is

that
matters
is
the
courage
you
bring
to
it
this
from
old
frosted
moses
in
the
warm
corner
by
the
door
there
might
have
been
an
answer
but
dicky
tasset
the
town
idiot
filled
in
the
pause
with
the
tale
that
he
was
telling
mother
figgis
and
i
ran
a
mile
or
more
with
the
stars
dotted
all
over
the
ground
for
yer
pickin
as
yer
might
say
a
little
boy
peter
westcott
heard
what
old
frosted
moses
had
said
and
turned
it
over
in
his
mind
he
was
twelve
years
old
was
short
and
and
just
now
looked
very
small
because
he
was
perched
on
so
high
a
chair
it
was
one
of
the
four
ancient
chairs
that
sam
figgis
always
kept
in
the
great
kitchen
behind
the
taproom
he
kept
them
there
partly
because
they
were
so
very
old
and
partly
because
they
fell
in
so
pleasantly
with
the
ancient
colour
and
strength
of
the
black
smoky
rafters
the
four
ancient
chairs
were
carved
up
the
legs
with
faces
and
arms
and
strange
crawling
animals
and
their
backs
were
twisted
into
the
oddest
shapes
and
were
uncomfortable
to
lean
against
but
peter
westcott
sat
up
very
straight
with
his
little
legs
dangling
in
front
of
him
and
his
grey
eyes
all
over
the
room
at
once
he
could
not
see
all
of
the
room
because
there
were
depths
that
the
darkness
seized
and
filled
and
the
great
fiery
place
with
its
settle
was
full
of
mysterious
shadows
a
huge
fire
was
burning
and
leaping
in
the
fastnesses
of
that
stone
cavity
and
it
was
by
the
light
of
this
alone
that
the
room
was
illumined
and
this
had
the
effect
as
peter
noticed
of
making
certain
people
like
mother
figgis
and
jane
clewer
quite
monstrous
and
fantastic
with
their
skirts
and
hair
and
their
shadows
on
the
wall
before
frosted
moses
had
said
that
sentence
about
courage
peter
had
been
taking
the
room
in
because
he
had
been
there
very
often
before
he
knew
every
flagstone
in
the
floor
and
every
rafter
in
the
roof
and
all
the
sporting
pictures
on
the
walls
and
the
long
shining
row
of
mugs
and
coloured
plates
by
the
and
the
cured
hams
hanging
from
the
ceiling
but
was
christmas
eve
and
a
very
especial
occasion
and
he
was
sure
to
be
beaten
when
he
got
home
and
so
must
make
the
very
most
of
his
time
he
watched
the
door
also
for
stephen
brant
who
was
late
but
might
arrive
at
any
moment
had
it
not
been
for
stephen
brant
peter
knew
that
he
would
not
have
been
allowed
there
at
all
the
order
of
the
kitchen
was
jealously
guarded
and
sam
figgis
the
would
have
considered
so
small
a
child
a
nuisance
but
stephen
was
the
most
popular
man
in
the
county
and
he
had
promised
that
peter
would
be
quiet
and
he
quiet
even
at
that
age
no
one
could
be
so
quiet
as
peter
when
he
chose
and
then
they
liked
the
boy
after
a
time
he
was
never
in
the
way
and
he
was
wonderfully
wise
for
his
years
he
was
a
strong
kid
too
and
had
muscles
so
peter
crept
there
when
he
could
although
it
very
often
meant
a
beating
afterwards
but
the
kitchen
was
worth
a
good
many
beatings
and
he
would
have
gone
through
hell
and
did
indeed
go
through
his
own
special
hell
on
many
occasions
to
be
in
stephen
company
they
were
all
nice
to
him
even
when
stephen
was
there
but
there
were
other
reasons
besides
the
people
that
drew
peter
to
the
place
it
was
partly
perhaps
because
the
bending
mule
was
built
right
out
into
the
sea
being
surrounded
on
three
sides
by
water
this
was
all
twenty
years
ago
and
i
believe
that
now
the
inn
has
been
turned
into
an
arts
club
and
there
are
and
weekly
fashion
papers
where
there
had
once
been
those
bloody
fights
and
mother
figgis
sitting
like
some
witch
over
the
fire
but
it
is
no
matter
treliss
is
changed
of
course
and
so
is
the
world
and
there
are
politeness
and
sentiment
where
once
there
were
oaths
and
ferocity
and
there
is
much
soap
instead
of
grimy
hands
and
unwashen
faces
and
the
fishing
is
sadly
on
the
decline
but
there
are
good
drapers
shops
in
the
town
for
peter
the
charm
of
the
place
was
that
he
was
out
at
one
could
hear
quite
distinctly
the
lap
of
the
waves
against
the
walls
and
on
stormy
nights
the
water
screamed
and
fought
and
raged
outside
and
rolled
in
thundering
echoes
along
the
shore
everything
was
still
and
the
snow
was
falling
heavily
solemnly
over
the
town
the
snow
and
the
black
sea
and
the
lights
that
rose
tier
on
tier
like
crowds
at
a
circus
could
be
seen
through
the
uncurtained
windows
the
snow
and
quiet
of
the
world
made
the
lights
and
warmth
of
the
room
the
more
comforting
and
exciting
and
sam
figgis
had
hung
holly
about
the
walls
and
dangled
a
huge
bunch
of
mistletoe
from
the
middle
beam
and
poor
jane
clewer
was
always
walking
under
it
accidentally
and
waiting
a
little
but
nobody
kissed
her
these
things
peter
noticed
he
also
noticed
that
dicky
the
idiot
was
allowed
to
be
present
as
a
very
great
favour
because
it
was
christmas
eve
and
snowing
so
hard
that
the
room
was
more
crowded
than
he
had
ever
seen
it
and
that
mother
figgis
with
her
round
face
and
her
gnarled
and
knotted
hands
was
at
her
very
merriest
and
in
the
best
of
tempers
all
these
things
peter
had
noticed
before
frosted
moses
so
called
because
of
his
long
white
beard
and
wonderful
age
made
his
remark
about
courage
but
as
soon
as
that
remark
was
made
peter
thoughts
were
on
to
it
as
the
hounds
are
on
to
a
fox
is
life
that
matters
but
the
courage
yer
bring
to
it
that
of
course
at
once
explained
everything
it
explained
his
own
father
and
his
home
it
explained
poor
prothero
and
her
two
sons
who
were
drowned
it
explained
stephen
cousin
who
was
never
free
from
the
most
painful
rheumatics
and
it
explained
stephen
himself
who
was
never
afraid
of
any
one
or
anything
peter
stared
at
frosted
moses
whose
white
beard
was
shining
in
the
and
his
boots
were
like
large
black
boats
but
the
old
man
was
drawing
at
his
pipe
and
had
made
his
remark
apparently
in
connection
with
nothing
at
all
peter
was
also
disappointed
to
see
that
the
room
at
large
had
paid
no
attention
to
the
declaration
courage
that
was
what
they
were
all
there
for
and
soon
later
in
the
evening
he
would
take
his
beating
like
a
man
and
would
not
cry
out
as
he
had
done
the
last
time
and
then
at
the
thought
of
the
beating
he
shivered
a
little
on
his
tall
chair
and
his
two
short
legs
in
their
black
stockings
beat
against
the
wooden
bars
and
wished
that
he
might
have
stayed
in
some
dark
corner
of
the
bending
mule
during
the
rest
of
the
night
and
not
go
home
until
the
morning
or
indeed
a
very
much
better
and
happier
thing
never
go
home
again
at
all
he
would
get
a
worse
beating
for
staying
out
so
late
but
it
was
something
of
a
comfort
to
reflect
that
he
would
have
been
beaten
in
any
case
old
simon
parlow
who
taught
him
mathematics
and
latin
with
a
little
geography
and
history
during
six
days
of
the
week
had
given
him
that
morning
a
letter
to
his
father
directed
in
the
old
man
most
beautiful
handwriting
to
the
effect
that
master
westcott
had
made
no
progress
at
all
in
his
sums
during
the
last
fortnight
had
indeed
made
no
attempt
at
progress
and
had
given
william
daffoll
the
rector
son
a
bleeding
nose
last
wednesday
when
he
ought
to
have
been
adding
dividing
and
subtracting
old
parlow
had
shown
him
the
letter
so
that
peter
knew
that
there
was
no
escape
unless
indeed
peter
destroyed
the
paper
and
that
only
meant
that
punishment
was
deferred
yes
it
meant
a
beating
and
peter
had
hung
about
the
town
and
the
shore
all
the
afternoon
and
evening
because
he
was
afraid
this
fact
of
his
fear
puzzled
him
and
he
had
often
considered
the
matter
he
was
not
in
any
other
way
a
coward
and
he
had
done
on
many
occasions
things
that
other
friends
of
his
own
age
had
hung
back
from
but
the
thought
of
his
father
made
him
quite
sick
with
fear
somewhere
in
the
middle
of
his
stomach
he
considered
the
matter
very
carefully
and
he
decided
at
last
and
he
was
very
young
for
so
terrible
a
discovery
that
it
was
because
his
father
liked
beating
him
that
he
was
afraid
he
knew
that
his
father
liked
it
because
he
had
watched
his
mouth
and
had
heard
the
noise
that
came
through
his
lips
and
this
again
was
rather
strange
because
his
father
did
not
look
as
though
he
would
like
it
he
had
a
cold
face
like
a
stone
and
was
always
in
black
clothes
but
he
did
not
as
a
rule
show
that
he
was
pleased
or
angry
or
sorry
he
never
showed
things
now
these
words
of
frosted
moses
explained
everything
it
was
because
his
father
knew
that
it
was
courage
that
mattered
that
he
liked
to
beat
peter
it
was
good
for
peter
to
learn
courage
is
life
that
matters
it
is
a
beating
that
matters
frosted
moses
was
a
great
deal
wiser
than
old
simon
parlow
who
in
spite
of
his
knowing
so
much
about
sums
knew
nothing
whatever
about
life
he
knew
nothing
whatever
about
courage
either
and
shook
like
a
leaf
when
his
sister
miss
jessel
parlow
was
angry
with
him
as
she
very
often
had
reason
to
be
peter
despised
the
old
man
with
his
long
yellow
tooth
that
hung
over
his
lower
lip
and
his
dirty
grey
hair
that
strayed
from
under
his
greasy
black
velvet
cap
like
wisps
of
hay
peter
never
cared
anything
for
the
words
or
the
deeds
of
old
parlow
but
frosted
moses
he
had
lived
for
ever
and
people
said
that
he
could
never
die
peter
had
heard
that
he
had
been
in
the
ark
with
noah
and
he
had
often
wished
to
ask
him
questions
about
that
interesting
period
about
ham
shem
and
japheth
and
about
the
animals
of
course
therefore
he
knew
everything
about
life
and
this
remark
of
his
about
courage
was
worth
considering
peter
watched
him
very
solemnly
and
noticed
how
his
white
beard
shone
in
the
how
there
was
a
red
handkerchief
falling
out
of
one
enormous
pocket
and
how
there
was
a
big
silver
ring
on
one
brown
and
bony
finger
and
then
the
crowd
of
sailors
at
the
door
parted
and
stephen
brant
came
in
ii
stephen
brant
the
most
wonderful
person
in
the
world
always
through
life
peter
must
have
his
most
wonderful
person
and
sometimes
those
heroes
knew
of
it
and
lived
up
to
his
worshipping
and
sometimes
they
knew
of
it
and
could
not
live
up
to
it
but
most
frequently
they
never
knew
because
peter
did
not
let
them
see
this
hero
worship
is
at
the
back
of
a
great
deal
that
happened
to
peter
of
a
great
deal
of
his
sorrow
and
of
all
of
his
joy
and
he
would
not
have
been
peter
without
it
very
often
these
heroes
poor
things
came
tumbling
from
their
pedestals
often
they
came
in
very
shame
down
of
their
own
accord
and
perhaps
of
them
all
stephen
only
was
worthy
of
his
elevation
and
he
never
knew
that
he
was
elevated
he
knew
now
of
course
that
peter
loved
him
but
peter
was
a
little
boy
and
was
taken
by
persons
who
were
strong
and
liked
a
laugh
and
were
kind
in
little
ways
stephen
knew
that
when
peter
grew
older
he
must
love
other
and
wiser
people
he
was
a
very
large
man
six
foot
three
and
broad
with
a
brown
beard
and
grey
eyes
like
peter
he
had
been
a
fisherman
but
now
he
was
a
farmer
because
it
paid
better
he
had
an
old
mother
one
enemy
and
very
many
friends
he
had
loved
a
girl
and
she
had
been
engaged
to
him
for
two
years
but
another
man
had
taken
her
away
and
married
her
and
that
is
why
he
had
an
enemy
he
greeted
his
friends
and
kissed
poor
jane
clewer
under
the
mistletoe
and
then
kissed
old
mother
figgis
who
pushed
him
away
with
a
laugh
and
coom
up
there
where
are
yer
at
and
peter
watched
him
until
his
turn
also
should
come
his
legs
were
beating
the
wooden
bars
again
with
excitement
but
he
would
not
say
anything
he
saw
stephen
as
something
very
much
larger
and
more
stupendous
than
any
one
else
in
the
room
there
were
men
there
bigger
of
body
perhaps
and
men
who
were
richer
stephen
had
only
four
cows
on
his
farm
and
he
never
did
much
with
his
hay
but
there
was
no
one
who
could
change
a
room
simply
by
entering
it
as
stephen
could
at
last
the
moment
came
stephen
turned
round
why
boy
peter
was
glad
that
the
rest
of
the
room
was
busied
once
more
with
its
talking
laughing
and
drinking
and
some
old
man
sitting
on
a
table
and
his
nose
coming
through
the
like
a
rat
through
a
hole
in
the
wall
had
struck
up
a
tune
on
a
fiddle
peter
was
glad
because
no
one
watched
them
together
he
liked
to
meet
stephen
in
private
he
buried
his
small
hand
in
the
brown
depths
of
stephen
large
one
and
then
as
stephen
looked
uncertainly
round
the
room
he
whispered
steve
my
chair
and
me
sitting
on
you
it
was
a
piece
of
impertinence
to
call
him
steve
of
course
and
when
other
people
were
there
it
was
mr
brant
but
in
their
own
privacy
it
was
their
own
affair
peter
slipped
down
from
his
chair
and
stephen
sat
down
on
it
and
then
peter
was
lifted
up
and
leant
his
head
back
somewhere
against
the
middle
button
of
stephen
waistcoat
just
where
his
heart
was
noisiest
and
he
could
feel
the
hard
outline
of
enormous
silver
watch
that
his
family
had
had
so
stephen
said
for
a
hundred
years
now
was
the
blissful
time
the
perfect
moment
the
rest
of
the
world
was
busied
with
life
the
window
showed
the
dull
and
then
suddenly
shining
flakes
of
snow
the
lights
and
the
limitless
sea
the
room
showed
the
sanded
floor
the
crowd
of
fishermen
drinking
their
feet
moving
already
to
the
tune
of
the
fiddle
the
fisher
girls
with
their
coloured
shawls
the
great
swinging
smoky
lamp
the
huge
fire
dicky
the
fool
mother
figgis
fat
sam
the
host
old
frosted
moses
the
gay
romantic
world
and
these
two
in
their
corner
and
peter
so
happy
that
no
beatings
in
the
world
could
terrify
but
boy
says
stephen
bending
down
so
that
the
end
of
his
beard
tickles
peter
neck
what
are
yer
doing
here
so
late
your
father
i
going
back
to
be
beaten
of
if
yer
go
now
perhaps
yer
wo
be
beaten
so
bad
oh
steve
i
staying
like
this
but
peter
knew
in
spite
of
the
way
that
the
big
brown
hand
pressed
his
white
one
in
sympathy
that
stephen
was
worried
and
that
he
was
thinking
of
something
he
knew
although
he
could
not
see
that
stephen
eyes
were
staring
right
across
the
room
and
that
they
were
looking
in
the
way
that
they
had
past
walls
and
windows
and
streets
somewhere
for
something
peter
knew
a
little
about
stephen
trouble
he
did
not
understand
it
altogether
but
he
had
seen
the
change
in
stephen
and
he
knew
that
he
was
often
very
sad
and
that
moods
came
upon
him
when
he
could
do
nothing
but
think
and
watch
and
wait
and
then
his
face
grew
very
grey
and
his
eyes
very
hard
and
his
hands
were
clenched
peter
knew
that
stephen
had
an
enemy
and
that
one
day
he
would
meet
him
some
of
the
men
and
girls
were
dancing
now
in
the
middle
of
the
room
the
floor
and
the
walls
shook
a
little
with
the
noise
that
the
heavy
boots
of
the
fishermen
made
and
the
smoky
lamp
swung
from
side
to
side
the
heat
was
great
and
some
one
opened
the
window
and
the
snow
came
swirling
in
little
waves
and
eddies
in
and
out
blown
by
the
breeze
dark
and
heavy
outside
against
the
clouded
sky
white
and
delicate
and
swiftly
vanishing
in
the
room
dicky
the
fool
came
across
the
floor
and
talked
to
stephen
in
his
smiling
rambling
way
people
pitied
dicky
and
shook
their
heads
when
his
name
was
mentioned
but
peter
never
could
understand
this
because
the
fool
seemed
always
to
be
happy
and
cheerful
and
he
saw
so
many
things
that
other
people
never
saw
at
all
it
was
only
when
he
was
drunk
that
he
was
unhappy
and
he
was
pleased
with
such
very
little
things
and
he
told
such
stories
stephen
was
always
kind
to
the
fool
and
the
fool
worshipped
him
but
peter
saw
that
he
was
paying
no
heed
to
the
fool
talk
the
fool
had
a
story
about
three
stars
that
he
had
seen
rolling
down
the
grey
hill
and
behold
when
they
got
to
the
bottom
little
bright
nickety
things
like
new
saxpennies
it
was
suddenly
so
dark
that
dicky
had
to
light
his
lantern
and
grope
his
way
home
with
that
and
all
the
frogs
began
croaking
down
in
the
marsh
terrible
now
what
was
the
meaning
of
that
but
stephen
was
paying
no
attention
his
eyes
were
set
on
the
open
window
and
the
drifting
snow
men
came
in
stamping
their
great
boots
on
the
floor
and
rubbing
their
hands
together
the
fiddle
was
playing
more
madly
than
ever
and
at
every
moment
some
couple
would
stop
under
the
mistletoe
and
the
girl
would
scream
and
laugh
and
the
man
kiss
could
be
heard
all
over
the
room
through
the
open
window
came
the
sound
of
church
bells
stephen
bent
down
and
whispered
in
the
boy
ear
yer
best
be
going
now
peter
lad
is
nine
and
chance
if
yer
go
back
now
yer
lickin
not
be
so
but
peter
whispered
back
not
yet
stephen
a
little
while
peter
was
tremendously
excited
he
could
never
remember
being
quite
so
excited
before
it
was
all
very
thrilling
of
course
with
the
dancing
and
the
music
and
the
lights
but
there
was
more
than
that
in
it
stephen
was
so
unlike
himself
but
then
possibly
christmas
made
him
sad
because
he
would
be
thinking
of
last
christmas
and
the
happy
time
that
he
had
had
because
his
girl
had
been
with
him
but
there
was
more
than
that
in
it
then
suddenly
a
curious
thing
happened
to
peter
he
was
not
asleep
he
was
not
even
drowsy
he
was
sitting
with
his
eyes
wide
open
staring
at
the
window
he
saw
the
window
with
its
dark
frame
and
he
saw
the
snow
and
then
in
an
instant
the
room
the
people
the
music
the
tramping
of
feet
the
roar
of
voices
these
things
were
all
swept
away
and
instead
there
was
absolute
stillness
only
the
noise
that
a
little
wind
makes
when
it
rustles
through
the
blades
of
grass
and
above
him
rose
the
grey
hill
with
its
funny
top
and
against
it
heavy
black
clouds
were
driving
outlined
sharply
against
the
sky
was
the
straight
stone
pillar
that
stood
in
the
summit
of
the
grey
hill
and
was
called
by
the
people
the
giant
finger
he
could
hear
some
sheep
crying
in
the
distance
and
the
tinkling
of
their
bells
then
suddenly
the
picture
was
swept
away
and
the
room
and
the
people
and
the
dancing
were
before
him
and
around
him
once
more
he
was
not
surprised
by
this
it
had
happened
to
him
before
at
the
most
curious
times
he
had
seen
in
the
same
way
the
grey
hill
and
the
giant
finger
and
he
had
felt
the
cold
wind
about
his
neck
and
always
something
had
happened
stephen
he
whispered
stephen
but
stephen
hand
was
crushing
his
hand
like
an
iron
glove
and
stephen
eyes
were
staring
like
the
eyes
of
a
wild
animal
at
the
door
a
man
a
short
square
man
with
a
muffler
round
his
throat
and
a
little
mouth
and
little
ears
had
come
in
and
was
standing
by
the
door
looking
round
the
room
stephen
whispered
gently
in
peter
ear
run
home
peter
boy
and
he
kissed
him
very
softly
on
the
cheek
then
he
put
him
down
on
the
floor
stephen
rose
from
his
chair
and
stood
for
an
instant
staring
at
the
door
then
he
walked
across
the
room
brushing
the
people
aside
and
tapped
the
little
man
with
the
muffler
on
the
shoulder
samuel
burstead
he
said
good
evenin
to
iii
all
the
room
seemed
to
cease
moving
and
talking
at
the
moment
when
stephen
brant
said
that
they
stood
where
they
were
like
the
people
in
the
and
peter
climbed
up
on
to
his
chair
again
to
see
what
was
going
to
happen
he
pulled
up
his
stockings
and
then
sat
forward
in
his
chair
with
his
eyes
gazing
at
stephen
and
his
hands
very
tightly
clenched
when
afterwards
he
grew
up
and
thought
at
all
about
his
childhood
this
scene
always
remained
over
and
beyond
all
the
others
he
wondered
sometimes
why
it
was
that
he
remembered
it
all
so
clearly
that
he
had
it
so
dramatically
and
forcibly
before
him
when
many
more
recent
happenings
were
clouded
and
dull
but
when
he
was
older
he
knew
that
it
was
because
it
stood
for
so
much
of
his
life
it
was
because
that
christmas
eve
in
those
dim
days
was
really
the
beginning
of
everything
and
in
the
later
interpretation
of
it
so
much
might
be
understood
but
to
a
boy
of
that
age
the
things
that
stood
out
were
not
of
necessity
the
right
things
and
any
unreality
that
it
might
have
had
was
due
perhaps
to
his
fastening
on
the
incidental
fantastic
things
that
a
small
child
notices
always
more
vividly
than
a
grown
person
in
the
very
first
instant
of
stephen
speaking
to
the
man
with
the
muffler
it
was
dicky
the
fool
open
mouth
and
staring
eyes
that
showed
peter
how
important
it
was
the
fool
had
risen
from
his
chair
and
was
standing
leaning
forward
his
back
black
against
the
blazing
fire
his
silly
mouth
agape
and
great
terror
in
his
eyes
being
odd
in
his
mind
he
felt
perhaps
something
in
the
air
that
the
others
did
not
feel
and
peter
seemed
to
catch
fright
from
his
staring
eyes
the
man
at
the
door
had
turned
round
when
stephen
brant
spoke
to
him
and
had
pushed
his
way
out
of
the
crowd
of
men
and
stood
alone
fingering
his
neck
i
here
stephen
brant
if
yer
want
sam
figgis
came
forward
then
and
said
something
to
stephen
and
then
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
went
back
to
his
wife
he
seemed
to
feel
that
no
one
could
interfere
between
the
two
men
it
was
too
late
for
interference
then
things
happened
very
quickly
peter
saw
that
they
had
all
men
and
women
crowded
back
against
the
benches
and
the
wall
and
were
watching
very
silently
and
with
great
excitement
he
found
it
very
difficult
to
see
but
he
bent
his
head
and
peered
through
the
legs
of
a
big
fisherman
in
front
of
him
he
was
shaking
all
over
his
body
stephen
had
never
before
appeared
so
terrible
to
him
he
had
seen
him
when
he
was
very
angry
and
when
he
was
cross
and
but
now
he
was
very
ominous
in
his
quiet
way
and
his
eyes
seemed
to
have
changed
colour
the
small
boy
could
only
see
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
pieces
of
legs
and
skirts
and
trousers
but
he
knew
by
the
feeling
in
the
room
that
stephen
and
the
little
man
were
going
to
fight
then
he
moved
his
head
round
and
saw
between
two
shoulders
and
he
saw
that
the
two
men
were
stripping
to
the
waist
the
centre
of
the
room
was
cleared
and
sam
figgis
came
forward
to
speak
to
stephen
again
and
this
time
there
was
more
noise
and
the
people
began
to
shout
out
loud
and
the
men
grew
more
and
more
excited
there
had
often
been
fights
in
that
room
before
and
peter
had
witnessed
one
or
two
but
there
had
never
been
this
solemnity
and
ceremony
every
one
was
very
grave
it
did
not
occur
to
peter
that
it
was
odd
that
it
should
be
allowed
no
one
thought
of
policemen
twenty
years
ago
in
treliss
and
sam
figgis
was
more
of
a
monarch
in
the
bending
mule
than
queen
victoria
and
now
two
of
the
famous
old
chairs
were
placed
at
opposite
corners
and
quite
silently
two
men
with
serious
faces
as
though
this
were
the
most
important
hour
of
their
life
stood
behind
them
stephen
and
the
other
man
stripped
to
their
short
woollen
drawers
came
into
the
middle
of
the
room
stephen
had
hair
all
over
his
chest
and
his
arms
and
his
neck
were
tremendous
and
peter
as
he
looked
at
him
thought
that
he
must
be
the
strongest
man
in
the
world
his
enemy
was
smooth
and
shiny
but
he
seemed
very
strong
and
you
could
see
the
muscles
of
his
arms
and
legs
move
under
his
skin
some
one
had
marked
a
circle
with
chalk
and
all
the
men
and
women
quite
silent
now
made
a
dark
line
along
the
wall
the
lamp
in
the
middle
of
the
room
was
still
swinging
a
little
and
they
had
forgotten
to
close
the
window
so
that
the
snow
which
was
falling
more
lightly
now
came
in
little
clouds
with
breaths
of
wind
into
the
room
and
the
bells
were
yet
pealing
and
could
be
heard
very
plainly
against
the
silence
then
sam
figgis
who
was
standing
with
his
legs
wide
apart
said
something
that
peter
could
not
catch
and
a
little
sigh
of
excitement
went
up
all
round
the
room
peter
who
was
clutching
his
chair
with
both
hands
and
choking
very
painfully
in
his
throat
knew
although
he
had
no
reason
for
his
knowledge
that
the
little
man
with
the
shining
chest
meant
to
kill
stephen
if
he
could
the
two
men
moved
round
the
circle
very
slowly
with
their
fists
clenched
and
their
eyes
watching
every
movement
then
suddenly
they
closed
at
once
peter
saw
that
the
little
man
was
very
clever
cleverer
than
stephen
he
moved
with
amazing
quickness
stephen
blows
came
like
and
sometimes
they
fell
with
a
dull
heavy
sound
on
the
other
man
face
and
on
his
chest
but
more
often
they
missed
altogether
the
man
seemed
to
be
everywhere
at
once
and
although
the
blows
that
he
gave
stephen
seemed
to
have
little
effect
yet
he
got
past
the
other
defence
again
and
again
then
again
the
figures
in
front
of
peter
closed
in
and
he
saw
nothing
he
stood
on
his
chair
no
one
noticed
him
now
but
he
could
not
see
his
face
was
very
white
and
his
stockings
had
fallen
down
over
his
boots
but
with
every
movement
he
was
growing
more
afraid
he
caught
an
instant
vision
of
stephen
face
and
he
saw
that
it
was
white
and
that
he
was
breathing
hard
the
room
seemed
to
be
ominously
silent
and
then
men
would
break
out
into
strange
threatening
sounds
and
peter
could
see
one
woman
a
young
girl
with
a
red
shawl
about
her
shoulders
her
back
against
the
wall
staring
with
a
white
face
he
could
not
see
he
could
not
see
he
murmured
once
very
politely
he
thought
he
said
it
aloud
but
it
was
really
under
his
breath
please
please
would
you
mind
if
you
stood
aside
just
a
little
but
the
man
in
front
of
him
was
absorbed
and
heard
nothing
then
he
knew
that
there
was
a
pause
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
brick
floor
and
he
saw
that
stephen
was
sitting
back
in
his
chair
his
face
was
white
and
blood
was
trickling
out
from
the
corner
of
his
mouth
on
to
his
beard
then
peter
remembered
old
frosted
words
the
courage
you
bring
to
it
and
he
sat
back
in
his
chair
again
and
with
hands
clenched
waited
he
would
be
brave
braver
than
he
had
ever
been
before
and
perhaps
in
some
strange
way
his
bravery
would
help
stephen
he
determined
with
all
the
power
that
he
had
to
be
brave
they
had
begun
again
he
heard
the
sound
of
the
blows
the
movement
of
the
men
feet
on
the
rough
brick
of
the
floor
people
cried
out
the
man
in
front
of
him
pressed
forward
and
he
had
a
sudden
view
stephen
was
on
one
knee
and
his
head
was
down
and
the
other
man
was
standing
over
him
it
was
all
over
stephen
was
beaten
stephen
would
be
killed
and
in
another
minute
peter
would
have
pushed
past
the
people
and
run
into
the
middle
of
the
room
but
sam
figgis
had
again
come
forward
and
the
two
men
were
in
their
chairs
again
there
followed
another
terrible
time
when
peter
could
see
nothing
he
waited
he
could
hear
them
moving
again
the
noise
of
their
breathing
and
of
their
feet
the
men
in
the
crowd
were
pressing
nearer
but
there
was
no
word
spoken
he
must
see
at
all
costs
he
must
see
and
he
climbed
down
from
his
chair
and
crept
unnoticed
towards
the
front
nobody
saw
him
or
realised
him
stephen
was
bending
back
he
seemed
to
be
slowly
sinking
down
the
other
man
from
whose
face
blood
was
now
streaming
was
pressing
on
to
him
peter
knew
that
it
was
all
over
and
that
there
was
no
hope
there
was
a
dreadful
cold
hard
pain
in
his
throat
and
he
could
scarcely
see
courage
he
must
have
it
for
stephen
with
every
bit
of
his
soul
and
his
mind
and
his
body
he
was
brave
he
stood
taut
his
little
legs
stiff
beneath
him
and
flung
defiance
at
the
world
he
and
stephen
were
fighting
that
shiny
man
together
both
of
them
now
courage
stephen
head
lifted
a
little
and
then
slowly
peter
saw
him
pulling
his
body
together
he
grew
rigid
he
raised
his
head
and
as
a
tree
falls
his
fist
crashed
into
his
enemy
face
the
man
dropped
without
a
word
and
lay
motionless
it
was
over
stephen
gravely
watched
for
a
moment
the
senseless
body
and
then
sat
back
in
his
chair
his
head
bowed
on
his
chest
the
fight
had
not
perhaps
been
like
that
there
must
have
been
many
other
things
that
happened
but
that
was
always
how
peter
remembered
it
and
now
there
was
confusion
a
great
deal
of
noise
and
people
talking
very
loudly
but
stephen
said
nothing
at
all
he
did
not
look
at
the
body
again
but
when
he
had
recovered
a
little
still
without
a
word
to
any
one
and
with
his
eyes
grave
and
without
expression
he
moved
to
the
corner
where
his
clothes
lay
not
no
give
room
there
he
moving
and
from
the
back
of
the
crowd
the
fool
silly
face
peering
over
peter
crept
unnoticed
to
the
door
the
clocks
were
striking
ten
and
some
one
in
the
street
was
singing
he
pulled
up
his
stockings
and
fastened
his
garters
then
he
slipped
out
into
the
snow
and
saw
that
the
sky
was
full
of
stars
and
that
the
storm
had
passed
chapter
ii
how
the
westcott
family
sat
up
for
peter
i
the
boy
always
reckoned
that
walking
one
quickest
it
took
half
an
hour
from
the
door
of
the
bending
mule
to
scaw
house
where
his
father
lived
if
a
person
ran
all
the
way
twenty
minutes
would
perhaps
cover
it
but
most
of
the
time
the
road
went
up
hill
and
that
made
running
difficult
he
had
certainly
no
intention
of
running
there
were
too
many
things
to
think
about
that
meant
then
that
he
would
arrive
home
about
ten
and
there
would
be
his
aunt
and
his
grandfather
and
his
father
sitting
up
waiting
for
him
the
world
was
very
silent
and
the
snow
lay
on
the
round
cobbles
of
the
steep
street
with
a
bright
shining
whiteness
against
the
black
houses
and
the
dark
night
sky
treliss
principal
street
was
deserted
all
down
the
hill
red
lights
showed
in
the
windows
and
voices
could
be
heard
singing
and
laughing
because
on
christmas
eve
there
would
be
parties
and
merrymakings
peter
looked
a
tiny
and
rather
desolate
figure
against
the
snow
as
he
climbed
the
hill
there
was
a
long
way
to
go
there
would
be
green
street
at
the
top
past
the
post
office
then
down
again
into
the
square
where
the
tower
was
then
through
winding
turnings
up
the
hill
past
the
gates
and
dark
trees
of
the
man
at
arms
then
past
the
old
wall
of
the
town
and
along
the
wide
high
road
that
runs
above
the
sea
until
at
last
one
struck
the
common
and
hidden
in
a
black
clump
of
trees
so
black
on
a
night
like
this
the
grim
grey
stones
of
scaw
house
peter
was
not
afraid
of
being
alone
although
when
snow
had
fallen
everything
seemed
strange
and
monstrous
the
trees
were
like
animals
and
the
paths
of
all
the
world
were
swept
away
but
he
was
not
afraid
of
ghosts
he
was
too
accustomed
to
their
perpetual
company
old
frosted
moses
and
dicky
and
even
men
like
stephen
had
seen
ghosts
so
often
and
peter
himself
could
tell
odd
stories
about
the
grey
hill
no
ghosts
held
no
terror
but
very
slowly
the
shadow
of
all
that
he
must
very
soon
go
through
was
creeping
about
him
when
he
first
came
out
of
the
bending
mule
he
still
was
as
though
he
were
in
a
dream
everything
that
had
happened
there
that
evening
had
been
so
strange
so
amazing
that
it
belonged
to
the
world
of
dreams
it
was
of
the
very
stuff
of
them
and
that
vision
of
stephen
naked
bleeding
so
huge
and
so
terrible
was
not
to
be
easily
forgotten
but
as
he
climbed
the
steep
street
peter
knew
that
however
great
a
dream
that
might
be
there
was
to
be
no
dreaming
at
all
about
his
meeting
with
his
father
and
old
frosted
moses
philosophy
would
be
very
sadly
needed
as
he
climbed
the
hill
the
reaction
from
the
excitement
of
his
late
adventure
suddenly
made
him
very
miserable
indeed
so
that
he
had
an
immediate
impulse
to
cry
but
he
stood
still
in
the
middle
of
the
street
and
made
fists
with
his
hands
and
called
himself
a
damned
gawky
idiot
words
that
he
had
admired
in
the
mouth
of
sam
figgis
some
days
before
gawky
was
certainly
the
last
thing
that
he
was
but
it
was
a
nice
queer
word
and
it
helped
him
a
great
deal
the
worst
of
everything
was
that
he
had
had
a
number
of
beatings
lately
and
the
world
could
not
possibly
go
on
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
if
he
had
many
more
every
beating
made
matters
worse
and
his
own
desperate
attempts
to
be
good
and
to
merit
rewards
rather
than
chastisement
met
with
no
success
the
hopeless
fact
of
it
all
was
that
it
had
very
little
to
do
with
his
own
actions
his
father
behaved
in
the
same
way
to
every
one
and
trussit
the
housekeeper
old
curtis
the
gardener
aunt
jessie
and
all
the
servants
shook
under
his
tongue
and
the
cold
glitter
of
his
eyes
and
certainly
the
maids
would
long
ago
have
given
notice
and
departed
were
it
not
that
they
were
all
afraid
to
face
him
peter
knew
that
that
was
true
because
trussit
had
told
him
so
it
was
this
hopeless
feeling
of
indiscriminate
punishment
that
made
everything
so
bad
until
he
was
eight
years
old
peter
had
not
been
beaten
at
all
but
when
he
was
very
young
indeed
he
had
learnt
to
crawl
away
when
he
heard
his
father
step
and
he
had
never
cried
as
a
baby
because
his
nurse
white
scared
face
had
frightened
him
so
and
then
of
course
there
was
his
mother
his
poor
mother
that
was
another
reason
for
silence
he
never
saw
his
mother
for
more
than
a
minute
at
a
time
because
she
was
ill
had
been
ill
for
as
long
as
he
could
remember
when
he
was
younger
he
had
been
taken
into
his
mother
room
once
or
twice
a
week
by
trussit
and
he
had
bent
down
and
kissed
that
white
tired
face
and
he
had
smelt
the
curious
smell
in
the
room
of
flowers
and
medicine
and
he
had
heard
his
mother
voice
very
far
away
and
very
soft
and
he
had
crept
out
again
when
he
was
older
his
aunt
told
him
sometimes
to
go
and
see
his
mother
and
he
would
creep
in
alone
but
he
never
could
say
anything
because
of
the
whiteness
of
the
room
and
the
sense
of
something
sacred
like
church
froze
his
speech
he
had
never
seen
his
father
and
mother
together
his
mornings
were
always
spent
with
old
parlow
and
in
the
afternoon
he
was
allowed
to
ramble
about
by
himself
so
that
it
was
only
at
mealtimes
and
during
the
horrible
after
supper
before
he
went
up
to
bed
that
he
saw
his
father
he
really
saw
more
of
old
curtis
the
gardener
but
half
an
hour
with
his
father
could
seem
a
very
long
time
throughout
the
rest
of
his
life
that
after
supper
remained
at
the
back
of
his
mind
and
he
never
forgot
its
slightest
detail
the
hideous
with
the
large
photographs
of
old
grandfather
and
grandmother
westcott
in
clothes
and
heavy
gilt
frames
the
white
marble
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
a
clock
that
would
tick
solemnly
for
twenty
minutes
and
then
give
a
little
run
and
a
jump
for
no
reason
at
all
the
straight
horsehair
sofa
so
black
and
uncomfortable
with
its
hard
wooden
back
the
big
table
with
its
green
cloth
faded
a
little
in
the
middle
where
a
pot
with
a
fern
in
it
always
stood
and
his
aunt
with
her
frizzy
yellow
hair
her
black
mittens
and
her
long
bony
fingers
playing
her
interminable
patience
and
then
two
by
the
fire
in
one
of
them
old
grandfather
westcott
almost
invisible
beneath
a
load
of
rugs
and
cushions
and
only
the
white
hairs
on
the
top
of
his
head
sticking
out
like
some
strange
plant
and
in
the
other
chair
his
father
motionless
reading
the
last
of
all
sitting
up
straight
with
his
work
in
front
of
him
afraid
to
move
afraid
to
cough
sometimes
with
pins
and
needles
sometimes
with
a
maddening
impulse
to
sneeze
always
with
fascinated
glances
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
at
his
father
peter
himself
how
happy
he
was
when
the
marble
clock
struck
nine
and
he
was
released
how
snug
and
friendly
his
little
attic
bedroom
was
with
its
funny
window
under
the
shelving
roof
with
all
the
view
of
the
common
and
the
distant
hills
that
covered
truro
there
at
any
rate
he
was
free
he
was
passing
now
through
the
square
and
he
stopped
for
an
instant
and
looked
up
at
the
old
tower
that
guarded
one
side
of
it
and
looked
so
fine
and
stately
now
with
the
white
snow
at
its
foot
and
the
gleaming
sheet
of
stars
at
its
back
that
old
tower
had
stood
a
good
number
of
beatings
in
its
day
it
knew
well
enough
what
courage
was
and
so
peter
as
he
turned
up
the
hill
squared
his
shoulders
and
set
his
teeth
but
in
some
way
that
he
was
too
young
to
understand
he
felt
that
it
was
not
the
beating
itself
that
frightened
him
most
but
rather
all
the
circumstances
that
attended
it
it
was
even
the
dark
house
the
band
of
trees
about
it
that
first
dreadful
moment
when
he
would
hear
his
knock
echo
through
the
passages
and
then
the
patter
of
slippers
as
she
came
to
open
the
door
for
him
then
trussit
fat
arm
and
the
candle
raised
above
her
head
and
oh
it
you
peter
and
then
the
opening
of
the
door
and
it
master
peter
sir
and
then
that
vision
of
the
marble
clock
and
his
father
face
behind
the
paper
these
things
were
unfair
and
more
than
any
one
deserved
he
had
had
beatings
on
several
occasions
when
he
had
merited
no
punishment
at
all
but
it
did
not
make
things
any
better
that
on
this
occasion
he
did
deserve
it
it
only
made
that
feeling
inside
his
chest
that
everything
was
so
hopeless
that
nothing
whatever
mattered
and
that
it
was
always
more
fun
to
be
beaten
for
a
sheep
than
a
lamb
stronger
than
ever
but
the
world
or
at
any
rate
the
scaw
house
portion
of
it
could
not
move
in
this
same
round
eternally
something
would
happen
and
the
vague
intention
that
had
been
in
his
mind
for
some
time
now
was
a
little
more
defined
one
day
like
his
three
companions
tom
jones
peregrine
pickle
and
david
copperfield
he
would
run
into
the
world
and
seek
his
fortune
and
then
afterwards
he
would
write
his
book
of
adventures
as
they
had
done
his
heart
beat
at
the
thought
and
he
passed
the
high
gates
and
dark
trees
of
the
man
at
arms
with
quick
step
and
head
high
he
was
growing
old
twelve
was
an
age
and
there
would
soon
be
a
time
when
beatings
must
no
longer
be
endured
he
shivered
when
he
thought
of
what
would
happen
then
the
mere
idea
of
defying
his
father
sent
shudders
down
his
back
but
he
was
twelve
he
would
soon
be
thirteen
but
this
scaw
house
with
its
strange
silence
and
distresses
was
only
half
his
life
there
was
the
other
existence
that
he
had
down
in
the
town
out
at
stephen
farm
wandering
alone
on
the
grey
hill
roaming
about
along
the
beach
and
in
amongst
the
caves
tramping
out
to
the
hearty
cow
a
little
inn
amongst
the
gorse
ten
miles
away
or
looking
for
the
lost
church
among
the
at
porthperran
all
these
things
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
his
father
and
old
parlow
and
his
lessons
and
it
was
undoubtedly
this
other
sort
of
life
that
he
would
lead
with
the
gipsies
and
the
tramps
when
the
time
came
for
him
to
run
away
he
knew
no
other
children
of
his
own
age
but
he
did
not
want
them
he
liked
best
to
talk
to
old
curtis
the
gardener
to
dicky
the
idiot
to
sam
figgis
when
that
splendid
person
would
permit
it
and
of
course
to
stephen
he
passed
the
old
town
wall
and
stepped
out
into
the
high
road
far
below
him
was
the
sea
above
him
a
sky
scattered
with
shining
stars
and
around
him
a
white
dim
world
turning
a
corner
the
road
lay
straight
before
him
and
to
the
right
along
the
common
was
the
black
clump
of
trees
that
hid
his
home
he
discovered
that
he
was
very
tired
it
had
been
a
most
exhausting
day
with
old
parlow
so
cross
in
the
morning
and
the
scene
in
the
inn
at
night
and
now
his
steps
fell
slower
and
slower
as
he
passed
along
the
road
one
hot
hand
was
clutching
parlow
note
and
in
his
throat
there
was
a
sharp
pain
that
made
it
difficult
to
swallow
and
his
eyes
were
burning
suppose
he
never
went
home
at
all
supposing
he
went
off
to
farm
it
was
a
long
way
and
he
might
lose
his
way
in
the
snow
but
his
heart
beat
like
a
hammer
when
he
thought
of
stephen
coming
to
the
door
and
of
the
little
spare
room
where
stephen
put
his
guests
to
sleep
but
no
stephen
would
not
want
him
he
would
be
very
tired
and
would
rather
be
alone
and
then
there
would
be
the
morning
when
it
would
be
every
bit
as
bad
and
perhaps
worse
but
if
he
ran
away
altogether
he
stopped
in
the
middle
of
the
road
and
thought
about
it
the
noise
of
the
sea
came
up
to
him
like
the
march
of
men
and
with
it
the
sick
melancholy
moan
of
the
bell
rock
but
the
rest
of
the
world
was
holding
its
breath
so
still
it
seemed
but
whither
should
he
run
he
could
not
run
so
far
away
that
his
father
could
not
find
him
his
father
arm
stretched
to
everywhere
in
the
world
and
then
it
was
cowardly
to
run
away
where
was
that
courage
of
which
he
had
been
thinking
so
much
so
he
shook
his
little
shoulders
and
pulled
up
those
stockings
again
and
turned
up
the
little
side
road
usually
so
full
of
ruts
and
stones
and
now
so
level
and
white
with
the
hard
snow
now
that
his
mind
was
made
up
he
marched
forward
with
unfaltering
step
and
clanged
the
iron
gates
behind
him
so
that
they
made
a
horrible
noise
and
stepped
through
the
desolate
garden
up
the
gravel
path
the
house
looked
black
and
grim
but
there
were
lights
behind
the
windows
it
was
there
that
they
were
sitting
of
course
as
he
stood
on
his
toes
to
reach
the
knocker
a
shooting
star
flashed
past
above
his
head
and
he
could
hear
the
bare
branches
of
the
trees
knocking
against
one
another
in
the
wind
that
always
seemed
to
be
whistling
round
the
house
the
noise
echoed
terribly
through
the
building
and
then
there
was
a
silence
that
was
even
more
terrible
he
could
fancy
how
his
aunt
would
start
and
put
down
her
patience
cards
for
a
moment
and
look
in
her
scared
way
at
the
window
he
knew
that
his
father
would
not
move
from
behind
his
paper
and
that
there
would
be
no
other
sound
unless
his
grandfather
awoke
he
heard
trussit
steps
down
the
passage
then
locks
were
turned
the
great
door
swung
slowly
open
and
he
saw
her
as
he
had
pictured
it
with
a
candle
in
her
hand
raised
above
her
head
peering
into
the
dark
oh
it
you
master
peter
and
she
stood
aside
without
another
word
to
let
him
in
he
slipped
past
her
silently
into
the
hall
and
after
a
second
pause
she
followed
him
in
banging
the
hall
door
behind
her
then
she
opened
the
door
announcing
grimly
it
master
peter
come
in
the
marble
clock
struck
ten
as
she
spoke
he
stood
just
inside
the
door
blinking
a
little
at
the
sudden
light
and
twisting
his
cloth
cap
round
and
round
in
his
hands
he
could
see
anything
at
first
and
he
could
not
collect
his
thoughts
at
last
he
said
in
a
very
little
voice
i
come
back
the
lights
settled
before
his
eyes
and
he
saw
them
all
exactly
as
he
had
thought
they
would
be
his
father
had
not
looked
up
from
his
paper
and
peter
could
see
the
round
bald
patch
on
the
top
of
his
head
aunt
jessie
was
talking
to
herself
about
her
cards
in
a
very
agitated
whisper
now
it
the
king
i
want
how
provoking
ah
there
the
seven
of
spades
the
six
and
the
oh
dear
it
a
club
and
not
looking
up
at
all
no
one
answered
his
remark
and
the
silence
was
broken
by
his
grandfather
waking
up
a
shrill
piping
voice
came
from
out
of
the
rugs
oh
dear
what
a
doze
i
had
it
must
be
eight
what
a
doze
for
an
old
man
to
have
on
such
a
cold
night
too
and
then
fell
asleep
again
immediately
at
last
peter
spoke
again
in
a
voice
that
seemed
to
come
from
quite
another
person
father
i
come
back
his
father
very
slowly
put
down
his
newspaper
and
looked
at
him
as
though
he
were
conscious
of
him
for
the
first
time
when
he
spoke
it
was
as
though
his
voice
came
out
of
the
ceiling
or
the
floor
because
his
face
did
not
seem
to
move
at
all
where
have
you
been
in
the
town
come
he
crossed
the
room
and
stood
in
front
of
the
fire
between
his
father
and
grandfather
he
was
tremendously
conscious
of
the
grim
and
dusty
cactus
plant
that
stood
on
a
little
table
by
the
window
what
have
you
been
doing
in
the
town
i
have
been
in
the
bending
mule
why
did
you
not
come
home
before
there
was
no
answer
you
knew
that
you
ought
to
come
home
yes
father
i
have
a
letter
for
you
from
parlow
he
said
that
i
was
to
tell
you
that
i
have
done
my
sums
very
badly
this
week
and
that
i
gave
willie
daffoll
a
bleeding
nose
on
wednesday
yes
have
you
any
excuse
for
these
things
no
very
well
you
may
go
up
to
your
room
i
will
come
up
to
you
yes
he
crossed
the
room
very
slowly
closed
the
door
softly
behind
him
and
then
climbed
the
dark
stairs
to
his
attic
ii
he
went
trembling
up
to
his
room
and
the
shook
in
his
hand
as
he
lit
his
candle
it
was
only
the
very
worst
beatings
that
happened
in
his
bedroom
his
father
gloomy
and
solemn
study
serving
as
a
background
on
more
unimportant
occasions
he
could
only
remember
two
other
beatings
in
the
attics
and
they
had
both
been
very
bad
ones
he
closed
his
door
and
then
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
the
little
window
was
open
and
the
glittering
of
the
myriad
stars
flung
a
light
over
his
room
and
shone
on
the
little
bracket
of
books
above
his
bed
a
bible
an
arabian
nights
and
tattered
copies
of
david
copperfield
vanity
fair
peregrine
pickle
tom
jones
and
harry
lorrequer
on
the
little
washing
stand
a
chest
of
drawers
a
chair
and
the
little
bed
there
were
no
pictures
on
the
walls
because
of
the
sloping
roof
but
there
were
two
china
vases
on
the
mantelpiece
and
they
were
painted
a
very
bright
blue
with
yellow
flowers
on
them
they
had
been
given
to
peter
by
flanders
the
rector
wife
who
had
rather
a
kind
feeling
for
peter
and
would
have
been
friendly
to
him
had
he
allowed
her
he
took
off
his
jacket
and
put
it
on
again
he
stood
uncertainly
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
wondered
whether
he
ought
to
undress
or
no
there
was
no
question
about
it
now
he
was
horribly
dreadfully
afraid
that
wisdom
of
old
frosted
moses
seemed
a
very
long
ago
and
it
was
of
very
little
use
if
it
had
all
happened
at
once
after
he
had
come
in
then
he
might
have
endured
it
but
this
waiting
and
listening
with
the
candle
guttering
was
too
much
for
him
his
father
was
so
very
strong
he
had
peter
figure
and
was
not
very
tall
and
was
very
broad
in
the
back
peter
had
seen
him
once
when
he
was
stripped
and
the
thought
of
it
always
frightened
him
his
face
was
white
and
his
teeth
would
chatter
although
he
bit
his
lips
and
his
fingers
shook
as
he
undressed
and
his
stud
slipped
and
he
could
not
undo
his
braces
and
always
his
ears
were
open
for
the
sound
of
the
step
on
the
stairs
at
last
he
was
in
his
and
a
very
melancholy
figure
he
looked
as
he
stood
shivering
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
it
was
not
only
that
he
was
going
to
be
beaten
it
was
also
that
he
was
so
lonely
stephen
seemed
so
dreadfully
far
away
and
he
had
other
things
to
think
about
he
wondered
whether
his
mother
in
that
strange
white
room
ever
thought
of
him
his
teeth
were
chattering
so
that
his
whole
head
shook
but
he
was
afraid
to
get
into
bed
because
then
he
might
go
to
sleep
and
it
would
be
so
frightening
to
be
woken
by
his
father
the
clock
downstairs
struck
eleven
and
he
heard
his
father
footstep
the
door
opened
and
his
father
came
in
holding
in
his
hand
the
cane
that
peter
knew
so
well
are
you
there
the
voice
was
very
cold
yes
do
you
know
that
you
ought
to
be
home
before
six
yes
and
that
i
dislike
your
going
to
the
bending
mule
yes
and
that
i
insist
on
your
doing
your
work
for
parlow
yes
and
that
you
are
not
to
fight
the
other
boys
in
the
town
yes
why
do
you
disobey
me
like
this
i
do
know
i
try
to
be
you
are
growing
into
an
idle
wicked
boy
you
are
a
great
trouble
to
your
mother
and
yes
father
i
want
to
be
even
now
he
could
admire
his
father
strength
the
the
dark
hair
but
he
was
cold
and
the
blood
had
come
where
he
bit
his
lip
because
he
must
not
cry
you
must
learn
obedience
take
off
your
he
took
it
off
and
was
a
very
small
naked
figure
in
the
starlight
but
his
head
was
up
now
and
he
faced
his
father
bend
over
the
he
bent
over
the
bed
and
the
air
from
the
window
cut
his
naked
back
he
buried
his
head
in
the
counterpane
and
fastened
his
teeth
in
it
so
that
he
should
not
cry
out
during
the
first
three
cuts
he
did
not
stir
then
an
intolerable
pain
seemed
to
move
through
his
body
it
was
as
though
a
knife
were
cutting
his
body
in
half
but
it
was
more
than
that
there
was
terror
with
him
now
in
the
room
he
heard
that
little
singing
noise
that
came
through
his
father
lips
he
knew
that
his
father
was
smiling
at
the
succeeding
strokes
his
flesh
quivered
and
shrank
together
and
then
opened
again
the
pain
was
intolerable
his
teeth
met
through
the
coverlet
and
grated
on
one
another
but
before
his
eyes
was
the
picture
of
stephen
slowly
straightening
himself
before
his
enemy
and
then
that
swinging
blow
he
would
not
cry
he
seemed
to
be
sharing
his
punishment
with
stephen
and
they
were
marching
hand
in
hand
down
a
road
lined
with
pokers
his
back
was
on
fire
and
his
head
was
bursting
and
the
soles
of
his
feet
were
very
very
cold
then
he
heard
from
a
long
way
away
his
father
voice
now
you
will
not
disobey
me
the
door
closed
very
slowly
he
raised
himself
but
moving
was
torture
he
put
on
his
and
then
quickly
caught
back
a
scream
as
it
touched
his
back
he
moved
to
the
window
and
closed
it
then
he
climbed
very
slowly
on
to
his
bed
and
the
tears
that
he
had
held
back
came
slowly
at
first
and
then
more
rapidly
at
last
in
torrents
it
was
not
the
pain
although
that
was
bad
but
it
was
the
misery
and
the
desolation
and
the
great
heaviness
of
a
world
that
held
out
no
hope
no
comfort
but
only
a
great
cloud
of
unrelieved
unhappiness
at
last
sick
with
crying
he
fell
asleep
iii
the
first
shadow
of
light
was
stealing
across
the
white
undulating
common
and
creeping
through
the
bare
trees
of
the
desolate
garden
when
four
dark
figures
one
tall
two
fat
and
one
small
stole
softly
up
the
garden
path
they
halted
beneath
the
windows
of
the
house
the
snow
had
ceased
falling
and
their
breath
rose
in
clouds
above
their
heads
they
danced
a
little
in
the
snow
and
drove
their
hands
together
and
then
the
tall
figure
said
now
tom
prother
out
with
thy
one
of
the
fat
figures
felt
in
his
coat
and
produced
four
papers
and
these
were
handed
round
bill
my
son
it
for
thee
to
lead
off
at
thy
brightest
mind
ye
let
have
it
the
small
figure
came
forward
and
began
at
first
his
voice
was
thin
and
quavering
but
in
the
second
line
it
gathered
courage
and
rang
out
full
and
bold
oi

under
a
sicymore

the
tall
figure
approvingly
but
the
cold
is
creepin
from
the
tips
o
my
fingers
till
my
singin
voice
is
most
frozen
now
and
the
birds
in
the
silent
garden
woke
amongst
the
ivy
on
the
distant
wall
and
listened

curled
up
like
the
birds
under
the
roof
stirred
uneasily
in
his
sleep
and
then
slowly
woke
he
moved
and
gave
a
little
cry
because
his
back
hurt
him
then
he
remembered
everything
the
voices
came
up
to
him
from
the
garden
did
whistle
and
mary
did
sing

on

at
he
got
slowly
out
of
bed
and
went
to
the
window
the
light
was
coming
in
broad
bands
from
the
east
and
he
could
hear
the
birds
in
the
ivy
the
four
black
figures
stood
out
against
the
white
shadowy
garden
and
their
heads
were
bent
together
he
opened
his
window
and
the
fresh
morning
air
swept
about
his
face
he
could
hear
the
whispers
of
the
singers
as
they
chose
another
carol
and
suddenly
above
the
dark
iron
gates
of
the
garden
appeared
the
broad
red
face
of
the
sun
chapter
iii
of
the
dark
shop
of
zachary
tan
and
of
the
decisions
that
the
people
in
scaw
house
came
to
concerning
peter
i
but
it
was
of
the
nature
of
the
whole
of
life
that
these
things
should
pass
look
back
on
this
bitterness
a
year
hence
and
see
how
trivial
it
seems
was
one
of
the
little
wisdoms
that
helped
peter
courage
in
after
years
and
to
a
boy
of
twelve
years
a
beating
is
forgotten
with
amazing
quickness
especially
if
it
is
a
week
of
holiday
and
there
have
been
other
beatings
not
so
very
long
before
it
left
things
behind
it
of
course
it
was
the
worst
beating
that
peter
had
ever
had
and
that
was
something
but
its
occurrence
marked
more
than
a
mere
crescendo
of
pain
and
that
evening
stood
for
some
new
resolution
that
he
did
not
rightly
understand
yet
something
that
was
in
its
beginning
the
mere
planting
of
a
seed
but
he
had
certainly
met
the
affair
in
a
new
way
and
although
in
the
week
that
followed
he
saw
his
father
very
seldom
and
spoke
to
him
not
at
all
beyond
good
morning
and
good
night
he
fancied
that
he
was
in
greater
favour
with
him
than
he
had
ever
been
before
there
were
always
days
of
silence
after
a
beating
and
that
was
more
markedly
the
case
now
when
it
was
a
week
of
holidays
and
no
parlow
to
go
to
peter
did
not
mind
the
silence
it
was
perhaps
safer
and
so
long
as
he
was
home
by
six
he
could
spend
the
day
where
he
pleased
he
asked
trussit
about
the
there
was
a
little
room
the
housekeeper
room
to
which
he
crept
when
he
thought
that
it
was
safe
to
do
so
she
was
a
different
trussit
within
the
boundary
of
her
kingdom
a
very
cosy
kingdom
with
pink
a
dark
red
sofa
a
canary
in
a
cage
and
a
fire
very
lively
in
the
grate
from
the
depths
of
a
big
her
black
silk
dress
rustling
a
little
every
now
and
then
her
knitting
needles
clinking
in
the
firelight
trussit
held
many
conversations
in
a
subdued
voice
with
peter
who
sat
on
the
table
and
swung
his
legs
she
was
valuable
from
two
points
of
view
as
an
historian
and
an
encyclopædia
she
had
been
in
the
first
place
in
the
most
wonderful
houses
the
earl
of
twinkerton
bambary
house
wiltshire
was
the
greatest
of
these
and
she
had
been
there
for
ten
years
there
were
also
lady
mettlesham
the
duchess
of
cranburn
and
to
peter
the
most
interesting
of
all
henry
galleon
the
famous
novelist
who
was
so
famous
that
american
ladies
used
to
creep
into
his
garden
and
pick
leaves
off
his
laurels
peter
had
from
her
a
dazzling
picture
of
wonderful
houses
of
staircases
and
garden
walks
of
thousands
and
thousands
of
shining
rooms
of
family
portraits
and
footmen
with
beautiful
legs
above
it
all
was
my
lady
who
was
always
beautiful
and
stately
and
of
course
devoted
to
trussit
why
that
good
woman
left
these
noble
mansions
for
so
dreary
a
place
as
scaw
house
peter
never
could
understand
and
for
many
years
that
remained
a
mystery
to
him
but
in
awed
whispers
he
asked
her
questions
about
the
lords
and
ladies
of
the
land
and
especially
about
the
famous
novelist
and
from
the
answers
given
to
him
constructed
a
complete
and
most
romantic
picture
of
the
peerage
but
as
an
encyclopædia
trussit
was
even
more
interesting
she
had
apparently
discovered
at
an
early
age
that
the
golden
rule
of
life
was
never
to
confess
yourself
defeated
by
any
question
whatever
and
there
was
therefore
nothing
that
he
could
ask
her
for
which
she
had
not
an
immediate
answer
ready
her
brow
was
always
unruffled
her
black
shining
hair
brushed
neatly
back
and
parted
down
the
middle
her
large
flat
face
always
composed
and
placid
and
her
voice
never
raised
above
a
whisper
the
only
sign
that
she
ever
gave
of
disturbance
was
a
little
clucking
noise
that
she
made
in
her
mouth
like
an
aroused
hen
peter
time
in
the
little
pink
was
sometimes
exceedingly
short
and
he
used
to
make
the
most
of
it
by
shooting
questions
at
the
good
lady
at
an
astonishing
rate
and
he
was
sometimes
irritated
by
her
slow
and
placid
replies
what
kind
of
stockings
did
galleon
wear
he
did
wear
stockings
unless
as
you
might
say
in
country
attire
and
then
if
i
remember
correctly
they
were
had
he
any
children
there
was
one
little
dear
when
i
had
the
honour
of
being
in
the
house
and
since
then
i
have
heard
that
there
are
two
mrs
trussit
where
do
children
come
from
they
are
brought
by
god
good
angels
when
we
are
all
asleep
in
the
night
oh
this
rather
doubtfully
a
pause
then
did
the
earl
of
twinkerton
have
hot
or
cold
baths
cold
in
the
morning
i
believe
with
the
chill
off
and
hot
at
night
before
dressing
for
dinner
he
was
a
very
cleanly
mrs
trussit
where
patagonia
it
came
in
the
history
this
north
of
the
caribbean
sea
i
believe
my
and
so
on
and
peter
never
forgot
any
of
her
answers
about
the
she
was
a
little
irritable
they
had
woken
her
it
seemed
from
a
very
delightful
sleep
and
she
considered
the
whole
affair
savoured
of
and
then
peter
found
suddenly
that
he
wish
to
talk
about
the
at
all
because
the
things
that
he
felt
about
them
were
in
some
curious
way
not
the
things
that
he
could
say
to
trussit
she
was
very
kind
to
him
during
that
christmas
week
and
gave
him
mixed
biscuits
out
of
a
brightly
shining
tin
that
she
kept
in
a
cupboard
in
her
room
but
outside
the
gates
of
her
citadel
she
was
a
very
different
person
spoke
to
peter
but
rarely
and
then
always
with
majesty
and
from
a
long
way
away
her
attitude
to
the
little
was
something
very
wonderful
indeed
and
even
to
aunt
jessie
her
tone
might
be
considered
patronising
but
indeed
to
aunt
jessie
it
was
very
difficult
to
be
anything
else
aunt
jessie
was
a
poor
creature
as
peter
discovered
very
early
in
life
he
found
that
she
never
had
any
answers
ready
to
the
questions
that
he
asked
her
and
that
she
hesitated
when
he
wished
to
know
whether
he
might
do
a
thing
or
no
she
was
always
trembling
and
shaking
and
no
person
ever
wore
mittens
he
had
a
great
contempt
for
his
aunt
on
new
year
eve
the
last
day
but
one
of
release
from
old
parlow
westcott
spent
the
day
doing
business
in
truro
and
at
once
the
atmosphere
over
scaw
house
seemed
to
lighten
the
snow
had
melted
away
and
there
was
a
ridiculous
feeling
of
spring
in
the
air
ridiculous
because
it
was
still
december
but
cornwall
is
often
surprisingly
warm
in
the
heart
of
winter
and
the
sun
was
shining
as
ardently
as
though
it
were
the
middle
of
june
the
sunlight
flooded
the
and
roused
old
grandfather
westcott
to
unwonted
life
so
that
he
stirred
in
his
chair
and
was
quite
unusually
talkative
he
stopped
peter
after
breakfast
as
he
was
going
out
of
the
room
and
called
him
to
his
side
is
that
the
sun
boy
yes
deary
me
to
think
of
that
and
me
a
poor
broken
old
man
not
able
to
move
an
arm
or
he
raised
himself
amongst
his
cushions
and
peter
saw
an
old
yellow
wrinkled
face
with
the
skin
drawn
tight
over
the
cheekbones
and
little
black
shining
eyes
like
drops
of
ink
a
wrinkled
claw
shot
out
and
clutched
peter
hand
do
you
love
your
grandfather
boy
of
course
that
right
that
right
on
a
nice
sunny
morning
too
do
you
love
your
father
boy
of
course
he
he
oh
yes
all
the
westcotts
love
their
fathers
loved
his
father
when
he
was
young
did
he
oh
yes
i
should
rather
think
and
his
voice
rose
into
a
shrill
scream
so
that
peter
jumped
then
he
began
to
look
peter
up
and
down
you
be
strong
boy
when
you
a
man
oh
yes
i
should
rather
think
so
i
was
strong
once
do
you
hear
that
i
was
strong
once
he
he
and
here
grandfather
westcott
overcome
by
his
chuckling
began
to
cough
so
badly
that
peter
was
afraid
that
he
was
going
to
be
ill
and
considered
running
for
aunt
jessie
hit
my
back
boy
huh
huh
ugh
ugh
that
right
hit
it
hard
better
ugh
ugh
oh
deary

nasty
cough
i

boy
hegh
hegh
indeed
i
was
just
like
your
father
and
he
be
just
like
me
one
day
oh
yes
he
will
blast
his
bones
he
he
we
all
come
to
it
all
of
us
strong
men
and
we
cruel
and
hard
and
wo
give
a
poor
old
man
enough
for
his
breakfast
and
then
suddenly
we
old
ourselves
and
what
fun
that
is
oh
yes
your
father
will
be
old
one
day
and
suddenly
delighted
with
the
thought
the
old
man
slipped
down
beneath
his
cushions
and
was
fast
asleep
and
peter
went
out
into
the
sunlight
ii
peter
looked
very
different
at
different
times
when
he
was
happy
his
cheeks
were
flooded
with
colour
his
eyes
shone
and
his
mouth
smiled
he
was
happy
now
and
he
forgot
as
he
came
out
into
the
garden
that
he
had
promised
his
aunt
that
he
would
go
in
and
see
his
mother
for
a
few
minutes
old
curtis
wearing
the
enormous
that
he
always
had
flapping
about
his
head
and
his
trousers
tied
below
his
knees
with
string
in
the
most
ridiculous
way
was
sweeping
the
garden
path
he
never
did
very
much
work
and
the
garden
was
in
a
shocking
state
of
neglect
but
he
told
delightful
stories
however
he
was
in
a
bad
temper
and
would
pay
no
attention
to
peter
at
all
and
so
peter
left
him
and
went
out
into
the
high
road
it
was
two
miles
across
the
common
to
stephen
farm
and
it
took
the
boy
nearly
an
hour
because
the
ground
was
uneven
and
there
were
walls
to
climb
and
also
because
he
was
thinking
of
what
his
grandfather
had
said
would
his
father
one
day
be
old
and
silly
like
his
grandfather
did
every
one
get
old
and
silly
like
that
and
if
so
what
was
the
use
of
being
born
at
all
but
what
happened
to
all
his
father
strength
where
did
it
all
go
to
in
some
curious
undefined
way
he
resented
his
grandfather
remarks
he
could
have
loved
and
admired
his
father
immensely
had
he
been
allowed
to
but
even
if
that
were
not
permitted
he
could
stand
up
for
him
when
he
was
attacked
what
right
had
his
silly
old
grandfather
to
talk
like
that
his
father
would
one
day
be
old
and
stephen
would
he
be
old
too
did
all
strength
go
peter
was
crossing
a
ploughed
field
and
the
rich
brown
earth
heaved
in
a
great
circle
against
the
sky
and
in
the
depth
of
its
furrows
there
were
mysterious
velvet
shadows
the
brown
hedges
stood
back
against
the
sky
line
the
world
was
so
fresh
and
clean
and
strong
this
morning
that
the
figure
and
voice
of
his
grandfather
hung
unpleasantly
about
him
and
depressed
him
there
were
so
many
things
that
he
wanted
to
know
and
so
few
people
to
tell
him
and
he
turned
through
the
white
gates
of
stephen
farm
with
a
consciousness
that
since
christmas
eve
the
world
had
begun
to
be
a
new
place
stephen
was
sitting
in
the
upstairs
room
scratching
his
head
over
his
accounts
whilst
his
old
mother
sat
dozing
with
her
knitting
fallen
on
to
her
lap
by
the
fire
the
window
was
open
and
all
the
sound
and
smells
of
the
farm
came
into
the
room
the
room
was
an
old
one
with
brown
oaken
rafters
and
whitewashed
walls
a
long
oaken
table
down
the
middle
of
it
and
a
view
over
the
farmyard
and
the
sweeping
fields
beyond
it
lost
at
last
in
the
distant
purple
hills
peter
was
given
a
chair
opposite
the
old
lady
who
was
nearly
eighty
and
wore
a
beautiful
white
cap
and
she
woke
up
and
talked
incessantly
because
she
was
very
garrulous
by
nature
and
did
care
in
the
least
to
whom
she
talked
peter
politely
listened
to
what
she
had
to
say
although
he
understood
little
of
it
and
his
eyes
were
watching
for
the
moment
when
the
accounts
should
be
finished
and
stephen
free
ay
said
the
old
lady
and
it
were
good
tenement
were
the
rector
in
those
days
i
remember
and
he
gave
us
a
roaring
discourse
many
the
sunday
church
is
not
what
it
was
with
all
this
singing
and
what
not
and
the
clothes
the
young
women
wear
i
remember
but
stephen
had
closed
his
books
with
a
bang
and
given
his
figures
up
in
despair
i
do
know
how
it
is
boy
he
said
but
they
at
something
different
every
time
yer
look
at
they
one
too
many
for
me
that
one
of
stephen
eyes
was
still
nearly
closed
and
both
eyes
were
black
and
blue
and
his
right
cheek
had
a
bad
bruise
on
it
but
peter
thought
it
was
wiser
not
to
allude
to
the
encounter
the
farm
was
exceedingly
interesting
and
then
there
was
dinner
and
it
was
not
until
the
meal
had
been
cleared
away
that
peter
remembered
that
he
wanted
to
ask
some
questions
and
then
stephen
interrupted
him
with
like
to
go
to
zachary
tan
with
me
this
afternoon
boy
i
got
to
be
lookin
peter
jumped
to
his
feet
with
excitement
oh
steve
this
afternoon
this
afternoon
it
was
the
most
exciting
thing
possible
zachary
tan
was
the
curiosity
shop
of
treliss
and
famous
even
twenty
years
ago
throughout
the
south
country
it
is
still
there
i
believe
although
zachary
himself
is
dead
and
with
him
has
departed
most
of
the
atmosphere
of
the
place
and
it
is
now
smart
and
prosperous
although
in
those
days
it
was
dark
and
dingy
enough
no
one
knew
whence
zachary
had
come
and
he
was
one
of
the
mysteries
of
a
place
that
deals
even
now
in
mysteries
he
had
arrived
as
a
young
man
with
a
basket
over
his
back
thirty
years
before
peter
saw
the
light
when
treliss
was
a
little
fishing
village
and
bannister
junior
had
not
cast
his
enterprising
eye
over
the
man
at
arms
zachary
had
beads
and
silks
and
little
silver
images
in
his
basket
and
he
had
stayed
there
in
a
little
room
over
the
shop
and
things
had
prospered
with
him
the
inhabitants
of
the
place
had
never
trusted
him
but
they
were
always
interested
thiccy
zachary
be
a
poor
trade
they
had
said
at
first
poor
trade
signifying
anything
or
anybody
not
entirely
approved
of
but
they
had
hung
about
his
shop
had
bought
his
silks
and
little
ornaments
and
had
talked
to
him
sometimes
with
eyes
open
and
mouth
agape
at
the
things
that
he
could
tell
them
and
then
people
had
come
from
truro
and
pendragon
and
even
bodmin
and
finally
exeter
because
they
had
heard
of
the
things
that
he
had
for
sale
no
one
knew
where
he
found
his
treasures
for
he
was
always
in
his
shop
smiling
and
amiable
but
sometimes
gentlemen
would
come
from
london
and
he
had
strange
friends
like
andreas
morelli
concerning
whose
life
a
book
has
already
been
written
zachary
tan
shop
became
at
last
the
word
in
treliss
for
all
that
was
strange
and
unusual
the
strongest
link
with
london
and
other
curious
places
he
had
a
little
back
room
behind
his
shop
where
he
would
welcome
his
friends
give
them
something
to
drink
and
talk
about
the
world
he
was
always
so
friendly
that
people
thought
that
he
must
wish
for
things
in
return
but
he
never
asked
for
anything
nor
did
he
speak
about
himself
at
all
as
for
his
portrait
he
had
a
pale
face
a
big
beak
nose
very
black
hair
that
hung
over
his
forehead
and
was
always
untidy
a
blue
velvet
jacket
black
trousers
green
slippers
and
small
feet
he
also
wore
two
rings
and
blew
his
long
nose
in
silk
handkerchiefs
of
the
most
wonderful
colours
all
these
things
may
seem
of
the
slenderest
importance
but
they
are
not
insignificant
if
one
considers
their
effect
upon
peter
zachary
was
the
most
romantic
figure
that
he
had
yet
encountered
to
walk
through
the
shop
with
its
gold
and
its
silver
its
dust
and
its
jewels
into
the
dark
little
room
beyond
to
hear
this
wonderful
person
talk
to
meet
men
who
lived
in
london
to
listen
by
the
light
of
flickering
candles
and
with
one
eyes
fixed
upon
portraits
of
ladies
dancing
in
the
slenderest
attire
this
was
indeed
life
and
life
such
as
the
bending
mule
scaw
house
and
even
stephen
farm
itself
could
not
offer
peter
often
wondered
why
stephen
and
zachary
were
friends
because
they
seemed
to
have
little
enough
in
common
but
stephen
was
a
silent
man
who
liked
all
kinds
of
company
and
peter
noticed
that
zachary
was
always
very
polite
and
obliging
to
stephen
stephen
was
very
silent
going
across
the
common
and
down
the
high
road
into
the
town
but
peter
knew
him
too
well
by
this
time
to
interrupt
his
thoughts
he
was
thinking
perhaps
about
his
accounts
that
would
not
come
right
or
about
the
fight
and
burstead
his
enemy
everybody
had
their
troubles
that
they
thought
about
and
every
one
had
their
secrets
the
things
that
they
kept
to
themselves
even
aunt
jessie
and
old
curtis
the
gardener
one
must
either
be
as
clever
as
zachary
tan
or
as
foolish
as
dicky
the
idiot
to
know
very
much
about
people
zachary
peter
had
noticed
was
one
of
the
persons
who
always
listened
to
everything
that
dicky
had
to
say
and
treated
him
with
the
greatest
seriousness
even
when
he
seemed
to
be
talking
about
the
wildest
things
and
it
was
a
great
many
years
after
this
that
peter
discovered
that
it
was
only
the
wisest
people
who
knew
how
very
important
fools
were
zachary
shop
was
at
the
very
bottom
of
poppero
street
the
steep
and
cobbled
street
that
goes
straight
down
to
the
little
wooden
jetty
where
the
fishing
boats
lie
and
you
could
see
the
sea
like
a
square
handkerchief
between
the
houses
on
either
side
many
of
the
houses
in
poppero
street
are
built
a
little
below
the
level
of
the
pathway
and
you
must
go
down
steps
to
reach
the
door
zachary
shop
was
like
this
and
it
had
a
green
door
with
a
bright
brass
knocker
there
were
always
many
things
jumbled
together
in
the
window
candlesticks
china
shepherds
and
shepherdesses
rings
and
necklaces
cups
and
saucers
little
brass
figures
coins
charms
and
old
blue
china
plates
and
at
the
back
a
complete
suit
of
armour
that
had
been
there
ever
since
zachary
had
first
opened
his
shop
of
course
inside
there
were
a
thousand
and
one
things
of
the
most
exciting
kind
but
stephen
an
enormous
figure
in
the
shop
brushed
past
the
youth
whom
zachary
now
hired
to
assist
with
the
customers
and
passed
into
the
dark
room
beyond
peter
close
at
his
heels
there
were
two
silver
candlesticks
lighted
on
the
mantelpiece
and
there
were
two
more
in
the
centre
of
the
green
baize
table
and
round
the
fire
were
seated
four
men
one
of
them
zachary
himself
another
was
pleasant
little
bannister
host
of
the
man
at
arms
another
was
old
frosted
moses
sucking
as
usual
at
his
great
pipe
and
the
fourth
was
a
stranger
zachary
rose
and
came
forward
smiling
ah
brant
delighted
to
see
you
i
sure
brought
the
boy
with
you
excellent
excellent
bannister
and
tathero
old
moses
society
name
you
know
of
course
this
is
emilio
zanti
a
friend
of
mine
from
the
stranger
who
was
an
enormous
fat
man
with
a
bald
head
and
an
eager
smile
rose
and
shook
hands
with
stephen
he
also
shook
hands
with
peter
as
though
it
had
been
the
ambition
of
his
life
to
meet
that
small
and
rather
defiant
person
he
also
embarrassed
peter
very
much
by
addressing
him
as
though
he
were
grown
up
and
listening
courteously
to
everything
that
he
had
to
say
peter
decided
that
he
did
not
like
him
but
a
gentleman
from
london
was
always
an
exciting
introduction
the
boy
was
able
very
quickly
to
obliterate
himself
by
sitting
down
somewhere
in
a
corner
and
remaining
absolutely
silent
and
perhaps
that
was
the
reason
that
he
was
admitted
to
so
many
elderly
gatherings
he
was
never
in
the
way
he
slipped
quickly
into
a
chair
hidden
in
the
shadow
of
the
wall
but
close
to
the
elbow
of
the
gentleman
from
london
whose
face
he
watched
with
the
greatest
curiosity
stephen
was
silent
and
frosted
moses
very
rarely
said
anything
at
all
so
that
the
conversation
speedily
became
a
dialogue
between
zachary
and
the
foreign
gentleman
with
occasional
appeals
to
brant
for
his
unbiassed
opinion
peter
whole
memory
of
the
incident
was
vague
and
uncertain
although
in
after
years
he
often
tried
very
hard
to
recall
it
all
to
mind
he
was
excited
by
the
mere
atmosphere
of
the
place
by
the
silver
candlesticks
the
dancing
ladies
on
the
walls
zachary
blue
coat
and
the
sense
of
all
the
wonderful
things
in
the
shop
beyond
he
had
no
instinct
that
it
was
all
important
beyond
the
knowledge
that
it
roused
a
great
many
things
in
him
that
the
rest
of
his
life
left
untouched
and
anything
to
do
with
london
a
city
as
he
knew
from
tom
jones
and
david
copperfield
of
extraordinary
excitement
and
adventure
was
an
event
he
watched
emilio
zanti
closely
and
he
decided
that
his
smile
was
not
real
and
that
it
must
be
very
unpleasant
to
have
a
bald
head
he
also
noticed
that
he
said
things
in
a
funny
way
like
ze
beautiful
country
zat
you
with
its
sea
and
its
woods
and
i
the
greatest
for
ze
englishman
also
his
hands
were
very
fat
and
he
wore
rings
like
zachary
sometimes
peter
fancied
that
his
words
meant
a
great
deal
more
than
they
seemed
to
mean
he
laughed
when
there
was
really
nothing
to
laugh
at
and
he
tried
to
make
stephen
talk
but
stephen
was
very
silent
on
the
whole
the
conversation
was
dull
peter
thought
and
once
he
nodded
and
was
very
nearly
asleep
and
fancied
that
the
gentleman
from
london
was
spreading
like
a
balloon
and
filling
all
the
room
there
was
no
mention
of
london
at
all
peter
wondered
for
what
purpose
stephen
had
come
there
because
he
sat
looking
at
the
fire
with
his
brown
hands
spread
out
over
his
great
knees
thinking
apparently
all
his
own
thoughts
then
suddenly
there
came
a
moment
the
london
gentleman
emilio
zanti
turned
round
quite
quickly
and
said
like
a
shot
out
of
a
gun
and
what
does
our
little
friend
think
of
it
peter
did
not
know
to
what
he
was
referring
and
looked
embarrassed
he
was
also
conscious
that
zachary
was
watching
him
keenly
ah
does
not
understand
our
little
friend
but
with
life
what
is
it
that
you
will
do
when
you
are
grown
up
my
boy
and
he
put
his
fat
hand
on
peter
knee
peter
disliked
him
more
than
ever
but
he
answered
i
do
know
i
have
settled
ah
it
is
early
days
said
zanti
nodding
his
head
there
is
much
time
of
course
but
what
is
the
thing
that
our
little
friend
would
care
most
of
all
to
do
to
go
to
school
said
peter
without
any
hesitation
and
both
zachary
and
zanti
laughed
a
great
deal
more
than
was
in
the
least
necessary
and
then
afterwards
said
zanti
to
go
to
london
said
peter
stiffly
feeling
in
some
undefined
way
that
they
were
laughing
at
him
and
that
something
was
going
on
that
he
did
not
understand
ho
that
is
good
said
emilio
slapping
his
knees
and
rocking
in
his
chair
with
merriment
ho
that
is
very
good
he
knows
a
thing
or
two
our
young
friend
here
ho
yes
do
you
mistake
for
a
little
while
he
could
not
speak
for
laughing
and
the
tears
rolled
down
his
fat
cheeks
and
what
is
it
that
you
will
do
when
you
are
there
my
friend
he
said
at
last
i
will
have
adventures
said
peter
growing
a
little
bolder
at
the
thought
of
london
and
its
golden
streets
and
then
suddenly
when
he
heard
this
curious
zanti
grew
very
grave
indeed
and
his
eyes
were
very
large
and
he
put
a
finger
mysteriously
to
his
nose
then
he
leant
right
over
peter
and
almost
whispered
in
his
ear
and
you
shall
of
course
you
shall
you
shall
come
to
london
and
adventures
and
and
oh
yes
bless
my
soul
he
tan
dear
me
yes
london
my
young
friend
is
the
most
wonderful
place
in
one
week
if
you
are
clever
you
made
thousands
of
pounds
thousands
and
thousands
is
it
not
so
tan
when
you
are
just
a
little
bit
older
a
few
years
then
you
shall
come
and
you
ask
for
your
friend
emilio
zanti
because
i
like
you
we
will
be
friends
is
not
that
so
and
he
held
out
his
large
fat
hand
and
grasped
peter
small
and
rather
damp
one
then
he
bent
even
closer
still
holding
peter
hand
do
you
know
one
thing
he
whispered
no
replied
peter
husky
with
awe
it
is
this
that
when
you
think
of
zanti
and
of
london
and
of
adventures
you
will
look
in
a
any
and
you
will
see
what
you
will
see
and
he
nodded
all
over
his
fat
face
peter
was
entirely
overcome
by
this
last
astonishing
statement
and
was
very
relieved
to
hear
numbers
of
clocks
in
the
curiosity
shop
strike
five
he
got
off
his
chair
said
very
politely
indeed
and
hurried
up
the
dark
street
for
the
moment
even
his
beloved
stephen
was
forgotten
and
the
face
of
emilio
zanti
london
streets
and
zachary
silver
candlesticks
were
mingled
confusedly
in
his
brain
iii
and
indeed
throughout
the
dreary
supper
peter
brain
was
in
a
whirl
it
often
happened
that
supper
passed
without
a
word
of
conversation
from
first
to
last
his
father
very
rarely
said
anything
peter
never
said
anything
at
all
and
if
aunt
jessie
did
venture
on
a
little
conversation
she
received
so
slender
an
encouragement
that
she
always
forsook
the
attempt
after
a
very
short
time
it
was
a
miserable
meal
it
was
cold
beef
and
beetroot
and
with
a
very
very
little
strawberry
jam
round
the
edges
of
the
glass
dish
and
there
was
a
hard
red
cheese
and
little
stiff
woolly
biscuits
but
old
grandfather
westcott
was
always
hungry
and
his
querulous
complaints
were
as
regular
an
accompaniment
to
the
evening
meal
as
the
ticking
of
the
marble
clock
but
his
beef
had
to
be
cut
up
for
him
into
very
tiny
pieces
and
that
gave
aunt
jessie
a
great
deal
of
work
so
that
his
appeals
for
a
second
helping
were
considered
abominable
selfishness
oh
my
dear
just
a
leetle
piece
of
beef
this
from
the
very
heart
of
the
cushions
just
the
leetlest
piece
of
beef
for
a
poor
old
man
such
a
leetle
piece
he
had
and
he
had
such
a
no
answer
to
this
and
at
last
a
strange
noise
from
the
cushions
like
the
sound
of
dogs
quarrelling
at
last
again
oh
just
the
leetlest
piece
of
beef
for
a
poor
old
man
and
then
whimpering
and
poor
old
man
repeated
at
intervals
that
lengthened
gradually
into
sleep
at
last
the
meal
was
over
the
things
had
been
cleared
away
and
peter
was
bending
over
a
sum
in
preparation
for
lessons
on
monday
such
a
sum
add
this
and
this
and
this
and
this
and
then
divide
it
by
that
and
multiply
the
result
by
this
and
the
figures
bad
figures
crept
over
the
page
and
there
were
smudgy
finger
marks
and
always
between
every
other
line
london
and
fat
zanti
laughing
until
the
tears
ran
down
his
such
a
strange
world
where
all
these
things
could
be
so
curiously
confused
all
of
them
one
supposed
having
their
purpose
and
meaning
even
grandfather
and
even
x
x
and
ever
so
many
more
until
they
ran
races
round
the
page
and
up
and
down
and
in
and
out
and
then
suddenly
into
the
middle
of
the
silence
his
father
voice
what
are
you
doing
there
sums
father
for
you
wo
go
back
on
monday
and
this
without
the
moving
an
inch
not
go
back
no
you
are
going
away
to
school
to
devonshire
on
tuesday
and
peter
pencil
fell
clattering
on
to
the
paper
and
the
answer
to
that
sum
is
still
an
open
question
chapter
iv
in
which
dawson
as
the
gate
of
life
is
proved
a
disappointment
i
it
was
of
course
very
strange
that
this
should
come
so
swiftly
after
the
meeting
with
the
london
gentleman
it
was
almost
as
though
he
had
known
about
it
because
it
was
a
first
step
towards
that
london
that
he
had
so
confidently
promised
to
peter
school
meant
the
immediate
supply
of
the
two
things
that
he
wanted
more
than
anything
in
the
world
friendship
and
knowledge
not
knowledge
of
the
tiresome
kind
knowledge
that
had
to
do
with
the
kings
of
israel
and
the
capital
of
italy
but
rather
the
experience
that
other
gentlemen
of
his
own
age
had
already
gathered
during
their
journey
through
the
world
stephen
zachary
moses
dicky
trussit
old
curtis
even
aunt
jessie
all
these
people
had
knowledge
of
course
but
they
would
not
give
it
you
they
would
not
talk
to
you
as
though
they
were
at
your
stage
of
the
journey
they
could
not
exchange
opinions
with
you
they
could
not
share
in
your
wild
surmises
they
could
not
sympathise
with
your
hatred
of
addition
multiplication
and
subtraction
the
fellow
victims
at
old
parlow
might
have
been
expected
to
do
these
things
but
they
were
too
young
too
uninterested
too
unenterprising
one
wanted
real
boys
boys
with
excitement
and
sympathy
boys
he
had
wanted
it
far
far
more
terribly
than
any
one
had
known
he
had
sat
sometimes
in
the
dark
in
his
bedroom
and
thought
about
it
until
he
had
very
nearly
cried
because
he
wanted
it
so
badly
and
now
it
had
suddenly
come
out
of
the
clouds
bang
ii
that
last
week
went
with
a
rattling
speed
and
provided
a
number
of
most
interesting
situations
in
the
first
place
there
was
the
joy
a
simple
but
delightful
one
on
monday
morning
of
thinking
of
those
others
who
were
entering
with
laggard
foot
into
old
parlow
study
that
study
with
the
shining
map
of
europe
on
the
wall
a
bust
of
julius
cæsar
conquered
britain
and
the
worn
red
carpet
they
would
all
be
there
they
would
wonder
where
he
was
and
on
discovering
that
he
would
never
come
again
willie
daffoll
of
recent
tragic
memory
would
be
pleased
because
now
he
would
be
chief
and
leader
well
let
him
yes
that
was
all
very
pleasant
to
think
of
there
was
further
the
thought
that
school
might
not
after
all
be
exactly
what
peter
imagined
it
the
pictures
in
his
mind
were
evolved
from
his
reading
of
david
there
would
be
people
like
steerforth
and
dear
traddles
there
would
be
a
master
who
played
the
flute
there
would
be
rebellions
and
riots
would
there
trussit
was
of
little
value
on
this
occasion
mrs
trussit
were
you
ever
at
school
no
master
peter
i
was
never
at
school
my
good
mother
who
died
at
the
ripe
old
age
of
with
all
her
faculties
gave
me
a
liberal
and
handsome
education
with
her
own
do
you
think
it
will
be
like
copperfield
trussit
was
ignorant
of
the
work
in
question
of
course
master
peter
how
can
you
ask
such
a
thing
they
are
all
like
that
i
believe
but
there
run
away
now
it
time
for
me
to
be
looking
after
your
mother
supper
trussit
obviously
knew
nothing
whatever
about
it
although
peter
heard
her
once
murmuring
poor
lamb
as
she
gave
him
mixed
biscuits
out
of
her
tin
stephen
also
was
of
little
use
and
he
did
seem
especially
glad
when
he
heard
about
it
and
it
a
good
school
do
you
think
he
said
of
course
said
peter
valiantly
one
of
the
very
best
in
devonshire
and
i
leave
by
the
eight
train
this
very
importantly
the
fact
of
the
matter
was
that
peter
was
so
greatly
excited
by
it
all
that
abandoning
even
stephen
was
a
minor
sorrow
it
was
a
dreadful
pity
of
course
but
peter
intended
to
write
most
wonderful
letters
and
there
would
be
the
joyful
meeting
when
the
holidays
came
round
and
he
would
be
a
more
sensible
person
for
stephen
to
have
for
a
friend
after
seen
the
world
dear
stephen
i
shall
write
every
week
every
friday
i
expect
that
will
be
a
good
day
to
yes
that
be
a
good
day
well
the
end
of
yer
as
yer
are
it
be
another
peter
coming
back
maybe
up
along
they
change
but
never
me
and
you
steve
i
shall
love
you
the
man
seized
him
almost
fiercely
by
the
shoulders
and
looked
him
in
the
face
promise
me
that
boy
he
said
promise
me
that
yer
most
all
i
got
now
but
i
a
fool
to
ask
yer
of
course
yer
change
i
an
ignorant
they
were
standing
in
the
middle
of
one
of
stephen
brown
ploughed
fields
and
the
cold
sharp
day
was
drawing
to
a
close
as
the
mist
stole
up
from
the
ground
and
the
dim
sun
sank
behind
the
hedgerows
peter
in
the
school
years
that
followed
always
had
this
picture
of
stephen
standing
in
the
middle
of
his
field
stephen
rough
red
brown
clothes
his
beard
that
curled
a
little
his
brown
corduroys
that
smelt
of
sheep
and
hay
the
shining
brass
buttons
of
his
coat
his
broad
back
and
large
brown
hands
his
mild
blue
eyes
and
nose
suddenly
square
at
the
end
where
it
ought
to
have
been
round
this
stephen
brant
raised
from
the
very
heart
of
the
land
something
as
strong
and
primitive
as
the
oaks
and
corn
and
running
stream
that
made
his
background
stephen
suddenly
caught
up
peter
and
kissed
him
so
that
the
boy
cried
out
then
he
turned
abruptly
and
left
him
and
peter
did
not
see
him
again
he
said
his
farewells
to
the
town
tenderly
and
gravely
the
cobbled
streets
the
dear
and
the
tower
the
bending
mule
here
there
were
farewells
to
be
said
to
and
figgis
and
old
moses
the
wooden
jetty
and
the
then
the
beach
and
the
caves
and
the
sea
last
of
all
the
grey
hill
peter
climbed
it
on
the
last
afternoon
of
all
he
was
quite
alone
and
the
world
was
very
still
he
could
not
hear
the
sea
at
all
at
last
he
was
at
the
top
and
leant
his
back
against
the
giant
finger
looking
round
there
are
the
hills
that
guard
truro
there
are
the
woods
where
the
rabbits
are
there
is
the
sea
and
a
wonderful
view
of
treliss
rising
into
a
peak
which
is
the
man
at
arms
and
the
smoke
of
the
town
mingled
with
the
grey
uncertain
clouds
and
the
clouds
mingled
with
the
sea
and
the
only
certain
and
assured
thing
was
the
strength
of
the
giant
finger
that
at
least
he
could
feel
cold
and
hard
against
his
hands
he
felt
curiously
solemn
and
grave
and
even
a
little
tearful
and
he
stole
down
through
the
dusk
softly
as
though
his
finger
were
on
his
lips
and
then
after
this
a
multitude
of
hurrying
sensations
with
their
climax
in
a
very
very
early
morning
when
one
dressed
with
a
candle
when
one
box
was
corded
and
one
attic
looked
strangely
bare
when
there
was
a
surprising
amount
to
eat
at
breakfast
when
one
stole
downstairs
softly
he
had
said
to
his
mother
on
the
previous
evening
and
she
had
kissed
him
and
he
had
felt
uncomfortable
and
shy
then
there
were
trussit
and
his
aunt
to
see
him
off
there
was
a
cab
and
most
wonderful
of
all
there
was
his
father
coming
in
the
cab
that
was
a
dreadful
thing
and
the
journey
to
the
station
seemed
endless
because
of
it
his
father
was
perfectly
silent
and
any
thrill
that
peter
might
have
snatched
from
the
engines
the
porters
the
whistles
and
his
own
especial
carriage
were
negatived
by
this
paralysing
occurrence
he
would
have
liked
to
have
said
something
himself
but
he
could
only
think
of
things
that
were
quite
impossible
like
how
funny
trussit
nose
is
early
in
the
morning
i
wonder
what
old
parlow
it
was
terrible
he
was
in
his
carriage
they
were
hurrying
every
one
was
hurrying
his
father
suddenly
spoke
the
guard
will
see
to
you
you
change
at
exeter
your
aunt
has
given
you
a
little
pause
and
then
you
got
pluck
you
stood
that
beating
then
the
stern
face
passed
and
the
grave
awful
figure
faded
slowly
down
the
platform
peter
felt
suddenly
utterly
completely
miserable
and
alone
two
tears
rolled
slowly
down
his
cheeks
he
blew
his
nose
and
the
train
started
iii
and
so
this
first
run
into
liberty
begins
with
tears
and
a
choke
in
the
throat
and
a
sudden
panting
desire
to
be
back
in
the
dark
passages
of
scaw
house
nor
did
the
fleeting
swiftness
of
the
new
country
please
him
suddenly
one
was
leaving
behind
all
those
known
paths
and
views
so
dimly
commonplace
in
the
having
of
them
so
rosily
romantic
in
the
tragic
wanting
of
them
how
curious
that
trussit
his
aunt
and
his
father
should
appear
now
pathetically
affectionate
in
their
farewells
of
him
they
were
not
to
that
he
could
swear
and
yet
back
he
would
run
did
honour
and
destiny
allow
him
above
all
how
he
would
have
run
now
to
stephen
he
felt
like
a
sharp
wound
the
horrible
selfishness
and
indifference
of
his
parting
when
stephen
beard
had
been
pressed
so
roughly
against
his
face
that
it
had
hurt
him
and
he
had
had
nothing
to
say
he
would
write
that
very
night
if
they
the
unknown
gods
to
whose
kingdom
he
journeyed
would
allow
him
this
comforted
him
a
little
and
the
spirit
of
adventure
stirred
in
him
anew
he
wiped
his
eyes
for
the
last
time
with
the
crumpled
ball
of
his
handkerchief
sniffed
three
times
defiantly
and
settled
to
a
summary
of
the
passing
country
cows
and
hills
and
hedges
presently
the
pleasing
bustle
of
truro
station
and
then
again
the
cows
and
hills
and
hedges
on
parting
from
cornwall
he
discovered
a
new
sensation
and
was
surprised
that
he
should
feel
it
he
did
not
know
as
a
definite
fact
the
exact
moment
when
that
merging
of
cornwall
into
devon
came
and
yet
strangely
in
his
spirit
he
was
conscious
of
it
now
he
was
in
a
foreign
country
and
it
was
almost
as
though
his
own
land
had
cast
him
out
so
that
the
sharp
appealing
farewell
to
the
grey
hill
treliss
and
the
sea
was
even
more
poignant
than
his
farewell
to
his
friends
had
been
once
more
at
the
thought
of
all
the
ways
that
he
loved
cornwall
the
choking
sob
was
in
his
throat
and
the
hot
tears
were
in
his
eyes
and
his
hands
were
clenched
and
then
he
remembered
that
london
was
not
in
cornwall
and
if
he
were
ever
going
to
get
there
at
all
he
must
not
mind
this
parting
what
the
devil
are
you
crying
about
came
suddenly
from
the
other
side
of
the
carriage
he
looked
up
and
saw
that
there
was
an
old
gentleman
sitting
in
the
opposite
corner
he
had
a
red
fat
face
and
beautiful
white
hair
i
not
crying
said
peter
rather
defiantly
oh
yes
you
are
or
you
were
supposing
you
share
my
lunch
and
see
whether
that
will
make
things
any
thank
you
very
much
but
i
have
some
sandwiches
said
peter
feeling
for
the
paper
packet
and
finding
it
well
supposing
you
come
over
here
and
eat
yours
with
me
and
if
you
could
manage
to
help
me
with
any
of
mine
i
should
be
greatly
indebted
i
ca
bear
having
my
meals
alone
you
how
can
one
possibly
resist
it
when
the
olympians
come
down
so
amiably
from
their
heights
and
offer
us
their
hospitality
moreover
the
old
gentleman
had
from
his
bag
produced
the
most
wonderfully
shaped
parcels
there
was
certainly
a
meal
and
aunt
jessie
sandwiches
would
assuredly
be
thick
and
probably
no
mustard
so
peter
slipped
across
and
sat
next
to
the
old
gentleman
and
even
shared
a
rug
he
ultimately
shared
a
great
many
other
things
like
chicken
and
tongue
apples
and
pears
and
plum
cake
of
course
said
the
old
gentleman
you
are
going
to
school
and
probably
for
the
first
time
and
therefore
your
legs
are
as
weak
as
pins
you
have
a
cold
pain
in
the
middle
of
your
chest
and
you
have
an
intense
desire
to
see
your
mother
peter
admitted
that
this
was
true
although
it
was
his
mother
whom
he
wished
to
see
so
much
as
a
friend
of
his
called
stephen
and
one
or
two
places
like
the
grey
hill
and
the
bending
mule
all
this
interested
the
old
gentleman
very
much
you
too
were
at
school
peter
inquired
politely
i
was
said
the
old
gentleman
and
was
it
like
david
copperfield
said
peter
parts
of
it
the
nice
parts
school
was
the
best
the
very
best
time
of
my
life
my
boy
and
so
you
find
this
was
immensely
reassuring
and
peter
felt
very
much
cheered
you
will
make
all
the
friends
of
your
life
there
you
will
learn
to
be
a
man
dear
me
the
old
gentleman
coughed
i
do
know
what
i
would
have
done
without
school
you
must
have
courage
you
know
he
added
i
heard
some
one
say
once
said
peter
that
courage
is
the
most
important
thing
to
have
it
is
life
that
matters
but
courage
this
man
bless
my
soul
the
old
gentleman
said
how
old
are
you
boy
twelve
nearly
thirteen
answered
peter
well
the
more
you
see
of
boys
the
better
you
might
be
forty
by
the
way
you
talk
you
want
games
and
fellows
of
your
own
age
that
what
you
want
why
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
talking
about
life
at
your
peter
felt
that
he
had
done
something
very
wrong
although
he
had
the
least
idea
of
his
crime
so
he
turned
the
conversation
i
should
like
very
much
he
said
to
hear
about
your
school
if
you
would
then
the
old
gentleman
began
in
the
most
wonderful
way
and
to
hear
him
talk
you
would
imagine
that
school
was
the
paradise
to
which
all
good
boys
were
sent
a
deliriously
delightful
place
with
a
shop
full
of
sweets
games
without
end
friends
galore
and
a
little
work
now
and
then
to
prevent
one
being
bored
peter
listened
most
attentively
with
his
head
against
the
old
gentleman
very
warm
coat
and
then
the
warmth
and
the
movement
of
the
train
caused
the
voice
to
swim
further
and
further
away
into
distance
bless
my
soul
peter
heard
as
though
it
had
been
whispered
at
the
end
of
the
train
here
exeter
young
man
your
father
said
you
were
to
change
a
rubbing
of
eyes
and
behold
a
stout
guard
in
front
of
the
door
and
no
sign
of
the
old
gentleman
whatever
but
when
he
felt
for
his
ticket
in
his
side
pocket
he
found
also
a
glittering
sovereign
that
had
certainly
not
been
there
when
he
went
asleep
all
this
was
very
encouraging
and
peter
followed
the
guard
across
the
exeter
platform
hopefully
and
expectantly
right
down
the
platform
on
a
side
line
was
a
little
train
that
reminded
peter
of
the
treliss
to
truro
one
so
helpless
and
incapable
did
it
look
the
guard
put
him
and
his
luggage
into
a
carriage
and
then
left
him
with
a
last
word
as
to
salton
being
his
destination
he
waited
here
a
very
long
time
and
nothing
happened
he
must
have
slept
again
because
when
he
next
looked
out
of
the
window
the
platform
was
full
of
people
he
realised
with
terror
that
they
were
many
of
them
boys
boys
with
friends
and
boys
without
he
watched
them
with
a
great
feeling
of
desolation
and
homesickness
as
they
flung
themselves
into
carriages
and
shouted
at
one
another
a
small
boy
with
a
very
red
face
and
a
round
fat
body
attended
by
a
tall
thin
lady
in
black
got
into
the
carriage
and
behaving
as
if
peter
were
there
at
all
leaned
out
of
the
window
all
right
mater
that
all
right
i
tell
about
the
socks
old
mother
gill
will
look
after
you
wo
forget
to
send
me
a
post
card
will
dear
will
you
no
mater
that
all
right
i
say
do
you
bother
to
wait
if
you
want
to
be
no
dear
i
like
to
wait
do
forget
to
give
father
letter
to
all
right
i
say
it
rotten
for
you
waiting
about
really
give
my
love
to
floss
well
perhaps
i
had
better
go
this
train
seems
to
be
late
dearest
an
interval
during
which
the
stout
boy
leaned
out
of
the
window
and
was
embraced
soon
his
bowler
hat
was
flung
wildly
on
to
the
rack
and
he
was
leaning
out
of
the
window
screaming
cocker
i
say
cocker
cocker
oh
dash
it
he
going
in
there
cocker
cocker
hullo
bisket
going
strong
cocker
oh
there
he
is
hullo
old
man
thought
i
should
miss
you
come
on
in
here
thought
never
get
rid
of
the
mater
they
do
hang
about
a
small
boy
with
his
hat
on
one
side
got
into
the
carriage
stepped
on
peter
feet
without
apologising
and
then
the
two
gentlemen
sat
down
at
the
other
end
of
the
carriage
and
exchanged
experiences
what
sort
of
hols
oh
pretty
rotten
got
nothing
for
christmas
at
all
except
a
measly
knife
or
two
governor
played
it
awfully
low
i
rather
scored
because
my
sister
had
a
ripping
writing
case
sent
to
her
and
i
gave
her
a
rotten
old
book
in
exchange
and
she
jolly
well
had
and
so
it
continued
to
peter
it
was
completely
unintelligible
the
boys
at
old
parlow
had
never
talked
like
this
he
was
suddenly
flung
into
a
foreign
country
the
dismay
in
his
heart
grew
as
he
remembered
that
he
was
going
into
this
life
entirely
alone
and
without
a
friend
in
the
world
he
felt
that
he
would
had
it
been
possible
gladly
have
exchanged
this
dreadful
plunge
for
a
beating
from
his
father
at
any
rate
after
that
there
were
friends
to
whom
one
might
go
after
this
as
the
train
dragged
slowly
and
painfully
along
the
dreariness
and
the
loneliness
increased
the
dusk
fell
and
they
stopped
as
it
seemed
every
other
minute
and
always
peter
thought
that
it
must
be
salton
and
prepared
to
get
out
the
two
boys
in
his
carriage
paid
no
attention
to
him
whatever
and
their
voices
continued
incessantly
and
always
the
little
train
jolted
along
sleepily
wandering
through
the
dark
country
and
carrying
him
to
unknown
terrors
but
he
set
his
teeth
hard
and
remembered
what
the
old
gentleman
had
told
him
he
would
fight
it
out
and
see
it
through
is
life
that
matters
but
the
courage
and
then
suddenly
the
train
stopped
the
two
boys
flung
themselves
at
the
window
and
the
porter
outside
like
a
magician
who
kept
a
rabbit
in
a
bag
suddenly
shouted
salton
after
that
there
were
mixed
impressions
he
stood
alone
on
the
dark
windy
platform
whilst
dark
figures
passed
and
repassed
him
then
a
tall
thin
somebody
said
are
you
westcott
and
peter
said
yes
and
he
was
conveyed
to
a
large
wagonette
already
crowded
with
boys
then
there
was
a
great
deal
of
squeezing
a
great
deal
of
noise
and
some
one
in
authority
said
from
somewhere
less
noise
the
wagonette
started
in
a
jolting
uncertain
way
and
then
they
seemed
to
go
on
for
ever
and
ever
between
dark
hedges
with
black
trees
that
swept
their
heads
and
the
faint
blue
of
the
evening
sky
on
the
horizon
every
one
was
very
quiet
now
and
peter
fell
asleep
once
more
and
dreamed
of
the
old
gentleman
plum
cake
and
stephen
a
sudden
pause
the
sound
of
an
iron
gate
being
swung
back
and
peter
was
awake
again
to
see
that
they
were
driving
up
to
a
dark
heavy
building
that
looked
like
a
hospital
or
a
prison
the
new
boys
please
follow
me
and
he
found
himself
still
struggling
with
sleep
blinded
by
the
sudden
light
following
with
some
ten
others
a
long
and
thin
gentleman
who
wore
a
his
strongest
feeling
was
that
he
was
very
cold
and
that
he
hated
everybody
and
everything
he
heard
many
voices
somewhere
in
the
distance
doors
were
being
continually
opened
and
shut
and
little
winds
blew
down
the
dismal
passages
they
were
suddenly
in
a
study
lined
with
books
and
a
stout
rubicund
gentleman
with
a
gold
watch
chain
and
a
habit
as
peter
at
once
discovered
of
whistling
through
his
teeth
was
writing
at
a
table
he
turned
round
when
he
heard
them
enter
and
watched
them
for
a
moment
as
they
stood
by
the
door
well
boys
his
voice
came
from
somewhere
near
his
watch
chain
come
and
shake
hands
how
are
you
all
some
eager
boy
in
the
front
row
with
a
pleasant
smile
and
a
shrill
piping
voice
said
very
well
thank
you
sir
and
peter
immediately
hated
him
then
they
shook
hands
and
their
names
were
written
in
a
book
the
stout
gentleman
said
well
boys
here
you
all
are
your
first
term
you
know
very
important
work
and
play
work
and
play
work
first
and
play
afterwards
and
then
we
be
friends
oh
yes
supper
at
nine
prayers
at
they
were
all
bundled
out
and
the
tall
man
with
said
now
boys
you
have
an
hour
before
supper
and
left
them
without
another
word
in
a
long
dark
passage
the
passage
was
hung
with
greatcoats
and
down
each
side
of
it
were
at
the
other
end
mistily
and
vaguely
figures
passed
peter
sat
down
on
one
of
the
and
saw
to
his
disgust
that
the
eager
boy
with
the
piping
voice
sat
down
also
i
say
said
the
piping
boy
do
you
like
school

hate

said
peter
oh

say

minute

the
piping

up
from

and
stood

right
you
need
be
ratty
about
it
i
tell
the
fellows
you
said
your
name
was
peter
they
give
it
and
the
piping
boy
moved
down
the
passage
whistling
casually
after
this
silence
and
only
all
the
greatcoats
swaying
a
little
in
the
draught
and
bulging
out
and
then
thinning
again
as
though
there
were
two
persons
inside
them
peter
sat
quite
motionless
for
a
long
time
with
his
face
in
his
hands
he
was
very
tired
and
very
cold
and
very
hungry
a
crowd
advanced
towards
him
five
or
six
boys
and
one
large
fat
boy
was
holding
the
piping
one
by
the
ear
oh
i
say
let
me
go
let
me
go
i
do
your
boots
up
really
i
will
i
do
whatever
you
like
oh
i
say
there
a
new
boy
he
says
his
name
is
peter
so
did
the
wretched
piping
one
endeavour
to
divert
attention
from
his
own
person
the
fat
boy
accompanied
by
a
complacent
satellite
approached
peter
hullo
you
what
your
name
is
it
peter
well
peter
westcott

up
when
you
spoken
to
by
your
betters

peter
was
hacked
up
now
what
do
you
mean
by
not
speaking
when
you
spoken
to
peter
stood
square
and
faced
him
oh
you
wo
speak
wo
you
see
if
this
will
do
peter
arm
and
ear
were
twisted
he
was
also
hit
in
the
mouth
he
was
still
silent
some
one
in
the
back
of
the
crowd
said
oh
come
on
you
chaps
leave
this
kid
the
other
fellow
more
and
they
passed
on
bearing
the
piping
one
with
them
peter
sat
down
again
he
was
feeling
sick
and
his
head
ached
he
buried
his
head
in
the
greatcoat
that
hung
above
him
and
cried
quite
silently
for
a
very
long
time
a
bell
rang
and
boys
ran
past
him
and
he
ran
with
them
he
found
that
it
was
supper
and
that
he
was
sitting
with
the
other
new
boys
at
the
bottom
of
the
table
but
he
could
not
eat
and
his
head
was
swimming
then
there
were
prayers
and
as
he
knelt
on
the
hard
floor
with
his
head
against
the
form
some
one
stuck
a
pin
into
the
soft
part
of
his
leg
and
gave
him
great
pain
then
at
last
and
all
this
time
he
had
spoken
to
no
one
upstairs
to
bed
a
tall
thin
woman
in
shining
black
was
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
she
read
out
to
the
new
boys
the
numbers
of
their
dormitories
in
a
harsh
metallic
voice
peter
went
to
his
and
found
it
a
long
room
with
twenty
beds
twenty
washing
basins
and
twenty
chairs
one
last
incident
he
slept
and
was
dreaming
he
was
climbing
the
grey
hill
and
stephen
was
following
him
calling
on
him
he
remembered
in
his
dream
that
he
had
not
written
stephen
the
letter
that
he
had
promised
and
he
turned
back
down
the
hill
then
suddenly
the
ground
began
to
toss
under
his
feet
he
cried
for
stephen
he
was
flung
into
the
air
he
was
falling
he
woke
and
found
that
he
was
lying
on
the
floor
amongst
the
tumbled
sheets
and
blankets
in
the
distance
he
could
hear
stifled
laughter
the
terror
of
that
awful
wakening
was
still
upon
him
and
he
thought
for
a
moment
that
he
would
die
because
his
heart
would
never
beat
again
then
slowly
he
gathered
his
clothes
together
and
tried
to
arrange
them
on
the
bed
he
was
dreadfully
cold
and
his
toes
stuck
out
at
the
end
of
the
bed
he
could
not
cover
them
but
tired
as
he
was
he
dared
not
fall
asleep
again
lest
there
should
come
once
more
that
dreadful
wakening

i
love
you
very
very
very
much
i
am
very
happy
your
loving
friend
peter
a
letter
from
stephen
to
peter
peter
i
have
thought
every
day
of
you
and
i
was
mighty
glad
to
get
your
bit
of
a
letter
fearing
that
maybe
thiccy
place
in
devon
might
have
driven
your
old
friends
out
of
your
head
i
am
no
hand
with
a
pen
and
it
is
taking
me
a
time
to
write
this
so
i
will
just
say
that
i
right
glad
you
happy
and
that
i
greet
the
day
i
see
you
again
and
it
poor
trade
here
without
you
i
am
always
your
friend
stephen
but
peter
had
lied
in
his
letter
he
was
not
in
any
way
happy
at
all
he
had
lied
because
he
knew
that
it
would
have
hurt
stephen
if
he
had
told
him
the
truth
and
the
truth
was
something
that
must
be
met
with
clenched
teeth
and
shoulders
set
back
taking
him
at
the
end
of
the
first
week
one
finds
simple
bewilderment
and
also
a
conviction
that
silence
is
the
best
policy
he
was
placed
in
the
lowest
form
because
of
his
ignorance
of
latin
and
mathematics
and
here
every
one
was
younger
and
weaker
during
school
hours
there
was
comparative
peace
and
he
sat
with
perplexed
brow
and
inky
fingers
or
was
sent
down
to
the
bottom
for
inattention
it
was
not
inattention
but
rather
a
complete
incapacity
for
grasping
the
system
on
which
everything
worked
meanwhile
in
this
first
week
he
had
earned
a
reputation
and
made
three
friends
and
although
he
did
not
know
it
that
was
not
a
bad
beginning
on
the
day
after
his
arrival
peter
after
midday
dinner
standing
desolately
in
the
playground
and
feeling
certain
that
he
ought
to
be
playing
football
somewhere
but
completely
ignorant
as
to
the
place
where
lists
commonly
hung
saw
another
new
boy
and
hailed
him
this
boy
he
had
noticed
before
he
was
shapeless
of
body
with
big
round
eyes
and
he
moved
more
slowly
than
any
one
whom
peter
had
ever
seen
nothing
stirred
him
he
did
not
mind
it
when
his
ears
were
pulled
or
his
arms
twisted
but
only
said
slowly
oh
drop
it
to
this
wonderful
boy
peter
made
approach
can
you
tell
me
where
the
lists
are
for
football
i
ought
to
have
been
playing
yesterday
only
i
did
know
where
to
the
slow
boy
smiled
i
going
to
look
myself
he
said
come
and
then
two
things
happened
first
sauntering
down
the
playground
there
came
a
boy
whom
peter
had
noticed
on
that
first
morning
in
school
some
one
very
little
older
than
peter
and
not
very
much
bigger
but
with
a
grace
a
dignity
an
air
that
was
very
wonderful
indeed
he
was
a
dark
boy
with
his
hair
carelessly
tossed
over
his
forehead
he
was
very
clean
and
he
had
beautiful
hands
to
peter
rough
and
clumsy
figure
he
seemed
everything
that
a
boy
should
be
and
in
his
mind
he
had
called
him
as
this
boy
approached
there
suddenly
burst
into
view
a
discordant
crowd
with
some
one
in
their
midst
they
were
shouting
and
laughing
and
peter
could
hear
that
some
one
was
crying
the
crowd
separated
and
formed
a
ring
and
danced
shouting
round
a
very
small
and
chubby
boy
who
was
standing
crying
quite
desperately
with
his
head
buried
in
his
arm
every
now
and
then
the
infant
was
knocked
by
one
boy
in
the
ring
into
another
boy
arms
and
so
was
tossed
from
side
to
side
the
hopeless
sound
of
the
chubby
one
crying
caused
peter
suddenly
to
go
red
hot
somewhere
inside
his
chest
and
like
a
bullet
from
a
gun
he
was
into
the
middle
of
the
circle
you
beasts
you
beasts
he
sobbed
hysterically
he
began
to
hit
wildly
with
his
head
down
at
any
one
near
him
and
very
soon
there
was
a
glorious
mêlée
the
crowd
roared
with
laughter
as
they
flung
the
two
small
boys
against
one
another
then
suddenly
one
of
the
circle
got
a
wild
blow
in
the
eye
from
peter
fist
and
went
staggering
back
another
was
kicked
in
the
shins
a
third
was
badly
winded
peter
had
lost
all
sense
of
place
or
time
of
reason
or
sanity
he
was
wild
with
excitement
and
the
emotions
of
the
last
five
days
found
magnificent
overwhelming
freedom
he
did
not
know
whether
he
were
hit
or
no
once
he
was
down
and
in
an
instant
up
again
once
a
face
was
close
to
his
and
he
drove
hard
at
the
mouth
but
he
was
small
and
his
arms
and
legs
were
short
indeed
it
would
have
gone
badly
with
him
had
there
not
been
heard
in
all
the
roar
of
battle
the
mystic
whisper
binns
and
in
an
instant
as
the
snow
flies
before
the
sun
so
had
that
gallant
crowd
disappeared
only
the
small
cause
of
the
disturbance
and
peter
remained
the
tall
form
of
a
master
passed
slowly
down
the
playground
but
it
appeared
that
he
had
seen
nothing
and
he
did
not
speak
the
small
boy
was
gazing
at
peter
with
eyes
large
in
a
white
face
on
which
were
many
tear
stains
peter
who
was
conscious
now
that
blood
was
pouring
from
a
cut
in
his
cheek
that
one
of
his
teeth
was
missing
and
that
one
of
his
eyes
was
fast
closing
was
about
to
speak
to
him
when
he
was
aware
that
his
steerforth
had
sprung
from
nowhere
and
was
advancing
gracefully
to
meet
him
peter
heart
beat
very
fast
the
boy
smiled
at
him
and
held
out
his
hand
i
say
shake
hands
you
got
pluck
my
eye
i
never
saw
such
a
rag
peter
shook
hands
and
was
speechless
what
your
name
mine
cardillac
it
is
spelt
as
it
spoken
you
know
i
in
white
what
do
you
say
to
places
next
each
other
at
table
peter
face
was
crimson
thanks
most
he
stammered
in
his
eagerness
right
you
are
see
you
after
the
boy
moved
away
peter
said
something
to
the
infant
whom
he
had
delivered
and
was
considering
where
he
might
most
unobtrusively
wash
when
he
was
once
more
conscious
of
some
one
at
his
elbow
it
was
the
slow
boy
who
was
smiling
at
him
i
say
you
a
sight
you
better
wash
you
yes
i
was
just
thinking
of
that
only
i
did
quite
know
where
to
come
with
me
i
get
round
mother
gill
all
right
she
likes
me
you
got
some
cheek
prester
and
banks
mi
and
all
sorts
of
fellows
were
in
that
crowd
you
landed
prester
he
chuckled
your
name
mine
galleon
peter
eyes
shone
i
say
you
did
ever
have
a
housekeeper
called
trussit
trussit
yes
rather
of
course
i
remember
when
i
was
awfully
why
she
ours
now
then
it
must
be
your
father
who
writes
books
yes
rather
he
most
awfully
famous
peter
stopped
still
his
mouth
open
with
excitement
of
all
the
amazing
things
what
does
life
give
you
if
you
trust
it
ii
but
before
it
became
a
question
of
individuals
there
is
the
place
to
be
considered
this
dawson
of
twenty
years
ago
does
not
exist
now
nor
let
us
pray
the
fates
are
there
others
like
it
it
is
not
only
with
bitterness
that
a
boy
whom
dawson
had
formed
would
look
back
on
it
but
also
with
a
dim
confused
wonder
that
he
had
escaped
with
a
straight
soul
and
a
straight
body
from
that
place
there
were
many
very
many
indeed
who
did
not
escape
and
it
would
indeed
have
been
better
for
them
all
had
they
died
before
they
were
old
enough
to
test
its
hospitality
if
any
of
those
into
whose
hands
this
story
of
peter
may
fall
were
by
the
design
of
god
themselves
trained
by
the
place
of
which
i
speak
they
will
understand
that
all
were
not
as
fortunate
as
peter
and
for
those
others
there
should
be
sympathy
to
peter
indeed
it
all
came
very
slowly
because
he
had
known
so
little
before
he
had
not
been
a
week
in
the
place
before
there
were
very
many
things
that
he
was
told
there
were
other
things
that
he
saw
for
himself
there
is
for
instance
at
the
end
of
the
third
week
the
incident
of
ferris
the
captain
of
the
school
he
was
as
a
god
in
peter
eyes
he
was
greater
more
wonderful
than
stephen
than
any
one
in
the
world
his
word
was
law
one
late
afternoon
peter
cleaned
plates
for
him
in
his
study
and
ferris
watched
him
ferris
was
kind
and
talked
about
many
things
out
of
his
great
wisdom
and
then
he
asked
peter
whether
he
would
always
like
to
be
his
fag
and
peter
delighted
said
then
ferris
smiled
and
spoke
dropping
his
voice
three
weeks
earlier
peter
would
not
have
understood
but
now
he
understood
quite
well
and
he
went
very
white
and
broke
from
the
room
leaving
the
plates
where
they
were
and
cheeseman
became
ferris
fag
this
was
all
very
puzzling
and
perplexing
to
peter
but
after
that
first
evening
when
he
had
hidden
his
head
in
the
greatcoat
and
cried
he
had
shown
no
sign
of
fear
and
he
soon
found
that
on
that
side
of
life
things
became
easy
he
was
speedily
left
alone
and
indeed
he
must
have
been
in
spite
of
his
small
size
something
of
a
figure
even
then
his
head
was
so
very
firm
on
his
shoulders
his
grey
eyes
were
so
very
straight
and
his
lip
curled
in
a
disagreeable
way
when
he
was
displeased
he
was
something
of
the
bulldog
and
even
at
this
early
period
the
first
and
second
forms
showed
signs
of
meek
surrender
to
his
leadership
but
he
was
of
course
not
happy
he
was
entirely
miserable
he
would
be
happier
later
on
when
he
had
been
able
to
arrange
all
these
puzzling
certainties
so
different
from
those
dazzling
imaginations
that
he
had
painted
how
strange
of
him
to
have
been
so
glad
to
leave
stephen
and
the
others
even
old
curtis
what
could
he
have
thought
was
coming
he
remembered
as
though
it
had
been
another
life
that
christmas
eve
the
fight
the
beating
the
carols
and
yet
with
it
all
with
the
dreariness
and
greyness
and
fierceness
and
dirtiness
of
it
all
he
would
not
change
it
for
those
earlier
things
this
was
growing
this
was
growing
up
he
was
certainly
happier
after
his
meeting
with
cardillac
cards
as
he
was
always
called
here
was
a
hero
indeed
not
to
displace
of
course
stephen
who
remained
as
a
window
remains
to
be
looked
at
and
treasured
and
remembered
but
here
was
a
living
wonder
every
movement
that
cards
made
was
astounding
and
not
only
peter
felt
it
even
the
masters
seemed
to
suggest
that
he
was
different
from
the
rest
and
watched
him
admiringly
cards
was
only
fourteen
but
he
had
seen
the
world
he
had
been
with
his
mother
his
father
was
dead
about
europe
he
knew
london
he
had
been
to
the
theatres
school
he
gave
them
all
to
understand
was
an
interim
in
the
social
round
he
took
peter
worship
very
easily
and
went
for
walks
with
him
and
talked
in
a
wonderful
way
he
admired
peter
strength
peter
found
that
galleon
bobby
galleon
was
disappointing
not
very
interesting
he
had
never
read
his
father
books
and
he
could
tell
peter
very
much
about
the
great
man
he
was
proud
of
him
but
rather
reserved
he
had
not
many
ideas
about
anything
and
indeed
when
he
went
for
a
walk
with
peter
was
usually
very
silent
although
always
in
a
good
temper
cards
thought
galleon
very
dull
and
never
spoke
to
him
if
he
could
avoid
doing
so
and
peter
was
sometimes
quite
angry
with
galleon
because
he
would
turn
up
so
when
one
might
have
had
cards
to
oneself
peter
main
feeling
about
it
all
when
half
term
arrived
was
that
one
must
just
stand
with
one
back
to
the
wall
if
one
was
to
avoid
being
hurt
he
did
not
now
plunge
into
broils
to
help
other
people
he
found
that
it
did
not
in
reality
help
them
and
that
it
only
meant
that
he
got
kicked
as
well
as
the
other
boy
one
life
was
a
diligent
watchfulness
with
the
end
in
view
of
avoiding
the
enemy
the
enemy
was
to
be
found
in
any
shape
and
form
there
was
no
security
by
night
or
day
but
on
the
whole
life
was
safer
if
one
spoke
as
little
as
possible
and
stuck
to
the
wall
there
were
devils
most
certainly
devils
roaming
the
world
and
as
he
watched
the
torture
and
the
terror
and
then
the
very
dreadful
submission
he
vowed
with
clenched
lips
that
he
would
never
submit
and
so
gradually
he
was
learning
the
truth
of
that
which
frosted
moses
had
spoken
cornwall
meanwhile
the
grey
hill
scaw
house
the
hills
above
truro
remained
to
him
during
these
weeks
securely
hidden
iii
there
remains
to
be
chronicled
of
that
first
term
only
the
comber
fight
and
a
little
conversation
one
windy
day
with
galleon
the
small
boy
by
name
beech
minimus
whom
peter
had
defended
on
that
earlier
occasion
had
attached
himself
with
unswerving
fidelity
to
his
preserver
he
was
round
and
fat
and
on
his
arrival
had
had
red
cheeks
and
sparkling
eyes
now
he
was
pale
and
there
were
lines
under
his
eyes
he
started
if
any
one
spoke
to
him
and
was
always
eager
to
hide
when
possible
peter
was
very
sorry
for
him
but
after
a
month
of
the
term
had
passed
he
had
himself
acquired
the
indifference
of
those
that
stand
with
their
backs
to
the
wall
beech
would
go
on
any
kind
of
errand
for
him
and
would
willingly
have
died
for
him
had
it
been
required
of
him
he
did
indeed
during
the
hours
that
he
was
left
in
peace
in
his
dormitory
picture
to
himself
wonderful
scenes
in
which
he
saved
peter
from
horrible
deaths
and
for
his
own
part
perished
it
may
have
been
that
he
clung
to
peter
partly
because
there
was
more
safety
in
his
neighbourhood
for
amongst
the
lower
school
boys
at
any
rate
very
considerable
fear
of
peter
was
to
be
noticed
but
large
eyes
raised
to
the
other
boy
face
or
his
eager
smile
as
he
did
something
that
peter
required
of
him
spoke
devotion
beech
minimus
was
forced
however
for
the
good
of
his
soul
to
suffer
especial
torture
between
the
hours
of
eight
and
nine
in
the
evening
it
was
the
custom
that
the
lower
school
should
retire
from
preparation
at
eight
it
being
supposed
that
at
that
hour
the
lower
school
went
to
bed
but
authority
blinded
by
trustful
good
nature
and
being
engaged
at
that
hour
with
its
wine
and
dinner
left
the
issue
to
chance
and
the
gods
and
human
nature
being
what
it
is
the
lower
school
triumphed
in
freedom
there
was
a
large
empty
class
room
at
the
back
of
the
building
where
much
noise
might
safely
be
made
and
in
this
place
and
at
this
hour
followed
the
nightly
torture
of
beech
and
his
minute
companions
that
torture
named
by
the
gods
discipline
by
the
authorities
boys
will
be
boys
by
the
parent
learning
to
be
a
man
and
by
the
lower
school
a
beech
and
his
companions
had
not
as
yet
a
name
for
it
peter
was
as
a
rule
left
to
his
own
thoughts
and
spent
the
hours
amongst
the
greatcoats
in
the
passage
reading
david
copperfield
or
talking
in
whispers
to
bobby
galleon
but
nevertheless
he
was
not
really
indifferent
he
was
horribly
conscious
even
in
his
sleep
of
beech
shrill
oh
comber
do
please
comber
oh
and
beech
being
in
the
same
dormitory
as
himself
he
noticed
almost
against
his
will
that
shivering
little
mortal
as
he
crept
into
bed
and
cowered
beneath
the
sheets
wondering
whether
before
morning
he
would
be
tossed
in
sheets
or
would
find
his
bed
drenched
in
water
or
would
be
beaten
with
hair
brushes
peter
philosophy
of
standing
it
in
silence
and
hitting
back
if
he
were
himself
attacked
was
scarcely
satisfactory
in
beech
case
and
again
and
again
his
attention
would
be
dragged
away
from
his
book
to
that
other
room
where
some
small
boys
were
learning
lessons
in
life
the
head
of
this
pleasant
sport
was
one
comber
a
large
boy
some
years
older
than
his
place
in
the
school
justified
but
of
a
crass
stupidity
a
greedy
stomach
and
a
vicious
cruelty
peter
had
already
met
him
in
football
and
had
annoyed
him
by
collaring
him
violently
on
one
occasion
it
being
the
boy
habit
owing
to
his
size
and
reputation
to
run
down
the
field
in
the
lower
school
game
unattacked
peter
hatred
of
him
grew
more
intense
week
by
week
some
days
after
it
had
swollen
into
a
passion
he
finally
told
bobby
galleon
one
day
at
luncheon
that
on
that
very
evening
he
was
going
to
defy
this
comber
galleon
besought
him
not
to
do
this
pointing
out
comber
greater
strength
and
the
natural
tendency
of
the
lower
school
to
follow
their
leader
blindly
peter
said
nothing
in
reply
but
watched
when
eight
had
struck
and
the
lower
school
had
assembled
in
the
class
room
for
his
moment
it
was
a
somewhat
piteous
spectacle
comber
and
some
half
a
dozen
friends
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
forty
boys
ranging
in
years
from
eight
to
twelve
waiting
with
white
faces
and
propitiatory
smiles
eager
to
assist
in
the
torture
if
they
only
might
themselves
be
spared
now
you
chaps
this
from
comber
we
have
a
gauntlet
i
votes
we
make
young
beech
run
rather
come
on
beech
you
jolly
well
got
buck
up
you
funk
from
those
relieved
that
they
were
themselves
for
the
instant
safe
peter
was
sitting
on
a
bench
at
the
back
of
the
room
he
stood
on
the
bench
and
shouted
you
a
beast
there
was
immediate
silence
every
one
turned
first
to
comber
and
then
back
to
peter
comber
paused
in
the
preparation
of
the
string
whip
that
he
was
making
and
his
face
was
crimson
oh
it
you
you
young
skunk
is
it
bring
him
here
some
of
you
eager
movements
were
made
in
his
direction
but
peter
still
standing
on
his
bench
shouted
i
claim
a
there
was
silence
again
a
silence
now
of
incredulity
and
amazement
but
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
if
any
one
claimed
a
fight
by
all
the
rules
and
traditions
of
dawson
he
must
have
it
but
that
westcott
a
new
boy
and
in
the
bottom
form
should
challenge
comber
slowly
and
as
it
were
against
their
will
hearts
beat
a
little
faster
faces
brightened
of
course
westcott
would
be
most
hopelessly
beaten
but
might
not
this
prove
the
beginning
of
the
end
of
their
tyrant
meanwhile
comber
between
his
teeth
all
right
you
young
devil
give
you
such
a
hiding
as
you
damned
well
wo
forget
then
we
treat
you
properly
a
ring
was
made
and
there
was
silence
so
that
the
prefects
might
not
be
attracted
because
fighting
in
the
lower
school
was
forbidden
coats
were
taken
off
and
peter
faced
comber
with
the
sensation
of
attacking
a
mountain
peter
knew
nothing
about
fighting
at
all
but
comber
had
long
subsisted
on
an
easy
reputation
and
he
was
a
coward
at
heart
there
swung
into
peter
brain
the
picture
of
the
bending
mule
the
crowding
faces
the
swinging
lamp
stephen
with
the
blow
it
was
the
first
time
for
weeks
that
he
had
thought
of
treliss
he
was
indifferent
he
did
not
care
things
could
not
be
worse
and
he
did
not
mind
what
happened
to
him
and
comber
minded
very
much
indeed
and
he
had
not
been
hit
in
the
face
for
a
long
time
his
arms
went
round
like
windmills
and
the
things
that
he
would
like
to
have
done
were
to
pull
peter
hair
from
its
roots
and
to
bite
him
on
the
arm
as
the
fight
proceeded
and
he
knew
that
his
face
was
bleeding
and
that
the
end
of
his
nose
had
no
sensation
in
it
at
all
he
kicked
with
his
feet
and
was
conscious
of
cries
that
he
was
not
playing
the
game
infuriated
that
his
recent
supporters
should
so
easily
desert
him
he
now
flung
himself
upon
peter
who
at
once
gave
way
beneath
the
bigger
boy
weight
comber
then
began
to
bite
and
tear
and
scratch
uttering
shrill
screams
of
rage
and
kicking
on
the
floor
with
his
feet
he
was
at
once
pulled
away
assured
by
those
dearest
friends
who
had
so
recently
and
merrily
assisted
him
in
his
rags
that
he
was
not
playing
the
game
and
was
no
sportsman
he
was
moreover
a
ludicrous
sight
his
trousers
being
torn
one
eye
staring
from
a
confused
outline
of
dust
and
blood
his
hair
amazingly
on
end
there
were
also
many
cries
of
shame
comber
dirty
game
and
even
well
played
young
westcott
he
knew
as
he
wept
bitter
tears
into
his
hands
that
his
reign
was
at
an
end
there
were
indeed
for
the
time
at
any
rate
no
more
rags
and
peter
might
an
he
would
have
reigned
magnificently
over
the
lower
school
but
he
was
as
silent
and
aloof
as
ever
and
was
considered
a
sidey
devil
but
jolly
plucky
by
and
for
himself
he
got
at
any
rate
the
more
continued
companionship
of
cards
who
languidly
and
perhaps
a
younger
sir
willoughby
patterne
with
a
leg
admired
his
muscle
iv
finally
towards
the
end
of
the
term
peter
and
bobby
galleon
may
be
seen
sitting
on
a
high
hill
it
is
a
sunday
afternoon
in
spring
and
far
away
there
is
a
thin
line
of
faintly
blue
hills
nearer
to
view
there
are
grey
heights
more
sharply
outlined
and
rough
like
drawing
paper
painted
with
a
green
wood
a
farm
a
black
church
spire
and
a
brown
ploughed
field
immediately
below
them
a
green
hedge
hanging
over
a
running
stream
that
has
caught
the
blue
of
the
sky
above
them
vast
swollen
clouds
flooding
slowly
with
the
faint
yellow
of
the
coming
sunset
hanging
stationary
above
the
stream
and
seeming
to
have
flung
to
earth
some
patches
of
their
colour
in
the
first
primroses
below
the
hedge
a
rabbit
watches
his
head
out
of
his
hole
the
boys
voices
cut
the
air
i
say
bobby
do
you
ever
wonder
about
things
you
never
seem
to
want
to
ask
no
i
do
suppose
i
do
i
awfully
stupid
father
says
it
funny
your
being
stupid
when
your
father
so
do
you
mind
my
being
stupid
no
only
i
like
you
to
want
to
know
things
things
like
what
people
are
like
inside
their
thinking
part
i
mean
not
their
real
insides
people
like
mother
gill
and
old
binns
and
prester
ma
and
then
what
one
going
to
do
when
one
grown
up
you
never
want
to
know
no
it
just
come
i
suppose
of
course
i
sha
be
clever
like
the
no
i
do
think
you
once
again
do
you
mind
my
being
so
stupid
peter
no
i
awfully
stupid
too
but
i
like
to
wonder
about
things
there
was
once
a
man
i
met
at
home
with
rings
and
things
who
lived
in
london
peter
stops
galleon
would
be
interested
in
that
anyhow
you
know
you
got
cards
he
an
awfully
clever
yes
he
wonderful
peter
sighs
and
he
seen
such
a
lot
of
yes
but
you
know
i
do
think
cards
really
cares
for
you
as
much
as
i
this
is
an
approach
to
sentiment
and
peter
brushes
it
hastily
aside
i
like
you
both
awfully
but
i
say
wo
it
be
splendid
to
be
grown
up
in
london
i
do
know
lots
of
fellows
do
like
that
nothing
peter
says
slowly
to
do
with
its
not
being
splendid
and
the
rabbit
tired
of
listening
to
such
tiresome
stuff
thinks
that
they
must
be
very
young
boys
indeed
chapter
vi
a
a
silver
a
glass
of
whisky
and
vox
populi
i
peter
thirteen
to
sixteen
and
left
so
it
appears
very
much
the
same
as
far
as
actual
possessions
go
at
the
end
of
it
as
at
the
commencement
friendship
honour
glory
how
these
things
came
and
went
with
him
during
these
years
might
have
a
book
to
themselves
were
it
not
that
our
business
is
with
a
wider
stage
and
more
lasting
issues
and
there
is
but
little
room
for
a
chronicle
though
dawson
and
to
take
the
history
of
miss
gill
only
of
her
love
affair
with
the
curate
of
her
final
desperate
appeal
to
him
and
of
his
ultimate
confession
that
he
was
married
already
provides
a
story
quite
sufficient
for
three
excellent
volumes
or
there
is
the
history
of
benbow
that
bucolic
gentleman
into
whose
study
we
led
peter
a
chapter
or
two
ago
head
for
this
year
or
two
of
dawson
soon
to
be
head
of
nothing
but
the
and
there
to
crow
only
dismally
with
a
childlike
benbow
led
unwittingly
to
as
a
lamb
to
the
later
to
flee
crying
back
to
her
hearth
and
home
her
life
smashed
to
the
tiniest
pieces
and
no
brain
nor
strength
to
put
it
together
again
or
there
is
the
natural
and
interesting
progression
on
the
part
of
any
child
behind
whose
back
those
iron
gates
of
dawson
have
swung
from
innocence
to
knowledge
from
knowledge
to
practice
from
practice
to
miserable
submission
concealment
and
a
merry
prospective
hell
this
is
a
diverting
study
with
which
it
would
be
easy
to
fill
these
pages
but
the
theme
is
peter
education
and
dawson
is
only
an
incident
to
that
history
an
incident
that
may
be
taken
by
the
percipient
reader
for
a
most
admirable
symbol
even
an
early
rehearsal
of
a
comedy
entitled
how
to
learn
to
be
a
man
or
the
world
as
a
prancing
but
with
peter
if
you
take
him
from
that
first
asking
trussit
swinging
his
short
legs
from
the
table
and
diving
into
the
mixed
biscuit
tin
is
it
trussit
like
david
copperfield
to
his
meeting
of
her
again
he
still
rather
but
no
longer
caring
over
much
for
mixed
biscuits
in
his
sixteenth
year
with
dawson
over
and
done
with
no
trussit
not
in
the
least
like
and
grimly
said
in
addition
the
changes
alterations
and
general
development
may
be
said
to
be
inside
him
rather
than
out
and
there
they
are
vital
enough
with
those
three
and
a
half
years
it
is
a
case
of
things
sticking
out
like
hillocks
in
a
flat
country
and
it
is
retrospection
rather
than
impressions
at
the
time
that
show
what
mattered
and
what
did
not
but
on
the
whole
the
vital
things
at
dawson
are
pretty
plain
to
the
eye
and
must
be
squeezed
into
a
chapter
as
best
they
can
treliss
as
it
appeared
in
the
holidays
seemed
to
peter
to
change
very
little
his
relations
with
his
father
were
curiously
passive
during
this
time
and
suggested
in
their
hint
of
future
developments
something
ominous
and
uneasy
they
scarcely
ever
spoke
to
one
another
and
it
was
peter
object
to
avoid
the
house
as
often
as
possible
but
in
his
father
silence
now
peter
himself
being
older
and
intuitively
sharper
as
to
the
reason
of
things
he
saw
active
dislike
and
even
at
times
a
suggested
fear
outwardly
they
his
father
his
grandfather
his
aunt
trussit
had
changed
not
at
all
his
grandfather
the
same
old
creature
of
grey
hairs
and
cushions
and
rugs
his
father
broad
and
square
and
white
in
the
face
with
his
black
hair
carefully
brushed
his
aunt
with
her
mittens
and
trembling
hands
and
silly
voice
trussit
with
her
black
silk
gown
and
stout
prosperous
face
oh
they
were
all
there
but
he
fancied
and
this
might
easily
be
imagination
that
they
like
the
portraits
of
the
old
westcotts
about
the
walls
watched
him
as
he
grew
knowing
that
ever
as
the
months
passed
the
day
came
nearer
when
father
and
son
must
come
to
terms
and
beyond
this
he
had
even
at
this
early
time
a
consciousness
that
it
was
round
his
mother
room
that
the
whole
matter
hung
his
mother
whom
he
saw
once
or
twice
a
week
for
a
very
little
time
in
the
morning
when
that
old
terror
of
the
white
silent
room
would
creep
upon
him
and
hold
him
and
yet
with
it
all
he
knew
as
every
holiday
came
more
clearly
that
again
and
again
they
his
mother
and
himself
were
on
the
verge
of
speech
or
action
he
could
see
it
in
her
eyes
her
beautiful
grey
eyes
that
moved
him
so
curiously
there
were
days
when
he
was
on
the
edge
of
a
rush
of
questions
and
then
something
held
him
back
perhaps
the
unconscious
certainty
that
his
mother
answers
would
precipitate
his
relations
with
his
father
and
he
was
not
as
yet
ready
anyhow
a
grim
place
scaw
house
grimmer
with
every
return
to
it
and
not
a
brightly
coloured
interlude
to
dawson
grim
enough
in
its
own
conditions
the
silence
that
was
gradually
growing
with
peter
the
fixed
assurance
whether
at
home
or
at
school
that
life
was
easier
if
one
said
nothing
might
have
found
an
outlet
in
stephen
company
but
here
again
there
was
no
cheerful
chronicle
each
holiday
showed
peter
less
of
stephen
than
the
last
had
done
and
he
was
afraid
to
ask
himself
why
this
was
perhaps
in
reality
he
did
not
know
but
at
any
rate
he
was
sure
that
the
change
was
in
stephen
he
cared
for
stephen
as
devotedly
as
ever
and
indeed
in
that
perhaps
he
needed
him
more
than
ever
and
saw
him
so
little
his
affection
was
even
stronger
than
it
had
been
but
stephen
had
changed
not
peter
knew
in
any
affection
towards
himself
but
in
his
own
habits
and
person
burstead
his
old
enemy
had
taken
a
farm
near
his
own
farm
in
order
so
they
said
at
the
bending
mule
that
he
might
flaunt
burstead
once
stephen
sweetheart
in
stephen
face
they
also
said
that
burstead
beat
his
wife
and
her
horribly
and
that
she
would
give
all
her
soul
now
that
she
was
stephen
wife
but
that
she
was
a
weak
silly
young
woman
poor
thing
they
said
that
stephen
knew
all
this
and
that
he
could
hear
her
crying
at
nights
and
that
it
was
sending
him
off
his
head
and
that
he
was
drinking
and
they
shook
their
heads
down
at
the
bending
mule
and
foreboded
ill
moreover
that
old
lady
brant
had
died
during
peter
first
year
at
dawson
and
stephen
was
alone
now
he
had
changed
in
his
appearance
his
beard
tangled
and
untidy
his
clothes
unbrushed
and
his
eyes
wild
and
bloodshot
and
once
peter
had
ventured
up
to
farm
and
had
climbed
the
stairs
and
had
opened
the
door
and
had
seen
stephen
although
it
was
early
evening
sitting
all
naked
on
his
bed
very
drunk
and
shouting
wildly
and
he
had
not
recognised
peter
but
the
boy
knew
when
he
met
him
again
sober
this
time
by
the
sad
look
in
his
eyes
that
stephen
must
go
his
way
alone
now
lead
him
where
it
would
a
boy
of
fifteen
could
not
help
and
so
those
holidays
were
more
and
more
lonely
as
the
days
passed
and
peter
heart
was
very
heavy
he
did
not
go
often
to
the
bending
mule
now
because
stephen
was
not
there
he
went
once
or
twice
to
zachary
tan
shop
but
he
did
not
see
zanti
again
nor
any
one
who
spoke
of
london
he
had
not
however
forgotten
zanti
talk
of
as
he
grew
and
his
mind
distinguished
more
clearly
between
fact
and
fancy
he
saw
that
it
was
foolish
to
suppose
that
one
saw
anything
in
but
the
immediate
view
tables
and
chairs
walls
and
windows
dust
and
there
was
the
furniture
of
a
nevertheless
during
his
first
year
at
school
he
had
on
occasions
climbed
to
his
dormitory
seen
that
he
was
alone
and
then
gazed
into
his
glass
and
thought
of
london
london
in
his
young
brain
being
a
place
of
romantic
fog
pantomime
oranges
fat
chivalrous
old
gentlemen
queen
victoria
and
punch
and
judy
nothing
had
happened
of
course
nothing
had
happened
it
was
only
very
cold
and
unpleasant
up
there
all
alone
and
at
the
end
of
it
a
silly
thing
to
do
and
then
one
night
something
did
happen
he
woke
suddenly
and
heard
in
the
distance
beyond
the
deep
breathing
of
sleepers
a
clock
strike
three
he
turned
and
lay
on
his
back
he
was
very
sleepy
and
he
did
not
know
why
he
had
wakened
the
long
high
room
was
dark
but
directly
opposite
him
beyond
the
end
of
his
bed
the
light
seemed
to
shine
full
on
to
the
face
of
his
as
he
sat
up
in
bed
and
looked
at
it
seemed
to
stand
out
like
a
sheet
of
silver
he
gripped
the
sides
of
the
bed
and
stared
he
rubbed
his
eyes
he
could
see
no
reflection
in
the
glass
at
all
but
only
this
shining
expanse
and
then
as
he
looked
at
it
that
too
seemed
to
pass
away
and
in
its
place
at
first
confusedly
like
smoke
across
the
face
of
the
glass
and
then
settling
into
shape
and
form
there
appeared
the
interior
of
a
room
a
small
dark
room
there
was
a
large
fire
burning
and
in
front
of
it
kneeling
on
the
floor
with
their
backs
to
peter
were
two
men
and
they
were
thrusting
papers
into
the
fire
the
glass
seemed
to
stretch
and
broaden
out
so
that
the
whole
of
the
room
was
visible
and
suddenly
peter
saw
a
little
window
high
in
the
top
of
the
wall
and
behind
that
window
was
a
face
that
watched
the
two
men
he
wanted
to
warn
them
he
suddenly
cried
out
aloud
look
out
and
with
that
he
was
wide
awake
and
saw
that
his
glass
could
be
only
dimly
discerned
in
the
grey
of
the
advancing
morning
and
yet
he
had
heard
that
clock
strike
three
so
much
for
confusing
dreams
and
so
vivid
was
it
that
in
the
morning
he
remembered
the
face
at
the
window
and
knew
that
he
would
recognise
it
again
if
he
saw
it
ii
but
out
of
the
three
years
there
stand
his
relations
with
cards
and
young
galleon
a
symbol
of
so
much
that
was
to
come
to
him
later
as
he
grew
in
position
in
the
school
cards
saw
him
continually
cards
undoubtedly
admired
his
stocky
determined
strength
his
grey
eyes
his
brusque
speech
his
ability
at
games
he
did
not
pretend
also
that
he
was
not
flattered
by
peter
attentions
curiously
for
so
young
a
boy
he
had
a
satirical
irony
that
showed
him
the
world
very
much
in
the
light
that
he
was
always
afterwards
to
see
it
to
cards
the
world
was
a
show
a
vanity
fair
a
place
where
manner
dignity
humour
and
ease
mattered
everything
he
saw
also
that
there
was
nothing
by
which
people
are
so
easily
deceived
peter
had
none
of
these
things
he
would
always
be
rough
he
would
never
be
elegant
and
afterwards
in
life
cards
did
not
suppose
that
he
would
see
very
much
of
peter
their
lives
would
be
along
different
paths
but
now
more
genuinely
perhaps
than
ever
again
cards
was
to
admire
that
honest
bedrock
of
feeling
of
sentiment
of
criticism
of
love
and
anger
that
gave
peter
his
immense
value
there
is
a
fellow
here
wrote
cards
to
his
mother
whom
i
like
very
much
he
got
a
most
awful
lot
of
stuff
in
him
although
he
does
say
much
and
he
looks
like
nothing
on
earth
sometimes
he
very
good
at
football
although
he
only
been
here
a
year
his
name
is
westcott
peter
westcott
i
expect
i
bring
him
back
one
but
of
course
he
never
did
peter
when
it
came
to
actuality
look
right
at
home
it
was
during
peter
second
year
that
these
things
were
happening
and
all
this
time
peter
was
climbing
slowly
to
a
very
real
popularity
cards
was
leaving
at
the
end
of
this
second
year
had
he
stayed
until
the
end
of
the
third
his
superficialities
would
have
been
most
severely
tested
to
him
peter
gave
all
that
love
and
devotion
that
only
stephen
had
known
before
he
gave
it
with
a
very
considerable
sense
of
humour
and
with
no
sentiment
at
all
he
saw
cards
quite
clearly
he
watched
his
poses
and
his
elaborate
pretences
and
he
laughed
at
him
sometimes
and
called
him
names
cards
pride
was
on
several
occasions
distinctly
hurt
by
this
laughter
but
his
certain
conviction
of
his
own
superiority
always
comforted
him
nor
was
peter
ever
sentimental
in
his
attitude
he
never
told
cards
that
he
cared
for
him
and
he
even
hung
back
a
little
when
cards
was
in
a
demonstrative
mood
and
wanted
to
be
told
that
he
was
cards
sometimes
wondered
whether
peter
cared
for
him
at
all
and
whether
he
was
really
fonder
of
that
stupid
ass
galleon
who
never
had
a
word
to
say
for
himself
peter
grey
eyes
would
have
told
cards
a
great
deal
if
he
had
cared
to
examine
them
but
he
did
not
know
anything
about
eyes
peter
noticed
a
little
against
his
will
that
as
he
advanced
up
the
school
so
cards
cared
increasingly
about
him
he
grasped
this
discovery
philosophically
after
all
there
were
many
fellows
who
took
their
colour
from
the
world
opinion
and
it
was
natural
enough
that
they
should
he
himself
regarded
his
growing
popularity
as
a
thing
of
no
importance
whatever
it
did
not
touch
him
anywhere
at
all
because
he
despised
and
hated
the
place
when
the
time
does
come
he
said
once
to
cards
and
one
is
allowed
to
do
things
i
stop
a
lot
of
this
you
have
your
work
cut
out
cards
told
him
what
does
it
all
matter
to
us
let
wallow
and
they
only
hate
cards
added
this
because
he
knew
that
peter
had
a
curious
passion
for
being
liked
cards
wanted
to
be
admired
but
to
be
liked
what
was
the
gain
but
that
second
year
was
in
spite
of
it
all
the
best
time
that
peter
had
ever
had
there
was
warmth
of
a
kind
in
their
appreciation
of
him
he
was
only
fifteen
and
small
for
his
age
but
his
uncompromising
attitude
about
things
his
silence
his
football
gave
him
a
surprising
importance
but
even
now
it
was
respect
rather
than
popularity
he
was
growing
more
like
a
than
ever
his
hair
was
stiff
and
short
rather
shaggy
eyebrows
a
square
jaw
his
short
legs
rather
far
apart
a
broad
back
and
thick
strong
arms
now
that
stephen
had
slipped
so
sadly
into
the
background
he
built
up
his
life
about
cards
he
put
everything
into
that
room
not
the
old
room
that
had
held
stephen
but
a
new
shining
place
that
gained
some
added
brilliance
from
the
fact
that
its
guest
realised
so
little
the
honour
that
was
done
him
he
would
lie
awake
at
night
and
think
about
cards
of
the
things
that
he
would
do
for
him
of
the
way
that
he
would
serve
him
of
the
guardian
that
he
would
be
and
then
as
that
summer
term
at
the
end
of
the
second
year
wore
on
the
pain
of
cards
departure
grew
daily
more
terrible
he
did
know
as
the
days
advanced
how
he
would
be
able
to
bear
that
place
without
cards
there
would
be
no
life
no
interest
and
all
the
disorganisation
the
immorality
the
cruelty
would
oppress
him
as
they
had
never
oppressed
him
before
besides
next
year
he
would
be
a
person
of
some
importance
he
would
probably
be
captain
of
the
football
and
a
monitor
everything
would
be
terribly
hard
of
course
there
was
old
bobby
galleon
who
was
a
very
good
chap
and
really
fond
of
peter
but
there
was
no
excitement
about
relationship
bobby
was
quite
ready
to
play
servant
to
peter
master
and
peter
could
never
respect
any
one
very
much
who
did
that
beside
cards
so
brilliant
so
handsome
with
such
an
air
old
bobby
really
did
come
off
very
well
bobby
also
at
times
was
inclined
to
be
a
little
sentimental
he
used
to
ask
peter
whether
he
liked
him
whether
he
would
miss
him
if
he
died
and
he
used
to
tell
peter
that
he
would
very
gladly
die
for
him
there
were
things
that
one
did
if
one
had
say
that
year
the
summer
was
of
a
blazing
heat
every
morning
saw
a
sky
of
steely
blue
the
corn
stood
like
a
golden
band
about
the
hills
and
little
clouds
like
the
softest
feathers
were
blown
by
the
gods
about
the
world
a
mist
clung
about
the
distant
hills
and
clothed
them
in
purple
grey
as
the
term
grew
to
its
close
peter
felt
that
the
world
was
a
prison
of
coloured
steel
and
that
dawson
was
a
true
hell
he
would
escape
from
it
with
cards
and
then
when
he
saw
that
such
an
escape
would
be
running
away
and
a
confession
of
defeat
he
turned
back
and
held
his
will
in
command
cards
looked
upon
his
approaching
departure
as
a
great
deliverance
he
was
to
be
a
man
immediately
not
for
him
that
absurdly
dilatory
condition
of
pimples
and
hobbledehoy
boots
that
mark
a
transition
period
dawson
had
been
the
most
insignificant
sojourn
in
the
tent
of
the
enemy
and
the
world
it
was
implied
had
lamented
his
enforced
absence
but
as
the
end
of
term
flung
its
shadows
in
front
of
it
in
the
form
of
examinations
and
that
especial
quality
of
excited
expectancy
hovering
about
the
corridors
cards
felt
for
the
first
time
in
his
existence
a
genuine
emotion
he
minded
curiously
leaving
peter
he
felt
although
in
this
he
wrongly
anticipated
the
gods
that
he
would
never
see
him
again
and
he
calculated
perhaps
at
the
little
piece
of
real
affection
and
friendship
that
stood
out
from
the
continental
tour
that
he
wished
life
to
be
like
a
palm
tree
on
the
limitless
desert
and
yet
it
was
characteristic
of
them
both
that
on
the
last
day
when
seated
under
a
hedge
at
the
top
of
the
playing
fields
the
school
buildings
a
grey
mist
below
them
and
the
air
tensely
rigid
with
heat
they
said
to
one
another
it
was
cards
who
found
all
the
words
peter
had
nothing
to
say
at
all
he
only
clutched
at
tufts
of
grass
lugged
them
from
the
earth
and
flung
them
before
him
but
cards
as
usual
rose
to
the
occasion
you
know
peter
it
been
most
splendid
knowing
you
here
i
think
i
ever
have
got
through
dawson
if
it
had
been
for
you
a
hell
of
a
place
and
i
suppose
if
the
mater
had
been
abroad
so
much
i
should
never
have
stayed
on
but
it
no
use
making
a
fuss
besides
it
only
for
a
little
while
one
will
have
forgotten
all
about
it
in
a
year
peter
smiled
you
will
i
why
of
course
you
will
and
you
must
come
and
stay
with
us
often
my
mother
most
awfully
anxious
to
know
you
wo
it
be
splendid
going
out
to
join
her
in
italy
it
be
a
bit
hot
this
time
of
year
i
peter
seemed
to
struggle
with
his
words
i
say
cards
you
wo
altogether
forget
me
forget
you
why
good
lord
i
be
always
writing
i
have
such
lots
to
tell
you
i
never
liked
any
one
in
all
my
life
this
said
with
a
great
sense
of
age
as
i
liked
you
he
stood
up
and
fumbled
in
his
coat
peter
always
remembered
him
his
dark
slim
body
against
the
sky
his
hair
tumbled
about
his
forehead
the
grace
and
ease
with
which
his
body
was
balanced
the
trick
that
he
had
of
swaying
a
little
from
the
hips
he
felt
in
his
pocket
i
say
i
got
something
for
you
i
bought
it
down
in
the
town
the
other
day
and
i
made
them
put
your
name
on
he
produced
it
wrapped
in
tissue
paper
out
of
his
pocket
and
peter
took
it
without
a
word
it
was
a
silver
with
peter
westcott
from
his
friend
cardillac
and
the
month
and
the
year
printed
on
it
thanks
most
awfully
peter
said
gruffly
jolly
decent
of
you
old
they
shook
hands
and
avoided
each
other
eyes
and
cardillac
had
a
sudden
desire
to
fling
the
grand
tour
and
the
rest
of
it
to
the
dogs
and
to
come
back
for
another
year
to
dawson
well
i
must
get
back
got
to
be
in
library
at
four
he
said
i
going
to
stop
here
a
bit
said
peter
he
watched
cards
walk
slowly
down
the
hill
and
then
he
flung
himself
on
his
face
and
pursued
with
a
vacant
eye
the
efforts
of
an
ant
to
climb
a
swaying
blade
of
grass
he
was
there
for
a
long
time
iii
and
so
he
entered
into
his
third
year
at
dawson
with
a
dogged
determination
to
get
through
with
it
as
well
as
possible
and
not
to
miss
cards
more
than
he
could
help
he
did
as
an
actual
fact
miss
cards
terribly
there
were
so
many
places
so
many
things
that
were
connected
with
him
but
he
found
as
a
kind
of
reward
that
bobby
galleon
was
more
of
a
friend
than
before
now
that
cards
had
departed
galleon
came
a
little
out
of
his
shell
he
anticipated
obviously
with
very
considerable
enjoyment
that
year
when
he
would
have
peter
all
to
himself
bobby
galleon
virtue
was
at
any
rate
that
one
was
not
conscious
of
him
and
during
the
time
of
peter
popularity
he
was
useful
without
being
in
the
very
least
evident
when
that
year
was
over
and
he
had
seen
the
last
shining
twinkle
of
cards
charms
and
fascinations
he
looked
at
peter
a
little
wistfully
peter
old
man
next
year
will
be
topping
and
peter
the
pleasant
warmth
of
popularity
about
him
felt
that
there
was
a
great
deal
to
be
said
for
galleon
after
all
but
with
the
first
week
of
that
third
year
trouble
began
things
lifted
between
the
terms
into
so
different
an
air
at
the
end
of
the
summer
with
peter
authority
in
prospect
and
his
splendid
popularity
confined
by
no
insistence
on
rules
around
him
that
immediate
year
seemed
simple
enough
but
in
the
holidays
that
preceded
the
autumn
term
something
had
occurred
peter
returned
in
the
mists
and
damp
of
september
with
every
eye
upon
him
although
only
fifteen
and
a
half
he
was
a
monitor
and
captain
of
the
football
far
too
young
for
both
these
posts
with
fellows
of
a
great
size
and
a
greater
age
in
the
school
but
barbour
his
nose
providing
daily
a
more
lively
guide
to
his
festal
evenings
was
seized
by
peter
silence
and
imperturbability
in
the
midst
of
danger
that
kid
got
guts
this
a
vinous
confidence
amongst
friends
and
will
pull
the
place
up
gettin
a
bit
slack
yer
know
young
lord
bless
yer
no
wonderful
for
his
age
and
captain
of
the
football
that
always
so
upon
peter
the
burden
of
pulling
things
up
descended
how
far
cards
might
have
helped
him
here
it
is
difficult
to
say
cards
had
in
his
apparently
casual
contempt
of
that
school
world
a
remarkably
competent
sense
of
the
direction
in
which
straws
were
blowing
that
most
certainly
peter
had
not
being
inclined
at
this
stage
of
things
to
go
straight
for
the
thing
that
he
saw
and
to
leave
the
outskirts
of
the
subject
to
look
after
themselves
and
here
bobby
galleon
was
of
no
use
to
him
being
as
blundering
and
and
simple
as
a
boy
could
very
well
be
moreover
his
implicit
trust
in
the
perfection
of
that
hero
peter
did
not
help
clarity
of
vision
he
was
never
aware
of
the
causes
of
things
and
only
dimly
noticed
effects
but
he
was
unflinchingly
faithful
the
primrose
path
was
of
course
open
to
peter
he
was
popular
enough
at
the
beginning
of
that
autumn
term
to
do
anything
and
had
he
followed
the
policy
of
his
predecessor
smiling
pleasantly
upon
all
crime
and
even
gently
with
his
own
authority
lending
a
hand
all
would
have
been
well
there
were
boys
with
strangely
simple
names
simple
for
such
criminals
barton
jerrard
watson
west
underbill
who
were
hands
at
their
own
especial
games
and
they
saw
no
reason
at
all
for
disturbance
young
westcott
had
better
not
come
meddling
here
they
muttered
darkly
having
discerned
already
a
tendency
on
his
part
to
show
disapproval
nothing
happened
during
the
first
term
no
concrete
incident
but
peter
had
stepped
by
the
end
of
it
from
an
exultant
popularity
to
an
actual
distrust
and
suspicion
the
football
season
had
not
been
very
successful
and
peter
had
not
the
graces
and
charm
of
a
leader
he
distrusted
the
revelation
of
enthusiasm
because
he
was
himself
so
enthusiastic
and
his
silence
was
mistaken
for
coldness
he
hated
the
criminals
with
the
simple
names
and
showed
them
that
he
hated
them
and
they
in
their
turn
skilfully
and
with
some
very
genuine
humour
persuaded
the
school
that
he
cut
a
very
poor
figure
at
the
absurd
concert
that
closed
the
autumn
term
barbour
and
bulging
hilariously
in
the
chair
peter
knew
that
he
had
lost
his
throne
he
had
bobby
there
was
no
one
else
and
in
a
sudden
bitterness
and
scorn
at
the
fickle
colour
of
that
esteem
that
he
had
valued
so
highly
he
almost
wished
that
he
were
altogether
alone
bobby
only
accentuated
things
nothing
to
go
home
to
nothing
to
come
back
to
the
christmas
holidays
over
he
returned
to
the
easter
term
with
an
eager
determination
to
improve
matters
it
was
geniality
that
he
lacked
he
knew
that
that
was
the
matter
with
him
and
he
felt
a
kind
of
despair
about
it
because
he
seemed
to
return
at
the
end
of
every
holiday
from
cornwall
with
that
old
conviction
in
his
head
that
the
easiest
way
to
get
through
the
world
was
to
stand
with
your
back
to
the
wall
and
say
nothing
and
if
these
fellows
who
thought
him
so
pleasant
last
year
thought
him
pleasant
no
longer
well
then
he
must
put
up
with
it
he
had
not
changed
there
he
was
as
ever
but
the
easter
term
was
a
chronicle
of
mistakes
he
could
not
be
genial
to
people
who
defied
and
mocked
him
he
found
dangerously
that
they
could
all
be
afraid
of
him
when
his
face
was
white
and
his
voice
very
quiet
and
his
whole
body
tense
like
a
bow
then
they
feared
him
the
biggest
and
strongest
of
those
criminals
obeyed
he
was
sixteen
now
and
he
could
when
he
liked
rule
them
all
and
gradually
as
the
term
advanced
he
used
his
strength
more
and
more
and
was
more
and
more
alone
days
would
come
when
he
would
hate
his
loneliness
and
would
rush
out
of
it
with
friendly
advances
and
always
he
would
be
beaten
back
into
his
reserve
again
had
only
cards
been
there
but
what
side
would
cards
have
taken
perhaps
peter
was
fortunate
in
that
the
test
was
not
demanded
poor
bobby
simply
did
not
understand
it
at
all
peter
the
most
splendid
fellow
in
the
world
what
were
they
all
up
to
but
that
point
of
view
did
not
help
matters
no
other
monitor
spoke
to
peter
now
if
he
could
help
it
and
even
the
masters
judging
that
where
there
was
smoke
there
must
be
fire
passed
him
coldly
that
easter
term
in
the
late
winds
and
rains
of
march
closed
hideously
the
easter
holidays
although
perhaps
he
did
not
realise
it
were
a
deliberate
backing
for
the
ordeal
that
was
he
knew
to
come
he
faced
it
on
his
return
almost
humorously
prepared
with
a
that
was
unusual
in
him
for
all
the
worst
things
and
it
is
true
enough
that
they
were
as
bad
as
they
could
be
bobby
galleon
shared
in
it
all
of
course
but
he
had
never
been
a
popular
person
and
he
did
not
miss
anything
so
long
as
there
was
peter
once
he
said
as
cards
had
said
before
leave
alone
peter
after
all
we
ca
do
anything
they
too
many
for
us
and
most
important
thing
of
all
they
are
worth
not
much
said
peter
things
have
got
to
be
things
were
not
different
they
too
many
for
him
but
he
struggled
on
the
more
open
bullying
he
stopped
and
there
were
other
things
that
he
drove
into
dark
corners
but
they
remained
there
in
those
corners
there
were
so
many
dark
places
at
dawson
and
it
began
to
get
on
his
brain
so
that
he
heard
whispers
and
suspicions
and
marked
the
trail
of
the
beast
at
every
minute
of
the
day
he
could
find
nothing
now
in
the
open
they
were
too
clever
for
him
the
captain
of
the
citadel
ellershaw
was
as
he
knew
the
worst
fellow
in
the
school
but
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
nothing
unless
something
were
caught
in
the
open
as
the
term
advanced
the
whispers
grew
and
he
felt
that
there
were
plots
in
the
air
he
was
obeyed
ellershaw
and
some
of
the
others
were
politer
than
they
had
ever
been
and
for
many
weeks
now
there
had
been
no
disturbance
then
suddenly
the
storm
broke
one
hot
afternoon
he
was
sitting
in
his
study
alone
trying
to
read
things
seemed
to
him
that
day
at
their
very
worst
there
was
no
place
to
which
he
might
turn
people
were
playing
cricket
beyond
his
window
some
fly
buzzed
on
his
window
pane
the
sunlight
was
golden
about
his
room
and
little
ladders
of
dust
twisted
and
curved
against
the
glare
the
house
was
very
still
then
suddenly
from
a
neighbouring
study
there
were
sounds
at
first
they
did
not
penetrate
his
day
dream
then
they
caught
his
ear
and
he
put
his
book
down
and
listened
the
sounds
were
muffled
there
was
laughter
and
then
some
one
cried
out
he
knew
that
it
was
jerrard
study
and
he
hated
jerrard
more
than
any
one
in
the
school
the
fellow
was
a
huge
stupid
oaf
low
down
in
the
middle
fourth
but
the
best
bowler
that
the
school
had
yes
he
hated
him
he
opened
his
study
door
and
listened
the
passage
was
deserted
and
for
a
moment
there
was
no
sound
save
some
one
shouting
down
in
the
cricket
field
and
the
buzzing
of
the
fly
on
the
pane
then
he
heard
voices
from
behind
jerrard
door
no
i
say
jerrard
do
give
me
any
more
please
please
there
i
say
hold
his
mouth
open
that
right
pour
it
down
have
him
singing
in
a
oh
i
say
there
were
sounds
of
a
struggle
and
then
silence
again
at
last
there
began
the
most
horrible
laughter
that
peter
had
ever
known
weak
silly
giggling
and
little
excited
cries
then
jerrard
voice
there
that
will
do
he
merry
enough
peter
waited
for
no
more
but
strode
across
the
passage
and
flung
open
the
door
some
chairs
were
overturned
jerrard
and
a
friend
hearing
the
door
open
had
turned
round
leaning
against
the
table
very
flushed
his
eyes
shining
his
hair
covered
with
dust
waving
his
arms
and
singing
in
a
quivering
voice
was
a
small
boy
very
drunk
a
glass
and
a
whisky
bottle
were
on
the
table
you
damned
hound
peter
was
trembling
from
head
to
foot
you
shall
get
kicked
out
for
peter
closed
the
door
quietly
behind
him
and
went
back
to
his
study
here
at
last
was
the
moment
for
which
he
had
been
waiting
jerrard
should
be
expelled
if
he
peter
died
in
the
attempt
jerrard
was
the
school
best
bowler
he
was
immensely
popular
it
would
indeed
be
a
matter
of
life
and
death
on
that
same
evening
he
called
a
meeting
of
the
monitors
they
were
bound
to
meet
if
one
of
their
number
had
anything
of
sufficient
importance
to
declare
but
they
came
reluctantly
and
showed
peter
that
they
resented
his
action
when
they
heard
what
peter
had
to
say
their
attitude
was
even
more
mutinous
jerrard
the
school
best
bowler
was
their
one
thought
the
end
of
the
term
was
at
hand
and
the
great
match
of
the
year
against
radford
a
neighbouring
school
approached
without
jerrard
dawson
would
be
hopelessly
defeated
if
barbour
heard
of
the
incident
jerrard
would
be
expelled
barbour
might
be
reluctant
to
act
but
act
he
must
they
were
not
by
an
absurd
and
ancient
rule
allowed
to
punish
any
grave
offence
without
reporting
it
to
the
if
therefore
they
took
any
action
at
all
it
must
be
reported
jerrard
would
be
expelled
a
boon
companion
and
the
great
cricket
match
of
the
year
would
be
lost
and
all
this
through
that
interfering
prig
of
a
westcott
any
ordinary
fellow
would
have
shut
his
eyes
to
the
whole
affair
after
all
what
is
there
to
make
a
fuss
about
in
having
a
rag
with
a
kid
what
are
kids
for
thus
the
conclave
sourly
regarding
peter
who
watched
them
in
turn
and
sat
sternly
ominously
militant
they
approached
him
with
courtesy
ellershaw
showed
him
what
this
might
mean
to
the
school
were
it
persisted
in
after
all
jerrard
was
in
all
probability
sorry
enough
it
was
a
rotten
thing
to
do
he
should
apologise
to
them
no
peter
would
have
none
of
it
they
must
it
must
be
reported
to
the
head
he
would
if
necessary
report
it
himself
then
they
turned
and
cursed
him
asking
him
whom
he
thought
that
he
was
warned
him
about
the
way
that
the
school
would
take
his
interference
when
the
school
knew
advised
him
for
his
own
good
to
drop
the
matter
peter
was
unmoved
barbour
was
informed
jerrard
was
expelled
the
school
was
beaten
in
the
cricket
match
by
an
innings
then
the
storm
broke
peter
moved
with
bobby
galleon
through
a
cloud
of
enemies
it
was
a
hostility
that
cut
like
a
knife
silent
motionless
but
so
bitter
that
every
boy
from
ellershaw
to
the
tiniest
infant
at
the
bottom
of
the
first
took
it
as
the
of
his
day
that
beast
westcott
was
the
song
that
rang
through
the
last
fortnight
bobby
galleon
was
cowed
by
it
he
did
not
mind
his
own
ostracism
and
he
was
proud
that
he
could
give
practical
effect
to
his
devotion
for
his
friend
but
deep
down
in
his
loyalty
there
was
an
unconfessed
suspicion
as
to
whether
peter
after
all
had
been
a
little
unwise
and
interfering
what
was
the
good
of
making
all
this
trouble
he
even
wondered
whether
peter
did
rather
enjoy
it
and
peter
for
the
first
time
in
his
school
life
was
happy
there
was
something
after
all
in
being
up
against
all
these
people
he
was
a
general
fighting
against
tremendous
odds
he
would
show
them
next
year
that
they
must
obey
on
the
last
afternoon
of
the
term
he
sat
alone
in
his
study
bobby
was
with
the
matron
packing
he
was
conscious
as
he
sat
there
of
the
sound
of
many
feet
shuffling
there
were
many
whispers
beyond
his
door
and
yet
a
great
silence
he
waited
for
a
little
and
then
he
opened
his
door
and
looked
out
as
he
did
so
the
bell
for
rang
through
the
building
and
he
knew
that
it
was
his
roll
afternoon
was
always
taken
in
the
gymnasium
a
large
empty
room
beyond
the
study
passage
and
it
was
the
custom
for
boys
to
come
up
as
their
name
was
about
to
be
called
and
thus
to
pass
on
but
he
saw
that
the
whole
of
the
school
was
gathered
there
along
the
dusky
passage
and
packed
in
a
silent
motionless
throng
into
the
gymnasium
he
knew
that
they
were
all
there
with
a
purpose
and
suddenly
as
he
realised
the
insult
that
they
intended
that
spirit
of
exultation
came
upon
him
again
ah
it
was
worth
while
this
battle
they
made
way
in
silence
as
he
passed
quietly
to
the
other
end
of
the
gymnasium
and
stood
a
little
above
them
on
the
steps
that
led
to
the
gallery
he
started
the
with
the
head
of
the
school
and
the
sixth
form
there
was
no
answer
to
any
name
only
perfect
silence
and
every
eye
fixed
upon
him
for
a
wild
moment
he
wished
to
burst
out
upon
them
to
crash
their
heads
together
to
hurt
then
his
returned
very
quietly
and
clearly
he
read
through
the
school
list
a
faint
smile
on
his
lips
bobby
galleon
was
the
only
boy
out
of
three
hundred
who
answered
when
he
had
finished
he
called
out
as
was
the
custom
roll
is
over
then
for
a
brief
instant
with
the
list
in
his
hand
smiling
he
faced
them
all
every
eye
was
upon
him
ellershaw
west
barton
smiling
a
little
some
faces
nervous
some
excited
all
bitterly
intensely
hostile
and
he
must
return
next
year
he
came
down
from
the
steps
and
walked
very
slowly
to
the
door
and
then
as
his
fingers
touched
the
handle
there
was
a
sound
a
whisper
very
soft
and
then
louder
it
grew
about
his
ear
like
a
shot
the
whole
school
motionless
as
before
was
hissing
him
there
was
no
word
spoken
and
he
closed
the
door
behind
him
iv
that
same
night
he
walked
before
chapel
with
bobby
to
the
top
of
the
playing
fields
the
night
was
dark
and
heavy
with
no
moon
nor
stars
but
there
was
a
cool
wind
that
touched
his
cheek
well
i
been
a
pretty
good
failure
bobby
you
stuck
to
me
like
a
brick
i
shall
never
forget
it
but
you
know
never
in
all
my
life
have
i
been
as
happy
as
i
was
this
afternoon
the
devils
i
have
under
next
that
not
the
way
bobby
tried
timorously
to
explain
oh
yes
it
is
anyhow
it
my
way
i
wonder
what
there
is
about
me
that
makes
people
hate
me
people
yes
they
do
at
home
here
it
all
the
same
i
always
having
to
fight
about
something
always
coming
up
against
i
suppose
it
your
destiny
said
bobby
you
always
say
it
to
teach
you
that
what
an
old
chap
i
knew
in
cornwall
said
but
why
ca
i
be
let
alone
how
i
loved
that
bit
last
year
when
the
fellows
liked
me
only
the
decent
things
never
it
be
all
right
later
bobby
answered
thinking
that
he
had
never
seen
anything
finer
than
the
way
peter
had
taken
that
afternoon
in
a
way
he
went
on
you
fellows
are
lucky
to
get
a
chance
of
standing
up
against
that
sort
of
thing
it
damned
good
practice
nobody
ever
thinks
i
worth
well
said
peter
throwing
a
clod
of
dark
scented
earth
into
the
air
and
losing
sight
of
it
in
the
black
wall
about
him
here
to
next
year
battle
chapter
vii
pride
of
life
i
peter
never
saw
dawson
again
when
the
summer
holidays
had
run
some
three
weeks
a
letter
arrived
stating
quite
simply
and
tersely
that
owing
to
the
by
evading
parents
of
bills
long
overdue
and
to
many
other
depressing
and
unavoidable
circumstances
barbour
and
that
house
of
cards
his
school
had
fallen
to
pieces
there
at
any
rate
was
an
end
to
that
disastrous
accumulation
of
brick
and
mortar
and
the
harm
that
living
it
had
wrought
upon
the
souls
and
bodies
of
its
victims
its
dying
could
not
excuse
no
tears
were
shed
for
dawson
peter
at
the
news
knew
that
now
his
battle
never
could
be
won
that
battle
at
any
rate
must
be
left
behind
him
with
his
defeat
written
large
upon
the
plain
of
it
and
this
made
in
some
unrealised
way
the
penalty
of
the
future
months
harder
to
bear
he
had
behind
him
defeat
look
at
it
as
he
might
he
had
been
a
failure
at
dawson
he
had
not
done
the
things
that
he
had
been
put
there
to
do
and
yet
through
the
disaster
he
knew
that
in
so
far
as
he
had
refused
to
bend
to
the
storm
so
far
there
had
been
victory
of
that
at
any
rate
he
was
sure
so
he
turned
resolutely
from
the
past
and
faced
the
future
it
was
as
though
suddenly
dawson
had
never
existed
a
dream
a
fantasy
a
delirium
something
that
had
left
no
external
things
behind
it
and
had
only
in
the
effect
that
it
had
worked
upon
himself
spiritually
made
its
mark
he
faced
his
house
scaw
house
had
seemed
to
him
during
these
last
three
years
merely
an
interlude
at
dawson
there
had
been
hurried
holidays
that
had
been
spent
in
recovering
from
and
preparing
for
the
term
and
the
house
had
scarcely
and
only
very
quietly
raised
its
head
to
disturb
him
he
had
not
been
disturbed
he
had
had
other
things
to
think
about
and
now
he
was
very
greatly
disturbed
indeed
that
was
the
first
difference
that
he
consciously
realised
the
disturbance
lay
of
course
partly
in
the
presence
of
his
father
and
in
the
sense
that
he
had
had
growing
upon
him
during
the
last
two
years
that
their
relationship
the
one
to
the
other
would
suddenly
one
fine
day
spring
into
acute
emotion
they
were
approaching
one
another
gradually
as
in
a
room
whose
walls
were
slowly
closing
face
to
face
and
then
body
to
body
at
last
soul
to
soul
he
did
not
he
thought
actively
hate
his
father
his
father
did
not
actively
hate
him
but
hate
might
spring
up
at
any
moment
between
them
and
peter
although
he
was
only
sixteen
was
no
longer
a
child
but
the
feeling
of
apprehension
that
scaw
house
gave
him
was
caused
by
wider
influences
than
his
father
three
years
at
dawson
had
given
peter
an
acute
sense
of
expecting
things
it
might
be
defined
as
the
glance
over
the
shoulder
to
see
who
followed
some
one
was
always
following
at
scaw
house
he
saw
in
this
how
closely
life
was
bound
together
because
every
little
moment
at
dawson
contributed
to
his
present
active
fear
dawson
explained
scaw
house
to
peter
and
yet
this
was
all
morbidity
and
peter
square
had
no
scrap
of
morbidity
in
his
clean
body
he
did
not
await
the
future
with
the
shaking
candle
of
the
suddenly
awakened
coward
but
rather
with
the
planted
feet
and
the
bared
teeth
of
the
he
watched
the
faces
of
his
father
his
aunt
and
trussit
he
observed
the
frightened
dreams
of
his
grandfather
the
way
that
old
curtis
the
gardener
would
suddenly
cease
his
fugitive
digging
and
glance
with
furtive
eyes
at
the
windows
of
the
house
about
them
were
the
dark
shadows
of
the
long
passages
the
sharp
note
of
some
banging
door
in
a
distant
room
the
wail
of
that
endless
wind
beyond
the
walls
he
felt
too
that
trussit
and
his
aunt
were
furtively
watching
him
he
never
caught
them
in
anything
tangible
but
he
knew
that
when
his
back
was
turned
their
eyes
followed
him
questioning
wondering
something
must
be
done
or
he
could
not
answer
for
his
control
if
he
were
not
to
return
to
dawson
what
then
it
was
his
seventeenth
birthday
one
hot
day
towards
the
end
of
august
and
at
breakfast
his
father
without
looking
up
from
his
paper
said
i
have
made
arrangements
for
you
with
aitchinson
to
enter
his
office
next
week
you
have
to
work
you
been
idling
long
the
windows
were
wide
open
the
lawn
was
burning
in
the
sun
bees
carried
the
scent
of
the
flowers
with
them
into
the
air
that
hung
like
shining
metal
about
the
earth
a
cart
rattled
as
though
it
were
a
giant
clattering
his
pleasure
at
the
day
down
the
road
it
was
a
wonderful
day
and
somewhere
streams
were
flowing
under
dark
protecting
trees
and
the
grass
was
thick
in
cool
hollows
and
the
woods
were
so
dense
that
no
blue
sky
reached
the
moss
but
only
the
softest
twilight
and
old
aitchinson
the
town
solicitor
with
his
nutcracker
face
his
snuffling
nose
his
false
teeth
and
the
office
the
piles
of
paper
the
ink
the
silly
view
from
the
dusty
windows
of
treliss
high
street
and
life
always
in
the
future
to
be
like
that
until
he
died
but
peter
showed
no
emotion
very
well
father
what
day
do
i
go
monday
nine
nothing
more
was
said
at
any
rate
aitchinson
and
his
red
tape
and
his
moral
dust
would
fill
the
day
no
time
then
to
dwell
on
these
dark
passages
and
trussit
frightened
eyes
and
the
startled
jump
of
the
marble
clock
in
the
just
before
it
struck
the
hour
ii
and
so
for
weeks
it
proved
aitchinson
demanded
no
serious
consideration
he
was
a
hideous
little
man
with
eyes
like
pins
shaggy
eyebrows
a
nose
that
swelled
at
the
end
and
was
pinched
by
the
sharpest
of
cheeks
that
hung
white
and
loose
except
when
he
was
hungry
or
angry
and
then
they
were
tight
and
red
a
little
body
rather
dandily
dressed
with
a
flowered
waistcoat
a
white
stock
a
skirted
coat
and
trousers
and
last
of
all
tiny
feet
of
which
he
was
inordinately
proud
and
with
which
like
agag
he
always
walked
delicately
he
had
a
high
falsetto
voice
fingers
that
were
always
picking
like
eager
hens
at
the
buttons
on
his
waistcoat
or
the
little
waxed
moustache
above
his
mouth
and
hair
that
occupied
its
time
in
covering
a
bald
patch
that
always
escaped
every
design
upon
it
so
much
for
aitchinson
let
him
be
flattered
sufficiently
and
peter
saw
that
his
way
would
be
easy
the
wizened
little
creature
had
moreover
a
certain
admiration
for
peter
strength
and
broad
shoulders
and
used
sometimes
in
the
middle
of
the
morning
work
to
ask
peter
how
much
he
weighed
whether
he
ever
considered
taking
up
as
a
profession
and
how
much
he
measured
across
the
chest
there
were
two
other
youths
articled
like
peter
stupid
sons
of
honest
treliss
householders
with
high
collars
faces
that
shone
with
soap
and
hair
that
glistened
with
oil
languid
voices
and
a
perpetual
fund
of
small
talk
about
the
ladies
of
the
town
moral
and
otherwise
peter
did
not
like
them
and
they
did
not
like
peter
one
day
because
he
was
tired
and
unhappy
he
knocked
their
heads
together
and
they
plotted
to
destroy
him
but
they
were
afraid
and
secretly
admired
what
they
called
his
coarse
habits
the
summer
stole
away
and
autumn
crept
into
its
place
and
at
the
end
of
october
something
occurred
something
suddenly
happened
at
scaw
house
that
made
action
imperative
and
filled
his
brain
all
day
so
that
aitchinson
office
and
his
work
there
was
only
a
dream
and
the
people
in
it
were
shadows
he
had
heard
his
mother
crying
from
behind
her
closed
door
he
had
been
coming
on
a
wet
autumnal
afternoon
down
the
dark
stairs
from
his
attic
and
suddenly
at
the
other
end
of
the
long
passage
there
had
been
this
sound
so
sudden
and
so
pitiful
coming
upon
that
dreary
stillness
that
he
had
stopped
with
his
hands
clenched
and
his
face
white
and
his
heart
beating
like
a
knock
on
a
door
instantly
all
those
many
little
moments
that
he
had
had
in
that
white
room
with
that
air
crowded
upon
him
and
he
remembered
the
smile
that
she
had
always
given
him
and
the
way
that
her
hair
lay
so
tragically
about
the
pillow
he
had
always
been
frightened
and
eager
to
escape
he
felt
suddenly
so
deeply
ashamed
that
the
crimson
flooded
his
face
there
in
the
dark
passage
she
had
wanted
him
all
these
years
and
he
had
allowed
those
other
people
to
prevent
him
from
going
to
her
what
had
been
happening
to
her
in
that
room
the
sound
of
her
crying
came
to
him
as
though
beseeching
him
to
come
and
help
her
he
put
his
hands
to
his
ears
and
went
desperately
into
the
dark
wet
garden
he
knew
now
when
he
thought
of
it
that
his
behaviour
to
his
mother
had
been
during
these
months
since
he
had
left
dawson
an
unconscious
cowardice
whilst
he
had
been
yet
at
school
those
little
five
minutes
visits
to
his
room
might
have
been
excused
but
during
these
last
months
there
had
been
with
regard
to
her
in
his
conscience
if
he
had
cared
to
examine
it
sharp
accusation
the
defence
that
she
did
not
really
want
to
see
him
that
his
presence
might
bring
on
some
bad
attack
might
excite
her
was
no
real
defence
he
had
postponed
an
interview
with
her
from
day
to
day
because
he
realised
that
that
interview
would
strike
into
flame
all
the
slumbering
relations
that
that
household
held
it
would
fling
them
all
as
though
from
a
preconcerted
signal
into
war
but
now
there
could
be
only
one
thought
in
his
mind
he
must
see
his
mother
if
he
could
still
help
her
he
must
be
at
her
service
there
was
no
one
whom
he
could
ask
about
her
trussit
now
never
spoke
to
him
and
indeed
never
spoke
to
any
one
if
she
could
help
it
and
went
up
and
down
the
stairs
in
her
rustling
black
and
flat
white
face
and
jingling
keys
as
though
she
was
no
human
being
at
all
but
only
a
walking
automaton
that
you
wound
up
in
the
morning
and
put
away
in
the
cupboard
at
night
trussit
was
of
no
use
there
remained
stephen
and
this
decided
peter
to
break
through
that
barrier
that
there
was
between
them
and
to
find
out
why
it
had
ever
existed
he
had
not
seen
stephen
that
summer
at
all
no
one
saw
stephen
only
at
the
bending
mule
they
shook
their
heads
over
him
and
spoke
of
the
wild
devil
that
had
come
upon
him
because
the
woman
he
loved
was
being
tortured
to
death
by
her
husband
only
a
mile
away
he
was
drinking
they
said
and
his
farm
was
going
to
ruin
and
he
would
speak
to
nobody
and
they
shook
their
heads
it
was
not
through
cowardice
that
peter
had
avoided
him
but
since
those
three
years
at
dawson
he
had
been
lonely
and
silent
himself
and
stephen
had
never
sent
for
him
as
he
would
have
done
peter
thought
if
he
had
wanted
him
now
the
time
had
come
when
he
could
stand
alone
no
longer
he
slipped
away
one
night
after
supper
leaving
that
quiet
room
with
his
aunt
playing
patience
at
the
table
his
old
grandfather
mumbling
in
his
sleep
his
father
like
a
stone
staring
at
his
paper
but
not
peter
was
sure
reading
any
of
it
trussit
silent
before
the
fire
in
her
room
his
aunt
not
seeing
the
cards
that
she
laid
upon
the
table
his
father
not
reading
his
paper
for
what
were
they
all
listening
it
was
a
fierce
night
and
the
wind
rushed
up
the
high
road
as
though
it
would
tear
peter
off
his
feet
and
fling
him
into
the
sea
but
he
walked
sturdily
no
cap
on
his
head
and
the
wind
streaming
through
his
hair
some
way
along
the
road
he
found
a
child
crying
in
a
ditch
he
loved
children
and
picking
the
small
boy
up
he
found
that
he
had
been
sent
for
beer
to
the
cap
and
feathers
at
the
turn
of
the
road
and
been
blown
by
the
wind
into
the
ditch
and
was
almost
dead
with
terror
at
first
at
the
sight
of
peter
the
child
had
cried
out
but
at
the
touch
of
his
warm
hand
and
at
the
sound
of
his
laugh
he
had
been
suddenly
comforted
and
trotted
down
the
road
with
his
hand
in
peter
and
his
tears
dried
peter
way
with
the
children
of
the
place
was
sharp
and
entirely
lacking
in
sentiment
little
idiot
to
fall
into
the
ditch
like
that
not
much
of
the
man
about
you
young
is
thomas
said
the
small
boy
with
a
chuckle
i
be
jan
proteroe
and
i
beant
afeart
only
gert
beast
come
out
of
hedge
down
along
with
eyes
and
a
tail
gum
he
would
have
told
peter
a
great
deal
more
but
he
was
suddenly
frightened
again
by
the
dark
hedges
and
began
to
whimper
so
peter
picked
him
up
and
carried
him
to
his
cottage
at
the
end
of
the
road
and
kissed
him
and
pushed
him
in
at
the
lighted
door
he
was
cheered
by
the
little
incident
and
felt
less
lonely
at
the
thought
of
making
stephen
once
more
his
friend
his
heart
warmed
stephen
had
been
wanting
him
perhaps
all
this
time
to
come
to
him
but
had
been
afraid
that
he
might
be
interfering
if
he
asked
him
and
how
glad
they
would
be
to
see
one
another
after
all
they
needed
one
another
they
had
both
had
hard
times
they
were
both
lonely
and
no
distance
nor
circumstances
could
lessen
that
early
bond
that
there
had
been
between
them
happier
than
he
had
been
for
many
weeks
he
struck
off
the
road
and
started
across
the
fields
stumbling
over
the
rough
soil
and
plunging
sometimes
into
ditches
and
pools
of
water
the
rain
had
begun
to
fall
and
the
whispering
hiss
that
it
made
as
it
struck
the
earth
drowned
the
more
distant
noise
of
the
sea
that
solemnly
broke
beyond
the
bending
fields
stephen
farm
stood
away
from
all
other
houses
and
peter
as
he
pressed
forward
seemed
to
be
leaving
all
civilisation
behind
him
he
was
cold
and
his
boots
were
heavy
with
thick
wet
mud
and
his
hair
was
soaked
beyond
the
fields
was
a
wood
through
which
he
must
pass
before
he
reached
stephen
farm
and
as
the
trees
closed
about
him
and
he
heard
the
rain
driving
through
the
bare
branches
the
world
seemed
to
be
full
of
chattering
noises
the
confidence
that
he
had
had
in
reception
of
him
suddenly
deserted
him
and
a
cold
miserable
unhappiness
crept
about
him
in
this
wet
heaving
world
of
wind
and
rain
and
bare
naked
trees
like
a
great
cry
there
seemed
to
come
suddenly
to
him
through
the
wood
his
mother
voice
appealing
for
help
so
that
he
nearly
turned
running
back
it
was
a
hard
cruel
place
this
world
and
all
the
little
ditches
and
hollows
of
the
wood
were
running
with
brown
stealthy
water
he
broke
through
it
at
last
and
saw
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
house
and
he
saw
that
there
were
no
lights
in
the
windows
he
stood
on
the
breast
of
the
little
hill
for
a
moment
and
thought
that
he
would
turn
back
but
it
was
raining
now
with
great
heaviness
and
the
wind
at
his
back
seemed
to
beat
him
down
the
hill
suddenly
seized
with
terror
at
the
wood
behind
him
he
ran
stumbling
down
the
slope
he
undid
the
gate
and
pitched
into
the
yard
plunging
into
great
pools
of
water
and
seeing
on
every
side
of
him
the
uncertain
shapes
of
the
barns
and
sheds
and
opposite
him
the
great
dark
front
of
the
house
so
black
in
its
unfriendliness
sharing
in
the
night
rough
hostility
he
shouted
stephen
but
his
voice
was
drowned
by
the
storm
and
the
gate
behind
him
creaking
on
its
hinges
answered
him
with
shrill
cries
he
found
the
little
wicket
that
led
into
the
garden
and
stepping
over
the
heavy
wet
grass
he
banged
loudly
with
the
knocker
on
the
door
and
called
again
the
noise
echoed
through
the
house
and
then
the
silence
seemed
to
be
redoubled
then
pushing
the
great
knocker
he
found
to
his
surprise
that
the
door
was
unfastened
and
swung
back
before
him
he
felt
his
way
into
the
dark
hall
and
struck
a
match
he
shouted
stephen
once
more
and
his
voice
came
echoing
back
to
him
the
place
seemed
to
be
entirely
deserted
the
walls
were
wet
with
damp
there
were
no
carpets
on
the
floor
a
window
at
the
end
of
the
passage
showed
its
uncurtained
square
he
passed
into
the
kitchen
and
here
he
found
two
candles
and
lighted
them
here
also
he
found
signs
of
life
on
the
bare
deal
table
was
a
meal
a
loaf
of
bread
cheese
butter
an
empty
whisky
bottle
lying
on
its
side
near
these
things
there
was
a
table
and
on
the
floor
beside
an
overturned
chair
there
was
a
gun
peter
picked
it
up
and
saw
that
it
was
unloaded
there
was
something
terribly
desolate
about
these
things
the
room
was
very
bare
a
grandfather
clock
ticked
solemnly
in
the
corner
there
were
a
few
plates
and
cups
on
the
dresser
an
old
calendar
hung
from
a
dusty
nail
and
blown
by
the
wind
from
the
cracked
window
like
a
stealthy
footstep
against
the
wall
but
peter
felt
curiously
certain
that
stephen
was
going
to
return
something
held
him
in
his
chair
and
he
sat
there
with
his
hands
on
the
deal
table
facing
the
clock
and
listening
the
wind
howled
beyond
the
house
the
rain
lashed
the
panes
and
suddenly
so
suddenly
that
his
heart
leapt
to
his
mouth
there
was
a
scratching
on
the
door
he
went
to
the
door
and
opened
it
and
found
outside
a
wretched
so
starved
that
the
bones
showed
through
the
skin
and
so
weak
that
he
could
scarcely
drag
himself
along
peter
let
him
in
and
the
animal
came
up
to
him
and
looked
up
in
his
eyes
and
very
faintly
wagged
his
tail
peter
gave
him
the
bread
which
the
dog
devoured
and
then
they
both
remained
silent
without
moving
the
dog
head
between
peter
knees
the
boy
must
have
slept
because
he
woke
suddenly
to
all
the
clocks
in
the
house
striking
midnight
and
in
the
silence
the
house
seemed
to
be
full
of
clocks
they
came
running
down
the
stairs
and
up
and
down
the
passages
and
then
with
a
whir
and
a
clatter
ceased
as
instantly
as
they
had
begun
the
house
was
silent
again
the
storm
had
died
down
and
then
the
dog
that
had
been
sleeping
suddenly
raised
its
head
and
barked
somewhere
in
the
distance
a
door
was
banged
to
and
then
peter
heard
a
voice
a
tremendous
voice
singing
there
were
heavy
steps
along
the
passage
then
the
kitchen
door
was
banged
open
and
stephen
stood
in
the
doorway
stephen
shirt
was
open
at
the
neck
his
hair
waved
wildly
over
his
forehead
he
stood
enormous
with
his
legs
apart
his
eyes
shining
blood
coming
from
a
cut
in
his
cheek
and
in
one
of
his
hands
was
a
thick
cudgel
standing
there
in
the
doorway
he
might
have
been
some
ancient
hercules
some
mighty
achilles
he
saw
peter
recognised
him
but
continued
a
kind
of
triumphal
hymn
that
he
was
singing
ho
master
peter
i
beat
him
i
battered
his
bloody
carcass
i
came
along
and
i
looked
in
at
the
winder
and
i
saw
a
of
i
left
the
winder
i
broke
the
glass
i
was
down
upon
the
dirty
and
chorus
i
battered
bloody
carcass
praise
be
the
lord
i
got
one
between
the
eyes
praise
be
i
him
square
in
the
jaw
and
the
blood
came
out
of
his
mouth
and
down
went
and
chorus
i
battered
bloody
carcass
there
she
was
cryin
in
the
corner
of
the
room
my
lovely
girl
and
there
was
blast

her
lovely
and
chorus
i
battered

and
i

eyes
and
i
got
one
on
lovely
nose
and
went
down
straight
afore
me
and
chorus
i
battered
bloody
carcass
peter
knew
that
it
must
be
samuel
burstead
to
whom
stephen
was
referring
and
he
too
as
he
listened
was
suddenly
filled
with
a
sense
of
glory
and
exultation
here
after
all
was
a
way
out
of
all
trouble
all
this
terror
of
the
past
weeks
here
too
was
an
end
to
all
stephen
morbid
condition
sitting
alone
by
himself
drinking
seeing
no
one
now
that
he
got
burstead
between
the
eyes
life
would
be
a
vigorous
decent
thing
once
more
stephen
stopped
his
hymn
and
came
and
put
his
arm
round
peter
neck

think
of
you

i

of

to

world
a
bit
and
to
come
back
one
day
when

and
then
in
peter
there
suddenly
leapt
to
life
a
sense
of
battle
of
glorious
combat
and
conflict
as
he
stood
there
in
the
bare
kitchen
he
and
stephen
there
under
the
light
of
the
jumping
candle
with
the
rain
beating
on
the
panes
the
trees
of
the
wood
bending
to
the
wind
he
was
seized
exalted
transformed
with
a
sense
of
the
vigour
the
adventure
the
surprising
energy
of
life
stephen
stephen
he
cried
it
glorious
by
god
i
wish
i
been
there
stephen
caught
him
by
the
arm
and
held
him
the
old
dog
came
from
under
the
table
and
wagged
his
tail
bless
my
soul
said
stephen
looking
at
him
all
these
weeks
been
forgetting
him
i
been
in
a
kind
of
dream
boy
a
kind
o
dream
why
did
i
before
lord
why
did
i
before
peter
at
the
word
thought
of
his
mother
yes
he
thought
with
clenched
teeth
i
go
for
them
chapter
viii
peter
and
his
mother
i
he
had
returned
over
the
heavy
fields
singing
to
a
moon
in
the
morning
when
he
woke
after
a
night
of
glorious
fantastic
dreams
and
saw
the
sun
beating
very
brightly
across
his
carpet
and
birds
singing
beyond
his
window
he
felt
still
that
same
exultation
it
seemed
to
him
as
he
sat
on
his
bed
with
the
sun
striking
his
face
that
last
night
he
had
been
brought
into
touch
with
a
vigour
that
challenged
all
the
mists
and
vapours
by
which
he
had
felt
himself
surrounded
that
was
the
way
that
now
he
would
face
them
looking
back
afterwards
he
was
to
see
that
that
evening
with
stephen
flung
him
on
to
all
the
events
that
so
rapidly
followed
moreover
above
all
the
sensation
of
the
evening
there
was
also
a
triumphant
recognition
of
the
fact
that
stephen
had
now
been
restored
to
him
he
might
never
see
him
again
but
they
were
friends
once
more
he
could
not
be
lonely
now
as
he
had
been
and
then
coming
out
of
the
town
into
the
dark
street
and
the
starlight
he
thought
that
he
recognised
a
square
form
walking
before
him
he
puzzled
his
brain
to
recall
the
connection
and
then
as
he
passed
zachary
tan
shop
the
figure
turned
in
and
showed
for
a
moment
his
face
it
was
that
strange
man
from
london
emilio
zanti
ii
it
seemed
to
peter
that
now
at
scaw
house
the
sense
of
expectation
that
had
been
with
them
all
during
the
last
weeks
was
charged
with
suspense
at
supper
that
night
his
aunt
burst
suddenly
into
tears
and
left
the
room
shortly
afterwards
his
father
also
without
a
word
got
up
from
the
table
and
went
upstairs
peter
was
left
alone
with
his
grandfather
the
old
man
sunk
beneath
his
pile
of
cushions
his
brown
skinny
hand
clenching
and
unclenching
above
the
rugs
was
muttering
to
himself
in
peter
himself
as
he
stood
there
by
the
fire
looking
down
on
the
old
man
there
was
tremendous
pity
he
had
never
felt
so
tenderly
towards
his
grandfather
before
it
was
perhaps
because
he
had
himself
grown
up
all
in
a
day
last
night
had
proved
that
one
was
grown
up
indeed
although
one
was
but
seventeen
but
it
proved
to
him
still
more
that
the
time
had
come
for
him
to
deal
with
the
situation
all
about
him
to
discover
the
thing
that
was
occupying
them
all
so
deeply
peter
bent
down
to
the
cushions
grandfather
what
the
matter
with
the
house
he
could
hear
faintly
beneath
the
rugs
something
about
hell
and
fire
and
poor
old
grandfather
what
the
matter
with
the
house
but
still
only
poor
old
man
poor
old
man
nobody
loves
him
nobody
loves
him
to
hell
with
the
lot
of
let
grizzle
in
hell
fire
oh
such
nasty
pains
for
a
poor
old
grandfather
what
the
matter
with
the
house
the
old
brown
hand
suddenly
stopped
clenching
and
unclenching
and
out
from
the
cushions
the
old
brown
head
with
its
few
hairs
and
its
parchment
face
poked
like
a
withered
hullo
boy
you
here
grandfather
what
the
matter
with
the
house
the
old
man
fingers
sharp
like
pins
drew
peter
close
to
him
boy
i
terribly
frightened
i
been
having
such
dreams
i
thought
i
was
dead
in
a
coffin
but
peter
whispered
in
his
ear
grandfather
tell
me
what
the
matter
with
every
one
here
the
old
man
eyes
were
suddenly
sharp
like
needles
ah
he
wants
to
know
that
does
he
he
found
out
something
at
last
has
he
know
what
they
were
about

at
it
in
here
boy
too
oh
yes
for
weeks
and
weeks

your
mother
that
what
my
son

doing
frightening
her
to
death
he
cruel
my
son
i
had
the
devil
once
and
now
he
got
hold
of
me
and
that
why
i
here
mind
you
boy
and
the
old
man
ringers
clutched
him
very
tightly
if
you
do
get
the
better
of
the
devil
you
be
just
like
me
one
of
these
days
so
he
be
my
son
one
day
just
like
me
and
then
be
your
turn
my
boy
oh
they
westcotts
oh
my
pains
oh
my
pains
oh
i
a
poor
old
man
poor
old
man
his
head
sunk
beneath
the
cushions
again
and
his
muttering
died
away
like
a
kettle
when
the
lid
has
been
put
on
to
it
peter
had
been
kneeling
so
as
to
catch
his
grandfather
words
now
he
drew
himself
up
and
with
frowning
brows
faced
the
room
had
he
but
known
it
he
was
at
that
moment
exactly
like
his
father
he
went
slowly
up
to
his
attic
his
little
had
gained
in
the
last
two
years
there
were
now
three
of
henry
galleon
novels
there
bobby
had
given
him
one
henry
lessingham
shining
bravely
in
its
red
and
gold
he
had
bought
another
the
downs
second
hand
and
it
was
rather
tattered
and
well
thumbed
another
the
roads
was
a
shilling
paper
copy
he
had
read
these
three
again
and
again
until
he
knew
them
by
heart
almost
word
by
word
he
took
down
henry
lessingham
now
and
opened
it
at
a
page
that
was
turned
down
it
is
book
iii
chapter
vi
and
there
is
this
passage
concerning
the
traveller
who
would
enter
the
house
of
courage
there
are
many
lands
that
must
be
passed
on
the
road
before
he
rest
there
there
is
first
the
land
of
lacking
all
things
that
is
hard
to
cross
there
is
secondly
the
land
of
having
all
things
there
is
the
traveller
fortitude
most
hardly
tested
there
is
thirdly
the
land
of
losing
all
those
things
that
one
hath
possessed
that
is
a
hard
country
indeed
for
the
memory
of
the
pleasantness
of
those
earlier
joys
redoubleth
the
agony
of
lacking
them
but
at
the
end
there
is
a
land
of
ice
and
snow
that
few
travellers
have
compassed
and
that
is
the
land
of
knowing
what
one
hath
missed
the
bird
was
in
the
hand
and
one
let
it
go
that
is
the
hardest
agony
of
all
the
journey
but
if
these
lands
be
encountered
and
surpassed
then
doth
the
traveller
at
length
possess
his
soul
and
is
master
of
it
this
is
the
meaning
and
purpose
of
peter
read
on
through
those
pages
where
lessingham
having
found
these
words
in
some
old
book
takes
courage
after
his
many
misadventures
and
starts
again
life
an
old
man
seventy
years
of
age
but
full
of
hope
and
then
there
is
his
wonderful
death
in
the
plague
city
closing
it
all
like
a
triumph
the
night
had
come
down
upon
the
house
over
the
moor
some
twinkling
light
broke
the
black
darkness
and
his
candle
blew
in
the
wind
everything
was
very
still
and
as
he
clutched
his
book
in
his
hand
he
knew
that
he
was
frightened
his
grandfather
words
had
filled
him
with
terror
he
felt
not
only
that
his
father
was
cruel
and
had
been
torturing
his
mother
for
many
years
because
he
loved
to
hurt
but
he
felt
also
that
it
was
something
in
the
blood
and
that
it
would
come
upon
him
also
in
later
years
and
that
he
might
not
be
able
to
beat
it
down
he
could
understand
definite
things
when
they
were
tangible
before
his
eyes
but
here
was
something
that
one
could
not
catch
hold
of
something
after
all
he
was
very
young
but
he
remembered
with
bated
breath
times
at
school
when
he
had
suddenly
wanted
to
twist
arms
to
break
things
to
hurt
when
suddenly
a
fierce
hot
pleasure
had
come
upon
him
when
a
boy
had
had
his
leg
broken
at
football
dropping
the
book
shuddering
he
fell
upon
his
knees
and
prayed
to
what
god
he
knew
not
then
doth
the
traveller
at
length
possess
his
soul
and
is
master
of
it
this
is
the
meaning
and
purpose
of
at
last
he
rose
from
his
knees
physically
tired
as
though
it
had
been
some
physical
struggle
but
he
was
quiet
again
the
terror
had
left
him
but
he
knew
now
with
what
beasts
he
had
got
to
wrestle
at
supper
that
night
he
watched
his
father
curiously
after
his
struggle
of
the
afternoon
all
terror
had
left
him
and
he
felt
as
though
he
was
of
his
father
age
and
strength
in
the
middle
of
the
meal
he
spoke
how
is
mother
father
he
had
never
asked
about
his
mother
before
but
his
voice
was
quite
even
and
steady
his
aunt
dropped
her
knife
clattering
on
to
her
plate
his
father
answered
him
why
do
you
wish
to
know
it
is
natural
is
it
i
am
afraid
that
she
is
not
so
she
is
as
well
as
can
be
they
said
no
more
but
once
his
father
suddenly
looked
at
him
as
though
he
had
noticed
some
new
note
in
his
voice
iii
on
the
next
afternoon
his
father
went
into
truro
a
doctor
came
occasionally
to
the
house
a
little
man
like
a
beaver
but
peter
felt
that
he
was
under
his
father
hand
and
he
despised
him
it
was
a
clear
autumn
afternoon
with
a
scent
of
burning
leaves
in
the
air
and
heavy
massive
white
clouds
were
piled
in
ramparts
beyond
the
brown
hills
it
was
so
still
a
day
that
the
sea
seemed
to
be
murmuring
just
beyond
the
the
house
was
very
silent
trussit
was
in
the
housekeeper
room
his
grandfather
was
sleeping
in
the
the
voices
of
some
children
laughing
in
the
road
came
to
him
so
clearly
that
it
seemed
to
peter
impossible
that
his
father
and
at
that
he
knew
instantly
that
his
chance
had
come
he
must
see
his
mother
now
there
might
not
be
another
opportunity
for
many
weeks
he
left
his
room
and
stood
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
listening
there
was
no
sound
he
stole
down
very
softly
and
then
waited
again
at
the
end
of
the
long
passage
the
ticking
of
the
grandfather
clock
in
the
hall
drove
him
down
the
passage
he
listened
again
outside
his
mother
door
there
was
no
sound
from
within
and
very
slowly
he
turned
the
handle
as
the
door
opened
his
senses
were
invaded
by
that
air
of
medicine
and
flowers
that
he
had
remembered
as
a
very
small
boy
he
seemed
to
be
surrounded
by
it
and
great
white
vases
on
the
mantelpiece
filled
his
eyes
and
the
white
curtains
at
the
window
blew
in
the
breeze
of
the
opening
door
his
aunt
was
sitting
with
her
eternal
sewing
by
the
fire
and
she
rose
as
he
entered
she
gave
a
little
startled
cry
like
a
twittering
bird
as
she
saw
that
it
was
he
and
she
came
towards
him
with
her
hand
out
he
did
not
look
at
the
bed
at
all
but
bent
his
eyes
gravely
upon
his
aunt
please
aunt
you
must
leave
us
i
want
to
speak
to
my
no
peter
how
could
you
i
dare
i
must
your
father
your
mother
is
asleep
and
then
from
behind
them
there
came
a
very
soft
voice
no
let
us
be
alone
please
peter
did
not
even
then
turn
round
to
the
bed
but
fixed
his
eyes
on
his
aunt
the
doctor
she
gasped
and
then
with
frightened
eyes
she
picked
up
her
sewing
and
crept
out
then
he
turned
round
and
faced
the
bed
and
was
suddenly
smitten
with
great
shyness
at
the
sight
of
that
white
tired
face
and
the
black
hair
about
the
pillow
well
mother
he
said
stupidly
but
she
smiled
back
at
him
and
although
her
voice
was
very
small
and
faint
she
spoke
cheerfully
and
as
though
this
were
an
ordinary
event
well
you
come
to
see
me
at
last
peter
she
said
i
must
stay
long
he
answered
gruffly
as
he
moved
awkwardly
towards
the
bed
bring
your
chair
close
up
to
the
bed
so
like
that
you
have
never
come
to
sit
in
here
before
peter
do
you
know
that
yes
he
turned
his
eyes
away
and
looked
on
to
the
floor
you
have
come
in
before
because
you
have
been
told
to
you
were
not
told
why
did
you
come
i
do
know
father
in
yes
i
he
thought
he
caught
for
an
instant
a
strange
note
in
her
voice
but
he
will
not
be
back
there
was
a
pause
a
vast
golden
cloud
hung
like
some
mountain
boulder
beyond
the
window
and
some
of
its
golden
light
seemed
to
steal
over
the
white
room
is
it
bad
for
you
talking
to
me
at
last
he
said
gruffly
ought
i
to
go
away
suddenly
she
clutched
his
strong
brown
hand
with
her
thin
wasted
fingers
with
so
convulsive
a
grasp
that
his
heart
began
to
beat
furiously
no
do
go
not
until
it
is
time
for
your
father
to
come
back
it
strange
that
after
all
these
years
this
is
the
first
time
that
we
should
have
a
talk
oh
so
many
times
i
wanted
you
to
come
and
when
you
come
when
you
were
very
little
you
were
always
so
frightened
that
you
would
not
let
me
touch
you
frightened
me

last

a
little
time

talk
quickly

want
you
to
tell
me
everything

let
me
look
at
you
she
took
his
head
between
her
pale
slender
hands
and
looked
at
him
oh

like
him

father
wonderfully
she
lay
back
on
the
pillows
with
a
little
sigh

to
be
strong
for
you
now

going
to
look
after

she
shook
her
head
almost
gaily
at
him

too

after
all
these
years

and
i
was
never
strong
enough
to
say
that
you
must
come
and
they
said
that
you
were
noisy
and
it
would
be
bad
for
me
but
i
believe
if
you
had
come
earlier
i
might
have
but
you
must
die

happy
at
last
she
stroked
his
cheek
with
her
hand
the
golden
light
from
the
great
cloud
filled
the
room
and
touched
the
white
vases
with
its
colour
but
quick
quick
tell
me
there
are
so
many
things
and
there
is
so
little
time
i

school
here
when
you
were
little
all
of
it
but
he
was
gripping
the
bed
with
his
hands
his
chest
was
heaving
suddenly
he
broke
down
and
burying
his
head
in
the
began
to
sob
as
though
his
heart
would
break
oh
now
after
all
this
time
you
wanted
me
and
i
never
came
and
now
to
find
you
like
this
she
stroked
his
hair
very
softly
and
waited
until
the
sobs
ceased
he
sat
up
and
fiercely
brushed
his
eyes
i
wo
be
a
fool
any
more
it
sha

too
late

make
you

he
stared
at
the
golden
cloud
to
be
a
novelist
i
daresay
i
ca
i
do
know
but
i
rather
do
that
than

father

solicitor

aitchinson

he
turned
almost
fiercely

from

window

courage

up
against

stronger
woman

have
got
the
better
of
it
i
expect
but
i
was
always
like
this
she
added
laughing
a
little
far
away
ghost
of
a
laugh
go
and
look
in
that
drawer
there
in
that
cupboard
amongst
my
handkerchiefs
there
where
those
old
fans
are
you
find
some
old
programmes
there
those
old
yellow
papers
he
brought
them
to
her
three
old
yellow
programmes
of
a
concert
given
at
the
town
hall
there
do
you
see
miss
minnie
trenowth
in
the
gloaming
there
i
sang
in
those
days
oh
truro
was
fun
when
i
was
a
girl
there
was
always
something
going
on
you
see
i
was
always
on
my
back
he
crushed
the
papers
in
his
hand
but
mother
if
you
were
like
that
then
what
made
you
like
this
now
it
nerves

stupid

has
he
treated

years

father

always
been
very
mother
tell
me
the
truth
i
know
has
he
been
kind
to
you
yes
dear
but
her
voice
was
very
faint
and
that
look
that
peter
had
noticed
before
was
again
in
her
eyes
mother
you
must
tell
me
that
not
yes
peter
he
done
his
best
i
have
been
annoying
sometimes
mother
i
know
i
know
because
i
know
father
and
i
know
myself
like
him
i
just
found
it
out
i
got
those
same
things
in
me
and
they
do
for
me
if
i
do
get
the
better
of
them
grandfather
told
me
he
was
the
same
all
the
westcotts
he
bent
over
the
bed
and
took
her
hand
and
kissed
it
mother
dear
i
know
father
has
been
frightening
you
all
this
time
terrifying
you
and
you
were
all
alone
if
only
i
had
been
there
if
only
there
had
been
some
one
her
voice
was
very
faint
yes
he
has
frightened
me
all
these
years
at
first
i
used
to
think
that
he
did
mean
it
i
was
a
bright
merry
sort
of
a
girl
then
careless
and
knowing
nothing
about
the
world
and
then
i
began
to
see
that
he
liked
it
that
it
gave
him
pleasure
to
have
something
there
that
he
could
hurt
and
then
i
began
to
be
frightened
it
was
very
lonely
here
for
a
girl
who
had
had
a
gay
time
and
he
to
like
my
going
to
truro
and
at
last
he
even
stopped
my
seeing
people
in
treliss
and
then
i
began
to
be
really
frightened
and
used
to
wake
in
the
night
and
see
him
standing
by
the
door
watching
me
then
i
thought
that
when
you
were
born
that
would
draw
us
together
but
it
did
and
i
was
always
ill
after
that
he
would
do
things
oh
her
hand
pressed
her
mouth
peter
dear
you
must
think
about
it
only
when
i
am
dead
i
do
want
you
to
think
that
i
was
quite
a
fool
if
they
tell
you
so
i
do
want
you
to
think
it
was
all
his
fault
either
because
it
was
i
was
silly
and
did
understand
sometimes
but
it
killed
me
that
dreadful
waiting
for
him
to
do
something
i
never
knew
what
it
would
be
and
sometimes
it
was
nothing
but
i
knew
that
he
liked
to
hurt
and
it
was
the
in
that
white
room
now
flaming
with
the
fires
of
the
setting
sun
peter
caught
his
mother
to
his
breast
and
held
her
there
and
her
white
hands
clutched
his
knees
then
his
eyes
softened
and
he
turned
to
her
and
arranged
her
head
on
the
pillow
and
drew
the
sheets
closely
about
her
i
must
go
now
it
has
been
bad
for
you
this
talking
but
it
had
to
be
i
never
never
going
to
leave
you
again
you
shall
not
be
alone
any
more
oh
peter
i
so
happy
i
have
never
been
so
happy
but
it
all
comes
of
being
a
coward
if
i
had
only
been
brave
never
be
afraid
of
anybody
or
anything
promise
me
peter
except
of
myself
he
answered
kissing
her
kiss
me
again
and
again
he
looked
back
at
her
smiling
he
saw
her
for
an
instant
as
he
left
the
room
with
her
cheek
against
the
pillow
and
her
black
hair
like
a
cloud
about
her
the
twilight
was
already
in
the
room
an
hour
later
as
he
stood
in
the
the
door
opened
and
his
father
came
in
you
have
been
with
your
mother
you
have
done
her
much
harm
she
is
i
know
everything
peter
answered
looking
him
in
the
face
iv
he
would
never
until
his
own
end
had
come
forget
that
evening
the
golden
sunset
gave
place
to
a
cold
and
windy
night
and
the
dark
clouds
rolled
up
along
the
grey
sky
hiding
and
then
revealing
the
thin
and
pallid
moon
peter
stayed
there
in
the
waiting
his
grandfather
slept
in
his
chair
once
his
aunt
came
crying
into
the
room
and
wandered
aimlessly
about
aunt
how
is
she
oh
dear
oh
dear
whatever
shall
i
do
she
is
going
she
is
going
i
can
do
nothing
her
thin
body
in
the
dusk
flitted
like
a
ghost
about
the
room
and
then
she
was
gone
the
doctor
pony
cart
came
rattling
up
to
the
door
the
fussy
little
man
got
out
and
stamped
in
the
hall
and
then
disappeared
upstairs
there
was
a
long
pause
during
which
there
was
no
sound
then
the
door
was
opened
and
his
aunt
was
there
you
must
come
at
once
she
wants
the
doctor
his
father
and
trussit
were
there
in
the
room
but
he
was
only
conscious
of
the
great
white
bed
with
the
candles
about
it
and
the
white
vases
like
eyes
watching
him
as
he
entered
the
room
there
was
a
faint
cry
he
had
crossed
to
her
and
her
arms
were
about
his
shoulders
and
her
mouth
was
pressed
against
his
she
fell
back
with
a
little
sigh
dead
v
in
the
darkened
later
his
father
stood
in
the
doorway
with
a
candle
in
his
hand
and
above
it
his
white
face
and
short
black
hair
shone
as
though
carved
from
marble
peter
came
from
the
window
towards
him
his
father
said
you
killed
her
by
going
to
peter
answered
all
these
years
you
have
been
killing
her
chapter
ix
the
three
westcotts
i
the
day
crept
strangely
and
mysteriously
to
its
close
peter
dulled
by
misery
sat
opposite
his
grandfather
in
the
without
moving
conscious
of
the
heavy
twilight
that
the
dark
blinds
flung
about
the
room
feeling
the
silence
that
was
only
accentuated
by
the
old
uneasy
in
his
sleep
and
the
clock
regular
ticking
the
unhappiness
that
had
been
gradually
growing
about
him
since
his
last
term
at
dawson
was
now
all
about
him
with
the
strength
and
horrible
appearance
of
some
unholy
giant
it
was
indeed
with
some
consciousness
of
things
that
were
flinging
their
shadows
on
the
horizon
and
were
not
as
yet
fully
visible
to
him
that
he
sat
there
that
evening
at
farm
realised
only
faintly
at
the
time
hung
before
him
now
as
a
vivid
induction
or
prologue
to
the
later
terrors
he
was
doomed
so
he
felt
in
that
darkened
and
mysterious
room
to
a
terrible
time
and
horrors
were
creeping
upon
him
from
every
side
went
his
grandfather
beneath
the
rugs
as
the
cactus
plant
rattled
in
the
window
and
the
silence
through
the
stairs
and
passages
of
the
house
crept
in
folds
about
the
room
peter
shivered
the
coals
fell
from
a
dull
gold
into
grey
and
crumbling
ashes
he
shut
everything
in
the
surrounding
world
from
his
mind
and
thought
of
his
dead
mother
there
indeed
there
was
strangeness
enough
for
it
seemed
now
that
that
wonderful
afternoon
had
filled
also
all
the
earlier
years
of
his
life
it
seemed
to
him
now
that
there
had
never
been
a
time
when
he
had
not
known
her
and
talked
with
her
and
yet
with
this
was
also
a
consciousness
of
all
the
joys
that
he
had
missed
because
he
had
not
known
her
before
as
he
thought
of
it
the
hard
irretrievable
fact
of
those
earlier
empty
years
struck
him
physically
with
a
sharp
agonising
pain
toothache
and
no
possible
way
of
healing
it
the
irony
of
her
proximity
of
her
desire
for
him
as
he
all
unwittingly
had
in
reality
desired
her
hit
him
like
a
blow
the
picture
of
her
waiting
told
that
he
did
not
wish
to
come
looking
so
sadly
and
lonely
in
that
white
room
whilst
he
on
the
other
side
of
that
door
had
not
the
courage
to
burst
through
those
others
and
go
to
her
broke
suddenly
the
hard
dry
passivity
that
had
held
him
during
so
many
weeks
he
was
very
young
he
was
very
tired
he
was
very
lonely
he
sobbed
with
his
hands
pressed
against
his
eyes
then
his
tears
were
quickly
dried
there
was
this
other
thing
to
be
considered
his
father
he
hated
his
father
he
was
terrified
as
he
sat
there
at
the
fury
with
which
he
hated
him
the
sudden
assurance
of
his
hatred
reminded
him
of
the
thing
that
his
grandfather
had
said
about
the
westcotts
was
that
true
and
was
this
intensity
of
emotion
that
filled
all
the
veins
in
his
body
a
sign
that
he
too
was
a
westcott
and
were
his
father
and
grandfather
mirrors
of
his
own
future
years
he
did
not
know
that
was
another
question
he
wondered
what
they
were
about
in
the
room
where
his
mother
lay
and
it
was
curious
that
the
house
could
remain
silent
during
so
many
long
hours
it
seemed
held
by
the
command
of
some
strong
power
and
his
mind
overstrained
and
abnormal
waited
for
some
outbreak
of
noise
many
noises
clattering
banging
whistling
through
the
house
but
his
grandfather
slept
on
no
step
was
on
the
stairs
the
room
was
very
dark
and
evening
fell
beyond
the
long
windows
and
over
the
sea
his
youth
made
of
a
day
eternity
there
was
no
end
nor
term
to
his
love
to
his
hatred
to
his
loneliness
to
his
utter
misery
and
also
he
was
afraid
he
would
have
given
his
world
for
stephen
but
stephen
was
already
off
on
his
travels
very
softly
and
stealthily
the
door
opened
and
holding
a
quivering
candle
with
her
finger
to
her
mouth
there
appeared
his
aunt
he
looked
at
her
coldly
as
she
came
across
the
room
towards
him
he
had
never
felt
any
affection
for
her
because
she
had
always
seemed
to
him
weak
and
useless
a
frightened
miserable
vacillating
negative
person
even
when
he
had
been
a
very
small
boy
he
had
despised
her
her
eyes
were
red
and
swollen
with
crying
her
grey
and
scanty
hair
had
fallen
about
her
collar
her
old
black
blouse
was
unbuttoned
at
the
top
showing
her
bony
neck
and
her
thin
crooked
hands
were
trembling
in
the
her
eyes
were
large
and
frightened
and
her
back
was
bent
as
though
she
was
cowering
from
a
blow
she
had
never
taken
very
much
notice
of
her
nephew
of
late
she
had
been
afraid
of
him
he
was
surprised
now
that
she
should
come
to
speak
to
him
peter
she
said
in
a
whisper
looking
back
over
her
shoulder
at
the
door
yes
he
answered
staring
at
her
oh
peter
she
said
again
and
began
to
cry
a
whimpering
noise
and
her
hands
shaking
so
that
the
candle
rocked
in
its
stick
well
he
said
more
softly
you
better
put
that
candle
she
put
it
on
the
table
and
then
stood
beside
him
crying
pitifully
jerking
out
little
sentences
i
ca
bear
it
i
do
know
what
to
do
i
ca
bear
he
got
up
from
his
chair
and
made
her
sit
down
on
it
and
then
he
stood
by
her
and
waited
until
she
should
recover
a
little
he
felt
suddenly
strangely
tender
towards
her
she
was
his
mother
sister
she
had
known
his
mother
all
her
life
and
perhaps
in
her
weak
silly
way
she
had
loved
her
no
aunt
do
cry
it
will
be
all
right
i
too
am
very
unhappy
i
have
missed
so
much
if
i
had
only
known
earlier
the
poor
woman
flung
little
distracted
glances
at
the
old
man
asleep
on
the
other
side
of
the
oh
dear
i
had
to
come
and
talk
to
some
one
i
was
so
frightened
upstairs
your
father
there
with
your
mother
he
sits
looking
at
her
and
she
was
always
so
quiet
and
good
and
never
did
him
any
harm
or
indeed
any
one
and
now
he
sits
looking
at
her
but
she
happy
now
he
will
be
coming
downstairs
at
any
moment
and
i
am
afraid
of
what
he
do
if
he
sees
me
talking
to
you
like
this
but
i
feel
as
though
i
must
talk
a
little
it
so
it
all
right
aunt
there
no
one
to
be
frightened
of
i
am
very
unhappy
too
i
like
to
talk
about
her
to
no
no
your
poor
mother
i
must
say
anything
they
be
down
upon
me
if
i
say
anything
they
very
sharp
he
sitting
up
with
her
peter
drew
another
chair
up
close
to
her
and
took
her
thin
hand
in
his
she
allowed
him
to
do
what
he
would
and
seemed
to
have
no
active
knowledge
of
her
surroundings
we
talk
about
her
he
said
often
you
shall
tell
me
all
about
her
early
life
i
want
to
know
oh
no
i
going
away
directly
after
the
funeral
directly
after
the
funeral
i
going
suddenly
this
frightened
him
was
he
to
be
left
here
entirely
alone
with
his
father
and
grandfather
you
going
away
he
said
oh
yes
your
uncle
jeremy
will
come
for
the
funeral
i
shall
go
away
with
him
afterwards
i
do
like
your
aunt
agatha
but
they
always
said
i
could
come
to
them
when
your
mother
died
i
do
like
your
aunt
agatha
but
she
means
to
be
kind
oh
i
could
stay
here
after
all
that
has
happened
i
was
only
staying
for
your
mother
sake
and
i
sure
i
never
gone
to
bed
without
wondering
what
would
happen
before
the
morning
oh
yes
your
uncle
jeremy
coming
and
i
shall
go
away
with
him
after
the
funeral
i
do
like
your
aunt
agatha
but
i
could
stay
after
all
that
has
all
this
was
said
in
a
hurried
frightened
whisper
the
poor
lady
shook
from
head
to
foot
and
the
little
bracelets
on
her
trembling
wrists
jangled
together
then
i
shall
be
all
alone
here
peter
said
suddenly
staring
at
the
candle
that
was
guttering
in
the
breeze
that
came
from
behind
the
heavy
blinds
oh
dear
said
his
aunt
i
sure
uncle
jeremy
will
be
kind
if
you
have
to
leave
here
you
why
should
i
have
to
leave
here
asked
peter
his
aunt
sunk
her
voice
very
low
indeed
so
low
that
it
seemed
to
come
from
the
heart
of
the
cactus
plant
by
the
window
he
has
got
your
mother
now
you
know
he
want
to
have
somebody
but
she
said
nothing
more
only
gazed
at
the
old
man
opposite
her
with
staring
eyes
and
cried
in
a
little
desolate
whimper
and
jangled
her
bracelets
until
at
last
peter
crept
softly
miserably
to
bed
ii
the
day
of
the
funeral
was
a
day
of
high
wind
and
a
furious
sea
the
westcotts
lived
in
the
parish
of
the
strange
wild
clergyman
whose
church
looked
over
the
sea
strange
and
wild
in
the
eyes
of
treliss
because
he
was
a
giant
in
size
and
had
a
long
flowing
beard
because
he
kept
a
perfect
menagerie
of
animals
in
his
little
house
by
the
church
and
because
he
talked
in
such
an
odd
wild
way
about
god
being
in
the
sea
and
the
earth
rather
than
in
the
hearts
of
the
treliss
citizens
all
these
things
odd
enough
and
sometimes
early
in
the
morning
he
might
be
seen
going
down
the
path
to
the
sea
to
bathe
which
was
hardly
decent
considering
his
great
size
and
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
the
high
road
to
those
who
remonstrated
he
had
said
that
he
was
not
ashamed
of
his
body
and
that
god
was
worshipped
the
better
for
there
being
no
clothing
to
keep
the
wind
away
all
mad
enough
and
there
were
never
many
parishioners
in
the
little
hill
church
of
a
sunday
however
it
was
in
the
little
windy
churchyard
that
westcott
was
buried
and
it
was
up
the
steep
and
stony
road
to
the
little
church
that
the
hearse
and
its
nodding
plumes
followed
by
the
two
old
and
decrepit
hackney
carriages
slowly
climbed
peter
impressions
of
the
day
were
vague
and
uncertain
there
were
things
that
always
remained
in
his
memory
but
strangely
his
general
conviction
was
that
his
mother
had
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
the
black
coffin
conveyed
nothing
to
him
of
her
presence
he
saw
her
as
he
had
seen
her
on
that
day
when
he
had
talked
to
her
and
now
she
was
as
stephen
was
somewhere
away
that
was
his
impression
that
she
had
escaped
putting
on
his
black
clothes
in
the
morning
brought
dawson
back
to
his
mind
and
especially
bobby
galleon
and
cards
he
had
not
thought
of
them
since
the
day
of
his
return
first
stephen
and
then
his
mother
had
driven
them
from
his
mind
but
now
with
the
old
school
black
clothing
upon
him
he
stood
for
a
long
time
by
his
window
wondering
sorrowfully
enough
where
they
were
and
what
they
were
doing
whether
they
had
forgotten
him
whether
he
would
ever
see
them
again
he
seemed
to
be
surrounded
by
a
wall
of
loneliness
some
one
was
cutting
everything
off
from
him
from
maliciousness
for
pleasure
oh
if
one
only
knew
about
that
god
meanwhile
uncle
jeremy
and
aunt
agatha
had
arrived
the
night
before
uncle
jeremy
was
big
and
stout
and
he
wore
clothes
that
were
very
black
and
extremely
bright
his
face
was
crimson
in
colour
and
his
eyes
large
and
bulging
wore
a
look
of
perpetual
surprise
he
was
bald
and
an
enormous
gold
watch
chain
crossed
his
stomach
like
a
bridge
he
had
obviously
never
cared
for
either
of
his
sisters
and
he
always
shouted
when
he
spoke
aunt
agatha
was
round
and
fat
and
comfortable
wore
spectacles
and
a
black
silk
dress
and
obviously
considered
that
uncle
jeremy
had
made
the
world
peter
watched
his
father
attitude
to
these
visitors
he
realised
that
he
had
never
seen
his
father
with
any
stranger
or
visitor
no
one
came
to
the
house
and
he
had
never
been
into
the
town
with
his
father
with
this
realisation
came
a
knowledge
of
other
things
of
things
half
heard
at
the
office
of
half
looks
in
the
street
of
a
deliberate
avoidance
of
his
father
name
the
westcotts
of
scaw
house
there
were
clouds
about
the
name
but
his
father
in
contact
with
uncle
jeremy
and
aunt
agatha
was
strangely
impressive
his
square
body
clothed
in
black
his
dark
eyes
his
short
stiff
hair
his
high
white
forehead
his
long
beautiful
hands
this
was
no
ordinary
man
moving
so
silently
with
a
reserve
that
seemed
nobly
fitting
on
this
sad
occasion
the
dark
figure
filled
the
house
touching
in
its
restrained
grief
admirable
in
its
dignity
a
fine
spirit
against
the
common
clay
of
uncle
jeremy
and
aunt
agatha
westcott
was
courteous
but
sparing
of
words
a
strong
man
you
would
say
bowed
down
with
a
grief
that
demanded
in
its
intensity
silence
uncle
jeremy
hated
and
feared
his
his
hatred
he
concealed
with
difficulty
but
his
fear
was
betrayed
by
his
loud
and
nervous
laugh
he
was
obviously
interested
in
peter
and
stared
at
him
throughout
breakfast
with
his
large
surprised
eyes
peter
felt
that
this
interest
was
a
speculation
as
to
his
future
and
it
made
him
uncomfortable
he
hated
his
uncle
but
the
black
suit
that
the
stout
gentleman
wore
on
the
day
of
the
funeral
was
so
black
so
tight
and
so
shiny
that
he
was
an
occasion
for
laughter
rather
than
hatred
the
black
coffin
was
brought
down
the
long
stairs
through
the
hall
and
into
the
desolate
garden
the
sight
of
it
roused
no
emotion
in
peter
was
not
his
mother
the
two
aunts
uncle
jeremy
and
his
father
rode
in
the
first
carriage
peter
and
trussit
in
the
second
trussit
bonnet
and
black
silk
dress
were
very
fine
and
she
wept
bitterly
throughout
the
journey
peter
only
dismally
wished
that
he
could
arrange
his
knees
so
that
they
would
not
rub
against
her
black
silk
he
did
not
think
of
his
mother
at
all
but
only
of
the
great
age
of
the
cab
of
the
furious
wind
that
whistled
about
the
road
and
the
roar
that
the
sea
grey
and
furious
far
below
them
flung
against
their
windows
he
would
have
liked
to
talk
to
her
but
her
sobbing
seemed
to
surround
her
with
a
barrier
it
was
all
inexpressibly
dreary
with
the
driving
wind
the
rustling
of
the
black
silk
dress
the
jolting
and
clattering
of
the
old
carriage
but
he
had
no
desire
to
cry
he
was
too
miserable
for
that
on
the
hill
in
the
little
churchyard
a
tempest
of
wind
swept
across
the
graves
from
the
bending
ground
the
cliff
fell
sheer
to
the
sea
and
behold
it
was
a
tossing
furious
carpet
of
white
and
grey
the
wind
blew
the
spray
up
to
the
graveyard
and
stung
the
faces
of
the
mourners
and
in
the
roar
of
the
waves
it
was
hard
to
hear
the
voice
of
the
preacher
it
was
a
picture
that
they
made
out
there
in
the
graveyard
poor
aunt
jessie
trembling
and
shaking
trussit
stout
and
stiff
with
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
uncle
jeremy
with
his
legs
apart
his
face
redder
than
ever
obviously
wishing
the
thing
over
aunt
agatha
concerned
for
her
clothes
in
the
streaming
wind
westcott
unmoved
by
the
storm
cold
stern
of
a
piece
with
the
grey
stone
at
the
gravehead
all
these
figures
interesting
enough
but
towering
above
them
and
dominating
the
scene
was
the
clergyman
his
great
beard
streaming
his
surplice
blowing
behind
him
in
a
cloud
his
great
voice
dominating
the
tumult
to
peter
he
was
a
part
of
the
day
the
storm
the
earth
the
flying
scudding
clouds
all
big
things
there
and
somewhere
sailing
with
those
clouds
on
the
storm
the
spirit
of
his
mother
that
little
black
coffin
standing
surely
for
nothing
that
mattered
but
strangely
enough
when
the
black
box
had
been
lowered
at
the
sharp
rattling
of
the
sods
upon
the
lid
his
sorrow
leapt
to
his
eyes
suddenly
the
sense
of
his
loss
drove
down
upon
him
the
place
the
people
were
swept
away
he
could
hear
her
voice
again
see
her
thin
white
hands
he
wanted
her
so
badly
if
he
could
only
have
his
chance
again
he
could
have
flung
himself
there
upon
the
coffin
not
caring
whether
he
lived
or
died
his
whole
being
soul
and
body
ached
for
her
he
knew
that
it
was
all
over
he
broke
away
from
them
all
and
he
never
afterwards
could
tell
where
it
was
that
he
wandered
during
the
rest
of
that
day
at
last
when
it
was
dark
he
crept
back
to
the
house
utterly
absolutely
exhausted
in
every
part
of
his
body
worn
out
iii
on
the
following
day
uncle
jeremy
and
aunt
agatha
departed
and
took
aunt
jessie
with
them
she
had
the
air
of
being
led
away
into
captivity
and
seemed
to
be
fastened
to
the
buttons
of
uncle
jeremy
tight
black
suit
she
said
nothing
further
to
peter
and
showed
no
sense
of
having
at
any
time
been
confidential
she
avoided
him
he
thought
he
of
course
returned
to
his
office
and
tried
to
bury
himself
in
the
work
that
he
found
there
but
his
attention
wandered
he
was
overstrung
excited
abnormally
so
that
the
whole
world
stood
to
him
as
a
strange
unnatural
picture
something
seen
dimly
and
in
exaggerated
shapes
through
coloured
glass
that
evening
with
stephen
shone
upon
him
now
with
all
the
vigour
of
colour
of
a
real
fact
in
a
multitude
of
vague
shadows
the
reality
of
that
night
was
now
of
the
utmost
value
meanwhile
there
were
changes
at
scaw
house
trussit
had
vanished
a
few
days
after
the
funeral
no
one
said
anything
about
her
departure
and
peter
did
not
see
her
go
he
was
vaguely
sorry
because
she
represented
in
his
memory
all
the
earlier
years
and
because
her
absence
left
the
house
even
darker
and
more
gloomy
than
it
had
been
before
the
cook
a
stout
and
slatternly
person
given
peter
thought
to
excessive
drinking
shared
with
a
small
and
noisy
maid
the
duties
of
the
house
they
were
most
inefficiently
performed
but
with
this
clearing
of
the
platform
the
hatred
between
peter
and
his
father
became
a
definite
and
terrible
thing
it
expressed
itself
silently
at
present
they
very
rarely
spoke
and
except
on
sundays
met
only
at
breakfast
and
in
the
evening
but
the
air
was
charged
with
the
violence
of
their
relationship
the
boy
growing
in
body
so
strangely
like
the
man
expressed
a
sullen
and
dogged
defiance
in
his
every
movement
the
man
watched
him
as
a
snake
might
watch
the
bird
held
by
its
power
they
stood
as
wrestlers
stand
before
the
moment
for
their
meeting
has
arrived
the
house
always
too
large
for
their
needs
seemed
now
to
stretch
into
an
infinity
of
echoing
passages
and
empty
rooms
the
many
windows
gathered
the
dust
thick
upon
their
sills
the
old
grandfather
stayed
in
his
chair
by
the
fire
only
at
night
he
was
wheeled
out
into
his
dreary
bedroom
by
the
cook
who
now
washed
and
tidied
him
with
a
vigour
that
called
forth
shrill
screams
and
oaths
from
her
victim
he
hated
this
woman
with
the
most
bitter
loathing
and
sometimes
frightened
her
with
the
violence
of
his
curses
christmas
came
and
went
and
there
followed
a
number
of
those
wonderful
crisp
and
shining
days
that
a
cornish
winter
gives
to
its
worshippers
treliss
sparkled
and
glittered
the
stones
of
the
held
the
heat
of
the
sun
as
though
it
had
been
midsummer
and
the
grey
tower
lifted
its
old
head
proudly
to
the
blue
sky
the
sea
was
so
warm
that
bathing
was
possible
and
in
the
heart
of
the
brown
fields
there
was
a
whisper
of
early
spring
but
all
of
this
touched
scaw
house
not
at
all
grey
and
hard
in
its
bundle
of
dark
trees
it
stood
apart
and
refused
the
sun
peter
in
spite
of
himself
rejoiced
in
this
brave
weather
as
the
days
slipped
past
curiously
aloof
and
reserved
though
he
was
making
no
friends
and
seeking
for
none
nevertheless
he
began
to
look
about
him
and
considered
the
future
all
this
had
in
it
the
element
of
suspense
of
preparation
during
these
weeks
one
day
slipped
into
another
no
incidents
marked
their
preparation
but
up
at
scaw
house
they
were
marching
to
no
mean
climax
every
hour
hurried
the
issue
and
peter
meanwhile
as
february
came
whistling
and
storming
upon
the
world
grew
with
every
chiming
of
the
town
clock
more
morose
more
sullen
more
silent
there
were
times
when
he
thought
of
ending
it
all
an
instant
and
he
would
be
free
of
all
his
troubles
but
after
all
that
was
the
weakling
way
he
had
not
altogether
forgotten
those
words
spoken
so
long
ago
by
old
moses
so
much
for
the
pause
suddenly
one
dark
february
afternoon
the
curtain
was
rung
up
outside
zachary
tan
shop
and
peter
was
whirled
into
the
centre
of
the
stage
peter
had
not
seen
zachary
tan
for
a
long
time
he
had
grown
into
a
morbid
way
of
avoiding
everybody
and
would
slink
up
side
streets
or
go
round
on
leaving
the
office
by
the
sea
road
when
he
did
meet
people
who
had
once
been
kind
to
him
he
said
as
little
as
possible
to
them
and
left
them
abruptly
but
on
this
afternoon
zachary
was
not
to
be
denied
he
was
standing
at
the
door
of
his
shop
and
shouted
to
peter
come
away
in
peter
i
have
see
you
this
long
time
there
an
old
acquaintance
of
yours
inside
and
a
cup
of
tea
for
the
wind
was
whistling
up
the
street
the
first
drops
of
a
rain
storm
starred
the
pavement
and
there
was
a
pleasant
glow
behind
but
there
was
something
stronger
yet
that
drove
peter
into
the
shop
he
knew
with
some
strange
knowledge
who
that
old
acquaintance
was
he
felt
no
surprise
when
he
saw
in
the
little
back
room
laughing
with
all
his
white
teeth
shining
in
a
row
the
stout
and
cheerful
figure
of
emilio
zanti
peter
was
a
very
different
person
now
from
that
little
boy
who
had
once
followed
stephen
broad
figure
into
that
little
green
room
and
stared
at
zanti
cheerful
countenance
but
it
all
seemed
a
very
little
time
ago
outside
in
the
shop
there
was
the
same
suit
of
armour
on
the
shelves
the
silver
candlesticks
the
old
coins
the
little
indian
images
the
pieces
of
tapestry
within
the
little
room
the
same
sense
of
mystery
the
same
intimate
seclusion
from
the
outer
world
on
the
other
occasion
of
seeing
him
zanti
had
been
dimmed
by
a
small
boy
wonder
now
peter
was
old
enough
to
see
him
very
clearly
indeed
zanti
seemed
fat
only
because
his
clothes
were
so
tight
he
was
bigly
made
and
his
legs
and
arms
were
round
bolster
fashion
huge
thighs
and
small
ankles
thick
arms
and
slender
wrists
his
clothes
were
so
tight
that
they
seemed
in
a
jolly
kind
of
way
to
protest
oh
come
now
must
you
really
put
us
on
to
anything
quite
so
big
we
shall
burst
in
a
minute
we
really
the
face
was
large
and
flat
and
shining
like
a
sun
with
a
small
nose
like
a
door
knocker
and
a
large
mouth
the
very
essence
of
surprise
the
cheeks
and
the
chin
were
soft
and
rounded
and
looked
as
though
they
might
be
very
fat
one
day
a
double
chin
just
peeped
round
the
corner
he
was
a
little
bald
on
the
top
of
his
head
and
round
this
bald
patch
his
black
hair
clustered
protectingly
he
gave
you
the
impression
that
every
part
of
his
body
was
anxious
that
every
other
part
of
his
body
should
have
a
good
time
his
suit
was
a
very
bright
blue
and
his
waistcoat
had
little
brass
buttons
that
met
a
friend
with
all
the
twinkling
geniality
of
good
wishes
and
numberless
little
hospitalities
he
had
in
his
blue
silk
tie
a
pearl
so
large
and
so
white
that
sophisticated
citizens
might
have
doubted
that
it
was
a
pearl
at
all
but
peter
swallowed
zanti
whole
pearl
and
suit
and
all
oh
it
is
ze
little
friend
my
friend
are
you
young
gentleman
it
is
a
real
delight
to
be
with
you
zanti
swung
peter
hand
up
and
down
as
he
would
a
pump
handle
and
laughed
as
though
it
were
all
the
best
joke
in
the
world
curiously
enough
peter
did
not
resent
this
rapturous
greeting
it
moved
him
strongly
it
was
such
a
long
time
now
since
any
one
had
shown
any
interest
in
him
or
expressed
any
pleasure
at
the
sight
of
him
that
he
was
foolishly
moved
by
zanti
warmth
he
blushed
and
stammered
something
but
his
eyes
were
shining
and
his
lip
trembling
zanti
fixed
his
gaze
on
the
boy
oh
but
you
have
grown
yes
indeed
you
were
a
little
slip
before
but
now
not
so
no
not
but
broad
strong
oh
ze
arms
and
legs
there
a
back
zachary
interrupted
his
enthusiasm
with
some
general
remark
and
they
had
a
pleasant
little
every
now
and
again
the
shop
bell
tinkled
and
zachary
went
out
to
attend
to
it
and
then
zanti
drew
near
to
peter
as
though
he
were
going
to
confide
in
him
but
he
never
said
anything
only
laughed
once
he
mentioned
stephen
you
know
where
he
is
peter
broke
in
with
an
eager
whisper
ah
ha
that
would
be
telling
and
zanti
winked
his
eye
peter
heart
warmed
under
the
friendliness
of
it
all
there
was
very
much
of
the
boy
still
in
him
and
he
began
to
look
back
upon
the
days
that
he
had
spent
with
no
other
company
than
his
own
thoughts
as
cold
and
friendless
zachary
tan
had
been
always
ready
to
receive
him
warmly
why
had
he
passed
him
so
churlishly
by
and
refused
his
outstretched
hand
but
there
was
more
in
it
than
that
zanti
attracted
him
most
compellingly
the
genial
man
spoke
to
him
of
all
the
glitter
and
adventure
of
the
outside
world
back
crowding
upon
him
came
all
those
adventurous
thoughts
and
desires
that
he
had
known
before
in
zanti
company
but
tinged
now
by
that
grey
threatening
background
of
scaw
house
and
its
melancholy
inhabitants
what
would
he
not
give
to
escape
perhaps
mr
zanti
the
little
green
room
began
to
extend
its
narrow
walls
and
to
include
in
its
boundaries
flashing
rivers
shining
cities
wide
and
bounteous
plains
beyond
the
shop
dark
now
with
its
treasures
mysteriously
gleaming
the
steep
little
street
held
up
its
lamps
to
be
transformed
into
yellow
flame
and
at
its
foot
by
the
wooden
jetty
as
the
night
fell
the
sea
crept
ever
more
secretly
with
its
white
fingers
gleaming
below
the
shingles
of
the
beach
here
was
wonder
and
glory
enough
with
the
wind
tearing
and
beating
outside
the
windows
blowing
the
young
flowers
of
the
lamps
up
and
down
inside
their
glass
houses
and
screaming
down
the
chimneys
for
sheer
zest
of
life
but
here
it
all
had
its
centre
in
this
little
room
with
emilio
zanti
chuckling
for
no
reason
at
all
and
spreading
his
broad
fat
hand
over
peter
westcott
knee
well
peter
and
you
been
to
london
in
all
these
years
or
perhaps
you
forgotten
that
you
ever
wanted
to
go
there
no
peter
was
still
of
the
same
mind
but
treliss
and
a
few
miles
up
and
down
the
road
were
as
much
of
the
world
as
he
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
except
for
school
in
devonshire
and
you
still
go
my
leetle
friend
yes
i
want
to
go
i
hate
being
in
an
office
and
what
is
it
zat
you
will
do
when
you
are
there
suddenly
in
a
flash
illuminating
the
little
room
shining
over
the
whole
world
peter
knew
what
it
was
that
he
would
do
i
will
write
what
with
that
word
muttered
his
head
hanging
his
cheeks
flushing
as
though
it
were
something
of
which
he
was
most
mightily
ashamed
he
knew
what
it
was
he
had
been
wanting
all
these
months
the
desire
had
been
there
the
impulse
had
been
there
now
with
the
spoken
word
the
blind
faltering
impulse
was
changed
into
definite
certainty
zanti
thought
it
a
tremendous
joke
he
roared
shouted
with
riotous
laughter
oh
ze
boy
he
will
be
the
death
of
me
will
write
stories
oh
yes
so
easy
so
very
simple
will
write
stories
oh
but
peter
was
very
solemn
he
did
not
like
his
great
intention
to
be
laughed
at
i
mean
it
he
said
rather
gruffly
oh
yes
that
of
course
but
that
is
enough
oh
dear
yes
well
my
friend
i
like
you
you
are
very
strong
you
are
brave
i
can
see
you
have
a
fine
spirit
one
thing
you
lack
with
all
you
english
it
is
the
he
paused
interrogatively
but
peter
did
not
seem
to
wish
to
know
what
this
quality
was
yes
it
is
ze
humour
you
do
not
see
how
funny

solemn
and

will
be
annoyed

it
tiresome
because
i
laugh

said
peter
gravely
i
like
your
ah
that
is
suddenly
he
jerked
his
body
forward
and
stared
into
peter
face
well
will
you
come
peter
hung
back
his
face
white
he
was
only
conscious
that
zachary
quiet
and
smiling
in
the
background
watched
him
intently
what
with

to
london
yes

oh

his
heart
was
beating
so
that

oh
he
murmured
oh

zanti
clapped

on
the
shoulder

pleasant

and

ho
yes
to
peter
then
the
shop
was
not
visible
a
mist
hung
about
his
eyes
much
time
for
your
stories
said
zanti
and
he
shouted
with
laughter
as
his
big
form
hung
before
peter
the
large
white
hand
with
the
flashing
rings
enclosed
peter
for
a
moment
the
hands
were
on
his
shoulders
and
in
his
nostrils
was
the
pungent
scent
of
the
that
zanti
affected
afterwards
silence
peter
said
farewell
to
zachary
and
promised
to
come
soon
and
see
him
again
the
little
bell
tinkled
behind
him
and
he
was
in
the
street
the
great
wind
caught
him
and
blew
him
along
the
cobbles
the
flying
mountains
of
cloud
swept
like
galleons
across
the
moor
and
in
heart
was
overwhelming
triumph
the
lights
of
london
lit
the
black
darkness
of
the
high
sea
road
iv
the
doors
of
scaw
house
clanged
behind
him
and
at
once
he
was
aware
that
his
father
had
to
be
faced
supper
was
eaten
in
silence
peter
watched
his
father
and
his
grandfather
here
were
the
three
of
them
alone
what
his
grandfather
was
his
father
would
one
day
be
what
his
father
was
he
yes
he
must
escape
he
stared
at
the
room
dreary
furniture
he
listened
to
the
driving
rain
and
he
was
conscious
that
from
the
other
side
of
the
table
his
father
eyes
were
upon
him
father
he
said
i
want
to
go
his
heart
was
thumping
westcott
got
up
from
his
place
at
the
table
and
stood
with
his
legs
a
little
apart
looking
down
at
his
son
why
i
doing
no
good
here
that
office
is
no
use
to
me
i
shall
never
be
a
solicitor
i
nearly
eighteen
and
i
shall
never
get
on
here
i
remember
things
my
mother
his
voice
choked
his
father
smiled
and
where
do
you
want
to
go
to
oh
and
what
will

do
there
i
have
a
friend

a
bookshop

pounds
a
week
at
first
so
that
i
should
be
quite
independent

no

rose
suddenly
from

table
they
faced
one
another
i
want
you
to
let
me

you
have
never
cared
in
the
least
for

any
rate
and
when

the
wednesday
after

he
said

me
a
chance

can
do
things

london

feel
it
here
i
shall
never

peter
raised
his
eyes
to
his
father
and
then
dropped
them
westcott
senior
was
not
pleasant
to
look
at
let
us
have
no
more
of
this
you
will
stay
here
because
i
wish

i
like
to
have

and
he
placed
his
hand
on
the
boy
shoulder
never
mention

again
for
your
own
sake
you
will
stay
here
until
i
wish

peter

shouted
i

my
freedom

you
ever
done
for
me
that
i
should
obey
you
i
want
to
leave
you
and
never
see
you
again
i
and
then
his
eyes
fell
his
legs
were
shaking
his
father
was
watching
him
no
movement
in
his
short
thick
body
peter
voice
faltered
i
go
he
said
sullenly
his
eyes
on
the
ground
his
grandfather
stirred
in
his
sleep
oh
what
a
noise
he
muttered
with
the
rain
and
but
westcott
removed
with
a
careful
hand
the
melodrama
that
his
young
son
had
flung
about
the
room
that
enough
noise
he
said
you
will
go
to
london
nor
indeed
anywhere
else
and
for
your
own
peace
of
mind
i
should
advise
you
not
to
mention
the
subject
again
the
hour
is
a
little
early
but
i
recommend
your
peter
went
he
was
trembling
from
head
to
foot
why
he
undressed
and
prepared
himself
for
battle
battle
it
was
to
be
for
the
wednesday
in
easter
week
would
find
him
in
the
london
train
of
that
there
was
to
be
no
question
meanwhile
with
the
candle
blown
out
and
no
moon
across
the
floor
it
was
quite
certain
that
courage
would
be
necessary
he
was
fighting
more
than
his
father
v
he
woke
suddenly
a
little
wind
blowing
through
the
open
door
flickered
the
light
of
a
candle
that
flung
a
dim
circle
about
the
floor
within
the
circle
was
his
father
black
clothes
and
white
face
he
was
looking
with
the
candle
held
high
across
the
room
to
the
bed
he
drew
back
the
candle
and
closed
the
door
softly
behind
him
his
feet
made
no
sound
as
they
passed
away
down
the
passage
peter
lay
quaking
wide
eyed
in
his
bed
until
full
morning
and
time
for
getting
up
the
opening
certainly
of
a
campaign
chapter
x
sunlight
limelight
daylight
i
easter
fell
early
that
year
the
last
days
of
march
held
its
festival
and
the
winds
and
rains
of
that
blustering
month
attended
the
birth
of
its
primroses
young
peter
spent
his
days
in
preparation
for
the
swift
coming
of
easter
wednesday
and
in
varying
moods
of
exultation
terror
industry
and
idleness
he
did
not
see
zanti
during
this
period
that
gentleman
was
he
was
informed
away
on
business
and
it
was
characteristic
of
him
that
he
asked
zachary
tan
no
questions
whether
of
the
mysterious
bookshop
of
london
generally
or
of
any
possible
news
about
stephen
the
latter
a
secret
that
he
was
convinced
the
dark
little
curiosity
shop
somewhere
contained
but
he
had
an
amazing
number
of
things
to
think
about
and
the
solicitor
office
was
the
barest
background
for
his
chasing
thoughts
he
spoke
to
no
one
of
his
approaching
freedom
but
the
thought
of
it
hung
in
rich
and
burning
colour
ever
at
the
back
of
his
thoughts
meanwhile
the
changing
developments
at
scaw
house
were
of
a
nature
to
frighten
any
boy
who
was
compelled
to
share
in
them
it
could
not
be
denied
that
westcott
had
altered
very
strangely
since
his
death
the
grim
place
with
its
deserted
garden
had
never
seen
many
callers
nor
friendly
faces
but
the
man
with
the
milk
the
boy
with
the
butcher
meat
the
old
postman
with
the
letters
stayed
now
as
brief
a
time
over
their
business
as
might
be
and
hurried
down
the
paths
with
eager
haste
since
the
departure
of
the
invaluable
trussit
a
new
order
reigned
pascoe
her
dress
unfastened
her
hair
astray
her
shoes
at
heel
her
speech
thick
and
uncertain
was
queen
of
the
kitchen
and
indeed
of
other
things
had
they
but
known
all
but
to
peter
there
was
more
in
this
than
the
arrival
of
pascoe
with
every
day
his
father
was
changing
changing
so
swiftly
that
when
peter
mother
had
been
buried
only
a
month
that
earlier
westcott
cold
stern
reserved
terrible
seemed
incredible
he
was
terrible
now
but
with
how
different
a
terror
to
peter
this
new
figure
was
a
thing
of
the
utmost
horror
he
had
known
how
to
brace
himself
for
that
other
authority
there
had
at
any
rate
been
consistency
and
even
a
kind
of
chiselled
magnificence
in
that
stiff
brutality
now
there
was
degradation
crawling
devilry
things
unmentionable
this
new
terror
broke
upon
him
at
supper
two
nights
after
he
had
first
spoken
about
london
the
meal
had
not
been
passed
as
usual
in
silence
his
father
had
talked
strangely
to
himself
his
voice
was
thick
and
uncertain
his
hand
shook
as
he
cut
the
bread
pascoe
had
come
in
the
middle
of
the
meal
to
give
food
to
the
old
grandfather
who
displayed
his
usual
trembling
greed
she
stood
with
arms
akimbo
watching
them
as
they
sat
at
table
and
smiling
her
coarse
face
flushed
pudding
said
westcott
ye
be
the
pudding
when
it
ready
says
she
damn
from
westcott
but
he
sits
still
looking
at
the
and
his
hand
shaking
to
peter
this
new
thing
was
beyond
all
possibility
horrible
this
new
shaking
creature
i
did
kill
her
you
know
peter
westcott
says
quite
smoothly
when
the
cloth
had
been
cleared
and
they
are
alone
and
then
suddenly
stay
where
you
are
i
have
stories
to
tell
peter
white
to
the
lips
was
held
in
his
place
he
could
not
move
or
speak
then
during
the
following
two
hours
his
father
without
moving
from
his
place
poured
forth
a
stream
of
stories
foul
filthy
horrible
beyond
all
telling
he
related
them
with
no
joy
or
humour
or
bestial
gloating
over
their
obscenities
only
with
a
staring
eye
and
his
fingers
twisting
and
untwisting
on
the
at
last
peter
his
head
hanging
his
cheeks
flaming
crept
to
his
attic
at
breakfast
his
father
was
again
that
other
man
stern
immovable
a
was
that
trembling
shadow
of
the
night
before
and
pascoe
once
more
in
her
way
submissive
in
her
place
the
most
abiding
impression
with
peter
thinking
of
it
afterwards
in
the
dark
lanes
that
run
towards
the
sea
when
the
evening
was
creeping
along
the
hill
was
of
a
fiery
eye
gleaming
from
old
grandfather
pile
of
rugs
was
it
imagined
or
was
there
indeed
a
triumph
there
a
triumph
that
no
age
nor
weakness
could
obscure
and
from
the
induction
of
that
first
terrible
evening
peter
stepped
into
a
blind
terror
that
gave
the
promised
deliverance
of
that
approaching
easter
wednesday
an
air
of
blind
necessity
also
about
the
house
the
dust
and
neglect
crept
and
increased
as
though
it
had
been
in
its
menace
and
evil
omen
a
veritable
beast
of
prey
doors
were
off
their
hinges
windows
screamed
to
their
clanging
shutters
the
grime
lay
like
sand
about
the
sills
and
corners
of
the
rooms
at
night
the
house
was
astir
with
sound
but
with
no
human
voices
ii
but
it
was
only
at
night
that
terror
crept
from
its
cupboard
and
leapt
on
to
peter
shoulders
he
defied
it
even
then
with
set
lips
and
the
beginning
of
a
conception
of
the
duties
that
courage
demands
of
its
worshippers
he
would
fight
it
let
it
develop
as
it
would
but
during
these
weeks
in
the
sunlight
he
thought
nothing
of
it
at
all
but
only
with
eager
eyes
watched
his
father
his
reading
had
in
these
latter
years
been
slender
enough
it
was
seldom
that
he
had
any
money
there
was
no
circulating
library
in
treliss
at
that
time
and
he
knew
no
one
who
could
lend
him
books
he
fell
back
perforce
on
the
few
that
he
had
and
especially
on
the
three
henry
but
he
had
in
his
head
and
he
had
known
it
without
putting
it
into
words
for
a
very
long
time
the
thousand
and
one
nights
of
peter
westcott
stories
that
would
go
on
night
after
night
before
he
went
to
sleep
stories
that
were
concerned
with
enormous
families
whose
genealogies
had
to
be
worked
out
on
paper
here
was
incipient
realism
or
again
stories
concerning
treasure
and
masses
of
it
banks
of
diamonds
mountains
of
pearls
columns
of
rubies
white
marble
temples
processions
of
white
elephants
cloth
of
gold
here
was
incipient
romance
never
be
it
noticed
at
this
time
incipient
humour
life
had
been
too
heavy
a
thing
for
that
but
these
stories
formerly
racing
through
his
brain
because
they
must
because
indeed
they
were
there
against
his
own
will
or
any
one
else
had
now
a
most
definite
place
and
purpose
in
their
existence
they
were
there
now
because
they
were
to
be
trained
to
be
educated
to
be
developed
until
they
were
fit
to
appear
in
public
he
had
even
in
these
early
days
no
false
idea
of
the
agonies
and
tortures
of
this
gift
of
his
was
it
not
in
henry
lessingham
and
so
with
this
task
before
him
he
knew
that
words
were
of
many
orders
and
regiments
and
armies
and
those
that
were
hard
of
purchase
and
difficult
of
discipline
were
the
possessions
of
value
for
nothing
that
is
light
and
easy
in
its
production
is
of
any
duration
or
lasting
and
so
during
these
weeks
when
he
should
have
attended
to
the
duties
of
a
solicitor
his
mind
was
hunting
far
away
in
those
forests
where
very
many
had
hunted
before
him
and
behold
he
was
out
for
fame
spring
was
blown
across
the
country
by
the
wildest
storms
that
the
had
known
for
very
many
years
for
days
the
seas
rose
against
the
rocks
in
a
cursing
fury
the
battle
of
rock
and
wave
gave
pretty
spectacle
to
the
surrounding
country
and
suddenly
the
warriors
having
proved
the
mettle
of
their
hardihood
turned
once
again
to
good
fellowship
but
the
wind
and
the
rain
had
done
their
work
in
the
week
before
easter
with
the
first
broadening
sweep
of
the
sun
across
the
rich
brown
earth
and
down
into
the
depths
of
the
twisting
lanes
the
spring
was
there
there
in
the
sweet
smell
of
the
roots
as
they
stirred
towards
the
light
there
in
the
watery
gleam
of
the
grass
as
it
caught
diamonds
from
the
sun
but
there
above
all
in
the
primrose
clump
hidden
in
the
clefts
of
the
little
cornish
woods
so
with
a
cry
of
delight
spring
had
leapt
from
the
shoulders
of
that
roaring
wind
and
danced
across
the
cornish
hills
on
good
friday
there
was
an
incident
peter
was
free
of
the
office
for
the
day
and
had
walked
towards
truro
there
was
a
little
hill
that
stood
above
the
town
it
was
marked
by
a
tree
clump
black
against
the
blue
sky
at
its
side
was
a
chalk
pit
naked
white
beyond
was
truro
huddled
with
the
fal
a
silver
ribbon
in
the
sun
peter
stood
and
watched
and
sat
down
because
he
liked
the
view
he
had
walked
a
very
long
way
and
was
tired
and
it
was
an
afternoon
as
hot
as
summer
suddenly
there
was
a
cry
help
please
oh
help
to
get
he
looked
up
and
saw
standing
in
front
of
him
a
little
girl
in
a
black
hat
and
a
short
black
frock
she
had
red
hair
that
the
sun
was
transforming
into
gold
her
face
was
white
with
terror
and
tears
were
making
muddy
marks
on
it
and
her
hands
were
black
with
dirt
she
was
a
very
little
girl
she
appealed
to
him
between
her
sobs
and
he
understood
that
crumpet
was
a
dog
that
it
had
fallen
some
way
down
the
and
that
miss
jackson
was
reading
her
bible
under
a
he
jumped
up
immediately
and
went
to
find
crumpet
a
little
way
down
the
a
puppy
was
balancing
its
fat
body
on
a
ledge
of
chalk
and
looking
piteously
up
and
down
peter
clambered
down
caught
the
little
struggling
animal
in
his
arms
and
restored
it
to
its
mistress
and
now
followed
an
immense
deal
of
kissing
and
embracing
the
dog
was
buried
in
red
hair
and
only
once
and
again
a
wriggling
paw
might
be
observed
also
these
exclamations
oh
the
was
it
nearly
falling
down
the
great
horrid
pit
the
darling
oh
the
little
darling
and
was
it
scratched
the
pet
but
it
was
a
wicked
little
dog
yes
it
was
to
go
down
that
nasty
place
when
it
was
told
not
to
more
murmurings
and
then
the
back
was
straightened
the
red
gold
hair
flung
back
and
a
flushed
face
turned
to
the
rather
awkward
peter
who
stood
at
attention
thank
you
thanks
most
awfully
oh
you
darling
this
to
the
puppy
you
see
miss
jackson
was
reading
her
bible
aloud
to
herself
and
i
ca
stand
that
neither
can
crumpet
and
she
always
forgets
all
about
us
and
so
we
go
away
by
ourselves
and
reading
the
bible
makes
her
sleep
she
asleep
now
and
then
crumpet
would
stay
at
heel
although
i
was
telling
him
ever
so
hard
and
he
would
go
over
the
cliff
and
if
you
had
been
there
at
the
thought
of
the
awful
disaster
the
puppy
was
again
embraced
apparently
crumpet
was
no
sentimentalist
and
had
had
enough
of
feminine
emotion
he
wriggled
out
of
his
mistress
arms
flopped
to
the
ground
shook
himself
and
advancing
to
peter
smelt
his
boots
he
likes
you
i
so
glad
he
only
does
that
to
people
he
likes
and
he
very
the
small
girl
flung
her
hair
back
smiled
at
peter
and
sat
down
on
the
grass
it
may
be
rather
damp
peter
said
feeling
very
old
and
cautious
and
thinking
that
she
really
was
the
oddest
child
he
even
seen
in
his
life
it
only
march
you
it
nothing
to
do
with
months
it
whether
it
rained
or
not
and
it
has
sit
down
with
me
old
jackson
wo
be
here
for
peter
sat
down
the
puppy
was
a
charming
specimen
of
its
kind
it
had
enormous
ears
huge
flat
feet
and
a
round
fat
body
like
a
very
small
barrel
it
was
very
fond
of
peter
and
licked
his
cheek
and
his
hands
and
finally
dragged
off
his
cap
imagined
it
a
rabbit
and
bit
it
with
a
great
deal
of
savagery
and
there
followed
conversation
i
like
you
most
awfully
i
like
your
neck
and
your
eyes
and
your
hair
it
stiff
like
my
father
my
name
is
clare
elizabeth
rossiter
what
yours
peter
do
you
live
here
no
a
good
long
way
away
by
the
oh
i
staying
at
kenwyn
my
uncle
lives
at
kenwyn
but
i
live
in
london
with
father
and
mother
and
aunt
grace
it
nice
here
i
think
you
such
a
nice
boy
will
you
come
and
see
father
and
mother
in
london
peter
smiled
it
would
not
be
the
thing
for
some
one
in
a
bookshop
to
go
and
call
on
the
parents
of
any
one
who
could
afford
crumpet
and
miss
jackson
but
the
thought
of
london
the
very
name
of
it
sent
his
blood
tingling
to
his
face
perhaps
we
shall
meet
he
said
i
going
to
london
oh
are
you
oh
how
nice
then
of
course
you
will
come
to
tea
every
one
comes
to
crumpet
tired
of
the
rabbit
worn
out
with
adventure
and
peril
struggled
into
peter
lap
and
slumbered
with
one
ear
lying
back
across
his
eyes
the
sun
slipped
down
upon
the
town
and
touched
the
black
cathedral
with
flame
and
turned
the
silver
of
the
river
into
burning
gold
on
the
bend
of
the
hill
against
the
sky
came
a
black
gaunt
figure
miss
jackson
clare
elizabeth
rossiter
leapt
to
her
feet
clutched
crumpet
held
him
upside
down
and
turned
to
go
but
for
an
instant
she
stayed
and
peter
was
rewarded
with
a
very
wonderful
smile
i
am
so
glad
you
were
here
she
generally
sleeps
longer
but
perhaps
it
was
new
testament
and
that
more
exciting
it
is
a
pity
because
there
were
such
lots
of
things
i
like
you
most
she
gave
him
a
very
dirty
hand
and
then
her
black
stockings
vanished
over
the
hill
peter
turned
through
a
flaming
sunset
towards
his
home
the
end
of
the
incident
iii
but
he
came
home
on
that
good
friday
evening
with
an
idea
that
that
afternoon
on
the
hill
had
given
him
it
was
an
idea
that
came
to
him
from
the
little
piece
of
superstition
that
he
carried
about
with
him
every
cornishman
carries
it
treliss
was
always
a
place
of
many
customs
and
although
now
these
ceremonies
drag
themselves
along
with
all
the
mercenary
that
america
and
cheap
trips
from
manchester
have
given
to
the
place
at
this
stage
of
peter
history
they
were
genuine
and
honest
enough
to
see
from
the
top
of
the
grey
hill
the
rising
of
the
sun
on
easter
morning
was
one
of
them
a
charm
that
brought
the
most
infallible
good
luck
until
next
easter
day
came
round
again
and
good
for
you
if
you
could
watch
that
sunrise
with
the
lad
or
lass
of
your
choice
for
to
pass
round
the
giant
finger
as
the
beams
caught
the
stone
made
the
success
of
your
union
beyond
all
question
there
was
risk
about
it
for
if
mists
veiled
the
light
or
if
clouds
dimmed
the
rising
then
were
your
prospects
but
gloomy
but
a
fine
easter
morning
had
decided
many
a
wedding
in
treliss
peter
had
known
of
this
for
many
years
but
in
earlier
times
he
had
not
been
at
liberty
and
of
late
there
had
been
other
things
to
think
about
but
here
was
a
fine
chance
was
he
not
flinging
himself
into
the
world
under
the
very
hazardous
patronage
of
zanti
on
easter
wednesday
and
would
he
not
therefore
need
every
blessing
that
he
could
get
and
who
knew
after
all
whether
these
things
were
such
nonsense
they
were
old
enough
these
customs
and
many
wise
people
believed
in
them
moreover
one
had
not
been
brought
up
in
the
company
of
frosted
moses
and
dicky
the
fool
without
catching
some
of
their
fever
there
was
a
little
star
rolling
down
hill
like
a
button
says
dicky
with
his
eyes
staring
well
and
why
not
and
indeed
here
was
peter
at
this
stage
of
things
a
mad
i
bundle
of
contradictions
old
as
a
judge
when
up
against
the
realities
young
as
crumpet
the
puppy
when
staring
at
romance
give
him
bread
and
you
have
him
of
stern
cold
hard
of
muscle
grim
frown
stiff
back
no
smiles
give
him
jam
and
you
have
credulity
simplicity
longing
for
friendship
tenderness
devotion
to
a
small
girl
in
a
black
frock
a
heart
big
as
the
world
see
him
on
good
friday
afternoon
laughing
eagerly
questioning
a
boy
see
him
on
good
friday
night
grim
legs
stiff
eyes
cold
as
stones
a
man
no
easy
thing
for
blowzy
thunderings
to
conquer
but
something
vastly
amusing
apparently
to
grandfather
westcott
to
watch
he
discovered
that
the
sun
rose
about
six
and
therefore
five
on
easter
morning
found
him
shivering
in
the
desolate
garden
with
his
nose
pressed
to
the
little
wooden
gate
the
high
road
crossed
the
moor
at
no
great
distance
from
him
but
the
faint
grey
light
that
hung
like
gauze
about
him
was
not
yet
strong
enough
to
reveal
it
he
would
hear
them
as
they
passed
and
they
must
all
go
up
that
road
on
the
way
to
the
hill
in
the
garden
there
was
darkness
and
beyond
it
in
the
high
shadow
of
the
house
and
the
surrounding
trees
blackness
he
could
smell
the
soil
and
his
cheeks
were
wet
with
beads
of
moisture
very
faintly
the
recurrent
boom
of
the
sea
came
through
the
mist
dimmed
as
though
by
thick
folds
of
hanging
carpet
suddenly
the
dark
trees
by
the
house
moved
by
a
secret
wind
would
shudder
the
little
black
gate
slowly
revealed
its
bars
against
the
sky
as
the
grey
shadows
lightened
then
there
were
voices
coming
through
the
dark
shut
off
like
the
sea
by
the
mist
strange
voices
not
human
but
sharing
with
the
soil
and
the
trees
the
mysterious
quality
of
the
night
the
voices
passed
up
the
road
silence
and
then
more
voices
peter
unlatched
the
gate
and
stole
out
to
the
road
stumbling
over
the
rough
moorland
path
and
clambering
across
the
ditch
to
safer
ground
figures
were
moving
like
shadows
and
voices
fell
echoing
and
like
notes
of
music
this
was
dissociated
from
all
human
feeling
and
the
mists
curled
up
like
smoke
and
faded
into
the
air
peter
in
silence
followed
these
shadows
and
knew
that
there
were
other
shadows
behind
him
it
would
not
take
long
to
climb
the
grey
hill
they
would
be
at
the
top
by
five
there
was
a
voice
in
his
ear
hallo
you
westcott
why
who
would
have
thought
it
he
turned
round
and
found
at
his
side
the
peaked
face
of
willie
daffoll
now
a
young
man
of
eighteen
with
an
affection
for
bright
ties
and
socks
once
the
small
child
who
had
fought
with
peter
at
old
years
ago
peter
had
not
seen
very
much
of
him
during
those
years
they
had
met
in
the
streets
of
treliss
had
spoken
a
word
or
two
but
no
friendship
or
intimacy
but
this
early
hour
this
mysterious
dawn
bred
confidence
and
peter
having
grown
under
the
approaching
glitter
of
london
more
human
during
the
last
few
weeks
than
he
had
been
in
all
his
life
before
was
glad
to
talk
to
him
oh
i
often
wanted
to
go
he
said
it
brings
good
luck
you
well
fancy
your
believing
that
i
never
thought
you
believe
in
rot
like
why
are
you
going
then
the
young
man
of
ties
and
waistcoats
dropped
his
voice
oh
a
girl
she
here
somewhere
she
said
she
come
thinks
there
something
in
it
anyhow
she
wants
it
she
stunning
a
girl
peter
mind
flew
absurdly
back
to
a
small
child
in
a
short
black
frock
oh
crumpet
a
girl
young
daffoll
had
spoken
as
though
it
were
indeed
something
to
get
up
at
four
in
the
morning
for
peter
wanted
to
hear
more
young
daffoll
was
quite
ready
to
tell
him
no
names
of
course
but
they
were
going
to
be
married
one
day
his
governor
would
be
furious
of
course
and
they
might
have
to
run
away
but
she
was
game
for
anything
no
he
only
known
her
a
fortnight
but
it
had
been
a
matter
of
love
at
first
sight
extraordinary
thing
thought
he
been
head
over
ears
before
but
never
anything
like
this
yes
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
was
in
a
in
the
high
street
her
people
had
come
down
in
the
world
and
so
the
golden
picture
unfolded
as
the
gauze
curtains
were
drawn
back
from
the
world
and
the
shoulder
of
the
grey
hill
rose
like
a
cloud
before
them
peter
heart
beat
faster
as
he
listened
to
this
story
here
was
one
of
his
dreams
translated
into
actual
fact
would
he
one
day
also
have
some
one
for
whom
he
would
be
ready
to
run
to
the
end
of
the
world
if
furious
parents
demanded
it
she
would
have
he
was
sure
hair
and
a
wonderful
smile
they
climbed
the
grey
hill
there
was
with
them
now
quite
a
company
of
persons
still
for
the
mists
were
thick
about
the
road
but
soon
all
the
butchers
and
bakers
of
the
world
and
let
it
be
remembered
all
the
lovers
would
be
revealed
now
as
they
climbed
the
hill
silence
fell
even
young
daffoll
was
quiet
that
too
it
seemed
was
part
of
the
ceremony
the
hill
top
was
swiftly
gained
the
giant
finger
black
and
straight
like
a
needle
stood
through
the
shadows
beyond
there
would
be
the
sea
and
that
was
where
the
sun
would
rise
at
present
darkness
they
all
sat
down
on
the
stones
that
covered
the
summit
on
either
side
of
peter
there
were
figures
but
daffoll
had
vanished
it
seemed
that
he
had
discovered
his
lady
peter
sitting
meditating
on
the
story
that
he
had
heard
and
feeling
suddenly
lonely
and
deserted
was
conscious
of
a
small
shoe
that
touched
his
boot
it
was
beyond
argument
a
friendly
shoe
he
could
feel
that
in
the
inviting
tap
that
it
gave
to
him
he
was
aware
also
that
his
shoulder
was
touching
another
shoulder
and
that
that
shoulder
was
soft
and
warm
finally
his
hand
touched
another
hand
fingers
were
intertwined
there
was
much
conversation
out
of
the
mist
law
chrisy
well
it
the
last
easter
morning
for
me
thiccy
sun
hides
himself
right
enough
it
poor
trade
sitting
shivering
your
not
that
i
care
for
the
woman

tregothan
sir
with
her
haverings
talking
all
i
saying
is
that
if
she
to
come
wastin
my
time
thiccy
man
sitting
there
stormin
like
an
old
owl
in
a
oh
get
along
with
ye
no
i
wo
be
sitting
by
ye
there
now
the
sea
like
a
young
web
stretched
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
stole
out
of
the
darkness
on
the
horizon
a
thin
line
of
dull
yellow
it
be
a
fine
sunrise
the
figures
on
the
hill
were
gathering
shape
and
form
and
many
of
them
now
were
standing
their
bodies
sharp
against
the
grey
sky
peter
had
not
turned
his
eyes
were
staring
out
to
sea
but
his
body
was
pressed
closely
against
the
girl
at
his
side
he
did
not
turn
nor
look
at
her
she
was
staring
at
him
with
wonder
in
her
eyes
and
a
smile
on
her
lips
she
was
a
very
common
girl
with
black
hair
and
cheeks
and
she
was
one
of
the
dairymaids
from
tregothan
farm
she
did
not
know
whom
this
strange
young
man
might
be
and
it
was
not
yet
light
enough
to
see
she
did
not
care
such
things
had
happened
often
enough
before
and
she
leant
her
fat
body
against
his
shoulder
she
could
feel
his
heart
thumping
and
his
hands
were
very
hot
but
she
thought
that
it
was
strange
that
he
did
not
turn
and
look
at
her
there
was
a
stir
and
murmur
among
the
crowd
on
the
hill
for
behold
it
would
be
a
fine
sunrise
the
dull
yellow
had
brightened
to
gold
and
was
speeding
like
a
herald
across
the
grey
black
on
the
hill
gold
on
the
sky
a
trembling
whispering
blue
across
the
sea
in
a
moment
there
would
be
the
sun
what
gods
were
there
hiding
at
that
instant
on
the
hill
watching
with
scornful
eyes
this
crowd
of
moderns
hidden
there
behind
the
stones
what
mysteries
screening
with
their
delicate
bodies
the
faint
colours
of
the
true
dawn
playing
on
their
pipes
tunes
that
these
citizens
with
their
coarse
voices
and
dull
hearing
could
not
understand
what
ancient
watchers
of
the
hill
pass
and
repass
behold
the
butchers
and
bakers
behold
winneren
hosier
and
outfitter
young
robert
trefusis
farmer
miss
bessie
waddell
from
the
these
others
fade
away
as
the
sun
rises
the
grey
mists
pass
with
them
the
sun
is
about
to
leap
above
the
rim
of
the
sea
peter
turns
and
crushes
the
poor
dairymaid
in
his
arms
and
stifles
the
little
scream
with
the
first
kiss
of
his
life
his
whole
body
burns
in
that
kiss
and
then
as
the
sun
streams
across
the
sea
he
has
sprung
to
his
feet
and
vanishes
over
the
brow
of
the
hill
the
dairymaid
wipes
her
lips
with
the
back
of
her
hand
they
have
joined
hands
and
are
already
dancing
round
the
giant
finger
it
is
black
now
but
in
a
moment
the
flames
of
the
sun
will
leap
upon
it
and
good
omens
will
send
them
all
singing
down
the
hill
iv
on
tuesday
evening
peter
slipped
for
a
moment
into
zachary
tan
shop
and
told
zanti
that
he
would
be
on
the
station
platform
at
seven
on
the
following
morning
he
could
scarcely
speak
for
excitement
he
was
also
filled
with
a
penetrating
sadness
above
all
he
wished
only
to
exchange
the
briefest
word
with
his
future
master
he
did
not
understand
altogether
but
it
was
perhaps
because
zanti
and
all
his
world
belonged
to
zanti
fat
jolly
body
his
laugh
his
huge
soft
hands
peter
could
not
do
more
to
this
gentleman
than
remember
that
he
meant
so
much
that
he
would
be
overwhelmed
by
him
if
he
did
not
leave
him
alone
so
he
darted
in
and
gave
his
message
and
darted
out
again
the
little
street
was
shining
in
the
sun
and
the
gentlest
waves
were
lapping
the
wooden
jetty
oh
this
dear
town
these
houses
these
cobbles
all
the
smells
and
colours
of
the
place
he
was
leaving
it
all
so
easily
on
so
perilous
an
adventure
poor
peter
was
moved
by
so
many
things
that
he
could
only
gulp
the
tears
back
and
hurry
home
there
was
at
any
rate
work
to
be
done
there
about
which
there
could
be
no
uncertain
intention
his
father
had
been
drinking
all
the
afternoon
pascoe
with
red
arms
akimbo
watched
them
as
they
ate
their
supper
when
the
meal
was
finished
peter
standing
by
his
father
his
face
very
white
said
i
am
going
to
london
westcott
had
aged
a
great
deal
during
the
last
month
his
hair
was
touched
with
grey
there
were
dark
lines
under
his
eyes
his
cheeks
were
sunken
his
lip
trembled
he
was
looking
moodily
at
the
cloth
crumbling
his
bread
he
did
not
hear
peter
remark
but
continued
his
argument
with
pascoe
it
was
cooked
i
tell
you
you
growing
as
slack
as
your
precious
son
got
something
as
would
like
to
say
to
yer
remarked
that
pleasant
woman
grimly
peter
repeated
his
remark
his
father
grasped
it
but
slowly
at
last
he
said
damn
you
what
are
you
talking
about
i
leaving
here
and
going
to
london
westcott
turned
his
bloodshot
eyes
in
the
direction
of
the
curse
it
i
ca
see
straight
you
young
devil
i
do
for
you
all
this
said
rather
sullenly
and
as
though
he
were
speaking
to
himself
peter
having
delivered
his
news
passed
pascoe
broad
body
and
moved
to
the
doorway
he
turned
with
his
hand
on
the
door
i
glad
i
going
he
said
you
always
bullied
me
and
always
hated
you
you
killed
my
mother
and
she
was
a
good
woman
you
can
have
this
house
to
yourself
you
and
grandfather
and
that
woman
he
nodded
contemptuously
at
pascoe
who
was
staring
at
him
fiercely
his
grandfather
was
fast
asleep
beneath
the
cushions
damn
you
said
westcott
very
quietly
you
always
been
ungrateful
i
did
kill
your
mother
but
she
was
always
a
tiresome
crying
he
stopped
crumbling
the
bread
and
suddenly
picked
up
a
table
knife
and
hurled
it
at
peter
his
hand
was
trembling
and
the
knife
quivering
was
fastened
to
the
door
pascoe
gasped
gawd
us
peter
quietly
closed
the
door
behind
him
and
went
up
to
his
room
he
was
in
no
way
disturbed
by
this
interview
his
relations
with
his
father
were
not
of
the
things
that
now
mattered
they
had
mattered
before
his
mother
died
they
had
mattered
whilst
his
father
had
been
somebody
strong
and
terrible
even
at
the
funeral
how
splendid
he
had
seemed
but
this
trembling
creature
who
drank
whisky
with
the
cook
was
some
one
who
concerned
peter
not
at
all
something
like
the
house
to
be
left
behind
there
was
an
old
black
bag
that
had
held
his
things
in
the
days
it
held
his
things
now
not
a
vast
number
only
the
black
suit
beside
the
blue
serge
one
that
he
was
going
to
wear
some
a
sponge
and
a
toothbrush
the
books
and
an
old
faded
photograph
of
his
mother
as
a
girl
nothing
like
that
white
face
that
he
had
seen
this
photograph
old
yellow
and
faded
but
a
girl
laughing
and
beautiful
after
all
his
most
precious
possession
then
when
the
bag
was
packed
he
sat
on
the
bed
swung
his
legs
and
thought
about
everything
he
was
nearly
eighteen
nearly
a
man
and
as
hard
as
rock
he
could
feel
the
muscles
swelling
there
was
no
fat
about
him
he
was
sound
all
over
he
looked
back
and
saw
the
things
that
stood
out
like
hills
above
the
plain
that
night
years
ago
when
he
was
whipped
the
day
that
he
first
met
zanti
the
first
day
at
school
the
day
when
he
said
to
cards
the
hour
at
the
end
of
it
all
when
they
hissed
him
that
last
evening
with
stephen
the
day
with
his
mother
and
then
quite
lately
that
afternoon
when
zanti
asked
him
to
go
to
london
the
little
girl
with
the
black
frock
on
the
hill
last
of
all
that
kiss
never
mind
with
whom
on
easter
morning
all
these
things
had
made
him
what
he
was
yes
and
all
the
people
frosted
moses
stephen
his
father
his
mother
bobby
galleon
cards
zanti
the
little
girl
as
he
swung
his
legs
he
knew
that
everything
that
he
did
afterwards
would
be
in
some
way
attached
to
these
earlier
things
and
these
earlier
people
he
had
brave
hopes
and
brave
ambitions
and
a
warm
heart
as
he
flung
himself
into
bed
it
speaks
well
for
him
that
on
the
night
before
he
set
out
on
his
adventure
he
slept
like
the
child
that
he
really
was
but
he
knew
that
he
would
wake
at
six
he
had
determined
that
it
should
be
so
and
the
clocks
were
striking
as
he
opened
his
eyes
it
was
very
dark
and
the
cocks
crowed
beyond
his
open
window
and
the
misty
morning
swept
in
and
blew
his
lighted
candle
up
and
down
he
dressed
in
the
blue
serge
suit
with
a
blue
tie
fastened
in
a
sailor
knot
he
leaned
out
of
his
window
and
tried
to
imagine
out
of
the
darkness
the
beloved
moor
then
he
took
his
black
bag
and
crept
downstairs
it
was
striking
six
as
he
came
softly
into
the
hall
there
he
saw
that
the
gas
was
flaring
and
that
his
father
was
standing
in
his
i
think
i
in
front
of
you
he
said
smiling
let
me
go
father
peter
said
very
white
and
putting
down
the
bag
be
damned
to
you
said
his
father
you
do
get
through
this
it
was
all
so
ludicrous
so
utterly
absurd
that
his
father
should
be
standing
in
his
on
this
very
cold
morning
under
the
flaring
gas
it
occurred
to
peter
that
as
he
wanted
to
laugh
at
this
zanti
could
not
have
been
right
about
his
lack
of
humour
peter
walked
up
to
his
father
and
his
father
caught
him
by
the
throat
westcott
was
still
in
spite
of
recent
excesses
sufficiently
strong
i
very
much
want
to
choke
you
he
said
peter
however
was
stronger
his
father
dropped
the
hold
of
his
throat
and
had
him
by
the
waist
but
his
hands
slipped
amongst
his
clothes
for
a
moment
they
swayed
together
and
peter
could
feel
the
heat
of
his
father
body
beneath
the
and
the
violent
beating
of
his
heart
it
was
immensely
ludicrous
moreover
there
now
appeared
on
the
stairs
pascoe
in
a
flannel
jacket
over
a
and
untidy
hair
about
her
ample
shoulders
the
lord
be
kind
she
cried
and
stood
staring
westcott
was
breathing
very
heavily
in
peter
face
and
their
eyes
were
so
close
together
that
peter
could
notice
how
bloodshot
his
father
were
god
damn
you
said
his
father
and
slipped
and
they
came
down
on
to
the
wood
floor
together
peter
rose
but
his
father
lay
there
breathing
heavily
god
damn
you
he
said
again
but
he
did
not
move
you
better
look
after
him
peter
said
turning
to
the
astounded
pascoe
as
he
moved
he
saw
a
surprising
sight
his
grandfather
door
was
opened
and
his
grandfather
who
had
not
been
on
his
feet
for
a
great
many
years
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
it
cackling
with
laughter
dressed
in
a
very
ugly
yellow
his
old
knotted
hands
clutching
the
sides
of
the
door
his
shrivelled
body
shaking
and
his
feet
in
large
red
slippers
dear
me
that
was
a
nasty
knock
he
chattered
and
so
peter
left
them
the
high
road
was
cool
and
fresh
and
dark
the
sea
sung
somewhere
below
amongst
the
rocks
and
peter
immediately
was
aware
that
he
was
leaving
cornwall
now
he
had
no
other
thought
the
streets
of
the
town
were
deserted
clean
smelling
of
the
fields
and
primroses
with
the
darkness
broken
by
dim
lamps
and
a
very
slender
moon
his
heart
was
full
his
throat
burning
he
crossed
the
and
suddenly
bent
down
and
kissed
the
worn
stones
of
the
tower
there
was
no
one
to
see
he
was
in
the
station
at
twenty
minutes
past
seven
the
platform
was
long
and
cold
and
deserted
but
in
the
was
zanti
enveloped
in
an
enormous
black
coat
ah
my
dear
boy
this
is
indeed
splendid
and
you
said
farewell
to
your
father
yes
i
said
to
every
one
he
answered
slowly
suddenly
he
would
have
given
all
the
wide
world
and
his
prospects
in
it
not
to
be
going
the
terrors
of
scaw
house
were
as
nothing
beside
that
little
grey
town
with
the
waves
breaking
on
the
jetty
the
grey
hill
above
it
the
twisted
cobbled
streets
the
morning
wind
blew
up
the
platform
the
train
rolled
in
there
were
porters
but
zanti
had
only
a
big
brown
bag
which
he
kept
with
him
soon
they
were
in
corners
facing
one
another
as
the
train
swept
past
the
tower
the
grey
dawn
was
breaking
into
blue
over
the
houses
that
rose
tier
by
tier
to
the
sky
over
the
grey
rolling
breakers
over
the
hills
beyond
cornwall
poor
peter
stared
with
passionate
eyes
as
the
vision
passed
london
soon
said
zanti
gaily
chapter
xi
all
kinds
of
fog
in
the
charing
cross
road
i
towards
the
middle
of
the
dim
afternoon
as
the
first
straight
pale
houses
began
to
close
in
upon
the
train
a
lady
and
gentleman
on
the
opposite
side
to
peter
were
discovered
by
him
as
he
awoke
from
a
long
sleep
to
be
talking
well
my
dear
lucy
how
we
are
ever
to
get
on
if
you
want
to
do
these
absurd
things
i
do
know
in
london
one
must
do
as
london
does
in
the
country
of
course
he
was
short
breathless
and
a
little
bald
the
lady
was
young
and
very
upset
but
henry
what
does
it
matter
what
does
it
matter
my
dear
lucy
in
london
everything
matters
she
was
excited
in
kensington
perhaps
but
in
london
allow
me
my
dear
lucy
to
decide
for
you
when
you
are
my
age
peter
went
to
sleep
again
ii
the
vast
station
was
very
dark
and
zanti
explained
that
this
was
because
outside
there
was
a
fog
the
fog
he
added
as
though
it
had
been
a
huge
and
ferocious
animal
is
very
yellow
and
has
eaten
up
london
it
will
take
us
a
very
long
time
to
find
our
to
peter
short
and
square
in
his
rough
suit
shouldering
his
bag
this
was
all
as
the
infernal
regions
the
vast
place
towered
high
into
misty
distances
above
him
trains
like
huge
beasts
stretched
their
limbs
into
infinity
screams
piercing
and
angry
broke
suddenly
the
voices
and
busy
movement
that
flooded
the
place
with
sounds
he
was
jostled
and
pushed
aside
and
people
turned
and
swore
at
him
and
a
heated
porter
ran
a
truck
into
his
legs
and
through
it
and
above
it
all
the
yellow
fog
came
twisting
in
coils
from
the
dark
street
beyond
and
every
one
coughed
and
choked
and
cursed
england
zanti
after
five
minutes
angry
pursuit
caught
a
reluctant
and
very
shabby
and
they
both
climbed
into
its
cavernous
depths
and
peter
nose
was
filled
with
something
that
had
leather
and
oranges
and
paper
bags
and
whisky
in
it
he
felt
exactly
as
though
zanti
looking
very
like
an
ogre
in
the
mysterious
yellow
light
with
his
bowler
on
the
back
of
his
head
and
mopping
his
face
with
a
huge
crimson
handkerchief
were
decoying
him
away
to
some
terrible
fastness
where
it
was
always
dark
and
smelly
and
indeed
that
first
vision
of
london
seen
through
the
grimy
windows
of
the
cab
was
terrible
enough
the
cab
moved
a
little
stopped
moved
again
it
seemed
that
they
would
be
there
for
ever
and
they
exchanged
no
word
there
were
no
buildings
to
be
seen
a
vast
wall
of
darkness
surrounded
him
and
ever
and
again
out
of
the
heart
of
it
a
great
cauldron
of
fire
flamed
and
by
the
side
of
it
there
were
wild
agitated
faces
and
again
darkness
on
every
side
of
the
stumbling
cab
there
was
noise
voices
shouting
women
screaming
the
rumbling
of
wheels
the
plunging
of
horses
hoofs
sometimes
things
brushed
against
their
cab
once
peter
thought
that
they
were
down
because
they
were
jerked
right
forward
against
the
opposite
seats
and
then
suddenly
in
the
most
wonderful
way
they
would
plunge
into
silence
a
silence
so
deep
and
cavernous
that
it
was
more
fearful
than
those
other
noises
had
been
and
the
yellow
darkness
seemed
to
crowd
upon
them
with
a
closer
eagerness
and
it
was
as
though
they
were
driving
over
the
edge
of
the
world
then
the
noises
returned
for
a
moment
the
fog
lifted
showing
houses
rising
like
rocks
from
the
sea
sheer
about
them
on
every
side
then
darkness
again
and
the
cab
stopped
with
a
jerk
ah
good
said
zanti
rolling
his
red
handkerchief
into
a
ball
we
are
my
young
friend
peter
after
you
before
him
a
light
faintly
glimmered
and
towards
this
after
stumbling
on
the
slippery
pavement
he
made
his
way
he
found
himself
in
a
bookshop
lighted
with
gas
that
hissed
and
spit
like
an
angry
cat
the
shop
was
low
and
stuffy
but
its
walls
were
covered
with
books
that
stretched
into
misty
fog
near
the
ceiling
behind
a
dingy
counter
a
man
was
sitting
this
man
struck
peter
attention
at
once
because
of
the
enormous
size
of
his
head
and
the
amount
of
hair
that
covered
it
starting
out
of
the
mist
and
obscurity
of
the
shop
this
head
looked
like
some
strange
fungus
and
from
the
heart
of
it
there
glittered
two
very
bright
eyes
peter
standing
awkwardly
in
the
middle
of
the
shop
gazed
at
this
head
and
was
speechless
outside
zanti
could
be
heard
disputing
with
the
cabman
you
can
go
and
be
damned
ze
bags
were
not
on
ze
outside
zat
is
plenty
for
your
pay
and
you
be
damned
the
shop
door
closed
with
a
bang
shutting
out
the
fog
and
zanti
filled
the
little
bookshop
he
seemed
taller
and
larger
than
he
had
been
in
cornwall
and
his
voice
was
sharper
the
head
removed
itself
from
the
counter
and
peter
saw
that
it
belonged
to
a
small
man
with
a
hump
who
came
forward
to
zanti
very
humbly
ah
gottfried
said
zanti
you
well
very
sir
answered
the
little
man
bowing
a
little
and
smiling
his
voice
was
guttural
with
a
very
slight
accent
this
is
peter
westcott
will
work
here
and
you
with
ze
books
is
a
friend
of
mine
and
you
will
be
kind
to
him
peter
zis
is
herr
gottfried
hanz
i
owe
much
ver
clever
they
shook
hands
and
peter
liked
the
pair
of
eyes
that
gazed
into
his
then
zanti
said
come
i
will
show
you
ze
rest
of
ze
place
it
is
not
a
mansion
you
will
indeed
it
was
not
behind
the
shop
there
was
a
room
brown
and
green
with
two
windows
that
looked
on
to
a
yard
so
zanti
said
there
was
no
furniture
in
it
save
a
table
and
some
chairs
a
woman
was
spreading
a
cloth
on
the
table
as
they
came
in
this
woman
had
grey
hair
that
escaped
its
pins
and
fell
untidily
about
her
shoulders
she
was
very
pale
tall
and
thin
and
her
most
striking
features
were
her
piercing
black
eyes
and
with
these
she
stared
at
peter
zis
is
dantzig
said
zanti
an
old
friend
peter
westcott
dantzig
will
work
wiz
the
woman
said
nothing
but
nodded
her
head
and
continued
her
work
they
passed
out
of
the
room
stairs
ran
both
up
and
down
what
is
down
there
asked
peter
ah
zat
is
ze
kitchen
said
zanti
laughing
upstairs
there
was
a
clean
and
neat
bedroom
with
a
large
bed
in
it
an
old
sofa
and
two
chairs
zis
is
where
i
sleep
said
zanti
for
a
night
or
two
until
you
discovered
a
lodging
you
shall
sleep
on
zat
sofa
zay
will
make
it
whilst
we
it
was
now
late
and
peter
was
very
very
tired
downstairs
there
was
much
bread
and
butter
and
bacon
and
eggs
and
beer
the
woman
waited
upon
them
but
they
were
all
very
silent
and
peter
was
too
sleepy
to
be
hungry
the
table
was
cleared
and
zanti
sat
smoking
his
pipe
and
talking
to
the
woman
peter
sat
there
nodding
and
he
thought
that
their
conversation
was
in
a
foreign
tongue
and
he
thought
that
they
looked
at
him
and
that
the
woman
was
angry
about
something
but
the
sleep
always
gained
upon
him
he
could
not
keep
it
away
at
last
a
hand
was
upon
his
shoulder
and
he
was
led
up
to
bed
he
tumbled
out
of
his
clothes
and
his
last
impression
was
of
zanti
standing
in
front
of
him
looking
vast
and
very
solemn
in
a
blue
cotton
peter
zanti
seemed
to
be
saying
you
see
in
me
one
two
a
hundred
men
all
my
life
i
seek
adventure
fun
and
i
find

but

then

i

good
friend
to

and
you
shall
only

shop

books
i
will
be
a
good
friend
then
it
seemed
that
zanti
kissed
peter
on
both
cheeks
blew
out
the
candle
and
climbed
into
his
huge
bed
soon
he
was
snoring
but
peter
could
not
be
sure
of
these
things
because
he
was
so
very
tired
that
he
did
not
know
whether
he
were
standing
on
his
head
or
his
heels
and
he
was
asleep
on
his
sofa
and
dreaming
about
the
strangest
and
most
confused
events
in
less
than
no
time
at
all
iii
and
then
how
wonderful
to
discover
on
waking
up
the
next
morning
that
it
was
a
beautiful
day
as
beautiful
a
day
as
any
that
cornwall
could
give
him
it
was
indeed
odd
after
the
great
darkness
of
the
afternoon
before
to
find
now
a
burning
blue
sky
bright
shining
pavements
and
the
pieces
of
iron
and
metal
on
the
cabs
glittering
as
they
rolled
along
the
streets
were
doubtless
delightful
but
peter
was
not
on
this
day
at
any
rate
to
see
very
much
of
them
he
was
handed
over
to
the
care
of
herr
gottfried
hanz
who
had
obviously
not
brushed
his
hair
when
he
got
up
in
the
morning
he
also
wore
large
blue
slippers
that
were
too
big
for
his
feet
and
clattered
behind
him
as
he
walked
whatever
light
there
might
be
in
the
street
outside
only
chinks
of
it
found
their
way
into
the
shop
and
the
hissed
and
flared
as
it
had
done
on
the
day
before
the
books
seemed
mistier
and
dustier
than
ever
and
peter
wondered
in
a
kind
of
despair
how
in
the
world
if
any
one
did
come
in
and
ask
for
anything
he
was
going
to
tell
them
whether
it
were
there
or
not
but
here
herr
gottfried
came
to
the
rescue
see
you
he
said
with
an
air
of
pride
it
is
thus
that
they
are
arranged
here
you
have
the
novel
brontë
bulwer
bunyan
the
pilgrim
progress
that
is
not
a
novel
but
it
is
near
enough
here
you
have
history
and
here
the
poets
and
here
philosophy
and
here
travel
it
will
all
be
simple
in
time
peter
eyes
spun
dizzily
to
the
heights
there
is
a
little
ladder
said
herr
gottfried
and
at
last
said
peter
timidly
may
i
read
when
there
is
no
one
here
herr
gottfried
looked
at
him
with
a
new
interest
you
like
reading
like
peter
voice
was
an
ecstasy
why
of
course
herr
gottfried
smiled
and
then
see
he
opened
the
shop
door
there
is
a
small
boy
james
who
is
supposed
to
look
after
these
these
were
the
and
boxes
outside
the
window
on
the
pavement
but
he
is
an
idle
boy
and
often
enough
he
is
not
there
and
then
we
must
have
the
door
open
and
you
must
watch
them
often
enough
this
seemed
a
favourite
phrase
of
his
these
gentlemen
this
with
great
scorn
will
turn
the
books
over
and
over
and
they
will
look
up
the
street
once
and
they
will
look
down
the
street
once
and
then
into
the
pocket
a
book
will
go
often
enough
he
added
looking
beyond
the
door
savagely
at
a
very
tired
and
tattered
lady
who
was
turning
the
lot
over
and
over
then
this
introductory
lesson
concluded
herr
gottfried
suddenly
withdrew
into
the
tangles
of
his
hair
and
retreated
behind
his
counter
through
the
open
door
there
came
the
most
entrancing
sound
and
the
bustle
of
the
street
was
loud
and
startling
bells
ringing
boys
shouting
wheels
rattling
and
beyond
these
immediate
notes
a
steady
hum
like
the
murmur
of
an
orchestra
heard
through
closed
doors
all
this
was
wonderful
enough
but
it
was
nothing
at
all
to
the
superlative
fascination
of
that
multitude
of
books
peter
found
a
hard
little
chair
in
a
dark
corner
and
sat
down
upon
it
here
he
was
in
the
very
heart
of
his
kingdom
he
could
never
read
all
the
books
in
this
place
if
he
lived
for
two
hundred
years
and
so
he
had
better
not
try
he
made
a
blind
dash
at
the
volumes
nearest
him
quietly
lest
he
should
disturb
herr
gottfried
who
seemed
very
busy
at
his
counter
and
secured
something
and
read
it
as
well
as
he
could
for
the
light
was
very
bad
it
was
called
the
true
and
faithful
experiences
of
the
reverend
james
scott
in
the
other
world
being
a
veracious
history
of
his
experiences
of
the
life
after
death
the
dust
rose
from
its
pages
in
little
clouds
and
tempted
him
to
sneeze
but
he
bit
his
lip
and
counted
forty
and
saved
the
situation
herr
gottfried
dealt
with
the
customers
that
morning
and
peter
stood
nervously
watching
him
the
customers
were
not
very
many
an
old
lady
who
wanted
something
to
read
caused
many
volumes
to
be
laid
before
her
and
finally
left
the
shop
without
buying
anything
a
young
man
with
spectacles
purchased
some
tattered
science
and
a
clergyman
some
sermons
a
thin
and
very
hungry
looking
man
entered
clutching
a
paper
parcel
these
were
books
he
wanted
to
sell
they
were
obviously
treasured
possessions
because
he
touched
them
when
they
were
laid
upon
the
counter
with
a
loving
hand
they
are
very
good
books
he
said
plaintively
three
shillings
said
herr
gottfried
the
hungry
man
sighed
five
shillings
he
said
they
are
worth
three
shillings
for
the
lot
said
herr
gottfried
it
is
very
little
said
the
hungry
man
but
he
took
the
money
and
went
out
sadly
once
their
came
a
magnificent
gentleman
that
is
he
looked
magnificent
in
the
distance
away
from
the
gas
jet
he
was
tall
with
a
high
hat
a
fine
moustache
and
a
tailcoat
he
had
melancholy
eyes
and
a
languid
air
peter
was
sorry
to
observe
on
a
closer
view
that
his
was
frayed
and
his
collar
not
very
clean
he
gave
herr
gottfried
a
languid
bow
and
passed
through
the
shop
into
the
room
beyond
guten
tag
herr
signer
said
herr
gottfried
with
deference
but
the
gentleman
had
already
disappeared
then
after
a
time
one
struck
and
peter
understood
that
if
he
would
place
himself
under
herr
gottfried
protection
he
should
be
led
to
an
establishment
where
for
a
small
sum
were
to
be
had
all
this
very
novel
and
delightful
and
peter
laid
down
the
experiences
of
the
reverend
james
scott
which
were
not
at
present
very
thrilling
and
followed
his
guide
into
the
street
peter
was
still
wondering
where
herr
gottfried
had
put
his
blue
slippers
and
whence
had
come
the
large
flat
boots
and
the
brown
and
faded
squash
hat
when
he
was
suddenly
in
a
little
dark
street
with
the
houses
hanging
forward
as
though
they
were
listening
and
any
number
of
clothes
dangling
from
the
window
sills
and
waving
about
as
though
their
owners
were
still
inside
them
and
kicking
vigorously
although
the
street
was
dark
it
was
full
of
noise
and
a
blaze
of
light
at
the
other
end
of
it
proclaimed
more
civilised
quarters
trafalgar
square
in
fact
at
no
great
distance
gerade
aus
said
herr
gottfried
and
pushed
open
a
swinging
door
peter
followed
him
into
the
most
amazing
babel
of
voices
a
confusion
and
a
roaring
an
atmosphere
thick
with
smoke
and
steam
and
a
scent
in
the
air
as
though
ten
thousand
were
cooking
there
before
his
eyes
by
the
door
a
neat
stout
little
woman
hung
all
over
with
lockets
and
medallions
as
though
she
were
wearing
all
the
prizes
that
the
famous
had
ever
won
was
sitting
in
a
little
box
with
a
glass
front
to
it
bon
jour
monsieur
tag
meine
gnädige
all
down
the
room
by
the
wall
ran
long
tables
black
with
age
and
grime
men
of
every
age
and
nationality
were
eating
drinking
smoking
and
talking
some
of
them
knew
herr
gottfried
some
did
not
wie
gehts
gottfried
and
herr
gottfried
planting
his
flat
feet
like
dead
weights
in
front
of
him
taking
off
his
hat
and
running
his
fingers
through
his
hair
smiled
at
some
spoke
to
others
and
at
last
found
a
little
corner
at
the
end
of
the
room
a
corner
comparatively
quiet
but
most
astoundingly
smelly
peter
sat
down
and
recovered
his
breath
how
far
away
now
was
treliss
with
its
cobbled
street
and
the
grey
hill
with
the
giant
finger
pointing
solemnly
to
the
sky
i
have
no
money
he
said
the
master
has
given
me
this
for
you
herr
gottfried
said
handing
him
two
sovereigns
he
says
it
is
in
advance
for
the
the
beer
and
bread
were
ordered
and
then
for
a
time
they
sat
in
silence
peter
was
turning
in
his
mind
a
thousand
questions
that
he
would
like
to
ask
but
he
was
still
afraid
of
his
strange
companion
and
he
felt
a
little
as
though
he
were
some
human
volcano
that
might
at
any
moment
burst
forth
and
cover
him
with
furious
disaster
then
herr
gottfried
said
and
so
you
care
for
reading
what
do

read
what
had
peter

mentioned
timidly

homer

schubert
the
beer
but
not
this
beer
no
helles
beautiful
helles
with
the
sun
in
it
he
had
forgotten
peter
and
peter
did
not
understand
anything
that
he
said
but
he
sat
there
with
his
eyes
wide
open
and
felt
assured
that
it
was
all
very
useful
to
him
and
very
important
the
inferno
continued
around
them
the
air
grew
thicker
with
smoke
a
began
to
play
at
the
door
draughts
and
dominoes
rattled
against
the
long
wooden
tables
ah
this
was
indeed
london
peter
was
so
greatly
moved
that
his
hunger
left
him
and
it
was
with
difficulty
that
the
was
finished
iv
during
the
three
days
that
followed
peter
learnt
a
very
great
deal
about
the
bookshop
at
night
he
still
slept
in
zanti
bedroom
but
it
was
only
a
temporary
pitching
of
tents
during
these
days
whilst
he
was
a
stranger
and
baffled
by
the
noise
and
confusion
already
his
immediate
surroundings
had
ceased
to
be
a
mystery
he
had
as
it
were
taken
them
to
himself
and
seated
himself
in
the
midst
of
them
with
surprising
ease
treliss
scaw
house
his
father
had
slipped
back
into
an
unintelligible
distance
he
felt
that
they
still
mattered
to
him
and
that
the
time
would
most
certainly
come
when
they
would
matter
to
him
even
more
but
they
were
not
of
immediate
concern
the
memory
of
his
mother
was
closer
to
him
but
in
this
discovery
of
london
he
was
amazingly
happy
happier
than
he
had
ever
been
in
all
his
life
and
younger
too
there
were
a
great
many
things
that
he
wished
to
know
a
great
many
questions
that
he
wished
to
ask
but
for
the
moment
he
was
content
to
rest
and
to
grasp
what
he
could
see
in
a
day
he
seemed
to
understand
the
way
that
the
books
went
and
not
only
that
but
even
the
places
where
the
individual
books
were
lodged
he
did
not
of
course
know
anything
about
the
contents
of
the
books
but
their
titles
gave
them
in
his
mind
human
existence
so
that
he
thought
of
them
as
actual
persons
living
in
different
parts
of
the
shop
there
was
for
instance
the
triumph
of
lady
audley
an
old
lady
with
a
trembling
voice
and
a
very
sharp
pair
of
eyes
wished
for
a
secondhand
copy
i
very
sorry
madame
began
herr
gottfried
but
i
afraid
we
have
i
think
said
peter
timidly
and
he
climbed
the
little
ladder
and
brought
the
book
down
from
a
misty
corner
herr
gottfried
was
indeed
amazed
at
him
he
said
very
little
but
he
was
certainly
amazed
indeed
with
the
exception
of
the
interval
he
scarcely
spoke
throughout
the
day
peter
began
to
look
forward
to
one
for
then
the
german
in
the
midst
of
the
babel
and
the
smoke
continued
the
educating
progress
and
even
read
goethe
poetry
aloud
translating
it
into
the
strangest
english
and
developed
peter
conception
of
homer
into
an
alluring
and
fascinating
picture
of
london
itself
during
these
days
peter
saw
nothing
at
eight
in
the
evening
the
shutters
were
put
up
by
the
disobedient
james
and
the
shop
retired
for
the
night
herr
gottfried
shuffled
away
to
some
hidden
of
his
own
and
peter
found
supper
waiting
for
him
in
the
room
at
the
back
he
ate
this
alone
for
zanti
was
not
there
and
during
these
three
days
he
was
hardly
visible
at
all
he
was
up
in
the
morning
before
peter
was
and
he
came
to
bed
when
peter
was
already
asleep
the
boy
was
not
however
certain
that
his
master
was
always
away
when
he
seemed
to
be
he
appeared
suddenly
at
the
most
surprising
moments
smiling
and
cheerful
as
ever
and
with
no
sign
of
hurry
about
him
he
always
gave
peter
a
nod
and
a
kind
word
and
asked
him
how
the
books
were
going
and
patted
him
on
the
shoulder
but
he
was
away
almost
as
soon
as
he
was
there
one
strange
thing
was
the
number
of
people
that
came
into
the
bookshop
with
no
intention
whatever
of
having
anything
to
do
with
the
books
indeed
they
paid
no
heed
to
the
bookshop
and
after
flinging
a
word
at
herr
gottfried
they
would
pass
straight
into
the
room
beyond
and
as
far
as
peter
could
see
never
came
out
again
the
gentleman
called
by
herr
gottfried
herr
signor
was
one
of
these
persons
however
peter
happy
enough
in
the
excitement
of
the
present
asking
no
questions
and
only
at
night
before
he
fell
asleep
lying
on
his
sofa
listening
to
the
sounds
in
the
street
below
him
watching
the
reflections
of
the
gas
light
flung
up
by
the
street
lamps
on
to
the
walls
of
his
room
he
would
wonder
and
so
wondering
he
was
asleep
and
then
on
the
fourth
day
something
happened
it
was
growing
late
and
peter
underneath
the
gas
jet
was
buried
in
pope
homer
a
knock
on
the
door
and
the
postman
entered
with
the
letters
as
a
rule
herr
gottfried
took
them
but
on
this
afternoon
he
had
left
the
shop
in
peter
hands
for
half
an
hour
whilst
he
went
out
to
see
a
friend
peter
took
the
letters
and
immediately
the
letter
on
the
top
of
the
pile
zanti
post
was
always
a
large
one
set
his
heart
thumping
the
handwriting
was
the
handwriting
of
stephen
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
it
no
possible
doubt
peter
had
seen
that
writing
many
times
and
he
had
always
kept
the
letter
that
stephen
had
written
to
him
when
he
first
went
to
dawson
to
other
eyes
it
might
seem
an
ordinary
enough
hand
rough
and
uneducated
and
sprawling
anybody
hand
but
peter
knew
that
there
could
be
no
mistake
the
sight
of
the
letter
as
it
lay
there
on
the
counter
swept
away
the
shop
the
books
london
he
sat
looking
at
it
with
a
longing
stronger
than
any
longing
that
he
had
ever
known
to
see
the
writer
again
he
lived
once
more
through
that
night
on
the
farm
perhaps
at
that
moment
he
felt
suddenly
his
loneliness
here
in
this
huge
and
tempestuous
london
here
in
this
dark
bookshop
with
so
many
people
going
in
or
out
he
rubbed
the
sleeves
of
his
blue
serge
suit
because
they
made
him
feel
like
treliss
and
he
sat
with
eyes
staring
into
the
dark
thinking
of
stephen
that
evening
just
as
he
was
going
up
to
bed
zanti
came
in
and
greeted
him
with
his
accustomed
cheerfulness
going
to
bed
peter
ah
good
peter
stopped
hesitating
by
the
door
oh
i
wonder
he
said
and
stopped
yes
said
zanti
looking
at
him
oh
well
it
nothing
then
he
blurted
out
i
saw
a
letter
i
could
help
it
a
letter
from
stephen
this
afternoon
they
came
when
herr
gottfried
was
out
and
i
wanted
i
want
dreadfully
to
hear
about
him
if
you
could
tell
me
for
an
instant
zanti
large
eyes
closed
until
they
seemed
to
be
no
larger
than
then
they
opened
again

brought
me
to
see

was
quite
a
kid

very
fond
of

glad

the
boy
is
mad
what
has
come
to

but

my
afternoon
he
took
a
bundle
of
letters
out
of
his
pocket
and
showed
them
to
peter
the
boy

the
one
in
stephen
handwriting

may
read
it
said
zanti
smiling
peter
read
it
he
could
not
understand
it
and
it
was
signed
john
simmons
but
it
was
certainly
in
stephen
handwriting
thank
you
said
peter
in
rather
a
quivering
voice
and
he
turned
away
gulping
down
his
disappointment
zanti
patted
him
on
the
shoulder
that
right
my
boy
ah
i
expect
you
miss
your
friend
you
will
be
lonely
here

few
days

time
for
you
to
find
a
place
to
live
and
i
have
talked
wiz
a
friend
of
mine
a
ver
good
friend
who
lived
for
many
years
in
a
where

is
a
room
that

just
do
for
you
cheap
pleasant
people
yes

show
you
the
place
there

will
friends
peter
smiled
thanked
zanti
and
went
to
bed
but
his
dreams
were
confused
that
night
it
seemed
to
him
that
london
was
a
huge
room
with
closing
walls
and
that
ever
they
came
closer
and
closer
and
that
he
screamed
for
stephen
and
they
would
not
let
stephen
come
to
him
and
bells
were
ringing
and
zanti
with
a
lighted
candle
in
his
hands
was
creeping
down
those
dark
stairs
that
led
to
the
kitchen
and
he
might
have
stopped
those
closing
walls
but
he
would
not
then
suddenly
peter
was
running
down
the
sea
road
above
treliss
and
the
waves
were
sounding
furiously
below
him
his
father
was
there
waiting
for
him
sternly
at
the
road
end
and
herr
gottfried
with
a
homer
in
one
hand
and
his
blue
shoes
in
the
other
sat
watching
them
out
of
his
bright
eyes
his
father
was
waiting
to
kill
him
and
pascoe
was
at
his
elbow
peter
screamed
the
sweat
was
pouring
off
his
forehead
his
throat
was
tight
with
agony
when
suddenly
by
his
side
was
old
frosted
moses
with
his
flowing
beard
it
is
life
that
matters
he
was
whispering
in
his
old
cracked
voice
but
the
courage
that
you
bring
to
the
figures
faded
the
light
grew
broader
and
broader
and
peter
woke
to
find
zanti
by
the
aid
of
a
candle
climbing
into
bed
but
some
time
passed
before
he
had
courage
to
fall
asleep
again
chapter
xii
brocketts
its
character
and
especially
brockett
i
on
the
next
afternoon
about
six
zanti
accompanied
by
the
languid
and
shabby
gentleman
whom
peter
had
noticed
before
appeared
in
the
shop
signor
rastelli
said
zanti
and
the
languid
gentleman
shook
hands
with
peter
as
though
he
were
conferring
a
great
benefit
upon
him
and
he
hoped
peter
would
forget
it
zis
said
zanti
is
my
young
friend
peter
westcott
whom
i
love
as
if
were
my
own
son
signor
rastelli
he
continued
turning
to
peter
i
known
him
for
very
many
years
and
i
can
only
say
zat
ze
longer
i
known
him
ze
more
admirable
i
thought
the
gentleman
took
off
his
tall
hat
stroked
it
put
it
on
again
and
looked
with
his
languid
eyes
at
peter
and
continued
zanti
cheerfully
conscious
perhaps
that
he
was
carrying
all
the
conversation
on
his
own
shoulders
will
take
you
to
a
where
has
been
for
many
years
signor
ten
said
that
gentleman
for
ten
years
every
comfort
zere
a
little
room
tells
me
where
you
will
be
and
all
your
food
and
friendship
for
one
pound
a
week
there
he
ended
triumphantly
thank
you
very
much
said
peter
but
he
did
not
altogether
like
the
look
of
the
seedily
dressed
gentleman
and
would
much
rather
have
stayed
with
zanti
he
had
packed
his
black
bag
in
readiness
and
now
he
fetched
it
and
after
promising
to
be
in
the
shop
at
eight
the
next
morning
started
off
with
his
melancholy
guide
the
lamps
were
coming
out
and
a
silence
that
often
falls
upon
london
just
before
sunset
had
come
down
upon
the
traffic
and
the
people
windows
caught
the
departing
flame
held
it
for
an
instant
and
sank
into
grey
twilight
i
know
what
you
thinking
about
me
peter
companion
suddenly
said
he
was
walking
very
fast
as
though
trying
to
catch
something
i
know
you
do
like
me
i
could
see
it
at
once
i
never
make
a
mistake
about
those
things
you
were
saying
to
yourself
does
that
horrible
stranger
want
to
come
interfering
with
me
for
indeed
i
was
said
peter
breathlessly
because
the
bag
was
so
heavy
and
they
were
walking
so
fast
oh
yes
you
were
never
mind
i
not
a
popular
man
and
when
you
know
me
better
you
like
me
still
less
that
always
the
way
i
affect
people
and
always
with
the
best
intentions
and
you
were
thinking
too
that
you
never
saw
anything
less
italian
than
i
am
and
you
sure
my
name
brown
or
smith
and
indeed
it
true
that
i
was
born
in
clapham
but
my
parents
were
italians
refugees
you
know
although
i
sure
i
do
know
what
from
and
every
one
calls
me
the
signor
and
so
there
you
are
and
i
do
see
how
i
to
help
it
but
that
just
me
all
over
always
fighting
against
the
tide
but
i
do
complain
i
all
this
said
very
rapidly
and
in
a
melancholy
way
as
though
tears
were
not
very
far
off
then
he
suddenly
added
let
me
carry
your
bag
for
no
thank
you
said
peter
laughing
i
can
manage
ah
well
you
look
strong
said
the
signor
appreciatively
i
envy
you
i
sure
never
had
a
day
health
myself
but
i
do
by
this
time
they
had
passed
the
british
museum
and
were
entering
into
the
shadows
of
bloomsbury
at
this
hour
when
the
lamps
and
the
stars
are
coming
out
and
the
sun
is
going
in
bloomsbury
has
an
air
of
melancholy
that
is
peculiarly
its
own
the
dark
grey
houses
stand
as
a
perpetual
witness
of
those
people
that
have
found
life
too
hard
for
them
and
have
been
compelled
to
give
in
the
streets
of
those
melancholy
squares
seen
beneath
flickering
lamp
light
and
a
wan
moon
protest
against
all
gaiety
of
spirit
and
urge
resignation
and
a
mournful
acquiescence
bloomsbury
is
life
on
thirty
shillings
a
week
without
the
drama
of
starvation
or
the
tragedy
of
the
embankment
but
with
all
the
ignominy
of
making
ends
meet
under
the
stern
and
relentless
eye
of
a
keeper
but
of
all
the
sad
and
unhappy
squares
in
bloomsbury
the
saddest
is
bennett
square
it
is
shut
in
by
all
the
other
bloomsbury
squares
and
is
further
than
any
of
them
from
the
lights
and
traffic
of
popular
streets
there
are
only
four
lamp
posts
there
one
at
each
corner
and
between
these
patches
of
light
everything
is
darkness
and
desolation
every
house
in
bennett
square
is
a
and
no
is
brockett
mrs
brockett
is
a
very
terrifying
but
lovable
woman
said
the
signor
darkly
and
peter
whose
spirits
had
sunk
lower
and
ever
lower
as
he
stumbled
through
the
dark
streets
felt
at
the
sound
of
this
threatening
prophecy
entirely
miserable
no
is
certainly
the
grimiest
of
the
houses
in
bennett
square
it
is
tall
and
built
of
that
grey
stone
that
takes
the
mind
of
the
observer
back
to
those
school
precincts
of
his
youth
it
is
a
thin
house
not
broad
and
fat
and
comfortably
bulging
but
rather
flinging
a
spiteful
glance
at
the
house
that
squeezed
it
in
on
either
side
it
is
like
a
soured
elderly
caustic
old
maid
unhappy
in
its
own
experiences
and
determined
to
make
every
one
else
unhappy
in
theirs
peter
of
course
did
not
see
these
things
because
it
was
very
dark
but
he
wished
he
had
not
come
the
signor
had
a
key
of
his
own
and
peter
was
soon
inside
a
hall
that
smelt
of
oilcloth
and
the
cooking
of
beef
the
gas
was
burning
but
the
only
things
that
really
benefited
from
its
light
were
a
long
row
of
mournful
black
coats
that
hung
against
the
wall
peter
sneezed
and
was
suddenly
conscious
of
an
enormous
woman
whom
he
knew
by
instinct
to
be
brockett
she
was
truly
enormous
she
stood
facing
him
like
some
avenging
fate
she
had
the
body
of
a
man
flat
straight
broad
her
black
hair
carefully
parted
down
the
middle
was
brushed
back
and
bound
into
hard
black
coils
low
down
over
the
neck
she
stood
there
looking
down
on
them
her
arms
akimbo
her
legs
apart
her
eyes
were
black
and
deep
set
her
cheek
bones
very
prominent
her
nose
thin
and
sharp
her
black
dress
caught
in
a
little
at
the
waist
fell
otherwise
in
straight
folds
to
her
feet
there
was
a
faint
moustache
on
her
upper
lip
her
hands
with
long
white
slender
fingers
were
beautiful
lying
straight
by
her
side
against
the
stuff
of
her
dress
well
she
said
and
her
voice
was
deep
like
a
man
good
evening
good
evening
he
took
off
his
hat
and
gave
her
a
deep
bow
this
is
the
young
gentleman
westcott
of
whom
i
spoke
to
you
this
well
how
are
you
westcott
her
words
were
sharply
clipped
and
had
the
resonance
of
coins
as
they
rang
in
the
air
quite
well
thank
you
said
peter
and
he
noticed
in
spite
of
his
dismay
at
her
appearance
that
the
clasp
of
her
hand
was
strong
and
friendly
florence
will
show
you
your
room
westcott
it
is
a
pound
a
week
including
your
meals
and
attendance
and
the
use
of
the
general
if
you
do
not
like
it
you
must
tell
me
and
we
will
wish
one
another
good
evening
if
you
do
like
it
i
shall
do
my
best
to
make
you
peter
found
afterwards
that
this
was
her
invariable
manner
of
addressing
a
it
could
scarcely
be
called
a
warm
welcome
she
turned
and
called
florence
and
a
diminutive
in
size
but
spotless
in
appearance
suddenly
appeared
from
nowhere
at
all
as
it
seemed
to
peter
he
followed
this
girl
up
many
flights
of
stairs
on
every
side
of
him
were
doors
and
once
and
again
gas
flared
above
him
it
was
all
very
cold
and
gusts
of
wind
passed
up
and
down
whisking
in
and
out
of
the
oilcloth
and
peter
thought
that
he
had
never
seen
so
many
closed
doors
in
his
life
at
last
they
came
to
an
end
of
the
stairs
and
there
with
a
skylight
covering
the
passage
outside
was
his
room
it
was
certainly
small
and
the
window
looked
out
on
a
dismal
little
piece
of
garden
far
below
and
a
great
number
of
roofs
and
chimneys
and
at
last
a
high
dome
rising
like
a
black
cloud
in
the
farther
distance
it
was
spotlessly
clean
i
think
it
will
do
very
well
thank
you
said
peter
and
he
put
down
his
black
bag
do
you
said
the
maid
there
a
bell
she
said
pointing
and
the
meal
at
seving
she
disappeared
he
spent
the
time
very
cheerfully
taking
the
things
out
of
the
black
bag
and
arranging
them
he
had
suddenly
as
was
natural
in
him
forgotten
the
dismal
approach
to
the
house
the
overwhelming
appearance
of
brockett
his
recent
loneliness
here
at
last
was
a
little
spot
that
he
could
for
a
time
at
any
rate
call
his
own
he
could
come
at
any
time
of
the
evening
and
shut
his
door
and
be
alone
here
master
of
everything
that
he
surveyed
perhaps
and
the
thought
sent
the
blood
to
his
cheeks
it
was
here
that
he
would
write
he
looked
about
the
room
lovingly
it
was
quite
bare
except
for
the
bed
the
washing
stand
and
a
chair
and
there
was
no
but
he
arranged
the
books
david
copperfield
don
quixote
henry
lessingham
the
roads
the
downs
on
the
window
sill
and
the
little
faded
photograph
of
his
mother
on
the
ledge
above
the
washing
basin
he
had
scarcely
finished
doing
these
things
when
there
was
a
tap
on
his
door
he
opened
it
and
found
the
signor
no
longer
in
a
but
in
a
short
faded
blue
jacket
that
made
him
look
shabbier
than
ever
excuse
not
intruding
i
hope
he
looked
gloomily
round
the
room
everything
all
right
very
nice
said
peter
ah
you
like
it
at
first
but
never
mind
wonderful
woman
brockett
i
expect
you
were
alarmed
just
i
was
a
little
admitted
peter
ah
well
we
all
are
at
first
but
you
get
over
that
you
love
her
every
one
loves
her
by
the
way
he
pushed
his
hand
through
his
hair
what
i
came
about
was
to
tell
you
that
we
all
foregather
as
you
might
say
in
the
before
dinner
yes
and
i
like
to
introduce
you
to
my
wife
the
signora
not
italian
you
know
but
you
like
her
better
than
me
every
one
agreed
that
hers
is
a
nicer
peter
trembling
a
little
at
the
thought
of
more
strangers
followed
the
signer
downstairs
and
found
in
the
middle
of
one
of
the
dark
landings
looking
as
though
she
had
been
left
there
by
some
one
and
completely
forgotten
a
little
wisp
of
a
woman
with
bright
yellow
hair
and
a
straw
coloured
dress
and
this
was
the
signora
this
lady
shook
hands
with
him
in
a
frightened
tearful
way
and
made
choking
noises
all
the
way
downstairs
and
this
distressed
peter
very
much
until
he
discovered
that
she
had
a
passion
for
cough
drops
which
she
kept
in
her
pocket
in
a
little
tin
box
and
sucked
perpetually
the
signor
drove
his
wife
and
peter
before
him
into
the
this
was
a
very
room
with
any
number
of
brilliant
purple
vases
on
the
mantelpiece
a
pink
a
great
number
of
shining
pictures
in
the
most
splendid
gilt
frames
and
in
the
middle
of
the
room
a
bright
green
settee
with
red
cushions
on
it
on
this
settee
which
was
round
with
a
space
in
the
middle
of
it
like
a
circus
several
persons
were
seated
but
there
was
apparently
no
conversation
they
all
looked
up
at
the
opening
of
the
door
and
peter
was
so
dazzled
by
the
bright
colour
of
the
room
that
it
was
some
time
before
he
could
collect
his
thoughts
but
the
signor
beckoned
to
him
and
he
followed
allow
me
monogue
said
the
signor
to
introduce
to
you
peter
the
lady
in
question
was
stout
and
muffled
in
shawls
she
extended
him
a
haughty
finger
there
followed
then
miss
norah
monogue
a
girl
with
a
pleasant
smile
and
untidy
hair
miss
dall
a
lady
with
a
very
stiff
back
a
face
like
an
interrogation
mark
because
her
eyebrows
went
up
in
a
point
and
a
very
tight
black
dress
herbert
crumley
and
peter
crumley
two
short
thin
gentlemen
with
wizened
and
anxious
faces
they
were
obviously
brothers
because
they
were
exactly
alike
and
and
tressiter
two
cheerful
people
who
sat
very
close
together
as
though
they
were
cold
all
these
people
shook
hands
agreeably
with
peter
but
made
no
remarks
and
he
stood
awkwardly
looking
at
the
purple
vases
and
wishing
that
something
would
happen
something
happen
the
door
was
very
softly
and
slowly
opened
and
a
little
woman
came
hurrying
in
she
had
white
hair
and
glasses
were
dangling
on
the
end
of
her
nose
and
she
wore
a
very
old
and
shabby
black
silk
dress
she
looked
round
with
an
agitated
air
i
do
know
why
it
is
she
said
with
a
little
chirrup
like
a
bird
but
i
late
always
then
she
did
an
amazing
thing
she
walked
to
the
green
settee
and
sat
down
between
miss
dall
the
lady
with
the
tight
dress
and
monogue
she
then
took
out
of
one
pocket
an
orange
and
out
of
another
a
piece
of
newspaper
i
must
have
my
orange
you
know
she
said
looking
gaily
round
on
every
one
she
spread
the
newspaper
on
her
knee
and
then
peeled
the
orange
very
slowly
and
with
great
care
the
silence
was
maintained
no
one
spoke
then
suddenly
the
signor
darted
forward
oh
lazarus
i
must
introduce
you
to
madame
new
guest
how
do
you
do
the
old
lady
chirruped
oh
but
my
fingers
are
all
over
orange
never
mind
we
smile
at
one
another
i
hope
you
like
the
place
i
sure
i
always
have
an
orange
before
dinner
they
got
used
to
me
you
know
we
all
got
our
little
peter
did
not
know
what
to
say
and
was
wondering
whether
he
ought
to
relieve
the
old
lady
of
her
orange
peel
at
which
she
was
gazing
rather
helplessly
when
a
bell
rang
and
florence
appeared
at
the
door
dinner
she
said
laconically
a
procession
was
formed
monogue
with
her
shawls
sweeping
behind
her
sailed
in
front
and
peter
brought
up
the
rear
lazarus
put
the
orange
peel
into
the
newspaper
and
placed
it
all
carefully
in
her
pocket
brockett
was
sitting
more
like
a
soldier
than
ever
at
the
head
of
the
table
mutton
was
in
front
of
her
and
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
on
the
table
cloth
but
cruets
and
three
dusty
and
melancholic
palms
peter
found
that
he
was
sitting
between
lazarus
and
miss
dall
and
that
he
was
not
expected
to
talk
it
was
apparent
indeed
that
the
regularity
with
which
every
one
met
every
one
at
this
hour
of
the
day
during
months
and
months
of
the
year
negatived
any
polite
necessity
of
cordiality
or
genial
spirits
when
any
one
spoke
it
was
crossly
and
in
considerable
irritation
and
although
the
food
was
consumed
with
great
eagerness
on
everybody
part
the
faces
of
the
company
were
obviously
anxious
to
express
the
fact
that
the
food
was
worse
than
ever
and
they
would
stand
it
another
minute
they
all
did
stand
it
however
and
peter
thought
that
they
were
all
secretly
rather
happy
and
contented
during
most
of
the
meal
no
one
spoke
to
him
and
as
he
was
very
hungry
this
did
not
matter
opposite
him
all
down
the
side
of
the
room
were
dusty
grey
pillars
and
between
these
pillars
heavy
dark
green
curtains
were
hanging
this
had
the
effect
of
muffling
and
crushing
the
conversation
and
quite
forbidding
anybody
to
be
cheerful
in
any
circumstances
lazarus
indeed
chirruped
along
comfortably
and
happily
for
the
most
part
to
herself
as
for
instance
i
am
orangy
but
then
i
was
late
and
could
finish
it
dear
me
it
mutton
again
i
really
must
tell
madame
about
it
and
there
nothing
so
nice
as
beef
and
yorkshire
pudding
is
there
dear
me
would
you
mind
young
man
just
asking
dear
miss
dall
to
pass
the
salt
spoon
she
left
that
behind
i
the
thank
she
also
hummed
to
herself
at
times
and
made
her
bread
into
little
hard
pellets
which
she
flicked
across
the
table
with
her
thumb
at
no
one
in
particular
and
in
sheer
absence
of
mind
the
two
crumleys
were
sitting
opposite
to
her
and
they
accepted
the
little
charge
of
shot
with
all
the
placid
equanimity
bred
of
ancient
custom
peter
noticed
other
things
he
noticed
that
monogue
was
an
exceedingly
and
selfish
woman
and
that
she
bullied
the
pleasant
girl
with
the
untidy
hair
throughout
the
meal
and
that
the
girl
took
it
all
in
the
easiest
possible
way
he
noticed
that
brockett
dealt
with
each
of
her
company
in
turn
one
remark
apiece
and
always
in
that
stern
deep
voice
with
the
strangely
beautiful
musical
note
in
it
to
himself
she
said
well
westcott
i
pleased
sure
that
everything
is
to
your
satisfaction
and
listened
gravely
to
his
assurance
to
miss
dall
well
miss
ball
i
looked
at
the
book
you
lent
me
and
could
find
any
sense
in
it
i
to
tressiter
i
had
little
minnie
with
me
for
half
an
hour
this
evening
and
i
sure
a
better
behaved
child
never
breathed
and
so
on
once
miss
dall
turned
upon
him
sharply
with
i
suppose
you
never
go
and
hear
the
rev
valdwell
and
peter
had
to
confess
ignorance
really
well
it
do
you
young
men
a
world
of
he
assured
her
that
he
would
go
i
will
lend
you
a
volume
of
his
sermons
if
you
would
care
to
read
peter
said
that
he
would
be
delighted
the
meal
was
soon
over
and
every
one
returned
to
the
they
sat
about
in
a
desolate
way
and
peter
discovered
afterwards
that
brockett
liked
every
one
to
be
there
together
for
half
an
hour
to
encourage
friendly
relations
that
object
could
scarcely
be
said
to
be
achieved
because
there
was
very
little
conversation
and
many
anxious
glances
were
flung
at
the
clocks
brockett
however
sat
sternly
in
a
chair
and
sewed
and
no
one
ventured
to
leave
the
room
one
pleasant
thing
happened
peter
was
standing
by
the
window
turning
over
some
fashion
papers
of
an
ancient
date
when
he
saw
that
miss
monogue
was
at
his
elbow
now
that
she
was
close
to
him
he
observed
that
she
looked
thin
and
delicate
her
dress
was
worn
and
she
looked
as
though
she
ought
to
be
wrapped
up
warmly
and
taken
care
of
but
her
eyes
were
large
and
soft
and
grey
and
although
her
wrists
looked
strangely
white
and
sharp
through
her
black
dress
her
hands
were
beautiful
her
voice
was
soft
with
an
irish
brogue
lingering
pleasantly
amongst
her
words
i
hope
that
you
will
like
being
i
sure
i
shall
he
said
smiling
he
felt
grateful
to
her
for
talking
to
him
you
very
fortunate
to
have
come
to
brockett
straight
away
you
may
think
so
now
because
brockett
is
alarming
at
first
and
we
none
of
us
she
looked
round
her
with
a
little
laugh
can
strike
the
as
very
cheerful
company
but
really
madame
has
a
heart
of
gold
you
find
that
out
in
time
she
had
a
terribly
hard
time
of
it
herself
and
i
believe
it
a
great
struggle
to
keep
things
going
now
but
she
helped
all
kinds
of
people
in
her
peter
looked
with
new
eyes
at
the
lady
so
sternly
sewing
you
do
know
miss
monogue
went
on
in
her
soft
pleasant
voice
how
horrible
these
can
be
mother
and
i
have
tried
a
good
many
but
here
people
stay
for
ever
a
pretty
good
testimony
to
it
i
think
and
then
you
know
she
never
lets
any
one
stay
here
if
she
does
like
them
so
that
prevents
scoundrels
there
been
one
or
two
but
she
always
found
them
out
and
i
believe
she
keeps
old
lazarus
quite
free
of
she
paused
and
then
she
added
and
there
no
one
here
who
has
found
life
pretty
hard
that
gives
us
a
kind
of
freemasonry
you
know
the
tressiters
for
instance
they
have
three
children
and
he
has
been
out
of
work
for
months
sometimes
there
such
a
frightened
look
in
her
eyes
but
you
must
think
that
we
melancholy
here
she
went
on
more
happily
we
get
a
lot
of
happiness
out
of
it
he
looked
at
her
and
remembering
monogue
at
dinner
and
seeing
now
how
delicate
the
girl
looked
thought
that
she
must
have
a
very
considerable
amount
of
pluck
on
her
own
account
and
you
she
said
have
you
only
just
come
up
to
london
yes
he
answered
i
in
a
bookseller
shop
a
bookseller
i
only
been
in
london
a
few
days
it
all
very
exciting
for
me
and
a
little
confusing
at
i
sure
you
get
on
she
said
you
look
so
strong
and
confident
and
happy
i
envy
you
your
strength
one
can
do
so
much
if
one
got
he
felt
almost
ashamed
of
his
rough
suit
his
ragged
build
well
always
been
in
the
country
he
said
a
little
apologetically
i
expect
london
will
change
then
there
came
across
the
room
monogue
sharp
voice
norah
norah
i
want
she
left
him
that
night
in
his
little
room
he
looked
from
his
window
at
the
sea
of
black
roofs
that
stretched
into
the
sky
and
found
in
their
ultimate
distance
the
wonderful
sweep
of
stars
that
domed
them
a
great
moon
dull
gold
staring
like
a
huge
eye
above
them
his
heart
was
full
a
god
there
must
be
somewhere
to
have
given
him
all
this
splendour
a
splendour
surely
for
him
to
work
upon
he
felt
as
a
craftsman
feels
when
some
new
and
wonderful
tools
have
been
given
to
him
as
a
woman
feels
the
child
in
her
womb
stirring
mysteriously
moving
her
to
deep
and
glad
thankfulness
so
now
with
the
night
wind
blowing
about
him
and
all
london
lying
dark
and
motionless
below
him
he
felt
the
first
stirring
of
his
power
this
was
his
to
work
with
this
was
his
to
praise
and
glorify
and
make
beautiful
now
crude
and
formless
a
seed
dark
and
without
form
or
colour
one
day
to
make
one
more
flower
in
that
garden
that
god
has
given
his
servants
to
work
in
he
did
not
at
this
instant
doubt
that
some
god
was
there
crying
to
him
and
that
he
must
answer
of
that
moon
of
those
stars
of
that
mighty
city
he
would
make
one
little
stone
that
might
be
added
to
that
eternal
temple
of
beauty
he
turned
from
his
window
and
thought
of
other
things
he
thought
of
his
father
and
scaw
house
of
the
windy
day
when
his
mother
was
buried
of
zanti
and
stephen
letter
of
herr
gottfried
and
his
blue
slippers
of
this
house
and
its
people
of
the
friendly
girl
and
her
grey
eyes
finally
for
a
little
of
himself
of
his
temper
and
his
ambitions
and
his
selfishness
here
indeed
suddenly
jumping
out
at
him
was
the
truth
he
felt
as
he
got
into
bed
that
he
would
have
to
change
a
great
deal
if
he
were
to
write
that
great
book
that
he
thought
of
little
peter
westcott
london
seemed
to
say
there
lots
to
be
done
to
you
first
before
you
worth
anything
i
batter
at
well
let
it
he
thought
sleepily
there
was
nothing
that
he
would
like
better
he
tumbled
into
sleep
with
london
after
him
and
fame
in
front
of
him
and
a
soft
and
resonant
murmur
as
of
a
slumbering
giant
rising
to
his
open
window
book
ii
the
bookshop
chapter
i
reuben
hallard
i
there
is
a
story
in
an
early
volume
of
henry
galleon
about
a
man
who
caught
as
he
may
have
caught
other
sicknesses
in
his
time
the
disease
of
the
terror
of
london
eating
his
breakfast
cheerfully
in
his
luxurious
chambers
in
mayfair
in
the
act
of
pouring
his
coffee
out
of
his
handsome
silver
he
paused
it
was
the
very
slightest
thing
that
held
his
attention
the
noise
of
the
rumbling
of
the
traffic
down
piccadilly
but
he
was
startled
and
on
that
morning
he
left
his
breakfast
unfinished
he
had
of
course
heard
that
rumbling
traffic
on
many
other
occasions
it
may
be
said
to
have
been
the
musical
accompaniment
to
his
breakfast
for
many
years
past
but
on
this
morning
it
was
different
as
one
has
a
headache
before
scarlet
fever
so
did
this
young
man
hear
the
rumble
of
the
traffic
down
piccadilly
he
listened
to
it
very
attentively
and
it
was
he
told
himself
very
like
the
noise
of
some
huge
animal
breathing
in
its
sleep
there
was
a
regularity
a
monotony
about
it
and
also
perhaps
a
sense
of
great
force
quiescent
now
and
held
in
restraint
he
was
a
very
normal
young
man
and
thoughts
of
this
kind
were
unlike
him
then
he
heard
other
things
the
trees
rustling
in
the
park
bells
ringing
on
every
side
of
him
builders
knocking
and
hammering
windows
rattling
doors
opening
and
shutting
in
the
club
one
evening
he
confided
in
a
friend
i
say
it
damned
funny
but
what
would
you
say
to
this
old
place
being
alive
taking
on
a
regular
existence
of
its
own
do
you
know
you
might
draw
it
a
great
beast
like
some
old
alligator
all
curled
up
with
its
teeth
and
things
making
a
noise
a
bit
as
it
moves
about
and
then
one
day
when
it
got
us
nicely
all
on
top
of
it
down
it
will
bring
us
all
houses
and
the
rest
damned
funny
idea
what
do
for
a
or
some
one
the
disease
developed
he
had
it
very
badly
but
at
first
his
friends
did
not
know
he
lay
awake
at
night
hearing
things
one
heard
much
more
at
night
sometimes
he
fancied
that
the
ground
shook
under
his
feet
but
most
terrible
of
all
was
it
when
there
was
perfect
silence
the
traffic
ceased
the
trees
and
windows
and
doors
were
still
the
creature
was
listening
sometimes
he
read
in
papers
that
buildings
had
suddenly
collapsed
he
smiled
to
himself
when
we
are
all
nicely
gathered
together
he
said
when
there
are
enough
people
then
his
friends
said
that
he
had
a
nervous
breakdown
they
sent
him
to
a
he
came
back
the
creature
was
fascinating
he
was
terrified
but
he
could
not
leave
it
he
knew
more
and
more
about
it
he
knew
now
what
it
was
like
and
he
saw
its
eyes
and
he
sometimes
could
picture
its
grey
scaly
back
with
churches
and
theatres
and
government
buildings
and
the
little
houses
of
smith
and
jones
perched
upon
it
and
the
noises
that
it
made
now
were
so
many
and
so
threatening
that
he
never
slept
at
all
then
he
began
to
run
shouting
down
piccadilly
so
they
put
him
very
reluctantly
into
a
nice
private
asylum
and
there
he
died
screaming
this
story
is
a
prologue
to
peter
life
in
london
the
story
struck
his
fancy
he
thought
of
it
sometimes
ii
on
a
late
stormy
afternoon
in
november
peter
finished
his
book
reuben
it
had
been
raining
all
day
and
now
the
windows
were
blurred
and
the
sea
of
shining
roofs
that
stretched
into
the
mist
emphasised
the
dark
and
gloom
of
the
heavy
overhanging
sky
peter
little
room
was
very
cold
but
his
body
was
burning
he
was
in
a
state
of
overpowering
excitement
his
hands
trembled
so
that
he
could
scarcely
hold
his
pen
so
died
reuben
hallard
a
fool
and
a
gentleman
and
then
finis
with
a
hard
straight
line
underneath
it
he
had
been
working
at
it
for
three
years
and
he
had
been
in
london
seven
he
walked
up
and
down
his
little
room
he
was
so
hot
that
he
flung
up
his
window
and
leaned
out
and
let
the
rain
that
was
coming
down
fiercely
now
lash
his
face
mud
london
was
full
of
mud
he
could
see
it
he
fancied
gathering
in
thick
brown
layers
upon
the
pavement
shining
and
glistening
as
it
mounted
slipping
in
streams
into
the
gutter
sweeping
about
the
foundations
of
the
houses
climbing
perhaps
one
day
to
the
very
windows
that
was
london
and
yet
he
loved
it
london
and
its
dirt
and
darkness
had
he
not
written
reuben
hallard
here
had
the
place
not
taken
him
into
its
arms
given
him
books
and
leisure
out
of
its
hospitality
treated
him
kindly
during
these
years
so
that
they
had
fled
like
an
instant
of
time
and
here
he
was
peter
westcott
aged
with
a
book
written
four
friends
made
and
the
best
health
possible
to
man
the
book
was
reuben
hallard
the
friends
were
brockett
zanti
herr
gottfried
and
norah
monogue
and
for
his
health
one
had
only
to
look
at
him
so
died
reuben
hallard
a
fool
and
a
gentleman
his
excitement
was
tremendous
his
cheeks
were
flaming
his
eyes
glittering
his
heart
beating
here
was
a
book
written
so
many
pages
covered
with
so
much
writing
his
claim
to
be
somebody
to
have
done
something
justified
and
most
wonderful
of
all
live
exciting
people
created
by
him
peter
westcott
he
did
not
think
now
of
publication
of
money
of
fame
only
after
sharing
for
three
years
in
the
trials
and
adventures
of
dear
beloved
souls
now
suddenly
he
emerged
cold
breathless
alone
into
the
world
again
exciting
why
furiously
of
course
he
could
have
sung
and
shouted
and
walked
right
over
the
tops
of
the
roofs
with
the
rain
beating
and
cooling
his
body
out
into
the
mist
of
the
horizon
book
reuben
hallard
london
was
swimming
in
thick
brown
mud
and
the
four
lamps
coming
out
in
bennett
square
in
a
dim
sickly
fashion
and
he
peter
westcott
had
written
a
book
the
signor
the
same
signor
some
seven
years
older
a
little
shabbier
but
nevertheless
the
same
signor
came
to
summon
him
to
supper
i
have
finished
it
what
the
book
yes
their
voices
were
awed
whispers
the
whole
house
had
during
the
last
three
years
shared
in
the
fortunes
of
the
book
peter
had
come
to
dinner
with
a
cloud
upon
his
brow
the
book
therefore
has
gone
badly
even
brockett
is
disturbed
and
lazarus
is
less
chirpy
than
usual
peter
comes
to
dinner
with
a
smile
the
book
therefore
has
gone
well
and
even
monogue
is
a
little
less
selfish
than
ordinary
the
signor
now
gazed
round
the
little
room
as
though
he
might
find
there
the
secret
of
so
great
an
achievement
on
peter
the
manuscript
was
piled
you
miss
it
the
signor
said
gloomily
you
miss
it
very
much
you
bound
to
you
have
to
get
it
typewritten
and
cost
never
mind
it
done
said
peter
shaking
his
head
as
a
dog
shakes
himself
when
he
leaves
the
water
there
they
are
those
people
and
now
i
going
to
he
stripped
to
the
waist
and
the
signor
watched
his
broad
back
and
strong
arms
with
a
sigh
for
his
own
feeble
proportions
he
wondered
how
it
was
that
being
in
a
stuffy
bookshop
for
seven
years
had
done
peter
no
harm
he
wondered
how
he
could
keep
the
back
of
his
neck
so
brown
as
that
in
london
and
his
cheeks
as
healthy
a
colour
and
his
eyes
as
clear
i
amazingly
unpleasant
to
look
at
the
signor
said
at
last
i
often
wonder
why
my
wife
married
me
i
not
surprised
that
every
one
finds
me
uninteresting
i
am
well
you
are
not
uninteresting
to
me
i
can
tell
you
said
peter
he
had
put
on
a
soft
white
shirt
a
black
tie
and
a
black
coat
and
trousers
the
last
of
these
a
little
shiny
perhaps
in
places
but
neat
and
well
brushed
and
you
would
really
not
guess
when
you
saw
him
that
he
only
possessed
two
suits
in
the
wide
world
think
you
absorbing
peter
said
a
little
patronisingly
perhaps
ah
that
proves
nothing
the
signer
retorted
you
only
care
for
fools
and
children
brockett
always
says
they
went
downstairs
peter
was
of
course
not
hungry
at
all
but
the
conventions
had
to
be
observed
in
the
round
about
the
green
settee
the
company
was
waiting
as
it
had
waited
seven
years
ago
there
were
one
or
two
unimportant
additions
and
monogue
had
died
the
year
before
and
lazarus
was
now
very
old
and
trembling
but
in
effect
there
was
very
little
change
he
has
finished
it
the
signor
announced
in
a
wondering
whisper
a
little
buzz
rose
filled
the
air
for
a
moment
and
then
sank
into
silence
again
lazarus
was
without
her
orange
because
she
had
to
wear
mittens
now
and
that
made
peeling
the
thing
difficult
i
sure
she
said
in
a
voice
like
that
of
a
very
excited
cricket
that
westcott
will
feel
better
after
he
had
something
to
eat
always
this
remark
left
conversation
at
a
standstill
the
rain
drove
against
the
panes
the
mud
rose
ever
higher
against
the
walls
and
dinner
was
announced
brockett
made
her
remarks
to
each
member
of
the
company
in
turn
as
usual
to
peter
she
said
i
hear
that
you
have
finished
your
book
westcott
we
shall
all
watch
eagerly
for
its
appearance
i
he
felt
his
excitement
slipping
away
from
him
as
the
moments
passed
suddenly
he
was
tired
instead
of
elation
there
was
wonder
doubt
what
if
after
all
the
book
should
be
very
bad
during
all
these
years
in
london
he
had
thought
of
it
during
all
these
years
he
had
known
that
it
was
going
to
succeed
what
if
now
he
should
discover
suddenly
that
it
was
bad
could
he
endure
it
the
people
of
his
book
seemed
now
to
stand
very
far
away
from
him
they
were
unreal
he
could
remember
scenes
things
that
they
had
said
and
done
absurd
ignorant
things
he
began
to
feel
panic
why
should
he
imagine
that
he
was
able
to
write
of
course
it
was
all
crude
worthless
stuff
he
looked
at
the
dingy
white
pillars
and
heavy
green
curtains
with
a
kind
of
despair
of
course
it
was
all
bad
he
had
been
hypnotised
by
the
thing
for
the
time
being
then
he
caught
norah
monogue
eyes
and
smiled
he
would
show
it
to
her
and
she
would
tell
him
what
it
was
worth
poor
tressiter
baby
had
died
last
week
and
now
suddenly
she
burst
out
crying
and
had
to
leave
the
room
there
was
a
little
twitter
of
sympathy
how
good
they
all
were
to
one
another
these
people
stupid
and
odd
perhaps
in
some
ways
but
so
brave
for
themselves
and
so
generous
to
one
another
it
was
no
mean
gathering
of
souls
that
brockett
dingy
gas
illuminated
every
now
and
again
the
heavy
curtains
blew
forward
in
the
wind
and
the
gas
flared
there
was
no
conversation
and
the
wind
could
be
heard
driving
the
rain
past
the
windows
iii
peter
that
evening
took
the
manuscript
of
reuben
hallard
into
miss
monogue
room
since
her
mother
died
norah
monogue
had
had
a
bed
to
herself
the
bed
was
hidden
by
a
high
screen
the
wall
paper
was
a
dark
green
and
low
bookshelves
painted
white
ran
round
the
room
there
were
no
pictures
she
always
said
that
until
she
could
have
good
ones
she
would
have
any
at
all
there
were
some
brown
pots
and
vases
on
the
shelves
and
a
with
a
typewriter
by
the
window
when
peter
came
in
norah
monogue
was
sitting
in
a
low
chair
over
a
rather
miserable
fire
a
little
pool
of
light
above
her
head
came
from
two
candles
on
the
mantelpiece
otherwise
the
room
was
in
darkness
shall
i
turn
on
the
gas
she
said
when
she
saw
who
it
was
no
leave
it
as
it
is
i
like
he
sat
down
in
a
chair
near
her
and
put
a
pile
of
manuscript
on
the
floor
beside
him
i
brought
it
for
you
to
read
he
said
i
frightened
about
it
i
suddenly
think
it
is
the
most
rotten
thing
that
ever
was
he
had
become
very
intimate
with
her
during
these
seven
years
at
first
he
had
admired
her
because
she
behaved
so
splendidly
to
her
abominable
mother
then
she
had
obviously
been
interested
in
him
had
talked
about
the
things
that
he
was
reading
and
his
life
at
the
bookshop
they
had
speedily
become
the
very
best
of
friends
and
she
understood
friendship
he
thought
in
the
right
way
as
though
she
had
herself
been
a
man
and
yet
she
was
with
that
completely
feminine
a
woman
who
had
known
struggle
from
the
beginning
and
would
know
it
to
the
end
but
her
personality
humorous
pathetic
understanding
was
felt
in
her
presence
so
strongly
that
no
one
ever
forgot
her
after
meeting
her
some
one
once
said
of
her
the
nicest
ugly
woman
to
look
at
i
ever
she
cared
immensely
about
her
appearance
she
saved
through
blood
and
tears
to
buy
clothes
and
then
always
bought
the
wrong
ones
she
had
perfect
taste
about
everything
except
herself
and
as
soon
as
it
touched
her
it
was
villainous
she
was
untidy
her
hair
streaked
already
with
grey
was
never
in
its
place
her
dress
was
generally
undone
at
the
back
her
gloves
had
holes
her
mother
death
had
left
her
some
fifty
pounds
a
year
and
she
earned
another
fifty
pounds
by
typewriting
untidy
in
everything
else
in
her
work
she
was
scrupulously
neat
she
had
had
a
story
taken
by
green
her
friends
belonged
as
indeed
just
at
this
time
so
many
people
belonged
to
the
cult
of
the
lily
repeated
the
witticisms
of
oscar
wilde
and
treasured
the
art
of
aubrey
beardsley
miss
monogue
believed
in
the
movement
and
rejected
the
affectations
in
when
the
reaction
began
she
defended
her
old
giants
but
looked
forward
eagerly
to
new
ones
she
worked
too
hard
to
have
very
many
friends
and
peter
saved
her
from
hours
of
loneliness
to
him
she
was
the
last
word
in
criticism
in
literature
he
would
have
liked
to
have
fashioned
reuben
hallard
after
the
manner
of
green
but
now
thought
sadly
that
it
was
as
unlike
that
manner
as
possible
that
is
why
he
was
afraid
to
bring
it
to
her
you
wo
like
it
he
said
i
thought
for
a
moment
i
had
done
something
fine
when
i
finished
it
this
afternoon
but
now
i
know
that
it
bad
it
all
rough
and
crude
it
terribly
that
all
right
she
answered
quietly
we
wo
say
any
more
about
it
until
i
have
read
it
then
we
they
were
silent
for
a
little
he
was
feeling
unhappy
and
curiously
enough
frightened
he
would
have
liked
to
jump
up
suddenly
and
shout
well
what
going
to
happen
now
not
only
to
norah
monogue
but
to
london
to
all
the
world
the
work
at
the
book
had
during
these
years
upheld
him
with
a
sense
of
purpose
and
aim
now
feeling
that
that
work
was
bad
his
aim
seemed
wasted
his
purpose
gone
here
were
seven
years
gone
and
he
had
done
nothing
seen
nothing
become
nothing
what
was
his
future
to
be
where
was
he
to
go
what
to
do
he
had
reasoned
blindly
to
himself
during
these
years
that
reuben
hallard
would
make
his
fortune
now
that
seemed
the
very
last
thing
it
would
do
i
knew
what
you
feeling
she
said
now
that
the
book
done
you
wondering
what
coming
it
more
than
that
i
been
in
london
seven
years
instead
of
writing
a
novel
that
no
one
will
want
to
read
i
might
have
been
getting
my
foot
in
i
might
at
any
rate
have
been
learning
london
finding
my
way
about
why
he
went
on
excitedly
do
you
know
that
except
for
a
walk
or
two
and
going
into
the
gallery
at
covent
garden
once
or
twice
and
the
proms
sometimes
and
meeting
some
people
at
herr
gottfried
once
or
twice
i
spent
the
whole
of
my
seven
years
between
here
and
the
bookshop
you
must
worry
about
that
it
was
quite
the
right
thing
to
do
you
must
remember
that
there
are
two
ways
of
learning
things
first
through
all
that
every
one
has
written
then
through
all
that
every
one
is
doing
up
to
now
you
been
studying
the
first
of
those
two
now
ready
to
take
part
in
all
the
and
you
will
london
will
fling
you
into
it
as
soon
as
you
ready
you
can
be
i
been
awfully
happy
all
this
time
he
went
on
reflectively
too
happy
i
expect
i
never
thought
about
anything
except
reading
and
writing
the
book
and
talking
to
you
and
gottfried
now
things
will
begin
i
what
kind
of
things
oh
well
it
is
likely
that
i
going
to
be
let
alone
for
ever
never
told
you
have
i
about
my
life
before
i
came
up
to
london
she
hesitated
a
little
before
she
answered
no
you
never
told
me
anything
i
could
see
of
course
that
it
had
been
how
could
you
see
that
well
it
had
been
easy
for
either
of
us
that
made
us
friends
and
then
you
do
look
like
a
person
who
would
take
things
easily
ever
tell
me
about
your
early
life
before
you
came
here
norah
monogue
said
she
watched
his
face
as
he
told
her
she
had
found
him
exceedingly
good
company
during
the
seven
years
that
she
had
known
him
they
had
slipped
into
their
friendship
so
easily
and
so
naturally
that
she
had
never
taken
herself
to
task
about
it
in
any
way
it
existed
as
a
very
delightful
accompaniment
to
the
day
worries
and
disappointments
she
suddenly
realised
now
with
a
little
surprised
shock
how
bitterly
she
would
miss
it
all
were
it
to
cease
in
the
darkened
room
with
the
storm
blowing
outside
she
felt
her
loneliness
with
an
acute
wave
of
emotion
and
that
was
very
unlike
her
if
peter
were
to
go
she
felt
she
could
scarcely
endure
to
live
on
in
the
dreary
building
part
of
his
charm
from
the
beginning
had
been
that
he
was
so
astoundingly
young
part
of
his
interest
that
he
could
be
at
times
so
amazingly
old
she
felt
that
she
herself
could
be
equal
neither
to
his
youth
nor
his
age
she
was
herself
so
ordinary
a
person
but
watching
him
made
the
most
fascinating
occupation
and
speculating
over
his
future
made
the
most
wonderful
dreams
that
he
was
a
personality
that
he
might
do
anything
she
had
always
believed
but
there
had
until
now
been
no
proof
of
it
in
any
work
that
he
had
done
he
had
had
nothing
to
show
now
at
last
there
lay
there
with
her
in
the
room
the
evidence
of
her
belief
his
book
but
the
book
seemed
now
at
this
moment
of
small
account
and
as
she
watched
him
with
the
and
the
last
flicker
of
the
upon
his
face
she
saw
that
he
had
forgotten
her
and
was
back
again
soul
and
spirit
amongst
the
things
of
which
he
was
speaking
his
voice
was
low
and
monotonous
his
eyes
staring
straight
in
front
of
him
his
hands
spread
on
his
knees
gripped
the
cloth
of
his
trousers
she
would
not
admit
to
herself
that
she
was
frightened
but
her
heart
was
beating
very
fast
and
it
was
as
though
some
stranger
were
with
her
in
the
room
it
may
have
been
the
effect
of
the
candlelight
blowing
now
in
the
wind
that
came
through
the
cracks
in
the
window
panes
but
it
seemed
to
her
that
peter
face
was
changed
his
face
had
lines
that
had
not
been
there
before
his
mouth
was
thinner
and
harder
and
his
eyes
were
old
and
tired
she
had
never
seen
the
man
before
that
was
her
impression
but
she
had
never
known
anything
so
vivid
quietly
as
though
he
were
reciting
the
story
to
himself
and
were
not
sure
whether
he
were
telling
it
aloud
or
no
he
began
as
he
continued
she
could
see
the
place
as
though
it
was
there
with
her
in
the
room
the
little
inn
that
ran
out
into
the
water
the
street
the
sea
road
the
grim
stone
house
standing
back
amongst
its
belt
of
trees
the
grey
hill
the
coast
the
fields
and
then
the
story
the
night
of
the
fight
the
beating
the
that
day
with
his
mother
here
he
gave
her
actual
dialogue
as
though
there
was
no
word
of
it
that
he
had
forgotten
the
funeral
and
then
at
last
gradually
climbing
to
its
climax
breathlessly
the
relation
of
father
and
son
its
hatred
then
its
degradation
and
last
of
all
that
ludicrous
scene
in
the
early
morning
he
told
her
everything
when
he
had
finished
there
was
a
long
silence
between
them
the
fire
was
out
and
the
room
very
cold
the
storm
had
fallen
now
in
a
fury
about
the
house
and
the
rain
lashed
the
windows
and
then
fell
in
gurgling
stuttering
torrents
through
the
pipes
and
along
the
leads
miss
monogue
could
not
move
the
scene
the
place
the
incidents
were
slowly
fading
away
and
the
room
slowly
coming
back
again
the
face
opposite
her
also
gradually
seemed
to
drop
as
though
it
had
been
a
mask
the
expression
that
it
had
worn
peter
westcott
the
peter
that
she
knew
sat
before
her
again
she
could
have
believed
as
she
looked
at
him
that
the
impressions
of
the
last
had
been
entirely
false
and
yet
the
things
that
he
had
told
her
were
not
altogether
a
surprise
she
had
not
known
him
for
seven
years
without
seeing
signs
of
some
other
temper
and
spirit
controlled
indeed
but
nevertheless
there
and
very
different
from
the
pleasant
happy
peter
who
played
with
the
tressiter
children
and
dared
to
chaff
brockett
you
paid
me
a
great
compliment
telling
me
this
she
said
at
last
remember
we
friends
you
proved
that
we
are
by
coming
like
this
i
sha
forget
it
at
any
rate
she
added
softly
it
all
right
now
peter
it
all
over
over
no
indeed
he
answered
her
do
you
suppose
that
one
can
grow
up
like
that
and
then
shake
it
off
sometimes
i
think
i
afraid
he
stopped
abruptly
biting
his
lips
oh
well
he
went
on
suddenly
in
a
brighter
tone
there
no
need
to
bother
you
with
all
that
it
nothing
i
a
bit
done
up
over
this
book
i
expect
but
that
really
why
i
told
you
that
little
piece
of
autobiography
because
it
will
help
you
to
understand
the
book
the
book
come
out
of
all
that
and
you
might
have
believed
that
it
was
me
at
all
unless
told
you
these
he
stood
facing
her
and
a
sudden
awkwardness
came
over
both
of
them
the
fire
was
dead
save
for
one
red
coal
and
the
windows
rattled
like
he
was
feeling
perhaps
that
he
had
told
her
too
much
and
the
reserve
of
his
age
the
fear
of
being
indiscreet
had
come
upon
him
and
with
her
there
was
the
difficulty
of
not
knowing
exactly
what
comfort
it
was
that
he
wanted
or
whether
indeed
any
kind
of
comfort
would
not
be
an
insult
to
him
and
with
all
that
awkwardness
there
was
also
a
knowledge
that
they
had
never
been
so
near
together
before
an
intimacy
had
been
established
that
night
that
would
never
again
be
broken
into
their
silence
there
came
a
knock
on
the
door
when
miss
monogue
opened
it
the
stern
figure
of
brockett
confronted
her
i
beg
your
pardon
miss
monogue
but
is
westcott
here
peter
stepped
forward
oh
i
sure
i
sorry
to
have
to
disturb
you
westcott
but
there
a
man
outside
on
the
steps
who
insists
on
seeing
seeing
me
yes
he
wo
come
in
or
go
away
he
wo
move
until
he
seen
you
very
obstinate
i
sure
and
such
a
night
rather
late
too
brockett
was
obviously
displeased
her
tall
black
figure
was
drawn
up
outside
the
door
as
a
sentry
might
guard
buckingham
palace
there
was
a
confusion
of
regality
displeasure
and
grim
humour
in
her
attitude
but
peter
was
a
favourite
of
hers
with
a
hurried
goodnight
to
miss
monogue
he
left
the
two
women
standing
on
the
stairs
and
went
to
the
when
he
opened
it
the
wind
was
blowing
up
the
steps
so
furiously
that
it
flung
him
back
into
the
hall
again
outside
in
the
square
the
world
was
a
wild
tempestuous
black
only
a
little
to
the
right
the
feeble
glow
of
the
lamp
blew
hither
and
thither
in
the
wind
the
rain
had
stopped
but
all
the
pipes
and
funnels
of
the
city
were
roaring
with
water
the
noise
was
that
of
a
thousand
chattering
voices
and
very
faintly
through
the
tumult
the
bells
of
matthews
in
euston
square
tinkled
the
hour
on
the
steps
a
figure
was
standing
bending
beneath
the
wind
the
light
from
the
hall
shone
out
on
to
the
black
slabs
of
stone
bright
with
the
shining
rain
but
his
cape
covered
the
man
head
nevertheless
peter
knew
at
once
who
it
was
stephen
he
said
quietly
the
hall
door
was
flung
to
with
a
crash
the
wind
hurled
peter
against
stephen
body
at
last
oh
stephen
why
did
you
come
before
i
could
master
peter
i
ought
to
of
come
now
but
i
to
see
yer
face
a
minute
not
more
than
a
minute
though
but
you
must
come
in
now
and
get
dry
things
on
at
once
i
see
brockett

a
room
i
not
going
to
let
you
go
now
that
no
master
peter

so
far
away
all
this
time
as

might
have
thought
but
i
must
see
yer
unless
i
can
be
of
use
to
yer
and
that
what
i
come
he
pressed
close
up
to
peter
held
both
his
hands
in
his
and
said
look
peter
boy
yer
may
be
wanting
me
soon
no
i
ca
say
more
than
that
but
i
want
yer

be
meeting
soon
enough
only
i
there
boy
if
yer
wants
me
and
keep
yer
eye
open
in
an
instant
that
warm
pressure
of
the
hand
was
gone
the
darker
black
of
stephen
body
no
longer
silhouetted
against
the
lighter
black
of
the
night
sky
still
in
peter
nose
there
was
that
scent
of
wet
clothes
and
the
deep
husky
voice
was
in
his
ears
but
save
for
the
faint
yellow
flickering
lamp
struggling
against
the
tempest
he
was
alone
in
the
square
the
rain
had
begun
to
fall
again
chapter
ii
the
man
on
the
lion
i
after
the
storm
the
fog
it
came
a
yellow
shrouded
witch
down
upon
the
town
clinging
choking
writhing
and
bringing
in
its
train
a
thousand
mysteries
a
thousand
visions
it
was
many
years
since
so
dense
and
cruel
a
fog
had
startled
london
in
his
seven
years
experience
of
the
place
peter
had
known
nothing
like
it
and
his
mind
flew
back
to
that
afternoon
of
his
arrival
seven
years
before
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
now
moving
straight
on
from
that
point
and
that
there
had
been
no
intervening
period
at
all
the
signer
saw
in
a
fog
as
a
cat
sees
in
the
dark
and
he
led
peter
to
the
bookshop
without
hesitation
he
saw
a
good
many
other
things
beside
his
immediate
direction
and
became
comparatively
cheerful
and
happy
it
is
such
a
good
thing
that
people
ca
see
me
he
said
it
relieves
one
of
a
lot
of
responsibility
if
one
plain
to
look
at
one
can
act
more
certainly
the
signor
acted
with
very
considerable
freedom
darting
off
suddenly
into
the
fog
apparently
with
the
intention
of
speaking
to
some
one
and
leaving
peter
perfectly
helpless
and
then
suddenly
darting
back
again
catching
peter
in
tow
and
tugging
him
forward
once
more
to
the
bookshop
itself
the
fog
made
very
little
difference
there
were
always
the
burning
over
the
two
dark
corners
and
the
top
shelves
even
in
the
brightest
of
weather
were
mistily
shrouded
by
dust
and
distance
the
fog
indeed
seemed
to
bring
the
books
out
and
whilst
the
world
outside
was
so
dark
the
little
shop
flickered
away
under
the
with
little
spasmodic
leaps
into
light
and
colour
when
the
door
opened
and
blew
the
quivering
flame
it
was
not
of
the
books
that
peter
was
thinking
this
morning
he
sat
at
a
little
desk
in
one
dark
corner
under
one
of
the
and
herr
gottfried
huddled
up
as
usual
with
his
hair
sticking
out
above
the
desk
like
a
mop
sat
under
the
other
an
old
brass
clock
perched
on
a
heap
of
books
ticked
away
the
minutes
otherwise
there
was
silence
save
when
a
customer
entered
bringing
with
him
a
trail
of
fog
or
some
one
who
was
not
a
customer
passed
solemnly
seriously
through
to
the
rooms
beyond
the
shop
was
of
course
full
of
fog
and
the
books
seemed
to
form
into
lines
and
rows
and
curves
in
and
out
amongst
the
shelves
of
their
own
accord
peter
meanwhile
was
most
intently
thinking
he
knew
as
though
he
had
seen
it
written
down
in
large
black
letters
in
front
of
him
that
a
period
was
shortly
to
be
put
to
his
present
occupation
but
he
could
not
have
said
how
it
was
that
he
knew
the
finishing
of
his
book
left
the
way
clear
for
a
number
of
things
to
attack
his
mind
here
in
this
misty
shop
he
was
beset
with
questions
why
was
he
here
at
all
had
he
during
these
seven
years
been
of
such
value
that
the
shop
could
not
get
on
without
him
to
that
second
question
he
must
certainly
answer
no
why
then
had
zanti
kept
him
all
this
time
surely
because
zanti
was
fond
of
him
yes
that
undoubtedly
was
a
part
of
the
reason
the
relationship
all
this
time
had
grown
very
strong
and
it
was
only
now
when
he
set
himself
seriously
to
think
about
it
that
he
realised
how
glad
he
always
was
when
zanti
returned
from
his
travels
and
how
happy
he
had
been
when
it
had
been
possible
for
them
to
spend
an
afternoon
together
yes
zanti
was
attached
to
him
he
had
often
said
that
he
looked
upon
him
as
a
son
and
sometimes
it
seemed
to
peter
that
the
strange
man
was
about
to
make
some
declaration
something
that
would
clear
the
air
and
explain
the
world
but
he
never
did
peter
had
discovered
strangely
little
about
him
he
knew
now
that
zanti
connection
with
the
bookshop
was
of
the
very
slenderest
that
that
was
indeed
entirely
herr
gottfried
affair
and
that
it
was
used
by
the
large
and
smiling
gentleman
as
a
cloak
and
a
covering
as
a
cloak
and
a
covering
to
what
well
at
any
rate
to
some
large
and
complicated
game
that
a
great
number
of
gentlemen
were
engaged
in
playing
peter
knew
a
good
many
of
them
now
by
sight
untidy
dirty
many
foreigners
most
all
it
seemed
to
peter
with
an
air
of
attempting
something
that
they
could
never
hope
to
accomplish
anything
that
they
might
do
he
was
quite
sure
that
they
would
bungle
and
with
the
hearts
of
children
the
dirty
tatters
of
foreign
countries
and
the
imaginations
of
exuberant
he
could
see
them
go
ignorantly
to
dreadful
catastrophes
peter
was
even
conscious
that
the
shop
was
tolerantly
watched
by
inspectors
detectives
and
policemen
and
that
it
was
all
too
childish
whatever
it
was
for
any
one
to
take
it
in
the
least
seriously
but
nevertheless
there
were
elements
of
very
real
danger
in
all
those
blundering
mysteries
that
had
been
going
on
now
for
so
many
years
and
it
was
at
any
rate
of
the
greatest
importance
to
peter
because
he
earned
his
living
by
it
because
of
his
love
for
stephen
and
his
affection
for
zanti
and
because
if
once
anything
were
to
happen
his
one
in
this
wild
sea
of
london
would
be
swept
away
and
he
would
be
utterly
resourceless
and
destitute
this
last
fact
bit
him
as
he
sat
there
in
the
shop
with
sudden
and
acute
sharpness
what
a
fool
he
had
been
all
this
time
to
let
things
slide
he
should
have
been
making
connections
having
irons
in
the
fire
bustling
about
how
could
he
have
sat
down
thus
happily
and
easily
for
seven
years
as
though
such
a
condition
of
things
could
continue
for
ever
he
had
had
wild
ideas
of
reuben
hallard
making
his
fortune
that
showed
his
ignorance
of
the
world
let
him
begin
to
bustle
he
would
not
lose
another
moment
there
were
two
things
for
him
now
to
do
to
beard
editors
those
mythical
creatures
in
their
caves
and
to
find
out
where
stephen
lived
both
these
things
as
soon
as
possible
in
the
afternoon
the
fog
became
of
an
impenetrable
thickness
and
beyond
the
shop
it
seemed
that
there
was
pandemonium
some
fire
blazing
at
some
street
corner
flared
as
though
it
were
the
beating
heart
of
all
that
darkness
and
the
cries
of
men
and
the
slow
clumsy
passing
of
the
traffic
filled
the
bookshop
with
sound
no
customers
came
herr
gottfried
worked
away
at
his
desk
the
brass
clock
ticked
peter
sat
listening
waiting
herr
gottfried
broke
the
silence
once
with
peter
my
friend
at
ten
there
will
be
a
little
music
in
my
room
herr
dettzolter
and
his
a
little
brahms
if
the
fog
is
not
too
much
for
peter
accepted
he
loved
the
attic
the
clouds
of
tobacco
the
dark
corner
where
he
sat
and
listened
to
herr
gottfried
friends
german
exiles
like
herr
gottfried
playing
their
beloved
music
it
was
his
only
luxury
once
two
men
whom
peter
knew
very
well
by
sight
came
into
the
shop
they
were
he
believed
russians
one
of
them
was
called
oblotzky
a
tall
bearded
creature
who
could
speak
no
english
then
suddenly
just
as
peter
was
thinking
of
finding
his
way
home
to
the
zanti
appeared
he
had
been
away
for
the
last
two
months
but
there
he
was
his
huge
body
filling
the
shop
the
fog
circling
his
beard
like
a
halo
beaming
calm
and
unflustered
as
though
he
had
just
come
from
the
next
street
damned
fog
he
said
and
then
he
went
and
put
his
hand
on
shoulder
and
looked
down
at
him
smiling
well
goes
the
shop
he
said
oh
well
enough
said
peter
what
you
been
doing
boy
finished
the
book
ah
good
you
be
ze
great
man
he
looked
down
at
him
proudly
as
a
father
might
look
upon
his
son
ze
damnedest
fog
he
began
then
suddenly
he
stopped
and
peter
felt
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
tighten
ze
damnedest
zanti
said
slowly
peter
looked
up
into
his
face
he
was
listening
herr
gottfried
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
shop
was
also
listening
for
a
moment
there
was
an
intense
breathless
silence
the
noise
from
the
street
seemed
also
for
the
instant
to
be
hushed
very
slowly
very
quietly
zanti
went
to
the
street
door
and
opened
it
a
cloud
of
yellow
fog
blew
into
the
shop
ze
damnedest
fog
repeated
zanti
still
very
slowly
as
though
he
were
thinking
any
one
been
he
said
at
last
to
herr
gottfried
zanti
after
flinging
a
strange
look
at
peter
went
through
into
the
room
beyond
what
said
peter
often
enough
interrupted
herr
gottfried
shuffling
back
to
his
seat
young
boys
want
to
know
too
much
often
ii
the
tressiter
children
of
whom
there
were
eight
loved
peter
with
a
devotion
that
was
in
fact
idolatry
they
loved
him
because
he
understood
them
so
completely
and
from
anne
susan
aged
one
and
a
half
to
rupert
bernard
aged
nine
there
was
no
member
of
the
family
who
did
not
repose
complete
trust
and
confidence
in
peter
opinions
and
rejoice
in
his
wonderful
grasp
of
the
things
in
the
world
that
really
mattered
other
persons
might
be
seen
shifting
slowly
and
laboriously
their
estimates
and
standards
in
order
to
bring
them
into
line
with
the
youthful
tressiter
estimates
and
standards
peter
had
his
ready
without
any
shifting
first
of
all
the
family
did
robin
tressiter
aged
four
adore
peter
he
was
a
fat
round
child
with
brown
eyes
and
brown
hair
and
an
immense
and
overwhelming
interest
in
the
world
and
everything
contained
therein
he
was
a
silent
child
with
a
delightful
fat
chuckle
when
really
amused
and
pleased
and
he
never
cried
his
interest
in
the
world
led
him
into
strange
and
terrible
catastrophes
and
tressiter
was
always
far
too
busy
and
too
helpless
to
be
of
any
real
assistance
on
this
foggy
afternoon
peter
arriving
at
brockett
after
much
difficulty
and
hesitation
found
robin
tressiter
on
miss
monogue
landing
with
his
head
fastened
between
the
railings
that
overlooked
the
hall
below
he
was
stuck
very
fast
indeed
but
appeared
to
be
perfectly
unperturbed
only
every
now
and
again
he
kicked
a
little
with
his
legs
i
sticked
my
neck
in
these
silly
things
he
said
when
he
saw
peter
you
must
pull
at
peter
tried
to
wriggle
the
child
through
but
he
found
that
he
must
have
some
one
to
help
him
urging
robin
not
to
move
he
knocked
at
miss
monogue
door
she
opened
it
and
he
stepped
back
with
an
apology
when
he
saw
that
some
one
else
was
there
it
a
friend
of
mine
norah
monogue
said
come
in
and
be
introduced
it
only
peter
explained
that
young
robin
has
got
his
head
stuck
in
the
banisters
and
i
want
some
one
to
help
me
between
them
they
pulled
the
boy
through
to
safety
he
chuckled
i
do
it
again
he
said
i
rather
you
did
said
peter
then
i
wo
said
robin
i
did
it
rupert
said
i
could
rupert
silly
you
must
call
your
brother
names
or
i
wo
come
and
see
you
in
you
will
come
said
robin
very
earnestly
i
will
said
peter
if
you
do
call
your
brother
i
think
said
robin
reflectively
that
now
i
will
hunt
for
the
lion
and
the
tigers
on
the
stairs
bring
him
into
my
room
until
his
bedtime
said
miss
monogue
laughing
it
safer
tressiter
is
busy
and
has
quite
enough
children
in
with
her
so
peter
brought
robin
into
miss
norah
monogue
room
and
was
introduced
at
once
to
clare
elizabeth
rossiter
so
easily
and
simply
do
the
furious
events
of
life
occur
she
was
standing
with
her
back
to
the
window
and
the
light
from
miss
monogue
candles
fell
on
her
black
dress
and
her
hair
as
he
came
towards
her
he
knew
at
once
that
she
was
the
little
girl
who
had
talked
to
him
on
a
one
good
friday
afternoon
he
could
almost
hear
her
now
as
she
spoke
to
crumpet
the
glow
was
dim
and
sacred
in
the
foggy
room
the
colour
of
her
hair
was
filled
more
wonderfully
with
light
and
fire
her
hands
were
so
delicate
and
fine
as
they
moved
against
her
black
dress
that
they
seemed
to
have
some
harmony
of
their
own
like
a
piece
of
music
or
a
running
stream
she
wore
blue
feathers
in
her
black
hat
she
did
not
know
him
at
all
when
he
came
forward
but
she
smiled
down
at
robin
who
was
clinging
on
to
trousers
this
is
a
friend
of
mine
westcott
miss
monogue
said
she
turned
gravely
and
met
him
they
shook
hands
and
then
she
sat
down
suddenly
she
bent
down
and
took
robin
into
her
lap
he
sat
there
sucking
his
thumb
and
taking
every
now
and
again
a
sudden
look
at
her
hair
and
the
light
that
the
candles
made
on
it
but
he
was
very
silent
and
quiet
which
was
unlike
him
because
he
generally
hated
strangers
peter
sat
down
and
was
filled
with
embarrassment
his
heart
also
was
beating
very
quickly
i
have
met
you
before
he
said
suddenly
you
do
no
i
afraid
you
had
once
a
great
many
years
ago
a
dog
called
crumpet
once
in
cornwall
one
good
friday
he
tumbled
into
a
a
boy
why
of
course
she
broke
in
i
remember
you
perfectly
why
of
all
the
things
norah
do
you
realise
your
friend
and
i
have
known
each
other
for
eight
years
is
the
world
a
small
place
why
i
remember
perfectly
now
she
turned
and
talked
to
norah
monogue
and
whilst
she
talked
he
took
her
in
although
now
she
was
grown
up
she
was
still
strangely
like
that
little
girl
in
cornwall
he
realised
that
now
as
he
looked
at
her
he
had
still
something
of
the
same
feeling
about
her
as
he
had
had
then
that
she
was
some
one
to
be
cared
for
protected
something
fragile
that
the
world
might
break
if
she
were
not
guarded
she
was
porcelain
but
without
anything
of
meredith
because
peter
was
strong
and
burly
the
contrast
of
her
appealing
fragility
attracted
him
all
the
more
had
she
not
been
so
perfectly
proportioned
her
size
would
have
been
a
defect
but
now
it
was
simple
that
her
delicacy
of
colour
and
feature
demanded
that
slightness
and
slenderness
of
build
her
hair
was
of
so
burning
a
that
its
colour
gave
her
precisely
the
setting
that
she
required
she
seemed
as
she
sat
there
a
little
helpless
and
peter
fancied
that
she
was
wishing
him
to
understand
that
she
wanted
friends
who
should
assist
her
in
rather
a
world
just
as
she
had
once
appealed
to
him
to
save
crumpet
so
now
she
seemed
to
appeal
for
some
far
greater
assistance
ah
how
he
could
protect
her
peter
thought
something
in
peter
steady
gaze
seemed
suddenly
to
surprise
her
she
stopped
the
colour
mounted
into
her
cheeks
she
bent
down
over
the
boy
they
were
both
of
them
supremely
conscious
of
one
another
there
was
a
moment
then
as
men
feel
when
some
music
that
has
held
them
ceases
they
came
with
a
sense
of
breathlessness
back
to
norah
monogue
and
her
dim
room
peter
was
conscious
that
robin
had
watched
them
both
he
almost
peter
thought
chuckled
to
himself
in
his
fat
solemn
way
miss
rossiter
norah
monogue
said
and
her
voice
seemed
a
long
way
away
has
just
come
back
from
germany
and
has
brought
some
wonderful
photographs
with
her
she
was
going
to
show
them
to
me
when
you
came
in
let
me
see
them
too
please
said
peter
robin
was
put
on
to
the
floor
and
he
went
slowly
and
with
ceremony
to
an
old
brown
china
toby
that
had
his
place
on
a
little
shelf
by
the
door
this
toby
his
name
was
nathaniel
was
an
old
friend
of
robin
robin
sat
on
the
floor
in
a
corner
and
told
nathaniel
the
things
about
the
world
that
he
had
noticed
every
now
and
again
he
paused
for
reply
he
was
always
waiting
for
him
to
speak
and
the
continued
silence
of
a
now
ancient
acquaintance
had
not
shaken
robin
faith
robin
forgot
the
rest
of
the
company
photographs
said
peter
yes
germany
i
have
just
been
she
looked
up
at
him
eagerly
and
then
opened
a
portfolio
that
she
had
behind
her
chair
and
began
to
show
them
he
bent
gravely
forward
feeling
that
all
of
this
was
pretence
of
the
most
absurd
kind
and
that
she
also
knew
that
it
was
but
they
were
very
beautiful
photographs
the
most
beautiful
that
he
had
ever
seen
and
as
each
in
its
turn
was
shown
for
a
moment
his
eyes
met
hers
and
his
mouth
almost
against
his
will
smiled
his
hand
too
was
very
near
the
silk
of
her
dress
if
he
moved
it
a
very
little
more
then
they
would
touch
he
felt
that
if
that
happened
the
room
would
immediately
burst
into
flame
the
air
was
so
charged
with
the
breathless
tension
but
he
watched
the
little
space
of
air
between
his
fingers
and
the
black
silk
and
his
hand
did
not
move
they
were
all
very
silent
as
she
turned
the
photographs
over
and
there
were
no
sounds
but
the
sharp
crackling
of
the
fire
as
it
burst
into
little
spurts
of
flame
the
noise
that
her
hand
made
on
the
silk
of
her
dress
as
she
turned
each
picture
and
the
little
mutterings
of
robin
in
his
corner
as
he
talked
to
his
toby
peter
had
never
seen
anything
like
this
photography
the
man
had
used
his
medium
as
delicately
as
though
he
had
drawn
every
line
things
stood
out
castles
a
hill
trees
running
water
a
shining
road
and
behind
them
there
was
darkness
and
mystery
suddenly
peter
cried
out
oh
that
he
said
it
was
the
photograph
of
a
great
statue
standing
on
a
hill
that
overlooked
a
river
that
was
all
that
could
be
seen
the
background
was
dark
and
vague
it
was
the
statue
of
a
man
who
rode
a
lion
the
lion
was
of
enormous
size
and
struggling
to
be
free
but
the
man
naked
with
his
utmost
energy
his
back
set
his
arms
stiff
had
it
in
control
but
only
just
in
control
his
face
was
terrible
in
the
agony
of
his
struggle
and
that
struggle
had
lasted
for
a
great
period
of
time
but
at
length
when
all
but
defeated
he
had
mastered
his
beast
ah
that
miss
rossiter
held
it
up
that
norah
monogue
might
see
it
better
that
is
on
a
hill
outside
a
little
town
in
bavaria
they
put
it
up
to
a
herr
drexter
who
had
done
something
saved
their
town
from
riot
i
think
it
a
fine
thing
is
it
and
i
think
it
so
clever
of
them
to
have
made
him
with
all
the
marks
of
the
struggle
about
him
those
scars
his
face
so
that
you
can
see
that
it
all
been
tremendous
peter
spoke
very
slowly
i
give
anything
to
see
that
he
said
well
it
in
bavaria
i
wonder
that
it
is
better
known
but
funnily
enough
the
people
that
were
with
me
at
the
time
did
like
it
it
was
only
afterwards
when
i
showed
them
the
photograph
that
they
saw
that
there
might
have
been
are
people
funny
she
ended
abruptly
appealing
to
him
with
a
kind
of
freemasonry
against
the
world
but
still
bending
his
brows
upon
it
he
said
insistently
tell
me
more
about
it
the
place
everything
there
is
really
anything
to
tell
it
only
a
very
ordinary
very
beautiful
little
german
town
there
are
many
orchards
and
this
forest
at
the
back
of
it
and
the
river
running
through
it
little
cobbled
streets
and
bridges
over
the
river
and
then
outside
this
great
statue
on
the
hill
ah
but
it
wonderful
that
man
face
i
like
to
go
to
that
town
he
felt
perhaps
that
he
was
taking
it
all
too
seriously
for
he
turned
round
and
said
laughing
the
boy
daft
on
lions
robin
come
and
look
at
this
lion
here
an
animal
for
the
boy
put
down
the
toby
and
walked
slowly
and
solemnly
toward
them
he
climbed
on
to
peter
knee
and
looked
at
the
photograph
oh
it
a
lion
he
said
at
last
rubbing
his
fat
finger
on
the
surface
of
it
to
see
of
what
material
it
was
made
oh
for
me
he
said
at
last
in
a
shrill
excited
voice
and
clutching
on
to
it
with
one
hand
for
me
to
hang
over
my
no
old
man
peter
answered
it
belongs
to
the
lady
here
she
must
take
it
away
with
oh
but
want
it
his
eyes
began
to
fill
with
tears
miss
rossiter
bent
down
and
kissed
him
he
looked
at
her
distrustfully
i
know
now
i
not
to
have
it
he
said
at
last
eyeing
her
or
you
would
have
kissed
come
on
said
peter
afraid
of
a
scene
the
lady
will
show
you
the
lion
another
day
meantime
i
think
bed
is
the
he
mounted
the
boy
on
to
his
shoulder
and
turned
round
to
miss
rossiter
to
say
the
photograph
lay
on
the
table
between
them
i
sha
forget
that
he
said
oh
but
you
must
come
and
see
us
one
day
my
mother
will
be
delighted
there
are
a
lot
more
photographs
at
home
you
must
bring
him
out
one
day
norah
she
said
turning
to
miss
monogue
if
he
had
been
a
primitive
member
of
society
in
the
stone
age
he
would
at
this
point
have
placed
robin
carefully
on
the
floor
and
have
picked
miss
rossiter
up
and
she
should
never
again
have
left
his
care
as
it
was
he
said
i
shall
be
delighted
to
come
one
we
will
talk
about
cornwall
and
his
hand
was
burning
hot
when
he
gave
it
her
he
knew
that
she
was
looking
at
his
eyes
he
was
abruptly
conscious
of
miss
monogue
voice
behind
him
i
read
a
quarter
of
the
book
he
wondered
as
he
turned
to
her
how
it
could
be
possible
to
regard
two
women
so
differently
to
be
so
sternly
critical
of
one
her
hair
that
was
nearly
down
a
little
ink
on
her
thumb
her
blouse
that
was
unbuttoned
and
of
the
other
to
see
her
all
in
a
glory
so
that
her
whole
body
for
colour
and
light
and
beautiful
silence
had
no
equal
amongst
the
possessions
of
the
earth
or
the
wonders
of
heaven
here
there
was
a
button
undone
there
there
was
a
flaming
fire
i
wo
say
anything
miss
monogue
said
until
i
read
more
but
it
going
to
be
extraordinarily
good
i
what
did
he
care
about
reuben
hallard
what
did
that
matter
when
he
had
claire
elizabeth
rossiter
in
front
of
him
and
then
he
pulled
himself
up
it
must
matter
how
delighted
an
hour
ago
those
words
would
have
made
him
oh
you
think
there
something
in
it
he
said
we
wait
she
answered
but
her
smile
and
the
sparkle
in
her
eyes
showed
what
she
thought
what
a
brick
she
was
he
turned
round
back
to
miss
rossiter
my
first
book
he
said
laughing
of
course
we
excited
and
then
he
was
out
of
the
room
in
a
moment
with
robin
clutching
his
hair
he
did
not
want
to
look
at
her
again
he
had
so
wonderful
a
picture
and
as
he
left
robin
in
the
heart
of
his
family
he
heard
him
say
a
lion
mother
a
lady
got
with
a
man
on
it
a
lion
and
the
man
has
any
clothes
on
and
his
legs
are
all
scratched
chapter
iii
royal
personages
are
coming
i
peter
sitting
obscurely
in
a
corner
of
herr
gottfried
attic
on
the
evening
of
this
eventful
day
and
listening
to
that
string
sextette
that
was
written
by
brahms
when
he
was
nineteen
years
of
age
and
it
came
straight
from
the
heights
of
olympus
if
any
piece
of
music
ever
did
was
conscious
of
the
eyes
of
herr
lutz
herr
lutz
was
herr
gottfried
greatest
friend
and
was
notable
for
three
things
his
enormous
size
his
surpassing
skill
on
the
violoncello
and
his
devoted
attachment
to
the
veriest
shrew
of
a
little
wife
that
ever
crossed
from
germany
into
england
for
all
these
things
peter
loved
him
but
herr
lutz
was
never
very
actively
conscious
of
peter
because
from
the
moment
that
he
entered
herr
gottfried
attic
to
the
moment
he
left
it
his
soul
was
wrapped
in
the
music
and
in
nothing
else
whatever
as
usual
he
was
absorbed
and
after
the
second
movement
of
the
sextette
had
come
to
a
most
rapturous
conclusion
he
was
violently
dissatisfied
and
pulled
them
back
over
it
again
because
they
had
been
ragged
and
their
enthusiasm
had
got
the
better
of
their
time
and
they
were
altogether
disgraceful
villains
but
through
all
of
this
his
grey
eyes
were
upon
peter
peter
watching
from
his
dark
corner
even
felt
that
the
was
being
played
especially
for
his
benefit
and
that
herr
lutz
was
talking
all
the
time
to
him
through
the
medium
of
his
instrument
it
may
have
been
that
he
himself
was
in
a
state
of
most
exalted
emotion
and
never
until
the
end
of
all
things
mortal
and
possibly
all
things
eternal
will
he
forget
that
sextette
by
brahms
he
may
perhaps
have
put
more
into
herr
lutz
than
was
really
there
but
it
is
certain
that
he
was
conscious
of
the
german
attention
as
is
common
to
all
persons
of
his
age
and
condition
he
was
amazed
at
the
glorified
vision
of
everyday
things
in
herr
gottfried
flat
there
was
a
model
of
beethoven
in
plaster
of
paris
a
bed
and
a
tin
stand
a
tiny
bookshelf
containing
some
tattered
volumes
of
universal
bibliothek
a
piano
and
six
chairs
covered
at
the
moment
by
the
stout
bodies
of
the
six
musicians
nothing
here
to
light
the
world
with
wonder
and
yet
peter
sitting
on
a
cushion
in
a
dark
corner
watched
the
glories
of
olympus
the
music
of
heaven
was
in
his
ear
and
before
him
laughing
at
him
smiling
vanishing
only
to
reappear
more
rapturous
and
beautiful
than
ever
was
the
lady
the
wonderful
and
only
lady
his
cheeks
were
hot
and
his
heart
was
beating
so
loudly
that
it
was
surely
no
wonder
that
herr
lutz
had
discovered
his
malady
the
sextette
came
to
an
end
and
the
six
musicians
sat
for
a
moment
silent
on
their
chairs
whilst
they
dragged
themselves
into
the
world
that
they
had
for
a
moment
forsaken
that
was
a
great
instant
of
silence
when
every
one
in
the
room
was
concerned
entirely
with
their
souls
and
had
forgotten
that
they
so
much
as
had
bodies
at
all
then
herr
lutz
gathered
his
huge
frame
together
stuck
his
hand
into
his
beard
and
cried
aloud
for
drink
beer
was
provided
conversation
was
for
the
next
two
hours
volcanic
when
twelve
struck
in
the
church
round
the
corner
the
meeting
was
broken
up
herr
lutz
said
to
peter
there
is
still
the
fog
together
we
will
go
part
of
the
so
they
went
together
but
on
the
top
of
the
dark
and
crooked
staircase
herr
gottfried
stopped
peter
boy
he
said
and
he
rubbed
his
nose
with
his
finger
as
he
always
did
when
he
was
nervous
and
embarrassed
i
should
go
to
the
shop
for
a
week
or
two
if
i
were
not
go
said
peter
astonished
no
for
reason
why
well
who
knows
the
days
come
and
they
go
and
again
it
will
be
all
right
for
you
i
should
rub
up
the
editors
i
should
rub
up
the
editors
repeated
peter
still
confused
yes
have
other
irons
you
know
often
enough
other
irons
are
handy
did
zanti
tell
you
to
say
this
to
me
no
he
says
nothing
it
is
only
i
as
a
friend
you
understand
well
thank
you
very
much
said
peter
at
last
herr
gottfried
he
reflected
must
think
that
he
peter
had
mints
of
money
if
he
could
so
lightly
and
on
so
slender
a
warning
propose
his
abandoning
his
precious
two
pounds
a
week
moreover
there
was
loyalty
to
zanti
to
be
considered
anyway
what
did
it
all
mean
i
ca
go
he
said
at
last
unless
zanti
says
something
to
me
but
what
are
they
all
up
to
seven
years
said
herr
gottfried
darkly
has
the
boy
been
in
the
shop
of
so
little
enquiring
a
mind
is
and
he
would
say
nothing
further
peter
followed
herr
lutz
huge
body
into
the
street
they
took
arms
when
they
encountered
the
fog
and
went
stumbling
along
together
you
are
in
lof
said
herr
lutz
breathlessly
avoiding
a
lamp
post
yes
said
peter
i
ah
said
herr
lutz
giving
peter
arm
a
squeeze
it
is
the
only
thing
the
only
thing
however
it
may
be
for
you
bad
or
ill
whether
she
scold
or
smile
it
is
a
most
blessed
he
spoke
when
under
stress
of
emotion
in
capitals
with
a
pause
before
the
important
word
it
wo
come
to
anything
said
peter
it
ca
possibly
i
got
anything
to
offer
anybody
an
uncertain
two
pounds
a
you
have
a
career
said
herr
lutz
solemnly
i
know
i
have
often
watched
you
you
have
written
a
book
karl
gottfried
has
told
me
but
all
that
does
not
matter
he
went
on
impetuously
it
does
not
matter
what
you
get
it
is
being
in
love
the
divine
never
to
be
equalled
state
the
enormous
german
stopped
on
an
island
in
the
middle
of
the
road
and
waved
his
arms
on
every
side
of
him
through
the
darkness
the
traffic
rolled
and
thundered
he
waved
his
arms
and
exulted
because
he
had
been
married
to
a
shrew
of
a
wife
for
thirty
years
during
that
time
she
had
never
given
him
a
kind
word
not
a
loving
look
but
peter
knew
that
out
of
all
the
fog
and
obscurity
that
life
might
bring
to
him
that
word
sprung
though
it
might
be
out
of
teutonic
sentiment
and
heller
beer
that
word
at
any
rate
was
true
ii
london
in
the
morning
recovered
from
the
fog
and
prepared
to
receive
foreign
personages
they
were
not
to
arrive
for
another
week
but
it
was
some
while
since
anything
of
the
kind
had
occurred
and
london
meant
to
carry
it
out
well
the
newspapers
were
crowded
with
details
personal
anecdotes
about
the
personages
abounded
a
procession
was
to
take
place
stands
began
to
climb
into
the
air
and
the
queen
and
her
visitors
were
to
have
addresses
presented
to
them
at
intervals
during
the
progress
to
peter
this
all
seemed
supremely
unimportant
at
the
same
moment
to
confuse
little
things
with
big
ones
lazarus
suddenly
decided
to
die
she
had
been
unwell
for
many
months
and
her
brain
had
been
very
clouded
and
temper
uncertain
but
now
suddenly
she
felt
perfectly
well
her
intelligence
was
as
sharp
and
bright
as
it
had
ever
been
and
the
doctor
gave
her
a
week
at
the
utmost
she
would
like
she
said
to
have
seen
the
dear
queen
ride
through
the
streets
amidst
the
plaudits
of
the
populace
but
she
supposed
it
was
not
to
be
so
with
a
lace
cap
on
her
head
and
her
nose
sharp
and
shiny
she
sat
up
in
bed
flicked
imaginary
bread
pellets
along
the
counterpane
talked
happily
to
the
and
made
ready
to
die
the
was
immensely
moved
and
peter
during
these
days
came
back
early
from
the
bookshop
in
order
to
sit
with
her
he
was
surprised
that
he
cared
as
he
did
the
old
lady
had
been
for
so
long
a
part
of
his
daily
background
that
he
could
no
more
believe
in
her
departure
than
he
could
in
the
sudden
disappearance
of
the
dark
green
curtains
and
the
marble
pillars
in
the
she
had
had
from
the
first
a
great
liking
for
peter
he
had
never
known
how
much
of
that
affection
was
an
incoherent
madness
and
he
had
never
in
any
way
analysed
his
own
feeling
for
her
but
now
he
was
surprised
at
the
acute
sharpness
of
his
regret
on
a
bright
evening
of
sunshine
about
six
she
died
brockett
the
tressiters
norah
monogue
also
were
with
her
at
the
time
peter
had
been
with
her
alone
during
the
earlier
afternoon
and
although
she
had
been
very
weak
she
had
talked
to
him
in
her
trembling
voice
it
was
like
the
noise
that
two
needles
knocking
against
one
another
would
make
and
she
had
told
him
how
she
believed
in
him
she
made
him
ashamed
with
the
things
that
she
said
about
him
he
had
paid
her
little
enough
attention
he
thought
during
these
seven
years
there
were
so
many
things
that
he
might
have
done
as
the
afternoon
sun
streamed
into
the
room
and
the
old
lady
her
hands
like
ivory
upon
the
counterpane
fell
into
a
quiet
sleep
he
wondered
was
he
bad
or
good
was
he
strong
or
weak
these
things
that
people
said
the
affection
that
people
gave
him
he
deserved
none
of
it
surely
never
were
two
so
opposite
presences
bound
together
in
one
body
he
was
profoundly
selfish
profoundly
unselfish
loving
hard
kind
cruel
proud
humble
generous
mean
completely
possessed
entirely
uncontrolled
old
beyond
his
years
young
beyond
belief
as
he
sat
there
beside
the
sleeping
old
lady
he
felt
a
contempt
of
himself
that
was
beyond
all
expression
and
also
he
felt
a
pride
at
the
things
that
he
knew
that
he
might
do
a
pride
that
brought
the
blood
to
his
cheeks
the
man
on
the
lion
the
man
under
the
lion
paw
the
years
would
show
a
quiet
happy
serenity
passed
over
lazarus
face
and
he
called
the
others
into
the
room
stern
brockett
was
crying
lazarus
woke
for
a
moment
and
smiled
upon
them
all
she
took
peter
hand
be
good
to
old
people
she
breathed
very
faintly
then
she
closed
her
eyes
and
so
died
below
in
the
street
a
boy
was
calling
the
evening
papers
arrival
of
the
prince
and
princess
of
schloss
arrival
of
the
prince
and
they
closed
the
windows
and
pulled
down
the
blinds
ii
thursday
was
to
be
the
day
of
royal
processions
and
on
friday
old
lazarus
was
to
be
buried
to
peter
wednesday
was
a
day
of
extravagant
confusion
extravagant
because
it
was
a
day
on
which
nothing
was
done
customers
were
not
served
in
the
shop
editors
were
not
attacked
in
their
lairs
nothing
was
done
every
one
hung
about
peter
could
not
name
any
one
as
directly
responsible
for
this
state
of
things
nor
could
he
define
his
own
condition
of
mind
only
he
knew
that
he
could
not
leave
the
shop
about
its
doors
and
passages
there
fell
all
day
an
air
of
suspense
zanti
was
himself
a
little
responsible
for
this
it
was
so
unusual
for
that
large
and
smiling
gentleman
to
waste
the
day
idly
and
yet
there
he
was
starting
every
now
and
again
for
the
door
looking
into
the
empty
yard
from
the
windows
at
the
back
of
the
house
disappearing
sometimes
into
the
rooms
above
reappearing
suddenly
with
an
air
of
unconcern
a
little
too
elaborately
contrived
peter
felt
that
zanti
had
a
great
deal
that
he
would
like
to
say
to
him
and
once
or
twice
he
came
to
him
and
began
oh
i
say
boy
and
then
stopped
with
an
air
of
confusion
as
though
he
had
recollected
something
suddenly
there
was
a
russian
girl
too
who
was
about
the
shop
uneasily
on
this
day
she
was
thin
slight
very
dark
fierce
eyes
and
hands
that
seemed
to
be
always
curving
her
name
was
maria
notroska
and
she
was
engaged
to
the
big
russian
oblotzky
whom
peter
had
seen
on
other
days
up
and
down
through
the
shop
she
spoke
to
no
one
she
knew
but
little
english
but
she
would
stand
for
hours
at
the
door
looking
out
into
the
street
it
was
a
long
uneasy
day
and
peter
was
glad
when
the
evening
in
slow
straight
lines
of
golden
light
came
in
through
the
black
door
the
evening
too
seemed
to
bring
forward
a
renewed
hope
of
seeing
stephen
again
enquiries
could
bring
nothing
from
either
zanti
or
herr
gottfried
they
had
never
heard
of
the
man
oh
no
stephen
brant
stephen
no
never
that
sudden
springing
out
of
the
darkness
had
meant
something
however
peter
could
still
feel
his
wet
clothes
and
see
his
shining
beard
yes
if
there
were
any
trouble
stephen
would
be
there
what
were
they
all
about
peter
closed
the
shutters
of
the
shop
that
night
without
having
any
explanation
to
offer
zanti
was
indeed
a
strange
man
when
peter
turned
to
go
he
stopped
him
with
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
peter
boy
he
said
whispering
come
upstairs
i
have
something
to
tell
peter
was
about
to
follow
him
back
into
the
shop
when
suddenly
the
man
shook
his
head
no
not
he
said
and
almost
pushed
him
into
the
street
peter
looking
back
saw
that
he
was
talking
to
the
russian
girl
but
the
day
was
not
over
with
that
wondering
about
zanti
thinking
that
the
would
be
gloomy
now
after
lazarus
death
recalling
above
all
to
himself
every
slightest
incident
of
his
meeting
with
miss
rossiter
peter
crossing
oxford
street
flung
his
broad
body
against
a
fat
and
soft
one
there
was
nearly
a
collapse
the
other
man
and
peter
grasped
arms
to
steady
themselves
and
then
behold
the
fat
body
was
bobby
galleon
bobby
galleon
after
all
these
years
but
there
could
be
no
possible
doubt
about
it
there
he
stood
standing
back
a
little
from
the
shock
his
bowler
hat
knocked
to
one
side
of
his
head
a
deprecating
apologetic
smile
on
his
dear
fat
face
a
man
of
course
now
but
very
little
altered
in
spite
of
all
the
years
a
little
fatter
perhaps
his
body
seemed
rather
shapeless
but
those
same
kind
eyes
that
large
mouth
and
the
clear
straight
look
in
all
his
face
that
spoke
him
to
all
the
world
for
what
he
was
peter
felt
exactly
as
though
after
a
long
and
tiring
journey
he
had
tumbled
at
last
into
a
large
he
was
excited
he
waved
his
arms
bobby
bobby
he
cried
so
loudly
that
two
old
women
in
bonnets
crossing
the
road
like
a
couple
of
hens
turned
to
look
at
him
i
sorry
bobby
said
vaguely
and
then
slowly
recognition
came
into
his
eyes
peter
he
said
in
a
voice
lost
in
amazement
the
colour
flooding
his
cheeks
it
was
all
absurdly
moving
they
were
quite
ridiculously
stirred
both
of
them
the
lamps
were
coming
out
down
oxford
street
a
pale
saffron
sky
outlined
the
dark
bulk
of
the
church
that
is
opposite
mudie
shop
and
stands
back
from
the
street
a
little
as
though
it
wondered
at
all
the
noise
and
clamour
a
limpid
and
watery
blue
still
lingered
wavering
in
the
evening
sky
they
turned
into
an
shop
and
ordered
glasses
of
milk
and
they
sat
and
looked
at
one
another
they
had
altered
remarkably
little
and
to
both
of
them
although
the
roar
of
the
oxford
street
traffic
was
outside
the
window
it
might
have
been
easily
enough
that
a
clanging
bell
would
soon
summon
them
back
to
desks
and
latin
exercises
why
in
heaven
name
did
you
ever
get
out
of
my
sight
so
completely
i
wrote
to
treliss
again
and
again
but
i
do
suppose
anything
was
they
do
know
where
i
but
why
did
you
never
write
to
me
why
should
i
i
wanted
to
do
something
first
to
show
what
rot
is
that
friendship
i
call
that
the
most
selfish
thing
ever
no
obviously
enough
bobby
could
never
understand
that
kind
of
thing
with
him
once
a
friend
always
a
friend
that
is
what
life
is
for
with
peter
once
an
adventure
always
an
adventure
is
what
life
is
for
but
as
soon
as
a
friend
ceases
to
be
an
adventure
why
then
but
bobby
had
not
ceased
to
be
an
adventure
he
was
as
he
sat
there
more
of
one
than
he
had
ever
been
before
what
have
you
been
doing
all
these
years
been
in
a
in
a
bookshop
yes
selling
what
else
oh
reading
a
lot
seeing
one
or
two
people
and
some
peter
was
vague
what
after
all
had
he
been
doing
bobby
looked
at
him
tenderly
and
affectionately
you
want
seeing
after
you
look
fierce
as
you
used
to
when
you
been
having
a
bad
time
at
school
the
day
they
all
hissed
but
i
have
been
having
a
bad
time
i
had
a
jolly
good
one
by
the
way
peter
leant
forward
have
you
seen
or
heard
anything
of
cards
bobby
coloured
a
little
no
not
for
a
long
time
his
mother
died
a
great
swell
now
with
heaps
of
money
i
believe
i
not
his
sort
a
they
drank
milk
and
beamed
upon
one
another
peter
wanted
to
tell
bobby
everything
that
was
one
of
his
invaluable
qualities
that
one
did
like
telling
him
everything
talking
to
him
eagerly
now
peter
wondered
how
it
could
be
that
he
ever
managed
to
get
through
these
many
years
without
him
bobby
simply
existed
to
help
his
friends
and
that
was
the
kind
of
person
that
peter
had
so
often
wanted
but
in
it
all
in
their
talking
their
laughing
together
their
remembering
certain
catchwords
that
they
had
used
together
there
was
nothing
more
remarkable
than
their
finding
each
other
exactly
as
they
had
been
during
those
years
before
at
dawson
not
even
tremendous
statement
could
alter
that
i
married
he
said
married
bobby
blushed
yes
two
years
now
got
a
baby
she
quite
splendid
oh
peter
was
a
little
blank
somehow
this
did
remove
bobby
a
little
it
also
made
him
suddenly
strangely
old
but
it
does
make
any
difference
bobby
said
leaning
forward
eagerly
and
putting
his
hand
on
peter
arm
not
the
least
difference
you
two
will
simply
get
on
famously
i
so
often
told
her
about
you
and
we
always
been
hoping
that
you
turn
up
again
and
now
she
be
simply
but
it
made
a
difference
to
peter
nevertheless
he
went
back
a
little
into
his
shell
bobby
with
a
home
and
a
wife
and
a
baby
could
spare
time
of
course
for
ordinary
friends
but
even
here
his
conscience
pricked
him
did
he
not
know
bobby
well
enough
to
be
assured
that
he
was
as
firm
and
solid
as
a
rock
that
nothing
at
all
could
move
or
change
him
and
after
all
was
not
he
peter
wishing
to
be
engaged
and
married
and
the
father
of
a
family
and
the
owner
of
a
respectable
mansion
clare
elizabeth
rossiter
how
glorious
for
an
instant
were
the
thin
waitresses
the
little
tables
the
glass
windows
filled
with
and
eggs
peter
came
out
of
his
shell
again
i
shall
just
love
to
come
and
see
her
he
said
well
just
as
soon
as
you
can
by
jove
old
man
i
never
let
you
go
again
now
tell
me
everything
all
that
you
have
done
since
i
saw
peter
told
him
a
great
deal
not
quite
everything
he
told
him
nothing
for
instance
about
meeting
a
certain
young
lady
on
a
good
friday
afternoon
and
he
passed
over
some
of
the
scaw
house
incidents
as
speedily
as
possible
and
since
i
came
up
to
london
he
went
on
the
whole
of
my
time
has
been
spent
either
in
the
bookshop
or
the
they
awfully
good
sorts
at
both
but
it
all
very
uncertain
of
course
and
instead
of
writing
a
novel
that
no
one
will
want
to
read
i
ought
to
have
been
getting
on
to
editors
i
a
kind
of
feeling
that
the
bookshop
going
to
end
very
let
me
see
the
book
said
bobby
yes
certainly
said
peter
anyhow
we
go
on
together
from
this
time
forth
cheyne
walk
is
my
little
house
when
will
you
come
oh
i
do
think
i
can
there
are
these
processions
and
things
i
think
i
ought
to
be
in
the
shop
but
i
come
very
soon
this
is
the
name
of
my
bobby
as
he
saw
his
friend
swinging
along
pass
down
the
street
with
the
orange
lamps
throwing
chains
of
light
about
him
was
confronted
again
by
that
old
elusive
spirit
that
he
had
known
so
well
at
school
peter
liked
him
peter
was
glad
to
see
him
again
but
there
were
so
many
other
peters
so
many
doors
closed
against
intruders
bobby
would
always
to
the
end
be
for
peter
outside
these
doors
he
knew
it
quite
certainly
a
little
sadly
as
he
climbed
on
to
his
bus
what
was
there
about
peter
something
hard
fierce
wildly
hostile
a
devil
a
god
something
that
bobby
going
quietly
home
to
his
comfortable
dinner
might
watch
and
guard
and
even
love
but
something
that
he
could
never
share
now
in
the
cool
and
quiet
of
the
chelsea
embankment
as
he
walked
to
his
door
bobby
sighed
a
little
because
life
was
so
comfortable
chapter
iv
a
little
dust
i
that
night
peter
had
one
of
his
old
dreams
in
all
the
seven
years
that
he
had
been
in
london
the
visions
that
had
so
often
made
his
nights
at
scaw
house
terrible
had
never
come
to
him
now
after
so
long
an
interval
they
returned
he
thought
that
he
was
once
more
back
on
the
above
treliss
that
the
wind
was
blowing
in
a
tempest
and
that
the
sea
below
him
was
foaming
on
to
the
rocks
he
could
see
those
rocks
like
sharp
black
teeth
stretching
up
to
him
a
grey
sky
was
above
his
head
and
to
his
right
stretched
the
grey
and
undulating
moor
round
the
bend
of
the
road
beyond
the
point
that
he
could
see
he
thought
that
clare
rossiter
was
waiting
for
him
he
must
get
there
before
it
struck
eleven
or
something
terrible
would
happen
to
him
only
a
few
minutes
remained
to
him
and
only
a
little
stretch
of
the
thin
white
road
but
two
things
prevented
his
progress
first
the
wind
blew
so
fiercely
in
his
face
that
it
drove
him
back
and
for
every
step
that
he
took
forward
although
his
head
was
bent
and
his
teeth
set
he
seemed
to
lose
two
also
across
the
moor
voices
cried
to
him
and
they
seemed
to
him
like
the
voices
of
stephen
and
bobby
galleon
and
they
were
pleading
to
him
to
stop
he
paused
to
listen
but
the
cries
mingled
softly
with
the
wind
and
he
could
hear
bells
from
the
town
below
the
road
begin
to
strike
eleven
the
sweat
was
pouring
from
him
she
was
waiting
for
him
and
if
he
did
not
reach
her
all
would
be
lost
he
would
never
see
her
again
he
began
to
cry
to
beat
against
the
wind
with
his
hands
the
voices
grew
louder
the
wind
more
vehement
the
jagged
edges
of
the
rocks
sharper
in
their
outline
the
bells
were
still
striking
but
as
at
last
breathless
a
sharp
terror
at
his
heart
he
turned
the
corner
there
fell
suddenly
a
silence
at
last
he
was
there
only
a
few
trees
blowing
a
little
a
little
white
dust
curling
over
the
road
as
though
there
had
been
no
rain
and
then
suddenly
the
laughing
face
of
cards
no
longer
now
a
boy
but
a
man
more
handsome
than
ever
laughing
at
him
as
he
battled
round
the
corner
cards
shouted
something
to
him
suddenly
the
road
was
gone
and
peter
was
in
the
water
fighting
for
his
life
he
felt
all
the
breathless
terror
of
approaching
death
he
was
sinking
black
silent
water
rose
above
and
around
him
for
an
instant
he
caught
once
more
the
sight
of
sky
and
land
cards
was
still
on
the
road
and
beside
him
was
a
woman
whose
face
peter
could
not
see
cards
was
still
laughing
then
in
the
darkening
light
the
grey
hill
was
visible
against
the
horizon
and
instead
of
the
giant
finger
there
was
that
figure
of
the
rider
on
the
lion
the
waters
closed
peter
woke
to
a
grey
stormy
morning
the
sweat
was
pouring
down
his
face
his
body
was
burning
hot
and
his
hands
were
trembling
ii
when
he
came
down
to
breakfast
his
head
was
aching
and
heavy
and
brockett
boiled
egg
and
hard
crackling
toast
were
impossible
miss
monogue
had
things
to
tell
him
about
the
book
it
was
wonderful
tremendous
beyond
everything
that
she
had
believed
possible
but
strangely
enough
he
was
scarcely
interested
he
was
pleased
of
course
but
he
was
weighted
with
the
sense
of
overhanging
catastrophe
the
green
bulging
curtains
the
row
of
black
beads
about
brockett
thin
neck
the
untidy
everything
depressed
him
i
have
had
a
rotten
night
he
said
nightmares
i
suppose
i
ate
something
anyhow
it
a
gloomy
yes
said
miss
monogue
pinning
some
of
her
hair
in
at
the
wrong
place
and
unpinning
other
parts
of
it
that
happened
by
accident
to
be
right
i
afraid
it
a
poor
sort
of
day
for
the
procession
but
miss
black
and
i
are
going
to
do
our
best
to
see
it
it
may
clear
up
he
had
forgotten
about
the
procession
and
he
wished
that
she
would
keep
her
hair
tidier
he
wanted
to
ask
her
whether
she
had
seen
miss
rossiter
but
had
not
the
courage
a
little
misty
rain
made
feathery
noises
against
the
well
i
must
go
down
to
the
shop
he
said
finding
his
umbrella
in
the
hall
i
think
it
superb
she
said
referring
back
to
the
book
you
be
having
to
go
down
to
the
shop
much
it
was
really
surprising
that
he
cared
so
little
he
banged
the
door
behind
him
and
did
not
see
her
eyes
as
she
watched
him
go
processions
be
damned
he
wished
that
the
wet
shining
street
were
not
so
strangely
like
the
at
treliss
and
that
the
omnibuses
at
a
distance
did
not
murmur
like
the
sea
people
black
and
funereal
were
filling
stands
down
oxford
street
soldiers
were
already
lining
the
way
the
music
of
bands
could
be
heard
some
streets
away
he
was
in
a
thoroughly
bad
temper
and
scowled
at
the
people
who
passed
him
he
hated
royal
processions
he
hated
the
bookshop
he
hated
all
his
friends
and
he
wished
that
he
were
dead
here
he
had
been
seven
years
he
reflected
and
nothing
had
been
done
where
was
his
city
paved
with
gold
where
his
fame
where
his
glory
he
even
found
himself
envying
those
old
treliss
days
there
at
any
rate
things
had
happened
there
had
been
an
air
a
spirit
fighting
his
father
or
at
any
rate
escaping
from
his
father
had
been
something
vital
and
here
he
was
now
an
useless
youth
earning
two
pounds
a
week
in
love
with
some
one
who
was
scarcely
conscious
of
his
existence
he
cursed
the
futility
of
it
all
and
so
fuming
he
crossed
the
threshold
of
the
bookshop
and
unwitting
heedless
left
for
ever
behind
him
the
first
period
of
his
history
programme
of
the
royal
procession
a
man
was
shouting
coloured
with
programme
of
royal
procession
peter
stepping
into
the
dark
shop
was
conscious
of
zanti
white
face
and
that
behind
him
was
standing
stephen
iii
at
the
sight
of
their
faces
of
their
motionless
bodies
and
at
the
solemn
odd
expression
of
their
eyes
as
they
looked
past
him
into
the
dark
expanse
of
the
door
through
which
he
had
entered
he
knew
that
something
was
very
wrong
he
had
known
it
plainly
enough
by
the
fact
of
stephen
presence
there
but
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
known
it
from
his
first
awakening
that
morning
and
that
he
was
only
waiting
to
change
into
hard
outline
the
misty
shapelessness
of
his
earlier
fears
but
there
and
then
he
was
to
know
nothing
stephen
greeted
him
with
a
great
as
though
he
had
met
him
only
the
day
before
and
zanti
with
a
smile
gave
him
his
accustomed
greeting
in
the
doorway
at
the
other
end
of
the
shop
the
russian
girl
was
standing
one
arm
on
the
staring
with
her
dark
eyes
straight
through
into
the
gloomy
street
what
are
you
all
waiting
for
peter
said
to
the
motionless
figures
with
his
words
they
seemed
at
once
to
spring
to
life
zanti
rolled
his
big
body
casually
to
the
door
and
looked
down
the
street
stephen
smiling
at
peter
said
i
was
just
passing
so
i
thought
to
myself
i
just
look
in
his
voice
came
from
his
beard
like
the
roll
of
the
sea
from
a
cave
just
for
an
hour
maybe
it
a
long
day
since
we
a
bit
of
a
chat
peter
could
not
take
it
on
that
casual
scale
here
was
stephen
vanished
during
all
those
years
returned
now
suddenly
and
with
as
little
fuss
as
possible
as
though
indeed
he
had
only
been
hiding
no
farther
than
behind
the
door
of
the
shop
and
waiting
merely
to
walk
out
when
the
right
moment
should
have
arrived
if
he
had
been
no
farther
than
that
then
it
was
unkind
of
him
he
might
have
known
how
badly
peter
had
wanted
him
if
on
the
other
hand
he
had
been
farther
afield
then
he
should
show
more
excitement
at
his
return
but
peter
thought
it
was
impossible
to
recognise
in
the
grave
reserved
figure
at
his
side
that
stephen
who
had
once
given
him
the
most
glorious
evening
of
his
life
the
connection
was
there
somewhere
but
many
things
must
have
happened
between
those
years
shall
we
go
and
have
luncheon
together
peter
asked
stephen
appeared
to
fling
a
troubled
look
in
the
direction
of
zanti
broad
back
he
hesitated
well
he
said
awkwardly
i
rightly
know
i
got
to
be
going
out
for
an
hour
or
two
i
rightly
say
as
i
be
back
this
afternoon
maybe
peter
did
not
press
it
any
farther
they
must
settle
these
things
for
themselves
but
what
was
the
matter
with
them
all
this
morning
was
more
than
he
could
pretend
to
discover
stephen
still
troubled
went
out
fortunately
there
was
this
morning
a
good
deal
of
work
for
peter
to
do
a
large
number
of
books
had
arrived
during
the
day
before
and
they
must
be
catalogued
and
arranged
moreover
there
were
several
customers
a
young
lady
wanted
something
about
wagner
just
a
description
of
the
plays
you
of
the
operas
peter
corrected
oh
well
the
stories
that
what
i
want
something
about
two
shillings
have
you
i
do
think
it
really
worth
more
but
so
that
one
will
know
where
one
is
you
she
was
bright
and
confidential
she
had
thought
that
everything
would
be
closed
because
of
the
procession
lucky
a
short
woman
dressed
in
bright
colours
and
carrying
innumerable
little
parcels
wanted
under
two
flags
by
henry
wood
it
by
ouida
madam
peter
told
her
nonsense
do
tell
me
as
if
i
did
peter
produced
the
volume
and
showed
it
to
her
she
dropped
some
of
her
parcels
they
both
went
to
pick
them
up
red
in
the
face
she
glared
at
him
really
it
too
provoking
i
know
it
was
henry
wood
i
perhaps
lynne
or
channings
nonsense
do
tell
me
it
was
two
flags
finally
the
woman
put
both
under
two
flags
and
east
lynne
into
her
bag
and
departed
a
silence
fell
upon
the
shop
herr
gottfried
was
at
his
desk
zanti
at
the
street
door
the
girl
at
the
door
of
the
inner
room
they
were
all
motionless
beyond
the
shop
the
murmur
of
the
gathering
crowd
was
like
the
confused
blundering
hum
of
bees
a
band
was
playing
stridently
in
oxford
street
once
peter
said
it
passes
about
does
it
i
think
just
go
out
and
have
a
look
later
it
be
fine
if
only
the
sun
zanti
turned
slowly
round
i
afraid
boy
he
said
you
be
wanted
in
ze
shop
at
two
herr
gottfried
must
be
going
out
for
some
business
zere
will
be
no
one
i
am
zo
they
wanted
to
keep
him
there
that
was
evident
or
at
any
rate
they
did
want
him
to
see
the
procession
very
well
he
said
cheerfully
i
stay
there
be
plenty
more
processions
before
i
but
why
why
why
what
was
there
that
they
wanted
him
to
avoid
he
went
on
arranging
the
piles
of
dusty
books
the
sense
of
weighty
expectation
growing
on
him
with
every
instant
the
clock
struck
one
but
he
did
not
go
out
to
luncheon
the
others
were
still
motionless
in
their
places
once
herr
gottfried
spoke
the
people
will
have
been
waiting
a
long
time
he
said
the
police
doubtless
have
frightened
them
but
there
is
still
room
to
walk
in
the
streets
and
there
have
been
some
unfortunates
since
early
in
the
morning
the
street
beyond
the
shop
was
now
deserted
because
soldiers
guarded
its
approach
into
oxford
street
the
shop
seemed
to
be
left
high
and
dry
beyond
the
noise
and
confusion
of
the
street
then
there
came
into
the
silence
a
sharp
sound
that
made
peter
amongst
his
books
jump
to
his
feet
the
russian
girl
was
crying
she
stood
there
leaning
her
thin
dark
body
against
the
side
of
the
door
surely
the
most
desolate
figure
in
the
world
her
hands
were
about
her
face
her
body
heaved
with
her
sobbing
and
the
little
sad
noise
came
into
the
dusty
tangled
room
and
hung
amongst
the
old
broken
books
as
though
they
only
could
sympathise
and
give
it
shelter
the
band
in
oxford
street
was
blazing
with
sound
but
it
did
not
hide
her
crying
zanti
crossed
to
her
and
spoke
to
her
but
she
suddenly
let
her
hands
fall
from
her
face
and
turned
upon
him
furiously
wildly
you
she
said
you
and
then
as
though
the
words
choked
her
she
turned
back
into
the
inner
room
peter
saw
zanti
face
and
it
was
puckered
with
distress
like
a
child
it
was
almost
laughable
in
its
helpless
dismay
two
struck
they
be
starting
in
half
an
hour
herr
gottfried
said
women
zanti
said
still
looking
distressfully
about
him
they
are
in
truth
very
and
now
there
was
no
pretence
any
longer
of
disguising
the
nervous
tension
that
was
with
them
in
the
room
they
were
all
waiting
for
something
what
it
might
be
peter
did
not
know
but
with
every
tick
of
the
old
brass
clock
some
event
crept
more
nearly
towards
them
then
stephen
came
back
he
came
in
very
quietly
as
though
he
were
trying
to
keep
the
note
of
agitation
that
he
must
have
felt
on
every
side
of
him
as
near
the
normal
as
possible
his
face
above
his
beard
was
grey
and
streaky
and
his
breath
came
rapidly
as
though
he
had
been
running
when
he
saw
zanti
his
hand
went
up
suddenly
in
front
of
his
face
as
though
he
would
protect
himself
from
the
other
questioning
i
nothing
he
said
almost
sullenly
and
then
he
turned
and
looked
at
peter
why
must
be
he
said
sharply
to
zanti
why
not
where
else
the
other
answered
and
the
two
men
watched
each
other
with
hostility
across
the
floor
i
wish
we
all
bloomin
wull
kept
out
of
it
stephen
murmured
to
himself
it
seemed
peter
eyes
were
upon
zanti
that
gentleman
looked
more
like
a
naughty
child
than
ever
in
his
eyes
there
was
the
piteous
appeal
of
a
small
boy
about
to
be
punished
for
some
grievous
fault
in
some
strange
way
peter
was
it
appeared
his
court
of
appeal
because
he
glanced
towards
him
again
and
again
and
then
looked
away
peter
could
stand
it
no
longer
he
got
up
from
the
place
where
he
was
and
faced
them
all
what
is
it
what
have
you
all
done
what
is
the
matter
with
you
all
the
russian
girl
had
come
back
her
face
was
white
and
her
hair
fell
untidily
about
her
eyes
she
came
forward
fiercely
as
though
she
would
have
answered
peter
but
zanti
motioned
her
back
with
his
hand
no
no
he
said
almost
imploringly
let
the
boy
be
what
has
he
to
do
with
all
this
leave
him
he
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
he
knows
but
i
ought
to
know
peter
burst
in
why
have
i
been
kept
in
the
dark
all
this
time
what
right
have
you
he
broke
off
suddenly
absolute
silence
fell
amongst
them
all
and
they
stood
looking
at
the
door
motionless
in
their
places
there
was
a
new
note
in
the
murmuring
of
the
crowd
and
the
swift
steady
passing
of
it
came
up
the
street
to
the
shop
and
in
at
the
door
voices
could
be
heard
rising
above
others
and
then
the
eager
passing
of
some
piece
of
news
from
one
to
another
no
one
in
the
shop
spoke
outside
in
the
deserted
street
there
was
silence
and
then
the
bands
as
though
driven
by
some
common
wave
of
feeling
seemed
at
the
same
moment
to
burst
into
a
blare
of
music
some
voice
from
the
crowd
started
god
save
the
queen
and
immediately
it
was
taken
up
and
flung
into
the
air
by
a
thousand
voices
they
must
give
vent
to
their
feelings
some
news
had
passed
down
the
crowds
like
a
flame
setting
fire
to
a
chain
of
beacons
what
is
it
peter
pressed
forwards
to
the
door
and
at
once
he
was
answered
men
were
running
past
the
shop
crying
out
one
stopped
for
an
instant
and
wild
with
excitement
his
hands
gesticulating
stammering
the
words
tumbling
from
his
lips
he
shouted
at
them
bin
flinging
bombs
dirty
foreigners
up
there
by
the
marble
arch
flinging
them
at
the
old
lady
but
it
all
right
by
gawd
only
blew
up
dirty
foreigner
little
bits
of
and
no
one
else
and
now
the
old
lady
comin
down
the
street
she
be
in
quarter
of
an
and
wo
we
show
by
gawd
their
dirty
bombs
up
there
by
the
marble
arch
and
killin
nobody
but
gawd
save
the
old
lady
he
rushed
on
so
that
was
it
peter
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
looked
at
them
all
and
understood
at
last
amongst
whom
he
had
been
working
these
seven
years
they
were
murderers
the
lot
of
them
all
of
them
gottfried
zanti
stephen
oh
god
stephen
he
understood
now
for
what
they
had
been
waiting
he
turned
sick
at
the
sudden
realisation
of
it
it
did
not
at
first
seem
to
touch
himself
in
any
way
at
the
first
immediate
knowledge
of
it
he
had
been
faced
by
its
amazing
incongruity
there
by
the
marble
arch
with
bands
flying
flags
waving
in
all
the
tumult
of
a
royal
progress
some
one
had
been
blown
into
little
pieces
elsewhere
there
were
people
waiting
eating
buns
out
of
paper
bags
and
here
in
the
shop
the
sun
lighted
the
backs
of
rows
of
novels
and
down
in
treliss
the
water
was
very
gently
lapping
the
little
wooden
jetty
oh
the
silly
jumbling
of
things
in
this
silly
jumbling
world
and
then
he
began
to
look
more
closely
into
it
as
it
concerned
himself
he
saw
with
amazing
clearness
he
knew
that
it
was
oblotzky
the
tall
russian
who
had
been
killed
he
knew
because
oblotzky
was
the
lover
of
this
russian
girl
and
he
turned
round
to
watch
her
curiously
as
one
who
was
outside
it
all
she
was
standing
with
her
back
against
the
wall
her
hands
spread
out
flat
looking
through
the
door
into
the
bright
street
seeing
none
of
them
then
she
turned
and
said
something
in
russian
between
her
clenched
teeth
to
zanti
he
would
have
answered
her
but
very
quietly
and
speaking
now
in
english
she
flung
at
him
as
though
it
had
been
a
stone
god
curse
you
you
drove
him
to
it
then
she
turned
round
and
left
the
room
but
the
tall
man
was
blubbering
like
a
child
he
had
turned
round
to
them
all
with
his
hands
outstretched
appealing
but
it
not
true
he
cried
between
his
sobs
it
not
true
i
did
all
i
could
to
stop
them
i
did
not
know
that
they
would
do
things
not
really
until
now
this
morning
when
it
was
too
late
it
is
the
others
sergius
paslov
odinsky
zey
were
always
wild
desperate
but
we
the
rest
of
us
with
us
it
was
only
tall
little
herr
gottfried
who
had
been
silent
behind
them
came
forward
now
and
spoke
it
is
too
late
he
said
for
this
crying
like
a
baby
we
have
no
time
we
must
consider
what
must
be
done
if
it
is
true
what
that
man
says
that
oblotzky
has
blown
himself
up
and
no
other
is
touched
then
no
harm
is
done
why
regret
the
russian
he
wanted
a
violent
end
and
he
has
got
it
and
he
has
given
it
to
no
other
often
enough
we
are
not
so
fortunate
he
will
have
spoken
to
no
one
we
are
then
he
turned
to
peter
poor
boy
he
said
but
peter
was
not
there
to
be
pitied
he
had
only
one
thought
stephen
tell
me
tell
me
you
did
not
know
you
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
stephen
turned
and
faced
him
no
peter
boy

i
did
not
know
what
they
were
at
they
zanti

when
i

me
peter

it

something

waiting
until
you
wanted
zanti
turned
furiously
upon
him
but
the
words
that
he
would
have
spoken
were
for
the
moment
held
the
procession
was
passing
the
roar
of
cheering
came
up
against
the
walls
of
the
shop
like
waves
against
the
rocks
the
windows
shook
there
she
was
the
little
old
lady
in
her
black
bonnet
sitting
smiling
and
bowing
and
somewhere
behind
her
a
little
dust
had
been
blown
into
the
air
had
hung
for
a
moment
about
her
and
then
had
once
more
settled
down
into
the
other
dust
from
which
it
had
come
that
was
all
in
front
of
her
were
the
royal
personages
on
every
side
of
her
her
faithful
subjects
only
a
cloud
of
dust
had
given
occasion
for
a
surer
sign
of
her
people
devotion
that
at
any
rate
oblotzky
had
done
the
carriage
passed
zanti
now
faced
peter

still
like

small
boy

minute

hated

but
peter
face
was
set
the
time
for
the
new
life
had
come
up
to
this
moment
he
had
been
passive
he
had
used
his
life
as
an
instrument
on
which
others
might
play
from
henceforward
his
should
be
the
active
part
the
crowds
were
pouring
up
the
street
on
their
homeward
way
bands
were
playing
the
soldiers
back
to
the
barracks
soon
the
streets
would
have
only
the
paper
bags
left
to
them
for
company
the
little
bookshop
hung
with
its
misty
shelves
about
the
three
men
somewhere
in
another
room
a
girl
was
staring
with
white
set
face
and
burning
eyes
in
front
of
her
for
her
lover
was
dead
and
the
world
had
died
with
him
after
a
little
time
amongst
the
novels
zanti
sat
his
great
head
buried
in
his
hands
the
tears
trickling
down
through
his
fingers
and
herr
gottfried
motionless
from
behind
his
counter
watched
him
in
silent
sympathy
peter
and
stephen
had
gone
together
chapter
v
a
narrow
street
i
the
bomb
was
that
evening
the
dominant
note
of
the
occasion
through
the
illuminated
streets
the
slowly
surging
crowds
inhuman
in
their
abandon
to
the
monotonous
ebb
and
flow
as
of
a
sweeping
river
the
cries
and
laughter
and
shouting
of
songs
that
note
was
above
all
an
a
frank
harris
butcher
of
cheapside
had
his
veracious
account
journalistically
doctored
i
was
standing
quite
close
to
the
man
a
foreigner
of
course
with
a
dirty
hanging
black
moustache
tall
big
fellow
with
coat
up
over
his
ears
i
must
say
that
i
was
looking
at
him
i
had
harris
with
me
and
was
trying
to
get
her
a
place
where
she
could
see
better
you
understand
then
suddenly
before
one
was
expecting
it
the
procession
began
and
i
forgot
the
man
the
foreigner
although
he
was
quite
up
close
against
me
one
was
excited
of
course
a
most
moving
sight
and
then
suddenly
when
by
the
distant
shouting
we
understood
that
the
queen
was
approaching
i
saw
the
man
break
through
i
was
conscious
of
the
man
vigour
as
he
rushed
past
he
must
have
been
immensely
strong
because
there
he
was
through
the
soldiers
and
everybody
out
in
the
middle
of
the
street
it
all
happened
so
quickly
of
course
i
heard
vaguely
that
some
one
was
shouting
and
i
think
a
policeman
started
forward
but
anyhow
the
man
raised
his
arm
and
in
an
instant
there
was
the
explosion
it
went
off
before
he
was
ready
i
suppose
but
the
ground
rocked
under
one
feet
two
soldiers
fell
unhurt
i
have
learnt
since
there
was
a
hideous
dust
horses
plunging
and
men
shouting
and
then
suddenly
silence
the
dust
cleared
and
there
was
a
hole
in
the
ground
stones
rooted
up
no
sign
of
the
man
but
some
pieces
of
cloth
and
men
had
rushed
forward
and
covered
something
up
a
limb
i
suppose
i
was
only
anxious
of
course
that
my
wife
should
see
nothing
she
was
considerably
affected
so
harris
of
cheapside
with
the
assistance
of
an
eager
and
talented
young
journalist
but
the
fact
remained
in
the
heart
of
the
crowd
blasted
foreigner
had
had
a
shot
at
the
old
lady
and
missed
her
therefore
whatever
gaiety
may
have
been
originally
intended
let
it
now
be
redoubled
shouted
into
frenzy
and
frenzy
it
was
there
was
no
clue
an
evening
paper
added
to
the
identity
the
police
were
blamed
of
course
such
a
thing
must
never
be
allowed
to
occur
again
it
was
reported
that
the
queen
had
in
no
way
suffered
from
the
shock
was
in
capital
health
outside
the
bookshop
stephen
and
peter
had
parted
i
meet
you
about
ten
trafalgar
square
by
the
lion
that
faces
whitehall
i
must
go
back
to
brockett
have
supper
and
get
my
things
and
say
then
i
join
you
peter
boy
we
have
to
rough
it
oh
at
last
life
beginning
we
soon
get
work
both
of
us
where
do
you
mean
to
go
there
a
place
i
been
before
down
east
end
not
much
of
a
place
for
your
sort
but
just
for
a
bit
for
a
moment
peter
thoughts
swept
back
to
the
shop
poor
zanti
he
half
turned
after
so
many
years
the
good
old
then
he
pulled
himself
up
and
set
his
shoulders
well
ten
the
streets
were
at
the
instant
almost
deserted
it
was
about
five
now
and
at
seven
they
would
be
closed
to
all
traffic
then
the
surging
crowds
would
come
sweeping
down
peter
furiously
excited
hurried
through
the
grimy
deserts
of
bloomsbury
to
brockett
to
his
singing
beating
heart
the
thin
ribbon
of
the
grey
street
with
the
faint
dim
blue
of
the
evening
sky
was
out
of
place
as
a
setting
to
his
exultations
he
had
swept
in
the
tempestuous
way
that
was
natural
to
him
the
shop
and
all
that
it
had
been
to
him
behind
him
even
brockett
must
go
with
the
rest
of
course
he
could
not
stay
there
now
that
the
weekly
two
pounds
had
stopped
he
quite
savagely
desired
to
be
free
from
all
business
these
seven
years
had
been
well
enough
as
a
preparation
now
at
last
he
was
to
be
flung
head
foremost
into
life
he
could
have
sung
he
could
have
shouted
he
burst
through
the
heavy
doors
of
brockett
but
there
inside
the
quiet
and
solemn
building
another
mood
seized
him
he
crept
quietly
on
tiptoe
up
to
his
room
because
he
did
not
want
to
see
any
of
them
before
supper
after
all
he
was
leaving
the
best
friends
that
he
had
ever
had
the
only
home
that
he
had
ever
really
known
brockett
norah
monogue
robin
the
signor
seven
years
is
a
long
time
and
one
gets
fond
of
a
place
he
closed
his
bedroom
door
softly
behind
him
the
little
room
had
been
very
much
to
him
during
all
these
years
and
that
view
over
the
london
roofs
would
never
be
forgotten
by
him
but
he
wondered
as
he
looked
at
it
how
he
had
ever
been
able
to
sit
there
so
quietly
and
write
reuben
now
between
his
writing
and
himself
a
thousand
things
were
sweeping
far
away
he
saw
it
like
the
height
of
some
inaccessible
hill
his
emotions
his
adventures
the
excitement
of
life
made
his
thoughts
his
ideas
thinner
than
smoke
he
even
standing
there
in
his
little
room
and
looking
over
the
london
roofs
despised
the
inaction
often
again
he
was
to
know
that
rivalry
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
supper
he
went
down
to
say
to
miss
monogue
she
was
sitting
quietly
reading
and
he
thought
suddenly
as
he
came
upon
her
there
under
the
light
of
her
candles
in
the
grey
room
that
she
did
not
look
well
he
had
never
during
their
seven
friendship
noticed
anything
before
and
now
he
could
not
have
said
what
it
was
that
he
saw
except
perhaps
that
her
cheeks
were
flushed
and
that
there
were
heavy
dark
lines
beneath
her
eyes
but
she
seemed
to
him
as
he
took
her
thus
unprepared
with
her
untidy
hair
and
her
white
cheap
evening
dress
that
showed
her
thin
fragile
arms
to
be
something
that
he
was
leaving
to
face
the
world
alone
something
very
delicate
that
he
ought
not
to
leave
then
she
looked
up
and
saw
him
and
put
her
book
down
and
smiled
at
him
and
was
the
old
cheerful
norah
monogue
whom
he
had
always
known
he
stood
with
his
legs
apart
facing
her
and
told
her
i
come
to
say
yes
i
going
what
i
been
expecting
for
so
long
has
happened
at
last
there
been
a
blow
up
at
the
bookshop
and
i
got
to
for
an
instant
the
colour
left
her
face
her
book
fell
to
the
ground
and
she
put
her
hand
back
on
the
arm
of
the
chair
to
steady
herself
oh
how
silly
of
me
never
mind
picking
it
up
oh
thank
you
peter
you
gave
me
quite
a
shock
telling
me
like
that
we
shall
all
miss
you
his
affection
for
her
was
strong
enough
to
break
in
upon
the
great
overwhelming
excited
exultation
that
had
held
him
all
the
evening
he
was
dreadfully
sorry
to
leave
her
dear
norah
monogue
what
a
pal
she
been
i
shall
miss
you
horribly
he
said
with
that
note
in
his
voice
that
showed
that
above
all
things
he
wished
to
avoid
a
scene
we
been
such
tremendous
pals
all
this
time
you
been
such
a
brick
i
know
what
i
should
have
done
he
pulled
himself
up
but
it
got
to
be
i
felt
it
coming
you
know
and
it
time
i
really
lashed
out
for
where
are
you
going
ah
i
must
keep
that
dark
for
a
bit
there
been
trouble
at
the
bookshop
it
be
all
right
i
expect
but
i
do
want
mother
brockett
to
stand
any
chance
of
being
mixed
up
in
it
i
shall
just
disappear
for
a
week
or
two
and
then
i
be
back
she
smiled
at
him
bravely
well
i
wo
ask
what
happened
if
you
do
want
to
tell
me
but
of
course
i
shall
miss
you
after
seven
years
it
seems
so
abrupt
and
peter
do
take
care
of
oh
i
shall
be
all
he
was
very
gruff
he
felt
now
a
furious
angry
reluctance
at
leaving
her
behind
he
stormed
at
himself
as
a
fool
one
of
the
things
that
the
strong
man
must
learn
of
life
is
to
be
ruthless
in
these
partings
and
breaking
of
relations
he
stood
further
away
from
her
and
spoke
as
though
he
hated
being
there
she
understood
him
with
wonderful
tenderness
well
she
said
cheerfully
i
daresay
it
will
be
better
for
you
to
try
for
a
little
and
see
what
you
can
make
of
it
all
and
then
if
you
want
anything
you
come
back
to
us
wo
you
you
promise
that
of
and
then
there
the
book
i
know
that
man
in
heriot
and
lord
that
i
told
you
about
i
send
it
to
them
right
away
if
you
are
they
rather
tremendous
people
for
me
to
begin
with
ought
i
to
begin
with
some
one
smaller
oh
there
no
harm
in
starting
at
the
top
they
ca
do
more
than
refuse
it
but
i
do
think
they
will
i
believe
in
it
but
how
shall
i
let
you
know
what
they
say
oh
i
come
in
a
week
or
two
and
see
what
happening
i
be
on
a
paper
by
then
probably
i
say
i
do
want
the
others
to
know
have
supper
with
them
as
usual
and
just
tell
mother
brockett
afterwards
i
do
want
to
have
to
say
lots
of
times
well
he
moved
off
awkwardly
towards
the
door
you
been
most
tremendously
good
to
rot
peter
do
forget
me
forget
you
the
best
pal
i
ever
they
clasped
hands
for
a
moment
there
was
a
pause
and
then
peter
said
i
say
there
a
thing
you
can
do
if
you
like
yes
anything
well
about
miss
rossiter
you
be
seeing
her
i
suppose
oh
yes
often
well
you
might
just
keep
her
in
mind
of
me
i
know
it
sounds
silly
but
just
a
word
or
two
he
felt
that
he
was
blushing
their
hands
separated
she
moved
back
from
him
and
pushed
at
her
hair
in
the
nervous
way
that
she
had
why
of
course
she
was
awfully
interested
she
wo
forget
you
well
we
meet
at
she
moved
back
with
a
last
little
nod
at
him
and
he
went
awkwardly
out
of
the
room
with
a
curious
little
sense
of
sudden
dismissal
would
she
rather
he
did
know
miss
rossiter
he
vaguely
wondered
women
were
such
queer
creatures
as
he
went
downstairs
he
wondered
with
a
sudden
almost
shameful
confusion
whether
he
was
responsible
in
some
way
for
the
awkwardness
that
the
scene
had
had
he
had
noticed
lately
that
she
had
not
been
quite
herself
when
he
had
been
with
her
that
she
would
stop
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
that
she
would
be
for
instance
vexed
at
something
he
said
that
she
would
look
at
him
sometimes
as
though
he
pulled
himself
up
he
was
angry
with
himself
for
imagining
such
a
thing
as
though
well
women
strange
creatures
and
then
supper
was
more
difficult
than
he
had
expected
they
would
show
him
the
silly
things
that
they
were
fond
of
him
just
when
he
would
much
rather
have
persuaded
himself
that
they
hated
him
it
was
almost
as
he
told
himself
furiously
as
though
they
knew
that
he
was
going
norah
monogue
was
the
only
person
who
chattered
and
laughed
in
a
natural
way
he
was
rather
relieved
that
after
all
she
seemed
to
care
so
little
he
found
that
he
could
eat
there
was
a
silly
lump
in
his
throat
and
he
looked
at
the
marble
pillars
and
the
heavy
curtains
through
a
kind
of
mist
especially
was
there
robin
tressiter
told
him
that
robin
had
something
very
important
to
say
to
him
and
that
he
was
going
to
stay
awake
until
he
peter
came
up
to
him
i
told
him
she
said
that
he
must
lie
down
and
go
to
sleep
like
a
good
boy
and
that
his
father
would
punish
him
if
he
did
but
there
what
the
use
of
it
he
is
afraid
of
his
father
the
slightest
he
would
go
on
something
about
a
lion
at
any
rate
this
gave
peter
an
excuse
to
escape
from
the
table
and
it
was
indeed
time
for
they
had
all
settled
like
a
clatter
of
hens
on
to
the
subject
of
the
bomb
and
they
all
had
a
great
deal
to
say
about
it
and
a
great
many
questions
to
ask
peter
it
these
foreigners
of
course
our
police
are
entirely
yes
that
what
i
say
the
police
are
really
absurdly
inadequate
if
they
will
allow
these
foreigners
yes
what
can
you
expect
and
the
police
really
ca
peter
escaped
to
robin
he
glowered
down
at
the
child
who
was
sitting
up
in
his
cot
counting
the
flowers
on
the
old
to
keep
himself
awake
i
always
am
so
muddled
after
fourteen
he
said
never
mind
i
sleeping
peter
frowned
at
him
you
ought
to
have
been
asleep
long
ago
he
said
he
wished
the
boy
had
got
his
hair
tousled
in
that
absurdly
fascinating
way
and
that
his
cheeks
were
flushed
so
beautiful
a
red
also
his
nightgown
had
lost
a
button
at
the
top
and
showed
a
very
white
little
neck
peter
blinked
his
eyes
look
here
kid
you
must
go
to
sleep
right
away
at
once
what
do
you
want
it
that
lion
the
one
the
lady
had
i
want
you
ca
have
it
the
lady
got
well
take
me
to
see
them
the
real
ones
there
are
lots
somewhere
mother
robin
inserted
his
very
small
hand
into
peter
large
one
all
right
one
day
we
go
to
the
robin
sighed
with
satisfaction
he
lay
down
and
murmured
sleepily
to
himself
i
love
mister
peter
and
lions
and
mother
and
god
and
was
suddenly
asleep
peter
bent
down
over
the
cot
and
kissed
him
he
felt
miserably
wretched
he
had
known
nothing
like
it
since
that
day
when
he
had
said
to
his
mother
he
wondered
that
he
could
ever
have
felt
any
exultation
he
wondered
that
writing
and
glory
and
ambition
could
ever
have
seemed
worth
anything
to
him
at
all
could
he
have
had
his
prayer
granted
he
would
have
prayed
that
he
might
always
stay
in
brockett
always
have
these
same
friends
watch
over
robin
as
he
grew
up
talk
to
norah
monogue
and
then
all
the
others
and
zanti
he
felt
fourteen
years
old
more
miserable
than
he
had
ever
been
he
kissed
robin
again
then
he
went
down
to
find
brockett
here
too
he
was
faced
with
an
unexpected
difficulty
the
good
lady
listening
to
him
sternly
in
her
grim
little
refused
to
hear
of
his
departure
she
sat
upright
in
her
stiff
chair
her
thin
black
dress
in
folds
about
her
the
shining
on
her
neatly
parted
hair
you
see
brockett
he
explained
to
her
i
no
longer
in
the
same
position
i
ca
be
sure
of
my
two
pounds
a
week
any
more
and
so
it
would
be
right
for
me
to
live
in
a
place
like
if
it
expense
that
you
thinking
about
she
answered
him
grimly
you
perfectly
welcome
to
stay
on
here
and
pay
me
when
you
can
sure
that
one
day
with
so
clever
a
young
man
that
awfully
good
of
you
brockett
but
of
course
i
hear
of
anything
like
for
the
third
time
that
evening
he
had
to
fight
against
a
disposition
to
blow
his
nose
and
be
absurd
they
were
both
of
them
increasingly
grim
with
every
word
that
they
spoke
and
any
outside
observer
would
have
supposed
that
they
were
the
deadliest
of
enemies
of
course
she
began
again
there
a
room
that
i
could
let
you
have
at
the
back
of
the
house
that
only
four
shillings
a
week
and
really
you
be
doing
me
a
kindness
in
taking
it
off
my
hands
i
sure
no
there
more
in
it
than
that
he
answered
i
got
to
go
away
right
away
it
time
i
had
a
change
of
scene
it
good
for
me
to
get
along
a
bit
by
myself
you
all
been
too
kind
to
me
spoilt
me
she
stood
up
and
faced
him
sternly
in
all
my
years
she
said
never
spoilt
anybody
yet
and
i
not
likely
to
be
going
to
begin
now
spoilt
you
bah
she
almost
snorted
at
him
but
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
i
not
a
philanthropist
she
went
on
more
dryly
than
ever
but
i
like
to
have
you
about
the
house
you
keep
the
lodgers
contented
and
the
babies
quiet
i
sure
and
the
little
break
in
her
voice
was
the
first
sign
of
submission
that
we
been
very
good
friends
these
seven
years
and
it
is
everywhere
that
one
can
pick
up
friends
for
the
asking
you
been
splendid
to
me
he
answered
but
it
is
as
though
i
were
going
away
altogether
you
see
me
back
in
a
week
or
two
and
and
i
say
i
shall
make
a
fool
of
myself
if
i
go
on
talking
like
this
he
suddenly
gripped
her
hand
and
wrung
it
again
and
again
then
he
burst
away
from
her
leaving
her
standing
there
in
the
middle
of
the
room
the
old
black
bag
was
very
soon
packed
his
possessions
had
not
greatly
increased
during
these
seven
years
and
soon
he
was
creeping
down
the
stairs
softly
so
that
no
one
should
hear
the
hall
was
empty
he
gave
it
one
last
friendly
look
the
door
had
closed
behind
him
and
he
was
in
the
street
ii
in
its
exuberance
and
high
spirits
and
general
lack
of
london
was
similar
to
a
small
child
taken
to
the
drury
lane
pantomime
for
the
first
time
of
the
numbers
of
young
men
who
with
hats
on
the
back
of
their
heads
passed
down
the
main
thoroughfares
announcing
it
as
their
definite
opinion
that
britons
never
shall
be
slaves
of
the
numbers
of
young
women
who
armed
with
feathers
and
the
sharpest
of
tongues
showed
conclusively
the
superiority
of
their
sex
and
personal
attractions
of
the
numbers
of
old
men
and
old
women
who
had
no
right
whatever
to
be
out
on
a
night
like
this
but
could
help
themselves
and
enjoyed
it
just
as
much
as
their
sons
and
daughters
did
there
is
here
no
room
to
tell
the
houses
were
ablaze
with
light
the
very
seemed
to
rock
up
and
down
with
delight
at
the
spirit
of
the
whole
affair
and
the
feast
of
the
glorification
of
the
bomb
that
did
come
off
was
being
celebrated
with
all
the
honours
peter
was
very
soon
in
the
thick
of
it
the
grey
silences
of
bennett
square
and
bloomsbury
were
left
behind
and
with
them
the
emotions
of
those
tender
partings
after
all
it
would
only
be
a
very
few
weeks
before
he
would
be
back
again
among
them
all
telling
them
of
his
success
on
some
paper
and
going
back
perhaps
to
live
with
them
all
when
his
income
was
assured
and
anyhow
here
he
was
out
to
seek
his
fortune
and
with
stephen
to
help
him
he
battled
with
the
crowd
dragging
the
black
bag
with
him
and
shouting
sometimes
in
sheer
excitement
and
good
spirits
young
women
tickled
him
with
feathers
once
some
one
linked
arms
with
him
and
dragged
him
along
always
he
was
surrounded
with
this
sea
of
shouting
exultant
humanity
this
was
life
by
the
lion
stephen
was
waiting
for
him
standing
huge
and
solemn
as
the
crowd
surged
past
he
pressed
peter
arm
to
show
that
he
was
pleased
to
see
him
and
then
without
speaking
they
pushed
through
past
charing
cross
station
and
down
the
hill
to
the
underground
here
once
again
there
was
startling
silence
no
one
seemed
to
be
using
the
trains
at
all
i
afraid
it
ai
much
of
a
place
that
i
taking
yer
to
stephen
said
we
ca
pick
and
choose
yer
know
and
i
was
there
before
and
she
a
good
a
chill
seemed
to
come
with
them
into
the
carriage
suddenly
to
peter
the
comforts
of
brockett
stretched
out
alluring
arms
then
he
pulled
himself
together
i
sure
it
will
be
splendid
he
said
and
it
will
be
just
lovely
being
with
you
after
all
this
they
got
out
and
plunged
into
a
city
of
black
night
around
them
on
every
side
there
was
silence
even
the
broad
central
thoroughfare
seemed
to
be
deserted
and
on
either
side
of
it
to
right
and
left
black
grim
roads
like
open
mouths
lay
waiting
for
the
unwary
traveller
down
one
of
these
they
plunged
peter
was
conscious
of
faces
watching
them
bucket
lane
was
the
street
title
to
fame
windows
showed
dim
candles
in
the
distance
a
sharp
cry
broke
the
silence
and
then
fell
away
again
the
street
was
very
narrow
and
from
the
running
gutters
there
stole
into
the
air
the
odour
of
stale
cabbage
this
is
the
stephen
stopped
somewhere
above
their
heads
a
child
was
crying
chapter
vi
the
world
and
bucket
lane
i
a
light
flashed
in
the
upper
windows
stayed
for
a
moment
and
disappeared
there
was
a
pause
and
then
the
door
slowly
opened
and
a
woman
head
protruded
she
stared
at
them
without
speaking
mr
brant
stephen
said
i
come
back
williams
you
might
that
same
room
me
and
my
friend
might
use
if
it
she
stepped
forward
then
and
looked
at
them
more
carefully
she
was
a
stout
woman
her
hair
hanging
about
her
face
her
dirty
bodice
drawn
tightly
over
her
enormous
bosom
and
her
skirt
pulled
up
in
front
and
hanging
draggled
behind
her
her
long
dirty
fingers
went
up
to
her
face
continually
she
had
a
way
of
pushing
at
her
teeth
with
them
she
seemed
however
pleased
to
see
stephen
well
brant
she
said
come
in
it
a
surprise
i
must
say
but
lord
as
i
always
telling
griggs
oo
on
the
bottom
floor
when
she
can
afford
rent
which
been
often
lately
poor
thing
owing
to
tenth
only
three
weeks
back
quite
unexpected
and
man
being
turned
off
business
what
been
at
this
ten
year
and
more
well
come
along
in
i
sure
they
in
by
this
time
having
been
urged
by
their
hostess
into
the
very
narrowest
darkest
and
smelliest
passage
that
peter
had
ever
encountered
somewhere
behind
the
walls
the
world
was
moving
on
every
side
of
him
above
and
below
children
were
crying
voices
swearing
murmuring
complaining
arguing
peter
could
feel
williams
breath
hot
against
his
cheek
up
the
wheezy
stairs
she
panted
they
following
her
peter
had
never
heard
such
loquacity
it
poured
from
her
as
though
she
meant
nothing
whatever
by
it
and
was
scarcely
aware
indeed
of
the
things
that
she
was
saying
and
it
a
long
time
brant
since
we
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
my
last
left
me
since
yer
was
indeed
all
along
of
a
fight
with
old
colly
moles
down
three
barrer
walk
penal
servitude
poor
feller
and
all
along
of
nasty
temper
as
i
was
always
tellin
why
the
very
morning
before
it
i
remember
sayin
to
when
up
and
threw
a
knife
at
me
for
contradictin
words
i
remember
sayin
to
that
temper
would
be
the
settlin
of
me
but
would
listen
not
obstinate
lord
that
simply
is
the
word
for
it
but
the
room
and
nobody
been
in
it
since
sairy
grace
and
she
was
always
men
along
with
dirty
slut
and
that
a
month
since
she
been
and
gone
and
i
always
like
yer
brant
for
you
quiet
enough
and
no
trouble
at
all
and
your
friend
looks
pleasant
i
must
the
room
was
indeed
remarkably
respectable
not
blessed
with
much
furniture
in
addition
to
two
beds
and
two
chairs
but
roomy
and
with
a
large
and
moderately
clean
window
now
what
about
terms
for
me
and
my
friend
said
stephen
now
followed
friendly
argument
in
which
the
lady
and
stephen
seemed
perfectly
to
understand
one
another
after
asserting
that
under
no
circumstances
whatever
could
she
possibly
take
less
than
at
least
double
the
price
that
stephen
offered
her
she
suddenly
at
the
sound
of
a
child
shrill
crying
from
below
shrugged
her
shoulders
with
young
anne
again
well
brant
it
your
own
way
contented
enough
i
sure
and
vanished
but
the
little
discussion
had
brought
peter
to
a
sharp
realisation
of
the
immediate
business
of
ways
and
means
sitting
on
one
of
the
beds
afterwards
with
stephen
beside
him
he
inquired
how
much
have
we
got
stephen
i
got
thirty
never
you
mind
peter
we
soon
be
gettin
why
of
course
i
force
to
take
me
that
all
you
want
in
these
things
to
look
fierce
and
say
you
wo
go
until
they
give
you
something
a
trial
and
sitting
there
on
the
bed
with
stephen
beside
him
he
felt
immensely
confident
there
was
nothing
that
he
could
not
do
with
one
swift
movement
he
seemed
to
have
flung
from
him
all
the
things
that
were
beginning
to
crowd
in
between
him
and
his
work
he
must
never
never
allow
that
to
happen
again
how
could
one
ever
be
expected
to
work
if
one
were
always
thinking
of
other
people
interested
in
them
and
their
doings
involved
with
anarchists
and
bombs
and
romantic
adventures
why
here
he
was
with
nothing
in
the
world
to
hold
him
or
to
interfere
and
no
one
except
dear
old
stephen
with
whom
he
must
talk
ambition
crept
very
close
to
him
that
night
ambition
with
its
glittering
shining
rewards
its
music
and
colours
close
to
him
as
he
sat
in
that
bare
naked
room
i
rather
be
with
you
than
any
one
in
the
world
we
have
such
times
you
and
perhaps
stephen
knew
more
about
the
world
perhaps
during
the
years
that
he
had
been
tumbled
and
knocked
about
he
had
realised
that
the
world
was
no
easy
nut
to
crack
and
that
loaves
and
fishes
do
come
to
the
hungry
for
the
asking
but
peter
that
night
was
to
be
appalled
by
nothing
they
sat
up
into
the
early
morning
talking
the
noises
in
the
house
and
in
the
streets
about
them
rose
and
fell
some
distant
cry
would
climb
into
the
silence
and
draw
from
it
other
cries
set
like
notes
of
music
to
tumble
back
into
a
common
scheme
together
steve
tell
me
about
zanti
is
he
really
a
scoundrel
a
scoundrel
no
poor
feller
why
peter
you
ought
to
know
better
than
that
ai
got
a
spark
of
malice
in
him
but
always
after
adventure
knows
all
the
queer
people
in
europe
and
europe
too
there
nothin
do
put
nose
into
in
a
clumsy
childish
way
but
always
you
understand
peter
because
after
romantic
fancies
it
was
when
was
after
gold
down
in
cornwall
some
old
treasure
story
that
i
came
across
and
was
kind
to
me
was
a
man
zanti
and
never
meant
to
a
soul
and
very
fond
of
you
yes
i
peter
was
vaguely
troubled
i
hope
i
have
been
unkind
about
him
i
suppose
it
was
the
shock
of
the
whole
thing
but
it
was
time
i
went
anyway
but
tell
me
stephen
what
you
been
doing
all
these
years
and
why
you
let
me
be
all
that
time
without
seeing
you
well
peter
i
did
think
it
would
be
good
for
you
i
was
knowing
lots
o
strange
people
time
and
again
and
then
you
might
have
been
mixed
up
with
me
i
safe
enough
now
i
thinking
and
i
have
been
safe
enough
all
the
time
the
way
cornwall
was
then
and
every
one
sympathising
with
me
but
what
have
you
been
doing
all
the
time
i
was
in
america
a
bit
and
there
are
few
things
i
have
worked
at
in
my
time
always
waiting
for
to
come
and
she
will
come
some
time
it
only
patience
that
have
you
ever
heard
from
her
there
was
a
line
once
just
a
line
all
his
great
body
seemed
to
glow
with
confidence
peter
would
like
then
to
have
spoken
about
clare
rossiter
but
no
some
shyness
held
him
one
day
he
would
tell
stephen
he
unpacked
his
few
possessions
carefully
and
then
on
a
very
hard
bed
dreaming
of
bombs
of
brockett
dressed
as
a
ballet
dancer
of
zanti
digging
for
treasure
beneath
the
grey
flags
of
bennett
square
of
clare
elizabeth
rossiter
riding
down
oxford
street
amidst
the
shouts
of
the
populace
of
the
world
as
a
coloured
globe
on
which
he
peter
westcott
the
author
of
that
masterpiece
reuben
hallard
had
set
his
foot
so
triumphant
he
slept
ii
on
the
next
morning
the
attack
on
london
began
the
house
in
bucket
lane
was
dark
and
grim
when
he
left
it
the
street
was
hidden
from
the
light
and
hung
like
a
strip
of
black
ribbon
between
the
sunshine
of
the
broader
highways
that
lay
at
each
end
of
it
it
was
a
jewish
in
yiddish
were
in
all
the
little
grimy
shop
windows
in
the
bakers
and
the
sweetshops
and
the
laundries
but
it
was
not
this
bucket
lane
a
street
without
its
dignity
and
its
own
personal
little
cleanliness
it
had
its
attempts
at
such
things
his
own
room
and
williams
tea
and
bread
and
butter
had
been
clean
but
as
he
came
down
out
of
these
strange
murmuring
places
with
their
sense
of
hiding
from
the
world
at
large
the
things
that
they
were
occupied
in
doing
bucket
lane
stuck
in
his
head
as
a
dark
little
quarry
into
which
he
must
at
the
day
end
whatever
gorgeous
places
he
had
meanwhile
encountered
creep
creeping
was
the
only
way
to
get
into
such
a
place
meanwhile
he
had
put
on
his
best
had
blackened
his
shoes
until
they
shone
like
little
mirrors
had
brushed
his
bowler
hat
again
and
again
and
looked
finally
like
a
sailor
on
shore
for
a
holiday
seven
years
in
charing
cross
road
had
not
taken
the
brown
from
his
cheeks
nor
bent
his
broad
shoulders
at
the
mansion
house
he
climbed
on
to
the
top
of
a
lumbering
omnibus
and
sailed
down
through
the
city
it
was
now
that
he
discovered
how
seldom
during
his
seven
years
he
had
ventured
beyond
his
little
square
of
country
below
him
on
either
side
of
him
black
swarms
stirred
and
moved
now
forming
ahead
of
him
patterns
squares
circles
then
suddenly
rising
it
appeared
like
insects
and
in
a
cloud
surging
against
the
high
stone
buildings
all
men
men
moving
with
eyes
straight
ahead
of
them
bent
furiously
upon
some
business
but
assembling
retreating
advancing
it
seemed
by
the
order
of
some
giant
hand
that
in
the
air
above
them
played
a
game
imagine
that
in
some
moment
of
boredom
the
hand
were
to
brush
the
little
pieces
aside
were
to
close
the
board
and
put
it
away
then
with
what
ignominy
and
feeble
helplessness
would
these
little
black
figures
topple
clumsily
into
heaps
down
through
the
midst
of
them
the
omnibus
like
a
man
with
an
impediment
in
his
speech
surrounded
by
the
chatter
of
cabs
and
carts
and
bicycles
stammered
its
way
the
streets
opened
and
shut
shouts
came
up
to
them
and
fell
away
peter
heart
danced
london
was
here
at
last
and
the
silence
of
bennett
square
the
dark
omens
of
bucket
lane
and
the
clamour
of
the
city
had
together
been
the
key
for
the
unlocking
of
its
gates
ludgate
hill
caught
them
into
its
heart
held
them
for
an
instant
and
then
flung
them
down
in
the
confusion
of
fleet
street
here
it
was
at
last
then
with
its
typewriters
and
its
telephones
and
its
printing
machines
hurling
with
a
whir
and
clatter
the
news
of
the
world
into
the
air
and
above
it
brooding
like
an
immense
brain
the
god
of
its
restless
activity
the
dome
of
paul
peter
climbed
down
from
his
omnibus
because
he
saw
on
his
right
a
public
reading
room
here
in
tattered
and
anxious
company
he
studied
the
papers
and
took
down
addresses
in
a
note
book
he
was
frightened
for
an
instant
by
the
feet
that
shuffled
up
and
down
the
floor
from
paper
to
paper
there
was
something
most
hopeless
in
the
sound
of
that
shuffle
yer
a
cigarette
on
yer
mister
that
yer
would
mind
he
turned
round
and
at
once
like
blows
two
fierce
gaunt
eyes
struck
him
in
the
face
two
eyes
staring
from
some
dirty
brown
pieces
of
cloth
on
end
it
seemed
by
reason
of
their
own
pathetic
striving
for
notice
rather
than
because
of
any
life
inside
them
peter
murmured
something
and
hurried
away
supposing
that
editors
but
no
this
was
not
the
proper
beginning
of
a
successful
day
but
the
place
down
steps
under
the
earth
with
its
miserable
shadows
was
not
pleasant
to
remember
his
first
visit
was
to
the
office
of
morning
he
remembered
his
remark
to
stephen
about
but
his
heart
sank
as
he
entered
the
large
high
room
with
its
railed
counter
running
round
the
centre
of
it
a
barrier
cold
impassable
already
several
people
were
sitting
on
chairs
that
were
ranged
along
the
wall
peter
went
up
boldly
to
the
counter
and
a
very
thin
young
man
with
a
stone
hatchet
instead
of
a
face
and
his
hair
very
wonderfully
parted
in
the
middle
so
accurately
parted
that
peter
could
think
of
nothing
else
watched
him
coldly
over
the
barrier
what
can
i
do
for
you
he
said
i
want
to
see
the
have
you
an
appointment
oh
i
afraid
that
it
would
be
impossible
without
an
is
there
any
one
whom
i
could
see
if
you
could
tell
me
your
business
perhaps
peter
began
to
be
infuriated
with
this
young
man
with
the
hatchet
face
i
want
to
know
if
there
any
place
for
me
on
this
paper
if
i
can
oh
the
voice
was
very
cold
indeed
and
the
iron
barrier
seemed
to
multiply
itself
over
and
over
again
all
round
the
room
i
afraid
in
that
case
you
had
better
write
to
the
editor
and
make
an
appointment
no
i
afraid
there
is
no
one
peter
melted
away
the
faces
on
the
chairs
were
all
very
glad
the
stone
building
echoed
with
some
voice
that
called
some
one
a
long
way
away
peter
was
in
the
street
he
stood
outside
the
great
offices
of
morning
and
looked
across
the
valley
at
the
great
dome
that
squatted
above
the
moving
threads
of
living
figures
he
was
absurdly
upset
by
this
unfortunate
interview
what
could
he
have
expected
of
what
use
was
it
that
he
should
fling
his
insignificance
against
that
kind
of
wall
moreover
he
must
try
many
times
before
his
chance
would
be
given
him
it
was
absurd
that
he
should
mind
that
rebuff
but
the
young
man
pursued
him
he
seemed
to
see
now
as
he
looked
up
and
down
the
street
a
hostility
in
the
faces
of
those
that
passed
him
moreover
he
saw
here
and
there
figures
wretched
figures
moving
in
and
out
of
the
crowd
bending
into
the
gutter
for
something
that
had
been
dropped
lean
haggard
faces
burning
eyes
he
began
to
see
them
as
a
chain
that
wound
up
and
down
amongst
the
people
and
the
carriages
along
the
street
he
pulled
himself
together
if
he
was
feeling
these
things
at
the
very
beginning
of
his
battle
why
then
defeat
was
certain
he
was
ashamed
and
looking
at
his
paper
chose
the
offices
of
a
very
popular
society
journal
that
brightened
the
world
with
its
cheerful
smile
every
friday
morning
here
the
room
in
which
he
found
himself
was
small
and
cosy
it
had
a
bright
pink
and
behind
a
little
shining
table
a
shining
young
woman
beamed
upon
him
the
shining
young
woman
was
however
very
busy
at
her
typewriter
and
peter
was
examined
by
a
tiny
office
boy
who
seemed
to
be
made
entirely
of
shining
brass
buttons
and
shining
little
boots
and
shining
hair
and
what
can
i
do
for
you
sir
he
said
i
should
like
to
see
the
editor
peter
explained
your
name
said
the
shining
one
peter
had
no
cards
he
blamed
himself
for
the
omission
and
stammered
in
his
reply
the
boy
gave
the
lady
at
the
typewriter
a
very
knowing
look
and
disappeared
he
swiftly
returned
and
said
that
boset
could
see
westcott
for
a
few
minutes
but
for
a
few
minutes
only
boset
sat
resplendent
in
a
room
that
was
coloured
a
bright
green
he
was
himself
stout
and
and
of
a
surpassing
smartness
his
light
blue
suit
was
very
tight
at
the
waist
and
very
broad
over
the
hips
his
white
spats
gleamed
his
pearl
pin
stared
like
an
eye
across
the
room
his
neck
bulged
in
red
folds
over
his
collar
boset
was
eating
chocolates
out
of
a
little
cardboard
box
and
his
attention
was
continually
held
by
the
telephone
that
summoned
him
to
its
side
at
frequent
intervals
he
was
however
exceedingly
pleasant
he
begged
peter
to
take
a
chair
just
a
minute

strand
peter
found
himself
once
more
in
the
outer
room
and
then
ushered
forth
by
the
shining
boy
he
was
in
the
street
he
was
hungry
now
and
sought
an
shop
and
there
over
the
cold
tables
consulted
his
list
the
next
attempt
should
be
saturday
one
of
the
leading
illustrated
weeklies
and
perhaps
there
he
would
be
more
successful
as
he
sat
in
the
shop
and
watched
the
squares
of
street
opposite
the
window
he
felt
suddenly
that
no
effort
of
his
would
enable
him
to
struggle
successfully
against
those
indifferent
crowds
above
the
houses
in
the
patch
of
blue
sky
that
filled
the
soft
bundles
of
cloud
streamed
like
flags
before
the
wind
into
these
soft
grey
meshes
the
sun
was
swept
and
with
a
cold
shudder
fleet
street
fell
into
shadow
beyond
it
and
above
it
the
great
dome
burned
a
company
of
sandwich
men
advertising
on
their
stooping
bodies
the
latest
musical
comedy
crept
along
the
gutter
iii
at
the
offices
of
saturday
they
told
him
that
if
he
returned
at
four
he
would
be
able
to
see
the
editor
he
walked
about
and
at
last
sat
down
on
the
embankment
and
watched
the
barges
slide
down
the
river
the
water
was
feathery
and
sometimes
streamed
into
lines
like
spun
silk
reflecting
many
colours
and
above
the
water
the
clouds
turned
and
wheeled
and
changed
against
the
limpid
blue
the
little
slap
that
the
motion
of
the
river
gave
to
the
stone
embankment
reminded
him
of
the
wooden
jetty
at
treliss
the
place
was
strangely
sweet
the
roar
of
the
strand
was
far
away
and
muffled
as
he
sat
there
listening
there
seemed
to
come
up
to
him
straight
out
of
the
river
strange
impersonal
noises
that
had
to
do
with
no
definite
sounds
he
was
reminded
of
a
story
that
he
had
once
read
a
story
concerning
a
nice
young
man
who
caught
the
disease
known
as
the
horror
of
london
peter
thought
that
in
the
air
coming
from
nowhere
intangible
floating
between
the
river
and
the
sky
something
stirred
big
ben
struck
quarter
to
four
and
he
turned
once
more
into
the
strand
the
editor
of
saturday
was
a
very
different
person
from
boset
at
a
desk
piled
with
papers
stern
gaunt
and
his
words
rattled
out
of
his
mouth
like
peas
onto
a
plate
but
peter
saw
that
he
had
humorous
twinkling
eyes
well
what
can
you
do
i
never
tried
anything
but
i
feel
that
i
should
learn
learn
do
you
suppose
this
office
is
a
nursery
shop
for
teaching
sucklings
how
to
draw
their
milk
are
you
ready
for
anything
anything
yes
they
all
say
that
journalism
is
any
fun
you
i
not
looking
for
well
it
the
damnedest
trade
out
anything
better
but
you
want
to
write
i
yes
exactly
well
i
like
the
look
of
you
more
blood
and
bones
than
most
of
the
rotten
puppies
that
come
into
this
office
i
no
job
for
you
at
the
moment
though
go
back
to
your
digs
and
write
something
anything
you
like
and
send
it
along
leave
me
your
address
oh
ho
bucket
lane
hard
up
i
all
right
thank
all
right
i
was
offering
you
charity
no
need
to
put
your
pride
up
i
sha
forget
you
but
send
me
the
clouds
had
now
enveloped
the
sun
as
peter
a
little
encouraged
by
this
last
experience
but
tired
with
a
dull
listless
fatigue
crept
into
the
dark
channels
of
bucket
lane
the
rain
began
to
fall
with
heavy
solemn
drops
chapter
vii
devil
march
i
there
could
be
nothing
odder
than
the
picture
that
brockett
and
bennett
square
presented
from
the
vantage
ground
of
bucket
lane
how
peaceful
and
happy
those
evenings
once
considered
a
little
dreary
perhaps
and
monotonous
now
seemed
those
mornings
in
the
dusty
bookshop
zanti
herr
gottfried
brockett
then
brockett
with
its
strange
company
the
the
marble
pillars
the
green
curtains
norah
monogue
not
only
did
it
seem
another
lifetime
when
he
had
been
there
but
also
inevitably
one
was
threatened
with
never
getting
back
bucket
lane
was
another
world
from
its
grimy
windows
one
looked
upon
every
tragedy
that
life
had
to
offer
into
its
back
courts
were
born
muddled
indecent
little
lives
there
blindly
to
wallow
until
the
earth
called
them
back
to
itself
again
but
it
was
in
the
attitude
of
bucket
lane
to
the
great
inevitable
that
the
essential
difference
was
to
be
observed
in
bennett
square
things
had
been
expected
and
for
the
most
part
obtained
catastrophes
came
lumbering
into
their
midst
at
times
but
rising
in
the
morning
one
might
decently
expect
to
go
to
rest
at
night
in
safety
in
bucket
lane
there
was
no
safety
but
defiance
fierce
bitterly
humorous
truculent
defiance
bucket
lane
was
a
beleaguered
army
that
stood
behind
the
grime
and
dirty
walls
on
guard
from
the
earliest
moment
there
the
faces
of
all
the
babies
born
into
bucket
lane
caught
the
strain
of
cautious
resistance
that
was
always
to
remain
with
them
life
in
bucket
lane
for
every
one
from
the
youngest
infant
to
the
oldest
idiot
was
war
war
against
order
and
civilised
force
war
also
against
that
great
unseen
hand
that
might
at
any
moment
swoop
down
upon
any
one
of
them
and
bestow
fire
death
and
imprisonment
upon
its
victims
to
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
from
the
mission
the
citizens
of
bucket
lane
presented
an
amused
and
cynical
tolerance
if
those
poor
meek
frightened
creatures
chose
some
attempts
at
flattery
and
submission
before
this
abominable
deity
well
they
did
no
harm

said
to
miss
connacher
a
young
woman
from
matthew
mission
and
i
sure
we
always
delighted
to
see
you
miss
but
you
ca
us

and
being
grateful
on
our
bended
knees
to
the
sort
of
person
as
according
to
your
account

it
gave
me
my
first
was
a
blackguard
if
ever
there
was
one
and
my
last
child
wot
rickets
and
so
arranged
me
to
go
breakin
my
leg
one
night
coming
back
from
a
party
and
sliding
on
the
stairs
and
in
losin
my
little
bit
o
charin
and
as
near
the
workus
as
ever
yer
see
no
it
ai
common
to
which
miss
connacher
vaguely
looking
around
for
a
list
of
williams
blessings
and
finding
none
to
speak
of
had
no
reply
but
the
astonishing
thing
was
that
peter
seemed
at
once
to
be
seized
with
the
bucket
lane
position
he
was
now
he
understood
in
a
world
of
earthquake
wise
citizens
lived
from
minute
to
minute
and
counted
on
no
longer
safety
he
began
also
to
eliminate
everything
that
was
not
absolutely
essential
at
brockett
he
had
never
consciously
done
without
anything
that
he
wanted
in
bucket
lane
he
discarded
to
the
last
possible
shred
of
possession
he
had
returned
from
his
first
day
hunting
with
the
resolve
that
before
he
ventured
out
again
he
would
have
something
to
show
with
a
precious
sixpence
he
bought
a
copy
of
and
studied
it
there
was
a
short
story
entitled
mrs
adair
and
an
article
on
what
society
drinks
the
remaining
pages
of
the
number
were
filled
with
pictures
and
chatter
from
day
to
this
production
lying
on
one
of
the
beds
in
the
dark
room
in
bucket
lane
seemed
singularly
out
of
place
its
pages
fluttered
in
the
breeze
that
came
through
the
window

a
very
favourite
place
for
supper
just
now
with
maitre
savori
as
its
popular
chef
and
its
admirably
stocked
cellars
peter
gave
himself
a
fortnight
in
which
to
produce
something
that
he
could
stephen
meanwhile
had
found
work
as
a
waiter
in
one
of
the
small
soho
restaurants
it
was
only
a
temporary
engagement
but
he
hoped
to
get
something
better
within
a
week
or
two
for
the
moment
all
was
well
at
the
end
of
his
fortnight
with
four
things
written
peter
meant
to
advance
once
more
to
the
attack
meanwhile
he
sat
with
a
pen
a
penny
bottle
of
ink
and
an
exercise
book
and
did
what
he
could
at
the
end
of
the
fortnight
he
had
written
the
sea
road
an
essay
for
which
robert
louis
stevenson
was
largely
responsible
the
redgate
mill
a
story
of
the
fantastic
terrible
kind
stones
for
bread
moralising
on
bucket
lane
and
the
boy
a
somewhat
bitter
reminiscence
of
dawson
of
this
the
best
was
undoubtedly
the
sea
road
but
in
his
heart
of
hearts
peter
knew
that
there
was
something
the
matter
with
all
of
them
reuben
hallard
he
had
written
because
he
had
to
write
it
these
four
things
he
had
written
because
he
ought
to
write
them
difference
sufficient
nevertheless
he
put
them
into
halfpenny
wrappes
and
sent
them
away
in
the
struggle
to
produce
these
things
he
had
not
found
that
fortnight
wearisome
before
him
every
day
there
was
the
evening
when
stephen
would
return
to
which
he
might
look
forward
stephen
was
always
very
late
often
it
was
two
before
he
came
in
but
they
had
a
talk
before
going
to
sleep
and
here
in
these
evenings
stephen
developed
in
the
most
wonderful
way
developed
because
peter
had
really
never
known
him
before
stephen
had
never
appeared
to
peter
as
a
character
at
all
in
the
early
days
peter
had
been
too
young
stephen
had
at
that
time
been
simply
something
to
be
worshipped
without
any
question
or
statement
now
that
worshipping
had
gone
and
the
space
that
it
left
had
to
be
filled
by
some
new
relationship
something
that
could
only
come
slowly
out
of
the
close
juxtaposition
that
living
together
in
bucket
lane
had
provided
and
it
was
stephen
who
found
unconsciously
and
quite
simply
the
shape
and
colour
of
peter
idea
of
him
peter
had
in
reality
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
it
and
had
stephen
been
a
whit
more
the
effect
would
have
been
spoiled
in
the
first
place
peter
came
quite
freshly
to
the
way
that
stephen
looked
stephen
expressed
nothing
consciously
with
his
body
it
was
wonderful
indeed
considering
its
size
and
strength
the
little
that
he
managed
to
do
with
it
his
eyes
were
mild
and
amiable
his
face
largely
covered
with
a
deep
brown
beard
once
wildly
flowing
now
sharply
pointed
he
was
at
least
six
foot
four
in
height
the
breadth
of
shoulder
was
tremendous
but
although
he
knew
admirably
what
to
do
with
it
as
a
means
of
conveyance
of
sheer
physical
habit
he
had
no
conception
of
the
possibilities
that
it
held
as
the
expression
of
his
soul
that
soul
was
to
be
found
by
those
who
cared
to
look
for
it
glancing
from
his
eyes
struggling
sometimes
through
the
swift
friendliness
of
his
smile
but
he
gave
it
no
invitation
it
all
came
perhaps
from
the
fact
that
he
treated
himself
if
anything
so
unconscious
may
be
called
treatment
as
the
very
simplest
creature
alive
the
word
introspection
meant
nothing
to
him
whatever
there
were
in
life
certain
direct
sharp
motives
and
on
these
he
acted
he
never
thought
of
himself
or
of
any
one
else
in
terms
of
complexity
the
body
acted
simply
through
certain
clear
and
direct
physical
laws
so
the
spirit
he
loved
the
woman
who
had
dominated
his
whole
life
and
one
day
he
would
find
her
and
marry
her
he
loved
peter
as
he
would
love
a
son
of
his
own
if
he
possessed
one
and
he
would
be
at
peter
side
so
long
as
peter
needed
him
and
would
rather
be
there
than
anywhere
else
for
the
rest
life
was
a
matter
of
birth
and
death
of
loving
one
man
and
hating
another
of
food
and
drink
and
but
this
last
uncertainly
of
some
strange
thrill
that
was
stirred
in
him
at
times
by
certain
sights
and
sounds
he
was
glad
to
have
been
born
he
would
be
quite
ready
to
die
he
did
not
question
the
reason
of
the
one
state
or
the
other
for
the
very
fact
that
life
was
so
simple
and
unentangled
he
clung
with
the
tenacity
and
dumb
force
of
an
animal
to
the
things
that
he
had
peter
felt
vaguely
from
time
to
time
the
strength
with
which
stephen
held
to
him
it
was
never
expressed
in
word
nor
in
action
but
it
came
leaping
sometimes
like
fire
into
the
midst
of
their
conversation
it
was
never
tangible
always
illusive
to
peter
progress
this
simplicity
of
stephen
was
of
vast
importance
the
boy
had
now
reached
an
age
and
a
period
where
emotions
judgments
partialities
conclusions
and
surmises
were
fighting
furiously
for
dominion
his
seven
years
at
brockett
had
been
introspectively
of
little
moment
he
had
been
too
busy
discovering
the
things
that
other
people
had
discovered
and
written
down
to
think
very
much
about
himself
now
released
from
the
domination
of
books
he
plunged
into
a
whirlpool
of
surmise
about
himself
during
the
fortnight
that
he
sat
writing
his
articles
in
bucket
lane
he
flew
he
sank
according
to
his
moods
it
seemed
to
him
that
as
soon
as
he
had
decided
on
one
path
and
set
out
eagerly
to
follow
it
others
crossed
it
and
bewildered
him
he
was
now
on
that
unwholesome
absorbing
thrilling
dangerous
path
of
opposed
to
this
was
the
inarticulate
friendly
soul
of
stephen
stephen
understood
nothing
and
at
the
same
time
understood
everything
against
the
testing
of
his
few
simple
laws
complexities
often
vanished
but
vanished
only
to
recur
again
unsatisfied
demanding
a
subtler
answer
it
was
during
those
days
through
all
the
trouble
and
even
horror
that
so
shortly
came
upon
them
both
that
stephen
realised
with
a
dull
unreasoned
pain
like
lead
at
the
heart
that
peter
was
passing
inevitably
from
him
into
a
country
whither
stephen
could
not
follow
to
deal
with
issues
that
stephen
could
not
in
any
kind
of
way
understand
stephen
realised
this
many
days
before
peter
even
dimly
perceived
it
and
the
older
man
by
the
love
that
he
had
for
the
boy
whom
he
had
known
from
the
very
first
period
of
his
growth
was
enabled
although
dimly
to
see
beyond
above
all
these
complexities
to
a
day
when
peter
would
once
more
having
learnt
and
suffered
much
in
the
meanwhile
come
back
to
that
first
simplicity
but
that
day
was
far
distant
ii
on
the
evening
of
the
day
on
which
peter
finished
the
last
of
his
five
attempts
to
take
the
london
journals
by
storm
stephen
returned
from
his
restaurant
earlier
than
usual
so
early
indeed
that
peter
had
he
not
been
so
bent
on
his
own
immediate
affairs
must
have
noticed
and
questioned
it
he
might
too
have
observed
that
stephen
now
and
again
shot
an
anxious
troubled
glance
at
him
as
though
he
were
uneasy
about
something
but
peter
since
six
that
evening
at
which
moment
he
had
written
the
concluding
sentence
of
the
sea
road
had
been
in
deep
and
troubled
thought
concerning
himself
and
broke
from
that
introspection
on
stephen
arrival
in
a
state
of
unhappy
morbidity
and
entire
their
supper
was
beer
sardines
and
cheese
it
been
pretty
awful
here
this
evening
peter
said
old
trubbit
on
the
floor
below
been
beating
his
wife
and
she
been
screaming
like
anything
i
could
stand
it
after
a
bit
and
went
down
to
see
what
i
could
do
the
family
was
mopping
her
head
with
water
and
he
was
sitting
on
a
chair
crying
drunk
again
of
course
but
he
was
turned
off
his
job
apparently
this
afternoon
they
closing
luck
said
stephen
looking
at
the
floor
yes
it
has
been
altogether
cheerful
and
his
getting
the
chuck
like
that
set
me
thinking
it
awfully
lucky
you
got
your
job
all
right
and
of
course
now
i
written
these
things
and
have
got
to
show
i
be
all
peter
paused
for
a
moment
a
little
uncertainly
but
it
does
you
know
make
one
a
bit
frightened
this
place
seeing
the
way
people
get
suddenly
bowled
over
there
were
the
gambits
a
fortnight
ago
he
was
in
work
and
they
were
as
fit
as
anything
they
have
had
any
food
now
for
three
there
ai
anything
to
be
frightened
about
stephen
said
slowly
no
i
know
but
stephen
suppose
i
get
work
after
all
been
so
confident
all
this
time
but
i
might
be
able
to
do
the
job
a
bit
i
suppose
this
place
is
getting
on
my
nerves
but
i
could
get
awfully
frightened
if
i
let
oh
you
be
all
right
of
course
you
be
getting
something
yes
but
i
hate
spending
your
money
like
this
do
you
know
stephen
i
almost
rather
you
were
out
of
work
too
that
sounds
a
rotten
thing
to
say
but
i
hate
being
given
it
all
like
this
especially
when
you
have
got
much
of
your
own
either
between
friends
said
stephen
slowly
swinging
his
leg
backwards
and
forwards
and
making
the
bed
creak
under
his
weight
there
are
any
giving
or
taking
it
just
oh
yes
i
know
said
peter
hurriedly
frightened
lest
he
should
have
hurt
his
feelings
of
course
it
all
right
between
you
and
me
but
all
the
same
i
rather
eager
to
be
earning
part
of
they
were
silent
for
a
time
bucket
lane
too
seemed
silent
and
through
their
little
window
between
the
black
roofs
and
chimneys
a
cluster
of
stars
twinkled
as
though
they
had
found
their
way
by
accident
into
a
very
dirty
neighbourhood
and
were
trying
to
get
out
of
it
again
peter
was
busy
fishing
for
his
thoughts
at
last
he
caught
one
and
held
it
out
to
stephen
innocent
gaze
it
is
he
said
like
anything
so
much
as
catching
a
disease
from
an
infectious
neighbourhood
i
think
if
i
lived
here
with
five
thousand
a
year
i
should
still
be
frightened
it
in
the
being
frightened
said
stephen
rather
hurriedly
and
speaking
with
a
kind
of
shame
as
though
he
had
done
something
to
which
he
would
rather
not
own
up
is
a
kind
of
very
soon
peter
you
know
what
like
and
take
it
as
it
oh
said
peter
if
it
that
kind
of
being
frightened
seeing
i
mean
quite
clearly
the
things
you
frightened
of
why
that
pretty
easy
one
of
the
first
books
i
ever
read
lessingham
by
galleon
you
know
i
talked
about
him
to
you
had
a
long
bit
about
it
courage
i
mean
he
made
it
a
kind
of
parable
countries
you
got
to
go
through
before
you
learnt
to
be
really
brave
and
the
first
and
by
far
the
easiest
courage
is
the
sort
that
you
want
when
you
have
got
things
the
sort
the
gambits
want
when
you
starving
or
out
of
a
job
well
that
i
suppose
the
easiest
kind
and
yet
i
funking
it
so
what
on
earth
am
i
going
to
do
when
the
harder
business
comes
along
stephen
i
beginning
to
have
a
secret
and
uncomfortable
suspicion
that
your
friend
peter
westcott
is
a
poor
thank
the
lord
said
stephen
furiously
and
kicking
out
with
his
leg
as
though
he
had
got
some
especial
enemy
back
directly
in
front
of
him
that
you
finished
them
damned
articles
you
been
sittin
here
thinkin
and
writin
till
you
given
yerself
blue
devils
too
with
all
them
poor
creatures
hittin
each
other
and
drinkin
i
ought
to
have
left
yer
up
here
so
much
alone
no
you
could
help
it
stephen
it
nothing
to
do
with
you
all
more
than
you
can
manage
and
nobody
in
the
world
can
help
me
seven
years
and
a
bit
now
since
i
left
cornwall
is
it
yes
said
stephen
looking
across
at
him
all
that
time
i
never
had
a
word
nor
a
sign
from
any
one
there
well
you
might
have
thought
that
that
would
be
long
enough
to
break
right
away
from
it
well
it
is
do
you
go
thinking
about
all
that
time
you
cleared
it
right
away
no
i
have
cleared
it
that
just
the
point
i
do
suppose
one
ever
clears
anything
all
the
time
i
was
with
zanti
i
was
reading
so
hard
and
living
so
safely
that
it
was
only
at
moments
when
i
was
alone
that
i
thought
about
treliss
at
all
but
these
last
weeks
it
been
coming
on
me
full
what
been
coming
on
you
well
scaw
house
i
suppose
and
my
father
and
grandfather
my
grandfather
told
me
once
that
i
could
escape
from
the
family
and
i
ca
it
the
most
extraordinary
thing
stephen
saw
that
peter
was
growing
agitated
his
hands
were
clenched
and
his
face
was
white
mind
you
i
seen
my
grandfather
and
father
both
go
under
it
my
father
went
down
all
in
a
moment
it
is
any
one
thing
you
can
call
it
drink
if
you
like
but
it
simply
three
parts
of
us
aching
to
go
to
the
bad
aching
that
the
word
anything
rotten
women
or
drink
or
anything
you
like
as
long
as
we
lose
control
and
let
the
devil
get
the
upper
hand
let
him
get
it
once
get
it
and
we
really
done
peter
paused
for
a
moment
and
then
went
on
hurriedly
as
though
he
were
telling
a
story
and
had
only
a
little
time
in
which
to
tell
it
but
that
is
all
it
worse
than
that
i
been
feeling
these
last
weeks
as
though
my
father
were
sitting
there
in
that
beastly
house
with
that
filthy
woman
and
willing
me
absolutely
with
all
his
might
to
go
under
but
what
is
it
said
stephen
going
as
always
to
the
simplest
aspect
of
the
case
that
you
exactly
want
to
do
oh
i
do
know
just
to
let
loose
the
whole
thing
i
did
break
out
once
at
brockett
i
never
told
anybody
but
i
got
badly
drunk
one
night
and
then
went
back
with
some
woman
oh
it
was
all
filthy
but
i
was
mad
wild
for
hours
insane
and
that
night
in
the
middle
of
it
all
sitting
there
as
plainly
as
you
please
there
in
scaw
house
i
saw
my
father
as
plainly
as
i
see
you
all
young
men
said
stephen
got
to
go
through
a
bit
of
filth
you
are
the
sort
of
fellow
peter
that
stays
there
your
wanting
not
to
shows
that
you
come
out
of
it
all
here
was
a
case
where
stephen
simplicities
were
obviously
of
little
avail
ah
but
do
you
see
said
peter
impatiently
it
not
the
thing
itself
that
i
feel
matters
so
much
although
that
rotten
enough
but
it
the
beastly
devil
real
personal
i
tell
you
i
saw
him
catch
my
grandfather
as
tight
as
though
he
been
there
in
the
room
and
my
father
too
i
tell
you
this
last
week
or
two
i
been
almost
mad
wanting
to
chuck
it
all
this
fighting
and
the
rest
and
just
go
down
and
grovel
i
expect
it
regular
work
you
wanting
said
stephen
keeping
your
mind
busy
it
bad
to
your
sort
of
brain
wandering
round
with
nothing
to
feed
on
it
be
all
right
boy
in
a
day
or
two
when
got
some
peter
head
dropped
forward
on
to
his
hands
i
do
know
like
going
round
in
a
circle
you
see
stephen
what
makes
it
all
so
difficult
is
well
i
do
know
why
i
have
told
you
before
but
the
fact
is
i
in
love
i
knew
it
a
while
back
said
stephen
quietly
watching
your
face
when
you
did
know
i
was
lookin
well
it
all
hopeless
of
course
i
do
suppose
i
shall
ever
see
her
again
but
that
what
made
this
looking
for
work
so
difficult
i
been
wanting
to
get
on
and
every
day
seems
to
place
her
further
away
and
then
when
i
get
hopeless
these
other
devils
come
round
and
say
well
you
ca
get
her
you
know
that
as
impossible
as
anything
so
you
better
have
your
fling
while
you
can
my
god
a
beast
the
cry
broke
from
him
with
a
bitterness
that
filled
the
bare
little
room
stephen
after
a
little
got
up
and
put
his
hand
on
the
boy
shoulder
nobody
ai
going
to
touch
you
while
i
here
he
said
simply
as
though
he
were
challenging
devils
and
men
alike
peter
looked
up
and
smiled
what
an
old
brick
you
are
he
said
do
you
remember
that
fight
christmas
time
years
ago
you
always
like
that
i
been
an
ass
to
bother
you
with
it
all
and
while
got
each
other
things
ca
be
so
he
got
up
and
stretched
his
arms
well
it
bedtime
especially
as
you
got
to
be
off
early
to
that
old
restaurant
stephen
stepped
back
from
him
i
been
meaning
to
tell
you
he
said
that
off
the
place
paying
and
the
boss
shut
four
of
us
down
i
not
to
go
back
peter
boy
he
finished
almost
triumphantly
we
up
against
it
i
got
a
quid
in
my
pocket
and
that
all
there
is
to
they
faced
one
another
whilst
the
candle
behind
them
guttered
and
blew
in
the
window
cracks
and
the
cluster
of
stars
still
caught
in
the
dirty
roofs
and
chimneys
of
bucket
lane
twinkled
desperately
in
vain
chapter
viii
stephen
chapter
i
no
knight
the
hero
of
any
chronicle
ever
went
forward
to
his
battle
with
a
braver
heart
than
did
peter
now
in
his
desperate
adventure
against
the
world
his
morbidity
his
introspection
his
irritation
with
stephen
simplicities
fled
from
him
he
was
gay
filled
with
the
glamour
of
showing
what
one
could
do
he
did
not
doubt
but
that
a
fortnight
would
see
him
in
a
magnificent
position
and
then
the
fortnight
passed
and
he
and
stephen
had
still
their
positions
to
discover
the
money
moreover
was
almost
at
an
end
another
fortnight
would
behold
them
penniless
it
was
absurd
it
was
monstrous
incredible
life
was
not
like
that
peter
bit
his
lip
and
set
out
again
editors
had
not
on
most
occasions
vouchsafed
him
even
an
interview
then
had
come
no
answer
to
the
four
halfpenny
wrappers
the
world
like
a
wall
of
shining
steel
closed
him
in
with
impenetrable
silence
it
was
absurd
it
was
monstrous
peter
fought
desperately
as
a
bird
beats
with
its
wings
on
the
bars
of
its
cage
they
were
having
the
worst
of
luck
on
several
occasions
he
had
been
just
too
late
and
some
one
had
got
the
position
before
him
stephen
too
found
that
the
places
where
he
had
worked
before
had
now
no
job
for
him
it
was
the
worst
time
in
the
world
a
month
ago
now
or
possibly
in
a
month
time
stephen
did
not
tell
the
boy
that
away
from
london
there
were
many
things
that
he
could
do
the
boy
was
not
up
to
tramping
indeed
nothing
was
more
remarkable
than
the
way
in
which
peter
strength
seemed
to
strain
like
a
flood
away
it
was
perhaps
a
matter
of
nerves
as
much
as
physical
strength
the
boy
was
burning
with
the
anxiety
of
it
whereas
to
stephen
this
was
no
new
experience
peter
saw
it
in
the
light
of
some
horrible
disaster
that
belonged
in
all
the
world
history
to
him
alone
he
came
back
at
the
end
of
one
of
his
days
white
his
eyes
almost
closed
his
fingers
twitching
his
head
hanging
a
little
very
silent
he
seemed
to
feel
bitterly
the
ignominy
of
it
as
though
he
were
realising
for
the
first
time
that
nobody
wanted
him
he
had
come
now
to
be
ready
to
do
anything
anything
in
the
world
and
he
had
the
look
of
one
who
was
ready
to
do
anything
his
blue
coat
was
shiny
his
boots
had
been
patched
by
stephen
there
were
deep
black
hollows
under
his
eyes
and
his
mouth
had
become
thin
and
hard
stephen
having
himself
his
own
distresses
to
support
watched
the
boy
with
acute
anxiety
he
felt
with
increasing
unhappiness
that
here
was
an
organism
a
temperament
that
was
new
to
him
that
was
beyond
his
grasp
peter
saw
things
in
it
all
this
position
of
a
desperate
cry
for
work
that
he
stephen
had
never
seen
at
all
peter
would
sit
in
the
evening
in
his
chair
staring
in
front
of
him
silent
and
hearing
nothing
that
stephen
said
to
him
with
stephen
life
was
a
case
of
having
money
or
not
having
it
if
one
had
not
money
one
went
without
everything
possible
and
waited
until
the
money
came
again
the
tide
was
sure
to
turn
but
with
peter
this
was
all
a
fight
against
his
father
who
sat
apparently
in
the
dark
rooms
at
scaw
house
willing
disaster
now
as
stephen
and
all
the
sensible
world
knew
this
was
nonsense
it
was
also
in
some
still
stranger
way
a
fight
against
london
itself
not
london
a
place
of
streets
and
houses
of
oxford
street
and
piccadilly
circus
but
london
an
animal
a
kind
of
dragon
as
far
as
stephen
could
make
it
out
with
scales
and
a
tail
now
what
was
one
to
make
of
this
except
that
the
boy
head
was
being
turned
and
that
he
ought
to
see
a
doctor
there
was
also
the
further
question
of
an
appeal
to
brockett
or
zanti
stephen
knew
that
herr
gottfried
or
zanti
would
lend
help
eagerly
did
they
but
know
and
he
supposed
from
the
things
that
peter
had
told
him
that
there
were
also
warm
friends
at
brockett
but
the
boy
had
made
him
swear
with
the
last
order
of
solemnity
that
he
would
send
no
word
to
either
place
peter
had
said
that
he
would
never
speak
to
him
again
should
he
do
such
a
thing
he
had
said
that
should
he
once
obtain
an
independent
position
then
he
would
go
back
but
not
before
stephen
did
not
know
what
to
do
nor
where
to
go
in
another
month
time
the
rent
could
not
be
paid
and
then
they
must
go
into
the
street
and
peter
was
in
no
condition
for
that
he
should
rather
be
in
bed
williams
it
is
true
would
not
be
hard
upon
them
for
she
was
a
kind
woman
and
had
formed
a
great
liking
for
peter
but
she
had
only
enough
herself
to
keep
her
family
alive
and
she
must
for
her
children
sake
let
the
room
to
stephen
puzzling
in
vain
and
going
round
and
round
in
a
hopeless
circle
it
seemed
as
though
peter
brains
were
locked
in
an
iron
box
and
they
could
not
find
a
key
for
himself
well
it
was
natural
enough
but
peter
with
that
genius
that
no
one
should
want
him
and
yet
through
it
all
at
the
back
of
the
misery
and
distress
of
it
there
was
a
wild
pride
a
fierce
joy
that
he
had
the
key
with
him
that
he
was
all
in
the
world
to
whom
the
boy
might
look
that
to
him
and
to
him
alone
in
this
wild
cold
world
peter
now
belonged
it
was
his
moment
ii
at
the
end
of
a
terrible
day
of
disastrous
rejections
peter
stumbling
down
the
strand
was
conscious
of
a
little
with
a
neat
that
stood
back
from
the
street
at
the
bottom
of
his
trouser
pocket
a
tiny
threepenny
piece
that
stephen
had
that
morning
thrust
upon
him
turned
round
and
round
in
his
fingers
he
had
not
spent
it
he
had
intended
to
restore
it
to
stephen
in
the
evening
he
had
meant
too
to
walk
back
all
the
way
to
bucket
lane
but
now
he
felt
that
he
could
not
do
that
unless
he
were
first
to
take
something
this
little
inn
with
its
down
the
strand
in
the
light
of
the
setting
sun
he
saw
again
that
which
he
had
often
seen
during
these
last
weeks
that
chain
of
gaunt
figures
that
moved
with
bending
backs
and
twisted
fingers
on
and
out
of
the
crowds
and
the
carriages
the
beggars
he
felt
already
that
they
knew
that
he
was
soon
to
be
one
of
their
number
that
every
day
every
hour
brought
him
nearer
to
their
ranks
an
old
man
dirty
in
rags
stepped
with
an
eager
eye
past
him
and
stooped
for
a
moment
into
the
gutter
he
rose
again
slipping
something
into
his
pocket
of
his
tattered
coat
he
gave
peter
a
glance
to
the
boy
it
seemed
a
glance
of
triumphant
recognition
and
then
he
had
slipped
away
peter
had
had
very
little
to
eat
during
these
last
days
and
for
the
first
time
things
began
to
take
an
uncertain
shape
as
he
stood
on
the
kerb
and
looked
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
strand
was
the
at
treliss
that
the
roar
of
the
traffic
was
the
noise
that
the
sea
made
far
below
them
if
one
could
see
round
the
corner
there
where
the
sun
flung
a
patch
of
red
light
one
would
come
upon
scaw
house
in
its
dark
clump
of
trees
and
through
the
window
of
that
front
room
peter
could
see
his
father
and
that
old
woman
one
on
each
side
of
the
drinking
but
the
was
stormy
its
noise
was
loud
in
ears
and
then
the
way
that
people
brushed
against
him
as
they
passed
recalled
him
to
himself
and
he
slipped
back
almost
into
the
of
the
little
inn
he
was
feeling
very
unwell
and
there
was
a
burning
pain
in
his
chest
that
hurt
him
when
he
drew
a
deep
breath
and
then
too
he
was
very
cold
and
his
teeth
chattered
in
fits
as
though
he
had
suddenly
lost
control
of
them
and
they
had
become
some
other
teeth
well
why
not
go
into
the
little
inn
and
have
a
drink
then
he
would
go
back
to
bucket
lane
and
lie
down
and
never
wake
again
for
he
was
so
tired
that
he
had
never
known
before
what
it
was
to
be
tired
at
all
only
stephen
would
not
let
him
sleep
stephen
was
cruel
and
would
not
let
him
alone
no
one
would
let
him
alone
the
world
had
treated
him
very
evilly
what
did
he
owe
the
world
he
would
go
now
and
surrender
to
these
things
these
things
that
were
stronger
than
he
he
would
drink
and
he
would
sleep
and
that
should
be
the
end
of
everything
the
blessed
end
he
swayed
a
little
on
his
feet
and
he
put
his
hand
to
his
forehead
in
order
that
he
might
think
more
clearly
some
one
had
said
once
to
him
a
great
many
years
ago
it
is
not
life
that
matters
but
the
courage
that
you
bring
to
well
that
was
untrue
he
would
like
to
tell
the
man
who
had
said
that
that
he
was
a
liar
no
courage
could
be
enough
if
life
chose
to
be
hard
no
courage
nevertheless
the
thought
of
somewhere
a
long
time
ago
when
some
one
had
said
that
to
him
slowly
filled
his
tired
brain
with
a
distaste
for
the
little
inn
with
the
he
would
not
go
there
yet
just
a
little
while
and
then
he
would
go
almost
dreaming
certainly
seeing
nothing
about
him
that
he
recognised
he
stumbled
confusedly
down
to
the
embankment
here
there
was
at
any
rate
air
he
drew
his
shabby
blue
coat
more
closely
about
him
and
sat
down
on
a
wooden
bench
in
company
with
a
lady
who
wore
a
large
damaged
feather
in
her
hat
and
a
red
stained
blouse
with
torn
lace
upon
it
and
a
skirt
of
a
bright
and
tarnished
blue
the
lady
gave
him
a
nod
cheer
chucky
she
said
peter
made
no
reply
down
on
your
uppers
my
word
you
look
bad
poor
kid
well
never
say
die
strike
me
blimy
but
there
a
good
day
coming
i
sat
here
once
before
said
peter
leaning
forward
and
addressing
her
very
earnestly
and
it
was
the
first
time
that
i
ever
heard
the
noise
that
london
makes
if
you
listen
you
can
hear
it
now
london
a
beast
you
know
but
the
lady
had
paid
very
little
attention
men
are
beasts
beasts
she
said
scowling
at
a
gap
in
the
side
of
her
boots
beasts
what
they
are
any
luck
the
last
few
nights
suppose
losin

looks

to
be
called
men
they
ai
mean
devils
leavin
me
like
this
curse
she
coughed
the
sun
had
set
now
and
the
lights
were
coming
out
like
glass
beads
on
a
string
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
stoppin
out
all
night
ducky

i

peter
looked
at
her
out
of
his
eyes
i
ca
bother
any
more
he
said
to
her
sleepily
they
so
cruel
they
wo

me
go
to

i
got
a
pain
here
in
my
chest

in
your
chest

leg

she
answered
where
a
chap
kicked
me
last
week
just
because
oh
well
she
paused
modestly
and
spat
again
it
comin
on
a
cold
little
wind
was
coming
up
the
river
ruffling
the
tips
of
the
trees
and
turning
the
leaves
of
the
back
as
though
it
wanted
to
clean
the
other
sides
of
them
peter
got
up
unsteadily
i
going
home
to
sleep
he
said
dreadfully
tired
so
long
chucky
the
lady
with
the
damaged
feather
said
to
him
he
left
her
eyeing
discontentedly
the
hole
in
her
boot
and
trying
to
fasten
with
confused
fingers
the
buttons
of
the
red
blouse
peter
mechanically
as
one
walking
in
a
dream
crept
into
an
omnibus
mechanically
he
left
it
and
mechanically
climbed
the
stairs
of
the
house
in
bucket
lane
there
were
two
fixed
thoughts
in
his
brain
one
was
that
no
one
in
the
world
had
ever
before
been
as
thirsty
as
he
was
and
that
he
would
willingly
commit
murder
or
any
violence
if
thereby
he
might
obtain
drink
and
the
other
thought
was
that
stephen
was
his
enemy
that
he
hated
stephen
because
stephen
never
left
him
alone
and
would
not
let
him
sleep
also
in
the
back
of
his
mind
distantly
as
though
it
concerned
some
one
else
that
he
was
very
unhappy
stephen
was
sitting
on
one
of
the
beds
looking
in
front
of
him
peter
moved
forward
heavily
and
sat
on
the
other
bed
they
looked
at
one
another
no
luck
said
stephen
armstrong
had
room
for
a
man
ricroft
would
see
me
peter
i
thinking
we
have
to
take
to
the
roads
peter
made
no
answer
yer
not
lookin
a
bit
well
lad
i
doubt
if
yer
can
stand
much
more
of
peter
looked
across
at
him
sullenly
why
ca
you
leave
me
alone
he
said
you
always
worrying
a
slow
flush
mounted
into
stephen
cheeks
but
he
said
nothing
well
why
do
you
say
something
nothing
to
say
it
is
bad
enough
that
you
brought
me
into
this
come
peter
stephen
answered
slowly
that
ai
fair
i
never
brought
you
into
this
i
done
my
oh
blame
me
of
course
that
natural
enough
if
it
had
been
for
you
stephen
came
into
the
middle
of
the
floor
come
peter
boy
yer
tired
yer
do
know
what
yer
saying
best
go
to
bed
do
be
saying
anything
that
yer
be
regretting
afterwards
peter
eyes
that
had
been
closed
suddenly
opened
blazing
oh
damn
you
and
your
talk
i
hate
you
i
wish
i
never
seen
you
a
rotten
kind
of
friendship
his
voice
died
off
into
muttering
stephen
went
back
to
his
bed
this
ai
fair
peter
he
said
in
a
low
voice
you
be
sorry
afterwards
i
ai
any
very
time
myself
these
last
weeks
and
now
their
nerves
were
like
hot
jangling
wires
suddenly
into
the
midst
of
that
bare
room
there
had
sprung
between
them
hatred
they
faced
each
other
they
could
have
leapt
at
one
another
throats
and
fought
suddenly
peter
gave
a
little
cry
that
seemed
to
fill
the
room
his
head
fell
forward
oh
stephen
stephen
i
so
damned
ill
i
so
damnably
he
caught
for
a
moment
at
his
chest
as
though
he
would
tear
his
shirt
open
then
he
stumbled
from
the
bed
and
lay
in
a
heap
on
the
floor
with
his
hands
spread
out
stephen
picked
him
up
in
his
arms
and
carried
him
on
to
his
bed
iii
the
little
doctor
who
attended
to
the
wants
of
bucket
lane
was
discovered
at
his
supper
he
was
a
dirty
little
man
with
large
dusty
spectacles
a
red
nose
and
a
bald
head
he
wore
an
old
faded
velveteen
jacket
out
of
the
pockets
of
which
stuck
innumerable
papers
he
was
very
often
drunk
and
had
a
shrew
of
a
wife
who
made
the
sober
parts
of
his
life
a
misery
but
he
was
and
generous
and
had
a
very
real
knowledge
of
his
business
williams
volubly
could
not
conceal
her
concern
at
condition
and
such
a
young
genelman
as
i
was
saying
only
yesterday
there
nothin
i
said
as
i
would
be
willin
to
do
for
that
there
poor
westcott
and
that
there
poor
brant
are
as
like
two
children
in
their
fightin
the
world
as
ever
i
see
and
ever
can
i
help
i
said
well
my
good
woman
the
little
doctor
finally
interrupted
you
can
help
here
and
now
by
getting
some
hot
water
and
the
other
things
put
down
when
she
was
gone
he
turned
slowly
to
stephen
who
stood
the
picture
of
despair
looking
down
upon
peter
goin
to
die
he
asked
that
depends
the
little
doctor
answered
the
boy
been
starved
ought
never
to
have
been
allowed
to
get
into
this
condition
both
of
you
hard
up
i
suppose
as
up
as
we
very
well
could
be
stephen
answered
grimly
well
has
he
no
friends
there
the
question
at
last
stephen
took
it
as
he
would
have
taken
a
blow
between
the
eyes
he
saw
very
clearly
that
the
end
of
his
reign
had
come
he
had
done
what
he
could
and
he
had
failed
but
in
him
was
the
fierce
furious
desire
to
fight
for
the
boy
why
should
he
give
him
up
now
when
they
had
spent
all
these
weeks
together
when
they
had
struggled
for
their
very
existence
side
by
side
what
right
had
any
of
these
others
to
peter
compared
with
his
right
he
knew
very
well
that
if
he
gave
him
up
now
the
boy
would
never
be
his
again
he
might
see
him
yes
but
that
passing
of
peter
that
he
had
already
begun
to
realise
would
be
accomplished
he
might
look
at
him
but
only
as
a
wanderer
may
look
from
the
valley
up
to
the
hill
the
doctor
broke
in
upon
him
as
he
stood
hesitating
there
come
he
said
roughly
we
have
not
much
time
the
boy
may
die
has
he
no
friends
stephen
turned
his
back
to
peter
yes
he
said
i
know
where
they
are
i
will
fetch
them
the
doctor
had
not
lived
in
bucket
lane
all
these
years
for
nothing
he
put
his
hand
on
stephen
arm
and
said
you
a
good
fellow
by
god
it
be
all
stephen
went
on
his
way
to
bennett
square
a
thousand
thoughts
filled
his
mind
he
knew
as
though
he
had
been
told
it
by
some
higher
power
that
peter
was
leaving
him
now
never
to
return
he
had
done
what
he
could
for
peter
now
the
boy
must
pass
on
to
others
who
might
be
able
more
fittingly
to
help
him
he
cursed
the
gods
that
they
had
not
allowed
him
to
obtain
work
during
these
weeks
for
then
peter
and
he
might
have
gone
on
working
prospering
and
the
parting
might
have
been
far
distant
but
he
felt
also
that
peter
destiny
was
something
higher
and
larger
than
anything
that
he
could
ever
compass
it
must
be
peter
life
that
he
should
always
be
leaving
people
behind
him
stages
on
his
road
until
he
had
attained
his
place
but
for
stephen
a
loneliness
swept
down
upon
him
that
seemed
to
turn
the
world
to
stone
never
in
all
the
years
of
his
wandering
had
he
known
anything
like
this
it
is
very
hard
that
a
man
should
care
for
only
two
creatures
in
the
world
and
that
he
should
be
held
by
god
hand
from
reaching
either
of
them
the
door
of
brockett
was
opened
to
him
by
a
servant
and
he
asked
for
brockett
in
the
cold
and
dark
hall
the
lady
sternly
awaited
him
but
the
sternness
fell
from
her
like
a
cloak
when
he
told
her
the
reason
of
his
coming
dear
me
and
the
poor
boy
so
ill
she
said
we
have
all
been
very
anxious
indeed
about
poor
peter
we
had
tried
every
clue
but
could
hear
nothing
of
him
we
were
especially
eager
to
find
him
because
miss
monogue
had
some
good
news
for
him
about
his
book
there
is
a
gentleman
a
friend
of
peter
who
has
been
doing
everything
to
find
him
who
is
with
miss
monogue
now
he
will
be
delighted
perhaps
you
will
go
stephen
can
have
looked
no
agreeable
object
at
this
time
worn
out
by
the
struggle
of
the
last
weeks
haggard
and
gaunt
his
beard
unkempt
but
norah
monogue
came
forward
to
him
with
both
her
hands
outstretched
oh
you
know
something
of
peter
tell
us
please
she
said
a
stout
gentleman
behind
her
was
introduced
as
galleon
stephen
explained
but
why
why
said
the
gentleman
did
you
let
us
know
before
my
good
fellow
stephen
brow
darkened
peter
did
wish
it
he
said
but
norah
monogue
came
forward
and
put
her
hand
on
his
arm
you
must
be
the
brant
about
whom
he
has
so
often
talked
she
said
i
am
so
glad
to
meet
you
at
last
peter
owes
so
much
to
you
we
have
been
trying
everywhere
to
get
word
of
him
because
some
publishers
have
taken
his
novel
and
think
very
well
of
it
indeed
but
come
do
let
us
go
at
once
there
is
no
time
to
lose
so
they
had
taken
his
novel
had
they
all
these
days
all
these
terrible
hours
that
starving
that
ghastly
anxiety
the
terror
all
these
things
had
been
unnecessary
had
they
only
known
this
separation
now
might
have
been
avoided
he
could
not
trust
himself
to
speak
to
bobby
galleon
and
norah
monogue
these
were
the
people
who
were
going
to
take
peter
away
he
turned
and
went
in
silence
down
the
stairs
at
bucket
lane
bobby
galleon
took
affairs
into
his
own
hands
at
once
peter
should
be
removed
to
his
house
in
chelsea
it
would
not
apparently
harm
him
to
be
moved
that
night
peter
was
still
unconscious
stephen
stood
in
the
back
of
the
room
and
watched
them
make
their
preparations
they
had
all
forgotten
him
for
a
moment
as
they
passed
down
the
stairs
stephen
had
his
last
glimpse
of
peter
he
saw
the
high
white
forehead
the
long
black
eyelashes
the
white
drawn
cheeks
at
this
parting
peter
had
no
eye
for
him
bobby
galleon
and
miss
monogue
both
spoke
to
stephen
pleasantly
before
they
went
away
stephen
did
not
hear
what
they
said
bobby
took
stephen
name
down
on
a
piece
of
paper
then
they
were
gone
they
were
all
gone
williams
looked
through
the
door
at
him
for
a
moment
but
something
in
the
man
face
drove
her
away
very
slowly
he
put
his
few
clothes
together
he
must
tramp
the
roads
again
the
hard
roads
the
glaring
sun
cold
moon
always
going
on
always
alone
he
shouldered
his
bag
and
went
out

i
burnished
clouds
swollen
with
golden
light
and
soft
and
changing
in
their
outline
were
sailing
against
a
pale
green
autumn
evening
sky
over
chelsea
it
was
nearly
six
and
at
the
knightsbridge
end
of
sloane
street
a
cloud
of
black
towers
quivered
against
the
pale
green
the
yellow
light
that
the
golden
clouds
shed
upon
the
earth
bathed
the
neat
and
demure
houses
of
sloane
street
in
a
brief
bewildered
unreality
sloane
street
not
accustomed
to
unreality
regretted
amiably
and
with
its
gentle
smile
that
nature
should
insist
once
every
day
for
some
or
so
on
these
mists
and
enchantments
the
neat
little
houses
called
their
masters
and
mistresses
within
doors
and
advised
them
to
rest
before
dressing
for
dinner
and
so
insured
these
many
comfortable
souls
that
they
should
not
be
disturbed
by
any
unwelcome
violence
on
their
emotions
soon
before
and
tables
shining
with
silver
bodies
would
be
tied
and
twisted
and
faces
would
be
powdered
and
painted
meanwhile
for
that
dying
moment
sloane
street
was
lifted
into
the
hearts
of
those
burnished
clouds
and
held
for
an
instant
in
glory
then
to
the
relief
of
the
neat
and
shining
houses
the
electric
lights
came
out
one
by
one
and
the
world
was
itself
again
beyond
sloane
square
however
the
king
road
chattered
and
rattled
and
minded
not
at
all
whether
the
sky
were
yellow
or
blue
this
was
the
hour
when
shopping
must
be
done
and
barrows
shone
beneath
their
flaring
gas
and
many
ladies
with
the
appearance
of
having
left
their
homes
for
the
merest
minute
hurried
from
stall
to
stall
the
king
road
stands
like
a
noisy
cheap
jack
outside
the
sanctities
of
chelsea
behind
its
chatter
are
the
quietest
streets
in
the
world
streets
that
are
silent
because
they
prefer
rest
to
noise
and
not
at
all
because
they
have
nothing
to
say
the
king
road
has
been
hired
by
chelsea
to
keep
foreigners
away
and
the
faint
smile
that
the
streets
wear
is
a
smile
of
relief
because
that
noisy
road
so
admirably
achieves
its
purpose
in
this
mellow
evening
light
the
little
houses
glow
through
the
river
mists
across
the
cobbles
the
stranger
on
leaving
the
king
road
behind
him
is
swept
into
a
quiet
intimacy
that
has
nothing
of
any
town
about
it
he
is
refreshed
as
he
might
be
were
he
to
leave
the
noisy
train
behind
him
and
plunge
into
the
dark
scented
and
see
before
him
the
twinkling
lights
of
some
friendly
inn
as
the
burnished
clouds
fade
from
the
sky
on
the
dark
surface
of
the
river
the
black
barges
hang
their
lights
and
in
cheyne
row
and
glebe
place
down
oakley
street
and
along
the
wide
spaces
of
cheyne
walk
lamps
burn
mildly
in
a
hundred
windows
guarded
on
one
side
by
the
sweeping
murmur
of
the
river
on
the
other
by
the
loud
grimaces
of
the
king
road
chelsea
sinks
with
a
sound
like
a
whisper
of
its
own
name
into
evening
as
the
last
trailing
fingers
of
the
golden
clouds
die
before
the
approaching
army
of
the
stars
as
the
yellow
above
the
horizon
gives
way
to
a
cold
and
iron
blue
lights
come
out
in
that
house
with
the
green
door
and

white
stone

ii
peter
had
on
the
very
afternoon
of
that
beautiful
evening
returned
from
the
sea
there
during
the
last
three
weeks
he
had
passed
his
convalescence
and
now
once
again
he
faced
the
world
galleon
and
the
galleon
baby
had
been
with
him
and
bobby
had
come
down
to
them
for
the
in
this
manner
peter
had
had
an
opportunity
of
getting
to
know
galleon
with
a
certainty
and
speed
that
nothing
else
could
have
given
him
during
the
first
weeks
after
his
removal
from
bucket
lane
he
had
been
too
ill
to
take
any
account
of
his
neighbours
or
surroundings
he
had
been
sent
down
to
the
sea
as
soon
as
it
was
possible
and
it
was
here
watching
her
quietly
or
listening
to
her
as
she
read
to
him
walking
a
little
with
her
playing
with
her
baby
that
he
grew
to
know
her
and
to
love
her
she
had
been
a
miss
alice
du
cane
at
first
an
intelligent
cynical
and
rather
trivial
person
then
suddenly
for
no
very
sure
reason
that
any
one
could
discover
her
character
changed
she
had
known
bobby
during
many
years
and
had
always
laughed
at
him
for
a
solemn
young
man
then
she
fell
in
love
with
him
and
to
his
own
wild
and
delirious
surprise
married
him
the
companions
of
her
earlier
girlhood
missed
her
cynicism
and
complained
that
brilliance
had
given
way
to
commonplace
but
you
could
not
find
in
the
whole
of
london
a
happier
marriage
to
peter
she
was
something
entirely
new
norah
monogue
was
the
only
woman
with
whom
as
yet
he
had
come
into
any
close
contact
and
she
by
her
very
humility
had
allowed
him
to
assume
to
her
a
superior
rather
patronising
attitude
the
brief
vision
of
clare
rossiter
had
been
altogether
of
the
opposite
kind
partaking
too
furiously
of
heaven
to
have
any
earthly
quality
but
here
in
alice
galleon
he
discovered
a
woman
who
gave
him
something
companionship
a
lively
and
critical
intelligence
some
indefinable
quality
of
charm
that
was
entirely
new
to
him
she
chaffed
him
criticised
him
admired
him
absorbed
him
and
nattered
him
in
a
breath
she
told
him
that
he
had
a
degree
of
talent
that
he
was
the
youngest
and
most
ignorant
person
for
his
age
that
she
had
ever
met
that
he
was
conceited
that
he
was
rough
and
he
had
no
manners
that
he
was
too
humble
that
he
was
a
flopper
because
he
was
so
anxious
to
please
that
he
was
a
boy
and
an
old
man
at
the
same
time
and
finally
that
the
galleon
baby
a
solemn
child
had
taken
to
him
as
it
had
never
taken
to
any
one
during
the
eventful
three
years
of
its
life
behind
these
contradictory
criticisms
peter
knew
that
there
was
a
friend
and
he
was
sensible
enough
also
to
realise
that
many
of
the
things
that
she
said
to
him
were
perfectly
true
and
that
he
would
do
well
to
take
them
to
heart
at
first
she
had
made
him
angry
and
that
had
delighted
her
so
he
had
been
angry
no
longer
it
seemed
to
him
during
these
days
of
convalescence
that
the
solemn
melodramatic
young
man
of
bucket
lane
was
an
incredibility
and
yet
although
he
felt
that
that
episode
had
been
definitely
closed
shut
off
as
it
were
by
wide
doors
that
held
back
at
a
distance
every
sound
the
noise
the
confusion
the
terror
was
nevertheless
there
but
for
the
moment
the
doors
were
closed
only
in
his
dreams
they
rolled
back
and
night
after
night
he
awoke
screaming
bathed
in
sweat
trembling
from
head
to
foot
sometimes
he
thought
that
he
saw
an
army
of
rats
advancing
across
the
floor
of
their
bucket
lane
room
and
stephen
and
he
beat
them
off
but
ever
they
returned
once
he
thought
that
their
room
was
invaded
by
a
number
of
old
toothless
hags
who
came
in
at
the
door
and
the
window
and
these
creatures
with
taloned
fingers
fought
screeching
and
rolling
their
eyes
twice
he
dreamt
that
he
saw
on
a
hill
high
uplifted
against
a
stormy
sky
the
statue
of
the
man
on
the
lion
gigantic
he
struggled
to
see
the
rider
face
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
multitudes
of
other
persons
men
and
women
were
pleading
with
hands
uplifted
that
they
too
might
see
the
face
but
always
it
was
denied
them
and
peter
woke
with
a
strange
oppression
of
crushing
disappointment
sometimes
he
dreamt
of
scaw
house
and
it
was
always
the
same
dream
he
saw
the
old
room
with
the
marble
clock
and
the
cactus
plant
but
about
it
all
now
there
was
dust
and
neglect
in
the
by
the
fire
facing
the
window
his
father
old
now
and
bent
was
sitting
listening
and
waiting
the
wind
howled
about
the
place
old
boards
creaked
casements
rattled
and
his
father
never
moved
but
leaning
forward
in
his
chair
watched
waited
eagerly
passionately
for
some
news
iii
they
were
having
dinner
now
bobby
galleon
and
peter
in
the
studio
of
the
cheyne
walk
house
outside
a
sheet
of
stars
a
dark
river
and
the
pale
lamps
of
the
street
the
curtains
of
the
studio
were
still
undrawn
and
the
glow
from
the
night
beyond
fell
softly
along
the
gleaming
black
boards
of
the
floor
that
stretched
into
shadow
by
the
farther
wall
over
the
round
mahogany
table
without
a
cloth
and
shining
with
its
own
colour
deep
and
liquid
brown
and
out
to
the
pictures
that
hung
in
their
dull
gold
frames
along
the
wall
about
peter
was
a
sense
of
ease
and
rest
of
space
that
was
as
new
to
him
as
america
was
to
columbus
he
was
not
even
now
completely
recovered
from
his
bucket
lane
experiences
and
there
was
still
about
him
that
uncertainty
of
life
when
one
sees
it
as
though
through
gauze
curtains
that
gives
reality
to
the
quality
of
dreams
life
was
behind
him
life
was
ahead
of
him
but
meantime
let
him
rest
in
this
uncertain
and
beautiful
country
until
it
was
time
for
him
to
go
forward
again
this
intangibility
walking
as
it
were
in
a
fog
round
and
round
the
nelson
monument
knowing
it
was
there
but
never
seeing
it
remained
with
him
even
when
practical
matters
were
discussed
for
instance
reuben
hallard
was
to
be
published
in
a
week
time
and
peter
was
to
receive
fifty
pounds
in
advance
on
the
day
of
publication
unusually
good
terms
for
a
first
novel
bobby
assured
him
also
bobby
through
his
father
thought
that
he
could
secure
peter
regular
reviewing
the
intention
then
was
that
peter
should
remain
with
the
galleons
as
a
kind
of
paying
guest
and
so
his
pride
would
not
be
hurt
and
they
could
have
an
eye
upon
him
during
this
launching
of
him
into
london
it
was
fortunate
perhaps
that
alice
galleon
had
liked
him
down
there
at
the
sea
because
she
was
a
lady
who
had
her
own
way
at
no
and
she
by
no
means
liked
every
one
but
perhaps
the
galleon
baby
had
had
more
to
do
with
everything
than
any
one
knew
and
galleon
assured
her
friends
that
the
baby
heart
would
most
certainly
be
broken
if
the
wild
young
guest
as
she
called
peter
were
carried
off
and
wild
he
was
of
that
seeing
him
now
at
dinner
there
in
the
studio
there
could
be
no
doubt
he
was
wearing
bobby
clothes
and
there
was
still
a
look
of
suffering
in
his
eyes
and
around
his
mouth
but
the
difference
his
difference
from
the
things
about
him
went
deeper
than
that
the
large
high
windows
of
the
studio
with
the
expanse
of
wild
and
burning
stars
between
their
black
frames
answered
peter
eyes
as
he
faced
them
galleon
as
she
watched
him
was
reminded
of
other
things
of
other
persons
of
other
events
that
had
marked
his
earlier
life
she
glanced
from
peter
eyes
to
bobby
she
smiled
for
on
an
earlier
day
she
had
seen
that
same
antithesis
the
gulf
that
is
fixed
between
imagination
and
reality
and
had
known
its
meaning
but
for
peter
all
he
asked
now
was
that
he
might
be
allowed
to
rest
in
the
midst
of
this
glorious
comfort
his
evil
dreams
were
very
far
away
from
him
the
food
the
colour
the
fruit
piled
high
in
the
silver
dishes
the
glittering
of
the
great
silver
candelabra
that
stood
on
the
middle
of
the
table
the
deep
red
of
the
roses
in
the
bowl
at
his
side
the
deeper
red
of
the
port
that
shone
in
front
of
bobby
and
then
beneath
all
this
as
though
the
table
were
a
coloured
ship
sailing
on
a
solemn
sea
the
dark
deep
shining
floor
that
faded
into
shadow
all
this
excited
him
so
that
his
hands
trembled
he
spoke
to
galleon
i
wonder
if
you
will
do
me
a
favour
he
said
very
earnestly
anything
in
reason
she
answered
laughing
back
at
his
gravity
well
do
call
me
westcott
any
more
because
i
going
to
live
here
and
because
i
too
old
a
friend
of
bobby
and
because
finally
i
hate
being
called
westcott
by
anybody
might
it
be
peter
joseph
calls
him
peter
as
it
is
said
bobby
quite
earnestly
looking
at
his
wife
they
were
both
so
grave
about
it
that
alice
galleon
could
be
anything
but
grave
too
she
knew
that
it
was
really
a
definite
appeal
on
behalf
of
both
of
them
that
she
should
here
and
now
solemnly
put
her
sign
of
approval
on
peter
it
was
almost
in
the
way
that
they
waited
for
her
to
answer
a
ceremony
she
was
even
as
she
looked
at
them
surprised
into
a
sudden
burst
of
tenderness
towards
them
both
bobby
so
solemn
such
a
dear
really
quite
an
age
and
yet
as
young
as
any
infant
in
arms
peter
with
forces
and
impulses
that
might
lead
to
anything
or
wreck
him
altogether
and
yet
through
it
all
younger
even
than
bobby
oh
what
an
age
she
alice
galleon
seemed
to
muster
at
the
sight
of
their
innocent
trust
did
every
woman
feel
as
old
as
protecting
as
tenderly
indulgent
towards
every
man
why
of
course
she
answered
quietly
peter
it
shall
be
bobby
raised
his
port
here
to
peter
to
peter
and
hallard
overwhelming
success
to
both
of
emotion
for
an
instant
held
them
then
quietly
they
stepped
back
again
it
was
almost
too
good
to
be
true
that
after
all
the
turnings
and
twistings
life
should
have
brought
peter
to
this
he
did
not
look
very
far
ahead
he
did
not
ask
himself
whether
the
book
were
likely
to
be
a
success
whether
his
career
would
justify
this
beginning
if
only
they
would
let
him
alone
he
did
not
even
to
himself
name
those
powers
he
was
wrapped
about
with
comfort
he
had
friends
above
all
and
this
he
had
discovered
at
the
sea
the
galleons
knew
miss
rossiter
this
last
thought
seemed
by
the
glorious
clamour
of
it
to
draw
that
sheet
of
stars
down
through
the
window
into
the
room
the
air
crackled
with
their
splendour
he
was
drawn
back
down
into
the
world
again
by
hearing
bobby
voice
the
evening
post
and
a
letter
for
you
he
looked
down
and
with
a
sudden
pang
of
accusing
shame
because
he
had
forgotten
so
easily
with
also
a
sure
knowledge
that
that
easy
escape
from
his
other
life
was
already
forbidden
him
saw
that
the
letter
was
from
stephen
he
felt
that
their
eyes
were
upon
him
as
he
took
the
letter
up
and
he
also
felt
that
in
alice
galleon
gaze
there
was
a
wise
and
tender
understanding
of
the
things
that
he
must
be
feeling
the
roughness
of
the
envelope
the
rudeness
of
the
a
stain
in
one
corner
that
might
be
beer
the
stamp
set
crookedly
these
things
seemed
to
him
like
so
many
voices
that
called
him
back
five
minutes
ago
those
days
in
bucket
lane
had
belonged
to
another
life
now
he
was
still
there
and
he
must
tramp
out
again
the
letter
said
here

one
day
and

letter
they
are
getting
too
much
into
their
bellies
and
making
the
devil
own
noise
there
is
thunder
coming
the
air
is
that
still
over
the
roof
of
the
barn
and
the
road
dead
white
dear
boy
i
am
your
friend
stephen
brant
the
candles
blew
a
little
in
the
breeze
from
the
open
window
and
the
lighted
shadows
ran
flickering
in
silver
lines
along
the
dark
floor
peter
stood
holding
the
letter
in
his
hand
looking
out
on
to
the
black
square
of
sky
the
lights
of
the
barges
swung
down
the
river
and
he
could
hear
very
faintly
the
straining
of
ropes
and
the
turning
of
some
mysterious
wheel
he
saw
stephen
the
great
head
the
flowing
beard
the
huge
body
and
then
the
inn
with
the
thunder
coming
over
the
hill
and
then
beyond
that
treliss
gleaming
with
its
tiers
of
lights
above
the
breast
of
the
sea
and
from
here
from
this
wide
embankment
down
to
that
sea
there
stretched
riding
over
hills
bending
into
valleys
always
white
and
hard
and
stony
the
road
for
an
instant
he
felt
as
though
the
studio
the
lights
the
comforts
were
holding
him
like
a
prison
it
a
letter
from
stephen
brant
he
said
turning
back
from
the
window
he
seems
well
and
happy
where
is
he
eating
bread
and
cheese
at
an
inn
somewhere
on
the
road
down
to
iv
on
the
following
tuesday
reuben
hallard
was
published
and
on
the
thursday
afternoon
henry
galleon
and
clare
rossiter
were
to
come
to
tea
reuben
hallard
arrived
in
a
dark
red
cover
with
a
white
paper
label
the
six
copies
lay
on
the
table
and
looked
at
peter
as
though
he
had
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
their
existence
he
looked
down
upon
them
opened
one
of
them
very
tenderly
read
half
a
page
and
felt
that
it
was
the
best
stuff
he
ever
seen
he
read
the
rest
of
the
page
and
thought
that
the
author
whoever
the
creature
might
be
deserved
imprisonment
for
writing
such
nonsense
the
feeling
of
strangeness
towards
it
all
was
increased
by
the
fact
that
bobby
had
with
the
exception
of
the
final
proofs
these
peter
had
read
down
by
the
sea
done
most
of
the
it
was
a
task
for
which
his
practical
common
sense
and
lack
of
all
imagination
admirably
fitted
him
there
at
any
rate
reuben
hallard
was
ready
to
face
all
the
world
to
go
perhaps
to
the
farthest
hebrides
to
be
lost
in
all
probability
utterly
lost
in
the
turgid
flood
of
contemporary
fiction
there
was
a
dedication
to
stephen
how
surprised
stephen
would
be
he
looked
at
the
chapter
headings
an
old
man
with
a
lantern
the
road
at
night
sun
on
the
western
moor
stevenson
tushery
all
of
it
how
they
tear
it
to
bits
those
papers
he
laughed
to
himself
to
think
that
there
had
once
been
a
day
when
he
had
thought
that
the
thing
would
make
his
fortune
and
yet
he
turned
the
pages
over
tenderly
there
might
be
something
to
be
said
for
it
miss
monogue
had
thought
well
of
it
these
publishers
blasé
cynical
fellows
surely
believed
in
it
it
was
fat
and
red
and
comfortable
it
had
a
worldly
prosperous
look
reuben
hallard
and
his
adventures
good
lord
what
cheek
there
were
five
copies
to
give
away
one
between
bobby
and
galleon
one
for
stephen
one
for
miss
monogue
one
for
brockett
and
one
for
zanti
reuben
hallard
and
his
adventures
by
peter
westcott
they
would
be
getting
it
now
at
the
newspaper
offices
would
have
a
copy
and
the
fat
little
chocolate
consumer
it
would
stand
with
a
heap
of
others
and
be
ticked
off
with
a
heap
of
others
for
some
youth
to
exercise
his
wit
upon
as
to
any
one
buying
the
book
who
ever
saw
any
one
buying
a
novel
it
was
only
within
the
last
year
or
so
that
the
old
three
volumes
with
their
had
departed
this
life
the
publishers
had
assured
peter
that
this
new
form
was
the
thing
please
have
you
got
hallard
by
peter
westcott
thank
you
i
take
it
with
no
it
was
inconceivable
there
poor
reuben
would
lie
deserted
ever
dustier
and
dustier
whilst
other
stories
came
pouring
pouring
from
endless
presses
covering
crowding
it
down
stamping
upon
it
burying
it
here
lies
hallard
poor
peter
on
thursday
however
there
was
the
a
thursday
never
to
be
forgotten
whilst
peter
was
alive
bobby
had
told
him
the
day
before
that
his
father
might
be
coming
the
rest
of
the
family
will
turn
up
for
certain
they
want
to
see
you
they
always
all
agog
for
any
new
thing
one
of
them
always
playing
cabot
to
somebody
else
columbus
but
father
uncertain
he
gets
something
into
his
head
and
then
nothing
whatever
will
draw
him
out
but
i
expect
he
turn
the
other
visitor
was
announced
to
peter
on
the
very
day
by
the
way
peter
somebody
coming
to
tea
this
afternoon
met
you
before
met
you
at
that
odd
of
yours
a
miss
rossiter
clare
an
old
friend
of
ours
i
told
you
down
at
the
sea
about
her
and
you
said
you
remembered
meeting
remembered
meeting
her
did
dante
remember
meeting
beatrice
did
petrarch
remember
laura
did
keats
forget
his
fanny
brawne
did
richard
feverel
forget
his
lucy
on
a
level
with
these
gentlemen
was
peter
disguising
his
emotions
from
alice
sharp
eyes
but
silent
breathless
wanting
some
other
place
than
that
high
studio
in
which
to
breathe
yes
she
came
to
tea
once
with
a
miss
monogue
there
i
liked
her
he
was
not
there
but
rather
on
some
height
alone
with
her
and
their
hands
touched
over
a
photograph
the
man
on
the
there
was
something
worthy
of
his
feeling
for
her
meanwhile
for
the
first
part
of
the
afternoon
one
must
put
up
with
the
galleon
family
had
peter
been
sufficiently
calm
and
sensible
these
appendages
to
a
great
author
would
have
been
worth
his
attention
behold
them
in
relation
to
henry
lessingham
soaked
in
the
works
bearing
on
their
backs
the
whole
edition
de
luxe
decking
themselves
with
the
little
odds
and
ends
of
literary
finery
that
they
had
picked
up
bursting
with
the
of
assured
harmless
foolish
comfortable
galleon
was
massive
with
a
large
flat
face
that
jumped
suddenly
into
expression
when
one
least
expected
it
there
was
a
great
deal
of
silk
about
her
much
leisurely
movement
and
her
tactics
were
silence
and
a
slow
significant
smile
these
she
always
contributed
to
any
conversation
that
was
really
beyond
her
had
she
not
during
many
years
of
her
life
been
married
to
a
genius
she
would
have
been
an
intensely
but
adequate
housekeeper
as
it
was
her
size
and
her
silence
enabled
her
to
keep
her
place
at
many
literary
dinners
peter
watching
her
was
consumed
with
wonder
that
henry
galleon
could
ever
have
married
her
and
understood
that
bobby
was
the
child
of
both
his
parents
bobby
had
a
brother
and
sister
percival
and
millicent
percival
was
and
had
written
two
novels
that
were
considered
promising
by
those
who
did
not
know
that
he
was
the
son
of
his
father
he
was
slim
and
dark
with
a
black
thread
of
a
moustache
and
rather
fine
white
fingers
his
clothes
were
very
well
cut
but
his
appearance
was
a
little
too
elaborately
simple
his
sister
a
girl
of
about
eighteen
was
slim
and
dark
also
she
had
the
eager
appearance
of
one
who
has
heard
just
enough
to
make
her
very
anxious
to
hear
a
great
deal
more
one
felt
that
she
did
not
want
to
miss
anything
but
probably
her
determination
to
be
her
father
daughter
would
prevent
her
from
becoming
very
valuable
or
intelligent
finally
it
was
strange
that
bobby
had
so
completely
escaped
the
shadow
of
his
father
mantle
these
people
were
intended
of
course
to
be
the
background
of
peter
afternoon
and
it
was
therefore
more
than
annoying
that
that
was
the
very
last
thing
that
they
were
millicent
and
percival
made
a
ball
and
then
flung
it
backwards
and
forwards
throughout
the
affair
their
mother
watched
them
with
appreciation
and
alice
galleon
who
knew
them
gave
them
tea
and
cake
and
let
them
have
their
way
into
the
midst
of
this
henry
galleon
came
a
little
round
fat
man
with
a
face
like
a
map
the
body
of
napoleon
and
a
trot
round
the
room
like
a
very
amiable
pony
eyes
that
saw
everything
understood
everything
and
forgave
everything
a
brown
buff
waistcoat
with
gilt
buttons
white
spats
and
a
voice
that
rolled
and
roared
he
was
the
tenderest
most
alarming
person
in
any
kind
of
a
world
he
was
so
gentle
that
any
sparrow
would
trust
him
implicitly
and
so
terrific
that
an
army
would
most
certainly
fly
from
before
him
he
ate
smiled
and
shook
hands
with
peter
listened
for
half
an
hour
to
the
spirited
conversation
of
his
two
children
and
trotted
away
again
leaving
behind
him
an
atmosphere
of
gentle
politeness
and
an
amazing
that
one
saw
his
children
struggling
to
catch
they
finally
gave
it
up
about
five
and
retreated
pressing
peter
to
pay
them
a
call
at
the
earliest
opportunity
this
was
positively
all
that
peter
saw
on
this
occasion
of
henry
galleon
it
was
quite
enough
to
give
him
a
great
deal
to
think
about
but
it
could
scarcely
be
called
a
meeting
at
quarter
to
six
when
peter
was
in
despair
and
alice
galleon
had
ordered
the
to
be
taken
away
clare
rossiter
rushed
in
she
stood
a
whirlwind
of
flying
colours
in
the
middle
of
the
studio
now
sinking
into
twilight
alice
dear
i
am
most
terribly
sorry
but
mother
stay
i
could
get
her
to
leave
and
it
was
all
so
awkward
how
do
you
do
westcott
do
you
remember
we
met
at
treliss
and
now
i
must
rush
back
this
very
minute
we
are
dining
at
seven
before
the
opera
and
father
wants
that
music
you
promised
him
the
brahms
thing
oh
is
it
upstairs
well
if
you
do
mind
alice
galleon
left
them
together
peter
could
say
nothing
at
all
he
stood
there
shifting
from
foot
to
foot
white
absolutely
she
felt
his
embarrassment
and
struggled
i
hear
that
you
been
very
ill
westcott
i
so
dreadfully
sorry
and
i
do
hope
that
you
better
he
muttered
something
your
book
is
out
is
it
hallard
is
the
name
i
must
get
father
to
put
it
down
on
his
list
one
first
books
must
be
so
dreadfully
exciting
and
so
alarming
the
reviews
and
everything
what
is
it
about
he
murmured
cornwall
how
delightful
i
was
only
there
once
mullion
do
you
know
mullion
she
struggled
along
the
pain
that
had
begun
in
his
heart
was
now
at
his
throat
his
throat
was
full
of
spiders
webs
he
could
scarcely
see
her
in
the
dark
but
her
pale
blue
dress
and
her
dark
eyes
and
her
beautiful
white
hands
her
little
figure
danced
against
the
dark
shining
floor
like
a
fairy
he
heard
her
sigh
of
relief
at
alice
galleon
return
oh
thank
you
dear
so
much
westcott
i
shall
read
the
she
was
gone
lights
lights
cried
alice
galleon
how
provoking
of
her
not
to
come
to
tea
properly
well
peter
how
was
it
all
he
was
guilty
of
abominable
rudeness
he
burst
from
the
room
without
a
word
and
banged
desperately
the
door
behind
him
chapter
ii
a
chapter
about
success
i
how
to
win
it
how
to
keep
it
with
a
note
at
the
end
from
henry
galleon
i
the
shout
of
applause
with
which
reuben
hallard
was
greeted
still
remains
one
of
the
interesting
cases
in
modern
literary
history
at
this
time
of
day
it
all
seems
ancient
and
distant
enough
the
book
has
been
praised
blamed
lifted
up
hurled
down
a
thousand
times
and
has
finally
been
discovered
to
be
a
book
of
promise
of
natural
talent
with
a
great
deal
of
crudity
and
melodrama
and
a
little
beauty
it
does
not
stand
of
course
in
comparison
with
peter
westcott
later
period
and
yet
it
has
a
note
that
his
hand
never
captured
afterwards
how
incredibly
bad
it
is
in
places
the
datchett
incidents
with
their
flames
and
screams
and
murder
in
the
dark
sufficiently
betray
how
fine
it
can
be
such
a
delight
as
the
cherry
orchard
chapter
shows
and
perhaps
the
very
badness
of
the
crudities
helped
in
its
popularity
for
there
was
nothing
more
remarkable
about
it
than
the
fashion
in
which
it
captured
every
class
of
reader
but
its
success
in
reality
was
a
result
of
the
exact
moment
of
its
appearance
had
peter
waited
a
thousand
years
he
could
not
possibly
have
chosen
a
time
more
favourable
it
was
that
moment
in
literary
history
when
the
world
had
had
enough
of
lilies
and
was
turning
with
relief
to
artichokes
there
was
a
periodical
of
this
time
entitled
green
this
appeared
somewhere
about
and
it
brought
with
it
a
band
of
young
men
and
women
who
were
exceedingly
clever
saw
the
quaintness
of
life
before
its
reality
and
stood
on
tiptoe
in
order
to
observe
things
that
were
really
growing
quite
close
to
the
ground
this
quarterly
produced
some
very
admirable
work
its
contributors
were
all
for
a
year
or
two
as
clever
as
they
were
young
and
as
cynical
as
either
the
world
was
dressed
in
a
powder
puff
and
danced
beneath
chinese
lanterns
and
was
as
wicked
as
it
could
be
in
artificial
it
was
all
great
fun
for
a
year
or
two
then
green
died
people
began
to
whisper
about
slums
and
drainage
and
swedish
drill
for
ten
minutes
every
morning
was
considered
an
admirable
thing
on
the
edge
of
this
new
wave
came
reuben
hallard
combining
as
it
did
a
certain
amount
of
affectation
with
a
good
deal
of
naked
truth
and
having
the
rocks
of
cornwall
as
well
as
its
primroses
for
its
background
it
also
told
a
story
with
a
beginning
to
it
and
an
end
to
it
and
it
contained
the
beautiful
character
of
poveret
a
character
that
was
undoubtedly
inspired
by
that
afternoon
that
peter
had
with
his
in
addition
to
all
this
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
world
was
entirely
unprepared
for
the
book
arrival
it
had
been
in
no
fashion
heralded
and
until
a
long
review
appeared
in
daily
no
one
noticed
it
in
any
way
then
the
thing
really
began
the
reviewers
were
glad
to
find
something
in
a
dead
season
about
which
a
column
or
two
might
possibly
be
written
the
general
public
was
delighted
to
discover
a
novel
that
was
considered
by
good
judges
to
be
literature
and
that
nevertheless
had
as
good
a
story
as
though
it
were
its
faults
were
many
and
some
of
its
virtues
accidental
but
it
certainly
deserved
success
as
thoroughly
as
did
most
of
its
contemporaries
edition
followed
edition
and
reuben
hallard
was
the
novel
of
the
spring
of
the
effect
of
all
this
upon
peter
may
easily
be
imagined
it
came
to
him
first
with
those
early
reviews
and
an
encouraging
letter
from
the
publishers
as
something
that
did
not
belong
to
him
at
all
then
after
a
month
or
so
it
belonged
to
him
so
completely
that
he
felt
as
though
he
had
been
used
to
it
all
his
life
then
slowly
as
the
weeks
passed
and
the
success
continued
he
knew
that
the
publication
of
this
book
had
changed
the
course
of
his
life
letters
from
agents
and
publishers
asking
for
his
next
novel
letters
from
america
letters
from
unknown
readers
all
these
things
showed
him
that
he
could
look
now
towards
countries
that
had
not
hitherto
been
enclosed
by
his
horizon
he
breathed
another
air
and
yet
he
was
astonishingly
simple
about
it
all
very
young
and
very
naive
the
two
things
that
he
felt
about
it
were
first
that
it
would
please
very
much
his
friends
bobby
and
his
wife
brockett
norah
monogue
zanti
herr
gottfried
and
above
all
stephen
and
secondly
that
all
those
early
years
in
cornwall
the
beatings
his
mother
scaw
house
even
dawson
had
been
of
use
to
him
one
remembers
those
extraordinary
chapters
concerning
reuben
and
his
father
here
peter
had
for
the
first
time
allowed
some
expression
of
his
attitude
to
it
all
to
escape
him
he
felt
indeed
as
though
the
success
of
the
book
placed
for
a
moment
all
that
other
life
in
the
background
really
away
from
him
for
the
first
time
since
he
left
brockett
he
was
free
from
a
strange
feeling
of
apprehension
scaw
house
was
hidden
he
gave
himself
up
to
glorious
life
he
plunged
into
it
ii
he
stepped
at
first
timidly
into
literary
london
it
was
at
first
sight
alarming
enough
because
it
seemed
to
consist
so
largely
and
so
stridently
of
the
opposite
sex
bobby
would
have
had
peter
avoid
it
altogether
there
are
some
young
idiots
he
said
who
go
about
to
these
literary
they
just
written
a
line
or
two
somewhere
or
other
and
they
go
curving
and
bending
all
over
the
place
young
tony
gale
and
young
robin
trojan
and
my
young
ass
of
a
brother
want
you
to
join
that
lot
peter
my
boy
the
women
like
to
have
of
course
they
useful
for
handing
the
cake
about
but
that
all
there
is
to
it
keep
out
of
but
peter
had
not
had
so
many
friends
during
the
early
part
of
his
life
that
he
could
afford
to
do
without
possible
ones
now
he
wanted
indeed
just
as
many
as
he
could
grasp
the
comfort
and
happiness
of
his
life
with
bobby
the
success
of
the
book
the
opening
of
a
career
in
front
of
him
these
things
had
made
of
him
another
creature
he
had
grown
ten
years
younger
his
cheeks
were
bright
his
eye
clear
his
step
buoyant
he
moved
now
as
though
he
loved
his
fellow
creatures
one
felt
on
his
entrance
into
a
room
that
the
air
was
clearer
and
that
one
was
in
the
company
of
a
human
being
who
found
the
world
quite
honestly
and
naturally
a
delightful
place
this
was
the
first
effect
that
success
had
upon
peter
and
indeed
they
met
him
all
of
them
with
open
arms
they
saw
in
him
that
burning
flame
that
those
who
have
been
for
the
first
time
admitted
into
the
freemasonry
of
their
art
must
ever
show
afterwards
he
would
be
accustomed
to
that
country
would
know
its
roads
and
hills
and
cities
and
would
be
perhaps
disappointed
that
they
were
neither
as
holy
nor
as
eternal
as
he
had
once
imagined
them
to
be
now
he
stood
on
the
edge
and
looked
down
into
a
golden
landscape
whose
bounds
he
could
not
discern
but
they
met
him
too
on
the
personal
side
the
fact
that
he
had
been
found
starving
in
a
london
garret
was
of
itself
a
wonderful
thing
then
he
had
in
his
manner
a
rough
awkward
charm
that
flattered
them
with
his
youth
and
inexperience
he
was
impetuous
and
confidential
and
then
suddenly
reserved
and
constrained
but
above
it
all
it
was
evident
that
he
wanted
friendliness
and
good
fellowship
he
took
every
one
at
the
value
that
they
offered
to
him
he
first
encouraged
them
to
be
at
their
most
human
and
then
convinced
them
that
that
was
their
natural
character
he
lighted
every
one
lamp
at
the
flame
of
his
own
implicit
faith
these
ladies
and
gentlemen
put
very
plainly
before
him
the
business
side
of
his
profession
their
conversation
was
all
of
agents
publishers
the
sums
that
one
of
their
number
obtained
and
how
lucky
to
get
so
much
so
soon
and
the
sums
that
another
of
their
number
did
not
obtain
and
what
a
shame
it
was
that
such
good
work
was
rewarded
by
so
little
it
was
all
this
conversation
in
the
most
generous
strain
jealousy
never
raised
its
head
they
read
these
precious
people
the
works
of
one
another
with
an
eager
praise
and
a
tender
condemnation
delightful
to
see
it
was
a
warm
bustling
society
that
received
peter
these
and
fireside
discussions
had
not
perhaps
been
always
so
friendly
and
but
in
the
time
when
peter
first
encountered
them
they
were
influenced
and
moulded
by
a
very
remarkable
woman
a
woman
who
succeeded
in
combining
humour
common
sense
and
imagination
in
admirably
adjusted
qualities
her
humour
made
her
tolerant
her
common
sense
made
her
wise
and
her
imagination
made
her
tender
her
name
was
launce
she
was
short
and
broad
with
large
blue
eyes
that
always
if
one
watched
them
showed
her
thoughts
and
dispositions
some
people
make
of
their
faces
a
disguise
others
use
them
as
a
revelation
the
result
to
the
observer
is
very
much
the
same
in
either
case
but
with
launce
there
was
no
definite
attempt
at
either
one
thing
or
the
other
she
was
so
busily
engaged
in
the
matter
in
hand
so
absorbed
and
interested
that
the
things
that
her
face
might
be
doing
never
occurred
to
her
her
hair
was
drawn
back
and
parted
down
the
middle
she
liked
to
wear
little
straw
bonnets
she
was
very
fond
of
blue
silk
and
her
frocks
had
an
inclination
to
trail
on
her
mother
side
she
was
french
and
on
her
father
english
from
her
mother
she
got
the
technique
of
her
stories
the
boldness
of
her
conversation
and
her
extraordinary
devotion
to
her
family
she
was
always
something
of
a
puzzle
to
english
women
because
she
was
a
great
deal
more
domestic
than
most
of
them
and
yet
bristled
with
theories
about
morals
and
life
in
general
that
had
nothing
whatever
in
common
with
domesticity
some
one
once
said
of
her
that
she
was
a
hot
water
bottle
playing
at
being
a
bomb
she
belonged
to
all
the
london
worlds
although
she
found
perhaps
especial
pleasure
in
the
society
of
her
fellow
writers
this
was
largely
because
she
loved
beyond
everything
else
the
business
side
of
her
profession
there
was
nothing
at
all
that
she
did
not
know
about
the
publishing
and
distribution
of
a
novel
her
capacity
for
remembering
other
people
prices
was
prodigious
and
she
managed
her
agent
and
her
publisher
with
a
deftness
that
left
them
gasping
there
were
very
few
persons
in
her
world
who
had
not
at
one
time
or
another
poured
their
troubles
into
her
ear
she
had
that
gift
valuable
in
life
beyond
all
others
of
giving
herself
up
entirely
to
the
person
with
whom
she
was
talking
when
the
time
came
to
give
advice
the
combination
of
her
common
sense
and
her
tenderness
made
her
invaluable
there
was
no
crime
black
enough
no
desertion
no
cruelty
horrible
enough
to
outspeed
her
pity
she
hated
and
understood
the
sin
and
loved
and
comforted
the
sinner
with
a
wide
and
accurate
knowledge
of
humanity
she
combined
a
deep
spiritual
belief
in
the
goodness
of
god
everything
however
horrible
interested
her
she
adored
life
this
little
person
in
the
straw
bonnet
and
the
blue
dress
gave
peter
something
that
he
had
never
known
before
she
mothered
him
he
sat
next
to
her
at
some
and
she
asked
him
to
come
and
have
tea
with
her
she
lived
in
a
little
street
in
westminster
in
a
tiny
house
that
had
her
children
on
the
top
floor
a
beautiful
copy
of
the
mona
lisa
and
a
very
untidy
on
the
second
and
a
little
round
hall
and
a
tiny
on
the
ground
floor
her
husband
and
her
family
including
an
adorable
child
of
two
were
all
as
amiable
as
possible
peter
told
her
most
things
on
the
first
day
that
he
had
tea
with
her
and
everything
on
the
second
he
told
her
about
his
boyhood
treliss
scaw
house
his
father
stephen
he
told
her
about
brockett
and
bucket
lane
he
told
her
finally
about
clare
rossiter
he
always
remembered
one
thing
that
she
said
at
this
time
they
were
sitting
at
her
open
window
looking
down
into
the
blue
evening
that
is
in
westminster
quieter
even
than
it
is
at
chelsea
behind
the
faint
green
cloud
of
trees
the
abbey
huge
black
pile
soared
into
space
you
think
you
made
a
tremendous
break
she
said
yes
this
is
an
entirely
new
life
new
in
every
way
i
seem
too
to
be
set
amongst
an
entirely
new
crowd
of
people
the
division
seems
to
me
sharper
every
day
i
believe
i
left
it
all
she
looked
at
him
sharply
you
afraid
of
all
that
earlier
time
she
said
yes
i
it
made
you
write
hallard
perhaps
this
life
here
in
london
it
safer
he
caught
her
up
do
she
answered
him
very
gravely
play
for
safety
it
the
most
dangerous
thing
in
the
she
paused
for
a
moment
and
then
added
but
probably
they
wo
let
you
i
hope
to
god
they
will
he
cried
iii
he
saw
clare
rossiter
twice
during
this
time
and
on
each
occasion
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
was
trying
to
make
up
to
him
for
his
awkwardness
at
their
first
meeting
on
the
first
of
these
two
occasions
she
had
only
a
few
words
with
him
but
there
was
a
note
in
her
voice
that
he
fancied
wildly
unreasonably
was
different
from
the
tone
that
she
used
to
other
people
she
looked
so
beautiful
with
her
golden
hair
coiled
above
her
head
it
was
the
most
wonderful
gold
that
he
had
ever
seen
he
could
only
in
his
excitement
think
of
marmalade
and
that
was
a
sticky
comparison
the
lady
with
the
marmalade
hair
how
monstrous
but
that
did
convey
the
colour
her
eyes
seemed
darker
now
than
they
had
been
before
and
her
cheeks
whiter
the
curve
of
her
neck
was
so
wonderful
that
it
hurt
him
physically
he
wanted
so
terribly
to
kiss
her
just
beneath
her
ear
he
saw
how
he
would
do
it
and
that
he
would
have
to
move
away
some
of
the
shiny
hair
that
strayed
like
sunlight
across
the
white
skin
she
did
not
seem
to
him
quite
so
tiny
when
she
smiled
it
was
exactly
as
water
ripples
when
the
sun
suddenly
bursts
dark
clouds
he
had
a
thousand
comparisons
for
her
and
then
sometimes
she
would
be
as
it
were
caught
up
into
a
cloud
and
he
would
only
see
a
general
radiance
and
be
blinded
by
the
light
he
wished
very
much
that
he
could
think
of
something
else
something
other
than
marmalade
that
had
that
quality
of
gold
he
often
imagined
what
it
would
be
like
when
she
let
it
all
down
like
a
forest
of
autumn
trees
no
that
spoke
of
decay
like
the
sunlight
on
sand
towards
evening
like
the
fires
of
walhalla
in
the
last
act
of
gotterdämmerung
like
the
lights
of
some
harbour
seen
from
the
farther
shore
like
clouds
that
are
ready
to
burst
with
evening
sunlight
perhaps
after
all
amber
was
the
nearest
peter
ask
miss
rossiter
if
she
will
have
some
more
tea
oh
what
a
fool
he
is
what
an
absolute
ass
on
the
second
of
these
two
meetings
she
had
read
reuben
she
loved
it
she
thought
it
astounding
the
most
wonderful
first
novel
she
had
ever
read
how
had
he
been
able
to
make
one
feel
cornwall
so
she
had
been
once
to
cornwall
to
mullion
and
it
had
been
just
like
that
those
rocks
it
was
like
a
poem
and
then
so
exciting
she
had
not
been
able
to
put
it
down
for
a
single
minute
mother
was
furious
with
me
because
there
i
sat
until
i
do
know
how
early
in
the
morning
reading
it
oh
westcott
how
wonderful
to
write
like
that
her
praise
inflamed
him
like
wine
he
looked
at
her
with
exultation
oh
you
feel
like
that
he
said
drawing
a
great
breath
i
did
want
you
to
like
it
so
he
was
enraptured
the
world
was
heaven
he
did
not
realise
that
some
young
woman
at
a
the
day
before
had
said
precisely
these
same
things
and
he
had
said
of
all
the
affected
idiots
iv
this
might
all
be
termed
a
period
of
preparation
that
period
was
fixed
for
peter
with
its
sign
and
seal
on
a
certain
evening
of
spring
when
an
enormous
orange
moon
was
in
the
sky
scents
were
in
all
the
chelsea
gardens
and
the
chelsea
streets
were
like
glass
in
the
silver
luminous
light
peter
was
walking
home
after
a
party
at
the
rossiters
it
was
the
first
time
that
he
had
been
invited
to
their
house
and
it
had
been
a
great
success
rossiter
was
a
little
round
fat
man
with
hair
red
cheeks
and
twinkling
eyes
he
cured
his
patients
and
irritated
his
relations
by
his
good
temper
rossiter
peter
thought
had
a
great
resemblance
to
bobby
mother
galleon
senior
they
were
both
of
them
massive
and
phlegmatic
they
had
both
acquired
that
solemn
dignity
that
comes
of
living
up
to
one
husband
reputation
they
both
looked
on
their
families
rossiter
on
clare
and
galleon
on
millicent
percival
and
bobby
with
curiosity
tolerance
and
a
mild
soft
of
wonder
they
were
both
massively
happy
and
completely
unimaginative
they
were
indeed
old
friends
having
been
at
school
together
they
were
emma
and
jane
to
one
another
and
rossiter
could
never
forget
that
galleon
came
to
school
two
years
after
herself
and
was
therefore
junior
still
whilst
galleon
had
stayed
two
years
longer
than
rossiter
and
was
a
power
there
when
rossiter
was
completely
forgotten
they
were
fond
of
each
other
as
long
as
they
were
allowed
to
patronise
one
another
peter
had
spent
a
delicious
evening
he
had
had
half
an
hour
in
the
garden
with
clare
they
had
spoken
in
an
undertone
he
had
told
her
his
ambitions
she
had
told
him
her
aspirations
some
one
had
sung
in
the
garden
and
there
had
been
one
wonderful
moment
when
peter
had
touched
her
hand
and
she
had
not
taken
it
away
at
last
they
were
both
silent
and
the
garden
flowed
about
them
on
every
side
of
them
with
the
notes
and
threads
that
can
only
be
heard
at
night
rossiter
heavily
and
solemnly
brought
her
daughter
a
shawl
there
was
some
one
to
whom
she
would
like
to
introduce
westcott
would
he
mind
eden
was
robbed
of
its
glories
but
he
had
had
enough
he
thought
at
one
moment
that
already
she
was
beginning
to
care
for
him
and
at
another
that
a
lover
fancy
made
signs
out
of
the
wind
and
portents
out
of
the
running
water
but
he
was
happy
with
a
mighty
exultation
and
then
as
he
turned
down
on
to
the
embankment
and
felt
the
breeze
from
the
river
as
it
came
towards
him
he
met
henry
galleon
the
old
man
in
an
enormous
hat
that
was
like
a
top
hat
only
round
at
the
brim
and
brown
in
colour
was
trotting
home
he
saw
peter
and
stopped
he
spoke
to
him
in
his
slow
tremendous
voice
and
the
words
seemed
to
go
on
after
they
had
left
him
rolling
along
the
embankment
i
am
glad
to
see
you
westcott
i
have
thought
that
i
would
like
to
have
a
chat
with
you
i
have
just
finished
your
this
was
indeed
tremendous
that
henry
galleon
should
have
read
reuben
peter
trembled
all
over
i
wonder
whether
you
would
care
to
come
and
have
a
chat
with
me
i
have
some
things
you
might
care
to
see
what
time
like
the
present
it
is
early
hours
yet
and
you
will
be
doing
an
old
man
who
sleeps
only
poorly
a
what
a
night
of
nights
peter
trembling
with
excitement
felt
henry
galleon
put
his
arm
in
his
felt
the
weight
of
the
great
man
body
they
walked
slowly
along
and
the
moon
and
the
stars
and
the
lights
on
the
river
and
the
early
little
leaves
in
the
trees
and
the
stones
of
the
houses
and
the
little
of
the
water
against
the
embankment
seemed
to
say
oh
peter
westcott
going
to
have
a
chat
with
henry
galleon
did
you
ever
hear
such
a
thing
peter
was
sorry
that
his
embankment
was
deserted
and
that
there
was
no
one
to
see
them
go
into
the
house
together
he
drew
a
great
breath
as
the
door
closed
behind
them
the
house
was
large
and
dark
and
mysterious
the
rest
of
the
family
were
still
out
at
some
party
henry
galleon
drew
peter
into
his
own
especial
quarters
and
soon
they
were
sitting
in
a
lofty
library
its
walls
covered
with
books
that
stretched
to
the
ceiling
peter
meanwhile
buried
in
a
huge
and
feeling
that
henry
galleon
eyes
were
piercing
him
through
and
through
the
old
man
talked
for
some
time
about
other
things
talked
wonderfully
about
the
great
ones
of
the
earth
whom
he
had
known
the
great
things
that
he
had
seen
it
was
amazing
to
peter
to
hear
the
gods
of
his
world
alluded
to
as
poor
old
s
poor
fellow
yes
indeed
i
remember
his
coming
into
breakfast
one
day
or
you
were
asking
about
t
old
wallie
as
we
used
to
call
him
poor
fellow
poor
fellow
we
lived
together
in
rooms
for
some
time
that
was
before
i
married
and
perilously
dangerously
i
might
almost
say
magnificently
near
starvation
we
were
too
peter
already
inflamed
with
that
earlier
in
the
garden
now
breathed
a
portentous
air
he
was
with
the
gods
there
on
the
olympian
heights
he
drank
with
them
he
sang
songs
with
them
with
mighty
voices
they
applauded
reuben
he
drank
in
his
excitement
many
whiskies
and
sodas
and
soon
the
white
room
with
its
books
was
like
the
inside
of
a
golden
shell
the
old
man
opposite
him
grew
in
size
his
face
was
ever
larger
and
larger
his
shirt
front
bulged
and
bulged
his
hand
raised
to
emphasise
some
point
was
tremendous
as
the
hand
of
a
god
peter
felt
that
he
himself
was
growing
smaller
and
smaller
would
soon
in
the
depths
of
that
mighty
disappear
altogether
but
that
opposite
him
two
mighty
burning
eyes
held
him
and
always
like
thunder
the
voice
rolled
on
my
son
tells
me
that
this
book
of
yours
is
a
success
that
they
are
emptying
their
purses
to
fill
yours
that
may
be
a
dangerous
thing
for
you
i
have
read
your
book
it
has
many
faults
it
is
not
written
at
all
it
is
loose
and
lacking
in
all
construction
you
know
nothing
as
yet
about
life
you
do
not
know
what
to
use
or
what
to
reject
but
the
spirit
is
there
the
right
spirit
it
is
a
little
flame
it
will
be
very
easily
quenched
and
nothing
can
kill
it
so
easily
as
success
guard
it
my
son
guard
peter
felt
as
siegfried
must
have
felt
when
confronted
by
wotan
his
poor
little
book
was
dwindling
now
before
his
eyes
he
was
conscious
of
a
great
despair
how
useless
of
him
to
attempt
so
impossible
a
task
the
voice
rolled
on
i
am
an
old
man
now
and
only
twice
before
in
my
time
nave
i
seen
that
spirit
in
a
young
man
eyes
you
may
remember
now
an
old
words
for
i
would
urge
you
i
would
implore
you
to
keep
nothing
before
you
but
the
one
thing
that
can
bring
life
into
art
i
will
not
speak
to
you
of
the
sacredness
of
your
calling
many
will
laugh
at
you
and
tell
you
that
it
is
pretentious
to
name
it
so
others
will
come
to
you
and
will
advise
how
this
is
to
be
done
and
that
is
to
be
done
others
will
talk
to
you
of
schools
they
will
tell
you
that
once
it
was
in
that
manner
and
that
now
it
is
in
this
manner
some
will
tell
you
that
you
have
no
style
others
will
tell
you
that
you
have
too
much
some
again
will
tempt
you
with
money
and
money
is
not
to
be
despised
again
you
will
be
tested
with
photographs
and
paragraphs
with
lectures
and
public
dinners
worst
of
all
there
will
come
to
you
terrible
hours
when
you
yourself
know
of
a
sure
certainty
that
your
work
is
worthless
in
your
middle
age
a
great
barrenness
will
come
upon
you
you
have
been
a
little
teller
of
little
tales
and
on
every
side
of
you
there
will
be
others
who
have
striven
for
other
prizes
and
have
won
them
sitting
alone
in
your
room
with
your
poor
strands
of
coloured
silk
that
had
once
been
intended
to
make
so
beautiful
a
pattern
poor
boy
you
will
know
that
you
have
failed
that
will
be
a
very
dreadful
hour
the
only
power
that
can
meet
it
is
a
blind
and
deaf
courage
courage
is
the
only
thing
that
we
are
here
to
show
the
hour
will
the
old
man
paused
there
was
a
silence
then
he
said
very
slowly
as
though
he
were
drawing
in
front
of
him
the
earliest
histories
of
his
own
past
life
against
all
these
temptations
against
these
voices
of
the
world
and
the
flesh
against
the
glory
of
power
and
the
swinging
hammer
of
success
you
sitting
quietly
in
your
room
must
remember
that
a
great
charge
has
been
given
you
that
you
are
here
for
one
thing
and
one
thing
only
to
listen
the
whole
duty
of
art
is
listening
for
the
voice
of
god
i
am
not
speaking
in
phrases
i
am
not
pressing
upon
you
any
sensational
discoveries
but
here
at
the
end
of
my
long
life
i
with
all
the
things
that
i
meant
to
do
and
have
failed
to
do
heavy
upon
me
can
give
you
only
this
one
word
i
have
hurried
i
have
scrambled
i
have
fought
and
cursed
and
striven
but
as
an
artist
only
those
hours
that
i
have
spent
listening
waiting
have
been
my
real
life
so
it
must
be
with
you
you
are
here
to
listen
never
mind
if
they
tell
you
that
is
a
cheap
thing
a
popular
thing
a
mean
thing
it
is
the
instrument
that
is
given
to
you
and
if
when
you
come
to
die
you
know
that
for
brief
moments
you
have
heard
and
that
what
you
have
heard
you
have
written
life
has
been
justified
nothing
else
can
console
you
nothing
else
can
comfort
you
there
must
be
restraint
austerity
discipline
words
must
come
to
you
easily
but
only
because
life
has
come
to
you
with
so
great
a
pain
the
life
is
the
harshest
that
god
can
give
to
a
man
make
no
mistake
about
that
fortitude
is
the
artist
only
weapon
of
defence
henry
galleon
came
over
to
peter
chair
and
put
his
hand
upon
the
arm
i
am
at
the
end
of
my
work
i
have
done
what
i
can
you
are
at
the
beginning
of
yours
you
will
do
what
you
can
i
wish
you
good
a
vision
came
to
peter
through
the
open
window
against
the
sheet
of
stars
gigantic
was
the
rider
on
the
lion
he
could
not
see
the
rider
face
a
great
exultation
inflamed
him
at
that
instant
he
was
stripped
bare
his
history
the
people
whom
he
knew
the
things
that
he
had
done
they
were
all
as
though
they
had
never
been
his
soul
was
for
that
great
moment
naked
and
alone
before
god
the
whole
duty
of
art
is
listening
for
the
voice
of
god
a
sound
as
though
it
came
to
him
from
another
world
broke
into
the
room
there
were
voices
and
steps
on
the
stairs
ah
they
are
back
from
their
party
henry
galleon
said
trotting
happily
to
the
door
come
up
and
have
a
chat
with
my
wife
westcott
before
going
to
chapter
iii
the
encounter
i
peter
was
now
the
young
man
of
the
moment
he
took
this
elevation
with
frank
delight
was
encouraged
by
it
gave
it
all
rather
more
perhaps
than
its
actual
value
began
a
new
novel
the
stone
house
started
weekly
reviewing
on
and
yielded
himself
up
entirely
to
clare
rossiter
he
had
been
in
love
with
her
ever
since
that
first
day
at
norah
monogue
but
the
way
that
she
gradually
now
absorbed
him
was
like
nothing
so
much
as
the
slow
covering
of
the
rocks
and
the
sand
by
the
incoming
tide
at
first
in
those
days
at
brockett
she
had
seemed
to
him
something
mysterious
intangible
holy
but
after
that
meeting
in
cheyne
walk
he
knew
her
for
a
prize
that
some
fortunate
man
might
one
day
win
he
did
not
for
an
instant
suppose
that
he
could
ever
be
that
one
but
the
mere
imagined
picture
of
what
some
other
would
one
day
have
sent
the
blood
rushing
through
him
her
holiness
for
him
was
still
intact
but
for
another
there
would
be
human
earthly
wonders
then
curiously
as
he
met
her
more
often
and
knew
her
better
there
came
a
certain
easy
almost
casual
intercourse
one
clare
rossiter
still
reigned
amongst
the
clouds
but
there
was
now
too
another
easy
fascinating
humorous
creature
who
treated
him
almost
like
alice
galleon
herself
laughed
at
him
teased
him
provoked
him
suddenly
like
a
shadow
across
a
screen
would
slip
away
and
he
be
on
his
knees
again
before
something
that
was
only
to
be
worshipped
these
two
shapes
of
her
crossed
and
were
confused
and
again
were
parted
his
thoughts
were
first
worshipping
in
heaven
then
dwelling
with
delight
on
witty
charming
things
that
she
had
said
for
that
man
when
he
came
there
would
be
a
most
wonderful
treasure
peter
now
lost
his
appetite
he
could
not
sleep
at
night
he
would
slip
out
of
his
room
cross
the
silent
chelsea
streets
and
watch
her
dark
window
he
cultivated
rossiter
and
that
massive
and
complacent
lady
took
it
entirely
to
herself
indeed
nothing
at
this
time
was
more
remarkable
than
the
little
stir
that
peter
devotion
caused
it
was
perhaps
that
clare
had
always
had
a
cloud
of
young
men
about
her
perhaps
that
peter
was
thought
to
be
having
too
wonderful
a
time
just
now
to
be
falling
in
love
as
well
that
would
be
piling
life
on
to
life
no
one
could
live
under
it
besides
rossiter
liked
him
he
was
amazing
you
see
people
said
and
the
next
stage
arrived
one
may
evening
at
the
galleons
house
when
some
one
was
playing
the
piano
and
all
the
world
seemed
to
be
sitting
in
corners
clare
hand
lay
suddenly
against
his
the
smooth
outer
curve
of
his
hand
lay
against
her
palm
their
little
fingers
touched
sheets
of
fire
rose
inflamed
him
and
fell
rose
again
and
fell
his
hand
began
to
shake
her
hand
began
to
shake
he
heard
a
thousand
miles
away
some
one
singing
about
the
their
hands
parted
she
rose
and
slowly
her
white
dress
and
hair
flung
against
a
background
that
seemed
to
him
black
and
infinite
crossed
the
room
that
trembling
of
her
hand
had
maddened
him
it
suddenly
showed
him
that
he
as
well
as
another
might
run
the
race
for
her
everything
that
he
had
ever
done
or
been
his
sentiments
his
grossnesses
his
restraints
and
his
rebellions
were
now
concerned
in
this
pursuit
no
other
human
being
stephen
norah
monogue
bobby
alice
now
had
any
interest
for
him
his
reviews
were
written
he
knew
not
how
the
editions
of
reuben
hallard
might
run
into
the
gross
for
all
he
cared
the
stone
house
lay
neglected
and
he
avoided
seeing
her
he
was
afraid
to
spoil
that
moment
when
her
hand
had
shaken
at
the
touch
of
his
and
yet
he
was
tormented
by
the
longing
for
a
new
meeting
that
might
provide
some
new
amazement
perhaps
he
would
hold
her
hand
and
feel
the
shadow
of
her
body
bending
towards
his
own
and
his
heart
stopped
beating
and
he
was
suddenly
cold
with
a
splendid
terror
then
he
did
meet
her
again
and
had
nothing
to
say
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
was
frightened
he
came
home
that
day
in
a
cold
fog
of
miserable
despair
a
letter
from
his
publishers
informing
him
of
a
tenth
edition
was
of
ironical
unimportance
he
lay
awake
all
night
restlessly
unhappy
for
the
first
time
for
many
months
the
old
shadows
stole
out
into
the
room
the
black
bulk
of
scaw
house
the
trees
the
windows
his
father
and
to
him
tossing
on
his
bed
there
came
thoughts
of
a
certain
house
in
the
town
he
could
get
up
and
dress
now
a
cab
would
soon
take
him
there
in
the
early
morning
he
could
slink
back
clare
did
not
want
him
a
fool
to
fancy
that
she
had
ever
cared
he
peter
westcott
nobody
why
then
should
he
not
have
his
adventures
he
still
so
young
and
vigorous
he
would
go
to
that
house
and
then
almost
reluctantly
as
he
sat
up
in
bed
and
watched
the
grey
shadowy
walls
stephen
seemed
to
be
visible
to
him
stephen
walking
the
road
starting
early
in
the
fresh
air
when
the
light
was
breaking
and
the
scent
of
the
grass
was
cool
and
filled
with
dew
he
would
write
to
stephen
in
the
morning
he
lay
down
and
went
to
sleep
by
this
time
meanwhile
alice
and
bobby
had
noticed
alice
indeed
had
a
number
of
young
men
over
whose
emotions
she
kept
guard
and
peter
had
become
during
these
weeks
very
valuable
to
her
she
did
not
want
him
to
marry
anybody
especially
she
did
not
want
him
to
marry
clare
at
breakfast
past
peter
ears
as
though
he
were
not
concerned
at
all
she
talked
to
bobby
really
rossiter
spoils
clare
beyond
all
bounds
um
he
taking
her
with
him
up
to
glasgow
to
that
congress
thing
he
knows
perfectly
well
that
she
ought
to
stay
with
rossiter
and
so
does
well
it
no
business
of
ours
bobby
usual
tolerant
complacency
it
is
clare
might
be
a
fine
creature
if
she
did
let
herself
be
spoiled
in
this
way
she
perpetually
selfish
and
she
ought
to
be
told
we
all
perpetually
selfish
said
bobby
who
began
to
be
sorry
for
peter
oh
no
we
not
i
very
fond
of
clare
but
i
do
envy
the
man
who
marries
her
there
no
one
in
the
world
more
delightful
when
she
has
her
own
way
and
things
go
smoothly
but
they
wrapped
her
up
in
cotton
wool
to
such
an
extent
that
she
simply
does
know
how
to
live
out
of
it
she
positively
terrified
of
this
as
alice
had
intended
was
too
much
for
peter
he
burst
out
i
think
miss
rossiter
the
pluckiest
girl
i
ever
met
she
afraid
of
except
of
being
uncomfortable
alice
retorted
that
frightens
her
into
fits
make
her
uncomfortable
peter
and
you
see
and
red
in
the
face
peter
answered
i
do
think
you
ought
to
talk
of
any
one
who
so
fond
of
you
behind
her
back
in
that
way
oh
i
say
just
the
same
to
her
face
i
always
telling
her
these
things
and
she
always
agrees
and
then
just
as
selfish
as
ever
that
absurd
little
father
of
hers
has
spoilt
her
spoilt
clare
spoilt
peter
smiled
darkly
alice
galleon
delightful
woman
though
she
was
of
course
could
endure
that
another
woman
should
receive
such
praise
jealousy
ah
and
the
aged
and
weighty
author
of
reuben
hallard
to
whom
the
world
was
naturally
an
open
book
and
life
known
to
its
foundations
nodded
to
himself
how
people
intelligent
enough
in
other
ways
could
be
so
afterwards
when
they
were
alone
bobby
took
him
in
hand
you
in
love
with
clare
rossiter
peter
he
said
yes
i
am
peter
answered
defiantly
but
you
known
her
so
short
a
time
what
that
to
do
with
it
oh
nothing
of
course
but
do
you
think
you
the
sort
of
people
likely
to
get
on
really
bobby
i
do
i
know
none
of
my
business
quite
true
but
you
see
i
known
clare
pretty
well
all
my
life
and
you
the
best
friend
i
got
so
you
might
allow
me
to
take
an
well
say
what
you
nothing
to
say
except
that
clare
is
altogether
an
easy
problem
you
like
all
the
other
fellows
i
know
think
because
clare
got
red
hair
and
laughs
easily
she
a
goddess
she
is
not
a
bit
she
got
magnificent
qualities
and
one
day
perhaps
when
she
had
a
thoroughly
bad
time
she
show
one
the
kind
of
things
she
made
of
but
she
an
only
child
she
been
spoilt
all
her
life
and
the
moment
she
begins
to
be
unhappy
she
she
sha
ever
be
unhappy
if
i
can
help
it
muttered
peter
fiercely
bobby
laughed
you
do
your
best
of
course
but
are
you
the
sort
of
man
for
her
she
wants
some
one
who
give
her
every
kind
of
comfort
moral
physical
and
intellectual
she
wants
somebody
who
accept
her
enthusiasms
as
genuine
intelligence
you
find
her
out
intellectually
in
a
week
then
she
wants
some
one
who
give
her
his
whole
attention
you
think
now
that
you
will
but
you
wo
you
ca
you
not
made
that
way
by
temperament
and
trade
you
an
artist
she
thinks
at
the
moment
that
an
artist
would
suit
her
very
well
but
in
reality
my
boy
he
the
very
last
sort
of
person
she
ought
to
peter
caught
at
bobby
words
do
you
really
think
she
cares
about
me
she
interested
clare
spends
her
days
in
successive
enthusiasms
she
always
being
enthusiastic
dreadful
disillusions
in
between
the
heights
mind
you
there
another
side
of
clare
a
splendid
side
but
it
wants
very
careful
management
and
i
do
know
peter
that
exactly
the
sort
of
person
thanks
very
much
said
peter
grimly
no
but
you
not
you
do
in
the
least
see
her
as
she
is
and
she
does
see
you
as
you
are
hence
these
misguided
attempts
on
my
part
to
show
you
one
but
peter
had
not
been
listening
do
you
really
think
he
muttered
that
she
cares
about
me
bobby
looked
at
him
laughed
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
in
despair
ah
i
see
it
no
use
he
said
poor
dear
peter
well
i
wish
you
luck
and
that
was
the
end
as
far
as
alice
and
bobby
were
concerned
they
never
alluded
to
it
again
and
indeed
now
seemed
to
favour
meetings
between
clare
and
peter
and
now
through
these
wonderful
spring
weeks
these
two
were
continually
together
the
galleons
had
at
first
been
inclined
to
consider
clare
obvious
preference
for
peter
as
the
simplest
desire
to
be
part
of
a
general
rather
heady
enthusiasm
clare
loves
little
movements
and
peter
throughout
this
spring
was
a
little
movement
the
weeks
went
on
and
clare
was
not
herself
silent
absorbed
almost
morose
one
day
she
asked
alice
galleon
a
number
of
questions
about
peter
and
after
that
resolutely
avoided
speaking
of
him
of
course
alice
said
to
bobby
dr
rossiter
will
let
her
marry
any
one
she
likes
she
have
plenty
of
money
and
peter
going
to
have
a
great
career
after
all
it
may
be
the
best
bobby
shook
his
head
they
both
egoists
he
said
peter
because
he
never
had
anything
he
wanted
and
clare
because
she
always
had
everything
it
wo
but
after
all
when
may
gave
place
to
burning
june
bobby
and
alice
were
inevitably
drawn
into
that
romance
they
yielded
to
an
atmosphere
that
both
by
temperament
were
too
sentimental
to
resist
nearer
and
nearer
was
coming
that
intoxicating
moment
of
peter
final
plunge
and
clare
beautiful
these
weeks
with
all
the
excitement
of
the
wonderful
episode
saw
him
as
a
young
god
who
had
leapt
upon
a
submissive
london
and
conquered
it
rossiter
and
galleon
played
waiting
chorus
launce
from
her
little
house
in
westminster
was
as
usual
glowing
with
a
piece
of
other
people
happiness
bobby
and
alice
had
surrendered
to
the
atmosphere
all
were
of
course
silent
until
the
word
is
spoken
no
movement
must
be
made
the
little
god
is
so
easily
alarmed
at
last
towards
the
close
of
this
hot
june
launce
proposed
to
clare
a
at
her
sussex
cottage
by
the
sea
she
also
told
peter
that
she
could
put
him
up
if
he
chose
to
come
down
at
the
same
time
what
could
be
more
delightful
in
this
weather
dear
clare
only
the
tiniest
cottage
as
you
know
no
one
else
unless
peter
westcott
happens
to
come
down
i
suggested
it
and
you
can
see
the
sea
from
your
window
and
there
a
common
and
a
donkey
and
you
can
roll
in
the
sand
launce
when
she
was
very
happy
betrayed
her
french
descent
by
the
delightful
way
that
she
rolled
her
r
not
a
soul
anywhere
near
we
can
bathe
all
clare
would
love
to
come
so
strangely
enough
would
peter
the
train
then
saturday
dear
launce
in
her
bonnet
and
blue
silk
clare
had
never
thought
her
so
entirely
delightful
peter
of
course
plainly
understood
the
things
that
dear
launce
intended
his
confidence
in
her
had
been
in
no
way
misplaced
she
loved
a
wedding
and
was
the
only
person
in
the
world
who
could
bring
to
its
making
so
fine
a
compound
of
sentiment
and
common
sense
she
frankly
loved
it
all
and
though
at
the
moment
occupied
with
the
work
of
at
least
a
dozen
women
and
with
a
family
that
needed
her
most
earnest
care
she
hastened
to
assist
the
idyll
peter
own
feelings
were
curiously
confused
he
was
going
to
propose
to
clare
and
now
he
seemed
to
face
suddenly
the
change
that
this
must
mean
to
him
those
earlier
months
when
it
had
been
pursuit
with
no
certainty
of
capture
had
only
shown
him
one
thing
desirable
clare
but
now
that
he
was
face
to
face
with
it
he
was
frightened
what
did
he
know
of
women
on
the
morning
they
were
to
go
down
he
sat
in
his
room
this
terrible
question
confronting
him
no
he
knew
nothing
about
women
he
had
left
his
heroine
very
much
alone
in
reuben
hallard
and
those
occasions
when
he
had
been
obliged
to
bring
her
on
the
stage
had
not
been
too
successful
he
knew
nothing
about
women
there
would
be
things
a
great
many
as
a
married
man
he
would
have
to
change
sometimes
he
was
moody
for
days
together
and
wanted
to
see
no
one
sometimes
he
was
so
completely
absorbed
by
his
work
that
the
real
people
around
him
were
shadows
and
wraiths
these
moods
must
vanish
clare
must
always
find
him
ready
and
cheerful
and
happy
a
dreadful
sense
of
inadequacy
weighed
upon
peter
and
then
at
the
concrete
fact
of
her
actual
presence
at
the
thought
of
her
standing
there
waiting
for
him
wanting
him
his
doubts
left
him
and
he
was
wildly
madly
happy
and
yet
before
he
left
the
room
his
glance
fell
on
his
white
against
its
shining
surface
lay
a
paper
and
on
the
top
sheet
written
the
stone
house
a
novel
chapter
ii
months
ago
he
had
not
touched
it
all
these
last
weeks
and
at
this
moment
he
felt
he
would
never
write
anything
again
he
turned
away
with
a
little
movement
of
irritation
that
morning
he
went
formally
to
rossiter
the
little
man
received
him
smiling
i
want
to
marry
your
daughter
sir
said
peter
you
very
young
said
the
doctor
said
peter
well
if
she
have
you
i
wo
stand
in
your
way
peter
took
the
train
ii
launce
on
sunday
afternoon
from
the
door
of
her
cottage
watched
them
both
strike
across
the
common
towards
the
sea
peter
stocky
walking
as
though
no
force
on
earth
could
upset
his
and
sturdy
balance
clare
with
her
little
body
and
easy
movement
meant
for
this
air
and
sea
and
springing
turf
launce
having
three
magnificent
children
of
her
own
believed
in
the
science
of
eugenics
heart
and
soul
here
before
her
eyes
was
the
right
and
proper
union
talk
about
souls
and
spirit
and
temperament
important
enough
for
the
immediate
two
but
give
nature
flesh
and
bones
with
cleanliness
and
a
good
straight
stock
to
work
on
and
see
what
she
will
do
launce
went
into
the
cottage
again
and
prepared
herself
for
an
announcement
at
she
wiped
her
eyes
before
she
settled
down
to
her
work
loving
both
of
them
the
thought
of
their
happiness
hung
about
her
all
the
afternoon
and
made
her
very
tender
and
forgiving
when
the
little
parlourmaid
arrived
with
a
piece
of
the
blue
and
white
china
smashed
to
atoms
i
ca
think
it
mum
i
was
just
standing
peter
and
clare
crossing
the
common
beheld
the
sea
at
their
feet
it
was
a
hot
misty
afternoon
and
only
the
thin
white
line
of
tiny
curling
waves
crept
out
of
the
haze
on
to
the
gleaming
yellow
sand
behind
them
on
every
side
was
common
and
the
only
habitation
a
small
cottage
nearly
hidden
by
a
black
belt
of
trees
on
their
right
these
black
painted
trees
lay
like
a
blot
of
ink
against
the
blue
sky
sitting
down
on
the
edge
of
the
common
they
looked
on
to
the
yellow
sand
the
air
was
remorselessly
still
as
though
the
world
were
cased
in
iron
somewhere
deep
within
its
silence
its
heart
might
yet
be
beating
but
the
depths
hid
its
reverberation
peter
lay
flat
on
his
back
and
instantly
his
world
was
full
of
clamour
all
about
him
insects
were
stirring
the
thin
stiff
blades
of
grass
were
very
faintly
rustling
a
tiny
blue
butterfly
flew
up
from
the
soil
into
the
bright
air
some
creature
sang
a
little
song
that
sounded
like
the
faint
melody
of
a
spinet
all
praising
the
lord
i
suppose
peter
listened
hymn
and
glory
songs
and
all
the
rest
then
clashing
out
of
the
heart
of
the
sky
the
thought
followed
there
be
a
god
the
tinkling
insect
told
him
so
he
gazed
into
the
great
sheet
of
blue
above
him
so
remote
so
cruel
and
yet
the
tiny
blue
butterfly
flew
without
fear
into
its
very
heart
peter
soul
was
drawn
up
he
swung
he
flew
he
fled
down
below
there
on
the
hard
brown
soil
his
body
lay
dust
to
the
dust
there
dead
amongst
the
singing
insects
he
looked
down
from
his
great
heights
and
saw
his
body
with
its
red
face
and
its
suit
of
blue
and
its
boots
and
here
in
freedom
his
soul
exulted
of
course
there
is
a
god
they
are
praising
him
down
there
the
ground
is
covered
with
creatures
that
are
praising
him
peter
buried
his
eyes
and
instantly
his
soul
came
swinging
down
to
him
found
his
body
again
filled
once
more
his
veins
with
life
and
sound
after
a
vast
silence
he
could
hear
once
more
the
life
amongst
the
grass
the
faint
rustle
of
the
thin
line
of
foam
beneath
him
and
could
smell
the
earth
and
the
scent
of
the
seaweed
borne
up
to
them
from
the
sand
it
so
still
he
said
suddenly
that
it
almost
like
thunder
there
be
a
storm
later
on
a
day
like
this
in
cornwall
you
would
hear
the
sound
of
the
mining
stamps
for
miles
well
she
answered
i
am
glad
we
not
in
cornwall
i
hate
hate
it
yes
that
sounds
horrible
to
you
i
suppose
and
i
quite
ready
to
admit
that
it
my
cowardice
cornwall
frightens
me
when
i
was
there
as
a
tiny
girl
it
was
just
the
same
i
always
hated
i
do
believe
you
ever
frightened
at
i
am
i
under
such
a
disadvantage
you
see
if
i
been
and
haggard
every
one
would
have
thought
it
quite
natural
that
i
should
scream
if
i
were
left
in
the
dark
or
hate
being
left
alone
with
those
horrible
black
rocks
that
cornwall
so
full
of
but
just
because
healthy
and
was
taught
to
hold
my
back
up
at
school
i
have
to
pretend
to
a
bravery
that
simply
does
exist
he
rejected
for
the
moment
the
last
part
of
her
sentence
oh
but
i
understand
perfectly
what
you
mean
by
your
fear
of
cornwall
of
course
i
understand
it
although
i
love
the
place
with
all
my
soul
and
body
but
it
is
terrifying
almost
the
only
terrifying
place
that
civilisation
has
left
to
us
central
africa
is
nothing
to
it
are
you
afraid
of
it
she
said
looking
at
him
intently
tremendously
because
i
suppose
it
wo
let
me
alone
it
difficult
to
put
into
words
but
i
think
what
i
mean
is
that
i
want
to
go
on
now
in
london
writing
and
seeing
people
and
being
happy
and
it
pulling
at
me
all
the
what
way
pulling
at
you
i
ca
get
out
of
my
head
all
the
things
i
did
when
i
was
a
boy
there
i
was
very
happy
you
know
i
told
you
something
about
it
i
want
to
go
back
i
want
to
go
back
i
must
but
i
want
to
go
back
and
it
hurts
he
seemed
to
have
forgotten
her
he
stared
out
to
sea
his
hands
holding
the
grass
on
either
side
of
him
she
moved
and
the
sound
suddenly
brought
him
back
he
turned
to
her
laughing
sorry
i
was
thinking
about
things
that
cottage
over
there
with
the
black
trees
reminded
me
of
scaw
house
a
little
but
it
all
right
really
i
suppose
every
fellow
has
the
wild
side
and
the
sober
side
and
i
had
such
a
rum
life
and
been
civilised
so
short
a
time
she
said
slowly
i
think
i
know
what
you
mean
though
i
know
enough
of
it
to
be
frightened
of
it
i
do
want
life
to
be
like
that
i
suppose
i
got
imagination
i
want
it
to
be
orderly
and
easy
and
no
one
to
be
hurt
or
damaged
oh
her
voice
was
suddenly
like
a
cry
why
ca
we
just
go
through
life
without
any
one
being
frightened
or
made
miserable
i
in
cities
and
walls
and
fires
and
regulated
emotions
all
those
other
things
can
only
they
teach
courage
peter
answered
gravely
and
that
about
the
only
thing
we
here
to
learn
i
expect
my
mother
died
because
she
brave
enough
and
i
want
i
want
he
broke
off
there
only
one
thing
i
want
and
that
you
clare
you
must
have
known
all
these
weeks
that
i
love
you
i
loved
you
ever
since
i
met
you
that
good
friday
afternoon
years
ago
let
me
take
care
of
you
see
that
no
one
hurts
you
love
you
love
you
do
you
really
want
me
peter
he
did
speak
but
his
whole
body
turned
towards
her
answered
her
question
because
i
am
yours
entirely
i
became
yours
that
day
when
your
hand
touched
mine
i
was
sure
before
i
knew
then
he
looked
at
her
he
saw
her
he
thought
for
the
first
time
she
sat
with
her
hands
pressing
on
the
grass
her
body
bent
back
a
little
the
curve
from
her
neck
to
her
feet
was
like
the
shadow
of
some
colour
against
the
brown
earth
because
he
saw
her
only
dimly
her
hair
burnt
against
the
blue
sky
but
her
eyes
her
eyes
his
gaze
caught
hers
and
he
surrendered
himself
to
that
tenderness
that
mystery
that
passion
that
she
flung
about
him
in
her
eyes
he
saw
what
only
a
lover
can
see
the
terror
and
the
splendour
of
a
soul
surprised
for
the
first
time
into
love
she
was
caught
she
was
trapped
she
was
gorgeously
delivered
in
her
eyes
he
saw
that
he
had
her
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
and
that
she
was
glad
to
be
there
but
even
now
they
had
not
touched
they
had
not
moved
from
their
places
they
were
urged
towards
one
another
by
some
fierce
power
but
also
some
great
suspense
still
restrained
them
then
clare
spoke
hurriedly
almost
pleadingly
but
peter
listen
before
i
say
any
more
you
must
know
me
better
i
think
that
it
is
just
because
i
love
you
so
much
that
i
see
myself
clearly
as
i
have
never
seen
myself
before
although
i
have
i
suppose
really
known
things
but
i
have
denied
them
to
myself
but
now
i
know
that
all
that
i
say
is
true
i
am
ready
he
said
smiling
but
she
did
not
smile
back
at
him
she
was
intensely
serious
she
spoke
without
moving
her
eyes
from
his
face
it
is
not
altogether
my
fault
i
have
been
an
only
child
and
everything
that
i
have
wanted
i
have
always
had
i
have
despised
my
mother
and
even
my
father
because
they
have
given
in
to
me
that
is
not
a
pleasant
thing
to
know
and
now
comfort
happiness
an
absence
of
all
misery
these
things
are
essential
i
will
look
after
you
said
peter
it
was
almost
with
irritation
that
she
brushed
aside
his
assurance
yes
yes
i
know
but
you
must
understand
that
it
more
than
that
if
i
am
unhappy
i
am
another
creature
you
have
seen
you
know
if
i
am
frightened
but
clare
dear
we
all
like
that
no
it
sheer
wickedness
with
me
oh
peter
i
love
you
so
much
that
you
listen
you
must
think
afterwards
ah
if
i
only
known
are
you
making
too
much
of
it
all
we
all
got
these
things
and
it
just
because
we
can
help
each
other
that
we
marry
we
give
each
the
courage
i
always
been
frightened
she
said
slowly
always
when
anything
big
comes
along
always
and
this
is
the
biggest
thing
i
ever
met
if
only
it
had
been
some
ordinary
man
but
you
peter
that
i
should
hurt
you
wo
hurt
me
he
answered
her
and
i
rather
be
hurt
by
you
than
helped
by
some
one
else
let
leave
all
this
if
you
love
me
there
nothing
else
to
say
do
you
love
me
clare
yes
then
suddenly
before
he
could
move
towards
her
a
storm
that
had
been
creeping
upon
them
burst
over
their
heads
five
minutes
ago
there
had
been
no
sign
of
anything
but
the
finest
weather
but
in
a
moment
the
black
clouds
had
rolled
up
and
the
thunder
broke
clashing
upon
the
world
the
sea
had
vanished
we
must
run
for
it
cried
peter
raising
his
voice
against
the
storm
that
cottage
over
there
it
the
only
they
ran
the
common
was
black
now
the
rain
drove
hissing
against
the
soil
the
air
was
hot
with
the
faint
sulphur
smell
peter
flung
himself
upon
the
cottage
door
and
clare
followed
him
in
for
a
moment
they
stood
breathless
then
peter
conscious
only
that
clare
was
beside
him
wild
with
the
excitement
of
the
storm
caught
her
held
her
for
a
moment
away
from
him
breathed
the
thunder
that
was
about
them
all
and
then
kissed
her
mouth
wet
with
the
rain
she
clung
to
him
white
breathless
her
head
on
his
shoulder
why
you
not
frightened
the
sense
of
her
helplessness
filled
him
with
a
delicious
vigour
the
way
that
her
hand
pressed
in
upon
his
shoulder
exalted
him
her
wet
golden
hair
brushed
his
cheek
then
he
remembered
that
they
had
invaded
the
cottage
for
the
first
time
it
occurred
to
him
that
their
first
embrace
might
have
been
observed
he
turned
around
the
room
was
filthy
a
huge
black
occupied
most
of
it
the
floor
was
littered
with
pieces
of
paper
of
vegetables
and
a
disagreeable
smell
protested
against
the
closed
and
dirty
windows
at
first
it
seemed
that
this
place
was
empty
and
then
with
a
start
he
was
aware
that
two
eyes
were
watching
them
the
thunder
pealed
above
them
the
rain
lashed
the
roof
and
ran
streaming
from
the
eaves
the
cottage
was
dark
but
he
saw
in
a
chair
a
bundle
of
rags
from
which
those
eyes
were
staring
clare
gave
a
little
cry
an
old
woman
with
a
fallen
chin
and
a
face
like
yellow
parchment
sat
huddled
in
the
chair
peter
spoke
to
her
i
hope
you
do
mind
our
taking
shelter
here
whilst
the
storm
she
had
seen
them
embrace
it
made
him
uncomfortable
but
the
storm
was
passing
away
already
the
thunder
was
more
distant
the
old
woman
made
no
reply
only
her
eyes
glared
at
them
peter
put
his
hand
in
clare
it
all
right
i
think
the
old
thing
deaf
and
dumb
and
blind
look
the
storm
passing
there
a
bit
of
blue
sky
it
odd
an
old
thing
like
that
clare
shuddered
a
little
i
do
like
it
she
horrid
this
place
is
so
dirty
i
believe
the
rain
they
opened
the
door
and
the
earth
met
them
good
and
sweet
after
the
shower
the
sky
was
breaking
the
mists
were
leaving
the
sea
and
as
the
storm
vanished
the
sun
dipping
towards
the
horizon
flung
upon
the
blue
a
fleet
of
tiny
golden
clouds
peter
bent
down
to
the
old
woman
thank
you
he
said
for
giving
us
he
placed
a
shilling
on
her
lap
she
quite
deaf
and
blind
he
said
poor
old
thing
they
closed
the
door
behind
them
and
passed
down
a
little
path
to
the
seashore
here
wonders
met
them
the
sand
wet
with
the
recent
storm
catching
all
the
colours
of
the
sky
shone
with
mother
of
pearl
here
a
pool
of
blue
there
the
fleet
of
golden
clouds
it
stretched
on
every
side
of
them
blazing
with
colour
behind
them
the
common
sinking
now
into
the
dull
light
of
evening
they
stood
little
pigmies
on
that
vast
painted
floor
before
them
the
breeze
blowing
back
the
waves
into
the
sun
again
turned
the
spray
to
gold
tiny
figures
in
all
this
glory
they
embraced
in
all
the
world
they
seemed
the
only
living
thing
iii
they
had
their
witness
the
old
woman
who
lived
in
the
heart
of
those
black
trees
was
deaf
and
dumb
indeed
but
her
eyes
were
alive
in
her
fading
and
wrinkled
body
when
the
door
had
closed
she
rose
slowly
from
her
chair
and
her
face
was
wrinkled
with
the
passion
of
the
hatred
that
her
old
soul
was
feeling
what
did
they
mean
those
two
coming
there
and
haunting
her
with
their
youth
and
strength
and
love
kissing
there
before
her
as
though
she
were
already
dead
she
to
whom
kisses
were
only
bitter
memories
her
face
worked
with
fury
she
hobbled
painfully
to
the
door
and
opened
it
below
her
on
a
floor
of
gold
two
black
figures
stood
together
gazing
at
them
she
raised
her
thin
and
trembling
hand
she
flung
with
a
passionate
furious
gesture
something
from
her
a
small
silver
coin
glittered
in
the
air
whistled
for
a
moment
and
fell
chapter
iv
the
roundabout
i
rossiter
and
galleon
sat
solemnly
with
the
majesty
of
spreading
skirts
and
sunday
best
hats
in
the
little
of
the
roundabout
awaiting
the
return
from
the
honeymoon
the
roundabout
is
the
name
that
peter
has
given
to
the
little
house
in
dorset
street
chelsea
that
he
has
chosen
to
live
in
with
his
bride
high
spirits
lead
to
nicknames
and
peter
was
in
the
very
highest
of
spirits
when
he
took
the
house
the
name
alluded
both
to
the
shape
round
like
fat
bulging
little
walls
and
to
the
kind
of
life
that
peter
intended
to
lead
all
was
to
be
happiness
life
is
challenged
with
all
the
high
spirits
of
a
truly
happy
ceremony
it
is
indeed
a
tiny
house
tiny
hall
tiny
stairs
tiny
rooms
but
quaint
with
a
little
orchard
behind
it
and
that
strange
painted
house
that
old
mad
miss
anderson
lives
in
on
the
other
side
of
the
orchard
such
a
quiet
little
street
too
a
line
of
the
gravest
trees
cobbles
with
only
the
most
occasional
cart
and
a
little
church
with
a
sleepy
bell
at
the
farthest
end
all
was
to
be
happiness
wedding
presents
there
had
been
six
hundred
or
so
filled
the
rooms
people
had
on
the
whole
been
sensible
had
given
the
right
thing
the
little
with
its
grey
roses
in
blue
jars
its
two
pictures
velasquez
maria
theresa
in
an
old
silver
frame
and
rembrandt
night
watch
was
pleasant
but
overwhelmed
now
by
the
presence
of
these
two
enormous
ladies
the
evening
sun
flooding
it
all
with
yellow
light
was
impertinent
enough
to
blind
the
eyes
of
rossiter
she
rose
and
moved
slowly
to
draw
down
the
blinds
a
little
silver
clock
struck
four
they
must
soon
be
here
said
galleon
gloomily
her
gloom
was
happy
and
comfortable
she
was
making
the
very
most
of
a
pleasant
business
with
the
greatest
satisfaction
in
the
world
she
had
done
exactly
the
same
at
bobby
wedding
and
in
her
heavy
determined
way
she
would
do
the
same
again
before
she
died
alice
galleon
would
be
there
in
a
moment
meantime
the
two
ladies
without
moving
in
their
chairs
flung
sentences
across
at
one
another
and
smoothed
their
silk
skirts
with
their
white
plump
hands
it
not
really
a
healthy
house
no
with
the
orchard
and
it
much
too
small
poor
dears
hope
they
be
happy
but
one
ca
help
feeling
jane
dear
that
it
was
a
little
rash
of
you
your
only
girl
and
one
knows
so
little
about
westcott
really
well
your
own
bobby
vouched
for
him
he
known
him
at
school
after
all
and
we
all
know
how
cautious
bobby
is
about
people
besides
emma
no
one
could
have
received
him
more
warmly
yes
oh
of
course
but
still
having
no
family
coming
out
of
nowhere
so
to
speak
well
it
to
be
hoped
they
get
on
i
must
say
that
clare
will
miss
her
home
terribly
it
takes
a
lot
to
make
up
for
that
and
her
father
so
devoted
too
yes
we
must
make
the
best
of
the
sun
light
faded
from
the
room
the
clock
and
the
pictures
stood
out
sharply
against
the
gathering
dusk
two
ladies
filled
the
room
with
their
shadows
and
the
little
fire
clicked
and
rattled
behind
the
murmuring
voices
ii
alice
galleon
burst
in
upon
them
what
not
arrived
yet
the
train
must
be
dreadfully
late
lights
lights
no
do
you
move
mother
she
returned
with
lamps
and
flooded
the
room
with
light
the
ladies
displayed
a
feeble
protest
against
her
exultant
happiness
i
sure
my
dear
i
hope
that
nothing
has
my
dear
mother
what
happen
well
you
never
know
with
these
trains
and
a
honeymoon
too
is
always
rather
a
dangerous
time
i
remember
i
hear
them
alice
cried
and
there
indeed
they
were
to
be
heard
bumping
and
banging
in
the
little
hall
the
door
opened
and
peter
and
clare
radiant
with
happiness
appeared
they
stood
in
the
doorway
side
by
side
clare
in
a
little
white
hat
and
grey
travelling
dress
and
peter
browner
and
stronger
and
squarer
than
ever
all
these
people
filled
the
little
room
there
was
a
crackling
fire
of
conversation
oh
but
we
had
a
splendid
time
no
i
do
think
clare
in
the
least
tired
yes
is
the
house
a
duck
do
we
just
love
being
back
hoping
you
had
caught
colds
besides
we
had
the
easiest
crossing
how
bobby
were
so
afraid
that
something
must
have
happened
rossiter
took
clare
upstairs
to
help
her
to
take
her
hat
off
mother
and
daughter
faced
one
another
clare
flung
herself
into
her
mother
arms
oh
mother
dear
he
wonderful
wonderful
downstairs
alice
watched
peter
critically
she
had
not
realised
until
this
marriage
how
fond
she
had
grown
of
peter
she
had
for
him
very
much
the
feeling
that
bobby
had
a
sense
of
tolerance
and
even
indulgence
for
all
tempers
and
morosities
and
morbidities
she
had
seen
him
on
a
day
like
a
boy
of
eighteen
loving
the
world
and
everything
in
it
having
too
a
curious
inexperience
of
the
things
that
life
might
mean
to
people
unable
apparently
to
see
the
sterner
side
of
life
at
all
and
then
suddenly
that
had
gone
and
given
place
to
a
mood
in
which
no
one
could
help
him
nothing
could
cheer
him
like
saul
he
was
possessed
with
spirits
now
as
he
stood
there
he
looked
not
a
day
more
than
eighteen
happiness
filled
him
with
colour
his
eyes
were
shining
his
mouth
smiling
alice
old
girl
she
splendid
i
could
have
believed
that
life
could
be
so
good
a
curious
weight
was
lifted
from
her
at
his
words
she
did
not
know
what
it
was
that
she
had
dreaded
perhaps
it
had
been
merely
a
sense
that
clare
was
too
young
and
inexperienced
to
manage
so
difficult
a
temperament
as
peter
and
now
after
all
it
seemed
that
she
had
managed
it
but
in
realising
the
relief
that
she
felt
she
realised
too
the
love
that
she
had
for
peter
when
he
was
young
and
happy
the
risks
that
he
ran
seemed
just
as
heavy
as
when
he
was
old
and
miserable
oh
peter
i
so
glad
i
know
she
splendid
oh
i
believe
you
are
going
to
be
happy
yes
he
answered
her
confidently
i
believe
we
are
the
ladies
galleon
rossiter
and
alice
retired
later
on
clare
and
peter
were
coming
into
bobby
for
a
short
time
left
alone
in
their
little
house
he
drew
her
to
the
window
that
overlooked
the
orchard
and
silently
they
gazed
out
at
the
old
friendly
gnarled
and
knotted
tree
and
the
old
thick
that
stretched
sharply
against
the
behind
them
the
fire
crackled
and
the
lamps
shed
their
pleasant
glow
and
that
dear
child
with
the
great
stiff
dress
that
velasquez
painted
smiled
at
them
from
the
wall
peter
gave
a
deep
sigh
of
happiness
our
house
he
said
and
drew
her
very
close
to
him
the
two
of
them
as
they
stood
there
outlined
against
the
window
were
so
young
and
so
pleasant
that
surely
the
gods
would
have
pity
iii
in
the
days
that
followed
he
watched
it
all
with
incredulity
so
swiftly
had
he
been
tossed
it
seemed
from
fate
to
fate
and
so
easily
also
did
he
leave
behind
him
the
things
that
had
weighed
him
down
no
sign
now
of
that
peter
evident
enough
in
the
brockett
days
morose
silent
sometimes
oppressed
by
a
sense
of
unreasoned
catastrophe
stepping
into
his
bookshop
and
out
again
as
though
all
the
world
were
his
enemy
peter
knew
now
that
he
was
loved
he
had
felt
that
precious
quality
on
the
day
that
his
mother
died
he
had
felt
it
sometimes
when
he
had
been
in
stephen
company
but
against
these
isolated
emotions
what
a
world
of
hate
and
bitterness
now
he
felt
clare
affection
on
every
side
of
him
they
had
already
in
so
short
a
time
a
store
of
precious
memories
intimacies
that
they
shared
they
had
been
through
wild
passionate
wonders
together
and
standing
now
two
human
beings
with
casual
words
and
laughing
eyes
yet
they
knew
that
perfect
holy
secrets
bound
them
together
he
stood
sometimes
in
the
little
house
and
wondered
for
an
instant
whether
it
was
all
true
where
were
all
those
half
cloudy
dreams
those
impulses
those
dread
inheritances
that
once
he
had
known
so
well
where
that
other
peter
westcott
not
here
in
this
dear
delicious
little
house
with
love
and
home
and
great
raging
happiness
in
his
heart
he
wrote
to
stephen
to
zanti
to
norah
monogue
and
told
them
he
received
no
answers
no
word
from
the
outer
world
had
come
to
him
that
other
life
seemed
cut
off
separated
closed
perhaps
it
had
left
him
for
ever
perhaps
as
clare
said
walls
and
fires
were
better
than
wind
and
loneliness
comfort
more
than
danger
meanwhile
in
his
study
at
the
top
of
the
house
the
stone
house
was
still
lying
waiting
at
chapter
ii
but
it
was
clare
who
was
the
eternal
wonder
he
could
not
think
of
her
create
her
pile
up
the
offerings
before
her
altar
sufficiently
that
he
should
have
had
the
good
fortune
it
never
ceased
to
amaze
him
as
the
weeks
and
months
passed
his
life
centred
more
and
more
round
clare
and
the
house
that
they
shared
together
he
knew
now
many
people
in
london
they
were
invited
continually
to
dinners
parties
theatres
dances
clare
set
in
london
had
been
very
different
from
literary
world
and
they
were
therefore
acclaimed
citizens
of
two
very
different
circles
peter
too
had
his
reviewing
articles
in
many
papers
the
whole
whirligig
of
fleet
street
how
little
a
time
by
the
way
since
that
dreadful
day
when
he
had
sat
on
that
seat
on
the
embankment
and
talked
to
the
lady
with
the
hat
his
days
during
this
first
year
of
married
life
were
full
varied
exciting
as
they
could
be
and
yet
through
it
all
his
eye
was
always
upon
that
little
house
upon
the
moment
when
the
door
might
be
closed
the
fire
blazing
and
they
two
were
alone
alone
he
was
indeed
during
this
year
a
charming
peter
he
loved
her
with
the
hero
worship
of
a
boy
but
also
with
a
humour
a
consciousness
of
success
a
happy
freedom
that
denied
all
mawkish
sham
sentiment
he
studied
only
to
please
her
he
found
that
after
all
she
did
not
care
very
greatly
for
literature
or
music
or
pictures
her
enthusiasm
for
these
things
was
the
enthusiasm
of
a
child
who
is
bathed
in
an
atmosphere
of
appreciation
and
would
return
it
on
to
any
object
that
she
could
find
he
discovered
that
she
loved
compliments
that
she
cared
about
dress
that
she
loved
to
have
crowds
of
friends
about
her
and
that
parties
excited
her
as
though
these
were
the
first
that
she
had
ever
known
but
he
found
too
that
in
those
when
she
was
alone
with
him
she
showed
her
love
for
him
with
a
passion
and
emphasis
that
was
almost
terrifying
sometimes
when
she
clung
to
him
it
was
as
though
she
was
afraid
that
it
was
not
going
to
last
he
discovered
in
the
very
beginning
that
below
all
her
happy
easy
life
an
undercurrent
of
apprehension
sometimes
only
vaguely
felt
sometimes
springing
into
sight
like
the
eyes
of
some
beast
in
the
dark
kept
company
with
her
it
was
always
the
future
a
perfectly
vague
indefinite
future
that
terrified
her
every
moment
of
her
life
had
been
sheltered
and
happy
and
by
reason
of
that
very
shelter
her
fears
had
grown
upon
her
he
remembered
one
evening
when
they
had
been
present
at
some
party
and
she
had
been
radiant
beautiful
in
his
eyes
divine
her
little
body
had
been
strung
to
its
utmost
energy
she
had
whirled
through
the
evening
and
at
last
as
they
returned
in
the
cab
she
had
laid
her
head
on
his
shoulder
and
suddenly
flung
her
arms
about
him
and
kissed
him
his
eyes
his
cheeks
his
mouth
again
and
again
oh
i
so
safe
with
you
peter
dear
she
had
cried
to
him
he
loved
those
evenings
when
they
were
alone
and
she
would
sit
on
the
floor
with
her
head
on
his
knee
and
her
hand
against
his
then
suddenly
she
would
lean
back
and
pull
his
head
down
and
kiss
his
eyes
and
then
very
slowly
let
him
go
and
the
fierceness
the
passion
of
her
love
for
him
roused
in
him
a
strength
of
devotion
that
all
the
years
of
unhappiness
had
been
storing
he
was
still
only
a
boy
the
first
married
year
brought
his
birthday
but
his
love
for
clare
had
the
depth
and
reserve
that
belongs
to
a
man
launce
watching
them
both
was
sometimes
frightened
god
help
them
both
if
anything
interferes
she
said
once
to
her
husband
seen
that
boy
look
at
clare
with
a
devotion
that
hurts
peter
no
ordinary
mortal
i
wonder
now
and
again
whether
clare
worth
it
but
this
year
seemed
to
silence
all
her
fears
the
happiness
of
that
little
house
shone
through
chelsea
oh
we
dining
with
the
westcotts
they
cheer
us
up
they
always
so
happy
oh
did
you
see
clare
westcott
i
never
saw
any
one
so
and
once
bobby
said
to
alice
we
made
a
mistake
old
girl
about
that
marriage
it
made
another
man
of
peter
he
joy
if
only
alice
had
answered
destiny
or
whatever
it
is
will
let
them
alone
i
feel
as
though
they
were
two
precious
pieces
of
china
that
a
housemaid
might
sweep
off
the
chimney
piece
at
any
moment
if
only
nobody
will
touch
them
meanwhile
peter
had
forgotten
utterly
forgotten
the
rest
of
the
world
walls
and
fires
for
a
year
they
had
held
him
the
roundabout
versus
the
world
what
of
old
frosted
moses
of
the
sea
road
of
stephen
of
zanti
what
of
those
desperate
days
in
bucket
lane
all
gone
for
nothing
clare
perhaps
with
this
year
behind
her
hardly
realised
the
forces
against
which
she
was
arrayed
beware
of
the
gods
after
silence
iv
and
after
all
it
was
clare
herself
who
flung
down
the
glove
on
a
winter
evening
she
was
engaged
to
some
woman
party
peter
had
planned
an
evening
snug
and
industrious
alone
with
a
book
the
stone
house
awaited
his
attention
he
had
not
worked
at
it
for
months
also
he
knew
that
he
owed
henry
galleon
a
visit
why
he
had
not
been
to
see
the
old
man
lately
he
scarcely
knew
clare
standing
in
the
little
hall
waiting
for
a
cab
suggested
an
alternative
peter
dear
why
do
you
go
round
to
brockett
if
you
nothing
to
do
brockett
yes
you
never
been
since
we
married
and
i
had
a
letter
from
norah
this
morning
not
at
all
cheerful
i
afraid
she
been
ill
for
months
they
love
to
see
brockett
he
stood
astounded
well
why
not
a
strange
emotion
uncomfortable
alien
stirred
him
he
kissed
her
and
saw
her
go
with
a
gaze
what
a
world
away
brockett
seemed
old
lazarus
norah
poor
norah
brockett
young
robin
tressiter
they
would
be
glad
to
see
him
it
was
a
natural
thing
enough
that
he
should
go
what
was
it
that
held
him
back
for
the
first
time
since
his
marriage
as
he
slowly
and
thoughtfully
put
on
his
greatcoat
he
was
distressed
he
reproached
himself
norah
stephen
mr
zanti
he
had
not
given
them
a
thought
he
felt
as
he
went
out
as
though
he
were
going
with
key
and
candle
to
unlock
some
old
rusty
door
that
led
into
secret
rooms
it
was
a
wet
windy
night
the
branches
of
the
little
orchard
rattled
and
groaned
and
doors
and
windows
were
creaking
as
he
passed
into
the
shadows
and
silence
of
bloomsbury
the
impression
weighed
with
increasing
heaviness
upon
him
that
the
old
peter
had
come
back
and
that
his
married
life
with
clare
had
been
a
dream
he
was
still
at
brockett
still
silent
shy
awkward
still
poring
over
pages
of
reuben
hallard
and
wondering
whether
any
one
would
ever
publish
it
still
spending
so
many
hours
in
the
old
musty
bookshop
with
herr
gottfried
wild
mop
of
hair
coming
so
madly
above
the
little
counter
the
wind
tugged
at
his
umbrella
the
rain
lashed
his
face
and
at
last
breathless
with
the
sharp
corner
of
his
upturned
collar
digging
into
his
chin
he
pulled
the
bell
of
the
old
grey
remorseless
door
that
he
knew
so
well
there
was
no
one
in
bennett
square
only
the
two
lamps
dimly
marked
its
desolation
the
door
was
opened
by
brockett
herself
and
she
stood
there
stern
and
black
peering
into
his
face
what
is
it
what
do
you
want
she
asked
grimly
he
brushed
past
her
laughing
and
stood
back
under
the
gas
in
the
hall
looking
at
her
she
gave
a
little
cry
no
it
ca
be
why
westcott
he
had
never
in
all
the
seven
years
that
he
had
been
with
her
seen
her
so
strongly
moved
but
westcott
to
think
of
it
and
the
times
we
talked
of
you
and
you
never
coming
near
us
all
this
while
you
might
have
been
dead
for
all
we
knew
and
indeed
if
it
had
been
for
miss
monogue
the
other
day
we
have
heard
no
news
since
the
day
that
wild
man
with
the
beard
came
walking
in
she
broke
off
suddenly
and
there
you
are
holding
your
umbrella
with
the
point
down
and
making
a
great
pool
on
the
carpet
as
though
she
took
the
umbrella
from
him
but
her
hand
rested
for
an
instant
on
his
arm
and
she
said
gruffly
but
all
the
same
peter
i
more
glad
to
see
you
than
i
can
say
she
took
him
into
her
little
room
and
looked
at
him
but
you
not
changed
in
the
least
she
said
not
in
the
very
least
and
where
pray
peter
have
you
been
all
this
time
and
come
nowhere
near
us
he
tried
to
explain
he
was
confused
he
said
something
about
marriage
and
stopped
the
room
was
filled
with
that
subtle
odour
that
brought
his
other
life
back
to
him
in
a
torrent
he
was
bathed
in
it
overwhelmed
by
it
mutton
blacking
decayed
flowers
geraniums
damp
stone
bread
being
toasted
all
these
things
were
in
it
he
filled
his
nostrils
with
the
delicious
pathos
and
intimacy
of
it
she
regarded
him
sternly
now
peter
it
of
no
use
oh
yes
we
heard
about
your
wedding
you
wrote
to
miss
monogue
but
there
were
days
before
that
many
of
them
and
never
so
much
as
a
postcard
with
some
of
my
boarders
it
would
be
natural
enough
because
what
could
you
expect
did
want
did
want
only
habit
as
you
might
say
but
you
peter
why
just
think
of
the
way
we
were
fond
of
you
lazarus
and
little
robin
and
miss
monogue
as
well
as
she
stopped
and
pulled
out
her
handkerchief
and
blew
her
nose
i
dare
say
you
a
famous
man
she
went
on
with
your
books
and
your
marriage
and
the
rest
of
it
but
that
does
alter
your
old
friends
being
your
old
friends
and
it
never
will
there
i
getting
cross
when
all
i
mean
to
say
is
that
i
more
delighted
to
see
you
than
he
was
humble
before
her
he
felt
indeed
that
he
had
been
the
most
unutterable
brute
how
could
he
have
stayed
away
all
this
time
with
these
dear
people
waiting
for
him
he
simply
had
realised
and
miss
monogue
he
asked
at
last
i
afraid
she
not
been
very
well
she
been
very
ill
indeed
for
months
at
one
time
we
were
afraid
that
she
would
go
it
her
heart
poor
dear
and
she
been
worrying
so
about
her
work
but
she
better
now
and
she
be
truly
glad
to
see
you
peter
but
you
must
stay
more
than
a
few
minutes
she
up
on
the
sofa
but
it
the
excitement
that
bad
for
but
first
peter
went
to
pay
a
visit
to
the
tressiter
establishment
he
knew
from
old
custom
that
this
would
be
the
hour
when
the
family
would
be
getting
itself
by
slow
and
noisy
degrees
to
bed
so
tremendous
indeed
was
the
tumult
that
he
was
able
to
open
the
door
and
stand
within
the
room
watching
and
tressiter
was
attempting
to
bathe
a
fat
and
very
strident
baby
two
small
boys
were
standing
on
a
bed
and
hitting
one
another
with
pillows
a
little
girl
lay
on
her
face
on
the
floor
and
howled
for
no
apparent
reason
robin
but
little
older
than
peter
last
impression
of
him
had
painted
was
standing
naked
save
for
his
shirt
and
looking
down
gravely
at
his
screaming
sister
every
now
and
again
tressiter
without
ceasing
from
her
work
on
the
baby
who
slipped
about
in
her
hands
like
a
stout
eel
cried
in
a
shrill
voice
children
if
you
do
be
quiet
or
nicholas
in
a
moment
i
give
you
such
a
beating
or
agatha
for
sake
then
suddenly
robin
looking
up
caught
sight
of
peter
he
gave
a
shout
and
was
across
the
room
in
an
instant
there
was
never
a
moment
doubt
in
his
eyes
he
flung
himself
upon
peter
body
he
wound
his
arms
round
peter
leg
he
beat
upon
his
chest
with
his
bullet
head
he
cried
oh
peter
has
come
peter
has
come
tressiter
let
the
baby
fall
into
the
bath
with
a
splash
and
there
it
lay
howling
the
other
members
of
the
family
gathered
round
but
peter
thought
that
he
had
known
no
joy
so
acute
for
years
as
the
welcome
that
the
small
boy
gave
him
he
hoisted
robin
on
to
his
shoulder
and
there
robin
sat
with
his
naked
little
legs
dangling
over
his
hands
in
the
big
man
neck
oh
westcott
i
sure
said
tressiter
smiling
from
ear
to
ear
and
wiping
her
wet
hands
on
her
apron
robin
bent
his
head
and
bit
peter
ear
get
on
horse
he
cried
and
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
there
was
wild
riot
in
the
tressiter
family
then
they
were
all
put
to
bed
as
good
as
gold
you
might
have
heard
a
pin
drop
said
tressiter
when
agatha
said
her
prayers
and
at
last
the
lights
were
put
out
peter
bent
down
over
robin
bed
and
the
boy
flung
his
arms
round
his
neck
i
dreamed
of
you
i
knew
you
come
he
whispered
what
shall
i
send
you
as
a
present
asked
peter
soldiers
soldiers
on
horses
those
with
cannons
and
shiny
things
on
their
backs
robin
was
very
explicit
you
be
here
he
asked
no
not
peter
answered
soon
yes
i
love
you
more
than
agatha
more
than
dick
more
than
any
one
daddy
and
you
be
a
good
boy
until
i
come
back
promise
but
come
back
peter
gave
him
a
long
kiss
and
left
him
supposing
one
day
he
had
a
boy
like
that
a
little
boy
in
a
shirt
like
that
would
it
be
simply
too
wonderful
a
boy
to
give
soldiers
to
he
went
across
to
miss
monogue
door
a
faint
voice
answered
his
knock
and
entering
the
room
the
scent
of
medicine
and
flowers
that
he
always
connected
with
his
mother
met
him
norah
monogue
very
white
with
dark
shadows
beneath
her
eyes
was
lying
on
the
sofa
by
the
fire
brockett
had
prepared
her
for
peter
coming
and
she
smiled
up
at
him
with
her
old
smile
and
gave
him
her
hand
how
thin
and
white
it
was
with
its
long
slender
fingers
he
sat
down
by
her
sofa
and
he
knew
by
the
way
that
she
looked
at
him
that
she
was
reproaching
him
naughty
peter
she
said
all
these
months
and
you
have
been
nowhere
near
i
too
have
a
bone
you
never
sent
me
a
word
about
my
she
turned
her
head
away
i
was
frightfully
ill
just
then
they
think
i
pull
through
i
did
write
afterwards
to
clare
i
told
her
how
ill
i
been
she
never
told
peter
bent
over
the
sofa
but
i
am
ashamed
norah
more
ashamed
than
i
can
say
after
i
got
well
and
went
to
live
with
the
galleons
a
new
life
seemed
to
begin
for
me
and
i
was
so
eager
and
excited
about
it
all
and
then
he
hesitated
for
a
moment
there
was
yes
i
know
there
was
clare
and
i
am
so
delighted
about
it
i
know
that
you
will
both
be
so
happy
but
when
one
is
lying
here
week
after
week
and
is
worried
and
tired
things
take
such
a
different
outline
i
thought
that
you
and
clare
that
you
had
given
me
up
altogether
and
suddenly
hiding
her
face
in
her
hands
she
began
to
cry
it
was
inexpressibly
desolate
there
in
the
dim
bare
little
room
and
the
sharp
sense
of
his
neglect
and
the
remembrance
of
the
good
friend
that
she
had
been
to
him
for
so
many
years
overwhelmed
peter
he
knelt
down
and
put
his
arms
round
her
norah
do
please
i
bear
it
it
all
right
i
been
a
beast
a
selfish
cad
but
it
happen
again
i
come
often
i
she
cried
for
a
little
and
then
she
smiled
at
him
i
a
fool
to
cry
like
that
but
you
see
i
weak
and
ill
and
seeing
you
again
after
all
this
time
and
your
being
so
successful
and
happy
upset
me
i
suppose
forgive
it
peter
and
come
again
one
day
when
i
better
and
stronger
and
bring
clare
she
held
tightly
to
his
hand
and
her
grasp
was
hot
and
feverish
he
reassured
her
told
her
that
he
would
come
soon
again
that
he
would
bring
clare
and
so
left
her
he
took
a
cab
and
drove
back
to
chelsea
in
a
storm
of
agitation
suddenly
out
of
nothing
as
it
were
all
these
people
this
old
life
had
been
thrust
up
in
front
of
him
had
demanded
made
claims
about
him
once
again
was
the
old
atmosphere
figures
were
filling
his
brain
the
world
was
a
wild
tossing
place
one
of
those
roundabouts
with
the
hissing
lights
the
screaming
music
the
horses
going
up
and
down
plain
enough
now
that
the
old
life
was
not
done
with
every
moment
of
his
past
life
seemed
to
spring
before
him
claiming
recognition
he
was
drunk
with
the
desire
for
work
he
flung
the
cabman
something
dashed
into
the
little
house
was
in
his
room
the
lamp
was
lighted
the
door
was
shut
there
was
silence
and
in
his
brain
figures
scenes
sentences
were
racing
the
stone
house
neglected
for
so
long
had
begun
once
more
to
climb
the
hours
passed
the
white
sheets
were
covered
and
flung
aside
dimly
through
a
haze
he
saw
clare
standing
in
the
doorway
bad
old
boy
he
scarcely
glanced
up
i
not
coming
yet
caught
by
do
be
at
it
too
he
made
no
reply
she
closed
the
door
softly
behind
her
chapter
v
the
i
then
out
of
the
wind
and
rain
came
zanti
ii
three
days
after
peter
visit
to
brockett
he
was
finishing
a
letter
before
dressing
for
dinner
he
and
clare
were
going
on
to
a
party
later
in
the
evening
but
were
dining
quietly
alone
together
first
the
storms
that
had
fallen
upon
london
three
days
before
were
still
pommelling
and
buffeting
the
city
the
trees
outside
the
window
groaned
and
creaked
with
a
mysterious
importance
as
though
they
were
trying
to
tell
one
another
secrets
and
little
branches
tapped
at
the
dripping
panes
he
was
writing
in
the
little
warm
and
comfortable
and
the
maria
theresa
so
small
a
person
in
so
much
glory
looked
down
on
him
from
her
silver
frame
and
gave
him
company
then
sarah
a
minute
servant
who
always
entered
a
room
as
though
swept
into
it
by
a
cyclone
breathlessly
announced
that
there
was
a
gentleman
to
see
westcott
drippin
in
the
she
gasped
and
handed
peter
a
very
dirty
bit
of
paper
peter
read
dear
boy
being
about
to
leave
this
country
on
an
expedition
of
the
utmost
importance
i
feel
that
i
must
shake
you
by
the
hand
before
i
go
emilio
zanti
enormous
smiling
from
ear
to
ear
engulfed
in
a
great
coat
from
which
his
huge
head
buffeted
by
wind
and
rain
his
red
cheeks
his
rosy
nose
his
sparkling
eyes
stood
out
like
some
strange
and
cheerful
flower
filled
the
doorway
he
enfolded
peter
in
his
arms
pressed
him
against
very
wet
garments
kissed
him
on
both
cheeks
and
burst
into
a
torrent
of
explanation
he
was
only
in
london
for
a
very
few
days
he
must
see
his
dearest
peter
so
often
before
he
had
wanted
to
see
his
peter
but
he
had
thought
that
it
would
be
better
to
leave
him
and
then
he
had
heard
that
his
peter
was
married
well
he
must
see
his
lady
it
was
entirely
necessary
that
he
should
kiss
her
hand
and
wish
her
well
and
congratulate
her
on
having
secured
his
own
own
peter
for
a
life
partner
yes
he
had
found
his
address
from
that
pension
where
peter
used
to
live
they
had
told
him
and
he
had
come
at
once
because
at
once
this
very
night
he
was
away
to
spain
where
there
was
a
secret
expedition
ah
very
secret
and
soon
in
a
month
two
months
he
would
return
a
rich
rich
man
this
was
the
adventure
of
zanti
life
and
when
he
was
in
england
again
he
zanti
would
see
much
of
peter
and
of
his
beautiful
wife
of
course
she
was
beautiful
and
of
the
dear
children
that
were
to
come
here
peter
interrupted
him
he
had
listened
to
the
torrent
of
words
in
an
odd
confusion
the
last
time
that
he
had
seen
zanti
he
had
left
him
sitting
with
his
head
in
his
hands
sobbing
in
the
little
bookshop
since
then
everything
had
happened
he
peter
had
had
success
love
position
comfort
the
gods
had
poured
everything
into
his
hands
and
now
to
his
amazement
as
he
sat
there
in
the
little
room
opposite
his
huge
fantastic
friend
he
was
almost
regretting
all
those
glorious
things
that
had
come
to
him
and
was
wishing
himself
back
in
the
dark
little
bookshop
dark
but
lighted
with
the
fire
of
zanti
amazing
adventures
but
there
was
more
than
this
in
his
thoughts
as
he
looked
at
zanti
at
his
wild
black
locks
his
flaming
cheeks
his
rolling
eyes
his
large
red
hands
he
was
aware
suddenly
that
clare
would
not
appreciate
him
it
was
the
first
time
since
his
marriage
that
there
had
been
any
question
of
clare
criticism
but
now
he
knew
with
absolute
certainty
that
zanti
was
entirely
outside
clare
range
of
possible
persons
for
the
first
time
almost
with
a
secret
start
of
apprehension
he
knew
that
there
were
things
that
she
did
not
understand
i
afraid
he
said
that
my
wife
is
dressing
but
when
you
come
back
you
shall
meet
of
course
that
will
be
and
then
he
went
on
but
i
simply
ca
tell
you
how
splendid
it
is
to
look
at
you
again
lots
of
things
have
happened
to
me
since
i
saw
you
of
course
but
i
just
the
same
whilst
he
was
speaking
his
voice
had
become
eager
his
eyes
bright
he
began
to
pace
the
room
excitedly
oh
zanti
the
days
we
used
to
have
i
suppose
the
times
i
been
having
lately
had
put
it
all
out
of
my
head
but
now
with
you
here
it
all
as
though
it
happened
yesterday
the
day
we
left
cornwall
you
and
i
the
fog
when
we
got
to
london
he
drew
a
great
breath
and
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
listening
to
the
rain
racing
down
the
pipes
beyond
the
dark
windows
zanti
getting
up
ponderously
placed
his
hands
on
shoulders
still
the
same
peter
he
said
now
i
know
zat
i
go
zat
is
all
i
came
for
i
said
i
must
zee
my
peter
because
stephen
stephen
broke
in
peter
sharply
yes

stephen
he
goes
with
me
now
to
spain
he
is
now
until

london
but
he
will
not
come

afraid

yes
says

and

says

ver
long
time
and
just
asked
me
to
give
you
love
and
say
that
when

back
from
spain
stephen
peter
voice
was
sharp
with
distress
zanti
where
is
he
now
i
must
go
and
see
him
at
no
gone
already
to
the
boat

zanti
added
in
a
softer
voice
so
when
he

me
that

i
say

his
old
friends

all
this
time
but

write
a
note
that
you
shall
take
to
him
and
then
when
he
comes
back
from
spain
he
went
to
his
table
and
began
to
write
eagerly
zanti
meanwhile
went
round
the
room
on
examining
everything
sometimes
shaking
his
huge
head
in
disapproval
sometimes
nodding
his
appreciation
peter
wrote
dear
stephen
i
am
furious
i
hate
myself
what
can
i
have
been
doing
all
this
time
i
have
thought
of
you
often
but
my
marriage
and
all
the
new
life
have
made
me
selfish
and
always
i
put
off
writing
to
you
because
i
thought
the
quiet
hour
would
come
to
me
and
it
has
never
come
but
i
have
no
excuse
except
that
in
the
real
part
of
myself
i
love
you
just
the
same
as
ever
and
it
will
be
always
the
same
i
have
been
bewildered
i
think
by
all
the
things
that
have
happened
to
me
during
this
last
year
but
i
will
never
be
bewildered
again
write
to
me
from
spain
and
then
as
soon
as
you
come
back
i
will
make
amends
for
my
wickedness
i
am
now
and
always
your
loving
zanti
took
the
letter
how
is
he
asked
peter
i
found
down
in
treliss
he
was
was
thinking
of
that
woman
and
then
was
all
alone
got
some
work
at
a
farm
out
at
pendragon
and
was
just
goin
there
when
i
came
along
and
made
come
to
spain
was
thinkin
of
you
a
lot
zanti
cast
one
more
look
round
the
room
pretty
he
said
pretty
but
not
my
sort
of
place
too
many
walls
all
too
close
in
the
hall
he
said
once
more
a
little
plaintively
i
like
to
see
your
lady
peter
and
then
he
went
on
hurriedly
but
do
you
go
and
disturb
her
not
for
anything
understand
and
with
his
finger
on
his
lip
wrapt
in
the
deepest
mystery
he
departed
into
the
rain
as
the
door
closed
behind
him
peter
felt
a
wave
of
chill
unhappy
loneliness
he
turned
back
into
the
cheerful
little
hall
and
heard
clare
singing
upstairs
he
knew
that
they
were
going
to
have
a
delightful
little
dinner
that
afterwards
they
would
be
at
a
party
where
every
one
would
be
pleased
to
see
them
he
knew
that
the
evening
in
front
of
him
should
be
wholly
charming
and
yet
he
was
uneasy
he
felt
now
as
though
he
ought
to
resign
his
evening
climb
to
his
little
room
and
work
at
the
stone
and
yet
what
connection
could
that
possibly
have
with
zanti
his
uneasiness
had
begun
he
thought
after
his
visit
to
brockett
it
seemed
to
him
as
he
went
upstairs
to
dress
that
the
world
was
too
full
of
too
many
things
and
that
his
outlook
on
it
all
was
confused
throughout
dinner
this
uneasiness
remained
with
him
had
he
been
less
occupied
with
his
own
thoughts
he
would
have
noticed
that
clare
was
not
herself
at
first
she
talked
excitedly
without
waiting
for
his
answers
there
were
her
usual
enthusiasms
and
excitements
everything
in
the
day
history
had
been
enchanting
or
horrible
as
a
rule
she
waited
for
him
to
act
up
to
her
ecstasies
and
abhorrencies
she
talked
as
though
she
had
no
audience
but
were
determined
to
fill
up
time
then
suddenly
she
was
silent
her
eyes
looked
tired
and
into
them
there
crept
a
strange
secret
little
shudder
as
though
she
were
afraid
of
some
thought
or
mysterious
knowledge
she
looked
now
like
a
little
girl
who
knew
that
the
inevitable
she
must
go
to
the
dentist
to
be
tortured
the
last
part
of
the
meal
was
passed
in
silence
afterwards
she
came
into
his
study
and
sat
curled
upon
the
floor
at
his
feet
watching
him
smoke
she
thought
as
she
looked
up
at
him
that
something
had
happened
to
make
him
younger
she
had
never
seen
him
as
young
as
he
was
and
then
because
his
thoughts
were
far
away
and
because
her
own
troubled
her
she
made
a
diversion
she
said
who
that
extraordinary
man
you
were
talking
to
this
evening
he
came
back
with
a
jerk
from
stephen
what
man
why
the
man
with
all
the
black
hair
and
a
funny
squash
hat
i
saw
sarah
let
him
ah
that
said
peter
looking
down
at
her
tenderly
that
was
a
great
friend
of
she
moved
her
head
away
do
touch
my
hair
peter
it
all
been
arranged
for
the
party
a
friend
of
yours
what
that
horrible
looking
man
oh
i
suppose
he
was
one
of
those
dreadful
people
you
knew
in
the
slums
or
in
peter
saw
zanti
dear
friendly
face
like
a
moon
staring
at
him
and
heard
his
warm
husky
voice
peter
my
boy
he
moved
a
little
impatiently
look
here
old
girl
you
must
call
him
that
he
one
of
the
very
best
friends
i
ever
had
and
i
been
rather
pulled
up
lately
ever
since
that
night
you
sent
me
to
brockett
i
felt
ashamed
of
myself
all
my
happiness
and
you
and
everything
have
made
me
forget
my
old
friends
and
that
wo
she
laughed
and
now
i
suppose
you
going
to
neglect
me
for
them
for
horrid
people
like
that
man
who
came
her
voice
was
shaking
a
little
he
saw
that
her
hands
were
clenched
on
her
lap
he
looked
down
at
her
in
astonishment
my
dear
clare
what
do
you
mean
how
could
you
say
a
thing
like
that
even
in
jest
you
know
she
broke
in
upon
him
almost
fiercely
it
was
jest
i
meant
what
i
said
i
hate
all
these
earlier
people
you
used
to
know
and
now
after
our
being
so
happy
all
this
time
you
going
to
take
them
up
again
and
make
the
place
impossible
look
here
clare
you
must
speak
of
them
like
that
they
my
friends
and
they
got
to
be
treated
as
his
voice
was
suddenly
stern
and
by
the
way
as
we
are
talking
about
it
i
do
think
it
was
very
kind
of
you
to
tell
me
nothing
at
all
about
poor
norah
being
so
she
asked
you
to
tell
me
and
you
never
said
a
word
that
very
kind
of
i
did
speak
to
you
about
it
but
you
forgot
i
do
think
you
did
i
am
quite
sure
that
i
should
not
have
forgotten
oh
of
course
you
contradict
me
anyhow
there
no
reason
to
drag
norah
monogue
into
this
the
matter
is
perfectly
clear
i
will
not
have
dirty
old
men
like
that
coming
into
the
clare
you
shall
not
speak
of
my
friends
oh
sha
i
when
i
married
you
i
did
marry
all
your
old
horrid
friends
drop
it
clare
or
i
shall
be
angry
she
sprang
to
her
feet
faced
him
he
had
never
in
his
life
seen
such
fury
she
stood
with
her
little
body
drawn
to
its
full
height
her
hands
clenched

she
burst
from
the
room
banging
the
door
behind
her
she
had
behaved
exactly
like
a
small
child
in
the
nursery
as
he
looked
at
the
door
he
was
bewildered
whence
suddenly
had
this
figure
sprung
it
was
some
one
whom
he
did
not
know
he
could
not
reconcile
it
with
the
dignified
clare
proud
as
a
queen
crossing
a
or
the
dear
beloved
clare
nestling
into
a
corner
of
his
her
face
against
his
or
the
gentle
friendly
clare
listening
to
some
story
of
distress
the
fury
the
tempest
of
it
it
was
as
though
everything
in
the
room
had
been
broken
and
he
with
his
glorious
tragical
youth
felt
that
the
end
of
the
world
had
come
this
was
the
conclusion
of
life
no
more
cause
for
living
no
more
friendship
or
comfort
or
help
anywhere
clare
had
said
those
things
to
him
he
stood
for
ten
minutes
there
in
the
middle
of
the
room
without
moving
his
face
white
his
eyes
full
of
pain
sarah
came
to
tell
him
that
the
hansom
was
there
he
moved
into
the
hall
with
the
intention
of
sending
it
away
no
party
for
him
when
to
his
amazement
he
saw
clare
coming
slowly
down
the
stairs
her
cloak
on
buttoning
her
gloves
she
passed
him
without
a
word
and
got
into
the
hansom
he
took
his
hat
and
coat
gave
the
driver
the
address
and
climbed
in
beside
her
once
as
they
drove
he
put
out
his
hand
touched
her
dress
and
said
clare
dear
she
made
no
reply
but
sat
looking
with
her
eyes
large
and
black
in
her
little
white
face
steadfastly
in

iii
lady
luncon
was
a
rich
woman
who
had
recently
published
a
novel
and
was
anxious
to
hear
it
praised
therefore
she
gave
a
party
originally
a
manufacturer
daughter
she
had
conquered
a
penniless
baronet
spent
twenty
years
in
the
besieging
of
certain
and
now
tired
of
more
mundane
worlds
fixed
her
attention
upon
the
arts
she
was
a
completely
stupid
woman
her
novel
had
been
exceedingly
vulgar
but
her
good
heart
and
a
habit
of
speaking
vaguely
in
capital
letters
secured
her
attention
when
clare
and
peter
arrived
people
were
filling
her
overflowing
on
to
the
stairs
and
pouring
into
the
supper
room
some
one
very
far
away
was
singing
mon
coeur
a
ta
voix
a
babel
of
voices
rose
about
clare
and
peter
on
every
side
every
one
was
flung
against
every
one
heat
and
scent
the
crackle
and
rustle
of
clothes
the
soft
voices
of
the
men
and
sharp
strident
voices
of
the
women
gave
one
the
sensation
of
imminent
suffocation
people
with
hot
red
faces
unable
to
move
at
all
flung
agonised
glances
at
the
door
as
though
the
entrance
of
one
more
person
must
mean
death
and
disaster
there
were
peter
soon
discovered
three
topics
of
conversation
one
was
their
hostess
novel
and
this
was
only
discussed
when
lady
luncon
was
herself
somewhere
at
hand
the
second
topic
concerned
the
books
of
somebody
who
had
most
unjustly
it
appeared
been
banned
by
the
libraries
for
impropriety
and
here
opinions
were
divided
as
to
whether
the
author
would
gain
by
the
advertisement
or
lose
by
loss
of
library
circulation
thirdly
there
was
a
new
young
man
who
had
written
a
novel
about
the
love
affairs
of
a
crocus
and
a
violet
it
was
amazingly
improper
full
of
poetry
right
back
as
somebody
said
to
moreover
there
was
much
talk
about
form
here
is
the
new
thing
in
fiction
that
we
are
looking
for
also
quite
a
young
man
oh
yes
only
about
eighteen
and
so
modest
you
would
never
think
his
name
was
rondel
and
peter
saw
him
for
a
moment
as
the
crowds
parted
standing
with
a
tall
grim
elderly
woman
apparently
his
mother
beside
him
he
was
looking
frightened
and
embarrassed
and
stood
up
straight
against
the
wall
as
though
afraid
lest
some
one
should
come
and
snatch
him
away
but
peter
saw
the
world
in
a
dream
he
walked
about
with
clare
beside
him
and
talked
to
many
people
then
she
was
stopped
by
some
one
whom
she
knew
and
he
went
on
alone
now
there
had
come
back
to
him
the
old
terror
if
he
went
back
after
this
was
over
and
clare
was
still
angry
with
him
he
did
not
know
what
he
would
do
he
was
afraid
he
smiled
talked
laughed
and
in
his
chest
there
was
a
sharp
acute
pain
like
a
knife
he
had
still
with
him
that
feeling
that
nothing
in
life
now
was
worth
while
and
there
followed
on
that
a
wild
impulse
to
let
go
to
fling
off
the
restraints
that
he
had
retained
now
for
so
long
and
with
such
bitter
determination
he
wanted
to
cast
aside
this
absurd
party
to
hurry
home
alone
with
clare
to
sit
alone
with
her
in
the
little
house
and
to
reach
the
divine
moment
when
reconciliation
came
and
they
were
closer
to
one
another
than
ever
before
and
then
there
was
the
horrible
suggestion
that
there
would
be
no
reconciliation
that
clare
would
make
of
this
absurd
quarrel
an
eternal
breach
that
things
would
never
be
right
again
he
looked
back
and
saw
clare
smiling
gaily
happily
at
some
friend
he
saw
her
as
she
had
faced
him
furiously
an
hour
earlier
oh
god
if
she
should
never
care
for
him
again
he
recognised
many
friends
there
were
the
two
young
galleons
millicent
and
percival
looking
as
important
and
mysterious
as
possible
taxing
their
brains
for
something
clever
to
say
ah
that
life
peter
heard
percival
say
to
some
one
young
fools
he
thought
to
himself
let
them
have
my
trouble
and
then
they
may
talk
but
they
were
nice
to
him
when
he
came
up
to
them
the
author
of
reuben
hallard
even
though
he
did
look
like
a
sailor
on
leave
was
worth
respecting
moreover
father
liked
him
and
believed
in
him
nevertheless
he
was
just
a
tiny
bit
last
year
have
you
read
said
percival
eagerly
violet
redemption
it
really
is
the
most
tremendous
thing
all
about
a
violet
there
the
fellow
who
wrote
it
over
there
young
chap
standing
with
his
back
to
the
wall
there
was
also
with
them
young
tony
gale
who
was
a
friend
of
alice
galleon
he
was
eager
and
enthusiastic
rather
too
enthusiastic
peter
who
did
not
like
him
considered
full
of
the
joy
of
life
everything
was
topping
and
i
ca
understand
he
would
say
why
people
find
life
dull
i
never
find
it
dull
it
the
most
wonderful
glorious
thing
ah
but
then
you
so
young
he
always
expected
his
companions
to
say
and
the
thing
that
pleased
him
most
of
all
was
to
hear
some
one
declare
tony
gale
such
a
puzzle
sometimes
he
seems
only
eighteen
and
then
suddenly
he
it
was
rumoured
that
he
had
once
been
in
love
with
alice
galleon
when
she
had
been
alice
du
cane
and
that
they
had
nearly
made
a
match
of
it
but
he
was
certainly
now
married
to
a
charming
girl
whom
he
had
seen
in
cornwall
and
the
two
young
things
were
considered
delightful
by
the
whole
of
chelsea
tony
gale
had
with
him
a
man
called
james
maradick
whom
peter
had
met
before
and
liked
maradick
was
or
three
large
rather
heavy
in
build
and
expression
and
very
taciturn
he
was
in
business
in
the
city
but
had
been
drawn
peter
knew
not
how
into
the
literary
world
of
london
he
was
often
to
be
found
at
dinner
parties
and
evening
squashes
silent
observant
and
generally
alone
many
people
thought
him
dull
but
peter
liked
him
partly
because
of
his
reserve
and
partly
because
of
his
enthusiasm
for
cornwall
cornwall
seemed
to
be
the
only
subject
that
could
stir
maradick
into
excitement
and
when
cornwall
was
under
discussion
the
whole
man
woke
into
sudden
stir
and
emotion
with
his
almost
cynical
observance
of
the
emotions
and
excitement
that
surged
about
him
he
seemed
to
peter
the
one
man
possible
in
the
whole
gathering
look
here
maradick
let
get
somewhere
out
of
this
crush
and
have
a
people
were
all
pouring
into
supper
now
and
peter
saw
his
wife
in
the
distance
on
bobby
galleon
arm
they
found
a
little
conservatory
deserted
now
and
strangely
quiet
after
the
din
of
the
other
rooms
here
they
sat
down
maradick
was
capable
of
sitting
quite
happily
for
hours
without
saying
anything
at
all
for
some
time
they
were
both
silent
at
last
peter
said
by
jove
maradick
yours
is
a
fortunate
sort
of
life
just
going
into
the
city
every
day
coming
back
to
your
wife
in
the
evening
no
stupid
troubles
that
come
from
imagining
things
that
are
there
how
do
you
know
i
do
answered
maradick
quietly
imagination
has
anything
to
do
with
one
profession
i
expect
there
as
much
imagination
amongst
the
stock
exchange
men
as
there
is
with
you
literary
people
only
it
expressed
what
do
you
do
said
peter
if
it
ever
gets
too
much
for
you
do
how
do
you
mean
well
suppose
you
feeling
all
the
time
that
one
little
thing
more
one
little
word
or
some
one
coming
in
or
a
window
breaking
anything
will
upset
the
equilibrium
of
everything
supposing
you
out
with
all
your
might
to
keep
things
sane
and
to
prevent
your
life
from
swinging
back
into
all
the
storm
and
uncertainty
that
it
was
in
once
before
and
supposing
you
feel
that
there
are
a
whole
lot
of
things
trying
to
get
you
to
swing
back
what
the
best
thing
to
do
why
hold
on
hold
on
how
do
you
mean
fortitude
courage
clinging
on
with
your
nails
setting
your
peter
was
surprised
at
the
man
earnestness
the
two
of
them
sitting
there
in
that
lonely
deserted
little
conservatory
were
instantly
aware
of
some
common
experience
maradick
put
his
hand
on
peter
knee
westcott
you
young
but
i
know
the
kind
of
thing
you
mean
believe
me
that
it
no
silly
nonsense
to
talk
of
the
devil
the
devil
is
as
real
and
personal
as
you
and
i
and
he
got
his
agents
in
every
sort
and
kind
of
place
if
he
once
gets
his
net
out
for
you
then
you
want
all
your
courage
i
know
he
went
on
sinking
his
voice
there
was
a
time
i
had
once
in
cornwall
when
i
was
brought
pretty
close
to
things
of
that
sort
it
does
leave
you
the
same
afterwards
there
a
place
down
in
cornwall
called
treliss
treliss
peter
almost
shouted
why
that
where
i
come
from
i
was
born
there
that
my
town
before
maradick
could
reply
bobby
galleon
burst
into
the
conservatory
oh
there
you
are
i
been
looking
for
you
everywhere
how
are
you
maradick
look
here
peter
you
got
to
come
down
to
supper
with
us
we
got
a
table
alice
clare
millicent
percival
tony
gale
and
his
wife
and
you
and
i
and
one
other
an
old
friend
of
yours
an
old
friend
said
peter
getting
up
from
his
chair
and
trying
to
look
as
though
he
were
not
furious
with
bobby
for
the
interruption
yes
you
never
guess
if
i
give
you
a
hundred
guesses
it
most
exciting
come
along
peter
was
led
away
as
he
moved
through
the
dazzling
noisy
rooms
he
was
conscious
that
there
in
the
quiet
dark
little
conservatory
maradick
was
sitting
motionless
seeing
treliss
iv
on
his
way
down
to
the
supper
room
he
was
filled
with
annoyance
at
the
thought
of
his
interrupted
conversation
he
might
never
have
his
opportunity
again
maradick
was
so
reserved
a
fellow
and
took
so
few
into
his
confidence
also
he
would
in
all
probability
be
ashamed
of
having
spoken
at
all
but
to
peter
at
that
moment
the
world
about
him
was
fantastic
and
unreal
it
seemed
to
him
that
at
certain
periods
in
his
life
he
was
suddenly
confronted
with
a
fellow
creature
who
perceived
life
as
he
perceived
it
there
were
certain
persons
who
could
not
leave
life
alone
they
must
always
be
seeing
it
as
a
key
to
something
wider
bigger
altogether
this
was
nothing
to
do
with
christianity
or
any
creed
whatever
because
creeds
implied
certainty
and
definition
of
knowledge
whereas
peter
and
the
others
like
him
did
not
know
for
what
they
were
searching
again
they
were
not
mystics
because
mysticism
needed
a
definite
removal
from
this
world
before
any
other
world
were
possible
no
they
were
simply
explorers
and
one
traced
a
member
of
the
order
on
the
instant
there
had
been
already
in
peter
life
frosted
moses
stephen
zanti
noah
monogue
and
now
suddenly
there
was
maradick
these
were
people
who
would
not
laugh
at
his
terror
of
scaw
house
at
his
odd
belief
that
his
father
was
always
trying
to
draw
him
back
to
treliss
as
he
entered
the
and
saw
clare
sitting
at
a
distant
table
he
knew
that
his
wife
would
never
be
an
explorer
for
her
fires
and
walls
for
her
no
questions
no
untidiness
moral
or
physical
the
explorer
travelled
ever
with
his
life
in
his
hands
clare
believed
in
the
the
great
was
filled
with
one
saw
it
in
their
eyes
in
the
flutter
of
useless
and
tired
words
that
rose
and
fell
all
the
souls
in
that
room
were
cushioned
and
were
happy
that
it
was
so
the
rider
on
the
lion
was
beyond
the
electric
lights
on
the
dark
hill
over
the
darker
river
under
the
stars
somebody
pulled
a
cracker
and
put
on
a
paper
cap
he
was
a
stout
man
with
a
bald
head
and
the
back
of
his
neck
rippled
with
fat
he
had
tiny
eyes
look
at
horset
cried
the
woman
next
to
him
is
he
absurd
peter
found
at
the
table
in
the
corner
alice
clare
millicent
and
percival
galleon
tony
gale
and
his
wife
waiting
there
was
also
a
man
standing
by
alice
chair
and
he
watched
peter
with
amused
eyes
he
held
out
his
hand
and
smiled
how
do
you
do
westcott
he
said
then
with
the
sound
of
his
voice
the
soft
almost
caressing
tilt
of
it
peter
knew
who
it
was
his
mind
flew
back
to
a
day
years
ago
when
he
had
flung
himself
on
the
ground
and
cried
his
soul
out
because
some
one
had
gone
away
cards
he
cried
of
all
wonderful
things
cards
of
dawson
cards
the
magnetic
the
brilliant
cards
with
his
world
and
his
society
and
now
slim
and
dark
and
romantic
as
ever
making
every
one
else
in
the
room
shabby
beside
him
so
that
bobby
white
waistcoat
was
instantly
seen
to
be
hanging
loosely
above
his
shirt
and
peter
trousers
were
short
and
even
the
elegant
percival
had
scarcely
covered
with
perfect
equality
the
ends
of
his
white
tie
instantly
as
though
the
intervening
years
had
never
been
bobby
took
his
second
place
beside
cards
glory
even
percival
intention
of
securing
the
wonderful
rondel
author
of
the
violet
redemption
for
their
table
failed
of
its
effect
they
were
enough
they
did
want
anybody
else
room
for
cardillac
and
he
seized
it
just
as
he
would
have
seized
it
years
ago
at
school
so
he
seized
it
now
their
table
was
caught
into
the
most
dazzling
series
of
adventures
cards
had
been
everywhere
seen
everybody
and
everything
seen
it
all
moreover
with
the
right
kind
of
gaiety
with
an
appreciation
that
was
intelligent
and
also
humorous
there
was
humour
one
moment
and
pathos
the
next
deep
feeling
and
the
wittiest
cynicism
they
were
all
swung
about
europe
and
with
cards
at
their
head
pranced
through
the
cities
of
the
world
meanwhile
peter
fancied
that
once
or
twice
clare
flung
him
a
little
glance
of
appeal
to
ask
for
forgiveness
and
once
they
looked
up
and
smiled
at
one
another
a
tiny
smile
but
it
meant
everything
oh
wo
we
have
a
reconciliation
afterwards
how
could
i
have
said
those
things
do
we
just
love
one
another
when
they
went
upstairs
again
peter
and
cards
exchanged
a
word
you
come
and
see
us
my
dear
old
man
i
should
just
think
so
this
is
the
first
time
been
properly
in
london
for
years
and
now
i
going
to
stay
fancy
you
married
and
successful
and
here
am
i
still
the
you
why
you
can
do
anything
ca
write
hallard
old
boy
and
so
with
a
laugh
they
parted
in
the
cab
afterwards
clare
head
was
buried
in
peter
coat
and
she
sobbed
her
heart
out
how
i
have
been
such
a
beast
peter
peter
darling
it
was
oh
but
it
was
it
shall
never
never
happen
again
but
i
was
frightened
frightened
yes
i
always
think
some
one
going
to
take
you
away
i
understand
all
those
other
people
they
frighten
me
i
want
you
to
myself
just
you
and
i
but
nobody
can
take
me
away
nobody
the
cab
jolted
along
her
hand
was
on
his
knee
and
every
now
and
again
a
lamp
lighted
her
face
for
him
and
then
dropped
it
back
into
darkness
by
the
sharp
pressure
of
her
hand
he
knew
that
she
was
moved
by
an
intensity
of
feeling
swayed
now
by
one
of
those
moods
that
came
to
her
so
strangely
that
it
seemed
that
they
belonged
to
another
personality
look
peter
i
seeing
clearly
as
i
think
i
never
have
before
afraid
not
because
of
you
but
because
of
myself
if
you
knew
here
his
hand
came
down
and
found
hers
if
you
knew
how
i
despise
myself
my
real
self
i
been
spoilt
always
always
always
i
always
known
it
my
real
self
is
ashamed
of
it
but
there
another
side
of
me
that
comes
down
suddenly
and
hides
all
that
and
then
when
that
happens
i
just
want
to
get
what
i
want
and
not
to
be
hurt
and
she
pressed
closer
against
him
and
went
on
in
a
whisper
peter
i
shall
always
care
for
you
more
than
any
one
always
whatever
happens
but
think
a
time
will
come
i
know
it
when
you
have
to
watch
me
to
keep
me
by
you
and
even
let
your
work
go
everything
just
for
a
time
until
i
safe
i
suppose
that
moment
comes
to
most
women
in
their
married
lives
but
to
me
when
it
happens
it
will
be
worse
than
for
most
women
because
i
always
had
my
way
you
let
me
have
my
way
then
simply
clutch
me
be
cruel
brutal
anything
only
do
let
me
go
then
if
you
keep
me
through
that
you
always
keep
to
peter
it
was
almost
as
though
she
were
talking
in
her
sleep
something
there
in
the
old
lumbering
cab
that
was
given
to
her
by
some
one
else
to
say
something
to
which
she
herself
would
not
give
credit
that
all
right
you
darling
you
darling
you
he
covered
her
face
her
eyes
with
kisses
i
never
let
you
go
he
felt
her
quiver
a
little
under
his
arms
do
mind
peter
my
horrible
beastly
character
just
keep
me
for
a
little
train
me
and
then
later
i
be
such
a
wife
to
you
a
wife
then
she
drew
his
head
down
his
lips
touched
her
body
just
above
her
dress
where
her
cloak
parted
she
whispered
there
something
she
raised
her
face
from
his
coat
and
looked
up
at
him
her
cheeks
were
stained
with
crying
and
her
eyes
large
and
dark
held
him
furiously
as
though
he
were
the
one
place
of
safety
he
caught
her
very
close
what
is
it
that
night
long
after
he
triumphant
with
the
glory
of
her
secret
had
fallen
asleep
she
lay
staring
into
the
dark
with
frightened
eyes
chapter
vi
birth
of
the
heir
i
peter
child
was
born
on
a
night
of
frost
when
the
stars
were
hard
and
fierce
and
a
full
moon
dull
gold
flung
high
shadows
upon
the
town
during
the
afternoon
the
fear
that
had
been
in
clare
eyes
for
many
weeks
suddenly
flamed
into
terror
the
doctor
was
sent
for
and
peter
was
banished
from
the
room
peter
looked
ludicrously
pitifully
young
as
he
sat
through
the
evening
in
his
room
at
the
top
of
the
house
staring
in
front
of
him
his
face
grey
with
anxiety
his
broad
shoulders
set
back
as
though
ready
for
a
blow
his
strong
fingers
clutched
the
things
on
his
held
them
dropped
them
just
like
the
hands
of
a
blind
man
about
the
shining
surface
tapping
the
wood
he
saw
her
always
as
he
had
seen
her
last
night
when
she
had
caught
his
arm
crying
if
i
die
peter
oh
peter
if
i
die
and
he
had
comforted
and
stroked
her
hair
warming
her
cold
fingers
how
young
she
was
how
tiny
for
this
suffering
and
it
was
he
he
who
had
brought
it
upon
her
now
she
was
lying
in
her
bed
as
he
had
once
seen
his
mother
lie
with
her
hair
spread
about
the
pillow
her
hands
gripping
the
sheets
her
eyes
wide
and
black
the
vast
hard
closing
her
in
shutting
her
down
she
who
loved
comfort
who
feared
any
pain
who
would
have
life
safe
and
easy
that
she
should
be
forced
the
house
was
very
still
about
him
no
sound
came
up
to
him
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
hush
was
deliberate
the
top
branches
of
the
trees
in
the
little
orchard
touched
his
window
and
tapped
ever
and
again
a
fire
burnt
brightly
he
had
drawn
his
curtains
and
beyond
the
windows
the
great
sheet
of
stars
the
black
houses
the
white
light
of
the
moon
and
there
before
him
what
mockery
the
neat
pages
of
the
stone
house
now
almost
completed
he
stared
into
the
wall
and
saw
her
face
her
hair
upon
the
pillow
her
dark
staring
eyes
once
the
nurse
came
to
him
yes
she
was
suffering
but
all
went
well
it
would
be
about
midnight
perhaps
there
was
no
cause
for
alarm
he
thought
that
the
nurse
looked
at
him
with
compassion
he
turned
fiercely
upon
life
that
it
should
have
brought
this
to
them
when
they
were
both
so
young
at
last
about
ten
able
no
longer
to
endure
the
silence
of
the
house
so
ominous
and
the
gentle
of
the
branches
upon
the
pane
and
the
whispering
crackle
of
the
fire
he
went
out
a
cold
hard
unreal
world
received
him
down
sloane
street
the
lines
of
yellow
lamps
bending
at
last
until
they
met
in
sharp
blue
distance
were
soft
and
misty
against
the
outline
of
the
street
the
houses
were
unreal
in
the
moonlight
a
few
people
passed
quickly
their
footsteps
sharp
in
the
frosty
air
all
the
little
painted
doors
of
sloane
street
were
blind
and
secret
he
passed
through
knightsbridge
into
the
park
as
the
black
trees
closed
him
in
the
fear
of
london
came
tumbling
upon
him
he
remembered
that
day
when
he
had
sat
shivering
on
a
seat
on
the
embankment
and
had
heard
that
note
sinister
threatening
through
the
noise
and
clattering
traffic
he
heard
it
again
now
it
came
from
the
heart
of
the
black
trees
that
lined
the
moonlit
road
a
whisper
a
thread
of
sound
that
accompanied
him
pervaded
him
threatened
him
the
scaly
beast
knew
that
another
victim
was
about
to
be
born
another
woman
was
to
undergo
torture
so
that
when
the
day
came
and
the
scaly
beast
rose
from
its
sleep
then
there
would
be
one
more
to
be
devoured
he
peter
was
to
have
a
child
he
had
longed
for
a
child
ever
since
he
could
remember
he
had
always
loved
children
other
children
but
to
have
one
of
his
own
to
have
something
that
was
his
and
clare
and
theirs
alone
to
have
its
love
to
feel
that
it
depended
upon
them
both
to
watch
it
to
tend
it
life
could
have
no
gift
like
that
but
now
the
child
was
hidden
from
him
he
thought
of
nothing
but
clare
of
her
suffering
and
terror
of
her
waiting
there
so
helplessly
for
the
dreadful
moment
of
supreme
pain
the
love
that
he
had
now
for
clare
was
something
more
tender
more
devoted
than
he
had
ever
felt
for
any
human
being
his
mind
flew
back
fiercely
to
that
night
of
his
first
quarrel
when
she
had
told
him
now
he
was
to
be
punished
for
his
heartlessness
and
cruelty
by
her
loss
his
agony
and
terror
grew
as
he
paced
beneath
the
dark
and
bending
trees
he
sat
down
on
a
seat
at
the
other
end
of
which
was
a
little
man
with
a
bowler
hat
spectacles
and
his
coat
collar
turned
up
he
was
a
shabby
little
man
and
his
thin
bony
hands
beat
restlessly
upon
his
knees
the
little
man
said
good
evening
good
evening
said
peter
staring
desperately
in
front
of
him
it
all
this
blasted
government
i
beg
your
pardon
this
blasted
government
this
income
tax
and
all
it
more
than
that
said
peter
wishing
that
the
man
would
cease
beating
his
knees
with
his
hands
it
them
blasted
stars

gawd
that
what
it
is
curse

peter

and
i

that
what
i

peter
said
nothing
you
can
call
a
bloomin
copper
if
you
want
to
the
little
man
said
it
no
business
of
mine
said
peter
and
he
got
up
and
left
him
all
shadows
only
the
sinister
noise
that
london
makes
is
real
that
and
clare
suffering
he
left
the
park
turned
into
knightsbridge
and
came
upon
a
toyshop
the
shutters
had
not
been
put
up
and
the
lights
of
a
lamp
shone
full
upon
its
windows
against
the
iron
railings
opposite
and
the
high
white
road
these
toys
stood
with
sharp
distinct
outline
behind
the
slanting
light
of
the
glass
there
were
dolls
a
fine
wedding
doll
orange
blossom
lace
and
white
silk
and
from
behind
it
all
the
sharp
pinched
features
and
black
beady
eyes
stared
out
there
was
a
swiss
doll
with
bright
red
cheeks
red
and
green
clothing
and
shoes
with
shining
buckles
then
there
were
the
more
ordinary
dolls
and
gradually
down
the
length
of
the
window
their
clothing
was
taken
from
them
until
at
last
some
wooden
creatures
with
flaring
cheeks
and
brazen
eyes
kicked
their
limbs
and
defied
the
proprieties
he
would
be
a
boy
he
would
not
care
about
dolls
there
were
soldiers
rows
and
rows
of
gleaming
soldiers
they
came
from
a
misty
distance
at
the
top
of
the
shop
window
came
marching
from
the
gates
of
some
dark
mediæval
castle
their
swords
caught
the
lamplight
shining
in
a
line
of
silver
and
the
precision
with
which
they
marched
the
certainty
with
which
they
trod
the
little
bridge
ah
these
were
the
fellows
he
would
be
a
boy
soldiers
would
enchant
him
he
should
have
boxes
boxes
boxes
there
were
many
other
things
in
the
window
teddy
bears
and
animals
with
soft
woolly
stomachs
and
fat
comfortable
legs
and
there
were
ugly
modern
horrors
with
fat
bulging
faces
and
black
hair
erect
like
wire
there
were
little
devils
with
red
tails
there
were
rabbits
that
rode
bicycles
and
monkeys
that
climbed
trees
there
were
drums
big
drums
and
little
drums
trumpets
with
crimson
tassels
and
in
one
corner
a
pyramid
of
balls
balls
of
every
colour
and
at
the
top
of
the
pyramid
a
tiny
ball
of
peacock
blue
hanging
balancing
daintily
supremely
right
in
pose
and
gesture
it
had
gesture
it
caught
peter
eye
peter
stood
with
his
nose
against
the
pane
his
heart
hammering
oh
she
is
suffering
my
god
how
she
is
suffering
and
there
the
little
blue
ball
caught
him
held
him
encouraged
him
i
will
belong
to
your
boy
one
day
it
seemed
to
say
it
shall
be
the
first
thing
i
will
buy
for
him
thought
peter
he
turned
now
amongst
the
light
and
crowds
of
piccadilly
he
walked
on
without
seeing
and
hearing
always
with
that
thought
in
his
heart
she
is
in
terrible
pain
how
can
god
be
so
cruel
and
she
was
so
happy
before
i
came
she
was
so
happy
now
what
have
i
done
to
her
never
before
had
he
felt
so
sharply
so
irretrievably
his
sense
of
responsibility
here
now
before
him
at
this
birth
of
his
child
everything
that
he
had
done
thought
said
everything
that
he
had
been
confronted
him
he
was
only
but
his
shoulders
were
heavy
with
the
confusion
of
his
past
looking
back
upon
it
he
saw
a
helpless
medley
of
indecisions
of
sudden
impulses
sudden
refusals
into
the
skeins
of
it
too
there
seemed
to
be
dragged
the
people
that
had
made
up
his
life
they
faced
him
surrounded
him
bewildered
him
what
right
had
he
thus
encompassed
to
hand
these
things
on
to
another
his
father
his
grandfather
he
saw
always
that
dark
strain
of
hatred
of
madness
of
evil
working
in
their
blood
suppose
that
as
his
boy
grew
he
should
see
this
in
the
young
eyes
suppose
most
horrible
of
all
that
he
should
feel
this
hatred
for
his
son
that
his
grandfather
had
felt
for
his
father
that
his
father
had
felt
for
him
what
had
he
done
he
stopped
staring
confusedly
about
him
the
people
jostled
him
on
every
side
the
old
devils
were
at
him
eat
and
drink
for
we
die
give
it
up
we
too
strong
for
you
and
we
be
too
strong
for
your
son
who
are
you
to
defy
us
come
down
give
it
up
his
white
face
caught
attention
move
along
some
one
shouted
a
man
took
him
by
the
arm
and
led
up
a
dark
side
street
he
turned
his
eyes
and
saw
that
the
man
was
maradick
ii
the
elder
man
felt
that
the
boy
was
trembling
from
head
to
foot
what
the
matter
westcott
anything
i
can
do
for
you
peter
seemed
to
take
him
in
slowly
and
then
with
a
great
effort
to
pull
himself
together
what
you
maradick
where
was
i
i
afraid
i
been
making
a
fool
of
myself
a
church
clock
struck
somewhere
in
the
distance
hullo
i
say
what
that
that
eleven
i
must
get
back
i
ought
to
be
at
home
i
come
with
you
maradick
hailed
a
hansom
and
helped
peter
into
it
for
a
moment
there
was
silence
then
maradick
said
i
hope
everything
all
right
westcott
your
wife
peter
spoke
as
though
he
were
in
a
dream
i
been
waiting
there
all
the
afternoon
she
been
suffering
my
god
it
got
on
my
nerves
she
so
young
they
ought
to
hurt
her
like
he
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
i
know
i
felt
like
that
when
my
first
child
came
it
terrible
awful
and
then
it
over
all
the
pain
and
it
magnificent
glorious
and
then
later
it
so
commonplace
that
you
can
not
believe
that
it
was
ever
either
awful
or
magnificent
fix
your
mind
on
the
glorious
part
of
it
westcott
think
of
this
time
when
your
wife
will
be
so
proud
so
happy
you
both
be
so
proud
so
happy
that
you
never
know
anything
in
life
like
yes

i
know
of

to
be
all
right
but
i

on
my
nerves

was
a
fellow
in
the
park
just
broken
his
wife
head
in
and
then
everything
was
so
quiet
i
could
almost
hear
her
crying
right
away
in
her
he
stopped
a
moment
and
then
went
on
it
what
i
always
wanted
always
to
have
a
boy
and
by
jove
he
be
wonderful
i
tell
you
he
shall
be
we
be
such
pals
he
broke
off
suddenly
you
have
a
boy
no
mine
are
both
girls
getting
on
now
they
soon
be
coming
out
i
should
like
to
have
had
a
boy
maradick
sighed
are
they
an
awful
lot
to
you
no
i
do
suppose
they
are
i
should
have
understood
a
boy
better
but
they
good
girls
i
proud
of
them
in
a
way
but
i
out
so
much
you
peter
faced
the
contrast
here
this
man
with
his
two
girls
and
here
too
he
peter
with
his
agonising
flaming
trial
to
slip
so
soon
into
dull
commonplace
but
did
you
if
you
can
look
so
far
did
you
when
the
first
child
came
funk
it
your
responsibility
i
mean
all
the
things
one
one
ancestors
it
frightening
enough
for
oneself
but
to
hand
it
on
it
nothing
to
do
with
oneself
one
used
that
all
the
child
will
be
on
its
own
legs
thrusting
you
away
before
you
know
where
you
are
it
want
to
claim
its
responsibilities
ancestors
and
all
peter
said
nothing
maradick
went
on
you
know
we
were
talking
one
night
and
were
interrupted
you
in
danger
of
letting
the
things
you
imagine
beat
the
things
you
know
stick
to
the
thing
you
can
grasp
touch
i
know
the
dangers
of
the
others
i
told
you
that
once
in
cornwall
i
the
most
unlikely
person
in
the
world
was
caught
up
by
it
i
never
laughed
at
morbidity
or
nerves
or
insanity
since
there
such
a
jolly
thin
wall
between
the
sanest
most
squire
in
the
country
and
the
maddest
poet
in
bedlam
know
i
been
both
in
the
same
day
it
better
to
be
both
i
believe
if
you
can
keep
one
under
the
other
but
you
keep
it
under
maradick
talked
on
he
saw
that
the
boy
nerves
were
jumping
that
he
was
holding
himself
in
with
the
greatest
difficulty
peter
said
you
do
know
maradick
i
had
to
fight
all
my
life
my
father
grandfather
all
of
them
have
given
in
at
last
and
now
this
child
perhaps
i
shall
see
it
growing
see
him
gradually
learning
to
hate
me
see
myself
hating
him
at
last
my
god
see
him
go
under
drink
deviltry
i
fought
it
i
always
fighting
it
but
good
heavens
man
you
not
going
to
tell
me
that
your
father
your
grandfather
the
rest
of
them
are
stronger
than
you
what
about
your
soul
your
own
blessed
soul
that
ca
be
touched
by
any
living
thing
or
dead
thing
either
if
you
stick
to
it
why
every
man
got
power
enough
in
himself
to
ride
heaven
and
earth
and
all
eternity
if
he
only
believed
he
got
it
ride
your
scruples
man
ride
drive
send
scuttling
believe
in
yourself
and
stick
to
it
courage
maradick
pulled
himself
in
they
were
driving
now
down
the
king
road
the
people
were
pouring
in
a
thick
buzzing
crowd
out
of
the
chelsea
palace
stockbrokers
in
hansom
cabs
talking
like
the
third
act
of
a
problem
play
but
maradick
had
done
his
work
as
they
drove
round
the
corner
past
the
mad
lady
painted
house
he
saw
that
peter
was
calmer
he
had
regained
his
the
little
house
where
peter
lived
was
very
still
the
trees
in
the
orchard
were
stiff
and
dark
beneath
the
stars
peter
spoke
in
a
whisper
maradick
you
done
me
a
lot
of
good
i
sha
forget
good
luck
to
you
maradick
whispered
back
peter
stole
into
the
house
the
little
looked
very
cosy
the
fire
was
burning
the
lamp
lighted
the
thick
curtains
drawn
maria
theresa
smiled
with
all
her
finery
from
the
wall
peter
sat
down
in
front
of
the
fire
maradick
was
right
one
must
have
one
hand
on
the
bridle
the
rider
on
the
lion
again
it
better
that
the
beast
under
you
should
be
a
lion
rather
than
a
donkey
but
let
it
once
fling
you
off
its
back
and
you
done
for
and
maradick
had
said
these
things
maradick
whom
once
peter
had
considered
the
dullest
of
his
acquaintances
well
one
never
knew
about
people
most
of
the
were
explorers
and
vice
versa
if
one
only
understood
them
how
still
the
house
was
what
was
happening
upstairs
he
could
not
go
and
see
he
could
not
move
he
was
held
by
the
stillness
the
doctor
would
come
and
tell
him
he
thought
of
the
toyshop
that
blue
ball
it
would
be
the
first
thing
that
he
would
buy
for
the
boy
and
then
soldiers
soldiers
that
hurt
him
that
he
could
lick
the
paint
from
now
the
little
silver
clock
ticked
he
was
so
terribly
tired
he
had
never
been
tired
like
this
before
the
stillness
pressed
upon
the
house
every
sound
the
distant
rattling
of
some
cab
the
faint
murmur
of
trams
was
stifled
extinguished
the
orchard
seemed
to
press
in
upon
the
house
darker
and
darker
grew
the
forest
about
it
the
stars
were
shut
out
the
moon
the
world
was
dead
then
into
this
sealed
and
hidden
silence
a
voice
crying
from
an
upper
room
suddenly
fell
a
woman
in
the
abandonment
of
utter
pain
pain
beyond
all
control
was
screaming
somewhere
above
that
dark
forest
that
pressed
in
upon
the
house
a
bird
of
prey
hovered
it
hung
for
a
moment
it
descended
its
talons
were
fixed
upon
her
flesh
then
again
it
ascended
shriek
after
shriek
bursting
the
silence
chasing
the
shadows
flooding
the
secrecy
with
horrible
light
beat
like
blows
upon
the
walls
of
the
house
rose
fell
rose
again
peter
was
standing
his
back
against
the
wall
his
hands
spread
out
his
face
grey
my
god
my
god
oh
my
god
the
sweat
poured
from
his
forehead
once
more
there
was
silence
but
now
it
was
ominous
awful
the
little
silver
clock
ticked
peter
body
stood
stretched
against
the
wall
he
faced
the
door
hours
hours
passed
he
did
not
move
the
screaming
had
many
years
ago
ceased
the
doctor
a
cheerful
man
with
blue
eyes
and
a
little
bristling
moustache
came
in
a
fine
boy
westcott
i
congratulate
you
you
might
see
your
wife
for
a
moment
if
you
cared
stood
it
remarkably
well
slowly
the
forest
dark
and
terrible
moved
away
from
the
house
very
faintly
again
could
be
heard
the
distant
rattling
of
some
cab
the
murmur
of
trams
chapter
vii
declaration
of
happiness
i
extracts
from
letters
that
bobby
galleon
wrote
to
alice
galleon
about
this
time
but
of
course
i
am
sorrier
than
i
can
say
that
it
so
dull
that
due
to
charity
my
dear
and
if
you
will
go
and
fling
yourself
into
the
depths
of
yorkshire
because
a
girl
like
ola
hunting
chooses
to
think
she
unhappy
and
lonely
you
only
yourself
to
thank
moreover
there
your
husband
to
be
considered
i
do
suppose
for
a
single
instant
that
he
really
prefers
to
be
left
alone
with
his
infant
son
mind
you
howling
at
the
present
moment
because
his
nurse
wo
let
him
swallow
the
glass
marbles
and
you
can
picture
to
yourself
if
you
want
to
make
yourself
thoroughly
unhappy
your
robert
sitting
melancholy
throughout
the
long
evening
alone
desolate
creeping
to
bed
somewhere
about
ten
so
there
we
are
you
bored
to
death
and
i
no
one
to
growl
at
when
i
come
back
from
the
city
all
ola
hunting
fault
wring
the
neck
meanwhile
here
i
sit
and
every
evening
i
write
whatever
comes
into
my
head
and
never
look
back
on
it
again
but
stick
it
into
an
envelope
and
send
it
to
you
you
know
me
too
well
by
now
to
be
disappointed
at
anything
i
quite
sure
that
if
you
were
here
with
me
now
sitting
in
that
chair
opposite
me
and
sewing
for
all
you
were
worth
that
the
thing
that
we
be
talking
about
would
be
peter
if
therefore
these
scrawls
are
full
of
peter
you
wo
mind
i
know
he
immensely
occupying
my
attention
just
now
and
you
love
him
as
truly
and
deeply
as
i
do
so
that
if
i
go
on
at
length
about
him
you
excuse
it
on
that
score
you
who
know
me
better
than
any
one
else
in
the
world
know
that
in
my
most
secret
heart
i
flatter
myself
on
my
ability
as
a
psychologist
i
remember
when
i
told
you
first
how
you
laughed
but
i
think
since
then
you
come
round
not
a
little
and
although
we
both
keep
it
to
ourselves
it
a
little
secret
that
you
a
tiny
bit
proud
of
i
can
see
how
brother
percival
or
young
tony
gale
or
even
dear
peter
himself
would
mock
if
i
told
them
of
this
ambition
of
mine
dear
stupid
old
bobby
is
the
way
they
think
of
me
and
i
know
it
perpetual
wonder
and
also
i
think
a
little
her
comfort
that
i
should
be
so
lacking
in
brilliance
when
percival
and
millie
are
so
full
of
it
you
know
peter
attitude
to
me
in
these
things
you
seen
it
often
enough
he
patronising
he
ca
help
it
that
is
he
considers
my
line
in
the
least
and
let
me
once
begin
to
talk
to
him
of
stocks
and
shares
and
he
open
all
his
ears
well
i
ca
blame
him
but
i
do
think
these
writers
and
people
are
inclined
to
draw
their
line
a
little
too
sharply
with
their
philistines
great
big
gulf
please
and
artists
at
any
rate
here
goes
for
my
psychology
and
good
luck
to
it
peter
in
fact
is
so
interesting
a
subject
if
one
sees
anything
of
him
at
all
that
i
believe
he
draw
speculation
out
of
any
one
there
was
old
maradick
talking
about
him
the
other
night
fascinated
by
him
and
understanding
him
most
amazingly
well
another
instance
of
your
philistine
and
artist
mixed
but
i
knew
him
and
knew
him
jolly
well
too
when
he
was
about
twelve
so
that
i
really
get
a
pull
over
the
rest
of
you
there
for
it
adds
of
course
immensely
to
the
interest
and
if
ever
child
was
father
of
the
man
peter
was
you
know
how
we
both
funked
that
marriage
of
his
for
him
you
because
you
knew
clare
so
well
i
because
i
knew
peter
and
then
for
a
time
it
really
seemed
that
we
were
both
entirely
wrong
clare
is
a
far
simpler
personality
than
peter
and
if
you
work
along
one
or
two
recognised
lines
let
her
have
her
way
do
frighten
her
above
all
keep
her
conventional
it
all
right
clare
was
and
is
awfully
in
love
with
him
and
he
madly
with
her
of
course
and
that
helped
everything
along
you
know
how
relieved
we
both
were
and
indeed
it
seemed
for
a
time
that
it
was
going
to
be
the
making
of
both
of
them
going
to
make
clare
braver
and
peter
less
morbid
well
it
since
you
been
away
that
everything
happened
although
the
baby
was
born
some
weeks
before
you
went
it
only
lately
that
clare
has
been
up
and
about
she
perfectly
well
and
the
splendid
promises
to
be
a
tremendous
fellow
and
as
healthy
as
possible
you
can
imagine
a
little
the
effect
of
it
all
on
clare
i
suppose
there
any
girl
in
london
been
so
wrapped
in
cotton
wool
all
her
life
and
that
old
ass
of
a
father
and
still
more
irritating
ass
of
a
mother
would
go
on
wrapping
her
still
if
they
had
their
way
the
fuss
they
both
made
about
this
whole
business
is
simply
incredible
especially
when
the
man
a
doctor
and
brings
lord
knows
how
many
children
into
the
world
every
week
of
his
life
but
it
all
been
awfully
bad
for
clare
of
course
she
was
frightened
frightened
out
of
her
wits
it
the
very
first
time
life
ever
had
its
wrappings
off
for
her
and
that
in
itself
of
course
is
a
tremendously
good
thing
but
you
ca
unfortunately
wrap
any
one
up
for
all
those
years
and
then
take
the
wrappings
off
and
not
deliver
a
shock
to
the
system
of
course
there
a
shock
and
it
just
this
shock
that
i
so
afraid
of
afraid
of
it
for
one
thing
because
peter
so
entirely
oblivious
of
it
he
was
in
an
agony
of
terror
on
the
day
that
the
baby
was
born
but
once
it
was
there
well
and
healthy
and
promising
fear
vanished
he
could
only
see
room
for
glory
and
glory
he
does
i
can
not
tell
you
what
that
boy
is
like
about
the
baby
at
present
he
thinks
day
and
night
of
nothing
else
it
is
the
most
terrific
thing
to
watch
his
feeling
about
it
and
meanwhile
he
takes
it
for
granted
that
clare
feels
the
same
well
she
does
i
have
been
in
a
good
deal
during
these
last
few
days
and
she
stranger
than
words
can
say
does
see
the
child
if
she
can
help
it
loves
it
worships
it
when
it
is
there
and
is
terrified
of
it
i
saw
a
look
in
her
eyes
when
she
was
nursing
it
yesterday
that
was
sheer
undiluted
terror
she
been
frightened
out
of
her
life
and
if
i
know
her
the
least
little
bit
she
absolutely
made
up
her
mind
never
to
be
frightened
like
that
again
she
is
going
to
hurl
herself
into
a
perfect
whirlpool
of
excitement
and
entertainment
and
drag
peter
with
her
if
she
can
meanwhile
behind
that
hard
little
head
of
hers
making
plans
just
as
fast
as
she
can
make
them
i
believe
she
looks
on
life
now
as
though
it
had
broken
the
compact
that
she
made
with
it
a
compact
that
things
should
always
be
easy
comfortable
above
all
never
threatening
the
present
must
be
calm
but
the
future
absolutely
got
to
be
and
i
believe
although
she
loves
him
devotedly
in
the
depths
of
her
strange
little
soul
that
she
half
blames
peter
for
all
of
this
disturbance
and
that
there
are
a
great
many
things
about
him
his
earlier
life
his
earlier
friends
even
his
work
that
she
would
strip
from
him
if
she
could
well
enough
for
the
present
i
do
know
nonsense
there
here
into
the
envelope
it
all
goes
i
been
talking
to
you
for
an
hour
and
a
half
and
that
something
ii
i
just
come
in
from
dinner
with
peter
and
clare
and
feel
inclined
to
talk
to
you
for
hours
ahead
however
that
i
ca
do
so
i
shall
write
to
you
instead
and
you
to
regard
it
all
as
a
continuation
of
the
things
that
i
said
in
last
night
letter
i
am
as
interested
as
ever
and
indeed
after
this
evening
dinner
more
interested
the
odd
thing
about
it
all
is
that
peter
is
so
completely
oblivious
to
any
change
that
may
be
going
on
in
clare
his
whole
mind
is
centred
now
on
the
baby
he
can
not
have
enough
of
it
and
it
was
he
and
not
clare
who
took
me
up
after
dinner
to
see
it
sleeping
you
remember
that
they
had
some
kind
of
a
dispute
about
the
name
of
the
boy
at
the
time
of
the
christening
peter
insisted
that
it
should
be
stephen
after
i
suppose
that
odd
cornish
friend
of
his
and
clare
weak
and
ill
though
she
was
objected
with
all
her
might
i
do
know
why
she
took
this
so
much
to
heart
but
it
was
all
i
suppose
part
of
that
odd
hatred
that
she
has
of
peter
earlier
life
and
earlier
friends
she
has
never
met
the
man
brant
but
i
think
that
she
fancies
that
he
is
going
to
swoop
down
one
of
these
days
and
carry
peter
off
on
a
broomstick
or
something
she
gave
in
about
the
name
indeed
i
have
never
seen
peter
more
determined
but
i
think
nevertheless
that
she
broods
over
it
and
remembers
it
my
dear
i
am
as
sorry
for
her
as
i
can
be
there
she
stands
loving
peter
with
all
her
heart
and
soul
terrified
out
of
her
wits
at
the
possibilities
that
life
is
presenting
to
her
hating
peter
friends
at
one
moment
his
work
the
next
the
baby
the
next
exactly
like
some
one
walking
on
a
in
his
sleep
and
suddenly
waking
and
discovering
peter
a
more
difficult
question
he
too
riotously
happy
just
at
the
moment
to
listen
to
a
word
from
any
one
his
relation
to
the
child
is
really
the
most
touching
thing
you
ever
saw
and
really
the
child
considering
that
it
has
scarcely
begun
to
exist
has
a
feeling
for
him
in
the
most
wonderful
way
it
is
as
good
as
gold
when
he
is
there
and
follows
him
with
its
eyes
it
does
pay
much
attention
to
clare
i
think
it
knows
that
she
frightened
of
it
yes
peter
is
quite
riotously
happy
you
know
that
stone
house
is
coming
out
next
week
there
is
to
be
a
supper
party
at
the
galleons
myself
launce
maradick
the
gales
some
woman
he
knew
at
that
cardillac
and
and
rossiter
by
the
way
cardillac
is
there
a
great
deal
and
i
am
both
glad
and
sorry
he
is
very
good
for
clare
and
not
at
all
good
for
peter
he
seems
to
understand
clare
in
the
most
wonderful
way
far
better
than
peter
does
he
brings
her
out
helps
her
to
be
broader
and
really
i
think
explains
peter
to
her
and
helps
things
along
his
influence
on
peter
is
all
the
other
way
peter
of
course
worships
him
just
as
he
used
to
do
in
the
old
days
at
school
and
cards
always
liked
being
worshipped
he
has
an
elegance
a
that
dear
peter
finds
entrancing
but
of
course
peter
worth
the
dozen
of
him
any
day
of
the
week
he
drags
out
all
peter
worst
side
i
wonder
whether
you
understand
what
i
mean
when
i
say
that
peter
is
to
be
happy
at
any
rate
not
yet
he
got
something
too
big
too
tremendous
in
him
to
be
carved
easily
into
any
one
of
our
humdrum
conventional
shapes
he
takes
things
so
hard
that
he
intended
to
take
more
than
one
thing
at
a
time
and
here
he
is
with
clare
and
cards
both
as
it
seems
to
me
in
a
conspiracy
to
pull
him
into
a
thousand
little
bits
and
to
fling
each
little
bit
to
a
different
he
ought
to
be
getting
at
his
work
and
he
is
getting
at
it
at
all
stone
house
is
coming
out
next
week
and
it
may
be
all
right
but
i
do
mind
betting
that
the
next
one
suffers
if
he
were
in
a
kind
of
dream
he
see
it
all
himself
and
indeed
i
think
that
he
wake
one
day
soon
and
see
that
a
thousand
ridiculous
things
are
getting
in
between
him
and
his
proper
life
he
was
leading
his
proper
life
in
those
days
at
dawson
when
they
were
beating
him
at
home
and
hating
him
at
school
and
it
was
that
old
bookshop
and
the
queer
people
he
met
in
it
that
produced
hallard
he
so
amazingly
young
in
the
ways
of
the
world
so
eager
to
make
friends
with
everybody
so
delighted
with
an
entirely
superficial
butterfly
like
cards
so
devotedly
attached
to
his
wife
that
i
must
confess
that
the
outlook
seems
to
me
bad
there
going
to
be
a
tremendous
in
a
minute
and
it
not
going
to
be
easy
for
the
boy
nor
indeed
for
clare
i
hope
that
you
do
feel
so
far
removed
from
this
in
your
yorkshire
desert
that
it
has
no
interest
for
you
but
i
know
how
devoted
you
are
to
peter
and
one
does
want
to
see
the
boy
turned
into
the
society
novelist
creature
the
kind
of
creature
god
forgive
me
that
brother
percival
is
certain
to
become
you
probably
say
when
you
read
this
that
i
am
trying
to
drag
out
all
the
morbid
side
of
peter
and
make
him
the
melancholy
introspective
creature
that
he
used
to
be
in
fits
and
starts
when
you
first
knew
him
of
course
that
the
last
thing
i
want
to
do
but
work
to
a
man
of
peter
temperament
is
the
one
rock
that
can
save
him
he
has
i
do
believe
a
touch
of
genius
in
him
somewhere
and
i
believe
that
if
he
allowed
to
follow
devoutly
and
with
pain
and
anguish
maybe
his
art
he
be
a
great
creature
a
great
man
and
a
great
writer
but
he
in
the
making
too
eager
to
please
too
eager
to
care
for
every
one
too
desperately
down
if
he
thinks
things
are
going
badly
with
him
i
notice
that
he
has
been
to
see
my
father
lately
i
think
too
that
all
this
reviewing
is
bad
for
him
other
people
novels
pouring
upon
him
in
an
avalanche
must
take
something
from
the
freshness
of
his
own
anyhow
i
robert
galleon
your
clever
and
penetrating
husband
scent
much
danger
and
trouble
ahead
clare
simply
out
of
love
for
him
and
anxiety
for
herself
will
i
know
do
all
she
can
to
drag
him
from
the
thing
that
he
should
follow
and
cards
will
help
her
out
of
sheer
mischief
i
verily
believe
on
their
own
heads
be
it
as
to
the
carpets
you
asked
me
to
go
and
look
at
iii
and
now
for
the
supper
party
although
there
a
whole
day
behind
me
i
still
quivering
under
the
excitement
of
it
as
i
tell
you
about
it
it
will
in
all
probability
declare
itself
as
a
perfectly
ordinary
affair
and
indeed
i
think
that
you
should
have
been
there
yourself
to
have
realised
the
emotion
of
it
but
i
try
and
give
it
you
word
for
word
i
was
kept
in
the
city
and
arrived
late
and
they
were
all
there
launce
twinkling
all
over
with
kindness
maradick
in
his
best
stock
exchange
manner
the
gales
janet
gale
perfectly
lovely
the
old
rossiters
cards
shining
with
a
mixture
of
enterprise
and
knowledge
of
the
world
and
last
of
all
a
very
pale
rather
nervous
untidy
irish
woman
a
miss
monogue
clare
was
so
radiantly
happy
that
i
knew
that
she
was
happy
at
all
had
obviously
taken
a
great
deal
of
trouble
about
her
hair
and
had
it
all
piled
up
on
the
top
of
her
head
and
looked
wonderful
i
ca
describe
these
things
but
you
know
that
when
bent
on
giving
an
impression
she
seems
to
stand
on
her
toes
all
the
time
well
she
was
standing
on
every
kind
of
toe
moral
physical
emotional
last
night
finally
there
was
peter
looking
as
though
his
evening
dress
had
been
made
for
something
quite
different
from
social
dinner
parties
it
fitted
all
right
but
it
was
too
comfortable
to
be
smart
he
looked
beside
cards
like
a
good
serviceable
cob
up
against
the
smartest
of
hunters
peter
rough
bullet
head
the
way
that
he
stands
with
his
legs
wide
apart
and
his
thick
body
holding
itself
deliberately
still
with
an
effort
as
though
he
were
on
board
ship
and
then
that
smile
that
won
all
our
hearts
ages
ago
right
out
of
the
centre
of
his
brown
eyes
first
and
then
curving
his
mouth
at
last
seizing
all
his
body
but
always
in
spite
of
it
a
little
appealing
a
little
sad
somewhere
ca
you
see
him
and
cards
slim
straight
dark
beautifully
clothed
beautifully
witty
and
i
am
convinced
beautifully
insincere
ca
you
see
cards
say
evening
to
me
with
that
same
charm
that
same
ease
that
same
contempt
that
he
had
when
we
were
at
school
together
bobby
galleon
an
honest
good
fellow
but
dull
mon
dieu
dull
he
rather
likes
french
phrases
ca
you
hear
him
saying
it
well
from
the
very
first
there
was
something
in
the
air
we
were
all
excited
even
old
rossiter
and
the
pale
irish
creature
whom
i
remembered
afterwards
i
had
met
that
day
when
i
went
to
that
boarding
house
after
peter
clare
was
quite
extraordinary
i
have
never
seen
her
anything
like
it
she
talked
the
whole
time
laughed
almost
shouted
the
only
person
she
treated
stiffly
was
cards
i
do
think
she
likes
him
he
was
at
his
most
brilliant
really
wonderful
and
i
liked
him
better
than
i
ever
liked
him
before
he
seemed
to
have
a
genuine
pleasure
in
peter
happiness
and
i
believe
he
as
fond
of
the
boy
as
he
able
to
be
of
any
one
a
copy
of
stone
house
was
given
to
each
of
us
i
have
had
time
to
look
at
mine
yet
and
i
suppose
the
combination
of
the
baby
and
the
book
moved
us
all
besides
clare
and
peter
both
looked
so
absurdly
young
such
children
to
have
had
so
many
adventures
already
you
can
imagine
how
riotous
we
got
when
i
tell
you
that
dessert
found
rossiter
with
a
paper
cap
on
her
head
and
janet
gale
was
singing
some
cornish
song
or
other
to
the
delight
of
the
company
miss
monogue
and
i
were
the
quietest
i
should
think
that
she
one
of
the
best
and
i
saw
her
look
at
peter
once
or
twice
in
a
way
that
showed
how
strongly
she
felt
about
him
well
old
girl
i
bothered
if
i
can
explain
the
kind
of
anxiety
that
came
over
me
after
a
time
you
think
me
a
regular
professional
croaker
but
really
i
suppose
at
bottom
it
was
some
sort
of
feeling
that
the
whole
thing
this
shouting
and
cheering
and
thumping
the
table
was
premature
and
then
i
suppose
it
was
partly
my
knowledge
of
peter
it
was
like
him
to
behave
in
this
sort
of
way
he
himself
excited
agitated
by
something
altogether
foreign
to
him
i
could
have
thought
that
he
was
drunk
if
i
had
known
that
he
touched
any
liquor
whatever
but
a
man
of
peter
temperament
pays
for
this
sort
of
thing
it
is
the
sort
of
way
he
meant
to
take
life
whatever
the
reason
may
have
been
i
know
that
i
felt
suddenly
outside
the
whole
business
and
most
awfully
depressed
i
think
miss
monogue
felt
exactly
the
same
by
the
time
the
wine
was
on
the
table
all
i
wanted
was
to
get
right
away
it
was
almost
as
though
i
had
been
looking
on
at
something
that
i
was
ashamed
to
see
there
was
a
kind
of
deliberate
determination
about
their
happiness
and
clare
little
body
with
her
hair
on
the
verge
as
it
seemed
of
a
positive
downfall
had
something
quite
pitiful
in
its
deliberate
rejoicing
such
a
child
my
dear
i
never
realised
how
young
until
last
night
such
a
child
and
needing
some
one
so
much
older
and
wiser
than
peter
to
manage
it
all
well
there
i
was
hating
it
when
the
final
moment
came
cards
got
up
and
in
one
of
the
wittiest
little
speeches
you
ever
heard
in
your
life
proposed
peter
health
alluded
to
hallard
then
clare
then
the
son
and
heir
a
kind
of
back
fling
at
old
dawson
and
then
last
of
all
an
apostrophe
to
stone
house
all
glory
and
honour
well
it
was
most
neatly
done
and
we
all
sat
back
silent
for
peter
reply
the
dear
boy
stood
there
all
flushed
and
excited
with
his
hair
pushed
back
off
his
forehead
and
began
the
most
extraordinary
speech
i
ever
heard
i
ca
possibly
give
you
the
effect
of
it
at
secondhand
in
the
mere
repetition
of
it
there
was
little
more
than
that
he
was
wildly
madly
happy
that
there
was
no
one
in
the
world
as
happy
as
he
that
now
at
last
the
gods
had
given
him
all
that
he
had
ever
wanted
let
them
now
do
their
worst
and
so
crying
flung
his
glass
over
his
shoulder
and
smashed
it
on
to
the
wall
behind
him
i
can
not
possibly
tell
you
how
sinister
how
ominous
the
whole
thing
suddenly
was
it
swooped
down
upon
all
of
us
like
a
black
cloud
credit
me
if
you
will
with
a
highly
strung
bundle
of
nerves
not
so
solid
as
i
seem
know
well
enough
but
it
seemed
to
me
at
that
moment
that
peter
was
defying
consciously
with
his
heart
in
his
mouth
a
world
of
devils
and
that
he
was
cognisant
of
all
of
them
the
thing
was
conscious
that
was
the
awful
thing
about
it
i
could
swear
that
he
was
seeing
far
beyond
all
of
us
that
he
was
hurling
his
happiness
at
something
that
he
had
there
before
him
as
clearly
as
i
have
you
before
me
now
it
was
defiance
and
i
believe
the
minute
after
uttering
it
he
would
have
liked
to
have
rushed
upstairs
to
see
that
his
baby
was
safe
be
that
as
it
may
we
all
felt
it
every
one
of
us
the
party
was
clouded
cards
and
clare
did
their
best
to
brighten
things
up
again
and
peter
and
tony
and
janet
gale
played
silly
games
and
made
a
great
deal
of
noise
but
the
spirit
was
gone
i
left
very
early
miss
monogue
came
away
at
the
same
time
she
spoke
to
me
before
she
said
know
that
you
are
an
old
friend
of
peter
i
am
so
fond
of
him
we
all
are
at
brockett
it
is
often
that
we
see
him
i
know
that
you
will
be
his
true
friend
in
every
sense
of
the
word
and
help
him
as
he
ought
to
be
helped
it
is
so
little
that
i
can
do
her
voice
was
sad
i
am
afraid
she
suffers
a
great
deal
she
is
evidently
greatly
attached
to
peter
i
liked
her
well
you
in
your
sober
way
will
say
that
this
is
all
a
great
deal
of
nonsense
why
should
peter
if
he
wishes
say
that
he
is
happy
all
i
can
say
is
that
if
you
yourself
had
been
there
chapter
viii
blinds
down
i
it
was
not
until
stephen
westcott
had
rejoiced
in
the
glories
so
novel
and
so
thrilling
of
his
first
birthday
and
the
stone
house
had
been
six
months
before
the
public
eye
that
the
effect
of
this
second
book
could
be
properly
estimated
second
books
are
the
most
surely
foredoomed
creatures
in
all
creation
and
there
are
many
excellent
reasons
for
this
they
will
assuredly
disappoint
the
expectations
of
those
who
enjoyed
the
first
work
and
the
author
will
in
all
probability
have
been
tempted
by
his
earlier
success
to
try
his
wings
further
than
they
are
as
yet
able
to
carry
him
peter
failure
was
only
partial
there
was
no
question
that
the
stone
house
was
a
remarkable
book
had
it
been
peter
first
novel
it
must
have
made
an
immense
stir
it
showed
that
he
was
in
no
kind
of
way
a
man
of
one
book
and
it
gave
in
its
london
scenes
proof
that
its
author
was
not
limited
to
one
kind
of
life
and
one
kind
of
background
there
were
chapters
that
were
fuller
wiser
in
every
way
more
mature
than
anything
in
reuben
but
it
was
amazingly
unequal
there
were
places
in
it
that
had
no
kind
of
life
at
all
at
times
peter
appeared
to
have
beheld
his
scenes
and
characters
through
a
mist
to
have
been
dragged
right
away
from
any
kind
of
vision
of
the
book
to
have
written
wildly
blindly
the
opinion
of
launce
was
perhaps
the
soundest
that
it
was
possible
to
have
because
that
good
lady
in
spite
of
her
affection
for
peter
had
a
critical
judgment
that
was
partly
literary
partly
commercial
and
partly
human
she
always
judged
a
book
first
with
her
brain
then
with
her
heart
and
lastly
with
her
knowledge
of
her
fellow
creatures
it
may
pay
better
than
hallard
she
said
there
more
love
interest
and
it
ends
happily
some
of
it
is
beautifully
written
some
of
it
quite
unspeakably
but
really
peter
it
the
most
uneven
thing
i
ever
read
again
and
again
one
is
caught
held
stirred
then
suddenly
you
slip
away
altogether
you
are
there
at

ringer

first
chapters
and

last
chapters

middle

you
but
it
will
sell

bank
clerks

but
the
wild
bits

the
wild
bits
are
splendid
that
bit
about
the
rocks
at
night
you
do
know
much
about
women
yet
your
girls
are
awfully
bad
by
the
way
do
you
know
that
mary
hollins
is
only
getting
advance
next
time
all
she
can
get
that
last
thing
was
so
shocking
i
hear
that
that
book
about
an
immoral
violet
by
that
new
young
man
rondel
is
it
is
still
having
a
most
enormous
success
i
know
that
barratt
got
in
a
whole
batch
of
new
copies
last
night
i
hear
launce
was
disappointed
peter
could
tell
well
enough
he
received
some
laudatory
reviews
some
letters
from
strangers
some
adulation
from
people
who
knew
nothing
whatever
he
did
not
know
what
it
was
exactly
that
he
had
expected
but
whatever
it
was
that
he
wanted
he
did
not
get
it
he
was
dissatisfied
he
began
to
blame
his
publishers
they
had
not
advertised
him
enough
he
even
secretly
cherished
that
most
hopeless
of
all
convictions
that
his
book
was
above
the
heads
of
the
public
he
noticed
also
that
wherever
he
might
be
this
name
of
rondel
appeared
before
him
rondel
with
his
foolish
face
and
thin
mother
in
black
was
obviously
the
young
man
of
the
moment
in
the
literary
advertisements
of
any
of
the
weekly
papers
you
might
see
the
violet
novel
in
its
tenth
edition
and
the
stone
house
by
peter
westcott
second
edition
selling
rapidly
he
was
again
bewildered
as
he
had
been
after
the
publication
of
reuben
hallard
by
the
extraordinary
variance
of
opinions
amongst
reviewers
and
amongst
his
own
personal
friends
one
man
told
him
that
he
had
no
style
that
he
must
learn
the
meaning
and
feeling
of
words
another
told
him
that
his
characters
were
weak
but
that
his
style
was
splendid
a
real
knowledge
of
the
value
and
meaning
of
some
one
told
him
that
he
knew
nothing
at
all
about
women
and
some
one
else
that
his
women
were
by
far
the
best
part
of
his
work
the
variety
was
endless
amongst
those
who
had
appeared
to
him
giants
there
was
the
same
uncertainty
he
seemed
too
to
detect
with
the
older
men
a
desire
to
praise
those
parts
of
his
work
that
resembled
their
own
productions
and
to
blame
anything
that
gave
promise
of
originality
for
himself
it
seemed
to
him
that
launce
opinion
was
nearest
the
truth
there
were
parts
of
it
that
were
good
chapters
that
were
better
than
anything
in
reuben
hallard
and
then
again
there
were
many
chapters
where
he
saw
it
all
in
a
fog
groped
dimly
for
his
characters
pushed
as
it
seemed
to
him
away
from
their
lives
and
interests
by
the
actual
lives
and
interests
of
the
real
people
about
him
this
led
him
to
think
of
clare
and
here
he
was
suddenly
arrested
by
a
perception
now
only
dimly
grasped
of
a
change
in
her
attitude
to
his
writings
he
dated
it
thinking
of
it
now
for
the
first
time
from
the
birth
of
young
stephen
or
was
it
not
earlier
than
that
on
that
evening
when
they
had
met
cards
at
that
supper
party
on
that
evening
of
their
first
quarrel
in
the
early
days
how
well
he
remembered
clare
enthusiasm
a
little
extravagant
it
seemed
now
then
during
the
first
year
of
their
married
life
she
had
wanted
to
know
everything
about
the
making
of
the
stone
it
was
almost
as
though
it
had
been
a
cake
or
a
pie
and
he
knew
that
he
had
found
her
questions
difficult
to
answer
and
that
he
had
had
it
driven
in
upon
him
that
it
was
not
really
because
she
was
interested
in
the
subtleties
of
his
art
that
she
enquired
but
because
of
her
own
personal
affection
for
him
if
he
had
been
making
boots
or
a
suit
of
clothes
it
would
have
been
just
the
same
then
when
the
stone
house
appeared
her
eagerness
for
its
success
had
been
tremendous
there
was
nothing
she
would
not
do
to
help
it
along
but
that
he
somewhat
ironically
discovered
was
because
she
liked
success
and
the
things
that
success
brought
then
when
the
book
had
not
succeeded
or
only
so
very
little
her
interest
had
of
a
sudden
subsided
oh
i
suppose
you
got
to
go
and
do
your
silly
old
writing
i
think
you
might
come
out
with
me
just
this
afternoon
it
is
often
that
i
ask
anything
of
you
he
did
not
believe
that
she
had
ever
really
finished
the
stone
she
pretended
that
she
had
the
end
was
simply
perfect
but
she
was
vague
nebulous
he
found
the
marker
in
her
copy
some
fifty
pages
before
the
end
she
was
so
easily
impressed
by
every
one
whom
she
met
that
perhaps
the
laughing
attitude
of
cards
to
peter
books
had
something
to
do
with
it
all
cards
affected
to
despise
anything
to
do
with
work
here
gone
let
us
eat
and
drink
dear
old
peter
grubbing
away
upstairs
i
say
westcott
let
go
and
rag
him
and
then
they
had
come
and
invaded
his
room
at
the
top
of
the
house
and
sometimes
he
had
been
glad
and
had
flung
his
work
down
as
though
it
were
of
no
account
and
then
afterwards
in
the
middle
of
some
he
had
been
suddenly
ashamed
deeply
bitterly
ashamed
as
though
he
had
actually
wounded
those
white
pages
lying
up
there
in
his
quiet
room
he
was
at
this
time
like
a
man
jostled
and
pushed
and
turned
about
at
some
riotous
fair
looking
now
this
way
now
that
absorbed
by
a
thousand
sights
a
thousand
sounds
and
always
through
it
all
feeling
bitterly
in
his
heart
that
something
dear
to
him
somewhere
in
some
place
of
silence
was
dying
well
hang
it
all
at
any
rate
there
was
the
child
ii
at
any
rate
there
was
the
child
and
what
a
child
did
any
one
ever
have
a
baby
like
it
so
fat
and
round
and
white
with
its
head
already
covered
with
faint
golden
silk
its
eyes
grey
and
wondering
with
its
sudden
gravities
its
amazing
joys
and
terrific
humour
the
beauty
of
its
stepping
away
as
it
did
suddenly
without
any
warning
behind
a
myriad
mists
and
curtains
into
some
other
land
that
it
knew
of
how
amazing
to
watch
it
as
it
slowly
forgot
all
the
things
that
it
had
come
into
the
world
remembering
as
it
slowly
realised
all
the
laws
that
this
new
order
of
things
demanded
of
its
obedience
could
any
one
who
had
been
present
ever
forget
its
crow
of
ecstasy
at
the
first
shaft
of
sunlight
that
it
ever
beheld
at
its
first
realisation
of
the
blue
shining
ball
that
peter
bought
at
its
first
vision
through
the
window
of
falling
snow
peter
was
drunk
with
this
amazing
wonder
all
the
facts
of
life
even
clare
and
his
work
faded
before
this
new
presence
for
whose
existence
he
had
been
responsible
it
had
been
one
of
the
astonishing
things
about
clare
that
she
had
taken
the
child
so
quietly
he
had
seen
her
thrilled
by
musical
comedy
by
a
dance
at
the
palace
music
hall
by
the
trumpery
pathos
of
a
novel
before
this
marvel
she
stood
it
seemed
to
him
without
any
emotion
sometimes
he
thought
that
if
it
had
not
been
for
his
reminder
she
would
not
have
gone
to
kiss
the
child
goodnight
there
were
many
occasions
when
he
knew
with
wonder
and
almost
dismay
that
she
was
afraid
of
it
and
once
when
they
had
been
in
the
nursery
together
and
young
stephen
had
cried
and
kicked
his
heels
in
a
tempest
of
rage
she
had
seemed
almost
to
cling
to
peter
for
protection
there
were
occasions
when
peter
fancied
that
the
baby
seemed
the
elder
of
the
two
it
was
at
any
rate
certain
that
stephen
westcott
was
not
so
afraid
of
his
mother
as
his
mother
was
of
him
and
yet
peter
fancied
that
could
clare
only
get
past
this
strange
nervous
fear
she
would
love
the
baby
passionately
would
love
him
with
that
same
fierceness
of
passion
that
she
flung
curiously
now
and
again
upon
peter
himself
let
me
be
promised
she
seemed
to
say
that
i
will
never
have
any
trouble
or
sorrow
with
my
son
and
i
will
love
him
meanwhile
she
went
into
every
excitement
that
life
could
provide
for
her
it
was
on
a
march
afternoon
of
early
spring
after
a
lonely
tea
clare
was
out
at
one
of
her
parties
that
peter
went
up
to
the
nursery
he
had
just
finished
reading
the
second
novel
by
that
rondel
whose
violet
sensation
had
occurred
some
two
years
before
this
second
book
was
good
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
and
peter
was
ashamed
of
a
kind
of
dim
reluctance
in
his
acknowledgment
of
its
quality
the
fellow
had
had
such
reviews
the
book
although
less
sensational
than
its
predecessor
had
hit
the
public
straight
in
the
middle
of
its
susceptible
heart
had
young
rondel
done
it
all
with
bad
that
was
common
enough
but
the
book
was
good
uncommonly
good
he
sent
the
nurse
downstairs
and
began
to
build
an
elaborate
fortress
on
the
nursery
floor
the
baby
lay
on
his
back
on
a
rug
by
the
fire
and
contemplated
his
woollen
shoe
which
he
slowly
dragged
off
and
disdainfully
flung
away
then
crowing
to
himself
he
watched
his
father
and
the
world
in
general
he
was
amazingly
like
peter
the
grey
eyes
the
mouth
a
little
stern
a
little
sulky
the
snub
nose
the
arms
a
little
short
and
thick
and
that
confident
happy
smile
he
watched
his
father
to
him
lying
on
the
rug
many
many
miles
away
there
was
a
coloured
glory
that
ran
round
the
upper
part
of
the
wall
as
yet
he
only
knew
that
they
gave
him
those
colours
something
of
the
same
pleasure
that
his
milk
gave
him
that
the
warm
glowing
noisy
shapes
beyond
the
carpet
gave
him
that
the
happy
comfortable
smell
of
the
thing
playing
near
him
on
the
floor
gave
him
about
the
thing
he
was
eternally
perplexed
it
was
something
that
made
sounds
that
he
liked
that
pressed
his
body
in
a
way
that
he
loved
that
took
his
fingers
and
his
toes
and
made
them
warm
and
comfortable
it
was
something
moreover
from
which
delicious
things
hung
things
that
he
could
clutch
and
hold
and
pull
he
was
perplexed
but
he
knew
that
when
this
thing
was
near
him
he
was
warm
and
happy
and
contented
and
generally
went
to
sleep
his
eyes
slowly
travelled
round
the
room
and
rested
finally
upon
a
round
blue
ball
that
hung
turning
a
little
from
side
to
side
on
a
nail
above
his
bed
this
was
to
him
the
final
triumph
of
existence
to
have
it
in
his
hand
to
roll
it
round
and
round
to
bang
it
down
upon
the
floor
and
watch
it
jump
this
was
the
reason
why
one
was
here
this
the
solution
of
all
perplexities
he
would
have
liked
to
have
it
in
his
hands
now
so
crowing
he
smiled
pleasantly
at
the
thing
on
the
floor
beside
him
and
then
looked
at
the
ball
peter
got
up
from
his
knees
fetched
the
ball
down
and
rolled
it
along
the
floor
as
it
came
dancing
curving
laughing
along
young
stephen
shrieked
with
delight
would
he
have
it
in
his
hands
or
would
it
escape
him
and
disappear
altogether
would
it
come
to
him
it
came
and
was
clutched
and
held
and
triumphed
over
peter
sat
down
by
his
son
and
began
to
tell
him
about
cornwall
he
often
did
this
partly
because
the
mere
mentioning
of
names
and
places
satisfied
some
longing
in
his
heart
partly
because
he
wanted
cornwall
to
be
the
first
thing
that
young
stephen
would
realise
as
soon
as
he
realised
anything
and
you
never
can
tell
you
know
how
soon
a
child
can
begin
stephen
turning
the
blue
ball
round
and
round
in
his
fingers
gravely
listened
he
was
perfectly
contented
he
liked
the
sounds
that
circled
about
him
his
father
voice
the
rustle
of
the
fire
the
murmur
of
something
beyond
the
walls
that
he
could
not
understand
and
then
you
see
stephen
if
you
go
up
the
hill
and
round
to
the
right
you
come
to
the
all
covered
with
shiny
cobbles
and
once
a
week
filled
with
stalls
where
people
sell
things
at
the
other
end
of
it
facing
you
there
an
old
tower
that
been
there
for
ages
and
ages
it
got
a
fruit
stall
underneath
it
now
but
once
years
ago
there
was
fighting
there
and
men
were
killed
then
if
you
go
past
it
and
out
to
the
right
you
get
into
the
road
that
leads
out
of
the
town
it
goes
right
above
the
sea
and
on
a
peter
the
voice
broke
like
a
stone
shattering
a
sheet
of
glass
the
ball
dropped
from
young
stephen
hands
he
felt
suddenly
cold
and
hungry
and
wanted
his
woollen
shoe
he
was
not
sure
whether
he
would
not
cry
he
would
wait
a
moment
and
see
how
matters
developed
peter
jumped
to
his
feet
and
faced
clare
clare
in
a
fur
cap
from
beneath
which
her
golden
hair
seemed
to
burn
in
anger
from
beneath
which
her
eyes
furiously
attacked
his
of
course
she
had
heard
him
talking
to
the
baby
about
cornwall
they
had
quarrelled
about
it
before
he
had
thought
that
she
was
at
her
silly
his
face
that
had
been
a
few
moments
before
gentle
humorous
happy
now
suddenly
wore
the
sullen
defiance
of
a
sulky
boy
her
breast
was
heaving
her
little
hands
beat
against
her
frock
he
sha
she
broke
out
at
last
hear
about
of
all
the
nonsense
peter
answered
her
slowly
really
clare
sometimes
i
think
you
about
two
years
old
he
sha
hear
about
it
she
repeated
again
you
do
care
you
do
care
what
i
think
or
what
i
say
i
his
mother
i
have
the
right
the
baby
looked
at
them
both
with
wondering
eyes
and
to
any
outside
observer
would
surely
have
seemed
the
eldest
of
the
three
breath
came
in
little
pants
of
rage
you
know
that
i
hate
all
mention
of
that
place
those
people
it
does
matter
to
you
you
never
think
of
me
at
any
rate
he
retorted
if
you
were
up
here
in
the
nursery
more
often
you
would
be
able
to
take
care
that
stephen
innocent
ears
were
insulted
with
my
vulgar
conversation
it
was
then
that
he
saw
behind
clare
in
the
doorway
the
dark
smiling
face
of
cards
cards
came
forward
really
you
two
he
said
laughing
peter
old
man
do
be
absurd
you
too
clare
he
called
her
clare
now
the
anger
died
out
of
clare
eyes
well
he
knows
i
hate
him
talking
about
that
nasty
old
town
to
the
baby
then
in
a
moment
she
was
smiling
again
i
sorry
peter
cards
is
quite
right
and
anyhow
the
baby
does
understand
she
stood
smiling
in
front
of
him
but
the
frown
did
not
leave
his
face
oh
it
all
right
he
said
sullenly
and
he
brushed
past
them
up
the
stairs
to
his
own
room
iii
from
the
silence
of
his
room
he
thought
that
he
could
hear
them
laughing
about
it
downstairs
silly
old
peter
always
getting
into
tempers
well
was
he
and
after
all
had
it
been
this
time
her
affair
stephen
and
he
had
been
happy
enough
before
the
others
had
come
in
what
was
this
senseless
dislike
of
clare
to
cornwall
what
could
it
matter
to
her
it
was
always
cropping
up
now
he
could
think
of
a
thousand
occasions
lately
when
she
had
been
roused
by
it
but
as
he
paced
with
frowning
face
back
and
forwards
across
the
room
there
was
something
more
puzzling
still
that
had
to
be
thought
about
why
did
they
quarrel
about
such
tiny
things
in
novels
in
good
reliable
novels
it
was
always
the
big
things
about
which
people
fought
whoever
heard
of
two
people
quarrelling
because
one
of
them
wanted
to
talk
about
cornwall
and
yet
it
was
precisely
concerning
things
just
as
trivial
that
they
were
always
now
disputing
why
need
they
quarrel
at
all
in
the
first
year
there
had
always
been
peace
why
should
there
be
peace
now
where
exactly
lay
clare
altered
attitude
to
himself
to
his
opinions
to
the
world
in
general
if
he
yielded
to
her
demands
and
he
had
yielded
on
many
more
occasions
than
was
good
either
for
her
or
himself
she
had
he
fancied
laughed
at
him
for
being
so
easily
defeated
if
he
had
not
yielded
then
she
had
been
immediately
impossible
and
yet
after
their
quarrels
there
had
been
the
most
wonderful
precious
reconciliations
reconciliations
that
even
now
at
his
thought
of
them
made
his
heart
beat
faster
now
soon
when
he
went
downstairs
to
dress
for
dinner
she
would
come
to
him
he
knew
and
beg
most
beautifully
his
pardon
but
it
seemed
suddenly
that
this
kind
of
thing
had
happened
too
often
lately
he
felt
poor
peter
bewildered
there
seemed
to
be
on
every
side
of
him
so
many
things
that
he
was
called
upon
to
manage
and
he
was
so
unable
to
manage
any
of
them
he
stopped
in
his
treading
to
and
fro
and
stared
at
the
long
deal
at
which
he
always
worked
there
waiting
for
him
were
the
first
chapters
of
his
new
novel
mortimer
in
the
same
way
two
years
ago
he
had
stared
at
the
early
chapters
of
the
stone
house
on
that
morning
before
he
had
gone
to
propose
to
clare
now
there
flashed
through
his
mind
the
wonderful
things
that
he
intended
mortimer
stant
to
be
it
was
to
concern
a
man
of
forty
in
his
confident
selection
of
that
age
he
displayed
most
stridently
his
own
youth
and
mortimer
was
to
be
a
stolid
reserved
philistine
who
was
against
his
will
by
outside
forces
dragged
into
an
emotional
crisis
at
the
back
of
his
mind
he
had
perhaps
maradick
for
his
figure
but
that
was
almost
unconscious
mortimer
stant
was
to
represent
a
wonderful
duel
between
the
two
camps
the
artists
and
the
philistines
with
ultimate
victory
of
course
for
the
artists
it
was
to
be
well
what
was
it
to
be
at
present
the
stolid
mortimer
was
hidden
behind
a
phalanx
of
people
clare
young
stephen
cards
bobby
rossiter
tiresome
woman
alice
galleon
was
it
it
was
hidden
hidden
just
as
parts
of
the
stone
house
had
been
hidden
but
hidden
more
deeply
a
regular
jungle
of
interests
and
occupations
was
creeping
stealthily
stealthily
upon
him
and
then
his
eye
fell
upon
an
open
letter
that
lay
on
his
table
and
at
the
sight
of
it
he
was
seized
with
a
burning
sense
of
shame
how
could
he
have
forgotten
the
letter
ran
dear
westcott
you
have
not
been
to
see
me
for
many
months
further
opportunities
may
by
the
hand
of
god
be
denied
you
come
if
you
can
spare
the
time
henry
the
words
were
written
feebly
almost
illegibly
in
pencil
peter
knew
that
bobby
had
been
for
many
weeks
very
anxious
concerning
his
father
health
and
during
the
last
few
days
he
had
abandoned
the
city
and
spent
all
his
time
at
home
that
letter
had
come
this
very
morning
and
peter
had
intended
to
go
at
once
and
inquire
the
fact
that
he
had
left
all
these
months
without
going
to
see
the
old
man
rose
before
him
now
like
an
accusing
hand
he
deserved
indeed
whatever
the
gods
might
choose
to
send
him
if
he
could
so
wilfully
neglect
his
duty
but
he
knew
that
there
had
been
in
the
back
of
his
mind
shame
his
work
had
not
so
he
might
have
put
it
to
himself
been
good
enough
to
justify
his
presence
there
would
have
been
questions
asked
questions
that
he
might
have
found
it
difficult
indeed
to
answer
but
now
the
sight
of
that
letter
immediately
encouraged
him
henry
galleon
even
though
he
was
too
ill
to
talk
would
put
him
right
with
all
his
perplexities
would
give
him
courage
to
cut
through
all
these
complications
that
had
been
gathering
lately
so
thickly
about
him
this
the
room
seemed
to
whisper
to
him
is
your
chance
after
all
you
are
given
this
opportunity
see
him
once
before
he
dies
and
your
fate
will
be
shown
you
clearly
he
stepped
out
of
the
house
unperceived
and
was
immediately
conscious
of
the
spring
night
spring
with
a
precipitancy
and
extravagance
that
seems
to
be
to
own
peculiar
quality
in
london
had
leapt
upon
the
streets
the
embankment
was
bathed
in
the
evening
glow
clouds
like
bales
of
golden
wool
sailed
down
a
sky
so
faintly
blue
that
the
white
light
of
a
departed
sun
seemed
to
glow
behind
it
the
lamps
were
against
black
barges
that
might
have
been
loaded
with
yellow
primroses
so
did
they
hint
through
their
darkness
at
the
yellow
haze
around
them
the
silence
was
melodious
the
long
line
of
dark
houses
watched
like
prisoners
from
behind
their
iron
bars
they
might
expect
it
seemed
the
spring
to
burst
through
the
flagstones
at
their
feet
peter
heart
was
lightened
of
all
its
burden
he
shared
the
glory
the
intoxication
of
the
promise
that
was
on
every
side
of
him
on
such
a
night
great
ambitions
great
ideals
great
lovers
were
created
he
saw
henry
galleon
from
behind
his
window
watching
the
pageant
he
saw
him
gaining
new
life
getting
up
from
his
bed
of
sickness
writing
anew
his
great
masterpieces
and
he
saw
himself
peter
westcott
learning
at
last
from
the
master
the
rule
and
discipline
of
life
all
the
muddle
the
confusion
of
this
lazy
year
should
be
healed
he
and
clare
should
see
with
the
same
eyes
she
should
understand
his
need
for
work
he
should
understand
her
need
for
help
all
should
be
happiness
and
victory
in
this
glorious
world
and
he
by
the
master
side
should
he
stopped
suddenly
the
house
that
had
been
henry
galleon
was
blank
and
dead
at
every
window
the
blinds
were
down
chapter
ix
wild
men
i
to
peter
immediate
world
it
was
a
matter
of
surprise
that
he
should
take
henry
galleon
death
so
hardly
it
is
a
penalty
of
greatness
that
you
should
to
the
majority
of
your
fellow
men
be
an
idea
rather
than
a
human
being
to
his
own
family
henry
galleon
had
of
course
been
real
enough
but
to
the
outside
world
he
was
the
author
of
henry
lessingham
and
the
roads
whose
face
one
saw
in
the
papers
as
one
saw
the
face
of
royalty
peter
westcott
moreover
had
not
appeared
at
any
time
to
take
more
than
a
general
interest
in
the
great
man
and
it
was
even
understood
that
old
galleon
and
millicent
and
percival
considered
themselves
somewhat
affronted
because
the
master
had
been
exceedingly
kind
to
the
young
man
taken
trouble
about
him
tried
to
know
him
but
young
westcott
had
allowed
the
thing
to
drop
had
not
been
near
him
during
the
last
even
bobby
and
alice
galleon
were
astonished
at
peter
grief
to
bobby
his
father
death
came
as
a
fine
ending
to
a
fine
career
he
had
died
full
of
honour
and
of
years
even
bobby
who
thought
that
he
knew
his
peter
pretty
well
by
now
was
puzzled
he
takes
it
bobby
explained
to
alice
as
though
it
were
a
kind
of
omen
sees
ever
so
much
more
in
it
than
any
of
us
do
it
seems
that
he
was
coming
round
the
very
evening
that
father
died
to
talk
to
him
and
that
he
suddenly
saw
the
blinds
down
it
was
a
shock
to
him
of
course
i
think
it
all
been
a
kind
of
remorse
working
out
remorse
not
only
for
having
neglected
my
father
but
for
having
left
other
things
his
work
i
suppose
rather
to
look
after
themselves
but
he
wo
tell
me
bobby
almost
desperately
concluded
he
wo
tell
me
anything
he
really
is
the
most
extraordinary
and
peter
found
it
difficult
enough
to
tell
himself
did
not
indeed
try
he
only
knew
that
he
felt
an
acute
passionate
remorse
and
that
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
denial
of
that
last
visit
was
an
omen
of
the
anger
of
all
the
gods
and
even
although
to
this
last
he
gave
no
kind
of
expression
the
malicious
contrivance
of
an
old
man
who
waited
for
him
down
there
in
that
house
by
the
sea
it
was
as
though
gates
had
been
clanged
in
his
face
and
that
as
he
heard
them
close
he
heard
also
the
jeering
laughter
behind
them
he
had
missed
his
chance
he
saw
instantly
that
clare
understood
none
of
this
and
that
indeed
she
took
it
all
as
rather
an
affectation
on
his
part
something
in
him
that
belonged
to
that
side
of
him
that
she
tried
to
forget
she
hated
quite
frankly
that
he
should
go
about
the
house
with
a
glum
face
because
an
old
man
whom
he
had
never
taken
the
trouble
to
go
and
see
when
he
was
alive
was
now
dead
she
showed
him
that
she
hated
it
he
turned
desperately
to
his
work
there
had
been
a
hint
only
the
other
day
from
the
newspaper
for
which
he
wrote
that
his
reviews
had
not
lately
been
up
to
his
usual
standard
he
knew
that
they
seemed
to
him
twice
as
difficult
to
do
as
they
had
seemed
a
year
ago
and
that
therefore
he
did
them
twice
as
badly
he
flung
himself
upon
his
book
and
swore
that
he
would
dissipate
the
shadows
that
hid
it
from
him
one
of
the
shadows
he
saw
quite
clearly
was
cards
attitude
to
his
work
it
was
strange
he
thought
almost
pathetically
how
closely
his
feeling
for
cards
now
resembled
the
feeling
that
he
had
had
those
years
ago
at
dawson
he
still
worshipped
him
worship
was
the
only
possible
word
worshipped
him
for
all
the
things
that
he
peter
was
not
one
could
not
be
with
him
peter
thought
one
could
not
watch
his
movements
hear
his
voice
without
paying
it
all
the
most
absolute
reverence
the
glamour
about
cards
was
to
peter
something
almost
from
another
world
peter
felt
so
clumsy
so
rough
and
ugly
and
noisy
and
when
cards
was
present
that
the
fact
that
cards
was
almost
always
present
now
made
life
a
very
difficult
thing
how
could
peter
prevent
himself
from
reverencing
every
word
that
cards
uttered
when
one
reflected
upon
the
number
of
things
that
cards
had
done
the
things
that
he
had
seen
the
places
to
which
he
had
been
and
cards
attitude
to
peter
work
was
if
not
actually
contemptuous
at
least
something
very
like
it
he
did
not
he
professed
read
novels
the
novelists
trade
at
the
best
he
seemed
to
imply
was
only
a
poor
one
and
that
peter
work
was
not
altogether
of
the
best
he
almost
openly
asserted
what
can
old
peter
know
about
life
one
could
hear
him
saying
where
he
been
who
he
known
whatever
in
the
world
has
he
done
against
this
in
spite
of
the
glitter
that
shone
about
cards
head
peter
might
perhaps
have
stood
he
reminded
himself
a
hundred
times
a
day
that
one
must
not
care
about
the
things
that
other
people
said
one
must
have
one
eyes
fixed
upon
the
goal
one
must
be
sure
of
oneself
what
had
galleon
said
but
there
was
also
the
effect
of
it
all
upon
clare
to
be
considered
clare
listened
to
cards
she
was
peter
gloomily
considered
very
largely
of
cards
opinion
the
two
people
for
whom
he
cared
most
in
the
world
after
young
stephen
who
as
a
critic
had
not
yet
begun
to
count
thought
that
he
was
wasting
his
time
sometimes
as
he
sat
at
his
deal
table
fighting
with
a
growing
sense
of
disillusionment
that
was
like
nothing
so
much
as
a
child
first
discovery
that
its
beautiful
doll
is
stuffed
with
straw
he
would
wish
passionately
vehemently
for
the
return
of
those
days
when
he
had
sat
in
his
little
bedroom
writing
reuben
hallard
with
norah
monogue
and
dear
zanti
and
even
taciturn
little
gottfried
there
to
encourage
him
had
been
adventure
but
this
and
then
he
would
remember
young
stephen
and
clare
moments
even
lately
that
she
had
shared
with
him
and
he
would
be
ashamed
ii
it
was
on
an
afternoon
of
furious
wind
and
rain
in
early
april
that
the
inevitable
occurred
all
the
afternoon
the
trees
in
the
little
orchard
had
been
knocking
their
branches
together
as
though
they
were
in
a
furious
temper
with
somebody
and
were
indignant
at
not
being
allowed
to
get
at
him
they
gave
you
the
impression
that
it
would
be
quite
as
much
as
your
life
would
be
worth
to
venture
into
their
midst
peter
had
during
a
number
of
hours
endeavoured
to
pierce
the
soul
of
mortimer
stant
meanwhile
as
the
wind
howled
the
rain
lashed
the
windows
of
his
room
and
the
personality
of
stant
faded
farther
and
farther
away
into
ultimate
distance
peter
was
increasingly
conscious
that
he
was
listening
for
something
he
had
felt
himself
surrounded
by
this
strange
sense
of
anticipation
before
sometimes
it
had
stayed
with
him
for
a
short
period
only
sometimes
it
had
extended
over
days
always
it
brought
with
it
an
emotion
of
excitement
and
even
if
he
had
analysed
it
sufficiently
fear
he
was
suddenly
conscious
in
the
naked
spaces
of
his
room
of
the
personality
of
his
father
so
conscious
was
he
that
he
got
up
from
his
table
and
stood
at
the
window
looking
out
into
the
orchard
as
though
he
expected
to
see
a
sinister
figure
creeping
stealthily
from
behind
the
trees
in
his
thoughts
of
his
father
there
was
no
compunction
no
accusing
scruples
of
neglect
only
a
perfectly
concrete
active
sense
in
some
vague
way
of
force
pitted
against
force
it
might
be
summed
up
in
the
conviction
that
the
old
man
was
not
done
with
him
yet
and
as
peter
turned
back
from
the
window
almost
relieved
that
he
had
indeed
seen
no
creeping
figure
amongst
the
dark
trees
he
was
aware
that
never
since
the
days
of
his
starvation
in
bucket
lane
had
he
been
so
conscious
of
those
threatening
memories
of
scaw
house
and
its
inhabitants
at
that
almost
as
he
reached
his
table
there
was
a
knock
on
his
door
come
in
he
cried
and
scorning
himself
for
his
fears
faced
the
maid
with
staring
eyes
two
gentlemen
to
see
you
sir
she
said
i
have
shown
them
into
the
is
westcott
in
no
sir
she
told
me
that
she
would
not
be
back
until
six
i
will
come
in
the
hall
hanging
amongst
the
other
things
as
a
pirate
might
hang
beside
a
company
of
evangelist
ministers
was
stephen
brant
hat
as
peter
hand
turned
on
the
handle
of
the
study
door
he
knew
that
his
heart
was
beating
with
so
furious
a
clamour
that
he
could
not
hear
the
lock
turn
iii
he
entered
the
room
and
found
stephen
brant
and
zanti
facing
him
the
little
window
between
the
dim
rows
of
books
showed
him
the
pale
light
that
was
soon
to
succeed
the
storm
the
two
men
seemed
to
fill
the
little
room
their
bodies
were
shadowy
and
mysterious
against
the
pale
colour
and
peter
had
the
impression
that
the
things
in
the
room
the
chairs
the
books
the
table
huddled
against
the
wall
so
crowded
did
the
place
seem
for
himself
at
his
first
sight
of
them
he
was
compelled
instantly
to
check
a
feeling
of
joy
so
overwhelming
that
he
was
himself
astonished
at
the
force
of
it
to
them
as
they
stood
there
smiling
feeling
that
same
emotion
to
which
he
also
was
now
succumbing
he
checked
himself
it
was
as
though
he
were
forced
suddenly
by
a
supreme
effort
of
will
to
drive
from
the
room
a
tumultuous
crowd
of
pictures
enthusiasms
and
memories
that
for
the
sake
of
the
present
and
of
the
future
must
be
forbidden
to
stay
with
him
it
was
absurd
he
was
a
husband
a
father
a
responsible
householder
almost
a
personage
and
yet
as
he
looked
at
stephen
eyes
and
zanti
smile
he
was
the
little
boy
back
again
in
tan
shop
with
the
old
suit
of
armour
the
beads
and
silver
and
eastern
cloths
and
out
beyond
the
window
the
sea
was
breaking
upon
the
wooden
jetty
he
put
the
picture
away
from
him
and
rushed
to
greet
the
two
of
them
zanti
stephen
oh
how
splendid
how
perfectly
perfectly
splendid
zanti
enormous
body
was
enclosed
in
a
suit
of
bright
blue
his
broad
nose
stood
out
like
a
bridge
his
wide
mouth
gaped
he
wore
white
spats
three
massive
rings
of
twisted
gold
and
in
his
blue
tie
a
glittering
emerald
he
was
a
magnificent
a
costly
figure
and
in
nothing
was
the
geniality
of
his
nature
more
plainly
seen
than
in
his
obvious
readiness
to
abandon
at
any
moment
these
splendid
riches
for
the
sake
of
a
valued
attachment
i
love
wearing
these
things
you
might
hear
him
say
but
i
love
still
better
to
do
anything
in
the
world
that
i
can
for
you
my
stephen
presented
a
more
moderate
appearance
but
he
was
brown
with
health
and
shining
with
strength
he
was
like
the
old
stephen
of
years
and
years
ago
so
different
from
the
man
who
had
shared
with
peter
that
room
in
bucket
lane
he
carried
himself
with
that
air
of
strong
cautious
reserve
that
cornishmen
have
when
they
are
in
some
other
country
than
their
own
his
eyes
mild
gentle
but
on
the
alert
ready
at
an
instant
to
be
hostile
then
when
peter
came
in
the
reserve
instantly
fled
they
had
all
three
of
them
perhaps
expected
embarrassment
but
at
that
cry
of
peter
they
were
suddenly
together
zanti
waving
his
hands
almost
shouting
stephen
his
eyes
resting
with
delight
on
peter
peter
himself
another
creature
from
the
man
who
had
pursued
mortimer
stant
in
the
room
upstairs
half
an
hour
before
we
thought
that
ze
time
come
dear
boy
we
know
zat
you
are
zanti
looked
about
him
a
little
anxiously
as
though
he
expected
to
find
peter
hiding
under
a
chair
or
a
sofa
oh
stephen
after
all
this
long
long
while
why
did
you
come
before
when
zanti
came
too
many
of
us
coming
peter
and
you
so
nonsense
i
not
in
the
least
busy
i
sorry
to
say
my
wife
out
but
the
baby
in
upstairs
and
there
the
most
terrific
woman
up
there
too
the
nurse
i
frightened
out
of
my
life
of
her
but
we
get
rid
of
her
and
have
the
place
to
ourselves
you
know
the
kid
called
after
you
stephen
no
is
he
really
stephen
face
shone
with
pleasure
i
keen
to
see
oh
he
a
trump
there
never
really
was
such
a
and
your
books
peter
oh
the
books
peter
voice
dropped
never
mind
them
now
but
what
have
you
been
doing
you
two
made
heaps
of
money
discovered
treasure
he
pulled
himself
up
shortly
he
remembered
the
bookshop
the
girl
leaning
against
the
door
looking
into
the
street
then
the
boys
crying
the
news
if
zanti
had
been
mixing
himself
up
with
that
sort
of
thing
again
and
then
the
bright
blue
suit
the
white
spats
were
reassuring
as
if
one
could
ever
take
such
a
child
seriously
about
anything
zanti
shook
his
head
ruefully
no
not
ezackly
a
fortune
there
was
a
place
i
of
right
up
in
the
basque
country
was
an
old
deserted
garden
where
zey
buried
treasure
centuries
ago
i
it
quite
certainly
from
a
friend
we
came
up
there
for
a
time
but
we
found
he
sighed
and
then
was
instantly
cheered
again
but
all
right
i
got
a
plan
now
a
wonderful
he
became
very
mysterious
it
a
certain
thing
we
off
to
cornwall
brant
and
myself
cornwall
come
too
ah
do
i
wish
that
i
could
he
suddenly
saw
his
life
his
books
everything
in
london
holding
him
tying
him
but
i
ca
go
now
my
father
being
there
makes
it
impossible
but
in
any
case
i
a
family
man
now
you
as
he
said
the
words
he
was
conscious
that
in
stephen
eyes
at
any
rate
the
family
man
was
about
the
last
thing
that
he
looked
he
was
wondering
with
intense
curiosity
what
were
the
things
that
stephen
was
finding
in
him
for
the
things
that
stephen
found
were
most
assuredly
the
things
that
he
was
no
one
knew
him
as
stephen
knew
him
against
his
will
the
thought
of
clare
came
driving
upon
him
how
little
she
knew
him
or
was
it
only
that
she
knew
another
side
of
him
but
he
pulled
himself
away
from
that
now
for
the
nursery
stephen
secundus
but
you
have
to
support
me
whilst
i
get
rid
of
kant
perhaps
three
of
us
together
as
he
led
the
way
upstairs
he
knew
that
stephen
was
not
entirely
reassured
about
him
kant
was
a
large
busy
woman
like
a
horse
a
horse
who
dislikes
other
horses
and
sniffs
an
enemy
in
every
wind
she
very
decidedly
sniffed
an
enemy
now
and
zanti
blue
suit
paled
before
her
fierce
eyes
he
stepped
back
into
the
doorway
again
treading
upon
stephen
peter
who
was
always
conscious
that
kant
looked
upon
himself
and
clare
as
two
entirely
ridiculous
and
slightly
impertinent
children
stammered
a
little
you
might
go
down
and
have
your
tea
now
kant
i
keep
an
eye
upon
i
had
my
tea
thank
you
well
i
relieve
you
of
the
baby
for
a
she
was
sewing
she
snapped
off
a
piece
of
thread
with
a
sharp
click
of
her
teeth
sat
silently
for
a
moment
staring
in
front
of
her
then
quietly
got
up
thank
you
sir
she
said
and
left
the
room
all
three
men
breathed
again
as
the
door
closed
then
they
were
all
conscious
of
young
stephen
the
thing
was
of
course
absurd
but
to
all
three
of
them
there
came
the
conviction
that
the
baby
had
been
laughing
at
them
for
their
terror
of
kant
he
was
curled
up
on
a
chair
by
the
fire
looking
at
them
with
his
wide
eyes
over
his
shoulder
and
he
seemed
to
say
i
care
a
snap
for
the
woman
why
should
you
the
blue
ball
was
on
the
floor
at
the
foot
of
the
chair
and
the
firelight
leapt
upon
the
frieze
that
peter
had
so
carefully
chosen
giants
and
castles
dwarfs
and
princesses
running
round
the
room
in
red
and
blue
and
gold
young
stephen
looked
at
them
puzzled
for
an
instant
then
with
a
shout
he
would
have
acclaimed
his
father
but
his
gaze
was
suddenly
arrested
by
the
intense
blueness
of
zanti
clothes
he
stared
at
it
fascinated
into
his
life
there
had
suddenly
broken
the
revelation
that
you
might
have
something
far
larger
than
the
blue
ball
that
moved
and
shone
in
so
fascinating
a
manner
his
eyes
immediately
glittered
with
the
thought
that
he
would
presently
have
the
joy
of
rolling
something
so
big
and
shining
along
the
floor
he
could
not
bear
to
wait
his
fat
fingers
curved
in
the
air
with
the
eager
anticipation
of
it
words
actual
words
had
not
as
yet
come
to
him
but
crowing
and
gurgling
he
informed
the
world
that
he
wanted
he
demanded
instantly
that
he
should
roll
zanti
well
old
man
how
are
you
said
peter
but
he
would
not
look
at
his
father
his
arms
stretched
toward
zanti
you
made
a
conquest
right
away
zanti
peter
said
laughing
it
was
indeed
instantly
to
be
perceived
that
zanti
was
in
his
right
element
any
pretence
of
any
kind
of
age
fell
away
from
him
his
arms
curved
towards
young
stephen
as
young
stephen
curved
towards
him
he
was
making
noises
in
his
throat
that
exactly
resembled
the
noises
that
the
baby
made
he
looked
down
gravely
upon
the
chair
do
you
do
he
said
and
he
took
young
stephen
fat
fingers
in
his
hand
says
he
remarked
looking
at
peter
and
stephen
that
would
like
to
roll
me
upon
the
floor
like
that
ball
there
well
let
him
said
peter
laughing
the
baby
then
dug
his
fingers
into
zanti
hair
and
pulled
down
his
head
towards
the
chair
intense
satisfaction
flooding
his
face
as
he
did
so
the
baby
seemed
for
a
moment
to
whisper
into
zanti
ear
then
chuckling
it
climbed
down
from
the
chair
and
on
all
fours
crawled
its
eyes
and
mouth
suddenly
serious
as
though
it
were
conscious
that
it
was
engaged
upon
a
very
desperate
adventure
the
three
men
watched
it
across
the
absolute
silence
of
the
room
there
came
the
sound
of
the
rain
driving
upon
the
pane
of
the
tumbling
chatter
of
the
fire
of
the
baby
hands
falling
upon
the
carpet
zanti
was
suddenly
upon
his
knees
here
he
cried
seizing
the
blue
ball
he
rolled
it
to
young
stephen
it
was
caught
dropped
and
then
the
fat
fingers
had
flung
themselves
upon
zanti
coat
he
let
himself
go
and
was
pulled
back
sprawling
upon
the
floor
his
huge
body
stretching
from
end
to
end
of
the
rug
then
almost
before
they
had
realised
it
the
other
two
men
were
down
upon
their
knees
the
ball
was
picked
up
and
tossed
from
hand
to
hand
the
baby
sitting
upon
zanti
stomach
watched
with
delight
these
extraordinary
events
then
they
played
hunt
the
slipper
sitting
round
in
a
ring
upon
the
carpet
young
stephen
trying
to
catch
his
own
slipper
falling
over
upon
his
back
kicking
his
legs
in
the
air
dashing
now
at
stephen
the
elder
beard
now
at
his
father
coat
now
at
zanti
legs
the
noise
of
the
laughter
drowned
the
rain
and
the
fire
zanti
had
the
slipper
he
was
sitting
upon
it
peter
made
a
dash
for
it
zanti
rolled
over
they
were
all
in
a
heap
upon
the
floor
i
got
zanti
was
off
on
all
fours
round
the
room
the
baby
on
his
back
clutching
on
to
his
hair
a
chair
was
over
then
a
box
of
bricks
the
table
rocked
and
then
was
suddenly
down
with
a
crash
what
had
come
to
them
all
stephen
so
grave
so
solemn
had
caught
the
baby
into
the
air
had
flung
him
up
and
caught
him
again
peter
and
zanti
looking
up
from
the
floor
saw
him
standing
his
legs
wide
his
beard
flowing
his
arms
stretched
with
young
stephen
shouting
between
them
behind
him
around
him
was
a
wrecked
nursery
the
baby
surveying
the
world
from
this
sudden
height
wondered
at
this
amazing
glory
he
had
never
before
beheld
from
such
a
position
the
things
that
bounded
his
life
how
strange
the
window
seemed
through
it
now
he
could
see
the
tops
of
the
trees
the
grey
sky
the
driving
lines
of
rain
only
a
little
way
above
him
now
were
pictures
that
had
always
glowed
before
from
so
great
a
distance
around
him
above
him
below
him
space
a
thing
to
be
frightened
of
were
one
not
held
so
tightly
so
safely
he
approved
most
assuredly
of
the
banishment
of
kant
and
the
invasion
of
these
splendid
things
he
would
have
life
always
like
this
with
that
great
blue
ball
to
roll
upon
the
floor
with
that
brown
beard
near
now
to
his
hand
to
clutch
with
none
of
that
hideous
philosophy
that
he
was
becoming
now
conscious
enough
to
rebel
against
he
dug
his
hands
into
the
beard
that
was
close
to
him
and
like
the
sons
of
the
morning
shouted
with
joy
peter
looking
up
at
the
two
stephens
felt
his
burdens
roll
off
his
back
if
only
things
could
be
like
this
always
and
already
he
saw
himself
through
these
two
making
everything
right
once
more
with
clare
they
should
prove
to
her
that
after
all
his
past
life
had
not
been
so
terrible
that
cornwall
could
produce
heroes
if
it
liked
through
these
two
he
would
get
fresh
inspiration
for
his
work
he
felt
already
through
them
a
wind
blowing
that
cleared
all
the
dust
from
his
brain
and
how
splendid
for
the
boy
to
have
two
such
men
for
his
friends
already
he
was
planning
to
persuade
them
to
stay
in
london
he
had
thought
of
the
very
place
for
them
in
chelsea
near
the
roundabout
the
very
house
of
course
you
stay
for
dinner
you
two
but
said
zanti
mopping
his
brow
from
which
perspiration
was
dripping
no
nonsense
of
course
you
stop
we
got
such
heaps
to
talk
about
stephen
had
got
the
baby
now
on
his
shoulder
off
to
cornwall
he
shouted
and
charged
down
the
room
it
was
at
that
instant
that
peter
was
conscious
that
clare
had
been
standing
for
some
moments
in
the
room
she
stood
quite
silently
without
moving
by
the
door
her
eyes
blazing
at
him
his
first
thought
was
of
that
other
time
when
she
had
found
him
in
the
nursery
of
the
quarrel
that
they
had
had
then
he
noticed
the
state
of
the
room
the
overturned
chairs
and
table
then
he
saw
zanti
still
wiping
his
forehead
but
confusedly
and
staring
at
clare
in
a
shocked
hushed
way
as
though
he
were
a
small
boy
who
had
been
detected
with
his
fingers
in
a
stephen
saw
her
at
last
he
put
the
baby
down
and
came
slowly
across
the
floor
peter
spoke
why
clare
you
back
early
we
been
having
such
a
splendid
time
with
stephen
let
me
introduce
my
friends
to
you
zanti
and
brant
you
heard
me
speak
of
them
they
came
towards
her
she
shook
hands
with
them
regarding
them
gravely
how
do
you
do
there
was
silence
then
zanti
said
we
must
be
goin
longer
than
we
ought
to
stop
we
business
peter
felt
rising
in
him
a
cold
and
surging
anger
at
her
treatment
of
them
these
two
the
best
friends
that
he
had
in
the
world
that
she
should
dare
oh
you
stay
to
dinner
you
two
you
must
i
afraid
ver
afraid
zanti
said
bowing
very
low
and
still
looking
at
clare
with
apologetic
troubled
eyes
we
no
time
immediate
still
clare
said
nothing
there
was
another
moment
silence
and
then
peter
said
i
come
down
and
see
you
still
without
moving
from
her
place
she
shook
hands
with
them
they
all
three
went
out
peter
could
say
nothing
the
words
seemed
to
be
choked
in
his
throat
by
this
tide
of
anger
that
was
like
nothing
he
had
ever
felt
before
he
held
their
hands
for
a
moment
as
they
stood
outside
in
the
dusk
where
are
you
staying
i
must
see
you
again
we
go
down
to
cornwall
stephen
caught
peter
shoulder
come
down
to
us
peter
if
you
get
a
they
all
stared
at
one
another
they
were
all
absolutely
entirely
without
words
afterwards
they
would
regret
that
they
had
said
nothing
but
now
they
vanished
into
the
dusk
and
peter
stepping
into
the
house
again
closed
very
softly
the
hall
door
behind
him
chapter
x
rocking
the
roundabout
i
as
he
climbed
once
more
the
stairs
to
the
nursery
he
was
conscious
of
the
necessity
for
a
great
restraint
did
he
but
relax
for
an
instant
his
control
he
was
aware
that
forces
often
dimly
perceived
and
shuddered
at
would
now
as
never
in
his
life
before
burst
into
freedom
it
was
as
though
a
whole
life
of
joy
and
happiness
had
been
suddenly
snatched
from
him
and
it
was
clare
who
had
robbed
him
clare
who
had
never
cared
what
the
things
might
be
that
she
demanded
from
him
clare
who
gave
him
nothing
but
his
rage
now
he
also
felt
was
beyond
all
reason
something
that
belonged
to
that
other
part
of
him
the
part
that
scaw
house
and
its
dark
room
understood
and
so
terribly
fostered
he
was
afraid
of
what
he
might
do
ii
on
opening
the
nursery
door
he
saw
the
straight
thin
shining
back
of
kant
as
she
bent
to
put
things
straight
young
stephen
was
quietly
asleep
he
closed
the
door
and
turning
in
the
narrow
passage
found
clare
coming
out
of
her
room
in
the
dim
light
they
faced
one
another
hostility
flaming
between
them
she
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
her
breast
heaving
her
mouth
so
tight
and
sharp
her
eyes
so
fierce
that
her
little
stature
seemed
to
be
raised
by
her
anger
to
a
great
height
at
that
moment
peter
felt
that
he
hated
her
as
he
had
never
hated
any
one
in
his
life
before
she
went
back
without
a
word
into
her
room
she
did
not
come
down
again
that
night
and
he
had
his
evening
meal
miserably
alone
he
slept
in
his
long
before
morning
his
rage
had
gone
he
looked
at
her
locked
door
and
wished
miserably
that
he
might
die
for
her
iii
later
as
he
sat
hopelessly
over
the
dim
and
sterile
pages
of
mortimer
slant
rossiter
came
heavily
in
to
talk
with
him
rossiter
always
entered
the
room
with
an
expression
of
stupid
benignity
that
hid
a
good
deal
of
rather
sharp
perception
the
fact
that
she
was
not
nearly
so
stupid
as
she
looked
enabled
her
to
look
all
the
stupider
and
she
covered
a
multitude
of
brains
with
a
quantity
of
hard
black
silk
that
she
spread
out
around
her
with
the
air
of
one
who
is
filling
as
much
of
the
room
as
she
can
conveniently
seize
upon
her
plump
arms
her
broad
and
placid
bosom
her
flat
smooth
face
her
hair
entirely
negative
in
colour
and
arrangement
offered
no
clue
whatever
to
her
unsuspected
sharpnesses
smooth
broad
flat
and
motionless
she
carried
like
the
wooden
horse
of
troy
a
thousand
dangers
in
the
depths
of
her
placidity
she
had
come
now
to
assist
her
daughter
the
only
person
for
whom
she
may
be
said
to
have
had
the
slightest
genuine
affection
for
rossiter
she
had
and
galleon
was
an
ally
and
companion
but
never
a
friend
she
had
allowed
clare
to
marry
peter
chiefly
because
clare
would
have
married
him
in
any
case
but
also
a
little
because
she
thought
that
peter
had
a
great
career
in
front
of
him
now
that
peter
career
seemed
already
to
be
for
the
most
part
behind
him
she
disliked
him
and
because
he
appeared
to
have
made
clare
unhappy
suddenly
hated
him
but
placidity
was
the
shield
that
covered
her
attack
and
for
a
symbol
one
might
take
the
large
flat
golden
brooch
that
she
wore
on
her
bosom
flat
expressionless
and
shining
with
the
sharpest
pin
behind
it
that
ever
brooch
possessed
peter
whose
miseries
had
accumulated
as
the
minutes
passed
was
ready
to
seize
upon
anything
that
promised
a
reconciliation
he
did
not
like
rossiter
he
had
never
been
able
to
get
to
close
quarters
with
her
and
he
was
conscious
that
his
roughness
and
occasional
outbursts
displeased
her
he
felt
too
that
the
qualities
that
he
had
resented
in
clare
owed
their
origin
to
her
mother
that
brooch
of
hers
was
responsible
for
a
great
deal
fixing
his
eyes
upon
it
he
said
you
come
about
clare
yes
rossiter
settled
herself
more
comfortably
spread
her
skirts
folded
her
hands
she
very
the
mild
eyes
baffled
him
i
terribly
sorry
i
will
do
anything
i
can
but
i
think
that
i
had
a
right
he
faltered
a
little
it
was
so
like
talking
to
an
empty
dairy
had
a
right
to
mind
two
old
friends
of
mine
two
of
the
best
friends
that
i
have
in
the
world
were
here
yesterday
and
clare
i
do
think
the
soft
voice
broke
in
upon
him
whilst
the
eyes
searched
his
body
up
and
down
that
even
now
peter
you
quite
understand
clare
no
he
said
eagerly
i
know
i
blundering
stupid
lots
of
times
i
irritated
her
and
now
he
paused
but
then
added
with
a
touch
of
his
old
stubbornness
but
they
were
friends
of
mine
she
should
have
treated
them
rossiter
felt
that
she
did
indeed
hate
the
young
man
clare
is
very
unhappy
she
repeated
she
tells
me
that
she
has
been
crying
all
night
you
must
remember
peter
that
her
life
has
been
very
different
to
yours
he
wished
that
she
would
not
repeat
herself
he
wished
that
she
would
not
always
use
the
same
level
voice
he
wanted
insanely
to
tell
her
that
she
ought
to
say
different
from
he
could
not
take
his
eyes
from
the
brooch
but
the
thought
of
clare
came
to
him
and
he
bowed
himself
once
more
humbly
i
will
see
that
things
are
better
he
said
earnestly
i
do
know
what
has
been
the
matter
lately
my
work
and
everything
has
been
wrong
and
i
expect
my
temper
has
been
horrible
you
know
he
said
with
a
little
crooked
smile
that
i
got
to
work
to
keep
it
all
going
and
when
i
writing
badly
then
my
temper
goes
to
rossiter
with
no
appearance
of
having
heard
anything
that
he
had
said
continued
you
know
peter
that
your
temperament
is
very
different
to
clare
you
are
and
i
know
you
will
forgive
my
putting
it
so
plainly
a
little
wild
still
doubtless
owing
to
your
earlier
years
clare
is
gentle
bright
happy
she
has
never
given
my
husband
or
myself
a
trouble
but
that
is
because
we
understood
her
nature
we
knew
that
she
loved
people
about
her
to
be
happy
she
flourished
in
the
sun
she
drooped
under
the
clouds
under
the
clouds
rossiter
repeated
again
softly
as
she
searched
with
care
for
her
next
words
irritation
was
rising
within
peter
why
should
it
be
concluded
so
inevitably
that
the
fault
was
all
on
peter
side
and
not
at
all
on
clare
after
all
there
were
reasons
but
he
pulled
himself
up
he
had
behaved
like
a
beast
i
tried
very
hard
he
began
clouds
said
rossiter
and
you
peter
are
at
times
i
have
seen
it
myself
and
i
know
that
it
is
apparent
to
others
inclined
to
be
morose
gloomy
a
little
gloomy
her
fingers
tapped
the
silk
of
her
dress
dear
clare
considering
what
her
own
life
has
been
shrinks
i
must
confess
it
seems
to
me
quite
naturally
from
any
reminder
of
what
your
own
earlier
circumstances
have
been
look
at
it
peter
for
an
instant
from
the
outside
and
you
will
see
at
once
i
am
sure
what
it
must
have
been
to
her
yesterday
to
come
into
her
nursery
to
find
tables
chairs
overturned
strange
men
shouting
and
flinging
poor
little
stephen
towards
the
ceiling
some
talk
about
cornwall
really
peter
i
think
you
can
understand
he
abandoned
all
his
defences
i
know
i
ought
to
have
realised
it
was
quite
natural
in
the
back
of
his
head
he
heard
her
words
you
morose
you
wild
other
people
find
you
so
you
making
a
mess
of
everything
and
every
one
knows
it
he
was
humbled
to
the
dust
if
only
he
might
make
it
all
right
with
clare
then
he
would
see
to
it
oh
yes
he
would
see
to
it
that
nothing
of
this
kind
ever
happened
again
from
rossiter
standpoint
he
looked
back
upon
his
life
and
found
it
all
one
ignoble
selfish
muddle
dear
clare
so
eager
to
be
happy
and
he
had
made
her
miserable
will
she
forgive
me
dear
clare
said
rossiter
rising
brightly
and
with
a
general
air
of
benevolence
towards
all
the
sinners
in
existence
is
the
most
forgiving
creature
in
the
he
went
down
to
her
bedroom
and
found
her
lying
on
a
sofa
and
reading
a
novel
he
fell
on
his
knees
at
her
side
clare
darling
i
a
beast
a
brute
she
suddenly
turned
her
face
into
the
cushions
and
burst
into
passionate
crying
oh
it
horrible
horrible
horrible
he
kissed
her
hand
and
then
getting
on
to
his
feet
again
stood
looking
at
her
awkwardly
struggling
for
words
with
which
to
comfort
her
iv
and
then
at
luncheon
there
was
a
little
pencilled
feeble
note
for
peter
from
norah
monogue
please
if
you
can
spare
half
an
hour
come
to
me
in
a
day
or
two
i
am
off
to
the
things
had
just
been
restored
to
peace
and
happiness
clare
had
just
proposed
that
they
should
go
that
afternoon
to
a
private
view
together
they
might
go
and
have
tea
with
for
an
instant
he
was
tempted
to
abandon
norah
then
his
courage
came
here
a
note
from
miss
monogue
he
said
she
awfully
ill
i
think
i
ought
clare
face
hardened
again
she
got
up
from
the
table
just
as
you
please
she
said
he
climbed
on
to
the
omnibus
that
was
to
stumble
with
him
down
piccadilly
with
hideous
numbing
sense
of
being
under
the
hand
of
fate
why
at
this
moment
in
all
time
should
this
letter
of
norah
monogue
have
made
its
unhappy
appearance
with
what
difficulty
and
sorrow
had
he
and
clare
reached
once
more
a
reconciliation
only
so
wantonly
to
be
plucked
away
from
it
again
from
the
top
of
his
omnibus
he
looked
down
upon
a
sinister
london
it
was
a
heavy
lowering
day
thick
clouds
like
damp
cloths
came
down
upon
the
towers
and
chimneys
the
trees
in
the
green
park
were
black
and
chill
and
in
and
out
of
the
clubs
figures
slipped
cautiously
and
it
seemed
furtively
just
beyond
the
green
park
they
were
building
a
vast
hotel
climbing
figures
and
twisting
lines
of
scaffolding
pierced
the
air
and
behind
the
rolling
and
rattling
of
the
traffic
the
sound
of
many
hammers
beat
rhythmically
monotonously
to
peter
upon
his
omnibus
suddenly
that
sound
that
he
had
heard
before
that
sound
of
london
stirring
came
back
to
him
and
now
more
clearly
than
he
had
ever
known
it
whir
whir
it
seemed
to
him
that
all
the
cabs
and
the
buses
and
the
little
black
figures
were
being
hurried
by
some
power
straight
fast
along
piccadilly
to
be
pitched
at
the
end
of
it
into
some
dark
abysmal
pit
there
to
perish
miserably
yes
the
beast
was
stirring
ever
so
little
the
pavements
the
houses
were
heaving
perhaps
if
one
could
see
already
the
soil
was
cracking
beneath
one
feet
look
out
london
will
have
you
in
a
anyhow
it
was
a
heavy
clammy
day
the
houses
were
ghosts
and
the
people
were
ghosts
and
grey
shadows
soon
perhaps
to
be
a
yellow
fog
floated
about
the
windows
and
the
doors
and
muffled
all
human
sounds
he
passed
the
great
pile
of
scaffolding
saw
iron
girders
shining
saw
huge
cranes
swinging
in
saw
tiny
tiny
black
atoms
perched
above
the
noise
and
swallowed
by
the
smoke
yes
the
beast
was
moving
and
out
and
in
lost
and
then
found
again
crept
that
twisting
chain
of
beggars
to
whose
pallid
army
peter
himself
had
once
so
nearly
belonged
i
suppose
i
got
a
headache
after
all
that
row
with
clare
peter
thought
as
he
climbed
off
the
omnibus
v
he
realised
as
he
came
into
the
bloomsbury
square
and
saw
brockett
gloomily
waiting
for
him
that
the
adventures
of
his
life
were
most
strangely
bound
together
not
for
an
instant
did
he
seem
to
be
able
to
escape
from
any
one
of
them
now
it
would
be
cornwall
now
the
bookshop
now
stephen
now
zanti
now
bucket
lane
now
treliss
all
of
them
interweaving
arresting
his
action
at
every
moment
because
he
had
done
that
once
now
this
must
not
be
permitted
him
he
felt
as
he
rang
the
old
heavy
bell
of
brockett
that
his
head
would
never
think
clearly
again
as
the
door
opened
and
he
stepped
into
the
hall
he
heard
faintly
across
the
flat
spaces
of
the
square
even
brockett
who
might
be
considered
if
any
one
in
the
world
immune
from
morbid
imaginations
felt
the
heaviness
of
the
day
suggested
a
prevalence
of
thunder
and
shook
her
head
when
peter
asked
about
miss
monogue
she
bad
peter
very
bad
poor
dear
there
no
doubt
about
that
it
hard
to
see
what
can
be
done
for
her
but
plucky
that
a
small
word
for
it
i
sure
she
is
said
peter
feeling
ashamed
of
having
made
so
much
of
his
own
little
troubles
she
must
get
out
of
london
if
she
to
improve
at
all
in
a
week
or
two
i
hope
she
be
able
to
how
every
one
else
oh
well
brockett
straightened
her
dress
with
her
beautiful
hands
in
the
old
familiar
way
but
you
not
looking
very
hearty
yourself
oh
i
all
right
he
answered
smiling
but
she
shook
her
head
after
him
as
she
watched
him
go
up
the
stairs
and
then
he
was
surprised
he
came
into
norah
monogue
room
and
found
her
sitting
up
by
her
window
looking
better
than
he
had
ever
seen
her
her
face
was
full
of
colour
and
her
eyes
bright
and
smiling
only
on
her
hands
the
blue
veins
stood
out
and
their
touch
when
she
shook
hands
with
him
was
hot
and
burning
but
he
was
reassured
brockett
had
exaggerated
and
made
the
worst
of
it
all
you
looking
splendid
i
so
glad
i
was
afraid
from
your
oh
i
really
am
getting
on
she
broke
in
gaily
and
it
the
nicest
boy
in
the
world
that
you
are
to
come
in
and
see
me
so
quickly
only
on
a
day
like
this
london
does
just
lie
heavily
upon
one
does
it
and
one
just
longs
for
the
country
a
little
breath
of
a
sigh
escaped
from
her
and
she
looked
through
her
window
at
the
dim
chimneys
the
clouds
hanging
like
consolidated
smoke
the
fine
thin
dust
that
filtered
the
air
you
looking
tired
yourself
peter
working
too
hard
no
he
shook
his
head
the
work
has
been
coming
easily
at
all
i
suppose
i
been
too
conscious
lately
of
the
criticisms
every
one
made
about
stone
house
i
do
believe
one
ought
really
to
listen
to
anybody
and
yet
it
so
hard
not
to
and
so
difficult
to
know
whose
opinion
one
ought
to
take
if
one
going
to
take
anybody
i
wish
he
suddenly
brought
out
henry
galleon
were
still
alive
i
could
have
followed
but
why
follow
anybody
ah
that
just
it
i
beginning
to
doubt
myself
and
that
why
getting
so
her
eyes
searched
his
face
and
she
saw
at
once
that
he
was
in
very
real
trouble
he
looked
younger
just
then
she
thought
than
she
had
ever
seen
him
and
she
felt
herself
so
immensely
old
that
she
could
have
taken
him
into
her
arms
and
mothered
him
as
though
he
been
her
own
son
there
are
a
lot
of
things
the
matter
she
said
tell
me
what
they
all
well
he
said
slowly
i
suppose
it
all
been
mostly
my
own
fault
but
the
real
difficulty
is
that
i
do
seem
to
be
able
to
run
the
business
of
being
married
and
the
business
of
writing
together
i
do
think
clare
in
the
least
cares
now
about
my
writing
she
almost
resents
it
she
cared
at
first
when
she
thought
that
i
was
going
to
make
a
huge
success
of
it
but
now
but
of
course
said
miss
monogue
that
success
comes
slowly
it
must
if
it
going
to
be
any
use
at
all
well
she
does
see
that
and
she
wants
me
to
go
out
to
parties
and
play
about
all
the
time
and
then
she
does
want
me
to
be
any
of
the
things
that
i
was
before
i
met
her
all
my
earlier
life
frightens
her
i
suppose
he
suddenly
ended
i
want
her
to
be
different
and
she
wants
me
to
be
different
and
we
ca
make
a
then
miss
monogue
said
have
any
outside
people
interfered
at
all
peter
coloured
well
of
course
rossiter
stands
up
for
clare
she
came
and
talked
to
me
this
morning
and
i
think
the
things
that
she
said
were
quite
true
i
suppose
i
am
morose
and
morbid
sometimes
more
than
i
realise
and
then
he
added
slowly
there
cards
cards
cardillac
a
man
i
was
at
school
with
i
very
fond
of
him
the
best
friend
i
got
and
he
been
all
over
the
place
and
done
everything
and
of
course
knows
ever
so
much
more
about
the
world
than
i
do
the
fact
is
he
thinks
really
that
my
novels
are
dreadful
nonsense
only
he
much
too
kind
to
say
so
and
of
course
clare
looks
up
to
him
a
lot
although
he
only
my
own
age
he
seems
so
much
older
than
both
clare
and
myself
i
do
believe
she
have
lost
interest
in
my
work
so
quickly
if
he
had
influenced
her
and
he
influenced
me
too
peter
added
sighing
well
and
is
there
anything
else
yes
there
stephen
i
ca
begin
to
tell
you
how
i
love
that
kid
there
have
been
many
people
in
my
life
that
i
cared
about
and
i
never
realised
anything
so
intensely
before
besides
he
went
on
laughing
proudly
he
such
a
splendid
kid
i
wish
you
could
see
him
norah
he
do
something
one
day
well
what
the
trouble
about
stephen
clare
so
odd
about
him
there
are
times
when
i
do
believe
she
cares
for
him
the
least
little
bit
then
there
are
other
times
when
she
resents
fiercely
my
interfering
about
him
sometimes
she
seems
to
love
him
more
than
anything
in
the
world
but
it
always
in
an
odd
defiant
way
just
as
though
she
were
afraid
that
something
would
hurt
her
if
she
showed
that
she
cared
too
there
was
silence
between
them
for
a
minute
and
then
peter
summed
it
all
up
with
the
fact
is
norah
that
every
sort
of
thing
getting
in
between
me
and
my
work
and
worries
me
it
as
though
i
were
tossing
more
balls
in
the
air
than
i
could
possibly
manage
at
one
moment
i
think
it
clare
that
i
got
especially
to
hang
on
to
another
time
it
the
book
and
then
it
stephen
the
moment
i
settled
down
something
turns
up
to
remind
me
of
cornwall
or
the
bookshop
fact
is
getting
battered
at
by
something
or
other
and
i
never
can
get
my
breath
i
ought
ever
to
have
married
i
not
up
to
norah
monogue
took
his
hand
you
are
up
to
it
peter
but
i
expect
you
got
a
lot
to
go
through
before
you
clear
of
things
now
i
going
to
be
brutal
the
fact
is
that
you
too
people
never
do
anything
in
the
world
so
long
as
they
are
wondering
whether
the
world
going
to
hurt
them
or
no
those
early
years
of
yours
made
you
morbid
you
got
a
temper
and
one
or
two
other
things
that
want
a
lot
of
holding
down
and
that
takes
up
your
attention
and
then
clare
is
the
woman
to
help
you
peter
was
about
to
break
in
but
she
went
on
oh
i
know
my
clare
through
and
through
she
just
as
anxious
as
you
are
not
to
be
hurt
by
anything
and
so
she
being
hurt
all
the
time
she
out
for
happiness
at
any
cost
and
you
out
for
freedom
freedom
from
every
kind
of
thing
and
because
both
of
you
are
denied
it
you
are
restive
but
you
and
clare
are
both
people
whose
only
salvation
is
in
being
hurt
and
knocked
about
and
bruised
to
such
an
extent
that
they
simply
do
know
where
they
are
oh
i
know
i
exactly
the
same
sort
of
person
myself
we
can
thank
the
gods
if
we
are
knocked
about
suddenly
she
paused
and
falling
back
in
her
chair
put
her
hand
to
her
breast
coughing
something
seized
her
held
her
in
its
grip
tossed
her
from
side
to
side
at
last
left
her
white
speechless
utterly
exhausted
it
had
come
so
suddenly
that
it
had
taken
peter
entirely
by
surprise
she
lay
back
now
her
eyes
closed
her
face
a
grey
white
he
ran
to
the
door
and
called
brockett
she
came
and
with
an
exclamation
hurried
away
for
remedies
peter
suddenly
felt
his
hand
seized
a
hoarse
whisper
was
in
his
ear
peter
dear
go
at
once
i
ca
bear
you
to
see
me
like
this
come
back
another
he
knelt
moved
by
an
affection
and
tenderness
that
seemed
stronger
than
any
emotion
he
had
ever
known
and
kissed
her
she
whispered
dear
boy
on
his
way
back
to
chelsea
the
orange
lamps
the
white
streets
powdered
with
the
evening
glow
the
rustling
plane
trees
whispered
to
him
you
got
to
be
knocked
about
you
got
to
be
knocked
about
got
to
be
knocked
about
but
the
murmur
was
no
longer
sinister
still
thinking
of
norah
he
went
up
to
the
nursery
to
see
the
boy
in
bed
he
remembered
that
clare
was
going
out
alone
to
a
party
and
that
he
would
have
the
evening
to
himself
on
entering
the
room
dark
except
for
a
nightlight
by
the
boy
bed
some
unknown
fear
assailed
him
he
was
instantly
at
the
threshold
conscious
of
it
he
stood
for
a
moment
in
silence
then
realised
what
it
was
the
boy
was
moaning
in
his
sleep
he
went
quickly
over
to
the
cot
and
bent
down
stephen
cheeks
were
flaming
his
hands
very
hot
peter
rang
the
bell
kant
appeared
is
there
anything
the
matter
with
stephen
kant
looked
at
him
surprised
a
little
offended
he
had
a
little
cold
all
day
sir
i
kept
him

you
taken
his
temperature
yes

all

often
goes
up
and
have
you
spoken
to
your
mistress
yes
sir
she
agrees
with
me
that
there
is
nothing
unusual
he
brushed
past
the
woman
and
went
to
his
wife
bedroom
she
was
dressed
and
was
putting
on
a
string
of
pearls
a
wedding
present
from
her
father
she
smiled
up
at
him
clare
do
you
know
stephen
ill
no
it
only
a
cold
i
been
up
to
see
him
he
took
her
hand
she
smiled
up
at
him
did
you
enjoy
your
visit
she
fastened
the
necklace
clare

in
it

the
boy

worse

what
you
want
now
clare

please

she
took
her
hand
gently
out
of
his
and
as
she
went
out
of
the
door
switched
off
the
electric
light
he
heard
the
opening
of
the
hall
door
and
standing
where
she
had
left
him
in
the
dark
bedroom
saw
shining
laughing
at
him
her
eyes
chapter
xi
why
i
there
are
occasions
in
our
life
when
the
great
wave
so
abruptly
overwhelms
us
that
before
we
have
recovered
our
dazed
senses
it
has
passed
and
the
water
on
every
side
of
us
is
calm
again
there
are
other
occasions
when
we
stand
it
may
seem
through
a
lifetime
of
anticipation
bracing
our
backs
for
the
inevitable
moment
every
hour
before
it
comes
is
darkened
every
light
is
dimmed
by
its
implacable
shadow
then
when
at
last
it
is
upon
us
we
meet
it
with
an
indifference
almost
with
a
relief
because
it
has
come
at
last
so
was
it
now
with
peter
during
many
weeks
he
had
been
miserable
apprehensive
seeing
an
enemy
in
every
wind
now
behold
his
adversary
in
the
open
this
he
might
cry
to
that
old
man
down
in
scaw
house
this
is
what
you
have
been
preparing
for
me
is
it
at
last
you
shown
me
well
i
fight
young
stephen
was
very
peter
was
strangely
assured
that
it
was
to
be
a
bad
business
well
it
rested
with
him
peter
to
pull
the
boy
through
if
he
chose
to
put
his
back
into
it
and
give
the
kid
some
of
his
own
vigour
and
strength
then
it
was
bound
to
be
all
right
standing
there
in
the
dark
he
stripped
his
mind
naked
he
flung
from
it
every
other
thought
every
other
interest
his
work
clare
everything
must
go
only
stephen
mattered
and
stephen
should
be
pulled
through
for
an
instant
a
little
cold
trembling
fear
struck
his
heart
supposing
then
fiercely
flinging
the
thought
from
him
he
trampled
it
down
he
went
to
the
telephone
and
called
up
a
doctor
who
lived
in
cheyne
walk
the
man
could
be
with
him
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
then
he
went
back
into
the
nursery
kant
was
there
i
sent
for
very
well
he
be
here
in
quarter
of
an
very
well
he
hated
the
woman
he
would
like
to
take
her
thin
bony
neck
and
wring
it
he
went
over
to
the
cot
and
looked
down
the
little
body
outlined
under
the
clothes
was
so
helpless
the
little
hands
clenched
now
were
so
tiny
he
was
breathing
very
fast
and
little
sounds
came
from
between
his
teeth
little
struggling
cries
peter
saw
that
moment
when
stephen
the
elder
had
held
stephen
the
younger
aloft
in
his
arms
the
gods
appear
to
us
only
when
we
claim
to
challenge
their
exultation
they
had
been
challenged
at
that
moment
young
stephen
against
the
gods
surely
an
unequal
contest
ii
mitchell
came
and
instantly
the
struggle
was
at
its
height
appendicitis
as
they
stood
over
the
cot
the
boy
awoke
and
began
to
cry
a
little
turned
his
head
from
side
to
side
as
though
to
avoid
the
light
beating
with
his
hands
on
the
counterpane
i
must
send
for
a
nurse
at
once
mitchell
said
everything
is
in
your
hands
peter
answered
you
better
go
down
and
have
something
to
the
little
cry
came
trembling
and
pitiful
driving
straight
into
heart
temperature
pretty
mitchell
who
was
a
stout
short
man
with
red
cheeks
grey
eyes
and
the
air
of
an
amiable
robin
was
transformed
now
into
something
sharp
alert
official
peter
caught
his
arm
it
all
right
you
do
think
the
man
turned
and
looked
at
him
with
eyes
so
kind
that
peter
trembled
look
here
we
got
to
fight
it
westcott
i
ought
to
have
been
called
hours
ago
but
keep
your
head
and
we
pull
the
child
through
better
go
down
and
have
something
to
eat
you
need
outside
the
door
peter
faced
a
trembling
kant
look
here
you
lied
just
now
you
never
took
the
boy
well
sir
did
you
or
not
well
sir
westcott
said
there
was
no
need
i
sure
i
thought
you
leave
the
house
now
at
once
go
up
and
pack
your
things
and
clear
out
if
i
see
you
here
in
an
hour
time
the
police
shall
turn
you
the
woman
began
to
cry
peter
went
downstairs
to
his
own
surprise
he
found
that
he
could
eat
and
drink
of
so
fundamental
an
importance
was
young
stephen
in
his
life
that
the
idea
that
he
could
ever
lose
him
was
of
an
absurd
and
monstrous
incredibility
no
of
that
there
was
no
question
but
he
was
conscious
nevertheless
of
the
supreme
urgency
of
the
occasion
that
young
stephen
had
ever
been
delicate
or
in
any
way
a
weakling
was
a
monstrous
suggestion
always
when
one
thought
of
him
it
was
a
baby
laughing
tumbling
or
thoughtfully
with
his
hand
rolled
tightly
inside
his
father
taking
in
the
world
just
think
of
all
the
tottering
creatures
who
go
on
and
on
and
snap
their
fingers
at
death
the
grotesque
old
men
and
women
or
think
of
the
feeble
miserables
who
never
know
what
a
day
health
means
crowding
into
davos
or
shuddering
on
the
riviera
and
young
stephen
the
strongest
most
vital
thing
in
the
world
nevertheless
suddenly
peter
found
that
he
could
eat
and
drink
no
more
he
put
the
food
aside
and
went
upstairs
again
in
the
darkened
nursery
he
sat
in
a
chair
by
the
fire
and
waited
for
the
hours
to
pass
the
new
nurse
had
arrived
and
moved
quietly
about
the
room
there
was
no
sound
at
all
save
the
monotonous
whispering
beseeching
little
cries
that
came
from
the
bed
one
had
heard
that
concentration
of
will
might
do
so
much
in
the
directing
of
such
a
battle
and
surely
great
love
must
help
peter
as
he
sat
in
the
thought
that
he
had
never
before
realised
his
love
for
the
boy
how
immense
it
was
how
so
that
if
it
were
taken
from
him
life
would
be
instantly
broken
without
colour
without
any
rhythm
or
force
as
he
sat
there
he
thought
confusedly
of
a
great
number
of
things
of
his
own
childhood
of
his
mother
of
a
boy
at
dawson
who
had
asked
him
once
as
they
gazed
up
at
a
great
mass
of
apple
blossoms
in
bloom
do
you
think
there
is
anything
in
all
that
stuff
about
god
anyway
westcott
of
a
night
when
he
had
gone
with
some
loose
woman
of
the
town
and
of
the
wet
miry
street
that
they
had
left
behind
them
as
she
had
closed
the
door
of
that
night
at
the
party
when
he
had
seen
cardillac
again
of
the
things
that
maradick
had
said
to
him
that
night
when
young
stephen
was
born
and
so
from
that
to
his
own
life
his
own
birth
his
father
scaw
house
the
struggle
that
it
had
all
been
he
remembered
a
sentence
out
of
a
strange
novel
of
dostoieffsky
that
he
had
once
read
the
brothers
karamazoff
it
a
feature
of
the
karamazoffs
that
thirst
for
life
regardless
of
everything
and
the
karamazoffs
were
of
a
sensual
debased
stock
rotten
at
the
base
of
them
with
an
old
drunken
buffoon
of
a
father
yes
that
was
like
the
westcotts
all
his
life
struggle
and
young
stephen
all
life
struggle
and
yet
even
in
the
depths
of
degradation
if
the
fight
were
to
go
that
way
there
would
still
be
that
lust
for
life
so
many
times
he
had
been
almost
under
first
stephen
brant
had
saved
him
then
at
brockett
norah
monogue
then
in
bucket
lane
his
illness
then
in
chelsea
his
marriage
lately
young
stephen
always
always
something
had
been
there
to
keep
him
on
his
feet
but
if
everything
were
taken
from
him
if
he
were
absolutely
nakedly
alone
what
then
ah
what
then
he
buried
his
head
in
his
hands
god
you
do
know
what
young
stephen
is
to
me
or
yes
of
course
you
do
know
god
and
because
you
do
know
you
will
not
take
him
from
the
little
tearing
pain
at
his
heart
held
him
every
now
and
again
it
turned
like
some
grinding
key
mitchell
entered
with
another
doctor
peter
went
over
to
the
window
and
whilst
they
made
their
examination
stared
through
the
glass
at
the
fretwork
of
trees
the
golden
haze
of
london
beyond
two
stars
that
now
when
the
storm
had
spent
itself
showed
in
a
dark
dim
sky
very
faintly
the
clanging
note
of
trams
the
clatter
of
a
hansom
cab
the
imperative
call
of
some
bell
came
to
him
the
world
could
thus
go
on
mitchell
crossed
to
him
and
put
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
he
pretty
bad
westcott
an
operation
out
of
the
question
afraid
but
if
you
like
another
opinion
no
thanks
i
trust
you
and
the
doctor
could
feel
the
boy
body
trembling
beneath
his
touch
it
all
right
westcott
do
be
frightened
we
do
all
mortals
can
we
know
in
the
early
morning
how
things
are
going
to
be
the
child
got
a
splendid
he
was
interrupted
by
the
opening
of
the
nursery
door
and
turning
the
men
saw
clare
with
the
light
of
the
passage
at
her
back
standing
in
the
doorway
her
cloak
was
trailing
on
the
floor
around
her
her
pink
filmy
dress
hung
like
shadows
from
the
light
behind
her
her
face
was
white
her
eyes
wide
what
she
whispered
in
the
voice
of
a
frightened
child
peter
crossed
the
room
and
took
her
with
him
into
the
passage
closing
the
door
behind
him
she
clung
to
him
looking
up
into
his
face
stephen
very
bad
dear
no
it
something
internal
and
i
went
out
to
a
party
her
voice
was
trembling
she
was
very
near
to
tears
but
i
was
miserable
wretched
all
the
time
i
wanted
to
come
back
i
knew
i
ought
to
have
gone
oh
peter
will
he
die
oh
poor
little
thing
poor
little
thing
even
at
that
moment
peter
noticed
she
spoke
as
though
it
were
somebody
else
baby
no
no
dear
it
be
all
right
of
course
it
will
mitchell
here
he
pull
him
through
but
you
better
go
and
lie
down
dear
i
promise
to
come
and
tell
you
if
anything
the
matter
you
ca
do
any
good
there
an
excellent
nurse
where
kant
i
dismissed
her
this
evening
for
lying
to
me
go
to
bed
clare
really
it
the
best
she
began
to
cry
with
her
hands
up
to
her
face
but
she
went
slowly
with
her
cloak
still
trailing
after
her
to
her
room
she
had
not
he
noticed
entered
the
nursery
iii
he
went
back
and
sat
down
again
in
the
by
the
fire
poor
clare
he
felt
only
a
great
protecting
pity
for
her
a
strange
feeling
compounded
of
emotions
that
were
unexpectedly
confused
a
feeling
that
was
akin
to
what
he
would
have
felt
had
she
been
his
sister
and
been
insulted
by
some
drunken
blackguard
in
the
street
poor
clare
she
was
so
young
simply
not
up
to
these
big
troubles
those
little
cries
had
ceased
only
every
now
and
again
an
echo
of
a
moan
so
slight
was
the
sound
that
broke
the
silence
the
hours
advanced
and
there
settled
about
the
house
that
chilly
ominous
sense
of
anticipation
that
the
early
morning
brings
in
its
grey
melancholy
hands
it
was
a
little
house
but
it
was
full
now
of
expectancy
up
the
stairs
through
the
passages
pressing
against
the
windows
there
were
many
presences
waiting
for
the
moment
when
the
issue
of
this
struggle
would
be
decided
the
air
was
filled
with
their
chill
breath
the
struggle
round
the
bed
was
at
its
height
on
one
side
doctors
nurses
the
father
the
mother
on
the
other
that
still
ironic
figure
in
his
very
aloofness
so
strong
in
his
indifference
so
terrible
with
peter
as
the
grey
dawn
grew
nearer
confidence
fled
he
was
suddenly
conscious
of
the
strength
and
invisibility
of
the
thing
that
he
was
fighting
he
must
do
something
if
he
were
compelled
to
sit
silently
quietly
with
his
hands
folded
much
longer
he
would
go
mad
but
it
was
absurd
stephen
about
whom
he
had
made
so
many
plans
stephen
concerning
whom
there
had
been
that
struggle
to
bring
about
his
very
existence
surely
all
that
was
not
now
to
go
for
nothing
at
all
if
he
could
do
something
if
he
could
do
something
there
were
drops
of
sweat
on
his
forehead
inside
his
clothes
his
body
was
hot
and
dry
and
had
shrunk
it
seemed
into
some
tiny
shape
like
a
nut
so
that
his
things
hung
loosely
all
about
him
he
could
not
bear
that
dark
cavernous
nursery
with
the
faint
lights
and
the
stairs
and
passages
beyond
it
so
crowded
with
urgent
silence
he
caught
mitchell
on
the
shoulder
how
is
it
oh
we
fighting
it
it
the
most
rapid
thing
i
ever
known
if
we
only
could
have
operated
look
here
go
and
lie
down
for
a
bit
i
let
you
know
if
there
any
change
he
went
to
his
all
ghostly
now
with
the
first
struggling
light
of
dawn
he
closed
the
door
behind
him
and
then
fell
down
on
his
knees
by
the
bed
pressing
his
face
into
his
hands
he
prayed
oh
god
god
god
i
have
never
wanted
anything
like
this
before
but
stephen
is
more
to
me
much
much
more
to
me
than
anything
that
i
have
ever
had
more
far
more
than
my
own
life
i
have
much
to
offer
but
if
you
will
let
me
keep
stephen
you
can
have
all
the
rest
you
can
send
me
back
to
bucket
lane
take
my
work
anything
i
want
stephen
i
want
stephen
god
he
is
such
a
good
boy
he
has
always
been
good
and
he
will
make
such
a
fine
man
there
wo
be
many
men
so
fine
as
he
he
good
as
gold
god
i
will
die
myself
if
he
may
live
no
use
i
made
a
mess
of
things
but
let
him
live
and
take
me
oh
god
i
want
him
i
want
him
he
broke
into
sobs
and
was
bowed
down
there
on
the
floor
his
body
quivering
his
face
pressed
against
the
bed
he
was
conscious
that
clare
had
joined
him
she
must
have
heard
him
from
her
room
he
tried
as
he
felt
her
body
pressed
against
his
to
pull
himself
together
but
the
crying
now
had
mastered
him
and
he
could
only
feel
her
pushing
with
her
hand
to
find
his
and
at
last
he
let
her
take
his
hand
and
hold
it
he
heard
her
whisper
in
his
ear
peter
dear
do
do
cry
like
that
i
ca
bear
to
hear
you
like
that
i
so
miserable
peter
i
been
so
wicked
so
cross
and
selfish
i
hurt
you
so
often
i
going
to
be
better
peter
i
am
at
that
moment
they
might
have
come
together
with
a
reality
an
honesty
that
no
could
have
shaken
but
to
peter
clare
was
very
far
away
he
was
not
so
conscious
of
her
as
he
was
of
those
presences
that
thronged
the
house
what
could
she
do
for
him
now
afterwards
perhaps
but
now
it
was
stephen
stephen
stephen
but
he
let
her
hold
his
hand
and
he
felt
her
hair
against
his
cheek
and
at
last
he
put
his
arm
around
her
and
held
her
close
to
him
and
she
with
her
face
against
his
went
fast
asleep
he
looked
down
at
her
she
looked
so
young
and
helpless
that
the
sight
of
her
leaning
tired
and
beaten
against
him
touched
him
and
he
picked
her
up
carried
her
into
her
room
and
laid
her
on
her
bed
how
light
and
tiny
she
was
he
was
conscious
of
his
own
immense
fatigue
mitchell
had
told
him
that
he
would
wake
him
good
fellow
mitchell
he
lay
down
on
the
bed
in
his
and
was
instantly
asleep
he
was
outside
scaw
house
he
was
and
the
howling
wind
and
rain
buffeted
his
body
and
the
stones
cut
his
feet
the
windows
of
the
house
were
dark
and
barred
he
could
just
reach
the
lower
windows
with
his
hands
if
he
stood
on
tiptoe
he
tapped
again
and
again
he
was
tired
exhausted
he
had
come
a
long
long
way
and
the
rain
hurt
his
bare
flesh
at
last
a
candle
shone
dimly
behind
the
dark
window
some
one
was
there
and
instantly
at
the
moment
of
his
realising
that
aid
had
come
he
was
conscious
also
that
he
must
on
all
accounts
refuse
it
he
knew
that
if
he
entered
the
house
stephen
would
die
it
depended
on
him
to
save
stephen
he
turned
to
flee
but
his
father
had
unbarred
the
door
and
was
drawing
him
in
he
struggled
he
cried
out
he
fought
but
his
father
was
stronger
than
he
he
was
on
the
threshold
he
could
see
through
the
dark
hall
to
the
door
beyond
his
hand
fastened
on
his
arm
like
a
vice
his
body
was
bathed
in
sweat
he
screamed
and
woke
to
find
the
room
dim
in
the
morning
light
and
mitchell
shaking
him
by
the
arm
iv
he
was
still
dreaming
now
he
was
in
the
nursery
clare
was
kneeling
by
stephen
bed
one
doctor
was
bending
down
the
nurse
was
crying
very
softly
he
looked
down
on
his
son
as
he
looked
the
little
face
was
for
an
instant
puckered
with
pain
the
mouth
the
eyes
the
throat
struggled
the
tiny
hands
lifted
for
a
moment
hung
and
then
like
fluttering
leaves
fell
down
on
to
the
counterpane
then
the
body
was
suddenly
quiet
the
face
was
peaceful
and
the
head
had
fallen
gently
sideways
against
the
pillow
at
that
moment
of
time
throughout
the
house
the
presences
departed
the
passages
the
rooms
were
freed
the
air
was
no
longer
cold
at
that
moment
also
peter
awoke
mitchell
said
the
boy
gone
peter
turning
his
back
upon
them
all
drove
from
him
so
softly
that
they
could
scarcely
hear
but
in
a
voice
of
agony
that
mitchell
never
afterwards
forgot
i
wanted
him
so
i
wanted
him
chapter
xii
a
woman
called
rose
bennett
i
the
days
that
followed
were
dead
dead
in
more
than
any
ordinary
sense
of
the
word
but
perhaps
it
was
peter
who
was
dead
he
moved
ate
drank
even
wrote
his
reviews
slept
he
thanked
gravely
all
those
who
offered
him
condolences
wrote
letters
in
answer
to
kind
friends
dear
s
it
was
just
like
you
to
write
so
kindly
and
sympathetically
and
all
this
time
he
was
without
any
kind
of
emotion
he
was
aware
that
there
was
something
in
the
back
of
his
brain
that
were
it
once
called
upon
to
awake
might
stir
him
into
life
again
what
it
would
tell
him
he
did
not
know
something
about
love
something
intensely
sorrowful
something
that
had
occurred
very
probably
to
himself
he
did
not
want
to
live
to
think
to
feel
thinking
meant
pain
meant
a
sudden
penetrating
into
that
room
shrouded
now
by
heavy
black
curtains
but
containing
were
those
curtains
drawn
some
great
phantasmal
horror
he
was
dimly
aware
that
the
people
about
him
were
frightened
clare
bobby
galleon
cardillac
he
knew
that
they
would
be
glad
for
him
to
draw
those
curtains
aside
and
penetrate
into
that
farther
room
that
was
unkind
of
them
he
had
no
other
emotion
but
that
it
was
unkind
of
them
beyond
that
unkindness
they
did
not
exist
he
was
thinner
his
shoulders
seemed
to
pierce
sharply
his
clothes
his
cheeks
were
white
and
hollow
there
were
dark
lines
beneath
his
eyes
dark
grey
patches
his
legs
were
not
so
straight
nor
so
strong
moreover
his
eyes
were
as
though
they
were
covered
with
a
film
seeing
everything
they
yet
saw
nothing
at
all
they
passed
through
the
world
and
were
confronted
by
the
heavy
veiling
curtains
this
condition
lasted
for
many
days
of
all
about
him
none
understood
him
so
well
as
bobby
galleon
bobby
had
always
understood
him
and
now
he
felt
for
him
with
a
tenderness
that
had
both
the
past
and
the
future
to
heighten
its
poignancy
it
seemed
to
bobby
that
nothing
more
tragic
than
the
death
of
this
child
could
possibly
have
occurred
it
filled
him
with
anxiety
for
the
future
it
intensified
to
a
depth
that
only
so
simple
and
affectionate
a
character
as
his
could
feel
the
love
that
he
had
always
had
for
peter
he
was
with
him
during
these
days
continually
waiting
for
the
relief
to
come
it
got
to
come
soon
he
said
or
the
boy
go
at
last
it
came
one
day
about
they
were
sitting
in
peter
upstairs
study
it
had
been
a
day
of
showers
and
now
the
curtains
were
not
drawn
and
a
dusk
glimmered
beyond
the
windows
peter
was
writing
letters
and
as
bobby
watched
him
he
seemed
to
him
like
some
automaton
something
wound
into
life
by
some
clever
inventor
the
hand
moved
across
the
paper
the
dead
eyes
encountered
nothing
in
their
gaze
the
shoulders
were
the
loosely
drooping
shoulders
of
an
old
man
can
you
see
peter
yes
thanks
switch
on
the
light
if
you
bobby
got
up
and
moved
to
the
door
the
dusk
behind
peter
face
flung
it
into
sharp
white
outline
another
shower
the
rain
at
first
in
single
drops
then
more
swiftly
fell
with
gentle
pattering
fingers
up
and
down
the
window
it
was
the
only
sound
except
the
scraping
of
peter
pen
the
pen
stopped
peter
raised
his
head
listening
bobby
switched
on
the
light
and
as
he
did
so
peter
in
a
strangled
breathless
mutter
whispered
the
rain
the
rain
it
was
like
that
that
night
stephen
stephen
his
head
fell
on
to
his
hands
and
he
burst
into
a
storm
of
tears
ii
and
now
peter
was
out
to
be
hurt
hurt
more
horribly
than
he
could
have
ever
believed
possible
it
was
like
walking
as
they
did
in
the
days
of
the
ordeal
on
iron
every
step
an
agony
always
there
was
something
to
remind
him
he
could
go
nowhere
see
nobody
summon
no
kind
of
recollection
out
of
the
past
without
this
coming
to
him
there
were
a
thousand
things
that
stephen
had
done
that
he
peter
had
never
noticed
at
the
time
he
was
haunted
now
with
regrets
he
had
not
made
enough
of
him
whilst
he
was
there
ah
had
he
only
known
that
the
time
was
to
be
so
short
how
he
would
have
spent
those
precious
precious
moments
it
was
as
though
he
had
flung
away
wilfully
possessions
of
the
utmost
price
cast
them
off
as
though
it
had
been
his
very
intention
to
feel
afterwards
this
burning
regret
the
things
in
the
nursery
were
packed
away
but
there
remained
the
room
the
frieze
with
the
dragons
and
princesses
the
the
high
broad
window
again
and
again
he
saw
babies
in
the
streets
in
the
parks
and
fancied
that
stephen
had
come
back
again
the
thing
had
happened
to
him
so
swiftly
that
behind
reason
there
lurked
the
thought
that
perhaps
with
equal
suddenness
stephen
would
be
restored
to
come
back
one
afternoon
and
to
find
him
there
to
find
him
lying
there
on
his
back
in
his
cot
looking
up
at
the
ceiling
to
find
him
labouring
unsteadily
on
his
feet
clinging
to
the
sides
of
his
bed
and
shouting
to
find
him
laughing
at
the
jumping
waves
in
the
fire
to
find
him
no
never
to
be
found
again
gone
hopelessly
cruelly
for
no
reason
for
no
one
good
or
benefit
simply
for
some
one
sport
but
strangely
more
than
the
actual
stephen
did
he
miss
the
imaginary
future
stephen
at
school
hero
of
a
thousand
games
winner
of
a
thousand
prizes
the
stephen
grown
up
famous
already
at
so
young
an
age
loved
by
men
and
women
handsome
good
oh
the
folly
of
it
no
human
being
could
carry
all
the
glories
that
peter
had
designed
for
his
son
no
human
being
then
how
much
less
a
westcott
it
might
be
best
after
all
young
stephen
had
been
spared
until
every
stone
of
scaw
house
was
level
with
the
ground
no
westcott
could
be
termed
safe
perhaps
not
then
now
he
realised
how
huge
a
place
in
his
heart
the
boy
had
filled
dimly
because
as
yet
he
refused
to
bring
it
to
the
open
light
he
was
conscious
that
during
these
past
two
years
he
had
been
save
for
stephen
a
very
lonely
man
it
was
odd
that
stephen
the
elder
and
stephen
the
younger
should
have
been
the
only
two
persons
in
his
life
to
find
the
real
inside
of
him
they
too
and
perhaps
norah
monogue
but
otherwise
not
bobby
nor
cards
nor
alice
galleon
nor
zanti
nor
clare
not
clare
he
faced
the
fact
with
a
sudden
shudder
now
that
stephen
was
gone
he
and
clare
were
face
to
face
face
to
face
as
they
had
never
been
since
that
first
happy
year
of
their
marriage
that
first
year
of
their
marriage
and
now
with
an
instant
clenching
of
his
teeth
he
pulled
down
the
blinds
upon
that
desolating
view
iii
with
teeth
still
clenched
he
set
himself
to
build
up
his
house
again
clare
was
very
quiet
and
submissive
during
those
first
weeks
her
little
figure
looked
helpless
and
appealing
in
its
deep
black
she
was
prettier
than
she
had
ever
been
in
her
life
before
people
said
poor
westcott
she
feels
the
loss
of
her
baby
so
dreadfully
and
they
think
about
peter
indeed
some
people
thought
him
callous
mr
westcott
seemed
to
be
so
fond
of
the
child
now
i
really
believe
he
forgotten
all
about
bobby
was
the
only
person
in
the
world
who
knew
how
peter
suffered
clare
was
indeed
after
a
time
reassured
peter
after
all
seemed
not
to
mind
did
he
mind
anything
he
was
so
often
glum
and
silent
that
really
you
could
tell
clare
herself
had
been
frightened
on
that
night
when
the
baby
had
died
she
had
probably
never
in
all
her
life
felt
a
more
genuine
emotion
than
she
had
known
when
she
knelt
by
side
and
went
to
sleep
in
his
arms
she
was
quite
ready
to
feel
that
emotion
again
would
peter
but
allow
her
but
no
he
showed
no
emotion
himself
and
expected
no
one
else
to
show
any
for
he
was
ready
to
share
it
but
in
her
heart
of
hearts
she
longed
to
fling
away
from
her
this
emotional
atmosphere
she
had
loved
the
baby
of
course
she
had
loved
it
but
she
had
always
known
that
something
would
happen
to
it
always
if
peter
would
insist
on
having
those
horrid
cornishmen
at
heart
she
connected
that
dreadful
day
when
those
horrible
men
had
played
about
in
the
nursery
with
baby
death
of
course
it
was
enough
to
kill
any
baby
so
ultimately
it
all
came
back
to
peter
fault
clare
found
real
satisfaction
in
the
thought
meanwhile
she
emphatically
stated
her
desire
to
be
happy
again
she
stated
it
always
in
peter
absence
feeling
that
he
would
in
no
way
understand
her
it
ca
help
poor
dear
little
stephen
that
we
should
go
on
being
melancholy
and
doing
nothing
that
only
morbid
is
it
mother
rossiter
entirely
agreed
as
indeed
she
always
agreed
with
anything
that
clare
suggested
the
dear
thing
does
look
lovely
in
black
though
she
confided
to
galleon
mr
cardillac
could
take
his
eyes
off
her
yesterday
at
rossiter
and
jerry
cardillac
had
during
the
last
year
become
the
very
best
of
friends
peter
was
glad
to
see
that
it
was
so
peter
could
pretend
to
care
very
deeply
about
his
but
he
felt
that
it
would
do
her
all
the
good
in
the
world
to
see
something
of
old
cards
it
would
broaden
her
understanding
give
her
perhaps
some
of
that
charity
towards
the
whole
world
that
was
one
of
cards
most
charming
features
cards
in
fact
had
been
so
much
in
the
house
lately
that
he
might
be
considered
one
of
the
family
no
one
could
have
been
more
tender
more
sympathetic
more
exactly
right
about
young
death
he
had
become
during
those
weeks
almost
a
necessity
he
seemed
to
have
no
particular
interest
of
his
own
in
life
he
dressed
very
perfectly
he
went
to
a
number
of
parties
he
had
delightful
little
gatherings
in
his
own
flat
but
with
it
all
he
was
something
more
a
great
deal
more
than
the
mere
society
idler
there
was
a
hint
at
possible
wildness
an
almost
sinister
suggestion
of
possible
lawlessness
that
made
him
infinitely
attractive
he
was
such
good
company
and
yet
one
felt
that
one
did
know
nearly
the
whole
of
him
to
peter
he
was
the
most
wonderful
thing
in
the
world
to
clare
he
was
rapidly
becoming
so
no
wonder
then
that
the
roundabout
saw
him
so
often
iv
it
would
need
a
very
acute
perception
indeed
to
pursue
precisely
the
train
of
cause
and
effect
in
rossiter
mind
after
young
death
her
black
garments
added
in
the
most
astonishing
fashion
to
her
placid
flatness
if
she
had
gloried
before
in
an
armour
that
was
so
negative
that
it
became
instantly
exceedingly
dangerous
her
appearance
now
was
terrifying
beyond
all
words
her
black
silk
had
apparently
no
creases
no
folds
it
almost
eliminated
terms
and
boundaries
rossiter
could
not
now
be
said
to
come
into
a
room
she
was
simply
there
one
was
sitting
gazing
it
might
be
at
the
fire
a
a
picture
or
two
when
suddenly
there
came
a
black
shadow
something
that
changed
the
colour
of
things
a
little
something
that
obscured
certain
objects
but
scarcely
anything
more
definite
the
yellow
brooch
was
definite
cold
stony
eyes
hung
a
little
above
it
over
those
a
high
white
forehead
otherwise
merely
a
black
shadow
putting
out
the
fire
she
was
in
the
roundabout
now
all
the
time
how
poor
rossiter
fared
it
was
difficult
to
imagine
but
he
cared
for
clare
as
deeply
as
his
wife
did
and
was
quite
ready
for
everything
to
be
sacrificed
to
her
at
this
crisis
of
her
history
rossiter
meanwhile
was
entirely
convinced
that
peter
was
responsible
for
his
son
death
had
you
suddenly
challenged
her
and
demanded
her
reasoned
argument
with
regard
to
this
matter
she
would
probably
have
failed
you
she
did
not
like
reasoned
arguments
but
she
would
also
have
been
most
sincerely
indignant
had
you
called
her
a
liar
and
would
have
sworn
to
her
convictions
before
a
court
of
law
those
cornishmen
had
frightened
the
poor
little
thing
into
fits
and
it
was
only
to
be
expected
moreover
it
followed
from
this
that
a
man
who
murdered
his
only
child
would
most
assuredly
take
to
beating
his
wife
before
very
long
after
that
anything
might
happen
peter
was
on
a
swift
road
to
being
a
perfect
indeed
allow
rossiter
two
consecutive
hours
of
peace
and
quiet
she
sitting
like
the
personification
of
the
english
climate
alone
before
her
fire
and
she
could
make
any
one
into
anything
once
made
so
they
remained
it
mattered
nothing
to
her
that
poor
peter
was
during
these
weeks
the
most
subdued
and
gently
courteous
of
husbands
that
was
as
it
might
be
a
favourite
phrase
of
hers
she
knew
him
and
so
knowing
waited
for
the
inevitable
end
but
the
more
certain
she
was
of
his
villainous
possibilities
the
more
placid
she
became
she
spread
her
placidity
over
everything
it
lay
like
an
invisible
glue
upon
everything
in
the
roundabout
you
could
feel
it
on
the
as
you
feel
the
jammy
reminiscences
of
incautious
peter
felt
it
but
did
not
know
what
it
was
that
he
had
to
deal
with
he
had
determined
when
the
sharpest
shock
of
stephen
death
had
passed
and
he
was
able
to
think
of
other
things
that
the
supremely
important
thing
for
him
now
to
do
was
to
get
back
to
his
old
relations
with
clare
there
was
he
grimly
reflected
mortimer
stant
to
be
finished
within
a
month
or
two
and
he
knew
perfectly
well
with
the
assurance
of
past
experience
that
whilst
clare
held
the
stage
mortimer
had
the
poorest
of
chances
nevertheless
clare
was
at
this
moment
the
thing
to
struggle
for
he
get
her
back
he
get
her
back
behind
his
brain
all
this
time
was
the
horror
of
being
left
alone
in
the
world
and
of
what
he
might
do
then
to
get
clare
back
he
must
have
the
assistance
of
two
people
rossiter
and
cards
it
was
at
this
point
that
he
perceived
rossiter
placidity
he
could
not
get
at
her
at
all
he
could
not
get
near
her
he
tried
in
every
way
during
these
weeks
to
please
her
she
apparently
noticed
nothing
he
could
force
no
direct
opinion
about
anything
from
her
and
yet
he
was
conscious
of
opposition
he
was
conscious
of
opposition
increasingly
every
day
i
believe
she
clare
to
hate
me
he
suddenly
revealed
to
himself
and
with
that
all
hope
of
her
as
an
ally
vanished
then
he
hated
her
he
hated
her
more
bitterly
every
day
he
wanted
to
tell
her
not
to
call
him
peter
dear
she
loved
to
put
him
in
positions
that
showed
him
in
the
worst
light
to
clare
at
luncheon
for
instance
peter
dear
it
would
be
a
nice
thing
for
you
and
clare
to
go
to
that
private
view
at
the
carfax
this
afternoon
you
nothing
to
do
clare
have
you
peter
knew
that
rossiter
had
already
ascertained
that
he
was
engaged
he
knew
also
that
clare
had
had
no
thought
of
peter
company
before
but
that
now
she
would
very
speedily
feel
herself
injured
i
afraid
peter
would
begin
peter
too
engaged
to
take
you
clare
i
dare
say
jerry
will
come
this
from
clare
ah
yes
cardillac
is
always
ready
to
take
any
trouble
if
you
let
me
know
earlier
clare
that
you
wanted
rossiter
oh
do
put
yourself
out
peter
it
would
never
do
to
break
an
engagement
only
it
seems
such
a
long
time
since
you
and
clare
peter
we
go
afternoon
clare
you
so
gloomy
when
you
do
come
peter
it
like
going
out
with
a
rossiter
ah
peter
has
his
work
dear
so
much
hangs
on
the
next
book
does
it
peter
naturally
the
last
one
did
quite
peter
look
here
clare
i
chuck
this
clare
no
thank
you
peter
jerry
and
i
will
be
all
right
you
can
join
us
if
you
like
the
fact
was
that
peter
was
tactful
he
showed
rossiter
much
too
plainly
that
he
disliked
her
intensely
he
had
no
idea
that
he
showed
it
her
he
thought
indeed
that
he
was
very
skilful
in
his
disguise
of
his
feelings
but
rossiter
knew
and
soon
clare
knew
also
peter
had
no
conception
of
subtlety
in
the
matter
it
was
clear
to
him
that
he
had
once
been
devoted
to
clare
and
she
to
him
it
was
clear
also
that
that
relationship
had
recently
been
dimmed
now
that
stephen
was
gone
that
early
intimacy
must
be
restored
and
the
fact
that
he
was
willing
on
his
side
to
do
anything
to
bring
it
back
seemed
to
him
reason
enough
for
its
restoration
that
the
whole
matter
was
composed
of
the
most
delicate
and
intricate
threads
never
occurred
to
him
for
an
instant
clare
had
loved
him
once
clare
would
love
him
again
and
the
sooner
it
happened
the
better
for
him
meanwhile
rossiter
being
enemy
rather
than
ally
there
remained
cards
but
cards
was
strange
peter
could
never
claim
to
have
been
intimate
with
him
their
relationship
had
been
founded
on
an
inequality
on
a
recognition
from
peter
of
cards
superiority
cards
had
always
laughed
at
peter
always
patronised
him
but
now
although
cards
had
been
in
the
place
so
much
of
late
the
distance
seemed
farther
than
ever
before
cards
was
as
kind
as
he
could
be
always
in
good
spirits
always
ready
to
do
anything
but
peter
noticed
that
it
was
only
when
clare
was
present
that
cards
changed
from
jest
to
earnest
he
thinks
clare
worth
talking
to
seriously
i
suppose
it
because
he
was
at
dawson
but
after
all
i
not
an
this
attitude
of
cards
was
in
fact
as
vague
and
nebulous
as
all
the
other
things
that
seemed
now
to
stand
between
peter
and
clare
peter
tried
to
talk
to
cards
he
was
always
prevented
held
off
with
a
laughing
hand
what
the
matter
with
me
thought
peter
what
have
i
done
it
like
being
out
in
a
at
last
one
evening
after
dinner
when
clare
and
rossiter
had
gone
upstairs
he
demanded
an
answer
look
here
cards
what
have
i
done
you
profess
to
be
a
friend
of
mine
tell
me
what
crime
i
committed
cards
eyes
had
been
laughing
suddenly
he
was
serious
his
dark
face
was
stern
almost
accusing
profess
peter
i
hope
you
do
doubt
it
no
of
course
not
you
know
you
the
best
friend
i
got
tell
me
what
have
i
done
done
yes
you
and
clare
and
her
mother
all
of
you
keep
me
at
length
why
do
you
really
want
a
straight
talking
of
well
i
can
only
speak
for
myself
but
to
tell
the
truth
old
boy
i
think
you
been
rather
hard
on
poor
little
for
the
first
time
since
his
marriage
peter
resented
cards
words
poor
little
clare
was
that
a
little
too
intimate
what
do
you
mean
he
asked
his
voice
a
little
harder
well
i
do
think
you
understand
her
she
a
happy
merry
person
if
ever
there
was
one
in
this
world
she
wants
all
the
happiness
you
can
give
her
well
well
you
do
seem
to
see
that
of
course
young
stephen
death
let
leave
that
peter
voice
was
harder
again
oh
all
right
just
as
you
please
but
most
men
would
have
seen
what
a
shock
it
must
be
to
a
girl
so
young
who
knew
so
little
about
the
cruelty
of
life
you
did
you
do
mind
peter
do
you
you
seem
to
think
of
that
never
tried
to
cheer
her
up
take
her
about
take
her
out
of
herself
you
just
wrapped
yourself
up
you
do
understand
muttered
peter
his
eyes
lowered
if
thought
that
she
really
minded
stephen
death
oh
come
peter
that
grossly
unfair
why
she
felt
it
all
most
horribly
that
shows
how
little
you
understood
her
how
little
appreciated
her
you
always
been
a
gloomy
morbid
devil
and
all
right
cards
that
cards
stood
back
from
the
table
his
mouth
smiling
his
eyes
hard
and
cold
oh
no
it
wo
you
asked
for
it
and
now
you
going
to
get
it
you
not
only
been
gloomy
and
morbid
all
your
life
you
been
selfish
as
well
always
thinking
of
yourself
and
the
books
you
were
going
to
write
and
then
when
they
did
come
they
were
such
great
shakes
you
ought
to
have
married
at
all
you
never
considered
clare
at
all
your
treatment
of
her
peter
stood
up
his
face
white
so
that
his
eyes
and
the
lines
of
his
mouth
showed
black
in
the
shadow
clear
out
i
heard
oh
that
just
like
you
ask
me
for
my
opinion
and
then
lose
your
temper
over
it
really
peter
you
like
a
boy
of
ten
you
deserve
to
be
treated
as
a
peter
voice
shook
clear
out
clear
out
or
i
do
for
you
get
out
of
my
house
cards
opened
the
door
and
was
gone
peter
heard
him
hesitate
for
a
moment
in
the
hall
get
his
hat
and
coat
and
then
close
the
after
him
the
house
was
suddenly
silent
peter
stood
his
hands
clenched
then
he
went
out
into
the
hall
he
heard
rossiter
voice
from
above
are
you
two
men
ever
coming
up
jerry
gone
yes
we
had
a
rossiter
made
no
reply
he
heard
the
door
close
then
he
too
took
his
coat
and
hat
and
went
out
v
the
night
was
cool
and
sweet
with
a
great
silver
haze
of
stars
above
the
sharply
outlined
roofs
and
chimneys
the
golden
mist
from
the
streets
met
the
night
air
and
mingled
with
it
peter
walked
furiously
without
thinking
of
direction
some
clock
struck
nine
his
temper
faded
swiftly
leaving
him
cold
miserable
regretful
there
went
his
damnable
temper
again
surging
up
suddenly
so
hot
and
fierce
that
it
had
control
of
him
almost
before
he
knew
that
it
was
there
how
like
him
too
now
when
things
were
bad
enough
when
he
must
bend
all
his
energies
to
bringing
peace
back
into
the
house
again
he
must
needs
go
and
quarrel
with
the
best
friend
he
had
in
the
world
he
had
never
quarrelled
with
cards
before
never
had
there
been
the
slightest
word
between
them
and
now
he
had
insulted
him
so
that
probably
he
would
never
come
into
their
house
again
and
behind
his
immediate
repentance
at
the
quarrel
there
also
bit
into
his
heart
the
knowledge
that
there
was
truth
in
the
accusation
that
cardillac
had
flung
at
him
he
been
morbid
he
been
selfish
absorbed
by
his
own
grief
at
stephen
loss
he
had
given
no
thought
to
any
one
else
he
had
expected
clare
to
be
like
himself
had
made
no
allowance
for
differences
of
temperament
had
poor
peter
had
never
before
known
an
hour
of
such
miserable
had
he
known
where
to
find
him
he
would
have
gone
that
very
instant
to
beg
pardon
now
in
comparison
with
his
own
black
deeds
rossiter
seemed
an
angel
he
should
show
her
in
the
future
that
he
could
mend
his
ways
clare
should
make
no
further
complaint
of
him
he
found
himself
in
leicester
square
and
still
wrapt
in
his
own
miserable
thoughts
went
into
the
empire
he
walked
up
and
down
the
promenade
wondering
that
so
many
people
could
take
the
world
so
lightly
very
far
away
a
gentleman
in
evening
dress
was
singing
a
song
his
mouth
could
be
seen
to
open
and
shut
sometimes
his
arms
moved
no
sound
could
be
heard
the
promenade
was
packed
up
and
down
ladies
in
enormous
hats
walked
languidly
they
all
wore
clothes
that
were
gorgeous
and
a
little
soiled
they
walked
for
the
most
part
in
couples
and
appeared
to
be
absorbed
in
conversation
but
every
now
and
again
they
smiled
mechanically
recognised
a
friend
or
saw
somebody
who
was
likely
very
shortly
to
become
one
there
was
a
great
deal
of
noise
there
were
numbers
of
men
old
gentlemen
who
were
there
because
they
had
always
been
there
young
gentlemen
who
were
there
because
they
had
never
been
there
before
and
a
few
gentlemen
who
had
come
to
see
the
ballet
the
lights
blazed
the
heat
and
noise
steadily
accumulated
corks
were
popped
in
the
bar
behind
promises
were
broken
in
the
promenade
in
front
and
soon
after
eleven
when
everything
had
become
so
uncomfortable
that
the
very
lights
in
the
building
protested
the
doors
were
opened
and
the
whole
bubble
and
squeak
was
flung
out
into
the
cool
and
starlit
improprieties
of
leicester
square
peter
could
not
have
told
you
if
he
had
been
asked
that
he
had
been
there
felt
a
devouring
thirst
and
entered
a
building
close
at
hand
where
there
were
rows
of
little
round
tables
and
numbers
of
little
round
waiters
peter
sat
down
at
the
first
table
that
occurred
to
him
and
it
was
not
until
he
looked
round
about
him
that
he
discovered
that
a
lady
in
a
huge
black
hat
was
sitting
smiling
opposite
him
her
cheeks
were
rouged
her
gloves
were
soiled
and
her
hair
looked
as
though
it
might
fall
into
a
thousand
pieces
at
the
slightest
provocation
but
her
eyes
were
pathetic
and
tired
they
did
belong
to
her
face
hullo
dear
let
have
a
drink
have
had
a
drink
he
asked
her
what
she
would
like
and
she
told
him
she
studied
him
carefully
for
quite
a
long
time
down
on
your
luck
old
chum
she
said
at
last
yes
i
am
peter
said
a
bit
i
know
i
often
that
way
myself
we
all
catch
it
come
home
and
have
a
bit
of
supper
that
cheer
you
no
thanks
said
peter
politely
i
must
get
back
to
my
own
place
in
a
well
said
the
lady
please
yourself
and
i
have
another
drink
if
you
do
very
much
it
was
whilst
he
was
ordering
another
drink
that
he
came
out
of
his
own
thoughts
and
considered
her
that
right
she
said
smiling
have
a
good
look
my
name
rose
bennett
here
my
card
perhaps
you
like
to
come
and
have
tea
with
me
one
she
gave
him
a
very
dirty
card
on
which
was
written
miss
rose
bennett
annton
street
portland
you
cornish
he
suddenly
said
looking
at
her
she
moved
her
soiled
gloves
up
and
down
the
little
table
well
what
if
i
am
she
said
defiantly
not
looking
at
him
i
knew
it
said
peter
triumphantly
the
way
you
rolled
your
r
well
chuck
it
dear
said
miss
bennett
and
let
talk
sense
cornwall
got
to
do
with
us
anyhow
i
cornish
too
said
peter
it
got
a
good
deal
to
do
with
us
you
need
tell
me
of
course
but
what
part
do
you
come
from
still
sullenly
she
said
almost
forgotten
the
name
of
it
so
long
ago
you
would
know
it
anyway
it
such
a
little
place
they
called
it
portergwarra
i
know
cried
peter
near
the
land
end
of
course
i
know
it
there
are
holes
in
the
rocks
that
they
lift
the
boats
through
there
a
on
the
wall
i
walked
there
many
a
time
well
stow
it
old
man
miss
bennett
answered
decisively
i
not
thinking
of
that
place
any
more
and
i
do
suppose
they
thought
of
me
since
why
it
years
she
broke
off
and
began
hurriedly
to
drink
peter
eyes
sought
her
eyes
his
eyes
were
miserable
and
so
were
hers
but
her
mouth
was
hard
and
laughing
it
funny
talking
of
cornwall
she
said
at
last
no
one
spoken
of
the
place
since
i
came
up
here
but
it
all
right
i
tell
you
quite
all
right
you
take
it
from
me
chucky
i
enjoy
my
life
have
a
jolly
time
there
disadvantages
in
every
profession
and
when
you
got
a
bit
of
a
cold
as
i
have
now
why
she
stopped
her
eyes
sought
peter
he
saw
that
she
was
nearly
crying
talking
of
cornwall
and
all
that
she
muttered
silly
rot
tired
i
going
he
paid
for
the
drinks
and
got
a
hansom
at
that
moment
as
he
stood
looking
over
the
horse
into
the
obscurities
of
the
square
he
thought
with
a
sudden
beating
of
the
heart
that
he
recognised
cardillac
looking
at
him
from
the
doorway
of
a
neighbouring
restaurant
then
the
figure
was
gone
he
had
got
cardillac
on
the
brain
nevertheless
the
suggestion
made
him
suddenly
conscious
of
poor
miss
bennett
enormous
hat
her
rouge
her
soiled
finery
that
allowed
no
question
as
to
her
position
in
the
world
rather
hurriedly
he
asked
her
to
get
into
the
cab
come
that
far
she
said
he
got
in
with
her
and
she
took
off
one
glove
and
he
held
her
hand
and
they
did
speak
all
the
way
when
the
hansom
stopped
at
last
he
got
down
helped
her
out
and
for
a
moment
longer
held
her
hand
we
both
pretty
unhappy
he
said
things
have
been
going
wrong
with
me
too
but
think
of
cornwall
sometimes
and
remember
there
some
one
else
thinking
of
you
a
funny
kid
she
said
looking
at
him
sentimental
i
think
but
it
was
her
eyes
tired
and
regretful
that
said
goodbye
she
let
herself
in
and
the
door
closed
behind
her
he
turned
and
walked
the
streets
it
was
three
before
he
reached
his
home
chapter
xiii
mortimer
stant
i
next
morning
peter
went
round
to
cardillac
flat
and
made
his
apologies
cardillac
accepted
them
at
once
with
the
frankest
expressions
of
friendship
my
dear
old
peter
of
course
he
said
taking
both
peter
hands
in
his
i
was
horribly
blunt
and
unpleasant
about
the
whole
thing
i
did
mean
half
what
i
said
but
the
fact
is
that
you
got
angry
and
then
i
suppose
i
got
angry
and
then
we
both
said
more
than
we
no
said
peter
slowly
for
you
were
quite
right
i
have
been
selfish
and
morbid
i
see
it
all
quite
clearly
i
going
to
be
very
different
now
cards
old
cards
flat
was
splendid
everything
in
it
from
its
grey
ascot
trouserings
kind
of
wall
paper
to
its
beautiful
old
chairs
and
its
beautiful
old
china
was
of
the
very
best
and
cards
himself
in
a
dark
blue
suit
with
a
black
tie
and
a
while
pearl
and
white
spats
on
his
shining
gleaming
shoes
just
ready
to
go
out
and
startle
piccadilly
was
of
the
very
best
he
had
never
peter
thought
looked
so
handsome
at
the
door
cards
put
a
hand
on
peter
shoulder
get
in
late
this
morning
peter
why
said
peter
turning
round
oh
nothing
cards
regarded
him
smiling
i
see
you
at
the
lesters
until
then
old
man
neither
rossiter
nor
clare
made
any
allusion
to
the
quarrel
but
it
had
nevertheless
peter
felt
made
reconciliation
all
the
more
difficult
rossiter
now
seemed
to
imply
in
her
additional
kindnesses
to
cardillac
that
she
felt
for
him
deeply
and
was
sorry
that
he
too
should
have
been
made
to
suffer
under
peter
nature
there
was
even
an
implied
atmosphere
of
alliance
in
the
attitude
of
the
three
to
peter
an
alliance
fostered
and
cemented
by
rossiter
and
spread
by
her
up
and
down
in
and
out
about
the
house
it
was
obvious
indeed
now
that
rossiter
was
never
again
under
any
terms
to
be
won
over
she
had
decided
in
her
own
slow
mind
that
peter
was
an
objectionable
person
that
he
neglected
his
wife
quarrelled
with
his
best
friends
and
refused
to
fulfil
the
career
that
he
had
promised
to
fulfil
she
saw
herself
now
in
the
role
of
protectress
of
her
daughter
and
that
role
she
would
play
to
the
very
end
clare
must
at
all
costs
be
happy
and
in
spite
of
her
odious
husband
happy
she
should
be
peter
discerned
rossiter
state
of
mind
on
the
whole
clearly
enough
but
with
regard
to
clare
he
was
entirely
in
the
dark
he
devoted
his
days
now
to
her
service
he
studied
her
every
want
was
ready
to
abandon
his
work
at
any
moment
to
be
with
her
and
was
careful
also
to
avoid
too
great
a
pestering
of
her
with
attentions
i
know
women
hate
that
he
said
to
himself
if
you
go
down
on
your
knees
to
them
and
hang
around
them
they
simply
ca
stand
it
i
show
her
that
i
and
he
cared
poor
fellow
as
he
had
never
cared
for
her
before
during
their
married
life
the
love
that
he
had
had
for
stephen
he
would
now
give
to
stephen
mother
would
she
but
let
him
but
it
was
a
difficult
business
when
rossiter
was
present
he
could
do
nothing
right
if
he
were
silent
she
would
talk
to
clare
about
people
being
morose
and
what
a
pity
it
was
that
some
people
did
think
of
other
people
a
little
instead
of
being
miserable
about
things
for
which
they
had
nobody
to
thank
but
themselves
and
if
he
tried
to
be
and
amusing
rossiter
bore
with
his
humour
in
so
patient
and
a
spirit
that
his
efforts
failed
lamentably
and
only
made
the
situation
worse
than
it
had
been
before
clare
seemed
to
be
now
entirely
in
her
mother
hands
she
put
her
mother
large
flat
body
between
herself
and
peter
and
through
that
they
were
compelled
to
talk
peter
also
knew
now
that
clare
was
exceedingly
uncomfortable
in
his
presence
it
was
almost
as
though
she
had
something
to
conceal
on
several
occasions
he
had
noticed
that
his
sudden
entrance
into
a
room
had
confused
her
once
he
had
caught
her
hurriedly
pushing
a
letter
out
of
sight
she
was
now
strangely
timid
when
he
was
there
sometimes
with
a
sudden
furious
beating
of
the
heart
he
fancied
that
she
was
coming
back
to
him
again
because
she
would
make
little
half
movements
towards
him
and
then
draw
back
once
he
found
her
crying
the
impulse
to
beg
her
to
confide
in
him
was
almost
stronger
than
he
could
resist
and
yet
he
was
terrified
lest
by
some
sudden
move
he
should
frighten
her
and
drive
her
back
and
so
lose
the
little
ground
that
he
had
gained
the
strangest
thing
of
all
was
that
rossiter
herself
did
not
know
what
clare
trouble
was
she
of
course
put
it
all
down
to
peter
but
she
could
accuse
him
of
nothing
specific
clare
had
not
confided
in
her
did
cards
know
peter
suddenly
asked
himself
with
a
strange
pang
of
jealousy
that
he
should
be
jealous
of
cards
the
most
splendid
most
honourable
fellow
in
the
world
that
of
course
was
absurd
and
yet
they
were
together
so
often
and
it
was
with
jerry
cardillac
alone
that
clare
seemed
now
at
ease
but
peter
put
all
such
thoughts
at
once
away
from
him
had
it
been
any
other
man
but
cards
he
might
have
wondered
but
he
would
trust
cards
alone
with
his
wife
in
the
wilderness
and
know
that
no
ill
could
come
of
it
with
other
women
cards
might
have
few
scruples
peter
had
heard
such
stories
but
with
peter
wife
no
peter
wondered
whether
perhaps
clare
did
not
miss
young
stephen
more
than
they
knew
oh
if
that
were
the
reason
how
he
could
take
her
into
his
arms
and
comfort
her
and
love
her
poor
little
clare
the
time
would
come
when
she
would
show
him
that
she
wanted
him
meanwhile
the
months
passed
the
proofs
of
mortimer
stant
had
been
corrected
and
the
book
was
about
to
appear
to
peter
now
everything
seemed
to
hang
upon
this
event
it
became
with
him
during
the
weeks
before
its
appearance
a
monomania
if
this
book
were
a
success
why
then
dare
and
rossiter
and
all
of
them
would
come
round
to
him
it
was
the
third
book
which
was
always
so
decisive
and
there
was
ground
to
recover
after
the
comparative
failure
of
the
second
novel
as
he
corrected
the
proofs
he
persuaded
himself
that
mortimer
stant
was
after
all
so
bad
it
had
been
ambitious
of
him
of
course
to
write
about
the
emotions
and
experiences
of
a
man
of
forty
and
there
was
perhaps
rather
an
overloaded
and
crude
attempt
at
atmosphere
but
there
was
life
in
the
book
it
had
he
thought
more
swing
in
the
telling
of
it
than
the
other
two
it
is
possible
when
one
is
correcting
proofs
to
persuade
oneself
of
anything
the
book
appeared
and
was
from
the
first
moment
loaded
with
mishap
on
the
day
of
publication
there
was
that
terrible
fire
at
the
casino
theatre
people
talked
of
nothing
else
for
a
fortnight
moreover
by
an
unlucky
chance
young
rondel
novel
the
precipice
was
published
on
the
very
same
day
and
as
the
precipice
was
a
novel
one
and
there
were
no
less
than
three
young
ladies
prepared
to
fall
over
it
at
the
same
moment
it
of
course
commanded
instant
attention
it
was
incidentally
written
with
an
admirable
sense
of
style
and
a
keen
sense
of
character
but
peter
was
now
in
a
fever
that
saw
an
enemy
round
every
corner
the
english
news
supplement
only
gave
him
a
line
stant
a
new
novel
by
the
author
of
hallard
depicting
agreeably
enough
the
amorous
adventures
of
a
stockbroker
of
to
this
had
all
his
fine
dreams
his
moments
of
exultation
his
fevered
inspiration
come
he
searched
the
london
booksellers
but
could
find
no
traces
of
mortimer
stant
at
any
of
them
his
publishers
told
him
that
it
was
only
the
libraries
that
bought
any
fiction
with
the
exception
of
volumes
by
certain
popular
authors
and
yet
he
saw
at
these
booksellers
novels
by
numbers
of
people
who
could
not
lay
claim
to
the
success
that
reuben
hallard
had
secured
for
its
writer
the
reviews
came
in
slowly
and
excepting
for
the
smaller
provincial
papers
treated
him
with
an
indifference
that
was
worse
than
neglect
this
interesting
novel
by
westcott
a
pleasant
tale
of
country
life
by
the
author
of

please
those
who
like
a
quiet
agreeable
book
without
too
much
one
london
weekly
review
a
paper
of
considerable
importance
took
him
severely
to
task
pointed
out
a
number
of
incoherences
of
fact
commented
on
carelessness
of
style
and
finally
advised
westcott
if
he
is
ever
to
write
a
book
of
real
importance
to
work
with
greater
care
and
to
be
less
easily
contented
with
a
superficial
but
worse
than
these
were
the
opinions
of
his
friends
henry
galleon
was
indeed
gone
but
there
were
a
few
launce
alfred
lester
william
trent
alfred
hext
who
had
taken
a
real
and
encouraging
interest
in
him
from
the
beginning
they
took
him
seriously
enough
to
tell
him
the
truth
and
tell
him
the
truth
they
did
dear
launce
who
bear
to
hurt
anybody
and
saw
perhaps
that
he
was
taking
the
book
a
great
deal
more
hardly
than
he
had
taken
the
others
veiled
it
as
well
as
she
could
i
do
think
it
got
splendid
things
in
it
peter
dear
splendid
things
that
bit
about
the
swimming
and
the
character
of
mumps
but
it
does
hang
together
there
a
great
deal
of
repetition
it
as
though
you
written
it
with
your
mind
on
something
else
all
the
and
so
he
had
oh
so
he
had
what
cruel
irony
that
because
his
mind
was
set
to
winning
clare
back
to
him
the
chief
means
for
gaining
her
should
be
ruined
by
his
very
care
for
her
what
to
do
when
all
the
things
of
life
the
bustle
and
hurry
the
marriages
and
births
and
deaths
came
in
between
him
and
his
work
so
that
he
could
scarcely
see
it
so
many
things
obscured
the
way
poor
mortimer
lost
indeed
behind
a
shifting
whirring
cloud
of
real
life
never
to
emerge
poor
man
into
anything
better
than
a
clothes
prop
for
six
weeks
the
book
lingered
in
the
advertisements
a
second
edition
composed
for
the
most
part
of
an
edition
for
america
was
announced
there
were
a
belated
review
or
two
and
then
the
end
the
end
of
two
years
hopes
ambitions
struggles
sweat
and
tears
and
the
end
too
of
how
much
else
from
the
beginning
so
far
back
as
he
could
remember
he
had
believed
that
he
would
one
day
write
great
books
had
believed
it
from
no
conceit
in
him
but
simply
because
he
clung
so
tenaciously
to
ambition
that
it
had
become
again
and
again
almost
realised
in
the
intensity
of
his
dreams
of
it
he
had
known
that
this
achievement
of
his
would
take
a
long
time
that
he
must
meet
with
many
rebuffs
that
he
must
starve
and
despair
and
be
born
again
but
never
at
any
moment
until
now
had
he
in
his
heart
of
hearts
doubted
that
that
great
book
was
in
front
of
him
he
had
seen
his
work
in
his
dreams
derided
flouted
misunderstood
that
was
the
way
with
most
good
work
but
what
he
had
never
seen
was
its
acceptance
amongst
the
ranks
of
the
pretty
good
its
place
given
it
beside
that
rising
and
falling
tide
of
fiction
that
covered
every
year
the
greedy
rocks
of
the
circulating
libraries
and
ebbed
out
again
leaving
no
trace
behind
it
now
after
the
failure
of
mortimer
stant
for
the
first
time
this
awful
question
what
if
after
all
you
should
be
an
ordinary
creature
what
if
you
are
no
better
than
that
army
who
fights
happily
contentedly
with
mediocrity
for
its
daily
bread
and
butter
that
army
upon
whose
serried
ranks
you
have
perhaps
unconsciously
but
nevertheless
with
pity
looked
down
what
if
you
are
never
to
write
a
word
that
will
be
remembered
never
even
to
cause
a
decent
attention
amongst
your
own
generation
what
if
after
all
this
stir
and
fluster
this
pain
and
agony
and
striving
there
should
be
nothing
exceptional
about
peter
what
rock
to
stand
on
then
he
had
never
perhaps
analysed
his
feelings
about
it
all
he
had
certainly
never
thought
himself
an
exceptional
person
but
always
in
his
heart
there
had
been
that
belief
that
one
day
he
would
write
an
exceptional
book
he
was
very
young
not
yet
thirty
but
he
had
had
his
chance
it
seemed
to
him
in
these
weeks
following
the
death
of
mortimer
stant
that
his
career
was
already
over
there
was
also
the
question
of
ways
and
means
just
enough
to
live
on
with
the
reviewing
and
a
column
for
an
american
paper
and
clare
income
but
if
the
books
were
all
of
them
to
fail
as
this
one
had
failed
why
then
it
was
a
dreary
future
for
them
both
in
fact
there
were
now
at
his
feet
pits
of
so
dismal
and
impenetrable
a
blackness
that
he
refused
to
look
down
but
clung
rather
to
his
determination
to
make
all
things
right
with
clare
again
and
then
things
would
come
round
if
that
failed
him
why
then
old
father
in
scaw
house
with
your
drunken
cook
and
your
company
of
ghosts
you
shall
have
your
merry
way
ii
henry
galleon
was
dead
launce
was
unfortunately
during
the
whole
of
this
period
of
peter
career
away
in
the
country
being
burdened
with
work
children
and
he
turned
then
once
again
to
bobby
he
had
seen
very
little
of
bobby
and
alice
galleon
lately
he
was
as
fond
of
bobby
as
he
had
ever
been
but
bobby
had
always
been
a
background
some
one
who
was
there
one
liked
to
think
if
one
wanted
him
but
if
there
was
any
one
more
exciting
then
bobby
vanished
lately
for
quite
a
long
time
now
there
had
been
cardillac
and
somehow
cards
and
bobby
did
not
get
on
together
and
it
was
impossible
to
have
them
both
at
the
same
time
but
now
peter
turned
to
bobby
with
the
eagerness
of
a
return
to
some
comfortable
old
after
the
brilliant
new
furniture
of
a
friend
palace
bobby
was
there
waiting
for
him
it
is
not
to
be
denied
that
the
occasional
nature
of
appearances
had
hurt
them
both
wounded
bobby
and
made
alice
angry
he
given
us
up
bobby
now
that
he
found
so
many
new
friends
i
should
have
expected
him
to
do
that
i
but
bobby
nodded
his
head
the
boy
all
right
he
said
just
trying
to
forget
young
stephen
and
he
forgets
things
better
in
cardillac
company
than
he
does
in
mine
i
not
lively
enough
for
that
kind
of
thing
he
come
back
but
at
the
same
time
bobby
was
anxious
things
were
wrong
up
there
at
the
roundabout
very
wrong
he
knew
clare
and
cards
and
peter
and
rossiter
in
all
probability
better
than
any
one
alive
knew
them
and
he
was
no
fool
then
peter
came
back
to
him
and
was
received
as
though
he
had
never
left
him
and
alice
who
had
intended
to
tell
peter
what
she
thought
of
his
disloyalty
had
no
word
to
say
when
she
saw
his
white
drawn
face
and
his
tired
eyes
there
something
awfully
wrong
up
there
said
alice
to
bobby
that
night
bobby
look
after
but
bobby
who
had
heard
by
that
time
what
peter
had
to
say
shut
his
mouth
tight
then
at
last
our
friend
cardillac
has
a
good
deal
to
answer
for
and
left
alice
to
make
what
she
could
out
of
it
meanwhile
up
in
bobby
dusty
old
room
called
by
courtesy
the
study
but
having
little
evidence
of
literature
about
it
save
an
edition
of
and
a
miscellaneous
collection
of
peter
had
poured
out
his
soul
bobby
i
feel
as
though
i
just
been
set
up
with
my
back
against
the
wall
for
every
one
to
make
shies
at
everything
going
wrong
everything
the
ground
crumbling
from
under
my
feet
first
it
young
stephen
then
it
clare
then
my
book
fails
do
humbug
you
know
it
an
utter
failure
then
i
quarrel
with
cards
then
that
damned
woman
he
stopped
at
the
thought
of
rossiter
and
drove
his
hands
together
then
he
went
on
more
quietly
it
like
fighting
in
a
fog
bobby
there
the
thing
i
want
somewhere
just
beside
me
i
want
clare
clare
as
she
used
to
be
when
we
were
first
married
but
i
ca
get
at
her
and
yet
through
it
all
i
do
know
what
it
is
that
stops
me
i
know
i
had
thought
of
her
enough
with
the
book
and
stephen
and
everything
cards
told
me
that
pretty
straight
but
now
i
seen
all
that
and
i
ready
to
do
anything
anything
if
she
only
love
me
go
directly
to
her
and
tell
her
said
bobby
have
it
all
out
in
the
open
with
that
just
it
peter
answered
i
never
seem
to
get
her
alone
there
always
either
her
mother
or
cards
there
cards
sees
her
alone
much
more
than
i
do
but
of
course
she
likes
his
company
better
than
mine
just
now
i
such
a
gloomy
beggar
nonsense
said
bobby
roughly
you
believe
anything
that
any
one
tells
you
they
tell
you
that
you
gloomy
and
depressing
and
so
you
think
you
are
they
did
find
you
gloomy
at
brockett
did
they
and
alice
and
i
have
never
found
you
depressing
do
listen
to
that
woman
clare
always
been
under
her
influence
and
it
for
you
to
take
her
out
of
it
not
to
lie
down
quietly
and
say
she
too
much
for
you
but
there
another
thing
he
added
slowly
and
awkwardly
after
a
pause
what
that
asked
peter
well
cards
said
bobby
at
last
oh
i
know
you
say
i
hate
him
but
i
do
i
do
hate
him
i
always
known
him
for
what
he
was
in
those
days
at
dawson
when
if
you
flattered
him
he
was
kind
and
if
you
did
he
was
contemptuous
at
cambridge
it
was
the
same
there
was
only
one
fellow
there
i
ever
saw
him
knock
under
to
a
man
called
dune
and
he
was
out
and
away
exceptional
anyhow
at
games
and
work
and
everything
now
made
cards
into
a
decent
fellow
for
the
time
being
and
if
he
had
the
running
of
him
he
might
have
turned
all
that
brilliance
into
something
worth
having
but
he
vanished
and
cards
has
never
owned
his
master
since
everything
was
there
ready
in
him
to
be
turned
one
way
or
the
other
and
after
he
left
cambridge
there
was
his
silly
mother
and
a
sillier
london
waiting
to
finish
him
now
he
nothing
but
vanity
and
fascination
and
soon
there
be
nothing
but
you
unjust
to
him
bobby
you
always
have
been
well
perhaps
i
am
he
always
treated
me
with
such
undisguised
contempt
that
it
only
human
that
i
should
be
a
little
prejudiced
but
that
neither
here
nor
there
what
is
the
point
peter
is
that
too
much
up
at
your
place
too
much
for
his
own
good
too
much
for
yours
and
too
much
for
bobby
oh
yes
i
know
i
saying
a
serious
thing
but
you
asked
me
for
my
advice
and
i
give
it
i
do
say
that
cards
means
any
harm
but
people
will
talk
and
it
would
do
you
any
damage
in
clare
eyes
either
peter
if
you
were
to
stand
up
to
him
a
peter
smiled
dear
old
bobby
if
any
one
else
in
the
world
had
said
such
a
thing
of
course
i
should
have
been
most
awfully
angry
but
always
known
how
unfair
you
were
about
cards
you
never
liked
him
even
in
the
dawson
days
you
just
do
suit
one
another
but
i
tell
you
bobby
that
i
trust
cards
more
than
i
trust
any
one
in
the
world
of
course
clare
likes
to
be
with
him
and
of
course
he
likes
to
be
with
her
they
suit
one
another
exactly
why
he
splendid
the
other
day
when
i
been
a
perfect
beast
losing
my
temper
like
a
boy
of
ten
you
should
have
heard
the
way
he
took
it
one
day
bobby
you
see
how
splendid
he
bobby
said
no
more
peter
went
on
again
no
it
my
done
the
damage
you
right
the
thing
to
do
is
to
get
clare
alone
and
have
it
right
out
with
her
we
clear
the
mists
bobby
said
you
know
peter
both
alice
and
i
would
do
anything
in
the
world
to
make
you
happy
peter
gripped
his
hand
i
know
you
would
if
i
could
forget
young
stephen
he
caught
his
breath
bobby
i
see
him
everywhere
all
the
time
i
lie
awake
hours
at
night
thinking
about
him
i
see
him
in
my
sleep
see
him
sometimes
splendid
famous
sometimes
i
think
he
comes
back
i
can
see
him
lying
on
his
back
and
looking
up
at
the
ceiling
and
i
say
to
myself
if
you
do
move
he
stay
there
and
then
i
move
and
he
gone
and
i
have
any
one
to
talk
about
him
to
i
never
know
whether
clare
thinks
of
him
or
not
he
was
so
splendid
bobby
so
strong
and
he
loved
me
in
the
most
extraordinary
way
we
have
been
tremendous
pals
if
he
lived
i
could
have
stood
anything
if
i
been
able
to
see
him
growing
up
had
him
to
care
about
i
so
lonely
bobby
and
if
i
do
make
clare
come
back
to
me
now
that
the
book
failed
i
i
i
go
back
to
scaw
house
and
just
drink
myself
to
the
devil
there
with
my
old
father
be
glad
you
once
told
me
bobby
said
about
an
old
man
in
your
place
when
you
were
a
kid
who
said
once
is
life
that
matters
but
the
courage
you
bring
to
it
well
that
what
you
proving
now
yes
but
why
me
i
had
a
bad
time
all
my
life
always
been
knocked
about
and
cursed
and
kicked
why
should
it
go
on
all
the
time
all
the
time
because
they
think
you
worth
it
i
suppose
said
bobby
iii
and
the
result
of
that
conversation
was
that
on
that
very
night
peter
made
his
appeal
they
had
had
a
silent
evening
rossiter
was
staying
in
the
house
at
this
time
and
at
last
they
all
had
gone
up
to
bed
peter
stayed
for
a
moment
in
his
seeing
his
white
face
in
the
hearing
the
beating
of
his
heart
and
then
with
a
hand
that
strangely
trembled
knocked
on
clare
door
her
voice
sounded
frightened
he
thought
as
she
called
to
him
to
come
in
indeed
as
he
entered
she
folded
a
letter
that
she
had
been
reading
and
put
it
in
a
drawer
in
the
at
which
she
was
sitting
it
was
only
seldom
now
that
he
disturbed
her
in
that
room
she
had
turned
on
the
electric
light
over
her
the
rest
of
the
room
was
in
darkness
she
seemed
to
peter
very
fragile
and
tiny
as
she
sat
there
in
her
black
evening
frock
her
breast
rising
and
falling
as
though
something
had
suddenly
frightened
her
her
eyes
wide
and
startled
he
felt
a
gross
coarse
brute
as
he
stumbled
coming
across
the
dark
floor
to
her
my
god
he
cried
in
his
heart
put
everything
right
now
let
this
make
everything
his
big
square
body
flung
huge
fantastic
shadows
upon
the
wall
but
he
looked
as
he
faced
her
like
a
boy
who
had
come
to
his
master
to
confess
some
crime
apparently
she
was
reassured
now
for
she
took
off
her
necklace
and
moved
about
the
things
on
her
table
as
though
to
show
him
that
she
was
on
the
point
of
undressing
well
peter
what
is
it
she
said
i
come
clare
just
a
moment
i
want
a
but
it
late
i
tired
wo
some
other
time
do
no
i
want
it
what
is
it
she
was
looking
into
the
glass
as
she
spoke
to
him
he
pulled
a
little
chair
over
to
her
and
sat
forward
so
that
his
knees
nearly
touched
her
thin
black
dress
he
put
out
his
big
hand
and
caught
one
of
her
little
ones
he
thought
for
a
moment
that
she
was
going
to
resist
then
it
lay
there
cold
as
ice
clare
darling
look
here
everything
been
wrong
with
both
of
us
for
ages
and
i
come
i
come
because
i
know
it
been
very
largely
my
fault
and
i
come
to
say
that
everything
will
be
different
now
and
i
want
you
to
let
things
be
as
they
were
before
for
a
moment
he
fancied
that
he
saw
a
light
leap
into
her
eyes
he
felt
her
hand
tremble
for
a
moment
in
his
then
the
expression
was
gone
how
do
you
mean
she
said
still
looking
into
the
glass
what
do
you
mean
peter
i
have
noticed
anything
oh
yes
you
have
you
know
that
ever
since
stephen
died
and
before
that
really
you
avoided
me
you
rather
be
without
me
than
with
me
you
all
thought
me
selfish
and
glum
and
so
i
suppose
i
was
but
i
missed
the
kid
a
again
peter
felt
her
hand
tremble
he
pressed
it
then
he
went
on
leaning
more
toward
her
now
and
putting
an
arm
out
to
touch
her
dress
clare
it
been
like
a
fog
all
these
weeks
we
never
had
it
out
we
never
talked
about
it
but
you
been
disappointed
in
me
you
thought
i
was
going
to
write
great
books
and
i
have
and
then
your
mother
and
i
do
get
on
and
then
i
suppose
i
stupid
in
society
i
ca
talk
a
lot
to
any
one
who
comes
along
as
all
you
people
can
been
brought
up
differently
and
and
i
know
you
do
like
to
think
about
that
either
and
so
i
never
bring
my
old
friends
into
the
house
and
i
see
that
i
not
such
a
gawk
at
your
parties
he
paused
for
a
moment
she
was
looking
down
now
and
he
could
see
her
eyes
he
bent
forward
more
closely
his
arm
caught
her
waist
his
hand
crushed
hers
she
tried
desperately
to
pull
herself
together
to
say
something
no
there
nothing
well
if
there
is
of
course
i
suppose
it
happens
to
all
married
people
what
happens
why
they
find
one
another
out
a
little
things
are
quite
as
they
thought
they
be
that
must
happen
but
tell
me
tell
me
the
things
in
me
that
have
disappointed
you
and
then
i
can
alter
well
it
a
little
as
you
say
you
have
been
rather
rude
to
mother
and
then
your
quarrel
what
you
mean
with
cards
with
jerry
yes
and
then
her
voice
was
high
and
sharp
now
her
eyes
avoided
his
i
always
been
happy
until
married
things
frighten
me
you
do
understand
me
peter
how
easily
frightened
you
never
seemed
to
see
that
other
people
i
been
selfish
i
yes
she
went
on
still
in
that
high
voice
and
you
never
consider
me
in
little
things
and
you
laugh
at
me
as
though
i
were
stupid
i
suppose
it
all
your
fault
you
were
brought
up
roughly
but
you
rough
you
hurt
me
often
i
ca
bear
her
lip
was
trembling
and
she
was
nearly
crying
i
ca
bear
being
unhappy
my
god
cried
peter
what
a
beast
i
am
what
a
brute
i
been
yes
and
you
never
seemed
to
think
that
i
minded
poor
little
death
the
dear
little
thing
of
course
it
hurt
me
dreadfully
and
you
never
thought
of
it
all
going
to
be
different
now
love
me
clare
love
me
and
it
will
all
come
back
and
then
if
you
only
love
me
i
be
able
to
write
the
most
wonderful
books
i
be
famous
all
the
world
over
if
you
only
love
me
clare
darling
he
dropt
on
to
his
knees
before
her
and
looking
up
at
her
whispered
clare
darling
darling
you
all
that
i
got
now
everything
in
the
world
and
in
return
i
try
to
be
everything
to
you
i
spend
my
life
in
making
you
happy
i
care
for
only
one
thing
and
that
is
to
be
your
servant
clare
clare
she
gave
a
little
protesting
cry
peter
peter
do
i
i
ca
and
then
in
a
shuddering
whisper
peter
i
not
good
enough
i
love
you
now
i
ca
but
he
had
caught
her
was
holding
her
to
him
now
with
both
his
arms
round
her
pressing
her
against
his
shirt
hurting
her
at
last
covering
her
mouth
her
eyes
her
cheeks
with
kisses
he
had
not
heard
those
words
now
in
the
triumph
of
having
her
back
again
his
as
she
had
been
on
the
first
day
of
their
marriage
did
not
feel
her
body
unresponsive
her
hands
cold
nor
did
he
see
the
appeal
wild
and
desperate
in
her
eyes
at
last
he
left
her
closing
softly
her
door
between
them
chapter
xiv
peter
buys
a
present
i
peter
did
not
hesitate
now
he
should
win
clare
back
with
his
strong
right
hand
and
he
would
rule
the
roundabout
with
a
rod
of
iron
ruling
the
roundabout
meant
ruling
rossiter
and
he
was
surprised
at
the
ease
with
which
he
won
his
victory
over
that
lady
had
he
considered
it
more
deeply
that
easy
victory
might
have
seemed
to
him
ominous
at
luncheon
on
the
day
after
his
talk
with
clare
they
three
sat
together
rossiter
silent
clare
silent
peter
silent
suddenly
peter
said
oh
by
the
way
clare
i
telephoned
for
seats
this
morning
for
the
new
thing
at
the
criterion
i
got
two
they
had
not
been
to
the
theatre
together
since
stephen
death
clare
lifted
a
white
face
i
do
think
i
oh
yes
said
peter
smiling
across
at
her
you
enjoy
rossiter
stroking
her
large
bosom
with
a
flat
white
hand
said
i
do
think
clare
oh
yes
said
peter
again
it
will
do
her
rossiter
smiled
get
another
stall
peter
and
i
will
come
i
afraid
said
peter
very
politely
that
it
too
late
the
piece
is
a
thumping
success
i
was
very
lucky
to
get
any
seats
at
and
then
rossiter
subsided
absolutely
subsided
very
strange
that
was
not
a
very
happy
evening
clare
scarcely
spoke
she
answered
him
with
yes
and
no
she
sat
in
the
stalls
looking
like
a
little
unhappy
ghost
she
did
not
in
any
way
repulse
him
she
let
him
take
her
hand
coming
home
in
the
cab
she
shivered
and
he
asked
whether
she
were
cold
and
she
said
yes
she
thought
that
she
was
that
night
he
came
in
took
her
for
a
moment
in
his
hands
kissed
her
very
gently
on
the
lips
and
said
clare
you
not
angry
with
me
for
last
night
no
she
answered
him
then
she
added
slowly
as
though
she
were
repeating
a
part
that
she
learnt
thank
you
for
taking
me
to
the
play
peter
i
was
rather
tired
but
thank
you
for
taking
he
went
to
bed
thanking
god
for
this
change
in
her
i
make
her
love
me
just
as
she
used
to
those
days
on
our
honeymoon
god
bless
yes
rossiter
was
strangely
altered
it
all
shows
what
one
can
do
with
a
woman
when
one
tries
her
hostile
placidity
had
given
place
to
something
almost
pathetic
one
would
have
thought
had
one
not
known
that
lady
invariable
assurance
of
movement
that
she
was
perplexed
almost
distressed
peter
was
conscious
that
clare
was
now
as
silent
with
her
mother
as
she
was
with
him
he
perceived
that
rossiter
was
disturbed
at
reticence
he
fancied
that
he
sometimes
interrupted
little
conversations
between
the
mother
and
the
daughter
the
intention
of
which
was
on
rossiter
part
at
any
rate
that
clare
should
tell
her
there
was
no
doubt
at
all
that
rossiter
was
anxious
even
although
this
seemed
impossible
she
appeared
to
be
ready
to
accept
peter
as
a
friend
and
ally
now
now
after
these
many
weeks
of
hostility
surely
women
are
strange
creatures
in
any
case
one
may
observe
the
yellow
brooch
agitated
now
and
ill
at
ease
very
soon
too
cards
came
to
make
his
farewells
he
was
going
to
paris
for
the
whole
of
may
what
wo
you
be
back
for
the
beginning
of
the
season
cried
peter
astonished
no
cards
answered
laughing
for
once
the
season
can
commence
without
he
was
especially
affectionate
but
seemed
anxious
to
be
gone
his
dark
eyes
avoided
peter
gaze
he
did
look
well
a
little
anxious
and
cards
was
generally
the
soul
of
carelessness
what
a
splendid
fellow
he
was
peter
looked
him
up
and
down
taking
that
same
delight
that
he
had
always
taken
in
his
distinction
his
good
looks
his
ease
he
ought
to
have
been
born
king
of
somewhere
peter
used
to
think
he
ought
really
no
wonder
people
spoil
there
another
thing
peter
said
you
forgetting
clare
birthday
next
week
she
be
dreadfully
disappointed
at
your
not
being
here
for
i
have
to
remember
it
from
paris
cards
said
well
it
an
awful
pity
that
you
going
for
a
whole
month
i
know
what
we
shall
do
without
you
and
you
cheer
clare
up
she
rather
depressed
just
now
thinks
of
the
kid
a
bit
i
well
i
write
said
cards
and
was
gone
ii
peter
received
at
this
time
a
letter
that
showed
him
that
he
had
at
any
rate
one
friend
in
the
world
who
believed
in
him
it
was
from
james
maradick
and
it
was
strangely
encouraging
now
at
this
period
of
yawning
pits
from
whose
blackness
he
so
resolutely
turned
away
it
asked
him
to
go
with
maradick
as
his
guest
to
some
club
dinner
then
it
went
on
you
know
westcott
we
do
meet
as
often
as
we
should
like
ships
in
the
night
we
signal
every
now
and
again
and
then
pass
but
i
am
quite
sure
that
we
have
plenty
to
say
to
one
another
once
or
twice
you
remember
that
party
when
i
gassed
about
cornwall
we
have
nearly
said
it
but
something
has
always
prevented
i
remember
that
you
divided
the
world
once
in
a
fit
of
youthful
confidence
into
explorers
and
well
those
words
will
do
as
well
as
any
others
to
describe
the
great
dividing
line
at
any
rate
you
an
explorer
and
you
trying
to
get
on
terms
with
the
and
i
a
and
i
trying
to
get
on
terms
with
the
explorers
and
that
why
we
both
so
uncomfortable
the
only
happy
people
take
my
word
for
it
are
those
who
know
the
kind
of
thing
they
are
explorers
or
and
just
stick
at
that
and
shut
their
eyes
tight
to
the
other
kind
of
people
that
other
world
those
are
the
happy
people
and
after
all
most
people
are
like
that
but
we
you
and
i
are
uncomfortably
conscious
of
the
other
party
want
to
know
them
in
fact
want
them
to
receive
us
well
i
getting
on
and
it
late
days
for
me
but
you
got
all
your
life
before
you
and
will
do
great
things
take
my
word
for
it
only
do
be
discouraged
because
the
do
come
to
you
all
at
once
give
time
they
come
this
seemed
to
peter
at
this
moment
of
a
whole
welter
of
doubt
and
confusion
and
misunderstanding
of
people
motives
and
positions
to
explain
a
great
deal
was
that
the
reason
why
he
been
so
happy
in
old
zachary
tan
shop
years
ago
why
he
been
happy
through
all
that
existence
at
the
bookshop
those
absurd
unreal
conspirators
happy
yes
even
when
starving
with
stephen
in
bucket
lane
he
was
then
in
his
right
company
explorers
one
and
all
whereas
here
now
had
he
ever
been
happy
at
the
roundabout
except
during
the
first
year
and
afterwards
when
stephen
came
and
was
not
that
too
the
explanation
of
young
stephen
happiness
upon
the
arrival
of
zanti
and
brant
did
he
not
recognise
them
for
what
they
were
explorers
he
being
a
young
explorer
himself
on
the
other
side
rossiter
clare
cards
old
bobby
who
in
spite
of
his
affection
never
understood
half
the
things
that
peter
did
or
said
the
galleons
old
galleon
and
percival
and
his
sister
had
henry
galleon
known
that
and
suffered
under
it
all
his
life
and
borne
it
and
perhaps
conquered
it
and
peter
suddenly
standing
at
his
window
watching
london
caught
by
the
evening
light
saw
for
an
instant
his
work
in
front
of
him
again
london
with
her
towers
her
roofs
and
chimneys
smoke
and
mist
and
haze
weaving
a
web
and
then
beneath
it
humming
buzzing
turning
all
the
lives
all
the
comedies
all
the
tragedies
kings
and
princes
guttersnipes
and
duchesses
politicians
and
newsboys
criminals
and
saints
waiting
that
golden
top
for
some
hand
to
set
it
humming
in
that
moment
peter
westcott
aged
with
a
book
just
behind
him
that
had
been
counted
on
every
side
the
most
dismal
of
failures
saw
himself
the
english
balzac
saw
london
open
like
a
book
at
his
feet
saw
heaven
and
all
its
glories
himself
the
one
and
only
begetter
of
a
thousand
masterpieces
but
the
sun
set
the
towers
and
roofs
and
chimneys
were
coldly
grey
a
ragged
wind
rose
through
the
branches
of
the
orchard
dark
clouds
hid
the
risen
moon
newsboys
were
crying
a
murder
in
whitechapel
i
hate
this
house
peter
said
turning
away
from
the
window
into
a
room
crowded
now
with
dusk
iii
it
was
the
first
of
may
and
the
day
before
clare
birthday
it
was
one
of
the
most
beautiful
days
of
the
year
with
a
hint
of
summer
in
its
light
and
shadow
a
shimmer
of
golden
sun
shaking
through
the
trees
in
the
orchard
flung
from
there
on
to
the
windows
of
the
roundabout
to
dance
in
twisting
lines
along
the
floors
and
across
the
walls
all
doors
and
windows
seemed
to
be
open
the
scent
of
flowers
a
prophecy
of
pinks
and
roses
where
as
yet
there
were
none
flooded
the
little
chelsea
streets
the
velasquez
on
the
walls
of
the
roundabout
danced
in
her
stiff
skirts
looking
down
upon
a
room
bathed
in
green
and
gold
shadow
it
was
three
in
the
afternoon
and
peter
was
going
out
to
buy
clare
a
present
he
had
seen
a
ruby
pendant
many
months
ago
in
a
window
in
bond
street
he
had
thought
of
it
for
clare
but
he
had
known
that
with
young
stephen
education
and
the
rest
of
the
kid
expenses
he
could
not
dare
to
afford
it
now
things
were
different
it
should
sign
and
seal
this
new
order
he
came
downstairs
he
looked
into
the
little
clare
was
standing
there
by
the
window
looking
at
the
gay
trees
in
the
orchard
on
the
opposite
wall
the
velasquez
danced
she
had
not
heard
him
come
in
and
she
was
standing
by
the
window
with
her
hands
clasped
tightly
behind
her
her
body
strung
up
so
it
seemed
by
some
height
of
determination
she
wore
a
black
dress
with
a
little
white
round
her
neck
and
at
the
sleeves
her
hair
was
rolled
into
a
pile
on
the
top
of
her
head
and
the
sunlight
from
the
orchard
was
shining
upon
it
when
peter
called
her
name
she
turned
round
with
a
startled
cry
and
put
her
hand
to
her
throat
then
she
moved
back
against
the
window
as
though
she
were
afraid
that
he
was
going
to
touch
her
he
noticed
her
movement
and
the
words
that
he
had
intended
to
say
were
checked
on
his
lips
he
stammered
instead
something
about
going
out
she
nodded
her
head
she
had
pulled
herself
together
and
walked
towards
him
from
the
window
wo
you
come
too
it
is
such
a
lovely
day
he
asked
her
i
got
a
it
do
your
headache
but
she
shook
her
head
no
i
going
upstairs
to
lie
she
moved
past
him
to
the
door
then
with
her
hand
on
it
she
turned
back
to
him
peter
i
she
said
she
seemed
to
appeal
to
him
with
her
eyes
beseeching
trying
to
say
something
but
the
rest
of
her
face
was
dumb
the
appeal
the
things
that
she
would
have
said
suddenly
died
leaving
her
face
utterly
without
expression
bobby
and
mother
are
coming
to
dinner
are
they
yes
she
passed
through
the
door
across
the
sunlit
hall
up
the
dark
stairs
she
walked
with
that
hesitating
halting
step
that
he
knew
so
well
her
small
white
hand
lay
for
a
moment
on
the
banisters
then
she
had
disappeared
iv
coming
through
the
hall
peter
noticed
that
there
was
a
letter
in
the
box
he
took
it
out
and
found
with
delight
that
it
was
from
stephen
brant
he
had
had
no
word
from
him
since
the
day
when
he
and
zanti
had
paid
their
fateful
visit
the
letter
said
peter
this
is
a
hurried
line
to
tell
you
that
he
is
dead
at
last
died
in
drink
cursing
and
swearing
and
now
her
mother
and
she
poor
dear
are
going
to
america
and
i
going
to
look
after
her
hoping
that
we
be
marrying
in
a
few
months
time
and
so
realise
my
heart
wish
dear
peter
i
sail
on
thursday
from
southampton
and
would
be
coming
to
see
you
but
would
not
like
to
inconvenience
you
as
you
now
are
but
my
heart
is
ever
the
same
to
you
dear
boy
and
the
day
will
come
when
we
can
talk
over
old
times
once
again
your
affectionate
friend
sir
now
about
to
be
made
the
happiest
man
in
all
the
world
stephen
i
hope
the
little
kid
is
strong
and
happy
zanti
goes
with
us
to
america
having
heard
of
gold
in
california
and
is
to
be
my
best
man
when
the
day
so
stephen
long
wait
was
ended
at
last
peter
eyes
were
dimmed
as
he
put
the
letter
away
in
his
pocket
what
a
selfish
beast
to
be
sure
must
this
same
peter
westcott
be
for
here
he
was
wishing
yes
almost
wishing
that
stephen
happiness
had
not
come
to
him
always
at
the
back
of
everything
there
had
been
the
thought
of
stephen
brant
let
all
the
pits
in
the
world
gape
and
yawn
there
was
one
person
in
the
world
to
whom
peter
was
precious
now
in
america
with
a
wife
some
of
the
sunlight
had
gone
out
of
the
air
and
peter
heart
was
suddenly
cold
with
that
old
dread
another
friend
taken
from
him
another
link
gone
then
he
pulled
himself
together
tried
to
rejoice
with
stephen
at
his
happiness
failed
dismally
walked
down
piccadilly
defiantly
with
swinging
shoulders
and
a
frowning
face
like
a
sailor
in
a
hostile
country
and
went
into
the
bond
street
jeweller
he
had
been
there
on
several
former
occasions
and
a
large
stout
man
who
looked
as
though
he
must
have
been
lord
mayor
several
years
running
came
forward
and
gave
peter
an
audience
precious
stones
were
of
no
account
in
such
a
place
as
this
and
the
ruby
pendant
looked
quite
small
and
humble
when
it
was
brought
to
peter
nevertheless
it
was
beautiful
and
would
suit
clare
exactly
it
seemed
to
appeal
personally
to
peter
as
though
it
knew
that
he
wanted
it
for
a
very
especial
occasion
this
was
one
of
those
persons
who
would
come
in
and
buy
you
as
though
you
were
dirt
it
meant
something
to
peter
it
meant
something
indeed
it
meant
exactly
sixty
pounds
is
that
rather
a
lot
said
peter
it
as
fine
a
ruby
said
the
dignitary
looking
over
peter
head
out
of
the
window
as
though
he
were
tired
of
the
affair
and
wanted
to
see
whether
his
car
were
there
i
take
it
said
peter
desperately
sixty
pounds
did
one
ever
hear
of
such
a
thing
sixty
pounds
never
mind
it
marked
an
occasion
the
ruby
smiled
at
peter
as
it
was
slipped
into
its
case
it
was
glad
that
it
was
going
to
somebody
who
had
very
many
things
he
had
several
other
matters
to
settle
and
it
was
nearly
five
when
he
turned
out
of
knightsbridge
down
sloane
street
the
sun
was
slipping
behind
the
hyde
park
hotel
so
that
already
the
shadows
were
lying
along
the
lower
parts
of
the
houses
although
the
roofs
were
bright
with
sunshine
it
was
the
hour
when
all
the
dogs
were
taken
for
the
last
exercise
of
the
day
every
kind
of
dog
was
there
but
especially
the
fat
and
pampered
variety
poms
king
charles
pekinese
dachshunds
a
few
bigger
dogs
and
even
one
dane
who
walked
with
melancholy
superiority
as
a
king
amongst
his
vassals
the
street
stirred
with
the
patterings
of
dogs
the
light
slid
down
the
sky
voices
rang
in
the
clear
air
softly
as
though
the
dying
day
had
besought
them
to
be
tender
the
colours
of
the
shops
of
the
green
trees
of
slim
and
houses
were
powdered
with
the
church
in
sloane
square
began
to
ring
its
bells
peter
as
he
turned
down
the
street
was
cold
perhaps
because
knightsbridge
had
been
blazing
with
sunshine
and
the
light
here
was
hidden
no
it
was
more
than
that
they
say
he
thought
that
cornishmen
always
know
when
a
coming
if
that
true
something
ought
to
be
going
to
happen
to
and
then
in
a
flash
that
sound
that
he
had
been
expecting
came
the
sound
of
the
sea
he
could
hear
it
quite
distinctly
a
distant
movement
that
seemed
so
vast
in
its
roll
and
plunge
so
sharp
in
the
shock
with
which
it
met
the
shore
and
yet
so
subdued
that
it
might
be
many
thousands
of
miles
away
it
was
as
though
a
vast
tide
were
dragging
back
a
million
shells
from
an
endless
shore
the
dragging
hiss
the
hesitating
suspense
in
and
then
the
rattle
of
the
returning
wave
as
though
hypnotised
he
closed
his
eyes
yes
he
was
walking
along
the
sea
road
there
was
that
range
of
rock
that
lay
out
at
sea
like
a
crouching
dog
there
was
that
white
twisting
circle
of
foam
that
lay
about
the
ragged
stone
out
there
by
itself
the
rock
with
the
melancholy
bell
then
through
the
plunging
sea
he
could
hear
its
note
the
moan
of
some
one
in
pain
and
ever
that
rattle
that
hiss
that
suspense
that
crash
i
beg
your
pardon
he
had
run
into
a
lady
maid
who
was
leading
a
pompous
king
charles
the
spaniel
eyed
him
with
hatred
the
maid
with
distrust
he
passed
on
but
the
sea
had
departed
to
chase
away
his
gathering
depression
he
thought
that
he
would
go
in
and
have
tea
with
bobby
and
alice
it
was
quite
late
when
he
got
there
and
stars
were
in
a
sky
that
was
so
delicate
in
colour
that
it
seemed
as
though
it
were
exhausted
by
the
glorious
day
that
it
had
had
a
little
sickle
moon
was
poised
above
the
chelsea
trees
to
his
disgust
he
found
that
percival
and
millicent
galleon
were
having
tea
with
their
brother
their
reception
of
him
very
quickly
showed
him
that
mortimer
stant
had
put
a
final
end
to
any
hopes
that
they
might
have
had
of
his
career
as
an
artist
how
the
book
doing
westcott
said
percival
looking
upon
clothes
broad
shoulders
and
shoes
with
evident
contempt
not
very
well
thank
you
ah
well
it
did
quite
come
off
did
it
westcott
not
quite
hit
the
nail
every
time
now
young
rondel
in
this
precipice
of
his
has
done
some
splendid
work
we
had
him
to
tea
the
other
day
and
really
he
seemed
quite
a
nice
unassuming
fellow
oh
shut
up
bobby
growled
you
talk
too
much
peter
was
growing
quite
a
short
time
ago
he
would
have
been
furious
would
have
gone
into
his
shell
refused
to
speak
to
anybody
been
depressed
and
glowering
now
smiling
he
said
alice
wo
you
consider
it
and
come
up
and
dine
with
us
after
all
it
only
my
beside
ourselves
no
thanks
peter
i
must
the
boy
not
quite
the
well
all
right
if
you
nevertheless
it
hurt
although
it
was
only
that
young
ass
of
a
galleon
that
though
was
one
of
the
pits
into
which
one
must
not
look
he
felt
the
little
square
box
that
contained
the
ruby
lying
there
so
snugly
in
his
pocket
that
cheered
him
i
must
be
getting
back
everybody
see
you
at
dinner
he
went
after
percival
and
his
sister
had
also
gone
alice
said
dear
peter
growing
yes
said
bobby
my
sweet
young
brother
wants
the
most
beautiful
kicking
and
he
get
it
very
then
he
looked
at
the
clock
i
must
go
up
and
i
rather
glad
said
alice
i
not
coming
clare
gets
considerably
on
my
nerves
just
at
yes
said
bobby
but
thank
god
cardillac
in
paris
for
the
time
then
he
added
reflectively
dear
old
peter
bless
him
chapter
xv
westcott
senior
calls
checkmate
i
peter
felt
as
he
closed
the
hall
door
behind
him
that
the
roundabout
was
both
cold
and
dark
the
little
hall
drew
dusk
into
its
corners
very
swiftly
and
now
as
he
switched
on
the
electric
light
he
was
conscious
almost
of
protest
on
the
part
of
the
place
as
though
it
wished
that
it
might
have
been
left
to
its
empty
dusk
a
maid
passed
him
has
your
mistress
gone
upstairs
he
asked
her
i
do
think
she
has
come
in
not
come
in
no
sir
she
went
out
about
three
i
do
think
she
come
back
she
running
it
pretty
close
he
thought
as
he
looked
at
his
watch
then
he
went
slowly
up
to
dress
he
had
been
more
irritated
by
the
superiorities
of
young
percival
galleon
than
he
had
cared
to
confess
peter
had
at
the
bottom
of
his
soul
a
most
real
and
even
touching
humility
he
had
no
kind
of
opinion
of
his
abilities
of
his
work
in
comparison
with
the
other
workers
that
counted
moreover
he
would
not
were
his
ultimate
critical
sense
aroused
fail
to
admit
to
himself
some
certain
standard
of
achievement
nothing
that
young
galleon
could
say
mattered
from
the
critical
standpoint
nevertheless
he
seemed
to
represent
in
this
case
a
universal
opinion
even
in
his
rejection
of
peter
one
could
see
behind
him
a
world
of
readers
withdrawing
their
approval
peter
westcott
no
good
peter
westcott
no
good
peter
westcott
no
good
in
any
case
that
was
quite
enough
to
account
for
the
oppression
that
he
was
feeling
feeling
with
increasing
force
as
the
minutes
passed
he
undressed
and
dressed
again
slowly
wondering
vaguely
loosely
in
the
back
of
his
mind
why
it
was
that
clare
had
not
come
in
perhaps
she
had
come
in
and
the
maid
had
not
heard
her
he
took
the
ruby
out
of
his
pocket
opened
the
little
case
looked
at
the
jewel
shining
there
under
the
electric
light
thought
of
clare
with
a
sudden
rush
of
passionate
affection
dear
thing
wo
she
look
lovely
in
it
her
neck
so
white
and
she
never
worn
much
jewellery
she
be
pleased
she
know
why
i
giving
it
to
her
now
a
kind
of
seal
on
what
we
agreed
to
the
other
night
a
new
life
new
altogether
he
was
conscious
as
he
took
his
shirt
off
that
his
windows
were
open
and
a
strange
scent
of
burning
leaves
was
with
him
in
the
room
it
was
quite
strong
pungent
very
pleasant
that
sense
of
burning
burning
leaves
in
the
orchard
but
it
was
rather
cold
then
he
came
back
to
his
and
standing
there
naked
save
for
his
dress
trousers
he
saw
that
he
was
looking
in
much
better
health
than
he
had
looked
for
weeks
the
colour
had
returned
to
his
face
his
eyes
were
brighter
and
more
alert
the
lines
had
gone
he
was
strong
and
vigorous
as
he
stood
there
his
body
shining
under
the
glow
he
opened
and
shut
his
hands
feeling
the
strength
force
in
his
fingers
sturdy
with
his
shoulders
back
again
now
straight
not
bent
as
they
had
been
oh
i
all
right
i
all
right
you
know
i
write
some
stuff
one
day
and
even
behind
that
his
thought
was
that
young
galleon
by
jove
i
could
jolly
well
break
him
if
i
wanted
to
just
snap
him
and
then
the
odour
of
the
burnt
leaves
filled
his
nostrils
again
when
he
had
dressed
he
turned
out
the
light
opened
the
windows
more
widely
and
stood
for
a
moment
there
smelling
the
smoke
feeling
the
air
on
his
forehead
seeing
the
dark
fluttering
shadows
of
the
trees
the
silver
moon
the
dim
red
haze
of
the
london
sky
ii
he
went
down
to
his
study
clare
must
be
in
now
bobby
would
be
here
in
a
few
minutes
he
took
up
the
but
his
mind
wandered
mr
penning
bruce
was
at
his
best
last
night
in
the
new
musical
comedy
produced
at
the
apollo
theatre
the
humour
of
his
performance
as
lieutenant
pottle
a
humour
never
exaggerated
nor
strained
but
he
could
attend
he
looked
up
at
the
little
clock
and
saw
that
it
was
nearly
bobby
ought
to
be
here
he
stood
up
and
listened
the
house
was
profoundly
silent
it
was
often
silent
but
it
was
as
though
everything
in
the
house
the
furniture
the
pictures
were
listening
as
though
the
roundabout
itself
listened
he
went
into
the
hall
stood
for
a
moment
under
the
stairs
and
then
called
clare
he
waited
and
then
again
clare
clare
i
say
it
late
come
along
there
was
no
answer
then
crossing
the
hall
he
opened
the
door
of
the
little
and
looked
in
it
was
black
and
empty
here
too
he
could
smell
the
burning
leaves
he
switched
on
the
light
and
instantly
perched
against
the
velasquez
infanta
saw
the
letter
white
and
still
before
the
pink
and
grey
of
the
picture
at
the
sight
of
the
letter
the
room
that
had
been
empty
and
cold
was
suddenly
burning
hot
and
filled
with
a
thousand
voices
take
it
take
it
why
do
you
take
it
it
been
waiting
there
for
you
a
long
time
and
we
all
been
wondering
when
you
were
coming
in
for
it
it
waiting
there
for
you
take
it
take
it
take
it
at
the
sight
of
it
too
the
floor
of
the
room
seemed
instantly
to
pitch
slanting
downwards
like
the
deck
of
a
sinking
ship
he
caught
on
to
the
back
of
a
chair
in
order
that
he
might
not
slip
with
it
his
hands
shook
and
there
was
a
great
pain
at
his
heart
as
though
some
one
were
pulling
it
tight
then
squeezing
it
in
their
fingers
and
letting
it
go
again
then
as
suddenly
all
his
agitation
fled
the
room
was
cold
and
empty
again
and
his
hands
were
steady
he
took
the
letter
and
read
it
it
was
written
in
great
agitation
and
almost
illegible
and
at
the
bottom
of
the
paper
there
was
a
dirty
smudge
that
might
have
been
a
tear
stain
or
a
finger
mark
it
ran
must
go
i
have
been
so
unhappy
for
so
long
and
we
do
get
on
together
peter
now
you
do
understand
me
and
i
must
be
happy
i
had
always
been
happy
until
i
married
you
perhaps
it
partly
my
fault
but
i
only
hinder
your
work
and
there
is
some
one
else
who
loves
me
he
has
always
said
so
i
would
not
have
gone
perhaps
if
it
had
not
been
for
what
you
did
on
april
i
know
because
some
one
saw
you
getting
into
a
cab
at
midnight
with
that
horrible
woman
that
shows
that
you
do
care
about
me
peter
but
perhaps
i
would
have
gone
anyhow
once
the
night
i
told
you
about
baby
coming
i
told
you
there
be
a
time
when
you
have
to
hold
me
it
came
and
you
did
see
it
you
did
care
you
ca
have
loved
me
or
you
would
have
seen
but
anything
is
better
than
staying
here
like
this
i
am
very
unhappy
now
but
you
will
not
care
you
are
cruel
and
hard
peter
you
have
never
understood
what
a
woman
wants
i
am
going
to
jerry
in
paris
you
can
divorce
me
i
do
care
about
anything
now
i
wo
come
back
i
wo
i
wo
he
read
this
all
through
very
carefully
with
a
serious
brow
he
finished
it
and
then
knew
that
he
had
not
read
a
word
of
it
he
went
slowly
to
the
window
and
opened
it
because
the
room
was
of
a
stifling
heat
then
he
took
the
letter
again
and
read
it
as
he
finished
it
again
he
was
conscious
that
the
was
ringing
he
wondered
why
it
was
ringing
he
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
speaking
to
himself
the
humour
of
his
performance
as
lieutenant
pottle
a
humour
never
exaggerated
nor
strained
the
humour
of
his
lieutenant
pottle
as
a
performer
never
strained
never
exaggerated
never
strained
bobby
came
in
and
found
him
there
peter
face
was
so
white
that
his
collar
and
shirt
seemed
to
be
a
continuation
of
his
body
a
sudden
gruesome
nakedness
both
his
hands
were
shaking
and
his
eyes
were
puzzled
as
though
he
were
asking
himself
some
question
that
he
could
not
solve
bobby
started
forward
god
peter
what
she
gone
away
bobby
peter
said
in
a
voice
that
shook
a
little
but
was
otherwise
grave
and
almost
a
whisper
so
low
was
it
she
gone
away
to
then
he
added
to
himself
cardillac
is
my
best
then
he
said
listen
and
he
read
the
letter
straight
through
he
repeated
some
of
the
phrases
what
you
did
on
april
that
shows
that
you
do
care
you
are
cruel
and
hard
peter
i
am
going
to
jerry

she
going
over
to
him
because
she

more

about
her

that
funny
when
i

so
much
bobby
went
to
him
put
his
arm
round
his
neck
peter
dear
peter
wait
and
then
oh
my
god
we
must
stop
her
he
drew
himself
away
from
bobby
arm
and
very
unsteadily
went
across
the
room
and
then
stood
against
the
farther
wall
his
head
bent
motionless
stop
her
oh
no
bobby
stop
her
when
she
wants
to
go
i
his
voice
was
peter
voice
it
was
a
thin
monotonous
voice
like
some
one
speaking
at
a
great
distance
then
it
seemed
that
intelligence
was
flashed
upon
him
he
lurched
forward
and
with
a
great
voice
as
though
he
had
been
struck
by
some
sudden
agonising
immortal
pain
bobby
bobby
my
wife
clare
and
at
that
instant
rossiter
was
shown
into
the
room
iii
the
maid
who
opened
the
door
had
apparently
some
suspicion
that
things
were
odd
because
she
waited
for
a
moment
before
she
closed
the
door
again
staring
with
wide
eyes
into
the
room
catching
perhaps
some
hint
from
her
master
white
face
that
something
terrible
had
occurred
it
was
obvious
enough
that
rossiter
had
herself
during
the
last
week
been
in
no
easy
mind
from
the
first
glances
at
peter
and
bobby
she
seemed
to
understand
everything
for
instantly
at
that
glimpse
of
their
faces
she
became
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
perhaps
a
personality
a
figure
something
defined
and
outlined
her
face
was
suddenly
grey
she
hesitated
back
against
the
door
and
with
her
face
on
peter
said
in
a
whisper
to
bobby
what
what
has
happened
bobby
was
not
inclined
to
spare
her
as
an
onlooker
during
these
last
months
he
felt
that
she
perhaps
was
more
guiltily
responsible
for
the
catastrophe
than
any
other
human
being
clare
he
said
trying
to
fix
her
eyes
she
gone
off
to
cardillac
to
then
he
was
himself
held
by
the
tragedy
of
those
two
faces
they
faced
each
other
across
the
room
peter
with
eyes
and
a
mouth
that
were
not
his
eyes
not
sane
the
eyes
of
no
human
being
mouth
smiling
drawn
tight
like
a
razor
edge
with
his
hands
spread
out
against
the
wall
watched
rossiter
rossiter
at
bobby
words
had
huddled
up
suddenly
broken
only
her
eyes
in
her
great
foolish
expressionless
face
stung
to
an
agony
to
which
the
rest
of
her
body
could
not
move
her
little
soul
a
tiny
scrap
of
a
thing
in
that
vague
prison
of
dull
flesh
was
suddenly
wounded
desperately
hurt
by
the
only
weapon
that
could
ever
have
found
it
clare
that
soul
whispered
not
gone
it
not
possible
it
be
it
ca
be
peter
without
moving
spoke
to
her
it
you
that
have
sent
her
away
it
all
your
doing
all
your
doing
she
scarcely
seemed
to
realise
him
although
her
eyes
never
left
his
face
she
came
up
to
bobby
her
hands
out
bobby
please
please
tell
me
this
is
absurd
there
a
mistake
clare
clare
would
never
do
a
thing
like
that
never
leave
me
like
that
why
and
her
voice
rose
i
loved
her
i
loved
her
as
no
mother
ever
loved
her
girl
she
been
everything
to
me
she
knows
it
why
she
often
says
that
i
the
only
one
who
loves
her
she
never
go
then
peter
came
forward
from
the
wall
muttering
waving
his
hands
at
her
it
you
you
you
you
driven
her
to
this
you
and
your
cursed
interference
you
took
her
from
me
you
told
her
to
deceive
me
in
everything
you
taught
her
to
lie
and
trick
she
loved
me
before
you
came
into
it
now
be
proud
if
you
like
now
be
proud
god
damn
you
for
making
your
daughter
into
a
whore
that
what
you
done
you
with
your
flat
face
your
filthy
flat
face
you
made
your
daughter
a
whore
i
tell
you
and
it
nothing
but
you
you
you
he
lifted
his
hand
as
though
he
would
strike
her
across
the
face
she
said
nothing
but
started
back
with
her
hands
up
as
though
to
protect
herself
he
did
not
strike
her
his
hand
fell
but
she
as
though
she
had
felt
a
blow
had
her
hand
held
to
her
face
he
stood
over
her
for
a
moment
laughing
his
head
flung
back
then
still
laughing
he
went
away
from
them
out
into
the
hall
then
through
the
open
door
they
heard
him
he
passed
through
the
upper
rooms
crying
out
as
he
went
clare
clare
where
are
you
come
down
they
here
for
dinner
you
wanted
it
time
clare
where
are
you
clare
clare
they
heard
him
knocking
furniture
over
as
he
went
then
there
was
silence
rossiter
seemed
at
that
to
come
to
herself
she
stood
up
feeling
her
cheek
it
sent
him
off
his
head
bobby
go
after
him
he
hurt
then
as
though
to
herself
she
went
on
i
must
find
clare
she
be
in
paris
i
suppose
i
must
go
and
find
her
bobby
she
want
me
she
went
quietly
from
the
room
still
with
her
hand
to
her
cheek
she
listened
for
a
moment
in
the
hall
she
turned
round
to
bobby
it
does
say
the
letter
where
clare
gone
no
only
he
helped
her
on
with
her
cloak
and
opened
the
front
door
for
her
she
slipped
away
down
the
street
bobby
turned
back
and
saw
that
peter
was
coming
down
the
stairs
but
now
the
fury
had
all
died
from
his
face
only
that
look
as
of
some
animal
wounded
to
death
a
look
that
was
so
deep
and
terrible
as
almost
to
give
his
white
face
no
expression
at
all
was
with
him
it
had
been
with
him
at
stephen
death
it
was
with
him
far
more
intensely
now
he
looked
at
bobby
she
gone
in
a
tired
dull
voice
as
of
some
one
nearly
asleep
gone
to
cardillac
i
loved
cards
and
all
the
time
he
loved
clare
i
loved
clare
and
all
the
time
she
loved
cards
it
damned
funny
is
it
bobby
old
man
he
stood
facing
him
in
the
hall
no
part
of
him
moving
except
his
mouth
she
says
i
treated
her
like
a
brute
i
do
think
i
did
she
says
there
was
something
i
did
one
night
i
do
know
i
never
done
anything
i
never
been
with
another
woman
something
about
a
cab
perhaps
it
was
poor
rose
bennett
poor
rose
bennett
damned
unhappy
so
am
i
so
am
i
a
lonely
fellow
i
always
have
been
he
went
past
bobby
back
into
the
little
bobby
followed
him
he
turned
round
you
can
go
now
bobby
i
sha
want
you
any
no
i
going
to
i
do
want
you
i
do
want
any
i
going
to
i
rather
you
went
i
going
to
peter
paid
no
more
attention
he
went
and
sat
down
on
a
chair
by
the
window
bobby
sat
down
on
a
chair
near
him
once
peter
said
they
took
my
baby
they
took
my
work
they
taken
my
wife
they
too
much
for
me
i
then
there
was
absolute
silence
in
the
house
the
servants
who
had
heard
the
tumbling
of
the
furniture
crept
frightened
to
bed
thus
the
roundabout
dark
utterly
without
sound
stayed
through
the
night
once
from
the
chair
by
the
window
in
the
little
a
voice
said
i
going
back
to
scaw
house
to
my
father
i
going
back
to
all
of
during
many
hours
the
little
silver
clock
ticked
cheerfully
seeing
perhaps
with
its
little
bright
eyes
the
two
dark
figures
and
wondering
what
they
did
there
book
iv
scaw
house
chapter
i
the
sea
i
peter
westcott
was
dead
they
put
his
body
into
the
from
paddington
ii
it
was
a
day
of
high
swinging
winds
of
dappled
skies
of
shining
gleaming
water
bunches
now
and
again
of
heavy
black
clouds
clustered
on
the
horizon
the
cows
and
horses
in
the
fields
were
sharply
defined
standing
out
rigidly
against
a
distant
background
the
sun
came
and
was
gone
laughed
and
was
instantly
hidden
turned
the
world
from
light
to
shadow
and
from
shadow
back
to
light
again
peter
body
was
alone
in
the
compartment
it
was
propped
up
against
red
velvet
that
yielded
with
a
hard
clenched
resistance
something
uncomfortable
had
the
body
minded
the
eyes
of
the
body
were
the
high
blank
windows
of
a
deserted
house
behind
them
were
rooms
and
passages
but
lately
so
gaily
crowded
so
eager
with
their
lights
and
fires
for
hustling
life
now
suddenly
empty
swept
of
all
its
recent
company
waiting
for
new
for
very
different
inhabitants
the
white
hands
motionless
upon
the
knees
the
eyes
facing
the
light
but
blind
the
body
still
against
the
velvet
throughout
the
long
long
day
iii
there
were
occasions
when
some
one
came
and
asked
for
his
ticket
some
one
came
once
and
asked
him
whether
he
would
take
once
a
woman
flushed
and
excited
laden
with
parcels
tumbled
into
his
carriage
and
then
after
a
glance
at
the
white
face
tumbled
out
again
then
from
very
very
far
away
came
the
first
whispered
breath
of
returning
consciousness
the
afternoon
sun
now
had
banished
the
black
clouds
the
wind
had
fallen
the
sky
was
a
quiet
blue
and
birds
rose
and
fell
rivers
shone
and
had
passed
roads
were
white
like
ribbons
broad
and
brown
like
crinkled
paper
then
ribbons
again
as
the
train
flung
devonshire
scornfully
behind
its
back
peter
was
conscious
that
his
body
was
once
more
to
be
tenanted
but
by
whom
here
was
some
one
coming
to
him
now
some
one
who
as
the
evening
light
fell
about
the
land
dark
with
his
cloak
to
his
face
came
softly
upon
the
house
and
knocked
at
the
door
peter
could
hear
his
knock
it
echoed
through
the
empty
passages
the
deserted
rooms
it
was
a
knock
that
demanded
imperatively
admittance
the
door
swung
back
the
black
passages
gaped
upon
the
evening
light
and
were
closed
again
the
house
was
once
more
silent
but
no
longer
untenanted
iv
peter
was
now
conscious
of
the
world
that
was
exeter
that
they
had
left
behind
them
and
soon
there
would
be
plymouth
and
then
the
crossing
of
the
bridge
and
then
cornwall
cornwall
his
lips
were
dry
he
touched
them
with
his
tongue
and
knew
suddenly
that
he
was
thirsty
more
thirsty
than
he
had
ever
been
he
would
never
be
hungry
again
but
he
would
always
be
thirsty
an
attendant
passed
what
should
he
drink
the
attendant
suggested
a
whisky
and
soda
yes
a
large
whisky
it
was
very
long
indeed
since
he
had
been
in
cornwall
he
had
not
been
there
since
his
boyhood
what
had
he
been
doing
all
the
time
in
between
he
did
not
know
he
had
no
idea
this
new
tenant
of
the
house
was
not
aware
of
those
intervening
years
was
only
conscious
that
he
was
returning
after
long
exile
to
his
home
scaw
house
yes
that
was
the
name
the
house
with
the
trees
and
the
grey
stone
walls
yes
he
would
be
glad
to
be
at
home
again
with
his
father
his
father
would
welcome
him
after
so
long
an
absence
the
whisky
and
soda
was
brought
to
him
and
as
he
drank
it
they
crossed
the
border
and
were
in
cornwall
v
they
were
at
trewth
that
little
station
where
you
must
change
for
treliss
it
stood
open
to
all
the
winds
of
heaven
two
lines
of
paling
a
little
strip
of
platform
standing
desolately
at
wistful
attention
in
the
heart
of
gently
breathing
fields
mild
skies
dark
trees
bending
together
as
though
whispering
secrets
all
mysterious
and
from
the
earth
there
rose
that
breath
gorse
soil
saffron
grey
stone
that
breath
that
is
only
cornwall
peter
somewhere
in
some
strange
dim
recesses
of
his
soul
felt
it
about
his
body
the
wind
bringing
all
these
scents
touched
his
cheek
and
his
hair
and
he
was
conscious
that
that
dark
traveller
who
now
tenanted
his
house
closed
the
doors
and
windows
upon
that
breath
it
might
waken
consciousness
and
consciousness
memory
and
memory
pain
ah
pain
down
with
the
shutters
bolt
the
doors
no
vision
of
the
outer
world
must
enter
here
the
little
station
received
gratefully
the
evening
light
that
had
descended
upon
it
a
few
men
and
women
dim
bundles
of
figures
against
the
pale
blue
waited
for
the
train
a
crescent
moon
was
stealing
above
the
hedges
from
the
chimneys
of
two
little
cottages
grey
smoke
trembled
in
the
air
suddenly
there
came
to
peter
waiting
there
the
determination
to
drive
he
could
not
stand
there
surrounded
by
this
happy
silence
any
longer
all
those
shadows
that
were
creeping
about
the
dark
spaces
beyond
his
house
were
only
waiting
for
their
moment
when
they
might
leap
this
silence
this
peace
would
give
them
that
moment
he
must
drive
he
must
drive
in
the
road
outside
the
station
a
decrepit
cab
with
a
thin
rake
of
a
man
for
driver
was
waiting
for
a
possible
customer
the
cab
was
faded
the
wheels
encrusted
with
ancient
mud
the
horse
old
and
wheezy
but
the
cabman
standing
now
thinner
than
ever
against
the
sky
was
in
spite
of
a
tattered
top
hat
filled
with
that
cheerful
optimism
that
belongs
to
the
cornishman
who
sees
an
opportunity
of
doing
a
foreigner
i
want
to
drive
to
treliss
said
peter
they
bargained
the
battered
optimist
obtained
the
price
that
he
demanded
and
cocked
his
eye
derisively
at
the
rising
moon
peter
surveyed
the
cab
i
sit
with
you
on
the
box
he
said
the
thin
driver
made
way
for
him
it
was
a
high
jolting
cab
of
the
kind
a
cab
you
might
have
sworn
was
cornish
had
you
seen
it
anywhere
a
cab
that
smelt
of
beer
and
ancient
leather
and
salt
water
a
cab
that
had
once
driven
the
fashion
of
treliss
to
elegant
dances
and
now
must
rattle
the
roads
with
very
little
to
see
for
all
your
trouble
at
the
end
of
it
the
sleeping
fields
like
grey
cloths
stretched
on
every
side
of
them
and
the
white
road
cut
into
the
heart
of
the
distance
it
was
a
quarter
to
eight
and
a
blue
dusk
the
driver
tilted
the
top
hat
over
one
ear
and
they
were
off
i
know
this
road
as
yer
might
say
ask
any
one
down
along
treliss
way
zachy
jackson
they
say
which
is
my
name
sir
if
yer
requirin
a
good
any
time
o
day
zachy
jackson
which
there
no
man
tarkin
of
fit
to
touch
they
tell
yer
and
not
far
wrong
but
now
with
every
stumbling
step
of
that
bony
horse
peter
was
being
shaken
into
a
more
active
consciousness
consciousness
not
of
the
past
very
slightly
of
the
present
but
rather
of
an
eager
excited
anticipation
of
events
shortly
to
befall
him
of
the
acute
sense
the
first
that
had
as
yet
come
to
him
that
very
shortly
he
was
to
plunge
himself
into
an
absolute
abandonment
of
all
the
restraints
and
discipline
that
had
hitherto
held
him
he
did
not
know
he
could
not
analyse
to
himself
for
what
purpose
those
restraints
had
been
formerly
enforced
upon
his
life
only
now
at
this
moment
his
body
was
being
flooded
with
a
warm
riotous
satisfaction
at
the
thought
of
the
indulgences
that
were
to
be
his
still
this
fortress
of
his
house
was
bare
and
desolated
but
now
in
some
of
the
rooms
there
were
lights
fire
whispers
faces
eyes
behind
curtains
the
wind
struck
him
in
the
face
enough
of
this
you
done
for
you
beaten
you
broken
you
going
back
to
your
hovel
you
creeping
home
do
make
a
fine
thing
of
it
the
wind
said
the
top
of
the
hill
rolled
up
to
them
and
suddenly
with
the
gust
that
came
from
every
quarter
there
was
borne
some
sound
it
was
very
delicate
very
mysterious
the
sound
one
might
fancy
that
the
earth
would
make
if
all
spring
flowers
were
to
pierce
the
soil
at
one
common
instant
so
fugitive
a
whisper
that
the
sea
said
jackson
waving
his
whip
in
the
air
down
to
dunotter
cove
there
a
wind
it
blow
rough
now
from
their
hilltop
in
the
light
of
a
baby
moon
puddles
of
water
shone
like
silk
hedges
were
bending
lines
of
listeners
far
on
the
horizon
a
black
wood
there
in
one
of
those
precipitous
valleys
cottages
cowering
overhead
the
blue
night
sky
suddenly
chequered
with
solemn
pompous
slowly
moving
clouds
but
here
on
the
hilltop
at
any
rate
a
bustle
of
wind
such
a
noise
amongst
the
hedges
and
the
pools
instantly
ruffled
and
then
quiet
again
and
so
precipitous
a
darkness
when
a
cloud
swallowed
the
moon
in
the
daylight
that
landscape
to
any
who
loved
not
cornwall
would
seem
ugly
indeed
with
a
grey
cottage
stuck
here
and
there
naked
upon
the
moor
with
a
bare
deserted
engine
house
upon
the
horizon
with
trees
deep
in
the
little
valley
but
scant
and
staggering
upon
the
hill
ugly
by
day
but
now
packed
with
a
mystery
that
contains
everything
that
human
language
has
no
name
for
there
is
nothing
to
do
on
beholding
it
but
to
kneel
down
and
worship
god
jackson
had
seen
it
often
before
and
he
went
twice
to
chapel
every
sunday
so
he
just
whipped
up
his
horse
and
they
stumbled
down
the
road
dirty
weather
coming
he
said
peter
was
disturbed
that
whispering
noise
that
had
crept
across
the
country
frightened
him
if
it
went
on
much
longer
it
would
make
him
remember
he
must
not
remember
they
turned
down
into
a
deep
mysterious
lane
and
the
whisper
was
hidden
now
there
was
about
them
only
the
urgent
crowding
of
the
hedges
the
flinging
their
scent
on
to
the
night
air
and
above
and
below
and
on
every
side
of
the
old
cab
there
streamed
into
the
air
the
sweet
smell
of
crushed
grass
as
though
many
fields
had
been
pressed
between
giant
fingers
and
so
had
been
left
peter
sat
there
and
about
him
like
flames
licking
woodwork
evil
thoughts
devoured
his
body
he
was
going
now
at
last
to
do
all
those
things
that
these
many
years
he
had
prevented
himself
from
doing
that
at
any
rate
he
knew
he
would
drink
and
drink
and
drink
until
he
would
never
remember
anything
again
never
again
meanwhile
as
the
cab
slowly
began
to
climb
the
hill
again
jackson
was
telling
a
story
he
rolled
his
r
as
though
life
were
indeed
a
valuable
and
happy
thing
and
now
and
again
waving
his
thin
whip
in
the
air
he
would
seem
to
appeal
to
the
moon
was
down
to
dunotter
cove
and
i
a
lad
my
father
bein
a
fisherman
and
one
night
i
mind
it
as
though
it
were
yesterday
there
was
a
mighty
wreck
storm
and
wind
and
rain
there
was
that
night
and
there
we
were
out
in
it
suddenly
all
the
village
of
us
i
but
a
slip
of
a
boy
you
must
know
which
it
was
thirty
year
back
now
and
the
rain
sizzling
on
the
cobbles
and
the
wind
blawin
the
chimneys
crooked
well
she
were
a
mighty
wreck
blawn
right
up
against
the
dunotter
rocks
you
understand
and
sendin
up
rockets
and
we
seein
her
clear
enough
black
out
to
sea
which
she
seemed
enormous
in
the
night
time
and
all
my
father
and
the
rest
of
went
out
in
the
boat
we
waited
and
we
waited
and
they
did
come
back
they
never
come
back
none
of
them
only
a
crazed
luny
bill
tregothny
was
washed
up
against
the
rocks
down
to
bosillian
and
were
just
livin
and
when
it
come
daylight
jackson
cleared
his
throat
and
paused
when
it
come
daylight
there
was
no
wreck
nothing
nor
no
bodies
neither
nothing
only
bill
tregothny
the
fool
peter
had
heard
no
single
word
of
this
his
ears
were
straining
for
the
return
of
that
whisper
they
were
nearly
once
again
at
the
hilltop
then
in
front
of
them
there
would
be
the
sea
at
the
top
of
the
hill
there
would
be
the
sea
he
was
seized
with
a
great
terror
frightened
like
a
child
in
the
dark
bill
tregothny
you
must
understand
sir
always
been
a
idiot
always
born
so
when
was
all
well
again
told
strange
tales
about
the
lot
of
them
havin
boarded
the
vessel
and
there
bein
gold
all
over
the
decks
bars
of
it
with
the
rain
fallin
all
about
it
piled
in
and
said
the
sailors
were
like
common
sailors
yer
knew
but
all
in
silks
with
cocked
hats
and
the
gold
all
about
o
course
bill
was
the
idiot
you
must
understand
but
it
true
enough
that
there
were
no
vessel
in
the
marnin
no
vessel
at
all
and
my
father
and
the
rest
were
never
seen
again
nor
no
bodies
neither
and
they
say
here
jackson
dropped
his
voice
they
were
just
at
the
top
of
the
hill
now
peter
was
sitting
with
his
hands
clenched
his
body
trembling
they
do
say
that
up
in
the
potato
field
over
dunotter
they
seen
a
man
all
in
a
cocked
hat
and
red
silk
and
gold
lace
a
ghost
you
must
understand
sir
which
bill
tregothny
says
the
sea
broke
upon
them
with
an
instant
menacing
roar
between
them
and
this
violence
there
was
now
only
moorland
rough
with
gorse
bushes
uneven
with
little
pits
of
sand
scented
with
sea
pinks
with
stony
tracks
here
and
there
where
the
moonlight
touched
it
but
across
it
like
a
mob
menace
fell
the
thunder
flung
up
to
them
from
below
swelling
from
a
menace
to
a
sudden
crash
then
from
crash
to
echo
dying
to
murmur
again
it
had
in
it
anger
and
power
also
pity
and
tenderness
also
scorn
and
defiance
it
cared
for
no
one
it
loved
every
one
it
was
more
intimate
than
any
confidence
ever
made
and
then
it
shouted
that
intimacy
to
the
whole
world
it
flung
itself
into
face
beat
his
body
lashed
his
soul
oh
you
young
fool
you
come
slinking
back
have
you
after
all
these
years
you
come
slinking
back
where
are
all
your
fine
hopes
now
where
all
those
early
defiances
those
vast
ambitions
worthless
broken
defeated
worthless
broken
and
then
it
seemed
to
change
peter
peter
hold
out
a
little
longer
the
battle
is
over
yet
struggle
on
for
a
little
peter
i
help
you
i
bring
your
courage
back
to
you
trust
me
peter
trust
me
through
the
rattle
of
the
surf
there
came
the
sick
melancholy
lowing
of
the
bell
rock
swinging
over
a
space
of
waters
it
fell
across
fields
unutterably
abominably
sad
and
in
the
boy
there
instantly
leapt
to
life
his
soul
maimed
and
bruised
and
stunned
it
had
been
now
alive
tearing
him
bringing
on
to
his
bending
shoulders
an
awful
tide
of
knowledge
everything
is
gone
your
wife
your
boy
your
friend
your
work
we
have
won
peter
we
have
won
the
house
is
waiting
for
you
and
above
those
dreadful
voices
the
thundering
echo
indifferent
to
his
agonies
despising
his
frailties
flinging
him
of
the
most
miserable
to
any
insignificant
end
peter
suddenly
stood
up
rocking
on
his
box
he
seized
the
whip
from
the
driver
hands
he
lashed
the
miserable
horse
get
on
you
devil
get
on
leave
this
noise
behind
you
get
out
of
it
get
out
of
it
the
cab
rocked
and
tossed
jackson
caught
the
boy
about
the
shoulders
held
him
down
the
horse
tired
and
weary
paid
no
heed
to
anything
that
might
be
happening
but
stumbled
on
good
lord
sir
jackson
cried
you
might
have
had
us
over
it
all
about
sir
but
peter
now
was
huddled
down
with
his
coat
about
his
ears
and
did
not
move
again
catchin
the
whip
like
that
might
us
right
into
the
muttered
jackson
wishing
his
journey
well
over
as
they
turned
the
corner
the
lights
of
treliss
burst
into
view
chapter
ii
scaw
house
i
jackson
inquired
as
to
the
hotel
that
peter
preferred
and
was
told
to
drive
anywhere
so
he
chose
the
man
at
arms
the
man
at
arms
had
been
turned
by
young
bannister
from
a
small
insignificant
hostelry
into
the
most
important
hotel
in
the
west
of
england
it
stood
above
the
town
looking
over
the
bay
the
roofs
of
the
new
town
the
cottages
of
the
old
one
the
curving
island
to
the
right
the
lighthouse
to
the
left
all
cornwall
in
those
grey
stones
that
blue
sea
the
grave
fishing
boats
the
flocks
of
gulls
far
far
below
bannister
had
spared
no
trouble
over
the
man
at
arms
and
now
it
was
luxuriously
modern
elizabethan
with
an
old
minstrels
gallery
kept
studiously
dusty
and
the
most
splendid
old
oak
and
deep
with
electric
light
cunningly
arranged
and
baths
in
every
passage
of
course
you
paid
for
this
skilful
and
comfortable
romance
but
bannister
always
managed
his
bills
so
delicately
that
you
expected
to
find
a
poem
by
suckling
or
lovelace
on
the
back
of
them
when
peter
had
been
last
in
treliss
the
man
at
arms
had
scarcely
existed
but
he
was
now
utterly
unconscious
of
it
and
stood
in
the
dim
square
hall
talking
to
bannister
like
a
man
in
a
dream
he
was
aware
now
that
he
was
exhausted
with
a
fatigue
that
was
beyond
anything
that
he
had
ever
experienced
it
was
a
weariness
that
was
not
under
any
conditions
to
be
resisted
he
must
lie
down
here
anywhere
now
at
once
and
sleep
sleep
sleep
bannister
caught
him
by
the
arm
as
he
swayed
you
looked
played
out
done
up
done
up
his
eyes
were
closed
then
suddenly
he
had
touched
shoulder
he
was
looking
at
a
wire
letter
rack
hanging
by
the
superintendent
little
office
there
were
some
telegrams
and
many
letters
stretched
behind
the
wire
netting
one
envelope
was
addressed
norah
monogue
the
man
at
arms
hotel
treliss
miss
monogue
miss
monogue
have
you
any
one
here
called
miss
monogue
yes
sir
been
here
some
weeks
poor
lady
she
very
ill
i
afraid
something
to
do
with
her
heart
strained
it
in
some
way
seemed
much
better
but
the
last
few
days
peter
stumbled
upstairs
to
his
room
ii
some
clock
was
striking
five
when
he
awoke
and
looking
vaguely
about
his
room
saw
by
the
light
that
it
must
be
late
afternoon
he
must
have
slept
for
a
day
and
a
night
as
he
lay
back
on
his
bed
his
first
moments
of
consciousness
were
filled
with
a
pleasant
sense
of
rest
and
ease
he
remembered
nothing
he
only
knew
that
in
the
air
there
was
the
breath
of
flowers
and
that
through
the
open
window
there
floated
up
to
him
a
song
a
murmur
of
the
sea
a
rattle
of
little
carts
he
looked
about
his
room
on
a
distant
wall
there
was
a
photograph
dunotter
rocks
from
the
then
he
remembered
he
flung
the
off
him
and
hurried
to
dress
he
must
go
up
to
scaw
house
at
once
at
once
at
once
not
another
moment
must
be
wasted
his
hands
trembled
as
he
put
on
his
clothes
and
when
he
came
downstairs
he
was
dishevelled
and
untidy
he
had
eaten
nothing
for
many
hours
but
food
now
would
have
choked
him
he
hurried
out
of
the
hotel
the
town
must
have
had
many
recollections
to
offer
him
had
he
observed
it
but
he
passed
through
it
looking
neither
to
the
right
nor
the
left
brushing
people
aside
striding
with
great
steps
up
the
steep
cobbled
street
that
leads
out
of
the
town
on
to
the
sea
road
here
on
the
sea
road
he
paused
the
wind
tearing
as
it
had
always
done
round
the
corner
met
him
and
for
a
moment
he
had
to
pull
himself
together
and
face
it
he
remembered
too
at
that
instant
norah
monogue
where
had
he
seen
her
what
had
brought
her
to
his
mind
quite
lately
what
did
she
mean
by
interfering
interfering
then
he
remembered
it
was
her
name
in
the
letter
rack
she
was
at
the
man
at
arms
impatiently
he
would
have
driven
her
from
him
but
all
the
way
down
the
sea
road
she
kept
pace
with
him
i
done
with
her
i
done
with
everybody
damn
it
all
one
keeps
thinking
in
the
evening
light
the
sea
below
the
road
was
a
pale
blue
and
near
the
shore
a
calm
green
it
was
all
very
peaceful
the
water
lapped
the
shore
the
bell
rock
sighed
its
melancholy
note
across
space
out
a
little
way
when
some
jagged
stones
sprang
like
shoulders
from
the
blue
gentle
waves
ringed
them
in
foam
like
lace
and
broke
with
a
whisper
against
their
sides
except
for
the
sea
there
was
absolute
silence
peter
alone
seemed
to
walk
the
world
as
he
strode
along
his
excitement
increased
and
his
knees
trembled
and
his
eyes
were
burning
he
did
not
think
of
the
earlier
days
when
he
had
walked
that
same
road
that
was
another
existence
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
him
as
he
was
now
the
anticipation
that
possessed
him
was
parallel
with
the
eager
demand
of
the
soon
i
shall
be
drugged
i
going
to
forget
to
forget
to
forget
just
to
let
myself
go
to
sink
to
he
had
still
with
him
the
consciousness
of
keeping
at
bay
an
army
of
thoughts
that
would
leap
upon
him
if
he
gave
them
an
opportunity
but
soon
that
would
be
all
over
no
more
battle
no
more
struggle
he
turned
the
corner
and
saw
scaw
house
standing
amongst
its
dark
trees
with
its
black
palings
in
front
of
its
garden
and
the
deserted
barren
patch
of
field
in
front
of
that
again
the
sun
was
getting
low
and
the
sky
above
the
house
was
flaming
but
the
trees
were
sombre
and
the
house
was
cold
it
did
not
seem
to
him
to
have
changed
in
any
way
since
he
had
left
it
the
windows
had
always
been
of
a
grim
hideous
glass
the
stone
shape
of
the
place
always
squat
and
ugly
and
the
short
flight
of
steps
that
led
up
to
the
heavy
beetling
door
had
always
hinted
with
their
old
hard
surface
at
a
surly
welcome
and
a
reluctant
courtesy
it
was
all
as
it
had
been
the
sky
now
a
burning
red
looked
down
upon
an
utterly
deserted
garden
and
the
silence
that
was
over
all
the
place
seemed
to
rise
like
streaming
mist
from
the
heart
of
the
nettles
that
grew
thick
along
the
crumbling
wall
the
paint
had
faded
from
the
door
and
the
knocker
was
rusty
as
peter
hammered
his
arrival
on
to
the
flat
silence
a
bird
flew
from
the
black
bunch
of
trees
whirred
into
the
air
and
was
gone
for
a
long
time
after
the
echo
of
his
knock
had
faded
away
there
was
silence
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
this
could
be
only
another
of
those
dreams
those
dreams
when
he
had
stood
on
the
stone
steps
in
the
heart
of
the
deserted
garden
and
woken
the
echoes
through
the
empty
house
at
last
there
were
steps
some
one
came
along
the
passage
and
halted
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
and
listened
they
both
waited
on
either
side
and
peter
could
hear
heavy
thick
breathing
he
caught
the
knocker
again
and
let
it
go
with
a
clang
that
seemed
to
startle
the
house
to
its
foundations
then
he
heard
bolts
very
slowly
drawn
back
again
a
pause
and
then
stealthily
the
door
swung
open
a
scent
of
rotten
apples
met
him
as
the
door
opened
a
scent
so
strong
that
it
was
confused
at
once
with
his
vision
of
the
woman
who
stood
there
she
with
her
gnarled
and
puckered
face
her
brown
skin
and
crooked
nose
standing
as
it
were
for
an
actual
and
visible
personification
of
all
the
rotten
apples
that
had
ever
been
in
the
world
he
recognised
also
a
sound
the
drunken
hesitating
hiccough
of
the
old
clock
that
had
been
there
when
he
had
come
in
that
evening
long
ago
ready
to
receive
his
beating
that
had
kept
pace
with
his
snorings
and
mutterings
and
had
seemed
indeed
the
only
understanding
companion
that
the
old
man
had
ever
had
the
woman
was
he
saw
the
ferocious
cook
of
the
old
days
but
now
how
wrinkled
and
infirm
separated
by
so
many
more
years
than
the
lapse
of
time
allowed
her
from
the
woman
of
his
past
appearance
there
there
was
more
in
her
than
the
mere
crumbling
of
her
body
there
was
also
the
crumbling
of
her
spirit
and
he
saw
in
her
old
bleared
eyes
the
sign
of
some
fierce
battle
fought
by
her
and
fought
to
her
own
utter
defeat
in
her
eyes
he
saw
the
thing
that
his
father
had
become
what
did
he
want
she
asked
him
coming
disturbing
them
at
that
hour
but
in
her
face
there
was
he
fancied
something
more
than
the
surly
question
justified
some
curiosity
some
eagerness
that
seemed
to
show
that
she
did
not
have
many
visitors
here
and
that
their
company
might
be
an
eager
relief
i
peter
westcott
and
i
come
to
see
my
she
did
not
answer
this
but
only
with
her
hand
to
her
breast
stood
back
a
little
and
watched
him
with
frightened
eyes
she
was
wearing
an
old
faded
green
blouse
open
at
her
scraggy
neck
and
her
skirt
was
a
kind
of
odd
bits
of
stuffs
of
many
colours
stuck
together
her
scanty
hair
was
pulled
into
a
bunch
on
the
top
of
her
head
her
face
where
it
was
not
brown
was
purple
and
her
hands
were
always
shaking
so
that
her
fingers
rattled
together
like
twigs
but
her
alarmed
and
startled
eyes
had
some
appeal
that
made
one
pity
her
poor
battered
old
body
you
do
remember
me
he
said
looking
into
her
frightened
eyes
but
she
shook
her
head
slowly
you
much
better
have
kept
away
she
said
where
is
he
he
asked
her
she
shuffled
in
front
of
him
down
the
dark
hall
except
for
this
strange
smell
of
rotting
apples
it
was
all
very
much
as
it
had
been
the
lamp
hanging
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
made
the
same
spluttering
noise
and
there
was
the
door
of
the
room
that
had
once
been
his
grandfather
and
peter
fancied
that
he
could
still
see
the
old
man
swaying
there
in
the
doorway
laughing
at
his
son
and
his
grandson
as
they
struggled
there
on
the
floor
the
woman
pushed
open
the
door
and
peter
went
in
peter
first
thought
was
that
his
father
was
not
there
he
saw
standing
in
front
of
the
fireplace
a
gentleman
clothed
in
a
crimson
a
bald
gentleman
rather
fat
with
a
piece
of
toast
in
one
hand
and
a
glass
of
something
in
the
other
peter
had
expected
he
knew
not
what
something
stern
and
terrible
something
that
would
have
answered
in
one
way
or
another
to
those
early
recollections
of
terror
and
punishment
that
still
dwelt
with
him
he
had
remembered
his
father
as
short
spare
grim
pale
this
gentleman
who
was
now
watching
him
bulged
in
the
cheeks
and
the
stomach
was
highly
coloured
with
purple
veins
down
the
sides
of
his
nose
and
his
rather
podgy
hands
trembled
nevertheless
it
was
his
father
when
the
red
spoke
it
was
in
a
kind
of
travesty
of
that
old
sharp
voice
those
cutting
icy
words
a
thickened
and
degenerate
relation
my
boy
at
last
the
gentleman
said
the
room
presented
disorder
on
the
table
were
scattered
playing
cards
a
chair
was
overturned
under
the
cactus
plant
lay
what
looked
like
a
fiddle
and
the
only
two
pictures
on
the
wall
were
very
indecent
old
drawings
taken
apparently
from
some
hogarthian
prints
peter
stared
at
all
this
in
amazement
it
was
after
the
grim
approach
and
the
deserted
garden
like
finding
an
easter
egg
in
a
strong
box
peter
saw
that
his
father
was
wearing
under
the
a
white
waistcoat
and
blue
trousers
both
of
them
stained
with
dark
stains
and
smelling
very
strongly
of
whisky
he
noticed
also
that
his
father
seemed
to
find
it
difficult
to
balance
himself
on
both
his
legs
at
the
same
time
and
that
he
was
continually
shifting
his
feet
in
an
indeterminate
kind
of
way
as
though
he
would
like
to
dance
but
felt
that
it
might
not
be
quite
the
thing
westcott
closed
up
both
his
eyes
opened
his
mouth
and
shut
it
again
and
shook
peter
excitedly
by
the
hand
at
the
same
time
peter
felt
that
his
father
was
shaking
his
hand
as
much
because
he
wanted
to
hold
on
to
something
as
for
reasons
of
courtesy
well
i
am
glad
i
wondered
when
you
would
come
to
see
your
poor
old
father
again
after
all
these
years
i
often
thought
of
you
and
said
to
myself
he
come
back
one
day
you
only
be
patient
said
to
myself
your
son
will
come
back
to
you
your
only
son
and
it
is
likely
that
he
going
to
desert
you
altogether
yes
father
i
come
back
said
peter
releasing
his
hand
come
back
to
he
thought
of
the
many
times
in
london
when
he
pictured
his
father
stern
and
dark
pulling
the
wires
dragging
his
wicked
son
back
to
him
he
thought
of
that
and
now
this
and
yet
well
now
is
that
pleasant
you
come
to
stay
could
i
have
wanted
anything
better
come
and
sit
down
yes
that
chair
and
have
something
to
drink
what
you
wo
well
perhaps
later
so
you
come
to
keep
your
old
father
company
have
you
i
sure
that
delightful
just
what
a
son
ought
to
do
we
shall
get
along
very
well
i
all
the
while
that
his
father
talked
still
holding
the
toast
and
the
glass
of
something
peter
was
intensely
conscious
of
the
silent
listening
house
after
all
that
grimness
that
desertion
the
old
woman
warning
had
gone
for
something
and
yet
in
spite
of
a
kind
of
dread
that
hung
about
him
in
spite
of
a
kind
of
perception
that
there
was
a
great
deal
more
in
his
father
than
he
at
present
perceived
he
could
not
resist
a
kind
of
warm
pleasure
that
here
at
any
rate
was
some
sort
of
a
haven
that
no
one
else
in
the
world
might
want
him
but
here
was
some
one
who
was
glad
to
see
him
well
my
boy
tell
me
all
you
been
doing
these
i
been
in
london
writing
dear
dear
have
you
really
now
and
how
it
all
turned
out
dear
me
i
sorry
for
that
but
there
are
better
things
in
the
world
than
writing
believe
me
i
dare
say
my
boy
you
thought
me
unkind
in
those
old
days
but
it
was
all
for
your
best
oh
dear
me
yes
entirely
for
your
here
for
an
instant
his
father
voice
sounded
so
like
his
old
grandfather
that
peter
jumped
married
said
his
father
my
wife
has
left
me
dear
me
i
am
sorry
to
hear
westcott
finished
the
toast
and
wiped
his
fingers
on
a
very
old
and
dirty
red
handkerchief
women
bless
them
angels
for
a
time
but
never
to
be
depended
on
poor
boy
i
sorry
children
i
had
a
son
he
well
now
i
am
indeed
sorry
i
have
liked
a
grandson
too
do
want
the
old
westcott
stock
to
die
out
dear
me
that
is
a
it
was
at
this
point
that
peter
was
aware
although
he
could
not
have
given
any
reasonable
explanation
of
his
certainty
that
his
father
had
been
perfectly
assured
beforehand
of
all
the
answers
to
these
questions
peter
looked
at
the
man
but
the
eyes
were
almost
closed
and
the
smile
that
played
about
the
weak
lips
once
so
stern
and
strong
told
one
nothing
it
was
dark
now
westcott
got
somewhat
unsteadily
to
his
feet
come
he
said
i
show
you
the
house
my
boy
not
changed
much
since
you
were
here
i
sure
wanted
a
woman
care
since
your
dear
mother
died
of
course
and
your
poor
old
grandfather
he
whispered
over
again
to
himself
as
he
shuffled
across
the
room
your
poor
old
grandfather
it
had
seemed
to
grow
very
suddenly
dark
outside
in
the
hall
under
the
spluttering
lamp
westcott
found
a
candle
the
house
was
intensely
silent
as
they
climbed
the
stairs
lighted
only
by
the
flickering
peter
feelings
were
a
curious
mixture
of
uneasiness
and
a
strange
unthinking
somnolence
some
part
of
him
somewhere
was
urging
him
to
an
active
unrest
norah
what
does
she
want
interfering
i
just
go
and
see
her
and
come
back
no
i
wo
i
just
stay
here
never
to
bother
again
never
to
bother
again
he
was
also
in
some
undefined
way
expecting
that
at
any
moment
his
father
would
change
the
crimson
swayed
under
the
flickering
let
it
turn
round
and
what
would
one
see
inside
it
his
father
never
stopped
talking
for
an
instant
his
thick
wandering
voice
was
the
only
sound
in
the
deserted
house
the
rooms
were
all
empty
they
smelt
as
though
the
windows
had
not
been
opened
for
years
it
was
in
the
little
room
that
had
once
been
his
bedroom
that
the
apples
were
stored
piles
upon
piles
of
them
and
most
of
them
rotten
the
smell
was
all
over
the
house
westcott
standing
with
the
apples
on
every
side
of
him
flung
monstrous
shadows
upon
the
wall
this
used
to
be
your
room
i
remember
i
used
to
whip
you
here
when
you
were
disobedient
the
only
way
to
bring
up
your
child
the
westcotts
have
always
believed
in
it
dear
me
how
long
ago
it
all
seems
you
can
have
this
room
again
if
you
like
any
room
in
the
house
you
please
we
be
very
good
company
for
one
another
all
about
peter
there
was
an
atmosphere
of
extraordinary
languor
just
to
sit
here
and
let
the
days
slip
by
the
years
pass
just
to
stay
here
with
no
one
to
hurt
one
no
need
for
courage
they
were
out
in
the
long
passage
westcott
came
and
placed
his
hand
upon
peter
arm
the
whole
house
was
a
great
cool
place
where
one
slept
westcott
smiled
into
peter
face
the
house
was
silent
and
dark
and
oh
so
restful
the
candle
swelled
to
an
enormous
size
the
red
seemed
to
enfold
peter
in
another
moment
he
would
have
fallen
asleep
there
where
he
stood
with
the
last
struggle
of
a
drowning
man
he
pulled
back
his
fading
senses
i
must
go
back
to
the
hotel
and
fetch
my
he
could
see
his
father
eyes
that
had
been
wide
open
disappear
we
can
send
for
no
i
must
go
for
them
myself
for
a
moment
they
faced
one
another
he
wondered
what
his
father
intended
to
do
then
with
a
genial
laugh
westcott
said
well
my
boy
just
as
you
please
just
as
you
please
i
know
you
come
back
to
your
old
father
i
know
you
come
back
he
blew
the
candle
out
and
put
his
arm
through
his
son
and
they
went
downstairs
together
chapter
iii
norah
monogue
i
peter
found
next
morning
miss
monogue
sitting
by
her
window
she
gave
him
at
once
the
impression
of
something
kept
alive
by
a
so
determined
that
death
himself
could
only
stand
aside
and
wait
until
it
might
waver
she
was
so
thin
that
sitting
there
in
the
clear
white
colours
of
the
sky
beyond
her
window
she
seemed
like
fine
silk
something
that
at
an
instant
breath
would
be
swept
like
a
shadow
into
the
air
she
wore
something
loose
and
white
and
over
her
shoulders
there
was
a
grey
shawl
her
grey
hair
was
as
untidy
as
of
old
escaping
from
the
order
that
it
had
been
intended
to
keep
and
falling
over
her
beautiful
eyes
so
that
continually
she
moved
her
hand
so
thin
and
white
with
its
deep
purple
veins
to
push
it
back
in
this
still
white
figure
the
eyes
burnt
with
an
amazing
fire
what
eyes
they
were
one
seemed
in
the
old
days
to
have
denied
them
their
proper
splendour
but
now
in
this
swiftly
fading
body
they
had
gathered
more
life
and
vigour
showing
the
soul
that
triumphed
over
so
slender
a
mortality
she
seemed
to
peter
as
he
came
into
the
room
to
stand
for
so
much
more
than
he
had
ever
hitherto
allowed
her
here
in
her
last
furious
struggle
to
keep
a
life
that
had
given
to
her
nothing
worth
having
he
saw
suddenly
emblazoned
about
him
the
part
that
she
had
played
in
his
life
always
from
the
first
moment
that
he
had
known
her
a
part
that
had
been
by
him
so
frequently
neglected
so
frequently
denied
as
she
turned
and
saw
him
he
was
ashamed
at
the
joy
that
his
coming
so
obviously
brought
her
he
felt
her
purity
her
unselfishness
her
her
courage
her
nobility
in
that
triumphant
welcome
that
she
gave
him
that
she
should
care
so
much
for
any
one
so
worthless
so
fruitless
as
he
had
proved
himself
to
be
he
had
come
to
her
with
some
dim
sense
that
it
was
kind
of
him
to
visit
her
he
advanced
to
her
now
across
the
room
with
a
consciousness
that
she
was
honouring
him
by
receiving
him
at
all
that
joy
with
which
she
had
at
first
greeted
him
had
in
it
also
something
of
surprise
he
had
forgotten
how
greatly
these
last
terrible
days
must
have
altered
his
appearance
he
told
much
more
than
he
knew
and
the
little
sad
attempt
that
he
made
as
he
came
to
her
to
present
as
careless
and
happy
an
appearance
as
he
had
presented
in
the
old
brockett
days
was
more
pathetic
and
betraying
than
anything
he
could
have
done
but
she
just
closed
both
her
burning
hands
about
his
cold
one
made
him
sit
down
in
a
chair
by
her
side
and
trembling
with
the
excited
joy
of
having
him
with
her
forced
him
to
determine
that
whatever
came
of
it
he
would
keep
his
troubles
from
her
would
let
her
know
nothing
of
his
old
chuckling
father
and
the
shadowy
welcome
that
scaw
house
had
flung
over
him
would
be
still
the
peter
that
he
had
been
when
he
had
seen
her
last
in
london
peter
how
splendid
to
have
you
here
when
bannister
told
me
last
night
i
could
have
cried
for
happiness
and
he
dear
little
man
was
surely
as
pleased
to
see
me
happy
as
though
i
been
his
own
i
just
come
down
peter
began
trying
to
smile
and
conscious
with
an
alarm
that
surprised
him
of
her
fragility
and
the
way
that
her
hand
went
now
and
again
to
her
breast
as
though
to
relieve
some
pain
there
are
you
sure
he
broke
off
that
i
not
doing
you
harm
coming
like
this
not
agitating
you
too
much
not
exciting
you
harm
why
peter
she
was
smiling
but
he
noticed
too
that
her
eyes
were
searching
his
face
as
though
to
find
some
clue
to
the
change
that
they
saw
there
why
it
all
the
good
in
the
world
it
what
i
been
wanting
all
this
time
some
change
a
little
excitement
for
i
been
here
you
know
quite
a
number
of
weeks
alone
and
that
it
should
be
you
you
of
all
people
in
this
lovely
exciting
surprising
how
did
it
happen
he
asked
your
coming
down
after
i
saw
you
last
i
was
very
bad
my
stupid
old
heart
and
the
doctor
said
that
i
must
get
away
to
the
sea
or
somewhere
then
what
do
you
think
the
dears
all
of
them
in
brockett
put
their
heads
together
and
got
me
quite
a
lot
of
money
oh
the
darlings
and
they
just
as
poor
as
church
mice
themselves
of
course
i
could
insult
them
by
not
taking
it
they
have
been
hurt
for
ever
so
i
just
pocketed
my
pride
and
came
down
why
treliss
asked
peter
well
had
you
so
often
talked
about
it
always
i
connected
you
with
it
in
my
mind
and
thought
that
one
day
i
come
down
and
see
it
i
suggested
it
to
the
doctor
he
said
it
was
the
very
place
i
used
to
hope
that
one
day
you
be
with
me
here
to
explain
it
but
i
never
expected
it
not
so
soon
not
like
her
voice
faltered
a
little
and
her
hand
held
his
more
tightly
they
were
silent
the
sounds
of
the
world
came
muffled
up
to
their
window
but
they
were
only
conscious
of
one
another
peter
knew
that
in
another
instant
he
would
tell
her
everything
he
had
always
told
her
everything
that
is
what
she
had
been
there
for
some
one
like
an
elder
sister
to
whom
he
might
go
and
confess
at
last
it
came
very
softly
she
asked
him
peter
what
the
matter
why
are
you
here
what
happened
staring
before
him
out
of
the
window
seeing
nothing
but
the
high
white
light
of
the
upper
sky
his
heart
as
it
seemed
to
him
lying
in
his
hands
like
a
stone
to
be
tossed
lightly
out
there
into
space
he
told
her
everything
happened
clare
has
run
off
with
my
best
friend
it
has
just
happened
like
that
i
do
blame
her
she
liked
him
better
but
i
did
know
it
was
going
to
he
did
look
at
her
but
he
heard
her
catch
her
breath
sharply
and
he
felt
her
hand
tighten
on
his
they
were
silent
for
a
long
time
and
he
was
dimly
aware
in
some
unanalysed
way
that
this
was
what
she
had
expected
ever
since
he
had
come
into
the
room
oh
she
said
at
last
holding
his
hand
very
tightly
i
sorry
sorry
he
had
seen
of
course
from
the
beginning
that
this
business
must
be
told
her
but
his
one
desire
was
to
hurry
through
it
to
get
it
done
and
banished
once
and
for
all
from
their
conversation
it
happened
he
went
on
gruffly
quite
suddenly
i
was
in
any
way
prepared
for
it
she
just
went
off
to
paris
after
leaving
a
letter
with
the
death
of
the
boy
and
the
failure
of
my
book
it
just
seemed
the
last
blow
the
the
end
at
thirty
she
said
softly
almost
to
herself
surely
no
with
the
pluck
that
you
got
and
the
health
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
all
to
do
he
smiled
bitterly
do
you
suppose
that
i
will
ask
her
to
come
back
to
me
do
you
suppose
that
i
want
her
back
no
that
all
done
with
all
that
life
then
he
added
slowly
not
looking
at
her
as
he
spoke
i
going
to
live
with
my
he
remembered
clearly
enough
that
he
had
told
her
many
things
about
his
early
life
at
scaw
house
he
knew
that
she
must
now
as
he
flung
that
piece
of
information
at
her
have
recalled
to
herself
all
those
things
that
he
had
told
her
he
felt
rather
than
perceived
the
agitation
that
seized
her
at
those
last
words
of
his
her
hand
slowly
withdrew
from
his
it
fell
back
on
to
her
lap
and
he
felt
her
whole
body
draw
as
it
were
into
itself
as
though
it
had
come
into
contact
with
some
terror
some
unexplained
alarm
but
she
only
said
and
what
will
you
do
at
home
peter
he
answered
her
with
a
kind
of
bravado
oh
write
i
suppose
i
went
up
to
see
the
old
man
yesterday
changed
enormously
since
the
old
days
i
found
him
quite
genial
seemed
very
anxious
that
i
should
come
i
expect
he
a
bit
she
did
not
answer
this
and
there
was
a
long
awkward
pause
he
knew
as
they
sat
there
in
troubled
silence
that
his
conscience
was
awake
it
had
seemed
to
be
so
quiescent
through
his
visit
yesterday
it
had
been
drugged
and
dimmed
all
these
last
restless
days
but
now
it
was
up
again
he
was
conscious
that
it
was
not
after
all
going
to
be
so
easy
a
thing
to
abandon
all
his
energies
his
militancies
the
dominant
vigorous
panoply
of
his
soul
he
knew
as
he
sat
there
that
this
sick
shadow
of
a
woman
would
not
let
him
go
like
that
he
said
to
her
for
the
moment
but
as
he
left
the
room
he
knew
that
scaw
house
would
not
see
him
again
until
he
had
done
everything
for
her
that
there
was
to
be
done
ii
that
evening
he
saw
the
doctor
who
attended
on
her
he
was
a
nice
young
fellow
intelligent
eager
with
a
very
real
individual
liking
for
his
patient
ah
she
splendid
brave
and
plucky
beyond
anything
i
ever
seen
so
full
of
fun
that
you
think
that
she
an
idea
that
another
three
weeks
would
see
her
as
well
as
ever
again
whereas
she
knows
as
well
as
i
do
that
another
three
weeks
may
easily
see
her
out
of
the
world
altogether
there
no
hope
then
asked
peter
none
whatever
there
every
kind
of
complication
she
must
have
always
had
something
the
matter
with
her
and
if
she
been
cared
for
and
nursed
when
she
was
younger
she
might
have
pulled
out
of
it
instead
of
that
she
always
worn
herself
to
a
thread
you
can
see
that
she
one
of
those
who
take
life
easily
she
ought
to
have
gone
before
this
but
she
holds
on
with
her
pluck
and
her
love
of
it
all
lord
when
one
thinks
of
the
millions
of
people
who
just
through
life
not
valuing
it
doing
nothing
with
it
one
grudges
the
waste
of
their
hours
when
a
woman
like
miss
monogue
could
have
done
so
much
with
am
i
doing
her
any
harm
going
in
to
see
her
no
doing
her
good
do
excite
her
too
much
otherwise
the
the
best
thing
in
the
world
for
the
days
then
were
to
be
dedicated
to
her
service
he
knew
of
course
that
at
the
end
of
it
and
the
end
could
not
be
far
distant
he
would
go
to
scaw
house
and
remain
there
meanwhile
the
thing
was
postponed
he
would
not
think
about
it
but
on
his
second
meeting
with
norah
monogue
he
saw
that
he
was
not
to
be
allowed
to
dismiss
it
he
found
her
sitting
still
by
her
window
she
was
flushed
now
with
a
little
colour
her
eyes
burning
with
a
more
determined
fire
than
ever
her
whole
body
expressing
a
dauntless
energy
the
sight
of
her
showed
him
that
there
was
to
be
battle
and
strangely
enough
he
found
that
there
was
something
in
himself
that
almost
welcomed
it
before
he
knew
where
he
was
he
found
that
he
was
out
to
defend
his
whole
life
the
first
thing
that
she
did
was
to
draw
from
him
a
minute
particular
account
of
all
that
had
happened
during
these
last
months
it
developed
into
a
defence
of
his
whole
married
life
as
though
he
had
been
pleading
before
a
jury
of
clare
friends
and
must
fight
to
prove
himself
no
blackguard
ah
do
i
know
that
i
made
a
mess
of
it
all
do
you
think
that
proud
of
myself
he
pleaded
with
her
honestly
i
can
not
see
where
as
far
as
clare
is
concerned
i
to
blame
she
did
understand
how
could
she
ever
have
understood
the
way
that
my
work
mattered
to
me
i
wanted
to
keep
it
and
i
wanted
to
keep
her
too
and
every
time
i
tried
to
keep
her
it
got
in
the
way
and
every
time
i
tried
to
keep
it
she
got
in
the
way
i
was
clever
enough
to
run
both
norah
nodded
her
head
but
there
was
more
than
that
life
has
always
been
rough
for
me
rough
from
the
beginning
when
my
father
used
to
whip
me
rough
at
school
rough
when
i
starved
in
london
roughest
of
all
when
young
stephen
died
i
wanted
to
make
something
out
of
it
and
i
suppose
the
easiest
way
seemed
to
me
to
make
it
romantic
this
place
you
know
was
always
in
my
bones
that
tower
down
in
the
market
place
old
tan
curiosity
shop
the
sea
these
were
the
things
that
kept
me
going
afterwards
in
london
it
was
the
same
things
were
hard
so
i
made
them
into
a
story
i
coloured
them
up
nothing
hurt
when
everything
was
romance
i
made
clare
romance
too
that
was
the
way
you
see
that
all
my
life
was
bound
up
so
closely
together
she
was
an
adventure
just
as
everything
else
had
been
and
she
did
like
it
she
could
understand
the
adventure
point
of
view
it
was
to
her
immoral
indecent
i
went
easily
along
and
then
one
day
all
the
romance
went
out
of
it
clean
like
a
pricked
bubble
when
young
stephen
died
i
suddenly
saw
that
life
was
real
naked
ugly
not
romantic
a
bit
then
it
all
fell
to
pieces
like
a
house
of
cards
it
easy
enough
to
be
brave
when
you
attacking
a
cardboard
castle
it
when
you
up
against
iron
that
your
courage
is
wanted
it
failed
me
i
funked
it
i
going
to
run
he
could
see
that
norah
monogue
whole
life
was
in
the
vigour
with
which
she
opposed
him
no
no
no
to
give
it
up
now
why
you
only
thirty
everything
in
front
of
you
listen
i
know
you
took
clare
crookedly
i
saw
it
in
the
beginning
in
the
first
place
you
loved
her
but
you
loved
her
wrong
you
been
a
boy
peter
all
the
time
and
you
always
loved
like
a
boy
do
you
know
that
there
nothing
drives
a
woman
who
loves
a
man
more
to
desperation
than
that
that
man
should
give
her
a
boy
love
she
rather
he
hated
her
clare
could
have
been
dealt
with
to
begin
with
she
loved
you
all
the
time
oh
yes
i
as
certain
of
it
as
i
can
be
of
anything
i
know
her
so
well
but
the
unhappiness
the
discomfort
all
the
things
the
ugly
things
that
her
mother
was
emphasising
to
her
all
the
time
frightened
her
knowing
nothing
about
life
she
just
felt
that
things
as
they
were
were
as
bad
as
things
could
be
it
seems
extraordinary
that
any
one
so
timid
as
she
should
dare
to
take
so
dangerous
a
plunge
as
running
off
to
another
man
but
it
was
just
because
she
knew
so
little
about
life
that
she
could
do
it
this
other
man
persuaded
her
that
he
could
give
her
the
peace
and
comfort
that
you
could
she
does
know
poor
thing
poor
thing
what
it
will
mean
that
plunge
so
out
of
very
terror
she
took
it
and
now
oh
peter
i
as
certain
as
though
i
could
see
her
already
longing
for
you
would
give
anything
to
get
back
to
you
this
has
taught
her
more
than
all
the
rest
of
her
life
put
together
she
was
difficult
selfish
frightened
at
any
trouble
supersensitive
but
a
man
would
have
understood
her
you
wanted
affection
peter
from
her
from
me
from
a
lot
of
people
but
it
was
always
because
of
the
things
that
it
was
going
to
bring
to
you
never
because
of
the
things
that
you
were
going
to
give
out
you
never
grown
up
never
and
now
when
suddenly
the
real
world
has
come
to
you
you
going
to
give
it
i
do
give
it
up
he
said
to
her
i
shall
write
i
shall
do
things
she
shook
her
head
you
told
me
i
know
what
that
then
almost
below
her
breath
it
horrible
it
horrible
you
must
do
it
you
must
go
back
to
london
you
must
go
back
but
at
that
he
rose
and
faced
her
no
he
said
i
will
not
i
given
the
other
things
a
chance
all
these
years
i
given
them
a
chance
i
stood
everything
and
at
the
end
everything
taken
away
from
me
what
shall
i
go
back
to
who
wants
me
who
cares
god
he
cried
standing
there
almost
defying
her
why
should
i
go
just
to
fail
again
to
suffer
all
that
again
to
have
them
take
everything
i
love
from
me
again
to
be
broken
again
no
let
them
break
the
others
i
done
with
it
and
the
others
she
answered
him
is
it
to
be
always
yourself
fought
for
your
own
hand
and
they
beaten
you
to
your
knees
fight
now
for
something
finer
she
seemed
as
she
appealed
to
him
to
be
shining
with
some
great
conquering
purpose
here
with
her
poor
body
broken
and
torn
her
spirit
the
purer
for
her
physical
pain
confronted
him
shamed
him
stretched
like
a
flaming
sword
before
the
mean
paths
that
his
own
soul
would
follow
but
he
beat
her
down
i
will
not
go
back
you
do
know
you
understand
i
will
not
iii
the
little
dusty
minstrels
gallery
saw
a
good
deal
of
him
during
these
days
it
was
a
lonely
place
at
the
top
of
the
hotel
once
intended
to
be
picturesque
and
romantic
for
london
visitors
but
ultimately
left
to
its
own
company
with
its
magnificent
view
appreciated
by
no
one
here
peter
came
every
part
of
him
now
seemed
to
be
at
war
with
every
other
part
had
he
gone
straight
to
scaw
house
with
bag
and
baggage
and
never
left
it
again
then
the
westcott
tradition
might
have
caught
him
when
he
was
in
that
numbed
condition
caught
him
and
held
him
now
he
had
stayed
away
just
long
enough
for
all
the
old
peter
to
have
become
alive
and
active
again
he
looked
back
upon
london
with
a
great
shuddering
the
torment
that
he
had
suffered
there
he
must
never
undergo
again
norah
was
now
the
one
friend
left
to
him
in
the
world
he
would
cut
himself
into
pieces
to
make
these
last
days
of
hers
happy
and
yet
the
one
thing
that
could
give
her
happiness
was
that
he
should
promise
to
go
back
she
did
not
understand
no
one
could
understand
the
way
that
this
place
this
life
that
he
contemplated
pulled
him
the
slackness
of
it
the
lack
of
discipline
in
it
the
absence
of
struggle
in
it
all
the
strength
the
fighting
that
had
been
in
him
during
these
past
years
was
driven
out
of
him
now
he
just
wanted
to
let
things
drift
to
wander
about
the
fields
and
roads
to
find
his
clothes
growing
shabby
upon
him
to
grow
old
without
knowing
even
that
he
was
alive
all
this
had
come
to
him
she
on
the
other
side
would
drive
him
back
into
the
battle
of
it
all
once
more
to
go
back
a
failure
to
be
pointed
out
as
the
man
whose
wife
left
him
because
she
found
him
so
dull
to
hear
men
like
young
percival
galleon
laughing
at
his
book
to
sell
his
soul
for
journalism
in
order
to
make
a
living
to
see
perhaps
clare
come
back
into
the
london
world
to
break
out
ultimately
when
he
was
sick
and
tired
of
it
all
into
every
kind
of
debauch
how
much
better
to
slip
into
nothing
down
here
where
nobody
knew
nor
cared
and
yet
on
the
other
hand
he
had
never
known
until
now
the
importance
that
norah
monogue
had
held
in
his
life
always
in
everything
he
had
done
in
his
ambitions
and
despairs
his
triumphs
and
defeats
she
had
been
behind
him
he
just
do
anything
in
the
world
for
her
anything
except
this
one
thing
up
and
down
up
and
down
he
paced
the
little
minstrels
room
with
its
dusty
green
chair
and
its
shining
floor
i
just
ca
stand
it
all
over
again
but
every
time
that
he
went
in
to
see
her
and
he
was
with
her
continually
made
his
resistance
harder
she
did
speak
about
it
again
but
he
knew
that
she
was
always
thinking
about
it
she
worrying
over
something
westcott
do
you
happen
to
know
what
it
is
the
doctor
asked
him
it
bad
for
her
if
you
can
help
her
about
it
in
any
way
the
strain
between
them
was
becoming
unbearable
every
day
when
he
went
in
to
sit
with
her
they
would
talk
about
other
things
about
everything
but
he
knew
that
before
her
eyes
there
was
that
picture
of
himself
up
at
scaw
house
and
of
the
years
passing
and
his
soul
and
everything
that
was
fine
in
him
dying
he
saw
her
growing
daily
weaker
sometimes
he
felt
that
he
must
run
away
altogether
go
up
to
scaw
house
and
leave
her
to
die
alone
then
he
knew
that
that
cruelty
at
any
rate
was
not
in
him
one
day
he
thought
her
brutal
and
interfering
another
day
it
seemed
that
it
was
he
who
was
the
tyrant
he
reminded
himself
of
all
the
things
that
she
had
done
for
him
all
the
things
and
he
could
not
grant
her
this
one
request
then
he
would
ask
himself
what
the
devil
her
right
was
that
she
should
order
his
life
in
this
way
everyday
the
struggle
grew
harder
the
tension
could
not
hold
any
longer
at
last
it
broke
iv
one
evening
they
were
sitting
in
silence
beside
her
window
the
room
was
in
dusk
and
he
could
just
see
her
white
shadow
against
the
dim
blue
light
beyond
the
window
suddenly
she
broke
down
he
could
hear
her
crying
behind
her
hands
the
sound
in
that
grey
silent
room
was
more
than
he
could
bear
he
went
over
to
her
and
put
his
arms
round
her
norah
norah
please
please
it
so
awfully
bad
for
you
i
to
come
if
i
she
pulled
herself
together
her
voice
was
quite
calm
and
controlled
sit
over
there
peter
i
got
to
talk
to
he
went
back
to
his
chair
i
only
got
a
few
more
weeks
to
live
i
know
it
perhaps
only
a
few
more
days
i
must
make
the
very
utmost
of
my
time
i
got
to
save
you
he
said
nothing
oh
i
know
that
it
must
all
have
seemed
to
you
abominable
as
though
i
were
making
use
of
this
illness
of
mine
to
extort
a
promise
from
you
as
though
just
because
i
weak
and
feeble
i
can
hold
an
advantage
over
you
oh
i
know
it
all
abominable
but
i
use
everything
yes
simply
everything
if
i
can
get
you
to
leave
this
place
and
go
back
he
could
feel
that
she
was
pulling
herself
together
for
some
tremendous
effort
peter
i
want
you
now
just
to
think
of
me
to
put
yourself
out
of
everything
absolutely
just
for
this
after
all
as
i
only
a
few
left
i
got
that
her
laugh
as
she
said
it
was
one
of
the
saddest
things
he
ever
heard
now
i
going
to
tell
you
something
something
that
i
never
thought
i
tell
a
soul
i
not
had
a
very
cheerful
life
it
has
had
very
much
to
make
it
bright
and
interesting
i
not
complaining
but
it
just
been
that
way
she
broke
off
for
a
moment
i
do
want
you
to
interrupt
or
say
anything
it
make
it
easier
for
me
if
i
can
just
talk
out
into
the
night
air
as
it
were
just
as
though
no
one
were
she
went
on
the
one
thing
that
made
it
possible
made
it
bearable
made
it
alive
has
been
my
love
for
you
always
from
the
first
moment
i
saw
you
i
have
loved
you
oh
i
have
been
foolish
about
it
i
knew
that
you
never
care
for
me
in
that
kind
of
way
i
knew
from
the
very
first
that
we
should
be
pals
but
that
you
never
dream
of
anything
more
romantic
i
never
had
any
one
in
love
with
me
i
not
the
kind
of
woman
who
draws
the
romance
out
of
men
no
i
knew
you
never
love
me
but
i
just
determined
that
i
make
you
your
career
your
success
the
pivot
the
centre
of
my
life
i
was
blind
about
you
not
a
bit
i
knew
that
you
were
selfish
weak
incredibly
young
about
the
world
i
knew
that
you
were
the
last
person
in
existence
to
marry
clare
all
the
more
reason
it
seemed
to
me
why
i
should
be
behind
you
i
was
behind
you
so
much
more
than
you
ever
knew
i
wonder
if
you
the
least
idea
what
most
women
lives
are
like
they
come
into
the
world
with
the
finest
ideals
the
most
tremendous
energies
with
a
desire
for
that
a
man
even
begin
to
understand
then
they
discover
slowly
that
none
of
those
things
those
ideals
those
energies
those
sacrifices
are
wanted
the
world
just
does
need
them
they
might
as
well
never
have
been
born
do
you
suppose
i
enjoyed
slaving
for
my
mother
day
and
night
for
years
do
you
suppose
that
i
gladly
yielded
up
all
my
best
blood
my
vitality
to
the
pleasure
of
some
one
who
never
valued
it
never
even
knew
that
such
things
were
being
given
her
before
you
came
i
was
slowly
falling
into
despair
think
of
all
the
women
who
are
haunted
by
the
awful
thought
time
will
come
when
death
will
be
facing
me
and
i
shall
be
forced
to
own
that
for
any
place
that
i
have
ever
filled
in
the
world
i
might
never
have
been
born
how
many
women
are
there
who
do
not
pray
every
day
of
their
lives
give
me
something
to
do
before
i
die
some
place
to
fill
some
work
to
carry
out
something
to
save
my
i
tell
you
that
there
is
a
time
coming
when
women
will
force
those
things
that
are
in
them
upon
the
world
god
help
all
poor
women
who
are
not
wanted
was
wanted
there
was
nothing
for
me
to
do
no
place
for
me
to
fill
then
you
came
at
once
i
seized
upon
seemed
to
have
sent
it
to
me
i
believed
that
if
i
turned
all
those
energies
those
desires
those
ambitions
upon
you
that
it
would
help
you
to
do
the
things
that
you
were
meant
to
do
i
was
with
you
always
i
slaved
for
you
you
became
the
end
in
life
to
which
i
had
been
called
all
the
time
you
were
only
a
boy
that
was
partly
i
think
why
i
loved
you
you
were
so
gauche
so
ignorant
so
violent
so
confident
one
moment
so
plunged
into
despair
the
next
for
a
while
everything
seemed
to
go
well
i
had
thought
that
clare
was
going
to
be
good
for
you
was
going
to
make
you
unselfish
i
thought
that
you
got
the
better
of
all
that
part
of
you
that
was
your
inheritance
even
when
i
came
down
here
i
thought
that
all
was
well
i
knew
that
i
had
come
down
to
die
and
i
had
thanked
god
because
he
after
all
allowed
me
to
make
something
of
my
life
that
i
been
able
to
see
you
lifted
into
success
that
seen
you
start
a
splendid
career
then
you
came
and
i
knew
that
your
life
was
broken
into
pieces
i
knew
that
what
had
happened
to
you
might
be
the
most
splendid
thing
in
the
world
for
you
and
might
be
the
most
terrible
if
you
stay
down
here
now
with
your
father
then
you
are
done
for
you
are
done
for
and
my
life
has
after
all
gone
for
her
voice
broke
then
she
leaned
forward
catching
his
hands
peter
i
dying
i
going
if
you
will
only
have
it
you
can
take
me
and
when
i
am
gone
i
shall
still
live
on
in
you
let
me
give
you
everything
that
is
best
in
me
let
me
feel
that
i
have
sent
you
back
to
london
sent
you
with
my
dying
breath
and
that
you
go
back
not
because
of
yourself
but
because
of
everything
that
you
can
do
for
every
one
else
believe
me
peter
dear
it
all
matters
so
little
this
trouble
and
unhappiness
that
you
had
if
you
take
it
bravely
the
courage
that
you
wanted
before
is
nothing
to
the
courage
that
you
want
now
if
you
going
back
let
me
die
knowing
that
we
both
going
back
think
of
what
your
life
if
it
fine
enough
can
mean
to
other
people
go
back
to
be
battered
never
mind
what
happens
to
your
body
any
one
can
stand
that
there
london
waiting
for
you
there
life
and
adventure
and
hardship
there
are
people
to
be
helped
you
go
with
all
that
i
can
give
you
behind
you
you
go
peter
he
sat
with
his
teeth
set
staring
out
into
the
world
he
had
known
from
the
first
sentence
of
her
appeal
to
him
that
she
had
named
the
one
thing
that
could
give
him
courage
to
fight
his
cowardice
some
one
had
once
said
if
any
one
soul
of
us
is
all
the
world
this
world
and
the
next
to
any
other
soul
then
whoever
it
may
be
that
thus
loves
us
the
inadequacy
of
our
return
the
hopeless
debt
of
us
must
strike
us
to
our
knees
with
an
utter
so
did
he
feel
now
out
of
the
wreck
there
had
survived
this
one
thing
he
remembered
what
henry
galleon
had
once
said
about
fortitude
that
the
hardest
trial
of
all
to
bear
was
the
consciousness
of
having
missed
the
finest
thing
all
these
years
she
had
been
there
by
the
side
of
him
and
he
had
scarcely
thought
of
her
now
even
as
he
watched
her
she
was
slipping
away
from
him
and
soon
he
would
be
left
alone
with
the
consciousness
of
missing
the
greatest
chance
of
his
life
the
one
thing
that
he
could
do
in
return
was
to
give
her
what
she
asked
but
it
was
hard
he
was
under
no
illusion
as
to
the
desperate
determination
that
it
would
demand
the
supreme
moment
of
his
life
had
come
for
the
first
time
he
was
going
to
fling
away
the
old
peter
westcott
altogether
he
could
feel
it
clinging
to
him
about
him
in
the
air
spirits
were
fighting
he
had
never
before
needed
courage
as
he
was
needing
it
now
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
to
stand
up
to
all
the
devils
in
the
world
they
were
thick
on
every
side
of
him
then
with
a
great
uplifting
of
strength
with
a
courage
that
he
had
never
known
before
he
picked
up
peter
westcott
in
his
hands
held
him
that
miserable
figure
high
in
air
raised
him
then
flung
him
with
all
his
strength
out
away
far
into
space
never
to
return
never
to
encumber
the
earth
again
i
go
back
peter
said
and
as
he
said
it
there
was
no
elation
in
him
only
a
vision
of
a
life
of
struggle
toil
torment
defeat
in
front
of
him
something
so
hard
and
arduous
that
the
new
peter
westcott
that
had
now
been
born
seemed
small
indeed
to
face
it
but
nevertheless
he
knew
that
at
the
moment
that
he
said
those
words
he
had
broken
into
pieces
the
spell
that
had
been
over
him
for
so
many
years
that
beast
in
him
that
had
troubled
him
for
so
long
all
the
dark
shadows
of
scaw
house
these
were
at
an
end
he
felt
tired
discouraged
no
fine
creature
as
he
turned
to
her
but
he
knew
that
from
that
moment
a
new
life
had
begun
for
him
he
put
his
arms
round
norah
monogue
and
kissed
her
v
he
got
up
very
early
next
morning
and
went
down
to
the
harbour
the
were
coming
in
great
flocks
of
gulls
waiting
for
the
spoil
that
was
soon
to
be
theirs
were
wheeling
in
clouds
about
the
brown
sails
the
boats
stole
one
after
another
around
the
pier
the
air
was
filled
with
shrill
cries
the
only
other
sound
was
the
lapping
of
the
water
as
it
curled
up
the
little
beach
as
peter
stood
there
there
crept
upon
him
a
sensation
of
awe
he
took
off
his
hat
the
gulls
seemed
to
cease
their
cries
as
another
brown
sail
stole
round
the
white
point
gleaming
now
in
the
sun
he
knew
with
absolute
certainty
that
norah
monogue
was
dead
chapter
iv
the
grey
hill
i
the
day
of
norah
monogue
funeral
was
fine
and
clear
peter
and
little
bannister
were
the
only
mourners
and
it
was
peter
wish
that
she
should
be
buried
in
the
little
windy
graveyard
of
the
church
where
his
mother
had
been
buried
there
was
always
a
wind
on
that
little
hill
but
it
was
gentler
than
he
had
ever
known
it
before
his
mind
went
back
to
that
other
funeral
now
as
it
seemed
such
a
lifetime
ago
out
of
all
the
world
these
two
women
only
now
seemed
to
abide
with
him
as
he
stood
beside
the
grave
he
was
conscious
that
there
was
about
him
a
sense
of
peace
and
rest
such
as
he
had
never
known
before
could
it
be
true
that
some
of
norah
monogue
fine
spirit
had
come
to
him
were
they
in
sober
fact
to
go
on
together
during
the
remainder
of
his
days
he
lingered
for
a
little
looking
down
upon
the
grave
he
was
glad
to
think
that
he
had
made
her
last
hours
happy
indeed
she
had
not
lived
in
vain
ii
heavy
black
clouds
were
banking
upon
the
horizon
as
he
went
down
the
hill
and
struck
the
sea
road
in
the
direction
of
scaw
house
except
in
that
far
distance
the
sky
was
a
relentless
changeless
blue
every
detail
in
the
scene
was
marked
with
a
hard
outline
every
sound
the
sea
the
bell
rock
the
cries
of
sheep
the
nestling
trees
was
doubly
insistent
he
banged
the
knocker
upon
the
scaw
house
door
and
when
the
old
woman
came
to
open
to
him
he
saw
that
something
had
occurred
her
hair
fell
about
her
neck
her
face
was
puckered
with
distress
and
her
whole
appearance
was
dismayed
is
my
father
in
he
asked
he
is
but
he
ill
she
answered
him
eyeing
him
doubtfully
he
wo
know
yer
i
doubt
he
know
any
one
he
had
a
great
peter
pushed
past
her
into
the
hall
is
he
ill
indeed
he
is
he
was
suddenly
took
the
other
evenin
i
being
in
my
kitchen
heard
a
great
cry
i
came
runnin
and
there
in
the
i
found
him
standing
there
in
the
midst
his
hands
up
his
eyes
you
must
understand
sir
were
wide
and
staring
beaten
me
he
cried
beaten
me
just
like
that
sir
and
then
down
he
tumbled
in
a
living
fit
foaming
at
the
mouth
and
striking
his
poor
head
against
the
fender
yer
may
come
up
sir
but
he
wo
know
yer
which
he
does
me
peter
followed
her
up
to
the
dreary
room
that
his
father
inhabited
even
here
the
paper
was
peeling
off
the
walls
some
of
the
was
broken
and
the
carpet
was
torn
his
father
lay
on
his
back
in
an
old
high
his
eyes
stared
before
him
cheeks
were
ashen
white
his
hands
too
were
white
like
ivory
his
lips
moved
but
he
made
no
sound
he
did
not
see
peter
nor
did
his
eyes
turn
from
the
blank
stare
that
held
them
has
he
a
doctor
peter
asked
the
old
woman
ay
there
a
young
man
been
coming
the
old
woman
answered
him
she
was
he
noticed
more
subservient
than
she
had
been
on
the
former
occasion
she
obviously
turned
to
him
now
with
her
greedy
old
eyes
as
the
one
who
was
likely
soon
to
be
in
authority
peter
turned
back
to
the
door
this
room
must
be
made
warmer
and
more
comfortable
i
will
send
a
doctor
from
the
hotel
this
evening
i
will
come
in
again
as
he
looked
about
the
poor
room
as
he
saw
the
dust
that
the
sunlight
made
so
visible
he
wondered
that
the
house
of
cards
could
so
recently
have
held
him
within
its
shadow
he
felt
as
though
he
had
passed
through
some
terrible
nightmare
that
the
light
of
day
rendered
not
only
fantastic
but
incredible
that
old
peter
westcott
had
indeed
been
flung
out
of
the
high
window
of
norah
monogue
room
leaving
scaw
house
on
his
right
he
struck
through
the
dark
belt
of
trees
and
came
out
at
the
foot
of
the
grey
hill
the
dark
belt
of
cloud
was
spreading
now
fast
across
the
blue
soon
it
would
catch
the
sun
the
tower
itself
was
already
swallowed
by
a
cold
grey
shadow
peter
began
to
climb
the
hill
and
remembered
that
he
had
not
been
there
since
that
easter
morning
when
he
had
kissed
an
unknown
lady
and
so
flung
fine
omens
about
his
future
soon
he
had
reached
the
little
green
mound
that
lay
below
the
finger
although
the
grey
hill
would
have
been
small
and
insignificant
in
hilly
country
here
by
its
isolation
it
assumed
importance
on
every
side
of
it
ran
the
in
front
of
it
almost
as
it
seemed
up
to
its
very
feet
ran
the
sea
treliss
was
completely
hidden
not
a
house
could
be
seen
the
black
clouds
now
had
caught
the
sea
and
only
far
away
to
the
right
the
waves
still
glittered
for
the
rest
it
was
an
inky
grey
with
a
touch
of
white
here
and
there
where
submerged
rocks
found
breakers
for
one
moment
the
sun
had
still
evaded
the
cloud
then
it
was
caught
and
the
world
was
instantly
cold
peter
as
he
sat
there
felt
that
if
he
were
only
still
enough
the
silence
would
soon
be
vocal
the
hill
the
sea
the
sky
these
things
seemed
to
have
summoned
him
there
that
they
might
speak
to
him
he
was
utterly
detached
from
life
he
looked
down
from
a
height
in
air
and
saw
his
little
body
sitting
there
as
he
had
done
on
the
day
when
he
had
proposed
to
clare
he
might
think
now
of
the
long
journey
that
it
had
come
he
might
watch
the
course
of
its
little
history
see
the
full
circle
that
it
had
travelled
wonder
for
what
new
business
it
was
now
to
prepare
for
full
circle
he
had
come
he
peter
westcott
sat
there
as
naked
as
alone
as
barren
of
all
rewards
of
all
success
of
all
achievements
as
he
had
been
when
so
many
years
ago
he
had
watched
that
fight
in
the
inn
on
christmas
eve
the
scene
passed
before
him
again
he
saw
himself
a
tiny
boy
swinging
his
legs
from
the
high
chair
he
saw
the
room
thick
with
smoke
the
fishermen
dicky
the
fool
the
mistletoe
swinging
the
snow
blocking
in
from
outside
the
fight
it
was
all
as
though
it
passed
once
more
before
his
eyes
his
whole
life
came
to
him
the
scenes
at
scaw
house
dawson
the
bookshop
brockett
bucket
lane
chelsea
that
last
awful
scene
there
all
the
people
that
he
had
known
passed
before
him
stephen
brant
his
grandfather
his
father
his
mother
bobby
galleon
zanti
clare
cards
brockett
norah
henry
galleon
rossiter
dear
launce
these
and
many
more
he
could
see
them
all
dispassionately
now
how
that
other
peter
westcott
had
felt
their
contact
how
he
had
longed
for
their
friendship
dreaded
their
anger
missed
them
wanted
them
minded
their
desertion
now
behold
they
were
all
gone
alone
on
this
hill
with
the
great
sea
at
his
feet
with
the
storm
rolling
up
to
him
peter
westcott
thought
of
his
wife
and
his
son
his
friends
and
his
career
thought
of
everything
that
had
been
life
to
him
yes
even
his
sins
his
temptations
his
desires
for
the
beast
in
man
his
surly
temper
his
furious
anger
his
selfishness
his
lack
of
understanding
all
these
things
had
been
taken
away
from
him
every
trail
had
been
given
to
him
and
now
naked
on
a
hill
he
knew
the
first
peace
of
his
life
and
as
he
knew
sitting
there
that
thus
peace
had
come
to
him
how
odd
it
seemed
that
only
a
few
weeks
ago
he
had
been
coming
down
to
cornwall
with
his
soul
as
he
had
then
thought
killed
for
ever
the
world
had
seemed
utterly
absolutely
for
ever
at
an
end
and
now
here
he
was
sitting
here
eager
to
go
back
into
it
all
again
wanting
it
almost
seemed
to
be
bruised
and
battered
all
over
again
and
perceiving
this
showed
him
what
was
indeed
the
truth
that
all
his
life
had
been
only
boy
history
he
had
gone
up
he
had
gone
down
he
had
loved
and
hated
exulted
and
despaired
but
it
was
all
with
a
intense
realisation
of
the
moment
with
a
boy
swift
easy
transition
from
one
crisis
to
another
it
had
been
his
education
and
now
his
education
was
over
as
he
had
said
those
words
to
norah
monogue
i
will
go
back
he
had
become
a
man
never
again
would
life
be
so
utterly
over
as
it
had
been
two
months
ago
never
again
would
he
be
so
in
his
reserved
adoption
of
it
as
he
had
been
those
days
ago
at
norah
monogue
side
he
saw
that
always
through
everything
that
boy
peter
westcott
had
been
in
the
way
it
was
not
until
he
had
taken
on
that
day
in
norah
monogue
room
peter
westcott
in
his
hands
and
flung
him
to
the
four
winds
that
he
had
seen
how
terribly
in
the
way
he
had
been
go
back
norah
had
said
to
him
you
have
done
all
these
things
for
yourself
and
you
have
been
beaten
to
your
knees
go
back
now
and
do
something
for
others
you
have
been
brave
for
yourself
be
brave
now
for
and
he
was
going
back
he
was
going
back
as
he
had
seen
on
that
day
to
no
easy
life
he
was
going
to
take
up
all
those
links
that
had
been
so
difficult
for
him
before
he
was
going
to
learn
all
over
again
that
art
that
he
had
fancied
that
he
had
conquered
at
the
very
first
attempt
he
was
going
now
with
no
expectations
no
hopes
no
ambitions
life
was
still
an
adventure
but
now
an
adventure
of
a
hard
cruel
sort
something
that
needed
an
answer
grim
and
dark
the
storm
was
coming
up
apace
the
wind
had
risen
and
was
now
rushing
over
the
short
stiff
grass
bellowing
out
to
meet
the
sea
blowing
back
to
meet
the
clouds
that
raced
behind
the
hill
the
sky
was
black
with
clouds
peter
could
see
the
sand
rising
from
the
dunes
in
a
thin
mist
peter
flung
himself
upon
his
back
the
first
drops
of
rain
fell
cold
upon
his
face
then
he
heard
peter
westcott
peter
westcott
i
here
what
have
you
brought
to
us
here
i
have
brought
what
have
you
to
offer
us
i
can
offer
he
got
up
from
the
ground
and
faced
the
wind
he
put
his
back
to
the
giant
finger
because
of
the
force
of
the
gale
the
rain
was
coming
down
now
in
torrents
he
felt
a
great
exultation
surge
through
his
body
then
the
voice
not
in
the
rain
nor
the
wind
nor
the
sea
but
yet
all
of
these
and
coming
as
it
seemed
from
the
very
heart
of
the
hill
came
swinging
through
the
storm
have
you
cast
away
peter
westcott
and
this
that
also
and
this
this
also
and
this
i
have
flung
this
too
have
you
anything
now
about
you
that
you
treasure
i
have
friends
ties
ambitions
they
are
all
then
out
of
the
heart
of
the
storm
there
came
voices
blessed
be
pain
and
torment
and
every
torture
of
the
body
blessed
be
plague
and
pestilence
and
the
illness
of
nations
blessed
be
all
loss
and
the
failure
of
friends
and
the
sacrifice
of
love
blessed
be
the
destruction
of
all
possessions
the
ruin
of
all
property
fine
cities
and
great
palaces
blessed
be
the
disappointment
of
all
ambitions
blessed
be
all
failure
and
the
ruin
of
every
earthly
hope
blessed
be
all
sorrows
torments
hardships
endurances
that
demand
courage
blessed
be
these
things
for
of
these
things
cometh
the
making
of
a
man
peter
clinging
to
the
giant
finger
staggered
in
the
wind
the
world
was
hidden
now
in
a
mist
of
rain
he
was
alone
and
he
was
happy
happy
as
he
had
never
known
happiness
in
any
time
before
the
rain
lashed
his
face
and
his
body
his
clothes
clung
heavily
about
him
he
answered
the
storm
make
of
me
a
man
to
be
afraid
of
nothing
to
be
ready
for
everything
love
friendship
success
to
take
if
it
comes
to
care
nothing
if
these
things
are
not
for
me
make
me
brave
make
me
brave
he
fancied
that
once
more
against
the
wall
of
he
saw
tremendous
victorious
the
rider
on
the
lion
but
now
for
the
first
time
the
rider
face
was
turned
towards
him
