it
s
too
bad
that

can

see
this
i
exclaimed
as
my
eye
fell
on
the
following
item
from
mars
fail
to
reach
massachusetts
wednesday
the
harvard
college
radio
station
has
for
several
weeks
been
in
receipt
of
fragmentary
signals
of
extraordinarily
long
professor
hammond
announced
yesterday
so
far
as
it
has
been
possible
to
test
the
direction
of
the
source
of
these
waves
it
appears
that
the
direction
has
a
hour
cycle
thus
indicating
that
the
origin
of
these
waves
is
some
point
outside
the
university
authorities
will
express
no
opinion
as
to
whether
or
not
these
messages
come
from
myles
alone
of
all
the
radio
engineers
of
my
acquaintance
was
competent
to
surmount
these
difficulties
and
thus
enable
the
cambridge
savants
to
receive
with
clearness
the
message
from
another
planet
twelve
months
ago
he
would
have
been
available
for
he
was
then
quietly
visiting
at
my
farm
after
five
spent
on
the
planet
venus
where
by
the
aid
of
radio
he
had
led
the
cupians
to
victory
over
their
oppressors
a
race
of
gigantic
black
ants
he
had
driven
the
last
ant
from
the
face
of
continental
poros
and
had
won
and
wed
the
princess
lilla
who
had
borne
him
a
son
to
occupy
the
throne
of
cupia
while
at
my
farm
cabot
had
rigged
up
a
huge
radio
set
and
a
apparatus
with
which
he
had
presumably
shot
himself
back
to
poros
on
the
night
of
the
big
october
storm
which
had
wrecked
his
installation
i
showed
the
newspaper
item
to
farley
and
lamented
on
cabot
s
absence
her
response
opened
up
an
entirely
new
line
of
thought
said
she
doesn
t
the
very
fact
that
cabot
isn
t
here
suggest
to
you
that
this
may
be
a
message
not
from
mars
but
from
him
or
perhaps
from
the
princess
lilla
inquiring
about
him
in
case
he
has
failed
in
his
attempted
return
that
had
never
occurred
to
me
how
stupid
what
had
i
better
do
about
it
if
anything
i
asked
drop
professor
hammond
a
line
but
farley
was
afraid
that
i
would
be
taken
for
a
crank
that
evening
when
i
was
over
in
town
the
clerk
in
the
drug
store
waylaid
me
to
say
that
there
had
been
a
phone
call
for
me
and
would
i
please
call
a
certain
cambridge
number
so
after
waiting
an
interminable
time
in
the
stuffy
booth
with
my
hands
full
of
dimes
nickels
and
quarters
i
finally
got
my
party
mr
farley
this
is
professor
kellogg
kellogg
the
voice
replied
it
was
my
friend
of
the
harvard
math
faculty
the
man
who
had
analyzed
the
measurements
of
the
streamline
projectile
in
which
myles
cabot
had
shot
to
earth
the
account
of
the
first
part
of
his
adventures
on
venus
some
further
adventures
myles
had
told
me
in
person
during
his
stay
on
my
farm
professor
hammond
thinks
that
he
is
getting
mars
on
the
air
the
voice
continued
yes
i
replied
i
judged
as
much
from
what
i
read
in
this
morning
s
paper
but
what
do
think
kellogg
s
reply
gave
my
sluggish
mind
the
second
jolt
which
it
had
received
that
day
well
he
said
in
view
of
the
fact
that
i
am
one
of
the
few
people
among
your
readers
who
take
your
radio
stories
seriously
i
think
that
hammond
is
getting
venus
can
you
run
up
here
and
help
me
try
and
convince
him
and
so
it
was
that
i
took
the
early
boat
next
morning
for
boston
and
had
lunch
with
the
two
professors
as
a
result
of
our
conference
a
small
committee
of
engineers
returned
with
me
to
edgartown
that
evening
for
the
purpose
of
trying
to
repair
the
wrecked
radio
set
which
myles
cabot
had
left
on
my
farm
they
utterly
failed
to
comprehend
the
apparatus
and
the
fallen
tower
had
been
reerected
and
the
rubbish
cleared
had
devoted
their
attention
to
the
restoration
of
the
conversational
part
of
the
set
to
make
a
long
story
short
we
finally
restored
it
with
the
aid
of
some
old
blue
prints
of
cabot
s
which
farley
like
swiss
family
robinson
s
wife
produced
from
somewhere
i
was
the
first
to
try
the
earphones
and
was
rewarded
by
a
faint
like
the
song
of
a
north
woods
blackfly
in
conventional
radioese
i
repeated
the
sounds
to
the
harvard
group
dit
dit
dit
dah
dah
a
look
of
incredulity
spread
over
their
faces
again
came
the
same
message
and
again
i
repeated
it
you
re
spoofing
us
one
of
them
shouted
give
the
and
he
snatched
them
from
my
head
adjusting
them
on
his
own
head
he
spelled
out
to
us
seizing
the
big
he
threw
it
over
the
began
to
hum
grasping
the
key
the
harvard
engineer
ticked
off
into
space
cabot
cabot
cabot
has
this
station
a
call
letter
he
hurriedly
asked
me
yes
i
answered
quickly
he
continued
the
ticking
interplanetary
communication
was
an
established
fact
at
last
and
not
with
mars
after
all
these
years
of
scientific
speculations
but
what
meant
more
to
me
was
that
i
was
again
in
touch
with
my
classmate
myles
standish
cabot
the
radio
man
the
next
day
a
party
of
prominent
scientists
accompanied
by
a
telegrapher
and
two
stenographers
arrived
at
my
farm
during
the
weeks
that
followed
there
was
recorded
myles
s
own
account
of
the
amazing
adventures
on
the
planet
venus
or
poros
as
its
own
inhabitants
call
it
which
befell
him
upon
his
return
there
after
his
brief
visit
to
the
earth
i
have
edited
those
notes
into
the
following
coherent
story
ii
too
much
static
myles
cabot
had
returned
to
the
earth
to
study
the
latest
developments
of
modern
terrestrial
science
for
the
benefit
of
the
cupian
nation
he
was
the
regent
of
cupia
during
the
minority
of
his
baby
son
king
kew
the
thirteenth
the
loyal
prince
toron
occupied
the
throne
in
his
absence
the
last
of
the
and
their
ally
the
renegade
cupian
prince
yuri
had
presumably
perished
in
an
attempt
to
escape
by
flying
through
the
which
completely
hem
in
continental
poros
what
lay
beyond
the
boiling
seas
no
man
knew
during
his
stay
on
my
farm
cabot
had
built
the
apparatus
with
which
he
had
shot
himself
off
into
space
on
that
october
night
on
which
he
had
received
the
message
from
the
skies
s
o
s
a
thunderstorm
had
been
brewing
all
that
evening
and
just
as
myles
had
placed
himself
between
the
coordinate
axes
of
his
machine
and
had
gathered
up
the
strings
which
ran
from
his
control
levers
to
within
the
apparatus
there
had
come
a
blinding
flash
lightning
had
struck
his
aerial
how
long
his
unconsciousness
lasted
he
knew
not
he
was
some
time
in
regaining
his
senses
but
when
he
had
finally
and
fully
recovered
he
found
himself
lying
on
a
sandy
beach
beside
a
calm
and
placid
lake
beneath
a
silver
sky
he
fell
to
wondering
vaguely
and
pleasantly
where
he
was
and
how
he
had
got
here
suddenly
however
his
ears
were
jarred
by
a
familiar
sound
at
once
his
senses
cleared
and
he
listened
intently
to
the
distant
purring
of
a
motor
yes
there
could
be
no
mistake
an
airplane
was
approaching
now
he
could
see
it
a
speck
in
the
sky
far
down
the
beach
nearer
and
nearer
it
came
myles
sprang
to
his
feet
to
his
intense
surprise
he
found
that
the
effort
threw
him
quite
a
distance
into
the
air
instantly
the
idea
flashed
through
his
mind
i
must
be
on
mars
or
some
other
strange
this
idea
was
vaguely
reminiscent
of
something
but
while
he
was
trying
to
catch
this
vaguely
elusive
train
of
thought
his
attention
was
diverted
by
the
fact
that
for
some
unaccountable
reason
his
belt
buckle
and
most
of
the
buttons
which
had
held
his
clothes
together
were
missing
so
that
his
clothing
came
to
pieces
as
he
rose
and
that
he
had
to
shed
it
rapidly
in
order
to
avoid
impeding
his
movements
he
wondered
at
the
cause
of
this
but
his
speculations
were
cut
short
by
the
alighting
of
the
plane
a
hundred
yards
down
the
beach
what
was
his
horror
when
out
of
it
clambered
not
men
but
ants
ants
and
six
feet
high
huge
ants
four
of
them
running
toward
him
over
the
glistening
sands
gone
was
all
his
languor
as
he
seized
a
piece
of
driftwood
and
prepared
to
defend
himself
as
he
stood
thus
expectant
myles
realized
that
his
present
position
and
condition
the
surrounding
scenery
and
the
advance
of
the
were
exactly
item
for
item
like
the
opening
events
of
his
first
arrival
on
the
planet
poros
he
even
recognized
one
of
the
as
old
doggo
who
had
befriended
him
on
his
previous
visit
could
it
be
that
all
his
adventures
in
cupia
had
been
naught
but
a
dream
a
recurring
dream
in
fact
were
his
dear
wife
lilla
and
his
little
son
kew
merely
figments
of
his
imagination
horrible
thought
and
then
events
began
to
differ
from
those
of
the
past
for
the
three
other
formians
halted
and
doggo
advanced
alone
by
the
agitation
of
the
beast
s
antennae
the
earth
man
could
see
that
it
was
talking
to
him
but
myles
no
longer
possessed
the
wonderful
electrical
headset
which
he
had
contrived
and
built
during
his
previous
visit
to
that
planet
so
as
to
talk
with
cupians
and
formians
both
of
which
races
are
earless
and
converse
by
means
of
radiations
from
their
antennae
so
he
picked
up
two
sticks
from
the
beach
and
held
them
projecting
from
his
forehead
then
threw
them
to
the
ground
with
a
grimace
of
disgust
and
pointed
to
his
ears
doggo
understood
and
scratched
with
his
paw
in
cupian
shorthand
on
the
silver
sands
the
message
myles
cabot
you
are
our
what
again
scratched
myles
then
made
a
sign
of
submission
he
dreaded
the
paralyzing
bite
which
formians
usually
administer
to
their
victims
and
which
he
had
twice
experienced
in
the
past
but
fortunately
it
was
not
now
forthcoming
the
other
three
ants
kept
away
from
him
as
doggo
led
him
to
the
beached
airplane
and
soon
they
were
scudding
along
beneath
silver
skies
northward
as
it
later
turned
out
far
below
them
were
fields
and
tangled
tropical
woods
interspersed
with
rivulets
and
little
ponds
this
was
cupia
his
cupia
he
was
home
once
more
back
again
upon
the
planet
which
held
all
that
was
dear
to
him
in
two
worlds
his
heart
glowed
with
the
warmth
of
homecoming
what
mattered
it
that
he
was
now
a
prisoner
in
the
hands
or
rather
claws
of
his
old
enemies
the
formians
he
had
been
their
prisoner
before
and
had
escaped
once
more
he
could
escape
and
rescue
the
princess
lilla
poor
girl
how
eager
he
was
to
reach
her
side
and
save
her
from
that
peril
whatever
it
was
which
had
caused
her
to
flash
that
s
o
s
a
hundred
million
miles
across
the
solar
system
from
poros
to
the
earth
he
wondered
what
could
have
happened
in
cupia
since
his
departure
only
a
few
sangths
ago
how
was
it
that
the
had
survived
their
airplane
journey
across
the
boiling
seas
what
had
led
them
to
return
or
perhaps
these
ants
were
a
group
who
had
hidden
somewhere
and
thus
had
escaped
the
general
extermination
of
their
race
in
either
event
how
had
they
been
able
to
reconquer
cupia
and
where
was
their
former
leader
yuri
the
renegade
cupian
prince
these
and
a
hundred
other
similar
questions
flooded
in
upon
the
as
the
formian
airship
carried
him
a
captive
through
the
skies
he
gazed
again
at
the
scene
below
and
now
noted
one
difference
from
the
accustomed
porovian
landscape
for
nowhere
ran
the
smooth
concrete
roads
which
bear
the
swift
kerkools
of
the
cupians
to
all
parts
of
their
continent
what
uninhabited
portion
of
cupia
could
this
be
over
which
they
were
now
passing
turning
to
doggo
myles
extended
his
left
palm
and
made
a
motion
as
though
writing
on
it
with
the
thumb
and
forefinger
of
his
right
hand
but
the
waved
a
negative
with
one
of
his
forepaws
it
was
evident
that
there
were
no
writing
materials
aboard
the
ship
myles
would
have
to
wait
until
they
reached
their
landing
place
for
doubtless
they
would
soon
hover
down
in
some
city
or
town
though
just
which
one
he
could
not
guess
as
the
country
below
was
wholly
unfamiliar
finally
a
small
settlement
loomed
ahead
it
was
of
the
familiar
style
of
architecture
affected
by
the
and
from
its
appearance
was
very
new
on
its
outskirts
further
building
operations
were
actively
in
progress
apparently
a
few
survivors
of
the
accursed
race
of
formians
were
consolidating
their
position
and
attempting
to
build
up
a
new
empire
in
some
portion
of
the
continent
as
the
was
turning
these
thoughts
over
in
his
mind
the
plane
softly
settled
down
upon
one
of
the
flat
roofs
and
its
occupants
disembarked
three
of
the
ants
advanced
menacingly
toward
myles
but
doggo
held
them
off
then
all
of
the
party
descended
down
one
of
the
ramps
to
the
lower
levels
of
the
building
narrow
slitlike
window
openings
gave
onto
courtyards
where
fountains
played
and
masses
of
blue
and
yellow
flowers
bloomed
amid
lichens
with
red
and
purple
it
was
in
just
such
a
garden
through
just
such
a
window
that
he
had
first
looked
upon
the
lovely
lilla
crown
princess
of
cupia
the
sighed
where
was
his
beloved
wife
now
that
she
needed
his
help
was
certain
he
must
therefore
get
busy
so
once
again
he
made
motions
of
writing
on
the
palm
of
his
left
hand
with
the
thumb
and
forefinger
of
his
right
and
this
time
the
sign
language
produced
results
for
doggo
halted
the
procession
and
led
cabot
into
a
room
it
was
a
plain
bare
room
devoid
of
any
furniture
except
a
small
table
for
have
no
use
for
chairs
and
couches
the
sky
outside
was
already
beginning
to
pinken
with
the
unseen
sun
with
a
sweep
of
his
paw
doggo
indicated
that
this
was
to
be
cabot
s
quarters
then
with
another
wave
he
pointed
to
the
table
where
lay
a
pad
of
paper
and
stylus
not
a
stylus
as
employed
by
the
cupians
but
rather
one
equipped
with
straps
for
attaching
it
to
the
claw
of
a
formian
even
so
it
was
better
than
nothing
the
seized
it
eagerly
but
before
he
could
begin
writing
an
ant
entered
bearing
a
cupian
toga
and
bordered
with
grecian
wave
designs
in
blue
myles
put
on
this
garment
and
then
quickly
filled
a
sheet
with
questions
how
is
my
princess
and
my
son
the
baby
king
whence
come
all
you
formians
whose
race
i
thought
had
been
exterminated
what
part
of
cupia
is
this
what
is
this
city
where
is
prince
yuri
and
what
do
you
intend
to
do
with
me
time
then
he
passed
the
paper
and
stylus
over
to
his
old
friend
doggo
they
were
alone
together
at
last
the
s
reply
consumed
sheet
after
sheet
of
paper
but
owning
to
the
rapidity
of
porovian
shorthand
did
not
take
so
very
much
more
time
than
speaking
would
have
required
as
he
completed
each
sheet
he
passed
it
over
to
myles
who
read
as
follows
as
to
your
princess
and
your
son
i
know
not
for
this
is
not
cupia
do
you
remember
how
when
your
victorious
army
and
air
navy
swept
to
the
southern
extremity
of
what
had
been
formia
a
few
of
our
survivors
rose
in
planes
from
the
ruins
of
our
last
stronghold
and
braved
the
dangers
of
the
steam
clouds
which
overhang
the
boiling
seas
our
leader
was
prince
yuri
erstwhile
contender
for
the
throne
of
cupia
splendid
even
in
defeat
it
was
his
brain
that
conceived
our
daring
plan
of
escape
if
there
were
other
lands
beyond
the
boiling
seas
the
lands
which
tradition
taught
were
the
origin
of
the
cupian
race
then
there
we
might
prosper
and
raise
up
a
new
empire
at
the
worst
we
should
merely
meet
death
in
another
form
rather
than
at
your
hands
so
we
essayed
your
planes
followed
us
but
turned
back
as
we
neared
the
area
of
terrific
heat
soon
the
vapor
closed
over
us
blotting
our
enemies
and
our
native
land
from
for
page
after
page
doggo
the
related
the
harrowing
details
of
that
perilous
flight
across
the
boiling
seas
ending
with
the
words
here
we
are
and
here
are
you
in
yuriana
capitol
of
new
formia
but
how
is
it
that
you
myles
cabot
have
arrived
here
on
this
continent
in
exactly
the
same
manner
and
condition
in
which
i
discovered
you
in
formia
eight
years
ago
when
myles
reached
the
end
of
reading
this
narrative
he
in
turn
took
the
pad
and
stylus
and
related
how
he
had
gone
to
the
planet
minos
which
we
call
the
earth
to
learn
the
latest
discoveries
and
inventions
there
and
how
his
calculations
for
his
return
to
poros
had
been
upset
by
some
static
conditions
just
as
he
had
been
about
to
transmit
himself
back
oh
if
only
he
had
landed
by
chance
upon
the
same
beach
as
on
his
first
journey
through
the
skies
wisely
he
refrained
from
mentioning
the
s
o
s
message
from
lilla
but
his
recollection
of
her
predicament
spurred
him
to
be
anxious
about
her
rescue
his
immediate
problem
was
to
learn
what
the
planned
for
him
so
the
concluding
words
which
he
wrote
upon
the
pad
were
and
now
that
you
have
me
in
your
power
what
shall
you
do
with
me
old
friend
doggo
wrote
in
reply
that
depends
entirely
upon
yuri
our
king
whose
toga
you
now
have
iii
yuri
or
formis
the
grimaced
but
then
smiled
perhaps
his
succeeding
to
the
toga
of
king
yuri
might
prove
to
be
an
omen
so
yuri
is
king
of
the
ants
he
asked
yes
his
captor
replied
for
queen
formis
did
not
survive
the
trip
across
the
boiling
then
what
of
your
empire
myles
inquired
no
queen
no
eggs
how
can
your
race
continue
for
you
formians
are
like
the
ants
on
my
own
planet
doggo
s
reply
astounded
him
do
you
remember
back
at
wautoosa
i
told
you
that
some
of
us
lesser
formians
had
occasionally
laid
eggs
so
now
behold
before
you
doggo
admiral
of
the
formian
air
navy
and
mother
of
a
new
queen
this
was
truly
a
surprise
all
along
cabot
had
always
regarded
the
formians
as
mannish
and
rightly
so
for
they
performed
in
their
own
country
the
duties
assigned
to
men
among
the
cupians
furthermore
all
formians
save
only
the
reigning
formis
herself
were
called
by
the
porovian
pronoun
which
corresponds
to
he
in
english
when
myles
had
somewhat
recovered
from
his
astonishment
he
warmly
congratulated
his
friend
by
patting
him
on
the
side
of
the
head
as
is
the
porovian
custom
doggo
he
wrote
this
ought
to
constitute
you
a
person
of
some
importance
among
the
it
to
the
replied
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
merely
intensifies
yuri
s
mistrust
and
hatred
of
me
now
that
i
am
mother
of
the
queen
he
fears
that
i
may
turn
against
him
and
establish
formis
in
his
place
as
the
head
of
an
empire
of
the
formians
by
the
formians
and
for
the
formians
why
don
t
you
myles
wrote
it
seemed
to
him
to
be
a
bully
good
idea
and
incidentally
a
solution
of
his
own
difficulties
but
doggo
wrote
in
horror
it
would
be
treason
then
tore
up
all
the
correspondence
it
is
difficult
to
inculcate
the
thought
of
independence
in
the
mind
of
one
reared
in
an
autocracy
the
however
persisted
how
many
of
the
council
can
you
count
on
if
the
interests
of
yuri
should
clash
with
those
of
formis
only
and
again
doggo
tore
up
the
correspondence
myles
tactfully
changed
the
subject
where
is
the
now
he
asked
we
know
not
the
formian
wrote
in
reply
six
days
ago
he
left
us
in
his
airship
and
flew
westward
when
he
failed
to
return
we
sent
out
scout
planes
to
search
for
him
and
we
have
been
hunting
ever
since
when
we
sighted
you
on
the
beach
this
morning
we
thought
that
you
might
be
our
lost
leader
and
that
is
why
we
landed
and
approached
at
about
this
point
the
conversation
was
interrupted
by
a
worker
ant
who
brought
food
roast
alta
and
green
aphid
milk
with
what
relish
did
the
plunge
into
the
feast
his
first
taste
of
porovian
delicacies
in
many
months
during
the
meal
conversation
lagged
owing
to
the
difficulty
of
writing
and
eating
at
the
same
time
but
now
myles
cabot
seized
his
pad
and
stylus
and
wrote
have
you
ever
known
me
to
fail
in
any
undertaking
on
the
planet
poros
no
the
wrote
in
reply
have
you
ever
known
me
to
be
untrue
to
a
principle
a
cause
or
a
friend
no
doggo
replied
then
myles
wrote
let
us
make
your
daughter
queen
in
fact
as
well
as
in
it
is
treason
doggo
wrote
in
reply
but
this
time
he
did
not
tear
up
the
correspondence
treason
myles
asked
if
he
had
spoken
the
word
he
would
have
spoken
it
with
scorn
and
derision
treason
is
it
treason
to
support
your
own
queen
what
has
become
of
the
national
pride
of
the
once
great
formians
look
i
pledge
myself
to
the
cause
of
formis
rightful
queen
of
formia
formis
daughter
of
doggo
what
say
you
this
time
as
he
tore
up
the
correspondence
doggo
signified
an
affirmative
and
thus
there
resulted
further
correspondence
doggo
myles
wrote
can
you
get
to
the
antenna
of
the
queen
the
indicated
that
he
could
if
she
has
inherited
any
of
your
character
myles
continued
she
will
assert
herself
if
given
half
a
so
the
pitmanesque
conversation
continued
long
since
had
the
pink
light
of
porovian
evening
faded
from
the
western
sky
the
ceiling
were
lit
the
night
showed
through
the
windows
and
still
the
two
old
friends
wrote
on
myles
standish
cabot
the
bostonian
and
doggo
no
the
only
really
humanlike
whom
myles
had
ever
known
among
the
once
dominant
race
of
poros
finally
as
the
dials
indicated
midnight
the
two
conspirators
ceased
their
labors
all
was
arranged
for
the
d
they
tore
into
shreds
every
scrap
of
used
paper
leaving
extant
merely
the
s
concluding
words
meanwhile
you
are
my
doggo
then
rang
a
soundless
bell
which
was
answered
by
a
worker
ant
whom
he
inaudibly
directed
to
bring
sufficient
draperies
to
form
a
bed
for
the
these
brought
the
two
friends
patted
each
other
a
fond
good
night
and
the
tired
lay
down
for
the
first
sleep
which
he
had
had
in
over
forty
earth
hours
it
hardly
seemed
possible
night
before
last
he
had
slept
peacefully
on
a
conventional
in
a
little
new
england
farmhouse
then
had
come
the
s
o
s
message
from
the
skies
and
here
he
was
now
millions
of
miles
away
through
space
retiring
on
matted
silver
felting
on
the
concrete
floor
of
a
porovian
such
are
the
mutations
of
fortune
with
these
thoughts
the
returned
wanderer
lapsed
into
a
deep
and
dreamless
sleep
when
he
awakened
in
the
morning
there
was
a
guard
posted
at
the
door
doggo
did
not
show
up
until
nearly
noon
when
he
rattled
in
bristling
with
excitement
seizing
the
pad
he
wrote
a
stormy
session
of
the
council
of
twelve
we
are
all
agreed
that
you
must
be
indicted
for
high
crimes
and
misdemeanors
but
the
great
question
is
as
to
just
what
we
can
charge
you
sorry
i
can
t
assist
you
the
wrote
how
would
it
be
if
i
were
to
slap
your
daughter
s
face
or
something
or
why
not
try
me
for
general
cussedness
that
is
just
what
we
finally
decided
to
do
the
wrote
in
reply
we
shall
try
you
on
general
principles
and
let
the
proper
accusation
develop
from
the
evidence
at
some
stage
of
the
proceedings
it
will
inevitably
occur
to
some
member
of
the
council
to
suggest
that
you
be
charged
with
treason
to
yuri
whereupon
two
members
of
the
council
whom
i
have
won
over
to
the
cause
of
my
daughter
will
raise
the
objection
that
yuri
is
not
our
king
this
will
be
the
signal
for
the
proclaiming
of
queen
formis
if
you
will
waive
counsel
the
trial
can
take
place
i
will
waive
anything
myles
replied
counsel
immunity
extradition
anything
in
order
to
speed
up
my
return
to
cupia
where
lilla
awaits
in
some
dire
all
right
doggo
wrote
and
the
conference
was
at
an
end
the
morrow
would
decide
the
ascendancy
of
myles
cabot
or
the
prince
yuri
over
the
new
continent
iv
the
coup
d
etat
the
next
morning
myles
cabot
was
led
under
guard
to
the
council
chamber
of
the
dread
thirteen
formis
and
her
twelve
advisers
the
accused
was
placed
in
a
wicker
cage
from
which
he
surveyed
his
surroundings
as
the
proceedings
opened
on
a
raised
platform
stood
the
ant
queen
surmounted
by
a
scarlet
canopy
which
set
off
the
perfect
proportions
of
her
body
on
each
side
of
her
stood
six
refined
and
intelligent
her
councillors
one
of
the
twelve
was
doggo
messenger
ants
hurried
hither
and
thither
first
the
accusation
was
read
myles
being
furnished
with
a
written
copy
the
witnesses
were
then
called
they
were
veterans
who
had
served
in
the
wars
in
which
cabot
had
twice
freed
cupia
from
the
domination
of
its
formian
oppressors
they
spoke
with
bitterness
of
the
downfall
of
their
beloved
formia
their
testimony
was
brief
then
the
accused
was
asked
if
he
wished
to
say
anything
in
his
own
behalf
myles
rose
then
shrugged
his
shoulders
sat
down
again
and
wrote
i
fully
realize
the
futility
of
making
an
argument
through
the
antennae
of
whereupon
the
queen
and
the
council
went
into
executive
session
their
remarks
were
not
intended
for
the
eyes
of
the
prisoner
but
he
soon
observed
that
some
kind
of
a
dispute
was
on
between
doggo
supported
by
two
councillors
named
emu
and
fum
on
one
side
and
a
councillor
named
barth
on
the
other
as
this
dispute
reached
its
height
a
messenger
ant
rushed
in
and
held
up
one
paw
cabot
s
interpreter
not
deeming
this
a
part
of
the
executive
session
obligingly
translated
the
following
into
writing
the
messenger
yuri
lives
and
reigns
over
cupia
it
is
his
command
that
cabot
barth
it
is
the
radio
know
then
o
queen
and
ye
members
of
the
council
that
when
we
fled
across
the
boiling
seas
under
the
gallant
leadership
of
prince
yuri
the
man
with
the
heart
of
a
formian
he
brought
with
him
one
of
those
powerful
radio
sets
invented
by
the
beast
who
is
our
prisoner
here
supporters
of
yuri
still
remained
among
the
cupians
and
he
has
been
in
constant
communication
with
these
ever
since
shortly
after
our
arrival
here
from
them
he
learned
of
the
return
of
myles
cabot
to
the
planet
minos
then
yuri
disappeared
those
of
us
who
were
closest
to
him
suspected
that
he
had
gone
back
across
the
boiling
seas
to
claim
as
his
own
the
throne
of
cupia
but
we
hesitated
to
announce
this
until
we
were
sure
for
we
feared
that
some
of
our
own
people
would
regard
his
departure
as
desertion
yet
who
can
blame
him
for
returning
to
his
and
to
the
throne
which
is
his
by
rights
to
which
the
messenger
added
and
he
offers
to
give
us
back
our
own
old
country
if
we
too
will
return
across
the
boiling
seas
it
is
a
lie
doggo
shouted
yuri
usurper
of
the
thrones
of
two
continents
bah
shouted
emu
yuri
our
rightful
leader
shouted
barth
give
us
a
queen
of
our
own
race
shouted
fum
release
the
prisoner
shouted
the
queen
and
that
is
all
that
myles
learned
of
the
conversation
for
his
interpreter
at
this
juncture
stopped
writing
and
obeyed
the
queen
the
was
free
with
one
bound
he
gained
the
throne
where
fighting
was
already
in
progress
between
the
two
factions
barth
and
doggo
were
rolling
over
and
over
on
the
floor
in
a
death
grapple
while
the
had
backed
to
the
rear
of
the
stage
closely
guarded
by
emu
and
fum
seizing
one
of
the
pikes
which
supported
the
scarlet
canopy
myles
wrenched
it
loose
and
drove
it
into
the
thorax
of
barth
in
another
instant
the
and
doggo
stood
beside
the
queen
now
came
pouring
into
the
chamber
through
all
the
entrances
taking
sides
as
they
entered
and
sized
up
the
situation
if
it
had
still
been
in
vogue
among
the
formians
to
be
known
by
numbers
rather
than
names
and
to
have
these
identifying
numbers
painted
on
the
backs
of
their
abdomens
followed
by
the
numbers
of
those
whom
they
had
defeated
in
the
duels
so
common
among
them
then
many
a
formian
would
have
got
the
number
of
many
another
that
day
as
myles
battled
with
his
pike
beside
formis
queen
of
the
ants
he
could
well
imagine
the
conflicting
shouts
of
death
to
the
usurper
formia
for
the
formians
long
live
queen
formis
long
live
prince
yuri
which
must
have
resounded
throughout
the
chamber
but
to
him
all
was
silence
for
he
was
without
the
antennae
wherewith
to
pick
up
the
radiated
speech
of
the
contenders
so
as
he
wielded
the
pike
in
silence
he
had
opportunity
to
reflect
on
the
incongruity
of
his
position
here
was
he
myles
cabot
regent
of
cupia
the
man
who
had
driven
the
ants
forever
from
their
dominion
over
his
people
and
yet
now
fighting
side
by
side
with
their
leaders
defending
the
life
of
their
queen
yet
was
she
not
the
daughter
of
doggo
his
only
friend
among
the
ants
and
would
not
her
victory
mean
the
speedy
return
of
myles
to
his
own
continent
as
the
jabbed
to
right
and
left
among
the
supporters
of
his
enemy
yuri
there
came
to
his
human
ears
the
sound
of
rifle
fire
it
might
prove
a
godsend
or
an
added
menace
according
to
whose
paw
held
the
rifle
but
no
chances
must
be
taken
on
the
life
of
the
queen
so
myles
made
frantic
signs
to
doggo
of
impending
danger
the
queen
and
her
supporters
outnumbered
were
fighting
with
their
backs
to
one
of
the
walls
of
the
room
a
short
distance
along
this
wall
on
the
side
where
cabot
stood
was
a
door
so
he
now
began
edging
his
way
along
the
wall
to
this
door
this
was
not
difficult
as
the
having
only
their
mandibles
to
fight
with
greatly
respected
his
pike
he
gained
the
door
and
passed
by
but
not
through
it
the
shots
came
nearer
and
nearer
then
doggo
opened
the
door
and
slipped
through
with
formis
and
the
rest
of
her
immediate
supporters
the
door
closed
and
myles
cabot
stood
guarding
the
exit
with
his
against
the
hordes
of
antdom
he
had
no
difficulty
in
defending
himself
from
those
in
front
of
him
but
the
ants
who
began
to
close
in
on
him
from
each
side
were
a
different
matter
he
received
several
bad
scratches
on
his
shoulders
and
hips
and
his
toga
was
ripped
and
torn
but
fortunately
he
was
able
to
ward
off
their
paralyzing
bites
nevertheless
his
enemies
pressed
so
close
that
it
was
difficult
for
him
to
manipulate
his
long
weapon
in
fact
it
was
only
the
jamming
of
the
ants
upon
one
another
and
upon
the
dead
bodies
of
their
slain
comrades
that
kept
them
from
him
he
now
was
holding
his
pike
by
the
middle
with
both
hands
using
one
end
as
a
club
and
the
other
as
a
dagger
the
black
circle
of
the
ants
was
steadily
closing
in
on
him
a
pair
of
mandibles
from
the
left
snapped
angrily
within
a
few
inches
of
his
throat
instantly
he
drove
the
point
of
his
lance
home
between
horrid
jaws
but
at
the
same
instant
its
butt
was
seized
by
a
pair
of
jaws
to
his
right
he
could
not
pull
it
free
at
last
he
was
weaponless
and
not
only
that
but
pinned
to
the
wall
by
the
shaft
of
his
own
pike
as
well
and
then
to
his
surprise
the
ants
before
him
separated
as
at
a
command
the
butt
of
his
lance
was
dropped
as
myles
wrenched
the
point
loose
from
the
dead
body
of
the
formian
in
which
it
had
been
stuck
and
gazed
expectant
down
the
long
aisle
which
had
opened
before
him
he
saw
confronting
him
at
the
other
end
an
armed
with
the
peculiar
type
of
rifle
which
the
formians
had
adapted
from
those
which
myles
himself
had
built
for
cupian
use
in
the
first
war
of
liberation
briefly
the
two
surveyed
each
other
then
slowly
the
rifle
was
raised
until
its
aim
settled
squarely
upon
the
s
chest
instantaneously
the
glance
of
myles
cabot
swept
the
black
hordes
which
hemmed
him
in
on
each
side
there
was
no
escape
yet
how
can
man
die
better
than
facing
fearful
odds
with
a
wild
warwhoop
which
was
utterly
lost
on
the
of
the
assembled
formians
myles
charged
down
the
narrow
way
straight
into
the
muzzle
of
the
rifle
of
his
antagonist
the
astonished
hastily
pulled
the
trigger
a
shot
rang
out
but
still
the
impetuous
rush
of
myles
continued
and
before
the
rifle
could
be
discharged
a
second
time
myles
had
driven
his
spear
deep
into
the
leering
insect
face
the
formian
staggered
back
the
rifle
clattered
to
the
floor
the
not
waiting
to
withdraw
his
own
weapon
stooped
seized
the
fallen
firearm
and
wheeled
to
confront
his
enemies
who
fell
back
in
a
snarling
arc
before
this
new
menace
myles
stood
now
in
one
of
the
entranceways
of
the
council
chamber
and
thus
was
secure
against
flank
attack
but
not
against
an
assault
from
the
rear
in
fact
even
as
he
stood
thus
irresolute
a
rattling
noise
behind
him
in
the
hallways
revealed
to
his
human
ears
the
approach
of
a
new
enemy
what
was
he
to
do
to
remain
as
he
was
meant
to
this
newcomer
whereas
to
turn
about
would
mean
that
those
within
the
chamber
would
undoubtedly
rush
him
in
this
predicament
myles
grasped
his
gun
firmly
and
wheeled
backward
to
the
left
until
he
was
flattened
against
the
wall
of
the
corridor
in
which
he
was
standing
from
this
position
he
could
turn
his
head
slightly
to
the
left
and
see
into
the
council
chamber
or
to
the
right
and
look
down
the
long
hall
directly
opposite
him
was
one
of
those
narrow
slitlike
windows
so
typical
of
porovian
architecture
it
was
too
narrow
for
the
passage
of
the
huge
body
of
an
but
a
human
being
could
conceivably
squeeze
through
thus
it
offered
a
means
out
a
way
of
escape
the
lone
ant
in
the
corridor
was
joined
by
the
others
they
and
their
compatriots
within
the
chamber
slowly
closed
in
on
the
cornered
there
was
no
time
to
speculate
upon
the
depth
of
the
drop
outside
with
a
suddenness
which
caused
his
aggressors
to
recoil
momentarily
myles
dashed
across
to
the
window
forced
his
way
through
and
still
grasping
his
rifle
plunged
headlong
two
stories
into
a
clump
of
gray
lichens
in
the
courtyard
below
hastily
extricating
himself
he
looked
up
at
the
window
which
he
had
just
quitted
there
framed
by
the
masonry
was
the
head
of
an
a
quick
shot
and
the
head
stared
at
him
no
more
before
another
formian
could
take
post
at
the
window
to
observe
the
direction
of
cabot
s
departure
the
latter
ran
quickly
from
the
courtyard
garden
into
the
interior
of
the
building
again
his
first
thought
was
to
join
doggo
queen
formis
and
their
faction
so
taking
a
firm
hold
on
his
rifle
he
hurried
in
the
direction
in
which
they
had
made
their
escape
the
first
whom
he
met
within
the
building
was
emu
one
of
the
three
members
of
the
council
who
had
been
a
party
to
the
original
conspiracy
this
ant
was
fleeing
from
something
in
very
evident
terror
so
that
it
was
all
cabot
could
do
to
stop
him
but
the
threat
of
was
finally
effective
then
extracting
a
cartridge
from
the
magazine
of
his
firearm
cabot
scratched
upon
the
smooth
wall
the
brief
question
what
of
doggo
and
formis
emu
snatched
the
cartridge
and
quickly
wrote
the
reply
dead
both
dead
the
revolution
has
collapsed
flee
for
your
life
then
the
clattered
rapidly
off
down
the
corridor
taking
the
precious
cartridge
with
him
he
had
not
been
too
flustered
to
think
of
that
myles
heaved
a
sigh
of
at
having
brought
his
friends
to
this
sad
end
but
then
he
reflected
doggo
had
been
in
a
situation
in
which
conflict
with
the
authorities
and
then
execution
would
have
been
inevitable
sooner
or
later
the
revolution
had
been
his
one
best
bet
and
it
was
no
one
s
fault
that
it
had
failed
now
that
doggo
and
formis
were
dead
there
was
no
longer
any
obligation
binding
myles
to
stay
and
fight
in
fact
he
owed
it
to
his
loved
ones
in
cupia
to
preserve
his
own
life
until
he
could
find
some
way
of
rejoining
them
so
he
set
out
to
escape
from
the
city
for
some
time
he
threaded
the
corridors
without
meeting
any
ants
although
occasionally
there
drifted
down
to
him
the
sounds
of
fighting
on
the
upper
levels
but
at
last
as
he
rounded
a
turn
he
saw
before
him
a
formian
and
it
was
one
whom
he
recognized
namely
the
messenger
ant
who
had
brought
to
the
trial
the
radiogram
from
prince
yuri
the
ant
s
back
was
toward
him
cabot
cautiously
withdrew
a
step
then
raising
his
rifle
he
again
advanced
and
fired
full
at
his
enemy
but
the
hammer
merely
clicked
there
was
no
explosion
the
magazine
was
empty
cabot
s
first
impulse
was
to
throw
the
weapon
away
then
he
reflected
that
even
an
unloaded
gun
might
well
serve
to
awe
his
enemies
and
hold
them
at
a
distance
so
he
retained
it
by
this
time
the
messenger
ant
had
disappeared
around
a
turn
farther
down
the
corridor
so
cabot
hastened
after
him
for
it
had
suddenly
occurred
to
the
that
this
ant
was
undoubtedly
returning
to
the
hidden
radio
set
whence
he
had
come
radio
means
of
a
communication
with
his
own
continent
if
he
could
but
reach
the
instruments
the
messenger
had
announced
at
the
trial
that
yuri
was
in
cupia
and
knew
of
cabot
s
presence
in
this
new
land
thus
it
was
certain
that
complete
wireless
communication
had
been
established
between
the
two
continents
but
equally
undoubtedly
this
communication
had
been
established
at
a
which
kept
the
knowledge
of
cabot
s
return
pretty
much
a
secret
of
prince
yuri
and
his
own
followers
this
information
would
probably
induce
the
renegade
prince
to
speed
up
whatever
nefarious
schemes
he
had
afoot
in
cupia
but
if
cabot
could
once
get
on
the
air
and
adjust
the
formian
sending
set
to
the
of
luno
castle
or
run
it
through
all
its
available
he
could
broadcast
to
the
cupian
nation
the
fact
that
he
was
alive
and
well
and
would
return
he
knew
not
lead
them
such
news
should
strengthen
the
hearts
of
the
loyal
cupians
to
rally
to
the
cause
of
his
wife
the
princess
lilla
and
his
son
the
baby
king
so
he
quickened
his
pace
and
soon
caught
sight
again
of
the
messenger
ant
from
then
on
he
stealthily
stalked
his
quarry
who
led
him
through
many
a
winding
before
finally
they
emerged
from
the
city
into
the
open
fields
beyond
the
fields
lay
the
rocky
foothills
of
a
mountain
range
caution
dictated
that
cabot
remain
under
the
shelter
of
the
city
walls
until
the
formian
disappeared
among
the
rocks
then
he
ran
lightly
across
the
plain
to
take
up
the
trail
once
more
as
he
too
gained
the
rocks
he
glanced
back
to
see
if
his
departure
had
been
noted
no
there
was
no
sign
of
life
evidently
the
fighting
had
drawn
all
the
inhabitants
to
the
interior
of
the
city
so
with
a
sigh
of
relief
myles
hurried
after
the
messenger
ant
at
the
place
where
myles
had
noticed
the
formian
enter
the
rocks
there
was
the
beginning
of
a
trail
so
up
this
winding
trail
he
sped
and
soon
caught
sight
of
his
quarry
from
that
time
on
more
caution
was
necessary
but
nevertheless
the
pursuer
was
able
to
keep
the
pursued
always
in
sight
until
just
after
a
turn
in
the
road
had
obscured
his
view
myles
came
upon
a
place
where
the
way
forked
pausing
he
scratched
his
head
in
dismay
then
carefully
examined
the
ground
for
evidences
of
claw
marks
but
none
were
apparent
dropping
to
his
hands
and
knees
the
scrutinized
the
dirt
with
even
more
care
and
at
last
imagining
that
he
observed
some
slight
scratches
to
the
right
he
took
the
branch
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
proceed
with
great
rapidity
if
he
would
catch
up
with
the
messenger
ant
so
myles
broke
into
a
dog
trot
on
and
on
he
ran
up
into
the
rocky
mountains
at
last
he
sat
down
exhausted
on
a
large
boulder
just
as
the
silvery
sky
turned
crimson
in
the
west
and
darkness
crept
up
out
of
the
east
it
was
quite
evident
that
he
had
taken
the
wrong
road
at
the
fork
and
also
that
he
must
now
spend
the
night
half
clad
and
alone
amid
the
rocks
of
the
mountains
of
this
strange
new
continent
v
lost
amid
the
rocks
but
although
myles
cabot
was
lost
he
was
free
for
the
first
time
since
his
return
to
poros
so
not
disheartened
he
arose
and
proceeded
along
the
trail
looking
for
food
and
a
place
to
spend
the
night
and
presently
came
upon
a
green
cow
as
he
was
wont
to
call
the
aphids
which
are
kept
both
by
cupians
and
formians
for
the
which
they
produce
it
made
no
objection
to
cabot
s
approach
nor
to
his
manipulating
the
two
horns
which
projected
from
its
back
with
the
result
that
the
tired
man
was
presently
regaling
himself
with
a
satisfying
drafts
of
green
milk
from
a
leafy
cup
the
bush
which
furnished
the
leaf
to
fashion
the
cup
closely
resembled
the
tartan
bushes
of
cupia
whose
leaves
are
put
to
so
many
uses
in
that
country
myles
cabot
accordingly
stripped
off
a
considerable
portion
of
the
foliage
and
lay
down
in
a
bed
of
warm
thick
green
for
the
night
the
morning
dawned
silver
bright
myles
drew
another
meal
from
the
grazing
aphid
and
then
pressed
on
up
the
rocky
defile
he
did
not
dare
return
for
fear
of
meeting
and
besides
now
that
a
night
s
rest
had
to
some
extent
tempered
his
chagrin
at
not
catching
up
with
the
particular
whom
he
had
been
pursuing
he
could
not
be
sure
he
had
taken
the
wrong
road
after
all
so
on
he
went
up
the
rocky
path
around
noon
the
path
petered
out
at
the
top
of
an
eminence
which
gave
cabot
an
opportunity
to
survey
the
surrounding
scenery
to
the
westward
lay
the
city
from
which
he
had
fled
what
had
become
he
wondered
of
the
supporters
of
his
friend
doggo
and
of
formis
the
whose
cause
he
had
espoused
according
to
emu
doggo
and
formis
were
both
dead
or
cabot
would
never
have
deserted
them
cabot
turned
his
attention
next
to
the
northward
to
his
great
joy
on
the
next
peak
to
the
one
where
he
sat
there
stood
two
rough
wooden
towers
spanned
by
an
aerial
he
decided
to
cut
across
country
and
attempt
to
approach
the
installation
by
stealth
so
he
started
scrambling
down
into
the
intervening
valley
never
before
had
the
traveled
through
such
difficult
country
as
soon
as
he
had
gone
a
short
distance
below
the
summit
he
encountered
a
continuous
expanse
of
boulders
ranging
in
size
from
a
man
s
head
to
twenty
feet
or
more
in
diameter
and
piled
aimlessly
together
lying
crossways
in
every
direction
upon
and
between
the
rocks
were
the
gaunt
skeletons
of
fallen
trees
in
all
stages
of
decay
the
sharp
edges
of
the
rocks
cut
and
tore
the
bare
feet
of
the
while
the
splinters
of
the
fallen
trees
jabbed
his
body
time
and
again
he
slipped
and
nearly
fell
into
one
of
the
chasms
which
yawned
between
the
boulders
and
on
one
of
these
occasions
he
must
have
inadvertently
let
go
the
which
he
had
treasured
so
far
so
carefully
for
presently
he
noticed
that
it
was
gone
but
to
all
this
there
was
one
extenuating
feature
although
myles
did
not
realize
it
at
the
time
namely
that
his
physical
pain
and
the
need
for
constant
vigilance
on
his
part
so
occupied
his
mind
as
to
spare
him
from
the
mental
pain
which
had
been
his
almost
constant
companion
since
his
return
to
poros
the
attention
necessary
to
avoid
misjudging
a
jump
or
slipping
into
a
dark
deep
hole
or
being
impaled
by
a
crowded
out
of
his
mind
even
his
great
love
and
anxiety
for
princess
lilla
and
baby
kew
through
the
maze
of
obstacles
cabot
toiled
all
day
long
oh
to
reach
the
radio
station
established
by
his
enemy
yuri
and
get
into
touch
with
his
own
continent
thus
he
could
learn
what
was
happening
in
cupia
and
also
give
word
of
his
own
safe
arrival
on
the
planet
safe
hm
he
smiled
grimly
at
the
word
i
reach
that
station
he
thought
and
then
when
i
have
talked
with
cupia
i
must
secure
a
formian
plane
by
hook
or
by
crook
and
brave
the
boiling
seas
if
ants
have
crossed
those
seas
safely
if
yuri
has
safely
crossed
them
twice
then
why
can
not
i
the
minorian
as
he
communed
thus
with
himself
a
faint
pink
flush
appeared
in
the
sky
slowly
painfully
he
continued
his
way
gradually
the
pink
light
turned
to
crimson
in
the
west
and
then
darkened
to
a
royal
purple
gradually
the
black
night
crept
up
out
of
the
east
but
also
gradually
the
boulders
became
smaller
and
smaller
as
he
clambered
upward
until
just
as
darkness
finally
enveloped
the
planet
the
tired
man
gained
the
smooth
rocks
of
the
summit
and
lay
down
amid
some
leaves
he
had
had
nothing
to
eat
or
drink
since
his
breakfast
of
green
milk
that
morning
he
had
undergone
an
exhausting
journey
his
feet
were
bruised
and
cut
his
body
covered
with
innumerable
scratches
and
he
was
weary
thirsty
and
hungry
but
he
had
almost
reached
the
point
which
he
had
been
seeking
and
this
thought
comforted
him
as
his
eyes
closed
in
healthy
and
dreamless
sleep
next
morning
early
he
was
up
rested
parched
and
ravenous
as
the
first
faint
pink
tinged
the
eastern
sky
myles
cabot
shook
off
the
leaves
and
completed
the
ascent
it
only
required
a
few
moments
for
him
to
reach
the
top
a
narrow
plateau
about
a
mile
in
length
near
the
farther
end
of
which
there
stood
a
small
cabin
with
its
two
towers
and
aerial
with
a
cry
of
he
knew
the
earless
formians
could
not
raced
toward
it
the
huge
chain
and
lock
which
secured
its
door
on
the
outside
indicated
that
it
was
unoccupied
and
a
glance
through
the
narrow
slitlike
windows
confirmed
this
the
glance
through
the
window
also
revealed
the
presence
of
a
complete
radio
sending
and
receiving
set
of
the
same
general
which
he
himself
had
adapted
for
the
use
of
cupians
and
formians
on
the
other
continent
imitation
is
the
most
insulting
form
of
flattery
as
poblath
the
cupian
philosopher
used
to
say
yet
cabot
was
willing
to
brook
the
insult
until
suddenly
it
dawned
on
him
that
the
set
had
no
earphones
nor
microphone
of
course
not
since
it
was
designed
for
use
by
creatures
who
possessed
neither
ears
nor
vocal
speech
gone
then
was
all
hope
of
news
from
home
even
if
he
could
succeed
in
breaking
in
at
the
most
he
would
merely
be
able
by
interposing
an
interrupter
in
the
primary
or
secondary
of
that
aerial
circuit
to
send
a
message
across
the
boiling
use
the
term
aerial
circuit
because
antenna
circuit
would
be
ambiguous
as
the
latter
term
might
have
either
its
conventional
earth
significance
or
might
mean
the
circuit
in
which
the
formian
operator
would
place
living
antennae
in
sending
and
receiving
well
even
a
chance
to
send
to
cupia
a
message
to
the
effect
that
he
was
free
and
safe
would
be
worth
something
myles
cabot
tried
the
slitlike
windows
and
finding
them
too
narrow
slid
quickly
down
the
slope
soon
to
return
laboriously
with
a
rock
which
he
heaved
against
the
door
again
and
again
he
heaved
the
rock
until
he
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
the
door
crack
and
then
give
finally
a
large
enough
opening
was
effected
to
afford
passage
for
a
man
although
not
for
a
formian
and
through
this
breach
myles
cabot
squeezed
into
the
station
a
few
minutes
scrutiny
familiarized
him
with
the
details
of
the
the
generator
set
and
the
everything
was
in
running
order
and
the
fuel
tank
was
full
so
he
fashioned
a
rude
sending
key
broke
one
of
the
circuits
and
tied
in
the
key
then
he
and
cranked
the
the
generator
threw
the
main
switch
and
sat
down
to
flash
across
the
seas
the
message
which
was
to
hold
firm
his
partisans
in
cupia
until
he
could
join
them
but
at
that
instant
an
arrow
hummed
through
the
hole
in
the
door
and
struck
quivering
in
the
bench
beside
him
cabot
sprang
to
his
feet
and
slid
home
the
huge
beam
which
barred
the
door
on
the
inside
this
was
a
precaution
which
he
had
neglected
to
take
before
next
he
filled
the
hole
in
the
door
with
some
boards
hastily
wrenched
from
the
then
picking
up
a
formian
rifle
and
bandolier
which
hung
on
the
wall
he
made
his
way
to
one
of
the
slit
windows
on
the
same
side
as
the
door
and
peeped
cautiously
out
the
result
was
immediate
an
arrow
sped
through
the
window
and
passed
just
above
his
head
but
even
as
he
ducked
instinctively
he
saw
a
dark
form
moving
behind
a
bush
at
some
distance
outside
so
quickly
rising
again
he
discharged
the
rifle
square
at
the
bush
there
came
a
cry
of
pain
followed
by
silence
and
there
were
no
more
feathered
incursions
not
knowing
whether
his
enemy
had
been
disposed
of
or
whether
the
cessation
of
the
stream
of
arrows
was
merely
a
ruse
to
entice
him
from
his
shelter
myles
did
not
dare
venture
forth
to
investigate
from
the
first
time
the
arrow
had
struck
the
until
this
final
squelching
of
the
unknown
enemy
myles
had
been
engrossed
in
action
now
came
the
reaction
as
he
realized
how
narrowly
he
had
twice
escaped
from
death
in
the
last
few
minutes
he
shuddered
at
the
thought
and
turned
pale
not
however
at
the
danger
to
himself
but
rather
at
the
danger
to
his
loved
ones
in
cupia
he
must
keep
himself
alive
until
he
could
reach
and
save
them
from
whatever
peril
it
was
that
had
caused
lilla
to
send
the
sos
which
had
recalled
him
to
poros
but
being
ever
the
inquisitive
scientist
his
attention
was
soon
distracted
by
the
arrow
which
stood
sticking
to
the
bench
its
shaft
was
of
some
hard
and
very
springy
wood
its
tip
was
of
chipped
stone
resembling
flint
and
bound
to
the
shaft
by
vegetable
fibers
its
feathers
were
thin
laminae
of
wood
doubtless
because
birds
and
hence
true
feathers
are
unknown
on
poros
why
on
rather
on
the
employing
such
crude
weapons
rifles
they
had
aplenty
and
powder
was
easy
to
manufacture
besides
what
did
they
know
of
bows
and
arrows
which
had
never
been
used
by
them
even
in
the
days
before
cabot
the
minorian
introduced
firearms
upon
the
planet
thus
these
arrows
presented
a
perplexing
problem
but
a
practical
job
remained
to
be
performed
before
myles
was
to
have
any
time
for
abstract
questions
the
message
to
cupia
must
be
sent
off
the
returned
to
the
radio
set
the
and
the
generator
were
still
running
the
whole
apparatus
appeared
to
be
functioning
properly
and
so
myles
ticked
off
into
space
the
following
message
cq
cq
cq
de
cabot
cabot
cabot
i
have
returned
to
poros
from
minos
i
am
on
the
continent
of
the
formians
i
am
in
complete
control
there
that
was
a
lie
but
it
would
serve
to
hearten
his
supporters
or
throw
the
fear
of
the
supreme
builder
into
the
partisans
of
yuri
whichever
it
reached
the
message
continued
do
not
expect
me
soon
for
first
i
must
consolidate
what
i
have
gained
here
but
when
i
do
come
yuri
beware
my
friends
hold
out
until
then
i
have
spoken
de
cabot
this
message
he
sent
again
and
again
at
every
wavelength
of
which
the
installation
was
capable
he
repeated
and
repeated
it
until
he
was
tired
and
then
for
the
first
time
he
remembered
his
thirst
and
his
hunger
fortunately
there
was
both
food
and
drink
in
the
shack
so
cabot
satisfied
his
wants
and
then
went
at
his
message
again
when
at
last
he
paused
once
more
for
a
rest
and
shut
off
the
his
human
ears
caught
a
familiar
rattling
sound
instantly
he
realized
the
situation
one
or
more
were
approaching
sure
enough
as
he
looked
out
of
a
window
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
he
saw
two
of
these
creatures
trotting
toward
him
across
the
plateau
both
carried
rifles
slung
at
their
backs
so
without
waiting
for
their
nearer
approach
myles
opened
fire
one
of
the
formians
dropped
but
the
other
turned
and
fled
and
in
spite
of
the
hail
of
bullets
which
the
sent
after
it
reached
the
crest
in
apparent
safety
and
disappeared
from
view
cabot
knew
what
that
meant
to
him
it
portended
the
early
return
of
the
fugitive
ant
with
scores
of
his
fellows
to
lay
siege
to
the
radio
station
then
a
doubt
occurred
to
him
what
if
these
ants
were
members
of
doggo
s
faction
and
he
had
killed
a
friend
and
so
at
the
risk
of
his
life
he
unbarred
the
door
and
rushed
out
to
inspect
the
dead
body
but
it
was
no
ant
whom
he
knew
time
would
tell
whether
the
surviving
ant
would
return
with
friends
or
foes
meanwhile
cabot
must
get
busy
with
his
message
so
at
it
again
he
went
first
barring
the
door
again
from
time
to
time
he
rested
and
listened
for
the
approach
of
formians
occasionally
he
ate
and
drank
during
his
longer
rests
he
carted
the
rifle
the
ammunition
and
some
provisions
to
a
point
quite
a
distance
down
the
mountainside
and
cached
them
there
for
he
had
formulated
a
plan
of
escape
but
mostly
he
stuck
to
his
signaling
all
cupia
or
such
of
it
as
might
still
possess
radio
sets
in
spite
of
the
renewed
dominion
of
yuri
must
be
made
to
know
of
the
return
of
myles
cabot
from
the
earth
night
fell
and
with
it
came
a
respite
from
the
danger
of
formian
attack
for
these
creatures
would
never
venture
forth
in
the
darkness
without
lights
and
lights
would
betray
them
myles
spent
part
of
the
night
in
sending
his
message
part
in
watching
for
approaching
lights
and
part
in
dozing
finally
along
toward
morning
he
set
about
wrecking
the
set
for
he
did
not
wish
the
formians
to
get
into
communication
with
cupia
and
undo
the
effect
of
his
own
message
by
pointing
out
its
falsity
accordingly
he
smashed
the
tubes
unwound
the
inductances
and
transformers
cut
all
the
wiring
into
little
bits
bent
the
plates
of
the
condensers
chiseled
through
the
coils
of
the
generator
pounded
the
to
pieces
and
drained
the
trophil
tank
it
would
be
many
sangths
before
a
new
radio
set
could
be
built
if
indeed
these
formians
knew
enough
of
the
art
to
ever
build
another
his
work
of
destruction
completed
he
sat
down
to
wait
but
the
inaction
palled
on
him
and
before
he
knew
it
he
had
fallen
sound
asleep
he
awakened
with
a
start
it
was
broad
daylight
he
listened
there
was
much
rattling
outside
so
he
walked
to
the
door
unbarred
it
and
stepped
out
he
was
not
afraid
for
on
the
evening
before
he
had
nailed
above
the
door
two
crossed
sticks
the
porovian
equivalent
of
a
flag
of
truce
at
a
short
distance
stood
a
band
of
thirty
or
forty
their
leader
holding
a
pair
of
crossed
sticks
accordingly
the
ragged
advanced
not
one
of
them
did
he
recognize
but
this
was
no
indication
of
their
identity
were
these
members
of
the
yuri
faction
he
wondered
or
of
the
faction
recently
captained
by
the
now
deceased
doggo
if
the
former
they
were
conquerors
intent
on
adding
him
to
their
list
of
conquests
but
if
the
latter
then
they
might
be
fugitives
like
himself
it
behooved
him
to
find
out
so
he
proceeded
to
a
slight
depression
in
the
very
near
the
group
of
formians
this
depression
contained
soil
and
in
it
he
scratched
in
porovian
shorthand
the
words
yuri
or
doggo
then
pointed
to
his
message
and
withdrew
for
a
slight
distance
one
of
the
advanced
alone
to
the
depression
stared
at
the
words
rubbed
one
part
of
them
and
returned
to
his
comrades
at
which
cabot
in
turn
advanced
the
one
word
remaining
written
in
the
dirt
was
yuri
so
these
were
victorious
enemies
rather
than
fugitive
friends
waving
a
signal
that
the
interview
was
at
an
end
myles
cabot
returned
with
dignity
to
the
shack
and
pulled
down
his
crossed
sticks
but
then
instead
of
entering
he
suddenly
dashed
around
the
house
and
slid
down
the
mountainside
amid
a
shower
of
pebbles
instantly
the
formian
pack
rushed
after
him
but
they
were
too
late
for
by
the
time
they
had
gained
the
crest
he
was
safely
under
cover
of
the
bushes
making
his
way
down
the
slope
with
his
rifle
ammunition
and
provision
the
evidently
feared
an
ambush
for
they
did
not
follow
this
side
of
the
mountain
the
eastern
was
wooded
instead
of
the
almost
impassable
boulders
over
which
he
had
climbed
up
the
other
side
two
days
ago
accordingly
the
descent
was
easy
almost
pleasant
soon
he
struck
a
path
beside
a
little
brook
and
followed
it
until
it
led
out
onto
the
fertile
eastern
plains
which
he
had
observed
when
first
he
had
topped
this
range
of
hills
beneath
a
large
tree
beside
the
brook
at
the
edge
of
the
plain
myles
cabot
stopped
and
sat
down
for
lunch
and
it
was
while
seated
thus
with
his
back
against
the
tree
trunk
that
an
arrow
suddenly
whistled
through
the
woods
and
imbedded
itself
in
the
bark
just
above
his
head
startled
he
sprang
to
his
feet
seized
his
rifle
and
looked
around
a
second
arrow
sped
through
the
air
and
this
one
did
not
miss
him
in
due
course
of
time
myles
regained
consciousness
he
was
lying
on
the
ground
beneath
the
same
tree
there
was
an
ugly
gash
in
his
head
his
rifle
ammunition
and
food
were
gone
his
face
and
body
were
covered
with
clotted
blood
and
he
felt
very
faint
with
difficulty
he
dragged
himself
to
the
stream
tore
off
a
piece
of
his
ragged
toga
and
washed
away
some
of
the
gore
but
it
required
an
almost
superhuman
effort
he
lay
on
the
bank
and
panted
his
head
swam
his
surroundings
began
to
blur
and
dance
about
and
then
he
swooned
again
after
what
seemed
an
interminable
time
he
became
dimly
conscious
that
he
was
lying
on
something
less
hard
than
the
ground
soft
arms
were
around
him
some
one
was
crooning
to
him
sweet
words
and
low
was
this
a
dream
or
was
he
back
once
more
in
cupia
with
his
loved
ones
vi
the
vairkings
myles
cabot
opened
his
weary
eyes
around
him
hung
barbaric
tapestries
he
was
lying
on
a
couch
covered
by
the
same
materials
seated
on
the
couch
beside
him
was
a
creature
human
in
form
but
covered
with
short
fur
it
seemed
to
be
a
young
woman
of
some
species
but
of
what
species
myles
threw
back
his
head
and
studied
the
creature
s
face
expecting
to
see
the
prognathous
features
of
some
anthropoid
ape
but
no
for
eyes
nose
mouth
ears
and
all
were
human
distinctly
human
and
of
high
type
they
might
have
been
the
features
of
an
except
for
the
fact
that
the
short
brown
fur
persisted
on
the
face
as
on
the
rest
of
the
body
the
general
effect
reminded
cabot
for
all
the
world
of
a
teddy
bear
yes
that
is
what
this
creature
was
an
animated
human
teddy
bear
seeing
cabot
looking
at
her
the
creature
smiled
down
at
him
and
murmured
some
strange
words
in
a
soothing
musical
voice
also
she
stroked
his
cheek
with
one
of
her
furry
paws
at
this
moment
the
hangings
parted
and
there
stepped
into
their
presence
a
man
of
the
species
wearing
a
leather
tunic
and
leather
helmet
and
carrying
a
wooden
spear
bowing
low
before
the
furry
lady
he
spoke
to
her
in
the
same
soft
tongue
which
she
had
employed
in
addressing
myles
not
a
single
syllable
was
familiar
to
the
but
he
caught
the
words
roy
and
vairking
repeated
a
number
of
times
and
also
made
out
that
the
furry
man
had
addressed
the
furry
lady
as
arkilu
now
arose
from
the
couch
and
taking
a
tablet
and
a
stick
of
charcoal
from
a
stand
wrote
some
characters
upon
a
sheet
of
paper
and
handed
it
to
the
man
who
bowed
and
withdrew
the
pad
and
charcoal
gave
myles
an
idea
if
he
was
to
stay
any
length
of
time
with
these
creatures
he
had
better
start
in
at
once
learning
both
their
written
and
their
spoken
language
and
perhaps
when
he
had
mastered
it
he
could
persuade
these
kindly
yet
warlike
folk
to
assist
him
against
the
formians
he
judged
that
they
were
kindly
because
of
the
actions
of
the
furry
lady
and
they
were
warlike
because
of
the
habiliments
of
the
furry
man
putting
his
idea
into
action
myles
sat
up
gathering
a
gaudy
blanket
about
his
shoulders
and
pointed
to
the
writing
materials
with
a
furry
smile
arkilu
brought
them
to
him
having
been
through
this
game
once
before
he
knew
just
where
to
begin
he
pointed
to
the
couch
and
handed
her
the
pad
and
charcoal
whereupon
the
lady
spoke
some
absolutely
unintelligible
sound
and
wrote
upon
the
pad
in
unmistakable
cupian
shorthand
the
familiar
cupian
word
for
couch
myles
could
hardly
believe
his
senses
he
stared
at
the
paper
rubbed
his
eyes
and
then
stared
again
how
was
it
that
this
creature
employed
a
written
character
identical
with
the
word
used
by
another
race
far
across
the
impassable
boiling
seas
to
designate
the
same
thing
but
perhaps
this
was
merely
a
coincidence
so
he
pointed
to
another
object
again
there
came
a
strange
sound
coupled
with
the
familiar
cupian
symbol
the
experiment
was
repeated
and
repeated
always
with
the
same
result
then
cabot
himself
took
the
writing
materials
and
inscribed
a
number
of
words
which
sounded
somewhat
alike
in
porovian
antenna
speech
to
these
words
arkilu
gave
an
entirely
different
set
of
similar
sounds
aha
said
cabot
to
himself
this
language
employs
exactly
the
same
words
as
are
used
on
our
continent
but
translates
the
of
these
words
into
entirely
different
sounds
cabot
s
interpretation
of
the
situation
proved
correct
in
the
main
which
fact
made
it
extremely
easy
for
him
to
master
the
new
language
already
he
could
carry
on
a
written
conversation
with
his
benefactress
and
before
long
it
became
possible
by
dint
of
great
care
for
him
to
talk
aloud
in
simple
sentences
of
course
all
this
progress
was
not
made
at
one
sitting
for
arkilu
insisted
that
her
patient
take
frequent
rests
from
time
to
time
meals
were
served
by
female
attendants
meals
abounding
in
strange
meats
mostly
lobsterlike
but
some
resembling
fish
and
flesh
each
night
arkilu
departed
leaving
a
furry
on
guard
with
leather
armor
and
wooden
spear
as
he
mastered
the
language
myles
learned
the
following
facts
from
arkilu
her
people
were
called
the
vairkings
and
she
was
the
eldest
daughter
of
theoph
their
ruler
the
vairkings
were
a
primitive
race
apparently
they
knew
nothing
of
any
of
the
metals
but
had
made
considerable
progress
in
the
arts
of
tanning
weaving
and
carpentry
the
fact
that
they
had
made
cloth
accounted
for
the
fact
that
they
had
paper
their
leather
they
had
obtained
from
the
hides
of
a
large
variety
of
nocturnal
reptiles
known
indiscriminately
as
gnoopers
and
ranging
in
size
from
that
of
a
cat
to
that
of
an
elephant
though
all
possessed
the
common
characteristics
of
small
heads
long
necks
stumpy
legs
and
long
heavy
tails
she
explained
as
follows
to
her
guest
how
he
had
been
rescued
our
home
is
in
the
city
of
vairkingi
far
away
a
little
east
of
north
from
here
we
vairkings
stick
pretty
close
to
the
cities
for
the
great
open
spaces
of
our
land
are
inhabited
by
predatory
tribes
of
wild
creatures
very
like
ourselves
called
roies
the
leader
of
one
of
the
largest
tribes
of
these
att
the
terrible
sought
alliance
with
my
father
and
as
the
price
of
this
alliance
a
union
between
att
and
myself
but
i
spurned
him
his
hordes
then
attacked
vairkingi
but
we
repulsed
them
and
drove
them
to
the
southward
at
present
we
are
on
a
punitive
expedition
into
their
territory
our
warriors
are
under
the
command
of
jud
the
and
my
father
theoph
the
grim
and
i
have
accompanied
the
headquarters
so
as
to
witness
the
downfall
of
att
the
terrible
it
was
undoubtedly
one
of
the
roies
who
wounded
you
but
the
approach
of
our
men
drove
them
off
before
they
had
time
to
do
you
further
harm
it
was
i
myself
who
found
you
lying
beside
the
brook
and
i
would
fain
possess
you
as
my
own
you
who
are
unlike
any
man
whom
i
have
ever
seen
whence
come
you
i
am
from
the
planet
minos
o
arkilu
the
beautiful
replied
cabot
but
the
princess
incredulously
shook
her
head
saying
i
know
not
whereof
you
speak
nor
know
i
the
meaning
of
the
word
there
are
no
other
worlds
than
this
continent
which
we
inhabit
surrounded
by
boiling
seas
on
all
sides
though
rumor
says
that
strange
beasts
from
somewhere
have
landed
and
are
building
a
city
to
the
eastward
of
the
rumor
has
it
right
myles
laconically
interjected
for
i
had
just
escaped
from
those
beasts
when
i
was
wounded
by
the
arrow
of
the
arkilu
opened
her
eyes
in
wonder
tell
me
about
them
she
breathed
so
the
sat
up
swathed
in
the
gaudy
tapestries
of
the
vairkings
and
related
to
the
furry
princess
the
story
of
his
adventures
on
the
planet
poros
it
was
difficult
to
put
it
all
into
words
within
her
comprehension
for
neither
she
nor
her
people
could
know
anything
of
radio
of
the
solar
system
of
airplanes
or
of
rifles
accordingly
his
account
ran
about
as
follows
know
o
princess
that
there
is
another
land
called
minos
or
in
our
own
language
the
earth
far
above
those
silver
clouds
one
million
times
the
distance
from
here
to
your
capital
city
vairkingi
also
there
is
beyond
the
boiling
seas
another
land
much
like
this
where
dwell
hairless
men
called
cupians
and
also
the
black
beasts
to
whom
you
have
referred
these
beasts
are
called
formians
cupians
and
formians
can
not
talk
with
their
mouths
as
you
and
i
nor
do
they
have
ears
to
hear
with
instead
they
communicate
by
a
kind
of
soundless
magic
called
radio
but
they
write
the
same
language
as
do
you
vairkings
on
the
earth
i
was
master
of
this
magic
radio
but
one
day
my
own
magic
proved
too
strong
for
me
and
shot
me
through
the
skies
to
formia
where
the
formians
captured
me
i
found
that
the
cupians
were
the
slaves
of
the
formians
by
means
of
radio
i
was
able
to
talk
with
both
races
i
escaped
from
the
formians
by
other
magic
which
could
throw
small
black
stones
faster
than
arrows
and
with
more
deadly
results
i
led
the
cupians
to
victory
over
their
oppressors
their
princess
lilla
became
my
bride
and
our
son
kew
now
sits
on
the
throne
of
cupia
but
prince
yuri
a
renegade
cupian
rebelled
against
us
for
he
too
loved
lilla
myles
continued
yuri
and
his
allies
possessed
magic
wagons
which
could
fly
through
the
what
is
fly
arkilu
interrupted
if
you
mean
swim
it
is
impossible
for
no
creature
ever
lived
which
could
swim
in
ah
but
this
is
magic
you
must
remember
he
assured
her
have
you
vairkings
never
seen
any
peculiar
black
objects
sailing
through
the
sky
since
the
rumored
arrival
of
the
formians
on
your
continent
arkilu
pursed
her
lips
in
thought
yes
she
admitted
there
have
been
rumors
of
that
well
he
continued
those
were
the
flying
wagons
of
the
formians
when
we
finally
defeated
them
and
drove
them
across
the
boiling
seas
in
these
wagons
i
revisited
the
planet
earth
by
means
of
the
radio
magic
of
which
i
have
told
you
but
on
my
attempted
return
to
cupia
i
landed
on
your
continent
instead
by
mistake
and
was
again
captured
by
my
formian
enemies
of
my
escape
from
them
my
wounding
by
the
roy
arrow
and
my
rescue
by
you
you
already
arkilu
smiled
ingratiatingly
you
are
a
pretty
spinner
of
tales
therefore
i
shall
keep
you
to
amuse
me
methinks
that
even
theoph
the
grim
will
revel
in
your
and
she
leaned
over
and
caressed
cabot
s
cheek
with
one
furry
hand
he
cringed
at
the
touch
yet
strove
not
to
offend
her
whose
continued
friendship
might
mean
so
much
toward
his
return
to
his
own
country
he
wanted
her
good
will
and
her
influence
but
out
of
loyalty
to
lilla
he
dreaded
her
love
to
change
the
subject
he
inquired
when
shall
i
be
well
enough
to
get
up
you
are
well
enough
now
she
replied
try
to
at
myles
s
insistence
a
leather
suit
was
sent
for
he
soon
found
himself
dressed
like
a
soldier
of
the
vairkings
thus
arrayed
he
stood
and
walked
about
a
little
inside
the
tent
but
arkilu
would
not
permit
him
to
venture
outside
until
he
should
be
stronger
before
leaving
for
the
night
arkilu
announced
tomorrow
our
expedition
starts
back
for
vairkingi
when
we
reach
the
city
i
shall
marry
you
for
i
have
decided
that
i
love
vii
radio
once
more
so
arkilu
the
furry
beauty
planned
to
marry
myles
cabot
the
he
who
already
loved
and
was
wed
to
lilla
of
cupia
a
happy
prospect
indeed
yet
he
dared
not
repulse
the
vairkingian
maiden
lest
thereby
he
lose
his
chance
of
returning
to
his
home
and
family
for
at
last
he
had
formulated
a
plan
of
action
namely
to
arm
the
hordes
of
vairkingia
lead
them
against
the
seize
an
and
with
it
fly
back
to
cupia
so
for
the
present
he
appeared
to
fall
in
with
the
matrimonial
whim
of
the
princess
early
the
next
morning
however
as
he
was
prowling
around
inside
the
tent
testing
his
weak
legs
he
overheard
a
conversation
on
the
outside
which
changed
the
situation
considerably
but
father
remonstrated
a
voice
which
myles
recognized
as
that
of
arkilu
i
found
him
and
therefore
he
is
mine
i
want
him
he
is
beautiful
beautiful
humph
a
stern
male
voice
sarcastically
replied
he
be
without
any
fur
oh
to
think
that
my
royal
daughter
would
wish
to
wed
a
freak
of
nature
and
a
common
soldier
at
that
he
s
a
common
soldier
asserted
the
voice
of
arkilu
he
wears
clothes
merely
so
as
to
preserve
his
health
for
my
well
a
sickly
cripple
then
answered
her
father
s
voice
which
is
just
as
bad
at
all
events
jud
is
the
leader
of
this
expedition
and
therefore
this
captive
belongs
to
him
you
can
have
him
only
if
jud
so
wills
it
is
the
myles
cabot
stealthily
crossed
the
tent
and
put
his
eye
to
an
opening
between
the
curtains
at
the
tent
opening
there
stood
the
familiar
figure
of
arkilu
and
confronting
her
was
a
massive
male
vairking
fur
however
was
snow
white
so
that
his
general
appearance
resembled
that
of
a
polar
bear
his
face
was
appropriately
harsh
and
cold
this
was
theoph
the
grim
ruler
of
the
vairkings
the
dispute
continued
and
then
there
approached
another
man
of
the
species
the
newcomer
was
short
squat
and
gnarled
yet
possessed
of
unquestionable
intelligence
and
a
certain
dignity
which
clearly
indicated
that
he
was
of
noble
rank
he
wore
a
leather
helmet
and
carried
a
wooden
lance
theoph
the
grim
hailed
him
with
ho
jud
what
brings
you
here
jud
raised
his
spear
diagonally
across
his
chest
as
a
salute
and
replied
a
change
of
plans
excellency
upon
reaching
the
river
i
decided
that
it
would
be
wiser
not
to
return
to
vairkingi
by
that
really
meaning
arkilu
interposed
with
a
laugh
that
you
found
it
impossible
to
throw
a
bridge
across
at
that
why
do
you
always
doubt
the
reasons
for
my
actions
jud
asked
in
an
aggrieved
tone
you
wrong
me
she
replied
i
never
doubt
your
reasons
your
are
always
of
the
best
what
i
doubt
is
your
enough
enough
the
king
shouted
for
i
wish
to
discuss
more
immediate
matters
than
nice
distinctions
of
language
jud
s
reasons
or
excuses
or
whatever
are
good
enough
for
me
jud
i
wish
to
inform
you
that
my
daughter
has
recently
captured
a
strange
furless
being
whom
it
is
my
pleasure
to
turn
over
to
you
i
have
not
yet
seen
this
father
please
arkilu
begged
but
at
this
juncture
myles
exasperated
by
theoph
s
remarks
parted
the
tent
curtains
and
stepped
out
look
well
oh
king
he
shouted
here
stands
myles
cabot
the
minorian
beast
from
another
world
freak
of
nature
sickly
cripple
common
soldier
and
all
that
look
well
o
king
a
bit
loud
mouthed
i
should
say
theoph
the
grim
sniffed
not
one
whit
abashed
watch
him
crumple
at
the
presence
of
a
real
man
added
jud
the
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
the
latter
stepped
over
to
myles
and
suddenly
slapped
him
on
the
face
as
a
boy
the
had
often
seen
larger
boys
point
to
their
cheek
or
shoulder
with
the
words
there
is
an
electric
button
there
touch
it
and
something
will
fly
out
and
hit
but
never
as
a
boy
had
he
dared
to
press
the
magic
button
for
he
could
well
imagine
the
result
such
a
result
now
occurred
to
jud
for
the
instant
his
fingers
touched
cabot
s
cheek
out
flew
cabot
s
clenched
fist
smack
to
the
point
of
jud
s
jaw
and
tumbled
him
in
the
dust
jud
picked
himself
up
snarling
shook
himself
and
then
rushed
at
the
who
stood
his
ground
ducked
the
flying
arms
of
his
antagonist
and
tackled
him
as
in
the
old
football
days
at
college
jud
was
thrown
for
a
loss
with
much
of
the
breath
knocked
out
of
his
body
theoph
the
grim
with
a
worried
frown
and
arkilu
the
beautiful
with
an
entranced
smile
stood
by
and
watched
the
contest
the
vairking
noble
lay
motionless
on
his
back
as
myles
scrambled
to
his
knees
astride
the
other
s
body
and
placed
his
hands
on
the
other
s
shoulders
but
suddenly
the
underdog
threw
up
his
left
leg
caught
myles
on
the
right
shoulder
and
pushed
him
backward
in
an
instant
both
men
were
on
their
feet
again
glaring
at
each
other
then
they
clinched
and
went
down
once
more
this
time
with
jud
on
top
theoph
s
look
changed
to
a
smile
and
arkilu
became
worried
but
before
jud
had
time
to
follow
up
his
advantage
cabot
secured
a
hammerlock
around
his
neck
and
shoulders
and
then
slowly
forced
him
to
one
side
until
their
positions
were
reversed
and
the
shoulders
and
hips
of
the
furry
one
were
squarely
touching
the
ground
in
a
wrestling
match
this
would
have
constituted
a
victory
for
myles
cabot
but
this
was
a
fight
and
not
a
mere
wrestling
match
so
the
secured
a
hammerlock
again
and
turned
jud
the
over
until
he
lay
prone
whereupon
the
victor
rubbed
the
nose
of
the
vanquished
back
and
forth
in
the
dirt
until
he
heard
a
muffled
sound
which
he
took
to
be
the
vairkingian
equivalent
of
the
nuff
so
familiar
to
every
pugnacious
american
schoolboy
his
honor
satisfied
cabot
arose
brushed
himself
off
and
bowed
to
the
two
spectators
jud
sheepishly
got
to
his
feet
as
well
all
the
fight
knocked
out
of
him
theoph
stared
at
the
victor
with
displeasure
and
at
his
own
countryman
with
disgust
but
arkilu
rushed
over
to
cabot
with
a
little
cry
flung
her
arms
around
him
and
drew
him
within
the
tent
as
they
passed
through
the
curtains
myles
heard
jud
the
explaining
to
the
king
i
decided
to
let
him
beat
me
so
that
thereby
i
might
give
pleasure
to
her
whom
i
inside
the
tent
arkilu
bathed
the
scratches
and
bruises
of
the
and
hovered
around
him
and
fussed
over
him
as
though
he
had
accomplished
something
much
more
wonderful
than
merely
to
have
come
out
on
top
in
a
schoolboy
fight
myles
was
very
sorry
that
it
all
had
happened
in
the
first
place
he
had
lost
his
temper
which
was
to
his
discredit
in
the
second
place
he
had
made
a
hero
of
himself
in
the
eyes
of
the
lady
whose
love
he
was
most
anxious
to
avoid
and
in
the
third
place
he
had
fought
the
man
who
was
best
calculated
to
protect
him
from
that
undesired
love
altogether
he
had
made
a
mess
of
things
and
all
he
could
do
about
it
was
meekly
submit
to
the
ministrations
of
the
furry
princess
what
a
life
finally
arkilu
departed
leaving
cabot
alone
with
recriminations
for
his
rashness
longings
for
his
own
princess
lilla
and
worries
for
her
safety
the
next
day
the
expedition
took
up
its
delayed
start
homeward
jud
having
found
a
route
which
required
no
alibis
the
tents
were
struck
and
were
piled
with
the
other
impedimenta
on
carts
which
the
common
soldiers
pulled
with
long
ropes
in
spite
of
arkilu
s
pleadings
myles
was
assigned
to
one
of
these
gangs
theoph
grimly
remarking
if
the
hairless
one
is
well
enough
to
vanquish
jud
he
is
well
enough
to
do
his
share
of
the
jud
explained
to
arkilu
that
the
real
reason
why
he
had
suggested
this
was
that
he
sincerely
believed
that
the
exercise
would
be
good
for
cabot
s
health
during
one
of
the
halts
when
jud
happened
to
be
near
cabot
s
gang
the
strode
over
to
the
commander
who
instinctively
cringed
at
his
approach
i
m
not
fighting
myles
assured
the
vairking
with
an
engaging
smile
but
may
i
have
a
word
with
you
so
the
two
withdrew
a
short
distance
out
of
earshot
of
the
rest
and
myles
continued
i
do
not
love
arkilu
the
beautiful
you
do
let
us
understand
one
another
and
help
one
another
you
assist
me
keep
away
from
the
princess
and
i
shall
assist
you
keeping
away
from
the
princess
later
i
shall
make
further
suggestions
as
to
how
we
can
cooperate
to
mutual
advantage
i
have
jud
stared
at
him
with
perplexed
admiration
who
are
you
he
asked
who
stands
unabashed
in
the
presence
of
kings
and
nobles
who
addresses
a
superior
without
permission
and
yet
without
offensive
familiarity
i
am
cabot
the
minorian
the
other
replied
ruler
over
cupia
a
nation
larger
and
more
powerful
than
yours
a
race
of
fearsome
beasts
have
landed
on
the
western
shores
of
your
continent
they
are
enemies
of
mine
and
will
become
enemies
of
yours
as
they
extend
their
civilization
and
run
counter
to
impossible
jud
exclaimed
for
how
could
these
mythical
creatures
cross
the
boiling
seas
to
land
on
our
shores
by
magic
answered
myles
magic
which
they
stole
from
me
and
they
held
me
prisoner
until
i
overthrew
their
magic
and
escaped
to
be
found
by
your
then
you
are
a
magician
ah
that
explains
how
you
defeated
me
in
combat
yesterday
jud
asserted
with
a
relieved
sigh
we
will
let
it
go
at
that
myles
agreed
smiling
but
to
continue
let
me
frankly
warn
you
that
unless
you
destroy
these
formians
they
will
eventually
destroy
you
they
now
possess
magic
against
which
you
vairkings
would
be
powerless
magic
methods
of
soundless
speech
magic
devices
for
transmitting
that
speech
as
far
as
from
here
to
vairkingi
magic
wagons
which
can
travel
through
the
air
and
at
such
a
speed
that
they
could
go
from
here
to
vairkingi
and
back
in
a
twelfth
part
of
a
day
and
magic
bows
which
shoot
pellets
faster
than
the
speed
of
sound
and
which
can
outrange
your
bows
and
arrows

to
one
but
if
you
will
give
a
workroom
and
keep
arkilu
away
from

devise
magic
which
will
overcome
magic
and
which
will
make
vairkingi
the
unquestioned
master
of
this
whole
continent
in
spite
of
the
roies
and
the
formians
then
i
shall
seize
one
of
the
formian
magic
wagons
fly
back
in
it
to
my
own
country
and
leave
you
in
peaceful
dominion
over
this
continent
what
do
you
say
i
say
the
vairking
replied
that
you
are
an
amusing
fellow
and
an
able
spinner
of
yarns
but
you
talk
with
evident
earnestness
and
sincerity
therefore
i
shall
give
you
your
workshop
and
your
materials
but
on
one
condition
namely
that
you
entertain
us
likewise
i
have
and
thus
it
came
to
pass
that
jud
the
attached
the
to
his
personal
retinue
and
placed
a
laboratory
at
his
disposal
upon
the
return
arrival
of
the
expedition
at
vairkingi
this
city
was
built
entirely
of
wood
it
was
surrounded
by
a
high
stockade
and
was
divided
by
stockades
into
sections
each
presided
over
by
a
noble
save
only
the
central
section
which
housed
the
retinue
of
theoph
himself
within
the
sections
each
family
had
its
own
enclosure
all
streets
and
alleys
passed
between
high
wooded
walls
the
buildings
and
fences
were
carved
and
gaudily
colored
as
the
returning
expedition
approached
the
great
wall
they
were
met
by
blasts
of
trumpet
music
from
the
parapets
then
a
huge
gate
opened
and
they
passed
inside
here
they
quickly
separated
and
each
detachment
hastened
to
the
quarter
of
the
nobleman
from
whom
they
had
been
drawn
jud
and
his
detachment
proceeded
down
many
a
street
until
they
came
to
a
gate
bearing
the
insignia
of
jud
himself
inside
there
were
more
streets
of
the
same
character
through
which
jud
s
retinue
dispersed
to
the
gates
of
their
own
little
inclosures
until
jud
and
myles
cabot
were
left
alone
the
noble
led
his
new
acquisition
to
a
gate
this
inclosure
is
vacant
jud
explained
it
will
be
yours
enter
and
take
possession
within
you
will
find
a
small
house
and
a
shop
serving
maids
will
be
sent
from
my
own
household
to
make
you
comfortable
repair
to
my
palace
and
tell
me
some
more
stories
meanwhile
for
the
and
he
strode
off
and
disappeared
around
a
bend
in
the
street
cabot
passed
in
through
the
gate
he
found
a
well
from
which
he
drew
water
to
fill
a
carefully
fashioned
wooden
pool
scarce
had
he
finished
bathing
when
a
group
of
furry
girls
arrived
from
the
house
of
his
patron
bearing
brooms
and
blankets
and
food
one
of
them
also
bore
a
note
which
read
as
follows
if
you
love
me
you
will
find
a
way
to
reach
me
arkilu
and
if
not
what
said
myles
to
himself
after
he
had
rested
and
dined
and
the
place
had
been
made
thoroughly
neat
all
the
girls
withdrew
save
the
one
who
had
brought
the
note
she
informed
him
that
her
name
was
quivven
and
that
she
had
been
ordered
to
remain
in
the
inclosure
as
his
servant
she
was
small
and
lithe
her
hair
was
a
brilliant
and
her
eyes
were
blue
if
it
had
not
been
for
her
fur
she
would
have
passed
for
a
twin
to
his
own
lilla
this
fact
brought
an
intense
pang
to
him
and
caused
such
a
wave
of
homesickness
that
he
sat
down
on
a
couch
and
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
but
the
pretty
creature
made
no
attempt
to
comfort
him
instead
she
merely
remarked
half
aloud
to
herself
i
wonder
what
arkilu
can
possibly
see
in
him
even
att
the
terrible
is
much
more
finally
myles
arose
with
more
determination
and
courage
than
he
had
felt
at
any
time
since
his
return
to
poros
guided
by
quivven
he
set
out
for
jud
s
dwelling
firmly
resolved
to
take
steps
that
very
night
which
should
result
eventually
in
his
reaching
cupia
and
rescuing
his
family
from
the
renegade
yuri
jud
s
palace
was
elaborate
and
barbaric
jud
himself
was
seated
on
a
divan
surrounded
by
vairkingian
beauties
they
all
were
frankly
inquisitive
to
see
this
hairless
creature
from
another
world
yet
they
rather
turned
up
their
pretty
noses
at
him
when
they
found
him
dressed
like
a
common
soldier
cabot
regaled
the
gathering
with
an
account
of
his
first
arrival
on
poros
and
of
the
two
wars
of
liberation
which
had
freed
cupia
from
the
domination
of
the
ants
all
the
while
he
was
most
eager
to
get
down
to
business
with
the
noble
yet
he
realized
that
he
had
been
employed
for
a
definite
purpose
namely
and
that
his
first
duty
was
to
please
his
patron
finally
the
ladies
withdrew
and
myles
cabot
the
radio
man
began
the
first
discussion
of
radio
that
he
had
undertaken
since
his
return
to
poros
viii
but
why
radio
three
fields
of
were
open
to
him
aviation
and
radio
the
opportunity
for
building
a
workable
airplane
among
people
who
knew
no
metal
arts
was
obviously
slight
to
make
a
radio
set
should
be
possible
if
he
could
find
certain
minerals
and
other
natural
products
which
ought
to
be
available
in
almost
any
country
but
easiest
of
all
would
be
to
extract
iron
from
the
ore
which
he
had
observed
on
his
journey
across
the
mountains
forge
rifle
barrels
and
simple
breech
mechanisms
and
make
gunpowder
and
bullets
therefore
it
is
plain
why
he
did
not
attempt
to
build
airships
but
it
is
hard
to
see
why
he
did
not
make
firearms
rather
than
a
radio
set
firearms
would
have
enabled
him
to
equip
the
vairkings
for
battle
against
the
formians
whereas
radio
could
serve
no
useful
purpose
at
the
moment
yet
he
took
up
radio
i
think
the
explanation
lies
in
two
facts
first
he
wanted
above
all
to
get
in
touch
with
his
home
in
cupia
find
out
the
status
of
affairs
there
and
give
courage
to
his
wife
and
his
supporters
if
any
of
them
remained
and
secondly
he
was
primarily
a
radio
engineer
and
so
his
thoughts
naturally
turned
to
radio
and
minimized
its
difficulties
there
would
be
plenty
of
time
to
arm
the
vairkings
after
he
found
out
how
affairs
stood
at
home
so
he
broached
to
jud
his
project
of
constructing
a
radio
set
which
would
necessitate
extended
journeys
in
search
of
materials
but
the
vairking
noble
was
singularly
uninterested
i
know
that
you
can
spin
interesting
yarns
he
said
but
i
do
not
know
whether
you
can
do
magic
why
then
should
i
deprive
myself
of
the
pleasure
of
listening
to
your
stories
just
for
the
sake
of
letting
you
amuse
yourself
in
a
probably
impossible
pursuit
first
you
must
convince
me
that
you
are
a
magician
then
perhaps
i
may
consent
to
your
attempting
further
very
well
the
replied
tomorrow
evening
i
shall
display
to
you
some
of
the
more
simple
examples
of
my
art
meanwhile
i
shall
spend
my
time
concocting
mystic
spells
in
preparation
for
the
then
he
bowed
and
withdrew
thanking
his
lucky
stars
that
he
had
learned
a
few
tricks
of
while
at
college
myles
now
recalled
several
of
these
and
devoted
most
of
the
succeeding
day
to
preparing
a
few
simple
bits
of
apparatus
then
he
practiced
his
tricks
before
the
quivven
to
her
complete
mystification
that
evening
he
went
again
to
the
quarters
of
jud
the
the
same
group
was
there
as
on
the
evening
before
and
in
addition
several
other
vairking
men
and
their
wives
after
an
introduction
by
his
host
the
started
in
first
he
did
in
rapid
succession
some
simple
variations
of
he
had
wanted
to
perform
the
restoration
of
the
cut
handkerchief
but
unfortunately
the
vairkings
possessed
neither
handkerchiefs
nor
scissors
and
he
was
forced
to
improvise
a
variant
taking
a
piece
of
stick
which
he
had
brought
with
him
for
a
wand
he
stuffed
a
small
part
of
one
of
the
gaudy
hangings
through
his
closed
left
fist
between
the
thumb
and
forefinger
so
that
it
projected
in
a
point
about
two
inches
beyond
his
hand
then
pulling
the
curtain
over
toward
one
of
the
stone
lamps
which
illuminated
the
chamber
he
completely
burned
off
the
projecting
bit
of
doth
evidently
this
was
one
of
jud
s
choicest
tapestries
for
the
noble
emitted
a
howl
of
grief
and
rage
and
leaped
from
his
divan
scattering
the
reclining
beauties
in
both
directions
if
he
had
interfered
in
time
to
prevent
the
burning
it
would
have
spoiled
the
trick
but
as
it
was
the
confusion
caused
by
his
onrush
played
right
into
cabot
s
hands
myles
stepped
back
in
apparent
terror
as
jud
seized
his
precious
curtain
and
hunted
for
the
scorched
hole
but
there
was
no
hole
there
the
curtain
was
intact
jud
looked
up
sheepishly
into
the
triumphant
face
of
his
protégé
who
thereupon
stated
you
did
not
need
to
worry
about
your
property
in
the
hands
of
a
true
oh
i
was
not
afraid
jud
the
explained
i
merely
pretended
fear
so
as
to
try
and
confuse
your
please
do
not
do
it
again
the
sternly
admonished
him
the
vairking
noble
seated
himself
again
his
guests
were
enthralled
this
was
a
fitting
climax
for
the
evening
the
amateur
conjurer
bowed
low
and
withdrew
quivven
was
waiting
for
him
at
his
house
and
reported
that
some
one
had
torn
a
small
piece
out
of
one
of
the
tapestries
several
days
later
she
found
the
piece
but
alas
there
was
a
hole
burnt
in
the
middle
of
it
the
next
morning
jud
the
called
at
the
quarters
of
cabot
the
furless
it
was
a
rare
honor
so
cabot
answered
the
door
in
person
jud
expressed
his
conviction
that
the
really
was
a
magician
after
all
and
that
therefore
agreeable
to
an
expedition
to
the
mountains
in
search
of
rocks
whose
mystical
properties
would
enable
the
performing
of
even
greater
magic
it
was
soon
arranged
that
cabot
with
a
bodyguard
of
some
twenty
vairking
soldiers
and
a
officer
should
start
on
the
morrow
myles
was
thrilled
now
he
was
getting
somewhere
at
last
the
rest
of
the
day
he
devoted
to
preparing
a
list
of
the
materials
for
which
he
must
hunt
to
make
a
sending
and
receiving
set
he
would
need
dielectrics
copper
wire
batteries
tubes
and
iron
for
dielectrics
wood
and
mica
would
suffice
wood
was
common
and
the
vairkings
were
skilled
carpenters
and
carvers
for
fine
insulation
mica
would
be
ideal
and
this
mineral
ought
to
be
procurable
somewhere
in
the
mountains
whose
general
nature
he
had
observed
to
be
granitic
to
make
copper
wire
he
would
need
copper
limestone
and
fuel
the
necessary
furnaces
he
would
built
of
brick
any
one
can
bake
clay
into
bricks
for
cement
myles
finally
hit
upon
using
a
baked
and
ground
mixture
of
limestone
and
clay
both
of
which
ingredients
he
would
have
at
hand
for
other
purposes
the
vairkings
used
charcoal
in
their
open
fires
and
this
would
do
nicely
for
his
fuel
for
the
dies
he
would
use
steel
this
disposed
of
the
copper
questions
and
brought
him
to
a
consideration
of
iron
which
he
would
need
at
various
places
in
his
apparatus
this
metal
could
be
smelted
from
the
slag
of
the
copper
furnaces
using
an
appropriate
flux
such
as
fluorspar
cabot
next
turned
his
attention
to
his
power
source
for
some
time
he
debated
the
question
of
whether
or
not
to
build
a
dynamo
but
how
about
the
storage
batteries
he
wasn
t
quite
sure
how
to
find
or
make
the
necessary
red
and
yellow
lead
salts
for
the
packing
plates
thus
by
the
time
that
cabot
reached
the
contemplation
of
having
either
to
find
or
make
his
lead
compounds
he
decided
to
turn
his
attention
to
primary
cells
the
jars
could
be
made
of
pottery
or
from
the
glass
which
was
going
to
be
necessary
for
his
tubes
anyhow
charcoal
would
furnish
the
carbon
elements
zinc
could
easily
be
distilled
from
zincspar
if
that
particular
form
of
ore
were
found
sal
ammoniac
solution
could
be
made
from
the
ammonia
of
animal
refuse
common
salt
and
sulphuric
acid
mass
production
of
zinc
carbon
batteries
should
thus
be
an
easy
matter
and
they
would
serve
perfectly
satisfactorily
as
neither
compactness
nor
portability
was
a
requisite
the
radio
man
accordingly
abandoned
the
idea
of
dynamos
and
accumulators
in
favor
of
large
quantities
of
wet
cells
the
tubes
it
appeared
to
myles
would
present
the
greatest
problem
platinum
for
the
filaments
grids
and
plates
had
been
fairly
common
in
nugget
form
in
cupia
and
so
presumably
could
be
found
in
vairkingia
glass
of
course
would
be
easy
to
make
alcohol
for
laboratory
burners
could
be
distilled
from
decayed
fruit
but
the
chief
stumbling
block
was
how
to
exhaust
the
air
from
his
tubes
and
how
to
secure
magnesium
to
use
in
completing
the
vacuum
these
matters
he
would
have
to
leave
to
the
future
in
the
hope
of
a
chance
idea
for
the
present
there
were
enough
elements
to
be
collected
so
that
he
would
be
kept
busy
for
a
great
many
days
accordingly
he
copied
off
the
following
two
lists
materials
readily
available
wood
wood
ashes
charcoal
clay
common
salt
white
sand
animal
refuse
decayed
fruit
materials
to
hunt
for
mica
copper
ore
quartz
limestone
fluorspar
galena
zinc
ore
platinum
chalk
magnesium
but
that
afternoon
all
his
plans
were
disrupted
by
a
message
reading
to
the
furless
one
you
are
directed
to
appear
for
my
amusement
at
my
palace
fail
not
theoph
the
grim
that
puts
an
end
to
my
trip
he
said
to
quivven
how
do
you
suppose
his
majesty
got
wind
that
i
am
a
conjurer
one
of
the
guests
at
the
show
last
night
must
have
told
him
she
replied
but
something
in
her
tone
of
voice
caused
myles
to
look
at
her
intently
and
something
in
her
expression
caused
him
to
say
you
know
more
than
you
tell
out
with
it
whereat
quivven
shrugged
her
pretty
golden
shoulders
and
replied
why
deceive
you
though
you
are
so
stupid
that
it
is
very
easy
who
brought
you
the
note
from
arkilu
the
night
of
your
arrival
here
you
did
cabot
answered
why
didn
t
i
put
two
and
two
together
before
then
you
are
connected
in
some
way
with
arkilu
she
laughed
contemptuously
how
did
you
guess
it
she
taunted
yes
one
would
rather
say
i
am
connected
in
some
way
with
arkilu
for
i
am
her
sister
set
here
to
spy
on
you
by
connivance
with
the
chief
woman
of
jud
s
servants
who
is
an
old
nurse
of
ours
i
am
quivven
the
golden
flame
daughter
of
theoph
the
grim
and
it
is
from
that
he
learned
of
your
mystic
abilities
what
do
you
think
of
beast
i
think
myles
said
noncommittally
that
although
you
truly
are
a
golden
flame
you
ought
to
have
been
named
quivven
the
pepper
pot
whereat
she
suddenly
burst
into
tears
and
rushed
out
of
the
room
funny
girl
myles
commented
to
himself
as
he
laid
aside
the
list
prepared
for
his
prospecting
trip
and
set
about
the
concoction
of
some
stage
properties
for
his
forthcoming
command
performance
before
the
king
it
was
a
sulky
quivven
who
served
his
meal
that
evening
so
much
so
that
cabot
playfully
accused
her
of
putting
poison
in
his
stew
this
did
not
render
her
any
more
gracious
however
if
i
did
not
love
my
sister
very
much
she
asserted
i
would
not
stand
for
you
for
one
the
rest
of
the
meal
was
eaten
in
silence
during
which
cabot
had
an
idea
so
when
the
food
had
been
cleared
away
he
asked
the
aureate
maiden
can
you
smuggle
a
note
to
your
sister
for
me
yes
she
assented
gloomily
and
i
shall
tell
her
how
you
are
treating
at
which
he
could
not
refrain
from
remarking
do
you
know
quivven
i
believe
that
you
are
falling
in
love
with
you
beast
she
cried
at
him
oh
i
hate
you
i
hate
you
i
hate
you
and
she
turned
her
face
to
the
wall
come
come
said
cabot
soothingly
i
don
t
mean
to
tease
you
and
we
must
both
think
of
your
sister
the
note
how
long
will
it
take
you
to
deliver
it
and
return
shall
i
hurry
she
asked
guardedly
then
it
will
take
me
less
than
of
a
that
would
be
quite
sufficient
for
his
plans
accordingly
he
wrote
arkilu
the
beautiful
send
word
how
i
can
see
you
after
the
performance
but
beware
of
jud
cabot
the
magician
this
note
he
folded
up
placed
it
in
the
palm
of
quivven
and
closed
her
golden
fingers
over
it
whereat
she
sprang
back
with
don
t
you
dare
touch
me
like
that
and
rushed
out
of
the
house
sobbing
angrily
really
he
must
be
more
careful
with
this
delicate
creature
for
although
her
intense
hatred
furnished
him
considerable
amusement
yet
it
was
possible
to
go
too
far
he
must
at
least
be
polite
to
the
sister
of
his
benefactress
but
there
was
no
time
to
be
given
over
to
worrying
about
quivven
s
sensitive
feelings
for
the
note
had
been
sent
merely
to
give
him
a
slight
respite
from
her
prying
eyes
in
order
that
he
might
sneak
out
for
a
conference
with
jud
of
course
he
had
no
intention
of
any
secret
tryst
with
arkilu
heaven
forbid
when
he
loved
his
own
distant
lilla
so
intensely
so
he
hurried
to
the
quarters
of
the
vairkingian
noble
who
received
him
gladly
being
most
interested
in
learning
whether
there
was
any
rational
explanation
to
be
given
to
the
various
magic
tricks
of
the
evening
before
but
myles
blocked
his
inquisitiveness
by
the
flat
assertion
that
all
were
due
to
mystic
spells
and
talismans
alone
and
then
got
rapidly
down
to
business
for
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
myles
told
jud
of
the
note
from
theoph
the
grim
requiring
his
presence
at
the
royal
palace
and
how
he
suspected
that
princess
arkilu
was
responsible
also
he
related
his
discovery
that
his
maidservant
was
quivven
the
golden
flame
but
he
had
the
decency
to
refrain
from
implicating
the
head
of
jud
s
ménage
i
shall
have
her
removed
at
once
the
vairking
asserted
no
no
myles
hastily
interposed
that
would
never
do
for
now
that
we
know
she
is
a
spy
it
will
be
easy
to
outwit
her
but
a
new
one
we
never
could
be
sure
then
he
told
how
he
had
gotten
rid
of
quivven
for
the
evening
by
sending
her
with
a
note
to
arkilu
jud
s
brow
darkened
but
myles
insisted
that
note
will
serve
a
purpose
first
it
has
enabled
me
undetected
to
pay
this
visit
to
you
secondly
it
will
allay
arkilu
s
suspicions
and
thirdly
it
will
stir
you
to
block
my
appearance
before
theoph
oh
i
would
have
done
that
anyhow
jud
insisted
my
plans
are
all
made
i
shall
send
a
runner
to
theoph
and
warn
him
to
search
arkilu
s
room
for
your
note
when
he
finds
the
note
he
will
certainly
cancel
the
arrangements
for
your
performance
thus
will
the
note
serve
a
return
now
to
your
quarters
and
i
will
send
you
word
of
the
i
wouldn
t
if
i
were
you
myles
admonished
for
a
message
from
you
would
reveal
to
our
fair
young
spy
the
fact
of
my
secret
interview
with
you
this
evening
let
theoph
himself
send
the
so
be
it
you
may
count
on
starting
on
your
expedition
as
planned
good
luck
to
good
luck
to
jud
the
great
and
may
you
win
arkilu
the
so
the
hastened
back
to
his
quarters
where
quivven
on
her
return
found
him
placidly
reclining
on
a
divan
for
a
few
minutes
they
chatted
playfully
together
and
then
she
suddenly
narrowed
her
eyelids
looked
at
him
with
a
peculiar
expression
and
asked
aren
t
you
the
least
bit
anxious
to
know
what
answer
arkilu
made
to
your
note
that
was
so
he
written
arkilu
a
note
but
now
that
it
had
served
its
purpose
he
had
completely
forgotten
about
it
how
could
he
square
himself
with
little
quivven
by
flattery
of
course
i
m
anxious
to
know
he
asserted
but
i
was
so
glad
to
have
you
come
back
again
that
for
the
moment
i
neglected
to
ask
quivven
the
golden
flame
pouted
now
you
re
teasing
me
again
she
said
and
i
won
t
stand
for
but
i
really
want
to
know
he
continued
with
mock
eagerness
please
do
tell
me
about
your
i
gave
her
the
just
then
there
came
a
loud
pounding
on
the
gate
outside
so
loud
in
fact
that
the
sound
penetrated
within
the
house
quivven
stopped
talking
she
and
myles
listened
intently
the
pounding
continued
evidently
we
are
to
have
company
this
evening
he
remarked
glad
to
change
the
subject
quivven
replied
such
a
racket
at
this
time
of
night
can
mean
naught
but
let
us
approach
the
gate
with
care
and
question
the
so
saying
she
took
down
one
of
the
hanging
stone
lamps
and
opened
the
outside
door
it
was
a
typical
dark
silent
fragrant
porovian
evening
except
for
the
fact
that
the
darkness
was
broken
by
the
glare
of
the
torches
beyond
the
wall
and
that
the
silence
was
broken
by
the
pounding
on
the
gate
and
that
the
fragrance
was
marred
by
the
smoke
of
quivven
s
lamp
who
is
there
quivven
called
to
this
there
came
back
the
peremptory
shout
open
quickly
in
the
name
of
theoph
the
grim
the
golden
girl
recoiled
even
cabot
himself
shuddered
as
he
realized
the
evident
cause
of
the
disturbance
his
plot
with
jud
had
produced
results
beyond
what
they
had
planned
and
theoph
upon
seizing
the
note
had
decided
not
merely
to
cancel
the
performance
but
also
to
place
his
daughter
s
supposed
sweetheart
under
arrest
i
am
afraid
your
father
has
intercepted
my
letter
to
your
sister
cabot
explained
i
tell
you
what
leave
by
the
rear
door
make
your
way
quickly
to
arkilu
and
see
if
the
two
of
you
can
intercede
for
me
with
your
stern
so
saying
he
released
her
the
slim
princess
handed
him
the
light
and
sped
into
the
interior
of
the
house
cease
your
noise
he
shouted
for
i
myles
cabot
the
minorian
come
to
unbar
the
gate
in
person
he
strode
down
the
path
quickly
he
slid
the
huge
wooden
bolts
swung
the
gate
open
and
stepped
outside
shielding
the
lamp
with
one
hand
to
get
a
view
of
the
disturbers
but
his
lamp
was
instantly
dashed
from
him
and
his
arms
bound
behind
him
his
captors
were
about
a
dozen
vairking
soldiers
in
leather
tunics
and
helmets
some
carrying
wooden
spears
and
some
holding
torches
while
their
evident
leader
was
similarly
clothed
but
armed
with
a
sharp
wooden
rapier
as
soon
as
the
prisoner
was
securely
bound
the
guard
hustled
him
roughly
off
down
the
street
thus
were
his
plans
rudely
dashed
to
the
ground
on
the
preceding
night
all
had
been
arranged
for
his
trip
to
secure
the
elements
for
the
construction
of
a
radio
set
with
which
to
communicate
with
cupia
and
his
lilla
that
morning
he
had
been
forced
to
postpone
his
trip
in
order
to
perform
before
theoph
the
grim
and
this
evening
he
was
theoph
s
prisoner
slated
ix
a
prisoner
the
squad
of
vairking
soldiers
with
myles
cabot
as
their
prisoner
had
traversed
nowhere
near
the
distance
to
the
palace
when
they
turned
from
the
street
through
a
gate
where
are
they
going
to
take
me
now
myles
wondered
this
question
was
soon
answered
for
the
party
entered
a
building
which
was
evidently
a
dwelling
of
the
better
class
the
hall
was
well
lighted
so
that
miles
blinked
at
the
sudden
glare
the
leader
of
the
party
placed
himself
squarely
in
front
of
his
prisoner
with
hands
on
his
hips
and
remarked
with
apparent
irrelevance
well
we
fooled
quivven
didn
t
we
the
prisoner
stared
at
him
in
surprise
it
was
jud
jud
disguised
as
a
common
soldier
cabot
laughed
with
relief
you
certainly
gave
me
a
bad
part
of
a
day
he
asserted
i
didn
t
recognize
you
in
your
street
clothes
what
is
the
great
idea
the
great
idea
the
noble
replied
to
quote
your
phrase
is
that
i
did
truly
represent
theoph
the
grim
he
authorized
me
to
arrest
you
in
his
name
the
pretty
little
spy
will
report
your
capture
to
arkilu
and
her
father
will
stonily
refuse
to
reveal
where
you
are
imprisoned
meanwhile
i
shall
give
the
golden
one
time
to
escape
and
shall
then
send
a
second
squad
to
seize
your
effects
your
expedition
will
start
immediately
come
unbind
the
as
soon
as
his
bonds
were
loosed
myles
warmly
grasped
the
hand
of
his
benefactor
you
are
all
right
he
exclaimed
you
have
completely
succeeded
without
leaving
anything
to
i
succeed
and
never
have
to
explain
anything
jud
replied
a
bit
coldly
and
so
late
that
night
the
radio
man
dressed
in
leather
tunic
and
helmet
and
armed
with
a
tempered
wood
rapier
set
out
with
his
bodyguard
for
the
western
mountains
in
silence
and
with
the
minimum
of
lights
they
threaded
the
streets
of
jud
s
compound
and
then
the
streets
of
the
city
until
they
came
to
the
west
gate
where
a
pass
signed
by
theoph
the
grim
gave
them
free
exit
thence
they
moved
due
westward
across
the
plain
with
scouts
thrown
out
to
guard
against
contact
with
any
roving
roies
by
daybreak
they
had
reached
the
cover
of
the
wooded
foothills
and
there
they
camped
for
a
full
day
of
much
needed
rest
finally
on
the
second
morning
following
their
stealthy
departure
from
vairkingi
their
journey
really
started
the
commander
of
the
bodyguard
was
an
intelligent
youth
named
crota
during
the
meals
at
the
first
encampment
myles
described
to
crota
in
considerable
detail
the
particular
form
of
copper
pyrites
which
furnish
the
bulk
of
the
copper
used
for
electrical
purposes
on
the
continent
of
cupia
after
listening
intently
to
this
description
for
about
the
fifth
time
crota
smiled
and
said
we
vairkings
place
no
stock
in
pretty
stones
except
as
playthings
for
our
children
but
i
do
recall
the
little
golden
cubes
with
which
the
children
of
one
of
the
hill
villages
are
accustomed
to
play
this
village
sur
by
name
is
only
a
day
s
journey
to
the
southward
let
us
turn
our
steps
thither
and
learn
from
the
children
where
they
get
their
out
of
the
mouths
of
babes
and
sucklings
the
quoted
to
himself
and
so
they
set
out
to
the
southward
following
a
trail
which
wound
in
and
out
between
the
fertile
hills
which
were
for
the
most
part
scantily
wooded
toward
the
close
of
the
day
crota
s
scouts
established
contact
with
the
outposts
of
the
village
which
they
were
seeking
and
after
an
exchange
of
communications
by
runner
the
expedition
was
given
free
passage
to
proceed
shortly
thereafter
they
came
in
sight
of
the
village
itself
from
among
the
surrounding
verdant
rolling
terrain
there
arose
one
rocky
eminence
with
precipitous
sides
and
with
a
flat
summit
on
which
stood
the
village
of
sur
surrounded
by
a
strong
wooden
palisade
up
the
face
of
the
cliff
there
ran
a
narrow
zigzag
path
cut
in
the
living
rock
and
overhung
by
many
a
bastion
from
which
huge
stones
could
be
tumbled
or
molten
pitch
poured
on
any
invaders
so
rash
as
to
attempt
the
ascent
along
this
path
the
expedition
crawled
in
single
file
with
many
pauses
to
draw
their
breath
and
before
they
reached
the
summit
cabot
realized
full
well
how
it
was
that
sur
the
southernmost
outpost
of
vairkingian
civilization
had
so
long
and
so
successfully
withstood
the
onslaughts
of
the
wild
and
savage
roies
the
inhabitants
furry
vairkings
turned
out
in
large
numbers
to
greet
the
visitors
and
especially
to
inspect
the
furless
body
and
the
much
overfurred
chin
of
the
guides
led
the
expedition
to
a
large
public
hall
where
after
a
speech
of
welcome
by
the
headman
of
the
village
they
were
fed
and
quartered
for
the
night
between
the
meal
and
bedtime
the
visiting
soldiers
strolled
out
to
see
the
sights
by
the
pale
pink
light
of
the
unseen
setting
sun
cabot
and
crota
together
walked
to
the
west
wall
to
observe
the
sunset
as
the
two
of
them
leaned
on
the
parapet
a
rattling
noise
on
the
rocky
walk
beside
them
disturbed
their
reverie
looking
down
they
saw
three
furry
children
rolling
some
small
objects
along
the
ground
with
a
slight
exclamation
of
surprise
and
pleasure
the
vairking
soldier
swooped
down
upon
the
youngsters
scooped
up
one
of
the
toys
and
handed
it
to
the
crota
laconically
announced
and
sure
enough
it
was
one
of
the
small
which
he
had
described
to
his
companion
but
before
the
latter
had
had
the
slightest
opportunity
to
examine
it
the
bespoiled
infant
let
out
a
howl
of
childish
rage
and
commenced
to
assail
myles
with
fists
and
teeth
and
feet
stop
that
crota
shouted
grabbing
him
by
one
arm
and
pulling
him
away
we
don
t
want
to
keep
your
we
merely
want
to
look
at
it
this
gentleman
has
never
seen
a
gentleman
the
boy
replied
from
a
safe
distance
common
soldier
bah
but
myles
cabot
was
too
engrossed
to
notice
the
insult
the
small
cube
in
his
hand
was
undoubtedly
a
metallic
crystal
but
whether
chalcopyrite
or
not
he
could
not
tell
in
the
fading
light
in
fact
it
might
be
the
sunset
which
gave
the
stone
its
coppery
tinge
taking
a
small
flint
knife
from
a
leather
sheath
that
hung
from
his
belt
myles
offered
it
to
the
child
in
exchange
for
the
toy
in
spite
of
crota
s
gasping
protest
at
the
extravagance
the
boy
eagerly
accepted
the
offer
remarking
thank
you
sir
you
should
take
off
those
it
was
a
very
neat
and
subtle
compliment
gentlemen
vairkings
never
wore
clothes
cabot
was
impressed
your
name
my
son
he
asked
patting
the
furry
little
creature
on
the
head
tomo
the
brief
was
the
reply
i
shall
remember
then
he
hurried
back
to
the
public
hall
eager
to
examine
his
purchase
by
the
light
of
the
oil
flares
sure
enough
it
turned
out
to
be
really
pyrites
and
by
its
deep
color
probably
a
pyrites
rich
in
copper
to
the
radio
man
it
meant
the
first
tangible
step
toward
the
accomplishment
of
the
greatest
radio
feat
ever
undertaken
on
two
worlds
namely
the
construction
of
a
complete
sending
and
receiving
set
out
of
nothing
but
basic
materials
in
their
natural
state
without
the
aid
of
a
single
previously
fabricated
tool
utensil
or
chemical
to
this
day
myles
wears
this
cube
as
a
pendant
charm
in
commemoration
of
that
momentous
occasion
as
he
lay
on
the
floor
of
the
public
building
that
night
the
reviewed
the
events
of
the
day
until
he
came
to
the
episode
of
the
purchase
of
the
cubical
pyrite
crystal
from
little
tomo
your
name
my
son
cabot
had
asked
him
my
son
thought
cabot
i
have
a
son
of
my
own
across
the
boiling
seas
on
the
continent
of
cupia
and
a
wife
the
most
beautiful
and
sweetest
lady
in
poros
they
are
in
dire
danger
or
were
many
months
ago
when
i
received
the
s
o
s
which
led
me
to
return
through
the
skies
to
this
planet
oh
how
i
wish
that
i
could
learn
what
that
danger
was
and
what
has
happened
to
them
since
then
thus
he
mused
and
yet
when
he
came
to
figure
up
the
time
since
his
capture
he
was
able
to
account
for
less
than
three
weeks
of
earth
time
perhaps
there
was
still
a
chance
of
rescue
if
he
would
but
hurry
the
danger
which
had
inspired
his
lilla
s
call
for
help
was
undoubtedly
due
to
the
return
of
prince
yuri
across
the
boiling
seas
for
all
that
myles
knew
princess
lilla
and
the
loyal
cupians
were
still
holding
out
against
their
renegade
prince
the
message
which
cabot
had
ticked
out
into
the
ether
from
the
radio
station
of
the
ants
had
been
sent
only
a
few
days
after
the
s
o
if
received
by
lilla
or
any
of
her
friends
it
had
undoubtedly
served
to
encourage
them
to
stiffen
their
resistance
to
the
usurper
and
if
received
by
yuri
it
had
undoubtedly
thrown
into
him
the
fear
of
the
great
builder
musing
and
hoping
thus
the
fell
into
a
troubled
sleep
through
which
there
swirled
a
tangled
phantasmagoria
of
cupians
whistling
bees
and
vairkings
with
occasional
glimpses
of
a
little
blond
head
sometimes
surmounted
by
golden
curls
and
two
dainty
antennae
but
sometimes
completely
covered
with
golden
fur
shortly
after
sunrise
he
awoke
and
aroused
crota
no
time
must
be
lost
the
princess
lilla
must
be
saved
but
there
was
nothing
they
could
do
until
their
hosts
brought
the
food
for
the
morning
meal
from
the
bearers
they
now
ascertained
that
the
cubes
were
gathered
in
a
cleft
in
the
rocks
only
a
short
distance
from
the
village
and
that
although
the
perfect
cubes
were
rare
and
quite
highly
prized
the
imperfect
specimens
were
present
in
great
quantities
in
fact
hundreds
of
cartloads
had
been
mined
and
picked
over
in
search
of
perfect
cubes
and
thus
all
this
ore
would
be
available
in
return
for
the
mere
trouble
of
shoveling
it
into
carts
as
soon
as
arrangements
could
be
made
with
the
headman
of
sur
cabot
and
his
party
accompanied
by
guides
crept
down
the
narrow
zigzag
path
to
the
plain
below
the
village
and
proceeded
up
a
ravine
to
the
quarry
where
they
verified
all
that
had
been
told
them
it
was
a
beautiful
sight
a
rocky
wall
out
of
a
cleft
in
which
there
seemed
to
pour
a
waterfall
of
gold
but
on
close
inspection
every
cube
was
seen
to
be
nicked
or
bent
or
out
of
proportion
or
jammed
part
way
through
or
into
some
other
cube
the
soldiers
both
those
from
vairkingi
and
those
from
sur
scrambled
up
the
golden
cascade
and
started
hacking
the
crystals
out
of
the
solid
formation
in
search
for
perfect
cubes
while
their
two
leaders
watched
them
with
amusement
from
below
all
at
once
there
came
a
shriek
and
one
of
the
vairkings
toppled
the
whole
length
of
the
pile
almost
at
cabot
s
feet
where
he
lay
perfectly
still
the
wooden
shaft
of
an
arrow
projecting
from
one
eyeball
roies
crota
shouted
instantly
every
member
of
the
party
took
cover
with
military
precision
behind
some
rock
or
tree
they
had
not
long
to
wait
for
a
shower
of
missiles
from
up
the
valley
soon
apprised
them
of
the
location
of
the
enemy
so
the
vairkings
thereafter
remained
alert
those
who
had
bows
drew
them
and
discharged
a
arrow
at
every
stir
of
grass
or
bush
in
the
locality
whence
the
missiles
of
the
enemy
had
come
we
know
not
their
number
crota
whispered
to
cabot
and
since
we
have
accomplished
our
mission
let
us
return
to
sur
as
speedily
as
agreed
the
replied
the
withdrawal
was
accomplished
as
follows
crota
first
dispatched
runners
to
the
village
to
inform
the
inhabitants
of
the
situation
then
leaving
a
small
rear
guard
of
archers
and
slingers
to
cover
their
retreat
he
formed
the
remainder
of
the
expedition
in
open
order
and
set
out
for
sur
as
rapidly
as
the
cover
would
permit
the
enemy
kept
pretty
well
hidden
but
it
was
evident
from
the
increase
of
arrows
and
pebbles
that
their
numbers
were
steadily
augmenting
noting
this
crota
sent
another
runner
ahead
with
this
information
it
now
became
necessary
to
replenish
and
relieve
the
rear
guard
of
which
several
were
dead
several
more
wounded
and
the
rest
tired
and
out
of
ammunition
this
done
crota
ordered
the
main
body
of
his
force
to
leave
cover
and
take
up
the
double
quick
the
result
was
unexpected
a
hundred
or
more
roies
charged
yelling
down
the
ravine
through
the
vairking
rear
guard
and
straight
at
cabot
s
men
who
at
once
ran
to
cover
again
and
took
deadly
toll
of
the
oncoming
enemy
but
the
roies
so
greatly
outnumbered
the
vairkings
that
the
tide
could
not
be
stemmed
and
soon
the
two
groups
were
mingled
together
in
a
seething
mass
the
first
rush
was
met
spear
on
spear
then
the
sharp
wooden
swords
were
drawn
and
cabot
found
himself
lunging
and
parrying
against
three
naked
furry
warriors
the
neck
was
the
vulnerable
spot
of
the
vairkings
and
it
was
this
point
which
the
roies
strove
to
reach
as
cabot
soon
noted
that
simplified
matters
for
guarding
one
s
neck
against
such
crude
swordsmen
as
these
furry
aborigines
was
easy
for
a
skilled
fencer
such
as
he
accordingly
one
by
one
he
ran
three
antagonists
through
the
body
just
as
he
was
withdrawing
his
blade
from
his
last
victim
he
noted
that
crota
was
being
hard
pressed
by
a
burly
roy
swordsman
so
he
hastened
to
his
friend
s
assistance
and
he
was
just
in
time
for
even
as
cabot
approached
the
naked
roy
knocked
the
vairking
s
weapon
from
his
hand
with
a
particularly
dexterous
sideswipe
and
thus
had
crota
at
his
mercy
but
before
the
naked
one
could
follow
up
his
advantage
the
hurled
his
own
sword
like
a
spear
and
down
went
the
roy
impaled
through
the
back
carrying
crota
with
him
as
he
fell
cabot
paused
to
draw
breath
and
was
just
viewing
with
satisfaction
the
lucky
results
of
his
chance
throw
when
a
peremptory
command
of
yield
behind
him
caused
him
to
wheel
about
and
confront
a
new
enemy
the
author
of
the
shout
was
a
massive
furry
warrior
with
a
placid
almost
bovine
face
which
nevertheless
betokened
considerable
intellect
and
to
whom
would
i
yield
if
i
did
yield
myles
asked
facing
unarmed
the
poised
sword
of
his
new
enemy
grod
the
silent
king
of
the
roies
was
the
dignified
reply
i
thought
that
att
the
terrible
was
king
of
your
people
the
returned
sparring
for
time
that
is
what
att
thinks
too
the
other
answered
with
a
slight
smile
but
the
smile
was
for
myles
cabot
having
momentarily
distracted
his
opponent
s
attention
by
this
conversation
stepped
suddenly
under
the
guard
of
the
furry
grod
and
planted
his
fist
square
on
grod
s
fat
chin
down
crashed
the
king
his
sword
clattering
from
his
nerveless
hand
in
an
instant
myles
snatched
up
the
blade
and
bestrode
his
prostrate
foe
just
as
he
was
about
to
plunge
its
point
into
grod
s
vitals
there
occurred
to
him
the
proverb
of
poblath
while
enemies
dispute
the
realm
is
at
with
grod
the
silent
and
att
the
terrible
both
contending
for
the
leadership
of
the
roies
vairkingia
might
enjoy
a
respite
from
the
depredations
of
this
wild
and
lawless
race
he
would
leave
the
fallen
roy
for
dead
rather
than
put
him
actually
in
that
condition
accordingly
he
sprang
to
the
aid
of
his
companions
crota
was
already
back
in
the
fray
his
own
sword
in
his
hands
once
more
and
the
sword
of
his
late
burly
opponent
slung
at
his
side
quite
evidently
he
did
not
intend
to
be
disarmed
again
three
vairking
common
soldiers
and
crota
and
myles
now
confronted
seven
roies
this
constituted
a
fairly
even
match
for
the
superior
intelligence
and
the
leather
armor
of
the
men
of
vairkingi
and
sur
offset
the
greater
numbers
of
their
aboriginal
antagonists
what
the
outcome
would
have
been
can
never
be
known
for
at
that
moment
the
reinforcements
from
the
village
came
charging
up
the
ravine
and
at
the
same
instant
the
tops
of
the
cliffs
were
lined
with
roies
who
sent
a
shower
of
arrows
upon
those
below
the
contending
twelve
immediately
separated
cabot
and
his
followers
passed
within
the
protection
of
his
rescuers
and
the
return
to
sur
was
renewed
the
commander
of
the
rescue
party
threw
out
a
strong
rear
guard
and
the
vairking
archers
on
both
flanks
peppered
the
cliff
tops
with
sling
shots
and
arrows
but
the
marauding
roies
harassed
every
step
of
the
retreat
there
was
some
respite
when
cabot
s
party
reached
the
plain
where
stood
the
rocky
peak
with
the
village
of
sur
on
its
summit
for
arrows
could
not
carry
from
the
cover
of
the
surrounding
woods
to
the
foot
of
the
rocks
but
as
the
tired
party
began
the
ascent
of
the
narrow
path
on
the
face
of
the
cliff
they
noted
that
the
roies
were
forming
solid
banks
of
wooden
shields
and
were
advancing
across
the
plain
arrows
now
began
to
fly
from
below
at
the
ascending
vairking
party
several
of
whom
toppled
and
fell
down
the
face
of
the
cliff
and
then
the
warrior
just
above
myles
on
the
narrow
path
clutched
his
breast
with
a
gasp
and
dropped
square
upon
the
who
braced
himself
and
caught
the
body
thus
preventing
it
from
being
dashed
to
pieces
at
the
foot
of
the
rocks
whether
or
not
the
furry
soldier
was
dead
could
not
be
ascertained
until
myles
should
have
reached
the
summit
so
up
he
toiled
with
his
burden
until
he
gained
the
protection
of
the
palisade
where
he
laid
the
vairking
gently
on
the
ground
and
tore
open
his
leather
tunic
to
see
if
any
life
were
present
the
wounded
man
still
breathed
though
hoarsely
and
his
heart
still
beat
but
there
was
a
gaping
hole
in
one
side
of
his
chest
no
arrow
protruding
from
this
hole
myles
tenderly
turned
the
man
over
to
see
if
the
wound
extended
clear
through
it
and
from
the
man
s
side
there
projected
the
tip
of
a
bullet
the
tip
of
a
leaden
rifle
bullet
x
the
siege
of
sur
myles
quickly
extracted
the
bullet
from
the
back
of
the
wounded
vairking
then
tender
furry
female
hands
bore
the
victim
away
as
the
stood
in
thoughtful
contemplation
of
his
find
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
it
this
was
a
bullet
identical
with
those
used
in
the
rifles
of
the
how
came
such
a
weapon
in
the
hands
of
the
savage
and
untrained
roies
it
was
inconceivable
that
these
uncultured
brutes
had
overwhelmed
new
formia
and
captured
the
weapons
of
the
no
the
only
possible
explanation
was
that
the
formians
had
formed
an
alliance
with
the
roies
and
were
either
fighting
beside
them
or
at
least
had
furnished
them
with
a
few
firearms
the
use
of
which
they
had
taught
them
but
this
last
idea
was
improbable
due
to
the
shortage
of
rifles
and
ammunition
at
yuriana
capital
of
the
new
ant
empire
no
if
the
were
in
alliance
with
these
furry
savages
there
must
be
present
with
the
besiegers
and
the
shot
in
question
must
have
been
fired
by
the
claw
of
a
formian
this
opened
up
new
terrors
for
the
village
of
sur
and
its
inhabitants
myles
glanced
apprehensively
at
the
southern
sky
half
expecting
to
see
and
hear
the
approach
of
a
formian
plane
but
the
radiant
silver
expanse
was
unmarred
by
any
black
speck
sur
was
safe
for
the
moment
his
musings
thus
completed
myles
hurried
to
the
public
hall
to
communicate
this
discovery
to
crota
and
the
village
authorities
he
found
the
headman
already
there
in
conference
with
crota
said
myles
exhibiting
the
bullet
here
is
one
of
the
magic
stones
thrown
by
one
of
my
own
magic
which
is
capable
of
shooting
from
the
ground
to
the
top
of
your
cliffs
and
even
penetrating
your
palisade
it
is
big
magic
with
its
aid
the
roies
can
overcome
us
without
it
i
am
powerless
therefore
we
must
secure
possession
of
it
what
do
you
suggest
crota
replied
it
is
now
sunset
let
us
select
a
squad
of
picked
scouts
and
try
to
stalk
the
camp
of
the
no
no
the
headman
of
sur
exclaimed
in
horror
never
have
our
men
dared
to
attack
the
roies
by
do
the
roies
know
this
myles
asked
with
interest
most
certainly
was
the
reply
then
he
said
all
the
more
reason
for
attempting
it
they
will
be
the
magistrate
shrugged
his
furry
shoulders
with
if
you
can
persuade
any
men
of
sur
to
attempt
anything
so
foolhardy
i
shall
interpose
no
within
a
twelfth
of
a
day
crota
had
enrolled
twenty
scouts
and
with
myles
cabot
they
had
all
begun
the
stealthy
descent
of
the
narrow
winding
path
down
the
face
of
the
cliff
before
starting
they
had
observed
the
direction
of
the
roy
on
one
of
the
surrounding
hills
so
now
they
crept
quietly
toward
that
hill
and
then
slowly
up
to
its
crest
in
spite
of
the
dense
blackness
of
the
porovian
night
they
were
able
to
find
their
way
first
by
starting
in
the
correct
direction
and
then
by
keeping
the
lights
of
their
own
village
always
behind
them
as
cabot
had
expected
from
the
remarks
of
the
headman
there
were
no
sentinels
on
post
for
the
enemy
were
quite
evidently
relying
on
the
vairking
fear
of
the
unknown
terrors
of
the
dark
indeed
it
spoke
volumes
for
the
individual
courage
of
the
members
of
this
venture
and
for
their
confidence
in
their
leader
that
they
had
dared
to
come
finally
the
party
emerged
from
the
underbrush
at
the
top
of
the
hill
a
few
score
of
feet
from
the
tents
and
of
the
roies
there
motioning
the
others
to
remain
where
they
were
until
he
gave
a
signal
myles
crawled
forward
always
keeping
in
the
shadow
of
some
tent
until
he
was
able
to
peek
through
a
small
bush
beside
one
of
the
tents
directly
at
the
group
around
one
of
the
just
as
cabot
arrived
at
this
observation
post
a
roy
warrior
was
declaiming
i
told
you
it
would
work
for
had
i
not
seen
it
demonstrated
fully
to
me
you
yourselves
saw
it
kill
now
will
you
not
believe
me
another
spoke
i
can
not
understand
its
principle
how
can
a
weapon
kill
afar
and
yet
not
resemble
either
a
sling
or
a
bow
and
another
show
us
how
it
works
friend
then
perhaps
we
may
be
and
a
third
i
do
not
believe
that
he
has
whereat
the
original
speaker
nettled
spoke
again
it
is
in
my
tent
there
you
doubters
indicating
the
one
beside
which
cabot
crouched
quick
as
a
flash
cabot
wriggled
beneath
the
back
of
the
tent
into
its
interior
the
campfire
light
penetrating
through
the
slit
opening
in
front
revealed
nothing
but
rumpled
blankets
on
the
floor
and
ordinary
weapons
slung
to
the
tent
pole
so
the
intruder
commenced
rummaging
among
the
bedding
the
conversation
outside
continued
prove
or
be
silent
said
a
voice
you
saw
the
vairking
fall
did
you
not
the
original
speaker
replied
true
but
i
did
not
see
you
sling
any
meanwhile
cabot
continued
his
frantic
search
at
last
it
was
rewarded
in
one
corner
of
the
tent
his
groping
fingers
closed
upon
a
formian
rifle
and
a
bandolier
of
cartridges
a
thrill
ran
through
him
at
the
touch
to
prove
it
to
you
the
voice
outside
was
saying
angrily
i
will
get
it
for
you
and
if
you
do
not
believe
me
i
shall
slingshot
you
with
it
ought
to
be
proof
enough
even
for
a
stupid
one
like
you
i
have
said
it
the
signal
for
my
exit
myles
said
to
himself
as
he
hastened
to
crawl
out
through
the
back
of
the
tent
but
then
he
reflected
no
i
want
more
than
this
gun
and
ammunition
i
want
so
he
remained
as
the
roy
entered
the
tent
and
felt
for
the
rifle
the
crouching
flung
himself
upon
him
and
before
the
startled
furry
one
could
utter
even
a
gasp
strong
fingers
closed
upon
his
windpipe
throttling
off
all
sound
the
struggle
was
over
in
a
few
moments
when
myles
cabot
finally
crept
out
of
the
enemy
tent
it
was
with
a
limp
form
under
one
arm
and
a
bandolier
and
a
rifle
slung
across
his
shoulders
the
conversation
at
the
camp
fire
continued
one
of
the
warriors
was
saying
our
friend
takes
long
to
find
his
wonderful
methinks
he
was
lying
and
does
not
dare
to
face
said
another
voice
let
us
pull
him
from
his
tent
and
confront
him
with
his
at
this
myles
sprang
to
his
feet
and
ran
to
the
cover
which
concealed
his
followers
rush
in
among
them
as
we
planned
he
urged
while
you
two
come
with
then
on
he
sped
down
the
hillside
towards
the
lights
of
sur
with
his
captive
and
trophies
and
two
members
of
the
band
while
crota
and
the
remaining
eighteen
charged
yelling
into
the
midst
of
the
roy
camp
upsetting
tents
scattering
camp
fires
and
laying
about
them
with
their
swords
straight
through
the
camp
they
charged
shouting
make
way
for
att
the
terrible
then
they
circled
the
hill
under
cover
of
the
darkness
and
rejoined
myles
the
startled
roies
were
taken
completely
by
surprise
from
the
cries
of
crota
and
his
followers
they
assumed
that
the
intruders
were
roies
partisans
of
att
the
terrible
attacking
them
for
being
partisans
of
grod
the
silent
as
they
came
rushing
out
of
their
standing
tents
or
crawled
from
beneath
such
tents
as
had
been
wrecked
they
met
others
of
their
own
camp
similarly
rushing
or
crawling
and
mistaking
them
for
enemies
started
to
fight
the
confusion
was
complete
and
never
for
a
moment
did
the
naked
furry
savages
suspect
that
the
whole
trouble
had
been
caused
by
a
mere
handful
of
vairkings
truly
as
poblath
the
philosopher
has
said
while
enemies
dispute
the
realm
is
at
while
the
roy
followers
of
grod
the
silent
fought
among
themselves
until
they
gradually
discovered
that
there
was
no
one
there
except
themselves
myles
cabot
and
his
vairkings
safely
regained
the
village
of
sur
with
the
rifle
the
ammunition
and
the
still
unconscious
roy
warrior
in
the
public
hall
under
the
tender
ministrations
of
vairking
would
far
rather
have
plunged
a
flint
knife
into
captive
finally
regained
his
senses
and
looked
around
him
in
bewilderment
where
am
i
he
asked
rubbing
his
eyes
in
sur
some
one
replied
then
are
we
victorious
for
never
before
has
a
roy
set
foot
in
no
your
forces
are
not
victorious
crota
answered
you
are
a
prisoner
and
it
is
only
by
the
grace
of
cabot
the
minorian
that
you
are
permitted
to
come
here
even
as
a
prisoner
for
the
men
of
sur
take
no
prisoners
and
give
no
in
reply
myles
himself
stepped
forward
i
myself
am
cabot
the
minorian
he
said
to
which
crota
added
impressively
the
greatest
magician
of
two
worlds
the
prisoner
shook
his
head
i
know
of
only
one
world
he
asserted
and
this
man
before
me
is
dressed
as
a
mere
common
soldier
as
are
all
of
know
then
o
scum
of
poros
the
admonished
that
there
are
other
worlds
beyond
the
silver
skies
and
that
in
the
world
from
which
i
come
all
soldiers
are
but
the
roy
warrior
was
not
to
be
subdued
by
language
how
did
i
come
here
he
asked
you
did
not
come
here
myles
answered
you
were
brought
i
brought
but
how
by
what
magic
my
magic
cart
which
swims
through
the
air
as
a
reptile
swims
through
the
waters
of
a
true
the
roy
mused
there
be
such
aerial
wagons
for
i
have
seen
them
near
the
city
of
the
beasts
of
the
mark
well
myles
interjected
to
the
assembled
vairkings
then
to
the
prisoner
again
i
captured
you
because
you
possessed
the
magic
and
presumed
to
use
it
on
one
of
my
own
men
this
effrontery
could
not
be
permitted
to
go
unpunished
hence
your
capture
the
offending
weapon
is
now
mine
and
you
are
my
what
do
you
propose
to
do
with
me
the
captive
asked
i
propose
to
ask
you
some
questions
myles
evaded
first
where
did
you
get
the
magic
the
great
magician
knows
everything
the
roy
replied
with
a
sneer
why
then
should
i
presume
to
tell
him
anything
but
the
remained
unruffled
you
are
correct
he
countered
i
ask
not
because
i
do
not
already
know
but
because
i
wish
to
test
whether
it
is
possible
for
one
of
your
degraded
race
to
tell
the
why
test
that
came
back
the
brazen
roy
for
doubtless
you
who
know
everything
know
that
myles
could
not
help
admiring
the
insulting
calm
with
which
this
furry
man
of
inferior
race
confronted
his
relentless
captors
who
are
you
rash
one
he
asked
the
prisoner
drew
himself
up
proudly
with
folded
arms
and
answered
i
am
otto
the
bold
son
of
grod
the
ah
myles
said
the
son
of
a
king
and
i
am
the
father
of
a
king
well
then
as
one
man
to
another
tell
me
where
you
got
this
gun
otto
queried
is
that
the
name
of
this
weapon
of
bad
omen
know
then
that
i
got
it
from
you
yourself
when
i
wounded
you
beneath
the
tree
beside
the
brook
at
the
foot
of
the
mountains
before
the
vairkings
of
jud
the
drove
me
off
i
have
spoken
and
spoken
truly
cabot
replied
concealing
his
surprise
with
difficulty
of
course
why
had
he
not
guessed
it
before
but
there
were
still
some
more
points
to
clear
up
so
he
continued
why
did
you
shoot
those
two
arrows
at
me
in
the
house
at
the
top
of
the
mountains
because
we
wished
to
explore
the
house
but
you
killed
my
companion
whereupon
i
resolved
to
kill
you
in
revenge
and
to
capture
the
noisy
gun
is
that
the
right
word
so
i
trailed
you
the
rest
you
remember
i
know
myles
said
grinning
but
did
you
ever
see
any
one
but
me
shoot
the
gun
you
know
i
never
did
was
the
reply
no
one
on
poros
save
cabot
the
magician
and
otto
the
bold
has
ever
done
this
big
magic
i
saw
the
results
but
not
the
means
when
you
killed
my
companion
so
i
experimented
for
myself
after
i
had
stolen
your
gun
and
soon
i
learned
how
after
which
i
carefully
conserved
the
magic
stones
until
last
night
when
i
shot
one
of
the
vairkings
of
sur
so
as
to
give
visible
proof
of
my
magic
powers
to
my
doubting
the
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
there
existed
as
yet
no
alliance
between
the
formians
and
the
roies
pray
heaven
that
such
a
calamity
would
never
suggest
itself
to
the
minds
of
either
race
for
if
so
then
woe
to
vairkingia
son
of
a
king
he
said
return
to
your
people
and
your
father
give
him
my
greetings
and
tell
them
that
you
are
the
friend
of
a
great
magician
who
lent
you
his
gun
who
transported
you
through
the
air
within
the
walls
of
sur
where
no
roy
has
ever
stood
or
will
ever
stand
and
who
last
night
caused
phantom
warriors
to
attack
your
camp
under
the
guise
of
followers
of
att
the
terrible
go
now
my
men
will
give
you
safe
conduct
to
the
plain
and
what
is
the
price
of
this
freedom
otto
disdainfully
inquired
the
friendship
of
a
king
s
father
for
a
king
s
son
myles
cabot
replied
with
dignity
the
two
drew
themselves
up
proudly
and
regarded
each
other
for
a
moment
it
is
well
otto
the
bold
declared
and
he
departed
under
the
escort
of
a
vairking
guard
the
master
knows
best
crota
remarked
sadly
shaking
his
head
but
i
should
have
run
the
wretch
through
the
the
next
morning
cabot
thanked
the
headman
of
sur
for
his
hospitality
and
took
up
the
return
trail
for
vairkingi
the
vacancies
in
his
ranks
being
filled
by
the
loan
of
soldiers
from
sur
the
party
had
gone
but
a
short
distance
when
they
found
the
way
barred
by
a
formidable
body
of
roies
but
before
these
came
within
a
bullet
from
cabot
s
rifle
brought
two
of
them
to
the
ground
whereupon
the
rest
turned
and
fled
precipitately
later
in
the
day
a
bend
in
the
road
brought
them
suddenly
upon
a
furry
warrior
myles
fired
and
the
man
instantly
fell
to
the
ground
but
when
they
reached
the
body
there
was
not
even
a
scratch
to
be
found
on
it
the
bullet
had
missed
dead
of
fright
myles
thought
but
no
for
the
heart
was
still
beating
although
faintly
and
the
lungs
were
still
functioning
sit
up
there
myles
ordered
can
t
the
roy
replied
i
m
then
i
ll
make
you
alive
again
his
captor
declared
placing
his
hands
on
the
head
of
the
roy
cadabra
thereat
the
soldier
sat
up
with
a
sigh
of
relief
and
opened
his
eyes
stand
up
myles
ordered
for
reply
the
roy
jumped
to
his
feet
and
started
running
for
cover

the
commanded
halt
or
i

kill
you
again
the

the
man
returned
like
a
sleep
walker
what
do
you
mean
by
running
away
now
listen
intently
are
you
one
of
the
men
of
grod
then
go
to
otto
the
son
of
grod
and
tell
him
that
it
is
the
order
of
cabot
the
magician
that
vairking
expeditions
into
these
mountains
in
search
of
golden
cubes
and
other
minerals
be
unmolested
tell
otto
that

can
recognize

expedition
by
the
blue
flags
which
they
will
carry
hereafter
now
go
i
have
the
roy
warrior
ran
up
the
trail
and
this
time
was
not
halted
another
mistake
crota
remarked
half
to
himself
the
rest
of
the
return
to
vairkingi
was
without
event
on
the
way
the
radio
man
made
notes
of
the
best
deposits
of
quartz
limestone
and
fluorspar
also
he
carried
with
him
a
few
large
sheets
of
mica
but
he
found
no
traces
of
galena
zinc
ore
or
platinum
these
would
require
at
least
one
further
expedition
crota
spared
no
extravagant
language
in
relating
to
jud
the
exploits
of
cabot
the
minorian
in
raising
the
siege
of
the
village
of
sur
and
jud
repeated
the
story
with
embellishments
to
theoph
the
grim
also
the
long
deferred
performance
was
held
at
the
palace
to
the
great
mystification
of
the
king
arkilu
did
not
show
up
to
mar
the
occasion
in
fact
little
quivven
reported
that
her
sister
was
very
indignant
at
the
for
trifling
with
her
affections
and
had
turned
to
jud
in
her
pique
needless
to
say
jud
had
taken
every
possible
advantage
of
cabot
s
absence
to
reinstate
himself
with
the
princess
but
neither
myles
nor
quivven
appeared
to
exhibit
any
very
great
sorrow
at
this
turn
of
affairs
so
long
as
arkilu
s
hostility
did
not
become
active
the
support
of
jud
and
theoph
ought
to
prove
quite
sufficient
the
standing
of
cabot
the
minorian
as
a
magician
was
now
well
established
and
accordingly
jud
the
and
even
theoph
the
grim
were
willing
to
accord
him
all
possible
assistance
in
the
gathering
of
the
materials
with
which
he
was
to
perform
his
further
magic
namely
radio
theoph
made
a
levy
upon
all
the
nobles
and
turned
over
to
the
upward
of
five
hundred
soldiers
with
their
proper
carts
and
equipment
jud
himself
quivven
still
unknown
to
her
father
and
crota
the
soldier
who
had
demonstrated
on
the
expedition
an
intelligence
far
above
his
social
class
were
enrolled
as
laboratory
assistants
several
inclosures
adjoining
cabot
s
yard
were
vacated
and
converted
into
factories
in
one
of
which
were
mounted
a
pair
of
huge
millstones
such
as
the
vairkings
use
in
grinding
certain
of
their
food
myles
divided
his
men
roughly
into
three
groups
one
group
under
crota
he
established
at
the
clay
deposits
to
the
northeast
of
the
city
to
make
bricks
and
charcoal
the
second
group
under
jud
were
engaged
in
the
mining
operations
digging
copper
ore
quartz
rock
fluorspar
limestone
and
sand
at
various
points
in
the
mountains
and
carting
some
of
the
limestone
to
the
brickyard
and
the
rest
with
the
other
products
to
vairkingi
the
carters
carried
back
with
them
to
the
mountains
all
the
necessary
supplies
for
the
expeditions
the
third
group
under
quivven
were
engaged
in
setting
up
the
grist
mill
and
in
other
building
and
preparatory
operations
at
the
claypits
the
first
operation
was
to
scrape
off
the
surface
clay
and
spread
it
out
thin
in
the
open
air
so
it
would
age
fast
the
limestone
upon
its
arrival
at
the
brickyard
was
burned
in
raw
brick
ovens
and
then
carted
to
vairkingi
to
be
ground
at
the
mill
it
was
then
shipped
back
to
the
brick
plant
where
it
was
mixed
with
the
aged
into
bricks
baked
burned
and
carted
to
vairkingi
to
be
ground
into
cement
some
of
the
ground
limestone
was
retained
at
vairkingi
for
use
in
later
and
some
of
the
unground
for
smelting
purposes
other
aged
clay
was
screened
moistened
molded
and
baked
to
form
ordinary
brick
was
similarly
made
by
the
addition
of
white
sand
finely
ground
at
vairkingi
but
this
kind
of
brick
had
to
be
baked
much
more
slowly
thus
only
a
week
or
two
after
this
whole
huge
industrial
undertaking
had
begun
the
radio
man
was
in
possession
of
and
with
which
to
start
the
building
of
the
smelting
furnaces
meanwhile
myles
cabot
with
a
small
bodyguard
kept
traveling
from
one
job
to
another
giving
general
superintendence
to
the
work
and
when
everything
was
well
under
way
he
set
out
on
another
exploring
expedition
in
search
of
galena
zinc
ore
and
platinum
quivven
had
furnished
the
inspiration
for
this
trip
by
suggesting
that
the
sparkling
sands
of
a
large
river
which
ran
from
west
to
east
about
a
day
s
journey
north
of
vairkingi
might
contain
the
silver
grains
which
he
sought
so
thither
he
set
out
one
morning
with
camping
equipment
and
a
detachment
of
soldiers
all
day
they
marched
northward
across
the
level
plains
toward
evening
they
reached
a
small
estuary
of
the
main
stream
and
there
they
camped
as
the
silver
sky
pinkened
in
the
west
myles
cabot
ran
quickly
down
this
brook
to
inspect
the
sands
of
the
river
which
lay
but
a
short
distance
away
the
pink
turned
to
crimson
and
then
purple
the
darkness
crept
up
out
of
the
east
and
plunged
the
whole
face
of
the
planet
into
velvet
and
impenetrable
black
but
myles
cabot
did
not
return
to
the
camping
place
xi
att
the
terrible
when
myles
cabot
left
his
encampment
beside
the
little
brook
he
hastened
down
stream
to
where
the
brook
joined
the
big
river
along
the
edge
of
which
there
stretched
a
sandy
beach
falling
on
his
knees
he
picked
up
handful
after
handful
of
the
silver
sands
there
was
still
plenty
of
daylight
left
for
him
to
examine
the
multitude
of
shiny
metallic
particles
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
it
these
sands
held
some
metal
which
could
be
separated
out
in
much
the
same
manner
as
that
in
which
the
california
gold
miners
of
used
to
wash
for
gold
but
only
time
would
tell
whether
or
not
this
metal
was
the
platinum
which
the
radio
man
needed
for
the
grids
filaments
plates
and
wires
of
his
vacuum
tubes
on
the
morrow
he
would
wash
for
this
metal
using
the
wooden
pans
which
he
had
brought
for
that
purpose
the
precious
dust
he
would
carry
back
to
vairkingi
melt
it
into
small
lumps
if
possible
and
then
try
to
analyze
its
composition
in
his
laboratory
as
he
sat
on
the
sandy
beach
and
thus
laid
his
plans
his
thoughts
gradually
wandered
away
from
scientific
lines
and
he
began
again
to
worry
about
lilla
it
was
many
days
since
she
had
sent
the
s
o
s
which
had
recalled
him
from
earth
to
poros
whatever
she
had
feared
must
have
happened
by
now
it
was
possible
that
he
would
never
be
able
to
effect
a
return
to
cupia
why
not
then
accept
the
inevitable
settle
down
permanently
among
the
vairkings
and
solace
himself
as
best
he
could
even
an
ordinarily
stalwart
soul
would
have
done
his
best
and
have
been
satisfied
with
that
but
myles
standish
cabot
possessed
that
indomitable
will
which
had
given
rise
to
the
porovian
proverb
you
can
not
kill
a
to
such
a
man
defeat
was
impossible
he
rescue
the
princess
lilla
in
the
end
that
was
all
there
was
to
it
so
he
laid
his
plans
with
precision
as
he
sat
on
the
sandy
shore
of
the
porovian
river
in
the
crimsoning
twilight
before
the
velvet
darkness
completely
enveloped
the
planet
the
arose
from
the
sands
and
began
his
return
up
the
valley
of
the
little
estuary
but
as
he
was
hurrying
along
and
was
passing
through
a
small
grove
of
trees
a
dark
form
noiselessly
dropped
on
him
from
above
the
creature
lit
squarely
upon
his
back
wrapping
its
furry
legs
around
his
abdomen
and
its
furry
arms
around
his
neck
although
taken
completely
by
surprise
cabot
wrenched
the
creature
s
feet
apart
and
then
threw
it
over
his
head
as
a
bucking
broncho
would
throw
a
rider
a
jiujitsu
trick
which
he
had
learned
from
one
of
the
jap
gymnasts
at
college
the
roy
for
that
is
what
cabot
s
assailant
proved
to
be
scrambled
quickly
to
his
feet
although
a
bit
stunned
and
crouched
ready
to
spring
at
him
again
the
planted
his
feet
firmly
apart
clenched
his
fists
and
awaited
the
onslaught
then
when
the
creature
charged
he
met
him
on
the
point
of
the
jaw
with
a
blow
down
crashed
the
furry
one
cabot
was
rubbing
his
bruised
knuckles
and
viewing
his
fallen
antagonist
with
some
satisfaction
when
suddenly
he
was
seized
around
the
knees
from
behind
and
was
hurled
prone
by
one
of
the
neatest
football
tackles
he
had
ever
experienced
squirming
quickly
to
a
sitting
position
he
dealt
the
roy
who
held
his
legs
a
stinging
blow
beside
the
ear
the
grip
on
his
knees
loosened
and
he
was
just
about
to
scramble
erect
when
a
third
assailant
caught
him
around
the
throat
and
pulled
him
over
backward
then
scores
of
these
furry
savages
swarmed
upon
him
from
every
side
yet
still
he
fought
until
his
elbows
were
pinioned
behind
his
back
his
eyes
were
blindfolded
and
a
gag
was
placed
between
his
teeth
thereupon
he
ceased
struggling
not
because
there
was
no
fight
left
in
him
but
rather
because
he
wisely
decided
to
save
his
strength
for
some
time
when
he
might
really
need
it
so
he
offered
no
further
resistance
when
he
was
picked
up
and
thrown
across
a
pair
of
brawny
shoulders
and
carried
off
he
knew
not
whither
finally
after
what
seemed
many
hours
he
was
unceremoniously
dumped
onto
the
ground
and
then
jerked
roughly
to
his
feet
his
bandage
was
snatched
off
and
he
found
himself
standing
in
the
center
of
a
circle
of
flares
confronting
a
large
squat
and
particularly
repulsive
roy
who
sat
with
some
pretense
of
dignity
upon
a
round
boulder
in
front
of
him
beside
him
stood
another
roy
evidently
the
one
who
had
brought
him
thither
this
one
now
spoke
see
the
pretty
vairking
which
i
have
brought
if
that
s
a
vairking
the
fat
one
remarked
then
i
m
my
own
if
he
a
vairking
the
other
countered
then
why
does
he
wear
vairking
leather
armor
answer
me
vairking
or
not
the
fat
one
declared
he
will
do
very
nicely
to
string
up
by
the
heels
and
shoot
arrows
at
for
quite
evidently
he
is
no
roy
what
say
you
to
that
my
fine
target
the
guard
removed
the
gag
i
say
myles
evenly
replied
that
you
had
better
not
take
any
such
liberties
with
and
why
not
furless
the
seated
roy
sneered
first
let
me
ask
a
question
myles
said
who
is
king
of
the
roies
grod
the
silent
or
att
the
terrible
grod
the
silent
most
assuredly
why
do
you
ask
and
do
you
know
prince
otto
his
son
otto
the
bold
most
know
then
the
captive
asserted
that
i
am
no
vairking
but
rather
a
minorian
which
is
a
sort
of
creature
i
venture
you
have
never
met
before
furthermore
i
am
a
particular
personal
friend
of
otto
the
bold
he
will
not
thank
you
to
string
up
cabot
the
minorian
by
the
heels
and
shoot
arrows
into
him
i
demand
that
i
be
taken
before
prince
thereat
the
fat
roy
smiled
a
crafty
smile
i
shall
take
you
before
att
the
terrible
he
said
it
thus
became
evident
that
this
fat
chieftain
had
falsely
asserted
his
belief
in
the
kingship
of
grod
for
the
purpose
of
securing
from
myles
an
admission
as
to
which
side
the
favored
the
rest
of
the
night
myles
spent
on
a
pile
of
smelly
bedding
in
a
tent
he
was
still
bound
and
was
kept
under
constant
surveillance
by
a
frequently
changing
guard
by
morning
his
arms
below
the
elbows
had
become
completely
numb
in
spite
of
his
having
loosened
his
bonds
somewhat
by
straining
against
them
when
the
velvet
night
had
given
place
to
silver
day
the
guard
brought
some
coarse
porridge
in
a
rough
stone
bowl
which
he
held
to
the
prisoner
s
lips
until
it
was
all
consumed
myles
thanked
him
politely
and
then
asked
if
he
would
mind
chafing
the
numbed
arms
for
reply
the
soldier
kicked
him
savagely
get
up
he
ordered
the
time
is
here
to
start
the
march
you
ll
wish
the
rest
of
you
were
numb
too
when
att
the
terrible
starts
shooting
arrows
into
your
inverted
presently
myles
was
driven
into
the
open
the
tents
were
struck
and
loaded
onto
stolen
from
the
the
furry
warriors
took
up
the
march
with
their
prisoner
in
their
midst
the
fat
chief
alone
rode
in
a
cart
all
the
others
walked
by
straining
at
the
thongs
which
bound
his
arms
myles
further
loosened
them
sufficiently
to
relieve
the
pressure
on
his
blood
vessels
and
then
by
wiggling
his
fingers
he
managed
finally
to
restore
the
circulation
after
that
he
began
to
take
some
interest
in
his
surroundings
his
captors
were
a
lot
of
brutes
with
long
gangling
arms
thickset
necks
low
foreheads
and
prognathous
jaws
in
general
they
more
closely
resembled
the
anthropoid
apes
of
the
earth
than
they
resembled
the
really
human
although
furred
vairkings
their
spears
and
swords
and
flint
like
those
of
the
vairkings
only
cruder
they
marched
without
any
particular
order
or
discipline
and
jested
coarsely
with
each
other
as
they
ambled
along
after
taking
in
all
this
myles
next
turned
his
attention
to
the
country
through
which
they
were
passing
the
trail
led
upward
into
mountains
this
at
once
aroused
his
interest
here
and
there
he
noted
what
he
felt
sure
must
be
yes
and
cropping
out
of
the
rocks
on
the
left
was
an
unmistakable
rosette
of
galena
crystal
the
radio
man
was
sincerely
glad
that
he
had
been
captured
and
so
he
even
joked
jovially
with
the
soldiers
around
him
until
they
became
quite
friendly
at
one
point
their
route
lay
across
a
foaming
mountain
stream
by
means
of
a
log
bridge
as
they
were
crossing
over
one
of
the
furry
soldiers
had
the
misfortune
to
stumble
and
in
another
instant
completely
lost
his
footing
and
plunged
headlong
into
the
stream
below
he
happened
to
be
one
who
had
recently
become
particularly
chummy
with
the
captive
poor
fellow
one
of
the
guard
casually
remarked
it
s
too
bad
he
can
t
can
myles
shouted
quick
some
one
cut
my
cords
and
before
any
one
could
interfere
a
young
and
impetuous
roy
had
drawn
his
knife
and
severed
the
s
bonds
thus
permitting
him
to
dive
after
the
poor
creature
who
was
rapidly
being
washed
down
stream
by
the
swift
current
it
had
all
happened
in
an
instant
a
few
swift
strokes
brought
myles
up
to
the
other
but
it
became
no
easy
matter
to
reach
the
shore
however
the
troop
of
roies
showed
much
more
interest
in
regaining
their
captive
than
they
had
shown
in
rescuing
their
comrade
and
thus
by
the
aid
of
their
spears
finally
dragged
the
two
ashore
then
cabot
was
bound
again
and
the
march
resumed
the
carts
had
detoured
and
so
the
fat
chief
had
not
seen
the
episode
better
not
tell
him
any
one
one
of
the
guard
admonished
or
it
will
go
hard
with
the
youngster
our
leader
would
not
relish
any
chance
of
not
being
able
to
present
this
furless
vairking
to
att
the
and
will
att
shoot
arrows
into
me
myles
asked
most
myles
thought
to
himself
i
guess
they
are
right
especially
if
att
knows
how
i
was
befriended
by
arkilu
whom
he
covets
then
he
asked
and
when
am
i
to
see
the
terrible
one
morning
was
the
reply
however
myles
cabot
fell
asleep
at
the
encampment
that
night
wondering
when
he
would
get
that
radio
set
finished
for
a
talk
with
lilla
and
wondering
whether
that
really
was
galena
crystal
which
he
had
passed
on
the
road
but
galena
crystal
wasn
t
going
to
help
him
any
with
att
the
terrible
xii
companions
in
misery
in
the
morning
myles
cabot
was
to
be
brought
before
att
the
terrible
king
of
the
execution
in
the
diabolical
manner
common
to
these
furry
aborigines
namely
by
being
strung
up
by
the
heels
and
then
used
as
a
target
for
the
archery
of
the
king
in
spite
of
this
he
slept
soundly
and
dreamed
of
radio
sets
and
blast
furnaces
and
galena
mines
until
he
was
awakened
by
a
soft
furry
paw
shaking
his
shoulder
a
voice
spoke
close
to
his
ear
a
life
for
a
so
you
have
that
proverb
on
this
continent
as
well
as
in
cupia
was
his
reply
who
are
you
and
what
do
you
want
i
am
the
soldier
whom
you
saved
from
the
raging
mountain
torrent
and
what
i
want
is
to
repay
that
favor
it
is
really
true
that
you
are
a
friend
of
otto
the
bold
then
come
the
forces
of
grod
the
silent
prince
otto
s
father
are
encamped
but
a
short
distance
from
here
i
am
on
guard
over
you
for
the
moment
come
while
there
is
yet
cabot
arose
in
haste
the
other
promptly
severed
the
cords
which
bound
his
elbows
oh
how
good
it
felt
to
have
his
arms
free
once
more
he
held
them
aloft
and
flexed
and
reflexed
the
lame
and
bloodless
muscles
excruciating
pain
shot
through
the
nerves
of
his
forearm
but
it
was
pleasant
pain
easy
to
bear
for
it
portended
peace
and
rest
to
his
tired
members
he
wiggled
all
his
fingers
rapidly
and
the
pain
gave
way
to
a
prickly
tingling
which
in
turn
gradually
faded
off
as
the
blood
coursed
freely
through
his
veins
and
arteries
once
more
he
drew
a
deep
sigh
of
relief
come
the
guard
commanded
together
the
two
left
the
tent
and
threaded
their
way
among
the
other
tents
out
of
the
camp
and
down
a
rocky
hillside
path
the
roy
in
advance
with
myles
following
holding
the
other
s
hand
for
guidance
myles
lost
all
sense
of
direction
in
the
jet
black
starless
night
but
the
other
born
and
reared
on
poros
and
hence
used
to
the
daily
recurrences
of
twelve
hours
of
absolute
darkness
walked
ahead
and
seemed
to
know
where
he
was
going
finally
after
about
two
hours
of
this
groping
treadmill
progress
lights
appeared
ahead
and
presently
there
came
the
sentry
s
challenge
halt
who
is
there
two
messengers
with
word
for
grod
the
silent
cabot
s
conductor
replied
in
an
aside
cabot
interestedly
inquired
how
does
it
happen
that
this
camp
is
guarded
whereas
the
camp
which
besieged
the
village
of
sur
was
not
there
is
no
need
to
post
sentinels
when
fighting
against
the
vairkings
for
vairkings
never
go
out
in
the
dark
but
we
roies
are
why
then
did
we
meet
no
sentinels
when
leaving
your
camp
because
we
were
going
we
passed
one
but
he
did
not
challenge
us
coming
would
be
at
this
point
the
hostile
guard
interposed
stop
that
whispering
among
yourselves
ho
there
a
light
whereat
a
small
detachment
arrived
on
the
double
quick
with
torches
the
leader
shaded
his
eyes
with
one
palm
and
inspected
myles
and
his
companion
carefully
this
is
a
vairking
he
said
in
surprise
noting
the
leather
trappings
of
the
you
are
spies
seize
them
in
an
instant
they
were
seized
and
bound
and
thrown
into
separate
tents
under
guard
when
morning
came
myles
was
fed
and
then
led
before
grod
the
silent
the
smiled
ingratiatingly
as
he
entered
but
there
was
no
sign
of
recognition
on
the
stern
face
of
the
king
of
the
roies
who
are
you
the
latter
asked
and
what
are
you
doing
here
i
am
cabot
the
minorian
was
the
reply
a
recently
escaped
prisoner
of
att
the
do
not
mention
that
accursed
name
in
my
presence
thundered
the
king
then
i
do
not
seem
to
recall
your
name
but
your
face
looks
familiar
where
have
i
seen
you
before
in
the
ravine
near
grod
s
brow
clouded
i
remember
you
felled
me
with
your
fist
said
he
darkly
then
brightening
a
bit
but
you
spared
me
why
because
your
death
would
please
the
roy
whose
name
you
do
not
permit
me
to
you
improve
grod
declared
smiling
know
then
that
we
roies
hold
to
the
maxim
a
life
for
a
accordingly
i
shall
set
you
free
and
shall
content
myself
with
shooting
arrows
into
merely
the
soldier
who
brought
you
you
give
me
a
life
for
a
life
unconditionally
asked
myles
then
give
me
the
life
of
the
poor
soldier
who
saved
me
from
the
unmentionable
one
shoot
your
arrows
into
my
body
very
magnanimous
of
you
grod
said
and
really
it
makes
but
little
difference
to
me
just
whom
i
practice
archery
upon
ho
guard
bring
the
other
prisoner
one
of
the
soldiery
accordingly
withdrew
and
presently
returned
quivven
of
all
persons
cabot
gasped
and
so
did
the
vairking
maiden
then
both
uttered
simultaneously
the
single
word
you
the
savage
chief
smiled
said
he
a
slight
mistake
guard
i
meant
you
to
bring
the
roy
soldier
who
was
captured
with
this
furless
one
early
this
morning
but
evidently
it
has
turned
out
to
be
a
fortunate
mistake
for
it
has
brought
to
my
attention
the
fact
that
this
common
vairking
man
and
this
noble
vairking
lady
are
while
the
roy
was
speaking
an
idea
occurred
to
cabot
he
was
entitled
by
the
code
of
honor
of
this
savage
race
to
save
a
life
chivalry
demanded
that
he
save
the
life
of
this
maiden
rather
than
that
of
himself
or
even
the
soldier
who
had
rescued
him
from
att
the
terrible
yet
what
would
lilla
think
did
he
not
owe
it
to
lilla
to
save
his
own
life
in
order
that
he
might
some
day
return
across
the
boiling
seas
to
save
from
the
unknown
peril
which
menaced
her
for
him
to
sacrifice
himself
and
her
or
even
merely
himself
for
the
sake
of
some
strange
woman
would
fill
lilla
with
consuming
jealousy
luckily
lilla
was
not
here
to
see
him
make
his
choice
he
was
an
officer
and
a
gentleman
to
whom
but
one
course
lay
open
and
if
he
decided
in
the
way
that
would
displease
lilla
then
that
very
decision
would
forever
prevent
lilla
from
knowing
so
his
mind
made
up
he
spoke
o
king
you
still
owe
me
a
life
inasmuch
as
your
guard
has
made
the
mistake
of
substituting
this
young
lady
for
the
roy
warrior
whose
life
i
had
elected
to
save
i
now
accept
the
substitution
and
elect
that
you
shall
spare
her
life
in
place
of
quivven
the
golden
flame
stared
at
him
with
tears
of
gratitude
and
appreciation
in
her
azure
eyes
grod
the
silent
smiled
knowingly
in
a
manner
which
infuriated
myles
but
fortunately
quivven
did
not
notice
this
so
myles
let
it
pass
then
the
roy
king
spoke
we
shall
see
about
that
later
meanwhile
guard
bring
in
the
the
guard
sheepishly
withdrew
and
soon
returned
with
the
soldier
who
had
befriended
myles
why
did
you
rescue
this
furless
vairking
who
was
a
prisoner
of
your
forces
grod
asked
the
newcomer
because
he
rescued
me
from
a
mountain
torrent
o
king
was
the
reply
a
life
for
a
quite
true
grod
admitted
nodding
his
head
contemplatively
but
was
it
altogether
necessary
to
that
end
that
you
leave
your
own
forces
no
o
king
the
soldier
replied
but
i
fain
would
battle
on
your
side
i
have
had
quite
enough
of
the
fat
one
who
commands
our
good
cried
grod
clapping
his
hands
we
shall
need
every
man
we
can
muster
thus
have
you
bought
your
own
life
and
freedom
unbind
him
guards
and
give
him
weapons
so
that
he
may
fight
for
us
as
for
you
you
yellow
minx
the
quicker
you
get
out
of
here
the
better
it
will
suit
me
we
are
at
war
and
women
have
no
place
in
warfare
therefore
i
gladly
give
you
your
life
which
this
furless
one
had
purchased
do
not
think
he
continued
that
i
do
not
know
who
you
are
or
that
i
do
not
realize
that
i
could
hold
you
for
high
ransom
but
for
the
present
it
suits
my
purposes
to
release
you
for
my
mind
is
a
road
and
at
present
i
am
engaged
in
an
important
and
highly
personal
war
besides
if
i
were
to
keep
you
my
enemy
might
get
hold
of
you
and
collect
the
ransom
himself
which
would
never
do
twelve
days
from
now
if
i
should
be
in
need
of
carts
a
messenger
from
me
will
call
at
the
palace
of
theoph
the
grim
and
if
you
are
at
all
grateful
you
will
make
me
a
present
of
about
twenty
sturdy
wagons
as
for
you
turning
to
myles
your
life
is
mine
since
you
failed
to
redeem
it
some
day
i
may
call
upon
you
for
it
but
for
the
present
i
wish
to
use
it
you
are
detailed
as
my
personal
representative
to
escort
this
lady
safely
to
vairkingi
now
both
of
you
get
out
of
here
for
i
have
more
important
things
to
do
i
must
put
my
army
on
the
one
of
the
guards
stepped
up
to
myles
and
cut
his
bonds
quivven
had
not
been
bound
may
i
have
arms
o
king
so
that
i
can
fulfill
your
mission
with
credit
to
you
myles
asked
with
a
twinkle
in
his
gray
eyes
you
keep
on
improving
grod
replied
yes
you
may
here
take
my
own
sword
you
are
a
brave
man
and
an
able
warrior
as
my
chin
well
remembers
may
the
builder
grant
that
some
day
we
shall
fight
side
by
this
gave
cabot
an
idea
why
can
that
not
be
now
he
suggested
why
not
form
an
alliance
with
vairkingi
against
the
unmentionable
one
but
grod
the
silent
shook
his
head
no
he
said
positively
it
can
not
be
in
the
first
place
the
unmentionable
one
is
himself
seeking
to
make
such
an
alliance
against
me
and
in
the
second
place
this
is
my
own
private
fight
i
have
then
cabot
had
a
further
idea
about
the
wagons
he
said
would
you
mind
sending
for
them
to
my
brickyard
north
of
vairkingi
that
would
be
more
very
well
grod
replied
roy
warriors
then
supplied
the
two
prisoners
with
portable
rations
and
escorted
them
for
quite
a
distance
from
the
camp
until
they
struck
a
mountain
trail
this
the
escort
informed
them
led
to
vairkingi
there
the
roies
left
myles
and
quivven
alone
the
first
thing
that
she
asked
was
with
all
these
mountains
full
of
warring
roies
do
you
believe
that
we
shall
be
safe
i
think
so
myles
replied
the
very
fact
that
they
are
at
war
will
keep
them
much
too
busy
to
bother
about
us
come
as
they
hurried
down
the
trail
each
related
his
or
her
adventures
to
the
other
cabot
s
have
already
been
set
down
as
for
quivven
she
had
gone
with
a
few
soldiers
to
hunt
for
myles
after
his
prospecting
party
had
returned
and
reported
his
disappearance
by
the
river
but
her
party
had
been
killed
and
she
had
been
taken
prisoner
did
grod
treat
you
with
respect
myles
asked
with
clenched
fists
absolutely
she
replied
tossing
her
pretty
head
i
never
knew
a
man
so
impersonal
i
am
accustomed
to
have
men
recognize
my
presence
and
pay
some
attention
to
my
existence
but
this
i
might
just
as
well
have
been
a
piece
of
furniture
or
one
of
his
servants
i
don
t
believe
he
knows
now
what
color
my
eyes
are
or
whether
i
m
pretty
or
not
and
you
re
just
as
bad
as
he
is
she
added
somewhat
irrelevantly
your
eyes
are
blue
and
you
are
very
pretty
cabot
replied
in
fact
you
closely
resemble
my
own
wife
the
beautiful
princess
lilla
who
waits
for
me
far
across
the
boiling
which
reminds
me
to
ask
quivven
said
abruptly
how
successful
was
your
expedition
apart
from
your
being
captured
and
getting
yourself
into
all
kinds
of
trouble
so
he
told
her
about
the
glistening
metallic
particles
in
the
sands
of
the
river
also
how
he
had
found
what
were
probably
and
galena
then
they
discussed
in
detail
his
plans
for
his
various
factories
from
time
to
time
they
munched
some
of
the
food
which
had
been
given
them
the
day
quickly
sped
and
evening
drew
near
yet
still
they
were
upon
the
mountain
road
with
no
sight
of
vairkingi
or
of
any
landmark
familiar
to
either
of
them
quivven
was
for
stopping
and
resting
but
myles
urged
her
on
no
matter
how
tired
you
are
he
said
it
is
not
safe
to
stop
in
this
strange
so
still
she
struggled
on
the
sky
darkened
without
the
usual
pinkening
of
the
west
all
too
well
they
knew
what
that
of
the
tropical
storms
so
common
on
poros
and
they
were
right
the
storm
broke
the
thunder
roared
in
one
continuous
volume
of
sound
the
lightning
and
the
rain
alike
poured
down
in
continuous
sheets
the
trail
became
a
mountain
torrent
so
that
they
had
to
cease
their
journey
and
crawl
upon
a
huge
boulder
in
order
to
avoid
being
engulfed
by
the
water
the
rain
stopped
as
abruptly
as
it
had
begun
again
the
silver
sky
appeared
overhead
the
extempore
brook
rapidly
disappeared
but
left
in
its
wake
a
wet
muddy
and
slippery
trail
down
which
the
two
took
up
their
journey
once
more
several
times
quivven
stumbled
and
fell
until
at
last
her
companion
had
to
help
her
in
order
to
keep
her
going
at
all
but
in
spite
of
this
assistance
she
finally
broke
down
and
cried
i
shall
not
go
one
step
farther
she
asserted
myles
seated
himself
beside
her
and
talked
to
her
as
one
would
soothe
a
child
and
that
was
what
she
was
a
tired
little
child
you
can
t
stay
here
he
urged
the
ground
is
damp
the
night
is
coming
on
and
your
fur
is
sopping
i
don
t
care
anything
about
anything
she
sobbed
all
that
i
know
is
that
i
positively
can
not
go
so
he
decided
that
it
would
be
necessary
to
change
his
tactics
i
am
ashamed
of
you
he
replied
you
the
daughter
of
a
king
and
can
t
stand
a
little
exercise
why
i
believe
you
are
just
plain
for
reply
she
jumped
to
her
feet
in
a
sudden
rage
oh
you
beast
she
cried
you
insulting
beast
you
common
soldier
you
i
ll
show
you
that
i
can
stand
as
much
hardship
as
the
pampered
womenfolk
of
your
cupia
though
the
men
of
my
country
even
our
common
soldiers
would
be
gentlemanly
enough
not
to
force
a
lady
to
endure
any
more
than
is
absolutely
necessary
oh
i
hate
you
i
hate
you
i
hate
you
you
are
not
being
forced
to
endure
more
than
is
necessary
her
escort
harshly
replied
in
the
first
place
it
necessary
to
go
on
and
in
the
second
place
i
am
not
forcing
you
can
go
on
or
not
just
as
you
see
fit
but
as
for
me
i
don
t
intend
to
spend
the
night
here
in
this
wet
valley
for
reply
quivven
raced
ahead
of
him
with
oh
how
i
hate
you
and
disappeared
around
a
turn
in
the
trail
xiii
further
progress
his
change
of
tactics
had
worked
although
it
made
him
feel
like
a
brute
but
only
by
arousing
quivven
s
anger
could
he
stir
her
to
continue
the
journey
and
to
remain
would
have
menaced
her
safety
and
her
health
she
had
a
good
head
start
of
him
the
silver
sky
was
turning
crimson
in
the
west
night
was
coming
on
so
he
hurried
after
her
down
the
wet
and
slippery
trail
at
last
it
became
so
dark
that
he
had
to
slow
down
and
walk
and
finally
merely
grope
his
way
shoving
his
feet
ahead
one
after
the
other
in
order
to
be
sure
to
keep
to
the
trail
and
not
to
stumble
time
and
again
his
foot
would
touch
something
soft
which
he
would
picture
as
some
strange
and
weird
porovian
animal
a
gnooper
for
instance
quickly
he
would
withdraw
the
foot
then
waiting
in
suspense
for
the
creature
either
to
go
away
or
to
spring
upon
him
at
last
he
would
cautiously
push
his
foot
forward
touch
the
object
again
kick
it
slightly
and
find
that
it
was
only
a
clump
of
porovian
grass
or
a
rotted
piece
of
lichen
log
poor
quivven
how
terrified
must
be
at
such
encounters
after
a
while
he
got
a
bit
used
to
these
occurrences
and
accordingly
each
succeeding
one
of
them
delayed
him
less
than
the
preceding
you
know
he
said
to
himself
this
will
keep
on
until
finally
one
of
these
obstacles
will
actually
turn
out
to
be
a
gnooper
and
it
will
eat
me
alive
before
i
can
get
out
of
the
just
then
his
groping
foot
touched
another
of
these
soft
objects
get
out
of
my
way
cabot
shouted
and
gave
it
a
kick
but
this
time
it
was
not
attached
to
the
soil
it
yielded
and
wriggled
a
bit
then
it
gave
a
peculiar
groaning
sound
myles
leaped
backward
and
waited
but
nothing
happened
so
he
tried
to
circle
the
creature
again
the
groan
his
scientific
curiosity
got
the
better
of
his
caution
he
approached
once
more
and
investigated
more
closely
reaching
down
with
his
hand
the
animal
was
covered
with
wet
and
muddy
fur
it
was
quivven
tenderly
he
raised
the
crumpled
form
in
his
arms
and
groped
on
down
the
treacherous
trail
myles
wondered
how
long
he
could
bear
up
with
this
dead
weight
in
his
arms
but
just
as
he
was
beginning
to
stagger
the
road
gave
a
turn
and
flattened
out
and
there
before
him
were
lights
the
flares
and
bonfires
of
a
city
they
had
reached
the
plain
quivven
he
cried
joyfully
this
is
home
there
ahead
lies
vairkingi
but
she
made
no
reply
her
body
was
cold
and
still
quickly
he
laid
her
on
the
ground
and
placed
one
ear
to
her
chest
thank
the
great
builder
her
heart
still
beat
so
he
chafed
her
hands
and
feet
and
worked
her
arms
violently
back
and
forth
until
she
began
to
groan
protestingly
quivven
he
cried
wake
up
we
are
home
are
you
here
myles
she
murmured
faintly
and
you
won
t
make
me
walk
any
more
then
i
ll
wake
up
for
you
she
murmured
cheerfully
and
promptly
fell
fast
asleep
again
lifting
her
tenderly
in
his
arms
he
resumed
the
journey
on
reaching
the
city
he
circled
the
wall
until
he
came
to
one
of
the
gates
where
he
stood
the
girl
on
the
ground
and
shook
her
gently
into
consciousness
where
am
i
she
asked
at
the
gates
of
vairkingi
myles
answered
she
ran
her
hands
rapidly
over
her
fur
oh
but
i
can
t
go
in
like
this
she
wailed
i
m
covered
with
mud
from
head
to
foot
think
how
i
must
look
no
i
refuse
to
go
if
you
stay
here
he
urged
mildly
then
when
morning
comes
every
one
will
see
you
the
princess
quivven
bedraggled
with
mud
hanging
around
outside
the
city
gates
better
far
to
go
in
now
and
take
a
chance
of
being
seen
by
only
one
oh
you
beast
you
beast
she
sobbed
beating
him
futilely
with
her
tiny
paws
for
reply
he
seized
her
in
his
arms
swung
her
across
one
hip
and
shouted
open
wide
the
gates
of
vairkingi
for
cabot
the
minorian
magician
to
jud
the
and
to
his
excellency
theoph
the
grim
the
gates
swung
open
and
the
sentinel
stared
at
them
with
surprise
and
some
amusement
myles
whipped
out
his
sword
and
the
smile
froze
on
the
soldier
s
face
thus
do
i
teach
men
not
to
laugh
at
myles
cabot
the
growled
remember
that
you
have
seen
and
he
handed
the
soldier
the
choice
blade
of
grod
the
silent
the
soldier
smiled
again
i
have
seen
nothing
but
a
roy
whom
i
robbed
of
his
sword
and
drove
off
into
the
darkness
it
is
a
fine
sword
and
i
will
remember
that
i
have
seen
nothing
may
the
great
builder
bless
myles
cabot
the
cabot
glanced
at
his
burden
quivven
the
beautiful
no
wonder
she
did
not
want
to
be
seen
it
always
humiliates
a
lady
not
to
look
her
best
in
public
but
by
the
same
token
no
one
could
possibly
recognize
her
he
might
perfectly
well
have
saved
the
sword
so
he
passed
on
through
the
city
streets
finally
he
had
to
put
the
girl
down
and
ask
her
to
help
him
find
the
way
which
she
did
grudgingly
at
the
gate
of
jud
s
compound
myles
again
swung
her
across
his
hip
before
he
demanded
entrance
no
swords
this
time
for
diplomacy
would
take
the
place
of
payment
myles
cabot
demanding
entrance
he
cried
the
local
guard
inspected
them
carefully
by
the
light
of
his
torch
it
is
cabot
all
right
he
replied
and
you
look
as
though
you
had
seen
some
hard
fighting
but
who
is
this
with
you
a
girl
of
the
roies
answered
myles
that
is
what
the
fighting
was
not
for
mine
the
soldier
asserted
grimacing
though
there
is
no
accounting
for
tastes
they
are
filthy
little
beasts
and
spitfires
as
well
so
i
m
told
my
advice
to
you
sir
is
to
throw
it
down
a
quivven
wriggled
protestingly
perhaps
i
will
myles
laughed
at
their
own
gate
at
last
he
placed
her
once
more
on
her
feet
whereat
she
shook
herself
free
raced
into
the
house
slammed
the
door
of
her
room
cabot
himself
went
right
to
bed
without
waiting
to
wash
or
anything
and
dropped
instantly
to
sleep
the
moment
he
touched
his
pile
of
bedding
yet
so
intent
was
he
on
wasting
no
time
in
getting
cupia
on
the
air
that
he
was
up
early
the
next
morning
he
found
his
laboratory
force
sadly
demoralized
owing
to
the
absence
of
quivven
and
himself
but
he
quickly
brought
order
out
of
chaos
and
set
the
men
to
work
on
their
first
real
construction
job
to
which
all
the
other
work
had
been
mere
preliminary
steps
quivven
kept
to
her
rooms
but
one
of
the
other
maids
roguishly
informed
him
the
golden
one
says
she
hates
now
that
his
were
ready
myles
cabot
laid
out
on
paper
the
plans
for
his
smelting
plant
all
the
units
of
which
were
to
be
lined
with
first
he
designed
a
furnace
for
roasting
his
ore
this
furnace
was
to
be
in
two
sections
one
above
the
other
the
lower
holding
the
charcoal
fire
and
the
upper
holding
the
later
he
planned
to
use
the
sulphur
fumes
of
this
roaster
to
make
sulphuric
acid
which
in
turn
he
would
use
to
make
sal
ammoniac
for
his
batteries
but
at
present
he
had
not
yet
figured
out
this
process
in
detail
the
smelting
furnace
for
smelting
the
roasted
ore
into
was
to
consist
of
a
chimney
about
two
feet
in
diameter
sloping
sharply
outward
for
about
two
feet
and
thence
sloping
gradually
inward
again
for
a
height
of
about
ten
feet
near
the
bottom
were
to
be
a
number
of
small
holes
leading
from
an
air
passage
this
air
passage
and
the
vent
for
the
hot
flames
from
the
top
of
the
smelter
were
to
run
in
parallel
pipes
made
of
hollow
brick
tile
to
two
chambers
containing
a
checkerwork
design
of
the
two
pipes
were
to
be
interchangeable
so
that
when
the
exhaust
had
heated
one
of
the
checkerwork
grids
to
a
red
heat
the
pipes
could
be
switched
and
the
incoming
air
would
be
warmed
by
passing
through
the
heated
grid
from
gnooper
hide
and
wood
he
could
easily
construct
bellows
to
pump
in
the
air
for
the
blast
molten
and
slag
would
be
separately
run
off
through
two
separate
openings
at
different
levels
near
the
bottom
of
the
blast
furnace
to
further
refine
the
matte
he
designed
a
bessemer
converter
that
is
to
say
a
box
of
layers
of
fire
clay
the
inner
layer
being
very
rich
in
quartz
sand
this
barrel
when
filled
with
molten
matte
would
be
laid
on
its
side
and
a
hot
blast
introduced
through
holes
near
this
side
would
convert
the
matte
into
pure
copper
in
about
two
hours
the
first
converter
which
he
made
was
rather
small
as
he
expected
that
it
would
not
last
very
well
without
metal
reinforcements
and
of
course
he
would
have
no
metal
for
reenforcing
purposes
until
after
he
had
run
off
at
least
one
heat
for
the
extraction
of
iron
he
made
crucibles
of
fireclay
which
he
set
in
deep
holes
in
the
ground
on
the
second
morning
after
the
unpleasant
homecoming
quivven
appeared
all
her
rage
had
burned
out
and
she
was
meek
and
subdued
with
downcast
eyes
she
reported
to
myles
i
am
ready
to
go
to
work
with
a
welcoming
smile
he
patted
her
shoulder
whereat
her
old
anger
started
to
flare
again
but
this
one
remaining
ember
merely
flickered
and
died
out
and
she
submitted
with
a
shrug
of
resignation
so
the
radio
man
explained
to
her
his
plans
for
the
furnaces
then
leaving
her
in
charge
of
the
work
he
set
out
once
more
to
the
river
of
the
silver
sands
this
time
accompanied
by
a
heavy
guard
of
vairking
soldiers
and
flying
a
blue
flag
as
agreed
on
with
prince
otto
of
the
roies
as
he
was
departing
quivven
flung
her
arms
around
him
and
begged
him
not
to
go
to
certain
destruction
but
he
gently
disengaged
himself
smiling
indulgently
at
this
show
of
childish
affection
my
dear
little
girl
he
admonished
most
of
our
troubles
last
time
came
from
your
following
me
this
time
i
warn
you
that
i
shall
be
very
displeased
if
you
fail
to
stick
closely
to
home
and
complete
my
two
magic
furnaces
for
me
promise
me
that
you
so
with
tears
of
dread
in
her
blue
eyes
she
promised
and
the
expedition
set
forth
they
were
gone
about
five
days
the
trip
proved
uneventful
from
any
except
a
scientific
viewpoint
they
returned
bearing
several
pounds
of
silvery
grains
placermined
from
the
river
sands
also
some
large
lumps
of
galena
crystal
and
nearly
a
ton
of
they
found
that
under
the
skillful
direction
of
little
quivven
the
furnaces
were
nearly
completed
quivven
the
golden
flame
was
overjoyed
at
cabot
s
safe
return
while
even
he
had
to
confess
considerable
relief
he
complimented
her
warmly
on
the
progress
of
the
furnaces
and
noted
her
pleasure
at
his
expressions
of
approval
a
few
details
which
had
perplexed
her
were
quickly
straightened
out
and
the
work
was
rushed
to
completion
he
next
tested
the
silver
grains
which
he
had
brought
from
the
river
his
method
was
a
very
simple
one
invented
by
himself
it
consisted
in
filling
a
clay
cup
with
water
and
weighing
it
then
weighing
a
quantity
of
the
metal
and
then
putting
this
metal
in
the
water
and
weighing
the
whole
a
simple
mathematical
calculation
from
these
three
weights
gave
him
the
specific
gravity
of
the
metal
this
process
was
repeated
a
number
of
times
to
avoid
error
and
gave
as
an
average
the
figure
which
he
remembered
to
be
the
specific
gravity
of
pure
platinum
as
a
further
test
he
hammered
some
of
the
supposed
platinum
into
a
thin
sheet
and
attempted
without
success
to
melt
it
then
he
laid
a
sliver
of
one
of
his
lead
bullets
on
it
and
tried
again
with
the
result
that
the
lead
melted
and
burned
a
hole
through
the
metal
sheet
this
test
convinced
him
that
he
truly
had
found
platinum
cabot
next
turned
his
attention
to
glass
making
for
ordinary
glass
he
would
need
quartz
soda
potash
and
limestone
the
reason
for
his
employing
both
soda
and
potash
instead
of
merely
one
or
the
other
was
that
together
they
would
have
a
lower
fusing
point
and
thus
be
easier
for
him
to
handle
with
his
crude
equipment
for
glass
for
his
tubes
he
would
use
litharge
in
place
of
the
limestone
the
quartz
and
the
limestone
were
already
available
soda
would
be
a
byproduct
of
his
sal
ammoniac
when
he
got
around
to
making
it
but
this
would
not
be
until
he
had
made
sulphuric
acid
from
his
copper
ore
which
was
a
most
complicated
process
as
he
remembered
it
potash
could
be
got
simply
by
dripping
water
through
evaporating
the
water
roasting
the
sediment
dissolving
again
in
water
letting
the
impurities
settle
and
then
evaporating
the
clear
liquid
and
roasting
again
he
started
this
process
at
once
but
he
had
no
idea
how
to
make
litharge
furthermore
he
could
not
blow
his
glass
until
he
had
metal
tubes
so
he
abandoned
further
steps
for
the
present
while
he
was
pondering
over
these
problems
a
messenger
arrived
demanding
his
immediate
presence
at
the
quarters
of
jud
the
jud
was
in
a
state
of
great
excitement
when
the
arrived
said
jud
do
you
remember
what
you
told
me
about
the
beasts
of
the
south
who
swim
through
the
air
talk
soundless
speech
and
use
magic
slingshots
like
yours
which
you
captured
from
the
roies
near
sur
yes
cabot
replied
i
hope
that
by
this
time
i
have
given
sufficient
demonstration
of
my
truthfulness
so
that
you
now
believe
the
oh
i
believed
it
at
the
time
jud
hastily
explained
but
now
i
have
proof
of
it
for
we
have
captured
one
of
these
beasts
that
is
we
it
is
one
of
them
i
want
you
to
see
and
identify
it
before
we
present
it
to
theoph
the
thereby
displaying
commendable
foresight
myles
commented
where
is
this
formian
in
a
cage
in
the
zoo
the
vairking
noble
replied
come
i
will
take
you
so
together
the
two
threaded
the
streets
of
vairkingi
to
the
zoo
this
was
part
of
the
city
which
the
had
never
before
visited
its
denizens
fascinated
him
there
were
huge
water
snakes
with
humanlike
hands
there
were
spherical
beasts
with
a
row
of
legs
around
the
equator
a
row
of
eyes
around
the
tropic
of
cancer
and
a
circular
mouth
rimmed
with
teeth
at
the
north
pole
there
but
at
this
point
jud
urged
him
on
into
another
room
where
he
promptly
forgot
all
the
other
creatures
in
the
sight
which
met
his
eyes
in
a
large
wooden
cage
in
the
center
of
the
room
was
an
enraged
gnawing
at
the
bars
while
a
score
or
so
of
vairking
warriors
stood
around
and
prodded
him
with
spears
stop
jud
shouted
at
the
soldiery
whereat
they
all
fell
back
obediently
this
called
the
attention
of
the
imprisoned
beast
to
the
newcomers
so
he
looked
up
and
stared
at
them
cabot
stared
back
then
he
rushed
forward
to
the
cage
xiv
old
friends
doggo
he
cried
doggo
they
told
me
you
were
dead
but
of
course
all
this
was
lost
on
the
radio
speech
sense
of
the
prisoner
vairking
soldiers
interposed
their
spears
between
myles
cabot
and
what
they
believed
was
sure
destruction
at
the
jaws
of
the
black
beast
cabot
recoiled
jud
he
called
out
order
off
your
henchmen
i
am
not
crazy
nor
do
i
court
death
this
creature
is
the
only
one
of
the
formians
whom
i
can
control
he
will
prove
a
valuable
ally
for
us
if
i
can
persuade
him
to
forgive
the
indignities
which
your
men
have
already
heaped
upon
i
do
not
believe
you
jud
replied
for
how
can
men
communicate
with
beasts
especially
with
strange
beasts
such
as
this
the
like
of
which
man
ne
er
set
eyes
on
before
remember
that
i
am
a
magician
myles
returned
somewhat
testily
then
seeing
that
jud
was
still
obdurate
he
addressed
the
guards
you
know
me
for
a
magician
yes
they
sullenly
admitted
and
you
know
the
magic
on
which
i
am
now
engaged
and
to
which
all
of
my
recent
expeditions
relate
yes
one
replied
you
seek
to
call
down
the
lightnings
of
heaven
and
harness
them
to
transport
your
words
across
the
boiling
rightly
spoken
the
radio
man
asserted
therefore
if
you
do
not
stand
aside
i
shall
call
those
lightnings
down
for
another
purpose
namely
to
blast
you
stand
aside
one
of
the
guards
spoke
to
another
why
should
we
risk
our
lives
to
save
his
let
the
magician
save
himself
so
they
stood
aside
myles
stepped
up
to
the
cage
and
he
and
doggo
each
patted
the
other
s
cheek
through
the
bars
jud
the
sheepishly
explained
i
knew
that
you
were
speaking
the
truth
but
i
wished
to
learn
what
method
you
would
use
to
handle
the
soldiers
you
did
bunk
the
ejaculated
well
knowing
that
the
vairking
would
not
understand
him
what
means
that
word
jud
inquired
much
interested
that
myles
replied
grinning
is
a
complimentary
term
often
applied
on
my
own
planet
the
earth
to
the
remarks
of
our
great
jud
highly
complimented
let
it
go
at
that
myles
now
ordered
paper
and
a
charcoal
pencil
and
began
a
conversation
with
his
ant
friend
they
told
me
you
were
dead
he
wrote
or
i
never
would
have
left
the
city
of
yuriana
or
deserted
your
my
cause
died
with
my
daughter
the
queen
doggo
replied
i
alone
survive
i
escaped
by
plane
and
have
been
flitting
around
the
country
ever
since
until
my
alcohol
gave
out
then
these
furry
cupians
captured
me
they
got
me
with
a
net
so
that
i
could
not
fight
back
also
i
was
distant
from
my
airship
at
the
time
or
it
would
have
gone
hard
with
them
for
the
ship
is
well
stocked
with
bombs
and
rifle
cartridges
and
one
rifle
now
tell
me
of
yourself
how
do
you
stand
with
these
furry
cupians
they
are
not
myles
wrote
they
are
vairkings
a
race
much
like
myself
who
send
messages
with
their
mouths
and
with
their
ears
instead
of
using
their
antennae
for
both
as
the
cupians
and
you
formians
do
do
you
remember
the
old
legend
of
cupia
that
creatures
like
me
dwell
beyond
the
boiling
seas
well
it
appears
to
have
been
true
though
how
any
one
could
have
known
or
even
suspected
it
is
a
mystery
to
you
have
not
yet
told
me
how
you
stand
the
reminded
him
they
recognize
me
as
a
great
magician
myles
answered
and
i
have
promised
to
build
them
a
radio
set
and
to
lead
them
to
victory
over
the
just
as
you
did
for
the
cupians
doggo
mused
but
you
will
have
a
harder
task
here
for
these
furry
creatures
appear
to
know
no
metals
nor
any
of
the
arts
save
they
patted
each
other
s
cheeks
again
then
before
any
one
could
interfere
myles
cabot
unbolted
the
door
of
the
cage
and
out
walked
doggo
a
free
ant
once
more
the
soldiery
and
jud
with
them
promptly
scattered
to
the
four
walls
of
the
room
come
over
here
jud
myles
invited
and
meet
my
is
unless
you
are
oh
no
i
do
not
fear
him
jud
the
replied
but
i
do
not
consider
it
consistent
with
the
dignity
of
my
position
to
be
seen
fraternizing
with
a
wild
it
was
typical
myles
laughed
then
he
led
the
huge
ant
home
with
him
to
his
quarters
quivven
was
amazed
but
not
at
all
frightened
at
the
great
black
creature
and
when
an
introduction
had
been
effected
on
paper
she
and
doggo
developed
quite
a
strong
liking
for
each
other
as
soon
as
the
formian
had
been
fed
and
assigned
to
a
room
in
the
improvement
over
the
menagerie
by
the
host
and
hostess
took
him
on
a
tour
of
inspection
of
their
laboratory
with
the
true
scientific
spirit
so
characteristic
of
the
cultured
but
warlike
race
which
once
dominated
cupia
doggo
plunged
at
once
into
the
spirit
of
the
almost
task
which
myles
had
undertaken
and
it
soon
became
evident
that
the
new
comer
would
prove
to
be
an
invaluable
accession
his
scientific
training
would
dovetail
exactly
with
that
of
the
and
would
supplement
it
at
every
point
almost
at
the
very
start
he
suggested
a
solution
of
the
problems
which
had
been
puzzling

of
the
process
of
sulphuric
acid
manufacture
had
been
that
it
required
a
complicated
roasting
furnace
two
filtering
towers
and
a
tunnel
about
two
hundred
feet
long
made
of
lead
and
into
which
nitric
acid
fumes
had
to
be
injected
his
recollection
of
nitric
acid
manufacture
was
that
it
required
sulphuric
acid
among
other
ingredients
so
how
was
he
to
make
either
acid
without
first
having
the
other
and
furthermore
where
was
he
to
procure
enough
lead
to
build
a
tunnel
doggo
solved
these
problems
very
avoiding
them
what
do
you
need
sulphuric
add
for
he
wrote
merely
to
use
in
making
hydrochloric
acid
wrote
the
in
reply
and
that
to
use
in
making
sal
ammoniac
for
my
do
you
need
nitric
acid
for
anything
except
the
manufacture
of
sulphuric
then
doggo
suggested
let
us
make
our
sal
ammoniac
directly
from
its
elements
we
shall
build
a
series
of
about
twenty
vertical
retorts
as
soon
as
you
have
smelted
your
iron
these
we
shall
fill
with
damp
salt
pressed
into
blocks
and
dried
we
shall
heat
these
retorts
with
charcoal
fires
and
through
them
we
shall
pass
then
air
and
the
sulphur
fumes
of
your
after
about
fifteen
days
we
shall
daily
cut
out
the
first
retort
dump
out
the
soda
which
has
formed
in
it
refill
it
and
place
it
at
the
farther
end
of
the
series
the
liquid
which
condenses
at
the
end
of
the
series
will
be
diluted
hydrochloric
acid
by
passing
the
fumes
of
roast
through
it
we
shall
convert
it
into
sal
ammoniac
accordingly
the
quicker
they
started
their
foundry
operations
the
better
by
this
time
chalcopyrite
quartz
and
charcoal
were
present
at
vairkingi
in
large
quantities
the
ore
was
first
roasted
and
then
was
piled
into
the
smelter
with
the
quartz
and
charcoal
the
were
started
fire
was
inserted
through
the
slaghole
and
soon
a
raging
pillar
of
flame
served
notice
on
all
vairkingi
that
the
of
the
great
magician
was
in
full
blast
by
this
time
it
was
night
but
no
one
thought
of
stopping
of
course
there
were
complications
the
furry
soldiers
deserted
the
pumps
at
the
first
roar
of
flame
but
doggo
instantly
stepped
into
the
breach
and
operated
all
of
the
bellows
with
his
various
legs
finally
the
warriors
on
seeing
that
myles
and
quivven
had
survived
the
ordeal
of
fire
sheepishly
returned
to
their
posts
and
were
soon
loudly
boasting
of
their
own
bravery
and
of
how
their
fellows
would
envy
them
on
the
morrow
when
they
should
relate
their
experiences
along
toward
morning
cabot
drew
his
first
heat
of
molten
matter
into
a
brick
ladle
and
poured
it
into
the
converter
it
was
an
impressive
sight
the
shadowy
inclosure
lit
by
the
waving
greenish
flare
of
a
pillar
of
fire
which
metamorphosed
the
white
skin
of
the
into
that
of
a
jaundiced
oriental
tinged
quivven
with
and
glinted
off
the
shiny
carapace
of
doggo
as
off
the
facets
of
a
bloodstone
in
the
darkness
of
the
background
toiled
the
workers
at
their
pumps
then
there
came
a
change
the
fires
died
down
the
pumping
ceased
oil
lamps
were
lit
and
the
ghostly
glare
gave
place
to
a
faint
but
healthy
light
although
over
all
hung
the
ominous
silence
of
expectancy
the
ladle
was
brought
up
a
removed
and
out
flowed
a
crimson
liquid
tinting
all
the
eager
surrounding
faces
with
a
sinister
ruddiness
again
the
red
glare
as
the
ladle
was
poured
into
the
converter
then
the
pumps
were
started
again
and
the
blast
from
the
converter
replaced
that
of
the
furnace
with
its
ghostly
light
two
hours
later
the
converter
was
tipped
and
pure
molten
copper
was
poured
out
into
the
ladle
once
more
the
sinister
ruddiness
quickly
the
molds
were
filled
the
red
light
was
gone
the
spell
was
broken
conversation
was
resumed
the
first
metallurgy
of
vairkingi
was
an
accomplished
fact
day
came
and
with
it
loud
pounding
on
the
gate
cabot
answered
it
carelessly
and
abstractedly
sliding
back
the
bolt
before
inquiring
who
was
outside
the
gate
swung
open
with
a
bang
almost
knocking
myles
into
a
flower
bed
and
in
rushed
a
vairking
youth
with
drawn
sword
and
panting
heavily
you
beast
he
cried
lunging
at
the
as
he
spoke
but
in
his
haste
and
anger
he
lunged
too
hard
and
too
far
so
that
cabot
although
unarmed
was
able
to
step
under
his
guard
and
grasp
him
by
the
wrist
before
he
recovered
quick
as
lightning
the
boy
s
sword
arm
was
bent
up
behind
his
back
and
he
was
in
chancery
to
use
the
wrestling
term
slowly
grimly
cabot
forced
the
imprisoned
hand
upward
between
the
of
his
opponent
until
with
a
groan
the
latter
relinquished
the
sword
and
it
fell
clattering
to
the
ground
smiling
cabot
stooped
down
and
picked
it
up
and
forced
the
young
intruder
against
the
wall
now
said
the
explain
the
boy
faced
myles
like
a
cornered
panther
it
s
quivven
he
snarled
you
have
stolen
my
nonsense
myles
exclaimed
what
do
you
mean
i
am
tipi
the
steadfast
the
youth
replied
long
have
i
loved
the
golden
flame
and
she
me
until
you
came
to
this
city
when
you
arrived
i
was
away
on
a
military
expedition
winning
distinctions
to
lay
at
the
tiny
feet
of
my
fair
one
last
night
i
returned
to
find
her
working
at
your
laboratory
one
or
the
other
you
or
i
must
you
are
absurd
in
country
tipi
returned
looking
the
straight
in
the
eye
no
common
soldier
is
permitted
to
dictate
manners
to
a
gentleman
i
repeat
that
but
at
this
point
myles
cuffed
the
young
vairking
over
one
ear
knocking
him
flat
upon
the
walk
and
as
he
scrambled
sputtering
to
his
feet
dealt
him
another
blow
which
sent
him
reeling
into
the
street
then
myles
barred
the
gate
and
turned
toward
the
house
in
the
doorway
stood
quivven
shaking
with
laughter
myles
was
immediately
embarrassed
he
hadn
t
known
that
his
encounter
had
been
observed
he
hated
to
show
off
and
was
afraid
that
his
actions
had
appeared
very
melodramatic
isn
t
tipi
silly
she
asked
but
he
may
make
trouble
with
your
father
myles
said
with
a
worried
frown
oh
i
m
not
afraid
of
but
he
will
put
an
end
to
my
so
quivven
went
home
to
chat
with
her
father
before
young
tipi
could
get
there
to
stir
up
possible
trouble
she
returned
later
in
the
day
to
resume
her
work
while
she
was
gone
cabot
conferred
with
doggo
why
are
you
building
this
radio
set
the
wrote
i
did
not
ask
you
before
in
the
presence
of
the
lady
for
i
felt
that
perhaps
you
did
not
wish
her
to
know
your
doggo
you
show
remarkable
intuition
myles
wrote
in
reply
it
is
true
that
i
do
not
wish
any
of
the
vairkings
to
know
my
idea
is
to
communicate
with
cupia
learn
how
lilla
is
getting
along
and
encourage
my
supporters
there
to
hold
out
until
in
some
way
i
can
secure
a
formian
airship
and
return
across
the
boiling
then
cease
your
work
doggo
wrote
for
my
plane
in
perfect
condition
lies
carefully
hidden
in
a
wood
not
a
full
day
s
journey
from
this
city
all
that
we
need
is
alcohol
for
the
xv
plans
for
escape
we
can
make
the
alcohol
in
a
few
days
in
my
laboratory
cabot
wrote
but
it
will
not
do
for
us
to
escape
too
precipitately
lest
our
plans
be
discovered
and
blocked
the
vairkings
like
and
wish
to
keep
me
with
them
as
their
court
magician
let
us
bide
our
time
until
they
become
sufficiently
accustomed
to
you
so
that
they
will
not
question
your
accompanying
me
on
an
expedition
then
away
to
the
plane
and
off
to
cupia
the
assented
it
seemed
logical
and
yet
i
wonder
if
this
logic
would
not
have
done
credit
to
jud
the
i
wonder
if
cabot
was
not
subconsciously
influenced
by
a
scientific
desire
to
complete
his
radio
set
in
this
land
of
people
who
used
only
wood
and
flint
i
wonder
at
all
events
the
work
proceeded
he
had
planned
to
use
the
slag
from
the
copper
furnace
as
the
ore
for
his
iron
but
the
more
he
thought
about
it
the
more
he
realized
that
its
high
sulphur
content
would
probably
ruin
any
steel
which
he
produced
fortunately
however
he
ran
across
a
deposit
of
magnetic
iron
ore
near
vairkingi
this
he
ground
and
placed
in
his
crucibles
with
charcoal
and
they
built
charcoal
fires
in
the
pits
around
them
the
slag
he
slammed
off
with
the
melting
had
to
be
repeated
many
times
in
order
to
purify
the
iron
sufficiently
and
further
in
order
to
secure
just
the
right
carbon
content
for
steel
or
according
to
which
he
needed
for
any
particular
purpose
this
securing
the
proper
carbon
content
was
largely
a
matter
of
with
iron
and
steel
available
he
now
made
pots
retorts
hammers
anvils
drills
dies
and
a
decent
bessemer
converter
copper
tubes
for
and
copper
wire
were
drawn
a
simple
wooden
lathe
was
made
for
winding
thread
around
the
wires
this
thread
by
the
way
was
the
only
vairkingian
product
which
the
found
ready
to
his
hand
as
soon
as
the
iron
retorts
were
available
the
joint
manufacture
of
sal
ammoniac
and
soda
was
started
as
already
outlined
by
doggo
in
iron
pots
cabot
melted
together
finely
ground
white
sand
with
lime
soda
and
potash
and
blew
the
resulting
glass
into
bottles
retorts
test
tubes
and
other
laboratory
apparatus
also
jars
for
his
electric
batteries
he
used
both
soda
and
potash
as
this
would
render
the
glass
more
fusible
than
if
made
with
either
alone
lead
was
melted
from
galena
crystal
in
small
quantities
for
solder
thus
was
suggested
to
doggo
the
manufacture
on
the
side
of
bullets
gunpowder
and
cartridges
for
the
rifle
which
myles
had
in
his
quarters
and
for
the
one
which
lay
in
the
concealed
airplane
tales
of
the
had
spread
among
the
populace
who
evinced
such
great
interest
that
double
guards
had
to
be
placed
and
maintained
about
the
laboratory
inclosure
and
every
returning
military
expedition
brought
with
it
samples
of
unusual
minerals
meanwhile
cabot
instituted
a
regular
campaign
of
getting
vairkingi
accustomed
to
doggo
every
day
doggo
would
parade
the
streets
with
quivven
the
golden
flame
perched
upon
his
back
the
ant
inspired
great
interest
and
considerable
fear
she
enjoyed
her
rides
thoroughly
not
only
for
the
novelty
of
the
thing
but
also
because
her
seat
on
his
back
brought
her
head
above
the
level
of
the
fence
palings
and
thus
enabled
her
to
survey
the
private
yards
of
everyone
tipi
had
not
been
seen
or
heard
from
arkilu
the
beautiful
thoroughly
made
up
with
the
and
even
admitted
that
her
love
for
him
had
been
a
mistake
plans
for
her
wedding
with
jud
proceeded
rapidly
when
this
coming
marriage
was
publicly
announced
att
the
terrible
sent
in
a
roy
runner
with
the
message
that
he
didn
t
in
the
least
care
quivven
now
lived
in
the
palace
so
as
to
be
near
her
father
but
came
to
work
regularly
each
day
theoph
the
grim
interposed
no
objection
to
this
and
in
fact
frequently
accompanied
his
daughter
to
the
laboratory
he
loved
to
mess
around
the
bottles
and
retorts
and
lost
much
of
the
grimness
when
engaged
in
this
childish
meddlesomeness
so
every
one
was
happy
except
tipi
the
steadfast
and
att
the
terrible
jud
continued
the
operation
of
the
brickyard
even
though
cabot
had
no
more
need
of
bricks
for
jud
planned
to
build
himself
a
brick
palace
which
would
outshine
even
the
palace
of
king
theoph
melting
the
platinum
for
the
wires
presented
a
problem
until
myles
thought
of
electrolizing
some
ordinary
water
into
its
constituent
hydrogen
and
oxygen
and
then
burning
these
two
materials
together
in
a
double
much
like
that
used
in
oxyacetylene
welding
but
to
do
this
he
had
to
make
batteries
to
this
end
he
already
had
sal
ammoniac
and
jars
he
needed
carbon
and
zinc
for
carbon
he
pressed
charcoal
into
compact
blocks
to
extract
zinc
from
the
blend
ore
he
made
long
cylindrical
retorts
of
clay
with
a
long
clay
pipe
for
a
vent
the
ore
after
being
thoroughly
roasted
in
the
furnace
to
remove
all
sulphur
was
ground
mixed
with
half
its
weight
of
powered
charcoal
and
then
charged
into
the
retorts
where
it
was
baked
the
result
was
to
distill
the
pure
zinc
which
condensed
on
the
walls
of
the
tubes
cabot
now
at
last
had
all
the
elements
for
his
batteries
and
so
was
able
by
employing
about
seventy
cells
in
multiple
to
get
the
two
volts
three
hundred
fifty
amperes
necessary
to
electrolize
the
oxygen
and
hydrogen
for
melting
his
platinum
the
platinum
proved
to
be
quite
free
of
iridium
and
so
was
easily
drawn
into
wires
needless
to
state
the
distilling
of
alcohol
in
large
quantities
ostensibly
for
the
laboratory
burners
but
actually
for
doggo
s
airplane
was
commenced
as
soon
as
they
had
blown
their
first
glass
retorts
myles
was
going
strong
one
day
in
the
midst
of
all
this
technical
progress
as
myles
was
passing
through
one
of
the
streets
of
vairkingi
on
some
errand
or
other
and
admiring
the
quaint
and
brightly
colored
wood
carvings
on
the
high
walls
which
lined
the
way
his
attention
was
arrested
by
the
design
over
one
of
the
gateways
it
was
a
crimson
swastika
within
a
crimson
triangle
the
insignia
of
the
priests
of
the
lost
religion
of
cupia
the
priests
who
had
befriended
him
in
their
hidden
refuge
of
the
caves
of
kar
when
he
was
a
fugitive
during
the
dark
days
of
his
second
war
against
the
could
it
be
that
the
lost
religion
was
also
implanted
upon
continent
myles
had
never
discussed
religion
with
arkilu
or
jud
or
quivven
or
crota
or
any
of
his
vairking
friends
somehow
the
subject
had
never
come
up
full
of
curiosity
cabot
knocked
in
the
door
immediately
a
small
round
aperture
opened
and
a
voice
from
within
inquired
whence
come
you
for
reply
the
gave
one
of
the
passwords
of
the
cupian
religion
to
his
surprise
the
gate
swung
open
and
he
was
admitted
into
the
presence
of
a
priest
clad
exactly
like
his
friends
of
the
caves
of
kar
what
do
you
wish
asked
the
guardian
of
the
gate
having
made
his
way
so
far
myles
decided
to
continue
on
the
analogy
of
the
religion
of
his
own
continent
accordingly
he
boldly
replied
i
wish
to
speak
with
the
holy
very
well
said
the
guard
and
closing
the
gate
and
barring
it
he
led
myles
through
many
winding
passages
to
a
door
on
which
he
knocked
three
times
the
knock
was
repeated
from
within
the
door
opened
and
myles
entered
to
gaze
upon
a
strangely
familiar
scene
the
room
was
richly
carved
and
colored
on
three
sides
hung
the
stone
lamps
of
the
vairkings
around
the
walls
sat
a
score
or
more
of
priests
some
on
the
level
and
some
on
slightly
raised
platforms
on
the
highest
platform
of
all
directly
opposite
the
point
where
cabot
had
entered
sat
the
only
hooded
figure
in
the
chamber
quite
evidently
the
leader
of
the
faith
him
the
approached
and
bowed
low
whereat
there
came
the
unexpected
words
welcome
to
vairkingi
myles
then
the
priest
descended
took
the
visitor
by
the
hand
and
led
him
to
a
seat
at
his
own
left
a
few
minutes
later
the
assembly
had
been
temporarily
suspended
and
myles
and
his
host
were
chatting
together
like
old
friends
myles
told
the
venerable
prelate
the
complete
history
of
all
his
adventures
on
both
continents
of
the
planet
poros
not
omitting
to
dwell
with
considerable
detail
upon
the
vicissitudes
of
the
lost
religion
of
cupia
this
interested
the
priest
greatly
and
he
asked
numerous
questions
in
that
connection
strange
strange
he
ruminated
it
is
undoubtedly
the
same
religion
as
ours
so
there
must
at
some
time
have
been
some
connection
between
the
two
yes
there
must
have
been
the
assented
for
the
written
language
of
both
cupia
and
vairkingi
is
the
same
yet
the
totally
different
flora
and
fauna
of
the
two
continents
negatives
this
where
did
the
cupians
originate
if
you
know
the
priest
inquired
we
do
not
know
myles
replied
but
there
are
two
conflicting
legends
one
is
that
the
forerunners
of
the
race
came
from
across
the
boiling
seas
the
other
is
that
they
sprang
fully
formed
from
the
soil
there
is
also
a
legend
that
creatures
like
me
dwell
beyond
the
boiling
seas
and
legend
at
least
appears
to
be
borne
out
by
the
existence
of
your
strange
still
more
strange
the
prelate
declared
for
we
have
but
story
of
origin
the
race
of
vairkings
descended
from
another
world
above
the
skies
who
knows
but
that
we
like
you
came
from
that
place
which
you
call
the
i
think
you
said
after
some
further
conversation
the
conclave
was
called
to
order
again
and
myles
took
this
as
the
signal
for
his
departure
he
was
given
a
warm
invitation
to
return
truly
a
new
avenue
of
speculation
had
been
opened
up
to
him
by
his
chance
meeting
with
the
holy
leader
myles
firmly
resolved
to
return
again
at
the
earliest
opportunity
but
from
this
time
on
events
moved
with
such
rapidity
that
never
again
did
he
enter
the
sacred
precincts
first
he
was
stumped
by
his
radio
tubes
how
was
he
to
make
a
which
would
exhaust
the
air
the
solution
when
it
finally
occurred
to
him
was
absurdly
simple
he
utilized
atmospheric
pressure
he
made
a
glass
tube
thirty
feet
long
and
sealed
his
grid
his
plates
and
his
into
one
end
closing
that
end
off
hermetically
then
he
fashioned
a
piston
of
waterproof
cloth
fiber
so
as
to
fit
into
the
closed
end
almost
touching
these
elements
and
yet
free
to
move
away
from
them
without
tearing
them
then
he
filled
the
tube
with
water
and
inverted
it
but
the
water
did
not
drop
away
to
a
height
of
about
feet
as
it
would
have
done
on
earth
of
course
not
for
this
was
of
an
atmospheric
pressure
practically
equal
to
that
of
earth
holding
the
water
up
and
yet
with
a
gravity
much
less
than
that
of
earth
tending
to
pull
the
water
down
but
by
lengthning
the
pipe
sufficiently
cabot
finally
got
the
proper
balance
the
fiber
piston
was
pulled
down
and
a
partial
vacuum
practically
free
of
had
been
created
he
then
sealed
off
the
upper
portion
of
the
glass
tube
with
his
and
had
his
radio
triad
for
these
radio
tubes
the
glass
was
made
according
to
a
special
formula
of
this
same
glass
cabot
fashioned
lenses
for
the
goggles
which
he
and
doggo
planned
to
wear
on
their
trip
home
across
the
boiling
seas
one
of
the
constituents
of
this
special
glass
is
lead
monoxide
commonly
known
as
litharge
this
gave
the
radio
man
some
concern
until
doggo
suggested
melting
lead
in
a
rotating
cylindrical
iron
drum
with
spiral
ribs
by
pumping
cold
air
in
one
end
of
this
drum
fine
particles
of
litharge
were
driven
out
through
the
other
where
they
accumulated
in
a
stationary
container
about
this
time
the
king
and
jud
began
clamoring
for
results
so
cabot
made
a
few
electric
lights
with
platinum
filaments
and
entirely
apart
from
pacifying
his
two
patrons
it
was
well
that
he
did
this
for
the
speedy
burning
out
of
these
lights
showed
him
that
he
had
a
new
problem
to
face
namely
the
elimination
of
all
traces
of
oxygen
in
his
tubes
he
got
rid
of
considerable
by
placing
tubes
in
a
strong
magnetic
field
while
exhausting
but
this
was
not
quite
enough
it
looked
as
though
his
experiments
would
have
to
end
at
this
point
for
with
an
immense
quantity
of
alcohol
completed
and
with
pyrex
glass
for
their
goggles
everything
was
all
set
for
the
conspirators
to
locate
doggo
s
hidden
plane
and
fly
across
the
boiling
seas
to
cupia
the
vairkings
were
by
now
sufficiently
used
to
the
huge
and
to
his
participation
in
cabot
s
scientific
experiments
so
that
no
objection
would
be
raised
to
his
accompanying
the
radio
man
on
one
of
the
latter
s
expeditions
in
search
of
certain
minerals
which
he
believed
could
be
found
in
the
country
two
carts
laden
with
tents
food
and
bedding
were
taken
along
and
beneath
these
supplies
he
placed
the
alcohol
and
goggles
there
was
no
need
to
conceal
them
for
none
of
the
vairkings
except
quivven
ever
had
any
very
distinct
knowledge
of
what
he
was
about
and
to
her
he
explained
that
the
alcohol
was
for
the
purpose
of
loosening
certain
materials
from
the
solid
rocks
and
that
the
goggles
were
to
protect
his
and
doggo
s
eyes
from
the
fumes
a
squad
of
soldiers
pulled
the
carts
doggo
had
demurred
at
this
suggesting
that
the
soldiers
be
left
behind
and
offering
to
pull
them
himself
but
myles
pointed
out
how
easily
he
could
scatter
the
vairkings
when
the
time
came
by
threatening
them
with
his
magic
rifle
early
in
the
morning
they
set
forth
just
as
the
unseen
rising
sun
began
to
tint
the
eastern
sky
with
purple
when
the
time
came
to
say
farewell
to
quivven
myles
found
to
his
surprise
that
his
voice
was
positively
choked
with
emotion
golden
flame
he
said
please
wish
me
a
safe
of
course
i
do
she
said
but
why
so
sad
you
sound
as
though
you
never
expected
to
see
me
one
never
can
tell
he
replied
your
food
has
disagreed
with
you
she
bantered
i
feel
confident
that
you
will
return
for
have
you
not
often
quoted
to
me
they
can
not
kill
a
minorian
run
along
now
and
come
back
thus
he
left
her
a
smile
on
her
face
and
a
tear
in
his
eye
he
hated
to
deceive
quivven
who
had
been
a
good
little
pal
in
spite
of
her
occasional
of
temper
he
looked
back
and
waved
to
her
where
she
stood
like
a
golden
statue
upon
the
city
wall
it
would
be
his
last
glimpse
of
a
true
friend
then
he
set
his
face
resolutely
to
the
eastward
not
only
did
he
feel
a
pang
at
leaving
quivven
but
he
felt
even
more
of
a
pang
at
leaving
his
half
finished
the
scientist
always
predominated
in
his
makeup
and
besides
like
the
good
workman
that
he
was
he
hated
an
unfinished
job
but
he
realized
that
his
radio
project
had
been
only
a
means
to
an
end
being
to
get
in
touch
with
his
friends
and
family
in
that
this
end
was
about
to
be
accomplished
more
directly
just
think
night
he
would
be
home
ready
to
do
battle
for
his
loved
ones
against
the
usurper
yuri
the
thought
thrilled
him
and
all
regrets
passed
away
lilla
he
was
to
see
his
beautiful
dainty
lilla
once
more
and
his
baby
son
kew
rightful
ruler
of
cupia
he
resolved
that
once
back
with
them
again
he
would
never
more
leave
them
lilla
had
been
right
his
return
to
earth
had
been
a
foolhardy
venture
results
had
proved
it
as
poblath
the
cupian
philosopher
used
to
say
the
test
of
a
plan
is
how
it
works
cabot
was
eager
even
impatient
to
see
the
which
was
to
carry
him
home
he
was
bubbling
over
with
questions
to
ask
his
companion
the
condition
of
the
plane
its
exact
location
how
well
it
had
been
concealed
and
so
forth
but
his
only
means
of
communication
with
doggo
was
in
writing
and
it
would
never
do
to
delay
the
expedition
for
the
purpose
of
indulging
in
a
written
conversation
so
he
merely
fretted
and
fumed
and
urged
the
vairking
pullers
of
the
carts
to
greater
speed
but
along
toward
evening
a
calm
settled
over
him
a
joyous
calm
he
was
going
home
going
home
the
words
sang
in
his
ears
he
was
going
to
cupia
to
baby
kew
and
princess
lilla
a
nervous
warmth
flooded
through
his
being
and
tingled
at
his
fingertips
he
felt
the
strength
to
overcome
any
obstacles
which
might
confront
him
he
was
going
home
just
before
sunset
the
party
encamped
on
the
outskirts
of
a
small
grove
of
trees
which
doggo
indicated
as
the
of
his
plane
and
other
supplies
it
had
already
been
agreed
that
they
should
not
inspect
the
machine
before
morning
for
they
did
not
wish
to
give
even
the
slow
brains
of
vairking
soldiers
a
chance
to
figure
out
their
ulterior
purpose
and
perhaps
to
dispatch
a
runner
to
vairkingi
with
a
warning
to
theoph
and
jud
so
myles
was
forced
to
possess
his
soul
in
patience
and
await
the
dawn
to
keep
his
mind
off
his
troubles
he
sat
with
the
furry
warriors
about
their
camp
fire
and
told
them
tales
of
cupia
and
the
planet
earth
never
before
in
their
experience
had
this
strange
furless
leader
of
theirs
been
so
graciously
condescending
or
so
sociable
it
was
an
evening
which
they
would
long
remember
finally
they
all
turned
in
for
the
night
the
slept
fitfully
and
dreamed
of
encounters
in
which
with
his
back
to
the
wall
he
fought
with
a
wooden
sword
alone
against
prince
yuri
and
and
vairkings
and
cupians
and
whistling
bees
in
defense
of
lilla
and
her
son
yet
such
is
the
strange
alchemy
of
dreams
that
sometimes
lilla
s
face
seemed
to
be
covered
with
golden
fur
with
the
first
red
flush
of
morning
cabot
and
doggo
bestirred
themselves
and
informed
their
campmates
that
they
intended
to
do
a
bit
of
prospecting
before
breakfast
then
they
set
out
into
the
interior
of
the
wood
the
leading
the
way
at
last
they
came
to
a
small
clearing
and
beyond
it
a
thicket
which
doggo
indicated
with
one
paw
as
being
the
spot
which
they
sought
there
was
to
be
the
plane
parting
the
foliage
they
looked
inside
but
the
thicket
was
empty
on
the
farther
side
the
bushes
had
been
recently
chopped
down
and
thence
there
lay
a
wide
swath
of
cut
trees
clear
out
of
the
woods
it
was
only
too
evident
that
the
precious
plane
had
been
stolen
xvi
afterthoughts
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
it
doggo
s
plane
was
gone
and
with
it
had
vanished
all
hopes
of
a
speedy
return
to
cupia
sadly
the
two
returned
to
camp
and
gave
directions
to
start
back
to
vairkingi
but
myles
cabot
was
not
a
man
to
despair
or
he
would
have
yielded
to
fate
many
times
in
the
past
during
his
radio
adventures
on
the
silver
planet
already
as
the
porters
were
loading
the
carts
his
agile
mind
was
busy
seeking
some
way
whereby
to
snatch
victory
from
defeat
so
when
the
expedition
was
ready
to
start
he
led
it
around
the
woods
until
he
picked
up
the
trail
of
the
stolen
airship
quite
evidently
the
theft
had
not
been
made
by
for
they
would
have
the
machine
away
upon
clearing
the
woods
no
it
had
obviously
been
taken
by
either
roies
or
vairkings
who
had
wheeled
or
dragged
it
away
if
he
and
doggo
could
follow
its
path
they
might
yet
be
able
to
locate
and
recover
the
stolen
property
the
trail
led
north
until
it
struck
at
right
angles
a
broad
and
road
which
ran
from
vairkingi
to
the
northeast
territory
of
the
vairkings
and
at
this
point
the
trail
completely
vanished
myles
held
a
written
conference
with
doggo
at
which
it
was
decided
to
return
at
once
to
the
city
and
make
inquiries
there
as
to
the
stolen
plane
if
no
one
there
knew
of
it
doggo
was
to
be
dispatched
on
a
new
expedition
into
the
northeast
territory
and
in
the
meantime
cabot
was
to
rush
the
completion
of
his
radio
set
so
they
turned
to
the
left
and
took
up
the
march
to
vairkingi
it
was
a
tired
and
disgusted
human
who
returned
that
evening
to
the
quarters
which
he
had
never
expected
to
set
eyes
on
again
myles
cabot
gave
himself
up
to
a
few
moments
of
unrestrained
grief
as
he
sat
thus
a
soft
sympathetic
voice
said
didn
t
you
succeed
in
finding
that
which
you
sought
i
am
so
sorry
at
least
you
came
back
safely
to
but
the
blandishments
of
little
quivven
his
pal
failed
to
comfort
him
that
evening
when
jud
returned
from
the
brickyard
myles
sought
an
audience
with
him
and
demanded
news
of
the
plane
said
myles
this
beast
friend
of
mine
came
near
here
in
a
magic
wagon
which
travels
through
the
air
possession
of
this
magic
wagon
would
mean
much
to
vairkingi
in
your
wars
and
especially
if
the
beasts
ever
take
it
into
their
heads
to
attack
you
as
they
undoubtedly
will
do
sooner
or
later
yesterday
doggo
and
i
embarked
on
a
secret
expedition
to
bring
this
magic
wagon
as
a
surprise
to
you
and
theoph
but
we
find
that
it
has
been
stolen
we
have
traced
it
to
the
northeast
road
and
there
the
trail
ends
it
must
be
either
in
this
city
or
in
the
northeast
territory
will
you
help
me
to
find
it
but
jud
smiled
a
crafty
smile
and
said
it
is
not
in
that
i
am
certain
nor
will
i
send
into
the
northeast
territory
to
find
it
for
you
for
i
well
know
that
you
would
use
it
to
return
to
your
own
land
beyond
the
boiling
seas
we
wish
you
to
stay
with
us
and
do
wonders
for
us
we
believe
that
we
can
make
your
lot
among
us
a
happy
one
but
remember
that
although
you
are
treated
with
great
honors
you
are
nevertheless
still
my
slave
any
attempt
on
your
part
to
locate
the
magic
wagon
will
be
met
with
severe
punishment
and
an
end
will
be
put
to
your
experiments
i
have
myles
cabot
met
the
other
s
eye
squarely
you
have
spoken
jud
he
said
myles
was
now
convinced
that
jud
knew
more
about
the
missing
plane
than
he
was
willing
to
admit
so
the
only
thing
to
do
was
to
lie
low
bide
his
time
keep
an
ear
out
for
news
of
the
plane
and
continue
the
manufacture
of
the
radio
set
thus
the
ruminated
as
he
walked
slowly
back
to
his
quarters
and
then
the
linking
of
radio
and
airplanes
in
his
mind
gave
him
an
idea
he
had
felt
all
along
that
he
was
doing
the
correct
thing
in
building
a
radio
set
rather
than
in
manufacturing
firearms
with
which
to
attack
the
formians
or
in
trying
to
fabricate
an
airplane
for
a
flight
across
the
boiling
seas
his
intuition
had
been
correct
his
subconscious
mind
must
have
guided
him
to
make
the
radio
order
to
phone
cupia
for
a
plane
to
come
over
to
vairkingi
and
get
why
hadn
t
he
realized
this
before
it
gave
him
new
heart
with
a
laugh
he
reflected
that
this
afterthought
was
pretty
much
like
those
so
characteristic
of
the
man
whom
he
had
just
left
jud
the
always
bungling
and
always
with
a
perfectly
good
excuse
or
alibi
thought
up
afterward
to
explain
why
he
did
something
which
when
he
did
it
was
absolutely
pointless
myles
had
always
looked
down
on
the
vairking
noble
because
of
this
failing
but
now
what
he
found
himself
going
through
exactly
the
same
mental
processes
he
began
to
wonder
if
perhaps
jud
were
not
guided
by
a
fairly
intuition
perhaps
jud
s
afterthoughts
and
excuses
were
but
the
breaking
through
of
a
realization
of
some
real
forethoughts
on
the
part
of
jud
s
subconscious
mind
myles
wondered
he
was
still
wondering
when
he
fell
asleep
that
night
the
next
morning
he
plunged
into
his
work
with
renewed
vigor
he
now
had
copper
wire
copper
plates
wood
mica
solder
platinum
glass
and
that
he
needed
for
his
radio
set
except
a
better
vacuum
for
his
tubes
but
without
that
he
was
as
far
from
success
as
when
he
started
of
course
he
knew
what
he
but
it
was
one
thing
to
step
into
a
drug
store
on
the
earth
or
into
a
chemical
laboratory
in
cupia
and
take
magnesium
off
the
shelves
and
quite
another
matter
to
pick
this
elusive
element
out
of
thin
air
in
vairkingi
nevertheless
in
spite
of
this
lack
myles
kept
on
working
he
wound
his
inductances
transformers
earphones
and
rheostats
he
assembled
his
variable
condensers
and
microphones
he
fashioned
his
sockets
and
lamp
bases
he
strung
his
antennae
he
wired
up
his
baseboard
and
panel
small
sets
were
installed
in
quivven
s
rooms
at
the
palace
at
jud
s
house
and
at
the
brickyard
each
of
these
was
equipped
with
a
for
doggo
s
antennae
as
well
as
with
mouthpieces
for
the
others
so
that
now
at
last
oral
conversation
was
possible
with
his
formian
friend
later
he
would
prepare
a
portable
such
as
he
had
worn
in
cupia
laboratory
experiments
demonstrated
the
success
of
his
sets
in
everything
except
durability
of
tubes
yet
in
spite
of
this
drawback
he
was
able
to
communicate
across
his
laboratory
and
even
with
jud
s
house
and
under
favorable
conditions
with
quivven
at
the
palace
by
using
a
hookup
but
this
was
not
powerful
enough
to
send
as
far
as
the
brickyard
let
alone
cupia
at
this
juncture
there
appeared
one
morning
at
his
gate
a
vairking
soldier
in
leather
tunic
and
helmet
requesting
entrance
with
important
secret
news
myles
grudgingly
left
his
and
gave
audience
the
fellow
had
a
strangely
familiar
appearance
and
smiled
in
a
quizzical
manner
yet
myles
could
not
place
him
who
are
you
myles
asked
do
you
not
know
me
the
other
asked
in
reply
the
soldier
doffed
his
leather
cap
do
you
know
me
now
a
life
for
a
life
now
i
know
you
cabot
exclaimed
you
are
otto
the
bold
son
of
grod
the
silent
who
is
king
of
the
roies
to
paraphrase
one
of
the
proverbs
of
my
own
country
a
face
that
is
familiar
in
sur
is
oft
a
stranger
in
i
did
not
recognize
you
away
from
the
surroundings
in
which
we
met
what
good
fortune
brings
you
here
not
fortune
but
the
roy
replied
it
is
true
that
grod
my
father
is
our
king
but
it
is
also
true
that
att
the
terrible
likewise
claims
the
kingship
att
loves
arkilu
and
is
even
at
this
moment
on
the
march
against
vairkingi
with
the
largest
army
of
roies
ever
myles
smiled
we
are
grateful
for
the
information
he
said
with
this
forewarning
we
are
secure
against
if
you
will
pardon
me
otto
continued
i
think
that
you
are
secure
for
one
of
your
own
vairkings
tipi
by
name
marches
with
att
att
has
promised
tipi
the
glorious
golden
quivven
in
return
for
tipi
s
support
and
tipi
has
many
partisans
within
this
myles
continued
to
smile
we
can
deal
with
traitors
he
asserted
smugly
there
are
many
in
our
but
otto
kept
on
sur
has
what
the
shouted
at
last
shocked
out
of
his
complacency
the
impregnable
fortress
of
sur
fallen
impossible
not
impossible
to
those
who
travel
through
the
skies
and
drop
black
stones
which
fly
to
pieces
with
a
loud
noise
otto
calmly
replied
the
beasts
of
the
south
have
made
alliance
with
att
the
terrible
and
tipi
the
steadfast
and
are
marching
with
them
good
builder
they
are
upon
us
even
now
quick
the
beasts
enter
this
very
room
come
draw
defend
yourself
wheeling
quickly
cabot
confronted
doggo
standing
in
the
doorway
much
relieved
he
explained
to
otto
who
this
newcomer
was
then
seizing
a
pad
and
a
lead
stylus
of
his
own
manufacture
he
hurriedly
sketched
the
situation
to
his
formian
friend
in
reply
doggo
wrote
at
last
i
have
magnesium
ore
some
soldiers
brought
it
in
attracted
by
its
pretty
red
color
there
is
no
time
to
be
lost
to
the
laboratory
you
must
complete
our
set
and
summon
aid
from
cupia
meanwhile
i
will
get
jud
on
the
air
and
call
him
here
for
a
conference
we
have
no
time
to
wait
upon
him
or
even
theoph
in
this
myles
read
the
message
aloud
to
otto
it
is
well
the
latter
commented
now
if
you
will
excuse
me
i
must
be
running
along
my
disguise
as
a
vairking
soldier
will
get
me
safely
out
of
your
city
and
i
must
join
my
father
who
is
planning
to
if
a
fit
opportunity
presents
itself
till
we
meet
till
we
meet
again
in
this
life
or
beyond
the
waves
the
replied
and
may
the
builder
bless
you
for
your
help
this
then
he
rushed
to
the
laboratory
doggo
was
already
tuning
the
set
jud
is
not
at
home
he
wrote
shall
i
waste
a
tube
on
the
brickyard
no
myles
signified
with
a
shake
of
his
head
then
seizing
the
pad
and
stylus
again
he
wrote
i
will
try
and
get
jud
you
meanwhile
attempt
to
extract
magnesium
from
this
piece
of
the
knew
exactly
how
to
proceed
grinding
the
ore
he
mixed
it
with
salt
and
melted
the
mass
in
an
iron
pot
which
he
connected
electrically
with
the
carbon
terminal
of
a
line
of
electric
batteries
in
the
boiling
pot
he
placed
a
copper
plate
connected
with
the
zinc
elements
of
his
cells
by
the
time
the
returned
from
calling
jud
on
the
radio
a
coating
of
pure
magnesium
had
begun
to
form
on
the
copper
anode
an
hour
or
so
later
he
scraped
off
his
first
yield
of
the
precious
metal
the
final
necessity
of
his
projected
radio
set
at
this
stage
jud
appeared
pardon
the
delay
he
started
to
explain
you
see
but
myles
cut
him
short
with
never
mind
explanations
now
it
is
enough
that
you
are
here
sur
has
fallen
the
beasts
of
the
south
and
att
the
terrible
are
on
the
warpath
they
seek
to
rob
you
of
your
arkilu
with
their
aerial
wagons
they
will
drop
magic
rocks
upon
this
city
and
destroy
it
give
doggo
back
his
plane
and
he
will
try
to
combat
but
jud
shook
his
head
you
would
merely
escape
he
replied
and
then
we
would
be
worse
off
than
then
you
admit
that
you
know
the
whereabouts
of
doggo
s
plane
myles
eagerly
asked
not
at
all
not
at
all
the
vairking
suavely
replied
i
was
merely
stating
that
even
if
i
knew
where
this
plane
as
you
call
it
for
builder
s
sake
man
cabot
cut
in
this
is
no
time
to
quibble
over
words
give
us
the
plane
if
you
would
save
theoph
yourself
and
it
s
hardly
necessary
jud
asserted
unruffled
don
t
get
so
excited
if
att
wants
arkilu
he
certainly
won
t
drop
things
on
the
palace
and
we
can
defend
the
palace
against
all
the
roies
in
but
not
against
magic
slingshots
replied
the
perhaps
not
the
noble
said
with
a
crafty
smile
but
we
shall
see
now
i
go
to
prepare
the
defense
you
are
at
liberty
to
come
with
us
if
you
will
or
putter
around
your
tubes
if
you
had
rather
shift
for
yourselves
then
myles
shouted
after
him
and
frantically
resumed
his
work
his
attempt
to
get
the
plane
by
stratagem
had
failed
perhaps
jud
did
not
know
anything
about
the
plane
after
all
it
would
be
typical
of
him
myles
had
plenty
of
sets
of
grids
plates
and
filaments
all
prepared
also
plenty
of
long
tubes
of
pyrex
glass
all
that
remained
necessary
was
to
coat
the
platinum
elements
with
magnesium
fuse
them
into
the
tube
exhaust
the
air
by
the
water
method
as
before
seal
the
tube
and
his
radio
set
would
be
complete
where
is
quivven
he
wrote
to
doggo
she
ought
to
be
here
helping
with
on
her
way
from
the
palace
the
replied
i
her
presently
she
entered
and
jauntily
inquired
what
all
the
excitement
was
about
myles
explained
as
briefly
as
possible
her
only
answer
was
to
shrug
her
golden
shoulders
and
remark
tipi
is
a
little
fool
he
can
have
me
if
he
can
get
then
she
took
her
seat
at
the
workbench
after
a
while
she
inquired
why
the
rush
with
the
radio
set
when
vairkingi
is
in
peril
myles
replied
our
only
hope
now
is
to
get
cupia
on
the
air
and
persuade
my
followers
there
to
send
across
the
boiling
seas
enough
aerial
wagons
to
defeat
the
beasts
of
the
south
or
formians
as
we
call
and
will
you
talk
with
your
lilla
she
asked
innocently
yes
if
the
builder
wills
he
eagerly
and
reverently
replied
to
his
surprise
quivven
jumped
to
her
feet
with
flashing
eyes
and
seizing
a
small
iron
anvil
from
the
workbench
she
held
it
over
the
precious
pile
of
platinum
elements
and
if
i
drop
this
anvil
you
will
talk
to
her
is
not
that
so
myles
horrified
sat
rooted
to
his
seat
unable
to
move
xvii
the
battle
for
vairkingi
but
the
flaming
quivven
did
not
drop
the
anvil
on
the
precious
tube
elements
instead
she
flung
it
from
her
to
the
floor
and
sank
limply
into
her
seat
her
golden
head
on
her
arms
on
the
workbench
i
couldn
t
do
it
she
moaned
between
sobs
for
i
too
know
what
it
is
to
love
talk
to
her
myles
and
i
will
help
he
gasped
with
relief
you
wouldn
t
spoil
all
our
days
and
days
of
labor
i
am
sure
he
said
what
was
the
matter
i
don
t
understand
wouldn
t
was
her
reply
as
she
shook
herself
together
and
resumed
work
after
a
while
one
of
the
soldiers
attached
to
the
laboratory
brought
in
word
that
the
roies
and
formians
were
attacking
the
walls
and
that
planes
were
sailing
around
in
the
sky
overhead
cabot
gave
word
to
mass
his
men
to
defend
the
laboratory
at
all
costs
and
went
on
working
one
by
one
the
tubes
were
completed
and
tested
from
time
to
time
quivven
would
step
into
the
yard
glance
at
the
sky
and
then
report
back
to
myles
the
formian
planes
were
scouting
low
but
were
not
dropping
bombs
jud
had
apparently
been
right
in
one
the
beasts
would
not
risk
injuring
the
expected
prizes
of
war
namely
arkilu
and
quivven
from
time
to
time
runners
brought
word
of
the
fighting
at
the
outer
wall
of
the
city
it
would
have
been
an
easy
matter
for
the
to
bomb
the
gates
and
thus
let
in
their
roy
allies
but
evidently
they
were
playing
safe
even
there
at
last
however
word
came
that
friends
of
opened
one
of
the
gates
and
that
the
enemy
was
now
within
the
city
still
myles
worked
steadily
on
suddenly
quivven
returned
from
one
of
her
scouting
trips
in
the
yard
with
the
cry
one
of
the
air
wagons
has
seen
me
and
is
coming
down
at
that
the
radio
man
permitted
himself
to
leave
his
bench
for
a
few
moments
and
go
to
the
door
true
the
plane
was
hovering
down
eagerly
awaited
by
a
score
or
so
of
cabot
s
vairking
soldiers
armed
with
swords
spears
and
bows
as
the
formians
came
within
bowshot
they
were
met
with
a
shower
of
arrows
most
of
which
however
glanced
harmlessly
off
the
metallic
bottom
of
the
fuselage
the
at
once
retaliated
with
a
shower
of
bullets
two
vairkings
dropped
to
the
ground
and
the
others
frantically
rushed
to
cover
within
the
buildings
forcing
back
myles
and
his
two
companions
as
the
fugitives
crowded
through
the
door
where
is
magic
slingshot
one
of
them
taunted
him
as
they
swept
by
the
shook
himself
and
passed
the
back
of
one
hand
across
his
tired
brow
then
hurried
to
his
living
room
seizing
his
rifle
he
cautiously
approached
one
of
the
slit
windows
which
overlooked
the
yard
and
peeked
out
the
plane
was
on
the
ground
four
ants
were
disembarking
here
at
last
was
a
chance
to
secure
transportation
myles
opened
fire
the
formians
were
taken
completely
by
surprise
oh
how
it
did
cabot
s
heart
good
to
see
those
ancient
enemies
drop
and
squirm
as
he
pumped
lead
into
them
they
made
no
attempt
to
return
his
fire
but
scuttled
toward
their
beached
plane
only
one
of
them
reached
it
but
one
was
enough
to
deprive
the
of
his
booty
up
shot
the
craft
followed
by
a
parting
bullet
from
myles
then
he
proceeded
to
the
yard
once
more
his
furry
soldiers
brave
now
that
all
danger
was
over
were
already
there
before
him
putting
an
end
to
the
three
wounded
with
swords
and
spears
a
strong
and
pungent
odor
filled
the
air
myles
sniffed
it
was
alcohol
in
large
quantities
the
plane
could
not
last
long
for
he
had
punctured
its
fuel
tank
each
of
the
dead
enemies
had
been
fully
armed
so
that
although
myles
failed
in
his
plan
to
secure
the
airship
the
encounter
had
at
least
netted
him
three
rifles
and
three
bandoleers
of
cartridges
these
he
bestowed
on
doggo
quivven
and
the
captain
of
his
guards
saying
you
three
with
four
or
five
others
had
better
go
at
once
to
jud
s
compound
before
the
fighting
reaches
here
for
now
that
the
formians
have
located
quivven
they
are
sure
to
attack
again
sooner
or
but
the
princess
remonstrated
with
him
let
us
stay
together
fight
together
and
if
need
be
die
for
the
builder
s
sake
run
along
he
replied
testily
we
are
wasting
valuable
time
i
will
join
you
if
the
fighting
gets
too
thick
but
how
can
you
by
the
back
way
which
you
taught
but
you
need
the
help
of
doggo
and
no
longer
for
the
set
is
complete
all
that
remains
to
be
done
is
to
tune
in
and
either
get
cupia
on
the
air
or
not
now
as
you
are
my
true
friends
please
run
along
so
with
a
shrug
and
a
pout
she
left
him
and
with
her
went
doggo
and
the
captain
and
five
of
the
guard
much
relieved
the
radio
man
returned
to
his
workbench
although
the
move
truly
was
wise
for
the
safety
of
quivven
the
real
motive
which
actuated
myles
was
a
desire
to
have
her
absent
when
and
if
he
should
talk
to
his
lilla
he
leaned
his
rifle
against
the
bench
hung
the
bandoleer
handily
near
by
and
set
to
work
a
few
more
connections
and
his
hookup
was
complete
he
surveyed
the
assembled
set
with
a
great
deal
of
satisfaction
for
although
it
really
was
a
means
to
an
end
yet
it
was
a
considerable
end
in
itself
after
all
as
any
radio
fan
can
appreciate
once
more
myles
standish
cabot
electrical
engineer
had
demonstrated
his
premiership
on
two
worlds
he
had
made
a
complete
radio
set
out
of
basic
natural
elements
without
the
assistance
of
a
single
previously
fabricated
tool
or
material
it
was
an
unbelievable
feat
yet
it
had
been
completed
successfully
with
trembling
hands
he
adjusted
the
controls
and
listened
gradually
he
tuned
in
a
station
it
seemed
a
nearby
station
a
voice
was
saying
we
could
not
report
before
o
master
for
we
have
only
just
repaired
the
set
which
this
cabot
wrecked
the
minorian
lied
when
he
told
you
that
he
had
affairs
well
in
hand
for
even
at
that
moment
he
was
a
fugitive
he
is
now
with
the
furry
cupians
who
live
to
the
north
of
new
formia
today
our
forces
are
attacking
their
city
it
is
only
a
matter
of
a
few
parths
before
he
will
be
in
our
hands
i
have
spoken
and
shall
now
stand
by
to
this
was
the
supreme
test
could
myles
cabot
hear
the
reply
adjusting
his
set
to
the
extreme
limit
of
its
sensitivity
he
waited
his
hands
on
the
dials
faintly
but
distinctly
came
the
answer
in
the
voice
of
yuri
the
usurper
you
have
done
well
now
i
will
hand
the
to
the
princess
lilla
and
i
wish
you
to
repeat
to
her
what
you
have
just
told
me
so
that
she
may
hear
it
with
her
own
antennae
and
a
pause
and
then
cabot
heard
the
stationed
at
the
shack
on
the
mountains
near

disappearing
of
the
formian

with
att
the
terrible
of
the
fall
of
sur
and
of
the
attack
on
vairkingi
ending
with
the
words
which
he
had
already
caught
as
he
listened
to
this
narration
the
was
rapidly
making
up
his
mind
what
to
do
and
as
soon
as
the
signed
off
cabot
cut
in
with
lilla
dearest
do
not
show
any
sign
of
surprise
but
listen
intently
as
though
the
formian
were
still
speaking
this
is
your
own
myles
i
am
sending
from
a
station
which
i
have
only
just
completed
after
many
sangths
of
intensive
work
it
is
true
that
the
formians
are
now
attacking
our
city
but
they
can
not
win
sur
fell
because
we
were
taken
by
surprise
but
we
were
warned
in
time
to
defend
vairkingi
already
i
myself
have
driven
off
one
plane
and
killed
three
formians
as
yet
i
have
been
unable
to
secure
an
airship
or
i
should
have
flown
back
to
you
please
get
in
touch
with
toron
or
some
other
of
my
friends
and
persuade
them
to
fly
across
the
boiling
seas
and
bring
me
back
yuri
has
made
it
twice
and
what
man
has
done
that
can
man
now
i
am
about
to
finish
when
i
sign
off
please
request
yuri
for
permission
to
talk
to
the
formian
at
yuriana
to
ask
him
some
questions
then
tell
me
as
much
as
you
can
of
yourself
our
baby
and
the
situation
in
cupia
before
yuri
shuts
you
off
i
have
spoken
and
myles
stood
by
to
receive
with
what
a
thrill
did
he
hear
his
own
lilla
s
voice
answer
oh
formian
i
have
prince
yuri
s
permission
to
speak
to
you
you
may
answer
what
i
ask
you
and
reply
to
what
i
tell
you
but
he
himself
will
receive
lest
i
hear
something
which
i
ought
not
this
leads
me
to
believe
that
affairs
are
not
so
bad
with
cabot
as
you
she
is
doing
fine
myles
remarked
to
himself
admiringly
so
far
yuri
will
not
suspect
that
she
is
talking
to
lilla
s
voice
continued
you
and
the
other
formians
may
be
interested
to
know
that
prince
yuri
is
in
complete
control
here
baby
kew
and
i
are
well
and
are
being
respectfully
treated
by
prince
yuri
as
his
guests
in
the
palace
at
kuana
he
has
promised
me
that
if
i
will
marry
him
kew
can
have
the
succession
after
his
death
and
this
i
might
have
accepted
for
the
baby
s
sake
but
now
that
i
know
that
you
still
live
this
can
not
she
has
made
a
slip
cabot
moaned
evidently
she
realized
it
herself
for
her
voice
hurried
on
you
see
the
whistling
then
yuri
s
voice
cut
in
abruptly
with
congratulations
cabot
i
don
t
see
how
you
did
it
your
would
have
gotten
across
a
lot
more
information
to
you
if
she
hadn
t
inadvertently
let
me
know
to
whom
she
was
talking
by
her
careless
use
of
the
word
you
i
don
t
know
what
you
said
to
her
but
i
shall
be
on
my
guard
no
more
radio
for
the
princess
lilla
until
my
henchmen
in
new
formia
report
your
death
which
i
hope
will
be
soon
you
cursed
spot
of
sunshine
yuri
king
of
cupia
signing
off
for
the
so
that
was
that
myles
switched
off
the
set
and
sat
submerged
in
thought
lilla
and
his
baby
were
safe
he
doubted
not
that
she
would
sooner
or
later
find
means
to
send
him
a
plane
he
had
given
yuri
cause
to
doubt
the
glorious
story
told
by
the
formian
radio
operator
the
new
set
had
fulfilled
its
mission
but
how
had
yuri
succeeded
in
climbing
into
power
again
in
cupia
of
the
inhabitants
of
which
were
loyal
to
princess
lilla
and
the
baby
king
then
myles
remembered
her
closing
words
the
whistling
it
was
as
little
jacqueline
farley
had
prophesied
on
her
father
s
new
england
farm
during
cabot
s
brief
revisit
to
the
earth
cabot
had
stated
there
can
be
no
peace
on
any
continent
which
is
inhabited
by
more
than
one
race
of
intelligent
beings
whereat
little
jacqueline
had
pointed
out
that
the
whistling
bees
were
intelligent
beings
doubtless
yuri
had
stirred
up
trouble
between
the
bees
and
their
cupian
allies
and
had
ridden
to
the
throne
on
the
crest
of
this
trouble
portheris
king
of
the
bees
had
undoubtedly
been
deposed
for
he
was
too
loyal
to
myles
to
stand
for
this
the
s
reverie
was
rudely
interrupted
at
this
point
by
one
of
his
soldiers
who
rushed
into
the
laboratory
shouting
sir
there
is
fighting
in
your
very
yard
cabot
slipped
the
bandoleer
over
his
shoulders
adjusted
the
straps
picked
up
his
rifle
and
hurried
to
the
door
in
the
yard
his
guards
were
struggling
in
combat
with
a
superior
force
of
roies
he
could
tell
them
apart
not
only
by
the
contrast
between
the
fine
features
of
his
own
men
and
apelike
faces
of
the
intruders
but
more
easily
by
the
contrast
between
the
leather
tunics
of
the
vairkings
and
the
nakedness
of
the
roies
so
standing
calmly
in
the
doorway
myles
began
picking
off
the
enemy
one
by
one
with
his
rifle
it
was
too
easy
almost
like
but
it
didn
t
last
long
for
the
roies
soon
learned
what
was
up
and
breaking
away
from
their
opponents
crowded
out
through
the
gate
followed
by
a
shower
of
missiles
and
maledictions
cabot
s
vairkings
were
for
following
but
their
master
peremptorily
called
them
back
and
directed
them
to
barricade
the
laboratory
it
was
well
that
he
did
so
for
presently
the
heads
of
the
enemy
began
to
appear
above
the
top
of
the
fence
evidently
they
had
built
a
platform
in
the
street
soon
arrows
and
pebbles
began
to
fly
at
the
windows
of
the
house
the
vairkings
replied
with
a
volley
but
cabot
cautioned
them
to
conserve
their
ammunition
and
watch
him
pick
off
with
his
rifle
one
by
one
the
heads
which
showed
themselves
above
the
paling
this
soon
ceased
to
be
interesting
so
giving
the
rifle
and
bandoleer
to
one
of
the
more
intelligent
of
his
men
and
instructing
them
to
hold
the
laboratory
at
all
costs
the
set
out
sword
in
hand
by
the
back
way
to
rejoin
doggo
and
quivven
the
alleys
which
he
threaded
were
deserted
he
reached
the
rear
of
jud
s
compound
without
event
and
passed
in
to
one
of
the
inclosures
through
a
small
and
well
concealed
gate
in
the
face
of
the
wall
quivven
had
pointed
this
route
out
to
him
before
but
never
had
he
traversed
it
farther
than
this
point
he
looked
cautiously
around
him
then
he
rubbed
his
eyes
and
looked
again
he
could
hardly
believe
his
senses
there
stood
a
formian
airplane
in
apparently
perfect
condition
approaching
it
gingerly
with
drawn
sword
he
circled
it
carefully
to
make
sure
that
it
contained
no
enemies
but
it
was
deserted
a
hasty
inspection
disclosed
that
everything
was
in
working
order
except
that
the
fuel
tank
was
empty
probably
then
this
was
the
plane
at
which
he
had
fired
but
no
for
this
plane
did
not
even
of
alcohol
the
tank
had
evidently
been
dry
for
some
time
and
there
was
no
sign
of
any
bullet
hole
in
it
gradually
the
fact
dawned
on
him
that
this
was
doggo
s
plane
which
jud
had
concealed
from
them
for
so
long
he
must
reach
doggo
and
tell
him
at
the
farther
side
of
the
inclosure
from
the
side
at
which
he
had
entered
there
was
a
door
myles
raced
toward
it
and
flung
it
open
beyond
it
there
was
a
second
inclosure
similar
to
the
first
myles
raced
across
this
one
as
well
and
flung
open
another
door
whereupon
out
poured
a
crowd
of
roies
upsetting
him
and
throwing
him
sprawling
upon
the
ground
but
they
were
as
surprised
as
he
was
at
the
encounter
and
this
fact
enabled
him
to
regain
his
sword
and
scramble
to
his
feet
before
they
were
upon
him
again
with
parry
and
thrust
good
swordsman
as
he
was
they
had
soon
forced
him
his
back
against
the
wall
to
defend
his
life
with
his
trusty
wooden
blade
time
and
again
one
of
their
points
would
reach
his
tunic
but
he
kept
his
neck
well
guarded
and
so
was
able
to
stand
them
off
when
he
had
drawn
his
breath
and
got
his
bearings
and
his
defense
had
become
slightly
a
matter
of
routine
he
recognized
the
leader
of
the
enemy
as
none
other
than
the
traitor
tipi
his
first
thought
was
to
run
tipi
through
for
his
treachery
but
then
he
reflected
that
quite
likely
quivven
really
loved
tipi
after
all
it
would
be
a
shame
to
kill
this
boy
merely
because
his
unrequited
love
had
caused
him
to
lose
his
head
from
then
on
myles
had
no
time
to
reflect
on
anything
for
he
was
engaged
in
the
difficult
task
of
trying
to
defend
himself
without
hurting
tipi
the
young
vairking
had
recognized
the
and
was
hurling
vituperations
at
him
but
myles
saved
his
breath
for
his
even
so
he
gradually
tired
his
sword
hand
no
longer
instantly
responded
to
every
command
of
his
agile
brain
and
even
his
brain
itself
became
less
agile
it
was
only
a
matter
of
time
when
he
would
be
certain
to
make
a
misplay
and
go
down
before
his
opponents
yet
still
he
struggled
on
and
then
suddenly
a
new
complication
entered
the
game
for
he
was
seized
from
behind
the
arms
and
was
lifted
struggling
and
kicking
off
the
ground
xviii
the
fall
of
vairkingi
as
miles
was
lifted
from
the
ground
by
the
unknown
force
behind
which
had
seized
him
beneath
the
armpits
his
roy
opponents
fell
back
away
from
him
in
surprise
but
immediately
their
expressions
changed
to
intense
pleasure
quite
evidently
they
regarded
this
mysterious
new
power
as
an
ally
myles
could
not
squirm
around
to
see
what
was
holding
him
so
still
grasping
his
sword
in
his
right
hand
he
felt
with
his
left
hand
under
his
right
armpit
and
found
claw
of
a
formian
in
another
moment
he
would
be
within
reach
of
its
horrid
jaws
and
then
would
came
the
paralyzing
bite
which
he
knew
so
well
from
past
experience
nevertheless
he
could
die
fighting
shifting
his
sword
quickly
so
that
he
held
it
point
upward
he
struck
backward
with
it
across
his
shoulder
and
had
the
satisfaction
of
hearing
and
feeling
it
glint
on
the
carapace
of
his
captor
a
few
more
strokes
and
by
lucky
chance
his
blade
might
find
a
joint
in
the
black
shell
of
the
but
just
as
he
was
about
to
strike
again
a
familiar
voice
behind
him
called
out
stop
myles
for
builder
s
sake
stop
it
is
doggo
who
holds
you
and
is
rescuing
you
from
your
it
was
the
voice
of
quivven
tipi
and
the
roies
instantly
understood
and
made
a
rush
at
their
late
victim
but
they
were
too
late
for
doggo
had
lifted
the
safely
over
the
wall
there
stood
quivven
and
the
members
of
their
guard
quick
doggo
the
rifles
myles
shouted
your
missing
plane
is
in
the
next
inclosure
we
must
reach
it
before
the
enemy
of
course
this
was
all
lost
on
the
of
the
formian
but
the
other
members
of
the
party
acted
at
once
on
their
side
of
the
wall
there
was
a
platform
near
the
top
springing
lightly
onto
this
the
furry
maid
and
the
captain
of
the
guard
covered
the
roies
with
their
rifles
you
exclaimed
tipi
in
surprise
what
did
you
expect
quivven
taunted
you
attacked
this
city
in
search
of
me
here
i
am
you
can
have
me
if
you
can
catch
me
but
you
had
better
not
try
it
just
now
for
i
and
my
friends
have
these
magic
which
can
kill
at
almost
any
distance
go
quickly
before
i
try
it
on
you
for
old
times
sake
go
but
tipi
and
his
roies
stood
steadfast
the
captain
and
quivven
fired
two
roies
dropped
and
the
others
fled
precipitately
out
through
the
gates
by
which
they
entered
tipi
the
steadfast
was
left
alone
confronting
cabot
and
his
companions
but
he
never
budged
over
the
fence
vaulted
the
five
vairking
guardsmen
in
their
leather
armor
and
attacked
their
renegade
countryman
who
being
a
noble
wore
only
a
leather
helmet
the
unequal
contest
could
have
but
one
result
yet
quivven
looked
on
complacently
at
the
impending
downfall
of
her
former
sweetheart
cabot
however
had
more
heart
running
along
the
platform
within
the
wall
he
vaulted
over
at
a
point
distant
from
the
contest
sneaked
steadily
up
on
tipi
and
suddenly
throttled
him
from
behind
at
the
same
time
shouting
to
his
own
henchmen
to
desist
the
five
vairkings
obediently
dropped
their
swords
and
then
trussed
up
the
young
noble
with
his
own
leather
belt
and
by
placing
him
in
a
sitting
posture
tying
his
ankles
together
slipping
a
piece
of
stick
beneath
his
knees
placing
his
elbows
under
the
ends
of
this
stick
and
tying
his
wrists
together
in
front
of
his
shins
also
they
gagged
him
and
thus
they
left
the
traitor
rolled
ignominiously
into
a
corner
his
eyes
blazing
with
a
piteous
hate
meanwhile
doggo
exploring
the
exits
had
seen
his
plane
he
returned
to
the
group
bristling
with
excitement
and
made
signs
to
them
to
follow
him
out
of
respect
for
his
joy
none
of
the
party
let
on
that
cabot
had
been
the
first
to
find
the
airship
and
had
already
informed
them
of
it
so
they
followed
doggo
and
gave
every
indication
of
being
much
impressed
with
loving
touch
the
huge
black
caressed
each
strut
and
brace
and
guy
and
joint
and
lever
as
he
made
a
thorough
inspection
of
his
craft
all
appeared
to
be
in
perfect
condition
even
the
bombs
the
rifle
and
the
ammunition
were
intact
from
somewhere
in
the
interior
of
the
fusilage
doggo
produced
a
pad
of
paper
and
a
formian
stylus
and
wrote
alcohol
we
must
have
alcohol
then
away
from
these
accursed
shores
seizing
the
writing
materials
myles
replied
you
have
four
rifles
let
me
take
one
of
them
protect
this
plane
with
the
other
three
while
i
return
alone
by
the
back
way
and
bring
the
alcohol
here
under
convoy
of
the
entire
laboratory
then
giving
no
time
for
dissent
he
seized
the
rifle
and
bandoleer
from
the
plane
and
was
gone
out
through
the
next
inclosure
he
went
slid
open
the
secret
door
in
the
wall
and
peered
cautiously
out
one
lone
with
rifle
and
bandoleer
was
parading
the
alley
myles
fired
but
missed
the
formian
promptly
took
cover
behind
a
pile
of
rubbish
and
fired
back
myles
hastily
withdrew
then
cautiously
put
his
head
through
the
opening
again
in
order
to
take
a
shot
at
his
enemy
but
the
enemy
fired
first
the
bullet
grazing
the
leather
helmet
of
the
and
stunning
him
considerably
so
he
sat
on
the
ground
within
the
inclosure
and
rubbed
his
sore
head
for
a
few
minutes
what
a
narrow
escape
then
he
had
an
idea
he
propped
his
hat
on
a
stick
so
that
it
would
sway
gently
in
the
breeze
its
rim
just
projecting
through
the
opening
in
the
wall
giving
every
indication
of
life
then
he
ran
quickly
along
inside
the
wall
until
he
came
to
a
corner
which
he
judged
must
be
about
opposite
the
rubbish
heap
which
sheltered
the
formian
climbing
quietly
up
the
studding
at
this
point
he
peered
carefully
over
there
lay
his
black
enemy
only
a
few
feet
away
steadily
watching
the
bobbing
edge
of
the
helmet
two
shots
from
cabot
s
rifle
and
the
vigil
was
over
and
soon
the
his
helmet
regained
and
with
an
extra
rifle
and
cartridge
belt
flung
across
his
shoulders
was
proceeding
unmolested
down
the
alley
he
reached
the
laboratory
without
further
adventure
and
found
everything
as
he
had
left
it
the
guard
however
reported
that
they
had
had
to
repulse
three
assaults
by
roies
the
last
of
which
had
been
led
by
a
formian
armed
with
a
rifle
if
it
had
not
been
for
this
magic
which
you
left
with
us
said
the
guardsman
we
should
have
been
beaten
but
the
surprise
of
the
savage
ones
at
finding
us
thus
armed
was
so
great
that
even
their
leader
could
not
rally
them
though
the
beast
did
kill
several
of
our
men
before
he
finally
fled
with
his
roy
the
radio
man
then
informed
them
of
his
intention
to
cart
the
alcohol
to
jud
s
inclosure
where
new
wonders
would
be
performed
accordingly
all
except
a
few
sentinels
withdrew
into
the
laboratory
to
load
up
first
myles
sorted
out
the
bottles
which
were
small
enough
to
carry
conveniently
and
then
filled
these
bottles
with
alcohol
from
the
large
carboys
in
which
it
was
stored
this
left
a
dozen
or
so
carboys
still
unemptied
it
would
be
a
pity
to
leave
these
behind
but
it
would
be
impossible
to
get
a
cart
out
by
the
back
way
so
the
radio
man
gave
hasty
directions
to
take
an
empty
cart
through
his
front
gate
under
guard
and
attempt
to
get
it
around
by
the
various
winding
streets
into
the
alley
without
its
being
captured
by
the
enemy
meanwhile
all
the
alcohol
was
moved
to
the
alley
gate
and
heavily
guarded
there
while
this
was
being
done
myles
cabot
took
a
few
minutes
time
for
a
farewell
glance
around
his
laboratory
which
he
was
about
to
quit
for
the
last
time
he
had
enjoyed
working
here
for
there
is
no
human
pleasure
greater
than
the
joy
of
accomplishment
and
here
he
had
accomplished
the
almost
superhuman
task
of
building
up
a
complete
sending
and
receiving
radio
set
out
of
its
basic
elements
even
though
he
was
at
last
about
to
journey
home
to
his
lilla
and
his
baby
son
in
cupia
he
hated
to
leave
this
precious
set
an
irresistible
impulse
drew
him
to
it
as
a
loadstone
draws
a
magnet
he
placed
his
fingers
on
the
controls
he
tuned
to
the
same
wave
length
in
which
he
had
talked
and
received
earlier
in
the
day
a
voice
was
speaking
in
the
language
of
formia
and
cupia
vairkingi
is
about
to
fall
o
master
and
with
it
the
minorian
must
certainly
get
into
our
hands
for
our
scout
fliers
are
circling
the
outer
walls
to
the
city
to
prevent
his
so
that
was
why
the
ant
planes
hadn
t
bothered
them
recently
but
o
master
the
voice
of
the
continued
i
have
bad
news
to
report
along
with
the
good
for
while
practically
our
entire
populace
was
engaged
with
the
hordes
of
our
ally
att
the
terrible
in
besieging
vairkingi
other
hordes
of
furry
savages
under
grod
the
silent
have
attacked
and
captured
our
own
city
of
yuriana
and
with
it
have
seized
our
reserve
planes
and
supplies
of
ammunition
i
but
before
the
formian
could
complete
his
signing
off
myles
slammed
over
the
leaf
switch
and
cut
in
with
cabot
speaking
cabot
speaking
know
then
o
yuri
that
vairkingi
will
not
fall
my
arms
are
victorious
here
as
at
your
ant
city
of
yuriana
presently
you
will
cease
to
receive
any
further
messages
from
either
here
or
your
own
mountain
station
and
then
you
will
know
that
the
last
of
your
formians
has
perished
off
the
face
of
this
continent
soon
you
may
expect
me
and
my
furry
allies
to
fly
across
the
boiling
seas
to
redeem
cupia
but
of
our
coming
we
shall
give
you
no
further
warning
tremble
and
await
us
meanwhile
believe
none
of
the
stories
which
your
henchmen
will
falsely
send
you
to
keep
up
your
courage
answer
me
now
and
tell
me
that
you
have
received
my
message
i
have
then
he
set
the
switches
to
receive
back
came
the
answer
but
it
was
from
the
mountain
station
to
the
south
and
it
came
from
prince
yuri
in
cupia
it
is
a
lie
the
minorian
of
course
it
was
a
lie
but
it
was
war
and
yuri
would
not
know
which
version
to
credit
if
anything
should
happen
to
the
sending
set
near
the
city
of
the
ants
yuri
certainly
would
believe
the
worst
from
that
time
on
cabot
smiled
to
himself
the
formian
continued
denying
and
explaining
and
apologizing
finally
he
signed
off
and
then
prince
yuri
got
on
the
air
listen
o
formian
he
said
and
you
o
cabot
i
received
both
of
your
messages
naturally
i
believe
my
own
man
call
me
again
when
you
have
something
further
to
report
i
have
he
may
believe
his
own
henchman
cabot
muttered
to
himself
but
later
he
will
begin
to
then
shutting
off
his
set
he
penned
a
hurried
note
in
duplicate
to
otto
the
bold
congratulations
on
the
capture
of
the
city
of
the
black
beasts
destroy
their
hut
in
the
mountains
where
you
first
shot
arrows
at
me
and
first
saw
me
use
the
magic
slingshot
destroy
it
at
all
costs
for
with
it
ends
the
power
of
the
beasts
cabot
the
minorian
one
copy
he
gave
to
each
of
two
of
the
most
trusted
of
his
laboratory
guards
and
adjured
them
at
all
costs
to
break
through
the
lines
separately
and
get
the
message
to
the
prince
of
the
friendly
faction
of
the
roies
if
either
of
my
vairkings
succeeds
in
reaching
prince
otto
myles
said
to
himself
it
will
mean
the
end
of
yuri
s
reports
from
this
then
with
a
sigh
the
radio
man
picked
up
an
iron
mallet
and
demolished
his
own
radio
set
the
work
of
so
many
hours
of
care
when
he
had
finished
there
was
not
a
fragment
left
intact
this
too
must
pass
he
quoted
sadly
at
this
point
one
of
his
vairkings
rushed
in
upon
him
with
a
shout
a
party
of
roies
is
attacking
the
alley
shaking
himself
together
the
radio
man
bade
farewell
to
his
beloved
laboratory
picked
up
his
two
rifles
and
his
ammunition
and
hastened
to
take
command
of
his
forces
he
found
that
his
cart
had
safely
got
around
to
the
gate
but
that
a
conflict
for
its
possession
was
now
in
progress
between
the
guard
and
a
large
force
of
roies
so
were
the
contestants
that
the
leader
of
the
vairkings
had
not
dared
to
use
the
rifle
cabot
however
had
the
confidence
of
greater
experience
a
few
well
placed
shots
fired
by
him
from
the
gate
and
the
enemy
broke
away
and
retreated
down
the
alley
myles
handed
out
one
of
his
own
two
rifles
thus
raising
the
number
of
his
riflemen
to
two
these
with
several
bowmen
took
cover
down
the
alley
to
hold
off
any
by
the
enemy
the
carboys
of
alcohol
were
then
quickly
loaded
into
the
cart
along
with
all
the
reserve
ammunition
which
doggo
had
manufactured
and
the
expedition
set
forth
cabot
with
his
rifle
in
the
lead
the
other
two
riflemen
and
the
archers
forming
a
rear
guard
closely
followed
by
the
hostile
band
of
roies
but
in
spite
of
this
pursuit
all
went
well
until
the
party
turned
into
the
alley
of
the
secret
door
to
jud
s
enclosure
here
they
found
the
way
blocked
by
a
formidable
body
of
the
furry
savages
led
by
half
a
dozen
armed
with
rifles
luckily
there
was
plenty
of
rubbish
in
the
alley
behind
which
to
take
cover
from
those
ahead
those
behind
were
not
much
of
a
problem
not
having
any
firearms
other
than
bows
and
arrows
but
it
was
aggravating
to
be
stopped
within
sight
of
one
s
goal
furthermore
three
of
the
ants
promptly
departed
doubtless
for
the
purpose
either
of
bringing
up
reenforcements
or
of
joining
the
roies
who
were
on
the
other
side
of
cabot
s
party
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
the
rifles
were
now
three
to
three
accordingly
the
called
his
archers
from
the
rear
and
ordered
a
charge
of
course
his
porters
could
not
fight
while
carrying
a
bottle
of
alcohol
under
each
arm
so
all
the
bottles
were
piled
around
the
cart
and
left
with
a
small
guard
the
attack
proved
temporarily
successful
step
by
step
the
three
ants
and
their
roy
allies
were
driven
back
but
just
as
cabot
and
his
vairkings
were
about
to
gain
the
secret
opening
in
the
wall
word
was
brought
that
the
roies
in
the
rear
were
attacking
the
cart
so
cabot
had
to
order
a
speedy
retreat
to
save
his
precious
alcohol
thus
giving
up
in
an
instant
the
ground
which
it
had
taken
so
long
to
gain
the
roies
were
readily
repulsed
from
the
cart
and
retreated
down
the
alley
in
disorder
but
the
party
with
whom
cabot
and
his
vairkings
had
just
been
fighting
formed
at
once
for
a
at
this
juncture
a
row
of
heads
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
appeared
over
the
top
of
the
wall
quivven
the
golden
flame
doggo
the
and
six
vairking
guardsmen
quivven
and
two
guardsmen
held
rifles
with
which
they
promptly
covered
the
approaches
to
the
alley
while
doggo
started
hurling
airplane
bombs
into
the
group
of
roies
led
by
his
three
countrymen
when
the
smoke
cleared
the
alley
was
cleared
as
well
here
and
there
were
arms
and
legs
and
other
anatomical
sections
of
roies
and
formians
all
the
survivors
had
fled
myles
picked
up
two
ant
rifles
and
the
twisted
remains
of
a
third
and
hurriedly
passed
what
was
left
of
his
precious
liquid
fuel
in
through
the
little
gate
in
the
wall
nearly
half
the
bottles
and
carboys
had
been
broken
during
the
fighting
the
vairking
dead
numbered
about
a
dozen
with
several
more
wounded
these
were
brought
within
the
inclosure
and
ministered
to
by
quivven
by
this
time
the
pink
twilight
had
begun
to
settle
over
the
planet
poros
departure
that
day
was
now
out
of
the
question
accordingly
guards
were
posted
and
the
rest
of
the
party
prepared
to
spend
the
night
close
to
the
plane
on
tapestries
filched
from
the
palace
of
jud
the
the
radio
man
himself
was
nearly
exhausted
having
worked
steadily
for
hours
on
the
completion
of
his
set
and
the
subsequent
fighting
yet
before
he
turned
in
he
inquired
about
the
state
of
the
battle
it
appeared
that
little
was
known
save
that
the
city
was
overrun
by
and
the
furry
savages
of
att
the
terrible
and
that
isolated
groups
of
vairkings
were
defending
as
best
they
could
their
respective
inclosures
against
the
invaders
cabot
reported
the
capture
of
the
ant
city
by
grod
the
silent
which
news
served
to
hearten
his
own
little
band
considerably
the
mention
of
the
radio
set
whereby
he
had
obtained
this
information
suggested
to
him
to
ask
have
you
tried
to
get
the
palace
of
theoph
the
grim
with
the
small
set
in
jud
s
quarters
yes
quivven
replied
repeatedly
but
no
one
answers
you
see
the
palace
set
is
in
my
own
rooms
and
it
has
probably
not
occurred
to
anyone
to
go
then
they
lay
down
for
a
fitful
night
of
shouts
and
shots
and
flares
but
no
one
attacked
the
inclosure
which
they
occupied
along
toward
morning
the
fell
into
a
soundless
sleep
only
to
be
awakened
by
one
of
his
vairking
soldiers
shaking
him
roughly
by
the
shoulders
awake
the
warrior
shouted
awake
vairkingi
is
in
flames
the
fire
is
rapidly
eating
its
way
toward
it
was
true
all
around
them
was
the
uncanny
red
of
the
conflagration
overhead
there
sped
flocks
of
sparks
against
a
background
of
billowy
clouds
of
smoke
and
a
further
background
of
sky
immediate
steps
were
necessary
to
protect
their
airship
from
the
flying
embers
accordingly
the
bottles
and
carboys
of
alcohol
were
emptied
into
the
fuel
tank
of
the
craft
and
then
filled
with
water
brooms
of
brush
were
brought
and
used
to
beat
out
such
sparks
as
endangered
the
plane
doggo
tested
the
motors
and
found
them
in
good
order
the
tapestries
were
loaded
on
board
then
there
remained
nothing
they
could
do
except
keep
watch
guard
the
plane
and
await
the
dawn
although
of
course
if
the
holocaust
should
approach
too
near
it
would
become
necessary
for
them
to
fly
night
or
no
night
meanwhile
it
occurred
to
myles
to
try
once
more
to
get
the
palace
on
the
air
so
with
rifle
and
ammunition
slung
over
his
shoulders
and
carrying
a
torch
he
proceeded
to
jud
s
quarters
on
the
way
he
espied
a
dark
form
crouching
in
a
corner
of
the
fence
of
one
of
the
inclosures
xix
the
battle
in
the
air
cabot
unslung
his
rifle
held
his
torch
high
above
him
and
approached
the
crouching
figure
the
crouching
figure
groaned
it
was
tipi
still
trussed
up
forgotten
by
all
myles
cut
his
bonds
and
helped
him
to
his
feet
but
he
collapsed
again
with
a
groan
so
leaving
him
lying
there
the
hastened
back
to
the
plane
and
then
returned
with
one
of
his
vairkings
whom
he
instructed
to
take
charge
of
the
young
noble
until
he
was
able
to
walk
and
then
turn
him
loose
through
the
secret
gate
into
the
alley
there
was
no
point
in
leaving
even
an
enemy
to
be
burned
to
death
trussed
up
in
a
corner
tipi
attended
to
myles
proceeded
to
jud
s
quarters
where
he
tuned
in
the
palace
the
result
was
immediate
jud
speaking
said
a
voice
answer
cabot
for
builder
s
sake
answer
cabot
speaking
he
replied
i
am
at
your
quarters
o
jud
with
me
are
quivven
doggo
and
about
two
dozen
of
the
laboratory
guards
we
have
eight
magic
slingshots
now
and
also
the
magic
aerial
wagon
which
you
have
so
long
concealed
from
me
as
soon
as
day
breaks
we
shall
rise
in
the
air
and
do
battle
with
the
beasts
if
you
had
let
me
have
this
wagon
before
i
could
have
prevented
the
fall
of
vairkingi
now
it
may
be
too
late
how
are
things
with
you
back
came
the
answer
theoph
the
grim
arkilu
the
beautiful
and
i
are
safe
in
the
palace
with
most
of
the
army
of
the
vairkings
so
far
we
have
repulsed
every
assault
of
the
beasts
and
their
roy
allies
but
their
magic
slingshots
do
frightful
havoc
come
and
rescue
us
o
to
which
cabot
replied
with
daylight
i
shall
as
he
came
out
of
the
house
he
looked
up
at
the
sky
the
background
against
which
swirled
the
smoke
clouds
now
showed
faintly
purple
by
the
time
he
rejoined
his
party
by
the
plane
day
had
come
and
it
was
well
for
the
buildings
in
the
next
inclosure
had
started
to
burn
cabot
gave
his
parting
instructions
to
the
captain
of
the
guard

of
these
eight
rifles
convoy

princess

to
her
father
s
but
am
i
not
going
with
you
she
interrupted
in
surprise
i
am
afraid
not
my
dear
myles
sadly
replied
you
have
been
a
good
little
pal
and
i
hate
to
leave
you
but
you
would
be
entirely
out
of
place
among
the
cupians
besides
there
is
every
chance
of
our
perishing
in
crossing
the
boiling
then
you
are
going
home
she
wailed
you
are
planning
to
desert
us
in
our
extremity
no
he
answered
i
shall
first
fight
the
and
do
all
that
i
can
to
save
vairkingi
when
i
am
done
you
will
be
safer
here
than
you
would
be
with
but
she
sank
to
the
ground
by
his
side
and
buried
her
head
on
her
arms
sobbing
myles
myles
i
love
you
can
t
you
see
that
i
loved
you
all
this
time
oh

so
blind

with
you
your
quivven
your
own
little
golden
the
sternly
put
her
in
the
care
of
one
of
the
guards
saying
grimly
this
makes
it
more
impossible
for
you
to
go
with
me
quivven
for
i
have
a
wife
and
child
in
that
other
land
across
the
seas
i
am
sorry
sorrier
than
i
can
say
that
you
have
come
to
love
me
can
t
you
see
quivven
that
this
effectually
seals
the
question
if
it
had
not
been
for
this
i
might
have
yielded
to
your
entreaties
but
now
it
is
then
to
the
captain
of
the
guards
with
these
six
rifles
march
to
the
palace
and
join
the
forces
of
theoph
and
jud
i
will
endeavor
to
destroy
as
many
of
the
beasts
as
possible
before
i
finally
leave
you
and
depart
for
my
own
country
start
at
once
leaving
only
two
or
three
of
your
number
to
help
so
the
guard
marched
away
dragging
a
reproachful
and
quivven
with
them
three
vairkings
remained
and
these
shortly
were
joined
by
a
fourth
cabot
half
consciously
noticed
this
new
arrival
but
paid
little
attention
in
the
bustle
of
his
preparations
the
tapestries
which
were
to
serve
in
place
of
fur
to
swathe
himself
and
doggo
in
their
flight
across
the
boiling
seas
were
rearranged
so
as
to
take
up
less
room
the
goggles
which
he
had
brought
from
the
laboratory
were
packed
with
them
the
bombs
and
rifle
ammunition
were
placed
in
handy
positions
a
small
quantity
of
provisions
were
added
everything
was
lashed
down
then
myles
drew
doggo
to
one
side
for
a
conference
and
wrote
i
plan
first
to
attack
those
formians
and
roies
who
are
besieging
theoph
s
palace
then
to
dispose
of
as
many
as
possible
of
the
scout
planes
how
many
of
these
are
there
we
had
seven
airships
in
our
city
in
the
south
wrote
doggo
in
reply
this
is
one
of
them
here
one
is
probably
temporarily
disabled
by
the
shots
which
you
fired
in
the
laboratory
yard
that
should
leave
can
we
fight
five
most
assuredly
doggo
wrote
agitating
his
antennae
eagerly
then
let
s
go
wrote
cabot
with
a
quick
diagonally
down
the
inclosure
the
huge
bombing
plane
rose
slowly
into
the
air
amid
shouts
from
the
vairking
soldiers
below
it
was
now
broad
daylight
myles
glanced
over
the
rail
and
noted
that
there
were
now
only
three
warriors
he
vaguely
wondered
what
had
become
of
the
fourth
but
it
was
too
late
to
inquire
up
through
the
swirling
sparks
and
smoke
they
rose
up
up
until
they
could
get
a
bird
view
of
the
whole
city
of
vairkingi
there
on
a
slight
eminence
in
the
center
stood
the
palace
and
inclosures
of
the
king
its
walls
manned
by
vairking
warriors
surrounded
by
savage
besiegers
the
flames
had
not
yet
reached
that
part
of
the
city
and
with
a
change
in
the
wind
appeared
to
be
sweeping
past
it
as
myles
and
doggo
circled
the
palace
they
noted
that
practically
all
the
within
sight
were
massing
in
a
side
street
evidently
preparing
for
an
assault
how
convenient
myles
took
the
levers
and
swooped
low
while
doggo
deluged
his
fellow
countrymen
with
bombs
when
their
sudden
attack
was
over
fully
half
of
the
formian
menace
to
the
city
had
been
wiped
out
now
for
the
scout
planes
these
five
in
number
could
be
seen
circling
the
outskirts
of
the
city
the
two
friends
were
able
to
approach
one
of
these
without
being
suspected
of
being
an
enemy
before
its
flyers
realized
the
peril
it
had
gone
down
in
flames
from
one
bomb
the
other
four
scout
planes
at
once
realized
that
their
own
countryman
doggo
had
returned
to
do
them
battle
and
accordingly
converged
upon
him
again
the
two
friends
exchanged
places
and
then
there
took
place
one
of
the
finest
examples
of
aerial
warfare
which
the
had
ever
witnessed
this
was
not
like
the
battles
with
the
whistling
bees
before
the
advent
of
rifles
on
the
planet
poros
when
the
fighting
tail
of
the
plane
was
pitted
against
the
sting
of
the
bee
for
now
it
was
rifle
against
rifle
bomb
against
bomb
one
by
one
the
enemy
planes
crashed
to
the
ground
as
doggo
spiraled
looped
tailspun
and
at
last
there
was
only
one
formian
opponent
left
doggo
maneuvered
to
a
position
just
above
it
and
cabot
reached
for
a
bomb
to
give
it
the
de
but
the
bombs
were
all
gone
and
the
in
the
plane
below
were
raising
their
rifles
watching
for
a
good
opening
what
was
to
be
done
with
doggo
s
deafness
to
sound
waves
it
would
be
impossible
to
explain
the
situation
to
him
in
time
for
him
to
veer
away
he
naturally
assumed
that
as
he
maneuvered
the
ship
into
this
position
of
advantage
cabot
would
at
once
put
an
end
to
the
fight
in
this
extremity
the
suddenly
thought
of
the
obsolete
fighting
tail
its
levers
were
there
was
it
still
in
operation
he
would
see
grasping
its
levers
he
manipulated
them
swiftly
and
drove
the
tip
of
the
tail
through
the
fuel
tank
of
the
enemy
two
bullets
zipped
by
him
then
the
machine
below
careened
and
soared
to
rather
by
a
stream
of
shots
from
the
s
rifle
the
battle
was
over
cabot
relieved
doggo
at
the
controls
and
circled
the
palace
once
more
his
own
squad
of
laboratory
guards
were
just
entering
one
of
the
palace
gates
the
captain
waved
to
him
but
he
noted
that
quivven
was
not
among
them
poor
girl
what
could
have
become
of
the
poor
little
golden
creature
but
there
was
no
time
to
ask
with
so
many
of
the
ants
killed
all
their
aircraft
disabled
and
the
vairkings
firmly
entrenched
in
the
palace
and
supplied
with
at
least
six
quivven
s
people
were
in
as
good
a
position
as
possible
for
cabot
to
stop
now
might
mean
not
only
renewed
complications
with
the
golden
maid
but
also
possibly
the
confiscation
of
his
plane
by
jud
it
would
not
pay
to
take
any
chances
he
must
hasten
home
to
lilla
leaving
the
ants
the
roies
and
the
vairkings
to
contend
for
the
possession
of
the
burning
city
as
he
turned
the
nose
of
the
airship
upward
and
began
the
ascent
preparatory
to
flying
across
the
western
mountains
to
the
sea
he
observed
a
large
marching
body
of
troops
far
to
the
south
these
might
change
his
responsibility
with
respect
to
his
late
hosts
it
would
only
take
a
few
minutes
to
investigate
so
southward
he
turned
the
plane
the
marching
troops
were
roies
as
he
judged
by
their
absence
of
leather
armor
swooping
low
he
picked
out
the
face
of
their
leader
it
was
otto
the
bold
son
of
grod
the
silent
the
leader
of
the
friendly
faction
of
the
furry
of
the
hills
having
captured
and
sacked
the
city
of
the
ants
they
were
now
evidently
on
their
way
to
relieve
vairkingi
the
last
feeling
of
obligation
passed
from
the
as
waving
to
his
savage
friend
he
turned
the
nose
of
his
plane
upward
once
more
then
it
occurred
to
him
that
having
flown
so
far
south
he
might
just
as
well
take
a
final
look
at
the
besides
this
would
place
him
in
exactly
the
location
where
the
had
landed
when
they
flew
east
across
the
boiling
seas
from
cupia
to
found
new
formia
and
thus
would
be
a
good
point
for
him
to
take
off
in
his
flight
westward
accordingly
he
turned
to
the
right
until
he
topped
the
mountain
range
then
turned
to
the
left
again
and
followed
the
range
southward
but
a
tropical
thunderstorm
forced
him
to
descend
in
a
cleft
of
hills
myles
hoped
that
this
rain
extended
to
vairkingi
and
would
serve
to
quench
its
fires
after
several
hours
the
weather
cleared
once
more
the
two
companions
compared
notes
on
the
adventures
which
had
befallen
them
since
their
first
that
morning
then
they
embarked
once
more
and
continued
their
course
southward
soon
they
passed
over
the
smoking
ruins
of
the
sur
and
at
last
came
to
the
little
radio
hut
of
the
formians
this
too
was
in
ruins
otto
had
received
his
note
wireless
communication
between
cupia
and
vairkingia
and
new
formia
was
at
an
end
yuri
would
now
believe
the
worst
that
cabot
had
told
him
over
the
air
and
that
worst
was
likely
to
prove
to
be
the
truth
after
all
swinging
to
the
westward
myles
passed
over
the
deserted
city
of
the
ants
patrolled
by
a
handful
of
otto
s
roies
and
thence
on
and
on
until
there
loomed
before
him
a
solid
wall
of
steam
it
was
the
boiling
sea
over
which
he
must
pass
in
order
to
rejoin
his
loved
ones
hovering
gently
down
on
a
little
meadow
about
five
miles
inland
the
two
fugitives
prepared
for
the
trip
first
they
pulled
off
some
of
the
tapestries
to
pad
the
fuel
tank
and
there
before
them
lay
a
figure
in
leather
vairking
armor
a
golden
figure
smiling
up
at
them
little
quivven
whom
they
thought
they
had
left
behind
you
myles
exclaimed
scowling
yes
she
replied
i
usually
accomplish
what
i
set
out
to
do
when
you
sent
me
away
i
persuaded
one
of
the
guards
to
lend
me
his
suit
then
i
returned
helped
with
the
loading
and
hid
myself
while
you
and
doggo
were
writing
notes
to
each
other
but
i
nearly
died
of
fright
when
you
were
turning
me
over
and
over
up
there
in
the
myles
sighed
resignedly
i
can
t
send
you
back
now
he
said
though
what
i
shall
do
with
you
in
cupia
the
builders
only
knows
so
the
three
friends
completed
the
preparations
and
then
sat
down
together
for
a
meal
it
was
too
late
to
start
their
flight
that
day
and
besides
a
rest
would
do
them
all
good
so
they
encamped
for
the
remainder
of
the
afternoon
and
the
night
the
next
morning
as
the
first
faint
flush
of
pink
tinged
the
eastern
sky
they
took
their
farewell
meal
on
vairkingian
soil
then
swathed
in
tapestries
and
with
goggles
in
place
they
took
their
stations
in
the
plane
and
headed
straight
for
the
bank
of
steam
as
they
passed
within
its
clouds
all
sight
was
blotted
out
they
had
decked
the
fusilage
over
like
an
eskimo
kayack
only
cabot
s
head
protruding
within
doggo
manipulated
the
levers
and
watched
the
altimeter
and
by
the
light
of
a
vairking
stone
lamp
strange
mingling
of
modernity
and
archaism
cabot
s
vigil
was
for
the
purpose
of
guarding
against
flying
too
high
and
thus
piercing
the
cloud
envelope
and
exposing
them
to
the
fatal
glare
of
the
sun
on
and
on
they
went
cabot
could
see
nothing
the
hot
vapor
condensed
on
his
wrappings
seeped
through
and
scalded
his
head
and
shoulders
unbearably
finally
he
could
stand
it
no
longer
he
pulled
in
his
head
and
tore
off
the
bandages
the
relief
was
instantaneous
he
seized
the
levers
and
doggo
took
his
place
at
the
opening
but
at
last
even
doggo
succumbed
having
braved
the
heat
too
long
he
collapsed
weakly
on
the
floor
of
the
cockpit
it
s
my
turn
quivven
shouted
above
the
noise
of
the
motors
now
aren
t
you
glad
you
brought
me
along
and
in
spite
of
cabot
s
remonstrances
she
swathed
her
golden
head
and
stuck
it
through
the
opening
by
this
time
scalding
water
was
leaking
through
all
the
covering
of
the
cockpit
it
was
only
a
question
of
minutes
before
it
would
soak
through
the
of
those
within
but
just
then
the
girl
cried
out
land
land
once
more
and
clear
silver
doggo
revived
and
tore
off
the
covers
true
the
steam
bank
of
the
boiling
seas
lay
behind
them
below
them
was
the
land
what
did
it
hold
in
store
xx
the
whoomangs
thoroughly
exhausted
by
their
flight
across
the
boiling
seas
the
radio
man
and
his
two
strange
huge
doggo
and
the
beautiful
vairking
maiden
to
land
at
once
without
waiting
to
ascertain
what
particular
section
of
cupia
lay
beneath
them
but
the
entire
area
below
appeared
to
be
thickly
wooded
accordingly
the
fugitives
hovered
down
to
a
short
distance
above
the
ground
and
then
just
skimmed
the
treetops
at
a
slow
rate
of
speed
keeping
a
careful
watch
for
a
landing
place
they
had
not
long
to
wait
for
presently
they
espied
a
road
running
beneath
the
trees
and
after
putting
on
more
speed
and
following
this
road
for
a
couple
of
stads
they
finally
came
to
a
sufficiently
large
clearing
a
short
distance
from
the
road
to
enable
them
to
settle
down
quietly
to
the
ground
the
party
quickly
disembarked
upon
the
sward
and
the
three
companions
then
broke
through
the
bushes
to
the
road
which
proved
to
be
of
dirt
although
myles
remarked
this
must
be
some
very
part
of
my
country
for
practically
all
of
our
roads
are
built
of
concrete
a
material
similar
to
the
cement
with
which
i
fastened
the
bricks
together
in
making
our
furnaces
in
quivven
shuddered
please
don
t
remind
me
of
my
poor
city
she
begged
piteously
then
in
a
more
resigned
tone
but
that
is
behind
us
let
us
forget
it
and
face
the
future
you
were
speaking
of
cement
roads
yes
myles
replied
the
fact
that
this
road
is
not
made
of
concrete
indicates
that
it
is
not
a
main
highway
but
the
fact
that
it
is
shows
that
it
is
traveled
considerably
let
us
therefore
wait
for
some
who
can
tell
us
where
we
at
this
point
doggo
produced
a
pad
and
stylus
and
wrote
let
me
in
on
cabot
obligingly
transcribed
in
porovian
an
account
of
the
conversation
meanwhile
the
golden
girl
abstractedly
examined
the
foliage
beside
the
road
while
doggo
was
reading
the
manuscript
quivven
called
cabot
s
attention
to
the
trees
and
shrubs
how
different
they
are
from
those
in
vairkingia
she
remarked
that
is
to
be
expected
myles
answered
for
your
land
and
mine
are
separated
by
boiling
seas
across
which
no
seeds
or
spores
could
pass
and
live
thus
it
is
surprising
that
the
two
continents
support
even
the
same
general
classes
of
life
come
i
will
point
out
to
you
some
of
the
more
common
forms
of
our
he
had
in
mind
to
show
her
the
gray
and
the
tartan
bush
the
leaves
of
which
are
put
to
so
many
uses
by
the
cupians
and
the
saffra
herb
the
roots
of
which
are
used
for
anaesthesia
and
the
blue
and
yellow
dandelionlike
wild
flowers
but
although
he
searched
for
a
hundred
paces
or
so
along
the
road
he
was
unable
to
locate
a
single
specimen
of
these
very
common
bits
of
porovian
vegetation
it
is
strange
he
muttered
half
to
himself
when
i
want
to
show
the
common
plants
of
cupia
i
find
nothing
but
unfamiliar
plants
and
yet
i
ll
bet
that
if
i
were
to
go
out
in
search
of
rare
specimens
for
my
castle
garden
at
lake
luno
i
should
find
nothing
but
tartan
saffra
and
blue
the
mention
of
luno
castle
turned
his
thoughts
homeward
with
a
jerk
here
he
was
at
last
after
many
adventures
on
the
same
continent
with
his
lilla
and
his
baby
kew
he
had
come
here
to
rescue
them
if
it
were
not
too
late
from
yuri
the
usurper
and
his
whistling
bees
now
that
he
was
apparently
within
reach
of
his
loved
ones
he
began
to
worry
about
their
safety
a
great
deal
more
than
ever
before
but
this
fear
lilla
was
completely
by
a
growing
fear
lilla
what
would
she
say
to
his
two
allies
doggo
the
was
a
representative
of
a
race
which
cabot
had
vowed
to
exterminate
from
the
face
of
poros
for
as
he
had
repeatedly
asserted
there
can
be
no
lasting
peace
on
any
continent
which
is
inhabited
by
more
than
one
race
of
intelligent
beings
and
quivven
the
vairking
maiden
would
be
even
more
difficult
to
explain
she
was
beautiful
even
by
cupian
standards
she
was
more
nearly
the
same
race
as
myles
than
was
his
own
wife
lilla
she
and
myles
could
talk
together
unheard
by
the
of
lilla
in
these
circumstances
it
was
hardly
possible
that
the
princess
lilla
would
receive
quivven
with
open
arms
or
even
be
passably
decent
to
her
at
this
point
his
reveries
was
interrupted
by
doggo
handing
him
the
following
note
if
we
are
to
await
do
you
not
think
it
would
be
well
to
return
to
the
plane
and
secure
our
rifles
so
as
to
protect
ourselves
in
case
the
should
prove
to
be
hostile
myles
nodded
his
assent
and
informed
quivven
of
their
intentions
she
being
nearer
to
the
point
where
they
had
entered
the
road
plunged
through
the
bushes
at
once
and
they
hastened
after
her
just
as
myles
and
doggo
were
breaking
through
the
bushes
in
the
wake
of
the
golden
one
they
heard
an
agonized
scream
ahead
redoubling
their
efforts
they
reached
the
clearing
in
an
instant
and
beheld
a
most
unexpected
sight
perched
upon
the
airship
like
a
flock
of
enormous
vultures
were
about
a
dozen
huge
pale
green
reptiles
each
with
a
of
fully
and
one
of
these
loathsome
creatures
held
the
writhing
form
of
quivven
tight
in
its
claws
without
a
moment
s
thought
for
his
own
safety
the
intrepid
drew
the
vairkingian
sword
which
hung
at
his
side
and
rushed
straight
at
the
beast
which
held
the
girl
doggo
followed
close
behind
clicking
his
mandibles
angrily
but
before
they
could
reach
the
plane
the
noisome
flock
flapped
heavily
into
the
air
and
disappeared
over
the
trees
to
the
northward
quivven
s
childish
face
an
agony
of
despair
and
one
little
furry
paw
waving
a
forlorn
farewell
the
next
move
was
obvious
myles
and
doggo
sprang
to
their
places
in
the
aircraft
and
soared
after
it
was
an
easy
matter
to
overtake
the
saurians
but
not
so
easy
to
decide
what
to
do
after
reaching
them
the
reptiles
flew
so
close
together
their
pursuers
were
afraid
to
fire
on
them
for
fear
of
hitting
quivven
the
girl
was
as
yet
apparently
unharmed
so
the
only
thing
to
do
seemed
to
be
to
follow
and
watch
for
some
opportunity
to
effect
a
rescue
thus
the
chase
continued
for
several
stads
without
event
myles
was
in
an
agony
for
the
safety
of
his
little
friend
but
even
his
deep
concern
did
not
keep
his
scientific
mind
from
speculating
about
the
pale
green
dragons
which
he
was
following
he
had
read
about
such
beasts
in
books
on
paleontology
as
a
child
these
were
undoubtedly
pterodactyls
he
had
seen
somewhat
similar
stuffed
specimens
in
the
imperial
museum
at
kuana
capital
of
cupia
he
had
encountered
swarms
of
tiny
pterosaurs
the
size
of
sparrows
in
the
caves
of
kar
but
he
had
been
informed
by
cupian
scientists
that
the
larger
species
had
long
since
become
extinct
on
poros
whence
then
these
captors
of
quivven
while
engaged
thus
in
speculations
he
flew
a
bit
closer
to
the
flock
whereat
two
of
them
suddenly
turned
and
simultaneously
attacked
the
plane
from
both
sides
doggo
instantly
dispatched
assailant
with
a
rifle
shot
but
myles
did
not
dare
let
go
of
the
control
levers
as
he
was
flying
too
close
to
the
tree
tops
for
safety
as
it
was
accordingly
assailant
got
a
clawhold
on
the
side
of
the
fusilage
furled
its
wings
and
started
to
crawl
in
but
the
steered
the
machine
high
into
the
air
as
his
companion
swung
around
and
fired
at
the
intruder
which
promptly
let
go
its
hold
and
falling
with
a
shriek
of
pain
crashed
through
the
tree
tops
and
disappeared
from
view
myles
drew
a
deep
breath
of
relief
and
once
more
swooped
down
on
the
flock
of
pterosaurs
but
this
time
he
kept
at
a
safe
distance
from
them
and
they
warned
by
the
fate
of
their
two
comrades
did
not
attempt
any
further
sallies
at
the
plane
so
the
pursuit
continued
occasionally
between
the
green
wings
the
two
in
the
airship
could
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
form
of
quivven
held
fast
in
the
talons
of
her
captor
she
was
still
alive
she
did
not
seem
to
be
in
pain
once
she
waved
feebly
to
her
friends
above
what
would
those
beasts
do
with
her
the
question
was
soon
to
be
answered
but
first
it
was
to
be
succeeded
by
many
other
questions
for
a
large
and
prosperous
looking
city
loomed
ahead
its
appearance
was
unfamiliar
to
cabot
strange
he
thought
that
he
knew
all
the
principal
settlements
of
cupia
its
architecture
was
of
an
unknown
type
not
the
pueblolike
piles
of
exaggerated
toy
building
blocks
affected
by
the
formians
nor
the
spires
and
minarets
of
the
cupians
but
rather
a
style
somewhat
resembling
classical
greek
or
roman
the
architecture
was
immaterial
however
compared
with
the
fact
that
this
was
a
city
of
some
sort
a
city
of
a
high
degree
of
civilization
the
beasts
were
apparently
headed
straight
for
it
and
thus
there
was
every
prospect
of
the
quivven
suppose
however
it
was
a
deserted
city
its
unfamiliar
style
and
remote
location
suggested
as
much
perhaps
this
was
the
long
forgotten
court
of
some
cupian
jamshyd
now
kept
by
lion
and
lizard
or
rather
by
woofus
and
pterodactyl
this
was
not
so
however
for
as
cabot
drew
nearer
he
could
clearly
see
that
the
buildings
were
in
an
excellent
state
of
repair
with
not
a
crumbling
ruin
among
them
no
this
was
an
city
to
which
the
green
dragons
were
bringing
their
prey
could
it
be
that
the
cupian
inhabitants
kept
these
creatures
as
pets
and
that
this
fact
was
unknown
to
the
scientists
at
the
cupian
metropolis
cabot
s
cogitations
were
again
cut
short
by
his
arrival
over
the
city
the
dragons
made
straight
for
an
imposing
domed
edifice
which
they
entered
by
one
of
the
upper
windows
the
plane
promptly
dropped
into
a
plaza
making
a
sign
to
the
to
guard
the
ship
myles
seized
a
rifle
and
cartridges
and
rushed
down
a
street
which
led
toward
the
building
which
the
green
beasts
had
entered
on
the
way
he
met
several
pterosaurs
four
or
five
reptiles
ranging
in
size
from
that
of
a
small
dog
to
that
of
a
horse
one
large
snake
about
thirty
feet
in
length
various
sorts
of
insects
and
a
few
furry
creatures
but
not
a
single
cupian
if
these
were
the
pets
of
the
city
where
were
their
masters
the
strange
creatures
did
not
offer
to
molest
him
in
fact
they
gave
way
to
him
with
every
indication
of
respect
and
not
a
little
fear
this
seemed
to
indicate
that
they
were
all
thoroughly
domesticated
so
he
made
no
effort
to
hurt
them
at
last
he
arrived
at
the
building
which
he
sought
a
wide
incline
led
from
the
street
up
to
its
arched
doorway
this
smacked
of
formia
for
the
before
they
were
driven
off
the
continent
had
used
ramps
everywhere
instead
of
the
flight
of
stairs
employed
by
the
cupians
over
the
door
was
an
inscription
in
unmistakable
porovian
characters
the
palace
of
the
city
of
this
must
be
cupia
or
old
occupied
by
the
this
was
the
language
of
those
two
races
but
then
he
reflected
it
had
also
been
the
language
of
the
vairkings
far
across
the
boiling
seas
putting
an
end
to
his
speculations
he
rushed
up
the
ramp
and
entered
the
building
the
splendidly
arched
and
vaulted
interior
was
crowded
with
the
strangest
assortment
of
animals
the
had
ever
set
eyes
upon
picture
to
yourself
frank
buck
s
circus
the
new
york
zoo
and
the
of
kuana
all
turned
loose
in
one
hall
and
then
you
wouldn
t
imagine
of
it
for
very
few
of
these
assembled
beasts
bore
the
slightest
resemblance
to
anything
which
you
or
even
myles
cabot
had
ever
seen
he
paused
aghast
and
surveyed
the
assemblage
there
was
not
a
human
or
cupian
present
not
even
an
at
the
farther
side
of
the
chamber
on
a
raised
platform
there
rather
gigantic
pterosaur
whose
wingspread
must
have
been
at
least
twenty
feet
from
tip
to
tip
this
beast
unlike
those
which
had
kidnapped
quivven
was
pale
rather
than
green
his
head
was
square
with
a
sharp
crested
beak
large
circular
lidless
eyes
and
earholes
but
no
ears
four
legs
he
had
very
much
like
those
of
a
toad
except
that
the
fifth
finger
of
each
hand
the
finger
which
should
have
been
the
little
finger
extended
backward
over
his
hips
to
a
distance
of
about
six
feet
and
served
as
the
other
supporting
edge
of
his
leathery
wings
which
now
lay
furled
at
his
side
in
front
of
this
creature
stood
quivven
the
golden
flame
guarded
by
two
of
the
smaller
pterodactyls
and
seemingly
unhurt
and
unafraid
none
of
the
animals
appeared
to
have
noticed
cabot
s
entrance
so
he
decided
to
wait
a
few
moments
and
size
up
the
situation
before
doing
anything
rash
as
he
watched
the
scene
a
huge
snake
some
thirty
feet
in
length
and
at
least
half
a
yard
in
diameter
squirmed
on
to
the
platform
beside
the
dragon
this
snake
had
two
rudimentary
legs
and
two
small
arms
none
of
which
it
used
to
help
its
progression
but
in
one
hand
it
carried
what
appeared
to
be
a
sheet
of
paper
which
it
handed
with
a
hiss
to
the
dragon
who
hissed
in
reply
and
taking
the
paper
appeared
to
read
it
this
called
the
attention
of
the
to
the
fact
that
each
of
the
animals
about
him
was
equipped
with
a
pad
and
stylus
occasionally
one
would
scratch
something
on
its
pad
and
then
make
two
sharp
clicks
with
its
mouth
at
which
a
small
winged
lizard
would
take
the
missive
and
fly
with
it
to
some
other
part
of
the
chamber
standing
very
near
myles
there
was
a
small
and
particularly
furry
animal
somewhat
resembling
a
beaver
in
cupia
myles
would
have
assumed
that
it
was
some
species
of
mathlab
except
for
its
lack
of
antennae
this
looked
like
a
good
safe
specimen
to
experiment
upon
so
he
reached
for
its
pad
which
to
his
great
surprise
the
creature
promptly
handed
him
without
demur
together
with
its
stylus
remembering
the
inscription
above
the
arched
doorway
myles
wrote
in
porovian
shorthand
most
excellent
cabot
a
weary
sojourner
craves
protection
for
himself
and
the
golden
one
who
now
stands
before
you
we
are
from
cupia
and
vairkingi
respectively
what
country
is
this
then
he
folded
the
paper
and
clicked
twice
with
his
tongue
against
the
roof
of
his
mouth
instantly
a
fluttering
messenger
was
at
his
side
indicating
the
platform
with
a
gesture
he
handed
the
note
to
the
little
winged
reptile
who
flew
away
with
it
myles
passed
the
pad
and
stylus
back
to
the
furry
creature
from
whom
he
had
borrowed
it
and
then
watched
the
great
dragon
to
whom
he
had
written
this
beast
received
and
read
the
note
while
the
messenger
hovered
nigh
then
steadying
a
pad
against
the
floor
with
one
front
claw
he
wrote
on
it
with
a
stylus
held
in
the
other
what
he
had
written
he
showed
to
the
snake
which
lay
coiled
beside
him
and
upon
obtaining
a
hiss
of
approval
folded
the
note
and
gave
it
to
the
little
bat
who
flew
back
with
it
to
myles
on
the
paper
written
in
unmistakable
porovian
characters
were
the
words
welcome
to
yat
myles
cabot
you
and
your
mate
are
our
guests
we
know
of
no
country
of
either
cupia
or
vairkingi
this
is
the
land
of
the
whoomangs
and
i
am
boomalayla
their
king
you
have
permission
to
approach
the
so
explained
the
strange
plants
the
dirt
roads
the
unfamiliar
architecture
and
the
absence
of
cupians
and
vairkings
this
must
be
a
continent
intermediate
between
the
other
two
well
the
plane
was
intact
and
king
boomalayla
had
assured
him
that
they
were
guests
so
that
it
was
just
as
well
that
they
had
landed
on
this
azores
of
the
boiling
seas
reassured
the
made
his
way
through
the
strange
throng
to
the
foot
of
the
throne
where
he
bowed
low
before
the
hideous
reptile
monarch
little
quivven
with
a
cry
of
glad
surprise
rushed
over
to
him
and
nestled
confidingly
by
his
side
placing
one
arm
protectingly
around
her
he
boldly
confronted
the
winged
king
this
beast
after
some
penciled
conversation
with
his
serpent
adviser
handed
myles
a
note
reading
as
follows
our
nation
was
founded
many
years
ago
by
a
creature
closely
resembling
yourself
therefore
you
are
an
honored
guest
among
us
we
have
long
awaited
this
day
it
is
true
that
you
have
killed
the
bodies
of
two
of
my
subjects
and
thereby
subjected
their
souls
to
a
premature
birth
the
penalty
for
this
would
ordinarily
be
to
have
a
similar
death
imposed
upon
your
own
body
but
because
of
your
resemblance
to
our
great
originator
namllup
i
shall
spare
your
body
furthermore
i
fear
that
like
him
you
may
perhaps
have
no
soul
although
this
deficiency
can
easily
be
myles
read
the
note
and
handed
it
to
quivven
then
pointed
to
the
writing
materials
of
the
saurian
instantly
two
of
the
tiny
winged
messengers
brought
him
a
pad
and
stylus
thus
supplied
he
asked
the
king
great
ruler
does
your
offer
of
protection
include
my
wings
and
the
black
creature
who
guards
them
in
the
public
square
outside
and
how
about
little
me
asked
quivven
reading
over
his
shoulder
he
has
already
pledged
his
friendship
to
both
of
us
replied
myles
handing
the
note
to
one
of
the
tiny
pterosaurs
back
came
the
answer
from
the
king
you
and
yours
shall
all
be
protected
i
will
now
send
guards
to
relieve
your
guard
at
the
wings
and
to
summon
him
into
my
but
the
held
up
one
hand
in
a
gesture
of
protest
and
hurriedly
wrote
better
not
your
majesty
unless
you
wish
a
fight
i
will
send
a
note
explaining
all
you
can
then
follow
it
in
a
few
paraparths
with
your
detachment
of
to
this
proposal
the
huge
saurian
assented
so
myles
dispatched
to
doggo
by
one
of
the
tiny
pterosaurs
a
long
written
explanation
of
the
situation
a
few
minutes
later
under
orders
from
the
reptile
king
the
flock
of
green
pterodactyls
who
had
been
the
original
captors
of
quivven
departed
with
much
leathery
flapping
through
one
of
the
windows
overhead
and
presently
one
of
them
returned
on
foot
with
doggo
what
kind
of
a
is
this
we
have
got
into
were
the
s
first
words
as
cabot
handed
him
the
pad
and
stylus
the
great
builder
only
knows
his
friend
replied
anyhow
they
claim
to
possess
souls
and
have
offered
us
doggo
looked
skeptical
just
then
a
messenger
flitted
over
with
a
note
from
boomalayla
reading
the
session
is
at
an
end
you
will
please
follow
me
to
the
royal
apartments
for
a
the
king
clicked
sharply
instantly
all
was
silence
in
the
huge
hall
solemnly
the
king
clicked
three
times
in
unison
the
assembled
whoomangs
clicked
back
a
triple
answer
then
all
was
bustle
and
confusion
as
those
without
wings
crowded
through
the
doors
and
those
with
wings
departed
through
the
windows
in
the
dome
above
boomalayla
and
his
snake
adviser
and
the
three
travelers
from
vairkingi
were
the
only
you
can
call
them
all
persons
in
the
vaulted
chamber
whereupon
the
snake
gliding
ahead
led
the
way
to
an
anteroom
gorgeously
jeweled
and
draped
there
the
five
reclined
on
soft
tapestries
attended
by
a
swarm
of
little
messengers
and
engaged
in
the
following
written
conversation
due
to
the
speed
of
porovian
shorthand
the
talk
progressed
practically
as
rapidly
as
if
it
had
been
spoken
although
doggo
was
somewhat
handicapped
by
not
having
a
stylus
which
was
properly
adapted
to
his
claw
who
are
your
companions
the
king
asked
so
myles
introduced
quivven
the
vairking
maiden
and
doggo
the
formian
boomalayla
explained
that
the
snake
was
queekle
mukki
prime
minister
of
the
whoomangs
and
wise
beyond
all
his
countrymen
his
soul
is
brother
to
my
soul
although
our
bodies
are
unrelated
the
king
wrote
myles
was
much
perplexed
how
is
it
he
inquired
that
such
diversified
animals
as
you
whoomangs
are
able
to
live
at
peace
with
each
other
it
was
not
so
before
the
days
of
namllup
the
huge
pterosaur
replied
but
he
gave
us
souls
and
made
us
one
people
our
bodies
may
be
unrelated
but
our
souls
are
the
same
you
and
your
two
companions
are
as
unalike
as
any
of
us
perhaps
the
three
of
have
a
common
type
of
myles
was
even
more
perplexed
who
was
namllup
he
asked
and
what
means
all
this
talk
of
souls
xxi
souls
in
reply
to
cabot
s
question
the
huge
winged
saurian
boomalayla
king
of
the
whoomangs
wrote
the
following
reply
all
that
i
am
about
to
tell
you
of
the
traditional
beginning
of
our
race
is
shrouded
in
the
mists
of
antiquity
the
legend
is
as
follows
many
hundreds
of
years
ago
this
fertile
continent
was
inhabited
by
warring
beasts
of
every
conceivable
size
and
form
and
they
were
but
brute
creatures
for
they
had
no
souls
souls
existed
it
is
true
but
inasmuch
as
they
inhabited
no
bodies
they
had
no
learning
experience
or
background
they
were
of
but
little
use
to
themselves
each
other
or
the
planet
then
one
day
there
was
born
out
of
the
ground
a
creature
much
like
yourself
his
name
was
namllup
he
it
was
who
discovered
how
to
introduce
souls
into
bodies
by
making
a
slight
incision
at
the
base
of
the
brain
and
inserting
there
a
young
soul
first
he
captured
some
very
tame
wild
creatures
and
gave
them
souls
with
their
aid
he
captured
others
more
fierce
and
so
on
until
there
was
hardly
a
beast
left
soulless
on
this
continent
thus
did
he
make
of
one
race
all
the
creatures
of
poros
to
dwell
together
on
the
face
of
the
continent
this
industry
we
have
kept
up
to
this
day
it
is
reported
however
that
namllup
himself
had
no
soul
there
was
no
scar
at
the
back
of
his
head
and
no
soul
issued
from
his
body
after
death
others
he
gave
soul
to
himself
he
could
not
this
is
the
general
all
this
was
as
clear
as
mud
to
myles
cabot
he
could
not
make
head
nor
tail
out
of
it
boomalayla
appeared
to
be
talking
in
riddles
or
allegories
nevertheless
myles
determined
to
try
and
make
a
beginning
somewhere
in
order
to
understand
what
this
mass
of
verbiage
was
all
about
so
he
wrote
how
can
you
tell
surely
you
can
not
souls
surely
we
the
reptile
king
replied
for
souls
are
creatures
just
as
real
as
we
are
and
have
an
independent
existence
from
the
day
they
hatch
until
they
are
inserted
in
the
brain
of
somebody
from
the
way
you
talk
i
can
not
believe
that
have
any
of
course
i
have
myles
remonstrated
prove
it
to
me
boomalayla
demanded
let
me
see
the
back
of
your
myles
complied
no
the
winged
king
continued
you
have
no
soul
there
is
no
this
conversation
was
irritating
in
the
extreme
it
led
nowhere
quivven
and
doggo
read
all
the
correspondence
and
were
equally
perplexed
the
huge
pterosaur
continued
writing
i
can
see
that
you
do
not
believe
me
he
wrote
this
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
since
you
yourself
are
soulless
though
i
can
not
understand
how
a
beast
like
you
without
a
soul
can
be
as
intelligent
as
you
seem
to
be
come
to
our
temple
and
i
will
show
you
so
saying
boomalayla
accompanied
by
queekle
mukki
the
serpent
led
cabot
and
his
two
companions
out
of
the
buildings
and
through
the
streets
of
the
city
to
another
edifice
which
they
entered
what
a
travesty
on
the
lost
religion
of
cupia
within
the
temple
there
moved
about
a
score
or
more
of
assorted
reptiles
huge
insects
furry
creatures
and
so
absolutely
no
resemblance
to
each
other
except
the
fact
that
each
and
every
one
of
them
wore
a
long
robe
emblazoned
with
a
crimson
triangle
and
swastika
emblem
of
the
true
religion
of
poros
among
them
was
one
enormous
pterosaur
almost
the
exact
counterpart
of
boomalayla
the
king
who
introduced
this
beast
to
his
guests
by
means
of
the
following
note
this
is
the
chief
priest
of
the
true
religion
she
is
my
mate
but
come
let
me
show
you
some
the
chief
priest
then
led
the
party
into
an
adjoining
room
the
walls
of
which
were
lined
with
tiny
cages
most
of
which
contained
pairs
of
moths
the
dragon
king
explained
as
follows
when
a
whoomang
dies
his
body
is
brought
to
the
temple
and
is
watched
day
and
night
by
a
priest
net
in
hand
to
catch
the
soul
when
it
what
it
had
to
do
with
cabot
couldn
t
see
for
the
life
of
him
neither
could
quivven
nor
doggo
having
made
a
complete
tour
of
inspection
the
party
then
returned
to
the
palace
where
they
discussed
the
glories
of
vairkingi
and
cupia
with
the
king
and
queekle
mukki
and
then
dined
on
cereal
cakes
and
a
flesh
resembling
fish
be
not
afraid
to
eat
this
boomalayla
urged
it
is
fresh
flesh
we
breed
these
water
reptiles
especially
for
after
the
meal
the
three
travelers
were
assigned
rooms
in
the
palace
at
cabot
s
request
tapestries
were
brought
from
the
plane
and
the
party
severally
retired
for
the
night
the
next
morning
they
were
up
early
and
assembled
in
cabot
s
room
the
night
had
proved
uneventful
but
doggo
wrote
in
great
excitement
that
he
had
talked
with
the
green
guards
who
had
refused
to
disclose
the
whereabouts
of
the
plane
and
had
said
that
this
was
the
king
s
order
immediately
after
breakfast
which
consisted
of
cakes
and
sweetened
water
they
requested
an
audience
with
the
when
it
was
granted
demanded
news
of
the
plane
but
boomalayla
waved
them
off
with
an
evasive
answer
tarry
but
a
day
or
so
he
wrote
and
then
your
wings
shall
be
returned
to
you
and
you
shall
be
permitted
to
depart
i
promise
it
on
the
word
of
honor
of
a
so
there
was
nothing
but
to
wait
for
it
would
not
do
to
antagonize
this
powerful
beast
and
thus
perhaps
lose
forever
the
chance
to
return
which
he
had
promised
them
the
day
was
spent
in
a
tour
of
the
city
with
boomalayla
as
a
most
courteous
and
attentive
guide
and
host
the
whoomangs
appeared
to
be
a
highly
cultivated
race
if
you
can
call
them
a
race
congeries
would
perhaps
be
the
most
accurate
term
objects
of
all
the
arts
abounded
and
the
tour
would
have
been
most
pleasurable
if
the
three
travelers
had
not
been
so
anxious
to
be
on
their
way
once
more
to
cupia
the
night
was
spent
as
before
uneventfully
but
the
next
day
doggo
was
missing
in
reply
to
all
inquiries
the
whoomangs
returned
evasive
answers
he
is
gone
on
business
of
his
own
was
all
they
would
say
this
day
queekle
mukki
the
serpent
was
their
host
and
guide
he
used
every
effort
to
outdo
boomalayla
in
courtesy
but
his
two
guests
were
strangely
uneasy
some
impending
calamity
seemed
to
hang
over
them
late
that
evening
when
they
were
in
their
quarters
doggo
rushed
in
bristling
with
excitement
he
had
something
to
tell
them
and
wanted
to
tell
it
quickly
but
had
mislaid
his
pad
and
stylus
strange
to
relate
cabot
could
not
find
his
own
writing
materials
either
quivven
finally
found
her
stylus
but
no
pad
seizing
the
stick
doggo
scratched
on
the
pavement
of
the
room
quick
give
me
paper
quick
your
lives
depend
upon
it
quick
before
it
is
too
late
cabot
rushed
into
the
hall
and
clicked
twice
with
his
tongue
against
the
roof
of
his
mouth
but
nothing
happened
again
and
again
he
repeated
the
call
until
finally
one
of
the
little
winged
messengers
flitted
into
sight
to
him
the
indicated
his
wants
by
going
through
the
motions
of
writing
with
the
index
finger
of
his
right
hand
upon
the
palm
of
his
left
the
little
creature
flitted
away
and
after
what
seemed
an
interminable
wait
returned
with
pad
and
stylus
myles
snatched
them
and
rushed
back
to
doggo
what
is
the
matter
he
wrote
but
doggo
replied
nothing
it
was
just
a
joke
to
frighten
you
we
are
all
perfectly
safe
here
and
boomalayla
has
a
wonderful
plan
to
facilitate
our
departure
three
days
from
it
was
not
like
doggo
or
any
other
member
of
the
serious
minded
race
of
to
play
a
practical
joke
like
this
myles
could
swear
that
his
friend
had
been
genuinely
agitated
a
few
moments
ago
what
could
have
happened
in
the
meantime
to
change
him
the
looked
at
the
formian
steadily
through
narrowed
lids
his
friend
appeared
to
act
strangely
could
this
in
truth
be
doggo
if
they
had
been
on
any
other
continent
myles
would
have
sworn
that
some
other
closely
resembling
his
friend
was
attempting
an
impersonation
but
that
could
not
be
the
case
here
for
doggo
was
certainly
the
only
formian
on
this
continent
it
was
doggo
s
body
all
right
yet
it
did
not
act
or
look
like
doggo
even
quivven
noticed
that
something
was
wrong
nervously
she
said
good
night
and
cabot
followed
shortly
after
instead
of
retiring
he
went
to
quivven
s
room
where
the
two
puzzled
together
for
some
time
trying
to
guess
what
had
come
over
their
friend
what
at
last
they
parted
for
the
night
the
mystery
was
no
nearer
solution
than
before
in
fact
they
had
practically
made
up
their
minds
that
no
mystery
existed
after
all
and
that
the
strange
surroundings
and
strange
events
and
strange
talk
of
souls
had
merely
cast
an
aura
of
strangeness
even
over
their
friend
the
next
morning
doggo
was
on
hand
bright
and
early
but
this
time
it
was
quivven
who
was
missing
my
turn
next
thought
myles
and
then
perhaps
i
shall
find
out
what
it
is
all
as
before
the
whoomangs
were
evasive
as
to
the
whereabouts
of
the
golden
one
and
even
doggo
was
singularly
unresponsive
and
devoid
of
ideas
on
the
subject
this
day
the
was
their
guide
but
although
she
outdid
both
boomalayla
and
queekle
mukki
cabot
fretted
and
worried
and
merely
put
on
an
external
show
of
interest
late
that
their
stay
among
the
soon
as
the
tour
was
over
cabot
left
doggo
and
withdrew
to
his
own
room
where
was
quivven
all
this
time
he
wondered
his
question
was
answered
by
the
golden
flame
herself
bursting
into
the
room
full
of
excitement
thank
the
builder
i
can
talk
to
you
with
my
mouth
and
do
not
have
to
wait
for
pencil
and
paper
she
exclaimed
the
whoomangs
overlooked
our
powers
of
vocal
speech
when
they
hid
our
writing
materials
as
it
was
true
their
pads
and
styluses
had
miraculously
disappeared
again
where
have
you
been
cabot
asked
somewhat
testily
i
suppose
that
in
a
few
moments
you
will
say
that
all
excitement
has
been
a
mere
practical
joke
on
me
the
same
as
doggo
s
yes
she
replied
seriously
i
and
therefore
listen
while
there
is
yet
i
am
still
what
do
you
mean
myles
exclaimed
staring
at
her
this
she
said
in
a
few
moments
i
shall
be
he
started
to
interrupt
but
she
stopped
him
with
a
peremptory
gesture
and
continued
know
then
the
secret
of
all
this
talk
of
souls
the
grubs
which
they
breed
from
their
moths
are
strong
personalities
potential
devils
needing
only
a
body
in
order
to
become
devils
incarnate
namllup
whoever
he
was
discovered
this
ages
ago
by
a
simple
operation
the
whoomangs
can
insert
one
of
these
larvae
at
the
base
of
a
creature
s
brain
where
in
a
few
hours
the
personality
of
the
larva
overcomes
the
proper
personality
of
the
creature
and
henceforth
rules
the
creature
until
the
creature
dies
the
larva
then
flutters
free
a
moth
to
propagate
other
for
this
nefarious
usage
yesterday
these
fiends
operated
upon
doggo
for
a
time
his
own
soul
and
this
struggled
for
supremacy
while
his
own
personality
remained
ascendant
and
yet
had
imbibed
sufficient
knowledge
to
understand
the
situation
he
tried
to
warn
us
of
our
danger
would
that
he
had
been
in
time
but
when
the
pad
of
paper
had
arrived
dear
old
doggo
was
dead
his
body
had
become
a
whoomang
dominated
by
one
of
their
souls
as
they
call
them
this
afternoon
they
operated
on
me
myles
shuddered
but
quivven
went
relentlessly
on
two
personalities
are
now
contending
within
me
for
mastery
there
can
be
but
one
outcome
quivven
must
die
and
her
brain
and
body
must
become
the
vehicle
for
the
thoughts
and
schemes
of
an
alien
mind
my
will
is
strong
at
present
it
is
in
control
but
any
moment
now
it
may
snap
so
i
adjure
you
by
the
great
builder
and
your
loved
ones
refuse
stonily
and
absolutely
to
listen
to
any
denial
which
my
mouth
may
give
you
now
while
there
is
yet
time
i
must
tell
you
their
plans
boomalayla
sighs
for
more
worlds
to
conquer
he
was
captivated
by
your
tales
of
your
country
he
will
operate
on
you
then
when
the
bodies
of
you
and
doggo
and
i
are
all
whoomangs
and
yet
retain
a
certain
amount
of
our
own
knowledge
and
skill
he
plans
to
send
us
on
to
cupia
with
a
of
moths
to
operate
on
your
countrymen
and
build
up
a
second
empire
of
whoomangs
myles
gasped
at
the
dastardliness
of
the
plan
a
plan
which
might
yet
succeed
for
even
if
he
escaped
doggo
s
body
might
still
carry
the
plan
into
execution
where
is
our
plane
he
asked
yes
quivven
sadly
replied
i
must
lead
you
to
the
plane
while
i
am
yet
me
come
but
can
we
leave
doggo
yes
she
replied
not
only
must
you
leave
doggo
but
you
must
leave
me
too
for
doggo
is
no
longer
doggo
and
i
shall
not
be
quivven
in
a
few
minutes
from
now
for
i
feel
the
struggling
for
ascendency
within
me
come
quickly
she
led
him
out
of
the
room
and
down
several
hallways
to
a
courtyard
of
the
palace
where
stood
the
plane
guarded
by
a
green
dragon
this
beast
interposed
no
objection
to
their
approach
quivven
smiled
wanly
he
will
not
stop
you
she
said
for
already
they
regard
me
as
one
of
them
and
count
on
me
to
inveigle
you
and
now
myles
i
feel
myself
slipping
in
a
minute
or
two
your
quivven
will
be
no
more
whether
my
own
soul
will
then
go
to
the
happy
land
as
though
i
had
normally
died
or
whether
it
will
simply
be
blotted
out
i
know
not
but
one
thing
i
know
and
that
is
that
i
love
you
with
all
my
she
flung
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
kissed
him
then
suddenly
she
cried
i
ve
won
i
made
you
love
me
it
was
all
a
scheme
cooked
up
by
doggo
and
myself
to
trap
you
out
of
your
complacency
and
force
you
to
admit
your
love
the
story
of
the
souls
is
a
lie
woven
out
of
the
weird
philosophizing
of
boomalayla
from
now
on
i
know
that
you
love
me
from
now
on
i
am
confident
that
i
can
compete
with
that
lilla
of
he
stood
aghast
could
this
be
so
he
was
half
inclined
to
believe
then
he
remembered
her
words
stonily
and
absolutely
to
listen
to
any
denial
which
my
mouth
may
give
also
he
reflected
that
doggo
certainly
would
never
have
been
a
party
to
a
trick
to
betray
lilla
so
he
thrust
the
golden
maid
to
one
side
and
strode
toward
the
plane
but
she
rushed
after
him
and
clung
to
him
wailing
piteously
myles
myles
surely
you
aren
t
going
to
desert
us
just
because
of
this
trick
which
we
played
on
you
surely
you
don
t
intend
to
leave
us
to
the
mercy
of
these
terrible
he
did
not
know
what
to
believe
there
was
a
possibility
that
her
story
about
the
souls
was
the
truth
if
so
then
the
safety
of
the
whole
continent
of
cupia
was
at
stake
and
yet
if
not
what
an
awful
country
to
leave
her
and
doggo
in
he
vaulted
into
the
plane
then
stood
irresolute
at
the
levers
he
looked
intently
at
the
golden
maid
who
clung
to
the
side
of
the
car
there
was
something
strange
about
her
face
something
clearly
and
yet
as
he
gazed
he
became
certain
that
it
was
quivven
after
all
and
he
was
right
myles
she
shouted
letting
go
the
plane
quick
by
the
grace
of
the
builder
my
own
spirit
is
again
in
the
ascendency
for
an
instant
the
story
i
told
you
is
true
flee
before
it
is
too
then
suddenly
she
changed
again
and
shouted
to
the
guardian
pterosaur
quick
stop
him
her
expression
altered
as
she
spoke
but
myles
slammed
on
the
power
and
the
machine
rose
quickly
leaving
behind
the
frantic
golden
form
of
little
quivven
after
him
trailed
a
swarm
of
winged
creatures
of
all
sorts
but
his
fast
airship
soon
outdistanced
them
as
it
sped
due
west
toward
a
sky
that
had
already
begun
to
turn
pink
with
the
unseen
setting
sun
on
and
on
he
sped
until
his
pursuers
dropped
from
view
then
he
turned
northward
to
throw
them
off
the
trail
and
then
after
a
while
due
west
again
until
as
night
was
about
to
fall
the
of
the
boiling
sea
loomed
ahead
whereupon
he
landed
he
must
wait
until
morning
before
attempting
the
passage
but
as
he
prepared
to
spend
the
night
he
noticed
that
all
the
tapestries
were
gone
from
the
cockpit
how
could
he
brave
the
steam
clouds
without
wrappings
of
some
sort
and
was
he
certain
after
all
that
he
was
not
leaving
two
perfectly
good
friends
in
the
lurch
xxii
flight
there
must
be
in
the
airship
in
which
he
could
swathe
himself
for
the
trip
across
the
boiling
seas
with
this
in
view
he
made
a
frantic
search
of
the
entire
cockpit
doggo
s
rifle
and
the
ammunition
were
still
there
but
his
own
he
had
left
in
his
room
on
his
hurried
departure
here
too
was
the
little
stone
lamp
by
the
light
of
which
they
had
watched
their
instruments
beneath
the
kayack
covering
even
some
of
their
provisions
were
left
finally
he
came
upon
some
boxes
which
he
did
not
recognize
a
rank
smell
became
evident
upon
closer
examination
gingerly
he
opened
one
of
those
boxes
it
contained
flesh
finely
ground
and
putrid
and
in
this
carrion
there
wriggled
and
swarmed
scores
of
small
white
grubs
the
last
of
cabot
s
doubts
vanished
these
were
the
which
he
and
doggo
and
quivven
had
been
expected
to
carry
to
cupia
to
found
there
a
new
empire
of
whoomangs
evidently
his
hosts
had
expected
some
possible
trouble
from
him
and
therefore
had
prepared
the
plane
for
a
quick
by
doggo
and
quivven
indignantly
the
lonely
emptied
out
box
after
box
onto
the
ground
and
mashed
the
contents
into
the
dirt
with
his
sandaled
feet
by
this
time
it
was
nearly
pitch
dark
but
of
course
this
would
make
no
difference
while
flying
through
steam
clouds
for
visibility
under
such
circumstances
would
be
impossible
even
in
daylight
if
he
only
had
some
covering
for
the
cockpit
to
keep
out
the
steam
he
could
fly
just
as
well
at
night
as
by
day
except
for
one
danger
how
could
he
be
warned
of
flying
too
high
passing
through
the
circumambient
cloud
envelope
and
being
shriveled
to
a
crisp
by
the
close
proximity
of
the
sun
in
despair
the
sat
beside
his
beached
airship
as
the
velvet
blackness
crept
out
of
the
east
and
enveloped
the
planet
so
near
and
yet
so
far
he
had
successfully
transmitted
himself
through
millions
of
miles
of
space
from
the
earth
to
poros
he
had
escaped
the
clutches
of
the
formians
and
the
roies
he
had
built
a
complete
radio
set
out
of
nothing
and
had
talked
with
cupia
across
the
boiling
seas
he
had
traversed
those
seas
once
without
accident
he
had
eluded
the
machinations
of
the
whoomangs
with
their
moth
grub
souls
and
yet
here
he
was
with
only
a
few
miles
of
ocean
separating
him
from
his
loved
ones
and
nevertheless
blocked
effectually
by
the
lack
of
a
few
yards
of
cloth
what
fate
as
the
last
purple
flush
died
on
the
western
horizon
myles
suddenly
jumped
to
his
feet
and
laughed
aloud
the
solution
was
so
obvious
that
it
had
completely
escaped
him
until
now
it
was
the
setting
sun
that
had
suggested
the
escape
from
his
dilemma
there
is
no
sun
at
night
of
course
not
therefore
why
not
soar
straight
up
pierce
the
cloud
envelope
and
fly
above
it
to
cupia
letting
the
clouds
protect
him
from
the
heat
of
the
boiling
seas
as
they
normally
protect
the
planet
from
the
light
and
heat
of
the
sun
at
any
rate
it
was
worth
trying
to
remain
where
he
was
would
mean
either
eventual
starvation
or
recapture
by
the
terrible
whoomangs
so
by
the
light
of
his
little
vairking
stone
lamp
he
made
a
hasty
lunch
from
his
few
remaining
provisions
and
then
took
his
stand
at
the
levers
for
a
new
experiment
in
porovian
navigation
up
up
he
shot
through
the
dense
blackness
up
to
a
height
which
in
earth
would
have
filled
his
blood
with
air
bubbles
and
have
suffocated
his
lungs
but
on
poros
with
its
thicker
atmospheric
shell
and
its
lesser
gravity
the
change
was
not
so
evident
far
to
the
eastward
he
saw
the
lights
of
yat
the
city
of
the
beasts
but
this
was
his
only
landmark
there
was
nothing
but
his
to
tell
him
exactly
which
was
north
and
south
and
east
and
west
nothing
but
his
clinometer
to
indicate
whether
he
was
going
up
or
down
nothing
but
his
altimeter
to
indicate
his
approximate
height
above
the
surface
of
the
planet
and
these
instruments
he
must
read
by
the
flickering
light
of
a
primitive
open
wick
stone
lamp
on
the
floor
of
the
cockpit
what
if
this
faint
illuminator
should
become
extinguished
he
certainly
could
not
leave
the
controls
for
long
enough
to
use
flint
and
steel
to
rekindle
it
during
the
early
part
of
his
stay
in
vairkingi
he
had
always
gone
to
some
one
of
the
constantly
burning
lamps
which
were
the
primitive
fire
source
of
the
furry
vairkings
later
he
had
found
several
pieces
of
flint
when
investigating
a
small
chalk
deposit
as
a
possible
alternative
for
limestone
in
his
smelting
operations
after
the
manufacture
of
steel
had
begun
he
had
practiced
striking
a
light
in
this
more
modern
method
and
thereafter
had
always
carried
flint
and
steel
and
tinder
with
him
in
one
of
the
pouch
pockets
of
his
leather
tunic
it
was
with
these
crude
implements
that
he
had
kindled
his
oil
lamp
for
the
present
flight
but
this
fire
source
would
avail
him
little
if
a
gust
of
wind
should
extinguish
his
primitive
lamp
in
such
event
what
could
he
do
this
question
was
immediately
put
to
the
test
for
his
ship
struck
a
small
air
pocket
and
dipped
out
went
the
light
now
he
could
no
longer
read
his
compass
nor
his
altimeter
could
determine
the
inclination
of
the
plane
from
time
to
time
by
his
clinometer
so
on
upward
he
kept
presently
he
found
it
difficult
to
breath
and
this
difficulty
was
soon
increased
by
a
damp
fog
which
choked
his
nostrils
and
windpipe
causing
him
to
cough
and
sneeze
the
water
condensed
on
the
airship
and
dropped
off
the
rigging
onto
the
matted
hair
and
beard
of
the
yet
still
he
kept
on
up
finally
he
breathed
clear
air
once
more
he
pushed
back
the
dripping
locks
from
his
forehead
and
wiped
out
his
eyes
with
the
back
of
one
wrist
all
was
still
jet
darkness
yet
in
front
of
him
and
above
him
there
glowed
some
tiny
points
of
light
rubbing
his
eyes
he
looked
again
stars
the
first
stars
he
had
ever
seen
on
sky
full
of
stars
with
some
surprise
myles
cabot
noted
that
above
him
were
swung
the
same
constellations
with
which
he
had
been
familiar
on
earth
among
them
the
two
dippers
orion
and
cassiopea
he
strove
to
recall
the
inclination
of
the
axis
of
venus
to
the
ecliptic
but
all
that
he
could
remember
was
that
it
did
not
differ
appreciably
from
that
of
the
earth
this
information
was
enough
for
his
present
purposes
however
for
it
meant
that
the
star
which
we
call
the
pole
star
on
earth
was
approximately
north
on
poros
and
that
its
altitude
above
the
northern
horizon
would
give
approximately
the
latitude
of
the
location
of
the
observer
the
pole
star
which
he
readily
identified
by
means
of
the
two
pointers
of
the
great
dipper
now
hung
about
twenty
degrees
above
the
horizon
thus
showing
that
cabot
was
opposite
the
southern
tip
of
that
part
of
the
continent
of
cupia
which
formerly
was
formia
so
he
leveled
out
the
plane
and
turning
its
nose
northwest
by
the
stars
scudded
along
above
the
cloud
envelope
of
the
planet
it
was
not
long
before
he
noticed
a
quite
appreciable
increase
of
temperature
gusts
and
swirls
of
hot
vapor
assailed
him
from
below
so
that
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
gyroscopic
steadying
apparatus
he
must
surely
have
foundered
even
as
it
was
it
took
all
his
efforts
to
control
the
ship
he
suffered
fearfully
from
the
heat
but
it
was
not
absolutely
unbearable
navigation
so
compelled
his
entire
attention
that
he
lost
all
track
of
time
he
struggled
on
as
in
a
dream
and
had
not
the
slightest
idea
whether
he
had
been
flying
for
hours
or
only
for
minutes
on
and
on
he
drove
through
the
terrific
heat
until
at
last
he
got
so
used
to
it
that
it
actually
seemed
cooler
by
jove
he
could
almost
believe
that
the
air
really
was
cooler
so
cautiously
he
tipped
the
nose
of
the
plane
downward
and
entered
the
clouds
below
him
feeling
his
way
at
a
low
rate
of
speed
and
ever
ready
to
slam
on
the
full
force
of
his
trophil
engines
and
shoot
upward
once
more
he
gradually
penetrated
the
cloud
envelope
which
surrounds
the
planet
yet
the
heat
did
not
increase
at
last
he
was
through
and
below
him
twinkled
lights
the
lights
of
a
small
city
or
town
throwing
the
plane
level
once
more
he
hovered
down
in
true
porovian
fashion
the
light
of
the
town
showed
closer
cabot
s
heart
beat
fast
there
was
a
lump
in
his
throat
and
his
hands
trembled
at
the
controls
was
this
cupia
his
own
kingdom
of
cupia
at
last
was
he
home
his
heart
sank
within
this
some
still
new
continent
with
other
nightmare
beasts
and
horrible
adventures
whichever
it
was
he
ought
not
to
land
too
near
the
town
his
was
making
a
loud
racket
but
he
was
not
afraid
of
being
heard
for
cupians
have
no
ears
and
their
antennae
can
receive
only
radio
waves
so
he
skimmed
low
over
the
houses
straining
his
eyes
to
try
and
make
out
their
style
of
architecture
but
it
was
no
use
the
jet
blackness
of
porovian
night
obscured
all
below
accordingly
he
planned
to
land
about
half
a
stad
from
the
village
and
then
reconnoiter
at
daybreak
this
was
to
be
accomplished
as
follows
his
distance
from
the
ground
he
could
gauge
from
the
lights
of
the
houses
therefore
he
would
hold
his
craft
as
nearly
as
possible
level
and
hover
softly
down
taking
a
chance
of
landing
on
some
bush
or
tree
the
plan
worked
to
perfection
after
just
about
the
expected
drop
he
felt
the
skids
grate
on
solid
ground
land
once
more
after
his
sensational
flight
above
the
clouds
exhausted
and
relaxed
he
shut
off
his
motor
and
proceeded
to
crawl
over
the
edge
of
the
cockpit
of
course
he
could
not
even
see
his
own
machine
in
the
intense
darkness
as
he
started
to
clamber
out
the
plane
suddenly
tilted
a
bit
under
his
weight
then
gave
a
lurch
and
slid
out
from
under
him
dislodging
him
as
it
did
so
he
struck
the
ground
but
it
crumbled
beneath
him
and
he
felt
himself
slipping
and
sliding
down
a
steep
gravel
bank
until
finally
some
sort
of
a
projection
stopped
his
descent
to
this
projection
he
frantically
clung
during
his
slide
he
had
heard
the
loud
splash
of
the
airplane
below
him
so
he
knew
that
there
was
water
there
as
he
hung
to
the
projection
on
the
side
of
the
steep
sand
bank
he
looked
about
him
in
the
jet
black
night
and
as
he
looked
he
noticed
the
edge
of
the
bank
above
him
just
showing
against
the
sky
the
edge
became
more
and
more
distinct
the
sky
above
turned
to
slate
then
purple
then
red
then
pink
then
silver
day
had
come
once
more
cabot
found
himself
clinging
to
a
sharp
spur
of
rock
which
stuck
out
from
the
bank
so
he
hauled
himself
into
a
comfortable
position
upon
it
and
stared
around
at
his
surroundings
his
location
was
halfway
down
the
precipitous
side
of
a
craterlike
hole
about
a
quarter
of
a
stad
in
diameter
and
three
parastads
deep
the
banks
of
which
were
of
coarse
black
sand
at
the
bottom
a
clear
pool
of
water
reflected
the
silver
sky
there
was
no
sign
of
either
his
rifle
his
cartridge
belt
or
his
plane
he
possessed
nothing
save
his
leather
tunic
his
wooden
vairking
sword
a
steel
sheath
knife
which
he
had
made
in
his
foundries
at
vairkingi
and
the
contents
of
his
pockets
even
his
leather
helmet
was
gone
he
espied
it
floating
like
a
little
boat
far
out
upon
the
pond
but
even
as
he
looked
some
denizen
of
the
deep
snapped
at
it
and
it
disappeared
beneath
the
surface
this
was
a
forewarning
of
what
might
happen
to
myles
if
he
should
have
the
misfortune
to
slip
into
the
pool
below
well
he
must
risk
it
in
an
attempt
to
get
out
for
even
a
sudden
death
beneath
the
waters
was
preferable
to
starvation
on
a
rocky
perch
so
carefully
and
laboriously
he
attempted
the
ascent
many
times
he
slipped
back
losing
nearly
all
that
he
had
gained
but
fortunately
the
bank
was
rather
firm
in
spots
and
was
dotted
with
large
jagged
rocks
which
afforded
a
good
handhold
so
that
eventually
myles
reached
the
top
here
he
found
a
flat
plateau
flanked
by
a
continuous
hedge
of
bushes
about
thirty
paces
from
the
edge
these
bushes
were
too
high
to
see
over
and
grew
so
thickly
together
that
myles
was
unable
to
penetrate
them
round
and
round
the
top
of
the
pit
he
walked
repeatedly
trying
to
force
his
way
out
but
with
no
success
the
day
wore
on
myles
became
tired
and
hungry
and
thirsty
and
disgusted
by
placing
a
small
pebble
in
his
mouth
he
relieved
the
thirst
for
awhile
but
this
had
no
effect
on
his
other
symptoms
finally
even
his
thirst
returned
the
thirst
was
aggravated
by
the
presence
almost
at
his
feet
of
the
clear
pool
of
water
within
the
pit
he
almost
decided
to
slide
down
and
try
it
until
he
remembered
what
had
happened
to
his
leather
hat
so
instead
he
began
systematically
to
hack
at
the
bushes
with
his
knife
and
tear
them
up
by
the
roots
at
one
given
spot
at
the
end
of
an
hour
he
had
progressed
only
about
a
yard
so
he
gave
this
up
too
he
sat
down
wrapped
his
arms
around
his
knees
gazed
at
the
silver
sky
and
thought
of
nothing
for
a
while
then
he
thought
of
lilla
and
the
baby
kew
here
he
was
presumably
in
cupia
perhaps
within
a
few
stads
of
them
and
yet
what
good
did
it
do
him
it
seemed
to
him
as
though
the
nearer
he
got
to
his
loved
ones
the
more
effectually
he
was
separated
from
them
on
the
farley
farm
in
edgartown
massachusetts
when
he
had
received
the
s
o
s
message
from
the
skies
it
had
appeared
but
a
simple
matter
to
step
within
the
coordinate
axes
of
his
apparatus
and
throw
a
lever
in
order
to
materialize
on
poros
in
vairkingi
there
had
been
the
more
difficult
task
of
securing
an
ant
plane
before
essaying
to
cross
the
boiling
seas
in
the
land
of
the
whoomangs
he
had
been
confronted
with
the
almost
insuperable
lack
of
swathing
materials
for
such
a
flight
and
now
in
cupia
at
last
he
was
hemmed
in
by
an
impenetrable
wall
of
trees
yet
he
reflected
he
had
surmounted
in
turn
each
of
these
successively
more
difficult
difficulties
so
why
not
this
with
renewed
determination
he
arose
and
resumed
his
grubbing
operations
another
hour
passed
and
another
yard
of
path
had
been
completed
this
was
encouraging
and
yet
he
had
no
means
of
knowing
how
much
farther
there
still
remained
for
him
to
go
as
he
paused
for
breath
he
heard
a
crashing
noise
almost
directly
across
the
pit
concealing
himself
as
well
as
he
could
in
the
recess
which
he
had
formed
in
the
bushes
he
watched
expectantly
presently
the
thick
growth
on
the
other
side
parted
neatly
and
the
sharp
edge
of
a
wedge
appeared
this
wedge
continued
to
divide
the
bushes
until
finally
it
came
completely
through
all
curiosity
to
see
what
was
pushing
the
wedge
myles
craned
forward
but
there
was
behind
it
it
had
been
pushing
itself
as
the
bushes
slowly
closed
together
again
the
wedge
stood
up
on
six
sturdy
legs
and
trotted
around
the
top
of
the
pit
until
it
came
to
a
stop
directly
opposite
the
hiding
place
of
the
this
gave
him
a
good
opportunity
to
observe
it
apparently
it
was
some
sort
of
insect
its
head
came
to
a
sharp
cutting
edge
in
the
front
about
five
feet
high
and
lateral
projections
extended
diagonally
backward
from
the
edge
like
the
wings
on
a
to
a
point
well
beyond
the
rear
end
of
the
animal
these
two
sides
were
covered
with
stiff
bristles
which
evidently
served
to
catch
on
the
bushes
through
which
the
creature
passed
and
thus
to
hold
whatever
gains
it
made
its
eyes
like
those
of
a
crab
were
located
on
long
jointed
arms
which
it
could
raise
whenever
it
wanted
to
look
around
the
lower
edge
of
the
sides
of
the
wedge
were
serrated
and
myles
soon
learned
what
this
was
for
after
wiggling
its
eyes
about
for
a
while
the
creature
walked
to
the
edge
of
the
bank
thus
giving
the
watcher
a
good
view
of
the
body
and
legs
within
the
projecting
wedge
and
slid
off
into
the
pit
where
a
splashing
sound
indicated
that
it
was
probably
drinking
soon
it
reappeared
over
the
top
of
the
pit
evidently
the
saw
teeth
on
its
sides
were
to
hold
its
progress
up
the
face
of
the
sand
bank
in
much
the
same
way
as
its
spines
held
its
progress
through
the
bushes
the
wedge
insect
upon
topping
the
bank
made
a
beeline
for
the
edge
of
the
clearing
thrust
its
nose
between
two
saplings
furled
its
eyes
braced
it
feet
against
the
ground
and
started
forcing
its
way
through
quick
as
a
flash
myles
cabot
darted
from
his
hiding
place
and
followed
the
creature
rolling
its
eyes
to
the
rear
saw
him
and
tried
to
back
out
for
what
purpose
he
could
not
tell
but
probably
either
to
attack
him
or
at
least
to
prevent
him
from
attacking
its
vulnerable
body
but
it
was
already
in
too
far
and
its
spines
held
it
securely
it
tried
to
kick
at
him
whereat
he
followed
not
quite
so
close
then
it
stubbornly
stopped
moving
pulled
in
its
eyes
and
its
legs
and
lay
down
within
its
projecting
whereat
he
gave
it
a
prick
in
the
tail
with
his
vairking
sword
the
effect
was
immediate
and
sudden
the
creature
leaped
to
its
feet
and
tore
its
way
through
the
trees
like
a
cyclone
plunging
high
in
air
like
a
frantic
horse
this
left
such
an
erratic
and
only
partially
spread
path
that
the
had
difficulty
in
following
and
soon
fell
far
behind
but
just
as
he
was
about
to
despair
the
branches
which
he
parted
ahead
of
him
revealed
a
meadow
of
sward
he
had
reached
the
end
of
the
wood
beyond
the
field
was
a
grove
of
lichen
trees
through
which
he
could
see
the
steep
roofs
of
a
village
just
short
of
the
grove
there
grazed
a
herd
of
those
aphids
the
size
of
sheep
which
the
cupians
call
anks
and
which
myles
was
wont
to
call
green
close
by
his
right
hand
was
a
large
shrub
with
leaves
unmistakably
a
tartan
bush
steep
red
roofs
gray
lichen
trees
anks
and
tartans
this
must
be
cupia
he
was
home
myles
quoted
aloud
breathes
there
a
man
with
soul
so
dead
who
never
to
himself
has
said
this
is
my
own
my
native
land
cupia
might
not
be
his
land
but
it
was
his
the
land
of
his
wife
and
child
the
land
of
which
his
son
was
rightful
king
the
land
whose
armies
he
had
twice
led
to
victory
and
now
he
had
returned
to
lead
them
yet
again
drawing
a
deep
breath
of
cupian
air
into
his
lungs
myles
raced
across
the
meadow
to
the
shelter
of
the
grove
of
trees
from
that
point
of
vantage
he
inspected
the
village
the
architecture
was
undoubtedly
cupian
in
fact
its
character
was
so
clear
he
was
even
able
to
judge
by
it
just
what
part
of
cupia
he
was
in
for
this
architecture
was
typical
of
the
southeastern
foothills
of
the
okarze
mountains
a
thousand
stads
or
so
north
of
kuana
the
capital
city
these
foothills
held
among
other
spots
of
interest
lake
luno
on
an
island
of
which
he
and
lilla
had
built
their
country
home
and
the
inhabitants
of
these
mountains
had
always
been
intensely
loyal
to
the
his
wife
and
royal
son
on
the
outskirts
of
the
village
cabot
could
see
figures
in
white
togas
with
colored
edges
figures
with
tiny
vestigial
wings
projecting
from
their
backs
figures
with
butterflylike
antennae
rising
from
their
foreheads
these
were
cupians
his
own
adopted
countrymen
yet
they
never
would
recognize
him
in
his
present
condition
with
shaggy
hair
massive
beard
and
leather
tunic
and
without
the
artificial
wings
and
antennae
which
he
had
been
accustomed
to
wear
among
them
therefore
he
could
not
yet
reveal
himself
he
must
first
restore
his
appearance
to
normal
and
also
find
and
put
on
one
of
the
small
portable
radio
sets
which
he
had
contrived
years
ago
in
his
laboratories
of
mooni
in
order
to
talk
with
these
folk
who
have
neither
ears
nor
voice
so
turning
his
back
on
the
alluring
village
he
made
a
meal
of
the
green
milk
of
the
grazing
anks
and
then
set
out
to
circle
the
settlement
and
find
a
road
when
he
did
reach
the
road
he
recognized
it
and
now
he
knew
exactly
what
village
that
was
for
the
moment
he
could
not
recall
its
name
but
he
knew
it
to
be
a
little
town
which
he
and
lilla
had
often
visited
scarcely
twenty
stads
from
luno
castle
as
he
strode
on
toward
luno
castle
his
thoughts
raced
ahead
of
him
sometimes
picturing
a
happy
homecoming
with
lilla
and
baby
kew
standing
in
the
great
arched
doorway
to
greet
him
and
sometimes
desolation
and
destruction
with
prince
yuri
the
murderer
of
the
baby
king
and
the
kidnaper
of
princess
lilla
what
would
myles
cabot
find
on
the
beautiful
island
in
lake
luno
xxiii
luno
and
beyond
with
no
weapons
except
a
steel
knife
and
wooden
rapier
the
unkempt
and
bearded
set
out
resolutely
along
the
road
which
led
to
lake
luno
all
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
he
tramped
along
avoiding
the
towns
and
taking
cover
whenever
a
kerkool
approached
night
velvet
fragrant
night
of
poros
yet
still
he
kept
on
for
he
knew
the
road
as
he
trudged
along
he
tried
to
picture
to
himself
the
state
of
affairs
in
cupia
back
in
vairkingi
when
at
last
he
had
succeeded
in
getting
the
princess
lilla
on
the
air
she
had
mentioned
the
whistling
bees
just
before
prince
yuri
had
cut
her
off
these
bees
were
called
whistling
because
of
the
heterodyne
squeal
with
which
they
appeared
to
converse
but
myles
had
discovered
by
means
of
the
greater
range
and
selectivity
of
his
own
artificial
radio
that
this
whistle
was
due
to
the
bees
sending
simultaneously
on
two
interfering
wave
lengths
for
signal
purposes
when
simply
talking
they
used
a
wave
length
beyond
the
range
of
cupian
speech
cabot
had
been
able
to
adjust
his
portable
set
to
this
wave
length
and
had
talked
with
the
bees
as
a
result
of
this
conversation
an
alliance
had
been
formed
between
cupia
and
the
the
called
had
driven
yuri
and
his
ants
from
the
continent
thereafter
the
bees
had
lived
at
peace
with
the
cupians
a
special
ration
of
green
cows
being
bred
for
their
benefit
what
wondered
cabot
had
the
returned
yuri
done
to
disturb
this
state
of
affairs
if
portheris
the
king
of
the
bees
still
lived
cabot
could
not
imagine
him
siding
with
yuri
but
whatever
had
happened
it
was
clear
that
the
bees
were
at
the
bottom
of
it
time
would
tell
very
speedily
traveling
on
foot
at
night
on
the
planet
poros
is
necessarily
slow
and
tedious
for
the
blackness
of
the
porovian
night
is
dense
beyond
anything
conceivable
on
earth
on
earth
even
the
light
of
a
few
stars
would
enable
a
man
to
distinguish
between
a
concrete
road
and
the
adjoining
fields
and
woods
and
bushes
but
on
poros
no
stars
are
visible
accordingly
myles
had
to
feel
his
way
with
his
feet
and
fell
off
the
road
many
times
before
he
reached
his
destination
due
to
the
mountainous
character
of
the
country
most
of
these
falls
were
extremely
painful
and
some
were
positively
dangerous
yet
on
he
kept
and
before
long
the
lights
of
luno
village
loomed
ahead
even
here
it
would
not
do
to
reveal
himself
in
his
present
state
of
appearance
so
he
skirted
the
town
and
made
his
way
down
the
steep
path
which
led
to
the
shore
of
the
lake
if
his
island
dwelling
had
been
disturbed
he
half
expected
to
find
that
his
boats
were
gone
from
this
landing
place
but
upon
groping
about
in
the
dark
he
came
across
several
of
them
tied
up
just
where
they
ought
to
be
this
cheered
him
immensely
but
when
he
stared
across
toward
the
island
and
saw
no
sign
of
any
light
there
his
spirits
fell
again
it
was
not
the
custom
at
luno
castle
to
go
through
the
night
totally
unillumined
he
would
soon
find
out
what
the
trouble
was
so
stepping
into
one
of
the
boats
he
cast
off
and
paddled
vigorously
toward
the
middle
of
the
lake
keeping
his
bearings
was
difficult
in
the
darkness
but
he
was
guided
somewhat
by
the
faint
illumination
sent
skyward
by
the
little
village
finally
he
bumped
against
the
rocky
and
precipitous
sides
of
the
island
but
misjudging
his
location
he
had
to
paddle
nearly
clear
around
the
island
before
he
came
to
the
landing
beach
this
gained
he
pulled
his
craft
ashore
and
groped
his
way
up
the
narrow
path
to
the
summit
thence
across
the
lawns
which
sloped
gently
down
toward
the
center
of
the
island
where
lay
a
little
pond
with
luno
castle
standing
beside
it
myles
ran
into
several
shrubs
got
completely
mixed
up
as
to
his
directions
and
finally
fell
into
the
pond
this
gave
him
a
new
starting
point
from
which
to
orient
himself
walking
around
its
edge
with
one
foot
in
the
water
he
would
diverge
outward
from
time
to
time
until
at
last
his
groping
hand
touched
a
wall
of
masonry
it
was
his
castle
he
was
home
but
what
did
that
home
hold
his
heart
beat
tumultuously
with
anticipation
feeling
his
way
along
the
wall
he
came
to
the
steps
and
crawled
up
them
to
the
great
arched
doorway
the
door
was
closed
but
not
locked
myles
flung
it
open
softly
and
entered
closing
it
behind
him
then
closing
his
eyes
he
turned
an
electric
switch
flooding
the
hall
with
the
light
of
many
gradually
opening
his
eyelids
he
glanced
around
him
everywhere
was
the
musty
odor
of
unoccupancy
he
had
expected
either
his
family
or
a
sacked
and
ruined
castle
he
had
found
neither
it
would
not
do
for
the
surrounding
populace
to
discover
his
return
until
he
was
ready
so
he
hastily
found
a
flashlight
and
then
switched
off
the
again
in
hand
he
made
a
tour
of
the
castle
everything
was
in
perfect
order
lilla
was
a
good
housekeeper
and
had
evidently
been
given
plenty
of
time
by
yuri
to
prepare
for
her
departure
this
spoke
volumes
for
her
safety
and
that
of
the
baby
king
myles
even
found
his
own
rooms
undisturbed
this
surprised
him
greatly
he
had
not
expected
this
much
consideration
from
yuri
but
then
he
reflected
that
yuri
must
have
been
pretty
sure
that
he
would
not
return
from
the
earth
and
had
wanted
to
do
nothing
to
antagonize
lilla
any
more
than
absolutely
necessary
this
time
yuri
had
been
playing
the
game
of
with
a
little
more
finesse
than
usual
myles
in
his
own
dressing
room
switched
on
the
light
this
was
safe
as
its
windows
opened
only
onto
the
courtyard
then
he
bathed
shaved
trimmed
his
hair
and
donned
a
toga
in
place
of
his
leather
vairking
tunic
on
his
head
he
placed
a
radio
headset
of
the
sort
which
he
had
devised
shortly
after
his
first
advent
on
poros
to
enable
him
to
talk
with
the
earless
and
voiceless
cupians
and
formians
artificial
antennae
projected
from
his
forehead
his
earphones
and
ears
were
concealed
by
locks
of
hair
his
tiny
his
a
fold
of
his
toga
artificial
wings
strapped
to
his
back
protruded
through
slits
in
his
garment
around
his
waist
beneath
his
gown
was
the
belt
which
carried
his
batteries
tubes
and
the
sending
and
receiving
apparatus
itself
thus
equipped
he
surveyed
himself
complacently
in
the
glass
barring
the
absence
of
a
sixth
finger
on
each
hand
and
a
sixth
toe
on
each
foot
he
looked
a
cupian
of
the
cupians
then
he
proceeded
to
the
radio
room
the
long
distance
was
in
perfect
condition
but
there
was
nothing
on
the
air
one
of
the
porovian
clocks
showed
the
time
to
be
that
is
a
half
hour
after
midnight
earth
time
there
was
nothing
further
he
could
do
before
morning
so
he
lay
down
for
a
few
hours
of
much
needed
rest
when
he
awoke
it
was
broad
daylight
o
clock
the
pink
flush
of
sunrise
was
just
fading
from
the
eastern
sky
less
than
three
sleep
and
then
he
realized
that
he
must
have
slept
the
clock
around
and
more
a
day
s
growth
of
beard
confirmed
this
it
was
now
the
beginning
of
his
day
in
cupia
he
had
been
dead
to
poros
for
fifteen
parths
so
he
shaved
bathed
and
breakfasted
on
some
dried
twig
was
all
he
could
find
in
the
house
the
courtyard
garden
was
full
of
weeds
the
lawns
which
surrounded
the
castle
and
the
pond
were
uncut
everything
bespoke
an
abandonment
many
sangths
ago
after
a
complete
tour
of
the
premises
myles
hastened
to
the
radio
room
and
the
palace
at
kuana
the
result
was
the
voice
of
the
usurper
yuri
testily
calling
the
in
new
formia
far
across
the
boiling
seas
from
time
to
time
there
would
be
silence
during
which
the
prince
was
evidently
waiting
for
a
reply
but
none
came
otto
the
bold
had
done
his
work
of
destruction
too
well
myles
chuckled
yuri
s
frantic
voice
coming
in
over
the
air
was
a
radio
program
much
to
cabot
s
liking
even
the
best
of
columbia
national
or
mutual
could
not
surpass
it
the
only
thing
he
would
rather
hear
would
be
his
own
sweet
lilla
his
recollection
of
otto
the
bold
led
him
to
wonder
how
the
battle
for
vairkingi
had
progressed
roies
and
vairkings
on
one
side
against
roies
and
ants
on
the
other
it
was
a
it
seemed
years
since
he
had
left
the
land
of
the
furry
grod
att
jud
theoph
crota
arkilu
they
all
resembled
mere
shadows
of
a
dream
the
only
real
feature
that
stood
out
in
his
memory
was
the
radio
set
which
he
had
fabricated
then
his
thoughts
flew
to
yat
the
city
of
the
whoomangs
with
its
strange
assortment
of
creatures
including
boomalayla
the
winged
dragon
and
queekle
mukki
the
serpent
cabot
shed
a
tear
for
doggo
and
little
golden
furred
quivven
and
then
came
down
to
the
present
with
a
jerk
he
was
back
in
cupia
clean
clothed
shaved
equipped
fed
and
rested
it
was
now
up
to
him
to
rescue
the
princess
lilla
from
her
traitor
cousin
first
he
must
find
firearms
but
of
these
the
castle
had
been
looted
for
not
a
trace
of
a
rifle
an
automatic
or
even
a
single
cartridge
could
he
find
though
he
searched
high
and
low
so
reluctantly
he
strapped
on
merely
his
vairking
sword
and
knife
and
ran
down
the
path
to
the
beach
in
the
boat
once
more
he
paddled
rapidly
toward
the
shore
at
the
landing
place
sitting
on
one
of
the
boats
was
a
cupian
but
as
this
man
seemed
to
be
unarmed
cabot
approached
him
without
fear
as
he
came
within
the
man
sang
out
welcome
back
to
cupia
myles
cabot
defender
of
the
faith
myles
shaded
his
eyes
from
the
silver
glare
of
the
sky
he
exclaimed
for
the
cupian
before
him
was
none
other
than
the
young
cleric
of
the
lost
religion
who
had
helped
rebuild
his
radio
in
the
caves
of
kar
during
the
second
war
of
liberation
as
the
boat
grated
on
the
beach
the
leaped
out
and
the
two
friends
were
soon
warmly
patting
each
other
s
cheek
these
greetings
over
cabot
asked
what
good
fortune
brings
you
here
he
found
it
easy
to
slip
back
again
into
the
language
of
this
continent
the
holy
leader
detailed
two
of
us
replied
to
watch
luno
castle
for
you
know
he
must
be
kept
informed
of
everything
as
he
waits
within
his
caves
for
the
promised
day
night
before
last
my
colleague
saw
lights
for
a
night
so
this
morning
i
decided
to
is
owva
still
holy
leader
myles
asked
politely
yes
the
cleric
replied
the
grand
old
man
still
the
builder
be
praised
but
changing
the
subject
how
are
my
family
both
well
answered
though
for
the
past
six
or
nine
days
the
princess
has
not
been
permitted
to
communicate
with
myles
smiled
why
he
innocently
asked
i
know
not
the
young
cleric
admitted
myles
laughed
i
thought
that
the
holy
leader
knew
everything
he
said
well
as
it
happens
can
tell
it
is
because
i
communicated
with
her
a
few
days
ago
and
informed
her
that
i
was
about
to
return
has
no
news
of
this
got
out
from
the
palace
no
replied
but
it
explains
why
yuri
has
kept
a
large
squadron
of
whistling
bees
patrolling
the
eastern
coast
all
day
long
every
day
how
did
you
get
by
them
came
over
at
night
the
answered
but
what
about
the
bees
i
ll
tell
you
said
shortly
after
you
left
on
your
visit
to
your
own
planet
minos
prince
yuri
flew
back
alone
from
his
exile
with
the
formians
beyond
the
boiling
seas
this
was
the
first
that
we
of
cupia
had
known
that
any
of
them
survived
yuri
kept
his
return
a
secret
for
some
time
but
got
in
touch
with
some
old
supporters
of
his
first
he
contrived
to
cut
off
the
allowance
of
anks
which
are
doled
out
to
the
bees
for
food
then
he
stirred
up
trouble
among
the
bees
because
of
this
the
bees
imprisoned
portheris
their
king
and
under
promise
of
an
increased
allowance
of
food
seized
the
arsenal
at
kuana
the
air
base
at
wautoosa
and
luno
castle
as
you
know
the
air
navy
has
been
practically
disbanded
because
there
was
nothing
for
it
to
fight
the
rifles
of
the
marching
clubs
had
fallen
into
disuse
because
other
newer
games
had
superseded
archery
most
of
the
rifles
were
stored
at
various
central
places
which
the
bees
succeeded
in
seizing
some
of
the
hill
towns
still
had
arms
but
they
surrendered
these
under
threat
of
yuri
to
kill
the
princess
lilla
and
the
little
king
all
the
arms
are
now
stored
in
the
arsenal
at
the
capital
under
guard
of
yuri
s
most
trusted
henchmen
a
new
treaty
was
made
with
the
bees
giving
them
an
increase
in
food
but
even
so
they
are
restive
and
are
held
in
check
merely
by
fear
of
the
guns
at
kuana
the
general
belief
of
the
populace
is
that
you
are
dead
yuri
is
ruling
strictly
and
has
dissolved
the
popular
assembly
the
pinquis
everywhere
are
his
personal
appointees
these
facts
and
the
burden
of
supplying
anks
to
the
hymernians
irk
the
people
but
they
are
impotent
can
a
mathlab
struggle
in
the
jaws
of
a
woofus
lilla
he
treated
well
if
he
had
not
done
so
the
populace
would
rise
against
him
bees
or
no
bees
and
he
has
promised
the
succession
to
little
kew
if
lilla
will
marry
him
but
your
message
many
sangths
ago
stopped
that
for
it
showed
that
you
still
lived
and
had
returned
to
poros
although
not
to
this
continent
that
is
all
now
tell
me
of
your
but
before
complying
with
this
request
the
asked
what
has
become
of
the
loyal
prince
toron
and
my
chief
of
staff
hah
babbuh
and
poblath
the
philosopher
and
all
my
other
friends
and
supporters
every
one
of
them
so
far
as
i
know
is
safe
the
young
cleric
replied
most
of
than
are
hiding
in
the
hill
towns
yuri
has
not
risked
the
wrath
of
the
populace
by
molesting
them
and
in
fact
has
given
notice
that
so
long
as
they
behave
they
will
be
let
then
cabot
related
all
that
had
occurred
to
him
from
the
time
he
transmitted
himself
earthward
through
poros
down
to
the
present
date
when
he
concluded
he
remarked
that
will
be
an
for
the
holy
leader
but
now
to
get
to
work
on
whom
can
i
best
depend
in
this
vicinity
on
emsul
the
veterinary
replied
he
lives
in
the
village
now
return
to
the
island
and
i
will
bring
him
to
myles
did
so
and
in
a
short
time
the
three
were
in
conference
in
the
castle
it
seemed
to
myles
that
the
first
thing
to
do
was
to
recover
his
airplane
rifle
and
ammunition
from
the
waters
of
the
pit
but
emsul
demurred
said
he
huge
inhabit
the
pool
they
are
very
like
the
red
parasites
which
cling
to
the
sides
of
the
anks
and
which
we
roast
for
food
but
they
are
much
larger
and
the
bite
of
their
claws
means
the
parasites
to
which
the
veterinary
alluded
had
always
tasted
to
cabot
exactly
like
lobsters
the
description
of
these
new
beasts
were
further
suggestive
of
lobsters
he
asked
emsul
for
a
more
detailed
description
and
found
that
this
tallied
still
further
with
the
earthly
prototype
this
reminded
myles
of
an
interesting
experiment
which
he
had
seen
tried
in
the
harvard
zoological
laboratory
and
which
he
now
hoped
to
put
to
a
practical
use
so
he
asked
have
these
creatures
a
gravitational
sense
organ
yes
the
cupian
veterinary
replied
although
it
is
unlike
ours
we
cupians
and
i
suppose
you
minorians
have
inside
the
skull
on
each
side
of
the
head
a
group
of
three
tubes
like
the
spirit
levels
of
a
carpenter
the
corresponding
organ
of
the
beast
is
different
although
serving
the
same
end
on
each
side
of
the
thorax
of
these
creatures
there
is
a
spherical
cavity
with
a
small
opening
to
the
outside
this
opening
is
just
large
enough
to
admit
a
grain
of
sand
at
a
time
the
membrane
which
lines
the
cavity
exudes
a
liquid
cement
which
unites
into
a
little
ball
the
grains
of
sand
which
enter
the
cavity
is
lined
with
nerve
ends
and
as
the
ball
always
rolls
to
the
bottom
side
of
the
cavity
the
beast
is
able
to
tell
which
direction
is
up
and
which
is
cabot
clapped
his
hands
in
glee
this
was
exactly
as
in
the
case
of
lobsters
they
won
t
know
which
is
up
and
which
is
down
when
i
get
through
with
them
he
exclaimed
cryptically
it
was
quickly
arranged
that
should
go
at
once
to
the
village
near
the
lobster
pool
and
engage
a
gang
of
cupian
men
to
cut
a
swath
through
the
thick
woods
which
hem
in
the
pool
when
this
was
completed
he
was
to
send
a
messenger
to
luno
castle
to
summon
cabot
who
meanwhile
would
be
engaged
in
preparing
certain
mysterious
electrical
apparatus
for
the
present
the
s
return
was
a
secret
the
plan
worked
to
perfection
only
one
day
was
consumed
in
chopping
the
path
through
the
woods
on
the
second
day
after
his
meeting
with
and
emsul
myles
proceeded
to
the
lobster
pool
by
the
kerkool
with
his
electrical
equipment
and
several
boats
xxiv
the
lobsteroid
circuit
myles
could
not
help
comparing
his
present
ease
of
passage
down
the
swath
cut
by
the
cupians
with
his
difficult
grubbing
through
the
shrubs
a
few
feet
an
hour
or
even
with
forcing
his
way
behind
the
insect
upon
his
arrival
at
the
brink
of
the
abyss
his
first
act
was
to
test
the
black
sand
with
an
electric
coil
as
he
had
expected
it
was
magnetite
the
only
iron
ore
which
will
respond
to
a
magnet
it
was
the
same
ore
as
he
had
used
in
his
crucibles
while
making
his
radio
set
in
vairkingi
this
preliminary
disposed
of
cables
were
quickly
stretched
back
and
forth
across
the
pit
and
from
these
cables
large
were
hung
close
to
the
surface
of
the
water
wires
were
run
from
the
lighting
system
of
the
town
to
a
master
controller
at
the
top
of
the
cliff
when
all
was
in
readiness
the
threw
the
current
into
all
the
circuits
the
result
was
immediate
to
the
surface
of
the
water
there
floated
bottom
side
up
a
score
or
more
of
lobsterlike
creatures
each
the
size
of
a
freight
car
poor
beasts
the
pellets
of
sand
and
cement
in
the
cavities
of
their
organs
were
composed
of
magnetite
and
this
being
attracted
upwardly
by
the
suspended
gave
the
poor
creatures
the
impression
that
up
was
down
and
down
was
up
consequently
reversing
their
position
and
floating
to
the
surface
they
what
little
imagination
their
primitive
brains
were
capable
they
were
resting
peacefully
at
the
bottom
of
the
lake
next
there
were
turned
on
in
place
of
the
suspended
magnets
a
number
of
magnets
lying
against
the
steep
side
of
the
pit
near
the
surface
of
the
water
and
instantly
all
the
lobsteroids
rolled
over
with
their
bellies
toward
that
side
of
the
pit
the
experiment
was
a
complete
success
grappling
hooks
and
blocks
and
tackle
were
then
brought
and
dragging
was
begun
for
the
airplane
the
and
the
bandoleer
of
cartridges
which
myles
had
lost
on
the
night
of
his
landing
in
cupia
the
radio
man
himself
stationed
at
his
switchboard
manipulated
the
instruments
presumably
all
three
of
the
sought
articles
were
near
the
bank
where
cabot
had
landed
so
fishing
was
begun
at
that
point
while
energized
magnets
across
the
pond
drew
the
huge
crustaceans
away
even
so
several
of
them
swam
back
and
snapped
at
the
grappling
hooks
this
gave
myles
an
opportunity
to
practice
his
controls
whenever
one
of
the
monsters
of
the
deep
would
approach
any
of
the
dredging
apparatus
the
radio
man
would
close
the
switch
which
controlled
some
magnet
whereat
the
bewildered
beast
would
be
thrown
completely
off
his
balance
and
would
require
several
paraparths
before
he
could
orient
himself
to
the
new
lines
of
force
by
the
time
that
this
had
been
accomplished
cabot
would
have
switched
on
some
other
magnet
thus
again
upsetting
the
beast
s
equilibrium
it
was
truly
a
weird
and
novel
tune
which
this
electrical
genius
of
two
worlds
played
upon
his
keyboard
while
huge
green
shapes
moved
at
his
command
finally
myles
got
so
expert
at
this
strange
game
that
it
became
safe
for
his
workmen
to
descend
into
the
pit
without
fear
of
the
denizens
of
the
deep
at
last
the
ropes
were
securely
fastened
to
the
and
it
was
drawn
up
the
bank
to
safety
the
and
ammunition
followed
shortly
thereafter
the
forces
of
the
true
now
armed
with
one
small
airship
one
rifle
and
one
bandoleer
of
cartridges
you
must
attack
at
once
asserted
the
looked
at
the
cupian
in
surprise
why
he
asked
because
the
young
cleric
explained
if
you
don
t
some
one
of
this
village
is
going
to
get
word
to
prince
yuri
of
your
return
although
no
announcement
has
yet
been
made
of
your
identity
this
feat
of
yours
of
overcoming
the
is
as
good
as
a
verbal
introduction
runners
will
soon
be
notifying
the
why
runners
myles
asked
why
not
radio
because
replied
i
took
the
precaution
to
throw
an
into
the
local
set
early
this
morning
one
of
the
solenoids
is
hopelessly
jammed
and
it
will
take
several
days
and
nights
of
steady
work
to
restore
great
are
the
ramifications
of
the
lost
religion
cabot
murmured
approvingly
but
the
young
cleric
pouted
in
spite
of
the
tone
of
approval
said
he
there
were
no
ramifications
to
accomplishment
i
did
it
all
have
it
your
own
way
myles
returned
conciliatorily
but
to
get
back
to
what
we
were
discussing
how
am
i
to
attack
the
usurper
with
no
troops
and
only
one
plane
and
one
rifle
but
you
attack
objected
as
for
planes
every
plane
in
the
kingdom
save
only
yours
is
under
lock
and
key
at
wautoosa
the
old
naval
air
base
which
now
is
the
headquarters
of
the
whistling
bees
every
firearm
save
two
your
rifle
and
prince
yuri
s
automatic
is
under
heavy
guard
at
the
kuana
arsenal
only
the
pretender
himself
and
the
arsenal
are
trusted
henchmen
of
permitted
to
be
and
i
suppose
the
interjected
with
a
shrug
that
you
expect
me
alone
and
to
seize
the
kuana
arsenal
and
distribute
arms
to
my
not
exactly
the
priest
replied
you
at
which
point
the
conversation
was
interrupted
by
a
body
of
troops
four
abreast
which
came
marching
toward
them
down
the
aisle
which
had
been
cut
through
the
trees
cabot
stepped
back
aghast
trapped
the
soldiers
swung
along
in
the
perfect
cadence
which
had
been
taught
them
by
generations
spent
in
the
marching
hundreds
cupia
true
they
were
unarmed
but
what
could
one
armed
human
do
against
such
numbers
cabot
glanced
down
the
path
and
saw
hundred
after
hundred
turn
into
it
at
the
farther
end
there
was
only
one
possibility
of
escape
his
plane
but
the
plane
was
still
dripping
from
its
submergence
in
the
pond
would
its
start
while
wet
had
enough
water
leaked
into
the
alcohol
tanks
to
damage
the
fuel
he
would
see
shouting
to
and
emsul
to
follow
he
started
toward
his
craft
but
the
young
cleric
blocked
his
way
treachery
no
for
the
young
priest
cried
fear
not
defender
of
the
faith
these
be
friends
they
are
the
armies
which
you
are
to
lead
against
yuri
they
are
marching
clubs
of
the
loyal
hill
towns
which
have
been
called
together
here
ostensibly
for
an
athletic
cabot
stopped
his
mad
scramble
of
retreat
and
smiled
with
such
men
he
would
reconquer
cupia
yuri
or
no
yuri
bees
or
no
bees
the
foremost
hundred
debouched
and
formed
in
then
from
the
ranks
there
stepped
a
cupian
who
snatched
off
his
blond
wig
revealing
ruddy
locks
beneath
onto
his
own
right
breast
he
pinned
a
red
circle
the
insignia
of
field
marshal
it
was
hah
babbuh
chief
of
staff
of
the
armies
of
cupia
who
had
been
cabot
s
man
in
the
two
wars
of
liberation
facing
the
troops
he
gave
a
crisp
command
up
shot
every
left
hand
then
wheeling
about
he
held
his
own
hand
aloft
and
shouted
yahoo
myles
cabot
we
are
ready
to
follow
where
you
lead
yahoo
the
troops
echoed
in
unison
then
giving
his
men
the
order
at
ease
hah
strode
up
to
the
warmly
the
two
friends
patted
each
other
on
the
cheek
it
was
many
sangths
since
they
had
seen
each
other
and
much
had
happened
in
the
meantime
a
council
of
war
was
immediately
held
between
myles
hah
and
emsul
at
the
plane
won
t
this
gathering
come
to
the
attention
of
yuri
myles
asked
and
won
t
he
at
once
suspect
its
cause
in
view
of
its
nearness
to
luno
castle
and
in
view
of
my
recent
radio
announcements
from
vairkingi
i
doubt
it
the
babbuh
replied
for
we
have
wrecked
every
radio
set
in
the
but
this
did
not
reassure
the
as
much
as
it
might
it
would
seem
to
me
he
asserted
that
this
very
fact
would
put
prince
yuri
on
his
possibly
so
ruefully
admitted
but
it
will
take
four
days
for
investigators
to
cover
the
thousand
stads
from
kuana
to
here
by
kerkool
two
days
by
and
in
the
meantime
myles
countered
it
will
take
our
plane
two
days
to
reach
kuana
and
our
kerkools
then
emsul
suggested
had
we
not
better
march
openly
and
at
once
this
suggestion
was
accepted
with
the
reservation
however
that
the
return
of
cabot
and
the
existence
of
their
plane
were
to
be
kept
as
secret
as
possible
accordingly
the
main
body
of
the
troops
were
put
on
the
march
toward
kuana
under
emsul
with
instructions
to
requisition
every
available
kerkool
wreck
every
radio
set
and
place
every
settlement
under
martial
law
the
kerkools
as
fast
as
seized
were
to
be
manned
by
the
best
sharpshooters
and
sent
ahead
the
local
village
and
the
lobster
pond
were
placed
under
heavy
guard
and
the
with
his
plane
and
rifle
remained
under
cover
that
night
just
at
sunset
he
started
forth
the
airship
had
been
stripped
to
its
lightest
and
in
it
were
crowded
myles
cabot
hah
babbuh
and
half
a
dozen
sharpshooters
long
before
morning
they
came
up
with
the
lights
of
the
foremost
kerkools
and
so
were
forced
to
cease
their
advance
whereupon
they
landed
and
encamped
for
the
rest
of
the
night
and
the
following
day
all
day
long
kerkools
passed
them
on
the
road
stopping
to
report
as
they
passed
apparently
a
surprising
number
of
these
swift
porovian
autos
had
been
captured
the
following
night
the
plane
again
took
wing
and
continued
until
it
caught
up
once
more
with
the
advance
guard
of
the
these
men
reported
that
at
the
last
radio
station
seized
they
had
learned
that
prince
yuri
had
put
censorship
on
the
air
thus
showing
conclusively
that
the
usurper
had
learned
something
of
what
was
going
on
then
the
kerkools
swept
ahead
and
cabot
encamped
as
before
he
was
now
halfway
to
kuana
his
loved
ones
and
prince
yuri
toward
the
end
of
the
day
which
followed
the
advancing
kerkools
met
a
bombing
squadron
of
whistling
bees
and
were
forced
to
halt
and
take
cover
as
best
they
could
most
of
the
men
escaped
but
many
of
the
machines
had
to
be
left
on
the
road
where
they
were
demolished
by
the
bombs
of
the
enemy
during
all
this
confusion
a
kerkool
from
the
capital
bearing
crossed
sticks
as
a
flag
of
truce
drew
up
at
the
vanguard
with
the
following
message
king
yuri
can
not
but
regard
the
steady
procession
of
kerkools
toward
kuana
as
a
menace
directed
against
him
if
it
is
not
so
intended
then
let
a
delegation
in
one
kerkool
proceed
under
crossed
sticks
to
convince
him
of
your
sincerity
from
now
on
if
more
than
one
kerkool
advances
it
will
be
taken
as
a
hostile
act
and
prince
kew
the
heir
to
the
throne
will
be
sacrificed
as
a
upon
receiving
this
message
emsul
at
once
directed
his
followers
to
stay
where
they
were
until
myles
cabot
should
catch
up
with
them
then
with
a
picked
body
of
men
in
one
kerkool
under
crossed
sticks
he
took
up
the
road
toward
kuana
preceded
by
the
delegation
which
had
brought
the
message
from
yuri
not
a
word
would
he
give
them
as
to
the
purpose
of
the
advance
your
message
was
from
prince
yuri
he
said
and
therefore
to
prince
yuri
shall
be
the
reply
but
it
does
seem
a
bit
thoughtless
of
the
hymernians
to
drop
bombs
on
our
men
before
even
attempting
to
ascertain
whether
or
not
our
advance
was
intended
to
be
to
this
they
in
turn
made
no
answer
about
midnight
myles
cabot
in
his
airplane
reached
the
point
where
the
kerkools
had
halted
he
found
the
cupians
confused
and
more
or
less
leaderless
he
as
they
was
horrified
at
the
threat
which
the
usurper
yuri
held
over
the
head
of
the
little
king
but
while
he
and
and
hah
babbuh
were
conferring
on
the
situation
word
was
brought
in
by
a
party
who
had
just
demolished
a
radio
set
that
they
had
picked
the
following
unaddressed
and
unsigned
message
out
of
the
air
fear
not
baby
kew
has
been
kidnaped
from
the
palace
and
is
safe
somehow
this
news
carried
conviction
the
longer
they
considered
it
the
more
authentic
it
appeared
certainly
it
could
not
have
emanated
from
yuri
for
he
could
have
no
possible
object
in
deceiving
them
into
thinking
that
the
little
king
was
safe
and
thus
encouraging
them
to
proceed
with
whatever
they
might
have
afoot
but
they
could
not
imagine
who
was
their
informant
it
might
be
any
one
of
a
number
of
the
leaders
in
cabot
s
two
wars
of
liberation
poblath
the
philosopher
mango
of
the
kuana
jail
ja
babbuh
oya
buh
and
buh
tedn
professors
at
the
royal
university
count
kamel
of
ktuh
the
or
even
the
loyal
prince
toron
yuri
s
younger
brother
whom
cabot
had
left
in
charge
as
regent
upon
embarking
on
his
visit
to
the
earth
all
these
loyal
cupians
had
been
driven
into
hiding
when
the
renegade
yuri
had
returned
across
the
boiling
seas
and
had
usurped
the
throne
with
the
aid
of
the
hymernians
where
they
now
were
no
one
knew
this
message
might
be
from
any
one
of
it
might
not
anyhow
it
served
to
hearten
cabot
and
his
two
companions
said
myles
undoubtedly
there
were
some
of
yuri
s
cupian
henchmen
on
the
backs
of
the
bees
which
bombed
our
kerkools
these
have
probably
reported
by
wireless
that
our
advance
has
stopped
i
do
not
believe
that
yuri
yet
knows
that
we
have
a
plane
accordingly
he
will
not
expect
immediate
trouble
so
long
as
our
vanguard
remains
here
four
hundred
stads
from
kuana
you
hah
babbuh
remain
here
in
charge
of
our
troops
i
seriously
doubt
if
the
usurper
will
attack
you
for
he
does
not
dare
trust
enough
cupians
with
rifles
for
that
purpose
and
i
and
our
sharpshooters
will
proceed
as
rapidly
as
possible
in
the
plane
until
daybreak
when
we
will
encamp
as
usual
afternoon
send
scouts
ahead
to
destroy
the
wireless
and
start
your
whole
kerkool
army
on
the
move
at
sunset
bend
every
effort
to
join
me
as
soon
as
possible
at
the
capital
where
i
expect
to
arrive
some
time
night
beyond
that
i
have
no
definite
plans
may
the
great
builder
speed
our
then
he
said
and
took
off
once
more
in
his
plane
as
he
soared
aloft
with
his
noisy
would
have
heard
it
for
stads
in
every
direction
but
these
cupians
were
earless
and
hence
possessed
no
sense
of
hearing
as
we
know
it
the
noisy
plane
could
make
no
impression
upon
their
for
its
engines
being
of
the
trophil
diesel
as
we
call
a
somewhat
similar
device
on
no
electrical
ignition
throughout
the
remainder
of
the
night
the
plane
sped
southward
deviating
from
its
course
only
when
whistling
sounds
warned
them
of
the
presence
of
bees
with
the
first
faint
tinge
of
pink
in
the
east
they
landed
and
hid
their
airship
at
the
edge
of
a
wood
two
hundred
and
sixty
stads
from
kuana
a
small
town
lay
near
by
to
it
went
several
of
the
crew
in
search
of
food
and
information
while
the
rest
took
turns
guarding
the
plane
and
sleeping
during
cabot
s
turn
at
watch
he
noted
a
figure
slinking
across
a
neighboring
field
there
was
something
strangely
familiar
about
this
figure
so
myles
hid
himself
in
a
tartan
bush
and
awaited
its
approach
it
walked
with
a
peculiar
limp
very
much
like
that
which
had
characterized
buh
tedn
ever
since
he
recovered
from
the
shell
wound
which
he
had
received
in
the
second
war
of
liberation
but
the
face
and
the
hair
of
the
approaching
cupian
bore
no
resemblance
to
that
of
professor
tedn
nevertheless
cabot
took
a
chance
stepping
suddenly
from
his
place
of
concealment
he
shouted
buh
tedn
thereat
the
cupian
emitted
a
shriek
of
terror
from
his
antennae
and
started
running
away
across
the
fields
stop
the
called
i
am
myles
the
fleeing
man
halted
abruptly
and
peered
at
myles
inquisitively
then
he
smiled
and
snatched
off
his
wig
and
straightened
out
his
expression
it
was
none
other
than
buh
tedn
so
you
are
the
cause
of
all
the
rumpus
he
ejaculated
returning
and
patting
his
friend
warmly
on
the
cheek
what
rumpus
miles
inquired
with
interest
wireless
won
t
work
the
other
replied
and
no
messages
on
the
air
anyhow
nothing
but
bees
the
air
is
full
of
full
of
vague
rumors
of
all
sorts
as
poblath
would
say
where
there
s
wind
there
s
a
storm
speaking
of
poblath
myles
said
where
the
philosopher

the
last
i
heard

replied
ja
babbuh
and
oya
buh

somewhere
in
the
west

disappeared
completely
hah

to

the
northern
part
of

of
my
unarmed
forces
one
hundred
and
sixty
stads
north
of

on
his
way
to

rifle
the

and

the
idea

the
idea
is
to
fly
to
kuana
the
replied
and
raise
as
much
as
possible
for
prince
yuri
will
you
come
with
us
there
is
one
vacant
place
in
the
the
cupian
looked
at
him
admiringly
and
said
you
are
still
the
same
old
myles
cabot
you
propose
to
capture
kuana
practically
without
arms
and
and
the
joke
is
that
you
will
probably
succeed
how
you
do
it
it
s
a
gift
myles
laughed
but
trees
have
antennae
as
poblath
would
say
let
us
proceed
to
the
plane
and
wait
for
at
the
plane
cabot
awakened
one
of
the
cupians
to
take
his
place
on
guard
then
in
low
tones
he
and
buh
tedn
each
related
to
the
other
all
that
had
occurred
since
the
apparatus
had
shot
the
radio
man
earthward
along
toward
night
the
absentees
returned
from
the
village
bringing
provision
but
scarcely
any
news
except
that
the
place
was
seething
with
suppressed
excitement
and
that
they
had
succeeded
in
getting
into
the
radio
station
and
pying
the
apparatus
let
us
start
then
at
once
buh
tedn
counseled
no
one
can
now
get
word
to
yuri
and
perhaps
they
will
mistake
us
for
a
hymernian
but
impatient
as
he
was
myles
would
hear
none
of
this
they
could
easily
dispatch
a
runner
to
some
town
to
send
the
message
from
there
he
said
furthermore
a
plane
looks
very
little
like
a
whistling
so
the
group
feasted
and
waited
until
the
last
streaks
of
red
had
died
in
the
west
before
they
shot
into
the
air
and
southward
the
plane
was
driven
to
its
utmost
but
it
was
later
than
o
clock
before
the
lights
of
kuana
loomed
ahead
turning
to
the
right
cabot
skirted
the
city
and
landed
near
the
arsenal
promptly
left
them
i
have
church
affairs
to
attend
to
he
explained
great
are
the
ramifications
of
the
lost
religion
the
replied
laughing
and
i
hope
that
you
pick
up
some
useful
after
the
young
cleric
had
gone
buh
tedn
asked
surely
you
don
t
plan
for
us
to
attack
the
arsenal
it
is
heavily
guarded
by
the
only
men
whom
yuri
permits
to
carry
in
this
entire
xxv
all
kinds
of
trouble
we
must
reconnoiter
first
cabot
replied
for
as
yet
i
have
no
definite
accordingly
they
made
their
way
to
a
grove
of
trees
near
the
arsenal
where
they
stood
they
were
completely
enveloped
by
foliage
and
tropical
darkness
but
the
arsenal
was
in
a
flood
of
light
which
emanated
from
large
floodlights
on
poles
a
short
distance
outside
the
surrounding
wall
along
the
top
of
the
high
wall
walked
sentinels
armed
with
rifles
cabot
quickly
formed
his
plans
turning
his
rifle
and
bandoleer
over
to
the
best
shot
in
the
party
he
instructed
the
sharpshooter
as
follows
when
i
raise
my
hand
so
then
shoot
the
sentinel
to
whom
i
am
talking
follow
that
by
a
shot
at
the
nearest
light
then
under
cover
of
the
darkness
slink
across
the
plain
and
join
me
at
the
without
any
further
explanation
he
walked
boldly
out
into
the
light
as
he
approached
the
arsenal
there
rang
out
the
cry
of
halt
he
halted
who
is
there
not
so
loud
he
cautioned
you
see
i
am
unarmed
let
me
approach
near
the
wall
so
that
i
may
explain
my
mission
which
is
for
your
antennae
the
sentinel
signified
his
assent
and
cabot
drew
nearer
halt
the
cupian
on
the
wall
repeated
but
this
time
in
a
low
tone
cabot
halted
again
this
time
almost
directly
under
the
light
stand
where
you
are
said
the
soldier
while
i
let
down
a
ladder
make
any
attempt
to
flee
and
i
shall
myles
remained
where
he
was
with
every
indication
of
extreme
terror
as
the
cupian
let
down
a
rope
ladder
from
the
top
of
the
wall
and
descended
hold
up
your
hands
up
shot
cabot
s
right
hand
it
was
the
signal
agreed
on
with
the
concealed
sharpshooter
the
sentinel
dropped
to
the
ground
without
a
sound
the
light
went
out
hastily
the
exchanged
his
white
toga
for
the
black
toga
of
his
fallen
enemy
and
picked
up
the
latter
s
rifle
and
it
felt
good
to
have
a
real
rifle
in
his
hands
once
more
in
place
of
the
buttless
firearms
of
the
ants
just
then
a
voice
hailed
him
from
the
top
of
the
wall
what
s
the
trouble
out
of
the
dim
twilight
below
myles
called
back
i
shot
a
sutler
and
just
as
i
was
about
to
search
his
body
the
light
went
out
have
you
your
flash
light
with
you
then
come
on
down
and
help
me
the
second
sentinel
eager
for
a
taste
of
sutler
s
food
after
weeks
of
garrison
rations
started
to
scramble
down
the
rope
ladder
but
as
he
neared
the
ground
cabot
stepped
to
his
side
and
put
a
single
bullet
through
his
brain
out
of
the
semidarkness
around
him
there
arose
seven
forms
they
were
buh
tedn
and
the
six
cupian
marksmen
from
the
hills
buh
tedn
started
to
change
clothes
with
the
fallen
guard
but
cabot
stopped
him
saying
no
your
limp
would
give
you
away
let
one
of
the
others
assume
the
personality
of
this
one
of
the
others
made
the
exchange
then
said
their
leader
two
of
the
posts
of
the
guard
are
now
cleared
do
you
marksman
ascend
the
ladder
and
walk
this
beat
impersonating
yuri
s
the
man
did
so
while
those
below
cowered
close
to
the
wall
soon
cabot
heard
a
shot
to
the
extreme
right
of
the
beat
then
a
voice
from
above
called
softly
one
less
guard
o
cabot
three
sections
of
the
wall
are
now
cleared
i
have
the
body
up
myles
and
one
more
sharpshooter
mounted
the
parapet
soon
all
three
were
walking
post
with
the
precision
of
old
practice
while
the
other
five
members
of
the
party
clung
to
the
rope
ladder
under
the
shadow
of
the
wall
cabot
himself
walked
the
leftermost
post
and
took
pains
never
to
meet
the
adjoining
sentry
thus
nearly
half
a
parth
of
time
passed
finally
an
officer
with
a
squad
approached
along
the
top
of
the
wall
to
the
left
cabot
promptly
crowded
to
the
extreme
end
of
his
beat
and
cautioned
his
own
adjoining
sentinel
to
remain
close
at
hand
as
the
squad
drew
near
he
sang
out
halt
the
squad
halted
who
is
there
the
demanded
advance
one
and
be
the
officer
stepped
forward
advance
the
officer
brought
the
relief
forward
halted
it
again
and
called
out
number
four
thereat
one
of
the
squad
stepped
from
the
ranks
at
cabot
himself
came
to
port
in
unison
at
this
point
the
routine
ended
tilting
his
gun
slightly
from
its
position
myles
suddenly
fired
two
shots
and
the
officer
and
the
new
number
four
sank
down
upon
the
parapet
instantly
the
whole
squad
was
in
confusion
but
before
they
could
raise
their
rifles
to
reply
myles
and
his
companions
riddled
them
with
bullets
one
of
them
more
than
the
rest
dropped
prone
without
being
hit
and
then
cautiously
drew
a
bead
on
myles
cabot
who
seeing
his
enemies
all
down
had
just
paused
to
breathe
neither
he
nor
his
companion
saw
his
hostile
move
and
myles
s
other
man
was
walking
his
post
far
to
the
right
in
a
military
manner
so
as
to
attract
no
attention
from
the
guardsmen
farther
on
everything
was
all
set
for
the
tragedy
which
would
forever
put
an
end
to
the
hope
of
the
redemption
of
cupia
from
the
renegade
yuri
and
his
bee
allies
but
just
as
the
soldier
was
about
to
pull
the
trigger
a
brawny
arm
slipped
across
his
throat
and
yanked
him
backward
so
that
his
gun
went
off
in
the
air
it
was
buh
tedn
who
had
crawled
to
the
top
of
the
wall
in
the
rear
of
the
squad
a
shot
from
cabot
s
companion
promptly
put
an
end
to
this
last
enemy
then
the
seven
conspirators
searched
the
bodies
and
equipped
themselves
cabot
pinning
on
the
insignia
of
the
officer
there
were
eight
bodies
but
some
had
undoubtedly
fallen
from
the
wall
in
the
struggle
no
time
could
be
spared
to
hunt
for
these
and
eight
was
more
than
enough
for
the
present
purposes
myles
formed
his
men
in
two
ranks
counted
them
off
faced
them
to
the
right
and
proceeded
along
the
parapet
picking
up
his
one
already
posted
man
as
he
went
number
six
was
relieved
in
true
military
form
he
was
too
glad
of
getting
off
duty
to
notice
the
unfamiliarity
of
the
officer
who
relieved
him
similarly
with
numbers
seven
eight
nine
and
so
on
as
he
came
to
number
eleven
cabot
began
to
worry
for
fear
that
his
supply
of
new
sentinels
might
run
out
why
hadn
t
he
made
some
arrangement
to
have
his
own
men
rejoin
him
after
being
posted
but
then
he
reflected
that
that
would
never
do
for
it
certainly
would
have
been
noticed
by
the
others
he
was
in
a
fix
number
twelve
was
relieved
all
seven
of
his
own
men
were
gone
and
myles
cabot
found
himself
at
the
head
of
a
squad
composed
entirely
of
the
enemy
what
could
he
do
at
number
thirteen
but
just
as
he
was
frantically
turning
this
question
over
in
his
mind
he
came
to
a
long
ramp
leading
inward
from
the
wall
down
to
a
small
building
between
the
wall
and
the
main
arsenal
he
stepped
back
as
though
to
inspect
the
squad
and
they
without
command
marched
past
him
turned
and
proceeded
past
number
one
down
the
ramp
this
was
the
there
were
no
more
sentinels
to
relieve
inside
the
buildings
he
gave
the
commands
dismissed
hands
up
the
last
was
not
in
the
manual
the
tired
men
on
their
way
to
the
gun
rack
stopped
in
surprise
up
shot
their
hands
some
first
dropping
their
rifles
but
some
retaining
them
it
is
cabot
the
minorian
one
of
them
shouted
the
situation
was
ticklish
in
the
extreme
the
cupians
were
scattered
throughout
the
room
so
that
it
was
impossible
for
myles
to
cover
them
all
simultaneously
with
his
rifle
they
were
desperate
characters
thugs
of
the
worst
type
typical
henchmen
of
prince
yuri
if
they
started
any
trouble
myles
could
expect
to
get
one
or
at
most
two
of
the
seven
before
the
rest
would
get
him
furthermore
they
knew
it
back
up
all
of
you
into
that
corner
quickly
he
directed
but
they
did
not
budge
gradually
smiles
began
to
break
over
their
ugly
visages
they
realized
that
they
had
him
at
bay
rather
than
he
them
and
what
a
prize
he
would
be
for
presentation
to
king
yuri
why
the
king
might
even
blow
them
to
a
beefsteak
party
the
confronted
them
unafraid
he
still
had
the
drop
on
them
and
he
intended
to
press
his
advantage
to
the
limit
you
fat
one
over
by
the
rack
back
into
the
corner
he
ordered
or
i
ll
shoot
you
the
cupian
addressed
obeyed
with
alacrity
you
with
the
scar
lay
down
your
gun
now
you
back
into
the
corner
the
second
soldier
did
so
things
were
progressing
nicely
one
by
one
he
could
subdue
the
cupians
confronting
him
but
just
as
he
was
exulting
in
his
triumph
his
gun
was
seized
from
behind
turning
he
saw
number
one
leering
at
him
one
blow
from
his
fist
in
that
leering
face
and
the
newcomer
crashed
to
the
floor
but
before
myles
could
wheel
to
confront
those
in
the
guardroom
they
had
rushed
him
and
borne
him
to
the
ground
capture
him
alive
some
one
shouted
and
that
was
the
last
that
he
heard
for
something
snapped
in
his
portable
radio
set
and
from
then
on
he
was
deaf
to
all
that
he
could
hear
was
an
occasional
rifle
shot
in
spite
of
the
overwhelming
numbers
upon
him
he
fought
with
feet
and
fists
until
at
last
the
weight
seemed
to
lessen
finally
he
struggled
to
his
feet
and
confronted
his
tormentors
could
it
be
that
he
had
vanquished
eight
brawny
cupians
but
no
for
the
figures
he
confronted
were
buh
tedn
and
his
own
men
the
eight
enemies
lay
dead
on
the
floor
the
mutual
congratulations
were
silently
given
a
quick
inspection
showed
that
the
and
the
were
hopelessly
damaged
so
the
radio
man
found
a
stylus
and
paper
and
wrote
my
artificial
antennae
and
the
accompanying
apparatus
were
ruined
during
the
fight
luckily
there
is
another
set
in
the
airplane
one
of
you
go
quickly
and
fetch
one
of
the
party
accordingly
withdrew
the
others
rifle
in
hand
proceeded
to
search
the
building
but
not
a
soul
did
they
find
although
the
couches
had
evidently
been
recently
occupied
it
seemed
likely
that
during
the
struggle
in
the
guardroom
the
rest
of
the
guard
being
unable
to
reach
the
arms
racks
had
stealthily
left
the
building
so
myles
and
his
party
hurried
on
to
the
door
which
led
from
the
building
into
the
arsenal
yard
as
they
emerged
they
were
met
with
a
volley
from
the
arsenal
and
three
of
their
number
went
down
the
rest
beat
a
hasty
retreat
and
barred
the
door
then
they
made
their
way
to
the
windows
which
faced
the
main
arsenal
but
two
more
of
them
were
picked
off
before
they
realized
how
perfectly
they
were
silhouetted
by
the
lighted
rooms
within
one
of
these
two
was
buh
tedn
myles
cabot
and
one
cupian
sharpshooter
were
all
that
were
left
of
the
party
as
rapidly
as
possible
the
two
survivors
extinguished
all
the
lights
in
the
guardhouse
and
then
mounted
to
the
roof
which
was
flat
and
surrounded
by
a
low
parapet
which
protected
them
from
showing
themselves
against
the
illumination
of
the
surrounding
vapor
lamps
crawling
along
the
roof
to
the
edge
nearest
the
arsenal
they
peered
cautiously
over
the
whistle
of
a
bullet
caused
myles
to
duck
his
head
and
he
pulled
his
companion
to
cover
as
well
with
his
artificial
antennae
gone
he
could
not
explain
orally
and
it
was
too
dark
to
write
but
the
other
followed
him
to
the
opposite
edge
where
they
succeeded
in
potting
the
sentinels
at
posts
two
and
three
which
were
the
only
occupied
posts
within
sight
there
appearing
to
be
nothing
further
to
be
accomplished
up
there
they
crawled
down
into
the
building
and
took
up
their
station
at
windows
of
the
upper
story
from
which
they
fired
at
every
sign
of
movement
in
the
direction
of
the
arsenal
taking
care
to
drop
to
the
floor
and
then
change
windows
after
each
shot
finally
their
ammunition
gave
out
and
cabot
went
down
to
the
guardroom
for
more
but
a
long
and
careful
search
revealed
only
a
few
rounds
myles
returned
to
the
upper
story
and
groped
through
the
rooms
to
find
his
friend
but
it
was
his
foot
rather
than
his
hand
which
finally
found
him
the
cupian
sharpshooter
lay
dead
myles
cabot
alone
with
only
about
a
dozen
cartridges
was
the
sole
remaining
defense
of
the
captured
building
no
life
seemed
to
be
stirring
on
the
arsenal
side
so
he
crossed
the
building
and
looked
out
at
the
wall
dark
figures
were
stealthily
creeping
along
where
post
no
should
have
been
the
let
them
have
it
with
rapid
fire
and
they
quickly
disappeared
he
now
heard
firing
in
that
direction
and
then
the
lights
there
went
out
so
that
the
wall
no
longer
showed
against
the
sky
from
time
to
time
he
fired
where
he
judged
the
wall
was
so
as
to
keep
back
the
invaders
and
thus
soon
entirely
exhausted
his
ammunition
thank
heaven
he
said
to
himself
the
downstairs
door
is
barred
but
as
he
said
this
he
realized
that
he
had
omitted
to
bar
the
door
which
opened
toward
the
wall
and
even
as
he
realized
this
there
came
a
rush
of
many
feet
down
the
ramp
which
led
from
the
wall
to
this
door
xxvi
the
debacle
myles
drew
his
knife
crouched
in
a
corner
of
the
dark
room
and
prepared
to
sell
his
life
dearly
he
was
ready
for
searchers
who
might
come
groping
through
the
room
but
he
was
wholly
unprepared
for
the
sudden
switching
on
of
the
electric
lights
as
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
rubbed
his
eyes
he
saw
before
him
and
the
sharpshooter
whom
he
had
sent
back
to
the
plane
to
get
his
second
radio
set
behind
them
in
the
doorway
were
a
score
or
more
of
cupians
snatching
the
new
set
he
fastened
it
in
place
while
the
others
waited
then
articulate
once
more
you
have
come
in
the
nick
of
time
how
did
it
happen
the
young
priest
replied
through
spies
of
our
religion
i
located
oya
buh
he
rounded
up
a
number
of
his
followers
and
we
hastened
hither
the
wall
we
found
unguarded
with
a
rope
ladder
hanging
down
and
at
its
foot
six
dead
soldiers
in
black
togas
we
took
their
arms
and
mounted
the
wall
only
to
be
driven
back
by
my
shots
myles
interjected
not
all
replied
for
some
came
from
the
arsenal
we
could
tell
by
the
flashes
several
of
our
party
were
not
by
you
so
your
conscience
may
feel
we
put
a
stop
to
this
by
shooting
out
all
the
outside
lights
then
we
rushed
the
guardhouse
and
here
we
are
but
where
are
men
dead
the
sadly
replied
even
buh
oya
buh
then
stepped
forward
and
greeted
his
former
chief
yahoo
cabot
he
cried
may
the
dead
rest
beyond
the
waves
we
the
living
have
work
to
do
sky
turns
pink
and
silver
in
the
east
morning
has
come
what
do
you
propose
morning
means
that
the
whistling
bees
will
soon
be
upon
us
myles
answered
we
must
capture
the
arsenal
before
they
the
party
then
took
inventory
of
their
supplies
there
were
rifles
forty
cupians
and
myles
cabot
one
man
was
promptly
sent
to
the
roof
with
crossed
sticks
when
these
were
recognized
men
under
arms
were
marched
up
onto
the
roof
as
well
it
was
considered
advisable
for
cabot
himself
to
keep
under
cover
then
oya
buh
unbarred
the
door
and
stepped
out
an
officer
from
the
arsenal
advanced
to
meet
him
the
two
gravely
patted
each
other
s
cheek
the
officer
whose
rank
was
that
of
pootah
inquired
what
is
the
idea
of
defying
your
king
professor
the
idea
oya
replied
is
that
we
have
come
to
restore
kew
xiii
to
the
throne
and
the
cupians
to
their
proper
dominion
over
the
bees
the
guardhouse
as
you
see
is
manned
by
sharpshooters
fully
armed
a
vast
force
unarmed
but
determined
awaits
outside
the
walls
if
you
surrender
we
shall
spare
your
lives
if
not
we
shall
rush
the
gates
while
our
sharpshooters
pick
off
any
one
who
opposes
and
shall
kill
all
whom
we
find
within
what
say
you
the
pootah
shrugged
his
shoulders
what
is
there
to
say
he
replied
we
surrender
provided
we
are
given
safe
safe
conduct
without
arms
so
the
guard
about
a
hundred
in
number
in
their
black
togas
filed
out
of
the
arsenal
through
the
guardhouse
onto
the
wall
along
it
and
down
the
rope
ladder
the
ladder
was
then
hauled
up
again
the
pootah
looked
around
him
where
is
your
vast
army
he
asked
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
oya
buh
replied
with
a
smile
now
run
along
away
from
here
like
a
good
little
but
the
officer
and
his
followers
started
circling
the
wall
to
investigate
before
he
gained
the
main
gate
however
it
had
been
opened
and
for
all
he
could
tell
the
vast
army
had
passed
inside
a
guard
stationed
there
advised
him
to
get
out
of
rifle
range
as
speedily
as
possible
and
twelve
sentinels
who
by
now
had
manned
the
wall
bore
out
this
menace
so
grumbling
somewhat
the
pootah
led
his
men
off
toward
the
city
thus
did
myles
cabot
and
practically
unarmed
followers
capture
the
kuana
arsenal
from
its
hundred
defenders
straggling
cupians
now
began
to
drift
in
from
the
city
these
were
put
to
work
carting
arms
and
ammunition
out
of
the
arsenal
and
stacking
it
up
in
widely
separated
piles
wherever
cover
could
be
found
every
cupian
who
reported
was
issued
a
rifle
and
a
full
bandoleer
of
cartridges
we
may
perhaps
thus
arm
some
enemies
myles
admitted
but
we
must
take
the
risk
the
majority
will
be
it
was
well
that
they
removed
all
the
ammunition
which
they
could
it
would
have
been
better
if
they
could
have
removed
more
they
all
worked
feverishly
for
half
the
morning
even
taking
the
guards
off
the
wall
for
this
purpose
but
they
had
scarcely
made
a
dent
in
the
supplies
stored
in
the
arsenal
when
a
fleet
of
bees
appeared
on
the
southern
horizon
in
spite
of
the
approaching
menace
myles
and
his
men
continued
to
work
the
hymernians
flew
low
straight
at
the
arsenal
until
a
volley
from
cabot
s
men
brought
down
two
of
them
and
caused
the
rest
to
soar
into
the
sky
whereupon
they
started
dropping
bombs
on
the
arsenal
and
on
the
men
carting
materials
therefrom
naturally
this
put
an
abrupt
end
to
cabot
s
operations
his
men
scattered
as
rapidly
as
possible
and
individually
made
for
the
city
with
small
quantities
of
arms
keeping
to
cover
as
well
as
they
could
cupians
from
kuana
helped
themselves
to
the
rest
and
by
nightfall
the
captured
supplies
were
pretty
well
distributed
the
arsenal
was
a
smoking
ruin
all
through
the
afternoon
the
bees
flying
low
harassed
whoever
they
saw
moving
on
the
streets
especially
such
as
were
carrying
rifles
but
these
retaliated
by
firing
at
all
bees
that
came
within
range
in
spite
of
which
very
few
bees
were
killed
night
brought
a
cessation
of
this
sort
of
warfare
emsul
arrived
and
of
course
at
once
gave
up
the
idea
of
his
projected
peace
mission
to
yuri
he
and
cabot
and
and
oya
buh
spent
the
night
under
heavy
guard
at
separated
points
throughout
the
city
securing
sleep
under
cover
of
the
darkness
many
of
their
followers
foraged
in
the
ruins
of
the
arsenal
and
secured
a
surprising
quantity
of
undamaged
material
being
joined
in
the
morning
by
the
army
in
kerkools
from
the
north
before
daybreak
a
resolute
band
of
several
thousand
loyal
cupians
had
gathered
in
the
streets
and
houses
surrounding
the
palace
and
promptly
at
sunrise
they
launched
an
attack
they
had
expected
to
find
the
palace
guard
unarmed
but
evidently
a
large
quantity
of
the
rifles
and
ammunition
which
had
been
distributed
throughout
the
city
had
found
their
way
to
the
palace
for
the
assault
was
at
once
repulsed
by
heavy
fire
from
the
palace
guards
as
cabot
s
forces
reformed
for
a
second
attack
they
were
deluged
with
explosives
from
above
the
had
evidently
not
returned
to
their
base
at
wautoosa
but
had
spent
the
night
near
by
so
as
to
be
on
hand
to
protect
the
palace
whenever
they
sighted
even
a
small
group
of
cupians
or
wherever
they
had
reason
to
suspect
that
some
building
was
hostilely
occupied
there
they
would
drop
one
of
their
devastating
bombs
cabot
s
forces
were
completely
at
the
mercy
of
the
hymernians
there
was
but
one
thing
to
in
vain
the
and
his
able
lieutenants
tried
to
rally
their
troops
what
was
the
use
in
assembling
when
assembly
was
the
signal
for
a
bomb
from
above
what
was
the
use
of
attacking
the
invincible
bees
myles
cabot
stood
irresolute
in
one
of
the
public
squares
he
was
as
near
to
despairing
as
he
had
ever
been
in
his
many
vicissitudes
on
the
planet
poros
since
his
first
arrival
there
five
ago
oh
if
only
he
had
airplanes
with
which
to
subdue
the
hymernians
as
in
the
days
of
old
almost
was
he
tempted
to
return
to
the
vicinity
of
the
arsenal
ascertain
whether
his
one
plane
was
intact
and
if
so
fly
alone
in
a
last
desperate
attempt
to
give
battle
to
his
winged
enemies
the
more
he
thought
of
the
plan
the
more
it
appealed
to
him
there
seemed
to
be
no
other
way
out
his
bravely
engineered
revolution
had
crumbled
if
he
stayed
where
he
was
he
would
undoubtedly
be
tracked
down
and
put
to
some
ignominious
end
by
the
usurper
how
much
better
then
to
die
bravely
fighting
for
his
lilla
and
his
adopted
country
and
his
baby
he
wondered
where
the
little
darling
had
disappeared
to
at
least
the
infant
king
was
out
of
yuri
s
clutches
so
his
mind
made
up
myles
set
out
on
a
run
for
the
wood
overlooking
the
arsenal
after
a
few
paraparths
he
reached
it
there
stood
his
plane
rapidly
he
went
over
all
the
struts
and
stays
and
engine
parts
everything
appeared
to
be
in
first
class
order
the
fuel
tanks
contained
plenty
of
alcohol
how
this
machine
had
escaped
capture
or
destruction
was
a
marvel
but
probably
the
bees
had
been
too
busy
bombing
groups
of
cupians
to
take
the
time
to
explore
the
apparently
deserted
grove
myles
sprang
aboard
and
was
just
about
to
start
the
trophil
engine
when
a
familiar
sound
smiting
upon
his
earthborn
ears
caused
him
to
delay
for
a
moment
from
the
southward
came
the
purr
of
many
motors
was
the
wish
the
father
to
the
thought
his
longing
for
an
air
fleet
with
which
to
vanquish
the
bees
had
been
so
intense
had
it
affected
his
mind
and
caused
him
to
hear
things
which
did
not
exist
impossible
for
the
purr
of
the
motors
was
unmistakable
he
strained
his
eyes
toward
the
southern
horizon
so
that
they
might
see
what
his
ears
heard
but
there
was
nothing
there
the
radiant
silver
sky
was
untouched
save
by
an
occasional
small
cloud
the
bees
still
kept
up
their
bombing
of
the
city
he
could
see
them
flying
low
over
the
housetops
and
up
and
down
the
principal
thoroughfares
ferreting
out
any
groups
of
cupians
who
dared
to
gather
in
cabot
s
cause
dropping
bombs
on
any
houses
which
presumed
to
fly
the
blue
pennant
of
the
kew
dynasty
in
place
of
the
yellow
of
yuri
the
bees
did
not
heed
the
approaching
planes
from
the
south
of
course
not
for
the
whistling
bees
of
poros
had
no
ears
they
heard
with
their
antennae
and
heard
only
radio
waves
at
that
in
fact
only
radio
waves
the
noise
of
a
large
fleet
of
airships
swept
on
out
of
the
south
nearer
and
nearer
it
came
until
it
was
right
over
the
city
and
still
not
a
single
plane
appeared
in
sight
meanwhile
the
bees
continued
their
depredations
and
the
sat
in
his
own
plane
and
watched
and
waited
as
he
watched
he
saw
one
of
the
bees
who
happened
to
be
flying
higher
than
the
rest
suddenly
vanish
in
a
puff
of
smoke
and
then
another
and
another
the
hymernians
too
saw
this
and
rose
to
investigate
whereat
there
came
the
whir
of
descending
planes
fascinated
myles
stared
into
the
sky
whence
came
these
sounds
and
saw
occasionally
against
gathering
clouds
a
glint
of
silver
light
several
more
of
the
ascending
bees
exploded
and
now
myles
was
able
to
see
from
time
to
time
silhouetted
on
a
background
of
cloud
the
ghostly
form
of
an
airship
the
bees
too
saw
and
flew
to
the
attack
what
was
this
shadow
fleet
had
the
spirits
of
the
brave
cupian
aviators
of
the
past
returned
to
free
their
beloved
country
from
hymernian
domination
the
two
fleets
bees
and
ghostly
planes
had
now
completely
joined
battle
and
were
drifting
slowly
to
the
southeast
myles
came
out
of
his
trance
started
his
engine
and
rose
into
the
air
intent
on
joining
the
fray
on
his
way
he
circled
over
the
city
and
gave
it
a
glance
in
passing
then
he
gave
it
a
second
glance
for
the
cupians
relieved
of
the
menace
of
the
bees
were
forming
for
a
second
attack
on
the
palace
instantly
his
plans
changed
what
business
had
he
running
off
to
watch
however
interesting
a
sky
battle
when
right
here
before
him
lay
a
chance
to
do
what
he
had
braved
so
many
misfortunes
to
accomplish
namely
free
his
lilla
from
the
unspeakable
yuri
veering
sharply
he
landed
on
one
of
the
upper
terraces
of
the
palace
he
still
wore
his
bandoleer
of
cartridges
and
still
carried
his
rifle
filling
the
magazine
he
boldly
descended
into
the
building
no
one
guarded
the
approaches
from
the
air
for
they
depended
on
their
aerial
allies
to
do
that
for
them
the
upper
rooms
were
deserted
doubtless
because
the
womenfolk
were
cowering
in
the
basements
and
because
the
palace
guards
and
yuri
s
other
henchmen
were
resisting
the
attack
of
cabot
s
cupians
at
the
ground
levels
cabot
himself
explored
the
place
unimpeded
and
unchallenged
here
he
was
at
last
at
his
journey
s
end
but
where
was
lilla
lilla
the
princess
lilla
of
the
golden
curls
his
lilla
the
rooms
which
he
and
she
had
occupied
showed
every
sign
of
continued
and
present
occupancy
even
to
the
crib
of
the
baby
king
emblazoned
with
the
arms
of
the
house
of
kew
cabot
looked
reverently
around
the
living
rooms
of
his
wife
and
child
and
then
swept
on
into
the
lower
levels
of
the
palace
occasionally
he
would
come
upon
groups
of
defenders
but
they
naturally
assuming
that
he
was
one
of
as
he
still
wore
the
black
toga
of
the
arsenal
him
but
little
heed
whenever
the
group
was
not
too
numerous
he
would
shoot
them
he
hated
to
do
this
but
he
knew
he
had
to
in
order
to
save
his
loved
ones
thus
he
traversed
practically
the
whole
of
the
upper
reaches
of
the
palace
without
encountering
his
arch
enemy
yuri
or
any
of
the
womenfolk
yuri
was
no
coward
however
much
of
a
scoundrel
he
might
be
no
one
would
ever
accuse
him
of
that
therefore
he
was
not
in
hiding
he
was
apparently
not
in
command
of
the
defense
therefore
he
must
be
either
away
from
the
palace
or
concocting
some
devilment
figuring
thus
cabot
continued
to
descend
to
levels
below
the
ground
floor
while
treading
these
subterranean
passages
searching
ever
searching
for
either
lilla
or
yuri
he
came
upon
one
of
the
palace
guards
the
fellow
was
unarmed
so
cabot
did
not
shoot
instead
he
ordered
up
with
your
the
guard
promptly
obeyed
now
said
his
captor
the
price
of
your
life
is
to
lead
me
to
your
indeed
i
will
with
pleasure
the
soldier
replied
with
a
sneer
for
king
yuri
will
make
short
work
of
one
who
turns
traitor
to
his
black
the
smiled
i
am
no
traitor
he
announced
and
this
black
toga
is
mere
borrowed
fur
do
you
not
know
cabot
the
minorian
the
other
blanched
good
builder
he
exclaimed
we
did
not
believe
the
story
that
you
had
returned
from
the
planet
minos
but
i
am
at
your
orders
for
i
am
one
of
the
old
guard
who
served
under
king
kew
the
twelfth
the
father
of
princess
lilla
may
he
rest
beyond
the
lead
on
and
no
treachery
myles
curtly
replied
i
trust
no
one
who
has
ever
worn
the
livery
of
prince
so
the
guard
led
the
way
through
many
winding
passages
down
into
the
very
bowels
of
the
subterranean
labyrinths
of
the
palace
what
could
prince
yuri
be
doing
way
down
here
unless
he
was
hiding
which
seemed
unlikely
cabot
became
very
suspicious
and
rifle
in
hand
and
finger
on
trigger
watched
his
guide
with
eagle
eye
finally
they
came
upon
a
form
in
an
elaborate
yellow
toga
huddled
in
a
corner
king
yuri
said
the
soldier
laconically
at
the
sound
of
the
voice
the
usurper
looked
around
and
now
it
became
evident
that
he
was
crouching
there
not
for
fear
but
rather
because
he
was
engaged
in
repairing
something
with
a
set
of
typical
porovian
tools
apparently
not
at
all
surprised
he
hailed
his
deadliest
enemy
and
rival
as
though
the
latter
were
a
long
lost
friend
yahoo
cabot
the
minorian
i
rather
expected
you
would
turn
up
sooner
or
later
just
a
minute
until
i
fix
this
wire
and
then
i
will
be
at
your
service
you
see
one
of
my
mines
wouldn
t
explode
no
one
else
seemed
able
to
get
at
the
cause
of
the
trouble
and
so
i
had
to
come
down
here
in
and
so
saying
he
turned
back
to
his
work
myles
stepped
forward
to
see
what
prince
yuri
was
doing
for
a
brief
moment
the
s
scientific
curiosity
got
the
better
of
his
caution
but
that
moment
brief
as
it
was
proved
long
enough
for
the
watchful
soldier
who
had
led
him
hither
to
snatch
myles
rifle
from
his
hand
and
cover
him
with
its
muzzle
up
with
your
hands
the
soldier
peremptorily
commanded
cabot
obeyed
not
to
do
so
would
have
been
suicide
yuri
still
unperturbed
remarked
well
done
tobo
you
shall
be
promoted
for
shall
i
shoot
him
sire
tobo
eagerly
asked
the
usurper
ruminated
waving
his
antennae
thoughtfully
not
just
now
wait
until
i
finish
with
this
wire
in
the
meantime
you
might
let
the
minorian
lean
against
the
wall
so
that
he
will
be
more
so
myles
leaned
against
the
wall
and
waited
his
hands
still
held
high
while
the
prince
puttered
around
in
the
corner
finally
after
a
seemingly
interminable
period
yuri
arose
slung
his
tools
together
brushed
one
hand
against
the
other
and
looked
at
his
victim
with
a
cruel
smile
shall
i
kill
him
now
asked
tobo
no
i
am
reserving
that
pleasure
for
myself
the
prince
replied
then
to
cabot
at
last
you
are
in
my
power
i
intend
to
shoot
you
myself
i
intend
to
shoot
you
down
turning
to
tobo
the
prince
asked
how
is
our
battle
going
very
well
sire
the
soldier
replied
we
are
repulsing
all
assaults
in
spite
of
the
departure
of
the
bees
to
the
a
momentary
cloud
of
doubt
spread
over
the
sinister
handsome
visage
of
prince
yuri
then
he
smiled
and
said
doubtless
the
bees
know
what
they
are
about
and
will
soon
return
to
the
fray
so
let
us
proceed
with
the
execution
follow
me
myles
followed
almost
was
he
tempted
to
spring
upon
his
enemy
and
attempt
to
throttle
him
before
the
inevitable
bullet
from
tobo
could
do
its
work
it
would
be
well
worth
the
sacrifice
of
his
own
life
to
rid
cupia
of
this
incubus
but
what
if
yuri
should
survive
no
it
would
never
do
to
risk
this
so
he
meekly
followed
the
prince
led
the
way
up
several
levels
until
they
came
to
a
small
circular
chamber
hung
with
curtains
at
one
side
was
a
dais
an
electric
on
the
ceiling
furnished
the
light
prince
yuri
took
the
rifle
from
the
guard
stood
myles
in
the
center
of
the
room
and
sat
down
himself
on
the
dais
then
he
directed
tobo
go
and
summon
the
princess
lilla
hither
for
i
wish
her
to
see
me
kill
this
lover
of
hers
this
beast
from
another
myles
winced
at
the
mention
of
his
beloved
and
thereat
his
tormentors
smiled
the
soldier
departed
on
his
errand
yuri
toyed
with
the
weapon
and
watched
his
victim
with
a
sneer
on
his
handsome
lips
myles
returned
his
stare
without
flinching
you
can
put
down
your
hands
now
if
you
wish
you
mathlab
the
prince
remarked
cabot
did
so
and
instinctively
felt
of
his
face
the
insult
was
unwarranted
for
he
had
shaved
only
that
morning
don
t
go
too
far
he
admonished
his
captor
remember
poblath
s
proverb
you
can
not
kill
a
minorian
i
ve
a
mind
to
kill
you
right
now
the
prince
replied
just
to
prove
to
you
that
your
friend
is
go
ahead
and
try
it
myles
challenged
half
hoping
that
yuri
would
take
him
at
his
word
and
thus
spare
lilla
the
pain
of
attending
the
execution
a
grim
look
settled
on
the
usurper
s
face
as
he
slowly
raised
the
rifle
and
pointed
it
at
the
s
right
side
left
side
myles
admonished
remember
that
my
heart
is
on
the
other
side
than
is
the
case
with
you
my
but
you
are
a
cool
one
yuri
admired
shifting
his
arm
as
directed
now
are
you
prepared
to
die
yes
myles
replied
it
all
seemed
like
a
dream
it
couldn
t
be
possible
that
he
was
really
going
to
die
on
the
planet
venus
perhaps
all
his
adventures
in
the
skies
had
been
a
mere
dream
and
he
was
now
about
to
be
awakened
thus
do
i
bring
peace
to
poros
the
cupian
sententiously
declaimed
his
finger
closed
upon
the
trigger
the
rifle
spat
fire
xxvii
peace
on
poros
myles
felt
a
sharp
warm
pain
in
his
shoulder
but
he
still
stood
erect
he
was
not
dead
could
it
be
that
yuri
had
missed
shaking
himself
together
and
blinking
his
eyes
myles
stared
at
the
prince
the
prince
stared
back
with
an
expression
of
surprise
his
eyes
were
fishlike
his
body
was
no
longer
erect
the
rifle
lay
in
his
lap
and
he
seemed
to
be
feebly
trying
to
raise
it
and
point
it
at
cabot
then
with
a
gurgle
some
blood
welled
from
the
prince
s
mouth
and
trickled
down
his
chin
with
one
supreme
effort
his
antennae
radiated
the
words
curse
you
then
the
rifle
dropped
clattering
from
his
nerveless
hands
and
his
body
slouched
forward
prone
on
the
floor
at
the
foot
of
the
dais
from
the
right
side
of
his
back
there
protruded
the
jewelled
hilt
of
a
dagger
behind
the
couch
between
parted
curtains
stood
a
cupian
woman
her
face
hideous
with
hate
and
triumph
for
a
moment
myles
stood
rooted
to
the
spot
then
tearing
his
feet
free
he
rushed
to
his
fallen
enemy
and
plucked
out
the
dagger
from
the
wound
there
gushed
bright
blood
foamy
with
white
bubbles
myles
turned
the
body
over
and
listened
at
the
right
side
of
the
chest
not
a
sound
then
the
prince
s
chest
collapsed
with
a
sigh
a
little
more
blood
welled
out
of
the
mouth
and
all
was
still
once
more
prince
yuri
the
most
highly
developed
specimen
of
cupian
a
renegade
traitor
rejected
wooer
of
the
princess
lilla
pretender
to
the
throne
of
yuri
was
dead
and
such
an
ignominious
death
for
one
of
his
high
spirit
to
die
stabbed
in
the
back
by
a
woman
cabot
rose
and
faced
her
the
jeweled
dagger
still
in
his
hand
who
are
you
he
asked
and
why
did
you
do
it
i
am
okapa
she
replied
in
a
strained
okapa
from
the
mountain
village
of
pronth
do
you
remember
how
in
the
second
war
of
liberation
you
found
luno
castle
deserted
and
a
slain
infant
lying
on
the
royal
bier
can
i
ever
forget
it
he
answered
his
mind
going
back
into
the
past
naturally
i
thought
it
was
my
baby
son
whom
i
had
never
seen
therefore
i
fought
all
the
harder
against
the
usurper
yuri
until
i
drove
him
and
his
ant
allies
southward
rejoined
lilla
in
kuana
and
learned
that
little
kew
was
safe
and
that
the
dead
child
was
but
an
orphan
baby
whom
lilla
had
substituted
for
our
own
baby
for
fear
of
just
such
an
it
was
no
orphan
okapa
shrieked
it
was
the
dead
child
was
mine
yuri
stabbed
my
child
and
now
i
have
stabbed
him
with
the
selfsame
dagger
yuri
killed
my
baby
and
i
have
slain
him
and
now
i
must
die
myself
for
killing
a
so
saying
her
anger
spent
she
flung
herself
upon
the
couch
and
wept
silently
as
is
the
habit
of
cupians
just
then
the
princess
lilla
in
a
black
gown
swept
into
the
room
they
told
me
the
king
wished
to
see
me
here
she
said
where
is
the
king
she
stopped
abruptly
as
she
saw
the
body
on
the
floor
then
her
eyes
rose
until
they
rested
on
myles
cabot
with
a
glad
cry
she
rushed
toward
his
outstretched
arms
but
a
peremptory
shout
of
hands
up
from
the
doorway
caused
her
to
halt
she
was
between
myles
and
the
door
he
still
held
the
jeweled
dagger
in
his
hand
stepping
quickly
to
one
side
he
cast
it
straight
at
tobo
who
stood
by
the
entrance
a
rifle
in
his
hands
and
before
the
cupian
soldier
could
raise
his
weapon
to
fire
the
missile
had
penetrated
his
heart
down
he
went
with
a
crash
while
this
had
been
going
on
okapa
the
madwoman
had
crept
stealthily
toward
yuri
s
body
with
a
view
to
securing
the
rifle
which
he
had
dropped
seizing
it
she
leaped
to
her
feet
with
a
shriek
you
too
she
cried
pointing
at
lilla
with
one
skinny
finger
for
it
was
you
who
took
my
babe
from
the
orphanage
and
exposed
him
to
danger
you
are
joint
murderer
with
yuri
him
i
have
slain
and
now
it
is
your
but
myles
stepped
between
her
and
the
princess
and
wrenched
the
gun
from
her
poor
mad
hands
whereat
she
flung
herself
upon
him
clawing
and
biting
like
a
demon
it
was
only
the
work
of
a
few
minutes
however
to
get
both
her
wrists
behind
her
back
lilla
sensing
the
need
ripped
some
strips
from
the
hanging
draperies
together
they
tied
the
woman
and
seated
her
to
one
side
then
once
more
the
long
separated
and
his
cupian
beloved
started
to
embrace
while
okapa
glared
at
them
with
baleful
eyes
this
was
too
much
for
myles
just
one
paraparth
he
said
and
stepping
over
to
okapa
he
spun
her
around
until
she
faced
the
wall
then
he
clasped
his
princess
to
him
in
a
long
embrace
but
at
last
a
pang
intruded
in
his
bliss
lilla
dearest
he
asked
where
is
our
little
son
she
shook
herself
together
i
know
not
she
replied
they
would
not
let
me
know
for
fear
that
the
he
rest
beyond
the
force
the
secret
from
me
but
our
country
is
more
important
than
our
child
while
we
tarry
here
the
battle
rages
quick
to
the
upper
levels
and
let
us
take
we
can
not
do
so
without
a
message
from
their
king
her
husband
asserted
let
us
therefore
bring
them
stooping
down
he
picked
up
the
dead
body
of
prince
yuri
and
flung
it
across
his
shoulder
lead
on
he
said
as
they
emerged
up
a
flight
of
stairs
into
the
main
hall
of
the
palace
they
saw
a
frantic
throng
of
palace
guards
piling
tables
chairs
and
other
furniture
into
a
barricade
across
one
of
the
doorways
evidently
the
troops
of
emsul
and
hah
babbuh
had
penetrated
the
palace
and
had
driven
the
defenders
back
to
this
point
the
lilla
standing
straight
and
slim
in
her
black
gown
stopped
all
this
work
of
fortification
with
an
imperious
gesture
desist
she
cried
i
your
princess
command
it
the
war
is
over
yuri
the
usurper
is
prove
it
snarled
back
the
guards
like
a
pack
at
bay
recoiling
from
her
regal
presence
here
is
your
proof
myles
cabot
shouted
stepping
forward
and
casting
yuri
s
body
down
before
them
your
king
is
tis
true
one
replied
the
king
is
yuri
is
dead
another
echoed
long
live
king
kew
long
live
king
kew
shouted
all
the
palace
thugs
just
as
the
besiegers
stormed
over
the
barricade
with
leveled
rifles
but
at
the
shouts
within
and
at
the
sight
of
their
princess
and
their
intrepid
leader
they
grounded
their
arms
and
holding
their
left
hands
aloft
gave
the
porovian
greetings
yahoo
myles
cabot
our
regent
has
returned
from
minos
to
rule
over
us
then
one
guardsman
had
an
idea
come
he
said
let
us
mount
to
the
upper
terraces
haul
down
the
yellow
pennant
of
king
yuri
and
restore
the
red
banner
of
the
kew
from
one
of
the
balconies
above
came
a
boyish
voice
it
has
already
been
done
myles
every
one
looked
up
and
there
stood
yuri
s
younger
brother
the
loyal
prince
toron
wearing
the
insignia
of
admiral
of
the
cupian
air
navy
i
hope
you
don
t
mind
myles
he
said
as
he
descended
i
made
myself
admiral
on
my
own
hook
you
see
while
all
the
bees
were
here
at
kuana
bombing
your
men
i
captured
the
air
base
at
wautoosa
with
a
crowd
of
whom
i
had
assembled
for
that
purpose
we
had
been
hiding
in
the
woods
for
several
sangths
with
spies
at
wautoosa
to
inform
us
when
there
was
an
opening
when
the
time
came
we
walked
right
in
killed
a
few
old
bees
who
were
on
guard
reconditioned
the
planes
which
have
lain
in
storage
ever
since
my
brother
seized
the
throne
painted
them
with
silver
paint
flew
up
here
to
kuana
and
put
the
bees
out
of
business
the
silver
paint
was
my
own
idea
and
i
must
say
it
seemed
to
work
the
bees
couldn
t
see
us
at
all
against
the
silver
sky
the
plaza
and
the
fields
beyond
are
strewn
with
dead
and
dying
hymernians
and
my
men
are
tracking
down
the
and
he
would
have
chattered
on
in
his
boyish
excitement
had
not
one
of
the
soldiers
brutally
interrupted
with
thy
brother
lies
dead
o
the
young
prince
followed
the
pointing
finger
of
the
guard
until
his
eyes
rested
on
the
crumpled
body
in
its
yellow
toga
then
he
flung
his
arm
across
his
face
to
blot
out
the
sight
for
a
few
moments
he
stood
thus
while
all
respectfully
kept
silent
at
last
he
uncovered
his
eyes
and
addressed
the
may
he
rest
beyond
the
waves
he
said
i
crave
the
corpse
so
that
i
can
give
my
brother
a
decent
he
shall
be
buried
with
full
royal
honors
myles
cabot
replied
for
he
was
a
brave
and
regal
cupian
who
would
have
served
his
country
well
if
his
inordinate
ambition
had
not
blinded
his
my
cousin
shall
have
royal
burial
echoed
the
princess
lilla
it
would
be
due
you
toron
for
your
share
in
the
victory
if
for
no
other
i
appreciate
this
courtesy
more
than
words
can
express
toron
replied
the
news
of
the
capitulation
had
rapidly
spread
and
the
huge
hall
was
filling
with
cupians
from
without
among
them
came
emsul
hah
babbuh
oya
buh
and
even
poblath
the
philosopher
warm
were
the
greetings
between
the
friends
but
where
is
our
king
myles
asked
as
soon
as
he
could
free
himself
from
all
the
congratulation
now
it
can
be
told
poblath
replied
he
is
safe
in
the
care
of
my
wife
bthuh
in
our
villa
at
the
darling
i
shall
go
to
him
at
once
lilla
announced
and
i
too
myles
added
but
no
hah
babbuh
interposed
for
the
populace
are
already
gathering
in
the
stadium
and
are
demanding
a
speech
from
the
great
so
be
it
myles
said
with
a
shrug
of
resignation
affairs
of
state
can
not
wait
even
the
presence
of
the
king
it
but
shall
these
guards
be
permitted
to
retain
their
arms
emsul
asked
why
not
the
replied
their
only
crime
is
that
they
fought
loyally
for
their
leader
besides
this
is
a
free
country
one
of
our
grievances
against
the
usurper
was
that
he
deprived
us
of
our
then
to
the
palace
soldiery
care
tenderly
for
the
body
of
prince
yuri
and
lay
it
out
in
state
pending
our
return
oh
and
i
almost
is
a
crazy
woman
bound
in
one
of
the
cellar
rooms
turn
her
over
to
the
mango
of
kuana
for
incarceration
in
the
mangool
and
under
peril
of
your
lives
do
not
permit
her
to
all
hail
our
regent
and
our
most
beautiful
and
beloved
princess
shouted
the
guards
as
myles
and
lilla
left
the
palace
a
kerkool
awaited
them
at
the
gate
getting
into
this
they
proceeded
at
a
slow
rate
through
the
city
and
across
the
plaza
toward
the
stadium
through
lanes
of
cheering
cupians
prince
toron
emsul
hah
babbuh
oya
buh
and
others
of
their
retinue
followed
them
the
plaza
and
the
fields
beyond
were
strewn
with
in
the
once
great
race
of
the
hymernians
one
of
these
bees
as
they
passed
it
gave
sign
of
still
possessing
some
life
a
faint
whistling
noise
assailed
the
antennae
of
the
passing
procession
cabot
gave
one
look
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
then
signed
the
kerkools
to
stop
dismounted
and
approached
the
dying
creature
adjusting
his
control
to
the
wave
length
of
bee
speech
he
sadly
said
portheris
once
my
friend
whom
i
made
king
of
the
bees
it
grieves
me
to
see
you
lying
thus
struck
down
in
a
war
against
my
raising
himself
feebly
the
dying
portheris
replied
i
bear
you
no
malice
myles
cabot
and
i
pray
that
you
will
bear
me
none
although
i
opposed
the
war
yet
when
it
came
to
a
fight
of
race
against
race
i
was
loyal
to
my
own
as
any
honorable
individual
would
have
been
under
like
circumstances
perhaps
it
is
just
as
well
for
do
you
not
remember
that
when
you
were
driving
the
off
the
face
of
cupia
you
said
there
is
no
room
on
any
given
planet
for
more
than
one
race
of
intelligent
beings
now
the
last
formian
is
gone
and
the
last
of
my
own
people
is
gone
may
cupia
be
at
peace
it
is
the
sincere
wish
of
your
old
the
huge
bee
fell
back
quivered
a
moment
and
lay
still
thus
died
portheris
the
last
of
the
hymernians
may
you
rest
beyond
the
waves
dear
friend
the
murmured
as
he
returned
sadly
to
his
car
they
found
the
stadium
packed
with
cheering
throngs
in
gala
attire
everywhere
fluttered
flags
of
the
kew
dynasty
after
lilla
had
been
comfortably
seated
and
marshal
hah
and
the
others
had
arrived
myles
stepped
to
the
transmitter
and
was
about
to
broadcast
some
appropriate
remarks
to
the
assembled
multitude
when
an
airplane
arrived
overhead
and
settled
softly
into
the
arena
from
the
plane
there
stepped
poblath
the
philosopher
followed
by
bthuh
his
dark
and
beautiful
wife
both
were
smiling
and
bthuh
held
in
her
arms
a
baby
cupian
then
cabot
spoke
into
the
microphone
behold
your
king
it
was
the
shortest
speech
he
had
ever
the
best
thus
came
kew
xiii
into
his
own

is
not
much
more
to
tell
prince
toron
retained
his
title
of
admiral
of

hah
babbuh
was
restored
to
his
professorship

physician
owva
the
holy
leader
died
shortly
after
this
and
was
selected
by
the
great
white
lodge
as
the
fit
person
to
reestablish
the
lost
religion
publicly
throughout
cupia
myles
and
lilla
leaving
their
friends
to
reconstruct
the
capital
departed
for
a
vacation
at
luno
castle
thus
end
the
story
of
the
adventure
of
myles
cabot
the
radio
man
on
his
return
to
the
silver
planet
venus
as
received
by
the
harvard
scientists
and
myself
over
the
long
distance
at
my
farm
on
chappaquiddick
island
massachusetts
ralph
milne
farley
the
radio
planet
when
myles
cabot
inventor
of
radio
transmission
of
matter
returned
to
venus
he
found
himself
alone
on
an
unknown
continent
on
that
alien
planet
to
get
back
to
his
old
headquarters
and
his
loved
ones
presented
some
apparently
impossible
problems
he
d
have
to
settle
a
war
between
the
natives
and
an
unholy
alliance
of
monsters
dinosaurs
and
giant
insects
he
d
have
to
build
an
electronic
device
from
raw
rocks
and
untapped
resources
and
if
he
could
succeed
in
all
that
he
d
still
have
to
find
his
way
home
and
fight
off
a
usurper
s
diabolic
conspiracy
but
myles
cabot
didn
t
know
the
meaning
of
the
word
impossible
on
the
wrong
side
of
venus
on
venus
the
radio
planet
nothing
was
impossible
it
seemed
to
myles
cabot
he
was
beginning
to
get
used
to
the
dangerous
monsters
that
inhabited
the
planet
to
know
how
to
deal
with
them
and
the
even
stranger
intelligent
insects
among
whom
he
found
himself
but
the
insects
were
his
enemies
a
race
of
creatures
cabot
had
driven
from
their
dominion
over
cabot
s
own
here
he
was
fighting
side
by
side
with
the
insect
leaders
in
a
desperate
attempt
to
defend
their
queen
it
was
strange
unexpected
but
it
was
the
only
hope
he
had
of
getting
back
to
his
own
land
and
rescuing
the
beautiful
lilla
his
young
son
and
his
throne
