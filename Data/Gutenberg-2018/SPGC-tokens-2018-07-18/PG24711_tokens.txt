i
prudy
patchwork
i
am
going
to
tell
you
something
about
a
little
girl
who
was
always
saying
and
doing
funny
things
and
very
often
getting
into
trouble
her
name
was
prudy
parlin
and
she
and
her
sister
susy
three
years
older
lived
in
portland
in
the
state
of
maine
though
every
summer
they
went
to
willowbrook
to
visit
their
grandmother
at
the
very
first
of
our
story
susy
was
more
than
six
years
old
and
prudy
was
between
three
and
four
susy
could
sew
quite
well
for
a
girl
of
her
age
and
had
a
stint
every
day
prudy
always
thought
it
very
fine
to
do
just
as
susy
did
so
she
teased
her
mother
to
let
have
some
patchwork
too
and
parlin
gave
her
a
few
calico
pieces
just
to
keep
her
little
fingers
out
of
mischief
but
when
the
squares
were
basted
together
she
broke
needles
pricked
her
fingers
and
made
a
great
fuss
sometimes
crying
and
wishing
there
were
no
such
thing
as
patchwork
one
morning
she
sat
in
her
doing
what
she
thought
was
a
she
kept
running
to
her
mother
with
every
stitch
saying
will
that
do
her
mother
was
very
busy
and
said
my
little
daughter
must
not
come
to
me
so
prudy
sat
down
near
the
door
and
began
to
sew
with
all
her
might
but
soon
her
little
baby
sister
came
along
looking
so
cunning
that
prudy
dropped
her
needle
and
went
to
hugging
her
o
little
sister
cried
she
i
would
have
a
horse
come
and
eat
you
up
for
any
thing
in
the
world
after
this
of
course
her
mother
had
to
get
her
another
needle
and
then
thread
it
for
her
she
went
to
sewing
again
till
she
pricked
her
finger
and
the
sight
of
the
wee
drop
of
blood
made
her
cry
o
dear
i
wish
somebody
would
pity
me
but
her
mother
was
so
busy
frying
doughnuts
that
she
could
not
stop
to
talk
much
and
the
next
thing
she
saw
of
prudy
she
was
at
the
farther
end
of
the
room
while
her
patchwork
lay
on
the
spice
box
prudy
prudy

to

prudy
o

prudy
made

and
soon

then
her

laughed

he
when

had

parlor
and

into
that
hogshead
mother
dropped
me
in
and
i
going
to
stay
there
till
i
make
a
bedquilt
only
i
coming
out
to
eat
you
know
parlin
laughed
but
just
then
the
dinner
bell
rang
and
when
they
went
to
the
table
prudy
was
soon
so
busy
with
her
roasted
chicken
and
custard
pie
that
she
forgot
all
about
the
patchwork
chapter
ii
prudy
going
up
to
heaven
prudy
soon
tired
of
sewing
and
her
mother
said
laughing
if
grandma
read
has
to
wait
for
somebody
little
fingers
before
she
gets
a
bedquilt
poor
grandma
will
sleep
very
cold
indeed
the
calico
pieces
went
into
the
and
that
was
the
last
of
prudy
patchwork
one
day
the
children
wanted
to
go
and
play
in
the
new
house
which
was
not
quite
done
parlin
was
almost
afraid
little
prudy
might
get
hurt
for
there
were
a
great
many
loose
boards
and
tools
lying
about
and
the
carpenters
who
were
at
work
on
the
house
had
all
gone
away
to
see
some
soldiers
but
at
last
she
said
they
might
go
if
susy
would
be
very
careful
of
her
little
sister
i
dare
say
susy
meant
to
watch
prudy
with
great
care
but
after
a
while
she
got
to
thinking
of
something
else
the
little
one
wanted
to
play
catch
but
susy
saw
a
great
deal
more
sport
in
building
block
houses
now
i
know
ever
so
much
more
than
you
do
said
susy
i
used
to
wash
dishes
and
scour
knives
when
i
was
four
years
old
and
that
was
the
time
i
learned
you
to
walk
prudy
so
you
ought
to
play
with
me
and
be
goody
then
i
will
but
them
blocks
is
too
big
susy
if
i
had
chop
i
go
get
little
prudy
trotted
off
and
susy
never
looked
up
from
her
play
and
did
not
notice
that
she
was
gone
a
long
while
by
and
by
parlin
thought
she
would
go
and
see
what
the
children
were
doing
so
she
put
on
her
bonnet
and
went
over
to
the
new
house
susy
was
still
busy
with
her
blocks
but
she
looked
up
at
the
sound
of
her
mother
footsteps
where
is
prudy
said
parlin
glancing
around
i
up
to
heaven
cried
a
little
voice
overhead
they
looked
and
what
did
they
see
prudy
herself
standing
on
the
highest
beam
of
the
house
she
had
climbed
three
ladders
to
get
there
her
mother
had
heard
her
say
the
day
before
that
she
did
want
to
shut
up
her
eyes
and
die
and
be
all
deaded
up
she
meant
to
have
her
hands
and
face
clean
and
go
up
to
heaven
on
a
ladder
o
thought
the
poor
mother
she
is
surely
on
the
way
to
heaven
for
she
can
never
get
down
alive
my
darling
my
darling
poor
susy
first
thought
was
to
call
out
to
prudy
but
her
mother
gave
her
one
warning
glance
and
that
was
enough
susy
neither
spoke
nor
stirred
parlin
stood
looking
up
at
her
stood
as
white
and
still
as
if
she
had
been
frozen
her
trembling
lips
moved
a
little
but
it
was
in
prayer
she
knew
that
only
god
could
save
the
precious
one
while
she
was
begging
him
to
tell
her
what
to
do
a
sudden
thought
flashed
across
her
mind
she
dared
not
speak
lest
the
sound
of
her
voice
should
startle
the
child
but
she
had
a
bunch
of
keys
in
her
pocket
and
she
jingled
the
keys
holding
them
up
as
high
as
possible
that
prudy
might
see
what
they
were
when
the
little
one
heard
the
jingling
she
looked
down
and
smiled
you
goin
to
let
me
have
some
cake
and
in
the
china
closet
me
and
susy
parlin
smiled
such
a
smile
it
was
a
great
deal
sadder
than
tears
though
prudy
did
not
know
that
she
only
knew
that
it
meant
yes
o
then
i
coming
right
down
i
like
cake
and
i
wo
go
up
to
heaven
till
then
she
walked
along
the
beam
and
turned
about
to
come
down
the
ladders
parlin
held
her
breath
and
shut
her
eyes
she
dared
not
look
up
for
she
knew
that
if
prudy
should
take
one
false
step
she
must
fall
and
be
dashed
in
pieces
but
prudy
was
not
wise
enough
to
fear
any
thing
o
no
she
was
only
thinking
very
eagerly
about
crimson
jellies
and
fruit
cake
she
crept
down
the
ladders
without
a
thought
of
danger
no
more
afraid
than
a
fly
that
creeps
down
the
the
air
was
so
still
that
the
sound
of
every
step
was
plainly
heard
as
her
little
feet
went
pat
pat
on
the
ladder
rounds
god
was
taking
care
of
her
yes
at
length
the
last
round
was
reached
she
had
got
down
she
was
safe
thank
god
cried
parlin
as
she
held
little
prudy
close
to
her
heart
while
susy
jumped
for
joy
exclaiming
we
got
her
we
got
her
o
ai
you
so
happy
mamma
o
mamma
what
you
crying
for
said
little
prudy
clinging
about
her
neck
ai
i
your
little
comfort
there
now
you
know
what
you
about
you
said
you
get
some
cake
and
verserves
for
me
and
susy
chapter
iii
prudy
susy
felt
as
if
she
had
been
sadly
to
blame
and
for
a
long
time
was
very
watchful
of
her
little
sister
your
name
is
susy
said
the
child
and
your
middle
name
is
and
you
take
the
care
o
me
no
i
do
thought
susy
to
herself
if
i
had
taken
any
care
of
you
at
all
you
would
have
climbed
those
ladders
when
prudy
was
four
years
old
she
teased
to
go
to
school
and
her
mother
decided
to
let
her
go
until
she
grew
tired
of
it
o
dear
sighed
susy
the
first
day
she
took
her
she
talk
out
loud
i
just
about
know
she
will
she
such
a
little
poh
no
i
sha
said
prudy
i
ai
a
susy
parlin
but
you
are
i
sha
talk
in
school
nor
i
sha
whisper
never
in
my
world
when
they
got
home
that
night
parlin
asked
if
prudy
had
whispered
in
school
no
i
never
done
such
a
thing
i
guess
did
i
susy
how
much
i
talk
to
you
do
you
know
o
she
was
good
mother
said
susy
but
she
cried
once
so
i
had
to
go
out
with
her
now
susy
parlin
you
me
to
cry
she
mamma
she
said
if
i
cry
she
give
me
a
piece
of
her
doughnut
susy
blushed
and
her
mother
looked
at
her
and
said
i
would
like
to
see
you
alone
a
little
while
susy
then
parlin
had
a
talk
with
susy
in
the
parlor
and
told
her
how
wrong
it
was
to
deceive
and
how
she
must
take
the
care
of
her
little
sister
and
set
her
good
examples
susy
said
she
would
do
as
well
as
she
could
but
mamma
if
you
are
willing
i
rather
not
sit
with
prudy
now
certainly
she
says
such
queer
things
why
she
said
she
had
grandma
rheumatism
in
her
back
and
wanted
me
to
look
at
her
and
see
if
she
had
why
mother
as
true
as
i
live
she
shut
up
her
eyes
and
put
out
her
tongue
right
there
in
school
and
of
course
we
girls
could
help
laughing
well
perhaps
she
better
sit
by
herself
replied
parlin
smiling
i
will
speak
to
the
teacher
about
her
carrying
her
that
may
keep
her
out
of
mischief
now
it
happened
that
grandma
read
had
taken
a
great
deal
of
pains
to
teach
prudy
to
knit
but
such
a
piece
of
work
as
the
child
made
of
it
the
first
time
she
carried
the
thing
which
she
supposed
was
going
to
be
a
stocking
the
a
b
c
scholars
looked
very
much
surprised
for
none
of
them
knew
how
to
knit
prudy
said
poh
i
know
how
to
do
it
just
as
easy
but
in
trying
to
show
them
how
smart
she
could
be
she
knit
so
fast
that
she
dropped
a
stitch
every
other
moment
there
now
you
are
dropping
stitches
like
every
thing
said
lottie
palmer
very
much
pleased
i
guess
i
know
how
to
do
poh
them
nothing
but
the
said
prudy
but
it
was
not
long
before
she
broke
the
yarn
short
off
and
got
her
work
into
such
a
fix
that
she
had
to
take
it
home
and
ask
grandma
to
fix
it
out
why
child
where
the
ball
said
her
grandmother
and
here
two
needles
gone
o
i
left
to
school
i
said
prudy
i
sure
i
never
noticed
i
found
the
ball
under
the
teacher
desk
said
susy
well
there
now
replied
prudy
it
all
now
and
i
put
it
where
it
where
that
asked
grandma
laughing
well
i
do
know
answered
prudy
trying
to
think
but
i
guess
it
parlin
began
to
think
it
was
a
foolish
plan
to
let
prudy
take
her
i
was
going
to
mention
something
she
did
the
last
day
she
carried
it
she
got
tired
of
knitting
tired
of
twisting
her
pretty
curls
round
her
finger
and
tired
of
looking
at
pictures
let
guess
riddles
she
whispered
to
nancy
glover
who
sat
on
the
bench
beside
her
i
can
make
up
riddles
just
as
easy
something
in
this
room
in
miss
parker
goes
now
guess
that
that
a
riddle
i
wish
you
behave
prudy
parlin
said
nancy
here
i
am
trying
to
get
my
spelling
lesson
then
nancy
turned
her
head
a
little
to
one
side
and
went
to
studying
as
hard
as
she
could
for
it
was
almost
time
for
her
class
to
be
called
all
at
once
prudy
happened
to
look
at
nancy
ear
and
thought
what
funny
little
holes
folks
have
in
their
ears
i
they
go
clear
through
i
guess
i
put
my
right
through
ear
while
she
the
needle
will
look
so
funny
stickin
out
at
the
other
end
so
prudy
was
very
sly
about
it
and
said
not
a
word
but
began
to
push
in
the
needle
with
all
her
might
o
such
sharp
screams
as
nannie
gave
the
teacher
was
frightened
but
when
she
found
that
nannie
was
not
so
badly
hurt
after
all
she
felt
easier
about
her
and
began
to
talk
to
little
prudy
asking
her
why
she
did
sit
still
like
a
lady
and
prudy
began
to
cry
i
said
she
of
course
i
was
i
never
knew
was
to
hurt
her
miss
parker
smiled
and
said
well
you
need
bring
that
here
any
more
the
next
thing
we
should
have
put
out
when
miss
parker
called
out
the
next
class
in
spelling
nannie
sat
with
her
head
down
feeling
very
cross
i
do
like
you
prudy
said
she
you
killed
me
i
pay
you
for
this
now
you
see
miss
parker
had
to
call
nannie
by
name
before
she
would
go
to
her
class
she
was
three
or
four
years
older
than
prudy
and
ought
to
have
known
better
than
to
be
angry
with
such
a
little
child
she
should
have
forgotten
all
about
it
that
would
have
been
the
best
way
but
instead
of
that
she
kept
thinking
o
how
that
did
hurt
prudy
ought
to
be
ashamed
pay
her
for
it
now
you
see
you
may
be
sure
prudy
did
not
worry
her
little
brains
about
it
at
all
her
mother
was
brushing
her
hair
next
morning
for
school
and
parlin
said
do
you
think
she
too
little
to
go
to
school
mother
i
care
about
her
learning
to
read
yet
awhile
parlin
smiled
in
a
droll
way
i
should
be
very
sorry
myself
to
have
prudy
learn
to
read
replied
she
but
she
wo
keep
still
long
enough
you
need
be
a
bit
afraid
look
here
prudy
exclaimed
parlin
can
you
spell
any
words
poh
yes

guess

replied
prudy
her
eyes
looking
very
bright

laughed
parlin

her

papa

to
spell
cat
but
i
can
spell

just

kit

i
can

the
big

the
best
what

said
parlin
the
truth
is
prudy
knew
eight
letters
when
she
began
to
go
to
school
and
now
she
knows
but
four
glad
of
it
returned
parlin
are
you
ready
for

little
one
and
he
held
out
his
arms
saying
and
now
my
own
dear
little
girl
there
is
no
way
but
this
put
your
arms
about
my
neck
and
give
me
one
sweet
kiss
so
prudy
hugged
and
kissed
her
father
just
as
hard
then
she
and
susy
trudged
along
to
school
and
they
met
nancy
glover
who
was
carrying
something
in
her
apron
may
i
see
what
you
got
said
little
prudy
not
till
i

said
nancy
who
stuck
that
into
my
ear
you
know
she
did
mean
to
said
susy
i
do
care
cried
nancy
it
prudy
felt
very
sorry
i
wish
i
had
hurt
you
nanny
said
she
i
want
to
see
what
you

your
apron

i
guess

enough
i
brought
it
to

for
you
o
did
you
cried
the
child
how
good
you
are
nanny
i
love
you
as
well
as
i
do
susy
when
little
prudy
spoke
so
sweetly
nancy
did
know
what
to
say
so
she
said
nothing
they
went
into
the
and
took
their
seats
nancy
keeping
the
corner
of
her
apron
rolled
up
all
the
while
by
and
by
when
miss
parker
was
hearing
the
third
class
nancy
whispered
look

prudy
parlin
you
wanted
to
know
what
i
had
in
my
apron
shall
i
show
you
now
o
goody
well
then
continued
nanny
your
mouth
and
shut
your
eyes
and
i
give
you
something
to
make
you
wise
so
prudy
opened
her
mouth
as
wide
as
it
would
go
and
squeezed
her
eyelids
together
very
hard
then
what
should
nancy
do
but
take
out
of
her
apron
wee
bit
of
a
and
drop
it
in
prudy
mouth
i
ca
see
how
she
dared
do
such
a
thing
but
she
did
it
she
had
found
the
toad
in
the
street
and
picked
it
up
to
frighten
little
prudy
the
moment
the
toad
was
dropped
on
the
child
tongue
of
course
it
began
to
hop
prudy
hopped
too
she
seized
her
tongue
with
one
hand
and
the
toad
with
the
other
screaming
at
the
top
of
her
voice
the
scholars
were
all
frightened
to
hear
such
a
scream
and
to
see
prudy
running
out
to
the
teacher
so
fast
do
tell
me
what
ails

miss
parker
by

time

she
i
did

a
toad
till

miss
parker

prudy
trembling
and
sobbing
it

the
house

in
my
mouth
right
here
on
my
tongue
prudy
showed
miss
parker
her
tongue
miss

laughed
thinking

a
very
funny
child
i
heard
before
now
of
little
folks
having
frogs
in
their
throats
said
she
is
that
what

i
guess
so
sobbed
prudy
and
it
was
alive
just
as
alive
as
could
be
o
o
nancy
she
told
me
to
shut
up
my
eyes
you

and
i
did
see
the
toad
till
it
hopped
right
up
in
my
mouth
and
i
did
see
it
o
o
nancy

miss
parker
sternly
what

her
fingers
in
her
mouth
but
did
not

you
drop
a
toad
into

nancy
sulkily

she
stuck
a
into

that
toad
nancy

miss
parker
struck
nancy
with
a
piece
of
whalebone
and
hurt
her
a
good
deal
it
was
the
only
way
to
make
nancy
remember
not
to
do
such
a
cruel
trick
again
when
prudy
saw
how
much
nancy
was
hurt
it
was
more
than
her
tender
heart
could
bear
she
ran
up
to
miss
parker
and
caught
hold
of
the
skirt
of
her
dress
hiding
her
head
in
it
o
miss
parker
said
she

place
it
was

in
the
third
place
the
whole

going
to
willowbrook
on
a
visit

very
pleasant
at
grandpa
parlin
at
any
time
such
a
stout
swing
in
the
big
tree
such
a
beautiful
garden
with
a
in

such
a
nice
cosy
seat
in
the
trees
so
many
cubby
holes
all
about

the
western

come
from

to
visit
their
friends
in

two
years
but
grace
and
susy
became
fast
friends
in
a
very
short
time
while
little
prudy
was
thrown
one
side
for
horace
to
take
care
of
when
he
could
stop
o

time
but
she
did
it
after
a
while
grace
and
horace
and
susy
came
down
stairs
and
then
there
was
a
great
time
as
soon
as
breakfast
was
over
kind
aunt
madge
promised
to
make
out
a
list
of
the
little
folks
to
be
invited

of

she
are

said
cousin
grace
tossing
her
head
they
race
round
and
act
so
of

susy
i
laugh
if

echoed
prudy
they
are
pickin
fusses
all
the
time
cousin
horace
stood
by
aunt
madge
chair
looking
quite
forlorn
but
too
proud
to
say
a
word
see
here
horace
said
grace
very
grandly
we
think
you
better
go
i
reckon
i
wo
if

do
want
to
said
horace
working
the
flag
out
of
his
cap
he
knew
the
girls
thought
he
was
almost
always
in
the
way
i
want
to
tell
you
something
horace
said
aunt
madge
stroking
his
hair
allen
is
going
out
to
north
pond
with
some
other
gentleman
fishing
and
i
begged
him
to
let
you
go
and
he
said
he
would
though
he
would
take
the
girls
for
any
thing
there
girls
cried
horace
with
beaming
face
did
allen
truly
say
so
auntie
of
course
he
would
have
girls
go
if
we
caught
a
fish
how
they
would
scream
would
they
though
horace
darted
off
to
find
allen
and
so
he
was
out
of
the
way
now
said
aunt
madge
smiling
tell
me
what
girls
you
want
to
ask
grace
so
they
gave
several
names
grace
and
susy
which
prudy
repeated
after
them
but
where
is
abby
grant
said
aunt
madge
do
you
want
her
grace
and
susy
looked
at
each
other
without
speaking
prudy
looked
at
them
i
do
go
with
such
poor
girls
when
i
home
said
grace
nor
i
do
said
susy
nor
me
neither
chimed
in
little
prudy
glad
to
know
what
to
say
aunt
madge
shook
her
curly
head
i
guess
you
must
have
a
party
said
she
if
you
slight
good
little
girls
because
they
are
poor
why
i
should
ask
her
a
great
deal
quicker
because
it
is
often
she
has
any
thing
nice
to
eat
at
home
so
would
i
said
grace
looking
ashamed
you
may
put
her
name
down
auntie
yes
put
her
name
down
auntie
said
prudy
such
a
time
as
there
was
to
get
ready
for
that
party
aunt
madge
and
aunt
louise
worked
with
all
their
might
cooking
nice
things
and
the
children
were
too
happy
to
keep
still
susy
mother
had
gone
back
to
portland
when
the
first
little
girl
arrived
grace
and
susy
had
the
slightest
idea
what
to
do
with
her
and
aunt
madge
had
to
go
in
and
set
them
to
playing
puss
in
the
corner
the
next
girl
that
came
was
abby
grant
i
ye
would
come
said
prudy
we
never
asked
you
why
child
said
grace
blushing
yes
we
did
ask
her
too
o
so
we
did
said
foolish
little
prudy
we
asked
you
abby
you
do
get
any
thing
nice
to
eat
to
your
house
grace
did
shake
prudy
only
because
she
did
dare
to
in
a
few
minutes
all
the
little
girls
had
come
and
the
whole
party
went
into
the
front
yard
to
play
aunt
madge
made
believe
she
was
a
little
girl
and
played
ring
round
rosy
catch
and
button
as
hard
as
any
body
when
they
had
played
till
they
were
all
out
of
breath
aunt
louise
sent
them
to
the
in
the
garden
to
rest
while
she
and
aunt
madge
set
the
table
in
the
front
yard
o
the
apple
puffs
and
lemon
tarts
and
little
seed
cakes
and
frosted
cake
and
candy
looked
so
good
to
poor
little
abby
grant
then
the
raspberries
like
red
coral
and
the
white
currants
like
round
pearls
then
the
flowers
fresh
from
the
garden
the
children
sat
on
the
double
steps
of
the
long
piazza
to
eat
their
supper
they
had
plenty
of
room
and
it
was
nice
fun
to
peep
round
the
great
white
pillars
at
their
neighbors
plates
and
whisper
to
one
another
i
having
a
grand
time
ai
you
what
splendid
cake
do
you
wish
you
lived
here
and
the
two
aunties
smiled
and
said
to
each
other
it
is
worth
all
our
trouble
to
see
these
children
so
happy
after
the
table
was
cleared
away
they
sang
several
pieces
and
sweet
little
voice
filled
all
the
pauses
with
some
funny
little
chorus
of
her
own
when
the
party
broke
up
the
children
were
quite
tired
out
and
glad
to
go
to

not
know
it
said
grandma
if
he
should
catch
any
children
in
his
field
he
would
be
sure
to
give
them
a
severe
scolding
besides
chimed
in
aunt
madge
prudy
is
fit
to
walk
so
far
she
is
very
well
no
she
is
quite
out
of
sorts
said
grandma
so
if
you
must
go
somewhere
you
may
take
your
little
baskets
and
go
out
in
the
meadow
on
the
other
side
of
the
cornfield
only
take
good
care
of
prudy
now
remember
grandma
always
says
that
over
said
susy
as
the
three
children
were
on
their
way
to
the
meadow
and
aunt
madge
always
says
it
too
care
of
prudy
as
if
she
were
a
little
baby
that
is
all
because
she
cries
so
much
i
presume
said
grace
looking
at
poor
prudy
rather
sternly
i
did
hope
susy
that
when
horace
went
down
to
the
fishing
you
and
i
might
go
off
by
ourselves
and
have
a
nice
time
for
once
but
here
is
right
at
our
heels
we
never
can
have
any
peace
little
miss
somebody
thinks
she
must
follow
of
course
yes
that
the
way
it
is
said
susy
some
folks
are
always
round
you
know
now
susy
said
prudy
forcing
back
her
tears
as
well
as
she
could
i
guess
you
do
love
your
little
sister
or
you
would
talk
that
way
to
me
they
gathered
strawberries
for
a
while
in
silence
prudy
picking
more
leaves
than
berries
and
sometimes
in
her
haste
to
keep
up
with
the
others
pulling
up
grass
by
the
roots
well
i
do
think
much
of
this
said
grace
there
ai
more
than
ten
strawberries
in
this
meadow
and
those
ai
bigger
than
peas
o
i
know
it
said
susy
in
the
tone
of
one
who
has
made
up
her
mind
for
the
worst
i
suppose
we
got
to
stay
here
though
we
could
go
up
in
the
pines
now
if
it
was
for
prudy
and
they
are
real
thick
up
there
yes
said
grace
but
grandma
knew
we
could
without
she
would
be
sure
to
follow
do
you
think
judkins
would
be
likely
to
scold
susy
no
indeed
said
susy
eating
a
dry
strawberry
he
keeps
sheep
and
goes
round
talking
to
himself
i
ai
a
bit
afraid
of
him
what
could
we
little
girls
do
to
his
grass
i
like
to
know
it
is
as
if
we
were
great
rude
boys
is
it
grace
no
said
grace
thoughtfully
now
if
we
could
only
get
rid
of
prudy
little
prudy
pushed
back
her
shaker
and
looked
up
showing
a
pair
of
flushed
cheeks
damp
with
tears
i
do
think
you
are
very
polite
to
me
said
the
child
i
shall
go
to
heaven
and
i
sha
never
come
back
any
more
and
then
i
guess
you
cry
what
shall
we
do
said
grace
looking
at
susy
we
must
take
her
and
we
ca
go
without
her
well
i
right
straight
home
right
off
that
what
goin
to
do
said
prudy
and
when
i
say
my
prayers
i
shall
just
tell
god
how
naughty
you
be
prudy
turned
short
about
and
the
girls
went
toward
the
pines
feeling
far
from
happy
for
a
still
small
voice
told
them
they
were
doing
wrong
they
had
got
about
half
way
up
the
hill
when
looking
back
there
was
prudy
puffing
and
running
for
dear
life
i
thought
you
had
gone
home
said
susy
quite
vexed
well
i
did
said
prudy
who
had
got
her
smiles
all
back
again
i
could
get
home
i
got
my
feet
damp
and
some
wet
i
wo
be
no
trouble
susy
so
the
girls
made
the
best
of
it
and
helped
little
mother
bunch
up
the
long
steep
hill
prudy
had
one
hearty
cry
before
the
long
walk
was
over
her
nose
fell
on
a
rock
she
said
but
as
it
was
only
grazed
a
little
she
soon
forgot
about
it
this
is
something
worth
while
now
said
grace
after
they
had
at
last
reached
the
field
and
were
seated
in
the
tall
grass
the
strawberries
are
as
thick
as
spatter
yes
said
susy
and
grandma
and
aunt
madge
will
be
so
glad
to
see
our
baskets
full
they
certainly
be
glad
we
did
stay
in
the
meadow
big
as
your
thumb
ai
they
illustration
flying
from
the
field
you
see
the
girls
were
trying
to
stifle
that
still
small
voice
and
they
tried
to
believe
they
were
having
a
good
time
grace
and
susy
had
got
their
baskets
nearly
half
full
and
prudy
had
covered
the
bottom
of
hers
with
leaves
stems
and
a
few
berries
when
a
man
voice
was
heard
muttering
not
far
off
o
grace
whispered
susy
that
mr
judkins
he
carried
a
whetstone
on
which
he
was
sharpening
his
jackknife
ah
said
he
talking
to
himself
and
not
appearing
to
notice
the
girls
i
never
would
have
thought
that
these
little
children
ah
would
have
come
into
my
field
ah
and
trampled
down
my
grass
i
shall
hate
ah
to
cut
off
their
little
ears
ah
and
see
the
blood
running
down
i
suppose
it
was
not
two
minutes
before
the
children
had
left
that
field
pulling
the
screaming
prudy
through
the
bars
as
roughly
as
if
she
had
been
a
sack
of
wool
instead
of
flesh
and
blood
their
hair
flying
in
the
wind
and
their
poor
little
hearts
pounding
against
their
sides
like
if
the
field
had
been
on
fire
they
could
not
have
run
faster
dragging
helpless
prudy
who
screamed
all
the
way
at
the
very
top
of
her
voice
susy
and
prudy
had
thrown
away
their
pretty
little
baskets
grace
had
pushed
hers
up
her
arm
and
her
sleeve
was
soaking
in
the
red
juice
of
the
bruised
strawberries
while
little
streams
of
juice
were
trickling
down
her
nice
dress
ruining
it
entirely
you
had
ought
to
have
took
me
up
there
sobbed
prudy
as
soon
as
she
could
find
her
voice
and
these
were
the
first
words
spoken
o
hush
hush
right
up
cried
susy
in
terror
he
after
us
to
take
us
to
jail
the
family
were
really
frightened
when
the
panting
children
rushed
into
the
house
in
such
a
plight
it
was
a
crazy
drunk
man
cried
prudy
and
he
had
a
axe
no
said
grace
it
was
that
wicked
judkins
and
it
was
his
jackknife
and
he
snips
off
your
ears
and
nose
broke
in
prudy
and
blood
comes
down
and
he
kills
you
dead
and
then
he
puts
you
in
jail
and
then
he
chased
us
do
you
hear
him
comin
what
does
all
this
mean
cried
grandma
and
aunt
madge
in
one
breath
have

been
in
that
children
grace
and
susy
hung
their
heads

prudy
and
i

and
took
me
up
there
and
was
they
were
naughty
what
shall
i
do
with
children
that
disobey
me
in
this
manner
said
grandma
much
displeased
worst
of
all
said
aunt
madge
pulling
off
prudy
shoes
this
child
has
got
her
feet
wet
and
is
sure
to
be
sick
chapter
vi
prudy
sick
when
aunt
madge
went
up
stairs
that
night
she
found
little
prudy
hiding
her
head
under
the
pillow
and
screaming
with
fright
o
there
i
was
cried
the
child
tossing
up
her
arms
all
tumbled
out
of
the
window
and
the
man
got
me
and
i
begun
to
be
dead
why
no
darling
said
aunt
madge
here
is
auntie
close
by
you
and
here
you
are
in
your
pretty
white
bed
do
you
see
no
no
screamed
prudy
i
up
in
the
pines
i
ai
here
perhaps
you
like
to
have
me
sing
to
you
said
aunt
madge
and
she
began
in
a
low
voice
a
little
ditty
prudy
loved
there
was
a
little
darling
i
used
to
know
and
they
called
her
prudy
long
time
ago
stop
nancy
said
prudy
you
put
a
toad
in
my
mouth
i
must
have
a
drink
dreffully
aunt
madge
brought
some
water
but
her
fingers
were
not
steady
and
the
glass
trembled
against
the
child
hot
lips
she
watched
till
prudy
dozed
again
and
then
stole
softly
down
stairs
to
get
a
night
candle
and
to
tell
her
mother
she
was
really
afraid
prudy
was
going
to
be
sick
but
parlin
said
aunt
madge
must
be
nervous
that
children
were
very
apt
to
be
out
of
their
heads
in
the
night
and
she
was
pretty
sure
prudy
would
wake
up
bright
in
the
morning
aunt
madge
tried
to
hope
so
but
she
hardly
slept
a
wink
for
prudy
tossed
and
twisted
all
night
sometimes
she
thought
she
was
picking
berries
on
the
tufted
coverlet
sometimes
she
cried
out
that
the
crazy
man
was
coming
with
a
axe
when
grandma
saw
her
purple
cheeks
by
daylight
she
did
not
laugh
at
aunt
madge
she
brushed
the
soft
curls
away
from
the
little
one
hot
temples
and
said
softly
how
do
you
feel
prudy
darling
a
wild
light
burned
in
the
child
eyes
it
is
prudy
screamed
she
i
ai
her
go
you
goin
to
snip
off
my
nose
o
go
right
off
you
may
be
sure
that
grace
and
susy
were
far
from
happy
that
day
when
they
noticed
that
their
grandmother
grew
more
and
more
uneasy
and
when
they
saw
the
doctor
gig
at
the
gate
their
hearts
were
very
heavy
o
grace
said
susy
sobbing
prudy
thought
we
did
love
her
we
kept
saying
she
was
always
round
how
much
do
you
suppose
she
is
sick
o
dear
i
do
know
said
grace
wringing
her
hands
but
i
tell
you
one
thing
we
ought
to
have
seen
to
her
susy
o
grace
said
susy
you
do
begin
to
feel
so
bad
as
i
do
you
ca
because
you
have
got
any
little
sister
only
think
of
my
scolding
to
such
a
darling
little
thing
as
she
is
come
you
go
up
stairs
and
see
what
the
doctor
says
said
grace
you
steal
in
easy
o
i
do
dare
to
whispered
susy
i
all
of
a
tremble
but
the
moment
their
grandmother
step
was
heard
in
the
passage
they
flew
to
her
parlin
set
her
vial
down
on
the
hall
table
i
do
like
to
tell
you
said
she
shaking
her
head
sadly
the
doctor
calls
her
a
very
sick
child
and
says
he
is
afraid
of
brain
fever
do
they
die
with
that
cried
susy
seizing
hold
of
her
dress
o
stop
a
minute
is
she
going
to
die
we
hope
not
said
parlin
but
she
is
so
sick
that
we
shall
send
a
despatch
for
your
mother
i
want
you
to
try
and
keep
the
house
still
girls
and
coax

said
grace
o

you
forgive
us
for
being
so
naughty
yesterday
can
you
forgive
us
said
susy
i
tell
you
we
feel
awfully
about
it
grandma
parlin
took
off
her
spectacles
to
wipe
them
my
dear
children
said
she
gravely
i
am
ready
to
forgive
you
with
all
my
heart
but
i
hope
that
before
this
you
have
asked
pardon
of
your
dear
father
in
heaven
that
is
the
first
thing
you
know
susy
stole
off
into
the
nursery
and
threw
herself
on
the
lounge
o
god
sobbed
she
i
should
think
you
would
hate
me
i
have
acted
so
bad
o
can
you
forgive
me
and
not
take
prudy
i
never
will
do
so
again
i
did
mean
any
thing
when
i
said
she
was
always
round
o
let
her
die
and
be
put
in
the
ground
please
do
dear
god
seems
to
me
i
love
her
the
best
of
any
body
when
we
have
any
fuss
it
always
me
that
to
blame
here
susy
prayer
was
drowned
in
sobs
but
her
heart
felt
a
little
lighter
because
she
had
told
her
kind
father
just
how
she
felt
and
if
it
was
best
for
prudy
to
get
well
she
was
sure
he
would
save
her
prudy
mother
came
in
the
cars
that
night
looking
pale
and
troubled
prudy
did
not
know
her
why
do
you
bring
my
own
mamma
said
she
look
at
me
darling
said
her
mother
here
i
am
right
here
mother
wo
leave
her
little
prudy
again
i
ai
prudy
screamed
the
child
prudy
gone
to
heaven
god
came
and
helped
her
up
the
steps
one
of
the
first
things
parlin
did
was
to
cut
off
her
little
daughter
beautiful
curls
and
lay
them
tenderly
away
in
a
drawer
ah
sister
madge
said
she
you
ca
guess
how
it
makes
my
heart
ache
to
have
my
child
take
me
for
a
stranger
perhaps
she
may
know
you
said
aunt
madge
though
in
her
heart
she
had
very
little
hope
of
the
child
but
prudy
did
not
know
any
body
nor
the
next
day
nor
the
next
o
the
long
weary
time
that
they
watched
by
her
bed
the
terrible
disease
seemed
to
be
drinking
up
her
life
her
cheeks
looked
as
if
fierce
fires
were
hidden
in
them
and
when
she
raved
so
wildly
her
eyes
shone
like
flames
a
deep
hush
had
fallen
on
the
house
grace
and
susy
would
go
and
sit
by
the
hour
in
their
seat
in
the
trees
and
talk
about
dear
little
prudy
horace
had
the
heartache
too
and
asked
every
day
you
think
she
going
to
die
nobody
could
answer
him
and
he
had
to
wait
like
all
the
rest
but
god
did
not
mean
that
prudy
should
die
at
last
after
many
days
the
fever
died
out
like
a
fire
when
it
has
burned
the
wood
all
down
to
cinders
then
there
was
a
pale
little
girl
left
who
looked
as
if
a
breath
would
blow
her
away
like
white
ashes
i
think
a
little
baby
that
tips
over
if
you
touch
it
could
not
be
weaker
than
prudy
was
when
she
began
to
get
well
ah
but
it
was
so
joyful
to
see
her
own
sweet
smile
once
more
though
never
so
faint
and
every
low
word
she
spoke
now
dropped
from
her
lips
like
a
note
of
music
her
father
and
mother
and
the
whole
family
were
full
of
joy
and
grace
and
susy
went
to
their
cosy
seat
in
the
trees
to
talk
over
the
pretty
things
they
were
going
to
make
for
prudy
when
she
should
be
well
enough
to
enjoy
them
chapter
vii
prudy

grandma
coming
up

one
morning

of
breath

prudy
smiling
through
her
tears

your
little

grandma
kissing
prudy
pale
cheek

thinking
of
a
little
image
aunt
madge

formed
out
of
candy
o
that
made
to
be
looked
at
said
grandma

out
of

pleasant
to

how
softly
the
little
girls
entered
the
room
and
how
the
glad
smiles
came
and
went
on
prudy
face
when
they
tried
to
amuse
her
they
were
dressed
in
a
very
funny
rig
susy
looked
a
great
deal
wiser
than
an
owl
out
of
a
pair
of
spectacles
without
any
eyes
and
a
flaring
cap
grace
had
stuck
some
false
hair
on
her
head
and
a
bonnet
that
looked
as
if
a
wagon
wheel
had
rolled
over
it
fine
day
prudy
said
grace

have
you
been

prudy

delighted

measles
deary

said
susy
pushing
back
her
cap
and
trying
to
look
frightened
how
was
she
taken
taken
repeated
prudy
taken
she
got
it
all
over
her
poor
little
creeter
cried
grace
rolling
up
her
eyes
how
she
must
suffer
i
hope
she
out
of
her
head
does
she
have
her
senses

said
prudy
o

i
laid
up
on
the
shelf
to
keep
for

here
the
two
visitors
turned
away
their
heads
to
laugh
what
do
you
my
present
will
be
said
prudy
forgetting
their
play
look
here
susy
i
could
take
that
vase
now
and
smash
it
right
down
on
the
floor
and
break
it
and
grandma
would
scold
i
sick

you
would
do
it
said
grace
o

now
prudy
you
going
to
have
a
ride
allen
laughed
to
see
aunt
madge
bundle
prudy
so
much
and
said
the
child
would
be
so
heavy
that
he
could
not
carry
her
in
his
arms
but
i
think
he
found
her
only
too
light
after
all
prudy
almost
forgot
how
hungry
she
was
when
she
was
seated
in
her
little
carriage
and
wheeled
about
the
pleasant
yard
she
had
an
idea
that
the
trees
and
the
flowers
in
the
garden
were
having
good
times
and
the
open
windows
of
the
house
looked
as
if
they
were
laughing
but
she
did
not
say
much
and
when
aunt
madge
asked
her
what
made
her
so
quiet
she
said
she
was
and
the
most
of
her
small
thoughts
were
about
her
present
now
said
allen
i
going
to
hold
you
up
so
you
can
peep
over
into
the
there
do
you
see
that
little
mite
of
a
white
piggy
o
dear
dear
dear
cried
prudy
clapping
her
hands
what
a
cunning
little
he
looks
nice
enough
to
eat
right
up
i
never
did
see
such
a
darling
o
he
winks
his
eyes
see
him
he
dead
is
he
not
a
mite
no
my
little
dear
he
alive
enough
if
that
all
said
allen
o
my
stars
said
prudy
sighing
with
delight
do
you
wish
you
had
such
a
pretty
pink
nose
and
such
little
bits
of
shiny
eyes
allen
laughed
o
so
white
and
nice
added
prudy
he
has
got
a
speck
of
red
cheeks
his
nose
and
little
toes
may
he
have
one
of
my
oranges
i
never
did
see
any
thing
look
so
much
like
a
sugar
pig
it
did
allen
and
aunt
madge
a
world
of
good
to
see
the
child
so
pleased
do
you
know
said
she
eagerly
who
that
piggy
to
why
to
grandpa
i
suppose
o
said
prudy
very
sadly
while
the
bright
color
died
out
of
her
cheeks
at
once
i
did
know
but
it
to
grandma
well
you
little
pet
said
aunt
madge
laughing
what
do
you
care
who
it
to
you
can
look
at
it
all
the
same
ca
you
but
said
prudy
do
you
what
do
you
if
grandpa
thought
i
was
a
darlin
prudy
could
get
no
farther
of
course
he
you
a
darling
said
aunt
madge
do
you
when
i
do
tease
for
things
to
eat
and
grandma
says
i
may
think
what
i
want
for
a
present
he
be
willing
i
should
have
she
should
give
me
that
o
what
a
prudy
said
aunt
madge
laughing
till
she
cried
there
something
nicer
you
would
like
for
a
present
you
better
think
again
o
no
no
said
prudy
trembling
with
eagerness
if
grandma
should
give
me
a
house
full
of
dolls
and
candy
all
rolled
up
and
every
single
present
in
the
world
i
rather
have
that
piggy
well
well
said
allen
i
guess
the
folks
that
would
give
their
pigs
away
to
prudy
do
live
here
let
go
and
see
they
went
into
the
house
to
see
grandpa
of
course
he
said
yes
of
all
the
funny
presents
said
grandma
but
prudy
was
happy
and
that
was
enough
grandpa
was
very
kind
but
there
was
one
thing
he
would
not
consent
to
he
would
not
let
the
pig
come
into
the
house
but
as
he
said
he
would
be
sure
to
take
good
care
of
it
and
give
it
sweet
milk
to
drink
prudy
did
not
mind
so
much
when
she
grew
stronger
she
fed
it
herself
and
the
pretty
creature
knew
her
and
was
glad
to
see
her
prudy
thought
now
she
had
a
great
many
presents
that
summer
but
none
that
pleased
her
half
so
well
as
the
little
pet
pig
chapter

morning
after

aunt
madge
told
her
she

go
into
the
garden
and
get
some
currants
while
she
was
picking
with
all
her
might
and
breathing
very
fast
she
saw
horace
close
by
on
the
other
side
of
the
fence
with
a
pole
in
his
hand
i
thought
you
was
to
school
cried
prudy
well
i
ai
said
horace
pulling
his
hat
over
his
eyes
and
looking
ashamed
the
teacher
do
keep
no
order
and
i
wo

to
such
a
school

prudy
looking
very
wise
i
they

prudy
clapping
her
little
hands

the
naughty
boy
when
they
had
got
down
to
the
river

been
and
put
a
bait
on
the
end
of
your
hook
and
i
plump
it
in
the
water
so
you
just
hold
on
to
the
pole
but
it
jiggles
it
tips
me
cried
prudy
and
as
she
spoke
she
fell
face
downwards
on
the
bank
well
that
smart
said
horace
picking
her
up
there
you
sit
down
next
time
and
i
prop
up
the
pole
with
a
rock
this
way
there
now
you
hold
it
a
little
easy
and
when
you
feel
a
nibble
you
let
me
know
what
a
nibble
asked
prudy
shaking
the
line
a
nibble
why

a
bite
they
sat
quite
still
for
some
minutes
the
hot
sun
glaring
on
bare
head
with
its
rings
of
soft
golden
hair
now
now
cried
she
suddenly
i
got
a
nibble
horace
sprang
to
draw
up
her
line

right
here
on
my
neck

the
child
i
it
a
fly
now
look
here

horace
rather
vexed
you
a
little
too
bad
you
made
me
drop
my
line
just
when
i
was
going
to
have
a
nibble
wait
till
you
feel
the
string
wiggle
and
then
speak
but
do
scream
the
children
sat
still
for
a
few
minutes
longer
and
no
sound
was
heard
but
now
and
then
a
wagon
going
over
the
bridge
but
they
might
as
well
have
dropped
their
lines
in
the
sand
for
all
the
fish
they
caught
horace
began
to
wish
he
had
gone
to
school
o
dear
groaned
prudy
getting
tired
i
never
did
see
such
fishes
i
guess
they
do
want
to
be
catched
there
now
you
spoke
again
and
scared
one
away
said
horace
if
it
had
been
for
you
i
should
have
got
i
do
know
how
many
by
this
time
prudy
lip
began
to
tremble
and
two
big
round
tears
rose
to
her
eyes
poh
crying
about
that
said
horace
you
a
nice
little
girl
if
you
do
talk
too
much
so
do
you
cry
horace
rather
enjoyed
seeing
grace
and
susy
in
tears
but
could
never
bear
to
have
prudy
cry
i
tell
you
what
it
is
said
horace
when
prudy
eyes
were
clear
again
i
do
think
i
make
much
playing
hookey
i
do
like
playing
neither
returned
prudy
the
hooks
wo
catch
o
you
do
know
what
i
mean
laughed
horace
when
we
boys
west
stay
out
of
school
we
call
playing
hookey
o
do
you
but
i
want
to
go
home
now
if
we
ca
catch
any
nibbles
no
i
tell
you
what
we
do
we
walk
out
on
that
log
and
try
it
there
the
river
was
quite
high
and
this
was
one
of
the
logs
that
had
drifted
down
from
the
rips
prudy
was
really
afraid
to
walk
on
it
because
it
was
so
round
but
not
liking
to
be
laughed
at
she
crept
on
her
hands
and
knees
to
the
very
end
of
the
log
trembling
all
the
way
horace
took
the
two
poles
and
followed
but
the
moment
he
stepped
on
the
log
it
rolled
quite
over
carrying
prudy
under
i
do
not
know
what
horace
thought
then
but
he
had
to
think
fast
if
he
had
been
older
he
might
have
plunged
in
after
prudy
but
he
was
only
a
little
boy
seven
years
old
so
he
ran
for
the
house
o
how
he
ran
aunt
madge
was
ironing
in
the
back
kitchen
she
heard
heavy
breathing
and
the
quick
pattering
of
feet
and
the
words
gasped
out
prudy
in
the
river
prudy
screamed
aunt
madge
looking
wildly
at
the
boy
face
which
was
as
white
as
death
run
tell
grandpa
cried
she
and
flew
down
the
steps
and
out
across
the
field
towards
the
river
as
if
she
had
wings
on
her
slippers
though
it
seemed
to
her
they
were
clogged
with
lead
has
she
just
been
saved
from
death
only
to
be
drowned
was
one
of
the
quick
thoughts
that
rushed
across
aunt
madge
dizzy
brain
i
shall
be
too
late
too
late
and
her
mother
gone
god
forgive
me
it
is
i
who
should
have
watched
her
poor
aunt
madge
as
if
any
one
was
to
blame
but
horace
there
was
a
child
crying
down
by
the
river
not
prudy
thought
aunt
madge
it
sounds
like
her
voice
but
it
ca
be
she
has
sunk
by
this
time
do
be
afraid
prudy
cried
allen
who
was
just
behind
aunt
madge
we
are
running
to
you
the
cry
came
up
louder
it
was
prudy
voice
allen
leaped
the
fence
at
a
bound
and
ran
down
the
bank
the
child
was
out
of
the
water
struggling
to
climb
the
bank
but
slipping
back
at
every
step
she
was
dripping
wet
and
covered
with
sand
allen
lifted
her
in
his
arms
and
there
she
lay
sobbing
as
if
her
heart
would
break
but
not
speaking
a
word
when
she
was
lying
clean
and
warm
in
soft
blankets
and
had
had
a
nap
she
told
them
how
she
got
out
the
log
kept
jiggling
said
she
and
i
could
hold
on
but
i
did
i
thought
my
father
would
say
i
was
a
nice
little
girl
not
to
get
drowned
and
let
the
fishes
eat
me
up
and
so
i
kept
on
only
think
said
grandma
shuddering
and
looking
at
horace
if
prudy
had
held
on
horace
seemed
very
sad
and
humble
and
was
still
quite
pale
it
makes
you
feel
mortified
do
it
said
prudy
smiling
do
you
feel
as
if
you
could
cry
at
these
first
words
little
prudy
had
spoken
to
him
since
she
fell
into
the
water
the
boy
ran
out
of
the
room
and
hid
in
the
green
chamber
for
he
never
would
let
any
one
see
him
cry
o
wo
you
forgive
him
said
prudy
looking
up
into
clifford
face
wo
you
forgive
him
aunt
he
feels
so
bad
and
he
did
catch
a
fish
and
he
did
mean
to
and
was
the
log
that
jiggled
so
horace
was
forgiven
for
prudy
sake
chapter
ix
the
hatchet
story
one
night
the
children
clustered
about
their
aunt
madge
begging
for
a
story
fairy
you
know
said
susy
a
fairy
story
repeated
aunt
madge
i
do
know
about
that
i
told
a
little
boy
a
fairy
story
once
and
he
went
right
off
and
whispered
to
his
mother
that
i
was
a
very
wicked
lady
for
that
story
true
not
a
bit
and
if
a
baby
six
months
old
should
hear
it
he
would
believe
a
word
of
it
poh
he
was
a
smart
boy
cried
horace
so
i
am
afraid
to
tell
fairy
stories
since
that
for
i
do
like
to
be
called
a
wicked
lady
you
know
there
now
auntie

me
see
said
aunt
madge
covering
her
eyes
with
her
fingers
once
upon
a
time
when
the
moon
was
full
full
of
what
said
prudy
who
was
leaning
on
the
arm
of
her
chair
and
peeping
up
into
her
face
full
of
fairies
when
the
moon
was
round
my
child
said
auntie
stroking
the
little
hair
but

had
no
right
to
touch
it
but
it
came
into
my
head
that
i
would
try
to
break
open
the
clams
the
hatchet
instead
of
cracking
the
shells
came
down
with
full
force
on
my
foot
i
had
on
thick
boots
but
it
cut
through
my
right
boot
deep
into
the
bone
o
how
i
screamed
i
should
have
thought
you
would
auntie
cried
grace
fairly
turning
pale
did
it
bring
the
blood
yes
indeed
why
when
i
went
into
the
kitchen
my
footsteps
were
tracked
with
little
pools
of
blood
oozing
out
of
my
boot
sister
maria
screamed
out
look
at
maggie
she
cut
her
foot
with
that
hatchet
no
i
have
said
i
for
i
was
frightened
almost
to
death
and
afraid
of
being
punished
for
disobedience
you
see
father
had
forbidden
us
little
ones
ever
to
touch
the
hatchet
why
you
told
a
right
up
and
down
fib
said
susy
looking
shocked
a
real
whopper
said
horace
shaking
his
head
so
i
did
children
and
before
my
story
is
done
you
shall
see
what
misery
my
sin
caused
me
did
allen
know
about
it
asked
little
prudy
i
guess
not
replied
aunt
madge
blushing
he
lived
ever
so
far
off
then
o
dear
sighed
prudy
i
wish
he
had
gone
to
the
wars
how
it
made
you
cry
hush
up
please
ca
you
prudy
said
susy
aunt
madge
is
telling
a
story
well
they
sent
for
the
doctor
in
great
haste
and
then
tried
to
pull
off
my
boot
but
my
foot
was
so
badly
swollen
and
bleeding
so
fast
that
it
took
a
great
while
i
ca
tell
how
long
for
i
fainted
when
the
doctor
saw
the
wound
they
said
he
looked
very
sober
so
little
girl
said
he
that
was
after
i
came
to
myself
thought
you
make
me
a
good
job
while
you
were
about
it
no
work
about
you
you
are
the
child
that
had
the
tip
of
a
finger
clipped
off
in
the
hey
i
was
always
afraid
of
foster
so
i
only
buried
my
face
in
my
apron
and
cried
must
have
brought
the
hatchet
down
with
a
great
deal
of
force
said
the
doctor
parlin
how
deep
it
went
into
the
bone
fell
and
hit
my
foot
i
sobbed
out
never
the
hatchet
i
knew
well
enough
that
the
doctor
did
believe
me
so
said
he
well
never
mind
how
was
done
but
keep
your
foot
still
little
one
and
we
talk
about
the
hatchet
another
time
parlin
if
it
goes
to
bleeding
again
be
sure
to
send
for
me
it
was
ever
so
long
before
i
could
walk
a
step
every
time
any
body
spoke
of
my
hurt
i
said
i
was
just
coming
into
the
house
with
those
clams
and
my
foot
slipped
and
i
fell
and
hit
me
on
something
i
do
know
whether
it
was
a
hatchet
or
a
stick
of
wood
but
i
never
touched
the
hatchet
there
i
should
have
thought
that
of
auntie
said
grace
poh
cried
horace
they
must
have
known
you
was
of
course
they
did
well
every
time
the
doctor
came
to
see
me
he
laughed
and
asked
me
how
i
cut
my
foot
the
same
as
i
did
in
the
first
place
you
know
said
i
do
know
nothing
about
it
only
i
never
touched
the
hatchet
he
would
answer
remember
the
old
saying
a
lie
well
stuck
to
is
better
than
the
truth
wavering
i
did
know
what
that
meant
but
he
laughed
so
that
i
knew
he
was
making
sport
of
me
i
knew
nobody
believed
me
the
hatchet
had
been
found
red
with
blood
and
mother
looked
o
so
sad
but
i
had
told
that
falsehood
so
many
times
that
it
did
seem
as
if
i
had
any
courage
left
to
tell
the
truth
it
had
grown
to
be
very
easy
to
keep
saying
i
never
the
hatchet
makes
me
think
of
that
play
father
lost
his
hatchet
whispered
susy
to
grace
every
one
tried
to
amuse
me
while
i
was
sick
but
there
was
always
a
thorn
in
my
pillow
a
thorn
said
prudy
not
a
real
thorn
dear
i
mean
i
had
told
a
wrong
story
and
i
could
feel
happy
here
susy
turned
away
her
head
and
looked
out
of
the
window
though
she
saw
nothing
there
but
grandpa
coming
in
from
the
garden
with
a
whenever
father
looked
at
me
i
felt
just
as
if
he
was
thinking
does
tell
the
truth
and
when
mother
spoke
my
name
quick
i
was
afraid
she
was
going
to
say
something
about
the
hatchet
i
got
well
only
i
limped
a
little
then
it
was
almost
time
to
think
of
making
presents
for
the
christmas
tree
i
did
like
to
have
christmas
come
while
i
was
feeling
so
people
are
so
good
that
day
i
thought
that
is
the
time
when
every
body
loves
you
and
spends
money
for
you
i
wanted
to
confess
and
feel
but
then
i
had
told
that
lie
over
so
many
times
that
i
thought
i
take
it
back
i
talked
it
over
with
myself
a
great
while
though
and
at
last
said
i
i
do
it
first
i
asked
god
to
forgive
me
and
help
me
and
when
i
had
got
as
far
as
that
the
thing
was
half
done
children
i
went
into
the
parlor
where
your
grandfather
was
he
was
deaf
then
i
thought
i
should
choke
but
i
caught
hold
of
one
of
the
buttons
on
his
coat
and
spoke
as
fast
as
i
could
father
said
i
told
more
than
a
hundred
thousand
lies
i
take
that
hatchet
will
you
forgive
me
did
he
asked
susy
forgive
i
guess
he
did
my
dear
child
it
was
just
what
he
had
been
waiting
to
do
and
o
i
can
tell
you
he
talked
to
me
in
such
a
way
about
the
awful
sin
of
lying
that
i
never
never
forgot
it
and
sha
if
i
live
to
be
a
hundred
years
old
my
father
had
forgiven
me
i
was
sure
god
had
forgiven
me
too
and
after
that
i
felt
as
if
i
could
look
people
in
the
face
once
more
and
i
had
a
splendid
time
i
believe
that
about
all
the
there
is
to
it
children
well
said
grace
i
much
obliged
to
you
auntie
i
think
just
as
nice
as
a
fairy
story
do
you
susy
i
do
know
i
sure
replied
susy
looking
confused
see
here
auntie
i
lost
your
gold
ring
my
ring
said
aunt
madge
i
forgot
that
i
let
you
take
it
do
you
know
i
asked
you
for
it
when
you
stood
by
the
table
making
bread
and
it
slipped
off
my
finger
this
afternoon
into
the
water
barrel
why
susy
and
i
was
a
coward
and
did
dare
tell
you
auntie
i
thought
maybe
you
forget
i
had
it
and
some
time
when
you
asked
for
it
i
was
going
to
say
you
better
take
a
pair
of
tongs
and
see
if
it
is
in
the
water
barrel
o
susy
said
aunt
madge
she
is
any
worse
than
me
auntie
said
grace
ma
asked
me
how
the
mud
came
on
my
handkerchief
and
i
said
prudy
wiped
my
boots
with
it
and
so
she
did
auntie
but
i
told
her
to
and
was
i
such
a
coward
for
laying
it
off
on
little
prudy
i
am
ashamed
you
may
believe
i
am
i
am
glad
you
have
told
me
the
whole
truth
now
replied
aunt
madge
though
it
does
make
me
feel
sad
too
for
it
too
much
like
my
hatchet
story
o
do
remember
from
this
time
children
and
never
never
be
again
just
then
grandpa
parlin
came
to
the
door
with
a
sad
face
saying
margaret
please
come
up
stairs
and
see
if
you
can
soothe
poor
little
harry
by
singing
he
is
so
restless
that
neither
maria
nor
i
can
do
any
thing
with
him
this
baby
horace
brother
was
sick
all
the
time
now
and
once
in
a
while
margaret
sweet
voice
would
charm
him
to
sleep
when
every
thing
else
failed
chapter
x
more
stories
i
move
we
have
some
more
stories
said
horace
the
next
evening
as
they
were
sitting
in
the
twilight
it
your
turn
gracie
well
i
do
know
but
i
as
soon
tell
a
story
as
not
replied
grace
pushing
back
her
curls
i
reckon
pincher
wants
to
hear
one
he
begins
to
wag
his
tail
i
ca
make
up
any
thing
as
i
go
along
but
i
can
tell
a
sober
true
story
certain
true
black
and
blue
asked
prudy
who
always
have
something
to
say
whether
she
knew
what
she
was
talking
about
or
not
did
i
ever
tell
you
about
our
out
west
aunt
madge
you
see
it
was
so
queer
i
do
know
where
in
the
world
he
came
from
he
had
one
of
his
eyes
put
out
and
was
blind
out
of
the
other
and
only
a
stump
of
a
tail
and
did
know
how
to
get
his
living
like
other
dogs
o
dear
it
was
so
funny
he
should
take
it
into
his
head
to
come
to
school
now
was
it
auntie
he
knew
miss
just
as
well
as
could
be
and
used
to
go
with
the
rest
of
the
scholars
to
meet
her
every
morning
and
when
she
patted
him
on
the
head
and
said
old
doggie
it
did
seem
like
he
fly
out
of
his
wits
then
when
she
rang
the
bell
he
trotted
in
just
as
proud
hanging
down
his
head
as
meek
as
could
be
he
thought
she
rang
the
bell
for
him
as
much
as
any
of
the
rest
of
the
scholars
his
seat
was
right
by
the
stove
on
the
floor
it
a
seat
i
mean
and
he
just
lay
there
the
whole
living
time
and
slept
and
snored
you
see
he
was
so
old
auntie
but
then
we
all
loved
him
we
just
loved
him
so
o
dear
me
it
as
much
as
i
can
do
to
keep
from
crying
and
i
do
know
how
could
help
it
what
was
i
talking
about
o
he
used
to
walk
round
under
the
seats
just
as
sly
sometimes
and
put
his
nose
into
the
dinner
baskets
i
tell
you
he
liked
cake
that
dog
did
and
he
liked
meat
and
mince
pie
you
see
he
could
for
his
nose
was
as
good
as
ever
it
was
and
the
girls
used
to
cry
sometimes
when
he
picked
out
the
nice
things
but
then
we
just
loved
him
so
you
know
auntie
why
we
thought
he
was
just
as
good
as
any
body
he
never
bit
nor
growled
that
dog
did
not
a
mite
there
was
one
of
us
but
he
loved
miss
now
was
it
too
bad
snell
made
such
a
fuss
she
did
love
that
dog
one
speck
i
do
know
as
she
ever
saw
him
and
she
care
whether
he
was
dead
or
alive
i
just
know
she
did
i
tell
you
how
it
was
sometimes
he
got
locked
up
all
night
be
asleep
you
know
by
the
stove
or
else
under
the
seats
and
miss
would
forget
and
suppose
he
was
gone
with
the
rest
of
the
scholars
well
he
was
a
darling
old
dog
if
he
chew
up
the
books
i
just
about
know
he
got
hungry
in
the
night
or
he
never
would
have
thought
of
it
how
did
know
it
was
wrong
he
did
know
one
letter
from
another
he
spoiled
jenny
snell
i
know
and
lots
of
readers
and
things
but
what
if
he
did
auntie
now
what
of
it
i
ai
crying
any
thing
about
that
i
would
have
you
to
think
but
you
see
snell
made
a
great
fuss
and
went
to
her
husband
and
told
him
he
ought
to
be
shot
that
snell
ought
to
be
shot
now
susy
i
should
think
you
feel
like
laughing
or
making
the
dog
of
and
they
sent
for
the
city
marshal
you
know
garvin
horace
yes
the
man
that
scowls
so
with
the
scar
on
his
nose
and
a
in
his
hand
miss
cried
she
lifted
up
the
lid
of
her
desk
and
hid
her
head
but
we
all
knew
she
was
crying
you
see
we
had
such
a
time
about
it
we
thought
he
was
going
to
carry
the
dog
off
to
some
place
and
take
care
of
him
like
he
was
his
master
or
may
be
shut
him
up
or
something
that
way
but
do
you
believe
he
just
that
dog
right
in
the
yard
how
dreadful
yes
auntie
i
reckon
it
was
we
all
cried
like
we
should
kill
ourselves
and
put
our
fingers
in
our
ears
for
we
heard
the
man
when
he
fired
the
gun
i
mean
we
heard
the
gun
when
the
man
fired
it
and
it
was
of
no
use
but
we
stopped
our
ears
and
miss
hid
her
face
and
cried
and
cried
and
cried
o
dear
me
it
did
seem
like
we
did
any
of
us
want
to
go
to
school
any
more
if
we
could
see
our
old
dog
coming
to
meet
us
and
rub
his
head
against
our
dresses
and
it
was
just

of

two
steps
at
a
time
o
susy

naughty
child

a
fright
but
not
forgetting
her
promise
of
course
it
got
tipped
over
but
not
without
hands
you
careless
girl
do
you
get
your
shaker
and
march
home
as
quick
as
ever
you
can
i
must
go
with
you
i
suppose
lonnie
ought
to
have
come
forward
now
like
a
little
gentleman
and
told
the
whole
story
but
he
had
run
away
o
auntie
said
grace
she
was
to
blame
it
do
say
a
word
said
aunt
louise
briskly
if
she
was
my
little
girl
i
have
her
sent
to
bed
that
dress
and
apron
ought
to
be
soaking
this
very
minute
bridget
listened
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
in
a
very
angry
mood
muttering
it
not
much
like
the
child
mother
she
is
a
mother
can
pass
it
by
when
the
childers
does
such
capers
and
wait
till
they
get
more
sinse
poor
little
susy
had
to
go
home
in
the
noonday
sun
hanging
down
her
head
like
a
guilty
child
and
crying
all
the
way
some
of
the
tears
were
for
her
soiled
clothes
some
for
her
auntie
sharp
words
and
some
for
the
nice
dinner
she
had
left
o
aunt
madge
sobbed
she
when
they
had
got
home
i
kept
as
far
behind
aunt
louise
as
i
could
so
nobody
would
think
i
was
her
little
girl
she
was
ashamed
of
me
i
looked
so
there
there
try
not
to
cry
said
aunt
madge
as
she
took
off
susy
soiled
clothes
but
i
ca
stop
crying
i
feel
so
bad
if
there
any
body
gets
into
a
fuss
it
always
i
all
the
time
making
some
kind
of
trouble
sometimes
i
wish
there
was
any
such
girl
as
me
tears
came
into
aunt
madge
kind
gray
eyes
and
she
made
up
her
mind
that
the
poor
child
should
be
comforted
so
she
quietly
put
away
the
silk
dress
she
was
so
anxious
to
finish
and
after
dinner
took
the
fresh
tidy
happy
little
susy
across
the
fields
to
aunt
again
where
the
unlucky
day
was
finished
very
happily
after
all
the
truth
is
louise
said
aunt
madge
that
night
after
their
return
spilled
that
ink
and
susy
was
not
at
all
to
blame
you
scolded
her
without
mercy
for
being
careless
and
she
bore
it
all
because
she
would
not
break
her
promise
to
that
cowardly
boy
o
how
unjust
i
have
been
said
aunt
louise
who
did
not
mean
to
be
unkind
in
spite
of
her
hasty
way
of
speaking
you
been
unjust
said
aunt
madge
only
think
what
a
trifling
thing
it
is
for
a
little
child
to
soil
her
dress
and
what
a
great
thing
to
have
her
keep
her
word
susy
has
a
tender
heart
and
it
grieves
her
to
be
unjustly
scolded
but
she
would
bear
it
all
rather
than
tell
a
falsehood
for
my
part
i
am
proud
of
such
a
noble
truthful
little
niece
chapter

prudy
trying

morning

little
drops
of

of

heard
her
from
the
next
room
and
came
in
very
much
surprised
what
shall
i
do
with
such
a
little
girl
as
this
said
she
shaking
her
finger
at

you
till
you
come

pleasant
grandma
put
her
head
out
of
the
window
a
moment
for
she
did
want
any
body
to
see
her
smile
this
is
one
of
prudy
days
thought
she
i
really
afraid
i
shall
have
to
punish
her
before
it
over
very
soon
after
breakfast
the
doorbell
rang
and
a
little

about
the
room
like
a
crazy

truth
is
they

gravely
that

moments
the

in
high
spirits

in
her
pretty
lisping
way

excited
to

looks
of
the
piazza
whether

two
little

with
beaming
faces
trying
to
make
themselves
useful
what

do
thought
prudy
for
every
body
was
at
work
even
horace
who
was
turning
the
grindstone
for
the
men
i
dust
the
parlors
that
what
i
do
it
does
take
aunt
madge
so
long
so
with
the
big
feather
duster
prudy
made
a
great
stir
among
the
books
and
ornaments
and
at
last
knocked
over
a
little
pitcher
and
broke
its
nose
you
little
meddlesome
thing
cried
aunt
louise
as
soon
as
she
knew
it
this
is
one
of
your
i
should
think
i
did
mean
to
cried
the
child
i
was
trying
to
help
do
say
you
did
mean
to
you
had
any
business
to
touch
the
duster
i
shall
have
to
snip
your
fingers
i
do
believe

begged
the
child
snip
my
hands
need
snip
my
hands
and
get
the
naughty
out
they
ought
to
be
snipped
from
now
till
next
christmas
said
aunt
louise
laughing
in
spite
of
herself
to
see
the
little
one
set
to
work
with
thumb
and
finger
trying
to
do
her
own
punishing
there
there
go
off
and
be
a
good
girl
prudy
bright
spirits
rose
again
at
these
words
and
she
thought
she
would
keep
on
trying
to
make
herself
useful
it
was
aunt
madge
she
wanted
to
help
good
aunt
madge
who
was
so
busy
cooking
for
the
gypsy
supper
illustration
prudy
dusting
i
feed
her
bird
thought
the
child
he
sings
as
if
he
was
hungry
now
aunt
madge
had
fed
little
daffy
before
sunrise
and
he
was
as
yellow
and
happy
as
a
canary
can
be
but
silly
little
prudy
trotted
off
after
a
piece
of
sponge
cake
climbed
into
a
chair
opened
the
cage
door
and
swung
the
cake
before
his
eyes
of
course
daffy
flew
out
and
one
might
suppose
that
was
the
last
of
him
but
it
so
happened
that
the
windows
were
not
up
prudy
ran
in
great
fright
to
tell
aunt
madge
and
when
she
opened
the
door
the
cat
got
in
and
such
a
time
as
there
was
you
may
imagine
kitty
rushed
for
the
canary
aunt
louise
rushed
for
the
kitty
and
aunt
madge
for
the
bird
at
last
daffy
was
caught
and
safe
in
his
little
home
with
only
the
loss
of
a
few
tiny
feathers
i
give
that
child
one
sound
whipping
said
aunt
louise
let
madge
attend
to
her
replied
grandma
she
will
do
right
for
she
knows
how
to
keep
her
temper
louise
said
nothing
but
she
felt
the
rebuke
and
as
she
left
the
room
there
was
a
bright
color
in
her
cheeks
prudy
said
aunt
madge
gently
you
did
mean
to
open
the
cage
door
did
you
prudy
remembered
that
she
had
been
scolded
before
for
saying
i
mean
to
yes
i
did
replied
she
in
a
choked
voice
i
meant
to
do
it
i
really
astonished
cried
aunt
madge
raising
both
hands
then
it
surely
my
duty
to
punish
you
you
may
sobbed
prudy
you
may
shut
me
up
and
not
let
me
have
no
dinner
i
ai
hungry
i
been
eatin
cake
i
think
said
aunt
madge
it
would
be
a
better
punishment
to
keep
you
home
from
the
party
o
cried
prudy
eagerly
would
you
rather
snip
my
hands
you
can
snip
with
a
piece
o
whalebone
you
know
and
switch
me
all
over
with
a
switch
and
do
to
me
if
you
only
let
me
go
to
the
party
i
afraid
you
forget
unless
you
kept
at
home
prudy
o
no
no
i
promise
truly
i
wo
try
to
help
again
never
never
in
my
world
were
you
trying
to
help
when
you
let
out
the
bird
yes
i
was
he
was
singin
for
somethin
to
eat
o
i
begin
to
understand
said
aunt
madge
laughing
heartily
so
you
did
mean
to
be
a
naughty
girl
after
all
i
am
very
glad
of
that
prudy
for
i
could
tell
what
to
make
of
you
but
you
must
never
touch
the
cage
again
little
girls
that
want
to
must
ask
somebody
to
tell
them
what
to
do
there
now
kiss
me
dear
and
forgive
you
and
we
wo
say
any
more
about
your
being
naughty
if
you
only
remember
next
time
prudy
laughed
and
twinkled
off
the
tears
she
was
what
aunt
madge
called
a
and
was
never
unhappy
but
a
little
while
at
a
time
chapter
xiii
the
gypsy
supper
after
a
great
great
while
it
was
afternoon
and
the
children
went
up
to
the
pines
carrying
a
small
market
basket
half
full
of
nice
things
i
do
know
which
felt
most
at
home
in
those
woods
the
birds
or
the
children
it
was
at
all
like
having
a
party
in
a
parlor
where
there
are
chairs
and
rugs
in
the
way
and
where
you
ca
run
and
jump
without
being
afraid
of
hurting
something
no
there
was
any
danger
of
scratching
the
varnish
off
the
trees
nor
any
danger
of
soiling
the
soft
carpet
of
the
earth
and
if
there
had
been
a
party
it
was
enough
to
make
any
body
happy
only
to
breathe
the
sweet
air
and
look
away
down
at
the
white
village
and
away
off
at
the
blue
hills
gray
daughter
ruth
a
girl
of
fourteen
was
to
have
the
care
of
prudy
and
at
first
she
followed
the
child
about
like
her
shadow
you
dear
little
pet
said
she
do
walk
so
fast
there
now
my
sweet
dovey
let
me
take
your
hand
prudy
looked
down
at
her
shoes
with
something
like
a
pout
and
slowly
gave
her
hand
to
the
young
girl
now
you
a
little
pink
of
a
dear
said
ruth
let
see
added
she
feeling
anxious
to
say
something
for
she
thought
prudy
would
want
to
be
amused
do
you
love
your
aunt
madge
any
think
very
good
and
nice
yes
said
prudy
i
kissed
her
so
much
that
i
love
her
a
good
deal
well
i
declare
laughed
ruth
that
a
new
way
of
learning
to
love
any
body
i
guess
people
call
you
a
funny
little
monkey
do
they
no
they
do
replied
prudy
drawing
away
a
little
they
think
i
as
cunning
as
i
can
be
o
my
i
know
a
little
girl
that
thinks
pretty
well
of
herself
ah
here
comes
dedy
roberts
does
my
little
love
know
dedy
yes
i
went
to
see
her
once
she
lives
in
a
dreadful
house
well
you
two
little
lammies
can
sit
right
down
here
and
pick
flowers
and
if
you
find
a
strawberry
i
give
you
a
cent
as
if
we
was
babies
thought
the
little
girls
for
they
were
wise
enough
to
know
that
strawberries
were
gone
long
ago
i
do
like
her
said
prudy
to
dedy
when
ruth
had
turned
away
she
calls
me
names
all
the
whole
time
i
guess
she
do
know
my
name
is
prudy
i
would
let
her
said
dedy
what
did
she
call
you
o
monkeys
and
lammies
and
pinkies
and
things
do
you
she
an
after
watching
prudy
to
the
child
vexation
for
about
two
hours
ruth
forgot
all
about
her
and
it
so
happened
that
the
little
thing
strayed
off
with
horace
and
his
friend
gilbert
whom
he
called
grasshopper
to
a
little
clearing
in
the
wood
it
is
a
sad
fact
that
grasshopper
had
a
bunch
of
matches
in
his
pocket
and
the
boys
meant
to
build
a
fire
horace
gathered
the
dry
sticks
and
crossed
them
so
all
grasshopper
had
to
do
was
to
strike
a
match
and
the
fire
was
soon
crackling
briskly
how
it
pops
said
prudy
just
like
corn
i
reckon
this
is
wood
said
horace
and
they
call
it
so
because
it
pops
in
the
fire
prudy
did
not
doubt
it
she
never
doubted
any
thing
horace
said
she
stood
looking
on
with
dumb
surprise
as
he
took
out
of
the
inside
pocket
of
his
raglan
three
small
fishes
now
said
he
if
we
can
cook
these
for
our
supper
wo
we
go
be
they
minnies
asked
prudy
o
i
know
it
mack
fishes
she
means
you
see
said
horace
with
a
wise
look
at
grasshopper
no
prudy
these
are
chubbs
nice
chubbs
too
i
caught
myself
how
to
cook
a
fish
horace
had
no
idea
but
he
was
not
a
boy
to
give
up
at
trifles
if
i
put
into
the
fire
they
burn
up
said
he
but
if
i
hold
over
the
fire
they
cook
now
wo
they
your
hand
will
cook
too
i
guess
said
lazy
grasshopper
sitting
down
and
looking
on
horace
said
no
more
but
went
quietly
to
work
and
whittled
some
long
splinters
on
which
he
stuck
the
fish
and
set
them
to
roasting
true
they
got
badly
scorched
and
dreadfully
smoked
but
that
was
not
all
that
happened
a
spark
flying
out
caught
prudy
gingham
dress
and
set
it
in
flames
in
a
second
whether
the
boys
would
have
known
what
to
do
i
ca
say
but
just
then
sam
walker
a
colored
man
came
up
and
put
out
the
flames
before
prudy
fairly
knew
there
were
any
then
he
brought
water
from
a
spring
and
drowned
the
bonfire
and
gave
the
boys
a
piece
of
his
mind
all
the
while
poor
prudy
was
running
off
into
the
thickest
part
of
the
wood
crying
bitterly
sam
ran
after
her
and
caught
her
up
as
if
she
had
been
a
stray
lamb
and
though
she
struggled
hard
he
carried
her
to
the
picnic
ground
where
the
large
girls
were
just
spreading
the
table
for
supper
you
better
look
out
for
these
here
young
ones
said
sam
this
one
would
have
been
roasted
sure
if
i
had
along
in
the
nick
of
time
ruth
gray
dropped
the
paper
of
candy
she
was
untying
and
turned
very
pale
she
had
been
too
busy
playing
games
to
remember
that
she
had
the
care
of
any
body
o
you
little
ducky
darling
cried
she
seizing
prudy
in
her
arms
do
you
cry
and
you
shall
have
a
pocket
full
of
candy
you
get
burnt
a
mite
did
you
honey
no
i
ai
cryin
sobbed
prudy
i
ai
crying
any
thing
about
that
and
every
word
seemed
to
be
shaken
out
as
if
there
was
a
little
earthquake
at
her
heart
is
black
folks
o
he
is
just
as
is
that
all
said
grace
stroking
prudy
hair
did
she
ever
see
any
negroes
any
nice
black
negro
men
before
susy
i
thought
she
had
why
we
have
in
the
streets
at
portland
lots
and
lots
of
after
much
soothing
and
a
good
deal
of
candy
prudy
was
comforted
and
the
supper
went
off
famously
the
children
were
all
polite
and
even
the
boys
as
ruth
said
and
though
they
all
had
keen
appetites
nobody
was
greedy
by
and
by
when
it
would
not
do
to
stay
any
longer
they
all
started
for
home
happy
and
tired
ruth
held
prudy
little
hand
in
a
firm
grasp
and
wished
she
had
held
it
so
all
the
afternoon
for
as
she
said
to
herself
she
a
very
child
this
had
been
a
trying
day
for
prudy
and
when
aunt
madge
put
her
to
bed
her
sweet
blue
eyes
would
stay
shut
where
do
they
grow
auntie
said
she
them
black
folks
be
the
jispies
o
they
grow
any
where
replied
aunt
madge
laughing
just
like
any
body
they
are
not
gypsies
but
negroes
i
should
think
they
wash
their
faces
o
they
do
but
our
heavenly
father
made
them
black
did
he
cried
prudy
raising
her
head
from
the
pillow
and
did
he
know
how
they
was
goin
to
look
when
he
made
that
man
that
catched
me
up
why
how
he
must
feel
he
was
very
kind
said
aunt
madge
trembling
as
she
thought
of
the
child
danger
o
prudy
did
you
thank
him
no
i
did
replied
prudy
i
did
know
as
he
could
hear
any
thing
o
may
i
go
up
to
the
jispy
pines
and
thank
him
we
see
but
now
it
time
you
went
to
sleep
well
i
will
said
prudy
i
go
in
a
minute
but
auntie
good
ai
he
he
ai
black
through
he
quite
a
good
man
answered
aunt
madge
trying
not
to
smile
and
has
had
a
great
deal
of
trouble
i
ca
stop
to
tell
you
and
you
would
understand
but
i
dare
say
he
has
cried
ever
so
much
prudy
and
felt
worse
than
you
can
think
all
because
he
is
black
and
some
people
do
like
black
men
i
should
think
they
be
ashamed
cried
the
child
why
love
him
he
ca
wash
it
off
may
i
put
him
in
my
prayer
then
prudy
had
to
get
out
of
bed
and
kneel
down
and
say
her
prayer
over
again
it
followed
the
lord
prayer
and
was
in
her
own
words
o
god
please
bless
every
body
bless
all
the
big
children
and
the
little
children
and
the
little
mites
o
babies
and
bless
all
the
men
and
ladies
that
live
in
the
whole
o
the
houses
and
now
she
added
and
wo
you
please
to
bless
that
black
man
that
catched
me
up
and
bless
all
the
black
folks
forever
amen
chapter
xiv
the
the
beautiful
summer
was
passing
away
very
fast
only
a
few
days
more
till
autumn
a
little
longer
and
the
cousins
must
separate
so
for
the
time
that
was
left
they
clung
all
the
more
closely
together
i
have
called
it
a
beautiful
summer
so
it
was
but
there
is
one
sorrowful
thing
i
have
not
said
much
about
there
was
one
trouble
which
always
made
the
children
feel
sad
when
they
stopped
to
think
of
it
while
they
were
playing
in
the
or
taking
supper
up
in
the
trees
now
and
then
they
would
hear
the
tired
cry
of
the
darling
sick
baby
then
grace
would
clasp
her
hands
together
in
her
quick
way
and
say
o
dear
dear
i
wish
the
doctor
would
get
harry
well
poh
said
horace
the
doctors

have
east
ai

they
though

of
course

much
as

bruler
replied
grace
very
decidedly
i

you
how
they
make
doctors
spoke
up
little
prudy
they
take
a
man
and
put
him
in
a
bear
buffalo
coat
and
that
makes
a
doctor
and
a
gig
said
horace
and
some
sharp
things
and
lots
of
little
bottles
what
children
said
grace
looking
down
upon
them
with
a
lofty
smile
why
prudy
what

your
pocket
o

prudy
throwing
her
hands
behind

enough
to

grandma

the
child
but
she
be
willing
i
could
chew
and
get
the
all
out

she
would
i
do
know

sure
replied
susy

i
never

to
me
and
i
swallow
o
what
a
little
snipe

grace
laughing
your
pocket
is
stuffed
so
full
it
going
to
burst
open
and
you
be
sick
again
now
you
see
sick
repeated
prudy
looking
frightened
for
she
did
not
forget
her
severe
illness
then
i
throw
away
i
do
love
such
sour
things
anyhow
i
was
only
and
prudy
went
down
the
wooden
stairs
which
led
from
the
trees
and
walked
slowly
towards
the
house
dropping
the
green
apples
one
by
one
into
the
grass
at
the
kitchen
door
she
met
her
aunt
madge
who
was
in
tears
o
auntie
said
she
i
going

still

my
dearest
auntie
in
the
world
said
prudy
climbing
into
a
chair
and
throwing
her
arms
around
her
auntie
neck
while
the
raisins
dropped
to
the
floor
is
allen
dead

aunt
madge
hugging
little
prudy
as
if
she
was
good
for
the
heartache

baby

a
deal
darling

the
children
i
will
send
them
some
dinner
up
in
the
trees
and
do
let
horace
come
into
the
house
you
know
he
means
to
keep
still
but
his
boots
make
so
much
noise
prudy
gathered
up
the
raisins
and
went
out
quietly
her
happy
little
face
looking
very
sober
but
the
could
not
be
sad
long
at
a
time
and
she
had
hardly
climbed
the
steps
into
the
trees
and
given
away
the
clusters
of
raisins
before
the
sick
baby
was
almost
forgotten
there
said
horace
suddenly
i
must
go
right
into
the
house
and
see
harry
i
have
seen
him
o
no
no
cried
prudy
holding
him
back
and
speaking
very
fast
he
a
great
deal
and
auntie
said
your
boots
was
so
big
she
send
the
dinner
out
here
and
then
she
cried
like
every
thing
o
said
grace
i
so
afraid
the
baby
wo
get
well
aunt
madge
did
say
any
thing
about
about
harry
did
she
prudy
no
replied
prudy
stopping
a
moment
to
think
she
said
he
was
wusser
a
great
deal
wusser
darling
and
then
she
talked
about
horace
boots
and
that
all
the
darling
little
baby
he
used
to
love
me
before
he
got
so
sick
and
all
the
way
coming
east
i
held
him
ever
so
much
you
know
horace
well
he
liked
me
too
said
horace
looking
very
sober
and
played
with
him
the
most
and
let
him
spoil
lots
of
my
things
so
you
have
said
grace
i
heard
ma
say
the
other
day
you
always
been
good
to
little
brother
o
susy
you
ought
to
have
seen
how
harry
used
to
jump
when
he
hear
horace
open
the
door
he
always
expected
a
frolic
did
we
have
cried
horace
dropping
his
eyes
which
were
full
of
tears
o
susy
said
grace
do
you
suppose
any
one
that
sick
all
summer
ever
gets
well
i
do
know
sighed
susy
mother
says
if
god
is
willing
get
well
and
if
he
is
they
die
god
knows
what
is
best
yes
chimed
in
little
prudy
god
knows
a
great
deal
i
do
and
so
the
children
chatted
and
played
quietly
all
day
long
sometimes
breaking
off
in
the
midst
of
a
game
to
talk
about
the
baby
it
seemed
like
a
very
strange
day
the
sky
looked
so
calm
and
peaceful
that
you
could
almost
fancy
it
was
keeping
still
to
listen
to
something
a
great
way
off
the
quiet
trees
might
have
been
dreaming
of
heaven
susy
thought
horace
begged
her
now
to
tell
that
fairy
story
about
the
bravest
of
lion
castle
but
susy
said
it
made
her
feel
wicked
to
think
of
fairy
stories
day
though
she
could
tell
why
when
the
children
went
into
the
house
at
it
was
very
still
nobody
was
to
be
seen
but
aunt
madge
who
gave
them
some
bowls
of
bread
and
milk
and
said
the
family
had
taken
tea
a
kind
of
awe
crept
over
grace
as
she
looked
at
the
tearful
face
of
her
auntie
and
she
dared
not
ask
about
the
baby
after
they
had
finished
their
supper
aunt
madge
said
you
may
all
follow
me
into
the
nursery
i
have
something
to
tell
our
dear
little
pale
baby
who
has
been
sick
day
and
night
all
this
long
summer
will
never
feel
sick
or
cry
any
more
god
has
taken
him
to
heaven
to
be
a
little
angel
all
but
prudy
knew
that
she
spoke
of
death
grace
flung
herself
on
the
floor
and
wept
aloud
horace
rushed
up
stairs
into
the
back
chamber
without
saying
a
word
to
any
body
and
susy
buried
her
face
in
the
whispering
o
god
do
let
it
be
so
it
is
true
is
it
but
prudy
only
opened
her
blue
eyes
in
wonder
when
she
saw
the
pure
little
form
of
the
baby
lying
on
the
bed
in
a
soft
crimson
dress
she
smiled
and
said
o
he
looks
as
if
he
was
asleep
and
he
is
asleep
but
see
he
does
breathe
whispered
susy
no
said
prudy
he
do
breathe
because
he
do
want
to
he
was
sick
and
it
made
him
too
tired
to
so
much
why
every
body
should
weep
was
more
than
prudy
could
tell
but
she
thought
it
must
be
right
to
do
as
the
rest
did
and
by
bedtime
she
was
sobbing
as
if
her
heart
would
break
she
afterwards
said
to
susy
i
tried
as
hard
as
i
could
to
cry
and
when
i
got
to
crying
i
cried
as
tight
as
i
could
spring
but
when
aunt
madge
wanted
to
put
prudy
to
bed
she
was
unwilling
to
go
o
no
said
she
i
want
to
wait
and
see
the
baby
go
up
see
what
said
aunt
madge
see
god
take
the
baby
up
to
heaven
sobbed
the
child
but
he
is
in
heaven
replied
aunt
madge
o
no
he
has
gone
a
single
step
i
saw
him
on
the
bed
they
have
put
his
wings
on
yet
aunt
madge
was
puzzled
and
hardly
knew
what
to
say
for
it
is
not
easy
to
make
such
very
little
children
know
the
difference
between
the
body
which
goes
back
to
dust
and
the
spirit
which
goes
to
god
who
gave
it
she
talked
a
long
while
but
i
doubt
if
prudy
understood
one
word
for
when
the
casket
which
held
the
form
of
little
harry
was
buried
in
the
garden
she
cried
because
the
earth
was
heaped
over
it
what
makes
do
it
she
asked
he
ca
get
to
heaven
through
all
that
dirt
but
by
and
by
when
days
passed
and
there
was
no
longer
a
baby
in
the
house
prudy
began
to
think
of
him
as
one
of
the
angels
and
one
morning
she
told
a
beautiful
dream
which
she
thought
she
had
had
though
she
sometimes
called
her
dreams
o
said
she
i
dreamed
about
my
angel
he
had
stars
all
round
his
head
and
he
in
the
air
like
a
bird
there
was
ever
so
many
little
angels
with
him
and
some
of
sang
they
did
sing
they
was
singing
little
boy
that
died
and
aunt
i
guess
you
would
cry
if
you
could
see
how
happy
they
were
no
no
sobbed
poor
aunt
holding
prudy
close
in
her
arms
which
she
said
felt
empty
now
it
ca
be
right
to
cry
can
it
prudy
when
i
my
baby
is
so
happy
in
heaven
chapter
xv
going
home
it
was
now
autumn
the
trees
could
keep
green
any
longer
for
their
time
had
come
so
they
just
made
the
best
of
it
like
sad
faces
laughing
through
tears
and
glowed
and
flushed
in
a
perfect
blaze
of
glory
making
believe
they
were
having
splendid
times
all
by
themselves
and
did
care
for
what
was
coming
the
parlin
children
had
stayed
a
great
deal
longer
than
their
parents
at
first
meant
they
should
stay
and
now
they
must
really
go
back
to
portland
the
little
cousins
were
sorry
to
part
for
you
know
they
had
learned
to
love
one
another
dearly
grace
and
susy
clung
together
till
the
last
moment
o
susy
sobbed
grace
do
you
forget
these
good
times
remember
to
write
no
matter
how
it
looks
i
wish
i
had
got
to
go
off
out
west
i
never
did
have
such
times
in
any
place
as
we
had
here
at
grandma
nor
i
either
said
susy
looking
sorrowfully
at
the
barn
the
seat
in
the
trees
and
the
clover
patch
remember
you
coming
back
in
just
two
years
wo
it
be
splendid
o
dear
but
two
years
is
forever
added
susy
suddenly
breaking
down
good
by
prudy
said
horace
climbing
into
the
quite
out
of
breath
he
had
run
all
the
way
to
the
post
office
just
for
the
sake
of
seeing
her
again
good
by
prudy
you
the
cunningest
little
spud
if
you
lived
out
west
i
just
go
nobody
knew
whether
horace
cried
or
not
for
nobody
saw
him
till
dinner
time
but
then
he
looked
very
sober
indeed
he
and
grasshopper
had
been
building
a
fort
he
said
and
after
he
had
told
so
much
he
seemed
not
to
care
about
talking
he
felt
captain
of
a
little
company
and
such
a
brave
soldier
that
he
would
not
even
say
he
felt
sorry
prudy
was
gone
grace
talked
a
great
deal
about
susy
and
asked
her
mamma
if
she
might
not
invite
her
to
go
out
west
some
time
clifford
said
she
should
be
very
glad
indeed
to
have
a
visit
from
both
the
children
and
who
knew
but
it
might
happen
so
for
parlin
susy
father
often
took
journeys
out
west
on
business
this
idea
struck
grace
very
pleasantly
and
she
had
a
strong
hope
of
the
visit
in
a
minute
in
two
minutes
she
had
a
firm
belief
in
it
and
the
last
we
see
of
grace
and
horace
in
this
book
they
are
sitting
on
the
piazza
eagerly
talking
about
the
next
winter
when
they
shall
both
go
to
the
cars
to
meet
uncle
edward
and
the
children
they
be
there
my
birthday
what
you
bet
said
horace
i
shall
wear
my
tippet
when
we
go
to
the
depot
and
have
a
new
hood
said
grace
i
do
know
what
my
dress
will
be
though
i
make
a
and
a
gun
and
a
steamboat
for
prudy
and
i
give
susy
my
large
doll
and
make
a
blue
dress
for
it
with
flowing
sleeves
she
shall
put
all
her
things
into
my
cabinet
what
we
have
to
eat
pecans
and
and
raisins
and
figs
o
we
shall
have
plenty
to
eat
horace
we
always
do
we
give
canned
peaches
with
cream
susy
likes
cream
as
well
as
a
cat
i
like
to
see
prudy
eat
a
a
green
one
i
mean
cried
horace
laughing
aloud
seems
like
i
can
see
her
mouth
puckering
up
now
susy
and
prudy
all
this
while
were
riding
home
in
the
cars
under
the
care
of
the
conductor
o
sighed
susy
i
wish
we
were
going
backwards
just
the
other
way
grandma
is
going
to
let
grace
boil
some
candy
and
put
oilnuts
in
it
i
guess
they
want
to
help
pull
it
said
prudy
there
now
we
got
to
brunswick
murmured
susy
i
do
like
to
get
so
far
away
from
the
folks
at
grandma
do
it
seem
real
lonesome
no
indeed
replied
prudy
i
glad
we
goin
home
to
see
mother
and
the
rest
of
what
do
you
the
baby
say
but
their
speech
was
cut
short
by
some
large
pieces
of
sponge
cake
which
the
smiling
conductor
brought
to
them
wrapped
in
a
newspaper
susy
and
prudy
reached
home
safely
and
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
said
about
them
at
present
i
think
i
will
copy
the
letter
which
prudy
wrote
to
her
dear
friend
allen
or
which
she
got
aunt
madge
to
write
the
next
time

no
more
like
