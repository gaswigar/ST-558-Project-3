is
my

releasing

anybody

we

sing
it
swing
to

yodel
it
we
wrote
it
that
all
we
wanted
to
do
why
do
i
do
this
there
are
three
reasons
short
term
in
the
short
term
i
generating
more
sales
of
my
printed
books
sure
giving
away
ebooks
displaces
the
occasional
sale
when
a
downloader
reads
the
book
and
decides
not
to
buy
it
but
it
far
more
common
for
a
reader
to
download
the
book
read
some
or
all
of
it
and
decide
to
buy
the
print
edition
like
i
said
in
my
essay
ebooks
neither
e
nor
books
http
digital
and
print
editions
are
intensely
complimentary
so
acquiring
one
increases
your
need
for
the
other
i
given
away
more
than
half
a
million
digital
copies
of
my
first
novel
down
and
out
in
the
magic
kingdom
and
that
sucker
has
blown
through
print
editions
so
i
not
worried
that
giving
away
books
is
hurting
my
sales
long
term
some
day
though
paper
books
will
all
but
go
away
we
already
reading
more
words
off
of
more
screens
every
day
and
fewer
words
off
of
fewer
pages
every
day
you
do
need
to
be
a
science
fiction
writer
to
see
the
writing
on
the
wall
or
screen
as
the
case
may
be
now
if
you
got
a
poor
imagination
you
might
think
that
we
enter
that
era
with
special
purpose
ebook
readers
that
simulate
the
experience
of
carrying
around
real
books
only
digital
that
like
believing
that
your
mobile
phone
will
be
the
same
thing
as
the
phone
attached
to
your
wall
except
in
your
pocket
if
you
believe
this
sort
of
thing
you
have
no
business
writing
sf
and
you
probably
should
be
reading
it
either
no
the
business
and
social
practice
of
ebooks
will
be
way
way
weirder
than
that
in
fact
i
believe
that
it
probably
too
weird
for
us
to
even
imagine
today
as
the
idea
of
today
radio
marketplace
was
incomprehensible
to
the
vaudeville
artists
who
accused
the
radio
station
owners
of
mass
piracy
for
playing
music
on
the
air
those
people
just
could
imagine
a
future
in
which
audiences
and
playlists
were
statistically
sampled
by
a
special
collection
society
created
by
a
congressional
consent
decree
said
society
to
hand
out
money
collected
from
radio
stations
who
collected
from
soap
manufacturers
and
other
advertisers
to
compensate
artists
it
was
inconceivably
weird
and
yet
it
made
the
artists
who
embraced
it
rich
as
hell
the
artists
who
demanded
that
radio
just
went
broke
ended
up
driving
taxis
and
were
forgotten
by
history
i
know
which
example
i
intend
to
follow
giving
away
books
costs
me
and
actually
makes
me
money
but
most
importantly
it
delivers
the
very
best
that
i
can
get
when
you
download
my
book
please
do
weird
and
cool
stuff
with
it
imagine
new
things
that
books
are
for
and
do
them
use
it
in
unlikely
and
surprising
ways
then
me
about
email
me
doctorow
with
that
precious
about
what
electronic
text
is
for
so
that
i
can
be
the
first
writer
to
figure
out
what
the
next
writerly
business
model
is
i
an
entrepreneur
and
i
live
and
die
by
market
intel
some
other
writers
have
decided
that
their
readers
are
thieves
and
pirates
and
they
devote
countless
hours
to
systematically
alienating
their
customers
these
writers
will
go
broke
not
me
i
love
you
people
copy
the
hell
out
of
this
thing
medium
term
there
may
well
be
a
time
between
the
sunset
of
printed
text
and
the
appearance
of
robust
models
for
unfettered
distribution
of
electronic
text
an
interregnum
during
which
the
fortunes
of
novelists
follow
those
of
poets
and
playwrights
and
other
scribblers
whose
industries
have
cratered
beneath
them
when
that
happens
writerly
income
will
come
from
incidental
sources
such
as
paid
speaking
engagements
and
commissioned
articles
no
not
fair
that
novelists
who
are
good
speakers
will
have
a
better
deal
than
novelists
who
are
but
neither
was
it
fair
that
the
era
of
radio
gave
a
boost
to
the
career
of
artists
who
played
well
in
the
studios
nor
that
the
age
of
downloading
is
giving
a
boost
to
the
careers
of
artists
who
play
well
live
technology
giveth
and
technology
taketh
away
i
an
sf
writer
it
my
job
to
love
the
future
my
chances
of
landing
speaking
gigs
columns
paid
assignments
and
the
rest
of
it
are
all
contingent
on
my
public
profile
the
more
people
there
are
that
have
read
and
enjoyed
my
work
the
more
of
these
gigs
i
get
and
giving
away
books
increases
your
notoriety
a
whole
lot
more
than
clutching
them
to
your
breast
and
damning
the
pirates
so
there
you
have
it
i
giving
these
books
away
to
sell
more
books
to
find
out
more
about
the
market
and
to
increase
my
profile
so
that
i
can
land
speaking
and
columnist
gigs
not
because
i
some
information
wants
to
be
free
i
at
it
because
i
want
to
fill
my
bathtub
with
money
and
rub
my
hands
and
laugh
and
laugh
and
laugh
developing

a
large
chunk
of
ebook
piracy
downloading
unauthorized

net
is
undertaken
by
people
in
the
developing
world
where
the
gdp
can
be
less
than
a

a
day
these
people
represent
any
kind
of
commercial
market
for
my
books
no
one
in
burundi
is
going
to
pay
a
month
wages
for
a

of
this
book
a
ukrainian
film
of
this
book
is
going
to
compete
with
receipts
in
the
ukraine
for
a
hollywood
version
if
one
emerges
no
one
imports
commercial
editions
of
my
books
into
most
developing
nations
and
if
they
did
they
be
priced
out
of
the
local

i
applied
a
new

very
cool
kind

both
times
the
novel
alan
sanded
the
house
on
wales
avenue
it
took
six
months
and
the
whole
time
it
was
the
smell
of
the
sawdust
ancient
and
sweet
and
the
reek
of
chemical
stripper
and
the
damp
smell
of
rusting
steel
wool
alan
took
possession
of
the
house
on
january
and
paid
for
it
in
full
by
means
of
an
transfer
he
had
to
do
a
fair
bit
of
with
the
realtor
to
get
her
set
up
and
running
on
but
he
loved
to
do
that
sort
of
thing
loved
to
sit
at
the
elbow
of
a
novitiate
and
guide
her
through
the
clicks
and
taps
and
forms
he
loved
to
break
off
for
impromptu
lectures
on
the
underlying
principles
of
the
transaction
and
so
he
treated
the
poor
realtor
lady
to
a
dozen
addresses
on
the
nature
of
international
currency
markets
the
value
of
precious
metal
as
a
kind
of
financial
lingua
franca
to
which
any
currency
could
be
converted
the
poetry
of
vault
shelves
in
a
hundred
banks
around
the
world
piled
with
the
heaviest
of
metals
glinting
dully
in
the
fluorescent
tube
lighting
tended
by
gnomish
bankers
who
spoke
a
hundred
languages
but
communicated
with
one
another
by
means
of
this
universal
tongue
of
weights
and
measures
and
purity
the
clerks
who
tended
alan
many
stores
the
used
clothing
store
in
the
beaches
the
used
in
the
annex
the
collectible
store
in
yorkville
the
antique
shop
on
queen
street
had
both
benefited
from
and
had
their
patience
tried
by
alan
discursive
nature
alan
had
pretended
never
to
notice
the
surreptitious
rolling
of
eyes
and
twirling
fingers
aimed
templewise
among
his
employees
when
he
got
himself
warmed
up
to
a
good
oration
but
in
truth
very
little
ever
escaped
his
attention
his
customers
loved
his
little
talks
loved
the
way
he
could
wax
rhapsodic
about
the
tortured
prose
in
a
victorian
potboiler
the
nearly
erotic
curve
of
a
old
table
leg
the
voluminous
cuffs
of
an
embroidered
silk
smoking
jacket
the
clerks
who
listened
to
alan
lectures
went
on
to
open
their
own
stores
all
about
town
and
by
and
large
they
did
very
well
he
put
the
word
out
when
he
bought
the
house
on
wales
avenue
to
all
his
wooden
bookcases
his
rang
every
day
bringing
news
of
another
wooden
bookcase
found
at
this
flea
market
that
thrift
store
this
rummage
sale
or
estate
auction
he
had
a
man
he
used
tony
who
ran
a
small
service
and
when
the
phone
rang
he
send
tony
over
to
his
shop
with
his
big
panel
van
to
pick
up
the
case
and
deliver
it
to
the
cellar
of
the
house
on
wales
avenue
which
was
ramified
by
cold
storages
root
cellars
disused
coal
chutes
and
storm
cellars
by
the
time
alan
had
finished
with
his
sanding
every
nook
and
cranny
of
the
cellar
was
packed
with
wooden
bookcases
of
every
size
and
description
and
repair
alan
worked
through
the
long
toronto
winter
at
his
sanding
the
house
had
been
gutted
by
the
previous
owners
who
had
big
plans
for
the
building
but
had
been
tempted
away
by
a
job
in
boston
they
had
to
sell
fast
and
no
amount
of
realtor
magic
flowers
on
the
table
soup
simmering
on
the
stove
could
charm
away
the
essential
dagginess
of
the
gutted
house
the
exposed
timbers
with
sagging
wires
and
conduit
the
runnels
gouged
in
the
floor
by
careless
draggers
of
furniture
alan
got
it
for
a
song
and
was
delighted
by
his
fortune
he
was
drunk
on
the
wood
of
course
and
would
have
paid
much
more
had
the
realtor
noticed
this
but
alan
had
spent
his
whole
life
drunk
on
trivial
things
from
others
lives
that
no
one
else
noticed
and
developed
the
alcoholic
knack
of
disguising
his
intoxication
alan
went
to
work
as
soon
as
the
realtor
staggered
off
reeling
with
a
new
year
day
hangover
he
pulled
his
pickup
truck
onto
the
frozen
lawn
unlocked
the
kryptonite
bike
lock
he
used
to
secure
the
camper
bed
and
dragged
out
his
big
belt
sander
and
his
many
boxes
of
sandpaper
of
all
grains
and
sizes
his
heat
strippers
and
his
jugs
of
caustic
chemical
peeler
he
still
had
his
jumbled
messy
place
across
town
in
a
nondescript
on
the
danforth
would
keep
on
paying
the
rent
there
until
his
big
sanding
project
was
done
and
the
house
on
wales
avenue
was
fit
for
habitation
alan
sanding
project
first
finish
gutting
the
house
get
rid
of
the
substandard
wiring
the
ancient
plumbing
the
cracked
tile
and
crumbling
plaster
he
filled
a
dumpsters
working
with
tony
and
tony
homie
nat
who
was
happy
to
help
out
in
exchange
for
cash
on
the
barrelhead
provided
that
he
required
to
report
for
work
on
two
consecutive
days
since
he
need
one
day
to
recover
from
the
heroic
drinking
he
do
immediately
after
alan
laid
the
cash
across
his
palm
once
the
house
was
gutted
to
brick
and
timber
and
delirious
wood
the
plumbers
and
the
electricians
came
in
and
laid
down
their
straight
shining
ducts
and
pipes
and
conduit
alan
tarped
the
floors
and
brought
in
the
heavy
sandblaster
and
stripped
the
age
and
soot
and
gunge
off
of
the
brickwork
throughout
until
it
glowed
red
as
a
golem
ass
alan
father
the
mountain
had
many
golems
that
called
him
home
they
lived
round
the
other
side
of
his
father
and
left
alan
and
his
brothers
alone
because
even
a
golem
has
the
sense
not
to
piss
off
a
mountain
especially
one
it
lives
in
then
alan
tackled
the
timbers
reaching
over
his
head
with
and
sandpaper
of
ever
finer
grains
until
the
timbers
were
as
smooth
as
adirondack
chairs
his
chest
and
arms
and
shoulders
athrob
with
the
agony
of
two
weeks
work
then
it
was
the
floorwork
but
the
floors
which
he
was
saving
for
last
on
the
grounds
that
they
were
fruit
this
materialized
a
new
lecture
in
his
mind
one
about
the
proper
role
of
fruit
a
favorite
topic
of
mbas
who
patronize
his
stores
and
his
person
giving
him
unsolicited
advice
on
the
care
and
feeding
of
his
shops
based
on
the
kind
of
useless
and
that
fortune
companies
apparently
paid
big
bucks
for
when
an
mba
said
fruit
he
meant
easy
pickings
something
that
could
and
should
be
snatched
with
minimal
effort
but
fruit
ripens
last
and
should
be
therefore
picked
as
late
as
possible
further
picking
the
fruit
first
meant
that
you
have
to
carry
your
bushel
basket
higher
and
higher
as
the
day
wore
on
which
was
plainly
stupid
fruit
was
meant
to
be
picked
last
it
was
one
of
the
ways
that
he
understood
people
and
one
of
the
kinds
of
people
that
he
come
to
understand
that
was
the
game
after
all
understanding
people
so
the
floors
would
come
last
after
the
molding
after
the
stairs
after
the
railings
and
the
paneling
the
railings
in
particular
were
horrible
bastards
to
get
clean
covered
in
ten
or
thirty
coats
of
enamel
of
varying
colors
and
toxicity
alan
spent
days
working
with
a
wire
brush
and
pointed
twists
of
steel
wool
and
oozing
stinging
paint
stripper
until
the
grain
was
as
spotless
and
unmarked
as
the
day
it
came
off
the
lathe
he
did
the
floors
using
the
big
rotary
sander
first
it
had
been
years
since
he
last
swung
a
sander
around
it
had
been
when
he
opened
the
shop
in
yorkville
and
he
rented
one
while
he
was
prepping
the
place
the
technique
came
back
to
him
quickly
enough
and
he
fell
into
a
steady
rhythm
that
soon
had
all
the
floors
cool
and
dry
and
soft
with
naked
exposed
woody
heartmeat
he
swept
the
place
out
and
locked
up
and
returned
home
the
next
day
he
stopped
at
the
portuguese
on
ossington
that
he
liked
they
opened
at
five
and
the
men
behind
the
counter
were
always
happy
to
sketch
out
alternative
solutions
to
his
amateur
construction
problems
they
never
mocked
him
for
his
incompetence
and
always
threw
in
a
ten
percent
contractor
discount
for
him
that
made
him
swell
up
with
irrational
pride
that
confused
him
why
should
the
son
of
a
mountain
need
affirmation
from
runty
portugees
with
pencil
stubs
behind
their
ears
and
scarred
fingers
he
picked
up
a
pair
of
knee
pads
and
a
box
of
shop
rags
and
another
carton
of
disposable
paper
masks
he
drove
to
the
house
on
wales
avenue
parked
on
the
lawn
which
was
now
starting
to
thaw
and
show
deep
muddy
ruts
from
his
tires
he
spent
the
next
twelve
hours
crawling
around
on
his
knees
lugging
a
tool
bucket
filled
with
sandpaper
and
steel
wool
and
putty
and
and
shop
rags
he
ran
his
fingertips
over
every
inch
of
floor
and
molding
and
paneling
feeling
the
talc
softness
of
the
sifted
sawdust
feeling
for
rough
spots
and
gouges
smoothing
them
out
with
his
tools
he
tried
puttying
over
the
gouges
in
the
flooring
that
he
seen
the
day
he
took
possession
but
the
putty
seemed
like
a
lie
to
him
less
honest
than
the
boards
were
and
so
he
scooped
the
putty
out
and
sanded
the
grooves
until
they
were
as
smooth
as
the
wood
around
them
next
came
the
beeswax
sweet
and
shiny
it
almost
broke
his
heart
to
apply
it
because
the
soft
newly
exposed
wood
was
so
deliciously
tender
and
sensuous
but
he
knew
that
wood
left
to
its
own
would
eventually
chip
and
splinter
and
yellow
so
he
rubbed
wax
until
his
elbows
ached
the
wax
into
the
wood
buffed
it
with
shop
rags
so
that
the
house
shone
twenty
coats
of
urethane
took
forty
days
a
day
to
coat
and
a
day
to
dry
more
buffing
and
the
house
took
on
a
high
shine
a
slippery
slickness
he
nearly
broke
his
neck
on
the
slippery
staircase
treads
and
the
portuguese
helped
him
out
with
a
bag
of
clear
grit
made
from
ground
walnut
shells
he
used
a
foam
brush
to
put
one
more
coat
of
urethane
on
each
tread
of
the
stairs
then
sprinkled
granulated
walnut
shells
on
while
it
was
still
sticky
he
committed
a
rare
error
in
judgment
and
did
the
stairs
from
the
bottom
up
and
trapped
himself
on
the
third
floor
with
its
attic
ceilings
and
dormer
windows
and
felt
like
a
goddamned
idiot
as
he
curled
up
to
sleep
on
the
cold
hard
slippery
smooth
floor
while
he
waited
for
his
stairs
to
dry
the
urethane
must
be
getting
to
his
head
the
bookcases
came
out
of
the
cellar
one
by
one
alan
wrestled
them
onto
the
front
porch
with
tony
help
and
sanded
them
clean
then
turned
them
over
to
tony
for
urethane
and
dooring
the
doors
were
glass
hinged
at
the
top
and
surrounded
by
felt
on
their
inside
lips
so
that
they
closed
softly
each
one
had
a
small
brass
on
the
left
side
that
could
brace
it
open
tony
had
been
responsible
for
measuring
each
bookcase
after
he
retrieved
it
from
alan
shops
and
for
sending
the
measurements
off
to
a
glazier
in
mississauga
the
glazier
was
technically
retired
but
he
built
every
display
case
that
had
ever
sat
inside
any
of
alan
shops
and
was
happy
to
make
use
of
the
small
workshop
that
his
daughter
and
had
installed
in
his
garage
when
they
retired
him
to
the
burbs
the
bookcases
went
into
the
house
along
each
wall
according
to
a
system
of
numbers
marked
on
their
backs
alan
had
used
measurements
and
some
cad
software
to
come
up
with
a
permutation
of
stacking
and
shouldering
cases
that
had
them
completely
covering
every
wall
except
for
the
wall
by
the
mantelpiece
in
the
front
parlor
the
wall
over
the
countertop
in
the
kitchen
and
the
wall
beside
the
staircases
to
the
ceiling
he
and
tony
did
speak
much
tony
was
thinking
about
whatever
people
who
drive
moving
vans
think
about
and
alan
was
thinking
about
the
story
he
was
building
the
house
to
write
in
may
smelled
great
in
kensington
market
the
fossilized
dog
shit
had
melted
and
washed
away
in
the
april
rains
and
the
smells
were
all
springy
ones
loam
and
blossoms
and
spilled
tetrapak
fruit
punch
left
behind
by
the
league
that
formed
up
spontaneously
in
front
of
his
house
when
the
winds
blew
from
the
east
he
smelled
the
fish
stalls
on
spadina
salty
and
redolent
of
chinese
barbecue
spices
when
it
blew
from
the
north
he
smelled
baking
bread
in
the
kosher
bakeries
and
sometimes
a
rare
whiff
of
roasting
garlic
from
the
pizzas
in
the
steaming
ovens
at
massimo
all
the
way
up
on
college
the
western
winds
smelled
of
hospital
incinerator
acrid
and
smoky
his
father
the
mountain
had
attuned
art
to
smells
since
they
were
the
leading
indicators
of
his
moods
sulfurous
belches
from
deep
in
the
caverns
when
he
was
displeased
the
cold
of
spring
water
when
he
was
thoughtful
the
hay
smell
from
his
slopes
when
he
was
happy
understanding
smells
was
something
that
you
did
when
the
mountain
was
your
father
once
the
bookcases
were
seated
and
screwed
into
the
walls
out
came
the
books
thousands
of
them
tens
of
thousands
of
them
little
kids
books
with
loose
signatures
ancient
hardcovers
outsized
novelty
art
books
paperbacks
reference
books
as
thick
as
cinderblocks
they
were
mostly
used
when
he
gotten
them
and
that
was
what
he
loved
most
about
them
they
smelled
like
other
people
and
their
pages
contained
hints
of
their
lives
marginalia
and
pawn
tickets
bus
transfers
gone
yellow
with
age
and
smears
of
meals
when
he
read
them
he
was
in
three
places
his
living
room
the
authors
heads
and
the
world
of
their
previous
owners
they
came
off
his
shelves
at
home
from
the
storage
down
on
the
lakeshore
they
came
from
friends
and
enemies
who
borrowed
his
books
years
before
and
who
forgotten
to
return
them
but
alan
forgot
he
kept
every
book
in
a
great
and
deep
relational
database
that
had
begun
as
a
humble
flatfile
but
which
had
been
imported
into
successive
generations
of
database
software
this
in
turn
was
but
a
pocket
in
the
the
inventory
in
which
alan
had
input
the
value
the
cost
the
salient
features
the
unique
identifiers
and
the
photographic
record
of
every
single
thing
he
owned
from
the
socks
in
his
sock
drawer
to
the
pots
in
his
cupboard
maintaining
the
inventory
was
serious
business
no
less
important
now
than
it
had
been
when
he
had
begun
it
in
the
course
of
securing
insurance
for
the
bookshop
alan
was
an
insurance
man
worst
nightmare
a
customer
from
hell
messenger
over
five
bankers
boxes
of
detailed
inventory
at
the
slightest
provocation
the
books
filled
the
shelves
row
on
row
behind
the
glass
doors
the
books
began
in
the
foyer
and
wrapped
around
the
living
room

behind

dining
room
in

filled
the

and
the
master
bedroom
and
the
master
bath
climbed
the
short
walls
to
the
dormer
ceilings
on
the
third
floor
they
were
organized
by
idiosyncratic
subject
categories
and

by

within
those
categories
alan
father
was
a
mountain
and
his
mother
was
a
washing
machine
he
kept
a
roof
over
their
heads
and
she
kept
their
clothes
clean
his
brothers
were
a
dead
man
a
trio
of
nesting
dolls
a
fortune
teller
and
an
island
he
only
had
two

them
often
mistook
them
for
landscapes
there
was
one
where
his
family
stood
on
his
father
slopes
mom
out
in
the
open
for
a
rare
exception
a
long
tail
of
extension
cords
snaking
away
from
her
to
the
cave
and
the
diesel
generator
outlet
he
hung
it
over
the
mantel
using
two
hooks
and
a
level
to
make
sure
that
it
came
out
perfectly
even
tony
helped
alan
install
the
shallow
collectibles
cases
along
the
house
stairwell
holding
the
level
while
alan
worked
the
cordless
powerdriver
alan
glazier
had
built
the
cases
to
specs
and
they
stretched
from
the
treads
to
the
ceiling
alan
filled
them
with
tin
toys
felt
tourist
pennants
from
central
florida
gator
farms
a
stone
from
marie
laveau
tomb
in
the
louis
i
cemetery
in
new
orleans
tarnished
brass
zippos
small
framed
bodybuilding
ads
carved
polynesian
coconut
monkeys
melamine
transistor
radios
bakelite
snow
globes
all
the
tchotchkes
he
accumulated
over
a
lifetime
of
picking
and
hunting
and
digging
they
were
gloriously
scuffed
and
he
always
sold
off
the
sterile
goods
as
quickly
as
he
could
squirreling
away
the
items
that
were
marked
with
property
of
freddy
terazzo
in
shaky
ballpoint
the
ones
with
tooth
marks
and
frayed
boxes
taped
shut
with
brands
of
stickytape
not
offered
for
sale
in
fifty
years
the
last
thing
to
go
in
was
the
cellar
they
knocked
out
any
wall
that
was
smeared
concrete
on
every
surface
and
worked
in
a
loose
mosaic
of
beach
glass
and
beach
china
smooth
and
white
with
spidery
blue
illustrations
pale
as
a
dream
three
coats
of
urethane
made
the
surfaces
gleam
then
it
was
just
a
matter
of
stringing
out
the
cables
for
the
halogens
whose
beams
he
took
care
to
scatter
off
the
ceilings
to
keep
the
glare
to
a
minimum
he
moved
in
his
horsehair
sofa
and
armchairs
his
big
old
bed
his
pots
and
pans
and
sideboard
with
its
novelty
decanters
and
his
entertainment
totem
a
man
from
bell
canada
came
out
and
terminated
the
data
line
in
his
basement
in
a
room
that
he
outfitted
with
an
uninterruptible
power
supply
a
false
floor
dry
fire
extinguishers
and
a
sensor
he
installed
and
configured
the
router
set
up
his
modest
rack
and
home
servers
fished
three
wires
through
to
the
living
room
the
den
and
the
attic
where
he
attached
them
to
unobtrusive
wireless
access
points
and
thence
to
weatherproofed
omnidirectional
antennae
made
from
copper
tubing
and
pvc
that
he
affixed
to
the
building
exterior
on
short
masts
aimed
out
over
kensington
market
blanketing
a
whole
block
with
free
internet
access
he
had
an
idea
that
the
story
he
was
going
to
write
would
require
some
perambulatory
cogitation
and
he
wanted
to
be
able
to
take
his
laptop
anywhere
in
the
market
and
sit
down
and
write
and
hop
online
and
check
out
little
factoids
with
a
search
engine
so
he
would
get
hung
up
on
stupid
details
the
house
on
wales
avenue
was
done
he
repainted
the
exterior
a
lovely
blue
fixed
the
front
step
and
planted
a
combination
of
outsized
rocks
from
the
canadian
shield
and
wild
grasses
on
the
front
lawn
on
july
first
alan
celebrated
canada
day
by
crawling
out
of
the
attic
window
onto
the
roof
and
watching
the
fireworks
and
listening
to
the
collective
sighs
of
the
people
densely
packed
around
him
in
the
market
then
he
went
back
into
the
house
and
walked
from
room
to
room
looking
for
something
out
of
place
some
spot
still
rough
and
unsanded
and
found
none
the
books
and
the
collections
lined
the
walls
the
fans
whirred
softly
in
the
ceilings
the
filters
beneath
the
open
windows
hummed
as
they
sucked
the
pollen
and
particulate
out
of
the
rooms
alan
retail
experience
had
convinced
him
long
ago
of
the
selling
power
of
fresh
air
and
street
sounds
so
he
refused
to
keep
the
windows
closed
despite
the
fantastic
volume
of
city
dust
that
blew
in
the
house
was
perfect
the
ergonomic
marvel
of
a
chair
that
ups
had
dropped
off
the
previous
day
was
tucked
under
the
wooden
sideboard
set
up
as
a
desk
in
the
den
his
computer
sat
centered
on
the
desk
a
laptop
with
a
wireless
card
and
a
screen
big
enough
to
qualify
as
a
home
theater
in
some
circles
tomorrow
he
start
the
story
alan
rang
the
house
doorbell
at
eight
he
had
a
bag
of
coffees
from
the
greek
diner
five
coffees
one
for
each
bicycle
locked
to
the
wooden
railing
on
the
sagging
porch
plus
one
for
him
he
waited
five
minutes
then
rang
the
bell
again
holding
it
down
listening
for
the
sound
of
footsteps
over
the
muffled
jangling
of
the
buzzer
it
took
two
minutes
more
he
estimated
but
he
did
mind
it
was
a
beautiful
summer
day
soft
and
moist
and
green
and
he
could
already
smell
the
fish
market
over
the
mellow
brown
vapors
of
the
strong
coffee
a
young
woman
in
long
johns
and
a
baggy
tartan
opened
the
door
she
was
excitingly
plump
round
and
a
little
jiggly
the
kind
of
woman
alan
had
always
gone
for
of
course
she
was
all
of
and
so
was
certainly
not
an
appropriate
romantic
interest
for
him
but
she
was
fun
to
look
at
as
she
ungummed
her
eyes
and
worked
the
sleep
out
of
her
voice
yes
she
said
through
the
locked
screen
door
her
voice
brooked
no
nonsense
which
alan
also
liked
he
hire
her
in
a
second
if
he
were
still
running
a
shop
he
liked
to
hire
sharp
kids
like
her
get
to
know
them
try
to
winkle
out
their
motives
and
emotions
through
observation
good
morning
alan
said
i
alan
and
i
just
moved
in
next
door
i
brought
coffee
he
hefted
his
sack
in
her
direction
good
morning
alan
she
said
thanks
and
all
but
oh
no
need
to
thank
me
just
being
neighborly
i
brought
five
one
for
each
of
you
and
one
for
me
well
that
awfully
nice
of
you
nothing
at
all
nice
morning
huh
i
saw
a
robin
just
there
on
that
tree
in
the
park
not
an
hour
ago
fantastic
great
she
unlatched
the
screen
door
and
opened
it
reaching
for
the
sack
alan
stepped
into
the
foyer
and
handed
it
to
her
there
cream
and
sugar
in
there
he
said
lots
do
know
how
you
folks
take
it
so
i
just
figured
better
sure
than
miserable
better
to
err
on
the
side
of
caution
wow
look
at
this
your
place
has
a
completely
different
layout
from
mine
i
think
they
were
built
at
the
same
time
i
mean
they
look
a
lot
alike
i
do
really
know
much
about
architecture
but
they
really
do
seem
the
same
do
they
from
the
outside
but
look
at
this
in
my
place
i
got
a
long
corridor
before
you
get
to
the
living
room
but
your
place
is
all
open
i
wonder
if
it
was
built
that
way
or
if
someone
did
that
later
do
you
know
no
she
said
hefting
the
sack
well
i
just
have
a
seat
while
you
get
your
roommates
up
all
right
then
we
can
all
have
a
nice
cup
of
coffee
and
a
chat
and
get
to
know
each
other
she
dithered
for
a
moment
then
stepped
back
toward
the
kitchen
and
the
stairwell
alan
nodded
and
took
a
little
tour
of
the
living
room
there
was
a
very
nice
media
totem
endless
shelves
of
dvds
and
videos
including
a
good
selection
of
chinese
vcds
and
black
and
white
comedies
there
was
a
stack
of
guitar
magazines
on
the
battered
coffee
table
and
a
cozy
sofa
with
an
afghan
folded
neatly
on
one
arm
good
kids
he
could
tell
that
just
by
looking
at
their
possessions
not
very
though
she
should
have
either
kicked
him
out
or
dragged
him
around
the
house
while
she
got
her
roomies
out
of
bed
he
thought
about
slipping
some
vcds
into
his
pocket
and
returning
them
later
just
to
make
the
point
but
decided
it
would
be
getting
off
on
the
wrong
foot
she
returned
a
moment
later
wearing
a
fuzzy
yellow
robe
whose
belt
and
seams
were
gray
with
grime
and
wear
they
coming
down
she
said
terrific
alan
said
and
planted
himself
on
the
sofa
how
about
that
coffee
hey
she
shook
her
head
smiled
a
little
and
retrieved
a
coffee
for
him
cream

said

greek

of
the
best

about
the
neighborhood
if

me
another
young
woman
with
a
shaved
head
baggy
jeans
and
a
tight
that
he
could
count
her
ribs
through

into
the
living

feet
and
extended
his

then
i
imagine

mimi
and
your
play
why
she
shrugged
and
combed
her
hair
back
with
her
fingers
her
hair
was
brown
and
thick
and
curly
down
to
her
shoulders
alan
adored
curly
hair
he
had
a
clerk
at
the
comics
shop
with
curly
hair
just
like
hers
an
earnest
and
bright
young
thing
who
drew
her
own
comics
in
the
back
room
on
her
breaks
using
the
receiving
table
as
a
drawing
board
she
never
made
much
of
a
go
of
it
as
an
artist
but
she
did
end
up
publishing
a
popular
annual
anthology
of
underground
comics
that
had
captured
the
interest
of
the
the
year
before
i
just
ran
out
of
inspiration
mimi
said
tugging
at
her
hair
well
there
you
are
time
to
get
inspired
again
stop
by
any
time
and
we
talk
about
it
all
right
if
i
get
back
to
it
you
be
the
first
to
know
tremendous
he
said
i
just
know
it
be
fantastic
now
who
plays
the
guitar
krishna
link
said
i
noodle
a
bit
but
he
really
good
he
sure
is
alan
said
he
was
in
fine
form
last
night
about
three
he
chuckled
pointedly
there
was
an
awkward
silence
alan
slurped
down
his
second
coffee
whoops
he
said
i
believe
i
need
to
impose
on
you
for
the
use
of
your
facilities
what
natalie
and
link
said
simultaneously
he
wants
the
toilet
mimi
said
up
the
stairs
second
door
on
the
right
jiggle
the
handle
after
you
flush
the
bathroom
was
crowded
with
too
many
towels
and
too
many
toothbrushes
the
sink
was
powdered
with
blusher
and
marked
with
lipstick
and
mascara
residue
it
made
alan
feel
at
home
he
liked
young
people
liked
their
energy
their
resentment
and
their
enthusiasm
did
like
their
at
three
but
sort
that
out
soon
enough
he
washed
his
hands
and
carefully
rinsed
the
long
curly
hairs
from
the
bar
before
replacing
it
in
its
dish
then
returned
to
the
living
room
abel
mimi
said
sorry
if
the
guitar
kept
you
up
last
night
no
sweat
alan
said
it
must
be
hard
to
find
time
to
practice
when
you
work
nights
exactly
natalie
said
exactly
right
krishna
always
practices
when
he
comes
back
from
work
he
blows
off
some
steam
so
he
can
get
to
bed
we
just
all
learned
to
sleep
through
it
well
alan
said
to
be
honest
i
hoping
i
wo
have
to
learn
to
do
that
but
i
think
that
maybe
i
have
a
solution
we
can
both
live
with
what
that
mimi
said
jutting
her
chin
forward
it
easy
really
i
can
put
up
a
resilient
channel
and
a
baffle
along
that
wall
there
soundproofing
i
paint
it
over
white
and
you
even
notice
the
difference
should
take
me
more
than
a
week
happy
to
do
it
thick
walls
make
good
neighbors
we
do
really
have
any
money
to
pay
for
renovations
mimi
said
alan
waved
his
hand
who
said
anything
about
money
i
just
want

the
problem
i
do
it
on
my
side
of
the
wall
but
i
just
finished
renovating
mimi
shook
her
head
i
do
think
the
landlord
would
go
for
it
you
worry
too
much
he
said

me
your
landlord
number
and
sort
it
out
with
him
all
right

that
terrific
albert
really

right
mimi
natalie
natalie
nodded
enthusiastically
her
shaved
head
whipping
up
and
down
on
her
thin
neck
precariously
mimi
glared
at
natalie
and
link
i
ask
krishna
she
said
all
right
then
alan
said
let
me
measure
up
the
wall
and
i
start
shopping
for
supplies
he
produced
a
matte
black
digital
tape
measure
and
started
shining
pinpoints
of
laser
light
on
the
wall
clicking
the
egg
buttons
when
he
had
the
corners
tight
the
portuguese
clerks
at
his
favorite
store
had
dissolved
into
hysterics
when
proudly
shown
them
the
gadget
but
they
were
consistently
impressed
by
the
exacting
cad
drawings
of
his
projects
that
he
generated
with
its
output
natalie
and
link
stared
in
fascination
as
he
did
his
thing
with
more
showmanship
than
was
technically
necessary
though
mimi
made
a
point
of
rolling
her
eyes
do
go
spending
any
money
yet
cowboy
she
said
i
still
got
to
talk
to
krishna
and
still
got
to
talk
with
the
landlord
he
fished
in
the
breast
pocket
of
his
jean
jacket
and
found
a
stub
of
pencil
and
a
little
steno
pad
scribbled
his
cell
phone
number
and
tore
off
the
sheet
he
passed
the
sheet
pad
and
pencil
to
mimi
who
wrote
out
the
landlord
number
and
passed
it
back
to
him
okay

and
the
crick
rise
link
stood
and
extended
his
hand
nice
to
meet
you
albert
he
said
really
thanks
for
the
muds
too
natalie
gave
him
a
bony
hug
and
mimi
gave
him
a
limp
handshake
and
then
he
was
out
in
the
sunshine
head
full
of
designs
and
logistics
and
plans
the
sun
set
at
nine
in
a
long
summertime
blaze
alan
sat
down
on
the
on
his
front
porch
pulled
up
the
matching
twig
table
and
set
down
a
wine
glass
and
the
bottle
of
niagara
chardonnay
brought
up
from
the
cellar
he
poured
out
a
glass
and
held
it
up
to
the
light
admiring
the
new
blister
he
gotten
on
his
pinky
finger
while
hauling
and
gyprock
from
his
truck
to
his
neighbors
front
room
kids
rode
by
on
bikes
and
punks
rode
by
on
skateboards
couples
wandered
through
the
park
across
the
street
their
murmurous
conversations
clear
on
the
whispering
breeze
that
rattled
the
leaves
he
had
gotten
any
writing
done
but
that
was
all
right
he
had
plenty
of
time
and
once
the
soundwall
was
in
he
be
able
to
get
a
good
night
sleep
and
really
focus
down
on
the
story
a
chinese
girl
and
a
white
boy
walked
down
the
sidewalk
talking
intensely
they
were
all
of
six
and
the
boy
had
a
russian
accent
the
market
diversity
always
excited
alan
the
boy
looked
a
little
like
alan
brother
doug
dan
david
dearborne
had
looked
when
he
was
that
age
doug
was
the
one
he
helped
murder
all
the
brothers
had
helped
with
the
murder
even
charlie
clem
carlos
cory
the
island
who
opened
a
great
fissure
down
his
main
fault
line
and
closed
it
up
over
corpse
ensuring
that
their
parents
would
be
none
the
wiser
doug
was
a
stubborn
though
and
his
corpse
had
tunneled
up
over
the
next
six
years
built
a
raft
from
the
bamboo
and
vines
that
grew
in
proliferation
on
carlos
west
coast
he
sailed
the
raft
through
treacherous
seas
for
a
year
and
a
day
beached
it
on
their
gentle
slope
and
presented
himself
to
their
mother
by
that
time
the
corpse
had
decayed
and
frayed
and
worn
away
so
that
he
was
little
more
than
a
torso
and
stumps
his
tongue
withered
and
stiff
but
he
pled
his
case
to
their
mother
and
she
was
so
upset
that
her
load
overbalanced
and
they
had
to
restart
her
their
father
was
so
angry
that
he
quaked
and
caved
in
billy
bob
brad
benny
room
crushing
all
his
tools
and
all
his
trophies
but
a
lot
of
time
had
gone
by
and
the
brothers
were
kids
anymore
alan
was
nineteen
ready
to
move
to
toronto
and
start
scouting
for
real
estate
only
doug
still
looked
like
a
little
boy
albeit
a
stumpy
and
desiccated
one
he
hollered
and
stamped
until
his
fingerbones
rattled
on
the
floor
and
his
tongue
flew
across
the
room
and
cracked
on
the
wall
when
his
anger
was
spent
he
crawled
atop
their
mother
and
let
her
rock
him
into
a
long
long
slumber
alan
had
left
his
father
and
his
family
the
next
morning
carrying
a
rucksack
heavy
with
gold
from
under
the
mountain
and
walked
down
to
the
town
taking
the
same
trail
he
walked
every
school
day
since
he
was
five
he
waved
to
the
people
that
drove
past
him
on
the
highway
as
he
waited
at
the
bus
stop
he
was
the
first
son
to
leave
home
under
his
own
power
and
he
been
full
of
butterflies
but
he
had
a
good
books
that
he
checked
out
of
the
kapuskasing
branch
library
to
keep
him
occupied
on
the
journey
and
before
he
knew
it
the
bus
was
pulling
off
the
gardiner
expressway
by
the
skydome
and
into
the
midnight
streets
of
toronto
where
the
buildings
stretched
to
the
sky
where
the
blinking
lights
of
the
yonge
street
receded
into
the
distance
like
a
landing
strip
for
a
horny
ufo
his
liquid
cash
was
tight
so
he
spent
that
night
in
the
rex
hotel
in
the
worst
room
in
the
house
right
over
the
cymbal
tree
that
the
below
hammered
on
until
nearly
two
the
bed
was
small
and
hard
and
smelled
of
bleach
and
must
the
washbasin
gurgled
mysteriously
and
spat
out
moist
sewage
odors
and
he
read
all
his
books
so
he
sat
in
the
window
and
watched
the
drunks
and
the
hipsters
stagger
down
queen
street
and
inhaled
the
smoky
air
and
before
he
knew
it
he
nodded
off
in
the
chair
with
his
heavy
coat
around
him
like
a
blanket
the
chinese
girl
abruptly
thumped
her
fist
into
the
russian
ear
he
clutched
his
head
and
howled
tears
streaming
down
his
face
while
the
chinese
girl
ran
off
alan
shook
his
head
got
up
off
his
chair
went
inside
for
a
cold
washcloth
and
an
ice
pack
and
came
back
out
the
russian
boy
face
was
screwed
up
and
blotchy
and
streaked
with
tears
and
it
made
him
look
even
more
like
doug
who
always
been
a
crybaby
alan
could
understand
him
but
he
took
a
guess
and
knelt
at
his
side
and
wiped
the
boy
face
then
put
the
ice
pack
in
his
little
hand
and
pressed
it
to
the
side
of
his
little
head
come
on
he
said
taking
the
boy
other
hand
where
do
your
parents
live
i
take
you
home
alan
met
krishna
the
next
morning
at
ten
as
alan
was
running
a
table
saw
on
the
neighbors
front
lawn
sawing
studs
up
to
fit
the
second
wall
krishna
came
out
of
the
house
in
a
dirty
dressing
gown
his
short
hair
matted
with
gel
from
the
night
before
he
was
tall
and
fit
and
muscular
his
brown
calves
flashing
through
the
vent
of
his
housecoat
he
was
smoking
a
cigarette
and
clutching
a
can
of
coke
alan
shut
down
the
saw
and
shifted
his
goggles
up
to
his
forehead
good
morning
he
said
i

on
the
porch
if

were

or

shoes
there
lots
of
nails
and
splinters
around

about

hand
and

you
pretty

with

then

hand

at
his
stubble
i

fucking
loud
with
a
table

alan
looked
sheepish

long
considering
look

i
a

said
flicking
the
dog
end
of
his
cigarette
toward
the
sidewalk
alan
did
like
or
understand
krishna
but
that
was
okay
he
understood
the
others
just
fine
more
or
less
natalie
had
taken
to
helping
him
out
after
her
classes
mudding
and
taping
the
drywall
then
sanding
it
down
priming
and
painting
it
her
brother
link
came
home
from
work
sweaty
and
grimy
with
road
dust
but
he
always
grabbed
a
beer
for
natalie
and
alan
after
his
shower
and
they
sit
on
the
porch
and
kibbitz
mimi
was
less
hospitable
she
sulked
in
her
room
while
alan
worked
on
the
soundwall
coming
downstairs
only
to
fetch
her
breakfast
and
coldly
ignoring
him
then
despite
his
cheerful
greetings
alan
had
to
force
himself
not
to
stare
after
her
as
she
walked
into
the
kitchen
carrying
yesterday
dishes
down
from
her
room
then
out
again
with
a
sandwich
on
a
fresh
plate
her
curly
hair
bounced
as
she
stomped
back
and
forth
her
soft
round
buttocks
flexing
under
her
on
the
night
that
alan
and
natalie
put
the
first
coat
of
paint
on
the
wall
mimi
came
down
in
a
little
dress
striped
tights
and
chunky
shoes
her
face
painted
with
swaths
of
glitter
you

wonderful
baby
natalie
told
her
as
she
emerged
onto
the
porch
going
out
going
to
the
club
she
said

mimi
said
the
first
words
she
spoken
to

all

great
fistfuls
of
e
and
then
you
have
to
consume
two
pounds

though
link
and
natalie
exchanged
a
raised
eyebrow
but
alan
was
already
headed
for
his
place
fumbling
for
his
keys
he
bounded
up
the
stairs
swiped
a
washcloth
over
his
face
threw
on
a
pair
of
old
cargo
pants
and
a
faded
steel
pole
bathtub
he
bought
from
a
one
day
because
he
liked
the
words
incongruity
though
he
never
heard
the
band
added
a
faded
jean
jacket
and
a
pair
of
sneakers
grabbed
his
phone
and
bounded
back
down
the
stairs
he
was
convinced
that
mimi
would
be
long
gone
by
the
time
he
got
back
out
front
but
she
was
still
there
the
stripes
in
her
stockings
glowing
in
the
slanting
light
retro
chic
she
said
and
laughed
nastily
natalie
gave
him
a
thumbs
up
and
a
smile
that
alan
uncharitably
took
for
a
simper
and
felt
guilty
about
it
immediately
afterward
he
returned
the
thumbs
up
and
then
took
off
after
mimi
who
already
started
down
augusta
headed
for
queen
street
what
the
cover
charge
he
said
once
he
caught
up
twenty
bucks
she
said

show

lot
of
booze
so

high
cover
how
the
play

she
said
and
spat
on
the
sidewalk
all
right
then
he
said

going
to
start
writing
my
story

he
said
your
story

about
she
said
no
really
what
did
i
ever
do
to
him
now
they
were
on
queen
street
walking
east
in
the
early
evening
crowd
surrounded
by
summertime
hipsters
and
wafting
appetizing
smells
from
the
bistros
and
jamaican
roti
shops
she
stopped
abruptly
and
grabbed
his
shoulders
and
gave
him
a
hard
shake
you
full
of
shit
i
know
it
and
you
know
it
i
really
do
know
what
you
talking
about

let
do
this
she
clamped
her
hand
on
his
forearm
and
dragged
him
down
a
side
street
and
turned
down
an
alley
she
stepped
into
a
doorway
and
started
unbuttoning
her
babydoll
dress
alan
looked
away
embarrassed
glad
of
the
dark
hiding
his
blush
once
the
dress
was
unbuttoned
to
her
waist
she
reached
around
behind
her
and
unhooked
her
white
underwire
bra
which
sagged
forward
under
the
weight
of
her
heavy
breasts
she
turned
around
treating
him
to
a
glimpse
of
the
full
curve
of
her
breast
under
her
arm
and
shrugged
the
dress
down
around
her
waist
she
had
two
stubby
leathery
wings
growing
out
of
the
middle
of
her
back
just
above
the
shoulder
blades
they
sat
flush
against
her
back
and
as
alan
watched
they
unfolded
and
flexed
flapped
a
few
times
and
settled
back
into
their
position
nested
among
the
soft
roll
of
flesh
that
descended
from
her
neck
involuntarily
he
peered
forward
examining
the
wings
which
were
covered
in
fine
downy
brown
hairs
and
their
bases
roped
with
muscle
and
surrounded
by
a
mess
of
ugly
scars
you
these
on
alan
said
aghast
she
turned
around
her
eyes
bright
with
tears
her
breasts
swung
free
of
her
unhooked
bra
no
you
fucking
idiot
i
sawed
them
off
four
times
a
year
they
just
grow
back
if
i
do
cut
them
they
grow
down
to
my
ankles
mimi
was
curiously
and
incomprehensibly
affectionate
after
she
had
buttoned
up
her
dress
and
resumed
walking
toward
the
strip
of
clubs
along
richmond
street
she
put
her
hand
on
his
forearm
and
murmured
funny
commentary
about
the
outlandishly
attired
club
kids
in
their
plastic
cowboy
hats
sailor
moon
outfits
and
plastic
tuxedoes
she
plucked
a
cigarette
from
his
lips
dragged
on
it
and
put
it
back
into
his
mouth
still
damp
with
her
saliva
an
act
that
sent
a
shiver
down
alan
neck
and
made
the
hair
on
the
backs
of
his
hands
stand
up
she
seemed
to
think
that
the
wings
were
and
needed
no
further
discussion
and
alan
was
content
to
let
them
stay
in
his
eye
powerful
restless
surrounded
by
their
gridwork
of
angry
scars
once
they
got
to
the
club
shasta
disaster
a
renovated
brick
bank
with
robotic
halogen
spots
that
swept
the
sidewalk
out
front
with
a
throbbing
penis
logomark
she
let
go
of
his
arm
and
her
body
stiffened
she
said
something
in
the
doorman
ear
and
he
let
her
pass
when
alan
tried
to
follow
her
the
bouncer
stopped
him
with
a
meaty
hand
on
his
chest
can
i
help
you
sir
he
said
flatly
he
was
basically
a
block
of
fat
and
muscle
with
a
head
on
top
arms
as
thick
as
alan
thighs
barely
contained
in
a
silver
shirt
that
bound
at
his
armpits
do
i
pay
the
cover
to
you
alan
asked
reaching
for
his
wallet
no
you
do
get
to
pay
a
cover
you
not
coming
in
but
i
with
her
alan
said
gesturing
in
the
direction
mimi
had
gone
i
krishna
and
her
neighbor
she
did
mention
it
the
bouncer
said
he
was
smirking
now
look
alan
said
i
have
been
to
a
club
in
twenty
years
do
you
guys
still
take
bribes
the
bouncer
rolled
his
eyes
some
might
i
do
why
do
you
head
home
sir
that
it
huh
alan
said
nothing
i
can
say
or
do
do
be
a
smart
guy
the
bouncer
said
good
night
then
alan
said
and
turned
on
his
heel
he
walked
back
up
to
queen
street
which
was
ablaze
with
tv
lights
from
the
open
studio
out
front
of
the
building
hordes
of
teenagers
in
tiny
outrageous
outfits
milled
back
and
forth
from
the
coffee
shops
to
the
studio
window
where
some
band
he
never
heard
of
was
performing
generally
ambling
southward
to
the
clubs
alan
bought
himself
a
coffee
with
a
latinate
trade
name
he
liked
to
call
them
at
the
second
cup
and
hailed
a
taxi
he
felt
only
the
shortest
moment
of
anger
at
mimi
but
it
quickly
cooled
and
then
warmed
again
replaced
by
bemusement
decrypting
the
mystical
deeds
of
young
people
had
been
his
hobby
and
avocation
since
he
hired
his
first
mimi
had
played
him
he
knew
that
deliberately
set
him
up
to
be
humiliated
but
she
also
wanted
a
moment
alone
with
him
an
opportunity
to
confront
him
with
her
wings
wings
that
were
taking
on
an
air
of
the
erotic
now
in
his
imagination
much
to
his
chagrin
he
imagined
that
they
were
soft
and
pliable
as
lips
but
with
spongy
cartilage
beneath
that
gave
way
like
livid
nipple
flesh
the
hair
must
be
silky
soft
and
slippery
as
a
pubic
thatch
oiled
with
sweat
and
juices
dear
oh
dear
he
was
really
getting
himself
worked
into
a
lather
imagining
the
wings
drooping
to
the
ground
unfolding
powerfully
in
his
living
room
encircling
him
enveloping
him
as
his
lips
enveloped
the
tendons
on
her
neck
as
her
vagina
enveloped
him
whew
the
taxi
drove
right
past
his
place
and
that
gave
alan
a
distraction
directing
the
cabbie
through
the
maze
of
kensington
market
streets
back
around
to
his
front
door
he
tipped
the
cabbie
a
couple
of
bucks
over
his
customary
ten
percent
and
bummed
a
cigarette
off
him
realizing
that
mimi
had
asked
him
for
a
butt
but
never
returned
the
pack
he
puffed
and
shook
his
head
and
stared
up
the
street
at
the
distant
lights
of
college
street
then
turned
back
to
his
porch
hello
albert
two
voices
said
in
unison
speaking
from
the
shadows
on
his
porch
jesus
he
said
and
hit
the
remote
on
his
keyring
that
switched
on
the
porch
light
it
was
his
brother
edward
the
eldest
of
the
nesting
dolls
the
bark
of
their
trinity
coarse
and
tough
and
hollow
he
was
even
fatter
than
he
been
as
a
little
boy
fat
enough
that
his
arms
and
legs
appeared
vestigial
and
unjointed
he
struggled
panting
to
his
tiny
feet
feet
like
undersized
exclamation
points
beneath
the
tapered
oh
of
his
body
his
face
though
doughy
had
not
gone
to
undefined
softness
rather
every
feature
had
acquired
its
own
rolls
of
fat
rolls
that
warred
with
one
another
to
define
his
appearance
nose
and
cheekbones
and
brow
and
lips
all
grotesque
and
inflated
and
blubbery
eugene
alan
said
it
been
a
very
long
time
edward
cocked
his
head
it
has
indeed
big
brother
i
got
bad
news
what
edward
leaned
to
the
left
the
top
half
of
his
body
tipping
over
completely
splitting
at
his
narrow
leather
belt
so
that
his
trunk
neck
and
head
hung
upside
down
beside
his
short
cylindrical
legs
and
tiny
feet
inside
of
him
was
frederick
the
perennial
middle
child
frederick
planted
his
palms
on
the
dry
smooth
edges
of
his
older
brother
waist
and
levered
himself
up
stepping
out
of
ed
legs
with
the
unconscious
ease
of
a
lifetime
practice
it
good
to
see
you
andy
he
said
he
was
pale
and
wore
his
habitual
owlish
expression
of
surprise
at
seeing
the
world
without
looking
through
his
older
brother
eyes
it
nice
to
see
you
too
frederick
alan
said
he
always
gotten
along
with
frederick
always
liked
his
ability
to
play
peacemaker
and
to
lend
a
listening
ear
frederick
helped
edward
upright
methodically
circumnavigating
his
huge
belly
retucking
his
grimy
white
shirt
then
he
hitched
up
his
sweatshirt
over
the
hairy
pale
expanse
of
his
own
belly
and
tipped
to
one
side
alan
had
been
expecting
to
see
gregory
the
core
but
instead
there
was
nothing
inside
frederick
the
void
was
empty
frederick
righted
himself
and
hitched
up
his
belt
we
think
he
dead
edward
said
his
rubbery
features
distorted
into
a
greek
tragedy
mask
we
think
that
doug
killed
him
he
pinwheeled
his
round
arms
and
then
clapped
his
hands
to
his
face
sobbing
frederick
put
a
hand
on
his
arm
he
too
was
crying
once
upon
a
time
alan
mother
gave
birth
to
three
sons
in
three
months
birthing
sons
was
hardly
extraordinary
before
these
three
came
along
she
already
had
four
others
but
the
interval
well
that
was
unusual
as
the
eldest
alan
was
the
first
to
recognize
the
early
signs
of
her
pregnancy
the
laundry
loads
of
diapers
and
play
clothes
he
fed
into
her
belly
unbalanced
more
often
and
her
spin
cycle
became
almost
lackadaisical
so
the
garments
had
to
hang
on
the
line
for
days
before
they
stiffened
and
dried
completely
alan
liked
to
sit
with
his
back
against
his
mother
hard
enamel
side
while
she
rocked
and
gurgled
and
churned
it
comforted
him
the
details
of
her
conception
were
always
mysterious
to
alan
he
been
walking
down
into
town
to
attend
day
school
for
five
years
and
learned
all
about
the
birds
and
the
bees
and
he
thought
that
maybe
his
father
the
mountain
impregnated
his
mother
by
means
of
some
strange
pollen
carried
on
the
gusts
of
winds
from
his
deep
and
gloomy
caves
there
was
a
gnome
too
who
made
sure
that
the
long
hose
that
led
from
alan
mother
back
to
the
spring
pool
in
his
father
belly
remained
clear
and
unfouled
and
sometimes
alan
wondered
if
the
gnome
dove
for
his
father
seed
and
fed
it
up
his
mother
intake
life
was
full
of
mysteries
and
he
long
since
learned
to
keep
his
mouth
shut
about
his
home
life
when
he
was
at
school
he
attended
all
three
births
along
with
the
smaller
kids
bill
and
donald
charlie
the
island
was
still
small
enough
to
float
in
the
middle
of
their
father
waiting
on
tenterhooks
for
his
mother
painful
spin
cycle
to
spend
itself
before
reverently
opening
the
round
glass
door
and
removing
the
infant
within
edward
was
fat
even
for
a
baby
he
looked
like
an
elongated
soccer
ball
with
a
smaller
ball
on
top
he
cried
healthily
though
and
gave
hearty
suck
to
their
mother
exhaust
valve
once
alan
had
cleaned
the
soap
suds
and
fabric
softener
residue
from
his
little
body
his
father
gusted
proud
warm
blustery
winds
over
them
and
their
little
domestic
scene
alan
noticed
that
little
edward
for
all
his
girth
was
very
light
and
wondered
if
the
baby
was
full
of
helium
or
some
other
airy
substance
certainly
he
hardly
appeared
to
be
full
of
since
everything
he
ate
and
drank
passed
through
him
in
a
matter
of
seconds
hardly
digested
at
all
alan
had
to
go
into
town
twice
to
buy
new
boxes
of
clean
white
shop
rags
to
clean
up
the
slime
trail
the
baby
left
behind
him
drew
at
three
seemed
to
take
a
perverse
delight
in
the
scummy
water
spreading
it
around
the
cave
as
much
as
possible
the
grove
in
front
of
the
cave
mouth
was
booby
trapped
with
clothesline
upon
clothesline
all
hung
with
diapers
and
rags
drying
out
in
the
early
spring
sunlight
thirty
days
later
alan
came
home
from
school
to
find
the
younger
kids
surrounding
his
mother
as
she
rocked
from
side
to
side
actually
popping
free
of
the
grooves
her
small
metal
feet
had
worn
in
the
cave
floor
over
the
years
two
babies
in
thirty
days
such
a
thing
was
unheard
of
in
their
cave
edward
normally
a
baby
howled
long
screams
that
resonated
through
alan
milk
teeth
and
made
his
testicles
shrivel
up
into
hard
stones
alan
knew
his
mother
liked
to
be
left
alone
when
she
was
in
labor
but
he
could
just
stand
there
and
watch
her
shake
and
shiver
he
went
to
her
and
pressed
his
palms
to
her
top
tried
to
soothe
and
restrain
her
bill
the
second
eldest
and
still
only
four
years
old
followed
suit
edward
screams
grew
even
louder
loud
and
hoarse
and
utterly
terrified
echoing
off
their
father
walls
and
back
to
them
soon
alan
was
sobbing
too
biting
his
lip
to
keep
the
sounds
inside
and
so
were
the
other
children
dillon
wrinkled
his
brow
and
screamed
a
wail
that
could
have
cut
glass
alan
mother
rocked
harder
and
her
exhaust
hose
dislodged
itself
a
jet
of
cold
soapy
water
spurted
from
her
back
parts
painting
the
cave
wall
with
suds
edward
crawled
into
the
puddle
it
formed
and
scooped
small
handsful
of
the
liquid
into
his
mouth
between
howls
and
then
it
stopped
his
mother
stopped
rocking
stopped
shaking
the
stream
trailed
off
into
a
trickle
alan
stopped
crying
and
soon
the
smaller
kids
followed
suit
even
edward
the
echoes
continued
for
a
moment
and
then
they
too
stopped
the
silence
was
as
startling
and
nearly
as
unbearable
as
the
cacophony
had
been
with
a
trembling
hand
alan
opened
his
mother
door
and
extracted
little
frederick
the
baby
was
small
and
cyanotic
blue
alan
tipped
the
baby
over
and
shook
him
gently
and
the
baby
vomited
up
a
fantastic
quantity
of
wash
water
a
prodigious
stream
that
soaked
the
front
of
alan
school
trousers
and
his
worn
brown
loafers
finally
it
ended
and
the
baby
let
out
a
healthy
yowl
alan
shifted
the
infant
to
one
arm
and
gingerly
reconnected
the
exhaust
hose
and
set
the
baby
down
alongside
of
its
end
the
baby
would
suck
though
across
the
cave
from
his
soggy
seat
in
the
puddle
of
waste
water
edward
watched
the
new
baby
with
curious
eyes
he
crawled
across
the
floor
and
nuzzled
his
brother
with
his
high
forehead
frederick
squirmed
and
fussed
and
edward
shoved
him
to
one
side
and
sucked
his
little
diaper
dripped
as
the
liquid
passed
directly
through
him
alan
patiently
picked
dripping
edward
up
and
put
him
over
one
shoulder
and
gave
frederick
the
tube
to
suck
frederick
gummed
at
the
hose
end
then
fussed
some
more
whimpering
edward
squirmed
in
his
arms
nearly
plummeting
to
the
hard
stone
floor
billy
alan
said
to
the
solemn
little
boy
who
nodded
can
you
take
care
of
edward
for
a
little
while
i
need
to
clean
up
billy
nodded
again
and
held
out
his
pudgy
arms
alan
grabbed
some
clean
shop
rags
and
briskly
wiped
frederick
down
then
laid
another
across
billy
shoulder
and
set
edward
down
the
baby
promptly
set
to
snoring
danny
started
screaming
again
with
no
provocation
and
alan
took
two
swift
steps
to
bridge
the
distance
between
them
and
smacked
the
child
hard
enough
to
stun
him
silent
alan
grabbed
a
mop
and
bucket
and
sloshed
the
puddles
into
the
drainage
groove
where
his
mother
waste
water
usually
ran
out
the
cave
mouth
and
into
a
stand
of
choking
that
fed
greedily
and
thrived
riotous
in
the
phosphates
from
the
detergent
frederick
did
not
eat
for
thirty
days
and
during
that
time
he
grew
so
thin
that
he
appeared
to
shrivel
like
a
raisin
going
hard
and
folded
in
upon
himself
alan
spent
hours
patiently
spooning
sudsy
water
into
his
little
pink
mouth
but
the
baby
would
swallow
just
spat
it
out
and
whimpered
and
fussed
edward
liked
to
twine
around
alan
feet
like
a
cat
as
he
joggled
and
spooned
and
fretted
over
frederick
it
was
all
alan
could
do
not
to
go
completely
mad
but
he
held
it
together
though
his
grades
slipped
his
mother
vibrated
nervously
and
his
father
winds
grew
so
unruly
that
two
of
the
golems
came
around
to
the
cave
to
make
their
slow
peevish
complaints
alan
shoved
a
baby
into
each
of
their
arms
and
seriously
lost
his
shit
upon
them
screaming
himself
hoarse
at
them
while
hanging
more
diapers
more
rags
more
clothes
on
the
line
tossing
his
unfinished
homework
in
their
faces
but
on
the
thirtieth
day
his
mother
went
into
labor
again
a
labor
so
frenzied
that
it
dislodged
a
stalactite
and
sent
it
crashing
and
chundering
to
the
cave
floor
in
a
fractious
shivering
of
flinders
alan
took
a
chip
in
the
neck
and
it
opened
up
a
small
cut
that
nevertheless
bled
copiously
and
ruined
his
favorite
with
snoopy
sitting
atop
his
doghouse
in
an
aviator
helmet
firing
an
imaginary
machine
gun
at
the
cursed
red
baron
that
was
nearly
the
final
straw
for
alan
but
he
held
fast
and
waited
for
the
labor
to
pass
and
finally
unlatched
the
door
and
extracted
little
george
a
peanut
of
a
child
a
infant
curled
and
fetal
and
eerily
quiet
he
set
the
little
down
by
the
exhaust
hose
where
he
put
shriveled
frederick
in
a
hopeless
hope
that
the
baby
would
suck
would
ingest
finally
and
ingest
frederick
did
his
dry
and
desiccated
jaw
swung
open
like
a
snake
unhinged
and
spread
wide
and
he
little
george
ate
him
up
in
three
convulsive
swallows
the
new
baby
making
belly
swell
like
a
balloon
alan
swallowed
panic
seized
frederick
by
the
heels
and
shook
him
upside
down
spit
him
out
alan
cried
spat
him
free
but
frederick
kept
his
lips
stubbornly
together
and
alan
tired
of
the
terrible
business
and
set
the
boy
with
the
newest
brother
within
down
on
a
pile
of
hay
he
brought
in
to
soak
up
some
of
edward
continuous
excretions
alan
put
his
hands
over
his
face
and
sobbed
because
failed
his
responsibilities
as
eldest
of
their
family
and
there
was
no
one
he
could
tell
his
woes
to
the
sound
of
baby
giggles
stopped
his
crying
edward
had
to
frederick
side
and
he
was
eating
jaw
unhinged
and
gorge
working
he
was
up
to
frederick
little
bottom
dehydrated
to
a
leathery
and
then
he
was
past
swallowing
the
arms
and
the
chin
and
the
the
giggling
smiling
head
the
laughing
head
that
had
done
nothing
but
whine
and
fuss
since
alan
had
cleared
it
of
its
volume
of
detergenty
water
fresh
from
their
mother
belly
and
then
frederick
was
gone
horrified
alan
rushed
over
and
picked
up
edward
now
as
heavy
as
a
cannonball
and
pried
his
mouth
open
staring
down
his
gullet
staring
down
into
mouth
which
gaped
open
revealing
a
mouth
george
the
smallest
mouth
twisted
and
opened
then
shut
edward
squirmed
furiously
and
alan
nearly
fumbled
him
he
set
the
baby
down
in
the
straw
and
watched
him
crawl
across
to
their
mother
where
he
sucked
hungrily
automatically
alan
gathered
up
an
armload
of
rags
and
made
ready
to
wipe
up
the
stream
that
edward
would
soon
be
ejecting
but
no
stream
came
the
baby
fed
and
fed
and
let
out
a
deep
burp
in
harmony
spat
up
a
little
and
drank
some
more
somehow
frederick
and
george
were
in
there
feeding
too
alan
waited
patiently
for
edward
to
finish
feeding
then
put
him
over
his
shoulder
and
joggled
him
until
he
burped
up
then
bedded
him
down
in
his
little
crib
the
crib
that
the
golems
had
carved
for
alan
when
he
was
born
cleaned
the
cave
and
cried
again
leaned
up
against
their
mother
frederick
huddled
in
on
himself
half
behind
edward
on
the
porch
habitually
phobic
of
open
spaces
alan
took
his
hand
and
then
embraced
him
he
smelled
of
edward
clammy
guts
and
of
sweat
are
you
two
hungry
alan
asked
edward
grimaced
of
course
we
hungry
but
without
george
nothing
we
can
do
about
it
is
there
alan
shook
his
head
how
long
has
he
been
gone
three
weeks
edward
whispered
i
so
hungry
alan
how
did
it
happen
frederick
wobbled
on
his
feet
then
leaned
heavily
on
edward
i
need
to
sit
down
he
said
alan
fumbled
for
his
keys
and
let
them
into
the
house
where
they
settled
into
the
corners
of
his
old
overstuffed
horsehide
sofa
he
dialed
up
the
wall
sconces
to
a
dim
homey
lighting
solicitous
of
frederick
sensitive
eyes
he
took
an
apollo
jim
beam
decanter
full
of
stunning
irish
whiskey
off
the
sideboard
and
poured
himself
a
finger
of
it
not
offering
any
to
his
brothers
now
how
did
it
happen
he
wanted
to
speak
to
dad
frederick
said
he
climbed
out
of
me
and
wandered
down
through
the
tunnels
into
the
spring
pool
the
goblin
told
us
that
he
took
off
his
clothes
and
waded
in
and
started
whispering
like
most
of
the
boys
george
had
believed
that
their
father
was
most
aware
in
his
very
middle
where
he
could
direct
the
echoes
of
the
water
rippling
shape
them
into
words
and
phrases
in
the
hollow
of
the
great
cavern
so
the
goblin
saw
it
happen
no
frederick
said
and
edward
began
to
cry
again
no
george
asked
him
for
some
privacy
and
so
he
went
a
little
way
up
the
tunnel
he
waited
and
waited
but
george
did
come
back
he
called
out
but
george
did
answer
when
he
went
to
look
for
him
he
was
gone
his
clothes
were
gone
all
that
he
could
find
was
this
he
scrabbled
to
fit
his
chubby
hand
into
his
jacket
pocket
then
fished
out
a
little
black
pebble
alan
took
it
and
saw
that
it
was
a
pebble
it
was
a
and
fingertip
pierced
with
unbent
paperclip
wire
it
dave
is
it
edward
said
i
think
so
alan
said
dave
used
to
spend
hours
wiring
his
parts
back
onto
his
body
gluing
his
teeth
back
into
his
head
jesus
we
going
to
die
are
we
frederick
said
we
going
to
starve
to
death
edward
held
his
pudgy
hands
one
on
top
of
the
other
in
his
lap
and
began
to
rock
back
and
forth
we
be
okay
he
lied
did
anyone
see
dave
alan
asked
no
frederick
said
we
asked
the
golems
we
asked
dad
we
asked
the
goblin
but
no
one
saw
him
no
one
seen
him
for
years
alan
thought
for
a
moment
about
how
to
ask
his
next
question
did
you
look
in
the
pool
on
the
bottom
not
there
edward
said
we
looked
there
we
looked
all
around
dad
we
looked
in
town
alan
they
both
gone
alan
felt
a
sear
of
acid
jet
up
esophagus
i
do
know
what
to
do
he
said
i
do
know
where
to
look
frederick
ca
you
i
do
know
yourself
with
something
so
you
can
eat
we
tried
edward
said
we
tried
rags
and
sawdust
and
clay
and
bread
and
they
did
work
i
thought
that
maybe
we
could
get
a
and
put
him
inside
maybe
but
god
albert
i
do
want
to
do
that
the
kind
of
thing
dan
would
do
alan
stared
at
the
softly
glowing
wood
floors
reflecting
highlights
from
the
soft
lighting
he
rubbed
his
stocking
toes
over
the
waxy
finish
and
felt
its
shine
do
do
that
okay
he
said
i
think
of
something
let
me
sleep
on
it
do
you
want
to
sleep
here
i
can
make
up
the
sofa
thanks
big
brother
edward
said
thanks
alan
walked
past
his
study
past
the
tableau
of
laptop
and
desk
and
chair
felt
the
pull
of
the
story
and
kept
going
pulling
his
housecoat
tighter
around
himself
the
summer
morning
was
already
hotting
up
and
the
air
in
the
house
had
a
sticky
dewy
feel
he
found
edward
sitting
on
the
sofa
with
the
sheets
and
pillowcases
folded
neatly
next
to
him
i
set
out
a
couple
of
towels
for
you
in
the
bathroom
and
found
an
extra
toothbrush
alan
said
if
you
want
them
thanks
edward
said
echoing
in
his
empty
chest
the
thick
rolls
of
his
face
were
contorted
into
a
caricature
of
sorrow
where
frederick
alan
asked
gone
edward
said
and
broke
into
spasms
of
sobbing
he
gone
gone
he
gone
i
woke
up
and
he
was
gone
alan
shifted
the
folded
linens
to
the
floor
and
sat
next
to
edward
what
happened
you
what
happened
alan
edward
said
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
dave
took
him
in
the
night
he
followed
us
here
and
he
came
in
the
night
and
stole
him
away
you
do
know
that
alan
said
softly
stroking
edward
greasy
fringe
of
hair
he
could
have
wandered
out
for
a
walk
or
something
of
course
i
know
it
edward
yelled
his
voice
booming
in
the
hollow
of
his
great
chest
look
he
handed
alan
a
small
desiccated
lump
like
a
black
bean
pierced
with
a
paperclip
wire
you
showed
me
this
yesterday
alan
said
it
from
a
edward
said
and
he
buried
his
face
in
alan
shoulder
sobbing
uncontrollably
have
you
looked
for
him
alan
asked
i
been
waiting
for
you
to
get
up
i
do
want
to
go
out
alone
we
look
together
alan
said
he
got
a
pair
of
shorts
and
a
shoved
his
feet
into
birkenstocks
and
led
edward
out
the
door
the
previous
night
humidity
had
thickened
to
a
gray
cloudy
soup
swift
thunderheads
coming
in
from
all
sides
the
foot
traffic
was
reduced
to
sparse
umbrellas
people
rushing
for
shelter
before
the
deluge
ozone
crackled
in
the
air
and
thunder
roiled
seemingly
up
from
the
ground
deep
and
sickening
they
started
with
a
circuit
of
the
house
looking
for
footprints
body
parts
he
found
a
shred
of
torn
gray
shirt
caught
on
a
rose
bramble
near
the
front
of
his
walk
it
smelled
of
the
homey
warmth
of
edward
innards
and
had
a
few
of
frederick
short
curly
hairs
stuck
to
it
alan
showed
it
to
edward
then
folded
it
into
the
change
pocket
of
his
wallet
they
walked
the
length
of
the
sidewalk
crossed
wales
and
began
to
slowly
cross
the
little
park
edward
circumnavigated
the
little
cement
wading
pool
tracing
the
political
runes
left
behind
by
the
cheerful
anarchist
taggers
painfully
bent
almost
double
at
his
enormous
waist
what
are
we
looking
for
alan
footprints
finger
bones
clues
edward
puffed
back
to
the
bench
and
sat
down
tears
streaming
down
his
face
i
so
he
said
alan
crawling
around
the
torn
sod
left
when
someone
had
dragged
one
of
the
picnic
tables
contained
his
frustration
if
we
can
find
daniel
we
can
get
frederick
and
george
back
okay
all
right
edward
snuffled
the
next
time
alan
looked
up
edward
had
taken
off
his
scuffed
shoes
and
socks
rolled
up
the
cuffs
of
his
pants
and
was
wading
through
the
little
pool
piggy
eyes
cast
downward
good
idea
alan
called
and
turned
to
the
sandbox
a
moment
later
there
was
a
booming
yelp
almost
lost
in
the
roll
of
thunder
and
when
alan
turned
about
edward
was
gone
alan
kicked
off
his
birks
and
splashed
up
to
the
hems
of
his
shorts
in
the
wading
pool
in
the
pool
center
the
round
fountainhead
was
a
twisted
wreck
the
concrete
crumbled
and
the
dry
steel
and
brass
fixtures
contorted
and
ruptured
they
had
long
streaks
of
abraded
skin
torn
shirt
and
blood
on
them
leading
down
into
the
guts
of
the
fountain
cautiously
alan
leaned
over
looking
well
down
the
dark
tunnel
that
had
been
scraped
out
of
the
concrete
centerpiece
the
thin
gray
light
showed
him
the
rough
walls
chipped
out
with
some
kind
of
sharp
tool
edward
he
called
his
voice
did
not
echo
or
bounce
back
to
him
tentatively
he
reached
down
the
tunnel
bending
at
the
waist
over
the
rough
lip
of
the
former
fountain
deep
he
reached
and
reached
and
reached
and
as
his
fingertips
hit
loose
dirt
he
leaned
farther
in
and
groped
blindly
digging
his
hands
into
the
plug
of
soil
that
had
been
shoveled
into
the
tunnel
bend
a
few
feet
below
the
surface
he
straightened
up
and
climbed
in
sinking
to
the
waist
and
tried
to
kick
the
dirt
out
of
the
way
but
it
would
give
the
tunnel
had
caved
in
behind
the
plug
of
earth
he
clambered
out
feeling
the
first
fat
drops
of
rain
on
his
bare
forearms
and
the
crown
of
his
head
there
was
one
in
the
little
coach
house
in
the
back
of
his
place
behind
the
collapsed
boxes
and
the
bicycle
pump
as
he
ran
across
the
street
he
saw
krishna
sitting
on
his
porch
watching
him
with
a
hint
of
a
smile
lost
another
one
huh
he
said
he
looked
as
if
he
been
awake
all
night
now
hovering
on
the
brink
of
sleepiness
and
wiredness
a
roll
of
thunder
crashed
and
a
sheet
of
rain
hurtled
out
of
the
sky
alan
never
thought
of
himself
as
a
violent
person
even
when
he
had
to
throw
the
occasional
troublemaker
out
of
his
shops
he
done
so
with
an
almost
cordial
force
now
though
he
trembled
and
yearned
to
take
krishna
by
the
throat
and
ram
his
head
face
first
into
the
column
that
held
up
his
front
porch
again
and
again
until
his
fingers
were
slick
with
the
blood
from
krishna
shattered
nose
alan
hurried
past
him
his
shoulders
and
fists
clenched
krishna
chuckled
nastily
and
alan
thought
he
knew
who
got
the
job
of
sawing
off
mimi
wings
when
they
grew
too
long
and
thought
too
that
krishna
must
relish
the
task
where
you
going
krishna
called
alan
fumbled
with
his
keyring
desperate
to
get
in
and
get
the
keys
to
the
coach
house
and
to
fetch
the
shovel
before
the
new
tunnels
under
the
park
collapsed
you
too
late
you
know
krishna
continued
you
might
as
well
give
up
too
late
too
late
alan
whirled
and
shrieked
a
wordless
contorted
war
cry
a
sound
from
his
bestial
guts
as
his
eyes
swam
back
into
focus
he
saw
mimi
standing
beside
krishna
barefoot
in
a
faded
housecoat
her
eyes
were
very
wide
and
as
she
turned
away
from
him
he
saw
that
her
stubby
wings
were
splayed
as
wide
as
they
go
forming
a
tent
in
her
robe
that
pulled
it
up
above
her
knees
alan
bit
down
and
clamped
his
lips
together
and
found
his
keys
he
tracked
mud
over
the
polished
floors
and
the
ancient
threadbare
persian
rugs
as
he
ran
to
the
kitchen
snatching
the
keys
from
their
hook
over
the
sink
he
ran
back
across
the
street
to
the
little
park
clutching
his
shovel
he
jammed
his
head
into
the
centerpiece
and
tried
to
see
which
way
the
tunnel
had
curved
off
when
it
turned
but
it
was
too
dark
the
dirt
too
loose
he
pulled
himself
out
and
took
the
shovel
in
his
hands
like
a
spear
and
stabbed
it
into
the
concrete
bed
of
the
wading
pool
listening
for
a
hollowness
in
the
returning
sound
like
a
man
thudding
for
a
stud
under
drywall
the
white
noise
of
the
rain
was
too
high
the
rolling
thunder
too
steady
his
chest
heaved
and
his
tears
mingled
with
the
rain
streaking
down
his
face
as
he
stabbed
again
and
again
at
the
pool
bottom
his
mind
was
scrambled
and
saturated
his
vision
clouded
with
the
humid
mist
rising
off
his
chest
and
the
raindrops
caught
in
his
eyelashes
he
splashed
out
of
the
wading
pool
and
took
the
shovel
to
the
sod
of
the
park
lawn
picking
an
arbitrary
spot
and
digging
inefficiently
and
hysterically
the
bent
shovel
tip
twisting
with
each
stroke
suddenly
strong
hands
were
on
his
shoulders
another
set
prizing
the
shovel
from
his
hands
he
looked
up
and
blinked
his
eyes
clear
looking
into
the
face
of
two
young
asian
police
officers
they
were
bulky
from
the
kevlar
vests
they
wore
under
their
rain
slickers
with
kind
and
exasperated
expressions
on
their
faces
sir
the
one
holding
the
shovel
said
what
are
you
doing
alan
breathed
himself
into
a
semblance
of
composure
i
he
started
then
trailed
off
krishna
was
watching
from
his
porch
grinning
ferociously
holding
a
cordless
phone
the
creature
that
had
howled
at
krishna
before
scrambled
for
purchase
in
alan
chest
alan
averted
his
eyes
from
krishna
grin
he
focused
on
the
cap
of
the
officer
in
front
of
him
shrouded
in
a
clear
plastic
shower
cap
to
keep
its
crown
dry
sorry
he
said
it
was
a
a
dog
a
stray
or
maybe
a
runaway
a
little
scottie
dog
it
jumped
down
the
center
of
the
fountain
there
and
disappeared
i
looked
down
and
thought
it
had
found
a
tunnel
that
caved
in
on
it
the
officer
peered
at
him
from
under
the
brim
of
his
hat
dubiousness
writ
plain
on
his
young
face
a
tunnel
alan
wiped
the
rain
from
his
eyes
tried
to
regain
his
composure
tried
to
find
his
charm
it
was
to
be
found
instead
every
time
he
reached
for
something
witty
and
calming
he
saw
the
streaks
of
blood
and
torn
clothing
dark
on
the
loose
soil
of
the
fountain
center
and
no
sooner
had
he
dispelled
those
images
than
they
were
replaced
with
krishna
sneering
saying
lost
another
one
huh
he
trembled
and
swallowed
a
sob
i
think
i
need
to
sit
down
he
said
as
calmly
as
he
could
and
he
sank
slowly
to
his
knees
the
hands
on
his
biceps
let
him
descend
sir
do
you
live
nearby
one
of
the
cops
asked
close
in
to
his
ear
he
nodded
into
his
hands
which
he
brought
up
to
cover
his
face
across
the
street
he
said
they
helped
him
to
his
feet
and
supported
him
as
he
tottered
weak
and
heaving
to
his
porch
krishna
was
gone
once
they
got
there
the
cops
helped
him
shuck
his
drenched
shoes
and
socks
and
put
him
down
on
the
overstuffed
horsehide
sofa
alan
recovered
himself
with
an
effort
of
will
and
gave
them
his
id
i
sorry
you
must
think
i
an
absolute
lunatic
he
said
shivering
in
his
wet
clothes
sir
the
cop
who
taken
the
shovel
from
him
said
we
see
absolute
lunatics
every
day
i
think
you
just
a
little
upset
we
all
go
a
little
nuts
from
time
to
time
yeah
alan
said
yeah
a
little
nuts
i
had
a
long
night
last
night
family
problems
the
cops
shifted
their
weight
showering
the
floor
with
raindrops
that
beaded
on
the
finish
are
you
going
to
be
all
right
on
your
own
we
can
call
someone
if
like
no
alan
said
pasting
on
a
weak
smile
no
that
all
right
i
be
fine
i
going
to
change
into
some
dry
clothes
and
clean
up
and
oh
i
do
know
get
some
sleep
i
think
i
could
use
some
sleep
that
sounds
like
an
excellent
idea
the
cop
who
taken
the
shovel
said
he
looked
around
at
the
bookcases
you
read
all
of
these
he
asked
naw
alan
said
falling
into
the
rote
response
from
his
proprietorship
of
the
bookstore
what
the
point
of
a
bunch
of
books
you
already
read
the
joke
reminded
him
of
better
times
and
he
smiled
a
genuine
smile
though
the
stinging
hot
shower
revived
him
somewhat
he
kept
quickening
into
panic
at
the
thought
of
david
creeping
into
his
house
in
the
night
stumping
in
on
desiccated
black
snaggled
rictus
under
mummified
lips
he
spooked
at
imagined
noises
and
thudding
rain
and
the
dry
creaking
of
the
old
house
as
he
toweled
off
and
dressed
there
was
no
phone
in
the
mountain
no
way
to
speak
to
his
remaining
brothers
the
golems
his
parents
he
balled
his
fists
and
stood
in
the
center
of
his
bedroom
shaking
with
impotent
worry
david
none
of
them
had
liked
david
very
much
billy
the
had
been
born
with
a
quiet
wisdom
an
eerie
solemnity
that
had
made
him
easy
for
the
young
alan
to
care
for
carlos
the
island
had
crawled
out
of
their
mother
womb
and
pulled
himself
to
the
cave
mouth
and
up
the
face
of
their
father
lying
there
for
ten
years
accreting
until
he
was
ready
to
push
off
on
his
own
but
daniel
daniel
had
been
a
hateful
child
from
the
day
he
was
born
he
was
colicky
and
his
screams
echoed
through
their
father
caverns
he
screamed
from
the
moment
he
emerged
and
alan
tipped
him
over
and
toweled
him
gently
dry
and
he
did
stop
for
an
entire
year
alan
stopped
being
able
to
tell
day
from
night
lost
track
of
the
weeks
and
months
developed
a
taste
for
food
real
people
food
that
he
buy
in
town
at
the
loblaws
superstore
but
he
could
leave
davey
alone
in
the
cave
and
he
certainly
could
carry
the
howling
shitting
puking
pissing
filthy
baby
into
town
with
him
so
they
ate
what
the
golems
brought
them
sweet
grasses
soft
berries
frozen
winter
fruit
dug
from
the
base
of
the
orchards
in
town
blind
winter
fish
from
the
streams
they
drank
snowmelt
and
ate
pine
cones
and
the
baby
davey
cried
and
cried
until
alan
could
remember
what
it
was
to
live
in
a
world
of
words
and
conversations
and
thought
and
reflection
no
one
knew
what
to
do
about
davey
their
father
blew
warm
winds
scented
with
coal
dust
and
loam
to
calm
him
but
still
davey
cried
their
mother
rocked
him
on
her
gentlest
spin
cycle
but
still
davey
cried
alan
walked
down
the
slope
to
carl
landmass
growing
with
the
dust
and
rains
and
snow
and
set
him
down
on
the
soft
grass
and
earth
there
but
still
davey
cried
and
carlos
inched
farther
and
farther
toward
the
lawrence
seaway
sluggishly
making
his
way
out
to
the
ocean
and
as
far
away
from
the
baby
as
possible
after
his
first
birthday
david
started
taking
breaks
from
his
screaming
learning
to
crawl
and
then
totter
becoming
a
holy
terror
if
alan
left
his
schoolbooks
within
reach
of
the
boy
they
be
reduced
to
shreds
of
damp
mulch
in
minutes
by
the
time
he
was
two
his
head
was
exactly
at
alan
crotch
height
and
he
greet
his
brother
on
his
return
from
school
by
charging
at
full
speed
into
alan
nuts
propelled
at
unlikely
speed
on
his
thin
legs
at
three
he
took
to
butchering
animals
the
rabbits
that
little
bill
kept
in
stacked
hutches
outside
of
the
cave
mouth
went
first
billy
rushed
home
from
his
class
eyes
crazed
with
precognition
and
found
david
methodically
wringing
the
animals
necks
and
then
slicing
them
open
with
a
bit
of
sharpened
chert
billy
had
showed
david
how
to
knap
flint
and
chert
the
week
before
after
seeing
a
filmstrip
about
it
in
class
he
kicked
the
makeshift
knife
out
of
davey
hand
breaking
his
thumb
with
the
toe
of
the
hard
leather
shoes
the
golems
had
made
for
him
and
left
davey
to
bawl
in
the
cave
while
billy
dignified
his
corpses
putting
their
entrails
back
inside
their
bodies
and
wrapping
them
in
shrouds
made
from
old
diapers
alan
helped
him
bury
them
and
then
found
davey
and
taped
his
thumb
to
his
hand
and
spanked
him
until
his
arm
was
too
tired
to
deal
out
one
more
wallop
alan
made
his
way
down
to
the
living
room
the
floor
streaked
with
mud
and
water
he
went
into
the
kitchen
and
filled
a
bucket
with
soapy
water
and
gathered
up
an
armload
of
rags
from
the
rag
bag
methodically
he
cleaned
away
the
mud
he
turned
his
sopping
shoes
on
end
over
the
grate
and
dialed
the
thermostat
higher
he
made
himself
a
bowl
of
granola
and
a
cup
of
coffee
and
sat
down
at
his
old
wooden
kitchen
table
and
ate
mindlessly
then
washed
the
dishes
and
put
them
in
the
drying
rack
he
have
to
go
speak
to
krishna
natalie
answered
the
door
in
a
pretty
sun
dress
combat
boots
and
a
baseball
hat
she
eyed
him
warily
i
like
to
speak
to
krishna
alan
said
from
under
the
hood
of
his
poncho
there
was
an
awkward
silence
finally
natalie
said
he
not
home
i
do
believe
you
alan
said
and
it
urgent
and
i
not
in
the
mood
to
play
around

for
me
natalie
i
told

said

his
eyes

enough
alan
said
in
his
boss
voice
his
voice
get
him
natalie
you
do
need
to
be
in
the
middle
of
this
it
not
right
for
him
to
ask
you
to
get
him
natalie
closed
the
door
and
he
heard
the
deadbolt
turn
she
going
to
fetch
him
or
is
she
locking
me
out
he
was
on
the
verge
of
hammering
the
buzzer
again
but
he
got
his
answer
krishna
opened
the
door
and
stepped
onto
the
dripping
porch
bulling
alan
out
with
his
chest
he
smiled
grimly
at
alan
and
made
a
gesture
what
did
you
see
alan
said
his
voice
tight
but
under
control
saw
you
and
that
fat
guy
krishna
said
saw
you
rooting
around
in
the
park
saw
him
disappear
down
the
fountain
he
my
brother
alan
said
so

he
ai
heavy
he
fat
but
i
expect
there
a
reason
for
that
i
seen
your
kind
before
adam
i
do
like
you
and
i
owe
you
any
favors
he
turned
and
reached
for
the
screen
door
no
alan
said
taking
him
by
the
wrist
squeezing
harder
than
was
necessary
not
yet
you
said
another
one
what
other
one
krishna
what
else
did
you
see
krishna
gnawed
on
his
neatly
trimmed
soul
patch
let
go
of
me
andrew
he
said
almost
too
softly
to
be
heard
over
the
rain
tell
me
what
you
saw
alan
said
tell
me
and
i
let
you
go
his
other
hand
balled
into
a
fist
goddammit
alan
yelled
and
twisted
krishna
arm
behind
his
back
i
called
the
cops
krishna
said
i
called
them
again
and
they
on
their
way
let
me
go
freak
show
i
do
like
you
either
krishna
alan
said
twisting
the
arm
higher
he
let
go
suddenly
then
stumbled
back
as
krishna
scraped
the
heel
of
his
motorcycle
boot
down
his
shin
and
hammered
it
into
the
top
of
his
foot
he
dropped
to
one
knee
and
grabbed
his
foot
while
krishna
slipped
into
the
house
and
shot
the
lock
then
he
hobbled
home
as
quickly
as
he
could
he
tried
to
pace
off
the
ache
in
his
foot
but
the
throbbing
got
worse
so
he
made
himself
a
drippy
ice
pack
and
sat
on
the
sofa
in
the
immaculate
living
room
and
rocked
back
and
forth
holding
the
ice
to
his
bare
foot
at
five
davey
graduated
from
torturing
animals
to
beating
up
on
smaller
children
alan
took
him
down
to
the
school
on
the
day
after
labor
day
to
sign
him
up
for
kindergarten
he
was
wearing
his
stiff
new
blue
jeans
and
sneakers
his
knapsack
stuffed
with
fresh
binders
and
pencils
finding
out
about
these
things
had
been
alan
first
experience
with
the
wide
world
a
kindergartner
sizing
up
his
surroundings
at
speed
so
that
he
could
try
to
fit
in
david
was
a
cute
kid
and
had
the
benefit
of
alan
experience
he
had
a
foxy
little
face
and
shaggy
blond
hair
all
clever
smiles
and
awkward
winks
and
for
all
that
he
was
still
a
monster
they
came
and
got
alan
twenty
minutes
after
classes
started
when
his
new
teacher
was
still
briefing
them
on
the
rules
and
regulations
for
junior
high
students
he
was
painfully
aware
of
all
the
eyes
on
his
back
as
he
followed
the
office
lady
out
of
the
portable
and
into
the
old
school
building
where
the
kindergarten
and
the
administration
was
housed
we
need
to
reach
your
parents
the
office
lady
said
once
they
were
alone
in
the
empty
hallways
of
the
old
building
you
ca
alan
said
they
do
have
a
phone
then
we
can
drive
out
to
see
them
the
office
lady
said
she
smelled
of
artificial
floral
scent
and
ivory
soap
like
the
female
hygiene
aisle
at
the
drugstore
mom
still
real
sick
alan
said
sticking
to
his
traditional
story
your
father
then
the
office
lady
said
he
had
variations
on
this
conversation
with
every
office
lady
at
the
school
and
he
knew
he
win
it
in
the
end
meantime
what
did
they
want
my
dad
you
know
gone
he
said
since
i
was
a
little
kid
that
line
always
got
the
office
ladies
since
i
was
a
little
kid
made
them
want
to
write
it
down
for
their
family
christmas
newsletters
the
office
lady
smiled
a
powdery
smile
and
put
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
all
right
alan
come
with
me
davey
was
sitting
on
the
dusty
sofa
in
the
vice
principal
office
he
punched
the
sofa
cushion
rhythmically
alan
he
said
when
the
office
lady
led
him
in
hi
dave
alan
said
what
going
on
they
stupid
here
i
hate
them
he
gave
the
sofa
a
particularly
vicious
punch
i
get
mr
davenport
the
office
lady
said
and
closed
the
door
behind
her
what
did
you
do
alan
asked
she
would
let
me
play
david
said
glaring
at
him
who
would
a
girl
she
had
the
blocks
and
i
wanted
to
play
with
them
and
she
would
let
me
what
did
you
hit
her
with
alan
asked
dreading
the
answer
a
block
david
said
suddenly
and
murderously
cheerful
i
hit
her
in
the
eye
alan
groaned
the
door
opened
and
the
vice
principal
davenport
came
in
and
sat
behind
his
desk
he
was
the
punishment
man
the
one
that
no
one
wanted
to
be
sent
in
to
see
hello
alan
he
said
gravely
alan
had
ever
been
personally
called
before
davenport
but
billy
got
into
some
spot
of
precognitive
trouble
from
time
to
time
rushing
out
of
class
to
stop
some
disaster
at
home
or
somewhere
else
in
the
school
davenport
knew
that
alan
was
a
straight
arrow
not
someone
he
ever
need
to
personally
take
an
interest
in
he
crouched
down
next
to
darren
hitching
up
his
slacks
you
must
be
david
he
said
ducking
down
low
to
meet
davey
downcast
gaze
davey
punched
the
sofa
i
davenport
he
said
and
extended
a
hand
with
a
big
class
ring
on
it
and
a
smaller
wedding
band
davey
kicked
him
in
the
nose
and
the
vice
principal
toppled
over
backward
whacking
his
head
on
the
sharp
corner
of
his
desk
he
tumbled
over
onto
his
side
and
clutched
his
head
he
gasped
and
davey
giggled
maniacally
alan
grabbed
davey
wrist
and
bent
his
arm
behind
his
back
shoving
him
across
his
knee
he
swatted
the
little
boy
on
the
ass
as
hard
as
he
could
three
times
do
you
ever
alan
began
the
vice
principal
sat
up
still
clutching
his
head
that
enough
he
said
catching
alan
arm
sorry
alan
said
and
david
sorry
too
right
he
glared
at
david
you
a
stupid
david
said
and
squirmed
off
of
lap
the
vice
principal
lips
tightened
alan
he
said
quietly
take
your
brother
into
the
hallway
i
am
going
to
write
a
note
that
your
mother
will
have
to
sign
before
david
comes
back
to
school
after
his
suspension
david
glared
at
them
each
in
turn
i
not
coming
back
to
this
place
he
said
he
did
the
rain
let
up
by
afternoon
leaving
a
crystalline
air
hanging
over
the
market
andrew
sat
in
his
office
by
his
laptop
and
watched
the
sun
come
out
he
needed
to
find
ed
needed
to
find
frank
needed
to
find
grant
but
he
was
out
of
practice
when
it
came
to
the
ways
of
the
mountain
and
its
sons
whenever
he
tried
to
imagine
a
thing
to
do
next
his
mind
spun
and
the
worldless
howling
thing
inside
him
stirred
the
more
he
tried
to
remember
what
it
was
like
to
be
a
son
of
the
mountain
the
more
he
felt
something
he
worked
very
hard
for
his
delicate
normalcy
slipping
away
so
he
put
his
soaked
clothes
in
the
dryer
clamped
his
laptop
under
his
arm
and
went
out
he
moped
around
the
park
and
the
fountain
but
the
stroller
moms
whose
tots
were
splashing
in
the
wading
pool
gave
him
sufficient
dirty
looks
that
he
walked
up
to
the
greek
took
a
table
on
the
patio
and
ordered
a
murderously
strong
cup
of
coffee
he
opened
up
the
screen
and
rotated
around
the
little
table
until
the
screen
was
in
the
shade
and
his
wireless
card
was
aligned
for
best
reception
from
the
yagi
antenna
poking
out
of
his
back
window
he
opened
up
a
browser
and
hit
mapquest
then
brought
up
a
map
of
the
market
he
pasted
it
into
his
cad
app
and
started
to
mark
it
up
noting
all
the
different
approaches
to
his
house
that
davey
might
take
the
next
time
he
came
the
maps
soothed
him
made
him
feel
like
a
part
of
the
known
world
augusta
avenue
and
oxford
were
both
out
even
after
midnight
when
the
stores
were
all
shuttered
there
was
far
too
much
foot
traffic
for
davey
to
pass
by
unnoticed
but
the
alleys
that
mazed
the
back
ways
were
ideal
some
were
fenced
off
some
were
too
narrow
to
pass
but
most
of
them
he
tried
to
navigate
them
by
bicycle
once
and
found
himself
utterly
lost
he
had
to
turn
around
slowly
until
he
spotted
the
cn
tower
and
use
it
to
get
his
bearings
he
poked
at
the
map
sipping
the
coffee
then
ordering
another
from
the
greek
son
who
had
yet
figured
out
that
he
was
a
regular
and
so
sneered
at
his
laptop
with
undisguised
contempt
computers
huh
he
said
does
anyone
just
read
a
book
anymore
i
used
to
own
a
bookstore
alan
said
then
held
up
a
finger
and
moused
over
to
his
photo
album
and
brought
up
the
thumbnails
of
his
old
bookstore
see
the
greek
son
thirty
with
a
paunch
and
under
the
pits
of
his
white
the
greek
sat
down
and
looked
at
the
photos
i
remember
that
place
on
harbord
street
right
alan
smiled
yup
we
lost
the
store
when
they
blew
up
the
abortion
clinic
next
door
he
said
insurance
paid
out
but
i
was
ready
to
start
over
with
another
bookstore
the
greek
son
shook
his
head
another
coffee
right
right
alan
said
alan
went
back
to
the
map
realigning
the
laptop
for
optimal
reception
again
you
got
a
wireless
card
in
that
a
young
guy
at
the
next
table
asked
he
was
dressed
in
kensington
market
chic
tatts
and
facial
piercings
bunchoffuckinggoofs
tee
cutoffs
and
sweaty
high
boots
draped
with
chains
yeah
alan
said
he
sighed
and
closed
the
map
window
he
getting
anywhere
anyway
and
you
get
service
here
where
your
access
point
or
no
he
sounded
as
nerdy
as
any
of
the
you
find
shopping
for
bargains
on
cd
blanks
on
college
street
three
blocks
that
way
alan
said
pointing
hanging
off
my
house
the
network
name
is
shit
that
you
the
kid
said
goddammit
you
clobbering
our
access
points
what
access
point
access
parasitenet
he
indicated
a
peeling
sticker
on
the
lapel
of
his
leather
jacket
showing
a
skull
with
crossed
radio
towers
underneath
it
i
trying
to
get
a
running
though
all
of
the
market
and
you
hammering
me
jesus
i
was
ready
to
rat
you
out
to
the
radio
cops
at
the
canadian
radio
and
television
commission
dude
you
got
to
turn
down
the
freaking
on
those
things
what
a
the
kid
moved
his
beer
over
to
alan
table
and
sat
down
okay
so
pretend
that
your
laptop
is
the
access
point
it
radiates
more
or
less
equally
in
all
directions
depending
on
your
antenna
characteristics
and
leaving
out
the
rf
shadows
that
microwaves
and
stucco
and
cordless
phones
generate
he
arranged
the
coffee
cup
and
the
beer
at
equal
distances
from
the
laptop
then
moved
them
around
to
demonstrate
the
coverage
area
right
so
what
happens
if
i
out
of
range
over
he
put
his
beer
back
on
his
own
table
and
you
want
to
reach
me
well
you
could
just
turn
up
the
gain
on
your
access
point
either
by
increasing
the
power
so
that
it
radiates
farther
in
all
directions
or
by
focusing
the
transmissions
so
they
travel
farther
in
a
line
of
sight
right
alan
said
sipping
his
coffee
right
so
both
of
those
approaches
suck
if
you
turn
up
the
power
you
radiate
over
everyone
else
signal
so
if
i
got
an
access
point
he
held
his
fist
between
their
tables
no
one
can
hear
it
because
you
drowning
it
out
it
like
you
shouting
so
loud
that
no
one
else
can
carry
on
a
conversation
so
why
do
you
just
use
my
network
i
want
to
be
able
to
get
online
anywhere
in
the
market
but
that
means
that
anyone
can
right
the
waved
his
hand
dismissively
sure
whatever
but
what
happens
if
your
network
gets
shut
down
or
if
you
decide
to
start
eavesdropping
on
other
people
or
if
someone
wants
to
get
to
the
printer
in
her
living
room
it
no
good
so
what
you
want
me
to
switch
to
focused
antennae
that
no
good
if
you
used
a
focused
signal
you
going
to
have
to
be
perfectly
aligned
if
you
going
to
talk
back
to
your
base
so
unless
you
want
to
provide
a
connection
to
one
tiny
pinpoint
somewhere
a
couple
kilometers
away
it
wo
do
you
any
good
there
no
solution
then
i
should
just
give
up
the
held
up
his
hands
hell
no
there
just
no
solution
you
ca
be
superman
blanketing
the
whole
world
with
wireless
using
your
almighty
antennaprick
but
so
what
that
what
mesh
networks
are
for
check
it
out
he
arranged
the
beer
and
the
laptop
and
the
coffee
cup
so
that
they
were
strung
out
along
a
straight
line
okay
you
the
laptop
and
i
the
coffee
cup
we
both
have
a
radio
and
we
want
to
talk
to
each
other
we
turn
up
the
gain
on
our
radios
so
that
they
can
shout
loud
enough
to
be
heard
at
this
distance
but
that
would
drown
out
this
guy
here
he
gestured
at
the
beer
we
use
a
focused
antenna
but
if
i
move
a
little
bit
off
the
beam
he
nudged
the
coffee
cup
to
one
side
we
dead
but
there
a
third
solution
we
ask
the
beer
to
pass
messages
around
fucking
right
we
do
that
the
mesh
part
every
station
on
the
network
gets
radios
one
for
talking
in
one
direction
the
other
for
relaying
in
the
other
direction
the
more
stations
you
add
the
lower
the
power
on
each
radio
and
the
more
pathways
you
get
to
carry
your
data
alan
shook
his
head
it
a
fuckin
is
it
sure
alan
said
sure
but
does
it
work
do
all
those
hops
between
point
and
point
slow
down
the
connection
a
little
sure
not
so
you
notice
they
do
have
to
go
that
far
the
farthest
any
of
these
signals
has
to
travel
is
front
street
what
at
front
torix
the
main
network
interchange
for
the
whole
city
we
stick
an
antenna
out
a
window
there
and
downlink
it
into
the
cage
where
uunet
and
psinet
meet
voila
instant
freenet
where
do
you
get
the
money
for
that
who
said
anything
about
money
how
much
do
you
think
uunet
and
psi
charge
each
other
to
exchange
traffic
with
one
another
who
benefits
when
uunet
and
psi
is
uunet
the
beneficiary
of
traffic
or
vice
versa
internet
access
only
costs
money
at
the
and
with
a
there
is
no
edge
anymore
it
penetration
at
the
center
just
like
the
devo
song
i
adrian
alan
said
i
kurt
the
said
buy
me
a
beer
adrian
it
be
my
pleasure
alan
said
kurt
lived
in
the
back
of
a
storefront
on
oxford
the
front
were
a
maze
of
peeling
shelving
units
piled
high
with
junk
tech
ancient
software
stacked
up
hard
drives
cables
and
tapes
and
removable
media
alan
tried
to
imagine
making
sense
of
it
all
flowing
it
into
the
inventory
and
felt
something
like
vertigo
in
a
small
hollow
carved
out
of
the
back
kurt
had
arranged
a
cluttered
desk
a
scuffed
twin
bed
and
a
rack
of
milk
crates
filled
with
and
underwear
alan
picked
his
way
delicately
through
the
store
and
found
himself
a
seat
on
an
upturned
milk
crate
kurt
sat
on
the
bed
and
grinned
expectantly
so
he
said
so
what
alan
said
so
what
is
is
it
great
well
you
sure
have
a
lot
of
i
give
you
that
alan
said
it
all
dumpstered
kurt
said
casually
oh
you
dive
alan
said
i
used
to
dive
it
was
mostly
true
alan
had
always
been
a
picker
always
on
the
lookout
for
bargoons
even
if
they
were
sticking
out
of
someone
trash
bin
sometimes
if
they
were
sticking
out
of
someone
trash
bin
seeing
what
normal
people
threw
away
gave
him
a
rare
glimpse
into
their
lives
kurt
walked
over
to
the
nearest
shelving
unit
and
grabbed
a
pc
with
the
lid
off
but
did
you
ever
do
this
he
stuck
the
machine
under
alan
nose
and
swung
the
gooseneck
desk
lamp
over
it
it
was
a
pc
generic
commodity
hardware
with
a
couple
of
network
cards
what
that
it
a
junk
access
point
i
made
it
out
of
trash
the
only
thing
i
bought
were
the
network
cards
two
wireless
one
ethernet
running
a
freebsd
distribution
off
a
cd
so
the
os
can
never
get
corrupted
it
got
lots
of
sweet
stuff
in
the
distro
and
all
you
need
to
do
is
plug
it
in
point
the
antennae
in
opposite
directions
and
you
up
it
does
its
own
power
management
it
automagically
peers
with
other
access
points
if
it
can
find
and
it
does
its
own
dynamic
channel
selection
to
avoid
stepping
on
other
access
points
alan
turned
his
head
this
way
and
that
making
admiring
noises
you
made
this
huh
for
about
eighty
bucks
it
my
fifteenth
box
eventually
i
wan
na
have
a
couple
hundred
of
these
ambitious
alan
said
handing
the
box
back
how
do
you
pay
for
the
parts
you
have
to
buy
do
you
have
a
grant
a
grant
shit
no
i
got
a
bunch
of
street
kids
who
come
in
and
take
digital
pix
of
the
stuff
i
have
no
use
for
research
them
online
and
post
them
to
ebay
i
split
the
take
with
them
brings
in
a
couple
grand
a
week
and
i
keeping
about
fifty
street
kids
fed
besides
i
go
diving
three
times
a
week
out
in
concord
and
oakville
and
richmond
hill
anywhere
i
can
find
an
industrial
park
if
i
had
room
i
recruit
fifty
more
kids
i
bringing
it
in
faster
than
they
can
sell
it
why
do
you
just
do
less
diving
are
you
kidding
me
it
all
i
can
do
not
to
go
out
every
night
you
would
believe
the
stuff
i
find
all
i
can
think
about
is
all
the
stuff
i
missing
out
on
some
days
i
wish
that
my
kids
were
less
honest
if
they
ripped
off
some
stuff
i
have
room
for
a
lot
more
alan
laughed
worry
for
edward
and
frederick
and
george
nagged
at
him
impotent
anxiety
but
this
was
just
so
fascinating
fascinating
and
distracting
and
if
not
normal
at
least
not
nearly
so
strange
as
he
could
be
he
imagined
the
city
gridded
up
with
junk
equipment
radiating
internet
access
from
the
lakeshore
to
the
outer
suburbs
the
grandiosity
took
his
breath
away
look
kurt
said
spreading
out
a
map
of
kensington
market
on
the
unmade
bed
i
got
access
points
here
here
here
and
here
another
eight
or
ten
and
i
have
the
whole
market
covered
then
i
going
to
head
north
cover
the
u
of
t
campus
and
push
east
towards
yonge
street
bay
street
and
university
avenue
are
going
to
be
tough
how
can
i
convince
bankers
to
let
me
plug
this
by
their
windows
kurt
alan
said
i
suspect
that
the
journey
to
university
avenue
is
going
to
be
a
lot
slower
than
you
expect
it
to
be
kurt
jutted
his
jaw
out
what
that
supposed
to
mean
there
a
lot
of
real
estate
between
here
and
there
a
lot
of
trees
and
office
towers
and
empty
lots
you
going
to
have
to
knock
on
doors
every
couple
hundred
meters
at
best
and
convince
them
to
let
you
install
one
of
these
boxes
made
from
garbage
and
plug
it
in
to
participate
in
what
democratic
communication
kurt
said
ah
well
my
guess
is
that
most
of
the
people
who
you
need
to
convince
wo
really
care
much
about
that
wo
be
able
to
make
that
abstract
notion
concrete
kurt
mumbled
into
his
chest
alan
could
see
that
he
was
fuming
just
because
you
do
have
the
vision
to
appreciate
this
alan
held
up
his
hand
stop
right
there
i
never
said
anything
of
the
sort
i
think
that
this
is
big
and
exciting
and
looks
like
a
lot
of
fun
i
think
that
ringing
doorbells
and
talking
people
into
letting
me
nail
an
access
point
to
their
walls
sounds
like
a
of
fun
really
i
not
kidding
but
this
is
a
journey
not
a
destination
the
value
you
get
out
of
this
will
be
more
in
the
doing
than
the
having
done
the
having
going
to
take
decades
i
guess
but
the
doing
going
to
be
something
alan
smile
was
so
broad
it
ached
the
idea
had
seized
him
he
was
drunk
on
it
the
buzzer
sounded
and
kurt
got
up
to
answer
it
alan
craned
his
neck
to
see
a
pair
of
bearded
neohippies
in
rasta
hats
are
you
kurt
one
asked
yeah
dude
i
kurt
marcel
told
us
that
we
could
make
some
money
here
we
trying
to
raise
bus
fare
to
burning
man
we
could
really
use
the
work
not
today
but
maybe
tomorrow
kurt
said
come
by
around
lunchtime
you
sure
you
ca
use
us
today
not
today
kurt
said
i
busy
today
all
right
the
other
said
and
they
slouched
away
word
of
mouth
kurt
said
with
a
jingling
shrug
kids
just
turn
up
looking
for
work
with
the
trash
you
think
they
come
back
tomorrow
alan
was
pretty
good
at
evaluating
kids
and
they
had
looked
very
reliable
those
two
chance
tell
you
what
though
there
always
enough
kids
and
enough
junk
to
go
around
but
you
need
to
make
arrangements
to
get
your
access
points
mounted
and
powered
you
got
to
sort
it
out
with
people
who
own
stores
and
houses
you
want
to
knock
on
doors
kurt
said
i
think
i
would
alan
said
i
suspect
it
a
possibility
we
can
start
with
the
shopkeepers
though
i
have
had
much
luck
with
merchants
kurt
said
shrugging
his
shoulders
his
chains
jingled
and
a
whiff
of
armpit
wafted
across
the
claustrophobic
hollow
capitalist
pigs
i
ca
imagine
why
alan
said
wales
avenue
huh
kurt
said
they
were
walking
down
oxford
street
and
alan
was
seeing
it
with
fresh
eyes
casting
his
gaze
upward
looking
at
the
lines
of
sight
from
one
building
to
another
mentally
painting
in
shadows
cast
by
the
transformers
on
the
light
poles
just
moved
in
on
july
first
alan
said
still
getting
settled
in
which
house
the
blue
one
with
the
big
porch
on
the
corner
sure
i
know
it
i
scored
some
great
plumbing
fixtures
out
of
the
dumpster
there
last
winter
you
welcome
alan
said
they
turned
at
spadina
and
picked
their
way
around
the
tourist
crowds
shopping
the
chinese
importers
sidewalk
displays
of
bamboo
parasols
and
hello
kitty
slippers
past
the
windows
of
the
restaurants
and
the
smell
of
fresh
pork
buns
alan
bought
a
condensed
milk
and
kiwi
from
a
sidewalk
vendor
and
offered
to
treat
kurt
but
he
declined
you
never
know
about
those
places
kurt
said
how
clean
is
their
ice
anyway
where
do
they
wash
their
utensils
you
dig
around
in
dumpsters
for
a
living
alan
said
are
you
immune
to
germs
kurt
turned
at
baldwin
and
alan
followed
i
do
eat
garbage
i
pick
it
he
said
he
sounded
angry
hey
sorry
alan
said
sorry
i
did
mean
to
imply
i
know
you
did
kurt
said
stopping
in
front
of
a
store
and
spooning
candied
ginger
into
a
baggie
he
handed
it
to
the
matron
of
the
shop
who
dropped
it
on
her
scale
and
dusted
her
hands
on
her
black
dress
kurt
handed
her
a
coin
and
took
the
bag
back
i
just
touchy
okay
my
last
girlfriend
split
because
she
could
get
past
it
no
matter
how
much
i
showered
i
was
never
clean
enough
for
her
sorry
alan
said
again
i
heard
something
weird
about
that
blue
house
on
the
corner
kurt
said
one
of
my
kids
told
me
this
morning
he
saw
something
last
night
when
he
was
in
the
park
alan
pulled
up
short
nearly
colliding
with
a
trio
of
cute
university
girls
in
pushing
full
of
fish
and
bags
of
soft
steaming
bagels
they
stepped
around
him
lugging
their
groceries
over
the
curb
and
back
onto
the
sidewalk
not
breaking
from
their
discussion
what
was
it
kurt
gave
him
a
sideways
look
it
weird
okay
the
kid
who
saw
it
is
never
all
that
reliable
and
he
likes
to
embellish
okay
alan
said
the
crowd
was
pushing
around
them
now
trying
to
get
past
the
lady
sucked
her
teeth
in
annoyance
so
this
kid
he
was
smoking
a
joint
in
the
park
last
night
really
late
after
the
clubs
shut
down
he
was
alone
and
he
saw
what
he
thought
was
a
dog
dragging
a
garbage
bag
down
the
steps
of
your
house
yes
so
he
went
over
to
take
a
look
and
he
saw
that
it
was
too
big
to
be
a
garbage
bag
and
the
dog
it
looked
sick
it
moved
wrong
he
took
another
step
closer
and
he
must
have
triggered
a
motion
sensor
because
the
porch
light
switched
on
he
says
what
he
not
very
reliable
he
says
it
was
a
dog
he
said
it
was
like
a
mummy
or
something
and
it
had
its
teeth
sunk
into
the
neck
of
this
big
fat
naked
guy
and
it
was
dragging
the
fat
guy
out
into
the
street
when
the
light
came
on
though
it
gave
the
fat
guy
neck
a
hard
shake
then
let
go
and
turned
on
this
kid
walking
toward
him
on
stumpy
little
feet
he
says
it
made
a
kind
of
growling
noise
and
lifted
up
its
hand
like
it
was
going
to
slap
the
kid
and
the
kid
screamed
and
ran
off
when
he
got
to
dundas
he
turned
around
and
saw
the
fat
guy
get
dragged
into
an
alley
between
two
of
the
stores

augusta

cauliflower
and
other
toppings
that

never

a
great
show
of
indifference

his
head

you

of
blood
feuds
natalie
and
link
exchanged
a
significant
look
i
know
it
sounds
ridiculous
you
do
need
to
be
involved
i
just
wanted
to
let
you
know
why
i
acted
so
strangely
last
night
we

get
back
natalie
said
nice
to
meet
you
kurt
i
hope
you
find
your
brother
andy
brothers
alan
said
brothers
natalie
said
and
walked
away
briskly
alan
was
the
oldest
of
the
brothers
and
that
meant
that
he
was
the
one
who
blazed
all
the
new
trails
in
the
family
he
met
a
girl
in
the
seventh
grade
her
name
was
marci
and
she
had
just
transferred
in
from
scotland
her
father
was
a
mining
engineer
and
she
led
a
gypsy
life
that
put
her
in
stark
contrast
to
the
homebodies
that
made
up
most
of
the
rest
of
their
class
she
had
red
hair
and
blue
eyes
and
a
way
of
holding
her
face
in
repose
that
made
her
look
cunning
at
all
times
no
one
understood
her
accent
but
there
was
a
wiry
ferocity
in
her
movement
that
warned
off
any
kid
who
thought
about
teasing
her
about
it
alan
liked
to
play
in
a
marshy
corner
of
the
woods
that
bordered
the
playground
after
school
crawling
around
in
the
weeds
catching
toads
and
letting
them
go
again
spying
on
the
crickets
and
the
secret
lives
of
the
larvae
that
grubbed
in
the
milkweed
he
was
hunkered
down
on
his
haunches
one
afternoon
when
marci
came
crunching
through
the
tall
grass
he
ducked
down
lower
then
peered
out
from
his
hiding
spot
as
she
crouched
down
and
he
heard
the
unmistakable
patter
of
urine
as
she
peed
in
the
rushes
his
jaw
dropped
he
never
seen
a
girl
pee
before
had
no
idea
what
the
squatting
business
was
all
about
the
wet
ground
sucked
at
his
sneaker
and
he
tipped
back
on
his
ass
with
a
yelp
marci
straightened
abruptly
and
crashed
over
to
him
kicking
him
hard
in
the
ribs
when
she
reached
him
leaving
a
muddy
toeprint
on
his
fall
windbreaker
she
wound
up
for
another
kick
and
he
hollered
something
wordless
and
scurried
back
smearing
marsh
mud
across
his
jeans
and
jacket
you
pervert
she
said
pronouncing
it
yuh
peervurrt
i
am
not
he
said
still
scooting
back
watching
from
the
bushes
she
said
i
was
i
was
already
here
and
you
i
mean
what
were
doing
i
was
just
minding
my
own
business
and
you
came
by
i
just
want
to
be
bothered
this
is
place
you
do
own
it
she
said
but
she
sounded
slightly
chastened
tell
anyone
i
had
a
piss
here
all
right
i
wo
he
said
she
sat
down
beside
him
unmindful
of
the
mud
on
her
denim
skirt
promise
she
said
it
so
embarrassing
i
promise
he
said
swear
she
said
and
poked
him
in
the
ribs
with
a
bony
finger
he
clutched
his
hands
to
his
ribs
look
he
said
i
swear
i
good
at
secrets
her
eyes
narrowed
slightly
oh
aye
and
i
suppose
you
lots
of
secrets
then
he
said
nothing
and
worked
at
keeping
the
smile
off
the
corners
of
his
mouth
she
poked
him
in
the
ribs
then
got
him
in
the
stomach
as
he
moved
to
protect
his
chest
secrets
huh
he
shook
his
head
and
clamped
his
lips
shut
she
jabbed
a
flurry
of
pokes
and
prods
at
him
while
he
scooted
back
on
his
butt
then
dug
her
clawed
hands
into
his
tummy
and
tickled
him
viciously
he
giggled
then
laughed
then
started
to
hiccup
uncontrollably
he
shoved
her
away
roughly
and
got
up
on
his
knees
gagging
oh
i
like
you
she
said
just
look
at
that
a
wee
tickle
and
ready
to
toss
your
lunch
she
tenderly
stroked
his
hair
until
the
hiccups
subsided
then
clawed
at
his
belly
again
sending
him
rolling
through
the
mud
once
he
struggled
to
his
feet
he
looked
at
her
panting
why
are
you
doing
this
you
not
serious
it
the
most
fun
i
had
since
we
moved
to
this
terrible
place
you
a
sadist
he
learned
the
word
from
a
book
he
bought
from
the
pile
out
front
of
the
used
bookstore
it
had
a
recipe
for
liver
cutlets
between
the
pages
and
lots
of
squishy
sex
things
that
seemed
improbable
if
not
laughable
he
looked
sadist
up
in
the
class
dictionary
aye
she
said
i
that
she
made
claws
of
her
hands
and
advanced
on
him
slowly
he
giggled
uncontrollably
as
he
backed
away
from
her
you
you
more
torture
comin
to
ye
before
i
satisfied
that
you
can
keep
a
secret
he
held
his
arms
before
him
like
a
movie
zombie
and
walked
toward
her
yes
mathter
he
said
in
a
monotone
just
as
he
was
about
to
reach
her
he
dodged
to
one
side
then
took
off
she
chased
him
laughing
halfway
back
to
the
mountain
then
cried
off
he
stopped
a
hundred
yards
up
the
road
from
her
she
doubled
over
with
her
hands
planted
on
her
thighs
face
red
chest
heaving
you
go
on
then
she
called
but
it
more
torture
for
you
at
school
tomorrow
and
do
you
forget
it
only
if
you
catch
me
he
called
back
oh
i
catch
you
have
no
fear
she
caught
him
at
lunch
he
was
sitting
in
a
corner
of
the
schoolyard
eating
from
a
paper
sack
of
mushrooms
and
dried
rabbit
and
keeping
an
eye
on
as
he
played
tag
with
the
other
kindergartners
she
snuck
up
behind
him
and
dropped
a
handful
of
gravel
down
the
gap
of
his
pants
and
into
his
underpants
he
sprang
to
his
feet
sending
gravel
rattling
out
the
cuffs
of
his
jeans
hey
he
said
and
she
popped
something
into
his
mouth
it
was
wet
and
warm
from
her
hand
and
it
squirmed
he
spat
it
out
and
it
landed
on
the
schoolyard
with
a
soft
splat
it
was
an
earthworm
thick
with
loamy
soil
you
he
said
casting
about
for
a
curse
of
sufficient
vehemence
you
she
hopped
from
foot
to
foot
in
front
of
him
clearly
delighted
with
this
reaction
he
reached
out
for
her
and
she
danced
back
he
took
off
after
her
and
they
were
chasing
around
the
yard
around
hopscotches
and
tag
games
and
sand
castles
and
out
to
the
marshy
woods
she
skidded
through
the
puddles
and
he
leapt
over
them
she
ducked
under
a
branch
and
he
caught
her
by
the
hood
of
her
windbreaker
without
hesitating
she
flung
her
arms
in
the
air
and
slithered
out
of
the
windbreaker
down
to
a
yellow
that
rode
up
her
back
exposing
her
pale
freckles
and
the
knobs
of
her
spine
the
fingers
of
her
ribs
she
took
off
again
and
he
balled
the
windbreaker
up
in
his
fist
and
took
off
after
her
she
stepped
behind
a
bushy
pine
and
when
he
rounded
the
corner
she
was
waiting
for
him
her
hands
clawed
digging
at
his
tummy
leaving
him
giggling
he
pitched
back
into
the
pine
needles
and
she
followed
straddling
his
waist
and
tickling
him
until
he
coughed
and
choked
and
gasped
for
air
tell
me
she
said
tell
me
your
secrets
stop
alan
said
please
i
going
to
piss
myself
what
that
to
me
she
said
tickling
more
vigorously
he
tried
to
buck
her
off
but
she
was
too
fast
he
caught
one
wrist
but
she
pinned
his
other
arm
with
her
knee
he
heaved
and
she
collapsed
on
top
of
him
her
face
was
inches
from
his
her
breath
moist
on
his
face
they
both
panted
and
he
smelled
her
hair
which
was
over
his
face
and
neck
she
leaned
forward
and
closed
her
eyes
expectantly
he
tentatively
brushed
his
lips
across
hers
and
she
moved
closer
and
they
kissed
it
was
wet
and
a
little
gross
but
not
altogether
unpleasant
she
leaned
back
and
opened
her
eyes
then
grinned
at
him
that
enough
torture
for
one
day
she
said
you
free
to
go
she
tortured
him
at
morning
and
afternoon
recess
for
the
next
two
weeks
and
when
he
left
school
on
friday
afternoon
after
the
last
bell
she
was
waiting
for
him
in
the
schoolyard
hello
she
said
socking
him
in
the
arm
hi

said

way

his
head
horribly
deformed
he
shook
his
head

hint

she
grabbed
his
ear
and
twisted

said

gasped

a
secret

very
hard

tell
me
what
i
want
to
know
he
grabbed
her
wrist
and
dug
his
strong
fingers
into
the
thin
tendons
on
their
insides
twisting
his
fingertips
for
maximal
effect
abruptly
she
released
his
ear
and
clenched
her
wrist
hard
sticking
it
between
her
thighs
owwww
that
bloody
hurt
you
bastard
what
did
you

that
for

alan
said

she
held
her
wrist
up
and
examined
it
heaven

if
you
left
a
bruise
alvin
she
said

kill

she
turned
her
wrist
from
side
to
side
all
right
she
said
all
right
kiss
it
better
and
you
can
come
to
my
place
for
supper
on
saturday
at
six
she
shoved
her
arm
into
his
face
and
he
kissed
the
soft
skin
on
the
inside
of
her
wrist
putting
a
little
tongue
in
it
she
giggled
and
punched
him
in
the
arm
saturday
then
she
called
as
she
ran
off
were
too
young
to
give
him
shit
about
his
schoolyard
romance
and
brian
was
too
sensitive
but
dave
had
taken
to
lurking
about
the
schoolyard
spying
on
the
children
and
he
seen
marci
break
off
from
a
clench
with
alan
take
his
hand
and
plant
it
firmly
on
her
tiny
breast
an
act
that
had
shocked
danny
to
the
core
hi
pervert
david
said
as
he
stepped
into
the
cool
of
the
cave
pervert
was
davey
new
nickname
for
him
and
he
had
a
finely
honed
way
of
delivering
it
so
that
it
dripped
with
contempt
did
you
have
sex
with
your
today
allan
turned
away
from
him
and
helped
take
off
his
shoes
and
roll
up
the
cuffs
of
his
pants
so
that
he
could
go
down
to
the
lake
in
the
middle
of
their
father
and
wade
in
the
shallows
listening
to
winds
soughing
through
the
great
cavern
did
you
touch
her
boobies
did
she
suck
your
did
you
put
your
finger
in
her
the
litany
would
continue
until
davey
went
to
bed
and
even
then
he
was
safe
one
night
allen
had
woken
up
to
see
darren
standing
over
him
hands
planted
on
his
hips
face
twisted
into
an
elaborate
sneer
did
you
put
your
penis
inside
of
her
he
hissed
then
gone
back
to
bed
alby
went
out
again
climbing
the
rockface
faster
than
doug
could
keep
up
with
him
so
that
by
the
time
he
found
his
perch
high
over
the
woodlands
where
he
could
see
the
pines
dance
in
the
wind
and
the
cars
zooming
along
the
highways
doug
was
far
behind
likely
sat
atop
their
mother
sucking
his
thumb
and
sulking
and
thinking
up
new
perversions
to
accuse
alan
of
saturday
night
arrived
faster
than
alan
could
have
imagined
he
spent
saturday
morning
in
the
woods
picking
mushrooms
and
checking
his
snares
then
headed
down
to
town
on
saturday
afternoon
to
get
a
haircut
and
to
haunt
the
library
converting
his
father
gold
to
cash
was
easier
than
getting
a
library
card
without
an
address
there
was
an
old
assayer
whom
the
golems
had
described
to
him
before
his
first
trip
to
town
the
man
was
cheap
but
he
knew
enough
about
the
strangeness
on
the
mountain
not
to
cheat
him
too
badly
the
stern
librarian
who
glared
at
him
while
he
walked
the
shelves
sometimes
looking
at
the
titles
sometimes
the
authors
and
sometimes
the
dewey
decimal
numbers
had
no
such
fear
the
deweys
were
fascinating
they
traced
the
fashions
in
human
knowledge
and
wisdom
it
was
easy
enough
to
understand
why
the
arbiters
of
the
system
subdivided
motorized
land
vehicles
into
several
categories
but
here
in
the
where
the
books
on
automobiles
were
you
could
see
the
planners
deficiencies
automobiles
divided
into
dozens
of
major
subcategories
taxis
and
limousines
buses
light
trucks
cans
lorries
tractor
trailers
campers
motorcycles
racing
cars
and
so
on
then
ramified
into
a
combinatorial
explosion
of
categories
there
were
dewey
numbers
on
some
of
the
automotive
book
spines
that
had
twenty
digits
or
more
after
the
decimal
an
entire
dewey
decimal
system
hidden
between
and
to
the
librarian
this
looked
like
your
screwing
around
but
what
really
made
her
nervous
were
alan
excursions
through
the
card
catalogue
which
required
constant
tending
to
replace
the
cards
that
errant
patrons
made
unauthorized
reorderings
of
the
subject
headings
in
the
third
bank
of
card
drawers
were
the
most
interesting
of
all
they
too
branched
and
forked
and
rejoined
themselves
like
the
meanderings
of
an
ant
colony
on
the
march
he
go
in
sequence
for
a
while
then
start
following
when
he
found
an
interesting
branch
keeping
notes
on
scraps
of
paper
on
top
of
the
file
drawer
he
had
spent
quite
some
time
in
the
mythology
categories
looking
up
golems
and
goblins
looking
up
changelings
and
monsters
looking
up
seers
and
demigods
but
none
of
the
books
that
taken
down
off
the
shelves
had
contained
anything
that
helped
him
understand
his
family
better
his
family
was
uncatalogued
and
unclassified
in
human
knowledge
he
rang
the
bell
on
marci
smart
little
brick
house
at
six
carrying
some
daisies
he
bought
from
the
grocery
store
following
the
etiquette
laid
down
in
several
rather
yucky
romance
novels
he
perused
that
afternoon
she
answered
in
jeans
and
a
and
punched
him
in
the
arm
before
he
could
give
her
the
flowers
do
you
look
smart
she
said
well
you
not
fooling
anyone
you
know
she
gave
him
a
peck
on
the
cheek
and
snatched
away
the
daisies
come
along
then
we
eating
soon
marci
sat
him
down
in
the
living
room
which
was
furnished
with
neutral
sofas
and
a
neutral
carpet
and
a
neutral
coffee
table
the
bookcases
were
bare
it
horrible
she
said
making
a
face
she
was
twittering
a
little
dancing
from
foot
to
foot
alan
was
glad
to
know
he
was
the
only
one
who
was
uncomfortable
is
it
the
company
put
us
up
here
we
had
a
grand
flat
in
scotland
it
nice
alan
said
but
you
look
like
you
could
use
some
books
she
crossed
her
eyes
books
sure
i
got
of
them
in
the
basement
you
can
come
by
and
help
me
unpack
them
ten
alan
said
you
making
that
up
boxes
of
books
things
like
books
did
last
long
under
the
mountain
in
the
damp
and
with
the
davey
exploring
every
inch
of
floor
and
cave
and
corridor
in
search
of
opportunities
for
pillage
i
ai
neither
she
said
at
least
ten
it
was
a
grand
flat
and
they
were
all
in
alphabetical
order
too
can
we
go
see
alan
asked
getting
up
from
the
sofa
see
boxes
yes
alan
said
and
look
inside
we
could
unbox
them
after
dinner
okay
that
more
of
an
afternoon
project
said
a
voice
from
the
top
of
the
stairs
that
my
da
she
said
come
down
and
introduce
yourself
to
alan
da
she
said
you
not
the
voice
of
god
so
you
can
bloody
well
turn
up
and
show
your
face
no
more
sass
gel
or
it
will
go
very
hard
for
you
said
the
voice
the
accent
was
like
marci
squared
thick
as
oatmeal
nearly
incomprehensible
but
the
voice
was
kind
and
smart
and
patient
too
you
have
a
hard
time
giving
me
any
licks
from
the
top
of
the
stairs
da
and
alan
looks
like
he
going
to
die
if
you
do
at
least
come
down
and
say
hello
alan
blushed
furiously
you
can
come
down
whenever
you
like
sir
he
said
that
all
right
that
mighty
generous
of
you
young
sir
said
the
voice
aye
but
before
i
come
down
tell
me
are
your
intentions
toward
my
daughter
honorable
his
cheeks
grew
even
hotter
and
his
ears
felt
like
they
were
melting
with
embarrassment
yes
sir
he
said
in
a
small
voice
he
a
dreadful
pervert
da
marci
said
you
should
see
the
things
he
tries
you
kill
him
you
would
she
grinned
foxish
and
punched
him
in
the
shoulder
he
sank
into
the
cushions
face
suddenly
drained
of
blood
roared
the
voice
and
there
was
a
clatter
of
slippers
on
the
neutral
carpet
of
the
stairs
alan
did
want
to
look
but
found
that
he
could
help
himself
his
head
inexorably
turned
toward
the
sound
until
a
pair
of
thick
legs
hove
into
sight
whereupon
marci
leapt
into
his
lap
and
threw
her
arms
around
his
neck
me
pervert
she
said
as
she
began
to
cover
his
face
in
darting
pecking
kisses
he
went
rigid
and
tried
to
sink
all
the
way
into
the
sofa
all
right
all
right
that
enough
of
that
her
father
said
marci
stood
and
dusted
herself
off
alan
stared
at
his
knees
she
horrible
is
she
said
the
voice
and
a
great
thick
hand
appeared
in
his
field
of
vision
he
shook
it
tentatively
noting
the
heavy
class
ring
and
the
thin
plain
wedding
band
he
looked
up
slowly
marci
father
was
short
but
powerfully
built
like
the
wrestlers
on
the
other
kids
lunchboxes
at
school
he
had
a
shock
of
curly
black
hair
that
was
flecked
with
dandruff
and
a
thick
bristling
mustache
that
made
him
look
very
fierce
though
his
eyes
were
gentle
and
bookish
behind
thick
glasses
he
was
wearing
wool
trousers
and
a
sweater
that
was
unraveling
at
the
elbows
pleased
to
meet
you
albert
he
said
they
shook
hands
gravely
been
after
her
to
unpack
those
books
since
we
moved
here
you
could
come
by
tomorrow
afternoon
and
help
if
you
like
i
think
it
the
only
way
i
get
herself
to
stir
her
lazy
bottom
to
do
some
chores
around
here
oh
marci
said
who
cooks
around
here
who
does
the
laundry
the
pizza
man
does
the
majority
of
the
cooking
daughter
and
as
for
laundry
the
last
time
i
checked
there
were
two
weeks
worth
of
laundry
to
do
da
she
said
in
a
sweet
voice
i
love
you
da
she
said
wrapping
her
arms
around
his
trim
waist
you
see
what
i
have
to
put
up
with
her
father
said
snatching
her
up
and
dangling
her
by
her
ankles
she
flailed
her
arms
about
and
made
outraged
choking
noises
while
he
swung
her
back
and
forth
like
a
pendulum
releasing
her
at
the
top
of
one
arc
so
that
she
flopped
onto
the
sofa
in
a
tangle
of
thin
limbs
it
a
madhouse
around
here
her
father
continued
as
marci
righted
herself
knocking
alan
in
the
temple
with
a
tennis
shoe
but
what
can
you
do
once
she
a
little
bigger
i
can
put
her
to
work
in
the
mines
and
then
i
have
a
little
peace
around
here
he
sat
down
on
an
overstuffed
armchair
with
a
fussy
antimacassar
he
got
a
huge
policy
marci
said
conspiratorially
i
just
waiting
for
him
to
kick
the
bucket
and
then
i
going
to
retire
oh
aye
her
father
said
retire
your
life
is
an
awful
one
it
is
junior
high
is
a
terrible
hardship
i
know
alan
found
himself
grinning
what
so
funny
marci
said
punching
him
in
the
shoulder
you
two
are
he
said
grabbing
her
arm
and
then
digging
his
fingers
into
her
tummy
doubling
her
over
with
tickles
there
were
boxes
of
books
the
damp
in
the
basement
had
softened
the
cartons
to
mush
and
the
back
covers
of
the
bottom
layer
of
paperbacks
were
soft
as
felt
to
alan
these
seemed
unremarkable
all
paper
under
the
mountain
looked
like
this
after
a
week
or
two
even
if
doug
did
get
to
it
but
marci
was
heartbroken
my
books
my
lovely
books
they
roont
she
said
as
they
piled
them
on
the
living
room
carpet
they
fine
alan
said
they
dry
out
a
little
wobbly
but
be
fine
we
just
spread
the
damp
ones
out
on
the
rug
and
shelve
the
rest
and
that
what
they
did
book
after
book
old
books
hardcover
books
kids
books
new
paperbacks
dozens
of
and
penguin
paperbacks
he
fondled
them
smelled
them
some
smelled
of
fish
and
chips
and
some
smelled
of
road
dust
and
some
smelled
of
marci
and
they
had
dog
ears
where
she
stopped
and
cracks
in
their
spines
where
she
bent
them
around
they
fell
open
to
pages
that
had
her
favorite
passages
he
felt
wobbly
and
drunk
as
he
touched
each
one
in
turn
have
you
read
all
of
these
alan
asked
as
he
shifted
the
john
mortimers
down
one
shelf
to
make
room
for
the
ed
mcbains
naw
she
said
punching
him
in
the
shoulder
what
the
point
of
a
bunch
of
books
you
already
read
she
caught
him
in
the
schoolyard
on
monday
and
dragged
him
by
one
ear
out
to
the
marshy
part
she
pinned
him
down
and
straddled
his
chest
and
tickled
him
with
one
hand
so
that
he
cried
out
and
used
the
other
hand
to
drum
a
finger
across
his
lips
so
that
his
cries
came
out
bibble
once
he
bucked
her
off
they
kissed
for
a
little
while
then
she
grabbed
hold
of
one
of
his
nipples
and
twisted
all
right
she
said
enough
torture
when
do
i
get
to
meet
your
family
you
ca
he
said
writhing
on
the
pine
needles
which
worked
their
way
up
the
back
of
his
shirt
and
pricked
him
across
his
lower
back
feeling
like
the
bristles
of
a
hairbrush
oh
i
can
and
i
will
she
said
she
twisted
harder
he
slapped
her
hand
away
my
family
is
really
weird
he
said
my
parents
do
really
ever
go
out
they
not
like
other
people
they
do
talk
all
of
it
true
they
mute
no
but
they
do
talk
they
do
talk
much
or
they
do
talk
at
all
she
pronounced
it
not
at
all
how
did
you
and
your
brothers
learn
to
talk
then
neighbors
still
true
the
golems
lived
in
the
neighboring
caves
and
my
father
a
little
true
so
you
have
neighbors
who
visit
you
she
asked
a
triumphant
gleam
in
her
eye
no
we
visit
them
lying
now
sweat
on
the
shag
of
hair
over
his
ears
which
felt
like
they
had
coals
pressed
to
them
when
you
were
a
baby
no
my
grandparents
took
care
of
me
when
i
was
a
baby
deeper
but
they
died
bottoming
out
now
i
do
believe
you
she
said
and
he
saw
tears
glisten
in
her
eyes
you
too
embarrassed
to
introduce
me
to
your
family
that
not
it
he
thought
fast
my
brother
david
he
not
well
he
has
a
brain
tumor
we
think
he
probably
die
that
why
he
come
to
school
and
it
makes
him
act
funny
he
hits
people
says
terrible
things
mixing
truth
with
lies
was
a
easier
he
shouts
and
hurts
people
and
he
the
reason
i
ca
ever
have
friends
over
not
until
he
dies
her
eyes
narrowed
if
that
a
lie
she
said
it
a
terrible
one
my
ma
died
of
cancer
and
it
not
something
anyone
should
make
fun
of
so
it
better
not
be
a
lie
it
not
a
lie
he
said
mustering
a
tear
my
brother
david
we
know
how
long
he
live
but
it
wo
be
long
he
acts
like
a
monster
so
it
hard
to
love
him
but
we
all
try
she
rocked
back
onto
her
haunches
it
true
then
she
asked
softly
he
nodded
miserably
let
say
no
more
about
it
then
she
said
she
took
his
hand
and
traced
hieroglyphs
on
his
palm
with
the
ragged
edges
of
her
fingernails
the
recess
bell
rang
and
they
headed
back
to
school
they
were
about
to
leave
the
marshland
when
something
hard
hit
alan
in
the
back
of
the
head
he
spun
around
and
saw
a
small
sharp
rock
skitter
into
the
grass
saw
davey
face
contorted
with
rage
lips
pulled
all
the
way
back
off
his
teeth
in
the
boughs
of
a
tree
winding
up
to
throw
another
rock
he
flinched
away
and
the
rock
hit
the
paving
hard
enough
to
bounce
marci
whirled
around
but
david
was
gone
high
up
in
the
leaves
invisible
malicious
biding
what
was
that
i
dunno
alan
lied
and
groaned
kurt
and
alan
examined
every
gap
between
every
storefront
on
augusta
no
matter
how
narrow
kurt
kept
silent
as
alan
fished
his
arm
up
to
the
shoulder
along
miniature
alleys
that
were
just
wide
enough
to
accommodate
the
rain
gutters
depending
from
the
roof
they
found
the
alley
that
frederick
had
been
dragged
down
near
the
end
of
the
block
between
a
mattress
store
and
an
egg
wholesaler
it
was
narrow
enough
that
they
had
to
traverse
it
sideways
but
there
at
the
entrance
were
two
smears
of
skin
and
blood
just
above
the
ground
stretching
off
into
the
sulfurous
depths
of
the
alleyway
they
slid
along
the
alley
length
headed
for
the
gloom
of
the
back
something
skittered
away
from
alan
shoe
and
he
bent
down
but
could
see
it
he
ran
his
hands
along
the
ground
and
the
walls
and
they
came
back
with
a
rime
of
dried
blood
and
a
single
strand
of
long
oily
hair
stuck
to
them
he
wiped
his
palms
off
on
the
bricks
i
ca
see
he
said
here
kurt
said
handing
him
a
miniature
maglight
whose
handle
was
corrugated
by
hundreds
of
toothmarks
alan
saw
that
he
was
intense
watching
alan
twisted
the
light
on
thanks
he
said
and
kurt
smiled
at
him
seemed
a
little
taller
alan
looked
again
there
on
the
ground
was
a
sharpened
black
tooth
pierced
by
a
piece
of
wire
he
pocketed
the
tooth
before
kurt
saw
it
and
delved
farther
approaching
the
alley
end
which
was
carpeted
with
a
humus
of
moldering
cardboard
leaves
and
road
turds
blown
or
washed
there
he
kicked
it
aside
as
best
he
could
then
crouched
down
to
examine
the
sewer
grating
beneath
the
greenish
brass
screws
that
anchored
it
to
the
ground
had
sharp
cuts
in
their
old
grooves
where
they
had
been
recently
removed
he
rattled
the
grating
which
was
about
half
a
meter
square
then
slipped
his
multitool
out
of
his
belt
holster
he
flipped
out
the
phillips
driver
and
went
to
work
on
the
screws
unconsciously
putting
kurt
flashlight
in
his
mouth
his
front
teeth
finding
purchase
in
the
dents
that
kurt
own
had
left
there
he
realized
with
a
brief
shudder
that
kurt
probably
used
this
flashlight
while
in
dumpsters
had
an
image
of
kurt
transferring
it
from
his
gloved
hands
to
his
mouth
and
back
again
as
he
dug
through
bags
of
kitchen
and
toilet
waste
looking
for
discarded
technology
but
the
metal
was
cool
and
clean
against
his
teeth
and
so
he
bit
down
and
worked
the
four
screws
loose
worked
his
fingers
into
the
mossy
slots
in
the
grate
lifted
it
out
and
set
it
to
one
side
he
shone
the
light
down
the
hole
and
found
another
fingerbone
the
tip
of
a
thumb
desiccated
to
the
size
of
a
large
raisin
and
he
pocketed
that
too
there
was
a
lot
of
blood
here
a
little
puddle
that
was
still
wet
in
the
crusted
middle
frederick
blood
he
stepped
over
the
grating
and
shone
the
light
back
down
the
hole
inviting
kurt
to
have
a
look
that
where
they
went
he
said
as
kurt
bent
down
that
hole
that
hole
he
said
is
that
blood
that
blood
it
not
easy
to
fit
someone
my
brother
size
down
a
hole
like
that
he
set
the
grate
back
screwed
it
into
place
and
passed
the
torch
back
to
kurt
let
get
out
of
here
he
said
on
the
street
alan
looked
at
his
blood
and
palms
kurt
pushed
back
his
floppy
mohawk
and
scratched
vigorously
at
the
downy
brown
fuzz
growing
in
on
the
sides
of
his
skull
you
think
i
a
nut
alan
said
it
okay
that
natural
kurt
smiled
sheepishly
if
it
any
consolation
i
think
you
a
nut
okay
i
like
you
you
do
have
to
believe
me
so
long
as
you
do
get
in
my
way
alan
said
but
it
easier
if
you
believe
me
easier
to
do
what
oh
to
get
along
alan
said
davey
leapt
down
from
a
rock
outcropping
as
alan
made
his
way
home
that
night
landing
on
his
back
alan
stumbled
and
dropped
his
school
bag
he
grabbed
at
the
choking
arm
around
his
neck
then
dropped
to
his
knees
as
davey
bounced
a
stone
off
his
head
right
over
his
ear
he
slammed
himself
back
pinning
davey
between
himself
and
the
sharp
stones
on
the
walkway
up
to
the
cave
entrance
then
mashed
backward
with
his
elbows
his
head
ringing
like
a
gong
from
the
stone
blow
his
left
elbow
connected
with
davey
solar
plexus
and
the
arm
around
his
throat
went
slack
he
climbed
to
his
knees
and
looked
davey
in
the
face
he
was
blue
and
gasping
but
alan
could
work
up
a
lot
of
sympathy
for
him
as
he
reached
up
to
the
side
of
his
head
and
felt
the
goose
egg
welling
there
his
fingertips
came
back
with
a
few
strands
of
hair
to
them
he
been
in
a
few
schoolyard
scraps
and
this
was
always
the
moment
when
a
teacher
intervened
one
combatant
pinned
the
other
atop
him
what
could
you
do
after
this
was
he
going
to
take
the
rock
from
davey
hand
and
smash
him
in
the
face
with
it
knocking
out
his
teeth
breaking
his
nose
blacking
his
eyes
could
he
get
off
of
davey
without
getting
back
into
the
fight
he
pinned
davey
shoulders
under
his
knees
and
took
him
by
the
chin
with
one
hand
you
ca
do
this
danny
he
said
looking
into
his
hazel
eyes
which
had
gone
green
as
they
did
when
he
was
angry
do
spy
on
me
try
to
hurt

to
hurt

friends

time

you
in
your
sleep
andy
i
break
your
fingers
with
a
brick
i
poke
your
eyes
out
with
a
fork
he
was
fizzling
like
a
volcano
saliva
slicking
his
cheeks
and
nostrils
and
chin
his
eyes
rolling
alan
felt
helplessness
settle
on
him
weighing
down
his
limbs
how
could
he
let
him
go
what
else
could
he
do
was
he
going
to
have
to
sit
on
davey
shoulders
until
they
were
both
old
men

danny
please

okay
darren
bared
his
teeth
and
growled
jerking
his
head
forward
and
snapping
at
alan
crotch
heedless
of
the
painful
thuds
his
head
made
when
it
hit
the
ground
after
each
lunge
alan
waited
to
see
if
he
would
tire
himself
out
but
when
it
was
clear
that
he
would
not
tire
alan
waited
for
his
head
to
thud
to
the
ground
and
then
abruptly
he
popped
him
in
the
chin
leapt
off
of
him
turned
him
on
his
belly
and
wrenched
him
to
his
knees
twisting
one
arm
behind
his
back
and
pulling
his
head
back
by
the
hair
he
brought
davey
to
his
feet
under
his
control
before
he
recovered
from
the
punch
i
telling
dad
he
said
in
davey
ear
and
began
to
him
through
to
the
cave
mouth
and
down
into
the
lake
in
the
middle
of
the
mountain
he
did
even
slow
down
when
they
reached
the
smooth
shore
of
the
lake
just
pushed
on
sloshing
in
up
to
his
chest
davey
head
barely
above
the
water
he
wo
stop
alan
said
to
the
winds
to
the
water
to
the
vaulted
ceiling
to
the
scurrying
retreat
of
the
goblin
i
think
he
kill
me
if
he
goes
on
he
torturing
me
you
seen
it
look
at
him
davey
was
thrashing
in
the
water
his
face
swollen
and
bloody
his
eyes
rattling
like
dried
peas
in
a
maraca
alan
fingers
still
buried
in
davey
shiny
blond
hair
kept
brushing
up
against
the
swollen
bruises
there
getting
bigger
by
the
moment
i
kill
you
davey
howled
screaming
inchoate
into
the
echo
that
came
back
from
his
call
shhh
alan
said
into
his
ear
shhh
listen
davey
please
shhh
davey
roar
did
not
abate
alan
thought
he
could
hear
the
whispers
and
groans
of
their
father
in
the
wind
but
he
could
make
it
out
please
shhh
he
said
gathering
davey
in
a
hug
that
pinned
his
arms
to
his
sides
putting
his
lips
up
against
davey
ear
holding
him
still
shhh
he
said
and
davey
stopped
twitching
against
him
stopped
his
terrible
roar
and
they
listened
at
first
the
sound
was
barely
audible
a
soughing
through
the
tunnels
but
gradually
the
echoes
chased
each
other
round
the
great
cavern
and
across
the
still
dark
surface
of
the
lake
and
then
a
voice
illusive
as
a
face
in
the
clouds
my
boys
the
voice
said
their
father
said
my
sons
david
alan
you
must
not
fight
like
this
he
davey
began
the
echoes
of
his
outburst
scattering
their
father
voice
shhh
alan
said
again
daniel
you
must
love
your
brother
he
loves
you
i
love
you
trust
him
he
wo
hurt
you
i
wo
let
you
come
to
any
harm
i
love
you
son
alan
felt
danny
tremble
in
his
arms
and
he
was
trembling
too
from
the
icy
cold
of
the
lake
and
from
the
voice
and
the
words
and
the
love
that
echoed
from
every
surface
adam
my
son
keep
your
brother
safe
you
need
each
other
do
be
impatient
or
angry
with
him
give
him
love
i
will
alan
said
and
he
relaxed
his
arms
so
that
he
was
holding
danny
in
a
hug
and
not
a
pinion
danny
relaxed
back
into
him
i
love
you
dad
he
said
and
they
trudged
out
of
the
water
out
into
the
last
warmth
of
the
day
sun
to
dry
out
on
the
slope
of
the
mountainside
green
grass
under
their
bodies
and
wispy
clouds
in
the
sky
that
they
watched
until
the
sun
went
out
marci
followed
him
home
a
week
before
christmas
break
he
did
notice
her
at
first
she
was
cunning
and
followed
his
boot
prints
in
the
snow
a
blizzard
had
blown
up
halfway
through
the
school
day
and
by
the
time
class
let
out
there
was
fresh
powder
and
he
had
to
lift
each
foot
high
to
hike
through
it
the
shush
of
his
snow
pants
and
the
huff
of
his
breath
the
only
sounds
in
the
icy
winter
evening
she
followed
the
deep
prints
of
his
boots
on
the
fresh
snow
stalking
him
like
he
stalked
rabbits
in
the
woods
when
he
happened
to
turn
around
at
the
cave
mouth
he
spotted
her
in
her
yellow
struggling
up
the
mountainside
barely
visible
in
the
twilight
he
never
seen
an
intruder
on
the
mountain
the
dirt
trail
that
led
up
to
the
cave
branched
off
a
side
road
on
the
edge
of
town
and
it
was
too
rocky
even
for
the
kids
he
stood
at
the
torn
by
indecision
he
wanted
to
keep
walking
head
away
farther
uphill
away
from
the
family
den
but
now
she
seen
him
had
waved
to
him
his
face
drained
of
blood
and
his
bladder
hammered
insistently
at
him
he
hiked
down
the
mountain
and
met
her
why
are
you
here
he
said
once
he
was
close
enough
to
see
her
pale
freckled
face
why
do
you
think
she
said
i
followed
you
home
where
do
you
live
alan
why
ca
i
even
see
where
you
live
he
felt
tears
prick
at
his
eyes
you
just
i
ca
bring
you
home
you
hate
me
do
you
she
said
hands
balling
up
into
mittened
fists
that
it
i
do
hate
you
marci
i
i
love
you
he
said
surprising
himself
she
punched
him
hard
in
the
arm
shut
up
she
kissed
his
cheek
with
her
cold
dry
lips
and
the
huff
of
her
breath
thawed
his
skin
making
it
tingle
where
do
you
live
alan
he
sucked
air
so
cold
it
burned
his
lungs
come
with
me
he
took
her
mittened
hand
in
his
and
trudged
up
to
the
cave
mouth
they
entered
the
summer
cave
where
the
family
spent
its
time
in
the
warm
months
now
mostly
empty
save
for
some
straw
and
a
few
scattered
bits
of
clothing
and
toys
he
led
her
through
the
cave
his
eyes
adjusting
to
the
gloom
back
to
the
bend
behind
a
stalactite
baffle
toward
the
sulfur
reek
of
the
hot
spring
on
whose
shores
the
family
spent
its
winters
it
gets
dark
he
said
i
get
you
a
light
once
we
inside
her
hand
squeezed
his
tighter
and
she
said
nothing
it
grew
darker
and
darker
as
he
pushed
into
the
cave
helping
her
up
the
gentle
incline
of
the
cave
floor
he
saw
well
in
the
dark
the
whole
family
did
but
he
understood
that
for
her
this
was
a
blind
voyage
they
stepped
out
into
the
cavern
the
acoustics
of
their
breathing
changed
by
the
long
flat
hollow
in
the
dark
he
saw
playing
with
his
matchbox
cars
in
one
corner
davey
leaned
up
against
their
mother
sucking
his
thumb
billy
was
nowhere
in
sight
probably
hiding
out
in
his
room
he
would
of
course
have
foreseen
this
visit
he
put
her
hand
against
the
cave
wall
then
said
wait
here
he
let
go
of
her
and
walked
quickly
to
the
heap
of
winter
coats
and
boots
in
the
corner
and
dug
through
them
for
the
flashlight
he
used
to
do
his
homework
by
it
was
a
number
and
as
he
squeezed
it
to
life
he
pointed
it
at
marci
her
face
wan
and
scared
in
its
light
he
gave
the
flashlight
a
few
more
pumps
to
get
its
flywheel
spinning
then
passed
it
to
her
just
keep
squeezing
it
he
said
it
does
need
batteries
he
took
her
hand
again
it
was
limp
you
can
put
your
things
on
the
pile
he
said
pointing
to
the
coats
and
boots
he
was
already
shucking
his
hat
and
mittens
and
boots
and
snow
pants
and
coat
his
skin
flushed
with
the
warm
vapors
coming
off
of
the
sulfur
spring
you
here
she
said
the
light
from
the
flashlight
was
dimming
and
he
reached
over
and
gave
it
a
couple
of
squeezes
then
handed
it
back
to
her
i
live
here
it
complicated
davey
eyes
were
open
and
he
was
staring
at
them
with
squinted
eyes
and
a
frown
where
are
your
parents
she
said
it
complicated
he
said
again
as
though
that
explained
everything
this
is
my
secret
no
one
else
knows
it
tottered
over
to
them
with
an
armload
of
toy
cars
which
he
mutely
offered
to
marci
smiling
a
drooly
smile
alan
patted
him
on
the
head
and
knelt
down
i
do
think
marci
wants
to
play
cars
okay
ed
nodded
solemnly
and
went
back
to
the
edge
of
the
pool
and
began
running
his
cars
through
the
nearly
scalding
water
marci
reached
out
a
hand
ahead
of
her
into
the
weak
light
looked
at
the
crazy
shadows
it
cast
on
the
distant
walls
how
can
you
live
here
a
cave
alan
how
can
you
live
in
a
cave
you
get
used
to
it
alan
said
i
ca
explain
it
all
and
the
parts
that
i
can
explain
you
would
believe
but
you
been
to
my
home
now
marci
i
shown
you
where
i
live
davey
approached
them
a
beatific
smile
on
his
angelic
face
this
is
my
brother
daniel
alan
said
the
one
i
told
you
about
you
his
slut
davey
said
he
was
still
smiling
do
you
touch
his
peter
alan
flinched
suppressing
a
desire
to
smack
davey
but
marci
just
knelt
down
and
looked
him
in
the
eye
nope
she
said
are
you
always
this
horrible
to
strangers
yes
davey
said
cheerfully
i
hate
you
and
i
hate
he
cocked
his
head
alanward
and
you
all
but
we
not
wee
horrible
shits
danny
she
said
we
not
brats
who
ca
keep
a
civil
tongue
davey
snapped
his
head
back
and
then
forward
trying
to
get
her
in
the
bridge
of
the
nose
a
favorite
tactic
of
his
but
she
was
too
fast
for
him
and
ducked
it
so
that
he
stumbled
and
fell
to
his
knees
your
mother
going
to
be
very
cross
when
she
finds
out
how
you
been
acting
you
be
lucky
if
you
get
any
christmas
pressies
she
said
as
he
struggled
to
his
feet
he
swung
a
punch
at
her
groin
and
she
caught
his
wrist
and
then
hoisted
him
to
his
tiptoes
by
his
arm
then
lifted
him
off
the
floor
bringing
his
face
up
level
with
hers
stop
it
she
said
he
fell
silent
and
narrowed
his
eyes
as
he
dangled
there
thinking
about
this
then
he
spat
in
her
face
marci
shook
her
head
slowly
as
the
gob
of
spit
slid
down
her
eyebrow
and
over
her
cheek
then
she
spat
back
nailing
him
square
on
the
tip
of
his
nose
she
set
him
down
and
wiped
her
face
with
a
glove
davey
started
toward
her
and
she
lifted
a
hand
and
he
flinched
back
and
then
ran
behind
their
mother
hiding
in
her
tangle
of
wires
and
hoses
marci
gave
the
flashlight
a
series
of
hard
cranks
that
splashed
light
across
the
washing
machine
and
then
turned
to
alan
that
your
brother
alan
nodded
well
i
see
why
you
did
want
me
to
come
home
with
you
then
kurt
was
properly
appreciative
of
alan
bookcases
and
trophies
ran
his
fingertips
over
the
wood
willingly
accepted
some
iced
mint
tea
sweetened
with
honey
and
used
a
coaster
without
having
to
be
asked
a
washing
machine
and
a
mountain
he
said
yes
alan
said
he
kept
a
roof
over
our
heads
and
she
kept
our
clothes
clean
you
told
that
joke
before
right
kurt
foot
was
bouncing
which
made
the
chains
on
his
pants
and
jacket
jangle
and
now
davey
after
us
alan
said
i
do
know
why
it
now
i
do
know
why
davey
does
but
he
always
hated
me
most
of
all
so
why
did
he
snatch
your
brothers
first
i
think
he
wants
me
to
sweat
he
wants
me
scared
all
the
time
i
the
eldest
i
the
one
who
left
the
mountain
i
the
one
who
came
first
and
made
all
the
connections
with
the
outside
world
they
all
looked
to
me
to
explain
the
world
but
i
never
had
any
explanations
that
would
suit
davey
this
is
pretty
weird
he
said
alan
cocked
his
head
at
kurt
he
was
about
thirty
old
for
a
punk
and
had
a
kind
of
greasy
sheen
about
him
like
he
did
remember
to
wash
often
enough
despite
his
protestations
about
his
cleanliness
but
at
thirty
he
should
have
seen
enough
to
let
him
know
that
the
world
was
both
weirder
than
he
suspected
and
not
so
weird
as
certain
mystically
inclined
people
would
like
to
believe
arnold
did
like
this
moment
of
disclosure
did
like
dropping
his
carefully
cultivated
habit
of
hiding
this
but
he
also
could
help
but
feel
relieved
a
part
of
his
mind
nagged
him
though
and
told
him
that
too
much
of
this
would
waken
the
worry
for
his
brothers
from
its
narcotized
slumber
i
told
other
people
just
a
few
they
did
believe
me
you
have
to
why
do
you
think
about
it
for
a
while
what
are
you
going
to
do
i
going
to
try
to
figure
out
how
to
find
my
brothers
i
ca
go
underground
like
davey
can
i
do
think
i
can
anyway
i
never
have
but
davey
so
so
small
and
twisted
he
not
smart
but
he
cunning
and
he
determined
i
smarter
than
he
is
so
i
try
to
find
the
smart
way
i
think
about
it
too
well
i
got
to
get
ready
to
go
diving
kurt
said
he
stood
up
with
a
jangle
thanks
for
the
iced
tea
adam
it
was
nice
to
meet
you
kurt
alan
said
and
shook
his
hand
alan
woke
with
something
soft
over
his
face
it
was
pitch
dark
and
he
could
breathe
he
tried
to
reach
up
but
his
arms
would
move
he
could
sit
up
something
heavy
was
sitting
on
his
chest
the
soft
thing
a
pillow
ground
against
his
face
cruelly
pressing
down
on
the
cartilage
in
his
nose
filling
his
mouth
as
he
gasped
for
air
he
shuddered
hard
and
felt
something
give
near
his
right
wrist
and
then
his
arm
was
loose
from
the
elbow
down
he
kept
working
the
arm
his
chest
afire
and
then
he
freed
it
to
the
shoulder
and
something
bit
him
hard
little
teeth
like
knives
in
the
fleshy
underside
of
his
bicep
flailing
dug
the
teeth
in
harder
and
he
knew
he
was
bleeding
could
feel
it
seeping
down
his
arm
finally
he
got
his
hand
onto
something
a
desiccated
mummified
piece
of
flesh
davey
davey
ribs
like
dry
stones
cold
and
thin
he
felt
up
higher
felt
for
the
place
where
davey
arm
met
his
shoulder
and
then
twisted
as
hard
as
he
could
until
the
arm
popped
free
in
its
socket
he
shook
his
head
violently
and
the
pillow
slid
away
the
room
was
still
dark
and
the
hot
moist
air
rushed
into
his
nostrils
and
mouth
as
he
gasped
it
in
he
heard
davey
moving
in
the
dark
and
as
his
eyes
adjusted
he
saw
him
unfolding
a
knife
it
was
a
clasp
knife
with
a
broken
hasp
and
it
swung
open
with
the
sound
of
a
shell
crunching
underfoot
the
blade
was
rusty
alan
flung
his
freed
arm
across
his
body
and
tried
to
tug
himself
loose
he
was
being
held
down
by
his
own
sheets
which
had
been
tacked
or
stapled
to
the
bed
frame
using
all
his
strength
he
rolled
over
heaving
and
bucking
and
the
staples
popping
free
down
one
side
of
the
bed
just
as
davey
slashed
at
where
his
face
had
been
a
moment
before
the
knife
whistled
past
his
ear
then
scored
deeply
along
his
shoulder
his
arm
flopped
uselessly
at
his
side
and
now
they
were
both
fighting
though
davey
had
a
knife
and
adam
was
wrapped
in
a
sheet
his
bedroom
was
singularly
lacking
in
anything
that
could
be
improvised
into
a
weapon
he
considered
trying
getting
a
heavy
encyclopedia
out
to
use
as
a
shield
but
it
was
too
far
a
distance
and
too
long
a
shot
he
scooted
back
on
the
bed
trying
to
untangle
the
sheet
which
was
still
secured
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
all
along
one
side
he
freed
his
good
arm
just
as
davey
slashed
at
him
again
aiming
for
the
meat
of
his
thigh
the
big
arteries
there
that
could
bleed
you
out
in
a
minute
or
two
he
grabbed
for
davey
shoulder
and
caught
it
for
an
instant
squeezed
and
twisted
but
then
the
skin
he
had
hold
of
sloughed
away
and
davey
was
free
dancing
back
then
he
heard
from
downstairs
the
sound
of
rhythmic
pounding
at
the
door
he
been
hearing
it
for
some
time
but
had
registered
it
until
now
a
muffled
yell
from
below
police
mimi
he
screamed
out
help
hoping
his
voice
would
carry
through
the
door
apparently
it
did
he
heard
the
sound
of
the
small
glass
pane
over
the
doorknob
shatter
and
davey
turned
his
head
to
look
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
alan
snatched
up
the
pillow
that
he
been
smothering
under
and
swung
it
as
hard
as
he
could
at
davey
head
knocking
him
around
and
the
door
was
open
now
the
summer
night
air
sweeping
up
the
stairs
to
the
bedroom
alan
it
was
kurt
kurt
up
here
he
got
a
knife
boots
on
the
stairs
and
davey
standing
again
cornered
with
the
knife
slashing
at
the
air
toward
him
and
toward
the
bedroom
door
toward
the
light
coming
up
the
stairs
bobbing
kurt
maglight
clenched
in
his
teeth
and
davey
bolted
for
the
door
with
the
knife
held
high
the
light
stopped
moving
and
there
was
an
instant
tableau
davey
caught
in
the
light
cracked
black
lips
peeled
back
from
sharp
teeth
chest
heaving
knife
bobbing
and
then
alan
was
free
diving
for
his
knees
bringing
him
down
kurt
was
on
them
before
davey
could
struggle
up
to
his
good
elbow
kicking
the
knife
away
scattering
fingerbones
like
dice
davey
screeched
like
a
rusty
hinge
as
kurt
twisted
his
arms
up
behind
his
back
and
alan
took
hold
of
his
ankles
he
thrashed
like
a
raccoon
in
a
trap
and
alan
forced
the
back
of
his
head
down
so
that
his
face
was
mashed
against
the
cool
floor
muffling
his
cries
kurt
shifted
so
that
his
knee
and
one
hand
were
pinning
davey
wrists
fished
in
his
pockets
and
came
out
with
a
bundle
of
hairy
twine
he
set
it
on
the
floor
next
to
alan
and
then
shifted
his
grip
back
to
arms
as
soon
as
alan
released
the
back
of
davey
head
he
jerked
it
up
and
snapped
his
teeth
into
the
top
of
kurt
calf
just
above
the
top
of
his
high
boot
kurt
hollered
and
adam
reached
out
and
took
the
knife
moving
quickly
before
he
could
think
and
smashed
the
butt
into
davey
jaw
which
cracked
audibly
davey
let
go
of
kurt
calf
and
alan
worked
quickly
to
lash
his
feet
together
using
half
the
bundle
of
twine
heedless
of
how
he
cut
into
the
thin
cracking
skin
he
used
the
knife
to
snip
the
string
and
then
handed
the
roll
to
kurt
who
went
to
work
on
danny
wrists
alan
got
the
lights
and
rolled
his
brother
over
looked
into
his
mad
eyes
dale
was
trying
to
scream
but
with
his
jaw
hanging
limp
and
his
teeth
scattered
it
came
out
in
a
rasp
alan
stood
and
found
that
he
was
naked
his
shoulder
and
bicep
dripping
blood
down
his
side
into
a
pool
on
the
polished
floor
we
take
him
to
the
basement
he
told
kurt
and
dug
through
the
laundry
hamper
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
for
jeans
he
found
a
couple
of
pairs
of
boxer
shorts
and
tied
one
around
his
bicep
and
the
other
around
his
shoulder
using
his
teeth
and
chin
as
a
second
hand
it
took
two
tries
before
he
had
them
bound
tight
enough
to
still
the
throb
the
bedroom
looked
like
someone
had
butchered
an
animal
in
it
and
the
floor
was
gritty
with
darrel
leavings
teeth
and
nails
and
fingerbones
picking
his
way
carefully
through
the
mess
he
hauled
the
sheet
off
the
bed
popping
out
the
remaining
staples
which
pinged
off
the
bookcases
and
danced
on
the
polished
wood
of
the
floor
he
folded
it
double
and
laid
it
on
the
floor
next
to
davey
help
me
roll
him
onto
it
he
said
and
then
saw
that
kurt
was
staring
down
at
his
shriveled
squirming
hateful
brother
in
horror
wiping
his
hands
over
and
over
again
on
the
thighs
of
his
jeans
he
looked
up
and
his
eyes
were
glazed
and
wide
i
was
passing
by
and
i
saw
the
shadows
in
the
window
i
thought
you
were
being
attacked
he
hugged
himself
i
was
alan
said
he
dug
another
out
of
his
hamper
here
wrap
this
around
your
hands
they
rolled
davey
into
the
sheet
and
then
wrapped
him
in
it
he
was
surprisingly
heavy
dense
hefting
his
end
of
the
sheet
hefting
that
mysterious
weight
he
remembered
picking
up
in
the
cave
that
first
day
remembered
the
weight
of
the
and
he
had
a
sudden
sickening
sense
that
perhaps
davey
was
so
heavy
because
he
eaten
them
once
they
had
him
bound
snugly
in
the
sheet
danny
stopped
thrashing
and
became
very
still
they
carried
him
carefully
down
the
dark
stairs
the
grit
echoing
the
feel
of
teeth
and
flakes
of
skin
on
the
bare
soles
of
alan
feet
they
dumped
him
unceremoniously
on
the
cool
mosaic
of
tile
on
the
floor
they
stared
at
the
unmoving
bundle
for
a
moment
wait
here
going
to
get
a
chair
alan
said
jesus
do
leave
me
alone
here
kurt
said
that
kid
the
one
who
saw
him
take
your
brother
no
one
seen
him
since
he
looked
down
at
davey
with
wide
crazed
eyes
alan
shoulder
throbbed
all
right
he
said
you
get
a
chair
from
the
kitchen
the
captain
chair
in
the
corner
with
the
newspaper
recycling
stacked
on
it
while
kurt
was
upstairs
alan
unwrapped
his
brother
danny
eyes
were
closed
his
jaw
hanging
askew
his
wrists
bound
behind
him
alan
leaned
carefully
over
him
and
took
his
jaw
and
rotated
it
gently
until
it
popped
back
into
place
davey
he
said
the
eyes
were
closed
but
now
there
was
an
attentiveness
an
alertness
to
him
alan
stepped
back
quickly
feeling
foolish
at
his
fear
of
this
pathetic
disjointed
bound
thing
on
his
floor
no
two
ways
about
it
though
davey
gave
him
the
absolutely
willies
making
his
testicles
draw
up
and
the
hair
on
the
back
of
his
arms
prickle
set
the
chair
down
there
alan
said
pointing
he
hoisted
davey
up
by
his
dry
papery
armpits
and
sat
him
in
the
seat
he
took
some
duct
tape
out
of
a
utility
drawer
under
the
basement
staircase
and
used
it
to
gum
danny
down
in
the
chair
davey
he
said
again
i
know
you
can
hear
me
stop
pretending
that
your
brother
kurt
said
the
one
who
that
him
alan
said
i
guess
you
believe
me
now
huh
davey
grinned
suddenly
mirthless
still
making
friends
and
influencing
people
brother
he
said
his
voice
was
wet
and
hiccuping
like
he
was
drowning
in
snot
we
not
going
to
play
any
games
here
davey
you
going
to
tell
me
where
edward
felix
and
griffin
are
or
i
going
to
tear
your
fingers
off
and
smash
them
into
powder
when
i
run
out
of
fingers
i
switch
to
teeth
kurt
looked
at
him
in
alarm
he
moaned
jesus
adam
adam
whirled
on
him
something
snapping
inside
do
kurt
just
do
okay
he
tried
to
kill
me
tonight
he
may
already
have
killed
my
brothers
this
is
life
or
death
and
there
no
room
for
sentiment
or
humanity
get
a
hammer
out
of
the
toolbox
on
that
shelf
kurt
hesitated
do
it
alan
said
pointing
at
the
toolbox
kurt
shrank
back
looking
as
though
he
been
slapped
he
moved
as
if
in
a
dream
opening
the
toolbox
and
pawing
through
it
until
he
came
up
with
a
scarred
hammer
one
claw
snapped
off
davey
shook
his
head
you
do
scare
me
albert
not
for
an
instant
i
have
a
large
supply
of
fingers
and
teeth
all
i
need
and
you
you
like
him
you
a
sentimentalist
scared
of
yourself
scared
of
me
scared
of
everything
that
why
you
ran
away
that
why
you
got
rid
of
me
scared
alan
dug
in
his
pocket
for
the
fingerbones
and
teeth
he
collected
he
found
the
tip
of
a
pinky
with
a
nail
as
thick
as
an
shell
crusted
with
dirt
and
blood
give
me
the
hammer
kurt
he
said
davey
eyes
followed
him
as
he
set
the
fingertip
down
on
the
tiles
and
raised
the
hammer
he
brought
it
down
just
to
one
side
of
the
finger
hard
enough
to
break
the
tile
kurt
jumped
a
little
and
alan
held
the
hammer
up
again
tell
me
or
this
time
i
wo
miss
he
said
looking
davey
in
the
eye
davey
shrugged
in
his
bonds
alan
swung
the
hammer
again
it
hit
the
fingertip
with
a
jarring
impact
that
vibrated
up
his
arm
and
resonated
through
his
hurt
shoulder
he
raised
the
hammer
again
he
expected
the
finger
to
crush
into
powder
but
instead
it
fissured
into
three
jagged
pieces
like
a
piece
of
chert
fracturing
under
a
davey
eyes
were
squeezed
down
to
slits
now
you
the
scared
one
you
ca
scare
me
he
said
his
voice
choked
with
phlegm
alan
sat
on
the
irregular
tile
and
propped
his
chin
in
his
palm
okay
davey
you
right
i
scared
you
kidnapped
our
brothers
maybe
even
killed
them
you
terrorizing
me
i
ca
think

so

me
danny
why
should
i
just
kill
you
again
and
get
rid
of
all
that
fear
i
know
where
the
brothers
are
he
said
instantly
i
know
where
there
are
more
people
like
us
all
the
answers
albert
every
answer
ever
looked
for
i
got
them
and
i
wo
tell
you
any
of
them
but
so
long
as
i
walking
around
and
talking
you
think
that
i
might
alan
took
marci
back
to
his
bedroom
the
winter
bedroom
that
was
no
more
than
a
niche
in
the
cavern
a
pile
of
rags
and
a
sleeping
bag
for
a
bed
it
had
always
been
enough
for
him
but
now
he
was
ashamed
of
it
he
took
the
flashlight
from
marci
and
let
it
wind
down
so
that
they
were
sitting
in
darkness
your
parents
she
said
then
broke
off
it
complicated
are
they
dead
he
reached
out
in
the
dark
and
took
her
hand
i
do
know
how
to
explain
it
he
said
i
can
lie
and
probably
think
i
telling
the
truth
or
i
can
tell
the
truth
and
you
think
that
i
lying
she
squeezed
his
hand
despite
the
sweaty
heat
of
the
cave
her
fingers
were
cold
as
ice
he
covered
her
hand
with
his
free
hand
and
rubbed
at
her
cold
fingers
tell
me
the
truth
she
whispered
i
believe
you
so
he
did
in
mutters
and
whispers
he
did
have
the
words
to
explain
it
all
did
know
exactly
how
to
explain
it
but
he
tried
how
he
knew
his
father
moods
how
he
felt
his
mother
love
after
keeping
this
secret
all
his
life
it
felt
incredible
to
be
letting
it
out
his
heart
thudded
in
his
chest
and
his
shoulders
felt
progressively
lighter
until
he
thought
he
might
rise
up
off
his
bedding
and
fly
around
the
cave
if
it
had
been
dark
he
would
have
been
able
to
tell
it
it
was
the
dark
and
the
faint
lunar
glow
of
marci
face
that
showed
no
expression
that
let
him
open
up
and
spill
out
all
the
secrets
her
fingers
squeezed
tighter
and
tighter
and
now
he
felt
like
singing
and
dancing
because
surely
between
the
two
of
them
they
could
find
a
book
in
the
library
or
maybe
an
article
in
the
microfilm
cabinets
that
would
explain
it
to
him
he
wound
down
no
one
else
knows
this
he
said
no
one
except
you
he
leaned
in
and
planted
a
kiss
on
her
cold
lips
she
sat
rigid
and
unmoving
as
he
kissed
her
marci
alan
she
breathed
her
fingers
went
slack
she
pulled
her
hand
free
suddenly
alan
was
cold
too
the
scant
inches
between
them
felt
like
an
unbridgeable
gap
you
think
i
lying
he
said
staring
out
into
the
cave
i
do
know
it
okay
he
said
i
can
help
you
get
home
now
all
right
she
folded
her
hands
on
her
lap
and
nodded
miserably
on
the
way
out
of
the
cave
tottered
over
still
holding
his
car
he
held
it
out
to
her
mutely
she
knelt
down
solemnly
and
took
it
from
him
then
patted
him
on
the
head
merry
christmas
kiddo
she
said
he
hugged
her
leg
and
she
laughed
a
little
and
bent
to
pick
him
up
she
could
he
was
too
heavy
she
let
go
of
him
and
nervously
pried
his
arms
from
around
her
thigh
alan
took
her
down
the
path
to
the
side
road
that
led
into
town
the
moonlight
shone
on
the
white
snow
making
the
world
glow
bluish
they
stood
by
the
roadside
for
a
long
and
awkward
moment
good
night
alan
she
said
and
turned
and
started
trudging
home
there
was
no
torture
at
school
the
next
day
she
ignored
him
through
the
morning
and
he
could
find
her
at
recess
but
at
lunch
she
came
and
sat
next
to
him
they
ate
in
silence
but
he
was
comforted
by
her
presence
beside
him
a
warmth
that
he
sensed
more
than
felt
she
sat
beside
him
in
afternoon
classes
too
not
a
word
passed
between
them
for
alan
it
felt
like
anything
they
could
say
to
one
another
would
be
less
true
than
the
silence
but
that
realization
hurt
never
been
able
to
discuss
his
life
and
nature
with
anyone
and
it
seemed
as
though
he
never
would
but
the
next
morning
in
the
school
yard
she
snagged
him
as
he
walked
past
the
climber
made
from
a
jumble
of
logs
and
dragged
him
into
the
middle
it
smelled
faintly
of
pee
and
was
a
rich
source
of
mysterious
roaches
and
empty
beer
bottles
on
monday
mornings
after
the
teenagers
had
come
and
gone
she
was
crouched
down
on
her
haunches
in
the
snow
there
her
steaming
breath
coming
in
short
huffs
she
grabbed
him
by
the
back
of
his
knit
toque
and
pulled
his
face
to
hers
kissing
him
hard
on
the
mouth
shocking
the
hell
out
of
him
by
forcing
her
tongue
past
his
lips
they
kissed
until
the
bell
rang
and
as
alan
made
his
way
to
class
he
felt
like
his
face
was
glowing
like
a
lightbulb
his
homeroom
teacher
asked
him
if
he
was
feeling
well
and
he
stammered
out
some
kind
of
affirmative
while
marci
sitting
in
the
next
row
stifled
a
giggle
they
ate
their
lunches
together
again
and
she
filled
the
silence
with
a
running
commentary
of
the
deficiencies
of
the
sandwich
her
father
had
packed
her
the
strange
odors
coming
from
the
brown
bag
that
alan
had
brought
filled
with
winter
mushrooms
and
some
soggy
bread
and
cheese
and
the
hairiness
of
the
mole
on
the
lunch
lady
chin
when
they
reached
the
schoolyard
she
tried
to
drag
him
back
to
the
logs
but
he
resisted
taking
her
instead
to
the
marsh
where
he
first
spied
her
the
ground
had
frozen
over
and
the
rushes
and
reeds
were
stubble
poking
out
of
the
snow
he
took
her
mittened
hands
in
his
and
waited
for
her
to
stop
squirming
which
she
did
eventually
he
rehearsed
what
he
say
to
her
all
morning
you
believe
me
what
am
i
am
i
like
you
do
you
still
love
me
are
you
still
my
friend
i
do
understand
it
any
better
than
you
do
but
now
now
there
are
two
of
us
who
know
about
it
and
maybe
we
can
make
sense
of
it
together
god
it
such
a
relief
to
not
be
the
only
one
anymore
but
now
standing
there
with
marci
in
the
distant
catcalls
of
the
playground
and
the
smell
of
the
new
snow
and
the
soughing
of
the
wind
in
the
trees
he
could
bring
himself
to
say
it
she
either
knew
these
things
or
she
did
and
if
she
did
he
did
know
what
he
could
do
to
help
it
what
she
said
at
last
do
you
he
began
then
fell
silent
he
could
say
the
words
she
looked
irritated
and
the
sounds
and
the
smells
swept
over
him
as
the
moment
stretched
but
then
she
softened
i
do
understand
it
alan
she
said
is
it
true
is
it
really
how
you
say
it
is
did
i
see
what
i
saw
it
true
he
said
and
it
was
as
though
the
clouds
had
parted
the
world
gone
bright
with
the
glare
off
the
snow
and
the
sounds
from
the
playground
now
joyous
instead
of
cruel
it
true
and
i
understand
it
any
more
than
you
do
marci
are
you
alan
i
so
he
said
i
bleed
i
eat
i
sleep
i
think
and
talk
and
dream
she
squeezed
his
hands
and
darted
a
kiss
at
him
you
kiss
she
said
and
it
was
all
right
again
the
next
day
was
saturday
and
marci
arranged
to
meet
him
at
the
in
the
lee
of
the
wind
the
bright
winter
sun
reflected
enough
heat
off
the
snow
that
some
of
it
melted
away
revealing
the
stunted
winter
grass
beneath
they
sat
on
the
dry
snow
and
listened
to
the
wind
whistle
through
the
pines
and
the
hiss
of
loose
snow
blowing
across
the
crust
will
i
get
to
meet
your
da
then
she
said
after
they
watched
a
jackrabbit
hop
up
the
mountainside
and
disappear
into
the
woods
he
sniffed
deeply
and
smelled
the
coalface
smell
of
his
cogitation
you
want
to
he
said
i
do
and
so
he
led
her
inside
the
mountain
through
the
winter
cave
and
back
and
back
to
the
pool
in
the
mountain
heart
they
crept
along
quietly
her
fingers
twined
in
his
you
have
to
put
out
the
flashlight
now
he
said
it
scare
the
goblin
his
voice
shocked
him
and
her
he
felt
her
startle
it
was
so
quiet
otherwise
just
the
sounds
of
breathing
and
of
cave
winds
so
she
let
the
whirring
dynamo
in
the
flashlight
wind
down
and
the
darkness
descended
on
them
it
was
cool
but
not
cold
and
the
wind
smelled
more
strongly
of
coalface
than
ever
he
in
there
alan
said
he
heard
the
goblin
scamper
away
his
words
echoed
over
the
pool
around
the
corner
come
on
her
fingers
were
very
cool
they
walked
in
a
slow
measured
step
like
a
king
and
queen
of
elfland
going
for
a
walk
in
the
woods
he
stopped
them
at
the
pool
edge
there
was
almost
no
light
here
but
alan
could
make
out
the
smooth
surface
of
his
father
pool
now
what
she
whispered
the
hissing
of
her
words
susurrating
over
the
pool
surface
we
can
only
talk
to
him
from
the
center
he
whispered
we
have
to
wade
in
i
ca
go
home
with
wet
clothes
she
whispered
you
do
wear
clothes
he
said
he
let
go
of
her
hand
and
began
to
unzip
his
snowsuit
and
so
they
stripped
there
on
his
father
shore
she
was
luminous
in
the
dark
a
pale
picked
out
in
the
ripples
of
the
pool
skinny
with
her
arms
crossed
in
front
of
her
chest
even
though
he
knew
she
could
see
him
he
was
in
his
nudity
and
he
stepped
into
the
pool
as
soon
as
he
was
naked
wait
she
said
sounding
panicked
do
leave
me
so
he
held
out
his
hand
for
her
and
then
realizing
that
she
see
it
he
stepped
out
of
the
pool
and
took
her
hand
brushing
her
small
breast
as
he
did
so
he
barely
registered
the
contact
though
she
startled
and
nearly
fell
over
sorry
he
said
come
on
the
water
was
cold
but
once
they
were
in
up
to
their
shoulders
it
warmed
up
or
they
went
numb
is
it
okay
she
whispered
and
now
that
they
were
in
the
center
of
the
cavern
the
echoes
crossed
back
and
forth
and
took
a
long
time
to
die
out
listen
andy
said
just
listen
and
as
the
echoes
of
his
words
died
down
the
winds
picked
up
and
then
the
words
emerged
from
the
breeze
adam
his
father
sighed
marci
jumped
a
foot
out
of
the
water
and
her
splashdown
sent
watery
ripples
rebounding
off
the
cavern
walls
alan
reached
out
for
her
and
draped
his
arm
around
her
shoulders
she
huddled
against
his
chest
slick
cold
naked
skin
against
his
ribs
she
smelled
wonderful
like
a
fox
it
wonderful
and
solemn
to
stand
there
nude
in
the
heart
of
his
father
and
let
his
secrets
spill
away
her
breathing
stilled
again
alan
his
father
said
we
want
to
understand
father
alan
whispered
what
am
i
it
was
the
question
he
never
asked
now
that
he
asked
it
he
felt
like
a
fool
surely
his
father
the
mountain
knew
everything
had
stood
forever
he
could
have
found
out
anytime
he
thought
to
ask
i
do
have
the
answer
his
father
said
there
may
be
no
answer
you
may
never
know
adam
let
go
of
marci
let
his
arms
fall
to
his
sides
no
he
said
no
he
shouted
again
and
the
stillness
was
broken
the
wind
blew
cold
and
hard
and
he
did
care
he
screamed
and
marci
grabbed
him
and
put
her
hand
over
his
mouth
his
ears
roared
with
echoes
and
they
did
not
die
down
but
rather
built
atop
one
another
to
a
wall
of
noise
that
scared
him
she
was
crying
now
scared
and
openmouthed
sobs
she
splashed
him
and
water
went
up
his
nose
and
stung
his
eyes
the
wind
was
colder
now
cold
enough
to
hurt
and
he
took
her
hand
and
sloshed
recklessly
for
the
shore
he
spun
up
the
flashlight
and
handed
it
to
her
then
yanked
his
clothes
over
his
wet
skin
glaring
at
the
pool
while
she
did
the
same
in
the
winter
cave
they
met
a
golem
it
stood
like
a
statue
with
glowing
eyes
beside
mother
hands
at
its
sides
golems
did
venture
to
this
side
of
his
father
very
often
and
almost
never
in
daylight
marci
caught
him
in
the
flashlight
beam
as
they
entered
the
warm
humidity
of
the
cave
shivering
in
the
gusting
winds
she
fumbled
the
flashlight
and
alan
caught
it
before
it
hit
the
ground
it
okay
he
said
his
chest
was
heaving
from
his
tantrum
but
the
presence
of
the
golem
calmed
him
you
could
say
or
do
anything
to
a
golem
and
it
could
strike
back
could
answer
back
the
sons
of
the
mountain
that
sheltered
and
birthed
the
golems
owed
nothing
to
them
he
walked
over
to
it
and
folded
his
arms
what
is
it
he
said
the
golem
bent
its
head
slightly
and
looked
him
in
the
eye
it
was
but
baggier
muscles
like
frozen
mud
an
overhang
of
belly
covered
its
smooth
crotch
like
a
kilt
its
teeth
clacked
together
as
it
limbered
up
its
jaw
your
father
is
sad
it
said
its
voice
was
slow
and
grinding
like
an
avalanche
our
side
grows
cold
i
do
care
alan
said
my
father
he
said
behind
him
perched
atop
their
mother
davey
whittered
a
mean
little
laugh
you
should
alan
shoved
the
golem
it
was
like
shoving
a
boulder
it
did
give
at
all
you
do
tell
me
what
to
do
he
said
you
ca
tell
me
what
to
do
i
want
to
know
what
i
am
how
we
possible
and
if
you
ca
help
then
you
can
leave
now
the
winds
blew
colder
smelling
now
of
the
golem
side
of
the
mountain
of
clay
and
the
dry
bones
of
their
kills
which
they
arrayed
on
the
walls
of
their
cavern
the
golem
stood
stock
still
does
it
marci
asked
davey
snickered
again
it
not
stupid
alan
said
calming
a
little
it
it
thinks
slowly
and
acts
slowly
but
it
not
stupid
he
paused
for
a
moment
it
taught
me
to
speak
he
said
that
did
it
he
began
to
cry
biting
his
lip
to
keep
from
making
a
sound
but
the
tears
rolled
down
his
cheeks
and
his
shoulders
shook
the
flashlight
beam
pinned
him
and
he
wanted
to
run
to
his
mother
and
hide
behind
her
wanted
to
escape
the
light
go
he
said
softly
to
the
golem
touching
its
elbow
it
be
all
right
slowly
gratingly
the
golem
turned
and
lumbered
out
of
the
cave
clumsy
and
ponderous
marci
put
her
arm
around
him
and
he
buried
his
face
in
her
skinny
neck
the
hot
tears
coursing
down
her
collarbones
davey
came
to
him
that
night
and
pinned
him
in
the
light
of
the
flashlight
he
woke
staring
up
into
the
bright
bulb
shielding
his
eyes
he
groped
out
for
the
light
but
darryl
danced
back
out
of
reach
keeping
the
beam
in
his
eyes
the
air
crackled
with
the
angry
grinding
of
its
he
climbed
out
of
bed
naked
and
felt
around
on
the
floor
he
had
a
geode
there
he
broken
it
and
polished
it
by
hand
and
it
was
the
size
of
a
softball
the
top
smooth
as
glass
the
underside
rough
as
a
hide
wordless
and
swift
he
wound
up
and
threw
the
geode
as
hard
as
he
could
at
where
he
judged
davey
head
to
be
there
was
a
thud
and
a
cry
and
the
light
clattered
to
the
ground
growing
more
dim
as
its
dynamo
whirred
to
a
stop
green
blobs
chased
themselves
across
his
vision
and
he
could
only
see
darren
rolling
on
the
ground
by
turning
his
head
to
one
side
and
looking
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
he
groped
toward
davey
and
smelled
the
blood
kneeling
down
he
found
davey
hand
and
followed
it
up
to
his
shoulder
his
neck
slick
with
blood
higher
to
davey
face
his
forehead
the
dent
there
sanded
ragged
by
the
rough
side
of
the
geode
the
blood
flowed
freely
and
beneath
his
other
hand
danny
chest
heaved
as
he
breathed
shallowly
rapidly
almost
panting
his
vision
was
coming
back
now
he
took
off
his
and
wadded
it
up
pressed
it
to
davey
forehead
they
done
first
aid
in
class
you
were
supposed
to
move
someone
with
a
head
injury
he
pressed
down
with
the
trying
to
stanch
the
blood
then
quick
as
a
whip
davey
head
twisted
around
and
he
bit
down
hard
on
alan
thumbtip
albert
reeled
back
but
it
was
too
late
davey
had
bitten
off
the
tip
of
his
right
thumb
alan
howled
waking
up
who
began
to
cry
davey
rolled
away
scampering
back
into
the
cave
depths
alan
danced
around
the
cave
hand
clamped
between
his
thighs
mewling
he
fell
to
the
floor
and
squeezed
his
legs
together
then
slowly
brought
his
hand
up
before
his
face
the
ragged
stump
of
his
thumb
was
softly
spurting
blood
in
time
with
his
heartbeat
he
struggled
to
remember
his
first
aid
he
wrapped
his
around
the
wound
and
then
pulled
his
parka
on
over
his
bare
chest
and
jammed
his
bare
feet
into
his
boots
then
made
his
way
to
the
cave
mouth
and
scooped
up
snow
under
the
moon
glow
awkwardly
packing
a
snowball
around
his
hand
he
shivered
as
he
made
his
way
back
into
the
winter
cave
and
propped
himself
up
against
his
mother
holding
his
hurt
hand
over
his
head
the
winter
cave
grew
cold
as
the
ice
packed
around
his
hand
bobby
woken
by
his
clairvoyant
instincts
crept
forward
with
a
sheet
and
draped
it
over
alan
he
foreseen
this
of
course
had
foreseen
all
of
it
but
bobby
followed
his
own
code
and
he
kept
his
own
counsel
cleaning
up
after
the
disasters
he
was
powerless
to
prevent
deep
in
the
mountains
they
heard
the
echoes
of
davey
tittering
laughter
it
was
wrong
to
bring
her
here
adam
billy
said
to
him
in
the
morning
as
he
fed
alan
the
crusts
of
bread
and
dried
apples
brought
him
packing
his
hand
with
fresh
snow
i
did
bring
her
here
she
followed
me
adam
said
his
arm
ached
from
holding
it
aloft
and
his
back
and
tailbone
were
numb
with
the
ache
of
a
night
spent
sitting
up
against
their
mother
side
and
besides
why
should
it
be
wrong
whose
rules
what
rules
what
are
the
rules
you
can
feel
the
rules
brother
he
said
he
could
look
alan
in
the
eye
he
never
did
this
was
a
major
speech
coming
from
bobby
i
ca
feel
any
rules
alan
said
he
wondered
if
it
was
true
never
told
anyone
about
the
family
before
had
he
known
all
along
that
he
should
do
this
i
can
she
ca
know
no
one
can
know
even
we
ca
know
we
never
understand
it
where
is
davey
he
doing
a
ritual
with
your
thumb
they
sat
silent
and
strained
their
ears
to
hear
the
winds
and
the
distant
shuffle
of
the
denizens
of
the
mountain
alan
shifted
using
his
good
hand
to
prop
himself
up
looking
for
a
comfortable
position
he
brought
his
injured
hand
down
to
his
lap
and
unwrapped
his
from
his
fist
gently
peeling
it
away
from
the
glue
of
dried
blood
that
held
it
there
his
hand
had
shriveled
in
the
night
from
ice
and
from
restricted
circulation
and
maybe
from
davey
ritual
alan
pondered
its
crusty
clawed
form
thinking
that
it
looked
like
it
belonged
to
someone
else
buddy
scaled
the
stalactite
that
served
as
the
ladder
up
to
the
lofty
nook
where
he
slept
and
came
back
down
holding
his
water
bottle
clean
it
from
the
pool
he
said
another
major
speech
for
him
he
also
had
an
armload
of
scavenged
diapers
and
worn
soft
as
flannel
he
wet
one
and
began
to
wipe
away
the
crust
of
blood
on
arm
and
hand
working
his
way
up
from
the
elbow
then
tackling
the
uninjured
fingers
then
very
gently
gently
as
a
slow
as
a
glacier
he
worked
on
alan
thumb
when
he
was
done
alan
hand
was
clean
and
dry
and
cold
and
the
wound
of
his
thumb
was
exposed
and
naked
a
thin
crust
of
blood
weeping
liquid
slowly
it
seemed
to
alan
that
he
could
see
the
stump
of
bone
protruding
from
the
wound
he
was
amazed
to
see
his
bones
to
get
a
look
at
a
of
himself
he
wondered
if
he
could
count
the
rings
and
find
out
how
old
he
was
as
he
had
never
been
really
certain
on
that
score
he
giggled
ghoulishly
he
held
out
his
good
hand
get
me
up
okay
bobby
hauled
him
to
his
feet
get
me
some
warm
clothes
too
and
he
did
because
he
was
bobby
and
he
was
always
only
too
glad
to
help
only
too
glad
to
do
what
service
he
could
for
you
even
if
he
would
never
do
you
the
one
service
that
would
benefit
you
the
most
telling
you
of
his
visions
helping
you
avoid
the
disasters
that
loomed
on
your
horizon
standing
up
walking
around
being
clean
he
began
to
feel
like
himself
again
he
even
managed
to
get
into
his
snow
pants
and
parka
and
struggle
out
to
the
hillside
and
the
bright
sunshine
where
he
could
get
a
good
look
at
his
hand
what
he
had
taken
for
a
bone
was
it
was
a
skinny
little
thumbtip
growing
out
of
the
raggedy
crusty
stump
he
could
see
the
whorl
of
a
fingerprint
there
and
narrow
nearly
invisible
cuticles
he
touched
the
tip
of
his
tongue
to
it
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
could
feel
a
tongue
rasping
over
the
top
of
his
missing
thumbtip
it
disgusting
keep
it
away
marci
said
shrinking
away
from
his
hand
in
mock
horror
he
held
his
under
her
nose
and
waggled
it
no
joking
okay
i
just
want
to
know
what
it
i
a
new
maybe
you
part
salamander
they
regrow
their
legs
and
tails
or
a
worm
cut
a
worm
in
half
and
you
get
two
worms
it
in
one
of
my
books
he
stared
at
his
thumb
it
had
grown
perceptibly
just
on
the
journey
into
town
to
marci
place
they
were
holed
up
in
her
room
surrounded
by
watercolors
of
horses
in
motion
that
her
mother
had
painted
raided
the
fridge
for
cold
pork
pies
and
cheese
and
fizzy
lemonade
that
her
father
had
shipped
from
the
marks
spencer
in
toronto
it
was
the
strangest
food
he
ever
eaten
but
he
developed
a
taste
for
it
wiggle
it
again
she
said
he
did
and
the
thumbtip
bent
down
like
a
scale
model
of
a
thumbtip
cracking
the
scab
around
it
we
should
go
to
a
doctor
she
said
i
do
go
to
doctors
he
said
flatly
you
gone
to
a
doctor
does
mean
you
ca
i
do
go
to
doctors
machines
and
stethoscopes
blood
tests
and
clever
little
flashlights
in
your
ears
who
knew
what
reveal
he
wanted
to
be
the
first
to
discover
it
he
did
want
to
have
to
try
to
explain
it
to
a
doctor
before
he
understood
it
himself
not
even
when
you
sick
the
golems
take
care
of
it
he
said
she
shook
her
head
you
a
weirdo
you
know
that
i
know
it
he
said
i
thought
my
family
was
strange
she
said
stretching
out
on
her
tummy
on
the
bed
but
they
not
a
patch
on
you
i
know
it
he
finished
his
fizzy
lemonade
and
lay
down
beside
her
belching
we
could
ask
my
da
he
knows
a
lot
of
strange
things
he
put
his
face
down
in
her
duvet
and
smelled
the
cotton
covers
and
her
nighttime
sweat
like
a
spice
like
cinnamon
i
do
want
to
do
that
please
do
tell
anyone
all
right
she
took
hold
of
his
wrist
and
looked
again
at
the
teensy
thumb
wiggle
it
again
she
said
he
did
she
giggled
imagine
if
you
were
like
a
worm
imagine
if
your
thumbtip
was
out
there
growing
another
he
sat
bolt
upright
do
you
think
that
possible
he
said
his
heart
was
thudding
do
you
think
so
she
rolled
on
her
side
and
stared
at
him
no
do
be
daft
how
could
your
thumb
grow
another
why
would
it
she
had
no
answer
for
him
i
need
to
go
home
he
said
i
need
to
know
i
coming
with
she
said
he
opened
his
mouth
to
tell
her
no
but
she
made
a
fierce
face
at
him
her
foxy
features
wrinkled
into
a
mock
snarl
come
along
then
he
said
you
can
help
me
do
up
my
coat
the
winter
cave
was
deserted
he
listened
at
the
mouths
of
all
the
tunnels
straining
to
hear
davey
from
his
high
nook
brian
watched
them
where
is
he
billy
alan
called
tell
me
godfuckit
billy
looked
down
from
him
perch
with
his
sad
hollow
eyes
had
he
been
forgetting
to
eat
again
and
shook
his
head
they
took
to
the
tunnels
even
with
the
flashlight
marci
could
match
him
for
speed
he
could
feel
the
tunnels
through
the
soles
of
his
boots
he
could
smell
them
he
could
pick
them
apart
by
the
quality
of
their
echoes
he
moved
fast
dragging
marci
along
with
his
good
hand
while
she
cranked
the
flashlight
as
hard
as
she
could
he
heard
her
panting
triangulated
their
location
from
the
way
that
the
shallow
noises
reflected
off
the
walls
when
they
found
davey
at
last
it
was
in
the
golem
cave
on
the
other
side
of
the
mountain
he
was
hunkered
down
in
a
corner
while
the
golems
moved
around
him
slowly
avoiding
him
like
he
was
a
boulder
or
a
stalagmite
that
had
sprung
up
in
the
night
their
stony
heads
turned
to
regard
marci
and
adam
as
they
came
upon
them
their
luminous
eyes
lighting
on
them
for
a
moment
and
then
moving
on
it
was
an
eloquent
statement
for
them
is
the
business
of
the
mountain
and
his
sons
we
will
not
intervene
there
were
more
golems
than
alan
could
remember
seeing
at
once
six
maybe
seven
the
golems
made
more
of
their
kind
from
the
clay
they
found
at
the
riverbank
whenever
they
cared
to
or
needed
to
and
allowed
their
number
to
dwindle
when
the
need
or
want
had
passed
by
the
simple
expedient
of
deconstructing
one
of
their
own
back
to
the
clay
it
had
come
from
the
golems
cave
was
lined
with
small
bones
and
skulls
rank
and
row
climbing
the
walls
twined
with
dried
grasses
in
ascending
geometries
these
were
the
furry
animals
that
the
golems
patiently
trapped
and
killed
skinned
dressed
and
smoked
laying
them
in
small
bundles
in
the
family
cave
when
they
were
done
it
was
part
of
their
unspoken
bargain
with
the
mountain
and
the
tiny
bones
had
once
borne
the
flesh
of
nearly
every
significant
meal
alan
had
ever
eaten
davey
crouched
among
the
bones
at
the
very
back
of
the
cave
his
back
to
them
shoulders
hunched
the
golems
stood
stock
still
as
marci
and
he
crept
up
on
davey
so
intent
was
he
on
his
work
that
he
did
notice
them
even
as
they
loomed
over
his
shoulder
staring
down
on
the
thing
he
held
in
his
hands
it
was
alan
thumb
and
growing
out
of
it
allen
tiny
the
size
of
a
man
and
just
as
skinny
but
perfectly
formed
squirming
and
insensate
face
contorted
in
a
tiny
expression
of
horror
not
so
perfectly
formed
alan
saw
once
he
was
over
the
initial
shock
one
of
the
arms
was
missing
protruding
there
from
davey
mouth
and
he
crunched
it
with
relish
alan
gawped
at
it
taking
it
in
watching
his
miniature
doppelganger
hardly
bigger
than
the
thumb
it
sprouted
from
thrash
like
a
worm
on
a
hook
davey
finished
the
arm
slurping
it
back
like
a
noodle
then
he
dangled
the
tiny
allen
from
the
thumb
shaking
it
before
taking
hold
of
the
legs
one
between
the
thumb
and
forefinger
of
each
hand
and
he
gently
almost
lovingly
pulled
them
apart
the
allen
screamed
a
sound
as
tiny
and
tortured
as
a
cricket
song
and
then
the
left
leg
wrenched
free
of
its
socket
alan
felt
his
own
leg
twist
in
sympathy
and
then
there
was
a
killing
rage
in
him
he
looked
around
the
cave
for
the
thing
that
would
let
him
murder
his
brother
for
once
and
for
all
but
it
was
to
be
found
davey
murder
was
still
to
come
instead
he
leapt
on
davey
back
arm
around
his
neck
hand
gripping
his
choking
fist
pulling
the
headlock
tighter
and
tighter
marci
was
screaming
something
but
she
was
lost
in
the
crash
of
the
that
roared
in
his
ears
davey
pitched
over
backward
trying
to
buck
him
off
but
he
would
be
thrown
and
he
flipped
davey
over
by
the
neck
so
that
he
landed
it
a
thrash
of
skinny
arms
and
legs
the
allen
fell
to
the
floor
weeping
and
dragging
itself
and
away
from
the
melee
then
davey
was
on
him
squeezing
his
injured
hand
other
thumb
in
his
eye
screeching
like
a
rusted
hinge
alan
tried
to
see
through
the
tears
that
sprang
up
tried
to
reach
davey
with
his
good
hand
but
the
rage
was
leaking
out
of
him
now
he
rolled
desperately
but
davey
weight
on
his
chest
was
like
a
cannonball
impossibly
heavy
suddenly
davey
was
lifted
off
of
him
alan
struggled
up
into
a
sitting
position
clutching
his
injured
hand
davey
dangled
by
his
armpits
in
the
implacable
hands
of
one
of
the
golems
face
contorted
into
unrecognizability
alan
stood
and
confronted
him
just
out
of
range
of
his
kicking
feet
and
his
gnashing
teeth
and
darrel
spat
in
his
face
a
searing
gob
that
landed
in
his
eye
marci
took
his
arm
and
dragged
him
back
toward
the
cave
mouth
he
fought
her
looking
for
the
little
allen
not
seeing
him
was
that
him
there
in
the
shadows
no
that
was
one
of
the
little
bone
tableaux
a
field
mouse
dried
bones
splayed
in
an
anatomically
correct
mystic
hieroglyph
marci
hauled
him
away
out
into
the
bright
snow
and
the
bright
sun
his
thumb
was
bleeding
anew
dripping
fat
drops
the
color
of
a
red
crayon
into
the
sun
blood
so
hot
it
seemed
to
sizzle
and
sink
into
the
snow
you
need
to
tell
an
adult
alan
she
said
wrapping
his
new
little
thumb
in
gauze
she
taken
from
her
pocket
my
father
knows
my
mother
knows
he
sat
with
his
head
between
his
knees
not
daring
to
look
at
her
in
his
nook
in
the
winter
cave
she
just
looked
at
him
squinting
they
count
he
said
they
understand
it
she
shook
her
head
they
understand
it
better
than
any
adult
you
know
would
this
will
get
better
on
its
own
marci
look
he
wiggled
his
thumb
at
her
it
was
now
the
size
of
the
tip
of
his
pinky
and
had
a
nail
and
cuticle
that
not
all
that
has
to
get
better
she
said
you
ca
just
let
this
fester
your
brother
that
in
the
cave
she
shook
her
head
someone
needs
to
know
about
this
you
not
safe
promise
me
you
wo
tell
anyone
marci
this
is
important
no
one
except
you
knows
and
that
how
it
has
to
be
if
you
tell
what
she
got
up
and
pulled
her
coat
on
what
alan
if
i
tell
and
try
to
help
you
what
will
you
do
to
me
i
do
know
he
mumbled
into
his
chest
well
you
do
whatever
you
have
to
do
she
said
and
stomped
out
of
the
cave
davey
escaped
at
dawn
kurt
had
gone
outside
to
repark
his
old
buick
the
trunk
bungeed
shut
over
his
haul
of
lcd
flat
panels
empty
cartridges
and
open
gift
baskets
of
pricey
japanese
cosmetics
alan
and
davey
just
glared
at
each
other
but
then
davey
closed
his
eyes
and
began
to
snore
softly
and
even
though
alan
paced
and
pinched
the
bridge
of
his
nose
and
stretched
out
his
injured
arm
he
could
help
it
when
he
sat
down
and
closed
his
eyes
and
nodded
off
alan
woke
with
a
start
staring
at
the
empty
loops
of
duct
tape
and
twine
hanging
from
his
captain
chair
dried
strings
of
skin
like
desiccated
banana
peel
fibers
hanging
from
them
he
swore
to
himself
quietly
and
shouted
shit
at
the
low
basement
ceiling
he
could
have
been
asleep
for
more
than
a
few
seconds
and
the
that
davey
had
escaped
through
gaped
open
at
him
like
a
sneer
he
tottered
to
his
feet
and
went
out
to
find
kurt
bare
feet
jammed
into
sneakers
bare
chest
and
bandages
covered
up
with
a
jacket
he
found
kurt
cutting
through
the
park
dragging
his
heels
in
the
bloody
dawn
light
kurt
looked
at
his
expression
then
said
what
happened
he
had
his
fists
at
his
sides
he
looked
tensed
to
run
alan
felt
that
he
was
waiting
for
an
order
he
got
away
how
alan
shook
his
head
can
you
help
me
get
dressed
i
do
think
i
can
get
a
shirt
on
by
myself
they
went
to
the
greek
waiting
out
front
on
the
curb
for
the
old
man
to
show
up
and
unchain
the
chairs
and
drag
them
out
around
the
table
he
served
them
tall
coffees
and
omelets
sleepily
and
they
ate
in
silence
too
tired
to
talk
let
me
take
you
to
the
doctor
kurt
asked
nodding
at
the
bandage
that
bulged
under
his
shirt
no
alan
said
i
a
fast
healer
kurt
rubbed
at
his
calf
and
winced
he
broke
the
skin
he
said
you
got
all
your
shots
hell
yeah
too
much
crap
in
the
dumpsters
i
once
found
a
styro
cooler
of
smashed
blood
vials
in
a
red
cross
trash
you
be
okay
then
alan
said
he
shifted
in
his
seat
and
winced
he
grunted
a
little
ouch
kurt
narrowed
his
eyes
and
shook
his
head
at
him
this
is
pretty
fucked
up
right
here
kurt
said
looking
down
into
his
coffee
it
only
a
little
less
weird
for
me
if
that
any
comfort
it
not
kurt
said
well
that
why
i
do
usually
tell
others
you
only
the
second
person
to
believe
it
maybe
i
could
meet
up
with
the
first
and
form
a
support
group
alan
pushed
his
omelet
away
you
ca
she
dead
davey
haunted
the
schoolyard
alan
had
always
treated
the
school
and
its
grounds
as
a
safe
haven
a
place
where
he
could
get
away
from
the
inexplicable
a
place
where
he
could
play
at
being
normal
but
now
davey
was
everywhere
lurking
in
the
climber
hiding
in
the
trees
peering
through
the
windows
during
class
alan
only
caught
the
quickest
glimpses
of
him
but
he
had
the
sense
that
if
he
turned
his
head
around
quickly
enough
he
see
him
davey
made
himself
scarce
in
the
mountain
hiding
in
the
golems
cave
or
one
of
the
deep
tunnels
marci
did
come
to
class
after
monday
alan
fretted
every
morning
waiting
for
her
to
turn
up
he
worried
that
she
told
her
father
or
that
she
was
at
home
sulking
too
angry
to
come
to
school
glaring
at
her
christmas
tree
davey
grin
was
everywhere
on
wednesday
he
got
called
into
the
vice
principal
office
as
he
neared
it
he
heard
the
rumble
of
marci
father
thick
voice
and
his
heart
began
to
pound
in
his
chest
he
cracked
the
door
and
put
his
face
in
the
gap
looking
at
the
two
men
there
davenport
the
vice
principal
with
his
gray
hair
growing
out
his
large
ears
and
cavernous
nostrils
sitting
behind
his
desk
looking
awkwardly
at
marci
father
eyes
bugged
and
bagged
and
bloodshot
face
turned
to
the
ground
looking
like
a
different
man
the
picture
of
worry
and
loss
davenport
saw
him
and
crooked
a
finger
at
him
looking
stern
and
stony
alan
was
sure
then
that
marci
told
it
all
to
her
father
who
told
it
all
to
davenport
who
would
tell
the
world
and
suddenly
he
was
jealous
of
his
secret
could
bear
to
have
it
revealed
could
bear
the
thought
of
men
coming
to
the
mountain
to
catalogue
it
for
the
subject
index
at
the
library
to
study
him
and
take
him
apart
and
he
was
afraid
not
of
what
they
all
do
to
him
what
davey
would
do
to
them
he
knew
suddenly
that
davey
would
not
abide
their
secrets
being
disclosed
he
forced
himself
forward
his
feet
dragging
like
millstones
and
stood
between
the
two
men
hands
in
his
pockets
nervously
twining
at
his
underwear
alan
marci
father
croaked
davenport
held
up
a
hand
to
silence
him
alan
davenport
said
have
you
seen
marci
alan
had
been
prepared
to
deny
everything
call
marci
a
liar
betray
her
as
she
betrayed
him
make
it
her
word
against
his
protect
her
protect
her
father
and
the
school
and
the
town
from
what
davey
would
do
now
he
whipped
his
head
toward
marci
father
suddenly
understanding
no
he
said
not
all
week
is
she
all
right
marci
father
sobbed
a
sound
alan
had
never
heard
an
adult
make
and
it
came
tumbling
out
no
one
had
seen
marci
since
sunday
night
her
presumed
whereabouts
had
moved
from
a
friend
place
to
alan
place
to
runaway
to
fallen
in
a
lake
to
hit
by
a
car
and
motionless
in
a
ditch
and
if
alan
had
seen
her
i
have
alan
said
not
since
the
weekend
sunday
morning
she
said
she
was
going
home
another
new
sound
the
sound
of
an
adult
crying
marci
father
and
his
sobs
made
his
chest
shake
and
davenport
awkwardly
came
from
behind
his
desk
and
set
a
box
of
kleenexes
on
the
hard
bench
beside
him
alan
caught
davenport
eye
and
the
vice
principal
made
a
shoo
and
pointed
at
the
door
alan
did
bother
going
back
to
class
he
went
straight
to
the
cave
straight
to
where
he
knew
davey
would
be
must
be
hiding
and
found
him
there
playing
with
the
bones
that
lined
the
walls
where
is
she
alan
said
after
he
taken
hold
of
davey
hair
and
without
fanfare
smashed
his
face
into
the
cold
stone
floor
hard
enough
to
break
his
nose
alan
twisted
his
wrists
behind
his
back
and
when
he
tried
to
get
up
alan
kicked
his
legs
out
from
under
him
wrenching
his
arms
in
their
sockets
he
heard
a
popping
sound
where
is
she
alan
said
again
amazing
himself
with
his
own
calmness
davey
was
crying
now
genuinely
scared
it
seemed
and
alan
reveled
in
the
feeling
i
kill
you
he
whispered
in
davey
ear
almost
lovingly
i
kill
you
and
put
the
body
where
no
one
will
find
it
unless
you
tell
me
where
she
is
davey
spat
out
a
milk
tooth
his
right
top
incisor
and
cried
around
the
blood
that
coursed
down
his
face
i
i
alan
he
said
but
it
was
the
his
sobs
were
louder
and
harsher
than
marci
father
had
been
where
is
she
alan
said
knowing
with
caleb
davey
said
i
buried
her
in
caleb
he
found
his
brother
the
island
midway
down
the
mountain
sliding
under
cover
of
winter
for
the
seaway
he
climbed
the
island
slope
making
for
the
ring
of
footprints
in
the
snow
the
snow
peppered
brown
with
soil
and
green
with
grass
and
he
dug
with
his
hands
like
a
dog
tossing
snow
soil
grass
through
his
legs
digging
to
loose
soil
digging
to
a
cold
hand
a
cold
hand
protruding
from
the
snow
now
from
the
soil
some
of
the
snow
with
blood
a
skinny
freckled
hand
a
fingernail
missing
torn
off
leaving
behind
an
impression
an
inverse
fingernail
a
hand
an
arm
not
attached
to
anything
he
set
it
to
one
side
dug
found
another
hand
another
arm
a
leg
a
head
she
was
beaten
bruised
eyes
swollen
and
two
teeth
missing
ear
torn
hair
caked
with
blood
her
beautiful
head
fell
from
his
shaking
cold
hands
he
did
want
to
dig
anymore
but
he
had
to
because
it
was
the
secret
and
it
had
to
be
kept
and
he
buried
her
in
caleb
piled
dirt
grass
snow
on
her
parts
and
his
eyes
were
dry
and
he
did
sob
it
was
a
long
autumn
and
a
long
winter
and
a
long
spring
that
year
unwiring
the
market
alan
fell
into
the
familiar
rhythm
of
the
work
of
a
new
venture
rising
early
dossing
late
always
doing
two
or
three
things
at
once
setting
up
meetings
merchants
debugging
his
process
on
the
fly
his
first
victory
came
from
the
greek
who
was
no
pushover
the
man
was
over
seventy
and
had
been
pouring
lethal
coffee
and
cheap
beer
down
the
throats
of
kensington
hipsters
for
decades
and
had
steadfastly
refused
every
single
crackpot
scheme
hatched
by
his
customers
larry
andy
said
i
have
a
proposal
for
you
and
you
going
to
hate
it
i
hate
it
already
the
greek
said
his
dapper
little
mustache
twitched
it
was
not
even
seven
yet
and
the
greek
was
tinkering
with
the
guts
of
his
espresso
delivery
system
making
it
emit
loud
hisses
and
tossing
out
evil
congealed
masses
of
coffee
grounds
what
if
i
told
you
it
would
cost
you
anything
maybe
i
hate
it
a
little
less
here
the
pitch
alan
said
taking
a
sip
of
the
thick
steaming
coffee
the
greek
handed
to
him
in
a
minuscule
cup
he
shivered
as
the
stuff
coated
his
tongue
wow
the
greek
gave
him
half
a
smile
which
was
his
version
of
roaring
hilarity
here
the
pitch
me
and
that
punk
kid
kurt
we
working
on
a
community
internet
project
for
the
market
computers
the
greek
said
yup
alan
said
pah
the
greek
said
anders
nodded
i
knew
you
were
going
to
say
that
but
do
think
of
this
as
a
computer
thing
okay
think
of
this
as
a
free
speech
thing
we
putting
in
a
system
to
allow
people
all
over
the
market
and
someday
maybe
the
whole
city
to
communicate
for
free
in
private
without
permission
from
anyone
they
can
send
messages
they
can
get
information
about
the
world
they
can
have
conversations
like
a
library
and
a
telephone
and
a
all
at
once
larry
poured
himself
a
coffee
i
hate
when
they
come
in
here
with
computers
they
sit
forever
at
their
tables
and
they
do
talk
to
nobody
it
like
having
a
place
full
of
statues
or
zombies
well
alan
said
if
you
all
alone
with
a
computer
just
going
to
fall
down
the
rabbit
hole
you
in
your
own
world
and
cut
off
from
the
rest
of
the
world
but
once
you
put
those
computers
on
the
network
they
become
a
way
to
talk
to
anyone
else
in
the
world
for
free
you
help
us
with
this
network
all
we
want
from
you
is
permission
to
stick
up
a
box
over
your
sign
and
patch
it
into
your
power
you
wo
even
know
it
there
and
those
customers
wo
be
antisocial
they
be
socializing
over
the
network
you
think
that
what
they
do
if
i
help
them
with
the
network
he
started
to
say
but
bit
it
back
because
bullshit
antennae
were
visibly
twitching
no
but
some
of
them
will
you
see
them
in
here
talking
typing
typing
talking
how
it
goes
the
point
is
that
we
do
know
how
people
are
going
to
use
this
network
yet
but
we
know
that
it
a
social
benefit
you
want
to
use
my
electricity
well
yeah
so
it
not
free
not
entirely
alan
said
you
got
me
there
aha
the
greek
said
look
if
that
a
deal
breaker
i
personally
come
by
every
day
and
give
you
a
dollar
for
the
juice
come
on
larry
the
box
we
want
to
put
in
it
just
a
repeater
to
extend
the
range
of
the
network
the
network
already
reaches
to
here
but
your
box
will
help
it
go
farther
you
be
the
first
merchant
in
the
market
to
have
one
i
came
to
you
first
because
you
been
here
the
longest
the
others
look
up
to
you
they
see
it
and
say
has
one
it
must
be
all
right
the
greek
downed
his
coffee
and
smoothed
his
mustache
you
are
a
bullshit
artist
huh
all
right
you
put
your
box
in
if
my
electricity
bills
are
too
high
though
i
take
it
down
that
a
deal
andy
said
how
about
i
do
it
this
morning
before
you
get
busy
wo
take
more
than
a
couple
minutes
the
greek
was
midway
between
his
place
and
kurt
and
kurt
hardly
stirred
when
he
let
himself
in
to
get
an
access
point
from
one
of
the
chipped
shelving
units
before
going
back
to
his
place
to
get
his
ladder
and
makita
drill
it
took
him
most
of
the
morning
to
get
it
securely
fastened
over
the
sign
screws
sunk
deep
enough
into
the
old
spongy
wood
to
survive
the
build
up
of
ice
and
snow
that
would
come
with
the
winter
then
he
had
to
wire
it
into
the
sign
which
took
longer
than
he
thought
it
would
too
but
then
it
was
done
and
the
idiot
lights
started
blinking
on
the
box
kurt
had
assembled
and
what
exactly
are
you
doing
up
there
al
kurt
said
when
he
finally
stumbled
out
of
bed
and
down
the
road
for
his
afternoon
breakfast
coffee
larry
letting
us
put
up
an
access
point
he
said
wiping
the
pigeon
shit
off
a
wire
preparatory
to
taping
it
down
he
descended
the
ladder
and
wiped
his
hands
off
on
his
painter
pants
that
be
ten
bucks
please
kurt
dug
out
a
handful
of
coins
and
picked
out
enough
loonies
and
toonies
to
make
ten
dollars
and
handed
it
over
you
talked
the
greek
into
it
he
hissed
how
i
kissed
his
ass
without
insulting
his
intelligence
neat
trick
kurt
said
and
they
had
a
little
i
better
login
to
that
thing
and
get
it
onto
the
network
huh
yeah
anders
said
i
gon
na
order
some
lunch
lem
me
get
you
something
what
they
had
done
was
they
had
hacked
the
shit
out
of
those
boxes
that
kurt
had
built
in
his
junkyard
of
a
storefront
of
an
apartment
these
work
alan
said
he
had
three
of
them
in
a
big
catering
tub
from
his
basement
that
he
sluiced
clean
the
base
stations
no
longer
looked
like
they
been
built
out
of
garbage
they
switched
to
motherboards
that
let
them
shrink
the
hardware
down
to
small
enough
to
fit
in
a
junction
box
from
canadian
tire
adam
vaguely
recognized
the
day
as
regulars
who
been
hanging
around
the
shop
for
some
time
and
they
gave
him
the
hairy
eyeball
when
he
had
the
audacity
to
question
kurt
these
kids
of
were
much
like
the
kids
he
had
working
for
him
over
the
years
they
might
be
bright
but
they
were
a
lot
angrier
some
of
the
girls
were
cutters
with
knife
scars
on
their
forearms
some
of
the
boys
looked
like
they
been
beaten
up
a
few
times
too
many
on
the
streets
like
they
were
spoiling
for
a
fight
alan
tried
to
unfocus
his
eyes
when
he
was
in
the
front
of
kurt
shop
to
not
see
any
of
them
too
closely
they
work
kurt
said
he
smelled
terrible
a
combination
of
garbage
and
sweat
and
he
had
the
jitters
he
got
when
he
stayed
up
all
night
i
tested
them
twice
you
built
me
a
spare
alan
said
examining
the
neat
lines
of
hot
glue
that
gasketed
the
sturdy
rubberized
antennae
in
place
masking
the
slightly
melted
edges
left
behind
by
the
drill
press
you
do
need
a
spare
kurt
said
alan
knew
that
when
he
got
touchy
like
this
he
had
to
be
very
careful
or
he
blow
up
but
he
going
to
do
another
demo
kurt
way
they
done
exactly
one
of
those
at
a
toronto
district
school
board
superintendents
meeting
when
alan
had
gotten
the
idea
of
using
schools
flagpoles
and
backhaul
as
test
beds
for
building
out
the
net
it
had
been
a
debacle
needless
to
say
two
of
the
access
points
had
been
permanently
installed
on
either
end
of
kurt
storefront
and
the
third
had
been
in
storage
for
a
month
since
it
was
last
tested
one
of
the
street
kids
a
boy
with
a
pair
of
improbably
enormous
raver
shoes
looked
up
at
alan
we
tested
these
all
they
work
kurt
puffed
up
and
gratefully
socked
the
kid
in
the
shoulder
we
did
fine
adam
said
patiently
but
can
we
make
sure
they
work
now
they
work
kurt
had
said
when
alan
told
him
that
he
wanted
to
test
the
access
points
out
before
they
took
them
to
the
meeting
practically
they
running
off
the
standard
distribution
there
almost
no
configuration
which
may
or
may
not
have
been
true
it
certainly
sounded
plausible
to
alan
lay
ear
but
it
did
change
the
fact
that
once
they
powered
up
the
third
box
the
other
two
seized
up
and
died
the
blinking
network
lights
fell
still
and
as
kurt
hauled
out
an
old
terminal
and
plugged
it
into
the
serial
ports
on
the
backs
of
his
big
ugly
bestickered
and
pc
cases
it
became
apparent
that
they
had
ceased
to
honor
all
requests
for
routing
association
deassociation
dhcp
leases
and
the
myriad
of
other
networking
services
provided
for
by
the
software
it
practically
kurt
said
nearly
after
powered
down
the
third
box
and
found
that
the
other
two
previously
routing
and
humming
along
happily
refused
to
come
back
up
into
their
state
he
gave
alan
a
dirty
look
as
though
his
insistence
on
preflighting
were
the
root
of
their
problems
the
who
spoken
up
had
jumped
when
kurt
raised
his
voice
then
cringed
away
now
as
kurt
began
to
tear
around
the
shop
looking
through
boxes
of
cds
and
dropping
things
on
the
floor
the
kid
all
but
cowered
and
the
other
three
all
looked
down
at
the
table
i
just
reinstall
kurt
said
that
the
beauty
of
these
things
it
a
standard
distro
i
just
copy
it
over
and
come
right
back
up
no
problem
take
me
ten
minutes
we
got
plenty
of
time
then
five
minutes
later
shit
i
forgot
that
this
one
has
a
different
than
the
others
alan
said
amused
he
spotted
the
signs
of
something
very
finicky
gone
very
wrong
and
he
given
up
any
hope
of
actually
doing
the
demo
so
he
settled
in
to
watch
the
process
without
rancor
and
to
learn
as
much
as
he
could
motherboard
kurt
said
reaching
for
a
spool
of
blank
cds
just
got
to
patch
the
distribution
recompile
burn
it
to
cd
and
reboot
and
we
on
the
road
ten
minutes
later
shit
yes
alan
said
back
off
okay
i
going
to
call
them
and
let
them
know
we
going
to
be
late
we
going
to
be
late
kurt
said
his
fingers
going
into
claws
on
the
keyboard
we
already
late
alan
said
shit
kurt
said
let
do
this
alan
said
let
bring
down
the
two
that
you
got
working
and
show
them
those
and
explain
the
rest
they
had
a
fight
and
kurt
had
insisted
as
alan
had
suspected
he
would
that
he
was
only
a
minute
or
two
away
from
bringing
everything
back
online
alan
kept
his
cool
made
mental
notes
of
the
things
that
went
wrong
and
put
together
a
plan
for
avoiding
all
these
problems
the
next
time
around
is
there
a
spare
alan
said
kurt
sneered
and
jerked
a
thumb
at
his
workbench
where
another
junction
box
sat
antennae
poking
out
of
it
alan
moved
it
into
his
tub
great
he
said
tested
right
all
permutations
tested
and
ready
to
go
you
know
you
not
the
boss
around
here
i
know
it
he
said
partners
he
clapped
kurt
on
the
shoulder
ignoring
the
damp
gray
grimy
feeling
of
the
clammy
under
his
palm
the
shoulder
under
his
palm
sagged
right
kurt
said
sorry
do
be
alan
said
you
been
hard
at
it
i
get
loaded
while
you
wash
up
kurt
sniffed
at
his
armpit
whew
he
said
yeah
okay
when
kurt
emerged
from
the
front
door
of
his
storefront
ten
minutes
later
he
looked
like
he
at
least
made
an
effort
his
mohawk
and
its
fins
were
slicked
back
and
tucked
under
a
baseball
hat
his
black
jeans
were
unripped
and
had
only
one
conservative
chain
joining
the
wallet
in
his
back
pocket
to
his
belt
loop
throw
in
a
clean
advertising
an
old
technology
conference
instead
of
the
customary
old
hardcore
band
and
you
had
an
approximation
of
the
kind
of
geek
that
everyone
knew
was
in
possession
of
secret
knowledge
and
hence
must
be
treated
with
attention
if
not
respect
i
feel
like
such
a
dilbert
he
said
you
look
totally
disreputable
alan
said
hefting
the
tub
of
their
access
points
into
the
bed
of
his
truck
and
pulling
the
bungees
tight
around
it
punk
as
fuck
kurt
grinned
and
ducked
his
head
stop
it
he
said
flatterer
get
in
the
truck
alan
said
kurt
drummed
his
fingers
nervously
on
his
palms
the
whole
way
to
bell
offices
alan
grabbed
his
hand
and
stilled
it
stop
worrying
he
said
this
is
going
to
go
great
i
still
do
understand
why
we
doing
this
kurt
said
they
the
phone
company
they
hate
us
we
hate
them
ca
we
just
leave
it
that
way
do
worry
we
still
all
hate
each
other
when
we
get
done
so
why
bother
he
sounded
petulant
and
groggy
and
alan
reached
under
his
seat
for
the
thermos
he
had
filled
at
the
greek
before
heading
to
kurt
place
coffee
he
said
and
handed
it
to
kurt
who
groaned
and
swigged
and
stopped
bitching
why
bother
is
this
alan
said
we
going
to
get
a
lot
of
publicity
for
doing
this
kurt
snorted
into
the
thermos
it
going
to
be
a
big
deal
you
know
how
big
a
deal
this
can
be
we
going
to
communicate
that
to
the
press
who
will
communicate
it
to
the
public
and
then
there
will
be
a
shitstorm
radio
cops
telco
people
whatever
they
going
to
try
to
discredit
us
i
want
to
know
what
they
liable
to
say
christ
you
dragging
me
out
for
that
i
can
tell
you
what
say
they
drag
out
the
four
horsemen
of
the
infocalypse
kiddie
porn
terrorists
pirates
and
the
mafia
they
tell
us
that
any
tool
for
communicating
that
they
ca
tap
log
and
switch
off
is
irresponsible
they
tell
us
we
stealing
from
isps
it
what
they
say
every
time
someone
tries
this
philly
new
york
london
all
around
the
world
same
song
alan
nodded
that
good
background
thanks
i
still
want
to
know
they
say
it
what
the
flaws
are
in
their
expression
of
their
argument
and
i
wanted
us
to
run
a
demo
for
some
people
who
we
could
never
hope
to
sway
that
a
good
audience
for
exposing
the
flaws
in
the
show
this
be
a
good
prep
session
so
i
pulled
an
and
busted
my
nuts
to
produce
a
demo
for
a
bunch
of
people
we
do
care
about
thanks
a
lot
alan
started
to
say
something
equally
bitchy
back
and
then
he
stopped
himself
he
knew
where
this
would
end
up
a
screaming
match
that
would
leave
both
of
them
emotionally
overwrought
at
a
time
when
they
needed
cool
heads
but
he
could
think
of
what
to
tell
kurt
in
order
to
placate
him
all
his
life
he
been
in
situations
like
this
confronted
by
people
who
had
some
beef
some
grievance
and
he
had
no
answer
for
it
usually
he
could
puzzle
out
the
skeleton
of
their
cause
but
sometimes
times
like
this
he
was
stumped
he
picked
at
the
phrase
pulled
an
kurt
pulled
an
because
he
left
this
to
the
last
minute
not
because
alan
had
surprised
him
with
it
he
knew
that
of
course
was
waiting
then
for
alan
to
bust
him
on
it
to
tell
him
is
your
fault
not
mine
to
tell
him
this
demo
fails
it
because
you
fucked
off
and
left
it
to
the
last
minute
so
he
was
angry
but
not
at
alan
he
was
angry
at
himself
bunch
of
people
we
do
care
about
what
was
that
about
ah
kurt
knew
that
they
did
take
him
seriously
in
the
real
world
he
was
too
dirty
too
too
much
of
his
identity
was
wrapped
up
in
being
alienated
and
alienating
but
he
could
make
his
dream
come
true
without
alan
help
either
and
so
alan
was
the
friendly
face
on
their
enterprise
and
he
resented
that
feared
that
in
order
to
keep
up
his
appearance
of
he
have
to
go
into
the
meeting
cursing
and
sneering
and
that
alan
would
bust
him
on
that
too
alan
frowned
at
the
steering
wheel
he
was
getting
better
at
understanding
people
but
that
did
make
him
necessarily
better
at
being
a
person
what
should
he
say
here
that
was
a
really
heroic
effort
kurt
he
said
biting
his
lip
i
can
tell
you
put
a
lot
of
work
into
it
he
could
believe
that
praise
this
naked
could
possibly
placate
someone
of
kurt
heroic
cynicism
but
kurt
features
softened
and
he
turned
his
face
away
rolled
down
the
window
lit
a
cigarette
i
thought
i
never
get
it
done
kurt
said
i
was
so
sleepy
i
felt
like
i
was
could
concentrate
were
up
all
night
because
you
left
it
to
the
last
alan
thought
but
kurt
knew
that
was
waiting
to
be
reassured
about
it
i
do
know
how
you
get
as
much
done
as
you
do
must
be
really
hard
it
not
so
bad
kurt
said
dragging
on
his
cigarette
and
not
quite
disguising
his
grin
it
gets
easier
every
time
yeah
we
going
to
get
this
down
to
a
science
someday
alan
said
something
we
can
teach
anyone
to
do
that
would
be
so
cool
kurt
said
and
put
his
boots
up
on
the
dash
god
you
could
pick
all
the
parts
you
needed
out
of
the
trash
throw
a
little
methodology
at
them
and
out
would
pop
this
thing
that
destroyed
the
phone
company
this
is
going
to
be
a
fun
meeting
alan
said
shit
yeah
they
going
to
be
terrified
of
us
someday
maybe
it
starts
today
the
bell
boardroom
looked
more
like
a
retail
operation
than
a
back
office
decked
out
in
livery
from
the
rag
carpets
to
the
lighting
fixtures
they
were
given
espressos
by
the
young
whose
number
was
some
kind
of
reinterpreted
ravewear
outfit
toned
down
for
a
corporate
workplace
so
this
is
the
new
bell
kurt
said
once
she
had
gone
our
tax
dollars
at
work
this
is
good
work
alan
said
gesturing
at
the
artwork
of
models
who
were
but
not
on
the
walls
the
bell
redesign
had
come
at
the
same
time
as
the
telco
was
struggling
back
from
the
brink
of
bankruptcy
and
the
marketing
firm
they
hired
to
do
the
work
had
made
its
name
on
the
strength
of
the
campaign
makes
you
feel
like
using
a
phone
is
a
really
futuristic
activity
he
said
his
contact
at
the
semiprivatized
corporation
was
a
young
kid
who
shopped
at
one
of
his
designer
furniture
store
he
was
a
young
turk
who
made
a
name
for
himself
quickly
in
the
company
through
a
couple
of
isp
acquisitions
at
prices
after
the
which
he
executed
flawlessly
integrating
the
companies
into
bell
network
with
hardly
a
hiccup
he
been
very
polite
and
guardedly
enthusiastic
when
alan
called
him
and
had
invited
him
down
to
meet
some
of
his
colleagues
though
alan
had
never
met
him
he
recognized
him
the
minute
he
walked
in
as
the
person
who
had
to
go
with
the
confident
voice
he
heard
on
the
phone
lyman
he
said
standing
up
and
holding
out
his
hand
the
guy
was
slightly
tall
with
a
sharp
suit
that
managed
to
look
casual
and
expensive
at
the
same
time
he
shook
alan
hand
and
said
thanks
for
coming
down
alan
introduced
him
to
kurt
and
then
lyman
introduced
them
both
to
his
colleagues
a
posse
of
young
people
along
with
one
graybeard
literally
he
had
a
unix
beard
of
great
rattiness
and
gravitas
who
had
no
fewer
than
seven
devices
on
his
belt
including
a
line
tester
and
a
gps
once
they
were
seated
alan
snuck
a
look
at
kurt
who
had
narrowed
his
eyes
and
cast
his
gaze
down
onto
the
business
cards
he
been
handed
alan
had
been
expecting
this
he
figured
on
finding
himself
facing
down
a
group
of
career
bureaucrats
and
kurt
was
clearly
thrown
for
a
loop
too
well
alan
kurt
it
nice
to
meet
you
lyman
said
i
hear
working
on
some
exciting
stuff
we
are
alan
said
we
building
a
mesh
wireless
network
using
unlicensed
spectrum
that
will
provide
internet
connectivity
absolutely
gratis
that
ambitious
lyman
said
without
the
skepticism
that
alan
had
assumed
would
greet
his
statement
how
it
coming
well
we
got
a
bunch
of
kensington
market
covered
alan
said
kurt
been
improving
the
hardware
design
and
we
come
up
with
something
cheap
and
reproducible
he
opened
his
tub
and
handed
out
the
access
points
housed
in
gray
plastic
junction
boxes
lyman
accepted
one
solemnly
and
passed
it
on
to
his
graybeard
then
passed
the
next
to
an
east
indian
woman
in
glasses
whose
fingernails
immediately
popped
the
latch
and
began
lightly
stroking
the
hardware
inside
tracing
the
connections
the
third
landed
in
front
of
lyman
himself
so
what
do
they
do
alan
nodded
at
kurt
kurt
put
his
hands
on
the
table
and
took
a
breath
they
got
three
network
interfaces
we
can
do
any
combination
of
wired
and
wireless
cards
the
os
is
loaded
on
a
it
any
wireless
cards
and
them
to
seek
out
other
access
points
when
it
finds
a
peer
they
negotiate
a
relationship
based
on
current
load
and
the
client
then
associates
with
the
server
there
a
key
exchange
that
we
use
to
make
sure
that
rogue
aps
do
sneak
into
the
mesh
and
a
routine
we
use
to
switch
routes
if
the
connection
drops
or
we
start
to
see
too
much
packet
loss
the
graybeard
looked
up
it
izz
a
radio
vor
talking
to
gott
he
said
lyman
posse
laughed
and
after
a
second
so
did
kurt
alan
must
have
looked
puzzled
for
kurt
elbowed
him
in
the
ribs
and
said
it
from
indiana
jones
he
said
ha
alan
said
that
movie
had
come
out
long
before
he
come
to
the
city
he
had
seen
a
movie
until
he
was
almost
as
was
often
the
case
the
reference
to
a
film
made
him
feel
like
a
martian
the
graybeard
passed
his
unit
on
to
the
others
at
the
table
does
it
work
he
said
yeah
kurt
said
well
that
pretty
cool
he
said
kurt
blushed
i
did
write
the
firmware
he
said
just
stuck
it
together
from
parts
of
other
peoples
projects
so
what
the
plan
lyman
said
how
many
of
these
are
you
going
to
need
hundreds
eventually
alan
said
but
for
starters
we
be
happy
if
we
can
get
enough
to
shoot
down
to
front
you
going
to
try
to
peer
with
someone
there
the
east
indian
woman
had
plugged
the
ap
into
a
riser
under
the
boardroom
table
and
was
examining
its
blinkenlights
yeah
alan
said
that
the
general
idea
he
was
getting
a
little
uncomfortable
these
people
were
nearly
hostile
enough
to
their
ideas
well
that
very
ambitious
lyman
said
his
posse
all
nodded
as
though
he
paid
them
a
compliment
though
alan
was
sure
ambitious
could
certainly
be
code
for
ridiculous
how
about
a
demo
the
east
indian
woman
said
course
kurt
said
he
dug
out
his
laptop
a
battered
thing
held
together
with
band
stickers
and
gaffer
tape
and
plugged
in
a
wireless
card
the
others
started
to
pass
him
back
his
access
points
but
he
shook
his
head
just
plug
in
he
said
here
or
in
another
room
nearby
that
be
cooler
a
couple
of
the
younger
people
at
the
table
picked
up
two
of
the
aps
and
headed
for
the
hallway
put
one
on
my
desk
lyman
told
them
and
the
other
at
reception
alan
felt
a
sudden
prickle
at
the
back
of
his
neck
though
he
know
why
just
a
random
premonition
that
they
were
on
the
brink
of
something
very
bad
happening
this
was
the
kind
of
vision
that
brad
would
experience
that
far
away
look
followed
by
a
into
the
now
eyes
filled
with
certitude
about
the
dreadful
future
more
like
a
goose
walking
over
his
grave
a
tickle
of
badness
the
east
indian
woman
passed
kurt
a
vga
cable
that
snaked
into
the
table
guts
and
down
into
the
riser
on
the
floor
she
hit
a
button
on
a
remote
and
an
lcd
projector
mounted
in
the
ceiling
began
to
hum
projecting
a
rectangle
of
white
light
on
one
wall
kurt
wiggled
it
into
the
backside
of
his
computer
and
spun
down
the
thumbscrews
hit
a
button
and
then
his
desktop
was
up
on
the
wall
ten
feet
high
his
wallpaper
was
a
picture
of
a
group
of
kerchiefed
protesters
charging
a
police
line
of
batons
and
a
closer
look
revealed
that
the
protester
running
in
the
lead
was
probably
kurt
he
tapped
at
his
touchpad
and
a
window
came
up
showing
relative
strength
signals
for
two
of
the
access
points
a
moment
later
the
third
came
online
i
been
working
with
this
network
visualizer
app
kurt
said
it
tries
to
draw
logical
maps
of
the
network
topology
with
false
coloring
denoting
packet
loss
between
hops
that
a
pretty
good
proxy
for
distance
between
two
aps
more
like
the
fade
the
graybeard
said
fade
is
a
function
of
distance
kurt
said
alan
heard
the
dismissal
in
his
voice
and
knew
they
were
getting
into
a
match
fade
is
a
function
of
geography
and
topology
the
graybeard
said
quietly
kurt
waved
his
hand
whatever
sure
geography
topology
distance
it
a
floor
wax
and
a
dessert
topping
i
not
being
pedantic
the
graybeard
said
you
not
just
being
pedantic
lyman
said
gently
watching
the
screen
on
which
four
animated
jaggy
boxes
were
jumbling
and
dancing
as
they
reported
on
the
throughput
between
the
routers
and
the
laptop
not
just
pedantic
the
graybeard
said
if
you
have
a
of
these
boxes
in
known
locations
with
known
nominal
throughput
you
can
use
them
as
a
kind
of
sensor
array
when
throughput
drops
between
point
foo
and
point
bar
it
will
tell
you
something
about
the
physical
world
between
foo
and
bar
kurt
looked
up
from
his
screen
with
a
thoughtful
look
huh
like
whether
a
tree
had
lost
its
leaves
in
the
night
or
whether
there
were
a
lot
of
people
standing
around
in
a
normally
desolate
area
or
whether
there
are
lots
of
devices
operating
between
foo
and
bar
that
are
interfering
with
them
kurt
nodded
slowly
the
packets
we
lose
could
be
just
as
interesting
as
the
packets
we
do
lose
he
said
a
light
went
on
in
alan
head
we
could
be
like
jazz
critics
listening
to
the
silences
instead
of
the
notes
he
said
they
all
looked
at
him
that
very
good
lyman
said
like
a
jazz
critic
he
smiled
alan
smiled
back
what
are
we
seeing
craig
lyman
said
kurt
alan
said
right
kurt
he
said
sorry
we
seeing
the
grid
here
see
how
the
access
points
go
further
up
the
spectrum
the
more
packets
they
get
i
associated
with
that
bad
boy
right
there
he
gestured
to
the
box
blinking
silently
in
the
middle
of
the
board
room
table
and
it
connected
to
one
other
which
is
connected
to
a
third
lyman
picked
up
his
phone
and
dialed
a
number
hey
can
you
unplug
the
box
on
my
desk
a
moment
later
one
of
the
boxes
on
the
display
winked
out
watch
this
kurt
said
as
the
remaining
two
boxes
were
joined
by
a
coruscating
line
see
that
minimal
packet
loss
beautiful
that
hot
lyman
said
that
makes
me
all
wet
they
chuckled
nervously
at
his
crudity
seriously
here
kurt
said
and
another
window
popped
up
showing
twenty
or
more
boxes
with
marching
ant
trails
between
them
that
a
of
the
kensington
network
the
boxes
are
running
different
versions
of
the
firmware
so
you
can
see
that
in
some
edge
cases
you
get
a
lot
more
oscillation
between
two
similar
signals
we
fixed
that
in
the
new
version
the
graybeard
said
how
we
flip
a
coin
kurt
said
and
grinned
these
guys
in
denmark
ran
some
simulations
proved
that
a
random
worked
as
well
as
any
other
algorithm
and
it
a
lot
cheaper
computationally
so
what
going
on
just
to
the
northeast
of
center
alan
paid
attention
to
the
patch
of
screen
indicated
three
access
points
were
playing
musical
chairs
dropping
signal
and
reacquiring
it
dropping
it
again
kurt
shrugged
bum
hardware
i
think
we
got
volunteers
assembling
those
boxes
from
parts
parts
kurt
grin
widened
yeah
from
the
trash
mostly
i
for
they
grinned
back
that
very
hot
lyman
said
we
looking
at
normalizing
the
parts
for
the
next
revision
alan
said
we
want
to
be
able
to
use
a
single
distro
that
works
on
all
of
them
oh
sure
lyman
said
but
he
looked
a
little
disappointed
and
so
did
kurt
okay
it
works
lyman
said
it
works
he
said
nodding
the
question
at
his
posse
they
nodded
back
so
what
can
we
do
for
you
alan
chewed
his
lip
caught
himself
at
it
stopped
he
anticipated
a
slugfest
now
he
was
getting
strokes
how
come
you
being
so
nice
to
us
kurt
said
you
guys
are
the
man
he
shrugged
at
alan
someone
had
to
say
it
lyman
smiled
yeah
we
the
phone
company
big
lumbering
dinosaur
that
is
thrashing
in
the
tarpit
the
spazz
dinosaur
that
so
embarrassed
all
the
other
dinosaurs
that
none
of
them
want
to
rescue
us
heh
spazz
dinosaur
the
east
indian
woman
said
and
they
all
laughed
heh
kurt
said
but
seriously
seriously
lyman
said
seriously
think
a
second
about
the
scale
of
a
telco
of
this
telco
the
thousands
of
kilometers
of
wire
in
the
ground
switching
stations
skilled
linesmen
and
coders
switches
backhaul
peering
arrangements
got
it
all
ever
get
on
a
highway
and
hit
a
flat
patch
where
you
see
anything
to
the
horizon
except
the
road
and
the
telephone
poles
and
the
wires
those
are
it
a
lot
of
goodness
especially
for
a
big
evil
phone
company
so
we
got
a
lot
of
smart
hackers
a
lot
of
cool
toys
a
gigantic
budget
the
biggest
network
any
of
us
could
ever
hope
to
manage
like
a
model
train
set
the
size
of
a
city
that
said
we
hardly
nimble
moving
a
bell
is
like
shifting
a
battleship
by
tapping
it
on
the
nose
with
a
toothpick
it
can
be
done
but
you
can
spend
ten
years
doing
it
and
still
not
be
sure
if
made
any
progress
from
the
outside
it
easy
to
mistake
for
it
easy
to
make
that
mistake
from
the
inside
too
but
i
do
let
it
get
me
down
it
for
a
bell
to
be
slow
and
plodding
most
of
the
time
you
do
want
to
go
home
and
discover
that
we
dispatched
the
to
upgrade
all
your
phones
with
video
screens
and
a
hush
mode
that
reads
your
thoughts
most
of
our
customers
still
ca
figure
out
voice
mail
some
of
them
ca
figure
out
dialing
so
we
slow
conservative
but
we
can
do
lots
of
killer
r
d
we
can
roll
out
really
hot
upgrades
on
the
back
end
and
we
can
provide
this
essential
service
to
the
world
that
underpins
its
ability
to
communicate
we
not
just
cool
we
essential
so
you
come
in
and
you
show
us
your
really
swell
and
interesting
meshing
wireless
data
boxes
and
i
say
is
damned
cool
i
think
of
ways
that
it
could
be
part
of
a
bell
business
plan
in
a
couple
decades
time
a
couple
decades
kurt
squawked
jesus
christ
i
expect
to
have
a
chip
in
my
brain
and
a
jetpack
in
a
couple
decades
time
which
is
why
you
be
an
idiot
to
get
involved
with
us
lyman
said
who
wants
to
get
involved
with
you
kurt
said
no
one
alan
said
putting
his
hands
on
the
table
grateful
that
the
conflict
had
finally
hove
above
the
surface
that
not
what
we
here
for
why
are
you
here
alvin
lyman
said
we
here
because
we
going
into
the
trade
in
an
ambitious
way
and
because
you
folks
are
the
most
ambitious
tradespeople
in
town
i
thought
we
come
by
and
let
you
know
what
we
up
to
see
if
you
have
any
advice
for
us
advice
huh
yeah
you
got
lots
of
money
and
linesmen
and
switches
and
users
and
so
forth
you
probably
have
some
kind
of
cosmology
of
connectivity
with
best
practices
and
philosophical
ruminations
and
tasty
metaphors
and
i
hear
that
you
personally
are
really
good
at
making
geeks
and
telcos
play
together
since
we
going
to
be
a
kind
of
telco
kurt
startled
and
alan
kicked
him
under
the
table
i
thought
you
could
help
us
get
started
right
advice
lyman
said
drumming
his
fingers
he
stood
up
and
paced
one
do
bother
this
is
at
least
two
orders
of
magnitude
harder
than
you
think
it
is
there
are
enough
junk
computers
in
all
of
landfills
to
blanket
the
city
in
free
wireless
the
range
is
nothing
but
three
hundred
feet
right
less
if
there
are
trees
and
buildings
and
this
city
is
all
trees
and
buildings
two
do
bother
the
liability
here
is
stunning
the
gear
building
is
nice
and
all
but
you
putting
it
into
people
hands
and
you
got
no
idea
what
they
going
to
do
with
it
they
going
to
hack
in
bigger
antennae
and
signal
amplifiers
the
radio
cops
will
be
on
your
ass
day
and
night
what
more
they
going
to
open
it
up
to
the
rest
of
the
world
and
any
yahoo
who
has
a
need
to
hide
what
he
up
to
is
going
to
use
your
network
to
commit
unspeakable
acts
you
going
to
be
every
best
friend
and
every
terrorist
safest
haven
three
do
bother
this
is
going
to
work
you
got
a
cute
little
routing
algorithm
that
runs
with
three
nodes
and
you
got
a
model
that
may
scale
up
to
but
by
the
time
you
get
to
thousand
going
to
be
hitting
so
much
latency
and
dropping
so
many
packets
on
the
floor
and
incurring
so
much
signaling
overhead
that
it
be
a
gigantic
failure
you
want
my
advice
turn
this
into
a
piece
of
enterprise
technology
a
cheap
way
of
rolling
out
managed
solutions
in
hotels
and
office
towers
and
condos
meshes
not
those
guys
will
pay
they
pay
a
hundred
bucks
per
punchdown
now
for
wired
networking
so
they
gladly
cough
up
a
thousand
bucks
a
floor
for
these
boxes
and
you
only
need
one
on
every
other
story
and
those
people
networks
they
not
joe
consumer
who
does
have
the
first
clue
what
to
do
with
a
network
connection
kurt
had
stiffened
up
when
the
rant
began
and
once
he
heard
the
word
consumer
he
began
to
positively
vibrate
alan
gave
him
a
warning
nudge
with
his
elbow
you
shitting
me
right
kurt
said
you
asked
me
for
advice
lyman
said
mildly
you
think
we
going
to
bust
our
balls
to
design
and
deploy
all
this
hardware
so
that
business
hotels
can
save
money
on
why
the
hell
would
we
want
to
do
that
because
it
pays
pretty
well
lyman
said
he
was
shaking
his
head
a
little
leaning
back
from
the
table
and
his
posse
picked
up
on
it
going
slightly
restless
and
fidgety
with
a
rustle
of
papers
and
clicking
of
pens
and
laptop
latches
alan
held
up
his
hand
lyman
i
sorry
we
been
unclear
we
not
doing
this
as
a
venture
kurt
snorted
it
about
serving
the
public
interest
we
want
to
give
our
neighbors
access
to
tools
and
ideas
that
they
would
have
had
before
there
something
fundamentally
undemocratic
about
charging
money
for
communications
it
means
that
the
more
money
you
have
the
more
you
get
to
communicate
so
we
trying
to
fix
that
in
some
small
way
we
are
heartily
appreciative
of
your
advice
though
lyman
held
up
a
hand
sorry
alan
i
do
mean
to
interrupt
but
there
was
something
i
wanted
to
relate
to
you
two
and
i
got
to
go
in
about
five
minutes
apparently
the
meeting
was
at
an
end
and
i
had
made
myself
a
note
to
tell
you
two
about
this
when
i
discovered
it
last
week
can
i
have
the
floor
of
course
alan
said
i
took
a
holiday
last
week
lyman
said
me
and
my
girlfriend
we
went
to
switzerland
to
see
the
alps
and
to
visit
her
sister
who
doing
something
for
the
un
in
geneva
so
her
sister
she
into
i
do
know
saving
children
from
vampires
in
afghanistan
or
something
and
she
has
internet
access
at
the
office
and
ca
see
any
reason
to
drop
a
connection
in
at
home
so
there
i
was
wandering
the
streets
of
geneva
at
seven
in
the
morning
trying
to
find
a
wifi
connection
so
i
can
get
my
email
and
find
out
how
many
ways
i
can
enlarge
my
penis
this
week
no
problem
outside
every
hotel
and
most
of
the
i
can
find
a
signal
for
a
network
called
swisscom
i
log
on
to
the
network
and
i
fire
up
a
browser
and
i
get
a
screen
asking
me
for
my
password
well
i
have
one
but
after
poking
around
i
find
out
that
i
can
buy
a
card
with
a
temporary
password
on
it
so
i
wait
until
some
of
the
little
smoke
shops
open
and
start
asking
them
if
they
sell
swisscom
internet
cards
in
my
terrible
miserable
french
and
after
chuckling
at
my
accent
they
look
at
me
and
say
have
no
clue
what
you
talking
about
shrug
and
go
back
to
work
then
i
get
the
idea
to
go
and
ask
at
the
hotels
the
first
one
the
guy
tells
me
that
they
only
sell
cards
to
guests
since
they
in
short
supply
the
cards
are
in
short
supply
three
hotels
later
they
allow
as
how
they
sell
me
a
card
oh
that
fine
thirty
whole
minutes
of
connectivity
whoopee
and
how
much
will
that
be
only
about
a
zillion
swiss
pesos
do
they
sell
cards
of
larger
denominations
oh
sure
two
hours
hours
seven
days
and
each
one
costs
about
double
the
last
so
if
you
want
you
can
get
a
seven
day
card
for
about
as
much
as
you
spend
on
a
day
worth
of
connectivity
in
increments
about
three
hundred
dollars
canadian
for
a
week
just
fyi
well
paying
bucks
for
a
week
internet
is
ghastly
but
very
swiss
where
they
charge
you
if
you
have
more
than
two
bits
of
cheese
at
breakfast
and
hell
i
could
afford
it
but
three
hundred
bucks
for
a
day
worth
of
cards
fuck
that
i
was
going
to
have
to
find
a
card
or
bust
so
i
ask
at
a
couple
more
hotels
and
finally
find
someone
who
explain
to
me
that
swisscom
is
the
swiss
telco
and
that
they
have
a
retail
storefront
a
couple
blocks
away
where
sell
me
all
the
cards
i
wanted
in
whatever
denominations
i
require
by
this
time
it
nearly
nine
and
i
thinking
that
my
girlfriend
and
her
sister
are
probably
up
and
eating
a
big
old
breakfast
and
wondering
where
the
fuck
i
am
but
i
got
too
much
invested
in
this
adventure
to
give
up
when
i
so
close
to
finding
the
treasure
and
so
i
hied
myself
off
to
the
swisscom
storefront
which
is
closed
even
though
the
sign
says
they
open
at
nine
and
by
now
it
and
so
much
for
swiss
punctuality
but
eventually
this
sneering
kid
with
last
year
comes
out
and
opens
the
door
and
then
disappears
up
the
stairs
at
the
back
of
the
show
room
to
the
second
floor
where
i
follow
him
i
get
up
to
his
counter
and
say
but
he
holds
up
a
hand
and
points
behind
me
and
says
i
make
an
elaborate
shrug
but
he
just
points
again
and
says
i
shrug
again
and
he
shakes
his
head
like
he
dealing
with
some
kind
of
unbelievable
moron
and
then
he
steps
out
from
behind
his
counter
and
stalks
over
to
a
little
touchscreen
he
takes
my
hand
by
the
wrist
and
plants
my
palm
on
the
touchscreen
and
a
little
ribbon
of
paper
with
slides
out
i
take
it
and
he
goes
back
behind
his
counter
and
says
i
can
tell
this
is
not
going
to
work
out
but
i
need
to
go
through
the
motions
i
go
to
the
counter
and
ask
for
a
card
he
opens
his
cash
drawer
and
paws
through
a
pile
of
cards
then
smiles
and
shakes
his
head
and
says
sorry
all
sold
out
my
girlfriend
is
probably
through
her
second
cup
of
coffee
and
reading
brochures
for
nature
walks
in
the
alps
at
this
point
so
i
say
fine
give
me
a
card
he
takes
a
moment
to
snicker
at
my
french
then
says
so
sorry
sold
out
those
too
two
hours
nope
half
an
hour
oh
those
we
got
think
about
this
for
a
second
i
am
sitting
there
with
my
laptop
in
hand
at
six
in
the
morning
on
a
swiss
street
connected
to
network
a
credit
card
in
my
other
hand
wishing
to
give
them
some
money
in
exchange
for
the
use
of
their
network
and
instead
i
have
to
go
chasing
up
and
down
every
hotel
in
geneva
for
a
card
which
is
not
to
be
found
so
i
go
to
the
origin
of
these
cards
the
swisscom
store
and
they
sold
out
too
this
is
not
a
or
a
loaf
of
bread
no
inherent
scarcity
in
or
cards
the
cards
are
just
a
convenient
place
to
print
some
numbers
and
all
you
need
to
do
to
make
more
numbers
is
pull
them
out
of
thin
air
they
just
numbers
we
have
as
many
of
them
as
we
could
possibly
need
there
no
sane
rational
universe
in
which
all
the
numbers
sell
out
leaving
nothing
behind
but
numbers
so
that
pretty
bad
it
the
kind
of
story
that
tell
about
all
around
the
world
it
the
kind
of
thing
i
made
it
my
business
to
hunt
down
and
exterminate
here
wherever
i
find
it
so
i
just
wrote
off
my
email
for
that
week
and
came
home
and
downloaded
a
hundred
thousand
spams
about
my
cock
insufficient
dimensions
and
went
in
to
work
and
i
told
everyone
i
could
find
about
this
and
they
all
smiled
nervously
and
none
of
them
seemed
to
find
it
as
weird
and
ridiculous
as
me
and
then
that
friday
i
went
into
a
meeting
about
our
new
wifi
service
that
we
piloting
in
montreal
and
the
guy
in
charge
of
the
program
hands
out
these
little
packages
to
everyone
in
the
meeting
a
slide
deck
and
some
of
the
marketing
collateral
and
a
little
prepaid
access
card
that
what
we
delivering
prepaid
cards
for
internet
access
number
shortages
and
business
travelers
prowling
the
bagel
joints
of
rue
st
urbain
looking
for
a
shopkeeper
whose
cash
drawer
has
a
few
cards
kicking
around
and
you
come
in
here
and
you
ask
me
you
ask
the
ruling
bell
what
advice
do
we
have
for
your
free
wireless
honestly
i
do
have
a
fucking
clue
we
do
have
a
fucking
clue
we
a
telephone
company
we
know
how
to
give
away
free
communications
we
do
even
know
how
to
charge
for
it
that
was
refreshingly
honest
kurt
said
i
wan
na
shake
your
hand
he
stood
up
and
lyman
stood
up
and
lyman
posse
stood
up
and
they
converged
on
the
doorway
in
an
orgy
of
handshaking
and
grinning
the
graybeard
handed
over
the
access
point
and
the
east
indian
woman
ran
off
to
get
the
other
two
and
before
they
knew
it
they
were
out
on
the
street
i
liked
him
kurt
said
i
could
tell
alan
said
remember
you
said
something
about
an
advisory
board
how
about
if
we
ask
him
to
join
that
is
a
and
deeply
weird
idea
partner
i
send
out
the
invite
when
we
get
home
kurt
said
that
the
anarchist
bookstore
would
be
a
slam
dunk
but
it
turned
out
to
be
the
hardest
sell
of
all
i
spoke
to
them
last
month
they
said
they
were
going
to
run
it
down
in
their
weekly
general
meeting
they
love
it
it
plus
they
all
want
connectivity
in
the
store
so
they
can
webcast
their
poetry
slams
just
go
on
by
and
introduce
yourself
tell
i
sent
you
ambrose
nodded
and
skewered
up
a
hunk
of
omelet
and
swirled
it
in
the
live
yogurt
the
greek
served
and
chewed
all
right
he
said
i
do
it
this
afternoon
you
look
exhausted
by
the
way
hard
night
in
the
salt
mines
kurt
looked
at
his
watch
i
got
about
an
hour
worth
of
diving
in
i
spent
the
rest
of
the
night
breaking
up
with
monica
monica
the
girlfriend
already
i
thought
you
two
just
got
together
last
month
kurt
shrugged
longest
fucking
month
of
my
life
all
she
wanted
to
do
was
go
clubbing
all
night
she
hated
staying
over
at
my
place
because
of
the
kids
coming
by
in
the
morning
to
work
on
the
access
points
i
sorry
pal
andy
said
he
never
knew
what
to
do
about
failed
romance
he
had
no
experience
in
that
department
since
the
seventh
grade
after
all
you
find
someone
else
soon
enough
too
soon
kurt
said
we
screamed
at
each
other
for
five
hours
before
i
finally
got
gone
it
was
probably
my
fault
i
lose
my
temper
too
easy
i
should
be
more
like
you
you
a
good
man
kurt
do
forget
it
kurt
ground
his
fists
into
his
eyes
and
groaned
i
such
a
he
said
alan
tugged
kurt
hand
away
from
his
face
stop
that
you
an
extraordinary
person
i
never
met
anyone
who
has
the
gifts
you
possess
and
i
met
some
gifted
people
you
should
be
very
proud
of
the
work
you
doing
and
you
should
be
with
someone
who
equally
proud
of
you
kurt
visibly
inflated
thanks
man
they
gripped
one
another
hands
for
a
moment
kurt
swiped
at
his
moist
eyes
with
the
sleeve
of
his
colorless
grey
sweatshirt
okay
it
way
past
my
bedtime
he
said
you
gon
na
go
to
the
bookstore
today
absolutely
thanks
for
setting
them
up
it
was
about
time
i
did
some
of
the
work
after
you
got
the
and
the
cheese
place
and
the
salvadoran
pupusa
place
kurt
i
just
doing
the
work
that
you
set
in
motion
it
all
you
this
project
i
just
your
helper
sleep
well
andy
watched
him
slouch
off
toward
home
reeling
a
little
from
sleep
deprivation
and
emotional
exhaustion
he
forked
up
the
rest
of
his
omelet
looked
reflexively
up
at
the
blinkenlights
on
the
ap
over
the
greek
sign
just
above
the
apostrophe
where
he
nailed
it
up
two
months
before
since
then
he
nailed
up
five
more
each
going
more
smoothly
than
the
last
at
this
rate
he
have
every
main
drag
in
the
market
covered
by
summer
sooner
if
he
could
offload
some
of
the
labor
onto
one
of
kurt
eager
kids
he
went
back
to
his
porch
then
and
watched
the
market
wake
up
the
traffic
was
mostly
bicycling
bankers
stopping
for
a
fresh
bagel
on
their
way
down
to
the
business
district
the
market
was
quite
restful
it
shuffled
like
an
old
man
in
carpet
slippers
setting
up
streetside
produce
tables
twiddling
the
dials
of
its
many
radios
looking
for
something
with
a
beat
he
watched
them
roll
past
the
salvadoran
pupusa
ladies
jamaican
patty
kings
italian
butchers
vietnamese
and
any
number
of
hotties
artistes
trustafarians
and
skaters
as
he
watched
them
go
past
he
had
an
idea
that
he
better
write
his
story
soon
or
maybe
never
maybe
never
nothing
maybe
this
was
his
last
season
on
earth
felt
like
that
apocalyptic
old
debts
come
to
be
settled
he
shuffled
upstairs
and
turned
on
the
disused
computer
which
had
sat
on
his
desk
for
months
and
was
therefore
no
longer
no
longer
nearly
so
exciting
no
longer
so
fraught
with
promise
still
he
made
himself
sit
in
his
seat
for
two
full
hours
before
he
allowed
himself
to
get
up
shower
dress
and
head
over
to
the
anarchist
bookstore
taking
a
slow
route
that
gave
him
the
chance
to
eyeball
the
lights
on
all
the
aps
he
installed
the
anarchist
bookstore
opened
lackadaisically
at
or
or
sometimes
noon
so
he
brought
along
a
nice
old
john
macdonald
paperback
with
a
bikini
girl
on
the
cover
to
read
he
liked
macdonald
books
you
could
always
tell
who
the
villainesses
were
because
the
narrator
made
a
point
of
noting
that
they
had
fat
asses
it
was
as
good
a
way
as
any
to
shorthand
the
world
he
thought
the
guy
who
came
by
to
open
the
store
was
vaguely
familiar
to
alfred
a
kensington
stalwart
of
about
forty
whose
thrifted
slacks
and
unraveling
sweater
were
hip
so
much
as
they
were
just
plain
old
down
and
out
he
had
a
haircut
and
carried
an
enormous
backpack
that
sagged
with
lefty
books
and
bags
of
organic
vegetariania
hi
there
arnold
said
pocketing
the
book
and
dusting
off
his
hands
hey
the
guy
said
into
his
stringy
beard
fumbling
with
a
keyring
i
be
opening
up
in
a
couple
minutes
okay
i
know
late
it
a
bad
day
okay
arnold
held
his
hands
up
palms
out
hey
no
problem
at
all
take
as
much
time
as
you
need
i
in
no
hurry
the
anarchist
hustled
around
inside
the
shop
turning
on
lights
firing
up
the
and
counting
out
a
float
switching
on
the
coffee
machine
alan
waited
patiently
by
the
doorway
holding
the
door
open
with
his
toe
when
the
clerk
hauled
out
a
rack
of
discounted
paperbacks
and
earning
a
dirty
look
for
his
trouble
okay
we
open
the
anarchist
said
looking
alan
in
the
toes
he
turned
around
and
banged
back
into
the
shop
and
perched
himself
behind
the
counter
opening
a
punk
newspaper
and
burying
his
nose
in
it
adam
walked
in
behind
him
and
stood
at
the
counter
politely
waiting
the
anarchist
looked
up
from
his
paper
and
shook
his
head
exasperatedly
yes
alan
extended
his
hand
hi
i
archie
i
work
with
kurt
over
on
augusta
the
anarchist
stared
at
his
hand
then
shook
it
limply
okay
he
said
so
kurt
mentioned
that
he
spoken
to
your
collective
about
putting
a
wireless
repeater
up
over
your
sign
the
anarchist
shook
his
head
we
decided
not
to
do
that
okay
he
went
back
to
his
paper
andrew
considered
him
for
a
moment
so
what
your
name
i
do
like
to
give
out
my
name
the
anarchist
said
call
me
waldo
all
right
all
right
andy
said
smiling
that
fine
by
me
so
can
i
ask
why
you
decided
not
to
do
it
it
does
fit
with
our
priorities
we
here
to
make
print
materials
about
the
movement
available
to
the
public
they
can
get
internet
access
somewhere
else
internet
access
is
for
people
who
can
afford
computers
anyway
good
point
art
said
that
a
good
point
i
wonder
if
i
could
ask
you
to
reconsider
though
i
love
a
chance
to
try
to
explain
why
this
should
be
important
to
you
i
do
think
so
waldo
said
we
not
really
interested
i
think
you
be
interested
if
it
were
properly
explained
to
you
waldo
picked
up
his
paper
and
pointedly
read
it
breathing
heavily
thanks
for
your
time
avi
said
and
left
that
kurt
said
christ
those
people
i
assumed
that
there
was
some
kind
of
politics
austin
said
and
i
did
want
to
get
into
the
middle
of
it
i
know
that
if
i
could
get
a
chance
to
present
to
the
whole
group
that
i
could
win
them
over
kurt
shook
his
head
angrily
his
shop
was
better
organized
now
with
six
access
points
ready
to
go
and
five
stuck
to
the
walls
as
a
test
bed
for
new
versions
of
the
software
a
couple
of
geeky
korean
kids
were
seated
at
the
communal
workbench
eating
donuts
and
wrestling
with
drivers
it
all
politics
with
them
everything
you
should
hear
them
argue
about
whether
it
cool
to
feed
meat
to
the
store
cat
who
was
working
behind
the
counter
he
would
tell
me
his
name
he
told
me
to
call
him
waldo
yeah
well
that
could
be
any
of
about
six
of
them
then
that
what
they
tell
the
cops
they
probably
thought
you
were
a
narc
or
a
fed
or
something
i
see
it
not
total
paranoia
they
been
busted
before
it
always
bullshit
i
raised
bail
for
a
couple
of
them
once
andrew
realized
that
kurt
thought
he
was
offended
at
being
mistaken
for
a
cop
but
he
got
that
he
was
weird
visibly
weird
out
of
place
wherever
he
was
so
they
owe
me
let
me
talk
to
them
some
more
thanks
kurt
i
appreciate
it
well
you
doing
all
the
heavy
lifting
these
days
it
the
least
i
can
do
alan
clapped
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
none
of
this
would
exist
without
you
you
know
he
waved
his
hand
to
take
in
the
room
the
korean
kids
the
whole
market
i
saw
a
bunch
of
people
at
the
greek
with
laptops
showing
them
around
to
each
other
and
drinking
beers
in
the
park
with
pdas
i
see
people
sitting
on
their
porches
typing
in
the
twilight
crouched
in
doorways
eating
a
bagel
in
the
morning
on
a
bench
people
are
finding
it
and
it
thanks
to
you
kurt
smiled
a
shy
smile
you
just
trying
to
cheer
me
up
he
said
course
i
am
andy
said
you
deserve
to
be
full
of
cheer
do
bother
andy
said
seriously
it
not
worth
it
we
just
find
somewhere
else
to
locate
the
repeater
it
not
worth
all
the
bullshit
you
getting
screw
that
they
told
me
that
they
take
one
they
the
only
ones
talked
into
it
my
contribution
to
the
effort
and
they
fucking
they
to
be
into
this
it
totally
irrational
he
was
almost
crying
i
do
want
you
to
screw
up
your
friendships
kurt
they
come
around
on
their
own
you
turning
yourself
inside
out
over
this
and
it
just
not
worth
it
come
on
it
cool
he
turned
around
his
laptop
and
showed
the
picture
to
kurt
check
it
out
people
with
tails
an
entire
gallery
of
them
there
were
lots
of
pictures
like
that
on
the
net
none
of
people
without
belly
buttons
though
kurt
took
a
pull
off
his
beer
disgusting
he
said
and
clicked
through
the
gallery
the
greek
looked
over
their
shoulder
it
real
it
real
larry
alan
said
freaky
huh
that
terrible
the
greek
said
pah
there
were
five
or
six
other
network
users
out
on
the
greek
and
it
was
early
yet
by
there
be
fifty
of
them
some
of
them
brought
their
own
power
strips
so
that
they
could
share
juice
with
their
coreligionists
you
really
want
me
to
give
up
kurt
asked
once
the
greek
had
given
him
a
new
beer
and
a
scowling
look
over
the
litter
of
beer
label
on
the
table
before
him
i
really
think
you
should
alan
said
it
a
poor
use
of
time
kurt
looked
ready
to
cry
again
adam
had
no
idea
what
to
say
okay
kurt
said
fine
he
finished
his
beer
in
silence
and
slunk
away
but
it
was
fine
and
kurt
would
give
it
up
he
kept
on
beating
his
head
against
the
blank
wall
and
every
time
alan
saw
him
he
was
grimmer
than
the
last
let
it
adam
said
i
done
a
deal
with
the
repair
guy
across
the
street
a
old
polish
holocaust
survivor
who
listened
attentively
to
andy
pitch
before
announcing
that
he
been
watching
all
the
hardware
go
up
around
the
market
and
had
simply
been
waiting
to
be
included
in
the
club
that
cover
that
corner
just
fine
i
going
to
throw
a
party
kurt
said
here
in
the
shop
no
rent
out
one
of
the
warehouses
on
oxford
i
invite
them
the
kids
everyone
who
let
us
put
up
an
access
point
a
big
buy
a
couple
kegs
no
one
can
resist
free
beer
alan
had
started
off
frustrated
and
angry
with
kurt
but
this
drew
him
up
and
turned
him
around
that
is
a
idea
he
said
invite
lyman
lyman
had
taken
to
showing
up
on
alan
stoop
in
the
morning
sometimes
on
his
way
to
work
for
a
cup
of
coffee
he
taken
to
showing
up
at
kurt
shop
in
the
afternoon
sometimes
on
his
way
home
from
work
to
marvel
at
the
kids
industry
his
graybeard
had
written
some
code
that
analyzed
packet
loss
and
tried
to
make
guesses
about
the
crowd
density
in
different
parts
of
the
market
and
lyman
took
a
proprietary
interest
in
it
standing
out
by
bikes
on
wheels
or
the
portuguese
furniture
store
and
watching
the
data
on
his
pda
comparing
it
with
the
actual
crowds
on
the
street
he
only
hesitated
for
a
second
when
andrew
asked
him
to
be
the
inaugural
advisor
on
parasitenet
board
and
once
he
said
yes
it
became
clear
to
everyone
that
he
was
endlessly
fascinated
by
their
little
adhocracy
and
its
experimental
telco
potential
this
party
sounds
like
a
great
idea
he
said
he
was
buying
the
drinks
because
he
was
the
one
with
glasses
and
a
racing
bike
lookit
that
he
said
from
the
greek
front
window
they
could
see
oxford
street
and
a
little
of
augusta
and
lyman
loved
using
his
pda
and
his
density
analysis
software
while
he
sat
looking
from
his
colored
map
to
the
crowd
scene
lookit
the
truck
as
it
goes
down
oxford
and
turns
up
augusta
that
signature
is
so
distinctive
i
could
spot
it
in
my
sleep
i
need
to
figure
out
how
to
sell
this
to
someone
maybe
the
cops
or
something
he
tipped
andy
a
wink
kurt
opened
and
shut
his
mouth
a
few
times
and
lyman
slapped
his
palm
down
on
the
table
you
look
like
you
going
to
bust
something
he
said
do
worry
i
kid
damn
you
got
you
some
big
buttons
kurt
made
a
face
you
wanted
to
sell
our
stuff
to
luxury
hotels
you
tried
to
get
us
to
present
at
the
you
capable
of
anything
the
skydome
would
be
a
great
venue
for
this
stuff
lyman
said
settling
into
one
of
his
favorite
variations
of
the
skydome
was
built
with
that
should
have
been
spent
on
affordable
housing
then
was
turned
over
to
rich
pals
of
the
premier
for
a
song
who
then
ran
it
into
the
ground
got
bailed
out
by
the
province
and
then
it
got
turned
over
to
different
rich
pals
you
can
just
shut
up
about
the
goddamned
skydome
you
have
to
break
both
of
my
legs
and
to
get
me
to
set
foot
in
there
about
the
party
adam
said
about
the
party
yes
certainly
lyman
said
kurt
behave
kurt
belched
loudly
provoking
a
scowl
from
the
greek
the
waldos
all
showed
up
in
a
bunch
with
plastic
brown
liter
bottles
filled
with
murky
homemade
beer
and
a
giant
bag
of
the
party
had
only
been
on
for
a
couple
hours
but
it
had
already
balkanized
into
groups
merchants
kids
hackers
kurt
kept
turning
the
music
way
up
if
they
not
going
to
talk
with
one
another
they
might
as
well
dance
kurt
those
people
are
old
old
people
do
dance
to
music
like
this
shut
up
lyman
make
me
and
andy
kept
turning
it
down
the
bookstore
people
drifted
in
then
stopped
and
moved
vaguely
toward
the
middle
of
the
floor
there
to
found
their
own
breakaway
conversational
republic
lyman
startled
sara
he
said
and
one
of
the
anarchists
looked
up
sharply
lyman
she
had
two
short
ponytails
and
a
round
face
that
made
her
look
teenage
young
but
on
closer
inspection
she
was
more
lyman
age
she
laughed
and
crossed
the
gap
to
their
little
republic
and
threw
her
arms
around
lyman
neck
crispy
christ
what
are
doing
here
i
work
with
these
guys
he
turned
to
arnold
and
kurt
this
is
my
cousin
sara
he
said
these
are
albert
and
kurt
i
helping
them
out
hi
sara
kurt
said
hey
kurt
she
said
looking
away
it
was
clear
even
to
alan
that
they
knew
each
other
already
the
other
bookstore
people
were
looking
on
with
suspicion
drinking
their
beer
out
of
refillable
thermos
cups
it
great
to
meet
you
alan
said
taking
her
hand
in
both
of
his
and
shaking
it
hard
i
really
glad
you
folks
came
down
she
looked
askance
at
him
but
lyman
interposed
himself
now
sara
these
guys
really
really
wanted
to
talk
something
over
with
you
all
but
they
been
having
a
hard
time
getting
a
hearing
kurt
and
alan
traded
uneasy
glances
they
carefully
planned
out
a
subtle
easeway
into
this
conversation
but
lyman
was
running
with
it
you
did
know
that
i
was
involved
huh
surprised
the
hell
outta
me
lyman
said
will
you
hear
them
out
she
looked
back
at
her
collective
what
the
hell
yeah
i
talk
into
it
it
starts
with
the
sinking
of
the
kurt
said
arranged
their
mismatched
chairs
in
a
circle
in
the
cramped
back
room
of
the
bookstore
and
were
drinking
and
eating
organic
crumbly
things
with
the
taste
and
consistency
of
sara
told
kurt
that
they
have
ten
minutes
and
alan
had
told
him
that
he
could
take
it
all
spent
the
day
reading
on
the
net
remembering
the
arguments
that
had
swayed
the
most
people
talking
it
over
he
was
determined
that
kurt
would
win
this
fight
there
this
ship
going
down
and
it
signaling
but
the
message
did
get
out
because
the
shipping
lanes
were
full
of
other
ships
with
other
radios
radios
that
clobbered
the
signal
that
because
there
were
no
rules
for
radio
back
then
so
anyone
could
light
up
any
transmitter
and
send
out
any
signal
at
any
frequency
imagine
a
room
where
everyone
shouted
at
the
top
of
their
lungs
nonstop
while
setting
off
air
horns
after
that
they
decided
that
fed
regulators
would
divide
up
the
radio
spectrum
into
bands
and
give
those
bands
to
exclusive
licensees
know
that
their
radio
waves
would
reach
their
destination
without
being
clobbered
because
any
clobberers
would
get
shut
down
by
the
cops
but
today
we
got
a
better
way
we
can
make
radios
that
are
capable
of
intelligently
cooperating
with
each
other
we
can
make
radios
that
use
databases
or
just
finely
tuned
listeners
to
determine
what
bands
are
in
use
at
any
given
moment
in
any
place
they
can
talk
between
the
gaps
in
other
signals
they
can
relay
messages
for
other
radios
they
can
even
try
to
detect
the
presence
of
dumb
radio
devices
like
tvs
and
fm
tuners
and
grab
the
signal
they
meant
to
be
receiving
off
of
the
internet
and
pass
it
on
so
that
the
dumb
device
does
even
realize
that
the
world
has
moved
on
now
the
original
radio
rules
were
supposed
to
protect
free
expression
because
if
everyone
was
allowed
to
speak
at
once
no
one
would
be
heard
that
may
have
been
true
but
it
was
a
pretty
poor
system
as
it
went
mostly
the
people
who
got
radio
licenses
were
cops
spooks
and
media
barons
there
are
a
lot
of
average
people
using
the
airwaves
to
communicate
for
free
with
one
another
not
a
lot
of
free
speech
but
now
we
have
all
this
new
technology
where
computers
direct
the
operation
of
flexible
radios
radios
whose
characteristics
are
determined
by
software
and
it
looking
like
the
scarcity
of
the
electromagnetic
spectrum
has
been
pretty
grossly
overstated
it
hard
to
prove
because
now
we
got
a
world
where
lighting
up
a
bunch
of
smart
agile
radios
is
a
crime
against
the
but
parliament
not
going
to
throw
the
airwaves
open
because
no
elected
politician
can
be
responsible
for
screwing
up
the
televisions
because
that
the
way
to
not
get
reelected
which
means
that
when
you
say
our
freedom
of
speech
is
being
clobbered
by
bad
laws
the
other
side
can
say
study
some
physics
hippie
or
produce
a
working
network
or
shut
up
the
radios
we
installing
now
are
about
one
millionth
as
smart
as
they
could
be
and
they
use
one
millionth
as
much
spectrum
as
they
could
without
stepping
on
anyone
else
signal
but
they
legal
and
letting
more
people
communicate
than
ever
there
are
people
all
over
the
world
doing
this
and
whenever
the
policy
wonks
go
to
the
radio
cops
to
ask
for
more
radio
spectrum
to
do
this
stuff
with
they
parade
people
like
us
in
front
of
them
we
like
the
pinocchio
nose
on
the
face
of
the
radio
cops
they
say
that
only
their
big
business
buddies
can
be
trusted
with
the
people
airwaves
and
we
show
them
up
for
giant
liars
he
fell
silent
and
looked
at
them
adam
held
his
breath
sara
nodded
and
broke
the
silence
you
know
that
sounds
pretty
cool
actually
kurt
insisted
on
putting
up
that
access
point
while
alan
and
lyman
steadied
the
ladder
sara
came
out
and
joked
with
lyman
and
alan
got
distracted
watching
them
trying
to
understand
this
notion
of
cousins
they
had
an
easy
rapport
despite
all
their
differences
and
spoke
in
a
shorthand
of
family
weddings
long
past
and
crotchety
relatives
long
dead
so
none
of
them
were
watching
when
kurt
overbalanced
and
dropped
the
makita
making
a
wild
grab
for
it
foot
slipping
off
the
rung
and
toppled
backward
it
was
only
kurt
wild
bark
of
panic
that
got
adam
to
instinctively
move
to
hold
out
his
arms
and
look
up
and
he
caught
kurt
under
the
armpits
and
gentled
him
to
the
ground
taking
the
weight
of
kurt
fall
in
a
crush
to
his
rib
cage
you
okay
alan
said
once
he
gotten
his
breath
back
oof
kurt
said
yeah
they
were
cuddled
together
on
the
sidewalk
kurt
atop
him
and
lyman
and
sara
bent
to
help
them
apart
nice
catch
lyman
said
kurt
was
helped
to
his
feet
and
he
declared
that
he
sprained
his
ankle
and
nothing
worse
and
they
helped
him
back
to
his
shop
where
a
couple
of
his
kids
doted
over
him
getting
him
an
ice
pack
and
a
pillow
and
his
laptop
and
one
of
the
many
discmen
from
around
the
shop
and
some
of
the
cds
of
old
punk
bands
that
he
favored
there
he
perched
growly
as
a
wounded
bear
master
of
his
kingdom
for
the
next
two
weeks
playing
online
and
going
twitchy
over
the
missed
dumpsters
going
to
the
landfill
every
night
without
his
expert
picking
over
alan
visited
him
every
day
and
listened
raptly
while
kurt
gave
him
the
stats
for
the
day
network
usage
and
kurt
beamed
proud
the
whole
while
one
morning
alan
threw
a
clatter
of
toonies
down
on
the
greek
counter
and
walked
around
the
market
smelling
the
last
night
staggering
pissers
and
the
morning
blossoms
here
were
his
neighbors
multicolored
heads
at
the
windows
of
their
sagging
house
adjoining
his
link
and
natalie
in
the
adjacent
windows
farthest
from
his
front
door
mimi
face
suspicious
at
her
window
and
was
that
krishna
behind
her
watching
over
her
shoulder
hand
between
her
wings
fingers
tracing
the
scars
depending
from
the
muscles
there
he
waved
at
them
the
reluctant
winter
made
every
day
feel
like
the
day
before
a
holiday
weekend
the
bankers
and
the
retail
slaves
coming
into
and
out
of
the
market
had
a
festive
air
he
waved
at
the
neighbors
and
link
waved
back
and
then
so
did
natalie
and
he
hefted
his
sack
of
coffees
from
the
greek
suggestively
and
mimi
shut
her
curtains
with
a
snap
but
natalie
and
link
smiled
and
a
moment
later
they
were
sitting
in
twig
chairs
on
his
porch
in
their
jammies
watching
the
world
go
past
as
the
sun
began
to
boil
the
air
and
the
coffee
tasted
as
good
as
it
smelled
beautiful
day
natalie
said
rubbing
the
duckling
fuzz
on
her
scalp
and
closing
her
eyes
found
any
work
yet
alan
said
remembering
his
promise
to
put
her
in
touch
with
one
of
his
fashionista
she
made
a
face
in
a
video
store
link
made
a
rude
noise
you
are
spoiled
not
just
any
video
store
she
working
at
martian
signal
on
queen
street
alan
knew
it
a
great
shop
with
a
huge
selection
of
cult
movies
and
a
brisk
trade
in
zines
transgressive
literature
action
figures
and
it
must
be
great
there
he
said
she
smiled
and
looked
away
it
okay
she
bit
her
lip
i
do
think
i
like
working
retail
she
said
ah
retail
he
said
retail
would
be
fantastic
if
it
was
for
the
fucking
customers
she
giggled
do
let
them
get
to
you
he
said
get
to
be
really
smart
about
the
stock
so
that
there
always
something
you
know
more
about
than
they
do
and
when
that
is
true
get
them
to
more
so
you
be
in
control
the
next
time
she
nodded
and
have
fun
with
the
computer
when
it
slow
he
said
what
a
store
like
that
it
got
the
home
phone
number
of
about
seventy
percent
of
the
people
in
toronto
you
want
to
ever
hang
out
with
most
of
your
school
friends
even
the
ones
you
lost
track
of
all
the
things
they
rented
all
their
old
addresses
you
can
figure
out
who
living
together
who
gave
their
apartment
to
whom
all
of
that
stuff
that
kind
of
database
is
way
more
fun
than
you
realize
you
can
get
lost
in
it
for
months
she
was
nodding
slowly
i
can
see
that
she
said
she
upended
her
coffee
and
set
it
down
listen
arbus
she
began
then
bit
her
lip
again
she
looked
at
link
who
tugged
at
his
fading
pink
shock
of
hair
it
nothing
he
said
we
get
emotionally
overwrought
about
friends
and
family
i
have
as
much
to
apologize
for
as
well
i
owe
you
an
apology
they
stared
at
the
park
across
the
street
at
the
damaged
wading
pool
where
edward
had
vanished
so
sorries
all
and
kisses
and
hugs
and
now
we
all
friends
again
huh
link
said
natalie
made
a
rude
noise
and
ruffled
his
hair
then
wiped
her
hand
off
on
his
shirt
alan
though
solemnly
shook
each
of
their
hands
in
turn
and
thanked
them
when
he
was
done
he
felt
as
though
a
weight
had
been
lifted
from
him
next
door
mimi
window
slammed
shut
what
is
it
you
doing
around
here
akin
link
said
i
keep
seeing
you
running
around
with
ladders
and
tool
belts
i
thought
you
were
a
writer
are
you
soundproofing
the
whole
market
i
never
told
you
alan
said
he
been
explaining
wireless
networking
to
anyone
who
could
sit
still
and
had
been
beginning
to
believe
that
he
run
it
down
for
every
denizen
of
kensington
but
he
forgotten
to
clue
in
his
own
neighbors
right
he
said
are
you
seated
comfortably
then
i
shall
begin
when
we
connect
computers
together
we
call
it
a
network
there
a
network
of
millions
of
computers
called
the
internet
even
know
this
natalie
said
shush
alan
said
i
start
at
the
beginning
where
i
started
a
year
ago
and
work
my
way
forward
it
weird
it
big
and
it
cool
and
he
told
them
the
story
the
things
he
learned
from
kurt
the
arguments
he
honed
on
the
shopkeepers
the
things
lyman
had
told
him
so
that
the
holy
mission
he
said
at
last
you
give
everyone
a
voice
and
a
chance
to
speak
on
a
level
playing
field
with
the
rich
and
powerful
and
you
make
democracy
which
is
good
he
looked
at
link
and
natalie
who
were
looking
to
one
another
rather
intensely
communicating
in
some
silent
idiom
of
sibling
natalie
said
funny
coincidence
link
said
we
were
just
talking
about
this
yesterday
spectrum
alan
quirked
his
eyebrows
no
not
exactly
natalie
said
about
making
a
difference
about
holy
missions
wondering
if
there
were
any
left
i
mean
link
said
riding
a
bike
or
renting
out
videos
are
honest
ways
to
make
a
living
and
all
and
they
keep
us
in
beer
and
rent
money
but
they
not
natalie
said
ah
alan
said
ah
well
that
the
thing
we
all
want
right
making
a
difference
yeah
which
is
why
you
went
into
fashion
link
said
giving
her
skinny
shoulder
a
playful
shove
she
shoved
him
back
and
why
went
into
electrical
engineering
okay
alan
said
it
not
necessarily
about
what
career
you
pick
it
about
how
you
do
what
you
do
natalie
you
told
me
you
used
to
shop
at
she
nodded
you
liked
it
you
used
to
shop
there
right
yeah
and
it
inspired
you
to
go
into
fashion
design
it
also
provided
employment
for
a
couple
dozen
people
over
the
years
i
sometimes
got
to
help
out
little
alternative
girls
from
north
toronto
buy
vintage
prom
dresses
at
the
end
of
the
year
and
i
helped
motown
revival
bands
put
together
matching
outfits
of
red
blazers
and
wide
trousers
four
or
five
little
shops
opened
up
nearby
selling
the
same
kind
of
thing
imitating
me
that
whole
little
strip
down
there
started
with
natalie
nodded
okay
i
knew
that
i
guess
but
it
not
the
same
as
making
a
difference
is
it
link
flicked
his
butt
to
the
curb
you
changing
people
lives
for
the
better
either
way
right
exactly
alan
said
then
link
grinned
but
there
something
pretty
oh
i
dunno
about
this
wireless
thing
yeah
it
not
the
same
not
the
same
alan
said
grinning
better
how
can
we
help
kurt
had
an
assembly
line
cranking
out
his
access
points
now
half
a
dozen
street
kids
worked
in
the
front
of
his
place
in
a
space
with
a
makeshift
workbench
made
from
bowed
plywood
and
scratched
ikea
it
made
alan
feel
better
to
watch
them
making
sense
of
it
all
made
him
feel
a
little
like
he
felt
when
he
was
working
on
the
inventory
the
kids
worked
from
noon
when
kurt
got
back
from
breakfast
until
or
when
he
went
out
to
dive
the
kids
were
smart
but
screwed
up
half
by
teenaged
hormones
and
half
by
bad
parents
or
bad
drugs
or
just
bad
brain
chemistry
alan
understood
their
type
trying
to
carve
some
atom
of
individual
identity
away
from
family
and
background
putting
pins
through
their
bodies
and
affecting
unconvincing
tough
mannerisms
they
were
often
bright
the
used
bookstore
had
been
full
of
their
type
buying
good
books
off
the
sale
rack
for
cents
trading
them
back
for
cents
credit
the
next
day
and
buying
more
natalie
and
link
were
in
that
morning
along
with
some
newcomers
montreal
street
punks
trying
their
hand
at
something
other
than
squeegee
bumming
the
punks
and
his
neighbors
gave
each
other
uneasy
looks
but
alan
had
deliberately
put
the
sugar
for
the
coffee
at
the
punks
end
of
the
table
and
the
cream
in
front
of
natalie
and
the
stirs
by
the
bathroom
door
with
the
baklava
and
the
napkins
so
a
rudimentary
social
intercourse
was
begun
first
one
of
the
punks
who
had
a
rusty
no
future
pin
that
alan
thought
would
probably
go
for
real
coin
on
the
collectors
market
asked
natalie
to
pass
her
the
cream
then
link
and
another
punk
foppy
silly
black
hair
and
a
private
school
blazer
with
the
short
sleeves
pinned
on
with
rows
of
safety
pins
met
over
the
baklava
and
the
punk
offered
link
a
napkin
another
punk
spilled
her
coffee
on
her
lap
screeching
horrendous
quebecois
blasphemies
as
curses
and
that
cracked
everyone
up
and
arnold
watching
from
near
the
blanket
that
fenced
off
kurt
monkish
sleeping
area
figured
that
they
would
get
along
kurt
he
said
pulling
aside
the
blanket
handing
a
coffee
over
to
kurt
as
he
sat
up
and
rubbed
his
eyes
he
was
wearing
a
white
that
was
the
grimy
grey
of
everything
in
his
domain
and
baggy
jockeys
he
gathered
his
blankets
around
him
and
sipped
reverently
kurt
cocked
his
head
and
listened
to
the
soft
discussions
going
on
on
the
other
side
of
the
blanket
christ
they
at
it
already
i
think
your
volunteers
showed
up
a
couple
hours
ago
or
maybe
they
were
up
all
night
kurt
groaned
theatrically
i
running
a
halfway
house
for
geeky
street
kids
all
for
the
cause
alan
said
so
what
on
the
plate
for
today
you
know
the
church
kittycorner
from
your
place
yeah
alan
said
cautiously
its
spire

just
about
the
highest
point
in
the
market
an
omnidirectional
up
there
the
church
yeah
what
about
the
new
condos
at
the
top
of
baldwin
they
tall
they
are
but
they
up
on
the
northern
edge
from
the
of
that
church
i
bet
you
could
shoot
half
the
houses
on
the
west
side
of
oxford
street
along
with
the
backs
of
all
the
shops
on
augusta
how
are
we
going
to
get
the
church
to
go
along
with
it
christ
what
are
they
ukrainian
orthodox
greek
orthodox
kurt
said
yeah
they
pretty
conservative
so
so
i
need
a
upstanding
cit
to
go
and
put
the
case
to
the
pastor
priest
bishop
whatever
groan
alex
said
oh
come
on
you
good
at
it
if
i
get
time
he
said
he
looked
into
his
coffee
for
a
moment
going
to
go
home
he
said
home
to
the
mountain
he
said
home
he
said
to
my
father
he
said
whoa
kurt
said
alone
alan
sat
on
the
floor
and
leaned
back
against
a
milk
crate
full
of
hard
drives
i
have
to
he
said
i
ca
stop
thinking
of
he
was
horrified
to
discover
that
he
was
on
the
verge
of
tears
it
had
been
three
weeks
since
davey
had
vanished
into
the
night
and
he
dreamt
of
every
night
since
terrible
dreams
in
which
he
dug
like
a
dog
to
uncover
their
hands
their
arms
their
legs
but
never
their
heads
he
swallowed
hard
he
and
kurt
had
spoken
of
that
night
since
i
sometimes
wonder
if
it
really
happened
kurt
said
alan
nodded
it
hard
to
believe
even
for
me
i
believe
it
kurt
said
i
wo
ever
not
believe
it
i
think
probably
important
to
you
alan
felt
a
sob
well
up
in
his
chest
and
swallowed
it
down
again
thanks
he
managed
to
say
when
are
you
leaving
tomorrow
morning
i
going
to
rent
a
car
and
drive
up
he
said
how
long
i
dunno
he
said
he
was
feeling
morose
now
a
couple
days
a
week
maybe
no
longer
well
do
sweat
the
bishop
he
can
wait
come
and
get
a
beer
with
me
tonight
before
i
go
out
yeah
he
said
that
sounds
good
on
a
patio
on
kensington
we
can
how
alan
and
his
brothers
killed
davey
very
deliberately
alan
spent
the
rest
of
the
winter
in
the
cave
and
davey
spent
the
spring
in
the
golem
cave
and
through
that
spring
neither
of
them
went
down
to
the
school
so
that
the
younger
brothers
had
to
escort
themselves
to
class
when
the
thaws
came
and
icy
meltoff
carved
temporary
streams
in
the
mountainside
they
stopped
going
to
school
too
instead
they
played
on
the
mountainside
making
dams
and
canals
and
locks
with
rocks
and
imagination
their
father
was
livid
the
mountain
rumbled
as
it
warmed
unevenly
as
the
sheets
of
ice
slid
off
its
slopes
and
skittered
down
toward
the
highway
the
sons
of
the
mountain
reveled
in
their
dark
ignorance
their
separation
from
the
school
and
from
the
nonsensical
and
nonmagical
society
of
the
town
they
snared
small
animals
and
ate
them
raw
and
did
wash
their
clothes
and
grew
fierce
and
guttural
through
the
slow
spring
alan
kept
silent
through
those
months
becoming
almost
nocturnal
refusing
to
talk
to
any
brother
who
dared
to
talk
to
him
when
brought
home
a
note
from
the
vice
principal
asking
when
he
thought
he
be
coming
back
to
school
alan
shoved
it
into
his
mouth
and
chewed
and
chewed
and
chewed
until
the
paper
was
reduced
to
gruel
then
he
spat
it
by
the
matted
pile
of
his
bedding
the
mountain
grumbled
and
he
did
care
the
golems
came
to
parley
and
he
turned
his
back
to
them
the
stalactites
crashed
to
the
cave
floor
until
it
was
carpeted
in
chips
of
stone
and
he
waded
through
them
he
waited
and
bided
he
waited
for
davey
to
try
to
come
home
what
have
we
here
alan
said
as
he
wandered
into
kurt
shop
which
had
devolved
into
joyous
bedlam
the
shelves
had
been
pushed
up
against
the
wall
clearing
a
large
open
space
that
was
lined
with
long
trestle
tables
goth
kids
hippie
kids
geeks
with
vintage
shirts
and
even
a
couple
of
older
street
people
crowded
around
the
tables
performing
a
conglomeration
of
arcane
tasks
the
air
hummed
with
conversation
and
coffee
smells
the
latter
emanating
from
a
urn
in
the
corner
he
was
roundly
ignored
and
before
he
could
speak
again
one
of
the
pcs
on
the
floor
started
booming
out
fuzzy
grungy
rockabilly
music
that
made
him
think
of
elvis
cassettes
that
had
been
submerged
in
salt
water
half
of
the
assembled
mass
started
bobbing
their
heads
and
singing
along
while
the
other
half
rolled
their
eyes
and
groaned
kurt
came
out
of
the
back
and
hunkered
down
with
the
pc
turning
down
the
volume
a
little
howdy
he
said
spreading
his
arms
and
taking
in
the
whole
of
his
dominion
howdy
yourself
alan
said
what
do
we
have
here
we
have
a
glut
of
volunteers
kurt
said
watching
as
an
old
rummy
carefully
shot
a
picture
of
a
lcd
that
was
minus
its
housing
i
ca
figure
out
if
those
laptop
screens
are
worth
anything
he
said
cocking
his
head
but
they
been
taking
up
space
for
far
too
long
time
we
moved
them
alan
looked
around
and
realized
that
the
workers
he
taken
to
be
at
work
building
access
points
were
in
the
main
shooting
digital
pictures
of
junk
from
kurt
diving
runs
and
researching
them
for
ebay
listings
it
made
him
feel
good
great
even
it
was
like
watching
an
inventory
being
assembled
from
out
of
chaos
where
they
all
come
from
kurt
shrugged
i
dunno
i
guess
we
hit
critical
mass
you
recruit
a
few
people
they
recruit
a
few
people
it
a
good
way
to
make
a
couple
bucks
you
get
to
play
with
boss
crap
you
get
paid
in
cash
and
you
have
colorful
he
shrugged
again
i
guess
they
came
from
wherever
the
trash
came
from
the
city
provides
the
homeless
guy
they
were
standing
near
squinted
up
at
them
if
either
of
you
says
something
like
these
people
were
discarded
by
society
but
just
as
with
the
junk
we
rescue
from
landfills
we
have
seen
the
worth
of
these
poor
folks
and
rescued
them
from
the
scrapheap
of
society
i
gon
na
puke
the
thought
never
crossed
my
mind
alan
said
solemnly
keep
it
up
wes
kurt
said
patting
the
man
on
the
shoulder
see
you
at
the
greek
tonight
every
night
so
long
as
he
keeps
selling
the
cheapest
beer
in
the
market
wes
said
winking
at
alan
it
cash
in
the
door
kurt
said
buying
components
is
a
lot
more
efficient
than
trying
to
find
just
the
right
parts
he
gave
alan
a
mildly
reproachful
look
ever
since
they
gone
to
strictly
controlled
designs
kurt
had
been
heartbroken
by
the
amount
of
really
nice
crap
that
never
made
its
way
into
an
access
point
this
is
pretty
amazing
alan
said
you
splitting
the
money
with
them
the
profit
anything
leftover
after
buying
packaging
and
paying
postage
he
walked
down
the
line
greeting
people
by
name
shaking
hands
marveling
at
the
gewgaws
and
gimcracks
that
he
after
all
had
found
in
some
nighttime
dumpster
and
brought
back
to
be
recycled
god
i
love
this
it
like
napster
for
dumpsters
how
that
alan
asked
pouring
himself
a
coffee
and
adding
some
uht
cream
from
a
giant
slightly
dented
box
of
little
creamers
most
of
the
music
ever
recorded
is
for
sale
at
any
price
like
percent
of
it
and
the
labels
they
made
copyright
so
strong
no
one
can
figure
out
who
all
that
music
belongs
to
not
even
them
costs
a
fortune
to
clear
a
song
pal
of
mine
once
did
a
cd
of
christmas
music
remixes
and
he
tried
to
figure
out
who
owned
the
rights
to
all
the
songs
he
wanted
to
use
he
just
gave
up
after
a
year
and
he
had
only
cleared
one
song
so
along
comes
napster
it
finds
the
only
possible
way
of
getting
all
that
music
back
into
our
hands
it
gives
millions
and
millions
of
people
an
incentive
to
rip
their
old
cds
hell
their
old
vinyl
and
tapes
too
and
put
them
online
no
label
could
have
afforded
to
do
that
but
the
people
just
did
it
for
free
it
was
like
a
a
library
raising
alan
nodded
so
what
your
point
that
companies
dumpsters
are
being
napstered
by
people
like
you
a
napsterized
inventory
alan
felt
the
of
it
kurt
picked
a
fragile
lcd
out
of
a
box
of
dozens
of
them
and
smashed
it
on
the
side
of
the
table
exactly
he
said
this
is
garbage
like
the
deleted
music
that
you
ca
buy
today
except
at
the
bottom
of
bins
at
goodwill
or
at
yard
sales
tons
of
it
has
accumulated
in
landfills
no
one
could
afford
to
pay
enough
people
to
go
around
and
rescue
it
all
and
figure
out
the
copyrights
for
it
and
turn
it
into
digital
files
and
upload
it
to
the
net
but
if
you
give
people
an
incentive
to
tackle
a
little
piece
of
the
problem
and
a
way
for
my
work
to
help
you
he
went
to
a
shelf
and
picked
up
a
finished
ap
and
popped
its
latches
and
swung
it
open
look
at
that
i
did
get
its
guts
out
of
a
dumpster
but
someone
else
did
like
as
not
i
sold
the
parts
i
found
in
my
dumpster
for
money
that
i
exchanged
for
parts
that
someone
else
found
in
dumpster
her
trying
not
to
be
sexist
kurt
said
are
there
female
dumpster
divers
got
me
kurt
said
in
ten
years
of
this
i
only
run
into
other
divers
twice
or
three
times
remind
me
to
tell
you
about
the
cop
later
anyway
we
spread
out
the
effort
of
rescuing
this
stuff
from
the
landfill
and
then
we
put
our
findings
online
and
we
move
it
to
where
it
needs
to
be
so
it
not
cost
effective
for
some
big
corporation
to
figure
out
how
to
use
or
sell
these
so
what
it
not
for
some
big
dumb
record
label
to
figure
out
how
to
keep
music
by
any
of
my
favorite
bands
in
print
either
we
figure
it
out
we
spookily
good
at
it
spookily
trying
to
be
more
poetic
he
grinned
and
twisted
the
fuzzy
split
ends
of
his
newly
blue
mohawk
around
his
fingers
got
a
new
girlfriend
she
says
there
not
enough
poetry
in
my
views
on
garbage
they
found
one
of
davey
old
nests
in
march
on
a
day
when
you
could
almost
believe
that
the
spring
would
really
come
and
the
winter
would
go
and
the
days
would
lengthen
out
to
more
than
a
few
hours
of
sour
greyness
huddled
around
noon
the
reference
design
for
the
access
point
had
gone
through
four
more
iterations
and
if
you
knew
where
to
look
in
the
market
apartments
rooftops
and
lampposts
you
could
trace
the
evolution
of
the
design
from
the
clunky
boxen
in
alan
attic
on
wales
avenue
to
the
milspec
surplus
boxes
that
kurt
had
rigged
from
old
circuit
boxes
he
found
in
bell
canada
willowdale
switching
station
dumpster
alan
steadied
the
ladder
while
kurt
tightened
the
wing
nuts
on
the
antenna
mounting
atop
the
synagogue
roof
it
had
taken
three
meetings
with
the
old
rabbi
before
alan
hit
on
the
idea
of
going
to
the
youth
caucus
and
getting
to
explain
it
to
the
old
cleric
the
synagogue
was
one
of
the
oldest
buildings
in
the
market
a
beauty
from
they
worried
about
the
fight
they
have
over
drilling
through
the
roof
to
punch
down
a
wire
but
they
need
have
the
wood
up
there
was
soft
as
cottage
cheese
and
showed
gaps
wide
enough
to
slip
the
power
cable
down
now
kurt
slathered
loctite
over
the
nuts
and
washers
and
slipped
dangerously
down
the
ladder
flying
over
the
rungs
alan
laughed
as
he
touched
down
thinking
that
kurt
heart
was
aburst
with
the
feeling
of
having
finished
at
last
at
last
but
then
he
caught
sight
of
kurt
face
ashen
i
saw
something
he
said
talking
out
of
the
sides
of
his
mouth
his
hands
were
shaking
what
footprints
he
said
there
a
lot
of
leaves
that
have
rotted
down
to
mud
up
there
and
there
were
a
pair
of
little
footprints
in
the
mud
like
a
toddler
footprints
maybe
except
there
were
two
toes
missing
from
one
foot
they
were
stamped
down
all
around
this
spot
where
i
could
see
there
had
been
a
lot
of
pigeon
nests
but
there
were
no
pigeons
there
only
a
couple
of
beaks
and
legs
so
dried
up
that
i
could
figure
out
what
they
were
at
first
but
i
recognized
the
footprints
the
missing
toes
they
left
prints
behind
like
unbent
paperclips
alan
moved
as
in
a
dream
to
the
ladder
and
began
to
climb
it
be
careful
it
all
rotten
up
there
kurt
called
alan
nodded
sure
thank
you
he
said
hearing
himself
say
it
as
though
from
very
far
away
the
rooftop
was
littered
with
broken
glass
and
scummy
puddles
of
meltwater
and
little
pebbles
and
a
slurry
of
decomposing
leaves
and
there
yes
there
were
the
footprints
just
as
advertised
he
patted
the
antenna
box
absently
feeling
its
solidity
and
he
sat
down
before
the
footprints
and
the
beaks
and
the
legs
there
were
no
tooth
marks
on
the
birds
they
had
been
eaten
they
been
torn
apart
like
a
label
from
a
beer
bottle
absently
shredded
in
the
sunset
he
pictured
davey
sitting
here
on
the
synagogue
roof
listening
to
the
evening
prayers
and
the
calls
and
music
that
floated
over
the
market
watching
the
grey
winter
nights
come
on
and
slip
away
a
pigeon
in
his
hand
writhing
he
wondered
if
he
was
catching
bradley
precognition
and
if
that
meant
that
bradley
was
dead
now
bradley
was
born
with
the
future
in
his
eyes
he
emerged
from
the
belly
of
their
mother
with
bright
brown
eyes
that
did
not
roll
aimlessly
in
the
manner
of
babies
but
rather
sought
out
the
corners
of
the
cave
where
interesting
things
were
happening
where
movement
was
about
to
occur
where
life
was
being
lived
before
he
developed
the
muscle
strength
and
coordination
necessary
to
crawl
he
mimed
crawling
seeing
how
it
was
that
he
would
someday
move
he
was
the
easiest
of
all
the
babies
to
care
for
easier
even
than
carlo
who
had
no
needs
other
than
water
and
soil
and
cooing
reassurance
toilet
training
as
soon
as
he
understood
what
was
expected
of
him
they
used
the
bend
of
one
of
the
underground
rivers
benny
could
be
relied
upon
to
begin
tottering
toward
the
spot
in
sufficient
time
to
drop
trou
and
do
his
business
in
just
the
right
spot
alan
learned
to
pay
attention
when
bruce
was
reluctant
to
leave
home
for
a
walk
during
those
days
the
same
premonition
that
made
him
perfectly
at
home
would
have
him
in
fretting
sweats
at
the
foreknowledge
that
he
has
destined
to
soil
himself
during
the
recreation
his
nightmares
ran
twice
once
just
before
bed
in
clairvoyant
preview
and
again
in
the
depths
of
rem
sleep
alan
learned
to
talk
him
down
from
these
crises
to
soothe
the
worry
and
in
the
end
it
worked
to
everyone
advantage
defusing
the
nightmares
themselves
when
they
came
he
never
forgot
anything
never
forgot
to
have
alan
forge
a
signature
on
a
permission
form
never
forgot
to
bring
in
the
fossil
he
found
for
never
forgot
his
mittens
in
the
cloakroom
and
came
home
with
red
chapped
hands
once
he
started
school
he
started
seeing
to
it
that
alan
never
forgot
anything
either
he
did
very
well
on
quizzes
and
tests
and
he
never
let
the
pitcher
fake
him
out
when
he
was
at
bat
after
four
years
alone
with
the
golems
alan
could
have
been
more
glad
to
have
a
brother
to
keep
him
company
billy
got
big
enough
to
walk
then
big
enough
to
pick
mushrooms
then
big
enough
to
chase
squirrels
he
was
big
enough
to
play
with
big
enough
to
play
twenty
questions
with
big
enough
to
horse
around
in
the
middle
of
the
lake
at
the
center
of
the
mountain
with
alan
left
him
alone
during
the
days
in
the
company
of
their
parents
and
the
golems
went
down
the
mountain
to
school
and
when
he
got
back
take
his
kid
brother
out
on
the
mountain
face
and
teach
him
what
learned
even
though
he
was
only
a
little
kid
they
write
letters
together
in
the
mud
with
a
stick
and
in
the
winter
they
try
to
spell
out
their
names
with
steaming
pee
in
the
snow
laughing
that
a
fraction
brad
said
chalking
on
a
piece
of
slate
by
the
side
of
one
of
the
snowmelt
streams
that
coursed
down
the
springtime
mountain
that
right
alan
said
he
learned
it
that
day
in
school
and
had
been
about
to
show
it
to
billy
which
meant
that
brad
had
remembered
him
doing
it
and
now
knew
it
he
took
the
chalk
and
drew
his
own
you
had
to
do
that
or
billy
would
be
able
to
remember
it
in
advance
billy
got
down
on
his
haunches
he
was
a
dark
kid
dark
hair
and
eyes
the
color
of
chocolate
which
he
insatiably
craved
and
begged
for
every
morning
when
alan
left
for
school
bring
me
bring
me
bring
me
he
found
something
alan
leaned
in
and
saw
that
it
was
a
milkweed
pod
it
an
egg
bobby
said
no
it
a
weed
alan
said
bobby
was
usually
given
to
flights
of
fancy
but
the
shape
of
the
pod
was
reminiscent
of
an
egg
billy
clucked
his
tongue
i
that
it
also
an
egg
for
a
bug
living
inside
there
i
can
see
it
hatching
next
week
he
closed
his
eyes
it
orange
pretty
we
should
come
back
and
find
it
once
it
hatches
alan
hunkered
down
next
to
him
there
a
bug
in
here
yeah
it
like
a
white
worm
but
in
a
week
it
will
turn
into
an
orange
bug
and
chew
its
way
out
he
was
about
three
then
which
made
alan
seven
what
if
i
chopped
down
the
plant
he
said
would
the
bug
still
hatch
next
week
you
wo
billy
said
i
could
though
nope
brad
said
alan
reached
for
the
plant
took
it
in
his
hand
the
warm
skin
of
the
plant
and
the
woody
bole
of
the
pod
would
be
so
easy
to
uproot
he
did
do
it
that
night
as
he
lay
himself
down
to
sleep
he
could
remember
why
he
had
he
could
sleep
he
got
up
and
looked
out
the
front
of
the
cave
at
the
countryside
unrolling
in
the
moonlight
and
the
far
lights
of
the
town
he
went
back
inside
and
looked
in
on
benji
he
was
sleeping
his
face
smooth
and
his
lips
pouted
he
rolled
over
and
opened
his
eyes
regarding
alan
without
surprise
told
you
so
he
said
alan
had
an
awkward
relationship
with
the
people
in
town
unaccompanied
little
boys
in
the
grocery
store
at
the
gap
in
the
library
and
in
toy
section
of
the
canadian
tire
were
suspect
alan
never
horsed
around
whatever
that
meant
but
nevertheless
he
got
more
than
his
share
of
the
hairy
eyeball
from
the
shopkeepers
even
though
he
had
money
in
his
pocket
and
had
been
known
to
spend
it
on
occasion
a
lone
boy
of
five
or
six
or
seven
was
suspicious
but
let
him
show
up
with
the
tiny
hand
of
his
dark
little
brother
clasped
in
his
quietly
explaining
each
item
on
the
shelf
to
the
solemn
child
and
everyone
got
an
immediate
attitude
adjustment
shopkeepers
smiled
and
nodded
shoppers
mouthed
so
cute
to
each
other
moms
with
babies
in
snuglis
bent
to
chuckle
them
under
their
chins
store
owners
spontaneously
gave
them
candy
and
laughed
aloud
at
bryan
cries
of
chocolate
when
brian
started
school
he
foresaw
and
avoided
all
trouble
and
delighted
his
teachers
with
his
precociousness
alan
ate
lunch
with
him
once
he
reached
the
first
grade
and
started
eating
in
the
cafeteria
with
the
rest
of
the
brad
loved
to
play
with
craig
after
he
was
born
patiently
mounding
soil
and
pebbles
on
his
shore
watering
him
and
patting
him
smooth
planting
wild
grasses
on
his
slopes
as
he
crept
toward
the
mouth
of
the
cave
those
days
before
darcy
arrival
were
a
long
idyll
of
good
food
and
play
in
the
hot
sun
or
the
white
snow
and
brotherhood
danny
could
sneak
up
on
brad
and
kick
him
in
the
back
of
the
head
he
could
hide
a
rat
in
his
pillow
or
piss
on
his
toothbrush
billy
was
never
one
to
stand
pat
and
eat
shit
just
because
davey
was
handing
it
out
sometimes
he
just
wind
up
and
take
a
swing
at
davey
seemingly
out
of
the
blue
knocking
him
down
then
prying
open
his
mouth
to
reveal
the
chocolate
bar
he
nicked
from
under
brad
pillow
or
a
comic
book
from
under
his
shirt
he
was
only
two
years
younger
than
brad
but
by
the
time
they
were
both
walking
brad
hulked
over
him
and
could
lay
him
out
with
one
wild
haymaker
of
a
punch
billy
came
down
from
his
high
perch
when
alan
returned
from
burying
marci
holding
out
his
hands
wordlessly
he
hugged
alan
hard
crushing
the
breath
out
of
him
the
arms
felt
good
around
his
neck
so
he
stopped
letting
himself
feel
them
he
pulled
back
stiffly
and
looked
at
brian
you
could
have
told
me
he
said
bram
face
went
expressionless
and
hard
and
cold
telling
people
what
he
did
not
for
years
it
hurt
others
and
it
hurt
him
it
was
the
reason
for
his
long
long
silences
alan
knew
that
sometimes
he
could
tell
what
it
was
that
he
knew
that
others
did
but
he
care
then
you
should
have
told
me
he
said
bob
took
a
step
back
and
squared
up
his
shoulders
and
his
feet
leaning
forward
a
little
as
into
a
wind
you
and
you
did
and
you
did
and
as
far
as
i
concerned
you
killed
her
and
cut
her
up
and
buried
her
along
with
darryl
you
coward
adam
knew
he
was
crossing
a
line
and
he
did
care
brian
leaned
forward
and
jutted
his
chin
out
avram
hands
were
clawed
with
cold
and
caked
with
mud
and
still
echoing
the
feeling
of
frozen
skin
and
frozen
dirt
and
balled
up
into
fists
they
felt
like
stones
he
did
hit
barry
instead
he
retreated
to
his
niche
and
retrieved
the
triangular
piece
of
flint
that
he
been
cherting
into
an
arrowhead
for
school
and
a
hammer
stone
and
set
to
work
on
it
in
the
light
of
a
flashlight
he
sharpened
a
knife
for
davey
there
in
his
room
in
the
cave
as
the
boys
ran
feral
in
the
woods
as
the
mountain
made
its
slow
and
ponderous
protests
he
sharpened
a
knife
a
hunting
knife
with
a
rusty
blade
and
a
cracked
handle
that
he
found
on
one
of
the
woodland
trails
beside
a
snare
not
lost
but
pitched
away
in
disgust
one
winter
and
not
discovered
until
the
following
spring
but
the
nicked
blade
took
an
edge
as
he
whetted
it
with
the
round
stone
and
the
handle
regained
its
grippiness
as
he
wound
a
cord
tight
around
it
making
tiny
precise
knots
with
each
turn
until
the
handle
no
longer
pinched
his
hand
until
the
blade
caught
the
available
light
from
the
cave
mouth
and
glinted
dully
the
boys
brought
him
roots
and
fruits
they
gathered
sweets
and
bread
they
stolen
small
animals
they
caught
were
an
unbeatable
team
when
it
came
to
catching
and
killing
an
animal
though
they
were
only
small
barely
out
of
the
second
grade
they
were
fast
and
they
could
coordinate
their
actions
without
speaking
so
that
the
bunny
or
the
squirrel
could
never
duck
or
feint
in
any
direction
without
encountering
the
thick
outstretched
hands
of
the
pudgy
boys
once
they
brought
him
a
cat
it
went
in
the
night
stew
billy
sat
at
his
side
and
talked
the
silence
he
folded
himself
in
unwrapped
and
flapped
in
the
wind
of
his
beating
gums
he
talked
about
the
lessons
he
had
in
school
and
the
lessons
he
had
from
his
big
brother
when
it
was
just
the
two
of
them
on
the
hillside
and
alan
would
teach
him
every
thing
he
knew
the
names
of
and
salient
facts
regarding
every
thing
in
their
father
domain
he
talked
about
the
truths
gleaned
from
reading
wrappers
he
talked
about
the
things
that
he
see
davey
doing
when
no
one
else
could
see
it
one
day
george
came
to
him
the
baby
grown
to
toddling
about
on
two
sturdy
legs
fat
and
crispy
red
from
his
unaccustomed
time
and
in
the
sun
you
know
he
you
glenn
said
gesturing
at
the
spot
in
his
straw
bedding
where
brad
habitually
sat
and
gazed
at
him
and
chattered
alan
stared
at
his
shoelaces
it
does
matter
he
said
he
dreamt
that
night
of
davey
stealing
into
the
cave
and
squatting
beside
him
watching
him
the
way
that
he
had
before
and
of
alan
knowing
that
davey
was
there
ready
to
rend
and
tear
knowing
that
his
knife
with
its
coiled
handle
was
just
under
his
pillow
but
not
being
able
to
move
his
arms
or
legs
paralyzed
he
watched
davey
grin
and
reach
behind
him
with
agonizing
slowness
for
a
rock
that
he
lifted
high
above
his
head
and
andrew
had
seen
that
the
rock
had
been
cherted
to
a
razor
edge
that
hovered
a
few
feet
over
his
breastbone
davey
arms
trembling
with
the
effort
of
holding
it
aloft
a
single
drop
of
sweat
had
fallen
off
of
davey
chin
and
landed
on
alan
nose
and
then
another
and
finally
he
been
able
to
open
his
eyes
and
wake
himself
angry
and
scared
the
spring
rains
had
begun
and
the
condensation
was
thick
on
the
cave
walls
dripping
onto
his
face
and
arms
and
legs
as
he
slept
leaving
behind
chalky
lime
residue
as
it
evaporated
he
did
kill
her
greg
said
albert
had
told
the
younger
brothers
about
the
body
buried
in
craig
which
meant
that
brad
had
been
talking
to
them
had
told
them
what
seen
alan
felt
an
irrational
streak
of
anger
at
brad
he
been
blabbing
alan
secrets
he
been
exposing
the
young
ones
to
things
they
did
need
to
know
to
the
nightmares
he
did
stop
her
from
being
killed
alan
said
he
had
the
knife
in
his
hand
and
hunted
through
his
pile
of
belongings
for
the
whetstone
to
hone
its
edge
greg
looked
at
the
knife
and
andy
followed
his
gaze
to
his
own
white
knuckles
on
the
hilt
greg
took
a
frightened
step
back
and
alan
who
had
often
worried
that
the
smallest
brother
was
too
delicate
for
the
real
world
felt
ashamed
of
himself
he
set
the
knife
down
and
stood
stretching
his
limbs
and
leaving
the
cave
for
the
first
time
in
weeks
brad
found
him
standing
on
the
slopes
of
the
gentle
soggy
hump
of
charlie
slope
a
few
feet
closer
to
the
seaway
than
it
had
been
that
winter
when
alan
had
dug
up
and
reburied
marci
body
there
you
forgot
this
brad
said
handing
him
the
knife
alan
took
it
from
him
it
was
sharp
and
dirty
and
the
handle
was
grimed
with
sweat
and
lime
thanks
kid
he
said
he
reached
down
and
took
billy
hand
the
way
he
done
when
it
was
just
the
two
of
them
the
three
eldest
sons
of
the
mountain
stood
there
touching
and
watched
the
outside
world
rush
and
grind
away
in
the
distance
its
humming
engines
and
puffing
chimneys
brendan
tugged
his
hand
free
and
kicked
at
the
dirt
with
a
toe
smoothing
over
the
divot
he
made
with
the
sole
of
his
shoe
andy
noticed
that
the
sneaker
was
worn
out
and
had
a
hole
in
the
toe
and
that
it
was
only
laced
up
halfway
got
to
get
you
new
shoes
he
said
bending
down
to
relace
them
he
had
to
stick
the
knife
in
the
ground
to
free
his
hands
while
he
worked
the
handle
vibrated
davey
coming
benny
said
coming
now
alan
reached
out
as
in
his
dream
and
felt
for
the
knife
but
it
there
as
in
his
dream
he
looked
around
as
the
skin
on
his
face
tightened
and
his
heart
began
to
pound
in
his
ears
and
he
saw
that
it
had
merely
fallen
over
in
the
dirt
he
picked
it
up
and
saw
that
where
it
had
fallen
it
had
knocked
away
the
soil
that
had
barely
covered
up
a
small
freckled
hand
now
gone
black
and
curled
into
a
fist
like
a
monkey
paw
marci
hand
he
coming
benny
took
a
step
off
the
hill
you
wo
lose
he
said
you
got
the
knife
the
hand
was
small
and
fisted
there
in
the
dirt
it
had
been
just
below
the
surface
of
where
he
been
standing
it
had
been
there
in
clarence
soil
for
months
decomposing
the
last
of
marci
going
somewhere
just
below
that
soil
was
her
head
her
face
sloughing
off
and
wormed
her
red
hair
fallen
from
her
loosened
scalp
he
gagged
and
a
gush
of
bile
sprayed
the
hillside
danny
hit
him
at
the
knees
knocking
him
into
the
dirt
he
felt
the
little
rotting
fist
digging
into
his
ribs
his
body
bucked
of
its
own
accord
and
he
knocked
danny
loose
of
his
legs
his
arm
was
hot
and
slippery
and
when
he
looked
at
it
he
saw
that
it
was
coursing
with
blood
the
knife
in
his
other
hand
was
bloodied
and
he
saw
that
drawn
a
long
ragged
cut
along
his
bicep
a
fountain
of
blood
bubbled
there
with
every
beat
of
his
heart
blub
blub
blub
and
on
the
third
blub
he
felt
the
cut
like
a
long
pin
stuck
in
the
nerve
he
climbed
unsteadily
to
his
feet
and
confronted
danny
danny
was
naked
and
the
color
of
the
red
golem
clay
his
ribs
showed
and
his
hair
was
matted
and
greasy
i
coming
home
danny
said
baring
his
teeth
his
breath
reeked
of
corruption
and
uncooked
meat
and
his
mouth
was
ringed
with
a
crust
of
dried
vomit
and
you
not
going
to
stop
me
you
do
have
a
home
alan
said
pressing
the
hilt
of
the
knife
over
the
wound
in
his
bicep
the
feeling
like
biting
down
on
a
cracked
tooth
you
not
welcome
davey
was
monkeyed
over
low
arms
swinging
like
a
chimp
teeth
bared
knees
splayed
and
ready
to
uncoil
and
pounce
you
think
you
stab
me
with
that
he
said
jerking
his
chin
at
the
knife
or
are
you
just
going
to
bleed
yourself
out
with
it
alan
steadied
his
knife
hand
before
him
unmindful
of
the
sticky
blood
he
knew
that
the
pounce
was
coming
but
that
did
help
when
it
came
davey
leapt
for
him
and
he
slashed
once
with
the
knife
davey
ducking
beneath
the
arc
and
then
davey
had
his
forearm
in
his
hands
his
teeth
fastened
onto
the
meat
of
his
knife
thumb
andre
rolled
to
one
side
and
gripped
down
hard
on
the
knife
tugging
his
arm
ineffectually
against
the
grip
of
the
cruel
teeth
and
the
grasping
bony
fingers
davey
had
lost
his
boyish
charm
gone
simian
with
filth
and
rage
and
the
sore
and
weak
blows
alan
was
able
to
muster
with
his
hurt
arm
did
seem
to
register
with
danny
at
all
as
he
bit
down
harder
arnold
dragged
his
arm
up
higher
dragging
the
glinting
knifetip
toward
davey
face
drew
kicked
at
his
shins
planted
a
knee
alongside
his
groin
alan
whipped
his
head
back
then
brought
it
forward
as
fast
and
hard
as
he
could
hammering
his
forehead
into
the
crown
of
davey
head
so
hard
that
his
head
rang
like
a
bell
he
stunned
davey
free
of
his
hand
and
stunned
himself
onto
his
back
he
felt
small
hands
beneath
each
armpit
dragging
him
clear
of
the
hill
brian
and
george
they
helped
him
to
his
feet
and
breton
handed
him
the
knife
again
darren
got
onto
his
knees
and
then
to
his
feet
holding
the
back
of
his
head
they
both
swayed
slightly
standing
to
either
side
of
rise
alan
was
red
with
blood
streaming
from
the
bite
wounds
and
his
other
arm
felt
unaccountably
heavy
now
davey
was
staggering
back
and
forth
a
little
eyes
dropping
to
the
earth
suddenly
he
dropped
to
one
knee
and
scrabbled
in
the
dirt
then
scrambled
back
with
something
in
his
hand
marci
fist
he
waggled
it
at
andrew
mockingly
then
charged
crossing
the
distance
between
them
with
long
loping
strides
the
fist
held
out
before
him
like
a
lance
alan
forgot
the
knife
in
his
hand
and
shrank
back
and
then
davey
was
on
him
again
dropping
the
fist
to
the
mud
and
taking
hold
of
alan
digging
his
ragged
nails
into
the
bleeding
bites
there
now
alan
released
the
knife
so
that
it
too
fell
to
the
mud
and
the
sound
it
made
woke
him
from
his
reverie
he
pulled
his
hand
free
of
davey
grip
and
punched
him
in
the
ear
as
hard
as
he
could
simultaneously
kneeing
him
in
the
groin
davey
hissed
and
punched
him
in
the
eye
a
feeling
like
his
eyeball
was
going
to
break
open
a
feeling
like
he
been
stabbed
in
the
back
of
his
eye
socket
he
planted
a
foot
in
the
mud
for
leverage
then
flipped
danny
over
so
that
alan
was
on
top
knees
on
his
skinny
chest
the
knife
was
there
beside
davey
head
and
alan
snatched
it
up
holding
it
ready
for
stabbing
danny
eyes
narrowed
alan
could
do
it
kill
him
altogether
dead
finished
yeah
stab
him
in
the
face
or
the
heart
or
the
lung
somewhere
fatal
he
could
kill
davey
and
make
him
go
away
forever
davey
caught
his
eye
and
held
it
and
alan
knew
he
could
do
it
and
an
instant
later
davey
knew
it
too
he
smiled
a
crusty
smile
and
went
limp
oh
do
hurt
me
he
said
mockingly
please
big
brother
do
stab
me
with
your
big
bad
knife
alan
hurt
all
over
but
especially
on
his
bicep
and
his
thumb
his
head
sang
with
pain
and
blood
loss
do
hurt
me
please
davey
said
billy
was
standing
before
him
suddenly
that
what
marci
said
when
he
took
her
hurt
me
please
he
said
she
said
it
over
and
over
again
while
he
dragged
her
here
while
he
choked
her
to
death
alan
held
the
knife
tighter
he
said
it
over
and
over
again
as
he
cut
her
up
and
buried
her
he
danny
suddenly
bucked
hard
almost
throwing
him
and
before
he
had
time
to
think
alan
had
slashed
down
with
the
knife
aiming
for
the
face
the
throat
the
lung
the
tip
landed
in
the
middle
of
his
bony
chest
and
skated
over
each
rib
going
tink
through
the
handle
like
a
xylophone
it
scored
along
the
emaciated
and
distended
belly
then
sank
in
just
to
one
side
of
the
smooth
patch
where
a
real
person
where
marci
would
have
a
navel
davey
howled
and
twisted
free
of
the
seeking
edge
skipping
back
three
steps
while
holding
in
the
loop
of
gut
that
was
trailing
free
of
the
incision
she
said
hurt
me
she
said
over
and
over
he
said
it
too
and
he
laughed
at
her
benny
chanted
it
at
him
standing
just
behind
him
and
the
sound
of
his
voice
filled
alan
ears
suddenly
davey
reeled
back
as
a
stone
rebounded
off
of
his
shoulder
they
both
looked
in
the
direction
it
had
come
from
and
saw
george
with
the
tail
of
his
shirt
aproned
before
him
filled
with
small
jagged
stones
from
the
edge
of
the
hot
spring
in
their
depths
they
took
turns
throwing
those
stones
skimming
them
over
the
water
and
ed
and
fred
and
george
had
a
vicious
arm
davey
turned
and
snarled
and
started
upslope
toward
george
and
a
stone
took
him
in
the
back
of
the
neck
thrown
by
freddie
who
had
sought
cover
behind
a
thick
pine
that
could
disguise
the
red
of
his
windbreaker
red
as
the
inside
of
his
lip
which
pouted
out
as
he
considered
his
next
toss
he
was
downslope
and
so
drew
was
able
to
bridge
the
distance
between
them
very
quickly
he
was
almost
upon
felix
when
a
third
stone
bigger
and
faster
than
the
others
took
him
in
the
back
of
the
head
with
terrible
speed
making
a
sound
like
a
hammer
missing
the
nail
and
hitting
solid
wood
instead
it
was
ernie
of
course
standing
on
craig
highest
point
winding
up
for
another
toss
the
threesome
second
volley
hit
him
all
at
once
from
three
sides
high
low
and
medium
killed
her
cut
her
up
buried
her
benny
chanted
sliced
her
open
and
cut
her
up
he
called
shut
up
davey
screamed
he
was
bleeding
from
the
back
of
his
head
the
blood
trickling
down
the
knobs
of
his
spine
and
he
was
crying
sobbing
killed
her
cut
her
up
sliced
her
open
chanted
in
unison
alan
tightened
his
grip
on
the
cords
wound
around
the
handle
of
his
knife
and
his
knife
hand
bled
from
the
puncture
wounds
left
by
teeth
davey
saw
him
coming
and
dropped
to
his
knees
crying
sobbing
please
he
said
holding
his
hands
out
before
him
palms
together
begging
please
he
said
as
the
loop
of
intestine
he
been
holding
in
trailed
free
please
he
said
as
alan
seized
him
by
the
hair
jerked
his
head
back
and
swiftly
brought
the
knife
across
his
throat
benny
took
his
knife
and
coaxed
clarence
into
a
slow
deep
fissuring
they
dragged
the
body
into
the
earthy
crack
and
clarence
swallowed
up
their
brother
benny
led
alan
to
the
cave
where
they
changed
his
bedding
and
laid
out
a
candy
bar
a
shopping
bag
filled
with
and
a
lock
of
marci
hair
tied
into
a
knot
alan
dragged
all
of
his
suitcases
up
from
the
basement
to
the
living
room
from
the
tiny
tin
valise
plastered
with
genuine
vintage
deco
railway
stickers
to
the
steamer
trunk
that
he
always
intended
to
refurbish
as
a
bathroom
cabinet
he
had
been
home
in
fifteen
years
what
should
he
bring
clothes
were
the
easiest
it
was
coming
up
on
the
cusp
of
july
and
august
and
he
remembered
boyhood
summers
on
the
mountain
slopes
abuzz
with
blackflies
and
syrupy
heat
white
lightweight
trousers
hiking
boots
that
breathed
a
thin
jacket
for
the
mosquitoes
at
dusk
he
decided
to
pack
four
changes
of
clothes
which
made
a
very
small
pile
on
the
sofa
small
suitcase
the
little
rolling
the
wheels
would
be
useless
on
the
rough
cave
floor
he
paced
and
looked
at
the
spines
of
his
books
and
paced
more
into
the
kitchen
it
was
a
beautiful
summer
day
and
the
tall
grasses
in
the
back
yard
nodded
in
the
soft
breeze
he
stepped
through
the
screen
door
and
out
into
the
garden
and
let
the
wild
grasses
scrape
over
his
thighs
ivy
and
wild
sunflowers
climbed
the
fence
that
separated
his
yard
from
his
neighbors
and
through
the
chinks
in
the
green
armor
he
saw
someone
moving
mimi
pacing
her
garden
neatly
tended
vegetable
beds
some
flowering
bulbs
skirt
and
a
cream
linen
blazer
that
rucked
up
over
her
shoulders
moving
restlessly
powerfully
alan
breath
caught
in
his
throat
her
pale
round
calves
flashed
in
the
sun
he
felt
himself
harden
painfully
he
must
have
gasped
or
given
some
sign
or
perhaps
she
heard
his
skin
tighten
over
his
body
into
a
great
goosepimply
mass
her
head
turned
their
eyes
met
and
he
jolted
he
was
frozen
in
his
footsteps
by
her
gaze
one
cheek
was
livid
with
a
purple
bruise
the
eye
above
it
slitted
and
puffed
she
took
a
step
toward
him
her
jacket
opening
to
reveal
a
shapeless
grey
sweatshirt
stained
with
food
and
blood
mimi
he
breathed
she
squeezed
her
eyes
shut
her
face
turning
into
a
fright
mask
abel
she
said
nice
day
are
you
all
right
he
said
he
had
his
girls
his
employees
show
up
for
work
in
this
state
before
he
knew
the
signs
is
he
in
the
house
now
she
pulled
up
a
corner
of
her
lip
into
a
sneer
and
he
saw
that
it
was
split
and
a
trickle
of
blood
wet
her
teeth
and
stained
them
pink
sleeping
she
said
he
swallowed
i
can
call
the
cops
or
a
shelter
or
both
she
laughed
i
gave
as
good
as
i
got
she
said
we
more
than
even
i
do
care
he
said
is
irrelevant
are
you
safe
as
houses
she
said
thanks
for
your
concern
she
turned
back
toward
her
back
door
wait
he
said
she
shrugged
and
the
wings
under
her
jacket
strained
against
the
fabric
she
reached
for
the
door
he
jammed
his
fingers
into
the
near
the
top
and
hauled
himself
scrambling
over
the
fence
landing
on
all
fours
in
a
splintering
of
tomato
plants
and
sticks
he
got
to
his
feet
and
bridged
the
distance
between
them
i
do
believe
you
mimi
he
said
i
do
believe
you
come
over
to
my
place
and
let
me
get
you
a
cup
of
coffee
and
an
ice
pack
and
talk
about
it
please
fuck
off
she
said
tugging
at
the
door
he
wedged
his
toe
in
it
took
her
wrist
gently
please
she
said
we
wake
him
come
over
he
said
we
wo
wake
him
she
cracked
her
arm
like
a
whip
shaking
his
hand
off
her
wrist
she
stared
at
him
out
of
her
swollen
eye
and
he
felt
the
jolt
again
some
recognition
some
shock
some
mirror
his
face
tiny
and
distorted
in
her
eye
she
shivered
help
me
over
the
fence
she
said
pulling
her
skirt
between
her
knees
bruise
on
her
thigh
and
tucking
it
behind
her
into
her
waistband
she
jammed
her
bare
toes
into
the
link
and
he
gripped
one
hard
straining
calf
in
one
hand
and
put
the
other
on
her
padded
soft
bottom
helping
her
up
onto
a
perch
atop
the
fence
he
scrambled
over
and
then
took
one
bare
foot
one
warm
calf
and
guided
her
down
come
inside
he
said
she
never
been
in
his
house
natalie
and
link
went
in
and
out
to
use
his
bathroom
while
they
were
enjoying
the
sunset
on
his
porch
or
to
get
a
beer
but
mimi
had
never
crossed
his
threshold
when
she
did
it
felt
like
something
he
been
missing
there
had
been
finally
found
she
looked
around
with
a
hint
of
a
smile
on
her
puffed
lips
she
ran
her
fingers
over
the
gas
range
he
restored
caressing
the
bakelite
knobs
she
peered
at
the
titles
of
the
books
in
the
kitchen
bookcases
over
the
honey
wood
of
the
mismatched
chairs
and
the
scars
of
the
big
simple
table
come
into
the
living
room
alan
said
i
get
you
an
ice
pack
she
let
him
guide
her
by
the
elbow
then
crossed
decisively
to
the
windows
and
drew
the
curtains
bringing
on
twilight
he
moved
aside
his
piles
of
clothes
and
stacked
up
the
suitcases
in
a
corner
going
somewhere
to
see
my
family
he
said
she
smiled
and
her
lip
cracked
anew
dripping
a
single
dark
droplet
of
blood
onto
the
gleaming
wood
of
the
floor
where
it
beaded
like
water
on
wax
paper
home
again
home
again
jiggety
jig
she
said
her
nearly
closed
eye
was
bright
and
it
darted
around
the
room
taking
in
shelves
fireplace
chairs
clothes
i
get
you
that
ice
pack
he
said
as
he
went
back
into
the
kitchen
he
heard
her
walking
around
in
the
living
room
and
he
remembered
the
first
time
he
met
her
of
walking
around
her
living
room
and
thinking
about
slipping
a
vcd
into
his
pocket
he
found
her
halfway
up
the
staircase
with
one
of
the
shallow
cabinets
open
before
her
she
was
holding
a
tin
robot
the
paint
crazed
with
age
into
craquelaire
like
a
dutch
master
painting
in
a
gallery
turn
it
upside
down
he
said
she
looked
at
him
then
turned
it
over
revealing
the
insides
of
the
tin
revealing
the
gaudily
printed
label
from
the
original
can
that
it
had
been
fashioned
from
huh
she
said
and
peered
down
into
it
he
hit
the
light
switch
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
so
that
she
could
see
better
beautiful
she
said
have
it
he
said
surprising
himself
he
have
to
remove
it
from
the
inventory
he
restrained
himself
from
going
upstairs
and
doing
it
before
he
forgot
for
the
first
time
he
could
remember
she
looked
flustered
her
unbruised
cheek
went
crimson
i
could
she
said
it
yours
he
said
he
went
up
the
stairs
and
closed
the
cabinet
then
folded
her
fingers
around
the
robot
and
led
her
by
the
wrist
back
down
to
the
sofa
ice
pack
he
said
handing
it
to
her
releasing
her
wrist
she
sat
in
on
the
sofa
the
hump
of
her
wings
behind
her
keeping
her
from
reclining
she
caught
him
staring
it
time
to
trim
them
she
said
oh
yes
he
said
mind
going
back
to
the
gridwork
of
old
scars
by
her
shoulders
when
they
get
too
big
i
ca
sit
properly
or
lie
on
my
back
at
least
not
while
i
wearing
a
shirt
could
you
i
do
know

the
back
out
of
a
shirt
yeah
she
said
or

or

a
halter
but
not
in
public
no
not
in
public
secrets

be
kept
you

a
lot
of
secrets

she
said
some
he
said
deep
dark
ones
all
secrets
become
deep
all
secrets
become
dark
that
in
the
nature
of
secrets
she
pressed
the
bag
of
ice
to
her
face
and
rolled
her
head
back
and
forth
on
her
neck
he
heard
pops
and
crackles
as
her
muscles
and
vertebrae
unlimbered
hang
on
he
said
he
ran
up
to
his
room
and
dug
through
his
drawer
until
he
found
one
that
he
did
mind
parting
with
he
brought
it
back
downstairs
and
held
it
up
for
her
to
see
steel
pole
bathtub
he
said
retro
chic
i
can
cut
the
back
out
for
you
at
least
while
you
here
she
closed
her
eyes
i
like
that
she
said
in
a
small
voice
so
he
got
his
kitchen
shears
and
went
to
work
on
the
back
of
the
shirt
cutting
a
sizable
hole
in
the
back
of
the
fabric
he
folded
duct
tape
around
the
ragged
edges
to
keep
them
from
fraying
she
watched
bemusedly
freakshow
martha
stewart
she
said
he
smiled
and
passed
her
the
shirt
i
give
you
some
privacy
he
said
and
went
back
into
the
kitchen
and
put
away
the
shears
and
the
tape
he
tried
not
to
listen
to
the
soft
rustle
of
clothing
in
the
other
room
alan
she
said
and
not
or
i
could
use
some
help
he
stepped
cautiously
into
the
living
room
and
saw
there
in
the
curtained
twilight
mimi
she
was
topless
heavy
breasts
marked
red
with
the
outline
of
her
bra
straps
and
wires
they
hung
weightily
swaying
and
stopped
him
in
the
doorway
she
had
her
arms
lifted
over
her
head
tugging
her
round
belly
up
stretching
her
navel
into
a
slit
the
he
given
her
was
tangled
in
her
arms
and
in
her
wings
her
magnificent
wings
they
were
four
feet
long
each
and
they
stretched
one
through
the
neck
hole
and
the
other
through
the
hole
he
cut
in
the
back
they
were
leathery
as
he
remembered
covered
in
a
downy
fur
that
glowed
where
it
was
kissed
by
the
few
shafts
of
light
piercing
the
gap
in
the
drapes
he
reached
for
the
questing
almost
prehensile
tip
of
the
one
that
was
caught
in
the
neck
hole
it
was
muscular
like
a
strong
finger
curling
against
his
palm
like
a
masonic
handshake
when
he
touched
her
wing
she
gasped
and
shivered
indeterminately
between
erotic
and
outraged
they
were
as
he
imagined
them
these
wings
strong
and
primal
and
dark
and
like
an
armpit
after
sex
he
gently
guided
the
tip
down
toward
the
neck
hole
and
marveled
at
the
intricate
way
that
it
folded
in
on
itself
at
the
play
of
mysterious
muscle
and
cartilage
the
rustle
of
bristling
hair
and
the
motility
of
the
skin
it
accordioned
down
and
he
tugged
the
shirt
around
it
so
that
it
came
free
and
then
he
slid
the
front
of
the
shirt
down
over
her
breasts
painfully
aware
of
his
erection
as
the
fabric
rustled
down
over
her
rounded
belly
as
her
head
emerged
through
the
shirt
she
shook
her
hair
out
and
then
unfolded
her
wings
slowly
and
exquisitely
like
a
cat
stretching
out
bending
forward
spreading
them
like
sails
he
ducked
beneath
one
feeling
its
puff
of
spiced
air
on
his
face
and
found
himself
staring
at
the
hash
of
scars
and
the
rigid
ropes
of
hyperextended
muscle
and
joints
tentatively
he
traced
the
scars
with
his
thumbs
then
when
she
made
no
move
to
stop
him
he
dug
his
thumbs
into
the
muscles
into
their
tension
he
kneaded
at
her
flesh
grinding
hard
at
the
knots
and
feeling
them
give
way
briskly
rubbing
the
spots
where
they
been
to
get
the
blood
going
her
wings
flapped
gently
around
him
as
he
worked
not
caring
that
his
body
was
pretzeled
into
a
knot
of
its
own
to
reach
her
back
since
he
did
want
to
break
the
spell
to
ask
her
to
move
over
to
give
him
a
better
angle
he
could
smell
her
armpit
and
her
wings
and
her
hair
and
he
closed
his
eyes
and
worked
by
touch
following
scar
to
muscle
muscle
to
knot
working
his
way
the
length
and
breadth
of
her
back
following
the
muscle
up
from
the
ridge
of
her
iliac
crest
like
a
treasure
trail
to
the
muscle
of
her
left
wing
which
was
softly
twitching
with
pleasure
she
went
perfectly
still
again
when
he
took
the
wing
in
his
hands
it
had
its
own
geometry
hard
to
understand
and
irresistible
he
followed
the
mysterious
and
powerful
muscles
and
bones
the
vast
expanses
of
cartilage
finding
knots
and
squeezing
them
kneading
her
as
kneaded
her
back
and
she
groaned
and
went
limp
leaning
back
against
him
so
that
his
face
was
in
her
hair
and
smelling
her
scalp
oil
and
stale
shampoo
and
sweat
it
was
all
he
could
do
to
keep
himself
from
burying
his
face
in
her
hair
and
gnawing
at
the
muscles
at
the
base
of
her
skull
he
moved
as
slow
as
a
seaweed
and
ran
his
hands
over
to
her
other
wing
giving
it
the
same
treatment
he
was
pressed
against
her
her
wings
all
around
him
he
traced
the
line
of
her
jaw
to
her
chin
and
they
were
breathing
in
unison
and
his
fingers
found
the
tense
place
at
the
hinge
and
worked
there
too
then
he
brushed
against
her
bruised
cheek
and
she
startled
and
that
shocked
him
back
to
reality
he
dropped
his
hands
to
his
sides
and
then
stood
realized
his
erection
was
straining
at
his
shorts
sat
back
down
again
in
one
of
the
club
chairs
and
crossed
his
legs
well
he
said
mimi
unfolded
her
wings
over
the
and
let
them
spread
out
then
leaned
back
eyes
closed
you
should
try
the
again
he
said
weakly
she
groped
blindly
for
it
and
draped
it
over
her
face
thank
you
she
sighed
he
suppressed
the
urge
to
apologize
you
welcome
he
said
it
started
last
week
she
said
my
wings
had
gotten
longer
too
long
krishna
came
home
from
the
club
and
he
was
drunk
and
he
wanted
sex
wanted
me
on
the
bottom
i
could
my
wings
he
wanted
to
get
the
knife
right
away
and
cut
them
off
we
do
it
about
four
times
a
year
using
a
big
serrated
hunting
knife
he
bought
at
a
store
on
yonge
street
one
of
those
places
that
sells
dud
grenades
and
camou
pants
and
tasers
she
opened
her
eyes
and
looked
at
him
then
closed
them
he
shivered
and
a
goose
walked
over
his
grave
we
do
it
in
the
tub
i
stand
in
the
tub
naked
and
he
saws
off
the
wings
right
to
my
shoulders
i
do
bleed
much
he
gives
me
a
towel
to
bite
on
while
he
cuts
to
scream
into
and
then
we
put
them
in
garden
trash
bags
and
he
puts
them
out
just
before
the
garbage
men
arrive
so
the
neighborhood
dogs
do
get
at
them
for
the
meat
he
noticed
that
he
was
gripping
the
arm
rests
so
tightly
that
his
hands
were
cramping
he
pried
them
loose
and
tucked
them
under
his
thighs
he
dragged
me
into
the
bathroom
one
second
we
were
rolling
around
in
bed
giggling
like
kids
in
love
and
then
he
had
me
so
hard
by
the
wrist
dragging
me
naked
to
the
bathroom
his
knife
in
his
other
fist
i
had
to
keep
quiet
so
that
i
would
wake
link
and
natalie
but
he
was
hurting
me
and
i
was
scared
i
tried
to
say
something
to
him
but
i
could
only
squeak
he
hurled
me
into
the
tub
and
i
cracked
my
head
against
the
tile
i
cried
out
and
he
crossed
the
bathroom
and
put
his
hand
over
my
mouth
and
nose
and
then
i
could
breathe
and
my
head
was
swimming
he
was
naked
and
hard
and
he
had
the
knife
in
his
fist
not
like
for
slicing
but
for
stabbing
and
his
eyes
were
red
from
the
smoke
at
the
club
and
the
bathroom
filled
with
the
smell
and
i
sank
down
in
the
tub
shrinking
away
from
him
as
he
grabbed
for
me
he
saw
that
i
was
staring
at
the
knife
smiled
horribly
there
a
piece
of
granite
we
use
for
a
soap
dish
balanced
in
the
corner
of
the
tub
without
thinking
i
grabbed
it
and
threw
it
as
hard
as
i
could
at
him
it
broke
his
nose
and
he
closed
his
eyes
and
reached
for
his
face
and
i
wrapped
him
up
in
the
shower
curtain
and
grabbed
his
arm
and
bit
at
the
base
of
his
thumb
so
hard
i
heard
a
bone
break
and
he
dropped
the
knife
i
grabbed
it
and
ran
back
to
our
room
and
threw
it
out
the
window
and
started
to
get
dressed
she
fallen
into
a
monotone
now
but
her
wingtips
twitched
and
her
knees
bounced
like
her
motor
was
idling
on
high
she
jiggled
you
do
have
to
tell
me
this
he
said
she
took
off
the
ice
pack
yes
i
do
she
said
her
eyes
seemed
to
have
sunk
into
her
skull
vanishing
into
dark
pits
he
thought
her
eyes
were
blue
or
green
but
they
looked
black
now
all
right
he
said
all
right
she
said
he
came
through
the
door
and
i
did
scream
i
did
want
to
wake
up
link
and
natalie
is
that
stupid
but
i
could
get
my
sweatshirt
on
and
they
would
have
seen
my
wings
he
looked
like
he
was
going
to
kill
me
really
hands
in
claws
teeth
out
crouched
down
low
like
a
chimp
ready
to
grab
ready
to
swing
and
i
was
back
in
a
corner
again
just
wearing
track
pants
he
did
have
the
knife
this
time
though
when
he
came
for
me
i
went
limp
like
i
was
too
scared
to
move
and
squeezed
my
eyes
shut
listened
to
his
footsteps
approach
felt
the
creak
of
the
bed
as
he
stepped
up
on
it
felt
his
breath
as
he
reached
for
me
i
exploded
i
read
books
on
women
and
they
talk
about
doing
that
about
exploding
you
gather
in
all
your
energy
and
squeeze
it
tight
and
then
blamo
boom
you
explode
i
was
aiming
for
his
soft
parts
balls
eyes
nose
sternum
ears
i
misjudged
where
he
was
though
so
i
missed
most
of
my
targets
and
then
he
was
on
me
kneeling
on
my
tits
hands
at
my
throat
i
bucked
him
but
i
could
get
him
off
my
chest
and
throat
were
crushed
my
wings
splayed
out
behind
me
i
flapped
them
and
saw
his
hair
move
in
the
breeze
he
was
sweating
hard
off
his
forehead
and
off
his
nose
and
lips
it
was
all
so
detailed
and
silent
neither
of
us
made
a
sound
louder
than
a
grunt
quieter
than
our
sex
noises
i
wanted
to
scream
to
wake
up
link
and
natalie
but
i
could
get
a
breath
i
worked
one
hand
free
and
i
reached
for
the
erection
that
i
could
feel
just
below
my
tits
reached
as
fast
as
a
striking
snake
grabbed
it
grabbed
his
balls
and
i
yanked
and
i
squeezed
like
i
was
trying
to
tear
them
off
i
was
now
was
trying
to
get
away
and
i
had
him
cornered
i
kept
squeezing
that
when
he
kicked
me
in
the
face
i
was
dazed
he
kicked
me
twice
more
and
i
ran
downstairs
and
got
a
parka
from
the
closet
and
ran
out
into
the
front
yard
and
out
to
the
park
and
hid
in
the
bushes
until
morning
he
was
asleep
when
i
came
back
in
after
natalie
and
link
had
gone
out
i
found
the
knife
beside
the
house
and
i
went
up
to
our
room
and
i
stood
there
by
the
window
listening
to
you
talk
to
them
holding
the
knife
she
plumped
herself
on
the
cushions
and
flapped
her
wings
once
softly
another
puff
of
that
warm
air
wafting
over
him
she
picked
up
the
tin
robot
he
given
her
from
the
coffee
table
and
turned
it
over
in
her
hands
staring
up
its
skirts
at
the
illustration
and
the
japanese
ideograms
i
had
the
knife
and
i
felt
like
i
had
to
use
it
you
know
chekhov
a
gun
is
on
the
mantle
in
the
first
act
it
must
go
off
in
the
third
i
write
plays
wrote
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
knife
had
been
in
act
one
when
krishna
dragged
me
into
the
bathroom
or
maybe
act
one
was
when
he
brought
it
home
after
i
showed
him
my
wings
and
act
two
had
been
my
night
in
the
park
and
act
three
was
then
standing
over
him
with
the
knife
cold
and
sore
and
tired
looking
at
the
blood
crusted
on
his
face
her
face
and
her
voice
got
very
very
small
her
expression
distant
i
almost
used
it
on
myself
i
almost
opened
my
wrists
onto
his
face
he
liked
it
when
i
rode
his
face
like
the
hot
juices
seemed
to
spill
all
that
hot
juice
and
deny
him
that
pleasure
i
thought
about
using
it
on
him
too
but
only
for
a
second
only
for
a
second
and
then
he
rolled
over
and
his
hands
clenched
into
fists
in
his
sleep
and
his
expression
changed
like
he
was
dreaming
about
something
that
made
him
angry
so
i
left
do
you
want
to
know
about
when
i
first
showed
him
these
she
said
and
flapped
her
wings
lazily
she
took
the
ice
pack
from
her
face
and
he
could
see
that
the
swelling
had
gone
down
the
discoloration
faded
to
a
dim
shadow
tinged
with
yellows
and
umbers
he
did
but
he
did
the
breeze
of
her
great
wings
was
strangely
intimate
that
smell
more
intimate
than
his
touches
or
the
moment
in
which
he
glimpsed
her
fine
weighty
breasts
with
their
texture
of
stretch
marks
and
underwire
grooves
he
was
awkward
foolish
feeling
i
do
think
i
do
he
said
at
last
i
think
that
we
should
save
some
things
to
tell
each
other
for
later
she
blinked
slow
and
lazy
and
one
tear
rolled
down
and
dripped
off
her
nose
splashing
on
the
red
and
darkening
it
to
wineish
purple
will
you
sit
with
me
she
said
he
crossed
the
room
and
sat
on
the
other
end
of
the
sofa
his
hand
on
the
seam
that
joined
the
two
halves
together
crossing
the
border
into
her
territory
an
invitation
that
could
be
refused
without
awkwardness
she
covered
his
hand
with
hers
and
hers
was
cold
and
smooth
but
not
distant
immediate
scritching
and
twitching
against
his
skin
slowly
slowly
she
leaned
toward
him
curling
her
wing
round
his
far
shoulder
like
a
blanket
or
a
lover
arm
head
coming
to
rest
on
his
chest
breath
hot
on
his
nipple
through
the
thin
fabric
of
his
alan
she
murmured
into
his
chest
yes
what
are
we
she
said
huh
are
we
human
where
do
we
come
from
how
did
we
get
here
why
do
i
have
wings
he
closed
his
eyes
and
found
that
they
welled
up
with
tears
once
the
first
tear
slid
down
his
cheek
the
rest
came
and
he
was
crying
weeping
silently
at
first
and
then
braying
like
a
donkey
in
sobs
that
started
in
his
balls
and
emerged
from
his
throat
like
vomit
gushing
out
with
hot
tears
and
hot
snot
mimi
enveloped
him
in
her
wings
and
kissed
his
tears
away
working
down
his
cheeks
to
his
neck
his
adam
apple
he
snuffled
back
a
mouthful
of
mucus
and
salt
and
wailed
i
know
she
snugged
her
mouth
up
against
his
collarbone
krishna
does
she
whispered
into
his
skin
she
tugged
at
the
skin
with
her
teeth
what
about
your
family
he
swallowed
a
couple
of
times
painfully
aware
of
her
lips
and
breath
on
his
skin
the
enveloping
coolth
of
her
wings
and
the
smell
in
every
breath
he
took
he
wanted
to
blow
his
nose
but
he
could
move
without
breaking
the
spell
so
he
hoarked
his
sinuses
back
into
his
throat
and
drank
the
oozing
oyster
of
that
slid
down
his
throat
my
family
i
do
have
a
family
but
you
do
she
said
your
family
must
know
they
do
he
said
maybe
you
have
asked
them
properly
when
are
you
leaving
today
driving
got
a
rental
car
he
said
room
for
one
more
yes
he
said
then
take
me
she
said
all
right
he
said
she
raised
her
head
and
kissed
him
on
the
lips
and
he
could
taste
the
smell
now
and
the
blood
roared
in
his
ears
as
she
straddled
his
lap
grinding
her
mons
hot
through
the
thin
cotton
of
her
skirt
against
him
they
slid
down
on
the
sofa
and
they
groaned
into
each
others
mouths
his
voice
box
resonating
with
hers
he
parked
the
rental
car
in
the
driveway
finishing
his
cell
phone
conversation
with
lyman
and
then
popping
the
trunk
before
getting
out
he
glanced
reflexively
up
at
mimi
and
krishna
windows
saw
the
blinds
were
still
drawn
when
he
got
to
the
living
room
mimi
was
bent
over
a
suitcase
forcing
it
closed
two
more
were
lined
up
beside
the
door
along
with
three
shopping
bags
filled
with
tupperwares
and
ziplocs
of
food
from
his
fridge
i
borrowed
some
of
your
clothes
she
said
did
want
to
have
to
go
back
for
mine
packed
us
a
picnic
too
he
planted
his
hands
on
his
hips
you
thought
of
everything
huh
he
said
she
cast
her
eyes
down
i
sorry
she
said
in
a
small
voice
i
could
go
home
her
wings
unfolded
and
folded
down
again
nervously
he
went
and
stood
next
to
her
he
could
still
smell
the
sex
on
her
and
on
him
a
livid
hickey
stood
out
on
her
soft
skin
on
her
throat
he
twined
her
fingers
in
his
and
dropped
his
face
down
to
her
ear
it
okay
he
said
huskily
i
glad
you
did
it
she
turned
her
head
and
brushed
her
lips
over
his
brushed
her
hand
over
his
groin
he
groaned
softly
we
have
to
get
driving
he
said
yes
she
said
load
the
car
then
bring
it
around
the
side
i
lie
down
on
the
back
seat
until
we
out
of
the
neighborhood
you
thought
about
this
a
lot
huh
it
all
i
thought
of
she
said
she
climbed
over
the
back
seat
once
they
cleared
queen
street
giggling
as
her
wings
trapped
under
her
jacket
brushed
the
roof
of
the
big
crown
victoria
he
rented
she
prodded
at
the
radio
and
found
a
college
station
staticky
and
amateurish
and
nodded
her
head
along
with
the
mixes
and
concert
bootlegs
the
dj
was
spinning
alan
watched
her
in
the
rearview
and
felt
impossibly
old
and
strange
she
been
an
incredible
and
attentive
lover
using
her
hands
and
mouth
her
breasts
and
wings
her
whole
body
to
keep
him
quivering
on
the
brink
of
orgasm
for
what
felt
like
hours
before
finally
giving
him
release
and
then
had
guided
him
around
her
body
with
explicit
instructions
and
firm
hands
on
his
shoulders
when
she
came
she
squeezed
him
between
her
thighs
and
screamed
into
his
neck
twitching
and
shuddering
for
a
long
time
afterward
holding
him
tight
murmuring
nonsense
and
hot
breath
in
the
dark
she
seemed
older
his
age
or
some
indeterminate
age
now
sitting
next
to
him
privately
spazzing
out
to
the
beat
she
seemed
oh
or
so
a
little
girl
he
felt
dirty
where
are
we
going
she
said
rolling
down
the
window
and
shouting
over
the
wind
as
they
bombed
up
the
don
valley
parkway
the
traffic
had
let
up
at
sheppard
and
now
they
were
making
good
time
heading
for
the
faceless
surburbs
of
richmond
hill
and
thornhill
and
beyond
north
he
said
past
kapuskasing
she
whistled
how
long
a
drive
is
it
fifteen
hours
twenty
maybe
depends
on
the
roads
you
can
hit
cottage
traffic
or
a
bad
accident
and
get
hung
up
for
hours
there
are
good
motels
between
huntsville
and
north
bay
if
we
get
tired
out
nice
neon
signs
magic
fingers
beds
a
place
i
like
has
cabins
and
makes
a
nice
rosti
for
dinner
god
that
a
long
trip
she
said
yeah
he
said
wondering
if
she
wanted
out
i
can
pull
off
here
and
give
you
cab
fare
to
the
subway
station
if
you
wan
na
stay
no
she
said
quickly
no
want
to
go
she
fed
him
as
he
drove
slicing
cheese
and
putting
it
on
crackers
with
bits
of
olive
or
pepper
or
salami
it
appeared
that
she
packed
his
entire
fridge
in
the
picnic
bags
after
suppertime
she
went
to
work
on
an
apple
and
he
took
a
closer
look
at
the
knife
she
was
using
it
was
a
big
black
hunting
knife
with
a
compass
built
into
the
handle
the
blade
was
black
except
right
at
the
edge
where
it
gleamed
sharp
in
the
of
the
passing
highway
lights
he
was
transfixed
by
it
and
the
car
drifted
a
little
sprayed
gravel
from
the
shoulder
and
he
overcorrected
and
fishtailed
a
little
she
looked
up
in
alarm
you
brought
the
knife
he
said
in
response
to
her
unasked
question
could
leave
it
with
him
she
said
besides
a
sharp
knife
is
handy
careful
you
do
slice
anything
off
okay
i
never
cut
anything
she
said
in
a
voice
and
socked
him
in
the
shoulder
he
snorted
and
went
back
to
the
driving
putting
the
hammer
down
eating
up
the
kilometers
toward
huntsville
and
beyond
she
fed
him
slices
of
apple
and
ate
some
herself
then
rolls
of
ham
with
little
pieces
of
pear
in
them
then
sips
of
cherry
juice
from
a
glass
bottle
enough
he
said
at
last
i
stuffed
woman
she
laughed
skinny
little
fucker
got
ta
put
some
meat
on
your
bones
she
tidied
the
dinner
detritus
into
an
empty
shopping
bag
and
tossed
it
over
her
shoulder
into
the
back
seat
so
she
said
how
long
since
you
been
home
he
stared
at
the
road
for
a
while
fifteen
years
he
said
never
been
back
since
i
left
she
stared
straight
forward
and
worked
her
hand
under
his
thigh
so
he
was
sitting
on
it
then
wriggled
her
knuckles
i
never
been
home
she
said
he
wrinkled
his
brow
what
that
mean
he
said
it
a
long
story
she
said
well
let
get
off
the
highway
and
get
a
room
and
you
can
tell
me
okay
sure
she
said
they
ended
up
at
the
timberline
wilderness
lodge
and
pancake
house
and
mimi
clapped
her
hands
at
the
ambience
of
the
room
fondled
the
grisly
jackalope
head
on
the
wall
and
started
running
a
tub
while
alan
carried
in
the
suitcases
she
dramatically
tossed
her
clothes
one
item
at
a
time
out
the
bathroom
door
through
the
clouds
of
steam
and
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
round
full
ass
bracketed
by
her
restless
wings
as
she
poured
into
the
tub
the
bottle
of
cheap
she
bought
in
the
lobby
he
dug
a
and
a
fresh
pair
of
boxers
to
sleep
in
out
of
his
suitcase
feeling
ridiculously
modest
as
he
donned
them
his
feet
crunched
over
cigarette
burns
and
tangles
in
the
brown
shag
carpet
and
he
wished
he
brought
along
some
slippers
he
flipped
through
both
snowy
tv
channels
and
decided
that
he
could
stomach
a
televangelist
or
a
sitcom
right
then
and
flicked
it
off
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
listening
to
the
splashing
from
the
bathroom
mimi
was
in
awfully
good
spirits
considering
what
she
been
through
with
krishna
he
tried
to
think
about
it
trying
to
make
sense
of
the
day
and
the
girl
but
the
splashing
from
the
tub
kept
intruding
on
his
thoughts
she
began
to
sing
and
after
a
second
he
recognized
the
tune
white
rabbit
by
the
jefferson
airplane
not
the
kind
of
thing
he
expect
her
to
be
giving
voice
to
nor
she
apparently
for
she
kept
breaking
off
to
giggle
finally
he
poked
his
head
through
the
door
she
was
folded
into
the
tub
knees
and
tits
above
the
foamline
wings
slick
with
water
and
dripping
in
the
tile
her
hands
were
out
of
sight
beneath
the
suds
she
caught
his
eye
and
grinned
crazily
then
her
hands
shot
out
of
the
pool
clutching
the
hunting
knife
on
the
white
rabbit
she
howled
cackling
fiendishly
he
leapt
back
and
she
continued
to
cackle
come
back
come
back
she
choked
i
doing
the
tub
scene
from
and
loathing
in
las
i
thought
you
were
into
reading
he
cautiously
peeked
around
the
doorjamb
playing
it
up
for
comic
effect
give
me
the
knife
he
said
awww
she
said
handing
it
over
butt
first
he
set
it
down
on
the
dresser
then
hurried
back
to
the
bathroom
have
you
read
all
those
books
alan
grinned
what
the
point
of
a
bunch
of
books
you
already
read
he
dropped
his
boxers
and
stripped
off
his
and
climbed
into
the
tub
sloshing
gallons
of
water
over
the
scummy
tile
floor
when
i
was
two
years
old
she
said
later
as
she
reclined
against
the
headboard
and
he
reclined
against
her
their
asses
deforming
the
rusted
springs
of
the
mattress
so
that
it
sloped
toward
them
and
the
tins
of
soda
they
opened
to
replenish
their
bodily
fluids
lost
in
sweat
and
otherwise
threatened
to
tip
over
on
the
slope
she
encased
him
in
her
wings
shutting
out
the
light
and
filling
their
air
with
the
smell
of
cinnamon
and
pepper
from
the
downy
hair
when
i
was
two
years
old
she
said
speaking
into
the
shaggy
hair
at
the
back
of
his
neck
as
his
sore
muscles
trembled
and
as
the
sweat
dried
to
a
white
salt
residue
on
his
skin
as
he
lay
there
in
the
dark
of
the
room
and
the
wings
watching
the
constellation
of
reflected
lights
in
the
black
tv
screen
when
i
was
two
years
old
she
began
her
body
tensing
from
toes
to
tip
in
a
movement
that
he
felt
along
the
length
of
his
body
portending
the
time
when
lovers
close
their
eyes
and
open
their
mouths
and
utter
the
secrets
that
they
hide
from
everyone
even
themselves
when
i
was
two
years
old
my
wings
were
the
size
of
a
cherub
and
they
had
featherlets
that
were
white
as
snow
i
lived
with
my
aunt
an
old
russian
lady
near
downsview
air
force
base
a
blasted
suburb
where
the
shops
all
closed
on
saturday
for
sabbath
and
the
hasids
marked
the
days
by
walking
from
one
end
to
the
other
on
their
way
to
temple
the
old
russian
lady
took
me
out
for
walks
in
a
big
black
baby
buggy
the
size
of
a
bathtub
she
tucked
me
in
tight
so
that
my
wings
were
pinned
beneath
me
but
when
we
were
at
home
in
her
little
apartment
with
the
sputnik
that
played
the
internationale
she
would
let
my
wings
out
and
light
the
candles
and
watch
me
wobble
around
the
room
my
wings
flapping
her
chin
in
her
hands
her
eyes
bright
she
made
me
mashed
up
cabbage
and
seed
and
beef
and
bottles
of
dilute
juice
for
dessert
we
had
hard
candies
and
i
toddle
around
with
my
toys
drooling
sugar
syrup
while
the
old
russian
lady
watched
by
the
time
i
was
four
the
feathers
had
all
fallen
out
and
i
was
supposed
to
go
to
school
i
knew
that
auntie
had
explained
to
me
that
the
kids
that
i
saw
passing
by
were
on
their
way
to
school
and
that
go
some
day
and
learn
too
she
did
speak
much
english
so
i
grew
up
speaking
a
creole
of
russian
ukrainian
polish
and
english
and
i
used
my
words
to
ask
her
with
more
and
more
insistence
when
i
get
to
go
to
class
i
could
read
or
write
and
neither
could
she
but
i
could
take
apart
gadgets
like
nobody
business
someone
maybe
auntie
long
dead
husband
had
left
her
a
junky
tool
kit
with
cracked
handles
and
chipped
tips
and
i
attacked
anything
that
i
could
get
unplugged
from
the
wall
the
big
cabinet
tv
and
radio
the
suitcase
record
player
the
sputnik
music
box
i
unwired
the
lamps
and
peered
at
the
workings
of
the
electric
kitchen
clock
that
was
four
five
was
the
year
i
put
it
all
back
together
again
i
started
with
the
lamps
then
the
motor
in
the
blender
then
the
toaster
elements
i
made
the
old
tv
work
i
do
think
i
knew
how
any
of
it
worked
could
tell
you
a
thing
about
you
know
electrical
engineering
but
i
just
got
a
sense
of
how
it
was
to
go
together
auntie
did
let
me
out
of
the
apartment
after
five
i
could
watch
the
kids
go
by
from
the
window
skinny
hasids
with
and
filipinos
with
pretty
ribbons
and
teenagers
who
smoked
but
i
go
to
them
i
watched
and
and
i
began
to
soak
up
english
i
began
to
soak
up
the
idea
of
playing
with
other
kids
i
began
to
soak
up
the
fact
that
none
of
the
kids
on
the
tv
had
wings
auntie
left
me
alone
in
the
afternoons
while
she
went
out
shopping
and
banking
and
whatever
else
it
was
she
did
and
it
was
during
those
times
that
i
could
get
myself
into
her
bedroom
and
go
rooting
around
her
things
she
had
a
lot
of
mysterious
beige
foundation
garments
that
were
utterly
inexplicable
and
a
little
box
of
jewelry
that
i
liked
to
taste
because
the
real
gold
tasted
really
rich
when
i
sucked
on
it
and
a
stack
of
old
cigarette
tins
full
of
frayed
photos
the
pictures
were
stiff
and
mysterious
faces
loomed
out
of
featureless
black
backgrounds
russian
farm
boys
awkward
farm
girls
with
process
waves
in
their
hair
everyone
looking
like
been
stuffed
and
mounted
i
guess
they
were
her
relatives
because
if
you
squinted
at
them
and
cocked
your
head
you
could
kind
of
see
her
features
in
theirs
but
not
saggy
and
wrinkled
and
but
young
and
tight
and
almost
glowing
they
all
had
big
shoulders
and
clothing
that
looked
like
the
kind
of
thing
the
hasids
wore
black
and
sober
the
faces
were
interesting
especially
after
i
figured
out
that
one
of
them
might
belong
to
auntie
but
it
was
the
blackness
around
them
that
fascinated
me
the
boys
had
black
suits
and
the
girls
wore
black
dresses
and
behind
them
was
creased
blackness
complete
darkness
as
though
they
put
their
heads
through
a
black
curtain
but
the
more
i
stared
at
the
blackness
the
more
detail
i
picked
out
i
noticed
the
edge
of
a
curtain
a
fold
in
one
photo
and
when
i
looked
for
it
i
could
just
pick
it
out
in
the
other
photos
eventually
i
hit
on
the
idea
of
using
a
water
glass
as
a
magnifying
lens
and
as
i
experimented
with
different
levels
of
water
more
detail
leapt
out
of
the
old
pictures
the
curtains
hanging
behind
them
were
dusty
and
wrinkled
they
looked
like
they
were
made
of
crushed
velvet
like
the
niagara
falls
souvenir
pillow
on
auntie
armchair
in
the
living
room
which
had
whorls
of
paisley
trimmed
into
them
i
traced
these
whorls
with
my
eye
and
tried
to
reproduce
them
with
a
ballpoint
on
paper
bags
i
found
under
the
sink
and
then
in
one
of
the
photos
i
noticed
that
the
patterns
disappeared
behind
and
above
the
shoulders
i
experimented
with
different
water
levels
in
my
glass
to
bring
up
the
magnification
and
i
diligently
sketched
i
seen
a
dot
episode
where
the
hosts
showed
how
you
could
draw
a
grid
over
an
original
image
and
a
matching
grid
on
a
sheet
of
blank
paper
and
then
copy
over
every
square
reproducing
the
image
in
manageable
chunks
that
what
i
did
using
the
edge
of
a
nail
file
for
a
ruler
drawing
my
grid
carefully
on
the
paper
bag
and
a
matching
one
on
the
picture
using
the
blunt
tip
of
a
dead
pen
to
make
a
grid
of
indentations
in
the
surface
of
the
photo
and
i
sketched
it
out
one
square
at
a
time
where
the
pattern
was
where
it
was
what
shapes
the
negative
took
in
the
photos
as
i
drew
day
after
day
i
realized
that
i
was
drawing
the
shape
of
something
black
that
was
blocking
the
curtain
behind
then
i
got
excited
i
drew
in
my
steadiest
hand
tracing
each
curve
using
my
magnifier
until
i
had
the
shape
drawn
and
defined
and
long
before
i
finished
i
knew
what
i
was
drawing
and
i
drew
it
anyway
i
drew
it
and
then
i
looked
at
my
paper
sack
and
i
saw
that
what
i
had
drawn
was
a
pair
of
wings
black
and
powerful
spread
out
and
stretching
out
of
the
shot
she
curled
the
prehensile
tips
of
her
wings
up
the
soles
of
his
feet
making
him
go
yeek
and
jump
in
the
bed
are
you
awake
she
said
twisting
her
head
around
to
brush
her
lips
over
his
rapt
he
said
she
giggled
and
her
tits
bounced
good
she
said
this
is
the
important
part
auntie
came
home
early
that
day
and
found
me
sitting
at
her
vanity
with
the
photos
and
the
water
glass
and
the
drawings
on
the
paper
sacks
spread
out
before
me
our
eyes
met
for
a
moment
her
pupils
shrank
down
to
tiny
dots
i
remember
it
remember
seeing
them
vanish
leaving
behind
rings
of
yellowed
hazel
one
of
her
hands
lashed
out
in
a
claw
and
sank
into
my
hair
she
lifted
me
out
of
the
chair
by
my
hair
before
i
even
had
a
chance
to
cry
out
almost
before
i
registered
the
fact
that
she
was
hurting
me
she
never
so
much
as
spanked
me
until
then
she
was
strong
in
that
slow
old
russian
lady
way
strong
enough
to
grunt
ten
sacks
of
groceries
in
a
up
the
stairs
to
the
apartment
when
she
picked
me
up
and
tossed
me
it
was
like
being
fired
out
of
a
cannon
i
rebounded
off
the
framed
art
over
the
bed
shattering
the
glass
and
bounced
twice
on
the
mattress
before
coming
to
rest
on
the
floor
my
arm
was
hanging
at
a
funny
angle
and
when
i
tried
to
move
it
it
hurt
so
much
that
i
heard
a
high
sound
in
my
ears
like
a
dog
whistle
i
lay
still
as
the
old
lady
yanked
the
drawers
out
of
her
vanity
and
upended
them
on
the
floor
until
she
found
an
old
book
of
matches
she
swept
the
photos
and
my
sketches
into
the
tin
wastebasket
and
then
lit
a
match
with
trembling
hands
and
dropped
it
in
it
went
out
she
repeated
it
and
on
the
fourth
try
she
got
the
idea
of
using
the
match
to
light
all
the
remaining
matches
in
the
folder
and
drop
that
into
the
bin
a
moment
later
it
was
burning
cheerfully
spitting
curling
red
embers
into
the
air
on
clouds
of
dark
smoke
i
buried
my
face
in
the
matted
carpet
and
tried
not
to
hear
that
high
note
tried
to
will
away
the
sick
grating
feeling
in
my
upper
arm
she
was
wreathed
in
smoke
choking
when
she
finally
turned
to
me
for
a
moment
i
refused
to
meet
her
eye
sure
that
she
would
kill
me
if
i
did
would
see
the
guilt
and
the
knowledge
in
my
face
and
keep
her
secret
with
murder
i
watched
enough
daytime
television
to
know
about
dark
secrets
but
when
she
bent
down
to
me
with
the
creak
of
stretching
elastic
and
she
lifted
me
to
my
feet
and
bent
to
look
me
in
the
eye
she
had
tears
in
her
eyes
she
went
to
the
pile
of
oddments
and
junk
jewelry
that
she
had
dumped
out
on
the
floor
and
sorted
through
it
until
she
found
a
pair
of
sewing
shears
then
she
cut
away
my
supporting
my
broken
arm
with
her
hand
my
wings
were
flapping
nervously
beneath
the
fabric
and
it
got
tangled
and
she
took
firm
hold
of
the
wingtips
and
folded
them
down
to
my
back
and
freed
the
shirt
and
tossed
it
in
the
pile
of
junk
on
her
normally
spotless
floor
she
had
spoken
to
me
less
and
less
since
i
had
fixed
the
television
and
begun
to
pick
up
english
and
now
she
was
wordless
as
she
gently
rotated
my
fingerbones
and
my
wristbones
my
elbow
and
my
shoulder
minute
movements
listening
for
my
teakettle
hiss
when
she
hit
the
sore
spots
is
broken
she
said
she
said
i
am
so
sorry
she
said
i
never
been
to
the
doctor
she
said
never
had
a
pap
smear
or
been
felt
for
lumps
never
ever
had
an
feel
this
she
said
and
put
her
upper
arm
before
his
face
he
took
it
and
ran
his
fingertips
over
it
finding
a
hard
bump
halfway
along
opposite
her
fleshy
bicep
what
this
he
said
it
how
a
bone
sets
if
you
have
a
bad
break
and
do
get
a
cast
crooked
jesus
he
said
giving
it
another
squeeze
now
that
he
knew
what
it
was
he
thought
or
perhaps
fancied
that
he
could
feel
how
the
unevenly
splintered
pieces
of
bone
mated
together
met
at
a
slight
angle
and
fused
together
by
the
knitting
process
she
made
me
a
sling
and
she
fed
me
every
meal
and
brushed
my
teeth
i
had
to
stop
her
from
following
me
into
the
toilet
to
wipe
me
up
and
i
did
care
she
could
have
broken
both
of
my
arms
if
she
only
explained
the
photos
to
me
or
left
them
with
me
so
that
i
could
go
on
investigating
them
but
she
did
neither
she
hardly
spoke
a
word
to
me
she
resettled
herself
against
the
pillows
then
pulled
him
back
against
her
again
and
plumped
his
head
against
her
breasts
are
you
falling
in
love
with
me
she
said
he
startled
the
way
she
said
it
she
did
sound
like
a
young
adult
she
sounded
like
a
small
child
mimi
he
began
then
stopped
himself
i
do
think
so
i
mean
i
like
you
good
she
said
no
falling
in
love
all
right
auntie
died
six
months
later
she
keeled
over
on
the
staircase
on
her
way
up
to
the
apartment
and
i
heard
her
moaning
and
thrashing
out
there
i
hauled
her
up
the
stairs
with
my
good
arm
and
she
crawled
along
on
her
knees
making
gargling
noises
i
got
her
laid
out
on
the
rug
in
the
living
room
i
tried
to
get
her
up
on
the
sofa
but
i
could
budge
her
so
i
gave
her
pillows
from
the
sofa
and
water
and
then
i
tried
tea
but
she
could
take
it
she
threw
up
once
and
i
soaked
it
up
with
a
tea
towel
that
had
fussy
roses
on
it
she
took
my
hand
and
her
grip
was
weak
her
strong
hands
suddenly
thin
and
shaky
it
took
an
hour
for
her
to
die
when
she
died
she
made
a
rasping
rattling
sound
and
then
she
shat
herself
i
could
smell
it
it
was
all
i
could
smell
as
i
sat
there
in
the
little
apartment
six
years
old
hot
as
hell
outside
and
stuffy
inside
i
opened
the
windows
and
watched
the
hasids
walk
past
i
felt
like
i
should
for
the
old
lady
but
i
did
know
what
i
formulated
a
plan
i
would
go
outside
and
bring
in
some
to
take
care
of
the
old
lady
i
would
do
the
grocery
shopping
and
eat
sandwiches
until
i
was
twelve
at
which
point
i
would
be
grown
up
and
i
would
get
a
job
fixing
televisions
i
marched
into
my
room
and
changed
into
my
best
clothes
the
little
dress
i
wore
to
dinner
on
sundays
and
i
brushed
my
hair
and
put
on
my
socks
with
the
blue
at
the
ankles
and
found
my
shoes
in
the
hall
closet
but
it
had
been
three
years
since
i
last
worn
the
shoes
and
i
could
barely
fit
three
toes
in
them
the
old
lady
shoes
were
so
big
i
could
fit
both
feet
in
either
one
i
took
off
my
socks
sometimes
i
seen
kids
going
by
barefoot
outside
but
never
in
just
socks
and
reached
for
the
doorknob
i
touched
it
i
stopped
i
turned
around
again
there
was
a
stain
forming
under
auntie
piss
and
shit
and
and
as
i
looked
at
her
i
had
a
firm
sense
that
it
would
be
to
bring
people
up
to
her
apartment
with
her
like
this
i
seen
dead
people
on
tv
they
were
propped
up
on
pillows
in
clean
hospital
nighties
with
rouged
cheeks
i
did
know
how
far
i
could
get
but
i
thought
i
owed
it
to
her
to
try
i
figured
that
it
was
better
than
going
outside
she
was
lighter
in
death
as
though
something
had
fled
her
i
could
drag
her
into
the
bathroom
and
prop
her
on
the
edge
of
the
tub
i
needed
to
wash
her
before
anyone
else
came
up
i
cut
away
her
dress
with
the
sewing
shears
she
was
wearing
an
elastic
girdle
beneath
and
an
enormous
brassiere
and
they
were
too
tough
too
tight
to
cut
through
so
i
struggled
with
their
hooks
each
one
going
as
i
unhooked
it
revealing
red
skin
beneath
it
pinched
and
when
i
got
to
her
bra
i
had
a
moment
pause
she
was
a
modest
person
i
never
even
seen
her
legs
without
tan
compression
hose
but
the
smell
was
overwhelming
and
i
just
held
to
that
vision
of
her
in
a
nightie
and
clean
sheets
and
you
know
for
popped
the
hooks
felt
it
give
way
as
her
breasts
forced
it
off
her
back
found
myself
staring
at
two
little
wings
the
size
of
my
thumbs
bent
and
cramped
broken
folded
there
over
her
shoulder
blades
i
touched
them
and
they
were
cold
and
hard
as
a
turkey
neck
i
once
found
in
the
trash
after
she
made
soup
with
it
how
did
you
get
out
with
my
wings
yeah
with
your
wings
and
with
no
shoes
and
with
the
old
lady
dead
over
the
tub
she
nuzzled
his
neck
then
bit
it
then
kissed
it
then
bit
it
again
brushed
her
fingers
over
his
nipples
i
do
know
she
breathed
hot
in
his
ear
he
arched
his
back
you
do
know
i
do
know
that
all
i
remember
for
five
years
he
arched
his
back
again
and
raked
his
fingertips
over
her
thighs
making
her
shudder
and
jerk
her
wings
back
that
when
he
saw
the
corpse
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
it
was
george
he
went
back
to
school
the
day
after
they
buried
davey
he
bathed
all
the
brothers
in
the
hot
spring
and
got
their
teeth
brushed
and
he
fed
them
a
hot
breakfast
of
boiled
stew
and
he
gathered
up
their
schoolbooks
from
the
forgotten
corners
of
the
winter
cave
and
put
them
into
school
bags
then
he
led
them
down
the
hillside
on
a
spring
day
that
smelled
wonderful
loam
and
cold
water
coursing
down
the
mountainside
in
rivulets
and
new
grass
and
new
growth
drying
out
in
a
hard
white
sun
that
seemed
to
spring
directly
overhead
five
minutes
after
it
rose
they
held
hands
as
they
walked
down
the
hill
and
then
broke
away
and
ran
down
the
hill
to
the
roadside
skipping
over
the
stones
and
holding
their
belly
as
they
flew
down
the
hillside
alan
laughed
at
the
impatient
jig
they
danced
as
they
waited
for
him
and
brad
to
catch
up
with
them
and
brad
put
an
arm
around
his
shoulder
and
kissed
him
on
the
cheek
in
a
moment
of
uncharacteristic
demonstrativeness
he
marched
right
into
davenport
office
with
his
brothers
in
tow
we
back
he
said
davenport
peered
at
them
over
the
tops
of
his
glasses
you
are
are
you
mom
took
sick
he
said
very
sick
we
had
to
go
live
with
our
aunt
and
she
was
too
far
away
for
us
to
get
to
school
i
see
davenport
said
i
taught
the
littler
ones
as
best
as
i
could
alan
said
he
liked
davenport
understood
him
he
had
a
job
to
do
and
needed
everything
to
be
accounted
for
and
filed
away
it
was
okay
for
alan
and
his
brothers
to
miss
months
of
school
provided
that
they
had
a
good
excuse
when
they
came
back
alan
could
respect
that
and
i
read
ahead
in
my
textbooks
i
think
we
be
okay
i
sure
you
will
be
davenport
said
how
is
your
mother
now
she
better
he
said
but
she
was
very
sick
in
the
hospital
what
was
she
sick
with
alan
had
thought
this
far
ahead
he
knew
how
to
lie
to
adults
but
he
was
out
of
practice
cancer
he
said
thinking
of
marci
mother
cancer
davenport
said
staring
hard
at
him
but
she
better
now
alan
said
i
see
you
boys
why
do
you
get
to
class
alan
please
wait
here
a
moment
his
brothers
filed
out
of
the
room
and
alan
shuffled
nervously
looking
at
the
class
ring
on
davenport
hairy
finger
remembering
the
time
that
davey
had
kicked
him
he
never
asked
alan
where
davey
was
after
that
and
alan
had
never
offered
and
it
had
been
as
though
they
shared
a
secret
are
you
all
right
alan
he
asked
settling
down
behind
his
desk
taking
off
his
glasses
yes
sir
alan
said
you
getting
enough
to
eat
at
home
there
a
quiet
place
where
you
can
work
yes
alan
said
squirming
it
fine
now
that
mom
is
home
i
see
davenport
said
listen
to
me
son
he
said
putting
his
hands
flat
on
the
desk
the
school
district
has
some
resources
available
clothes
lunch
vouchers
big
brother
programs
they
not
anything
you
have
to
be
ashamed
of
it
not
charity
it
just
a
little
booster
a
bit
of
help
the
other
children
their
parents
are
well
and
they
live
in
town
and
have
lots
of
advantages
that
you
and
your
brothers
lack
this
is
just
how
we
level
the
playing
field
you
a
very
bright
lad
and
your
brothers
are
growing
up
well
but
it
no
sin
to
accept
a
little
help
alan
suddenly
felt
like
laughing
we
not
underprivileged
he
said
thinking
of
the
mountain
of
the
feeling
of
being
encompassed
by
love
of
his
father
of
the
flakes
of
soft
lustrous
gold
the
golems
produced
by
the
handful
we
very
well
off
he
said
thinking
of
home
now
free
of
davey
and
his
hateful
spiteful
anger
thank
you
though
he
said
thinking
of
his
life
unfolding
before
him
free
from
the
terror
of
davey
bites
and
spying
and
rocks
thrown
from
afar
davenport
scowled
and
stared
hard
at
him
alan
met
his
stare
and
smiled
it
time
for
classes
he
said
can
i
go
go
davenport
said
he
shook
his
head
but
remember
you
can
always
come
here
if
you
have
anything
you
want
to
talk
to
me
about
i
remember
alan
said
six
years
later
bradley
was
big
and
strong
and
he
was
the
star
goalie
of
all
the
hockey
teams
in
town
in
front
of
the
puck
before
it
arrived
making
desperate
almost
nonchalant
saves
that
had
them
howling
in
the
stands
stomping
their
feet
and
sloshing
their
tim
horton
coffee
over
the
bleachers
to
freeze
into
brown
ice
in
the
summer
he
was
the
star
pitcher
on
every
softball
team
and
the
girls
trailed
after
him
like
a
long
comet
tail
after
the
games
when
the
other
players
led
him
away
to
a
park
to
drink
illicit
beers
alan
watched
his
games
from
afar
with
his
schoolbooks
on
his
lap
and
nearby
playing
trucks
or
reading
or
gnawing
on
a
sucker
by
the
ninth
inning
or
the
final
period
the
young
ones
would
be
too
tired
to
play
and
they
come
and
lean
heavily
against
alan
like
a
bag
of
lead
pressing
on
him
eyes
half
open
and
alan
would
put
an
arm
around
them
and
feel
at
one
with
the
universe
it
snowed
on
the
afternoon
of
the
season
opener
for
the
town
softball
league
that
year
fat
white
wet
flakes
that
kissed
your
cheeks
and
melted
away
in
an
instant
so
soft
that
you
were
sure
they
be
there
at
all
bradley
caught
up
with
alan
on
their
lunch
break
at
the
cafeteria
in
the
high
school
two
blocks
from
the
elementary
school
he
had
his
mitt
with
him
and
a
huge
grin
you
planning
on
playing
through
the
snow
alan
said
as
he
set
down
his
cheeseburger
and
stared
out
the
window
at
the
diffuse
white
radiance
of
the
april
noontime
bouncing
off
the
flakes
it
be
gone
by
tonight
gon
na
be
bradley
said
and
nodded
at
his
jock
buddies
sitting
at
their
long
table
sucking
down
cokes
and
staring
at
the
girls
gon
na
be
a
good
game
i
know
it
bradley
knew
he
knew
when
they
were
getting
shorted
at
the
when
they
brought
in
the
golems
gold
just
as
he
knew
that
showing
up
for
lunch
with
a
brown
bag
full
of
dried
squirrel
jerky
and
mushrooms
and
lemongrass
was
a
surefire
way
to
end
up
social
roadkill
in
the
high
school
hierarchy
as
was
dressing
like
someone
who
been
caught
in
an
explosion
at
the
salvation
army
and
so
he
had
money
and
he
had
burgers
and
he
had
a
pair
of
jeans
from
the
gap
and
a
roots
sweatshirt
and
a
stussy
baseball
hat
and
reebok
sneakers
and
he
looked
basically
like
a
real
person
alan
could
say
the
same
for
himself
but
he
been
making
an
effort
since
bradley
got
to
high
school
if
only
to
save
his
brother
the
embarrassment
of
being
related
to
the
biggest
reject
in
the
building
but
alan
still
managed
to
exude
his
aura
enough
that
no
one
tried
to
cozy
up
to
him
and
make
friends
with
him
and
scrutinize
his
persona
close
in
which
was
just
as
he
wanted
it
bradley
watched
a
girl
walk
past
a
cute
thing
with
red
hair
and
freckles
and
a
skinny
rawboned
look
and
alan
remembered
that
she
been
sitting
next
to
him
in
class
for
going
on
two
years
now
and
he
never
bothered
to
learn
her
name
and
he
never
bothered
to
notice
that
she
was
a
dead
ringer
for
marci
i
always
had
a
thing
for
redheads
bradley
said
because
of
you
he
said
you
and
your
girlfriend
i
mean
if
she
was
good
enough
for
well
she
had
to
be
the
epitome
of
sophistication
and
sexiness
back
then
you
were
like
a
god
to
me
so
she
was
like
a
goddess
i
imprinted
on
her
like
the
baby
ducks
in
bio
it
amazing
how
much
of
who
i
am
today
i
can
trace
back
to
those
days
who
knew
that
it
was
all
so
important
he
was
a
smart
kid
introspective
without
being
moody
integrated
always
popping
off
these
fine
little
observations
in
between
his
easy
jokes
the
girls
adored
him
the
boys
admired
him
the
teachers
were
grateful
for
him
and
the
way
he
bridged
the
gap
between
scholarship
and
athleticism
i
must
have
been
a
weird
kid
he
said
all
that
quiet
you
were
a
great
kid
alan
said
it
was
a
lot
of
fun
back
then
mostly
mostly
he
said
they
both
stared
at
the
girl
who
noticed
them
now
and
blushed
and
looked
confused
bradley
looked
away
but
alvin
held
his
gaze
on
her
and
she
whispered
to
a
friend
who
looked
at
him
and
they
both
laughed
and
then
alan
looked
away
too
sorry
that
he
inadvertently
interacted
with
his
fellow
students
he
was
supposed
to
watch
not
participate
he
was
real
bradley
said
and
alan
knew
he
meant
davey
yeah
alan
said
i
do
think
the
little
ones
really
remember
him
he
more
like
a
bad
dream
to
them
but
he
was
real
was
he
yeah
alan
said
but
he
gone
now
was
it
right
what
do
you
mean
alan
said
he
felt
a
sear
of
anger
arc
along
his
spine
it
nothing
billy
said
mumbling
into
his
tray
what
do
you
mean
brad
alan
said
what
else
should
we
have
done
how
can
you
have
any
doubts
i
do
brad
said
it
okay
alan
looked
down
at
his
hands
which
appeared
to
belong
to
someone
else
white
lumps
of
dough
clenched
into
hard
fists
knuckles
white
he
made
himself
unclench
them
no
it
okay
tell
me
about
this
you
remember
what
he
was
like
what
he
did
i
remember
it
bryan
said
of
course
i
remember
it
he
was
staring
through
the
table
now
the
look
he
got
when
he
was
contemplating
a
future
the
rest
of
them
could
see
but
alan
waited
he
was
trembling
inside
he
done
the
right
thing
saved
his
family
he
knew
that
but
for
six
years
he
found
himself
turning
in
his
memory
to
the
little
boy
on
the
ground
holding
the
loops
of
intestine
in
through
slippery
red
fingers
for
six
years
whenever
he
been
somewhere
quiet
long
enough
that
his
own
inner
voices
fell
still
he
remember
the
hair
in
his
fist
the
knife
thirsty
draught
as
it
drew
forth
the
hot
splash
of
blood
from
davey
throat
remembered
the
ragged
fissure
that
opened
down
clarence
length
and
the
way
that
davey
fell
down
it
so
light
and
desiccated
he
was
almost
weightless
if
you
remember
it
then
you
know
i
did
the
right
thing
i
did
the
only
thing
did
the
only
thing
brian
said
and
covered
alan
hand
with
his
alan
nodded
and
stared
at
his
cheeseburger
you
better
go
catch
up
with
your
friends
he
said
i
love
you
adam
he
said
i
love
you
too
billy
crossed
the
room
nodding
to
the
people
who
greeted
him
from
every
table
geeks
and
jocks
and
band
and
all
the
meaningless
tribes
of
the
high
school
universe
the
cute
redhead
sprinkled
a
wave
at
him
and
he
nodded
at
her
the
tips
of
his
ears
going
pink
the
snow
stopped
by
three
and
the
sun
came
out
and
melted
it
away
so
that
by
the
time
the
game
started
at
its
only
remnant
was
the
soggy
ground
around
the
bleachers
with
the
new
grass
growing
out
of
the
ragged
brown
memory
of
last
summer
lawn
alan
took
the
little
ones
for
dinner
at
the
diner
after
school
letting
them
order
double
pancakes
at
they
settled
into
a
fatness
that
made
him
think
of
a
toy
the
rolls
and
dimples
at
their
wrists
and
elbows
and
knees
like
the
seams
on
a
doll
you
starting
high
school
next
year
alan
said
as
they
were
pouring
syrup
on
their
second
helping
he
was
startled
by
this
how
had
they
gotten
so
old
so
quickly
eli
said
i
guess
so
you
graduating
from
elementary
school
this
spring
yeah
eli
grinned
a
chocolate
smile
at
him
it
no
big
deal
a
party
though
where
at
some
kid
house
it
okay
alan
said
we
can
celebrate
at
home
do
let
them
get
to
you
we
ca
go
ed
suddenly
looked
a
little
panicked
you
invited
he
blurted
it
out
and
then
wished
he
had
of
course
we
invited
fred
said
from
inside
ed
throat
going
to
be
dancing
you
can
dance
alan
asked
we
can
ed
said
we
learned
in
gym
greg
said
with
the
softest
proudest
voice
deep
within
them
well
alan
said
he
did
know
what
to
say
high
school
dancing
invited
to
parties
no
one
had
invited
him
to
parties
when
he
graduated
from
elementary
school
and
he
been
too
busy
with
the
little
ones
to
go
in
any
event
he
felt
a
little
jealous
but
mostly
proud
want
a
milkshake
he
asked
mentally
totting
up
the
cash
in
his
pocket
and
thinking
that
he
should
probably
send
brad
to
dicker
with
the
assayer
again
soon
no
thank
you
ed
said
we
watching
our
weight
alan
laughed
then
saw
they
were
joking
and
tried
to
turn
it
into
a
cough
but
it
was
too
late
their
shy
chocolate
smile
turned
into
a
pout
the
game
started
bang
on
time
at
six
just
as
the
sun
was
setting
the
diamond
lights
flicked
on
with
an
audible
click
and
made
a
spot
of
glare
that
cast
out
the
twilight
benny
was
already
on
the
mound
he
been
warming
up
with
the
catcher
tossing
them
in
fast
and
exuberant
and
confident
and
controlled
he
looked
good
on
the
mound
the
ump
called
the
start
and
the
batter
stepped
up
to
the
plate
and
benny
struck
him
out
in
three
pitches
and
the
little
ones
went
nuts
cheering
their
brother
on
along
with
the
other
fans
in
the
bleachers
a
crowd
as
big
as
any
you
ever
see
outside
of
school
thirty
or
forty
people
the
second
batter
stepped
up
and
benny
pitched
a
strike
another
strike
and
then
a
wild
pitch
that
nearly
beaned
the
batter
in
the
head
the
catcher
cocked
his
mask
quizzically
and
benny
kicked
the
dirt
and
windmilled
his
arm
a
little
and
shook
his
head
he
tossed
another
wild
one
this
one
coming
in
so
low
that
it
practically
rolled
across
the
plate
his
teammates
were
standing
up
in
their
box
now
watching
him
carefully
stop
kidding
around
alan
heard
one
of
them
say
just
strike
him
out
benny
smiled
spat
caught
the
ball
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
he
wound
up
made
ready
to
pitch
and
then
dropped
the
ball
and
fell
to
his
knees
crying
out
as
though
he
been
struck
alan
grabbed
the
little
ones
hand
and
pushed
onto
the
diamond
before
benny
knees
hit
the
ground
he
caught
up
with
benny
as
he
keeled
over
sideways
bringing
his
knees
up
to
his
chest
eyes
open
and
staring
and
empty
alan
caught
his
head
and
cradled
it
on
his
lap
and
was
dimly
aware
that
a
crowd
had
formed
round
them
he
felt
barry
heart
thundering
in
his
chest
and
his
arms
were
stuck
straight
out
to
his
sides
one
hand
in
his
pitcher
glove
the
other
clenched
tightly
around
the
ball
it
a
seizure
someone
said
from
the
crowd
is
he
an
epileptic
a
seizure
someone
tried
to
prize
alan
fingers
from
around
barry
head
and
he
grunted
and
hissed
at
them
and
they
withdrew
barry
alan
said
looking
into
barry
face
that
faraway
look
in
his
eyes
a
million
miles
away
alan
knew
he
seen
it
before
but
not
in
years
the
eyes
came
back
into
focus
closed
opened
davey
back
barry
said
alan
skin
went
cold
and
he
realized
that
he
was
squeezing
barry
head
like
a
melon
he
relaxed
his
grip
and
helped
him
to
his
feet
got
barry
arm
around
his
shoulders
and
helped
him
off
the
diamond
you
okay
one
of
the
players
asked
as
they
walked
past
him
but
barry
did
answer
the
little
ones
were
walking
beside
them
now
clutching
barry
hand
and
they
turned
their
back
on
the
town
as
a
family
and
walked
toward
the
mountain
george
had
come
to
visit
him
once
before
not
long
after
alan
moved
to
toronto
he
could
come
without
bringing
down
elliot
and
ferdinand
of
course
but
it
was
george
idea
to
visit
that
was
clear
from
the
moment
they
rang
the
bell
of
the
slightly
grotty
apartment
he
moved
into
in
the
annex
near
the
students
who
were
barely
older
than
him
but
seemed
to
belong
to
a
different
species
they
were
about
by
then
and
fat
as
housecats
with
the
same
sense
of
grace
and
inertia
in
their
swinging
bellies
and
wobbling
chins
alan
welcomed
them
in
edward
was
wearing
a
pair
of
wool
trousers
pulled
nearly
up
to
his
nipples
and
short
suspenders
that
were
taut
over
his
white
shirt
he
was
grinning
fleshily
his
hair
damp
with
sweat
and
curled
with
the
humidity
he
opened
his
mouth
and
george
voice
emerged
this
place
is
he
stood
with
his
mouth
open
while
inside
him
george
thought
i
never
he
closed
his
mouth
then
opened
it
again
what
a
now
ed
spoke
jesus
figure
out
what
you
going
to
say
before
you
say
it
willya
this
is
just
plain
rude
came
fede
voice
from
his
mouth
i
sorry
came
george
voice
ed
was
working
on
his
suspenders
then
unbuttoning
his
shirt
and
dropping
his
pants
so
that
he
stood
in
grimy
jockeys
with
his
slick
tight
hairy
belly
before
alan
he
tipped
himself
over
and
then
alan
was
with
freddy
who
was
wearing
a
and
a
pair
of
boxer
shorts
with
blue
and
white
stripes
freddy
was
scowling
comically
and
alan
hid
a
grin
behind
his
hand
freddy
tipped
to
one
side
and
there
was
george
short
and
delicately
formed
and
pale
as
a
frozen
french
fry
he
grabbed
freddy
hips
like
handles
and
scrambled
out
of
him
springing
into
the
air
and
coming
down
on
the
balls
of
his
feet
holding
his
gut
over
his
hulk
underoos
it
incredible
he
hooted
dancing
from
one
foot
to
the
other
brilliant
god
i
never
ever
going
home
oh
yes
alan
said
not
bothering
to
hide
his
smile
as
frederick
and
george
separated
and
righted
themselves
and
where
will
you
sleep
then
here
he
said
running
around
the
tiny
apartment
opening
the
fridge
and
the
stove
and
the
toaster
oven
flushing
the
toilet
turning
on
the
shower
faucets
sorry
alan
called
as
he
ran
by
no
vacancies
at
the
hotel
anders
then
i
wo
sleep
he
cried
on
his
next
pass
i
play
all
night
and
all
day
in
the
streets
i
knock
on
every
door
on
every
street
and
introduce
myself
to
every
person
and
learn
their
stories
and
read
their
books
and
meet
their
kids
and
pet
their
dogs
you
bonkers
alan
said
using
the
word
that
the
lunch
lady
back
at
school
had
used
when
chastising
them
for
tearing
around
the
cafeteria
easy
for
you
to
say
greg
said
skidding
to
a
stop
in
front
of
him
easy
for
you
you
you
got
you
do
have
to
deal
with
he
closed
his
mouth
and
his
hand
went
to
his
lips
alan
was
still
young
and
had
a
penchant
for
the
dramatic
so
he
went
around
to
the
kitchen
and
pulled
a
bottle
of
vodka
out
of
the
freezer
and
banged
it
down
on
the
counter
pouring
out
four
shots
he
tossed
back
his
shot
and
returned
the
bottle
to
the
freezer
george
followed
suit
and
choked
and
turned
purple
but
managed
to
keep
his
expression
neutral
fred
and
ed
each
took
a
sip
then
set
the
drinks
down
with
a
sour
face
how
home
alan
said
quietly
sliding
back
to
sit
on
the
minuscule
counter
surface
in
his
kitchenette
it
okay
ed
mumbled
perching
on
the
arm
of
the
goodwill
sofa
that
came
with
the
apartment
without
his
brothers
within
him
he
moved
sprightly
and
lightly
it
fine
fred
said
looking
out
the
window
at
the
street
below
craning
his
neck
to
see
bloor
street
and
the
kids
smoking
out
front
of
the
brunswick
house
it
awful
greg
said
and
pulled
himself
back
up
on
the
counter
with
them
and
i
not
going
back
the
two
older
brothers
looked
balefully
at
him
then
mutely
appealed
to
alan
this
was
new
since
infancy
had
acted
with
complete
unity
of
will
when
they
were
in
the
first
grade
alan
had
wondered
if
they
were
really
just
one
person
in
three
parts
that
was
how
close
their
agreements
were
brian
left
last
week
greg
said
and
drummed
his
heels
on
the
cabinet
doors
did
say
a
word
to
any
of
us
just
left
he
comes
and
goes
like
that
all
the
time
sometimes
for
weeks
craig
was
halfway
around
the
world
he
was
in
toronto
and
brian
was
that
left
just
and
davey
alone
in
the
cave
no
wonder
they
were
here
on
his
doorstep
what
he
doing
he
just
sits
there
and
watches
us
but
that
enough
we
almost
finished
with
school
he
dropped
his
chin
to
his
chest
i
thought
we
could
finish
here
find
a
job
a
place
to
live
he
blushed
furiously
a
girl
ed
and
fred
were
staring
at
their
laps
alan
tried
to
picture
the
logistics
but
he
could
not
really
there
was
no
scenario
in
which
he
could
see
his
brothers
carrying
on
with
do
be
an
idiot
ed
said
he
sounded
surprisingly
bitter
he
was
usually
a
cheerful
person
or
at
least
a
fat
and
smiling
person
alan
realized
for
the
first
time
that
the
two
were
equivalent
george
jutted
his
chin
toward
the
sofa
and
his
brothers
they
know
what
they
want
to
do
they
think
that
it
be
hard
to
live
here
we
should
hide
out
in
the
cave
forever
alan
talk
to
him
fred
said
he
nuts
look
george
said
you
gone
you
gone
the
king
under
the
mountain
now
is
davey
if
we
stay
there
we
end
up
his
slaves
or
his
victims
let
him
keep
it
there
a
whole
world
out
here
we
can
live
in
i
do
see
any
reason
to
let
my
handicap
keep
me
down
it
not
a
handicap
edward
said
patiently
it
just
how
we
are
we
different
we
not
like
the
rest
of
them
neither
is
alan
george
said
and
here
he
is
in
the
big
city
living
with
them
working
meeting
people
out
of
the
mountain
alan
more
like
them
than
he
is
like
us
frederick
said
we
not
like
them
we
ca
pass
for
them
alan
jaw
hung
slack
handicapped
passing
like
them
not
like
them
he
never
thought
of
his
brothers
this
way
they
were
just
his
brothers
just
his
family
they
could
communicate
with
the
outside
world
they
were
people
different
but
the
same
you
just
as
good
as
they
are
he
said
and
that
shut
them
up
they
all
regarded
him
as
if
waiting
for
him
to

at

going
twice
let

george
said
he
went
and
took
his
brothers
hands
go
okay
they
had
a
really
good
time
george
body
was
propped
up
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
he
was
white
and
wrinkled
as
a
big
toe
in
a
bathtub
skin
pulled
tight
in
his
face
so
that
his
hairline
and
eyebrows
and
cheeks
seemed
raised
in
surprise
alan
smelled
him
now
a
stink
like
a
mouse
dead
between
the
gyprock
in
the
walls
the
worst
smell
imaginable
he
felt
mimi
breathing
behind
him
her
chest
heaving
against
his
back
he
reached
out
and
pushed
aside
the
wings
moving
them
by
their
translucent
membranes
fingers
brushing
the
tiny
fingerlets
at
the
wingtips
recognizing
in
their
touch
some
evolutionary
connection
with
his
own
hands
george
toppled
over
as
alan
stepped
off
the
bed
moving
in
the
twilight
of
the
light
from
under
the
bathroom
door
mimi
came
off
the
bed
on
the
other
side
and
hit
the
overhead
light
switch
turning
the
room
as
bright
as
an
icebox
making
alan
squint
painfully
she
closed
the
blinds
quickly
then
went
to
the
door
and
shot
the
chain
and
the
deadbolt
closed
mimi
looked
down
at
him
ugly
sumbitch
whoever
he
was
my
brother
alan
said
oh
she
said
she
went
back
around
the
bed
and
sat
on
the
edge
facing
the
wall
sorry
she
crossed
her
leg
and
jiggled
her
foot
making
the
springs
squeak
alan
was
listening
he
knelt
down
and
touched
george
cheek
the
skin
was
soft
and
spongy
porous
and
saturated
cold
his
fingertips
came
away
with
shed
white
flakes
of
translucent
skin
clinging
to
them
davey
alan
said
are
you
in
here
mimi
foot
stilled
they
both
listened
intently
there
were
sounds
in
the
motel
distant
muffled
tvs
and
car
engines
and
fucking
but
no
sound
of
papery
skin
thudding
on
carpet
he
must
have
come
up
through
the
drain
alan
said
in
the
bathroom
the
broad
pale
moon
of
george
belly
was
abraded
in
long
grey
stripes
he
stood
and
wiping
his
hand
on
his
bare
thigh
reached
for
the
bathroom
doorknob
the
door
swung
open
revealing
the
brightness
of
the
bathroom
the
water
sloshed
on
the
floor
by
mimi
earlier
the
heaps
of
damp
towels
how
he
find
us
here
mimi
in
her
outsized
blazer
and
track
pants
touched
him
on
his
bare
shoulder
he
suddenly
felt
terribly
naked
he
backed
out
of
the
bathroom
shoving
mimi
aside
and
numbly
pulled
on
his
jeans
and
a
shapeless
sweatshirt
that
smelled
of
mimi
and
had
long
curly
hairs
lurking
in
the
fabric
that
stuck
to
his
face
like
cobwebs
he
jammed
his
feet
into
his
sneakers
he
realized
that
he
had
to
step
over
his
brother
body
six
times
to
do
this
he
looked
at
his
brother
again
he
could
make
sense
of
what
he
was
seeing
the
abraded
belly
the
rictus
his
balls
shrunk
to
an
albino
walnut
his
cock
shriveled
up
to
unrecognizability
the
hair
curly
matted
all
over
his
body
patchily
rubbed
away
he
paced
in
the
little
run
beside
the
bed
the
only
pacing
room
he
had
that
did
require
stepping
over
george
body
back
and
forth
two
paces
turn
two
paces
turn
i
going
to
cover
him
up
mimi
said
good
fine
alan
said
are
you
going
to
be
okay
yes
fine
alan
said
are
you
freaking
out
alan
did
say
anything
george
looked
an
awful
lot
like
davey
had
the
day
they
killed
him
mimi
found
a
spare
blanket
in
the
closet
reeking
of
mothballs
and
scarred
with
a
few
curdled
cigarette
burns
and
she
spread
it
out
on
the
floor
and
helped
him
lift
grant
body
onto
it
and
wind
it
tightly
around
him
what
now
she
said
he
looked
down
at
the
wound
sheet
the
lump
within
it
he
sat
down
heavily
on
the
bed
his
chest
was
tight
and
his
breath
came
in
short
she
sat
beside
him
and
put
an
arm
around
his
shoulder
tried
to
pull
his
head
down
to
her
bosom
but
he
stiffened
his
neck
i
knew
this
was
coming
he
said
when
we
killed
darren
i
knew
she
stood
and
lit
a
cigarette
this
is
your
family
business
she
said
why
we
driving
up
north
he
nodded
not
trusting
his
voice
seeing
the
outlines
of
grad
face
outlined
in
blanket
so
she
said
let
get
up
north
then
take
an
end
the
night
was
cold
and
they
staggered
under
the
weight
of
the
body
wound
in
the
blanket
and
laid
him
out
in
the
trunk
of
the
car
shifting
luggage
and
picnic
supplies
to
the
back
seat
at
two
the
motel
lights
were
out
and
the
road
was
dark
and
silent
but
for
the
soughing
of
wind
and
the
distant
sounds
of
night
animals
are
you
okay
to
drive
she
said
as
she
piled
their
clothes
indiscriminately
into
the
suitcases
what
he
said
the
cool
air
on
his
face
was
waking
him
up
a
little
but
he
was
still
in
a
the
air
was
spicy
and
outdoors
and
it
reminded
him
powerfully
of
home
and
simpler
times
he
looked
at
mimi
without
really
seeing
her
are
you
okay
to
drive
the
keys
were
in
his
hands
the
car
smelling
of
the
mist
that
the
rental
agency
sprayed
on
the
upholstery
to
get
rid
of
the
discount
traveler
farts
between
rentals
i
can
drive
he
said
home
and
the
mountain
and
the
washing
machine
and
the
nook
where
he
slept
for
years
and
the
golems
and
the
cradle
they
hewn
for
him
another
ten
or
twelve
hours
driving
and
they
be
at
the
foot
of
the
trail
where
the
grass
grew
to
well
then
she
got
in
the
car
and
slammed
her
door
he
climbed
in
started
the
engine
and
put
the
hertzmobile
into
reverse
two
hours
later
he
realized
that
he
was
going
to
nod
off
the
thumps
of
the
body
sliding
in
the
trunk
and
the
suitcases
rattling
around
in
the
back
seat
had
lost
their
power
to
keep
him
awake
the
body
thumping
had
hardly
had
the
power
to
begin
with
once
the
initial
shock
had
passed
the
body
became
an
object
only
a
thing
a
payload
he
had
to
deliver
alan
wondered
if
he
was
capable
of
feeling
the
loss
you
were
eleven
then
he
said
it
was
suddenly
as
though
no
time
had
past
since
they
sat
on
the
bed
and
she
told
him
about
auntie
yes
she
said
it
was
as
though
no
time
had
passed
a
shiver
went
up
his
back
he
was
wide
awake
no
time
had
passed
yes
i
was
living
with
a
nice
family
in
oakville
who
were
sending
me
to
a
nice
girls
school
where
we
wore
blazers
over
our
tunics
and
i
had
a
permanent
note
excusing
me
from
gym
classes
in
a
building
full
of
four
hundred
girls
going
through
puberty
one
more
fat
shy
girl
who
take
her
top
off
was
hardly
noteworthy
the
family
they
were
nice
waspy
they
called
me
cheryl
with
a
why
when
i
asked
them
where
i
been
before
about
they
looked
sad
and
hurt
and
worried
for
me
and
i
learned
to
stop
they
hugged
me
and
touched
my
wings
and
never
said
anything
and
never
wiped
their
hands
on
their
pants
after
touching
them
they
gave
me
a
room
with
a
computer
and
a
cd
player
and
a
little
tv
of
my
own
and
asked
me
to
bring
home
my
friends
i
had
none
but
they
found
other
girls
who
would
come
to
my
parties
on
may
which
was
exactly
two
months
after
their
son
birthday
and
two
months
before
their
daughter
birthday
i
ca
remember
any
of
their
names
but
they
made
me
birthday
cards
and
they
made
me
breakfast
and
dinner
and
they
made
me
welcome
i
could
watch
them
grilling
burgers
in
the
back
yard
by
the
above
ground
pool
in
the
summer
from
my
bedroom
window
i
could
watch
them
building
forts
or
freezing
skating
rinks
in
the
winter
i
could
listen
to
them
eating
dinner
together
while
i
did
my
homework
in
my
bedroom
there
was
a
place
for
me
at
the
but
i
could
sit
there
though
i
ca
remember
why
wait
a
second
alan
said
you
do
remember
she
made
a
sad
noise
in
her
throat
i
was
told
i
was
welcome
but
i
knew
i
was
i
know
that
sounds
paranoid
crazy
maybe
i
was
just
a
teenager
there
was
a
reason
though
i
just
do
know
what
it
was
i
knew
then
they
knew
it
too
no
one
blamed
me
they
loved
me
i
guess
you
stayed
with
them
until
you
went
to
school
almost
their
daughter
went
to
waterloo
then
the
next
year
their
son
went
to
mcgill
in
montreal
and
then
it
was
just
me
and
them
i
had
two
more
years
of
high
school
but
it
just
got
unbearable
with
their
children
gone
they
tried
to
take
an
interest
in
me
tried
to
make
me
eat
with
them
take
me
out
to
meet
their
friends
every
day
felt
worse
more
wrong
one
night
i
went
to
a
late
movie
by
myself
downtown
and
then
got
to
walking
around
near
the
clubs
and
looking
at
the
club
kids
and
feeling
this
terrible
feeling
of
loneliness
and
when
i
was
finally
ready
to
go
home
the
last
train
had
already
gone
i
just
spent
the
night
out
wandering
around
sitting
in
a
back
booth
at
sneaky
dee
and
drinking
cokes
watching
the
sun
come
up
from
the
top
of
christie
pitts
overlooking
the
baseball
diamond
i
was
a
girl
from
the
suburbs
wearing
a
big
coat
and
staring
at
her
shoelaces
but
no
one
bugged
me
when
i
came
home
the
next
morning
no
one
seemed
particularly
bothered
that
i
been
away
all
night
if
anything
the
parental
people
might
have
been
a
little
distraught
that
i
came
home
think
i
get
my
own
place
i
said
they
agreed
and
agreed
to
put
the
lease
in
their
name
to
make
things
easier
i
got
a
crummy
little
basement
in
what
the
landlord
called
cabbagetown
but
what
was
really
regent
park
and
i
switched
out
to
a
huge
anonymous
high
school
to
finish
school
worked
in
a
restaurant
at
nights
and
on
weekends
to
pay
the
bills
the
night
highway
rushed
past
them
quiet
she
lit
a
cigarette
and
rolled
down
her
window
letting
in
the
crash
of
the
wind
and
the
smell
of
the
smoke
mixed
with
the
reek
of
the
roadside
give
me
one
of
those
alan
said
she
lit
another
and
put
it
between
his
lips
damp
with
her
saliva
his
skin
came
up
in
goosepimples
who
knows
about
your
wings
he
said
krishna
knows
she
said
and
you
she
looked
out
into
the
night
the
family
in
oakville
if
i
could
remember
where
they
lived
i
look
them
up
and
ask
them
about
it
ca
ca
remember
their
names
or
their
faces
i
remember
the
pool
though
and
the
barbecue
no
one
else
knows
there
was
no
one
else
before
krishna
no
one
that
i
remember
anyway
i
have
a
brother
he
said
then
swallowed
hard
i
have
a
brother
named
brad
he
can
see
the
future
yeah
yeah
he
pawed
around
for
an
ashtray
and
discovered
that
it
had
been
removed
along
with
the
lighter
from
the
rental
dashboard
cursing
he
pinched
off
the
coal
of
the
cigarette
and
flicked
it
to
the
roadside
hoping
that
it
would
burn
out
quickly
then
he
tossed
the
butt
over
his
shoulder
at
the
back
seat
as
he
did
the
body
in
the
trunk
rolled
while
he
navigated
a
curve
in
the
road
and
he
braked
hard
getting
the
car
stopped
in
time
for
him
to
open
the
door
and
pitch
a
rush
of
vomit
onto
the
roadway
you
okay
to
drive
yeah
i
am
he
sat
up
and
put
the
car
into
gear
and
inched
to
the
shoulder
then
put
it
in
park
and
set
his
blinkers
the
car
smelled
of
sour
food
and
sharp
cigarettes
and
god
it
smelled
of
the
body
in
the
trunk
it
not
easy
to
be
precognizant
alan
said
and
pulled
back
onto
the
road
signaling
even
though
there
were
no
taillights
or
headlights
for
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
i
believe
it
she
said
he
stopped
telling
us
things
after
a
while
it
just
got
him
into
trouble
i
be
studying
for
an
exam
and
he
look
at
me
and
shake
his
head
slowly
sadly
then
i
flunk
out
and
i
be
convinced
that
it
was
him
psyching
me
out
or
he
get
picked
for
kickball
and
say
the
point
this
team
gon
na
lose
and
wander
off
and
they
lose
and
everyone
would
hate
him
he
could
tell
the
difference
between
what
he
knew
and
what
everyone
else
knew
did
know
the
difference
between
the
past
and
the
future
sometimes
so
he
stopped
telling
us
and
when
we
figured
out
how
to
read
it
in
his
eyes
he
stopped
looking
at
us
then
something
really
something
terrible
someone
i
cared
about
died
and
he
did
say
anything
about
it
i
could
have
stopped
it
prevented
it
i
could
have
saved
her
life
but
he
would
talk
he
drove
for
real
he
could
see
the
future
she
said
softly
her
voice
had
more
emotion
than
he
ever
heard
in
it
and
she
rolled
down
the
window
and
lit
another
cigarette
pluming
smoke
into
the
roar
of
the
wind
yeah
alan
said
future
or
future
i
never
figured
it
out
a
little
of
both
i
suppose
he
stopped
talking
huh
yeah
alan
said
i
know
what
that
like
mimi
said
i
had
spoken
more
than
three
words
in
the
six
months
before
i
met
krishna
i
worked
at
a
house
proofreading
the
mailing
labels
no
one
wanted
to
say
anything
to
me
and
i
just
wanted
to
disappear
it
was
soothing
in
a
way
reading
all
those
names
i
dropped
out
of
school
after
christmas
break
just
did
bother
going
back
again
never
paid
my
tuition
i
threw
away
my
houseplants
and
flushed
my
fish
down
the
toilet
so
that
there
be
any
living
thing
that
depended
on
me
she
worked
her
hand
between
his
thigh
and
the
seat
krishna
sat
next
to
me
on
the
subway
i
was
leaning
forward
because
my
wings
were
long
the
longest
they
ever
been
and
wearing
a
big
parka
over
them
he
leaned
forward
to
match
me
and
tapped
me
on
the
shoulder
i
turned
to
look
at
him
and
he
said
get
off
at
the
next
stop

get
off
with
me
and
have
a
cup
of
coffee

been
riding
next
to
you
on
the
subway
for
a
month
and
i
want
to
find
out
what

would
have
done

except
before
i
knew
what
i
was
doing
already
said
beg
your
pardon
because
i
was
sure
i
heard
him
right
and
once
i
said
that
once
i
spoken
i
could
bear
the
thought
of
not
speaking
again
they
blew
through
kapuskasing
at
ten
on
a
grey
morning
that
dawned
with
drizzle
and
clouds
low
overhead
the
little
main
drag
which
alan
remembered
as
a
bustling
center
of
commerce
where
waited
out
half
a
day
to
change
buses
was
deserted
the
only
evidence
of
habitation
the
occasional
car
pulling
through
a
donut
store
lane
jesus
who
divorced
me
this
time
mimi
said
ungumming
her
eyes
and
stuffing
a
fresh
cigarette
into
her
mouth
and
again
right
it
novel
she
said
what
about
the
oh
she
said
pfft
kerouac
was
a
martian
on
crank
dope
fiend
prose
is
fit
for
human
consumption
thompson
is
a
dope
fiend
no
that
was
just
a
he
wrote
drugs
not
drugs
have
you
kerouac
i
could
get
into
it
she
said
he
pulled
sharply
off
the
road
and
into
a
parking
lot
what
this
she
said
the
library
he
said
come
on
it
smelled
just
as
it
had
when
he
was
standing
among
the
aisles
of
the
biggest
collection
of
books
he
ever
seen
sweet
dusty
here
he
said
crossing
to
the
fiction
section
the
fiction
section
at
the
library
in
town
had
fit
into
three
spinner
racks
here
it
occupied
its
own
corner
of
overstuffed
bookcases
here
he
said
running
his
finger
down
the
plastic
brodart
wraps
on
the
spines
of
the
books
the
faded
dewey
labels
h
i
j
k
there
it
was
the
edition
he
remembered
from
all
those
years
ago
the
road
come
on
he
said
we
got
it
you
ca
check
that
out
she
said
he
pulled
out
his
wallet
as
they
drew
up
closer
to
the
checkout
counter
he
slid
out
the
plastic
id
holder
flipping
past
the
health
card
and
the
driver
license
not
a
very
good
likeness
of
his
face
or
his
name
on
either
and
then
produced
a
library
card
so
tattered
that
it
looked
like
a
pirate
map
on
parchment
he
slid
it
delicately
out
of
the
plastic
sleeve
unbending
the
frayed
corner
smoothing
the
feltlike
surface
of
the
card
the
furry
type
he
slid
the
card
and
the
book
across
the
counter
mimi
and
the
librarian
a
boy
of
possibly
mimi
age
who
wore
a
cap
just
like
his
patrons
but
at
a
certain
angle
that
suggested
urbane
irony
goggled
at
it
as
though
alan
had
slapped
down
a
museum
piece
the
boy
picked
it
up
with
such
roughness
that
alan
flinched
on
behalf
of
his
card
this
is
the
boy
began
it
a
library
card
alan
said
they
used
to
let
me
use
it
here
the
boy
set
it
down
on
the
counter
again
mimi
peered
at
it
there
no
name
on
that
card
she
said
never
needed
one
he
said
he
gotten
the
card
from
the
librarian
back
home
tricked
her
out
of
it
by
dragging
along
bradley
and
encouraging
him
to
waddle
off
into
the
shelves
and
start
pulling
down
books
she
rolled
it
into
her
typewriter
and
then
they
both
gone
chasing
after
brad
then
asked
him
again
for
his
name
and
they
gone
chasing
after
brad
then
for
his
address
and
then
brad
again
eventually
he
was
able
to
simply
snitch
it
out
of
the
platen
of
the
humming
selectric
and
walk
out
no
one
ever
looked
closely
at
it
again
not
even
the
thoroughly
professional
staffers
at
the
kapuskasing
branch
who
let
him
take
out
a
stack
of
books
to
read
in
the
bus
station
overnight
while
he
waited
for
the
morning
bus
to
toronto
he
picked
up
the
card
again
then
set
it
down
it
was
the
first
piece
of
identification
he
ever
owned
and
in
some
ways
the
most
important
i
have
to
give
you
a
new
card
the
kid
said
with
a
bar
code
we
do
take
that
card
anymore
he
picked
it
up
and
made
to
tear
it
in
half
no
alan
roared
and
lunged
over
the
counter
to
seize
the
wrists
the
kid
startled
back
and
reflexively
tore
at
the
card
but
alan
iron
grip
on
his
wrists
kept
him
from
completing
the
motion
the
kid
dropped
the
card
and
it
fluttered
to
the
carpet
behind
the
counter
give
it
to
me
alan
said
the
boy
eyes
wide
with
shock
began
to
screw
shut
with
pain
alan
let
go
his
wrists
and
the
kid
chafed
them
backing
away
another
step
his
shout
had
drawn
older
librarians
from
receiving
areas
and
offices
behind
the
counter
women
with
the
look
of
persons
accustomed
to
terminating
children
mischief
and
ejecting
rowdy
drunks
with
equal
aplomb
one
of
them
was
talking
into
a
phone
and
two
more
were
moving
cautiously
toward
them
sizing
them
up
we
should
go
mimi
said
i
need
my
library
card
he
said
and
was
as
surprised
as
anyone
at
the
pout
in
his
voice
a
sound
that
was
about
six
years
old
stubborn
and
wounded
mimi
looked
hard
at
him
then
at
the
librarians
converging
on
them
then
at
the
mesh
back
kid
who
had
backed
all
the
way
up
to
a
work
surface
several
paces
back
of
him
she
planted
her
palms
on
the
counter
and
swung
one
foot
up
onto
it
vaulting
herself
over
alan
saw
the
back
of
her
man
jacket
bulge
out
behind
her
as
her
wings
tried
to
spread
when
she
took
to
the
air
she
snatched
up
the
card
then
planted
her
hands
again
and
leapt
into
the
air
the
toe
of
her
trailing
foot
caught
the
edge
of
the
counter
and
she
began
to
tumble
headed
for
a
into
the
industrial
carpet
alan
had
the
presence
of
mind
to
catch
her
her
tit
crashing
into
his
head
and
gentle
her
to
the
floor
we
going
mimi
said
now
alan
hardly
knew
where
he
was
anymore
the
card
was
in
mimi
hand
though
and
he
reached
for
it
making
a
keening
noise
deep
in
his
throat
here
she
said
handing
it
to
him
when
he
touched
the
felted
card
stock
he
snapped
back
to
himself
sorry
he
said
lamely
to
the
kid
mimi
yanked
his
arm
and
they
jumped
into
the
car
and
he
fumbled
the
key
into
the
ignition
fumbled
the
car
to
life
his
head
felt
like
a
balloon
on
the
end
of
a
taut
string
floating
some
yards
above
his
body
he
gunned
the
engine
and
the
body
rolled
in
the
trunk
he
forgotten
about
it
for
a
while
in
the
library
and
now
he
remembered
it
again
maybe
he
felt
something
then
a
twitchy
twinge
of
grief
but
he
swallowed
hard
and
it
went
away
the
of
the
wheels
going
over
the
curb
as
he
missed
the
back
out
onto
the
road
mimi
sucking
breath
in
a
hiss
as
he
narrowly
avoided
getting
by
a
pickup
truck
and
then
the
hum
of
the
road
under
his
wheels
alan
mimi
said
it
was
my
first
piece
of
identification
he
said
it
made
me
a
person
who
could
get
a
book
out
of
the
library
they
drove
on
heading
for
the
city
limits
at
a
few
klicks
over
the
speed
limit
fast
lots
of
green
lights
what
did
i
just
say
alan
said
you
said
it
was
your
first
piece
of
id
mimi
said
she
was
twitching
worriedly
in
the
passenger
seat
alan
realized
that
she
was
steering
and
braking
an
invisible
set
of
controls
as
he
veered
around
the
traffic
you
said
it
made
you
a
person
that
right
alan
said
it
did
he
never
understood
how
he
came
to
be
enrolled
in
kindergarten
even
in
those
late
days
there
were
still
any
number
of
nearby
farm
folk
whose
literacy
was
so
fragile
that
they
could
be
intimidated
out
of
it
by
a
sheaf
of
school
enrollment
forms
maybe
that
was
it
the
alan
turning
up
at
the
school
with
his
oddly
accented
english
and
his
martian
wardrobe
of
pieces
rescued
from
roadside
ditches
and
snitched
off
of
clotheslines
and
who
was
going
to
send
him
home
on
the
first
day
of
school
surely
the
paperwork
would
get
sorted
out
by
the
time
the
first
field
trip
rolled
around
or
possibly
by
the
time
vaccination
forms
were
due
and
then
it
just
fell
by
the
wayside
alan
got
the
rest
of
his
brothers
enrolled
taking
their
forms
home
and
forging
indecipherable
scrawls
that
satisfied
the
office
ladies
his
own
enrollment
never
came
up
in
any
serious
way
permission
slips
were
easy
inoculations
could
be
had
at
the
clinic
once
a
year
at
the
fire
house
until
he
was
eight
being
undocumented
was
no
big
deal
none
of
his
classmates
carried
id
but
his
classmates
have
big
wheels
catcher
mitts
batmobiles
action
figures
fonzie
lunchboxes
and
kodiak
boots
they
had
parents
who
came
to
parents
night
and
sent
trays
of
cupcakes
to
class
on
birthdays
alan
birthday
came
during
the
summer
by
necessity
so
that
this
would
be
an
issue
so
did
his
brothers
when
their
time
came
to
enroll
at
eight
he
ducked
religiously
and
skillfully
but
one
day
he
got
caught
out
and
with
all
the
eyes
in
the
room
boring
into
him
as
he
fumfuhed
at
the
front
of
the
classroom
and
the
teacher
thought
he
was
being
kind
by
pointing
out
that
his
spring
moccasins
a
tithe
of
the
golems
were
fit
subject
for
a
brief
exposition
did
your
mom
buy
you
any
real
shoes
it
was
asked
without
malice
or
calculation
but
alan
flustered
hot
stammer
chummed
the
waters
and
the
class
sharks
were
on
him
fast
and
hard
previously
invisible
he
was
now
the
subject
of
relentless
scrutiny
previously
an
observer
of
the
playground
he
was
now
a
nexus
of
it
a
place
where
attention
focused
hunting
out
the
accent
the
strange
lunch
the
odd
looks
and
gaps
in
knowledge
of
the
world
he
thought
figured
out
how
to
fit
in
that
he
observed
people
to
the
point
that
he
could
be
one
but
he
was
so
wrong
they
watched
him
until
easter
break
when
school
let
out
and
they
disappeared
back
into
the
unknowable
depths
of
their
neat
houses
and
when
they
saw
him
on
the
street
headed
for
a
shop
or
moping
on
a
bench
they
cocked
their
heads
quizzically
at
him
as
if
to
say
i
know
you
from
somewhere
or
if
he
was
feeling
generous
wonder
where
you
live
the
latter
was
scarier
than
the
former
for
his
part
he
was
heartsick
that
he
turned
out
not
to
be
half
so
clever
as
he
fancied
himself
there
was
much
money
around
the
mountain
that
season
the
flakes
he
brought
down
to
the
assayer
had
been
converted
into
cash
for
new
shoes
for
the
younger
kids
and
chocolate
bars
that
he
brought
to
fill
bradley
little
round
belly
he
missed
the
school
library
achingly
during
that
week
and
it
was
that
lack
that
drove
him
to
the
town
library
he
walked
past
the
squat
brown
brick
building
hundreds
of
times
but
had
never
crossed
its
threshold
he
had
a
sense
that
he
was
welcome
there
that
it
was
not
intended
for
his
consumption
he
slunk
in
like
a
stray
dog
hid
himself
in
the
back
shelves
and
read
books
at
random
while
he
observed
the
other
patrons
coming
and
going
it
took
three
days
of
this
for
him
to
arrive
at
his
strategy
for
getting
his
own
library
card
and
the
plan
worked
flawlessly
bradley
pulled
the
books
off
the
back
shelves
for
the
final
time
the
librarian
turned
in
exasperation
for
the
final
time
and
he
was
off
and
out
with
the
card
in
his
hand
before
the
librarian
had
turned
back
again
credentialed
he
read
the
word
in
a
book
of
war
stories
he
liked
the
sound
of
it
what
did
krishna
do
what
do
you
mean
she
was
looking
at
him
guardedly
now
but
his
madness
seemed
to
have
past
i
mean
he
said
reaching
over
and
taking
her
hand
what
did
krishna
do
when
you
went
out
for
coffee
with
him
oh
she
said
she
was
quiet
while
they
drove
a
narrow
road
over
a
steep
hill
he
made
me
laugh
he
does
seem
that
funny
alan
said
we
went
out
to
this
coffee
shop
in
little
italy
and
he
sat
me
down
at
a
tiny
green
metal
table
even
though
it
was
still
cold
as
hell
and
he
brought
out
tiny
cups
of
espresso
and
a
little
bag
of
biscotti
then
he
watched
the
people
and
made
little
remarks
about
them
a
little
old
to
be
breeding
or
is
that
how
wearing
their
eyebrow
in
the
old
country
or
like
he
beats
his
wife
with
his
slipper
for
not
fixing
his
kraft
dinner
right
and
when
he
said
it
i
it
was
just
a
mean
little
remark
i
it
was
true
somehow
he
could
look
at
these
people
and
know
what
they
were
about
what
their
fears
were
what
their
little
secrets
were
and
he
made
me
laugh
even
though
it
did
take
long
before
i
guessed
that
that
meant
that
he
might
know
my
secret
so
we
drank
our
coffee
she
said
and
then
stopped
when
the
body
thudded
in
the
trunk
again
when
they
caught
some
air
at
the
top
of
a
hill
we
drank
it
and
he
reached
across
the
table
and
tickled
my
open
palm
with
his
fingertips
and
he
said
did
you
come
out
with
me
and
i
mumbled
and
blushed
and
said
something
like
look
like
a
nice
guy
it
just
coffee
shit
do
make
a
big
deal
out
of
it
and
he
looked
like
i
just
canceled
christmas
and
said
well
too
bad
i
was
hoping
it
was
a
big
deal
that
it
was
because
you
thought
be
a
good
guy
to
really
hang
out
with
a
if
you
know
what
i
mean
he
tickled
my
palm
again
i
was
a
blushing
virgin
literally
though
had
a
couple
boys
maybe
possibly
flirt
with
me
in
school
i
never
returned
the
signals
never
could
i
told
him
i
did
think
i
could
be
romantically
involved
with
him
and
he
flattened
out
his
palm
so
that
my
hand
was
pinned
to
the
table
under
it
and
he
said
it
your
deformity
do
let
that
bother
you
i
thought
i
could
fix
that
for
you
i
almost
pretended
i
know
what
he
meant
but
i
could
really
i
knew
he
knew
i
knew
i
said
as
in
did
you
and
can
you
fix
but
it
just
came
out
in
a
little
squeak
and
he
grinned
like
christmas
was
back
on
and
said
it
really
matter
i
told
him
it
did
and
then
we
went
back
to
his
place
in
kensington
market
and
he
kissed
me
in
the
living
room
then
he
took
me
upstairs
to
the
bathroom
and
took
off
my
shirt
and
he
he
cut
you
alan
said
he
fixed
me
she
said
alan
reached
out
and
petted
her
wings
through
her
jacket
were
you
broken
of
i
was
she
snapped
pulling
back
i
could
to
people
i
could
anything
i
was
a
person
she
said
right
alan
said
i
following
you
she
looked
glumly
at
the
road
unraveling
before
them
grey
and
hissing
with
rain
is
it
much
farther
she
said
an
hour
or
so
if
i
remember
right
he
said
i
know
how
stupid
that
sounds
she
said
i
could
figure
out
if
he
was
some
kind
of
pervert
who
liked
to
cut
or
if
he
was
some
kind
of
pervert
who
liked
girls
like
me
or
if
i
was
lucky
or
in
trouble
but
he
cut
them
and
he
gave
me
a
towel
to
bite
on
the
first
time
but
i
never
needed
it
after
that
he
do
it
quick
and
he
kept
the
knife
sharp
and
i
was
able
to
be
a
person
again
to
wear
cute
clothes
and
go
where
i
wanted
it
was
like
my
life
had
started
over
again
the
hills
loomed
over
the
horizon
now
low
and
rolling
up
toward
the
mountains
one
of
them
was
his
he
sucked
in
a
breath
and
the
car
wavered
on
the
slick
road
he
pumped
the
brakes
and
coasted
them
to
a
stop
on
the
shoulder
is
that
it
she
said
that
it
he
said
he
pointed
his
father
was
green
and
craggy
and
smaller
than
he
remembered
the
body
rolled
in
the
trunk
i
feel
he
said
we
taking
him
home
at
least
and
my
father
will
know
what
to
do
no
boy
has
ever
taken
me
home
to
meet
his
folks
she
said
alan
remembered
the
little
fist
in
the
dirt
you
can
wait
in
the
car
if
you
want
he
said
krishna
came
home
she
said
as
they
sat
in
the
parked
car
at
a
wide
spot
in
the
highway
looking
at
the
mountains
on
the
horizon
krishna
came
home
she
said
after
he
pulled
off
the
road
abruptly
put
the
car
into
park
and
stared
emptily
at
the
mountains
ahead
of
them
krishna
came
home
she
said
lighting
a
cigarette
and
rolling
down
the
window
and
letting
the
shush
of
the
passing
cars
come
fill
the
car
and
she
did
look
at
him
because
the
expression
on
his
face
was
too
terrible
to
behold
and
he
came
through
the
door
with
two
bags
of
groceries
and
a
bottle
of
wine
under
one
arm
and
two
bags
from
a
ravewear
shop
on
queen
street
that
i
walked
past
a
hundred
times
but
never
gone
into
he
left
me
in
his
apartment
that
morning
with
his
television
and
his
books
and
his
guitar
told
me
to
make
myself
at
home
told
me
to
call
in
sick
to
work
told
me
to
take
a
day
for
myself
i
felt
gloried
he
been
so
attentive
he
touched
me
no
one
had
touched
me
in
so
long
no
one
had
touched
me
that
way
he
touched
me
with
he
gotten
this
expression
on
his
face
like
like
he
was
in
or
something
he
kept
breathing
something
too
low
for
me
to
hear
and
when
he
put
his
lips
right
to
my
ear
i
heard
what
he
been
saying
all
along
oh
god
oh
god
my
god
oh
god
and
i
felt
a
warmness
like
slow
honey
start
in
my
toes
and
rise
through
me
like
sap
to
the
roots
of
my
hair
so
that
i
felt
like
i
was
saturated
with
something
hot
and
sweet
and
delicious
he
came
home
that
night
with
the
makings
of
a
huge
dinner
with
boiled
crabs
and
a
bottle
of
completely
decent
chilean
red
and
three
dresses
for
me
that
i
could
never
ever
wear
i
tried
to
keep
the
disappointment
off
my
face
as
he
pulled
them
out
of
the
bag
because
i
they
never
go
on
over
my
wings
and
they
were
beautiful
this
one
will
look
really
good
on
you
he
said
holding
up
a
heidi
dress
with
a
scoop
neck
that
was
cut
low
across
the
back
and
i
felt
a
hot
tear
in
the
corner
of
my
eye
i
never
wear
that
dress
in
front
of
anyone
but
him
i
could
my
wings
would
stick
out
a
mile
i
knew
what
it
meant
to
be
different
it
meant
living
in
the
second
floor
with
the
old
russian
auntie
away
from
the
crowds
and
their
eyes
i
knew
then
what
i
was
getting
in
for
the
rest
of
my
life
spent
hidden
away
from
the
world
with
only
this
man
to
see
and
speak
to
i
been
out
in
the
world
for
only
a
few
years
and
i
had
barely
touched
it
moving
in
silence
and
stealth
watching
and
not
being
seen
but
oh
i
had
i
realized
i
thought
i
hated
it
but
i
loved
it
loved
the
people
and
their
dialogue
and
their
clothes
and
their
mysterious
errands
and
the
shops
full
of
goods
and
every
shopper
hunting
for
something
for
someone
every
one
of
them
part
of
a
story
that
i
would
never
be
part
of
but
i
could
be
the
stories
and
that
was
enough
i
was
going
to
live
in
an
attic
again
i
started
to
cry
he
came
to
me
he
put
his
arms
around
me
he
nuzzled
my
throat
and
licked
up
the
tears
as
they
slid
past
my
chin
shhh
he
said
shhh
he
took
off
my
jacket
and
my
sweater
peeled
down
my
jeans
and
my
panties
and
ran
his
fingertips
over
me
stroking
me
until
i
quietened
he
touched
me
reverently
still
his
breath
hot
on
my
skin
no
one
had
ever
touched
me
like
that
he
said
i
can
fix
you
i
said
no
one
can
fix
me
he
said
i
can
but
you
have
to
be
brave
i
nodded
slowly
i
could
do
brave
he
led
me
by
the
hand
into
the
bathroom
and
he
took
a
towel
down
off
of
the
hook
on
the
back
of
the
door
and
folded
it
into
a
long
strip
he
handed
it
to
me
bite
down
on
this
he
said
and
helped
me
stand
in
the
tub
and
face
into
the
corner
to
count
the
grid
of
tiles
and
the
greenish
mildew
in
the
grout
hold
still
and
bite
down
he
said
and
i
heard
the
door
close
behind
me
reverent
fingertips
on
my
wing
unfolding
it
holding
it
away
from
my
body
be
brave
he
said
and
then
he
cut
off
my
wing
it
hurt
so
much
i
pitched
forward
involuntarily
and
cracked
my
head
against
the
tile
it
hurt
so
much
i
bit
through
two
thicknesses
of
towel
it
hurt
so
much
my
legs
went
to
mush
and
i
began
to
sit
down
quickly
like
i
was
fainting
he
caught
me
under
my
armpits
and
held
me
up
and
i
felt
something
icy
pressed
to
where
my
wing
had
been
i
closed
my
eyes
but
i
heard
the
leathery
thump
as
my
wing
hit
the
tile
floor
a
wet
sound
and
gauzy
fabric
was
wrapped
around
my
chest
holding
the
icy
towel
in
place
over
the
wound
once
twice
thrice
between
my
tits
hold
still
he
said
and
he
cut
off
the
other
one
i
screamed
this
time
because
he
brushed
the
wound
he
left
the
first
time
but
i
managed
to
stay
upright
and
to
not
crack
my
head
on
anything
i
felt
myself
crying
but
could
hear
it
i
could
hear
anything
nothing
except
a
high
sound
in
my
ears
like
a
dog
whistle
he
kissed
my
cheek
after
he
wound
a
second
bandage
holding
a
second
cold
compress
over
my
second
wound
you
a
very
brave
girl
he
said
come
on
he
led
me
into
the
living
room
where
he
pulled
the
cushions
off
his
sofa
and
opened
it
up
to
reveal
a
he
helped
me
lie
down
on
my
belly
and
arranged
pillows
around
me
and
under
my
head
so
that
i
was
facing
the
tv
i
got
you
movies
he
said
and
held
up
a
stack
of
dvd
rental
boxes
from
martian
signal
we
got
in
blues
princess
a
robin
williams
tape
and
a
really
porno
called
i
had
to
smile
in
spite
of
myself
in
spite
of
the
pain
he
stepped
into
his
kitchenette
and
came
back
with
a
box
of
chocolates
truffles
he
said
so
you
can
laze
on
the
sofa
eating
bonbons
i
smiled
more
widely
then
such
a
beautiful
smile
he
said
want
a
cup
of
coffee
no
i
said
choking
it
out
past
my
throat
all
right
he
said
which
video
do
you
want
to
watch
i
said
i
had
heard
of
any
of
them
but
i
want
to
admit
it
you
do
want
to
start
with
edward
penishands
alan
stood
out
front
of
the
video
shop
for
a
while
watching
natalie
wait
on
her
customers
she
was
friendly
without
being
perky
and
it
was
clear
that
the
mostly
male
clientele
had
a
bit
of
a
crush
on
her
as
did
her
mooning
who
was
too
distracted
to
efficiently
shelve
the
videos
he
pulled
from
the
box
before
him
alan
smiled
hiring
cute
girls
for
your
shop
was
tricky
business
if
they
had
brains
sell
the
hell
out
of
your
stock
and
be
entertaining
as
hell
but
a
lot
of
pretty
girls
and
boys
had
gotten
a
free
ride
in
life
and
got
affronted
when
you
asked
them
to
do
any
real
work
natalie
was
clearly
efficient
and
alan
knew
that
she
was
afraid
of
hard
work
but
it
was
good
to
see
her
doing
her
thing
quickly
and
efficiently
taking
people
money
answering
their
questions
handing
them
receipts
counting
out
change
he
would
have
loved
to
have
had
someone
like
her
working
for
him
in
one
of
his
shops
once
the
little
rush
at
the
counter
was
cleared
he
eased
himself
into
the
shop
natalie
working
for
him
of
course
in
the
impromptu
assembly
line
in
kurt
storefront
she
proven
herself
to
be
as
efficient
at
assembling
and
testing
the
access
points
as
she
was
at
running
the
till
alan
she
said
smiling
broadly
her
turned
and
scowled
jealously
at
him
i
going
on
break
okay
she
said
to
him
ignoring
his
sour
puss
what
now
he
said
petulantly
no
i
thought
i
wait
until
we
got
busy
again
she
said
not
unkindly
and
smiled
at
him
i
be
back
in
ten
she
said
she
came
around
the
counter
with
her
cigs
in
one
hand
and
her
lighter
in
the
other
coffee
she
said
absolutely
he
said
and
led
her
up
the
street
you
liking
the
job
he
said
it
better
now
she
said
i
been
bringing
home
two
or
three
movies
every
night
and
watching
them
just
to
get
to
know
the
stock
and
i
put
on
different
things
in
the
store
the
kind
of
thing
i
never
have
watched
before
old
horror
movies
tentacle
porn
crappy
epics
so
now
they
all
bow
to
me
that
great
alan
said
and
kurt
tells
me
you
been
doing
amazing
work
with
him
too
oh
that
just
fun
she
said
i
went
along
on
a
couple
of
dumpster
runs
with
the
gang
i
found
the
most
amazing
cosmetics
baskets
at
the
shiseido
dumpster
never
would
have
thought
that
i
go
in
for
that
girly
stuff
but
when
you
get
it
for
free
out
of
the
trash
it
feels
pretty
macha
smell
she
said
tilting
her
head
and
stretching
her
neck
he
sniffed
cautiously
very
macha
he
said
he
realized
that
the
other
patrons
in
the
shop
were
eyeballing
him
a
man
with
his
face
buried
in
this
throat
he
remembered
suddenly
that
he
still
had
put
in
a
call
to
get
her
a
job
somewhere
else
and
was
smitten
with
guilt
hey
he
said
damn
i
was
supposed
to
call
and
see
about
getting
you
a
job
i
do
it
right
away
he
pulled
a
little
steno
pad
out
of
his
pocket
and
started
jotting
down
a
note
to
himself
she
put
her
hand
out
oh
that
okay
she
said
i
really
like
this
job
i
been
looking
up
all
my
old
high
school
friends
you
were
right
everyone
i
ever
knew
has
an
account
with
martian
signal
god
you
should
the
movies
they
rent
you
keep
that
on
file
huh
sure
everything
it
creepy
do
you
need
that
much
info
well
we
need
to
know
who
took
a
tape
out
last
if
someone
returns
it
and
says
that
it
broken
or
recorded
over
or
whatever
so
you
need
what
the
last
couple
months
worth
of
rentals
something
like
that
maybe
longer
for
the
weirder
tapes
they
only
get
checked
out
once
a
year
or
so
so
maybe
you
keep
the
last
two
names
associated
with
each
tape
that
work
you
should
do
that
she
snorted
and
drank
her
coffee
i
do
have
any
say
in
it
tell
your
boss
he
said
it
how
good
ideas
happen
in
business
people
working
at
the
cash
register
figure
stuff
out
and
they
tell
their
bosses
so
i
should
just
tell
my
boss
that
i
think
we
should
change
our
whole
rental
system
because
it
creepy
damned
right
tell
him
it
creepy
you
keeping
information
you
do
need
to
keep
and
paying
to
store
it
you
keeping
information
that
cops
or
snoops
or
other
people
could
take
advantage
of
and
keeping
information
that
your
customers
almost
certainly
assume
not
keeping
all
of
those
are
good
reasons
to
keep
that
information
trust
me
on
this
one
bosses
love
to
hear
suggestions
from
people
who
work
for
them
it
shows
that
you
engaged
paying
attention
to
their
business
god
now
i
feel
guilty
for
snooping
well
maybe
you
do
mention
to
your
boss
that
you
been
spending
a
lot
of
time
looking
through
rental
histories
she
laughed
god
he
liked
working
with
young
people
so
why
here
he
said
yes
i
want
to
put
an
access
point
in
the
window
and
around
back
of
the
shop
your
boss
owns
the
building
right
yeah
but
i
really
do
think
i
can
explain
all
this
stuff
to
him
i
do
need
you
to
i
just
need
you
to
introduce
me
to
him
i
do
all
the
explaining
she
blushed
a
little
i
do
know
abe
she
trailed
off
is
that
a
problem
no
yes
i
do
know
she
looked
distressed
suddenly
he
was
at
sea
he
felt
like
he
was
in
charge
of
this
interaction
like
he
understood
what
was
going
on
he
carefully
rehearsed
what
he
was
going
to
say
and
what
natalie
was
likely
to
say
and
now
she
was
what
afraid
to
introduce
him
to
her
boss
because
why
because
the
boss
was
an
ogre
then
she
would
have
pushed
back
harder
when
he
told
her
to
talk
to
him
about
the
rental
records
because
she
was
shy
natalie
was
shy
because
i
do
it
she
said
sorry
i
was
being
stupid
it
just
you
come
on
a
little
strong
sometimes
my
boss
i
get
the
feeling
that
he
does
like
it
when
people
come
on
strong
with
him
ah
he
thought
she
was
nervous
because
he
was
so
goddamned
weird
well
there
you
had
it
he
could
even
get
sad
about
it
story
of
his
life
really
thanks
for
the
tip
he
said
what
if
i
assure
you
that
i
come
on
easy
she
blushed
it
had
really
been
awkward
for
her
then
he
felt
bad
okay
she
said
sure
sorry
man
he
held
up
a
hand
it
nothing
he
followed
her
back
to
the
store
and
he
bought
a
tin
robot
made
out
of
a
pepsi
can
by
some
artisan
in
vietnam
who
endowed
it
with
huge
tin
testicles
it
made
him
laugh
when
he
got
home
he
scanned
and
filed
the
receipt
took
a
picture
and
entered
it
into
the
inventory
and
by
the
time
he
was
done
he
was
feeling
much
better
they
got
into
kurt
car
at
five
just
as
the
sun
was
beginning
to
set
the
sun
hung
on
the
horizon
at
eye
level
for
an
eternity
slicing
up
their
eyeballs
and
into
their
brains
summer
coming
on
alan
said
and
we
barely
got
the
market
covered
kurt
said
at
this
rate
it
take
ten
years
to
cover
the
whole
city
alan
shrugged
it
the
journey
dude
not
the
destination
the
act
of
organizing
all
these
people
of
putting
up
the
aps
of
advancing
the
art

all
worthwhile
in
and
of
itself
kurt
shook
his
head

said

said
and
nudged
the
car
through
traffic
and
on
to
the
don
valley
parkway
where
the
hell
are
we
alan
said
once
they
left
the
city
limits
and
entered
the
curved
identical
streets
of
the
industrial
suburbs

the
north
end
place

anonymous
sprawling
brown
building
they
print
hockey
cards
baseball
cards
monster
cards

he
sipped
at
his
coffee
and
then
rolled
down
the
window
and
spat
it
out
shit
that
was
last
night
coffee
he
said
so
one
night
i
was
diving
there
and
i
found
i
dunno
fifty
a
hundred
boxes
of
hockey
cards
slightly
dented
at
the
corners
in
the
trash
i
mean
hockey
cards
are
just
right
the
only
thing
that
makes
them
valuable
is
the
companies
infusing
them
with
marketing
juju
and
glossy
pictures
of
jocks
tell
me
how
you
really
feel
alan
said
sorry
kurt
said
the
hockey
players
in
junior
high
were
real
jerks
i
mentally
scarred
so
i
driving
away
and
the
law
pulls
me
over
the
local
cops
they
know
me
mostly
i
phone
in
b
es
when
i
spot
them
but
these
guys
had
never
met
me
before
so
they
get
me
out
of
the
car
and
i
explain
what
i
was
doing
and
i
quote
the
part
of
the
trespass
to
property
act
that
says
that
i
allowed
to
do
what
i
doing
and
then
i
open
the
trunk
and
i
show
him
and
he
busts
a
mean
you
found
these
in
the
my
kid
spends
a
fortune
on
these
things
in
the
he
keeps
saying
the
garbage
and
his
partner
leads
him
away
and
i
put
it
behind
me
but
then
a
couple
nights
later
i
go
back
and
there
someone
in
the
dumpster
up
to
his
nipples
in
hockey
cards
the
cop
alan
said
the
cop
kurt
said
right
that
the
story
about
the
cop
in
the
dumpster
huh
alan
said
that
the
story
the
moral
is
we
all
only
a
away
from
jumping
in
the
dumpster
and
getting
down
in
it
i
thought
you
were
trying
not
to
be
sexist
stands
for
okay
alan
grinned
he
and
kurt
had
had
an
evening
chatting
together
in
some
time
when
kurt
suggested
that
they
go
for
a
ride
alan
had
been
reluctant
too
much
on
his
mind
those
days
too
much
on
his
mind
but
this
was
just
what
he
needed
what
they
both
needed
okay
alan
said
we
going
to
eat
we
going
to
eat
kurt
said
the
vietnamese
place
is
just
up
ahead
i
once
heard
a
guy
there
trying
to
speak
thai
to
the
waiters
it
was
amazing
it
was
like
he
was
a
tourist
even
at
home
an
ugly
tourist
people
suck
do
they
alan
said
i
quite
like
them
you
know
there
pretty
good
vietnamese
in
chinatown
this
is
good
vietnamese
better
than
chinatown
better
situated
kurt
said
if
you
going
dumpster
diving
afterward
i
gon
na
take
your
cherry
buddy
he
clapped
a
hand
on
alan
shoulder
real
people
did
touch
alan
much
he
did
know
if
he
liked
it
god
alan
said
this
is
so
sudden
but
he
was
happy
about
it
tried
to
picture
what
kurt
actually
any
number
of
times
but
he
was
never
very
successful
now
he
was
going
to
actually
go
out
and
jump
in
and
out
of
the
garbage
he
wondered
if
he
was
dressed
for
it
picturing
bags
of
stinky
kitchen
waste
and
decided
that
he
was
willing
to
sacrifice
his
jeans
and
the
old
gap
shirt
he
bought
one
day
after
the
shirt
he
worn
to
the
store
the
toy
store
got
soaked
in
a
cloudburst
the
vietnamese
food
was
really
good
and
the
family
who
ran
the
restaurant
greeted
kurt
like
an
old
friend
the
place
was
crawling
with
cops
a
new
two
or
three
every
couple
minutes
stopping
by
to
grab
a
salad
roll
or
a
sandwich
or
a
of
pho
cops
always
know
where
to
eat
fast
and
cheap
and
good
kurt
mumbled
around
a
mouthful
of
pork
chop
and
fried
rice
that
how
i
found
this
place
all
the
cop
cars
in
the
parking
lot
alan
slurped
up
the
last
of
his
pho
and
chased
down
the
remaining
hunks
of
rare
beef
with
his
chopsticks
and
dipped
them
in
chili
sauce
before
popping
them
in
his
mouth
where
are
we
going
he
asked
kurt
jerked
his
head
in
the
direction
of
the
great
outdoors
wherever
the
fates
take
us
i
just
drive
until
i
get
an
itch
and
then
i
pull
into
a
parking
lot
and
hit
the
dumpsters
there
enough
dumpsters
out
this
way
i
could
spend
fifty
or
sixty
hours
going
through
them
all
so
got
to
be
selective
i
know
how
each
company
trash
has
been
running
lots
of
good
stuff
or
mostly
crap
lately
and
i
trust
my
intuition
to
take
me
to
the
right
places
i
love
to
go
to
the
sega
or
nintendo
dumpsters
but
they
like
stalag
thirteen
razorwire
and
and
armed
guards
they
the
only
companies
that
take
secrecy
seriously
suddenly
he
changed
lanes
and
pulled
up
the
driveway
of
an
industrial
complex
is
tingling
he
said
as
he
killed
his
lights
and
crept
forward
to
the
dumpster
ready
to
lose
your
virginity
he
said
lighting
a
cigarette
i
wish
you
stop
using
that
metaphor
alan
said
ick
but
kurt
was
already
out
of
the
buick
around
the
other
side
of
the
car
pulling
open
alan
door
that
dumpster
is
full
of
cardboard
he
said
gesturing
recycling
that
one
is
full
of
plastic
bottles
more
recycling
this
one
he
said
as
he
levered
himself
over
it
talking
around
the
maglight
he
clenched
between
his
teeth
is
where
they
put
the
good
stuff
looky
here
alan
tried
to
climb
the
dumpster
sticky
walls
but
could
get
a
purchase
kurt
standing
on
something
in
the
dumpster
that
crackled
reached
down
and
grabbed
him
by
the
wrist
and
hoisted
him
up
he
scrambled
over
the
dumpster
transom
and
fell
into
it
expecting
a
wash
of
sour
kitchen
waste
to
break
over
him
and
finding
himself
instead
amid
hundreds
of
cardboard
boxes
what
this
he
asked
kurt
was
picking
up
the
boxes
and
shaking
them
listening
for
the
rattle
this
place
is
an
wholesaler
they
throw
out
a
lot
of
defective
product
since
it
cheaper
than
shipping
it
all
back
to
taiwan
for
service
but
my
kids
will
fix
it
and
sell
it
on
ebay
here
he
said
opening
a
box
and
shaking
something
out
handing
it
to
him
he
passed
his
light
over
to
alan
who
took
it
unmindful
of
the
drool
on
the
handle
it
was
a
rubber
duckie
alan
turned
it
over
and
saw
it
had
a
hard
chunk
of
metal
growing
out
of
its
ass
more
of
these
huh
kurt
said
i
found
about
a
thousand
of
these
last
month
they
usb
keychain
drives
like
plug
them
in
and
they
show
up
on
your
desktop
like
a
little
hard
drive
they
light
up
in
all
kinds
of
different
colors
the
problem
is
they
all
got
a
manufacturing
defect
that
makes
them
glow
in
just
one
color
whatever
shade
the
little
gel
carousel
gets
stuck
on
i
got
a
couple
thousand
of
these
back
home
but
they
selling
briskly
go
get
me
a
couple
cardboard
boxes
from
that
dumpster
there
and
we
snag
a
couple
hundred
more
alan
gawped
the
dumpster
was
seven
feet
cubed
the
duckies
a
few
inches
on
a
side
there
were
thousands
and
thousands
of
duckies
in
the
dumpster
more
than
they
could
ever
fit
into
the
buick
in
a
daze
he
went
off
and
pulled
some
likely
flattened
boxes
out
of
the
trash
and
assembled
them
packing
them
with
the
duckies
that
kurt
passed
down
to
him
from
atop
his
crunching
cracking
mound
of
doomed
duckies
that
he
was
grinding
underfoot
once
they
finished
kurt
fussed
with
moving
the
boxes
around
so
that
everything
with
a
bootprint
was
shuffled
to
the
bottom
we
do
want
them
to
know
that
we
been
here
or
they
start
hitting
the
duckies
with
a
hammer
before
they
pitch
out
he
climbed
into
the
car
and
pulled
out
a
bottle
of
window
cleaner
and
some
paper
towels
and
wiped
off
the
steering
wheel
and
the
dash
and
the
handle
of
his
flashlight
then
worked
a
blob
of
hand
sanitizer
into
his
palms
passing
it
to
alan
when
he
was
done
alan
did
bother
to
point
out
that
as
kurt
had
worked
transferred
the
flashlight
from
his
mouth
to
his
hands
and
back
again
a
dozen
times
he
thought
he
understood
that
this
ritual
was
about
kurt
assuring
himself
that
he
was
not
sinking
down
to
the
level
of
rummies
and
other
garbage
pickers
as
if
reading
his
mind
kurt
said
you
see
those
old
pushing
a
shopping
cart
filled
with
empty
cans
down
spadina
fucking
they
could
be
out
here
pulling
lcds
that
they
could
turn
around
for
ten
bucks
a
pop
but
instead
they
rooting
around
like
raccoons
in
the
trash
chasing
after
nickel
deposits
but
then
what
would
you
pick
kurt
stared
at
him
you
kidding
me
did
you
there
a
hundred
times
more
stuff
than
i
could
ever
pull
christ
if
even
one
of
them
had
a
squint
of
ambition
we
could
the
amount
we
save
from
the
trash
you
an
extraordinary
person
alan
said
he
was
sure
he
meant
it
as
a
compliment
after
all
was
an
extraordinary
person
too
alan
was
stunned
when
they
found
a
dozen
hard
drives
that
spun
up
and
revealed
themselves
to
be
of
generous
capacity
and
moreover
stuffed
with
confidential
looking
information
when
he
plugged
them
into
the
laptop
that
kurt
kept
under
the
passenger
seat
he
was
floored
when
they
turned
up
three
slightly
elderly
toshiba
laptops
each
of
which
booted
into
a
crufty
old
flavor
of
windows
and
only
one
of
which
had
any
obvious
material
defects
a
starred
corner
in
its
lcd
he
was
delighted
by
the
dumpsters
full
of
plush
toys
by
the
lightly
used
office
furniture
by
the
technical
books
and
the
cds
of
last
software
the
smells
were
largely
inoffensive
kurt
mentioned
that
the
picking
was
better
in
winter
when
the
outdoors
was
one
big
fridge
but
alan
could
hardly
smell
anything
except
the
sour
smell
of
an
old
dumpster
and
occasionally
a
whiff
of
coffee
grounds
they
took
a
break
at
the
vietnamese
place
for
coconut
ice
and
glasses
of
sweet
iced
coffee
and
kurt
nodded
at
the
cops
in
the
restaurant
alan
wondered
why
kurt
was
so
pleasant
with
these
cops
out
in
the
boonies
but
so
hostile
to
the
law
in
kensington
market
how
are
we
going
to
get
connectivity
out
of
the
market
kurt
said
i
mean
all
this
work
and
we
hardly
gotten
four
or
five
square
blocks
covered
buck
up
alan
said
we
could
spend
another
two
years
just
helping
people
in
the
market
use
what
we
installed
and
it
would
still
be
productive
kurt
mouth
opened
and
alan
held
his
hand
up
not
that
i
proposing
that
we
do
that
i
just
mean
there
plenty
of
good
been
done
so
far
what
we
need
is
some
publicity
for
it
some
critical
mass
and
some
way
that
we
can
get
ordinary
people
involved
we
fit
a
critical
mass
into
your
front
room
and
put
them
to
work
so
what
do
we
get
them
to
do
it
a
good
question
there
something
i
saw
online
the
other
day
i
wanted
to
show
you
why
do
we
go
home
and
get
connected
there
still
plenty
of
good
diving
out
there
no
need
to
go
home
anyway
i
know
a
place
they
drove
off
into
a
maze
of
and
cheaply
built
gaudy
monster
homes
with
triple
garages
and
sagging
rain
gutters
the
streets
had
no
sidewalks
and
the
inevitable
basketball
nets
over
every
garage
showed
no
signs
of
use
kurt
pulled
them
up
in
front
of
a
house
that
was
indistinguishable
from
the
others
and
took
the
laptop
from
under
the
buick
seat
plugging
it
into
the
cigarette
lighter
and
flipping
its
lid
there
an
open
network
here
kurt
said
as
he
plugged
in
the
wireless
card
he
pointed
at
the
dormer
windows
in
the
top
room
how
the
hell
did
you
find
that
alan
said
looking
at
the
darkened
window
there
was
a
gate
at
the
side
of
the
house
and
in
the
back
an
aboveground
pool
kurt
laughed
these
consultants
he
made
little
quotes
with
his
fingers
wardrove
toronto
they
went
from
one
end
of
the
city
to
the
other
with
a
gps
and
a
wireless
card
and
logged
all
the
open
access
points
they
found
then
released
a
report
claiming
that
all
of
those
access
points
represented
ignorant
consumers
who
were
leaving
themselves
vulnerable
to
attacks
and
making
internet
connections
available
to
terrorists
one
of
the
access
points
they
identified
was
for
chrissakes
and
mine
was
open
because
i
a
crazy
fucking
anarchist
not
because
an
ignorant
who
does
know
any
better
and
that
got
me
to
thinking
that
there
were
probably
lots
of
people
like
me
around
running
open
aps
so
one
night
i
was
out
here
diving
and
i
was
trying
to
remember
who
played
the
sundance
kid
in
butch
cassidy
and
i
knew
that
if
i
only
had
a
net
connection
i
could
google
it
i
had
a
stumbler
an
app
that
logged
all
the
open
wifi
access
points
that
i
came
into
range
of
and
a
gps
attachment
that
i
dived
that
could
interface
with
the
software
that
mapped
the
aps
on
a
map
of
toronto
so
i
could
just
belt
the
machine
in
there
on
the
passenger
seat
and
go
driving
around
until
i
had
a
list
of
all
the
wireless
internet
that
i
could
see
from
the
street
so
i
got
kind
of
bored
and
went
back
to
diving
and
then
i
did
what
i
usually
do
at
the
end
of
the
night
i
went
driving
around
some
residential
streets
just
to
see
evidence
of
humanity
after
a
night
in
the
garbage
and
also
because
the
people
out
here
sometimes
put
out
nice
sofas
and
things
when
i
got
home
i
looked
at
my
map
and
there
were
tons
of
access
points
out
by
the
industrial
buildings
and
some
on
the
commercial
strips
and
a
few
out
here
in
the
residential
areas
but
the
one
with
the
best
signal
was
right
here
and
when
i
clicked
on
it
i
saw
that
the
name
of
the
network
was
alan
said
huh
because
parasitenet
was
kurt
name
for
his
wireless
project
though
they
had
used
it
much
since
alan
got
involved
and
they
gotten
halfway
legit
but
still
yeah
kurt
said
that
what
i
said
huh
so
i
googled
parasitenet
to
see
what
i
could
find
and
i
found
an
old
message
i
posted
to
when
i
was
getting
started
out
a
kind
of
manifesto
about
what
i
planned
to
do
and
google
had
snarfed
it
up
and
this
guy
whoever
he
is
must
have
read
it
and
decided
to
name
his
network
after
it
so
i
figger
this
guy
to
share
packets
with
me
for
sure
and
so
i
always
hunt
down
this
ap
when
i
want
to
get
online
you
never
met
him
huh
never
i
always
out
here
at
two
or
so
and
there
never
a
light
on
keep
meaning
to
come
back
around
five
some
afternoon
and
ring
the
bell
and
say
hello
never
got
to
it
alan
pursed
his
lips
and
watched
kurt
prod
at
the
keyboard
he
got
a
shitkicking
net
connection
though
tell
you
what
feels
like
a
and
the
ip
address
comes
off
of
an
isp
in
waterloo
you
need
a
browser
right
alan
shook
his
head
you
know
i
ca
even
remember
what
it
was
i
wanted
to
show
you
there
some
kind
of
idea
kicking
at
me
now
though
kurt
shifted
his
laptop
to
the
back
seat
mindful
of
the
cords
and
the
antenna
what
up
let
do
some
more
driving
around
let
it
perk
okay
you
got
more
dumpsters
you
want
to
show
me
brother
i
got
dumpsters
for
weeks
months
years
it
was
the
wardriving
of
course
alan
called
out
the
names
of
the
networks
that
they
passed
as
they
passed
them
watching
the
flags
pop
up
on
the
map
of
toronto
they
drove
the
streets
all
night
watched
the
sun
go
up
and
the
flags
multiplied
on
the
network
alan
did
even
have
to
explain
it
to
kurt
who
got
it
immediately
they
were
close
now
thinking
together
in
the
feverish
on
the
streets
here
the
thing
kurt
said
as
they
drank
their
coffees
at
the
vesta
lunch
a
grimy
diner
that
alan
only
seemed
to
visit
during
the
smallest
hours
of
the
morning
i
started
off
thinking
well
the
cell
companies
are
screwed
up
because
they
think
that
they
need
to
hose
the
whole
city
from
their
high
towers
with
their
powerful
transmitters
and
my
little
boxes
will
be
and
smarter
and
more
realistic
and
grassroots
and
democratic
right
alan
said
i
was
just
thinking
of
that
what
could
be
more
democratic
than
just
encouraging
people
to
use
their
own
access
points
and
their
own
internet
connections
to
bootstrap
the
city
yeah
kurt
said
sure
you
wo
get
to
realize
your
dream
of
getting
a
free
internet
by
bridging
down
at
the
big
cage
at
front
street
but
we
can
still
play
around
with
hardware
and
convincing
the
people
who
know
why
wifi
is
cool
to
join
up
has
got
to
be
easier
than
convincing
shopkeepers
who
never
heard
of
wireless
to
let
us
put
antennae
and
boxes
on
their
walls
right
kurt
said
getting
more
excited
right
i
mean
it
just
ego
right
why
do
we
need
to
the
network
he
spun
around
on
his
cracked
stool
and
the
waitress
gave
him
a
dirty
look
gim
me
some
apple
pie
please
he
said
this
is
the
best
part
it
going
to
violate
the
hell
out
of
everyone
contracts
with
their
isps
they
sell
you
an
internet
connection
and
then
tell
you
that
they
cut
off
your
service
if
you
too
hungry
well
fuck
that
it
not
just
community
networking
it
be
civil
disobedience
against
shitty
terms
of
service
there
were
a
couple
early
morning
in
the
diner
who
looked
up
from
their
yolky
eggs
to
glare
at
him
kurt
spotted
them
and
waved
sorry
boys
ever
get
one
of
those
ideas
that
so
good
you
ca
help
but
do
a
little
dance
one
of
the
smiled
yeah
but
his
wife
always
turns
me
down
he
socked
the
other
in
the
shoulder
the
other
grunted
into
his
coffee
nice
very
nice
gon
na
be
a
of
fun
today
i
can
tell
they
left
the
diner
in
a
sleepdep
haze
and
squinted
into
the
sunrise
and
grinned
at
each
other
and
burped
up
eggs
and
sausages
and
bacon
and
coffee
and
headed
toward
kurt
buick
hang
on
alan
said
let
have
a
walk
okay
the
city
smelled
like
morning
dew
and
grass
and
and
baking
bread
and
a
whiff
of
the
distant
cadbury
factory
oozing
chocolate
miasma
over
the
hills
and
the
streetcar
tracks
around
them
millions
were
stirring
in
their
beds
clattering
in
their
kitchens
passing
water
and
taking
on
vitamins
it
invigorated
him
made
him
feel
part
of
something
huge
and
like
being
in
his
father
the
mountain
up
there
kurt
said
pointing
to
a
little
playground
atop
the
hill
that
rose
sharply
up
dupont
toward
christie
where
a
herd
of
plastic
rocking
horses
swayed
creakily
in
the
breeze
up
there
alan
agreed
and
they
set
off
kicking
droplets
of
dew
off
the
grass
beside
the
sidewalk
the
sunrise
was
a
thousand
times
more
striking
from
atop
the
climber
filtered
through
the
new
shoots
on
the
tree
branches
kurt
lit
a
cigarette
and
blew
plumes
into
the
shafting
light
and
they
admired
the
effect
of
the
wind
whipping
it
away
i
think
this
will
work
alan
said
we
do
something
splashy
for
the
press
get
a
lot
of
people
to
change
the
names
of
their
networks
more
people
will
use
the
networks
more
will
create
them
it
a
good
plan
kurt
nodded
yeah
we
smart
guys
something
smashed
into
alan
head
and
bounced
to
the
dirt
below
the
climber
a
small
sharp
rock
alan
reeled
and
tumbled
from
the
climber
stunned
barely
managing
to
twist
to
his
side
before
landing
the
air
whooshed
out
of
his
lungs
and
tears
sprang
into
his
eyes
gingerly
he
touched
his
head
his
fingers
came
away
wet
kurt
was
shouting
something
but
he
could
hear
it
something
moved
in
the
bushes
moved
into
his
line
of
sight
moved
deliberately
into
his
line
of
sight
danny
he
had
another
rock
in
his
hand
and
he
wound
up
and
pitched
it
it
hit
alan
in
the
forehead
and
his
head
snapped
back
and
he
grunted
kurt
feet
landed
in
the
dirt
a
few
inches
from
his
eyes
big
boots
with
chains
davey
flitted
out
of
the
bushes
and
onto
the
plastic
jumping
from
the
horse
to
the
duck
to
the
chicken
leaving
the
big
springs
beneath
them
to
rock
and
creak
kurt
took
two
steps
toward
him
but
davey
was
away
under
the
chain
link
fence
and
over
the
edge
of
the
hill
leading
down
to
dupont
street
you
okay
kurt
said
crouching
down
beside
him
putting
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
need
a
doctor
no
doctors
alan
said
no
doctors
i
be
okay
they
inched
their
way
back
to
the
car
the
world
spinning
around
them
the
met
them
on
the
way
out
of
the
vesta
lunch
and
their
eyes
went
to
alan
bloodied
face
they
looked
away
alan
felt
his
kinship
with
the
woken
world
around
him
slip
away
and
knew
he
never
be
truly
a
part
of
it
he
would
let
kurt
walk
him
up
the
steps
and
put
him
to
bed
so
instead
kurt
watched
from
the
curb
until
alan
went
inside
then
gunned
the
engine
and
pulled
away
it
was
still
morning
rush
hour
and
the
were
clacking
toward
work
on
hard
leather
shoes
or
piling
their
offspring
into
minivans
alan
washed
the
blood
off
his
scalp
and
face
and
took
a
gingerly
shower
when
he
turned
off
the
water
he
heard
muffled
sounds
coming
through
the
open
windows
a
wailing
electric
guitar
he
went
to
the
window
and
stuck
his
head
out
and
saw
krishna
sitting
on
an
unmade
bed
in
the
unsoundproofed
bedroom
in
a
grimy
housecoat
guitar
on
his
lap
eyes
closed
concentrating
on
the
screams
he
was
wringing
from
the
instrument
long
neck
alan
wanted
to
sleep
but
the
noise
and
the
throb
of
his
head
going
in
counterpoint
and
the
sight
of
davey
flicking
from
climber
to
bush
to
hillside
scuttling
so
quickly
alan
was
scarce
sure
he
seen
him
it
all
conspired
to
keep
him
awake
he
bought
coffees
at
the
donut
time
on
college
the
greek
be
open
for
hours
and
brought
it
over
to
kurt
storefront
but
the
lights
were
out
so
he
wandered
slowly
home
sucking
back
the
coffee
benny
had
another
seizure
halfway
up
the
mountain
stiffening
up
and
falling
down
before
they
could
catch
him
as
billy
lay
supine
in
the
dirt
alan
heard
a
distant
howl
not
like
a
wolf
but
like
a
thing
that
a
wolf
had
caught
and
is
savaging
with
its
jaws
the
sound
made
his
neck
prickle
and
when
he
looked
at
the
little
ones
he
saw
that
their
eyes
were
rolling
crazily
got
to
get
him
home
alan
said
lifting
benny
up
with
a
grunt
the
little
ones
tried
to
help
but
they
just
got
tangled
up
in
benny
long
loose
limbs
and
so
alan
shooed
them
off
telling
them
to
keep
a
lookout
behind
him
look
for
davey
lurking
on
an
outcropping
or
in
a
branch
rock
held
at
the
ready
when
they
came
to
the
cave
mouth
again
he
heard
another
one
of
the
screams
brendan
stirred
over
his
shoulders
and
alan
set
him
down
heart
thundering
looking
every
way
for
davey
who
had
come
back
he
gone
away
for
the
night
burt
said
conversationally
he
sat
up
and
then
gingerly
got
to
his
feet
he
be
back
in
the
morning
though
the
cave
was
destroyed
alan
books
toys
were
smashed
their
clothes
were
bubbling
in
the
hot
spring
in
rags
and
tatters
brian
carvings
were
broken
and
smashed
schoolbooks
were
ruined
you
all
right
alan
said
brian
dusted
himself
off
and
stretched
his
arms
and
legs
out
i
be
fine
he
said
it
not
me
he
after
alan
stared
blankly
as
the
brothers
tidied
up
the
cave
and
made
piles
of
their
belongings
the
little
ones
looked
scared
without
any
of
the
hardness
he
remembered
from
that
day
when
they
fought
it
out
on
the
hillside
benny
retreated
to
his
perch
but
before
the
sun
set
and
the
cave
darkened
he
brought
a
couple
blankets
down
and
dropped
them
beside
the
nook
where
alan
slept
he
had
his
baseball
bat
with
him
and
it
made
a
good
solid
aluminum
sound
when
he
leaned
it
against
the
wall
silently
the
small
ones
crossed
the
cave
with
a
pile
of
their
own
blankets
george
bringing
up
the
rear
with
a
torn
stuffed
with
sharp
stones
alan
looked
at
them
and
listened
to
the
mountain
breathe
around
them
it
had
been
years
since
his
father
had
had
anything
to
say
to
them
it
had
been
years
since
their
mother
had
done
anything
except
wash
the
clothes
was
there
a
voice
in
the
cave
now
a
wind
a
smell
he
could
smell
anything
he
could
hear
anything
benny
propped
himself
up
against
the
cave
wall
with
a
blanket
around
his
shoulders
and
the
baseball
bat
held
loose
and
ready
between
his
knees
a
smell
then
on
the
wind
sewage
and
sulfur
a
stink
of
fear
alan
looked
to
his
brothers
then
he
got
up
and
left
the
cave
without
a
look
back
he
was
going
to
wait
for
davey
to
come
to
him
the
night
had
come
up
warm
and
the
highway
sounds
down
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
mingled
with
the
spring
breeze
in
the
new
buds
on
the
trees
and
the
new
needles
on
the
pines
the
small
sounds
of
birds
and
bugs
foraging
in
the
new
year
alan
slipped
out
the
cave
mouth
and
looked
around
into
the
twilight
hoping
for
a
glimpse
of
something
out
of
the
ordinary
but
apart
from
an
early
owl
and
a
handful
of
fireflies
sparking
off
like
distant
stars
he
saw
nothing
amiss
he
padded
around
the
mountainside
stooped
down
low
stopping
every
few
steps
to
listen
for
footfalls
at
the
high
small
entrance
to
the
golems
cave
he
paused
lay
on
his
belly
and
slowly
peered
around
the
fissure
it
had
been
years
since
alvin
had
come
up
to
the
golems
cave
years
since
one
had
appeared
in
their
father
cave
they
had
long
ago
ceased
bringing
their
kills
to
the
threshold
of
the
boys
cave
ceased
leaving
pelts
in
neat
piles
on
the
eve
of
the
waning
moon
the
view
from
the
outcropping
was
stunning
the
village
had
grown
to
a
town
fast
on
its
way
to
being
a
city
a
million
lights
twinkled
the
highway
cut
a
glistening
ribbon
of
streetlamps
through
the
night
a
straight
line
slicing
the
hills
and
curves
there
were
thousands
of
people
down
there
all
connected
by
a
humming
a
work
of
nets
cunning
knots
tied
in
a
cunning
grid
of
wire
and
radio
and
civilization
slowly
he
looked
back
into
the
golems
cave
he
remembered
it
as
being
lined
with
ranks
of
bones
a
barbarian
cathedral
whose
arches
were
decorated
with
ranked
skulls
and
interlocked
tiny
animal
tibia
now
those
bones
were
scattered
and
broken
the
ossified
wainscoting
rendered
by
missing
and
tumbled
bones
alan
wondered
how
the
golems
had
reacted
when
darl
had
ruined
their
centuries
of
careful
work
then
looking
more
closely
he
realized
that
the
bones
were
dusty
and
grimed
cobwebbed
and
moldering
they
been
lying
around
for
a
lot
longer
than
a
couple
hours
alan
crept
into
the
cave
now
eyes
open
ears
straining
puffs
of
dust
rose
with
his
footfalls
illuminated
in
the
moonlight
and
city
light
streaming
in
from
the
cave
mouth
another
set
of
feet
had
crossed
this
floor
small
boyish
feet
that
took
slow
arthritic
steps
they
come
in
circled
the
cave
and
gone
out
again
alan
listened
for
the
golems
and
heard
nothing
he
did
his
own
slow
circle
of
the
cave
peering
into
the
shadows
where
had
they
gone
there
a
streak
of
red
clay
leading
to
a
mound
alan
drew
up
alongside
of
it
and
made
out
the
runny
outlines
of
the
legs
and
arms
the
torso
and
the
head
the
golem
had
dragged
itself
into
this
corner
and
had
fallen
to
mud
the
dust
on
the
floor
was
red
dried
mud
how
long
since
he
been
in
this
cave
how
long
since
he
come
around
this
side
of
the
mountain
two
months
three
four
longer
how
long
had
the
golems
lain
dead
and
dust
in
this
cave
they
carved
his
cradle
fed
him
taught
him
to
talk
and
to
walk
in
some
sense
they
were
his
fathers
as
much
as
the
mountain
was
he
fished
around
inside
himself
for
emotion
and
found
none
relief
maybe
relief
the
golems
were
an
embodiment
of
his
strangeness
as
weird
as
his
smooth
navelless
belly
an
element
of
his
secret
waiting
to
surface
and
what
what
had
he
been
afraid
of
contempt
vivisection
he
know
anymore
but
knew
that
he
wanted
to
fit
in
and
that
the
absence
made
that
more
possible
there
was
a
smell
on
the
wind
in
here
the
death
and
corruption
smell
he
noticed
in
the
sleeping
cave
father
was
worried
no
davey
was
inside
that
was
his
smell
the
smell
of
davey
long
dead
and
back
from
the
grave
alan
walked
deeper
into
the
tunnels
following
his
nose
davey
dropped
down
onto
his
shoulders
from
a
ledge
in
an
opening
where
the
ceiling
stretched
far
over
their
heads
he
was
so
light
at
first
alan
thought
someone
had
thrown
a
blanket
over
his
shoulders
then
the
fingers
dug
into
his
eyes
then
the
fingers
fishhooked
the
corner
of
his
mouth
then
the
screech
thick
as
a
desiccated
tongue
dry
as
the
dust
of
a
golem
like
no
sound
and
like
all
the
sounds
at
once
the
smell
of
corruption
was
everywhere
filling
his
nostrils
like
his
face
has
been
ground
into
a
pile
of
rotten
meat
he
tugged
at
the
dry
thin
hands
tangled
in
his
face
and
found
them
strong
as
iron
bands
and
then
he
screamed
then
they
were
both
screeching
and
rolling
on
the
ground
and
he
had
danny
thumb
in
his
hand
bending
it
back
painfully
until
it
came
off
clean
with
a
sound
like
dry
wood
cracking
doug
was
off
him
then
crawling
off
toward
the
shadows
alan
got
to
his
knees
still
holding
the
thumb
and
made
ready
to
charge
him
holding
his
sore
face
with
one
hand
when
he
heard
the
slap
of
running
footfalls
behind
him
and
then
bill
was
streaking
past
him
baseball
bat
at
ready
and
he
swung
it
like
a
and
connected
with
a
hollow
crunch
of
aluminum
on
chitinous
leathery
skin
the
sound
shocked
alan
to
his
feet
wet
sick
rising
in
his
gorge
benny
was
winding
up
for
a
second
blow
aiming
for
darren
head
this
time
an
park
that
would
have
knocked
that
shrunken
head
off
the
skinny
blackened
neck
and
alan
shouted
no
and
roared
at
benny
and
leapt
for
him
as
he
sailed
through
the
air
he
thought
he
was
saving
from
the
feeling
he
carried
with
him
for
a
decade
but
as
he
connected
with
benny
he
felt
a
feeling
clean
and
hard
and
he
knew
he
was
defending
saving
him
for
once
instead
of
hurting
him
he
was
still
holding
on
to
the
thumb
and
davey
was
inches
from
his
face
and
he
was
atop
benny
and
they
breathed
together
chests
heaving
alan
wobbled
slowly
to
his
feet
and
dropped
the
thumb
onto
drew
chest
then
he
helped
billy
to
his
feet
and
they
limped
off
to
their
beds
behind
them
they
heard
the
dry
sounds
of
davey
getting
to
his
feet
coughing
and
hacking
with
a
crunch
of
thin
cracked
ribs
he
was
sitting
on
their
mother
the
next
morning
he
was
naked
and
unsexed
by
desiccation
all
the
brothers
even
little
george
had
ceased
going
about
in
the
nude
when
they
passed
through
puberty
sullen
and
silent
atop
the
white
chipped
finish
of
her
enamel
top
so
worn
and
ground
down
that
it
resembled
a
collection
of
it
had
been
a
long
time
since
any
of
them
had
sought
solace
in
their
mother
gentle
rocking
since
indeed
they
had
spared
her
a
thought
beyond
filling
her
belly
with
clothes
and
emptying
her
out
an
hour
later
the
little
ones
woke
first
and
saw
him
taking
cover
behind
a
stalagmite
peering
around
each
holding
a
sharp
flat
rock
each
with
his
pockets
full
of
more
danny
looked
at
each
in
turn
with
eyes
gone
yellow
and
congealed
and
bared
his
mouthful
of
broken
and
blackened
teeth
in
a
rictus
that
was
equal
parts
humor
and
threat
bradley
was
the
next
to
wake
his
bat
in
his
hand
and
his
eyelids
fluttering
open
as
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
then
alan
was
up
as
well
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
he
crouched
down
and
walked
slowly
to
davey
he
had
the
knife
handle
wound
with
cord
edge
gone
back
to
rust
and
still
reddened
with
blood
but
its
sharpness
mattered
less
than
its
history
welcome
me
home
davey
rasped
as
alan
drew
closer
welcome
me
home
welcome
me
home
you
welcome
in
this
home
alan
said
but
davey
was
welcome
just
last
week
alan
had
seen
a
bedroom
set
that
he
suspected
he
could
afford
the
golems
had
left
him
a
goodly
supply
of
gold
flake
though
with
the
golems
gone
he
supposed
that
the
sacks
were
the
end
of
the
family
fortune
but
with
the
bedroom
set
would
come
a
kitchen
table
and
then
a
bookcase
and
a
cooker
and
a
fridge
and
when
they
were
ready
he
could
send
each
brother
on
his
way
with
the
skills
and
socialization
necessary
to
survive
in
the
wide
world
to
find
women
and
love
and
raise
families
of
their
own
then
he
could
go
and
find
himself
a
skinny
redheaded
girl
with
a
scots
accent
and
in
due
time
her
belly
would
swell
up
and
there
would
be
a
child
it
was
all
planned
out
practically
preordained
but
now
here
they
were
with
the
embodied
shame
sitting
on
their
mother
his
torn
thumb
gleaming
with
the
wire
he
used
to
attach
it
back
to
his
hand
that
very
generous
danny
said
you
a
prince
among
let
go
alan
said
breakfast
in
town
i
buying
they
filed
out
and
alan
spared
davey
a
look
over
his
shoulder
as
they
slipped
away
head
down
on
his
knees
rocking
in
time
with
their
mother
krishna
grinned
at
him
from
the
front
porch
as
he
staggered
home
from
kurt
storefront
he
was
dressed
in
a
hoodie
and
huge
outsized
raver
pants
that
dangled
with
straps
and
reflectors
meant
to
add
kinetic
reflections
on
the
dance
floor
hello
neighbor
he
said
as
alan
came
up
the
walkway
good
evening
alan
stopped
and
put
his
hands
on
his
hips
straightened
his
head
out
on
his
neck
so
that
he
was
standing
tall
i
understand
what
he
gets
out
of
alan
said
i
understand
that
perfectly
well
who
could
use
a
little
servant
and
errand
boy
but
what
i
do
understand
what
i
ca
understand
what
i
like
to
understand
is
what
can
you
get
out
of
the
arrangement
krishna
shrugged
elaborately
i
have
no
idea
what
you
talking
about
we
had
gold
in
the
old
days
is
that
what
bought
you
maybe
you
should
ask
me
for
a
counteroffer
i
not
poor
i
never
take
a
penny
that
offered
voluntarily
krishna
lit
a
nonchalant
cig
and
flicked
the
match
toward
his
dry
xeroscaped
lawn
there
were
little
burnt
patches
among
the
wild
grasses
there
from
other
thrown
matches
and
that
was
one
solved
then
it
you
think
i
a
monster
alan
said
krishna
nodded
yup
not
a
scary
monster
but
a
monster
still
alan
nodded
probably
he
said
probably
i
am
not
a
human
maybe
not
a
person
not
a
real
person
but
if
i
bad
he
a
thousand
times
worse
you
know
he
a
scary
monster
krishna
dragged
at
his
cigarette
you
know
a
lot
of
monsters
do
you
alan
said
he
jerked
his
head
toward
the
house
you
share
a
bed
with
one
krishna
narrowed
his
eyes
she
not
scary
either
you
cut
off
her
wings
but
it
does
make
her
any
less
monstrous
one
thing
i
can
tell
you
you
pretty
special
most
real
people
never
see
us
you
saw
me
right
off
it
like
where
most
of
the
humans
could
tell
that
there
was
a
vampire
in
their
midst
van
helsing
could
tell
krishna
said
he
hunted
dracula
you
hunt
what
you
ca
see
he
said
so
your
kind
has
been
getting
a
safe
free
ride
for
centuries
living
off
of
us
passing
among
us
passing
for
us
van
helsing
got
killed
alan
said
did
he
and
besides
that
there
was
someone
else
who
could
see
the
vampires
renfield
the
pathetic
pet
and
errand
boy
remember
renfield
in
his
cage
in
the
asylum
eating
flies
trying
to
be
a
monster
von
helsing
recognized
the
monster
but
so
did
renfield
i
no
one
renfield
krishna
said
and
spat
onto
alan
lawn
first
fire
then
water
he
was
leaving
his
mark
on
alan
land
that
was
certain
you
no
van
helsing
either
alan
said
what
the
difference
between
you
and
a
racist
krishna
you
call
me
a
monster
why
i
call
you
a
paki
he
stiffened
at
the
slur
and
so
did
alan
he
never
used
the
word
before
but
it
had
sprung
readily
from
his
lips
as
though
it
had
lurked
there
all
along
waiting
to
be
uttered
racists
say
that
there
such
a
thing
as
within
the
human
race
that
blacks
and
whites
and
chinese
and
indians
are
all
members
of
different
krishna
said
which
is
bullshit
on
the
other
hand
you
he
broke
off
left
the
thought
to
hang
he
did
need
to
finish
it
alan
hand
went
to
his
smooth
belly
the
spot
where
real
people
had
navels
old
scarred
remnants
of
their
connections
to
real
human
mothers
so
you
hate
monsters
krishna
all
except
for
the
ones
you
sleep
with
and
the
ones
you
work
for
i
do
work
for
anyone
he
said
except
me
alan
said
i
going
to
pour
myself
a
glass
of
wine
would
you
like
one
krishna
grinned
hard
and
mirthless
sure
neighbor
that
sounds
lovely
alan
went
inside
and
took
out
two
glasses
got
a
bottle
of
something
cheap
and
serviceable
from
niagara
wine
country
out
of
the
fridge
worked
the
corkscrew
all
on
automatic
his
hands
shook
a
little
so
he
held
them
under
the
cold
tap
stuck
to
the
wall
over
his
work
surface
was
a
magnetic
bar
and
stuck
to
it
was
a
set
of
very
sharp
knives
that
were
each
forged
from
a
single
piece
of
steel
he
reached
for
one
and
felt
its
comfort
in
his
hand
seductive
and
glinting
it
was
approximately
the
same
size
as
the
one
he
used
on
davey
a
knife
that
he
held
again
and
again
reached
for
in
the
night
and
carried
to
breakfast
for
months
he
was
once
robbed
at
knifepoint
taking
the
deposit
to
the
bank
after
christmas
rush
thousands
of
dollars
in
cash
in
a
brown
paper
sack
in
his
bag
and
the
mugger
a
man
in
a
good
suit
knew
exactly
what
he
was
carrying
and
where
must
have
been
casing
him
for
days
the
man
had
had
a
knife
about
this
size
and
when
alan
had
seen
it
pointed
at
him
it
had
been
like
an
old
friend
one
whose
orbit
had
escaped
his
gravity
years
before
so
long
ago
that
he
forgotten
about
their
tender
camaraderie
it
was
all
he
could
do
not
to
reach
out
and
take
the
knife
from
the
man
say
hello
again
and
renew
the
friendship
he
moved
the
knife
back
to
the
magnet
bar
and
let
the
field
tug
it
out
of
his
fingers
and
it
back
to
the
wall
picked
up
the
wine
glasses
and
stepped
back
out
onto
the
porch
krishna
appeared
not
to
have
stirred
except
to
light
a
fresh
cigarette
you
spit
in
mine
krishna
said
though
their
porches
adjoined
alan
walked
down
his
steps
and
crossed
over
the
lawn
next
door
held
the
glass
out
to
krishna
he
took
it
and
their
hands
brushed
each
other
the
way
his
hand
had
brushed
the
man
hand
when
he
handed
over
the
sack
of
money
the
touch
connected
him
to
something
human
in
a
way
that
made
him
ashamed
of
his
desperation
i
do
normally
drink
before
noon
adam
said
i
do
much
care
when
i
drink
krishna
said
and
took
a
slug
sounds
like
a
dangerous
philosophy
for
a
bartender
adam
said
why
plenty
of
drunk
bartenders
it
not
a
hard
job
krishna
spat
big
club
all
you
doing
is
uncapping
beers
and
mixing
shooters
all
night
i
could
do
it
in
my
sleep
you
should
quit
alan
said
you
should
get
a
better
job
no
one
should
do
a
job
he
can
do
in
his
sleep
krishna
put
a
hand
out
on
alan
chest
the
warmth
of
his
fingertips
radiating
through
alan
windbreaker
do
try
to
arrange
me
on
your
chessboard
monster
maybe
you
can
move
natalie
around
and
maybe
you
can
move
around
a
bunch
of
kensington
and
maybe
you
can
budge
my
idiot
girlfriend
a
couple
of
squares
but
i
not
on
the
board
i
got
my
job
and
if
i
leave
it
it
be
for
me
alan
retreated
to
his
porch
and
sipped
his
own
wine
his
mouth
tasted
like
it
was
full
of
blood
still
a
taste
that
was
woken
up
by
the
wine
he
set
the
glass
down
i
not
playing
chess
with
you
he
said
i
do
play
games
i
try
to
help
i
help
krishna
swigged
the
glass
empty
you
wan
na
know
what
makes
you
a
monster
alvin
that
attitude
right
there
you
do
understand
a
single
fucking
thing
about
real
people
but
you
spend
all
your
time
rearranging
them
on
your
board
and
you
tell
them
and
you
tell
yourself
that
helping
you
know
how
you
could
help
man
you
could
crawl
back
under
your
rock
and
leave
the
people
world
for
people
something
snapped
in
alan
canada
for
canadians
right
send
back
where
they
came
from
right
he
stalked
to
the
railing
that
divided
their
porches
the
taste
of
blood
stung
his
mouth
krishna
met
him
moving
swiftly
to
the
railing
as
well
hood
thrown
back
eyes
hard
and
glittering
and
stoned
you
think
you
can
make
me
feel
like
a
racist
make
me
his
voice
squeaked
on
the
last
syllable
man
the
only
day
i
would
piss
on
you
is
if
you
were
on
fire
you
fucking
freak
some
part
of
alan
knew
that
this
person
was
laughable
a
renfield
eating
bugs
but
that
voice
of
reason
was
too
quiet
to
be
heard
over
the
animal
screech
that
was
trying
to
work
its
way
free
of
his
throat
he
could
smell
krishna
cigarettes
and
booze
and
club
and
sweat
see
the
gold
flecks
in
his
dark
irises
the
red
limning
of
his
eyelids
krishna
raised
a
hand
as
if
to
slap
him
smirked
when
he
flinched
back
then
he
grabbed
krishna
wrist
and
pulled
hard
yanking
the
boy
off
his
feet
slamming
his
chest
into
the
railing
hard
enough
to
shower
dried
spider
nests
and
flakes
of
paint
to
the
porch
floor
i
every
bit
the
monster
my
brother
is
he
hissed
in
ear
i
him
the
monster
he
is
he
said
punching
krishna
hard
in
the
ear
with
his
free
hand
listen
you
can
stay
away
from
me
and
you
can
stay
away
from
my
family
or
you
can
enter
a
world
of
terrible
hurt
it
up
to
you
nod
if
you
understand
krishna
was
still
except
for
a
tremble
the
moment
stretched
and
alan
broke
it
by
cracking
him
across
the
ear
again
nod
if
you
understand
goddammit
he
said
his
vision
going
fuzzily
black
at
the
edges
krishna
was
silent
still
coiled
any
minute
now
he
would
struggle
free
and
they
be
in
a
clinch
he
remembered
kneeling
on
davey
chest
holding
the
rock
over
him
and
realizing
that
he
did
know
what
to
do
next
taking
davey
to
their
father
only
davey
had
struck
him
first
he
only
been
restraining
him
defending
himself
alan
had
hit
krishna
first
nod
if
you
understand
krishna
he
said
and
heard
a
note
of
pleading
in
his
voice
krishna
held
still
alan
felt
like
an
idiot
standing
there
his
neighbor
laid
out
across
the
railing
that
divided
their
porches
the
first
cars
of
the
day
driving
past
and
the
first
smells
of
bread
and
fish
and
hospital
and
pizza
blending
together
there
in
the
heart
of
the
market
he
let
go
and
krishna
straightened
up
his
eyes
downcast
for
a
second
alan
harbored
a
germ
of
hope
that
he
bested
krishna
and
so
scared
him
into
leaving
him
alone
then
krishna
looked
up
and
met
his
eye
his
face
was
blank
his
eyes
like
brown
marbles
heavy
lidded
considering
not
stoned
at
all
anymore
sizing
alan
up
calculating
the
debt
he
just
amassed
what
it
would
take
to
pay
it
off
he
picked
up
alan
wine
glass
and
alan
saw
that
it
was
one
of
the
cheapies
he
bought
a
couple
dozen
of
for
an
art
show
once
but
rather
irish
crystal
that
he
found
at
a
flea
market
in
hamilton
a
complete
fluke
and
one
of
his
miracle
thrift
scores
krishna
turned
the
glass
one
way
and
another
in
his
hand
letting
it
catch
the
sunrise
bend
the
light
around
the
smudgy
fingerprints
he
set
it
down
then
on
the
railing
balancing
it
carefully
he
took
one
step
back
then
a
second
so
that
he
was
almost
at
the
door
they
stared
at
each
other
and
then
he
took
one
two
running
steps
like
a
soccer
player
winding
up
for
a
penalty
kick
and
then
he
unwound
leg
flying
straight
up
tip
of
his
toe
catching
the
wine
glass
so
that
it
hurtled
straight
for
alan
forehead
moving
like
a
bullet
alan
flinched
and
the
glass
hit
the
brick
wall
behind
him
disintegrating
into
a
mist
of
glass
fragments
that
rained
down
on
his
hair
down
his
collar
across
the
side
of
his
face
in
his
ear
krishna
ticked
a
salute
off
his
forehead
wheeled
and
went
back
into
his
house
the
taste
of
blood
was
in
alan
mouth
more
blood
coursed
down
his
neck
from
a
nick
in
his
ear
and
all
around
him
on
the
porch
the
glitter
of
crystal
he
went
inside
to
get
a
broom
but
before
he
could
clean
up
he
sat
down
for
a
moment
on
the
sofa
to
catch
his
breath
he
fell
instantly
asleep
on
the
creaking
horsehide
and
when
he
woke
again
it
was
dark
and
raining
and
someone
else
had
cleaned
up
his
porch
the
mountain
path
had
grown
over
with
weeds
and
thistles
and
condoms
and
cans
and
inexplicable
and
doll
parts
she
clung
to
his
hand
as
he
pushed
through
it
stepping
in
brackish
puddles
and
tripping
in
sink
holes
he
navigated
the
trail
like
a
mountain
goat
while
mimi
lagged
behind
tugging
his
arm
every
time
she
misstepped
jerking
it
painfully
in
its
socket
he
turned
to
her
ready
to
snap
the
fuck
up
would
you
and
then
swallowed
the
words
her
eyes
were
and
scared
her
full
lips
drawn
down
into
a
clown
frown
bracketed
by
deep
lines
won
by
other
moments
of
sorrow
he
helped
her
beside
him
and
turned
his
back
on
the
mountain
faced
the
road
and
the
town
and
the
car
with
its
trunk
with
its
corpse
with
his
brother
and
he
put
an
arm
around
her
shoulders
a
brotherly
arm
and
hugged
her
to
him
how
you
doing
there
he
said
trying
to
make
his
voice
light
though
it
came
out
so
leaden
the
words
nearly
thudded
in
the
wet
dirt
as
they
fell
from
his
mouth
she
looked
into
the
dirt
at
their
feet
and
he
took
her
chin
and
turned
her
face
up
so
that
she
was
looking
into
his
eyes
and
he
kissed
her
forehead
in
a
brotherly
way
like
an
older
brother
coming
home
with
a
sister
i
used
to
want
to
know
all
the
secrets
she
said
in
the
smallest
voice
i
used
to
want
to
understand
how
the
world
worked
little
things
like
heavy
stuff
goes
at
the
bottom
of
the
laundry
bag
or
big
things
like
the
best
way
to
get
a
boy
to
chase
you
is
to
ignore
him
or
medium
things
like
if
you
cut
an
onion
under
running
water
your
eyes
wo
sting
and
if
you
wash
your
fingers
afterward
with
they
wo
stink
i
used
to
want
to
know
all
the
secrets
and
every
time
i
learned
one
i
felt
like
i
taken
a
step
on
a
journey
to
a
place
a
destination
to
be
the
kind
of
person
who
knew
all
this
stuff
the
way
everyone
around
me
seemed
to
know
all
this
stuff
i
thought
that
once
i
knew
enough
secrets
i
be
like
them
i
do
want
to
learn
secrets
anymore
andrew
she
shrugged
off
his
arm
and
took
a
faltering
step
down
the
slope
back
toward
the
road
i
wait
in
the
car
okay
mimi
he
said
he
felt
angry
at
her
how
could
she
be
so
selfish
as
to
have
a
crisis
at
this
place
that
meant
so
much
to
him
mimi
he
said
and
swallowed
his
anger
his
three
brothers
stayed
on
his
sofa
for
a
week
though
they
only
left
one
wet
towel
on
the
floor
only
left
one
sticky
plate
in
the
sink
one
glass
on
the
counter
he
just
opened
his
first
business
the
junk
shop
not
yet
upscale
enough
to
be
called
an
antiques
shop
and
he
was
pulling
the
kinds
of
long
hours
known
only
to
er
interns
and
entrepreneurs
showing
up
at
to
do
the
books
opening
at
working
until
three
then
turning
things
over
to
a
kid
for
two
hours
while
he
drove
to
the
thrift
shops
and
picked
for
inventory
then
working
until
eight
to
catch
the
evening
trade
then
answering
creditors
and
fighting
with
the
landlord
until
ten
staggering
into
bed
at
eleven
to
sleep
a
few
hours
before
doing
it
all
over
again
so
he
gave
them
a
set
of
keys
and
bought
them
a
metropass
and
stuffed
an
old
wallet
with
in
twenties
and
wrote
his
phone
number
on
the
brim
of
a
little
pork
pie
hat
that
looked
good
on
their
head
and
turned
them
loose
on
the
city
the
shop
had
all
the
difficulties
of
any
shop
snarky
customers
shoplifting
teenagers
breakage
idiots
with
jumpy
dogs
never
enough
money
and
never
enough
time
he
loved
it
every
stinking
minute
of
it
he
never
gone
to
bed
happier
and
never
woken
up
more
full
of
energy
in
his
life
he
was
in
the
world
finally
at
last
until
his
brothers
arrived
he
took
them
to
the
store
the
first
morning
showed
them
what
wrought
with
his
own
two
hands
thought
that
he
inspire
them
to
see
what
they
could
do
when
they
entered
the
world
as
well
after
gone
home
and
grown
up
a
little
which
they
would
have
to
do
very
soon
as
he
reminded
them
at
every
chance
unmoved
by
george
hangdog
expression
at
the
thought
they
walked
around
the
shop
slowly
picking
things
up
turning
them
over
having
hilarious
embarrassing
conversations
about
the
likely
purpose
of
an
old
soloflex
machine
a
grubby
pink
epilady
leg
razor
a
bakelite
coffee
carafe
the
arguments
went
like
this
george
look
it
a
milk
container
ed
i
do
think
that
that
for
milk
fred
you
should
put
it
down
before
you
drop
it
it
looks
valuable
george
why
do
you
think
it
for
milk
look
at
the
silver
inside
that
to
reflect
off
the
white
milk
and
make
it
look
you
know
cold
and
fresh
fred
put
it
down
you
going
to
break
it
george
fine
i
put
it
down
but
tell
me
why
do
you
think
for
milk
ed
because
it
a
thermos
container
and
that
to
keep
hot
stuff
hot
and
it
got
a
screwtop
and
whatever
it
made
of
looks
like
it
take
a
hard
knock
without
breaking
and
so
on
nattering
at
each
other
like
cave
men
puzzling
over
a
walkman
until
alan
was
called
upon
to
settle
the
matter
with
the
authoritative
answer
it
got
so
that
he
set
his
alarm
for
four
so
that
he
could
sneak
past
their
snoring
form
on
the
sofa
and
so
avoid
the
awkward
desperate
pleas
to
let
them
come
with
him
into
the
shop
and
cadge
a
free
breakfast
of
poutine
and
eggs
from
the
harvey
next
door
while
they
were
at
it
george
had
taken
up
coffee
on
his
second
day
in
the
city
bugging
the
other
two
until
they
got
him
a
cup
six
or
seven
cups
a
day
so
that
they
flitted
from
place
to
place
like
a
hummingbird
thrashed
in
their
sleep
babbled
when
they
spoke
it
came
to
a
head
on
the
third
night
when
they
dropped
by
the
shop
while
he
was
on
the
phone
and
ducked
into
the
back
room
in
order
to
separate
into
threes
again
with
george
wearing
the
pork
pie
hat
even
though
it
was
a
size
too
big
for
his
head
and
hung
down
around
his
ears
adam
was
talking
to
a
woman
who
come
into
the
shop
that
afternoon
and
greatly
admired
an
institutional
sofa
from
the
whose
lines
betrayed
a
pathetic
slavish
devotion
to
danish
moderne
aesthetics
the
woman
had
sat
on
the
sofa
admired
the
sofa
walked
around
the
sofa
hand
trailing
on
its
back
had
been
fascinated
to
see
the
provenance
he
turned
up
an
inventory
sticker
from
the
university
of
toronto
maintenance
department
indicating
that
this
sofa
had
originally
been
installed
at
the
robarts
library
itself
of
great
and
glorious
aesthetic
obsolescence
here
was
adam
on
the
phone
with
this
woman
closing
a
deal
to
turn
a
profit
on
an
item
he
acquired
at
the
goodwill
center
for
five
bucks
and
here
were
his
brothers
in
the
store
angry
about
something
shouting
at
each
other
about
something
they
ran
around
like
three
fat
lunatics
reeking
of
the
bo
that
they
exuded
like
the
ass
end
of
a
cow
loud
boorish
and
indescribably
weird
weird
beyond
the
quaint
weirdness
of
his
little
curiosity
show
weird
beyond
the
interesting
weirdness
of
the
punks
and
the
goths
and
the
mods
who
were
wearing
their
subcultures
like
political
affiliations
as
they
strolled
by
the
shops
those
were
redeemable
weirds
weirds
within
the
bounds
of
normal
human
endeavor
his
brothers
on
the
other
hand
were
utterly
utterly
irredeemable
he
sank
down
behind
the
counter
as
george
said
something
to
fred
in
their
own
little
shorthand
language
a
combination
of
grunts
and
nonsense
syllables
that
the
three
had
spoken
together
for
so
long
that
he
not
even
noticed
it
until
they
were
taken
out
of
their
context
and
put
in
his
he
put
his
back
against
the
wall
and
brought
his
chest
to
his
knees
and
tried
to
sound
like
he
had
a
belly
button
as
he
said
to
the
woman
yes
absolutely
i
can
have
this
delivered
tomorrow
if
like
to
courier
over
a
check
this
check
it
was
enough
money
to
keep
his
business
afloat
for
another
days
to
pay
his
rent
and
pay
the
kid
and
buy
his
groceries
and
there
were
his
brothers
and
now
ed
was
barking
like
a
dog
a
rare
moment
of
mirth
from
him
who
had
been
the
sober
outer
bark
since
he
was
a
child
and
rarely
acted
like
the
he
was
behaving
like
today
is
everything
all
right
she
said
down
the
phone
this
woman
been
smartly
turned
out
in
a
cashmere
sweater
and
a
checked
scarf
and
a
pair
of
jeans
that
looked
new
and
good
over
her
designer
shoes
with
little
heels
they
flirted
a
little
even
though
she
was
at
least
ten
years
older
than
him
because
flirting
was
a
new
thing
for
alan
and
he
discovered
that
he
was
bad
at
it
everything
is
fine
he
said
just
some
goofballs
out
in
the
street
out
front
how
about
if
i
drop
off
the
sofa
for
six
killed
her
cut
her
up
sliced
her
open
george
screeched
suddenly
skidding
around
the
counter
rolling
past
him
yanking
the
phone
out
of
the
wall
and
in
that
moment
he
realized
what
the
sounds
they
had
been
making
in
their
private
speech
had
been
they
had
been
a
reenactment
a
grunting
squeaking
playback
of
the
day
the
fateful
day
the
day
he
taken
his
knife
and
done
his
mischief
with
it
he
reached
for
the
phone
cable
and
plugged
it
back
into
the
wall
but
it
was
as
though
his
hand
were
moving
of
its
own
accord
because
his
attention
was
focused
elsewhere
on
the
three
of
them
arrayed
in
a
triangle
as
they
had
been
on
the
hillside
as
they
had
been
when
they
had
chanted
at
him
when
the
knife
grip
was
sure
in
the
palm
of
his
hands
the
ritual
that
what
it
was
it
was
a
the
ritual
had
the
feel
of
something
worn
smooth
with
countless
repetitions
he
found
himself
rigid
with
shock
offended
to
his
bones
this
was
what
they
did
now
in
the
cave
with
davey
sitting
atop
their
mother
black
and
shriveled
this
was
how
they
behaved
running
through
this
reenactment
of
his
great
shame
of
the
day
danny
died
no
wonder
darrel
had
terrorized
them
out
of
their
home
they
were
beyond
odd
and
eccentric
they
were
unfit
unfit
for
polite
company
for
human
society
the
phone
in
his
hand
rang
it
was
the
woman
you
know
i
thinking
that
maybe
i
should
come
back
in
with
a
tape
measure
and
measure
up
the
sofa
before
i
commit
to
it
it
a
lot
of
money
and
to
be
honest
i
just
do
know
if
i
have
room
what
if
i
measure
it
for
you
i
could
measure
it
for
you
and
call
you
back
with
the
numbers
the
three
brothers
stared
at
him
with
identical
glassy
alien
stares
that
okay
i
can
come
in
and
he
knew
that
she
meant
wo
ever
come
in
again
what
if
i
bring
it
by
anyway
i
could
bring
it
by
tomorrow
night
and
you
could
see
it
and
make
up
your
mind
no
obligation
that
very
kind
of
you
but
i
afraid
that
i
be
out
tomorrow
evening
friday
i
could
come
by
friday
he
was
trying
to
remember
how
to
flirt
now
but
he
could
i
could
come
by
and
we
could
have
a
glass
of
wine
or
something
and
he
knew
he
said
the
exact
wrong
thing
it
all
right
she
said
coldly
i
come
by
later
in
the
week
to
have
another
look
i
have
to
go
now
my
husband
is
home
and
he
was
pretty
sure
she
was
married
but
he
said
good
bye
and
hung
up
the
phone
he
looked
at
his
solemn
brothers
now
and
they
looked
at
him
when
are
you
going
home
he
said
and
edward
looked
satisfied
and
fred
looked
a
little
disappointed
and
george
looked
like
he
wanted
to
throw
himself
in
front
of
a
subway
and
his
bottom
lip
began
to
tremble
it
was
ed
game
he
said
the
davey
game
it
was
his
he
pointed
a
finger
you
know
i
not
like
them
i
can
be
on
my
own
i
what
need
they
not
what
need
the
other
two
stared
at
their
fat
bellies
in
the
direction
of
their
fat
feet
andrew
had
never
heard
george
say
this
had
never
even
suspected
that
this
thought
lurked
in
his
heart
but
now
that
it
was
out
on
the
table
it
seemed
like
a
pretty
obvious
fact
to
have
taken
note
of
all
things
being
equal
things
were
equal
he
was
cold
and
numb
that
a
really
terrible
thing
to
say
george
is
what
he
said
that
easy
for
you
to
say
is
what
george
said
you
are
here
you
are
in
the
it
easy
for
you
to
say
that
we
should
be
happy
with
things
the
way
they
are
george
turned
on
his
heel
and
put
his
head
down
and
bulled
out
the
door
slamming
it
behind
him
so
that
the
mail
slot
rattled
and
the
glass
shook
and
a
stack
of
nice
melamine
cafeteria
trays
fell
off
a
shelf
and
clattered
to
the
ground
he
did
come
back
that
night
he
did
come
back
the
next
day
ed
and
fred
held
their
grumbling
tummies
and
chewed
at
the
insides
of
their
plump
cheeks
and
sat
on
the
unsold
danish
modern
sofa
in
the
shop
and
freaked
out
the
few
customers
that
drifted
in
and
then
drifted
out
this
is
worse
than
last
time
ed
said
licking
his
lips
and
staring
at
the
donut
that
albert
refused
to
feel
guilty
about
eating
in
front
of
them
last
time
he
said
not
missing
felix
quick
warning
glare
at
ed
even
though
ed
appeared
to
he
went
away
for
a
whole
day
just
disappeared
into
town
when
he
came
back
he
said
that
he
needed
some
away
time
that
he
had
an
amazing
day
on
his
own
that
he
wanted
to
come
and
see
you
and
that
he
do
it
whether
we
wanted
to
come
or
not
ah
alvin
said
understanding
then
how
the
three
had
come
to
be
staying
with
him
he
wondered
how
long
they
last
without
the
middle
without
the
ability
to
eat
he
remembered
holding
the
infant
eddie
in
his
arms
the
boy
light
and
hollowed
out
he
remembered
holding
the
three
boys
at
once
heavy
as
a
bowling
ball
ah
he
said
i
have
to
have
a
word
with
him
when
greg
came
home
alan
was
waiting
for
him
sitting
on
the
sofa
holding
his
head
up
with
one
hand
eli
and
fred
snored
uneasily
in
his
bed
breathing
heavily
through
their
noses
hey
he
said
as
he
came
through
the
door
scuffing
at
the
lock
with
his
key
for
a
minute
or
two
first
he
was
rumpled
and
dirty
streaked
with
grime
on
his
jawline
and
hair
hanging
limp
and
greasy
over
his
forehead
greg
alan
said
nodding
straightening
out
his
spine
and
listening
to
it
pop
i
back
george
said
looking
down
at
his
sneakers
which
squished
with
grey
water
that
oozed
over
his
carpet
art
did
say
anything
just
sat
pat
and
waited
the
way
he
did
sometimes
when
con
artists
came
into
the
shop
with
some
kind
of
scam
that
they
wanted
him
to
play
along
with
it
worked
the
same
with
george
after
a
hard
stare
at
his
shoes
he
shook
his
head
and
began
to
defend
himself
revealing
the
things
that
he
knew
were
indefensible
i
had
to
do
it
i
just
had
to
i
could
live
in
that
cave
with
that
thing
anymore
i
could
live
inside
those
two
anymore
i
going
crazy
there
a
whole
world
out
here
and
every
day
i
get
farther
away
from
it
i
get
weirder
i
just
wanted
to
be
normal
i
just
wanted
to
be
like
you
they
stopped
letting
me
into
the
clubs
after
i
ran
out
of
money
and
they
kicked
me
out
of
the
i
tried
to
ride
the
subway
all
night
but
they
threw
me
off
at
the
end
of
the
line
so
i
ended
up
digging
a
transfer
out
of
a
trash
can
and
taking
an
bus
back
downtown
no
one
looked
at
me
twice
that
whole
time
except
to
make
sure
that
i
was
gone
i
walked
back
here
from
eglinton
that
was
five
miles
away
a
good
forty
minute
walk
in
the
night
and
the
cold
and
the
dark
greg
pried
off
his
sneakers
with
his
toes
and
then
pulled
off
his
grey
squelching
socks
i
could
find
anyone
who
let
me
use
the
toilet
he
said
and
alan
saw
the
stain
on
his
pants
he
stood
up
and
took
greg
by
the
cold
hand
as
he
had
when
they
were
both
boys
and
said
it
all
right
gord
we
get
you
cleaned
up
and
changed
and
put
you
to
bed
okay
just
put
your
stuff
in
the
hamper
in
the
bathroom
and
i
find
you
a
change
of
clothes
and
make
a
couple
sandwiches
all
right
and
just
as
easy
as
that
george
spirit
was
tamed
he
came
out
of
the
shower
pink
and
steaming
and
scrubbed
put
on
the
sweats
that
adam
found
for
him
in
an
old
gym
bag
ate
his
sandwiches
and
climbed
into
bed
with
his
brothers
when
he
saw
them
again
next
they
were
reassembled
and
downcast
though
they
ate
the
instant
oatmeal
with
raisins
and
cream
that
he
set
out
for
them
with
gusto
i
think
a
bus
ticket
home
is
about
forty
bucks
right
alan
said
as
he
poured
himself
a
coffee
they
looked
up
at
him
ed
eyes
were
grateful
his
lips
clamped
shut
and
you
need
some
food
on
the
road
another
fifty
or
sixty
bucks
okay
ed
nodded
and
adam
set
down
a
brown
bill
then
put
a
purple
ten
on
top
of
it
for
the
taxi
to
the
greyhound
station
he
added
they
finished
their
oatmeal
in
silence
while
adam
puttered
around
the
apartment
stripping
the
sheets
and
oily
pillowcases
off
his
bed
rinsing
the
hairs
off
the
soap
cleaning
the
toilet
erasing
the
signs
of
their
stay
well
he
said
at
length
i
should
get
going
to
the
shop
yeah
ed
said
in
george
voice
and
it
cracked
before
he
could
close
his
lips
again
right
adam
said
well
they
patted
their
mouth
and
ran
stubby
fingers
through
their
lank
hair
already
thinning
though
they
were
still
in
their
teens
they
stood
and
cracked
their
knuckles
against
the
table
they
patted
their
pockets
absently
then
pocketed
the
hundred
and
the
ten
well
adam
said
they
left
turning
to
give
him
the
keys
he
had
cut
for
them
a
gesture
that
left
him
feeling
obscurely
embarrassed
and
even
though
he
told
himself
he
put
them
up
and
put
up
with
them
very
patiently
indeed
and
then
he
left
and
locked
the
door
with
his
spare
keys
useless
spare
keys
no
one
would
ever
come
to
stay
with
him
again
what
i
found
in
the
cave
he
said
lying
in
the
grass
on
the
hillside
breathing
hard
the
taste
of
vomit
sour
in
his
mouth
his
arms
and
legs
sore
from
the
pumping
run
down
the
hillside
what
i
found
in
the
cave
he
said
and
she
held
his
hand
nervously
her
fingers
not
sure
of
how
hard
to
squeeze
whether
to
caress
what
i
found
in
the
cave
he
said
and
was
glad
that
she
had
come
with
him
had
been
there
for
what
he
seen
and
heard
what
i
found
in
the
cave
was
the
body
of
my
first
girlfriend
her
skeleton
polished
to
a
gleam
and
laid
out
carefully
on
the
floor
her
red
hair
in
a
long
plait
brushed
out
and
brittle
circled
over
her
small
skull
like
a
halo
he
laid
her
out
before
my
mother
and
placed
her
fingernails
at
the
exact
tips
of
her
fingerbones
the
floor
was
dirty
and
littered
with
rags
and
trash
it
was
dark
and
it
stank
of
shit
there
were
piles
of
shit
here
and
there
the
places
where
my
brothers
had
slept
had
been
torn
apart
my
brother
bradley
his
nook
was
caved
in
i
moved
some
of
the
rocks
but
i
find
him
under
there
benny
was
gone
craig
was
gone
ed
frankie
and
george
were
gone
even
davey
was
gone
all
the
parts
of
the
cave
that
made
it
home
were
gone
except
for
my
mother
who
was
rusted
and
sat
askew
on
the
uneven
floor
one
of
her
feet
had
rusted
through
and
her
generator
had
run
dry
and
she
was
silent
and
dry
with
a
of
leaves
and
guano
and
gunk
sliming
her
basket
i
went
down
to
the
cave
where
my
father
spoke
to
us
and
i
found
that
i
i
i
found
that
i
could
see
in
the
dark
anymore
i
never
had
a
moment
pause
in
the
halls
of
my
father
but
now
i
walked
falteringly
the
sounds
of
my
footsteps
not
like
the
steps
of
a
son
of
the
mountain
at
all
i
heard
them
echo
back
and
they
sounded
like
an
outsider
and
i
fell
twice
and
hurt
my
head
here
he
touched
the
goose
egg
he
raised
on
his
forehead
and
i
got
dizzy
and
then
i
was
in
the
pool
but
it
did
sound
right
and
i
could
hear
it
right
and
i
got
my
clothes
off
and
then
i
stood
there
with
them
in
my
arms
his
hand
came
back
bloody
and
he
wiped
it
absently
on
the
grass
and
mimi
took
hold
of
it
because
if
i
put
them
down
it
was
dark
and
i
never
find
them
again
so
i
bundled
them
all
up
and
carried
them
over
my
head
and
i
waded
in
and
the
water
had
never
been
so
cold
and
had
never
felt
so
oily
and
there
was
a
smell
to
it
a
stagnant
smell
i
waded
out
and
i
stood
and
i
shivered
and
i
whispered
father
and
i
listened
i
heard
the
sound
of
the
water
i
disturbed
lapping
around
my
ears
and
up
on
the
shore
i
smelled
the
sewage
and
oil
smell
but
none
of
the
habitual
smells
of
my
father
clean
water
coalface
sulfur
grass
and
lime
i
picked
my
way
out
of
the
water
again
and
i
walked
to
the
shore
and
it
was
too
dark
to
put
on
my
clothes
so
i
carried
them
under
one
arm
and
felt
my
way
back
to
the
summer
cave
and
leaned
against
my
mother
and
waited
to
drip
dry
i
stepped
in
something
soft
that
squished
and
smelled
between
my
mother
and
my
father
and
i
did
want
to
put
on
my
socks
until
i
wiped
it
off
but
i
could
bring
myself
to
wipe
it
on
the
cave
floor
marci
eye
sockets
looked
up
at
the
ceiling
she
been
laid
out
with
so
much
care
i
could
believe
that
davey
had
had
anything
to
do
with
it
i
thought
that
benny
must
be
around
somewhere
looking
in
taking
care
i
closed
my
eyes
so
that
i
was
looking
into
the
terrible
recriminating
stare
and
i
leaned
my
head
up
against
my
mother
and
i
breathed
until
the
stink
got
to
me
and
then
i
pried
myself
upright
and
walked
out
of
the
cave
i
stopped
and
stood
in
the
mouth
of
the
cave
and
listened
as
hard
as
i
could
but
my
father
was
speaking
and
the
smell
was
getting
to
me
she
got
him
dressed
and
she
fed
him
sips
of
water
and
she
got
him
standing
and
walked
him
in
circles
around
the
little
paddock
collapsed
in
i
need
to
get
georgie
out
of
the
car
he
said
i
going
to
leave
him
in
the
cave
it
right
she
bit
her
lip
and
nodded
slowly
i
can
help
you
with
that
she
said
i
do
need
help
he
said
lamely
i
did
say
you
did
but
i
can
help
anyway
they
walked
down
slowly
him
leaning
on
her
arm
like
an
old
man
steps
faltering
in
the
scree
on
the
slope
they
came
to
the
road
and
stood
before
the
trunk
as
the
cars
whizzed
past
them
he
opened
the
trunk
and
looked
down
the
journey
had
been
good
to
gregg
he
come
undone
from
his
winding
sheet
and
lay
face
down
neck
stiff
his
nose
mashed
against
the
floor
of
the
trunk
his
skin
had
started
to
flake
off
leaving
a
kind
of
scale
or
dandruff
on
the
flat
industrial
upholstery
inside
the
trunk
alan
gingerly
tugged
loose
the
sheet
and
began
awkwardly
to
wrap
it
around
his
brother
ignoring
the
grit
of
shed
skin
and
hair
that
clung
to
his
fingers
mimi
shook
him
by
the
shoulder
hard
and
he
realized
she
been
shaking
him
for
some
time
you
ca
do
that
here
she
said
would
you
listen
to
me
you
ca
do
that
here
someone
will
see
she
held
something
up
his
keys
i
back
it
up
to
the
trailhead
she
said
close
the
trunk
and
wait
for
me
there
she
got
behind
the
wheel
and
he
sloped
off
to
the
trailhead
and
stood
numbly
holding
the
lump
on
his
forehead
and
staring
at
a
rusted
coke
can
in
a
muddy
puddle
she
backed
the
car
up
almost
to
his
shins
put
it
in
park
and
came
around
to
the
trunk
she
popped
the
lid
and
looked
in
and
wrinkled
her
nose
okay
she
said
i
get
him
covered
and
we
carry
him
up
the
hill
mimi
he
began
mimi
it
okay
you
do
need
to
go
in
there
for
me
i
know
it
hard
for
you
she
squeezed
his
hand
i
over
it
andy
now
that
i
know
what
up
there
it
not
scary
any
longer
he
watched
her
shoulders
work
watched
her
wings
work
as
she
wrapped
up
his
brother
when
she
was
done
he
took
one
end
of
the
bundle
and
hoisted
it
trying
to
ignore
the
rain
of
skin
and
hair
that
shook
off
over
the
bumper
and
his
trousers
up
we
go
she
said
and
moved
to
take
the
front
tell
me
when
to
turn
they
had
to
set
him
down
twice
before
they
made
it
all
the
way
up
the
hill
the
first
time
they
just
stood
in
silence
wiping
their
cramped
hands
on
their
thighs
the
second
time
she
came
to
him
and
put
her
arm
around
his
shoulders
and
gave
him
a
soft
kiss
on
the
cheek
that
felt
like
a
feather
almost
there
she
said
he
nodded
and
bent
to
pick
up
his
end
mimi
plunged
through
the
cave
mouth
without
a
moment
hesitation
and
they
set
him
down
just
inside
the
entrance
near
a
pair
of
stained
cotton
alan
waited
for
his
heart
to
stop
thudding
and
the
sweat
to
cool
on
his
brow
and
then
he
kicked
the
underwear
away
as
an
afterthought
god
he
said
she
moved
to
him
put
her
arm
around
his
shoulder
you
being
brave
she
said
god
he
said
again
let
it
out
you
know
if
you
want
to
but
he
did
he
wanted
to
sit
down
he
moved
to
his
mother
side
and
leaned
against
her
mimi
sat
on
her
hunkers
before
him
and
took
his
hand
and
tried
to
tilt
his
chin
up
with
one
finger
but
he
resisted
her
pull
and
she
rose
and
began
to
explore
the
cave
he
heard
her
stop
near
marci
skeleton
for
a
long
while
then
move
some
more
she
circled
him
and
his
mother
then
opened
her
lid
and
stared
into
her
hamper
he
wanted
to
tell
her
not
to
touch
his
mother
but
the
words
sounded
ridiculous
in
his
head
and
he
did
dare
find
out
how
stupid
they
sounded
moving
through
freespace
and
then
the
washing
machine
bucked
and
made
a
snapping
sound
and
hummed
to
life
generator
dead
he
thought
she
all
rusted
through
and
still
the
washing
machine
moved
he
heard
the
gush
of
water
filling
her
a
wet
and
muddy
sound
what
did
you
do
he
asked
he
climbed
slowly
to
his
feet
facing
away
from
his
mother
not
wanting
to
see
her
terrible
bucking
as
she
wobbled
on
her
broken
foot
nothing
mimi
said
i
just
looked
inside
and
it
started
up
he
stared
at
his
mother
enraptured
mesmerized
mimi
stole
alongside
of
him
and
he
noticed
that
she
taken
off
her
jacket
and
the
sweatshirt
splaying
out
her
wings
around
her
her
hand
found
his
and
squeezed
the
machine
rocked
his
mother
rocked
and
gurgled
and
rushed
and
then
she
found
some
local
point
of
stability
and
settled
into
a
soft
rocking
rhythm
the
rush
of
water
echoed
off
the
cave
walls
a
shushing
that
sounded
like
skis
cutting
through
powder
it
was
a
beautiful
sound
one
that
transported
him
to
a
million
mornings
spent
waiting
for
the
laundry
to
finish
and
be
hung
on
the
line
gone
he
jerked
his
head
up
so
fast
that
something
in
his
neck
cracked
needling
pain
up
into
his
temples
and
forehead
he
looked
at
mimi
but
she
gave
no
sign
of
having
heard
the
voice
the
words
gone
gone
mimi
looked
at
him
and
cocked
her
head
what
she
said
he
touched
her
lips
with
a
finger
forgetting
to
be
mindful
of
the
swelling
there
and
she
flinched
away
there
was
a
rustle
of
wings
and
clothing
sons
all
my
sons
gone
the
voice
emerged
from
that
roar
of
water
humming
and
sloshing
back
and
forth
in
her
basket
mimi
squeezed
his
hand
so
hard
he
felt
the
bones
grate
mom
he
said
softly
his
voice
cracking
he
took
half
a
step
toward
the
washer
tired
i
worn
out
i
been
worn
out
he
touched
the
enamel
on
the
lid
of
the
washer
and
felt
the
vibrations
through
his
fingertips
i
can
i
can
take
you
home
he
said
take
care
of
you
in
the
city
late
there
was
a
snapping
sound
and
then
a
front
corner
of
the
machine
settled
heavily
one
rusted
out
foot
broken
clean
off
rolled
across
the
cave
floor
the
water
sounds
stilled
mimi
breathed
some
words
something
like
oh
my
god
but
maybe
in
another
language
or
maybe
he
just
forgotten
his
own
tongue
i
need
to
go
he
said
they
stayed
in
a
different
motel
on
their
way
home
from
the
mountain
and
mimi
tried
to
cuddle
him
as
he
lay
in
the
bed
but
her
wings
got
in
the
way
and
he
edged
over
to
his
side
until
he
was
almost
falling
off
before
she
took
the
hint
and
curled
up
on
her
side
he
lay
still
until
he
heard
her
snore
softly
then
rose
and
went
and
sat
on
the
toilet
head
in
his
hands
staring
at
the
moldy
grout
on
the
tiled
floor
in
the
white
light
trying
not
to
think
of
the
bones
the
hank
of
brittle
red
hair
tied
tightly
in
a
shopping
bag
in
the
trunk
of
the
rental
car
sunrise
found
him
pacing
the
bathroom
waiting
for
mimi
to
stir
and
when
she
padded
in
and
sat
on
the
toilet
she
would
meet
his
eye
he
found
himself
thinking
of
her
standing
in
the
tub
rolled
towel
between
her
teeth
as
krishna
approached
her
wings
with
his
knife
and
he
went
back
into
the
room
to
dress
we
going
to
eat
breakfast
she
asked
in
the
smallest
voice
he
said
nothing
could
will
himself
to
talk
there
still
food
in
the
car
she
said
after
some
silence
had
slipped
by
we
can
eat
that
and
without
any
more
words
they
climbed
into
the
car
and
he
put
the
pedal
down
all
the
way
to
toronto
stopping
only
once
for
gas
and
cigarettes
after
he
smoked
all
the
ones
left
in
her
pack
when
they
cleared
the
city
limits
and
drove
under
the
viaduct
at
danforth
avenue
getting
into
the
proper
downtown
he
eased
off
the
parkway
and
into
the
city
traffic
taking
the
main
roads
with
their
high
buildings
and
stoplights
and
people
people
people
we
going
home
she
said
the
last
thing
she
said
was
are
you
hungry
fourteen
hours
before
and
he
only
shook
his
head
yes
he
said
oh
she
said
was
krishna
home
she
was
rooting
in
her
purse
now
and
he
knew
that
she
was
looking
for
her
knife
you
staying
with
me
he
said
can
i
she
said
they
were
at
a
red
light
so
he
looked
into
her
eyes
they
were
shiny
and
empty
as
marbles
yes
he
said
of
course
and
i
will
have
a
word
with
krishna
she
looked
out
the
window
i
expect
he
want
to
have
a
word
with
you
too
link
rang
his
doorbell
one
morning
while
he
was
hunched
over
his
computer
thinking
about
the
story
he
was
going
to
write
when
moved
into
the
house
he
felt
the
shape
of
that
story
all
the
while
that
he
sanded
and
screwed
in
bookcases
it
had
floated
just
below
the
surface
its
silhouette
discernible
through
the
ripples
but
when
adam
left
mimi
watching
television
and
sat
at
his
desk
in
the
evening
with
the
humming
unscuffed
and
gleaming
laptop
before
him
fingers
poised
over
the
keys
nothing
came
he
tapped
out
an
opening
sentence
i
suspect
that
my
father
is
dead
and
deleted
it
then
undid
the
delete
he
called
up
the
inventory
and
stroked
the
spacebar
with
his
thumb
paging
through
screensful
of
pictures
and
keywords
and
pricetags
and
receipts
he
flipped
back
to
the
story
and
deleted
his
sentence
my
dead
brother
had
been
hiding
out
on
the
synagogue
roof
for
god
knows
how
long
the
last
thing
he
wanted
was
to
write
an
autobiography
he
wanted
to
write
a
story
about
the
real
world
about
the
real
people
who
inhabited
it
he
hit
the
delete
key
the
girl
never
got
bored
behind
her
counter
because
she
could
always
while
away
the
hours
looking
up
the
rental
histories
of
the
popular
girls
who
shunned
her
in
high
school
that
when
link
rang
his
doorbell
and
he
startled
guiltily
and
quit
the
text
editor
saving
the
opening
sentence
which
had
a
lot
of
promise
he
thought
link
he
said
come
in
the
kid
had
put
on
ten
or
fifteen
pounds
since
they
first
met
and
no
longer
made
alan
want
to
shout
administer
a
most
of
it
was
muscle
from
hard
riding
as
a
bike
messenger
a
gig
that
link
had
kept
up
right
through
the
cold
winter
dressing
up
like
a
martian
in
tights
and
ski
goggles
and
a
fleece
that
showed
hints
of
purple
beneath
its
skin
of
crusted
road
salt
and
pollution
andrew
had
noticed
the
girls
in
the
market
and
at
kurt
shop
noticing
link
whose
spring
wardrobe
showed
off
all
that
new
muscle
to
new
effect
and
gathered
from
the
various
hurt
looks
and
sulks
from
the
various
girls
that
link
was
getting
more
ass
than
a
her
brother
spent
the
winter
turning
into
the
kind
of
stud
that
she
figured
out
how
to
avoid
before
she
finished
high
school
and
it
pained
her
to
see
the
hordes
of
making
eyes
at
him
that
would
be
a
good
second
sentence
for
his
story
you
okay
abby
link
said
looking
concerned
albert
realized
that
he
been
on
another
planet
for
a
moment
there
sorry
just
fell
down
a
rabbit
hole
he
said
flapping
his
arms
comically
i
was
writing
felt
to
say
that
and
i
in
a
bit
of
a
how
you
say
creative
fog
link
took
a
step
back
i
do
want
to
disturb
you
he
said
but
for
all
that
she
still
approved
his
outfits
before
he
left
the
house
refusing
to
let
him
succumb
to
the
ephemeral
awful
trendiness
of
caps
and
jamboree
shirts
instead
she
put
him
into
slightly
fitted
cotton
shirts
that
emphasized
his
long
lean
belly
and
his
broad
shoulders
do
sweat
it
i
could
use
a
break
come
in
and
have
a
drink
or
something
he
checked
the
yellowing
face
of
the
clock
he
kept
on
the
mantelpiece
and
saw
that
it
was
just
past
noon
past
lunchtime
that
means
that
it
okay
to
crack
a
beer
you
want
a
beer
and
for
all
that
her
brother
still
managed
to
come
home
looking
like
some
kind
of
the
kind
of
boy
always
hoped
he
would
be
beer
would
be
great
link
said
he
stepped
into
the
cool
of
the
living
room
and
blinked
as
his
eyes
adjusted
this
really
is
a
hell
of
a
place
he
said
looking
around
at
the
glass
cases
the
teetering
stacks
of
books
that
andrew
had
pulled
down
and
not
reshelved
making
ziggurats
of
them
instead
next
to
all
the
chairs
what
can
i
do
for
you
adam
said
handing
him
a
glass
of
upper
canada
lager
with
a
little
wedge
of
lime
he
bought
a
few
cases
of
beer
that
week
and
had
been
going
through
them
steadily
in
the
living
room
paging
through
the
most
favored
of
his
books
trying
to
find
something
though
he
was
sure
what
link
sipped
summer
here
he
said
yeah
alan
said
well
the
thing
is
summer
i
going
to
be
working
longer
hours
and
you
know
evenings
well
i
mean
i
years
old
andy
alan
raised
an
eyebrow
and
sat
back
in
his
chair
what
the
message
you
trying
to
convey
to
me
link
i
not
going
to
be
going
around
your
friend
shop
anymore
i
really
had
fun
doing
it
all
year
but
i
want
to
try
something
different
with
my
spare
time
this
summer
you
understand
sure
alan
said
he
had
kids
quit
on
him
before
that
what
kids
did
attention
spans
right
and
well
you
know
i
never
really
understood
what
we
were
which
part
the
wifi
stuff
well
you
see
stop
okay
i
heard
you
explain
it
ten
times
now
and
i
still
get
it
maybe
after
a
semester
or
two
of
electrical
engineering
make
more
sense
okay
adam
said
smiling
broadly
to
show
no
hard
feelings
hey
he
said
carefully
if
you
did
understand
what
we
were
doing
then
why
did
you
do
it
link
cocked
his
head
as
if
examining
him
for
traces
of
sarcasm
then
looked
away
i
do
know
it
was
exciting
even
if
i
did
quite
get
it
everyone
else
seemed
to
get
it
sort
of
and
it
was
fun
to
work
alongside
of
them
and
sometimes
the
money
was
okay
which
is
why
she
decided
to
damn
what
did
she
decide
to
do
that
was
shaping
up
to
be
a
really
good
opener
which
is
why
she
was
surprised
when
he
did
come
home
for
three
nights
in
a
row
aha
no
hard
feelings
link
adam
said
i
really
grateful
for
the
help
you
gave
us
and
i
hope
you
think
about
helping
again
in
the
fall
but
on
the
fourth
night
she
got
worried
and
she
started
calling
his
friends
they
were
all
poor
students
so
none
of
them
had
numbers
you
could
look
up
in
the
phone
book
but
that
was
okay
since
they
all
had
accounts
with
the
video
store
where
she
worked
with
their
deadbeat
mobile
numbers
listed
yeah
that
sounds
great
you
know
september
it
gets
dark
early
just
got
word
that
i
got
into
ryerson
for
the
fall
so
i
be
taking
engineering
classes
maybe
i
can
help
out
that
way
perfect
alan
said
link
took
a
step
backward
drained
his
beer
held
out
the
glass
well
thanks
link
said
and
turned
alan
reached
past
him
and
opened
the
door
there
were
a
couple
of
girls
there
little
suburban
girls
of
the
type
that
you
could
find
by
the
hatful
in
the
market
on
saturday
mornings
shopping
for
crazy
clothes
at
the
vintage
shops
they
looked
but
might
have
been
as
old
as
or
and
just
heartbreakingly
naive
link
looked
over
his
shoulder
and
had
the
decency
to
look
slightly
embarrassed
as
they
smiled
at
him
okay
thanks
then
he
said
and
one
of
the
girls
looked
past
him
to
get
a
glimpse
inside
the
house
andy
instinctively
stepped
aside
to
give
her
a
better
view
of
his
showroom
and
he
was
about
to
offer
her
a
soda
before
he
caught
himself
you
got
a
nice
place
she
said
look
at
all
those
books
her
friend
said
have
you
read
all
those
books
she
was
wearing
thick
concealer
over
her
acne
but
she
had
a
round
face
and
lips
that
he
would
have
been
surprised
to
see
on
the
cover
of
a
magazine
she
said
it
with
a
kind
of
sneer
link
said
are
you
kidding
what
the
point
of
a
houseful
of
books
you
already
read
they
both
laughed
adoringly
if
adam
was
feeling
uncharitable
say
it
was
simpering
not
laughing
and
took
off
for
the
exciting
throngs
in
the
market
alan
watched
them
go
with
link
empty
glass
in
one
hand
and
his
full
glass
in
the
other
it
was
hot
out
in
the
market
sunny
and
it
felt
like
the
spring
had
rushed
up
on
him
and
taken
him
by
surprise
when
he
was
looking
he
had
owned
the
house
for
more
than
a
year
now
and
the
story
only
had
three
or
four
paragraphs
to
it
and
none
of
them
were
written
down
yet
you
ca
wash
shit
is
what
her
mother
said
when
she
called
home
and
asked
what
she
should
do
about
her
brother
that
been
a
since
he
was
five
years
old
he
should
write
the
story
down
he
went
back
upstairs
and
sat
down
at
the
keyboard
and
pecked
out
the
sentences
that
had
come
to
him
but
they
seemed
very
sterile
there
aglow
on
the
screen
in
just
the
same
way
that
they
felt
restless
and
alive
a
moment
before
the
sunny
day
beamed
through
the
study
window
and
put
a
glare
up
on
his
screen
that
made
it
hard
to
type
and
when
he
moved
to
the
other
side
of
the
desk
he
found
himself
looking
out
the
window
at
the
city
and
the
spring
he
checked
his
calendar
and
his
watch
and
saw
that
he
only
had
a
couple
hours
before
the
reporter
from
now
magazine
came
by
the
reporter
a
summer
intern
was
the
only
person
to
respond
to
his
press
release
on
the
open
network
he
and
kurt
had
argued
about
the
wording
all
night
and
when
he
was
done
he
almost
pitched
it
out
as
the
editorial
thrash
had
gutted
it
to
the
point
of
meaninglessness
oh
well
the
breeze
made
the
new
leaves
in
the
trees
across
the
street
sway
and
now
the
sun
was
in
his
eyes
and
the
sentences
were
inert
on
the
screen
he
closed
the
lid
of
the
laptop
and
grabbed
his
coat
and
left
the
house
as
fast
as
he
could
obscurely
worried
that
if
he
did
leave
then
he
would
get
out
all
day
as
he
got
closer
to
kurt
storefront
he
slowed
down
the
crowds
were
thick
laughing
suburban
kids
and
old
men
in
cardigans
and
fisherman
caps
and
subcultural
tropical
fish
of
all
kinds
goths
and
punks
and
six
kinds
of
ravers
and
hippies
and
so
forth
he
spied
link
sitting
on
the
steps
leading
up
to
one
of
the
apartments
passing
a
cigarette
to
a
little
girl
who
sat
between
his
knees
link
did
see
him
he
was
laughing
at
something
the
boy
behind
him
said
alan
looked
closer
it
was
krishna
except
he
shaved
his
head
and
was
wearing
a
hoodie
with
glittering
piping
run
along
the
double
seams
a
kind
of
raver
jumper
that
looked
like
it
had
been
abandoned
on
the
set
of
krishna
had
his
own
little
girl
between
knees
with
lips
and
thick
matte
concealer
over
her
zits
his
hand
lay
casually
on
her
shoulder
and
she
brushed
her
cheek
against
it
alan
felt
the
air
whuff
out
of
him
as
though
he
been
punched
in
the
stomach
and
he
leaned
up
against
the
side
of
a
fruit
market
flattening
himself
there
he
turned
his
head
from
side
to
side
expecting
to
see
mimi
and
wanting
to
rush
out
and
shield
her
from
the
sight
but
she
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
and
anyway
what
business
was
it
of
his
and
then
he
spied
natalie
standing
at
the
other
end
of
the
street
holding
on
to
the
handles
of
one
of
the
show
bicycles
out
front
of
bikes
on
wheels
she
was
watching
her
brother
closely
with
narrowed
eyes
it
was
her
fault
in
some
way
or
at
least
she
thought
it
was
she
caught
him
looking
at
internet
porn
and
laughed
at
him
humiliating
him
telling
him
he
should
get
out
and
find
a
girl
whose
last
name
was
jpeg
he
saw
that
her
hands
were
clenched
into
fists
and
realized
that
his
were
too
it
was
her
fault
in
some
way
because
she
seen
the
kind
of
person
he
was
hanging
out
with
and
she
had
done
a
thing
about
it
he
moved
into
the
crowd
and
waded
through
it
up
the
street
on
the
opposite
side
from
his
neighbors
he
closed
in
on
natalie
and
ended
up
right
in
front
of
her
before
she
noticed
he
was
there
oh
she
said
and
blushed
hard
she
been
growing
out
her
hair
for
a
couple
months
and
it
was
long
enough
to
clip
a
couple
of
barrettes
to
with
the
hair
she
looked
less
skinny
a
little
older
a
little
less
vulnerable
she
tugged
at
a
hank
of
it
absently
hi
we
going
to
do
anything
about
that
he
said
jerking
his
head
toward
the
steps
krishna
had
his
hand
down
the
little
girl
top
now
cupping
her
breast
then
laughing
when
she
slapped
it
away
she
shrugged
bit
her
lip
she
shook
her
head
angrily
none
of
my
business
none
of
business
she
looked
at
her
feet
look
there
a
thing
i
been
meaning
to
tell
you
i
do
think
i
can
keep
on
volunteering
at
the
shop
okay
got
stuff
to
do
assignments
and
i
taking
some
extra
shifts
at
the
store
he
held
up
a
hand
i
grateful
for
all
the
work
you
done
natalie
you
do
need
to
apologize
okay
she
said
she
looked
indecisively
around
then
seemed
to
make
up
her
mind
and
she
hugged
him
hard
take
care
of
yourself
okay
it
struck
him
as
funny
i
can
take
care
of
myself
just
fine
worry
about
me
for
a
second
you
still
looking
for
fashion
work
i
think
will
be
hiring
for
the
summer
i
could
put
in
that
no
she
said
no
that
okay
she
looked
over
his
shoulder
and
her
eyes
widened
he
turned
around
and
saw
that
krishna
and
link
had
spotted
them
and
that
krishna
was
whispering
something
in
link
ear
that
was
making
link
grin
nastily
i
should
go
she
said
krishna
hand
was
still
down
the
little
top
and
he
jiggled
her
breast
at
alan
the
reporter
had
two
lip
piercings
and
a
matt
of
and
an
attitude
so
here
what
i
do
get
you
got
the
market
wired
unwired
kurt
said
breaking
in
for
the
tenth
time
in
as
many
minutes
alan
shot
him
a
dirty
look
unwired
right
the
kid
made
little
inverted
commas
with
his
fingertips
miming
that
is
a
very
cute
jargon
you
invented
dork
you
got
the
market
unwired
and
you
going
to
connect
up
your
network
with
the
big
interchange
down
on
front
street
well
alan
said
the
story
was
too
complicated
front
street
the
market
open
networks
it
had
no
focus
it
was
a
complete
narrative
with
a
beginning
middle
and
end
he
tried
to
explain
it
to
mimi
that
morning
over
omelets
in
his
kitchen
and
been
totally
lost
eventually
the
kid
took
on
a
look
of
intense
teenaged
skepticism
he
claimed
to
be
but
he
looked
about
and
had
been
the
puck
in
an
intense
game
of
eyeball
hockey
among
the
cute
little
punk
girls
been
volunteering
in
the
shopfront
when
he
appeared
that
the
a
citywide
network
with
eat
free
connectivity
fully
anonymized
and
hardened
against
malicious
attackers
and
incidental
environmental
interference
alan
steepled
his
fingers
and
tried
to
look
serious
and
committed
okay
that
the
goal
but
it
not
going
to
be
all
or
nothing
we
want
to
make
the
community
a
part
of
the
network
getting
people
energized
about
participating
in
the
network
is
as
important
as
providing
the
network
itself
hell
the
network
people
so
we
got
this
intermediate
step
this
way
that
everyone
can
pitch
in
and
that
is
what
renaming
your
network
to
parasitenet
kurt
nodded
vigorously
zactly
and
how
will
i
find
these
parasitenet
nodes
will
there
be
a
map
or
something
with
all
this
information
on
it
alan
nodded
slowly
we
been
thinking
about
a
mapping
application
but
we
decided
that
it
was
stupid
kurt
said
no
one
needed
to
draw
a
map
of
the
web
it
just
grew
and
people
found
its
weird
corners
on
their
own
networks
do
centralized
authority
that
just
the
chains
on
your
mind
talking
the
chains
on
my
mind
the
kid
snorted
alan
held
his
hands
up
placatingly
wait
a
second
he
said
take
a
step
back
here
and
talk
about
the
project
here
is
about
free
expression
and
cooperation
sure
it
be
nice
to
have
a
network
but
in
my
opinion
it
a
lot
more
important
to
have
a
city
full
of
people
working
on
that
network
because
they
value
expression
and
understand
how
cooperation
gets
us
more
of
that
and
we
get
this
free
expression
how
by
giving
everyone
free
internet
access
the
kid
laughed
and
shook
his
head
that
a
weird
kind
of
if
you
do
mind
my
saying
so
he
flipped
over
his
phone
i
mean
like
speech
if
you
can
afford
a
laptop
and
want
to
sit
down
and
type
on
it
i
can
build
you
a
desktop
out
of
garbage
for
twenty
bucks
kurt
said
we
drowning
in
pc
parts
sure
whatever
but
what
kind
of
free
expression
is
that
free
expression
so
long
as
you
sitting
at
home
with
your
pc
plugged
into
the
wall
well
it
not
like
we
talking
about
displacing
all
the
other
kinds
of
expression
alan
said
this
is
in
addition
to
all
the
ways
had
to
talk
right
like
this
thing
the
kid
said
he
reached
into
his
pocket
and
took
out
a
small
phone
this
was
free
not
twenty
dollars
not
even
two
thousand
dollars
just
free
from
the
phone
company
in
exchange
for
a
contract
everyone
got
one
of
these
i
went
trekking
in
india
you
see
people
using
these
out
in
the
bush
and
you
know
what
they
use
them
for
speech
not
meaning
some
kind
of
abstract
expression
but
actual
the
kid
leaned
forward
and
planted
his
hands
on
his
knees
and
suddenly
he
was
a
lot
harder
to
dismiss
as
some
intern
he
had
that
fiery
intensity
that
alan
recognized
from
himself
from
kurt
from
the
people
who
believe
alan
thought
he
was
getting
an
inkling
into
why
this
particular
intern
had
responded
to
his
press
release
not
because
he
was
too
ignorant
to
see
through
the
bullshit
but
just
the
opposite
but
that
communication
through
the
kurt
said
wonderment
in
his
voice
that
his
fellow
bohemian
could
see
how
sucktastic
that
proposition
was
how
is
that
free
speech
the
kid
rolled
his
eyes
come
off
it
you
old
people
you
turn
up
your
noses
whenever
someone
ten
years
younger
than
you
points
out
that
cell
phones
are
actually
a
pretty
good
way
for
people
to
communicate
with
each
other
even
subversively
i
wrote
a
term
paper
last
year
on
this
stuff
in
kenya
electoral
scrutineers
follow
the
ballot
boxes
from
the
polling
place
to
the
counting
house
and
use
their
cell
phones
to
sound
the
alarm
when
someone
tries
to
screw
with
them
in
the
philippines
twenty
thousand
people
were
mobilized
in
minutes
in
front
of
the
presidential
palace
when
they
tried
to
shut
down
the
broadcast
of
the
corruption
hearings
and
yet
every
time
someone
from
my
generation
talks
about
how
important
phones
are
to
democracy
there
always
some
old
pecksniff
primly
telling
us
that
our
phones
do
give
us
democracy
it
so
much
bullshit
he
fell
silent
and
they
all
stared
at
each
other
for
a
moment
mouth
hung
open
i
not
old
he
said
finally
you
older
than
me
the
kid
said
his
tone
softened
look
i
not
trying
to
be
cruel
here
but
you
the
internet
is
great
but
it
not
the
last
great
thing
we
ever
invent
my
pops
was
a
mainframe
guy
he
thought
pcs
were
toys
you
a
pc
guy
so
you
think
my
phone
is
a
toy
alan
looked
off
into
the
corner
of
the
back
room
of
kurt
shop
for
a
while
trying
to
marshal
his
thoughts
back
there
among
the
shelves
of
milk
crates
stuffed
with
and
cruft
he
had
a
thought
okay
he
said
fair
enough
it
may
be
that
today
in
the
field
there
a
lot
of
free
expression
being
enabled
with
phones
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
he
thought
of
lyman
this
is
the
we
talking
about
big
lumbering
dinosaur
that
is
thrashing
in
the
tar
pit
the
spazz
dinosaur
that
so
embarrassed
all
the
other
dinosaurs
that
none
of
them
want
to
rescue
it
back
in
the
sixties
these
guys
sued
to
keep
it
illegal
to
plug
anything
other
than
their
rental
phones
into
their
network
but
more
to
the
point
you
get
a
different
kind
of
freedom
with
an
internet
network
than
a
network
even
if
the
internet
network
lives
on
top
of
the
network
if
you
invent
a
new
way
of
using
the
phone
network
say
a
cheaper
way
of
making
calls
using
you
ca
roll
that
out
on
the
phone
network
without
the
permission
of
the
carrier
you
have
to
go
to
him
and
say
i
invented
a
way
to
kill
your
most
profitable
line
of
business
can
you
install
it
at
your
switching
stations
so
that
we
can
all
talk
long
distance
for
free
but
on
the
net
anyone
can
invent
any
application
that
he
can
get
his
buddies
to
use
no
central
authority
had
to
give
permission
for
the
web
to
exist
a
physicist
just
hacked
it
together
one
day
distributed
the
software
to
his
colleagues
and
in
just
a
very
short
while
people
all
over
the
world
had
the
web
so
the
net
can
live
on
top
of
the
phone
network
and
it
can
run
as
an
application
but
it
not
tied
to
the
phone
network
it
does
care
whose
wires
or
wireless
it
lives
on
top
of
it
got
all
these
virtues
that
are
key
to
free
expression
why
we
care
about
this
the
kid
nodded
as
he
talked
impatiently
signaling
in
body
language
that
even
alan
could
read
that
he
heard
this
already
yes
in
this
abstract
sense
there
are
a
bunch
of
things
to
like
about
your
internet
over
there
but
i
talking
about
practical
nonabstract
nontheoretical
stuff
over
here
the
real
world
i
can
get
a
phone
for
i
can
talk
to
with
it
i
can
say
i
want
i
can
use
it
sure
the
phone
company
is
a
giant
conspiracy
by
the
man
to
keep
us
down
but
can
you
really
tell
me
with
a
straight
face
that
because
i
ca
invent
the
web
for
my
phone
or
make
free
long
distance
calls
i
being
censored
of
course
not
kurt
said
alan
put
a
steadying
hand
on
his
shoulder
fine
it
not
an
thing
you
can
have
your
phones
i
can
have
my
internet
and
we
both
do
our
thing
it
not
like
the
absence
of
the
web
for
phones
or
high
charges
are
for
free
expression
christ
we
trying
to
unbreak
the
net
so
that
no
one
can
own
it
or
control
it
we
trying
to
put
it
on
every
corner
of
the
city
for
free
anonymously
for
anyone
to
use
we
doing
it
with
recycled
garbage
and
we
paying
homeless
teenagers
enough
money
to
get
off
the
street
as
part
of
the
program
what
not
to
fucking
like
the
kid
scribbled
hard
on
his
pad
you
giving
me
some
quotes
i
can
use
you
guys
need
to
work
on
your
pitch
not
to
fucking
like
that
good
he
and
link
saw
each
other
later
that
day
and
link
still
had
his
two
little
girls
with
him
sitting
on
the
patio
at
the
greek
drinking
beers
and
laughing
at
his
jokes
hey
you
the
guy
with
the
books
one
of
them
said
when
he
passed
by
he
stopped
and
nodded
that
me
all
right
he
said
link
picked
at
the
label
of
his
beer
bottle
and
added
to
the
dandruff
of
shredded
paper
in
the
ashtray
before
him
hey
abe
he
said
hey
link
he
said
he
looked
down
at
the
little
girls
bags
made
some
finds
he
said
congratulations
they
were
wearing
different
clothes
now
neon
dresses
and
shades
and
white
legs
flashing
beneath
the
tabletop
they
kicked
their
toes
and
smiled
and
drank
their
beers
which
seemed
comically
large
in
their
hands
casually
he
looked
to
see
who
was
minding
the
counter
at
the
and
saw
that
it
was
the
idiot
son
who
was
smart
enough
to
know
that
serving
liquor
to
minors
was
asking
for
bad
trouble
where
krishna
he
asked
one
girl
compressed
her
lips
into
a
thin
line
and
so
she
resolved
to
help
her
brother
because
when
it
your
fault
that
something
has
turned
to
shit
you
have
to
wash
shit
and
so
she
resolved
to
help
her
brother
which
meant
that
step
one
she
had
to
get
him
to
stop
screwing
up
he
took
off
the
girl
said
her
pancake
makeup
had
sweated
away
during
the
day
and
her
acne
was
so
bad
that
she
needed
it
he
took
off
running
like
he
forgotten
something
important
looked
scared
why
do
you
go
get
more
beers
link
said
angrily
cutting
her
off
and
alan
had
an
intuition
that
link
had
become
krishna
renfield
a
recursion
of
renfields
each
nesting
inside
the
last
like
russian
dolls
in
reverse
big
link
inside
medium
krishna
inside
the
stump
that
remained
of
darrel
and
that
meant
that
she
had
to
take
him
out
of
the
company
of
his
bad
companions
which
she
would
accomplish
through
the
simple
expedient
of
scaring
the
everlasting
fuck
out
of
them
she
sulked
off
and
the
remaining
girl
looked
down
at
her
swinging
toes
where
he
go
link
alan
said
if
krishna
was
in
a
hurry
to
go
somewhere
or
see
something
he
had
an
idea
of
what
it
was
about
link
expression
closed
up
like
a
door
slamming
shut
i
do
know
he
said
how
should
i
know
the
other
girl
scuffed
her
toes
and
took
a
sip
of
her
beer
their
gazes
all
flicked
down
to
the
bottle
the
greek
would
bar
you
for
life
if
he
knew
you
were
bringing
underaged
drinkers
into
here
alan
said
plenty
of
other
bars
in
the
market
link
said
shrugging
his
newly
broad
shoulders
elaborately
trey
was
the
kid
who
known
her
brother
since
third
grade
and
whose
brain
damage
had
turned
him
into
an
utter
turd
she
once
caught
him
going
through
the
bathroom
hamper
fetishizing
her
panties
and
she
shouted
at
him
and
he
just
ducked
and
grinned
a
grin
that
she
had
been
incapable
of
wiping
off
his
face
no
matter
how
she
raged
she
would
enjoy
this
and
they
all
know
the
greek
alan
said
three
two
one
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
began
to
walk
away
wait
link
called
the
girl
swallowed
a
giggle
he
sounded
desperate
and
not
cool
at
all
anymore
alan
stopped
and
turned
his
body
halfway
looking
impatiently
over
his
shoulder
link
mumbled
something
what
behind
kurt
place
link
said
he
said
he
was
going
to
go
look
around
behind
kurt
place
thank
you
link
he
said
he
turned
all
the
way
around
and
got
down
to
eye
level
with
the
other
girl
nice
to
meet
you
he
said
he
wanted
to
tell
her
or
or
out
while
the
but
none
of
that
seemed
likely
to
make
much
of
an
impression
on
her
she
smiled
and
her
friend
came
back
with
three
beers
you
got
a
great
house
she
said
her
friend
said
yeah
it
amazing
well
thank
you
he
said
bye
they
said
link
gaze
bored
into
the
spot
between
his
shoulder
blades
the
whole
way
to
the
end
of
the
block
the
of
kensington
were
a
maze
of
coach
houses
fences
dead
ends
and
narrow
doorways
kids
who
knew
their
secrets
played
nearly
undisturbed
by
cars
junkies
turned
them
into
reeking
pissoirs
homeless
people
dossed
down
in
the
lees
of
their
low
buildings
teenagers
came
and
necked
around
corners
but
alan
knew
their
secrets
he
seen
the
aerial
maps
and
clambered
their
length
and
breadth
and
height
with
kurt
checking
sight
lines
for
his
network
sticking
virtual
pushpins
into
the
map
on
his
screen
where
he
thought
he
could
get
some
real
benefit
out
of
an
access
point
so
once
he
reached
kensington
avenue
he
slipped
behind
a
guyanese
patty
stand
and
stepped
through
a
wooden
gate
and
began
to
make
his
way
to
the
back
of
kurt
place
cautiously
from
behind
the
riot
of
colors
and
the
ramshackle
signs
and
subculture
of
kensington
was
revealed
as
a
superfice
a
skin
stretched
over
slightly
daggy
brick
with
tiny
yards
and
tumbledown
garages
from
behind
he
could
be
walking
the
back
ways
of
any
anonymous
housing
development
a
greyzone
of
nothing
and
no
one
the
sun
went
behind
a
cloud
and
the
whole
scene
turned
into
something
monochromatic
a
clip
from
an
old
home
movie
carefully
he
proceeded
carefully
slipping
from
doorway
to
doorway
slipping
up
the
alleyway
to
the
next
to
the
corner
that
led
to
the
alley
that
led
to
kurt
carefully
listening
watching
and
he
managed
to
sneak
up
on
krishna
and
davey
and
he
knew
that
for
once
he
be
in
the
position
to
throw
the
rocks
krishna
sat
with
his
back
against
the
cinderblock
wall
near
kurt
back
door
knees
and
hands
splayed
head
down
in
a
posture
of
supplication
he
had
an
unlit
cigarette
in
his
mouth
which
he
nervously
shifted
from
corner
to
corner
like
a
soggy
toothpick
behind
him
standing
atop
the
dented
and
scabrous
garbage
cans
dumont
he
rested
his
head
on
his
folded
arms
which
he
rested
on
the
sill
and
he
stood
on
tiptoe
to
see
in
the
window
i
hungry
krishna
said
i
want
to
go
get
some
food
can
i
go
and
get
food
and
come
back
quiet
dewayne
said
not
another
fucking
word
you
sack
of
shit
he
said
it
quietly
in
a
neutral
tone
that
was
belied
by
his
words
he
settled
his
head
back
on
his
folded
forearms
like
a
babe
settling
its
head
in
a
bosom
and
looked
back
through
the
window
ah
he
said
like
he
had
taken
a
drink
krishna
climbed
slowly
to
his
feet
and
stood
off
a
pace
or
two
staring
at
drew
he
reached
into
the
pocket
of
his
old
bomber
jacket
and
found
a
lighter
and
flicked
it
nervously
a
couple
times
do
you
light
that
cigarette
davey
said
do
you
dare
how
long
are
we
going
to
be
here
krishna
whine
was
utterly
devoid
of
his
customary
swagger
what
kind
of
person
is
he
davey
said
what
kind
of
person
is
he
he
is
in
love
with
my
brother
looks
at
him
with
when
he
sees
him
hangs
on
his
words
like
a
girl
he
laughed
nastily
like
girl
like
she
looks
at
him
i
wonder
if
he
had
her
yet
do
you
think
he
has
i
do
care
krishna
said
petulantly
and
levered
himself
to
his
feet
he
began
to
pace
and
alan
hastily
backed
himself
into
the
doorway
he
been
hiding
in
she
mine
no
matter
who
she
fucking
i
her
look
at
that
darrel
said
look
at
him
talking
to
them
his
little
army
like
a
general
giving
them
a
pep
talk
he
got
that
from
my
brother
i
sure
everywhere
he
goes
he
leaves
a
trail
of
manipulators
who
run
other
people
lives
alan
stomach
clenched
in
on
itself
and
his
butt
and
thighs
ached
suddenly
like
he
been
running
hard
he
thought
about
his
with
their
shops
and
their
young
employees
learning
the
trade
from
them
as
they
learned
it
from
him
how
long
had
don
been
watching
him
when
are
we
going
to
do
it
krishna
spat
out
his
cigarette
and
shook
another
out
of
his
pack
and
stuck
it
in
his
mouth
do
light
it
drew
said
we
going
to
do
it
when
i
say
it
time
to
do
it
you
have
to
watch
first
watching
is
the
most
important
part
it
how
you
find
out
what
needs
doing
and
to
whom
it
how
you
find
out
where
you
can
do
the
most
damage
i
know
what
needs
doing
krishna
said
we
can
just
go
in
there
and
trash
the
place
and
fuck
him
up
that
suit
me
just
fine
send
the
right
message
too
danny
hopped
down
off
the
trash
can
abruptly
and
krishna
froze
in
his
paces
at
the
dry
rasp
of
hard
blackened
skin
on
the
pavement
davey
walked
toward
him
in
a
bowlegged
gait
that
was
more
a
scuttle
than
a
walk
the
motion
of
some
inhuman
creature
not
accustomed
to
two
legs
have
you
ever
watched
your
kind
ever
do
you
understand
them
even
a
little
just
because
you
managed
to
get
a
little
power
over
one
of
my
people
you
think
you
understand
it
all
you
do
that
one
in
there
is
to
my
brother
if
you
vandalized
his
little
shop
he
just
go
to
my
brother
for
protection
and
end
up
more
loyal
and
more
please
stop
thinking
you
know
anything
it
make
it
much
easier
for
us
to
get
along
krishna
stiffened
i
know
things
he
said
your
pathetic
little
birdie
girl
is
davey
said
he
stumped
over
to
krishna
stood
almost
on
his
toes
looking
up
at
him
krishna
took
an
involuntary
step
backward
a
little
a
changeling
without
clan
or
magic
of
any
kind
krishna
stuck
his
balled
fists
into
the
pockets
of
his
jacket
i
know
something
about
he
said
about
kind
oh
yes
davey
tone
was
low
dangerous
i
know
how
to
recognize
you
even
when
you
passing
for
normal
i
know
how
to
spot
you
in
a
crowd
in
a
second
he
smiled
you
been
watching
my
kind
all
your
life
but
i
been
watching
your
kind
for
all
of
i
seen
you
on
the
subway
and
running
corner
stores
teaching
in
classrooms
and
driving
to
work
davey
smiled
then
showing
blackened
stumps
yes
you
can
you
certainly
can
he
reached
out
one
small
delicate
hand
and
stroked
the
inside
of
krishna
wrist
you
very
clever
that
way
you
are
krishna
closed
his
eyes
and
breathed
heavily
through
his
nose
as
though
in
pain
or
ecstasy
that
a
good
skill
to
have
they
stood
there
for
a
moment
while
davey
slowly
trailed
his
fingertips
over
krishna
wrist
then
abruptly
he
grabbed
krishna
thumb
and
wrenched
it
far
back
krishna
dropped
abruptly
to
his
knees
squeaking
in
pain
you
can
spot
my
kind
but
you
know
nothing
about
us
you
nothing
do
you
understand
me
krishna
nodded
slowly
alan
felt
a
sympathetic
ache
in
his
thumb
and
a
sympathetic
grin
on
his
face
at
the
sight
of
krishna
knelt
down
and
made
to
acquiesce
you
understand
me
krishna
nodded
again
davey
released
him
and
he
climbed
slowly
to
his
feet
davey
took
his
wrist
again
gently
let
get
you
something
to
eat
he
said
before
alan
knew
it
they
were
nearly
upon
him
walking
back
down
the
alley
straight
toward
his
hiding
place
blood
roared
in
his
ears
and
he
pressed
his
back
up
against
the
doorway
they
were
only
a
step
or
two
away
and
after
a
couple
of
indiscreetly
loud
panting
gasps
he
clamped
his
lips
shut
and
held
his
breath
there
was
no
way
they
could
miss
him
he
pressed
his
back
harder
against
the
door
and
it
abruptly
swung
open
and
a
cold
hand
wrapped
itself
around
his
bicep
and
pulled
his
through
into
a
darkened
and
garage
he
tripped
over
his
own
heel
and
started
to
go
over
but
a
pair
of
hands
caught
him
and
settled
him
gently
to
the
floor
quiet
came
a
hoarse
whisper
in
a
voice
he
could
not
place
and
then
he
knew
who
his
rescuer
was
he
stood
up
silently
and
gave
billy
a
long
hug
he
was
as
skinny
as
death
trey
phone
number
was
still
current
in
the
video
database
so
she
called
him
hey
trey
she
said
it
lara
lara
heeeeeeyyyy
he
said
in
a
tone
that
left
no
doubt
that
he
was
picturing
her
panties
sorry
your
bro
ai
here
want
to
take
me
out
to
dinner
tonight
the
silence
on
the
other
end
of
the
line
made
her
want
to
laugh
but
she
bit
her
lip
and
rolled
her
eyes
and
amused
the
girl
browsing
the
epics
and
visibly
eavesdropping
trey
lara
uh
yes
i
love
to
sure
is
this
like
a
group
thing
or
no
trey
i
thought
i
keep
this
between
the
two
of
us
be
at
the
store
until
six
meet
me
here
yeah
okay
okay
sure
i
see
you
tonight
brad
was
so
thin
he
looked
like
a
corpse
he
was
still
tall
though
and
his
hair
and
beard
were
grown
out
into
long
straggles
of
knot
and
grime
in
the
of
the
garage
he
had
the
instantly
identifiable
silhouette
of
a
street
person
he
gathered
adam
up
in
a
hug
that
reeked
of
piss
and
booze
a
hug
like
a
bundle
of
twigs
in
his
arms
i
love
you
he
whispered
andrew
backed
away
and
held
him
at
arm
length
his
skin
had
gone
to
deep
creases
lined
with
soot
his
eyes
filmed
with
something
that
looked
like
pond
scum
brady
what
are
you
doing
here
he
held
a
finger
up
to
his
lips
then
opened
the
door
again
onto
the
alley
alan
peered
the
way
that
davey
and
krishna
had
gone
just
in
time
to
see
them
turn
a
distant
corner
give
it
another
minute
blake
said
drawing
the
door
nearly
closed
again
a
moment
later
they
heard
another
door
open
and
then
boots
jangled
past
headed
the
other
way
they
listened
to
them
recede
and
then
brian
swung
the
door
wide
again
it
okay
now
he
said
they
stepped
out
into
the
sunlight
and
bert
started
to
walk
slowly
away
alan
caught
up
with
him
and
bert
took
his
arm
with
long
bony
fingers
leaning
on
him
he
had
a
slight
limp
where
have
you
been
alan
asked
when
they
had
gone
halfway
home
through
deft
confident
turnings
led
by
blake
watching
you
he
said
of
course
when
i
came
to
the
city
i
worked
out
at
the
racetrack
for
a
week
and
made
enough
money
to
live
off
of
for
a
couple
months
and
avoided
the
tough
guys
who
watched
me
winning
and
waited
to
catch
me
alone
at
the
streetcar
stop
i
made
enough
and
then
i
went
to
watch
you
i
knew
where
you
were
of
course
always
knew
where
you
were
i
could
see
you
whenever
i
closed
my
eyes
i
knew
when
you
opened
your
shops
and
i
went
by
at
night
and
in
the
busy
parts
of
the
day
so
that
i
could
get
a
better
sense
of
them
i
kept
an
eye
on
you
alan
watched
over
you
i
had
to
get
close
enough
to
smell
you
and
hear
you
and
see
you
though
it
was
enough
to
see
you
in
my
mind
because
i
had
to
know
the
i
could
see
the
but
i
had
to
know
the
why
were
you
opening
your
stores
why
were
you
saying
the
things
you
said
i
had
to
get
close
enough
because
from
the
outside
it
impossible
to
tell
if
you
winking
because
you
got
a
secret
or
if
you
got
dust
in
your
eye
or
if
you
making
fun
of
someone
who
winking
or
if
you
trying
out
a
wink
to
see
how
it
might
feel
later
it
been
four
years
i
been
watching
you
when
i
could
going
back
to
the
track
for
more
when
i
ran
out
of
money

alvin
nodded

know
any
more
about
the
world
than
i
do
albert
nodded
yeah
he
said
billy
shook
his
head
and
leaned
more
heavily
on
alan
arm
i
want
a
drink
he
said
i
got
some
vodka
in
the
freezer
alan
said
i
take
some
of
the
irish
whiskey
on
the
sideboard
in
the
living
room
adam
looked
at
him
sharply
and
he
shrugged
and
smiled
an
apologetic
smile
i
been
watching
he
said
they
crossed
the
park
together
and
buddy
stopped
to
look
hard
at
the
fountain
that
where
he
took
edward
right
i

alvin

lost
a
couple
toes
last
year
to
frostbite
and
never
got
them
looked
at
properly
he
reeked
of
piss
and
booze
they
did
grow
back
bradley
shook
his
head
they
did
he
said
not
mine
hello
krishna
he
said
alan
looked
to
his
neighbors
porch
krishna
stood
there
stock
still
against
the
wall
friend
of
yours
huh
krishna
said
boyfriend
he
offered
me
a
bottle
of
wine
if
i
let
him
take
me
home
bradley
said
best
offer
i
had
all
week
wan
na

threesome
an
you
ma
twat
krishna
contorted
his
face
into
an
elaborate
sneer
puke
he
said
bye
krishna
buddy
said
alan
put
his
key
into
the
lock
and
let
them
in
blaine
made
a
hobbling
beeline
for
the
sideboard
and
picked
up
the
jim
beam
apollo
commemorative
decanter
that
adam
kept
full
of
bushmills
and
poured
himself
a
tall
glass
of
it
he
drank
it
back
in
two
swallows
then
rolled
his
tongue
around
in
his
mouth
with
his
eyes
closed
while
he
breathed
out
the
fumes
i
have
been
thinking
about
that
bottle
ever
since
you
bought
it
he
said
this
stuff
is
legendary
god
that
good
i
mean
that
fucking
magical
it
good
andrew
said
you
can
have
more
if
you
want
yeah
burke
said
and
poured
out
another
drink
he
carried
it
and
the
decanter
to
the
sofa
and
settled
into
it
nice
sofa
he
said
nice
living
room
nice
house
not
very
normal
though
no
andrew
said
i
not
fitting
in
very
well
i
fit
in
great
he
drank
back
another
glug
of
whiskey
and
poured
out
another
twenty
dollars
worth
just
great
it
the
truth
i
totally
invisible
and
indistinguishable
i
been
sleeping
at
the
scott
mission
for
six
months
now
and
no
one
has
given
me
a
second
glance
they
even
steal
my
stuff
because
when
they
try
when
they
come
for
my
shoes
or
my
food
in
the
night
i
always
awake
and
watching
them
and
just
shaking
my
head
the
whole
living
room
stank
of
whiskey
fumes
with
an
ammoniac
tinge
what
if
i
find
you
some
clothes
and
a
towel
would
i
clean
myself
up
would
i
get
rid
of
this
protective
coloration
and
become
visible
again
he
drank
more
breathed
out
the
fumes
sure
why
not
why
not
time
to
be
visible
you
seen
me
krishna
seen
me
davey
gon
na
see
me
least
i
got
to
see
them
first
and
so
he
let
his
older
brother
lead
him
by
the
hand
upstairs
to
the
bathroom
with
its
paperbacks
and
framed
cartoons
and
so
he
let
his
brother
put
him
under
the
stinging
hot
shower
and
shampoo
his
hair
and
scrub
him
vigorously
with
a
back
brush
sluicing
off
the
grime
of
the
streets
though
the
calous
pads
on
his
hands
remained
as
dark
with
soot
as
the
feet
of
an
alleycat
and
so
he
let
his
older
brother
wash
the
stumps
of
his
toes
where
the
skin
was
just
a
waxy
pucker
of
scar
like
belly
buttons
which
neither
of
them
had
and
so
he
let
his
brother
trim
away
his
beard
first
with
scissors
and
then
with
an
electric
razor
and
so
he
let
his
brother
brush
out
his
long
hair
and
tie
it
back
with
an
elastic
taken
from
around
a
bunch
of
broccoli
in
the
vegetable
crisper
and
so
by
the
time
the
work
was
done
and
he
was
dressed
in
clothes
that
hung
over
his
sunken
chest
and
spindly
legs
like
a
tent
he
was
quite
sober
and
quite
clean
and
quite
different
you
look
fine
adam
said
as
brent
fingered
his
chin
and
watched
the
reflection
in
the
mirror
on
the
door
of
alan
study
you
look
great
i
look
conspicuous
visible
used
to
be
that
eyes
just
slid
off
of
me
now
they
come
to
rest
on
me
if
only
for
a
few
seconds
andy
nodded
sure
that
right
you
know
being
invisible
is
the
same
as
being
normal
normal
people
are
visible
yeah
brad
said
nodding
miserably
he
pawed
again
at
the
smooth
hollows
of
his
cheeks
you
can
stay
in
here
alan
said
gesturing
at
his
study
the
desk
and
his
laptop
and
his
little
beginning
of
a
story
sat
in
the
middle
of
the
room
surrounded
by
a
litter
of
access
points
in
various
stages
of
repair
and
printed
literature
full
of
optimistic
nontechnical
explanations
of
parasitenet
i
move
all
that
stuff
out
yeah
billy
said
you
should
just
put
it
in
the
basement
in
boxes
i
been
watching
you
screw
around
with
that
wireless
stuff
and
you
know
it
not
real
normal
either
it
pretty
desperately
weird
danny
right
that
kurt
guy
following
you
around
like
in
love
with
you
that
not
normal
he
flushed
and
his
hands
were
in
fists
christ
adam
you
living
in
this
goddamned
museum
and
nailing
those
stupid
projects
to
the
sides
of
buildings
you
got
this
comet
tail
of
druggy
kids
following
you
around
buying
dope
with
the
money
they
make
off
of
the
work
they
do
for
you
you
not
just
visible
you
and
you
so
weird
even
get
the
crawlies
around
you
his
bare
feet
slapped
the
shining
cool
wood
as
he
paced
the
room
lame
foot
making
a
different
sound
from
the
good
one
andy
looked
out
the
window
at
the
green
rattling
in
the
wind
they
buying
drugs
benny
snorted
you
bankrolling
weekly
heroin
parties
at
two
warehouses
on
oxford
and
three
raves
a
month
down
on
liberty
street
he
looked
up
at
the
ceiling
mimi
awake
now
he
said
better
introduce
me
mimi
kept
her
own
schedule
mostly
nocturnal
padding
quietly
around
his
house
while
he
slept
coming
silently
to
bed
after
he
rose
while
he
was
in
the
bathroom
she
had
spoken
a
word
to
him
in
more
than
a
week
and
he
had
said
nothing
to
her
but
for
the
snores
and
the
warmth
of
the
bed
when
he
lay
down
and
the
morning
dishes
in
the
sink
she
might
not
have
been
living
with
him
at
all
but
for
his
constant
awareness
of
her
presence
in
his
house
and
but
for
the
shirts
with
backs
in
the
laundry
hamper
he
might
be
living
all
on
his
own
but
for
the
knife
that
he
found
under
the
mattress
compass
set
into
the
handle
serrated
edge
glinting
he
might
have
forgotten
those
wings
which
drooped
near
to
the
floor
now
footsteps
crossing
between
the
master
bedroom
and
the
bathroom
pausing
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
a
soft
cough
alan
it
okay
mimi
he
said
she
came
down
in
a
pair
of
his
boxer
shorts
with
the
topsheet
complicatedly
draped
over
her
chest
in
a
way
that
left
her
wings
free
their
tips
touched
the
ground
this
is
my
brother
bentley
adam
said
i
told
you
about
him
you
can
see
the
future
she
said
reproachfully
you
have
wings
he
said
she
held
out
her
hand
and
he
shook
it
i
want
breakfast
she
said
sounds
good
to
me
brent
said
alan
nodded
i
cook
he
made
pancakes
and
cut
up
pears
and
peaches
and
apples
and
bananas
for
fruit
salad
this
reminds
me
of
the
pancake
house
in
town
bart
said

adam
nodded
it
had
been
favorite
sunday
dinner
place
do
you
live
here

mimi
said
alan
said
yes
she
slipped
her
hand
into
his
and
squeezed
his
thumb
it
felt
good
and
unexpected
are
you
going
to
tell
her
billy
said
she
withdrew
her
hand
what
is
it
her
voice
was
cold
billy
said
there
no
good
comes
of
keeping
secrets
krishna
and
davey
are
planning
to
attack
kurt
krishna
says
he
owns
you
he
probably
come
for
you
did
you
see
that
adam
said
him
coming
for
her
not
that
kind
of
seeing
i
just
understand
enough
about
people
to
know
what
that
means
trey
met
her
at
six
and
he
was
paunchier
than
she
remembered
his
high
school
brawn
run
to
a
little
fat
he
shoved
a
gift
into
her
hand
a
brown
paper
bag
with
a
quart
of
cheap
vodka
in
it
she
thanked
him
simperingly
and
tucked
it
in
her
knapsack
it
a
nice
night
let
get
takeout
and
eat
it
in
high
park
she
saw
the
wheels
turn
in
his
head
meal
plus
booze
plus
secluded
park
equals
pussy
pussy
pussy
and
she
let
the
tip
of
her
tongue
touch
her
lips
this
would
be
even
easier
than
thought
how
can
you
tell
the
difference
arthur
said
between
seeing
and
understanding
you
never
mistake
them
seeing
it
is
like
remembering
spying
on
someone
only
you
have
spied
on
him
yet
like
you
were
standing
behind
him
and
he
just
did
notice
you
hear
it
you
smell
it
you
see
it
like
you
were
standing
him
sometimes
like
it
happened
to
you
understanding
that
totally
different
that
like
a
little
voice
in
your
head
explaining
it
to
you
telling
you
what
it
all
means
oh
andy
said
you
thought
you
seen
right
yeah
thought
that
i
was
running
out
of
time
and
going
to
die
or
kill
davey
again
or
something
it
was
a
feeling
though
not
like
being
there
not
like
having
anything
explained
is
that
going
to
happen
mimi
asked
brad
brad
looked
down
at
the
table
unclear
ask
again
later
that
what
this
magic
i
bought
in
a
store
once
used
to
say
does
that
mean
you
do
know
i
think
it
means
i
do
want
to
know
do
worry
bert
said
kurt
safe
tonight
alan
stopped
lacing
up
his
shoes
and
slumped
back
on
the
bench
in
his
foyer
mimi
had
done
the
dishes
bill
had
dried
and
he
fretted
about
kurt
but
it
was
until
he
could
take
it
anymore
and
was
ready
to
go
and
find
him
bring
him
home
if
necessary
that
billy
had
come
to
talk
to
him
do
you
know
that
for
sure
yes
he
has
dinner
with
a
woman
then
he
takes
her
dumpster
diving
and
comes
home
and
goes
to
bed
i
can
see
that
but
you
do
see
everything
no
but
i
saw
that
fine
adam
said
he
felt
hopeless
in
the
face
of
these
predictions
as
though
the
future
were
something
set
and
immutable
i
need
to
use
the
bathroom
billy
said
and
made
his
way
upstairs
while
alan
moved
to
a
sofa
and
paged
absently
through
an
old
edition
of
in
whose
marbled
frontispiece
had
come
detached
a
moment
later
mimi
joined
him
sitting
down
next
to
him
her
wings
unfolded
across
the
sofa
back
how
big
are
they
going
to
get
do
you
think
she
said
arranging
them
you
do
know
they
bigger
than
they
ever
been
that
was
good
food
she
said
i
think
i
should
go
talk
to
krishna
adam
shook
his
head
whoa

do
need
to
be
in
between
us
maybe
i
can
get
him
to
back
off
on
you
on
your
family
mimi
i
do
even
want
to
discuss
it
it
the
right
thing
to
do
she
said
it
not
fair
to
you
to
stay
you
want
to
have
your
wings
cut
alan
said
that
why
you
want
to
go
back
to
him
she
shied
back
as
though
he
slapped
her
no
you
do
but
what
billy
did
tell
you
is
that
krishna
out
there
with
other
women
i
saw
him
today
with
a
girl
young
pretty
normal
if
he
takes
you
back
it
will
be
as
a
toy
not
as
a
lover
he
ca
love
christ
she
said
why
are
you
saying
this
because
i
do
want
to
watch
you
mimi
stay
here
sort
out
krishna
together
and
my
brother
billy
here
now
that
means
they
ca
sneak
up
on
us
and
these
she
said
flapping
her
wings
one
great
heave
that
sent
currents
of
air
across
the
room
that
blew
the
loose
frontispiece
from
in
toward
the
fireplace
grate
you
sort
these
out
too
what
do
you
want
from
me
mimi
he
was
angry
now
she
had
spoken
a
word
to
him
in
weeks
and
now
cut
them
off
alan
make
me
into
someone
who
can
go
out
again
who
can
be
seen
do
it
i
have
the
knife
adam
squeezed
his
eyes
shut
no
he
said
she
said
and
stood
headed
for
the
stairs
upstairs
the
toilet
flushed
and
they
heard
the
sink
running
wait
he
said
running
after
her
she
had
her
hand
on
the
doorknob
no
she
said
she
was
crying
now
i
wo
stay
i
wo
be
trapped
again
better
to
be
with
him
than
trapped
i
do
it
he
said
if
you
still
want
me
to
do
it
in
two
days
do
it
she
looked
gravely
at
him
do
you
lie
to
me
about
this
she
said
do
you
dare
be
lying
he
took
her
hands
i
swear
he
said
from
the
top
of
the
stairs
then
whups
said
billy
i
think
i
just
tuck
myself
into
bed
mimi
smiled
and
hugged
alan
fiercely
trey
ardor
came
out
with
his
drunkenness
first
a
clammy
arm
around
her
shoulder
then
a
casual
grope
at
her
boob
then
a
sloppy
kiss
on
the
corner
of
her
mouth
that
was
as
far
as
she
was
going
to
let
it
go
she
waited
for
him
to
move
in
for
another
kiss
then
slipped
out
from
under
his
arm
so
that
he
fell
into
the
roots
of
the
big
tree
they
been
leaning
against
she
brained
him
with
the
vodka
bottle
before
he
had
a
chance
to
recover
then
as
he
rocked
and
moaned
she
calmly
took
the
hunting
knife
she
bought
at
the
yonge
street
survivalist
store
out
of
her
bag
she
prized
one
of
his
hands
off
his
clutched
head
and
turned
it
over
then
swiftly
drew
the
blade
across
his
palm
laying
it
open
to
the
muscle
she
had
been
sure
that
she
be
capable
of
doing
that
but
it
was
easier
than
she
thought
she
had
nothing
to
worry
about
she
was
capable
of
that
and
more
they
climbed
into
bed
together
at
the
same
time
for
the
first
time
since
they
come
home
like
a
domesticated
couple
and
mimi
dug
under
her
pillow
and
set
something
down
with
a
tin
on
the
bedstand
a
sound
too
tinny
to
be
the
hunting
knife
alan
squinted
it
was
the
robot
the
one
he
given
her
the
pretty
thing
with
the
dutch
master
craquelure
up
its
skirts
he
beautiful
she
said
like
you
she
wrapped
her
wings
around
him
tightly
soft
fur
softer
than
any
down
comforter
and
pressed
her
dimpled
knees
into
the
hollows
of
his
legs
snuggling
in
he
cried
like
a
baby
once
the
pain
in
his
hand
set
in
she
pointed
the
knifepoint
at
his
face
close
enough
to
stab
him
if
need
be
i
wo
kill
you
if
you
do
scream
she
said
but
i
will
be
taking
one
joint
of
one
toe
and
one
joint
of
one
finger
tonight
just
so
you
know
he
tried
not
to
fall
asleep
tried
to
stay
awake
and
savor
that
feeling
of
her
pressed
against
him
of
her
breath
on
the
nape
of
his
neck
of
the
enfolded
engulfment
of
her
wings
but
he
could
keep
his
eyes
open
soon
enough
he
was
asleep
what
roused
him
he
could
say
but
he
found
himself
groggily
awake
in
the
close
heat
of
those
wings
held
tight
he
listened
attentively
heard
something
else
a
tinny
sound
the
robot
his
bladder
was
full
he
gently
extricated
himself
from
mimi
from
her
wings
and
stood
there
was
the
robot
silhouetted
on
the
end
table
he
smiled
and
padded
off
to
the
toilet
he
came
back
to
find
mimi
splayed
across
the
whole
bed
occupying
its
length
and
breadth
a
faintly
naughty
smile
on
her
face
he
began
to
ease
himself
into
bed
again
when
he
heard
the
sound
tinny
a
little
rattle
he
looked
at
the
robot
it
was
moving
its
arms
were
moving
that
was
impossible
its
arms
were
painted
on
he
sat
up
quickly
rousing
mimi
who
let
out
a
small
sound
and
something
small
and
bent
emerged
from
behind
the
robot
and
made
a
dash
for
the
edge
of
the
end
table
the
way
the
thing
ran
it
reminded
him
of
an
animal
that
had
been
crippled
by
a
trap
he
shrank
back
from
it
instinctively
even
as
he
reached
out
for
the
table
light
and
switched
it
on
mimi
scrunched
her
eyelids
and
flung
an
arm
over
her
face
but
he
hardly
noticed
even
when
she
gave
an
outraged
groan
he
was
looking
at
the
little
crippled
thing
struggling
to
get
down
off
the
end
table
on
mimi
side
of
the
bed
it
was
the
allen
though
he
had
seen
it
in
nearly
years
he
recognized
it
tiny
malformed
and
it
was
still
the
spitting
image
of
him
had
davey
been
holding
on
to
it
all
these
years
tending
it
in
a
cage
torturing
it
with
pins
mimi
groaned
again
switch
off
the
light
baby
she
said
a
domesticity
in
a
sec
he
said
and
edged
closer
to
the
allen
which
was
huddled
in
on
itself
staring
and
crazy
shhh
adam
breathed
it
okay
he
very
slowly
moved
one
hand
toward
the
end
table
leaning
over
mimi
kneeing
her
wing
out
of
the
way
the
allen
shied
back
farther
what
you
doing
mimi
said
squinting
up
at
him
be
very
still
he
said
to
her
i
do
want
to
frighten
it
scream
or
make
any
sudden
movements
i
counting
on
you
her
eyes
grew
round
and
she
slowly
looked
over
toward
the
end
table
she
sucked
in
sudden
air
but
did
scream
what
is
it
me
he
said
it
grew
out
of
a
piece
of
me
my
thumb
after
davey
bit
it
off
jesus
she
said
the
allen
was
quaking
now
and
alan
cooed
to
it
it
hurt
mimi
said
a
long
time
ago
andreas
said
no
now
it
bleeding
she
was
right
a
small
bead
of
blood
had
formed
beneath
it
he
extended
his
hand
farther
its
bandy
scurry
was
pathetic
holding
his
breath
alan
lifted
the
allen
gently
cradling
it
in
his
palms
it
squirmed
and
thrashed
weakly
shh
he
said
again
his
hands
were
instantly
made
slippery
and
sticky
with
its
blood
shh
something
sharp
pricked
at
his
hand
now
that
he
had
it
up
close
he
could
see
where
the
blood
was
coming
from
a
sewing
needle
shoved
rudely
through
its
distended
abdomen
cover
up
bradley
said
i
coming
up
they
heard
his
lopsided
tread
on
the
steps
mimi
pulled
the
blanket
up
around
her
chin
okay
she
said
bert
opened
the
door
quickly
he
wore
nothing
but
the
oversized
jeans
that
alan
had
given
him
his
scrawny
chest
and
mutilated
feet
bare
it
going
to
die
brad
said
hunkering
down
beside
the
bed
davey
pinned
it
and
then
sent
link
over
with
it
it
ca
last
through
the
night
adam
felt
like
he
was
choking
we
can
help
it
he
said
it
can
heal
it
healed
before
it
wo
this
time
see
how
much
pain
it
in
it
out
of
its
mind
so
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
we
need
to
put
it
out
of
its
misery
brad
said
it
the
right
thing
in
his
hands
the
thing
squirmed
and
made
a
small
hurt
sound
shhh
alan
said
the
sound
it
made
was
like
sobbing
but
small
so
small
and
weak
mimi
said
i
think
i
going
to
be
sick
yeah
brian
said
yeah
i
can
see
that
she
lifted
herself
out
of
bed
unmindful
of
her
nudity
and
pushed
her
way
past
him
to
the
door
to
the
bathroom
stop
being
such
a
baby
she
told
trey
as
he
clutched
at
his
foot
it
almost
stopped
bleeding
already
he
looked
up
at
her
with
murder
in
his
eyes
shall
i
take
another
one
she
said
he
looked
away
if
i
get
word
that
you
come
within
a
mile
of
my
brother
i
will
come
back
and
take
your
eyes
the
toe
and
the
finger
joint
were
just
a
down
payment
on
that
he
made
a
sullen
sound
so
she
took
his
vain
and
girlish
blond
hair
in
her
fist
and
tugged
his
head
back
and
kissed
his
throat
with
the
knife
nod
if
you
understand
slowly
the
knife
is
under
mimi
pillow
i
ca
do
it
alan
said
i
know
brian
said
i
will
and
he
did
took
the
knife
took
the
allen
it
cried
mimi
threw
up
in
another
room
the
sound
more
felt
than
heard
the
toilet
flushed
and
brian
hands
were
sure
and
swift
but
not
sure
enough
the
allen
made
a
sound
like
a
dog
whistle
bruce
hand
moved
again
and
then
it
was
over
he
dug
a
sock
out
of
the
hamper
and
rolled
up
the
allen
remains
in
it
i
bury
it
he
said
in
the
back
numbly
alan
stood
and
began
dressing
no
he
said
i
will
mimi
joined
them
wrapped
in
a
blanket
alan
dug
and
brent
held
the
sock
and
mimi
watched
solemnly
a
trapezoid
of
light
knifed
across
the
back
garden
they
looked
up
and
saw
krishna
staring
down
at
them
from
a
window
he
was
smiling
very
slightly
a
moment
later
link
appeared
in
the
window
reeling
like
he
was
drunk
giggling
they
all
looked
at
one
another
for
a
frozen
moment
then
alan
turned
back
to
his
shoveling
he
dug
down
three
feet
and
brent
laid
the
little
allen
down
in
the
earth
gently
as
putting
it
to
bed
and
alan
filled
the
hole
back
up
mimi
looked
back
up
at
the
window
eyes
locked
on
krishna
i
going
inside
adam
announced
are
you
coming
yeah
mimi
said
but
she
did
she
stayed
out
there
for
ten
minutes
then
twenty
and
when
alan
looked
out
his
window
at
her
he
saw
she
was
still
staring
up
at
krishna
mesmerized
he
loudly
opened
his
window
and
leaned
out
mimi
eyes
flicked
to
him
and
then
she
slowly
made
her
way
back
into
the
house
she
took
his
pants
and
his
shoes
and
left
him
in
the
park
crying
and
drunk
all
things
considered
it
had
gone
well
when
trey
told
her
that
he
had
no
idea
where
her
brother
was
she
believed
him
it
was
okay
she
find
her
brother
he
had
lots
of
friends
alan
thought
that
that
was
the
end
of
the
story
maybe
short
and
sweet
a
kind
of
lady
or
the
tiger
thing
let
the
reader
imagination
do
the
rest
there
on
the
screen
it
seemed
awfully
thin
here
in
the
house
built
for
it
it
seemed
awfully
unimportant
such
a
big
and
elaborate
envelope
for
such
a
small
thing
he
saved
the
file
and
went
back
up
to
bed
mimi
was
asleep
which
was
good
because
he
did
think
he
be
able
to
fall
asleep
with
her
twice
that
night
he
curled
up
on
his
side
of
the
bed
and
closed
his
eyes
and
tried
to
forget
the
sound
the
allen
had
made
what
is
wrong
with
you
not
a
thing
she
said
her
brother
had
been
unexpected
you
fucking
insane
maybe
she
said
what
do
you
from
i
want
you
to
behave
yourself
you
completely
fucking
insane
he
woke
to
find
billy
gone
and
had
a
momentary
panic
a
flashback
to
the
day
that
fred
had
gone
missing
in
the
night
but
then
he
found
a
note
on
the
kitchen
table
terse
gone
out
b
the
handwriting
sent
him
back
through
the
years
to
the
days
before
davey
came
home
the
days
when
they
been
a
family
when
he
signed
brad
report
cards
and
hugged
him
when
he
came
home
with
a
paper
mimi
came
down
while
he
was
holding
the
note
staring
at
the
few
spare
words
there
she
was
draped
in
her
wings
where
did
he
go
i
do
know
alan
said
out
is
this
what
your
family
is
like
yeah
alan
said
this
is
what
they
like
are
you
going
to
go
out
too
yeah
fine
she
said
she
was
angry
she
stomped
out
of
the
kitchen
and
stepped
on
her
own
wing
tripping
going
over
on
her
face
tomorrow
you
cut
these
tomorrow
she
said
and
her
wings
flared
open
knocking
the
light
fixtures
and
tumbling
piles
of
books
tomorrow
she
said
good
morning
natalie
he
said
she
was
and
her
face
was
puffy
and
her
hand
shook
so
that
the
smoke
from
her
cigarette
rose
in
a

she
said
nodding
he
looked
at

across
the
railing
that
divided
their
porches

of
cutoffs
and
house
slippers
and
a
shapeless
green
that
hung
down
past
her
butt

said
he
was
hardly

the
basement

he
said
she
shook
her
head
her
shoulders
were
tensed
her
whole
skinny
body
a
cringe
we
go
barefoot
and
sit
on
the
patio
he
said
after
a
moment
kicking
his
shoes
off
she
looked
at
him
and
gave
a
sad
laugh
okay
the
sidewalk
was
still
cool
enough
for
bare
feet
the
greek
did
give
their
bare
feet
a
second
look
but
brought
iced
coffees
and
yogurt
with
walnuts
and
honey
do
you
want

said
here
he
reached
for
a
clean
napkin
from
the
next
table
and
handed
it
to
her
she
dried
her
eyes
and
wiped
her
nose
and
ate
a
spoonful
of
yogurt
drink
he
said
and
handed
her
the
coffee
she
drank
they
brought

andrew
said
surprising
himself

new
apartment

month
she
set
her
cup
down
carefully
no
she
said
i
serious
it
a
bad
situation
that
you
ca
improve
and
the
more
you
stay
there
the
worse
it
going
to
get

not
a
practical
suggestion
staying
there
in
potential
danger
is
not
practical
you
need
to
get
out
staying
there
will
only
make
things
worse
for
you
she
clenched
her
jaw
you
know
there
comes
a
point
where
you
not
giving
advice
anymore
there
comes
a
point
where
you
just
moralizing
demonstrating
your
hypothetical
superiority
when
it
comes
to
doing
the
right
thing
that
not
very
fucking
helpful
you
know
i
holding
my
shit
together
right
now
and
rather
than
telling
me
that
it
not
enough
you
could
try
to
help
me
with
the
stuff
i
capable
of
alan
digested
this
she
said
it
loudly
and
a
few
of
the
other
morning
patrons
at
the
greek
were
staring
at
them
he
looked
away
across
the
street
and
spied
billy
standing
in
a
doorway
watching
billy
met
his
eyes
then
looked
away
i
sorry

he
said

she
blew
air
out
her
nostrils
what

this

can
knock
on
my
door
any
time
i
make
up
the
sofa
for

he
thought
of
mimi
and
cringed
inwardly
she
have
to
stay
upstairs
and
be
quiet
if
there
were
strangers
in
the
house
then
he
remembered
his
promise
about
her
wings
he
bit
his
lip
she
let
out
a
harsh
chuckle
will
i
be
any
safer
there
what
does
that
mean
you
the
weirdest
person
i
ever
met
alvin
i
mean
sorry
no
offense
but
why
the
hell
would
i
knock
on
your
door
she
stood
and
turned
on
her
barefoot
heel
and
took
herself
away
walking
at
a
brisk
and
gingerly
pace
barry
moseyed
over
and
sat
in
her
seat
she
be
okay
he
said
he
picked
up
her
spoon
and
began
to
finish
her
breakfast

closed
his
eyes

very
pretty
barry
said

so
kurt
awake
yeah

him
i

it
for
your
own
good
you
know
she
could
bring
herself
to
say
the
words
for
the
enormity
of
what
she
done
was
overwhelming
her
she
found
three
of
his
friends
and
treated
each
of
them
to
an
evening
of
terror
and
hurt
and
none
of
them
would
tell
her
where
her
brother
was
none
of
them
knew
maybe
they
been
innocent
all
along
where

you
far
from

he
said
in
the
background
she
heard
a
girl
crying
it
going
to
happen
we
going
to
cover
the
whole
market
kurt
said
he
had
the
latest
coverage
map
out
and
it
looked
like
he
was
right
look
at
this
the
overlapping
rings
of
wifi
over
the
map
were
nearly
total
are
those
our
own
nodes
or
just
friendlies
alan
asked
all
his
confusion
and
worry
forgotten
at
the
sight
of
the
map
those
are
our
own
kurt
said
not
so
many
friendlies
he
tapped
a
key
and
showed
a
map
of
the
city
with
a
pitiful
sprinkling
of
fellow
travelers
who
opened
up
their
networks
and
renamed
them
parasitenet

more
buddy
said
kurt
looked
a
question
at
alan
my
brother
brent
he
said

kurt
they
shook
your
brother
adam
nodded
not
one
of
the
missing
ones
he
shook
his
head
a
different
one
it
nice
to
meet
you
kurt
wiped
off
his
palms
adam
looked
around
the
little
private
nest
at
the
back
of
the
shop
at
the
small
window
on
the
back
wall
danny
watched
at
that
window
sometimes
i
gon

screengrab
of

to

he
bust
a
nut
it
made
anton
smile
lyman
and
kurt
were
the
unlikeliest
of
pals
but
pals
they
were

that
why

anton
smiled
shyly
no
volunteers
today
kurt
shrugged
a
jingle
of
chains

thinking
of

a
movie

wan

brett

oblivious
to
the
fact
that

kurt
said
great
gim
me
an
hour
or
so
and
meet
me
out
front
it
a
date
he
was
half
a
block
from
home
when
he
spotted
natalie
sitting
on
her
porch
staring
at
the
park
kurt
and
link
were
gone
the
patio
at
the
greek
was
full
he
was
stood
in
his
bare
feet
in
the
middle
of
kensington
market
on
a
busy
shopping
day
and
he
had
absolutely
nowhere
to
go
nowhere
he
belonged
he
realized
that
natalie
had
never
put
him
in
touch
with
her
boss
at
martian
signal
barefoot
there
was
much
of
anywhere
he
could
go
but
he
did
want
to
be
home
with
mimi
and
he
did
want
to
walk
past
natalie
barefoot
he
ended
up
in
the
alleyway
behind
kurt
again
with
nowhere
else
to
go
blake
and
kurt
got
back
around
suppertime
and
by
then
alan
had
counted
every
shingle
on
the
roofs
of
the
garages
had
carefully
snapped
the
sharps
off
of
two
syringes
he
found
in
some
weeds
and
then
sat
and
waited
until
he
was
ready
to
scream
blake
walked
confidently
into
the
shop
through
kurt
nest
and
to
the
back
door
he
opened
it
and
smiled
at
adam
come
on
in
he
said

alan
said
how

the
movie
it
was
fine
kurt
said
incredible

years

least
so
jesus

like
that
it
was
just
a
e
kurt
said
asses
and
explosions
alan
felt
a
wave
of
affection
for
his
friend
and
an
indefinite
sadness
a
feeling
that
they
were
soon
to
be
parted
kurt
stretched
and
cracked
his
knuckles
getting
time
for
me
to
go
out
diving
let
go
get
some
dinner
okay
andy
said
to
brad
guys
kurt
said
locking
the
door
behind
them
i
sorry
she
said
there
had
been
five
minutes
of
on
the
line
only
the
girl
crying
in
the
background
at
his
end
she
was
sure
if
he
set
the
phone
down
or
if
he
was
listening
but
the
sorry
drew
a
small
audible
breath
out
of
him
i
really
really
sorry
she
said
and
her
hands
felt
sticky
with
blood
god
i
just
wanted
to
mimi
was
back
in
bed
when
they
got
home
alan
took
a
shower
and
scrubbed
at
his
feet
then
padded
silently
around
the
shuttered
bedroom
dressing
in
the
dark
mimi
made
a
sleepful
noise
i
making
dinner
he
said
want
some
can
you
bring
it
up
here
she
said
yeah

he
said
i
just

she
waved
a
hand
at
the
door
then
let
it
flop
back
down
to
the
bed
it
all
right
babe
he
said
he
and
brad
ate
dinner
in
silence
in
the
kitchen
boiled
hot
dogs
with
cheese
and
sliced
baby
tomatoes
from
the
garden
and
lemonade
from
scratch
bradley
ate
seven
mimi
had
three
bites
out
of
the
one
that
he
brought
up
to
her
room
and
when
he
went
up
to
collect
her
plate
she
was
asleep
and
had
the
covers
wrapped
snugly
around
her
he
took
a
spare
sheet
and
a
blanket
out
of
the
linen
closet
and
brought
it
downstairs
and
made
up
the
living
room
sofa
in
moments
he
was
sleeping
this
night
he
was
keenly
aware
of
what
had
roused
him
from
sleep
it
was
a
scream
at
the
back
of
the
house
a
scared
drunken
scream
that
was
half
a
roar
he
was
at
the
back
door
in
a
moment
still
scrubbing
at
his
eyes
with
his
fists
and
bennett
was
there
already
he
opened
the
door
and
hit
the
switch
that
turned
on
the
garden
lights
the
back
porch
lights
the
garage
lights
in
the
coach
house
it
was
bright
enough
to
dazzle
him
but
he
squinted
in
anticipation
so
it
only
took
him
a
moment
to
take
in
the
tableau
there
was
link
on
the
ground
splayed
out
and
face
down
wearing
boxer
shorts
and
nothing
else
his
face
in
a
vegetable
bed
in
the
next
door
yard
there
was
krishna
standing
in
the
doorway
face
grim
holding
a
hammer
and
advancing
on
link
he
shouted
something
wordless
and
alarmed
and
link
rolled
over
and
climbed
up
to
his
feet
and
lurched
a
few
steps
deeper
into
the
yard
limping
badly
krishna
advanced
two
steps
into
the
yard
hammer
held
casually
at
his
waist
alan
barefoot
ran
to
the
dividing
fence
and
threw
himself
at
it
going
up
it
like
a
cat
landing
hard
and
painfully
feeling
something
small
and
important
give
in
his
ankle
krishna
nodded
cordially
at
him
then
hefted
the
hammer
again
krishna
took
another
step
toward
alan
and
then
natalie
moving
so
fast
that
she
was
a
blur
streaked
out
of
the
back
door
leaping
onto
krishna
back
she
held
there
for
a
minute
and
he
rocked
on
his
heels
but
then
he
swung
the
hammer
back
the
claws
first
it
took
her
just
above
her
left
eye
with
a
sound
like
an
awl
punching
through
leather
and
her
cry
was
terrible
she
let
go
and
fell
over
backward
holding
her
face
screaming
but
it
was
enough
time
enough
distraction
and
alan
had
hold
of
krishna
wrist
remembering
a
time
a
long
time
ago
he
pulled
hand
to
his
face
heedless
of
the
shining
hammer
and
bit
down
on
the
base
of
his
thumb
as
hard
as
he
could
until
krishna
loosed
the
hammer
with
a
shout
it
grazed
alan
temple
and
then
bounced
off
his
collarbone
on
the
way
to
the
ground
and
he
was
momentarily
stunned
and
here
was
link
gasping
with
each
step
left
leg
useless
but
hauling
himself
forward
anyway
big
brawny
arms
reaching
for
krishna
pasting
a
hard
punch
on
his
cheek
and
then
taking
hold
of
his
throat
and
bearing
him
down
to
the
ground
alan
looked
around
benny
was
still
on
his
side
of
the
fence
face
poked
out
from
around
the
door
the
sound
of
another
hard
punch
made
him
look
around
as
link
shook
the
ache
out
of
his
knuckles
and
made
to
lay
another
on
krishna
face
he
had
a
forearm
across
his
throat
and
krishna
gasped
for
breath
do
adam
said
link
looked
at
him
lip
stuck
out
in
belligerence
stop

said

hand
on
his
shoulder

krishna
made
a
choking
sound
link
eased
up
on
him
a
little
and
he
drew
a
ragged
breath
go
ahead
and
call
them
he
rasped
alan
took
a
slow
step
back
brian

link
looked
at
his
sister
blood
streaming
down
her
face
at
misshapen
nose
and
mouth
distorted
into
a
pink
meaty
sneer
he
clenched
each
fist
in
turn
no
cops
he
said
natalie
spat

hell

spat
again

was
running
into
her
eye
down
her
cheek
into
her
mouth

said

it
was
as
she
turned
to
go
that
krishna
made
a
lunge
for
the
hammer
billy
was
already
kicking
it
out
of
the
way
and
link
thrown
from
his
chest
got
up
on
one
knee
and
punched
him
hard
in
the
kidneys

he
went

volleyball
beneath
his
baggy
trousers
no
link
said

toward

andrew
stood
warily
near
krishna
get
up
he
said
mimi
in
his
doorway
across
the
fence
made
a
sound
that
was
half
a
moan
krishna
lay
still
for
a
moment
then
slowly
struggled
to
his
knees
and
then
his
feet
now
what
krishna
said

hand
pressed
to
his
pulped
cheek

teased
at
how
that
felt
and
realized
that
it
did
feel
like
he
thought
it
would
it
feel
good
go
krishna
he
said
get
out
of
this
house
and
get
out
of
my
sight
and
do
ever
come
back
again
stay
away
from
my
brother
you
will
never
profit
by
your
association
with
him
he
is
dead
the
best
he
can
do
for
you
is
make
you
dead
too
go
and
krishna
went
slowly
painfully
he
stood
and
hobbled
toward
the
front
door
mimi
watched
him
go
and
she
smiled
once
he
was
gone
benny
said
kurt
shop
is
on
fire
they
ran
the
two
of
them
up
augusta
leaving
mimi
behind
wrapped
in
her
blanket
they
could
smell
the
smoke
as
soon
as
they
crossed
kensington
and
they
could
see
the
flames
licking
out
of
the
dark
black
clouds
just
a
moment
later
the
smell
was
terrible
a
roiling
chemical
reek
that
burned
the
skin
and
the
lungs
and
the
eyes
all
those
electronics
crisping
and
curling
and
blackening
is
he
in
there
alan
said
yes
barry
said
trapped
call
the
fire
department
andrew
said
and
ran
for
the
door
fishing
in
his
pocket
for
his
keys
call
he
got
the
door
open
and
left
his
keys
in
the
lock
pulling
his
shirt
up
over
his
head
he
managed
a
step
into
the
building
two
steps
and
the
heat
beat
him
back
he
sucked
up
air
and
ran
for
it
again
the
heat
was
incredible
searing
he
snorted
half
a
breath
and
felt
the
hair
inside
his
nostrils
scorch
and
curl
and
the
burning
was
nearly
intolerable
he
dropped
down
on
all
fours
and
tried
to
peer
under
the
smoke
tried
to
locate
kurt
but
he
could
find
him
alan
crawled
to
the
back
of
the
store
to
kurt
den
sure
that
his
friend
would
have
been
back
there
worn
out
from
a
night
dumpster
diving
he
took
a
false
turn
and
found
himself
up
against
the
refrigerator
the
little
piece
of
linoleum
that
denoted
kurt
kitchen
was
hot
and
soft
under
his
hands
melting
and
scorching
he
reoriented
himself
spinning
around
slowly
and
crawled
again
tears
were
streaming
freely
down
his
face
and
between
them
and
the
smoke
he
could
barely
see
he
drew
closer
to
the
shop
rear
nearly
there
and
then
he
was
there
looking
for
kurt
he
found
him
leaned
up
against
the
emergency
door
at
the
back
of
the
shop
fingers
jammed
into
the
sliver
of
a
gap
between
the
door
bottom
and
the
ground
alan
tried
the
door
pushbar
but
there
was
something
blocking
the
door
from
the
other
side
he
tried
slapping
kurt
a
couple
times
but
he
would
not
be
roused
his
breath
came
in
tiny
puffs
alan
took
his
hand
then
the
other
hand
and
hoisted
his
head
and
neck
and
shoulders
up
onto
his
back
and
began
to
crawl
for
the
front
door
going
as
fast
as
he
could
in
the
blaze
he
got
lost
again
and
the
floor
was
hot
enough
to
raise
blisters
when
he
emerged
with
kurt
he
heard
the
sirens
he
breathed
hard
in
the
night
air
as
he
watched
two
fire
trucks
cleared
the
corner
going
the
wrong
way
down
augusta
speeding
toward
him
he
looked
at
billy
what
is
kurt
all
right
sure
he
fine
he
thought
a
moment
the
ambulance
man
will
want
to
talk
with
him
he
said
and
the
tv
people
soon
let
get
out
of
here
brad
said
all
right
he
said
now
you
talking
though
it
was
only
three
or
four
blocks
back
to
adam
place
it
took
the
better
part
of
half
an
hour
relying
on
the
back
alleys
and
the
dark
to
cover
his
retreat
hoping
that
the
ambulance
drivers
and
firefighters
would
catch
him
here
having
to
lug
kurt
made
him
especially
suspect
and
he
did
have
a
single
good
explanation
for
being
caught
toting
around
an
unconscious
punk
in
the
dead
of
night
come
on
brent
adam
said
let
get
home
and
put
this
one
to
bed
and
you
and
me
have
a
nice
chat
you
do
want
me
to
call
an
ambulance
kurt
startled
at
this
and
his
head
lolled
back
one
eye
opened
a
crack
no
alan
said
no
ambulances
no
cops
no
firemen
just
me
and
him
i
make
him
better
he
said
the
smoke
smell
was
terrible
and
pervaded
everything
no
matter
which
direction
the
wind
blew
from
adam
was
nearly
home
when
he
realized
that
his
place
and
his
lover
and
everything
he
cared
about
in
the
entire
world
were
on
fire
which
could
possibly
be
a
coincidence
the
flames
licked
his
porch
and
the
hot
air
had
blown
out
two
of
the
windows
on
the
second
story
the
flames
were
lapping
at
the
outside
of
the
building
crawling
over
the
inside
walls
no
coincidence
kurt
coughed
hard
his
chest
spasming
against
alan
back
alan
set
him
down
as
in
a
dream
as
in
a
dream
he
picked
his
way
through
the
flames
on
his
porch
and
reached
for
the
doorknob
it
burned
his
hand
it
was
locked
his
keys
were
in
kurt
door
all
the
way
up
augusta
around
the
back
bentley
called
headed
for
the
fence
gate
alan
vaulted
the
porch
rail
crashing
though
the
wild
grasses
and
ornamental
scrub
come
on
bentley
said
his
hand
throbbed
with
the
burn
the
back
yard
was
still
lit
up
like
christmas
all
the
lights
ablaze
shining
through
the
smoke
the
ash
of
books
swirling
in
it
buoyed
aloft
on
hot
currents
fragments
of
words
chasing
each
other
like
clouds
of
gnats
alan
kurt
croaked
somehow
he
followed
them
back
into
the
yard
alan
he
held
out
his
hand
which
glowed
alan
looked
closer
it
was
his
pda
stubby
wireless
card
poking
out
of
it
online
look
alan
shook
his
head
not
now
mimi
somewhere
up
there
was
mimi
look
kurt
croaked
he
coughed
again
and
went
down
to
his
knees
arnos
took
the
pda
in
hand
and
peered
at
it
it
was
a
familiar
app
the
traffic
analysis
app
the
thing
that
monitored
packet
loss
between
the
nodes
lyman
and
kurt
had
long
since
superimposed
the
logical
network
map
over
a
physical
map
of
the
market
using
overlays
to
show
the
degree
to
which
the
access
points
were
well
connected
and
firing
on
all
cylinders
the
map
was
painted
in
green
packets
flying
unimpeded
throughout
the
empty
nighttime
market
and
there
approaching
him
moving
through
the
alleys
toward
his
garage
a
blob
of
interference
a
slow
bobbing
something
that
was
scattering
radio
waves
as
it
made
its
way
toward
him
even
on
a
screen
he
recognized
that
walk
davey
not
a
coincidence
the
fires
mimi
he
called
the
back
window
was
blown
out
crystal
slivers
of
glass
all
around
him
on
the
back
lawn
billy
was
at
his
side
holding
something
a
knife
the
knife
serrated
edge
sharp
cracked
handle
wound
with
knotted
twine
but
as
he
reached
for
it
it
was
cracked
it
was
the
knife
the
wings
knife
krishna
knife
you
forgot
this
he
said
taking
the
pda
then
davey
was
in
the
yard
he
cocked
his
head
and
eyed
the
knife
warily
where
you
get
that
he
said
adam
shifted
his
grip
for
slashing
and
took
one
step
forward
stamping
his
foot
down
as
he
did
it
davey
retreated
a
step
then
took
two
steps
forward
he
set
the
fires
bentley
said
she
as
good
as
dead
cooked
be
long
now
she
be
cooked
darren
looked
at
him
for
the
first
time
oh
yes
he
said
about
right
i
never
found
you
no
matter
how
i
looked
you
do
get
found
if
you
do
want
to
brent
shook
his
head
he
set
the
fire
he
used
gasoline
up
the
stairs
so
it
would
spread
up
every
floor
quickly
aaron
growled
and
lunged
forward
slicing
wildly
but
davey
scurry
was
surprising
and
fast
and
nimble
you
going
to
stab
me
again
cut
me
again
what
do
you
suppose
that
will
get
you
he
weaker
than
he
was
then
we
got
six
years
then
weaker
we
get
ten
years
twenty
billy
was
hopping
from
foot
to
foot
alan
sliced
and
stabbed
again
and
the
knife
point
caught
little
bandy
leg
like
cutting
through
a
loaf
of
stale
bread
and
danny
gasped
and
hopped
back
another
step
he
gave
you
the
knife
did
he
he
gave
you
the
knife
last
time
last
time
he
took
me
to
the
school
yard
and
showed
me
you
and
your
girlfriend
he
explained
all
about
girlfriends
to
me
and
about
what
it
would
mean
once
our
secret
was
out
he
taught
me
the
words
taught
me
to
say
remember
billy
remember
how
you
taught
me
andrew
hesitated
he
taught
me
the
ritual
with
your
thumbtip
how
to
make
the
little
you
and
then
he
took
it
away
from
me
for
safekeeping
he
kept
it
in
one
of
his
rabbit
cages
around
on
the
other
side
of
the
mountain
it
not
there
now
have
you
seen
it
does
he
still
have
it
he
never
liked
having
a
little
brother
not
me
or
the
others
but
he
liked
having
that
little
thing
around
to
torture
billy
hissed
she
be
dead
in
minutes
he
said
in
seconds
another
one
dead
his
doing
killed
her
cut
her
up
buried
her
benny
chanted
sliced
her
open
and
cut
her
up
he
shrilled
alan
let
the
knife
fall
from
his
hands
benny
leapt
for
danny
hands
outstretched
danny
braced
for
the
impact
rolled
with
him
and
came
up
on
top
of
him
small
hands
in
benny
eyes
grinding
there
were
sirens
out
front
now
lots
of
sirens
a
distant
crash
and
a
rain
of
glass
fell
about
his
shoulders
he
turned
and
looked
up
looked
up
into
the
dormer
window
of
his
attic
four
stories
up
mimi
head
poked
out
from
the
window
wreathed
in
smoke
her
face
smudged
and
eyes
screwed
up
mimi
he
cried
she
climbed
unsteadily
onto
the
windowsill
perched
there
for
a
moment
then
she
leaned
forward
ducked
her
head
and
slipped
into
the
sky
her
magnificent
wings
unfolded
in
the
smoke
in
the
hot
ash
in
the
smoldering
remains
of
all
of
alan
life
in
human
society
her
magnificent
wings
unfolded
and
caught
the
air
with
a
sound
he
heard
and
with
a
downdraft
of
warm
air
that
blew
his
hair
off
his
forehead
like
a
lover
hand
smoky
smell
and
spicy
smell
she
flew
the
sirens
grew
louder
and
she
swooped
over
the
yard
she
gave
two
powerful
beats
of
her
wings
and
rose
higher
than
the
roof
then
she
circled
the
yard
in
great
loops
coming
lower
and
lower
with
each
pass
davey
and
benny
watched
her
kurt
watched
her
alan
watched
her
she
was
coming
straight
for
him
he
held
out
his
arms
and
she
fell
into
them
enfolding
them
both
in
her
wings
her
great
and
glorious
wings
come
on
she
said
kurt
was
already
limping
for
the
alley
benny
and
david
had
already
melted
away
they
were
alone
in
the
yard
and
the
sirens
were
so
loud
now
and
there
were
the
reflections
of
emergency
lights
bouncing
off
the
smoke
around
them
come
on
she
said
and
she
put
her
arms
around
his
waist
locking
her
wrists
it
took
five
beats
of
her
wings
to
get
them
aloft
and
they
barely
cleared
the
fence
but
they
banked
low
over
the
alley
and
she
beat
her
wings
again
and
then
they
were
gaining
altitude
catching
an
updraft
from
the
burning
house
on
wales
avenue
rising
so
high
into
the
sky
that
he
felt
like
they
would
fly
to
the
moon
the
day
that
lyman
and
kurt
were
on
the
cover
of
now
magazine
they
dropped
by
martian
signal
to
meet
with
natalie
boss
lyman
carried
the
pitch
package
polyethnic
edgy
and
cool
with
great
copy
natalie
met
them
she
grown
out
her
hair
and
wore
it
with
bangs
hanging
over
the
scar
on
her
forehead
just
over
her
left
eye
two
punctures
with
little
dents
three
surgeries
had
cleared
all
the
bone
fragments
from
the
orbit
of
that
eye
and
she
kept
her
sight
once
she
was
out
of
the
hospital
she
quickly
became
the
best
employee
martian
signal
had
ever
had
she
quickly
became
manager
she
quickly
undertook
to
make
several
improvements
in
the
daily
operations
of
the
store
that
increased
turnover
by
percent
she
slowly
and
reluctantly
hired
her
brother
but
his
gimpy
knee
made
it
hard
for
him
to
bend
down
to
reshelve
and
he
quickly
quit
kurt
and
natalie
hugged
and
lyman
formally
shook
her
hand
and
then
shook
her
boss
hand
it
took
less
than
an
hour
to
convince
her
boss
to
let
them
put
up
their
access
point
on
the
way
back
three
different
people
stopped
them
and
told
them
how
much
they
liked
the
article
and
swore
that
the
first
thing
they
do
when
they
got
home
would
be
to
open
up
their
networks
and
rename
them
parasitenet
lyman
handled
the
for
this
and
kurt
smiled
and
fiddled
with
his
pda
and
watched
the
sky
looking
for
a
girl
with
wings
as
wide
as
a
house
i
went
to
the
house
she
said
as
he
tended
the
fire
turning
the
yams
in
the
coals
and
stirring
the
pot
in
which
his
fish
stew
bubbled
i
went
to
the
house
she
said
resting
up
from
the
long
flight
she
flown
from
toronto
to
craig
distant
warm
shores
far
away
from
kensington
market
and
krishna
and
billy
and
danny
i
went
to
the
house
she
said
and
andy
worked
hard
to
keep
the
grin
off
his
face
for
been
miserable
during
her
long
absence
and
now
he
could
scarcely
contain
his
delight
i
went
to
the
house
and
there
was
no
one
home
i
had
the
address
given
me
and
it
was
just
like
you
described
it
to
me
down
to
the
basketball
hoop
in
the
driveway
it
was
empty
but
it
was
as
i
remembered
it
they
lived
there
lived
there
you
were
right
that
was
the
house
that
was
the
house
i
lived
in
i
rang
the
doorbell
then
i
peeked
in
through
a
crack
in
the
blinds
the
rooms
were
empty
no
furniture
just
blinds
it
was
night
and
no
one
was
looking
so
i
flew
up
to
the
third
floor
to
the
window
i
stared
out
all
those
times
the
window
was
unlatched
and
i
slid
aside
the
screen
and
let
myself
in
the
room
was
empty
no
carpet
no
frilly
bed
and
stuffed
animals
no
desk
no
clothes
in
the
closet
no
hangers
the
only
thing
in
the
room
was
a
small
box
plugged
into
the
wall
with
a
network
cable
snaking
away
into
the
phone
jack
it
had
small
lights
on
it
blinking
it
was
like
the
one
you
had
in
your
attic
a
wireless
access
point
i
remembered
their
names
then
oliver
and
patricia
they
been
my
mother
and
father
for
a
few
years
set
me
up
with
my
first
apartment
this
had
been
their
house
i
slept
there
that
day
then
come
nightfall
i
set
out
again
to
come
home
to
you
something
woke
andy
from
his
sound
sleep
nestled
in
her
wings
in
her
arms
a
tread
on
craig
inviolable
soil
someone
afoot
on
his
brother
slowly
he
got
himself
loose
of
mimi
and
sat
up
and
looked
around
the
golem
standing
before
him
was
small
and
its
eyes
glowed
red
it
bent
over
and
set
something
down
on
the
earth
a
bundle
of
smoked
meat
it
nodded
at
him
he
nodded
back
thank
you
he
said
mimi
put
her
hand
on
his
calf
is
it
okay
it
right
he
said
just
as
it
was
meant
to
be
he
returned
to
her
arms
and
they
kissed
no
falling
in
love
she
said
perish
the
thought
he
said
she
bit
his
lip
and
he
bit
hers
and
they
kissed
again
and
then
he
was
asleep
and
at
peace
