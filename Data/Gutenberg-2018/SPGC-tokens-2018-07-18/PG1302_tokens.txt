there
are
many
of
the
forces
of
nature
which
tend
to
injure
books
but
among
them
all
not
one
has
been
half
so
destructive
as
fire
it
would
be
tedious
to
write
out
a
bare
list
only
of
the
numerous
libraries
and
bibliographical
treasures
which
in
one
way
or
another
have
been
seized
by
the
as
his
own
chance
conflagrations
fanatic
incendiarism
judicial
bonfires
and
even
household
stoves
have
time
after
time
thinned
the
treasures
as
well
as
the
rubbish
of
past
ages
until
probably
not
one
thousandth
part
of
the
books
that
have
been
are
still
extant
this
destruction
can
not
however
be
reckoned
as
all
loss
for
had
not
the
cleansing
fires
removed
mountains
of
rubbish
from
our
midst
strong
destructive
measures
would
have
become
a
necessity
from
sheer
want
of
space
in
which
to
store
so
many
volumes
before
the
invention
of
printing
books
were
comparatively
scarce
and
knowing
as
we
do
how
very
difficult
it
is
even
after
the
has
been
working
for
half
a
century
to
make
a
collection
of
half
a
million
books
we
are
forced
to
receive
with
great
incredulity
the
accounts
in
old
writers
of
the
wonderful
extent
of
ancient
libraries
the
historian
gibbon
very
incredulous
in
many
things
accepts
without
questioning
the
fables
told
upon
this
subject
no
doubt
the
libraries
of
mss
collected
generation
after
generation
by
the
egyptian
ptolemies
became
in
the
course
of
time
the
most
extensive
ever
then
known
and
were
famous
throughout
the
world
for
the
costliness
of
their
ornamentation
and
importance
of
their
untold
contents
two
of
these
were
at
alexandria
the
larger
of
which
was
in
the
quarter
called
bruchium
these
volumes
like
all
manuscripts
of
those
early
ages
were
written
on
sheets
of
parchment
having
a
wooden
roller
at
each
end
so
that
the
reader
needed
only
to
unroll
a
portion
at
a
time
during
caesar
alexandrian
war
the
larger
collection
was
consumed
by
fire
and
again
burnt
by
the
saracens
in
an
immense
loss
was
inflicted
upon
mankind
thereby
but
when
we
are
told
of
or
even
of
such
volumes
being
destroyed
we
instinctively
feel
that
such
numbers
must
be
a
great
exaggeration
equally
incredulous
must
we
be
when
we
read
of
half
a
million
volumes
being
burnt
at
carthage
some
centuries
later
and
other
similar
accounts
among
the
earliest
records
of
the
wholesale
destruction
of
books
is
that
narrated
by
luke
when
after
the
preaching
of
paul
many
of
the
ephesians
which
used
curious
arts
brought
their
books
together
and
burned
them
before
all
men
and
they
counted
the
price
of
them
and
found
it
pieces
of
silver
acts
xix
doubtless
these
books
of
idolatrous
divination
and
alchemy
of
enchantments
and
witchcraft
were
righteously
destroyed
by
those
to
whom
they
had
been
and
might
again
be
spiritually
injurious
and
doubtless
had
they
escaped
the
fire
then
not
one
of
them
would
have
survived
to
the
present
time
no
of
that
age
being
now
extant
nevertheless
i
must
confess
to
a
certain
amount
of
mental
disquietude
and
uneasiness
when
i
think
of
books
worth
denarii
or
speaking
roughly
say
of
our
modern
money
being
made
into
bonfires
what
curious
illustrations
of
early
heathenism
of
devil
worship
of
serpent
worship
of
sun
worship
and
other
archaic
forms
of
religion
of
early
astrological
and
chemical
lore
derived
from
the
egyptians
the
persians
the
greeks
what
abundance
of
superstitious
observances
and
what
is
now
termed
folklore
what
riches
too
for
the
philological
student
did
those
many
books
contain
and
how
famous
would
the
library
now
be
that
could
boast
of
possessing
but
a
few
of
them
the
received
opinion
is
that
the
pieces
of
silver
here
mentioned
were
roman
denarii
which
were
the
silver
pieces
then
commonly
used
in
ephesus
if
now
we
weigh
a
denarius
against
modern
silver
it
is
exactly
equal
to
ninepence
and
fifty
thousand
times
ninepence
gives
it
is
always
a
difficult
matter
to
arrive
at
a
just
estimate
of
the
relative
value
of
the
same
coin
in
different
ages
but
reckoning
that
money
then
had
at
least
ten
times
the
purchasing
value
of
money
now
we
arrive
at
what
was
probably
about
the
value
of
the
magical
books
burnt
viz
the
ruins
of
ephesus
bear
unimpeachable
evidence
that
the
city
was
very
extensive
and
had
magnificent
buildings
it
was
one
of
the
free
cities
governing
itself
its
trade
in
shrines
and
idols
was
very
extensive
being
spread
through
all
known
lands
there
the
magical
arts
were
remarkably
prevalent
and
notwithstanding
the
numerous
converts
made
by
the
early
christians
the
gr
grammata
or
little
scrolls
upon
which
magic
sentences
were
written
formed
an
extensive
trade
up
to
the
fourth
century
these
writings
were
used
for
divination
as
a
protection
against
the
evil
eye
and
generally
as
charms
against
all
evil
they
were
carried
about
the
person
so
that
probably
thousands
of
them
were
thrown
into
the
flames
by
paul
hearers
when
his
glowing
words
convinced
them
of
their
superstition
imagine
an
open
space
near
the
grand
temple
of
diana
with
fine
buildings
around
slightly
raised
above
the
crowd
the
apostle
preaching
with
great
power
and
persuasion
concerning
superstition
holds
in
thrall
the
assembled
multitude
on
the
outskirts
of
the
crowd
are
numerous
bonfires
upon
which
jew
and
gentile
are
throwing
into
the
flames
bundle
upon
bundle
of
scrolls
while
an
asiarch
with
his
looks
on
with
the
conventional
stolidity
of
policemen
in
all
ages
and
all
nations
it
must
have
been
an
impressive
scene
and
many
a
worse
subject
has
been
chosen
for
the
walls
of
the
royal
academy
books
in
those
early
times
whether
orthodox
or
heterodox
appear
to
have
had
a
precarious
existence
the
heathens
at
each
fresh
outbreak
of
persecution
burnt
all
the
christian
writings
they
could
find
and
the
christians
when
they
got
the
upper
hand
retaliated
with
interest
upon
the
pagan
literature
the
mohammedan
reason
for
destroying
books
if
they
contain
what
is
in
the
koran
they
are
superfluous
and
if
they
contain
anything
opposed
to
it
they
are
immoral
seems
indeed
to
have
been
the
general
rule
for
all
such
devastators
the
invention
of
printing
made
the
entire
destruction
of
any
works
much
more
difficult
so
quickly
and
so
extensively
did
books
spread
through
all
lands
on
the
other
hand
as
books
multiplied
so
did
destruction
go
hand
in
hand
with
production
and
soon
were
printed
books
doomed
to
suffer
in
the
same
penal
fires
that
up
to
then
had
been
fed
on
mss
only
at
cremona
in
books
printed
in
hebrew
were
publicly
burnt
as
heretical
simply
on
account
of
their
language
and
cardinal
ximenes
at
the
capture
of
granada
treated
copies
of
the
koran
in
the
same
way
at
the
time
of
the
reformation
in
england
a
great
destruction
of
books

not

which

we
now
possess
being
used
for
baking
pyes
at
the
great
fire
of
london
in
the
number
of
books
burnt
was
enormous
not
only
in
private
houses
and
corporate
and
church
libraries
were
priceless
collections
reduced
to
cinders
but
an
immense
stock
of
books
removed
from
paternoster
row
by
the
stationers
for
safety
was
burnt
to
ashes
in
the
vaults
of
paul
cathedral
coming
nearer
to
our
own
day
how
thankful
we
ought
to
be
for
the
preservation
of
the
cotton
library
great
was
the
consternation
in
the
literary
world
of
when
they
heard
of
the
fire
at
ashburnham
house
westminster
where
at
that
time
the
cotton
mss
were
deposited
by
great
exertions
the
fire
was
conquered
but
not
before
many
mss
had
been
quite
destroyed
and
many
others
injured
much
skill
was
shown
in
the
partial
restoration
of
these
books
charred
almost
beyond
recognition
they
were
carefully
separated
leaf
by
leaf
soaked
in
a
chemical
solution
and
then
pressed
flat
between
sheets
of
transparent
paper
a
curious
heap
of
scorched
leaves
previous
to
any
treatment
and
looking
like
a
monster
wasps
nest
may
be
seen
in
a
glass
case
in
the
department
of
the
british
museum
showing
the
condition
to
which
many
other
volumes
had
been
reduced
just
a
hundred
years
ago
the
mob
in
the
birmingham
riots
burnt
the
valuable
library
of
priestley
and
in
the
gordon
riots
were
burnt
the
literary
and
other
collections
of
lord
mansfield
the
celebrated
judge
he
who
had
the
courage
first
to
decide
that
the
slave
who
reached
the
english
shore
was
thenceforward
a
free
man
the
loss
of
the
latter
library
drew
from
the
poet
cowper
two
short
and
weak
poems
the
poet
first
deplores
the
destruction
of
the
valuable
printed
books
and
then
the
irretrievable
loss
to
history
by
the
burning
of
his
lordship
many
personal
manuscripts
and
contemporary
documents
their
pages
mangled
burnt
and
torn
the
loss
was
his
alone
but
ages
yet
to
come
shall
mourn
the
burning
of
his
own
the
second
poem
commences
with
the
following
doggerel
when
wit
and
genius
meet
their
doom
in
flame
they
tell
us
of
the
fate
of
rome
and
bid
us
fear
the
same
the
much
finer
and
more
extensive
library
of
priestley
was
left
unnoticed
and
unlamented
by
the
orthodox
poet
who
probably
felt
a
complacent
satisfaction
at
the
destruction
of
heterodox
books
the
owner
being
an
unitarian
minister
the
magnificent
library
of
strasbourg
was
burnt
by
the
shells
of
the
german
army
in
then
disappeared
for
ever
together
with
other
unique
documents
the
original
records
of
the
famous
between
gutenberg
one
of
the
first
printers
and
his
partners
upon
the
right
understanding
of
which
depends
the
claim
of
gutenberg
to
the
invention
of
the
art
the
flames
raged
between
high
brick
walls
roaring
louder
than
a
blast
furnace
seldom
indeed
have
mars
and
pluto
had
so
dainty
a
sacrifice
offered
at
their
shrines
for
over
all
the
din
of
battle
and
the
reverberation
of
monster
artillery
the
burning
leaves
of
the
first
printed
bible
and
many
another
priceless
volume
were
wafted
into
the
sky
the
ashes
floating
for
miles
on
the
heated
air
and
carrying
to
the
astonished
countryman
the
first
news
of
the
devastation
of
his
capital
when
the
offor
collection
was
put
to
the
hammer
by
messrs
sotheby
and
wilkinson
the
auctioneers
of
wellington
street
and
when
about
three
days
of
the
sale
had
been
gone
through
a
fire
occurred
in
the
adjoining
house
and
gaining
possession
of
the
sale
rooms
made
a
speedy
end
of
the
unique
bunyan
and
other
rarities
then
on
show
i
was
allowed
to
see
the
ruins
on
the
following
day
and
by
means
of
a
ladder
and
some
scrambling
managed
to
enter
the
sale
room
where
parts
of
the
floor
still
remained
it
was
a
fearful
sight
those
scorched
rows
of
volumes
still
on
the
shelves
and
curious
was
it
to
notice
how
the
flames
burning
off
the
backs
of
the
books
first
had
then
run
up
behind
the
shelves
and
so
attacked
the
of
the
volumes
standing
upon
them
leaving
the
majority
with
a
perfectly
untouched
oval
centre
of
white
paper
and
plain
print
while
the
whole
surrounding
parts
were
but
a
mass
of
black
cinders
the
salvage
was
sold
in
one
lot
for
a
small
sum
and
the
purchaser
after
a
good
deal
of
sorting
and
mending
and
binding
placed
about
volumes
for
sale
at
puttick
and
simpson
in
the
following
year
so
too
when
the
curious
old
library
which
was
in
a
gallery
of
the
dutch
church
austin
friars
was
nearly
destroyed
in
the
fire
which
devastated
the
church
in
the
books
which
escaped
were
sadly
injured
not
long
before
i
had
spent
some
hours
there
hunting
for
english
books
and
shall
never
forget
the
state
of
dirt
in
which
i
came
away
without
anyone
to
care
for
them
the
books
had
remained
untouched
for
many
a
dust
half
an
inch
thick
having
settled
upon
them
then
came
the
fire
and
while
the
roof
was
all
ablaze
streams
of
hot
water
like
a
boiling
deluge
washed
down
upon
them
the
wonder
was
they
were
not
turned
into
a
muddy
pulp
after
all
was
over
the
whole
of
the
library
no
portion
of
which
could
legally
be
given
away
was
for
to
the
corporation
of
london
scorched
and
sodden
the
salvage
came
into
the
hands
of
mr
overall
their
indefatigable
librarian
in
a
hired
attic
he
hung
up
the
volumes
that
would
bear
it
over
strings
like
clothes
to
dry
and
there
for
weeks
and
weeks
were
the
stained
distorted
volumes
often
without
covers
often
in
single
leaves
carefully
tended
and
washing
sizing
pressing
and
binding
effected
wonders
and
no
one
who
looks
upon
the
attractive
little
alcove
in
the
guildhall
library
labelled
oe
bibliotheca
ecclesiae
and
sees
the
rows
of
backs
could
imagine
that
not
long
ago
this
the
most
curious
portion
of
the
city
literary

was
in
a
state
when
a

would

more

he

the

library
was
celebrated
throughout
the

it
had
been
collected
by
the
pinelli
family
for
many
generations
and
comprised
an
extraordinary
number
of
greek
latin
and
italian
works
many
of
them
first
editions
beautifully
illuminated
together
with
numerous
mss
dating
from
the
to
the
century
the
whole
library
was
sold
by
the
executors
to
edwards
bookseller
of
pall

who
placed
the
volumes
in
three
vessels
for
transport
from

of
the
vessels
was
captured
but
the
pirate
disgusted
at
not

threw
all

the
other
two
vessels
escaped
and
delivered
their
freight
safely
and
in
the
books
which
had
been
so
near
destruction
were
sold
at

in

of

water
has
frequently
caused
irreparable
injury
positive
wet
is
fortunately
of
rare
occurrence
in
a
library
but
is
very
destructive
when
it
does
come
and
if
long
continued
the
substance
of
the
paper
succumbs
to
the
unhealthy
influence
and
rots
and
rots
until
all
fibre
disappears
and
the
paper
is
reduced
to
a
white
decay
which
crumbles
into
powder
when
handled
few
old
libraries
in
england
are
now
so
thoroughly
neglected
as
they
were
thirty
years
ago
the
state
of
many
of
our
collegiate
and
cathedral
libraries
was
at
that
time
simply
appalling
i
could
mention
many
instances
one
especially
where
a
window
having
been
left
broken
for
a
long
time
the
ivy
had
pushed
through
and
crept
over
a
row
of
books
each
of
which
was
worth
hundreds
of
pounds
in
rainy
weather
the
water
was
conducted
as
by
a
pipe
along
the
tops
of
the
books
and
soaked
through
the
whole
in
another
and
smaller
collection
the
rain
came
straight
on
to
a
through
a
saturating
continually
the
top
shelf
containing
caxtons
and
other
early
english
books
one
of
which
although
rotten
was
sold
soon
after
by
permission
of
the
charity
commissioners
for
germany
too
the
very
of
printing
allows
similar
destruction
to
go
on
unchecked
if
the
following
letter
which
appeared
about
a
year
ago
in
the
has
any
truth
in
it
for
some
time
past
the
condition
of
the
library
at
wolfenbuttel
has
been
most
disgraceful
the
building
is
in
so
unsafe
a
condition
that
portions
of
the
walls
and
ceilings
have
fallen
in
and
the
many
treasures
in
books
and
mss
contained
in
it
are
exposed
to
damp
and
decay
an
appeal
has
been
issued
that
this
valuable
collection
may
not
be
allowed
to
perish
for
want
of
funds
and
that
it
may
also
be
now
at
length
removed
to
brunswick
since
wolfenbuttel
is
entirely
deserted
as
an
intellectual
centre
no
false
sentimentality
regarding
the
memory
of
its
former
custodians
leibnitz
and
lessing
should
hinder
this
project
lessing
himself
would
have
been
the
first
to
urge
that
the
library
and
its
utility
should
be
considered
above
all
things
the
collection
of
books
at
wolfenbuttel
is
simply
magnificent
and
i
can
not
but
hope
the
above
report
was
exaggerated
were
these
books
to
be
injured
for
the
want
of
a
small
sum
spent
on
the
roof
it
would
be
a
lasting
disgrace
to
the
nation
there
are
so
many
genuine
in
fatherland
that
the
commission
of
such
a
crime
would
seem
incredible
did
not
bibliographical
history
teem
with
similar
desecrations
this
was
written
in
since
which
time
a
new
building
has
been
erected
water
in
the
form
of
vapour
is
a
great
enemy
of
books
the
damp
attacking
both
outside
and
inside
outside
it
fosters
the
growth
of
a
white
mould
or
fungus
which
vegetates
upon
the
edges
of
the
leaves
upon
the
sides
and
in
the
joints
of
the
binding
it
is
easily
wiped
off
but
not
without
leaving
a
plain
mark
where
the
have
been
under
the
microscope

seen
to
be
a
miniature
forest
of
lovely
trees
covered
with
a
beautiful
white
foliage
upas
trees
whose
roots
are
embedded
in
the
leather
and
destroy
its
texture
inside
the
book
damp
encourages
the
growth
of
those
ugly
brown
spots
which
so
often
disfigure
prints
and
livres
de
luxe
especially
it
attacks
books
printed
in
the
early
part
of
this
century
when
had
just
discovered
that
they
could
bleach
their
rags
and
perfectly
white
paper
well
pressed
after
printing
had
become
the
fashion
this
paper
from
the
inefficient
means
used
to
neutralise
the
bleach
carried
the
seeds
of
decay
in
itself
and
when
exposed
to
any
damp
soon
became
discoloured
with
brown
stains
dibdin
extravagant
bibliographical
works
are
mostly
so
injured
and
although
the
bibliography
is
very
incorrect
and
his
inanities
and
wearisome
affectations
often
annoy
one
yet
his
books
are
so
beautifully
illustrated
and
he
is
so
full
of
personal
anecdote
and
chit
chat
that
it
grieves
the
heart
to
see
foxey
stains
common
in
his
most
superb
works
in
a
perfectly
dry
and
warm
library
these
spots
would
probably
remain
undeveloped
but
many
endowed
as
well
as
private
libraries
are
not
in
daily
use
and
are
often
injured
from
a
false
idea
that
a
hard
frost
and
prolonged
cold
do
no
injury
to
a
library
so
long
as
the
weather
is
dry
the
fact
is
that
books
should
never
be
allowed
to
get
really
cold
for
when
a
thaw
comes
and
the
weather
sets
in
warm
the
air
laden
with
damp
penetrates
the
inmost
recesses
and
working
its
way
between
the
volumes
and
even
between
the
leaves
deposits
upon
their
cold
surface
its
moisture
the
best
preventative
of
this
is
a
warm
atmosphere
during
the
frost
sudden
heating
when
the
frost
has
gone
being
useless
our
worst
enemies
are
sometimes
our
real
friends
and
perhaps
the
best
way
of
keeping
libraries
entirely
free
from
damp
is
to
circulate
our
enemy
in
the
shape
of
hot
water
through
pipes
laid
under
the
floor
the
facilities
now
offered
for
heating
such
pipes
from
the
outside
are
so
great
the
expense
comparatively
so
small
and
the
direct
gain
in
the
expulsion
of
damp
so
decided
that
where
it
can
be
accomplished
without
much
trouble
it
is
well
worth
the
doing
at
the
same
time
no
system
of
heating
should
be
allowed
to
supersede
the
open
grate
which
supplies
a
ventilation
to
the
room
as
useful
to
the
health
of
the
books
as
to
the
health
of
the
occupier
a
coal
fire
is
objectionable
on
many
grounds
it
is
dangerous
dirty
and
dusty
on
the
other
hand
an
asbestos
fire
where
the
lumps
are
judiciously
laid
gives
all
the
warmth
and
ventilation
of
a
common
fire
without
any
of
its
annoyances
and
to
any
one
who
loves
to
be
independent
of
servants
and
to
know
that
however
deeply
he
may
sleep
over
his
copy
his
fire
will
not
fail
to
keep
awake
an
asbestos
stove
is
invaluable
it
is
a
mistake
also
to
imagine
that
keeping
the
best
bound
volumes
in
a
glass
doored
is
a
preservative
the
damp
air
will
certainly
penetrate
and
as
the
absence
of
ventilation
will
assist
the
formation
of
mould
the
books
will
be
worse
off
than
if
they
had
been
placed
in
open
shelves
if
security
be
desirable
by
all
means
abolish
the
glass
and
place
ornamental
brass
in
its
stead
like
the
writers
of
old
cookery
books

stamped
special
receipts
with
the
testimony
of

experience

gas
and
heat
what
a
valuable
servant
is
gas
and
how
dreadfully
we
should
cry
out
were
it
to
be
banished
from
our
homes
and
yet
no
one
who
loves
his
books
should
allow
a
single
jet
in
his
library
unless
indeed
he
can
afford
a
sun
light
which
is
the
form
in
which
it
is
used
in
some
public
libraries
where
the
whole
of
the
fumes
are
carried
at
once
into
the
open
air
unfortunately
i
can
speak
from
experience
of
the
dire
effect
of
gas
in
a
confined
space
some
years
ago
when
placing
the
shelves
round
the
small
room
which
by
a
euphemism
is
called
my
library
i
took
the
precaution
of
making
two
ventilators
which
communicated
directly
with
the
outer
air
just
under
the
ceiling
for
economy
of
space
as
well
as
of
temper
for
lamps
of
all
kinds
are
sore
trials
i
had
a
gasalier
of
three
lights
over
the
table
the
effect
was
to
cause
great
heat
in
the
upper
regions
and
in
the
course
of
a
year
or
two
the
leather
valance
which
hung
from
the
window
as
well
as
the
fringe
which
dropped
from
each
shelf
to
keep
out
the
dust
was
just
like
tinder
and
in
some
parts
actually
fell
to
the
ground
by
its
own
weight
while
the
backs
of
the
books
upon
the
top
shelves
were
perished
and
crumbled
away
when
touched
being
reduced
to
the
consistency
of
scotch
snuff
this
was
of
course
due
to
the
sulphur
in
the
gas
fumes
i
remember
having
a
book
some
years
ago
from
the
top
shelf
in
the
library
of
the
london
institution
where
gas
is
used
and
the
whole
of
the
back
fell
off
in
my
hands
although
the
volume
in
other
respects
seemed
quite
uninjured
thousands
more
were
in
a
similar
plight
as
the
paper
of
the
volumes
is
uninjured
it
might
be
objected
that
after
all
gas
is
not
so
much
the
enemy
of
the
book
itself
as
of
its
covering
but
then
always
leaves
a
book
smaller
and
often
deprives
it
of
leaves
at
the
beginning
or
end
which
the
binder
wisdom
has
thought
useless
oh
the
havoc
i
have
seen
committed
by
binders
you
may
assume
your
most
impressive
aspect
you
may
write
down
your
instructions
as
if
you
were
making
your
last
will
and
testament
you
may
swear
you
will
not
pay
if
your
books
are
ploughed
is
all
in
vain
the
creed
of
a
binder
is
very
short
and
comprised
in
a
single
article
and
that
article
is
the
one
vile
word
shavings
but
not
now
will
i
follow
this
depressing
subject
binders
as
enemies
of
books
deserve
and
shall
have
a
whole
chapter
to
themselves
it
is
much
easier
to
decry
gas
than
to
find
a
remedy
sun
lights
require
especial
arrangements
and
are
very
expensive
on
account
of
the
quantity
of
gas
consumed
the
library
illumination
of
the
future
promises
to
be
the
electric
light
if
only
steady
and
moderate
in
price
it
would
be
a
great
boon
to
public
libraries
and
perhaps
the
day
is
not
far
distant
when
it
will
replace
gas
even
in
private
houses
that
will
indeed
be
a
day
of
jubilee
to
the
literary
labourer
the
injury
done
by
gas
is
so
generally
acknowledged
by
the
heads
of
our
national
libraries
that
it
is
strictly
excluded
from
their
domains
although
the
danger
from
explosion
and
fire
even
if
the
results
of
combustion
were
innocuous
would
be
sufficient
cause
for
its
banishment
the
electric
light
has
been
in
use
for
some
months
in
the
reading
room
of
the
british
museum
and
is
a
great
boon
to
the
readers
the
light
is
not
quite
equally
diffused
and
you
must
choose
particular
positions
if
you
want
to
work
happily
there
is
a
great
objection
too
in
the
humming
fizz
which
accompanies
the
action
of
the
electricity
there
is
a
still
greater
objection
when
small
pieces
of
hot
chalk
fall
on
your
bald
head
an
annoyance
which
has
been
lately
entirely
removed
by
placing
a
receptacle
beneath
each
burner
you
require
also
to
become
accustomed
to
the
whiteness
of
the
light
before
you
can
altogether
forget
it
but
with
all
its
faults
it
confers
a
great
boon
upon
students
enabling
them
not
only
to
work
three
hours
longer
in
the
but
restoring
to
them
the
use
of
foggy
and
dark
days
in
which
formerly
no
at
all
could
be
pursued
the
system
in
use
is
still
siemens
but
owing
to
long
experience
and
improvements
is
not
now
open
to
the
above
objections
heat
alone
without
any
noxious
fumes
is
if
continuous
very
injurious
to
books
and
without
gas
bindings
may
be
utterly
destroyed
by
desiccation
the
leather
losing
all
its
natural
oils
by
long
exposure
to
much
heat
it
is
therefore
a
great
pity
to
place
books
high
up
in
a
room
where
heat
of
any
kind
is
as
it
must
rise
to
the
top
and
if
sufficient
to
be
of
comfort
to
the
readers
below
is
certain
to
be
hot
enough
above
to
injure
the
bindings
the
surest
way
to
preserve
your
books
in
health
is
to
treat
them
as
you
would
your
own
children
who
are
sure
to
sicken
if
confined
in
an
atmosphere
which
is
impure
too
hot
too
cold
too
damp
or
too
dry
it
is
just
the
same
with
the
progeny
of
literature
if
any
credence
may
be
given
to
monkish
legends
books
have
sometimes
been
preserved
in
this
world
only
to
meet
a
desiccating
fate
in
the
world
to
come
the
story
is
probably
an
invention
of
the
enemy
to
throw
discredit
on
the
learning
and
ability
of
the
preaching
friars
an
order
which
was
at
constant
war
with
the
illiterate
secular
clergy
it
runs
thus
in
the
year
two
minorite
friars
who
had
all
their
lives
collected
books
died
in
accordance
with
popular
belief
they
were
at
once
conducted
before
the
heavenly
tribunal
to
hear
their
doom
taking
with
them
two
asses
laden
with
books
at
heaven
gate
the
porter
demanded
came
ye
the
minorites
replied
a
monastery
of
st
francis
said
the
porter
francis
shall
be
your
judge
so
that
saint
was
summoned
and
at
sight
of
the
friars
and
their
burden
demanded
who
they
were
and
why
they
had
brought
so
many
books
with
them
are
minorites
they
humbly
replied
we
have
brought
these
few
books
with
us
as
a
solatium
in
the
new
jerusalem
you
when
on
earth
practised
the
good
they
teach
sternly
demanded
the
saint
who
read
their
characters
at
a
glance
their
faltering
reply
was
sufficient
and
the
blessed
saint
at
once
passed
judgment
as
follows
as
seduced
by
a
foolish
vanity
and
against
your
vows
of
poverty
you
have
amassed
this
multitude
of
books
and
thereby
and
therefor
have
neglected
the
duties
and
broken
the
rules
of
your
order
you
are
now
sentenced
to
read
your
books
for
ever
and
ever
in
the
fires
of
hell
immediately
a
roaring
noise
filled
the
air
and
a
flaming
chasm
opened
in
which
friars
and
asses
and
books
were
suddenly
engulphed
chapter
iv
dust
and
neglect
dust
upon
books
to
any
extent
points
to
neglect
and
neglect
means
more
or
less
slow
decay
a
top
to
a
book
is
a
great
preventive
against
damage
by
dust
while
to
leave
books
with
rough
tops
and
unprotected
is
sure
to
produce
stains
and
dirty
margins
in
olden
times
when
few
persons
had
private
collections
of
books
the
collegiate
and
corporate
libraries
were
of
great
use
to
students
the
librarians
duties
were
then
no
sinecure
and
there
was
little
opportunity
for
dust
to
find
a
the
nineteenth
century
and
the
steam
press
ushered
in
a
new
era
by
degrees
the
libraries
which
were
unendowed
fell
behind
the
age
and
were
consequently
neglected
no
new
works
found
their
way
in
and
the
obsolete
old
books
were
left
uncared
for
and
unvisited
i
have
seen
many
old
libraries
the
doors
of
which
remained
unopened
from
week
end
to
week
end
where
you
inhaled
the
dust
of
with
every
breath
and
could
not
take
up
a
book
without
sneezing
where
old
boxes
full
of
older
literature
served
as
preserves
for
the
bookworm
without
even
an
autumn
battue
to
thin
the
breed
occasionally
these
libraries
were
i
speak
of
thirty
years
ago
put
even
to
vile
uses
such
as
would
have
shocked
all
ideas
of
propriety
could
our
ancestors
have
foreseen
their
fate
i
recall
vividly
a
bright
summer
morning
many
years
ago
when
in
search
of
caxtons
i
entered
the
inner
quadrangle
of
a
certain
wealthy
college
in
one
of
our
learned
universities
the
buildings
around
were
charming
in
their
grey
tones
and
shady
nooks
they
had
a
noble
history
too
and
their
scholarly
sons
were
and
are
not
unworthy
successors
of
their
ancestral
renown
the
sun
shone
warmly
and
most
of
the
casements
were
open
from
one
came
curling
a
whiff
of
tobacco
from
another
the
hum
of
conversation
from
a
third
the
tones
of
a
piano
a
couple
of
undergraduates
sauntered
on
the
shady
side
arm
in
arm
with
broken
caps
and
torn
gowns
proud
insignia
of
their
last
term
the
grey
stone
walls
were
covered
with
ivy
except
where
an
old
dial
with
its
antiquated
latin
inscription
kept
count
of
the
sun
ascent
the
chapel
on
one
side
only
distinguishable
from
the
rooms
by
the
shape
of
its
windows
seemed
to
keep
watch
over
the
morality
of
the
foundation
just
as
the
opposite
from
whence
issued
a
cook
did
of
its
worldly
prosperity
as
you
trod
the
level
pavement
you
passed
comfortable
nay
dainty
apartments
where
lace
curtains
at
the
windows
antimacassars
on
the
chairs
the
silver
and
the
moderated
academic
toils
books
on
gilded
shelf
or
table
caught
the
eye
and
as
you
turned
your
glance
from
the
luxurious
interiors
to
the
lawn
in
the
with
its
classic
fountain
also
gilded
by
sunbeams
the
mental
vision
saw
plainly
written
over
the
whole
the
union
of
luxury
and
learning
surely
here
thought
i
if
anywhere
the
old
world
literature
will
be
valued
and
nursed
with
gracious
care
so
with
a
pleasing
sense
of
the
general
congruity
of
all
around
me
i
enquired
for
the
rooms
of
the
librarian
nobody
seemed
to
be
quite
sure
of
his
name
or
upon
whom
the
bibliographical
mantle
had
descended
his
post
it
seemed
was
honorary
and
a
sinecure
being
imposed
as
a
rule
upon
the
youngest
fellow
no
one
cared
for
the
appointment
and
as
a
matter
of
course
the
keys
of
office
had
but
distant
acquaintance
with
the
lock
at
last
i
was
rewarded
with
success
and
politely
but
mutely
conducted
by
the
librarian
into
his
kingdom
of
dust
and
silence
the
dark
portraits
of
past
benefactors
looked
after
us
from
their
dusty
old
frames
in
dim
astonishment
as
we
passed
evidently
wondering
whether
we
meant
work
that
peculiar
flavour
which
haunts
certain
libraries
was
heavy
in
the
air
the
floor
was
dusty
making
the
sunbeams
as
we
passed
bright
with
atoms
the
shelves
were
dusty
the
stands
in
the
middle
were
thick
with
dust
the
old
leather
table
in
the
bow
window
and
the
chairs
on
either
side
were
very
dusty
replying
to
a
question
my
conductor
thought
there
was
a
manuscript
catalogue
of
the
library
somewhere
but
thought
also
that
it
was
not
easy
to
find
any
books
by
it
and
he
knew
not
at
the
minute
where
to
put
his
hand
upon
it
the
library
he
said
was
of
little
use
now
as
the
fellows
had
their
own
books
and
very
seldom
required
and
century
editions
and
no
new
books
had
been
added
to
the
collection
for
a
long
time
we
passed
down
a
few
steps
into
an
inner
library
where
piles
of
early
folios
were
wasting
away
on
the
ground
beneath
an
old
ebony
table
were
two
long
carved
oak
chests
i
lifted
the
lid
of
one
and
at
the
top
was
a
surplice
covered
with
dust
and
beneath
was
a
mass
of
tracts
commonwealth
quartos
unbound
a
prey
to
worms
and
decay
all
was
neglect
the
outer
door
of
this
room
which
was
open
was
nearly
on
a
level
with
the
quadrangle
some
coats
and
trousers
and
boots
were
upon
the
ebony
table
and
a
gyp
was
brushing
away
at
them
just
within
the
door
in
wet
weather
he
performed
these
functions
entirely
within
the
library
as
innocent
of
the
incongruity
of
his
position
as
my
guide
himself
oh
richard
of
bury
i
sighed
for
a
sharp
stone
from
your
sling
to
pierce
with
indignant
sarcasm
the
mental
armour
of
these
college
dullards
happily
things
are
altered
now
and
the
disgrace
of
such
neglect
no
longer
hangs
on
the
college
let
us
hope
in
these
days
of
revived
respect
for
antiquity
no
other
college
library
is
in
a
similar
plight
not
englishmen
alone
are
guilty
however
of
such
unloving
treatment
of
their
bibliographical
treasures
the
following
is
translated
from
an
interesting
work
just
published
in
paris
and
shows
how
even
at
this
very
time
and
in
the
centre
of
the
literary
activity
of
france
books
meet
their
fate

let
us
now
enter
the
communal
library
of
some
large
provincial
town
the
interior
has
a
lamentable
appearance
dust
and
disorder
have
made
it
their
home
it
has
a
librarian
but
he
has
the
consideration
of
a
porter
only
and
goes
but
once
a
week
to
see
the
state
of
the
books
committed
to
his
care
they
are
in
a
bad
state
piled
in
heaps
and
perishing
in
corners
for
want
of
attention
and

at
this
present
time
more
than
one
public
library
in

could
be
mentioned
in
which
thousands
of
books
are
received
annually
all
of
which
will
have
disappeared
in
the
course
of
years
or
so
for
want
of
binding
there
are
rare
books
impossible
to
replace
falling
to
pieces

no

is
given
to
them
that
is
to
say
they
are
left
unbound
a
prey
to
dust
and
the
worm
and
can
not
be
touched
without
dismemberment

shows
that
this
neglect
belongs
not

nation
i
extract
the
following
story
from

paris
the
poet
boccaccio
when
travelling
in
apulia
was
anxious
to
visit
the
celebrated
convent
of
mount
cassin
especially
to
see
its
library
of
which
he
had
heard
much
he
accosted
with
great
courtesy
one
of
the
monks
whose
countenance
attracted
him
and
begged
him
to
have
the
kindness
to
show
him
the
library
for
yourself
said
the
monk
brusquely
pointing
at
the
same
time
to
an
old
stone
staircase
broken
with
age
boccaccio
hastily
mounted
in
great
joy
at
the
prospect
of
a
grand
bibliographical
treat
soon
he
reached
the
room
which
was
without
key
or
even
door
as
protection
to
its
treasures
what
was
his
astonishment
to
see
that
the
grass
growing
in
the
actually
darkened
the
room
and
that
all
the
books
and
seats
were
an
inch
thick
in
dust
in
utter
astonishment
he
lifted
one
book
after
another
all
were
manuscripts
of
extreme
antiquity
but
all
were
dreadfully
dilapidated
many
had
lost
whole
sections
which
had
been
violently
extracted
and
in
many
all
the
blank
margins
of
the
vellum
had
been
cut
away
in
fact
the
mutilation
was
thorough
grieved
at
seeing
the
work
and
the
wisdom
of
so
many
illustrious
men
fallen
into
the
hands
of
custodians
so
unworthy
boccaccio
descended
with
tears
in
his
eyes
in
the
cloisters
he
met
another
monk
and
enquired
of
him
how
the
mss
had
become
so
mutilated
he
replied
are
obliged
you
know
to
earn
a
few
sous
for
our
needs
so
we
cut
away
the
blank
margins
of
the
manuscripts
for
writing
upon
and
make
of
them
small
books
of
devotion
which
we
sell
to
women
and
children
as
a
postscript
to
this
story
timmins
of
birmingham
informs
me
that
the
treasures
of
the
monte
cassino
library
are
better
cared
for
now
than
in
boccaccio
days
the
worthy
prior
being
proud
of
his
valuable
mss
and
very
willing
to
show
them
it
will
interest
many
readers
to
know
that
there
is
now
a
complete
printing
office
lithographic
as
well
as
typographic
at
full
work
in
one
large
room
of
the
monastery
where
their
wonderful
of
dante
has
been
already
reprinted
and
where
other
works
are
now

progress
chapter
ignorance
and
bigotry
ignorance
though
not
in
the
same
category
as
fire
and
water
is
a
great
destroyer
of
books
at
the
reformation
so
strong
was
the
antagonism
of
the
people
generally
to
anything
like
the
old
idolatry
of
the
romish
church
that
they
destroyed
by
thousands
books
secular
as
well
as
sacred
if
they
contained
but
illuminated
letters
unable
to
read
they
saw
no
difference
between
romance
and
a
psalter
between
king
arthur
and
king
david
and
so
the
paper
books
with
all
their
artistic
ornaments
went
to
the
bakers
to
heat
their
ovens
and
the
parchment
manuscripts
however
beautifully
illuminated
to
the
binders
and
boot
makers
there
is
another
kind
of
ignorance
which
has
often
worked
destruction
as
shown
by
the
following
anecdote
which
is
extracted
from
a
letter
written
in
by
philarete
chasles
to
beedham
of
kimbolton
ten
years
ago
when
turning
out
an
old
closet
in
the
mazarin
library
of
which
i
am
librarian
i
discovered
at
the
bottom
under
a
lot
of
old
rags
and
rubbish
a
large
volume
it
had
no
cover
nor
and
had
been
used
to
light
the
fires
of
the
librarians
this
shows
how
great
was
the
negligence
towards
our
literary
treasure
before
the
revolution
for
the
pariah
volume
which
years
before
had
been
placed
in
the
invalides
and
which
had
certainly
formed
part
of
the
original
mazarin
collections
turned
out
to
be
a
fine
and
genuine
caxton
i
saw
this
identical
volume
in
the
mazarin
library
in
april
it
is
a
noble
copy
of
the
first
edition
of
the
golden
legend
but
of
course
very
imperfect
among
the
millions
of
events
in
this
world
which
cross
and
one
another
remarkable
coincidences
must
often
occur
and
a
case
exactly
similar
to
that
at
the
mazarin
library
happened
about
the
same
time
in
london
at
the
french
protestant
church
many
years
ago
i
discovered
there
in
a
dirty
pigeon
hole
close
to
the
grate
in
the
vestry
a
fearfully
mutilated
copy
of
caxton
edition
of
the
canterbury
tales
with
woodcuts
like
the
book
at
paris
it
had
long
been
used
leaf
by
leaf
in
utter
ignorance
of
its
value
to
light
the
vestry
fire
originally
worth
at
least
it
was
then
worth
half
and
of
course
i
energetically
drew
the
attention
of
the
minister
in
charge
to
it
as
well
as
to
another
grand
folio
by
rood
and
hunte
some
years
elapsed
and
then
the
ecclesiastical
commissioners
took
the
foundation
in
hand
but
when
at
last
trustees
were
appointed
and
the
valuable
library
was
and
catalogued
this
caxton
together
with
the
fine
copy
of
latterbury
from
the
first
oxford
press
had
disappeared
entirely
whatever
ignorance
may
have
been
displayed
in
the
mutilation
quite
another
word
should
be
applied
to
the
disappearance
the
following
anecdote
is
so
that
although
it
has
lately
appeared
in
no
of
i
can
not
resist
the
temptation
of
it
as
a
warning
to
inheritors
of
old
libraries
the
account
was
copied
by
me
years
ago
from
a
letter
written
in
by
the
rev
newmarsh
rector
of
pelham
to
the
rev
maitland
librarian
to
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
and
is
as
follows
in
june
a
pedlar
called
at
a
cottage
in
blyton
and
asked
an
old
widow
named
naylor
whether
she
had
any
rags
to
sell
she
answered
no
but
offered
him
some
old
paper
and
took
from
a
shelf
the
of
albans
and
others
weighing
for
which
she
received
the
pedlar
carried
them
through
gainsborough
tied
up
in
string
past
a
chemist
shop
who
being
used
to
buy
old
paper
to
wrap
his
drugs
in
called
the
man
in
and
struck
by
the
appearance
of
the
gave
him
for
the
lot
not
being
able
to
read
the
colophon
he
took
it
to
an
equally
ignorant
stationer
and
offered
it
to
him
for
a
guinea
at
which
price
he
declined
it
but
proposed
that
it
should
be
exposed
in
his
window
as
a
means
of
eliciting
some
information
about
it
it
was
accordingly
placed
there
with
this
label
old
curious
work
a
collector
of
books
went
in
and
offered
for
it
which
excited
the
suspicion
of
the
vendor
soon
after
bird
vicar
of
gainsborough
went
in
and
asked
the
price
wishing
to
possess
a
very
early
specimen
of
printing
but
not
knowing
the
value
of
the
book
while
he
was
examining
it
stark
a
very
intelligent
bookseller
came
in
to
whom
bird
at
once
ceded
the
right
of
stark
betrayed
such
visible
anxiety
that
the
vendor
smith
declined
setting
a
price
soon
after
sir
anderson
of
lea
author
of
ancient
models
came
in
and
took
away
the
book
to
collate
but
brought
it
back
in
the
morning
having
found
it
imperfect
in
the
middle
and
offered
for
it
sir
charles
had
no
book
of
reference
to
guide
him
to
its
value
but
in
the
meantime
stark
had
employed
a
friend
to
obtain
for
him
the
refusal
of
it
and
had
undertaken
to
give
for
it
a
little
more
than
any
sum
sir
charles
might
offer
on
finding
that
at
least
could
be
got
for
it
smith
went
to
the
chemist
and
gave
him
two
guineas
and
then
sold
it
to
stark
agent
for
seven
guineas
stark
took
it
to
london
and
sold
it
at
once
to
the
rt
hon
thos
grenville
for
seventy
pounds
or
guineas
i
have
now
shortly
to
state
how
it
came
that
a
book
without
covers
of
such
extreme
age
was
preserved
about
fifty
years
since
the
library
of
thonock
hall
in
the
parish
of
gainsborough
the
seat
of
the
hickman
family
underwent
great
repairs
the
books
being
sorted
over
by
a
most
ignorant
person
whose
selection
seems
to
have
been
determined
by
the
coat
all
books
without
covers
were
thrown
into
a
great
heap
and
condemned
to
all
the
purposes
which
leland
laments
in
the
sack
of
the
conventual
libraries
by
the
visitors
but
they
found
favour
in
the
eyes
of
a
literate
gardener
who
begged
leave
to
take
what
he
liked
home
he
selected
a
large
quantity
of
sermons
preached
before
the
house
of
commons
local
pamphlets
tracts
from
to
opera
books
etc
he
made
a
list
of
them
which
i
found
afterwards
in
the
cottage
in
the
list
no
was
or
the
boke
of
albans
the
old
fellow
was
something
of
a
herald
and
drew
in
his
books
what
he
held
to
be
his
coat
after
his
death
all
that
could
be
stuffed
into
a
large
chest
were
put
away
in
a
garret
but
a
few
favourites
and
the
among
them
remained
on
the
kitchen
shelves
for
years
till
his
widow
grew
so
of
dusting
them
that
she
determined
to
sell
them
had
she
been
in
poverty
i
should
have
urged
the
buyer
stark
the
duty
of
giving
her
a
small
sum
out
of
his
great
gains
such
chances
as
this
do
not
fall
to
a
man
lot
twice
but
edmond
werdet
relates
a
story
very
similar
indeed
and
where
also
the
plums
fell
into
the
lap
of
a
london
dealer
in
the
recollet
monks
of
antwerp
wishing
to
make
a
reform
examined
their
library
and
determined
to
get
rid
of
about
volumes
some
manuscript
and
some
printed
but
all
of
which
they
considered
as
old
rubbish
of
no
value
at
first
they
were
thrown
into
the
gardener
rooms
but
after
some
months
they
decided
in
their
wisdom
to
give
the
whole
refuse
to
the
gardener
as
a
recognition
of
his
long
services
this
man
wiser
in
his
generation
than
these
simple
fathers
took
the
lot
to
vanderberg
an
amateur
and
man
of
education
vanderberg
took
a
cursory
view
and
then
offered
to
buy
them
by
weight
at
sixpence
per
pound
the
bargain
was
at
once
concluded
and
vanderberg
had
the
books
shortly
after
stark
a
london
bookseller
being
in
antwerp
called
on
vanderberg
and
was
shown
the
books
he
at
once
offered
francs
for
them
which
was
accepted
imagine
the
surprise
and
chagrin
of
the
poor
monks
when
they
heard
of
it
they
knew
they
had
no
remedy
and
so
dumbfounded
were
they
by
their
own
ignorance
that
they
humbly
requested
vanderberg
to
relieve
their
minds
by
returning
some
portion
of
his
large
gains
he
gave
them
francs
the
great
shakespearian
and
other
discoveries
which
were
found
in
a
garret
at
lamport
hall
in
by
edmonds
are
too
and
too
recent
to
need
description
in
this
case
mere
chance
seems
to
have
led
to
the
preservation
of
works
the
very
existence
of
which
set
the
ears
of
all
lovers
of
shakespeare
in
the
summer
of
a
gentleman
with
whom
i
was
well
acquainted
took
lodgings
in
preston
street
brighton
the
morning
after
his
arrival
he
found
in
the
some
leaves
of
an
old
book
he
asked
permission
to
retain
them
and
enquired
if
there
were
any
more
where
they
came
from
two
or
three
other
fragments
were
found
and
the
landlady
stated
that
her
father
who
was
fond
of
antiquities
had
at
one
time
a
chest
full
of
old
books
that
upon
his
death
they
were
preserved
till
she
was
tired
of
seeing
them
and
then
supposing
them
of
no
value
she
had
used
them
for
waste
that
for
two
years
and
they
had
served
for
various
household
purposes
but
she
had
just
come
to
the
end
of
them
the
fragments
preserved
and
now
in
my
possession
are
a
goodly
portion
of
one
of
the
most
rare
books
from
the
press
of
wynkyn
de
worde
caxton
successor
the
title
is
a
curious
woodcut
with
the
words
gesta
romanorum
engraved
in
an
black
letter
it
has
also
numerous
rude
throughout
it
was
from
this
very
work
that
shakespeare
in
all
probability
derived
the
story
of
the
three
caskets
which
in
the
merchant
of
venice
forms
so
integral
a
portion
of
the
plot
only
think
of
that
cloaca
being
supplied
daily
with
such
dainty
bibliographical
treasures
in
the
lansdowne
collection
at
the
british
museum
is
a
volume
containing
three
manuscript
dramas
of
queen
elizabeth
time
and
on
a
is
a
list
of
plays
with
this
note
at
the
foot
in
the
handwriting
of
the
antiquary
warburton
after
i
had
been
many
years
collecting
these
manuscript
playes
through
my
own
carelessness
and
the
ignorance
of
my
servant
they
was
unluckely
burned
or
put
under
pye
bottoms
some
of
these
playes
are
preserved
in
print
but
others
are
quite
unknown
and
perished
for
ever
when
used
as
rye
late
keeper
of
the
printed
books
at
our
great
national
library
thus
writes
on
the
subject
of
ignorance
you
should
some
day
when
at
the
british
museum
look
at
lydgate
translation
of
boccaccio
of
princes
printed
by
pynson
in
it
is
rarissimus
this
copy
when
perfect
had
been
very
fine
and
quite
uncut
on
one
fine
summer
afternoon
in
it
was
brought
to
me
by
a
tradesman
living
at
lamberhurst
many
of
the
leaves
had
been
cut
into
squares
and
the
whole
had
been
rescued
from
a
tobacconist
shop
where
the
pieces
were
being
used
to
wrap
up
tobacco
and
snuff
the
owner
wanted
to
buy
a
new
silk
gown
for
his
wife
and
was
delighted
with
three
guineas
for
this
purpose
you
will
notice
how
cleverly
the
british
museum
binder
has
joined
the
leaves
making
it
although
still
imperfect
a
fine
book
referring
to
the
carelessness
exhibited
by
some
custodians
of
parish
registers
noble
who
has
had
great
experience
in
such
matters
writes
a
few
months
ago
i
wanted
a
search
made
of
the
time
of
charles
i
in
one
of
the
most
interesting
registers
in
a
large
town
which
shall
be
nameless
in
england
i
wrote
to
the
custodian
of
it
and
asked
him
kindly
to
do
the
search
for
me
and
if
he
was
unable
to
read
the
names
to
get
some
one
who
understood
the
writing
of
that
date
to
decipher
the
entries
for
me
i
did
not
have
a
reply
for
a
fortnight
but
one
morning
the
postman
brought
me
a
very
large
unregistered
which
i
found
to
be
the
original
parish
registers
he
however
addressed
a
note
with
it
stating
that
he
thought
it
best
to
send
me
the
document
itself
to
look
at
and
begged
me
to
be
good
enough
to
return
the
register
to
him
as
soon
as
done
with
he
evidently
wished
to
serve
me
his
ignorance
of
responsibility
without
doubt
proving
his
kindly
disposition
and
on
that
account
alone
i
forbear
to
name
him
but
i
can
assure
you
i
was
heartily
glad
to
have
a
letter
from
him
in
due
time
announcing
that
the
precious
documents
were
once
more
locked
up
in
the
parish
chest
certainly
i
think
such
as
he
to
be
of
books
do
you
bigotry
has
also
many
sins
to
answer
for
the
late
muller
of
amsterdam
a
bookseller
of
european
fame
wrote
to
me
as
follows
a
few
weeks
before
his
death
of
course
we
also
in
holland
have
many
enemies
of
books
and
if
i
were
happy
enough
to
have
your
spirit
and
style
i
would
try
and
write
a
companion
volume
to
yours
now
i
think
the
best
thing
i
can
do
is
to
give
you
somewhat
of
my
experience
you
say
that
the
discovery
of
printing
has
made
the
destruction
of
anybody
books
difficult
at
this
i
am
bound
to
say
that
the
inquisition
did
succeed
most
successfully
by
burning
heretical
books
in
destroying
numerous
volumes
invaluable
for
their
wholesome
contents
indeed
i
beg
to
state
to
you
the
amazing
fact
that
here
in
holland
exists
an
ultramontane
society
called
paper
which
is
under
the
sanction
of
the
six
catholic
bishops
of
the
netherlands
and
is
spread
over
the
whole
kingdom
the
object
of
this
society
is
to
buy
up
and
to
destroy
as
waste
paper
all
the
protestant
and
liberal
catholic
newspapers
pamphlets
and
books
the
price
of
which
is
offered
to
the
pope
as
de
st
pierre
of
course
this
society
is
very
little
known
among
protestants
and
many
have
denied
even
its
existence
but
i
have
been
fortunate
enough
to
obtain
a
printed
circular
issued
by
one
of
the
bishops
containing
statistics
of
the
astounding
mass
of
paper
thus
collected
producing
in
one
district
alone
the
sum
of
in
three
months
i
need
not
tell
you
that
this
work
is
strongly
promoted
by
the
catholic
clergy
you
can
have
no
idea
of
the
difficulty
we
now
have
in
procuring
certain
books
published
but
or
years
ago
of
an
ephemeral
character
historical
and
theological
books
are
very
rare
novels
and
poetry
of
that
period
are
absolutely
not
to
be
found
medical
and
law
books
are
more
common
i
am
bound
to
say
that
in
no
country
have
more
books
been
printed
and
more
destroyed
than
in
holland
w
muller
the
policy
of
buying
up
all
objectionable
literature
seems
to
me
i
confess
very
and
in
most
cases
would
lead
to
a
greatly
increased
reprint
it
certainly
would
in
these
latitudes
from
the
church
of
rome
to
the
church
of
england
is
no
great
leap
and
smith
the
brighton
bookseller
gives
evidence
thus
it
may
be
worth
your
while
to
note
that
the
clergy
of
the
last
two
centuries
ought
to
be
included
in
your
list
of
biblioclasts
i
have
had
painful
experience
of
the
fact
in
the
following
manner
numbers
of
volumes
in
their
libraries
have
had
a
few
leaves
removed
and
in
many
others
whole
sections
torn
out
i
suppose
it
served
their
purpose
thus
to
use
the
wisdom
of
greater
men
and
that
they
thus
economised
their
own
time
by
tearing
out
portions
to
suit
their
purpose
the
hardship
to
the
trade
is
this
their
books
are
purchased
in
good
faith
as
perfect
and
when
resold
the
buyer
is
quick
to
claim
damage
if
found
defective
while
the
seller
has
no
redress
among
the
careless
destroyers
of
books
still
at
work
should
be
classed
government
officials
of
interesting
documents
bound
and
unbound
have
been
sold
at
various
times
as
when
modern
thought
them
but
rubbish
some
of
them
have
been
rescued
and
resold
at
high
prices
but
some
have
been
lost
for
ever
nell
gwyn
private
housekeeping
book
was
among
them
containing
most
curious
particulars
of
what
was
necessary
in
the
time
of
charles
i
for
a
princely
household
fortunately
it
was
among
the
rescued
and
is
now
in
a
private
library
in
a
very
interesting
series
of
blue
books
was
commenced
by
the
authorities
of
the
patent
office
of
course
paid
for
out
of
the
national
purse
beginning
with
the
year
the
particulars
of
every
important
patent
were
printed
from
the
original
specifications
and
drawings
made
where
necessary
for
the
elucidation
of
the
text
a
very
moderate
price
was
charged
for
each
only
indeed
the
prime
cost
of
production
the
general
public
of
course
cared
little
for
such
literature
but
those
interested
in
the
origin
and
progress
of
any
particular
art
cared
much
and
many
sets
of
patents
were
purchased
by
those
engaged
in
research
but
the
great
bulk
of
the
stock
was
to
some
extent
inconvenient
and
so
when
a
removal
to
other
offices
in
became
necessary
the
question
arose
as
to
what
could
be
done
with
them
these
which
had
cost
the
nation
many
thousands
of
pounds
were
positively
sold
to
the
paper
mills
as
wastepaper
and
nearly
tons
weight
were
carted
away
at
about
per
ton
it
is
difficult
to
believe
although
positively
true
that
so
great
an
act
of
vandalism
could
have
been
perpetrated
even
in
a
government
office
it
is
true
that
no
demand
existed
for
some
of
them
but
it
is
equally
true
that
in
numerous
cases
especially
in
the
early
specifications
of
the
steam
engine
and
printing
machine
the
want
of
them
has
caused
great
disappointment
to
add
a
climax
to
the
story
many
of
the
pulped
specifications
have
had
to
be
reprinted
more
than
once
since
their
destruction
chapter

the

there
is
a
sort
of
busy
worm
that
will
the
fairest

deform

gnawing

throughout

through
every

they
go
yet
of
its

they

is
bread
to
the
poor

defiance
doraston
a
most
destructive
enemy
of
books
has
been
the
bookworm
i
say
has
been
because
fortunately
his
ravages
in
all
civilised
countries
have
been
greatly
restricted
during
the
last
fifty
years
this
is
due
partly
to
the
increased
reverence
for
antiquity
which
has
been
universally
developed
more
still
to
the
feeling
of
cupidity
which
has
caused
all
owners
to
take
care
of
volumes
which
year
by
year
have
become
more
valuable
and
to
some
considerable
extent
to
the
falling
off
in
the
production
of
edible
books
the
monks
who
were
the
chief
makers
as
well
as
the
custodians
of

long

call

at
that
time

was
not
whether
at
a
still
earlier
period
he
attacked
the

the
paper
of
the
egyptians
i
know
not
probably
he
did
as
it
was
a
purely
vegetable
substance
and
if
so
it
is
quite
possible
that
the
worm
of
in
such
evil
repute
with
us
is
the
lineal
descendant
of
ravenous
ancestors
who
plagued
the
sacred
priests
of

time

destroying
their

were
packed

an
account

examined
by

under

is
most
interesting
for
the
frequent
accuracy

conversant
among
books
and
papers
and
is
supposed
to
be
that
which
corrodes
and
eats
holes
thro
the
leaves
and
covers
its
head
appears
bigg
and
blunt
and
its
body
tapers
from
it
towards
the
tail
smaller
and
smaller
being
shap
almost
like
a
carret
it
has
two
long
horns
before
which
are
streight
and
tapering
towards
the
top
curiously
ring
or
knobb
and
brisled
much
like
the
marsh
weed
called
horses
tail
the
hinder
part
is
terminated
with
three
tails
in
every
particular
resembling
the
two
longer
horns
that
grow
out
of
the
head
the
legs
are
scal
and
hair
this
animal
probably
feeds
upon
the
paper
and
covers
of
books
and
perforates
in
them
several
small
round
holes
finding
perhaps
a
convenient
nourishment
in
those
husks
of
hemp
and
flax
which
have
passed
through
so
many
scourings
washings
dressings
and
dryings
as
the
parts
of
old
paper
necessarily
have
suffer
and
indeed
when
i
consider
what
a
heap
of
sawdust
or
chips
this
little
creature
which
is
one
of
the
teeth
of
time
conveys
into
its
intrals
i
can
not
chuse
but
remember
and
admire
the
excellent
contrivance
of
nature
in
placing
in
animals
such
a
fire
as
is
continually
nourished
and
supply
by
the
materials
convey
into
the
stomach
and
fomented
by
the
bellows
of
the
lungs
the
picture
or
image
which
accompanies
this
description
is
wonderful
to
behold
certainly
hooke
fellow
of
the
royal
society
drew
somewhat
upon
his
imagination
here
having
apparently
evolved
both
engraving
and
description
from
his
inner
consciousness
not
so
several
correspondents
have
drawn
my
attention
to
the
fact
that
hooke
is
evidently
describing
the
lepisma
which
if
not
positively
injurious
is
often
found
in
the
warm
places
of
old
houses
especially
if
a
little
damp
he
mistook
this
for
the
bookworm
entomologists
even
do
not
appear
to
have
paid
much
attention
to
the
natural
history
of
the
worm
kirby
speaking
of
it
says
the
larvae
of
crambus
pinguinalis
spins
a
robe
which
it
covers
with
its
own
excrement
and
does
no
little
injury
again
i
have
often
observed
the
caterpillar
of
a
little
moth
that
takes
its
station
in
damp
old
books
and
there
commits
great
ravages
and
many
a
rarity
which
in
these
days
of
bibliomania
would
have
been
valued
at
its
weight
in
gold
has
been
snatched
by
these
devastators
etc
as
already
quoted
doraston
description
is
very
vague
to
him
he
is
in
one
verse
a
sort
of
busy
worm
and
in
another
a
puny
rankling
reptile
hannett
in
his
work
on
gives
aglossa
pinguinalis
as
the
real
name
and
gatty
in
her
parables
christens
it
hypothenemus
cruditus
the
rev
havergal
who
many
years
ago
had
much
trouble
with
bookworms
in
the
cathedral
library
of
hereford
says
they
are
a
kind
of
with
a
hard
outer
skin
and
are
dark
brown
another
sort
having
white
bodies
with
brown
spots
on
their
heads
holme
in
notes
and
queries
for
states
that
the
anobium
paniceum
has
done
considerable
injury
to
the
arabic
manuscripts
brought
from
cairo
by
burckhardt
and
now
in
the
university
library
cambridge
other
writers
say
acarus
eruditus
or
anobium
pertinax
are
the
correct
scientific
names
personally
i
have
come
across
but
few
specimens
nevertheless
from
what
i
have
been
told
by
librarians
and
judging
from
analogy
i
imagine
the
following
to
be
about
the
truth
there
are
several
kinds
of
caterpillar
and
grub
which
eat
into
books
those
with
legs
are
the
larvae
of
moths
those
without
legs
or
rather
with
rudimentary
legs
are
grubs
and
turn
to
beetles
it
is
not
known
whether
any
species
of
caterpillar
or
grub
can
live
generation
after
generation
upon
books
alone
but
several
sorts
of
and
others
which
live
upon
vegetable
refuse
will
attack
paper
especially
if
attracted
in
the
first
place
by
the
real
wooden
boards
in
which
it
was
the
custom
of
the
old
to
clothe
their
volumes
in
this
belief
some
country
librarians
object
to
opening
the
library
windows
lest
the
enemy
should
fly
in
from
the
neighbouring
woods
and
rear
a
brood
of
worms
anyone
indeed
who
has
seen
a
hole
in
a
filbert
or
a
piece
of
wood
riddled
by
dry
rot
will
recognize
a
similarity
of
appearance
in
the
channels
made
by
these
insect
enemies
among
the
species
are
the
anobium
of
this
beetle
there
are
varieties
viz
pertinax
eruditus
and
a
paniceum
in
the
larval
state
they
are
grubs
just
like
those
found
in
nuts
in
this
stage
they
are
too
much
alike
to
be
distinguished
from
one
another
they
feed
on
old
dry
wood
and
often
infest
bookcases
and
shelves
they
eat
the
wooden
boards
of
old
books
and
so
pass
into
the
paper
where
they
make
long
holes
quite
round
except
when
they
work
in
a
slanting
direction
when
the
holes
appear
to
be
oblong
they
will
thus
pierce
through
several
volumes
in
succession
peignot
the
bibliographer
having
found
volumes
so
pierced
in
a
straight
line
by
one
worm
a
miracle
of
gluttony
the
story
of
which
for
myself
i
receive
grano
after
a
certain
time
the
larva
changes
into
a
pupa
and
then
emerges
as
a
small
brown
beetle
oecophora
this
larva
is
similar
in
size
to
that
of
anobium
but
can
be
distinguished
at
once
by
having
legs
it
is
a
caterpillar
with
six
legs
upon
its
thorax
and
eight
protuberances
on
its
body
like
a
it
changes
into
a
chrysalis
and
then
assumes
its
perfect
shape
as
a
small
brown
moth
the
species
that
attacks
books
is
the
oecophora
pseudospretella
it
loves
damp
and
warmth
and
eats
any
fibrous
material
this
caterpillar
is
quite
unlike
any
garden
species
and
excepting
the
legs
is
very
similar
in
appearance
and
size
to
the
anobium
it
is
about
long
with
a
horny
head
and
strong
jaws
to
printers
ink
or
writing
ink
he
appears
to
have
no
great
dislike
though
i
imagine
that
the
former
often
disagrees
with
his
health
unless
he
is
very
robust
as
in
books
where
the
print
is
pierced
a
majority
of
the
i
have
seen
are
too
short
in
extent
to
have
provided
food
enough
for
the
development
of
the
grub
but
although
the
ink
may
be
unwholesome
many
grubs
survive
and
eating
day
and
night
in
silence
and
darkness
work
out
their
destiny
leaving
according
to
the
strength
of
their
constitutions
a
longer
or
shorter
tunnel
in
the
volume
in
december
birdsall
a
of
northampton
kindly
sent
me
by
post
a
fat
little
worm
which
had
been
found
by
one
of
his
workmen
in
an
old
book
while
being
bound
he
bore
his
journey
extremely
well
being
very
lively
when
turned
out
i
placed
him
in
a
box
in
warmth
and
quiet
with
some
small
fragments
of
paper
from
a
boethius
printed
by
caxton
and
a
leaf
of
a
seventeenth
century
book
he
ate
a
small
piece
of
the
leaf
but
either
from
too
much
fresh
air
from
unaccustomed
liberty
or
from
change
of
food
he
gradually
weakened
and
died
in
about
three
weeks
i
was
sorry
to
lose
him
as
i
wished
to
verify
his
name
in
his
perfect
state
waterhouse
of
the
entomological
department
of
the
british
museum
very
kindly
examined
him
before
death
and
was
of
opinion
he
was
oecophora
pseudospretella
in
july
garnett
of
the
british
museum
gave
me
two
worms
which
had
been
found
in
an
old
hebrew
commentary
just
received
from
athens
they
had
doubtless
had
a
good
shaking
on
the
journey
and
one
was
moribund
when
i
took
charge
and
joined
his
defunct
kindred
in
a
few
days
the
other
seemed
hearty
and
lived
with
me
for
nearly
eighteen
months
i
treated
him
as
well
as
i
knew
how
placed
him
in
a
small
box
with
the
choice
of
three
sorts
of
old
paper
to
eat
and
very
seldom
disturbed
him
he
evidently
resented
his
confinement
ate
very
little
moved
very
little
and
changed
in
appearance
very
little
even
when
dead
this
greek
worm
filled
with
hebrew
lore
differed
in
many
respects
from
any
other
i
have
seen
he
was
longer
thinner
and
more
delicate
looking
than
any
of
his
english
congeners
he
was
transparent
like
thin
ivory
and
had
a
dark
line
through
his
body
which
i
took
to
be
the
intestinal
canal
he
resigned
his
life
with
extreme
procrastination
and
died
deeply
lamented
by
his
keeper
who
had
long
looked
forward
to
his
final
development
the
difficulty
of
breeding
these
worms
is
probably
due
to
their
formation
when
in
a
state
of
nature
they
can
by
expansion
and
contraction
of
the
body
working
upon
the
sides
of
their
holes
push
their
horny
jaws
against
the
opposing
mass
of
paper
but
when
freed
from
the
restraint
which
indeed
to
them
is
life
they
can
not
eat
although
surrounded
with
food
for
they
have
no
legs
to
keep
them
steady
and
their
natural
leverage
is
wanting
considering
the
numerous
old
books
contained
in
the
british
museum
the
library
there
is
wonderfully
free
from
the
worm
rye
lately
the
keeper
of
the
printed
books
there
writes
me
two
or
three
were
discovered
in
my
time
but
they
were
weakly
creatures
one
i
remember
was
conveyed
into
the
natural
history
department
and
was
taken
into
custody
by
adam
white
who
pronounced
it
to
be
anobium
pertinax
i
never
heard
of
it
after
the
reader
who
has
not
had
an
opportunity
of
examining
old
libraries
can
have
no
idea
of
the
dreadful
havoc
which
these
pests
are
capable
of
making
i
have
now
before
me
a
fine
folio
volume
printed
on
very
good
unbleached
paper
as
thick
as
stout
cartridge
in
the
year
by
peter
schoeffer
of
mentz
unfortunately
after
a
period
of
neglect
in
which
it
suffered
severely
from
the
worm
it
was
about
fifty
years
ago
considered
worth
a
new
cover
and
so
again
suffered
severely
this
time
at
the
hands
of
the
binder
thus
the
original
state
of
the
boards
is
unknown
but
the
damage
done
to
the
leaves
can
be
accurately
described
the
worms
have
attacked
each
end
on
the
first
leaf
are
distinct
holes
varying
in
size
from
a
common
pin
hole
to
that
which
a
stout
would
make
say
to
inch
these
holes
run
mostly
in
lines
more
or
less
at
right
angles
with
the
covers
a
very
few
being
channels
along
the
paper
affecting
three
or
four
sheets
only
the
varied
energy
of
these
little
pests
is
thus
represented
on
folio
are
holes
on
folio
are
these
leaves
being
stout
are
about
the
thickness
of
inch
the
volume
has
leaves
and
turning
to
the
end
we
find
on
the
last
leaf
holes
made
by
a
breed
of
worms
not
so
ravenous
thus
from
end
from
end
on
folio
are
holes
on
folio
is
it
is
curious
to
notice
how
the
holes
rapidly
at
first
and
then
slowly
and
more
slowly
disappear
you
trace
the
same
hole
leaf
after
leaf
until
suddenly
the
size
becomes
in
one
leaf
reduced
to
half
its
normal
diameter
and
a
close
examination
will
show
a
small
abrasion
of
the
paper
in
the
next
leaf
exactly
where
the
hole
would
have
come
if
continued
in
the
book
quoted
it
is
just
as
if
there
had
been
a
race
in
the
first
ten
leaves
the
weak
worms
are
left
behind
in
the
second
ten
there
are
still
eaters
these
are
reduced
to
in
the
third
ten
and
to
only
eighteen
in
the
fourth
ten
on
folio
only
six
worms
hold
on
and
before
folio
two
of
them
have
given
in
before
reaching
folio
it
is
a
neck
and
neck
race
between
two
sturdy
gourmands
each
making
a
fine
large
hole
one
of
them
being
oval
in
shape
at
folio
they
are
still
neck
and
neck
and
at
folio
the
same
at
folio
the
oval
worm
gives
in
the
round
one
eating
three
more
leaves
and
part
way
through
the
fourth
the
leaves
of
the
book
are
then
untouched
until
we
reach
the
from
the
end
upon
which
is
one
worm
hole
after
this
they
go
on
multiplying
to
the
end
of
the
book
i
have
quoted
this
instance
because
i
have
it
handy
but
many
worms
eat
much
longer
holes
than
any
in
this
volume
some
i
have
seen
running
quite
through
a
couple
of
thick
volumes
covers
and
all
in
the
schoeffer
book
the
holes
are
probably
the
work
of
anobium
pertinax
because
the
centre
is
spared
and
both
ends
attacked
originally
real
wooden
boards
were
the
covers
of
the
volume
and
here
doubtless
the
attack
was
commenced
which
was
carried
through
each
board
into
the
paper
of
the
book
i
remember
well
my
first
visit
to
the
bodleian
library
in
the
year
bandinel
being
then
the
librarian
he
was
very
kind
and
afforded
me
every
facility
for
examining
the
fine
collection
of
caxtons
which
was
the
object
of
my
journey
in
looking
over
a
parcel
of
fragments
which
had
been
in
a
drawer
for
a
long
time
i
came
across
a
small
grub
which
without
a
thought
i
threw
on
the
floor
and
trod
under
foot
soon
after
i
found
another
a
fat
glossy
fellow
so
long
which
i
carefully
preserved
in
a
little
paper
box
intending
to
observe
his
habits
and
development
seeing
bandinel
near
i
asked
him
to
look
at
my
curiosity
hardly
however
had
i
turned
the
wriggling
little
victim
out
upon
the
table
when
down
came
the
doctor
great
upon
him
and
an
smear
proved
the
tomb
of
all
my
hopes
while
the
great
bibliographer
wiping
his
thumb
on
his
coat
sleeve
passed
on
with
the
remark
oh
yes
they
have
black
heads
sometimes
that
was
something
to
know
another
fact
for
the
entomologist
for
my
little
gentleman
had
a
hard
shiny
white
head
and
i
never
heard
of
a
bookworm
before
or
since
perhaps
the
great
abundance
of
books
in
the
bodleian
may
account
for
the
variety
at
any
rate
he
was
an
anobium
i
have
been
unmercifully
chaffed
for
the
absurd
idea
that
a
worm
could
be
kept
a
prisoner
in
a
paper
box
oh
these
critics
your
bookworm
is
a
shy
lazy
beast
and
takes
a
day
or
two
to
recover
his
appetite
after
being
evicted
moreover
he
knew
his
own
dignity
better
than
to
eat
the
loaded
glazed
shoddy
note
paper
in
which
he
was
incarcerated
in
the
case
of
caxton
lyf
of
oure
ladye
already
referred
to
not
only
are
there
numerous
small
holes
but
some
very
large
channels
at
the
bottom
of
the
pages
this
is
a
most
unusual
occurrence
and
is
probably
the
work
of
the
larva
of
dermestes
vulpinus
a
garden
beetle
which
is
very
voracious
and
eats
any
kind
of
dry
ligneous
rubbish
the
scarcity
of
edible
books
of
the
present
century
has
been
mentioned
one
result
of
the
extensive
adulteration
of
modern
paper
is
that
the
worm
will
not
touch
it
his
instinct
forbids
him
to
eat
the
china
clay
the
bleaches
the
plaster
of
paris
the
sulphate
of
barytes
the
scores
of
adulterants
now
used
to
mix
with
the
fibre
and
so
far
the
wise
pages
of
the
old
literature
are
in
the
race
against
time
with
the
modern
rubbish
heavily
handicapped
thanks
to
the
general
interest
taken
in
old
books
the
worm
has
hard
times
of
it
and
but
slight
chance
of
that
quiet
neglect
which
is
necessary
to
his
existence
so
much
greater
is
the
reason
why
some
patient
entomologist
should
while
there
is
the
chance
take
upon
himself
to
study
the
habits
of
the
creature
as
sir
john
lubbock
has
those
of
the
ant
i
have
now
before
me
some
leaves
of
a
book
which
being
waste
were
used
by
our
economical
first
printer
caxton
to
make
boards
by
pasting
them
together
whether
the
old
paste
was
an
attraction
or
whatever
the
reason
may
have
been
the
worm
when
he
got
in
there
did
not
as
usual
eat
straight
through
everything
into
the
middle
of
the
book
but
worked
his
way
longitudinally
eating
great
furrows
along
the
leaves
without
passing
out
of
the
binding
and
so
furrowed
are
these
few
leaves
by
long
channels
that
it
is
difficult
to
raise
one
of
them
without
its
falling
to
pieces
this
is
bad
enough
but
we
may
be
very
thankful
that
in
these
temperate
climes
we
have
no
such
enemies
as
are
found
in
very
hot
countries
where
a
whole
library
books
bookshelves
table
chairs
and
all
may
be
destroyed
in
one
night
by
a
countless
army
of
ants
our
cousins
in
the
united
states
so
fortunate
in
many
things
seem
very
fortunate
in
this
their
books
are
not
attacked
by
the
worm
at
any
rate
american
writers
say
so
true
it
is
that
all
their
comes
from
europe
and
having
cost
many
dollars
is
well
looked
after
but
there
they
have
thousands
of
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
century
books
in
roman
type
printed
in
the
states
on
genuine
and
wholesome
paper
and
the
worm
is
not
particular
at
least
in
this
country
about
the
type
he
eats
through
if
the
paper
is
good
probably
therefore
the
custodians
of
their
old
libraries
could
tell
a
different
tale
which
makes
it
all
the
more
amusing
to
find
in
the
excellent
encyclopaedia
of
printing
edited
and
printed
by
ringwalt
at
philadelphia
not
only
that
the
bookworm
is
a
stranger
there
for
personally
he
is
unknown
to
most
of
us
but
that
his
slightest
ravages
are
looked
upon
as
both
curious
and
rare
after
quoting
dibdin
with
the
addition
of
a
few
flights
of
imagination
of
his
own
ringwalt
states
that
this
moth
is
supposed
to
have
been
introduced
into
england
in
hogsleather
binding
from
holland
he
then
ends
with
what
to
anyone
who
has
seen
the
ravages
of
the
worm
in
hundreds
of
books
must
be
charming
in
its
native
simplicity
there
is
now
he
states
evidently
quoting
it
as
a
great
curiosity
there
is
now
in
a
private
library
in
philadelphia
a
book
perforated
by
this
insect
oh
lucky
philadelphians
who
can
boast
of
possessing
the
oldest
library
in
the

must
ask
leave
of
a
private
collector

they

other
vermin
besides
the

i
do
not
think
there
is
any
insect
enemy
of
books
worth
description
the
domestic
or
cockroach
is
far
too
modern
an
introduction
to
our
country
to
have
done
much
harm
though
he
will
sometimes
nibble
the
binding
of
books
especially
if
they
rest
upon
the
floor
not
so
fortunate
however
are
our
american
cousins
for
in
the
library
journal
for
september
weston
flint
gives
an
account
of
a
dreadful
little
pest
which
commits
great
havoc
upon
the
cloth
bindings
of
the
new
york
libraries
it
is
a
small
or
cockroach
called
by
scientists
blatta
germanica
and
by
others
the
croton
bug
unlike
our
household
pest
whose
home
is
the
kitchen
and
whose
bashfulness
loves
secrecy
and
the
dark
hours
this
misgrown
flat
species
of
which
it
would
take
two
to
make
a
english
specimen
has
gained
in
impudence
what
it
has
lost
in
size
fearing
neither
light
nor
noise
neither
man
nor
beast
in
the
old
english
bible
of
we
read
in
psalm
xci
thou
shalt
not
nede
to
be
afraied
for
eny
bugges
by
night
this
verse
falls
unheeded
on
the
ear
of
the
western
librarian
who
fears
his
bugs
both
night
and
day
for
they
crawl
over
everything
in
broad
sunlight
infesting
and
infecting
each
corner
and
cranny
of
the
bookshelves
they
choose
as
their
home
there
is
a
remedy
in
the
powder
known
as
insecticide
which
however
is
very
disagreeable
upon
books
and
shelves
it
is
nevertheless
very
fatal
to
these
pests
and
affords
some
consolation
in
the
fact
that
so
soon
as
a
bug
shows
any
signs
of
illness
he
is
devoured
at
once
by
his
voracious
brethren
with
the
same
relish
as
if
he
were
made
of
fresh
paste
there
is
too
a
small
silvery
insect
lepisma
which
i
have
often
seen
in
the
backs
of
neglected
books
but
his
ravages
are
not
of
much
importance
nor
can
we
reckon
the
codfish
as
very
dangerous
to
literature
unless
indeed
he
be
of
the
roman
obedience
like
that
wonderful
ichthiobibliophage
pardon
me
professor
owen
who
in
the
year
swallowed
three
puritanical
treatises
of
john
frith
the
protestant
martyr
no
wonder
after
such
a
meal
he
was
soon
caught
and
became
famous
in
the
annals
of
literature
the
following
is
the
title
of
a
little
book
issued
upon
the
occasion
vox
piscis
or
the
containing
three
treatises
which
were
found
in
the
belly
of
a
in
cambridge
market
on
midsummer
eve
ad
lowndes
says
see
under
tracey
great
was
the
consternation
at
cambridge
upon
the
publication
of
this
work
rats
and
mice
however
are
occasionally
very
destructive
as
the
following
anecdote
will
show
two
centuries
ago
the
library
of
the
dean
and
chapter
of
westminster
was
kept
in
the
chapter
house
and
repairs
having
become
necessary
in
that
building
a
scaffolding
was
erected
inside
the
books
being
left
on
their
shelves
one
of
the
holes
made
in
the
wall
for
a
was
selected
by
a
pair
of
rats
for
their
family
residence
here
they
formed
a
nest
for
their
young
ones
by
descending
to
the
library
shelves
and
biting
away
the
leaves
of
various
books
snug
and
comfortable
was
the
little
household
until
one
day
the
builder
men
having
finished
the
poles
were
removed
and
alas
for
the
rats
the
hole
was
closed
up
with
bricks
and
cement
buried
alive
the
father
and
mother
with
five
or
six
of
their
offspring
met
with
a
speedy
death
and
not
until
a
few
years
ago
when
a
restoration
of
the
chapter
house
was
effected
was
the
rat
grave
opened
again
for
a
scaffold
pole
and
all
their
skeletons
and
their
nest
discovered
their
bones
and
paper
fragments
of
the
nest
may
now
be
seen
in
a
glass
case
in
the
chapter
house
some
of
the
fragments
being
attributed
to
books
from
the
press
of
caxton
this
is
not
the
case
although
there
are
pieces
of
very
early
books
not
now
to
be
found
in
the
abbey
library
including
little
bits
of
the
famous
queen
elizabeth
prayer
book
with
woodcuts
a
friend
sends
me
the
following
incident
a
few
years
since
some
rats
made
nests
in
the
trees
surrounding
my
house
from
thence
they
jumped
on
to
some
flat
roofing
and
so
made
their
way
down
a
chimney
into
a
room
where
i
kept
books
a
number
of
these
with
parchment
backs
they
entirely
destroyed
as
well
as
some
books
whole
bound
in
parchment
another
friend
informs
me
that
in
the
natural
history
museum
of
the
devon
and
exeter
institution
is
a
specimen
of
another
little
pest
which
has
a
great
affection
for
bindings
in
calf
and
roan
its
scientific
name
is
niptus
hololeucos
he
adds
are
you
aware
that
there
was
a
terrible
creature
allied
to
these
rejoicing
in
the
name
of
tomicus
typographus
which
committed
sad
ravages
in
germany
in
the
seventeenth
century
and
in
the
old
liturgies
of
that
country
is
formally
mentioned
under
its
vulgar
name
turk
see
kirby
and
spence
seventh
edition
p
this
is
curious
and
i
did
not
know
it
although
i
know
well
that
typographus
tomicus
or
the
cutting
printer
is
a
sad
enemy
of
good
books
upon
this
part
of
our
subject
however
i
am
debarred
entering
the
following
is
from
westbrook
mus
and
represents
ravages
with
which
i
am
personally
unacquainted
dear
blades
i
send
you
an
example
of
the
of
an
ordinary
housefly
it
hid
behind
the
paper
emitted
some
caustic
fluid
and
then
departed
this
life
i
have
often
caught
them
in
such
holes
the
damage
is
an
oblong
hole
surrounded
by
a
white
fluffy
glaze
fungoid
difficult
to
represent
in
a
woodcut
the
size
here
given
is
exact
chapter
viii
bookbinders
in
the
first
chapter
i
mentioned
bookbinders
among
the
enemies
of
books
and
i
tremble
to
think
what
a
stinging
retort
might
be
made
if
some
irate
bibliopegist
were
to
turn
the
scales
on
the
printer
and
place
him
in
the
same
category
on
the
sins
of
printers
and
the
unnatural
neglect
which
has
often
shortened
the
lives
of
their
typographical
progeny
it
is
not
for
me
to
dilate
there
is
an
old
proverb
is
an
ill
bird
that
befouls
its
own
nest
a
curious
chapter
thereupon
with
many
modern
examples
might
nevertheless
be
written
this
i
will
leave
and
will
now
only
place
on
record
some
of
the
cruelties
perpetrated
upon
books
by
the
ignorance
or
carelessness
of
binders
like
men
books
have
a
soul
and
body
with
the
soul
or
literary
portion
we
have
nothing
to
do
at
present
the
body
which
is
the
outer
frame
or
covering
and
without
which
the
inner
would
be
unusable
is
the
special
work
of
the
binder
he
so
to
speak
begets
it
he
determines
its
form
and
adornment
he
doctors
it
in
disease
and
decay
and
not
unseldom
dissects
it
after
death
here
too
as
through
all
nature
we
find
the
good
and
bad
running
side
by
side
what
a
treat
it
is
to
handle
a
volume
the
leaves
lie
open
fully
and
freely
as
if
tempting
you
to
read
on
and
you
handle
them
without
fear
of
their
parting
from
the
back
to
look
at
the
tooling
too
is
a
pleasure
for
careful
thought
combined
with
artistic
skill
is
everywhere
apparent
you
open
the
cover
and
find
the
same
loving
attention
inside
that
has
been
given
to
the
outside
all
the
workmanship
being
true
and
thorough
indeed
so
conservative
is
a
good
binding
that
many
a
worthless
book
has
had
an
honoured
old
age
simply
out
of
respect
to
its
outward
aspect
and
many
a
real
treasure
has
come
to
a
degraded
end
and
premature
death
through
the
unsightliness
of
its
outward
case
and
the
irreparable
damage
done
to
it
in
binding
the
weapon
with
which
the
binder
deals
the
most
deadly
blows
to
books
is
the
plough
the
effect
of
which
is
to
cut
away
the
margins
placing
the
print
in
a
false
position
relatively
to
the
back
and
head
and
often
denuding
the
work
of
portions
of
the
very
text
this
reduction
in
size
not
seldom
brings
down
a
handsome
folio
to
the
size
of
quarto
and
a
quarto
to
an
octavo
with
the
old
hand
plough
a
binder
required
more
care
and
caution
to
produce
an
even
edge
throughout
than
with
the
new
cutting
machine
if
a
careless
workman
found
that
he
had
not
ploughed
the
margin
quite
square
with
the
text
he
would
put
it
in
his
press
and
take
off
another
shaving
and
sometimes
even
a
third
dante
in
his
inferno
deals
out
to
the
lost
souls
various
tortures
suited
with
dramatic
fitness
to
the
past
crimes
of
the
victims
and
had
i
to
execute
judgment
on
the
criminal
binders
of
certain
precious
volumes
i
have
seen
where
the
untouched
maiden
sheets
entrusted
to
their
care
have
by
barbarous
treatment
lost
dignity
beauty
and
value
i
would
collect
the
paper
shavings
so
ruthlessly
shorn
off
and
roast
the
perpetrator
of
the
outrage
over
their
slow
combustion
in
olden
times
before
men
had
learned
to
value
the
relics
of
our
printers
there
was
some
excuse
for
the
sins
of
a
binder
who
erred
from
ignorance
which
was
general
but
in
these
times
when
the
historical
and
antiquarian
value
of
old
books
is
freely
acknowledged
no
quarter
should
be
granted
to
a
careless
culprit
it
may
be
supposed
that
from
the
spread
of
information
all
real
danger
from
ignorance
is
past
not
so
good
reader
that
is
a
consummation
as
yet
devoutly
to
be
wished
let
me
relate
to
you
a
true
bibliographical
anecdote
in
a
certain
lord
who
had
succeeded
to
a
fine
collection
of
old
books
promised
to
send
some
of
the
most
valuable
among
which
were
several
caxtons
to
the
exhibition
at
south
kensington
thinking
their
outward
appearance
too
shabby
and
not
knowing
the
danger
of
his
conduct
he
decided
to
have
them
rebound
in
the
neighbouring
county
town
the
volumes
were
soon
returned
in
a
resplendent
state
and
it
is
said
quite
to
the
satisfaction
of
his
lordship
whose
pleasure
however
was
sadly
damped
when
a
friend
pointed
out
to
him
that
although
the
discoloured
edges
had
all
been
ploughed
off
and
the
blanks
with
their
fifteenth
century
autographs
had
been
replaced
by
nice
clean
yet
looking
at
the
result
in
its
lowest
aspect
only
that
of
market
value
the
books
had
been
damaged
to
at
least
the
amount
of
and
moreover
that
caustic
remarks
would
most
certainly
follow
upon
their
public
exhibition
those
poor
injured
volumes
were
never
sent
some
years
ago
one
of
the
most
rare
books
printed
by
machlinia
a
thin
folio
was
discovered
bound
in
sheep
by
a
country
bookbinder
and
cut
down
to
suit
the
size
of
some
quarto
tracts
but
do
not
let
us
suppose
that
country
binders
are
the
only
culprits
it
is
not
very
long
since
the
discovery
of
a
unique
caxton
in
one
of
our
largest
london
libraries
it
was
in
boards
as
originally
issued
by
the
binder
and
a
great
fuss
very
properly
was
made
over
the
treasure
trove
of
course
cries
the
reader
it
was
kept
in
its
original
covers
with
all
the
interesting
associations
of
its
early
state
untouched
no
such
thing
instead
of
making
a
suitable
case
in
which
it
could
be
preserved
just
as
it
was
it
was
placed
in
the
hands
of
a
london
binder
with
the
order
whole
bind
in
velvet
he
did
his
best
and
the
volume
now
glows
luxuriously
in
its
gilt
edges
and
its
inappropriate
covering
and
alas
with
of
its
uncut
margin
taken
off
all
round
how
do
i
know
that
because
the
clever
binder
seeing
some
remarks
on
one
of
the
margins
turned
the
leaf
down
to
avoid
cutting
them
off
and
that
stern
witness
will
always
testify
to
the
observant
reader
the
original
size
of
the
book
this
same
binder
on
another
occasion
placed
a
unique
fifteenth
century
indulgence
in
warm
water
to
separate
it
from
the
cover
upon
which
it
was
pasted
the
result
being
that
when
dry
it
was
so
distorted
as
to
be
useless
that
man
soon
after
passed
to
another
world
where
we
may
hope
his
works
have
not
followed
him
and
that
his
merits
as
a
good
citizen
and
an
honest
man
counterbalanced
his
as
a
binder
other
similar
instances
will
occur
to
the
memory
of
many
a
reader
and
doubtless
the
same
sin
will
be
committed
from
time
to
time
by
certain
binders
who
seem
to
have
an
ingrained
antipathy
to
rough
edges
and
large
margins
which
of
course
are
in
their
view
made
by
nature
as
food
for
the
shaving
tub
de
rome
a
celebrated
bookbinder
of
the
eighteenth
century
who
was
nicknamed
by
dibdin
the
great
cropper
was
although
in
private
life
an
estimable
man
much
addicted
to
the
vice
of
reducing
the
margins
of
all
books
sent
to
him
to
bind
so
far
did
he
go
that
he
even
spared
not
a
fine
copy
of
froissart
chronicles
on
vellum
in
which
was
the
autograph
of
the
de
thou
but
cropped
it
most
cruelly
owners
too
have
occasionally
diseased
minds
with
regard
to
margins
a
friend
writes
your
amusing
anecdotes
have
brought
to
my
memory
several
biblioclasts
whom
i
have
known
one
roughly
cut
the
margins
off
his
books
with
a
knife
hacking
away
very
much
like
a
hedger
and
ditcher
large
paper
volumes
were
his
especial
delight
as
they
gave
more
paper
the
slips
thus
obtained
were
used
for
another
with
the
bump
of
order
unnaturally
developed
had
his
folios
and
quartos
all
reduced
in
binding
to
one
size
so
that
they
might
look
even
on
his
bookshelves
this
latter
was
doubtless
cousin
to
him
who
deliberately
cut
down
all
his
books
close
to
the
text
because
he
had
been
several
times
annoyed
by
readers
who
made
marginal
notes
the
indignities
too
suffered
by
some
books
in
their
lettering
fancy
an
early
quarto
on
knighthood
labelled
tracts
or
a
translation
of
virgil
sermons
the
histories
of
troy
printed
by
caxton
still
exists
with
eracles
on
the
back
as
its
title
because
that
name
occurs
several
times
in
the
early
chapters
and
the
binder
was
too
proud
to
seek
advice
the
words
miscellaneous
or
old
pieces
were
sometimes
used
when
binders
were
at
a
loss
for
lettering
and
many
other
instances
might
be
mentioned
the
rapid
spread
of
printing
throughout
europe
in
the
latter
part
of
the
fifteenth
century
caused
a
great
fall
in
the
value
of
plain
and
the
immediate
consequence
of
this
was
the
destruction
of
numerous
volumes
written
upon
parchment
which
were
used
by
the
binders
to
strengthen
the
backs
of
their
rivals
these
slips
of
vellum
or
parchment
are
quite
common
in
old
books
sometimes
whole
sheets
are
used
as
and
often
reveal
the
existence
of
most
valuable
works
unknown
before
proving
at
the
same
time
the
small
value
formerly
attached
to
them
many
a
bibliographer
while
examining
old
books
has
to
his
great
puzzlement
come
across
short
slips
of
parchment
nearly
always
from
some
old
manuscript
sticking
out
like
guards
from
the
midst
of
the
leaves
these
suggest
at
first
imperfections
or
damage
done
to
the
volume
but
if
examined
closely
it
will
be
found
that
they
are
always
in
the
middle
of
a
paper
section
and
the
real
reason
of
their
existence
is
just
the
same
as
when
two
leaves
of
parchment
occur
here
and
there
in
a
paper
volume
viz
strength
strength
to
resist
the
lug
which
the
strong
thread
makes
against
the
middle
of
each
section
these
slips
represent
old
books
destroyed
and
like
the
slips
already
noticed
should
always
be
carefully
examined
when
valuable
books
have
been
when
they
have
become
soiled
by
dirty
hands
or
spoiled
by
water
stains
or
injured
by
grease
spots
nothing
is
more
astonishing
to
the
uninitiated
than
the
transformation
they
undergo
in
the
hands
of
a
skilful
restorer
the
covers
are
first
carefully
dissected
the
eye
of
the
operator
keeping
a
careful
outlook
for
any
fragments
of
old
mss
or
early
printed
books
which
may
have
been
used
by
the
original
binder
no
force
should
be
applied
to
separate
parts
which
adhere
together
a
little
warm
water
and
care
is
sure
to
overcome
that
difficulty
when
all
the
sections
are
loose
the
separate
sheets
are
placed
singly
in
a
bath
of
cold
water
and
allowed
to
remain
there
until
all
the
dirt
has
soaked
out
if
not
sufficiently
purified
a
little
hydrochloric
or
oxalic
acid
or
caustic
potash
may
be
put
in
the
water
according
as
the
stains
are
from
grease
or
from
ink
here
is
where
an
unpractised
binder
will
probably
injure
a
book
for
life
if
the
chemicals
are
too
strong
or
the
sheets
remain
too
long
in
the
bath
or
are
not
thoroughly
cleansed
from
the
bleach
before
they
are
the
certain
seeds
of
decay
are
planted
in
the
paper
and
although
for
a
time
the
leaves
may
look
bright
to
the
eye
and
even
crackle
under
the
hand
like
the
soundest
paper
yet
in
the
course
of
a
few
years
the
enemy
will
appear
the
fibre
will
decay
and
the
existence
of
the
books
will
terminate
in
a
state
of
white
tinder
everything
which
diminishes
the
interest
of
a
book
is
inimical
to
its
preservation
and
in
fact
is
its
enemy
therefore
a
few
words
upon
the
destruction
of
old
bindings
i
remember
purchasing
many
years
ago
at
a
suburban
book
stall
a
perfect
copy
of
moxon
mechanic
exercises
now
a
scarce
work
the
volumes
were
uncut
and
had
the
original
marble
covers
they
looked
so
attractive
in
their
old
fashioned
dress
that
i
at
once
determined
to
preserve
it
my
binder
soon
made
for
them
a
neat
wooden
box
in
the
shape
of
a
book
with
morocco
back
properly
lettered
where
i
trust
the
originals
will
be
preserved
from
dust
and
injury
for
many
a
long
year
old
covers
whether
boards
or
paper
should
always
be
retained
if
in
any
state
approaching
decency
a
case
which
can
be
embellished
to
any
extent
looks
every
whit
as
well
upon
the
shelf
and
gives
even
greater
protection
than
binding
it
has
also
this
great
advantage
it
does
not
deprive
your
descendants
of
the
opportunity
of
seeing
for
themselves
exactly
in
what
dress
the
book
buyers
of
four
centuries
ago
received
their
volumes
chapter
ix
collectors
after
all
depredators
who
ought
to
have
known
better
have
perhaps
done
as
much
real
damage
in
libraries
as
any
other
enemy
i
do
not
refer
to
thieves
who
if
they
injure
the
owners
do
no
harm
to
the
books
themselves
by
merely
transferring
them
from
one
set
of
bookshelves
to
another
nor
do
i
refer
to
certain
readers
who
frequent
our
public
libraries
and
to
save
themselves
the
trouble
of
copying
will
cut
out
whole
articles
from
magazines
or
encyclopaedias
such
depredations
are
not
frequent
and
only
occur
with
books
easily
replaced
and
do
not
therefore
call
for
more
than
a
passing
mention
but
it
is
a
serious
matter
when
nature
produces
such
a
wicked
old
biblioclast
as
john
bagford
one
of
the
founders
of
the
society
of
antiquaries
who
in
the
beginning
of
the
last
century
went
about
the
country
from
library
to
library
tearing
away
title
pages
from
rare
books
of
all
sizes
these
he
sorted
out
into
nationalities
and
towns
and
so
with
a
lot
of
manuscript
notes
and
miscellaneous
collections
of
all
kinds
formed
over
a
hundred
folio
volumes
now
preserved
in
the
british
museum
that
they
are
of
service
as
materials
in
compiling
a
general
history
of
printing
can
not
be
denied
but
the
destruction
of
many
rare
books
was
the
result
and
more
than
any
benefit
bibliographers
will
ever
receive
from
them
when
here
and
there
throughout
those
volumes
you
meet
with
titles
of
books
now
either
unknown
entirely
or
of
the
greatest
rarity
when
you
find
the
colophon
from
the
end
or
the
insigne
typographi
from
the
first
leaf
of
a
rare
fifteener
pasted
down
with
dozens
of
others
varying
in
value
you
can
not
bless
the
memory
of
the
antiquarian
shoemaker
john
bagford
his
portrait
a
painted
by
howard
was
engraved
by
vertue
and
for
the
bibliographical
decameron
a
bad
example
often
finds
imitators
and
every
season
there
crop
up
for
public
sale
one
or
two
such
collections
formed
by
bibliomaniacs
who
although
calling
themselves
bibliophiles
ought
really
to
be
ranked
among
the
worst
enemies
of
books
the
following
is
copied
from
a
trade
catalogue
dated
april
and
affords
a
fair
idea
of
the
extent
to
which
these
heartless
destroyers
will
go
missal
illuminations
fifty
different
capital
letters
vellum
in
rich
gold
and
colours
many
inches
square
the
floral
decorations
are
of
great
beauty
ranging
from
the
xiith
to
xvth
century
mounted
on
stout
in
nice
preservation
these
beautiful
letters
have
been
cut
from
precious
and
as
specimens
of
early
art
are
extremely
valuable
many
of
them
being
worth
each
proeme
is
a
man
well
known
to
the
london
dealers
in
old
books
he
is
wealthy
and
cares
not
what
he
spends
to
carry
out
his
bibliographical
craze
which
is
the
collection
of
title
pages
these
he
ruthlessly
extracts
frequently
leaving
the
decapitated
carcase
of
the
books
for
which
he
cares
not
behind
him
unlike
the
destroyer
bagford
he
has
no
useful
object
in
view
but
simply
follows
a
senseless
kind
of
classification
for
instance
one
set
of
volumes
contains
nothing
but
engraved
titles
and
woe
betide
the
grand
old
dutch
folios
of
the
seventeenth
century
if
they
cross
his
path
another
is
a
volume
of
coarse
or
quaint
titles
which
certainly
answer
the
end
of
showing
how
idiotic
and
conceited
some
authors
have
been
here
you
find
sib
bowels
opened
in
divers
sermons
cheek
by
jowl
with
the
discourse
attributed
falsely
to
huntington
the
calvinist
die
and
be
damned
with
many
others
too
coarse
to
be
quoted
the
odd
titles
adopted
for
his
poems
by
taylor
the
enliven
several
pages
and
make
one
mouth
water
for
the
books
themselves
a
third
volume
includes
only
such
titles
as
have
the
printer
device
if
you
shut
your
eyes
to
the
injury
done
by
such
collectors
you
may
to
a
certain
extent
enjoy
the
collection
for
there
is
great
beauty
in
some
titles
but
such
a
pursuit
is
neither
useful
nor
meritorious
by
and
by
the
end
comes
and
then
dispersion
follows
collection
and
the
volumes
which
probably
cost
each
in
their
formation
will
be
knocked
down
to
a
dealer
for
finally
gravitating
into
the
south

the

followed
by

two

a
similar
mania
arose
at
the
beginning
of
this
century
for
collections
of
illuminated
initials
which
were
taken
from
and
arranged
on
the
pages
of
a
blank
book
in
alphabetical
order
some
of
our
cathedral
libraries
suffered
severely
from
depredations
of
this
kind
at
lincoln
in
the
early
part
of
this
century
the
boys
put
on
their
robes
in
the
library
a
room
close
to
the
choir
here
were
numerous
old
and
eight
or
ten
rare
caxtons
the
choir
boys
used
often
to
amuse
themselves
while
waiting
for
the
signal
to
fall
in
by
cutting
out
with
their
the
illuminated
initials
and
vignettes
which
they
would
take
into
the
choir
with
them
and
pass
round
from
one
to
another
the
dean
and
chapter
of
those
days
were
not
much
better
for
they
let
dibdin
have
all
their
caxtons
for
a
consideration
he
made
a
little
catalogue
of
them
which
he
called
a
lincolne
nosegaye
eventually
they
were
absorbed
into
the
collection
at
althorp
the
late
caspari
was
a
destroyer
of
books
his
rare
collection
of
early
woodcuts
exhibited
in
at
the
caxton
celebration
had
been
frequently
augmented
by
the
purchase
of
illustrated
books
the
plates
of
which
were
taken
out
and
mounted
on
bristol
boards
to
enrich
his
collection
he
once
showed
me
the
remains
of
a
fine
copy
of
theurdanck
which
he
had
served
so
and
i
have
now
before
me
several
of
the
leaves
which
he
then
gave
me
and
which
for
beauty
of
engraving
and
cleverness
of
typography
surpasses
any
typographical
work
known
to
me
it
was
printed
for
the
emperor
maximilian
by
hans
schonsperger
of
nuremberg
and
to
make
it
unique
all
the
punches
were
cut
on
purpose
and
as
many
as
seven
or
eight
varieties
of
each
letter
which
together
with
the
clever
way
in
which
the
ornamental
flourishes
are
carried
above
and
below
the
line
has
led
even
experienced
printers
to
deny
its
being
typography
it
is
nevertheless
entirely
from
cast
types
a
copy
in
good
condition
costs
about
many
years
since
i
purchased
at
sotheby
a
large
lot
of
leaves
on
vellum
some
being
whole
sections
of
a
book
but
mostly
single
leaves
many
were
so
mutilated
by
the
excision
of
initials
as
to
be
worthless
but
those
with
poor
initials
or
with
none
were
quite
good
and
when
sorted
out
i
found
i
had
got
large
portions
of
nearly
twenty
different
mostly
horae
showing
twelve
varieties
of
fifteenth
century
handwriting
in
latin
french
dutch
and
german
i
had
each
sort
bound
separately
and
they
now
form
an
interesting
collection
portrait
collectors
have
destroyed
many
books
by
abstracting
the
frontispiece
to
add
to
their
treasures
and
when
once
a
book
is
made
imperfect
its
march
to
destruction
is
rapid
this
is
why
books
like
atkyns
origin
and
growth
of
printing
have
become
impossible
to
get
when
issued
atkyns
pamphlet
had
a
fine
frontispiece
by
logan
containing
portraits
of
king
charles
ii
attended
by
archbishop
sheldon
the
duke
of
albermarle
and
the
earl
of
clarendon
as
portraits
of
these
celebrities
excepting
of
course
the
king
are
extremely
rare
collectors
have
bought
up
this
tract
of
atkyns
whenever
it
has
been
offered
and
torn
away
the
frontispiece
to
adorn
their
collection
this
is
why
if
you
take
up
any
sale
catalogue
of
old
books
you
are
certain
to
find
here
and
there
appended
to
the
description
wanting
the
title
wanting
two
plates
or
wanting
the
last
page
it
is
quite
common
to
find
in
old
especially
fifteenth
century
both
vellum
and
paper
the
blank
margins
of
leaves
cut
away
this
will
be
from
the
side
edge
or
from
the
foot
and
the
recurrence
of
this
mutilation
puzzled
me
for
many
years
it
arose
from
the
scarcity
of
paper
in
former
times
so
that
when
a
message
had
to
be
sent
which
required
more
exactitude
than
could
be
entrusted
to
the
stupid
memory
of
a
household
messenger
the
master
or
chaplain
went
to
the
library
and
not
having
paper
to
use
took
down
an
old
book
and
cut
from
its
broad
margins
one
or
more
slips
to
serve
his
present
need
i
feel
quite
inclined
to
reckon
among
enemies
those
bibliomaniacs
and
possessors
who
being
unable
to
carry
their
treasures
into
the
next
world
do
all
they
can
to
hinder
their
usefulness
in
this
what
a
difficulty
there
is
to
obtain
admission
to
the
curious
library
of
old
samuel
pepys
the
diarist
there
it
is
at
magdalene
college
cambridge
in
the
identical
provided
for
the
books
by
pepys
himself
but
no
one
can
gain
admission
except
in
company
of
two
fellows
of
the
college
and
if
a
single
book
be
lost
the
whole
library
goes
away
to
a
neighbouring
college
however
willing
and
anxious
to
oblige
it
is
evident
that
no
one
can
use
the
library
at
the
expense
of
the
time
if
not
temper
of
two
fellows
some
similar
restrictions
are
in
force
at
the
teylerian
museum
haarlem
where
a
lifelong
imprisonment
is
inflicted
upon
its
many
treasures
some
centuries
ago
a
valuable
collection
of
books
was
left
to
the
guildford
endowed
grammar
school
the
schoolmaster
was
to
be
held
personally
responsible
for
the
safety
of
every
volume
which
if
lost
he
was
bound
to
replace
i
am
told
that
one
master
to
minimize
his
risk
as
much
as
possible
took
the
following
barbarous
course
as
soon
as
he
was
in
possession
he
raised
the
boards
of
the
schoolroom
floor
and
having
carefully
packed
all
the
books
between
the
joists
had
the
boards
nailed
down
again
little
recked
he
how
many
rats
and
mice
made
their
nests
there
he
was
bound
to
account
some
day
for
every
single
volume
and
he
saw
no
way
so
safe
as
rigid
imprisonment
the
late
sir
thomas
phillipps
of
middle
hill
was
a
remarkable
instance
of
a
bibliotaph
he
bought
bibliographical
treasures
simply
to
bury
them
his
mansion
was
crammed
with
books
he
purchased
whole
libraries
and
never
even
saw
what
he
had
bought
among
some
of
his
purchases
was
the
first
book
printed
in

are
you
married
have
you
offspring
boys
especially
i
mean
say
between
six
and
twelve
years
of
age
have
you
also
a
literary
workshop
supplied
with
choice
tools
some
for
use
some
for
ornament
where
you
pass
pleasant
hours
and
is
ah
there
the
rub
is
there
a
special
whose
special
duty
it
is
to
keep
your
den
daily
dusted
and
in
order
plead
you
guilty
to
these
indictments
then
am
i
sure
of
a
sympathetic
dust
it
is
all
a
delusion
it
is
not
the
dust
that
makes
women
anxious
to
invade
the
inmost
recesses
of
your
sanctum
it
is
an
ingrained
curiosity
and
this
feminine
weakness
which
dates
from
eve
is
a
common
motive
in
the
stories
of
our
oldest
literature
and
what
made
fatima
so
anxious
to
know
the
contents
of
the
room
forbidden
her
by
bluebeard
it
was
positively
nothing
to
her
and
its
contents
caused
not
the
slightest
annoyance
to
anybody
that
story
has
a
bad
moral
and
it
would
in
many
ways
have
been
more
satisfactory
had
the
heroine
been
left
to
take
her
place
in
the
chamber
side
by
side
with
her
peccant
predecessors
why
need
the
god
forgive
me
bother
themselves
about
the
inside
of
a
man
library
and
whether
it
wants
dusting
or
not
my
boys
playroom
in
which
is
a
bench
a
lathe
and
no
end
of
litter
is
never
tidied
perhaps
it
be
or
perhaps
their
youthful
vigour
wo
stand
it
but
my
workroom
must
needs
be
dusted
daily
with
the
delusive
promise
that
each
book
and
paper
shall
be
replaced
exactly
where
it
was
the
damage
done
by
such
continued
treatment
is
incalculable
at
certain
times
these
observances
are
kept
more
religiously
than
others
but
especially
should
the
married
or
single
beware
of
the
ides
of
march
so
soon
as
february
is
dead
and
gone
a
feeling
of
unrest
seizes
the
mind
this
increases
day
by
day
and
becomes
dominant
towards
the
middle
of
the
month
about
which
period
sundry
hints
are
thrown
out
as
to
whether
you
are
likely
to
be
absent
for
a
day
or
two
beware
the
fever
called
spring
clean
is
on
and
unless
you
stand
firm
you
will
rue
it
go
away
if
the
fates
so
will
but
take
the
key
of
your
own
domain
with
you
do
not
misunderstand
not
for
a
moment
would
i
advocate
dust
and
dirt
they
are
enemies
and
should
be
routed
but
let
the
necessary
routing
be
done
under
your
own
eye
explain
where
caution
must
be
used
and
in
what
cases
tenderness
is
a
virtue
and
if
one
eve
in
the
family
can
be
indoctrinated
with
you
are
a
happy
man
her
price
is
above
that
of
rubies
she
will
prolong
your
life
books
must
now
and
then
be
taken
clean
out
of
their
shelves
but
they
should
be
tended
lovingly
and
with
judgment
if
the
dusting
can
be
done
just
outside
the
room
so
much
the
better
the
books
removed
the
shelf
should
be
lifted
quite
out
of
its
bearings
cleansed
and
wiped
and
then
each
volume
should
be
taken
separately
and
gently
rubbed
on
back
and
sides
with
a
soft
cloth
in
returning
the
volumes
to
their
places
notice
should
be
taken
of
the
binding
and
especially
when
the
books
are
in
whole
calf
or
morocco
care
should
be
taken
not
to
let
them
rub
together
the
best
bound
books
are
soonest
injured
and
quickly
deteriorate
in
bad
company
certain
volumes
indeed
have
evil
tempers
and
will
scratch
the
faces
of
all
their
neighbours
who
are
too
familiar
with
them
such
are
books
with
metal
clasps
and
rivets
on
their
edges
and
such
again
are
those
abominable
old
rascals
chiefly
born
in
the
fifteenth
century
who
are
proud
of
being
dressed
in
real
boards
with
brass
corners
and
pass
their
lives
with
fearful
knobs
and
metal
bosses
mostly
five
in
number
firmly
fixed
on
one
of
their
sides
if
the
tendencies
of
such
ruffians
are
not
curbed
they
will
do
as
much
mischief
to
their
gentle
neighbours
as
when
a
collie
worries
the
sheep
these
evil
results
may
always
be
minimized
by
placing
a
piece
of
millboard
between
the
culprit
and
his
victim
i
have
seen
lovely
bindings
sadly
marked
by
such
uncanny
neighbours
when
your
books
are
being
dusted
do
impute
too
much
common
sense
to
your
assistants
take
their
ignorance
for
granted
and
tell
them
at
once
never
to
lift
any
book
by
one
of
its
covers
that
treatment
is
sure
to
strain
the
back
and
ten
to
one
the
weight
will
be
at
the
same
time
miscalculated
and
the
volume
will
fall
your
female
help
too
dearly
loves
a
good
tall
pile
to
work
at
and
as
a
rule
her
notions
of
the
centre
of
gravity
are
not
accurate
leading
often
to
a
general
downfall
and
the
damage
of
many
a
corner
again
if
not
supervised
and
instructed
she
is
very
apt
to
rub
the
dust
into
instead
of
off
the
edges
each
volume
should
be
held
tightly
so
as
to
prevent
the
leaves
from
gaping
and
then
wiped
from
the
back
to
the
a
soft
brush
will
be
found
useful
if
there
is
much
dust
the
whole
exterior
should
also
be
rubbed
with
a
soft
cloth
and
then
the
covers
should
be
opened
and
the
hinges
of
the
binding
examined
for
mildew
will
assert
itself
both
inside
and
outside
certain
books
and
that
most
pertinaciously
it
has
unaccountable
likes
and
dislikes
some
bindings
seem
positively
to
invite
damp
and
mildew
will
attack
these
when
no
other
books
on
the
same
shelf
show
any
signs
of
it
when
discovered
carefully
wipe
it
away
and
then
let
the
book
remain
a
few
days
standing
open
in
the
driest
and
airiest
spot
you
can
select
great
care
should
be
taken
not
to
let
grit
such
as
blows
in
at
the
open
window
from
many
a
dusty
road
be
upon
your
duster
or
you
will
probably
find
fine
scratches
like
an
outline
map
of
europe
all
over
your
smooth
calf
by
which
your
heart
and
eye
as
well
as
your
book
will
be
wounded
helps
are
very
apt
to
fill
the
shelves
too
tightly
so
that
to
extract
a
book
you
have
to
use
force
often
to
the
injury
of
the
beware
of
this
mistake
it
frequently
occurs
through
not
noticing
that
one
small
book
is
purposely
placed
at
each
end
of
the
shelf
beneath
the
movable
thus
not
only
saving
space
but
preventing
the
injury
which
a
book
would
be
sure
to
receive
from
uneven
pressure
after
all
the
best
guide
in
these
as
in
many
other
matters
is
common
sense
a
quality
which
in
olden
times
must
have
been
much
more
common
than
in
these
days
else
the
phrase
would
never
have
become
rooted
in
our
common
tongue
children
with
all
their
innocence
are
often
guilty
of
i
must
confess
to
having
once
taken
down
humphrey
history
of
writing
which
contains
many
plates
to
amuse
a
sick
daughter
the
object
was
certainly
gained
but
the
consequences
of
so
bad
a
precedent
were
disastrous
that
copy
which
i
am
glad
to
say
was
easily
notwithstanding
great
care
on
my
part
became
soiled
and
torn
and
at
last
was
given
up
to
nursery
martyrdom
can
i
regret
it
surely
not
for
although
bibliographically
sinful
who
can
weigh
the
amount
of
real
pleasure
received
and
actual
pain
ignored
by
the
patient
in
the
contemplation
of
those
colours
a
neighbour
of
mine
some
few
years
ago
suffered
severely
from
a
propensity
apparently
irresistible
in
one
of
his
daughters
to
tear
his
library
books
she
was
six
years
old
and
would
go
quietly
to
a
shelf
and
take
down
a
book
or
two
and
having
torn
a
dozen
leaves
or
so
down
the
middle
would
replace
the
volumes
fragments
and
all
in
their
places
the
damage
being
undiscovered
until
the
books
were
wanted
for
use
reprimand
expostulation
and
even
punishment
were
of
no
avail
but
a
single
whipping
effected
a
cure
boys
however
are
by
far
more
destructive
than
girls
and
have
naturally
no
reverence
for
age
whether
in
man
or
books
who
does
not
fear
a
schoolboy
with
his
first
as
wordsworth
did
not
say
you
may
trace
him
oft
by
scars
which
his
activity
has
left
upon
our
shelves

with

full
of

and
sticky
fingers
they
can
pull

the
books
on
your
bottom
shelves

knowing
the
damage
and

what
boys
can
do
may
be
gathered
from
the
following
true
story
sent
me
by
a
correspondent
who
was
the
immediate
sufferer
one
summer
day
he
met
in
town
an
acquaintance
who
for
many
years
had
been
abroad
and
finding
his
appetite
for
old
books
as
keen
as
ever
invited
him
home
to
have
a
mental
feed
upon
fifteeners
and
other
bibliographical
dainties
preliminary
to
the
coarser
pleasures
enjoyed
at
the
the
home
was
an
old
mansion
in
the
outskirts
of
london
whose
very
architecture
was
suggestive
of
and
the
weather
alas
was
rainy
and
as
they
approached
the
house
loud
peals
of
laughter
reached
their
ears
the
children
were
keeping
a
birthday
with
a
few
young
friends
the
damp
forbad
all
outdoor
play
and
having
been
left
too
much
to
their
own
devices
they
had
invaded
the
library
it
was
just
after
the
battle
of
balaclava
and
the
heroism
of
the
combatants
on
that
field
was
in
mouth
so
the
mischievous
young
imps
divided
themselves
into
two
opposing
camps
britons
and
russians
the
russian
division
was
just
inside
the
door
behind
ramparts
formed
of
old
folios
and
quartos
taken
from
the
bottom
shelves
and
piled
to
the
height
of
about
four
feet
it
was
a
wall
of
old
fathers
fifteenth
century
chronicles
county
histories
chaucer
lydgate
and
such
like
some
few
yards
off
were
the
britishers
provided
with
heaps
of
small
books
as
missiles
with
which
they
kept
up
a
skirmishing
cannonade
against
the
foe
imagine
the
tableau

elderly
gentlemen
enter
hurriedly
paterfamilias
receiving
quite
unintentionally
the
first
edition
of
paradise
lost
in
the
pit

with
a

he
had
ever
had

and

field
postscriptum
although
strictly
speaking
the
following
anecdote
does
not
illustrate
any
form
of
real
injury
to
books
it
is
so
racy
and
in
these
days
of
extravagant
biddings
so
tantalizing
that
i
must
step
just
outside
the
strict
line
of
pertinence
in
order
to
place
it
on
record
it
was
sent
to
me
as
a
personal
experience
by
my
friend
george
clulow
a
bibliophile
and
xylographer
to
ye
sette
of
ye
odde
volumes
the
date
is
he
writes
of
the
gainsborough
of
which
you
tell
in
enemies
of
books
i
should
like
to
narrate
an
experience
of
my
own
of
some
twenty
years
ago
late
one
evening
at
my
father
house
i
saw
a
catalogue
of
a
sale
of
furniture
farm
implements
and
books
which
was
announced
to
take
place
on
the
following
morning
at
a
country
rectory
in
derbyshire
some
four
miles
from
the
nearest
railway
station
it
was
summer
time
the
country
at
its
best
and
with
the
attraction
of
an
old
book
i
decided
on
a
day
holiday
and
eight
the
next
morning
found
me
in
the
train
for
c
and
after
a
variation
in
my
programme
caused
by
my
having
walked
three
miles
west
before
i
discovered
that
my
destination
was
three
miles
east
of
the
railway
station
i
arrived
at
the
rectory
at
noon
and
found
assembled
some
thirty
or
forty
of
the
neighbouring
farmers
their
wives
and
all
seemingly
bent
on
a
day
idling
rather
than
business
the
sale
was
announced
for
noon
but
it
was
an
hour
later
before
the
auctioneer
put
in
an
appearance
and
the
first
operation
in
which
he
took
part
and
in
which
he
invited
my
assistance
was
to
make
a
hearty
meal
of
bread
and
cheese
and
beer
in
the
rectory
kitchen
this
over
the
business
of
the
day
began
by
a
sundry
collection
of
pots
pans
and
kettles
being
brought
to
the
competition
of
the
public
followed
by
some
lots
of
bedding
etc
the
catalogue
gave
books
as
the
first
part
of
the
sale
and
as
three
was
reached
my
patience
was
gone
and
i
protested
to
the
auctioneer
against
his
not
selling
in
accordance
with
his
catalogue
to
this
he
replied
that
there
was
not
time
enough
and
that
he
would
sell
the
books
this
was
too
much
for
me
and
i
suggested
that
he
had
broken
faith
with
the
buyers
and
had
brought
me
to
c
on
a
false
pretence
this
however
did
not
seem
to
disturb
his
good
humour
or
to
make
him
unhappy
and
his
answer
was
to
call
who
was
acting
as
porter
and
to
tell
him
to
give
the
gentleman
the
key
of
the
room
and
to
bring
down
any
of
the
books
he
might
pick
out
and
he
sell
i
followed
and
soon
found
myself
in
a
charming
nook
of
a
library
full
of
books
mostly
old
divinity
but
with
a
large
number
of
the
best
miscellaneous
literature
of
the
sixteenth
century
english
and
foreign
a
very
short
look
over
the
shelves
produced
some
thirty
black
letter
books
three
or
four
illuminated
missals
and
some
book
rarities
of
a
more
recent
date
took
them
downstairs
and
i
wondered
what
would
happen
i
was
not
long
in
doubt
for
book
by
book
and
in
lots
of
two
and
three
my
selection
was
knocked
down
in
rapid
succession
at
prices
varying
from
to
this
latter
sum
seeming
to
be
the
utmost
limit
to
the
speculative
turn
of
my
competitors
the
of
the
lot
was
however
kept
back
by
the
auctioneer
because
as
he
said
it
was
pretty
book
and
i
began
to
respect
his
critical
judgment
for
pretty
book
it
was
being
a
large
paper
copy
of
bibliographical
decameron
three
volumes
in
the
original
binding
suffice
it
to
say
that
including
this
charming
book
my
purchases
did
not
amount
to
and
i
had
pretty
well
a
of
books
for
my
money
more
than
i
wanted
much
having
brought
them
home
i
them
out
and
the
realised
four
times
what
i
gave
for
the
whole
leaving
me
with
some
real
book
treasures
some
weeks
afterwards
i
heard
that
the
remainder
of
the
books
were
literally
treated
as
waste
lumber
and
carted
off
to
the
neighbouring
town
and
were
to
be
had
any
one
of
them
for
sixpence
from
a
cobbler
who
had
allowed
his
shop
to
be
used
as
a
store
house
for
them
the
news
of
their
being
there
reached
the
ears
of
an
old
bookseller
in
one
of
the
large
towns
and
he
i
think
cleared
out
the
lot
so
curious
an
instance
of
the
most
total
ignorance
on
the
part
of
the
sellers
and
i
may
add
on
the
part
of
the
possible
buyers
also
i
think
is
worth
noting
how
would
the
reader
in
this
year
of
grace
like
such
an
experience
as
that
conclusion
it
is
a
great
pity
that
there
should
be
so
many
distinct
enemies
at
work
for
the
destruction
of
literature
and
that
they
should
so
often
be
allowed
to
work
out
their
sad
end
looked
at
rightly
the
possession
of
any
old
book
is
a
sacred
trust
which
a
conscientious
owner
or
guardian
would
as
soon
think
of
ignoring
as
a
parent
would
of
neglecting
his
child
an
old
book
whatever
its
subject
or
internal
merits
is
truly
a
portion
of
the
national
history
we
may
imitate
it
and
print
it
in
but
we
can
never
exactly
reproduce
it
and
as
an
historical
document
it
should
be
carefully
preserved
i
do
not
envy
any
man
that
absence
of
sentiment
which
makes
some
people
careless
of
the
memorials
of
their
ancestors
and
whose
blood
can
be
warmed
up
only
by
talking
of
horses
or
the
price
of
hops
to
them
solitude
means
and
anybody
company
is
preferable
to
their
own
what
an
immense
amount
of
calm
enjoyment
and
mental
renovation
do
such
men
miss
even
a
millionaire
will
ease
his
toils
lengthen
his
life
and
add
a
hundred
per
cent
to
his
daily
pleasures
if
he
becomes
a
bibliophile
while
to
the
man
of
business
with
a
taste
for
books
who
through
the
day
has
struggled
in
the
battle
of
life
with
all
its
irritating
rebuffs
and
anxieties
what
a
blessed
season
of
pleasurable
repose
opens
upon
him
as
he
enters
his
sanctum
where
every
article
wafts
to
him
a
welcome

every
