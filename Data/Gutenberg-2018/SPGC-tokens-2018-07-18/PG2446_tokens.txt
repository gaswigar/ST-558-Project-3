i
dr

it
is
evening
the
room
is
plainly
but
neatly
appointed
and
furnished
in
the
wall
are
two
doors
the
farther
leads
out
to
the
hall
the
nearer
to
the
doctor
study
in
the
wall
opposite
the
door
leading
to
the
hall
is
a
door
leading
to
the
other
rooms
occupied
by
the
family
in
the
middle
of
the
same
wall
stands
the
stove
and
further
forward
a
couch
with
a
hanging
over

and
an

seen
sitting
at
the
dining
table
on
which
a
lamp
is
burning
he
has
a
napkin
tucked
under
his
chin
and
stockmann
is
standing
by
the
table
handing
him
a
large
of
roast
beef
the
other
places
at
the
table
are
empty
and
the
table
somewhat
in
disorder
evidently
a
meal
having
recently
been
finished
stockmann
you
see
if
you
come
an
hour
late
mr
billing
you
have
to
put
up
with
cold
meat
billing
as
he
eats
it
is
uncommonly
good
thank
you
remarkably
good
stockmann
my
husband
makes
such
a
point
of
having
his
meals
punctually
you
know
billing
that
does
affect
me
a
bit
indeed
i
almost
think
i
enjoy
a
meal
all
the
better
when
i
can
sit
down
and
eat
all
by
myself
and
undisturbed
stockmann
oh
well
as
long
as
you
are
enjoying
it
turns
to
the
hall
door
listening
i
expect
that
is
hovstad
coming
too
billing
very
likely
peter
stockmann
comes
in
he
wears
an
overcoat
and
his
official
hat
and
carries
a
stick
peter
stockmann
good
evening
katherine
stockmann
coming
forward
into
the
ah
good
evening
is
it
you
how
good
of
you
to
come
up
and
see
us
peter
stockmann
i
happened
to
be
passing
and
so
looks
into
the
but
you
have
company
with
you
i
see
stockmann
a
little
embarrassed
oh
no
it
was
quite
by
chance
he
came
in
hurriedly
wo
you
come
in
and
have
something
too
peter
stockmann
i
no
thank
you
good
gracious
hot
meat
at
night
not
with
my
digestion
stockmann
oh
but
just
once
in
a
way
peter
stockmann
no
no
my
dear
lady
i
stick
to
my
tea
and
bread
and
butter
it
is
much
more
wholesome
in
the
long
run
and
a
little
more
economical
too
stockmann
smiling
now
you
must
think
that
thomas
and
i
are
spendthrifts
peter
stockmann
not
you
my
dear
i
would
never
think
that
of
you
points
to
the
doctor
study
is
he
not
at
home
stockmann
no
he
went
out
for
a
little
turn
after
supper
he
and
the
boys
peter
stockmann
i
doubt
if
that
is
a
wise
thing
to
do
listens
i
fancy
i
hear
him
coming
now
stockmann
no
i
do
think
it
is
he
a
knock
is
heard
at
the
door
come
in
hovstad
comes
in
from
the
hall
oh
it
is
you
hovstad
hovstad
yes
i
hope
you
will
forgive
me
but
i
was
delayed
at
the
printers
good
evening
mayor
peter
stockmann
bowing
a
little
distantly
good
evening
you
have
come
on
business
no
doubt
hovstad
partly
it
about
an
article
for
the
paper
peter
stockmann
so
i
imagined
i
hear
my
brother
has
become
a
prolific
contributor
to
the
people
messenger
hovstad
yes
he
is
good
enough
to
write
in
the
people
messenger
when
he
has
any
home
truths
to
tell
stockmann
to
hovstad
but
wo
you
points
to
the
peter
stockmann
quite
so
quite
so
i
do
blame
him
in
the
least
as
a
writer
for
addressing
himself
to
the
quarters
where
he
will
find
the
readiest
sympathy
and
besides
that
i
personally
have
no
reason
to
bear
any
ill
will
to
your
paper
hovstad
hovstad
i
quite
agree
with
you
peter
stockmann
taking
one
thing
with
another
there
is
an
excellent
spirit
of
toleration
in
the
town
an
admirable
municipal
spirit
and
it
all
springs
from
the
fact
of
our
having
a
great
common
interest
to
unite
us
an
interest
that
is
in
an
equally
high
degree
the
concern
of
every
citizen
hovstad
the
baths
yes
peter
stockmann
exactly
fine
new
handsome
baths
mark
my
words
hovstad
the
baths
will
become
the
focus
of
our
municipal
life
not
a
doubt
of
it
stockmann
that
is
just
what
thomas
says
peter
stockmann
think
how
extraordinarily
the
place
has
developed
within
the
last
year
or
two
money
has
been
flowing
in
and
there
is
some
life
and
some
business
doing
in
the
town
houses
and
landed
property
are
rising
in
value
every
day
hovstad
and
unemployment
is
diminishing
peter
stockmann
yes
that
is
another
thing
the
burden
on
the
poor
rates
has
been
lightened
to
the
great
relief
of
the
propertied
classes
and
that
relief
will
be
even
greater
if
only
we
get
a
really
good
summer
this
year
and
lots
of
visitors
plenty
of
invalids
who
will
make
the
baths
talked
about
hovstad
and
there
is
a
good
prospect
of
that
i
hear
peter
stockmann
it
looks
very
promising
inquiries
about
apartments
and
that
sort
of
thing
are
reaching
us
every
day
hovstad
well
the
doctor
article
will
come
in
very
suitably
peter
stockmann
has
he
been
writing
something
just
lately
hovstad
this
is
something
he
wrote
in
the
winter
a
recommendation
of
the
baths
an
account
of
the
excellent
sanitary
conditions
here
but
i
held
the
article
over
temporarily
peter
stockmann
ah
some
little
difficulty
about
it
i
suppose
hovstad
no
not
at
all
i
thought
it
would
be
better
to
wait
until
the
spring
because
it
is
just
at
this
time
that
people
begin
to
think
seriously
about
their
summer
quarters
peter
stockmann
quite
right
you
were
perfectly
right
hovstad
hovstad
yes
thomas
is
really
indefatigable
when
it
is
a
question
of
the
baths
peter
stockmann
well
remember
he
is
the
medical
officer
to
the
baths
hovstad
yes
and
what
is
more
they
owe
their
existence
to
him
peter
stockmann
to
him
indeed
it
is
true
i
have
heard
from
time
to
time
that
some
people
are
of
that
opinion
at
the
same
time
i
must
say
i
imagined
that
i
took
a
modest
part
in
the
enterprise
stockmann
yes
that
is
what
thomas
is
always
saying
hovstad
but
who
denies
it
stockmann
you
set
the
thing
going
and
made
a
practical
concern
of
it
we
all
know
that
i
only
meant
that
the
idea
of
it
came
first
from
the
doctor
peter
stockmann
oh
ideas
yes
my
brother
has
had
plenty
of
them
in
his
time
unfortunately
but
when
it
is
a
question
of
putting
an
idea
into
practical
shape
you
have
to
apply
to
a
man
of
different
mettle
hovstad
and
i
certainly
should
have
thought
that
in
this
house
at
least
stockmann
my
dear
peter
hovstad
how
can
you
think
that
stockmann
wo
you
go
in
and
have
something
hovstad
my
husband
is
sure
to
be
back
directly
hovstad
thank
you
perhaps
just
a
morsel
goes
into
the
peter
stockmann
lowering
his
voice
a
little
it
is
a
curious
thing
that
these
farmers
sons
never
seem
to
lose
their
want
of
tact
stockmann
surely
it
is
not
worth
bothering
about
can
not
you
and
thomas
share
the
credit
as
brothers
peter
stockmann
i
should
have
thought
so
but
apparently
some
people
are
not
satisfied
with
a
share
stockmann
what
nonsense
you
and
thomas
get
on
so
capitally
together
listens
there
he
is
at
last
i
think
goes
out
and
opens
the
door
leading
to
the
hall
stockmann
laughing
and
talking
outside
look
here
here
is
another
guest
for
you
katherine
is
that
jolly
come
in
captain
horster
hang
your
coat
up
on
this
peg
ah
you
do
wear
an
overcoat
just
think
katherine
i
met
him
in
the
street
and
could
hardly
persuade
him
to
come
up
captain
horster
comes
into
the
room
and
greets
stockmann
he
is
followed
by
dr
stockmann
come
along
in
boys
they
are
ravenously
hungry
again
you
know
come
along
captain
horster
you
must
have
a
slice
of
beef
pushes
horster
into
the
ejlif
and
morten
go
in
after
them
stockmann
but
thomas
do
you
see
stockmann
turning
in
the
doorway
oh
is
it
you
peter
shakes
hands
with
him
now
that
is
very
delightful
peter
stockmann
unfortunately
i
must
go
in
a
moment
stockmann
rubbish
there
is
some
toddy
just
coming
in
you
forgotten
the
toddy
katherine
stockmann
of
course
not
the
water
is
boiling
now
goes
into
the
peter
stockmann
toddy
too
stockmann
yes
sit
down
and
we
will
have
it
comfortably
peter
stockmann
thanks
i
never
care
about
an
evening
drinking
stockmann
but
this
is
an
evening
drinking
peter
stockmann
it
seems
to
me
looks
towards
the
it
is
extraordinary
how
they
can
put
away
all
that
food
stockmann
rubbing
his
hands
yes
is
it
splendid
to
see
young
people
eat
they
have
always
got
an
appetite
you
know
that
as
it
should
be
lots
of
food
to
build
up
their
strength
they
are
the
people
who
are
going
to
stir
up
the
fermenting
forces
of
the
future
peter
peter
stockmann
may
i
ask
what
they
will
find
here
to
stir
up
as
you
put
it
stockmann
ah
you
must
ask
the
young
people
that
when
the
times
comes
we
sha
be
able
to
see
it
of
course
that
stands
to
reason
two
old
fogies
like
us
peter
stockmann
really
really
i
must
say
that
is
an
extremely
odd
expression
to
stockmann
oh
you
must
take
me
too
literally
peter
i
am
so
heartily
happy
and
contented
you
know
i
think
it
is
such
an
extraordinary
piece
of
good
fortune
to
be
in
the
middle
of
all
this
growing
germinating
life
it
is
a
splendid
time
to
live
in
it
is
as
if
a
whole
new
world
were
being
created
around
one
peter
stockmann
do
you
really
think
so
stockmann
ah
naturally
you
ca
appreciate
it
as
keenly
as
i
you
have
lived
all
your
life
in
these
surroundings
and
your
impressions
have
been
blunted
but
i
who
have
been
buried
all
these
years
in
my
little
corner
up
north
almost
without
ever
seeing
a
stranger
who
might
bring
new
ideas
with
him
well
in
my
case
it
has
just
the
same
effect
as
if
i
had
been
transported
into
the
middle
of
a
crowded
city
peter
stockmann
oh
a
city
stockmann
i
know
i
know
it
is
all
cramped
enough
here
compared
with
many
other
places
but
there
is
life
here
there
is
promise
there
are
innumerable
things
to
work
for
and
fight
for
and
that
is
the
main
thing
calls
katherine
has
the
postman
been
here
stockmann
from
the
no
stockmann
and
then
to
be
comfortably
off
peter
that
is
something
one
learns
to
value
when
one
has
been
on
the
brink
of
starvation
as
we
have
peter
stockmann
oh
surely
stockmann
indeed
i
can
assure
you
we
have
often
been
very
hard
put
to
it
up
there
and
now
to
be
able
to
live
like
a
lord
today
for
instance
we
had
roast
beef
for
dinner
and
what
is
more
for
supper
too
wo
you
come
and
have
a
little
bit
or
let
me
show
it
you
at
any
rate
come
here
peter
stockmann
no
no
not
for
worlds
stockmann
well
but
just
come
here
then
do
you
see
we
have
got
a
peter
stockmann
yes
i
noticed
it
stockmann
and
we
have
got
a
too
do
you
see
all
out
of
katherine
savings
it
makes
the
room
so
cosy
do
you
think
so
just
stand
here
for
a
moment
no
no
not
there
just
here
that
it
look
now
when
you
get
the
light
on
it
altogether
i
really
think
it
looks
very
nice
does
it
peter
stockmann
oh
if
you
can
afford
luxuries
of
this
kind
stockmann
yes
i
can
afford
it
now
katherine
tells
me
i
earn
almost
as
much
as
we
spend
peter
stockmann
almost
yes
stockmann
but
a
scientific
man
must
live
in
a
little
bit
of
style
i
am
quite
sure
an
ordinary
civil
servant
spends
more
in
a
year
than
i
do
peter
stockmann
i
daresay
a
civil
servant
a
man
in
a
position
stockmann
well
any
ordinary
merchant
then
a
man
in
that
position
spends
two
or
three
times
as
much
as
peter
stockmann
it
just
depends
on
circumstances
stockmann
at
all
events
i
assure
you
i
do
waste
money
unprofitably
but
i
ca
find
it
in
my
heart
to
deny
myself
the
pleasure
of
entertaining
my
friends
i
need
that
sort
of
thing
you
know
i
have
lived
for
so
long
shut
out
of
it
all
that
it
is
a
necessity
of
life
to
me
to
mix
with
young
eager
ambitious
men
men
of
liberal
and
active
minds
and
that
describes
every
one
of
those
fellows
who
are
enjoying
their
supper
in
there
i
wish
you
knew
more
of
hovstad
peter
stockmann
by
the
way
hovstad
was
telling
me
he
was
going
to
print
another
article
of
yours
stockmann
an
article
of
mine
peter
stockmann
yes
about
the
baths
an
article
you
wrote
in
the
winter
stockmann
oh
that
one
no
i
do
intend
that
to
appear
just
for
the
present
peter
stockmann
why
not
it
seems
to
me
that
this
would
be
the
most
opportune
moment
stockmann
yes
very
likely
under
normal
conditions
crosses
the
room
peter
stockmann
following
him
with
his
eyes
is
there
anything
abnormal
about
the
present
conditions
stockmann
standing
still
to
tell
you
the
truth
peter
i
say
just
at
this
moment
at
all
events
not
tonight
there
may
be
much
that
is
very
abnormal
about
the
present
conditions
and
it
is
possible
there
may
be
nothing
abnormal
about
them
at
all
it
is
quite
possible
it
may
be
merely
my
imagination
peter
stockmann
i
must
say
it
all
sounds
most
mysterious
is
there
something
going
on
that
i
am
to
be
kept
in
ignorance
of
i
should
have
imagined
that
i
as
chairman
of
the
governing
body
of
the
baths
stockmann
and
i
should
have
imagined
that
i
oh
come
do
let
us
fly
out
at
one
another
peter
peter
stockmann
heaven
forbid
i
am
not
in
the
habit
of
flying
out
at
people
as
you
call
it
but
i
am
entitled
to
request
most
emphatically
that
all
arrangements
shall
be
made
in
a
businesslike
manner
through
the
proper
channels
and
shall
be
dealt
with
by
the
legally
constituted
authorities
i
can
allow
no
going
behind
our
backs
by
any
roundabout
means
stockmann
have
i
ever
at
any
time
tried
to
go
behind
your
backs
peter
stockmann
you
have
an
ingrained
tendency
to
take
your
own
way
at
all
events
and
that
is
almost
equally
inadmissible
in
a
well
ordered
community
the
individual
ought
undoubtedly
to
acquiesce
in
subordinating
himself
to
the
community
or
to
speak
more
accurately
to
the
authorities
who
have
the
care
of
the
community
welfare
stockmann
very
likely
but
what
the
deuce
has
all
this
got
to
do
with
me
peter
stockmann
that
is
exactly
what
you
never
appear
to
be
willing
to
learn
my
dear
thomas
but
mark
my
words
some
day
you
will
have
to
suffer
for
it
sooner
or
later
now
i
have
told
you
stockmann
have
you
taken
leave
of
your
senses
you
are
on
the
wrong
scent
altogether

proper
time
stockmann
what
have
you
got
to
make
a
report
to
him
about
stockmann
hm
leave
that
to
me
katherine
it
is
an
extraordinary
thing
that
the
postman
does
come
hovstad
billing
and
horster
have
got
up
from
the
table
and
come
into
the
ejlif
and
morten
come
in
after
them
billing
stretching
himself
ah
one
feels
a
new
man
after
a
meal
like
that
hovstad
the
mayor
was
in
a
very
sweet
temper
tonight
then
stockmann
it
is
his
stomach
he
has
wretched
digestion
hovstad
i
rather
think
it
was
us
two
of
the
people
messenger
that
he
could
digest
stockmann
i
thought
you
came
out
of
it
pretty
well
with
him
hovstad
oh
yes
but
it
is
anything
more
than
a
sort
of
truce
billing
that
is
just
what
it
is
that
word
sums
up
the
situation
stockmann
we
must
remember
that
peter
is
a
lonely
man
poor
chap
he
has
no
home
comforts
of
any
kind
nothing
but
everlasting
business
and
all
that
infernal
weak
tea
wash
that
he
pours
into
himself
now
then
my
boys
bring
chairs
up
to
the
table
are
we
going
to
have
that
toddy

stockmann
there

pipe
the
two
boys
go
into
the
room
on
the
right
i
have
a
suspicion
that
ejlif
pockets
a
cigar
now
and
then
but
i
take
no
notice
of
it
calls
out
and
my
too
morten
katherine
you
can
tell
him
where
i
left
it
ah
he
has
got
it
the
boys
bring
the
various
things
now
my
friends
i
stick
to
my
pipe
you
know
this
one
has
seen
plenty
of
bad
weather
with
me
up
north
touches
glasses
with
them
your
good
health
ah
it
is
good
to
be
sitting
snug
and
warm
here
stockmann
who
sits
knitting
do
you
sail
soon
captain
horster
horster
i
expect
to
be
ready
to
sail
next
week
stockmann
i
suppose
you
are
going
to
america
horster
yes
that
is
the
plan
stockmann
then
you
wo
be
able
to
take
part
in
the
coming
election
horster
is
there
going
to
be
an
election
billing
did
you
know
horster
no
i
do
mix
myself
up
with
those
things
billing
but
do
you
not
take
an
interest
in
public
affairs
horster
no
i
do
know
anything
about
politics
billing
all
the
same
one
ought
to
vote
at
any
rate
horster
even
if
one
does
know
anything
about
what
is
going
on
billing
does
know
what
do
you
mean
by
that
a
community
is
like
a
ship
everyone
ought
to
be
prepared
to
take
the
helm
horster
maybe
that
is
all
very
well
on
shore
but
on
board
ship
it
would
work
hovstad
it
is
astonishing
how
little
most
sailors
care
about
what
goes
on
on
shore
billing
very
extraordinary
stockmann
sailors
are
like
birds
of
passage
they
feel
equally
at
home
in
any
latitude
and
that
is
only
an
additional
reason
for
our
being
all
the
more
keen
hovstad
is
there
to
be
anything
of
public
interest
in
tomorrow
messenger
hovstad
nothing
about
municipal
affairs
but
the
day
after
tomorrow
i
was
thinking
of
printing
your
article
stockmann
ah
devil
take
it
my
article
look
here
that
must
wait
a
bit
hovstad
really
we

just
got
convenient
space
for
it
and
i
thought
it
was
just
the
opportune
moment
stockmann
yes
yes
very
likely
you
are
right
but
it
must
wait
all
the
same
i
will
explain
to
you
later

last
day

postman

some
country
patient
petra
poor
old
dad

will
overwork
himself

glass

taste

hours
of
school

hours

delightfully
tired

be
dreadfully
wicked

duffer

are
to
believe

thing
like
that
stockmann
come

laughing
that
capital
hovstad
do
you
want
to
work
as
hard
as
that
morten
morten
no
indeed
i
do
hovstad
what
do
you
want
to
be
then
morten
i
should
like
best
to
be
a
viking
ejlif
you
would
have
to
be
a
pagan
then
morten
well
i
could
become
a
pagan
could
i
billing
i
agree
with
you
morten
my
sentiments
exactly
stockmann
signalling
to
him
i
am
sure
that
is
not
true
mr
billing
billing
yes
i
swear
it
is
i
am
a
pagan
and
i
am
proud
of
it
believe
me
before
long
we
shall
all
be
pagans
morten
and
then
shall
be
allowed
to
do
anything
we
like
billing
well
you
see
morten
stockmann
you
must
go
to
your
room
now
boys
i
am
sure
you
have
some
lessons
to
learn
for
tomorrow
ejlif
i
should
like
so
much
to
stay
a
little
longer
stockmann
no
no
away
you
go
both
of
you
the
boys
say
good
night
and
go
into
the
room
on
the
left
hovstad
do
you
really
think
it
can
do
the
boys
any
harm
to
hear
such
things
stockmann
i
do
know
but
i
do
like
it
petra
but
you
know
mother
i
think
you
really
are
wrong
about
it
stockmann
maybe
but
i
do
like
it
not
in
our
own
home
petra
there
is
so
much
falsehood
both
at
home
and
at
school
at
home
one
must
not
speak
and
at
school
we
have
to
stand
and
tell
lies
to
the
children
horster
tell
lies
petra
yes
do
you
suppose
we
have
to
teach
them
all
sorts
of
things
that
we
do
believe
billing
that
is
perfectly
true
petra
if
only
i
had
the
means
i
would
start
a
school
of
my
own
and
it
would
be
conducted
on
very
different
lines
billing
oh
bother
the
means
horster
well
if
you
are
thinking
of
that
miss
stockmann
i
shall
be
delighted
to
provide
you
with
a
schoolroom
the
great
big
old
house
my
father
left
me
is
standing
almost
empty
there
is
an
immense
downstairs
petra
laughing
thank
you
very
much
but
i
am
afraid
nothing
will
come
of
it
hovstad
no
miss
petra
is
much
more
likely
to
take
to
journalism
i
expect
by
the
way
have
you
had
time
to
do
anything
with
that
english
story
you
promised
to
translate
for
us
petra
no
not
yet
but
you
shall
have
it
in
good
time
stockmann
comes
in
from
his
room
with
an
open
letter
in
his
hand
stockmann
waving
the
letter
well
now
the
town
will
have
something
new
to
talk
about
i
can
tell
you
billing
something
new
stockmann
what
is
this
stockmann
a
great
discovery
katherine
hovstad
really
stockmann
a
discovery
of
yours
stockmann
a
discovery
of
mine
walks
up
and
down
just
let
them
come
saying
as
usual
that
it
is
all
fancy
and
a
crazy
imagination
but
they
will
be
careful
what
they
say
this
time
i
can
tell
you
petra
but
father
tell
us
what
it
is
stockmann
yes
yes
only
give
me
time
and
you
shall
know
all
about
it
if
only
i
had
peter
here
now
it
just
shows
how
we
men
can
go
about
forming
our
judgments
when
in
reality
we
are
as
blind
as
any
moles
hovstad
what
are
you
driving
at
doctor
stockmann
standing
still
by
the
table
is
it
the
universal
opinion
that
our
town
is
a
healthy
spot
hovstad
certainly
stockmann
quite
an
unusually
healthy
spot
in
fact
a
place
that
deserves
to
be
recommended
in
the
warmest
possible
manner
either
for
invalids
or
for
people
who
are
well
stockmann
yes
but
my
dear
thomas
stockmann
and
we
have
been
recommending
it
and
praising
it
i
have
written
and
written
both
in
the
messenger
and
in
pamphlets
hovstad
well
what
then
stockmann
and
the
baths
we
have
called
them
the
main
artery
of
the
town
the
of
our
town
and
the
devil
knows
what
else
billing
the
town
pulsating
heart
was
the
expression
i
once
used
on
an
important
occasion
stockmann
quite
so
well
do
you
know
what
they
really
are
these
great
splendid
much
praised
baths
that
have
cost
so
much
money
do
you
know
what
they
are
hovstad
no
what
are
they
stockmann
yes
what
are
they
stockmann
the
whole
place
is
a
petra
the
baths
father
stockmann
at
the
same
time
our
baths
hovstad
but
doctor
billing
absolutely
incredible
stockmann
the
whole
bath
establishment
is
a
whited
poisoned
sepulchre
i
tell
you
the
gravest
possible
danger
to
the
public
health
all
the
nastiness
up
at
molledal
all
that
stinking
filth
is
infecting
the
water
in
the
leading
to
the
reservoir
and
the
same
cursed
filthy
poison
oozes
out
on
the
shore
too
horster
where
the
is
stockmann
just
there
hovstad
how
do
you
come
to
be
so
certain
of
all
this
doctor
stockmann
i
have
investigated
the
matter
most
conscientiously
for
a
long
time
past
i
have
suspected
something
of
the
kind
last
year
we
had
some
very
strange
cases
of
illness
among
the
visitors
typhoid
cases
and
cases
of
gastric
fever
stockmann
yes
that
is
quite
true
stockmann
at
the
time
we
supposed
the
visitors
had
been
infected
before
they
came
but
later
on
in
the
winter
i
began
to
have
a
different
opinion
and
so
i
set
myself
to
examine
the
water
as
well
as
i
could
stockmann
then
that
is
what
you
have
been
so
busy
with
stockmann
indeed
i
have
been
busy
katherine
but
here
i
had
none
of
the
necessary
scientific
apparatus
so
i
sent
samples
both
of
the
and
of
the
up
to
the
university
to
have
an
accurate
analysis
made
by
a
chemist
hovstad
and
have
you
got
that
stockmann
showing
him
the
letter
here
it
is
it
proves
the
presence
of
decomposing
organic
matter
in
the
water
it
is
full
of
infusoria
the
water
is
absolutely
dangerous
to
use
either
internally
or
externally
stockmann
what
a
mercy
you
discovered
it
in
time
stockmann
you
may
well
say
so
hovstad
and
what
do
you
propose
to
do
now
doctor
stockmann
to
see
the
matter
put
right
naturally
hovstad
can
that
be
done
stockmann
it
must
be
done
otherwise
the
baths
will
be
absolutely
useless
and
wasted
but
we
need
not
anticipate
that
i
have
a
very
clear
idea
what
we
shall
have
to
do
stockmann
but
why
have
you
kept
this
all
so
secret
dear
stockmann
do
you
suppose
i
was
going
to
run
about
the
town
gossiping
about
it
before
i
had
absolute
proof
no
thank
you
i
am
not
such
a
fool
petra
still
you
might
have
told
us
stockmann
not
a
living
soul
but
tomorrow
you
may
run
around
to
the
old
badger
stockmann
oh
thomas
thomas
stockmann
well
to
your
grandfather
then
the
old
boy
will
have
something
to
be
astonished
at
i
know
he
thinks
i
am
cracked
and
there
are
lots
of
other
people
who
think
so
too
i
have
noticed
but
now
these
good
folks
shall
see
they
shall
just
see
walks
about
rubbing
his
hands
there
will
be
a
nice
upset
in
the
town
katherine
you
ca
imagine
what
it
will
be
all
the
will
have
to
be
relaid
hovstad
getting
up
all
the
stockmann
yes
of
course
the
intake
is
too
low
down
it
will
have
to
be
lifted
to
a
position
much
higher
up
petra
then
you
were
right
after
all
stockmann
ah
you
remember
petra
i
wrote
opposing
the
plans
before
the
work
was
begun
but
at
that
time
no
one
would
listen
to
me
well
i
am
going
to
let
them
have
it
now
of
course
i
have
prepared
a
report
for
the
baths
committee
i
have
had
it
ready
for
a
week
and
was
only
waiting
for
this
to
come
shows
the
letter
now
it
shall
go
off
at
once
goes
into
his
room
and
comes
back
with
some
papers
look
at
that
four
closely
written
sheets
and
the
letter
shall
go
with
them
give
me
a
bit
of
paper
katherine
something
to
wrap
them
up
in
that
will
do
now
give
it
stamps
his
foot
what
the
deuce
is
her
name
give
it
to
the
maid
and
tell
her
to
take
it
at
once
to
the
mayor
stockmann
takes
the
packet
and
goes
out
through
the
petra
what
do
you
think
uncle
peter
will
say
father
stockmann
what
is
there
for
him
to
say
i
should
think
he
would
be
very
glad
that
such
an
important
truth
has
been
brought
to
light
hovstad
will
you
let
me
print
a
short
note
about
your
discovery
in
the
messenger
stockmann
i
shall
be
very
much
obliged
if
you
will
hovstad
it
is
very
desirable
that
the
public
should
be
informed
of
it
without
delay
stockmann
certainly
stockmann
coming
back
she
has
just
gone
with
it
billing
upon
my
soul
doctor

his
pocket

that

about
midday
stockmann

this
time
stockmann
that

be
all
right
i
have
got
through
all
my
morning
visits

i
am
extremely
curious
to
know
how
he
takes
it
stockmann
you
will
see
he
wo
like
it
having
been
i
and
not
he
that
made
the
discovery
stockmann
are
you
a
little
nervous
about
that
stockmann
oh
he
really
will
be
pleased
enough
you
know
but
at
the
same
time
peter
is
so
confoundedly
afraid
of
anyone
doing
any
service
to
the
town
except
himself
stockmann
i
will
tell
you
what
thomas
you
should
be
good
natured
and
share
the
credit
of
this
with
him
could
you
make
out
that
it
was
he
who
set
you
on
the
scent
of
this
discovery
stockmann
i
am
quite
willing
if
only
i
can
get
the
thing
set
right
i
morten
kiil
puts
his
head
in
through
the
door
leading
from
the
hall
looks
around
in
an
enquiring
manner
and
chuckles
morten
kiil
slyly
is
it
is
it
true
stockmann
going
to
the
door
father
is
it
you
stockmann
ah
kiil
good
morning
good
morning
stockmann
but
come
along
in
morten
kiil
if
it
is
true
i
will
if
not
i
am
off
stockmann
if
what
is
true
morten
kiil
this
tale
about
the
water
supply
is
it
true
stockmann
certainly
it
is
true
but
how
did
you
come
to
hear
it
morten
kiil
coming
in
petra
ran
in
on
her
way
to
the
school
stockmann
did
she
morten
kiil
yes
and
she
declares
that
i
thought
she
was
only
making
a
fool
of
me
but
it
is
like
petra
to
do
that
stockmann
of
course
not
how
could
you
imagine
such
a
thing
morten
kiil
oh
well
it
is
better
never
to
trust
anybody
you
may
find
you
have
been
made
a
fool
of
before
you
know
where
you
are
but
it
is
really
true
all
the
same
stockmann
you
can
depend
upon
it
that
it
is
true
wo
you
sit
down
settles
him
on
the
couch
is
it
a
real
bit
of
luck
for
the
town
morten
kiil
suppressing
his
laughter
a
bit
of
luck
for
the
town
stockmann
yes
that
i
made
the
discovery
in
good
time
morten
kiil
as
before
yes
yes
yes
but
i
should
never
have
thought
you
the
sort
of
man
to
pull
your
own
brother
leg
like
this
stockmann
pull
his
leg
stockmann
really
father
dear
morten
kiil
resting
his
hands
and
his
chin
on
the
handle
of
his
stick
and
winking
slyly
at
the
doctor
let
me
see
what
was
the
story
some
kind
of
beast
that
had
got
into
the
was
it
stockmann
infusoria
yes
morten
kiil
and
a
lot
of
these
beasts
had
got
in
according
to
petra
a
tremendous
lot
stockmann
certainly
hundreds
of
thousands
of
them
probably
morten
kiil
but
no
one
can
see
them
is
that
so
stockmann
yes
you
ca
see
them
morten
kiil
with
a
quiet
chuckle
damn
it
the
finest
story
i
have
ever
heard
stockmann
what
do
you
mean
morten
kiil
but
you
will
never
get
the
mayor
to
believe
a
thing
like
that
stockmann
we
shall
see
morten
kiil
do
you
think
he
will
be
fool
enough
to
stockmann
i
hope
the
whole
town
will
be
fools
enough
morten
kiil
the
whole
town
well
it
would
be
a
bad
thing
it
would
just
serve
them
right
and
teach
them
a
lesson
they
think
themselves
so
much
cleverer
than
we
old
fellows
they
hounded
me
out
of
the
council
they
did
i
tell
you
they
hounded
me
out
now
they
shall
pay
for
it
you
pull
their
legs
too
thomas
stockmann
really
i
morten
kiil
you
pull
their
legs
gets
up
if
you
can
work
it
so
that
the
mayor
and
his
friends
all
swallow
the
same
bait
i
will
give
ten
pounds
to
a
charity
like
a
shot
stockmann
that
is
very
kind
of
you
morten
kiil
yes
i
have
got
much
money
to
throw
away
i
can
tell
you
but
if
you
can
work
this
i
will
give
five
pounds
to
a
charity
at
christmas
hovstad
comes
in
by
the
hall
door
hovstad
good
morning
stops
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
stockmann
not
at
all
come
in
morten
kiil
with
another
chuckle
oho
is
he
in
this
too
hovstad
what
do
you
mean
stockmann
certainly
he
is
morten
kiil
i
might
have
known
it
it
must
get
into
the
papers
you
know
how
to
do
it
thomas
set
your
wits
to
work
now
i
must
go
stockmann
wo
you
stay
a
little
while
morten
kiil
no
i
must
be
off
now
you
keep
up
this
game
for
all
it
is
worth
you
wo
repent
it
i
damned
if
you
will
he
goes
out
stockmann
follows
him
into
the
hall
stockmann
laughing
just
imagine
the
old
chap
does
believe
a
word
of
all
this
about
the
water
supply
hovstad
oh
that
was
it
then
stockmann
yes
that
was
what
we
were
talking
about
perhaps
it
is
the
same
thing
that
brings
you
here
hovstad
yes
it
is
can
you
spare
me
a
few
minutes
doctor
stockmann
as
long
as
you
like
my
dear
fellow
hovstad
have
you
heard
from
the
mayor
yet
stockmann
not
yet
he
is
coming
here
later
hovstad
i
have
given
the
matter
a
great
deal
of
thought
since
last
night
stockmann
well
hovstad
from
your
point
of
view
as
a
doctor
and
a
man
of
science
this
affair
of
the
water
supply
is
an
isolated
matter
i
mean
you
do
not
realise
that
it
involves
a
great
many
other
things
stockmann
how
do
you
mean
let
us
sit
down
my
dear
fellow
no
sit
here
on
the
couch
hovstad
sits
down
on
the
couch
stockmann
on
a
chair
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
now
then
you
mean
that
hovstad
you
said
yesterday
that
the
pollution
of
the
water
was
due
to
impurities
in
the
soil
stockmann
yes
unquestionably
it
is
due
to
that
poisonous
morass
up
at
molledal
hovstad
begging
your
pardon
doctor
i
fancy
it
is
due
to
quite
another
morass
altogether
stockmann
what
morass
hovstad
the
morass
that
the
whole
life
of
our
town
is
built
on
and
is
rotting
in
stockmann
what
the
deuce
are
you
driving
at
hovstad
hovstad
the
whole
of
the
town
interests
have
little
by
little
got
into
the
hands
of
a
pack
of
officials
stockmann
oh
come
they
are
not
all
officials
hovstad
no
but
those
that
are
not
officials
are
at
any
rate
the
officials
friends
and
adherents
it
is
the
wealthy
folk
the
old
families
in
the
town
that
have
got
us
entirely
in
their
hands
stockmann
yes
but
after
all
they
are
men
of
ability
and
knowledge
hovstad
did
they
show
any
ability
or
knowledge
when
they
laid
the
conduit
pipes
where
they
are
now
stockmann
no
of
course
that
was
a
great
piece
of
stupidity
on
their
part
but
that
is
going
to
be
set
right
now
hovstad
do
you
think
that
will
be
all
such
plain
sailing
stockmann
plain
sailing
or
no
it
has
got
to
be
done
anyway
hovstad
yes
provided
the
press
takes
up
the
question
stockmann
i
do
think
that
will
be
necessary
my
dear
fellow
i
am
certain
my
brother
hovstad
excuse
me
doctor
i
feel
bound
to
tell
you
i
am
inclined
to
take
the
matter
up
stockmann
in
the
paper
hovstad
yes
when
i
took
over
the
people
messenger
my
idea
was
to
break
up
this
ring
of
old
fossils
who
had
got
hold
of
all
the
influence
stockmann
but
you
know
you
told
me
yourself
what
the
result
had
been
you
nearly
ruined
your
paper
hovstad
yes
at
the
time
we
were
obliged
to
climb
down
a
peg
or
two
it
is
quite
true
because
there
was
a
danger
of
the
whole
project
of
the
baths
coming
to
nothing
if
they
failed
us
but
now
the
scheme
has
been
carried
through
and
we
can
dispense
with
these
grand
gentlemen
stockmann
dispense
with
them
yes
but
we
owe
them
a
great
debt
of
gratitude
hovstad
that
shall
be
recognised
ungrudgingly
but
a
journalist
of
my
democratic
tendencies
can
not
let
such
an
opportunity
as
this
slip
the
bubble
of
official
infallibility
must
be
pricked
this
superstition
must
be
destroyed
like
any
other
stockmann
i
am
with
you
in
that
hovstad
if
it
is
a
superstition
away
with
it
hovstad
i
should
be
very
reluctant
to
bring
the
mayor
into
it
because
he
is
your
brother
but
i
am
sure
you
will
agree
with
me
that
truth
should
be
the
first
consideration
stockmann
that
goes
without
saying
with
sudden
emphasis
yes
but
but
hovstad
you
must
not
misjudge
me
i
am
neither
more
nor
more
ambitious
than
most
men
stockmann
my
dear
fellow
who
suggests
anything
of
the
kind
hovstad
i
am
of
humble
origin
as
you
know
and
that
has
given
me
opportunities
of
knowing
what
is
the
most
crying
need
in
the
humbler
ranks
of
life
it
is
that
they
should
be
allowed
some
part
in
the
direction
of
public
affairs
doctor
that
is
what
will
develop
their
faculties
and
intelligence
and
self
respect
stockmann
i
quite
appreciate
that
hovstad
yes
and
in
my
opinion
a
journalist
incurs
a
heavy
responsibility
if
he
neglects
a
favourable
opportunity
of
emancipating
the
masses
the
humble
and
oppressed
i
know
well
enough
that
in
exalted
circles
i
shall
be
called
an
agitator
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
but
they
may
call
what
they
like
if
only
my
conscience
reproach
me
then
stockmann
quite
right
quite
right
hovstad
but
all
the
same
devil
take
it
a
knock
is
heard
at
the
door
come
in
aslaksen
appears
at
the
door
he
is
poorly
but
decently
dressed
in
black
with
a
slightly
crumpled
white
neckcloth
he
wears
gloves
and
has
a
felt
hat
in
his
hand
aslaksen
bowing
excuse
my
taking
the
liberty
doctor
stockmann
getting
up
ah
it
is
you
aslaksen
aslaksen
yes
doctor
hovstad
standing
up
is
it
me
you
want
aslaksen
aslaksen
no
i
did
know
i
should
find
you
here
no
it
was
the
doctor
i
stockmann
i
am
quite
at
your
service
what
is
it
aslaksen
is
what
i
heard
from
mr
billing
true
sir
that
you
mean
to
improve
our
water
supply
stockmann
yes
for
the
baths
aslaksen
quite
so
i
understand
well
i
have
come
to
say
that
i
will
back
that
up
by
every
means
in
my
power
hovstad
to
the
doctor
you
see
stockmann
i
shall
be
very
grateful
to
you
but
aslaksen
because
it
may
be
no
bad
thing
to
have
us
small
tradesmen
at
your
back
we
form
as
it
were
a
compact
majority
in
the
town
if
we
choose
and
it
is
always
a
good
thing
to
have
the
majority
with
you
doctor
stockmann
that
is
undeniably
true
but
i
confess
i
do
see
why
such
unusual
precautions
should
be
necessary
in
this
case
it
seems
to
me
that
such
a
plain
straightforward
thing
aslaksen
oh
it
may
be
very
desirable
all
the
same
i
know
our
local
authorities
so
well
officials
are
not
generally
very
ready
to
act
on
proposals
that
come
from
other
people
that
is
why
i
think
it
would
not
be
at
all
amiss
if
we
made
a
little
demonstration
hovstad
that
right
stockmann
demonstration
did
you
say
what
on
earth
are
you
going
to
make
a
demonstration
about
aslaksen
we
shall
proceed
with
the
greatest
moderation
doctor
moderation
is
always
my
aim
it
is
the
greatest
virtue
in
a
citizen
at
least
i
think
so
stockmann
it
is
well
known
to
be
a
characteristic
of
yours
aslaksen
aslaksen
yes
i
think
i
may
pride
myself
on
that
and
this
matter
of
the
water
supply
is
of
the
greatest
importance
to
us
small
tradesmen
the
baths
promise
to
be
a
regular
for
the
town
we
shall
all
make
our
living
out
of
them
especially
those
of
us
who
are
householders
that
is
why
we
will
back
up
the
project
as
strongly
as
possible
and
as
i
am
at
present
chairman
of
the
association
stockmann
yes
aslaksen
and
what
is
more
local
secretary
of
the
temperance
society
you
know
sir
i
suppose
that
i
am
a
worker
in
the
temperance
cause
stockmann
of
course
of
course
aslaksen
well
you
can
understand
that
i
come
into
contact
with
a
great
many
people
and
as
i
have
the
reputation
of
a
temperate
and
citizen
like
yourself
doctor
i
have
a
certain
influence
in
the
town
a
little
bit
of
power
if
i
may
be
allowed
to
say
so
stockmann
i
know
that
quite
well
aslaksen
aslaksen
so
you
see
it
would
be
an
easy
matter
for
me
to
set
on
foot
some
testimonial
if
necessary
stockmann
a
testimonial
aslaksen
yes
some
kind
of
an
address
of
thanks
from
the
townsmen
for
your
share
in
a
matter
of
such
importance
to
the
community
i
need
scarcely
say
that
it
would
have
to
be
drawn
up
with
the
greatest
regard
to
moderation
so
as
not
to
offend
the
authorities
who
after
all
have
the
reins
in
their
hands
if
we
pay
strict
attention
to
that
no
one
can
take
it
amiss
i
should
think
hovstad
well
and
even
supposing
they
did
like
it
aslaksen
no
no
no
there
must
be
no
discourtesy
to
the
authorities
hovstad
it
is
no
use
falling
foul
of
those
upon
whom
our
welfare
so
closely
depends
i
have
done
that
in
my
time
and
no
good
ever
comes
of
it
but
no
one
can
take
exception
to
a
reasonable
and
frank
expression
of
a
citizen
views
stockmann
shaking
him
by
the
hand
i
ca
tell
you
dear
aslaksen
how
extremely
pleased
i
am
to
find
such
hearty
support
among
my
i
am
delighted
delighted
now
you
will
take
a
small
glass
of
sherry
eh
aslaksen
no
thank
you
i
never
drink
alcohol
of
that
kind
stockmann
well
what
do
you
say
to
a
glass
of
beer
then
aslaksen
nor
that
either
thank
you
doctor
i
never
drink
anything
as
early
as
this
i
am
going
into
town
now
to
talk
this
over
with
one
or
two
householders
and
prepare
the
ground
stockmann
it
is
tremendously
kind
of
you
aslaksen
but
i
really
can
not
understand
the
necessity
for
all
these
precautions
it
seems
to
me
that
the
thing
should
go
of
itself
aslaksen
the
authorities
are
somewhat
slow
to
move
doctor
far
be
it
from
me
to
seem
to
blame
them
hovstad
we
are
going
to
stir
them
up
in
the
paper
tomorrow
aslaksen
aslaksen
but
not
violently
i
trust
hovstad
proceed
with
moderation
or
you
will
do
nothing
with
them
you
may
take
my
advice
i
have
gathered
my
experience
in
the
school
of
life
well
i
must
say
goodbye
doctor
you
know
now
that
we
small
tradesmen
are
at
your
back
at
all
events
like
a
solid
wall
you
have
the
compact
majority
on
your
side
doctor
stockmann
i
am
very
much
obliged
dear
aslaksen
shakes
hands
with
him
goodbye
goodbye
aslaksen
are
you
going
my
way
towards
the
hovstad
hovstad
i
will
come
later
i
have
something
to
settle
up
first
aslaksen
very
well
bows
and
goes
out
stockmann
follows
him
into
the
hall
hovstad
as
stockmann
comes
in
again
well
what
do
you
think
of
that
doctor
do
you
think
it
is
high
time
we
stirred
a
little
life
into
all
this
slackness
and
vacillation
and
cowardice
stockmann
are
you
referring
to
aslaksen
hovstad
yes
i
am
he
is
one
of
those
who
are
floundering
in
a
bog
decent
enough
fellow
though
he
may
be
otherwise
and
most
of
the
people
here
are
in
just
the
same
case
and
edging
first
to
one
side
and
then
to
the
other
so
overcome
with
caution
and
scruple
that
they
never
dare
to
take
any
decided
step
stockmann
yes
but
aslaksen
seemed
to
me
so
thoroughly
hovstad
there
is
one
thing
i
esteem
higher
than
that
and
that
is
for
a
man
to
be
and
sure
of
himself
stockmann
i
think
you
are
perfectly
right
there
hovstad
that
is
why
i
want
to
seize
this
opportunity
and
try
if
i
can
not
manage
to
put
a
little
virility
into
these
people
for
once
the
idol
of
authority
must
be
shattered
in
this
town
this
gross
and
inexcusable
blunder
about
the
water
supply
must
be
brought
home
to
the
mind
of
every
municipal
voter
stockmann
very
well
if
you
are
of
opinion
that
it
is
for
the
good
of
the
community
so
be
it
but
not
until
i
have
had
a
talk
with
my
brother
hovstad
anyway
i
will
get
a
leading
article
ready
and
if
the
mayor
refuses
to
take
the
matter
up
stockmann
how
can
you
suppose
such
a
thing
possible
hovstad
it
is
conceivable
and
in
that
case
stockmann
in
that
case
i
promise
you
look
here
in
that
case
you
may
print
my
report
every
word
of
it
hovstad
may
i
have
i
your
word
for
it
stockmann
giving
him
the
here
it
is
take
it
with
you
it
can
do
no
harm
for
you
to
read
it
through
and
you
can
give
it
me
back
later
on
hovstad
good
good
that
is
what
i
will
do
and
now
goodbye
doctor
stockmann
goodbye
goodbye
you
will
see
everything
will
run
quite
smoothly
hovstad
quite
smoothly
hovstad
hm
we
shall
see
bows
and
goes
out
stockmann
opens
the
door
and
looks
in
katherine
oh
you
are
back
petra
petra
coming
in
yes
i
have
just
come
from
the
school
stockmann
coming
in
has
he
not
been
here
yet
stockmann
peter
no
but
i
have
had
a
long
talk
with
hovstad
he
is
quite
excited
about
my
discovery
i
find
it
has
a
much
wider
bearing
than
i
at
first
imagined
and
he
has
put
his
paper
at
my
disposal
if
necessity
should
arise
stockmann
do
you
think
it
will
stockmann
not
for
a
moment
but
at
all
events
it
makes
me
feel
proud
to
know
that
i
have
the
independent
press
on
my
side
yes
and
just
imagine
i
have
had
a
visit
from
the
chairman
of
the
householders
association
stockmann
oh
what
did
he
want
stockmann
to
offer
me
his
support
too
they
will
support
me
in
a
body
if
it
should
be
necessary
katherine
do
you
know
what
i
have
got
behind
me
stockmann
behind
you
no
what
have
you
got
behind
you
stockmann
the
compact
majority
stockmann
really
is
that
a
good
thing
for
you
thomas
stockmann
i
should
think
it
was
a
good
thing
walks
up
and
down
rubbing
his
hands
by
jove
it
a
fine
thing
to
feel
this
bond
of
brotherhood
between
oneself
and
one
fellow
citizens
petra
and
to
be
able
to
do
so
much
that
is
good
and
useful
father
stockmann
and
for
one
own
native
town
into
the
bargain
my
child
stockmann
that
was
a
ring
at
the
bell
stockmann
it
must
be
he
then
a
knock
is
heard
at
the
door
come
in
peter
stockmann
comes
in
from
the
hall
good
morning
stockmann
glad
to
see
you
peter
stockmann
good
morning
peter
how
are
you
peter
stockmann
so
so
thank
you
to
dr
stockmann
i
received
from
you
yesterday
after
office
hours
a
report
dealing
with
the
condition
of
the
water
at
the
baths
stockmann
yes
have
you
read
it
peter
stockmann
yes
i
have
stockmann
and
what
have
you
to
say
to
it
peter
stockmann
with
a
sidelong
glance
hm
stockmann
come
along
petra
she
and
petra
go
into
the
room
on
the
left
peter
stockmann
after
a
pause
was
it
necessary
to
make
all
these
investigations
behind
my
back
stockmann
yes
because
until
i
was
absolutely
certain
about
it
peter
stockmann
then
you
mean
that
you
are
absolutely
certain
now
stockmann
surely
you
are
convinced
of
that
peter
stockmann
is
it
your
intention
to
bring
this
document
before
the
baths
committee
as
a
sort
of
official
communication
stockmann
certainly
something
must
be
done
in
the
matter
and
that
quickly
peter
stockmann
as
usual
you
employ
violent
expressions
in
your
report
you
say
amongst
other
things
that
what
we
offer
visitors
in
our
baths
is
a
permanent
supply
of
poison
stockmann
well
can
you
describe
it
any
other
way
peter
just
think
water
that
is
poisonous
whether
you
drink
it
or
bathe
in
it
and
this
we
offer
to
the
poor
sick
folk
who
come
to
us
trustfully
and
pay
us
at
an
exorbitant
rate
to
be
made
well
again
peter
stockmann
and
your
reasoning
leads
you
to
this
conclusion
that
we
must
build
a
sewer
to
draw
off
the
alleged
impurities
from
molledal
and
must
relay
the
water
conduits
stockmann
yes
do
you
see
any
other
way
out
of
it
i
do
peter
stockmann
i
made
a
pretext
this
morning
to
go
and
see
the
town
engineer
and
as
if
only
half
seriously
broached
the
subject
of
these
proposals
as
a
thing
we
might
perhaps
have
to
take
under
consideration
some
time
later
on
stockmann
some
time
later
on
peter
stockmann
he
smiled
at
what
he
considered
to
be
my
extravagance
naturally
have
you
taken
the
trouble
to
consider
what
your
proposed
alterations
would
cost
according
to
the
information
i
obtained
the
expenses
would
probably
mount
up
to
fifteen
or
twenty
thousand
pounds
stockmann
would
it
cost
so
much
peter
stockmann
yes
and
the
worst
part
of
it
would
be
that
the
work
would
take
at
least
two
years
stockmann
two
years
two
whole
years
peter
stockmann
at
least
and
what
are
we
to
do
with
the
baths
in
the
meantime
close
them
indeed
we
should
be
obliged
to
and
do
you
suppose
anyone
would
come
near
the
place
after
it
had
got
out
that
the
water
was
dangerous
stockmann
yes
but
peter
that
is
what
it
is
peter
stockmann
and
all
this
at
this
juncture
just
as
the
baths
are
beginning
to
be
known
there
are
other
towns
in
the
neighbourhood
with
qualifications
to
attract
visitors
for
bathing
purposes
do
you
suppose
they
would
immediately
strain
every
nerve
to
divert
the
entire
stream
of
strangers
to
themselves
unquestionably
they
would
and
then
where
should
we
be
we
should
probably
have
to
abandon
the
whole
thing
which
has
cost
us
so
much
then
you
would
have
ruined
your
native
town
stockmann
i
should
have
ruined
peter
stockmann
it
is
simply
and
solely
through
the
baths
that
the
town
has
before
it
any
future
worth
mentioning
you
know
that
just
as
well
as
stockmann
but
what
do
you
think
ought
to
be
done
then
peter
stockmann
your
report
has
not
convinced
me
that
the
condition
of
the
water
at
the
baths
is
as
bad
as
you
represent
it
to
be
stockmann
i
tell
you
it
is
even
worse
or
at
all
events
it
will
be
in
summer
when
the
warm
weather
comes
peter
stockmann
as
i
said
i
believe
you
exaggerate
the
matter
considerably
a
capable
physician
ought
to
know
what
measures
to
take
he
ought
to
be
capable
of
preventing
injurious
influences
or
of
remedying
them
if
they
become
obviously
persistent
stockmann
well
what
more
peter
stockmann
the
water
supply
for
the
baths
is
now
an
established
fact
and
in
consequence
must
be
treated
as
such
but
probably
the
committee
at
its
discretion
will
not
be
disinclined
to
consider
the
question
of
how
far
it
might
be
possible
to
introduce
certain
improvements
consistently
with
a
reasonable
expenditure
stockmann
and
do
you
suppose
that
i
will
have
anything
to
do
with
such
a
piece
of
trickery
as
that
peter
stockmann
trickery
stockmann
yes
it
would
be
a
trick
a
fraud
a
lie
a
downright
crime
towards
the
public
towards
the
whole
community
peter
stockmann
i
have
not
as
i
remarked
before
been
able
to
convince
myself
that
there
is
actually
any
imminent
danger
stockmann
you
have
it
is
impossible
that
you
should
not
be
convinced
i
know
i
have
represented
the
facts
absolutely
truthfully
and
fairly
and
you
know
it
very
well
peter
only
you
acknowledge
it
it
was
owing
to
your
action
that
both
the
baths
and
the
water
conduits
were
built
where
they
are
and
that
is
what
you
acknowledge
that
damnable
blunder
of
yours
pooh
do
you
suppose
i
do
see
through
you
peter
stockmann
and
even
if
that
were
true
if
i
perhaps
guard
my
reputation
somewhat
anxiously
it
is
in
the
interests
of
the
town
without
moral
authority
i
am
powerless
to
direct
public
affairs
as
seems
to
my
judgment
to
be
best
for
the
common
good
and
on
that
account
and
for
various
other
reasons
too
it
appears
to
me
to
be
a
matter
of
importance
that
your
report
should
not
be
delivered
to
the
committee
in
the
interests
of
the
public
you
must
withhold
it
then
later
on
i
will
raise
the
question
and
we
will
do
our
best
privately
but
nothing
of
this
unfortunate
affair
not
a
single
word
of
it
must
come
to
the
ears
of
the
public
stockmann
i
am
afraid
you
will
not
be
able
to
prevent
that
now
my
dear
peter
peter
stockmann
it
must
and
shall
be
prevented
stockmann
it
is
no
use
i
tell
you
there
are
too
many
people
that
know
about
it
peter
stockmann
that
know
about
it
who
surely
you
do
mean
those
fellows
on
the
people
messenger
stockmann
yes
they
know
the
independent
press
is
going
to
see
that
you
do
your
duty
peter
stockmann
after
a
short
pause
you
are
an
extraordinarily
independent
man
thomas
have
you
given
no
thought
to
the
consequences
this
may
have
for
yourself
stockmann
consequences
for
me
peter
stockmann
for
you
and
yours
yes
stockmann
what
the
deuce
do
you
mean
peter
stockmann
i
believe
i
have
always
behaved
in
a
brotherly
way
to
you
have
i
always
been
ready
to
oblige
or
to
help
you
stockmann
yes
you
have
and
i
am
grateful
to
you
for
it
peter
stockmann
there
is
no
need
indeed
to
some
extent
i
was
forced
to
do
so
for
my
own
sake
i
always
hoped
that
if
i
helped
to
improve
your
financial
position
i
should
be
able
to
keep
some
check
on
you
stockmann
what
then
it
was
only
for
your
own
sake
peter
stockmann
up
to
a
certain
point
yes
it
is
painful
for
a
man
in
an
official
position
to
have
his
nearest
relative
compromising
himself
time
after
time
stockmann
and
do
you
consider
that
i
do
that
peter
stockmann
yes
unfortunately
you
do
without
even
being
aware
of
it
you
have
a
restless
pugnacious
rebellious
disposition
and
then
there
is
that
disastrous
propensity
of
yours
to
want
to
write
about
every
sort
of
possible
and
impossible
thing
the
moment
an
idea
comes
into
your
head
you
must
needs
go
and
write
a
newspaper
article
or
a
whole
pamphlet
about
it
stockmann
well
but
is
it
not
the
duty
of
a
citizen
to
let
the
public
share
in
any
new
ideas
he
may
have
peter
stockmann
oh
the
public
does
require
any
new
ideas
the
public
is
best
served
by
the
good
old
established
ideas
it
already
has
stockmann
and
that
is
your
honest
opinion
peter
stockmann
yes
and
for
once
i
must
talk
frankly
to
you
hitherto
i
have
tried
to
avoid
doing
so
because
i
know
how
irritable
you
are
but
now
i
must
tell
you
the
truth
thomas
you
have
no
conception
what
an
amount
of
harm
you
do
yourself
by
your
impetuosity
you
complain
of
the
authorities
you
even
complain
of
the
government
you
are
always
pulling
them
to
pieces
you
insist
that
you
have
been
neglected
and
persecuted
but
what
else
can
such
a
cantankerous
man
as
you
expect
stockmann
what
next
cantankerous
am
i
peter
stockmann
yes
thomas
you
are
an
extremely
cantankerous
man
to
work
with
i
know
that
to
my
cost
you
disregard
everything
that
you
ought
to
have
consideration
for
you
seem
completely
to
forget
that
it
is
me
you
have
to
thank
for
your
appointment
here
as
medical
officer
to
the
baths
stockmann
i
was
entitled
to
it
as
a
matter
of
course
i
and
nobody
else
i
was
the
first
person
to
see
that
the
town
could
be
made
into
a
flourishing
and
i
was
the
only
one
who
saw
it
at
that
time
i
had
to
fight
in
support
of
the
idea
for
many
years
and
i
wrote
and
wrote
peter
stockmann
undoubtedly
but
things
were
not
ripe
for
the
scheme
then
though
of
course
you
could
not
judge
of
that
in
your
corner
up
north
but
as
soon
as
the
opportune
moment
came
i
and
the
others
took
the
matter
into
our
hands
stockmann
yes
and
made
this
mess
of
all
my
beautiful
plan
it
is
pretty
obvious
now
what
clever
fellows
you
were
peter
stockmann
to
my
mind
the
whole
thing
only
seems
to
mean
that
you
are
seeking
another
outlet
for
your
combativeness
you
want
to
pick
a
quarrel
with
your
superiors
an
old
habit
of
yours
you
can
not
put
up
with
any
authority
over
you
you
look
askance
at
anyone
who
occupies
a
superior
official
position
you
regard
him
as
a
personal
enemy
and
then
any
stick
is
good
enough
to
beat
him
with
but
now
i
have
called
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
town
interests
are
at
stake
and
incidentally
my
own
too
and
therefore
i
must
tell
you
thomas
that
you
will
find
me
inexorable
with
regard
to
what
i
am
about
to
require
you
to
do
stockmann
and
what
is
that
peter
stockmann
as
you
have
been
so
indiscreet
as
to
speak
of
this
delicate
matter
to
outsiders
despite
the
fact
that
you
ought
to
have
treated
it
as
entirely
official
and
confidential
it
is
obviously
impossible
to
hush
it
up
now
all
sorts
of
rumours
will
get
about
directly
and
everybody
who
has
a
grudge
against
us
will
take
care
to
embellish
these
rumours
so
it
will
be
necessary
for
you
to
refute
them
publicly
stockmann
i
how
i
do
understand
peter
stockmann
what
we
shall
expect
is
that
after
making
further
investigations
you
will
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
matter
is
not
by
any
means
as
dangerous
or
as
critical
as
you
imagined
in
the
first
instance
stockmann
oho
so
that
is
what
you
expect
peter
stockmann
and
what
is
more
we
shall
expect
you
to
make
public
profession
of
your
confidence
in
the
committee
and
in
their
readiness
to
consider
fully
and
conscientiously
what
steps
may
be
necessary
to
remedy
any
possible
defects
stockmann
but
you
will
never
be
able
to
do
that
by
patching
and
tinkering
at
it
never
take
my
word
for
it
peter
i
mean
what
i
say
as
deliberately
and
emphatically
as
possible
peter
stockmann
as
an
officer
under
the
committee
you
have
no
right
to
any
individual
opinion
stockmann
amazed
no
right
peter
stockmann
in
your
official
capacity
no
as
a
private
person
it
is
quite
another
matter
but
as
a
subordinate
member
of
the
staff
of
the
baths
you
have
no
right
to
express
any
opinion
which
runs
contrary
to
that
of
your
superiors
stockmann
this
is
too
much
i
a
doctor
a
man
of
science
have
no
right
to
peter
stockmann
the
matter
in
hand
is
not
simply
a
scientific
one
it
is
a
complicated
matter
and
has
its
economic
as
well
as
its
technical
side
stockmann
i
do
care
what
it
is
i
intend
to
be
free
to
express
my
opinion
on
any
subject
under
the
sun
peter
stockmann
as
you
please
but
not
on
any
subject
concerning
the
baths
that
we
forbid
stockmann
shouting
you
forbid
you
a
pack
of
peter
stockmann
i
forbid
it
i
your
chief
and
if
i
forbid
it
you
have
to
obey
stockmann
controlling
himself
peter
if
you
were
not
my
brother
petra
throwing
open
the
door
father
you
sha
stand
this
stockmann
coming
in
after
her
petra
petra
peter
stockmann
oh
so
you
have
been
eavesdropping
stockmann
you
were
talking
so
loud
we
could
help
it
petra
yes
i
was
listening
peter
stockmann
well
after
all
i
am
very
glad
stockmann
going
up
to
him
you
were
saying
something
about
forbidding
and
obeying
peter
stockmann
you
obliged
me
to
take
that
tone
with
you
stockmann
and
so
i
am
to
give
myself
the
lie
publicly
peter
stockmann
we
consider
it
absolutely
necessary
that
you
should
make
some
such
public
statement
as
i
have
asked
for
stockmann
and
if
i
do
not
obey
peter
stockmann
then
we
shall
publish
a
statement
ourselves
to
reassure
the
public
stockmann
very
well
but
in
that
case
i
shall
use
my
pen
against
you
i
stick
to
what
i
have
said
i
will
show
that
i
am
right
and
that
you
are
wrong
and
what
will
you
do
then
peter
stockmann
then
i
shall
not
be
able
to
prevent
your
being
dismissed
stockmann
what
petra
father
dismissed
stockmann
dismissed
peter
stockmann
dismissed
from
the
staff
of
the
baths
i
shall
be
obliged
to
propose
that
you
shall
immediately
be
given
notice
and
shall
not
be
allowed
any
further
participation
in
the
baths
affairs
stockmann
you
would
dare
to
do
that
peter
stockmann
it
is
you
that
are
playing
the
daring
game
petra
uncle
that
is
a
shameful
way
to
treat
a
man
like
father
stockmann
do
hold
your
tongue
petra
peter
stockmann
looking
at
petra
oh
so
we
volunteer
our
opinions
already
do
we
of
course
to
mrs
stockmann
katherine
i
imagine
you
are
the
most
sensible
person
in
this
house
use
any
influence
you
may
have
over
your
husband
and
make
him
see
what
this
will
entail
for
his
family
as
well
as
stockmann
my
family
is
my
own
concern
and
nobody
else
peter
stockmann
for
his
own
family
as
i
was
saying
as
well
as
for
the
town
he
lives
in
stockmann
it
is
i
who
have
the
real
good
of
the
town
at
heart
i
want
to
lay
bare
the
defects
that
sooner
or
later
must
come
to
the
light
of
day
i
will
show
whether
i
love
my
native
town
peter
stockmann
you
who
in
your
blind
obstinacy
want
to
cut
off
the
most
important
source
of
the
town
welfare
stockmann
the
source
is
poisoned
man
are
you
mad
we
are
making
our
living
by
retailing
filth
and
corruption
the
whole
of
our
flourishing
municipal
life
derives
its
sustenance
from
a
lie
peter
stockmann
all
imagination
or
something
even
worse
the
man
who
can
throw
out
such
offensive
insinuations
about
his
native
town
must
be
an
enemy
to
our
community
stockmann
going
up
to
him
do
you
dare
to
stockmann
throwing
herself
between
them
thomas
petra
catching
her
father
by
the
arm
do
lose
your
temper
father
peter
stockmann
i
will
not
expose
myself
to
violence
now
you
have
had
a
warning
so
reflect
on
what
you
owe
to
yourself
and
your
family
goodbye
goes
out
stockmann
walking
up
and
down
am
i
to
put
up
with
such
treatment
as
this
in
my
own
house
katherine
what
do
you
think
of
that
stockmann
indeed
it
is
both
shameful
and
absurd
thomas
petra
if
only
i
could
give
uncle
a
piece
of
my
mind
stockmann
it
is
my
own
fault
i
ought
to
have
flown
out
at
him
long
ago
shown
my
teeth
bitten
to
hear
him
call
me
an
enemy
to
our
community
me
i
shall
not
take
that
lying
down
upon
my
soul
stockmann
but
dear
thomas
your
brother
has
power
on
his
side
stockmann
yes
but
i
have
right
on
mine
i
tell
you
stockmann
oh
yes
right
right
what
is
the
use
of
having
right
on
your
side
if
you
have
not
got
might
petra
oh
mother
how
can
you
say
such
a
thing
stockmann
do
you
imagine
that
in
a
free
country
it
is
no
use
having
right
on
your
side
you
are
absurd
katherine
besides
i
got
the
independent
press
to
lead
the
way
and
the
compact
majority
behind
me
that
is
might
enough
i
should
think
stockmann
but
good
heavens
thomas
you
do
mean
to
stockmann
do
mean
to
what
stockmann
to
set
yourself
up
in
opposition
to
your
brother
stockmann
in
god
name
what
else
do
you
suppose
i
should
do
but
take
my
stand
on
right
and
truth
petra
yes
i
was
just
going
to
say
that
stockmann
but
it
wo
do
you
any
earthly
good
if
they
wo
do
it
they
wo
stockmann
oho
katherine
just
give
me
time
and
you
will
see
how
i
will
carry
the
war
into
their
camp
stockmann
yes
you
carry
the
war
into
their
camp
and
you
get
your
dismissal
that
is
what
you
will
do
stockmann
in
any
case
i
shall
have
done
my
duty
towards
the
public
towards
the
community
i
who
am
called
its
enemy
stockmann
but
towards
your
family
thomas
towards
your
own
home
do
you
think
that
is
doing
your
duty
towards
those
you
have
to
provide
for
petra
ah
do
think
always
first
of
us
mother
stockmann
oh
it
is
easy
for
you
to
talk
you
are
able
to
shift
for
yourself
if
need
be
but
remember
the
boys
thomas
and
think
a
little
of
yourself
too
and
of
me
stockmann
i
think
you
are
out
of
your
senses
katherine
if
i
were
to
be
such
a
miserable
coward
as
to
go
on
my
knees
to
peter
and
his
damned
crew
do
you
suppose
i
should
ever
know
an
hour
peace
of
mind
all
my
life
afterwards
stockmann
i
do
know
anything
about
that
but
god
preserve
us
from
the
peace
of
mind
we
shall
have
all
the
same
if
you
go
on
defying
him
you
will
find
yourself
again
without
the
means
of
subsistence
with
no
income
to
count
upon
i
should
think
we
had
had
enough
of
that
in
the
old
days
remember
that
thomas
think
what
that
means
stockmann
collecting
himself
with
a
struggle
and
clenching
his
fists
and
this
is
what
this
slavery
can
bring
upon
a
free
honourable
man
is
it
horrible
katherine
stockmann
yes
it
is
sinful
to
treat
you
so
it
is
perfectly
true
but
good
heavens
one
has
to
put
up
with
so
much
injustice
in
this
world
there
are
the
boys
thomas
look
at
them
what
is
to
become
of
them
oh
no
no
you
can
never
have
the
heart
ejlif
and
morten
have
come
in
while
she
was
speaking
with
their
school
books
in
their
hands
stockmann
the
boys
i
recovers
himself
suddenly
no
even
if
the
whole
world
goes
to
pieces
i
will
never
bow
my
neck
to
this
yokel
goes
towards
his
room
stockmann
following
him
thomas
what
are
you
going
to
do
stockmann
at
his
door
i
mean
to
have
the
right
to
look
my
sons
in
the
face
when
they
are
grown
men
goes

into

comes
in
from

with
stockmann
manuscript
in

well
i
must
say
hovstad
still
writing
have
you
read
it
through
billing
laying
the
on
the
desk
yes
indeed
i
have
hovstad
do
you
think
the
doctor
hits
them
pretty
hard
billing
hard
bless
my
soul
he
crushing
every
word
falls
like
how
shall
i
put
it
like
the
blow
of
a
sledgehammer
hovstad
yes
but
they
are
not
the
people
to
throw
up
the
sponge
at
the
first
blow
billing
that
is
true
and
for
that
reason
we
must
strike
blow
upon
blow
until
the
whole
of
this
aristocracy
tumbles
to
pieces
as
i
sat
in
there
reading
this
i
almost
seemed
to
see
a
revolution
in
being
hovstad
turning
round
hush
speak
so
that
aslaksen
can
not
hear
you
billing
lowering
his
voice
aslaksen
is
a
chap
a
coward
there
is
nothing
of
the
man
in
him
but
this
time
you
will
insist
on
your
own
way
wo
you
you
will
put
the
doctor
article
in
hovstad
yes
and
if
the
mayor
does
like
it
billing
that
will
be
the
devil
of
a
nuisance
hovstad
well
fortunately
we
can
turn
the
situation
to
good
account
whatever
happens
if
the
mayor
will
not
fall
in
with
the
project
he
will
have
all
the
small
tradesmen
down
on
him
the
whole
of
the
householders
association
and
the
rest
of
them
and
if
he
does
fall
in
with
it
he
will
fall
out
with
the
whole
crowd
of
large
shareholders
in
the
baths
who
up
to
now
have
been
his
most
valuable
supporters
billing
yes
because
they
will
certainly
have
to
fork
out
a
pretty
penny
hovstad
yes
you
may
be
sure
they
will
and
in
this
way
the
ring
will
be
broken
up
you
see
and
then
in
every
issue
of
the
paper
we
will
enlighten
the
public
on
the
mayor
incapability
on
one
point
and
another
and
make
it
clear
that
all
the
positions
of
trust
in
the
town
the
whole
control
of
municipal
affairs
ought
to
be
put
in
the
hands
of
the
liberals
billing
that
is
perfectly
true
i
see
it
coming
i
see
it
coming
we
are
on
the
threshold
of
a
revolution
a
knock
is
heard
at
the
door
hovstad
hush
calls
out
come
in
stockmann
comes
in
by
the
street
door
hovstad
goes
to
meet
him
ah
it
is
you
doctor
well
stockmann
you
may
set
to
work
and
print
it
hovstad
hovstad
has
it
come
to
that
then
billing
hurrah
stockmann
yes
print
away
undoubtedly
it
has
come
to
that
now
they
must
take
what
they
get
there
is
going
to
be
a
fight
in
the
town
mr
billing
billing
war
to
the
knife
i
hope
we
will
get
our
knives
to
their
throats
doctor
stockmann
this
article
is
only
a
beginning
i
have
already
got
four
or
five
more
sketched
out
in
my
head
where
is
aslaksen
billing
calls
into
the
aslaksen
just
come
here
for
a
minute
hovstad
four
or
five
more
articles
did
you
say
on
the
same
subject
stockmann
no
far
from
it
my
dear
fellow
no
they
are
about
quite
another
matter
but
they
all
spring
from
the
question
of
the
water
supply
and
the
drainage
one
thing
leads
to
another
you
know
it
is
like
beginning
to
pull
down
an
old
house
exactly
billing
upon
my
soul
it
true
you
find
you
are
not
done
till
you
have
pulled
all
the
old
rubbish
down
aslaksen
coming
in
pulled
down
you
are
not
thinking
of
pulling
down
the
baths
surely
doctor
hovstad
far
from
it
do
be
afraid
stockmann
no
we
meant
something
quite
different
well
what
do
you
think
of
my
article
hovstad
hovstad
i
think
it
is
simply
a
masterpiece
stockmann
do
you
really
think
so
well
i
am
very
pleased
very
pleased
hovstad
it
is
so
clear
and
intelligible
one
need
have
no
special
knowledge
to
understand
the
bearing
of
it
you
will
have
every
enlightened
man
on
your
side
aslaksen
and
every
prudent
man
too
i
hope
billing
the
prudent
and
the
imprudent
almost
the
whole
town
aslaksen
in
that
case
we
may
venture
to
print
it
stockmann
i
should
think
so
hovstad
we
will
put
it
in
tomorrow
morning
stockmann
of
course
you
must
not
lose
a
single
day
what
i
wanted
to
ask
you
aslaksen
was
if
you
would
supervise
the
printing
of
it
yourself
aslaksen
with
pleasure
stockmann
take
care
of
it
as
if
it
were
a
treasure
no
misprints
every
word
is
important
i
will
look
in
again
a
little
later
perhaps
you
will
be
able
to
let
me
see
a
proof
i
ca
tell
you
how
eager
i
am
to
see
it
in
print
and
see
it
burst
upon
the
public
billing
burst
upon
them
yes
like
a
flash
of
lightning
stockmann
and
to
have
it
submitted
to
the
judgment
of
my
intelligent
fellow
townsmen
you
can
not
imagine
what
i
have
gone
through
today
i
have
been
threatened
first
with
one
thing
and
then
with
another
they
have
tried
to
rob
me
of
my
most
elementary
rights
as
a
man
billing
what
your
rights
as
a
man
stockmann
they
have
tried
to
degrade
me
to
make
a
coward
of
me
to
force
me
to
put
personal
interests
before
my
most
sacred
convictions
billing
that
is
too
much
i
damned
if
it
is
hovstad
oh
you
must
be
surprised
at
anything
from
that
quarter
stockmann
well
they
will
get
the
worst
of
it
with
me
they
may
assure
themselves
of
that
i
shall
consider
the
people
messenger
my
now
and
every
single
day
i
will
bombard
them
with
one
article
after
another
like
bombshells
aslaksen
yes
but
billing
hurrah
it
is
war
it
is
war
stockmann
i
shall
smite
them
to
the
ground
i
shall
crush
them
i
shall
break
down
all
their
defenses
before
the
eyes
of
the
honest
public
that
is
what
i
shall
do
aslaksen
yes
but
in
moderation
doctor
proceed
with
moderation
billing
not
a
bit
of
it
not
a
bit
of
it
do
spare
the
dynamite
stockmann
because
it
is
not
merely
a
question
of
and
drains
now
you
know
no
it
is
the
whole
of
our
social
life
that
we
have
got
to
purify
and
disinfect
billing
spoken
like
a
deliverer
stockmann
all
the
incapables
must
be
turned
out
you
understand
and
that
in
every
walk
of
life
endless
vistas
have
opened
themselves
to
my
mind
eye
today
i
can
not
see
it
all
quite
clearly
yet
but
i
shall
in
time
young
and
vigorous
those
are
what
we
need
and
must
seek
my
friends
we
must
have
new
men
in
command
at
all
our
outposts
billing
hear
hear
stockmann
we
only
need
to
stand
by
one
another
and
it
will
all
be
perfectly
easy
the
revolution
will
be
launched
like
a
ship
that
runs
smoothly
off
the
stocks
do
you
think
so
hovstad
for
my
part
i
think
we
have
now
a
prospect
of
getting
the
municipal
authority
into
the
hands
where
it
should
lie
aslaksen
and
if
only
we
proceed
with
moderation
i
can
not
imagine
that
there
will
be
any
risk
stockmann
who
the
devil
cares
whether
there
is
any
risk
or
not
what
i
am
doing
i
am
doing
in
the
name
of
truth
and
for
the
sake
of
my
conscience
hovstad
you
are
a
man
who
deserves
to
be
supported
doctor
aslaksen
yes
there
is
no
denying
that
the
doctor
is
a
true
friend
to
the
town
a
real
friend
to
the
community
that
he
is
billing
take
my
word
for
it
aslaksen
stockmann
is
a
friend
of
the
people
aslaksen
i
fancy
the
householders
association
will
make
use
of
that
expression
before
long
stockmann
affected
grasps
their
hands
thank
you
thank
you
my
dear
staunch
friends
it
is
very
refreshing
to
me
to
hear
you
say
that
my
brother
called
me
something
quite
different
by
jove
he
shall
have
it
back
with
interest
but
now
i
must
be
off
to
see
a
poor
devil
i
will
come
back
as
i
said
keep
a
very
careful
eye
on
the
manuscript
aslaksen
and
do
for
worlds
leave
out
any
of
my
notes
of
exclamation
rather
put
one
or
two
more
in
capital
capital
well
for
the
present
goodbye
goodbye
they
show
him
to
the
door
and
bow
him
out
hovstad
he
may
prove
an
invaluably
useful
man
to
us
aslaksen
yes
so
long
as
he
confines
himself
to
this
matter
of
the
baths
but
if
he
goes
farther
afield
i
do
think
it
would
be
advisable
to
follow
him
hovstad
hm
that
all
depends
billing
you
are
so
infernally
timid
aslaksen
aslaksen
timid
yes
when
it
is
a
question
of
the
local
authorities
i
am
timid
mr
billing
it
is
a
lesson
i
have
learned
in
the
school
of
experience
let
me
tell
you
but
try
me
in
higher
politics
in
matters
that
concern
the
government
itself
and
then
see
if
i
am
timid
billing
no
you
are
i
admit
but
this
is
simply
contradicting
yourself
aslaksen
i
am
a
man
with
a
conscience
and
that
is
the
whole
matter
if
you
attack
the
government
you
do
do
the
community
any
harm
anyway
those
fellows
pay
no
attention
to
attacks
you
see
they
go
on
just
as
they
are
in
spite
of
them
but
local
authorities
are
different
they
can
be
turned
out
and
then
perhaps
you
may
get
an
ignorant
lot
into
office
who
may
do
irreparable
harm
to
the
householders
and
everybody
else
hovstad
but
what
of
the
education
of
citizens
by
self
government
do
you
attach
any
importance
to
that
aslaksen
when
a
man
has
interests
of
his
own
to
protect
he
can
not
think
of
everything
hovstad
hovstad
then
i
hope
i
shall
never
have
interests
of
my
own
to
protect
billing
hear
hear
aslaksen
with
a
smile
hm
points
to
the
desk
sheriff
stensgaard
was
your
predecessor
at
that
editorial
desk
billing
spitting
bah
that
turncoat
hovstad
i
am
not
a
weathercock
and
never
will
be
aslaksen
a
politician
should
never
be
too
certain
of
anything
hovstad
and
as
for
you
mr
billing
i
should
think
it
is
time
for
you
to
be
taking
in
a
reef
or
two
in
your
sails
seeing
that
you
are
applying
for
the
post
of
secretary
to
the
bench
billing
i
hovstad
are
you
billing
billing
well
yes
but
you
must
clearly
understand
i
am
only
doing
it
to
annoy
the
bigwigs
aslaksen
anyhow
it
is
no
business
of
mine
but
if
i
am
to
be
accused
of
timidity
and
of
inconsistency
in
my
principles
this
is
what
i
want
to
point
out
my
political
past
is
an
open
book
i
have
never
changed
except
perhaps
to
become
a
little
more
moderate
you
see
my
heart
is
still
with
the
people
but
i
do
deny
that
my
reason
has
a
certain
bias
towards
the
authorities
the
local
ones
i
mean
goes
into
the
printing
room
billing
ought
we
to
try
and
get
rid
of
him
hovstad
hovstad
do
you
know
anyone
else
who
will
advance
the
money
for
our
paper
and
printing
bill
billing
it
is
an
infernal
nuisance
that
we
do
possess
some
capital
to
trade
on
hovstad
sitting
down
at
his
desk
yes
if
we
only
had
that
then
billing
suppose
you
were
to
apply
to
stockmann
hovstad
turning
over
some
papers
what
is
the
use
he
has
got
nothing
billing
no
but
he
has
got
a
warm
man
in
the
background
old
morten
kiil
the
badger
as
they
call
him
hovstad
writing
are
you
so
sure
he
has
got
anything
billing
good
lord
of
course
he
has
and
some
of
it
must
come
to
the
stockmanns
most
probably
he
will
do
something
for
the
children
at
all
events
hovstad
turning
half
round
are
you
counting
on
that
billing
counting
on
it
of
course
i
am
not
counting
on
anything
hovstad
that
is
right
and
i
should
not
count
on
the
secretaryship
to
the
bench
either
if
i
were
you
for
i
can
assure
you
you
wo
get
it
billing
do
you
think
i
am
not
quite
aware
of
that
my
object
is
precisely
not
to
get
it
a
slight
of
that
kind
stimulates
a
fighting
power
it
is
like
getting
a
supply
of
fresh
bile
and
i
am
sure
one
needs
that
badly
enough
in
a
place
like
this
where
it
is
so
seldom
anything
happens
to
stir
one
up
hovstad
writing
quite
so
quite
so
billing
ah
i
shall
be
heard
of
yet
now
i
shall
go
and
write
the
appeal
to
the
householders
association
goes
into
the
room
on
the
right
hovstad
sitting
al
his
desk
biting
his
penholder
says
slowly
hm
that
it
is
it
a
knock
is
heard
come
in
petra
comes
in
by
the
outer
door
hovstad
gets
up
what
you
here
petra
yes
you
must
forgive
me
hovstad
pulling
a
chair
forward
wo
you
sit
down
petra
no
thank
you
i
must
go
again
in
a
moment
hovstad
have
you
come
with
a
message
from
your
father
by
any
chance
petra
no
i
have
come
on
my
own
account
takes
a
book
out
of
her
coat
pocket
here
is
the
english
story
hovstad
why
have
you
brought
it
back
petra
because
i
am
not
going
to
translate
it
hovstad
but
you
promised
me
faithfully
petra
yes
but
then
i
had
not
read
it
i
do
suppose
you
have
read
it
either
hovstad
no
you
know
quite
well
i
do
understand
english
but
petra
quite
so
that
is
why
i
wanted
to
tell
you
that
you
must
find
something
else
lays
the
book
on
the
table
you
ca
use
this
for
the
people
messenger
hovstad
why
not
petra
because
it
conflicts
with
all
your
opinions
hovstad
oh
for
that
matter
petra
you
do
understand
me
the
burden
of
this
story
is
that
there
is
a
supernatural
power
that
looks
after
the
good
people
in
this
world
and
makes
everything
happen
for
the
best
in
their
case
while
all
the
bad
people
are
punished
hovstad
well
but
that
is
all
right
that
is
just
what
our
readers
want
petra
and
are
you
going
to
be
the
one
to
give
it
to
them
for
myself
i
do
not
believe
a
word
of
it
you
know
quite
well
that
things
do
not
happen
so
in
reality
hovstad
you
are
perfectly
right
but
an
editor
can
not
always
act
as
he
would
prefer
he
is
often
obliged
to
bow
to
the
wishes
of
the
public
in
unimportant
matters
politics
are
the
most
important
thing
in
life
for
a
newspaper
anyway
and
if
i
want
to
carry
my
public
with
me
on
the
path
that
leads
to
liberty
and
progress
i
must
not
frighten
them
away
if
they
find
a
moral
tale
of
this
sort
in
the
serial
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
they
will
be
all
the
more
ready
to
read
what
is
printed
above
it
they
feel
more
secure
as
it
were
petra
for
shame
you
would
never
go
and
set
a
snare
like
that
for
your
readers
you
are
not
a
spider
hovstad
smiling
thank
you
for
having
such
a
good
opinion
of
me
no
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
is
billing
idea
and
not
mine
petra
billing
hovstad
yes
anyway
he
propounded
that
theory
here
one
day
and
it
is
billing
who
is
so
anxious
to
have
that
story
in
the
paper
i
do
know
anything
about
the
book
petra
but
how
can
billing
with
his
emancipated
views
hovstad
oh
billing
is
a
man
he
is
applying
for
the
post
of
secretary
to
the
bench
too
i
hear
petra
i
do
believe
it
hovstad
how
could
he
possibly
bring
himself
to
do
such
a
thing
hovstad
ah
you
must
ask
him
that
petra
i
should
never
have
thought
it
of
him
hovstad
looking
more
closely
at
her
no
does
it
really
surprise
you
so
much
petra
yes
or
perhaps
not
altogether
really
i
do
quite
know
hovstad
we
journalists
are
not
much
worth
miss
stockmann
petra
do
you
really
mean
that
hovstad
i
think
so
sometimes
petra
yes
in
the
ordinary
affairs
of
everyday
life
perhaps
i
can
understand
that
but
now
when
you
have
taken
a
weighty
matter
in
hand
hovstad
this
matter
of
your
father
you
mean
petra
exactly
it
seems
to
me
that
now
you
must
feel
you
are
a
man
worth
more
than
most
hovstad
yes
today
i
do
feel
something
of
that
sort
petra
of
course
you
do
do
you
it
is
a
splendid
vocation
you
have
chosen
to
smooth
the
way
for
the
march
of
unappreciated
truths
and
new
and
courageous
lines
of
thought
if
it
were
nothing
more
than
because
you
stand
fearlessly
in
the
open
and
take
up
the
cause
of
an
injured
man
hovstad
especially
when
that
injured
man
is
ahem
i
do
rightly
know
how
to
petra
when
that
man
is
so
upright
and
so
honest
you
mean
hovstad
more
gently
especially
when
he
is
your
father
i
meant
petra
suddenly
checked
that
hovstad
yes
petra
miss
petra
petra
is
it
that
that
is
first
and
foremost
with
you
not
the
matter
itself
not
the
truth
not
my
father
big
generous
heart
hovstad
certainly
of
course
that
too
petra
no
thank
you
you
have
betrayed
yourself
hovstad
and
now
i
shall
never
trust
you
again
in
anything
hovstad
can
you
really
take
it
so
amiss
in
me
that
it
is
mostly
for
your
sake
petra
what
i
am
angry
with
you
for
is
for
not
having
been
honest
with
my
father
you
talked
to
him
as
if
the
truth
and
the
good
of
the
community
were
what
lay
nearest
to
your
heart
you
have
made
fools
of
both
my
father
and
me
you
are
not
the
man
you
made
yourself
out
to
be
and
that
i
shall
never
forgive
hovstad
you
ought
not
to
speak
so
bitterly
miss
petra
least
of
all
now
petra
why
not
now
especially
hovstad
because
your
father
can
not
do
without
my
help
petra
looking
him
up
and
down
are
you
that
sort
of
man
too
for
shame
hovstad
no
no
i
am
not
this
came
upon
me
so
unexpectedly
you
must
believe
that
petra
i
know
what
to
believe
goodbye
aslaksen
coming
from
the
printing
room
hurriedly
and
with
an
air
of
mystery
damnation
hovstad
sees
petra
oh
this
is
awkward
petra
there
is
the
book
you
must
give
it
to
some
one
else

extremely
annoying
experience

the
various
business
you
have
to
attend
to
peter
stockmann
the
medical
officer
of
the
baths
is
responsible
for
what
happened
today

the
doctor
peter
stockmann
he
has
addressed
a
kind
of
report
to
the
baths
committee
on
the
subject
of
certain
supposed
defects
in
the
baths
hovstad
has
he
indeed
peter
stockmann
yes
has
he
not
told

thought
he
said
hovstad

did
mention
something
about
aslaksen
coming
from
the
i
ought
to
have
that
copy
hovstad
angrily
ahem
there
it
is
on
the
desk
aslaksen
taking
it
right

stockmann
but
look
there
that
is
the
thing
i
was
speaking
of
aslaksen
yes
that
is
the
doctor
article
mayor
hovstad
oh

that
what
you
were
speaking
about
peter
stockmann

is
it
what
do
you
think
of
it
hovstad
oh
i
am
only
a
layman
and
i
have
only
taken
a
very
cursory
glance
at
it
peter
stockmann
but
you
are
going
to
print
it
hovstad
i
can
not
very
well
refuse
a
distinguished
man
aslaksen

have
nothing
to
do
with
editing
the
paper

peter
stockmann
i
understand

merely

into
my
hands
peter
stockmann
quite
so

a
discreet
and
thoughtful
man

am
delighted

and
a
man
of
very
considerable
influence

chiefly
among
the
small
tradesmen
sir
peter
stockmann
the
small
are
the
majority
here
as
everywhere
else
aslaksen
that
is
true
peter
stockmann
and
i
have
no
doubt
you
know
the
general
trend
of
opinion
among
them
do
you
aslaksen
yes
i
think
i
may
say
i
do
mayor
peter
stockmann
yes
well
since
there
is
such
a
praiseworthy
spirit
of
among
the
less
wealthy
citizens
of
our
town
aslaksen
what
hovstad
peter
stockmann
it
is
pleasing
evidence
of
a
feeling
extremely
pleasing
evidence
i
might
almost
say
i
hardly
expected
it
but
you
have
a
closer
knowledge
of
public
opinion
than
aslaksen
but
mayor
peter
stockmann
and
indeed
it
is
no
small
sacrifice
that
the
town
is
going
to
make
hovstad
the
town
aslaksen
but
i
do
understand
is
it
the
baths
peter
stockmann
at
a
provisional
estimate
the
alterations
that
the
medical
officer
asserts
to
be
desirable
will
cost
somewhere
about
twenty
thousand
pounds
aslaksen
that
is
a
lot
of
money
but
peter
stockmann
of
course
it
will
be
necessary
to
raise
a
municipal
loan
hovstad
getting
up
surely
you
never
mean
that
the
town
must
pay
aslaksen
do
you
mean
that
it
must
come
out
of
the
municipal
funds
out
of
the
pockets
of
the
small
tradesmen
peter
stockmann
well
my
dear
aslaksen
where
else
is
the
money
to
come
from
aslaksen
the
gentlemen
who
own
the
baths
ought
to
provide
that
peter
stockmann
the
proprietors
of
the
baths
are
not
in
a
position
to
incur
any
further
expense
aslaksen
is
that
absolutely
certain
mayor
peter
stockmann
i
have
satisfied
myself
that
it
is
so
if
the
town
wants
these
very
extensive
alterations
it
will
have
to
pay
for
them
aslaksen
but
damn
it
all
i
beg
your
pardon
this
is
quite
another
matter
hovstad
hovstad
it
is
indeed
peter
stockmann
the
most
fatal
part
of
it
is
that
we
shall
be
obliged
to
shut
the
baths
for
a
couple
of
years
hovstad
shut
them
shut
them
altogether
aslaksen
for
two
years
peter
stockmann
yes
the
work
will
take
as
long
as
that
at
least
aslaksen
i
damned
if
we
will
stand
that
mayor
what
are
we
householders
to
live
upon
in
the
meantime
peter
stockmann
unfortunately
that
is
an
extremely
difficult
question
to
answer
aslaksen
but
what
would
you
have
us
do
do
you
suppose
we
shall
have
a
single
visitor
in
the
town
if
we
go
about
proclaiming
that
our
water
is
polluted
that
we
are
living
over
a
plague
spot
that
the
entire
town
aslaksen
and
the
whole
thing
is
merely
imagination
peter
stockmann
with
the
best
will
in
the
world
i
have
not
been
able
to
come
to
any
other
conclusion
aslaksen
well
then
i
must
say
it
is
absolutely
unjustifiable
of
stockmann
i
beg
your
pardon
mayor
peter
stockmann
what
you
say
is
lamentably
true
aslaksen
my
brother
has
unfortunately
always
been
a
headstrong
man
aslaksen
after
this
do
you
mean
to
give
him
your
support
hovstad
hovstad
can
you
suppose
for
a
moment
that
i
peter
stockmann
i
have
drawn
up
a
short
resume
of
the
situation
as
it
appears
from
a
reasonable
man
point
of
view
in
it
i
have
indicated
how
certain
possible
defects
might
suitably
be
remedied
without
outrunning
the
resources
of
the
baths
committee
hovstad
have
you
got
it
with
you
mayor
peter
stockmann
fumbling
in
his
pocket
yes
i
brought
it
with
me
in
case
you
should
aslaksen
good
lord
there
he
is
peter
stockmann
who
my
brother
hovstad
where
where
aslaksen
he
has
just
gone
through
the
printing
room
peter
stockmann
how
unlucky
i
do
want
to
meet
him
here
and
i
had
still
several
things
to
speak
to
you
about
hovstad
pointing
to
the
door
on
the
right
go
in
there
for
the
present
peter
stockmann
but
hovstad
you
will
only
find
billing
in
there
aslaksen
quick
quick
mayor
he
is
just
coming
peter
stockmann
yes
very
well
but
see
that
you
get
rid
of
him
quickly
goes
out
through
the
door
on
the
right
which
aslaksen
opens
for
him
and
shuts
after
him
hovstad
pretend
to
be
doing
something
aslaksen
sits
down
and
writes
aslaksen
begins
foraging
among
a
heap
of
newspapers
that
are
lying
on
a
chair
stockmann
coming
in
from
the
printing
room
here
i
am
again
puts
down
his
hat
and
stick
hovstad
writing
already
doctor
hurry
up
with
what
we
were
speaking
about
aslaksen
we
are
very
pressed
for
time
today
stockmann
to
aslaksen
no
proof
for
me
to
see
yet
i
hear
aslaksen
without
turning
round
you
could
expect
it
yet
doctor
stockmann
no
no
but
i
am
impatient
as
you
can
understand
i
shall
not
know
a
moment
peace
of
mind
until
i
see
it
in
print
hovstad
hm
it
will
take
a
good
while
yet
wo
it
aslaksen
aslaksen
yes
i
am
almost
afraid
it
will
stockmann
all
right
my
dear
friends
i
will
come
back
i
do
not
mind
coming
back
twice
if
necessary
a
matter
of
such
great
importance
the
welfare
of
the
town
at
stake
it
is
no
time
to
shirk
trouble
is
just
going
but
stops
and
comes
back
look
here
there
is
one
thing
more
i
want
to
speak
to
you
about
hovstad
excuse
me
but
could
it
not
wait
till
some
other
time
stockmann
i
can
tell
you
in
half
a
dozen
words
it
is
only
this
when
my
article
is
read
tomorrow
and
it
is
realised
that
i
have
been
quietly
working
the
whole
winter
for
the
welfare
of
the
town
hovstad
yes
but
doctor
stockmann
i
know
what
you
are
going
to
say
you
do
see
how
on
earth
it
was
any
more
than
my
duty
my
obvious
duty
as
a
citizen
of
course
it
was
i
know
that
as
well
as
you
but
my
fellow
citizens
you
know
good
lord
think
of
all
the
good
souls
who
think
so
highly
of
me
aslaksen
yes
our
townsfolk
have
had
a
very
high
opinion
of
you
so
far
doctor
stockmann
yes
and
that
is
just
why
i
am
afraid
they
well
this
is
the
point
when
this
reaches
them
especially
the
poorer
classes
and
sounds
in
their
ears
like
a
summons
to
take
the
town
affairs
into
their
own
hands
for
the
future
hovstad
getting
up
ahem
doctor
i
wo
conceal
from
you
the
fact
stockmann
ah
i
i
knew
there
was
something
in
the
wind
but
i
wo
hear
a
word
of
it
if
anything
of
that
sort
is
being
set
on
foot
hovstad
of
what
sort
stockmann
well
whatever
it
is
whether
it
is
a
demonstration
in
my
honour
or
a
banquet
or
a
subscription
list
for
some
presentation
to
me
whatever
it
is
you
most
promise
me
solemnly
and
faithfully
to
put
a
stop
to
it
you
too
aslaksen
do
you
understand
hovstad
you
must
forgive
me
doctor
but
sooner
or
later
we
must
tell
you
the
plain
truth
he
is
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
stockmann
who
comes
in
from
the
street
door
stockmann
seeing
her
husband
just
as
i
thought
hovstad
going
towards
her
you
too
stockmann
stockmann
what
on
earth
do
you
want
here
katherine
stockmann
i
should
think
you
know
very
well
what
i
want
hovstad
wo
you
sit
down
or
perhaps
stockmann
no
thank
you
do
trouble
and
you
must
not
be
offended
at
my
coming
to
fetch
my
husband
i
am
the
mother
of
three
children
you
know
stockmann
nonsense
we
know
all
about
that
stockmann
well
one
would
not
give
you
credit
for
much
thought
for
your
wife
and
children
today
if
you
had
had
that
you
would
not
have
gone
and
dragged
us
all
into
misfortune
stockmann
are
you
out
of
your
senses
katherine
because
a
man
has
a
wife
and
children
is
he
not
to
be
allowed
to
proclaim
the
he
not
to
be
allowed
to
be
an
actively
useful
citizen
is
he
not
to
be
allowed
to
do
a
service
to
his
native
town
stockmann
yes
thomas
in
reason
aslaksen
just
what
i
say
moderation
in
everything
stockmann
and
that
is
why
you
wrong
us
hovstad
in
enticing
my
husband
away
from
his
home
and
making
a
dupe
of
him
in
all
this
hovstad
i
certainly
am
making
a
dupe
of
no
one
stockmann
making
a
dupe
of
me
do
you
suppose
i
should
allow
myself
to
be
duped
stockmann
it
is
just
what
you
do
i
know
quite
well
you
have
more
brains
than
anyone
in
the
town
but
you
are
extremely
easily
duped
thomas
to
hovstad
please
do
realise
that
he
loses
his
post
at
the
baths
if
you
print
what
he
has
written

compact
majority
behind
me

any
such
horrid
thing
behind

home
and
look
after
your
house

confident

and
down

his
hands

the
people

win
the
fight

may
be
certain

whole
of

middle
class

victorious
army

deuce

the
master

the
whole
town

of
an
official
uniform

the
newly
awakened
lionhearted
people
are
going
to
be
frightened
by
an
official
hat

is
going
to
be
a
revolution
in
the
town
tomorrow
let
me
tell

shall
turn

have
triumphant
social
forces
behind
me
hovstad
and
billing
will
thunder
in
the
people
messenger
and
aslaksen
will
take
the
field
at
the
head
of
the
whole
householders
association
aslaksen
that
i
wo
doctor
stockmann
of
course
you
will
peter
stockmann
ah
may
i
ask
then
if
hovstad
intends
to
join
this
agitation
hovstad
no
mayor
aslaksen
no
hovstad
is
not
such
a
fool
as
to
go
and
ruin
his
paper
and
himself
for
the
sake
of
an
imaginary
grievance
stockmann
looking
round
him
what
does
this
mean
hovstad
you
have
represented
your
case
in
a
false
light
doctor
and
therefore
i
am
unable
to
give
you
my
support
billing
and
after
what
the
mayor
was
so
kind
as
to
tell
me
just
now
i
stockmann
a
false
light
leave
that
part
of
it
to
me
only
print
my
article
i
am
quite
capable
of
defending
it
hovstad
i
am
not
going
to
print
it
i
can
not
and
will
not
and
dare
not
print
it
stockmann
you
dare
not
what
nonsense
you
are
the
editor
and
an
editor
controls
his
paper
i
suppose
aslaksen
no
it
is
the
subscribers
doctor
peter
stockmann
fortunately
yes
aslaksen
it
is
public
opinion
the
enlightened
public
householders
and
people
of
that
kind
they
control
the
newspapers
stockmann
composedly
and
i
have
all
these
influences
against
me
aslaksen
yes
you
have
it
would
mean
the
absolute
ruin
of
the
community
if
your
article
were
to
appear
stockmann
indeed
peter
stockmann
my
hat
and
stick
if
you
please
stockmann
takes
off
the
hat
and
lays
it
on
the
table
with
the
stick
peter
stockmann
takes
them
up
your
authority
as
mayor
has
come
to
an
untimely
end
stockmann
we
have
not
got
to
the
end
yet
to
hovstad
then
it
is
quite
impossible
for
you
to
print
my
article
in
the
messenger
hovstad
quite
impossible
out
of
regard
for
your
family
as
well
stockmann
you
need
not
concern
yourself
about
his
family
thank
you
hovstad
peter
stockmann
taking
a
paper
from
his
pocket
it
will
be
sufficient
for
the
guidance
of
the
public
if
this
appears
it
is
an
official
statement
may
i
trouble
you
hovstad
taking
the
paper
certainly
i
will
see
that
it
is
printed
stockmann
but
not
mine
do
you
imagine
that
you
can
silence
me
and
stifle
the
truth
you
will
not
find
it
so
easy
as
you
suppose
aslaksen
kindly
take
my
manuscript
at
once
and
print
it
as
a
pamphlet
at
my
expense
i
will
have
four
hundred
copies
no
five
or
six
hundred
aslaksen
if
you
offered
me
its
weight
in
gold
i
could
not
lend
my
press
for
any
such
purpose
doctor
it
would
be
flying
in
the
face
of
public
opinion
you
will
not
get
it
printed
anywhere
in
the
town
stockmann
then
give
it
me
back
hovstad
giving
him
the
here
it
is
stockmann
taking
his
hat
and
stick
it
shall
be
made
public
all
the
same
i
will
read
it
out
at
a
mass
meeting
of
the
townspeople
all
my
shall
hear
the
voice
of
truth
peter
stockmann
you
will
not
find
any
public
body
in
the
town
that
will
give
you
the
use
of
their
hall
for
such
a
purpose
aslaksen
not
a
single
one
i
am
certain
billing
no
i
damned
if
you
will
find
one
stockmann
but
this
is
too
shameful
why
should
every
one
turn
against
you
like
that
stockmann
angrily
i
will
tell
you
why
it
is
because
all
the
men
in
this
town
are
old
women
like
you
they
all
think
of
nothing
but
their
families
and
never
of
the
community
stockmann
putting
her
arm
into
his
then
i
will
show
them
that
an
old
woman
can
be
a
man
for
once
i
am
going
to
stand
by
you
thomas
stockmann
bravely
said
katherine
it
shall
be
made
public
as
i
am
a
living
soul
if
i
ca
hire
a
hall
i
shall
hire
a
drum
and
parade
the
town
with
it
and
read
it
at
every
peter
stockmann
you
are
surely
not
such
an
errant
fool
as
that
stockmann
yes
i
am
aslaksen
you
wo
find
a
single
man
in
the
whole
town
to
go
with
you
billing
no
i
damned
if
you
will
stockmann
do
give
in
thomas
i
will
tell
the
boys
to
go
with
you
stockmann
that
is
a
splendid
idea
stockmann
morten
will
be
delighted
and
ejlif
will
do
whatever
he
does
stockmann
yes
and
petra
and
you
too
katherine
stockmann
no
i
wo
do
that
but
i
will
stand
at
the
window
and
watch
you
that
what
i
will
do
stockmann
puts
his
arms
round
her
and
kisses
her
thank
you
my
dear
now
you
and
i
are
going
to
try
a
fall
my
fine
gentlemen
i
am
going
to
see
whether
a
pack
of
cowards
can
succeed
in
gagging

here
tonight
citizen

is
going
to
deliver
an
address
attacking
the
mayor
citizen
but
the
mayor
is
his
brother
citizen
that
does
matter
stockmann
not
the
chap
to
be
afraid
peter
stockmann
for
various
reasons
which
you
will
easily
understand
i
must
beg
to
be
excused
but
fortunately
we
have
amongst
us
a
man
who
i
think
will
be
acceptable
to
you
all
i
refer
to
the
president
of
the
householders
association
aslaksen
several
voices
yes
aslaksen
bravo
aslaksen
stockmann
takes
up
his
and
walks
up
and
down
the
platform
aslaksen
since
my
choose
to
entrust
me
with
this
duty
i
can
not
refuse
loud
applause
aslaksen
mounts
the
platform
billing
writing
aslaksen
was
elected
with
enthusiasm
aslaksen
and
now
as
i
am
in
this
position
i
should
like
to
say
a
few
brief
words
i
am
a
quiet
and
peaceable
man
who
believes
in
discreet
moderation
and
and
in
moderate
discretion
all
my
friends
can
bear
witness
to
that
several
voices
that
right
that
right
aslaksen
aslaksen
i
have
learned
in
the
school
of
life
and
experience
that
moderation
is
the
most
valuable
virtue
a
citizen
can
possess
peter
stockmann
hear
hear
aslaksen
and
moreover
that
discretion
and
moderation
are
what
enable
a
man
to
be
of
most
service
to
the
community
i
would
therefore
suggest
to
our
esteemed
who
has
called
this
meeting
that
he
should
strive
to
keep
strictly
within
the
bounds
of
moderation
a
man
by
the
door
three
cheers
for
the
moderation
society
a
voice
shame
several
voices
sh
aslaksen
no
interruptions
gentlemen
please
does
anyone
wish
to
make
any
remarks
peter
stockmann
chairman
aslaksen
the
mayor
will
address
the
meeting
peter
stockmann
in
consideration
of
the
close
relationship
in
which
as
you
all
know
i
stand
to
the
present
medical
officer
of
the
baths
i
should
have
preferred
not
to
speak
this
evening
but
my
official
position
with
regard
to
the
baths
and
my
solicitude
for
the
vital
interests
of
the
town
compel
me
to
bring
forward
a
motion
i
venture
to
presume
that
there
is
not
a
single
one
of
our
citizens
present
who
considers
it
desirable
that
unreliable
and
exaggerated
accounts
of
the
sanitary
condition
of
the
baths
and
the
town
should
be
spread
abroad
several
voices
no
no
certainly
not
we
protest
against
it
peter
stockmann
therefore
i
should
like
to
propose
that
the
meeting
should
not
permit
the
medical
officer
either
to
read
or
to
comment
on
his
proposed
lecture
stockmann
impatiently
not
permit
what
the
devil
stockmann
coughing
ahem
stockmann
collecting
himself
very
well
go
ahead
peter
stockmann
in
my
communication
to
the
people
messenger
i
have
put
the
essential
facts
before
the
public
in
such
a
way
that
every
citizen
can
easily
form
his
own
opinion
from
it
you
will
see
that
the
main
result
of
the
medical
officer
proposals
apart
from
their
constituting
a
vote
of
censure
on
the
leading
men
of
the
town
would
be
to
saddle
the
ratepayers
with
an
unnecessary
expenditure
of
at
least
some
thousands
of
pounds
sounds
of
disapproval
among
the
audience
and
some
aslaksen
ringing
his
bell
silence
please
gentlemen
i
beg
to
support
the
mayor
motion
i
quite
agree
with
him
that
there
is
something
behind
this
agitation
started
by
the
doctor
he
talks
about
the
baths
but
it
is
a
revolution
he
is
aiming
at
he
wants
to
get
the
administration
of
the
town
put
into
new
hands
no
one
doubts
the
honesty
of
the
doctor
intentions
no
one
will
suggest
that
there
can
be
any
two
opinions
as
to
that
i
myself
am
a
believer
in
for
the
people
provided
it
does
not
fall
too
heavily
on
the
ratepayers
but
that
would
be
the
case
here
and
that
is
why
i
will
see
stockmann
damned
i
beg
your
pardon
before
i
go
with
him
in
the
matter
you
can
pay
too
dearly
for
a
thing
sometimes
that
is
my
opinion
loud
applause
on
all
sides
hovstad
i
too
feel
called
upon
to
explain
my
position
stockmann
agitation
appeared
to
be
gaining
a
certain
amount
of
sympathy
at
first
so
i
supported
it
as
impartially
as
i
could
but
presently
we
had
reason
to
suspect
that
we
had
allowed
ourselves
to
be
misled
by
misrepresentation
of
the
state
of
affairs
stockmann
misrepresentation
hovstad
well
let
us
say
a
not
entirely
trustworthy
representation
the
mayor
statement
has
proved
that
i
hope
no
one
here
has
any
doubt
as
to
my
liberal
principles
the
attitude
of
the
people
messenger
towards
important
political
questions
is
well
known
to
everyone
but
the
advice
of
experienced
and
thoughtful
men
has
convinced
me
that
in
purely
local
matters
a
newspaper
ought
to
proceed
with
a
certain
caution
aslaksen
i
entirely
agree
with
the
speaker
hovstad
and
in
the
matter
before
us
it
is
now
an
undoubted
fact
that
stockmann
has
public
opinion
against
him
now
what
is
an
first
and
most
obvious
duty
gentlemen
is
it
not
to
work
in
harmony
with
his
readers
has
he
not
received
a
sort
of
tacit
mandate
to
work
persistently
and
assiduously
for
the
welfare
of
those
whose
opinions
he
represents
or
is
it
possible
i
am
mistaken
in
that
voices
from
the
crowd
no
no
you
are
quite
right
hovstad
it
has
cost
me
a
severe
struggle
to
break
with
a
man
in
whose
house
i
have
been
lately
a
frequent
guest
a
man
who
till
today
has
been
able
to
pride
himself
on
the
undivided
goodwill
of
his
a
man
whose
only
or
at
all
events
whose
essential
failing
is
that
he
is
swayed
by
his
heart
rather
than
his
head
a
few
scattered
voices
that
is
true
bravo
stockmann
hovstad
but
my
duty
to
the
community
obliged
me
to
break
with
him
and
there
is
another
consideration
that
impels
me
to
oppose
him
and
as
far
as
possible
to
arrest
him
on
the
perilous
course
he
has
adopted
that
is
consideration
for
his
family
stockmann
please
stick
to
the
and
drainage
hovstad
consideration
i
repeat
for
his
wife
and
his
children
for
whom
he
has
made
no
provision
morten
is
that
us
mother
stockmann
hush
aslaksen
i
will
now
put
the
mayor
proposition
to
the
vote
stockmann
there
is
no
necessity
tonight
i
have
no
intention
of
dealing
with
all
that
filth
down
at
the
baths
no
i
have
something
quite
different
to
say
to
you
peter
stockmann
aside
what
is
coming
now
a
drunken
man
by
the
entrance
door
i
am
a
ratepayer
and
therefore
i
have
a
right
to
speak
too
and
my
entire
firm
inconceivable
opinion
is
a
number
of
voices
be
quiet
at
the
back
there
others
he
is
drunk
turn
him
out
they
turn
him
out
stockmann
am
i
allowed
to
speak
aslaksen
ringing
his
bell
stockmann
will
address
the
meeting
stockmann
i
should
like
to
have
seen
anyone
a
few
days
ago
dare
to
attempt
to
silence
me
as
has
been
done
tonight
i
would
have
defended
my
sacred
rights
as
a
man
like
a
lion
but
now
it
is
all
one
to
me
i
have
something
of
even
weightier
importance
to
say
to
you
the
crowd
presses
nearer
to
him
morten
kiil
conspicuous
among
them
stockmann
continuing
i
have
thought
and
pondered
a
great
deal
these
last
few
days
pondered
over
such
a
variety
of
things
that
in
the
end
my
head
seemed
too
full
to
hold
them
peter
stockmann
with
a
cough
ahem
stockmann
but
i
got
them
clear
in
my
mind
at
last
and
then
i
saw
the
whole
situation
lucidly
and
that
is
why
i
am
standing
here
i
have
a
great
revelation
to
make
to
you
my
i
will
impart
to
you
a
discovery
of
a
far
wider
scope
than
the
trifling
matter
that
our
water
supply
is
poisoned
and
our
medicinal
baths
are
standing
on
pestiferous
soil
a
number
of
voices
shouting
do
talk
about
the
baths
we
hear
you
none
of
that
stockmann
i
have
already
told
you
that
what
i
want
to
speak
about
is
the
great
discovery
i
have
made
lately
the
discovery
that
all
the
sources
of
our
moral
life
are
poisoned
and
that
the
whole
fabric
of
our
civic
community
is
founded
on
the
pestiferous
soil
of
falsehood
voices
of
disconcerted
citizens
what
is
that
he
says
peter
stockmann
such
an
insinuation
aslaksen
with
his
hand
on
his
bell
i
call
upon
the
speaker
to
moderate
his
language
stockmann
i
have
always
loved
my
native
town
as
a
man
only
can
love
the
home
of
his
youthful
days
i
was
not
old
when
i
went
away
from
here
and
exile
longing
and
memories
cast
as
it
were
an
additional
halo
over
both
the
town
and
its
inhabitants
some
clapping
and
applause
and
there
i
stayed
for
many
years
in
a
horrible
hole
far
away
up
north
when
i
came
into
contact
with
some
of
the
people
that
lived
scattered
about
among
the
rocks
i
often
thought
it
would
of
been
more
service
to
the
poor
creatures
if
a
veterinary
doctor
had
been
sent
up
there
instead
of
a
man
like
me
murmurs
among
the
crowd
billing
laying
down
his
pen
i
damned
if
i
have
ever
heard
hovstad
it
is
an
insult
to
a
respectable
population
stockmann
wait
a
bit
i
do
not
think
anyone
will
charge
me
with
having
forgotten
my
native
town
up
there
i
was
like
one
of
the
brooding
on
its
nest
and
what
i
hatched
was
the
plans
for
these
baths
applause
and
protests
and
then
when
fate
at
last
decreed
for
me
the
great
happiness
of
coming
home
again
i
assure
you
gentlemen
i
thought
i
had
nothing
more
in
the
world
to
wish
for
or
rather
there
was
one
thing
i
wished
for
eagerly
untiringly
ardently
and
that
was
to
be
able
to
be
of
service
to
my
native
town
and
the
good
of
the
community
peter
stockmann
looking
at
the
ceiling
you
chose
a
strange
way
of
doing
it
ahem
stockmann
and
so
with
my
eyes
blinded
to
the
real
facts
i
revelled
in
happiness
but
yesterday
morning
no
to
be
precise
it
was
yesterday
afternoon
the
eyes
of
my
mind
were
opened
wide
and
the
first
thing
i
realised
was
the
colossal
stupidity
of
the
authorities
uproar
shouts
and
laughter
stockmann
coughs
persistently
peter
stockmann
chairman
aslaksen
ringing
his
bell
by
virtue
of
my
authority
stockmann
it
is
a
petty
thing
to
catch
me
up
on
a
word
aslaksen
what
i
mean
is
only
that
i
got
scent
of
the
unbelievable
piggishness
our
leading
men
had
been
responsible
for
down
at
the
baths
i
ca
stand
leading
men
at
any
price
i
have
had
enough
of
such
people
in
my
time
they
are
like
on
a
young
plantation
they
do
mischief
everywhere
they
stand
in
a
free
man
way
whichever
way
he
turns
and
what
i
should
like
best
would
be
to
see
them
exterminated
like
any
other
vermin
uproar
peter
stockmann
chairman
can
we
allow
such
expressions
to
pass
aslaksen
with
his
hand
on
his
bell
doctor
stockmann
i
can
not
understand
how
it
is
that
i
have
only
now
acquired
a
clear
conception
of
what
these
gentry
are
when
i
had
almost
daily
before
my
eyes
in
this
town
such
an
excellent
specimen
of
them
my
brother
peter
and
in
prejudice
laughter
uproar
and
hisses
stockmann
sits
coughing
assiduously
aslaksen
rings
his
bell
violently
the
drunken
man
who
has
got
in
again
is
it
me
he
is
talking
about
my
name
petersen
all
right
but
devil
take
me
if
i
angry
voices
turn
out
that
drunken
man
turn
him
out
he
is
turned
out
again
peter
stockmann
who
was
that
person
citizen
i
do
know
who
he
is
mayor
citizen
he
does
belong
here
citizen
i
expect
he
is
a
navvy
from
over
at
the
rest
is
inaudible
aslaksen
he
had
obviously
had
too
much
beer
proceed
doctor
but
please
strive
to
be
moderate
in
your
language
stockmann
very
well
gentlemen
i
will
say
no
more
about
our
leading
men
and
if
anyone
imagines
from
what
i
have
just
said
that
my
object
is
to
attack
these
people
this
evening
he
is
wrong
absolutely
wide
of
the
mark
for
i
cherish
the
comforting
conviction
that
these
parasites
all
these
venerable
relics
of
a
dying
school
of
thought
are
most
admirably
paving
the
way
for
their
own
extinction
they
need
no
doctor
help
to
hasten
their
end
nor
is
it
folk
of
that
kind
who
constitute
the
most
pressing
danger
to
the
community
it
is
not
they
who
are
most
instrumental
in
poisoning
the
sources
of
our
moral
life
and
infecting
the
ground
on
which
we
stand
it
is
not
they
who
are
the
most
dangerous
enemies
of
truth
and
freedom
amongst
us
shouts
from
all
sides
who
then
who
is
it
name
name
stockmann
you
may
depend
upon
it
i
shall
name
them
that
is
precisely
the
great
discovery
i
made
yesterday
raises
his
voice
the
most
dangerous
enemy
of
truth
and
freedom
amongst
us
is
the
compact
majority
yes
the
damned
compact
liberal
majority
that
is
it
now
you
know
tremendous
uproar
most
of
the
crowd
are
shouting
stamping
and
hissing
some
of
the
older
men
among
them
exchange
stolen
glances
and
seem
to
be
enjoying
themselves
stockmann
gets
up
looking
anxious
ejlif
and
morten
advance
threateningly
upon
some
schoolboys
who
are
playing
pranks
aslaksen
rings
his
bell
and
begs
for
silence
hovstad
and
billing
both
talk
at
once
but
are
inaudible
at
last
quiet
is
restored
aslaksen
as
chairman
i
call
upon
the
speaker
to
withdraw
the
expressions
he
has
just
used
stockmann
never
aslaksen
it
is
the
majority
in
our
community
that
denies
me
my
freedom
and
seeks
to
prevent
my
speaking
the
truth
hovstad
the
majority
always
has
right
on
its
side
billing
and
truth
too
by
god
stockmann
the
majority
never
has
right
on
its
side
never
i
say
that
is
one
of
these
social
lies
against
which
an
independent
intelligent
man
must
wage
war
who
is
it
that
constitute
the
majority
of
the
population
in
a
country
is
it
the
clever
folk
or
the
stupid
i
do
imagine
you
will
dispute
the
fact
that
at
present
the
stupid
people
are
in
an
absolutely
overwhelming
majority
all
the
world
over
but
good
lord
you
can
never
pretend
that
it
is
right
that
the
stupid
folk
should
govern
the
clever
ones
uproar
and
cries
oh
yes
you
can
shout
me
down
i
know
but
you
can
not
answer
me
the
majority
has
might
on
its
side
unfortunately
but
right
it
has
not
i
am
in
the
right
i
and
a
few
other
scattered
individuals
the
minority
is
always
in
the
right
renewed
uproar
hovstad
aha
so
stockmann
has
become
an
aristocrat
since
the
day
before
yesterday
stockmann
i
have
already
said
that
i
do
intend
to
waste
a
word
on
the
puny
crew
whom
we
are
leaving
astern
pulsating
life
no
longer
concerns
itself
with
them
i
am
thinking
of
the
few
the
scattered
few
amongst
us
who
have
absorbed
new
and
vigorous
truths
such
men
stand
as
it
were
at
the
outposts
so
far
ahead
that
the
compact
majority
has
not
yet
been
able
to
come
up
with
them
and
there
they
are
fighting
for
truths
that
are
too
into
the
world
of
consciousness
to
have
any
considerable
number
of
people
on
their
side
as
yet
hovstad
so
the
doctor
is
a
revolutionary
now
stockmann
good
heavens
of
course
i
am
hovstad
i
propose
to
raise
a
revolution
against
the
lie
that
the
majority
has
the
monopoly
of
the
truth
what
sort
of
truths
are
they
that
the
majority
usually
supports
they
are
truths
that
are
of
such
advanced
age
that
they
are
beginning
to
break
up
and
if
a
truth
is
as
old
as
that
it
is
also
in
a
fair
way
to
become
a
lie
gentlemen
laughter
and
mocking
cries
yes
believe
me
or
not
as
you
like
but
truths
are
by
no
means
as
at
methuselah
as
some
folk
imagine
a
normally
constituted
truth
lives
let
us
say
as
a
rule
seventeen
or
eighteen
or
at
most
twenty
years
seldom
longer
but
truths
as
aged
as
that
are
always
worn
frightfully
thin
and
nevertheless
it
is
only
then
that
the
majority
recognises
them
and
recommends
them
to
the
community
as
wholesome
moral
nourishment
there
is
no
great
nutritive
value
in
that
sort
of
fare
i
can
assure
you
and
as
a
doctor
i
ought
to
know
these
majority
truths
are
like
last
year
cured
meat
like
rancid
tainted
ham
and
they
are
the
origin
of
the
moral
scurvy
that
is
rampant
in
our
communities
aslaksen
it
appears
to
me
that
the
speaker
is
wandering
a
long
way
from
his
subject
peter
stockmann
i
quite
agree
with
the
chairman
stockmann
have
you
gone
clean
out
of
your
senses
peter
i
am
sticking
as
closely
to
my
subject
as
i
can
for
my
subject
is
precisely
this
that
it
is
the
masses
the
majority
this
infernal
compact
majority
that
poisons
the
sources
of
our
moral
life
and
infects
the
ground
we
stand
on
hovstad
and
all
this
because
the
great
broadminded
majority
of
the
people
is
prudent
enough
to
show
deference
only
to
and
truths
stockmann
ah
my
good
hovstad
do
talk
nonsense
about
truths
the
truths
of
which
the
masses
now
approve
are
the
very
truths
that
the
fighters
at
the
outposts
held
to
in
the
days
of
our
grandfathers
we
fighters
at
the
outposts
nowadays
no
longer
approve
of
them
and
i
do
not
believe
there
is
any
other
truth
except
this
that
no
community
can
live
a
healthy
life
if
it
is
nourished
only
on
such
old
marrowless
truths
hovstad
but
instead
of
standing
there
using
vague
generalities
it
would
be
interesting
if
you
would
tell
us
what
these
old
marrowless
truths
are
that
we
are
nourished
on
applause
from
many
quarters
stockmann
oh
i
could
give
you
a
whole
string
of
such
abominations
but
to
begin
with
i
will
confine
myself
to
one
truth
which
at
bottom
is
a
foul
lie
but
upon
which
nevertheless
hovstad
and
the
people
messenger
and
all
the
messenger
supporters
are
nourished
hovstad
and
that
is
stockmann
that
is
the
doctrine
you
have
inherited
from
your
forefathers
and
proclaim
thoughtlessly
far
and
wide
the
doctrine
that
the
public
the
crowd
the
masses
are
the
essential
part
of
the
population
that
they
constitute
the
people
that
the
common
folk
the
ignorant
and
incomplete
element
in
the
community
have
the
same
right
to
pronounce
judgment
and
to
approve
to
direct
and
to
govern
as
the
isolated
intellectually
superior
personalities
in
it
billing
well
damn
me
if
ever
i
hovstad
at
the
same
time
shouting
out
take
good
note
of
that
a
number
of
voices
angrily
oho
we
are
not
the
people
only
the
superior
folk
are
to
govern
are
they
a
workman
turn
the
fellow
out
for
talking
such
rubbish
another
out
with
him
another
calling
out
blow
your
horn
evensen
a
horn
is
blown
loudly
amidst
hisses
and
an
angry
uproar
stockmann
when
the
noise
has
somewhat
abated
be
reasonable
ca
you
stand
hearing
the
voice
of
truth
for
once
i
do
in
the
least
expect
you
to
agree
with
me
all
at
once
but
i
must
say
i
did
expect
hovstad
to
admit
i
was
right
when
he
had
recovered
his
composure
a
little
he
claims
to
be
a
freethinker
voices
in
murmurs
of
astonishment
freethinker
did
he
say
is
hovstad
a
freethinker
hovstad
shouting
prove
it
stockmann
when
have
i
said
so
in
print
stockmann
reflecting
no
confound
it
you
are
right
you
have
never
had
the
courage
to
well
i
wo
put
you
in
a
hole
hovstad
let
us
say
it
is
i
that
am
the
freethinker
then
i
am
going
to
prove
to
you
scientifically
that
the
people
messenger
leads
you
by
the
nose
in
a
shameful
manner
when
it
tells
you
that
you
that
the
common
people
the
crowd
the
masses
are
the
real
essence
of
the
people
that
is
only
a
newspaper
lie
i
tell
you
the
common
people
are
nothing
more
than
the
raw
material
of
which
a
people
is
made
groans
laughter
and
uproar
well
is
that
the
case
is
there
an
enormous
difference
between
a
and
an
strain
of
animals
take
for
instance
a
common
hen
what
sort
of
eating
do
you
get
from
a
shrivelled
up
old
scrag
of
a
fowl
like
that
not
much
do
you
and
what
sort
of
eggs
does
it
lay
a
fairly
good
crow
or
a
raven
can
lay
pretty
nearly
as
good
an
egg
but
take
a
spanish
or
japanese
hen
or
a
good
pheasant
or
a
turkey
then
you
will
see
the
difference
or
take
the
case
of
dogs
with
whom
we
humans
are
on
such
intimate
terms
think
first
of
an
ordinary
common
cur
i
mean
one
of
the
horrible
curs
that
do
nothing
but
run
about
the
streets
and
befoul
the
walls
of
the
houses
compare
one
of
these
curs
with
a
poodle
whose
sires
for
many
generations
have
been
bred
in
a
house
where
they
have
had
the
best
of
food
and
had
the
opportunity
of
hearing
soft
voices
and
music
do
you
not
think
that
the
poodle
brain
is
developed
to
quite
a
different
degree
from
that
of
the
cur
of
course
it
is
it
is
puppies
of
poodles
like
that
that
showmen
train
to
do
incredibly
clever
tricks
things
that
a
common
cur
could
never
learn
to
do
even
if
it
stood
on
its
head
uproar
and
mocking
cries
a
citizen
calls
out
are
you
going
to
make
out
we
are
dogs
now
another
citizen
we
are
not
animals
doctor
stockmann
yes
but
bless
my
soul
we
are
my
friend
it
is
true
we
are
the
finest
animals
anyone
could
wish
for
but
even
among
us
exceptionally
fine
animals
are
rare
there
is
a
tremendous
difference
between
and
and
the
amusing
part
of
it
is
that
hovstad
quite
agrees
with
me
as
long
as
it
is
a
question
of
animals
hovstad
yes
it
is
true
enough
as
far
as
they
are
concerned
stockmann
very
well
but
as
soon
as
i
extend
the
principle
and
apply
it
to
animals
hovstad
stops
short
he
no
longer
dares
to
think
independently
or
to
pursue
his
ideas
to
their
logical
conclusion
so
he
turns
the
whole
theory
upside
down
and
proclaims
in
the
people
messenger
that
it
is
the
hens
and
street
curs
that
are
the
finest
specimens
in
the
menagerie
but
that
is
always
the
way
as
long
as
a
man
retains
the
traces
of
common
origin
and
has
not
worked
his
way
up
to
intellectual
distinction
hovstad
i
lay
no
claim
to
any
sort
of
distinction
i
am
the
son
of
humble
and
i
am
proud
that
the
stock
i
come
from
is
rooted
deep
among
the
common
people
he
insults
voices
bravo
hovstad
bravo
bravo
stockmann
the
kind
of
common
people
i
mean
are
not
only
to
be
found
low
down
in
the
social
scale
they
crawl
and
swarm
all
around
us
even
in
the
highest
social
positions
you
have
only
to
look
at
your
own
fine
distinguished
mayor
my
brother
peter
is
every
bit
as
plebeian
as
anyone
that
walks
in
two
shoes
laughter
and
hisses
peter
stockmann
i
protest
against
personal
allusions
of
this
kind
stockmann
imperturbably
and
that
not
because
he
is
like
myself
descended
from
some
old
rascal
of
a
pirate
from
pomerania
or
thereabouts
because
that
is
who
we
are
descended
from
peter
stockmann
an
absurd
legend
i
deny
it
stockmann
but
because
he
thinks
what
his
superiors
think
and
holds
the
same
opinions
as
they
people
who
do
that
are
intellectually
speaking
common
people
and
that
is
why
my
magnificent
brother
peter
is
in
reality
so
very
far
from
any
distinction
and
consequently
also
so
far
from
being
peter
stockmann
chairman
hovstad
so
it
is
only
the
distinguished
men
that
are
in
this
country
we
are
learning
something
quite
new
laughter
stockmann
yes
that
is
part
of
my
new
discovery
too
and
another
part
of
it
is
that
is
almost
precisely
the
same
thing
as
morality
that
is
why
i
maintain
that
it
is
absolutely
inexcusable
in
the
people
messenger
to
proclaim
day
in
and
day
out
the
false
doctrine
that
it
is
the
masses
the
crowd
the
compact
majority
that
have
the
monopoly
of
and
morality
and
that
vice
and
corruption
and
every
kind
of
intellectual
depravity
are
the
result
of
culture
just
as
all
the
filth
that
is
draining
into
our
baths
is
the
result
of
the
tanneries
up
at
molledal
uproar
and
interruptions
stockmann
is
undisturbed
and
goes
on
carried
away
by
his
ardour
with
a
smile
and
yet
this
same
people
messenger
can
go
on
preaching
that
the
masses
ought
to
be
elevated
to
higher
conditions
of
life
but
bless
my
soul
if
the
messenger
teaching
is
to
be
depended
upon
this
very
raising
up
the
masses
would
mean
nothing
more
or
less
than
setting
them
straightway
upon
the
paths
of
depravity
happily
the
theory
that
culture
demoralises
is
only
an
old
falsehood
that
our
forefathers
believed
in
and
we
have
inherited
no
it
is
ignorance
poverty
ugly
conditions
of
life
that
do
the
devil
work
in
a
house
which
does
not
get
aired
and
swept
every
day
my
wife
katherine
maintains
that
the
floor
ought
to
be
scrubbed
as
well
but
that
is
a
debatable
question
in
such
a
house
let
me
tell
you
people
will
lose
within
two
or
three
years
the
power
of
thinking
or
acting
in
a
moral
manner
lack
of
oxygen
weakens
the
conscience
and
there
must
be
a
plentiful
lack
of
oxygen
in
very
many
houses
in
this
town
i
should
think
judging
from
the
fact
that
the
whole
compact
majority
can
be
unconscientious
enough
to
wish
to
build
the
town
prosperity
on
a
quagmire
of
falsehood
and
deceit
aslaksen
we
can
not
allow
such
a
grave
accusation
to
be
flung
at
a
citizen
community
a
citizen
i
move
that
the
chairman
direct
the
speaker
to
sit
down
voices
angrily
hear
hear
quite
right
make
him
sit
down
stockmann
losing
his
then
i
will
go
and
shout
the
truth
at
every
street
corner
i
will
write
it
in
other
newspapers
the
whole
country
shall
know
what
is
going
on
here
hovstad
it
almost
seems
as
if
stockmann
intention
were
to
ruin
the
town
stockmann
yes
my
native
town
is
so
dear
to
me
that
i
would
rather
ruin
it
than
see
it
flourishing
upon
a
lie
aslaksen
this
is
really
serious
uproar
and
stockmann
coughs
but
to
no
purpose
her
husband
does
not
listen
to
her
any
longer
hovstad
shouting
above
the
din
a
man
must
be
a
public
enemy
to
wish
to
ruin
a
whole
community
stockmann
with
growing
fervor
what
does
the
destruction
of
a
community
matter
if
it
lives
on
lies
it
ought
to
be
razed
to
the
ground
i
tell
you
all
who
live
by
lies
ought
to
be
exterminated
like
vermin
you
will
end
by
infecting
the
whole
country
you
will
bring
about
such
a
state
of
things
that
the
whole
country
will
deserve
to
be
ruined
and
if
things
come
to
that
pass
i
shall
say
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
let
the
whole
country
perish
let
all
these
people
be
exterminated
voices
from
the
crowd
that
is
talking
like
an
enemy
of
the
people
billing
there
sounded
the
voice
of
the
people
by
all
that
holy
the
whole
crowd
shouting
yes
yes
he
is
an
enemy
of
the
people
he
hates
his
country
he
hates
his
own
people
aslaksen
both
as
a
citizen
and
as
an
individual
i
am
profoundly
disturbed
by
what
we
have
had
to
listen
to
stockmann
has
shown
himself
in
a
light
i
should
never
have
dreamed
of
i
am
unhappily
obliged
to
subscribe
to
the
opinion
which
i
have
just
heard
my
estimable
utter
and
i
propose
that
we
should
give
expression
to
that
opinion
in
a
resolution
i
propose
a
resolution
as
follows
this
meeting
declares
that
it
considers
thomas
stockmann
medical
officer
of
the
baths
to
be
an
enemy
of
the
people
a
storm
of
cheers
and
applause
a
number
of
men
surround
the
doctor
and
hiss
him
stockmann
and
petra
have
got
up
from
their
seats
morten
and
ejlif
are
fighting
the
other
schoolboys
for
hissing
some
of
their
elders
separate
them
stockmann
to
the
men
who
are
hissing
him
oh
you
fools
i
tell
you
that
aslaksen
ringing
his
bell
we
can
not
hear
you
now
doctor
a
formal
vote
is
about
to
be
taken
but
out
of
regard
for
personal
feelings
it
shall
be
by
ballot
and
not
verbal
have
you
any
clean
paper
mr
billing
billing
i
have
both
blue
and
white
here
aslaksen
going
to
him
that

get
on
more
quickly
that
way
cut

up
into
small
strips
yes
that
it
to
the
meeting
blue
means
no
white
means
yes
i
will
come
round
myself
and
collect
votes
peter
stockmann
leaves
the
hall
aslaksen
and
one
or
two
others
go
round
the
room
with
the
slips
of
paper
in
their
hats
citizen
to
hovstad
i
say
what
has
come
to
the
doctor

are
we
to
think
of
it
hovstad
oh

know
how
headstrong
he
is
citizen
to
billing
billing

go
to
their
house

noticed
if
the
fellow
drinks
billing
well
i
hanged
if
i
know
what
to
say
there
are
always
spirits
on
the
table
when
you
go
citizen
i
rather
think
he
goes
quite
off
his
head
sometimes
citizen
i
wonder
if
there
is
any
madness
in
his
family
billing
i
should
wonder
if
there
were
citizen
no
it
is
nothing
more
than
sheer
malice
he
wants
to
get
even
with
somebody
for
something
or
other
billing
well
certainly
he
suggested
a
rise
in
his
salary
on
one
occasion
lately
and
did
not
get
it
the
citizens
together
ah
then
it
is
easy
to
understand
how
it
is
the
drunken
man

heap

others
on

table
i
shall
treasure
these
stones
as
relics
ejlif
and

are

deuce

name
the
girl
you
know
has
she
been
to
fetch
the
glazier
yet
stockmann
coming
in
yes
but
he
said
he
did
know
if
he
would
be
able
to
come
today
stockmann
you
will
see
he
wo
dare
to
come
stockmann
well
that
is
just
what
randine
thought
that
he
dare
to
on
account
of
the
neighbours
calls
into
the
what
is
it
you
want
randine
give
it
to
me
goes
in
and
comes
out
again
directly
here
is
a
letter
for
you
thomas
stockmann
let
me
see
it
opens
and
reads
it
ah
of
course
stockmann
who
is
it
from
stockmann
from
the
landlord
notice
to
quit
stockmann
is
it
possible
such
a
nice
man
stockmann
looking
at
the
letter
does
not
dare
do
otherwise
he
says
does
like
doing
it
but
dare
not
do
otherwise
on
account
of
his
out
of
regard
for
public
opinion
is
in
a
dependent
position
dares
not
offend
certain
influential
men
stockmann
there
you
see
thomas
stockmann
yes
yes
i
see
well
enough
the
whole
lot
of
them
in
the
town
are
cowards
not
a
man
among
them
dares
do
anything
for
fear
of
the
others
throws
the
letter
on
to
the
table
but
it
matter
to
us
katherine
we
are
going
to
sail
away
to
the
new
world
and
stockmann
but
thomas
are
you
sure
we
are
well
advised
to
take
this
step
stockmann
are
you
suggesting
that
i
should
stay
here
where
they
have
pilloried
me
as
an
enemy
of
the
people
branded
me
broken
my
windows
and
just
look
here
katherine
they
have
torn
a
great
rent
in
my
black
trousers
too
stockmann
oh
dear
and
they
are
the
best
pair
you
have
got
stockmann
you
should
never
wear
your
best
trousers
when
you
go
out
to
fight
for
freedom
and
truth
it
is
not
that
i
care
so
much
about
the
trousers
you
know
you
can
always
sew
them
up
again
for
me
but
that
the
common
herd
should
dare
to
make
this
attack
on
me
as
if
they
were
my
equals
that
is
what
i
can
not
for
the
life
of
me
swallow
stockmann
there
is
no
doubt
they
have
behaved
very
ill
toward
you
thomas
but
is
that
sufficient
reason
for
our
leaving
our
native
country
for
good
and
all
stockmann
if
we
went
to
another
town
do
you
suppose
we
should
not
find
the
common
people
just
as
insolent
as
they
are
here
depend
upon
it
there
is
not
much
to
choose
between
them
oh
well
let
the
curs
snap
that
is
not
the
worst
part
of
it
the
worst
is
that
from
one
end
of
this
country
to
the
other
every
man
is
the
slave
of
his
party
although
as
far
as
that
goes
i
daresay
it
is
not
much
better
in
the
free
west
either
the
compact
majority
and
liberal
public
opinion
and
all
that
infernal
old
bag
of
tricks
are
probably
rampant
there
too
but
there
things
are
done
on
a
larger
scale
you
see
they
may
kill
you
but
they
wo
put
you
to
death
by
slow
torture
they
do
squeeze
a
free
man
soul
in
a
vice
as
they
do
here
and
if
need
be
one
can
live
in
solitude
walks
up
and
down
if
only
i
knew
where
there
was
a
virgin
forest
or
a
small
south
sea
island
for
sale
cheap
stockmann
but
think
of
the
boys
thomas
stockmann
standing
still
what
a
strange
woman
you
are
katherine
would
you
prefer
to
have
the
boys
grow
up
in
a
society
like
this
you
saw
for
yourself
last
night
that
half
the
population
are
out
of
their
minds
and
if
the
other
half
have
not
lost
their
senses
it
is
because
they
are
mere
brutes
with
no
sense
to
lose
stockmann
but
thomas
dear
the
imprudent
things
you
said
had
something
to
do
with
it
you
know
stockmann
well
is
what
i
said
perfectly
true
do
they
turn
every
idea
do
they
make
a
regular
hotchpotch
of
right
and
wrong
do
they
say
that
the
things
i
know
are
true
are
lies
the
craziest
part
of
it
all
is
the
fact
of
these
liberals
men
of
full
age
going
about
in
crowds
imagining
that
they
are
the
party
did
you
ever
hear
anything
like
it
katherine
stockmann
yes
yes
it
mad
enough
of
them
certainly
but
petra
comes
in
from
the
back
from
school
already
petra
yes
i
have
been
given
notice
of
dismissal
stockmann
dismissal
stockmann
you
too
petra
busk
gave
me
my
notice
so
i
thought
it
was
best
to
go
at
once
stockmann
you
were
perfectly
right
too
stockmann
who
would
have
thought
busk
was
a
woman
like
that
petra
busk
is
a
bit
like
that
mother
i
saw
quite
plainly
how
it
hurt
her
to
do
it
but
she
did
dare
do
otherwise
she
said
and
so
i
got
my
notice
stockmann
laughing
and
rubbing
his
hands
she
did
dare
do
otherwise
either
it
delicious
stockmann
well
after
the
dreadful
scenes
last
night
petra
it
was
not
only
that
just
listen
to
this
father
stockmann
well
petra
busk
showed
me
no
less
than
three
letters
she
received
this
morning
stockmann
anonymous
i
suppose
petra
yes
stockmann
yes
because
they
did
dare
to
risk
signing
their
names
katherine
petra
and
two
of
them
were
to
the
effect
that
a
man
who
has
been
our
guest
here
was
declaring
last
night
at
the
club
that
my
views
on
various
subjects
are
extremely
emancipated
stockmann
you
did
not
deny
that
i
hope
petra
no
you
know
i
would
busk
own
views
are
tolerably
emancipated
when
we
are
alone
together
but
now
that
this
report
about
me
is
being
spread
she
dare
not
keep
me
on
any
longer
stockmann
and
someone
who
had
been
a
guest
of
ours
that
shows
you
the
return
you
get
for
your
hospitality
thomas
stockmann
we
wo
live
in
such
a
disgusting
hole
any
longer
pack
up
as
quickly
as
you
can
katherine
the
sooner
we
can
get
away
the
better
stockmann
be
quiet
i
think
i
hear
someone
in
the
hall
see
who
it
is
petra
petra
opening
the
door
oh
it
you
captain
horster
do
come
in
horster
coming
in
good
morning
i
thought
i
would
just
come
in
and
see
how
you
were
stockmann
shaking
his
hand
thanks
that
is
really
kind
of
you
stockmann
and
thank
you
too
for
helping
us
through
the
crowd
captain
horster
petra
how
did
you
manage
to
get
home
again
horster
oh
somehow
or
other
i
am
fairly
strong
and
there
is
more
sound
than
fury
about
these
folk
stockmann
yes
is
their
swinish
cowardice
astonishing
look
here
i
will
show
you
something
there
are
all
the
stones
they
have
thrown
through
my
windows
just
look
at
them
i
hanged
if
there
are
more
than
two
decently
large
bits
of
hard
stone
in
the
whole
heap
the
rest
are
nothing
but
gravel
wretched
little
things
and
yet
they
stood
out
there
bawling
and
swearing
that
they
would
do
me
some
violence
but
as
for
doing
anything
you
do
see
much
of
that
in
this
town
horster
just
as
well
for
you
this
time
doctor
stockmann
true
enough
but
it
makes
one
angry
all
the
same
because
if
some
day
it
should
be
a
question
of
a
national
fight
in
real
earnest
you
will
see
that
public
opinion
will
be
in
favour
of
taking
to
one
heels
and
the
compact
majority
will
turn
tail
like
a
flock
of
sheep
captain
horster
that
is
what
is
so
mournful
to
think
of
it
gives
me
so
much
concern
that
no
devil
take
it
it
is
ridiculous
to
care
about
it
they
have
called
me
an
enemy
of
the
people
so
an
enemy
of
the
people
let
me
be
stockmann
you
will
never
be
that
thomas
stockmann
do
swear
to
that
katherine
to
be
called
an
ugly
name
may
have
the
same
effect
as
a
in
the
lung
and
that
hateful
name
i
ca
get
quit
of
it
it
is
sticking
here
in
the
pit
of
my
stomach
eating
into
me
like
a
corrosive
acid
and
no
magnesia
will
remove
it
petra
bah
you
should
only
laugh
at
them
father
horster
they
will
change
their
minds
some
day
doctor
stockmann
yes
thomas
as
sure
as
you
are
standing
here
stockmann
perhaps
when
it
is
too
late
much
good
may
it
do
them
they
may
wallow
in
their
filth
then
and
rue
the
day
when
they
drove
a
patriot
into
exile
when
do
you
sail
captain
horster
horster
hm
that
was
just
what
i
had
come
to
speak
about
stockmann
why
has
anything
gone
wrong
with
the
ship
horster
no
but
what
has
happened
is
that
i
am
not
to
sail
in
it
petra
do
you
mean
that
you
have
been
dismissed
from
your
command
horster
smiling
yes
that
just
it
petra
you
too
stockmann
there
you
see
thomas
stockmann
and
that
for
the
truth
sake
oh
if
i
had
thought
such
a
thing
possible
horster
you
must
take
it
to
heart
i
shall
be
sure
to
find
a
job
with
some
or
other
elsewhere
stockmann
and
that
is
this
man
vik
a
wealthy
man
independent
of
everyone
and
everything
shame
on
him
horster
he
is
quite
an
excellent
fellow
otherwise
he
told
me
himself
he
would
willingly
have
kept
me
on
if
only
he
had
dared
stockmann
but
he
did
dare
no
of
course
not
horster
it
is
not
such
an
easy
matter
he
said
for
a
party
man
stockmann
the
worthy
man
spoke
the
truth
a
party
is
like
a
sausage
machine
it
mashes
up
all
sorts
of
heads
together
into
the
same
mincemeat
fatheads
and
blockheads
all
in
one
mash
stockmann
come
come
thomas
dear
petra
to
horster
if
only
you
had
not
come
home
with
us
things
might
not
have
come
to
this
pass
horster
i
do
not
regret
it
petra
holding
out
her
hand
to
him
thank
you
for
that
horster
to
stockmann
and
so
what
i
came
to
say
was
that
if
you
are
determined
to
go
away
i
have
thought
of
another
plan
stockmann
that
splendid
if
only
we
can
get
away
at
once
stockmann
hush
was
that
some
one
knocking
petra
that
is
uncle
surely
stockmann
aha
calls
out
come
in
stockmann
dear
thomas
promise
me
definitely
peter
stockmann
comes
in
from
the
hall
peter
stockmann
oh
you
are
engaged
in
that
case
i
will
stockmann
no
no
come
in
peter
stockmann
but
i
wanted
to
speak
to
you
alone
stockmann
we
will
go
into
the
in
the
meanwhile
horster
and
i
will
look
in
again
later
stockmann
no
go
in
there
with
them
captain
horster
i
want
to
hear
more
about
horster
very
well
i
will
wait
then
he
follows
stockmann
and
petra
into
the
stockmann
i
daresay
you
find
it
rather
draughty
here
today
put
your
hat
on
peter
stockmann
thank
you
if
i
may
does
so
i
think
i
caught
cold
last
night
i
stood
and
shivered
stockmann
really
i
found
it
warm
enough
peter
stockmann
i
regret
that
it
was
not
in
my
power
to
prevent
those
excesses
last
night
stockmann
have
you
anything
in
particular
to
say
to
me
besides
that
peter
stockmann
taking
a
big
letter
from
his
pocket
i
have
this
document
for
you
from
the
baths
committee
stockmann
my
dismissal
peter
stockmann
yes
dating
from
today
lays
the
letter
on
the
table
it
gives
us
pain
to
do
it
but
to
speak
frankly
we
dared
not
do
otherwise
on
account
of
public
opinion
stockmann
smiling
dared
not
i
seem
to
have
heard
that
word
before
today
peter
stockmann
i
must
beg
you
to
understand
your
position
clearly
for
the
future
you
must
not
count
on
any
practice
whatever
in
the
town
stockmann
devil
take
the
practice
but
why
are
you
so
sure
of
that
peter
stockmann
the
householders
association
is
circulating
a
list
from
house
to
house
all
citizens
are
being
called
upon
to
give
up
employing
you
and
i
can
assure
you
that
not
a
single
head
of
a
family
will
risk
refusing
his
signature
they
simply
dare
not
stockmann
no
no
i
do
doubt
it
but
what
then
peter
stockmann
if
i
might
advise
you
it
would
be
best
to
leave
the
place
for
a
little
while
stockmann
yes
the
propriety
of
leaving
the
place
has
occurred
to
me
peter
stockmann
good
and
then
when
you
have
had
six
months
to
think
things
over
if
after
mature
consideration
you
can
persuade
yourself
to
write
a
few
words
of
regret
acknowledging
your
error
stockmann
i
might
have
my
appointment
restored
to
me
do
you
mean
peter
stockmann
perhaps
it
is
not
at
all
impossible
stockmann
but
what
about
public
opinion
then
surely
you
would
not
dare
to
do
it
on
account
of
public
feeling
peter
stockmann
public
opinion
is
an
extremely
mutable
thing
and
to
be
quite
candid
with
you
it
is
a
matter
of
great
importance
to
us
to
have
some
admission
of
that
sort
from
you
in
writing
stockmann
oh
that
what
you
are
after
is
it
i
will
just
trouble
you
to
remember
what
i
said
to
you
lately
about
foxy
tricks
of
that
sort
peter
stockmann
your
position
was
quite
different
then
at
that
time
you
had
reason
to
suppose
you
had
the
whole
town
at
your
back
stockmann
yes
and
now
i
feel
i
have
the
whole
town
on
my
back
flaring
up
i
would
not
do
it
if
i
had
the
devil
and
his
dam
on
my
back
never
never
i
tell
you
peter
stockmann
a
man
with
a
family
has
no
right
to
behave
as
you
do
you
have
no
right
to
do
it
thomas
stockmann
i
have
no
right
there
is
only
one
single
thing
in
the
world
a
free
man
has
no
right
to
do
do
you
know
what
that
is
peter
stockmann
no
stockmann
of
course
you
do
but
i
will
tell
you
a
free
man
has
no
right
to
soil
himself
with
filth
he
has
no
right
to
behave
in
a
way
that
would
justify
his
spitting
in
his
own
face
peter
stockmann
this
sort
of
thing
sounds
extremely
plausible
of
course
and
if
there
were
no
other
explanation
for
your
obstinacy
but
as
it
happens
that
there
is
stockmann
what
do
you
mean
peter
stockmann
you
understand
very
well
what
i
mean
but
as
your
brother
and
as
a
man
of
discretion
i
advise
you
not
to
build
too
much
upon
expectations
and
prospects
that
may
so
very
easily
fail
you
stockmann
what
in
the
world
is
all
this
about
peter
stockmann
do
you
really
ask
me
to
believe
that
you
are
ignorant
of
the
terms
of
kiil
will
stockmann
i
know
that
the
small
amount
he
possesses
is
to
go
to
an
institution
for
indigent
old
workpeople
how
does
that
concern
me
peter
stockmann
in
the
first
place
it
is
by
no
means
a
small
amount
that
is
in
question
kiil
is
a
fairly
wealthy
man
stockmann
i
had
no
notion
of
that
peter
stockmann
hm
had
you
really
then
i
suppose
you
had
no
notion
either
that
a
considerable
portion
of
his
wealth
will
come
to
your
children
you
and
your
wife
having
a
of
the
capital
has
he
never
told
you
so
stockmann
never
on
my
honour
quite
the
reverse
he
has
consistently
done
nothing
but
fume
at
being
so
unconscionably
heavily
taxed
but
are
you
perfectly
certain
of
this
peter
peter
stockmann
i
have
it
from
an
absolutely
reliable
source
stockmann
then
thank
god
katherine
is
provided
for
and
the
children
too
i
must
tell
her
this
at
once
calls
out
katherine
katherine
peter
stockmann
restraining
him
hush
do
say
a
word
yet
stockmann
opening
the
door
what
is
the
matter
stockmann
oh
nothing
nothing
you
can
go
back
she
shuts
the
door
stockmann
walks
up
and
down
in
his
excitement
provided
for
just
think
of
it
we
are
all
provided
for
and
for
life
what
a
blessed
feeling
it
is
to
know
one
is
provided
for
peter
stockmann
yes
but
that
is
just
exactly
what
you
are
not
kiil
can
alter
his
will
any
day
he
likes
stockmann
but
he
wo
do
that
my
dear
peter
the
badger
is
much
too
delighted
at
my
attack
on
you
and
your
wise
friends
peter
stockmann
starts
and
looks
intently
at
him
ah
that
throws
a
light
on
various
things
stockmann
what
things
peter
stockmann
i
see
that
the
whole
thing
was
a
combined
manoeuvre
on
your
part
and
his
these
violent
reckless
attacks
that
you
have
made
against
the
leading
men
of
the
town
under
the
pretence
that
it
was
in
the
name
of
truth
stockmann
what
about
them
peter
stockmann
i
see
that
they
were
nothing
else
than
the
stipulated
price
for
that
vindictive
old
man
will
stockmann
almost
speechless
peter
you
are
the
most
disgusting
plebeian
i
have
ever
met
in
all
my
life
peter
stockmann
all
is
over
between
us
your
dismissal
is
irrevocable
we
have
a
weapon
against
you
now
goes
out
stockmann
for
shame
for
shame
calls
out
katherine
you
must
have
the
floor
scrubbed
after
him
let
what
her
name
devil
take
it
the
girl
who
has
always
got
soot
on
her
nose
stockmann
in
the
hush
thomas
be
quiet
petra
coming
to
the
door
father
grandfather
is
here
asking
if
he
may
speak
to
you
alone
stockmann
certainly
he
may
going
to
the
door
come
in
kiil
morten
kiil
comes
in
stockmann
shuts
the
door
after
him
what
can
i
do
for
you
wo
you
sit
down
morten
kiil
i
wo
sit
looks
around
you
look
very
comfortable
here
today
thomas
stockmann
yes
do
we
morten
kiil
very
comfortable
plenty
of
fresh
air
i
should
think
you
have
got
enough
of
that
oxygen
you
were
talking
about
yesterday
your
conscience
must
be
in
splendid
order
i
should
think
stockmann
it
is
morten
kiil
so
i
should
think
taps
his
chest
do
you
know
what
i
have
got
here
stockmann
a
good
conscience
too
i
hope
morten
kiil
bah
no
it
is
something
better
than
that
he
takes
a
thick
from
his
opens
it
and
displays
a
packet
of
papers
stockmann
looking
at
him
in
astonishment
shares
in
the
baths
morten
kiil
they
were
not
difficult
to
get
today
stockmann
and
you
have
been
buying
morten
kiil
as
many
as
i
could
pay
for
stockmann
but
my
dear
kiil
consider
the
state
of
the
affairs
morten
kiil
if
you
behave
like
a
reasonable
man
you
can
soon
set
the
baths
on
their
feet
again
stockmann
well
you
can
see
for
yourself
that
i
have
done
all
i
can
but
they
are
all
mad
in
this
town
morten
kiil
you
said
yesterday
that
the
worst
of
this
pollution
came
from
my
tannery
if
that
is
true
then
my
grandfather
and
my
father
before
me
and
i
myself
for
many
years
past
have
been
poisoning
the
town
like
three
destroying
angels
do
you
think
i
am
going
to
sit
quiet
under
that
reproach
stockmann
unfortunately
i
am
afraid
you
will
have
to
morten
kiil
no
thank
you
i
am
jealous
of
my
name
and
reputation
they
call
me
the
badger
i
am
told
a
badger
is
a
kind
of
pig
i
believe
but
i
am
not
going
to
give
them
the
right
to
call
me
that
i
mean
to
live
and
die
a
clean
man
stockmann
and
how
are
you
going
to
set
about
it
morten
kiil
you
shall
cleanse
me
thomas
stockmann
i
morten
kiil
do
you
know
what
money
i
have
bought
these
shares
with
no
of
course
you
ca
know
but
i
will
tell
you
it
is
the
money
that
katherine
and
petra
and
the
boys
will
have
when
i
am
gone
because
i
have
been
able
to
save
a
little
bit
after
all
you
know
stockmann
flaring
up
and
you
have
gone
and
taken
money
for
this
morten
kiil
yes
the
whole
of
the
money
is
invested
in
the
baths
now
and
now
i
just
want
to
see
whether
you
are
quite
stark
staring
mad
thomas
if
you
still
make
out
that
these
animals
and
other
nasty
things
of
that
sort
come
from
my
tannery
it
will
be
exactly
as
if
you
were
to
flay
broad
strips
of
skin
from
katherine
body
and
petra
and
the
boys
and
no
decent
man
would
do
that
unless
he
were
mad
stockmann
walking
up
and
down
yes
but
i
am
mad
i
am
mad
morten
kiil
you
can
not
be
so
absurdly
mad
as
all
that
when
it
is
a
question
of
your
wife
and
children
stockmann
standing
still
in
front
of
him
why
could
you
consult
me
about
it
before
you
went
and
bought
all
that
trash
morten
kiil
what
is
done
can
not
be
undone
stockmann
walks
about
uneasily
if
only
i
were
not
so
certain
about
it
but
i
am
absolutely
convinced
that
i
am
right
morten
kiil
weighing
the
in
his
hand
if
you
stick
to
your
mad
idea
this
wo
be
worth
much
you
know
puts
the
in
his
pocket
stockmann
but
hang
it
all
it
might
be
possible
for
science
to
discover
some
prophylactic
i
should
think
or
some
antidote
of
some
kind
morten
kiil
to
kill
these
animals
do
you
mean
stockmann
yes
or
to
make
them
innocuous
morten
kiil
could
you
try
some
stockmann
do
talk
nonsense
they
all
say
it
is
only
imagination
you
know
well
let
it
go
at
that
let
them
have
their
own
way
about
it
have
the
ignorant
curs
reviled
me
as
an
enemy
of
the
people
and
have
they
been
ready
to
tear
the
clothes
off
my
back
too
morten
kiil
and
broken
all
your
windows
to
pieces
stockmann
and
then
there
is
my
duty
to
my
family
i
must
talk
it
over
with
katherine
she
is
great
on
those
things
morten
kiil
that
is
right
be
guided
by
a
reasonable
woman
advice
stockmann
advancing
towards
him
to
think
you
could
do
such
a
preposterous
thing
risking
katherine
money
in
this
way
and
putting
me
in
such
a
horribly
painful
dilemma
when
i
look
at
you
i
think
i
see
the
devil
himself
morten
kiil
then
i
had
better
go
but
i
must
have
an
answer
from
you
before
two
yes
or
no
if
it
is
no
the
shares
go
to
a
charity
and
that
this
very
day
stockmann
and
what
does
katherine
get
morten
kiil
not
a
halfpenny
the
door
leading
to
the
hall
opens
and
hovstad
and
aslaksen
make
their
appearance
look
at
those
two
stockmann
staring
at
them
what
the
devil
have
you
actually
the
face
to
come
into
my
house
hovstad
certainly
aslaksen
we
have
something
to
say
to
you
you
see
morten
kiil
in
a
whisper
yes
or
no
before
two
aslaksen
glancing
at
hovstad
aha
morten
kiil
goes
out
stockmann
well
what
do
you
want
with
me
be
brief
hovstad
i
can
quite
understand
that
you
are
annoyed
with
us
for
our
attitude
at
the
meeting
yesterday
stockmann
attitude
do
you
call
it
yes
it
was
a
charming
attitude
i
call
it
weak
womanish
damnably
shameful
hovstad
call
it
what
you
like
we
could
not
do
otherwise
stockmann
you
dared
not
do
otherwise
is
that
it
hovstad
well
if
you
like
to
put
it
that
way
aslaksen
but
why
did
you
not
let
us
have
word
of
it
beforehand
just
a
hint
to
hovstad
or
to
me
stockmann
a
hint
of
what
aslaksen
of
what
was
behind
it
all
stockmann
i
do
understand
you
in
the
least
aslaksen
with
a
confidential
nod
oh
yes
you
do
stockmann
hovstad
it
is
no
good
making
a
mystery
of
it
any
longer
stockmann
looking
first
at
one
of
them
and
then
at
the
other
what
the
devil
do
you
both
mean
aslaksen
may
i
ask
if
your
is
not
going
round
the
town
buying
up
all
the
shares
in
the
baths
stockmann
yes
he
has
been
buying
baths
shares
today
but
aslaksen
it
would
have
been
more
prudent
to
get
someone
else
to
do
it
someone
less
nearly
related
to
you
hovstad
and
you
should
not
have
let
your
name
appear
in
the
affair
there
was
no
need
for
anyone
to
know
that
the
attack
on
the
baths
came
from
you
you
ought
to
have
consulted
me
stockmann
stockmann
looks
in
front
of
him
then
a
light
seems
to
dawn
on
him
and
he
says
in
amazement
are
such
things
conceivable
are
such
things
possible
aslaksen
with
a
smile
evidently
they
are
but
it
is
better
to
use
a
little
finesse
you
know
hovstad
and
it
is
much
better
to
have
several
persons
in
a
thing
of
that
sort
because
the
responsibility
of
each
individual
is
lessened
when
there
are
others
with
him
stockmann
composedly
come
to
the
point
gentlemen
what
do
you
want
aslaksen
perhaps
hovstad
had
better
hovstad
no
you
tell
him
aslaksen
aslaksen
well
the
fact
is
that
now
we
know
the
bearings
of
the
whole
affair
we
think
we
might
venture
to
put
the
people
messenger
at
your
disposal
stockmann
do
you
dare
do
that
now
what
about
public
opinion
are
you
not
afraid
of
a
storm
breaking
upon
our
heads
hovstad
we
will
try
to
weather
it
aslaksen
and
you
must
be
ready
to
go
off
quickly
on
a
new
tack
doctor
as
soon
as
your
invective
has
done
its
work
stockmann
do
you
mean
as
soon
as
my
and
i
have
got
hold
of
the
shares
at
a
low
figure
hovstad
your
reasons
for
wishing
to
get
the
control
of
the
baths
are
mainly
scientific
i
take
it
stockmann
of
course
it
was
for
scientific
reasons
that
i
persuaded
the
old
badger
to
stand
in
with
me
in
the
matter
so
we
will
tinker
at
the
a
little
and
dig
up
a
little
bit
of
the
shore
and
it
sha
cost
the
town
a
sixpence
that
will
be
all
right
eh
hovstad
i
think
so
if
you
have
the
people
messenger
behind
you
aslaksen
the
press
is
a
power
in
a
free
community
doctor
stockmann
quite
so
and
so
is
public
opinion
and
you
aslaksen
i
suppose
you
will
be
answerable
for
the
association
aslaksen
yes
and
for
the
temperance
society
you
may
rely
on
that
stockmann
but
gentlemen
i
really
am
ashamed
to
ask
the
question
but
what
return
do
you
hovstad
we
should
prefer
to
help
you
without
any
return
whatever
believe
me
but
the
people
messenger
is
in
rather
a
shaky
condition
it
does
go
really
well
and
i
should
be
very
unwilling
to
suspend
the
paper
now
when
there
is
so
much
work
to
do
here
in
the
political
way
stockmann
quite
so
that
would
be
a
great
trial
to
such
a
friend
of
the
people
as
you
are
flares
up
but
i
am
an
enemy
of
the
people
remember
walks
about
the
room
where
have
i
put
my
stick
where
the
devil
is
my
stick
hovstad
what
that
aslaksen
surely
you
never
mean
stockmann
standing
still
and
suppose
i
do
give
you
a
single
penny
of
all
i
get
out
of
it
money
is
not
very
easy
to
get
out
of
us
rich
folk
please
to
remember
hovstad
and
you
please
to
remember
that
this
affair
of
the
shares
can
be
represented
in
two
ways
stockmann
yes
and
you
are
just
the
man
to
do
it
if
i
do
come
to
the
rescue
of
the
people
messenger
you
will
certainly
take
an
evil
view
of
the
affair
you
will
hunt
me
down
i
can
well
imagine
pursue
me
try
to
throttle
me
as
a
dog
does
a
hare
hovstad
it
is
a
natural
law
every
animal
must
fight
for
its
own
livelihood
aslaksen
and
get
its
food
where
it
can
you
know
stockmann
walking
about
the
room
then
you
go
and
look
for
yours
in
the
gutter
because
i
am
going
to
show
you
which
is
the
strongest
animal
of
us
three
finds
an
umbrella
and
brandishes
it
above
his
head
ah
now
hovstad
you
are
surely

devil

pen

point

katherine
petra
stay
here
stockmann
here
in
the
town
stockmann
yes
here
this
is
the
field
of
battle
this
is
where
the
fight
will
be
this
is
where
i
shall
triumph
as
soon
as
i
have
had
my
trousers
sewn
up
i
shall
go
out
and
look
for
another
house
we
must
have
a
roof
over
our
heads
for
the
winter
horster
that
you
shall
have
in
my
house
stockmann
can
i
horsier
yes
quite
well
i
have
plenty
of
room
and
i
am
almost
never
at
home
stockmann
how
good
of
you
captain
horster
petra
thank
you
stockmann
grasping
his
hand
thank
you
thank
you
that
is
one
trouble
over
now
i
can
set
to
work
in
earnest
at
once
there
is
an
endless
amount
of
things
to
look
through
here
katherine
luckily
i
shall
have
all
my
time
at
my
disposal
because
i
have
been
dismissed
from
the
baths
you
know
stockmann
with
a
sigh
oh
yes
i
expected
that
stockmann
and
they
want
to
take
my
practice
away
from
me
too
let
them
i
have
got
the
poor
people
to
fall
back
upon
anyway
those
that
do
pay
anything
and
after
all
they
need
me
most
too
but
by
jove
they
will
have
to
listen
to
me
i
shall
preach
to
them
in
season
and
out
of
season
as
it
says
somewhere
stockmann
but
dear
thomas
i
should
have
thought
events
had
showed
you
what
use
it
is
to
preach
stockmann
you
are
really
ridiculous
katherine
do
you
want
me
to
let
myself
be
beaten
off
the
field
by
public
opinion
and
the
compact
majority
and
all
that
devilry
no
thank
you
and
what
i
want
to
do
is
so
simple
and
clear
and
straightforward
i
only
want
to
drum
into
the
heads
of
these
curs
the
fact
that
the
liberals
are
the
most
insidious
enemies
of
freedom
that
party
programmes
strangle
every
young
and
vigorous
truth
that
considerations
of
expediency
turn
morality
and
justice
upside
down
and
that
they
will
end
by
making
life
here
unbearable
do
you
think
captain
horster
that
i
ought
to
be
able
to
make
people
understand
that
horster
very
likely
i
do
know
much
about
such
things
myself
stockmann
well
look
here
i
will
explain
it
is
the
party
leaders
that
must
be
exterminated
a
party
leader
is
like
a
wolf
you
see
like
a
voracious
wolf
he
requires
a
certain
number
of
smaller
victims
to
prey
upon
every
year
if
he
is
to
live
just
look
at
hovstad
and
aslaksen
how
many
smaller
victims
have
they
not
put
an
end
to
or
at
any
rate
maimed
and
mangled
until
they
are
fit
for
nothing
except
to
be
householders
or
subscribers
to
the
people
messenger
sits
down
on
the
edge
of
the
table
come
here
katherine
look
how
beautifully
the
sun
shines
and
this
lovely
spring
air
i
am
drinking
in
stockmann
yes
if
only
we
could
live
on
sunshine
and
spring
air
thomas
stockmann
oh
you
will
have
to
pinch
and
save
a
bit
then
we
shall
get
along
that
gives
me
very
little
concern
what
is
much
worse
is
that
i
know
of
no
one
who
is
and
enough
to
venture
to
take
up
my
work
after
me
petra
do
think
about
that
father
you
have
plenty
of
time
before
hello
here
are
the
boys
already
ejlif
and
morten
come
in
from
the
stockmann
have
you
got
a
holiday
morten

but
we
were
fighting
with
the
other
boys
between
lessons
ejlif
that
is
true
it
was
the
other
boys
were
fighting
with
us
morten
well
and
then
rorlund
said
we
had
better
stay
at
home
for
a
day
or
two
stockmann
snapping
his
fingers
and
getting
up
from
the
table
i
have
it
i
have
it
by
jove
you
shall
never
set
foot
in
the
school
again
the
boys
no
more
school
stockmann
but
thomas
stockmann
never
i
say
i
will
educate
you
myself
that
is
to
say
you
sha
learn
a
blessed
thing
morten
hooray
stockmann
but
i
will
make
and
men
of
you
you
must
help
me
with
that
petra
petra
yes
father
you
may
be
sure
i
will
stockmann
and
my
school
shall
be
in
the
room
where
they
insulted
me
and
called
me
an
enemy
of
the
people
but
we
are
too
few
as
we
are
i
must
have
at
least
twelve
boys
to
begin
with
stockmann
you
will
certainly
never
get
them
in
this
town
stockmann
we
shall
to
the
boys
do
you
know
any
street
urchins
regular
ragamuffins
morten
yes
father
i
know
lots
stockmann
that
capital
bring
me
some
specimens
of
them
i
am
going
to
experiment
with
curs
just
for
once
there
may
be
some
exceptional
heads
among
them
morten
and
what
are
we
going
to
do
when
you
have
made
and
men
of
us
stockmann
then
you
shall
drive
all
the
wolves
out
of
the
country
my
boys
ejlif
looks
rather
doubtful
about
it
morten
jumps
about
crying
hurrah
stockmann
let
us
hope
it
wo
be
the
wolves
that
will
drive
you
out
of
the
country
thomas
stockmann
are
you
out
of
your
mind
katherine
drive
me
out
now
when
i
am
the
strongest
man
in
the
town
stockmann
the
strongest
now
stockmann
yes
and
i
will
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
now
i
am
the
strongest
man
in
the
whole
world
morten
i
say
stockmann
lowering
his
voice
hush
you
must
say
anything
about
it
yet
but
i
have
made
a
great
discovery
stockmann
another
one
stockmann
yes
gathers
them
round
him
and
says
confidentially
it
is
this
let
me
tell
you
that
the
strongest
man
in
the
world
is
he
who
stands
most
alone
stockmann
smiling
and
shaking
her
head
oh
thomas
thomas
petra
encouragingly
as
she
grasps
her
father
hands
father
