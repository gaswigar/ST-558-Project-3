bimala
story
i
mother
today
there
comes
back
to
mind
the
vermilion
mark
at
the
parting
of
your
hair
the
which
you
used
to
wear
with
its
wide
red
border
and
those
wonderful
eyes
of
yours
full
of
depth
and
peace
they
came
at
the
start
of
my
life
journey
like
the
first
streak
of
dawn
giving
me
golden
provision
to
carry
me
on
my
way
the
sky
which
gives
light
is
blue
and
my
mother
face
was
dark
but
she
had
the
radiance
of
holiness
and
her
beauty
would
put
to
shame
all
the
vanity
of
the
beautiful
everyone
says
that
i
resemble
my
mother
in
my
childhood
i
used
to
resent
this
it
made
me
angry
with
my
mirror
i
thought
that
it
was
god
unfairness
which
was
wrapped
round
my
limbs
that
my
dark
features
were
not
my
due
but
had
come
to
me
by
some
misunderstanding
all
that
remained
for
me
to
ask
of
my
god
in
reparation
was
that
i
might
grow
up
to
be
a
model
of
what
woman
should
be
as
one
reads
it
in
some
epic
poem
when
the
proposal
came
for
my
marriage
an
astrologer
was
sent
who
consulted
my
palm
and
said
this
girl
has
good
signs
she
will
become
an
ideal
wife
and
all
the
women
who
heard
it
said
no
wonder
for
she
resembles
her
mother
i
was
married
into
a
rajah
house
when
i
was
a
child
i
was
quite
familiar
with
the
description
of
the
prince
of
the
fairy
story
but
my
husband
face
was
not
of
a
kind
that
imagination
would
place
in
fairyland
it
was
dark
even
as
mine
was
the
feeling
of
shrinking
which
i
had
about
my
own
lack
of
physical
beauty
was
lifted
a
little
at
the
same
time
a
touch
of
regret
was
left
lingering
in
my
heart
but
when
the
physical
appearance
evades
the
scrutiny
of
our
senses
and
enters
the
sanctuary
of
our
hearts
then
it
can
forget
itself
i
know
from
my
childhood
experience
how
devotion
is
beauty
itself
in
its
inner
aspect
when
my
mother
arranged
the
different
fruits
carefully
peeled
by
her
own
loving
hands
on
the
white
stone
plate
and
gently
waved
her
fan
to
drive
away
the
flies
while
my
father
sat
down
to
his
meals
her
service
would
lose
itself
in
a
beauty
which
passed
beyond
outward
forms
even
in
my
infancy
i
could
feel
its
power
it
transcended
all
debates
or
doubts
or
calculations
it
was
pure
music
i
distinctly
remember
after
my
marriage
when
early
in
the
morning
i
would
cautiously
and
silently
get
up
and
take
the
dust
of
my
husband
feet
without
waking
him
how
at
such
moments
i
could
feel
the
vermilion
mark
upon
my
forehead
shining
out
like
the
morning
star
one
day
he
happened
to
awake
and
smiled
as
he
asked
me
what
is
that
bimala
what
you
doing
i
can
never
forget
the
shame
of
being
detected
by
him
he
might
possibly
have
thought
that
i
was
trying
to
earn
merit
secretly
but
no
no
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
merit
it
was
my
woman
heart
which
must
worship
in
order
to
love
my
house
was
old
in
dignity
from
the
days
of
the
some
of
its
manners
were
of
the
moguls
and
pathans
some
of
its
customs
of
manu
and
parashar
but
my
husband
was
absolutely
modern
he
was
the
first
of
the
house
to
go
through
a
college
course
and
take
his
degree
his
elder
brother
had
died
young
of
drink
and
had
left
no
children
my
husband
did
not
drink
and
was
not
given
to
dissipation
so
foreign
to
the
family
was
this
abstinence
that
to
many
it
hardly
seemed
decent
purity
they
imagined
was
only
becoming
in
those
on
whom
fortune
had
not
smiled
it
is
the
moon
which
has
room
for
stains
not
the
stars
my
husband
parents
had
died
long
ago
and
his
old
grandmother
was
mistress
of
the
house
my
husband
was
the
apple
of
her
eye
the
jewel
on
her
bosom
and
so
he
never
met
with
much
difficulty
in
overstepping
any
of
the
ancient
usages
when
he
brought
in
miss
gilby
to
teach
me
and
be
my
companion
he
stuck
to
his
resolve
in
spite
of
the
poison
secreted
by
all
the
wagging
tongues
at
home
and
outside
my
husband
had
then
just
got
through
his
examination
and
was
reading
for
his
degree
so
he
had
to
stay
in
calcutta
to
attend
college
he
used
to
write
to
me
almost
every
day
a
few
lines
only
and
simple
words
but
his
bold
round
handwriting
would
look
up
into
my
face
oh
so
tenderly
i
kept
his
letters
in
a
sandalwood
box
and
covered
them
every
day
with
the
flowers
i
gathered
in
the
garden
at
that
time
the
prince
of
the
fairy
tale
had
faded
like
the
moon
in
the
morning
light
i
had
the
prince
of
my
real
world
enthroned
in
my
heart
i
was
his
queen
i
had
my
seat
by
his
side
but
my
real
joy
was
that
my
true
place
was
at
his
feet
since
then
i
have
been
educated
and
introduced
to
the
modern
age
in
its
own
language
and
therefore
these
words
that
i
write
seem
to
blush
with
shame
in
their
prose
setting
except
for
my
acquaintance
with
this
modern
standard
of
life
i
should
know
quite
naturally
that
just
as
my
being
born
a
woman
was
not
in
my
own
hands
so
the
element
of
devotion
in
woman
love
is
not
like
a
hackneyed
passage
quoted
from
a
romantic
poem
to
be
piously
written
down
in
round
hand
in
a
but
my
husband
would
not
give
me
any
opportunity
for
worship
that
was
his
greatness
they
are
cowards
who
claim
absolute
devotion
from
their
wives
as
their
right
that
is
a
humiliation
for
both
his
love
for
me
seemed
to
overflow
my
limits
by
its
flood
of
wealth
and
service
but
my
necessity
was
more
for
giving
than
for
receiving
for
love
is
a
vagabond
who
can
make
his
flowers
bloom
in
the
wayside
dust
better
than
in
the
crystal
jars
kept
in
the
my
husband
could
not
break
completely
with
the
traditions
which
prevailed
in
our
family
it
was
difficult
therefore
for
us
to
meet
at
any
hour
of
the
day
we
pleased
i
knew
exactly
the
time
that
he
could
come
to
me
and
therefore
our
meeting
had
all
the
care
of
loving
preparation
it
was
like
the
rhyming
of
a
poem
it
had
to
come
through
the
path
of
the
metre
after
finishing
the
day
work
and
taking
my
afternoon
bath
i
would
do
up
my
hair
and
renew
my
vermilion
mark
and
put
on
my
carefully
crinkled
and
then
bringing
back
my
body
and
mind
from
all
distractions
of
household
duties
i
would
dedicate
it
at
this
special
hour
with
special
ceremonies
to
one
individual
that
time
each
day
with
him
was
short
but
it
was
infinite
my
husband
used
to
say
that
man
and
wife
are
equal
in
love
because
of
their
equal
claim
on
each
other
i
never
argued
the
point
with
him
but
my
heart
said
that
devotion
never
stands
in
the
way
of
true
equality
it
only
raises
the
level
of
the
ground
of
meeting
therefore
the
joy
of
the
higher
equality
remains
permanent
it
never
slides
down
to
the
vulgar
level
of
triviality
my
beloved
it
was
worthy
of
you
that
you
never
expected
worship
from
me
but
if
you
had
accepted
it
you
would
have
done
me
a
real
service
you
showed
your
love
by
decorating
me
by
educating
me
by
giving
me
what
i
asked
for
and
what
i
did
not
i
have
seen
what
depth
of
love
there
was
in
your
eyes
when
you
gazed
at
me
i
have
known
the
secret
sigh
of
pain
you
suppressed
in
your
love
for
me
you
loved
my
body
as
if
it
were
a
flower
of
paradise
you
loved
my
whole
nature
as
if
it
had
been
given
you
by
some
rare
providence
such
lavish
devotion
made
me
proud
to
think
that
the
wealth
was
all
my
own
which
drove
you
to
my
gate
but
vanity
such
as
this
only
checks
the
flow
of
free
surrender
in
a
woman
love
when
i
sit
on
the
queen
throne
and
claim
homage
then
the
claim
only
goes
on
magnifying
itself
it
is
never
satisfied
can
there
be
any
real
happiness
for
a
woman
in
merely
feeling
that
she
has
power
over
a
man
to
surrender
one
pride
in
devotion
is
woman
only
salvation
it
comes
back
to
me
today
how
in
the
days
of
our
happiness
the
fires
of
envy
sprung
up
all
around
us
that
was
only
natural
for
had
i
not
stepped
into
my
good
fortune
by
a
mere
chance
and
without
deserving
it
but
providence
does
not
allow
a
run
of
luck
to
last
for
ever
unless
its
debt
of
honour
be
fully
paid
day
by
day
through
many
a
long
day
and
thus
made
secure
god
may
grant
us
gifts
but
the
merit
of
being
able
to
take
and
hold
them
must
be
our
own
alas
for
the
boons
that
slip
through
unworthy
hands
my
husband
grandmother
and
mother
were
both
renowned
for
their
beauty
and
my
widowed
was
also
of
a
beauty
rarely
to
be
seen
when
in
turn
fate
left
them
desolate
the
grandmother
vowed
she
would
not
insist
on
having
beauty
for
her
remaining
grandson
when
he
married
only
the
auspicious
marks
with
which
i
was
endowed
gained
me
an
entry
into
this
family
otherwise
i
had
no
claim
to
be
here
in
this
house
of
luxury
but
few
of
its
ladies
had
received
their
meed
of
respect
they
had
however
got
used
to
the
ways
of
the
family
and
managed
to
keep
their
heads
above
water
buoyed
up
by
their
dignity
as
of
an
ancient
house
in
spite
of
their
daily
tears
being
drowned
in
the
foam
of
wine
and
by
the
tinkle
of
the
dancing
girls
anklets
was
the
credit
due
to
me
that
my
husband
did
not
touch
liquor
nor
squander
his
manhood
in
the
markets
of
woman
flesh
what
charm
did
i
know
to
soothe
the
wild
and
wandering
mind
of
men
it
was
my
good
luck
nothing
else
for
fate
proved
utterly
callous
to
my
her
festivity
died
out
while
yet
the
evening
was
early
leaving
the
light
of
her
beauty
shining
in
vain
over
empty
halls
burning
and
burning
with
no
accompanying
music
his
affected
a
contempt
for
my
husband
modern
notions
how
absurd
to
keep
the
family
ship
laden
with
all
the
weight
of
its
glory
sailing
under
the
colours
of
his
slip
of
a
alone
often
have
i
felt
the
lash
of
scorn
a
thief
who
had
stolen
a
husband
love
a
sham
hidden
in
the
shamelessness
of
her
finery
the
garments
of
modern
fashion
with
which
my
husband
loved
to
adorn
me
roused
jealous
wrath
is
not
she
ashamed
to
make
a
of
herself
and
with
her
looks
too
my
husband
was
aware
of
all
this
but
his
gentleness
knew
no
bounds
he
used
to
implore
me
to
forgive
her
i
remember
i
once
told
him
women
minds
are
so
petty
so
crooked
like
the
feet
of
chinese
women
he
replied
has
not
the
pressure
of
society
cramped
them
into
pettiness
and
crookedness
they
are
but
pawns
of
the
fate
which
gambles
with
them
what
responsibility
have
they
of
their
own
my
never
failed
to
get
from
my
husband
whatever
she
wanted
he
did
not
stop
to
consider
whether
her
requests
were
right
or
reasonable
but
what
exasperated
me
most
was
that
she
was
not
grateful
for
this
i
had
promised
my
husband
that
i
would
not
talk
back
at
her
but
this
set
me
raging
all
the
more
inwardly
i
used
to
feel
that
goodness
has
a
limit
which
if
passed
somehow
seems
to
make
men
cowardly
shall
i
tell
the
whole
truth
i
have
often
wished
that
my
husband
had
the
manliness
to
be
a
little
less
good
my
the
bara
rani
was
still
young
and
had
no
pretensions
to
saintliness
rather
her
talk
and
jest
and
laugh
inclined
to
be
forward
the
young
maids
with
whom
she
surrounded
herself
were
also
impudent
to
a
degree
but
there
was
none
to
gainsay
her
for
was
not
this
the
custom
of
the
house
it
seemed
to
me
that
my
good
fortune
in
having
a
stainless
husband
was
a
special
eyesore
to
her
he
however
felt
more
the
sorrow
of
her
lot
than
the
defects
of
her
character
the
mark
of
hindu
wifehood
and
the
symbol
of
all
the
devotion
that
it
implies
the
is
the
dress
of
the
hindu
woman
taking
the
dust
of
the
feet
is
a
formal
offering
of
reverence
and
is
done
by
lightly
touching
the
feet
of
the
revered
one
and
then
one
own
head
with
the
same
hand
the
wife
does
not
ordinarily
do
this
to
the
husband
it
would
not
be
reckoned
good
form
for
the
husband
to
be
continually
going
into
the
zenana
except
at
particular
hours
for
meals
or
rest
senior
junior
in
joint
families
of
rank
though
the
widows
remain
entitled
only
to
a
in
their
husbands
share
their
rank
remains
to
them
according
to
seniority
and
the
titles
senior
and
junior
continue
to
distinguish
the
elder
and
younger
branches
even
though
the
junior
branch
be
the
one
in
power
ii
my
husband
was
very
eager
to
take
me
out
of
one
day
i
said
to
him
what
do
i
want
with
the
outside
world
the
outside
world
may
want
you
he
replied
if
the
outside
world
has
got
on
so
long
without
me
it
may
go
on
for
some
time
longer
it
need
not
pine
to
death
for
want
of
me
let
it
perish
for
all
i
care
that
is
not
troubling
me
i
am
thinking
about
myself
oh
indeed
tell
me
what
about
yourself
my
husband
was
silent
with
a
smile
i
knew
his
way
and
protested
at
once
no
no
you
are
not
going
to
run
away
from
me
like
that
i
want
to
have
this
out
with
you
can
one
ever
finish
a
subject
with
words
do
stop
speaking
in
riddles
tell
me
what
i
want
is
that
i
should
have
you
and
you
should
have
me
more
fully
in
the
outside
world
that
is
where
we
are
still
in
debt
to
each
other
is
anything
wanting
then
in
the
love
we
have
here
at
home
here
you
are
wrapped
up
in
me
you
know
neither
what
you
have
nor
what
you
want
i
can
not
bear
to
hear
you
talk
like
this
i
would
have
you
come
into
the
heart
of
the
outer
world
and
meet
reality
merely
going
on
with
your
household
duties
living
all
your
life
in
the
world
of
household
conventions
and
the
drudgery
of
household
tasks
you
were
not
made
for
that
if
we
meet
and
recognize
each
other
in
the
real
world
then
only
will
our
love
be
true
if
there
be
any
drawback
here
to
our
full
recognition
of
each
other
then
i
have
nothing
to
say
but
as
for
myself
i
feel
no
want
well
even
if
the
drawback
is
only
on
my
side
why
should
you
help
to
remove
it
such
discussions
repeatedly
occurred
one
day
he
said
the
greedy
man
who
is
fond
of
his
fish
stew
has
no
compunction
in
cutting
up
the
fish
according
to
his
need
but
the
man
who
loves
the
fish
wants
to
enjoy
it
in
the
water
and
if
that
is
impossible
he
waits
on
the
bank
and
even
if
he
comes
back
home
without
a
sight
of
it
he
has
the
consolation
of
knowing
that
the
fish
is
all
right
perfect
gain
is
the
best
of
all
but
if
that
is
impossible
then
the
next
best
gain
is
perfect
losing
i
never
liked
the
way
my
husband
had
of
talking
on
this
subject
but
that
is
not
the
reason
why
i
refused
to
leave
the
zenana
his
grandmother
was
still
alive
my
husband
had
filled
more
than
a
hundred
and
twenty
per
cent
of
the
house
with
the
twentieth
century
against
her
taste
but
she
had
borne
it
uncomplaining
she
would
have
borne
it
likewise
if
the
of
the
rajah
house
had
left
its
seclusion
she
was
even
prepared
for
this
happening
but
i
did
not
consider
it
important
enough
to
give
her
the
pain
of
it
i
have
read
in
books
that
we
are
called
caged
birds
i
can
not
speak
for
others
but
i
had
so
much
in
this
cage
of
mine
that
there
was
not
room
for
it
in
the
universe
at
least
that
is
what
i
then
felt
the
grandmother
in
her
old
age
was
very
fond
of
me
at
the
bottom
of
her
fondness
was
the
thought
that
with
the
conspiracy
of
favourable
stars
which
attended
me
i
had
been
able
to
attract
my
husband
love
were
not
men
naturally
inclined
to
plunge
downwards
none
of
the
others
for
all
their
beauty
had
been
able
to
prevent
their
husbands
going
headlong
into
the
burning
depths
which
consumed
and
destroyed
them
she
believed
that
i
had
been
the
means
of
extinguishing
this
fire
so
deadly
to
the
men
of
the
family
so
she
kept
me
in
the
shelter
of
her
bosom
and
trembled
if
i
was
in
the
least
bit
unwell
his
grandmother
did
not
like
the
dresses
and
ornaments
my
husband
brought
from
european
shops
to
deck
me
with
but
she
reflected
men
will
have
some
absurd
hobby
or
other
which
is
sure
to
be
expensive
it
is
no
use
trying
to
check
their
extravagance
one
is
glad
enough
if
they
stop
short
of
ruin
if
my
nikhil
had
not
been
busy
dressing
up
his
wife
there
is
no
knowing
whom
else
he
might
have
spent
his
money
on
so
whenever
any
new
dress
of
mine
arrived
she
used
to
send
for
my
husband
and
make
merry
over
it
thus
it
came
about
that
it
was
her
taste
which
changed
the
influence
of
the
modern
age
fell
so
strongly
upon
her
that
her
evenings
refused
to
pass
if
i
did
not
tell
her
stories
out
of
english
books
after
his
grandmother
death
my
husband
wanted
me
to
go
and
live
with
him
in
calcutta
but
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
do
that
was
not
this
our
house
which
she
had
kept
under
her
sheltering
care
through
all
her
trials
and
troubles
would
not
a
curse
come
upon
me
if
i
deserted
it
and
went
off
to
town
this
was
the
thought
that
kept
me
back
as
her
empty
seat
reproachfully
looked
up
at
me
that
noble
lady
had
come
into
this
house
at
the
age
of
eight
and
had
died
in
her
year
she
had
not
spent
a
happy
life
fate
had
hurled
shaft
after
shaft
at
her
breast
only
to
draw
out
more
and
more
the
imperishable
spirit
within
this
great
house
was
hallowed
with
her
tears
what
should
i
do
in
the
dust
of
calcutta
away
from
it
my
husband
idea
was
that
this
would
be
a
good
opportunity
for
leaving
to
my
the
consolation
of
ruling
over
the
household
giving
our
life
at
the
same
time
more
room
to
branch
out
in
calcutta
that
is
just
where
my
difficulty
came
in
she
had
worried
my
life
out
she
ill
brooked
my
husband
happiness
and
for
this
she
was
to
be
rewarded
and
what
of
the
day
when
we
should
have
to
come
back
here
should
i
then
get
back
my
seat
at
the
head
what
do
you
want
with
that
seat
my
husband
would
say
are
there
not
more
precious
things
in
life
men
never
understand
these
things
they
have
their
nests
in
the
outside
world
they
little
know
the
whole
of
what
the
household
stands
for
in
these
matters
they
ought
to
follow
womanly
guidance
such
were
my
thoughts
at
that
time
i
felt
the
real
point
was
that
one
ought
to
stand
up
for
rights
to
go
away
and
leave
everything
in
the
hands
of
the
enemy
would
be
nothing
short
of
owning
defeat
but
why
did
not
my
husband
compel
me
to
go
with
him
to
calcutta
i
know
the
reason
he
did
not
use
his
power
just
because
he
had
it
the
seclusion
of
the
zenana
and
all
the
customs
peculiar
to
it
are
designated
by
the
general
term
purdah
which
means
screen
the
prestige
of
the
is
of
the
first
importance
in
a
hindu
household
of
rank
iii
if
one
had
to
fill
in
little
by
little
the
gap
between
day
and
night
it
would
take
an
eternity
to
do
it
but
the
sun
rises
and
the
darkness
is
dispelled
a
moment
is
sufficient
to
overcome
an
infinite
distance
one
day
there
came
the
new
era
of
in
bengal
but
as
to
how
it
happened
we
had
no
distinct
vision
there
was
no
gradual
slope
connecting
the
past
with
the
present
for
that
reason
i
imagine
the
new
epoch
came
in
like
a
flood
breaking
down
the
dykes
and
sweeping
all
our
prudence
and
fear
before
it
we
had
no
time
even
to
think
about
or
understand
what
had
happened
or
what
was
about
to
happen
my
sight
and
my
mind
my
hopes
and
my
desires
became
red
with
the
passion
of
this
new
age
though
up
to
this
time
the
walls
of
the
home
which
was
the
ultimate
world
to
my
mind
remained
unbroken
yet
i
stood
looking
over
into
the
distance
and
i
heard
a
voice
from
the
far
horizon
whose
meaning
was
not
perfectly
clear
to
me
but
whose
call
went
straight
to
my
heart
from
the
time
my
husband
had
been
a
college
student
he
had
been
trying
to
get
the
things
required
by
our
people
produced
in
our
own
country
there
are
plenty
of
date
trees
in
our
district
he
tried
to
invent
an
apparatus
for
extracting
the
juice
and
boiling
it
into
sugar
and
treacle
i
heard
that
it
was
a
great
success
only
it
extracted
more
money
than
juice
after
a
while
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
our
attempts
at
reviving
our
industries
were
not
succeeding
for
want
of
a
bank
of
our
own
he
was
at
the
time
trying
to
teach
me
political
economy
this
alone
would
not
have
done
much
harm
but
he
also
took
it
into
his
head
to
teach
his
countrymen
ideas
of
thrift
so
as
to
pave
the
way
for
a
bank
and
then
he
actually
started
a
small
bank
its
high
rate
of
interest
which
made
the
villagers
flock
so
enthusiastically
to
put
in
their
money
ended
by
swamping
the
bank
altogether
the
old
officers
of
the
estate
felt
troubled
and
frightened
there
was
jubilation
in
the
enemy
camp
of
all
the
family
only
my
husband
grandmother
remained
unmoved
she
would
scold
me
saying
why
are
you
all
plaguing
him
so
is
it
the
fate
of
the
estate
that
is
worrying
you
how
many
times
have
i
seen
this
estate
in
the
hands
of
the
court
receiver
are
men
like
women
men
are
born
spendthrifts
and
only
know
how
to
waste
look
here
child
count
yourself
fortunate
that
your
husband
is
not
wasting
himself
as
well
my
husband
list
of
charities
was
a
long
one
he
would
assist
to
the
bitter
end
of
utter
failure
anyone
who
wanted
to
invent
a
new
loom
or
machine
but
what
annoyed
me
most
was
the
way
that
sandip
babu
used
to
fleece
him
on
the
pretext
of
work
whenever
he
wanted
to
start
a
newspaper
or
travel
about
preaching
the
cause
or
take
a
change
of
air
by
the
advice
of
his
doctor
my
husband
would
unquestioningly
supply
him
with
the
money
this
was
over
and
above
the
regular
living
allowance
which
sandip
babu
also
received
from
him
the
strangest
part
of
it
was
that
my
husband
and
sandip
babu
did
not
agree
in
their
opinions
as
soon
as
the
storm
reached
my
blood
i
said
to
my
husband
i
must
burn
all
my
foreign
clothes
why
burn
them
said
he
you
need
not
wear
them
as
long
as
you
please
as
long
as
i
please
not
in
this
life
very
well
do
not
wear
them
for
the
rest
of
your
life
then
but
why
this
bonfire
business
would
you
thwart
me
in
my
resolve
what
i
want
to
say
is
this
why
not
try
to
build
up
something
you
should
not
waste
even
a
tenth
part
of
your
energies
in
this
destructive
excitement
such
excitement
will
give
us
the
energy
to
build
that
is
as
much
as
to
say
that
you
can
not
light
the
house
unless
you
set
fire
to
it
then
there
came
another
trouble
when
miss
gilby
first
came
to
our
house
there
was
a
great
flutter
which
afterwards
calmed
down
when
they
got
used
to
her
now
the
whole
thing
was
stirred
up
afresh
i
had
never
bothered
myself
before
as
to
whether
miss
gilby
was
european
or
indian
but
i
began
to
do
so
now
i
said
to
my
husband
we
must
get
rid
of
miss
gilby
he
kept
silent
i
talked
to
him
wildly
and
he
went
away
sad
at
heart
after
a
fit
of
weeping
i
felt
in
a
more
reasonable
mood
when
we
met
at
night
i
can
not
my
husband
said
look
upon
miss
gilby
through
a
mist
of
abstraction
just
because
she
is
english
can
not
you
get
over
the
barrier
of
her
name
after
such
a
long
acquaintance
can
not
you
realize
that
she
loves
you
i
felt
a
little
ashamed
and
replied
with
some
sharpness
let
her
remain
i
am
not
over
anxious
to
send
her
away
and
miss
gilby
remained
but
one
day
i
was
told
that
she
had
been
insulted
by
a
young
fellow
on
her
way
to
church
this
was
a
boy
whom
we
were
supporting
my
husband
turned
him
out
of
the
house
there
was
not
a
single
soul
that
day
who
could
forgive
my
husband
for
that
act
not
even
i
this
time
miss
gilby
left
of
her
own
accord
she
shed
tears
when
she
came
to
say
but
my
mood
would
not
melt
to
slander
the
poor
boy
so
and
such
a
fine
boy
too
who
would
forget
his
daily
bath
and
food
in
his
enthusiasm
for
my
husband
escorted
miss
gilby
to
the
railway
station
in
his
own
carriage
i
was
sure
he
was
going
too
far
when
exaggerated
accounts
of
the
incident
gave
rise
to
a
public
scandal
which
found
its
way
to
the
newspapers
i
felt
he
had
been
rightly
served
i
had
often
become
anxious
at
my
husband
doings
but
had
never
before
been
ashamed
yet
now
i
had
to
blush
for
him
i
did
not
know
exactly
nor
did
i
care
what
wrong
poor
noren
might
or
might
not
have
done
to
miss
gilby
but
the
idea
of
sitting
in
judgement
on
such
a
matter
at
such
a
time
i
should
have
refused
to
damp
the
spirit
which
prompted
young
noren
to
defy
the
englishwoman
i
could
not
but
look
upon
it
as
a
sign
of
cowardice
in
my
husband
that
he
should
fail
to
understand
this
simple
thing
and
so
i
blushed
for
him
and
yet
it
was
not
that
my
husband
refused
to
support
or
was
in
any
way
against
the
cause
only
he
had
not
been
able
to
accept
the
spirit
of
i
am
willing
he
said
to
serve
my
country
but
my
worship
i
reserve
for
right
which
is
far
greater
than
my
country
to
worship
my
country
as
a
god
is
to
bring
a
curse
upon
it
the
nationalist
movement
which
began
more
as
an
economic
than
a
political
one
having
as
its
main
object
the
encouragement
of
indigenous
industries
babu
is
a
term
of
respect
like
father
or
mister
but
has
also
meant
in
colonial
days
a
person
who
understands
some
english
ed
lit
hail
mother
the
opening
words
of
a
song
by
bankim
chatterjee
the
famous
bengali
novelist
the
song
has
now
become
the
national
anthem
and
the
national
cry
since
the
days
of
the
movement
chapter
two
bimala
story
iv
this
was
the
time
when
sandip
babu
with
his
followers
came
to
our
neighbourhood
to
preach
there
is
to
be
a
big
meeting
in
our
temple
pavilion
we
women
are
sitting
there
on
one
side
behind
a
screen
triumphant
shouts
of
come
nearer
and
to
them
i
am
thrilling
through
and
through
suddenly
a
stream
of
barefooted
youths
in
turbans
clad
in
ascetic
ochre
rushes
into
the
quadrangle
like
a
freshet
into
a
dry
at
the
first
burst
of
the
rains
the
whole
place
is
filled
with
an
immense
crowd
through
which
sandip
babu
is
borne
seated
in
a
big
chair
hoisted
on
the
shoulders
of
ten
or
twelve
of
the
youths
mataram
bande
mataram
bande
it
seems
as
though
the
skies
would
be
rent
and
scattered
into
a
thousand
fragments
i
had
seen
sandip
babu
photograph
before
there
was
something
in
his
features
which
i
did
not
quite
like
not
that
he
was
looking
far
from
it
he
had
a
splendidly
handsome
face
yet
i
know
not
why
it
seemed
to
me
in
spite
of
all
its
brilliance
that
too
much
of
base
alloy
had
gone
into
its
making
the
light
in
his
eyes
somehow
did
not
shine
true
that
was
why
i
did
not
like
it
when
my
husband
unquestioningly
gave
in
to
all
his
demands
i
could
bear
the
waste
of
money
but
it
vexed
me
to
think
that
he
was
imposing
on
my
husband
taking
advantage
of
friendship
his
bearing
was
not
that
of
an
ascetic
nor
even
of
a
person
of
moderate
means
but
foppish
all
over
love
of
comfort
seemed
to
any
number
of
such
reflections
come
back
to
me
today
but
let
them
be
when
however
sandip
babu
began
to
speak
that
afternoon
and
the
hearts
of
the
crowd
swayed
and
surged
to
his
words
as
though
they
would
break
all
bounds
i
saw
him
wonderfully
transformed
especially
when
his
features
were
suddenly
lit
up
by
a
shaft
of
light
from
the
slowly
setting
sun
as
it
sunk
below
the
of
the
pavilion
he
seemed
to
me
to
be
marked
out
by
the
gods
as
their
messenger
to
mortal
men
and
women
from
beginning
to
end
of
his
speech
each
one
of
his
utterances
was
a
stormy
outburst
there
was
no
limit
to
the
confidence
of
his
assurance
i
do
not
know
how
it
happened
but
i
found
i
had
impatiently
pushed
away
the
screen
from
before
me
and
had
fixed
my
gaze
upon
him
yet
there
was
none
in
that
crowd
who
paid
any
heed
to
my
doings
only
once
i
noticed
his
eyes
like
stars
in
fateful
orion
flashed
full
on
my
face
i
was
utterly
unconscious
of
myself
i
was
no
longer
the
lady
of
the
rajah
house
but
the
sole
representative
of
womanhood
and
he
was
the
champion
of
bengal
as
the
sky
had
shed
its
light
over
him
so
he
must
receive
the
consecration
of
a
woman
benediction
it
seemed
clear
to
me
that
since
he
had
caught
sight
of
me
the
fire
in
his
words
had
flamed
up
more
fiercely
indra
steed
refused
to
be
reined
in
and
there
came
the
roar
of
thunder
and
the
flash
of
lightning
i
said
within
myself
that
his
language
had
caught
fire
from
my
eyes
for
we
women
are
not
only
the
deities
of
the
household
fire
but
the
flame
of
the
soul
itself
i
returned
home
that
evening
radiant
with
a
new
pride
and
joy
the
storm
within
me
had
shifted
my
whole
being
from
one
centre
to
another
like
the
greek
maidens
of
old
i
fain
would
cut
off
my
long
resplendent
tresses
to
make
a
bowstring
for
my
hero
had
my
outward
ornaments
been
connected
with
my
inner
feelings
then
my
necklet
my
armlets
my
bracelets
would
all
have
burst
their
bonds
and
flung
themselves
over
that
assembly
like
a
shower
of
meteors
only
some
personal
sacrifice
i
felt
could
help
me
to
bear
the
tumult
of
my
exaltation
when
my
husband
came
home
later
i
was
trembling
lest
he
should
utter
a
sound
out
of
tune
with
the
triumphant
paean
which
was
still
ringing
in
my
ears
lest
his
fanaticism
for
truth
should
lead
him
to
express
disapproval
of
anything
that
had
been
said
that
afternoon
for
then
i
should
have
openly
defied
and
humiliated
him
but
he
did
not
say
a
word
which
i
did
not
like
either
he
should
have
said
sandip
has
brought
me
to
my
senses
i
now
realize
how
mistaken
i
have
been
all
this
time
i
somehow
felt
that
he
was
spitefully
silent
that
he
obstinately
refused
to
be
enthusiastic
i
asked
how
long
sandip
babu
was
going
to
be
with
us
he
is
off
to
rangpur
early
tomorrow
morning
said
my
husband
must
it
be
tomorrow
yes
he
is
already
engaged
to
speak
there
i
was
silent
for
a
while
and
then
asked
again
could
he
not
possibly
stay
a
day
longer
that
may
hardly
be
possible
but
why
i
want
to
invite
him
to
dinner
and
attend
on
him
myself
my
husband
was
surprised
he
had
often
entreated
me
to
be
present
when
he
had
particular
friends
to
dinner
but
i
had
never
let
myself
be
persuaded
he
gazed
at
me
curiously
in
silence
with
a
look
i
did
not
quite
understand
i
was
suddenly
overcome
with
a
sense
of
shame
no
no
i
exclaimed
that
would
never
do
why
not
said
he
i
will
ask
him
myself
and
if
it
is
at
all
possible
he
will
surely
stay
on
for
tomorrow
it
turned
out
to
be
quite
possible
i
will
tell
the
exact
truth
that
day
i
reproached
my
creator
because
he
had
not
made
me
surpassingly
beautiful
not
to
steal
any
heart
away
but
because
beauty
is
glory
in
this
great
day
the
men
of
the
country
should
realize
its
goddess
in
its
womanhood
but
alas
the
eyes
of
men
fail
to
discern
the
goddess
if
outward
beauty
be
lacking
would
sandip
babu
find
the
of
the
motherland
manifest
in
me
or
would
he
simply
take
me
to
be
an
ordinary
domestic
woman
that
morning
i
scented
my
flowing
hair
and
tied
it
in
a
loose
knot
bound
by
a
cunningly
intertwined
red
silk
ribbon
dinner
you
see
was
to
be
served
at
midday
and
there
was
no
time
to
dry
my
hair
after
my
bath
and
do
it
up
plaited
in
the
ordinary
way
i
put
on
a
white
and
my
muslin
jacket
was
also
i
felt
that
there
was
a
certain
restraint
about
my
costume
and
that
nothing
could
well
have
been
simpler
but
my
who
happened
to
be
passing
by
stopped
dead
before
me
surveyed
me
from
head
to
foot
and
with
compressed
lips
smiled
a
meaning
smile
when
i
asked
her
the
reason
i
am
admiring
your
she
said
what
is
there
so
entertaining
about
it
i
enquired
considerably
annoyed
it
superb
she
said
i
was
only
thinking
that
one
of
those
english
bodices
would
have
made
it
perfect
not
only
her
mouth
and
eyes
but
her
whole
body
seemed
to
ripple
with
suppressed
laughter
as
she
left
the
room
i
was
very
very
angry
and
wanted
to
change
everything
and
put
on
my
everyday
clothes
but
i
can
not
tell
exactly
why
i
could
not
carry
out
my
impulse
women
are
the
ornaments
of
society
thus
i
reasoned
with
myself
and
my
husband
would
never
like
it
if
i
appeared
before
sandip
babu
unworthily
clad
my
idea
had
been
to
make
my
appearance
after
they
had
sat
down
to
dinner
in
the
bustle
of
looking
after
the
serving
the
first
awkwardness
would
have
passed
off
but
dinner
was
not
ready
in
time
and
it
was
getting
late
meanwhile
my
husband
had
sent
for
me
to
introduce
the
guest
i
was
feeling
horribly
shy
about
looking
sandip
babu
in
the
face
however
i
managed
to
recover
myself
enough
to
say
i
am
so
sorry
dinner
is
getting
late
he
boldly
came
and
sat
right
beside
me
as
he
replied
i
get
a
dinner
of
some
kind
every
day
but
the
goddess
of
plenty
keeps
behind
the
scenes
now
that
the
goddess
herself
has
appeared
it
matters
little
if
the
dinner
lags
behind
he
was
just
as
emphatic
in
his
manners
as
he
was
in
his
public
speaking
he
had
no
hesitation
and
seemed
to
be
accustomed
to
occupy
unchallenged
his
chosen
seat
he
claimed
the
right
to
intimacy
so
confidently
that
the
blame
would
seem
to
belong
to
those
who
should
dispute
it
i
was
in
terror
lest
sandip
babu
should
take
me
for
a
shrinking
bundle
of
inanity
but
for
the
life
of
me
i
could
not
sparkle
in
repartees
such
as
might
charm
or
dazzle
him
what
could
have
possessed
me
i
angrily
wondered
to
appear
before
him
in
such
an
absurd
way
i
was
about
to
retire
when
dinner
was
over
but
sandip
babu
as
bold
as
ever
placed
himself
in
my
way
you
must
not
he
said
think
me
greedy
it
was
not
the
dinner
that
kept
me
staying
on
it
was
your
invitation
if
you
were
to
run
away
now
that
would
not
be
playing
fair
with
your
guest
if
he
had
not
said
these
words
with
a
careless
ease
they
would
have
been
out
of
tune
but
after
all
he
was
such
a
great
friend
of
my
husband
that
i
was
like
his
sister
while
i
was
struggling
to
climb
up
this
high
wave
of
intimacy
my
husband
came
to
the
rescue
saying
why
not
come
back
to
us
after
you
have
taken
your
dinner
but
you
must
give
your
word
said
sandip
babu
before
we
let
you
off
i
will
come
said
i
with
a
slight
smile
let
me
tell
you
continued
sandip
babu
why
i
can
not
trust
you
nikhil
has
been
married
these
nine
years
and
all
this
while
you
have
eluded
me
if
you
do
this
again
for
another
nine
years
we
shall
never
meet
again
i
took
up
the
spirit
of
his
remark
as
i
dropped
my
voice
to
reply
why
even
then
should
we
not
meet
my
horoscope
tells
me
i
am
to
die
early
none
of
my
forefathers
have
survived
their
thirtieth
year
i
am
now
he
knew
this
would
go
home
this
time
there
must
have
been
a
shade
of
concern
in
my
low
voice
as
i
said
the
blessings
of
the
whole
country
are
sure
to
avert
the
evil
influence
of
the
stars
then
the
blessings
of
the
country
must
be
voiced
by
its
goddess
this
is
the
reason
for
my
anxiety
that
you
should
return
so
that
my
talisman
may
begin
to
work
from
today
sandip
babu
had
such
a
way
of
taking
things
by
storm
that
i
got
no
opportunity
of
resenting
what
i
never
should
have
permitted
in
another
so
he
concluded
with
a
laugh
i
am
going
to
hold
this
husband
of
yours
as
a
hostage
till
you
come
back
as
i
was
coming
away
he
exclaimed
may
i
trouble
you
for
a
trifle
i
started
and
turned
round
do
be
alarmed
he
said
it
merely
a
glass
of
water
you
might
have
noticed
that
i
did
not
drink
any
water
with
my
dinner
i
take
it
a
little
later
upon
this
i
had
to
make
a
show
of
interest
and
ask
him
the
reason
he
began
to
give
the
history
of
his
dyspepsia
i
was
told
how
he
had
been
a
martyr
to
it
for
seven
months
and
how
after
the
usual
course
of
nuisances
which
included
different
allopathic
and
homoeopathic
misadventures
he
had
obtained
the
most
wonderful
results
by
indigenous
methods
do
you
know
he
added
with
a
smile
god
has
built
even
my
infirmities
in
such
a
manner
that
they
yield
only
under
the
bombardment
of
pills
my
husband
at
this
broke
his
silence
you
must
confess
said
he
that
you
have
as
immense
an
attraction
for
foreign
medicine
as
the
earth
has
for
meteors
you
have
three
shelves
in
your
full
of
sandip
babu
broke
in
do
you
know
what
they
are
they
are
the
punitive
police
they
come
not
because
they
are
wanted
but
because
they
are
imposed
on
us
by
the
rule
of
this
modern
age
exacting
fines
injuries
my
husband
could
not
bear
exaggerations
and
i
could
see
he
disliked
this
but
all
ornaments
are
exaggerations
they
are
not
made
by
god
but
by
man
once
i
remember
in
defence
of
some
untruth
of
mine
i
said
to
my
husband
only
the
trees
and
beasts
and
birds
tell
unmitigated
truths
because
these
poor
things
have
not
the
power
to
invent
in
this
men
show
their
superiority
to
the
lower
creatures
and
women
beat
even
men
neither
is
a
profusion
of
ornament
unbecoming
for
a
woman
nor
a
profusion
of
untruth
as
i
came
out
into
the
passage
leading
to
the
zenana
i
found
my
standing
near
a
window
overlooking
the
reception
rooms
peeping
through
the
venetian
shutter
you
here
i
asked
in
surprise
eavesdropping
she
replied
the
jupiter
pluvius
of
hindu
mythology
v
when
i
returned
sandip
babu
was
tenderly
apologetic
i
am
afraid
we
have
spoilt
your
appetite
he
said
i
felt
greatly
ashamed
indeed
i
had
been
too
indecently
quick
over
my
dinner
with
a
little
calculation
it
would
become
quite
evident
that
my
had
surpassed
the
eating
but
i
had
no
idea
that
anyone
could
have
been
deliberately
calculating
i
suppose
sandip
babu
detected
my
feeling
of
shame
which
only
augmented
it
i
was
sure
he
said
that
you
had
the
impulse
of
the
wild
deer
to
run
away
but
it
is
a
great
boon
that
you
took
the
trouble
to
keep
your
promise
with
me
i
could
not
think
of
any
suitable
reply
and
so
i
sat
down
blushing
and
uncomfortable
at
one
end
of
the
sofa
the
vision
that
i
had
of
myself
as
the
of
womanhood
incarnate
crowning
sandip
babu
simply
with
my
presence
majestic
and
unashamed
failed
me
altogether
sandip
babu
deliberately
started
a
discussion
with
my
husband
he
knew
that
his
keen
wit
flashed
to
the
best
effect
in
an
argument
i
have
often
since
observed
that
he
never
lost
an
opportunity
for
a
passage
at
arms
whenever
i
happened
to
be
present
he
was
familiar
with
my
husband
views
on
the
cult
of
and
began
in
a
provoking
way
so
you
do
not
allow
that
there
is
room
for
an
appeal
to
the
imagination
in
patriotic
work
it
has
its
place
sandip
i
admit
but
i
do
not
believe
in
giving
it
the
whole
place
i
would
know
my
country
in
its
frank
reality
and
for
this
i
am
both
afraid
and
ashamed
to
make
use
of
hypnotic
texts
of
patriotism
what
you
call
hypnotic
texts
i
call
truth
i
truly
believe
my
country
to
be
my
god
i
worship
humanity
god
manifests
himself
both
in
man
and
in
his
country
if
that
is
what
you
really
believe
there
should
be
no
difference
for
you
between
man
and
man
and
so
between
country
and
country
quite
true
but
my
powers
are
limited
so
my
worship
of
humanity
is
continued
in
the
worship
of
my
country
i
have
nothing
against
your
worship
as
such
but
how
is
it
you
propose
to
conduct
your
worship
of
god
by
hating
other
countries
in
which
he
is
equally
manifest
hate
is
also
an
adjunct
of
worship
arjuna
won
favour
by
wrestling
with
him
god
will
be
with
us
in
the
end
if
we
are
prepared
to
give
him
battle
if
that
be
so
then
those
who
are
serving
and
those
who
are
harming
the
country
are
both
his
devotees
why
then
trouble
to
preach
patriotism
in
the
case
of
one
own
country
it
is
different
there
the
heart
clearly
demands
worship
if
you
push
the
same
argument
further
you
can
say
that
since
god
is
manifested
in
us
our
has
to
be
worshipped
before
all
else
because
our
natural
instinct
claims
it
look
here
nikhil
this
is
all
merely
dry
logic
ca
you
recognize
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
feeling
i
tell
you
the
truth
sandip
my
husband
replied
it
is
my
feelings
that
are
outraged
whenever
you
try
to
pass
off
injustice
as
a
duty
and
unrighteousness
as
a
moral
ideal
the
fact
that
i
am
incapable
of
stealing
is
not
due
to
my
possessing
logical
faculties
but
to
my
having
some
feeling
of
respect
for
myself
and
love
for
ideals
i
was
raging
inwardly
at
last
i
could
keep
silent
no
longer
is
not
the
history
of
every
country
i
cried
whether
england
france
germany
or
russia
the
history
of
stealing
for
the
sake
of
one
own
country
they
have
to
answer
for
these
thefts
they
are
doing
so
even
now
their
history
is
not
yet
ended
at
any
rate
interposed
sandip
babu
why
should
we
not
follow
suit
let
us
first
fill
our
country
coffers
with
stolen
goods
and
then
take
centuries
like
these
other
countries
to
answer
for
them
if
we
must
but
i
ask
you
where
do
you
find
this
in
history
when
rome
was
answering
for
her
sin
no
one
knew
it
all
that
time
there
was
apparently
no
limit
to
her
prosperity
but
do
you
not
see
one
thing
how
these
political
bags
of
theirs
are
bursting
with
lies
and
treacheries
breaking
their
backs
under
their
weight
never
before
had
i
had
any
opportunity
of
being
present
at
a
discussion
between
my
husband
and
his
men
friends
whenever
he
argued
with
me
i
could
feel
his
reluctance
to
push
me
into
a
corner
this
arose
out
of
the
very
love
he
bore
me
today
for
the
first
time
i
saw
his
fencer
skill
in
debate
nevertheless
my
heart
refused
to
accept
my
husband
position
i
was
struggling
to
find
some
answer
but
it
would
not
come
when
the
word
righteousness
comes
into
an
argument
it
sounds
ugly
to
say
that
a
thing
can
be
too
good
to
be
useful
all
of
a
sudden
sandip
babu
turned
to
me
with
the
question
what
do
say
to
this
i
do
not
care
about
fine
distinctions
i
broke
out
i
will
tell
you
broadly
what
i
feel
i
am
only
human
i
am
covetous
i
would
have
good
things
for
my
country
if
i
am
obliged
i
would
snatch
them
and
filch
them
i
have
anger
i
would
be
angry
for
my
country
sake
if
necessary
i
would
smite
and
slay
to
avenge
her
insults
i
have
my
desire
to
be
fascinated
and
fascination
must
be
supplied
to
me
in
bodily
shape
by
my
country
she
must
have
some
visible
symbol
casting
its
spell
upon
my
mind
i
would
make
my
country
a
person
and
call
her
mother
goddess
durga
for
whom
i
would
redden
the
earth
with
sacrificial
offerings
i
am
human
not
divine
sandip
babu
leapt
to
his
feet
with
uplifted
arms
and
shouted
hurrah
the
next
moment
he
corrected
himself
and
cried
a
shadow
of
pain
passed
over
the
face
of
my
husband
he
said
to
me
in
a
very
gentle
voice
neither
am
i
divine
i
am
human
and
therefore
i
dare
not
permit
the
evil
which
is
in
me
to
be
exaggerated
into
an
image
of
my
country
never
never
sandip
babu
cried
out
see
nikhil
how
in
the
heart
of
a
woman
truth
takes
flesh
and
blood
woman
knows
how
to
be
cruel
her
virulence
is
like
a
blind
storm
it
is
beautifully
fearful
in
man
it
is
ugly
because
it
harbours
in
its
centre
the
gnawing
worms
of
reason
and
thought
i
tell
you
nikhil
it
is
our
women
who
will
save
the
country
this
is
not
the
time
for
nice
scruples
we
must
be
unswervingly
unreasoningly
brutal
we
must
sin
we
must
give
our
women
red
sandal
paste
with
which
to
anoint
and
enthrone
our
sin
do
you
remember
what
the
poet
says
come
sin
o
beautiful
sin
let
thy
stinging
red
kisses
pour
down
fiery
red
wine
into
our
blood
sound
the
trumpet
of
imperious
evil
and
cross
our
forehead
with
the
wreath
of
exulting
lawlessness
o
deity
of
desecration
smear
our
breasts
with
the
blackest
mud
of
disrepute
unashamed
down
with
that
righteousness
which
can
not
smilingly
bring
rack
and
ruin
when
sandip
babu
standing
with
his
head
high
insulted
at
a
moment
impulse
all
that
men
have
cherished
as
their
highest
in
all
countries
and
in
all
times
a
shiver
went
right
through
my
body
but
with
a
stamp
of
his
foot
he
continued
his
declamation
i
can
see
that
you
are
that
beautiful
spirit
of
fire
which
burns
the
home
to
ashes
and
lights
up
the
larger
world
with
its
flame
give
to
us
the
indomitable
courage
to
go
to
the
bottom
of
ruin
itself
impart
grace
to
all
that
is
baneful
it
was
not
clear
to
whom
sandip
babu
addressed
his
last
appeal
it
might
have
been
she
whom
he
worshipped
with
his
it
might
have
been
the
womanhood
of
his
country
or
it
might
have
been
its
representative
the
woman
before
him
he
would
have
gone
further
in
the
same
strain
but
my
husband
suddenly
rose
from
his
seat
and
touched
him
lightly
on
the
shoulder
saying
sandip
chandranath
babu
is
here
i
started
and
turned
round
to
find
an
aged
gentleman
at
the
door
calm
and
dignified
in
doubt
as
to
whether
he
should
come
in
or
retire
his
face
was
touched
with
a
gentle
light
like
that
of
the
setting
sun
my
husband
came
up
to
me
and
whispered
this
is
my
master
of
whom
i
have
so
often
told
you
make
your
obeisance
to
him
i
bent
reverently
and
took
the
dust
of
his
feet
he
gave
me
his
blessing
saying
may
god
protect
you
always
my
little
mother
i
was
sorely
in
need
of
such
a
blessing
at
that
moment
nikhil
story
i
one
day
i
had
the
faith
to
believe
that
i
should
be
able
to
bear
whatever
came
from
my
god
i
never
had
the
trial
now
i
think
it
has
come
i
used
to
test
my
strength
of
mind
by
imagining
all
kinds
of
evil
which
might
happen
to
me
poverty
imprisonment
dishonour
death
even
bimala
and
when
i
said
to
myself
that
i
should
be
able
to
receive
these
with
firmness
i
am
sure
i
did
not
exaggerate
only
i
could
never
even
imagine
one
thing
and
today
it
is
that
of
which
i
am
thinking
and
wondering
whether
i
can
really
bear
it
there
is
a
thorn
somewhere
pricking
in
my
heart
constantly
giving
me
pain
while
i
am
about
my
daily
work
it
seems
to
persist
even
when
i
am
asleep
the
very
moment
i
wake
up
in
the
morning
i
find
that
the
bloom
has
gone
from
the
face
of
the
sky
what
is
it
what
has
happened
my
mind
has
become
so
sensitive
that
even
my
past
life
which
came
to
me
in
the
disguise
of
happiness
seems
to
wring
my
very
heart
with
its
falsehood
and
the
shame
and
sorrow
which
are
coming
close
to
me
are
losing
their
cover
of
privacy
all
the
more
because
they
try
to
veil
their
faces
my
heart
has
become
all
eyes
the
things
that
should
not
be
seen
the
things
i
do
not
want
to
see
these
i
must
see
the
day
has
come
at
last
when
my
life
has
to
reveal
its
destitution
in
a
series
of
exposures
this
penury
all
unexpected
has
taken
its
seat
in
the
heart
where
plenitude
seemed
to
reign
the
fees
which
i
paid
to
delusion
for
just
nine
years
of
my
youth
have
now
to
be
returned
with
interest
to
truth
till
the
end
of
my
days
what
is
the
use
of
straining
to
keep
up
my
pride
what
harm
if
i
confess
that
i
have
something
lacking
in
me
possibly
it
is
that
unreasoning
forcefulness
which
women
love
to
find
in
men
but
is
strength
mere
display
of
muscularity
must
strength
have
no
scruples
in
treading
the
weak
underfoot
but
why
all
these
arguments
worthiness
can
not
be
earned
merely
by
disputing
about
it
and
i
am
unworthy
unworthy
unworthy
what
if
i
am
unworthy
the
true
value
of
love
is
this
that
it
can
ever
bless
the
unworthy
with
its
own
prodigality
for
the
worthy
there
are
many
rewards
on
god
earth
but
god
has
specially
reserved
love
for
the
unworthy
up
till
now
bimala
was
my
bimala
the
product
of
the
confined
space
and
the
daily
routine
of
small
duties
did
the
love
which
i
received
from
her
i
asked
myself
come
from
the
deep
spring
of
her
heart
or
was
it
merely
like
the
daily
provision
of
pipe
water
pumped
up
by
the
municipal
of
society
i
longed
to
find
bimala
blossoming
fully
in
all
her
truth
and
power
but
the
thing
i
forgot
to
calculate
was
that
one
must
give
up
all
claims
based
on
conventional
rights
if
one
would
find
a
person
freely
revealed
in
truth
why
did
i
fail
to
think
of
this
was
it
because
of
the
pride
of
possession
over
his
wife
no
it
was
because
i
placed
the
fullest
trust
upon
love
i
was
vain
enough
to
think
that
i
had
the
power
in
me
to
bear
the
sight
of
truth
in
its
awful
nakedness
it
was
tempting
providence
but
still
i
clung
to
my
proud
determination
to
come
out
victorious
in
the
trial
bimala
had
failed
to
understand
me
in
one
thing
she
could
not
fully
realize
that
i
held
as
weakness
all
imposition
of
force
only
the
weak
dare
not
be
just
they
shirk
their
responsibility
of
fairness
and
try
quickly
to
get
at
results
through
the
cuts
of
injustice
bimala
has
no
patience
with
patience
she
loves
to
find
in
men
the
turbulent
the
angry
the
unjust
her
respect
must
have
its
element
of
fear
i
had
hoped
that
when
bimala
found
herself
free
in
the
outer
world
she
would
be
rescued
from
her
infatuation
for
tyranny
but
now
i
feel
sure
that
this
infatuation
is
deep
down
in
her
nature
her
love
is
for
the
boisterous
from
the
tip
of
her
tongue
to
the
pit
of
her
stomach
she
must
tingle
with
red
pepper
in
order
to
enjoy
the
simple
fare
of
life
but
my
determination
was
never
to
do
my
duty
with
frantic
impetuosity
helped
on
by
the
fiery
liquor
of
excitement
i
know
bimala
finds
it
difficult
to
respect
me
for
this
taking
my
scruples
for
feebleness
and
she
is
quite
angry
with
me
because
i
am
not
running
amuck
crying
for
the
matter
of
that
i
have
become
unpopular
with
all
my
countrymen
because
i
have
not
joined
them
in
their
carousals
they
are
certain
that
either
i
have
a
longing
for
some
title
or
else
that
i
am
afraid
of
the
police
the
police
on
their
side
suspect
me
of
harbouring
some
hidden
design
and
protesting
too
much
in
my
mildness
what
i
really
feel
is
this
that
those
who
can
not
find
food
for
their
enthusiasm
in
a
knowledge
of
their
country
as
it
actually
is
or
those
who
can
not
love
men
just
because
they
are
men
who
needs
must
shout
and
deify
their
country
in
order
to
keep
up
their
excitement
these
love
excitement
more
than
their
country
to
try
to
give
our
infatuation
a
higher
place
than
truth
is
a
sign
of
inherent
slavishness
where
our
minds
are
free
we
find
ourselves
lost
our
moribund
vitality
must
have
for
its
rider
either
some
fantasy
or
someone
in
authority
or
a
sanction
from
the
pundits
in
order
to
make
it
move
so
long
as
we
are
impervious
to
truth
and
have
to
be
moved
by
some
hypnotic
stimulus
we
must
know
that
we
lack
the
capacity
for
government
whatever
may
be
our
condition
we
shall
either
need
some
imaginary
ghost
or
some
actual
to
terrorize
over
us
the
other
day
when
sandip
accused
me
of
lack
of
imagination
saying
that
this
prevented
me
from
realizing
my
country
in
a
visible
image
bimala
agreed
with
him
i
did
not
say
anything
in
my
defence
because
to
win
in
argument
does
not
lead
to
happiness
her
difference
of
opinion
is
not
due
to
any
inequality
of
intelligence
but
rather
to
dissimilarity
of
nature
they
accuse
me
of
being
unimaginative
that
is
according
to
them
i
may
have
oil
in
my
lamp
but
no
flame
now
this
is
exactly
the
accusation
which
i
bring
against
them
i
would
say
to
them
you
are
dark
even
as
the
flints
are
you
must
come
to
violent
conflicts
and
make
a
noise
in
order
to
produce
your
sparks
but
their
disconnected
flashes
merely
assist
your
pride
and
not
your
clear
vision
i
have
been
noticing
for
some
time
that
there
is
a
gross
cupidity
about
sandip
his
fleshly
feelings
make
him
harbour
delusions
about
his
religion
and
impel
him
into
a
tyrannical
attitude
in
his
patriotism
his
intellect
is
keen
but
his
nature
is
coarse
and
so
he
glorifies
his
selfish
lusts
under
names
the
cheap
consolations
of
hatred
are
as
urgently
necessary
for
him
as
the
satisfaction
of
his
appetites
bimala
has
often
warned
me
in
the
old
days
of
his
hankering
after
money
i
understood
this
but
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
haggle
with
sandip
i
felt
ashamed
even
to
own
to
myself
that
he
was
trying
to
take
advantage
of
me
it
will
however
be
difficult
to
explain
to
bimala
today
that
sandip
love
of
country
is
but
a
different
phase
of
his
covetous
bimala
of
sandip
makes
me
hesitate
all
the
more
to
talk
to
her
about
him
lest
some
touch
of
jealousy
may
lead
me
unwittingly
into
exaggeration
it
may
be
that
the
pain
at
my
heart
is
already
making
me
see
a
distorted
picture
of
sandip
and
yet
it
is
better
perhaps
to
speak
out
than
to
keep
my
feelings
gnawing
within
me
ii
i
have
known
my
master
these
thirty
years
neither
calumny
nor
disaster
nor
death
itself
has
any
terrors
for
him
nothing
could
have
saved
me
born
as
i
was
into
the
traditions
of
this
family
of
ours
but
that
he
has
established
his
own
life
in
the
centre
of
mine
with
its
peace
and
truth
and
spiritual
vision
thus
making
it
possible
for
me
to
realize
goodness
in
its
truth
my
master
came
to
me
that
day
and
said
is
it
necessary
to
detain
sandip
here
any
longer
his
nature
was
so
sensitive
to
all
omens
of
evil
that
he
had
at
once
understood
he
was
not
easily
moved
but
that
day
he
felt
the
dark
shadow
of
trouble
ahead
do
i
not
know
how
well
he
loves
me
at
i
said
to
sandip
i
have
just
had
a
letter
from
rangpur
they
are
complaining
that
i
am
selfishly
detaining
you
when
will
you
be
going
there
bimala
was
pouring
out
the
tea
her
face
fell
at
once
she
threw
just
one
enquiring
glance
at
sandip
i
have
been
thinking
said
sandip
that
this
wandering
up
and
down
means
a
tremendous
waste
of
energy
i
feel
that
if
i
could
work
from
a
centre
i
could
achieve
more
permanent
results
with
this
he
looked
up
at
bimala
and
asked
do
you
not
think
so
too
bimala
hesitated
for
a
reply
and
then
said
both
ways
seem
good
to
do
the
work
from
a
centre
as
well
as
by
travelling
about
that
in
which
you
find
greater
satisfaction
is
the
way
for
you
then
let
me
speak
out
my
mind
said
sandip
i
have
never
yet
found
any
one
source
of
inspiration
suffice
me
for
good
that
is
why
i
have
been
constantly
moving
about
rousing
enthusiasm
in
the
people
from
which
in
turn
i
draw
my
own
store
of
energy
today
you
have
given
me
the
message
of
my
country
such
fire
i
have
never
beheld
in
any
man
i
shall
be
able
to
spread
the
fire
of
enthusiasm
in
my
country
by
borrowing
it
from
you
no
do
not
be
ashamed
you
are
far
above
all
modesty
and
diffidence
you
are
the
queen
bee
of
our
hive
and
we
the
workers
shall
rally
around
you
you
shall
be
our
centre
our
inspiration
bimala
flushed
all
over
with
bashful
pride
and
her
hand
shook
as
she
went
on
pouring
out
the
tea
another
day
my
master
came
to
me
and
said
why
do
you
two
go
up
to
darjeeling
for
a
change
you
are
not
looking
well
have
you
been
getting
enough
sleep
i
asked
bimala
in
the
evening
whether
she
would
care
to
have
a
trip
to
the
hills
i
knew
she
had
a
great
longing
to
see
the
himalayas
but
she
refused
the
country
cause
i
suppose
i
must
not
lose
my
faith
i
shall
wait
the
passage
from
the
narrow
to
the
larger
world
is
stormy
when
she
is
familiar
with
this
freedom
then
i
shall
know
where
my
place
is
if
i
discover
that
i
do
not
fit
in
with
the
arrangement
of
the
outer
world
then
i
shall
not
quarrel
with
my
fate
but
silently
take
my
leave
use
force
but
for
what
can
force
prevail
against
truth
sandip
story
i
the
impotent
man
says
that
which
has
come
to
my
share
is
mine
and
the
weak
man
assents
but
the
lesson
of
the
whole
world
is
that
is
really
mine
which
i
can
snatch
away
my
country
does
not
become
mine
simply
because
it
is
the
country
of
my
birth
it
becomes
mine
on
the
day
when
i
am
able
to
win
it
by
force
every
man
has
a
natural
right
to
possess
and
therefore
greed
is
natural
it
is
not
in
the
wisdom
of
nature
that
we
should
be
content
to
be
deprived
what
my
mind
covets
my
surroundings
must
supply
this
is
the
only
true
understanding
between
our
inner
and
outer
nature
in
this
world
let
moral
ideals
remain
merely
for
those
poor
anaemic
creatures
of
starved
desire
whose
grasp
is
weak
those
who
can
desire
with
all
their
soul
and
enjoy
with
all
their
heart
those
who
have
no
hesitation
or
scruple
it
is
they
who
are
the
anointed
of
providence
nature
spreads
out
her
riches
and
loveliest
treasures
for
their
benefit
they
swim
across
streams
leap
over
walls
kick
open
doors
to
help
themselves
to
whatever
is
worth
taking
in
such
a
getting
one
can
rejoice
such
wresting
as
this
gives
value
to
the
thing
taken
nature
surrenders
herself
but
only
to
the
robber
for
she
delights
in
this
forceful
desire
this
forceful
abduction
and
so
she
does
not
put
the
garland
of
her
acceptance
round
the
lean
scraggy
neck
of
the
ascetic
the
music
of
the
wedding
march
is
struck
the
time
of
the
wedding
i
must
not
let
pass
my
heart
therefore
is
eager
for
who
is
the
bridegroom
it
is
i
the
bridegroom
place
belongs
to
him
who
torch
in
hand
can
come
in
time
the
bridegroom
in
nature
wedding
hall
comes
unexpected
and
uninvited
ashamed
no
i
am
never
ashamed
i
ask
for
whatever
i
want
and
i
do
not
always
wait
to
ask
before
i
take
it
those
who
are
deprived
by
their
own
diffidence
dignify
their
privation
by
the
name
of
modesty
the
world
into
which
we
are
born
is
the
world
of
reality
when
a
man
goes
away
from
the
market
of
real
things
with
empty
hands
and
empty
stomach
merely
filling
his
bag
with
big
sounding
words
i
wonder
why
he
ever
came
into
this
hard
world
at
all
did
these
men
get
their
appointment
from
the
epicures
of
the
religious
world
to
play
set
tunes
on
sweet
pious
texts
in
that
pleasure
garden
where
blossom
airy
nothings
i
neither
affect
those
tunes
nor
do
i
find
any
sustenance
in
those
blossoms
what
i
desire
i
desire
positively
superlatively
i
want
to
knead
it
with
both
my
hands
and
both
my
feet
i
want
to
smear
it
all
over
my
body
i
want
to
gorge
myself
with
it
to
the
full
the
scrannel
pipes
of
those
who
have
worn
themselves
out
by
their
moral
fastings
till
they
have
become
flat
and
pale
like
starved
vermin
infesting
a
bed
will
never
reach
my
ear
i
would
conceal
nothing
because
that
would
be
cowardly
but
if
i
can
not
bring
myself
to
conceal
when
concealment
is
needful
that
also
is
cowardly
because
you
have
your
greed
you
build
your
walls
because
i
have
my
greed
i
break
through
them
you
use
your
power
i
use
my
craft
these
are
the
realities
of
life
on
these
depend
kingdoms
and
empires
and
all
the
great
enterprises
of
men
as
for
those
who
come
down
from
their
paradise
to
talk
to
us
in
some
holy
jargon
their
words
are
not
real
therefore
in
spite
of
all
the
applause
they
get
these
sayings
of
theirs
only
find
a
place
in
the
hiding
corners
of
the
weak
they
are
despised
by
those
who
are
strong
the
rulers
of
the
world
those
who
have
had
the
courage
to
see
this
have
won
success
while
those
poor
wretches
who
are
dragged
one
way
by
nature
and
the
other
way
by
these
ava
tars
they
set
one
foot
in
the
boat
of
the
real
and
the
other
in
the
boat
of
the
unreal
and
thus
are
in
a
pitiable
plight
able
neither
to
advance
nor
to
keep
their
place
there
are
many
men
who
seem
to
have
been
born
only
with
an
obsession
to
die
possibly
there
is
a
beauty
like
that
of
a
sunset
in
this
lingering
death
in
life
which
seems
to
fascinate
them
nikhil
lives
this
kind
of
life
if
life
it
may
be
called
years
ago
i
had
a
great
argument
with
him
on
this
point
it
is
true
he
said
that
you
can
not
get
anything
except
by
force
but
then
what
is
this
force
and
then
also
what
is
this
getting
the
strength
i
believe
in
is
the
strength
of
renouncing
so
you
i
exclaimed
are
infatuated
with
the
glory
of
bankruptcy
just
as
desperately
as
the
chick
is
infatuated
about
the
bankruptcy
of
its
shell
he
replied
the
shell
is
real
enough
yet
it
is
given
up
in
exchange
for
intangible
light
and
air
a
sorry
exchange
i
suppose
you
would
call
it
when
once
nikhil
gets
on
to
metaphor
there
is
no
hope
of
making
him
see
that
he
is
merely
dealing
with
words
not
with
realities
well
well
let
him
be
happy
with
his
metaphors
we
are
the
of
the
world
we
have
teeth
and
nails
we
pursue
and
grab
and
tear
we
are
not
satisfied
with
chewing
in
the
evening
the
cud
of
the
grass
we
have
eaten
in
the
morning
anyhow
we
can
not
allow
your
to
bar
the
door
to
our
sustenance
in
that
case
we
shall
simply
steal
or
rob
for
we
must
live
people
will
say
that
i
am
starting
some
novel
theory
just
because
those
who
are
moving
in
this
world
are
in
the
habit
of
talking
differently
though
they
are
really
acting
up
to
it
all
the
time
therefore
they
fail
to
understand
as
i
do
that
this
is
the
only
working
moral
principle
in
point
of
fact
i
know
that
my
idea
is
not
an
empty
theory
at
all
for
it
has
been
proved
in
practical
life
i
have
found
that
my
way
always
wins
over
the
hearts
of
women
who
are
creatures
of
this
world
of
reality
and
do
not
roam
about
in
as
men
do
in
balloons
women
find
in
my
features
my
manner
my
gait
my
speech
a
masterful
passion
not
a
passion
dried
thin
with
the
heat
of
asceticism
not
a
passion
with
its
face
turned
back
at
every
step
in
doubt
and
debate
but
a
passion
it
roars
and
rolls
on
like
a
flood
with
the
cry
i
want
i
want
i
want
women
feel
in
their
own
heart
of
hearts
that
this
indomitable
passion
is
the
lifeblood
of
the
world
acknowledging
no
law
but
itself
and
therefore
victorious
for
this
reason
they
have
so
often
abandoned
themselves
to
be
swept
away
on
the
of
my
passion
recking
naught
as
to
whether
it
takes
them
to
life
or
to
death
this
power
which
wins
these
women
is
the
power
of
mighty
men
the
power
which
wins
the
world
of
reality
those
who
imagine
the
greater
desirability
of
another
world
merely
shift
their
desires
from
the
earth
to
the
skies
it
remains
to
be
seen
how
high
their
gushing
fountain
will
play
and
for
how
long
but
this
much
is
certain
women
were
not
created
for
these
pale
creatures
these
of
idealism
affinity
when
it
suited
my
need
i
have
often
said
that
god
has
created
special
pairs
of
men
and
women
and
that
the
union
of
such
is
the
only
legitimate
union
higher
than
all
unions
made
by
law
the
reason
of
it
is
that
though
man
wants
to
follow
nature
he
can
find
no
pleasure
in
it
unless
he
screens
himself
with
some
phrase
and
that
is
why
this
world
is
so
overflowing
with
lies
affinity
why
should
there
be
only
one
there
may
be
affinity
with
thousands
it
was
never
in
my
agreement
with
nature
that
i
should
overlook
all
my
innumerable
affinities
for
the
sake
of
only
one
i
have
discovered
many
in
my
own
life
up
to
now
yet
that
has
not
closed
the
door
to
one
more
and
that
one
is
clearly
visible
to
my
eyes
she
has
also
discovered
her
own
affinity
to
me
and
then
then
if
i
do
not
win
i
am
a
coward
chapter
three
bimala
story
vi
i
wonder
what
could
have
happened
to
my
feeling
of
shame
the
fact
is
i
had
no
time
to
think
about
myself
my
days
and
nights
were
passing
in
a
whirl
like
an
eddy
with
myself
in
the
centre
no
gap
was
left
for
hesitation
or
delicacy
to
enter
one
day
my
remarked
to
my
husband
up
to
now
the
women
of
this
house
have
been
kept
weeping
here
comes
the
turn
we
must
see
that
they
do
not
miss
it
she
continued
turning
to
me
i
see
you
are
out
for
the
fray
chota
rani
hurl
your
shafts
straight
at
their
hearts
her
keen
eyes
looked
me
up
and
down
not
one
of
the
colours
into
which
my
toilet
my
dress
my
manners
my
speech
had
blossomed
out
had
escaped
her
i
am
ashamed
to
speak
of
it
today
but
i
felt
no
shame
then
something
within
me
was
at
work
of
which
i
was
not
even
conscious
i
used
to
overdress
it
is
true
but
more
like
an
automaton
with
no
particular
design
no
doubt
i
knew
which
effort
of
mine
would
prove
specially
pleasing
to
sandip
babu
but
that
required
no
intuition
for
he
would
discuss
it
openly
before
all
of
them
one
day
he
said
to
my
husband
do
you
know
nikhil
when
i
first
saw
our
queen
bee
she
was
sitting
there
so
demurely
in
her
bordered
her
eyes
were
gazing
inquiringly
into
space
like
stars
which
had
lost
their
way
just
as
if
she
had
been
for
ages
standing
on
the
edge
of
some
darkness
looking
out
for
something
unknown
but
when
i
saw
her
i
felt
a
quiver
run
through
me
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
gold
border
of
her
was
her
own
inner
fire
flaming
out
and
twining
round
her
that
is
the
flame
we
want
visible
fire
look
here
queen
bee
you
really
must
do
us
the
favour
of
dressing
once
more
as
a
living
flame
so
long
i
had
been
like
a
small
river
at
the
border
of
a
village
my
rhythm
and
my
language
were
different
from
what
they
are
now
but
the
tide
came
up
from
the
sea
and
my
breast
heaved
my
banks
gave
way
and
the
great
drumbeats
of
the
sea
waves
echoed
in
my
mad
current
i
could
not
understand
the
meaning
of
that
sound
in
my
blood
where
was
that
former
self
of
mine
whence
came
foaming
into
me
this
surging
flood
of
glory
sandip
hungry
eyes
burnt
like
the
lamps
of
worship
before
my
shrine
all
his
gaze
proclaimed
that
i
was
a
wonder
in
beauty
and
power
and
the
loudness
of
his
praise
spoken
and
unspoken
drowned
all
other
voices
in
my
world
had
the
creator
created
me
afresh
i
wondered
did
he
wish
to
make
up
now
for
neglecting
me
so
long
i
who
before
was
plain
had
become
suddenly
beautiful
i
who
before
had
been
of
no
account
now
felt
in
myself
all
the
splendour
of
bengal
itself
for
sandip
babu
was
not
a
mere
individual
in
him
was
the
confluence
of
millions
of
minds
of
the
country
when
he
called
me
the
queen
bee
of
the
hive
i
was
acclaimed
with
a
chorus
of
praise
by
all
our
patriot
workers
after
that
the
loud
jests
of
my
could
not
touch
me
any
longer
my
relations
with
all
the
world
underwent
a
change
sandip
babu
made
it
clear
how
all
the
country
was
in
need
of
me
i
had
no
difficulty
in
believing
this
at
the
time
for
i
felt
that
i
had
the
power
to
do
everything
divine
strength
had
come
to
me
it
was
something
which
i
had
never
felt
before
which
was
beyond
myself
i
had
no
time
to
question
it
to
find
out
what
was
its
nature
it
seemed
to
belong
to
me
and
yet
to
transcend
me
it
comprehended
the
whole
of
bengal
sandip
babu
would
consult
me
about
every
little
thing
touching
the
cause
at
first
i
felt
very
awkward
and
would
hang
back
but
that
soon
wore
off
whatever
i
suggested
seemed
to
astonish
him
he
would
go
into
raptures
and
say
men
can
only
think
you
women
have
a
way
of
understanding
without
thinking
woman
was
created
out
of
god
own
fancy
man
he
had
to
hammer
into
shape
letters
used
to
come
to
sandip
babu
from
all
parts
of
the
country
which
were
submitted
to
me
for
my
opinion
occasionally
he
disagreed
with
me
but
i
would
not
argue
with
him
then
after
a
day
or
two
as
if
a
new
light
had
suddenly
dawned
upon
him
he
would
send
for
me
and
say
it
was
my
mistake
your
suggestion
was
the
correct
one
he
would
often
confess
to
me
that
wherever
he
had
taken
steps
contrary
to
my
advice
he
had
gone
wrong
thus
i
gradually
came
to
be
convinced
that
behind
whatever
was
taking
place
was
sandip
babu
and
behind
sandip
babu
was
the
plain
common
sense
of
a
woman
the
glory
of
a
great
responsibility
filled
my
being
my
husband
had
no
place
in
our
counsels
sandip
babu
treated
him
as
a
younger
brother
of
whom
personally
one
may
be
very
fond
and
yet
have
no
use
for
his
business
advice
he
would
tenderly
and
smilingly
talk
about
my
husband
childlike
innocence
saying
that
his
curious
doctrine
and
perversities
of
mind
had
a
flavour
of
humour
which
made
them
all
the
more
lovable
it
was
seemingly
this
very
affection
for
nikhil
which
led
sandip
babu
to
forbear
from
troubling
him
with
the
burden
of
the
country
nature
has
many
anodynes
in
her
pharmacy
which
she
secretly
administers
when
vital
relations
are
being
insidiously
severed
so
that
none
may
know
of
the
operation
till
at
last
one
awakes
to
know
what
a
great
rent
has
been
made
when
the
knife
was
busy
with
my
life
most
intimate
tie
my
mind
was
so
clouded
with
fumes
of
intoxicating
gas
that
i
was
not
in
the
least
aware
of
what
a
cruel
thing
was
happening
possibly
this
is
nature
when
her
passion
is
roused
she
loses
her
sensibility
for
all
that
is
outside
it
when
like
the
river
we
women
keep
to
our
banks
we
give
nourishment
with
all
that
we
have
when
we
overflow
them
we
destroy
with
all
that
we
are
bimala
the
younger
brother
wife
was
the
or
junior
rani
sandip
story
ii
i
can
see
that
something
has
gone
wrong
i
got
an
inkling
of
it
the
other
day
ever
since
my
arrival
nikhil
had
become
a
thing
amphibious
half
women
apartment
half
men
bimala
had
access
to
it
from
the
zenana
it
was
not
barred
to
me
from
the
outer
side
if
we
had
only
gone
slow
and
made
use
of
our
privileges
with
some
restraint
we
might
not
have
fallen
foul
of
other
people
but
we
went
ahead
so
vehemently
that
we
could
not
think
of
the
consequences
whenever
bee
comes
into
nikhil
room
i
somehow
get
to
know
of
it
from
mine
there
are
the
tinkle
of
bangles
and
other
little
sounds
the
door
is
perhaps
shut
with
a
shade
of
unnecessary
vehemence
the
bookcase
is
a
trifle
stiff
and
creaks
if
jerked
open
when
i
enter
i
find
bee
with
her
back
to
the
door
ever
so
busy
selecting
a
book
from
the
shelves
and
as
i
offer
to
assist
her
in
this
difficult
task
she
starts
and
protests
and
then
we
naturally
get
on
to
other
topics
the
other
day
on
an
inauspicious
thursday
afternoon
i
sallied
forth
from
my
room
at
the
call
of
these
same
sounds
there
was
a
man
on
guard
in
the
passage
i
walked
on
without
so
much
as
glancing
at
him
but
as
i
approached
the
door
he
put
himself
in
my
way
saying
not
that
way
sir
not
that
way
why
the
rani
mother
is
there
oh
very
well
tell
your
rani
mother
that
sandip
babu
wants
to
see
her
that
can
not
be
sir
it
is
against
orders
i
felt
highly
indignant
i
order
you
i
said
in
a
raised
voice
go
and
announce
me
the
fellow
was
somewhat
taken
aback
at
my
attitude
in
the
meantime
i
had
neared
the
door
i
was
on
the
point
of
reaching
it
when
he
followed
after
me
and
took
me
by
the
arm
saying
no
sir
you
must
not
what
to
be
touched
by
a
flunkey
i
snatched
away
my
arm
and
gave
the
man
a
sounding
blow
at
this
moment
bee
came
out
of
the
room
to
find
the
man
about
to
insult
me
i
shall
never
forget
the
picture
of
her
wrath
that
bee
is
beautiful
is
a
discovery
of
my
own
most
of
our
people
would
see
nothing
in
her
her
tall
slim
figure
these
boors
would
call
lanky
but
it
is
just
this
lithesomeness
of
hers
that
i
admire
like
an
fountain
of
life
coming
direct
out
of
the
depths
of
the
creator
heart
her
complexion
is
dark
but
it
is
the
lustrous
darkness
of
a
keen
and
scintillating
nanku
she
commanded
as
she
stood
in
the
doorway
pointing
with
her
finger
leave
us
do
not
be
angry
with
him
said
i
if
it
is
against
orders
it
is
i
who
should
retire
bee
voice
was
still
trembling
as
she
replied
you
must
not
go
come
in
it
was
not
a
request
but
again
a
command
i
followed
her
in
and
taking
a
chair
fanned
myself
with
a
fan
which
was
on
the
table
bee
scribbled
something
with
a
pencil
on
a
sheet
of
paper
and
summoning
a
servant
handed
it
to
him
saying
take
this
to
the
maharaja
forgive
me
i
resumed
i
was
unable
to
control
myself
and
hit
that
man
of
yours
you
served
him
right
said
bee
but
it
was
not
the
poor
fellow
fault
after
all
he
was
only
obeying
his
orders
here
nikhil
came
in
and
as
he
did
so
i
left
my
seat
with
a
rapid
movement
and
went
and
stood
near
the
window
with
my
back
to
the
room
nanku
the
guard
has
insulted
sandip
babu
said
bee
to
nikhil
nikhil
seemed
to
be
so
genuinely
surprised
that
i
had
to
turn
round
and
stare
at
him
even
an
outrageously
good
man
fails
in
keeping
up
his
pride
of
truthfulness
before
his
wife
if
she
be
the
proper
kind
of
woman
he
insolently
stood
in
the
way
when
sandip
babu
was
coming
in
here
continued
bee
he
said
he
had
orders
whose
orders
asked
nikhil
how
am
i
to
know
exclaimed
bee
impatiently
her
eyes
brimming
over
with
mortification
nikhil
sent
for
the
man
and
questioned
him
it
was
not
my
fault
nanku
repeated
sullenly
i
had
my
orders
who
gave
you
the
order
the
bara
rani
mother
we
were
all
silent
for
a
while
after
the
man
had
left
bee
said
nanku
must
go
nikhil
remained
silent
i
could
see
that
his
sense
of
justice
would
not
allow
this
there
was
no
end
to
his
qualms
but
this
time
he
was
up
against
a
tough
problem
bee
was
not
the
woman
to
take
things
lying
down
she
would
have
to
get
even
with
her
by
punishing
this
fellow
and
as
nikhil
remained
silent
her
eyes
flashed
fire
she
knew
not
how
to
pour
her
scorn
upon
her
husband
feebleness
of
spirit
nikhil
left
the
room
after
a
while
without
another
word
the
next
day
nanku
was
not
to
be
seen
on
inquiry
i
learnt
that
he
had
been
sent
off
to
some
other
part
of
the
estates
and
that
his
wages
had
not
suffered
by
such
transfer
i
could
catch
glimpses
of
the
ravages
of
the
storm
raging
over
this
behind
the
scenes
all
i
can
say
is
that
nikhil
is
a
curious
creature
quite
out
of
the
common
the
upshot
was
that
after
this
bee
began
to
send
for
me
to
the
for
a
chat
without
any
contrivance
or
pretence
of
its
being
an
accident
thus
from
bare
suggestion
we
came
to
broad
hint
the
implied
came
to
be
expressed
the
law
of
a
princely
house
lives
in
a
starry
region
so
remote
from
the
ordinary
outsider
that
there
is
not
even
a
regular
road
for
his
approach
what
a
triumphal
progress
of
truth
was
this
which
gradually
but
persistently
thrust
aside
veil
after
veil
of
obscuring
custom
till
at
length
nature
herself
was
laid
bare
truth
of
course
it
was
the
truth
the
attraction
of
man
and
woman
for
each
other
is
fundamental
the
whole
world
of
matter
from
the
speck
of
dust
upwards
is
ranged
on
its
side
and
yet
men
would
keep
it
hidden
away
out
of
sight
behind
a
tissue
of
words
and
with
sanctions
and
prohibitions
make
of
it
a
domestic
utensil
why
it
as
absurd
as
melting
down
the
solar
system
to
make
a
for
one
when
in
spite
of
all
reality
awakes
at
the
call
of
what
is
but
naked
truth
what
a
gnashing
of
teeth
and
beating
of
breasts
is
there
but
can
one
carry
on
a
quarrel
with
a
storm
it
never
takes
the
trouble
to
reply
it
only
gives
a
shaking
i
am
enjoying
the
sight
of
this
truth
as
it
gradually
reveals
itself
these
tremblings
of
steps
these
turnings
of
the
face
are
sweet
to
me
and
sweet
are
the
deceptions
which
deceive
not
only
others
but
also
bee
herself
when
reality
has
to
meet
the
unreal
deception
is
its
principal
weapon
for
its
enemies
always
try
to
shame
reality
by
calling
it
gross
and
so
it
needs
must
hide
itself
or
else
put
on
some
disguise
the
circumstances
are
such
that
it
dare
not
frankly
avow
yes
i
am
gross
because
i
am
true
i
am
flesh
i
am
passion
i
am
hunger
unashamed
and
cruel
all
is
now
clear
to
me
the
curtain
flaps
and
through
it
i
can
see
the
preparations
for
the
catastrophe
the
little
red
ribbon
which
peeps
through
the
luxuriant
masses
of
her
hair
with
its
flush
of
secret
longing
it
is
the
lolling
tongue
of
the
red
storm
cloud
i
feel
the
warmth
of
each
turn
of
her
each
suggestion
of
her
raiment
of
which
even
the
wearer
may
not
be
fully
conscious
bee
was
not
conscious
because
she
was
ashamed
of
the
reality
to
which
men
have
given
a
bad
name
calling
it
satan
and
so
it
has
to
steal
into
the
garden
of
paradise
in
the
guise
of
a
snake
and
whisper
secrets
into
the
ears
of
man
chosen
consort
and
make
her
rebellious
then
farewell
to
all
ease
and
after
that
comes
death
my
poor
little
queen
bee
is
living
in
a
dream
she
knows
not
which
way
she
is
treading
it
would
not
be
safe
to
awaken
her
before
the
time
it
is
best
for
me
to
pretend
to
be
equally
unconscious
the
other
day
at
dinner
she
was
gazing
at
me
in
a
curious
sort
of
way
little
realizing
what
such
glances
mean
as
my
eyes
met
hers
she
turned
away
with
a
flush
you
are
surprised
at
my
appetite
i
remarked
i
can
hide
everything
except
that
i
am
greedy
anyhow
why
trouble
to
blush
for
me
since
i
am
shameless
this
only
made
her
colour
more
furiously
as
she
stammered
no
no
i
was
only
i
know
i
interrupted
women
have
a
weakness
for
greedy
men
for
it
is
this
greed
of
ours
which
gives
them
the
upper
hand
the
indulgence
which
i
have
always
received
at
their
hands
has
made
me
all
the
more
shameless
i
do
not
mind
your
watching
the
good
things
disappear
not
one
bit
i
mean
to
enjoy
every
one
of
them
the
other
day
i
was
reading
an
english
book
in
which
were
treated
in
an
audaciously
realistic
manner
i
had
left
it
lying
in
the
as
i
went
there
the
next
afternoon
for
something
or
other
i
found
bee
seated
with
this
book
in
her
hand
when
she
heard
my
footsteps
she
hurriedly
put
it
down
and
placed
another
book
over
it
a
volume
of
mrs
hemans
poems
i
have
never
been
able
to
make
out
i
began
why
women
are
so
shy
about
being
caught
reading
poetry
we
men
lawyers
mechanics
or
what
not
may
well
feel
ashamed
if
we
must
read
poetry
it
should
be
at
dead
of
night
within
closed
doors
but
you
women
are
so
akin
to
poesy
the
creator
himself
is
a
lyric
poet
and
jayadeva
must
have
practised
the
divine
art
seated
at
his
feet
bee
made
no
reply
but
only
blushed
uncomfortably
she
made
as
if
she
would
leave
the
room
whereupon
i
protested
no
no
pray
read
on
i
will
just
take
a
book
i
left
here
and
run
away
with
which
i
took
up
my
book
from
the
table
lucky
you
did
not
think
of
glancing
over
its
pages
i
continued
or
you
would
have
wanted
to
chastise
me
indeed
why
asked
bee
because
it
is
not
poetry
said
i
only
blunt
things
bluntly
put
without
any
finicking
niceness
i
wish
nikhil
would
read
it
bee
frowned
a
little
as
she
murmured
what
makes
you
wish
that
he
is
a
man
you
see
one
of
us
my
only
quarrel
with
him
is
that
he
delights
in
a
misty
vision
of
this
world
have
you
not
observed
how
this
trait
of
his
makes
him
look
on
as
if
it
was
some
poem
of
which
the
metre
must
be
kept
correct
at
every
step
we
with
the
clubs
of
our
prose
are
the
iconoclasts
of
metre
what
has
your
book
to
do
with
you
would
know
if
you
only
read
it
nikhil
wants
to
go
by
up
maxims
in
as
in
everything
else
so
he
knocks
up
against
human
nature
at
every
turn
and
then
falls
to
abusing
it
he
never
will
realize
that
human
nature
was
created
long
before
phrases
were
and
will
survive
them
too
bee
was
silent
for
a
while
and
then
gravely
said
is
it
not
a
part
of
human
nature
to
try
and
rise
superior
to
itself
i
smiled
inwardly
these
are
not
your
words
i
thought
to
myself
you
have
learnt
them
from
nikhil
you
are
a
healthy
human
being
your
flesh
and
blood
have
responded
to
the
call
of
reality
you
are
burning
in
every
vein
with
do
i
not
know
it
how
long
should
they
keep
you
cool
with
the
wet
towel
of
moral
precepts
the
weak
are
in
the
majority
i
said
aloud
they
are
continually
poisoning
the
ears
of
men
by
repeating
these
shibboleths
nature
has
denied
them
strength
it
is
thus
that
they
try
to
enfeeble
others
we
women
are
weak
replied
bimala
so
i
suppose
we
must
join
in
the
conspiracy
of
the
weak
women
weak
i
exclaimed
with
a
laugh
men
belaud
you
as
delicate
and
fragile
so
as
to
delude
you
into
thinking
yourselves
weak
but
it
is
you
women
who
are
strong
men
make
a
great
outward
show
of
their
freedom
but
those
who
know
their
inner
minds
are
aware
of
their
bondage
they
have
manufactured
scriptures
with
their
own
hands
to
bind
themselves
with
their
very
idealism
they
have
made
golden
fetters
of
women
to
wind
round
their
body
and
mind
if
men
had
not
that
extraordinary
faculty
of
entangling
themselves
in
meshes
of
their
own
contriving
nothing
could
have
kept
them
bound
but
as
for
you
women
you
have
desired
to
conceive
reality
with
body
and
soul
you
have
given
birth
to
reality
you
have
suckled
reality
at
your
breasts
bee
was
well
read
for
a
woman
and
would
not
easily
give
in
to
my
arguments
if
that
were
true
she
objected
men
would
not
have
found
women
attractive
women
realize
the
danger
i
replied
they
know
that
men
love
delusions
so
they
give
them
full
measure
by
borrowing
their
own
phrases
they
know
that
man
the
drunkard
values
intoxication
more
than
food
and
so
they
try
to
pass
themselves
off
as
an
intoxicant
as
a
matter
of
fact
but
for
the
sake
of
man
woman
has
no
need
for
any
why
then
are
you
troubling
to
destroy
the
illusion
for
freedom
i
want
the
country
to
be
free
i
want
human
relations
to
be
free
according
to
the
hindu
calendar
the
is
the
pet
of
a
hindu
household
a
vaishnava
poet
sanskrit
whose
lyrics
of
the
adoration
of
the
divinity
serve
as
well
to
express
all
shades
of
human
passion
iii
i
was
aware
that
it
is
unsafe
suddenly
to
awake
a
but
i
am
so
impetuous
by
nature
a
halting
gait
does
not
suit
me
i
knew
i
was
overbold
that
day
i
knew
that
the
first
shock
of
such
ideas
is
apt
to
be
almost
intolerable
but
with
women
it
is
always
audacity
that
wins
just
as
we
were
getting
on
nicely
who
should
walk
in
but
nikhil
old
tutor
chandranath
babu
the
world
would
have
been
not
half
a
bad
place
to
live
in
but
for
these
schoolmasters
who
make
one
want
to
quit
in
disgust
the
nikhil
type
wants
to
keep
the
world
always
a
school
this
incarnation
of
a
school
turned
up
that
afternoon
at
the
psychological
moment
we
all
remain
schoolboys
in
some
corner
of
our
hearts
and
i
even
i
felt
somewhat
pulled
up
as
for
poor
bee
she
at
once
took
her
place
solemnly
like
the
topmost
girl
of
the
class
on
the
front
bench
all
of
a
sudden
she
seemed
to
remember
that
she
had
to
face
her
examination
some
people
are
so
like
eternal
pointsmen
lying
in
wait
by
the
line
to
shunt
one
train
of
thought
from
one
rail
to
another
chandranath
babu
had
no
sooner
come
in
than
he
cast
about
for
some
excuse
to
retire
mumbling
i
beg
your
pardon
i
before
he
could
finish
bee
went
up
to
him
and
made
a
profound
obeisance
saying
pray
do
not
leave
us
sir
will
you
not
take
a
seat
she
looked
like
a
drowning
person
clutching
at
him
for
support
the
little
coward
but
possibly
i
was
mistaken
it
is
quite
likely
that
there
was
a
touch
of
womanly
wile
in
it
she
wanted
perhaps
to
raise
her
value
in
my
eyes
she
might
have
been
pointedly
saying
to
me
please
do
imagine
for
a
moment
that
i
am
entirely
overcome
by
you
my
respect
for
chandranath
babu
is
even
greater
well
indulge
in
your
respect
by
all
means
schoolmasters
thrive
on
it
but
not
being
one
of
them
i
have
no
use
for
that
empty
compliment
chandranath
babu
began
to
talk
about
i
thought
i
would
let
him
go
on
with
his
monologues
there
is
nothing
like
letting
an
old
man
talk
himself
out
it
makes
him
feel
that
he
is
winding
up
the
world
forgetting
all
the
while
how
far
away
the
real
world
is
from
his
wagging
tongue
but
even
my
worst
enemy
would
not
accuse
me
of
patience
and
when
chandranath
babu
went
on
to
say
if
we
expect
to
gather
fruit
where
we
have
sown
no
seed
then
we
i
had
to
interrupt
him
who
wants
fruit
i
cried
we
go
by
the
author
of
the
gita
who
says
that
we
are
concerned
only
with
the
doing
not
with
the
fruit
of
our
deeds
what
is
it
then
that
you
do
want
asked
chandranath
babu
thorns
i
exclaimed
which
cost
nothing
to
plant
thorns
do
not
obstruct
others
only
he
replied
they
have
a
way
of
hurting
one
own
feet
that
is
all
right
for
a
i
retorted
but
the
real
thing
is
that
we
have
this
burning
at
heart
now
we
have
only
to
cultivate
thorns
for
other
soles
afterwards
when
they
hurt
us
we
shall
find
leisure
to
repent
but
why
be
frightened
even
of
that
when
at
last
we
have
to
die
it
will
be
time
enough
to
get
cold
while
we
are
on
fire
let
us
seethe
and
boil
chandranath
babu
smiled
seethe
by
all
means
he
said
but
do
not
mistake
it
for
work
or
heroism
nations
which
have
got
on
in
the
world
have
done
so
by
action
not
by
ebullition
those
who
have
always
lain
in
dread
of
work
when
with
a
start
they
awake
to
their
sorry
plight
they
look
to
and
scamping
for
their
deliverance
i
was
girding
up
my
loins
to
deliver
a
crushing
reply
when
nikhil
came
back
chandranath
babu
rose
and
looking
towards
bee
said
let
me
go
now
my
little
mother
i
have
some
work
to
attend
to
as
he
left
i
showed
nikhil
the
book
in
my
hand
i
was
telling
queen
bee
about
this
book
i
said
per
cent
of
people
have
to
be
deluded
with
lies
but
it
is
easier
to
delude
this
perpetual
pupil
of
the
schoolmaster
with
the
truth
he
is
best
cheated
openly
so
in
playing
with
him
the
simplest
course
was
to
lay
my
cards
on
the
table
nikhil
read
the
title
on
the
cover
but
said
nothing
these
writers
i
continued
are
busy
with
their
brooms
sweeping
away
the
dust
of
epithets
with
which
men
have
covered
up
this
world
of
ours
so
as
i
was
saying
i
wish
you
would
read
it
i
have
read
it
said
nikhil
well
what
do
you
say
it
is
all
very
well
for
those
who
really
care
to
think
but
poison
for
those
who
shirk
thought
what
do
you
mean
those
who
preach
rights
of
property
should
not
be
thieves
for
if
they
are
they
would
be
preaching
lies
when
passion
is
in
the
ascendant
this
kind
of
book
is
not
rightly
understood
passion
i
replied
is
the
street
lamp
which
guides
us
to
call
it
untrue
is
as
hopeless
as
to
expect
to
see
better
by
plucking
out
our
natural
eyes
nikhil
was
visibly
growing
excited
i
accept
the
truth
of
passion
he
said
only
when
i
recognize
the
truth
of
restraint
by
pressing
what
we
want
to
see
right
into
our
eyes
we
only
injure
them
we
do
not
see
so
does
the
violence
of
passion
which
would
leave
no
space
between
the
mind
and
its
object
defeat
its
purpose
it
is
simply
your
intellectual
foppery
i
replied
which
makes
you
indulge
in
moral
delicacy
ignoring
the
savage
side
of
truth
this
merely
helps
you
to
mystify
things
and
so
you
fail
to
do
your
work
with
any
degree
of
strength
the
intrusion
of
strength
said
nikhil
impatiently
where
strength
is
out
of
place
does
not
help
you
in
your
work
but
why
are
we
arguing
about
these
things
vain
arguments
only
brush
off
the
fresh
bloom
of
truth
i
wanted
bee
to
join
in
the
discussion
but
she
had
not
said
a
word
up
to
now
could
i
have
given
her
too
rude
a
shock
leaving
her
assailed
with
doubts
and
wanting
to
learn
her
lesson
afresh
from
the
schoolmaster
still
a
thorough
is
essential
one
must
begin
by
realizing
that
things
supposed
to
be
unshakeable
can
be
shaken
i
am
glad
i
had
this
talk
with
you
i
said
to
nikhil
for
i
was
on
the
point
of
lending
this
book
to
queen
bee
to
read
what
harm
said
nikhil
if
i
could
read
the
book
why
not
bimala
too
all
i
want
to
say
is
that
in
europe
people
look
at
everything
from
the
viewpoint
of
science
but
man
is
neither
mere
physiology
nor
biology
nor
psychology
nor
even
sociology
for
god
sake
do
forget
that
man
is
infinitely
more
than
the
natural
science
of
himself
you
laugh
at
me
calling
me
the
schoolmaster
pupil
but
that
is
what
you
are
not
i
you
want
to
find
the
truth
of
man
from
your
science
teachers
and
not
from
your
own
inner
being
but
why
all
this
excitement
i
mocked
because
i
see
you
are
bent
on
insulting
man
and
making
him
petty
where
on
earth
do
you
see
all
that
in
the
air
in
my
outraged
feelings
you
would
go
on
wounding
the
great
the
unselfish
the
beautiful
in
man
what
mad
idea
is
this
of
yours
nikhil
suddenly
stood
up
i
tell
you
plainly
sandip
he
said
man
may
be
wounded
unto
death
but
he
will
not
die
this
is
the
reason
why
i
am
ready
to
suffer
all
knowing
all
with
eyes
open
with
these
words
he
hurriedly
left
the
room
i
was
staring
blankly
at
his
retreating
figure
when
the
sound
of
a
book
falling
from
the
table
made
me
turn
to
find
bee
following
him
with
quick
nervous
steps
making
a
detour
to
avoid
passing
too
near
me
a
curious
creature
that
nikhil
he
feels
the
danger
threatening
his
home
and
yet
why
does
he
not
turn
me
out
i
know
he
is
waiting
for
bimal
to
give
him
the
cue
if
bimal
tells
him
that
their
mating
has
been
a
misfit
he
will
bow
his
head
and
admit
that
it
may
have
been
a
blunder
he
has
not
the
strength
of
mind
to
understand
that
to
acknowledge
a
mistake
is
the
greatest
of
all
mistakes
he
is
a
typical
example
of
how
ideas
make
for
weakness
i
have
not
seen
another
like
him
so
whimsical
a
product
of
nature
he
would
hardly
do
as
a
character
in
a
novel
or
drama
to
say
nothing
of
real
life
and
bee
i
am
afraid
her
is
over
from
today
she
has
at
length
understood
the
nature
of
the
current
which
is
bearing
her
along
now
she
must
either
advance
or
retreat
the
chances
are
she
will
now
advance
a
step
and
then
retreat
a
step
but
that
does
not
disturb
me
when
one
is
on
fire
this
rushing
to
and
fro
makes
the
blaze
all
the
fiercer
the
fright
she
has
got
will
only
fan
her
passion
perhaps
i
had
better
not
say
much
to
her
but
simply
select
some
modern
books
for
her
to
read
let
her
gradually
come
to
the
conviction
that
to
acknowledge
and
respect
passion
as
the
supreme
reality
is
to
be
modern
not
to
be
ashamed
of
it
not
to
glorify
restraint
if
she
finds
shelter
in
some
such
word
as
modern
she
will
find
strength
be
that
as
it
may
i
must
see
this
out
to
the
end
of
the
fifth
act
i
can
not
unfortunately
boast
of
being
merely
a
spectator
seated
in
the
royal
box
applauding
now
and
again
there
is
a
wrench
at
my
heart
a
pang
in
every
nerve
when
i
have
put
out
the
light
and
am
in
my
bed
little
touches
little
glances
little
words
flit
about
and
fill
the
darkness
when
i
get
up
in
the
morning
i
thrill
with
lively
anticipations
my
blood
seems
to
course
through
me
to
the
strains
of
music
there
was
a
double
on
the
table
with
bee
photograph
by
the
side
of
nikhil
i
had
taken
out
hers
yesterday
i
showed
bee
the
empty
side
and
said
theft
becomes
necessary
only
because
of
miserliness
so
its
sin
must
be
divided
between
the
miser
and
the
thief
do
you
not
think
so
it
was
not
a
good
one
observed
bee
simply
with
a
little
smile
what
is
to
be
done
said
i
a
portrait
can
not
be
better
than
a
portrait
i
must
be
content
with
it
such
as
it
is
bee
took
up
a
book
and
began
to
turn
over
the
pages
if
you
are
annoyed
i
went
on
i
must
make
a
shift
to
fill
up
the
vacancy
today
i
have
filled
it
up
this
photograph
of
mine
was
taken
in
my
early
youth
my
face
was
then
fresher
and
so
was
my
mind
then
i
still
cherished
some
illusions
about
this
world
and
the
next
faith
deceives
men
but
it
has
one
great
merit
it
imparts
a
radiance
to
the
features
my
portrait
now
reposes
next
to
nikhil
for
are
not
the
two
of
us
old
friends
chapter
four
nikhil
story
iii
i
was
never
but
nowadays
i
often
try
to
take
an
outside
view
to
see
myself
as
bimal
sees
me
what
a
dismally
solemn
picture
it
makes
my
habit
of
taking
things
too
seriously
better
surely
to
laugh
away
the
world
than
flood
it
with
tears
that
is
in
fact
how
the
world
gets
on
we
relish
our
food
and
rest
only
because
we
can
dismiss
as
so
many
empty
shadows
the
sorrows
scattered
everywhere
both
in
the
home
and
in
the
outer
world
if
we
took
them
as
true
even
for
a
moment
where
would
be
our
appetite
our
sleep
but
i
can
not
dismiss
myself
as
one
of
these
shadows
and
so
the
load
of
my
sorrow
lies
eternally
heavy
on
the
heart
of
my
world
why
not
stand
out
aloof
in
the
highway
of
the
universe
and
feel
yourself
to
be
part
of
the
all
in
the
midst
of
the
immense
concourse
of
humanity
what
is
bimal
to
you
your
wife
what
is
a
wife
a
bubble
of
a
name
blown
big
with
your
own
breath
so
carefully
guarded
night
and
day
yet
ready
to
burst
at
any
from
outside
my
wife
and
so
forsooth
my
very
own
if
she
says
no
i
am
myself
am
i
to
reply
how
can
that
be
are
you
not
mine
my
wife
does
that
amount
to
an
argument
much
less
the
truth
can
one
imprison
a
whole
personality
within
that
name
my
wife
have
i
not
cherished
in
this
little
world
all
that
is
purest
and
sweetest
in
my
life
never
for
a
moment
letting
it
down
from
my
bosom
to
the
dust
what
incense
of
worship
what
music
of
passion
what
flowers
of
my
spring
and
of
my
autumn
have
i
not
offered
up
at
its
shrine
if
like
a
toy
she
be
swept
along
into
the
muddy
waters
of
the
gutter
would
i
not
also
there
it
is
again
my
incorrigible
solemnity
why
muddy
what
gutter
names
called
in
a
fit
of
jealousy
do
not
change
the
facts
of
the
world
if
bimal
is
not
mine
she
is
not
and
no
fuming
or
fretting
or
arguing
will
serve
to
prove
that
she
is
if
my
heart
is
breaking
let
it
break
that
will
not
make
the
world
bankrupt
nor
even
me
for
man
is
so
much
greater
than
the
things
he
loses
in
this
life
the
very
ocean
of
tears
has
its
other
shore
else
none
would
have
ever
wept
but
then
there
is
society
to
be
considered
which
let
society
consider
if
i
weep
it
is
for
myself
not
for
society
if
bimal
should
say
she
is
not
mine
what
care
i
where
my
society
wife
may
be
suffering
there
must
be
but
i
must
save
myself
by
any
means
in
my
power
from
one
form
of
i
must
never
think
that
my
life
loses
its
value
because
of
any
neglect
it
may
suffer
the
full
value
of
my
life
does
not
all
go
to
buy
my
narrow
domestic
world
its
great
commerce
does
not
stand
or
fall
with
some
petty
success
or
failure
in
the
bartering
of
my
personal
joys
and
sorrows
the
time
has
come
when
i
must
divest
bimala
of
all
the
ideal
decorations
with
which
i
decked
her
it
was
owing
to
my
own
weakness
that
i
indulged
in
such
idolatry
i
was
too
greedy
i
created
an
angel
of
bimala
in
order
to
exaggerate
my
own
enjoyment
but
bimala
is
what
she
is
it
is
preposterous
to
expect
that
she
should
assume
the
rôle
of
an
angel
for
my
pleasure
the
creator
is
under
no
obligation
to
supply
me
with
angels
just
because
i
have
an
avidity
for
imaginary
perfection
i
must
acknowledge
that
i
have
merely
been
an
accident
in
bimala
life
her
nature
perhaps
can
only
find
true
union
with
one
like
sandip
at
the
same
time
i
must
not
in
false
modesty
accept
my
rejection
as
my
desert
sandip
certainly
has
attractive
qualities
which
had
their
sway
also
upon
myself
but
yet
i
feel
sure
he
is
not
a
greater
man
than
i
if
the
wreath
of
victory
falls
to
his
lot
today
and
i
am
overlooked
then
the
dispenser
of
the
wreath
will
be
called
to
judgement
i
say
this
in
no
spirit
of
boasting
sheer
necessity
has
driven
me
to
the
pass
that
to
secure
myself
from
utter
desolation
i
must
recognize
all
the
value
that
i
truly
possess
therefore
through
the
terrible
experience
of
suffering
let
there
come
upon
me
the
joy
of
deliverance
deliverance
from
i
have
come
to
distinguish
what
is
really
in
me
from
what
i
foolishly
imagined
to
be
there
the
profit
and
loss
account
has
been
settled
and
that
which
remains
is
myself
not
a
crippled
self
dressed
in
rags
and
tatters
not
a
sick
self
to
be
nursed
on
invalid
diet
but
a
spirit
which
has
gone
through
the
worst
and
has
survived
my
master
passed
through
my
room
a
moment
ago
and
said
with
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
get
away
to
bed
nikhil
the
night
is
far
advanced
the
fact
is
it
has
become
so
difficult
for
me
to
go
to
bed
till
late
till
bimal
is
fast
asleep
in
the
we
meet
and
even
converse
but
what
am
i
to
say
when
we
are
alone
together
in
the
silence
of
the
night
so
ashamed
do
i
feel
in
mind
and
body
how
is
it
sir
you
have
not
yet
retired
i
asked
in
my
turn
my
master
smiled
a
little
as
he
left
me
saying
my
sleeping
days
are
over
i
have
now
attained
the
waking
age
i
had
written
thus
far
and
was
about
to
rise
to
go
off
bedwards
when
through
the
window
before
me
i
saw
the
heavy
pall
of
july
cloud
suddenly
part
a
little
and
a
big
star
shine
through
it
seemed
to
say
to
me
dreamland
ties
are
made
and
dreamland
ties
are
broken
but
i
am
here
for
ever
the
everlasting
lamp
of
the
bridal
night
all
at
once
my
heart
was
full
with
the
thought
that
my
eternal
love
was
steadfastly
waiting
for
me
through
the
ages
behind
the
veil
of
material
things
through
many
a
life
in
many
a
mirror
have
i
seen
her
image
broken
mirrors
crooked
mirrors
dusty
mirrors
whenever
i
have
sought
to
make
the
mirror
my
very
own
and
shut
it
up
within
my
box
i
have
lost
sight
of
the
image
but
what
of
that
what
have
i
to
do
with
the
mirror
or
even
the
image
my
beloved
your
smile
shall
never
fade
and
every
dawn
there
shall
appear
fresh
for
me
the
vermilion
mark
on
your
forehead
what
childish
cajolery
of
mocks
some
devil
from
his
dark
corner
silly
prattle
to
make
children
quiet
that
may
be
but
millions
and
millions
of
children
with
their
million
cries
have
to
be
kept
quiet
can
it
be
that
all
this
multitude
is
quieted
with
only
a
lie
no
my
eternal
love
can
not
deceive
me
for
she
is
true
she
is
true
that
is
why
i
have
seen
her
and
shall
see
her
so
often
even
in
my
mistakes
even
through
the
thickest
mist
of
tears
i
have
seen
her
and
lost
her
in
the
crowd
of
and
found
her
again
and
i
shall
find
her
once
more
when
i
have
escaped
through
the
loophole
of
death
ah
cruel
one
play
with
me
no
longer
if
i
have
failed
to
track
you
by
the
marks
of
your
footsteps
on
the
way
by
the
scent
of
your
tresses
lingering
in
the
air
make
me
not
weep
for
that
for
ever
the
unveiled
star
tells
me
not
to
fear
that
which
is
eternal
must
always
be
there
now
let
me
go
and
see
my
bimala
she
must
have
spread
her
tired
limbs
on
the
bed
limp
after
her
struggles
and
be
asleep
i
will
leave
a
kiss
on
her
forehead
without
waking
her
that
shall
be
the
of
my
worship
i
believe
i
could
forget
everything
after
death
all
my
mistakes
all
my
sufferings
but
some
vibration
of
the
memory
of
that
kiss
would
remain
for
the
wreath
which
is
being
woven
out
of
the
kisses
of
many
a
successive
birth
is
to
crown
the
eternal
beloved
as
the
gong
of
the
watch
rang
out
sounding
the
hour
of
two
my
came
into
the
room
whatever
are
you
doing
brother
dear
she
cried
for
pity
sake
go
to
bed
and
stop
worrying
so
i
can
not
bear
to
look
on
that
awful
shadow
of
pain
on
your
face
tears
welled
up
in
her
eyes
and
overflowed
as
she
entreated
me
thus
i
could
not
utter
a
word
but
took
the
dust
of
her
feet
as
i
went
off
to
bed
when
a
relationship
is
established
by
marriage
or
by
mutual
understanding
arising
out
of
special
friendship
or
affection
the
persons
so
related
call
each
other
in
terms
of
such
relationship
and
not
by
name
bimala
story
vii
at
first
i
suspected
nothing
feared
nothing
i
simply
felt
dedicated
to
my
country
what
a
stupendous
joy
there
was
in
this
unquestioning
surrender
verily
had
i
realized
how
in
thoroughness
of
man
can
find
supreme
bliss
for
aught
i
know
this
frenzy
of
mine
might
have
come
to
a
gradual
natural
end
but
sandip
babu
would
not
have
it
so
he
would
insist
on
revealing
himself
the
tone
of
his
voice
became
as
intimate
as
a
touch
every
look
flung
itself
on
its
knees
in
beggary
and
through
it
all
there
burned
a
passion
which
in
its
violence
made
as
though
it
would
tear
me
up
by
the
roots
and
drag
me
along
by
the
hair
i
will
not
shirk
the
truth
this
cataclysmal
desire
drew
me
by
day
and
by
night
it
seemed
desperately
alluring
this
making
havoc
of
myself
what
a
shame
it
seemed
how
terrible
and
yet
how
sweet
then
there
was
my
overpowering
curiosity
to
which
there
seemed
no
limit
he
of
whom
i
knew
but
little
who
never
could
assuredly
be
mine
whose
youth
flared
so
vigorously
in
a
hundred
points
of
flame
oh
the
mystery
of
his
seething
passions
so
immense
so
tumultuous
i
began
with
a
feeling
of
worship
but
that
soon
passed
away
i
ceased
even
to
respect
sandip
on
the
contrary
i
began
to
look
down
upon
him
nevertheless
this
lute
of
mine
fashioned
with
my
feeling
and
fancy
found
in
him
a
player
what
though
i
shrank
from
his
touch
and
even
came
to
loathe
the
lute
itself
its
music
was
conjured
up
all
the
same
i
must
confess
there
was
something
in
me
which
what
shall
i
say
which
makes
me
wish
i
could
have
died
chandranath
babu
when
he
finds
leisure
comes
to
me
he
has
the
power
to
lift
my
mind
up
to
an
eminence
from
where
i
can
see
in
a
moment
the
boundary
of
my
life
extended
on
all
sides
and
so
realize
that
the
lines
which
i
took
from
my
bounds
were
merely
imaginary
but
what
is
the
use
of
it
all
do
i
really
desire
emancipation
let
suffering
come
to
our
house
let
the
best
in
me
shrivel
up
and
become
black
but
let
this
infatuation
not
leave
me
such
seems
to
be
my
prayer
when
before
my
marriage
i
used
to
see
a
of
mine
now
dead
mad
with
drink
beating
his
wife
in
his
frenzy
and
then
sobbing
and
howling
in
maudlin
repentance
vowing
never
to
touch
liquor
again
and
yet
the
very
same
evening
sitting
down
to
drink
and
drink
it
would
fill
me
with
disgust
but
my
intoxication
today
is
still
more
fearful
the
stuff
has
not
to
be
procured
or
poured
out
it
springs
within
my
veins
and
i
know
not
how
to
resist
it
must
this
continue
to
the
end
of
my
days
now
and
again
i
start
and
look
upon
myself
and
think
my
life
to
be
a
nightmare
which
will
vanish
all
of
a
sudden
with
all
its
untruth
it
has
become
so
frightfully
incongruous
it
has
no
connection
with
its
past
what
it
is
how
it
could
have
come
to
this
pass
i
can
not
understand
one
day
my
remarked
with
a
cutting
laugh
what
a
wonderfully
hospitable
chota
rani
we
have
her
guest
absolutely
will
not
budge
in
our
time
there
used
to
be
guests
too
but
they
had
not
such
lavish
looking
after
we
were
so
absurdly
taken
up
with
our
husbands
poor
brother
nikhil
is
paying
the
penalty
of
being
born
too
modern
he
should
have
come
as
a
guest
if
he
wanted
to
stay
on
now
it
looks
as
if
it
were
time
for
him
to
quit
o
you
little
demon
do
your
glances
never
fall
by
chance
on
his
agonized
face
this
sarcasm
did
not
touch
me
for
i
knew
that
these
women
had
it
not
in
them
to
understand
the
nature
of
the
cause
of
my
devotion
i
was
then
wrapped
in
the
protecting
armour
of
the
exaltation
of
sacrifice
through
which
such
shafts
were
powerless
to
reach
and
shame
me
viii
for
some
time
all
talk
of
the
country
cause
has
been
dropped
our
conversation
nowadays
has
become
full
of
modern
and
various
other
matters
with
a
sprinkling
of
poetry
both
old
vaishnava
and
modern
english
accompanied
by
a
running
undertone
of
melody
low
down
in
the
bass
such
as
i
have
never
in
my
life
heard
before
which
seems
to
me
to
sound
the
true
manly
note
the
note
of
power
the
day
had
come
when
all
cover
was
gone
there
was
no
longer
even
the
pretence
of
a
reason
why
sandip
babu
should
linger
on
or
why
i
should
have
confidential
talks
with
him
every
now
and
then
i
felt
thoroughly
vexed
with
myself
with
my
law
with
the
ways
of
the
world
and
i
vowed
i
would
never
again
go
to
the
outer
apartments
not
if
i
were
to
die
for
it
for
two
whole
days
i
did
not
stir
out
then
for
the
first
time
i
discovered
how
far
i
had
travelled
my
life
felt
utterly
tasteless
whatever
i
touched
i
wanted
to
thrust
away
i
felt
myself
waiting
from
the
crown
of
my
head
to
the
tips
of
my
toes
waiting
for
something
somebody
my
blood
kept
tingling
with
some
expectation
i
tried
busying
myself
with
extra
work
the
bedroom
floor
was
clean
enough
but
i
insisted
on
its
being
scrubbed
over
again
under
my
eyes
things
were
arranged
in
the
cabinets
in
one
kind
of
order
i
pulled
them
all
out
and
rearranged
them
in
a
different
way
i
found
no
time
that
afternoon
even
to
do
up
my
hair
i
hurriedly
tied
it
into
a
loose
knot
and
went
and
worried
everybody
fussing
about
the
the
stores
seemed
short
and
pilfering
must
have
been
going
on
of
late
but
i
could
not
muster
up
the
courage
to
take
any
particular
person
to
task
for
might
not
the
thought
have
crossed
somebody
mind
where
were
your
eyes
all
these
days
in
short
i
behaved
that
day
as
one
possessed
the
next
day
i
tried
to
do
some
reading
what
i
read
i
have
no
idea
but
after
a
spell
of
absentmindedness
i
found
i
had
wandered
away
book
in
hand
along
the
passage
leading
towards
the
outer
apartments
and
was
standing
by
a
window
looking
out
upon
the
verandah
running
along
the
row
of
rooms
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
quadrangle
one
of
these
rooms
i
felt
had
crossed
over
to
another
shore
and
the
ferry
had
ceased
to
ply
i
felt
like
the
ghost
of
myself
of
two
days
ago
doomed
to
remain
where
i
was
and
yet
not
really
there
blankly
looking
out
for
ever
as
i
stood
there
i
saw
sandip
come
out
of
his
room
into
the
verandah
a
newspaper
in
his
hand
i
could
see
that
he
looked
extraordinarily
disturbed
the
courtyard
the
railings
in
front
seemed
to
rouse
his
wrath
he
flung
away
his
newspaper
with
a
gesture
which
seemed
to
want
to
rend
the
space
before
him
i
felt
i
could
no
longer
keep
my
vow
i
was
about
to
move
on
towards
the
when
i
found
my
behind
me
o
lord
this
beats
everything
she
ejaculated
as
she
glided
away
i
could
not
proceed
to
the
outer
apartments
the
next
morning
when
my
maid
came
calling
rani
mother
it
is
getting
late
for
giving
out
the
stores
i
flung
the
keys
to
her
saying
tell
harimati
to
see
to
it
and
went
on
with
some
embroidery
of
english
pattern
on
which
i
was
engaged
seated
near
the
window
then
came
a
servant
with
a
letter
from
sandip
babu
said
he
what
unbounded
boldness
what
must
the
messenger
have
thought
there
was
a
tremor
within
my
breast
as
i
opened
the
envelope
there
was
no
address
on
the
letter
only
the
words
urgent
matter
touching
the
cause
i
flung
aside
the
embroidery
i
was
up
on
my
feet
in
a
moment
giving
a
touch
or
two
to
my
hair
by
the
mirror
i
kept
the
i
had
on
changing
only
my
jacket
for
one
of
my
jackets
had
its
associations
i
had
to
pass
through
one
of
the
verandahs
where
my
law
used
to
sit
in
the
morning
slicing
i
refused
to
feel
awkward
whither
away
chota
rani
she
cried
to
the
outside
so
early
a
matinée
eh
and
as
i
passed
on
without
further
reply
she
hummed
after
me
a
flippant
song
ix
when
i
was
about
to
enter
the
i
saw
sandip
immersed
in
an
illustrated
catalogue
of
british
academy
pictures
with
his
back
to
the
door
he
has
a
great
notion
of
himself
as
an
expert
in
matters
of
art
one
day
my
husband
said
to
him
if
the
artists
ever
want
a
teacher
they
need
never
lack
for
one
so
long
as
you
are
there
it
had
not
been
my
husband
habit
to
speak
cuttingly
but
latterly
there
has
been
a
change
and
he
never
spares
sandip
what
makes
you
suppose
that
artists
need
no
teachers
sandip
retorted
art
is
a
creation
my
husband
replied
so
we
should
humbly
be
content
to
receive
our
lessons
about
art
from
the
work
of
the
artist
sandip
laughed
at
this
modesty
saying
you
think
that
meekness
is
a
kind
of
capital
which
increases
your
wealth
the
more
you
use
it
it
is
my
conviction
that
those
who
lack
pride
only
float
about
like
water
reeds
which
have
no
roots
in
the
soil
my
mind
used
to
be
full
of
contradictions
when
they
talked
thus
on
the
one
hand
i
was
eager
that
my
husband
should
win
in
argument
and
that
sandip
pride
should
be
shamed
yet
on
the
other
it
was
sandip
unabashed
pride
which
attracted
me
so
it
shone
like
a
precious
diamond
which
knows
no
diffidence
and
sparkles
in
the
face
of
the
sun
itself
i
entered
the
room
i
knew
sandip
could
hear
my
footsteps
as
i
went
forward
but
he
pretended
not
to
and
kept
his
eyes
on
the
book
i
dreaded
his
art
talks
for
i
could
not
overcome
my
delicacy
about
the
pictures
he
talked
of
and
the
things
he
said
and
had
much
ado
in
putting
on
an
air
of
overdone
insensibility
to
hide
my
qualms
so
i
was
almost
on
the
point
of
retracing
my
steps
when
with
a
deep
sigh
sandip
raised
his
eyes
and
affected
to
be
startled
at
the
sight
of
me
ah
you
have
come
he
said
in
his
words
in
his
tone
in
his
eyes
there
was
a
world
of
suppressed
reproach
as
if
the
claims
he
had
acquired
over
me
made
my
absence
even
for
these
two
or
three
days
a
grievous
wrong
i
knew
this
attitude
was
an
insult
to
me
but
alas
i
had
not
the
power
to
resent
it
i
made
no
reply
but
though
i
was
looking
another
way
i
could
not
help
feeling
that
sandip
plaintive
gaze
had
planted
itself
right
on
my
face
and
would
take
no
denial
i
did
so
wish
he
would
say
something
so
that
i
could
shelter
myself
behind
his
words
i
can
not
tell
how
long
this
went
on
but
at
last
i
could
stand
it
no
longer
what
is
this
matter
i
asked
you
are
wanting
to
tell
me
about
sandip
again
affected
surprise
as
he
said
must
there
always
be
some
matter
is
friendship
by
itself
a
crime
oh
queen
bee
to
think
that
you
should
make
so
light
of
the
greatest
thing
on
earth
is
the
heart
worship
to
be
shut
out
like
a
stray
cur
there
was
again
that
tremor
within
me
i
could
feel
the
crisis
coming
too
importunate
to
be
put
off
joy
and
fear
struggled
for
the
mastery
would
my
shoulders
i
wondered
be
broad
enough
to
stand
its
shock
or
would
it
not
leave
me
overthrown
with
my
face
in
the
dust
i
was
trembling
all
over
steadying
myself
with
an
effort
i
repeated
you
summoned
me
for
something
touching
the
cause
so
i
have
left
my
household
duties
to
attend
to
it
that
is
just
what
i
was
trying
to
explain
he
said
with
a
dry
laugh
do
you
not
know
that
i
come
to
worship
have
i
not
told
you
that
in
you
i
visualize
the
of
our
country
the
geography
of
a
country
is
not
the
whole
truth
no
one
can
give
up
his
life
for
a
map
when
i
see
you
before
me
then
only
do
i
realize
how
lovely
my
country
is
when
you
have
anointed
me
with
your
own
hands
then
shall
i
know
i
have
the
sanction
of
my
country
and
if
with
that
in
my
heart
i
fall
fighting
it
shall
not
be
on
the
dust
of
some
land
but
on
a
lovingly
spread
skirt
do
you
know
what
kind
of
skirt
like
that
of
the
you
wore
the
other
day
with
a
broad
border
can
i
ever
forget
it
such
are
the
visions
which
give
vigour
to
life
and
joy
to
death
sandip
eyes
took
fire
as
he
went
on
but
whether
it
was
the
fire
of
worship
or
of
passion
i
could
not
tell
i
was
reminded
of
the
day
on
which
i
first
heard
him
speak
when
i
could
not
be
sure
whether
he
was
a
person
or
just
a
living
flame
i
had
not
the
power
to
utter
a
word
you
can
not
take
shelter
behind
the
walls
of
decorum
when
in
a
moment
the
fire
leaps
up
and
with
the
flash
of
its
sword
and
the
roar
of
its
laughter
destroys
all
the
miser
stores
i
was
in
terror
lest
he
should
forget
himself
and
take
me
by
the
hand
for
he
shook
like
a
quivering
tongue
of
fire
his
eyes
showered
scorching
sparks
on
me
are
you
for
ever
determined
he
cried
after
a
pause
to
make
gods
of
your
petty
household
duties
you
who
have
it
in
you
to
send
us
to
life
or
to
death
is
this
power
of
yours
to
be
kept
veiled
in
a
zenana
cast
away
all
false
shame
i
pray
you
snap
your
fingers
at
the
whispering
around
take
your
plunge
today
into
the
freedom
of
the
outer
world
when
in
sandip
appeals
his
worship
of
the
country
gets
to
be
subtly
interwoven
with
his
worship
of
me
then
does
my
blood
dance
indeed
and
the
barriers
of
my
hesitation
totter
his
talks
about
art
and
sex
his
distinctions
between
real
and
unreal
had
but
clogged
my
attempts
at
response
with
some
revolting
nastiness
this
however
now
burst
again
into
a
glow
before
which
my
repugnance
faded
away
i
felt
that
my
resplendent
womanhood
made
me
indeed
a
goddess
why
should
not
its
glory
flash
from
my
forehead
with
visible
brilliance
why
does
not
my
voice
find
a
word
some
audible
cry
which
would
be
like
a
sacred
spell
to
my
country
for
its
fire
initiation
all
of
a
sudden
my
maid
khema
rushed
into
the
room
dishevelled
give
me
my
wages
and
let
me
go
she
screamed
never
in
all
my
life
have
i
been
so
the
rest
of
her
speech
was
drowned
in
sobs
what
is
the
matter
thako
the
bara
rani
maid
it
appeared
had
for
no
rhyme
or
reason
reviled
her
in
unmeasured
terms
she
was
in
such
a
state
it
was
no
manner
of
use
trying
to
pacify
her
by
saying
i
would
look
into
the
matter
afterwards
the
slime
of
domestic
life
that
lay
beneath
the
lotus
bank
of
womanhood
came
to
the
surface
rather
than
allow
sandip
a
prolonged
vision
of
it
i
had
to
hurry
back
within
x
my
was
absorbed
in
her
the
suspicion
of
a
smile
playing
about
her
lips
as
if
nothing
untoward
had
happened
she
was
still
humming
the
same
song
why
has
your
thako
been
calling
poor
khema
names
i
burst
out
indeed
the
wretch
i
will
have
her
broomed
out
of
the
house
what
a
shame
to
spoil
your
morning
out
like
this
as
for
khema
where
are
the
hussy
manners
to
go
and
disturb
you
when
you
are
engaged
anyhow
chota
rani
do
you
worry
yourself
with
these
domestic
squabbles
leave
them
to
me
and
return
to
your
friend
how
suddenly
the
wind
in
the
sails
of
our
mind
veers
round
this
going
to
meet
sandip
outside
seemed
in
the
light
of
the
zenana
code
such
an
extraordinarily
thing
to
do
that
i
went
off
to
my
own
room
at
a
loss
for
a
reply
i
knew
this
was
my
doing
and
that
she
had
egged
her
maid
on
to
contrive
this
scene
but
i
had
brought
myself
to
such
an
unstable
poise
that
i
dared
not
have
my
fling
why
it
was
only
the
other
day
that
i
found
i
could
not
keep
up
to
the
last
the
unbending
hauteur
with
which
i
had
demanded
from
my
husband
the
dismissal
of
the
man
nanku
i
felt
suddenly
abashed
when
the
bara
rani
came
up
and
said
it
is
really
all
my
fault
brother
dear
we
are
folk
and
i
did
not
quite
like
the
ways
of
your
sandip
babu
so
i
only
told
the
guard
but
how
was
i
to
know
that
our
chota
rani
would
take
this
as
an
insult
i
thought
it
would
be
the
other
way
about
just
my
incorrigible
silliness
the
thing
which
seems
so
glorious
when
viewed
from
the
heights
of
the
country
cause
looks
so
muddy
when
seen
from
the
bottom
one
begins
by
getting
angry
and
then
feels
disgusted
i
shut
myself
into
my
room
sitting
by
the
window
thinking
how
easy
life
would
be
if
only
one
could
keep
in
harmony
with
surroundings
how
simply
the
senior
rani
sits
in
her
verandah
with
her
and
how
inaccessible
to
me
has
become
my
natural
seat
beside
my
daily
duties
where
will
it
all
end
i
asked
myself
shall
i
ever
recover
as
from
a
delirium
and
forget
it
all
or
am
i
to
be
dragged
to
depths
from
which
there
can
be
no
escape
in
this
life
how
on
earth
did
i
manage
to
let
my
good
fortune
escape
me
and
spoil
my
life
so
every
wall
of
this
bedroom
of
mine
which
i
first
entered
nine
years
ago
as
a
bride
stares
at
me
in
dismay
when
my
husband
came
home
after
his
examination
he
brought
for
me
this
orchid
belonging
to
some
land
beyond
the
seas
from
beneath
these
few
little
leaves
sprang
such
a
cascade
of
blossoms
it
looked
as
if
they
were
pouring
forth
from
some
overturned
urn
of
beauty
we
decided
together
to
hang
it
here
over
this
window
it
flowered
only
that
once
but
we
have
always
been
in
hope
of
its
doing
so
once
more
curiously
enough
i
have
kept
on
watering
it
these
days
from
force
of
habit
and
it
is
still
green
it
is
now
four
years
since
i
framed
a
photograph
of
my
husband
in
ivory
and
put
it
in
the
niche
over
there
if
i
happen
to
look
that
way
i
have
to
lower
my
eyes
up
to
last
week
i
used
regularly
to
put
there
the
flowers
of
my
worship
every
morning
after
my
bath
my
husband
has
often
chided
me
over
this
it
shames
me
to
see
you
place
me
on
a
height
to
which
i
do
not
belong
he
said
one
day
what
nonsense
i
am
not
only
ashamed
but
also
jealous
just
hear
him
jealous
of
whom
pray
of
that
false
me
it
only
shows
that
i
am
too
petty
for
you
that
you
want
some
extraordinary
man
who
can
overpower
you
with
his
superiority
and
so
you
needs
must
take
refuge
in
making
for
yourself
another
this
kind
of
talk
only
makes
me
angry
said
i
what
is
the
use
of
being
angry
with
me
he
replied
blame
your
fate
which
allowed
you
no
choice
but
made
you
take
me
blindfold
this
keeps
you
trying
to
retrieve
its
blunder
by
making
me
out
a
paragon
i
felt
so
hurt
at
the
bare
idea
that
tears
started
to
my
eyes
that
day
and
whenever
i
think
of
that
now
i
can
not
raise
my
eyes
to
the
niche
for
now
there
is
another
photograph
in
my
jewel
case
the
other
day
when
arranging
the
i
brought
away
that
double
photo
frame
the
one
in
which
sandip
portrait
was
next
to
my
husband
to
this
portrait
i
have
no
flowers
of
worship
to
offer
but
it
remains
hidden
away
under
my
gems
it
has
all
the
greater
fascination
because
kept
secret
i
look
at
it
now
and
then
with
doors
closed
at
night
i
turn
up
the
lamp
and
sit
with
it
in
my
hand
gazing
and
gazing
and
every
night
i
think
of
burning
it
in
the
flame
of
the
lamp
to
be
done
with
it
for
ever
but
every
night
i
heave
a
sigh
and
smother
it
again
in
my
pearls
and
diamonds
ah
wretched
woman
what
a
wealth
of
love
was
twined
round
each
one
of
those
jewels
oh
why
am
i
not
dead
sandip
had
impressed
it
on
me
that
hesitation
is
not
in
the
nature
of
woman
for
her
neither
right
nor
left
has
any
existence
she
only
moves
forward
when
the
women
of
our
country
wake
up
he
repeatedly
insisted
their
voice
will
be
unmistakably
confident
in
its
utterance
of
the
cry
i
want
i
want
sandip
went
on
one
day
this
was
the
primal
word
at
the
root
of
all
creation
it
had
no
maxim
to
guide
it
but
it
became
fire
and
wrought
itself
into
suns
and
stars
its
partiality
is
terrible
because
it
had
a
desire
for
man
it
ruthlessly
sacrificed
millions
of
beasts
for
millions
of
years
to
achieve
that
desire
that
terrible
word
i
want
has
taken
flesh
in
woman
and
therefore
men
who
are
cowards
try
with
all
their
might
to
keep
back
this
primeval
flood
with
their
earthen
dykes
they
are
afraid
lest
laughing
and
dancing
as
it
goes
it
should
wash
away
all
the
hedges
and
props
of
their
pumpkin
field
men
in
every
age
flatter
themselves
that
they
have
secured
this
force
within
the
bounds
of
their
convenience
but
it
gathers
and
grows
now
it
is
calm
and
deep
like
a
lake
but
gradually
its
pressure
will
increase
the
dykes
will
give
way
and
the
force
which
has
so
long
been
dumb
will
rush
forward
with
the
roar
i
want
these
words
of
sandip
echo
in
my
like
a
they
shame
into
silence
all
my
conflicts
with
myself
what
do
i
care
what
people
may
think
of
me
of
what
value
are
that
orchid
and
that
niche
in
my
bedroom
what
power
have
they
to
belittle
me
to
put
me
to
shame
the
primal
fire
of
creation
burns
in
me
i
felt
a
strong
desire
to
snatch
down
the
orchid
and
fling
it
out
of
the
window
to
denude
the
niche
of
its
picture
to
lay
bare
and
naked
the
unashamed
spirit
of
destruction
that
raged
within
me
my
arm
was
raised
to
do
it
but
a
sudden
pang
passed
through
my
breast
tears
started
to
my
eyes
i
threw
myself
down
and
sobbed
what
is
the
end
of
all
this
what
is
the
end
sandip
story
iv
when
i
read
these
pages
of
the
story
of
my
life
i
seriously
question
myself
is
this
sandip
am
i
made
of
words
am
i
merely
a
book
with
a
covering
of
flesh
and
blood
the
earth
is
not
a
dead
thing
like
the
moon
she
breathes
her
rivers
and
oceans
send
up
vapours
in
which
she
is
clothed
she
is
covered
with
a
mantle
of
her
own
dust
which
flies
about
the
air
the
onlooker
gazing
upon
the
earth
from
the
outside
can
see
only
the
light
reflected
from
this
vapour
and
this
dust
the
tracks
of
the
mighty
continents
are
not
distinctly
visible
the
man
who
is
alive
as
this
earth
is
is
likewise
always
enveloped
in
the
mist
of
the
ideas
which
he
is
breathing
out
his
real
land
and
water
remain
hidden
and
he
appears
to
be
made
of
only
lights
and
shadows
it
seems
to
me
in
this
story
of
my
life
that
like
a
living
plant
i
am
displaying
the
picture
of
an
ideal
world
but
i
am
not
merely
what
i
want
what
i
think
i
am
also
what
i
do
not
love
what
i
do
not
wish
to
be
my
creation
had
begun
before
i
was
born
i
had
no
choice
in
regard
to
my
surroundings
and
so
must
make
the
best
of
such
material
as
comes
to
my
hand
my
theory
of
life
makes
me
certain
that
the
great
is
cruel
to
be
just
is
for
ordinary
men
it
is
reserved
for
the
great
to
be
unjust
the
surface
of
the
earth
was
even
the
volcano
butted
it
with
its
fiery
horn
and
found
its
own
eminence
its
justice
was
not
towards
its
obstacle
but
towards
itself
successful
injustice
and
genuine
cruelty
have
been
the
only
forces
by
which
individual
or
nation
has
become
millionaire
or
monarch
that
is
why
i
preach
the
great
discipline
of
injustice
i
say
to
everyone
deliverance
is
based
upon
injustice
injustice
is
the
fire
which
must
keep
on
burning
something
in
order
to
save
itself
from
becoming
ashes
whenever
an
individual
or
nation
becomes
incapable
of
perpetrating
injustice
it
is
swept
into
the
of
the
world
as
yet
this
is
only
my
idea
it
is
not
completely
myself
there
are
rifts
in
the
armour
through
which
something
peeps
out
which
is
extremely
soft
and
sensitive
because
as
i
say
the
best
part
of
myself
was
created
before
i
came
to
this
stage
of
existence
from
time
to
time
i
try
my
followers
in
their
lesson
of
cruelty
one
day
we
went
on
a
picnic
a
goat
was
grazing
by
i
asked
them
who
is
there
among
you
that
can
cut
off
a
leg
of
that
goat
alive
with
this
knife
and
bring
it
to
me
while
they
all
hesitated
i
went
myself
and
did
it
one
of
them
fainted
at
the
sight
but
when
they
saw
me
unmoved
they
took
the
dust
of
my
feet
saying
that
i
was
above
all
human
weaknesses
that
is
to
say
they
saw
that
day
the
vaporous
envelope
which
was
my
idea
but
failed
to
perceive
the
inner
me
which
by
a
curious
freak
of
fate
has
been
created
tender
and
merciful
in
the
present
chapter
of
my
life
which
is
growing
in
interest
every
day
round
bimala
and
nikhil
there
is
also
much
that
remains
hidden
underneath
this
malady
of
ideas
which
afflicts
me
is
shaping
my
life
within
nevertheless
a
great
part
of
my
life
remains
outside
its
influence
and
so
there
is
set
up
a
discrepancy
between
my
outward
life
and
its
inner
design
which
i
try
my
best
to
keep
concealed
even
from
myself
otherwise
it
may
wreck
not
only
my
plans
but
my
very
life
life
is
indefinite
a
bundle
of
contradictions
we
men
with
our
ideas
strive
to
give
it
a
particular
shape
by
melting
it
into
a
particular
mould
into
the
definiteness
of
success
all
the
from
alexander
down
to
the
american
millionaires
mould
themselves
into
a
sword
or
a
mint
and
thus
find
that
distinct
image
of
themselves
which
is
the
source
of
their
success
the
chief
controversy
between
nikhil
and
myself
arises
from
this
that
though
i
say
know
thyself
and
nikhil
also
says
know
thyself
his
interpretation
makes
this
knowing
tantamount
to
not
knowing
winning
your
kind
of
success
nikhil
once
objected
is
success
gained
at
the
cost
of
the
soul
but
the
soul
is
greater
than
success
i
simply
said
in
answer
your
words
are
too
vague
that
i
can
not
help
nikhil
replied
a
machine
is
distinct
enough
but
not
so
life
if
to
gain
distinctness
you
try
to
know
life
as
a
machine
then
such
mere
distinctness
can
not
stand
for
truth
the
soul
is
not
as
distinct
as
success
and
so
you
only
lose
your
soul
if
you
seek
it
in
your
success
where
then
is
this
wonderful
soul
where
it
knows
itself
in
the
infinite
and
transcends
its
success
but
how
does
all
this
apply
to
our
work
for
the
country
it
is
the
same
thing
where
our
country
makes
itself
the
final
object
it
gains
success
at
the
cost
of
the
soul
where
it
recognizes
the
greatest
as
greater
than
all
there
it
may
miss
success
but
gains
its
soul
is
there
any
example
of
this
in
history
man
is
so
great
that
he
can
despise
not
only
the
success
but
also
the
example
possibly
example
is
lacking
just
as
there
is
no
example
of
the
flower
in
the
seed
but
there
is
the
urgence
of
the
flower
in
the
seed
all
the
same
it
is
not
that
i
do
not
at
all
understand
nikhil
point
of
view
that
is
rather
where
my
danger
lies
i
was
born
in
india
and
the
poison
of
its
spirituality
runs
in
my
blood
however
loudly
i
may
proclaim
the
madness
of
walking
in
the
path
of
abnegation
i
can
not
avoid
it
altogether
this
is
exactly
how
such
curious
anomalies
happen
nowadays
in
our
country
we
must
have
our
religion
and
also
our
nationalism
our
and
also
our
the
result
is
that
both
of
them
suffer
it
is
like
performing
with
an
english
military
band
side
by
side
with
our
indian
festive
pipes
i
must
make
it
the
purpose
of
my
life
to
put
an
end
to
this
hideous
confusion
i
want
the
western
military
style
to
prevail
not
the
indian
we
shall
then
not
be
ashamed
of
the
flag
of
our
passion
which
mother
nature
has
sent
with
us
as
our
standard
into
the
battlefield
of
life
passion
is
beautiful
and
pure
pure
as
the
lily
that
comes
out
of
the
slimy
soil
it
rises
superior
to
its
defilement
and
needs
no
pears
soap
to
wash
it
clean
v
a
question
has
been
worrying
me
the
last
few
days
why
am
i
allowing
my
life
to
become
entangled
with
bimala
am
i
a
drifting
log
to
be
caught
up
at
any
and
every
obstacle
not
that
i
have
any
false
shame
at
bimala
becoming
an
object
of
my
desire
it
is
only
too
clear
how
she
wants
me
and
so
i
look
on
her
as
quite
legitimately
mine
the
fruit
hangs
on
the
branch
by
the
stem
but
that
is
no
reason
why
the
claim
of
the
stem
should
be
eternal
ripe
fruit
can
not
for
ever
swear
by
its
slackening
all
its
sweetness
has
been
accumulated
for
me
to
surrender
itself
to
my
hand
is
the
reason
of
its
existence
its
very
nature
its
true
morality
so
i
must
pluck
it
for
it
becomes
me
not
to
make
it
futile
but
what
is
teasing
me
is
that
i
am
getting
entangled
am
i
not
born
to
rule
to
bestride
my
proper
steed
the
crowd
and
drive
it
as
i
will
the
reins
in
my
hand
the
destination
known
only
to
me
and
for
it
the
thorns
the
mire
on
the
road
this
steed
now
awaits
me
at
the
door
pawing
and
champing
its
bit
its
neighing
filling
the
skies
but
where
am
i
and
what
am
i
about
letting
day
after
day
of
golden
opportunity
slip
by
i
used
to
think
i
was
like
a
storm
that
the
torn
flowers
with
which
i
strewed
my
path
would
not
impede
my
progress
but
i
am
only
wandering
round
and
round
a
flower
like
a
bee
not
a
storm
so
as
i
was
saying
the
colouring
of
ideas
which
man
gives
himself
is
only
superficial
the
inner
man
remains
as
ordinary
as
ever
if
someone
who
could
see
right
into
me
were
to
write
my
biography
he
would
make
me
out
to
be
no
different
from
that
lout
of
a
panchu
or
even
from
nikhil
last
night
i
was
turning
over
the
pages
of
my
old
diary
i
had
just
graduated
and
my
brain
was
bursting
with
philosophy
even
so
early
i
had
vowed
not
to
harbour
any
illusions
whether
of
my
own
or
other
imagining
but
to
build
my
life
on
a
solid
basis
of
reality
but
what
has
since
been
its
actual
story
where
is
its
solidity
it
has
rather
been
a
network
where
though
the
thread
be
continuous
more
space
is
taken
up
by
the
holes
fight
as
i
may
these
will
not
own
defeat
just
as
i
was
congratulating
myself
on
steadily
following
the
thread
here
i
am
badly
caught
in
a
hole
for
i
have
become
susceptible
to
compunctions
i
want
it
it
is
here
let
me
take
it
this
is
a
straightforward
policy
those
who
can
pursue
its
course
with
vigour
needs
must
win
through
in
the
end
but
the
gods
would
not
have
it
that
such
journey
should
be
easy
so
they
have
deputed
the
siren
sympathy
to
distract
the
wayfarer
to
dim
his
vision
with
her
tearful
mist
i
can
see
that
poor
bimala
is
struggling
like
a
snared
deer
what
a
piteous
alarm
there
is
in
her
eyes
how
she
is
torn
with
straining
at
her
bonds
this
sight
of
course
should
gladden
the
heart
of
a
true
hunter
and
so
do
i
rejoice
but
then
i
am
also
touched
and
therefore
i
dally
and
standing
on
the
brink
i
am
hesitating
to
pull
the
noose
fast
there
have
been
moments
i
know
when
i
could
have
bounded
up
to
her
clasped
her
hands
and
folded
her
to
my
breast
unresisting
had
i
done
so
she
would
not
have
said
one
word
she
was
aware
that
some
crisis
was
impending
which
in
a
moment
would
change
the
meaning
of
the
whole
world
standing
before
that
cavern
of
the
incalculable
but
yet
expected
her
face
went
pale
and
her
eyes
glowed
with
a
fearful
ecstasy
within
that
moment
when
it
arrives
an
eternity
will
take
shape
which
our
destiny
awaits
holding
its
breath
but
i
have
let
this
moment
slip
by
i
did
not
with
uncompromising
strength
press
the
almost
certain
into
the
absolutely
assured
i
now
see
clearly
that
some
hidden
elements
in
my
nature
have
openly
ranged
themselves
as
obstacles
in
my
path
that
is
exactly
how
ravana
whom
i
look
upon
as
the
real
hero
of
the
met
with
his
doom
he
kept
sita
in
his
asoka
garden
awaiting
her
pleasure
instead
of
taking
her
straight
into
his
harem
this
weak
spot
in
his
otherwise
grand
character
made
the
whole
of
the
abduction
episode
futile
another
such
touch
of
compunction
made
him
disregard
and
be
lenient
to
his
traitorous
brother
bibhisan
only
to
get
himself
killed
for
his
pains
thus
does
the
tragic
in
life
come
by
its
own
in
the
beginning
it
lies
a
little
thing
in
some
dark
and
ends
by
overthrowing
the
whole
superstructure
the
real
tragedy
is
that
man
does
not
know
himself
for
what
he
really
is
vi
then
again
there
is
nikhil
crank
though
he
be
laugh
at
him
as
i
may
i
can
not
get
rid
of
the
idea
that
he
is
my
friend
at
first
i
gave
no
thought
to
his
point
of
view
but
of
late
it
has
begun
to
shame
and
hurt
me
therefore
i
have
been
trying
to
talk
and
argue
with
him
in
the
same
enthusiastic
way
as
of
old
but
it
does
not
ring
true
it
is
even
leading
me
at
times
into
such
a
length
of
unnaturalness
as
to
pretend
to
agree
with
him
but
such
hypocrisy
is
not
in
my
nature
nor
in
that
of
nikhil
either
this
at
least
is
something
we
have
in
common
that
is
why
nowadays
i
would
rather
not
come
across
him
and
have
taken
to
fighting
shy
of
his
presence
all
these
are
signs
of
weakness
no
sooner
is
the
possibility
of
a
wrong
admitted
than
it
becomes
actual
and
clutches
you
by
the
throat
however
you
may
then
try
to
shake
off
all
belief
in
it
what
i
should
like
to
be
able
to
tell
nikhil
frankly
is
that
happenings
such
as
these
must
be
looked
in
the
face
as
great
realities
and
that
which
is
the
truth
should
not
be
allowed
to
stand
between
true
friends
there
is
no
denying
that
i
have
really
weakened
it
was
not
this
weakness
which
won
over
bimala
she
burnt
her
wings
in
the
blaze
of
the
full
strength
of
my
unhesitating
manliness
whenever
smoke
obscures
its
lustre
she
also
becomes
confused
and
draws
back
then
comes
a
thorough
revulsion
of
feeling
and
she
fain
would
take
back
the
garland
she
has
put
round
my
neck
but
can
not
and
so
she
only
closes
her
eyes
to
shut
it
out
of
sight
but
all
the
same
i
must
not
swerve
from
the
path
i
have
chalked
out
it
would
never
do
to
abandon
the
cause
of
the
country
especially
at
the
present
time
i
shall
simply
make
bimala
one
with
my
country
the
turbulent
west
wind
which
has
swept
away
the
country
veil
of
conscience
will
sweep
away
the
veil
of
the
wife
from
bimala
face
and
in
that
uncovering
there
will
be
no
shame
the
ship
will
rock
as
it
bears
the
crowd
across
the
ocean
flying
the
pennant
of
and
it
will
serve
as
the
cradle
to
my
power
as
well
as
to
my
love
bimala
will
see
such
a
majestic
vision
of
deliverance
that
her
bonds
will
slip
from
about
her
without
shame
without
her
even
being
aware
of
it
fascinated
by
the
beauty
of
this
terrible
wrecking
power
she
will
not
hesitate
a
moment
to
be
cruel
i
have
seen
in
bimala
nature
the
cruelty
which
is
the
inherent
force
of
existence
the
cruelty
which
with
its
unrelenting
might
keeps
the
world
beautiful
if
only
women
could
be
set
free
from
the
artificial
fetters
put
round
them
by
men
we
could
see
on
earth
the
living
image
of
kali
the
shameless
pitiless
goddess
i
am
a
worshipper
of
kali
and
one
day
i
shall
truly
worship
her
setting
bimala
on
her
altar
of
destruction
for
this
let
me
get
ready
the
way
of
retreat
is
absolutely
closed
for
both
of
us
we
shall
despoil
each
other
get
to
hate
each
other
but
never
more
be
free
chapter
five
nikhil
story
iv
everything
is
rippling
and
waving
with
the
flood
of
august
the
young
shoots
of
rice
have
the
sheen
of
an
infant
limbs
the
water
has
invaded
the
garden
next
to
our
house
the
morning
light
like
the
love
of
the
blue
sky
is
lavished
upon
the
earth
why
can
not
i
sing
the
water
of
the
distant
river
is
shimmering
with
light
the
leaves
are
glistening
the
fields
with
their
fitful
shivers
break
into
gleams
of
gold
and
in
this
symphony
of
autumn
only
i
remain
voiceless
the
sunshine
of
the
world
strikes
my
heart
but
is
not
reflected
back
when
i
realize
the
lack
of
expressiveness
in
myself
i
know
why
i
am
deprived
who
could
bear
my
company
day
and
night
without
a
break
bimala
is
full
of
the
energy
of
life
and
so
she
has
never
become
stale
to
me
for
a
moment
in
all
these
nine
years
of
our
wedded
life
my
life
has
only
its
dumb
depths
but
no
murmuring
rush
i
can
only
receive
not
impart
movement
and
therefore
my
company
is
like
fasting
i
recognize
clearly
today
that
bimala
has
been
languishing
because
of
a
famine
of
companionship
then
whom
shall
i
blame
like
vidyapati
i
can
only
lament
it
is
august
the
sky
breaks
into
a
passionate
rain
alas
empty
is
my
house
my
house
i
now
see
was
built
to
remain
empty
because
its
doors
can
not
open
but
i
never
knew
till
now
that
its
divinity
had
been
sitting
outside
i
had
fondly
believed
that
she
had
accepted
my
sacrifice
and
granted
in
return
her
boon
but
alas
my
house
has
all
along
been
empty
every
year
about
this
time
it
was
our
practice
to
go
in
a
over
the
broads
of
samalda
i
used
to
tell
bimala
that
a
song
must
come
back
to
its
refrain
over
and
over
again
the
original
refrain
of
every
song
is
in
nature
where
the
laden
wind
passes
over
the
rippling
stream
where
the
green
earth
drawing
its
over
its
face
keeps
its
ear
close
to
the
speaking
water
there
at
the
beginning
of
time
a
man
and
a
woman
first
met
not
within
walls
and
therefore
we
two
must
come
back
to
nature
at
least
once
a
year
to
tune
our
love
anew
to
the
first
pure
note
of
the
meeting
of
hearts
the
first
two
anniversaries
of
our
married
life
i
spent
in
calcutta
where
i
went
through
my
examinations
but
from
the
next
year
onwards
for
seven
years
without
a
break
we
have
celebrated
our
union
among
the
blossoming
now
begins
the
next
octave
of
my
life
it
was
difficult
for
me
to
ignore
the
fact
that
the
same
month
of
august
had
come
round
again
this
year
does
bimala
remember
it
i
wonder
she
has
given
me
no
reminder
everything
is
mute
about
me
it
is
august
the
sky
breaks
into
a
passionate
rain
alas
empty
is
my
house
the
house
which
becomes
empty
through
the
parting
of
lovers
still
has
music
left
in
the
heart
of
its
emptiness
but
the
house
that
is
empty
because
hearts
are
asunder
is
awful
in
its
silence
even
the
cry
of
pain
is
out
of
place
there
this
cry
of
pain
must
be
silenced
in
me
so
long
as
i
continue
to
suffer
bimala
will
never
have
true
freedom
i
must
free
her
completely
otherwise
i
shall
never
gain
my
freedom
from
untruth
i
think
i
have
come
to
the
verge
of
understanding
one
thing
man
has
so
fanned
the
flame
of
the
loves
of
men
and
women
as
to
make
it
overpass
its
rightful
domain
and
now
even
in
the
name
of
humanity
itself
he
can
not
bring
it
back
under
control
worship
has
idolized
his
passion
but
there
must
be
no
more
human
sacrifices
at
its
shrine
i
went
into
my
bedroom
this
morning
to
fetch
a
book
it
is
long
since
i
have
been
there
in
the
a
pang
passed
through
me
as
i
looked
round
it
today
in
the
morning
light
on
the
clothes
rack
was
hanging
a
of
bimala
crinkled
ready
for
wear
on
the
were
her
perfumes
her
comb
her
and
with
them
still
her
vermilion
box
underneath
were
her
tiny
slippers
once
in
the
old
days
when
bimala
had
not
yet
overcome
her
objections
to
shoes
i
had
got
these
out
from
lucknow
to
tempt
her
the
first
time
she
was
ready
to
drop
for
very
shame
to
go
in
them
even
from
the
room
to
the
verandah
since
then
she
has
worn
out
many
shoes
but
has
treasured
up
this
pair
when
first
showing
her
the
slippers
i
chaffed
her
over
a
curious
practice
of
hers
i
have
caught
you
taking
the
dust
of
my
feet
thinking
me
asleep
these
are
the
offerings
of
my
worship
to
ward
the
dust
off
the
feet
of
my
wakeful
divinity
you
must
not
say
such
things
she
protested
or
i
will
never
wear
your
shoes
this
bedroom
of
mine
it
has
a
subtle
atmosphere
which
goes
straight
to
my
heart
i
was
never
aware
as
i
am
today
how
my
thirsting
heart
has
been
sending
out
its
roots
to
cling
round
each
and
every
familiar
object
the
severing
of
the
main
root
i
see
is
not
enough
to
set
life
free
even
these
little
slippers
serve
to
hold
one
back
my
wandering
eyes
fall
on
the
niche
my
portrait
there
is
looking
the
same
as
ever
in
spite
of
the
flowers
scattered
round
it
having
been
withered
black
of
all
the
things
in
the
room
their
greeting
strikes
me
as
sincere
they
are
still
here
simply
because
it
was
not
felt
worth
while
even
to
remove
them
never
mind
let
me
welcome
truth
albeit
in
such
sere
and
sorry
garb
and
look
forward
to
the
time
when
i
shall
be
able
to
do
so
unmoved
as
does
my
photograph
as
i
stood
there
bimal
came
in
from
behind
i
hastily
turned
my
eyes
from
the
niche
to
the
shelves
as
i
muttered
i
came
to
get
amiel
journal
what
need
had
ito
volunteer
an
explanation
i
felt
like
a
a
trespasser
prying
into
a
secret
not
meant
for
me
i
could
not
look
bimal
in
the
face
but
hurried
away
v
i
had
just
made
the
discovery
that
it
was
useless
to
keep
up
a
pretence
of
reading
in
my
room
outside
and
also
that
it
was
equally
beyond
me
to
busy
myself
attending
to
anything
at
all
so
that
all
the
days
of
my
future
bid
fair
to
congeal
into
one
solid
mass
and
settle
heavily
on
my
breast
for
good
when
panchu
the
tenant
of
a
neighbouring
came
up
to
me
with
a
basketful
of
and
greeted
me
with
a
profound
obeisance
well
panchu
said
i
what
is
all
this
for
i
had
got
to
know
panchu
through
my
master
he
was
extremely
poor
nor
was
i
in
a
position
to
do
anything
for
him
so
i
supposed
this
present
was
intended
to
procure
a
tip
to
help
the
poor
fellow
to
make
both
ends
meet
i
took
some
money
from
my
purse
and
held
it
out
towards
him
but
with
folded
hands
he
protested
i
can
not
take
that
sir
why
what
is
the
matter
let
me
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
sir
once
when
i
was
hard
pressed
i
stole
some
from
the
garden
here
i
am
getting
old
and
may
die
any
day
so
i
have
come
to
pay
them
back
amiel
journal
could
not
have
done
me
any
good
that
day
but
these
words
of
panchu
lightened
my
heart
there
are
more
things
in
life
than
the
union
or
separation
of
man
and
woman
the
great
world
stretches
far
beyond
and
one
can
truly
measure
one
joys
and
sorrows
when
standing
in
its
midst
panchu
was
devoted
to
my
master
i
know
well
enough
how
he
manages
to
eke
out
a
livelihood
he
is
up
before
dawn
every
day
and
with
a
basket
of
leaves
twists
of
tobacco
coloured
cotton
yarn
little
combs
and
other
trinkets
beloved
of
the
village
women
he
wades
through
the
deep
water
of
the
marsh
and
goes
over
to
the
namasudra
quarters
there
he
barters
his
goods
for
rice
which
fetches
him
a
little
more
than
their
price
in
money
if
he
can
get
back
soon
enough
he
goes
out
again
after
a
hurried
meal
to
the
sweetmeat
seller
where
he
assists
in
beating
sugar
for
wafers
as
soon
as
he
comes
home
he
sits
at
his
making
plodding
on
often
till
midnight
all
this
cruel
toil
does
not
earn
for
himself
and
his
family
a
bare
two
meals
a
day
during
much
more
than
half
the
year
his
method
of
eating
is
to
begin
with
a
good
filling
draught
of
water
and
his
staple
food
is
the
cheapest
kind
of
seedy
banana
and
yet
the
family
has
to
go
with
only
one
meal
a
day
for
the
rest
of
the
year
at
one
time
i
had
an
idea
of
making
him
a
charity
allowance
but
said
my
master
your
gift
may
destroy
the
man
it
can
not
destroy
the
hardship
of
his
lot
mother
bengal
has
not
only
this
one
panchu
if
the
milk
in
her
breasts
has
run
dry
that
can
not
be
supplied
from
the
outside
these
are
thoughts
which
give
one
pause
and
i
decided
to
devote
myself
to
working
it
out
that
very
day
i
said
to
bimal
let
us
dedicate
our
lives
to
removing
the
root
of
this
sorrow
in
our
country
you
are
my
prince
siddharta
i
see
she
replied
with
a
smile
but
do
not
let
the
torrent
of
your
feelings
end
by
sweeping
me
away
also
siddharta
took
his
vows
alone
i
want
ours
to
be
a
joint
arrangement
the
idea
passed
away
in
talk
the
fact
is
bimala
is
at
heart
what
is
called
a
lady
though
her
own
people
are
not
well
off
she
was
born
a
rani
she
has
no
doubts
in
her
mind
that
there
is
a
lower
unit
of
measure
for
the
trials
and
troubles
of
the
lower
classes
want
is
of
course
a
permanent
feature
of
their
lives
but
does
not
necessarily
mean
want
to
them
their
very
smallness
protects
them
as
the
banks
protect
the
pool
by
widening
bounds
only
the
slime
is
exposed
the
real
fact
is
that
bimala
has
only
come
into
my
home
not
into
my
life
i
had
magnified
her
so
leaving
her
such
a
large
place
that
when
i
lost
her
my
whole
way
of
life
became
narrow
and
confined
i
had
thrust
aside
all
other
objects
into
a
corner
to
make
room
for
bimala
taken
up
as
i
was
with
decorating
her
and
dressing
her
and
educating
her
and
moving
round
her
day
and
night
forgetting
how
great
is
humanity
and
how
nobly
precious
is
man
life
when
the
actualities
of
everyday
things
get
the
better
of
the
man
then
is
truth
lost
sight
of
and
freedom
missed
so
painfully
important
did
bimala
make
the
mere
actualities
that
the
truth
remained
concealed
from
me
that
is
why
i
find
no
gap
in
my
misery
and
spread
this
minute
point
of
my
emptiness
over
all
the
world
and
so
for
hours
on
this
autumn
morning
the
refrain
has
been
humming
in
my
ears
it
is
the
month
of
august
and
the
sky
breaks
into
a
passionate
rain
alas
my
house
is
empty
the
name
by
which
buddha
was
known
when
a
prince
before
renouncing
the
world
bimala
story
xi
the
change
which
had
in
a
moment
come
over
the
mind
of
bengal
was
tremendous
it
was
as
if
the
ganges
had
touched
the
ashes
of
the
sixty
thousand
sons
of
sagar
which
no
fire
could
enkindle
no
other
water
knead
again
into
living
clay
the
ashes
of
lifeless
bengal
suddenly
spoke
up
here
am
i
i
have
read
somewhere
that
in
ancient
greece
a
sculptor
had
the
good
fortune
to
impart
life
to
the
image
made
by
his
own
hand
even
in
that
miracle
however
there
was
the
process
of
form
preceding
life
but
where
was
the
unity
in
this
heap
of
barren
ashes
had
they
been
hard
like
stone
we
might
have
had
hopes
of
some
form
emerging
even
as
ahalya
though
turned
to
stone
at
last
won
back
her
humanity
but
these
scattered
ashes
must
have
dropped
to
the
dust
through
gaps
in
the
creator
fingers
to
be
blown
hither
and
thither
by
the
wind
they
had
become
heaped
up
but
were
never
before
united
yet
in
this
day
which
had
come
to
bengal
even
this
collection
of
looseness
had
taken
shape
and
proclaimed
in
a
thundering
voice
at
our
very
door
here
i
am
how
could
we
help
thinking
that
it
was
all
supernatural
this
moment
of
our
history
seemed
to
have
dropped
into
our
hand
like
a
jewel
from
the
crown
of
some
drunken
god
it
had
no
resemblance
to
our
past
and
so
we
were
led
to
hope
that
all
our
wants
and
miseries
would
disappear
by
the
spell
of
some
magic
charm
that
for
us
there
was
no
longer
any
boundary
line
between
the
possible
and
the
impossible
everything
seemed
to
be
saying
to
us
it
is
coming
it
has
come
thus
we
came
to
cherish
the
belief
that
our
history
needed
no
steed
but
that
like
heaven
chariot
it
would
move
with
its
own
inherent
power
at
least
no
wages
would
have
to
be
paid
to
the
charioteer
only
his
wine
cup
would
have
to
be
filled
again
and
again
and
then
in
some
impossible
paradise
the
goal
of
our
hopes
would
be
reached
my
husband
was
not
altogether
unmoved
but
through
all
our
excitement
it
was
the
strain
of
sadness
in
him
which
deepened
and
deepened
he
seemed
to
have
a
vision
of
something
beyond
the
surging
present
i
remember
one
day
in
the
course
of
the
arguments
he
continually
had
with
sandip
he
said
good
fortune
comes
to
our
gate
and
announces
itself
only
to
prove
that
we
have
not
the
power
to
receive
it
that
we
have
not
kept
things
ready
to
be
able
to
invite
it
into
our
house
no
was
sandip
answer
you
talk
like
an
atheist
because
you
do
not
believe
in
our
gods
to
us
it
has
been
made
quite
visible
that
the
goddess
has
come
with
her
boon
yet
you
distrust
the
obvious
signs
of
her
presence
it
is
because
i
strongly
believe
in
my
god
said
my
husband
that
i
feel
so
certain
that
our
preparations
for
his
worship
are
lacking
god
has
power
to
give
the
boon
but
we
must
have
power
to
accept
it
this
kind
of
talk
from
my
husband
would
only
annoy
me
i
could
not
keep
from
joining
in
you
think
this
excitement
is
only
a
fire
of
drunkenness
but
does
not
drunkenness
up
to
a
point
give
strength
yes
my
husband
replied
it
may
give
strength
but
not
weapons
but
strength
is
the
gift
of
god
i
went
on
weapons
can
be
supplied
by
mere
mechanics
my
husband
smiled
the
mechanics
will
claim
their
wages
before
they
deliver
their
supplies
he
said
sandip
swelled
his
chest
as
he
retorted
do
you
trouble
about
that
their
wages
shall
be
paid
i
shall
bespeak
the
festive
music
when
the
payment
has
been
made
not
before
my
husband
answered
you
need
imagine
that
we
are
depending
on
your
bounty
for
the
music
said
sandip
scornfully
our
festival
is
above
all
money
payments
and
in
his
thick
voice
he
began
to
sing
my
lover
of
the
unpriced
love
spurning
payments
plays
upon
the
simple
pipe
bought
for
nothing
drawing
my
heart
away
then
with
a
smile
he
turned
to
me
and
said
if
i
sing
queen
bee
it
is
only
to
prove
that
when
music
comes
into
one
life
the
lack
of
a
good
voice
is
no
matter
when
we
sing
merely
on
the
strength
of
our
tunefulness
the
song
is
belittled
now
that
a
full
flood
of
music
has
swept
over
our
country
let
nikhil
practise
his
scales
while
we
rouse
the
land
with
our
cracked
voices
my
house
cries
to
me
why
go
out
to
lose
your
all
my
life
says
all
that
you
have
fling
to
the
winds
if
we
must
lose
our
all
let
us
lose
it
what
is
it
worth
after
all
if
i
must
court
ruin
let
me
do
it
smilingly
for
my
quest
is
the
of
immortality
the
truth
is
nikhil
that
we
have
all
lost
our
hearts
none
can
hold
us
any
longer
within
the
bounds
of
the
easily
possible
in
our
forward
rush
to
the
hopelessly
impossible
those
who
would
draw
us
back
they
know
not
the
fearful
joy
of
recklessness
they
know
not
that
we
have
had
our
call
from
the
end
of
the
crooked
path
all
that
is
good
and
straight
and
trim
let
it
topple
over
in
the
dust
i
thought
that
my
husband
was
going
to
continue
the
discussion
but
he
rose
silently
from
his
seat
and
left
us
the
thing
that
was
agitating
me
within
was
merely
a
variation
of
the
stormy
passion
outside
which
swept
the
country
from
one
end
to
the
other
the
car
of
the
wielder
of
my
destiny
was
fast
approaching
and
the
sound
of
its
wheels
reverberated
in
my
being
i
had
a
constant
feeling
that
something
extraordinary
might
happen
any
moment
for
which
however
the
responsibility
would
not
be
mine
was
i
not
removed
from
the
plane
in
which
right
and
wrong
and
the
feelings
of
others
have
to
be
considered
had
i
ever
wanted
this
had
i
ever
been
waiting
or
hoping
for
any
such
thing
look
at
my
whole
life
and
tell
me
then
if
i
was
in
any
way
accountable
through
all
my
past
i
had
been
consistent
in
my
devotion
but
when
at
length
it
came
to
receiving
the
boon
a
different
god
appeared
and
just
as
the
awakened
country
with
its
thrills
in
salutation
to
the
unrealized
future
before
it
so
do
all
my
veins
and
nerves
send
forth
shocks
of
welcome
to
the
the
unknown
the
importunate
stranger
one
night
i
left
my
bed
and
slipped
out
of
my
room
on
to
the
open
terrace
beyond
our
garden
wall
are
fields
of
ripening
rice
through
the
gaps
in
the
village
groves
to
the
north
glimpses
of
the
river
are
seen
the
whole
scene
slept
in
the
darkness
like
the
vague
embryo
of
some
future
creation
in
that
future
i
saw
my
country
a
woman
like
myself
standing
expectant
she
has
been
drawn
forth
from
her
home
corner
by
the
sudden
call
of
some
unknown
she
has
had
no
time
to
pause
or
ponder
or
to
light
herself
a
torch
as
she
rushes
forward
into
the
darkness
ahead
i
know
well
how
her
very
soul
responds
to
the
distant
which
call
her
how
her
breast
rises
and
falls
how
she
feels
she
nears
it
nay
it
is
already
hers
so
that
it
matters
not
even
if
she
run
blindfold
she
is
no
mother
there
is
no
call
to
her
of
children
in
their
hunger
no
home
to
be
lighted
of
an
evening
no
household
work
to
be
done
so
she
hies
to
her
tryst
for
this
is
the
land
of
the
vaishnava
poets
she
has
left
home
forgotten
domestic
duties
she
has
nothing
but
an
unfathomable
yearning
which
hurries
her
on
by
what
road
to
what
goal
she
recks
not
i
also
am
possessed
of
just
such
a
yearning
i
likewise
have
lost
my
home
and
also
lost
my
way
both
the
end
and
the
means
have
become
equally
shadowy
to
me
there
remain
only
the
yearning
and
the
hurrying
on
ah
wretched
wanderer
through
the
night
when
the
dawn
reddens
you
will
see
no
trace
of
a
way
to
return
but
why
return
death
will
serve
as
well
if
the
dark
which
sounded
the
flute
should
lead
to
destruction
why
trouble
about
the
hereafter
when
i
am
merged
in
its
blackness
neither
i
nor
good
and
bad
nor
laughter
nor
tears
shall
be
any
more
the
condition
of
the
curse
which
had
reduced
them
to
ashes
was
such
that
they
could
only
be
restored
to
life
if
the
stream
of
the
ganges
was
brought
down
to
them
xii
in
bengal
the
machinery
of
time
being
thus
suddenly
run
at
full
pressure
things
which
were
difficult
became
easy
one
following
soon
after
another
nothing
could
be
held
back
any
more
even
in
our
corner
of
the
country
in
the
beginning
our
district
was
backward
for
my
husband
was
unwilling
to
put
any
compulsion
on
the
villagers
those
who
make
sacrifices
for
their
sake
are
indeed
her
servants
he
would
say
but
those
who
compel
others
to
make
them
in
her
name
are
her
enemies
they
would
cut
freedom
at
the
root
to
gain
it
at
the
top
but
when
sandip
came
and
settled
here
and
his
followers
began
to
move
about
the
country
speaking
in
towns
and
waves
of
excitement
came
rolling
up
to
us
as
well
a
band
of
young
fellows
of
the
locality
attached
themselves
to
him
some
even
who
had
been
known
as
a
disgrace
to
the
village
but
the
glow
of
their
genuine
enthusiasm
lighted
them
up
within
as
well
as
without
it
became
quite
clear
that
when
the
pure
breezes
of
a
great
joy
and
hope
sweep
through
the
land
all
dirt
and
decay
are
cleansed
away
it
is
hard
indeed
for
men
to
be
frank
and
straight
and
healthy
when
their
country
is
in
the
throes
of
dejection
then
were
all
eyes
turned
on
my
husband
from
whose
estates
alone
foreign
sugar
and
salt
and
cloths
had
not
been
banished
even
the
estate
officers
began
to
feel
awkward
and
ashamed
over
it
and
yet
some
time
ago
when
my
husband
began
to
import
made
articles
into
our
village
he
had
been
secretly
and
openly
twitted
for
his
folly
by
old
and
young
alike
when
had
not
yet
become
a
boast
we
had
despised
it
with
all
our
hearts
my
husband
still
sharpens
his
pencils
with
his
knife
does
his
writing
with
reed
pens
drinks
his
water
out
of
a
vessel
and
works
at
night
in
the
light
of
an
lamp
but
this
dull
water
of
his
never
appealed
to
us
rather
we
had
always
felt
ashamed
of
the
inelegant
unfashionable
furniture
of
his
especially
when
he
had
the
magistrate
or
any
other
european
as
his
guest
my
husband
used
to
make
light
of
my
protests
why
allow
such
trifles
to
upset
you
he
would
say
with
a
smile
they
will
think
us
barbarians
or
at
all
events
wanting
in
refinement
if
they
do
i
will
pay
them
back
by
thinking
that
their
refinement
does
not
go
deeper
than
their
white
skins
my
husband
had
an
ordinary
brass
pot
on
his
which
he
used
as
a
it
has
often
happened
that
when
i
had
news
of
some
european
guest
i
would
steal
into
his
room
and
put
in
its
place
a
crystal
vase
of
european
make
look
here
bimala
he
objected
at
length
that
brass
pot
is
as
unconscious
of
itself
as
those
blossoms
are
but
this
thing
protests
its
purpose
so
loudly
it
is
only
fit
for
artificial
flowers
the
bara
rani
alone
pandered
to
my
husband
whims
once
she
comes
panting
to
say
oh
brother
have
you
heard
such
lovely
indian
soaps
have
come
out
my
days
of
luxury
are
gone
by
still
if
they
contain
no
animal
fat
i
should
like
to
try
some
this
sort
of
thing
makes
my
husband
beam
all
over
and
the
house
is
deluged
with
indian
scents
and
soaps
soaps
indeed
they
are
more
like
lumps
of
caustic
soda
and
do
i
not
know
that
what
my
uses
on
herself
are
the
european
soaps
of
old
while
these
are
made
over
to
the
maids
for
washing
clothes
another
time
it
is
oh
brother
dear
do
get
me
some
of
these
new
indian
her
brother
bubbles
up
as
usual
and
the
bara
rani
room
becomes
littered
with
all
kinds
of
awful
sticks
that
go
by
the
name
of
not
that
it
makes
any
difference
to
her
for
reading
and
writing
are
out
of
her
line
still
in
her
lies
the
selfsame
ivory
the
only
one
ever
handled
the
fact
is
all
this
was
intended
as
a
hit
at
me
because
i
would
not
keep
my
husband
company
in
his
vagaries
it
was
no
good
trying
to
show
up
my
insincerity
my
husband
face
would
set
so
hard
if
i
barely
touched
on
it
one
only
gets
into
trouble
trying
to
save
such
people
from
being
imposed
upon
the
bara
rani
loves
sewing
one
day
i
could
not
help
blurting
out
what
a
humbug
you
are
sister
when
your
is
present
your
mouth
waters
at
the
very
mention
of
scissors
but
it
is
the
article
every
time
when
you
work
what
harm
she
replied
do
you
not
see
what
pleasure
it
gives
him
we
have
grown
up
together
in
this
house
since
he
was
a
boy
i
simply
can
not
bear
as
you
can
the
sight
of
the
smile
leaving
his
face
poor
dear
he
has
no
amusement
except
this
playing
at
you
are
his
only
dissipation
and
you
will
yet
be
his
ruin
whatever
you
may
say
it
is
not
right
to
be
i
retorted
my
laughed
out
in
my
face
oh
our
artless
little
chota
rani
straight
as
a
schoolmaster
rod
eh
but
a
woman
is
not
built
that
way
she
is
soft
and
supple
so
that
she
may
bend
without
being
crooked
i
could
not
forget
those
words
you
are
his
dissipation
and
will
be
his
ruin
today
i
feel
if
a
man
needs
must
have
some
intoxicant
let
it
not
be
a
woman
xiii
suksar
within
our
estates
is
one
of
the
biggest
trade
centres
in
the
district
on
one
side
of
a
stretch
of
water
there
is
held
a
daily
bazar
on
the
other
a
weekly
market
during
the
rains
when
this
piece
of
water
gets
connected
with
the
river
and
boats
can
come
through
great
quantities
of
cotton
yarns
and
woollen
stuffs
for
the
coming
winter
are
brought
in
for
sale
at
the
height
of
our
enthusiasm
sandip
laid
it
down
that
all
foreign
articles
together
with
the
demon
of
foreign
influence
must
be
driven
out
of
our
territory
of
course
said
i
girding
myself
up
for
a
fight
i
have
had
words
with
nikhil
about
it
said
sandip
he
tells
me
he
does
not
mind
speechifying
but
he
will
not
have
coercion
i
will
see
to
that
i
said
with
a
proud
sense
of
power
i
knew
how
deep
was
my
husband
love
for
me
had
i
been
in
my
senses
i
should
have
allowed
myself
to
be
torn
to
pieces
rather
than
assert
my
claim
to
that
at
such
a
time
but
sandip
had
to
be
impressed
with
the
full
strength
of
my
sandip
had
brought
home
to
me
in
his
irresistible
way
how
the
cosmic
energy
was
revealed
for
each
individual
in
the
shape
of
some
special
affinity
vaishnava
philosophy
he
said
speaks
of
the
of
delight
that
dwells
in
the
heart
of
creation
ever
attracting
the
heart
of
her
eternal
lover
men
have
a
perpetual
longing
to
bring
out
this
from
the
hidden
depths
of
their
own
nature
and
those
of
us
who
succeed
in
doing
so
at
once
clearly
understand
the
meaning
of
the
music
coming
to
us
from
the
dark
he
broke
out
singing
my
flute
that
was
busy
with
its
song
is
silent
now
when
we
stand
face
to
face
my
call
went
seeking
you
from
sky
to
sky
when
you
lay
hidden
but
now
all
my
cry
finds
its
smile
in
the
face
of
my
beloved
listening
to
his
allegories
i
had
forgotten
that
i
was
plain
and
simple
bimala
i
was
also
an
embodiment
of
universal
joy
nothing
could
fetter
me
nothing
was
impossible
for
me
whatever
i
touched
would
gain
new
life
the
world
around
me
was
a
fresh
creation
of
mine
for
behold
before
my
response
had
touched
it
there
had
not
been
this
wealth
of
gold
in
the
autumn
sky
and
this
hero
this
true
servant
of
the
country
this
devotee
of
mine
this
flaming
intelligence
this
burning
energy
this
shining
genius
him
also
was
i
creating
from
moment
to
moment
have
i
not
seen
how
my
presence
pours
fresh
life
into
him
time
after
time
the
other
day
sandip
begged
me
to
receive
a
young
lad
amulya
an
ardent
disciple
of
his
in
a
moment
i
could
see
a
new
light
flash
out
from
the
boy
eyes
and
knew
that
he
too
had
a
vision
of
manifest
that
my
creative
force
had
begun
its
work
in
his
blood
what
sorcery
is
this
of
yours
exclaimed
sandip
next
day
amulya
is
a
boy
no
longer
the
wick
of
his
life
is
all
ablaze
who
can
hide
your
fire
under
your
every
one
of
them
must
be
touched
up
by
it
sooner
or
later
and
when
every
lamp
is
alight
what
a
grand
carnival
of
a
we
shall
have
in
the
country
blinded
with
the
brilliance
of
my
own
glory
i
had
decided
to
grant
my
devotee
this
boon
i
was
overweeningly
confident
that
none
could
baulk
me
of
what
i
really
wanted
when
i
returned
to
my
room
after
my
talk
with
sandip
i
loosed
my
hair
and
tied
it
up
over
again
miss
gilby
had
taught
me
a
way
of
brushing
it
up
from
the
neck
and
piling
it
in
a
knot
over
my
head
this
style
was
a
favourite
one
with
my
husband
it
is
a
pity
he
once
said
that
providence
should
have
chosen
poor
me
instead
of
poet
kalidas
for
revealing
all
the
wonders
of
a
woman
neck
the
poet
would
probably
have
likened
it
to
a
but
i
feel
it
to
be
a
torch
holding
aloft
the
black
flame
of
your
hair
with
which
he
but
why
oh
why
do
i
go
back
to
all
that
i
sent
for
my
husband
in
the
old
days
i
could
contrive
a
hundred
and
one
excuses
good
or
bad
to
get
him
to
come
to
me
now
that
all
this
had
stopped
for
days
i
had
lost
the
art
of
contriving
nikhil
story
vi
panchu
wife
has
just
died
of
a
lingering
consumption
panchu
must
undergo
a
purification
ceremony
to
cleanse
himself
of
sin
and
to
propitiate
his
community
the
community
has
calculated
and
informed
him
that
it
will
cost
one
hundred
and
rupees
how
absurd
i
cried
highly
indignant
do
submit
to
this
panchu
what
can
they
do
to
you
raising
to
me
his
patient
eyes
like
those
of
a
beast
of
burden
he
said
there
is
my
eldest
girl
sir
she
will
have
to
be
married
and
my
poor
wife
last
rites
have
to
be
put
through
even
if
the
sin
were
yours
panchu
i
mused
aloud
you
have
surely
suffered
enough
for
it
already
that
is
so
sir
he
naïvely
assented
i
had
to
sell
part
of
my
land
and
mortgage
the
rest
to
meet
the
doctor
bills
but
there
is
no
escape
from
the
offerings
i
have
to
make
the
brahmins
what
was
the
use
of
arguing
when
will
come
the
time
i
wondered
for
the
purification
of
the
brahmins
themselves
who
can
accept
such
offerings
after
his
wife
illness
and
funeral
panchu
who
had
been
tottering
on
the
brink
of
starvation
went
altogether
beyond
his
depth
in
a
desperate
attempt
to
gain
consolation
of
some
sort
he
took
to
sitting
at
the
feet
of
a
wandering
ascetic
and
succeeded
in
acquiring
philosophy
enough
to
forget
that
his
children
went
hungry
he
kept
himself
steeped
for
a
time
in
the
idea
that
the
world
is
vanity
and
if
of
pleasure
it
has
none
pain
also
is
a
delusion
then
at
last
one
night
he
left
his
little
ones
in
their
hovel
and
started
off
wandering
on
his
own
account
i
knew
nothing
of
this
at
the
time
for
just
then
a
veritable
by
gods
and
demons
was
going
on
in
my
mind
nor
did
my
master
tell
me
that
he
had
taken
panchu
deserted
children
under
his
own
roof
and
was
caring
for
them
though
alone
in
the
house
with
his
school
to
attend
to
the
whole
day
after
a
month
panchu
came
back
his
ascetic
fervour
considerably
worn
off
his
eldest
boy
and
girl
nestled
up
to
him
crying
where
have
you
been
all
this
time
father
his
youngest
boy
filled
his
lap
his
second
girl
leant
over
his
back
with
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
they
all
wept
together
o
sir
sobbed
panchu
at
length
to
my
master
i
have
not
the
power
to
give
these
little
ones
enough
to
eat
i
am
not
free
to
run
away
from
them
what
has
been
my
sin
that
i
should
be
scourged
so
bound
hand
and
foot
in
the
meantime
the
thread
of
panchu
little
trade
connections
had
snapped
and
he
found
he
could
not
resume
them
he
clung
on
to
the
shelter
of
my
master
roof
which
had
first
received
him
on
his
return
and
said
not
a
word
of
going
back
home
look
here
panchu
my
master
was
at
last
driven
to
say
if
you
do
take
care
of
your
cottage
it
will
tumble
down
altogether
i
will
lend
you
some
money
with
which
you
can
do
a
bit
of
peddling
and
return
it
me
little
by
little
panchu
was
not
excessively
pleased
was
there
then
no
such
thing
as
charity
on
earth
and
when
my
master
asked
him
to
write
out
a
receipt
for
the
money
he
felt
that
this
favour
demanding
a
return
was
hardly
worth
having
my
master
however
did
not
care
to
make
an
outward
gift
which
would
leave
an
inward
obligation
to
destroy
is
to
destroy
caste
was
his
idea
after
signing
the
note
panchu
obeisance
to
my
master
fell
off
considerably
in
its
reverence
the
was
left
out
it
made
my
master
smile
he
asked
nothing
better
than
that
courtesy
should
stoop
less
low
respect
given
and
taken
truly
balances
the
account
between
man
and
man
was
the
way
he
put
it
but
veneration
is
overpayment
panchu
began
to
buy
cloth
at
the
market
and
peddle
it
about
the
village
he
did
not
get
much
of
cash
payment
it
is
true
but
what
he
could
realize
in
kind
in
the
way
of
rice
jute
and
other
field
produce
went
towards
settlement
of
his
account
in
two
month
time
he
was
able
to
pay
back
an
instalment
of
my
master
debt
and
with
it
there
was
a
corresponding
reduction
in
the
depth
of
his
bow
he
must
have
begun
to
feel
that
he
had
been
revering
as
a
saint
a
mere
man
who
had
not
even
risen
superior
to
the
lure
of
lucre
while
panchu
was
thus
engaged
the
full
shock
of
the
flood
fell
on
him
vii
it
was
vacation
time
and
many
youths
of
our
village
and
its
neighbourhood
had
come
home
from
their
schools
and
colleges
they
attached
themselves
to
sandip
leadership
with
enthusiasm
and
some
in
their
excess
of
zeal
gave
up
their
studies
altogether
many
of
the
boys
had
been
free
pupils
of
my
school
here
and
some
held
college
scholarships
from
me
in
calcutta
they
came
up
in
a
body
and
demanded
that
i
should
banish
foreign
goods
from
my
suksar
market
i
told
them
i
could
not
do
it
they
were
sarcastic
why
maharaja
will
the
loss
be
too
much
for
you
i
took
no
notice
of
the
insult
in
their
tone
and
was
about
to
reply
that
the
loss
would
fall
on
the
poor
traders
and
their
customers
not
on
me
when
my
master
who
was
present
interposed
yes
the
loss
will
be
his
not
yours
that
is
clear
enough
he
said
but
for
one
country
the
country
does
not
mean
the
soil
but
the
men
on
it
interrupted
my
master
again
have
you
yet
wasted
so
much
as
a
glance
on
what
was
happening
to
them
but
now
you
would
dictate
what
salt
they
shall
eat
what
clothes
they
shall
wear
why
should
they
put
up
with
such
tyranny
and
why
should
we
let
them
but
we
have
taken
to
indian
salt
and
sugar
and
cloth
ourselves
you
may
do
as
you
please
to
work
off
your
irritation
to
keep
up
your
fanaticism
you
are
well
off
you
need
not
mind
the
cost
the
poor
do
not
want
to
stand
in
your
way
but
you
insist
on
their
submitting
to
your
compulsion
as
it
is
every
moment
of
theirs
is
a
struggle
for
a
bare
living
you
can
not
even
imagine
the
difference
a
few
pice
means
to
them
so
little
have
you
in
common
you
have
spent
your
whole
past
in
a
superior
compartment
and
now
you
come
down
to
use
them
as
tools
for
the
wreaking
of
your
wrath
i
call
it
cowardly
they
were
all
old
pupils
of
my
master
so
they
did
not
venture
to
be
disrespectful
though
they
were
quivering
with
indignation
they
turned
to
me
will
you
then
be
the
only
one
maharaja
to
put
obstacles
in
the
way
of
what
the
country
would
achieve
who
am
i
that
i
should
dare
do
such
a
thing
would
i
not
rather
lay
down
my
life
to
help
it
the
student
smiled
a
crooked
smile
as
he
asked
may
we
enquire
what
you
are
actually
doing
to
help
i
have
imported
indian
yarn
and
kept
it
for
sale
in
my
suksar
market
and
also
sent
bales
of
it
to
markets
belonging
to
neighbouring
but
we
have
been
to
your
market
maharaja
the
same
student
exclaimed
and
found
nobody
buying
this
yarn
that
is
neither
my
fault
nor
the
fault
of
my
market
it
only
shows
the
whole
country
has
not
taken
your
vow
that
is
not
all
my
master
went
on
it
shows
that
what
you
have
pledged
yourselves
to
do
is
only
to
pester
others
you
want
dealers
who
have
not
taken
your
vow
to
buy
that
yarn
weavers
who
have
not
taken
your
vow
to
make
it
up
then
their
wares
eventually
to
be
foisted
on
to
consumers
who
also
have
not
taken
your
vow
the
method
your
clamour
and
the
oppression
the
result
all
righteousness
yours
all
privations
theirs
and
may
we
venture
to
ask
further
what
your
share
of
the
privation
has
been
pursued
a
science
student
you
want
to
know
do
you
replied
my
master
it
is
nikhil
himself
who
has
to
buy
up
that
indian
mill
yarn
he
has
had
to
start
a
weaving
school
to
get
it
woven
and
to
judge
by
his
past
brilliant
business
exploits
by
the
time
his
cotton
fabrics
leave
the
loom
their
cost
will
be
that
of
so
they
will
only
find
a
use
perhaps
as
curtains
for
his
even
though
their
flimsiness
may
fail
to
screen
him
when
you
get
tired
of
your
vow
you
will
laugh
the
loudest
at
their
artistic
effect
and
if
their
workmanship
is
ever
truly
appreciated
at
all
it
will
be
by
foreigners
i
have
known
my
master
all
my
life
but
have
never
seen
him
so
agitated
i
could
see
that
the
pain
had
been
silently
accumulating
in
his
heart
for
some
time
because
of
his
surpassing
love
for
me
and
that
his
habitual
had
become
secretly
undermined
to
the
breaking
point
you
are
our
elders
said
the
medical
student
it
is
unseemly
that
we
should
bandy
words
with
you
but
tell
us
pray
finally
are
you
determined
not
to
oust
foreign
articles
from
your
market
i
will
not
i
said
because
they
are
not
mine
because
that
will
cause
you
a
loss
smiled
the
student
because
he
whose
is
the
loss
is
the
best
judge
retorted
my
master
with
a
shout
of
they
left
us
chapter
six
nikhil
story
viii
a
few
days
later
my
master
brought
panchu
round
to
me
his
it
appeared
had
fined
him
a
hundred
rupees
and
was
threatening
him
with
ejectment
for
what
fault
i
enquired
because
i
was
told
he
has
been
found
selling
foreign
cloths
he
begged
and
prayed
harish
kundu
his
to
let
him
sell
off
his
stock
bought
with
borrowed
money
promising
faithfully
never
to
do
it
again
but
the
would
not
hear
of
it
and
insisted
on
his
burning
the
foreign
stuff
there
and
then
if
he
wanted
to
be
let
off
panchu
in
his
desperation
blurted
out
defiantly
i
ca
afford
it
you
are
rich
why
not
buy
it
up
and
burn
it
this
only
made
harish
kundu
red
in
the
face
as
he
shouted
the
scoundrel
must
be
taught
manners
give
him
a
so
poor
panchu
got
insulted
as
well
as
fined
what
happened
to
the
cloth
the
whole
bale
was
burnt
who
else
was
there
any
number
of
people
who
all
kept
shouting
sandip
was
also
there
he
took
up
some
of
the
ashes
crying
this
is
the
first
funeral
pyre
lighted
by
your
village
in
celebration
of
the
last
rites
of
foreign
commerce
these
are
sacred
ashes
smear
yourselves
with
them
in
token
of
your
vow
panchu
said
i
turning
to
him
you
must
lodge
a
complaint
no
one
will
bear
me
witness
he
replied
none
bear
witness
sandip
sandip
sandip
came
out
of
his
room
at
my
call
what
is
the
matter
he
asked
wo
you
bear
witness
to
the
burning
of
this
man
cloth
sandip
smiled
of
course
i
shall
be
a
witness
in
the
case
he
said
but
i
shall
be
on
the
opposite
side
what
do
you
mean
i
exclaimed
by
being
a
witness
on
this
or
that
side
will
you
not
bear
witness
to
the
truth
is
the
thing
which
happens
the
only
truth
what
other
truths
can
there
be
the
things
that
ought
to
happen
the
truth
we
must
build
up
will
require
a
great
deal
of
untruth
in
the
process
those
who
have
made
their
way
in
the
world
have
created
truth
not
blindly
followed
it
and
so
and
so
i
will
bear
what
you
people
are
pleased
to
call
false
witness
as
they
have
done
who
have
created
empires
built
up
social
systems
founded
religious
organizations
those
who
would
rule
do
not
dread
untruths
the
shackles
of
truth
are
reserved
for
those
who
will
fall
under
their
sway
have
you
not
read
history
do
you
not
know
that
in
the
immense
cauldrons
where
vast
political
developments
are
simmering
untruths
are
the
main
ingredients
political
cookery
on
a
large
scale
is
doubtless
going
on
but
oh
i
know
you
of
course
will
never
do
any
of
the
cooking
you
prefer
to
be
one
of
those
down
whose
throats
the
hotchpotch
which
is
being
cooked
will
be
crammed
they
will
partition
bengal
and
say
it
is
for
your
benefit
they
will
seal
the
doors
of
education
and
call
it
raising
the
standard
but
you
will
always
remain
good
boys
snivelling
in
your
corners
we
bad
men
however
must
see
whether
we
can
not
erect
a
defensive
fortification
of
untruth
it
is
no
use
arguing
about
these
things
nikhil
my
master
interposed
how
can
they
who
do
not
feel
the
truth
within
them
realize
that
to
bring
it
out
from
its
obscurity
into
the
light
is
man
highest
aim
not
to
keep
on
heaping
material
outside
sandip
laughed
right
sir
said
he
quite
a
correct
speech
for
a
schoolmaster
that
is
the
kind
of
stuff
i
have
read
in
books
but
in
the
real
world
i
have
seen
that
man
chief
business
is
the
accumulation
of
outside
material
those
who
are
masters
in
the
art
advertise
the
biggest
lies
in
their
business
enter
false
accounts
in
their
political
ledgers
with
their
pens
launch
their
newspapers
daily
laden
with
untruths
and
send
preachers
abroad
to
disseminate
falsehood
like
flies
carrying
pestilential
germs
i
am
a
humble
follower
of
these
great
ones
when
i
was
attached
to
the
congress
party
i
never
hesitated
to
dilute
ten
per
cent
of
truth
with
ninety
per
cent
of
untruth
and
now
merely
because
i
have
ceased
to
belong
to
that
party
i
have
not
forgotten
the
basic
fact
that
goal
is
not
truth
but
success
true
success
corrected
my
master
maybe
replied
sandip
but
the
fruit
of
true
success
ripens
only
by
cultivating
the
field
of
untruth
after
tearing
up
the
soil
and
pounding
it
into
dust
truth
grows
up
by
itself
like
weeds
and
thorns
and
only
worms
can
expect
to
get
fruit
from
it
with
this
he
flung
out
of
the
room
my
master
smiled
as
he
looked
towards
me
do
you
know
nikhil
he
said
i
believe
sandip
is
not
irreligious
his
religion
is
of
the
obverse
side
of
truth
like
the
dark
moon
which
is
still
a
moon
for
all
that
its
light
has
gone
over
to
the
wrong
side
that
is
why
i
assented
i
have
always
had
an
affection
for
him
though
we
have
never
been
able
to
agree
i
can
not
contemn
him
even
now
though
he
has
hurt
me
sorely
and
may
yet
hurt
me
more
i
have
begun
to
realize
that
said
my
master
i
have
long
wondered
how
you
could
go
on
putting
up
with
him
i
have
at
times
even
suspected
you
of
weakness
i
now
see
that
though
you
two
do
not
rhyme
your
rhythm
is
the
same
fate
seems
bent
on
writing
in
blank
verse
in
my
case
and
so
has
no
use
for
a
rhyming
friend
i
remarked
pursuing
his
conceit
but
what
of
panchu
resumed
my
master
you
say
harish
kundu
wants
to
eject
him
from
his
ancestral
holding
supposing
i
buy
it
up
and
then
keep
him
on
as
my
tenant
and
his
fine
how
can
the
realize
that
if
he
becomes
my
tenant
his
burnt
bale
of
cloth
i
will
procure
him
another
i
should
like
to
see
anyone
interfering
with
a
tenant
of
mine
for
trading
as
he
pleases
i
am
afraid
sir
interposed
panchu
despondently
while
you
big
folk
are
doing
the
fighting
the
police
and
the
law
vultures
will
merrily
gather
round
and
the
crowd
will
enjoy
the
fun
but
when
it
comes
to
getting
killed
it
will
be
the
turn
of
only
poor
me
why
what
harm
can
come
to
you
they
will
burn
down
my
house
sir
children
and
all
very
well
i
will
take
charge
of
your
children
said
my
master
you
may
go
on
with
any
trade
you
like
they
sha
touch
you
that
very
day
i
bought
up
panchu
holding
and
entered
into
formal
possession
then
the
trouble
began
panchu
had
inherited
the
holding
of
his
grandfather
as
his
sole
surviving
heir
everybody
knew
this
but
at
this
juncture
an
aunt
turned
up
from
somewhere
with
her
boxes
and
bundles
her
rosary
and
a
widowed
niece
she
ensconced
herself
in
home
and
laid
claim
to
a
life
interest
in
all
he
had
panchu
was
dumbfounded
my
aunt
died
long
ago
he
protested
in
reply
he
was
told
that
he
was
thinking
of
his
uncle
first
wife
but
that
the
former
had
lost
no
time
in
taking
to
himself
a
second
but
my
uncle
died
before
my
aunt
exclaimed
panchu
still
more
mystified
where
was
the
time
for
him
to
marry
again
this
was
not
denied
but
panchu
was
reminded
that
it
had
never
been
asserted
that
the
second
wife
had
come
after
the
death
of
the
first
but
the
former
had
been
married
by
his
uncle
during
the
latter
lifetime
not
relishing
the
idea
of
living
with
a
she
had
remained
in
her
father
house
till
her
death
after
which
she
had
got
religion
and
retired
to
holy
brindaban
whence
she
was
now
coming
these
facts
were
well
known
to
the
officers
of
harish
kundu
as
well
as
to
some
of
his
tenants
and
if
the
summons
should
be
peremptory
enough
even
some
of
those
who
had
partaken
of
the
marriage
feast
would
be
forthcoming
ix
one
afternoon
when
i
happened
to
be
specially
busy
word
came
to
my
office
room
that
bimala
had
sent
for
me
i
was
startled
who
did
you
say
had
sent
for
me
i
asked
the
messenger
the
rani
mother
the
bara
rani
no
sir
the
chota
rani
mother
the
chota
rani
it
seemed
a
century
since
i
had
been
sent
for
by
her
i
kept
them
all
waiting
there
and
went
off
into
the
inner
apartments
when
i
stepped
into
our
room
i
had
another
shock
of
surprise
to
find
bimala
there
with
a
distinct
suggestion
of
being
dressed
up
the
room
which
from
persistent
neglect
had
latterly
acquired
an
air
of
having
grown
had
regained
something
of
its
old
order
this
afternoon
i
stood
there
silently
looking
enquiringly
at
bimala
she
flushed
a
little
and
the
fingers
of
her
right
hand
toyed
for
a
time
with
the
bangles
on
her
left
arm
then
she
abruptly
broke
the
silence
look
here
is
it
right
that
ours
should
be
the
only
market
in
all
bengal
which
allows
foreign
goods
what
then
would
be
the
right
thing
to
do
i
asked
order
them
to
be
cleared
out
but
the
goods
are
not
mine
is
not
the
market
yours
it
is
much
more
theirs
who
use
it
for
trade
let
them
trade
in
indian
goods
then
nothing
would
please
me
better
but
suppose
they
do
not
nonsense
how
dare
they
be
so
insolent
are
you
not
i
am
very
busy
this
afternoon
and
can
not
stop
to
argue
it
out
but
i
must
refuse
to
tyrannize
it
would
not
be
tyranny
for
selfish
gain
but
for
the
sake
of
the
country
to
tyrannize
for
the
country
is
to
tyrannize
over
the
country
but
that
i
am
afraid
you
will
never
understand
with
this
i
came
away
all
of
a
sudden
the
world
shone
out
for
me
with
a
fresh
clearness
i
seemed
to
feel
it
in
my
blood
that
the
earth
had
lost
the
weight
of
its
earthiness
and
its
daily
task
of
sustaining
life
no
longer
appeared
a
burden
as
with
a
wonderful
access
of
power
it
whirled
through
space
telling
its
beads
of
days
and
nights
what
endless
work
and
withal
what
illimitable
energy
of
freedom
none
shall
check
it
oh
none
can
ever
check
it
from
the
depths
of
my
being
an
uprush
of
joy
like
a
waterspout
sprang
high
to
storm
the
skies
i
repeatedly
asked
myself
the
meaning
of
this
outburst
of
feeling
at
first
there
was
no
intelligible
answer
then
it
became
clear
that
the
bond
against
which
i
had
been
fretting
inwardly
night
and
day
had
broken
to
my
surprise
i
discovered
that
my
mind
was
freed
from
all
mistiness
i
could
see
everything
relating
to
bimala
as
if
vividly
pictured
on
a
camera
screen
it
was
palpable
that
she
had
specially
dressed
herself
up
to
coax
that
order
out
of
me
till
that
moment
i
had
never
viewed
bimala
adornment
as
a
thing
apart
from
herself
but
today
the
elaborate
manner
in
which
she
had
done
up
her
hair
in
the
english
fashion
made
it
appear
a
mere
decoration
that
which
before
had
the
mystery
of
her
personality
about
it
and
was
priceless
to
me
was
now
out
to
sell
itself
cheap
as
i
came
away
from
that
broken
cage
of
a
bedroom
out
into
the
golden
sunlight
of
the
open
there
was
the
avenue
of
bauhinias
along
the
gravelled
path
in
front
of
my
verandah
suffusing
the
sky
with
a
rosy
flush
a
group
of
starlings
beneath
the
trees
were
noisily
chattering
away
in
the
distance
an
empty
bullock
cart
with
its
nose
on
the
ground
held
up
its
tail
aloft
one
of
its
unharnessed
bullocks
grazing
the
other
resting
on
the
grass
its
eyes
dropping
for
very
comfort
while
a
crow
on
its
back
was
pecking
away
at
the
insects
on
its
body
i
seemed
to
have
come
closer
to
the
heartbeats
of
the
great
earth
in
all
the
simplicity
of
its
daily
life
its
warm
breath
fell
on
me
with
the
perfume
of
the
bauhinia
blossoms
and
an
anthem
inexpressibly
sweet
seemed
to
peal
forth
from
this
world
where
i
in
my
freedom
live
in
the
freedom
of
all
else
we
men
are
knights
whose
quest
is
that
freedom
to
which
our
ideals
call
us
she
who
makes
for
us
the
banner
under
which
we
fare
forth
is
the
true
woman
for
us
we
must
tear
away
the
disguise
of
her
who
weaves
our
net
of
enchantment
at
home
and
know
her
for
what
she
is
we
must
beware
of
clothing
her
in
the
witchery
of
our
own
longings
and
imaginings
and
thus
allow
her
to
distract
us
from
our
true
quest
today
i
feel
that
i
shall
win
through
i
have
come
to
the
gateway
of
the
simple
i
am
now
content
to
see
things
as
they
are
i
have
gained
freedom
myself
i
shall
allow
freedom
to
others
in
my
work
will
be
my
salvation
i
know
that
time
and
again
my
heart
will
ache
but
now
that
i
understand
its
pain
in
all
its
truth
i
can
disregard
it
now
that
i
know
it
concerns
only
me
what
after
all
can
be
its
value
the
suffering
which
belongs
to
all
mankind
shall
be
my
crown
save
me
truth
never
again
let
me
hanker
after
the
false
paradise
of
illusion
if
i
must
walk
alone
let
me
at
least
tread
your
path
let
the
of
truth
lead
me
to
victory
sandip
story
vii
bimala
sent
for
me
that
day
but
for
a
time
she
could
not
utter
a
word
her
eyes
kept
brimming
up
to
the
verge
of
overflowing
i
could
see
at
once
that
she
had
been
unsuccessful
with
nikhil
she
had
been
so
proudly
confident
that
she
would
have
her
own
way
but
i
had
never
shared
her
confidence
woman
knows
man
well
enough
where
he
is
weak
but
she
is
quite
unable
to
fathom
him
where
he
is
strong
the
fact
is
that
man
is
as
much
a
mystery
to
woman
as
woman
is
to
man
if
that
were
not
so
the
separation
of
the
sexes
would
only
have
been
a
waste
of
nature
energy
ah
pride
pride
the
trouble
was
not
that
the
necessary
thing
had
failed
of
accomplishment
but
that
the
entreaty
which
had
cost
her
such
a
struggle
to
make
should
have
been
refused
what
a
wealth
of
colour
and
movement
suggestion
and
deception
group
themselves
round
this
me
and
mine
in
woman
that
is
just
where
her
beauty
lies
she
is
ever
so
much
more
personal
than
man
when
man
was
being
made
the
creator
was
a
schoolmaster
his
bag
full
of
commandments
and
principles
but
when
he
came
to
woman
he
resigned
his
headmastership
and
turned
artist
with
only
his
brush
and
when
bimala
stood
silently
there
flushed
and
tearful
in
her
broken
pride
like
a
laden
with
rain
and
charged
with
lightning
lowering
over
the
horizon
she
looked
so
absolutely
sweet
that
i
had
to
go
right
up
to
her
and
take
her
by
the
hand
it
was
trembling
but
she
did
not
snatch
it
away
bee
said
i
we
two
are
colleagues
for
our
aims
are
one
let
us
sit
down
and
talk
it
over
i
led
her
unresisting
to
a
seat
but
strange
at
that
very
point
the
rush
of
my
impetuosity
suffered
an
unaccountable
check
just
as
the
current
of
the
mighty
padma
roaring
on
in
its
irresistible
course
all
of
a
sudden
gets
turned
away
from
the
bank
it
is
crumbling
by
some
trifling
obstacle
beneath
the
surface
when
i
pressed
bimala
hand
my
nerves
rang
music
like
strings
but
the
symphony
stopped
short
at
the
first
movement
what
stood
in
the
way
nothing
singly
it
was
a
tangle
of
a
multitude
of
things
nothing
definitely
palpable
but
only
that
unaccountable
sense
of
obstruction
anyhow
this
much
has
become
plain
to
me
that
i
can
not
swear
to
what
i
really
am
it
is
because
i
am
such
a
mystery
to
my
own
mind
that
my
attraction
for
myself
is
so
strong
if
once
the
whole
of
myself
should
become
known
to
me
i
would
then
fling
it
all
away
and
reach
beatitude
as
she
sat
down
bimala
went
ashy
pale
she
too
must
have
realized
what
a
crisis
had
come
and
gone
leaving
her
unscathed
the
comet
had
passed
by
but
the
brush
of
its
burning
tail
had
overcome
her
to
help
her
to
recover
herself
i
said
obstacles
there
will
be
but
let
us
fight
them
through
and
not
be
hearted
is
not
that
best
queen
bimala
cleared
her
throat
with
a
little
cough
but
simply
to
murmur
yes
let
us
sketch
out
our
plan
of
action
i
continued
as
i
drew
a
piece
of
paper
and
a
pencil
from
my
pocket
i
began
to
make
a
list
of
the
workers
who
had
joined
us
from
calcutta
and
to
assign
their
duties
to
each
bimala
interrupted
me
before
i
was
through
saying
wearily
leave
it
now
i
will
join
you
again
this
evening
and
then
she
hurried
out
of
the
room
it
was
evident
she
was
not
in
a
state
to
attend
to
anything
she
must
be
alone
with
herself
for
a
while
perhaps
lie
down
on
her
bed
and
have
a
good
cry
when
she
left
me
my
intoxication
began
to
deepen
as
the
cloud
colours
grow
richer
after
the
sun
is
down
i
felt
i
had
let
the
moment
of
moments
slip
by
what
an
awful
coward
i
had
been
she
must
have
left
me
in
sheer
disgust
at
my
qualms
and
she
was
right
while
i
was
tingling
all
over
with
these
reflections
a
servant
came
in
and
announced
amulya
one
of
our
boys
i
felt
like
sending
him
away
for
the
time
but
he
stepped
in
before
i
could
make
up
my
mind
then
we
fell
to
discussing
the
news
of
the
fights
which
were
raging
in
different
quarters
over
cloth
and
sugar
and
salt
and
the
air
was
soon
clear
of
all
fumes
of
intoxication
i
felt
as
if
awakened
from
a
dream
i
leapt
to
my
feet
feeling
quite
ready
for
the
fray
bande
mataram
the
news
was
various
most
of
the
traders
who
were
tenants
of
harish
kundu
had
come
over
to
us
many
of
nikhil
officials
were
also
secretly
on
our
side
pulling
the
wires
in
our
interest
the
marwari
shopkeepers
were
offering
to
pay
a
penalty
if
only
allowed
to
clear
their
present
stocks
only
some
mahomedan
traders
were
still
obdurate
one
of
them
was
taking
home
some
shawls
for
his
family
these
were
confiscated
and
burnt
by
one
of
our
village
boys
this
had
given
rise
to
trouble
we
offered
to
buy
him
indian
woollen
stuffs
in
their
place
but
where
were
cheap
indian
woollens
to
be
had
we
could
not
very
well
indulge
him
in
cashmere
shawls
he
came
and
complained
to
nikhil
who
advised
him
to
go
to
law
of
course
nikhil
men
saw
to
it
that
the
trial
should
come
to
nothing
even
his
being
on
our
side
the
point
is
if
we
have
to
replace
burnt
foreign
clothes
with
indian
cloth
every
time
and
on
the
top
of
that
fight
through
a
where
is
the
money
to
come
from
and
the
beauty
of
it
is
that
this
destruction
of
foreign
goods
is
increasing
their
demand
and
sending
up
the
foreigner
profits
very
like
what
happened
to
the
fortunate
shopkeeper
whose
chandeliers
the
nabob
delighted
in
smashing
tickled
by
the
tinkle
of
the
breaking
glass
the
next
problem
is
since
there
is
no
such
thing
as
cheap
and
gaudy
indian
woollen
stuff
should
we
be
rigorous
in
our
boycott
of
foreign
flannels
and
memos
or
make
an
exception
in
their
favour
look
here
said
i
at
length
on
the
first
point
we
are
not
going
to
keep
on
making
presents
of
indian
stuff
to
those
who
have
got
their
foreign
purchases
confiscated
the
penalty
is
intended
to
fall
on
them
not
on
us
if
they
go
to
law
we
must
retaliate
by
burning
down
their
granaries
what
startles
you
amulya
it
is
not
the
prospect
of
a
grand
illumination
that
delights
me
you
must
remember
this
is
war
if
you
are
afraid
of
causing
suffering
go
in
for
you
will
never
do
for
this
work
the
second
problem
i
solved
by
deciding
to
allow
no
compromise
with
foreign
articles
in
any
circumstance
whatever
in
the
good
old
days
when
these
gaily
coloured
foreign
shawls
were
unknown
our
peasantry
used
to
manage
well
enough
with
plain
cotton
quilts
they
must
learn
to
do
so
again
they
may
not
look
as
gorgeous
but
this
is
not
the
time
to
think
of
looks
most
of
the
boatmen
had
been
won
over
to
refuse
to
carry
foreign
goods
but
the
chief
of
them
mirjan
was
still
insubordinate
could
you
not
get
his
boat
sunk
i
asked
our
manager
here
nothing
easier
sir
he
replied
but
what
if
afterwards
i
am
held
responsible
why
be
so
clumsy
as
to
leave
any
loophole
for
responsibility
however
if
there
must
be
any
my
shoulders
will
be
there
to
bear
it
mirjan
boat
was
tied
near
the
after
its
freight
had
been
taken
over
to
the
there
was
no
one
on
it
for
the
manager
had
arranged
for
some
entertainment
to
which
all
had
been
invited
after
dusk
the
boat
loaded
with
rubbish
was
holed
and
set
adrift
it
sank
in
mirjan
understood
the
whole
thing
he
came
to
me
in
tears
to
beg
for
mercy
i
was
wrong
sir
he
began
what
makes
you
realize
that
all
of
a
sudden
i
sneered
he
made
no
direct
reply
the
boat
was
worth
two
thousand
rupees
he
said
i
now
see
my
mistake
and
if
excused
this
time
i
will
never
with
which
he
threw
himself
at
my
feet
i
asked
him
to
come
ten
days
later
if
only
we
could
pay
him
that
two
thousand
rupees
at
once
we
could
buy
him
up
body
and
soul
this
is
just
the
sort
of
man
who
could
render
us
immense
service
if
won
over
we
shall
never
be
able
to
make
any
headway
unless
we
can
lay
our
hands
on
plenty
of
money
as
soon
as
bimala
came
into
the
in
the
evening
i
said
as
i
rose
up
to
receive
her
queen
everything
is
ready
success
is
at
hand
but
we
must
have
money
money
how
much
money
not
so
very
much
but
by
hook
or
by
crook
we
must
have
it
but
how
much
a
mere
fifty
thousand
rupees
will
do
for
the
present
bimala
blenched
inwardly
at
the
figure
but
tried
not
to
show
it
how
could
she
again
admit
defeat
queen
said
i
you
only
can
make
the
impossible
possible
indeed
you
have
already
done
so
oh
that
i
could
show
you
the
extent
of
your
achievement
then
you
would
know
it
but
the
time
for
that
is
not
now
now
we
want
money
you
shall
have
it
she
said
i
could
see
that
the
thought
of
selling
her
jewels
had
occurred
to
her
so
i
said
your
jewels
must
remain
in
reserve
one
can
never
tell
when
they
may
be
wanted
and
then
as
bimala
stared
blankly
at
me
in
silence
i
went
on
this
money
must
come
from
your
husband
treasury
bimala
was
still
more
taken
aback
after
a
long
pause
she
said
but
how
am
ito
get
his
money
is
not
his
money
yours
as
well
ah
no
she
said
her
wounded
pride
hurt
afresh
if
not
i
cried
neither
is
it
his
but
his
country
whom
he
has
deprived
of
it
in
her
time
of
need
but
how
am
ito
get
it
she
repeated
get
it
you
shall
and
must
you
know
best
how
you
must
get
it
for
her
to
whom
it
rightfully
belongs
these
are
the
magic
words
which
will
open
the
door
of
his
iron
safe
break
through
the
walls
of
his
and
confound
the
hearts
of
those
who
are
disloyal
to
its
call

we
are
men
we
are
kings
we
must
have
our
tribute
ever
since
we
have
come
upon
the
earth
we
have
been
plundering
her
and
the
more
we
claimed
the
more
she
submitted
from
primeval
days
have
we
men
been
plucking
fruits
cutting
down
trees
digging
up
the
soil
killing
beast
bird
and
fish
from
the
bottom
of
the
sea
from
underneath
the
ground
from
the
very
jaws
of
death
it
has
all
been
grabbing
and
grabbing
and
grabbing
no
in
nature
has
been
respected
or
left
unrifled
the
one
delight
of
this
earth
is
to
fulfil
the
claims
of
those
who
are
men
she
has
been
made
fertile
and
beautiful
and
complete
through
her
endless
sacrifices
to
them
but
for
this
she
would
be
lost
in
the
wilderness
not
knowing
herself
the
doors
of
her
heart
shut
her
diamonds
and
pearls
never
seeing
the
light
likewise
by
sheer
force
of
our
claims
we
men
have
opened
up
all
the
latent
possibilities
of
women
in
the
process
of
surrendering
themselves
to
us
they
have
ever
gained
their
true
greatness
because
they
had
to
bring
all
the
diamonds
of
their
happiness
and
the
pearls
of
their
sorrow
into
our
royal
treasury
they
have
found
their
true
wealth
so
for
men
to
accept
is
truly
to
give
for
women
to
give
is
truly
to
gain
the
demand
i
have
just
made
from
bimala
however
is
indeed
a
large
one
at
first
i
felt
scruples
for
is
it
not
the
habit
of
man
mind
to
be
in
purposeless
conflict
with
itself
i
thought
i
had
imposed
too
hard
a
task
my
first
impulse
was
to
call
her
back
and
tell
her
i
would
rather
not
make
her
life
wretched
by
dragging
her
into
all
these
troubles
i
forgot
for
the
moment
that
it
was
the
mission
of
man
to
be
aggressive
to
make
existence
fruitful
by
stirring
up
disquiet
in
the
depth
of
her
passivity
to
make
the
whole
world
blessed
by
churning
up
the
immeasurable
abyss
of
suffering
this
is
why
man
hands
are
so
strong
his
grip
so
firm
bimala
had
been
longing
with
all
her
heart
that
i
sandip
should
demand
of
her
some
great
sacrifice
should
call
her
to
her
death
how
else
could
she
be
happy
had
she
not
waited
all
these
weary
years
only
for
an
opportunity
to
weep
out
her
heart
so
satiated
was
she
with
the
monotony
of
her
placid
happiness
and
therefore
at
the
very
sight
of
me
her
heart
horizon
darkened
with
the
rain
clouds
of
her
impending
days
of
anguish
if
i
pity
her
and
save
her
from
her
sorrows
what
then
was
the
purpose
of
my
being
born
a
man
the
real
reason
of
my
qualms
is
that
my
demand
happens
to
be
for
money
that
savours
of
beggary
for
money
is
man
not
woman
that
is
why
i
had
to
make
it
a
big
figure
a
thousand
or
two
would
have
the
air
of
petty
theft
fifty
thousand
has
all
the
expanse
of
romantic
brigandage
ah
but
riches
should
really
have
been
mine
so
many
of
my
desires
have
had
to
halt
again
and
again
on
the
road
to
accomplishment
simply
for
want
of
money
this
does
not
become
me
had
my
fate
been
merely
unjust
it
could
be
forgiven
but
its
bad
taste
is
unpardonable
it
is
not
simply
a
hardship
that
a
man
like
me
should
be
at
his
end
to
pay
his
house
rent
or
should
have
to
carefully
count
out
the
coins
for
an
intermediate
class
railway
ticket
it
is
vulgar
it
is
equally
clear
that
nikhil
paternal
estates
are
a
superfluity
to
him
for
him
it
would
not
have
been
at
all
unbecoming
to
be
poor
he
would
have
cheerfully
pulled
in
the
double
harness
of
indigent
mediocrity
with
that
precious
master
of
his
i
should
love
to
have
just
for
once
the
chance
to
fling
about
fifty
thousand
rupees
in
the
service
of
my
country
and
to
the
satisfaction
of
myself
i
am
a
nabob
born
and
it
is
a
great
dream
of
mine
to
get
rid
of
this
disguise
of
poverty
though
it
be
for
a
day
only
and
to
see
myself
in
my
true
character
i
have
grave
misgivings
however
as
to
bimala
ever
getting
that
fifty
thousand
rupees
within
her
reach
and
it
will
probably
be
only
a
thousand
or
two
which
will
actually
come
to
hand
be
it
so
the
wise
man
is
content
with
half
a
loaf
or
any
fraction
for
that
matter
rather
than
no
bread
i
must
return
to
these
personal
reflections
of
mine
later
news
comes
that
i
am
wanted
at
once
something
has
gone
wrong
it
seems
that
the
police
have
got
a
clue
to
the
man
who
sank
mirjan
boat
for
us
he
was
an
old
offender
they
are
on
his
trail
but
he
should
be
too
practised
a
hand
to
be
caught
blabbing
however
one
never
knows
nikhil
back
is
up
and
his
manager
may
not
be
able
to
have
things
his
own
way
if
i
get
into
trouble
sir
said
the
manager
when
i
saw
him
i
shall
have
to
drag
you
in
where
is
the
noose
with
which
you
can
catch
me
i
asked
i
have
a
letter
of
yours
and
several
of
amulya
babu
i
could
not
see
that
the
letter
marked
urgent
to
which
i
had
been
hurried
into
writing
a
reply
was
wanted
urgently
for
this
purpose
only
i
am
getting
to
learn
quite
a
number
of
things
the
point
now
is
that
the
police
must
be
bribed
and
paid
to
mirjan
for
his
boat
it
is
also
becoming
evident
that
much
of
the
cost
of
this
patriotic
venture
of
ours
will
find
its
way
as
profit
into
the
pockets
of
nikhil
manager
however
i
must
shut
my
eyes
to
that
for
the
present
for
is
he
not
shouting
as
lustily
as
i
am
this
kind
of
work
has
always
to
be
carried
on
with
leaky
vessels
which
let
as
much
through
as
they
fetch
in
we
all
have
a
hidden
fund
of
moral
judgement
stored
away
within
us
and
so
i
was
about
to
wax
indignant
with
the
manager
and
enter
in
my
diary
a
tirade
against
the
unreliability
of
our
countrymen
but
if
there
be
a
god
i
must
acknowledge
with
gratitude
to
him
that
he
has
given
me
a
mind
which
allows
nothing
inside
or
outside
it
to
remain
vague
i
may
delude
others
but
never
myself
so
i
was
unable
to
continue
angry
whatever
is
true
is
neither
good
nor
bad
but
simply
true
and
that
is
science
a
lake
is
only
the
remnant
of
water
which
has
not
been
sucked
into
the
ground
underneath
the
cult
of
as
indeed
at
the
bottom
of
all
mundane
affairs
there
is
a
region
of
slime
whose
absorbing
power
must
be
reckoned
with
the
manager
will
take
what
he
wants
i
also
have
my
own
wants
these
lesser
wants
form
a
part
of
the
wants
of
the
great
cause
the
horse
must
be
fed
and
the
wheels
must
be
oiled
if
the
best
progress
is
to
be
made
the
long
and
short
of
it
is
that
money
we
must
have
and
that
soon
we
must
take
whatever
comes
the
readiest
for
we
can
not
afford
to
wait
i
know
that
the
immediate
often
swallows
up
the
ultimate
that
the
five
thousand
rupees
of
today
may
nip
in
the
bud
the
fifty
thousand
rupees
of
tomorrow
but
i
must
accept
the
penalty
have
i
not
often
twitted
nikhil
that
they
who
walk
in
the
paths
of
restraint
have
never
known
what
sacrifice
is
it
is
we
greedy
folk
who
have
to
sacrifice
our
greed
at
every
step
of
the
cardinal
sins
of
man
desire
is
for
men
who
are
men
but
delusion
which
is
only
for
cowards
hampers
them
because
delusion
keeps
them
wrapped
up
in
past
and
future
but
is
the
very
deuce
for
confounding
their
footsteps
in
the
present
those
who
are
always
straining
their
ears
for
the
call
of
the
remote
to
the
neglect
of
the
call
of
the
imminent
are
like
sakuntala
absorbed
in
the
memories
of
her
lover
the
guest
comes
unheeded
and
the
curse
descends
depriving
them
of
the
very
object
of
their
desire
the
other
day
i
pressed
bimala
hand
and
that
touch
still
stirs
her
mind
as
it
vibrates
in
mine
its
thrill
must
not
be
deadened
by
repetition
for
then
what
is
now
music
will
descend
to
mere
argument
there
is
at
present
no
room
in
her
mind
for
the
question
why
so
i
must
not
deprive
bimala
who
is
one
of
those
creatures
for
whom
illusion
is
necessary
of
her
full
supply
of
it
as
for
me
i
have
so
much
else
to
do
that
i
shall
have
to
be
content
for
the
present
with
the
foam
of
the
wine
cup
of
passion
o
man
of
desire
curb
your
greed
and
practise
your
hand
on
the
harp
of
illusion
till
you
can
bring
out
all
the
delicate
nuances
of
suggestion
this
is
not
the
time
to
drain
the
cup
to
the
dregs
sakuntala
after
the
king
her
lover
went
back
to
his
kingdom
promising
to
send
for
her
was
so
lost
in
thoughts
of
him
that
she
failed
to
hear
the
call
of
her
hermit
guest
who
thereupon
cursed
her
saying
that
the
object
of
her
love
would
forget
all
about
her
ix
our
work
proceeds
apace
but
though
we
have
shouted
ourselves
hoarse
proclaiming
the
mussulmans
to
be
our
brethren
we
have
come
to
realize
that
we
shall
never
be
able
to
bring
them
wholly
round
to
our
side
so
they
must
be
suppressed
altogether
and
made
to
understand
that
we
are
the
masters
they
are
now
showing
their
teeth
but
one
day
they
shall
dance
like
tame
bears
to
the
tune
we
play
if
the
idea
of
a
united
india
is
a
true
one
objects
nikhil
mussulmans
are
a
necessary
part
of
it
quite
so
said
i
but
we
must
know
their
place
and
keep
them
there
otherwise
they
will
constantly
be
giving
trouble
so
you
want
to
make
trouble
to
prevent
trouble
what
then
is
your
plan
there
is
only
one
way
of
avoiding
quarrels
said
nikhil
meaningly
i
know
that
like
tales
written
by
good
people
discourse
always
ends
in
a
moral
the
strange
part
of
it
is
that
with
all
his
familiarity
with
moral
precepts
he
still
believes
in
them
he
is
an
incorrigible
schoolboy
his
only
merit
is
his
sincerity
the
mischief
with
people
like
him
is
that
they
will
not
admit
the
finality
even
of
death
but
keep
their
eyes
always
fixed
on
a
hereafter
i
have
long
been
nursing
a
plan
which
if
only
i
could
carry
it
out
would
set
fire
to
the
whole
country
true
patriotism
will
never
be
roused
in
our
countrymen
unless
they
can
visualize
the
motherland
we
must
make
a
goddess
of
her
my
colleagues
saw
the
point
at
once
let
us
devise
an
appropriate
image
they
exclaimed
it
will
not
do
if
you
devise
it
i
admonished
them
we
must
get
one
of
the
current
images
accepted
as
representing
the
country
the
worship
of
the
people
must
flow
towards
it
along
the
grooves
of
custom
but
nikhil
needs
must
argue
even
about
this
we
must
not
seek
the
help
of
illusions
he
said
to
me
some
time
ago
for
what
we
believe
to
be
the
true
cause
illusions
are
necessary
for
lesser
minds
i
said
and
to
this
class
the
greater
portion
of
the
world
belongs
that
is
why
divinities
are
set
up
in
every
country
to
keep
up
the
illusions
of
the
people
for
men
are
only
too
well
aware
of
their
weakness
no
he
replied
god
is
necessary
to
clear
away
our
illusions
the
divinities
which
keep
them
alive
are
false
gods
what
of
that
if
need
be
even
false
gods
must
be
invoked
rather
than
let
the
work
suffer
unfortunately
for
us
our
illusions
are
alive
enough
but
we
do
not
know
how
to
make
them
serve
our
purpose
look
at
the
brahmins
in
spite
of
our
treating
them
as
and
untiringly
taking
the
dust
of
their
feet
they
are
a
force
going
to
waste
there
will
always
be
a
large
class
of
people
given
to
grovelling
who
can
never
be
made
to
do
anything
unless
they
are
bespattered
with
the
dust
of
somebody
feet
be
it
on
their
heads
or
on
their
backs
what
a
pity
if
after
keeping
brahmins
saved
up
in
our
armoury
for
all
these
ages
keen
and
serviceable
they
can
not
be
utilized
to
urge
on
this
rabble
in
the
time
of
our
need
but
it
is
impossible
to
drive
all
this
into
nikhil
head
he
has
such
a
prejudice
in
favour
of
truth
as
though
there
exists
such
an
objective
reality
how
often
have
i
tried
to
explain
to
him
that
where
untruth
truly
exists
there
it
is
indeed
the
truth
this
was
understood
in
our
country
in
the
old
days
and
so
they
had
the
courage
to
declare
that
for
those
of
little
understanding
untruth
is
the
truth
for
them
who
can
truly
believe
their
country
to
be
a
goddess
her
image
will
do
duty
for
the
truth
with
our
nature
and
our
traditions
we
are
unable
to
realize
our
country
as
she
is
but
we
can
easily
bring
ourselves
to
believe
in
her
image
those
who
want
to
do
real
work
must
not
ignore
this
fact
nikhil
only
got
excited
because
you
have
lost
the
power
of
walking
in
the
path
of
truth
attainment
he
cried
you
keep
waiting
for
some
miraculous
boon
to
drop
from
the
skies
that
is
why
when
your
service
to
the
country
has
fallen
centuries
into
arrears
all
you
can
think
of
is
to
make
of
it
an
image
and
stretch
out
your
hands
in
expectation
of
gratuitous
favours
we
want
to
perform
the
impossible
i
said
so
our
country
needs
must
be
made
into
a
god
you
mean
you
have
no
heart
for
possible
tasks
replied
nikhil
whatever
is
already
there
is
to
be
left
undisturbed
yet
there
must
be
a
supernatural
result
look
here
nikhil
i
said
at
length
thoroughly
exasperated
the
things
you
have
been
saying
are
good
enough
as
moral
lessons
these
ideas
have
served
their
purpose
as
milk
for
babes
at
one
stage
of
man
evolution
but
will
no
longer
do
now
that
man
has
cut
his
teeth
do
we
not
see
before
our
very
eyes
how
things
of
which
we
never
even
dreamt
of
sowing
the
seed
are
sprouting
up
on
every
side
by
what
power
that
of
the
deity
in
our
country
who
is
becoming
manifest
it
is
for
the
genius
of
the
age
to
give
that
deity
its
image
genius
does
not
argue
it
creates
i
only
give
form
to
what
the
country
imagines
i
will
spread
it
abroad
that
the
goddess
has
vouchsafed
me
a
dream
i
will
tell
the
brahmins
that
they
have
been
appointed
her
priests
and
that
their
downfall
has
been
due
to
their
dereliction
of
duty
in
not
seeing
to
the
proper
performance
of
her
worship
do
you
say
i
shall
be
uttering
lies
no
say
i
it
is
the
truth
nay
more
the
truth
which
the
country
has
so
long
been
waiting
to
learn
from
my
lips
if
only
i
could
get
the
opportunity
to
deliver
my
message
you
would
see
the
stupendous
result
what
i
am
afraid
of
said
nikhil
is
that
my
lifetime
is
limited
and
the
result
you
speak
of
is
not
the
final
result
it
will
have
which
may
not
be
immediately
apparent
i
only
seek
the
result
said
i
which
belongs
to
today
the
result
i
seek
answered
nikhil
belongs
to
all
time
nikhil
may
have
had
his
share
of
bengal
greatest
gift
imagination
but
he
has
allowed
it
to
be
overshadowed
and
nearly
killed
by
an
exotic
conscientiousness
just
look
at
the
worship
of
durga
which
bengal
has
carried
to
such
heights
that
is
one
of
her
greatest
achievements
i
can
swear
that
durga
is
a
political
goddess
and
was
conceived
as
the
image
of
the
of
patriotism
in
the
days
when
bengal
was
praying
to
be
delivered
from
mussulman
domination
what
other
province
of
india
has
succeeded
in
giving
such
wonderful
visual
expression
to
the
ideal
of
its
quest
nothing
betrayed
nikhil
loss
of
the
divine
gift
of
imagination
more
conclusively
than
his
reply
to
me
during
the
mussulman
domination
he
said
the
maratha
and
the
sikh
asked
for
fruit
from
the
arms
which
they
themselves
took
up
the
bengali
contented
himself
with
placing
weapons
in
the
hands
of
his
goddess
and
muttering
incantations
to
her
and
as
his
country
did
not
really
happen
to
be
a
goddess
the
only
fruit
he
got
was
the
heads
of
the
goats
and
buffaloes
of
the
sacrifice
the
day
that
we
seek
the
good
of
the
country
along
the
path
of
righteousness
he
who
is
greater
than
our
country
will
grant
us
true
fruition
the
unfortunate
part
of
it
is
that
nikhil
words
sound
so
fine
when
put
down
on
paper
my
words
however
are
not
meant
to
be
scribbled
on
paper
but
to
be
scored
into
the
heart
of
the
country
the
pandit
records
his
treatise
on
agriculture
in
printer
ink
but
the
cultivator
at
the
point
of
his
plough
impresses
his
endeavour
deep
in
the
soil
x
when
i
next
saw
bimala
i
pitched
my
key
high
without
further
ado
have
we
been
able
i
began
to
believe
with
all
our
heart
in
the
god
for
whose
worship
we
have
been
born
all
these
millions
of
years
until
he
actually
made
himself
visible
to
us
how
often
have
i
told
you
i
continued
that
had
i
not
seen
you
i
never
would
have
known
all
my
country
as
one
i
know
not
yet
whether
you
rightly
understand
me
the
gods
are
invisible
only
in
their
heaven
on
earth
they
show
themselves
to
mortal
men
bimala
looked
at
me
in
a
strange
kind
of
way
as
she
gravely
replied
indeed
i
understand
you
sandip
this
was
the
first
time
she
called
me
plain
sandip
krishna
i
continued
whom
arjuna
ordinarily
knew
only
as
the
driver
of
his
chariot
had
also
his
universal
aspect
of
which
too
arjuna
had
a
vision
one
day
and
that
day
he
saw
the
truth
i
have
seen
your
universal
aspect
in
my
country
the
ganges
and
the
brahmaputra
are
the
chains
of
gold
that
wind
round
and
round
your
neck
in
the
woodland
fringes
on
the
distant
banks
of
the
dark
waters
of
the
river
i
have
seen
your
eyelashes
the
changeful
sheen
of
your
moves
for
me
in
the
play
of
light
and
shade
amongst
the
swaying
shoots
of
green
corn
and
the
blazing
summer
heat
which
makes
the
whole
sky
lie
gasping
like
a
lion
in
the
desert
is
nothing
but
your
cruel
radiance
since
the
goddess
has
vouchsafed
her
presence
to
her
votary
in
such
wonderful
guise
it
is
for
me
to
proclaim
her
worship
throughout
our
land
and
then
shall
the
country
gain
new
life
image
make
we
in
temple
after
temple
but
this
our
people
have
not
yet
fully
realized
so
i
would
call
on
them
in
your
name
and
offer
for
their
worship
an
image
from
which
none
shall
be
able
to
withhold
belief
oh
give
me
this
boon
this
power
bimala
eyelids
drooped
and
she
became
rigid
in
her
seat
like
a
figure
of
stone
had
i
continued
she
would
have
gone
off
into
a
trance
when
i
ceased
speaking
she
opened
wide
her
eyes
and
murmured
with
fixed
gaze
as
though
still
dazed
o
traveller
in
the
path
of
destruction
who
is
there
that
can
stay
your
progress
do
i
not
see
that
none
shall
stand
in
the
way
of
your
desires
kings
shall
lay
their
crowns
at
your
feet
the
wealthy
shall
hasten
to
throw
open
their
treasure
for
your
acceptance
those
who
have
nothing
else
shall
beg
to
be
allowed
to
offer
their
lives
o
my
king
my
god
what
you
have
seen
in
me
i
know
not
but
i
have
seen
the
immensity
of
your
grandeur
in
my
heart
who
am
i
what
am
i
in
its
presence
ah
the
awful
power
of
devastation
never
shall
i
truly
live
till
it
kills
me
utterly
i
can
bear
it
no
longer
my
heart
is
breaking
bimala
slid
down
from
her
seat
and
fell
at
my
feet
which
she
clasped
and
then
she
sobbed
and
sobbed
and
sobbed
this
is
hypnotism
indeed
the
charm
which
can
subdue
the
world
no
materials
no
weapons
but
just
the
delusion
of
irresistible
suggestion
who
says
truth
shall
triumph
delusion
shall
win
in
the
end
the
bengali
understood
this
when
he
conceived
the
image
of
the
goddess
astride
her
lion
and
spread
her
worship
in
the
land
bengal
must
now
create
a
new
image
to
enchant
and
conquer
the
world
i
gently
lifted
bimala
back
into
her
chair
and
lest
reaction
should
set
in
i
began
again
without
losing
time
queen
the
divine
mother
has
laid
on
me
the
duty
of
establishing
her
worship
in
the
land
but
alas
i
am
poor
bimala
was
still
flushed
her
eyes
clouded
her
accents
thick
as
she
replied
you
poor
is
not
all
that
each
one
has
yours
what
are
my
caskets
full
of
jewellery
for
drag
away
from
me
all
my
gold
and
gems
for
your
worship
i
have
no
use
for
them
once
before
bimala
had
offered
up
her
ornaments
i
am
not
usually
in
the
habit
of
drawing
lines
but
i
felt
i
had
to
draw
the
line
there
i
know
why
i
feel
this
hesitation
it
is
for
man
to
give
ornaments
to
woman
to
take
them
from
her
wounds
his
manliness
but
i
must
forget
myself
am
i
taking
them
they
are
for
the
divine
mother
to
be
poured
in
worship
at
her
feet
oh
but
it
must
be
a
grand
ceremony
of
worship
such
as
the
country
has
never
beheld
before
it
must
be
a
landmark
in
our
history
it
shall
be
my
supreme
legacy
to
the
nation
ignorant
men
worship
gods
i
sandip
shall
create
them
but
all
this
is
a
far
cry
what
about
the
urgent
immediate
at
least
three
thousand
is
indispensably
necessary
five
thousand
would
do
roundly
and
nicely
but
how
on
earth
am
i
to
mention
money
after
the
high
flight
we
have
just
taken
and
yet
time
is
precious
i
crushed
all
hesitation
under
foot
as
i
jumped
up
and
made
my
plunge
queen
our
purse
is
empty
our
work
about
to
stop
bimala
winced
i
could
see
she
was
thinking
of
that
impossible
fifty
thousand
rupees
what
a
load
she
must
have
been
carrying
within
her
bosom
struggling
under
it
perhaps
through
sleepless
nights
what
else
had
she
with
which
to
express
her
loving
worship
debarred
from
offering
her
heart
at
my
feet
she
hankers
to
make
this
sum
of
money
so
hopelessly
large
for
her
the
bearer
of
her
imprisoned
feelings
the
thought
of
what
she
must
have
gone
through
gives
me
a
twinge
of
pain
for
she
is
now
wholly
mine
the
wrench
of
plucking
up
the
plant
by
the
roots
is
over
it
is
now
only
careful
tending
and
nurture
that
is
needed
queen
said
i
that
fifty
thousand
rupees
is
not
particularly
wanted
just
now
i
calculate
that
for
the
present
five
thousand
or
even
three
will
serve
the
relief
made
her
heart
rebound
i
shall
fetch
you
five
thousand
she
said
in
tones
which
seemed
like
an
outburst
of
song
the
song
which
radhika
of
the
vaishnava
lyrics
sang
for
my
lover
will
i
bind
in
my
hair
the
flower
which
has
no
equal
in
the
three
worlds
it
is
the
same
tune
the
same
song
five
thousand
will
i
bring
that
flower
will
i
bind
in
my
hair
the
narrow
restraint
of
the
flute
brings
out
this
quality
of
song
i
must
not
allow
the
pressure
of
too
much
greed
to
flatten
out
the
reed
for
then
as
i
fear
music
will
give
place
to
the
questions
why
what
is
the
use
of
so
much
how
am
i
to
get
it
not
a
word
of
which
will
rhyme
with
what
radhika
sang
so
as
i
was
saying
illusion
alone
is
real
it
is
the
flute
itself
while
truth
is
but
its
empty
hollow
nikhil
has
of
late
got
a
taste
of
that
pure
emptiness
one
can
see
it
in
his
face
which
pains
even
me
but
it
was
nikhil
boast
that
he
wanted
the
truth
while
mine
was
that
i
would
never
let
go
illusion
from
my
grasp
each
has
been
suited
to
his
taste
so
why
complain
to
keep
bimala
heart
in
the
rarefied
air
of
idealism
i
cut
short
all
further
discussion
over
the
five
thousand
rupees
i
reverted
to
the
goddess
and
her
worship
when
was
the
ceremony
to
be
held
and
where
there
is
a
great
annual
fair
at
ruimari
within
nikhil
estates
where
hundreds
of
thousands
of
pilgrims
assemble
that
would
be
a
grand
place
to
inaugurate
the
worship
of
our
goddess
bimala
waxed
intensely
enthusiastic
this
was
not
the
burning
of
foreign
cloth
or
the
people
granaries
so
even
nikhil
could
have
no
objection
so
thought
she
but
i
smiled
inwardly
how
little
these
two
persons
who
have
been
together
day
and
night
for
nine
whole
years
know
of
each
other
they
know
something
perhaps
of
their
home
life
but
when
it
comes
to
outside
concerns
they
are
entirely
at
sea
they
had
cherished
the
belief
that
the
harmony
of
the
home
with
the
outside
was
perfect
today
they
realize
to
their
cost
that
it
is
too
late
to
repair
their
neglect
of
years
and
seek
to
harmonize
them
now
what
does
it
matter
let
those
who
have
made
the
mistake
learn
their
error
by
knocking
against
the
world
why
need
i
bother
about
their
plight
for
the
present
i
find
it
wearisome
to
keep
bimala
soaring
much
longer
like
a
captive
balloon
in
regions
ethereal
i
had
better
get
quite
through
with
the
matter
in
hand
when
bimala
rose
to
depart
and
had
neared
the
door
i
remarked
in
my
most
casual
manner
so
about
the
money
bimala
halted
and
faced
back
as
she
said
on
the
expiry
of
the
month
when
our
personal
allowances
become
due
that
i
am
afraid
would
be
much
too
late
when
do
you
want
it
then
tomorrow
tomorrow
you
shall
have
it
a
line
from
bankim
chatterjee
national
song
a
quotation
from
the
upanishads
there
is
a
world
of
sentiment
attached
to
the
ornaments
worn
by
women
in
bengal
they
are
not
merely
indicative
of
the
love
and
regard
of
the
giver
but
the
wearing
of
them
symbolizes
all
that
is
held
best
in
wifehood
the
constant
solicitude
for
her
husband
welfare
the
successful
performance
of
the
material
and
spiritual
duties
of
the
household
entrusted
to
her
care
when
the
husband
dies
and
the
responsibility
for
the
household
changes
hands
then
are
all
ornaments
cast
aside
as
a
sign
of
the
widow
renunciation
of
worldly
concerns
at
any
other
time
the
giving
up
of
omaments
is
always
a
sign
of
supreme
distress
and
as
such
appeals
acutely
to
the
sense
of
chivalry
of
any
bengali
who
may
happen
to
witness
it
chapter
eight
nikhil
story
x
paragraphs
and
letters
against
me
have
begun
to
come
out
in
the
local
papers
cartoons
and
lampoons
are
to
follow
i
am
told
jets
of
wit
and
humour
are
being
splashed
about
and
the
lies
thus
scattered
are
convulsing
the
whole
country
they
know
that
the
monopoly
of
is
theirs
and
the
innocent
by
can
not
escape
unsoiled
they
are
saying
that
the
residents
in
my
estates
from
the
highest
to
the
lowest
are
in
favour
of
but
they
dare
not
declare
themselves
for
fear
of
me
the
few
who
have
been
brave
enough
to
defy
me
have
felt
the
full
rigour
of
my
persecution
i
am
in
secret
league
with
the
police
and
in
private
communication
with
the
magistrate
and
these
frantic
efforts
of
mine
to
add
a
foreign
title
of
my
own
earning
to
the
one
i
have
inherited
will
not
it
is
opined
go
in
vain
on
the
other
hand
the
papers
are
full
of
praise
for
those
devoted
sons
of
the
motherland
the
kundu
and
the
chakravarti
if
only
say
they
the
country
had
a
few
more
of
such
staunch
patriots
the
mills
of
manchester
would
have
had
to
sound
their
own
dirge
to
the
tune
of
then
comes
a
letter
in
ink
giving
a
list
of
the
traitorous
whose
treasuries
have
been
burnt
down
because
of
their
failing
to
support
the
cause
holy
fire
it
goes
on
to
say
has
been
aroused
to
its
sacred
function
of
purifying
the
country
and
other
agencies
are
also
at
work
to
see
that
those
who
are
not
true
sons
of
the
motherland
do
cease
to
encumber
her
lap
the
signature
is
an
obvious
i
could
see
that
this
was
the
doing
of
our
local
students
so
i
sent
for
some
of
them
and
showed
them
the
letter
the
student
gravely
informed
me
that
they
also
had
heard
that
a
band
of
desperate
patriots
had
been
formed
who
would
stick
at
nothing
in
order
to
clear
away
all
obstacles
to
the
success
of
if
said
i
even
one
of
our
countrymen
succumbs
to
these
overbearing
desperadoes
that
will
indeed
be
a
defeat
for
the
country
we
fail
to
follow
you
maharaja
said
the
history
student
country
i
tried
to
explain
has
been
brought
to
door
through
sheer
fear
from
fear
of
the
gods
down
to
fear
of
the
police
and
if
you
set
up
in
the
name
of
freedom
the
fear
of
some
other
bogey
whatever
it
may
be
called
if
you
would
raise
your
victorious
standard
on
the
cowardice
of
the
country
by
means
of
downright
oppression
then
no
true
lover
of
the
country
can
bow
to
your
decision
is
there
any
country
sir
pursued
the
history
student
where
submission
to
government
is
not
due
to
fear
the
freedom
that
exists
in
any
country
i
replied
may
be
measured
by
the
extent
of
this
reign
of
fear
where
its
threat
is
confined
to
those
who
would
hurt
or
plunder
there
the
government
may
claim
to
have
freed
man
from
the
violence
of
man
but
if
fear
is
to
regulate
how
people
are
to
dress
where
they
shall
trade
or
what
they
must
eat
then
is
man
freedom
of
will
utterly
ignored
and
manhood
destroyed
at
the
root
is
not
such
coercion
of
the
individual
will
seen
in
other
countries
too
continued
the
history
student
who
denies
it
i
exclaimed
but
in
every
country
man
has
destroyed
himself
to
the
extent
that
he
has
permitted
slavery
to
flourish
does
it
not
rather
show
interposed
a
master
of
arts
that
trading
in
slavery
is
inherent
in
man
a
fundamental
fact
of
his
nature
sandip
babu
made
the
whole
thing
clear
said
a
graduate
he
gave
us
the
example
of
harish
kundu
your
neighbouring
from
his
estates
you
can
not
ferret
out
a
single
ounce
of
foreign
salt
why
because
he
has
always
ruled
with
an
iron
hand
in
the
case
of
those
who
are
slaves
by
nature
the
lack
of
a
strong
master
is
the
greatest
of
all
calamities
why
sir
chimed
in
an
undergraduate
have
you
not
heard
of
the
obstreperous
tenant
of
chakravarti
the
other
close
by
how
the
law
was
set
on
him
till
he
was
reduced
to
utter
destitution
when
at
last
he
was
left
with
nothing
to
eat
he
started
out
to
sell
his
wife
silver
ornaments
but
no
one
dared
buy
them
then
chakravarti
manager
offered
him
five
rupees
for
the
lot
they
were
worth
over
thirty
but
he
had
to
accept
or
starve
after
taking
over
the
bundle
from
him
the
manager
coolly
said
that
those
five
rupees
would
be
credited
towards
his
rent
we
felt
like
having
nothing
more
to
do
with
chakravarti
or
his
manager
after
that
but
sandip
babu
told
us
that
if
we
threw
over
all
the
live
people
we
should
have
only
dead
bodies
from
the
to
carry
on
the
work
with
these
live
men
he
pointed
out
know
what
they
want
and
how
to
get
it
they
are
born
rulers
those
who
do
not
know
how
to
desire
for
themselves
must
live
in
accordance
with
or
die
by
virtue
of
the
desires
of
such
as
these
sandip
babu
contrasted
them
kundu
and
chakravarti
with
you
maharaja
you
he
said
for
all
your
good
intentions
will
never
succeed
in
planting
within
your
territory
it
is
my
desire
i
said
to
plant
something
greater
than
i
am
not
after
dead
logs
but
living
trees
and
these
will
take
time
to
grow
i
am
afraid
sir
sneered
the
history
student
that
you
will
get
neither
log
nor
tree
sandip
babu
rightly
teaches
that
in
order
to
get
you
must
snatch
this
is
taking
all
of
us
some
time
to
learn
because
it
runs
counter
to
what
we
were
taught
at
school
i
have
seen
with
my
own
eyes
that
when
a
of
harish
kundu
found
one
of
the
tenants
with
nothing
which
could
be
sold
up
to
pay
his
rent
he
was
made
to
sell
his
young
wife
buyers
were
not
wanting
and
the
demand
was
satisfied
i
tell
you
sir
the
sight
of
that
man
distress
prevented
my
getting
sleep
for
nights
together
but
feel
it
as
i
did
this
much
i
realized
that
the
man
who
knows
how
to
get
the
money
he
is
out
for
even
by
selling
up
his
debtor
wife
is
a
better
man
than
i
am
i
confess
it
is
beyond
me
i
am
a
weakling
my
eyes
fill
with
tears
if
anybody
can
save
our
country
it
is
these
kundus
and
these
chakravartis
and
their
officials
i
was
shocked
beyond
words
if
what
you
say
be
true
i
cried
i
clearly
see
that
it
must
be
the
one
endeavour
of
my
life
to
save
the
country
from
these
same
kundus
and
chakravartis
and
officials
the
slavery
that
has
entered
into
our
very
bones
is
breaking
out
at
this
opportunity
as
ghastly
tyranny
you
have
been
so
used
to
submit
to
domination
through
fear
you
have
come
to
believe
that
to
make
others
submit
is
a
kind
of
religion
my
fight
shall
be
against
this
weakness
this
atrocious
cruelty
these
things
which
are
so
simple
to
ordinary
folk
get
so
twisted
in
the
minds
of
our
and
the
only
purpose
of
whose
historical
quibbles
seems
to
be
to
torture
the
truth
xi
i
am
worried
over
panchu
sham
aunt
it
will
be
difficult
to
disprove
her
for
though
witnesses
of
a
real
event
may
be
few
or
even
wanting
innumerable
proofs
of
a
thing
that
has
not
happened
can
always
be
marshalled
the
object
of
this
move
is
evidently
to
get
the
sale
of
panchu
holding
to
me
set
aside
being
unable
to
find
any
other
way
out
of
it
i
was
thinking
of
allowing
panchu
to
hold
a
permanent
tenure
in
my
estates
and
building
him
a
cottage
on
it
but
my
master
would
not
have
it
i
should
not
give
in
to
these
nefarious
tactics
so
easily
he
objected
and
offered
to
attend
to
the
matter
himself
you
sir
i
cried
considerably
surprised
yes
i
he
repeated
i
could
not
see
at
all
clearly
what
my
master
could
do
to
counteract
these
legal
machinations
that
evening
at
the
time
he
usually
came
to
me
he
did
not
turn
up
on
my
making
inquiries
his
servant
said
he
had
left
home
with
a
few
things
packed
in
a
small
trunk
and
some
bedding
saying
he
would
be
back
in
a
few
days
i
thought
he
might
have
sallied
forth
to
hunt
for
witnesses
in
panchu
uncle
village
in
that
case
however
i
was
sure
that
his
would
be
a
hopeless
quest
during
the
day
i
forget
myself
in
my
work
as
the
late
autumn
afternoon
wears
on
the
colours
of
the
sky
become
turbid
and
so
do
the
feelings
of
my
mind
there
are
many
in
this
world
whose
minds
dwell
in
houses
they
can
afford
to
ignore
the
thing
called
the
outside
but
my
mind
lives
under
the
trees
in
the
open
directly
receives
upon
itself
the
messages
borne
by
the
free
winds
and
responds
from
the
bottom
of
its
heart
to
all
the
musical
cadences
of
light
and
darkness
while
the
day
is
bright
and
the
world
in
the
pursuit
of
its
numberless
tasks
crowds
around
then
it
seems
as
if
my
life
wants
nothing
else
but
when
the
colours
of
the
sky
fade
away
and
the
blinds
are
drawn
down
over
the
windows
of
heaven
then
my
heart
tells
me
that
evening
falls
just
for
the
purpose
of
shutting
out
the
world
to
mark
the
time
when
the
darkness
must
be
filled
with
the
one
this
is
the
end
to
which
earth
sky
and
waters
conspire
and
i
can
not
harden
myself
against
accepting
its
meaning
so
when
the
gloaming
deepens
over
the
world
like
the
gaze
of
the
dark
eyes
of
the
beloved
then
my
whole
being
tells
me
that
work
alone
can
not
be
the
truth
of
life
that
work
is
not
the
and
the
of
man
for
man
is
not
simply
a
serf
even
though
the
serfdom
be
of
the
true
and
the
good
alas
nikhil
have
you
for
ever
parted
company
with
that
self
of
yours
who
used
to
be
set
free
under
the
starlight
to
plunge
into
the
infinite
depths
of
the
night
darkness
after
the
day
work
was
done
how
terribly
alone
is
he
who
misses
companionship
in
the
midst
of
the
multitudinousness
of
life
the
other
day
when
the
afternoon
had
reached
the
of
day
and
night
i
had
no
work
nor
the
mind
for
work
nor
was
my
master
there
to
keep
me
company
with
my
empty
drifting
heart
longing
to
anchor
on
to
something
i
traced
my
steps
towards
the
inner
gardens
i
was
very
fond
of
chrysanthemums
and
had
rows
of
them
of
all
varieties
banked
up
in
pots
against
one
of
the
garden
walls
when
they
were
in
flower
it
looked
like
a
wave
of
green
breaking
into
iridescent
foam
it
was
some
time
since
i
had
been
to
this
part
of
the
grounds
and
i
was
beguiled
into
a
cheerful
expectancy
at
the
thought
of
meeting
my
chrysanthemums
after
our
long
separation
as
i
went
in
the
full
moon
had
just
peeped
over
the
wall
her
slanting
rays
leaving
its
foot
in
deep
shadow
it
seemed
as
if
she
had
come
from
behind
and
clasped
the
darkness
over
the
eyes
smiling
mischievously
when
i
came
near
the
bank
of
chrysanthemums
i
saw
a
figure
stretched
on
the
grass
in
front
my
heart
gave
a
sudden
thud
the
figure
also
sat
up
with
a
start
at
my
footsteps
what
was
to
be
done
next
i
was
wondering
whether
it
would
do
to
beat
a
precipitate
retreat
bimala
also
was
doubtless
casting
about
for
some
way
of
escape
but
it
was
as
awkward
to
go
as
to
stay
before
i
could
make
up
my
mind
bimala
rose
pulled
the
end
of
her
over
her
head
and
walked
off
towards
the
inner
apartments
this
brief
pause
had
been
enough
to
make
real
to
me
the
cruel
load
of
bimala
misery
the
plaint
of
my
own
life
vanished
from
me
in
a
moment
i
called
out
bimala
she
started
and
stayed
her
steps
but
did
not
turn
back
i
went
round
and
stood
before
her
her
face
was
in
the
shade
the
moonlight
fell
on
mine
her
eyes
were
downcast
her
hands
clenched
bimala
said
i
why
should
i
seek
to
keep
you
fast
in
this
closed
cage
of
mine
do
i
not
know
that
thus
you
can
not
but
pine
and
droop
she
stood
still
without
raising
her
eyes
or
uttering
a
word
i
know
i
continued
that
if
i
insist
on
keeping
you
shackled
my
whole
life
will
be
reduced
to
nothing
but
an
iron
chain
what
pleasure
can
that
be
to
me
she
was
still
silent
so
i
concluded
i
tell
you
truly
bimala
you
are
free
whatever
i
may
or
may
not
have
been
to
you
i
refuse
to
be
your
fetters
with
which
i
came
away
towards
the
outer
apartments
no
no
it
was
not
a
generous
impulse
nor
indifference
i
had
simply
come
to
understand
that
never
would
i
be
free
until
i
could
set
free
to
try
to
keep
bimala
as
a
garland
round
my
neck
would
have
meant
keeping
a
weight
hanging
over
my
heart
have
i
not
been
praying
with
all
my
strength
that
if
happiness
may
not
be
mine
let
it
go
if
grief
needs
must
be
my
lot
let
it
come
but
let
me
not
be
kept
in
bondage
to
clutch
hold
of
that
which
is
untrue
as
though
it
were
true
is
only
to
throttle
oneself
may
i
be
saved
from
such
when
i
entered
my
room
i
found
my
master
waiting
there
my
agitated
feelings
were
still
heaving
within
me
freedom
sir
i
began
unceremoniously
without
greeting
or
inquiry
freedom
is
the
biggest
thing
for
man
nothing
can
be
compared
to
it
nothing
at
all
surprised
at
my
outburst
my
master
looked
up
at
me
in
silence
one
can
understand
nothing
from
books
i
went
on
we
read
in
the
scriptures
that
our
desires
are
bonds
fettering
us
as
well
as
others
but
such
words
by
themselves
are
so
empty
it
is
only
when
we
get
to
the
point
of
letting
the
bird
out
of
its
cage
that
we
can
realize
how
free
the
bird
has
set
us
whatever
we
cage
shackles
us
with
desire
whose
bonds
are
stronger
than
those
of
iron
chains
i
tell
you
sir
this
is
just
what
the
world
has
failed
to
understand
they
all
seek
to
reform
something
outside
themselves
but
reform
is
wanted
only
in
one
own
desires
nowhere
else
nowhere
else
we
think
he
said
that
we
are
our
own
masters
when
we
get
in
our
hands
the
object
of
our
desire
but
we
are
really
our
own
masters
only
when
we
are
able
to
cast
out
our
desires
from
our
minds
when
we
put
all
this
into
words
sir
i
went
on
it
sounds
like
some
injunction
but
when
we
realize
even
a
little
of
it
we
find
it
to
be
which
the
gods
have
drunk
and
become
immortal
we
can
not
see
beauty
till
we
let
go
our
hold
of
it
it
was
buddha
who
conquered
the
world
not
alexander
this
is
untrue
when
stated
in
dry
prose
oh
when
shall
we
be
able
to
sing
it
when
shall
all
these
most
intimate
truths
of
the
universe
overflow
the
pages
of
printed
books
and
leap
out
in
a
sacred
stream
like
the
ganges
from
the
gangotrie
i
was
suddenly
reminded
of
my
master
absence
during
the
last
few
days
and
of
my
ignorance
as
to
its
reason
i
felt
somewhat
foolish
as
i
asked
him
and
where
have
you
been
all
this
while
sir
staying
with
panchu
he
replied
indeed
i
exclaimed
have
you
been
there
all
these
days
yes
i
wanted
to
come
to
an
understanding
with
the
woman
who
calls
herself
his
aunt
she
could
hardly
be
induced
to
believe
that
there
could
be
such
an
odd
character
among
the
gentlefolk
as
the
one
who
sought
their
hospitality
when
she
found
i
really
meant
to
stay
on
she
began
to
feel
rather
ashamed
of
herself
said
i
are
not
going
to
get
rid
of
me
even
if
you
abuse
me
and
so
long
as
i
stay
panchu
stays
also
for
you
see
do
you
not
that
i
can
not
stand
by
and
see
his
motherless
little
ones
sent
out
into
the
streets
she
listened
to
my
talks
in
this
strain
for
a
couple
of
days
without
saying
yes
or
no
this
morning
i
found
her
tying
up
her
bundles
are
going
back
to
brindaban
she
said
us
have
our
expenses
for
the
journey
i
knew
she
was
not
going
to
brindaban
and
also
that
the
cost
of
her
journey
would
be
substantial
so
i
have
come
to
you
the
required
cost
shall
be
paid
i
said
the
old
woman
is
not
a
bad
sort
my
master
went
on
musingly
panchu
was
not
sure
of
her
caste
and
would
not
let
her
touch
the
or
anything
at
all
of
his
so
they
were
continually
bickering
when
she
found
i
had
no
objection
to
her
touch
she
looked
after
me
devotedly
she
is
a
splendid
cook
but
all
remnants
of
panchu
respect
for
me
vanished
to
the
last
he
had
thought
that
i
was
at
least
a
simple
sort
of
person
but
here
was
i
risking
my
caste
without
a
qualm
to
win
over
the
old
woman
for
my
purpose
had
i
tried
to
steal
a
march
on
her
by
tutoring
a
witness
for
the
trial
that
would
have
been
a
different
matter
tactics
must
be
met
by
tactics
but
stratagem
at
the
expense
of
orthodoxy
is
more
than
he
can
tolerate
anyhow
i
must
stay
on
a
few
days
at
panchu
even
after
the
woman
leaves
for
harish
kundu
may
be
up
to
any
kind
of
devilry
he
has
been
telling
his
satellites
that
he
was
content
to
have
furnished
panchu
with
an
aunt
but
i
have
gone
the
length
of
supplying
him
with
a
father
he
would
like
to
see
now
how
many
fathers
of
his
can
save
him
we
may
or
may
not
be
able
to
save
him
i
said
but
if
we
should
perish
in
the
attempt
to
save
the
country
from
the
snares
of
religion
custom
and
selfishness
which
these
people
are
busy
spreading
we
shall
at
least
die
happy

xiv
who
could
have
thought
that
so
much
would
happen
in
this
one
life
i
feel
as
if
i
have
passed
through
a
whole
series
of
births
time
has
been
flying
so
fast
i
did
not
feel
it
move
at
all
till
the
shock
came
the
other
day
i
knew
there
would
be
words
between
us
when
i
made
up
my
mind
to
ask
my
husband
to
banish
foreign
goods
from
our
market
but
it
was
my
firm
belief
that
i
had
no
need
to
meet
argument
by
argument
for
there
was
magic
in
the
very
air
about
me
had
not
so
tremendous
a
man
as
sandip
fallen
helplessly
at
my
feet
like
a
wave
of
the
mighty
sea
breaking
on
the
shore
had
i
called
him
no
it
was
the
summons
of
that
magic
spell
of
mine
and
amulya
poor
dear
boy
when
he
first
came
to
me
how
the
current
of
his
life
flushed
with
colour
like
the
river
at
dawn
truly
have
i
realized
how
a
goddess
feels
when
she
looks
upon
the
radiant
face
of
her
devotee
with
the
confidence
begotten
of
these
proofs
of
my
power
i
was
ready
to
meet
my
husband
like
a
cloud
but
what
was
it
that
happened
never
in
all
these
nine
years
have
i
seen
such
a
distraught
look
in
his
eyes
like
the
desert
sky
with
no
merciful
moisture
of
its
own
no
colour
reflected
even
from
what
it
looked
upon
i
should
have
been
so
relieved
if
his
anger
had
flashed
out
but
i
could
find
nothing
in
him
which
i
could
touch
i
felt
as
unreal
as
a
dream
a
dream
which
would
leave
only
the
blackness
of
night
when
it
was
over
in
the
old
days
i
used
to
be
jealous
of
my
for
her
beauty
then
i
used
to
feel
that
providence
had
given
me
no
power
of
my
own
that
my
whole
strength
lay
in
the
love
which
my
husband
had
bestowed
on
me
now
that
i
had
drained
to
the
dregs
the
cup
of
power
and
could
not
do
without
its
intoxication
i
suddenly
found
it
dashed
to
pieces
at
my
feet
leaving
me
nothing
to
live
for
how
feverishly
i
had
sat
to
do
my
hair
that
day
oh
shame
shame
on
me
the
utter
shame
of
it
my
when
passing
by
had
exclaimed
aha
chota
rani
your
hair
seems
ready
to
jump
off
do
let
it
carry
your
head
with
it
and
then
the
other
day
in
the
garden
how
easy
my
husband
found
it
to
tell
me
that
he
set
me
free
but
can
freedom
empty
freedom
be
given
and
taken
so
easily
as
all
that
it
is
like
setting
a
fish
free
in
the
sky
for
how
can
i
move
or
live
outside
the
atmosphere
of
loving
care
which
has
always
sustained
me
when
i
came
to
my
room
today
i
saw
only
furniture
only
the
bedstead
only
the
only
the
not
the
heart
which
used
to
be
there
over
all
instead
of
it
there
was
freedom
only
freedom
mere
emptiness
a
watercourse
with
all
its
rocks
and
pebbles
laid
bare
no
feeling
only
furniture
when
i
had
arrived
at
a
state
of
utter
bewilderment
wondering
whether
anything
true
was
left
in
my
life
and
whereabouts
it
could
be
i
happened
to
meet
sandip
again
then
life
struck
against
life
and
the
sparks
flew
in
the
same
old
way
here
was
truth
impetuous
truth
which
rushed
in
and
overflowed
all
bounds
truth
which
was
a
thousand
times
truer
than
the
bara
rani
with
her
maid
thako
and
her
silly
songs
and
all
the
rest
of
them
who
talked
and
laughed
and
wandered
about
fifty
thousand
sandip
had
demanded
what
is
fifty
thousand
cried
my
intoxicated
heart
you
shall
have
it
how
to
get
it
where
to
get
it
were
minor
points
not
worth
troubling
over
look
at
me
had
i
not
risen
all
in
one
moment
from
my
nothingness
to
a
height
above
everything
so
shall
all
things
come
at
my
beck
and
call
i
shall
get
it
get
it
get
it
there
can
not
be
any
doubt
thus
had
i
come
away
from
sandip
the
other
day
then
as
i
looked
about
me
where
was
it
the
tree
of
plenty
oh
why
does
this
outer
world
insult
the
heart
so
and
yet
get
it
i
must
how
i
do
not
care
for
sin
there
can
not
be
sin
taints
only
the
weak
i
with
my
am
beyond
its
reach
only
a
commoner
can
be
a
thief
the
king
conquers
and
takes
his
rightful
spoil
i
must
find
out
where
the
treasury
is
who
takes
the
money
in
who
guards
it
i
spent
half
the
night
standing
in
the
outer
verandah
peering
at
the
row
of
office
buildings
but
how
to
get
that
fifty
thousand
rupees
out
of
the
clutches
of
those
iron
bars
if
by
some
i
could
have
made
all
those
guards
fall
dead
in
their
places
i
would
not
have
hesitated
so
pitiless
did
i
feel
but
while
a
whole
gang
of
robbers
seemed
dancing
a
within
the
whirling
brain
of
its
rani
the
great
house
of
the
rajas
slept
in
peace
the
gong
of
the
watch
sounded
hour
after
hour
and
the
sky
overhead
placidly
looked
on
at
last
i
sent
for
amulya
money
is
wanted
for
the
cause
i
told
him
can
you
not
get
it
out
of
the
treasury
why
not
said
he
with
his
chest
thrown
out
alas
had
i
not
said
why
not
to
sandip
just
in
the
same
way
the
poor
lad
confidence
could
rouse
no
hopes
in
my
mind
how
will
you
do
it
i
asked
the
wild
plans
he
began
to
unfold
would
hardly
bear
repetition
outside
the
pages
of
a
penny
dreadful
no
amulya
i
said
severely
you
must
not
be
childish
very
well
then
he
said
let
me
bribe
those
watchmen
where
is
the
money
to
come
from
i
can
loot
the
bazar
he
burst
out
without
blenching
leave
all
that
alone
i
have
my
ornaments
they
will
serve
but
said
amulya
it
strikes
me
that
the
cashier
can
not
be
bribed
never
mind
there
is
another
and
simpler
way
what
is
that
why
need
you
hear
it
it
is
quite
simple
still
i
should
like
to
know
amulya
fumbled
in
the
pocket
of
his
tunic
and
pulled
out
first
a
small
edition
of
the
which
he
placed
on
the
table
and
then
a
little
pistol
which
he
showed
me
but
said
nothing
further
horror
it
did
not
take
him
a
moment
to
make
up
his
mind
to
kill
our
good
old
cashier
to
look
at
his
frank
open
face
one
would
not
have
thought
him
capable
of
hurting
a
fly
but
how
different
were
the
words
which
came
from
his
mouth
it
was
clear
that
the
cashier
place
in
the
world
meant
nothing
real
to
him
it
was
a
mere
vacancy
lifeless
feelingless
with
only
stock
phrases
from
the
who
kills
the
body
kills
naught
whatever
do
you
mean
amulya
i
exclaimed
at
length
you
know
that
the
dear
old
man
has
got
a
wife
and
children
and
that
he
is
where
are
we
to
find
men
who
have
no
wives
and
children
he
interrupted
look
here
maharani
the
thing
we
call
pity
is
at
bottom
only
pity
for
ourselves
we
can
not
bear
to
wound
our
own
tender
instincts
and
so
we
do
not
strike
at
all
pity
indeed
the
height
of
cowardice
to
hear
sandip
phrases
in
the
mouth
of
this
mere
boy
staggered
me
so
delightfully
lovably
immature
was
he
of
that
age
when
the
good
may
still
be
believed
in
as
good
of
that
age
when
one
really
lives
and
grows
the
mother
in
me
awoke
for
myself
there
was
no
longer
good
or
bad
only
death
beautiful
alluring
death
but
to
hear
this
stripling
calmly
talk
of
murdering
an
inoffensive
old
man
as
the
right
thing
to
do
made
me
shudder
all
over
the
more
clearly
i
saw
that
there
was
no
sin
in
his
heart
the
more
horrible
appeared
to
me
the
sin
of
his
words
i
seemed
to
see
the
sin
of
the
parents
visited
on
the
innocent
child
the
sight
of
his
great
big
eyes
shining
with
faith
and
enthusiasm
touched
me
to
the
quick
he
was
going
in
his
fascination
straight
to
the
jaws
of
the
python
from
which
once
in
there
was
no
return
how
was
he
to
be
saved
why
does
not
my
country
become
for
once
a
real
mother
clasp
him
to
her
bosom
and
cry
out
oh
my
child
my
child
what
profits
it
that
you
should
save
me
if
so
it
be
that
i
should
fail
to
save
you
i
know
i
know
that
all
power
on
earth
waxes
great
under
compact
with
satan
but
the
mother
is
there
alone
though
she
be
to
contemn
and
stand
against
this
devil
progress
the
mother
cares
not
for
mere
success
however
great
she
wants
to
give
life
to
save
life
my
very
soul
today
stretches
out
its
hands
in
yearning
to
save
this
child
a
while
ago
i
suggested
robbery
to
him
whatever
i
may
now
say
against
it
will
be
put
down
to
a
woman
weakness
they
only
love
our
weakness
when
it
drags
the
world
in
its
toils
you
need
do
nothing
at
all
amulya
i
will
see
to
the
money
i
told
him
finally
when
he
had
almost
reached
the
door
i
called
him
back
amulya
said
i
i
am
your
elder
sister
today
is
not
the
brothers
day
according
to
the
calendar
but
all
the
days
in
the
year
are
really
brothers
days
my
blessing
be
with
you
may
god
keep
you
always
these
unexpected
words
from
my
lips
took
amulya
by
surprise
he
stood
for
a
time
then
coming
to
himself
he
prostrated
himself
at
my
feet
in
acceptance
of
the
relationship
and
did
me
reverence
when
he
rose
his
eyes
were
full
of
tears
o
little
brother
mine
i
am
fast
going
to
my
death
let
me
take
all
your
sin
away
with
me
may
no
taint
from
me
ever
tarnish
your
innocence
i
said
to
him
let
your
offering
of
reverence
be
that
pistol
what
do
you
want
with
it
sister
i
will
practise
death
right
sister
our
women
also
must
know
how
to
die
to
deal
death
with
which
amulya
handed
me
the
pistol
the
radiance
of
his
youthful
countenance
seemed
to
tinge
my
life
with
the
touch
of
a
new
dawn
i
put
away
the
pistol
within
my
clothes
may
this
be
the
last
resource
in
my
extremity
the
door
to
the
mother
chamber
in
my
woman
heart
once
opened
i
thought
it
would
always
remain
open
but
this
pathway
to
the
supreme
good
was
closed
when
the
mistress
took
the
place
of
the
mother
and
locked
it
again
the
very
next
day
i
saw
sandip
and
madness
naked
and
rampant
danced
upon
my
heart
what
was
this
was
this
then
my
truer
self
never
i
had
never
before
known
this
shameless
this
cruel
one
within
me
the
had
come
pretending
to
draw
this
snake
from
within
the
fold
of
my
garment
but
it
was
never
there
it
was
his
all
the
time
some
demon
has
gained
possession
of
me
and
what
i
am
doing
today
is
the
play
of
his
activity
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
me
this
demon
in
the
guise
of
a
god
had
come
with
his
ruddy
torch
to
call
me
that
day
saying
i
am
your
country
i
am
your
sandip
i
am
more
to
you
than
anything
else
of
yours
and
with
folded
hands
i
had
responded
you
are
my
religion
you
are
my
heaven
whatever
else
is
mine
shall
be
swept
away
before
my
love
for
you
five
thousand
is
it
five
thousand
it
shall
be
you
want
it
tomorrow
tomorrow
you
shall
have
it
in
this
desperate
orgy
that
gift
of
five
thousand
shall
be
as
the
foam
of
wine
and
then
for
the
riotous
revel
the
immovable
world
shall
sway
under
our
feet
fire
shall
flash
from
our
eyes
a
storm
shall
roar
in
our
ears
what
is
or
is
not
in
front
shall
become
equally
dim
and
then
with
tottering
footsteps
we
shall
plunge
to
our
death
in
a
moment
all
fire
will
be
extinguished
the
ashes
will
be
scattered
and
nothing
will
remain

for
a
time
i
was
utterly
at
a
loss
to
think
of
any
way
of
getting
that
money
then
the
other
day
in
the
light
of
intense
excitement
suddenly
the
whole
picture
stood
out
clear
before
me
every
year
my
husband
makes
a
of
six
thousand
rupees
to
my
at
the
time
of
the
durga
puja
every
year
it
is
deposited
in
her
account
at
the
bank
in
calcutta
this
year
the
offering
was
made
as
usual
but
it
has
not
yet
been
sent
to
the
bank
being
kept
meanwhile
in
an
iron
safe
in
a
corner
of
the
little
attached
to
our
bedroom
every
year
my
husband
takes
the
money
to
the
bank
himself
this
year
he
has
not
yet
had
an
opportunity
of
going
to
town
how
could
i
fail
to
see
the
hand
of
providence
in
this
the
money
has
been
held
up
because
the
country
wants
it
who
could
have
the
power
to
take
it
away
from
her
to
the
bank
and
how
can
i
have
the
power
to
refuse
to
take
the
money
the
goddess
revelling
in
destruction
holds
out
her
crying
give
me
drink
i
am
thirsty
i
will
give
her
my
own

with
that

thousand

the

of
that
money
will
scarcely
feel
the
loss

will

her
with
wheedling
money
out
of
my
trusting
husband
after
her
husband
death
she
often
used
to
make
away
with
things
belonging
to
the
estate
for
her
own
use
this
i
used
to
point
out
to
my
husband
but
he
remained
silent
i
would
get
angry
and
say
if
you
feel
generous
make
gifts
by
all
means
but
why
allow
yourself
to
be
robbed
providence
must
have
smiled
then
at
these
complaints
of
mine
for
tonight
i
am
on
the
way
to
rob
my
husband
safe
of
my
money
my
husband
custom
was
to
let
his
keys
remain
in
his
pockets
when
he
took
off
his
clothes
for
the
night
leaving
them
in
the
i
picked
out
the
key
of
the
safe
and
opened
it
the
slight
sound
it
made
seemed
to
wake
the
whole
world
a
sudden
chill
turned
my
hands
and
feet
icy
cold
and
i
shivered
all
over
there
was
a
drawer
inside
the
safe
on
opening
this
i
found
the
money
not
in
currency
notes
but
in
gold
rolled
up
in
paper
i
had
no
time
to
count
out
what
i
wanted
there
were
twenty
rolls
all
of
which
i
took
and
tied
up
in
a
corner
of
my
what
a
weight
it
was
the
burden
of
the
theft
crushed
my
heart
to
the
dust
perhaps
notes
would
have
made
it
seem
less
like
thieving
but
this
was
all
gold
after
i
had
stolen
into
my
room
like
a
thief
it
felt
like
my
own
room
no
longer
all
the
most
precious
rights
which
i
had
over
it
vanished
at
the
touch
of
my
theft
i
began
to
mutter
to
myself
as
though
telling
bande
mataram
bande
my
country
my
golden
country
all
this
gold
is
for
you
for
none
else
but
in
the
night
the
mind
is
weak
i
came
back
into
the
bedroom
where
my
husband
was
asleep
closing
my
eyes
as
i
passed
through
and
went
off
to
the
open
terrace
beyond
on
which
i
lay
prone
clasping
to
my
breast
the
end
of
the
tied
over
the
gold
and
each
one
of
the
rolls
gave
me
a
shock
of
pain
the
silent
night
stood
there
with
forefinger
upraised
i
could
not
think
of
my
house
as
separate
from
my
country
i
had
robbed
my
house
i
had
robbed
my
country
for
this
sin
my
house
had
ceased
to
be
mine
my
country
also
was
estranged
from
me
had
i
died
begging
for
my
country
even
unsuccessfully
that
would
have
been
worship
acceptable
to
the
gods
but
theft
is
never
worship
how
then
can
i
offer
this
gold
ah
me
i
am
doomed
to
death
myself
must
i
desecrate
my
country
with
my
impious
touch
the
way
to
put
the
money
back
is
closed
to
me
i
have
not
the
strength
to
return
to
the
room
take
again
that
key
open
once
more
that
safe
i
should
swoon
on
the
threshold
of
my
husband
door
the
only
road
left
now
is
the
road
in
front
neither
have
i
the
strength
deliberately
to
sit
down
and
count
the
coins
let
them
remain
behind
their
coverings
i
can
not
calculate
there
was
no
mist
in
the
winter
sky
the
stars
were
shining
brightly
if
thought
i
to
myself
as
i
lay
out
there
i
had
to
steal
these
stars
one
by
one
like
golden
coins
for
my
country
these
stars
so
carefully
stored
up
in
the
bosom
of
the
darkness
then
the
sky
would
be
blinded
the
night
widowed
for
ever
and
my
theft
would
rob
the
whole
world
but
was
not
also
this
very
thing
i
had
done
a
robbing
of
the
whole
world
not
only
of
money
but
of
trust
of
righteousness
i
spent
the
night
lying
on
the
terrace
when
at
last
it
was
morning
and
i
was
sure
that
my
husband
had
risen
and
left
the
room
then
only
with
my
shawl
pulled
over
my
head
could
i
retrace
my
steps
towards
the
bedroom
my
was
about
with
her
brass
pot
watering
her
plants
when
she
saw
me
passing
in
the
distance
she
cried
have
you
heard
the
news
chota
rani
i
stopped
in
silence
all
in
a
tremor
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
rolls
of
sovereigns
were
bulging
through
the
shawl
i
feared
they
would
burst
and
scatter
in
a
ringing
shower
exposing
to
all
the
servants
of
the
house
the
thief
who
had
made
herself
destitute
by
robbing
her
own
wealth
your
band
of
robbers
she
went
on
have
sent
an
anonymous
message
threatening
to
loot
the
treasury
i
remained
as
silent
as
a
thief
i
was
advising
brother
nikhil
to
seek
your
protection
she
continued
banteringly
call
off
your
minions
robber
queen
we
will
offer
sacrifices
to
your
if
you
will
but
save
us
what
doings
there
are
these
days
but
for
the
lord
sake
spare
our
house
at
least
from
burglary
i
hastened
into
my
room
without
reply
i
had
put
my
foot
on
quicksand
and
could
not
now
withdraw
it
struggling
would
only
send
me
down
deeper
if
only
the
time
would
arrive
when
i
could
hand
over
the
money
to
sandip
i
could
bear
it
no
longer
its
weight
was
breaking
through
my
very
ribs
it
was
still
early
when
i
got
word
that
sandip
was
awaiting
me
today
i
had
no
thought
of
adornment
wrapped
as
i
was
in
my
shawl
i
went
off
to
the
outer
apartments
as
i
entered
the
i
saw
sandip
and
amulya
there
together
all
my
dignity
all
my
honour
seemed
to
run
tingling
through
my
body
from
head
to
foot
and
vanish
into
the
ground
i
should
have
to
lay
bare
a
woman
uttermost
shame
in
sight
of
this
boy
could
they
have
been
discussing
my
deed
in
their
meeting
place
had
any
vestige
of
a
veil
of
decency
been
left
for
me
we
women
shall
never
understand
men
when
they
are
bent
on
making
a
road
for
some
achievement
they
think
nothing
of
breaking
the
heart
of
the
world
into
pieces
to
pave
it
for
the
progress
of
their
chariot
when
they
are
mad
with
the
intoxication
of
creating
they
rejoice
in
destroying
the
creation
of
the
creator
this
shame
of
mine
will
not
attract
even
a
glance
from
their
eyes
they
have
no
feeling
for
life
itself
all
their
eagerness
is
for
their
object
what
am
i
to
them
but
a
meadow
flower
in
the
path
of
a
torrent
in
flood
what
good
will
this
extinction
of
me
be
to
sandip
only
five
thousand
rupees
was
not
i
good
for
something
more
than
only
five
thousand
rupees
yes
indeed
did
i
not
learn
that
from
sandip
himself
and
was
i
not
able
in
the
light
of
this
knowledge
to
despise
all
else
in
my
world
i
was
the
giver
of
light
of
life
of
of
immortality
in
that
belief
in
that
joy
i
had
burst
all
my
bounds
and
come
into
the
open
had
anyone
then
fulfilled
for
me
that
joy
i
should
have
lived
in
my
death
i
should
have
lost
nothing
in
the
loss
of
my
all
do
they
want
to
tell
me
now
that
all
this
was
false
the
psalm
of
my
praise
which
was
sung
so
devotedly
did
it
bring
me
down
from
my
heaven
not
to
make
heaven
of
earth
but
only
to
level
heaven
itself
with
the
dust
xvi
the
money
queen
said
sandip
with
his
keen
glance
full
on
my
face
amulya
also
fixed
his
gaze
on
me
though
not
my
own
child
yet
the
dear
lad
is
brother
to
me
for
mother
is
mother
all
the
world
over
with
his
guileless
face
his
gentle
eyes
his
innocent
youth
he
looked
at
me
and
i
a
woman
of
his
mother
sex
how
could
i
hand
him
poison
just
because
he
asked
for
it
the
money
queen
sandip
insolent
demand
rang
in
my
ears
for
very
shame
and
vexation
i
felt
i
wanted
to
fling
that
gold
at
sandip
head
i
could
hardly
undo
the
knot
of
my
my
fingers
trembled
so
at
last
the
paper
rolls
dropped
on
the
table
sandip
face
grew
black
he
must
have
thought
that
the
rolls
were
of
silver
what
contempt
was
in
his
looks
what
utter
disgust
at
incapacity
it
was
almost
as
if
he
could
have
struck
me
he
must
have
suspected
that
i
had
come
to
parley
with
him
to
offer
to
compound
his
claim
for
five
thousand
rupees
with
a
few
hundreds
there
was
a
moment
when
i
thought
he
would
snatch
up
the
rolls
and
throw
them
out
of
the
window
declaring
that
he
was
no
beggar
but
a
king
claiming
tribute
is
that
all
asked
amulya
with
such
pity
welling
up
in
his
voice
that
i
wanted
to
sob
out
aloud
i
kept
my
heart
tightly
pressed
down
and
merely
nodded
my
head
sandip
was
speechless
he
neither
touched
the
rolls
nor
uttered
a
sound
my
humiliation
went
straight
to
the
boy
heart
with
a
sudden
feigned
enthusiasm
he
exclaimed
it
plenty
it
will
do
splendidly
you
have
saved
us
with
which
he
tore
open
the
covering
of
one
of
the
rolls
the
sovereigns
shone
out
and
in
a
moment
the
black
covering
seemed
to
be
lifted
from
sandip
countenance
also
his
delight
beamed
forth
from
his
features
unable
to
control
his
sudden
revulsion
of
feeling
he
sprang
up
from
his
seat
towards
me
what
he
intended
i
know
not
i
flashed
a
lightning
glance
towards
amulya
the
colour
had
left
the
boy
face
as
at
the
stroke
of
a
whip
then
with
all
my
strength
i
thrust
sandip
from
me
as
he
reeled
back
his
head
struck
the
edge
of
the
marble
table
and
he
dropped
on
the
floor
there
he
lay
awhile
motionless
exhausted
with
my
effort
i
sank
back
on
my
seat
amulya
face
lightened
with
a
joyful
radiance
he
did
not
even
turn
towards
sandip
but
came
straight
up
took
the
dust
of
my
feet
and
then
remained
there
sitting
on
the
floor
in
front
of
me
o
my
little
brother
my
child
this
reverence
of
yours
is
the
last
touch
of
heaven
left
in
my
empty
world
i
could
contain
myself
no
longer
and
my
tears
flowed
fast
i
covered
my
eyes
with
the
end
of
my
which
i
pressed
to
my
face
with
both
my
hands
and
sobbed
and
sobbed
and
every
time
that
i
felt
on
my
feet
his
tender
touch
trying
to
comfort
me
my
tears
broke
out
afresh
after
a
little
when
i
had
recovered
myself
and
taken
my
hands
from
my
face
i
saw
sandip
back
at
the
table
gathering
up
the
sovereigns
in
his
handkerchief
as
if
nothing
had
happened
amulya
rose
to
his
seat
from
his
place
near
my
feet
his
wet
eyes
shining
sandip
coolly
looked
up
at
my
face
as
he
remarked
it
is
six
thousand
what
do
we
want
with
so
much
sandip
babu
cried
amulya
three
thousand
five
hundred
is
all
we
need
for
our
work
our
wants
are
not
for
this
one
place
only
sandip
replied
we
shall
want
all
we
can
get
that
may
be
said
amulya
but
in
future
i
undertake
to
get
you
all
you
want
out
of
this
sandip
babu
please
return
the
extra
two
thousand
five
hundred
to
the
maharani
sandip
glanced
enquiringly
at
me
no
no
i
exclaimed
i
shall
never
touch
that
money
again
do
with
it
as
you
will
can
man
ever
give
as
woman
can
said
sandip
looking
towards
amulya
they
are
goddesses
agreed
amulya
with
enthusiasm
we
men
can
at
best
give
of
our
power
continued
sandip
but
women
give
themselves
out
of
their
own
life
they
give
birth
out
of
their
own
life
they
give
sustenance
such
gifts
are
the
only
true
gifts
then
turning
to
me
queen
said
he
if
what
you
have
given
us
had
been
only
money
i
would
not
have
touched
it
but
you
have
given
that
which
is
more
to
you
than
life
itself
there
must
be
two
different
persons
inside
men
one
of
these
in
me
can
understand
that
sandip
is
trying
to
delude
me
the
other
is
content
to
be
deluded
sandip
has
power
but
no
strength
of
righteousness
the
weapon
of
his
which
rouses
up
life
smites
it
again
to
death
he
has
the
unfailing
quiver
of
the
gods
but
the
shafts
in
them
are
of
the
demons
sandip
handkerchief
was
not
large
enough
to
hold
all
the
coins
queen
he
asked
can
you
give
me
another
when
i
gave
him
mine
he
reverently
touched
his
forehead
with
it
and
then
suddenly
kneeling
on
the
floor
he
made
me
an
obeisance
goddess
he
said
it
was
to
offer
my
reverence
that
i
had
approached
you
but
you
repulsed
me
and
rolled
me
in
the
dust
be
it
so
i
accept
your
repulse
as
your
boon
to
me
i
raise
it
to
my
head
in
salutation
with
which
he
pointed
to
the
place
where
he
had
been
hurt
had
i
then
misunderstood
him
could
it
be
that
his
outstretched
hands
had
really
been
directed
towards
my
feet
yet
surely
even
amulya
had
seen
the
passion
that
flamed
out
of
his
eyes
his
face
but
sandip
is
such
an
adept
in
setting
music
to
his
chant
of
praise
that
i
can
not
argue
i
lose
my
power
of
seeing
truth
my
sight
is
clouded
over
like
an
eyes
and
so
after
all
he
gave
me
back
twice
as
much
in
return
for
the
blow
i
had
dealt
him
the
wound
on
his
head
ended
by
making
me
bleed
at
heart
when
i
had
received
sandip
obeisance
my
theft
seemed
to
gain
a
dignity
and
the
gold
glittering
on
the
table
to
smile
away
all
fear
of
disgrace
all
stings
of
conscience
like
me
amulya
also
was
won
back
his
devotion
to
sandip
which
had
suffered
a
momentary
check
blazed
up
anew
the
of
his
mind
filled
once
more
with
offerings
for
the
worship
of
sandip
and
me
his
simple
faith
shone
out
of
his
eyes
with
the
pure
light
of
the
morning
star
at
dawn
after
i
had
offered
worship
and
received
worship
my
sin
became
radiant
and
as
amulya
looked
on
my
face
he
raised
his
folded
hands
in
salutation
and
cried
i
can
not
expect
to
have
this
adoration
surrounding
me
for
ever
and
yet
this
has
come
to
be
the
only
means
of
keeping
alive
my
respect
i
can
no
longer
enter
my
bedroom
the
bedstead
seems
to
thrust
out
a
forbidding
hand
the
iron
safe
frowns
at
me
i
want
to
get
away
from
this
continual
insult
to
myself
which
is
rankling
within
me
i
want
to
keep
running
to
sandip
to
hear
him
sing
my
praises
there
is
just
this
one
little
altar
of
worship
which
has
kept
its
head
above
the
depths
of
my
dishonour
and
so
i
want
to
cleave
to
it
night
and
day
for
on
whichever
side
i
step
away
from
it
there
is
only
emptiness
praise
praise
i
want
unceasing
praise
i
can
not
live
if
my
be
left
empty
for
a
single
moment
so
as
the
very
price
of
my
life
i
want
sandip
of
all
the
world
today
xvii
when
my
husband
nowadays
comes
in
for
his
meals
i
feel
i
can
not
sit
before
him
and
yet
it
is
such
a
shame
not
to
be
near
him
that
i
feel
i
can
not
do
that
either
so
i
seat
myself
where
we
can
not
look
at
each
other
face
that
was
how
i
was
sitting
the
other
day
when
the
bara
rani
came
and
joined
us
it
is
all
very
well
for
you
brother
said
she
to
laugh
away
these
threatening
letters
but
they
do
frighten
me
so
have
you
sent
off
that
money
you
gave
me
to
the
calcutta
bank
no
i
have
not
yet
had
the
time
to
get
it
away
my
husband
replied
you
are
so
careless
brother
dear
you
had
better
look
out
but
it
is
in
the
iron
safe
right
inside
the
inner
room
said
my
husband
with
a
reassuring
smile
what
if
they
get
in
there
you
can
never
tell
if
they
go
so
far
they
might
as
well
carry
you
off
too
do
you
fear
no
one
will
come
for
poor
me
the
real
attraction
is
in
your
room
but
joking
apart
do
run
the
risk
of
keeping
money
in
the
room
like
that
they
will
be
taking
along
the
government
revenue
to
calcutta
in
a
few
days
now
i
will
send
this
money
to
the
bank
under
the
same
escort
very
well
but
see
you
do
forget
all
about
it
you
are
so
even
if
that
money
gets
lost
while
in
my
room
the
loss
can
not
be
yours
sister
rani
now
now
brother
you
will
make
me
very
angry
if
you
talk
in
that
way
was
i
making
any
difference
between
yours
and
mine
what
if
your
money
is
lost
does
not
that
hurt
me
if
providence
has
thought
fit
to
take
away
my
all
it
has
not
left
me
insensible
to
the
value
of
the
most
devoted
brother
known
since
the
days
of
lakshman
well
junior
rani
are
you
turned
into
a
wooden
doll
you
have
not
spoken
a
word
yet
do
you
know
brother
our
junior
rani
thinks
i
try
to
flatter
you
if
things
came
to
that
pass
i
should
not
hesitate
to
do
so
but
i
know
my
dear
old
brother
does
not
need
it
thus
the
senior
rani
chattered
on
not
forgetting
now
and
then
to
draw
her
brother
attention
to
this
or
that
special
delicacy
amongst
the
dishes
that
were
being
served
my
head
was
all
the
time
in
a
whirl
the
crisis
was
fast
coming
something
must
be
done
about
replacing
that
money
and
as
i
kept
asking
myself
what
could
be
done
and
how
it
was
to
be
done
the
unceasing
patter
of
my
words
seemed
more
and
more
intolerable
what
made
it
all
the
worse
was
that
nothing
could
escape
my
keen
eyes
every
now
and
then
she
was
casting
side
glances
towards
me
what
she
could
read
in
my
face
i
do
not
know
but
to
me
it
seemed
that
everything
was
written
there
only
too
plainly
then
i
did
an
infinitely
rash
thing
affecting
an
easy
amused
laugh
i
said
all
the
senior
rani
suspicions
i
see
are
reserved
for
me
her
fears
of
thieves
and
robbers
are
only
a
feint
the
senior
rani
smiled
mischievously
you
are
right
sister
mine
a
woman
theft
is
the
most
fatal
of
all
thefts
but
how
can
you
elude
my
watchfulness
am
i
a
man
that
you
should
hoodwink
me
if
you
fear
me
so
i
retorted
let
me
keep
in
your
hands
all
i
have
as
security
if
i
cause
you
loss
you
can
then
repay
yourself
just
listen
to
her
our
simple
little
junior
rani
she
laughed
back
turning
to
my
husband
does
she
not
know
that
there
are
losses
which
no
security
can
make
good
either
in
this
world
or
in
the
next
my
husband
did
not
join
in
our
exchange
of
words
when
he
had
finished
he
went
off
to
the
outer
apartments
for
nowadays
he
does
not
take
his
rest
in
our
room
all
my
more
valuable
jewels
were
in
deposit
in
the
treasury
in
charge
of
the
cashier
still
what
i
kept
with
me
must
have
been
worth
thirty
or
forty
thousand
i
took
my
to
the
bara
rani
room
and
opened
it
out
before
her
saying
i
leave
these
with
you
sister
they
will
keep
you
quite
safe
from
all
worry
the
bara
rani
made
a
gesture
of
mock
despair
you
positively
astound
me
chota
rani
she
said
do
you
really
suppose
i
spend
sleepless
nights
for
fear
of
being
robbed
by
you
what
harm
if
you
did
have
a
wholesome
fear
of
me
does
anybody
know
anybody
else
in
this
world
you
want
to
teach
me
a
lesson
by
trusting
me
no
no
i
am
bothered
enough
to
know
what
to
do
with
my
own
jewels
without
keeping
watch
over
yours
take
them
away
there
a
dear
so
many
prying
servants
are
about
i
went
straight
from
my
room
to
the
outside
and
sent
for
amulya
with
him
sandip
came
along
too
i
was
in
a
great
hurry
and
said
to
sandip
if
you
do
mind
i
want
to
have
a
word
or
two
with
amulya
would
you
sandip
smiled
a
wry
smile
so
amulya
and
i
are
separate
in
your
eyes
if
you
have
set
about
to
wean
him
from
me
i
must
confess
i
have
no
power
to
retain
him
i
made
no
reply
but
stood
waiting
be
it
so
sandip
went
on
finish
your
special
talk
with
amulya
but
then
you
must
give
me
a
special
talk
all
to
myself
too
or
it
will
mean
a
defeat
for
me
i
can
stand
everything
but
not
defeat
my
share
must
always
be
the
lion
share
this
has
been
my
constant
quarrel
with
providence
i
will
defeat
the
dispenser
of
my
fate
but
not
take
defeat
at
his
hands
with
a
crushing
look
at
amulya
sandip
walked
out
of
the
room
amulya
my
own
little
brother
you
must
do
one
thing
for
me
i
said
i
will
stake
my
life
for
whatever
duty
you
may
lay
on
me
sister
i
brought
out
my
from
the
folds
of
my
shawl
and
placed
it
before
him
sell
or
pawn
these
i
said
and
get
me
six
thousand
rupees
as
fast
as
ever
you
can
no
no
sister
rani
said
amulya
touched
to
the
quick
let
these
jewels
be
i
will
get
you
six
thousand
all
the
same
oh
do
be
silly
i
said
impatiently
there
is
no
time
for
any
nonsense
take
this
box
get
away
to
calcutta
by
the
night
train
and
bring
me
the
money
by
the
day
after
tomorrow
positively
amulya
took
a
diamond
necklace
out
of
the
box
held
it
up
to
the
light
and
put
it
back
gloomily
i
know
i
told
him
that
you
will
never
get
the
proper
price
for
these
diamonds
so
i
am
giving
you
jewels
worth
about
thirty
thousand
i
do
care
if
they
all
go
but
i
must
have
that
six
thousand
without
fail
do
you
know
sister
rani
said
amulya
i
have
had
a
quarrel
with
sandip
babu
over
that
six
thousand
rupees
he
took
from
you
i
can
not
tell
you
how
ashamed
i
felt
but
sandip
babu
would
have
it
that
we
must
give
up
even
our
shame
for
the
country
that
may
be
so
but
this
is
somehow
different
i
do
not
fear
to
die
for
the
country
to
kill
for
the
country
that
much
has
been
given
me
but
i
can
not
forget
the
shame
of
having
taken
money
from
you
there
sandip
babu
is
ahead
of
me
he
has
no
regrets
or
compunctions
he
says
we
must
get
rid
of
the
idea
that
the
money
belongs
to
the
one
in
whose
box
it
happens
to
be
if
we
can
not
where
is
the
magic
of
amulya
gathered
enthusiasm
as
he
talked
on
he
always
warms
up
when
he
has
me
for
a
listener
the
gita
tells
us
he
continued
that
no
one
can
kill
the
soul
killing
is
a
mere
word
so
also
is
the
taking
away
of
money
whose
is
the
money
no
one
has
created
it
no
one
can
take
it
away
with
him
when
he
departs
this
life
for
it
is
no
part
of
his
soul
today
it
is
mine
tomorrow
my
son
the
next
day
his
creditor
since
in
fact
money
belongs
to
no
one
why
should
any
blame
attach
to
our
patriots
if
instead
of
leaving
it
for
some
worthless
son
they
take
it
for
their
own
use
when
i
hear
sandip
words
uttered
by
this
boy
i
tremble
all
over
let
those
who
are
play
with
snakes
if
harm
comes
to
them
they
are
prepared
for
it
but
these
boys
are
so
innocent
all
the
world
is
ready
with
its
blessing
to
protect
them
they
play
with
a
snake
not
knowing
its
nature
and
when
we
see
them
smilingly
trustfully
putting
their
hands
within
reach
of
its
fangs
then
we
understand
how
terribly
dangerous
the
snake
is
sandip
is
right
when
he
suspects
that
though
i
for
myself
may
be
ready
to
die
at
his
hands
this
boy
i
shall
wean
from
him
and
save
so
the
money
is
wanted
for
the
use
of
your
patriots
i
questioned
with
a
smile
of
course
it
is
said
amulya
proudly
are
they
not
our
kings
poverty
takes
away
from
their
regal
power
do
you
know
we
always
insist
on
sandip
babu
travelling
first
class
he
never
shirks
kingly
honours
he
accepts
them
not
for
himself
but
for
the
glory
of
us
all
the
greatest
weapon
of
those
who
rule
the
world
sandip
babu
has
told
us
is
the
hypnotism
of
their
display
to
take
the
vow
of
poverty
would
be
for
them
not
merely
a
penance
it
would
mean
suicide
at
this
point
sandip
noiselessly
entered
the
room
i
threw
my
shawl
over
the
with
a
rapid
movement
the
business
not
yet
over
he
asked
with
a
sneer
in
his
tone
yes
we
quite
finished
said
amulya
apologetically
it
was
nothing
much
no
amulya
i
said
we
have
not
quite
finished
so
exit
sandip
for
the
second
time
i
suppose
said
sandip
if
you
please
and
as
to
sandip
not
today
i
have
no
time
i
see
said
sandip
as
his
eyes
flashed
no
time
to
waste
only
for
special
talks
jealousy
where
the
strong
man
shows
weakness
there
the
weaker
sex
can
not
help
beating
her
drums
of
victory
so
i
repeated
firmly
i
really
have
no
time
sandip
went
away
looking
black
amulya
was
greatly
perturbed
sister
rani
he
pleaded
sandip
babu
is
annoyed
he
has
neither
cause
nor
right
to
be
annoyed
i
said
with
some
vehemence
let
me
caution
you
about
one
thing
amulya
say
nothing
to
sandip
babu
about
the
sale
of
my
jewels
on
your
life
no
i
will
not
then
you
had
better
not
delay
any
more
you
must
get
away
by
tonight
train
amulya
and
i
left
the
room
together
as
we
came
out
on
the
verandah
sandip
was
standing
there
i
could
see
he
was
waiting
to
waylay
amulya
to
prevent
that
i
had
to
engage
him
what
is
it
you
wanted
to
tell
me
sandip
babu
i
asked
i
have
nothing
special
to
say
mere
small
talk
and
since
you
have
not
the
time
i
can
give
you
just
a
little
by
this
time
amulya
had
left
as
we
entered
the
room
sandip
asked
what
was
that
box
amulya
carried
away
the
box
had
not
escaped
his
eyes
i
remained
firm
if
i
could
have
told
you
it
would
have
been
made
over
to
him
in
your
presence
so
you
think
amulya
will
not
tell
me
no
he
will
not
sandip
could
not
conceal
his
anger
any
longer
you
think
you
will
gain
the
mastery
over
me
he
blazed
out
that
shall
never
be
amulya
there
would
die
a
happy
death
if
i
deigned
to
trample
him
under
foot
i
will
never
so
long
as
i
live
allow
you
to
bring
him
to
your
feet
oh
the
weak
the
weak
at
last
sandip
has
realized
that
he
is
weak
before
me
that
is
why
there
is
this
sudden
outburst
of
anger
he
has
understood
that
he
can
not
meet
the
power
that
i
wield
with
mere
strength
with
a
glance
i
can
crumble
his
strongest
fortifications
so
he
must
needs
resort
to
bluster
i
simply
smiled
in
contemptuous
silence
at
last
have
i
come
to
a
level
above
him
i
must
never
lose
this
vantage
ground
never
descend
lower
again
amidst
all
my
degradation
this
bit
of
dignity
must
remain
to
me
i
know
said
sandip
after
a
pause
it
was
your
you
may
guess
as
you
please
said
i
but
you
will
get
nothing
out
of
me
so
you
trust
amulya
more
than
you
trust
me
do
you
know
that
the
boy
is
the
shadow
of
my
shadow
the
echo
of
my
echo
that
he
is
nothing
if
i
am
not
at
his
side
where
he
is
not
your
echo
he
is
himself
amulya
and
that
is
where
i
trust
him
more
than
i
can
trust
your
echo
you
must
not
forget
that
you
are
under
a
promise
to
render
up
all
your
ornaments
to
me
for
the
worship
of
the
divine
mother
in
fact
your
offering
has
already
been
made
whatever
ornaments
the
gods
leave
to
me
will
be
offered
up
to
the
gods
but
how
can
i
offer
those
which
have
been
stolen
away
from
me
look
here
it
is
no
use
your
trying
to
give
me
the
slip
in
that
fashion
now
is
the
time
for
grim
work
let
that
work
be
finished
then
you
can
make
a
display
of
your
woman
wiles
to
your
heart
content
and
i
will
help
you
in
your
game
the
moment
i
had
stolen
my
husband
money
and
paid
it
to
sandip
the
music
that
was
in
our
relations
stopped
not
only
did
i
destroy
all
my
own
value
by
making
myself
cheap
but
powers
too
lost
scope
for
their
full
play
you
can
not
employ
your
marksmanship
against
a
thing
which
is
right
in
your
grasp
so
sandip
has
lost
his
aspect
of
the
hero
a
tone
of
low
quarrelsomeness
has
come
into
his
words
sandip
kept
his
brilliant
eyes
fixed
full
on
my
face
till
they
seemed
to
blaze
with
all
the
thirst
of
the
sky
once
or
twice
he
fidgeted
with
his
feet
as
though
to
leave
his
seat
as
if
to
spring
right
on
me
my
whole
body
seemed
to
swim
my
veins
throbbed
the
hot
blood
surged
up
to
my
ears
i
felt
that
if
i
remained
there
i
should
never
get
up
at
all
with
a
supreme
effort
i
tore
myself
off
the
chair
and
hastened
towards
the
door
from
sandip
dry
throat
there
came
a
muffled
cry
whither
would
you
flee
queen
the
next
moment
he
left
his
seat
with
a
bound
to
seize
hold
of
me
at
the
sound
of
footsteps
outside
the
door
however
he
rapidly
retreated
and
fell
back
into
his
chair
i
checked
my
steps
near
the
bookshelf
where
i
stood
staring
at
the
names
of
the
books
as
my
husband
entered
the
room
sandip
exclaimed
i
say
nikhil
do
you
keep
browning
among
your
books
here
i
was
just
telling
queen
bee
of
our
college
club
do
you
remember
that
contest
of
ours
over
the
translation
of
those
lines
from
browning
you
do
she
should
never
have
looked
at
me
if
she
meant
i
should
not
love
her
there
are
plenty
men
you
call
such
i
suppose
she
may
discover
all
her
soul
to
if
she
pleases
and
yet
leave
much
as
she
found
them
but
i
not
so
and
she
knew
it
when
she
fixed
me
glancing
round
them
i
managed
to
get
together
the
words
to
render
it
into
bengali
somehow
but
the
result
was
hardly
likely
to
be
a
to
the
people
of
bengal
i
really
did
think
at
one
time
that
i
was
on
the
verge
of
becoming
a
poet
but
providence
was
kind
enough
to
save
me
from
that
disaster
do
you
remember
old
dakshina
if
he
had
not
become
a
salt
inspector
he
would
have
been
a
poet
i
remember
his
rendering
to
this
day
no
queen
bee
it
is
no
use
rummaging
those
bookshelves
nikhil
has
ceased
to
read
poetry
since
his
marriage
perhaps
he
has
no
further
need
for
it
but
i
suppose
fever
fit
of
poesy
as
the
sanskrit
has
it
is
about
to
attack
me
again
i
have
come
to
give
you
a
warning
sandip
said
my
husband
about
the
fever
fit
of
poesy
my
husband
took
no
notice
of
this
attempt
at
humour
for
some
time
he
continued
mahomedan
preachers
have
been
about
stirring
up
the
local
mussulmans
they
are
all
wild
with
you
and
may
attack
you
any
moment
are
you
come
to
advise
flight
i
have
come
to
give
you
information
not
to
offer
advice
had
these
estates
been
mine
such
a
warning
would
have
been
necessary
for
the
preachers
not
for
me
if
instead
of
trying
to
frighten
me
you
give
them
a
taste
of
your
intimidation
that
would
be
worthier
both
of
you
and
me
do
you
know
that
your
weakness
is
weakening
your
neighbouring
also
i
did
not
offer
you
my
advice
sandip
i
wish
you
too
would
refrain
from
giving
me
yours
besides
it
is
useless
and
there
is
another
thing
i
want
to
tell
you
you
and
your
followers
have
been
secretly
worrying
and
oppressing
my
tenantry
i
can
not
allow
that
any
longer
so
i
must
ask
you
to
leave
my
territory
for
fear
of
the
mussulmans
or
is
there
any
other
fear
you
have
to
threaten
me
with
there
are
fears
the
want
of
which
is
cowardice
in
the
name
of
those
fears
i
tell
you
sandip
you
must
go
in
five
days
i
shall
be
starting
for
calcutta
i
want
you
to
accompany
me
you
may
of
course
stay
in
my
house
there
to
that
there
is
no
objection
all
right
i
have
still
five
day
time
then
meanwhile
queen
bee
let
me
hum
to
you
my
song
of
parting
from
your
ah
you
poet
of
modern
bengal
throw
open
your
doors
and
let
me
plunder
your
words
the
theft
is
really
yours
for
it
is
my
song
which
you
have
made
your
own
let
the
name
be
yours
by
all
means
but
the
song
is
mine
with
this
sandip
struck
up
in
a
deep
husky
voice
which
threatened
to
be
out
of
tune
a
song
in
the
bhairavi
mode
in
the
springtime
of
your
kingdom
my
queen
meetings
and
partings
chase
each
other
in
their
endless
hide
and
seek
and
flowers
blossom
in
the
wake
of
those
that
droop
and
die
in
the
shade
in
the
springtime
of
your
kingdom
my
queen
my
meeting
with
you
had
its
own
songs
but
has
not
also
my
any
gift
to
offer
you
that
gift
is
my
secret
hope
which
i
keep
hidden
in
the
shadows
of
your
flower
garden
that
the
rains
of
july
may
sweetly
temper
your
fiery
june
his
boldness
was
immense
boldness
which
had
no
veil
but
was
naked
as
fire
one
finds
no
time
to
stop
it
it
is
like
trying
to
resist
a
thunderbolt
the
lightning
flashes
it
laughs
at
all
resistance
i
left
the
room
as
i
was
passing
along
the
verandah
towards
the
inner
apartments
amulya
suddenly
made
his
appearance
and
came
and
stood
before
me
fear
nothing
sister
rani
he
said
i
am
off
tonight
and
shall
not
return
unsuccessful
amulya
said
i
looking
straight
into
his
earnest
youthful
face
i
fear
nothing
for
myself
but
may
i
never
cease
to
fear
for
you
amulya
turned
to
go
but
before
he
was
out
of
sight
i
called
him
back
and
asked
have
you
a
mother
amulya
i
have
a
sister
no
i
am
the
only
child
of
my
mother
my
father
died
when
i
was
quite
little
then
go
back
to
your
mother
amulya
but
sister
rani
i
have
now
both
mother
and
sister
then
amulya
before
you
leave
tonight
come
and
have
your
dinner
here
there
wo
be
time
for
that
let
me
take
some
food
for
the
journey
consecrated
with
your
touch
what
do
you
specially
like
amulya
if
i
had
been
with
my
mother
i
should
have
had
lots
of
poush
cakes
make
some
for
me
with
your
own
hands
sister
rani
of
the
the
story
of
his
devotion
to
his
elder
brother
rama
and
his
brother
wife
sita
has
become
a
byword
chapter
ten
nikhil
story
xii
i
learnt
from
my
master
that
sandip
had
joined
forces
with
harish
kundu
and
there
was
to
be
a
grand
celebration
of
the
worship
of
the
goddess
harish
kundu
was
extorting
the
expenses
from
his
tenantry
pandits
kaviratna
and
vidyavagish
had
been
commissioned
to
compose
a
hymn
with
a
double
meaning
my
master
has
just
had
a
passage
at
arms
with
sandip
over
this
evolution
is
at
work
amongst
the
gods
as
well
says
sandip
the
grandson
has
to
remodel
the
gods
created
by
the
grandfather
to
suit
his
own
taste
or
else
he
is
left
an
atheist
it
is
my
mission
to
modernize
the
ancient
deities
i
am
born
the
saviour
of
the
gods
to
emancipate
them
from
the
thraldom
of
the
past
i
have
seen
from
our
boyhood
what
a
juggler
with
ideas
is
sandip
he
has
no
interest
in
discovering
truth
but
to
make
a
quizzical
display
of
it
rejoices
his
heart
had
he
been
born
in
the
wilds
of
africa
he
would
have
spent
a
glorious
time
inventing
argument
after
argument
to
prove
that
cannibalism
is
the
best
means
of
promoting
true
communion
between
man
and
man
but
those
who
deal
in
delusion
end
by
deluding
themselves
and
i
fully
believe
that
each
time
sandip
creates
a
new
fallacy
he
persuades
himself
that
he
has
found
the
truth
however
contradictory
his
creations
may
be
to
one
another
however
i
shall
not
give
a
helping
hand
to
establish
a
liquor
distillery
in
my
country
the
young
men
who
are
ready
to
offer
their
services
for
their
country
cause
must
not
fall
into
this
habit
of
getting
intoxicated
the
people
who
want
to
exact
work
by
drugging
methods
set
more
value
on
the
excitement
than
on
the
minds
they
intoxicate
i
had
to
tell
sandip
in
bimala
presence
that
he
must
go
perhaps
both
will
impute
to
me
the
wrong
motive
but
i
must
free
myself
also
from
all
fear
of
being
misunderstood
let
even
bimala
misunderstand
me
a
number
of
mahomedan
preachers
are
being
sent
over
from
dacca
the
mussulmans
in
my
territory
had
come
to
have
almost
as
much
of
an
aversion
to
the
killing
of
cows
as
the
hindus
but
now
cases
of
are
cropping
up
here
and
there
i
had
the
news
first
from
some
of
my
mussulman
tenants
with
expressions
of
their
disapproval
here
was
a
situation
which
i
could
see
would
be
difficult
to
meet
at
the
bottom
was
a
pretence
of
fanaticism
which
would
cease
to
be
a
pretence
if
obstructed
that
is
just
where
the
ingenuity
of
the
move
came
in
i
sent
for
some
of
my
principal
hindu
tenants
and
tried
to
get
them
to
see
the
matter
in
its
proper
light
we
can
be
staunch
in
our
own
convictions
i
said
but
we
have
no
control
over
those
of
others
for
all
that
many
of
us
are
vaishnavas
those
of
us
who
are
shaktas
go
on
with
their
animal
sacrifices
just
the
same
that
can
not
be
helped
we
must
in
the
same
way
let
the
mussulmans
do
as
they
think
best
so
please
refrain
from
all
disturbance
maharaja
they
replied
these
outrages
have
been
unknown
for
so
long
that
was
so
i
said
because
such
was
their
spontaneous
desire
let
us
behave
in
such
a
way
that
the
same
may
become
true
over
again
but
a
breach
of
the
peace
is
not
the
way
to
bring
this
about
no
maharaja
they
insisted
those
good
old
days
are
gone
this
will
never
stop
unless
you
put
it
down
with
a
strong
hand
oppression
i
replied
will
not
only
not
prevent
it
may
lead
to
the
killing
of
men
as
well
one
of
them
had
had
an
english
education
he
had
learnt
to
repeat
the
phrases
of
the
day
it
is
not
only
a
question
of
orthodoxy
he
argued
our
country
is
mainly
agricultural
and
cows
are
buffaloes
in
this
country
i
interrupted
likewise
give
milk
and
are
used
for
ploughing
and
therefore
so
long
as
we
dance
frantic
dances
on
our
temple
pavements
smeared
with
their
blood
their
severed
heads
carried
on
our
shoulders
religion
will
only
laugh
at
us
if
we
quarrel
with
mussulmans
in
her
name
and
nothing
but
the
quarrel
itself
will
remain
true
if
the
cow
alone
is
to
be
held
sacred
from
slaughter
and
not
the
buffalo
then
that
is
bigotry
not
religion
but
are
you
not
aware
sir
of
what
is
behind
all
this
pursued
the
tenant
this
has
only
become
possible
because
the
mussulman
is
assured
of
safety
even
if
he
breaks
the
law
have
you
not
heard
of
the
pachur
case
why
is
it
possible
i
asked
to
use
the
mussulmans
thus
as
tools
against
us
is
it
not
because
we
have
fashioned
them
into
such
with
our
own
intolerance
that
is
how
providence
punishes
us
our
accumulated
sins
are
being
visited
on
our
own
heads
oh
well
if
that
be
so
let
them
be
visited
on
us
but
we
shall
have
our
revenge
we
have
undermined
what
was
the
greatest
strength
of
the
authorities
their
devotion
to
their
own
laws
once
they
were
truly
kings
dispensing
justice
now
they
themselves
will
become
and
so
no
better
than
robbers
this
may
not
go
down
to
history
but
we
shall
carry
it
in
our
hearts
for
all
time
the
evil
reports
about
me
which
are
spreading
from
paper
to
paper
are
making
me
notorious
news
comes
that
my
effigy
has
been
burnt
at
the
of
the
chakravartis
with
due
ceremony
and
enthusiasm
and
other
insults
are
in
contemplation
the
trouble
was
that
they
had
come
to
ask
me
to
take
shares
in
a
cotton
mill
they
wanted
to
start
i
had
to
tell
them
that
i
did
not
so
much
mind
the
loss
of
my
own
money
but
i
would
not
be
a
party
to
causing
a
loss
to
so
many
poor
shareholders
are
we
to
understand
maharaja
said
my
visitors
that
the
prosperity
of
the
country
does
not
interest
you
industry
may
lead
to
the
country
prosperity
i
explained
but
a
mere
desire
for
its
prosperity
will
not
make
for
success
in
industry
even
when
our
heads
were
cool
our
industries
did
not
flourish
why
should
we
suppose
that
they
will
do
so
just
because
we
have
become
frantic
why
not
say
plainly
that
you
will
not
risk
your
money
i
will
put
in
my
money
when
i
see
that
it
is
industry
which
prompts
you
but
because
you
have
lighted
a
fire
it
does
not
follow
that
you
have
the
food
to
cook
over
it
xiii
what
is
this
our
chakua
looted
a
remittance
of
seven
thousand
five
hundred
rupees
was
due
from
there
to
headquarters
the
local
cashier
had
changed
the
cash
at
the
government
treasury
into
small
currency
notes
for
convenience
in
carrying
and
had
kept
them
ready
in
bundles
in
the
middle
of
the
night
an
armed
band
had
raided
the
room
and
wounded
kasim
the
man
on
guard
the
curious
part
of
it
was
that
they
had
taken
only
six
thousand
rupees
and
left
the
rest
scattered
on
the
floor
though
it
would
have
been
as
easy
to
carry
that
away
also
anyhow
the
raid
of
the
dacoits
was
over
now
the
police
raid
would
begin
peace
was
out
of
the
question
when
i
went
inside
i
found
the
news
had
travelled
before
me
what
a
terrible
thing
brother
exclaimed
the
bara
rani
whatever
shall
we
do
i
made
light
of
the
matter
to
reassure
her
we
still
have
something
left
i
said
with
a
smile
we
shall
manage
to
get
along
somehow
do
joke
about
it
brother
dear
why
are
they
all
so
angry
with
you
ca
you
humour
them
why
put
everybody
out
i
can
not
let
the
country
go
to
rack
and
ruin
even
if
that
would
please
everybody
that
was
a
shocking
thing
they
did
at
the
a
horrid
shame
to
treat
you
so
the
chota
rani
has
got
rid
of
all
her
fears
by
dint
of
the
englishwoman
teaching
but
as
for
me
i
had
to
send
for
the
priest
to
avert
the
omen
before
i
could
get
any
peace
of
mind
for
my
sake
dear
do
get
away
to
calcutta
i
tremble
to
think
what
they
may
do
if
you
stay
on
here
my
genuine
anxiety
touched
me
deeply
and
brother
she
went
on
did
i
not
warn
you
it
was
not
well
to
keep
so
much
money
in
your
room
they
might
get
wind
of
it
any
day
it
is
not
the
money
but
who
knows
to
calm
her
i
promised
to
remove
the
money
to
the
treasury
at
once
and
then
get
it
away
to
calcutta
with
the
first
escort
going
we
went
together
to
my
bedroom
the
door
was
shut
when
i
knocked
bimala
called
out
i
am
dressing
i
wonder
at
the
chota
rani
exclaimed
my
dressing
so
early
in
the
day
one
of
their
meetings
i
suppose
robber
queen
she
called
out
in
jest
to
bimala
are
you
counting
your
spoils
inside
i
will
attend
to
the
money
a
little
later
i
said
as
i
came
away
to
my
office
room
outside
i
found
the
police
inspector
waiting
for
me
any
trace
of
the
dacoits
i
asked
i
have
my
suspicions
on
whom
kasim
the
guard
kasim
but
was
he
not
wounded
a
mere
nothing
a
flesh
wound
on
the
leg
probably
inflicted
but
i
can
not
bring
myself
to
believe
it
he
is
such
a
trusted
servant
you
may
have
trusted
him
but
that
does
not
prevent
his
being
a
thief
have
i
not
seen
men
trusted
for
twenty
years
together
suddenly
developing
even
if
it
were
so
i
could
not
send
him
to
gaol
but
why
should
he
have
left
the
rest
of
the
money
lying
about
to
put
us
off
the
scent
whatever
you
may
say
maharaja
he
must
be
an
old
hand
at
the
game
he
mounts
guard
during
his
watch
right
enough
but
i
feel
sure
he
has
a
finger
in
all
the
dacoities
going
on
in
the
neighbourhood
with
this
the
inspector
proceeded
to
recount
the
various
methods
by
which
it
was
possible
to
be
concerned
in
a
dacoity
twenty
or
thirty
miles
away
and
yet
be
back
in
time
for
duty
have
you
brought
kasim
here
i
asked
no
was
the
reply
he
is
in
the
the
magistrate
is
due
for
the
investigation
i
want
to
see
him
i
said
when
i
went
to
his
cell
he
fell
at
my
feet
weeping
in
name
he
said
i
swear
i
did
not
do
this
thing
i
do
not
doubt
you
kasim
i
assured
him
fear
nothing
they
can
do
nothing
to
you
if
you
are
innocent
kasim
however
was
unable
to
give
a
coherent
account
of
the
incident
he
was
obviously
exaggerating
four
or
five
hundred
men
big
guns
numberless
swords
figured
in
his
narrative
it
must
have
been
either
his
disturbed
state
of
mind
or
a
desire
to
account
for
his
easy
defeat
he
would
have
it
that
this
was
harish
kundu
doing
he
was
even
sure
he
had
heard
the
voice
of
ekram
the
head
retainer
of
the
kundus
look
here
kasim
i
had
to
warn
him
do
you
be
dragging
other
people
in
with
your
stories
you
are
not
called
upon
to
make
out
a
case
against
harish
kundu
or
anybody
else
xiv
on
returning
home
i
asked
my
master
to
come
over
he
shook
his
head
gravely
i
see
no
good
in
this
said
he
this
setting
aside
of
conscience
and
putting
the
country
in
its
place
all
the
sins
of
the
country
will
now
break
out
hideous
and
unashamed
who
do
you
think
could
have
do
ask
me
but
sin
is
rampant
send
them
all
away
right
away
from
here
i
have
given
them
one
more
day
they
will
be
leaving
the
day
after
tomorrow
and
another
thing
take
bimala
away
to
calcutta
she
is
getting
too
narrow
a
view
of
the
outside
world
from
here
she
can
not
see
men
and
things
in
their
true
proportions
let
her
see
the
world
men
and
their
work
give
her
abroad
vision
that
is
exactly
what
i
was
thinking
well
do
make
any
delay
about
it
i
tell
you
nikhil
history
has
to
be
built
by
the
united
effort
of
all
the
races
in
the
world
and
therefore
this
selling
of
conscience
for
political
reasons
this
making
a
fetish
of
one
country
wo
do
i
know
that
europe
does
not
at
heart
admit
this
but
there
she
has
not
the
right
to
pose
as
our
teacher
men
who
die
for
the
truth
become
immortal
and
if
a
whole
people
can
die
for
the
truth
it
will
also
achieve
immortality
in
the
history
of
humanity
here
in
this
land
of
india
amid
the
mocking
laughter
of
satan
piercing
the
sky
may
the
feeling
for
this
truth
become
real
what
a
terrible
epidemic
of
sin
has
been
brought
into
our
country
from
foreign
lands
the
whole
day
passed
in
the
turmoil
of
investigation
i
was
tired
out
when
i
retired
for
the
night
i
left
over
sending
my
money
to
the
treasury
till
next
morning
i
woke
up
from
my
sleep
at
dead
of
night
the
room
was
dark
i
thought
i
heard
a
moaning
somewhere
somebody
must
have
been
crying
sounds
of
sobbing
came
heavy
with
tears
like
fitful
gusts
of
wind
in
the
rainy
night
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
cry
rose
from
the
heart
of
my
room
itself
i
was
alone
for
some
days
bimala
had
her
bed
in
another
room
adjoining
mine
i
rose
up
and
when
i
went
out
i
found
her
in
the
balcony
lying
prone
upon
her
face
on
the
bare
floor
this
is
something
that
can
not
be
written
in
words
he
only
knows
it
who
sits
in
the
bosom
of
the
world
and
receives
all
its
pangs
in
his
own
heart
the
sky
is
dumb
the
stars
are
mute
the
night
is
still
and
in
the
midst
of
it
all
that
one
sleepless
cry
we
give
these
sufferings
names
bad
or
good
according
to
the
classifications
of
the
books
but
this
agony
which
is
welling
up
from
a
torn
heart
pouring
into
the
fathomless
dark
has
it
any
name
when
in
that
midnight
standing
under
the
silent
stars
i
looked
upon
that
figure
my
mind
was
struck
with
awe
and
i
said
to
myself
who
am
ito
judge
her
o
life
o
death
o
god
of
the
infinite
existence
i
bow
my
head
in
silence
to
the
mystery
which
is
in
you
once
i
thought
i
should
turn
back
but
i
could
not
i
sat
down
on
the
ground
near
bimala
and
placed
my
hand
on
her
head
at
the
first
touch
her
whole
body
seemed
to
stiffen
but
the
next
moment
the
hardness
gave
way
and
the
tears
burst
out
i
gently
passed
my
fingers
over
her
forehead
suddenly
her
hands
groping
for
my
feet
grasped
them
and
drew
them
to
herself
pressing
them
against
her
breast
with
such
force
that
i
thought
her
heart
would
break
bimala
story
xviii
amulya
is
due
to
return
from
calcutta
this
morning
i
told
the
servants
to
let
me
know
as
soon
as
he
arrived
but
could
not
keep
still
at
last
i
went
outside
to
await
him
in
the
when
i
sent
him
off
to
sell
the
jewels
i
must
have
been
thinking
only
of
myself
it
never
even
crossed
my
mind
that
so
young
a
boy
trying
to
sell
such
valuable
jewellery
would
at
once
be
suspected
so
helpless
are
we
women
we
needs
must
place
on
others
the
burden
of
our
danger
when
we
go
to
our
death
we
drag
down
those
who
are
about
us
i
had
said
with
pride
that
i
would
save
amulya
as
if
she
who
was
drowning
could
save
others
but
instead
of
saving
him
i
have
sent
him
to
his
doom
my
little
brother
such
a
sister
have
i
been
to
you
that
death
must
have
smiled
on
that
brothers
day
when
i
gave
you
my
blessing
i
who
wander
distracted
with
the
burden
of
my
own
i
feel
today
that
man
is
at
times
attacked
with
evil
as
with
the
plague
some
germ
finds
its
way
in
from
somewhere
and
then
in
the
space
of
one
night
death
stalks
in
why
can
not
the
stricken
one
be
kept
far
away
from
the
rest
of
the
world
i
at
least
have
realized
how
terrible
is
the
contagion
like
a
fiery
torch
which
burns
that
it
may
set
the
world
on
fire
it
struck
nine
i
could
not
get
rid
of
the
idea
that
amulya
was
in
trouble
that
he
had
fallen
into
the
clutches
of
the
police
there
must
be
great
excitement
in
the
police
office
whose
are
the
jewels
where
did
he
get
them
and
in
the
end
i
shall
have
to
furnish
the
answer
in
public
before
all
the
world
what
is
that
answer
to
be
your
day
has
come
at
last
bara
rani
you
whom
i
have
so
long
despised
you
in
the
shape
of
the
public
the
world
will
have
your
revenge
o
god
save
me
this
time
and
i
will
cast
all
my
pride
at
my
feet
i
could
bear
it
no
longer
i
went
straight
to
the
bara
rani
she
was
in
the
verandah
spicing
her
betel
leaves
thako
at
her
side
the
sight
of
thako
made
me
shrink
back
for
a
moment
but
i
overcame
all
hesitation
and
making
a
low
obeisance
i
took
the
dust
of
my
elder
feet
bless
my
soul
chota
rani
she
exclaimed
what
has
come
upon
you
why
this
sudden
reverence
it
is
my
birthday
sister
said
i
i
have
caused
you
pain
give
me
your
blessing
today
that
i
may
never
do
so
again
my
mind
is
so
small
i
repeated
my
obeisance
and
left
her
hurriedly
but
she
called
me
back
you
never
before
told
me
that
this
was
your
birthday
chotie
darling
be
sure
to
come
and
have
lunch
with
me
this
afternoon
you
positively
must
o
god
let
it
really
be
my
birthday
today
can
i
not
be
born
over
again
cleanse
me
my
god
and
purify
me
and
give
me
one
more
trial
i
went
again
to
the
to
find
sandip
there
a
feeling
of
disgust
seemed
to
poison
my
very
blood
the
face
of
his
which
i
saw
in
the
morning
light
had
nothing
of
the
magic
radiance
of
genius
will
you
leave
the
room
i
blurted
out
sandip
smiled
since
amulya
is
not
here
he
remarked
i
should
think
my
turn
had
come
for
a
special
talk
my
fate
was
coming
back
upon
me
how
was
ito
take
away
the
right
i
myself
had
given
i
would
be
alone
i
repeated
queen
he
said
the
presence
of
another
person
does
not
prevent
your
being
alone
do
not
mistake
me
for
one
of
the
crowd
i
sandip
am
always
alone
even
when
surrounded
by
thousands
please
come
some
other
time
this
morning
i
am
waiting
for
amulya
i
turned
to
leave
the
room
for
sheer
vexation
when
sandip
drew
out
from
the
folds
of
his
cloak
that
of
mine
and
banged
it
down
on
the
marble
table
i
was
thoroughly
startled
has
not
amulya
gone
then
i
exclaimed
gone
where
to
calcutta
no
chuckled
sandip
ah
then
my
blessing
had
come
true
in
spite
of
all
he
was
saved
let
god
punishment
fall
on
me
the
thief
if
only
amulya
be
safe
the
change
in
my
countenance
roused
sandip
scorn
so
pleased
queen
sneered
he
are
these
jewels
so
very
precious
how
then
did
you
bring
yourself
to
offer
them
to
the
goddess
your
gift
was
actually
made
would
you
now
take
it
back
pride
dies
hard
and
raises
its
fangs
to
the
last
it
was
clear
to
me
i
must
show
sandip
i
did
not
care
a
rap
about
these
jewels
if
they
have
excited
your
greed
i
said
you
may
have
them
my
greed
today
embraces
the
wealth
of
all
bengal
replied
sandip
is
there
a
greater
force
than
greed
it
is
the
steed
of
the
great
ones
of
the
earth
as
is
the
elephant
airauat
the
steed
of
indra
so
then
these
jewels
are
mine
as
sandip
took
up
and
replaced
the
casket
under
his
cloak
amulya
rushed
in
there
were
dark
rings
under
his
eyes
his
lips
were
dry
his
hair
tumbled
the
freshness
of
his
youth
seemed
to
have
withered
in
a
single
day
pangs
gripped
my
heart
as
i
looked
on
him
my
box
he
cried
as
he
went
straight
up
to
sandip
without
a
glance
at
me
have
you
taken
that
from
my
trunk
your
mocked
sandip
it
was
my
trunk
sandip
burst
out
into
a
laugh
your
distinctions
between
mine
and
yours
are
getting
rather
thin
amulya
he
cried
you
will
die
a
religious
preacher
yet
i
see
amulya
sank
on
a
chair
with
his
face
in
his
hands
i
went
up
to
him
and
placing
my
hand
on
his
head
asked
him
what
is
your
trouble
amulya
he
stood
straight
up
as
he
replied
i
had
set
my
heart
sister
rani
on
returning
your
jewels
to
you
with
my
own
hand
sandip
babu
knew
this
but
he
forestalled
me
what
do
i
care
for
my
jewels
i
said
let
them
go
no
harm
is
done
go
where
asked
the
mystified
boy
the
jewels
are
mine
said
sandip
insignia
bestowed
on
me
by
my
queen
no
no
no
broke
out
amulya
wildly
never
sister
rani
i
brought
them
back
for
you
you
shall
not
give
them
away
to
anybody
else
i
accept
your
gift
my
little
brother
said
i
but
let
him
who
hankers
after
them
satisfy
his
greed
amulya
glared
at
sandip
like
a
beast
of
prey
as
he
growled
look
here
sandip
babu
you
know
that
even
hanging
has
no
terrors
for
me
if
you
dare
take
away
that
box
of
jewels
with
an
attempt
at
a
sarcastic
laugh
sandip
said
you
also
ought
to
know
by
this
time
amulya
that
i
am
not
the
man
to
be
afraid
of
you
queen
bee
he
went
on
turning
to
me
i
did
not
come
here
today
to
take
these
jewels
i
came
to
give
them
to
you
you
would
have
done
wrong
to
take
my
gift
at
amulya
hands
in
order
to
prevent
it
i
had
first
to
make
them
clearly
mine
now
these
my
jewels
are
my
gift
to
you
here
they
are
patch
up
any
understanding
with
this
boy
you
like
i
must
go
you
have
been
at
your
special
talks
all
these
days
together
leaving
me
out
of
them
if
special
happenings
now
come
to
pass
do
blame
me
amulya
he
continued
i
have
sent
on
your
trunks
and
things
to
your
lodgings
do
you
be
keeping
any
belongings
of
yours
in
my
room
any
longer
with
this
parting
shot
sandip
flung
out
of
the
room
xix
i
have
had
no
peace
of
mind
amulya
i
said
to
him
ever
since
i
sent
you
off
to
sell
my
jewels
why
sister
rani
i
was
afraid
lest
you
should
get
into
trouble
with
them
lest
they
should
suspect
you
for
a
thief
i
would
rather
go
without
that
six
thousand
you
must
now
do
another
thing
for
me
go
home
at
once
home
to
your
mother
amulya
produced
a
small
bundle
and
said
but
sister
i
have
got
the
six
thousand
where
from
i
tried
hard
to
get
gold
he
went
on
without
replying
to
my
question
but
could
not
so
i
had
to
bring
it
in
notes
tell
me
truly
amulya
swear
by
me
where
did
you
get
this
money
that
i
will
not
tell
you
everything
seemed
to
grow
dark
before
my
eyes
what
terrible
thing
have
you
done
amulya
i
cried
is
it
then
i
know
you
will
say
i
got
this
money
wrongly
very
well
i
admit
it
but
i
have
paid
the
full
price
for
my
so
now
the
money
is
mine
i
no
longer
had
any
desire
to
learn
more
about
it
my
very
contracted
making
my
whole
body
shrink
within
itself
take
it
away
amulya
i
implored
put
it
back
where
you
got
it
from
that
would
be
hard
indeed
it
is
not
hard
brother
dear
it
was
an
evil
moment
when
you
first
came
to
me
even
sandip
has
not
been
able
to
harm
you
as
i
have
done
sandip
name
seemed
to
stab
him
sandip
he
cried
it
was
you
alone
who
made
me
come
to
know
that
man
for
what
he
is
do
you
know
sister
he
has
not
spent
a
pice
out
of
those
sovereigns
he
took
from
you
he
shut
himself
into
his
room
after
he
left
you
and
gloated
over
the
gold
pouring
it
out
in
a
heap
on
the
floor
is
not
money
he
exclaimed
the
petals
of
the
divine
lotus
of
power
crystallized
strains
of
music
from
the
pipes
that
play
in
the
paradise
of
wealth
i
can
not
find
it
in
my
heart
to
change
them
for
they
seem
longing
to
fulfil
their
destiny
of
adorning
the
neck
of
beauty
amulya
my
boy
do
you
look
at
these
with
your
fleshly
eye
they
are
lakshmi
smile
the
gracious
radiance
of
indra
queen
no
no
i
ca
give
them
up
to
that
boor
of
a
manager
i
am
sure
amulya
he
was
telling
us
lies
the
police
have
traced
the
man
who
sank
that
boat
it
the
manager
who
wants
to
make
something
out
of
it
we
must
get
those
letters
back
from
him
i
asked
him
how
we
were
to
do
this
he
told
me
to
use
force
or
threats
i
offered
to
do
so
if
he
would
return
the
gold
that
he
said
we
could
consider
later
i
will
not
trouble
you
sister
with
all
i
did
to
frighten
the
man
into
giving
up
those
letters
and
burn
them
it
is
a
long
story
that
very
night
i
came
to
sandip
and
said
are
now
safe
let
me
have
the
sovereigns
to
return
them
tomorrow
to
my
sister
the
maharani
but
he
cried
infatuation
is
this
of
yours
your
precious
sister
skirt
bids
fair
to
hide
the
whole
country
from
you
say
and
exorcize
the
evil
spirit
you
know
sister
rani
the
power
of
sandip
magic
the
gold
remained
with
him
and
i
spent
the
whole
dark
night
on
the
of
the
lake
muttering
then
when
you
gave
me
your
jewels
to
sell
i
went
again
to
sandip
i
could
see
he
was
angry
with
me
but
he
tried
not
to
show
it
i
still
have
them
hoarded
up
in
any
box
of
mine
you
may
take
them
said
he
as
he
flung
me
his
keys
they
were
nowhere
to
be
seen
me
where
they
are
i
said
will
do
so
he
replied
i
find
your
infatuation
has
left
you
not
now
when
i
found
i
could
not
move
him
i
had
to
employ
other
methods
then
i
tried
to
get
the
sovereigns
from
him
in
exchange
for
my
currency
notes
for
six
thousand
rupees
shall
have
them
he
said
and
disappeared
into
his
bedroom
leaving
me
waiting
outside
there
he
broke
open
my
trunk
and
came
straight
to
you
with
your
casket
through
some
other
passage
he
would
not
let
me
bring
it
and
now
he
dares
call
it
his
gift
how
can
i
tell
how
much
he
has
deprived
me
of
i
shall
never
forgive
him
but
oh
sister
his
power
over
me
has
been
utterly
broken
and
it
is
you
who
have
broken
it
brother
dear
said
i
if
that
is
so
then
my
life
is
justified
but
more
remains
to
be
done
amulya
it
is
not
enough
that
the
spell
has
been
destroyed
its
stains
must
be
washed
away
do
delay
any
longer
go
at
once
and
put
back
the
money
where
you
took
it
from
can
you
not
do
it
dear
with
your
blessing
everything
is
possible
sister
rani
remember
it
will
not
be
your
expiation
alone
but
mine
also
i
am
a
woman
the
outside
world
is
closed
to
me
else
i
would
have
gone
myself
my
hardest
punishment
is
that
i
must
put
on
you
the
burden
of
my
sin
do
say
that
sister
the
path
i
was
treading
was
not
your
path
it
attracted
me
because
of
its
dangers
and
difficulties
now
that
your
path
calls
me
let
it
be
a
thousand
times
more
difficult
and
dangerous
the
dust
of
your
feet
will
help
me
to
win
through
is
it
then
your
command
that
this
money
be
replaced
not
my
command
brother
mine
but
a
command
from
above
of
that
i
know
nothing
it
is
enough
for
me
that
this
command
from
above
comes
from
your
lips
and
sister
i
thought
i
had
an
invitation
here
i
must
not
lose
that
you
must
give
me
your
before
i
go
then
if
i
can
possibly
manage
it
i
will
finish
my
duty
in
the
evening
tears
came
to
my
eyes
when
i
tried
to
smile
as
i
said
so
be
it
food
consecrated
by
the
touch
of
a
revered
person
chapter
eleven
bimala
story
xx
with
amulya
departure
my
heart
sank
within
me
on
what
perilous
adventure
had
i
sent
this
only
son
of
his
mother
o
god
why
need
my
expiation
have
such
pomp
and
circumstance
could
i
not
be
allowed
to
suffer
alone
without
inviting
all
this
multitude
to
share
my
punishment
oh
let
not
this
innocent
child
fall
victim
to
your
wrath
i
called
him
back
amulya
my
voice
sounded
so
feebly
it
failed
to
reach
him
i
went
up
to
the
door
and
called
again
amulya
he
had
gone
who
is
there
rani
mother
go
and
tell
amulya
babu
that
i
want
him
what
exactly
happened
i
could
not
make
out
the
man
perhaps
was
not
familiar
with
amulya
name
but
he
returned
almost
at
once
followed
by
sandip
the
very
moment
you
sent
me
away
he
said
as
he
came
in
i
had
a
presentiment
that
you
would
call
me
back
the
attraction
of
the
same
moon
causes
both
ebb
and
flow
i
was
so
sure
of
being
sent
for
that
i
was
actually
waiting
out
in
the
passage
as
soon
as
i
caught
sight
of
your
man
coming
from
your
room
i
said
yes
i
am
coming
i
am
coming
at
once
before
he
could
utter
a
word
that
lout
was
surprised
i
can
tell
you
he
stared
at
me
as
if
he
thought
i
knew
magic
all
the
fights
in
the
world
queen
bee
sandip
rambled
on
are
really
fights
between
hypnotic
forces
spell
cast
against
spell
noiseless
weapons
which
reach
even
invisible
targets
at
last
i
have
met
in
you
my
match
your
quiver
is
full
i
know
you
artful
warrior
queen
you
are
the
only
one
in
the
world
who
has
been
able
to
turn
sandip
out
and
call
sandip
back
at
your
sweet
will
well
your
quarry
is
at
your
feet
what
will
you
do
with
him
now
will
you
give
him
the
coup
de
grâce
or
keep
him
in
your
cage
let
me
warn
you
beforehand
queen
you
will
find
the
beast
as
difficult
to
kill
outright
as
to
keep
in
bondage
anyway
why
lose
time
in
trying
your
magic
weapons
sandip
must
have
felt
the
shadow
of
approaching
defeat
and
this
made
him
try
to
gain
time
by
chattering
away
without
waiting
for
a
reply
i
believe
he
knew
that
i
had
sent
the
messenger
for
amulya
whose
name
the
man
must
have
mentioned
in
spite
of
that
he
had
deliberately
played
this
trick
he
was
now
trying
to
avoid
giving
me
any
opening
to
tell
him
that
it
was
amulya
i
wanted
not
him
but
his
stratagem
was
futile
for
i
could
see
his
weakness
through
it
i
must
not
yield
up
a
pin
point
of
the
ground
i
had
gained
sandip
babu
i
said
i
wonder
how
you
can
go
on
making
these
endless
speeches
without
a
stop
do
you
get
them
up
by
heart
beforehand
sandip
face
flushed
instantly
i
have
heard
i
continued
that
our
professional
reciters
keep
a
book
full
of
all
kinds
of
discourses
which
can
be
fitted
into
any
subject
have
you
also
a
book
sandip
ground
out
his
reply
through
his
teeth
god
has
given
you
women
a
plentiful
supply
of
coquetry
to
start
with
and
on
the
top
of
that
you
have
the
milliner
and
the
jeweller
to
help
you
but
do
not
think
we
men
are
so
helpless
you
had
better
go
back
and
look
up
your
book
sandip
babu
you
are
getting
your
words
all
wrong
that
just
the
trouble
with
trying
to
repeat
things
by
rote
you
shouted
sandip
losing
all
control
over
himself
you
to
insult
me
thus
what
is
there
left
of
you
that
i
do
not
know
to
the
very
bottom
what
he
became
speechless
sandip
the
wielder
of
magic
spells
is
reduced
to
utter
powerlessness
whenever
his
spell
refuses
to
work
from
a
king
he
fell
to
the
level
of
a
boor
oh
the
joy
of
witnessing
his
weakness
the
harsher
he
became
in
his
rudeness
the
more
did
this
joy
well
up
within
me
his
snaky
coils
with
which
he
used
to
snare
me
are
exhausted
i
am
free
i
am
saved
saved
be
rude
to
me
insult
me
for
that
shows
you
in
your
truth
but
spare
me
your
songs
of
praise
which
were
false
my
husband
came
in
at
this
juncture
sandip
had
not
the
elasticity
to
recover
himself
in
a
moment
as
he
used
to
do
before
my
husband
looked
at
him
for
a
while
in
surprise
had
this
happened
some
days
ago
i
should
have
felt
ashamed
but
today
i
was
pleased
whatever
my
husband
might
think
i
wanted
to
have
it
out
to
the
finish
with
my
weakening
adversary
finding
us
both
silent
and
constrained
my
husband
hesitated
a
little
and
then
took
a
chair
sandip
he
said
i
have
been
looking
for
you
and
was
told
you
were
here
i
am
here
said
sandip
with
some
emphasis
queen
bee
sent
for
me
early
this
morning
and
i
the
humble
worker
of
the
hive
left
all
else
to
attend
her
summons
i
am
going
to
calcutta
tomorrow
you
will
come
with
me
and
why
pray
do
you
take
me
for
one
of
your
retinue
oh
very
well
take
it
that
you
are
going
to
calcutta
and
that
i
am
your
follower
i
have
no
business
there
all
the
more
reason
for
going
you
have
too
much
business
here
i
do
propose
to
stir
then
i
propose
to
shift
you
forcibly
forcibly
very
well
then
i
will
make
a
move
but
the
world
is
not
divided
between
calcutta
and
your
estates
there
are
other
places
on
the
map
from
the
way
you
have
been
going
on
one
would
hardly
have
thought
that
there
was
any
other
place
in
the
world
except
my
estates
sandip
stood
up
it
does
happen
at
times
he
said
that
a
man
whole
world
is
reduced
to
a
single
spot
i
have
realized
my
universe
in
this
of
yours
that
is
why
i
have
been
a
fixture
here
then
he
turned
to
me
none
but
you
queen
bee
he
said
will
understand
my
words
perhaps
not
even
you
i
salute
you
with
worship
in
my
heart
i
leave
you
my
watchword
has
changed
since
you
have
come
across
my
vision
it
is
no
longer
hail
mother
but
hail
beloved
hail
enchantress
the
mother
protects
the
mistress
leads
to
destruction
but
sweet
is
that
destruction
you
have
made
the
anklet
sounds
of
the
dance
of
death
tinkle
in
my
heart
you
have
changed
for
me
your
devotee
the
picture
i
had
of
this
bengal
of
ours
soft
land
of
pure
water
and
sweet
fruit
you
have
no
pity
my
beloved
you
have
come
to
me
with
your
poison
cup
and
i
shall
drain
it
either
to
die
in
agony
or
live
triumphing
over
death
yes
he
continued
the
mother
day
is
past
o
love
my
love
you
have
made
as
naught
for
me
the
truth
and
right
and
heaven
itself
all
duties
have
become
as
shadows
all
rules
and
restraints
have
snapped
their
bonds
o
love
my
love
i
could
set
fire
to
all
the
world
outside
this
land
on
which
you
have
set
your
dainty
feet
and
dance
in
mad
revel
over
the
ashes
these
are
mild
men
these
are
good
men
they
would
do
good
to
all
as
if
this
all
were
a
reality
no
no
there
is
no
reality
in
the
world
save
this
one
real
love
of
mine
i
do
you
reverence
my
devotion
to
you
has
made
me
cruel
my
worship
of
you
has
lighted
the
raging
flame
of
destruction
within
me
i
am
not
righteous
i
have
no
beliefs
i
only
believe
in
her
whom
above
all
else
in
the
world
i
have
been
able
to
realize
wonderful
it
was
wonderful
indeed
only
a
minute
ago
i
had
despised
this
man
with
all
my
heart
but
what
i
had
thought
to
be
dead
ashes
now
glowed
with
living
fire
the
fire
in
him
is
true
that
is
beyond
doubt
oh
why
has
god
made
man
such
a
mixed
creature
was
it
only
to
show
his
supernatural
sleight
of
hand
only
a
few
minutes
ago
i
had
thought
that
sandip
whom
i
had
once
taken
to
be
a
hero
was
only
the
stage
hero
of
melodrama
but
that
is
not
so
not
so
even
behind
the
trappings
of
the
theatre
a
true
hero
may
sometimes
be
lurking
there
is
much
in
sandip
that
is
coarse
that
is
sensuous
that
is
false
much
that
is
overlaid
with
layer
after
layer
of
fleshly
covering
yet
yet
it
is
best
to
confess
that
there
is
a
great
deal
in
the
depths
of
him
which
we
do
not
can
not
understand
much
in
ourselves
too
a
wonderful
thing
is
man
what
great
mysterious
purpose
he
is
working
out
only
the
terrible
one
knows
meanwhile
we
groan
under
the
brunt
of
it
shiva
is
the
lord
of
chaos
he
is
all
joy
he
will
destroy
our
bonds
i
can
not
but
feel
again
and
again
that
there
are
two
persons
in
me
one
recoils
from
sandip
in
his
terrible
aspect
of
chaos
the
other
feels
that
very
vision
to
be
sweetly
alluring
the
sinking
ship
drags
down
all
who
are
swimming
round
it
sandip
is
just
such
a
force
of
destruction
his
immense
attraction
gets
hold
of
one
before
fear
can
come
to
the
rescue
and
then
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
one
is
drawn
away
irresistibly
from
all
light
all
good
all
freedom
of
the
sky
all
air
that
can
be
breathed
from
lifelong
accumulations
from
everyday
cares
right
to
the
bottom
of
dissolution
from
some
realm
of
calamity
has
sandip
come
as
its
messenger
and
as
he
stalks
the
land
muttering
unholy
incantations
to
him
flock
all
the
boys
and
youths
the
mother
seated
in
the
heart
of
the
country
is
wailing
her
heart
out
for
they
have
broken
open
her
there
to
hold
their
drunken
revelry
her
vintage
of
the
draught
for
the
immortals
they
would
pour
out
on
the
dust
her
vessels
they
would
smash
to
pieces
true
i
feel
with
her
but
at
the
same
time
i
can
not
help
being
infected
with
their
excitement
truth
itself
has
sent
us
this
temptation
to
test
our
trustiness
in
upholding
its
commandments
intoxication
masquerades
in
heavenly
garb
and
dances
before
the
pilgrims
saying
fools
you
are
that
pursue
the
fruitless
path
of
renunciation
its
way
is
long
its
time
passing
slow
so
the
wielder
of
the
thunderbolt
has
sent
me
to
you
behold
i
the
beautiful
the
passionate
i
will
accept
you
in
my
embrace
you
shall
find
fulfilment
after
a
pause
sandip
addressed
me
again
goddess
the
time
has
come
for
me
to
leave
you
it
is
well
the
work
of
your
nearness
has
been
done
by
lingering
longer
it
would
only
become
undone
again
little
by
little
all
is
lost
if
in
our
greed
we
try
to
cheapen
that
which
is
the
greatest
thing
on
earth
that
which
is
eternal
within
the
moment
only
becomes
shallow
if
spread
out
in
time
we
were
about
to
spoil
our
infinite
moment
when
it
was
your
uplifted
thunderbolt
which
came
to
the
rescue
you
intervened
to
save
the
purity
of
your
own
worship
and
in
so
doing
you
also
saved
your
worshipper
in
my
today
your
worship
stands
out
the
biggest
thing
goddess
i
also
set
you
free
today
my
earthen
temple
could
hold
you
no
longer
every
moment
it
was
on
the
point
of
breaking
apart
today
i
depart
to
worship
your
larger
image
in
a
larger
temple
i
can
gain
you
more
truly
only
at
a
distance
from
yourself
here
i
had
only
your
favour
there
i
shall
be
vouchsafed
your
boon
my
was
lying
on
the
table
i
held
it
up
aloft
as
i
said
i
charge
you
to
convey
these
my
jewels
to
the
object
of
my
worship
to
whom
i
have
dedicated
them
through
you
my
husband
remained
silent
sandip
left
the
room
quotation
from
the
national
song
rudra
the
terrible
a
name
of
shiva
xxi
i
had
just
sat
down
to
make
some
cakes
for
amulya
when
the
bara
rani
came
upon
the
scene
oh
dear
she
exclaimed
has
it
come
to
this
that
you
must
make
cakes
for
your
own
birthday
is
there
no
one
else
for
whom
i
could
be
making
them
i
asked
but
this
is
not
the
day
when
you
should
think
of
feasting
others
it
is
for
us
to
feast
you
i
was
just
thinking
of
making
something
up
when
i
heard
the
staggering
news
which
completely
upset
me
a
gang
of
five
or
six
hundred
men
they
say
has
raided
one
of
our
treasuries
and
made
off
with
six
thousand
rupees
our
house
will
be
looted
next
they
expect
i
felt
greatly
relieved
so
it
was
our
own
money
after
all
i
wanted
to
send
for
amulya
at
once
and
tell
him
that
he
need
only
hand
over
those
notes
to
my
husband
and
leave
the
explanations
to
me
you
are
a
wonderful
creature
my
broke
out
at
the
change
in
my
countenance
have
you
then
really
no
such
thing
as
fear
i
can
not
believe
it
i
said
why
should
they
loot
our
house
not
believe
it
indeed
who
could
have
believed
that
they
would
attack
our
treasury
either
i
made
no
reply
but
bent
over
my
cakes
putting
in
the
stuffing
well
i
off
said
the
bara
rani
after
a
prolonged
stare
at
me
i
must
see
brother
nikhil
and
get
something
done
about
sending
off
my
money
to
calcutta
before
it
too
late
she
was
no
sooner
gone
than
i
left
the
cakes
to
take
care
of
themselves
and
rushed
to
my
shutting
myself
inside
my
husband
tunic
with
the
keys
in
its
pocket
was
still
hanging
there
so
forgetful
was
he
i
took
the
key
of
the
iron
safe
off
the
ring
and
kept
it
by
me
hidden
in
the
folds
of
my
dress
then
there
came
a
knocking
at
the
door
i
am
dressing
i
called
out
i
could
hear
the
bara
rani
saying
only
a
minute
ago
i
saw
her
making
cakes
and
now
she
is
busy
dressing
up
what
next
i
wonder
one
of
their
meetings
is
on
i
suppose
i
say
robber
queen
she
called
out
to
me
are
you
taking
stock
of
your
loot
when
they
went
away
i
hardly
know
what
made
me
open
the
safe
perhaps
there
was
a
lurking
hope
that
it
might
all
be
a
dream
what
if
on
pulling
out
the
inside
drawer
i
should
find
the
rolls
of
gold
there
just
as
before
alas
everything
was
empty
as
the
trust
which
had
been
betrayed
i
had
to
go
through
the
farce
of
dressing
i
had
to
do
my
hair
up
all
over
again
quite
unnecessarily
when
i
came
out
my
railed
at
me
how
many
times
are
you
going
to
dress
today
my
birthday
i
said
oh
any
pretext
seems
good
enough
she
went
on
many
vain
people
have
i
seen
in
my
day
but
you
beat
them
all
hollow
i
was
about
to
summon
a
servant
to
send
after
amulya
when
one
of
the
men
came
up
with
a
little
note
which
he
handed
to
me
it
was
from
amulya
sister
he
wrote
you
invited
me
this
afternoon
but
i
thought
i
should
not
wait
let
me
first
execute
your
bidding
and
then
come
for
my
i
may
be
a
little
late
to
whom
could
he
be
going
to
return
that
money
into
what
fresh
entanglement
was
the
poor
boy
rushing
o
miserable
woman
you
can
only
send
him
off
like
an
arrow
but
not
recall
him
if
you
miss
your
aim
i
should
have
declared
at
once
that
i
was
at
the
bottom
of
this
robbery
but
women
live
on
the
trust
of
their
surroundings
this
is
their
whole
world
if
once
it
is
out
that
this
trust
has
been
secretly
betrayed
their
place
in
their
world
is
lost
they
have
then
to
stand
upon
the
fragments
of
the
thing
they
have
broken
and
its
jagged
edges
keep
on
wounding
them
at
every
turn
to
sin
is
easy
enough
but
to
make
up
for
it
is
above
all
difficult
for
a
woman
for
some
time
past
all
easy
approaches
for
communion
with
my
husband
have
been
closed
to
me
how
then
could
i
burst
on
him
with
this
stupendous
news
he
was
very
late
in
coming
for
his
meal
today
nearly
two
he
was
and
hardly
touched
any
food
i
had
lost
even
the
right
to
press
him
to
take
a
little
more
i
had
to
avert
my
face
to
wipe
away
my
tears
i
wanted
so
badly
to
say
to
him
do
come
into
our
room
and
rest
awhile
you
look
so
tired
i
had
just
cleared
my
throat
with
a
little
cough
when
a
servant
hurried
in
to
say
that
the
police
inspector
had
brought
panchu
up
to
the
palace
my
husband
with
the
shadow
on
his
face
deepened
left
his
meal
unfinished
and
went
out
a
little
later
the
bara
rani
appeared
why
did
you
not
send
me
word
when
brother
nikhil
came
in
she
complained
as
he
was
late
i
thought
i
might
as
well
finish
my
bath
in
the
meantime
however
did
he
manage
to
get
through
his
meal
so
soon
why
did
you
want
him
for
anything
what
is
this
about
both
of
you
going
off
to
calcutta
tomorrow
all
i
can
say
is
i
am
not
going
to
be
left
here
alone
i
should
get
startled
out
of
my
life
at
every
sound
with
all
these
dacoits
about
is
it
quite
settled
about
your
going
tomorrow
yes
said
i
though
i
had
only
just
now
heard
it
and
though
moreover
i
was
not
at
all
sure
that
before
tomorrow
our
history
might
not
take
such
a
turn
as
to
make
it
all
one
whether
we
went
or
stayed
after
that
what
our
home
our
life
would
be
like
was
utterly
beyond
my
ken
it
seemed
so
misty
and
in
a
very
few
hours
now
my
unseen
fate
would
become
visible
was
there
no
one
who
could
keep
on
postponing
the
flight
of
these
hours
from
day
to
day
and
so
make
them
long
enough
for
me
to
set
things
right
so
far
as
lay
in
my
power
the
time
during
which
the
seed
lies
underground
is
long
so
long
indeed
that
one
forgets
that
there
is
any
danger
of
its
sprouting
but
once
its
shoot
shows
up
above
the
surface
it
grows
and
grows
so
fast
there
is
no
time
to
cover
it
up
neither
with
skirt
nor
body
nor
even
life
itself
i
will
try
to
think
of
it
no
more
but
sit
quiet
passive
and
callous
let
the
crash
come
when
it
may
by
the
day
after
tomorrow
all
will
be
over
publicity
laughter
bewailing
questions
explanations
everything
but
i
can
not
forget
the
face
of
amulya
beautiful
radiant
with
devotion
he
did
not
wait
despairing
for
the
blow
of
fate
to
fall
but
rushed
into
the
thick
of
danger
in
my
misery
i
do
him
reverence
he
is
my
under
the
pretext
of
his
playfulness
he
took
from
me
the
weight
of
my
burden
he
would
save
me
by
taking
the
punishment
meant
for
me
on
his
own
head
but
how
am
ito
bear
this
terrible
mercy
of
my
god
oh
my
child
my
child
i
do
you
reverence
little
brother
mine
i
do
you
reverence
pure
are
you
beautiful
are
you
i
do
you
reverence
may
you
come
to
my
arms
in
the
next
birth
as
my
own
child
that
is
my
prayer
any
dainties
to
be
offered
ceremonially
should
be
made
by
the
lady
of
the
house
herself
xxii
rumour
became
busy
on
every
side
the
police
were
continually
in
and
out
the
servants
of
the
house
were
in
a
great
flurry
khema
my
maid
came
up
to
me
and
said
oh
rani
mother
for
goodness
sake
put
away
my
gold
necklace
and
armlets
in
your
iron
safe
to
whom
was
i
to
explain
that
the
rani
herself
had
been
weaving
all
this
network
of
trouble
and
had
got
caught
in
it
too
i
had
to
play
the
benign
protector
and
take
charge
of
khema
ornaments
and
thako
savings
the
in
her
turn
brought
along
and
kept
in
my
room
a
box
in
which
were
a
benares
and
some
other
of
her
valued
possessions
i
got
these
at
your
wedding
she
told
me
when
tomorrow
my
iron
safe
will
be
opened
in
the
presence
of
these
khema
thako
the
and
all
the
rest
let
me
not
think
of
it
let
me
rather
try
to
think
what
it
will
be
like
when
this
third
day
of
magh
comes
round
again
after
a
year
has
passed
will
all
the
wounds
of
my
home
life
then
be
still
as
fresh
as
ever
amulya
writes
that
he
will
come
later
in
the
evening
i
can
not
remain
alone
with
my
thoughts
doing
nothing
so
i
sit
down
again
to
make
cakes
for
him
i
have
finished
making
quite
a
quantity
but
still
i
must
go
on
who
will
eat
them
i
shall
distribute
them
amongst
the
servants
i
must
do
so
this
very
night
tonight
is
my
limit
tomorrow
will
not
be
in
my
hands
i
went
on
untiringly
frying
cake
after
cake
every
now
and
then
it
seemed
to
me
that
there
was
some
noise
in
the
direction
of
my
rooms
upstairs
could
it
be
that
my
husband
had
missed
the
key
of
the
safe
and
the
bara
rani
had
assembled
all
the
servants
to
help
him
to
hunt
for
it
no
i
must
not
pay
heed
to
these
sounds
let
me
shut
the
door
i
rose
to
do
so
when
thako
came
panting
in
rani
mother
oh
rani
mother
oh
get
away
i
snapped
out
cutting
her
short
do
come
bothering
me
the
bara
rani
mother
wants
you
she
went
on
her
nephew
has
brought
such
a
wonderful
machine
from
calcutta
it
talks
like
a
man
do
come
and
hear
it
i
did
not
know
whether
to
laugh
or
to
cry
so
of
all
things
a
gramophone
needs
must
come
on
the
scene
at
such
a
time
repeating
at
every
winding
the
nasal
twang
of
its
theatrical
songs
what
a
fearsome
thing
results
when
a
machine
apes
a
man
the
shades
of
evening
began
to
fall
i
knew
that
amulya
would
not
delay
to
announce
himself
yet
i
could
not
wait
i
summone
d
a
servant
and
said
go
and
tell
amulya
babu
to
come
straight
in
here
the
man
came
back
after
a
while
to
say
that
amulya
was
not
in
he
had
not
come
back
since
he
had
gone
gone
the
last
word
struck
my
ears
like
a
wail
in
the
gathering
darkness
amulya
gone
had
he
then
come
like
a
streak
of
light
from
the
setting
sun
only
to
be
gone
for
ever
all
kinds
of
possible
and
impossible
dangers
flitted
through
my
mind
it
was
i
who
had
sent
him
to
his
death
what
if
he
was
fearless
that
only
showed
his
own
greatness
of
heart
but
after
this
how
was
ito
go
on
living
all
by
myself
i
had
no
memento
of
amulya
save
that
pistol
his
offering
it
seemed
to
me
that
this
was
a
sign
given
by
providence
this
guilt
which
had
contaminated
my
life
at
its
very
root
my
god
in
the
form
of
a
child
had
left
with
me
the
means
of
wiping
it
away
and
then
vanished
oh
the
loving
gift
the
saving
grave
that
lay
hidden
within
it
i
opened
my
box
and
took
out
the
pistol
lifting
it
reverently
to
my
forehead
at
that
moment
the
gongs
clanged
out
from
the
temple
attached
to
our
house
i
prostrated
myself
in
salutation
in
the
evening
i
feasted
the
whole
household
with
my
cakes
you
have
managed
a
wonderful
birthday
feast
and
all
by
yourself
too
exclaimed
my
but
you
must
leave
something
for
us
to
do
with
this
she
turned
on
her
gramophone
and
let
loose
the
shrill
treble
of
the
calcutta
actresses
all
over
the
place
it
seemed
like
a
stable
full
of
neighing
fillies
it
got
quite
late
before
the
feasting
was
over
i
had
a
sudden
longing
to
end
my
birthday
celebration
by
taking
the
dust
of
my
husband
feet
i
went
up
to
the
bedroom
and
found
him
fast
asleep
he
had
had
such
a
worrying
trying
day
i
raised
the
edge
of
the
mosquito
curtain
very
very
gently
and
laid
my
head
near
his
feet
my
hair
must
have
touched
him
for
he
moved
his
legs
in
his
sleep
and
pushed
my
head
away
i
then
went
out
and
sat
in
the
west
verandah
a
tree
which
had
shed
all
its
leaves
stood
there
in
the
distance
like
a
skeleton
behind
it
the
crescent
moon
was
setting
all
of
a
sudden
i
had
the
feeling
that
the
very
stars
in
the
sky
were
afraid
of
me
that
the
whole
of
the
night
world
was
looking
askance
at
me
why
because
i
was
alone
there
is
nothing
so
strange
in
creation
as
the
man
who
is
alone
even
he
whose
near
ones
have
all
died
one
by
one
is
not
alone
companionship
comes
for
him
from
behind
the
screen
of
death
but
he
whose
kin
are
there
yet
no
longer
near
who
has
dropped
out
of
all
the
varied
companionship
of
a
full
home
the
starry
universe
itself
seems
to
bristle
to
look
on
him
in
his
darkness
where
i
am
i
am
not
i
am
far
away
from
those
who
are
around
me
i
live
and
move
upon
a
chasm
of
separation
unstable
as
the
upon
the
lotus
leaf
why
do
not
men
change
wholly
when
they
change
when
i
look
into
my
heart
i
find
everything
that
was
there
still
there
only
they
are
things
that
were
have
become
jumbled
up
the
gems
that
were
strung
into
a
necklace
are
now
rolling
in
the
dust
and
so
my
heart
is
breaking
i
feel
i
want
to
die
yet
in
my
heart
everything
still
lives
nor
even
in
death
can
i
see
the
end
of
it
all
rather
in
death
there
seems
to
be
ever
so
much
more
of
repining
what
is
to
be
ended
must
be
ended
in
this
life
there
is
no
other
way
out
oh
forgive
me
just
once
only
this
time
lord
all
that
you
gave
into
my
hands
as
the
wealth
of
my
life
i
have
made
into
my
burden
i
can
neither
bear
it
longer
nor
give
it
up
o
lord
sound
once
again
those
flute
strains
which
you
played
for
me
long
ago
standing
at
the
rosy
edge
of
my
morning
sky
and
let
all
my
complexities
become
simple
and
easy
nothing
save
the
music
of
your
flute
can
make
whole
that
which
has
been
broken
and
pure
that
which
has
been
sullied
create
my
home
anew
with
your
music
no
other
way
can
i
see
i
threw
myself
prone
on
the
ground
and
sobbed
aloud
it
was
for
mercy
that
i
prayed
some
little
mercy
from
somewhere
some
shelter
some
sign
of
forgiveness
some
hope
that
might
bring
about
the
end
lord
i
vowed
to
myself
i
will
lie
here
waiting
and
waiting
touching
neither
food
nor
drink
so
long
as
your
blessing
does
not
reach
me
i
heard
the
sound
of
footsteps
who
says
that
the
gods
do
not
show
themselves
to
mortal
men
i
did
not
raise
my
face
to
look
up
lest
the
sight
of
it
should
break
the
spell
come
oh
come
come
and
let
your
feet
touch
my
head
come
lord
and
set
your
foot
upon
my
throbbing
heart
and
at
that
moment
let
me
die
he
came
and
sat
near
my
head
who
my
husband
at
the
first
touch
of
his
presence
i
felt
that
i
should
swoon
and
then
the
pain
at
my
heart
burst
its
way
out
in
an
overwhelming
flood
of
tears
tearing
through
all
my
obstructing
veins
and
nerves
i
strained
his
feet
to
my
bosom
oh
why
could
not
their
impress
remain
there
for
ever
he
tenderly
stroked
my
head
i
received
his
blessing
now
i
shall
be
able
to
take
up
the
penalty
of
public
humiliation
which
will
be
mine
tomorrow
and
offer
it
in
all
sincerity
at
the
feet
of
my
god
but
what
keeps
crushing
my
heart
is
the
thought
that
the
festive
flutes
which
were
played
at
my
wedding
nine
years
ago
welcoming
me
to
this
house
will
never
sound
for
me
again
in
this
life
what
rigour
of
penance
is
there
which
can
serve
to
bring
me
once
more
as
a
bride
adorned
for
her
husband
to
my
place
upon
that
same
bridal
seat
how
many
years
how
many
ages
aeons
must
pass
before
i
can
find
my
way
back
to
that
day
of
nine
years
ago
god
can
create
new
things
but
has
even
he
the
power
to
create
afresh
that
which
has
been
destroyed

today
we
are
going
to
calcutta
our
joys
and
sorrows
lie
heavy
on
us
if
we
merely
go
on
accumulating
them
keeping
them
and
accumulating
them
alike
are
false
as
master
of
the
house
i
am
in
an
artificial
position
in
reality
i
am
a
wayfarer
on
the
path
of
life
that
is
why
the
true
master
of
the
house
gets
hurt
at
every
step
and
at
last
there
comes
the
supreme
hurt
of
death
my
union
with
you
my
love
was
only
of
the
wayside
it
was
well
enough
so
long
as
we
followed
the
same
road
it
will
only
hamper
us
if
we
try
to
preserve
it
further
we
are
now
leaving
its
bonds
behind
we
are
started
on
our
journey
beyond
and
it
will
be
enough
if
we
can
throw
each
other
a
glance
or
feel
the
touch
of
each
other
hands
in
passing
after
that
after
that
there
is
the
larger
the
endless
current
of
universal
life
how
little
can
you
deprive
me
of
my
love
after
all
whenever
i
set
my
ear
to
it
i
can
hear
the
flute
which
is
playing
its
fountain
of
melody
gushing
forth
from
the
of
separation
the
immortal
draught
of
the
goddess
is
never
exhausted
she
sometimes
breaks
the
bowl
from
which
we
drink
it
only
to
smile
at
seeing
us
so
disconsolate
over
the
trifling
loss
i
will
not
stop
to
pick
up
my
broken
bowl
i
will
march
forward
albeit
with
unsatisfied
heart
the
bara
rani
came
and
asked
me
what
is
the
meaning
brother
of
all
these
books
being
packed
up
and
sent
off
in
it
only
means
i
replied
that
i
have
not
yet
been
able
to
get
over
my
fondness
for
them
i
only
wish
you
would
keep
your
fondness
for
some
other
things
as
well
do
you
mean
you
are
never
coming
back
home
i
shall
be
coming
and
going
but
shall
not
immure
myself
here
any
more
oh
indeed
then
just
come
along
to
my
room
and
see
how
many
things
have
been
unable
to
shake
off
fondness
for
with
this
she
took
me
by
the
hand
and
marched
me
off
in
my
rooms
i
found
numberless
boxes
and
bundles
ready
packed
she
opened
one
of
the
boxes
and
said
see
brother
look
at
all
my
things
in
this
bottle
i
have
catechu
powder
scented
with
the
pollen
of
blossoms
these
little
tin
boxes
are
all
for
different
kinds
of
spices
i
have
not
forgotten
my
playing
cards
and
either
if
you
two
are
i
shall
manage
to
make
other
friends
there
who
will
give
me
a
game
do
you
remember
this
comb
it
was
one
of
the
combs
you
brought
for
me
but
what
is
all
this
for
sister
rani
why
have
you
been
packing
up
all
these
things
do
you
think
i
am
not
going
with
you
what
an
extraordinary
idea
do
you
be
afraid
i
am
not
going
there
to
flirt
with
you
nor
to
quarrel
with
the
chota
rani
one
must
die
sooner
or
later
and
it
is
just
as
well
to
be
on
the
bank
of
the
holy
ganges
before
it
is
too
late
it
is
too
horrible
to
think
of
being
cremated
in
your
wretched
here
under
that
stumpy
banian
tree
that
is
why
i
have
been
refusing
to
die
and
have
plagued
you
all
this
time
at
last
i
could
hear
the
true
voice
of
home
the
bara
rani
came
into
our
house
as
its
bride
when
i
was
only
six
years
old
we
have
played
together
through
the
drowsy
afternoons
in
a
corner
of
the
i
have
thrown
down
to
her
green
amras
from
the
to
be
made
into
deliciously
indigestible
chutnies
by
slicing
them
up
with
mustard
salt
and
fragrant
herbs
it
was
my
part
to
gather
for
her
all
the
forbidden
things
from
the
to
be
used
in
the
marriage
celebration
of
her
doll
for
in
the
penal
code
of
my
grandmother
i
alone
was
exempt
from
punishment
and
i
used
to
be
appointed
her
messenger
to
my
brother
whenever
she
wanted
to
coax
something
special
out
of
him
because
he
could
not
resist
my
importunity
i
also
remember
how
when
i
suffered
under
the
rigorous
régime
of
the
doctors
of
those
days
who
would
not
allow
anything
except
warm
water
and
sugared
cardamom
seeds
during
feverish
attacks
my
could
not
bear
my
privation
and
used
to
bring
me
delicacies
on
the
sly
what
a
scolding
she
got
one
day
when
she
was
caught
and
then
as
we
grew
up
our
mutual
joys
and
sorrows
took
on
deeper
tones
of
intimacy
how
we
quarrelled
sometimes
conflicts
of
worldly
interests
roused
suspicions
and
jealousies
making
breaches
in
our
love
and
when
the
chota
rani
came
in
between
us
these
breaches
seemed
as
if
they
would
never
be
mended
but
it
always
turned
out
that
the
healing
forces
at
bottom
proved
more
powerful
than
the
wounds
on
the
surface
so
has
a
true
relationship
grown
up
between
us
from
our
childhood
up
till
now
and
its
branching
foliage
has
spread
and
broadened
over
every
room
and
verandah
and
terrace
of
this
great
house
when
i
saw
the
bara
rani
make
ready
with
all
her
belongings
to
depart
from
this
house
of
ours
all
the
ties
that
bound
us
to
their
ends
felt
the
shock
the
reason
was
clear
to
me
why
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
drift
away
towards
the
unknown
cutting
asunder
all
her
lifelong
bonds
of
daily
habit
and
of
the
house
itself
which
she
had
never
left
for
a
day
since
she
first
entered
it
at
the
age
of
nine
and
yet
it
was
this
real
reason
which
she
could
not
allow
to
escape
her
lips
preferring
rather
to
put
forward
any
other
paltry
excuse
she
had
only
this
one
relationship
left
in
all
the
world
and
the
poor
unfortunate
widowed
and
childless
woman
had
cherished
it
with
all
the
tenderness
hoarded
in
her
heart
how
deeply
she
had
felt
our
proposed
separation
i
never
realized
so
keenly
as
when
i
stood
amongst
her
scattered
boxes
and
bundles
i
could
see
at
once
that
the
little
differences
she
used
to
have
with
bimala
about
money
matters
did
not
proceed
from
any
sordid
worldliness
but
because
she
felt
that
her
claims
in
regard
to
this
one
relationship
of
her
life
had
been
overridden
and
its
ties
weakened
for
her
by
the
coming
in
between
of
this
other
woman
from
goodness
knows
where
she
had
been
hurt
at
every
turn
and
yet
had
not
the
right
to
complain
and
bimala
she
also
had
felt
that
the
senior
rani
claim
over
me
was
not
based
merely
on
our
social
connection
but
went
much
deeper
and
she
was
jealous
of
these
ties
between
us
reaching
back
to
our
childhood
today
my
heart
knocked
heavily
against
the
doors
of
my
breast
i
sank
down
upon
one
of
the
boxes
as
i
said
how
i
should
love
sister
rani
to
go
back
to
the
days
when
we
first
met
in
this
old
house
of
ours
no
brother
dear
she
replied
with
a
sigh
i
would
not
live
my
life
again
not
as
a
woman
let
what
i
have
had
to
bear
end
with
this
one
birth
i
could
not
bear
it
over
again
i
said
to
her
the
freedom
to
which
we
pass
through
sorrow
is
greater
than
the
sorrow
that
may
be
so
for
you
men
freedom
is
for
you
but
we
women
would
keep
others
bound
we
would
rather
be
put
into
bondage
ourselves
no
no
brother
you
will
never
get
free
from
our
toils
if
you
needs
must
spread
your
wings
you
will
have
to
take
us
with
you
we
refuse
to
be
left
behind
that
is
why
i
have
gathered
together
all
this
weight
of
luggage
it
would
never
do
to
allow
men
to
run
too
light
i
can
feel
the
weight
of
your
words
i
said
laughing
and
if
we
men
do
not
complain
of
your
burdens
it
is
because
women
pay
us
so
handsomely
for
what
they
make
us
carry
you
carry
it
she
said
because
it
is
made
up
of
many
small
things
whichever
one
you
think
of
rejecting
pleads
that
it
is
so
light
and
so
with
much
lightness
we
weigh
you
down
when
do
we
start
the
train
leaves
at
half
past
eleven
tonight
there
will
be
lots
of
time
look
here
do
be
good
for
once
and
listen
to
just
one
word
of
mine
take
a
good
nap
this
afternoon
you
know
you
never
get
any
sleep
in
the
train
you
look
so
pulled
down
you
might
go
to
pieces
any
moment
come
along
get
through
your
bath
first
as
we
went
towards
my
room
khema
the
maid
came
up
and
with
an
pull
at
her
veil
told
us
in
deprecatingly
low
tones
that
the
police
inspector
had
arrived
with
a
prisoner
and
wanted
to
see
the
maharaja
is
the
maharaja
a
thief
or
a
robber
the
bara
rani
flared
up
that
he
should
be
set
upon
so
by
the
police
go
and
tell
the
inspector
that
the
maharaja
is
at
his
bath
let
me
just
go
and
see
what
is
the
matter
i
pleaded
it
may
be
something
urgent
no
no
my
insisted
our
chota
rani
was
making
a
heap
of
cakes
last
night
i
send
some
to
the
inspector
to
keep
him
quiet
till
you
ready
with
this
she
pushed
me
into
my
room
and
shut
the
door
on
me
i
had
not
the
power
to
resist
such
tyranny
so
rare
is
it
in
this
world
let
the
inspector
while
away
the
time
eating
cakes
what
if
business
is
a
bit
neglected
the
police
had
been
in
great
form
these
last
few
days
arresting
now
this
one
now
that
each
day
some
innocent
person
or
other
would
be
brought
along
to
enliven
the
assembly
in
my
one
more
such
unfortunate
i
supposed
must
have
been
brought
in
that
day
but
why
should
the
inspector
alone
be
regaled
with
cakes
that
would
not
do
at
all
i
thumped
vigorously
on
the
door
if
you
are
going
mad
be
quick
and
pour
some
water
over
your
head
that
will
keep
you
cool
said
my
from
the
passage
send
down
cakes
for
two
i
shouted
the
person
who
has
been
brought
in
as
the
thief
probably
deserves
them
better
tell
the
man
to
give
him
a
good
big
helping
i
hurried
through
my
bath
when
i
came
out
i
found
bimal
sitting
on
the
floor
outside
could
this
be
my
bimal
of
old
my
proud
sensitive
bimal
what
favour
could
she
be
wanting
to
beg
seated
like
this
at
my
door
as
i
stopped
short
she
stood
up
and
said
gently
with
downcast
eyes
i
would
have
a
word
with
you
come
inside
then
i
said
but
are
you
going
out
on
any
particular
business
i
was
but
let
that
be
i
want
to
hear
no
finish
your
business
first
we
will
have
our
talk
after
you
have
had
your
dinner
i
went
off
to
my
to
find
the
police
plate
quite
empty
the
person
he
had
brought
with
him
however
was
still
busy
eating
hullo
i
ejaculated
in
surprise
you
amulya
it
is
i
sir
said
amulya
with
his
mouth
full
of
cake
had
quite
a
feast
and
if
you
do
mind
i
take
the
rest
with
me
with
this
he
proceeded
to
tie
up
the
remaining
cakes
in
his
handkerchief
what
does
this
mean
i
asked
staring
at
the
inspector
the
man
laughed
we
are
no
nearer
sir
he
said
to
solving
the
problem
of
the
thief
meanwhile
the
mystery
of
the
theft
deepens
he
then
produced
something
tied
up
in
a
rag
which
when
untied
disclosed
a
bundle
of
currency
notes
this
maharaja
said
the
inspector
is
your
six
thousand
rupees
where
was
it
found
in
amulya
babu
hands
he
went
last
evening
to
the
manager
of
your
chakna
to
tell
him
that
the
money
had
been
found
the
manager
seemed
to
be
in
a
greater
state
of
trepidation
at
the
recovery
than
he
had
been
at
the
robbery
he
was
afraid
he
would
be
suspected
of
having
made
away
with
the
notes
and
of
now
making
up
a
story
for
fear
of
being
found
out
he
asked
amulya
to
wait
on
the
pretext
of
getting
him
some
refreshment
and
came
straight
over
to
the
police
office
i
rode
off
at
once
kept
amulya
with
me
and
have
been
busy
with
him
the
whole
morning
he
refuses
to
tell
us
where
he
got
the
money
from
i
warned
him
he
would
be
kept
under
restraint
till
he
did
so
in
that
case
he
informed
me
he
would
have
to
lie
very
well
i
said
he
might
do
so
if
he
pleased
then
he
stated
that
he
had
found
the
money
under
a
bush
i
pointed
out
to
him
that
it
was
not
quite
so
easy
to
lie
as
all
that
under
what
bush
where
was
the
place
why
was
he
there
all
this
would
have
to
be
stated
as
well
you
worry
he
said
is
plenty
of
time
to
invent
all
that
but
inspector
i
said
why
are
you
badgering
a
respectable
young
gentleman
like
amulya
babu
i
have
no
desire
to
harass
him
said
the
inspector
he
is
not
only
a
gentleman
but
the
son
of
nibaran
babu
my
let
me
tell
you
maharaja
exactly
what
must
have
happened
amulya
knows
the
thief
but
wants
to
shield
him
by
drawing
suspicion
on
himself
that
is
just
the
sort
of
bravado
he
loves
to
indulge
in
the
inspector
turned
to
amulya
look
here
young
man
he
continued
i
also
was
eighteen
once
upon
a
time
and
a
student
in
the
ripon
college
i
nearly
got
into
gaol
trying
to
rescue
a
hack
driver
from
a
police
constable
it
was
a
near
shave
then
he
turned
again
to
me
and
said
maharaja
the
real
thief
will
now
probably
escape
but
i
think
i
can
tell
you
who
is
at
the
bottom
of
it
all
who
is
it
then
i
asked
the
manager
in
collusion
with
the
guard
kasim
when
the
inspector
having
argued
out
his
theory
to
his
own
satisfaction
at
last
departed
i
said
to
amulya
if
you
will
tell
me
who
took
the
money
i
promise
you
no
one
shall
be
hurt
i
did
said
he
but
how
can
that
be
what
about
the
gang
of
armed
men
it
was
i
by
myself
alone
what
amulya
then
told
me
was
indeed
extraordinary
the
manager
had
just
finished
his
supper
and
was
on
the
verandah
rinsing
out
his
mouth
the
place
was
somewhat
dark
amulya
had
a
revolver
in
each
pocket
one
loaded
with
blank
cartridges
the
other
with
ball
he
had
a
mask
over
his
face
he
flashed
a
lantern
in
the
manager
face
and
fired
a
blank
shot
the
man
swooned
away
some
of
the
guards
who
were
off
duty
came
running
up
but
when
amulya
fired
another
blank
shot
at
them
they
lost
no
time
in
taking
cover
then
kasim
who
was
on
duty
came
up
whirling
a
quarterstaff
this
time
amulya
aimed
a
bullet
at
his
legs
and
finding
himself
hit
kasim
collapsed
on
the
floor
amulya
then
made
the
trembling
manager
who
had
come
to
his
senses
open
the
safe
and
deliver
up
six
thousand
rupees
finally
he
took
one
of
the
estate
horses
and
galloped
off
a
few
miles
there
let
the
animal
loose
and
quietly
walked
up
here
to
our
place
what
made
you
do
all
this
amulya
i
asked
there
was
a
grave
reason
maharaja
he
replied
but
why
then
did
you
try
to
return
the
money
let
her
come
at
whose
command
i
did
so
in
her
presence
i
shall
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
and
who
may
be
my
sister
the
chota
rani
i
sent
for
bimala
she
came
hesitatingly
barefoot
with
a
white
shawl
over
her
head
i
had
never
seen
my
bimal
like
this
before
she
seemed
to
have
wrapped
herself
in
a
morning
light
amulya
prostrated
himself
in
salutation
and
took
the
dust
of
her
feet
then
as
he
rose
he
said
your
command
has
been
executed
sister
the
money
is
returned
you
have
saved
me
my
little
brother
said
bimal
with
your
image
in
my
mind
i
have
not
uttered
a
single
lie
amulya
continued
my
watchword
has
been
cast
away
at
your
feet
for
good
i
have
also
received
my
reward
your
as
soon
as
i
came
to
the
palace
bimal
looked
at
him
blankly
unable
to
follow
his
last
words
amulya
brought
out
his
handkerchief
and
untying
it
showed
her
the
cakes
put
away
inside
i
did
not
eat
them
all
he
said
i
have
kept
these
to
eat
after
you
have
helped
me
with
your
own
hands
i
could
see
that
i
was
not
wanted
here
i
went
out
of
the
room
i
could
only
preach
and
preach
so
i
mused
and
get
my
effigy
burnt
for
my
pains
i
had
not
yet
been
able
to
bring
back
a
single
soul
from
the
path
of
death
they
who
have
the
power
can
do
so
by
a
mere
sign
my
words
have
not
that
ineffable
meaning
i
am
not
a
flame
only
a
black
coal
which
has
gone
out
i
can
light
no
lamp
that
is
what
the
story
of
my
life
shows
my
row
of
lamps
has
remained
unlit
sitting
on
the
bare
floor
is
a
sign
of
mourning
and
so
by
association
of
ideas
of
an
abject
attitude
of
mind
xvi
i
returned
slowly
towards
the
inner
apartments
the
bara
room
must
have
been
drawing
me
again
it
had
become
an
absolute
necessity
for
me
that
day
to
feel
that
this
life
of
mine
had
been
able
to
strike
some
real
some
responsive
chord
in
some
other
harp
of
life
one
can
not
realize
one
own
existence
by
remaining
within
oneself
it
has
to
be
sought
outside
as
i
passed
in
front
of
my
room
she
came
out
saying
i
was
afraid
you
would
be
late
again
this
afternoon
however
i
ordered
your
dinner
as
soon
as
i
heard
you
coming
it
will
be
served
in
a
minute
meanwhile
i
said
let
me
take
out
that
money
of
yours
and
have
it
kept
ready
to
take
with
us
as
we
walked
on
towards
my
room
she
asked
me
if
the
police
inspector
had
made
any
report
about
the
robbery
i
somehow
did
not
feel
inclined
to
tell
her
all
the
details
of
how
that
six
thousand
had
come
back
that
just
what
all
the
fuss
is
about
i
said
evasively
when
i
went
into
my
and
took
out
my
bunch
of
keys
i
did
not
find
the
key
of
the
iron
safe
on
the
ring
what
an
absurdly
fellow
i
was
to
be
sure
only
this
morning
i
had
been
opening
so
many
boxes
and
things
and
never
noticed
that
this
key
was
not
there
what
has
happened
to
your
key
she
asked
me
i
went
on
fumbling
in
this
pocket
and
that
but
could
give
her
no
answer
i
hunted
in
the
same
place
over
and
over
again
it
dawned
on
both
of
us
that
it
could
not
be
a
case
of
the
key
being
mislaid
someone
must
have
taken
it
off
the
ring
who
could
it
be
who
else
could
have
come
into
this
room
do
you
worry
about
it
she
said
to
me
get
through
your
dinner
first
the
chota
rani
must
have
kept
it
herself
seeing
how
you
are
getting
i
was
however
greatly
disturbed
it
was
never
bimal
habit
to
take
any
key
of
mine
without
telling
me
about
it
bimal
was
not
present
at
my
that
day
she
was
busy
feasting
amulya
in
her
own
room
my
wanted
to
send
for
her
but
i
asked
her
not
to
do
so
i
had
just
finished
my
dinner
when
bimal
came
in
i
would
have
preferred
not
to
discuss
the
matter
of
the
key
in
the
bara
presence
but
as
soon
as
she
saw
bimal
she
asked
her
do
you
know
dear
where
the
key
of
the
safe
is
i
have
it
was
the
reply
did
i
say
so
exclaimed
my
triumphantly
our
chota
rani
pretends
not
to
care
about
these
robberies
but
she
takes
precautions
on
the
sly
all
the
same
the
look
on
bimal
face
made
my
mind
misgive
me
let
the
key
be
now
i
said
i
will
take
out
that
money
in
the
evening
there
you
go
again
putting
it
off
said
the
bara
rani
why
not
take
it
out
and
send
it
to
the
treasury
while
you
have
it
in
mind
i
have
taken
it
out
already
said
bimal
i
was
startled
where
have
you
kept
it
then
asked
my
i
have
spent
it
just
listen
to
her
whatever
did
you
spend
all
that
money
on
bimal
made
no
reply
i
asked
her
nothing
further
the
bara
rani
seemed
about
to
make
some
further
remark
to
bimala
but
checked
herself
well
that
is
all
right
anyway
she
said
at
length
as
she
looked
towards
me
just
what
i
used
to
do
with
my
husband
loose
cash
i
knew
it
was
no
use
leaving
it
with
him
his
hundred
and
one
would
be
sure
to
get
hold
of
it
you
are
much
the
same
dear
what
a
number
of
ways
you
men
know
of
getting
through
money
we
can
only
save
it
from
you
by
stealing
it
ourselves
come
along
now
off
with
you
to
bed
the
bara
rani
led
me
to
my
room
but
i
hardly
knew
where
i
was
going
she
sat
by
my
bed
after
i
was
stretched
on
it
and
smiled
at
bimal
as
she
said
give
me
one
of
your
pans
chotie
darling
what
you
have
none
you
have
become
a
regular
then
send
for
some
from
my
room
but
have
you
had
your
dinner
yet
i
anxiously
enquired
oh
long
ago
she
replied
clearly
a
fib
she
kept
on
chattering
away
there
at
my
bedside
on
all
manner
of
things
the
maid
came
and
told
bimal
that
her
dinner
had
been
served
and
was
getting
cold
but
she
gave
no
sign
of
having
heard
it
not
had
your
dinner
yet
what
nonsense
it
fearfully
late
with
this
the
bara
rani
took
bimal
away
with
her
i
could
divine
that
there
was
some
connection
between
the
taking
out
of
this
six
thousand
and
the
robbing
of
the
other
but
i
have
no
curiosity
to
learn
the
nature
of
it
i
shall
never
ask
providence
leaves
our
life
moulded
in
the
rough
its
object
being
that
we
ourselves
should
put
the
finishing
touches
shaping
it
into
its
final
form
to
our
taste
there
has
always
been
the
hankering
within
me
to
express
some
great
idea
in
the
process
of
giving
shape
to
my
life
on
the
lines
suggested
by
the
creator
in
this
endeavour
i
have
spent
all
my
days
how
severely
i
have
curbed
my
desires
repressed
myself
at
every
step
only
the
searcher
of
the
heart
knows
but
the
difficulty
is
that
one
life
is
not
solely
one
own
he
who
would
create
it
must
do
so
with
the
help
of
his
surroundings
or
he
will
fail
so
it
was
my
constant
dream
to
draw
bimal
to
join
me
in
this
work
of
creating
myself
i
loved
her
with
all
my
soul
on
the
strength
of
that
i
could
not
but
succeed
in
winning
her
to
my
purpose
that
was
my
firm
belief
then
i
discovered
that
those
who
could
simply
and
naturally
draw
their
environment
into
the
process
of
their
belonged
to
one
species
of
the
genus
man
and
i
to
another
i
had
received
the
vital
spark
but
could
not
impart
it
those
to
whom
i
have
surrendered
my
all
have
taken
my
all
but
not
myself
with
it
my
trial
is
hard
indeed
just
when
i
want
a
helpmate
most
i
am
thrown
back
on
myself
alone
nevertheless
i
record
my
vow
that
even
in
this
trial
i
shall
win
through
alone
then
shall
i
tread
my
thorny
path
to
the
end
of
this
life
journey
i
have
begun
to
suspect
that
there
has
all
along
been
a
vein
of
tyranny
in
me
there
was
a
despotism
in
my
desire
to
mould
my
relations
with
bimala
in
a
hard
perfect
form
but
man
life
was
not
meant
to
be
cast
in
a
mould
and
if
we
try
to
shape
the
good
as
so
much
mere
material
it
takes
a
terrible
revenge
by
losing
its
life
i
did
not
realize
all
this
while
that
it
must
have
been
this
unconscious
tyranny
of
mine
which
made
us
gradually
drift
apart
bimala
life
not
finding
its
true
level
by
reason
of
my
pressure
from
above
has
had
to
find
an
outlet
by
undermining
its
banks
at
the
bottom
she
has
had
to
steal
this
six
thousand
rupees
because
she
could
not
be
open
with
me
because
she
felt
that
in
certain
things
i
despotically
differed
from
her
men
such
as
i
possessed
with
one
idea
are
indeed
at
one
with
those
who
can
manage
to
agree
with
us
but
those
who
do
not
can
only
get
on
with
us
by
cheating
us
it
is
our
unyielding
obstinacy
which
drives
even
the
simplest
to
tortuous
ways
in
trying
to
manufacture
a
helpmate
we
spoil
a
wife
could
i
not
go
back
to
the
beginning
then
indeed
i
should
follow
the
path
of
the
simple
i
should
not
try
to
fetter
my
life
companion
with
my
ideas
but
play
the
joyous
pipes
of
my
love
and
say
do
you
love
me
then
may
you
grow
true
to
yourself
in
the
light
of
your
love
let
my
suggestions
be
suppressed
let
god
design
which
is
in
you
triumph
and
my
ideas
retire
abashed
but
can
even
nature
nursing
heal
the
open
wound
into
which
our
accumulated
differences
have
broken
out
the
covering
veil
beneath
the
privacy
of
which
nature
silent
forces
alone
can
work
has
been
torn
asunder
wounds
must
be
bandaged
can
we
not
bandage
our
wound
with
our
love
so
that
the
day
may
come
when
its
scar
will
no
longer
be
visible
it
is
not
too
late
so
much
time
has
been
lost
in
misunderstanding
it
has
taken
right
up
to
now
to
come
to
an
understanding
how
much
more
time
will
it
take
for
the
correcting
what
if
the
wound
does
eventually
heal
can
the
devastation
it
has
wrought
ever
be
made
good
there
was
a
slight
sound
near
the
door
as
i
turned
over
i
saw
bimala
retreating
figure
through
the
open
doorway
she
must
have
been
waiting
by
the
door
hesitating
whether
to
come
in
or
not
and
at
last
have
decided
to
go
back
i
jumped
up
and
bounded
to
the
door
calling
bimal
she
stopped
on
her
way
she
had
her
back
to
me
i
went
and
took
her
by
the
hand
and
led
her
into
our
room
she
threw
herself
face
downwards
on
a
pillow
and
sobbed
and
sobbed
i
said
nothing
but
held
her
hand
as
i
sat
by
her
head
when
her
storm
of
grief
had
abated
she
sat
up
i
tried
to
draw
her
to
my
breast
but
she
pushed
my
arms
away
and
knelt
at
my
feet
touching
them
repeatedly
with
her
head
in
obeisance
i
hastily
drew
my
feet
back
but
she
clasped
them
in
her
arms
saying
in
a
choking
voice
no
no
no
you
must
not
take
away
your
feet
let
me
do
my
worship
i
kept
still
who
was
i
to
stop
her
was
i
the
god
of
her
worship
that
i
should
have
any
qualms
bimala
story
xxiii
come
come
now
is
the
time
to
set
sail
towards
that
great
confluence
where
the
river
of
love
meets
the
sea
of
worship
in
that
pure
blue
all
the
weight
of
its
muddiness
sinks
and
disappears
i
now
fear
nothing
neither
myself
nor
anybody
else
i
have
passed
through
fire
what
was
inflammable
has
been
burnt
to
ashes
what
is
left
is
deathless
i
have
dedicated
myself
to
the
feet
of
him
who
has
received
all
my
sin
into
the
depths
of
his
own
pain
tonight
we
go
to
calcutta
my
inward
troubles
have
so
long
prevented
my
looking
after
my
things
now
let
me
arrange
and
pack
them
after
a
while
i
found
my
husband
had
come
in
and
was
taking
a
hand
in
the
packing
this
wo
do
i
said
did
you
not
promise
me
you
would
have
a
sleep
i
might
have
made
the
promise
he
replied
but
my
sleep
did
not
and
it
was
nowhere
to
be
found
no
no
i
repeated
this
will
never
do
lie
down
for
a
while
at
least
but
how
can
you
get
through
all
this
alone
of
course
i
can
well
you
may
boast
of
being
able
to
do
without
me
but
frankly
i
ca
do
without
you
even
sleep
refused
to
come
to
me
alone
in
that
room
then
he
set
to
work
again
but
there
was
an
interruption
in
the
shape
of
a
servant
who
came
and
said
that
sandip
babu
had
called
and
had
asked
to
be
announced
i
did
not
dare
to
ask
whom
he
wanted
the
light
of
the
sky
seemed
suddenly
to
be
shut
down
like
the
leaves
of
a
sensitive
plant
come
bimal
said
my
husband
let
us
go
and
hear
what
sandip
has
to
tell
us
since
he
has
come
back
again
after
taking
his
leave
he
must
have
something
special
to
say
i
went
simply
because
it
would
have
been
still
more
embarrassing
to
stay
sandip
was
staring
at
a
picture
on
the
wall
as
we
entered
he
said
you
must
be
wondering
why
the
fellow
has
returned
but
you
know
the
ghost
is
never
laid
till
all
the
rites
are
complete
with
these
words
he
brought
out
of
his
pocket
something
tied
in
his
handkerchief
and
laying
it
on
the
table
undid
the
knot
it
was
those
sovereigns
do
you
mistake
me
nikhil
he
said
you
must
not
imagine
that
the
contagion
of
your
company
has
suddenly
turned
me
honest
i
am
not
the
man
to
come
back
in
slobbering
repentance
to
return
money
but
he
left
his
speech
unfinished
after
a
pause
he
turned
towards
nikhil
but
said
to
me
after
all
these
days
queen
bee
the
ghost
of
compunction
has
found
an
entry
into
my
hitherto
untroubled
conscience
as
i
have
to
wrestle
with
it
every
night
after
my
first
sleep
is
over
i
can
not
call
it
a
phantom
of
my
imagination
there
is
no
escape
even
for
me
till
its
debt
is
paid
into
the
hands
of
that
spirit
therefore
let
me
make
restitution
goddess
from
you
alone
of
all
the
world
i
shall
not
be
able
to
take
away
anything
i
shall
not
be
rid
of
you
till
i
am
destitute
take
these
back
he
took
out
at
the
same
time
the
from
under
his
tunic
and
put
it
down
and
then
left
us
with
hasty
steps
listen
to
me
sandip
my
husband
called
after
him
i
have
not
the
time
nikhil
said
sandip
as
he
paused
near
the
door
the
mussulmans
i
am
told
have
taken
me
for
an
invaluable
gem
and
are
conspiring
to
loot
me
and
hide
me
away
in
their
graveyard
but
i
feel
that
it
is
necessary
that
i
should
live
i
have
just
minutes
to
catch
the
train
so
for
the
present
i
must
be
gone
we
shall
have
our
talk
out
at
the
next
convenient
opportunity
if
you
take
my
advice
do
you
delay
in
getting
away
either
i
salute
you
queen
bee
queen
of
the
bleeding
hearts
queen
of
desolation
sandip
then
left
almost
at
a
run
i
stood
i
had
never
realized
in
such
a
manner
before
how
trivial
how
paltry
this
gold
and
these
jewels
were
only
a
short
while
ago
i
was
so
busy
thinking
what
i
should
take
with
me
and
how
i
should
pack
it
now
i
felt
that
there
was
no
need
to
take
anything
at
all
to
set
out
and
go
forth
was
the
important
thing
my
husband
left
his
seat
and
came
up
and
took
me
by
the
hand
it
is
getting
late
he
said
there
is
not
much
time
left
to
complete
our
preparations
for
the
journey
at
this
point
chandranath
babu
suddenly
came
in
finding
us
both
together
he
fell
back
for
a
moment
then
he
said
forgive
me
my
little
mother
if
i
intrude
nikhil
the
mussulmans
are
out
of
hand
they
are
looting
harish
kundu
treasury
that
does
not
so
much
matter
but
what
is
intolerable
is
the
violence
that
is
being
done
to
the
women
of
their
house
i
am
off
said
my
husband
what
can
you
do
there
i
pleaded
as
i
held
him
by
the
hand
oh
sir
i
appealed
to
his
master
will
you
not
tell
him
not
to
go
my
little
mother
he
replied
there
is
no
time
to
do
anything
else
do
be
alarmed
bimal
said
my
husband
as
he
left
us
when
i
went
to
the
window
i
saw
my
husband
galloping
away
on
horseback
with
not
a
weapon
in
his
hands
in
another
minute
the
bara
rani
came
running
in
what
have
you
done
chotie
darling
she
cried
how
could
you
let
him
go
call
the
dewan
at
once
she
said
turning
to
a
servant
the
ranis
never
appeared
before
the
dewan
but
the
bara
rani
had
no
thought
that
day
for
appearances
send
a
mounted
man
to
bring
back
the
maharaja
at
once
she
said
as
soon
as
the
dewan
came
up
we
have
all
entreated
him
to
stay
rani
mother
said
the
dewan
but
he
refused
to
turn
back
send
word
to
him
that
the
bara
rani
is
ill
that
she
is
on
her
cried
my
wildly
when
the
dewan
had
left
she
turned
on
me
with
a
furious
outburst
oh
you
witch
you
ogress
you
could
not
die
yourself
but
needs
must
send
him
to
his
death
the
light
of
the
day
began
to
fade
the
sun
set
behind
the
feathery
foliage
of
the
blossoming
tree
i
can
see
every
different
shade
of
that
sunset
even
today
two
masses
of
cloud
on
either
side
of
the
sinking
orb
made
it
look
like
a
great
bird
with
wings
outspread
it
seemed
to
me
that
this
fateful
day
was
taking
its
flight
to
cross
the
ocean
of
night
it
became
darker
and
darker
like
the
flames
of
a
distant
village
on
fire
leaping
up
every
now
and
then
above
the
horizon
a
distant
din
swelled
up
in
recurring
waves
into
the
darkness
the
bells
of
the
evening
worship
rang
out
from
our
temple
i
knew
the
bara
rani
was
sitting
there
with
palms
joined
in
silent
prayer
but
i
could
not
move
a
step
from
the
window
the
roads
the
village
beyond
and
the
still
more
distant
fringe
of
trees
grew
more
and
more
vague
the
lake
in
our
grounds
looked
up
into
the
sky
with
a
dull
lustre
like
a
blind
eye
on
the
left
the
tower
seemed
to
be
craning
its
neck
to
catch
sight
of
something
that
was
happening
the
sounds
of
night
take
on
all
manner
of
disguises
a
twig
snaps
and
one
thinks
that
somebody
is
running
for
his
life
a
door
slams
and
one
feels
it
to
be
the
sudden
of
a
startled
world
lights
would
suddenly
flicker
under
the
shade
of
the
distant
trees
and
then
go
out
again
horses
hoofs
would
clatter
now
and
again
only
to
turn
out
to
be
riders
leaving
the
palace
gates
i
continually
had
the
feeling
that
if
only
i
could
die
all
this
turmoil
would
come
to
an
end
so
long
as
i
was
alive
my
sins
would
remain
rampant
scattering
destruction
on
every
side
i
remembered
the
pistol
in
my
box
but
my
feet
refused
to
leave
the
window
in
quest
of
it
was
i
not
awaiting
my
fate
the
gong
of
the
watch
solemnly
struck
ten
a
little
later
groups
of
lights
appeared
in
the
distance
and
a
great
crowd
wound
its
way
like
some
great
serpent
along
the
roads
in
the
darkness
towards
the
palace
gates
the
dewan
rushed
to
the
gate
at
the
sound
just
then
a
rider
came
galloping
in
what
the
news
jata
asked
the
dewan
not
good
was
the
reply
i
could
hear
these
words
distinctly
from
my
window
but
something
was
next
whispered
which
i
could
not
catch
then
came
a
palanquin
followed
by
a
litter
the
doctor
was
walking
alongside
the
palanquin
what
do
you
think
doctor
asked
the
dewan
ca
say
yet
the
doctor
replied
the
wound
in
the
head
is
a
serious
one
and
amulya
babu
he
has
a
bullet
through
the
heart
he
is
done
for
the
home
and
the
world
