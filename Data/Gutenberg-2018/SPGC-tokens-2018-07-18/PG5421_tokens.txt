in

britain
chapter
i
return
at
the
general
said
to
his
chauffeur
and
then
they
entered
the
corridor
of
the
hotel
montague
gazed
about
him
and
found
himself
trembling
just
a
little
with
anticipation
it
was
not
the
magnificence
of
the
place
the
quiet
uptown
hotel
would
have
seemed
magnificent
to
him
fresh
as
he
was
from
the
country
but
he
did
not
see
the
marble
columns
and
the
gilded
was
thinking
of
the
men
he
was
to
meet
it
seemed
too
much
to
crowd
into
one
the
vision
of
the
whirling
seething
city
the
centre
of
all
his
hopes
of
the
future
and
then
at
night
this
meeting
overwhelming
him
with
the
crowded
memories
of
everything
that
he
held
precious
in
the
past
there
were
groups
of
men
in
faded
uniforms
standing
about
in
the
corridors
general
prentice
bowed
here
and
there
as
they
retired
and
took
the
elevator
to
the
in
the
doorway
they
passed
a
stout
little
man
with
stubby
white
moustaches
and
the
general
stopped
exclaiming
hello
major
then
he
added
let
me
introduce
allan
montague
montague
this
is
major
thorne
a
look
of
sudden
interest
flashed
across
the
major
face
general
montague
son
he
cried
and
then
he
seized
the
other
hand
in
both
of
his
exclaiming
my
boy
my
boy
i
glad
to
see
you
now
montague
was
no
boy
he
was
a
man
of
thirty
and
rather
sedate
in
his
appearance
and
manner
there
was
enough
in
his
six
feet
one
to
have
made
two
of
the
round
and
rubicund
little
major
and
yet
it
seemed
to
him
quite
proper
that
the
other
should
address
him
so
he
was
back
in
his
boyhood
he
was
a
boy
whenever
anyone
mentioned
the
name
of
major
thorne
perhaps
you
have
heard
your
father
speak
of
me
asked
the
major
eagerly
and
montague
answered
a
thousand
times
he
was
tempted
to
add
that
the
vision
that
rose
before
him
was
of
a
stout
gentleman
hanging
in
a
while
a
whole
battery
of
artillery
made
him
their
target
perhaps
it
was
irreverent
but
that
was
what
montague
had
always
thought
of
ever
since
he
had
first
laughed
over
the
tale
his
father
told
it
had
happened
one
january
afternoon
in
the
wilderness
during
the
terrible
battle
of
chancellorsville
when
montague
father
had
been
a
rising
young
and
it
had
fallen
to
his
lot
to
carry
to
major
thorne
what
was
surely
the
most
terrifying
order
that
ever
a
cavalry
officer
received
it
was
in
the
crisis
of
the
conflict
when
the
army
of
the
potomac
was
reeling
before
the
onslaught
of
stonewall
jackson
columns
there
was
no
one
to
stop
yet
they
must
be
stopped
for
the
whole
right
wing
of
the
army
was
going
so
that
cavalry
regiment
had
charged
full
tilt
through
the
thickets
and
into
a
solid
wall
of
infantry
and
artillery
the
crash
of
their
volley
was
blinding
and
horses
wore
fairly
shot
to
fragments
and
the
horse
with
its
lower
jaw
torn
off
had
plunged
madly
away
and
left
its
rider
hanging
in
the
aforementioned
after
he
had
kicked
himself
loose
it
was
to
find
himself
in
an
arena
where
horses
and
frenzied
men
raced
about
amid
a
rain
of
and
canister
and
in
this
inferno
the
gallant
major
had
captured
a
horse
and
rallied
the
remains
of
his
shattered
command
and
held
the
line
until
help
then
helped
to
hold
it
all
through
the
afternoon
and
the
twilight
and
the
night
against
charge
after
and
now
to
stand
and
gaze
at
this
stout
and
little
personage
and
realize
that
these
mighty
deeds
had
been
his
then
even
while
montague
was
returning
his
and
telling
him
of
his
pleasure
the
major
eye
caught
some
one
across
the
room
and
he
called
eagerly
colonel
anderson
colonel
anderson
and
this
was
the
heroic
jack
anderson
parson
anderson
the
men
had
called
him
because
he
always
prayed
before
everything
he
did
prayers
at
each
mess
a
in
the
evening
and
then
rumour
said
the
colonel
prayed
on
while
his
men
slept
with
his
battery
of
artillery
trained
to
perfection
under
three
years
of
divine
guidance
the
gallant
colonel
had
stood
in
the
line
of
battle
at
cold
harbour
name
of
frightful
memory
and
when
the
enemy
had
swarmed
out
of
their
intrenchments
and
swept
back
the
whole
line
just
beyond
him
his
battery
had
stood
like
a
cape
in
a
ocean
attacked
on
two
sides
at
once
and
for
the
that
elapsed
before
infantry
support
came
up
the
colonel
had
ridden
slowly
up
and
down
his
line
repeating
in
calm
and
godly
accents
give
hell
boys
give
hell
the
colonel
hand
trembled
now
as
he
held
it
out
and
his
voice
was
shrill
and
cracked
as
he
told
what
pleasure
it
gave
him
to
meet
general
montague
son
why
have
we
never
seen
you
before
asked
major
thorne
montague
replied
that
he
had
spent
all
his
life
in
mississippi
his
father
having
married
a
southern
woman
after
the
war
once
every
year
the
general
had
come
to
new
york
to
attend
the
reunion
of
the
loyal
legion
of
the
state
but
some
one
had
had
to
stay
at
home
with
his
mother
montague
explained
there
were
perhaps
a
hundred
men
in
the
room
and
he
was
passed
about
from
group
to
group
many
of
them
had
known
his
father
intimately
it
seemed
almost
uncanny
to
him
to
meet
them
in
the
body
to
find
them
old
and
feeble
and
wrinkled
as
they
lived
in
the
chambers
of
his
memory
they
were
in
their
mighty
transfigured
and
radiant
not
subject
to
the
power
of
time
life
on
the
big
plantation
had
been
a
lonely
one
especially
for
a
man
who
had
fought
in
the
union
army
general
montague
had
been
a
person
of
quiet
tastes
and
his
greatest
pleasure
had
been
to
sit
with
his
two
boys
on
his
knees
and
fight
his
battles
again
he
had
collected
all
the
literature
of
the
corps
which
he
had
commanded
a
whole
library
of
it
in
which
allan
had
learned
to
find
his
way
as
soon
as
he
could
read
he
had
literally
been
brought
up
on
the
war
for
hours
he
would
lie
buried
in
some
big
illustrated
history
until
people
came
and
called
him
away
he
studied
maps
of
campaigns
and
until
they
became
alive
with
human
passion
and
struggle
he
knew
the
army
of
the
potomac
by
brigade
and
division
with
the
names
of
commanders
and
their
faces
and
their
they
lived
and
spoke
and
the
bare
roll
of
their
names
had
power
to
thrill
and
now
here
were
the
men
themselves
and
all
these
scenes
and
memories
crowding
upon
him
in
tumultuous
throngs
no
wonder
that
he
was
a
little
dazed
and
could
hardly
find
words
to
answer
when
he
was
spoken
to
but
then
came
an
incident
which
called
him
suddenly
back
to
the
world
of
the
present
there
is
judge
ellis
said
the
general
judge
ellis
the
fame
of
his
wit
and
eloquence
had
reached
even
far
mississippi
was
there
any
remotest
corner
of
america
where
men
had
not
heard
of
the
silver
tongue
of
judge
ellis
cultivate
him
brother
oliver
had
laughed
when
it
was
mentioned
that
the
judge
would
be
present
cultivate
him
he
may
be
useful
it
was
not
difficult
to
cultivate
one
who
was
as
gracious
as
judge
ellis
he
stood
in
the
doorway
a
smooth
perfectly
groomed
gentleman
conspicuous
in
the
uniformed
assembly
by
his
evening
dress
the
judge
was
stout
and
jovial
and
cultivated
dundreary
whiskers
and
a
beaming
smile
general
montague
son
he
exclaimed
as
he
pressed
the
young
man
hands
why
why
i
surprised
why
have
we
never
seen
you
before
montague
explained
that
he
had
only
been
in
new
york
about
six
hours
oh
i
see
said
the
judge
and
shall
you
remain
long
i
have
come
to
stay
was
the
reply
well
well
said
the
other
cordially
then
we
may
see
more
of
you
are
you
going
into
business
i
am
a
lawyer
said
montague
i
expect
to
practise
the
judge
quick
glance
had
been
taking
the
measure
of
the
tall
handsome
man
before
him
with
his
hair
and
grave
features
you
must
give
us
a
chance
to
try
your
mettle
he
said
and
then
as
others
approached
to
meet
him
and
he
was
forced
to
pass
on
he
laid
a
caressing
hand
on
montague
arm
whispering
with
a
sly
smile
i
mean
it
montague
felt
his
heart
beat
a
little
faster
he
had
not
welcomed
his
brother
suggestion
there
was
nothing
of
the
sycophant
in
him
but
he
meant
to
work
and
to
succeed
and
he
knew
what
the
favour
of
a
man
like
judge
ellis
would
mean
to
him
for
the
judge
was
the
idol
of
new
business
and
political
aristocracy
and
the
doorways
of
fortune
yielded
at
his
touch
there
were
rows
of
chairs
in
one
of
the
rooms
and
here
two
or
three
hundred
men
were
gathered
there
were
stands
of
in
the
corners
each
one
of
them
a
scroll
of
tragic
history
to
one
like
montague
who
understood
his
eye
roamed
over
them
while
the
secretary
was
reading
minutes
of
meetings
and
other
routine
announcements
then
he
began
to
study
the
assemblage
there
were
men
with
one
arm
and
men
with
one
leg
one
tottering
old
soldier
ninety
years
of
age
stone
blind
and
led
about
by
his
friends
the
loyal
legion
was
an
organization
and
to
that
extent
aristocratic
but
worldly
success
counted
for
nothing
in
it
some
of
its
members
were
struggling
to
exist
on
their
pensions
and
were
as
much
thought
of
as
a
man
like
general
prentice
who
was
president
of
one
of
the
city
largest
banks
and
a
rich
man
even
in
new
york
understanding
of
that
term
the
presiding
officer
introduced
colonel
robert
selden
who
will
read
the
paper
of
the
evening
of
spottsylvania
montague
started
at
the
name
for
bob
selden
had
been
one
of
his
messmates
and
had
fought
all
through
the
peninsula
campaign
at
his
side
he
was
a
tall
man
with
a
grey
imperial
the
room
was
still
as
he
arose
and
after
adjusting
his
glasses
he
began
to
read
his
story
he
recalled
the
situation
of
the
army
of
the
potomac
in
the
spring
of
for
three
years
it
had
marched
and
fought
stumbling
through
defeat
after
defeat
a
mighty
weapon
lacking
only
a
man
who
could
wield
it
now
at
last
the
man
had
come
one
who
would
put
them
into
the
battle
and
give
them
a
chance
to
fight
so
they
had
marched
into
the
wilderness
and
there
lee
struck
them
and
for
three
days
they
groped
in
a
blind
thicket
fighting
hand
to
hand
amid
suffocating
smoke
the
colonel
read
in
a
quiet
unassuming
voice
but
one
could
see
that
he
had
hold
of
his
hearers
by
the
light
that
crossed
their
features
when
he
told
of
the
army
recoil
from
the
shock
and
of
the
wild
joy
that
ran
through
the
ranks
when
they
took
up
their
march
to
the
left
and
realized
that
this
time
they
were
not
going
so
they
came
to
the
twelve
days
grapple
of
the
spottsylvania
campaign
there
was
still
the
wilderness
thicket
the
enemy
intrenchments
covering
about
eight
miles
lay
in
the
shape
of
a
dome
and
at
the
cupola
of
it
were
breastworks
of
heavy
timbers
banked
with
earth
and
with
a
ditch
and
a
tangle
of
trees
in
front
the
place
was
the
keystone
of
the
confederate
arch
and
the
name
of
it
was
the
angle
bloody
angle
montague
heard
the
man
who
sat
next
to
him
draw
in
his
breath
as
if
a
spasm
of
pain
had
shot
through
him
at
dawn
two
brigades
had
charged
and
captured
the
place
the
enemy
returned
to
the
attack
and
for
twenty
hours
thereafter
the
two
armies
fought
hurling
regiment
after
regiment
and
brigade
after
brigade
into
the
trenches
there
was
a
pouring
rain
and
the
smoke
hung
black
about
them
they
could
only
see
the
flashes
of
the
guns
and
the
faces
of
the
enemy
here
and
there
the
colonel
described
the
approach
of
his
regiment
they
lay
down
for
a
moment
in
a
swamp
and
the
sang
like
swarming
bees
and
split
the
blades
of
the
grass
above
them
then
they
charged
over
ground
that
ran
with
human
blood
in
the
trenches
the
bodies
of
dead
and
dying
men
lay
three
deep
and
were
trampled
out
of
sight
in
the
mud
by
the
feet
of
those
who
fought
they
would
crouch
behind
the
works
lifting
their
guns
high
over
their
heads
and
firing
into
the
throngs
on
the
other
side
again
and
again
men
sprang
upon
the
breastworks
and
fired
their
muskets
and
then
fell
dead
they
dragged
up
cannon
one
after
another
and
blew
holes
through
the
logs
and
raked
the
ground
with
charges
of
canister
while
the
colonel
read
still
in
his
calm
voice
you
might
see
men
leaning
forward
in
their
chairs
hands
clenched
teeth
set
they
knew
they
knew
had
there
ever
before
been
a
time
in
history
when
breastworks
had
been
charged
by
artillery
men
in
the
crew
of
one
gun
and
only
two
unhurt
one
iron
with
bullet
holes
shot
through
it
and
then
blasts
of
canister
sweeping
the
trenches
and
blowing
scores
of
living
and
dead
men
to
fragments
and
into
this
hell
of
slaughter
new
regiments
charging
in
lines
four
deep
and
squad
after
squad
of
the
enemy
striving
to
surrender
and
shot
to
pieces
by
their
own
comrades
as
they
clambered
over
the
walls
and
heavy
timbers
in
the
defences
shot
to
splinters
huge
oak
trees
one
of
them
inches
in
diameter
crashing
down
upon
the
combatants
gnawed
through
by
since
the
world
began
had
men
ever
fought
like
that
then
the
colonel
told
of
his
own
wound
in
the
shoulder
and
how
toward
dusk
he
had
crawled
away
and
how
he
became
lost
and
strayed
into
the
enemy
line
and
was
thrust
into
a
batch
of
prisoners
and
marched
to
the
rear
and
then
of
the
night
that
he
spent
beside
a
hospital
camp
in
the
wilderness
where
hundreds
of
wounded
and
dying
men
lay
about
on
the
ground
moaning
screaming
praying
to
be
killed
again
the
prisoners
were
moved
having
been
ordered
to
march
to
the
railroad
and
on
the
way
the
colonel
went
blind
from
suffering
and
exhaustion
and
staggered
and
fell
in
the
road
you
could
have
heard
a
pin
drop
in
the
room
in
the
pause
between
sentences
in
his
story
as
he
told
how
the
guard
argued
with
him
to
persuade
him
to
go
on
it
was
their
duty
to
kill
him
if
he
refused
but
they
could
not
bring
themselves
to
do
it
in
the
end
they
left
the
job
to
one
and
he
stood
and
cursed
the
officer
trying
to
get
up
his
courage
and
finally
fired
his
gun
into
the
air
and
went
off
and
left
him
then
he
told
how
an
old
negro
had
found
him
and
how
he
lay
delirious
and
how
at
last
the
army
marched
his
way
he
ended
his
narrative
the
simple
sentence
it
was
not
until
the
siege
of
petersburg
that
i
was
able
to
rejoin
my
command
there
was
a
murmur
of
applause
and
then
silence
suddenly
from
somewhere
in
the
room
came
the
sound
of
singing
mine
eyes
have
seen
the
glory
of
the
coming
of
the
lord
the
old
seemed
to
strike
the
very
mood
of
the
meeting
the
whole
throng
took
it
up
and
they
sang
it
stanza
by
stanza
it
was
rolling
forth
like
a
mighty
as
they
came
to
the
fervid
closing
he
hath
sounded
forth
the
trumpet
that
shall
never
call
retreat
he
is
sifting
out
the
hearts
of
men
before
his
judgment
seat
oh
be
swift
my
soul
to
answer
him
be
jubilant
my
feet
our
god
is
marching
on
there
was
a
pause
again
and
the
presiding
officer
rose
and
said
that
owing
to
the
presence
of
a
distinguished
guest
they
would
forego
one
of
their
rules
and
invite
judge
ellis
to
say
a
few
words
the
judge
came
forward
and
bowed
his
acknowledgment
of
their
welcome
then
perhaps
feeling
a
need
of
relief
after
the
sombre
recital
the
judge
took
occasion
to
apologize
for
his
own
temerity
in
addressing
a
roomful
of
warriors
and
somehow
he
managed
to
make
that
remind
him
of
a
story
of
an
army
mule
a
very
amusing
story
and
that
reminded
him
of
another
story
until
when
he
stopped
and
sat
down
every
one
in
the
room
broke
into
delighted
applause
they
went
in
to
dinner
montague
sat
by
general
prentice
and
he
in
turn
by
the
judge
the
latter
was
reminded
of
more
stories
during
the
dinner
and
kept
every
one
near
him
laughing
finally
montague
was
moved
to
tell
a
story
himself
about
an
old
negro
down
home
who
passed
himself
off
for
an
indian
the
judge
was
so
good
as
to
consider
this
an
immensely
funny
story
and
asked
permission
to
tell
it
himself
several
times
after
that
he
leaned
over
and
spoke
to
montague
who
felt
a
slight
twinge
of
guilt
as
he
recalled
his
brother
cynical
advice
cultivate
him
the
judge
was
so
willing
to
be
cultivated
however
that
it
gave
one
conscience
little
chance
they
went
back
to
the
again
chairs
were
shifted
and
little
groups
formed
and
cigars
and
pipes
brought
out
they
moved
the
precious
forward
and
some
one
produced
a
bugle
and
a
couple
of
drums
then
the
walls
of
the
place
shook
as
the
whole
company
burst
forth
bring
the
good
old
bugle
boys
we
sing
another
song
sing
it
with
a
spirit
that
will
start
the
world
along
sing
it
as
we
used
to
sing
it
fifty
thousand
strong
while
we
were
marching
through
georgia
it
was
wonderful
to
witness
the
fervour
with
which
they
went
through
this
rollicking
chant
whose
spirit
we
miss
because
we
hear
it
too
often
they
were
not
skilled
musicians
they
could
only
sing
loud
but
the
fire
leaped
into
their
eyes
and
they
swayed
with
the
rhythm
and
sang
montague
found
himself
watching
the
old
blind
soldier
who
sat
beating
his
foot
in
time
upon
his
face
the
look
of
one
who
sees
visions
and
then
he
noticed
another
man
a
little
irishman
one
of
the
drummers
the
very
spirit
of
the
drum
seemed
to
have
entered
into
him
into
his
hands
and
his
feet
his
eyes
and
his
head
and
his
round
little
body
he
played
a
long
roll
between
the
verses
and
it
seemed
as
if
he
must
surely
be
swept
away
upon
the
wings
of
it
catching
montague
eye
he
nodded
and
smiled
and
after
that
every
once
in
a
while
their
eyes
would
meet
and
exchange
a
greeting
they
sang
the
loyal
legioner
and
the
army
bean
and
john
brown
body
and
tramp
tramp
tramp
the
boys
are
marching
all
the
while
the
drum
rattled
and
thundered
and
the
little
drummer
laughed
and
sang
the
very
incarnation
of
the
spirit
of
the
soldier
they
stopped
for
a
while
and
the
little
man
came
over
and
was
introduced
lieutenant
was
his
name
and
after
he
had
left
general
prentice
leaned
over
to
montague
and
told
him
a
story
that
little
man
he
said
began
as
a
in
my
regiment
and
went
all
through
the
war
in
my
brigade
and
two
years
ago
i
met
him
on
the
street
one
cold
winter
night
as
thin
as
i
am
and
shivering
in
a
summer
overcoat
i
took
him
to
dinner
with
me
and
watched
him
eat
and
i
made
up
my
mind
there
was
something
wrong
i
made
him
take
me
home
and
do
you
know
the
man
was
starving
he
had
a
little
tobacco
shop
and
he
got
into
trouble
the
trust
had
taken
away
his
trade
and
he
had
a
sick
wife
and
a
daughter
clerking
at
six
dollars
a
week
the
general
went
on
to
tell
of
his
struggle
to
induce
the
little
man
to
accept
his
aid
to
accept
a
loan
of
a
few
hundreds
of
dollars
from
prentice
the
banker
i
never
had
anything
hurt
me
so
in
all
my
life
he
said
finally
i
took
him
into
the
bank
and
now
you
can
see
he
has
enough
to
eat
they
began
to
sing
again
and
montague
sat
and
thought
over
the
story
it
seemed
to
him
typical
of
the
thing
that
made
this
meeting
beautiful
to
him
of
the
spirit
of
brotherhood
and
service
that
reigned
they
sang
we
are
tenting
on
the
old
camp
ground
they
sang
benny
havens
oh
and
a
soldier
no
more
they
sang
other
songs
of
tenderness
and
sorrow
and
men
felt
a
trembling
in
their
voices
and
a
mist
stealing
over
their
eyes
upon
montague
a
spell
was
falling
over
these
men
and
their
story
there
hung
a
mystery
a
presence
of
wonder
that
discloses
itself
but
rarely
to
mortals
and
only
to
those
who
have
dreamed
and
dared
they
had
not
found
it
easy
to
do
their
duty
they
had
had
their
wives
and
children
their
homes
and
friends
and
familiar
places
and
all
these
they
had
left
to
serve
the
republic
they
had
taught
themselves
a
new
way
of
life
they
had
forged
themselves
into
an
iron
sword
of
war
they
had
marched
and
fought
in
dust
and
heat
in
pouring
rains
and
driving
icy
blasts
they
had
become
men
grim
and
terrible
in
with
limbs
of
steel
who
could
march
or
ride
for
days
and
nights
who
could
lie
down
and
sleep
upon
the
ground
in
and
winter
snows
who
were
ready
to
leap
at
a
word
and
seize
their
muskets
and
rush
into
the
cannon
mouth
they
had
learned
to
stare
into
the
face
of
death
to
meet
its
fiery
eyes
to
march
and
eat
and
sleep
to
laugh
and
play
and
sing
in
its
presence
to
carry
their
life
in
their
hands
and
toss
it
about
as
a
juggler
tosses
a
ball
and
this
for
freedom
for
the
goddess
with
the
flaming
eyes
who
trod
upon
the
and
called
to
them
in
the
shock
and
fury
of
the
battle
whose
trailing
robes
they
followed
through
the
dust
and
for
a
glimpse
of
whose
shining
face
they
had
kept
the
long
night
vigils
and
charged
upon
the
guns
in
the
morning
for
a
touch
of
whose
shimmering
robe
they
had
wasted
in
prison
pens
where
famine
and
loathsome
pestilence
and
raving
madness
stalked
about
in
the
broad
daylight
and
now
this
army
of
deliverance
with
its
waving
banners
and
its
prancing
horses
and
its
rumbling
cannon
had
marched
into
the
the
very
ground
that
it
had
trod
was
sacred
and
one
who
fingered
the
dusty
volumes
which
held
the
record
of
its
deeds
would
feel
a
strange
awe
come
upon
him
and
thrill
with
a
sudden
fear
of
life
that
was
so
fleeting
and
so
little
to
be
understood
there
were
boyhood
memories
in
montague
mind
of
hours
of
consecration
when
the
vision
had
descended
upon
him
and
he
had
sat
with
face
hidden
in
his
hands
it
was
for
the
republic
that
these
men
had
suffered
for
him
and
his
children
that
a
government
of
the
people
by
the
people
for
the
people
might
not
perish
from
the
earth
and
with
the
of
the
gettysburg
address
echoing
within
him
the
boy
laid
his
soul
upon
the
altar
of
his
country
they
had
done
so
much
for
him
and
now
was
there
anything
that
he
could
do
a
dozen
years
had
passed
since
then
and
still
he
knew
that
deep
within
him
deeper
than
all
other
purposes
than
all
thoughts
of
wealth
and
fame
and
power
was
the
purpose
that
the
men
who
had
died
for
the
republic
should
find
him
worthy
of
their
trust
the
singing
had
stopped
and
judge
ellis
was
standing
before
him
the
judge
was
about
to
go
and
in
his
caressing
voice
he
said
that
he
would
hope
to
see
montague
again
then
seeing
that
general
prentice
was
also
standing
up
montague
threw
off
the
spell
that
had
gripped
him
and
shook
hands
with
the
little
drummer
and
with
selden
and
anderson
and
all
the
others
of
his
dream
people
a
few
minutes
later
he
found
himself
outside
the
hotel
drinking
deep
draughts
of
the
cold
november
air
major
thorne
had
come
out
with
them
and
learning
that
the
route
lay
uptown
he
offered
to
walk
with
montague
to
his
hotel
they
set
out
and
then
montague
told
the
major
about
the
figure
in
the
and
the
major
laughed
and
told
how
it
had
felt
there
had
been
more
adventures
it
seemed
while
he
was
hunting
a
horse
he
had
come
upon
two
mules
loaded
with
ammunition
and
entangled
with
their
harness
about
a
tree
he
had
rushed
up
to
seize
them
when
a
solid
shot
had
struck
the
tree
and
exploded
the
ammunition
and
blown
the
mules
to
fragments
and
then
there
was
the
story
of
the
charge
late
in
the
night
which
had
recovered
the
lost
ground
and
kept
stonewall
jackson
busy
up
to
the
very
hour
of
his
tragic
death
and
there
was
the
story
of
andersonville
and
the
escape
from
prison
montague
could
have
walked
the
streets
all
night
exchanging
these
reminiscences
with
the
major
absorbed
in
their
talk
they
came
to
an
avenue
given
up
to
the
poorer
class
of
people
with
elevated
trains
rattling
by
overhead
and
rows
of
little
shops
along
it
montague
noticed
a
dense
crowd
on
one
of
the
corners
and
asked
what
it
meant
some
sort
of
a
meeting
said
the
major
they
came
nearer
and
saw
a
torch
with
a
man
standing
near
it
above
the
heads
of
the
crowd
it
looks
like
a
political
meeting
said
montague
but
it
ca
be
now
just
after
election
probably
it
a
socialist
said
the
major
they
at
it
all
the
time
they
crossed
the
avenue
and
then
they
could
see
plainly
the
man
was
lean
and
and
he
had
long
arms
which
he
waved
with
prodigious
violence
he
was
in
a
frenzy
of
excitement
pacing
this
way
and
that
and
leaning
over
the
throng
packed
about
him
because
of
a
passing
train
the
two
could
not
hear
a
sound
a
socialist
exclaimed
montague
wonderingly
what
do
they
want
i
not
sure
said
the
other
they
want
to
overthrow
the
government
the
train
passed
and
then
the
man
words
came
to
them
they
force
you
to
build
palaces
and
then
they
put
you
into
tenements
they
force
you
to
spin
fine
raiment
and
then
they
dress
you
in
rags
they
force
you
to
build
jails
and
then
they
lock
you
up
in
them
they
force
you
to
make
guns
and
then
they
shoot
you
with
them
they
own
the
political
parties
and
they
name
the
candidates
and
trick
you
into
voting
for
them
and
they
call
it
the
law
they
herd
you
into
armies
and
send
you
to
shoot
your
brothers
and
they
call
it
order
they
take
a
piece
of
coloured
rag
and
call
it
the
flag
and
teach
you
to
let
yourself
be
shot
and
they
call
it
patriotism
first
last
and
all
the
time
you
do
the
work
and
they
get
the
benefit
they
the
masters
and
owners
and
you
fools
fools
fools
the
man
voice
had
mounted
to
a
scream
and
he
flung
his
hands
into
the
air
and
broke
into
jeering
laughter
then
came
another
train
and
montague
could
not
hear
him
but
he
could
see
that
he
was
rushing
on
in
the
torrent
of
his
denunciation
montague
stood
rooted
to
the
spot
he
was
shocked
to
the
depths
of
his
being
he
could
scarcely
contain
himself
as
he
stood
there
he
longed
to
spring
forward
to
beard
the
man
where
he
stood
to
shout
him
down
to
rebuke
him
before
the
crowd
the
major
must
have
seen
his
agitation
for
he
took
his
arm
and
led
him
back
from
the
throng
saying
come
we
ca
help
it
but
but
he
protested
the
police
ought
to
arrest
him
they
do
sometimes
said
the
major
but
it
does
do
any
good
they
walked
on
and
the
sounds
of
the
shrill
voice
died
away
tell
me
said
montague
in
a
low
voice
does
that
go
on
very
often
around
the
corner
from
where
i
live
said
the
other
it
goes
on
every
saturday
night
and
do
the
people
listen
he
asked
sometimes
they
ca
keep
the
street
clear
was
the
reply
and
again
they
walked
in
silence
at
last
montague
asked
what
does
it
mean
the
major
shrugged
his
shoulders
perhaps
another
civil
war
said
he
chapter
ii
allan
montague
father
had
died
about
five
years
before
a
couple
of
years
later
his
younger
brother
oliver
had
announced
his
intention
of
seeking
a
career
in
new
york
he
had
no
profession
and
no
definite
plans
but
his
father
friends
were
men
of
influence
and
wealth
and
the
doors
were
open
to
him
so
he
had
turned
his
share
of
the
estate
into
cash
and
departed
oliver
was
a
gay
and
boy
with
all
the
material
of
a
prodigal
son
in
him
his
brother
had
more
than
half
expected
to
see
him
come
back
in
a
year
or
two
with
empty
pockets
but
new
york
had
seemed
to
agree
with
oliver
he
never
told
what
he
was
doing
what
he
wrote
was
simply
that
he
was
managing
to
keep
the
wolf
from
the
door
but
his
letters
hinted
at
expensive
ways
of
life
and
at
christmas
time
and
at
cousin
alice
birthday
he
would
send
home
presents
which
made
the
family
stare
montague
had
always
thought
of
himself
as
a
country
lawyer
and
planter
but
two
months
ago
a
fire
had
swept
away
the
family
mansion
and
then
on
top
of
that
had
come
an
offer
for
the
land
and
with
oliver
telegraphing
several
times
a
day
in
his
eagerness
they
had
taken
the
sudden
resolution
to
settle
up
their
affairs
and
move
to
new
york
there
were
montague
and
his
mother
and
cousin
alice
who
was
nineteen
and
old
mammy
lucy
montague
servant
oliver
had
met
them
at
jersey
city
radiant
with
happiness
he
looked
just
as
much
of
a
boy
as
ever
and
just
as
beautiful
excepting
that
he
was
a
little
paler
new
york
had
not
changed
him
at
all
there
was
a
man
in
uniform
from
the
hotel
to
take
charge
of
their
baggage
and
a
big
red
for
them
and
now
they
were
snugly
settled
in
their
apartments
with
the
younger
brother
on
duty
as
counsellor
and
guide
montague
had
come
to
begin
life
all
over
again
he
had
brought
his
money
and
he
expected
to
invest
it
and
to
live
upon
the
income
until
he
had
begun
to
earn
something
he
had
worked
hard
at
his
profession
and
he
meant
to
work
in
new
york
and
to
win
his
way
in
the
end
he
knew
almost
nothing
about
the
city
he
faced
it
with
the
eyes
of
a
child
one
began
to
learn
quickly
he
found
it
was
like
being
swept
into
a
maelstrom
first
the
hurrying
throngs
on
the
and
then
the
cabmen
and
the
newsboys
shouting
and
the
cars
with
clanging
gongs
then
the
swift
motor
gliding
between
trucks
and
carriages
and
around
corners
where
big
policemen
shepherded
the
scurrying
populace
and
then
fifth
avenue
with
its
rows
of
shops
and
towering
hotels
and
at
last
a
sudden
swing
round
a
corner
and
their
home
i
have
picked
a
quiet
family
place
for
you
oliver
had
said
and
that
had
greatly
pleased
his
brother
but
he
had
stared
in
dismay
when
he
entered
this
latest
apartment
hotel
which
catered
for
two
or
three
hundred
of
the
most
exclusive
of
the
city
aristocracy
and
noted
its
great
arcade
with
massive
doors
of
bronze
and
its
trimmed
with
caen
stone
and
italian
marble
and
roofed
with
a
vaulted
ceiling
painted
by
modern
masters
men
in
livery
bore
their
wraps
and
bowed
the
way
before
them
a
great
bronze
elevator
shot
them
to
the
proper
floor
and
they
went
to
their
rooms
down
a
corridor
walled
with
marble
and
paved
with
carpet
soft
as
a
cushion
here
were
six
rooms
of
palatial
size
with
carpets
drapery
and
furniture
of
a
splendour
quite
appalling
to
montague
as
soon
as
the
man
who
bore
their
wraps
had
left
the
room
he
turned
upon
his
brother
oliver
he
said
how
much
are
we
paying
for
all
this
oliver
smiled
you
are
not
paying
anything
old
man
he
replied
you
to
be
my
guests
for
a
month
or
two
until
you
get
your
bearings
that
very
good
of
you
said
the
other
we
talk
about
it
later
but
meantime
tell
me
what
the
apartment
costs
and
then
montague
encountered
his
first
full
charge
of
new
york
dynamite
six
hundred
dollars
a
week
said
oliver
he
started
as
if
his
brother
had
struck
him
six
hundred
dollars
a
week
he
gasped
yes
said
the
other
quietly
it
was
fully
a
minute
before
he
could
find
his
breath
brother
he
exclaimed
you
mad
it
is
a
very
good
bargain
smiled
the
other
i
have
some
influence
with
them
again
there
was
a
pause
while
montague
groped
for
words
oliver
he
exclaimed
i
ca
believe
you
how
could
you
think
that
we
could
pay
such
a
price
i
did
think
it
said
oliver
i
told
you
i
expected
to
pay
it
myself
but
how
could
we
let
you
pay
it
for
us
cried
the
other
can
you
fancy
that
will
ever
earn
enough
to
pay
such
a
price
of
course
you
will
said
oliver
do
be
foolish
allan
find
it
easy
enough
to
make
money
in
new
york
leave
it
to
me
and
wait
awhile
but
the
other
was
not
to
be
put
off
he
sat
down
on
the
embroidered
silk
bedspread
and
demanded
abruptly
what
do
you
expect
my
income
to
be
a
year
i
sure
i
do
know
laughed
oliver
nobody
takes
the
time
to
add
up
his
income
you
make
what
you
need
and
something
over
for
good
measure
this
one
thing
you
know
for
certain
the
more
you
spend
the
more
you
be
able
to
make
and
then
seeing
that
the
sober
look
was
not
to
be
expelled
from
his
brother
face
oliver
seated
himself
and
crossed
his
legs
and
proceeded
to
set
forth
the
paradoxical
philosophy
of
extravagance
his
brother
had
come
into
a
city
of
millionaires
there
was
a
certain
group
of
people
the
right
set
was
oliver
term
for
them
and
among
them
he
would
find
that
money
was
as
free
as
air
so
far
as
his
career
was
concerned
he
would
find
that
there
was
nothing
in
all
new
york
so
costly
as
economy
if
he
did
not
live
like
a
gentleman
he
would
find
himself
excluded
from
the
circle
of
the
elect
and
how
he
would
manage
to
exist
then
was
a
problem
too
difficult
for
his
brother
to
face
and
so
as
quickly
as
he
could
he
was
to
bring
himself
to
a
state
of
mind
where
things
did
not
surprise
him
where
he
did
what
others
did
and
paid
what
others
paid
and
did
it
serenely
as
if
he
had
done
it
all
his
life
he
would
soon
find
his
place
meantime
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
put
himself
into
his
brother
charge
you
find
in
time
that
i
have
the
strings
in
my
hands
the
latter
added
just
take
life
easy
and
let
me
introduce
you
to
the
right
people
all
of
which
sounded
very
attractive
but
are
you
sure
asked
montague
that
you
understand
what
i
here
for
i
do
want
to
get
into
the
four
hundred
you
know
i
want
to
practise
law
in
the
first
place
replied
oliver
do
talk
about
the
four
hundred
it
vulgar
and
silly
there
no
such
thing
in
the
next
place
you
going
to
live
in
new
york
and
you
want
to
know
the
right
people
if
you
know
them
you
can
practise
law
or
practise
billiards
or
practise
anything
else
that
you
fancy
if
you
do
know
them
you
might
as
well
go
practise
in
dahomey
for
all
you
can
accomplish
you
might
come
on
here
and
start
in
for
yourself
and
in
twenty
years
you
would
get
as
far
as
you
can
get
in
two
weeks
if
you
let
me
attend
to
it
montague
was
nearly
five
years
his
brother
senior
and
at
home
had
taken
a
attitude
toward
him
now
however
the
situation
seemed
to
have
reversed
itself
with
a
slight
smile
of
amusement
he
subsided
and
proceeded
to
put
himself
into
the
attitude
of
a
docile
student
of
the
mysteries
of
the
metropolis
they
agreed
that
they
would
say
nothing
about
these
matters
to
the
others
montague
was
half
blind
and
would
lead
her
placid
indoor
existence
with
old
mammy
lucy
as
for
alice
she
was
a
woman
and
would
not
trouble
herself
with
economics
if
fairy
godmothers
chose
to
shower
gifts
upon
her
she
would
take
them
alice
was
built
to
live
in
a
palace
anyway
oliver
said
he
had
cried
out
with
delight
when
he
first
saw
her
she
had
been
sixteen
when
he
left
and
tall
and
thin
now
she
was
nineteen
and
with
the
pale
tints
of
the
dawn
in
her
hair
and
face
in
the
auto
oliver
had
turned
and
stared
at
her
and
pronounced
the
cryptic
judgment
you
go
just
now
she
was
wandering
about
the
rooms
exclaiming
with
wonder
everything
here
was
so
quiet
and
so
harmonious
that
at
first
suspicions
were
lulled
it
was
simplicity
but
of
a
strange
and
perplexing
kind
simplicity
elaborately
studied
it
was
luxury
but
grown
assured
of
itself
and
gazing
down
upon
itself
with
aristocratic
disdain
and
after
a
while
this
began
to
penetrate
the
vulgarest
mind
and
to
fill
it
with
awe
one
can
not
remain
long
in
an
apartment
which
is
trimmed
and
furnished
in
rarest
circassian
walnut
and
papered
with
silk
cloth
without
feeling
some
excitement
even
though
there
be
no
one
to
mention
that
the
furniture
has
cost
eight
thousand
dollars
per
room
and
that
the
wall
covering
has
been
imported
from
paris
at
a
cost
of
seventy
dollars
per
yard
montague
also
betook
himself
to
gazing
about
he
noted
the
great
double
windows
with
sashes
of
bronze
the
bronze
doors
the
bronze
electric
candles
and
chandeliers
from
which
the
room
was
flooded
with
a
soft
radiance
at
the
touch
of
a
button
the
duchesse
and
marquise
chairs
with
upholstery
matching
the
walls
the
huge
leather
with
adjustable
lamp
at
its
head
when
one
opened
the
door
of
the
closet
it
was
automatically
filled
with
light
there
was
an
adjustable
mirror
at
which
one
could
study
his
own
figure
from
every
side
there
was
a
little
bronze
box
near
the
bed
in
which
one
might
set
his
shoes
and
with
a
locked
door
opening
out
into
the
hall
so
that
the
could
get
them
without
disturbing
one
each
of
the
was
the
size
of
an
ordinary
man
parlour
with
floor
and
walls
of
marble
and
a
door
composed
of
an
imported
mirror
there
was
a
great
porcelain
tub
with
glass
handles
upon
the
wall
by
which
you
could
help
yourself
out
of
it
and
a
with
linen
duck
curtains
which
were
changed
every
day
and
a
marble
slab
upon
which
you
might
lie
to
be
rubbed
by
the
masseur
who
would
come
at
the
touch
of
a
button
there
was
no
end
to
the
miracles
of
this
establishment
as
montague
found
in
the
course
of
time
there
was
no
chance
that
the
antique
bronze
clock
on
the
mantel
might
go
wrong
for
it
was
electrically
controlled
from
the
office
you
did
not
open
the
window
and
let
in
the
dust
for
the
room
was
automatically
ventilated
and
you
turned
a
switch
marked
hot
and
cold
the
office
would
furnish
you
a
guide
who
would
show
you
the
establishment
and
you
might
see
your
bread
being
kneaded
by
electricity
upon
an
opal
glass
table
and
your
eggs
being
tested
by
electric
light
you
might
peer
into
huge
refrigerators
ventilated
by
electric
fans
and
in
which
each
tiny
lamb
chop
reposed
in
a
separate
holder
upon
your
own
floor
was
a
pantry
provided
with
hot
and
cold
and
an
you
might
have
your
own
private
linen
and
crockery
and
plate
and
your
own
family
butler
if
you
wished
your
children
however
would
not
be
permitted
in
the
building
even
though
you
were
dying
this
was
a
small
concession
which
you
made
to
a
host
who
had
invested
a
million
dollars
and
a
half
in
furniture
alone
a
few
minutes
later
the
telephone
bell
rang
and
oliver
answered
it
and
said
send
him
up
here
the
tailor
he
remarked
as
he
hung
up
the
receiver
whose
tailor
asked
his
brother
yours
said
he
do
i
have
to
have
some
new
clothes
montague
asked
you
have
any
clothes
at
present
was
the
reply
montague
was
standing
in
front
of
the
costumer
as
the
elaborate
mirror
was
termed
he
looked
himself
over
and
then
he
looked
at
his
brother
oliver
clothing
was
a
little
like
the
circassian
walnut
at
first
you
thought
that
it
was
simple
and
even
a
trifle
careless
it
was
only
by
degrees
you
realized
that
it
was
original
and
distinguished
and
very
expensive
wo
your
new
york
friends
make
allowance
for
the
fact
that
i
am
fresh
from
the
country
asked
montague
quizzically
they
might
was
the
reply
i
know
a
hundred
who
would
lend
me
money
if
i
asked
them
but
i
do
ask
them
then
how
soon
shall
i
be
able
to
appear
asked
montague
with
visions
of
himself
locked
up
in
the
room
for
a
week
or
two
you
are
to
have
three
suits
morning
said
oliver
genet
has
promised
suits
made
to
order
gasped
the
other
in
perplexity
he
never
heard
of
any
other
sort
of
suits
said
oliver
with
grave
rebuke
in
his
voice
genet
had
the
presence
of
a
russian
grand
duke
and
the
manner
of
a
court
chamberlain
he
brought
a
subordinate
to
take
montague
measure
while
he
himself
studied
his
montague
gathered
from
the
conversation
that
he
was
going
to
a
in
the
country
the
next
morning
and
that
he
would
need
a
a
and
a
morning
coat
the
rest
might
wait
until
his
return
the
two
discussed
him
and
his
various
points
as
they
might
have
discussed
a
horse
he
possessed
distinction
he
learned
and
a
great
deal
could
be
done
with
him
with
a
little
skill
he
might
be
made
into
a
personality
his
french
was
not
in
training
but
he
managed
to
make
out
that
it
was
genet
opinion
that
the
husbands
of
new
york
would
tremble
when
he
made
his
appearance
among
them
when
the
tailor
had
left
alice
came
in
with
her
face
shining
from
a
cold
bathing
here
you
are
decking
yourselves
out
she
cried
and
what
about
me
your
problem
is
harder
said
oliver
with
a
laugh
but
you
begin
this
afternoon
reggie
mann
is
going
to
take
you
with
him
and
get
you
some
dresses
what
gasped
alice
get
me
some
dresses
a
man
of
course
said
the
other
reggie
mann
advises
half
the
women
in
new
york
about
their
clothes
who
is
he
a
tailor
asked
the
girl
oliver
was
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
canapé
swinging
one
leg
over
the
other
and
he
stopped
abruptly
and
stared
and
then
sank
back
laughing
softly
to
himself
oh
dear
me
he
said
poor
reggie
then
realizing
that
he
would
have
to
begin
at
the
beginning
he
proceeded
to
explain
that
reggie
mann
was
a
cotillion
leader
the
idol
of
the
feminine
side
of
society
he
was
the
special
pet
and
protege
of
the
great
de
graffenried
of
whom
they
had
surely
heard
de
graffenried
who
was
acknowledged
to
be
the
mistress
of
society
at
newport
and
was
destined
some
day
to
be
mistress
in
new
york
reggie
and
oliver
were
thick
and
he
had
stayed
in
town
on
purpose
to
attend
to
her
attiring
having
seen
her
picture
and
vowed
that
he
would
make
a
work
of
art
out
of
her
and
then
robbie
walling
would
give
her
a
dance
and
all
the
world
would
come
to
fall
at
her
feet
you
and
i
are
going
out
to
forest
the
oliver
added
to
his
brother
you
meet
robbie
there
you
heard
of
the
wallings
i
hope
yes
said
montague
i
not
that
ignorant
all
right
said
the
other
we
to
motor
down
i
going
to
take
you
in
my
so
you
have
an
experience
we
start
early
i
be
ready
said
montague
and
when
his
brother
replied
that
he
would
be
at
the
door
at
eleven
he
made
another
amused
note
as
to
the
habits
of
new
yorkers
the
price
which
he
paid
at
the
hotel
included
the
services
of
a
valet
or
a
maid
for
each
of
them
and
so
when
their
baggage
arrived
they
had
nothing
to
do
they
went
to
lunch
in
one
of
the
main
of
the
hotel
a
room
with
towering
columns
of
marble
and
a
maze
of
palms
and
flowers
oliver
did
the
ordering
his
brother
noticed
that
the
simple
meal
cost
them
about
fifteen
dollars
and
he
wondered
if
they
were
to
eat
at
that
rate
all
the
time
then
montague
mentioned
the
fact
that
before
leaving
home
he
had
received
a
telegram
from
general
prentice
asking
him
to
go
with
him
that
evening
to
the
meeting
of
the
loyal
legion
montague
wondered
half
amused
if
his
brother
would
deem
his
old
clothing
fit
for
such
a
function
but
oliver
replied
that
it
would
not
matter
what
he
wore
there
he
would
not
meet
anyone
who
counted
except
prentice
himself
the
general
and
his
family
were
prominent
in
society
it
appeared
and
were
to
be
cultivated
but
oliver
shrewdly
forbore
to
elaborate
upon
this
knowing
that
his
brother
would
be
certain
to
talk
about
old
times
which
would
be
the
surest
possible
method
of
lodging
himself
in
the
good
graces
of
general
prentice
after
luncheon
came
reggie
mann
dapper
and
exquisite
with
slender
little
figure
and
mincing
gait
and
the
delicate
hands
and
soft
voice
of
a
woman
he
was
dressed
for
the
afternoon
parade
and
wore
a
wonderful
scarlet
orchid
in
his
buttonhole
montague
hand
he
shook
at
his
shoulder
height
but
when
alice
came
in
he
did
not
shake
hands
with
her
instead
he
stood
and
gazed
and
gazed
again
and
lifting
his
hands
a
little
with
excess
of
emotion
exclaimed
oh
perfect
perfect
and
ollie
i
told
you
so
he
added
eagerly
she
it
tall
enough
to
wear
satin
she
shall
have
the
pale
blue
empire
gown
she
shall
have
the
pale
blue
empire
gown
if
i
have
to
pay
for
it
myself
and
oh
what
times
we
shall
have
with
that
hair
and
the
figure
reval
will
simply
go
wild
so
reggie
prattled
on
with
his
airy
grace
he
took
her
hand
and
studied
it
and
then
turned
her
about
to
survey
her
figure
while
alice
blushed
and
strove
to
laugh
to
hide
her
embarrassment
my
dear
miss
montague
he
exclaimed
i
bring
all
gotham
and
lay
it
at
your
feet
ollie
your
battle
is
won
won
without
firing
a
shot
i
know
the
very
man
for
her
his
father
is
dying
and
he
will
have
four
millions
in
transcontinental
alone
and
he
is
as
handsome
as
antinous
and
as
fascinating
as
don
juan
allons
we
may
as
well
begin
with
the
trousseau
this
afternoon
chapter
iii
oliver
was
not
rooming
with
them
he
had
his
own
quarters
at
the
club
which
he
did
not
wish
to
leave
but
the
next
morning
about
twenty
minutes
after
the
hour
he
had
named
he
was
at
the
door
and
montague
went
down
oliver
car
was
an
imported
french
racer
it
had
only
two
seats
open
in
front
with
a
rumble
behind
for
the
mechanic
it
was
long
and
low
and
rakish
a
most
object
whenever
it
stopped
on
the
street
a
crowd
gathered
to
stare
at
it
oliver
was
clad
in
a
black
bearskin
coat
covering
his
feet
and
with
cap
and
gloves
to
match
he
wore
goggles
pushed
up
over
his
forehead
a
similar
costume
lay
ready
in
his
brother
seat
the
suits
of
clothing
had
come
and
were
borne
in
his
grips
by
his
valet
we
ca
carry
them
with
us
said
oliver
he
have
to
take
them
down
by
train
and
while
his
brother
was
buttoning
up
the
coat
he
gave
the
address
then
montague
clambered
in
and
after
a
quick
glance
over
his
shoulder
oliver
pressed
a
lever
and
threw
over
the
and
they
whirled
about
and
sped
down
the
street
sometimes
at
home
in
mississippi
one
would
meet
automobiling
parties
generally
to
the
damage
of
one
harness
and
temper
but
until
the
day
before
when
he
had
stepped
off
the
ferry
montague
had
never
ridden
in
a
riding
in
this
one
was
like
travelling
in
a
dream
it
slid
along
without
a
sound
or
the
slightest
trace
of
vibration
it
shot
forward
it
darted
to
right
or
to
left
it
slowed
up
it
stopped
as
if
of
its
own
will
the
driver
seemed
to
do
nothing
such
things
as
car
tracks
had
no
effect
upon
it
at
all
and
serious
defects
in
the
pavement
caused
only
the
faintest
swelling
motion
it
was
only
when
it
leaped
ahead
like
a
living
thing
that
one
felt
the
power
of
it
by
the
pressure
upon
his
back
they
went
at
what
seemed
to
montague
a
breakneck
pace
through
the
city
streets
dodging
among
trucks
and
carriages
grazing
cars
whirling
round
corners
taking
the
wildest
of
chances
oliver
seemed
always
to
know
what
the
other
fellow
would
do
but
the
thought
that
he
might
do
something
different
kept
his
companion
heart
pounding
in
a
painful
way
once
the
latter
cried
out
as
a
man
leapt
for
his
life
oliver
laughed
and
said
without
turning
his
head
you
get
used
to
it
by
and
by
they
went
down
fourth
avenue
and
turned
into
the
bowery
elevated
trains
pounded
overhead
and
a
maze
of
cheap
and
sped
past
them
once
or
twice
oliver
glance
detected
a
blue
uniform
ahead
and
then
they
slowed
down
to
a
decorous
pace
and
the
other
got
a
chance
to
observe
the
miserable
population
of
the
neighbourhood
it
was
a
cold
november
day
and
an
out
of
work
time
and
wretched
outcast
men
walked
with
shoulders
drawn
forward
and
hands
in
their
pockets
where
in
the
world
are
we
going
montague
asked
to
long
island
said
the
other
it
a
beastly
ride
this
part
of
it
but
it
the
only
way
some
day
we
have
an
overhead
speedway
of
our
own
and
we
wo
have
to
drive
through
this
mess
they
turned
off
at
the
approach
to
the
williamsburg
bridge
and
found
the
street
closed
for
repairs
they
had
to
make
a
detour
of
a
block
and
they
turned
with
a
vicious
sweep
and
plunged
into
the
very
heart
of
the
tenement
district
narrow
filthy
streets
with
huge
blocks
of
buildings
covered
with
rusty
iron
and
decorated
with
and
pails
and
laundry
and
babies
narrow
stoops
crowded
with
playing
children
saloons
and
a
maze
of
placards
and
signs
in
english
and
german
and
yiddish
through
the
throngs
oliver
drove
his
brows
knitted
with
impatience
and
his
horn
honking
angrily
take
it
easy
protested
montague
but
the
other
answered
bah
children
screamed
and
darted
out
of
the
way
and
men
and
women
started
back
scowling
and
muttering
when
a
blockade
of
wagons
and
forced
them
to
stop
the
children
gathered
about
and
jeered
and
a
group
of
hoodlums
loafing
by
a
saloon
flung
ribaldry
at
them
but
oliver
never
turned
his
eyes
from
the
road
ahead
and
at
last
they
were
out
on
the
bridge
slow
vehicles
keep
to
the
right
ran
the
sign
and
so
there
was
a
lane
for
them
to
the
left
they
sped
up
the
slope
the
cold
air
beating
upon
them
like
a
hurricane
far
below
lay
the
river
with
tugs
and
ploughing
the
grey
water
and
a
city
spread
out
on
either
bank
a
wilderness
of
roofs
with
chimneys
sticking
up
and
white
jets
of
steam
spouting
everywhere
then
they
sped
down
the
farther
slope
and
into
brooklyn
there
was
an
asphalted
avenue
lined
with
little
residences
there
was
block
upon
block
of
them
mile
after
mile
of
them
montague
had
never
seen
so
many
houses
in
his
life
before
and
nearly
all
poured
out
of
the
same
mould
many
other
automobiles
were
speeding
out
by
this
avenue
and
they
raced
with
one
another
the
one
which
was
passed
the
most
frequently
got
the
dust
and
smell
and
so
the
universal
rule
was
that
when
you
were
behind
you
watched
for
a
clear
track
and
then
put
on
speed
and
went
to
the
front
but
then
just
when
you
had
struck
a
comfortable
pace
there
was
a
whirring
and
a
puffing
at
your
left
and
your
rival
came
stealing
past
you
if
you
were
ugly
you
put
on
speed
yourself
and
forced
him
to
fall
back
or
to
run
the
risk
of
trouble
with
vehicles
coming
the
other
way
for
oliver
there
seemed
to
be
but
one
rule
pass
everything
they
came
to
the
great
ocean
driveway
here
were
many
automobiles
nearly
all
going
one
way
and
nearly
all
racing
there
were
two
which
stuck
to
oliver
and
would
not
be
left
behind
one
two
three
one
two
three
they
passed
and
repassed
their
dust
was
blinding
and
the
continual
odour
was
sickening
and
so
oliver
set
his
lips
tight
and
the
little
dial
on
the
indicator
began
to
creep
ahead
and
they
whirled
away
down
the
drive
catch
us
this
time
he
muttered
a
few
seconds
later
oliver
gave
a
sudden
exclamation
as
a
policeman
concealed
behind
a
bush
at
the
roadside
sprang
out
and
hailed
them
the
policeman
had
a
and
oliver
shouted
to
the
mechanic
pull
the
cord
his
brother
turned
alarmed
and
perplexed
and
saw
the
man
reach
down
to
the
floor
of
the
car
he
saw
the
policeman
leap
upon
the
cycle
and
start
to
follow
then
he
lost
sight
of
him
in
the
clouds
of
dust
for
perhaps
five
minutes
they
tore
on
tense
and
silent
at
a
pace
that
montague
had
never
equalled
in
an
express
train
vehicles
coming
the
other
way
would
leap
into
sight
charging
straight
at
them
it
seemed
and
shooting
past
a
hand
breadth
away
montague
had
just
about
made
up
his
mind
that
one
such
ride
would
last
him
for
a
lifetime
when
he
noticed
that
they
were
slacking
up
you
can
let
go
the
cord
said
oliver
he
never
catch
us
now
what
is
the
cord
asked
the
other
it
tied
to
the
tag
with
our
number
on
in
back
it
swings
it
up
so
it
ca
be
seen
they
were
turning
off
into
a
country
road
and
montague
sank
back
and
laughed
till
the
tears
ran
down
his
cheeks
is
that
a
common
trick
he
asked
quite
said
the
other
robbie
has
a
trough
of
mud
in
their
garage
and
her
driver
sprinkles
the
tag
every
time
before
she
goes
out
you
have
to
do
something
you
know
or
you
be
taken
up
all
the
time
have
you
ever
been
arrested
i
only
been
in
court
once
said
oliver
i
been
stopped
a
dozen
times
what
did
they
do
the
other
times
warn
you
warn
me
laughed
oliver
what
they
did
was
to
get
in
with
me
and
ride
a
block
or
two
out
of
sight
of
the
crowd
and
then
i
slipped
them
a
bill
and
they
got
out
to
which
montague
responded
oh
i
see
they
turned
into
a
broad
macadamized
road
and
here
were
more
autos
and
more
dust
and
more
racing
now
and
then
they
crossed
a
trolley
or
a
railroad
track
and
here
was
always
a
warning
sign
but
oliver
must
have
had
some
occult
way
of
knowing
that
the
track
was
clear
for
he
never
seemed
to
slow
up
now
and
then
they
came
to
villages
and
did
reduce
speed
but
from
the
pace
at
which
they
went
through
the
villagers
could
not
have
suspected
it
and
then
came
another
adventure
the
road
was
in
repair
and
was
very
bad
and
they
were
picking
their
way
when
suddenly
a
young
man
who
had
been
walking
on
a
side
path
stepped
out
before
them
and
drew
a
red
handkerchief
from
his
pocket
and
faced
them
waving
it
oliver
muttered
an
oath
what
the
matter
cried
his
brother
we
arrested
he
exclaimed
what
gasped
the
other
why
we
were
not
going
at
all
i
know
said
oliver
but
they
got
us
all
the
same
he
must
have
made
up
his
mind
at
one
glance
that
the
case
was
hopeless
for
he
made
no
attempt
to
put
on
speed
but
let
the
young
man
step
aboard
as
they
reached
him
what
is
it
oliver
demanded
i
have
been
sent
out
by
the
automobile
association
said
the
stranger
to
warn
you
that
they
have
a
trap
set
in
the
next
town
so
watch
out
and
oliver
gave
a
gasp
and
said
oh
thank
you
the
young
man
stepped
off
and
they
went
ahead
and
he
lay
back
in
his
seat
and
shook
with
laughter
is
that
common
his
brother
asked
between
laughs
it
happened
to
me
once
before
said
oliver
but
i
forgotten
it
completely
they
proceeded
very
slowly
and
when
they
came
to
the
outskirts
of
the
village
they
went
at
a
funereal
pace
while
the
car
throbbed
in
protest
in
front
of
a
country
store
they
saw
a
group
of
loungers
watching
them
and
oliver
said
there
the
first
part
of
the
trap
they
have
a
telephone
and
somewhere
beyond
is
a
man
with
another
telephone
and
beyond
that
a
man
to
stretch
a
rope
across
the
road
what
would
they
do
with
you
asked
the
other
haul
you
up
before
a
justice
of
the
peace
and
fine
you
anywhere
from
fifty
to
two
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
it
regular
highway
robbery
there
are
some
places
that
boast
of
never
levying
taxes
they
get
all
their
money
out
of
us
oliver
pulled
out
his
watch
we
going
to
be
late
to
lunch
thanks
to
these
delays
he
said
he
added
that
they
were
to
meet
at
the
hawk
nest
which
he
said
was
an
automobile
joint
outside
of
the
town
they
hit
it
up
again
and
half
an
hour
later
they
came
to
a
huge
sign
to
the
hawk
nest
and
turned
off
they
ran
up
a
hill
and
came
suddenly
out
of
a
into
view
of
a
hostelry
perched
upon
the
edge
of
a
bluff
overlooking
the
sound
there
was
a
broad
yard
in
front
in
which
automobiles
wheeled
and
sputtered
and
a
long
shed
that
was
lined
with
them
half
a
dozen
attendants
ran
to
meet
them
as
they
drew
up
at
the
steps
they
all
knew
oliver
and
two
fell
to
brushing
his
coat
and
one
got
his
cap
while
the
mechanic
took
the
car
to
the
shed
oliver
had
a
tip
for
each
of
them
one
of
the
things
that
montague
observed
was
that
in
new
york
you
had
to
carry
a
pocketful
of
change
and
scatter
it
about
wherever
you
went
they
tipped
the
man
who
carried
their
coats
and
the
boy
who
opened
the
door
in
the
washrooms
they
tipped
the
boys
who
filled
the
basins
for
them
and
those
who
gave
them
a
second
brushing
the
piazzas
of
the
inn
were
crowded
with
automobiling
parties
in
all
sorts
of
strange
costumes
it
seemed
to
montague
that
most
of
them
were
flashy
people
the
men
had
red
faces
and
the
women
had
loud
voices
he
saw
one
in
a
coat
with
bright
scarlet
facing
it
occurred
to
him
that
if
these
women
had
not
worn
such
large
hats
they
would
not
have
needed
quite
such
a
supply
of
the
veiling
which
they
wound
over
the
hats
and
tied
under
their
chins
or
left
to
float
about
in
the
breeze
the
seemed
to
have
been
built
in
sections
rambling
about
on
the
summit
of
the
cliff
the
side
of
it
facing
the
water
was
all
glass
and
could
be
taken
down
the
ceiling
was
a
maze
of
streamers
and
japanese
lanterns
and
here
and
there
were
and
palms
and
artificial
streams
and
fountains
every
table
was
crowded
it
seemed
one
was
by
the
clatter
of
plates
the
voices
and
laughter
and
the
uproar
of
a
negro
orchestra
of
banjos
mandolins
and
guitars
negro
waiters
flew
here
and
there
and
a
huge
stout
who
was
pirouetting
and
strutting
suddenly
espied
oliver
and
made
for
him
with
smiles
of
welcome
yes
sir
just
come
in
sir
he
said
and
led
the
way
down
the
room
to
where
in
a
corner
a
table
had
been
set
for
sixteen
or
eighteen
people
there
was
a
shout
here
ollie
and
a
pounding
of
glasses
and
a
chorus
of
welcome
hello
ollie
you
late
ollie
what
the
matter
car
broke
down
of
the
party
about
half
were
men
and
half
women
montague
braced
himself
for
the
painful
ordeal
of
being
introduced
to
sixteen
people
in
succession
but
this
was
considerately
spared
him
he
shook
hands
with
robbie
walling
a
tall
and
rather
young
man
with
slight
yellow
moustaches
and
with
robbie
who
bade
him
welcome
and
presented
him
with
the
freedom
of
the
company
then
he
found
himself
seated
between
two
young
ladies
with
a
waiter
leaning
over
him
to
take
his
order
for
the
drinks
he
said
a
little
hesitatingly
that
he
would
like
some
whisky
as
he
was
about
frozen
upon
which
the
girl
on
his
right
remarked
you
better
try
a
champagne
cocktail
you
get
your
results
quicker
she
added
to
the
waiter
bring
a
couple
of
them
and
be
quick
about
it
you
had
a
cold
ride
no
doubt
in
that
low
car
she
went
on
to
montague
what
made
you
late
we
had
some
delays
he
answered
once
we
thought
we
were
arrested
arrested
she
exclaimed
and
others
took
up
the
word
crying
oh
ollie
tell
us
about
it
oliver
told
the
tale
and
meantime
his
brother
had
a
chance
to
look
about
him
all
of
the
party
were
young
he
judged
that
he
was
the
oldest
person
there
they
were
not
of
the
flashily
dressed
sort
but
no
one
would
have
had
to
look
twice
to
know
that
there
was
money
in
the
crowd
they
had
had
their
first
round
of
drinks
and
started
in
to
enjoy
themselves
they
were
all
intimates
calling
each
other
by
their
first
names
montague
noticed
that
these
names
always
ended
in
ie
there
was
robbie
and
freddie
and
auggie
and
clarrie
and
bertie
and
chappie
if
their
names
could
not
be
made
to
end
properly
they
had
nicknames
instead
ollie
told
how
they
had
distanced
the
policeman
and
clarrie
mason
one
of
the
younger
sons
of
the
once
mighty
railroad
king
told
of
a
similar
feat
which
his
car
had
performed
and
then
the
young
lady
who
sat
beside
him
told
how
a
fat
irish
woman
had
skipped
out
of
their
way
as
they
rounded
a
corner
and
stood
and
cursed
them
from
the
of
the
sidewalk
the
waiter
came
with
the
liquor
and
montague
thanked
his
neighbour
miss
price
anabel
price
was
her
name
and
they
called
her
billy
she
was
a
tall
and
splendidly
formed
creature
and
he
learned
in
due
time
that
she
was
a
famous
athlete
she
must
have
divined
that
he
would
feel
a
little
lost
in
this
crowd
of
intimates
and
set
to
work
to
make
him
feel
at
home
an
attempt
in
which
she
was
not
altogether
successful
they
were
bound
for
a
and
so
she
asked
him
if
he
were
fond
of
shooting
he
replied
that
he
was
in
answer
to
a
further
question
he
said
that
he
had
hunted
chiefly
deer
and
wild
turkey
ah
then
you
are
a
real
hunter
said
miss
price
i
afraid
you
scorn
our
way
what
do
you
do
he
inquired
wait
and
you
see
replied
she
and
added
casually
when
you
get
to
be
pally
with
us
you
conclude
we
do
furnish
montague
jaw
dropped
just
a
little
he
recovered
himself
however
and
said
that
he
presumed
so
or
that
he
trusted
not
afterward
when
he
had
made
inquiries
and
found
out
what
he
should
have
said
he
had
completely
forgotten
what
he
had
down
in
a
hotel
in
natchez
there
was
an
old
to
whom
montague
had
once
appealed
to
seat
him
next
to
a
friend
at
the
next
meal
learning
that
the
request
had
been
granted
he
said
to
the
old
man
i
afraid
you
have
shown
me
partiality
to
which
the
reply
came
i
always
tries
to
show
it
as
much
as
i
kin
montague
always
thought
of
this
whenever
he
recalled
his
first
encounter
with
billy
price
the
young
lady
on
the
other
side
of
him
now
remarked
that
robbie
was
ordering
another
lunch
he
inquired
what
sort
of
a
lunch
that
was
she
told
him
that
robbie
called
it
a
digestion
exercise
that
was
the
only
remark
that
miss
de
millo
addressed
to
him
during
the
meal
miss
gladys
de
mille
the
banker
daughter
known
as
baby
to
her
intimates
she
was
a
stout
and
girl
who
devoted
herself
strictly
to
the
business
of
lunching
and
montague
noticed
at
the
end
that
she
was
breathing
rather
hard
and
that
her
big
round
eyes
seemed
bigger
than
ever
conversation
was
general
about
the
table
but
it
was
not
easy
conversation
to
follow
it
consisted
mostly
of
what
is
known
as
joshing
and
involved
acquaintance
with
intimate
details
of
personalities
and
past
events
also
there
was
a
great
deal
of
slang
used
which
kept
a
stranger
wits
on
the
jump
however
montague
concluded
that
all
his
deficiencies
were
made
up
for
by
his
brother
whose
sallies
were
the
cause
of
the
loudest
laughter
just
now
he
seemed
to
the
other
more
like
the
oliver
he
had
known
of
old
for
montague
had
already
noted
a
change
in
him
at
home
there
had
never
been
any
end
to
his
gaiety
and
fun
and
it
was
hard
to
get
him
to
take
anything
seriously
but
now
he
kept
all
his
jokes
for
company
and
when
he
was
alone
he
was
in
deadly
earnest
apparently
he
was
working
hard
over
his
pleasures
montague
could
understand
how
this
was
possible
some
one
for
instance
had
worked
hard
over
the
ordering
of
the
lunch
to
secure
the
maximum
of
explosive
effect
it
began
with
moulded
in
fancy
shapes
and
then
buried
in
white
of
egg
and
baked
brown
then
there
was
a
turtle
soup
thick
and
green
and
greasy
and
then
horror
of
horrors
a
great
steaming
it
was
served
in
a
strange
phenomenon
of
a
platter
with
six
long
silver
legs
and
the
waiter
set
it
in
front
of
robbie
walling
and
lifted
the
cover
with
a
sweeping
gesture
and
then
removed
it
and
served
it
himself
montague
had
about
made
up
his
mind
that
this
was
the
end
and
begun
to
fill
up
on
when
there
appeared
cold
asparagus
served
in
individual
silver
holders
resembling
andirons
then
appetite
now
being
sufficiently
whetted
there
came
quail
in
piping
hot
little
casseroles
and
then
half
a
set
in
a
block
of
ice
and
filled
with
wine
and
then
little
squab
ducklings
bursting
fat
and
an
artichoke
and
then
a
and
then
as
if
to
crown
the
audacity
huge
thick
slices
of
roast
beef
montague
had
given
up
long
ago
he
could
keep
no
track
of
the
deluge
of
food
which
poured
forth
and
between
all
the
courses
there
were
wines
of
precious
brands
tumbled
sherry
and
port
champagne
and
claret
and
liqueur
montague
watched
poor
baby
de
mille
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
and
pitied
her
for
it
was
evident
that
she
could
not
resist
the
impulse
to
eat
whatever
was
put
before
her
and
she
was
visibly
suffering
he
wondered
whether
he
might
not
manage
to
divert
her
by
conversation
but
he
lacked
the
courage
to
make
the
attempt
the
meal
was
over
at
four
by
that
time
most
of
the
other
parties
were
far
on
their
way
to
new
york
and
the
inn
was
deserted
they
possessed
themselves
of
their
belongings
and
one
by
one
their
cars
whirled
away
toward
black
forest
montague
had
been
told
that
it
was
a
he
had
a
vision
of
some
kind
of
a
rustic
shack
and
wondered
dimly
how
so
many
people
would
be
stowed
away
when
they
turned
off
the
main
road
and
his
brother
remarked
here
we
are
he
was
surprised
to
see
a
rather
large
building
of
granite
with
an
archway
spanning
the
road
he
was
still
more
surprised
when
they
whizzed
through
and
went
on
where
are
we
going
he
asked
to
forest
said
oliver
and
what
was
that
we
passed
that
was
the
lodge
was

chapter
iv
they
ran
for
about
three
miles
upon
a
broad
macadamized
avenue
laid
straight
as
an
arrow
flight
through
the
forest
and
then
the
sound
of
the
sea
came
to
them
and
before
them
was
a
mighty
granite
pile
looming
grim
in
the
twilight
with
a
and
moat
and
four
great
castellated
towers
black
forest
was
built
in
imitation
of
a
famous
old
fortress
in
provence
only
the
fortress
had
forty
small
rooms
and
its
modern
prototype
had
seventy
large
ones
and
now
every
window
was
blazing
with
lights
a
man
does
not
let
himself
be
caught
twice
in
such
a
blunder
and
having
visited
a
which
had
cost
of
a
million
dollars
and
was
set
in
a
preserve
of
ten
thousand
acres
he
was
prepared
for
adirondack
camps
which
had
cost
half
a
million
and
newport
cottages
which
had
cost
a
million
or
two
liveried
servants
took
the
car
and
others
opened
the
door
and
took
their
coats
the
first
thing
they
saw
was
a
huge
fireplace
a
fireplace
a
dozen
feet
across
made
of
great
boulders
and
with
whole
sections
of
a
pine
tree
blazing
in
it
underfoot
was
polished
hardwood
with
skins
of
bear
and
buffalo
the
firelight
flickered
upon
shields
and
and
hung
upon
the
oaken
pillars
while
between
them
were
tapestries
picturing
the
song
of
roland
and
the
battle
of
roncesvalles
one
followed
the
pillars
of
the
great
hall
to
the
vaulted
roof
whose
glass
was
glowing
in
the
western
light
a
broad
stairway
ascended
to
the
second
floor
which
opened
upon
galleries
about
the
hall
montague
went
to
the
fire
and
stood
rubbing
his
hands
before
the
grateful
blaze
scotch
or
irish
sir
inquired
a
lackey
hovering
at
his
side
he
had
scarcely
given
his
order
when
the
door
opened
and
a
second
motor
load
of
the
party
appeared
shivering
and
rushing
for
the
fire
in
a
couple
of
minutes
they
were
all
assembled
and
roaring
with
laughter
over
baby
de
mille
account
of
how
her
car
had
run
over
a
dachshund
oh
do
you
know
she
cried
he
simply
popped
half
a
dozen
attendants
hovered
about
and
soon
the
tables
in
the
hall
were
covered
with
trays
containing
decanters
and
siphons
by
this
means
everybody
in
the
party
was
soon
warmed
up
and
then
in
groups
they
scattered
to
amuse
themselves
there
was
a
great
hall
for
indoor
tennis
and
there
were
half
a
dozen
montague
knew
neither
of
these
games
but
he
was
interested
in
watching
the
in
the
and
in
studying
the
appointments
of
this
part
of
the
building
the
tank
with
the
walls
and
floor
about
it
were
all
of
marble
there
was
a
bronze
gallery
running
about
it
from
which
one
might
gaze
into
the
green
depths
of
the
water
there
were
luxurious
for
men
and
women
with
hot
and
cold
with
rubbers
in
attendance
and
weighing
and
lifting
machines
electric
machines
for
producing
violet
rays
and
electric
for
the
drying
of
the
women
hair
he
watched
several
games
in
which
men
and
women
took
part
and
later
on
when
the
tennis
and
other
players
appeared
he
joined
them
in
a
plunge
afterward
he
entered
one
of
the
electric
elevators
and
was
escorted
to
his
room
where
he
found
his
bag
unpacked
and
his
evening
attire
laid
out
upon
the
bed
it
was
about
nine
when
the
party
went
into
the
which
opened
upon
a
granite
terrace
and
loggia
facing
the
sea
the
room
was
finished
in
some
rare
black
wood
the
name
of
which
he
did
not
know
soft
radiance
suffused
it
and
the
table
was
lighted
by
electric
candles
set
in
silver
sconces
and
veiled
by
silk
shades
it
gleamed
with
its
load
of
crystal
and
silver
set
off
by
scattered
groups
of
orchids
and
ferns
the
repast
of
the
afternoon
had
been
simply
a
lunch
it
seemed
and
now
they
had
an
elaborate
dinner
prepared
by
robbie
walling
famous
chef
in
contrast
with
the
uproar
of
the
inn
was
the
cloistral
stillness
of
this
where
the
impassive
footmen
seemed
to
move
on
padded
slippers
and
the
courses
appeared
and
vanished
as
if
by
magic
montague
did
his
best
to
accustom
himself
to
the
gowns
of
the
women
which
were
cut
lower
than
any
he
had
ever
seen
in
his
life
but
he
hesitated
every
time
he
turned
to
speak
to
the
young
lady
beside
him
because
he
could
look
so
deep
down
into
her
bosom
and
it
was
difficult
for
him
to
realize
that
she
did
not
mind
it
the
conversation
was
the
same
as
before
except
that
it
was
a
little
more
general
and
louder
in
tone
for
the
guests
had
become
more
intimate
and
as
robbie
walling
wines
of
priceless
vintage
poured
forth
they
became
a
little
high
the
young
lady
who
sat
on
montague
right
was
a
miss
vincent
a
granddaughter
of
one
of
the
she
was
and
slender
and
had
appeared
at
a
recent
lawn
fete
in
the
costume
of
an
indian
maiden
the
company
amused
itself
by
selecting
an
indian
name
for
her
all
sorts
of
absurd
ones
were
suggested
depending
upon
various
intimate
details
of
the
young
lady
personality
and
habits
robbie
caused
a
laugh
by
suggesting
little
dewdrop
it
appeared
that
she
had
once
been
discovered
writing
a
poem
about
a
dewdrop
some
one
else
suggested
little
raindrop
and
then
ollie
brought
down
the
house
by
exclaiming
little
raindrop
in
the
a
perfect
gale
of
laughter
swept
over
the
company
and
it
must
have
been
a
minute
before
they
could
recover
their
composure
in
order
to
appreciate
the
humour
of
the
sally
it
was
necessary
to
know
that
miss
vincent
had
come
a
cropper
at
the
last
meet
of
the
long
island
hunt
club
and
been
extricated
from
a
slough
several
feet
deep
this
was
explained
to
montague
by
the
young
lady
on
his
left
the
one
whose
condition
caused
his
embarrassment
she
was
only
about
twenty
with
a
wealth
of
golden
hair
and
the
bright
innocent
face
of
a
child
he
had
not
yet
learned
her
name
for
every
one
called
her
cherub
not
long
after
this
she
made
a
remark
across
the
table
to
baby
de
mille
a
strange
jumble
of
syllables
which
sounded
like
english
yet
was
not
miss
de
mille
replied
and
several
joined
in
until
there
was
quite
a
conversation
going
on
cherub
explained
to
him
that
baby
had
invented
a
secret
language
made
by
transposing
letters
and
that
ollie
and
bertie
were
crazy
to
guess
the
key
to
it
and
could
not
the
dinner
lasted
until
late
the
continued
to
be
emptied
and
to
be
magically
filled
again
the
laughter
was
louder
and
now
and
then
there
were
snatches
of
singing
women
lolled
about
in
their
beautiful
boy
sat
gazing
dreamily
across
the
table
at
montague
now
and
then
closing
his
eyes
and
opening
them
more
and
more
reluctantly
the
attendants
moved
about
impassive
and
silent
as
ever
no
one
else
seemed
to
be
cognizant
of
their
existence
but
montague
could
not
help
noticing
them
and
wondering
what
they
thought
of
it
all
when
at
last
the
party
broke
up
it
was
because
the
wished
to
get
settled
for
the
evening
the
others
gathered
in
front
of
the
fireplace
and
smoked
and
chatted
at
home
when
one
planned
a
day
hunting
he
went
to
bed
early
and
rose
before
dawn
but
here
it
seemed
there
was
game
and
the
hunters
had
nothing
to
consider
save
their
own
comfort
the
cards
were
played
in
the
vaulted
montague
strolled
through
it
and
his
eye
ran
down
the
wall
lined
with
glass
cases
and
filled
with
every
sort
of
firearm
known
to
the
hunter
he
recalled
with
a
twinge
of
that
he
had
suggested
bringing
his
shotgun
along
he
joined
a
group
in
one
corner
and
lounged
in
the
shadows
and
studied
billy
price
whose
conversation
had
so
mystified
him
billy
whose
father
was
a
banker
proved
to
be
a
devotee
of
horses
she
was
a
veritable
amazon
the
one
passion
of
whose
life
was
glory
seeing
her
sitting
in
this
group
smoking
cigarettes
and
drinking
highballs
and
listening
impassively
to
risqué
stories
one
might
easily
draw
base
conclusions
about
billy
price
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
was
made
of
marble
and
the
men
instead
of
falling
in
love
with
her
made
her
their
confidante
and
told
her
their
troubles
and
sought
her
sympathy
and
advice
some
of
this
was
explained
to
montague
by
a
young
lady
who
as
the
evening
wore
on
came
in
and
placed
herself
beside
him
my
name
is
betty
wyman
she
said
and
you
and
i
will
have
to
be
friends
because
ollie
my
side
partner
montague
had
to
meet
her
advances
so
had
not
much
time
to
speculate
as
to
what
the
term
side
partner
might
be
supposed
to
convey
betty
was
a
radiant
little
creature
dressed
in
a
robe
of
deep
crimson
made
of
some
soft
and
filmy
and
complicated
material
there
was
a
crimson
rose
in
her
hair
and
a
living
glow
of
crimson
in
her
cheeks
she
was
bright
and
quick
like
a
butterfly
full
of
strange
whims
and
impulses
mischievous
lights
gleamed
in
her
eyes
and
mischievous
smiles
played
about
her
adorable
little
cherry
lips
some
strange
perfume
haunted
the
filmy
dress
and
completed
the
bewilderment
of
the
intended
victim
i
have
a
letter
of
introduction
to
a
wyman
in
new
york
said
montague
perhaps
he
is
a
relative
of
yours
is
he
a
railroad
president
asked
she
and
when
he
answered
in
the
affirmative
is
he
a
railroad
king
she
whispered
in
a
mocking
voice
is
he
rich
oh
rich
as
solomon
and
is
he
a
terrible
man
who
eats
people
alive
all
the
time
yes
said
montague
that
must
be
the
one
well
said
betty
he
has
done
me
the
honour
to
be
my
granddaddy
but
do
you
take
any
letter
of
introduction
to
him
why
not
asked
he
perplexed
because
he
eat
you
said
the
girl
he
hates
ollie
dear
me
said
the
other
and
the
girl
asked
do
you
mean
that
the
boy
has
said
a
word
about
me
no
said
montague
i
suppose
he
left
it
for
you
to
do
well
said
betty
it
like
a
fairy
story
do
you
ever
read
fairy
stories
in
this
story
there
was
a
princess
oh
the
most
beautiful
princess
do
you
understand
yes
said
montague
she
wore
a
red
rose
in
her
hair
and
then
said
the
girl
there
was
a
young
courtier
very
handsome
and
gay
and
they
fell
in
love
with
each
other
but
the
terrible
old
king
he
wanted
his
daughter
to
wait
a
while
until
he
got
through
conquering
his
enemies
so
that
he
might
have
time
to
pick
out
some
prince
or
other
or
maybe
some
ogre
who
was
wasting
his
lands
do
you
follow
me
perfectly
said
he
and
then
did
the
beautiful
princess
pine
away
um
no
said
betty
pursing
her
lips
but
she
had
to
dance
terribly
hard
to
keep
from
thinking
about
herself
then
she
laughed
and
exclaimed
dear
me
we
are
getting
poetical
and
next
looking
sober
again
do
you
know
i
was
half
afraid
to
talk
to
you
ollie
tells
me
you
terribly
serious
are
you
i
do
know
said
montague
but
she
broke
in
with
a
laugh
we
were
talking
about
you
at
dinner
last
night
they
had
some
whipped
cream
done
up
in
funny
little
curliques
and
ollie
said
if
my
brother
allan
were
here
he
be
thinking
about
the
man
who
fixed
this
cream
and
how
long
it
took
him
and
how
he
might
have
been
reading
the
simple
life
is
that
true
it
involves
a
question
of
literary
criticism
said
montague
i
do
want
to
talk
about
literature
exclaimed
the
other
in
truth
she
wanted
nothing
save
to
feel
of
his
armour
and
find
out
if
there
were
any
weak
spots
through
which
he
could
be
teased
montague
was
to
find
in
time
that
the
adorable
miss
elizabeth
was
a
very
thorny
species
of
rose
she
was
more
like
a
wasp
of
predatory
temperament
ollie
says
you
want
to
go
down
town
and
work
she
went
on
i
think
you
awfully
foolish
is
it
much
nicer
to
spend
your
time
in
an
imitation
castle
like
this
perhaps
said
he
but
i
have
any
castle
you
might
get
one
answered
betty
stay
around
awhile
and
let
us
marry
you
to
a
nice
girl
they
will
all
throw
themselves
at
your
feet
you
know
for
you
have
such
a
delicious
melting
voice
and
you
look
romantic
and
exciting
montague
made
a
note
to
inquire
whether
it
was
customary
in
new
york
to
talk
about
you
so
frankly
to
your
face
miss
betty
was
surveying
him
quizzically
meantime
i
do
know
she
said
on
second
thoughts
maybe
you
frighten
the
girls
then
be
the
married
women
who
fall
in
love
with
you
you
have
to
watch
out
i
already
been
told
that
by
my
tailor
said
montague
with
a
laugh
that
would
be
a
still
quicker
way
of
making
your
fortune
said
she
but
i
do
think
you
fit
in
the
rôle
of
a
tame
cat
a
he
exclaimed
and
miss
betty
laughed
do
you
know
what
that
is
dear
me
how
charmingly
naive
but
perhaps
you
better
get
ollie
to
explain
for
you
that
brought
the
conversation
to
the
subject
of
slang
and
montague
in
a
sudden
burst
of
confidence
asked
for
an
interpretation
of
miss
price
cryptic
utterance
she
said
he
repeated
slowly
that
when
i
got
to
be
pally
with
her
i
conclude
she
did
furnish
oh
yes
said
miss
wyman
she
just
meant
that
when
you
knew
her
you
be
disappointed
you
see
she
picks
up
all
the
slang
one
ca
help
it
you
know
and
last
year
she
took
her
coach
over
to
england
and
so
she
got
all
the
english
slang
that
makes
it
hard
even
for
us
and
then
betty
sailed
in
to
entertain
him
with
little
sketches
of
other
members
of
the
party
a
phenomenon
that
had
struck
montague
immediately
was
the
extraordinary
freedom
with
which
everybody
in
new
york
discussed
everybody
else
as
a
matter
of
fact
one
seldom
discussed
anything
else
and
it
made
not
the
least
difference
though
the
person
were
one
of
your
set
though
he
ate
your
bread
and
salt
and
you
ate
his
still
you
would
amuse
yourself
by
pouring
forth
the
most
painful
and
humiliating
and
terrifying
things
about
him
there
was
poor
clarrie
mason
clarrie
sitting
in
at
bridge
with
an
expression
of
feverish
eagerness
upon
his
pale
face
clarrie
always
lost
and
it
positively
broke
his
heart
though
he
had
ten
millions
laid
by
on
ice
clarrie
went
about
all
day
bemoaning
his
brother
who
had
been
kidnapped
had
montague
not
heard
about
it
well
the
newspapers
called
it
a
marriage
but
it
was
really
a
kidnapping
poor
larry
mason
was
and
weak
in
the
knees
and
he
had
been
carried
off
by
a
terrible
creature
three
times
as
big
as
himself
and
with
a
temper
like
oh
there
were
no
words
for
it
she
had
been
an
actress
and
now
she
had
carried
larry
away
in
her
talons
and
was
building
a
big
castle
to
keep
him
in
for
he
had
ten
millions
too
alas
and
then
there
was
bertie
stuyvesant
beautiful
and
winning
the
boy
who
had
sat
opposite
montague
at
dinner
bertie
father
had
been
a
coal
man
and
nobody
knew
how
many
millions
he
had
left
bertie
was
gay
last
week
he
had
invited
them
to
a
breakfast
in
november
and
that
had
been
a
lark
somebody
had
told
him
that
trout
never
really
tasted
good
unless
you
caught
them
yourself
and
bertie
had
suddenly
resolved
to
catch
them
for
that
breakfast
they
have
a
big
preserve
up
in
the
adirondacks
said
betty
and
bertie
ordered
his
private
train
and
he
and
chappie
de
peyster
and
some
others
started
that
night
they
drove
i
do
know
how
many
miles
the
next
day
and
caught
a
pile
of
trout
and
we
had
them
for
breakfast
the
next
morning
the
best
joke
of
all
is
that
chappie
vows
they
were
so
full
they
could
fish
and
that
the
trout
were
caught
with
nets
poor
bertie
somebody
have
to
separate
him
from
that
decanter
now
from
the
hall
there
came
loud
laughter
with
sounds
of
scuffling
and
cries
let
me
have
it
that
baby
de
mille
said
miss
wyman
she
always
wanting
to
it
robbie
was
mad
the
last
time
she
was
down
here
she
got
to
throwing
and
upset
a
vase
is
that
supposed
to
be
good
form
asked
montague
not
at
robbie
said
she
have
you
had
a
chance
to
talk
with
robbie
yet
you
like
him
he
serious
like
you
what
he
serious
about
about
spending
his
money
said
betty
that
the
only
thing
he
has
to
be
serious
about
has
he
got
so
very
much
thirty
or
forty
millions
she
replied
but
then
you
see
a
lot
of
it
in
the
inner
companies
of
his
railroad
system
and
it
pays
him
fabulously
and
his
wife
has
money
too
she
was
a
miss
mason
you
know
her
father
one
of
the
steel
crowd
we
a
saying
that
there
are
millionaires
and
then
and
then
pittsburg
millionaires
anyhow
the
two
of
them
spend
all
their
income
in
entertaining
it
robbie
fad
to
play
the
perfect
host
he
likes
to
have
lots
of
people
round
him
he
does
put
up
good
times
only
he
so
very
important
about
it
and
he
has
so
many
ideas
of
what
is
proper
i
guess
most
of
his
set
would
rather
go
to
jack
warden
any
day
i
be
there
if
it
had
been
for
ollie
who
jack
warden
asked
montague
have
you
ever
heard
of
her
said
betty
she
used
to
be
van
ambridge
and
then
she
got
a
divorce
and
married
warden
the
big
lumber
man
she
used
to
give
and
girl
parties
in
the
english
fashion
and
when
we
went
there
we
do
as
we
please
play
tag
all
over
the
house
and
have
and
ransack
the
closets
and
get
up
masquerades
mrs
warden
as
as
an
old
cow
you
meet
her
sometime
only
do
you
let
her
fool
you
with
those
soft
eyes
of
hers
you
find
she
does
mean
it
it
just
that
she
likes
to
have
handsome
men
hanging
round
her
at
one
a
few
of
robbie
guests
went
to
bed
montague
among
them
he
left
two
tables
of
bridge
fiends
sitting
immobile
the
women
with
flushed
faces
and
feverish
hands
and
the
men
with
cigarettes
dangling
from
their
lips
there
were
trays
and
decanters
beside
each
and
in
the
hall
he
passed
three
youths
staggering
about
in
each
other
arms
and
feebly
singing
snatches
of
coon
songs
ollie
and
betty
had
strolled
away
together
to
parts
unknown
montague
had
entered
his
name
in
the
to
be
called
at
nine
the
man
who
awakened
him
brought
him
coffee
and
cream
upon
a
silver
tray
and
asked
him
if
he
would
have
anything
stronger
he
was
privileged
to
have
his
breakfast
in
his
room
if
he
wished
but
he
went
downstairs
trying
his
best
to
feel
natural
in
his
elaborate
hunting
costume
no
one
else
had
appeared
yet
but
he
found
the
traces
of
last
night
cleared
away
and
breakfast
ready
served
in
english
fashion
with
urns
of
tea
and
coffee
upon
the
buffet
the
grave
butler
and
his
satellites
were
in
attendance
ready
to
take
his
order
for
anything
else
under
the
sun
that
he
fancied
montague
preferred
to
go
for
a
stroll
upon
the
terrace
and
to
watch
the
sunlight
sparkling
upon
the
sea
the
morning
was
beautiful
everything
about
the
place
was
so
beautiful
that
he
wondered
how
men
and
women
could
live
here
and
not
feel
the
spell
of
it
billy
price
came
down
shortly
afterward
clad
in
a
khaki
hunting
suit
with
knee
kilts
and
and
and
cossack
she
joined
him
in
a
stroll
down
the
beach
and
talked
to
him
about
the
coming
winter
season
with
its
leading
personalities
and
events
the
horse
show
which
opened
next
week
and
the
prospects
for
the
opera
and
de
graffenried
opening
entertainment
when
they
came
back
it
was
eleven
and
they
found
most
of
the
guests
assembled
nearly
all
of
them
looking
a
little
pale
and
uncomfortable
in
the
merciless
morning
light
as
the
two
came
in
they
observed
bertie
stuyvesant
standing
by
the
buffet
in
the
act
of
gulping
down
a
tumbler
of
brandy
bertie
has
taken
up
the
breakfast
fad
said
billy
with
an
ironical
smile
then
began
the
hunt
the
equipment
of
black
forest
included
a
granite
building
and
elaborately
fitted
in
which
an
english
expert
and
his
assistants
raised
imported
pheasants
magnificent
birds
with
long
floating
black
tails
just
before
the
opening
of
the
season
they
were
dumped
by
thousands
into
the
covers
fat
and
almost
tame
enough
to
be
fed
by
hand
and
now
came
the
hunters
first
they
drew
lots
for
they
were
to
hunt
in
pairs
a
man
and
a
woman
montague
drew
miss
vincent
little
raindrop
in
the
then
ollie
who
was
master
of
ceremonies
placed
them
in
a
long
line
and
gave
them
the
direction
and
at
a
signal
they
moved
through
the
forest
following
each
person
were
two
attendants
to
carry
the
extra
guns
and
reload
them
and
out
in
front
were
men
to
beat
the
bushes
and
scare
the
birds
into
flight
now
montague
idea
of
hunting
had
been
to
steal
through
the
bayou
forests
and
match
his
eyes
against
those
of
the
wild
turkey
and
shoot
off
their
heads
with
a
rifle
bullet
so
when
one
of
these
birds
rose
in
front
of
him
he
fired
and
the
bird
dropped
and
he
could
have
done
it
for
ever
he
judged
only
it
was
stupid
slaughter
and
it
sickened
him
however
if
the
creatures
were
not
shot
they
must
inevitably
perish
in
the
winter
snows
and
he
had
heard
that
robbie
sent
the
game
to
the
hospitals
also
the
score
was
being
kept
and
miss
vincent
who
was
something
of
a
shot
herself
was
watching
him
with
eager
excitement
being
wild
with
desire
to
beat
out
billy
price
and
chappie
de
peyster
who
were
the
champion
shots
of
the
company
baby
de
mille
who
was
on
his
left
and
who
could
not
shoot
at
all
was
blundering
along
puffing
for
breath
and
eyeing
him
enviously
and
the
attendants
at
his
back
were
trembling
with
delight
and
murmuring
their
applause
so
he
shot
on
as
long
as
the
drive
lasted
and
again
on
their
way
back
over
a
new
stretch
of
the
country
sometimes
the
birds
would
rise
in
pairs
and
he
would
drop
them
both
and
twice
when
a
blundering
flock
took
flight
in
his
direction
he
seized
a
second
gun
and
brought
down
a
second
pair
when
the
day
sport
came
to
an
end
his
score
was
fifteen
better
than
his
nearest
competitor
and
he
and
his
partner
had
won
the
day
they
crowded
round
to
congratulate
him
first
his
partner
and
then
his
rivals
and
his
host
and
hostess
montague
found
that
he
had
suddenly
become
a
person
of
consequence
some
who
had
previously
taken
no
notice
of
him
now
became
aware
of
his
existence
proud
society
belles
condescended
to
make
conversation
with
him
and
clarrie
mason
who
hated
de
peyster
made
note
of
a
way
to
annoy
him
as
for
oliver
he
was
radiant
with
delight
when
it
came
to
horses
and
guns
i
knew
you
make
good
he
whispered
leaving
the
game
to
be
gathered
up
in
carts
they
made
their
way
home
and
there
the
two
victors
received
their
prizes
the
man
consisted
of
a
shaving
set
in
a
case
of
solid
gold
set
with
diamonds
montague
was
simply
stunned
for
the
thing
could
not
have
cost
less
than
one
or
two
thousand
dollars
he
could
not
persuade
himself
that
he
had
a
right
to
accept
of
such
hospitality
which
he
could
never
hope
to
return
he
was
to
realize
in
time
that
robbie
lived
for
the
pleasure
of
thus
humiliating
his
after
luncheon
the
party
came
to
an
end
some
set
out
to
return
as
they
had
come
and
others
who
had
dinner
engagements
went
back
with
their
host
in
his
private
car
leaving
their
autos
to
be
returned
by
the
chauffeurs
montague
and
his
brother
were
among
these
and
about
dusk
when
the
swarms
of
working
people
were
pouring
out
of
the
city
they
crossed
the
ferry
and
took
a
cab
to
their
hotel
chapter
v
they
found
their
apartments
looking
as
if
they
had
been
struck
by
a
storm
of
red
and
green
and
yellow
and
all
the
colours
that
lie
between
all
day
the
wagons
of
fashionable
milliners
and
costumiers
had
been
stopping
at
the
door
and
their
contents
had
found
their
way
to
alice
room
the
floors
were
in
tissue
paper
and
tape
and
beds
and
couches
and
chairs
were
covered
with
boxes
in
which
lay
wonderful
symphonies
of
colour
half
disclosed
in
their
wrappings
of
gauze
in
the
midst
of
it
all
stood
the
girl
her
eyes
shining
with
excitement
oh
allan
she
cried
as
they
entered
how
am
i
ever
to
thank
you
you
not
to
thank
me
montague
replied
this
is
all
doings
oliver
exclaimed
the
girl
and
turned
to
him
how
in
the
world
could
you
do
it
she
cried
how
will
you
ever
get
the
money
to
pay
for
it
all
that
my
problem
said
the
man
laughing
all
you
have
to
think
about
is
to
look
beautiful
if
i
do
was
her
reply
it
wo
be
for
lack
of
clothes
i
never
saw
so
many
wonderful
things
in
all
my
life
as
i
seen
there
quite
a
show
of
them
admitted
oliver
and
reggie
mann
it
was
so
queer
allan
i
never
went
shopping
with
a
man
before
and
he
so
so
you
know
he
bought
me
everything
that
was
what
he
was
told
to
do
said
oliver
did
you
like
him
i
do
know
said
the
girl
he
queer
i
never
met
a
man
like
that
before
but
he
was
awfully
kind
and
the
people
just
turned
their
stores
inside
out
for
us
half
a
dozen
people
hurrying
about
to
wait
on
you
at
once
you
get
used
to
such
things
said
oliver
and
then
stepping
toward
the
bed
let
see
what
you
got
most
of
the
things
have
come
said
alice
the
gowns
all
have
to
be
that
one
is
for
she
added
as
he
lifted
up
a
beautiful
object
made
of
chiffon
oliver
studied
it
and
glanced
once
or
twice
at
the
girl
i
guess
you
can
carry
it
he
said
what
sort
of
a
cloak
are
you
to
wear
oh
the
cloak
cried
alice
oliver
i
ca
believe
it
really
to
belong
to
me
i
did
know
anyone
but
princesses
wore
such
things
the
cloak
was
in
montague
room
and
one
of
the
maids
brought
it
in
it
was
an
of
grey
brocade
lined
with
unborn
baby
lamb
a
thing
of
a
gorgeousness
that
made
montague
literally
gasp
for
breath
did
you
ever
see
anything
like
it
in
your
life
cried
alice
and
oliver
is
it
true
that
i
have
to
have
gloves
and
shoes
and
stockings
and
a
hat
to
match
every
gown
of
course
said
oliver
if
you
were
doing
things
right
you
ought
to
have
a
cloak
to
match
each
evening
gown
as
well
it
seems
incredible
said
the
girl
can
it
be
right
to
spend
so
much
money
for
things
to
wear
but
oliver
was
not
discussing
questions
of
ethics
he
was
examining
sets
of
tinted
crepe
de
chine
lingerie
and
hose
of
spun
silk
there
were
boxes
upon
boxes
and
bureau
drawers
and
closet
shelves
already
filled
up
with
and
and
of
handkerchief
linen
lawn
lace
handkerchiefs
and
veils
corsets
of
french
coutil
of
silks
and
negligees
of
soft
batistes
trimmed
with
valenciennes
lace
or
even
with
fur
you
must
have
put
in
a
full
day
he
said
i
never
looked
at
so
many
things
in
my
life
said
alice
and
mann
never
stopped
to
ask
the
price
of
a
thing
i
did
think
to
tell
him
to
said
oliver
laughing
then
the
girl
went
in
to
dress
and
oliver
faced
about
to
find
his
brother
sitting
and
staring
hard
at
him
tell
me
montague
exclaimed
in
god
name
what
is
all
this
to
cost
i
do
know
said
oliver
impassively
i
have
seen
the
bills
it
be
fifteen
or
twenty
thousand
i
guess
montague
hands
clenched
involuntarily
and
he
sat
rigid
how
long
will
it
all
last
her
he
asked
why
said
the
other
when
she
gets
enough
it
last
her
until
spring
of
course
unless
she
goes
south
during
the
winter
how
much
is
it
going
to
take
to
dress
her
for
a
year
i
suppose
thirty
or
forty
thousand
was
the
reply
i
do
expect
to
keep
count
montague
sat
in
silence
you
do
want
to
shut
her
up
and
keep
her
at
home
do
you
inquired
his
brother
at
last
do
you
mean
that
other
women
spend
that
much
on
clothes
he
demanded
of
course
said
oliver
hundreds
of
them
some
spend
fifty
thousand
i
know
several
who
go
over
a
hundred
it
monstrous
montague
exclaimed
fiddlesticks
was
the
other
response
why
thousands
of
people
live
by
it
would
know
anything
else
to
do
montague
said
nothing
to
that
can
you
afford
to
have
alice
compete
with
such
women
indefinitely
he
asked
i
have
no
idea
of
her
doing
it
indefinitely
was
oliver
reply
i
simply
propose
to
give
her
a
chance
when
she
married
her
bills
will
be
paid
by
her
husband
oh
said
the
other
then
this
layout
is
just
for
her
to
be
exhibited
in
you
may
say
that
answered
oliver
if
you
want
to
be
foolish
you
know
perfectly
well
that
parents
who
launch
their
daughters
in
society
do
figure
on
keeping
up
the
pace
all
their
lifetimes
we
had
thought
of
marrying
alice
off
said
montague
to
which
his
brother
replied
that
the
best
physicians
left
all
they
could
to
nature
suppose
said
he
that
we
just
introduce
her
in
the
right
set
and
turn
her
loose
and
let
her
enjoy
herself
and
then
cross
the
next
bridge
when
we
come
to
it
montague
sat
with
knitted
brows
pondering
he
was
beginning
to
see
a
little
daylight
now
oliver
he
asked
suddenly
are
you
sure
the
stakes
in
this
game
are
too
big
how
do
you
mean
asked
the
other
will
you
be
able
to
stay
in
until
the
until
either
alice
or
myself
begins
to
bring
in
some
returns
never
worry
about
that
said
the
other
with
a
laugh
but
had
you
better
take
me
into
your
confidence
montague
persisted
how
many
weeks
can
you
pay
our
rent
in
this
place
have
you
got
the
money
to
pay
for
all
these
clothes
i
got
it
laughed
the
other
but
that
does
say
i
going
to
pay
it
do
you
have
to
pay
your
bills
can
we
do
all
this
upon
credit
oliver
laughed
again
you
go
at
me
like
a
prosecuting
attorney
he
said
i
afraid
you
have
to
inquire
around
and
learn
some
respect
for
your
brother
then
he
added
seriously
you
see
allan
people
like
reggie
or
myself
are
in
position
to
bring
a
great
deal
of
custom
to
tradespeople
and
so
they
are
willing
to
go
out
of
their
way
to
oblige
us
and
we
have
commissions
of
all
sorts
coming
to
us
so
never
any
question
of
cash
oh
exclaimed
the
other
opening
his
eyes
i
see
is
that
the
way
you
make
money
it
one
of
the
ways
we
save
it
said
oliver
it
comes
to
the
same
thing
do
people
know
it
why
of
course
why
not
i
do
know
said
montague
it
sounds
a
little
queer
nothing
of
the
kind
said
oliver
some
of
the
best
people
in
new
york
do
it
strangers
come
to
the
city
and
they
want
to
go
to
the
right
places
and
they
ask
me
and
i
send
them
or
take
robbie
walling
who
keeps
up
five
or
six
establishments
and
spends
several
millions
a
year
he
ca
see
to
it
all
personally
if
he
did
he
never
do
anything
else
why
should
he
ask
a
friend
to
attend
to
things
for
him
or
again
a
new
shop
opens
and
they
want
walling
trade
for
the
sake
of
the
advertising
and
they
offer
her
a
discount
and
me
a
commission
why
should
i
get
her
to
try
them
it
quite
intricate
commented
the
other
the
stores
have
more
than
one
price
then
they
have
as
many
prices
as
they
have
customers
was
the
answer
why
should
they
new
york
is
full
of
raw
rich
people
who
value
things
by
what
they
pay
and
why
should
they
pay
high
and
be
happy
that
that
alice
has
reval
promised
it
to
me
for
two
thousand
and
i
wager
you
she
charge
some
woman
from
butte
montana
hundred
for
one
just
like
it
montague
got
up
suddenly
stop
he
said
waving
his
hands
you
take
all
the
bloom
off
the
butterfly
wings
he
asked
where
they
were
going
that
evening
and
oliver
said
that
they
were
invited
to
an
informal
at
winnie
duval
winnie
was
the
young
widow
who
had
recently
married
the
founder
of
the
great
of
puval
and
so
oliver
explained
she
was
a
chum
of
his
and
they
would
meet
an
interesting
set
there
she
was
going
to
invite
her
cousin
charlie
carter
she
wanted
him
to
meet
alice
winnie
always
plotting
to
get
charlie
to
settle
down
said
oliver
with
a
merry
laugh
he
telephoned
for
his
man
to
bring
over
his
clothes
and
he
and
his
brother
dressed
then
alice
came
in
looking
like
the
goddess
of
the
dawn
in
the
gorgeous
gown
the
colour
in
her
cheeks
was
even
brighter
than
usual
for
she
was
staggered
to
find
how
low
the
gown
was
cut
and
was
afraid
she
was
committing
a
faux
pas
tell
me
about
it
she
stammered
mammy
lucy
says
i
surely
supposed
to
wear
some
lace
or
a
bouquet
mammy
lucy
is
a
paris
costumier
said
oliver
much
amused
dear
me
wait
until
you
have
seen
mrs
winnie
winnie
had
kindly
sent
her
limousine
car
for
them
and
it
stood
throbbing
in
front
of
the
its
acetylenes
streaming
far
up
the
street
winnie
home
was
on
fifth
avenue
fronting
the
park
it
occupied
half
a
block
and
had
cost
two
millions
to
build
and
furnish
it
was
known
as
the
snow
palace
being
all
of
white
marble
at
the
curb
a
man
in
livery
opened
the
door
of
the
car
and
in
the
vestibule
another
man
in
livery
bowed
the
way
lined
up
just
inside
the
door
was
a
corps
of
imposing
personages
clad
in
scarlet
waistcoats
and
velvet
with
powdered
wigs
and
gold
buttons
and
gold
buckles
on
their
pumps
these
splendid
creatures
took
their
wraps
and
then
presented
to
montague
and
oliver
a
bouquet
of
flowers
upon
a
silver
salver
and
upon
another
salver
a
tiny
envelope
bearing
the
name
of
their
partner
at
this
strictly
informal
then
the
functionaries
stood
out
of
the
way
and
permitted
them
to
view
the
dazzling
splendour
of
the
entrance
hall
of
the
snow
palace
there
was
a
great
marble
staircase
running
up
from
the
centre
of
the
hall
with
a
carved
marble
gallery
above
and
a
marble
fireplace
below
to
decorate
this
mansion
a
real
palace
in
the
punjab
had
been
bought
outright
and
plundered
there
were
mosaics
of
jade
and
wonderful
black
marble
and
rare
woods
and
strange
and
perplexing
carvings
the
head
butler
stood
at
the
entrance
to
the
salon
pronouncing
their
names
and
just
inside
was
winnie
montague
never
forgot
that
first
vision
of
her
she
might
have
been
a
real
princess
out
of
the
palace
in
the
punjab
she
was
a
brunette
and
with
scarlet
lips
and
black
hair
and
eyes
she
wore
a
of
cloth
of
silver
with
white
kid
shoes
embroidered
with
jewelled
flowers
all
her
life
she
had
been
collecting
large
turquoises
and
these
she
had
made
into
a
tiara
and
a
neck
ornament
spreading
over
her
chest
and
a
stomacher
each
of
these
stones
was
mounted
with
diamonds
and
set
upon
a
slender
wire
so
as
she
moved
they
quivered
and
shimmered
and
the
effect
was
dazzling
barbaric
she
must
have
seen
that
montague
was
staggered
for
she
gave
him
a
little
extra
pressure
of
the
hand
and
said
i
so
glad
you
came
ollie
has
told
me
all
about
you
her
voice
was
soft
and
melting
not
so
forbidding
as
her
garb
montague
ran
the
gauntlet
of
the
other
guests

beautiful

the
features
of

and

hair
willie
davis
who
had
been
a
famous
and
was
now
junior
partner
in
the
and
two
young
married
couples
whose
names
montague
missed
the
name
written
on
his
card
was
alden
she
came
in
just
after
him
a
matron
of
about
fifty
of
vigorous
aspect
and
ample
figure
approaching
what
he
had
not
yet
learned
to
call
embonpoint
she
wore
brocade
as
became
a
grave
dowager
and
upon
her
ample
bosom
there
lay
an
ornament
the
size
of
a
man
hand
and
made
wholly
out
of
blazing
diamonds
the
most
imposing
affair
that
montague
had
ever
laid
eyes
upon
she
gave
him
her
hand
to
shake
and
made
no
attempt
to
disguise
the
fact
that
she
was
looking
him
over
in
the
meantime
madam
dinner
is
served
said
the
stately
butler
and
the
glittering
procession
moved
into
the
a
huge
state
apartment
finished
in
some
lustrous
wood
and
with
great
panel
paintings
illustrating
the
romaunt
de
la
rose
the
table
was
covered
with
a
cloth
of
french
embroidery
and
gleaming
with
its
load
of
crystal
and
gold
plate
at
either
end
there
were
huge
candlesticks
of
solid
gold
and
in
the
centre
a
mound
of
orchids
and
lilies
of
the
valley
matching
in
colour
the
shades
of
the
candelabra
and
the
daintily
painted
menu
cards
you
are
fortunate
in
coming
to
new
york
late
in
life
alden
was
saying
to
him
most
of
our
young
men
are
tired
out
before
they
have
sense
enough
to
enjoy
anything
take
my
advice
and
look
about
you
do
let
that
lively
brother
of
yours
set
the
pace
for
you
in
front
of
alden
there
was
a
decanter
of
scotch
whisky
will
you
have
some
she
asked
as
she
took
it
up
no
i
thank
you
said
he
and
then
wondered
if
perhaps
he
should
not
have
said
yes
as
he
watched
the
other
select
the
largest
of
the
clustered
at
her
place
and
pour
herself
out
a
generous
libation
have
you
seen
much
of
the
city
she
asked
as
she
tossed
it
off
without
as
much
as
a
quiver
of
an
eyelash
no
said
he
they
have
not
given
me
much
time
they
took
me
off
to
the
country
to
the
robert
wallings
ah
said
alden
and
montague
struggling
to
make
conversation
inquired
do
you
know
mr
walling
quite
well
said
the
other
placidly
i
used
to
be
a
walling
myself
you
know
oh
said
montague
taken
aback
and
then
added
before
you
were
married
no
said
alden
more
placidly
than
ever
before
i
was
divorced
there
was
a
dead
silence
and
montague
sat
gasping
to
catch
his
breath
then
suddenly
he
heard
a
faint
subdued
chuckle
which
grew
into
open
laughter
and
he
stole
a
glance
at
alden
and
saw
that
her
eyes
were
twinkling
and
then
he
began
to
laugh
himself
they
laughed
together
so
merrily
that
others
at
the
table
began
to
look
at
them
in
perplexity
so
the
ice
was
broken
between
them
which
filled
montague
with
a
vast
relief
but
he
was
still
dimly
touched
with
awe
for
he
realized
that
this
must
be
the
great
billy
alden
whose
engagement
to
the
duke
of
london
was
now
the
topic
of
the
whole
country
and
that
huge
diamond
ornament
must
be
part
of
alden
outfit
of
jewellery
the
great
lady
volunteered
not
to
tell
on
him
and
added
generously
that
when
he
came
to
dinner
with
her
she
would
post
him
concerning
the
company
it
awkward
for
a
stranger
i
can
understand
said
she
and
continued
grimly
when
people
get
divorces
it
sometimes
means
that
they
have
quarrelled
and
they
do
always
make
it
up
afterward
either
and
sometimes
other
people
quarrel
almost
as
bitterly
as
if
they
had
been
married
many
a
hostess
has
had
her
reputation
ruined
by
not
keeping
track
of
such
things
so
montague
made
the
discovery
that
the
great
billy
though
forbidding
of
aspect
was
when
she
chose
to
be
and
with
a
pretty
wit
she
was
a
woman
with
a
mind
of
her
own
a
character
who
had
marshalled
those
about
her
and
taken
her
place
at
the
head
of
the
column
she
had
always
counted
herself
a
personage
enough
to
do
exactly
as
she
pleased
through
the
course
of
the
dinner
she
would
take
up
the
decanter
of
scotch
and
make
a
pass
to
help
montague
and
then
when
he
declined
pour
out
imperturbably
what
she
wanted
i
do
like
your
brother
she
said
to
him
a
little
later
he
wo
last
but
he
tells
me
you
different
so
maybe
i
will
like
you
come
and
see
me
sometime
and
let
me
tell
you
what
not
to
do
in
new
york
then
montague
turned
to
talk
with
his
hostess
who
sat
on
his
right
do
you
play
bridge
asked
winnie
in
her
softest
and
most
gracious
tone
my
brother
has
given
me
a
book
to
study
from
he
answered
but
if
he
takes
me
about
day
and
night
i
do
know
how
i
to
manage
it
come
and
let
me
teach
you
said
winnie
i
mean
it
really
she
added
i
nothing
to
do
at
least
that
i
not
tired
of
only
i
do
believe
you
take
long
to
learn
all
that
i
know
are
you
a
successful
player
he
asked
sympathetically
i
do
believe
anyone
wants
me
to
learn
said
mrs
rather
come
and
get
my
money
is
that
true
major
major
venable
sat
on
her
other
hand
and
he
paused
in
the
act
of
raising
a
spoonful
of
soup
to
his
lips
and
laughed
deep
down
in
his
throat
a
queer
little
laugh
that
shook
his
fat
cheeks
and
neck
i
may
say
he
said
that
i
know
several
people
to
whom
the
status
quo
is
satisfactory
including
yourself
said
the
lady
with
a
little
moue
the
wretched
man
won
sixteen
hundred
dollars
from
me
last
night
and
he
sat
in
his
club
window
all
afternoon
just
to
have
the
pleasure
of
laughing
at
me
as
i
went
by
i
do
believe
i
play
at
all
i
going
to
make
myself
agreeable
to
montague
and
let
you
win
from
virginia
landis
for
a
change
and
then
the
major
paused
again
in
his
attack
upon
the
soup
my
dear
winnie
he
said
i
can
live
for
much
more
than
one
day
upon
sixteen
hundred
dollars
the
major
was
a
famous
and
bon
vivant
as
montague
learned
later
on
he
an
uncle
of
bobbie
walling
said
alden
in
his
ear
and
incidentally
they
hate
each
other
like
poison
that
is
so
that
i
wo
repeat
my
luckless
question
again
asked
montague
with
a
smile
oh
they
meet
said
the
other
you
would
be
supposed
to
know
that
wo
you
have
any
scotch
montague
thoughts
were
so
much
taken
up
with
the
people
at
this
repast
that
he
gave
little
thought
to
the
food
he
noticed
with
surprise
that
they
had
real
spring
lamb
it
being
the
middle
of
november
but
he
could
not
know
that
the
creatures
from
which
it
had
come
had
been
raised
in
and
fed
on
milk
with
a
spoon
and
had
cost
a
dollar
and
a
half
a
pound
a
little
later
however
there
was
placed
before
him
a
delicately
browned
sweetbread
upon
a
platter
of
gold
and
then
suddenly
he
began
to
pay
attention
winnie
had
a
coat
of
arms
he
had
noticed
it
upon
her
auto
and
again
upon
the
great
bronze
gates
of
the
snow
palace
and
again
upon
the
liveries
of
her
footmen
and
yet
again
upon
the
decanter
of
scotch
and
now
incredible
and
appalling
he
observed
it
branded
upon
the
delicately
browned
sweetbread
after
that
who
would
not
have
watched
there
were
large
dishes
of
rare
fruits
upon
the
table
fruits
which
had
been
packed
in
cotton
wool
and
shipped
in
cold
storage
from
every
corner
of
the
earth
there
were
peaches
which
had
come
from
south
africa
they
had
cost
ten
dollars
apiece
there
were
bunches
of
hamburg
grapes
dark
purple
and
bursting
fat
which
had
been
grown
in
a
wrapped
in
paper
bags
there
were
nectarines
and
plums
and
pomegranates
and
persimmons
from
japan
and
later
on
little
dishes
of
plump
in
pots
there
were
quail
which
had
come
from
egypt
and
a
wonderful
thing
called
a
la
dewey
cooked
in
a
and
served
with
mushrooms
that
had
been
grown
in
the
tunnels
of
abandoned
mines
in
michigan
there
was
lettuce
raised
by
electric
light
and
lima
beans
that
had
come
from
porto
rico
and
artichokes
brought
from
france
at
a
cost
of
one
dollar
and
all
these
extraordinary
viands
were
washed
down
by
eight
or
nine
varieties
of
wines
from
the
cellar
of
a
man
who
had
made
collecting
them
a
fad
for
the
last
thirty
years
who
had
a
vineyard
in
france
for
the
growing
of
his
own
champagne
and
kept
twenty
thousand
quarts
of
claret
in
storage
all
the
time
and
procured
his
rhine
wine
from
the
cellar
of
the
german
emperor
at
a
cost
of
dollars
a
quart
there
were
twelve
people
at
dinner
and
afterward
they
made
two
tables
for
bridge
leaving
charlie
carter
to
talk
to
alice
and
winnie
to
devote
herself
to
montague
according
to
her
promise
everybody
likes
to
see
my
house
she
said
would
you
and
she
led
the
way
from
the
into
the
great
conservatory
which
formed
a
central
court
extending
to
the
roof
of
the
building
she
pressed
a
button
and
a
soft
radiance
streamed
down
from
above
in
the
midst
of
which
winnie
stood
with
her
shimmering
jewels
a
very
goddess
of
the
fire
the
conservatory
was
a
place
in
which
he
could
have
spent
the
evening
it
was
filled
with
the
most
extraordinary
varieties
of
plants
they
were
gathered
from
all
over
the
world
said
winnie
seeing
that
he
was
staring
at
them
my
husband
employed
a
connoisseur
to
hunt
them
out
for
him
he
did
it
before
we
were
married
he
thought
it
would
make
me
happy
in
the
centre
of
the
place
there
was
a
fountain
twelve
or
fourteen
feet
in
height
and
set
in
a
basin
of
purest
carrara
marble
by
the
touch
of
a
button
the
pool
was
flooded
with
submerged
lights
and
one
might
see
scores
of
rare
and
beautiful
fish
swimming
about
is
it
fine
said
winnie
and
added
eagerly
do
you
know
i
come
here
at
night
sometimes
when
i
ca
sleep
and
sit
for
hours
and
gaze
all
those
living
things
with
their
extraordinary
of
them
have
faces
and
look
like
human
beings
and
i
wonder
what
they
think
about
and
if
life
seems
as
strange
to
them
as
it
does
to
me
she
seated
herself
by
the
edge
of
the
pool
and
gazed
in
these
fish
were
given
to
me
by
my
cousin
ned
carter
they
call
him
buzzie
have
you
met
him
yet
no
of
course
not
he
charlie
brother
and
he
collects
art
things
the
most
unbelievable
things
once
a
long
time
ago
he
took
a
fad
for
goldfish
some
goldfish
are
very
rare
and
beautiful
you
know
one
can
pay
and
fifty
dollars
apiece
for
them
he
got
all
the
dealers
had
and
when
he
learned
that
there
were
some
they
could
get
he
took
a
trip
to
japan
and
china
on
purpose
to
get
them
you
know
they
raise
them
there
and
some
of
them
are
sacred
and
not
allowed
to
be
sold
or
taken
out
of
the
country
and
he
had
all
sorts
of
carved
ivory
receptacles
for
them
that
he
brought
home
with
him
he
had
one
beautiful
marble
basin
about
ten
feet
long
that
had
been
stolen
from
the
emperor
over
montague
shoulder
where
he
sat
there
hung
an
orchid
a
most
curious
creation
an
explosion
of
scarlet
flame
that
is
the
said
winnie
have
you
heard
of
it
never
said
the
man
dear
me
said
the
other
such
is
fame
is
it
supposed
to
be
famous
he
asked
very
she
replied
there
was
a
lot
in
the
newspapers
about
it
you
see
winton
that
my
husband
you
know
paid
thousand
dollars
to
the
man
who
created
it
and
that
made
a
lot
of
foolish
talk
people
come
from
all
over
to
look
at
it
i
wanted
to
have
it
because
its
shape
is
exactly
like
the
coronet
on
my
crest
do
you
notice
that
yes
said
montague
it
curious
i
very
proud
of
my
crest
continued
winnie
of
course
there
are
vulgar
rich
people
who
have
them
made
to
order
and
make
them
ridiculous
but
ours
is
a
real
one
it
my
own
not
my
husband
the
duvals
are
an
old
french
family
but
they
not
noble
i
was
a
morris
you
know
and
our
line
runs
back
to
the
old
french
ducal
house
of
montmorenci
and
last
summer
when
we
were
motoring
i
hunted
up
one
of
their
chateaux
and
see
i
brought
over
this
winnie
pointed
to
a
suit
of
armour
placed
in
a
passage
leading
to
the
i
have
had
the
lights
fixed
she
added
and
she
pressed
a
button
and
all
illumination
vanished
save
for
a
faint
red
glow
just
above
the
man
in
armour
does
he
look
real
said
she
he
had
his
visor
down
and
a
in
his
mailed
hands
i
like
to
imagine
that
he
may
have
been
my
twentieth
i
come
and
sit
here
and
gaze
at
him
and
shiver
think
what
a
terrible
time
it
must
have
been
to
live
in
when
men
wore
things
like
that
it
could
be
any
worse
to
be
a
crab
you
seem
to
be
fond
of
strange
emotions
said
montague
laughing
maybe
i
am
said
the
other
i
like
everything
that
old
and
romantic
and
makes
you
forget
this
stupid
society
world
she
stood
brooding
for
a
moment
or
two
gazing
at
the
figure
then
she
asked
abruptly
which
do
you
like
best
pictures
or
swimming
why
replied
the
man
laughing
and
perplexed
i
like
them
both
at
times
i
wondered
which
you
rather
see
first
explained
his
escort
the
art
gallery
or
the
natatorium
i
afraid
you
get
tired
before
you
seen
every
thing
suppose
we
begin
with
the
said
he
there
not
much
to
see
in
a
ah
but
ours
is
a
very
special
one
said
the
and
some
day
if
you
be
very
good
and
promise
not
to
tell
anyone
i
let
you
see
my
own
bath
perhaps
they
told
you
i
have
one
in
my
own
apartments
cut
out
of
a
block
of
the
most
wonderful
green
marble
montague
showed
the
expected
amount
of
astonishment
of
course
that
gave
the
dreadful
newspapers
another
chance
to
gossip
said
winnie
plaintively
people
found
out
what
i
had
paid
for
it
one
ca
have
anything
beautiful
without
that
question
being
asked
and
then
followed
a
silence
while
winnie
waited
for
him
to
ask
it
as
he
forebore
to
do
so
she
added
it
was
fifty
thousand
dollars
they
were
moving
towards
the
elevator
where
a
small
boy
in
the
wonderful
livery
of
plush
and
scarlet
stood
at
attention
sometimes
she
continued
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
wicked
to
pay
such
prices
for
things
have
you
ever
thought
about
it
occasionally
montague
replied
of
course
said
she
it
makes
work
for
people
and
i
suppose
they
ca
be
better
employed
than
in
making
beautiful
things
but
sometimes
when
i
think
of
all
the
poverty
there
is
i
get
unhappy
we
have
a
winter
place
down
south
one
of
those
huge
that
look
like
exposition
buildings
and
have
rooms
for
a
hundred
guests
and
sometimes
i
go
driving
by
myself
down
to
the
mill
towns
and
go
through
them
and
talk
to
the
children
i
came
to
know
some
of
them
quite
well
poor
little
wretches
they
stepped
out
of
the
elevator
and
moved
toward
the
it
used
to
make
me
so
unhappy
she
went
on
i
tried
to
talk
to
my
husband
about
it
but
he
would
have
it
do
see
why
you
be
like
other
people
he
said
he
always
repeating
that
to
me
and
what
could
i
say
why
not
suggest
that
other
people
might
be
like
you
said
the
man
laughing
i
was
clever
enough
said
she
it
very
hard
for
a
woman
you
know
with
no
one
to
understand
once
i
went
down
to
a
settlement
to
see
what
that
was
like
do
you
know
anything
about
settlements
nothing
at
all
said
montague
well
they
are
people
who
go
to
live
among
the
poor
and
try
to
reform
them
it
takes
a
terrible
lot
of
courage
i
think
i
give
them
money
now
and
then
but
i
am
never
sure
if
it
does
any
good
the
trouble
with
poor
people
it
seems
to
me
is
that
there
are
so
many
of
them
there
are
indeed
said
montague
thinking
of
the
vision
he
had
seen
from
oliver
winnie
had
seated
herself
upon
a
cushioned
seat
near
the
entrance
to
the
darkened
gallery
i
have
been
there
for
some
time
she
continued
i
discovered
something
that
i
think
appeals
more
to
my
temperament
i
have
rather
a
leaning
toward
the
occult
and
the
mystical
i
afraid
did
you
ever
hear
of
the
babists
no
said
montague
well
that
a
religious
sect
from
persia
i
think
and
they
are
quite
the
rage
they
are
priests
you
understand
and
they
give
lectures
and
teach
you
all
about
the
immanence
of
the
divine
and
about
reincarnation
and
karma
and
all
that
do
you
believe
any
of
those
things
i
ca
say
that
i
know
about
them
said
he
it
is
very
beautiful
and
strange
added
the
other
it
makes
you
realize
what
a
perplexing
thing
life
is
they
teach
you
how
the
universe
is
all
one
and
the
soul
is
the
only
reality
and
so
bodily
things
do
matter
if
i
were
a
babist
i
believe
that
i
could
be
happy
even
if
i
had
to
work
in
a
then
winnie
rose
up
suddenly
you
rather
look
at
the
pictures
i
know
she
said
and
she
pressed
a
button
and
a
soft
radiance
flooded
the
great
vaulted
gallery
this
is
our
chief
pride
in
life
she
said
my
husband
object
has
been
to
get
one
representative
work
of
each
of
the
great
painters
of
the
world
we
got
their
masterpiece
whenever
we
could
over
there
in
the
corner
are
the
old
masters
do
you
love
to
look
at
them
montague
would
have
liked
to
look
at
them
very
much
but
he
felt
that
he
would
rather
it
were
some
time
when
he
did
not
have
winnie
by
his
side
winnie
must
have
had
to
show
the
gallery
quite
frequently
and
now
her
mind
was
still
upon
the
persian
transcendentalists
that
picture
of
the
saint
is
a
botticelli
she
said
and
do
you
know
the
robe
always
makes
me
think
of
the
swami
that
is
my
teacher
you
know
swami
babubanana
and
he
has
the
most
beautiful
delicate
hands
and
great
big
brown
eyes
so
soft
and
gentle
for
all
the
world
like
those
of
the
gazelles
in
our
place
down
south
thus
winnie
as
she
roamed
from
picture
to
picture
while
the
souls
of
the
grave
old
masters
looked
down
upon
her
in
silence
chapter
vi
montague
had
now
been
officially
pronounced
complete
by
his
tailor
and
reval
had
sent
home
the
first
of
alice
street
gowns
elaborately
plain
but
fitting
her
conspicuously
and
costing
accordingly
so
the
next
morning
they
were
ready
to
be
taken
to
call
upon
devon
of
course
montague
had
heard
of
the
devons
but
he
was
not
sufficiently
initiated
to
comprehend
just
what
it
meant
to
be
asked
to
call
but
when
oliver
came
in
a
little
before
noon
and
proceeded
to
examine
his
costume
and
to
put
him
to
rights
and
insisted
that
alice
should
have
her
hair
done
over
he
began
to
realize
that
this
was
a
special
occasion
oliver
was
in
quite
a
state
of
excitement
and
after
they
had
left
the
hotel
and
were
driving
up
the
avenue
he
explained
to
them
that
their
future
in
society
depended
upon
the
outcome
of
this
visit
calling
upon
devon
it
seemed
was
the
american
equivalent
to
being
presented
at
court
for
years
this
grand
lady
had
been
the
undisputed
mistress
of
the
society
of
the
metropolis
and
if
she
liked
them
they
would
be
invited
to
her
annual
ball
which
took
place
in
january
and
then
for
ever
after
their
position
would
be
assured
devon
ball
was
the
one
great
event
of
the
social
year
about
one
thousand
people
were
asked
while
ten
thousand
disappointed
ones
gnashed
their
teeth
in
outer
darkness
all
of
which
threw
alice
into
a
state
of
trepidation
suppose
we
do
suit
her
she
said
to
that
the
other
replied
that
their
way
had
been
made
smooth
by
reggie
mann
who
was
one
of
devon
favourites
a
century
and
more
ago
the
founder
of
the
devon
line
had
come
to
america
and
invested
his
savings
in
land
on
manhattan
island
other
people
had
toiled
and
built
a
city
there
and
generation
after
generation
of
the
devons
had
sat
by
and
collected
the
rents
until
now
their
fortune
amounted
to
four
or
five
hundred
millions
of
dollars
they
were
the
richest
old
family
in
america
and
the
most
famous
and
in
devon
the
oldest
member
of
the
line
was
centred
all
its
social
majesty
and
dominion
she
lived
a
stately
and
formal
life
precisely
like
a
queen
no
one
ever
saw
her
save
upon
her
raised
chair
of
state
and
she
wore
her
jewels
even
at
breakfast
she
was
the
arbiter
of
social
destinies
and
the
breakwater
against
which
the
floods
of
new
wealth
beat
in
vain
reggie
mann
told
wonderful
tales
about
the
contents
of
her
enormous
mail
about
wives
and
daughters
of
mighty
rich
men
who
flung
themselves
at
her
feet
and
pleaded
abjectly
for
her
favour
who
laid
siege
to
her
house
for
months
and
intrigued
and
pulled
wires
to
get
near
her
and
even
bought
the
favour
of
her
servants
if
reggie
might
be
believed
great
financial
wars
had
been
fought
and
the
of
the
world
convulsed
more
than
once
because
of
these
social
struggles
and
women
of
wealth
and
beauty
had
offered
to
sell
themselves
for
the
privilege
which
was
so
freely
granted
to
them
they
came
to
the
old
family
mansion
and
rang
the
bell
and
the
solemn
butler
ushered
them
past
the
grand
staircase
and
into
the
front
to
wait
perhaps
five
minutes
later
he
came
in
and
rolled
back
the
doors
and
they
stood
up
and
beheld
a
withered
old
lady
nearly
eighty
years
of
age
bedecked
with
diamonds
and
seated
upon
a
sort
of
throne
they
approached
and
oliver
introduced
them
and
the
old
lady
held
out
a
lifeless
hand
and
then
they
sat
down
devon
asked
them
a
few
questions
as
to
how
much
of
new
york
they
had
seen
and
how
they
liked
it
and
whom
they
had
met
but
most
of
the
time
she
simply
looked
them
over
and
left
the
making
of
conversation
to
oliver
as
for
montague
he
sat
feeling
perplexed
and
uncomfortable
and
wondering
deep
down
in
him
whether
it
could
really
be
america
in
which
this
was
happening
you
see
oliver
explained
to
them
when
they
were
seated
in
their
carriage
again
her
mind
is
failing
and
it
really
quite
difficult
for
her
to
receive
i
glad
i
do
have
to
call
on
her
more
than
once
was
comment
when
do
we
know
the
verdict
when
you
get
a
card
marked
devon
at
home
said
oliver
and
he
went
on
to
tell
them
about
the
war
which
had
shaken
society
long
ago
when
the
mighty
dame
had
asserted
her
right
to
be
devon
and
the
only
mrs
devon
he
told
them
also
about
her
wonderful
of
china
which
had
cost
thirty
thousand
dollars
and
was
as
fragile
as
a
wing
each
piece
bore
her
crest
and
she
had
a
china
expert
to
attend
to
washing
and
packing
it
no
common
hand
was
ever
allowed
to
touch
it
he
told
them
also
how
devon
housekeeper
had
wrestled
for
so
long
trying
to
teach
the
maids
to
arrange
the
furniture
in
the
great
precisely
as
the
mistress
ordered
until
finally
a
complete
set
of
photographs
had
been
taken
so
that
the
maids
might
do
their
work
by
chart
alice
went
back
to
the
hotel
for
robbie
walling
was
to
call
and
take
her
home
to
lunch
and
montague
and
his
brother
strolled
round
to
reggie
mann
apartments
to
report
upon
their
visit
reggie
received
them
in
a
pair
of
pink
silk
pyjamas
decorated
with
ribbons
and
bows
and
with
slippers
set
with
pearls
a
present
from
a
feminine
adorer
montague
noticed
to
his
dismay
that
the
little
man
wore
a
gold
bracelet
upon
one
arm
he
explained
that
he
had
led
a
cotillion
the
night
before
or
rather
this
morning
he
had
got
home
at
five
he
looked
quite
white
and
tired
and
there
were
the
remains
of
a
breakfast
of
on
the
table
did
you
see
the
old
girl
he
asked
and
how
does
she
hold
up
she
game
said
oliver
i
had
the
devil
own
time
getting
you
in
said
the
other
getting
harder
every
day
you
excuse
me
reggie
added
if
i
get
ready
i
have
an
engagement
and
he
turned
to
his
which
was
covered
with
an
array
of
cosmetics
and
perfumes
and
proceeded
in
a
way
to
paint
his
face
meanwhile
his
valet
was
flitting
silently
here
and
there
getting
ready
his
afternoon
costume
and
montague
in
spite
of
himself
followed
the
man
with
his
eyes
a
haberdasher
shop
might
have
been
kept
going
for
quite
a
while
upon
the
contents
of
reggie
dressers
his
clothing
was
kept
in
a
room
adjoining
the
montague
who
was
near
the
door
could
see
the
rosewood
wardrobes
each
devoted
to
a
separate
article
of
for
instance
laid
upon
sliding
racks
tier
upon
tier
of
them
of
every
material
and
colour
there
was
a
closet
fitted
with
shelves
and
equipped
like
a
little
shoe
store
high
shoes
and
low
shoes
black
ones
brown
ones
and
white
ones
and
each
fitted
over
a
last
to
keep
its
shape
perfect
these
shoes
were
all
made
to
order
according
to
reggie
designs
and
three
times
a
year
there
was
a
cleaning
out
and
those
which
had
gone
out
of
fashion
became
the
prey
of
his
man
there
was
a
safe
in
one
closet
in
which
jewellery
was
kept
the
was
furnished
like
a
lady
boudoir
the
furniture
upholstered
with
exquisite
embroidered
silk
and
the
bed
hung
with
curtains
of
the
same
material
there
was
a
huge
bunch
of
roses
on
the
and
the
odour
of
roses
hung
heavy
in
the
room
the
valet
stood
at
attention
with
a
rack
of
neckties
from
which
reggie
critically
selected
one
to
match
his
shirt
are
you
going
to
take
alice
with
you
down
to
the
havens
he
was
asking
and
he
added
you
meet
vivie
patton
down
there
she
had
another
row
at
home
you
do
say
so
exclaimed
oliver
yes
said
the
other
frank
waited
up
all
night
for
her
and
he
wept
and
tore
his
hair
and
vowed
he
would
kill
the
count
vivie
told
him
to
go
to
hell
good
god
said
oliver
who
told
you
that
the
faithful
alphonse
said
reggie
nodding
toward
his
valet
her
maid
told
him
and
frank
vows
he
sue
i
half
expected
to
see
it
in
the
papers
this
morning
i
met
vivie
on
the
street
yesterday
said
oliver
she
looked
as
chipper
as
ever
reggie
shrugged
his
shoulders
have
you
seen
this
week
paper
he
asked
they
got
another
of
ysabel
suppressed
poems
in
and
then
he
turned
toward
montague
to
explain
that
ysabel
was
the
pseudonym
of
a
young
débutante
who
had
fallen
under
the
spell
of
baudelaire
and
wilde
and
had
published
a
volume
of
poems
of
such
furious
eroticism
that
her
parents
were
buying
up
stray
copies
at
fabulous
prices
then
the
conversation
turned
to
the
horse
show
and
for
quite
a
while
they
talked
about
who
was
going
to
wear
what
finally
oliver
rose
saying
that
they
would
have
to
get
a
bite
to
eat
before
leaving
for
the
havens
you
have
a
good
time
said
reggie
i
have
gone
myself
only
i
promised
to
stay
and
help
de
graffenried
design
a
dinner
so
long
montague
had
heard
nothing
about
the
visit
to
the
havens
but
now
as
they
strolled
down
the
avenue
oliver
explained
that
they
were
to
spend
the
weekend
at
castle
havens
there
was
quite
a
party
going
up
this
friday
afternoon
and
they
would
find
one
of
the
havens
private
cars
waiting
they
had
nothing
to
do
meantime
for
their
valets
would
attend
to
their
packing
and
alice
and
her
maid
would
meet
them
at
the
depot
castle
havens
is
one
of
the
show
places
of
the
country
oliver
added
you
see
the
real
thing
this
time
and
while
they
lunched
he
went
on
to
entertain
his
brother
with
particulars
concerning
the
place
and
its
owners
john
had
inherited
the
bulk
of
the
enormous
havens
fortune
and
he
posed
as
his
father
successor
in
the
steel
trust
some
day
some
one
of
the
big
men
would
gobble
him
up
meantime
he
amused
himself
fussing
over
the
petty
details
of
administration
havens
had
taken
a
fancy
to
a
rural
life
and
they
had
built
this
huge
palace
in
the
hills
of
connecticut
and
she
wrote
verses
in
which
she
pictured
herself
as
a
simple
shepherdess
and
all
that
sort
of
stuff
but
no
one
minded
that
because
the
place
was
grand
and
there
was
always
so
much
to
do
they
had
forty
or
fifty
polo
ponies
for
instance
and
every
spring
the
place
was
filled
with
polo
men
at
the
depot
they
caught
sight
of
charlie
carter
in
his
big
red
are
you
going
to
the
havens
he
said
tell
them
going
to
pick
up
chauncey
on
the
way
that
chauncey
venable
the
major
nephew
said
oliver
as
they
strolled
to
the
train
poor
chauncey
he
in
exile
how
do
you
mean
asked
montague
why
he
dare
come
into
new
york
said
the
other
have
you
read
about
it
in
the
papers
he
lost
one
or
two
hundred
thousand
the
other
night
in
a
gambling
place
and
the
district
attorney
trying
to
catch
him
does
he
want
to
put
him
in
jail
asked
montague
heavens
no
said
oliver
put
a
venable
in
jail
he
wants
him
for
a
witness
against
the
gambler
and
poor
chauncey
is
flitting
about
the
country
hiding
with
his
friends
and
wailing
because
he
miss
the
horse
show
they
boarded
the
palatial
private
car
and
were
introduced
to
a
number
of
other
guests
among
them
was
major
venable
and
while
oliver
buried
himself
in
the
new
issue
of
the
society
journal
which
contained
the
poem
of
the
erotic
ysabel
his
brother
chatted
with
the
major
the
latter
had
taken
quite
a
fancy
to
the
big
handsome
stranger
to
whom
everything
in
the
city
was
so
new
and
interesting
tell
me
what
you
thought
of
the
snow
palace
said
he
i
an
idea
that
winnie
got
quite
a
crush
on
you
you
find
her
dangerous
my
boy
she
make
you
pay
for
your
dinners
before
you
get
through
after
the
train
was
under
way
the
major
got
himself
surrounded
with
some
apollinaris
and
scotch
and
then
settled
back
to
enjoy
himself
did
you
see
the
kid
at
the
ferry
he
asked
that
what
our
abstemious
district
attorney
terms
my
precious
young
you
meet
him
at
the
castle
the
havens
are
good
to
him
they
know
how
it
feels
i
guess
when
john
was
a
youngster
his
piratical
uncle
had
to
camp
in
jersey
for
six
months
or
so
to
escape
the
strong
arm
of
the
law
do
you
know
about
it
continued
the
major
sipping
at
his
beverage
sic
transit
gloria
mundi
that
was
when
the
great
captain
kidd
havens
was
piling
up
the
millions
which
his
survivors
are
spending
with
such
charming
insouciance
he
was
plundering
a
railroad
and
the
original
progenitor
of
the
wallings
tried
to
buy
the
control
away
from
him
and
havens
issued
ten
or
twenty
millions
of
new
stock
overnight
in
the
face
of
a
court
injunction
and
got
away
with
most
of
his
money
it
reads
like
opera
bouffe
you
know
they
had
a
regular
armed
camp
across
the
river
for
about
six
months
until
captain
kidd
went
up
to
albany
with
half
a
million
dollars
worth
of
greenbacks
in
a
satchel
and
induced
the
legislature
to
legalize
the
proceedings
that
was
just
after
the
war
you
know
but
i
remember
it
as
if
it
were
yesterday
it
seems
strange
to
think
that
anyone
should
know
about
it
i
know
about
havens
in
a
general
way
said
montague
yes
said
the
major
but
i
know
in
a
particular
way
because
carried
some
of
that
railroad
paper
all
these
years
and
it
never
paid
any
dividends
since
it
has
a
tendency
to
interfere
with
my
appreciation
of
john
lavish
hospitality
montague
was
reminded
of
the
story
of
the
roman
emperor
who
pointed
out
that
money
had
no
smell
maybe
not
said
the
major
but
all
the
same
if
you
were
superstitious
you
might
make
out
an
argument
from
the
havens
fortune
take
that
poor
girl
who
married
the
count
and
the
major
went
on
to
picture
the
denouement
of
that
famous
international
alliance
which
many
years
ago
had
been
the
sensation
of
two
continents
all
society
had
attended
the
gorgeous
wedding
an
archbishop
had
performed
the
ceremony
and
the
newspapers
had
devoted
pages
to
describing
the
gowns
and
the
jewels
and
the
presents
and
all
the
rest
of
the
magnificence
and
the
count
was
a
wretched
little
degenerate
who
beat
and
kicked
his
wife
and
flaunted
his
mistresses
in
her
face
and
wasted
fourteen
million
dollars
of
her
money
in
a
couple
of
years
the
mind
could
scarcely
follow
the
orgies
of
this
creature
he
had
spent
two
hundred
thousand
dollars
on
a
banquet
and
half
as
much
again
for
a
wardrobe
in
which
louis
the
sixteenth
had
kept
his
clothes
he
had
charged
a
diamond
necklace
to
his
wife
and
taken
two
of
the
four
rows
of
diamonds
out
of
it
before
he
presented
it
to
her
he
had
paid
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
a
year
to
a
jockey
whom
the
parisian
populace
admired
and
a
fortune
for
a
palace
in
verona
which
he
had
promptly
torn
down
for
the
sake
of
a
few
painted
ceilings
the
major
told
about
one
outdoor
fete
which
he
had
given
upon
a
sudden
whim
ten
thousand
venetian
lanterns
ten
thousand
metres
of
carpet
three
thousand
gilded
chairs
and
two
or
three
hundred
waiters
in
fancy
costumes
two
palaces
built
in
a
lake
with
and
dolphins
and
half
a
dozen
orchestras
and
several
hundred
chorus
girls
from
the
grand
opera
and
in
between
adventures
such
as
these
he
bought
a
seat
in
the
chamber
of
deputies
and
made
speeches
and
fought
duels
in
defence
of
the
holy
catholic
church
and
wrote
articles
for
the
yellow
journals
of
america
and
that
the
fate
of
my
lost
dividends
growled
the
major
there
were
several
automobiles
to
meet
the
party
at
the
depot
and
they
were
whirled
through
a
broad
avenue
up
a
valley
and
past
a
little
lake
and
so
to
the
gates
of
castle
havens
it
was
a
tremendous
building
a
couple
of
hundred
feet
long
one
entered
into
a
main
hall
perhaps
fifty
feet
wide
with
a
great
fireplace
arid
staircase
of
marble
and
bronze
and
furniture
of
gilded
wood
and
crimson
velvet
and
a
huge
painting
covering
three
of
the
walls
representing
the
conquest
of
peru
each
of
the
rooms
was
furnished
in
the
style
of
a
different
period
one
louis
quatorze
one
louis
quinze
one
marie
antoinette
and
so
on
there
was
a
and
a
regal
a
in
the
georgian
style
and
a
also
in
the
english
fashion
with
high
wainscoting
and
open
beams
in
the
ceiling
and
a
library
and
a
and
conservatory
upstairs
in
the
main
suite
of
rooms
was
a
royal
bedstead
which
alone
was
rumoured
to
have
cost
thousand
dollars
and
you
might
have
some
idea
of
the
magnificence
of
things
when
you
learned
that
underneath
the
gilding
of
the
furniture
was
the
rare
and
precious
circassian
walnut
all
this
was
beautiful
but
what
brought
the
guests
to
castle
havens
was
the
casino
so
the
major
had
remarked
it
was
really
a
private
athletic
club
with
hippodrome
having
a
ring
the
size
of
that
in
madison
square
garden
and
a
skylight
roof
and
thirty
or
forty
for
night
events
there
were
billiard
and
tennis
and
a
completely
equipped
gymnasium
a
and
a
with
turkish
and
russian
baths
in
this
casino
alone
there
were
rooms
for
forty
guests
such
was
castle
havens
it
had
cost
three
or
four
millions
of
dollars
and
within
the
wall
which
surrounded
its
grounds
lived
two
people
who
dreaded
nothing
so
much
as
to
be
alone
there
were
always
guests
and
on
special
occasions
there
might
be
three
or
four
score
they
went
whirling
about
the
country
in
their
autos
they
rode
and
drove
they
played
games
outdoor
and
indoor
or
gambled
or
lounged
and
chatted
or
wandered
about
at
their
own
sweet
will
coming
to
one
of
these
places
was
not
different
from
staying
at
a
great
hotel
save
that
the
company
was
selected
and
instead
of
paying
a
bill
you
gave
twenty
or
thirty
dollars
to
the
servants
when
you
left
it
was
a
great
palace
of
pleasure
in
which
beautiful
and
graceful
men
and
women
played
together
in
all
sorts
of
beautiful
and
graceful
ways
in
the
evenings
great
logs
blazed
in
the
fireplace
in
the
hall
and
there
might
be
an
informal
dance
there
was
always
music
at
hand
now
and
then
there
would
be
a
stately
ball
with
rich
gowns
and
flashing
jewels
and
the
grounds
ablaze
with
lights
and
a
full
orchestra
and
special
trains
from
the
city
or
a
whole
theatrical
company
would
be
brought
down
to
give
an
entertainment
in
the
theatre
or
a
minstrel
show
or
a
troupe
of
acrobats
or
a
menagerie
of
trained
animals
or
perhaps
there
would
be
a
great
pianist
or
a
palmist
or
a
trance
medium
anyone
at
all
would
be
welcome
who
could
bring
a
new
thrill
it
mattered
nothing
at
all
though
the
price
might
be
several
hundred
dollars
a
minute
montague
shook
hands
with
his
host
and
hostess
and
with
a
number
of
others
among
them
billy
price
who
forthwith
challenged
him
and
carried
him
off
to
the
here
he
took
a
rifle
and
proceeded
to
satisfy
her
as
to
his
skill
this
brought
him
to
the
notice
of
siegfried
harvey
who
was
a
famous
rider
and
harvey
father
owned
a
score
of
and
had
named
him
after
a
he
was
a
big
fellow
a
favourite
of
every
one
and
next
morning
when
he
found
that
montague
sat
a
horse
like
one
who
was
born
to
it
he
invited
him
to
come
out
to
his
place
on
long
island
and
see
some
of
the
then
after
he
had
dressed
for
dinner
montague
came
downstairs
and
found
betty
wyman
shining
like
aurora
in
an
cloud
she
introduced
him
to
vivie
patton
who
was
tall
and
slender
and
fascinating
and
had
told
her
husband
to
go
to
hell
vivie
had
black
eyes
that
snapped
and
sparkled
and
she
was
a
geyser
of
animation
in
a
perpetual
condition
of
eruption
montague
wondered
if
she
would
have
talked
with
him
so
gaily
had
she
known
what
he
knew
about
her
domestic
entanglements
the
company
moved
into
the
where
there
was
served
another
of
those
elaborate
and
enormously
expensive
meals
which
he
concluded
he
was
fated
to
eat
for
the
rest
of
his
life
only
instead
of
billy
alden
with
her
scotch
there
was
vivie
who
drank
champagne
in
terrifying
quantities
and
afterward
there
was
the
inevitable
grouping
of
the
bridge
fiends
among
the
guests
there
was
a
and
foreign
personage
who
was
the
lion
of
the
evening
and
sat
with
half
a
dozen
admiring
women
about
him
now
he
was
escorted
to
the
and
revealed
the
fact
that
he
was
a
violin
virtuoso
he
played
what
was
called
salon
music
music
written
especially
for
ladies
and
gentlemen
to
listen
to
after
dinner
and
also
a
strange
contrivance
called
a
concerto
put
together
to
enable
the
player
to
exhibit
within
a
brief
space
the
utmost
possible
variety
of
finger
gymnastics
to
learn
to
perform
these
feats
one
had
to
devote
his
whole
lifetime
to
practising
them
just
like
any
circus
acrobat
and
so
his
mind
became
atrophied
and
a
naive
and
elemental
vanity
was
all
that
was
left
to
him
montague
stood
for
a
while
staring
and
then
took
to
watching
the
company
who
chattered
and
laughed
all
through
the
performance
afterward
he
strolled
into
the
where
billy
price
and
chauncey
venable
were
having
an
exciting
bout
and
from
there
to
the
where
the
stout
little
major
had
gotten
a
group
of
young
bloods
about
him
to
play
klondike
this
was
a
game
of
deadly
hazards
which
they
played
without
limit
the
players
themselves
were
silent
and
impassive
but
the
spectators
who
gathered
about
were
tense
with
excitement
in
the
morning
charlie
carter
carried
off
alice
and
oliver
and
betty
in
his
auto
and
montague
spent
his
time
in
trying
some
of
jumping
horses
the
horse
show
was
to
open
in
new
york
on
monday
and
there
was
an
atmosphere
of
suppressed
excitement
because
of
this
prospect
caroline
smythe
a
charming
young
widow
strolled
about
with
him
and
told
him
all
about
this
show
and
the
people
who
would
take
part
in
it
and
in
the
afternoon
major
venable
took
him
for
a
stroll
and
showed
him
the
grounds
he
had
been
told
what
huge
sums
had
been
expended
in
laying
them
out
but
after
all
the
figures
were
nothing
compared
with
an
actual
view
there
were
hills
and
slopes
and
endless
vistas
of
green
lawns
and
gardens
dotted
with
the
gleaming
white
of
marble
staircases
and
fountains
and
statuary
there
was
a
great
italian
walk
leading
by
successive
esplanades
to
an
electric
fountain
with
a
basin
sixty
feet
across
and
a
bronze
chariot
and
marble
horses
there
were
sunken
gardens
with
a
fountain
brought
from
the
south
of
france
and
greek
peristyles
and
seats
of
marble
and
vases
and
other
treasures
of
art
and
then
there
were
the
stables
a
huge
renaissance
building
with
a
perfectly
equipped
theatre
above
there
was
a
model
farm
and
dairy
a
and
an
enclosed
for
the
children
and
and
greenhouses
and
one
was
prepared
for
and
a
menagerie
finally
on
their
way
back
they
passed
the
casino
where
musical
chimes
pealed
out
the
montague
stopped
and
gazed
up
at
the
tower
from
which
the
sounds
had
come
the
more
he
gazed
the
more
he
found
to
gaze
at
the
roof
of
this
building
had
many
gables
in
the
queen
anne
style
and
from
the
midst
of
them
shot
up
the
tower
which
was
octagonal
and
solid
suggestive
of
the
normans
it
was
decorated
with
in
white
stucco
and
a
few
miscellaneous
ornaments
like
the
gilded
tassels
one
sees
upon
plush
curtains
overtopping
all
of
this
was
the
dome
of
a
turkish
mosque
rising
out
of
the
dome
was
something
that
looked
like
a
and
out
of
this
rose
the
slender
white
steeple
of
a
methodist
country
church
on
top
of
that
was
a
statue
of
diana
what
are
you
looking
at
asked
the
major
nothing
said
montague
as
he
moved
on
has
there
ever
been
any
insanity
in
the
havens
family
i
do
know
replied
the
other
puzzled
they
say
the
old
man
never
could
sleep
at
night
and
used
to
wander
about
alone
in
the
park
i
suppose
he
had
things
on
his
conscience
they
strolled
away
and
the
major
of
gossip
were
opened
there
was
an
old
merchant
in
new
york
who
had
been
havens
private
secretary
and
havens
was
always
in
terror
of
assassination
and
so
whenever
they
travelled
abroad
he
and
the
secretary
exchanged
places
the
old
man
is
big
and
imposing
said
the
major
and
it
funny
to
hear
him
tell
how
he
used
to
receive
the
visitors
and
be
stared
at
by
the
crowds
while
havens
who
was
little
and
insignificant
would
pretend
to
make
himself
useful
and
then
one
day
a
creature
came
into
the
havens
office
and
began
tearing
the
wrappings
off
some
package
that
shone
like
metal
and
quick
as
a
flash
he
and
havens
flung
themselves
down
on
the
floor
upon
their
faces
then
as
nothing
happened
they
looked
up
and
saw
the
puzzled
stranger
gazing
over
the
railing
at
them
he
had
a
patent
churn
made
of
copper
which
he
wanted
havens
to
market
for
him
montague
could
have
wished
that
this
party
might
last
for
a
week
or
two
instead
of
only
two
days
he
was
interested
in
the
life
and
in
those
who
lived
it
all
whom
he
met
were
people
prominent
in
the
social
world
and
some
in
the
business
world
as
well
and
one
could
not
have
asked
a
better
chance
to
study
them
montague
was
taking
his
time
and
feeling
his
way
slowly
but
all
the
time
that
he
was
playing
and
gossiping
he
never
lost
from
mind
his
real
purpose
which
was
to
find
a
place
for
himself
in
the
world
of
affairs
and
he
watched
for
people
from
whose
conversation
he
could
get
a
view
of
this
aspect
of
things
so
he
was
interested
when
smythe
remarked
that
among
his
was
vandam
an
official
of
one
of
the
great
companies
freddie
vandam
as
the
lady
called
him
was
a
man
of
might
in
the
financial
world
and
montague
said
to
himself
that
in
meeting
him
he
would
really
be
accomplishing
something
crack
shots
and
and
experts
were
all
very
well
but
he
had
his
living
to
earn
and
he
feared
that
the
problem
was
going
to
prove
complicated
so
he
was
glad
when
chance
brought
him
and
young
vandam
together
and
siegfried
harvey
introduced
them
and
then
montague
got
the
biggest
shock
which
new
york
had
given
him
yet
it
was
not
what
freddie
vandam
said
doubtless
he
had
a
right
to
be
interested
in
the
horse
show
since
he
was
to
exhibit
many
fine
horses
and
he
had
no
reason
to
feel
called
upon
to
talk
about
anything
more
serious
to
a
stranger
at
a
house
party
but
it
was
the
manner
of
the
man
his
whole
personality
for
freddie
was
a
man
of
fashion
with
all
the
exaggerated
and
farcical
mannerisms
of
the
dandy
of
the
comic
papers
he
wore
a
conspicuous
and
foppish
costume
and
posed
with
a
little
cane
he
cultivated
a
waving
pompadour
and
his
silky
moustache
and
beard
were
carefully
trimmed
to
points
and
kept
sharp
by
his
active
fingers
his
conversation
was
full
of
french
phrases
and
french
opinions
he
had
been
reared
abroad
and
had
a
contempt
for
all
things
dictating
his
business
letters
in
french
and
leaving
it
for
his
stenographer
to
translate
them
his
shirts
were
embroidered
with
violets
and
perfumed
with
violets
and
there
were
bunches
of
violets
at
his
horses
heads
so
that
he
might
get
the
odour
as
he
drove
there
was
a
cruel
saying
about
freddie
vandam
that
if
only
he
had
had
a
little
more
brains
he
would
have
been
and
montague
sat
and
watched
his
mannerisms
and
listened
to
his
inanities
with
his
mind
in
a
state
of
bewilderment
and
dismay
when
at
last
he
got
up
and
walked
away
it
was
with
a
new
sense
of
the
complicated
nature
of
the
problem
that
confronted
him
who
was
there
that
could
give
him
the
key
to
this
mystery
who
could
interpret
to
him
a
world
in
which
a
man
such
as
this
was
in
control
of
four
or
five
hundred
millions
of
trust
funds
chapter
vii
it
was
quite
futile
to
attempt
to
induce
anyone
to
talk
about
serious
matters
just
now
for
the
coming
week
all
society
belonged
to
the
horse
the
parties
which
went
to
church
on
sunday
morning
talked
about
horses
on
the
way
and
the
crowds
that
gathered
in
front
of
the
church
door
to
watch
them
descend
from
their
automobiles
and
to
get
points
on
their
conspicuous
costumes
these
would
read
about
horses
all
afternoon
in
the
sunday
papers
and
about
the
gowns
which
the
women
would
wear
at
the
show
some
of
the
party
went
up
on
sunday
evening
montague
went
with
the
rest
on
monday
morning
and
had
lunch
with
robbie
walling
and
oliver
and
alice
they
had
arrayed
him
in
a
frock
coat
and
silk
hat
and
fancy
spats
and
they
took
him
and
sat
him
in
the
front
row
of
robbie
box
there
was
a
great
arena
in
which
the
horses
performed
and
then
a
railing
and
a
broad
promenade
for
the
spectators
and
then
raised
a
few
feet
above
the
boxes
in
which
sat
all
society
for
the
horse
show
had
now
become
a
great
social
function
last
year
a
visiting
foreign
prince
had
seen
fit
to
attend
it
and
this
year
everybody
would
come
montague
was
rapidly
getting
used
to
things
he
observed
with
a
smile
how
easy
it
was
to
take
for
granted
embroidered
bed
and
table
linen
and
mural
paintings
and
private
cars
and
gold
plate
at
first
it
had
seemed
to
him
strange
to
be
waited
upon
by
a
white
woman
and
by
a
white
man
quite
unthinkable
but
he
was
becoming
accustomed
to
having
silent
and
expressionless
lackeys
everywhere
about
him
attending
to
his
slightest
want
so
he
presumed
that
if
he
waited
long
enough
he
might
even
get
used
to
horses
which
had
their
tails
cut
off
to
stumps
and
their
manes
to
rows
of
bristles
and
which
had
been
taught
to
lift
their
feet
in
strange
and
eccentric
ways
and
were
driven
with
burred
bits
in
their
mouths
to
torture
them
and
make
them
step
lively
there
were
and
hunters
every
kind
of
horse
that
is
used
for
pleasure
over
a
hundred
different
classes
of
them
they
were
put
through
their
paces
about
the
ring
and
there
was
a
committee
which
judged
them
and
awarded
blue
and
red
ribbons
apparently
their
highly
artificial
kind
of
excellence
was
a
real
thing
to
the
people
who
took
part
in
the
show
for
the
spectators
thrilled
with
excitement
and
applauded
the
popular
victors
there
was
a
whole
set
of
conventions
which
were
generally
understood
there
was
even
a
new
language
you
were
told
that
these
turnouts
were
nobby
and
natty
they
were
swagger
and
smart
and
swell
however
the
horse
was
really
a
small
part
of
this
show
before
one
had
sat
out
an
afternoon
he
realized
that
the
function
was
in
reality
a
show
of
society
for
six
or
seven
hours
during
the
day
the
broad
promenade
would
be
so
packed
with
human
beings
that
one
moved
about
with
difficulty
and
this
throng
gazed
towards
the
ring
almost
never
it
stared
up
into
the
boxes
all
the
year
round
the
discontented
millions
of
the
middle
classes
read
of
the
doings
of
the
smart
set
and
here
they
had
a
chance
to
come
and
see
and
real
and
dressed
in
their
showiest
costumes
here
was
all
the
grand
monde
in
numbered
boxes
and
with
their
names
upon
the
programmes
so
that
one
could
get
them
straight
ten
thousand
people
from
other
cities
had
come
to
new
york
on
purpose
to
get
a
look
women
who
lived
in
and
made
their
own
clothes
had
come
to
get
hints
all
the
dressmakers
in
town
were
present
for
the
same
society
reporters
had
come
with
notebooks
in
hand
and
next
morning
the
imitators
of
society
all
over
the
united
states
would
read
about
it
in
such
fashion
as
this
chauncey
venable
was
becomingly
gowned
in
mauve
cloth
made
with
an
eton
jacket
trimmed
with
silk
braid
and
opening
over
a
chemisette
of
lace
her
hat
was
of
the
same
colour
draped
with
a
great
quantity
of
mauve
and
orange
tulle
and
surmounted
with
birds
of
paradise
to
match
her
furs
were
silver
fox
the
most
intelligent
of
the
great
metropolitan
dailies
would
print
columns
of
this
sort
of
material
and
as
for
the
yellow
journals
they
would
have
discussions
of
the
costumes
by
experts
and
half
a
page
of
pictures
of
the
most
conspicuous
of
the
while
montague
sat
talking
with
walling
half
a
dozen
cameras
were
snapped
at
them
and
once
a
young
man
with
a
placed
himself
in
front
of
them
and
went
placidly
to
concerning
such
things
the
society
dame
had
three
different
sets
of
emotions
first
the
one
which
she
showed
in
public
that
of
bored
and
contemptuous
indifference
second
the
one
which
she
expressed
to
her
friends
that
of
outraged
but
helpless
indignation
and
third
the
one
which
she
really
felt
that
of
triumphant
exultation
over
her
rivals
whose
pictures
were
not
published
and
whose
costumes
were
not
described
it
was
a
great
dress
parade
of
society
women
one
who
wished
to
play
a
proper
part
in
it
would
spend
at
least
ten
thousand
dollars
upon
her
costumes
for
the
week
it
was
necessary
to
have
a
different
gown
for
the
afternoon
and
evening
of
each
day
and
some
who
were
adepts
at
quick
changes
and
were
proud
of
it
would
wear
three
or
four
a
day
and
so
need
a
couple
of
dozen
gowns
for
the
show
and
of
course
there
had
to
be
hats
and
shoes
and
gloves
to
match
there
would
be
robes
of
priceless
fur
hung
carelessly
over
the
balcony
to
make
a
setting
and
in
the
evening
there
would
be
pyrotechnical
displays
of
jewels
virginia
landis
wore
a
pair
of
simple
pearl
earrings
which
she
told
the
reporters
had
cost
twenty
thousand
dollars
and
there
were
two
women
who
displayed
four
hundred
thousand
dollars
worth
of
diamonds
and
each
of
them
had
hired
a
detective
to
hover
about
in
the
crowd
and
keep
watch
over
her
nor
must
one
suppose
because
the
horse
was
an
inconspicuous
part
of
the
show
that
he
was
therefore
an
inexpensive
part
one
man
was
to
be
seen
here
driving
a
of
black
stallions
which
had
cost
forty
thousand
there
were
other
men
who
drove
only
one
horse
and
had
paid
forty
thousand
for
that
half
a
million
was
a
moderate
estimate
of
the
cost
of
the
string
which
some
would
exhibit
and
of
course
these
horses
were
useless
save
for
show
purposes
and
to
breed
other
horses
like
them
many
of
them
never
went
out
of
their
stables
except
for
exercise
upon
a
track
and
the
cumbrous
and
enormous
expensive
coaches
were
never
by
any
possibility
used
elsewhere
when
they
were
taken
from
place
to
place
they
seldom
went
upon
their
own
wheels
and
there
were
people
here
who
made
their
chief
occupation
in
life
the
winning
of
blue
ribbons
at
these
shows
they
kept
great
country
estates
especially
for
the
horses
and
had
private
indoor
exhibition
rings
robbie
walling
and
chauncey
venable
were
both
such
people
in
the
summer
of
next
year
another
of
the
wallings
took
a
string
across
the
water
to
teach
the
game
to
society
in
london
he
took
twenty
or
thirty
horses
under
the
charge
of
an
expert
manager
and
a
dozen
assistants
he
sent
sixteen
different
kinds
of
carriages
and
two
great
coaches
and
a
ton
of
harness
and
other
stuff
it
required
one
whole
deck
of
a
steamer
and
the
expedition
enabled
him
to
get
rid
of
six
hundred
thousand
dollars
all
through
the
day
of
course
robbie
was
down
in
the
ring
with
his
trainers
and
his
competitors
and
montague
sat
and
kept
his
wife
company
there
was
a
steady
stream
of
visitors
who
came
to
congratulate
her
upon
their
successes
and
to
commiserate
with
chauncey
venable
over
the
sufferings
of
the
victim
of
a
district
attorney
there
was
just
one
drawback
to
the
horse
show
as
montague
gathered
from
the
conversation
that
went
on
among
the
callers
it
was
public
and
there
was
no
way
to
prevent
undesirable
people
from
taking
part
there
were
it
appeared
hordes
of
rich
people
in
new
york
who
were
not
in
society
and
of
whose
existence
society
was
haughtily
unaware
but
these
people
might
enter
horses
and
win
prizes
and
even
rent
a
box
and
exhibit
their
clothes
and
they
might
induce
the
reporters
to
mention
them
and
of
course
the
ignorant
populace
did
not
know
the
difference
and
stared
at
them
just
as
hard
as
at
robbie
or
winnie
and
so
for
a
whole
blissful
week
these
people
had
all
the
sensations
of
being
in
society
it
wo
be
very
long
before
that
will
kill
the
horse
show
said
vivie
patton
with
a
snap
of
her
black
eyes
there
was
miss
yvette
simpkins
for
instance
society
frothed
at
the
mouth
when
her
name
was
mentioned
miss
yvette
was
the
niece
of
a
who
was
wealthy
and
she
thought
that
she
was
in
society
and
the
foolish
public
thought
so
too
miss
yvette
made
a
speciality
of
newspaper
publicity
you
were
always
seeing
her
picture
with
some
new
worth
creation
and
the
picture
would
be
labelled
miss
yvette
simpkins
the
woman
in
new
york
or
miss
yvette
simpkins
who
is
known
as
the
best
woman
whip
in
society
it
was
said
that
miss
yvette
who
was
short
and
stout
and
had
a
rosy
german
face
had
paid
five
thousand
dollars
at
one
clip
for
photographs
of
herself
in
a
new
wardrobe
and
her
pictures
were
sent
to
the
newspapers
in
bundles
of
a
dozen
at
a
time
miss
yvette
possessed
over
a
million
dollars
worth
of
diamonds
the
finest
in
the
country
according
to
the
newspapers
she
had
spent
a
hundred
and
thousand
dollars
this
year
upon
her
clothes
and
she
gave
long
interviews
in
which
she
set
forth
the
fact
that
a
woman
nowadays
could
not
really
be
well
dressed
upon
less
than
a
hundred
thousand
a
year
it
was
miss
boast
that
she
had
never
ridden
in
a
in
her
life
montague
always
had
a
soft
spot
in
his
heart
for
the
unfortunate
miss
yvette
who
laboured
so
hard
to
be
a
guiding
light
for
it
chanced
to
be
while
she
was
in
the
ring
exhibiting
her
skill
in
driving
tandem
that
he
met
with
a
fateful
encounter
afterward
when
he
came
to
look
back
upon
these
early
days
it
seemed
strange
to
him
that
he
should
have
gone
about
this
place
so
careless
and
unsuspecting
while
the
fates
were
weaving
strange
destinies
about
him
it
was
on
tuesday
afternoon
and
he
sat
in
the
box
of
venable
a
of
the
major
the
major
who
was
a
bachelor
was
there
himself
and
also
betty
wyman
who
was
making
sprightly
comments
on
the
and
there
strolled
into
the
box
chappie
de
peyster
accompanied
by
a
young
lady
so
many
people
had
stopped
and
been
introduced
and
then
passed
on
that
montague
merely
glanced
at
her
once
he
noticed
that
she
was
tall
and
graceful
and
caught
her
name
miss
hegan
the
turnouts
in
the
ring
consisted
of
one
horse
harnessed
in
front
of
another
and
montague
was
wondering
what
conceivable
motive
could
induce
a
human
being
to
hitch
and
drive
horses
in
that
fashion
the
conversation
turned
upon
miss
yvette
who
was
in
the
ring
and
betty
remarked
upon
the
airy
grace
with
which
she
wielded
the
long
whip
she
carried
did
you
see
what
the
paper
said
about
her
this
morning
she
miss
simpkins
was
exquisitely
clad
in
purple
velvet
and
so
on
she
looked
for
all
the
world
like
the
venus
at
the
hippodrome
why
is
she
in
society
asked
montague
curiously
she
exclaimed
betty
why
she
a
travesty
there
was
a
moment
pause
preceding
a
remark
by
their
young
lady
visitor
i
an
idea
said
she
that
the
real
reason
she
never
got
into
society
was
that
she
was
fond
of
her
old
father
and
montague
gave
a
short
glance
at
the
speaker
who
was
gazing
fixedly
into
the
ring
he
heard
the
major
chuckle
and
he
thought
that
he
heard
betty
wyman
give
a
little
sniff
a
few
moments
later
the
young
lady
arose
and
with
some
remark
to
venable
about
how
well
her
costume
became
her
she
passed
on
out
of
the
box
who
is
that
asked
montague
that
the
major
answered
that
laura
hegan
jim
hegan
daughter
oh
said
montague
and
caught
his
breath
jim
hegan
napoleon
of
finance
czar
of
a
gigantic
system
of
railroads
and
the
power
behind
the
political
thrones
of
many
states
his
only
daughter
too
the
major
added
gad
what
a
juicy
morsel
for
somebody
well
she
make
him
pay
for
all
he
gets
whoever
he
is
retorted
betty
vindictively
you
do
like
her
inquired
montague
and
betty
replied
promptly
i
do
not
her
daddy
and
betty
granddaddy
are
always
at
swords
points
put
in
major
venable
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
my
granddaddy
quarrels
said
the
young
lady
i
have
troubles
enough
of
my
own
what
is
the
matter
with
miss
hegan
asked
montague
laughing
she
an
idea
she
too
good
for
the
world
she
lives
in
said
betty
when
you
with
her
you
feel
as
you
will
before
the
judgment
throne
undoubtedly
a
disturbing
feeling
put
in
the
major
she
never
hands
you
anything
but
you
find
a
pin
hidden
in
it
went
on
the
girl
all
her
remarks
are
meant
to
be
read
backward
and
my
life
is
too
short
to
straighten
out
their
kinks
i
like
a
person
to
say
what
they
mean
in
plain
english
and
then
i
can
either
like
them
or
not
mostly
not
said
the
major
grimly
and
added
anyway
beautiful
perhaps
said
the
other
so
is
the
jungfrau
but
i
prefer
something
more
comfortable
what
chappie
de
peyster
beauing
her
around
for
asked
venable
is
he
a
candidate
maybe
his
debts
are
troubling
him
again
said
mistress
betty
he
must
be
in
a
desperate
did
you
hear
how
jack
audubon
proposed
to
her
did
jack
propose
exclaimed
the
major
of
course
he
did
said
the
girl
his
brother
told
me
then
for
montague
benefit
she
explained
jack
audubon
is
the
major
nephew
and
he
a
bookworm
and
spends
all
his
time
collecting
scarabs
what
did
he
say
to
her
asked
the
major
highly
amused
why
said
betty
he
told
her
he
knew
she
did
love
him
but
also
she
knew
that
he
did
care
anything
about
her
money
and
she
might
like
to
marry
him
so
that
other
men
would
let
her
alone
gad
cried
the
old
gentleman
slapping
his
knee
a
masterpiece
does
she
have
so
many
suitors
asked
montague
and
the
major
replied
my
dear
boy
she
have
a
hundred
million
dollars
some
day
at
this
point
oliver
put
in
appearance
and
betty
got
up
and
went
for
a
stroll
with
him
then
montague
asked
for
light
upon
miss
hegan
remark
what
she
said
is
perfectly
true
replied
the
major
only
it
riled
betty
there
many
a
gallant
dame
cruising
the
social
seas
who
has
stowed
her
old
relatives
out
of
sight
in
the
hold
what
the
matter
with
old
simpkins
asked
the
other
just
a
queer
boy
was
the
reply
he
has
a
big
pile
and
his
one
joy
in
life
is
the
divine
yvette
it
is
really
he
who
makes
her
ridiculous
he
has
a
regular
press
agent
for
her
a
chap
he
loads
up
with
jewellery
and
cheques
whenever
he
gets
her
picture
into
the
papers
the
major
paused
a
moment
to
greet
some
acquaintance
and
then
resumed
the
conversation
apparently
he
could
gossip
in
this
intimate
fashion
about
any
person
whom
you
named
old
simpkins
had
been
very
poor
as
a
boy
it
appeared
and
he
had
never
got
over
the
memory
of
it
miss
yvette
spent
fifty
thousand
at
a
clip
for
paris
gowns
but
every
day
her
old
uncle
would
save
up
the
lumps
of
sugar
which
came
with
the
expensive
lunch
he
had
brought
to
his
office
and
when
he
had
several
pounds
he
would
send
them
home
by
messenger
this
conversation
gave
montague
a
new
sense
of
the
complicatedness
of
the
world
into
which
he
had
come
miss
simpkins
was
impossible
and
yet
there
was
for
instance
that
landis
whom
he
had
met
at
winnie
duval
he
had
met
her
several
times
at
the
show
and
he
heard
the
major
and
his
chuckling
over
a
paragraph
in
the
society
journal
to
the
effect
that
virginia
van
rensselaer
landis
had
just
returned
from
a
successful
in
the
far
west
he
did
not
see
the
humour
of
this
at
least
not
until
they
had
told
him
of
another
paragraph
which
had
appeared
some
time
before
stating
that
landis
had
gone
to
acquire
residence
in
south
dakota
taking
with
her
trunks
and
a
poodle
and
that
leanie
hopkins
the
handsome
young
had
taken
a
six
months
vow
of
poverty
chastity
and
obedience
and
yet
landis
was
in
society
and
moreover
she
spent
nearly
as
much
upon
her
clothes
as
miss
yvette
and
the
clothes
were
quite
as
conspicuous
and
if
the
papers
did
not
print
pages
about
them
it
was
not
because
landis
was
not
perfectly
willing
she
was
painted
and
made
up
quite
as
frankly
as
any
on
the
stage
she
laughed
a
great
deal
and
in
a
high
key
and
she
and
her
friends
told
stories
which
made
montague
wish
to
move
out
of
the
way
landis
had
for
some
reason
taken
a
fancy
to
alice
and
invited
her
home
to
lunch
with
her
twice
during
the
show
and
after
they
had
got
home
in
the
evening
the
girl
sat
upon
the
bed
in
her
wrapper
and
told
montague
and
his
mother
and
mammy
lucy
all
about
her
visit
i
do
believe
that
woman
has
a
thing
to
do
or
to
think
about
in
the
world
except
to
wear
clothes
she
said
why
she
has
adjustable
mirrors
on
so
that
she
can
see
every
part
of
her
skirts
and
she
gets
all
her
gowns
from
paris
four
times
a
year
she
says
there
are
four
seasons
now
instead
of
two
i
thought
that
my
new
clothes
amounted
to
something
but
my
goodness
when
i
saw
hers
then
alice
went
on
to
describe
the
unpacking
of
fourteen
trunks
which
had
just
come
up
from
the
that
day
couturiere
had
her
photograph
and
her
colouring
represented
in
actual
paints
and
a
figure
made
up
from
exact
measurements
and
so
every
one
of
the
garments
would
fit
her
perfectly
each
one
came
stuffed
with
tissue
paper
and
held
in
place
by
a
of
tape
and
attached
to
each
gown
was
a
piece
of
the
fabric
from
which
her
shoemaker
would
make
shoes
or
slippers
there
were
and
robes
de
chambre
and
and
wonderful
ball
and
dinner
gowns
most
of
these
latter
were
to
be
embroidered
with
jewellery
before
they
were
worn
and
imitation
jewels
were
sewn
on
to
show
how
the
real
ones
were
to
be
placed
these
garments
were
made
of
real
lace
or
parisian
embroidery
and
the
prices
paid
for
them
were
almost
impossible
to
credit
some
of
them
were
made
of
lace
so
filmy
that
the
women
who
made
them
had
to
sit
in
damp
cellars
because
the
sunlight
would
dry
the
fine
threads
and
they
would
break
a
single
yard
of
the
lace
represented
forty
days
of
labour
there
was
a
pastel
batiste
de
soie
pompadour
robe
embroidered
with
cream
silk
flowers
which
had
cost
one
thousand
dollars
there
was
a
hat
to
go
with
it
which
had
cost
a
hundred
and
and
shoes
of
grey
buckled
with
which
had
cost
forty
there
was
a
gorgeous
and
intricate
of
pale
green
chiffon
satin
with
orchids
embroidered
in
oxidized
silver
and
a
long
court
train
studded
with
diamonds
and
this
had
cost
six
thousand
dollars
without
the
jewels
and
there
was
an
which
had
cost
three
thousand
and
an
made
in
leipsic
of
white
unborn
baby
lamb
lined
with
ermine
which
had
cost
twelve
thousand
with
a
thousand
additional
for
a
hat
to
match
landis
thought
nothing
of
paying
dollars
for
a
lace
handkerchief
or
sixty
dollars
for
a
pair
of
spun
silk
hose
or
two
hundred
dollars
for
a
pearl
and
parasol
trimmed
with
cascades
of
chiffon
and
made
like
her
hats
one
for
each
gown
and
she
insists
that
these
things
are
worth
the
money
said
alice
she
says
it
not
only
the
material
in
them
but
the
ideas
each
costume
is
a
study
like
a
picture
pay
for
the
creative
genius
of
the
artist
she
said
to
me
his
ability
to
catch
my
ideas
and
apply
them
to
my
personality
my
complexion
and
hair
and
eyes
sometimes
i
design
my
own
costumes
and
so
i
know
what
hard
work
it
is
landis
came
from
one
of
new
york
oldest
families
and
she
was
wealthy
in
her
own
right
she
had
a
palace
on
fifth
avenue
and
now
that
she
had
turned
her
husband
out
she
had
nothing
at
all
to
put
in
it
except
her
clothes
alice
told
about
the
places
in
which
she
kept
them
it
was
like
a
museum
there
was
a
made
of
polished
hardwood
and
with
tier
upon
tier
of
long
poles
running
across
and
padded
hanging
from
them
everywhere
there
was
order
and
system
each
skirt
was
numbered
and
in
a
of
the
same
number
you
would
find
the
waist
and
so
on
with
hats
and
stockings
and
gloves
and
shoes
and
parasols
there
was
a
row
of
closets
having
shelves
piled
up
with
dainty
and
beribboned
lingerie
there
were
two
closets
full
of
hats
and
three
of
shoes
when
she
went
west
said
alice
one
of
her
maids
counted
and
found
that
she
had
over
four
hundred
pairs
and
she
actually
has
a
cabinet
with
a
to
keep
track
of
them
and
all
the
shelves
are
lined
with
perfumed
silk
sachets
and
she
has
tiny
sachets
sewed
in
every
skirt
and
waist
and
she
has
her
own
private
perfume
she
gave
me
some
she
calls
it
occur
de
jeannette
and
she
says
she
designed
it
herself
and
had
it
patented
and
then
alice
went
on
to
describe
the
maid
which
was
also
of
polished
hardwood
and
and
had
a
balcony
for
brushing
clothes
and
wires
upon
which
to
hang
them
and
hot
and
cold
water
and
a
big
and
an
electric
stove
but
there
ca
be
much
work
to
do
laughed
the
girl
for
she
never
wears
a
gown
more
than
two
or
three
times
just
think
of
paying
several
thousand
dollars
for
a
costume
and
giving
it
to
your
poor
relations
after
you
have
worn
it
only
twice
and
the
worst
of
it
is
that
landis
says
it
all
nothing
unusual
you
find
such
arrangements
in
every
home
of
people
who
are
socially
prominent
she
says
there
are
women
who
boast
of
never
appearing
twice
in
the
same
gown
and
there
one
dreadful
personage
in
boston
who
wears
each
costume
once
and
then
has
it
solemnly
cremated
by
her
butler
it
is
wicked
to
do
such
things
put
in
old
montague
when
she
had
heard
this
tale
through
i
do
see
how
people
can
get
any
pleasure
out
of
it
that
what
i
said
replied
alice
to
whom
did
you
say
that
asked
montague
to
mrs
landis
no
said
alice
to
a
cousin
of
hers
i
was
downstairs
waiting
for
her
and
this
girl
came
in
and
we
got
to
talking
about
it
and
i
said
that
i
did
think
i
could
ever
get
used
to
such
things
what
did
she
say
asked
the
other
she
answered
me
strangely
said
the
girl
she
tall
and
very
stately
and
i
was
a
little
bit
afraid
of
her
she
said
get
used
to
it
everybody
you
know
will
be
doing
it
and
if
you
try
to
do
differently
they
take
offence
and
you
wo
have
the
courage
to
do
without
friends
you
be
meaning
every
day
to
stop
but
you
never
will
and
you
go
on
until
you
die
what
did
you
say
to
that
nothing
answered
alice
just
then
landis
came
in
and
miss
hegan
went
away
miss
hegan
echoed
montague
yes
said
the
other
that
her
name
laura
hegan
have
you
met
her
chapter
viii
the
horse
show
was
held
in
madison
square
garden
a
building
occupying
a
whole
city
block
it
seemed
to
montague
that
during
the
four
days
he
attended
he
was
introduced
to
enough
people
to
fill
it
to
the
doors
each
one
of
the
exquisite
ladies
and
gentlemen
extended
to
him
a
delicately
gloved
hand
and
remarked
what
perfect
weather
they
were
having
and
asked
him
how
long
he
had
been
in
new
york
and
what
he
thought
of
it
then
they
would
talk
about
the
horses
and
about
the
people
who
were
present
and
what
they
had
on
he
saw
little
of
his
brother
who
was
squiring
the
walling
ladies
most
of
the
time
and
alice
too
was
generally
separated
from
him
and
taken
care
of
by
others
yet
he
was
never
alone
there
was
always
some
young
matron
ready
to
lead
him
to
her
carriage
and
whisk
him
away
to
lunch
or
dinner
many
times
he
wondered
why
people
should
be
so
kind
to
him
a
stranger
and
one
who
could
do
nothing
for
them
in
return
billy
alden
undertook
to
explain
it
to
him
one
afternoon
as
he
sat
in
her
box
there
had
to
be
some
people
to
enjoy
it
appeared
or
there
would
be
no
fun
in
the
game
everything
is
new
and
strange
to
you
said
she
and
you
delicious
and
refreshing
you
make
these
women
think
perhaps
they
ought
to
be
so
bored
after
all
here
a
woman
who
bought
a
great
painting
she
told
that
it
great
but
she
does
understand
it
herself
all
she
knows
is
that
it
cost
her
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
and
now
you
come
along
and
to
you
it
really
a
painting
and
do
you
see
how
gratifying
that
is
to
her
oliver
is
always
telling
me
it
bad
form
to
admire
said
the
man
laughing
yes
said
the
other
well
do
you
let
that
brother
of
yours
spoil
you
there
are
more
than
enough
of
blase
people
in
town
you
be
yourself
he
appreciated
the
compliment
but
added
i
afraid
that
when
the
novelty
is
worn
off
people
will
be
tired
of
me
you
find
your
place
said
alden
the
people
you
like
and
who
like
you
and
she
went
on
to
explain
that
here
he
was
being
passed
about
among
a
number
of
very
different
sets
with
different
people
and
different
tastes
society
had
become
split
up
in
that
manner
of
late
each
set
being
jealous
and
contemptuous
of
all
the
other
sets
because
of
the
fact
that
they
overlapped
a
little
at
the
edges
it
was
possible
for
him
to
meet
here
a
great
many
people
who
never
met
each
other
and
were
even
unaware
of
each
other
existence
and
alden
went
on
to
set
forth
the
difference
between
these
sets
they
ran
from
the
most
exclusive
down
to
the
most
yellow
where
they
shaded
off
into
the
disreputable
rich
of
whom
it
seemed
there
were
hordes
in
the
city
these
included
sporting
and
theatrical
and
political
people
some
of
whom
were
very
rich
indeed
and
these
sets
in
turn
shaded
off
into
the
criminals
and
the
who
might
also
easily
be
rich
some
day
said
alden
you
should
get
my
brother
to
tell
you
about
all
these
people
he
been
in
politics
you
know
and
he
has
a
and
alden
told
him
about
the
subtle
little
differences
in
the
conventions
of
these
various
sets
of
society
there
was
the
matter
of
women
smoking
for
instance
all
women
smoked
nowadays
but
some
would
do
it
only
in
their
own
apartments
with
their
women
friends
and
some
would
retire
to
an
corner
to
do
it
while
others
would
smoke
in
their
own
or
wherever
the
men
smoked
all
agreed
however
in
never
smoking
in
public
that
is
where
they
would
be
seen
by
people
not
of
their
own
set
such
at
any
rate
had
always
been
the
rule
though
a
few
daring
ones
were
beginning
to
defy
even
that
such
rules
were
very
rigid
but
they
were
purely
conventional
they
had
nothing
to
do
with
right
or
wrong
a
fact
which
alden
set
forth
with
her
usual
incisiveness
a
woman
married
or
unmarried
might
travel
with
a
man
all
over
europe
and
every
one
might
know
that
she
did
it
but
it
would
make
no
difference
so
long
as
she
did
not
do
it
in
america
there
was
one
young
matron
whom
montague
would
meet
a
raging
beauty
who
regularly
got
drunk
at
dinner
parties
and
had
to
be
escorted
to
her
carriage
by
the
butler
she
moved
in
the
most
exclusive
circles
and
every
one
treated
it
as
a
joke
unpleasant
things
like
this
did
not
hurt
a
person
unless
they
got
out
that
is
unless
they
became
a
scandal
in
the
courts
or
the
newspapers
alden
herself
had
a
cousin
whom
she
cordially
hated
who
had
gotten
a
divorce
from
her
husband
and
married
her
lover
forthwith
and
had
for
this
been
ostracized
by
society
once
when
she
came
to
some
affair
fifty
women
had
risen
at
once
and
left
the
room
she
might
have
lived
with
her
lover
both
before
and
after
the
divorce
and
every
one
might
have
known
it
and
no
one
would
have
cared
but
the
convenances
declared
that
she
should
not
marry
him
until
a
year
had
elapsed
after
the
divorce
one
thing
to
which
alden
could
testify
as
a
result
of
a
lifetime
observation
was
the
rapid
rate
at
which
these
conventions
even
the
most
essential
of
them
were
giving
way
and
being
replaced
by
a
general
do
as
you
please
anyone
could
see
that
the
power
of
women
like
devon
who
represented
the
old
regime
and
were
dignified
and
austere
and
exclusive
was
yielding
before
the
onslaught
of
new
people
who
were
bizarre
and
fantastic
and
promiscuous
and
loud
and
the
younger
sets
cared
no
more
about
anyone
nor
about
anything
under
heaven
save
to
have
a
good
time
in
their
own
ways
in
the
old
days
one
always
received
a
or
engraved
invitation
to
dinner
worded
in
impersonal
and
formal
style
but
the
other
day
alden
had
found
a
message
which
had
been
taken
from
the
telephone
please
come
to
dinner
but
do
come
unless
you
can
bring
a
man
or
we
be
thirteen
at
the
table
and
along
with
this
went
a
perfectly
incredible
increase
in
luxury
and
extravagance
you
are
surprised
at
what
you
see
here
said
she
but
take
my
word
for
it
if
you
were
to
come
back
five
years
later
you
find
all
our
present
standards
antiquated
and
our
present
sent
to
the
rear
you
find
new
hotels
and
theatres
opening
and
food
and
clothing
and
furniture
that
cost
twice
as
much
as
they
cost
now
not
so
long
ago
a
private
car
was
a
luxury
now
it
as
much
a
necessity
as
an
or
a
private
and
people
who
really
count
have
private
trains
i
can
remember
when
our
girls
wore
pretty
muslin
gowns
in
summer
and
sent
them
to
wash
now
they
wear
what
they
call
lingerie
gowns
dimity
en
princesse
with
silk
embroidery
and
real
lace
and
ribbons
that
cost
a
thousand
dollars
apiece
and
wo
years
ago
when
i
gave
a
dinner
i
invited
a
dozen
friends
and
my
own
chef
cooked
it
and
my
own
servants
served
it
now
i
have
to
pay
my
steward
ten
thousand
a
year
and
nothing
that
i
have
is
good
enough
i
have
to
ask
forty
or
fifty
people
and
i
call
in
a
caterer
and
he
brings
everything
of
his
own
and
my
servants
go
off
and
get
drunk
you
used
to
get
a
good
dinner
for
ten
dollars
a
plate
and
fifteen
was
something
special
but
now
you
hear
of
dinners
that
cost
a
thousand
a
plate
and
it
not
enough
to
have
beautiful
flowers
on
the
table
you
have
to
have
there
must
be
a
rural
landscape
for
a
background
and
goldfish
in
the
and
five
thousand
dollars
worth
of
florida
orchids
on
the
table
and
floral
favours
of
roses
that
cost
a
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
a
dozen
i
attended
a
dinner
at
the
waldorf
last
year
that
had
cost
fifty
thousand
dollars
and
when
i
ask
those
people
to
see
me
i
have
to
give
them
as
good
as
i
got
the
other
day
i
paid
a
thousand
dollars
for
a
tablecloth
why
do
you
do
it
asked
montague
abruptly
god
knows
said
the
other
i
do
i
sometimes
wonder
myself
i
guess
it
because
i
nothing
else
to
do
it
like
the
story
they
tell
about
my
brother
he
was
losing
money
in
a
in
saratoga
and
some
one
said
to
him
why
do
you
go
there
you
know
the
game
is
crooked
course
it
crooked
said
he
damn
it
it
the
only
game
in
town
the
pressure
is
more
than
anyone
can
stand
said
alden
after
a
moment
thought
it
like
trying
to
swim
against
a
current
you
have
to
float
and
do
what
every
one
expects
you
to
do
your
children
and
your
friends
and
your
servants
and
your
tradespeople
all
the
world
is
in
a
conspiracy
against
you
it
appalling
to
me
said
the
man
yes
said
the
other
and
there
never
any
end
to
it
you
think
you
know
it
all
but
you
find
you
really
know
very
little
just
think
of
the
number
of
people
there
are
trying
to
go
the
pace
they
say
there
are
seven
thousand
millionaires
in
this
country
but
i
say
there
are
twenty
thousand
in
new
york
alone
or
if
they
do
own
a
million
they
spending
the
income
of
it
which
amounts
to
the
same
thing
you
can
figure
that
a
man
who
pays
ten
thousand
a
year
for
rent
is
paying
fifty
thousand
to
live
and
there
fifth
avenue
two
miles
of
it
if
you
count
the
uptown
and
downtown
parts
and
there
madison
avenue
and
half
a
dozen
houses
adjoining
on
every
side
street
and
then
there
are
the
hotels
and
apartment
houses
to
say
nothing
of
the
west
side
and
riverside
drive
and
you
meet
these
mobs
of
people
in
the
shops
and
the
hotels
and
the
theatres
and
they
all
want
to
be
better
dressed
than
you
i
saw
a
woman
here
that
i
never
saw
in
my
life
before
and
i
heard
her
say
she
paid
two
thousand
dollars
for
a
lace
handkerchief
and
it
might
have
been
true
for
i
been
asked
to
pay
ten
thousand
for
a
lace
shawl
at
a
bargain
it
a
common
enough
thing
to
see
a
woman
walking
on
fifth
avenue
with
twenty
or
thirty
thousand
dollars
worth
of
furs
on
her
fifty
thousand
is
often
paid
for
a
coat
of
sable
and
i
know
of
one
that
cost
two
hundred
thousand
i
know
women
who
have
a
dozen
sets
of
furs
ermine
chinchilla
black
fox
baby
lamb
and
mink
and
sable
and
i
know
a
man
whose
chauffeur
quit
him
because
he
would
buy
him
a
fur
coat
and
once
people
used
to
pack
their
furs
away
and
take
care
of
them
but
now
they
wear
them
about
the
street
or
at
the
and
you
can
fairly
see
them
fade
or
else
their
cut
goes
out
of
fashion
and
so
they
have
to
have
new
ones
all
that
was
material
for
thought
it
was
all
true
there
was
no
question
about
that
it
seemed
to
be
the
rule
that
whenever
you
questioned
a
tale
of
the
extravagances
of
new
york
you
would
hear
the
next
day
of
something
several
times
more
startling
montague
was
staggered
at
the
idea
of
a
fur
coat
and
yet
not
long
afterward
there
arrived
in
the
city
a
titled
englishwoman
who
owned
a
coat
worth
a
million
dollars
which
insurance
companies
had
insured
for
half
a
million
it
was
made
of
the
soft
plumage
of
rare
hawaiian
birds
and
had
taken
twenty
years
to
make
each
feather
was
and
there
were
wonderful
designs
in
crimson
and
gold
and
black
every
day
in
the
casual
conversation
of
your
acquaintances
you
heard
of
similar
incredible
things
a
tiny
antique
persian
rug
which
could
be
folded
into
an
overcoat
pocket
for
ten
thousand
dollars
a
set
of
five
art
fans
each
blade
painted
by
a
famous
artist
and
costing
thousand
dollars
a
crystal
cup
for
eighty
thousand
an
edition
de
luxe
of
the
works
of
dickens
for
a
hundred
thousand
a
ruby
the
size
of
a
pigeon
egg
for
three
hundred
thousand
in
some
of
these
great
new
york
palaces
there
were
fountains
which
cost
a
hundred
dollars
a
minute
to
run
and
in
the
harbour
there
were
yachts
which
cost
twenty
thousand
a
month
to
keep
in
commission
and
that
same
day
as
it
chanced
he
learned
of
a
kind
of
squandering
he
went
home
to
lunch
with
winnie
duval
and
there
met
caroline
smythe
with
whom
he
had
talked
at
castle
havens
smythe
whose
husband
had
been
a
wall
street
plunger
was
soft
and
mushy
and
very
gushing
in
manner
and
she
asked
him
to
come
home
to
dinner
with
her
adding
i
introduce
you
to
my
babies
from
what
montague
had
so
far
seen
he
judged
that
babies
played
a
very
small
part
in
the
lives
of
the
women
of
society
and
so
he
was
interested
and
asked
how
many
have
you
only
two
in
town
said
smythe
i
just
come
up
you
see
how
old
are
they
he
inquired
politely
and
when
the
lady
added
about
two
years
he
asked
wo
they
be
in
bed
by
dinner
time
oh
my
no
said
smythe
the
dear
little
lambs
wait
up
for
me
i
always
find
them
scratching
at
my
chamber
door
and
wagging
their
little
tails
then
winnie
laughed
merrily
and
said
why
do
you
fool
him
and
went
on
to
inform
montague
that
caroline
babies
were
griffons
bruxelloises
griffons
suggested
to
him
vague
ideas
of
dragons
and
unicorns
and
gargoyles
but
he
said
nothing
more
save
to
accept
the
invitation
and
that
evening
he
discovered
that
griffons
bruxelloises
were
tiny
dogs
yellow
and
fluffy
and
that
for
her
two
priceless
treasures
smythe
had
an
expert
nurse
to
whom
she
paid
a
hundred
dollars
a
month
and
also
a
footman
and
a
special
cuisine
in
which
their
complicated
food
was
prepared
they
had
a
regular
dentist
and
a
physician
and
gold
plate
to
eat
from
smythe
also
owned
two
bernards
of
a
very
rare
breed
and
a
fierce
great
dane
and
a
very
fat
boston
bull
pup
the
last
having
been
trained
to
go
for
an
airing
all
alone
in
her
carriage
with
a
solemn
coachman
and
footman
to
drive
him
montague
deftly
keeping
the
conversation
upon
the
subject
of
pets
learned
that
all
this
was
quite
common
many
women
in
society
artificially
made
themselves
barren
because
of
the
inconvenience
incidental
to
pregnancy
and
motherhood
and
instead
they
lavished
their
affections
upon
cats
and
dogs
some
of
these
animals
had
elaborate
costumes
rivalling
in
expensiveness
those
of
their
they
wore
tiny
boots
which
cost
eight
dollars
a
pair
house
boots
and
street
boots
lacing
up
to
the
knees
they
had
dusters
sweaters
coats
lined
with
ermine
and
automobile
coats
with
head
and
and
hoods
and
goggles
and
each
coat
fitted
with
a
pocket
for
its
tiny
handkerchief
of
fine
linen
or
lace
and
they
had
collars
set
with
rubies
and
pearls
and
diamonds
one
had
a
collar
that
cost
ten
thousand
dollars
sometimes
there
would
be
a
coat
to
match
every
gown
of
the
owner
there
were
dog
nurseries
and
in
which
they
might
be
left
temporarily
and
manicure
parlours
for
cats
with
a
physician
in
charge
when
these
pets
died
there
was
an
expensive
cemetery
in
brooklyn
especially
for
their
interment
and
they
would
be
duly
embalmed
and
buried
in
casket
and
would
have
costly
marble
monuments
when
one
of
smythe
best
loved
pugs
had
fallen
ill
of
congestion
of
the
liver
she
had
had
put
upon
the
street
in
front
of
her
house
and
when
in
spite
of
this
the
dog
died
she
had
sent
out
cards
edged
in
black
inviting
her
friends
to
a
memorial
service
also
she
showed
montague
a
number
of
books
with
very
costly
bindings
in
which
were
demonstrated
the
unity
simplicity
and
immortality
of
the
souls
of
cats
and
dogs
apparently
the
sentimental
smythe
was
willing
to
talk
about
these
pets
all
through
dinner
and
so
was
her
aunt
a
thin
and
angular
spinster
who
sat
on
montague
other
side
and
he
was
willing
to
listen
he
wanted
to
know
it
all
there
were
umbrellas
for
dogs
to
be
fastened
over
their
backs
in
wet
weather
there
were
manicure
and
toilet
sets
and
silver
and
whips
there
were
sets
of
engraved
there
were
in
which
invalid
cats
and
dogs
might
be
taken
for
an
airing
there
were
shows
for
cats
and
dogs
with
pedigrees
and
prizes
and
nearly
as
great
crowds
as
the
horse
show
smythe
bernards
were
worth
seven
thousand
dollars
apiece
and
there
were
worth
twice
that
there
was
a
woman
who
had
come
all
the
way
from
the
pacific
coast
to
have
a
specialist
perform
an
operation
upon
the
throat
of
her
yorkshire
terrier
there
was
another
who
had
built
for
her
dog
a
tiny
queen
anne
cottage
with
rooms
papered
and
carpeted
and
hung
with
lace
curtains
once
a
young
man
of
fashion
had
come
to
the
waldorf
and
registered
himself
and
miss
elsie
cochrane
and
when
the
clerk
made
the
usual
inquiries
as
to
the
relationship
of
the
young
lady
it
transpired
that
miss
elsie
was
a
dog
arrayed
in
a
prim
little
and
requiring
a
room
to
herself
and
then
there
was
a
tale
of
a
cat
which
had
inherited
a
from
a
estate
it
had
a
apartment
and
several
attendants
and
sat
at
table
and
ate
shrimps
and
italian
chestnuts
and
had
a
velvet
couch
for
naps
and
a
basket
for
sleeping
at
night
four
days
of
horses
were
enough
for
montague
and
on
friday
morning
when
siegfried
harvey
called
him
up
and
asked
if
he
and
alice
would
come
out
to
the
roost
for
the
he
accepted
gladly
charlie
carter
was
going
and
volunteered
to
take
them
in
his
car
and
so
again
they
crossed
the
williamsburg
bridge
the
jewish
passover
as
charlie
called
it
and
went
out
on
long
island
montague
was
very
anxious
to
get
a
line
on
charlie
carter
for
he
had
not
been
prepared
for
the
startling
promptness
with
which
this
young
man
had
fallen
at
alice
feet
it
was
so
obvious
that
everybody
was
smiling
over
it
he
was
with
her
every
minute
that
he
could
arrange
it
and
he
turned
up
at
every
place
to
which
she
was
invited
both
winnie
and
oliver
were
quite
evidently
complacent
but
montague
was
by
no
means
the
same
charlie
had
struck
him
as
a
but
rather
weak
youth
inclined
to
melancholy
he
was
never
without
a
cigarette
in
his
fingers
and
there
had
been
signs
that
he
was
not
quite
proof
against
the
pitfalls
which
society
set
about
him
in
the
shape
of
decanters
and
though
in
a
world
where
the
fragrance
of
spirits
was
never
out
of
one
nostrils
and
where
people
drank
with
such
perplexing
frequency
it
was
hard
to
know
where
to
draw
a
line
you
wo
find
my
place
like
havens
siegfried
harvey
had
said
it
is
real
country
montague
found
it
the
most
attractive
of
all
the
homes
he
had
seen
so
far
it
was
a
big
rambling
house
all
in
rustic
style
with
great
hewn
logs
outside
and
rafters
within
and
a
winding
oak
stairway
and
any
number
of
dens
and
cosy
corners
and
broad
with
mountains
of
pillows
everything
here
was
built
for
comfort
there
was
a
and
a
and
a
real
library
with
readable
books
and
great
chairs
in
which
one
sank
out
of
sight
there
were
log
fires
blazing
everywhere
and
pictures
on
the
walls
that
told
of
sport
and
no
end
of
guns
and
antlers
and
trophies
of
all
sorts
but
you
were
not
to
suppose
that
all
this
elaborate
rusticity
would
be
any
excuse
for
the
absence
of
attendants
in
livery
and
a
chef
who
boasted
the
cordon
bleu
and
a
resplendent
with
crystal
and
silver
and
orchids
and
ferns
after
all
though
the
host
called
it
a
small
place
he
had
invited
twenty
guests
and
he
had
a
hunter
in
his
stables
for
each
one
of
them
but
the
most
wonderful
thing
about
the
roost
was
the
fact
that
at
a
touch
of
a
button
all
the
walls
of
the
lower
rooms
vanished
into
the
second
story
and
there
was
one
huge
room
with
violins
tuning
up
and
calling
to
one
feet
they
set
a
fast
pace
here
the
dancing
lasted
until
three
and
at
dawn
again
they
were
dressed
and
mounted
and
following
the
grooms
and
the
hounds
across
the
fields
montague
was
half
prepared
for
a
tame
fox
but
this
was
spared
him
there
was
a
real
game
it
seemed
and
soon
the
pack
gave
tongue
and
away
went
the
hunt
it
was
the
wildest
ride
that
montague
ever
had
taken
over
ditches
and
streams
and
innumerable
and
through
thick
coverts
and
densely
populated
barnyards
but
he
was
in
at
the
death
and
alice
was
only
a
few
yards
behind
to
the
immense
delight
of
the
company
this
seemed
to
montague
the
first
real
life
he
had
met
and
he
thought
to
himself
that
these
and
men
and
women
made
a
set
into
which
he
would
have
been
glad
to
fit
save
only
that
he
had
to
earn
his
living
and
they
did
not
in
the
afternoon
there
was
more
riding
and
walks
in
the
crisp
november
air
and
indoors
bridge
and
rackets
and
and
a
fast
and
furious
game
of
roulette
with
the
host
as
banker
do
i
look
much
like
a
professional
gambler
he
asked
of
montague
and
when
the
other
replied
that
he
had
not
yet
met
any
new
york
gamblers
young
harvey
went
on
to
tell
how
he
had
gone
to
buy
this
apparatus
the
sale
of
which
was
forbidden
by
law
and
had
been
asked
by
the
dealer
how
strong
he
wanted
it
then
in
the
evening
there
was
more
dancing
and
on
sunday
another
hunt
that
night
a
gambling
mood
seemed
to
seize
the
company
there
were
two
bridge
tables
and
in
another
room
the
most
reckless
game
of
poker
that
montague
had
ever
sat
in
it
broke
up
at
three
in
the
morning
and
one
of
the
company
wrote
him
a
cheque
for
hundred
dollars
but
even
that
could
not
entirely
smooth
his
conscience
nor
reconcile
him
to
the
fever
that
was
in
his
blood
most
important
to
him
however
was
the
fact
that
during
the
game
he
at
last
got
to
know
charlie
carter
charlie
did
not
play
for
the
reason
that
he
was
drunk
and
one
of
the
company
told
him
so
and
refused
to
play
with
him
which
left
poor
charlie
nothing
to
do
but
get
drunker
this
he
did
and
came
and
hung
over
the
shoulders
of
the
players
and
told
the
company
all
about
himself
montague
was
prepared
to
allow
for
the
wild
oats
of
a
youngster
with
unlimited
money
but
never
in
his
life
had
he
heard
or
dreamed
of
anything
like
this
boy
for
half
an
hour
he
wandered
about
the
table
and
poured
out
a
steady
stream
of
obscenities
his
mind
was
like
a
swamp
in
which
dwelt
loathsome
and
hideous
serpents
which
came
to
the
surface
at
night
and
showed
their
flat
heads
and
their
slimy
coils
in
the
heavens
above
or
the
earth
beneath
there
was
nothing
sacred
to
him
there
was
nothing
too
revolting
to
be
spewed
out
and
the
company
accepted
the
performance
as
an
old
story
the
men
would
laugh
and
push
the
boy
away
and
say
oh
charlie
go
to
the
devil
after
it
was
all
over
montague
took
one
of
the
company
aside
and
asked
him
what
it
meant
to
which
the
man
replied
good
god
do
you
mean
that
nobody
has
told
you
about
charlie
carter
it
appeared
that
charlie
was
one
of
the
gilded
youths
of
the
tenderloin
whose
exploits
had
been
celebrated
in
the
papers
and
after
the
attendants
had
bundled
him
off
to
bed
several
of
the
men
gathered
about
the
fire
and
sipped
hot
punch
and
rehearsed
for
benefit
some
of
his
leading
exploits
charlie
was
only
it
seemed
and
when
he
was
ten
his
father
had
died
and
left
eight
or
ten
millions
in
trust
for
him
in
the
care
of
a
poor
foolish
aunt
whom
he
twisted
about
his
finger
at
the
age
of
twelve
he
was
a
cigarette
fiend
and
had
the
run
of
the
when
he
went
to
a
rich
private
school
he
took
whole
trunks
full
of
cigarettes
with
him
and
finally
ran
away
to
europe
to
acquire
the
learning
of
the
brothels
of
paris
and
then
he
came
home
and
struck
the
tenderloin
and
at
three
one
morning
he
walked
through
a
window
and
so
the
newspapers
took
him
up
that
had
suddenly
opened
a
new
vista
in
life
for
charlie
he
became
a
devotee
of
fame
everywhere
he
went
he
was
followed
by
newspaper
reporters
and
a
staring
crowd
he
carried
wads
as
big
round
as
his
arm
and
gave
away
tips
to
bootblacks
and
lost
forty
thousand
dollars
in
a
game
of
poker
he
gave
a
fete
to
the
with
a
jewelled
christmas
tree
in
midsummer
and
fifty
thousand
dollars
worth
of
splendour
but
the
greatest
stroke
of
all
was
the
announcement
that
he
was
going
to
build
a
submarine
yacht
and
fill
it
with
now
charlie
had
sunk
out
of
public
attention
and
his
friends
would
not
see
him
for
days
he
would
be
lying
in
a
sporting
house
literally
wallowing
in
champagne
and
all
this
montague
realized
his
brother
must
have
known
and
he
had
said
not
a
word
about
it
because
of
the
eight
or
ten
millions
which
charlie
would
have
when
he
was
chapter
ix
in
the
morning
they
went
home
with
others
of
the
party
by
train
they
could
not
wait
for
charlie
and
his
automobile
because
monday
was
the
opening
night
of
the
opera
and
no
one
could
miss
that
here
society
would
appear
in
its
most
gorgeous
raiment
and
there
would
be
a
show
of
jewellery
such
as
could
be
seen
nowhere
else
in
the
world
general
prentice
and
his
wife
had
opened
their
and
had
invited
them
to
dinner
and
to
share
their
box
and
so
at
about
nine
montague
found
himself
seated
in
a
great
balcony
of
the
shape
of
a
horseshoe
with
several
hundred
of
the
richest
people
in
the
city
there
was
another
tier
of
boxes
above
and
three
galleries
above
that
and
a
thousand
or
more
people
seated
and
standing
below
him
upon
the
big
stage
there
was
an
elaborate
and
showy
play
the
words
of
which
were
sung
to
the
accompaniment
of
an
orchestra
now
montague
had
never
heard
an
opera
and
he
was
fond
of
music
the
second
act
had
just
begun
when
he
came
in
and
all
through
it
he
sat
quite
spellbound
listening
to
the
most
ravishing
strains
that
ever
he
had
heard
in
his
life
he
scarcely
noticed
that
prentice
was
spending
her
time
studying
the
occupants
of
the
other
boxes
through
a
jewelled
lorgnette
or
that
oliver
was
chattering
to
her
daughter
but
after
the
act
was
over
oliver
got
him
alone
outside
the
box
and
whispered
for
god
sake
allan
do
make
a
fool
of
yourself
why
what
the
matter
asked
the
other
what
will
people
think
exclaimed
oliver
seeing
you
sitting
there
like
a
man
in
a
dope
dream
why
laughed
the
other
they
think
i
listening
to
the
music
to
which
oliver
responded
people
do
come
to
the
opera
to
listen
to
the
music
this
sounded
like
a
joke
but
it
was
not
to
society
the
opera
was
a
great
state
function
an
exhibition
of
far
more
exclusiveness
and
magnificence
than
the
horse
show
and
society
certainly
had
the
right
to
say
for
it
owned
the
and
ran
it
the
real
who
came
either
stood
up
in
the
back
or
sat
in
the
fifth
gallery
close
to
the
ceiling
where
the
air
was
foul
and
hot
how
much
society
cared
about
the
play
was
sufficiently
indicated
by
the
fact
that
all
of
the
operas
were
sung
in
foreign
languages
and
sung
so
carelessly
that
the
few
who
understood
the
languages
could
make
but
little
of
the
words
once
there
was
a
who
devoted
his
life
to
trying
to
make
the
opera
an
art
and
in
the
battle
with
society
he
all
but
starved
to
death
now
after
half
a
century
his
genius
had
triumphed
and
society
consented
to
sit
for
hours
in
darkness
and
listen
to
the
domestic
disputes
of
german
gods
and
goddesses
but
what
society
really
cared
for
was
a
play
with
beautiful
costumes
and
scenery
and
dancing
and
pretty
songs
to
which
one
could
listen
while
one
talked
the
story
must
be
elemental
and
passionate
so
that
one
could
understand
it
in
pantomime
say
the
tragic
love
of
a
beautiful
and
courtesan
for
a
gallant
young
man
of
fashion
nearly
every
one
who
came
to
the
opera
had
a
glass
by
means
of
which
he
could
bring
each
society
dame
close
to
him
and
study
her
at
leisure
there
were
said
to
be
two
hundred
million
dollars
worth
of
diamonds
in
new
york
and
those
that
were
not
in
the
stores
were
very
apt
to
be
at
this
show
for
here
was
where
they
could
accomplish
the
purpose
for
which
they
existed
here
was
where
all
the
world
came
to
stare
at
them
there
were
nine
prominent
society
women
who
among
them
displayed
five
million
dollars
worth
of
jewels
you
would
see
stomachers
which
looked
like
a
piece
of
a
coat
of
mail
and
were
made
wholly
of
blazing
diamonds
you
would
see
emeralds
and
rubies
and
diamonds
and
pearls
made
in
tiaras
that
is
to
say
imitation
crowns
and
coronets
and
exhibited
with
a
stout
and
solemn
dowager
for
a
pediment
one
of
the
wallings
had
set
this
fashion
and
now
every
one
of
importance
wore
them
one
lady
to
whom
montague
was
introduced
made
a
speciality
of
pearls
two
black
pearl
at
forty
thousand
dollars
a
string
at
three
hundred
thousand
a
brooch
of
pink
pearls
at
fifty
thousand
and
two
necklaces
at
a
quarter
of
a
million
each
this
incessant
repetition
of
the
prices
of
things
came
to
seem
very
sordid
but
montague
found
that
there
was
no
getting
away
from
it
the
people
in
society
who
paid
these
prices
affected
to
be
above
all
such
considerations
to
be
interested
only
in
the
beauty
and
artistic
excellence
of
the
things
themselves
but
one
found
that
they
always
talked
about
the
prices
which
other
people
had
paid
and
that
somehow
other
people
always
knew
what
they
had
paid
they
took
care
also
to
see
that
the
public
and
the
newspapers
knew
what
they
had
paid
and
knew
everything
else
that
they
were
doing
at
this
opera
for
instance
there
was
a
diagram
of
the
boxes
printed
upon
the
programme
and
a
list
of
all
the
so
that
anyone
could
tell
who
was
who
you
might
see
these
great
dames
in
their
gorgeous
robes
coming
from
their
carriages
with
crowds
staring
at
them
and
detectives
hovering
about
and
the
bosom
of
each
would
be
throbbing
with
a
wild
and
wonderful
vision
of
the
moment
when
she
would
enter
her
box
and
the
music
would
be
forgotten
and
all
eyes
would
be
turned
upon
her
and
she
would
lay
aside
her
wraps
and
flash
upon
the
staring
throngs
a
vision
of
dazzling
splendour
some
of
these
jewels
were
family
treasures
well
known
to
new
york
for
generations
and
in
such
cases
it
was
becoming
the
fashion
to
leave
the
real
jewels
in
the
vault
and
to
wear
imitation
stones
exactly
like
them
from
homes
where
the
jewels
were
kept
detectives
were
never
absent
and
in
many
cases
there
were
detectives
watching
the
detectives
and
yet
every
once
in
a
while
the
newspapers
would
be
full
of
a
sensational
story
of
a
robbery
then
the
unfortunates
who
chanced
to
be
suspected
would
be
seized
by
the
police
and
subjected
to
what
was
jocularly
termed
the
third
degree
and
consisted
of
tortures
as
elaborate
and
cruel
as
any
which
the
spanish
inquisition
had
invented
the
advertising
value
of
this
kind
of
thing
was
found
to
be
so
great
that
famous
actresses
also
had
costly
jewels
and
now
and
then
would
have
them
stolen
that
night
when
they
had
got
home
montague
had
a
talk
with
his
cousin
about
charlie
carter
he
discovered
a
peculiar
situation
it
seemed
that
alice
already
knew
that
charlie
had
been
bad
he
was
sick
and
miserable
and
her
beauty
and
innocence
had
touched
him
and
made
him
ashamed
of
himself
and
he
had
hinted
darkly
at
dreadful
evils
thus
carefully
veiled
and
tinged
with
mystery
and
romance
montague
could
understand
how
charlie
made
an
interesting
and
appealing
figure
he
says
i
different
from
any
girl
he
ever
met
said
alice
a
remark
of
such
striking
originality
that
her
cousin
could
not
keep
back
his
smile
alice
was
not
the
least
bit
in
love
with
him
and
had
no
idea
of
being
and
she
said
that
she
would
accept
no
invitations
and
never
go
alone
with
him
but
she
did
not
see
how
she
could
avoid
him
when
she
met
him
at
other
people
houses
and
to
this
montague
had
to
assent
general
prentice
had
inquired
kindly
as
to
what
montague
had
seen
in
new
york
and
how
he
was
getting
along
he
added
that
he
had
talked
about
him
to
judge
ellis
and
that
when
he
was
ready
to
get
to
work
the
judge
would
perhaps
have
some
suggestions
to
make
to
him
he
approved
however
of
montague
plan
of
getting
his
bearings
first
and
said
that
he
would
introduce
him
and
put
him
up
at
a
couple
of
the
leading
clubs
all
this
remained
in
montague
mind
but
there
was
no
use
trying
to
think
of
it
at
the
moment
thanksgiving
was
at
hand
and
in
countless
country
mansions
there
would
be
gaieties
under
way
bertie
stuyvesant
had
planned
an
excursion
to
his
adirondack
camp
and
had
invited
a
score
or
so
of
young
people
including
the
montagues
this
would
be
a
new
feature
of
the
city
life
worth
knowing
about
their
expedition
began
with
a
bertie
had
engaged
four
boxes
and
they
met
there
an
hour
or
so
after
the
performance
had
begun
this
made
no
difference
however
for
the
play
was
like
the
number
of
songs
and
dances
strung
together
and
with
only
plot
enough
to
provide
occasion
for
elaborate
scenery
and
costumes
from
the
play
they
were
carried
to
the
grand
central
station
and
a
little
before
midnight
bertie
private
train
set
out
on
its
journey
this
train
was
a
completely
equipped
hotel
there
was
a
baggage
compartment
and
a
and
kitchen
and
a
and
and
a
not
with
berths
such
as
the
ordinary
provides
but
with
comfortable
bedrooms
furnished
in
white
mahogany
and
provided
with
running
water
and
electric
light
all
these
cars
were
built
of
steel
and
automatically
ventilated
and
they
were
furnished
in
the
luxurious
fashion
of
everything
with
which
bertie
stuyvesant
had
anything
to
do
in
the
there
were
velvet
carpets
upon
the
floor
and
furniture
of
south
american
mahogany
and
paintings
upon
the
walls
over
which
great
artists
had
laboured
for
years
bertie
chef
and
servants
were
on
board
and
a
supper
was
ready
in
the
which
they
ate
while
watching
the
hudson
by
moonlight
and
the
next
morning
they
reached
their
destination
a
little
station
in
the
mountain
wilderness
the
train
lay
upon
a
switch
and
so
they
had
breakfast
at
their
leisure
and
then
bundled
in
furs
came
out
into
the
crisp
air
of
the
woods
there
was
snow
upon
the
ground
and
eight
big
sleighs
waiting
and
for
nearly
three
hours
they
drove
in
the
frosty
sunlight
through
most
beautiful
mountain
scenery
a
good
part
of
the
drive
was
in
bertie
preserve
and
the
road
was
private
as
big
signs
notified
one
every
hundred
yards
or
so
so
at
last
they
reached
a
lake
winding
like
a
snake
among
towering
hills
and
with
a
huge
baronial
castle
standing
out
upon
the
rocky
shore
this
imitation
fortress
was
the
camp
bertie
father
had
built
it
and
visited
it
only
half
a
dozen
times
in
his
life
bertie
himself
had
only
been
here
twice
he
said
the
deer
were
so
plentiful
that
in
the
winter
they
died
in
scores
nevertheless
there
were
thirty
to
guard
the
ten
thousand
acres
of
forest
and
prevent
anyone
hunting
in
it
there
were
many
such
preserves
in
this
adirondack
wilderness
so
montague
was
told
one
man
had
a
whole
mountain
fenced
about
with
heavy
iron
railing
and
had
moose
and
elk
and
even
wild
boar
inside
and
as
for
the
camps
there
were
so
many
that
a
new
style
of
architecture
had
been
developed
here
to
say
nothing
of
those
which
followed
old
styles
like
this
imported
rhine
castle
one
of
bertie
crowd
had
a
big
swiss
chalet
and
one
of
the
wallings
had
a
japanese
palace
to
which
he
came
every
august
a
house
which
had
been
built
from
plans
drawn
in
japan
and
by
labourers
imported
especially
from
japan
it
was
full
of
japanese
ware
furniture
tapestry
and
mosaics
and
the
guides
remembered
with
wonder
the
strange
silent
little
men
who
had
laboured
for
days
at
carving
a
bit
of
wood
and
had
built
a
tiny
with
more
bits
of
wood
in
it
than
a
man
could
count
in
a
week
they
had
a
luncheon
of
fresh
venison
and
partridges
and
trout
and
in
the
afternoon
a
hunt
the
more
active
set
out
to
track
the
deer
in
the
snow
but
most
prepared
to
watch
the
while
the
turned
loose
the
dogs
back
in
the
hills
this
hounding
was
against
the
law
but
bertie
was
his
own
law
here
and
at
the
worst
there
could
simply
be
a
small
fine
imposed
upon
some
of
the
keepers
they
drove
eight
or
ten
deer
to
water
and
as
they
fired
as
many
as
twenty
shots
at
one
deer
they
had
quite
a
lively
time
then
at
dusk
they
came
back
in
a
fine
glow
of
excitement
and
spent
the
evening
before
the
blazing
logs
telling
over
their
adventures
the
party
spent
two
days
and
a
half
here
and
on
the
last
evening
which
was
thanksgiving
they
had
a
wild
turkey
which
bertie
had
shot
the
week
before
in
virginia
and
were
entertained
by
a
minstrel
show
which
had
been
brought
up
from
new
york
the
night
before
the
next
afternoon
they
drove
back
to
the
train
in
the
morning
when
they
reached
the
city
alice
found
a
note
from
winnie
duval
begging
her
and
montague
to
come
to
lunch
and
attend
a
private
lecture
by
the
swami
babubanana
who
would
tell
them
all
about
the
previous
states
of
their
souls
they
went
though
not
without
a
protest
from
old
montague
who
declared
it
was
worse
than
bob
ingersoll
and
then
in
the
evening
came
de
graffenried
opening
entertainment
which
was
one
of
the
great
events
of
the
social
year
in
the
general
rush
of
things
montague
had
not
had
a
chance
properly
to
realize
it
but
reggie
mann
and
de
graffenried
had
been
working
over
it
for
weeks
when
the
montagues
arrived
they
found
the
riverside
mansion
which
was
decorated
in
imitation
of
an
arabian
palace
turned
into
a
jungle
of
tropical
plants
they
had
come
early
at
reggie
request
and
he
introduced
them
to
de
graffenried
a
tall
and
angular
lady
with
a
leathern
complexion
painfully
painted
de
graffenried
was
about
fifty
years
of
age
but
like
all
the
women
of
society
she
was
made
up
for
thirty
just
at
present
there
were
beads
of
perspiration
upon
her
forehead
something
had
gone
wrong
at
the
last
moment
and
so
reggie
would
have
no
time
to
show
them
the
favours
as
he
had
intended
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
guests
were
invited
to
this
entertainment
a
supper
was
served
at
little
tables
in
the
great
and
afterward
the
guests
wandered
about
the
house
while
the
tables
were
whisked
out
of
the
way
and
the
room
turned
into
a
a
company
from
one
of
the
broadway
theatres
would
be
bundled
into
cabs
at
the
end
of
the
performance
and
by
midnight
they
would
be
ready
to
repeat
the
performance
at
de
graffenried
montague
chanced
to
be
near
when
this
company
arrived
and
he
observed
that
the
guests
had
crowded
up
too
close
and
not
left
room
enough
for
the
actors
so
the
manager
had
placed
them
in
a
little
and
when
de
graffenried
observed
this
she
rushed
at
the
man
and
swore
at
him
like
a
dragoon
and
ordered
the
bewildered
performers
out
into
the
main
room
but
this
was
peering
behind
the
scenes
and
he
was
supposed
to
be
watching
the
play
the
entertainment
was
another
musical
comedy
like
the
one
he
had
seen
a
few
nights
before
on
that
occasion
however
bertie
stuyvesant
sister
had
talked
to
him
the
whole
time
while
now
he
was
let
alone
and
had
a
chance
to
watch
the
performance
this
was
a
very
popular
play
it
had
had
a
long
run
and
the
papers
told
how
its
author
had
an
income
of
a
couple
of
hundred
thousand
dollars
a
year
and
here
was
an
audience
of
the
most
rich
and
influential
people
in
the
city
and
they
laughed
and
clapped
and
made
it
clear
that
they
were
enjoying
themselves
heartily
and
what
sort
of
a
play
was
it
it
was
called
the
kaliph
of
kamskatka
it
had
no
shred
of
a
plot
the
kaliph
had
seventeen
wives
and
there
was
an
american
drummer
who
wanted
to
sell
him
another
but
then
you
did
not
need
to
remember
this
for
nothing
came
of
it
there
was
nothing
in
the
play
which
could
be
called
a
character
there
was
nothing
which
could
be
connected
with
any
real
emotion
ever
felt
by
human
beings
nor
could
one
say
that
there
was
any
incident
at
least
nothing
happened
because
of
anything
else
each
event
was
a
separate
thing
like
the
spasmodic
jerking
in
the
face
of
an
idiot
of
this
sort
of
action
there
was
any
quantity
at
an
instant
notice
every
one
on
the
stage
would
fall
simultaneously
into
this
condition
of
idiotic
jerking
there
was
rushing
about
shouting
laughing
exclaiming
the
stage
was
in
a
continual
uproar
of
excitement
which
was
without
any
reason
or
meaning
so
it
was
impossible
to
think
of
the
actors
in
their
parts
one
kept
thinking
of
them
as
human
beings
thinking
of
the
awful
tragedy
of
men
and
women
being
compelled
by
the
pressure
of
hunger
to
dress
up
and
paint
themselves
and
then
come
out
in
public
and
dance
stamp
leap
about
wring
their
hands
make
faces
and
otherwise
be
lively
the
costumes
were
of
two
sorts
one
fantastic
supposed
to
represent
the
east
and
the
other
a
kind
of
reductio
ad
absurdum
of
fashionable
garb
the
leading
man
wore
a
natty
and
strutted
with
a
little
cane
his
was
a
jaunty
air
a
kind
of
perpetual
flourish
and
a
wink
that
suggested
the
cunning
of
a
satyr
the
leading
lady
changed
her
costume
several
times
in
each
act
but
it
invariably
contained
the
elements
of
bare
arms
and
bosom
and
back
and
a
skirt
which
did
not
reach
her
knees
and
silk
stockings
and
slippers
with
heels
two
inches
high
upon
the
least
provocation
she
would
execute
a
little
pirouette
which
would
reveal
the
rest
of
her
legs
surrounded
by
a
mass
of
lace
ruffles
it
is
the
nature
of
the
human
mind
to
seek
the
end
of
things
if
this
woman
had
worn
a
suit
of
tights
and
nothing
else
she
would
have
been
as
uninteresting
as
an
underwear
advertisement
in
a
magazine
but
this
incessant
of
herself
exerted
a
subtle
fascination
at
frequent
intervals
the
orchestra
would
start
up
a
jerky
little
tune
and
the
two
stars
would
begin
to
sing
in
nasal
voices
some
words
expressive
of
passion
then
the
man
would
take
the
woman
about
the
waist
and
dance
and
swing
her
about
and
bend
her
backward
and
gaze
into
her
eyes
actions
all
vaguely
suggestive
of
the
relationship
of
sex
at
the
end
of
the
verse
a
chorus
would
come
gliding
on
clad
in
any
sort
of
costume
which
admitted
of
colour
and
the
display
of
legs
the
painted
women
of
this
chorus
were
never
still
for
an
instant
if
they
were
not
actually
dancing
they
were
wriggling
their
legs
and
jerking
their
bodies
from
side
to
side
and
nodding
their
heads
and
in
all
other
possible
ways
being
lively
but
it
was
not
the
physical
indecency
of
this
show
that
struck
montague
so
much
as
its
intellectual
content
the
dialogue
of
the
piece
was
what
is
called
smart
that
is
it
was
full
of
a
kind
of
innuendo
which
implied
a
secret
understanding
of
evil
between
the
actor
and
his
audience
a
sort
of
countersign
which
passed
between
them
after
all
it
would
have
been
an
error
to
say
that
there
were
no
ideas
in
the
play
there
was
one
idea
upon
which
all
the
interest
of
it
was
based
and
montague
strove
to
analyze
this
idea
and
formulate
it
to
himself
there
are
certain
life
might
call
them
moral
axioms
which
are
the
result
of
the
experience
of
countless
ages
of
the
human
race
and
upon
the
adherence
to
which
the
continuance
of
the
race
depends
and
here
was
an
audience
by
whom
all
these
principles
were
not
questioned
nor
yet
disputed
nor
yet
denied
but
to
whom
the
denial
was
the
axiom
something
which
it
would
be
too
banal
to
state
flatly
but
which
it
was
elegant
and
witty
to
take
for
granted
in
this
audience
there
were
elderly
people
and
married
men
and
women
and
young
men
and
maidens
and
a
perfect
gale
of
laughter
swept
through
it
at
a
story
of
a
married
woman
whose
lover
had
left
her
when
he
got
married
she
must
have
been
heartbroken
said
the
leading
lady
she
was
desperate
said
the
leading
man
with
a
grin
what
did
she
do
asked
the
lady
go
and
shoot
herself
worse
than
that
said
the
man
she
went
back
to
her
husband
and
had
a
baby
but
to
complete
your
understanding
of
the
significance
of
this
play
you
must
bring
yourself
to
realize
that
it
was
not
merely
a
play
but
a
kind
of
a
play
it
had
a
name
a
musical
comedy
the
meaning
of
which
every
one
understood
hundreds
of
such
plays
were
written
and
produced
and
dramatic
critics
went
to
see
them
and
gravely
discussed
them
and
many
thousands
of
people
made
their
livings
by
travelling
over
the
country
and
playing
them
stately
theatres
were
built
for
them
and
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
paid
their
money
every
night
to
see
them
and
all
this
no
joke
and
no
nightmare
but
a
thing
that
really
existed
men
and
women
were
doing
these
things
actual
human
beings
montague
wondered
in
an
awestricken
sort
of
way
what
kind
of
human
being
it
could
be
who
had
flourished
the
cane
and
made
the
grimaces
in
that
play
later
on
when
he
came
to
know
the
tenderloin
he
met
this
same
actor
and
he
found
that
he
had
begun
life
as
a
little
irish
mick
who
lived
in
a
tenement
and
whose
mother
stood
at
the
head
of
the
stairway
and
defended
him
with
a
against
a
policeman
who
was
chasing
him
he
had
discovered
that
he
could
make
a
living
by
his
comical
antics
but
when
he
came
home
and
told
his
mother
that
he
had
been
offered
twenty
dollars
a
week
by
a
show
manager
she
gave
him
a
licking
for
lying
to
her
now
he
was
making
three
thousand
dollars
a
week
more
than
the
president
of
the
united
states
and
his
cabinet
but
he
was
not
happy
as
he
confided
to
montague
because
he
did
not
know
how
to
read
and
this
was
a
cause
of
perpetual
humiliation
the
secret
desire
of
this
little
actor
heart
was
to
play
shakespeare
he
had
hamlet
read
to
him
and
pondered
how
to
act
it
all
the
time
that
he
was
flourishing
his
little
cane
and
making
his
grimaces
he
had
chanced
to
be
on
the
stage
when
a
fire
had
broken
out
and
five
or
six
hundred
victims
of
greed
were
roasted
to
death
the
actor
had
pleaded
with
the
people
to
keep
their
seats
but
all
in
vain
and
all
his
life
thereafter
he
went
about
with
this
vision
of
horror
in
his
mind
and
haunted
by
the
passionate
conviction
that
he
had
failed
because
of
his
lack
of
education
that
if
only
he
had
been
a
man
of
culture
he
would
have
been
able
to
think
of
something
to
say
to
hold
those
people
at
three
in
the
morning
the
performance
came
to
an
end
and
then
there
were
more
refreshments
and
vivie
patton
came
and
sat
by
him
and
they
had
a
nice
comfortable
gossip
when
vivie
once
got
started
at
talking
about
people
her
tongue
ran
on
like
a
windmill
there
was
reggie
mann
meandering
about
and
simpering
at
people
reggie
was
in
his
glory
at
de
graffenried
affairs
reggie
had
arranged
all
did
the
designing
and
the
ordering
and
contracted
for
the
shows
with
the
agents
you
could
bet
that
he
had
got
his
commission
on
them
too
though
sometimes
de
graffenried
got
the
shows
to
come
for
nothing
because
of
the
advertising
her
name
would
bring
commissions
were
reggie
speciality
he
had
begun
life
as
an
auto
agent
montague
did
know
what
that
was
an
auto
agent
was
a
man
who
was
for
ever
begging
his
friends
to
use
a
certain
kind
of
car
so
that
he
might
make
a
living
and
reggie
had
made
about
thirty
thousand
a
year
in
that
way
he
had
come
from
boston
where
his
reputation
had
been
made
by
the
fact
that
early
one
morning
as
they
were
driving
home
from
a
celebration
he
had
dared
a
young
society
matron
to
take
off
her
shoes
and
stockings
and
get
out
and
wade
in
the
public
fountain
and
she
had
done
it
and
he
had
followed
her
on
the
strength
of
the
eclat
of
this
he
had
been
taken
up
by
devon
and
one
day
devon
had
worn
a
white
gown
and
asked
him
what
he
thought
of
it
it
needs
but
one
thing
to
make
it
perfect
said
reggie
and
taking
a
red
rose
he
pinned
it
upon
her
corsage
the
effect
was
magical
every
one
exclaimed
with
delight
and
so
reggie
reputation
as
an
authority
upon
dress
was
made
for
ever
now
he
was
de
graffenried
man
and
they
made
up
their
pranks
together
once
they
had
walked
down
the
street
in
newport
with
a
big
rag
doll
between
them
and
reggie
had
given
a
dinner
at
which
the
guest
of
honour
had
been
a
monkey
surely
montague
had
heard
of
that
for
it
had
been
the
sensation
of
the
season
it
was
really
the
funniest
thing
imaginable
the
monkey
wore
a
suit
of
with
collar
and
cuffs
and
he
shook
hands
with
all
the
guests
and
behaved
himself
exactly
like
a
gentleman
except
that
he
did
not
get
drunk
and
then
vivie
pointed
out
the
great
who
was
sitting
with
one
of
her
favourites
a
grave
gentleman
who
had
leaped
into
fame
by
inheriting
fifty
million
dollars
had
taken
him
up
and
ordered
his
engagement
book
for
him
and
he
was
solemnly
playing
the
part
of
a
social
light
he
had
purchased
an
old
new
york
mansion
upon
the
decoration
of
which
three
million
dollars
had
been
spent
and
when
he
came
down
to
business
from
tuxedo
his
private
train
waited
all
day
for
him
with
steam
up
vivie
told
an
amusing
tale
of
a
woman
who
had
announced
her
engagement
to
him
and
borrowed
large
sums
of
money
upon
the
strength
of
it
before
his
denial
came
out
that
had
been
a
source
of
great
delight
to
de
graffenried
who
was
furiously
jealous
of
from
the
anecdotes
that
people
told
montague
judged
that
de
graffenried
must
be
one
of
those
new
leaders
of
society
who
as
alden
said
were
inclined
to
the
bizarre
and
fantastic
de
graffenried
spent
half
a
million
dollars
every
season
to
hold
the
position
of
leader
of
the
newport
set
and
you
could
always
count
upon
her
for
new
and
striking
ideas
once
she
had
given
away
as
cotillion
favours
tiny
globes
with
goldfish
in
them
again
she
had
given
a
dance
at
which
everybody
got
themselves
up
as
different
vegetables
she
was
fond
of
going
about
at
newport
and
inviting
people
haphazard
to
lunch
thirty
or
forty
at
a
time
and
then
surprising
them
with
a
splendid
banquet
again
she
would
give
a
big
formal
dinner
and
perplex
people
by
offering
them
something
which
they
really
cared
to
eat
you
see
explained
vivie
at
these
dinners
we
generally
get
thick
green
turtle
soup
and
omelettes
with
some
sort
of
florida
water
poured
over
them
and
mushrooms
cooked
under
glass
and
real
desserts
but
de
graffenried
dares
to
have
baked
ham
and
sweet
potatoes
or
even
real
roast
beef
you
saw
that
she
had
green
corn
she
must
have
arranged
for
that
months
ahead
we
can
never
get
it
from
porto
rico
until
january
and
you
see
this
little
dish
of
wild
strawberries
they
were
probably
transplanted
and
raised
in
a
hothouse
and
every
single
one
wrapped
separately
before
they
were
shipped
all
these
labours
had
made
de
graffenried
a
tremendous
power
in
the
social
world
she
had
a
savage
tongue
said
vivie
and
every
one
lived
in
terror
of
her
but
once
in
a
while
she
met
her
match
once
she
had
invited
a
comic
opera
star
to
sing
for
her
guests
and
all
the
men
had
crowded
round
this
actress
and
de
graffenried
had
flown
into
a
passion
and
tried
to
drive
them
away
and
the
actress
lolling
back
in
her
chair
and
gazing
up
idly
at
de
graffenried
had
drawled
ten
years
older
than
god
poor
de
graffenried
would
carry
that
saying
with
her
until
she
died
something
reminiscent
of
this
came
under
montague
notice
that
same
evening
at
about
four
vivie
wished
to
go
home
and
asked
him
to
find
her
escort
the
count
elmo
de
champignon
the
man
by
the
way
for
whom
her
husband
was
gunning
montague
roamed
all
about
the
house
and
finally
went
downstairs
where
a
room
had
been
set
apart
for
the
theatrical
company
to
partake
of
refreshments
de
graffenried
secretary
was
on
guard
at
the
door
but
some
of
the
boys
had
got
into
the
room
and
were
drinking
champagne
and
making
dates
with
the
and
here
was
de
graffenried
herself
pushing
them
bodily
out
of
the
room
a
score
and
more
of
them
and
among
them
vivie
count
montague
delivered
his
message
and
then
went
upstairs
to
wait
until
his
own
party
should
be
ready
to
leave
in
the
were
a
number
of
men
also
waiting
and
among
them
he
noticed
major
venable
in
conversation
with
a
man
whom
he
did
not
know
come
over
here
the
major
called
and
montague
obeyed
at
the
same
time
noticing
the
stranger
he
was
a
tall
powerfully
built
man
a
small
head
and
a
very
striking
face
a
grim
mouth
with
drooping
corners
tightly
set
and
a
nose
and
peering
eyes
have
you
met
mr
hegan
said
the
major
hegan
this
is
allan
montague
jim
hegan
montague
repressed
a
stare
and
took
the
chair
which
they
offered
him
have
a
cigar
said
hegan
holding
out
his
case
montague
has
just
come
to
new
york
said
the
major
he
is
a
southerner
too
indeed
said
hegan
and
inquired
what
state
he
came
from
montague
replied
and
added
i
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
your
daughter
last
week
at
the
horse
show
that
served
to
start
a
conversation
for
hegan
came
from
texas
and
when
he
found
that
montague
knew
about
horses
real
horses
he
warmed
to
him
then
the
major
party
called
him
away
and
the
other
two
were
left
to
carry
on
the
conversation
it
was
very
easy
to
chat
with
hegan
and
yet
underneath
in
the
mind
there
lurked
a
vague
feeling
of
trepidation
as
he
realized
that
he
was
chatting
with
a
hundred
millions
of
dollars
montague
was
new
enough
at
the
game
to
imagine
that
there
ought
to
be
something
strange
some
atmosphere
of
awe
and
mystery
about
a
man
who
was
master
of
a
dozen
railroads
and
of
the
politics
of
half
a
dozen
states
he
was
simple
and
very
kindly
in
his
manner
a
plain
man
interested
in
plain
things
there
was
about
him
as
he
talked
a
trace
of
timidity
almost
of
apology
which
montague
noticed
and
wondered
at
it
was
only
later
when
he
had
time
to
think
about
it
that
he
realized
that
hegan
had
begun
as
a
farmer
boy
in
texas
a
poor
white
and
could
it
be
that
after
all
these
years
an
instinct
remained
in
him
so
that
whenever
he
met
a
gentleman
of
the
old
south
he
stood
by
with
a
little
deference
seeming
to
beg
pardon
for
his
hundred
millions
of
dollars
and
yet
there
was
the
power
of
the
man
even
chatting
about
horses
you
felt
it
you
felt
that
there
was
a
part
of
him
which
did
not
chat
but
which
sat
behind
and
watched
and
strangest
of
all
montague
found
himself
fancying
that
behind
the
face
that
smiled
was
another
face
that
did
not
smile
but
that
was
grim
and
set
it
was
a
strange
face
with
its
broad
sweeping
eyebrows
and
its
drooping
mouth
it
haunted
montague
and
made
him
feel
ill
at
ease
there
came
laura
hegan
who
greeted
them
in
her
stately
way
and
hegan
bustling
and
vivacious
costumed
en
grande
dame
come
and
see
me
some
time
said
the
man
you
wo
be
apt
to
meet
me
otherwise
for
i
do
go
about
much
and
so
they
took
their
departure
and
montague
sat
alone
and
smoked
and
thought
the
face
still
stayed
with
him
and
now
suddenly
in
a
burst
of
light
it
came
to
him
what
it
was
the
face
of
a
bird
of
prey
of
the
great
wild
lonely
eagle
you
have
seen
it
perhaps
in
a
menagerie
sitting
high
up
submitting
patiently
biding
its
time
but
all
the
while
the
soul
of
the
eagle
is
far
away
ranging
the
wide
spaces
ready
for
the
lightning
swoop
and
the
clutch
with
the
cruel
talons
chapter
x
the
next
week
was
a
busy
one
for
the
montagues
the
robbie
wallings
had
come
to
town
and
opened
their
house
and
the
time
drew
near
for
the
wonderful
débutante
dance
at
which
alice
was
to
be
formally
presented
to
society
and
of
course
alice
must
have
a
new
dress
for
the
occasion
and
it
must
be
absolutely
the
most
beautiful
dress
ever
known
in
an
idle
moment
her
cousin
figured
out
that
it
was
to
cost
her
about
five
dollars
a
minute
to
be
entertained
by
the
wallings
what
it
would
cost
the
wallings
one
scarcely
dared
to
think
their
ballroom
would
be
turned
into
a
and
there
would
be
a
supper
for
a
hundred
guests
and
still
another
supper
after
the
dance
and
costly
favours
for
every
figure
the
purchasing
of
these
latter
had
been
entrusted
to
oliver
and
montague
heard
with
dismay
what
they
were
to
cost
robbie
could
afford
to
do
anything
was
the
younger
brother
only
reply
to
his
exclamations
alice
divided
her
time
between
the
wallings
and
her
costumiers
and
every
evening
she
came
home
with
a
new
tale
of
important
developments
alice
was
new
at
the
game
and
could
afford
to
be
excited
and
robbie
liked
to
see
her
bright
face
and
to
smile
indulgently
at
her
eager
inquiries
robbie
herself
had
given
her
orders
to
her
steward
and
her
florist
and
her
secretary
and
went
on
her
way
and
thought
no
more
about
it
that
was
the
way
of
the
great
ladies
or
at
any
rate
it
was
their
pose
the
of
the
robbies
was
a
stately
palace
occupying
a
block
upon
fifth
avenue
one
of
the
mansions
of
the
walling
family
which
were
among
the
show
places
of
the
city
it
would
take
a
catalogue
to
list
the
establishments
maintained
by
the
wallings
there
was
an
estate
in
north
carolina
and
another
in
the
adirondacks
and
others
on
long
island
and
in
new
jersey
also
there
were
several
in
newport
one
which
was
almost
never
occupied
and
which
billy
alden
sarcastically
described
as
a
castle
on
a
desert
montague
accompanied
alice
once
or
twice
and
had
an
opportunity
to
study
robbie
at
home
there
were
servants
in
her
establishment
it
was
a
little
state
all
in
itself
with
robbie
as
queen
and
her
housekeeper
as
prime
minister
and
under
them
as
many
different
ranks
and
classes
and
castes
as
in
a
feudal
principality
there
had
to
be
six
separate
for
the
various
kinds
of
servants
who
scorned
each
other
there
were
servants
servants
and
servants
of
servants
servants
there
were
only
three
to
whom
the
mistress
was
supposed
to
give
orders
the
butler
the
steward
and
the
housekeeper
she
did
not
even
know
the
names
of
many
of
them
and
they
were
changed
so
often
that
as
she
declared
she
had
to
leave
it
to
her
detective
to
distinguish
between
employees
and
burglars
robbie
was
quite
a
young
woman
but
it
pleased
her
to
pose
as
a
matron
weary
of
the
responsibilities
of
her
exalted
station
the
ignorant
looked
on
and
pictured
her
as
living
in
the
lap
of
ease
endowed
with
every
opportunity
in
reality
the
meanest
was
freer
she
was
quite
worn
thin
with
the
burdens
that
fell
upon
her
the
huge
machine
was
for
ever
threatening
to
fall
to
pieces
and
required
the
wisdom
of
solomon
and
the
patience
of
job
to
keep
it
running
one
paid
one
steward
a
fortune
and
yet
he
robbed
right
and
left
and
quarrelled
with
the
chef
besides
the
butler
was
suspected
of
getting
drunk
upon
rare
and
costly
vintages
and
the
new
had
turned
out
to
be
a
sunday
reporter
in
disguise
the
man
who
had
come
every
day
for
ten
years
to
wind
the
clocks
of
the
establishment
was
dead
and
the
one
who
took
care
of
the
was
sick
and
the
housekeeper
was
in
a
panic
over
the
prospect
of
having
to
train
another
and
even
suppose
that
you
escaped
from
these
things
the
real
problems
of
your
life
had
still
to
be
faced
it
was
not
enough
to
keep
alive
you
had
your
career
your
duties
as
a
leader
of
society
there
was
the
daily
mail
with
all
the
pitiful
letters
from
people
begging
money
actually
in
one
single
week
there
were
demands
for
two
million
dollars
there
were
geniuses
with
patent
incubators
and
and
every
time
you
gave
a
ball
you
stirred
up
swarms
of
anarchists
and
cranks
and
then
there
were
the
letters
you
really
had
to
answer
and
the
calls
that
had
to
be
paid
these
latter
were
so
many
that
people
in
the
same
neighbourhood
had
arranged
to
have
the
same
day
at
home
thus
if
you
lived
on
madison
avenue
you
had
thursday
but
even
then
it
took
a
whole
afternoon
to
leave
your
cards
and
then
there
were
invitations
to
be
sent
and
accepted
and
one
was
always
making
mistakes
and
offending
somebody
people
would
become
mortal
enemies
overnight
and
expect
all
the
world
to
know
it
the
next
morning
and
now
there
were
so
many
divorces
and
remarryings
with
consequent
changing
of
names
and
some
men
knew
about
their
wives
lovers
and
did
care
and
some
did
care
but
did
know
altogether
it
was
like
carrying
a
dozen
chess
games
in
your
head
and
then
there
was
the
hairdresser
and
the
manicurist
and
the
masseuse
and
the
tailor
and
the
bootmaker
and
the
jeweller
and
then
one
absolutely
had
to
glance
through
a
newspaper
and
to
see
one
children
now
and
then
all
this
robbie
explained
at
luncheon
it
was
the
rich
burden
about
which
common
people
had
no
conception
whatever
a
person
with
a
lot
of
money
was
like
a
barrel
of
molasses
all
the
flies
in
the
neighbourhood
came
buzzing
about
it
was
perfectly
incredible
the
lengths
to
which
people
would
go
to
get
invited
to
your
house
not
only
would
they
write
and
beg
you
they
might
attack
your
business
interests
and
even
bribe
your
friends
and
on
the
other
hand
when
people
thought
you
needed
them
the
time
you
had
to
get
them
to
come
fancy
said
robbie
offering
to
give
a
dinner
to
an
english
countess
and
having
her
try
to
charge
you
for
coming
and
incredible
as
it
might
seem
some
people
had
actually
yielded
to
her
and
the
disgusting
creature
had
played
the
social
celebrity
for
a
whole
season
and
made
quite
a
handsome
income
out
of
it
there
seemed
to
be
no
limit
to
the
abjectness
of
some
of
the
in
society
it
was
instructive
to
hear
robbie
denounce
such
evils
and
yet
alas
for
human
frailty
the
next
time
that
montague
called
the
great
lady
was
blazing
with
wrath
over
the
tidings
that
a
new
foreign
prince
was
coming
to
america
and
that
had
stolen
a
march
upon
her
and
grabbed
him
he
was
to
be
under
her
tutelage
the
entire
time
and
all
the
effulgence
of
his
magnificence
would
be
radiated
upon
that
upstart
house
robbie
revenged
herself
by
saying
as
many
disagreeable
things
about
as
she
could
think
of
winding
up
with
the
declaration
that
if
she
behaved
with
this
prince
as
she
had
with
the
russian
grand
duke
robbie
walling
for
one
would
cut
her
dead
and
truly
the
details
which
robbie
cited
were
calculated
to
suggest
that
her
rival
hospitality
was
a
reversion
to
the
customs
of
primitive
savagery
the
above
is
a
fair
sample
of
the
kind
of
conversation
that
one
heard
whenever
one
visited
any
of
the
wallings
perhaps
as
robbie
said
it
may
have
been
their
millions
that
made
necessary
their
attitude
toward
other
people
certain
it
was
at
any
rate
that
montague
found
them
all
most
disagreeable
people
to
know
there
was
always
some
tempest
in
a
teapot
over
the
latest
machinations
of
their
enemies
and
then
there
was
the
whole
dead
mass
of
people
who
sponged
upon
them
and
toadied
to
them
and
finally
the
barbarian
hordes
outside
the
magic
circle
of
their
acquaintance
some
specimens
of
whom
came
up
every
day
for
ridicule
they
had
big
feet
and
false
teeth
they
ate
mush
and
molasses
they
wore
ties
they
said
do
you
wish
that
i
should
do
it
their
grandfathers
had
been
butchers
and
pedlars
and
other
abhorrent
things
montague
tried
his
best
to
like
the
wallings
because
of
what
they
were
doing
for
alice
but
after
he
had
sat
at
their
and
listened
to
a
conversation
such
as
this
he
found
himself
in
need
of
fresh
air
and
then
he
would
begin
to
wonder
about
his
own
relation
to
these
people
if
they
talked
about
every
one
else
behind
their
backs
certainly
they
must
talk
about
him
behind
his
and
why
did
they
go
out
of
their
way
to
make
him
at
home
and
why
were
they
spending
their
money
to
launch
alice
in
society
in
the
beginning
he
had
assumed
that
they
did
it
out
of
the
goodness
of
their
hearts
but
now
that
he
had
looked
into
their
hearts
he
rejected
the
explanation
it
was
not
their
way
to
shower
princely
gifts
upon
strangers
in
general
the
attitude
of
all
the
wallings
toward
a
stranger
was
that
of
the
london
hooligan
a
a
brick
at
they
considered
themselves
especially
appointed
by
providence
to
protect
society
from
the
vulgar
newly
rich
who
poured
into
the
city
seeking
for
notoriety
and
recognition
they
prided
themselves
upon
this
attitude
they
called
it
their
exclusiveness
and
the
exclusiveness
of
the
younger
generations
of
wallings
had
become
a
kind
of
insanity
nor
could
the
reason
be
that
alice
was
beautiful
and
attractive
one
could
have
imagined
it
if
robbie
had
been
like
say
winnie
duval
it
was
easy
to
think
of
winnie
taking
a
fancy
to
a
girl
and
spending
half
her
fortune
upon
her
but
from
a
hundred
little
things
that
he
had
seen
montague
had
come
to
realize
that
the
robbie
wallings
with
all
their
wealth
and
power
and
grandeur
were
actually
quite
stingy
while
all
the
world
saw
them
scattering
fortunes
in
their
pathway
in
reality
they
were
keeping
track
of
every
dollar
and
robbie
himself
was
liable
to
panic
fits
of
economy
in
which
he
went
to
the
most
absurd
excesses
montague
once
heard
him
haggling
over
fifty
cents
with
a
cabman
lavish
hosts
though
they
both
were
it
was
the
literal
truth
that
they
never
spent
money
upon
anyone
but
themselves
the
end
and
aim
of
their
every
action
was
the
power
and
prestige
of
the
robbie
wallings
they
do
it
because
they
are
friends
of
mine
said
oliver
and
evidently
wished
that
to
satisfy
his
brother
but
it
only
shifted
the
problem
and
set
him
to
watching
robbie
and
oliver
and
trying
to
make
out
the
basis
of
their
relationship
there
was
a
very
grave
question
concerned
in
this
oliver
had
come
to
new
york
comparatively
poor
and
now
he
was
rich
or
at
any
rate
he
lived
like
a
rich
man
and
his
brother
whose
scent
was
growing
keener
with
every
day
of
his
stay
in
new
york
had
about
made
up
his
mind
that
oliver
got
his
money
from
robbie
walling
here
again
the
problem
would
have
been
simple
if
it
had
been
another
person
than
robbie
montague
would
have
concluded
that
his
brother
was
a
there
were
many
great
families
whose
establishments
were
infested
with
such
parasites
siegfried
harvey
for
instance
was
a
man
who
had
always
half
a
dozen
young
chaps
hanging
about
him
and
lively
fellows
who
hunted
and
played
bridge
and
amused
the
married
women
while
their
husbands
were
at
work
and
who
if
ever
they
dropped
a
hint
that
they
were
hard
up
might
be
reasonably
certain
of
being
offered
a
cheque
but
if
the
robbie
wallings
were
to
write
cheques
it
must
be
for
value
received
and
what
could
the
value
be
ollie
was
rather
a
little
god
among
the
his
taste
was
a
kind
of
inspiration
and
yet
his
brother
noticed
that
in
such
questions
he
always
deferred
instantly
to
the
wallings
and
surely
the
wallings
were
not
people
to
be
persuaded
that
they
needed
anyone
to
guide
them
in
matters
of
taste
again
ollie
was
the
very
devil
of
a
wit
and
people
were
heartily
afraid
of
him
and
montague
had
noticed
that
he
never
by
any
chance
made
fun
of
robbie
that
the
fetiches
of
the
house
of
walling
were
always
treated
with
respect
so
he
had
wondered
if
by
any
chance
robbie
was
maintaining
his
brother
in
princely
state
for
the
sake
of
his
ability
to
make
other
people
uncomfortable
but
he
realized
that
the
robbies
in
their
own
view
of
it
could
have
no
more
need
of
wit
than
a
battleship
has
need
of
popguns
oliver
position
when
they
were
about
was
rather
that
of
the
man
who
hardly
ever
dared
to
be
as
clever
as
he
might
because
of
the
restless
jealousy
of
his
friend
it
was
a
mystery
and
it
made
the
elder
brother
very
uncomfortable
alice
was
young
and
guileless
and
a
pleasant
person
to
patronize
but
he
was
a
man
of
the
world
and
it
was
his
business
to
protect
her
he
had
always
paid
his
own
way
through
life
and
he
was
very
loath
to
put
himself
under
obligations
to
people
like
the
wallings
whom
he
did
not
like
and
who
he
felt
instinctively
could
not
like
him
but
of
course
there
was
nothing
he
could
do
about
it
the
date
for
the
great
festivity
was
set
and
the
wallings
were
affable
and
friendly
and
alice
all
with
excitement
the
evening
arrived
and
with
it
came
the
enemies
of
the
wallings
dressed
in
their
jewels
and
fine
raiment
they
had
been
asked
because
they
were
too
important
to
be
skipped
and
they
had
come
because
the
wallings
were
too
powerful
to
be
ignored
they
revenged
themselves
by
consuming
many
courses
of
elaborate
and
costly
viands
and
they
shook
hands
with
alice
and
beamed
upon
her
and
then
discussed
her
behind
her
back
as
if
she
were
a
french
doll
in
a
they
decided
unanimously
that
her
elder
cousin
was
a
stick
and
that
the
whole
family
were
interlopers
and
shameless
adventurers
but
it
was
understood
that
since
the
robbie
wallings
had
seen
fit
to
take
them
up
it
would
be
necessary
to
invite
them
about
at
any
rate
that
was
the
way
it
all
seemed
to
montague
who
had
been
brooding
to
alice
it
was
a
splendid
festivity
to
which
exquisite
people
came
to
take
delight
in
each
other
society
there
were
gorgeous
costumes
and
sparkling
gems
there
was
a
symphony
of
perfumes
intoxicating
the
senses
and
a
golden
flood
of
music
streaming
by
there
were
laughing
voices
and
admiring
glances
and
handsome
partners
with
whom
one
might
dance
through
the
portals
of
and
then
next
morning
there
were
accounts
in
all
the
newspapers
with
descriptions
of
one
costume
and
then
some
of
those
present
and
even
the
complete
menus
of
the
supper
to
assist
in
preserving
the
memories
of
the
wonderful
occasion
now
they
were
really
in
society
a
reporter
called
to
get
alice
photo
for
the
sunday
supplement
and
floods
of
invitations
came
and
with
them
all
the
cares
and
perplexities
about
which
robbie
had
told
some
of
these
invitations
had
to
be
declined
and
one
must
know
whom
it
was
safe
to
offend
also
there
was
a
long
letter
from
a
destitute
widow
and
a
proposal
from
a
foreign
count
robbie
secretary
had
a
list
of
many
hundreds
of
these
professional
beggars
and
blackmailers
conspicuous
at
the
dance
was
winnie
in
a
glorious
silk
gown
and
she
shook
her
fan
at
montague
exclaiming
you
wretched
man
you
promised
to
come
and
see
me
i
been
out
of
town
montague
protested
well
come
to
dinner
night
said
winnie
there
be
some
bridge
fiends
you
forget
i
have
learned
to
play
he
objected
well
come
anyhow
she
replied
we
teach
you
i
no
player
myself
and
my
husband
will
be
there
and
he
and
my
brother
dan
he
have
to
be
whether
he
likes
it
or
not
so
montague
visited
the
snow
palace
again
and
met
winton
duval
the
banker
a
tall
man
of
about
fifty
with
a
big
grey
moustache
and
bushy
eyebrows
and
the
head
of
a
lion
his
was
one
of
the
city
biggest
and
in
alliance
with
powerful
interests
in
the
street
at
present
he
was
going
in
for
mines
in
mexico
and
south
america
and
so
he
was
very
seldom
at
home
he
was
a
man
of
most
rigid
habits
he
would
come
back
unexpectedly
after
a
trip
and
expect
to
find
everything
ready
for
him
both
at
home
and
in
his
office
as
if
he
had
just
stepped
round
the
corner
montague
observed
that
he
took
his
and
jotted
down
his
comments
upon
each
dish
and
then
sent
it
down
to
the
chef
other
people
dinners
he
very
seldom
attended
and
when
his
wife
gave
her
entertainments
he
invariably
dined
at
the
club
he
pleaded
a
business
engagement
for
the
evening
and
as
brother
dan
did
not
appear
montague
did
not
learn
any
bridge
the
other
four
guests
settled
down
to
the
game
and
montague
and
winnie
sat
and
chatted
basking
before
the
fireplace
in
the
great
have
you
seen
charlie
carter
was
the
first
question
she
asked
him
not
lately
he
answered
i
met
him
at
harvey
i
know
that
said
she
they
tell
me
he
got
drunk
i
afraid
he
did
said
montague
poor
boy
exclaimed
winnie
and
alice
saw
him
he
must
be
heartbroken
montague
said
nothing
you
know
she
went
on
charlie
really
means
well
he
has
honestly
an
affectionate
nature
she
paused
and
montague
said
vaguely
i
suppose
so
you
do
like
him
said
the
other
i
can
see
that
and
i
suppose
now
alice
will
have
no
use
for
him
either
and
i
had
it
all
fixed
up
for
her
to
reform
him
montague
smiled
in
spite
of
himself
oh
i
know
said
she
it
would
have
been
easy
but
you
no
idea
what
a
beautiful
boy
charlie
used
to
be
until
all
the
women
set
to
work
to
ruin
him
i
can
imagine
it
said
montague
but
he
did
not
warm
to
the
subject
you
just
like
my
husband
said
winnie
sadly
you
have
no
use
at
all
for
anything
that
weak
or
unfortunate
there
was
a
pause
and
i
suppose
she
said
finally
you
be
turning
into
a
business
man
also
with
no
time
for
anybody
or
anything
have
you
begun
yet
not
yet
he
answered
i
still
looking
round
i
have
the
least
idea
about
business
she
confessed
how
does
one
begin
at
it
i
ca
say
i
know
that
myself
as
yet
said
montague
laughing
would
you
like
to
be
a
protege
of
my
husband
she
asked
the
proposition
was
rather
sudden
but
he
answered
with
a
smile
i
should
have
no
objections
what
would
he
do
with
me
i
do
know
that
but
he
can
do
whatever
he
wants
down
town
and
show
you
how
to
make
a
lot
of
money
if
i
asked
him
to
then
winnie
added
quickly
i
mean
it
he
could
do
it
really
i
have
the
least
doubt
of
it
responded
montague
and
what
more
she
went
on
you
do
want
to
be
shy
about
taking
advantage
of
the
opportunities
that
come
to
you
you
find
you
get
along
in
new
york
unless
you
go
right
in
and
grab
what
you
can
people
will
be
quick
enough
to
take
advantage
of
you
they
have
all
been
very
kind
to
me
so
far
said
he
but
when
i
get
ready
for
business
i
harden
my
heart
winnie
sat
lost
in
meditation
i
think
business
is
dreadful
she
said
so
much
hard
work
and
worry
why
ca
men
learn
to
get
along
without
it
there
are
bills
that
have
to
be
paid
montague
replied
it
our
dreadfully
extravagant
way
of
life
exclaimed
the
other
sometimes
i
wish
i
had
never
had
any
money
in
my
life
you
would
soon
tire
of
it
said
he
you
would
miss
this
house
i
should
not
miss
it
a
bit
said
winnie
promptly
that
is
really
the
truth
i
do
care
for
this
sort
of
thing
at
all
i
like
to
live
simply
and
without
so
many
cares
and
responsibilities
and
some
day
i
going
to
do
it
too
i
really
am
i
going
to
get
myself
a
little
farm
away
off
somewhere
in
the
country
and
i
going
there
to
live
and
raise
chickens
and
vegetables
and
have
my
own
that
i
can
take
care
of
myself
it
will
all
be
plain
and
simple
and
then
winnie
stopped
short
exclaiming
you
are
laughing
at
me
not
at
all
said
montague
but
i
could
help
thinking
about
the
newspaper
reporters
there
you
are
said
she
one
can
never
have
a
beautiful
dream
or
try
to
do
anything
sensible
because
of
the
newspaper
reporters
if
montague
had
been
meeting
winnie
duval
for
the
first
time
he
would
have
been
impressed
by
her
yearnings
for
the
simple
life
he
would
have
thought
it
an
important
sign
of
the
times
but
alas
he
knew
by
this
time
that
his
charming
hostess
had
more
flummery
about
her
than
anybody
else
he
had
encountered
and
all
of
her
own
devising
winnie
smoked
her
own
private
brand
of
cigarettes
and
when
she
offered
them
to
you
there
were
the
arms
of
the
old
ducal
house
of
montmorenci
on
the
wrappers
and
when
you
got
a
letter
from
winnie
you
observed
a
stamp
upon
the
envelope
for
lavender
was
her
colour
and
stamps
were
an
atrocious
red
so
one
might
feel
certain
that
it
winnie
ever
went
in
for
the
chickens
would
be
especially
imported
from
china
or
patagonia
and
the
would
be
precise
replicas
of
those
in
the
old
chateau
de
montmorenci
which
she
had
visited
in
her
automobile
but
winnie
was
beautiful
and
quite
entertaining
to
talk
to
and
so
he
was
respectfully
sympathetic
while
she
told
him
about
her
pastoral
intentions
and
then
she
told
him
about
caroline
smythe
who
had
called
a
meeting
of
her
friends
at
one
of
the
big
hotels
and
organized
a
society
and
founded
the
home
for
destitute
cats
after
that
she
switched
off
into
psychic
research
somebody
had
taken
her
to
a
seance
where
grave
college
professors
and
ladies
in
spectacles
sat
round
and
waited
for
ghosts
to
materialize
it
was
winnie
first
experience
at
this
and
she
was
as
excited
as
a
child
who
has
just
found
the
key
to
the
i
hardly
knew
whether
to
laugh
or
to
be
afraid
she
said
what
would
you
think
you
may
have
the
pleasure
of
giving
me
my
first
impressions
of
it
said
montague
with
a
laugh
well
said
she
they
had
and
it
was
the
most
uncanny
thing
to
see
the
table
go
jumping
about
the
room
and
then
there
were
raps
and
one
ca
imagine
how
strange
it
was
to
see
people
who
really
believed
they
were
getting
messages
from
ghosts
it
positively
made
my
flesh
creep
and
then
this
woman
madame
went
into
a
trance
ugh
afterward
i
talked
with
one
of
the
men
and
he
told
me
about
how
his
father
had
appeared
to
him
in
the
night
and
told
him
he
had
just
been
drowned
at
sea
have
you
ever
heard
of
such
a
thing
we
have
such
a
tradition
in
our
family
said
he
every
family
seems
to
have
said
winnie
but
dear
me
it
made
me
so
uncomfortable
i
lay
awake
all
night
expecting
to
see
my
own
father
he
had
the
asthma
you
know
and
i
kept
fancying
i
heard
him
breathing
they
had
risen
and
were
strolling
into
the
conservatory
and
she
glanced
at
the
man
in
armour
i
got
to
fancying
that
his
ghost
might
come
to
see
me
she
said
i
do
think
i
shall
attend
any
more
seances
my
husband
was
told
that
i
promised
them
some
money
and
he
was
furious
he
afraid
it
get
into
the
papers
and
montague
shook
with
inward
laughter
picturing
what
a
time
the
aristocratic
and
stately
old
banker
must
have
trying
to
keep
his
wife
out
of
the
papers
winnie
turned
on
the
lights
in
the
fountain
and
sat
by
the
edge
gazing
at
her
fish
montague
was
half
expecting
her
to
inquire
whether
he
thought
that
they
had
ghosts
but
she
spared
him
this
going
off
on
another
line
i
asked
parry
about
it
she
said
have
you
met
him
parry
was
the
rector
of
cecilia
the
fashionable
fifth
avenue
church
which
most
of
montague
acquaintances
attended
i
have
been
in
the
city
over
sunday
yet
he
answered
but
alice
has
met
him
you
must
go
with
me
some
time
said
she
but
about
the
ghosts
what
did
he
say
he
seemed
to
be
shy
of
them
laughed
winnie
he
said
it
had
a
tendency
to
lead
one
into
dangerous
fields
but
oh
i
forgot
i
asked
my
swami
also
and
it
did
startle
him
they
are
used
to
ghosts
they
believe
that
souls
keep
coming
back
to
earth
you
know
i
think
if
it
was
his
ghost
i
would
mind
seeing
it
for
he
has
such
beautiful
eyes
he
gave
me
a
book
of
hindu
legends
and
there
was
such
a
sweet
story
about
a
young
princess
who
loved
in
vain
and
died
of
grief
and
her
soul
went
into
a
tigress
and
she
came
in
the
where
her
lover
lay
sleeping
by
the
firelight
and
she
carried
him
off
into
the
it
was
a
most
creepy
thing
i
sat
out
here
and
read
it
and
i
could
imagine
the
terrible
tigress
lurking
in
the
shadows
with
its
stripes
shining
in
the
firelight
and
its
green
eyes
gleaming
you
know
that
poem
we
used
to
read
it
in
school
tiger
burning
bright
it
was
not
very
easy
for
montague
to
imagine
a
tigress
in
conservatory
unless
indeed
one
were
willing
to
take
the
proposition
in
a
metaphorical
sense
there
are
wild
creatures
which
sleep
in
the
heart
of
man
and
which
growl
now
and
then
and
stir
their
tawny
limbs
and
cause
one
to
start
and
turn
cold
winnie
wore
a
dress
of
filmy
softness
trimmed
with
red
flowers
which
paled
beside
her
own
intenser
colouring
she
had
a
perfume
of
her
own
with
a
strange
exotic
fragrance
which
touched
the
chorus
of
memory
as
only
an
odour
can
she
leaned
towards
him
speaking
eagerly
with
her
soft
white
arms
lying
upon
the
basin
rim
so
much
loveliness
could
not
be
gazed
at
without
pain
and
a
faint
trembling
passed
through
montague
like
a
breeze
across
a
pool
perhaps
it
touched
winnie
also
for
she
fell
suddenly
silent
and
her
gaze
wandered
off
into
the
darkness
for
a
minute
or
two
there
was
stillness
save
for
the
pulse
of
the
fountain
and
the
heaving
of
her
bosom
keeping
time
with
it
and
then
in
the
morning
oliver
inquired
where
were
you
last
night
and
when
his
brother
answered
at
winnie
he
smiled
and
said
oh
then
he
added
gravely
cultivate
winnie
you
ca
do
better
at
present
chapter
xi
montague
accepted
his
friend
invitation
to
share
her
pew
at
cecilia
and
next
sunday
morning
he
and
alice
went
and
found
winnie
with
her
cousin
poor
charlie
had
evidently
been
scrubbed
and
shined
both
physically
and
morally
and
got
ready
to
appeal
for
one
more
chance
while
he
shook
hands
with
alice
he
was
gazing
at
her
with
dumb
and
pleading
eyes
he
seemed
to
be
profoundly
grateful
that
she
did
not
refuse
to
enter
the
pew
with
him
a
most
interesting
place
was
cecilia
was
another
of
the
customs
of
men
and
women
which
society
had
taken
up
like
the
opera
and
made
into
a
state
function
here
was
a
magnificent
temple
with
carved
marble
and
rare
woods
and
jewels
gleaming
decorously
in
a
dim
religious
light
at
the
door
of
this
edifice
would
halt
the
carriages
of
society
and
its
wives
and
daughters
would
alight
rustling
with
new
silk
petticoats
and
starched
and
perfumed
linen
each
one
a
picture
exquisitely
gowned
and
bonneted
and
gloved
and
carrying
a
demure
little
behind
them
followed
the
patient
men
all
in
new
and
shiny
silk
hats
the
men
of
society
were
always
newly
washed
and
shaved
newly
groomed
and
gloved
but
now
they
seemed
to
be
more
so
they
were
full
of
the
atmosphere
of
sunday
alas
for
those
unregenerate
ones
the
infidels
and
the
heathen
who
scoff
in
outer
darkness
and
know
not
the
delicious
feeling
of
sunday
the
joy
of
being
washed
and
starched
and
perfumed
and
made
to
be
clean
and
comfortable
and
good
after
all
the
really
dreadful
wickedness
of
six
days
of
fashionable
life
and
afterward
the
parade
upon
the
avenue
with
the
congregations
of
several
score
additional
churches
and
such
a
show
of
stylish
costumes
that
half
the
city
came
to
see
amid
this
exquisite
assemblage
at
cecilia
the
revolutionary
doctrines
of
the
christian
religion
produced
neither
perplexity
nor
alarm
the
chance
investigator
might
have
listened
in
dismay
to
solemn
pronouncements
of
everlasting
damnation
to
statements
about
rich
men
and
the
eyes
of
needles
and
the
lilies
of
the
field
which
did
not
spin
but
the
congregation
of
cecilia
understood
that
these
things
were
to
be
taken
in
a
quixotic
sense
sharing
the
view
of
the
french
marquis
that
the
almighty
would
think
twice
before
damning
a
gentleman
like
him
one
had
heard
these
phrases
ever
since
childhood
and
one
accepted
them
as
a
matter
of
course
after
all
these
doctrines
had
come
from
the
lips
of
a
divine
being
whom
it
would
be
presumptuous
in
a
mere
mortal
to
attempt
to
imitate
such
points
one
could
but
leave
to
those
whose
business
it
was
to
interpret
them
the
doctors
and
dignitaries
of
the
church
and
when
one
met
them
one
heart
was
set
at
rest
for
they
were
not
iconoclasts
and
alarmists
but
gentlemen
of
culture
and
tact
the
bishop
who
presided
in
this
metropolitan
district
was
a
stately
personage
who
moved
in
the
best
society
and
belonged
to
the
most
exclusive
clubs
the
pews
in
cecilia
were
rented
and
they
were
always
in
great
demand
it
was
one
of
the
customs
of
those
who
hung
upon
the
fringe
of
society
to
come
every
sunday
and
bow
and
smile
and
hope
against
hope
for
some
chance
opening
the
stranger
who
came
was
dependent
upon
hospitality
but
there
were
and
tactful
ushers
who
would
find
one
a
seat
if
one
were
a
presentable
person
the
contingency
of
an
unpresentable
person
seldom
arose
for
the
proletariat
did
not
swarm
at
the
gates
of
cecilia
out
of
its
liberal
income
the
church
maintained
a
mission
upon
the
east
side
where
young
curates
wrestled
with
the
natural
depravity
of
the
lower
classes
meantime
cultivating
a
tone
and
waiting
until
they
should
be
promoted
to
a
real
church
society
was
becoming
deferential
to
its
religious
guides
and
would
have
been
quite
shocked
at
the
idea
that
it
exerted
any
pressure
upon
them
but
the
young
curates
were
painfully
aware
of
a
process
of
unnatural
selection
whereby
those
whose
manner
and
cut
of
coat
were
not
pleasing
were
left
a
long
time
in
the
on
one
occasion
there
had
been
an
amusing
blunder
a
beautiful
new
church
was
built
at
newport
and
an
eloquent
young
minister
was
installed
and
all
society
attended
the
opening
service
and
sat
and
listened
in
consternation
to
an
arraignment
of
its
own
follies
and
vices
the
next
sunday
needless
to
say
society
was
not
present
and
within
half
a
year
the
church
was
stranded
and
had
to
be
dismantled
and
sold
they
had
elaborate
music
at
cecilia
so
beautiful
that
alice
felt
uncomfortable
and
thought
that
it
was
perilously
high
at
this
winnie
laughed
offering
to
take
her
to
an
afternoon
service
around
the
corner
where
they
had
a
full
orchestra
and
a
harp
and
opera
music
and
incense
and
genuflexions
and
confessionals
there
were
people
it
seemed
who
like
to
thrill
themselves
by
dallying
with
the
wickedness
of
romanism
somewhat
as
a
small
boy
tries
to
see
how
near
he
can
walk
to
the
edge
of
a
cliff
the
father
at
this
church
had
a
jewelled
robe
with
a
train
so
many
yards
long
and
which
had
cost
some
incredible
number
of
thousands
of
dollars
and
every
now
and
then
he
marched
in
a
stately
procession
through
the
aisles
so
that
all
the
spectators
might
have
a
good
look
at
it
there
was
a
fierce
controversy
about
these
things
in
the
church
and
libraries
of
pamphlets
were
written
and
intrigues
and
social
wars
were
fought
over
them
but
montague
and
alice
did
not
attend
this
service
they
had
promised
themselves
the
very
plebeian
diversion
of
a
ride
in
the
subway
for
so
far
they
had
not
seen
this
feature
of
the
city
people
who
lived
in
society
saw
madison
and
fifth
avenues
where
their
homes
were
with
the
churches
and
hotels
scattered
along
them
and
the
shopping
district
just
below
and
the
theatre
district
at
one
side
and
the
park
to
the
north
unless
one
went
automobiling
that
was
all
of
the
city
one
need
ever
see
when
visitors
asked
about
the
aquarium
and
the
stock
exchange
and
the
museum
of
art
and
tammany
hall
and
ellis
island
where
the
immigrants
came
the
old
new
yorkers
would
look
perplexed
and
say
dear
me
do
you
really
want
to
see
those
tilings
why
i
have
been
here
all
my
life
and
have
never
seen
them
for
the
hordes
of
sightseers
there
had
been
provided
a
special
contrivance
a
huge
automobile
omnibus
which
seated
thirty
or
forty
people
and
went
from
the
battery
to
harlem
with
a
young
man
shouting
through
a
megaphone
a
description
of
the
sights
the
irreverent
had
nicknamed
this
the
and
declared
that
the
company
maintained
a
fake
in
chinatown
and
a
fake
dive
in
the
bowery
and
hired
individuals
to
sit
and
be
stared
at
by
credulous
excursionists
from
oklahoma
and
kalamazoo
of
course
it
would
never
have
done
for
people
who
had
just
been
passed
into
society
to
climb
upon
a
but
they
were
permitted
to
get
into
the
subway
and
were
whirled
with
a
deafening
clatter
through
a
long
tunnel
of
steel
and
stone
and
then
they
got
out
and
climbed
a
steep
hill
like
any
common
mortals
and
stood
and
gazed
at
grant
tomb
a
huge
white
marble
edifice
upon
a
point
overlooking
the
hudson
architecturally
it
was
not
a
beautiful
structure
but
one
was
consoled
by
reflecting
that
the
hero
himself
would
not
have
cared
about
that
it
might
have
been
described
as
a
with
a
on
top
of
it
and
these
homely
and
familiar
articles
were
perhaps
not
altogether
out
of
keeping
with
the
character
of
the
humblest
great
man
who
ever
lived
the
view
up
the
river
was
magnificent
quite
the
finest
which
the
city
had
to
offer
but
it
was
ruined
by
a
hideous
placed
squarely
in
the
middle
of
it
and
this
again
was
not
inappropriate
it
was
typical
of
all
the
ways
of
the
city
it
was
a
city
which
had
grown
up
by
accident
with
nobody
to
care
about
it
or
to
help
it
it
was
huge
and
ungainly
crude
uncomfortable
and
grotesque
there
was
nowhere
in
it
a
beautiful
sight
upon
which
a
man
could
rest
his
eyes
without
having
them
tortured
by
something
ugly
near
by
at
the
foot
of
the
slope
of
the
river
drive
ran
a
hideous
and
across
the
river
the
beautiful
palisades
were
being
blown
to
pieces
to
make
paving
stone
and
meantime
were
covered
with
advertisements
of
and
if
there
was
a
beautiful
building
there
was
sure
to
be
a
tobacco
advertisement
beside
it
if
there
was
a
beautiful
avenue
there
were
trucks
and
overworked
horses
toiling
in
the
harness
if
there
was
a
beautiful
park
it
was
filled
with
wretched
outcast
men
nowhere
was
any
order
or
system
everything
was
struggling
for
itself
and
jarring
and
clashing
with
everything
else
and
this
broke
the
spell
of
power
which
the
titan
city
would
otherwise
have
produced
it
seemed
like
a
monstrous
heap
of
wasted
energies
a
mountain
in
perpetual
labour
and
producing
an
endless
series
of
abortions
the
men
and
women
in
it
were
wearing
themselves
out
with
toil
but
there
was
a
spell
laid
upon
them
so
that
struggle
as
they
might
they
accomplished
nothing
coming
out
of
the
church
montague
had
met
judge
ellis
and
the
judge
had
said
i
shall
soon
have
something
to
talk
over
with
you
so
montague
gave
him
his
address
and
a
day
or
two
later
came
an
invitation
to
lunch
with
him
at
his
club
the
judge
club
took
up
a
fifth
avenue
block
and
was
stately
and
imposing
it
had
been
formed
in
the
stress
of
the
civil
war
days
lean
and
hungry
heroes
had
come
home
from
battle
and
gone
into
business
and
those
who
had
succeeded
had
settled
down
here
to
rest
to
see
them
now
dozing
in
huge
you
would
have
had
a
hard
time
to
guess
that
they
had
ever
been
lean
and
hungry
heroes
they
were
diplomats
and
statesmen
bishops
and
lawyers
great
merchants
and
financiers
the
men
who
had
made
the
city
for
a
century
everything
here
was
decorous
and
grave
and
the
waiters
stole
about
with
noiseless
feet
montague
talked
with
the
judge
about
new
york
and
what
he
had
seen
of
it
and
the
people
he
had
met
and
about
his
father
and
the
war
and
about
the
recent
election
and
the
business
outlook
and
meantime
they
ordered
luncheon
and
when
they
had
got
to
the
cigars
the
judge
coughed
and
said
and
now
i
have
a
matter
of
business
to
talk
over
with
you
montague
settled
himself
to
listen
i
have
a
friend
the
judge
explained
a
very
good
friend
who
has
asked
me
to
find
him
a
lawyer
to
undertake
an
important
case
i
talked
the
matter
over
with
general
prentice
and
he
agreed
with
me
that
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
lay
the
matter
before
you
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
said
montague
the
matter
is
a
delicate
one
continued
the
other
it
has
to
do
with
life
insurance
are
you
familiar
with
the
insurance
business
not
at
all
i
had
supposed
not
said
the
judge
there
are
some
conditions
which
are
not
generally
known
about
but
which
i
may
say
to
put
it
mildly
are
not
altogether
satisfactory
my
friend
is
a
large
in
several
companies
and
he
is
not
satisfied
with
the
management
of
them
the
delicacy
of
the
situation
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
is
that
the
company
with
which
he
has
the
most
fault
to
find
is
one
in
which
i
myself
am
a
director
you
understand
perfectly
said
montague
what
company
is
it
the
fidelity
replied
the
other
and
his
companion
thought
in
a
flash
of
freddie
vandam
whom
he
had
met
at
castle
havens
for
the
fidelity
was
freddie
company
the
first
thing
that
i
have
to
ask
you
continued
the
judge
is
that
whether
you
care
to
take
the
case
or
not
you
will
consider
my
own
intervention
in
the
matter
absolutely
entre
nous
my
position
is
simply
this
i
have
protested
at
the
meetings
of
the
directors
of
the
company
against
what
i
consider
an
unwise
policy
and
my
protests
have
been
ignored
and
when
my
friend
asked
me
for
advice
i
gave
it
to
him
but
at
the
same
time
i
am
not
in
a
position
to
be
publicly
quoted
in
connexion
with
the
matter
you
follow
me
perfectly
said
the
other
i
will
agree
to
what
you
ask
very
good
now
then
the
condition
is
in
brief
this
the
companies
are
accumulating
an
enormous
surplus
which
under
the
law
belongs
to
the
but
the
administrations
of
the
various
companies
are
withholding
these
dividends
for
the
sake
of
the
which
these
accumulated
funds
afford
to
them
and
their
associates
this
is
as
i
hold
a
very
manifest
injustice
and
a
most
dangerous
condition
of
affairs
i
should
say
so
responded
montague
he
was
amazed
at
such
a
statement
coming
from
such
a
source
how
could
this
continue
he
asked
it
has
continued
for
a
long
time
the
judge
answered
but
why
is
it
not
known
it
is
perfectly
well
known
to
every
one
in
the
insurance
business
was
the
answer
the
matter
has
never
been
taken
up
or
published
simply
because
the
interests
involved
have
such
enormous
and
widely
extended
power
that
no
one
has
ever
dared
to
attack
them
montague
sat
forward
with
his
eyes
riveted
upon
the
judge
go
on
he
said
the
situation
is
simply
this
said
the
other
my
friend
hasbrook
wishes
to
bring
a
suit
against
the
fidelity
company
to
compel
it
to
pay
to
him
his
proper
share
of
its
surplus
he
wishes
the
suit
pressed
and
followed
to
the
court
of
last
resort
and
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
asked
montague
that
you
would
have
any
difficulty
to
find
a
lawyer
in
new
york
to
undertake
such
a
case
no
said
the
other
not
exactly
that
there
are
lawyers
in
new
york
who
would
undertake
anything
but
to
find
a
lawyer
of
standing
who
would
take
it
and
withstand
all
the
pressure
that
would
be
brought
to
bear
upon
him
that
might
take
some
time
you
astonish
me
judge
financial
interests
in
this
city
are
pretty
closely
tied
together
montague
of
course
there
are
law
firms
which
are
identified
with
interests
opposed
to
those
who
control
the
company
it
would
be
very
easy
to
get
them
to
take
the
case
but
you
can
see
that
in
that
event
my
friend
would
be
accused
of
bringing
the
suit
in
their
interest
whereas
he
wishes
it
to
appear
as
it
really
is
a
suit
of
an
independent
person
seeking
the
rights
of
the
vast
body
of
the
for
that
reason
he
wished
to
find
a
lawyer
who
was
identified
with
no
interest
of
any
sort
and
who
was
free
to
give
his
undivided
attention
to
the
issue
so
i
thought
of
you
i
will
take
the
case
said
montague
instantly
it
is
my
duty
to
warn
you
said
the
judge
gravely
that
you
will
be
taking
a
very
serious
step
you
must
be
prepared
to
face
powerful
and
i
am
afraid
unscrupulous
enemies
you
may
find
that
you
have
made
it
impossible
for
other
and
very
desirable
clients
to
deal
with
you
you
may
find
your
business
interests
if
you
have
any
embarrassed
your
credit
impaired
and
so
on
you
must
be
prepared
to
have
your
character
assailed
and
your
motives
impugned
in
the
public
press
you
may
find
that
social
pressure
will
be
brought
to
bear
on
you
so
it
is
a
step
from
which
most
young
men
who
have
their
careers
to
make
would
shrink
montague
face
had
turned
a
shade
paler
as
he
listened
i
am
assuming
he
said
that
the
facts
are
as
you
have
stated
them
to
me
that
an
unjust
condition
exists
you
may
assume
that
very
well
and
montague
clenched
his
hand
and
put
it
down
upon
the
table
i
will
take
the
case
he
said
for
a
few
moments
they
sat
in
silence
i
will
arrange
said
the
judge
at
last
for
you
and
hasbrook
to
meet
i
must
explain
to
you
as
a
matter
of
fairness
that
he
is
a
rich
man
and
will
be
able
to
pay
you
for
your
services
he
is
asking
a
great
deal
of
you
and
he
should
expect
to
pay
for
it
montague
sat
in
thought
i
have
not
really
had
time
to
get
my
bearings
in
new
york
he
said
at
last
i
think
i
had
best
leave
it
to
you
to
say
what
i
should
charge
him
if
i
were
in
your
position
the
judge
answered
i
think
that
i
should
ask
a
of
fifty
thousand
dollars
i
believe
he
will
expect
to
pay
at
least
that
montague
could
scarcely
repress
a
start
fifty
thousand
dollars
the
words
made
his
head
whirl
round
but
then
all
of
a
sudden
he
recalled
his
resolve
to
play
the
game
of
business
sternly
so
he
nodded
his
head
gravely
and
said
very
well
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
after
a
pause
he
added
i
hope
that
i
may
prove
able
to
handle
the
case
to
your
friend
satisfaction
your
ability
remains
for
you
to
prove
said
the
judge
i
have
only
been
in
position
to
assure
him
of
your
character
he
must
understand
of
course
said
montague
that
i
am
a
stranger
and
that
it
will
take
me
a
while
to
study
the
situation
of
course
he
knows
that
but
you
will
find
that
hasbrook
knows
a
good
deal
about
the
law
himself
and
he
has
already
had
a
lot
of
work
done
you
must
understand
that
it
is
very
easy
to
get
legal
advice
about
such
a
matter
what
is
sought
is
some
one
to
take
the
conduct
of
the
case
i
see
said
montague
and
the
judge
added
with
a
smile
some
one
to
get
up
on
horseback
and
draw
the
fire
of
the
enemy
and
then
the
great
man
was
as
usual
reminded
of
a
story
and
then
of
more
stories
until
at
last
they
rose
from
the
table
and
shook
hands
upon
their
bargain
and
parted
fifty
thousand
dollars
fifty
thousand
dollars
it
was
all
montague
could
do
to
keep
from
exclaiming
it
aloud
on
the
street
he
could
hardly
believe
that
it
was
a
reality
if
it
had
been
a
person
than
judge
ellis
he
would
have
suspected
that
some
one
must
be
playing
a
joke
upon
him
fifty
thousand
dollars
was
more
than
many
a
lawyer
made
at
home
in
a
lifetime
and
simply
as
a
in
one
case
the
problem
of
a
living
had
weighed
on
his
soul
ever
since
the
first
day
in
the
city
and
now
suddenly
it
was
solved
all
in
a
few
minutes
the
way
had
been
swept
clear
before
him
he
walked
home
as
if
upon
air
and
then
there
was
the
excitement
of
telling
the
family
about
it
he
had
an
idea
that
his
brother
might
be
alarmed
if
he
were
told
about
the
seriousness
of
the
case
and
so
he
simply
said
that
the
judge
had
brought
him
a
rich
client
and
that
it
was
an
insurance
case
oliver
who
knew
and
cared
nothing
about
law
asked
no
questions
and
contented
himself
with
saying
i
told
you
how
easy
it
was
to
make
money
in
new
york
if
only
you
knew
the
right
people
as
for
alice
she
had
known
all
along
that
her
cousin
was
a
great
man
and
that
clients
would
come
to
him
as
soon
as
he
hung
out
his
sign
his
sign
was
not
out
yet
by
the
way
that
was
the
next
thing
to
be
attended
to
he
must
get
himself
an
office
at
once
and
some
books
and
begin
to
read
up
insurance
law
and
so
bright
and
early
the
next
morning
he
took
the
subway
down
town
and
here
for
the
first
time
montague
saw
the
real
new
york
all
the
rest
was
mere
shadow
the
rest
was
where
men
slept
and
played
but
there
was
where
they
fought
out
the
battle
of
their
lives
here
the
fierce
intensity
of
it
smote
him
in
the
face
he
saw
the
cruel
waste
and
ruin
of
it
the
wreckage
of
the
blind
haphazard
strife
it
was
a
city
caught
in
a
trap
it
was
pent
in
at
one
end
of
a
narrow
little
island
it
had
been
no
one
business
to
foresee
that
it
must
some
day
outgrow
this
space
now
men
were
digging
a
score
of
tunnels
to
set
it
free
but
they
had
not
begun
these
until
the
pressure
had
become
unendurable
and
now
it
had
reached
its
climax
in
the
financial
district
land
had
been
sold
for
as
much
as
four
dollars
a
square
inch
huge
blocks
of
buildings
shot
up
to
the
sky
in
a
few
months
fifteen
twenty
stories
of
them
and
with
half
a
dozen
stories
hewn
out
of
the
solid
rock
beneath
there
was
to
be
one
building
of
stories
six
hundred
and
fifty
feet
in
height
and
between
them
were
narrow
chasms
of
streets
where
the
hurrying
crowds
overflowed
the
sidewalks
yet
other
streets
were
filled
with
trucks
and
heavy
vehicles
with
electric
cars
creeping
slowly
along
and
little
swirls
and
eddies
of
people
darting
across
here
and
there
these
huge
buildings
were
like
beehives
swarming
with
life
and
activity
with
scores
of
elevators
shooting
through
them
at
bewildering
speed
everywhere
was
the
atmosphere
of
rush
the
spirit
of
it
seized
hold
of
one
and
he
began
to
hurry
even
though
he
had
no
place
to
go
the
man
who
walked
slowly
and
looked
about
him
was
in
the
way
he
was
jostled
here
and
there
and
people
eyed
him
with
suspicion
and
annoyance
elsewhere
on
the
island
men
did
the
work
of
the
city
here
they
did
the
work
of
the
world
each
room
in
these
endless
mazes
of
buildings
was
a
cell
in
a
mighty
brain
the
telephone
wires
were
nerves
and
by
the
whole
huge
organism
the
thinking
and
willing
of
a
continent
were
done
it
was
a
noisy
place
to
the
physical
ear
but
to
the
ear
of
the
mind
it
roared
with
the
roaring
of
a
thousand
niagaras
here
was
the
stock
exchange
where
the
scales
of
trade
were
held
before
the
eyes
of
the
country
here
was
the
where
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
were
exchanged
every
day
here
were
the
great
banks
the
reservoirs
into
which
the
streams
of
the
country
wealth
were
poured
here
were
the
brains
of
the
great
railroad
systems
of
the
telegraph
and
telephone
systems
of
mines
and
mills
and
factories
here
were
the
centres
of
the
country
trade
in
one
place
the
shipping
trade
in
another
the
jewellery
trade
the
grocery
trade
the
leather
trade
a
little
farther
up
town
was
the
clothing
district
where
one
might
see
the
signs
of
more
hebrews
than
all
jerusalem
had
ever
held
in
yet
other
districts
were
the
newspaper
offices
and
the
centre
of
the
magazine
and
business
of
the
whole
country
one
might
climb
to
the
top
of
one
of
the
great
and
gaze
down
upon
a
wilderness
of
houses
with
roofs
as
innumerable
as
and
people
looking
like
tiny
insects
below
or
one
might
go
out
into
the
harbour
late
upon
a
winter
afternoon
and
see
it
as
a
city
of
a
million
lights
rising
like
an
incantation
from
the
sea
round
about
it
was
an
unbroken
ring
of
docks
with
and
tugs
darting
everywhere
and
vessels
which
had
come
from
every
port
in
the
world
emptying
their
cargoes
into
the
huge
maw
of
the
metropolis
and
of
all
this
nothing
had
been
planned
all
lay
just
as
it
had
fallen
and
men
bore
the
confusion
and
the
waste
as
best
they
could
here
were
huge
steel
vaults
in
which
lay
many
billions
of
worth
of
securities
the
control
of
the
finances
of
the
country
and
a
block
or
two
in
one
direction
were
warehouses
and
and
in
another
direction
cheap
and
and
at
a
certain
hour
all
this
huge
machine
would
come
to
a
halt
and
its
millions
of
human
units
would
make
a
blind
rush
for
their
homes
then
at
the
entrances
to
bridges
and
ferries
and
trams
would
be
seen
sights
of
madness
and
terror
throngs
of
men
and
women
swept
hither
and
thither
pushing
and
struggling
shouting
cursing
fighting
now
and
then
in
sudden
panic
fear
all
decency
was
forgotten
here
people
would
be
mashed
into
cars
like
football
players
in
a
heap
and
guards
and
policemen
would
jam
the
gates
tight
or
like
as
not
be
swept
away
themselves
in
the
pushing
grunting
writhing
mass
of
human
beings
women
would
faint
and
be
trampled
men
would
come
out
with
clothing
torn
to
shreds
and
sometimes
with
broken
arms
or
ribs
and
thinking
people
would
gaze
at
the
sight
and
shudder
wondering
how
long
a
city
could
hold
together
when
the
masses
of
its
population
were
thus
forced
back
day
after
day
habitually
upon
the
elemental
brute
within
them
in
this
vast
business
district
montague
would
have
felt
utterly
lost
and
helpless
if
it
had
not
been
for
that
fifty
thousand
dollars
and
the
sense
of
mastery
which
it
gave
him
he
sought
out
general
prentice
and
under
his
guidance
selected
his
suite
of
rooms
and
got
his
furniture
and
books
in
readiness
and
a
day
or
two
later
by
appointment
came
hasbrook
he
was
a
wiry
nervous
little
man
who
did
not
impress
one
as
much
of
a
personality
but
he
had
the
insurance
situation
at
his
ends
his
grievance
had
evidently
wrought
upon
him
certainly
if
half
of
what
he
alleged
were
true
it
was
time
that
the
courts
took
hold
of
the
affair
montague
spent
the
whole
day
in
consultation
going
over
every
aspect
of
the
case
and
laying
out
his
course
of
procedure
and
then
at
the
end
hasbrook
remarked
that
it
would
be
necessary
for
them
to
make
some
financial
arrangement
and
the
other
set
his
teeth
together
and
took
a
tight
grip
upon
himself
and
said
considering
the
importance
of
the
case
and
all
the
circumstances
i
think
i
should
have
a
retainer
of
fifty
thousand
dollars
and
the
little
man
never
turned
a
hair
that
will
be
perfectly
satisfactory
he
said
i
will
attend
to
it
at
once
and
the
heart
gave
a
great
leap
and
sure
enough
the
next
morning
mail
brought
the
money
in
the
shape
of
a
cashier
cheque
from
one
of
the
big
banks
montague
deposited
it
to
his
own
account
and
felt
that
the
city
was
his
and
so
he
flung
himself
into
the
work
he
went
to
his
office
every
day
and
he
shut
himself
up
in
his
own
rooms
in
the
evening
winnie
was
in
despair
because
he
would
not
come
and
learn
bridge
and
vivie
patton
sought
him
in
vain
for
a
party
he
could
not
exactly
say
that
while
the
others
slept
he
was
toiling
upward
in
the
night
for
the
others
did
not
sleep
in
the
night
but
he
could
say
that
while
they
were
feasting
and
dancing
he
was
delving
into
insurance
law
oliver
argued
in
vain
to
make
him
realize
that
he
could
not
live
for
ever
upon
one
client
and
that
it
was
as
important
for
a
lawyer
to
be
a
social
light
as
to
win
his
first
big
case
montague
was
so
absorbed
that
he
even
failed
to
be
thrilled
when
one
morning
he
opened
an
invitation
envelope
and
read
the
fateful
legend
devon
requests
the
honour
of
your
company
telling
him
that
he
had
passed
on
that
critical
examination
morning
and
that
he
was
definitely
and
irrevocably
in
society
chapter
xii
montague
was
now
a
capitalist
and
therefore
a
keeper
of
the
gates
of
opportunity
it
seemed
as
though
the
seekers
for
admission
must
have
had
some
occult
way
of
finding
it
out
almost
immediately
they
began
to
lay
siege
to
him
about
a
week
after
his
cheque
arrived
major
thorne
whom
he
had
met
the
first
evening
at
the
loyal
legion
called
him
up
and
asked
to
see
him
and
he
came
to
montague
room
that
evening
and
after
chatting
awhile
about
old
times
proceeded
to
unfold
a
business
proposition
it
seemed
that
the
major
had
a
grandson
a
young
mechanical
engineer
who
had
been
labouring
for
a
couple
of
years
at
a
very
important
invention
a
device
for
loading
coal
upon
steamships
and
weighing
it
automatically
in
the
process
it
was
a
very
complicated
problem
needless
to
say
but
it
had
been
solved
successfully
and
patents
had
been
applied
for
and
a
working
model
constructed
but
it
had
proved
unexpectedly
difficult
to
interest
the
officials
of
the
great
steamship
companies
in
the
device
there
was
no
doubt
about
the
practicability
of
the
machine
or
the
economies
it
would
effect
but
the
officials
raised
trivial
objections
and
caused
delays
and
offered
prices
that
were
ridiculously
inadequate
so
the
young
inventor
had
conceived
the
idea
of
organizing
a
company
to
manufacture
the
machines
and
rent
them
upon
a
royalty
i
did
know
whether
you
would
have
any
money
said
major
thorne
but
i
thought
you
might
be
in
touch
with
others
who
could
be
got
to
look
into
the
matter
there
is
a
fortune
in
it
for
those
who
take
it
up
montague
was
interested
and
he
looked
over
the
plans
and
descriptions
which
his
friend
had
brought
and
said
that
he
would
see
the
working
model
and
talk
the
proposition
over
with
others
and
so
the
major
took
his
departure
the
first
person
montague
spoke
to
about
it
was
oliver
with
whom
he
chanced
to
be
lunching
at
the
latter
club
this
was
the
all
night
club
a
of
fast
young
society
men
and
millionaire
bohemians
who
made
a
practice
of
going
to
bed
at
daylight
and
had
taken
for
their
motto
the
words
of
tennyson
for
men
may
come
and
men
may
go
but
i
go
on
for
ever
it
was
not
a
proper
club
for
his
brother
to
join
oliver
considered
montague
game
was
the
heavy
respectable
and
the
person
to
put
him
up
was
general
prentice
but
he
was
permitted
to
lunch
there
with
his
brother
to
chaperon
him
and
also
reggie
mann
who
happened
in
fresh
from
talking
over
the
itinerary
of
the
foreign
prince
with
and
bringing
a
diverting
account
of
how
had
had
a
fisticuffs
with
her
maid
montague
mentioned
the
invention
casually
and
with
no
idea
that
his
brother
would
have
an
opinion
one
way
or
the
other
but
oliver
had
quite
a
vigorous
opinion
good
god
allan
you
are
going
to
let
yourself
be
persuaded
into
a
thing
like
that
but
what
do
you
know
about
it
asked
the
other
it
may
be
a
tremendous
thing
of
course
cried
oliver
but
what
can
you
tell
about
it
you
be
like
a
child
in
other
people
hands
and
they
be
certain
to
rob
you
and
why
in
the
world
do
you
want
to
take
risks
when
you
do
have
to
i
have
to
put
my
money
somewhere
said
montague
his
first
fee
is
burning
a
hole
in
his
pocket
put
in
reggie
mann
with
a
chuckle
turn
it
over
to
me
montague
and
let
me
spend
it
in
a
gorgeous
entertainment
for
alice
and
the
prestige
of
it
will
bring
you
more
cases
than
you
can
handle
in
a
lifetime
he
had
much
better
spend
it
all
for
soda
water
than
buy
a
lot
of
coal
chutes
with
it
said
oliver
wait
awhile
and
let
me
find
you
some
place
to
put
your
money
and
you
see
that
you
do
have
to
take
any
risks
i
had
no
idea
of
taking
it
up
until
i
made
certain
of
it
replied
the
other
and
those
whose
judgment
i
took
would
of
course
go
in
also
the
younger
man
thought
for
a
moment
you
are
going
to
dine
with
major
venable
are
you
he
asked
and
when
the
other
answered
in
the
affirmative
he
continued
very
well
then
ask
him
the
been
a
capitalist
for
forty
years
and
if
you
can
get
him
to
take
it
up
why
you
know
you
safe
major
venable
had
taken
quite
a
fancy
to
montague
perhaps
the
old
gentleman
liked
to
have
somebody
to
gossip
with
to
whom
all
his
anecdotes
were
new
he
had
seconded
montague
name
at
the
millionaires
where
he
lived
and
had
asked
him
there
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
some
of
the
other
members
before
montague
parted
with
his
brother
he
promised
that
he
would
talk
the
matter
over
with
the
major
the
millionaires
was
the
show
club
of
the
city
the
one
which
the
ineffably
rich
had
set
apart
for
themselves
it
was
up
by
the
park
in
a
magnificent
white
marble
palace
which
had
cost
a
million
dollars
montague
felt
that
he
had
never
really
known
the
major
until
he
saw
him
here
the
major
was
excellent
at
all
times
and
places
but
in
this
club
he
became
an
edition
de
luxe
of
himself
he
made
his
headquarters
here
keeping
his
suite
of
rooms
all
the
year
round
and
the
atmosphere
and
surroundings
of
the
place
seemed
to
be
a
part
of
him
montague
thought
that
the
major
face
grew
redder
every
day
and
the
purple
veins
in
it
purpler
or
was
it
that
the
old
gentleman
shirt
bosom
gleamed
more
brightly
in
the
glare
of
the
lights
the
major
met
him
in
the
stately
entrance
hall
fifty
feet
square
and
all
of
numidian
marble
with
a
ceiling
of
gold
and
a
great
bronze
stairway
leading
to
the
gallery
above
he
apologized
for
his
velvet
slippers
and
for
his
hobbling
walk
he
was
getting
his
accursed
gout
again
but
he
limped
around
and
introduced
his
friend
to
the
other
millionaires
and
then
told
scandal
about
them
behind
their
backs
the
major
was
the
very
type
of
a
old
aristocrat
he
was
all
noblesse
oblige
to
those
within
the
magic
circle
of
his
intimacy
but
alas
for
those
outside
it
montague
had
never
heard
anyone
bully
servants
as
the
major
did
here
you
he
would
cry
when
something
went
wrong
at
the
table
do
you
know
any
better
than
to
bring
me
a
dish
like
that
go
and
send
me
somebody
who
knows
how
to
set
a
table
and
strange
to
say
the
servants
all
acknowledged
his
perfect
right
to
bully
them
and
flew
with
terrified
alacrity
to
do
his
bidding
montague
noticed
that
the
whole
staff
of
the
club
leaped
into
activity
whenever
the
major
appeared
and
when
he
was
seated
at
the
table
he
led
off
in
this
fashion
now
i
want
two
dry
martinis
and
i
want
them
at
once
do
you
understand
me
do
stop
to
get
me
any
butter
plates
or
i
want
two
just
as
quick
as
you
can
carry
them
dinner
was
an
important
event
to
major
venable
the
most
important
in
life
the
younger
man
humbly
declined
to
make
any
suggestions
and
sat
and
watched
while
his
friend
did
all
the
ordering
they
had
some
very
small
oysters
and
an
onion
soup
and
a
grouse
and
asparagus
with
some
wine
from
the
major
own
private
store
and
then
a
romaine
salad
concerning
each
one
of
these
courses
the
major
gave
special
injunctions
and
throughout
his
conversation
he
scattered
comments
upon
them
this
is
good
thick
soup
lots
of
nourishment
in
onion
soup
have
the
rest
of
this
i
think
the
burgundy
is
too
cold
is
as
cold
as
burgundy
ought
ever
to
be
i
do
mind
sherry
as
low
as
they
always
cook
a
bird
too
much
robbie
walling
chef
is
the
only
person
i
know
who
never
makes
a
mistake
with
game
all
this
of
course
was
between
comments
upon
the
assembled
millionaires
there
was
hawkins
the
corporation
lawyer
a
shrewd
fellow
cold
as
a
corpse
he
was
named
for
an
ambassadorship
a
very
efficient
man
used
to
be
old
wyman
confidential
adviser
and
buy
aldermen
for
and
the
man
at
table
with
him
was
harrison
publisher
of
the
star
administration
newspaper
sound
and
conservative
harrison
was
training
for
a
cabinet
position
he
was
a
nice
little
man
and
would
make
a
fine
splurge
in
and
that
tall
man
coming
in
was
clarke
the
steel
magnate
and
over
there
was
adams
a
big
lawyer
also
prominent
reformer
civic
righteousness
and
all
that
sort
of
stuff
represented
the
oil
trust
secretly
and
went
down
to
trenton
to
argue
against
some
reform
measure
and
took
along
fifty
thousand
dollars
in
bills
in
his
valise
a
friend
of
mine
got
wind
of
what
he
was
doing
and
taxed
him
with
it
said
the
major
and
laughed
gleefully
over
the
great
lawyer
reply
how
did
i
know
but
i
might
have
to
pay
for
my
own
lunch
and
the
fat
man
with
him
that
was
jimmie
featherstone
the
chap
who
had
inherited
a
big
estate
poor
jimmie
going
all
to
pieces
the
major
declared
goes
down
town
to
board
meetings
now
and
then
they
tell
a
story
about
him
and
old
dan
waterman
he
had
got
up
and
started
a
long
argument
when
waterman
broke
in
at
the
earlier
meeting
you
argued
directly
to
the
contrary
mr
featherstone
i
said
jimmie
looking
bewildered
wonder
why
i
did
that
featherstone
since
you
ask
me
i
tell
you
said
old
dan
he
savage
as
a
wild
boar
you
know
and
wo
be
delayed
at
meetings
reason
is
that
the
last
time
you
were
drunker
than
you
are
now
if
you
would
adopt
a
uniform
standard
of
intoxication
for
the
directors
meetings
of
this
road
it
would
expedite
matters
considerably
they
had
got
as
far
as
the
romaine
salad
the
waiter
came
with
a
bowl
of
dressing
and
at
the
sight
of
it
the
old
gentleman
forgot
jimmie
featherstone
why
are
you
bringing
me
that
stuff
he
cried
i
want
that
take
it
away
and
get
me
some
vinegar
and
oil
the
waiter
fled
in
dismay
while
the
major
went
on
growling
under
his
breath
then
from
behind
him
came
a
voice
what
the
matter
with
you
this
evening
venable
you
peevish
the
major
looked
up
hello
you
old
cormorant
said
he
how
do
you
do
these
days
the
old
cormorant
replied
that
he
did
very
well
he
was
a
pudgy
little
man
with
a
wrinkled
face
my
friend
montague
symmes
said
the
major
i
am
very
pleased
to
meet
you
montague
said
symmes
peering
over
his
spectacles
and
what
are
you
doing
with
yourself
these
days
asked
the
major
the
other
smiled
genially
nothing
much
said
he
seducing
my
friends
wives
as
usual
and
who
the
latest
read
the
newspapers
and
you
find
out
laughed
symmes
i
told
i
being
shadowed
he
passed
on
down
the
room
chuckling
to
himself
and
the
major
said
that
maltby
symmes
have
you
heard
of
him
no
said
montague
he
gets
into
the
papers
a
good
deal
he
was
up
in
supplementary
proceedings
the
other
day
could
pay
his
liquor
bill
a
member
of
the
millionaires
laughed
montague
yes
the
papers
made
quite
a
joke
out
of
it
said
the
other
but
you
see
he
run
through
a
couple
of
fortunes
the
last
was
his
mother
eleven
millions
i
believe
he
been
a
pretty
lively
old
boy
in
his
time
the
vinegar
and
oil
had
now
arrived
and
the
major
set
to
work
to
dress
the
salad
this
was
quite
a
ceremony
and
montague
took
it
with
amused
interest
the
major
first
gathered
all
the
necessary
articles
together
and
looked
them
all
over
and
grumbled
at
them
then
he
mixed
the
vinegar
and
the
pepper
and
salt
a
tablespoonful
at
a
time
and
poured
it
over
the
salad
then
very
slowly
and
carefully
the
oil
had
to
be
poured
on
the
salad
being
poked
and
turned
about
so
that
it
would
be
all
absorbed
perhaps
it
was
because
he
was
so
busy
narrating
the
escapades
of
maltby
symmes
that
the
old
gentleman
kneaded
it
about
so
long
all
the
time
fussing
over
it
like
a
with
her
chicks
and
interrupting
himself
every
sentence
or
two
it
was
lenore
the
opera
star
and
he
gave
her
about
two
hundred
thousand
worth
of
railroad
shares
really
you
know
romaine
ought
not
to
be
served
in
a
bowl
at
all
but
in
a
square
flat
dish
so
that
one
could
keep
the
ends
quite
dry
and
when
they
quarrelled
she
found
the
old
scamp
had
fooled
her
the
shares
had
never
been
transferred
one
is
not
supposed
to
use
a
fork
at
all
you
know
but
she
sued
him
and
he
settled
with
her
for
about
half
the
value
if
this
dressing
were
done
properly
there
ought
not
to
be
any
oil
in
the
bottom
of
the
dish
at
all
this
last
remark
meant
that
the
process
had
reached
its
climax
that
the
long
crisp
leaves
were
receiving
their
final
affectionate
overturnings
while
the
waiter
stood
at
respectful
attention
two
or
three
pieces
at
a
time
were
laid
carefully
upon
the
little
silver
plate
intended
for
montague
and
now
said
the
triumphant
host
try
it
if
it
good
it
ought
to
be
neither
sweet
nor
bitter
but
just
right
and
he
watched
anxiously
while
montague
tasted
it
saying
if
it
the
least
bit
bitter
say
so
and
we
send
it
out
i
told
them
about
it
often
enough
before
but
it
was
not
bitter
and
so
the
major
proceeded
to
help
himself
after
which
the
waiter
whisked
the
bowl
away
i
told
that
salad
is
the
one
vegetable
we
have
from
the
romans
said
the
old
boy
as
he
munched
at
the
crisp
green
leaves
it
mentioned
by
horace
you
as
i
was
saying
all
this
was
in
symmes
early
days
but
since
his
son
been
grown
up
he
married
another
after
the
salad
the
major
had
another
cocktail
in
the
beginning
montague
had
noticed
that
his
hands
shook
and
his
eyes
were
watery
but
now
after
these
copious
libations
he
was
vigorous
and
if
possible
more
full
of
anecdotes
than
ever
montague
thought
that
it
would
be
a
good
time
to
broach
his
inquiry
and
so
when
the
coffee
had
been
served
he
asked
have
you
any
objections
to
talking
business
after
dinner
not
with
you
said
the
major
why
what
is
it
and
then
montague
told
him
about
his
friend
proposition
and
described
the
invention
the
other
listened
attentively
to
the
end
and
then
after
a
pause
montague
asked
him
what
do
you
think
of
it
the
invention
no
good
said
the
major
promptly
how
do
you
know
asked
the
other
because
if
it
had
been
the
companies
would
have
taken
it
long
ago
without
paying
him
a
cent
but
he
has
it
patented
said
montague
patented
hell
replied
the
other
what
a
patent
to
lawyers
of
concerns
of
that
size
they
have
taken
it
and
had
it
in
use
from
maine
to
texas
and
when
he
sued
they
have
tied
the
case
up
in
so
many
technicalities
and
quibbles
that
he
could
have
got
to
the
end
of
it
in
ten
years
and
he
have
been
ruined
ten
times
over
in
the
process
is
that
really
done
asked
montague
done
exclaimed
the
major
it
done
so
often
you
might
say
it
the
only
thing
that
the
people
are
probably
trying
to
take
you
in
with
a
fake
that
could
possibly
be
so
responded
the
other
the
man
is
a
friend
i
found
it
an
excellent
rule
never
to
do
business
with
friends
said
the
major
grimly
but
listen
said
montague
and
he
argued
long
enough
to
convince
his
companion
that
that
could
not
be
the
true
explanation
then
the
major
sat
for
a
minute
or
two
and
pondered
and
suddenly
he
exclaimed
i
have
it
i
see
why
they
wo
touch
it
what
is
it
it
the
coal
companies
they
giving
the
steamships
short
weight
and
they
do
want
the
coal
weighed
truly
but
there
no
sense
in
that
said
montague
it
the
steamship
companies
that
wo
take
the
machine
yes
said
the
major
naturally
their
officers
are
sharing
the
graft
and
he
laughed
heartily
at
montague
look
of
perplexity
do
you
know
anything
about
the
business
montague
asked
nothing
whatever
said
the
major
i
am
like
the
german
who
shut
himself
up
in
his
inner
consciousness
and
deduced
the
shape
of
an
elephant
from
first
principles
i
know
the
game
of
big
business
from
a
to
z
and
i
telling
you
that
if
the
invention
is
good
and
the
companies
wo
take
it
that
the
reason
and
i
lay
you
a
wager
that
if
you
were
to
make
an
investigation
some
such
thing
as
that
is
what
you
find
last
winter
i
went
south
on
a
steamer
and
when
we
got
near
port
i
saw
them
dumping
a
ton
or
two
of
good
food
overboard
and
i
made
inquiries
and
learned
that
one
of
the
officials
of
the
company
ran
a
farm
and
furnished
the
stuff
and
the
orders
were
to
get
rid
of
so
much
every
trip
montague
jaw
had
fallen
what
could
major
thorne
do
against
such
a
combination
he
asked
i
do
know
said
the
major
shrugging
his
shoulders
it
a
case
to
take
to
a
lawyer
one
who
knows
the
ropes
hawkins
over
there
would
know
what
to
tell
you
i
should
imagine
the
thing
he
advise
would
be
to
call
a
strike
of
the
men
who
handle
the
coal
and
tie
up
the
companies
and
bring
them
to
terms
you
joking
now
exclaimed
the
other
not
at
all
said
the
major
laughing
again
it
done
all
the
time
there
a
building
trust
in
this
city
and
the
way
it
put
all
its
rivals
out
of
business
was
by
having
strikes
called
on
their
jobs
but
how
could
it
do
that
easiest
thing
in
the
world
a
labour
leader
is
a
man
with
a
great
deal
of
power
and
a
very
small
salary
to
live
on
and
even
if
he
wo
sell
out
there
are
other
ways
i
could
introduce
you
to
a
man
right
in
this
room
who
had
a
big
strike
on
at
an
inconvenient
time
and
he
had
the
president
of
the
union
trapped
in
a
hotel
with
a
woman
and
the
poor
fellow
gave
in
and
called
off
the
strike
i
should
think
the
strikers
might
sometimes
get
out
of
hand
said
montague
sometimes
they
do
smiled
the
other
there
is
a
regular
procedure
for
that
case
then
you
hire
detectives
and
start
violence
and
call
out
the
militia
and
put
the
strike
leaders
into
jail
montague
could
think
of
nothing
to
say
to
that
the
programme
seemed
to
be
complete
you
see
the
major
continued
earnestly
i
advising
you
as
a
friend
and
i
taking
the
point
of
view
of
a
man
who
has
money
in
his
pocket
i
had
some
there
always
but
i
had
to
work
hard
to
keep
it
there
all
my
life
i
been
surrounded
by
people
who
wanted
to
do
me
good
and
the
way
they
wanted
to
do
it
was
to
exchange
my
real
money
for
pieces
of
paper
which
they
had
printed
with
fancy
and
eagles
and
flags
of
course
if
you
want
to
look
at
the
thing
from
the
other
side
why
then
the
invention
is
most
ingenious
and
trade
is
booming
just
now
and
this
is
a
great
country
and
merit
is
all
you
need
in
it
and
everything
else
is
just
as
it
ought
to
be
it
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world
you
know
whether
a
man
is
buying
a
horse
or
selling
him
montague
had
observed
with
perplexity
that
such
incendiary
talk
as
this
was
one
of
the
characteristics
of
people
in
these
lofty
altitudes
it
was
one
of
the
liberties
accorded
to
their
station
editors
and
bishops
and
statesmen
and
all
the
rest
of
their
retainers
had
to
believe
in
the
respectabilities
even
in
the
privacy
of
their
clubs
the
people
ears
were
getting
terribly
sharp
these
days
but
among
the
real
giants
of
business
you
might
have
thought
yourself
in
a
society
of
revolutionists
they
would
tear
up
the
mountain
tops
and
hurl
them
at
each
other
when
one
of
these
old
once
got
started
he
would
tell
tales
of
deviltry
to
appall
the
soul
of
the
hardiest
man
it
was
always
the
other
fellow
of
course
but
then
if
you
pinned
your
man
down
and
if
he
thought
that
he
could
trust
you
he
would
acknowledge
that
he
had
sometimes
fought
the
enemy
with
the
enemy
own
weapons
but
of
course
one
must
understand
that
all
this
radicalism
was
for
conversational
purposes
only
the
major
for
instance
never
had
the
slightest
idea
of
doing
anything
about
all
the
evils
of
which
he
told
when
it
came
to
action
he
proposed
to
do
just
what
he
had
done
all
his
life
to
sit
tight
on
his
own
little
pile
and
the
millionaires
was
an
excellent
place
to
learn
to
do
it
see
that
old
over
there
in
the
corner
said
the
major
he
a
man
you
want
to
fix
in
your
mind
old
henry
grimes
have
you
heard
of
him
vaguely
said
the
other
he
laura
hegan
uncle
she
have
his
money
also
some
day
but
lord
how
he
does
hold
on
to
it
meantime
it
quite
tragic
if
you
come
to
know
him
he
frightened
at
his
own
shadow
he
goes
in
for
slum
tenements
and
i
guess
he
evicts
more
people
in
a
month
than
you
could
crowd
into
this
building
montague
looked
at
the
solitary
figure
at
the
table
a
man
with
a
little
face
like
a
weasel
and
a
big
napkin
tied
around
his
neck
that
so
as
to
save
his
for
the
major
explained
he
really
only
about
sixty
but
you
think
he
was
eighty
three
times
every
day
he
sits
here
and
eats
a
bowl
of
graham
crackers
and
milk
and
then
goes
out
and
sits
rigid
in
an
for
an
hour
that
the
regimen
his
doctors
have
put
him
on
angels
and
ministers
of
grace
defend
us
the
old
gentleman
paused
and
a
chuckle
shook
his
scarlet
jowls
only
think
he
said
they
tried
to
do
that
to
me
but
no
sir
when
bob
venable
has
to
eat
graham
crackers
and
milk
he
put
in
arsenic
instead
of
sugar
that
the
way
with
many
a
one
of
these
rich
fellows
though
you
picture
him
living
in
capuan
luxury
when
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
a
man
with
a
torpid
liver
and
a
weak
stomach
who
is
put
to
bed
at
ten
with
a
bag
and
a
flannel
the
two
had
got
up
and
were
strolling
toward
the
when
suddenly
at
one
side
a
door
opened
and
a
group
of
men
came
out
at
the
head
of
them
was
an
extraordinary
figure
a
big
powerful
body
with
a
grim
face
hello
said
the
major
all
the
big
bugs
are
here
there
must
be
a
governors
meeting
who
is
that
asked
his
companion
and
he
answered
that
why
dan
waterman
dan
waterman
montague
stared
harder
than
ever
and
now
he
identified
the
face
with
the
pictures
he
had
seen
waterman
the
colossus
of
finance
the
croesus
of
copper
and
gold
how
many
trusts
had
waterman
organized
and
how
many
puns
had
been
made
upon
that
name
of
his
who
are
the
other
men
montague
asked
oh
they
just
little
millionaires
was
the
reply
the
little
millionaires
were
following
as
a
kind
of
one
of
them
who
was
short
and
pudgy
was
half
running
to
keep
up
with
waterman
heavy
stride
when
they
came
to
the
they
crowded
the
attendants
away
and
one
helped
the
great
man
on
with
his
coat
and
another
held
his
hat
and
another
his
stick
and
two
others
tried
to
talk
to
him
and
waterman
stolidly
buttoned
his
coat
and
then
seized
his
hat
and
stick
and
without
a
word
to
anyone
bolted
through
the
door
it
was
one
of
the
funniest
sights
that
montague
had
ever
seen
in
his
life
and
he
laughed
all
the
way
into
the
and
when
major
venable
had
settled
himself
in
a
big
chair
and
bitten
off
the
end
of
a
cigar
and
lighted
it
what
floodgates
of
reminiscence
were
opened
for
dan
waterman
was
one
of
the
major
own
generation
and
he
knew
all
his
life
and
his
habits
just
as
montague
had
seen
him
there
so
he
had
been
always
swift
imperious
terrible
trampling
over
all
opposition
the
most
powerful
men
in
the
city
quailed
before
the
glare
of
his
eyes
in
the
old
days
wall
street
had
reeled
in
the
shock
of
the
conflicts
between
him
and
his
most
powerful
rival
and
the
major
went
on
to
tell
about
waterman
rival
and
his
life
he
had
been
the
city
old
wyman
had
been
made
by
him
he
was
the
prince
among
political
financiers
he
had
ruled
the
democratic
party
in
state
and
nation
he
would
give
a
quarter
of
a
million
at
a
time
to
the
boss
of
tammany
hall
and
spend
a
million
in
a
single
campaign
on
when
the
district
leaders
came
to
get
the
election
funds
there
would
be
a
table
forty
feet
long
completely
covered
with
bills
he
would
have
been
the
richest
man
in
america
save
that
he
spent
his
money
as
fast
as
he
got
it
he
had
had
the
most
famous
in
america
and
a
house
on
fifth
avenue
that
was
said
to
be
the
finest
italian
palace
in
the
world
over
three
millions
had
been
spent
in
decorating
it
all
the
ceilings
had
been
brought
intact
from
palaces
abroad
which
he
had
bought
and
demolished
the
major
told
a
story
to
show
how
such
a
man
lost
all
sense
of
the
value
of
money
he
had
once
been
sitting
at
lunch
with
him
when
the
editor
of
one
of
his
newspapers
had
come
in
and
remarked
i
told
you
we
would
need
eight
thousand
dollars
and
the
check
you
send
is
for
ten
i
know
it
was
the
smiling
answer
but
somehow
i
thought
eight
seemed
harder
to
write
than
ten
old
waterman
quite
a
spender
too
when
it
comes
to
that
the
major
went
on
he
told
me
once
that
it
cost
him
five
thousand
dollars
a
day
for
his
ordinary
expenses
and
that
does
include
a
yacht
nor
even
the
expenses
of
it
and
think
of
another
man
i
know
of
who
spent
a
million
dollars
for
a
granite
pier
so
that
he
could
land
and
see
his
mistress
it
a
fact
as
sure
as
god
made
me
she
was
a
society
woman
but
she
was
poor
and
he
did
dare
to
make
her
rich
for
fear
of
the
scandal
so
she
had
to
live
in
a
miserable
villa
and
when
other
people
children
would
sneer
at
her
children
because
they
lived
in
a
villa
the
answer
would
be
you
got
any
pier
and
if
you
do
believe
that
but
here
suddenly
the
major
turned
and
observed
a
boy
who
had
brought
him
some
cigars
and
who
was
now
standing
near
by
pretending
to
straighten
out
some
newspapers
upon
the
table
here
sir
cried
the
major
what
do
you
mean
listening
to
what
i
saying
out
of
the
room
with
you
now
you
rascal
chapter
xiii
another
came
and
with
it
an
invitation
from
the
lester
todds
to
visit
them
at
their
country
place
in
new
jersey
montague
was
buried
in
his
books
but
his
brother
routed
him
out
with
strenuous
protests
his
case
be
damned
was
he
going
to
ruin
his
career
for
one
case
at
all
hazards
he
must
meet
people
people
who
counted
and
the
todds
were
such
a
big
money
crowd
and
a
power
in
the
insurance
world
if
montague
were
going
to
be
an
insurance
lawyer
he
could
not
possibly
decline
their
invitation
freddie
vandam
would
be
a
guest
and
montague
smiled
at
the
tidings
that
betty
wyman
would
be
there
also
he
had
observed
that
his
brother
visits
always
happened
at
places
where
betty
was
and
where
betty
granddaddy
was
not
so
montague
man
packed
his
grips
and
alice
maid
her
trunks
and
they
rode
with
a
party
to
a
remote
jersey
suburb
and
were
whirled
in
an
auto
up
a
broad
shell
road
to
a
palace
upon
the
top
of
a
mountain
here
lived
the
haughty
lester
todds
and
scattered
about
on
the
neighbouring
hills
a
set
of
the
who
had
withdrawn
to
this
seclusion
they
were
exceedingly
classy
they
affected
to
regard
all
the
society
of
the
city
with
scorn
and
had
their
own
diversions
an
horse
show
in
summer
and
in
the
fall
in
fancy
uniforms
the
lester
todds
themselves
were
ardent
pursuers
of
all
varieties
of
game
and
in
various
clubs
and
private
preserves
they
followed
the
seasons
from
florida
and
north
carolina
to
ontario
with
occasional
side
trips
to
norway
and
new
brunswick
and
british
columbia
here
at
home
they
had
a
whole
mountain
of
virgin
forest
carefully
preserved
and
in
the
renaissance
palace
at
the
they
carelessly
referred
to
as
a
lodge
you
would
find
such
articles
de
vertu
as
a
table
with
a
set
of
chairs
and
quite
rugs
at
ten
and
twenty
thousand
dollars
all
these
prices
you
might
ascertain
without
any
difficulty
at
all
because
there
were
many
newspaper
articles
describing
the
house
to
be
read
in
an
album
in
the
hall
on
saturday
afternoons
todd
welcomed
the
neighbours
in
a
pastel
grey
the
front
of
which
contained
a
peacock
embroidered
in
silk
with
jewels
in
every
feather
and
a
diamond
solitaire
for
an
eye
and
in
the
evening
there
was
a
dance
and
she
appeared
in
a
gown
with
several
hundred
diamonds
sewn
upon
it
and
received
her
guests
upon
a
rug
set
with
jewels
to
match
all
together
montague
judged
this
the
fastest
set
he
had
yet
encountered
they
ate
more
and
drank
more
and
intrigued
more
openly
he
had
been
slowly
acquiring
the
special
lingo
of
society
but
these
people
had
so
much
more
slang
that
he
felt
all
lost
again
a
young
lady
who
was
gossiping
to
him
about
those
present
remarked
that
a
certain
youth
was
a
spasm
and
then
seeing
the
look
of
perplexity
upon
his
face
she
laughed
i
do
believe
you
know
what
i
mean
montague
replied
that
he
had
ventured
to
infer
that
she
did
not
like
him
and
then
there
was
harper
who
came
from
chicago
by
way
of
london
ten
years
ago
harper
had
overwhelmed
new
york
with
the
millions
brought
from
her
great
and
had
then
moved
on
sighing
for
new
worlds
to
conquer
when
she
had
left
chicago
her
grammar
had
been
unexceptionable
but
since
she
had
been
in
england
she
said
you
ai
and
dropped
all
her
g
and
when
montague
brought
down
a
bird
at
long
range
she
exclaimed
condescendingly
why
you
quite
a
dab
at
it
he
sat
in
the
front
seat
of
an
automobile
and
heard
the
great
lady
behind
him
referring
to
the
sturdy
jersey
farmers
whose
ancestors
had
fought
the
british
and
hessians
all
over
the
state
as
your
peasantry
it
was
an
extraordinary
privilege
to
have
harper
for
a
guest
at
home
she
moved
about
in
state
recalling
that
of
queen
victoria
with
flags
and
bunting
on
the
way
and
crowds
of
school
children
cheering
she
kept
up
half
a
dozen
establishments
and
had
a
hundred
thousand
acres
of
game
preserves
in
scotland
she
made
a
speciality
of
collecting
jewels
which
had
belonged
to
the
romantic
and
picturesque
queens
of
history
she
appeared
at
the
dance
in
a
breastplate
of
diamonds
covering
the
entire
front
of
her
bodice
so
that
she
was
literally
clothed
in
light
and
with
her
was
her
english
friend
percy
who
had
accompanied
her
in
her
triumph
through
the
courts
and
camps
of
europe
and
displayed
a
famous
containing
one
specimen
of
every
rare
and
beautiful
jewel
known
percy
wore
a
gown
of
cloth
of
gold
tissue
covered
with
a
fortune
in
venetian
lace
and
made
a
tremendous
sensation
until
the
rumour
spread
that
it
was
a
rehash
of
the
costume
which
harper
had
worn
at
the
duchess
of
london
ball
the
chicago
lady
herself
never
by
any
chance
appeared
in
the
same
costume
twice
alice
had
a
grand
time
at
the
todds
all
the
men
fell
in
love
with
her
one
in
particular
a
young
chap
named
fayette
quite
threw
himself
at
her
feet
he
was
wealthy
but
unfortunately
he
had
made
his
money
by
eloping
with
a
rich
girl
who
was
one
of
the
present
party
and
so
from
a
practical
point
of
view
his
attentions
were
not
desirable
for
alice
montague
was
left
with
the
task
of
finding
these
things
out
for
himself
for
his
brother
devoted
himself
exclusively
to
betty
wyman
the
way
these
two
disappeared
between
meals
was
a
jest
of
the
whole
company
so
that
when
they
were
on
their
way
home
montague
felt
called
upon
to
make
paternal
inquiries
we
as
much
engaged
as
we
dare
to
be
oliver
answered
him
and
when
do
you
expect
to
marry
her
god
knows
said
he
i
do
the
old
man
would
give
her
a
cent
and
you
could
support
her
i
good
heavens
allan
do
you
suppose
betty
would
consent
to
be
poor
have
you
asked
her
inquired
montague
i
do
want
to
ask
her
thank
you
i
not
the
least
desire
to
live
in
a
hovel
with
a
girl
who
been
brought
up
in
a
palace
then
what
do
you
expect
to
do
well
betty
has
a
rich
aunt
in
a
lunatic
asylum
and
then
i
making
money
you
know
and
the
old
boy
will
have
to
relent
in
the
end
and
we
having
a
very
good
time
in
the
meanwhile
you
know
you
ca
be
very
much
in
love
said
montague
to
which
his
brother
replied
cheerfully
that
they
were
as
much
in
love
as
they
felt
like
being
this
was
on
the
train
monday
morning
oliver
observed
that
his
brother
relapsed
into
a
brown
study
and
remarked
i
suppose
you
going
back
now
to
bury
yourself
in
your
books
you
got
to
give
me
one
evening
this
week
for
a
dinner
that
important
where
that
asked
the
other
oh
it
a
long
story
said
oliver
i
explain
it
to
you
some
time
but
first
we
must
have
an
understanding
about
next
week
also
i
suppose
you
not
overlooked
the
fact
that
it
christmas
week
and
you
wo
be
permitted
to
do
any
work
then
but
that
impossible
exclaimed
the
other
nothing
else
is
possible
said
oliver
firmly
i
made
an
engagement
for
you
with
the
eldridge
devons
up
the
hudson
for
the
whole
week
the
whole
week
and
it
be
the
most
important
thing
you
done
winnie
going
to
take
us
all
in
her
car
and
you
will
make
no
end
of
indispensable
acquaintances
oliver
i
do
see
how
in
the
world
i
can
do
it
the
other
protested
in
dismay
and
went
on
for
several
minutes
arguing
and
explaining
what
he
had
to
do
but
oliver
contented
himself
with
the
assurance
that
where
there
a
will
there
a
way
one
could
not
refuse
an
invitation
to
spend
christmas
with
the
eldridge
devons
and
sure
enough
there
was
a
way
hasbrook
had
mentioned
to
him
that
he
had
had
considerable
work
done
upon
the
case
and
would
have
the
papers
sent
round
and
when
montague
reached
his
office
that
morning
he
found
them
there
there
was
a
package
of
several
thousand
pages
and
upon
examining
them
he
found
to
his
utter
consternation
that
they
contained
a
complete
bill
of
complaint
with
all
the
necessary
references
and
citations
and
a
preliminary
draught
of
a
brief
in
short
a
complete
and
thoroughgoing
preparation
of
his
case
there
could
not
have
been
less
than
ten
or
fifteen
thousand
worth
of
work
in
the
papers
and
montague
sat
quite
aghast
turning
over
the
neatly
typewritten
sheets
he
could
indeed
afford
to
attend
christmas
house
parties
if
all
his
clients
were
to
treat
him
like
this
he
felt
a
little
piqued
about
it
for
he
had
noted
some
of
these
points
for
himself
and
felt
a
little
proud
about
them
apparently
he
was
to
be
nothing
but
a
in
the
case
and
he
turned
to
the
phone
and
called
up
hasbrook
and
asked
him
what
he
expected
him
to
do
with
these
papers
there
was
the
whole
case
here
and
was
he
simply
to
take
them
as
they
stood
no
one
could
have
replied
more
considerately
than
did
hasbrook
the
papers
were
for
montague
benefit
he
would
do
exactly
as
he
pleased
with
them
he
might
use
them
as
they
stood
or
reject
them
altogether
or
make
them
the
basis
for
his
own
work
anything
that
appealed
to
his
judgment
would
be
satisfactory
and
so
montague
turned
about
and
wrote
an
acceptance
to
the
formal
invitation
which
had
come
from
the
eldridge
devons
later
on
in
the
day
oliver
called
up
and
said
that
he
was
to
go
out
to
dinner
the
following
evening
and
that
he
would
call
for
him
at
eight
it
with
the
jack
evanses
oliver
added
do
you
know
them
montague
had
heard
the
name
as
that
of
the
president
of
a
chain
of
western
railroads
do
you
mean
him
he
asked
yes
said
the
other
they
a
rum
crowd
but
there
money
in
it
i
call
early
and
explain
it
to
you
but
it
was
explained
sooner
than
that
during
the
next
afternoon
montague
had
a
caller
none
other
than
winnie
duval
some
one
had
left
winnie
some
more
money
it
appeared
and
there
was
a
lot
of
red
tape
attached
to
it
which
she
wanted
the
new
lawyer
to
attend
to
also
she
said
she
hoped
that
he
would
charge
her
a
lot
of
money
by
way
of
encouraging
himself
it
was
a
mere
bagatelle
of
a
hundred
thousand
or
so
from
some
forgotten
aunt
in
the
west
the
business
was
soon
disposed
of
and
then
winnie
asked
montague
if
he
had
any
place
to
go
to
for
dinner
that
evening
which
was
the
occasion
of
his
mentioning
the
jack
evanses
o
dear
me
said
winnie
with
a
laugh
is
ollie
going
to
take
you
there
what
a
funny
time
you
have
do
you
know
them
asked
the
other
heavens
no
was
the
answer
nobody
knows
them
but
everybody
knows
about
them
my
husband
meets
old
evans
in
business
of
course
and
thinks
he
a
good
sort
but
the
family
dear
me
how
much
of
it
is
there
why
there
the
old
lady
and
two
grown
daughters
and
a
son
the
son
a
fine
chap
they
say
the
old
man
took
him
in
hand
and
put
him
at
work
in
the
shops
but
i
suppose
he
thought
that
daughters
were
too
much
of
a
proposition
for
him
and
so
he
sent
them
to
a
fancy
school
and
i
tell
you
they
the
most
highly
polished
human
specimens
that
ever
you
encountered
it
sounded
entertaining
but
what
does
oliver
want
with
them
asked
montague
wonderingly
it
is
that
he
wants
them
they
want
him
they
cumbers
you
know
perfectly
frantic
they
come
to
town
to
get
into
society
then
you
mean
that
they
pay
oliver
asked
montague
i
do
know
that
said
the
other
with
a
laugh
you
have
to
ask
ollie
they
a
number
of
the
little
brothers
of
the
rich
hanging
round
them
picking
up
whatever
plunder
in
sight
a
look
of
pain
crossed
montague
face
and
she
saw
it
and
put
out
her
hand
with
a
sudden
gesture
oh
she
exclaimed
i
offended
you
no
said
he
it
not
that
exactly
i
would
be
offended
but
worried
about
my
brother
how
do
you
mean
he
gets
a
lot
of
money
somehow
and
i
do
know
what
it
means
the
woman
sat
for
a
few
moments
in
silence
watching
him
did
he
have
any
when
he
came
here
she
asked
not
very
much
said
he
because
she
went
on
if
he
did
he
certainly
managed
it
very
cleverly
we
all
thought
he
had
again
there
was
a
pause
then
suddenly
winnie
said
do
you
know
you
feel
differently
about
money
from
the
way
we
do
in
new
york
do
you
realize
it
i
not
sure
said
he
how
do
you
mean
you
look
at
it
in
an
sort
of
way
a
person
has
to
earn
it
it
a
sign
of
something
he
done
it
came
to
me
just
now
all
in
a
flash
we
do
feel
that
way
about
money
we
have
any
of
us
earned
ours
we
just
got
it
and
it
never
occurs
to
us
to
expect
other
people
to
earn
it
all
we
want
to
know
is
if
they
have
it
montague
did
not
tell
his
companion
how
very
profound
a
remark
he
considered
that
he
was
afraid
it
would
not
be
delicate
to
agree
with
her
he
had
heard
a
story
of
a
negro
occupant
of
the
mourners
bench
who
was
voluble
in
confession
of
his
sins
but
took
exception
to
the
fervour
with
which
the
congregation
said
amen
the
evanses
used
to
be
a
lot
funnier
than
they
are
now
continued
winnie
after
a
while
when
they
came
here
last
year
they
were
really
frightful
they
had
an
english
chap
for
social
secretary
a
younger
son
of
some
old
family
my
brother
knew
a
man
who
had
been
one
of
their
intimates
in
the
west
and
he
said
it
was
perfectly
excruciating
this
fellow
used
to
sit
at
the
table
and
give
orders
to
the
whole
crowd
fork
should
be
at
your
right
hand
miss
one
never
asks
for
more
soup
master
and
miss
anna
always
move
your
from
you
that
better
i
fancy
i
shall
feel
sorry
for
them
said
montague
oh
you
need
said
the
other
promptly
they
get
what
they
want
do
you
think
so
why
certainly
they
will
they
got
the
money
and
they
been
abroad
they
learning
the
game
and
they
keep
at
it
until
they
succeed
what
else
is
there
for
them
to
do
and
then
my
husband
says
that
old
evans
is
making
himself
a
power
here
in
the
east
so
that
pretty
soon
they
wo
dare
offend
him
does
that
count
asked
the
man
well
i
guess
it
counts
laughed
winnie
it
has
of
late
and
she
went
on
to
tell
him
of
the
society
leader
who
had
dared
to
offend
the
daughters
of
a
great
magnate
and
how
the
magnate
had
retaliated
by
turning
the
woman
husband
out
of
his
high
office
that
was
often
the
way
in
the
business
world
the
struggles
were
supposed
to
be
affairs
of
men
but
oftener
than
not
the
moving
power
was
a
woman
intrigue
you
would
see
a
great
upheaval
in
wall
street
and
it
would
be
two
of
the
big
men
quarrelling
over
a
mistress
you
would
see
some
man
rush
suddenly
into
a
high
office
and
that
would
be
because
his
wife
had
sold
herself
to
advance
him
winnie
took
him
up
town
in
her
auto
and
he
dressed
for
dinner
and
then
came
oliver
and
his
brother
asked
are
you
trying
to
put
the
evanses
into
society
who
been
telling
you
about
them
asked
the
other
winnie
said
montague
what
did
she
tell
you
montague
went
over
her
recital
which
his
brother
apparently
found
satisfactory
it
not
as
serious
as
that
he
said
answering
the
earlier
question
i
help
them
a
little
now
and
then
what
do
you
do
oh
advise
them
mostly
tell
them
where
to
go
and
what
to
wear
when
they
first
came
to
new
york
they
were
dressed
like
paraquets
you
know
and
here
oliver
broke
into
a
laugh
i
refrain
from
making
jokes
about
them
and
when
i
hear
other
people
abusing
them
i
point
out
that
they
are
sure
to
land
in
the
end
and
will
be
dangerous
enemies
i
got
one
or
two
wedges
started
for
them
and
do
they
pay
you
for
doing
it
you
call
it
paying
me
i
suppose
replied
the
other
the
old
man
carries
a
few
shares
of
stock
for
me
now
and
then
carries
a
few
shares
echoed
montague
and
oliver
explained
the
procedure
this
was
one
of
the
customs
which
had
grown
up
in
a
community
where
people
did
not
have
to
earn
their
money
the
recipient
of
the
favour
put
up
nothing
and
took
no
risks
but
the
other
person
was
supposed
to
buy
some
stock
for
him
and
then
when
the
stock
went
up
he
would
send
a
cheque
for
the
profits
many
a
man
who
would
have
resented
a
direct
offer
of
money
would
assent
pleasantly
when
a
powerful
friend
offered
to
carry
a
hundred
shares
for
him
this
was
the
way
one
offered
a
tip
in
the
big
world
it
was
useful
in
the
case
of
newspaper
men
whose
good
opinion
of
a
stock
was
desired
or
of
politicians
and
legislators
whose
votes
might
help
its
fortunes
when
one
expected
to
get
into
society
one
must
be
prepared
to
strew
such
tips
about
him
of
course
added
oliver
what
the
family
would
really
like
me
to
do
is
to
get
the
robbie
wallings
to
take
them
up
i
suppose
i
could
get
round
half
a
million
of
them
if
i
could
manage
that
to
all
of
which
montague
replied
i
see
a
great
light
had
dawned
upon
him
so
that
was
the
way
it
was
managed
that
was
why
one
paid
thirty
thousand
a
year
for
one
apartments
and
thirty
thousand
more
for
a
girl
clothes
no
wonder
it
was
better
to
spend
christmas
week
at
the
eldridge
devons
than
to
labour
at
one
law
books
one
more
question
montague
went
on
why
are
you
introducing
me
to
them
well
his
brother
answered
it
wo
hurt
you
you
find
it
amusing
you
see
they
heard
i
had
a
brother
and
they
asked
me
to
bring
you
i
could
keep
you
hidden
for
ever
could
i
all
this
was
while
they
were
driving
up
town
the
evanses
place
was
on
riverside
drive
and
when
montague
got
out
of
the
cab
and
saw
it
looming
up
in
the
he
emitted
an
exclamation
of
wonder
it
was
as
big
as
a
jail
oh
yes
they
got
room
enough
said
oliver
with
a
laugh
i
put
this
deal
through
for
them
it
the
old
lamson
palace
you
know
they
had
the
room
and
likewise
they
had
all
the
trappings
of
snobbery
montague
took
that
fact
in
at
a
glance
there
were
and
scarlet
facings
and
gold
braid
marble
balconies
and
fireplaces
and
fountains
french
masters
and
real
flemish
tapestry
the
staircase
of
their
palace
was
a
winding
one
and
there
was
a
white
velvet
carpet
which
had
been
specially
woven
for
it
and
had
to
be
changed
frequently
at
the
top
of
it
was
a
white
cashmere
rug
which
had
a
pedigree
of
six
centuries
and
so
on
and
then
came
the
family
this
tall
gigantic
man
with
face
and
straggling
grey
moustache
this
was
jack
evans
and
evans
short
and
pudgy
but
with
a
kindly
face
and
not
too
many
diamonds
and
the
misses
evans
stately
and
slender
and
perfectly
arrayed
why
they
all
right
was
the
thought
that
came
to
montague
they
were
all
right
until
they
opened
their
mouths
when
they
spoke
you
discovered
that
evans
was
a
miner
and
that
his
wife
had
been
cook
on
a
ranch
also
that
anne
and
mary
had
harsh
voices
and
that
they
never
by
any
chance
said
or
did
anything
natural
they
were
escorted
into
the
stately
henri
with
a
historic
mantel
taken
from
the
palace
of
fontainebleau
and
four
great
allegorical
paintings
of
morning
evening
noon
and
midnight
upon
the
walls
there
were
no
other
guests
the
table
set
for
six
seemed
like
a
toy
in
the
vast
apartment
and
in
a
sudden
flash
with
a
start
of
almost
terror
montague
realized
what
it
must
mean
not
to
be
in
society
to
have
all
this
splendour
and
nobody
to
share
it
to
have
henri
ii
and
louis
xvi
parlours
and
louis
xiv
libraries
and
see
them
all
empty
to
have
no
one
to
drive
with
or
talk
with
no
one
to
visit
or
play
cards
with
to
go
to
the
theatre
and
the
opera
and
have
no
one
to
speak
to
worse
than
that
to
be
stared
at
and
smiled
at
to
live
in
this
huge
palace
and
know
that
all
the
horde
of
servants
underneath
their
cringing
deference
were
sneering
at
you
to
face
that
to
live
in
the
presence
of
it
day
after
day
and
then
outside
of
your
home
the
ever
widening
circles
of
ridicule
and
contempt
society
with
all
its
and
parasites
its
imitators
and
admirers
and
some
one
had
defied
all
that
some
one
had
taken
up
the
sword
and
gone
forth
to
beat
down
that
opposition
montague
looked
at
this
little
family
of
four
and
wondered
which
of
them
was
the
driving
force
in
this
most
desperate
emprise
he
arrived
at
it
by
a
process
of
elimination
it
could
not
be
evans
himself
one
saw
that
the
old
man
was
quite
hopeless
socially
nothing
could
change
his
big
hairy
hands
or
his
lean
scrawny
neck
or
his
irresistible
impulse
to
slide
down
in
his
chair
and
cross
his
long
legs
in
front
of
him
the
face
and
the
talk
of
jack
evans
brought
irresistibly
to
mind
the
mountain
trail
and
the
prospector
the
smoke
of
and
the
odour
of
bacon
and
beans
seventeen
long
years
the
man
had
tramped
in
deserts
and
mountain
wildernesses
and
nature
had
graven
her
impress
deep
into
his
body
and
soul
he
was
very
shy
at
this
dinner
but
montague
came
to
know
him
well
in
the
course
of
time
and
after
he
had
come
to
realize
that
montague
was
not
one
of
the
grafters
he
opened
up
his
heart
evans
had
held
on
to
his
mine
when
he
had
found
it
and
he
had
downed
the
rivals
who
had
tried
to
take
it
away
from
him
and
he
had
bought
the
railroads
who
had
tried
to
crush
him
and
now
he
had
come
to
wall
street
to
fight
the
men
who
had
tried
to
ruin
his
railroads
but
through
it
all
he
had
kept
the
heart
of
a
woman
and
the
sight
of
real
distress
was
unbearable
to
him
he
was
the
sort
of
man
to
keep
a
roll
of
bills
in
his
pistol
pocket
and
to
give
one
away
if
he
thought
he
could
do
it
without
offence
and
on
the
other
hand
men
told
how
once
when
he
had
seen
a
porter
insult
a
woman
passenger
on
his
line
he
jumped
up
and
pulled
the
and
had
the
man
put
out
on
the
roadside
at
midnight
thirty
miles
from
the
nearest
town
no
it
was
the
women
folks
he
said
to
montague
with
his
grim
laugh
it
did
trouble
him
at
all
to
be
called
a
noovoo
rich
and
when
he
felt
like
dancing
a
shakedown
he
could
take
a
run
out
to
country
but
the
women
folks
had
got
the
bee
in
their
bonnet
the
old
man
added
sadly
that
one
of
the
disadvantages
of
striking
it
rich
was
that
it
left
the
women
folks
with
nothing
to
do
nor
was
it
evans
either
sarey
as
she
was
called
by
the
head
of
the
house
sat
next
to
montague
at
dinner
and
he
discovered
that
with
the
very
least
encouragement
the
good
lady
was
willing
to
become
homelike
and
comfortable
montague
gave
the
occasion
because
he
was
a
stranger
and
volunteered
the
opinion
that
new
york
was
a
shamelessly
extravagant
place
and
hard
to
get
along
in
and
evans
took
up
the
subject
and
revealed
herself
as
a
and
kindly
personage
who
had
wistful
yearnings
for
mush
and
molasses
and
and
bread
fried
in
and
similar
sensible
things
while
her
chef
was
compelling
her
to
eat
de
foie
in
aspic
and
and
glacées
of
course
she
did
not
say
that
at
dinner
she
made
a
game
effort
to
play
her
part
with
the
result
of
at
least
one
diverting
experience
for
montague
evans
was
telling
him
what
a
dreadful
place
she
considered
the
city
for
young
men
and
how
she
feared
to
bring
her
boy
here
the
men
here
have
no
morals
at
all
said
she
and
added
earnestly
i
come
to
the
conclusion
that
eastern
men
are
naturally
amphibious
then
as
montague
knitted
his
brows
and
looked
perplexed
she
added
do
you
think
so
and
he
replied
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
that
he
had
never
really
thought
of
it
before
it
was
not
until
a
couple
of
hours
later
that
the
light
dawned
upon
him
in
the
course
of
a
conversation
with
miss
anne
we
met
lady
stonebridge
at
luncheon
said
that
young
person
do
you
know
her
no
said
montague
who
had
never
heard
of
her
i
think
those
aristocratic
english
women
use
the
most
abominable
slang
continued
anne
have
you
noticed
it
yes
i
have
he
said
and
so
utterly
cynical
do
you
know
lady
stonebridge
quite
shocked
mother
she
told
her
she
did
believe
in
marriage
at
all
and
that
she
thought
all
men
were
naturally
polygamous
later
on
montague
came
to
know
sarey
and
one
afternoon
sitting
in
her
petit
trianon
he
asked
her
abruptly
why
in
the
world
do
you
want
to
get
into
society
and
the
poor
lady
caught
her
breath
and
tried
to
be
indignant
and
then
seeing
that
he
was
in
earnest
and
that
she
was
cornered
broke
down
and
confessed
it
me
she
said
it
the
gals
for
along
with
the
surrender
went
a
reversion
to
natural
speech
it
mary
and
more
particularly
anne
they
talked
it
over
confidentially
which
was
a
great
relief
to
sarey
soul
for
she
was
cruelly
lonely
so
far
as
she
was
concerned
it
was
not
because
she
wanted
society
but
because
society
did
want
her
she
flashed
up
in
sudden
anger
and
clenched
her
fists
declaring
that
jack
evans
was
as
good
a
man
as
walked
the
streets
of
new
york
and
they
would
acknowledge
it
before
he
got
through
with
them
too
after
that
she
intended
to
settle
down
at
home
and
be
comfortable
and
mend
her
husband
socks
she
went
on
to
tell
him
what
a
hard
road
was
the
path
of
glory
there
were
hundreds
of
people
ready
to
know
them
but
oh
such
a
riffraff
they
might
fill
up
their
home
with
the
and
the
yellow
but
no
they
could
wait
they
had
learned
a
lot
since
they
set
out
one
very
aristocratic
lady
had
invited
them
to
dinner
and
their
hopes
had
been
high
but
alas
while
they
were
sitting
by
the
fireplace
some
one
admired
a
emerald
ring
which
evans
had
on
her
finger
and
she
had
taken
it
off
and
passed
it
about
among
the
company
and
somewhere
it
had
vanished
completely
and
another
person
had
invited
mary
to
a
and
though
she
had
played
hardly
at
all
her
hostess
had
quietly
informed
her
that
she
had
lost
a
thousand
dollars
and
the
great
lady
stonebridge
had
actually
sent
for
her
and
told
her
that
she
could
introduce
her
in
some
of
the
very
best
circles
if
only
she
was
willing
to
lose
always
evans
had
possessed
a
very
homely
irish
name
before
she
was
married
and
lady
stonebridge
had
got
five
thousand
dollars
from
her
to
use
some
great
influence
she
possessed
in
the
royal
college
of
heralds
and
prove
that
she
was
descended
directly
from
the
noble
old
family
of
magennis
who
had
been
the
lords
of
iveagh
way
back
in
the
fourteenth
century
and
now
oliver
had
told
them
that
this
imposing
charter
would
not
help
them
in
the
least
in
the
process
of
elimination
there
were
the
misses
evans
left
montague
friends
made
many
jests
when
they
heard
that
he
had
met
them
asking
him
if
he
meant
to
settle
down
major
venable
went
so
far
as
to
assure
him
that
there
was
not
the
least
doubt
that
either
of
the
girls
would
take
him
in
a
second
montague
laughed
and
answered
that
mary
was
not
so
bad
she
had
a
sweet
face
and
was
but
also
she
was
two
years
younger
than
anne
and
he
could
not
get
over
the
thought
that
two
more
years
might
make
another
anne
of
her
for
it
was
anne
who
was
the
driving
force
of
the
family
anne
who
had
planned
the
great
campaign
and
selected
the
lamson
palace
and
pried
the
family
loose
from
the
primeval
rocks
of
nevada
she
was
cold
as
an
iceberg
tireless
pitiless
to
others
as
to
herself
for
seventeen
years
her
father
had
wandered
and
dug
among
the
mountains
and
for
seventeen
years
if
need
be
she
would
dig
beneath
the
walls
of
the
fortress
of
society
after
montague
had
had
his
heart
to
heart
talk
with
the
mother
miss
anne
evans
became
very
haughty
toward
him
whereby
he
knew
that
the
old
lady
had
told
about
it
and
that
the
daughter
resented
his
presumption
but
to
oliver
she
laid
bare
her
soul
and
oliver
would
come
and
tell
his
brother
about
it
how
she
plotted
and
planned
and
studied
and
brought
new
schemes
to
him
every
week
she
had
some
of
the
real
people
bought
over
to
secret
sympathy
with
her
if
there
was
some
especial
favour
which
she
asked
for
she
would
set
to
work
with
the
old
man
and
the
person
would
have
some
important
money
service
done
him
she
had
the
people
of
society
all
marked
she
was
learning
all
their
weaknesses
and
the
underground
passages
of
their
lives
and
working
patiently
to
find
the
key
to
her
problem
some
one
family
which
was
socially
impregnable
but
whose
finances
were
in
such
a
shape
that
they
would
receive
the
proposition
to
take
up
the
evanses
and
definitely
put
them
in
montague
used
to
look
back
upon
all
this
with
wonder
and
amusement
from
those
days
in
the
not
far
distant
future
when
the
papers
had
cable
descriptions
of
the
gowns
of
the
duchess
of
arden
nee
evans
who
was
the
bright
particular
star
of
the
london
social
season
chapter
xiv
montague
had
written
a
reluctant
letter
to
major
thorne
telling
him
that
he
had
been
unable
to
interest
anyone
in
his
proposition
and
that
he
was
not
in
position
to
undertake
it
himself
then
according
to
his
brother
injunction
he
left
his
money
in
the
bank
and
waited
there
would
be
something
doing
soon
said
oliver
and
as
they
drove
home
from
the
evanses
oliver
served
notice
upon
him
that
this
event
might
be
expected
any
day
he
was
very
mysterious
about
it
and
would
answer
none
of
his
brother
questions
except
to
say
that
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
people
they
had
just
visited
i
suppose
montague
remarked
you
have
not
failed
to
realize
that
evans
might
play
you
false
and
the
other
laughed
echoing
the
words
might
do
it
then
he
went
on
to
tell
the
tale
of
the
great
railroad
builder
of
the
west
whose
daughter
had
been
married
with
elaborate
festivities
and
some
of
the
young
men
present
thinking
to
find
him
in
a
sentimental
mood
had
asked
him
for
his
views
about
the
market
he
advised
them
to
buy
the
stock
of
his
road
and
they
formed
a
pool
and
bought
and
as
fast
as
they
bought
he
sold
until
the
little
venture
cost
the
boys
a
total
of
seven
million
and
a
half
no
no
oliver
added
i
have
never
put
up
a
dollar
for
anything
of
evans
and
i
never
they
are
simply
a
side
issue
anyway
he
added
carelessly
a
couple
of
mornings
later
while
montague
was
at
breakfast
his
brother
called
him
up
and
said
that
he
was
coming
round
and
would
go
down
town
with
him
montague
knew
at
once
that
that
meant
something
serious
for
he
had
never
before
known
his
brother
to
be
awake
so
early
they
took
a
cab
and
then
oliver
explained
the
moment
had
arrived
the
time
to
take
the
plunge
and
come
up
with
a
fortune
he
could
not
tell
much
about
it
for
it
was
a
matter
upon
which
he
stood
pledged
to
absolute
secrecy
there
were
but
four
people
in
the
country
who
knew
about
it
it
was
the
chance
of
a
lifetime
and
in
four
or
five
hours
it
would
be
gone
three
times
before
it
had
come
to
oliver
and
each
time
he
had
multiplied
his
capital
several
times
that
he
had
not
made
millions
was
simply
because
he
did
not
have
enough
money
his
brother
must
take
his
word
for
this
and
simply
put
himself
into
his
hands
what
is
it
you
want
me
to
do
asked
montague
gravely
i
want
you
to
take
every
dollar
you
have
or
that
you
can
lay
your
hands
on
this
morning
and
turn
it
over
to
me
to
buy
stocks
with
to
buy
on
margin
you
mean
of
course
i
mean
that
said
oliver
then
as
he
saw
his
brother
frown
he
added
understand
me
i
have
absolutely
certain
information
as
to
how
a
certain
stock
will
behave
the
best
judges
of
a
stock
often
make
mistakes
in
such
matters
said
montague
it
is
not
a
question
of
any
person
judgment
was
the
reply
it
is
a
question
of
knowledge
the
stock
is
to
be
made
to
behave
so
but
how
can
you
know
that
the
person
who
intends
to
make
it
behave
may
not
be
lying
to
you
my
information
does
not
come
from
that
person
but
from
a
person
who
has
no
such
interest
who
on
the
contrary
is
in
on
the
deal
with
me
and
gains
only
as
i
gain
then
in
other
words
said
montague
your
information
is
stolen
everything
in
wall
street
is
stolen
was
oliver
concise
reply
there
was
a
long
silence
while
the
cab
rolled
swiftly
on
its
way
well
oliver
asked
at
last
i
can
imagine
said
montague
how
a
man
might
intend
to
move
a
certain
stock
and
think
that
he
had
the
power
and
yet
find
that
he
was
mistaken
there
are
so
many
forces
so
many
chances
to
be
considered
it
seems
to
me
you
must
be
taking
a
risk
oliver
laughed
you
talk
like
a
child
was
his
reply
suppose
that
i
were
in
absolute
control
of
a
corporation
and
that
i
chose
to
run
it
for
purposes
of
market
manipulation
do
you
think
i
might
come
pretty
near
knowing
what
its
stock
was
going
to
do
yes
said
montague
slowly
if
such
a
thing
as
that
were
conceivable
if
it
were
conceivable
laughed
his
brother
and
now
suppose
that
i
had
a
confidential
man
a
secretary
we
say
and
i
paid
him
twenty
thousand
a
year
and
he
saw
chances
to
make
a
hundred
thousand
in
an
hour
do
you
think
he
might
conceivably
try
it
yes
said
montague
he
might
but
where
do
you
come
in
well
if
the
man
were
going
to
do
anything
worth
while
he
need
capital
would
he
not
and
he
hardly
dare
to
look
for
any
money
in
the
street
where
a
thousand
eyes
would
be
watching
him
what
more
natural
than
to
look
out
for
some
person
who
is
in
society
and
has
the
ear
of
private
parties
with
plenty
of
cash
and
montague
sat
in
deep
thought
i
see
he
said
slowly
i
see
then
fixing
his
eyes
upon
oliver
he
exclaimed
earnestly
one
thing
more
do
ask
me
any
more
protested
the
other
i
told
you
i
was
pledged
you
must
tell
me
this
said
montague
does
bobbie
walling
know
about
it
he
does
not
was
the
reply
but
montague
had
known
his
brother
long
and
intimately
and
he
could
read
things
in
his
eyes
he
knew
that
that
was
a
lie
he
had
solved
the
mystery
at
last
montague
knew
that
he
had
come
to
a
parting
of
the
ways
he
did
not
like
this
kind
of
thing
he
had
not
come
to
new
york
to
be
a
but
what
a
difficult
thing
it
would
be
to
say
so
and
how
unfair
it
was
to
be
confronted
with
such
an
issue
and
compelled
to
decide
in
a
few
minutes
in
a
cab
he
had
put
himself
in
his
brother
hands
and
now
he
was
under
obligations
to
him
which
he
could
not
pay
off
oliver
had
paid
all
his
expenses
he
was
doing
everything
for
him
he
had
made
all
his
difficulties
his
own
and
all
in
frankness
and
perfect
trust
upon
the
assumption
that
his
brother
would
play
the
game
with
him
and
now
at
the
critical
moment
he
was
to
face
about
and
say
i
do
not
like
the
game
i
do
not
approve
of
your
life
such
a
painful
thing
it
is
to
have
a
higher
moral
code
than
one
friends
if
he
refused
he
saw
that
he
would
have
to
face
a
complete
break
he
could
not
go
on
living
in
the
world
to
which
he
had
been
introduced
fifty
thousand
had
seemed
an
enormous
fee
yet
even
a
week
or
two
had
sufficed
for
it
to
come
to
seem
inadequate
he
would
have
to
have
many
such
fees
if
they
were
to
go
on
living
at
their
present
rate
and
if
alice
were
to
have
a
social
career
and
entertain
her
friends
and
to
ask
alice
to
give
up
now
and
retire
would
be
even
harder
than
to
face
his
brother
here
in
the
cab
then
came
the
temptation
life
was
a
battle
and
this
was
the
way
it
was
being
fought
if
he
rejected
the
opportunity
others
would
seize
it
in
fact
by
refusing
he
would
be
handing
it
to
them
this
great
man
whoever
he
might
be
who
was
manipulating
stocks
for
his
own
convenience
could
anyone
in
his
senses
reject
a
chance
to
wrench
from
him
some
part
of
his
spoils
montague
saw
the
impulse
of
refusal
dying
away
within
him
well
asked
his
brother
finally
oliver
said
the
other
do
you
think
that
i
ought
to
know
more
about
it
so
that
i
can
judge
you
could
not
judge
even
if
i
told
you
all
said
oliver
it
would
take
you
a
long
time
to
become
familiar
with
the
circumstances
as
i
am
you
must
take
my
word
i
know
it
is
certain
and
safe
then
suddenly
he
unbuttoned
his
coat
and
took
out
some
papers
and
handed
his
brother
a
telegram
it
was
dated
chicago
and
read
guest
is
expected
henry
that
means
transcontinental
this
morning
said
oliver
i
see
said
the
other
then
the
man
is
in
chicago
no
was
the
reply
that
is
his
wife
he
wires
to
her
how
much
money
have
you
asked
oliver
after
a
pause
i
most
of
the
fifty
thousand
the
other
answered
and
about
thirty
thousand
we
brought
with
us
how
much
can
you
put
your
hands
on
why
i
could
get
all
of
it
but
part
of
the
money
is
mother
and
i
would
not
touch
that
the
younger
man
was
about
to
remonstrate
but
montague
stopped
him
i
will
put
up
the
fifty
thousand
i
have
earned
he
said
i
dare
not
risk
any
more
oliver
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
you
please
he
said
you
may
never
have
another
such
chance
in
your
life
he
dropped
the
subject
or
at
least
he
probably
tried
to
within
a
few
minutes
however
he
was
back
at
it
again
with
the
result
that
by
the
time
they
reached
the
montague
had
agreed
to
draw
sixty
thousand
they
stopped
at
his
bank
it
is
open
yet
said
oliver
but
the
paying
teller
will
oblige
you
tell
him
you
want
it
before
the
exchange
opens
montague
went
in
and
got
his
money
in
six
new
crisp
bills
he
buttoned
them
up
in
his
inmost
pocket
wondering
a
little
incidentally
at
the
magnificence
of
the
place
and
at
the
swift
routine
manner
in
which
the
clerk
took
in
and
paid
out
such
sums
as
this
then
they
drove
to
oliver
bank
and
he
drew
a
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
and
then
he
paid
off
the
cab
and
they
strolled
down
broadway
into
wall
street
it
lacked
a
quarter
of
an
hour
of
the
time
of
the
opening
of
the
exchange
and
a
stream
of
men
were
pouring
in
from
all
the
cars
and
ferries
to
their
offices
where
are
your
brokers
montague
inquired
i
do
have
any
brokers
at
least
not
for
a
matter
such
as
this
said
oliver
and
he
stopped
in
front
of
one
of
the
big
buildings
in
there
he
said
are
the
offices
of
hammond
and
streeter
second
floor
to
your
left
go
there
and
ask
for
a
member
of
the
firm
and
introduce
yourself
under
an
assumed
name
what
gasped
montague
of
course
man
you
would
not
dream
of
giving
your
own
name
what
difference
will
that
make
i
never
thought
of
doing
such
a
thing
said
the
other
well
think
of
it
now
but
montague
shook
his
head
i
would
not
do
that
he
said
oliver
shrugged
his
shoulders
all
right
he
said
tell
him
you
do
care
to
give
your
name
they
a
little
shady
they
take
your
money
suppose
they
wo
asked
the
other
then
wait
outside
for
me
and
i
take
you
somewhere
else
what
shall
i
buy
ten
thousand
shares
of
transcontinental
common
at
the
opening
price
and
tell
them
to
buy
on
the
scale
up
and
to
raise
the
stop
also
to
take
your
orders
to
sell
over
the
then
wait
there
until
i
come
for
you
montague
set
his
teeth
together
and
obeyed
orders
inside
the
door
marked
hammond
and
streeter
a
young
man
advanced
to
meet
him
and
led
him
to
a
and
affable
gentleman
streeter
and
montague
introduced
himself
as
a
stranger
in
town
from
the
south
and
wishing
to
buy
some
stock
streeter
led
him
into
an
inner
office
and
seated
himself
at
a
desk
and
drew
some
papers
in
front
of
him
your
name
please
he
asked
i
do
care
to
give
my
name
replied
the
other
and
streeter
put
down
his
pen
not
give
your
name
he
said
no
said
montague
quietly
why
said
streeter
i
do
understand
i
am
a
stranger
in
town
said
montague
and
not
accustomed
to
dealing
in
stocks
i
should
prefer
to
remain
unknown
the
man
eyed
him
sharply
where
do
you
come
from
he
asked
from
mississippi
was
the
reply
and
have
you
a
residence
in
new
york
at
a
hotel
said
montague
you
have
to
give
some
name
said
the
other
any
will
do
said
montague
john
smith
if
you
like
we
never
do
anything
like
this
said
the
broker
we
require
that
our
customers
be
introduced
there
are
rules
of
the
exchange
there
are
rules
i
am
sorry
said
montague
this
would
be
a
cash
transaction
how
many
shares
do
you
want
to
buy
ten
thousand
was
the
reply
streeter
became
more
serious
that
is
a
large
order
he
said
montague
said
nothing
what
do
you
wish
to
buy
was
the
next
question
transcontinental
common
he
replied
well
said
the
other
after
another
we
will
try
to
accommodate
you
but
you
will
have
to
consider
it
er
strictly
confidential
said
montague
so
streeter
made
out
the
papers
and
montague
looking
them
over
discovered
that
they
called
for
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
that
is
a
mistake
he
said
i
have
only
sixty
thousand
oh
said
the
other
we
shall
certainly
have
to
charge
you
a
ten
per
cent
margin
montague
was
not
prepared
for
this
contingency
but
he
did
some
mental
arithmetic
what
is
the
present
price
of
the
stock
he
asked
and
was
the
reply
then
sixty
thousand
dollars
is
more
than
ten
per
cent
of
the
market
price
said
montague
yes
said
streeter
but
in
dealing
with
a
stranger
we
shall
certainly
have
to
put
a
loss
order
at
four
points
above
and
that
would
leave
you
only
two
points
of
safety
surely
not
enough
i
see
said
montague
and
he
had
a
sudden
appalling
realization
of
the
wild
game
which
his
brother
had
planned
for
him
whereas
streeter
continued
persuasively
if
you
put
up
ten
per
you
will
have
six
points
very
well
said
the
other
promptly
then
please
buy
me
six
thousand
shares
so
they
closed
the
deal
and
the
papers
were
signed
and
streeter
took
the
six
new
crisp
bills
then
he
escorted
him
to
the
outer
office
remarking
pleasantly
on
the
way
i
hope
you
well
advised
we
inclined
to
be
bearish
upon
transcontinental
ourselves
the
situation
looks
rather
squally
these
words
were
not
worth
the
breath
it
took
to
say
them
but
montague
was
not
aware
of
this
and
felt
a
painful
start
within
but
he
answered
carelessly
that
one
must
take
his
chance
and
sat
down
in
one
of
the
customer
chairs
hammond
and
streeter
was
like
a
little
with
rows
of
seats
and
a
big
blackboard
in
front
with
the
initials
of
the
most
important
stocks
in
columns
and
closing
prices
above
on
little
green
cards
at
one
side
was
a
ticker
with
two
attendants
awaiting
the
opening
click
in
the
seats
were
twenty
or
thirty
men
old
and
young
most
of
them
regular
habitues
victims
of
the
fever
of
the
street
montague
watched
them
catching
snatches
of
their
whispered
conversation
with
its
intricate
and
disagreeable
slang
he
felt
intensely
humiliated
and
uncomfortable
for
he
had
got
the
fever
of
the
street
into
his
own
veins
and
he
could
not
conquer
it
there
were
nasty
shivers
running
up
and
down
his
spine
and
his
hands
were
cold
he
stared
at
the
little
figures
fascinated
they
stood
for
some
vast
and
tremendous
force
outside
which
could
not
be
controlled
or
even
comprehended
some
merciless
annihilating
force
like
the
lightning
or
the
tornado
and
he
had
put
himself
at
the
mercy
of
it
it
might
do
its
will
with
him
tr
read
the
little
pasteboard
and
he
had
only
six
points
of
safety
if
at
any
time
in
the
day
that
figure
should
be
changed
to
read
then
every
dollar
of
sixty
thousand
would
be
gone
for
ever
the
great
fee
that
he
had
worked
so
hard
for
and
rejoiced
so
greatly
over
that
would
be
all
gone
and
a
slice
out
of
his
inheritance
besides
a
boy
put
into
his
hand
a
little
paper
one
of
the
countless
which
different
houses
and
interests
distributed
free
for
advertising
or
other
purposes
and
a
heading
transcontinental
caught
his
eye
among
the
paragraphs
in
the
day
events
he
read
the
directors
meeting
of
the
transcontinental
will
be
held
at
noon
it
is
confidently
predicted
that
the
quarterly
dividend
will
be
passed
as
it
has
been
for
the
last
three
quarters
there
is
great
dissatisfaction
among
the
the
stock
has
been
decidedly
weak
with
no
apparent
inside
support
it
fell
off
three
points
just
before
closing
yesterday
upon
the
news
of
further
proceedings
by
western
state
officials
and
widely
credited
rumours
of
dissensions
among
the
directors
with
renewed
opposition
to
the
control
of
the
hopkins
interests
ten
came
and
went
and
the
ticker
began
its
long
journey
there
was
intense
activity
in
transcontinental
many
thousands
of
shares
changing
hands
and
the
price
swaying
back
and
forth
when
oliver
came
in
in
half
an
hour
it
stood
at
that
all
right
said
he
our
time
will
not
come
till
afternoon
but
suppose
we
are
wiped
out
before
afternoon
said
the
other
that
is
impossible
answered
oliver
there
will
be
big
buying
all
the
morning
they
sat
for
a
while
nervous
and
restless
then
by
way
of
breaking
the
monotony
oliver
suggested
that
his
brother
might
like
to
see
the
street
they
went
around
the
corner
to
broad
street
here
at
the
head
stood
the
building
with
all
the
gold
of
the
government
inside
and
a
gatling
gun
in
the
tower
the
public
did
not
know
it
was
there
but
the
financial
men
knew
it
and
it
seemed
as
if
they
had
huddled
all
their
offices
and
banks
and
vaults
under
its
shelter
here
far
underground
were
hidden
the
two
hundred
millions
of
securities
of
the
oil
trust
in
a
huge
steel
vault
with
a
door
so
delicately
poised
that
a
finger
could
swing
it
on
its
hinges
and
opposite
to
this
was
the
white
grecian
building
of
the
stock
exchange
down
the
street
were
throngs
of
men
within
a
roped
arena
pushing
shouting
jostling
this
was
the
curb
where
one
could
buy
or
sell
small
blocks
of
stock
and
all
the
mining
and
oil
stocks
which
were
not
listed
by
the
exchange
rain
or
shine
these
men
were
always
here
and
in
the
windows
of
the
neighbouring
buildings
stood
others
shouting
quotations
to
them
through
megaphones
or
signalling
in
deaf
and
dumb
language
some
of
these
brokers
wore
coloured
hats
so
that
they
could
be
distinguished
some
had
offices
far
off
where
men
sat
all
day
with
strong
glasses
trained
upon
them
everywhere
was
the
atmosphere
of
speculation
the
restless
feverish
eyes
the
quick
nervous
gestures
the
haggard
faces
for
in
this
game
every
man
was
pitted
against
every
other
man
and
the
dice
were
loaded
so
that
nine
out
of
every
ten
were
doomed
in
advance
to
ruin
and
defeat
they
procured
passes
to
the
visitors
gallery
of
the
exchange
from
here
one
looked
down
into
a
room
one
or
two
hundred
feet
square
its
floor
covered
with
a
snowstorm
of
torn
pieces
of
paper
and
its
air
a
babel
of
shouts
and
cries
here
were
gathered
perhaps
two
thousand
men
and
boys
some
were
lounging
and
talking
but
most
were
crowded
about
the
various
pushing
climbing
over
each
other
leaping
up
waving
their
hands
and
calling
aloud
a
seat
in
this
exchange
was
worth
about
thousand
dollars
and
so
no
one
of
these
men
was
poor
but
yet
they
came
day
after
day
to
play
their
parts
in
this
sordid
arena
seeking
in
sorrow
for
each
joy
inventing
a
thousand
petty
tricks
to
outwit
and
deceive
each
other
rejoicing
in
a
thousand
petty
triumphs
and
spending
their
lives
like
the
waves
upon
the
shore
a
very
symbol
of
human
futility
now
and
then
a
sudden
impulse
would
seize
them
and
they
would
become
like
howling
demons
surging
about
one
spot
shrieking
gasping
clawing
each
other
clothing
to
pieces
and
the
spectator
shuddered
seeing
them
as
the
victims
of
some
strange
and
dreadful
enchantment
which
bound
them
to
struggle
and
torment
each
other
until
they
were
worn
out
and
grey
but
one
felt
these
things
only
dimly
when
he
had
put
all
his
fortune
into
transcontinental
common
for
then
he
had
sold
his
own
soul
to
the
enchanter
and
the
spell
was
upon
him
and
he
hoped
and
feared
and
agonized
with
the
struggling
throng
montague
had
no
need
to
ask
which
was
his
post
for
a
mob
of
a
hundred
men
were
packed
about
it
with
little
whirls
and
eddies
here
and
there
on
the
outside
something
doing
all
right
said
a
man
in
his
ear
it
was
interesting
to
watch
but
there
was
one
difficulty
there
were
no
quotations
provided
for
the
spectators
so
the
sight
of
this
activity
merely
set
them
on
edge
with
anxiety
something
must
be
happening
to
their
stock
even
oliver
was
visibly
nervous
after
all
in
the
surest
cases
the
game
was
a
dangerous
one
there
might
be
a
big
failure
or
an
assassination
or
an
earthquake
they
rushed
out
and
made
for
the
nearest
broker
office
where
a
glance
at
the
board
showed
them
transcontinental
at
they
drew
a
long
breath
and
sat
down
again
to
wait
that
was
about
eleven
at
a
quarter
to
twelve
the
stock
went
up
an
eighth
and
then
a
quarter
and
then
another
eighth
the
two
gripped
their
hands
in
excitement
had
the
time
come
apparently
it
had
a
minute
later
the
stock
leaped
to
on
large
buying
then
it
went
more
a
buzz
of
excitement
ran
through
the
office
and
the
sat
up
in
their
seats
the
stock
went
another
quarter
montague
heard
a
man
behind
him
say
to
his
neighbour
what
does
it
mean
god
knows
was
the
answer
but
oliver
whispered
in
his
brother
ear
i
know
what
it
means
the
insiders
are
buying
somebody
was
buying
and
buying
furiously
the
ticker
seemed
to
set
all
other
business
aside
and
give
its
attention
to
the
trading
in
transcontinental
it
was
like
a
game
when
one
side
begins
to
pile
up
runs
and
the
man
in
the
coacher
box
chants
exultantly
and
the
dullest
spectator
is
stirred
since
no
man
can
be
indifferent
to
success
and
as
the
stock
went
higher
and
higher
a
little
wave
of
excitement
mounted
with
it
a
murmur
running
through
the
room
and
a
thrill
passing
from
person
to
person
some
watched
wondering
if
it
would
last
and
if
they
had
not
better
take
on
a
little
then
another
point
would
be
scored
and
they
would
wish
they
had
done
it
and
hesitate
whether
to
do
it
now
but
to
others
like
the
montagues
who
had
some
it
was
victory
glorious
and
thrilling
their
pulses
leaped
faster
with
every
new
change
of
the
figures
and
between
times
they
reckoned
up
their
gains
and
hung
between
hope
and
dread
for
the
new
gains
which
were
on
the
way
but
not
yet
in
sight
there
was
little
lull
and
the
boys
who
tended
the
board
had
a
chance
to
rest
the
stock
was
above
at
which
price
owing
to
the
device
of
pyramiding
montague
was
on
velvet
to
use
the
picturesque
phrase
of
the
street
his
earnings
amounted
to
sixty
thousand
dollars
and
even
if
the
stock
were
to
fall
and
he
were
to
be
sold
out
he
would
lose
nothing
he
wished
to
sell
and
realize
his
profits
but
his
brother
gripped
him
fast
by
the
arm
no
no
he
said
it
has
really
come
yet
some
went
out
to
lunch
to
a
restaurant
where
they
could
have
a
telephone
on
their
table
so
as
to
keep
in
touch
with
events
but
the
montagues
had
no
care
about
eating
they
sat
picturing
the
directors
in
session
and
speculating
upon
a
score
of
various
eventualities
things
might
yet
go
wrong
and
all
their
profits
would
vanish
like
early
and
all
their
capital
with
them
oliver
shook
like
a
leaf
but
he
would
not
stir
stay
game
he
whispered
he
took
out
his
watch
and
glanced
at
it
it
was
after
two
it
may
go
over
till
he
but
then
suddenly
came
the
storm
the
ticker
recorded
a
rise
in
the
price
of
transcontinental
of
a
point
and
a
half
upon
a
purchase
of
five
thousand
shares
and
then
half
a
point
for
two
thousand
more
after
that
it
never
stopped
it
went
a
point
at
a
time
it
went
ten
points
in
about
fifteen
minutes
and
babel
broke
loose
in
the
office
and
in
several
thousand
other
offices
in
the
street
and
spread
to
others
all
over
the
world
montague
had
got
up
and
was
moving
here
and
there
because
the
tension
was
unendurable
and
at
the
door
of
an
inner
office
he
heard
some
one
at
the
telephone
exclaiming
for
the
love
of
god
ca
you
find
out
what
the
matter
a
moment
later
a
man
rushed
in
breathless
and
and
his
voice
rang
through
the
office
the
directors
have
declared
a
quarterly
dividend
of
three
per
cent
and
an
extra
dividend
of
two
and
oliver
caught
his
brother
by
the
arm
and
started
for
the
door
with
him
get
to
your
broker
he
said
and
if
the
stock
has
stopped
moving
sell
and
sell
in
any
case
before
the
close
and
then
he
dashed
away
to
his
own
headquarters
at
about
half
after
three
oliver
came
into
hammond
and
streeter
breathless
and
with
his
hair
and
clothing
dishevelled
he
was
half
beside
himself
with
exultation
and
montague
was
scarcely
less
wrought
up
in
fact
he
felt
quite
limp
after
the
strain
he
had
been
through
what
price
did
you
get
his
brother
inquired
and
he
answered
an
average
of
there
had
been
another
sharp
rise
at
the
end
and
he
had
sold
all
his
stock
without
checking
the
advance
i
got
said
oliver
o
ye
gods
there
were
some
unhappy
shorts
in
the
office
streeter
was
one
of
them
it
was
bitterness
and
gall
to
them
to
see
the
radiant
faces
of
the
two
lucky
ones
but
the
two
did
not
even
see
this
they
went
out
half
dancing
and
had
a
drink
or
two
to
steady
their
nerves
they
would
not
actually
get
their
money
until
the
morrow
but
montague
figured
a
profit
of
a
trifle
under
a
quarter
of
a
million
for
himself
of
this
about
twenty
thousand
would
go
to
make
up
the
share
of
his
unknown
informant
the
balance
he
considered
would
be
an
ample
reward
for
his
six
hours
work
that
day
his
brother
had
won
more
than
twice
as
much
but
as
they
drove
up
home
talking
over
it
in
whispers
and
pledging
themselves
to
absolute
secrecy
oliver
suddenly
clenched
his
fist
and
struck
his
knee
by
god
he
exclaimed
if
i
had
been
a
fool
and
tried
to
save
an
extra
margin
i
could
have
had
a
million
chapter
xv
after
such
a
victory
one
felt
in
a
mood
for
christmas
festivities
for
music
and
dancing
and
all
beautiful
and
happy
things
such
a
thing
for
instance
as
winnie
when
she
came
to
meet
him
clad
in
her
best
automobile
coat
a
thing
of
purest
snowy
ermine
so
truly
gorgeous
that
wherever
she
went
people
turned
and
stared
and
caught
their
breath
winnie
was
a
picture
of
joyful
health
with
a
glow
in
her
rich
complexion
and
a
sparkle
in
her
black
eyes
she
sat
in
her
big
in
which
one
could
afford
to
wear
ermine
it
was
a
little
private
hotel
in
the
limousine
were
seats
for
six
persons
with
revolving
easy
chairs
and
berths
for
sleeping
and
a
and
a
and
a
beautiful
electric
chandelier
to
light
it
at
night
its
trimmings
were
of
south
american
mahogany
and
its
upholstering
of
spanish
and
morocco
leathers
it
had
a
telephone
with
which
one
spoke
to
the
driver
an
and
a
lunch
hamper
in
fact
one
might
have
spent
an
hour
discovering
new
gimcracks
in
this
magic
automobile
it
had
been
made
especially
for
winnie
a
couple
of
years
ago
and
the
newspapers
said
it
had
cost
thirty
thousand
dollars
it
had
then
been
quite
a
novelty
but
now
everybody
was
getting
them
in
this
car
one
might
sit
at
ease
and
laugh
and
chat
and
travel
at
the
rate
of
an
express
train
and
with
never
a
jar
or
a
quiver
nor
the
faintest
sound
of
any
sort
the
streets
of
the
city
sped
by
them
as
if
by
enchantment
they
went
through
the
park
and
out
riverside
drive
and
up
the
which
runs
out
of
broadway
all
the
way
to
albany
it
was
a
macadamized
avenue
lined
with
beautiful
and
stately
homes
as
one
went
farther
yet
he
came
to
the
great
country
whole
district
of
hundreds
of
square
miles
given
up
to
them
there
were
forests
and
lakes
and
streams
there
were
gardens
and
greenhouses
filled
with
rare
plants
and
flowers
and
parks
with
deer
browsing
and
peacocks
and
strutting
about
the
road
wound
in
and
out
among
hills
the
surfaces
of
which
would
be
one
unbroken
lawn
and
upon
the
highest
points
stood
palaces
of
every
conceivable
style
and
shape
one
might
find
these
great
domains
anywhere
around
the
city
at
a
distance
of
from
thirty
to
sixty
miles
there
were
two
or
three
hundred
of
them
and
incredible
were
the
sums
of
money
which
had
been
spent
upon
their
decoration
one
saw
an
artificial
lake
of
ten
thousand
acres
made
upon
land
which
had
cost
several
hundred
dollars
an
acre
one
saw
gardens
with
ten
thousand
and
a
quarter
of
a
million
dollars
worth
of
lilies
from
japan
there
was
one
estate
in
which
had
been
planted
a
million
dollars
worth
of
rare
trees
imported
from
all
over
the
world
some
rich
men
who
had
nothing
else
to
amuse
them
would
make
their
estates
over
and
over
again
changing
the
view
about
their
homes
as
one
changes
the
scenery
in
a
play
over
in
new
jersey
the
hegans
were
building
a
castle
upon
a
and
had
built
a
special
railroad
simply
to
carry
the
materials
here
also
was
the
estate
of
the
tobacco
king
upon
which
three
million
dollars
had
been
spent
before
the
plans
of
the
mansion
had
even
been
drawn
there
were
artificial
lakes
and
streams
and
fantastic
bridges
and
statuary
and
scores
of
little
model
plantations
and
estates
according
to
the
whim
of
the
owner
and
here
in
the
pocantico
hills
was
the
estate
of
the
oil
king
about
four
square
miles
with
thirty
miles
of
model
driveways
many
of
rare
plants
had
been
imported
for
its
gardens
and
it
took
six
hundred
men
to
keep
it
in
order
there
was
a
golf
course
a
little
miniature
alps
upon
which
the
richest
man
in
the
world
pursued
his
lost
health
with
armed
guards
and
detectives
patrolling
the
place
all
day
and
a
tower
with
a
whereby
at
night
he
could
flood
the
grounds
with
light
by
pressing
a
button
in
one
of
these
places
lived
the
heir
of
the
great
house
of
devon
his
cousin
dwelt
in
europe
saying
that
america
was
not
a
fit
place
for
a
gentleman
to
live
in
each
of
them
owned
a
hundred
million
worth
of
new
york
real
estate
and
drew
their
tribute
of
rents
from
the
toil
of
the
swarming
millions
of
the
city
and
always
according
to
the
policy
of
the
family
they
bought
new
real
estate
they
were
directors
of
the
great
railroads
tributary
to
the
city
and
in
touch
with
the
political
machines
and
in
every
other
way
in
position
to
know
what
was
under
way
if
a
new
subway
were
built
to
set
the
swarming
millions
free
the
millions
would
find
the
land
all
taken
up
and
newly
built
for
them
and
the
devons
were
the
owners
they
had
a
score
of
the
city
greatest
hotels
and
also
slum
tenements
and
brothels
and
dives
in
the
tenderloin
they
did
not
even
have
to
know
what
they
owned
they
did
not
have
to
know
anything
or
do
anything
they
lived
in
their
palaces
at
home
or
abroad
and
in
their
offices
in
the
city
the
great
machine
ground
on
eldridge
devon
occupation
was
playing
with
his
and
his
automobiles
he
had
recently
sold
all
his
horses
and
turned
his
stables
into
a
garage
equipped
with
a
score
or
so
of
cars
he
was
always
getting
a
new
one
and
discussing
its
merits
as
to
hudson
cliff
the
estate
he
had
conceived
the
brilliant
idea
of
establishing
a
gentleman
which
should
be
that
is
to
say
which
should
furnish
the
luxuries
and
necessities
of
its
table
for
no
more
than
it
would
have
cost
to
buy
them
considering
the
prices
usually
paid
this
was
no
astonishing
feat
but
devon
took
a
child
delight
in
it
he
showed
montague
his
greenhouses
filled
with
rare
flowers
and
fruits
and
his
model
dairy
with
marble
stables
and
nickel
plumbing
and
attendants
in
white
uniforms
and
rubber
gloves
he
was
a
short
and
very
stout
gentleman
with
red
cheeks
and
his
conversation
was
not
brilliant
to
hudson
cliff
came
many
of
montague
earlier
acquaintances
and
others
whom
he
had
not
met
before
they
amused
themselves
in
all
the
ways
with
had
become
familiar
at
likewise
on
christmas
eve
there
were
festivities
for
the
children
and
on
christmas
night
a
costume
ball
very
beautiful
and
stately
many
came
from
new
york
to
attend
this
and
others
from
the
neighbourhood
and
in
returning
calls
montague
saw
others
of
these
mansions
also
and
most
important
of
all
they
played
bridge
as
they
had
played
at
every
function
which
he
had
attended
so
far
here
winnie
who
had
rather
taken
him
up
and
threatened
to
supplant
oliver
as
his
social
guide
and
chaperon
insisted
that
no
more
excuses
would
be
accepted
and
so
for
two
mornings
he
sat
with
her
in
one
of
the
and
diligently
put
his
mind
upon
the
game
as
he
proved
an
apt
pupil
he
was
then
advised
that
he
might
take
a
trial
plunge
and
so
montague
came
into
touch
with
a
new
social
phenomenon
perhaps
on
the
whole
the
most
significant
and
phenomenon
which
society
had
exhibited
to
him
he
had
just
had
the
experience
of
getting
a
great
deal
of
money
without
earning
it
and
was
fresh
from
the
disagreeable
memories
of
it
the
trembling
and
suspense
the
burning
lustful
greed
the
terrible
excitement
he
had
hoped
that
he
would
not
soon
have
to
go
through
such
an
experience
here
was
the
prospect
of
an
endless
dalliance
with
it
for
that
was
the
meaning
of
bridge
it
was
a
penalty
which
people
were
paying
for
getting
their
money
without
earning
it
the
disease
got
into
their
blood
and
they
could
no
longer
live
without
the
excitement
of
gain
and
the
hope
of
gain
so
after
their
labours
were
over
when
they
were
supposed
to
be
resting
and
enjoying
themselves
they
would
get
together
and
torment
themselves
with
an
imitation
struggle
mimicking
the
grim
and
dreadful
gamble
of
business
down
in
the
street
oliver
had
pointed
out
to
his
brother
a
celebrated
plunger
who
had
sometimes
won
six
or
eight
millions
in
a
single
day
and
that
man
would
play
at
stocks
all
morning
and
play
the
ponies
in
the
afternoon
and
then
spend
the
evening
in
a
millionaires
and
so
it
was
with
the
bridge
fiends
it
was
a
social
plague
it
had
run
through
all
society
high
and
low
it
had
destroyed
conversation
and
all
it
would
end
by
destroying
even
common
decency
and
turning
the
best
people
into
vulgar
thus
spoke
billy
alden
who
was
one
of
the
guests
and
montague
thought
that
billy
ought
to
know
for
she
herself
was
playing
all
the
time
billy
did
not
like
winnie
duval
and
the
beginning
of
the
conversation
was
her
inquiry
why
he
let
that
woman
corrupt
him
then
the
good
lady
went
on
to
tell
him
what
bridge
had
come
to
be
how
people
played
it
on
the
trains
all
the
way
from
new
york
to
san
francisco
how
they
had
tables
in
their
autos
and
played
while
they
were
touring
over
the
world
once
said
she
i
took
a
party
to
see
the
america
cup
races
off
sandy
hook
and
when
we
got
back
to
the
pier
some
one
called
won
and
the
answer
was
ahead
but
we
going
on
this
evening
i
took
a
party
of
friends
through
the
mediterranean
and
up
the
nile
and
we
passed
venice
and
cairo
and
the
pyramids
and
the
suez
canal
and
they
never
once
looked
up
they
were
playing
bridge
and
you
think
i
joking
but
i
mean
just
literally
what
i
say
i
know
a
man
who
was
travelling
from
new
york
to
philadelphia
and
got
into
a
game
with
some
strangers
and
rode
all
the
way
to
palm
beach
to
finish
it
montague
heard
later
of
a
society
leader
who
was
totally
incapacitated
that
winter
from
too
much
bridge
at
newport
and
she
was
passing
the
winter
at
hot
springs
and
palm
beach
and
playing
bridge
there
they
played
it
even
in
sanitariums
to
which
they
had
been
driven
by
nervous
breakdown
it
was
an
occupation
so
exhausting
to
the
physique
of
women
that
physicians
came
to
know
the
symptoms
of
it
and
before
they
diagnosed
a
case
they
would
ask
do
you
play
bridge
it
had
destroyed
the
last
remnants
of
the
sabbath
it
was
a
universal
custom
to
have
on
that
day
it
was
a
very
expensive
game
as
they
played
it
in
society
one
might
easily
win
or
lose
several
thousand
dollars
in
an
evening
and
there
were
many
who
could
not
afford
this
if
one
did
not
play
he
would
be
dropped
from
the
lists
of
those
invited
and
when
one
entered
a
game
etiquette
required
him
to
stay
in
until
it
was
finished
so
one
heard
of
young
girls
who
had
pawned
their
family
plate
or
who
had
sold
their
honour
to
pay
their
bills
at
the
game
and
all
society
knew
of
one
youth
who
had
robbed
his
hostess
of
her
jewels
and
pawned
them
and
then
taken
her
the
tickets
telling
her
that
her
guests
had
robbed
him
there
were
women
received
in
the
best
society
who
lived
as
adventuresses
pure
and
simple
upon
their
skill
at
the
game
hostesses
would
invite
rich
guests
and
fleece
them
montague
never
forgot
the
sense
of
amazement
and
dismay
with
which
he
listened
while
first
winnie
and
then
his
brother
warned
him
that
he
must
avoid
playing
with
a
certain
aristocratic
dame
whom
he
met
in
this
most
aristocratic
household
because
she
was
such
a
notorious
cheater
my
dear
fellow
laughed
his
brother
when
he
protested
we
have
a
phrase
cheat
at
cards
like
a
woman
and
then
oliver
went
on
to
tell
him
of
his
own
first
experience
at
cards
in
society
when
he
had
played
poker
with
several
charming
young
débutantes
they
would
call
their
hands
and
take
the
money
without
showing
their
cards
and
he
had
been
too
gallant
to
ask
to
see
them
but
later
he
learned
that
this
was
a
regular
practice
and
so
he
never
played
poker
with
women
and
oliver
pointed
out
one
of
these
girls
to
his
brother
sitting
as
beautiful
as
a
picture
and
as
cold
as
marble
with
a
cigarette
on
the
edge
of
the
table
and
whisky
and
soda
and
glasses
of
cracked
ice
beside
her
later
on
as
he
chanced
to
be
reading
a
newspaper
his
brother
leaned
over
his
shoulder
and
pointed
out
another
of
the
symptoms
of
the
craze
an
advertisement
headed
your
luck
will
change
it
gave
notice
that
at
rosenstein
parlours
just
off
fifth
avenue
one
might
borrow
money
upon
expensive
gowns
and
furs
all
during
the
ten
days
of
this
winnie
devoted
herself
to
seeing
that
montague
had
a
good
time
winnie
sat
beside
him
at
table
he
found
that
somehow
a
convention
had
been
established
which
assigned
him
to
winnie
as
a
matter
of
course
nobody
said
anything
to
him
about
it
but
knowing
how
relentlessly
the
affairs
of
other
people
were
probed
and
analyzed
he
began
to
feel
exceedingly
uncomfortable
there
came
a
time
when
he
felt
quite
smothered
by
winnie
and
immediately
after
lunch
one
day
he
broke
away
and
went
for
a
long
walk
by
himself
this
was
the
occasion
of
his
meeting
with
an
adventure
an
inch
or
two
of
snow
had
fallen
and
lay
gleaming
in
the
sunlight
the
air
was
keen
and
he
drank
deep
draughts
of
it
and
went
striding
away
over
the
hills
for
an
hour
or
so
there
was
a
gale
blowing
and
as
he
came
over
the
summits
it
would
strike
him
and
he
would
see
the
river
white
with
foam
and
then
down
in
the
valleys
again
all
would
be
still
here
in
a
thickly
wooded
place
montague
attention
was
arrested
suddenly
by
a
peculiar
sound
a
heavy
thud
which
seemed
to
shake
the
earth
it
suggested
a
distant
explosion
and
he
stopped
for
a
moment
and
then
went
on
gazing
ahead
he
passed
a
turn
and
then
he
saw
a
great
tree
which
had
fallen
directly
across
the
road
he
went
on
thinking
that
this
was
what
he
had
heard
but
as
he
came
nearer
he
saw
his
mistake
beyond
the
tree
lay
something
else
and
he
began
to
run
toward
it
it
was
two
wheels
of
an
automobile
sticking
up
into
the
air
he
sprang
upon
the
and
in
one
glance
he
saw
the
whole
story
a
big
had
swept
round
the
sharp
turn
and
swerved
to
avoid
the
unexpected
obstruction
and
so
turned
a
somersault
into
the
ditch
montague
gave
a
thrill
of
horror
for
there
was
the
form
of
a
man
pinned
beneath
the
body
of
the
car
he
sprang
toward
it
but
a
second
glance
made
him
stop
he
saw
that
blood
had
gushed
from
the
man
mouth
and
soaked
the
snow
all
about
his
chest
was
visibly
crushed
flat
and
his
eyes
were
dreadful
from
their
sockets
for
a
moment
montague
stood
staring
as
if
turned
to
stone
then
from
the
other
side
of
the
car
came
a
moan
and
he
ran
toward
the
sound
a
second
man
lay
in
the
ditch
moving
feebly
montague
sprang
to
help
him
the
man
wore
a
heavy
bearskin
coat
montague
lifted
him
and
saw
that
he
was
a
very
elderly
person
with
a
cut
across
his
forehead
and
a
face
as
white
as
chalk
the
other
helped
him
to
a
position
with
his
back
against
the
bank
and
he
opened
his
eyes
and
groaned
montague
knelt
beside
him
watching
his
breathing
he
had
a
sense
of
utter
helplessness
there
was
nothing
he
could
think
of
to
do
save
to
unbutton
the
man
coat
and
keep
wiping
the
blood
from
his
face
some
whisky
the
stranger
moaned
montague
answered
that
he
had
none
but
the
other
replied
that
there
was
some
in
the
car
the
slope
of
the
bank
was
such
that
montague
could
crawl
under
and
find
the
compartment
with
the
bottle
in
it
the
old
man
drank
some
and
a
little
colour
came
back
to
his
face
as
the
other
watched
him
it
came
to
him
that
this
face
was
familiar
but
he
could
not
place
it
how
many
were
there
with
you
montague
asked
and
the
man
answered
only
one
montague
went
over
and
made
certain
that
the
other
man
who
was
obviously
the
chauffeur
was
dead
then
he
hurried
down
the
road
and
dragged
some
brush
out
into
the
middle
of
it
where
it
could
be
seen
from
a
distance
by
any
other
automobile
that
came
along
after
which
he
went
back
to
the
stranger
and
bound
his
handkerchief
about
his
forehead
to
stop
the
bleeding
from
the
cut
the
old
man
lips
were
tightly
set
as
if
he
were
suffering
great
pain
i
done
for
he
moaned
again
and
again
where
are
you
hurt
montague
asked
i
do
know
he
gasped
but
it
finished
me
i
know
it
it
the
last
straw
then
he
closed
his
eyes
and
lay
back
ca
you
get
a
doctor
he
asked
there
are
no
houses
very
near
said
montague
but
i
can
run
no
no
the
other
interrupted
anxiously
do
leave
me
some
one
will
oh
that
fool
of
a
chauffeur
why
could
he
go
slow
when
i
told
him
that
always
the
way
with
them
they
always
trying
to
show
off
the
man
is
dead
said
montague
quietly
the
other
started
upon
his
elbow
dead
he
gasped
yes
said
montague
he
under
the
car
the
old
man
eyes
had
started
wild
with
fright
and
he
caught
montague
by
the
arm
dead
he
said
o
my
god
and
it
might
have
been
me
there
was
a
moment
pause
the
stranger
caught
his
breath
and
whispered
again
i
done
for
i
ca
stand
it
it
too
much
montague
had
noticed
when
he
lifted
the
man
that
he
was
very
frail
and
slight
of
build
now
he
could
feel
that
the
hand
that
held
his
arm
was
trembling
violently
it
occurred
to
him
that
perhaps
the
man
was
not
really
hurt
but
that
his
nerves
had
been
upset
by
the
shock
and
he
felt
certain
of
this
a
moment
later
when
the
stranger
suddenly
leaned
forward
clutching
him
with
redoubled
intensity
and
staring
at
him
with
wide
eyes
do
you
know
what
it
means
to
be
afraid
of
death
he
panted
do
you
know
what
it
means
to
be
afraid
of
death
then
without
waiting
for
a
reply
he
rushed
on
no
no
you
ca
you
ca
i
do
believe
any
man
knows
it
as
i
do
think
of
it
for
ten
years
i
never
known
a
minute
when
i
was
afraid
of
death
it
follows
me
around
it
wo
let
me
be
it
leaps
out
at
me
in
places
like
this
and
when
i
escape
it
i
can
hear
it
laughing
at
me
for
it
knows
i
ca
get
away
the
old
man
caught
his
breath
with
a
choking
sob
he
was
clinging
to
montague
like
a
frightened
child
and
staring
with
a
wild
hunted
look
upon
his
face
montague
sat
transfixed
yes
the
other
rushed
on
that
the
truth
as
god
hears
me
and
it
the
first
time
i
ever
spoken
it
in
my
life
i
have
to
hide
it
because
men
would
laugh
at
me
they
pretend
they
not
afraid
but
i
lie
awake
all
night
and
it
like
a
fiend
that
sits
by
my
bedside
i
lie
and
listen
to
my
own
heart
i
feel
it
beating
and
i
think
how
weak
it
is
and
what
thin
walls
it
has
and
what
a
wretched
helpless
thing
it
is
to
have
your
life
depend
on
that
you
do
know
what
that
is
i
suppose
montague
shook
his
head
you
young
you
see
said
the
other
you
have
health
everybody
has
health
except
me
and
everybody
hates
me
i
have
got
a
friend
in
the
world
montague
was
quite
taken
aback
by
the
suddenness
of
this
outburst
he
tried
to
stop
it
for
he
felt
almost
indecent
in
listening
it
was
not
fair
to
take
a
man
off
his
guard
like
this
but
the
stranger
could
not
be
stopped
he
was
completely
unstrung
and
his
voice
grew
louder
and
louder
it
every
word
of
it
true
he
exclaimed
wildly
and
i
ca
stand
it
any
more
i
ca
stand
anything
any
more
i
was
young
and
strong
once
i
could
take
care
of
myself
and
i
said
i
make
money
i
be
master
of
other
men
but
i
was
a
fool
i
forgot
my
health
and
now
all
the
money
on
earth
ca
do
me
any
good
i
give
ten
million
dollars
for
a
body
like
any
other
man
and
this
this
is
what
i
have
he
struck
his
hands
against
his
bosom
look
at
it
he
cried
hysterically
this
is
what
i
got
to
live
in
it
wo
digest
any
food
and
i
ca
keep
it
warm
there
nothing
right
with
it
how
would
you
like
to
lie
awake
at
night
and
say
to
yourself
that
your
teeth
were
decaying
and
you
could
help
it
your
hair
was
falling
out
and
nobody
could
stop
it
you
old
and
worn
out
falling
to
pieces
and
everybody
hates
you
everybody
waiting
for
you
to
die
so
that
they
can
get
you
out
of
the
way
the
doctors
come
and
they
all
humbugs
they
shake
their
heads
and
use
long
words
they
know
they
ca
do
you
any
good
but
they
want
their
big
fees
and
all
they
do
is
to
frighten
you
worse
and
make
you
sicker
than
ever
there
was
nothing
that
montague
could
do
save
to
sit
and
listen
to
this
outburst
of
wretchedness
his
attempts
to
soothe
the
old
man
only
had
the
effect
of
exciting
him
more
why
does
it
all
have
to
fall
on
me
he
moaned
i
want
to
be
like
other
people
i
want
to
live
and
instead
i
like
a
man
with
a
pack
of
hungry
wolves
prowling
round
him
that
what
it
like
it
like
nature
hungry
and
cruel
and
savage
you
think
you
know
what
life
is
it
seems
so
beautiful
and
gentle
and
pleasant
that
when
you
on
top
but
now
i
down
and
i
know
what
it
is
it
a
thing
like
a
nightmare
that
reaches
out
for
you
to
clutch
you
and
crush
you
and
you
ca
get
away
from
it
you
helpless
as
a
rat
in
a
corner
you
damned
you
damned
the
miserable
man
voice
broke
in
a
cry
of
despair
and
he
sank
down
in
a
heap
in
front
of
montague
shaking
and
sobbing
the
other
was
trembling
slightly
and
stricken
with
awe
there
was
a
long
silence
and
then
the
stranger
lifted
his
face
and
montague
helped
to
support
him
have
a
little
more
of
the
whisky
said
he
no
the
other
answered
feebly
i
better
not
my
doctors
wo
let
me
have
whisky
he
added
after
a
while
that
my
liver
i
so
many
you
know
that
it
takes
a
to
keep
track
of
them
and
all
of
them
together
do
me
no
good
think
of
it
i
have
to
live
on
graham
crackers
and
milk
actually
not
a
thing
has
passed
my
lips
for
two
years
but
graham
crackers
and
milk
and
then
suddenly
with
a
start
it
came
to
montague
where
he
had
seen
this
wrinkled
old
face
before
it
was
laura
hegan
uncle
whom
the
major
had
pointed
out
to
him
in
the
of
the
club
old
henry
grimes
who
was
really
only
sixty
but
looked
eighty
and
who
owned
slum
tenements
and
evicted
more
people
in
a
month
than
could
be
crowded
into
the
montague
gave
no
sign
but
sat
holding
the
man
in
his
arms
a
little
trickle
of
blood
came
from
under
the
handkerchief
and
ran
down
his
cheek
montague
felt
him
tremble
as
he
touched
this
with
his
ringer
is
it
much
of
a
cut
he
asked
not
much
said
montague
two
or
three
stitches
perhaps
send
for
my
family
physician
the
other
added
if
i
should
faint
or
anything
you
find
his
name
in
my
what
that
there
was
the
sound
of
voices
down
the
road
hello
montague
shouted
and
a
moment
later
two
men
in
automobile
costume
came
running
toward
him
they
stopped
staring
in
dismay
at
the
sight
which
confronted
them
at
montague
suggestion
they
made
haste
to
find
a
log
by
means
of
which
they
lifted
the
auto
sufficiently
to
drag
out
the
body
of
the
chauffeur
montague
saw
that
it
was
quite
cold
he
went
back
to
old
grimes
where
do
you
wish
to
go
he
asked
the
other
hesitated
i
was
bound
for
the
harrisons
he
said
the
leslie
harrisons
asked
montague
they
were
people
he
had
met
at
the
devons
the
other
noticed
his
look
of
recognition
do
you
know
them
he
asked
i
do
said
montague
it
is
far
said
the
old
man
perhaps
i
had
best
go
there
and
then
he
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
catching
montague
by
the
arm
and
pulling
him
toward
him
whispered
tell
me
wo
tell
montague
comprehending
what
he
meant
answered
it
will
be
between
us
at
the
same
time
he
felt
a
new
thrill
of
revulsion
for
this
most
miserable
old
creature
they
lifted
him
into
the
car
and
because
they
delayed
long
enough
to
lay
a
blanket
over
the
body
of
the
chauffeur
he
asked
peevishly
why
they
did
not
start
during
the
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
trip
he
sat
clinging
to
montague
shuddering
with
fright
every
time
they
rounded
a
turn
in
the
road
they
reached
the
harrisons
place
and
the
footman
who
opened
the
door
was
startled
out
of
his
studied
impassivity
by
the
sight
of
a
big
bundle
of
bearskin
in
montague
arms
send
for
harrison
said
montague
and
laid
the
bundle
upon
a
divan
in
the
hall
get
a
doctor
as
quickly
as
you
can
he
added
to
a
second
attendant
harrison
came
it
grimes
said
montague
and
then
he
heard
a
frightened
exclamation
and
turned
and
saw
laura
hegan
in
a
walking
costume
fresh
from
the
cold
outside
what
is
it
she
cried
and
he
told
her
as
quickly
as
he
could
and
she
ran
to
help
the
old
man
montague
stood
by
and
later
carried
him
upstairs
and
waited
below
until
the
doctor
came
it
was
only
when
he
set
out
for
home
again
that
he
found
time
to
think
about
laura
hegan
and
how
beautiful
she
had
looked
in
her
furs
he
wondered
if
it
would
always
be
his
fate
to
meet
her
under
circumstances
which
left
her
no
time
to
be
aware
of
his
own
existence
at
home
he
told
about
his
adventure
and
found
himself
quite
a
hero
for
the
rest
of
the
day
he
was
obliged
to
give
interviews
to
several
newspaper
reporters
and
to
refuse
to
let
one
of
them
take
his
picture
every
one
at
the
devons
seemed
to
know
old
harry
grimes
and
montague
thought
to
himself
that
if
the
comments
of
this
particular
group
of
people
were
a
fair
sample
the
poor
wretch
was
right
in
saying
that
he
had
not
a
friend
in
the
world
when
he
came
downstairs
the
next
morning
he
found
elaborate
accounts
of
the
accident
in
the
papers
and
learned
that
grimes
had
nothing
worse
than
a
scalp
wound
and
a
severe
shock
even
so
he
felt
it
was
incumbent
upon
him
to
pay
a
visit
of
inquiry
and
rode
over
shortly
before
lunch
laura
hegan
came
down
to
see
him
wearing
a
morning
gown
of
white
she
confirmed
the
good
news
of
the
papers
and
said
that
her
uncle
was
resting
quietly
she
did
not
say
that
his
physician
had
come
with
two
nurses
and
taken
up
his
residence
in
the
house
and
that
the
poor
old
millionaire
was
denied
even
his
graham
crackers
and
milk
instead
she
said
that
he
had
mentioned
montague
kindness
particularly
and
asked
her
to
thank
him
montague
was
cynical
enough
to
doubt
this
it
was
the
first
time
that
he
had
ever
had
any
occasion
to
talk
with
miss
hegan
he
noticed
her
gentle
and
caressing
voice
with
the
least
touch
of
the
south
in
it
and
he
was
glad
to
find
that
it
was
possible
for
her
to
talk
without
breaking
the
spell
of
her
serene
and
noble
beauty
montague
stayed
as
long
as
he
had
any
right
to
stay
and
all
the
way
as
he
rode
home
he
was
thinking
about
laura
hegan
here
for
the
first
time
was
a
woman
whom
he
felt
he
should
like
to
know
a
woman
with
reserve
and
dignity
and
some
ideas
in
her
life
and
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
know
her
because
she
was
rich
there
was
no
dodging
this
fact
montague
did
not
even
try
he
had
met
women
with
fortunes
already
and
he
knew
how
they
felt
about
themselves
and
how
the
rest
of
the
world
felt
about
them
they
might
wish
in
their
hearts
to
be
something
else
besides
the
keepers
of
a
but
their
wishes
were
futile
the
money
went
with
them
and
they
had
to
defend
it
against
all
comers
montague
recalled
one
heiress
after
another
débutantes
some
of
them
exquisite
and
delicate
as
butterflies
but
under
the
surface
as
hard
as
all
their
lives
they
had
been
trained
to
think
of
themselves
as
representing
money
and
of
every
one
who
came
near
them
as
adventurers
seeking
money
in
every
word
they
uttered
in
every
glance
and
motion
one
might
read
this
meaning
and
then
he
thought
of
laura
hegan
with
the
fortune
she
would
inherit
and
he
pictured
what
her
life
must
be
the
toadies
and
parasites
and
flatterers
who
would
lay
siege
to
her
the
scheming
mammas
and
the
affectionate
sisters
and
cousins
who
would
plot
to
gain
her
confidence
for
a
man
who
was
poor
and
who
meant
to
keep
his
was
there
any
possible
conclusion
except
that
she
was
entirely
unknowable
to
him
chapter
xvi
montague
came
back
to
the
city
and
dug
into
his
books
again
while
alice
gave
her
spare
hours
to
watching
the
progress
of
the
new
gown
in
which
she
was
to
uphold
the
honour
of
the
family
at
opening
ball
the
great
event
was
due
in
the
next
week
and
society
was
as
much
excited
about
it
as
a
family
of
children
before
christmas
all
whom
montague
met
were
invited
and
all
were
going
unless
they
happened
to
be
in
mourning
their
gossip
was
all
of
the
disappointed
ones
and
their
bitterness
and
heartburning
devon
mansion
was
thrown
open
early
on
the
eventful
evening
but
few
would
come
until
midnight
it
was
the
fashion
to
attend
the
opera
first
and
previous
to
that
half
a
dozen
people
would
give
big
dinners
he
was
a
fortunate
person
who
did
not
hear
from
his
liver
after
this
occasion
for
at
one
came
devon
massive
supper
and
then
again
at
four
another
supper
to
prepare
these
repasts
a
dozen
extra
chefs
had
been
imported
into
the
devon
establishment
for
a
week
for
it
was
part
of
the
great
lady
pride
to
permit
no
outside
caterer
to
prepare
anything
for
her
guests
montague
had
never
been
able
to
get
over
his
wonder
at
the
social
phenomenon
known
as
devon
he
came
and
took
his
chances
in
the
jostling
throngs
and
except
that
he
got
into
casual
conversation
with
one
of
the
numerous
detectives
whom
he
took
for
a
guest
he
came
off
fairly
well
but
all
the
time
that
he
was
being
passed
about
and
introduced
and
danced
with
he
was
looking
about
him
and
wondering
the
grand
staircase
and
the
hall
and
parlours
had
been
turned
into
tropical
gardens
with
palms
and
trailing
vines
and
azaleas
and
roses
and
great
vases
of
scarlet
poinsettia
with
hundreds
of
lights
glowing
through
them
it
was
said
that
this
ball
had
exhausted
the
flower
supply
of
the
country
as
far
south
as
atlanta
and
then
in
the
reception
room
one
came
upon
the
little
old
lady
standing
beneath
a
bower
of
orchids
she
was
clad
in
a
robe
of
royal
purple
trimmed
with
silver
and
girdled
about
with
an
of
gems
if
one
might
credit
the
papers
the
diamonds
that
were
worn
at
one
of
these
balls
were
valued
at
twenty
million
dollars
the
stranger
was
quite
overwhelmed
by
all
the
splendour
there
was
a
cotillion
danced
by
two
hundred
gorgeously
clad
women
and
their
partners
a
scene
so
gay
that
one
could
only
think
of
it
as
happening
in
a
fairy
legend
or
some
old
romance
of
knighthood
four
sets
of
favours
were
given
during
this
function
and
jewels
and
objects
of
art
were
showered
forth
as
if
from
a
magician
wand
devon
herself
soon
disappeared
but
the
riot
of
music
and
went
on
until
near
morning
and
during
all
this
time
the
halls
and
rooms
of
the
great
mansion
were
so
crowded
that
one
could
scarcely
move
about
then
one
went
home
and
realized
that
all
this
splendour
and
the
human
effort
which
it
represented
had
been
for
nothing
but
a
memory
nor
would
he
get
the
full
meaning
of
it
if
he
failed
to
realize
that
it
was
simply
one
of
thousands
a
pattern
which
every
one
there
would
strive
to
follow
in
some
function
of
his
own
it
was
a
signal
bell
which
told
the
world
that
the
season
was
open
it
loosed
the
floodgates
of
extravagance
and
the
torrent
of
dissipation
poured
forth
from
then
on
there
would
be
a
continuous
round
of
gaieties
one
might
have
three
banquets
every
single
night
for
a
dinner
and
two
suppers
was
now
the
custom
at
entertainments
and
filling
the
rest
of
one
day
were
receptions
and
teas
and
musicales
a
person
might
take
his
choice
among
a
score
of
opportunities
and
never
leave
the
circle
he
met
at
devon
nor
was
this
counting
the
tens
of
thousands
of
aspirants
and
imitators
all
over
the
city
nor
in
a
host
of
other
cities
each
with
thousands
of
women
who
had
nothing
to
do
save
to
ape
the
ways
of
the
metropolis
the
mind
could
not
realize
the
volume
of
this
deluge
of
destruction
it
was
a
thing
which
stunned
the
senses
and
thundered
in
one
ears
like
niagara
the
meaning
of
it
all
did
not
stop
with
the
people
who
poured
it
forth
its
effects
were
to
be
traced
through
the
whole
country
there
were
hordes
of
tradesmen
and
manufacturers
who
supplied
what
society
bought
and
whose
study
it
was
to
induce
people
to
buy
as
much
as
possible
and
so
they
devised
what
were
called
fashions
little
eccentricities
of
cut
and
material
which
made
everything
go
out
of
date
quickly
there
had
once
been
two
seasons
but
now
there
were
four
and
through
window
displays
and
millions
of
advertisements
the
public
was
lured
into
the
trap
the
yellow
journals
would
give
whole
pages
to
describing
what
the
are
wearing
there
were
magazines
with
many
millions
of
readers
which
existed
for
nothing
save
to
propagate
these
ideas
and
everywhere
in
all
classes
of
society
men
and
women
were
starving
their
minds
and
hearts
and
straining
their
energies
to
follow
this
phantom
of
fashion
the
masses
were
kept
poor
because
of
it
and
the
youth
and
hope
of
the
world
was
betrayed
by
it
in
country
villages
poor
farmers
wives
were
trimming
their
bonnets
over
to
be
stylish
and
in
the
cities
were
wearing
imitation
sealskins
and
and
sempstresses
selling
themselves
into
brothels
for
the
sake
of
ribbons
and
gilt
jewellery
it
was
the
instinct
of
decoration
perverted
by
the
in
the
metropolis
the
sole
test
of
excellence
was
money
and
the
possession
of
money
was
the
proof
of
power
and
every
natural
desire
of
men
and
women
had
been
tainted
by
this
influence
the
love
of
beauty
the
impulse
to
hospitality
the
joys
of
music
and
dancing
and
love
all
these
things
had
become
simply
means
to
the
demonstration
of
the
men
were
busy
making
more
money
but
their
idle
women
had
nothing
in
life
save
this
mad
race
in
display
so
it
had
come
about
that
the
woman
who
could
consume
wealth
most
conspicuously
who
was
the
most
effective
instrument
for
the
destroying
of
the
labour
and
the
lives
of
other
people
this
was
the
woman
who
was
most
applauded
and
most
noticed
the
most
appalling
fact
about
society
was
this
utter
blind
materialism
such
expectations
as
montague
had
brought
with
him
had
been
derived
from
the
literature
of
europe
in
a
grand
monde
such
as
this
he
expected
to
meet
diplomats
and
statesmen
scientists
and
explorers
philosophers
and
poets
and
painters
but
one
never
heard
anything
about
such
people
in
society
it
was
a
mark
of
eccentricity
to
be
interested
in
intellectual
affairs
and
one
might
go
about
for
weeks
and
not
meet
a
person
with
an
idea
when
these
people
read
it
was
a
novel
and
when
they
went
to
the
play
it
was
a
musical
comedy
the
one
single
intellectual
product
which
it
could
point
to
as
its
own
was
a
rancid
used
mainly
as
a
means
of
blackmail
now
and
then
some
aspiring
young
matron
of
the
elite
would
try
to
set
up
a
salon
after
the
fashion
of
the
continent
and
would
gather
a
few
feeble
wits
about
her
for
a
time
but
for
the
most
part
the
intellectual
workers
of
the
city
held
themselves
severely
aloof
and
society
was
left
a
little
clique
of
people
whose
fortunes
had
become
historic
in
a
decade
or
two
and
who
got
together
in
each
other
palaces
and
gorged
themselves
and
gambled
and
gossiped
about
each
other
and
wove
about
their
personalities
a
veil
of
awful
and
exclusive
majesty
montague
found
himself
thinking
that
perhaps
it
was
not
they
who
were
to
blame
it
was
not
they
who
had
set
up
wealth
as
the
end
and
goal
of
things
it
was
the
whole
community
of
which
they
were
a
part
it
was
not
their
fault
that
they
had
been
left
with
power
and
nothing
to
use
it
for
it
was
not
their
fault
that
their
sons
and
daughters
found
themselves
stranded
in
the
world
deprived
of
all
necessity
and
of
the
possibility
of
doing
anything
useful
the
most
pitiful
aspect
of
the
whole
thing
to
montague
was
this
second
generation
who
were
coming
upon
the
scene
with
their
lives
all
poisoned
in
advance
no
wrong
which
they
could
do
to
the
world
would
ever
equal
the
wrong
which
the
world
had
done
them
in
permitting
them
to
have
money
which
they
had
not
earned
they
were
cut
off
for
ever
from
reality
and
from
the
possibility
of
understanding
life
they
had
big
healthy
bodies
and
they
craved
experience
and
they
had
absolutely
nothing
to
do
that
was
the
real
meaning
of
all
this
orgy
of
dissipation
this
social
whirl
as
it
was
called
it
was
the
frantic
chase
of
some
new
thrill
some
excitement
that
would
stir
the
senses
of
people
who
had
nothing
in
the
world
to
interest
them
that
was
why
they
were
building
palaces
and
flinging
largesses
of
banquets
and
balls
and
tearing
about
the
country
in
automobiles
and
travelling
over
the
earth
in
steam
yachts
and
private
trains
and
first
and
last
the
lesson
of
their
efforts
was
that
the
chase
was
futile
the
jaded
nerves
would
not
thrill
the
most
conspicuous
fact
about
society
was
its
unutterable
and
agonizing
boredom
of
its
great
solemn
functions
the
would
read
with
greedy
envy
but
the
women
who
attended
them
would
be
half
asleep
behind
their
jewelled
fans
it
was
typified
to
montague
by
billy
alden
yachting
party
on
the
nile
yawning
in
the
face
of
the
sphinx
and
playing
bridge
beneath
the
shadow
of
the
pyramids
and
counting
the
crocodiles
and
proposing
to
jump
in
by
way
of
changing
the
pain
people
attended
these
ceaseless
rounds
of
entertainments
simply
because
they
dreaded
to
be
left
alone
they
wandered
from
place
to
place
following
like
a
herd
of
sheep
whatever
leader
would
inaugurate
a
new
diversion
one
could
have
filled
a
volume
with
the
list
of
their
fads
there
were
new
ones
every
week
if
society
did
not
invent
them
the
yellow
journals
invented
them
there
was
a
woman
who
had
her
teeth
filled
with
diamonds
and
another
who
was
driving
a
pair
of
zebras
one
heard
of
monkey
dinners
and
pyjama
dinners
at
newport
of
horseback
dinners
and
vegetable
dances
in
new
york
one
heard
of
and
and
talking
crows
and
rare
orchids
and
reindeer
meat
of
bracelets
for
men
and
ankle
rings
for
women
of
at
ten
and
twenty
thousand
dollars
each
of
weird
and
repulsive
pets
chameleons
and
lizards
and
there
was
one
young
woman
who
wore
a
as
a
necklace
one
would
take
to
slumming
and
another
to
sniffing
brandy
through
the
nose
one
had
a
made
of
woven
roses
and
another
was
wearing
perfumed
flannel
at
sixteen
dollars
a
yard
one
had
inaugurated
in
august
and
another
had
started
a
class
for
the
study
of
plato
some
were
giving
tennis
tournaments
in
and
playing
after
dinner
others
had
got
dispensations
from
the
pope
so
that
they
might
have
private
chapels
and
confessors
and
yet
others
were
giving
progressive
dinners
moving
from
one
restaurant
to
another
a
cocktail
and
at
sherry
a
soup
and
madeira
at
delmonico
some
terrapin
with
amontillado
at
the
waldorf
and
so
on
one
of
the
consequences
of
the
furious
pace
was
that
people
health
broke
down
very
quickly
and
there
were
all
sorts
of
bizarre
ways
of
restoring
it
one
person
would
be
eating
nothing
but
spinach
and
another
would
be
living
on
grass
one
would
chew
a
mouthful
of
soup
times
another
would
eat
every
two
hours
and
another
only
once
a
week
some
went
out
in
the
early
morning
and
walked
in
the
grass
and
others
went
hopping
about
the
floor
on
their
hands
and
knees
to
take
off
fat
there
were
rest
cures
and
water
cures
new
thought
and
metaphysical
healing
and
christian
science
there
was
an
automatic
horse
which
one
might
ride
indoors
with
a
register
showing
the
distance
travelled
montague
met
one
man
who
had
an
electric
machine
which
cost
thirty
thousand
dollars
and
which
took
hold
of
his
arms
and
feet
and
exercised
him
while
he
waited
he
met
a
woman
who
told
him
she
was
riding
an
electric
camel
everywhere
one
went
there
were
new
people
spending
their
money
in
new
and
incredible
ways
here
was
a
man
who
had
bought
a
chapel
and
turned
it
into
a
theatre
and
hired
professional
actors
and
persuaded
his
friends
to
come
and
see
him
act
shakespeare
here
was
a
woman
who
costumed
herself
after
figures
in
famous
paintings
with
arrangements
of
roses
and
cherry
leaves
and
wreaths
of
ivy
and
laurel
and
with
costumes
for
her
pet
dogs
to
match
here
was
a
man
who
paid
six
dollars
a
day
for
a
carnation
four
inches
across
and
a
girl
who
wore
a
hat
trimmed
with
fresh
and
a
ball
costume
with
swarms
of
real
butterflies
tied
with
silk
threads
and
another
with
a
hat
made
of
woven
silver
with
ostrich
plumes
forty
inches
long
made
entirely
of
silver
films
here
was
a
man
who
hired
a
military
company
to
drill
all
day
long
to
prepare
a
floor
for
dancing
and
another
who
put
up
a
building
at
a
cost
of
thirty
thousand
dollars
to
give
a
débutante
dance
for
his
daughter
and
then
had
it
torn
down
the
day
after
here
was
a
man
who
bred
rattlesnakes
and
turned
them
loose
by
thousands
and
had
driven
everybody
away
from
the
north
carolina
estate
of
one
of
the
wallings
here
was
a
man
who
was
building
himself
a
yacht
with
a
model
dairy
and
bakery
on
board
and
a
french
laundry
and
a
brass
band
here
was
a
with
on
it
and
a
platoon
of
marksmen
and
some
chinese
laundrymen
and
two
physicians
for
its
occupant
here
was
a
man
who
had
bought
a
rhine
castle
for
of
a
million
and
spent
as
much
in
restoring
it
and
filled
it
with
servants
dressed
in
costumes
here
was
a
art
collection
hidden
away
where
nobody
ever
saw
it
one
saw
the
meaning
of
this
madness
most
clearly
in
the
young
men
of
society
some
were
killing
themselves
and
other
people
in
automobile
races
at
a
hundred
and
twenty
miles
an
hour
some
went
in
for
mere
shells
of
things
shaped
like
a
that
tore
through
the
water
at
forty
miles
an
hour
some
would
hire
professional
pugilists
to
knock
them
out
others
would
get
up
and
and
boxing
matches
with
kangaroos
montague
was
taken
to
the
home
of
one
young
man
who
had
given
his
life
to
hunting
wild
game
in
every
corner
of
the
globe
and
would
travel
round
the
world
for
a
new
species
to
add
to
his
museum
of
trophies
he
had
heard
that
baron
rothschild
had
offered
a
thousand
pounds
for
a
bongo
a
huge
animal
which
no
white
man
had
ever
seen
and
he
had
taken
a
year
trip
into
the
interior
with
a
train
of
a
hundred
and
thirty
natives
and
had
brought
out
the
heads
of
forty
different
species
including
a
bongo
which
the
baron
did
not
get
he
met
another
who
had
helped
to
organize
a
balloon
club
and
two
trips
in
the
clouds
this
by
the
way
was
the
latest
sport
at
tuxedo
they
had
races
between
balloons
and
automobiles
and
montague
met
one
young
lady
who
boasted
that
she
had
been
up
five
times
there
was
another
young
millionaire
who
sat
and
patiently
taught
sunday
school
in
the
presence
of
a
host
of
reporters
there
was
another
who
set
up
a
chain
of
newspapers
all
over
the
country
and
made
war
upon
his
class
there
were
others
who
went
in
for
settlement
work
and
russian
revolutionists
there
were
even
some
who
called
themselves
socialists
montague
thought
that
this
was
the
strangest
fad
of
all
and
when
he
met
one
of
these
young
men
at
an
afternoon
tea
he
gazed
at
him
with
wonder
and
perplexity
thinking
of
the
man
he
had
heard
ranting
on
the
this
was
the
second
generation
appalling
as
it
was
to
think
of
there
was
a
third
growing
up
and
getting
ready
to
take
the
stage
and
with
wealth
accumulating
faster
than
ever
who
could
guess
what
they
might
do
there
were
still
in
society
a
few
men
and
women
who
had
earned
their
money
and
had
some
idea
of
the
toil
and
suffering
that
it
stood
for
but
when
the
third
generation
had
taken
possession
these
would
all
be
dead
or
forgotten
and
there
would
no
longer
be
any
link
to
connect
them
with
reality
in
the
light
of
this
thought
one
was
moved
to
watch
the
children
of
the
rich
some
of
these
had
inherited
scores
of
millions
of
dollars
while
they
were
still
in
the
cradle
now
and
then
one
of
them
would
be
presented
with
a
house
for
a
birthday
gift
when
such
a
baby
was
born
the
newspapers
would
give
pages
to
describing
its
layette
with
baby
dresses
at
a
hundred
dollars
each
and
lace
handkerchiefs
at
five
dollars
and
with
tiny
gold
brushes
and
one
might
see
a
picture
of
the
precious
object
in
a
moses
basket
covered
with
rare
and
wonderful
valenciennes
lace
this
child
would
grow
up
in
an
atmosphere
of
luxury
and
it
would
be
bullying
the
servants
at
the
age
of
six
and
talking
scandal
and
smoking
cigarettes
at
twelve
it
would
be
petted
and
admired
and
stared
at
and
paraded
about
in
state
dressed
up
like
a
french
doll
it
would
drink
in
snobbery
and
hatefulness
with
the
very
air
it
breathed
one
might
meet
in
these
great
houses
little
tots
not
yet
in
their
teens
whose
talk
was
all
of
the
cost
of
things
and
of
the
inferiority
of
their
neighbours
there
was
nothing
in
the
world
too
good
for
they
had
little
miniature
automobiles
to
ride
about
the
country
in
and
blooded
arabian
ponies
and
in
real
louis
seize
with
jewelled
rugs
and
miniature
electric
lights
at
caroline
smythe
montague
was
introduced
to
a
pale
and
youth
of
thirteen
who
dined
in
solemn
state
alone
when
the
rest
of
the
family
was
away
and
insisted
upon
having
all
the
footmen
in
attendance
and
his
unfortunate
aunt
brought
a
storm
about
her
ears
by
forbidding
the
butler
to
take
champagne
upstairs
into
the
nursery
before
lunch
a
little
remark
stayed
in
montague
mind
as
expressing
the
attitude
of
society
toward
such
matters
major
venable
had
chanced
to
remark
jestingly
that
children
were
coming
to
understand
so
much
nowadays
that
it
was
necessary
for
the
ladies
to
be
careful
to
which
vivie
patton
answered
with
a
sudden
access
of
seriousness
i
do
know
do
you
find
that
children
have
any
morals
mine
have
and
then
the
fascinating
vivie
went
on
to
tell
the
truth
about
her
own
children
they
were
savages
and
that
was
all
there
was
to
it
they
did
as
they
pleased
and
no
one
could
stop
them
the
major
replied
that
nowadays
all
the
world
was
doing
as
it
pleased
and
no
one
seemed
to
be
able
to
stop
it
and
with
that
jest
the
conversation
was
turned
to
other
matters
but
montague
sat
in
silence
thinking
about
it
wondering
what
would
happen
to
the
world
when
it
had
fallen
under
the
sway
of
this
generation
of
spoiled
children
and
had
adopted
altogether
the
religion
of
doing
as
one
pleased
in
the
beginning
people
had
simply
done
as
they
pleased
spontaneously
and
without
thinking
about
it
but
now
montague
discovered
the
custom
had
spread
to
such
an
extent
that
it
was
developing
a
philosophy
there
was
springing
up
a
new
cult
whose
devotees
were
planning
to
make
over
the
world
upon
the
plan
of
doing
as
one
pleased
because
its
members
were
wealthy
and
able
to
command
the
talent
of
the
world
the
cult
was
developing
an
art
with
a
highly
perfected
technique
and
a
literature
which
was
subtle
and
exquisite
and
alluring
europe
had
had
such
a
literature
for
a
century
and
england
for
a
generation
or
two
and
now
america
was
having
it
too
montague
had
an
amusing
insight
into
this
one
day
when
vivie
invited
him
to
one
of
her
artistic
evenings
vivie
was
in
touch
with
a
special
set
which
went
in
for
intellectual
things
and
included
some
amateur
bohemians
and
men
of
genius
do
you
come
if
be
shocked
she
had
said
to
him
for
strathcona
will
be
there
montague
deemed
himself
able
to
stand
a
good
deal
by
this
time
he
went
and
found
vivie
and
her
count
vivie
had
apparently
not
been
invited
and
also
the
young
poet
of
diabolism
whose
work
was
just
then
the
talk
of
the
town
he
was
a
tall
slender
youth
with
a
white
face
and
melancholy
black
eyes
and
black
locks
falling
in
cascades
about
his
ears
he
sat
in
an
oriental
corner
with
a
manuscript
copied
in
tiny
handwriting
upon
delicately
scented
art
paper
and
tied
with
passionate
purple
ribbons
a
young
girl
clad
in
white
sat
by
his
side
and
held
a
candle
while
he
read
from
this
manuscript
his
unprinted
because
unprintable
verses
and
between
the
readings
the
young
poet
talked
he
talked
about
himself
and
his
work
apparently
that
was
what
he
had
come
to
talk
about
his
words
flowed
like
a
swift
stream
limpid
sparkling
incessant
leaping
from
place
to
place
here
there
quick
as
the
play
of
light
upon
the
water
montague
laboured
to
follow
the
speaker
ideas
until
he
found
his
mind
in
a
whirl
and
gave
it
up
afterward
when
he
thought
it
over
he
laughed
at
himself
for
strathcona
ideas
were
not
serious
things
having
relationship
to
truth
they
were
epigrams
put
together
to
dazzle
the
hearer
studies
in
paradox
with
as
much
relation
to
life
as
fireworks
he
took
the
of
the
moral
experience
of
the
human
race
and
turned
it
upside
down
and
jumbled
it
about
and
used
it
as
bits
of
glass
in
a
kaleidoscope
and
the
hearers
would
gasp
and
whisper
diabolical
the
motto
of
this
school
of
poets
was
that
there
was
neither
good
nor
evil
but
that
all
things
were
interesting
after
listening
to
strathcona
for
half
an
hour
one
felt
like
hiding
his
head
and
denying
that
he
had
ever
thought
of
having
any
virtue
in
a
world
where
all
things
were
uncertain
it
was
presumptuous
even
to
pretend
to
know
what
virtue
was
one
could
only
be
what
one
was
and
did
not
that
mean
that
one
must
do
as
one
pleased
you
could
feel
a
shudder
run
through
the
company
at
his
audacity
and
the
worst
of
it
was
that
you
could
not
dismiss
it
with
a
laugh
for
the
boy
was
really
a
poet
he
had
fire
and
passion
the
gift
of
melodious
ecstacy
he
was
only
twenty
and
in
his
brief
meteor
flight
he
had
run
the
gamut
of
all
experience
he
had
familiarized
himself
with
all
human
achievement
past
present
and
future
there
was
nothing
any
one
could
mention
that
he
did
not
perfectly
comprehend
the
raptures
of
the
saints
the
consecration
of
the
martyrs
yes
he
had
known
them
likewise
he
had
touched
the
depths
of
depravity
he
had
been
lost
in
the
innermost
passages
of
the
caverns
of
hell
and
all
this
had
been
interesting
in
its
time
now
he
was
sighing
for
new
worlds
of
experience
say
for
unrequited
love
which
should
drive
him
to
madness
it
was
at
this
point
that
montague
dropped
out
of
the
race
and
took
to
studying
from
the
outside
the
mechanism
of
this
young
conversation
strathcona
flouted
the
idea
of
a
moral
sense
but
in
reality
he
was
quite
dependent
upon
it
his
recipe
for
making
epigrams
was
to
take
what
other
people
moral
sense
made
them
respect
and
identify
it
with
something
which
their
moral
sense
made
them
abhor
thus
for
instance
the
tale
which
he
told
about
one
of
the
members
of
his
set
who
was
a
relative
of
a
bishop
the
great
man
had
occasion
to
rebuke
him
for
his
profligate
ways
declaring
in
the
course
of
his
lecture
that
he
was
living
off
the
reputation
of
his
father
to
which
the
boy
made
the
crushing
rejoinder
it
may
be
bad
to
live
off
the
reputation
of
one
father
but
it
better
than
living
off
the
reputation
of
god
this
was
very
subtle
and
it
was
necessary
to
ponder
it
god
was
dead
and
the
worthy
bishop
did
not
know
it
but
let
him
take
a
new
god
who
had
no
reputation
and
go
out
into
the
world
and
make
a
living
out
of
him
then
strathcona
discussed
literature
he
paid
his
tribute
to
the
fleurs
de
mal
and
the
songs
before
sunrise
but
most
he
said
he
owed
to
the
divine
oscar
this
english
poet
of
many
poses
and
some
vices
the
law
had
seized
and
flung
into
jail
and
since
the
law
is
a
thing
so
brutal
and
wicked
that
whoever
is
touched
by
it
is
made
thereby
a
martyr
and
a
hero
there
had
grown
up
quite
a
cult
about
the
memory
of
oscar
all
poets
imitated
his
style
and
his
attitude
to
life
and
so
the
most
revolting
of
vices
had
the
cloak
of
romance
flung
about
them
were
given
long
greek
and
latin
names
and
discussed
with
parade
of
learning
as
revivals
of
hellenic
ideals
the
young
men
in
strathcona
set
referred
to
each
other
as
their
lovers
and
if
one
showed
any
perplexity
over
this
he
was
regarded
not
with
contempt
for
it
was
not
aesthetic
to
feel
contempt
but
with
a
slight
lifting
of
the
eyebrows
intended
to
annihilate
one
must
not
forget
of
course
that
these
young
people
were
poets
and
to
that
extent
were
protected
from
their
own
doctrines
they
were
interested
not
in
life
but
in
making
pretty
verses
about
life
there
were
some
among
them
who
lived
as
cheerful
ascetics
in
garret
rooms
and
gave
melodious
expression
to
devilish
emotions
but
on
the
other
hand
for
every
poet
there
were
thousands
who
were
not
poets
but
people
to
whom
life
was
real
and
these
lived
out
the
creed
and
wrecked
their
lives
and
with
the
aid
of
the
poet
magic
the
glamour
of
melody
and
the
fire
divine
they
wrecked
the
lives
with
which
they
came
into
contact
the
new
generation
of
boys
and
girls
were
deriving
their
spiritual
sustenance
from
the
poetry
of
baudelaire
and
wilde
and
rushing
with
the
hot
impulsiveness
of
youth
into
the
dreadful
traps
which
the
traders
in
vice
prepared
for
them
one
heart
bled
to
see
them
and

the

chapter
xvii
the
social
mill
ground
on
for
another
month
montague
withdrew
himself
as
much
as
his
brother
would
let
him
but
alice
was
on
the
go
all
night
and
half
the
day
oliver
had
sold
his
racing
automobile
to
a
friend
he
was
a
man
of
family
now
he
said
and
his
wild
days
were
over
he
had
got
instead
a
limousine
car
for
alice
though
she
declared
she
had
no
need
of
it
if
ever
she
was
going
to
any
place
charlie
carter
always
begged
her
to
use
his
charlie
siege
was
as
persistent
as
ever
as
montague
noticed
with
annoyance
the
great
law
case
was
going
forward
after
weeks
of
study
and
investigation
montague
felt
that
he
had
the
matter
well
in
hand
and
he
had
taken
hasbrook
memoranda
as
a
basis
for
a
new
work
of
his
own
much
more
substantial
bit
by
bit
as
he
dug
into
the
subject
he
had
discovered
a
state
of
affairs
in
the
fidelity
company
and
indeed
in
the
whole
insurance
business
and
its
allied
realms
of
banking
and
finance
which
shocked
him
profoundly
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
imagine
how
such
conditions
could
exist
and
remain
unknown
to
the
public
more
especially
as
every
one
in
wall
street
with
whom
he
talked
seemed
to
know
about
them
and
to
take
them
for
granted
his
client
papers
had
provided
him
with
references
to
the
books
montague
had
taken
this
dry
material
and
made
of
it
a
protest
which
had
the
breath
of
life
in
it
it
was
a
thing
at
which
he
toiled
with
deadly
earnestness
it
was
not
merely
a
struggle
of
one
man
to
get
a
few
thousand
dollars
it
was
an
appeal
in
behalf
of
millions
of
helpless
people
whose
trust
had
been
betrayed
it
was
the
first
step
in
a
long
campaign
which
the
young
lawyer
meant
should
force
a
great
evil
into
the
light
of
day
he
went
over
his
bill
of
complaint
with
hasbrook
and
he
was
glad
to
see
that
the
work
he
had
done
made
its
impression
upon
him
in
fact
his
client
was
a
little
afraid
that
some
of
his
arguments
might
be
too
radical
in
tone
from
the
strictly
legal
point
of
view
he
made
haste
to
explain
but
montague
reassured
him
upon
this
point
and
then
came
the
day
when
the
great
ship
was
ready
for
launching
the
news
must
have
spread
quickly
for
a
few
hours
after
the
papers
in
the
suit
had
been
filed
montague
received
a
call
from
a
newspaper
reporter
who
told
him
of
the
excitement
in
financial
circles
where
the
thing
had
fallen
like
a
bomb
montague
explained
the
purpose
of
the
suit
and
gave
the
reporter
a
number
of
facts
which
he
felt
certain
would
attract
attention
to
the
matter
when
he
picked
up
the
paper
the
next
morning
however
he
was
surprised
to
find
that
only
a
few
lines
had
been
given
to
the
case
and
that
his
interview
had
been
replaced
by
one
with
an
unnamed
official
of
the
fidelity
to
the
effect
that
the
attack
upon
the
company
was
obviously
for
purposes
that
was
the
only
ripple
which
montague
work
produced
upon
the
surface
of
the
pool
but
there
was
a
great
commotion
among
the
fish
at
the
bottom
about
which
he
was
soon
to
learn
that
evening
while
he
was
hard
at
work
in
his
study
he
received
a
telephone
call
from
his
brother
i
coming
round
to
see
you
said
oliver
wait
for
me
all
right
said
the
other
and
added
i
thought
you
were
dining
at
the
wallings
i
there
now
was
the
answer
i
leaving
what
is
the
matter
montague
asked
there
hell
to
pay
was
the
reply
and
then
silence
when
oliver
appeared
a
few
minutes
later
he
did
not
even
stop
to
set
down
his
hat
but
exclaimed
allan
what
in
heaven
name
have
you
been
doing
what
do
you
mean
asked
the
other
why
that
suit
what
about
it
good
god
man
cried
oliver
do
you
mean
that
you
really
do
know
what
you
done
montague
was
staring
at
him
i
afraid
i
do
said
he
why
you
turning
the
world
upside
down
exclaimed
the
other
everybody
you
know
is
crazy
about
it
everybody
i
know
echoed
montague
what
have
they
to
do
with
it
why
you
stabbed
them
in
the
back
half
shouted
oliver
i
could
hardly
believe
my
ears
when
they
told
me
robbie
walling
is
simply
wild
i
never
had
such
a
time
in
my
life
i
do
understand
yet
said
montague
more
and
more
amazed
what
has
he
to
do
with
it
why
man
cried
oliver
his
brother
a
director
in
the
fidelity
and
his
own
interests
and
all
the
other
companies
you
struck
at
the
whole
insurance
business
montague
caught
his
breath
oh
i
see
he
said
how
could
you
think
of
such
a
thing
cried
the
other
wildly
you
promised
to
consult
me
about
things
i
told
you
when
i
took
this
case
put
in
montague
quickly
i
know
said
his
brother
but
you
did
explain
and
what
did
i
know
about
it
i
thought
i
could
leave
it
to
your
common
sense
not
to
mix
up
in
a
thing
like
this
i
very
sorry
said
montague
gravely
i
had
no
idea
of
any
such
result
that
what
i
told
robbie
said
oliver
good
god
what
a
time
i
had
he
took
his
hat
and
coat
and
laid
them
on
the
bed
and
sat
down
and
began
to
tell
about
it
i
made
him
realize
the
disadvantage
you
were
under
he
said
being
a
stranger
and
not
knowing
the
ground
i
believe
he
had
an
idea
that
you
tried
to
get
his
confidence
on
purpose
to
attack
him
it
was
robbie
i
guess
you
know
her
fortune
is
all
in
that
quarter
oliver
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
forehead
my
he
and
fancy
what
old
wyman
must
be
saying
about
this
and
what
a
time
poor
betty
must
be
having
and
then
freddie
vandam
the
air
will
be
blue
for
half
a
mile
round
his
place
i
must
send
him
a
wire
and
explain
that
it
was
a
mistake
and
that
we
getting
out
of
it
and
he
got
up
to
suit
the
action
to
the
word
but
to
the
desk
he
heard
his
brother
say
wait
he
turned
and
saw
montague
quite
pale
i
suppose
by
out
of
it
said
the
latter
you
mean
dropping
the
case
of
course
was
the
answer
well
then
he
continued
very
gravely
i
can
see
that
it
going
to
be
hard
and
i
sorry
but
you
might
as
well
understand
me
at
the
very
beginning
i
will
never
drop
this
case
oliver
jaw
fell
limp
allan
he
gasped
there
was
a
silence
and
then
the
storm
broke
oliver
knew
his
brother
well
enough
to
realize
just
how
thoroughly
he
meant
what
he
said
and
so
he
got
the
full
force
of
the
shock
all
at
once
he
raved
and
swore
and
wrung
his
hands
and
declaimed
at
his
brother
saying
that
he
had
betrayed
him
that
he
was
ruining
him
dumping
himself
and
the
whole
family
into
the
ditch
they
would
be
jeered
at
and
insulted
they
would
be
blacklisted
and
thrown
out
of
society
alice
career
would
be
cut
short
every
door
would
be
closed
to
her
his
own
career
would
die
before
it
was
born
he
would
never
get
into
the
clubs
he
would
be
a
pariah
he
would
be
bankrupted
and
penniless
again
and
again
oliver
went
over
the
situation
naming
person
after
person
who
would
be
outraged
and
describing
what
that
person
would
do
there
were
the
wallings
and
the
venables
and
the
havens
the
vandams
and
the
todds
and
the
wymans
they
were
all
one
regiment
and
montague
had
flung
a
bomb
into
the
centre
of
them
it
was
very
terrible
to
him
to
see
his
brother
rage
and
despair
but
he
had
seen
his
way
clear
through
this
matter
and
he
knew
that
there
was
no
turning
back
for
him
it
is
painful
to
learn
that
all
acquaintances
are
thieves
he
said
but
that
does
not
change
my
opinion
of
stealing
but
my
god
cried
oliver
did
you
come
to
new
york
to
preach
sermons
to
which
the
other
answered
i
came
to
practise
law
and
the
lawyer
who
will
not
fight
injustice
is
a
traitor
to
his
profession
oliver
threw
up
his
hands
in
despair
what
could
one
say
to
a
sentiment
such
as
that
but
then
again
he
came
to
the
charge
pointing
out
to
his
brother
the
position
in
which
he
had
placed
himself
with
the
wallings
he
had
accepted
their
hospitality
they
had
taken
him
and
alice
in
and
done
everything
in
the
world
for
them
things
for
which
no
money
could
ever
repay
them
and
now
he
had
struck
them
but
the
only
effect
of
that
was
to
make
montague
regret
that
he
had
ever
had
anything
to
do
with
the
wallings
if
they
expected
to
use
their
friendship
to
tie
his
hands
in
such
a
matter
they
were
people
he
would
have
left
alone
but
do
you
realize
that
it
not
merely
yourself
you
ruining
cried
oliver
do
you
know
what
you
doing
to
alice
that
is
harder
yet
for
me
the
other
replied
but
i
am
sure
that
alice
would
not
ask
me
to
stop
montague
was
firmly
set
in
his
own
mind
but
it
seemed
to
be
quite
impossible
for
his
brother
to
realize
that
this
was
the
case
he
would
give
up
but
then
going
back
into
his
own
mind
and
facing
the
thought
of
this
person
and
that
and
the
impossibility
of
the
situation
which
would
arise
he
would
return
to
the
attack
with
new
anguish
in
his
voice
he
implored
and
scolded
and
even
wept
and
then
he
would
get
himself
together
again
and
come
and
sit
in
front
of
his
brother
and
try
to
reason
with
him
and
so
it
was
that
in
the
small
hours
of
the
morning
montague
pale
and
nervous
but
quite
unshaken
was
sitting
and
listening
while
his
brother
unfolded
before
him
a
picture
of
the
metropolis
as
he
had
come
to
see
it
it
was
a
city
ruled
by
mighty
forces
great
families
and
fortunes
which
had
held
their
sway
for
generations
and
regarded
the
place
with
all
its
swarming
millions
as
their
birthright
they
possessed
it
utterly
they
held
it
in
the
hollow
of
their
hands
railroads
and
telegraphs
and
telephones
banks
and
insurance
and
trust
companies
all
these
they
owned
and
the
political
machines
and
the
legislatures
the
courts
and
the
newspapers
the
churches
and
the
colleges
and
their
rule
was
for
plunder
all
the
streams
of
profit
ran
into
their
coffers
the
stranger
who
came
to
their
city
succeeded
as
he
helped
them
in
their
purposes
and
failed
if
they
could
not
use
him
a
great
editor
or
bishop
was
a
man
who
taught
their
doctrines
a
great
statesman
was
a
man
who
made
the
laws
for
them
a
great
lawyer
was
one
who
helped
them
to
outwit
the
public
any
man
who
dared
to
oppose
them
they
would
cast
out
and
trample
on
they
would
slander
and
ridicule
and
ruin
and
oliver
came
down
to
particulars
he
named
these
powerful
men
one
after
one
and
showed
what
they
could
do
if
his
brother
would
only
be
a
man
of
the
world
and
see
the
thing
look
at
all
the
successful
lawyers
oliver
named
them
one
after
one
shrewd
devisers
of
corporation
trickery
with
incomes
of
hundreds
of
thousands
a
year
he
could
not
name
the
men
who
had
refused
to
play
the
game
for
no
one
had
ever
heard
of
them
but
it
was
so
evident
what
would
happen
in
this
case
his
friends
would
cast
him
off
his
own
client
would
get
his
price
whatever
it
was
and
then
leave
him
in
the
lurch
and
laugh
at
him
if
you
ca
make
up
your
mind
to
play
the
game
cried
oliver
frantically
at
least
you
can
give
it
up
there
are
plenty
of
other
ways
of
getting
a
living
if
you
let
me
i
take
care
of
you
myself
rather
than
have
you
disgrace
me
tell
me
will
you
do
that
will
you
quit
altogether
and
montague
suddenly
leaped
to
his
feet
and
brought
his
fist
down
upon
the
desk
with
a
bang
no
he
cried
by
god
no
let
me
make
you
understand
me
once
for
all
he
rushed
on
shown
me
new
york
as
you
see
it
i
do
believe
it
the
truth
i
do
believe
it
for
one
single
moment
but
let
me
tell
you
this
i
shall
stay
here
and
find
out
and
if
it
is
true
it
wo
stop
me
i
shall
stay
here
and
defy
those
people
i
shall
stay
and
fight
them
till
the
day
i
die
they
may
ruin
me
i
go
and
live
in
a
garret
if
i
have
to
but
as
sure
as
there
a
god
that
made
me
i
never
stop
till
i
opened
the
eyes
of
the
people
to
what
they
doing
montague
towered
over
his
brother
and
terrible
oliver
shrank
from
him
he
never
had
seen
such
a
burst
of
wrath
from
him
before
do
you
understand
me
now
montague
cried
and
he
answered
in
a
despairing
voice
yes
yes
i
see
it
all
up
he
added
weakly
you
and
i
ca
pull
together
no
exclaimed
the
other
passionately
we
ca
and
we
might
as
well
give
up
trying
you
have
chosen
to
be
a
and
a
and
i
do
choose
it
do
you
think
i
learned
nothing
in
the
time
i
been
here
why
man
you
used
to
be
daring
and
clever
and
now
you
never
draw
a
breath
without
wondering
if
these
rich
snobs
will
like
the
way
you
do
it
and
you
want
alice
to
sell
herself
to
them
you
want
me
to
sell
my
career
to
them
there
was
a
long
pause
oliver
had
turned
very
pale
and
then
suddenly
his
brother
caught
himself
together
and
said
i
sorry
i
mean
to
quarrel
but
you
goaded
me
too
much
i
grateful
for
what
you
have
tried
to
do
for
me
and
i
pay
you
back
as
soon
as
i
can
but
i
ca
go
on
with
this
game
i
quit
and
you
can
disown
me
to
your
friends
tell
them
that
i
run
amuck
and
to
forget
they
ever
knew
me
they
hardly
blame
you
for
it
they
know
you
too
well
for
that
and
as
for
alice
i
talk
it
out
with
her
and
let
her
decide
for
herself
if
she
wants
to
be
a
society
queen
she
can
put
herself
in
your
hands
and
i
get
out
of
her
way
on
the
other
hand
if
she
approves
of
what
i
doing
why
we
both
quit
and
you
have
to
bother
with
either
of
us
that
was
the
basis
upon
which
they
parted
for
the
night
but
like
most
resolutions
taken
at
white
heat
it
was
not
followed
literally
it
was
very
hard
for
montague
to
have
to
confront
alice
with
such
a
choice
and
as
for
oliver
when
he
went
home
and
thought
it
over
he
began
to
discover
gleams
of
hope
he
might
make
it
clear
to
every
one
that
he
was
not
responsible
for
his
brother
business
vagaries
and
take
his
chances
upon
that
basis
after
all
there
were
wheels
within
wheels
in
society
and
if
the
robbie
wallings
chose
to
break
with
him
why
they
had
plenty
of
enemies
there
might
even
be
interests
which
would
be
benefited
by
allan
course
and
would
take
him
up
montague
had
resolved
to
write
and
break
every
engagement
which
he
had
made
and
to
sever
his
connection
with
society
at
one
stroke
but
the
next
day
his
brother
came
again
with
compromises
and
new
protestations
there
was
no
use
going
to
the
other
extreme
he
oliver
would
have
it
out
with
the
wallings
and
they
might
all
go
on
their
way
as
if
nothing
had
happened
so
montague
made
his
début
in
the
rôle
of
he
went
with
many
qualms
and
misgivings
uncertain
how
each
new
person
would
take
it
the
next
evening
he
was
promised
for
a
with
siegfried
harvey
and
they
had
supper
in
a
private
room
at
delmonico
and
there
came
winnie
resplendent
as
an
apple
tree
in
early
april
and
murmuring
with
bated
breath
oh
you
dreadful
man
what
have
you
been
doing
have
i
been
poaching
on
your
preserves
he
asked
promptly
no
not
mine
she
said
but
and
then
she
hesitated
on
mr
duval
he
asked
no
she
said
not
his
but
everybody
else
he
was
telling
me
about
it
there
a
most
dreadful
uproar
he
wanted
me
to
try
to
find
out
what
you
were
up
to
and
who
was
behind
it
montague
listened
wonderingly
did
winnie
mean
to
imply
that
her
husband
had
asked
her
to
try
to
worm
his
business
secrets
out
of
him
that
was
what
she
seemed
to
imply
i
told
him
i
never
talked
business
with
my
friends
she
said
he
can
ask
you
himself
if
he
chooses
but
what
does
it
all
mean
anyhow
montague
smiled
at
the
naive
inconsistency
it
means
nothing
said
he
except
that
i
am
trying
to
get
justice
for
a
client
but
can
you
afford
to
make
so
many
powerful
enemies
she
asked
i
taken
my
chances
on
that
he
replied
winnie
answered
nothing
but
looked
at
him
with
wondering
admiration
in
her
eyes
you
arc
different
from
the
men
about
you
she
remarked
after
a
her
tone
gave
montague
to
understand
that
there
was
one
person
who
meant
to
stand
by
him
but
winnie
duval
was
not
all
society
montague
was
amused
to
notice
with
what
suddenness
the
stream
of
invitations
slacked
up
it
was
necessary
for
alice
to
give
her
calling
list
many
revisions
freddie
vandam
had
promised
to
invite
them
to
his
place
on
long
island
and
of
course
that
invitation
would
never
come
likewise
they
would
never
again
see
the
palace
of
the
lester
todds
upon
the
jersey
oliver
put
in
the
next
few
days
in
calling
upon
people
to
explain
his
embarrassing
situation
he
washed
his
hands
of
his
brother
affairs
he
said
and
his
friends
might
do
the
same
if
they
saw
fit
with
the
robbie
wallings
he
had
a
stormy
half
hour
about
which
he
thought
it
best
to
say
little
to
the
rest
of
the
family
robbie
did
not
break
with
him
utterly
because
of
their
wall
street
alliance
but
feeling
was
so
bitter
he
said
that
it
would
be
best
if
alice
saw
nothing
of
her
for
a
while
he
had
a
long
talk
with
alice
and
explained
the
situation
the
girl
was
utterly
dumbfounded
for
she
was
deeply
grateful
to
robbie
and
fond
of
her
as
well
and
she
could
not
believe
that
a
friend
could
be
so
cruelly
unjust
to
her
the
upshot
of
the
whole
situation
was
a
very
painful
episode
a
few
days
later
alice
met
robbie
at
a
reception
and
she
took
the
lady
aside
and
tried
to
tell
her
how
distressed
and
helpless
she
was
and
the
result
was
that
robbie
flew
into
a
passion
and
railed
at
her
declaring
in
the
presence
of
several
people
that
she
had
sponged
upon
her
and
abused
her
hospitality
and
so
poor
alice
came
home
weeping
and
half
hysterical
all
of
which
of
course
was
like
oil
upon
a
fire
the
heavens
were
lighted
up
with
the
conflagration
the
next
development
was
a
paragraph
in
society
telling
with
infinite
gusto
how
a
certain
matron
had
taken
up
a
family
of
stranded
waifs
from
a
far
state
and
introduced
them
into
the
best
circles
and
even
gone
so
far
as
to
give
a
magnificent
dance
in
their
honour
and
how
the
discovery
had
been
made
that
the
head
of
the
family
had
been
secretly
preparing
an
attack
upon
their
business
interests
and
of
the
tearing
of
hair
and
gnashing
of
teeth
which
had
followed
and
the
violent
quarrel
in
a
public
place
the
paragraph
concluded
with
the
prediction
that
the
strangers
would
find
themselves
the
centre
of
a
merry
social
war
oliver
was
the
first
to
show
them
this
paper
but
lest
by
any
chance
they
should
miss
it
half
a
dozen
unknown
friends
were
good
enough
to
mail
them
copies
carefully
and
then
came
reggie
mann
who
as
and
sat
on
the
fence
and
watched
the
fun
reggie
wore
a
thin
veil
of
sympathy
over
his
naked
glee
and
brought
them
the
latest
reports
from
all
portions
of
the
thus
they
were
able
to
know
exactly
what
everybody
was
saying
about
them
who
was
amused
and
who
was
outraged
and
who
proposed
to
drop
them
and
who
to
take
them
up
montague
listened
for
a
while
but
then
he
got
tired
of
it
and
went
for
a
walk
to
escape
it
but
only
to
run
into
another
trap
it
was
dark
and
he
was
strolling
down
the
avenue
when
out
of
a
brilliantly
lighted
jewellery
shop
came
billy
alden
to
her
carriage
and
she
hailed
him
with
an
exclamation
you
man
she
cried
what
have
you
been
doing
he
tried
to
laugh
it
off
and
escape
but
she
took
him
by
the
arm
commanding
get
in
here
and
tell
me
about
it
so
he
found
himself
moving
with
the
slow
stream
of
vehicles
on
the
avenue
and
with
billy
gazing
at
him
quizzically
and
asking
him
if
he
did
not
feel
like
a
hippopotamus
in
a
he
replied
to
her
raillery
by
asking
her
under
which
flag
she
stood
but
there
was
little
need
to
ask
that
for
anyone
who
was
fighting
a
walling
became
ipso
facto
a
friend
of
billy
she
told
montague
that
if
he
felt
his
social
position
was
imperilled
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
come
to
her
she
would
gird
on
her
armour
and
take
the
field
but
tell
me
how
you
came
to
do
it
she
said
he
answered
that
there
was
very
little
to
tell
he
had
taken
up
a
case
which
was
obviously
just
but
having
no
idea
what
a
storm
it
would
raise
then
he
noticed
that
his
companion
was
looking
at
him
sharply
do
you
really
mean
that
all
there
is
to
it
she
asked
of
course
i
do
said
he
perplexed
do
you
know
was
her
unexpected
response
i
hardly
know
what
to
make
of
you
i
afraid
to
trust
you
on
account
of
your
brother
montague
was
embarrassed
i
do
know
what
you
mean
he
said
everybody
thinks
there
some
trickery
in
that
suit
she
answered
oh
said
montague
i
see
well
they
will
find
out
if
it
will
help
you
any
to
know
it
i
been
having
no
end
of
scenes
with
my
brother
i
believe
you
said
billy
genially
but
it
seems
strange
that
a
man
could
have
been
so
blind
to
a
situation
i
feel
quite
ashamed
because
i
did
help
you
myself
the
carriage
had
stopped
at
billy
home
and
she
asked
him
to
dinner
there
be
nobody
but
my
brother
she
said
we
resting
this
evening
and
i
can
make
up
to
you
for
my
negligence
montague
had
no
engagement
and
so
he
went
in
and
saw
mansion
which
was
decorated
in
imitation
of
a
doge
palace
and
met
davy
alden
a
little
gentleman
who
obeyed
orders
promptly
they
had
a
comfortable
dinner
of
courses
and
then
retired
to
the
where
billy
sank
into
a
huge
easy
chair
with
a
decanter
of
whisky
and
some
cracked
ice
in
readiness
beside
it
then
from
a
tray
she
selected
a
thick
black
cigar
and
placidly
bit
off
the
end
and
lighted
it
and
then
settled
back
at
her
ease
and
proceeded
to
tell
montague
about
new
york
and
about
the
great
families
who
ruled
it
and
where
and
how
they
had
got
their
money
and
who
were
their
allies
and
who
their
enemies
and
what
particular
skeletons
were
hidden
in
each
of
their
closets
it
was
worth
coming
a
long
way
to
listen
to
billy
her
thoughts
were
vigorous
and
her
imagery
was
picturesque
she
spoke
of
old
dan
waterman
and
described
him
as
a
wild
boar
rooting
chestnuts
he
was
all
right
she
said
if
you
did
come
under
his
tree
and
montague
asked
which
is
his
tree
and
she
answered
any
one
he
happens
to
be
under
at
the
time
and
then
she
came
to
the
wallings
billy
had
been
in
on
the
inside
of
that
family
and
there
was
nothing
she
did
know
about
it
and
she
brought
the
members
up
one
by
one
and
dissected
them
and
exhibited
them
for
montague
benefit
they
were
typical
bourgeois
people
she
said
they
were
burghers
they
had
never
shown
the
least
capacity
for
refinement
they
ate
and
drank
and
jostled
other
people
out
of
the
way
the
old
ones
had
been
boors
and
the
new
ones
were
cads
and
billy
sat
and
puffed
at
her
cigar
do
you
know
the
history
of
the
family
she
asked
the
founder
was
a
rough
old
ferryman
he
fought
his
rivals
so
well
that
in
the
end
he
owned
all
the
boats
and
then
some
one
discovered
the
idea
of
buying
legislatures
and
building
railroads
and
he
went
into
that
it
was
a
time
when
they
simply
grabbed
things
if
you
ever
look
into
it
you
find
they
making
fortunes
out
of
privileges
that
the
old
man
simply
sat
down
on
and
held
there
a
bridge
at
albany
for
instance
to
which
they
have
the
slightest
right
my
brother
knows
about
it
they
given
themselves
a
contract
with
their
railroad
by
which
they
paid
for
every
passenger
and
their
profit
every
year
is
greater
than
the
cost
of
the
bridge
the
son
was
the
head
of
the
family
when
i
came
in
and
i
found
that
he
had
it
all
arranged
to
leave
thirty
million
dollars
to
one
of
his
sons
and
only
ten
million
to
my
husband
i
set
to
work
to
change
that
i
can
tell
you
i
used
to
go
around
to
see
him
and
scratch
his
back
and
tickle
him
and
make
him
feel
good
of
course
the
family
went
wild
my
how
they
hated
me
they
set
old
ellis
to
work
to
keep
me
off
have
you
met
judge
ellis
i
have
said
montague
well
there
a
old
hypocrite
for
you
said
billy
in
those
days
he
was
walling
business
lackey
used
to
pass
the
money
to
the
legislators
and
keep
the
wheels
of
the
machine
greased
one
of
the
first
things
i
said
to
the
old
man
was
that
i
did
ask
him
to
entertain
my
butler
and
he
must
ask
me
to
entertain
his
valet
and
so
i
forbid
ellis
to
enter
my
house
and
when
i
found
that
he
was
trying
to
get
between
the
old
man
and
me
i
flew
into
a
rage
and
boxed
his
ears
and
chased
him
out
of
the
room
billy
paused
and
laughed
heartily
over
the
recollection
of
course
that
tickled
the
old
man
to
death
she
continued
the
wallings
never
could
make
out
how
i
managed
to
get
round
him
as
i
did
but
it
was
simply
because
i
was
honest
with
him
they
come
snivelling
round
pretending
they
were
anxious
about
his
health
while
i
wanted
his
money
and
i
told
him
so
the
valiant
lady
turned
to
the
decanter
have
some
scotch
she
asked
and
poured
some
for
herself
and
then
went
on
with
her
story
when
i
first
came
to
new
york
she
said
the
rich
people
houses
were
all
alike
all
dreary
brownstone
fronts
sandwiched
in
on
one
or
two
city
lots
i
vowed
that
i
would
have
a
house
with
some
room
all
around
it
and
that
was
the
beginning
of
those
palaces
that
all
new
york
walks
by
and
stares
at
you
can
hardly
believe
it
now
those
houses
were
a
scandal
but
the
sensation
tickled
the
old
man
i
remember
one
day
we
walked
up
the
avenue
to
see
how
they
were
coming
on
and
he
pointed
with
his
big
stick
to
the
second
floor
and
asked
that
i
answered
a
safe
i
building
into
the
house
that
was
a
new
thing
too
in
those
days
going
to
keep
my
money
in
that
i
said
he
growled
you
done
with
this
house
you
have
any
money
left
planning
to
make
you
fill
it
for
me
i
answered
and
do
you
know
he
chuckled
all
the
way
home
over
it
billy
sat
laughing
softly
to
herself
we
had
great
old
battles
in
those
days
she
said
among
other
things
i
had
to
put
the
wallings
into
society
they
were
sneaking
round
on
the
outside
when
i
came
licking
people
boots
and
expecting
to
be
kicked
i
said
to
myself
i
put
an
end
to
that
we
have
a
so
i
gave
a
ball
that
made
the
whole
country
sit
up
and
gasp
it
would
be
noticed
particularly
nowadays
but
then
people
had
never
dreamed
of
anything
so
gorgeous
and
i
made
out
a
list
of
all
the
people
i
wanted
to
know
in
new
york
and
i
said
to
myself
you
come
you
a
friend
and
if
you
do
come
you
an
enemy
and
they
all
came
let
me
tell
you
and
there
was
never
any
question
about
the
wallings
being
in
society
after
that
billy
halted
and
montague
remarked
with
a
smile
that
doubtless
she
was
sorry
now
that
she
had
done
it
oh
no
she
answered
with
a
shrug
of
her
shoulders
i
find
that
all
i
have
to
do
is
to
be
patient
i
hate
people
and
think
i
like
to
poison
them
but
if
i
only
wait
long
enough
something
happens
to
them
much
worse
than
i
ever
dreamed
of
you
be
revenged
on
the
robbies
some
day
i
do
want
any
revenge
montague
answered
i
no
quarrel
with
them
i
simply
wish
i
had
accepted
their
hospitality
i
did
know
they
were
such
little
people
it
seems
hard
to
believe
it
billy
laughed
cynically
what
could
you
expect
she
said
they
know
there
nothing
to
them
but
their
money
when
that
gone
gone
they
could
never
make
any
more
the
lady
gave
a
chuckle
and
added
those
words
make
me
think
of
davy
experience
when
he
wanted
to
go
to
congress
tell
him
about
it
davy
but
alden
did
not
warm
to
the
subject
he
left
the
tale
to
his
sister
he
was
a
democrat
you
know
said
she
and
he
went
to
the
boss
and
told
him
he
like
to
go
to
congress
the
answer
was
that
it
would
cost
him
forty
thousand
dollars
and
he
kicked
at
the
price
others
have
to
put
up
such
sums
he
said
why
should
he
and
the
old
man
growled
at
him
rest
have
other
things
to
give
one
can
deliver
the
another
is
paid
for
by
a
corporation
but
what
can
you
do
what
is
there
to
you
but
your
money
so
davy
paid
the
money
did
you
davy
and
davy
grinned
sheepishly
even
so
she
went
on
he
came
off
better
than
poor
devon
they
got
fifty
thousand
out
of
him
and
sold
him
out
and
he
never
got
to
congress
after
all
that
was
just
before
he
concluded
that
america
was
a
fit
place
for
a
gentleman
to
live
in
and
so
billy
got
started
on
the
devons
and
after
that
came
the
havens
and
the
wymans
and
the
todds
it
was
midnight
before
she
got
through
with
them
all
chapter
xviii
the
newspapers
said
nothing
more
about
the
hasbrook
suit
but
in
financial
circles
montague
had
attained
considerable
notoriety
because
of
it
and
this
was
the
means
of
bringing
him
a
number
of
new
cases
but
alas
there
were
no
more
clients
the
first
caller
was
a
destitute
widow
with
a
deed
which
would
have
entitled
her
to
the
greater
part
of
a
large
city
in
pennsylvania
only
unfortunately
the
deed
was
about
eighty
years
old
and
then
there
was
a
poor
old
man
who
had
been
hurt
in
a
accident
and
had
been
tricked
into
signing
away
his
rights
and
an
indignant
citizen
who
proposed
to
bring
a
hundred
suits
against
the
traction
trust
for
transfers
refused
all
were
contingency
cases
with
the
chances
of
success
exceedingly
remote
and
montague
noticed
that
the
people
had
come
to
him
as
a
last
resort
having
apparently
heard
of
him
as
a
man
of
altruistic
temper
there
was
one
case
which
interested
him
particularly
because
it
seemed
to
fit
in
so
ominously
with
the
grim
prognosis
of
his
brother
he
received
a
call
from
an
elderly
gentleman
of
very
evident
refinement
and
dignity
of
manner
who
proceeded
to
unfold
to
him
a
most
amazing
story
five
or
six
years
ago
he
had
invented
a
which
was
the
most
efficient
known
he
had
organised
a
company
with
three
million
dollars
capital
to
manufacture
it
himself
taking
a
third
interest
for
his
patents
and
becoming
president
of
the
company
not
long
afterward
had
come
a
proposal
from
a
group
of
men
who
wished
to
organize
a
company
to
manufacture
automobiles
they
proposed
to
form
an
alliance
which
would
give
them
the
exclusive
use
of
the
battery
but
these
men
were
not
people
with
whom
the
inventor
cared
to
deal
they
were
traction
and
gas
magnates
widely
known
for
their
unscrupulous
methods
and
so
he
had
declined
their
offer
and
set
to
work
instead
to
organize
an
automobile
company
himself
he
had
just
got
under
way
when
he
discovered
that
his
rivals
had
set
to
work
to
take
his
invention
away
from
him
a
friend
who
owned
another
third
share
in
his
company
had
hypothecated
his
stock
to
help
form
the
new
company
and
now
came
a
call
from
the
bank
for
more
collateral
and
he
was
obliged
to
sell
out
and
at
the
next
stockholders
meeting
it
developed
that
their
rivals
had
bought
it
and
likewise
more
stock
in
the
open
market
and
they
proceeded
to
take
possession
of
the
company
ousting
the
former
president
and
then
making
a
contract
with
their
automobile
company
to
furnish
the
at
a
price
which
left
no
profit
for
the
manufacturers
and
so
for
two
years
the
inventor
had
not
received
a
dollar
of
dividends
upon
his
million
dollars
worth
of
paper
and
to
cap
the
climax
the
company
had
refused
to
sell
the
battery
to
his
automobile
company
and
so
that
had
gone
into
bankruptcy
and
his
friend
was
ruined
also
montague
went
into
the
case
very
carefully
and
found
that
the
story
was
true
what
interested
him
particularly
in
it
was
the
fact
that
he
had
met
a
couple
of
these
financial
highwaymen
in
social
life
he
had
come
to
know
the
son
and
heir
of
one
of
them
quite
well
at
siegfried
harvey
this
gilded
youth
was
engaged
to
be
married
in
a
very
few
days
and
the
papers
had
it
that
the
had
presented
the
bride
with
a
cheque
for
a
million
dollars
montague
could
not
but
wonder
if
it
was
the
million
that
had
been
taken
from
his
client
there
was
to
be
a
bachelor
dinner
at
the
millionaires
on
the
night
before
the
wedding
to
which
he
and
oliver
had
been
invited
as
he
was
thinking
of
taking
up
his
case
he
went
to
his
brother
saying
that
he
wished
to
decline
but
oliver
had
been
getting
back
his
courage
day
by
day
and
declared
that
it
was
more
important
than
ever
now
that
he
should
hold
his
ground
and
face
his
enemies
for
alice
sake
if
not
for
his
own
and
so
montague
went
to
the
dinner
and
saw
deeper
yet
into
the
history
of
the
stolen
millions
it
was
a
very
beautiful
affair
in
the
beginning
there
was
a
large
private
elaborately
decorated
with
a
string
orchestra
concealed
in
a
bower
of
plants
but
there
were
cocktails
even
on
the
at
the
doorway
and
by
the
time
the
guests
had
got
to
the
coffee
every
one
was
hilariously
drunk
after
each
toast
they
would
hurl
their
glasses
over
their
shoulders
the
purpose
of
a
bachelor
dinner
it
appeared
was
a
farewell
to
the
old
days
and
the
boon
companions
so
there
were
sentimental
and
comic
songs
which
had
been
composed
for
the
occasion
and
were
received
with
whirlwinds
of
laughter
by
listening
closely
and
reading
between
the
lines
one
might
get
quite
a
history
of
the
young
host
adventurous
career
there
was
a
house
up
on
the
west
side
and
there
was
a
yacht
with
orgies
in
every
part
of
the
world
there
was
the
summer
night
in
newport
harbour
when
some
one
had
hit
upon
the
dazzling
scheme
of
freezing
gold
pieces
in
tiny
blocks
of
ice
to
be
dropped
down
the
girls
backs
and
there
was
a
banquet
in
a
studio
in
new
york
when
a
huge
pie
had
been
brought
on
from
which
a
girl
had
emerged
with
a
flock
of
canary
birds
about
her
then
there
was
a
damsel
who
had
been
wont
to
dance
upon
the
tops
of
supper
tables
clad
in
diaphanous
costume
and
who
had
got
drunk
after
a
and
set
out
to
smash
up
a
broadway
restaurant
there
was
a
cousin
from
chicago
a
wild
lad
who
made
a
speciality
of
this
diversion
and
whose
mistresses
were
bathed
in
apparently
there
were
numberless
places
in
the
city
where
such
orgies
were
carried
on
continually
there
were
private
clubs
and
artists
studios
there
were
several
allusions
to
a
high
tower
which
montague
did
not
comprehend
many
such
matters
however
were
explained
to
him
by
an
elderly
gentleman
who
sat
on
his
right
and
who
seemed
to
stay
sober
no
matter
how
much
he
drank
incidentally
he
gravely
advised
montague
to
meet
one
of
the
young
host
mistresses
who
was
a
stunning
girl
and
was
in
the
market
toward
morning
the
festivities
changed
to
a
series
of
the
young
men
stripped
off
their
clothing
and
tore
the
table
to
pieces
and
piled
it
out
of
the
way
in
a
corner
smashing
most
of
the
crockery
in
the
process
between
the
matches
champagne
would
be
opened
by
knocking
off
the
heads
of
the
bottles
and
this
went
on
until
four
in
the
morning
when
many
of
the
guests
were
lying
in
heaps
upon
the
floor
montague
rode
home
in
a
cab
with
the
elderly
gentleman
who
had
sat
next
to
him
and
on
the
way
he
asked
if
such
affairs
as
this
were
common
and
his
companion
who
was
a
steel
man
from
the
west
replied
by
telling
him
of
some
which
he
had
witnessed
at
home
at
siegfried
harvey
montague
had
seen
a
popular
actress
in
a
musical
comedy
which
was
then
the
most
successful
play
running
in
new
york
the
house
was
sold
out
weeks
ahead
and
after
the
matinee
you
might
observe
the
street
in
front
of
the
blocked
by
people
waiting
to
see
the
woman
come
out
she
was
lithe
and
supple
like
a
panther
and
wore
gowns
to
reveal
her
form
it
seemed
that
her
play
must
have
been
built
with
one
purpose
in
mind
to
see
how
much
lewdness
could
be
put
upon
a
stage
without
interference
by
the
and
now
his
companion
told
him
how
this
woman
had
been
invited
to
sing
at
a
banquet
given
by
the
magnates
of
a
mighty
trust
and
had
gone
after
midnight
to
the
most
exclusive
club
in
the
town
and
sung
her
popular
ditty
wo
you
come
and
play
with
me
the
merry
magnates
had
taken
the
invitation
literally
with
the
result
that
the
actress
had
escaped
from
the
room
with
half
her
clothing
torn
off
her
and
a
little
while
later
an
official
of
this
trust
had
wished
to
get
rid
of
his
wife
and
marry
a
and
when
public
clamour
had
forced
the
directors
to
ask
him
to
resign
he
had
replied
by
threatening
to
tell
about
this
banquet
the
next
day
or
rather
to
be
precise
that
same
morning
montague
and
alice
attended
the
gorgeous
wedding
it
was
declared
by
the
newspapers
to
be
the
most
important
social
event
of
the
week
and
it
took
half
a
dozen
policemen
to
hold
back
the
crowds
which
filled
the
street
the
ceremony
took
place
at
cecilia
with
the
stately
bishop
officiating
in
his
purple
and
scarlet
robes
inside
the
doors
were
all
the
elect
exquisitely
groomed
and
gowned
and
such
a
medley
of
delicious
perfumes
as
not
all
the
vales
in
arcady
could
equal
the
groom
had
been
polished
and
scrubbed
and
looked
very
handsome
though
somewhat
pale
and
montague
could
not
but
smile
as
he
observed
the
best
man
looking
so
very
solemn
and
recollected
the
drunken
wrestler
of
a
few
hours
before
staggering
about
in
a
pale
blue
undershirt
ripped
up
the
back
the
montagues
knew
by
this
time
whom
they
were
to
avoid
they
were
graciously
taken
under
the
wing
of
eldridge
devon
whose
real
estate
was
not
affected
by
insurance
suits
and
the
next
morning
they
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
their
names
in
the
list
of
those
present
and
even
a
couple
of
lines
about
alice
costume
alice
was
always
referred
to
as
miss
montague
it
was
very
pleasant
to
be
the
miss
montague
and
to
think
of
all
the
other
miss
montagues
in
the
city
who
were
thereby
haughtily
rebuked
in
the
yellow
papers
there
were
also
accounts
of
the
trousseau
of
the
bride
and
of
the
wonderful
gifts
which
she
had
received
and
of
the
long
honeymoon
which
she
was
to
spend
in
the
mediterranean
upon
her
husband
yacht
montague
found
himself
wondering
if
the
ghosts
of
its
former
occupants
would
not
haunt
her
and
whether
she
would
have
been
as
happy
had
she
known
as
much
as
he
knew
he
found
food
for
a
good
deal
of
thought
in
the
memory
of
this
banquet
among
the
things
which
he
had
gathered
from
the
songs
was
a
hint
that
oliver
also
had
some
secrets
which
he
had
not
seen
fit
to
tell
his
brother
the
keeping
of
young
girls
was
apparently
one
of
the
established
customs
of
the
little
brothers
of
the
rich
and
for
that
matter
of
many
of
the
big
brothers
also
a
little
later
montague
had
a
curious
glimpse
into
the
life
of
this
he
had
occasion
one
evening
to
call
up
a
certain
financier
whom
he
had
come
to
know
quite
man
of
family
and
a
member
of
the
church
there
were
some
important
papers
to
be
signed
and
sent
off
by
a
steamer
and
the
great
man
secretary
said
that
he
would
try
to
find
him
a
minute
or
two
later
he
called
up
montague
and
asked
him
if
he
would
be
good
enough
to
go
to
an
address
uptown
it
was
a
house
not
far
from
riverside
drive
and
montague
went
there
and
found
his
acquaintance
with
several
other
prominent
men
of
affairs
whom
he
knew
conversing
in
a
with
one
of
the
most
charming
ladies
he
had
ever
met
she
was
exquisite
to
look
at
and
one
of
the
few
people
in
new
york
whom
he
had
found
worth
listening
to
he
spent
such
an
enjoyable
evening
that
when
he
was
leaving
he
remarked
to
the
lady
that
he
would
like
his
cousin
alice
to
meet
her
and
then
he
noticed
that
she
flushed
slightly
and
was
embarrassed
later
on
he
learned
to
his
dismay
that
the
charming
and
beautiful
lady
did
not
go
into
society
nor
was
this
at
all
rare
on
the
contrary
if
one
took
the
trouble
to
make
inquiries
he
would
find
that
such
establishments
were
everywhere
taken
for
granted
montague
talked
about
it
with
major
venable
and
out
of
his
gossip
storehouse
the
old
gentleman
drew
forth
a
string
of
anecdotes
that
made
one
hair
stand
on
end
there
was
one
magnate
who
had
a
passion
for
the
wife
of
a
great
physician
and
he
had
given
a
million
dollars
or
so
to
build
a
hospital
and
had
provided
that
it
should
be
the
finest
in
the
world
and
that
this
physician
should
go
abroad
for
three
years
to
study
the
institutions
of
europe
no
conventions
counted
with
this
old
man
if
he
saw
a
woman
whom
he
wanted
he
would
ask
for
her
and
women
in
society
felt
that
it
was
an
honour
to
be
his
mistress
not
long
after
this
a
man
who
voiced
the
anguish
of
a
mighty
nation
was
turned
out
of
several
hotels
in
new
york
because
he
was
not
married
according
to
the
laws
of
south
dakota
but
this
other
man
would
take
a
woman
to
any
hotel
in
the
city
and
no
one
would
dare
oppose
him
and
there
was
another
a
great
traction
king
who
kept
mistresses
in
chicago
and
paris
and
london
as
well
as
in
new
york
he
had
one
just
around
the
corner
from
his
palatial
home
and
had
an
underground
passage
leading
to
it
and
the
major
told
with
glee
how
he
had
shown
this
to
a
friend
and
the
latter
had
remarked
i
too
stout
to
get
through
there
i
know
it
replied
the
other
else
i
should
have
told
you
and
so
it
went
one
of
the
richest
men
in
new
york
was
a
sexual
degenerate
with
half
a
dozen
women
on
his
hands
all
the
time
he
would
send
them
cheques
and
they
would
use
these
to
blackmail
him
this
man
young
wife
had
been
shut
up
in
a
closet
for
hours
by
her
mother
to
compel
her
to
marry
and
then
there
was
the
charming
tale
of
how
he
had
gone
away
upon
a
mission
of
state
and
had
written
long
messages
full
of
tender
protestations
and
given
them
to
a
newspaper
correspondent
to
cable
home
to
his
wife
the
correspondent
had
thought
it
such
a
touching
example
of
conjugal
devotion
that
he
told
about
it
at
a
when
he
came
back
and
he
was
struck
by
the
sudden
silence
that
fell
the
messages
had
been
sent
to
a
code
address
chuckled
the
major
and
every
one
at
the
table
knew
who
had
got
them
a
few
days
after
this
montague
received
a
telephone
message
from
siegfried
harvey
who
said
that
he
wanted
to
see
him
about
a
matter
of
business
he
asked
him
to
lunch
at
the
noonday
club
and
montague
went
though
not
without
a
qualm
for
it
was
in
the
fidelity
building
the
enemy
bailiwick
a
magnificent
structure
with
halls
of
white
marble
and
a
lavish
display
of
bronze
it
occurred
to
montague
that
somewhere
in
this
structure
people
were
at
work
preparing
an
answer
to
his
charges
he
wondered
what
they
were
saying
the
two
had
lunch
talking
meanwhile
about
the
coming
events
in
society
and
about
politics
and
wars
and
when
the
coffee
was
served
and
they
were
alone
in
the
room
harvey
settled
his
big
frame
back
in
his
chair
and
began
in
the
first
place
he
said
i
must
explain
that
i
something
to
say
that
is
devilish
hard
to
get
into
i
so
much
afraid
of
your
jumping
to
a
wrong
conclusion
in
the
middle
of
it
i
like
you
to
agree
to
listen
for
a
minute
or
two
before
you
think
at
all
all
right
said
montague
with
a
smile
fire
away
and
at
once
the
other
became
grave
you
taken
a
case
against
this
company
he
said
and
ollie
has
talked
enough
to
me
to
make
me
understand
that
you
done
a
plucky
thing
and
that
you
must
be
everlastingly
sick
of
hearing
from
cowardly
people
who
want
you
to
drop
it
i
be
very
sorry
to
be
classed
with
them
for
even
a
moment
and
you
must
understand
at
the
outset
that
i
have
a
particle
of
interest
in
the
company
and
that
it
would
matter
to
me
if
i
had
i
do
try
to
use
my
friends
in
business
and
i
do
let
money
count
with
me
in
my
social
life
i
made
up
my
mind
to
take
the
risk
of
speaking
to
you
about
this
case
simply
because
i
happen
to
know
one
or
two
things
about
it
that
i
thought
you
did
know
and
if
that
so
you
are
at
a
great
disadvantage
but
in
any
case
please
understand
that
i
have
no
motive
but
friendship
and
so
if
i
am
butting
in
excuse
me
when
siegfried
harvey
talked
he
looked
straight
at
one
with
his
clear
blue
eyes
and
there
was
no
doubting
his
honesty
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
said
montague
pray
tell
me
what
you
have
to
say
all
right
said
the
other
it
can
be
done
very
quickly
you
have
taken
a
case
which
involves
a
great
many
sacrifices
upon
your
part
and
i
wondered
if
it
had
ever
occurred
to
you
to
ask
whether
you
might
not
be
taken
advantage
of
how
do
you
mean
asked
montague
do
you
know
the
people
who
are
behind
you
inquired
the
other
do
you
know
them
well
enough
to
be
sure
what
are
their
motives
in
the
case
montague
hesitated
and
thought
no
he
said
i
could
say
that
i
do
then
it
just
as
i
thought
replied
harvey
i
been
watching
you
you
are
an
honest
man
and
you
putting
yourself
to
no
end
of
trouble
from
the
best
of
motives
and
unless
i
mistaken
you
being
used
by
men
who
are
not
honest
and
whom
you
would
work
with
if
you
knew
their
purposes
what
purposes
could
they
have
there
are
several
possibilities
in
the
first
place
it
might
be
a
suit
somebody
who
is
hoping
to
be
bought
off
for
a
big
price
that
is
what
nearly
every
one
thinks
is
the
case
but
i
do
i
think
it
more
likely
some
one
within
the
company
who
is
trying
to
put
the
administration
in
a
hole
who
could
that
be
exclaimed
montague
amazed
i
do
know
that
i
not
familiar
enough
with
the
situation
in
the
fidelity
it
changing
all
the
time
i
simply
know
that
there
are
factions
struggling
for
the
control
of
it
and
hating
each
other
furiously
and
ready
to
do
anything
in
the
world
to
cripple
each
other
you
know
that
their
forty
millions
of
surplus
gives
an
enormous
power
i
rather
be
able
to
swing
forty
millions
in
the
street
than
to
have
ten
millions
in
my
own
right
and
so
the
giants
are
fighting
for
the
control
of
those
companies
and
you
ca
tell
who
in
and
out
you
can
never
know
the
real
meaning
of
anything
that
happens
in
the
struggle
all
that
you
can
be
sure
of
is
that
the
game
is
crooked
from
end
to
end
and
that
nothing
that
happens
in
it
is
what
it
pretends
to
be
montague
listened
half
dazed
and
feeling
as
if
the
ground
he
stood
on
were
caving
beneath
his
feet
what
do
you
know
about
those
who
brought
you
this
case
asked
his
companion
suddenly
not
much
he
said
weakly
harvey
hesitated
a
moment
understand
me
please
he
said
i
no
wish
to
pry
into
your
affairs
and
if
you
do
care
to
say
any
more
i
understand
it
perfectly
but
i
heard
it
said
that
the
man
who
started
the
thing
was
ellis
montague
in
his
turn
hesitated
then
he
said
that
is
correct
between
you
and
me
very
good
said
harvey
and
that
is
what
made
me
suspicious
do
you
know
anything
about
ellis
i
did
said
the
other
i
heard
a
little
since
i
can
fancy
so
said
harvey
and
i
can
tell
you
that
ellis
is
mixed
up
in
matters
in
all
sorts
of
dubious
ways
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
reason
to
be
most
careful
where
you
follow
him
montague
sat
with
his
hands
clenched
and
his
brows
knitted
his
friend
talk
had
been
like
a
flash
of
lightning
it
revealed
huge
menacing
forms
in
the
darkness
about
him
all
the
structure
of
his
hopes
seemed
to
be
tottering
his
case
that
he
had
worked
so
hard
over
his
fifty
thousand
dollars
that
he
had
been
so
proud
of
could
it
be
that
he
had
been
tricked
and
had
made
a
fool
of
himself
how
in
the
world
am
i
to
know
he
cried
that
is
more
than
i
can
tell
said
his
friend
and
for
that
matter
i
not
sure
that
you
could
do
anything
now
all
that
i
could
do
was
to
warn
you
what
sort
of
ground
you
were
treading
on
so
that
you
could
watch
out
for
yourself
in
future
montague
thanked
him
heartily
for
that
service
and
then
he
went
back
to
his
office
and
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
pondering
the
matter
what
he
had
heard
had
made
a
vast
change
in
things
before
it
everything
had
seemed
simple
and
now
nothing
was
clear
he
was
overwhelmed
with
a
sense
of
the
utter
futility
of
his
efforts
he
was
trying
to
build
a
house
upon
quicksands
there
was
nowhere
a
solid
spot
upon
which
he
could
set
his
foot
there
was
nowhere
any
truth
there
were
only
contending
powers
who
used
the
phrases
of
truth
for
their
own
purposes
and
now
he
saw
himself
as
the
world
saw
him
a
party
to
a
piece
of
trickery
a
knave
like
all
the
rest
he
felt
that
he
had
been
tripped
up
at
the
first
step
in
his
career
the
conclusion
of
the
whole
matter
was
that
he
took
an
afternoon
train
for
albany
and
the
next
morning
he
talked
the
matter
out
with
the
judge
montague
had
realized
the
need
of
going
slowly
for
after
all
he
had
no
definite
ground
for
suspicion
and
so
very
tactfully
and
cautiously
he
explained
that
it
had
come
to
his
ears
that
many
people
believed
there
were
interested
parties
behind
the
suit
of
hasbrook
and
that
this
had
made
him
uncomfortable
as
he
knew
nothing
whatever
about
his
client
he
had
come
to
ask
the
judge
advice
in
the
matter
no
one
could
have
taken
the
thing
more
graciously
than
did
the
great
man
he
was
all
kindness
and
tact
in
the
first
place
he
said
he
had
warned
him
in
advance
that
enemies
would
attack
him
and
slander
him
and
that
all
kinds
of
subtle
means
would
be
used
to
influence
him
and
he
must
understand
that
these
rumours
were
part
of
such
a
campaign
it
made
no
difference
how
good
a
friend
had
brought
them
to
him
how
could
he
know
who
had
brought
them
to
that
friend
the
judge
ventured
to
hope
that
nothing
that
anyone
might
say
could
influence
him
to
believe
that
he
the
judge
would
have
advised
him
to
do
anything
improper
no
said
montague
but
can
you
assure
me
that
there
are
no
interested
parties
behind
mr
hasbrook
interested
parties
asked
the
other
i
mean
people
connected
with
the
fidelity
or
other
insurance
companies
why
no
said
the
judge
i
certainly
could
assure
you
of
that
montague
looked
surprised
you
mean
you
do
know
i
mean
was
the
answer
that
i
would
feel
at
liberty
to
tell
even
if
i
did
know
and
montague
stared
at
him
he
had
not
been
prepared
for
this
frankness
it
never
occurred
to
me
the
other
continued
that
that
was
a
matter
which
could
make
any
difference
to
you
why
began
montague
pray
understand
me
montague
said
the
judge
it
seemed
to
me
that
this
was
obviously
a
just
case
and
it
seemed
so
to
you
and
the
only
other
matter
that
i
thought
you
had
a
right
to
be
assured
of
was
that
it
was
seriously
meant
of
that
i
felt
assured
it
did
not
seem
to
me
of
any
importance
that
there
might
be
interested
individuals
behind
hasbrook
let
us
suppose
for
instance
that
there
were
some
parties
who
had
been
offended
by
the
administration
of
the
fidelity
and
were
anxious
to
punish
it
could
a
lawyer
be
justified
in
refusing
to
take
a
just
case
simply
because
he
knew
of
such
private
motives
or
let
us
assume
an
extreme
case
a
factional
fight
within
the
company
as
you
say
has
been
suggested
to
you
well
that
would
be
a
case
of
thieves
falling
out
and
is
there
any
reason
why
the
public
should
not
reap
the
advantage
of
such
a
situation
the
men
inside
the
company
are
the
ones
who
would
know
first
what
is
going
on
and
if
you
saw
a
chance
to
use
such
an
advantage
in
a
just
fight
would
you
not
do
it
so
the
judge
went
on
gracious
and
plausible
and
so
subtly
and
exquisitely
corrupting
underneath
his
smoothly
flowing
sentences
montague
could
feel
the
presence
of
one
fundamental
thought
it
was
unuttered
and
even
unhinted
but
it
pervaded
the
judge
discourse
as
a
mood
pervades
a
melody
the
young
lawyer
had
got
a
big
fee
and
he
had
a
nice
easy
case
and
as
a
man
of
the
world
he
could
not
really
wish
to
pry
into
it
too
closely
he
had
heard
gossip
and
felt
that
his
reputation
required
him
to
be
disturbed
but
he
had
come
simply
to
be
smoothed
down
the
back
and
made
at
ease
and
enabled
to
keep
his
fee
without
losing
his
good
opinion
of
himself
montague
quit
because
he
concluded
that
it
was
not
worth
while
to
try
to
make
himself
understood
after
all
he
was
in
the
case
now
and
there
was
nothing
to
be
gained
by
a
breach
two
things
he
felt
that
he
had
made
certain
by
the
interview
first
that
his
client
was
a
dummy
and
that
it
was
really
a
case
of
thieves
falling
out
and
second
that
he
had
no
guarantee
that
he
might
not
be
left
in
the
lurch
at
any
moment
except
the
touching
confidence
of
the
judge
in
some
parties
unknown
chapter
xix
montague
came
home
with
his
mind
made
up
that
there
was
nothing
he
could
do
except
to
be
more
careful
next
time
for
this
mistake
he
would
have
to
pay
the
price
he
had
still
to
learn
what
the
full
price
was
the
day
after
his
return
there
came
a
caller
john
burton
read
his
card
he
proved
to
be
a
canvassing
agent
for
the
company
which
published
the
of
society
they
were
preparing
a
de
luxe
account
of
the
prominent
families
of
new
york
a
very
sumptuous
affair
with
a
highly
exclusive
set
of
subscribers
at
the
rate
of
fifteen
hundred
dollars
per
set
would
montague
by
any
chance
care
to
have
his
family
included
and
montague
explained
politely
that
he
was
a
comparative
stranger
in
new
york
and
would
not
belong
properly
in
such
a
volume
but
the
agent
was
not
satisfied
with
this
there
might
be
reasons
for
his
subscribing
even
so
there
might
be
special
cases
montague
as
a
stranger
might
not
realize
the
important
nature
of
the
offer
after
he
had
consulted
his
friends
he
might
change
his
mind
and
so
on
as
montague
listened
to
this
series
of
broad
hints
and
took
in
the
meaning
of
them
the
colour
mounted
to
his
cheeks
until
at
last
he
rose
abruptly
and
bid
the
man
good
afternoon
but
then
as
he
sat
alone
his
anger
died
away
and
there
was
left
only
discomfort
and
uneasiness
and
three
or
four
days
later
he
bought
another
issue
of
the
paper
and
sure
enough
there
was
a
new
paragraph
he
stood
on
the
reading
it
the
social
war
was
raging
hotly
it
said
and
added
that
de
graffenried
was
threatening
to
take
up
the
cause
of
the
strangers
then
it
went
on
to
picture
a
certain
exquisite
young
man
of
fashion
who
was
rushing
about
among
his
friends
to
apologize
for
his
brother
indiscretions
also
it
said
there
was
a
brilliant
social
queen
wife
of
a
great
banker
who
had
taken
up
the
and
then
came
three
sentences
more
which
made
the
blood
leap
like
flame
into
montague
cheeks
there
have
not
been
lacking
comments
upon
her
suspicious
ardour
it
has
been
noticed
that
since
the
advent
of
the
southerner
this
restless
lady
interest
in
the
babists
and
the
trance
mediums
has
waned
and
now
society
is
watching
for
the
denouement
of
a
most
interesting
situation
to
montague
these
words
came
like
a
blow
in
the
face
he
went
on
down
the
street
half
dazed
it
seemed
to
him
the
blackest
shame
that
new
york
had
yet
shown
him
he
clenched
his
fists
as
he
walked
whispering
to
himself
the
scoundrels
he
realized
instantly
that
he
was
helpless
down
home
one
would
have
thrashed
the
editor
of
such
a
paper
but
here
he
was
in
the
wolves
own
country
and
he
could
do
nothing
he
went
back
to
his
office
and
sat
down
at
the
desk
my
dear
winnie
he
wrote
i
have
just
read
the
enclosed
paragraph
and
i
can
not
tell
you
how
profoundly
pained
i
am
that
your
kindness
to
us
should
have
made
you
the
victim
of
such
an
outrage
i
am
quite
helpless
in
the
matter
except
to
enable
you
to
avoid
any
further
annoyance
please
believe
me
when
i
say
that
we
shall
all
of
us
understand
perfectly
if
you
think
that
we
had
best
not
meet
again
at
present
and
that
this
will
make
no
difference
whatever
in
our
feelings
this
letter
montague
sent
by
a
messenger
and
then
he
went
home
perhaps
ten
minutes
after
he
arrived
the
telephone
bell
rang
and
there
was
winnie
your
note
has
come
she
said
have
you
an
engagement
this
evening
no
he
answered
well
she
said
will
you
come
to
dinner
winnie
he
protested
please
come
she
said
please
i
hate
to
have
you
he
began
i
wish
you
to
come
she
said
a
third
time
so
he
answered
very
well
he
went
and
when
he
entered
the
house
the
butler
led
him
to
the
elevator
saying
duval
says
will
you
please
come
upstairs
sir
and
there
winnie
met
him
with
flushed
cheeks
and
eager
countenance
she
was
even
lovelier
than
usual
in
a
soft
gown
and
a
crimson
rose
in
her
bosom
i
all
alone
she
said
so
we
dine
in
my
apartments
we
be
lost
in
that
big
room
downstairs
she
led
him
into
her
where
great
armfuls
of
new
roses
scattered
their
perfume
there
was
a
table
set
for
two
and
two
big
chairs
before
the
fire
which
blazed
in
the
hearth
montague
noticed
that
her
hand
trembled
a
little
as
she
motioned
him
to
one
of
them
he
could
read
her
excitement
in
her
whole
aspect
she
was
flinging
down
the
gauntlet
to
her
enemies
let
us
eat
first
and
talk
afterward
she
said
hurriedly
we
be
happy
for
a
while
anyway
and
she
went
on
to
be
happy
in
her
nervous
and
eager
way
she
talked
about
the
new
opera
which
was
to
be
given
and
about
de
graffenried
new
entertainment
and
about
ball
also
about
the
hospital
for
crippled
children
which
she
wanted
to
build
and
about
vivie
patton
rumoured
divorce
and
meantime
the
attendants
moved
here
and
there
and
the
dinner
came
and
went
they
took
their
coffee
in
the
big
chairs
by
the
fire
and
the
table
was
swept
clear
and
the
servants
vanished
closing
the
doors
behind
them
then
montague
set
his
cup
aside
and
sat
gazing
sombrely
into
the
fire
and
winnie
watched
him
there
was
a
long
silence
suddenly
he
heard
her
voice
do
you
find
it
so
easy
to
give
up
our
friendship
she
asked
i
did
think
about
it
being
easy
or
hard
he
answered
i
simply
thought
of
protecting
you
and
do
you
think
that
my
friends
are
nothing
to
me
she
demanded
have
i
so
very
many
as
that
and
she
clenched
her
hands
with
a
sudden
passionate
gesture
do
you
think
that
i
will
let
those
wretches
frighten
me
into
doing
what
they
want
i
not
give
in
to
them
not
for
anything
that
lelia
can
do
a
look
of
perplexity
crossed
montague
face
lelia
he
asked
robbie
walling
she
cried
do
you
suppose
that
she
is
responsible
for
that
paragraph
montague
started
that
the
way
they
fight
their
battles
cried
winnie
they
pay
money
to
those
scoundrels
to
be
protected
and
then
they
send
nasty
gossip
about
people
they
wish
to
injure
you
do
mean
that
exclaimed
the
man
of
course
i
do
cried
she
i
know
that
it
true
i
know
that
robbie
walling
paid
fifteen
thousand
dollars
for
some
trumpery
volumes
that
they
got
out
and
how
do
you
suppose
the
paper
gets
its
gossip
i
did
know
said
montague
but
i
never
dreamed
why
exclaimed
winnie
their
mail
is
full
of
blue
and
gold
monogram
stationery
i
known
guests
to
sit
down
and
write
gossip
about
their
hostesses
in
their
own
homes
oh
you
no
idea
of
people
vileness
i
had
some
idea
said
montague
after
a
that
was
why
i
wished
to
protect
you
i
do
wish
to
be
protected
she
cried
vehemently
i
not
give
them
the
satisfaction
they
wish
to
make
me
give
you
up
and
i
not
do
it
for
anything
they
can
say
montague
sat
with
knitted
brows
gazing
into
the
fire
when
i
read
that
paragraph
he
said
slowly
i
could
not
bear
to
think
of
the
unhappiness
it
might
cause
you
i
thought
of
how
much
it
might
disturb
your
husband
my
husband
echoed
winnie
there
was
a
hard
tone
in
her
voice
as
she
went
on
he
will
fix
it
up
with
them
she
said
that
his
way
there
will
be
nothing
more
published
you
can
feel
sure
of
that
montague
sat
in
silence
that
was
not
the
reply
he
had
expected
and
it
rather
disconcerted
him
if
that
were
all
he
said
with
hesitation
but
i
could
not
know
i
thought
that
the
paragraph
might
disturb
him
for
another
reason
that
it
might
be
a
cause
of
unhappiness
between
you
and
him
there
was
a
pause
you
do
understand
said
winnie
at
last
without
turning
his
head
he
could
see
her
hands
as
they
lay
upon
her
knees
she
was
moving
them
nervously
you
do
understand
she
repeated
when
she
began
to
speak
again
it
was
in
a
low
trembling
voice
i
must
tell
you
she
said
i
have
felt
sure
that
you
did
not
know
there
was
another
pause
she
hesitated
and
her
hands
trembled
then
suddenly
she
hurried
i
wanted
you
to
know
i
do
not
love
my
husband
i
am
not
bound
to
him
he
has
nothing
to
say
in
my
affairs
montague
sat
rigid
turned
to
stone
he
was
half
dazed
by
the
words
he
could
feel
winnie
gaze
fixed
upon
him
and
he
could
feel
the
hot
flush
that
spread
over
her
throat
and
cheeks
it
it
was
not
fair
for
you
not
to
know
she
whispered
and
her
voice
died
away
and
there
was
again
a
silence
montague
was
dumb
why
do
you
say
something
she
panted
at
last
and
he
caught
the
note
of
anguish
in
her
voice
then
he
turned
and
stared
at
her
and
saw
her
tightly
clenched
hands
and
the
quivering
of
her
lips
he
was
shocked
quite
beyond
speech
and
he
saw
her
bosom
heaving
quickly
and
saw
the
tears
start
into
her
eyes
suddenly
she
sank
down
and
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
broke
into
frantic
sobbing
mrs
winnie
he
cried
and
started
to
his
feet
her
outburst
continued
he
saw
that
she
was
shuddering
violently
then
you
do
love
me
she
wailed
he
stood
trembling
and
utterly
bewildered
i
so
sorry
he
whispered
oh
winnie
i
had
no
idea
i
know
it
i
know
it
she
cried
it
my
fault
i
was
a
fool
i
knew
it
all
the
time
but
i
hoped
i
thought
you
might
if
you
knew
and
then
again
her
tears
choked
her
she
was
convulsed
with
pain
and
grief
montague
stood
watching
her
helpless
with
distress
she
caught
hold
of
the
arm
of
the
chair
convulsively
and
he
put
his
hand
upon
hers
winnie
he
began
but
she
jerked
her
hand
away
and
hid
it
no
no
she
cried
in
terror
do
touch
me
and
suddenly
she
looked
up
at
him
stretching
out
her
arms
do
you
understand
that
i
love
you
she
exclaimed
you
despise
me
for
it
i
know
but
i
ca
help
it
i
will
tell
you
even
so
it
the
only
satisfaction
i
can
have
i
have
always
loved
you
and
i
thought
i
thought
it
was
only
that
you
did
understand
i
was
ready
to
brave
all
the
world
i
did
care
who
knew
it
or
what
anybody
said
i
thought
we
could
be
happy
i
thought
i
could
be
free
at
last
oh
you
no
idea
how
unhappy
i
am
and
how
lonely
and
how
i
longed
to
escape
and
i
believed
that
you
that
you
might
and
then
the
tears
gushed
into
winnie
eyes
again
and
her
voice
became
the
voice
of
a
little
child
do
you
think
that
you
might
come
to
love
me
she
wailed
her
voice
shook
montague
so
that
he
trembled
to
the
depths
of
him
but
his
face
only
became
the
more
grave
you
despise
me
because
i
told
you
she
exclaimed
no
no
winnie
he
said
i
could
not
possibly
do
that
then
then
why
she
would
it
be
so
hard
to
love
me
it
would
be
very
easy
he
said
but
i
dare
not
let
myself
she
looked
at
him
piteously
you
are
so
cold
so
merciless
she
cried
he
answered
nothing
and
she
sat
trembling
have
you
ever
loved
a
woman
she
asked
there
was
a
long
pause
he
sat
in
the
chair
again
listen
winnie
he
began
at
last
do
call
me
that
she
exclaimed
call
me
evelyn
please
very
well
he
said
evelyn
i
did
not
intend
to
make
you
unhappy
if
i
had
had
any
idea
i
should
never
have
seen
you
again
i
will
tell
you
what
i
have
never
told
anybody
before
then
you
will
understand
he
sat
for
a
few
moments
in
a
sombre
reverie
once
he
said
when
i
was
young
i
loved
a
woman
a
quadroon
girl
that
was
in
new
orleans
it
is
a
custom
we
have
there
they
have
a
world
of
their
own
and
we
take
care
of
them
and
of
the
children
and
every
one
knows
about
it
i
was
very
young
only
about
eighteen
and
she
was
even
younger
but
i
found
out
then
what
women
are
and
what
love
means
to
them
i
saw
how
they
could
suffer
and
then
she
died
in
childbirth
the
child
died
too
montague
voice
was
very
low
and
winnie
sat
with
her
hands
clasped
and
her
eyes
riveted
upon
his
face
i
saw
her
die
he
said
and
that
was
all
i
have
never
forgotten
it
i
made
up
my
mind
then
that
i
had
done
wrong
and
that
never
again
while
i
lived
would
i
offer
my
love
to
a
woman
unless
i
could
devote
all
my
life
to
her
so
you
see
i
am
afraid
of
love
i
do
not
wish
to
suffer
so
much
or
to
make
others
suffer
and
when
anyone
speaks
to
me
as
you
did
it
brings
it
all
back
to
me
it
makes
me
shrink
up
and
wither
he
paused
and
the
other
caught
her
breath
understand
me
she
said
her
voice
trembling
i
would
not
ask
any
pledges
of
you
i
would
pay
whatever
price
there
was
to
pay
i
am
not
afraid
to
suffer
i
do
not
wish
you
to
suffer
he
said
i
do
not
wish
to
take
advantage
of
any
woman
but
i
have
nothing
in
the
world
that
i
value
she
cried
i
would
go
away
i
would
give
up
everything
to
be
with
a
man
like
you
i
have
no
ties
no
duties
he
interrupted
her
you
have
your
husband
he
said
and
she
cried
out
in
sudden
fury
my
husband
has
no
one
ever
told
you
about
my
husband
she
asked
after
a
pause
no
one
he
said
well
ask
them
she
exclaimed
meantime
take
my
word
for
it
i
owe
nothing
to
my
husband
montague
sat
staring
into
the
fire
but
consider
my
own
case
he
said
have
duties
my
mother
and
my
cousin
oh
do
say
any
more
cried
the
woman
with
a
break
in
her
voice
say
that
you
do
love
me
that
is
all
there
is
to
say
and
you
will
never
respect
me
again
i
have
been
a
fool
i
have
ruined
everything
i
have
flung
away
your
friendship
that
i
might
have
kept
no
he
said
but
she
rushed
on
vehemently
at
least
i
have
been
honest
give
me
credit
for
that
that
is
how
all
my
troubles
come
i
say
what
is
in
my
mind
and
i
pay
the
price
for
my
blunders
it
is
not
as
if
i
were
cold
and
calculating
so
do
despise
me
altogether
i
could
despise
you
said
montague
i
am
simply
pained
because
i
have
made
you
unhappy
and
i
did
not
mean
to
winnie
sat
staring
ahead
of
her
in
a
sombre
reverie
do
think
any
more
about
it
she
said
bitterly
i
will
get
over
it
i
am
not
worth
troubling
about
do
you
suppose
i
know
how
you
feel
about
this
world
that
i
live
in
and
i
part
of
it
i
beat
my
wings
and
try
to
get
out
but
i
ca
i
in
it
and
i
stay
in
till
i
die
i
might
as
well
give
up
i
thought
that
i
could
steal
a
little
joy
you
have
no
idea
how
hungry
i
am
for
a
little
joy
you
have
no
idea
how
lonely
i
am
and
how
empty
my
life
is
you
talk
about
your
fear
of
making
me
unhappy
it
a
grim
jest
but
i
give
you
permission
if
you
can
i
ask
nothing
no
promises
no
sacrifices
i
take
all
the
risks
and
pay
all
the
penalties
she
smiled
through
her
tears
a
sardonic
smile
he
was
watching
her
and
she
turned
again
and
their
eyes
met
again
he
saw
the
blood
mount
from
her
throat
to
her
cheeks
at
the
same
time
came
the
old
stirring
of
the
wild
beasts
within
him
he
knew
that
the
less
time
he
spent
in
sympathizing
with
winnie
the
better
for
both
of
them
he
had
started
to
rise
and
words
of
farewell
were
on
his
lips
when
suddenly
there
came
a
knock
upon
the
door
winnie
sprang
to
her
feet
who
is
that
she
cried
and
the
door
opened
and
duval
entered
good
evening
he
said
pleasantly
and
came
toward
her
winnie
flushed
angrily
and
stared
at
him
why
do
you
come
here
unannounced
she
cried
i
apologize
he
said
but
i
found
this
in
my
mail
and
montague
in
the
act
of
rising
to
greet
him
saw
that
he
had
the
offensive
clipping
in
his
hand
then
he
saw
duval
give
a
start
and
realized
that
the
man
had
not
been
aware
of
his
presence
in
the
room
duval
gazed
from
montague
to
his
wife
and
noticed
for
the
first
time
her
tears
and
her
agitation
i
beg
pardon
he
said
i
am
evidently
trespassing
you
most
certainly
are
responded
winnie
he
made
a
move
to
withdraw
but
before
he
could
take
a
step
she
had
brushed
past
him
and
left
the
room
slamming
the
door
behind
her
and
duval
stared
after
her
and
then
he
stared
at
montague
and
laughed
well
well
well
he
said
then
checking
his
amusement
he
added
good
evening
sir
good
evening
said
montague
he
was
trembling
slightly
and
duval
noticed
it
he
smiled
genially
this
is
the
sort
of
material
out
of
which
scenes
are
made
said
he
but
i
beg
you
not
to
be
embarrassed
we
wo
have
any
scenes
montague
could
think
of
nothing
to
say
to
that
i
owe
evelyn
an
apology
the
other
continued
it
was
entirely
an
accident
this
clipping
you
see
i
do
not
intrude
as
a
rule
you
may
make
yourself
at
home
in
future
montague
flushed
scarlet
at
the
words
duval
he
said
i
have
to
assure
you
that
you
are
mistaken
the
other
stared
at
him
oh
come
come
he
said
laughing
let
us
talk
as
men
of
the
world
i
say
that
you
are
mistaken
said
montague
again
the
other
shrugged
his
shoulders
very
well
he
said
genially
as
you
please
i
simply
wish
to
make
matters
clear
to
you
that
all
i
wish
you
joy
with
evelyn
i
say
nothing
about
her
you
love
her
suffice
it
that
i
had
her
and
i
tired
of
her
the
field
is
yours
but
keep
her
out
of
mischief
and
do
let
her
make
a
fool
of
herself
in
public
if
you
can
help
it
and
do
let
her
spend
too
much
money
she
costs
me
a
million
a
year
good
evening
mr
montague
and
he
went
out
montague
who
stood
like
a
statue
could
hear
him
chuckling
all
the
way
down
the
hall
at
last
montague
himself
started
to
leave
but
he
heard
winnie
coming
back
and
he
waited
for
her
she
came
in
and
shut
the
door
and
turned
toward
him
what
did
he
say
she
asked
he
was
very
pleasant
said
montague
and
she
smiled
grimly
i
went
out
on
purpose
she
said
i
wanted
you
to
see
him
to
see
what
sort
of
a
man
he
is
and
how
much
i
owe
him
you
saw
i
guess
yes
i
saw
said
he
then
again
he
started
to
go
but
she
took
him
by
the
arm
come
and
talk
to
me
she
said
please
and
she
led
him
back
to
the
fire
listen
she
said
he
will
not
come
here
again
he
is
going
away
i
thought
he
had
gone
already
and
he
does
not
return
for
a
month
or
two
there
will
be
no
one
to
disturb
us
again
she
came
close
to
him
and
gazed
up
into
his
face
she
had
wiped
her
tears
away
and
her
happy
look
had
come
back
to
her
she
was
lovelier
than
ever
i
took
you
by
surprise
she
said
smiling
you
did
know
what
to
make
of
it
and
i
was
ashamed
i
thought
you
would
hate
me
but
i
not
going
to
be
unhappy
any
more
i
do
care
at
all
i
glad
that
i
spoke
and
winnie
put
up
her
hands
and
took
him
by
the
lapels
of
his
coat
i
know
that
you
love
me
she
said
i
saw
it
in
your
eyes
just
now
before
he
came
in
it
is
simply
that
you
wo
let
yourself
go
you
have
so
many
doubts
and
so
many
fears
but
you
will
see
that
i
am
right
you
will
learn
to
love
me
you
wo
be
able
to
help
it
i
shall
be
so
kind
and
good
only
do
go
away
winnie
was
so
close
to
him
that
her
breath
touched
his
cheek
promise
me
dear
she
whispered
promise
me
that
you
wo
stop
seeing
me
that
you
will
learn
to
love
me
i
ca
do
without
you
montague
was
trembling
in
every
nerve
he
felt
like
a
man
caught
in
a
net
winnie
had
had
everything
she
ever
wanted
in
her
life
and
now
she
wanted
him
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
face
any
other
thought
listen
he
began
gently
but
she
saw
the
look
of
resistance
in
his
eyes
and
she
cried
no
no
do
i
can
not
do
without
you
think
i
love
you
what
more
can
i
say
to
you
i
can
not
believe
that
you
do
care
for
me
you
have
been
fond
of
me
i
have
seen
it
in
your
face
yet
you
afraid
of
me
why

at
me

i
not
beautiful
to
look
at
and
is
a
woman

such
a
little
thing
can
you
fling
it
away
and
trample
upon
it
so
easily
why
do
you
wish
to
go
do
you
understand
no
one
knows
we
are
here
no
one
cares
you
can
come
here
whenever
you
wish
this
is
my
place

and
no
one
will
think
anything
about
it
they
all
do
it
there
is
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
she
put
her
arms
about
him
and
clung
to
him
so
that
he
could
feel
the
beating
of
her
heart
upon
his
bosom
oh
do
leave
me
here
alone
she
cried
to
montague
it
was
like
the
ringing
of
an
deep
within
his
soul
i
must
go
he
said
she
flung
back
her
head
and
stared
at
him
and
he
saw
the
terror
and
anguish
in
her
eyes
no
no
she
cried
do
say
that
to
me
i
ca
bear
it
oh
see
what
i
have
done
look
at
me
have
mercy
on
me
winnie
he
said
you
must
have
mercy
on
me
but
he
only
felt
her
clasp
him
more
tightly
he
took
her
by
the
wrists
and
with
quiet
force
he
broke
her
hold
upon
him
her
hands
fell
to
her
sides
and
she
stared
at
him
aghast
i
must
go
he
said
again
and
he
started
toward
the
door
she
followed
him
dumbly
with
her
eyes
he
said
he
knew
that
there
was
no
use
of
any
more
words
his
sympathy
had
been
like
oil
upon
flames
he
saw
her
move
and
as
he
opened
the
door
she
flung
herself
down
in
a
chair
and
burst
into
frantic
weeping
he
shut
the
door
softly
and
went
away
he
found
his
way
down
the
stairs
and
got
his
hat
and
coat
and
went
out
unseen
by
anyone
he
walked
down
the
there
suddenly
was
the
giant
bulk
of
cecilia
lifting
itself
into
the
sky
he
stopped
and
looked
at
it
it
seemed
a
great
tumultuous
surge
of
emotion
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
understood
why
men
had
put
together
that
towering
heap
of
stone
then
he
went
on
home
he
found
alice
dressing
for
a
ball
and
oliver
waiting
for
her
he
went
to
his
room
and
took
off
his
coat
and
oliver
came
up
to
him
and
with
a
sudden
gesture
reached
over
to
his
shoulder
and
held
up
a
trophy
he
drew
it
out
carefully
and
measured
the
length
of
it
smiling
mischievously
in
the
meanwhile
then
he
held
it
up
to
the
light
to
see
the
colour
of
it
a
black
one
he
cried
coal
black
and
he
looked
at
his
brother
with
a
merry
twinkle
in
his
eyes
oh
allan
he
chuckled
montague
said
nothing
chapter
xx
it
was
about
a
week
from
the
beginning
of
lent
when
there
would
be
a
lull
in
the
city
gaieties
and
society
would
shift
the
scene
of
its
activities
to
the
country
clubs
and
to
california
and
hot
springs
and
palm
beach
caroline
smythe
invited
alice
to
join
her
in
an
expedition
to
the
place
but
montague
interposed
because
he
saw
that
alice
had
been
made
pale
and
nervous
by
three
months
of
festivities
also
a
trip
to
florida
would
necessitate
ten
or
fifteen
thousand
dollars
worth
of
new
clothes
and
these
would
not
do
for
the
summer
it
appeared
they
would
be
faded
and
passe
by
that
time
so
alice
settled
back
to
rest
but
she
was
too
popular
to
be
let
alone
a
few
days
later
came
another
invitation
this
time
from
general
prentice
and
his
family
they
were
planning
a
railroad
trip
to
be
gone
for
a
month
they
would
have
a
private
train
and
twenty
five
people
in
the
party
and
would
take
in
california
and
mexico
swinging
round
the
circle
as
it
was
called
alice
was
wild
to
go
and
montague
gave
his
consent
afterward
he
learned
to
his
dismay
that
charlie
carter
was
one
of
those
invited
and
he
would
have
liked
to
have
alice
withdraw
but
she
did
not
wish
to
and
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
insist
these
train
trips
were
the
very
latest
diversion
of
the
a
year
ago
no
one
had
heard
of
them
and
now
fifty
parties
were
leaving
new
york
every
month
you
might
see
a
dozen
of
such
at
once
at
palm
beach
there
were
some
people
who
lived
on
board
all
the
time
having
special
tracks
built
for
them
in
pleasant
locations
wherever
they
stopped
one
man
had
built
a
huge
automobile
railroad
car
shaped
like
a
ram
and
having
accommodation
for
sixty
people
the
prentice
train
had
four
cars
one
of
them
a
library
car
finished
in
iago
mahogany
and
provided
with
a
also
there
were
and
a
and
a
baggage
car
with
two
autos
on
board
for
exploring
purposes
since
the
episode
of
winnie
oliver
had
apparently
concluded
that
his
brother
was
one
of
the
initiated
not
long
afterward
he
permitted
him
to
a
glimpse
into
that
side
of
his
life
which
had
been
hinted
at
in
the
songs
at
the
bachelors
dinner
oliver
had
planned
to
take
betty
wyman
to
the
theatre
but
grandfather
had
come
home
from
the
west
unexpectedly
and
so
oliver
came
round
and
took
his
brother
instead
i
was
going
to
play
a
joke
on
her
he
said
we
go
to
see
one
of
my
old
flames
it
was
a
translation
of
a
french
farce
in
which
the
marital
infidelities
of
two
young
couples
were
the
occasion
of
many
mishaps
one
of
the
characters
was
a
who
was
in
love
with
a
handsome
young
soldier
and
was
pursued
by
the
husband
of
one
of
the
couples
it
was
a
minor
part
but
the
young
jewish
girl
who
played
it
had
so
many
pretty
graces
and
such
a
merry
laugh
that
she
made
it
quite
conspicuous
when
the
act
was
over
oliver
asked
him
whose
acting
he
liked
best
and
he
named
her
come
and
be
introduced
to
her
oliver
said
he
opened
a
door
near
their
box
how
do
you
do
wilson
he
said
nodding
to
a
man
in
evening
dress
who
stood
near
by
then
he
turned
toward
the
and
went
down
a
corridor
and
knocked
upon
one
of
the
doors
a
voice
called
come
in
and
he
opened
the
door
and
there
was
a
tiny
room
with
odds
and
ends
of
clothing
scattered
about
and
the
girl
clad
in
corsets
and
underskirt
sitting
before
a
mirror
hello
rosalie
said
he
and
she
dropped
her
and
sprang
up
with
a
cry
ollie
a
moment
more
she
had
her
arms
about
his
neck
oh
you
wretched
man
she
cried
why
do
you
come
to
see
me

more

get
my
letters

he
but
i

allan
montague
the
other
nodded
to
montague
and
said
how
do
you
do
but
without
letting
go
of
oliver
why
do
you
come
to
see
me
she
exclaimed
there
there
now
said
oliver
laughing
i
brought
my
brother
along
so
that
you
have
to
behave
yourself
i
do
care
about
your
brother
exclaimed
the
girl
without
even
giving
him
another
glance
then
she
held
oliver
at
arm
length
and
gazed
into
his
face
how
can
you
be
so
cruel
to
me
she
asked
i
told
you

was
busy
said
he
cheerfully
and
i
gave
you
fair
warning
did
i
how
toodles
oh

in
raptures
said
rosalie
she
got
a
new
fellow
and
then
her
manner
changing
to
one
of
merriment
she
added
oh
ollie
he
gave
her
a
diamond
brooch
and
she
looks
like
a
countess
she
hoping
for
a
chance
to
wear
it
in
a
part

toodles
said
oliver
to
his
brother
she
in
kaliph
of
they
going
on
the
road
next

said
rosalie
and
then
i
be
all
alone
she
added
in
a
pleading
voice

boy
and

she
cried
i
come
right
over
the
footlights
after
you
you
better
get
dressed
said
oliver
you
be
late
he
pushed
aside
a
tray
with
some
glasses
on
it
and
seated
himself
upon
a
trunk
and
montague
stood
in
a
corner
and
watched
rosalie
while
she
powdered
and
painted
herself
and
put
on
an
airy
summer
dress
and
poured
out
a
flood
of
gossip
about
toodles
and
flossie
and
grace
and
some
others
a
few
minutes
later
came
a
stentorian
voice
in
the
hallway
second
act
there
were
more
embraces
and
then
ollie
brushed
the
powder
from
his
coat
and
went
away
laughing
montague
stood
for
a
few
moments
in
the
wings
watching
the
putting
the
final
touches
to
the
new
set
and
the
various
characters
taking
their
positions
then
they
went
out
to
their
seats
is
she
a
jewel
asked
oliver
she
very
pretty
the
other
admitted
she
came
right
out
of
the
slums
said
oliver
over
on
rivington
street
that
do
happen
very
often
how
did
you
come
to
know
her
asked
his
brother
oh
i
picked
her
out
she
was
in
a
chorus
then
i
got
her
first
speaking
part
did
you
said
the
other
in
surprise
how
did
you
do
that
oh
a
little
money
was
the
reply
money
will
do
most
anything
and
i
was
in
love
with
her
that
how
i
got
her
montague
said
nothing
but
sat
in
thought
we
take
her
out
to
supper
and
make
her
happy
added
oliver
as
the
curtain
started
up
she
lonesome
i
guess
you
see
i
promised
betty
i
reform
all
through
that
scene
and
the
next
one
rosalie
acted
for
them
she
was
so
full
of
verve
and
merriment
that
there
was
quite
a
stir
in
the
audience
and
she
got
several
rounds
of
applause
then
when
the
play
was
over
she
extricated
herself
from
the
arms
of
the
handsome
young
soldier
and
fled
to
her
and
when
oliver
and
montague
arrived
she
was
half
ready
for
the
street
they
went
up
broadway
and
from
a
group
of
people
coming
out
of
another
a
young
girl
came
to
join
them
an
airy
little
creature
with
the
face
of
a
and
a
big
hat
with
a
purple
feather
on
top
this
was
toodles
otherwise
known
as
helen
gwynne
and
she
took
montague
arm
and
they
fell
in
behind
oliver
and
his
companion
montague
wondered
what
one
said
to
a
on
the
way
to
supper
afterward
his
brother
told
him
that
toodles
had
been
the
wife
of
a
agent
in
a
little
town
in
oklahoma
and
had
run
away
from
respectability
and
boredom
with
a
travelling
theatrical
company
now
she
was
tripping
her
part
in
the
musical
comedy
which
montague
had
seen
at
lane
and
incidentally
swearing
devotion
to
a
handsome
young
she
confided
to
montague
that
she
hoped
the
latter
might
see
her
that
evening
he
needed
to
be
made
jealous
the
great
white
way
was
the
name
which
people
had
given
to
this
part
of
broadway
and
at
the
head
of
it
stood
a
huge
hotel
with
flaming
lights
and
gorgeous
marble
and
bronze
and
famous
paintings
upon
the
walls
and
ceilings
inside
at
this
hour
every
one
of
its
many
was
thronged
with
and
the
place
rang
with
laughter
and
the
rattle
of
dishes
and
the
strains
of
several
orchestras
which
toiled
heroically
in
the
midst
of
the
uproar
here
they
found
a
table
and
while
oliver
was
ordering
frozen
poached
eggs
and
quails
in
aspic
montague
sat
and
gazed
about
him
at
the
revelry
and
listened
to
the
prattle
of
the
little
from
rivington
street
his
brother
had
got
her
he
said
by
buying
a
speaking
part
in
a
play
for
her
and
montague
recalled
the
orgies
of
which
he
had
heard
at
the
bachelors
dinner
and
divined
that
here
he
was
at
the
source
of
the
stream
from
which
they
were
fed
at
the
table
next
to
them
was
a
young
hebrew
whom
toodles
pointed
out
as
the
son
and
heir
of
a
great
clothing
manufacturer
he
was
keeping
several
girls
said
she
and
the
queenly
creature
who
was
his
was
one
of
the
chorus
in
the
maids
of
mandalay
and
a
little
way
farther
down
the
room
was
a
boy
with
the
face
of
an
angel
and
the
air
of
a
prince
of
the
blood
he
had
inherited
a
million
and
run
away
from
school
and
was
making
a
name
for
himself
in
the
tenderloin
the
pretty
little
girl
all
in
green
who
was
with
him
was
violet
pane
who
was
the
artist
model
in
a
new
play
that
had
made
a
hit
she
had
had
a
picture
of
herself
in
the
sunday
supplement
of
the
sporting
paper
which
was
read
here
so
rosalie
remarked
why
do
you
ever
do
that
for
me
she
added
to
oliver
perhaps
i
will
said
he
with
a
laugh
what
does
it
cost
and
when
he
learned
that
the
honour
could
be
purchased
for
only
fifteen
hundred
dollars
he
said
i
do
it
if
you
be
good
and
from
that
time
on
the
last
trace
of
worriment
vanished
from
the
face
and
the
conversation
of
rosalie
as
the
champagne
cocktails
disappeared
she
and
oliver
became
confidential
then
montague
turned
to
toodles
to
learn
more
about
how
the
second
generation
was
preying
upon
the
women
of
the
stage
a
got
from
ten
to
twenty
dollars
a
week
said
toodles
and
that
was
hardly
enough
to
pay
for
her
clothes
her
work
was
very
uncertain
she
would
spend
weeks
at
rehearsal
and
then
if
the
play
failed
she
would
get
nothing
it
was
a
dog
life
and
the
keys
of
freedom
and
opportunity
were
in
the
keeping
of
rich
men
who
haunted
the
theatres
and
laid
siege
to
the
girls
they
would
send
in
notes
to
them
or
fling
bouquets
to
them
with
cards
or
perhaps
money
hidden
in
them
there
were
millionaire
artists
and
bohemians
who
kept
a
standing
order
for
seats
in
the
front
rows
at
opening
performances
they
had
accounts
with
florists
and
liverymen
and
confectioners
and
gave
carte
blanche
to
scores
of
girls
who
lent
themselves
to
their
purposes
sometimes
they
were
in
league
with
the
managers
and
a
girl
who
held
back
would
find
her
chances
imperilled
sometimes
these
men
would
even
finance
shows
to
give
a
chance
to
some
favourite
afterward
toodles
turned
to
listen
to
oliver
and
his
companion
and
montague
sat
back
and
gazed
about
the
room
next
to
him
was
a
long
table
with
a
dozen
people
at
it
and
he
watched
the
buckets
of
champagne
and
the
endless
succession
of
dishes
of
food
and
the
revellers
with
their
flushed
faces
and
feverish
eyes
and
loud
laughter
above
all
the
tumult
was
the
voice
of
the
orchestra
calling
calling
like
the
storm
wind
upon
the
mountains
the
music
was
wild
and
chaotic
and
produced
an
indescribable
sense
of
pain
and
confusion
when
one
realized
that
this
same
thing
was
going
on
in
thousands
of
places
in
this
district
it
seemed
that
here
was
a
flood
of
dissipation
that
even
that
of
society
it
was
said
that
the
hotels
of
new
york
placed
end
to
end
would
reach
all
the
way
to
london
and
they
took
care
of
a
couple
of
hundred
thousand
people
a
day
a
horde
which
had
come
from
all
over
the
world
in
search
of
pleasure
and
excitement
there
were
and
country
customers

from
texas
and
lumber
kings
from
maine
and
mining
men
from
nevada
at
home
they
had
reputations
and
perhaps
families
to
consider
but
once
plunged
into
the
whirlpool
of
the
tenderloin
they
were
hidden
from
all
the
world
they
came
with
their
pockets
full
of
money
and
hotels
and
restaurants
and
and
brothels
all
were
lying
in
wait
for
them
so
eager
had
the
competition
become
that
there
was
a
tailoring
establishment
and
a
bank
that
were
never
closed
the
year
round
except
on
sunday
everywhere
about
one
feet
the
nets
of
vice
were
spread
the
head
waiter
in
one
hotel
was
a
steerer
for
a
dive
and
the
house
detective
was
touting
for
a
the
handsome
woman
who
smiled
at
one
in
peacock
alley
was
a
madame
the
young
man
who
spoke
to
one
at
the
bar
was
on
the
for
customers
for
a
next
door
three
times
in
a
single
day
in
another
of
these
great
caravanserais
montague
was
offered
short
change
and
so
his
eyes
were
opened
to
a
new
kind
of
plundering
he
was
struck
by
the
number
of
attendants
in
livery
who
swarmed
about
him
and
to
whom
he
gave
tips
for
their
services
he
did
not
notice
that
the
boys
in
the
and
could
not
speak
a
word
of
english
he
could
not
know
that
they
were
searched
every
night
and
had
everything
taken
from
them
and
that
the
greek
who
hired
them
had
paid
fifteen
thousand
dollars
a
year
to
the
hotel
for
the
privilege
so
far
had
the
specialization
in
evil
proceeded
that
there
were
places
of
prostitution
which
did
a
exclusively
and
would
send
a
woman
in
a
cab
to
any
address
and
there
were
which
furnished
exquisite
apartments
and
the
services
of
maids
and
valets
and
in
this
world
of
vice
the
modern
doctrine
of
the
equality
of
the
sexes
was
fully
recognized
there
were
and
and
for
women
and
which
catered
especially
for
them
in
the
orange
room
of
one
of
the
big
hotels
you
might
see
rich
women
of
every
rank
and
type
fingering
the
dainty
and
wine
cards
in
this
room
alone
were
sold
over
ten
thousand
drinks
every
day
and
the
hotel
paid
a
rental
of
a
million
a
year
to
the
devon
estate
not
far
away
the
devons
also
owned
where
in
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
you
might
see
white
women
drinking
in
this
seething
caldron
of
graft
there
were
many
strange
ways
of
making
money
and
many
strange
and
incredible
types
of
human
beings
to
be
met
once
in
society
montague
had
pointed
out
to
him
a
woman
who
had
been
a
tattooed
lady
in
a
circus
there
was
another
who
had
been
a
confederate
of
gamblers
upon
the
ocean
steamships
and
another
who
had
washed
dishes
in
a
there
was
one
of
these
great
hotels
whose
proprietor
had
been
a
successful
burglar
and
a
whose
owner
had
begun
life
as
a
fence
in
any
crowd
of
these
revellers
you
might
have
such
strange
creatures
pointed
out
to
you
a
multimillionaire
who
sold
rotten
jam
to
the
people
another
who
had
invented
opium
for
babies
a
convivial
old
gentleman
who
disbursed
the
yellow
dog
fund
of
several
railroads
a
handsome
chauffeur
who
had
run
away
with
an
heiress
a
great
scientist
had
invented
a
new
kind
of
underwear
and
had
endeavoured
to
make
it
a
gift
to
humanity
and
here
was
a
man
who
had
seized
upon
it
and
made
millions
out
of
it
here
was
a
trance
medium
who
had
got
a
fortune
out
of
an
imbecile
old
manufacturer
here
was
a
great
newspaper
proprietor
who
published
advertisements
of
assignations
at
a
dollar
a
line
here
was
a
cigar
manufacturer
whose
smug
face
was
upon
every
billboard
he
had
begun
as
a
tin
manufacturer
and
to
avoid
the
duty
he
had
had
his
raw
material
cast
in
the
form
of
statues
and
brought
them
in
as
works
of
art
and
terrible
and
vile
as
were
the
sources
from
which
the
fortunes
had
been
derived
they
were
no
viler
nor
more
terrible
than
the
purposes
for
which
they
had
been
spent
vivie
patton
had
hinted
to
montague
of
a
decameron
club
whose
members
gathered
in
each
others
homes
and
vied
in
the
telling
of
obscene
stories
strathcona
had
told
him
about
another
set
of
exquisite
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
gave
elaborate
entertainments
in
which
they
dressed
in
the
costumes
of
bygone
periods
and
imitated
famous
characters
in
history
and
the
vices
and
orgies
of
courts
and
camps
one
heard
of
cleopatra
nights
on
board
of
yachts
at
newport
there
was
a
certain
wall
street
plunger
who
had
begun
life
as
a
mining
man
in
the
west
and
when
his
customers
came
in
town
he
would
hire
a
and
take
a
load
of
champagne
and
half
a
dozen
prostitutes
and
spend
the
night
careering
about
the
country
this
man
was
now
quartered
in
one
of
the
great
hotels
in
new
york
and
in
his
apartments
he
would
have
prize
fights
and
chicken
fights
and
bloodthirsty
exhibitions
called
purring
matches
in
which
men
tried
to
bark
each
other
shins
or
perhaps
a
battle
royal
with
a
diamond
dangling
from
the
ceiling
and
half
a
dozen
negroes
in
a
fight
for
the
prize
no
picture
of
the
ways
of
the
metropolis
would
be
complete
which
did
not
force
upon
the
reluctant
reader
some
realization
of
the
extent
to
which
new
and
hideous
incitements
to
vice
were
spreading
to
say
that
among
the
leisured
classes
such
practices
were
raging
like
a
pestilence
would
be
no
exaggeration
ten
years
ago
they
were
regarded
with
aversion
by
even
the
professionally
vicious
but
now
the
commonest
prostitute
accepted
them
as
part
of
her
fate
and
there
was
no
height
to
which
they
had
not
reached
ministers
of
state
were
enslaved
by
them
great
fortunes
and
public
events
were
controlled
by
them
in
washington
there
had
been
an
ambassador
whose
natural
daughter
taught
them
in
the
houses
of
the
great
until
the
scandal
forced
the
minister
recall
some
of
these
practices
were
terrible
in
their
effects
completely
wrecking
the
victim
in
a
short
time
and
physicians
who
studied
their
symptoms
would
be
horrified
to
see
them
appearing
in
the
homes
of
their
friends
and
from
new
york
the
centre
of
the
wealth
and
culture
of
the
country
these
vices
spread
to
every
corner
of
it
theatrical
companies
and
travelling
salesmen
carried
them
visiting
merchants
and
sightseers
acquired
them
sold
vile
pictures
and
books
the
manufacturing
or
importing
of
which
was
now
quite
an
industry
one
might
read
catalogues
printed
abroad
in
english
the
contents
of
which
would
make
one
flesh
creep
there
were
cheap
weeklies
costing
ten
cents
a
year
which
were
thrust
into
for
there
were
french
novels
of
unbelievable
depravity
for
the
mistress
of
the
house
it
was
a
curious
commentary
upon
the
morals
of
society
that
upon
the
trains
running
to
a
certain
suburban
community
frequented
by
the
the
newsboys
did
a
thriving
business
in
such
literature
and
when
the
pastor
of
the
fashionable
church
eloped
with
a
society
girl
the
bishop
publicly
laid
the
blame
to
the
morals
of
his
parishioners
the
theory
was
that
there
were
two
worlds
and
that
they
were
kept
rigidly
separate
there
were
two
sets
of
women
one
to
be
toyed
with
and
flung
aside
and
the
other
to
be
protected
and
esteemed
such
things
as
prostitutes
and
kept
women
might
exist
but
people
of
refinement
did
not
talk
about
them
and
were
not
concerned
with
them
but
montague
was
familiar
with
the
saying
that
if
you
follow
the
chain
of
the
slave
you
will
find
the
other
end
about
the
wrist
of
the
master
and
he
discovered
that
the
tenderloin
was
wreaking
its
vengeance
upon
fifth
avenue
it
was
not
merely
that
the
men
of
wealth
were
carrying
to
their
wives
and
children
the
diseases
of
vice
they
were
carrying
also
the
manners
and
the
ideals
montague
had
been
amazed
by
the
things
he
had
found
in
new
york
society
the
smoking
and
drinking
and
gambling
of
women
their
hard
and
cynical
views
of
life
their
continual
telling
of
coarse
stories
and
here
in
this
he
had
come
upon
the
fountain
head
of
the
corruption
it
was
something
which
came
to
him
in
a
sudden
flash
of
intuition
the
barriers
between
the
two
worlds
were
breaking
down
he
could
picture
the
process
in
a
hundred
different
forms
there
was
betty
wyman
his
brother
had
meant
to
take
her
to
the
theatre
to
let
her
see
rosalie
by
way
of
a
joke
so
of
course
betty
knew
of
his
escapades
and
of
those
of
his
set
she
and
her
girl
friends
were
whispering
and
jesting
about
them
here
sat
oliver
smiling
and
cynical
toying
with
rosalie
as
a
cat
might
toy
with
a
mouse
and
he
would
be
with
betty
and
could
anyone
doubt
any
longer
whence
betty
had
derived
her
attitude
towards
life
and
the
habits
of
mind
that
oliver
had
taught
her
as
a
girl
she
would
not
forget
as
a
wife
he
might
be
anxious
to
keep
her
to
himself
but
there
would
be
others
whose
interest
was
different
and
montague
recalled
other
things
that
he
had
seen
or
heard
in
society
that
he
could
put
his
finger
upon
as
having
come
out
of
this
the
more
he
thought
of
the
explanation
the
more
it
seemed
to
explain
this
society
which
had
perplexed
him
now
he
could
describe
it
its
manners
and
ideals
of
life
were
those
which
he
would
have
expected
to
find
in
the
fast
side
of
stage
life
it
was
of
course
the
women
who
made
society
and
gave
it
its
tone
and
the
women
of
society
were
actresses
they
were
actresses
in
their
love
of
notoriety
and
display
in
their
taste
in
clothes
and
jewels
their
fondness
for
cigarettes
and
champagne
they
made
up
like
actresses
they
talked
and
thought
like
actresses
the
only
obvious
difference
was
that
the
women
of
the
stage
were
carefully
selected
were
at
least
up
to
a
certain
standard
of
physical
excellence
whereas
the
women
of
society
were
not
selected
at
all
and
some
were
lean
and
some
were
stout
and
some
were
painfully
homely
montague
recalled
cases
where
the
two
sets
had
met
as
at
some
of
the
private
entertainments
it
was
getting
to
be
the
fashion
to
hobnob
with
the
stage
people
on
such
occasions
and
he
recalled
how
naturally
the
younger
people
took
to
this
only
the
older
women
held
aloof
looking
down
upon
the
women
of
the
stage
from
an
ineffable
height
as
belonging
to
a
lower
caste
because
they
were
obliged
to
work
for
their
livings
but
it
seemed
to
montague
as
he
sat
and
talked
with
this
poor
who
had
sold
herself
for
a
little
pleasure
that
it
was
easier
to
pardon
her
than
the
woman
who
had
been
born
to
luxury
and
scorned
those
who
produced
her
wealth
but
most
of
all
one
sympathies
went
out
to
a
person
who
was
not
to
be
met
in
either
of
these
sets
to
the
girl
who
had
not
sold
herself
but
was
struggling
for
a
living
in
the
midst
of
this
ravening
corruption
there
were
thousands
of
women
even
on
the
stage
toodles
herself
had
been
among
them
she
told
montague
i
kept
straight
for
a
long
time
she
said
laughing
cheerfully
and
on
ten
dollars
a
week
i
used
to
go
out
on
the
road
and
then
they
paid
me
sixteen
and
think
of
trying
to
live
on
stands
to
board
yourself
and
stop
at
hotels
and
dress
for
the
theatre
on
sixteen
a
week
and
no
job
half
the
year
and
all
that
time
do
you
know
cyril
chambers
the
famous
church
painter
i
heard
of
him
said
montague
well
i
was
with
a
show
here
on
broadway
the
next
winter
and
every
night
for
six
months
he
sent
me
a
bunch
of
orchids
that
could
have
cost
less
than
dollars
and
he
told
me
he
open
accounts
for
me
in
all
the
stores
i
chose
if
i
spend
the
next
summer
in
europe
with
him
he
said
i
could
take
my
mother
or
my
sister
with
me
and
i
was
so
green
in
those
days
i
thought
that
must
mean
he
did
intend
anything
wrong
toodles
smiled
at
the
memory
did
you
go
asked
the
man
no
she
answered
i
stayed
here
with
a
show
that
failed
and
i
went
to
my
old
manager
for
a
job
and
he
said
to
me
can
only
pay
you
ten
a
week
but
why
are
you
so
foolish
do
you
mean
i
asked
and
he
answered
do
you
get
a
rich
sweetheart
then
i
could
pay
you
sixty
that
what
a
girl
hears
on
the
stage
i
do
understand
said
montague
perplexed
did
he
mean
he
could
get
money
out
of
the
man
not
directly
said
toodles
but
tickets
and
advertising
why
men
will
hire
seats
for
a
whole
season
if
they
interested
in
a
girl
in
the
show
and
they
take
all
their
friends
to
see
her
and
she
be
talked
about
she
be
somebody
instead
of
just
nobody
as
i
was
then
it
actually
helps
her
on
the
stage
said
montague
helps
her
exclaimed
toodles
my
god
i
known
a
girl
who
been
abroad
with
a
swell
and
had
the
gowns
and
the
jewels
to
prove
it
to
come
home
and
get
into
the
front
row
of
a
chorus
at
a
hundred
dollars
a
week
toodles
was
cheerful
and
all
unaware
and
that
only
made
the
tragedy
of
it
all
one
shade
more
black
to
montague
he
sat
lost
in
sombre
reverie
forgetting
his
companions
and
the
blare
and
glare
of
the
place
in
the
centre
of
this
was
a
great
stand
containing
a
display
of
food
and
as
they
strolled
out
montague
stopped
to
look
at
it
there
were
platters
garnished
with
flowers
and
herbs
and
containing
roast
turkeys
and
baked
hams
jellied
meats
and
game
in
aspic
puddings
and
tarts
and
frosted
cakes
every
kind
of
imaginable
one
might
have
spent
an
hour
in
studying
it
and
from
top
to
bottom
he
would
have
found
nothing
simple
nothing
natural
the
turkeys
had
paper
curls
and
rosettes
stuck
over
them
the
hams
were
covered
with
a
white
gelatine
the
devilled
crabs
with
a
yellow
all
painted
over
in
pink
and
green
and
black
with
landscapes
and
marine
views
with
ships
and
shoes
and
and
cabbages
and
kings
the
jellied
meats
and
the
puddings
were
in
the
shape
of
fruits
and
flowers
and
there
were
elaborate
works
of
art
in
pink
and
white
confectionery
a
for
instance
with
horses
and
cows
and
a
pump
and
a
dairymaid
and
one
or
two
alligators
and
all
this
was
changed
every
day
each
morning
you
might
see
a
procession
of
a
score
of
waiters
bearing
aloft
a
new
supply
montague
remembered
betty
wyman
remark
at
their
first
interview
apropos
of
the
whipped
cream
made
into
little
curleques
how
his
brother
had
said
if
allan
were
here
he
be
thinking
about
the
man
who
fixed
that
cream
and
how
long
it
took
him
and
how
he
might
have
been
reading
simple
life
he
thought
of
that
now
he
stood
here
and
gazed
and
wondered
about
all
the
slaves
of
the
lamp
who
served
in
this
huge
temple
of
luxury
he
looked
at
the
waiters
pale
men
he
imagined
the
hordes
of
servants
of
yet
lower
kinds
who
never
emerged
into
the
light
of
day
the
men
who
washed
the
dishes
the
men
who
carried
the
garbage
the
men
who
shovelled
the
coal
into
the
furnaces
and
made
the
heat
and
light
and
power
pent
up
in
dim
cellars
many
stories
under
ground
and
bound
for
ever
to
the
service
of
sensuality
how
terrible
must
be
their
fate
how
unimaginable
their
corruption
and
they
were
foreigners
they
had
come
here
seeking
liberty
and
the
masters
of
the
new
country
had
seized
them
and
pent
them
here
from
this
as
a
his
thought
went
on
to
the
hordes
of
toilers
in
every
part
of
the
world
whose
fate
it
was
to
create
the
things
which
these
blind
revellers
destroyed
the
women
and
children
in
countless
mills
and
sweatshops
who
spun
the
cloth
and
cut
and
sewed
it
the
girls
who
made
the
artificial
flowers
who
rolled
the
cigarettes
who
gathered
the
grapes
from
the
vines
the
miners
who
dug
the
coal
and
the
precious
metals
out
of
the
earth
the
men
who
watched
in
ten
thousand
and
engines
who
fought
the
elements
from
the
decks
of
ten
thousand
ships
to
bring
all
these
things
here
to
be
destroyed
step
by
step
as
the
flood
of
extravagance
rose
and
the
energies
of
the
men
were
turned
to
the
creation
of
futility
and
corruption
so
step
by
step
increased
the
misery
and
degradation
of
all
these
slaves
of
mammon
and
who
could
imagine
what
they
would
think
about
it
if
ever
they
came
to
think
and
then
in
a
sudden
flash
there
came
back
to
montague
that
speech
he
had
heard
upon
the
the
first
evening
he
had
been
in
new
york
he
could
hear
again
the
pounding
of
the
elevated
trains
and
the
shrill
voice
of
the
orator
he
could
see
his
haggard
and
hungry
face
and
the
dense
crowd
gazing
up
at
him
and
there
came
to
him
the
words
of
major
thorne
it
means
another
civil
war
chapter
xxi
alice
had
been
gone
for
a
couple
of
weeks
and
the
day
was
drawing
near
when
the
hasbrook
case
came
up
for
trial
the
saturday
before
that
being
the
date
of
the
dance
of
the
long
island
hunt
club
siegfried
harvey
was
to
have
a
for
the
and
montague
accepted
his
invitation
he
had
been
working
hard
putting
the
finishing
touches
to
his
brief
and
he
thought
that
a
rest
would
be
good
for
him
he
and
his
brother
went
down
upon
friday
afternoon
and
the
first
person
he
met
was
betty
wyman
whom
he
had
not
seen
for
quite
a
while
betty
had
much
to
say
and
said
it
as
montague
had
not
been
seen
with
winnie
since
the
episode
in
her
house
people
had
begun
to
notice
the
break
and
there
was
no
end
of
gossip
and
mistress
betty
wanted
to
know
all
about
it
and
how
things
stood
between
them
but
he
would
not
tell
her
and
so
she
saucily
refused
to
tell
him
what
she
had
heard
all
the
while
they
talked
she
was
eyeing
him
quizzically
and
it
was
evident
that
she
took
the
worst
for
granted
also
that
he
had
become
a
much
more
interesting
person
to
her
because
of
it
montague
had
the
strangest
sensations
when
he
was
talking
with
betty
wyman
she
was
delicious
and
appealing
almost
irresistible
and
yet
her
views
of
life
were
so
old
i
told
you
you
would
do
for
a
tame
cat
she
said
to
him
then
she
went
on
to
talk
to
him
about
his
case
and
to
tease
him
about
the
disturbance
he
had
made
you
know
she
said
ollie
and
i
were
in
terror
we
thought
that
grandfather
would
be
furious
and
that
we
be
ruined
but
somehow
it
did
work
out
that
way
do
you
say
anything
about
it
but
i
had
a
sort
of
a
fancy
that
he
must
be
on
your
side
of
the
fence
i
be
glad
to
know
it
said
montague
with
a
laugh
i
been
trying
for
a
long
time
to
find
out
who
is
on
my
side
of
the
fence
he
was
talking
about
it
the
other
day
said
betty
and
i
heard
him
tell
a
man
that
he
read
your
argument
and
thought
it
was
good
i
glad
to
hear
that
said
montague
so
was
i
replied
she
and
i
said
to
him
afterward
suppose
you
do
know
that
allan
montague
is
my
ollie
brother
and
he
did
you
the
honour
to
say
that
he
had
supposed
any
member
of
ollie
family
could
have
as
much
sense
betty
was
staying
with
an
aunt
near
by
and
she
went
back
before
dinner
in
the
automobile
which
came
for
her
was
old
wyman
himself
on
his
way
home
from
the
city
and
as
a
snowstorm
had
begun
he
came
in
and
stood
by
the
fire
while
his
car
was
exchanged
for
a
closed
one
from
harvey
stables
montague
did
not
meet
him
but
stood
and
watched
him
from
the
mite
of
a
man
with
a
keen
and
eager
face
full
of
wrinkles
it
was
hard
to
realize
that
this
little
body
held
one
of
the
great
driving
minds
of
the
country
he
was
an
intensely
nervous
and
irritable
man
bitter
and
implacable
by
all
odds
the
most
hated
and
feared
man
in
wall
street
he
was
swift
imperious
savage
as
a
hornet
directors
at
meetings
that
i
attend
vote
first
and
discuss
afterward
was
one
of
his
sayings
that
montague
had
heard
quoted
watching
him
here
by
the
fireside
rubbing
his
hands
and
chatting
pleasantly
montague
had
a
sudden
sense
of
being
behind
the
scenes
of
being
admitted
to
a
privilege
denied
to
ordinary
mortals
the
beholding
of
royalty
in
everyday
attire
after
dinner
that
evening
montague
had
a
chat
in
the
with
his
host
and
he
brought
up
the
subject
of
the
hasbrook
case
and
told
about
his
trip
to
washington
and
his
interview
with
judge
ellis
harvey
also
had
something
to
communicate
i
had
a
talk
with
freddie
vandam
about
it
said
he
what
did
he
say
asked
montague
well
replied
the
other
with
a
laugh
he
indignant
needless
to
say
you
know
freddie
was
brought
up
by
his
father
to
regard
the
fidelity
as
his
property
in
a
way
he
always
refers
to
it
as
company
and
he
very
high
and
mighty
about
it
it
a
personal
affront
if
anyone
attacks
it
but
it
was
evident
to
me
that
he
know
who
behind
this
case
did
he
know
about
ellis
asked
montague
yes
said
the
other
he
had
found
out
that
much
it
was
he
who
told
me
that
originally
he
says
that
ellis
has
been
sponging
off
the
company
for
years
he
has
a
big
salary
that
he
never
earns
and
has
borrowed
something
like
a
quarter
of
a
million
dollars
on
worthless
securities
montague
gave
a
gasp
yes
laughed
harvey
but
after
all
that
a
little
matter
the
trouble
with
freddie
vandam
is
that
that
sort
of
thing
is
all
he
sees
and
so
he
never
be
able
to
make
out
the
mystery
he
knows
that
this
clique
or
that
in
the
company
is
plotting
to
get
some
advantage
or
to
use
him
for
their
purposes
but
he
never
realizes
how
the
big
men
are
pulling
the
wires
behind
the
scenes
some
day
they
throw
him
overboard
altogether
and
then
he
realize
how
they
played
with
him
that
what
this
hasbrook
case
means
you
know
they
simply
want
to
frighten
him
with
a
threat
of
getting
the
company
affairs
into
the
courts
and
the
newspapers
montague
sat
for
a
while
in
deep
thought
what
would
you
think
would
be
wyman
relation
to
the
matter
he
asked
at
last
i
would
know
said
harvey
he
supposed
to
be
backer
but
what
can
you
tell
in
such
a
tangle
it
is
certainly
a
mess
said
montague
there
no
bottom
to
it
said
the
other
absolutely
it
would
take
your
breath
away
just
listen
to
what
vandam
told
me
and
then
harvey
named
one
of
the
directors
of
the
fidelity
who
was
well
known
as
a
philanthropist
having
heard
that
the
wife
of
one
of
his
junior
partners
had
met
with
an
accident
in
childbirth
and
that
the
doctor
had
told
her
husband
that
if
she
ever
had
another
child
she
would
die
this
man
had
asked
why
do
you
have
her
life
insured
the
other
replied
that
he
had
tried
and
the
companies
had
refused
her
i
fix
it
for
you
said
he
and
so
they
put
in
another
application
and
the
director
came
to
freddie
vandam
and
had
the
policy
put
through
by
executive
order
seven
months
later
the
woman
died
and
the
fidelity
had
paid
her
husband
in
full
a
hundred
thousand
or
two
that
what
going
on
in
the
insurance
world
said
siegfried
harvey
and
that
was
the
story
which
montague
took
with
him
to
add
to
his
enjoyment
of
the
festivities
at
the
country
club
it
was
a
very
gorgeous
affair
but
perhaps
the
sombreness
of
his
thoughts
was
to
blame
the
flowers
and
music
and
beautiful
gowns
failed
entirely
in
their
appeal
and
he
saw
only
the
gluttony
and
drunkenness
more
of
it
than
ever
before
it
seemed
to
him
then
too
he
had
an
unpleasant
experience
he
met
laura
hegan
and
presuming
upon
her
cordial
reception
of
his
visit
he
went
up
and
spoke
to
her
pleasantly
and
she
greeted
him
with
frigid
politeness
she
was
so
brief
in
her
remarks
and
turned
away
so
abruptly
as
almost
to
snub
him
he
went
away
quite
bewildered
but
later
on
he
recalled
the
gossip
about
himself
and
winnie
and
he
guessed
that
that
was
the
explanation
of
miss
hegar
action
the
episode
threw
a
shadow
over
his
whole
visit
on
sunday
he
went
out
into
the
country
and
tramped
through
a
snowstorm
by
himself
filled
with
a
sense
of
disgust
for
all
the
past
and
of
foreboding
for
the
future
he
hated
this
in
which
all
that
was
worst
in
human
beings
was
brought
to
the
surface
he
hated
it
and
wished
that
he
had
never
set
foot
within
its
bounds
it
was
only
by
tramping
until
he
was
too
tired
to
feel
anything
that
he
was
able
to
master
himself
and
then
toward
dark
he
came
back
and
found
a
telegram
which
had
been
forwarded
from
new
york
meet
me
at
the
penna
depot
jersey
city
at
nine
alice
this
message
of
course
drove
all
other
thoughts
from
his
mind
he
had
no
time
even
to
tell
oliver
about
it
he
had
to
jump
into
an
automobile
and
rush
to
catch
the
next
train
for
the
city
and
all
through
the
long
cold
ride
in
and
cabs
he
pondered
this
mystery
alice
party
had
not
been
expected
for
two
weeks
yet
and
only
two
days
before
there
had
come
a
letter
from
los
angeles
saying
that
they
would
probably
be
a
week
over
time
and
here
she
was
home
again
he
found
there
was
an
express
from
the
west
due
at
the
hour
named
apparently
therefore
alice
had
not
come
in
the
prentice
train
at
all
the
express
was
half
an
hour
late
and
so
he
paced
up
and
down
the
platform
controlling
his
impatience
as
best
he
could
and
finally
the
long
train
pulled
in
and
he
saw
alice
coming
down
the
platform
she
was
alone
what
does
it
mean
were
the
first
words
he
said
to
her
it
a
long
story
she
answered
i
wanted
to
come
home
you
mean
you
come
all
the
way
from
the
coast
by
yourself
he
gasped
yes
she
said
all
the
way
what
in
the
world
he
began
i
ca
tell
you
here
allan
she
said
wait
till
we
get
to
some
quiet
place
but
he
persisted
the
prentice
they
let
you
come
home
alone
they
did
know
it
she
said
i
ran
away
he
was
more
bewildered
than
ever
but
as
he
started
to
ask
more
questions
she
laid
a
hand
upon
his
arm
please
wait
allan
she
said
it
upsets
me
to
talk
about
it
it
was
charlie
carter
and
so
the
light
broke
he
caught
his
breath
and
gasped
oh
he
said
not
another
word
until
they
had
crossed
the
ferry
and
settled
themselves
in
a
cab
and
started
now
he
said
tell
me
alice
began
i
was
very
much
upset
she
said
but
you
must
understand
allan
that
i
had
nearly
a
week
to
think
it
over
and
i
do
mind
it
now
so
i
want
you
please
not
to
get
excited
about
it
it
was
poor
charlie
fault
he
ca
help
himself
it
was
my
mistake
i
ought
to
have
taken
your
advice
and
had
nothing
to
do
with
him
go
on
said
he
and
alice
told
her
story
the
party
had
gone
and
she
had
had
a
headache
and
had
stayed
in
the
car
and
charlie
carter
had
come
and
begun
making
love
to
her
he
had
asked
me
to
marry
him
already
that
was
at
the
beginning
of
the
trip
she
said
and
i
told
him
no
after
that
he
would
never
let
me
alone
and
this
time
he
went
on
in
a
terrible
way
he
flung
himself
down
on
his
knees
and
wept
and
said
he
could
live
without
me
and
nothing
i
could
say
did
any
good
at
last
he
he
caught
hold
of
me
and
he
would
let
me
go
i
was
furious
with
him
and
frightened
i
had
to
threaten
to
call
for
help
before
he
would
stop
and
so
you
see
how
it
was
i
see
said
montague
gravely
go
on
well
after
that
i
made
up
my
mind
that
i
could
stay
anywhere
where
i
had
to
see
him
and
i
knew
he
would
never
go
away
without
a
scene
if
i
had
asked
prentice
to
send
him
away
there
would
have
been
a
scandal
and
it
would
have
spoiled
everybody
trip
so
i
went
out
and
found
there
was
a
train
for
the
east
in
a
little
while
and
i
packed
up
my
things
and
left
a
note
for
prentice
i
told
her
a
story
i
said
i
had
a
telegram
that
your
mother
was
ill
and
that
i
want
to
spoil
their
good
time
and
had
gone
by
myself
that
was
the
best
thing
i
could
think
of
i
was
afraid
to
travel
so
long
as
i
was
sure
that
charlie
could
catch
up
with
me
montague
said
nothing
he
sat
with
his
hands
gripped
tightly
it
seemed
like
a
desperate
thing
to
do
said
alice
nervously
but
you
see
i
was
upset
and
unhappy
i
did
seem
to
like
the
party
any
more
i
wanted
to
be
home
do
you
understand
yes
said
montague
i
understand
and
i
glad
you
are
here
they
reached
home
and
montague
called
up
harvey
and
told
his
brother
what
had
happened
he
could
hear
oliver
gasp
with
astonishment
a
pretty
he
said
when
he
had
got
his
breath
back
and
then
he
added
with
a
laugh
i
suppose
that
settles
poor
chances
i
glad
you
come
to
that
conclusion
said
the
other
as
he
hung
up
the
receiver
this
episode
gave
montague
quite
a
shock
but
he
had
little
time
to
think
about
it
the
next
morning
at
eleven
his
case
was
to
come
up
for
trial
and
so
all
his
thoughts
were
called
away
this
case
had
been
the
one
real
interest
of
his
life
for
the
last
three
months
it
was
his
purpose
the
thing
for
the
sake
of
which
he
endured
everything
else
that
repelled
him
and
he
had
trained
himself
as
an
athlete
for
a
great
race
he
was
in
form
and
ready
for
the
effort
of
his
life
he
went
down
town
that
morning
with
every
fibre
of
him
body
and
mind
alert
and
eager
and
he
went
into
his
office
and
in
his
mail
was
a
letter
from
hasbrook
he
opened
it
hastily
and
read
a
message
brief
and
direct
and
decisive
as
a
i
beg
to
inform
you
that
i
have
received
a
satisfactory
proposition
from
the
fidelity
company
i
have
settled
with
them
and
wish
to
withdraw
the
suit
thanking
you
for
your
services
i
remain
sincerely
to
montague
the
thing
came
like
a
thunderbolt
he
sat
utterly
dumbfounded
his
hands
went
limp
and
the
letter
fell
upon
the
desk
in
front
of
him
and
at
last
when
he
did
move
he
picked
up
the
telephone
and
told
his
secretary
to
call
up
hasbrook
then
he
sat
waiting
and
when
the
bell
rang
picked
up
the
receiver
expecting
to
hear
voice
and
to
demand
an
explanation
but
he
heard
instead
the
voice
of
his
own
secretary
central
says
the
number
been
discontinued
sir
and
he
hung
up
the
receiver
and
sat
motionless
again
the
dummy
had
disappeared
to
montague
this
incident
meant
a
change
in
the
prospect
of
his
whole
life
it
was
the
collapse
of
all
his
hopes
he
had
nothing
more
to
work
for
nothing
more
to
think
about
the
bottom
had
fallen
out
of
his
career
he
was
burning
with
a
sense
of
outrage
he
had
been
tricked
and
made
a
fool
of
he
had
been
used
and
flung
aside
and
now
there
was
nothing
he
could
do
he
was
utterly
helpless
what
affected
him
most
was
his
sense
of
the
overwhelming
magnitude
of
the
powers
which
had
made
him
their
puppet
of
the
utter
futility
of
the
efforts
that
he
or
any
other
man
could
make
against
them
they
were
like
elemental
cosmic
forces
they
held
all
the
world
in
their
grip
and
a
common
man
was
as
much
at
their
mercy
as
a
bit
of
chaff
in
a
tempest
all
day
long
he
sat
in
his
office
brooding
and
nursing
his
wrath
he
had
moods
when
he
wished
to
drop
everything
to
shake
the
dust
of
the
city
from
his
feet
and
go
back
home
and
recollect
what
it
was
to
be
a
gentleman
and
then
again
he
had
fighting
moods
when
he
wished
to
devote
all
his
life
to
punishing
the
men
who
had
made
use
of
him
he
would
get
hold
of
some
other
in
the
fidelity
one
whom
he
could
trust
he
would
take
the
case
without
pay
and
carry
it
through
to
the
end
he
would
force
the
newspapers
to
talk
about
it
he
would
force
the
people
to
heed
what
he
said
and
then
toward
evening
he
went
home
bitter
and
sore
and
there
was
his
brother
sitting
in
his
study
waiting
for
him
hello
he
said
and
took
off
his
coat
preparing
his
mind
for
one
more
ignominy
the
telling
of
his
misfortune
to
oliver
and
listening
to
his
inevitable
i
told
you
so
but
oliver
himself
had
something
to
communicate
something
that
would
not
bear
keeping
he
broke
out
at
once
tell
me
allan
what
in
the
world
has
happened
between
you
and
mrs
winnie
what
do
you
mean
asked
montague
sharply
why
said
oliver
everybody
is
talking
about
some
kind
of
a
quarrel
there
has
been
no
quarrel
said
montague
well
what
is
it
then
it
nothing
it
must
be
something
exclaimed
oliver
what
do
all
the
stories
mean
what
stories
about
you
two
i
met
vivie
patton
just
now
and
she
swore
me
to
secrecy
and
told
me
that
winnie
had
told
some
one
that
you
had
made
love
to
her
so
outrageously
that
she
had
to
ask
you
to
leave
the
house
montague
shrunk
as
from
a
blow
oh
he
gasped
that
what
she
said
said
he
it
a
lie
he
cried
that
what
i
told
vivie
said
the
other
it
does
sound
like
you
montague
had
flushed
scarlet
i
do
mean
that
he
cried
i
mean
that
winnie
never
said
any
such
thing
oh
said
oliver
and
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
maybe
not
he
added
but
i
know
she
furious
with
you
about
something
talking
about
it
she
tells
people
that
she
never
speak
to
you
again
and
what
i
want
to
know
is
why
is
it
that
you
have
to
do
things
to
make
enemies
of
everybody
you
know
montague
said
nothing
he
was
trembling
with
anger
what
in
the
world
did
you
do
to
her
began
the
other
ca
you
trust
me
and
suddenly
montague
sprang
to
his
feet
oh
oliver
he
exclaimed
let
me
alone
go
away
and
he
went
into
the
next
room
and
slammed
the
door
and
began
pacing
back
and
forth
like
a
caged
animal
it
was
a
lie
it
was
a
lie
winnie
had
never
said
such
a
thing
he
would
never
believe
it
it
was
a
nasty
piece
of
backstairs
gossip
but
then
a
new
burst
of
rage
swept
over
him
what
did
it
matter
whether
it
was
true
or
not
whether
anything
was
true
or
not
what
did
it
matter
if
anybody
had
done
all
the
hideous
and
loathsome
things
that
everybody
else
said
they
had
done
it
was
what
everybody
was
saying
it
was
what
everybody
believed
what
everybody
was
interested
in
it
was
the
measure
of
a
whole
society
their
ideals
and
their
standards
it
was
the
way
they
spent
their
time
repeating
nasty
scandals
about
each
other
living
in
an
atmosphere
of
suspicion
and
cynicism
with
endless
whispering
and
leering
and
gossip
of
lew
intrigue
a
flood
of
rage
surged
up
within
him
and
swept
him
away
rage
against
the
world
into
which
he
had
come
and
against
himself
for
the
part
he
had
played
in
it
everything
seemed
to
have
come
to
a
head
at
once
and
he
hated
everything
hated
the
people
he
had
met
and
the
things
they
did
and
the
things
they
had
tempted
him
to
do
he
hated
the
way
he
had
got
his
money
and
the
way
he
had
spent
it
he
hated
the
idleness
and
wastefulness
the
drunkenness
and
debauchery
the
meanness
and
the
snobbishness
and
suddenly
he
turned
and
flung
open
the
door
of
the
room
where
oliver
still
sat
and
he
stood
in
the
doorway
exclaiming
oliver
i
done
with
it
oliver
stared
at
him
what
do
you
mean
he
asked
i
mean
cried
his
brother
that
i
had
all
i
can
stand
of
and
i
going
to
quit
you
can
go
on
but
i
do
intend
to
take
another
step

you

enough

enough

your
hands
