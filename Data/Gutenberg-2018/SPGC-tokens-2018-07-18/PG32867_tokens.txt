a
boy
whom
i
knew
very
well
was
once
going
through
a
meadow
which
was
full
of
buttercups
the
nurse
and
his
baby
sister
were
with
him
and
when
they
got
to
an
old
hawthorn
which
grew
in
the
hedge
and
was
covered
with
blossom
they
all
sat
down
in
its
shade
and
the
nurse
took
out
three
slices
of
gave
one
to
each
of
the
children
and
kept
one
for
herself
while
the
boy
was
eating
he
observed
that
this
hedge
was
very
high
and
thick
and
that
there
was
a
great
hollow
in
the
trunk
of
the
old
and
he
heard
a
twittering
as
if
there
was
a
nest
somewhere
inside
so
he
thrust
his
head
in
twisted
himself
round
and
looked
up
it
was
a
very
great
and
the
hollow
was
so
large
that
two
or
three
boys
could
have
stood
upright
in
it
and
when
he
got
used
to
the
dim
light
in
that
brown
still
place
he
saw
that
a
good
way
above
his
head
there
was
a
nest
rather
a
curious
one
too
for
it
was
as
large
as
a
pair
of
blackbirds
would
have
built
and
yet
it
was
made
of
fine
white
wool
and
delicate
bits
of
moss
in
short
it
was
like
a
goldfinch
nest
magnified
three
times
just
then
he
thought
he
heard
some
little
voices
cry
jack
jack
his
baby
sister
was
asleep
and
the
nurse
was
reading
a
so
it
could
not
have
been
either
of
them
who
called
i
must
get
in
here
said
the
boy
i
wish
this
hole
was
larger
so
he
began
to
wriggle
and
twist
himself
through
and
just
as
he
pulled
in
his
last
foot
he
looked
up
and
three
heads
which
had
been
peeping
over
the
edge
of
the
nest
suddenly
popped
down
again
those
heads
had
no
beaks
i
am
sure
said
jack
and
he
stood
on
tiptoe
and
poked
in
one
of
his
fingers
and
the
things
have
no
feathers
he
continued
so
the
hollow
being
rather
rugged
he
managed
to
climb
up
and
look
in
his
eyes
were
not
used
yet
to
the
dim
light
but
he
was
sure
those
things
were
not
birds
no
he
poked
them
and
they
took
no
notice
but
when
he
snatched
one
of
them
out
of
the
nest
it
gave
a
loud
squeak
and
said
o
do
jack
as
plainly
as
possible
upon
which
he
was
so
frightened
that
he
lost
his
footing
dropped
the
thing
and
slipped
down
himself
luckily
he
was
not
hurt
nor
the
thing
either
he
could
see
it
quite
plainly
now
it
was
creeping
about
like
rather
an
old
baby
and
had
on
a
little
frock
and
pinafore
it
a
fairy
exclaimed
jack
to
himself
how
curious
and
this
must
be
a
fairy
nest
oh
how
angry
the
old
mother
will
be
if
this
little
thing
creeps
away
and
gets
out
of
the
hole
so
he
looked
down
oh
the
hole
is
on
the
other
side
he
said
and
he
turned
round
but
the
hole
was
not
on
the
other
side
it
was
not
on
any
side
it
must
have
closed
up
all
on
a
sudden
while
he
was
looking
into
the
nest
for
look
whichever
way
he
would
there
was
no
hole
at
all
excepting
a
very
little
one
high
up
over
the
nest
which
let
in
a
very
small
sunbeam
jack
was
very
much
astonished
but
he
went
on
eating
his
cake
and
was
so
delighted
to
see
the
young
fairy
climb
up
the
side
of
the
hollow
and
scramble
again
into
her
nest
that
he
laughed
heartily
upon
which
all
the
nestlings
popped
up
their
heads
and
showing
their
pretty
white
teeth
pointed
at
the
slice
of
cake
well
said
jack
i
may
have
to
stay
inside
here
for
a
long
time
and
i
have
nothing
to
eat
but
this
cake
however
your
mouths
are
very
small
so
you
shall
have
a
piece
and
he
broke
off
a
small
piece
and
put
it
into
the
nest
climbing
up
to
see
them
eat
it
these
young
fairies
were
a
long
time
dividing
and
munching
the
cake
and
before
they
had
finished
it
began
to
be
rather
dark
for
a
black
cloud
came
over
and
covered
the
little
sunbeam
at
the
same
time
the
wind
rose
and
rocked
the
boughs
and
made
the
old
tree
creak
and
tremble
then
there
was
thunder
and
rain
and
the
little
fairies
were
so
frightened
that
they
got
out
of
the
nest
and
crept
into
pockets
one
got
into
each
waistcoat
pocket
and
the
other
two
were
very
comfortable
for
he
took
out
his
handkerchief
and
made
room
for
them
in
the
pocket
of
his
jacket
it
got
darker
and
darker
till
at
last
jack
could
only
just
see
the
hole
and
it
seemed
to
be
a
very
long
way
off
every
time
he
looked
at
it
it
was
farther
off
and
at
last
he
saw
a
thin
crescent
moon
shining
through
it
i
am
sure
it
can
not
be
night
yet
he
said
and
he
took
out
one
of
the
fattest
of
the
young
fairies
and
held
it
up
towards
the
hole
look
at
that
said
he
what
is
to
be
done
now
the
hole
is
so
far
off
that
it
night
up
there
and
down
here
i
have
done
eating
my
lunch
well
answered
the
young
fairy
then
why
do
you
whistle
jack
was
surprised
to
hear
her
speak
in
this
sensible
manner
and
in
the
light
of
the
moon
he
looked
at
her
very
attentively
when
first
i
saw
you
in
the
nest
said
he
you
had
a
pinafore
on
and
now
you
have
a
smart
little
apron
with
lace
round
it
that
is
because
i
am
much
older
now
said
the
fairy
we
never
take
such
a
long
time
to
grow
up
as
you
do
but
your
pinafore
said
jack
turned
into
an
apron
of
course
replied
the
fairy
just
as
your
velvet
jacket
will
turn
into
a
when
you
are
old
enough
it
wo
said
jack
yes
it
will
answered
the
fairy
with
an
air
of
superior
wisdom
do
argue
with
me
i
am
older
now
than
you
are
nearly
grown
up
in
fact
put
me
into
your
pocket
again
and
whistle
as
loudly
as
you
can
jack
laughed
put
her
in
and
pulled
out
another
worse
and
worse
he
said
why
this
was
a
boy
fairy
and
now
he
has
a
mustache
and
a
sword
and
looks
as
fierce
as
possible
i
think
i
heard
my
sister
tell
you
to
whistle
said
this
fairy
very
sternly
yes
she
did
said
jack
well
i
suppose
i
had
better
do
it
so
he
whistled
very
loudly
indeed
why
did
you
leave
off
so
soon
said
another
of
them
peeping
out
why
if
you
wish
to
know
answered
jack
it
was
because
i
thought
something
took
hold
of
my
legs
ridiculous
child
cried
the
last
of
the
four
how
do
you
think
you
are
ever
to
get
out
if
she
does
take
hold
of
your
legs
jack
thought
he
would
rather
have
done
a
sum
than
have
been
obliged
to
whistle
but
he
could
not
help
doing
it
when
they
told
him
and
he
felt
something
take
hold
of
his
legs
again
and
then
give
him
a
jerk
which
hoisted
him
on
to
its
back
where
he
sat
astride
and
wondered
whether
the
thing
was
a
pony
but
it
was
not
for
he
presently
observed
that
it
had
a
very
slender
neck
and
then
that
it
was
covered
with
feathers
it
was
a
large
bird
and
he
presently
found
that
they
were
rising
towards
the
hole
which
had
become
so
very
far
off
and
in
a
few
minutes
she
dashed
through
the
hole
with
jack
on
her
back
and
all
the
fairies
in
his
pockets
it
was
so
dark
that
he
could
see
nothing
and
he
twined
his
arms
round
the
bird
neck
to
hold
on
upon
which
this
agreeable
fowl
told
him
not
to
be
afraid
and
said
she
hoped
he
was
comfortable
i
should
be
more
comfortable
replied
jack
if
i
knew
how
i
could
get
home
again
i
do
wish
to
go
home
just
yet
for
i
want
to
see
where
we
are
flying
to
but
papa
and
mamma
will
be
frightened
if
i
never
do
oh
no
replied
the
albatross
for
she
was
an
albatross
you
need
not
be
at
all
afraid
about
that
when
boys
go
to
fairyland
their
parents
never
are
uneasy
about
them
really
exclaimed
jack
quite
true
replied
the
albatross
and
so
we
are
going
to
fairyland
exclaimed
jack
how
delightful
yes
said
the
albatross
the
back
way
mind
we
are
only
going
the
back
way
you
could
go
in
two
minutes
by
the
usual
route
but
these
young
fairies
want
to
go
before
they
are
summoned
and
therefore
you
and
i
are
taking
them
and
she
continued
to
fly
on
in
the
dark
sky
for
a
very
long
time
they
seem
to
be
all
fast
asleep
said
jack
perhaps
they
will
sleep
till
we
come
to
the
wonderful
river
replied
the
albatross
and
just
then
she
flew
with
a
great
bump
against
something
that
met
her
in
the
air
what
craft
is
this
that
hangs
out
no
light
said
a
gruff
voice
i
might
ask
the
same
question
of
you
answered
the
albatross
sullenly
i
only
a
poor
replied
the
voice
and
you
know
very
well
that
i
have
but
a
lantern
to
show
thereupon
a
lantern
became
visible
and
jack
saw
by
the
light
of
it
a
man
who
looked
old
and
tired
and
he
was
so
transparent
that
you
could
see
through
him
lantern
and
all
i
hope
i
have
not
hurt
you
william
said
the
albatross
i
will
light
up
immediately
answered
the
i
am
going
down
as
fast
as
i
can
the
storm
blew
me
up
and
i
am
never
easy
excepting
in
my
native
swamps
jack
might
have
taken
more
notice
of
will
if
the
albatross
had
not
begun
to
light
up
she
did
it
in
this
way
first
one
of
her
eyes
began
to
gleam
with
a
beautiful
green
light
which
cast
its
rays
far
and
near
and
then
when
it
was
as
bright
as
a
lamp
the
other
eye
began
to
shine
and
the
light
of
that
eye
was
red
in
short
she
was
lighted
up
just
like
a
vessel
at
sea
jack
was
so
happy
that
he
hardly
knew
which
to
look
at
first
there
really
were
so
many
remarkable
things
they
snore
said
the
albatross
they
are
very
fast
asleep
and
before
they
wake
i
should
like
to
talk
to
you
a
little
she
meant
that
the
fairies
snored
and
so
they
did
in
pockets
my
name
continued
the
albatross
is
jenny
do
you
think
you
shall
remember
that
because
when
you
are
in
fairyland
and
want
some
one
to
take
you
home
again
and
call
i
shall
be
able
to
come
to
you
and
i
shall
come
with
pleasure
for
i
like
boys
better
than
fairies
thank
you
said
jack
oh
yes
i
shall
remember
your
name
it
is
such
a
very
easy
one
if
it
is
in
the
night
that
you
want
me
just
look
up
continued
the
albatross
and
you
will
see
a
green
and
a
red
spark
moving
in
the
air
you
will
then
call
jenny
and
i
will
come
but
remember
that
i
can
not
come
unless
you
do
call
me
very
well
said
jack
but
he
was
not
attending
because
there
was
so
much
to
be
seen
in
the
first
place
all
the
stars
excepting
a
few
large
ones
were
gone
and
they
looked
frightened
and
as
it
got
lighter
one
after
the
other
seemed
to
give
a
little
start
in
the
blue
sky
and
go
out
and
then
jack
looked
down
and
saw
as
he
thought
a
great
country
covered
with
very
jagged
snow
mountains
with
astonishingly
sharp
peaks
here
and
there
he
saw
a
very
deep
lake
at
least
he
thought
it
was
a
lake
but
while
he
was
admiring
the
mountains
there
came
an
enormous
crack
between
two
of
the
largest
and
he
saw
the
sun
come
rolling
up
among
them
and
it
seemed
to
be
almost
smothered
why
those
are
clouds
exclaimed
jack
and
o
how
rosy
they
have
all
turned
i
thought
they
were
mountains
yes
they
are
clouds
said
the
albatross
and
then
they
turned
gold
color
and
next
they
began
to
plunge
and
tumble
and
every
one
of
the
peaks
put
on
a
glittering
crown
and
next
they
broke
themselves
to
pieces
and
began
to
drift
away
in
fact
jack
had
been
out
all
night
and
now
it
was
morning
chapter
ii
captain
jack
it
has
been
our
lot
to
sail
with
many
captains
not
one
of
whom
is
fit
to
be
a
patch
on
your
back
of
the
ship
company
of
royalist
to
captain
all
this
time
the
albatross
kept
dropping
down
and
down
like
a
stone
till
jack
was
quite
out
of
breath
and
they
fell
or
flew
whichever
you
like
to
call
it
straight
through
one
of
the
great
chasms
which
he
had
thought
were
lakes
and
he
looked
down
as
he
sat
on
the
back
to
see
what
the
world
is
like
when
you
hang
a
good
way
above
it
at
sunrise
it
was
a
very
beautiful
sight
the
sheep
and
lambs
were
still
fast
asleep
on
the
green
hills
and
the
were
asleep
in
long
rows
upon
the
ledges
of
the
cliffs
with
their
heads
under
their
wings
are
those
young
fairies
awake
yet
asked
the
albatross
as
sound
asleep
as
ever
answered
jack
but
albatross
is
not
that
the
sea
which
lies
under
us
you
are
a
i
know
but
i
am
not
a
sea
boy
and
i
can
not
live
in
the
water
yes
that
is
the
sea
answered
the
albatross
do
you
observe
that
it
is
covered
with
ships
i
see
boats
and
vessels
answered
jack
and
all
their
sails
are
set
but
they
can
not
sail
because
there
is
no
wind
the
wind
never
does
blow
in
this
great
bay
said
the
bird
and
those
ships
would
all
lie
there
becalmed
till
they
dropped
to
pieces
if
one
of
them
was
not
wanted
now
and
then
to
go
up
the
wonderful
river
but
how
did
they
come
there
asked
jack
some
of
them
had
captains
who
their
some
were
pirate
ships
and
others
were
going
out
on
evil
errands
the
consequence
was
that
when
they
chanced
to
sail
within
this
great
bay
they
got
becalmed
the
fairies
came
and
picked
all
the
sailors
out
and
threw
them
into
the
water
they
then
took
away
the
flags
and
pennons
to
make
their
best
coats
of
threw
the
and
other
provisions
to
the
fishes
and
set
all
the
sails
many
ships
which
are
supposed
by
men
to
have
foundered
lie
becalmed
in
this
quiet
sea
look
at
those
five
grand
ones
with
high
prows
they
are
moored
close
together
they
were
part
of
the
spanish
armada
and
those
open
boats
with
blue
sails
belonged
to
the
romans
they
sailed
with
cæsar
when
he
invaded
britain
by
this
time
the
albatross
was
hovering
about
among
the
vessels
making
choice
of
one
to
take
jack
and
the
fairies
up
the
wonderful
river
it
must
not
be
a
large
one
she
said
for
the
river
in
some
places
is
very
shallow
jack
would
have
liked
very
much
to
have
a
fine
all
to
himself
but
then
he
considered
that
he
did
not
know
anything
about
sails
and
rigging
he
thought
it
would
be
just
as
well
to
be
contented
with
whatever
the
albatross
might
choose
so
he
let
her
set
him
down
in
a
beautiful
little
open
boat
with
a
great
carved
to
it
there
he
seated
himself
in
great
state
and
the
albatross
perched
herself
on
the
next
bench
and
faced
him
you
remember
my
name
asked
the
albatross
oh
yes
said
jack
but
he
was
not
attending
he
was
thinking
what
a
fine
thing
it
was
to
have
such
a
curious
boat
all
to
himself
that
well
answered
the
bird
then
in
the
next
place
are
those
fairies
awake
yet
no
they
are
not
said
jack
and
he
took
them
out
of
his
pockets
and
laid
them
down
in
a
row
before
the
albatross
they
are
certainly
asleep
said
the
bird
put
them
away
again
and
take
great
care
of
them
mind
you
do
lose
any
of
them
for
i
really
do
know
what
will
happen
if
you
do
now
i
have
one
thing
more
to
say
to
you
and
that
is
are
you
hungry
rather
said
jack
then
replied
the
albatross
as
soon
as
you
feel
hungry
lie
down
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
and
go
to
sleep
you
will
dream
that
you
see
before
you
a
roasted
fowl
some
new
potatoes
and
an
mind
you
do
eat
too
much
in
your
dream
or
you
will
be
sorry
for
it
when
you
wake
that
is
all
i
must
go
jack
put
his
arms
round
the
neck
of
the
bird
and
hugged
her
then
she
spread
her
magnificent
wings
and
sailed
slowly
away
at
first
he
felt
very
lonely
but
in
a
few
minutes
he
forgot
that
because
the
little
boat
began
to
swim
so
fast
she
was
not
sailing
for
she
had
no
sail
and
he
was
not
rowing
for
he
had
no
oars
so
i
am
obliged
to
call
her
motion
swimming
because
i
do
know
of
a
better
word
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
they
passed
close
under
the
bows
of
a
splendid
a
ship
the
gannets
who
live
in
those
parts
had
taken
possession
of
her
and
she
was
so
covered
with
nests
that
you
could
not
have
walked
one
step
on
her
deck
without
treading
on
them
the
father
birds
were
aloft
in
the
rigging
or
swimming
in
the
warm
green
sea
and
they
made
such
a
clamor
when
they
saw
jack
that
they
nearly
woke
the
fairies
nearly
but
not
quite
for
the
little
things
turned
round
in
jack
pockets
and
sneezed
and
began
to
snore
again
then
the
boat
swam
past
a
fine
brig
some
sea
fairies
had
just
flung
her
cargo
overboard
and
were
playing
at
on
deck
these
were
not
at
all
like
jack
own
fairies
they
were
about
the
same
height
and
size
as
himself
and
they
had
brown
faces
and
red
flannel
shirts
and
red
caps
on
a
large
fleet
of
the
pearly
nautilus
was
collected
close
under
the
vessel
lee
the
little
creatures
were
feasting
on
what
the
sea
fairies
had
thrown
overboard
and
jack
boat
in
its
eagerness
to
get
on
went
plunging
through
them
so
roughly
that
several
were
capsized
upon
this
the
brown
sea
fairies
looked
over
and
called
out
angrily
boat
ahoy
and
the
boat
stopped
tell
that
boat
of
yours
to
mind
what
she
is
about
said
the
fairy
to
jack
jack
touched
his
hat
and
said
yes
sir
and
then
called
out
to
his
boat
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
running
down
these
little
live
so
carelessly
go
at
a
more
gentle
pace
so
it
swam
more
slowly
and
jack
being
by
this
time
hungry
curled
himself
up
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
and
fell
asleep
he
dreamt
directly
about
a
fowl
and
some
potatoes
and
he
ate
a
wing
and
then
he
ate
a
and
then
somebody
said
to
him
that
he
had
better
not
eat
any
more
but
he
did
he
ate
another
wing
and
presently
an
came
and
he
ate
some
of
that
and
then
he
ate
some
more
and
then
he
immediately
woke
now
that
bird
told
me
not
to
eat
too
much
said
jack
and
yet
i
have
done
it
i
never
felt
so
full
in
my
life
and
for
more
than
half
an
hour
he
scarcely
noticed
anything
at
last
he
lifted
up
his
head
and
saw
straight
before
him
two
great
brown
cliffs
and
between
them
flowed
in
the
wonderful
river
other
rivers
flow
out
but
this
river
flowed
in
and
took
with
it
far
into
the
land
dolphins
mullet
and
many
other
strange
creatures
and
that
is
one
reason
why
it
was
called
the
magic
river
or
the
wonderful
river
at
first
it
was
rather
wide
and
jack
was
alarmed
to
see
what
multitudes
of
soldiers
stood
on
either
side
to
guard
the
banks
and
prevent
any
person
from
landing
he
wondered
how
he
should
get
the
fairies
on
shore
however
in
about
an
hour
the
river
became
much
narrower
and
then
jack
saw
that
the
guards
were
not
real
soldiers
but
flamingoes
there
they
stood
in
long
regiments
among
the
reeds
and
never
stirred
they
are
the
only
the
fairies
have
in
their
pay
they
are
very
fierce
and
never
allow
anything
but
a
fairy
ship
to
come
up
the
river
they
guarded
the
banks
for
miles
and
miles
many
thousands
of
them
standing
a
little
way
into
the
water
among
the
flags
and
rushes
but
at
last
there
were
no
more
reeds
and
no
soldier
guards
for
the
stream
became
narrower
and
flowed
between
such
steep
rocks
that
no
one
could
possibly
have
climbed
them

jack
looked
at
these
hot
brown
rocks
first
on
the
left
bank
and
then
on
the
right
till
he
was
quite
tired
but
at
last
the
shore
on
the
right
bank
became
flat
and
he
saw
a
beautiful
little
bay
where
the
water
was
still
and
where
grass
grew
down
to
the
brink
he
was
so
much
pleased
at
this
change
that
he
cried
out
hastily
oh
how
i
wish
my
boat
would
swim
into
that
bay
and
let
me
land
he
had
no
sooner
spoken
than
the
boat
altered
her
course
as
if
somebody
had
been
steering
her
and
began
to
make
for
the
bay
as
fast
as
she
could
go
how
odd
thought
jack
i
wonder
whether
i
ought
to
have
spoken
for
the
boat
certainly
did
not
intend
to
come
into
this
bay
however
i
think
i
will
let
her
alone
now
for
i
certainly
do
wish
very
much
to
land
here
as
they
drew
towards
the
strand
the
water
got
so
shallow
that
you
could
see
crabs
and
lobsters
walking
about
at
the
bottom
at
last
the
boat
keel
grated
on
the
pebbles
and
just
as
jack
began
to
think
of
jumping
on
shore
he
saw
two
little
old
women
approaching
and
gently
driving
a
white
horse
before
them
the
horse
had
panniers
one
on
each
side
and
when
his
feet
were
in
the
water
he
stood
still
and
jack
said
to
one
of
the
old
women
will
you
be
so
kind
as
to
tell
me
whether
this
is
fairyland
what
does
he
say
asked
one
old
woman
of
the
other
i
asked
if
this
was
fairyland
repeated
jack
for
he
thought
the
first
old
woman
might
have
been
deaf
she
was
very
handsomely
dressed
in
a
red
satin
gown
and
did
not
look
in
the
least
like
a
though
it
afterwards
appeared
that
she
was
one
he
says
this
fairyland
she
replied
and
the
other
who
had
a
blue
satin
cloak
answered
oh
does
he
and
then
they
began
to
empty
the
panniers
of
many
small
blue
and
pink
and
scarlet
shirts
and
coats
and
stockings
and
when
they
had
made
them
into
two
little
heaps
they
knelt
down
and
began
to
wash
them
in
the
river
taking
no
notice
of
him
whatever
jack
stared
at
them
they
were
not
much
taller
than
himself
and
they
were
not
taking
the
slightest
care
of
their
handsome
clothes
then
he
looked
at
the
old
white
horse
who
was
hanging
his
head
over
the
lovely
clear
water
with
a
very
discontented
air
at
last
the
blue
said
i
shall
leave
off
now
i
got
a
pain
in
my
works
do
said
the
other
we
go
home
and
have
a
cup
of
tea
then
she
glanced
at
jack
who
was
still
sitting
in
the
boat
and
said
can
you
strike
i
can
if
i
choose
replied
jack
a
little
astonished
at
this
speech
and
the
red
and
blue
wrung
out
the
clothes
put
them
again
into
the
panniers
and
taking
the
old
horse
by
the
bridle
began
gently
to
lead
him
away
i
have
a
great
mind
to
land
thought
jack
i
should
not
wonder
at
all
if
this
is
fairyland
so
as
the
boat
came
here
to
please
me
i
shall
ask
it
to
stay
where
it
is
in
case
i
should
want
it
again
so
he
sprang
ashore
and
said
to
the
boat
stay
just
where
you
are
will
you
and
he
ran
after
the
old
women
calling
to
them
is
there
any
law
to
prevent
my
coming
into
your
country
wo
cried
the
old
woman
and
the
horse
stopped
while
the
woman
repeated
any
law
no
not
that
i
know
of
but
if
you
are
a
stranger
here
you
had
better
look
out
why
asked
jack
you
do
suppose
do
you
she
answered
that
our
queen
will
wind
up
strangers
while
jack
was
wondering
what
she
meant
the
other
said
i
should
wonder
if
he
goes
eight
days
gee
and
the
horse
went
on
no
wo
said
the
other
no
no
gee
i
tell
you
cried
the
first
upon
this
to
jack
intense
astonishment
the
old
horse
stopped
and
said
speaking
through
his
nose
now
then
which
is
it
to
be
i
willing
to
gee
and
i
agreeable
to
wo
but
what
a
fellow
to
do
when
you
say
them
both
together
why
he
talks
exclaimed
jack
it
because
he
got
a
cold
in
his
head
observed
one
of
the
he
always
talks
when
he
got
a
cold
and
there
no
pleasing
him
whatever
you
say
he
not
satisfied
gee
boney
do
gee
it
is
then
said
the
horse
and
began
to
jog
on
he
spoke
again
said
jack
upon
which
the
horse
laughed
and
jack
was
quite
alarmed
it
appears
that
your
horses
do
talk
observed
the
woman
never
answered
jack
they
ca
you
mean
they
wo
observed
the
old
horse
and
though
he
spoke
the
words
of
mankind
it
was
not
in
a
voice
like
theirs
still
jack
felt
that
his
was
just
the
natural
tone
for
a
horse
and
that
it
did
not
arise
only
from
the
length
of
his
nose
you
find
out
some
day
perhaps
he
continued
whether
horses
can
talk
or
not
shall
i
said
jack
very
earnestly
they
tell
proceeded
the
white
horse
i
would
be
you
when
they
tell
how
you
used
them
have
you
been
ill
used
said
jack
in
an
anxious
tone
yes
yes
of
course
he
has
one
of
the
women
broke
in
but
he
has
come
here
to
get
all
right
again
this
is
a
very
wholesome
country
for
horses
is
it
boney
yes
said
the
horse
well
then
jog
on
there
a
dear
continued
the
old
woman
why
you
will
be
young
again
soon
you
know
young
and
gamesome
and
handsome
you
be
quite
a
colt
by
and
by
and
then
we
shall
set
you
free
to
join
your
companions
in
the
happy
meadows
the
old
horse
was
so
comforted
by
this
kind
speech
that
he
pricked
up
his
ears
and
quickened
his
pace
considerably
he
was
shamefully
used
observed
one
look
at
him
how
lean
he
is
you
can
see
all
his
ribs
yes
said
the
other
as
if
apologizing
for
the
poor
old
horse
he
gets
when
he
thinks
of
all
he
has
gone
through
but
he
is
a
vast
deal
better
already
than
he
was
he
used
to
live
in
london
his
master
always
carried
a
long
whip
to
beat
him
with
and
never
spoke
civilly
to
him
london
exclaimed
jack
why
that
is
in
my
country
how
did
the
horse
get
here
that
no
business
of
yours
answered
one
of
the
women
but
i
can
tell
you
he
came
because
he
was
wanted
which
is
more
than
you
are
you
let
him
alone
said
the
horse
in
a
querulous
tone
i
bear
any
malice
no
he
has
a
good
disposition
has
boney
observed
the
red
old
woman
pray
are
you
a
boy
yes
said
jack
a
real
boy
that
wants
no
winding
up
inquired
the
old
woman
i
do
know
what
you
mean
answered
jack
but
i
am
a
real
boy
certainly
ah
she
replied
well
i
thought
you
were
by
the
way
boney
spoke
to
you
how
frightened
you
must
be
i
wonder
what
will
be
done
to
all
your
people
for
driving
and
working
and
beating
so
many
beautiful
creatures
to
death
every
year
that
comes
they
have
to
pay
for
it
some
day
you
may
depend
jack
was
a
little
alarmed
and
answered
that
he
had
never
been
unkind
himself
to
horses
and
he
was
glad
that
boney
bore
no
malice
they
worked
him
and
often
drove
him
about
all
night
in
the
miserable
streets
and
never
let
him
have
so
much
as
a
canter
in
a
green
field
said
one
of
the
women
but
he
be
all
right
now
only
he
has
to
begin
at
the
wrong
end
what
do
you
mean
said
jack
why
in
this
country
answered
the
old
woman
they
begin
by
being
terribly
old
and
stiff
and
they
seem
miserable
and
jaded
at
first
but
by
degrees
they
get
young
again
as
you
heard
me
reminding
him
indeed
said
jack
and
do
you
like
that
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
me
she
answered
we
are
only
here
to
take
care
of
all
the
creatures
that
men
have
ill
used
while
they
are
sick
and
old
which
they
are
when
first
they
come
to
us
after
they
are
dead
you
know
we
take
care
of
them
and
gradually
bring
them
up
to
be
young
and
happy
again
this
must
be
a
very
nice
country
to
live
in
then
said
jack
for
horses
it
is
said
the
old
lady
significantly
well
said
jack
it
does
seem
very
full
of
haystacks
certainly
and
all
the
air
smells
of
fresh
grass
at
this
moment
they
came
to
a
beautiful
meadow
and
the
old
horse
stopped
and
turning
to
the
woman
said
faxa
i
think
i
could
fancy
a
handful
of
clover
upon
this
faxa
snatched
jack
cap
off
his
head
and
in
a
very
active
manner
jumped
over
a
little
ditch
and
gathering
some
clover
presently
brought
it
back
full
handing
it
to
the
old
horse
with
great
civility
you
should
be
in
such
a
hurry
observed
the
old
horse
your
weights
will
be
running
down
some
day
if
you
do
mind
it
all
zeal
observed
the
woman
just
then
a
little
man
dressed
like
a
groom
came
running
up
out
of
breath
oh
here
you
are
dow
he
exclaimed
to
the
woman
come
along
will
you
lady
betty
wants
you
it
such
a
hot
day
and
nobody
she
says
can
fan
her
so
well
as
you
can
the
woman
without
a
word
went
off
with
the
groom
and
jack
thought
he
would
go
with
them
for
this
lady
betty
could
surely
tell
him
whether
the
country
was
called
fairyland
or
whether
he
must
get
into
his
boat
and
go
farther
he
did
not
like
either
to
hear
the
way
in
which
faxa
and
dow
talked
about
their
works
and
their
weights
so
he
asked
faxa
to
give
him
his
cap
which
she
did
and
he
heard
a
curious
sort
of
little
ticking
noise
as
he
came
close
to
her
which
startled
him
oh
this
must
be
fairyland
i
am
sure
thought
jack
for
in
my
country
our
pulses
beat
quite
differently
from
that
well
said
faxa
rather
sharply
do
you
find
any
fault
with
the
way
i
go
no
said
jack
a
little
ashamed
of
having
listened
i
think
you
walk
beautifully
your
steps
are
so
regular
she
observed
the
old
horse
in
a
melancholy
voice
and
with
a
deep
sigh
in
the
largest
you
hardly
find
the
least
fault
with
her
chain
she
not
like
the
goods
they
turn
out
in
clerkenwell
jack
was
more
and
more
startled
and
so
glad
to
get
his
cap
and
run
after
the
groom
and
dow
to
find
lady
betty
that
he
might
be
with
ordinary
human
beings
again
but
when
he
got
up
to
them
he
found
that
lady
betty
was
a
beautiful
brown
mare
she
was
lying
in
a
languid
and
rather
affected
attitude
with
a
load
of
fresh
hay
before
her
and
two
attendants
one
of
whom
stood
holding
a
parasol
over
her
head
and
the
other
was
fanning
her
i
so
glad
you
are
come
my
good
dow
said
the
brown
mare
you
think
i
am
strong
enough
to
set
off
for
the
happy
meadows
well
said
dow
i
afraid
not
yet
you
must
remember
that
it
is
of
no
use
your
leaving
us
till
you
have
quite
got
over
the
effects
of
the
fall
just
then
lady
betty
observed
jack
and
said
take
that
boy
away
he
reminds
me
of
a
jockey
the
attentive
groom
instantly
started
forward
but
jack
was
too
nimble
for
him
he
ran
and
ran
with
all
his
might
and
only
wished
he
had
never
left
the
boat
but
still
he
heard
the
groom
behind
him
and
in
fact
the
groom
caught
him
at
last
and
held
him
so
fast
that
struggling
was
of
no
use
at
all
you
young
rascal
he
exclaimed
as
he
recovered
breath
how
you
do
run
it
enough
to
break
your
mainspring
what
harm
did
i
do
asked
jack
i
was
only
looking
at
the
mare
harm
exclaimed
the
groom
harm
indeed
why
you
reminded
her
of
a
jockey
it
enough
to
hold
her
back
poor
thing
and
we
trying
so
hard
too
to
make
her
forget
what
a
cruel
end
she
came
to
in
the
old
world
you
need
not
hold
me
so
tightly
said
jack
i
shall
not
run
away
again
but
he
added
if
this
is
fairyland
it
is
not
half
such
a
nice
country
as
i
expected
fairyland
exclaimed
the
groom
stepping
back
with
surprise
why
what
made
you
think
of
such
a
thing
this
is
only
one
of
the
border
countries
where
things
are
set
right
again
that
people
have
caused
to
go
wrong
in
the
world
the
world
you
know
is
what
men
and
women
call
their
own
home
i
know
said
jack
and
that
where
i
came
from
then
as
the
groom
seemed
no
longer
to
be
angry
he
went
on
and
i
wish
you
would
tell
me
about
lady
betty
she
was
a
beautiful
fleet
creature
of
the
racehorse
breed
said
the
groom
and
she
won
silver
cups
for
her
master
and
then
they
made
her
run
a
which
frightened
her
but
still
she
won
it
and
then
they
made
her
run
another
and
she
cleared
some
terribly
high
hurdles
and
many
gates
and
ditches
till
she
came
to
an
awful
one
and
at
first
she
would
not
take
it
but
her
rider
spurred
and
beat
her
till
she
tried
it
was
beyond
her
powers
and
she
fell
and
broke
both
her
forelegs
then
they
shot
her
after
she
had
died
that
miserable
death
we
had
her
here
to
make
her
all
right
again
is
this
the
only
country
where
you
set
things
right
asked
jack
certainly
not
answered
the
groom
they
lie
about
in
all
directions
why
you
might
wander
for
years
and
never
come
to
the
end
of
this
one
i
am
afraid
i
shall
not
find
the
one
i
am
looking
for
said
jack
if
your
countries
are
so
large
i
do
think
our
world
is
much
larger
than
yours
answered
the
groom
but
come
along
i
hear
the
bell
and
we
are
a
good
way
from
the
palace
jack
in
fact
heard
the
violent
ringing
of
a
bell
at
some
distance
and
when
the
groom
began
to
run
he
ran
beside
him
for
he
thought
he
should
like
to
see
the
palace
as
they
ran
people
gathered
from
all
sides
fields
cottages
mills
till
at
last
there
was
a
little
crowd
among
whom
jack
saw
dow
and
faxa
and
they
were
all
making
for
a
large
house
the
wide
door
of
which
was
standing
open
jack
stood
with
the
crowd
and
peeped
in
there
was
a
woman
sitting
inside
upon
a
a
tall
large
woman
with
a
gown
on
and
beside
her
stood
a
table
covered
with
things
that
looked
like
keys
what
is
that
woman
doing
said
he
to
faxa
who
was
standing
close
to
him
winding
us
up
to
be
sure
answered
faxa
you
do
suppose
surely
that
we
can
go
forever
extraordinary
said
jack
then
are
you
wound
up
every
evening
like
watches
unless
we
have
misbehaved
ourselves
she
answered
and
then
she
lets
us
run
down
and
what
then
what
then
repeated
faxa
why
then
we
have
to
stop
and
stand
against
a
wall
till
she
is
pleased
to
forgive
us
and
let
our
friends
carry
us
in
to
be
set
going
again
jack
looked
in
and
saw
the
people
pass
in
and
stand
close
by
the
woman
one
after
the
other
she
took
by
the
chin
with
her
left
hand
and
with
her
right
hand
found
a
key
that
pleased
her
it
seemed
to
jack
that
there
was
a
tiny
in
the
back
of
their
heads
and
that
she
put
the
key
in
and
wound
them
up
you
must
take
your
turn
with
the
others
said
the
groom
there
no
in
my
head
said
jack
besides
i
do
not
want
any
woman
to
wind
me
up
but
you
must
do
as
others
do
he
persisted
and
if
you
have
no
our
queen
can
easily
have
one
made
i
should
think
make
one
in
my
head
exclaimed
jack
she
shall
do
no
such
thing
we
shall
see
said
faxa
quietly
and
jack
was
so
frightened
that
he
set
off
and
ran
back
towards
the
river
with
all
his
might
many
of
the
people
called
to
him
to
stop
but
they
could
not
run
after
him
because
they
wanted
winding
up
however
they
would
certainly
have
caught
him
if
he
had
not
been
very
quick
for
before
he
got
to
the
river
he
heard
behind
him
the
footsteps
of
those
who
had
been
first
attended
to
by
the
queen
and
he
had
only
just
time
to
spring
into
the
boat
when
they
reached
the
edge
of
the
water
no
sooner
was
he
on
board
than
the
boat
swung
round
and
got
out
again
into
the
middle
of
the
stream
but
he
could
not
feel
safe
till
not
only
was
there
a
long
reach
of
water
between
him
and
the
shore
but
till
he
had
gone
so
far
down
the
river
that
the
beautiful
bay
had
passed
out
of
sight
and
the
sun
was
going
down
by
this
time
he
began
to
feel
very
tired
and
sleepy
so
having
looked
at
his
fairies
and
found
that
they
were
all
safe
and
fast
asleep
he
laid
down
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
and
fell
into
a
doze
and
then
into
a
dream
chapter
iv
bees
and
other
the
dove
laid
some
little
sticks
then
began
to
coo
the
gnat
took
his
trumpet
up
to
play
the
day
through
the
pie
chattered
soft
and
long
but
that
she
always
does
the
bee
did
all
he
had
to
do
and
only
said
buzz
when
jack
at
length
opened
his
eyes
he
found
that
it
was
night
for
the
full
moon
was
shining
but
it
was
not
at
all
a
dark
night
for
he
could
see
distinctly
some
black
birds
that
looked
like
ravens
they
were
sitting
in
a
row
on
the
edge
of
the
boat
now
that
he
had
fairies
in
his
pockets
he
could
understand
and
he
heard
one
of
these
ravens
saying
there
is
no
meat
so
tender
i
wish
i
could
pick
their
little
eyes
out
yes
said
another
fairies
are
delicate
eating
indeed
we
must
speak
jack
fair
if
we
want
to
get
at
them
and
she
heaved
up
a
deep
sigh
jack
lay
still
and
thought
he
had
better
pretend
to
be
asleep
but
they
soon
noticed
that
his
eyes
were
open
and
one
of
them
presently
walked
up
his
leg
and
bowed
and
asked
if
he
was
hungry
jack
said
no
no
more
am
i
replied
the
raven
not
at
all
hungry
then
she
hopped
off
his
leg
and
jack
sat
up
and
how
are
the
sweet
fairies
that
my
young
master
is
taking
to
their
home
asked
another
of
the
ravens
i
hope
they
are
safe
in
my
young
master
pockets
jack
felt
in
his
pockets
yes
they
were
all
safe
but
he
did
not
take
any
of
them
out
lest
the
ravens
should
snatch
at
them
eh
continued
the
raven
pretending
to
listen
did
this
dear
young
gentleman
say
that
the
fairies
were
asleep
it
does
amuse
me
to
talk
about
fairies
said
jack
but
if
you
would
explain
some
of
the
things
in
this
country
that
i
can
not
make
out
i
should
be
very
glad
what
things
asked
the
blackest
of
the
ravens
why
said
jack
i
see
a
full
moon
lying
down
there
among
the
and
just
going
to
set
and
there
is
a
overhead
plunging
among
those
great
gray
clouds
and
just
this
moment
i
saw
a
thin
crescent
moon
peeping
out
between
the
branches
of
that
tree
well
said
all
the
ravens
at
once
did
the
young
master
never
see
a
crescent
moon
in
the
men
and
women
world
oh
yes
said
jack
did
he
never
see
a
full
moon
asked
the
ravens
yes
of
course
said
jack
but
they
are
the
same
moon
i
could
never
see
all
three
of
them
at
the
same
time
the
ravens
were
very
much
surprised
at
this
and
one
of
them
said
if
my
young
master
did
not
see
the
moons
it
must
have
been
because
he
did
look
perhaps
my
young
master
slept
in
a
room
and
had
only
one
window
if
so
he
could
see
all
the
sky
at
once
i
tell
you
raven
said
jack
laughing
that
i
know
there
is
never
more
than
one
moon
in
my
country
and
sometimes
there
is
no
moon
at
all
upon
this
all
the
ravens
hung
down
their
heads
and
looked
very
much
ashamed
for
there
is
nothing
that
birds
hate
so
much
as
to
be
laughed
at
and
they
believed
that
jack
was
saying
this
to
mock
them
and
that
he
knew
what
they
had
come
for
so
first
one
and
then
another
hopped
to
the
other
end
of
the
boat
and
flew
away
till
at
last
there
was
only
one
left
and
she
appeared
to
be
out
of
spirits
and
did
not
speak
again
till
he
spoke
to
her
raven
said
jack
there
something
very
cold
and
slippery
lying
at
the
bottom
of
the
boat
i
touched
it
just
now
and
i
do
like
it
at
all
it
a
said
the
raven
and
she
stooped
and
picked
up
a
long
thing
with
her
beak
which
she
threw
out
and
then
looked
over
the
water
swarms
with
them
wicked
murderous
creatures
they
smell
the
young
fairies
and
they
want
to
eat
them
jack
was
so
thrown
off
his
guard
that
he
snatched
one
fairy
out
just
to
make
sure
that
it
was
safe
it
was
the
one
with
the
mustache
and
alas
in
one
instant
the
raven
flew
at
it
got
it
out
of
his
hand
and
pecked
off
its
head
before
it
had
time
to
wake
or
jack
to
rescue
it
then
as
she
slowly
rose
she
croaked
and
said
to
jack
you
catch
it
for
this
my
young
master
and
she
flew
to
the
bough
of
a
tree
where
she
finished
eating
the
fairy
and
threw
his
little
empty
coat
into
the
river
on
this
jack
began
to
cry
bitterly
and
to
think
what
a
foolish
boy
he
had
been
he
was
the
more
sorry
because
he
did
not
even
know
that
poor
little
fellow
name
but
he
had
heard
the
others
calling
by
name
to
their
companions
and
very
grand
names
they
were
too
one
was
jovinian
he
was
a
very
gentleman
the
other
two
were
roxaletta
and
mopsa
presently
however
jack
forgot
to
be
unhappy
for
two
of
the
moons
went
down
and
then
the
sun
rose
and
he
was
delighted
to
find
that
however
many
moons
there
might
be
there
was
only
one
sun
even
in
the
country
of
the
wonderful
river
so
on
and
on
they
went
but
the
river
was
very
wide
and
the
waves
were
boisterous
on
the
right
brink
was
a
thick
forest
of
trees
with
such
heavy
foliage
that
a
little
way
off
they
looked
like
a
bank
green
and
smooth
and
steep
but
as
the
light
became
clearer
jack
could
see
here
and
there
the
great
stems
and
see
creatures
like
foxes
wild
boars
and
deer
come
stealing
down
to
drink
in
the
river
it
was
very
hot
here
not
at
all
like
the
spring
weather
he
had
left
behind
and
as
the
low
sunbeams
shone
into
jack
face
he
said
hastily
without
thinking
of
what
would
occur
i
wish
i
might
land
among
those
lovely
glades
on
the
left
bank
no
sooner
said
than
the
boat
began
to
make
for
the
left
bank
and
the
nearer
they
got
towards
it
the
more
beautiful
it
became
but
also
the
more
stormy
were
the
reaches
of
water
they
had
to
traverse
a
lovely
country
indeed
it
sloped
gently
down
to
the
water
edge
and
beautiful
trees
were
scattered
over
it
soft
mossy
grass
grew
everywhere
great
old
laburnum
trees
stretched
their
boughs
down
in
patches
over
the
water
and
higher
up
camellias
almost
as
large
as
hawthorns
grew
together
and
mingled
their
red
and
white
flowers
the
country
was
not
so
open
as
a
park
it
was
more
like
a
woodland
but
there
was
a
wide
space
just
where
the
boat
was
steering
for
that
had
no
trees
only
a
few
flowering
shrubs
here
groups
of
people
were
bustling
about
and
there
were
shrill
fifes
sounding
and
drums
farther
back
he
saw
rows
of
booths
or
tents
under
the
shade
of
the
trees
in
another
place
some
people
dressed
like
gypsies
had
made
fires
of
sticks
just
at
the
skirts
of
the
woodland
and
were
boiling
their
pots
some
of
these
had
very
gaudy
tilted
carts
hung
all
over
with
goods
such
as
baskets
brushes
mats
little
glasses
pottery
and
beads
it
seemed
to
be
a
kind
of
fair
to
which
people
had
gathered
from
all
parts
but
there
was
not
one
house
to
be
seen
all
the
goods
were
either
hung
upon
trees
or
collected
in
tents
the
people
were
not
all
of
the
same
race
indeed
he
thought
the
only
human
beings
were
the
gypsies
for
the
folks
who
had
tents
were
no
taller
than
himself
how
hot
it
was
that
morning
and
as
the
boat
pushed
itself
into
a
little
creek
and
made
its
way
among
the
beds
of
yellow
and
purple
iris
which
skirted
the
brink
what
a
crowd
of
and
large
butterflies
rose
from
them
stay
where
you
are
cried
jack
to
the
boat
and
at
that
instant
such
a
splendid
moth
rose
slowly
that
he
sprang
on
shore
after
it
and
quite
forgot
the
fair
and
the
people
in
his
desire
to
follow
it
the
moth
settled
on
a
great
red
and
he
stole
up
to
look
at
it
as
large
as
a
swallow
it
floated
on
before
him
its
wings
were
nearly
black
and
they
had
spots
of
gold
on
them
when
it
rose
again
jack
ran
after
it
till
he
found
himself
close
to
the
rows
of
tents
where
the
brown
people
stood
and
they
began
to
cry
out
to
him
what
you
buy
what
you
buy
sir
and
they
crowded
about
him
so
that
he
soon
lost
sight
of
the
moth
and
forgot
everything
else
in
his
surprise
at
the
booths
they
were
full
of
splendid
things
clocks
and
musical
boxes
strange
china
ornaments
embroidered
slippers
red
caps
and
many
kinds
of
splendid
silks
and
small
carpets
in
other
booths
were
swords
and
dirks
glittering
with
jewels
and
the
chatter
of
the
people
when
they
talked
together
was
not
in
a
language
that
jack
could
understand
some
of
the
booths
were
square
and
evidently
made
of
common
canvas
for
when
you
went
into
them
and
the
sun
shone
you
could
distinctly
see
the
threads
but
scattered
a
little
farther
on
in
groups
were
some
round
tents
which
were
far
more
curious
they
were
open
on
all
sides
and
consisted
only
of
a
thick
canopy
overhead
which
was
supported
by
one
beautiful
round
pillar
in
the
middle
outside
the
canopy
was
white
or
brownish
but
when
jack
stood
under
these
tents
he
saw
that
they
were
lined
with
splendid
flutings
of
brown
or
pink
silk
what
looked
like
silk
at
least
for
it
was
impossible
to
be
sure
whether
these
were
real
tents
or
gigantic
mushrooms
they
varied
in
size
also
as
mushrooms
do
and
in
shape
some
were
large
enough
for
twenty
people
to
stand
under
them
and
had
flat
tops
with
a
brown
lining
others
had
roofs
these
were
lined
with
pink
and
would
only
shelter
six
or
seven
the
people
who
sold
in
these
tents
were
as
strange
as
their
neighbors
each
had
a
little
high
cap
on
his
head
in
shape
just
like
a
beehive
and
it
was
made
of
straw
and
had
a
little
hole
in
front
in
fact
jack
very
soon
saw
bees
flying
in
and
out
and
it
was
evident
that
these
people
had
their
honey
made
on
the
premises
they
were
chiefly
selling
country
produce
they
had
cheeses
so
large
as
to
reach
to
their
waists
and
the
women
trundled
them
along
as
boys
do
their
hoops
they
sold
a
great
many
kinds
of
seed
too
in
wooden
bowls
and
cakes
and
good
things
to
eat
such
as
gilt
gingerbread
jack
bought
some
of
this
and
found
it
very
nice
indeed
but
when
he
took
out
his
money
to
pay
for
it
the
little
man
looked
rather
strangely
at
it
and
turned
it
over
with
an
air
of
disgust
then
jack
saw
him
hand
it
to
his
wife
who
also
seemed
to
dislike
it
and
presently
jack
observed
that
they
followed
him
about
first
on
one
side
then
on
the
other
at
last
the
little
woman
slipped
her
hand
into
his
pocket
and
jack
putting
his
hand
in
directly
found
his
sixpence
had
been
returned
why
you
given
me
back
my
money
he
said
the
little
woman
put
her
hands
behind
her
i
do
not
like
it
she
said
it
dirty
at
least
it
not
new
no
it
not
new
said
jack
a
good
deal
surprised
but
it
is
a
good
sixpence
the
bees
do
like
it
continued
the
little
woman
they
like
things
to
be
neat
and
new
and
that
sixpence
is
bent
what
shall
i
give
you
then
said
jack
the
good
little
woman
laughed
and
blushed
this
young
gentleman
has
a
beautiful
whistle
round
his
neck
she
observed
politely
but
did
not
ask
for
it
jack
had
a
so
he
took
it
off
and
gave
it
to
her
thank
you
for
the
bees
she
said
they
love
to
be
called
home
when
we
collected
flowers
for
them
so
she
made
a
pretty
little
courtesy
and
went
away
to
her
customers
there
were
some
very
strange
creatures
also
about
the
same
height
as
jack
who
had
no
tents
and
seemed
there
to
buy
not
to
sell
yet
they
looked
poorer
than
the
other
folks
and
they
were
also
very
cross
and
discontented
nothing
pleased
them
their
clothes
were
made
of
moss
and
their
mantles
of
feathers
and
they
talked
in
a
queer
whistling
tone
of
voice
and
carried
their
skinny
little
children
on
their
backs
and
on
their
shoulders
they
were
treated
with
great
respect
by
the
people
in
the
tents
and
when
jack
asked
his
friend
to
whom
he
had
given
the
whistle
what
they
were
and
where
they
got
so
much
money
as
they
had
she
replied
that
they
lived
over
the
hills
and
were
afraid
to
come
in
their
best
clothes
they
were
rich
and
powerful
at
home
and
they
came
shabbily
dressed
and
behaved
humbly
lest
their
enemies
should
envy
them
it
was
very
dangerous
she
said
to
fairies
to
be
envied
jack
wanted
to
listen
to
their
strange
whistling
talk
but
he
could
not
for
the
noise
and
cheerful
chattering
of
the
brown
folks
and
more
still
for
the
screaming
and
talking
of
parrots
among
the
goods
were
hundreds
of
splendid
gilt
cages
which
were
hung
by
long
gold
chains
from
the
trees
each
cage
contained
a
parrot
and
his
mate
and
they
all
seemed
to
be
very
unhappy
indeed
the
parrots
could
talk
and
they
kept
screaming
to
the
discontented
women
to
buy
things
for
them
and
trying
very
hard
to
attract
attention
one
old
parrot
made
himself
quite
conspicuous
by
these
efforts
he
flung
himself
against
the
wires
of
his
cage
he
squalled
he
screamed
he
knocked
the
floor
with
his
beak
till
jack
and
one
of
the
customers
came
running
up
to
see
what
was
the
matter
what
do
you
make
such
a
fuss
for
cried
the
discontented
woman
you
set
your
cage
swinging
with
knocking
yourself
about
and
what
good
does
that
do
i
can
not
break
the
spell
and
open
it
for
you
i
know
that
answered
the
parrot
sobbing
but
it
hurts
my
feelings
so
that
you
should
take
no
notice
of
me
now
that
i
have
come
down
in
the
world
yes
said
the
parrot
mate
it
hurts
our
feelings
i
have
forgotten
you
answered
the
woman
more
crossly
than
ever
i
was
buying
a
measure
of
maize
for
you
when
you
began
to
make
such
a
noise
jack
thought
this
was
the
queerest
conversation
he
had
ever
heard
in
his
life
and
he
was
still
more
surprised
when
the
bird
answered
i
would
much
rather
you
would
buy
me
a
here
we
are
shut
up
without
a
chance
of
getting
out
and
with
nobody
to
pity
us
and
we
ca
even
have
the
comfort
of
crying
because
we
got
nothing
to
wipe
our
eyes
with
but
at
least
replied
the
woman
you
can
cry
now
if
you
please
and
when
you
had
your
other
face
you
could
not
buy
me
a
handkerchief
sobbed
the
parrot
i
ca
afford
both
whined
the
cross
woman
and
i
paid
now
for
the
maize
so
saying
she
went
back
to
the
tent
to
fetch
her
present
to
the
parrots
and
as
their
cage
was
still
swinging
jack
put
out
his
hand
to
steady
it
for
them
and
the
instant
he
did
so
they
became
perfectly
silent
and
all
the
other
parrots
on
that
tree
who
had
been
flinging
themselves
about
in
their
cages
left
off
screaming
and
became
silent
too
the
old
parrot
looked
very
cunning
his
cage
hung
by
such
a
long
gold
chain
that
it
was
just
on
a
level
with
jack
face
and
so
many
odd
things
had
happened
that
day
that
it
did
not
seem
more
odd
than
usual
to
hear
him
say
in
a
tone
of
great
astonishment
it
a
boy
if
ever
there
was
one
yes
said
jack
i
a
boy
you
wo
go
yet
will
you
said
the
parrot
no
do
said
a
great
many
other
parrots
jack
agreed
to
stay
a
little
while
upon
which
they
all
thanked
him
i
had
no
notion
you
were
a
boy
till
you
touched
my
cage
said
the
old
parrot
jack
did
not
know
how
this
could
have
told
him
so
he
only
answered
indeed
i
a
fairy
observed
the
parrot
in
a
confidential
tone
we
are
imprisoned
here
by
our
enemies
the
gypsies
so
we
are
answered
a
chorus
of
other
parrots
i
sorry
for
that
replied
jack
i
friends
with
the
fairies
do
tell
said
the
parrot
drawing
a
film
over
his
eyes
and
pretending
to
be
asleep
at
that
moment
his
friend
in
the
moss
petticoat
and
feather
cloak
came
up
with
a
little
measure
of
maize
and
poured
it
into
the
cage
here
neighbor
she
said
i
must
say
now
for
the
gypsy
is
coming
this
way
and
i
want
to
buy
some
of
her
goods
well
thank
you
answered
the
parrot
sobbing
again
but
i
could
have
wished
it
had
been
a
i
lend
you
my
handkerchief
said
jack
here
and
he
drew
it
out
and
pushed
it
between
the
wires
the
parrot
and
his
wife
were
in
a
great
hurry
to
get
handkerchief
they
pulled
it
in
very
hastily
but
instead
of
using
it
they
rolled
it
up
into
a
ball
and
the
tucked
it
under
her
wing
it
makes
me
tremble
all
over
said
she
to
think
of
such
good
luck
i
say
observed
the
parrot
to
jack
i
know
all
about
it
now
got
some
of
my
people
in
your
pockets
not
of
my
own
tribe
but
fairies
by
this
jack
was
sure
that
the
parrot
really
was
a
fairy
himself
and
he
listened
to
what
he
had
to
say
the
more
attentively
chapter
the
parrot
in
his
shawl
that
handkerchief
did
an
egyptian
to
my
mother
give
she
was
a
charmer
and
could
almost
read
the
thoughts
of
that
gypsy
woman
who
is
coming
with
her
cart
said
the
parrot
is
a
fairy
too
and
very
malicious
it
was
she
and
others
of
her
tribe
who
caught
us
and
put
us
into
these
cages
for
they
are
more
powerful
than
we
mind
you
do
not
let
her
allure
you
into
the
woods
nor
wheedle
you
or
frighten
you
into
giving
her
any
of
those
fairies
no
said
jack
i
will
not
she
sold
us
to
the
brown
people
continued
the
parrot
mind
you
do
not
buy
anything
of
her
for
your
money
in
her
palm
would
act
as
a
charm
against
you
she
has
a
baby
observed
the
scornfully
yes
a
baby
repeated
the
old
parrot
and
i
hope
by
means
of
that
baby
to
get
her
driven
away
and
perhaps
get
free
myself
i
shall
try
to
put
her
in
a
passion
here
she
comes
there
she
was
indeed
almost
close
at
hand
she
had
a
little
cart
her
goods
were
hung
all
about
it
and
a
small
horse
drew
it
slowly
on
and
stopped
when
she
got
a
customer
several
gypsy
children
were
with
her
and
as
the
people
came
running
together
over
the
grass
to
see
her
goods
she
sang
a
curious
kind
of
song
which
made
them
wish
to
buy
them
jack
turned
from
the
parrot
cage
as
she
came
up
he
had
heard
her
singing
a
little
way
off
and
now
before
she
began
again
he
felt
that
already
her
searching
eyes
had
found
him
out
and
taken
notice
that
he
was
different
from
the
other
people
when
she
began
to
sing
her
selling
song
he
felt
a
most
curious
sensation
he
felt
as
if
there
were
some
cobwebs
before
his
face
and
he
put
up
his
hand
as
if
to
clear
them
away
there
were
no
real
cobwebs
of
course
and
yet
he
again
felt
as
if
they
floated
from
the
gypsy
woman
to
him
like
gossamer
threads
and
attracted
him
towards
her
so
he
gazed
at
her
and
she
at
him
till
jack
began
to
forget
how
the
parrot
had
warned
him
he
saw
her
baby
too
wondered
whether
it
was
heavy
for
her
to
carry
and
wished
he
could
help
her
i
mean
he
saw
that
she
had
a
baby
on
her
arm
it
was
wrapped
in
a
shawl
and
had
a
handkerchief
over
its
face
she
seemed
very
fond
of
it
for
she
kept
hushing
it
and
jack
softly
moved
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
cart
till
the
gypsy
woman
smiled
and
suddenly
began
to
sing
my
good
man
he
an
old
old
man
and
my
good
man
got
a
fall
to
buy
me
a
bargain
so
fast
he
ran
when
he
heard
the
gypsies
call
buy
buy
brushes
baskets
wrought
o
rushes
buy
them
buy
them
take
them
try
them
buy
dames
all
my
old
man
he
has
money
and
land
and
a
young
young
wife
am
i
let
him
put
the
penny
in
my
white
hand
when
he
hears
the
gypsies
cry
buy
buy
laces
veils
to
screen
your
faces
buy
them
buy
them
take
and
try
them
buy
maids
buy
when
the
gypsy
had
finished
her
song
jack
felt
as
if
he
was
covered
all
over
with
cobwebs
but
he
could
not
move
away
and
he
did
not
mind
them
now
all
his
wish
was
to
please
her
and
get
close
to
her
so
when
she
said
in
a
soft
wheedling
voice
what
will
you
please
to
buy
my
pretty
gentleman
he
was
just
going
to
answer
that
he
would
buy
anything
she
recommended
when
to
his
astonishment
and
displeasure
for
he
thought
it
very
rude
the
parrot
suddenly
burst
into
a
violent
fit
of
coughing
which
made
all
the
customers
stare
that
to
clear
my
throat
he
said
in
a
most
impertinent
tone
of
voice
and
then
he
began
to
beat
time
with
his
foot
and
sing
or
rather
scream
out
an
extremely
saucy
imitation
of
the
gypsy
song
and
all
his
parrot
friends
in
the
other
cages
joined
in
the
chorus
my
fair
lady
a
dear
dear
lady
i
walked
by
her
side
to
woo
in
a
garden
alley
so
sweet
and
shady
she
answered
i
love
not
you
john
john
brady
quoth
my
dear
lady
pray
now
pray
now
go
your
way
now
do
john
do
at
first
the
gypsy
did
not
seem
to
know
where
that
mocking
song
came
from
but
when
she
discovered
that
it
was
her
prisoner
the
old
parrot
who
was
thus
daring
to
imitate
her
she
stood
silent
and
glared
at
him
and
her
face
was
almost
white
with
rage
when
he
came
to
the
end
of
the
verse
he
pretended
to
burst
into
a
violent
fit
of
sobbing
and
crying
and
screeched
out
to
his
wife
mate
mate
hand
up
my
handkerchief
oh
oh
it
so
affecting
this
song
is
upon
this
the
other
parrot
pulled
jack
handkerchief
from
under
her
wing
hobbled
up
and
began
with
a
great
show
of
zeal
to
wipe
his
horny
beak
with
it
but
this
was
too
much
for
the
gypsy
she
took
a
large
brush
from
her
cart
and
flung
it
at
the
cage
with
all
her
might
this
set
it
violently
swinging
backwards
and
forwards
but
did
not
stop
the
parrot
who
screeched
out
how
delightful
it
is
to
be
swung
and
then
he
began
to
sing
another
verse
in
the
most
impudent
tone
possible
and
with
a
voice
that
seemed
to
ring
through
head
and
almost
pierce
it
yet
my
fair
lady
my
own
own
lady
for
i
passed
another
day
while
making
her
moan
she
sat
all
alone
and
thus
and
thus
did
she
say
john
john
brady
quoth
my
dear
lady
do
now
do
now
once
more
woo
now
pray
john
pray
it
beautiful
screeched
the
and
so
jack
was
delighted
when
she
managed
slowly
to
say
this
long
word
with
her
black
tongue
and
he
burst
out
laughing
in
the
mean
time
a
good
many
of
the
brown
people
came
running
together
attracted
by
the
noise
of
the
parrots
and
the
rage
of
the
gypsy
who
flung
at
his
cage
one
after
the
other
all
the
largest
things
she
had
in
her
cart
but
nothing
did
the
parrot
any
harm
the
more
violently
his
cage
swung
the
louder
he
sang
till
at
last
the
wicked
gypsy
seized
her
poor
little
young
baby
who
was
lying
in
her
arms
rushed
frantically
at
the
cage
as
it
flew
swiftly
through
the
air
towards
her
and
struck
at
it
with
the
little
creature
head
oh
you
cruel
cruel
woman
cried
jack
and
all
the
small
mothers
who
were
standing
near
with
their
skinny
children
on
their
shoulders
screamed
out
with
terror
and
indignation
but
only
for
one
instant
for
the
handkerchief
flew
off
that
had
covered
its
face
and
was
caught
in
the
wires
of
the
cage
and
all
the
people
saw
that
it
was
not
a
real
baby
at
all
but
a
bundle
of
clothes
and
its
head
was
a
turnip
yes
a
turnip
you
could
see
that
as
plainly
as
possible
for
though
the
green
leaves
had
been
cut
off
their
stalks
were
visible
through
the
lace
cap
that
had
been
tied
on
it
upon
this
all
the
crowd
pressed
closer
throwing
her
baskets
and
brushes
and
laces
and
beads
at
the
gypsy
and
calling
out
we
will
have
none
of
your
goods
you
false
woman
give
us
back
our
money
or
we
will
drive
you
out
of
the
fair
you
stuck
a
stick
into
a
turnip
and
dressed
it
up
in
baby
clothes
you
a
cheat
a
cheat
my
sweet
gentlemen
my
kind
ladies
began
the
gypsy
but
baskets
and
brushes
flew
at
her
so
fast
that
she
was
obliged
to
sit
down
on
the
grass
and
hold
up
the
sham
baby
to
screen
her
face
while
this
was
going
on
jack
felt
that
the
cobwebs
which
had
seemed
to
float
about
his
face
were
all
gone
he
did
not
care
at
all
any
more
about
the
gypsy
and
began
to
watch
the
parrots
with
great
attention
he
observed
that
when
the
handkerchief
stuck
between
the
cage
wires
the
parrots
caught
it
and
drew
it
inside
and
then
jack
saw
the
cunning
old
bird
himself
lay
it
on
the
floor
fold
it
crosswise
like
a
shawl
and
put
it
on
his
wife
then
she
jumped
upon
the
perch
and
held
it
with
one
foot
looking
precisely
like
an
old
lady
with
a
parrot
head
then
he
folded
handkerchief
in
the
same
way
put
it
on
and
got
upon
the
perch
beside
his
wife
screaming
out
in
his
most
piercing
tone
i
like
shawls
they
so
becoming
now
the
gypsy
did
not
care
at
all
what
those
inferior
people
thought
of
her
and
she
was
calmly
counting
out
their
money
to
return
it
but
she
was
very
desirous
to
make
jack
forget
her
behavior
and
had
begun
to
smile
again
and
tell
him
she
had
only
been
joking
when
the
parrot
spoke
and
looking
up
she
saw
the
two
birds
sitting
side
by
side
and
the
was
screaming
in
her
mate
ear
though
neither
of
them
was
at
all
deaf
if
jack
lets
her
allure
him
into
the
woods
he
never
come
out
again
she
hang
him
up
in
a
cage
as
she
did
us
i
say
how
does
my
shawl
fit
so
saying
the
whisked
herself
round
on
the
perch
and
lo
in
the
corner
of
the
handkerchief
were
seen
some
curious
letters
marked
in
red
when
the
crowd
saw
these
they
drew
a
little
farther
off
and
glanced
at
one
another
with
alarm
you
look
charming
my
dear
it
fits
well
screamed
the
old
parrot
in
answer
a
word
in
your
ear
and
share
alike
is
a
fine
motto
what
do
you
mean
by
all
this
said
the
gypsy
rising
and
going
with
slow
steps
to
the
cage
and
speaking
cautiously
jack
said
the
parrot
do
they
ever
eat
handkerchiefs
in
your
part
of
the
country
no
never
answered
jack
hold
your
tongue
and
be
reasonable
said
the
gypsy
trembling
what
do
you
want
i
do
it
whatever
it
is
but
do
they
never
pick
out
the
marks
continued
the
parrot
o
jack
are
you
sure
they
never
pick
out
the
marks
the
marks
said
jack
considering
yes
perhaps
they
do
stop
cried
the
gypsy
as
the
old
parrot
made
a
peck
at
the
strange
letters
oh
you
hurting
me
what
do
you
want
i
say
again
tell
me
what
you
want
and
you
shall
have
it
we
want
to
get
out
replied
the
parrot
you
must
undo
the
spell
then
give
me
my
handkerchief
answered
the
gypsy
to
bandage
my
eyes
i
dare
not
say
the
words
with
my
eyes
open
you
had
no
business
to
steal
it
it
was
woven
by
human
hands
so
that
nobody
can
see
through
it
and
if
you
do
give
it
to
me
you
never
get
out
no
never
then
said
the
old
parrot
tossing
his
shawl
off
you
may
have
jack
handkerchief
it
will
bandage
your
eyes
just
as
well
it
was
woven
over
the
water
as
yours
was
it
wo
do
cried
the
gypsy
in
terror
give
me
my
own
i
tell
you
answered
the
parrot
that
you
shall
have
handkerchief
you
can
do
no
harm
with
that
by
this
time
the
parrots
all
around
had
become
perfectly
silent
and
none
of
the
people
ventured
to
say
a
word
for
they
feared
the
malice
of
the
gypsy
she
was
trembling
dreadfully
and
her
dark
eyes
which
had
been
so
bright
and
piercing
had
become
dull
and
almost
dim
but
when
she
found
there
was
no
help
for
it
she
said
well
pass
out
jack
handkerchief
i
will
set
you
free
if
you
will
bring
out
mine
with
you
share
and
share
alike
answered
the
parrot
you
must
let
all
my
friends
out
too
then
i
wo
let
you
out
answered
the
gypsy
you
shall
come
out
first
and
give
me
my
handkerchief
or
not
one
of
their
cages
will
i
undo
so
take
your
choice
my
friends
then
answered
the
brave
old
parrot
and
he
poked
jack
handkerchief
out
to
her
through
the
wires
the
wondering
crowd
stood
by
to
look
and
the
gypsy
bandaged
her
eyes
tightly
with
the
handkerchief
and
then
stooping
low
she
began
to
murmur
something
and
clap
her
hands
softly
at
first
but
by
degrees
more
and
more
violently
the
noise
was
meant
to
drown
the
words
she
muttered
but
as
she
went
on
clapping
the
bottom
of
cage
after
cage
fell
clattering
down
out
flew
the
parrots
by
hundreds
screaming
and
congratulating
one
another
and
there
was
such
a
deafening
din
that
not
only
the
sound
of
her
spell
but
the
clapping
of
her
hands
was
quite
lost
in
it
but
all
this
time
jack
was
very
busy
for
the
moment
the
gypsy
had
tied
up
her
eyes
the
old
parrot
snatched
the
real
handkerchief
off
his
wife
shoulders
and
tied
it
round
her
neck
then
she
pushed
out
her
head
through
the
wires
and
the
old
parrot
called
to
jack
and
said
pull
jack
took
the
ends
of
the
handkerchief
pulled
terribly
hard
and
stopped
go
on
go
on
screamed
the
old
parrot
i
shall
pull
her
head
off
cried
jack
no
matter
cried
the
parrot
no
matter
only
pull
well
jack
did
pull
and
he
actually
did
pull
her
head
off
nearly
tumbling
backward
himself
as
he
did
it
but
he
saw
what
the
whole
thing
meant
then
for
there
was
another
head
inside
a
fairy
head
jack
flung
down
the
old
parrot
head
and
great
beak
for
he
saw
that
what
he
had
to
do
was
to
clear
the
fairy
of
its
parrot
covering
the
poor
little
creature
seemed
nearly
dead
it
was
so
terribly
squeezed
in
the
wires
it
had
a
green
gown
or
robe
on
with
an
ermine
collar
and
jack
got
hold
of
this
dress
stripped
the
fairy
out
of
the
parrot
feathers
and
dragged
her
through
velvet
robe
and
crimson
girdle
and
little
yellow
shoes
she
was
very
much
exhausted
but
a
kind
brown
woman
took
her
instantly
and
laid
her
in
her
bosom
she
was
a
splendid
little
creature
about
half
a
foot
long
there
a
brave
boy
cried
the
parrot
jack
glanced
round
and
saw
that
not
all
the
parrots
were
free
yet
the
gypsy
was
still
muttering
her
spell
he
returned
the
handkerchief
to
the
parrot
who
put
it
round
his
own
neck
and
again
jack
pulled
but
oh
what
a
tough
old
parrot
that
was
and
how
jack
tugged
before
his
cunning
head
would
come
off
it
did
however
at
last
and
just
as
a
fine
fairy
was
pulled
through
leaving
his
parrot
skin
and
the
handkerchief
behind
him
the
gypsy
untied
her
eyes
and
saw
what
jack
had
done
give
me
my
handkerchief
she
screamed
in
despair
it
in
the
cage
gypsy
answered
jack
you
can
get
it
yourself
say
your
words
again
but
the
gypsy
spell
would
only
open
places
where
she
had
confined
fairies
and
no
fairies
were
in
the
cage
now
no
no
no
she
screamed
too
late
hide
me
o
good
people
hide
me
but
it
was
indeed
too
late
the
parrots
had
been
wheeling
in
the
air
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
them
high
above
her
head
and
as
she
ceased
speaking
she
fell
shuddering
on
the
ground
drew
her
cloak
over
her
face
and
down
they
came
swooping
in
one
immense
flock
and
settled
so
thickly
all
over
her
that
she
was
completely
covered
from
her
shoes
to
her
head
not
an
atom
of
her
was
to
be
seen
all
the
people
stood
gravely
looking
on
so
did
jack
but
he
could
not
see
much
for
the
fluttering
of
the
parrots
nor
hear
anything
for
their
screaming
voices
but
at
last
he
made
one
of
the
cross
people
hear
when
he
shouted
to
her
what
are
they
going
to
do
to
the
poor
gypsy
make
her
take
her
other
form
she
replied
and
then
she
can
not
hurt
us
while
she
stays
in
our
country
she
is
a
fairy
as
we
have
just
found
out
and
all
fairies
have
two
forms
oh
said
jack
but
he
had
no
time
for
more
questions
the
screaming
and
fighting
and
tossing
about
of
little
bits
of
cloth
and
cotton
ceased
a
black
lump
heaved
itself
up
from
the
ground
among
the
parrots
and
as
they
flew
aside
an
ugly
great
condor
with
a
bare
neck
spread
out
its
wings
and
skimming
the
ground
sailed
slowly
away
they
have
pecked
her
so
that
she
can
hardly
rise
exclaimed
the
parrot
fairy
set
me
on
your
shoulder
jack
and
let
me
see
the
end
of
it
jack
set
him
there
and
his
little
wife
who
had
recovered
herself
sprang
from
her
friend
the
brown
woman
and
sat
on
the
other
shoulder
he
then
ran
on
the
tribe
of
brown
people
and
mushroom
people
and
the
folks
running
too
after
the
great
black
bird
who
skimmed
slowly
on
before
them
till
she
got
to
the
gypsy
carts
when
out
rushed
the
gypsies
armed
with
poles
spades
and
everything
they
could
get
hold
of
to
beat
back
the
people
and
the
parrots
from
hunting
their
relation
who
had
folded
her
tired
wings
and
was
skulking
under
a
cart
with
ruffled
feathers
and
a
scowling
eye
jack
was
so
frightened
at
the
violent
way
in
which
the
gypsies
and
the
other
tribes
were
knocking
each
other
about
that
he
ran
off
thinking
he
had
seen
enough
of
such
a
dangerous
country
as
he
passed
the
place
where
that
gypsy
had
been
changed
he
found
the
ground
strewed
with
little
bits
of
her
clothes
many
parrots
were
picking
them
up
and
poking
them
into
the
cage
where
the
handkerchief
was
and
presently
another
parrot
came
with
a
lighted
brand
which
she
had
pulled
from
one
of
the
gypsies
fires
that
right
said
the
fairy
on
jack
shoulder
when
he
saw
his
friend
push
the
brand
between
the
wires
of
what
had
been
his
cage
and
set
the
gypsy
handkerchief
on
fire
and
all
the
bits
of
her
clothes
with
it
she
wo
find
much
of
herself
here
he
observed
as
jack
went
on
it
will
not
be
very
easy
to
put
herself
together
again
so
jack
moved
away
he
was
tired
of
the
noise
and
confusion
and
the
sun
was
just
setting
as
he
reached
the
little
creek
where
his
boat
lay
then
the
parrot
fairy
and
his
wife
sprang
down
and
kissed
their
hands
to
him
as
he
stepped
on
board
and
pushed
the
boat
off
he
saw
when
he
looked
back
that
a
great
fight
was
still
going
on
so
he
was
glad
to
get
away
and
he
wished
his
two
friends
and
set
off
the
old
parrot
fairly
calling
after
him
my
relations
have
put
some
of
our
favorite
food
on
board
for
you
then
they
again
thanked
him
for
his
good
help
and
sprang
into
a
tree
and
the
boat
began
to
go
down
the
wonderful
river
this
has
been
a
most
extraordinary
day
thought
jack
the
strangest
day
i
have
had
yet
and
after
he
had
eaten
a
good
supper
of
what
the
parrots
had
brought
he
felt
so
tired
and
sleepy
that
he
laid
down
in
the
boat
and
presently
fell
fast
asleep
his
fairies
were
sound
asleep
too
in
his
pockets
and
nothing
happened
of
the
least
consequence
so
he
slept
comfortably
till
morning
chapter
vi
the
town
with
nobody
in
it
master
quoth
the
auld
hound
where
will
ye
go
over
moss
over

and
een
that
look
down
a
gold
girdle
for
her
waist
and
a
purple
gown
she
has
a
good
word
forbye
fra
a
folk
in
the
town
soon
after
sunrise
they
came
to
a
great
city
and
it
was
perfectly
still
there
were
grand
towers
and
terraces
wharves
too
and
a
large
market
but
there
was
nobody
anywhere
to
be
seen
jack
thought
that
might
be
because
it
was
so
early
in
the
morning
and
when
the
boat
ran
itself
up
against
a
wooden
wharf
and
stopped
he
jumped
ashore
for
he
thought
this
must
be
the
end
of
his
journey
a
delightful
town
it
was
if
only
there
had
been
any
people
in
it
the
was
full
of
stalls
on
which
were
spread
toys
baskets
fruit
butter
vegetables
and
all
the
other
things
that
are
usually
sold
in
a
market
jack
walked
about
in
it
then
he
looked
in
at
the
open
doors
of
the
houses
and
at
last
finding
that
they
were
all
empty
he
walked
into
one
looked
at
the
rooms
examined
the
rang
the
bells
and
set
the
going
then
after
he
had
shouted
a
good
deal
and
tried
in
vain
to
make
some
one
hear
he
went
back
to
the
edge
of
the
river
where
his
boat
was
lying
and
the
water
was
so
delightfully
clear
and
calm
that
he
thought
he
would
bathe
so
he
took
off
his
clothes
and
folding
them
very
carefully
so
as
not
to
hurt
the
fairies
laid
them
down
beside
a
and
went
in
and
ran
about
and
paddled
for
a
long
time
much
longer
than
there
was
any
occasion
for
but
then
he
had
nothing
to
do
when
at
last
he
had
finished
he
ran
to
the
and
began
to
dress
himself
but
he
could
not
find
his
stockings
and
after
looking
about
for
some
time
he
was
obliged
to
put
on
his
clothes
without
them
and
he
was
going
to
put
his
boots
on
his
bare
feet
when
walking
to
the
other
side
of
the
he
saw
a
little
old
woman
about
as
large
as
himself
she
had
a
pair
of
spectacles
on
and
she
was
knitting
she
looked
so
that
jack
asked
her
if
she
knew
anything
about
his
stockings
it
will
be
time
enough
to
ask
for
them
when
you
have
had
your
breakfast
said
she
sit
down
welcome
to
our
town
how
do
you
like
it
illustration
jack
new
friend
she
had
a
pair
of
spectacles
on
and
she
was
knitting
page
i
should
like
it
very
much
indeed
said
jack
if
there
was
anybody
in
it
i
glad
of
that
said
the
woman
you
seen
a
good
deal
of
it
but
it
pleases
me
to
find
that
you
are
a
very
honest
boy
you
did
not
take
anything
at
all
i
am
honest
too
yes
said
jack
of
course
you
are
and
as
i
am
pleased
with
you
for
being
honest
continued
the
little
woman
i
shall
give
you
some
breakfast
out
of
my
basket
so
she
took
out
a
saucer
full
of
honey
a
roll
of
bread
and
a
cup
of
milk
thank
you
said
jack
but
i
am
not
a
i
have
got
a
a
shilling
a
sixpence
and
two
pence
so
i
can
buy
this
breakfast
of
you
if
you
like
you
look
very
poor
do
i
said
the
little
woman
softly
and
she
went
on
knitting
and
jack
began
to
eat
the
breakfast
i
wonder
what
has
become
of
my
stockings
said
jack
you
will
never
see
them
any
more
said
the
old
woman
i
threw
them
into
the
river
and
they
floated
away
why
did
you
asked
jack
the
little
woman
took
no
notice
but
presently
she
had
finished
a
beautiful
pair
of
stockings
and
she
handed
them
to
jack
and
said
is
that
like
the
pair
you
lost
oh
no
said
jack
these
are
much
more
beautiful
stockings
than
mine
do
you
like
them
as
well
asked
the
fairy
woman
i
like
them
much
better
said
jack
putting
them
on
how
clever
you
are
would
you
like
to
wear
these
said
the
woman
instead
of
yours
she
gave
jack
such
a
strange
look
when
she
said
this
that
he
was
afraid
to
take
them
and
answered
i
should
like
to
wear
them
if
you
think
i
had
better
not
well
she
answered
i
am
very
honest
as
i
told
you
and
therefore
i
am
obliged
to
say
that
if
i
were
you
i
would
not
wear
those
stockings
on
any
account
why
not
said
jack
for
she
looked
so
that
he
could
not
help
trusting
her
why
not
repeated
the
fairy
why
because
when
you
have
those
stockings
on
your
feet
belong
to
me
oh
said
jack
well
if
you
think
that
matters
i
take
them
off
again
do
you
think
it
matters
yes
said
the
fairy
woman
it
matters
because
i
am
a
slave
and
my
master
can
make
me
do
whatever
he
pleases
for
i
am
completely
in
his
power
so
if
he
found
out
that
i
had
knitted
these
stockings
for
you
he
would
make
me
order
you
to
walk
into
his
mill
the
mill
which
grinds
the
corn
for
the
town
and
there
you
would
have
to
grind
and
grind
till
i
got
free
again
when
jack
heard
this
he
pulled
off
the
beautiful
stockings
and
laid
them
on
the
old
woman
lap
upon
this
she
burst
out
crying
as
if
her
heart
would
break
if
my
fairies
that
i
have
in
my
pocket
would
only
wake
said
jack
i
would
fight
your
master
for
if
he
is
no
bigger
than
you
are
perhaps
i
could
beat
him
and
get
you
away
no
jack
said
the
little
woman
that
would
be
of
no
use
the
only
thing
you
could
do
would
be
to
buy
me
for
my
cruel
master
has
said
that
if
ever
i
am
late
again
he
shall
sell
me
in
the
slave
market
to
the
brown
people
who
work
underground
and
though
i
am
dreadfully
afraid
of
my
master
i
mean
to
be
late
in
hopes
as
you
are
kind
and
as
you
have
some
money
that
you
will
come
to
the
and
buy
me
can
you
buy
me
jack
to
be
your
slave
i
do
want
a
slave
said
jack
and
besides
i
have
hardly
any
money
to
buy
you
with
but
it
is
real
money
said
the
fairy
woman
not
like
what
my
master
has
his
money
has
to
be
made
every
week
for
if
there
comes
a
hot
day
it
cracks
so
it
never
has
time
to
look
old
as
your
does
and
that
is
how
we
know
the
real
money
for
we
can
not
imitate
anything
that
is
old
oh
now
now
it
is
twelve
now
i
am
late
again
and
though
i
said
i
would
do
it
i
am
so
frightened
so
saying
the
little
woman
ran
off
towards
the
town
wringing
her
hands
and
jack
ran
beside
her
how
am
i
to
find
your
master
he
said
o
jack
buy
me
buy
me
cried
the
fairy
woman
you
will
find
me
in
the
bid
high
for
me
go
back
and
put
your
boots
on
and
bid
high
now
jack
had
nothing
on
his
feet
so
he
left
the
poor
little
woman
to
run
into
the
town
by
herself
and
went
back
to
put
his
boots
on
they
were
very
uncomfortable
as
he
had
no
stockings
but
he
did
not
much
mind
that
and
he
counted
his
money
there
was
the
that
his
grandmamma
had
given
him
on
his
birthday
there
was
a
shilling
a
sixpence
and
two
pence
besides
a
silver
which
he
had
forgotten
he
then
marched
into
the
town
and
now
it
was
quite
full
of
people
all
of
them
little
men
and
women
about
his
own
height
they
thought
he
was
somebody
of
consequence
and
they
called
out
to
him
to
buy
their
goods
and
he
bought
some
stockings
and
said
what
i
want
to
buy
now
is
a
slave
so
they
showed
him
the
way
to
the
and
there
whole
rows
of
little
people
were
sitting
while
in
front
of
them
stood
the
slaves
now
jack
had
observed
as
he
came
along
how
very
disrespectful
the
dogs
of
that
town
were
to
the
people
they
had
a
habit
of
going
up
to
them
and
smelling
at
their
legs
and
even
gnawing
their
feet
as
they
sat
before
the
little
tables
selling
their
wares
and
what
made
this
more
surprising
was
that
the
people
did
not
always
seem
to
find
out
when
they
were
being
gnawed
but
the
moment
the
dogs
saw
jack
they
came
and
fawned
on
him
and
two
old
hounds
followed
him
all
the
way
to
the
and
when
he
took
a
seat
one
of
them
laid
down
at
his
feet
and
said
master
set
your
handsome
feet
on
my
back
that
they
may
be
out
of
the
dust
do
be
afraid
of
him
said
the
other
hound
he
wo
gnaw
your
feet
he
knows
well
enough
that
they
are
real
ones
are
the
other
people
feet
not
real
asked
jack
of
course
not
said
the
hound
they
had
a
feud
long
ago
with
the
fairies
and
they
all
went
one
night
into
a
great
which
belonged
to
these
enemies
of
theirs
intending
to
steal
the
corn
so
they
made
themselves
invisible
as
they
are
always
obliged
to
do
till
twelve
at
noon
but
before
morning
dawn
the
wheat
being
quite
ripe
down
came
the
fairies
with
their
sickles
surrounded
the
field
and
cut
the
corn
so
all
their
legs
of
course
got
cut
off
with
it
for
when
they
are
invisible
they
can
not
stir
ever
since
that
they
have
been
obliged
to
make
their
legs
of
wood
while
the
hound
was
telling
this
story
jack
looked
about
but
he
did
not
see
one
slave
who
was
in
the
least
like
his
poor
little
friend
and
he
was
beginning
to
be
afraid
that
he
should
not
find
her
when
he
heard
two
people
talking
together
said
one
so
you
have
sold
that
slave
of
yours
yes
answered
a
very
old
man
she
was
late
again
this
morning
and
came
to
me
crying
and
praying
to
be
forgiven
but
i
was
determined
to
make
an
example
of
her
so
i
sold
her
at
once
to
and
he
has
just
driven
her
away
to
work
in
his
mine
jack
on
hearing
this
whispered
to
the
hound
at
his
feet
if
you
will
guide
me
to
clink
hole
you
shall
be
my
dog
master
i
will
do
my
best
answered
the
hound
and
he
stole
softly
out
of
the
market
jack
following
him
chapter
vii
so
useful
it
is
to
have
money
heigh
ho
so
useful
it
is
to
have
money
clough
the
old
hound
went
straight
through
the
town
smelling
footsteps
till
he
came
into
a
large
field
of
barley
and
there
sitting
against
a
sheaf
for
it
was
harvest
time
they
found
he
was
a
very
ugly
little
brown
man
and
he
was
smoking
a
pipe
in
the
shade
while
crouched
near
him
was
the
poor
little
woman
with
her
hands
spread
before
her
face
sir
said
clink
to
jack
you
are
a
stranger
here
no
doubt
yes
said
jack
i
only
arrived
this
morning
have
you
seen
the
town
asked
clink
civilly
there
is
a
very
fine
market
yes
i
have
seen
the
market
answered
jack
i
went
into
it
to
buy
a
slave
but
i
did
not
see
one
that
i
liked
ah
said
clink
and
yet
they
had
some
very
fine
articles
here
he
pointed
to
the
poor
little
woman
and
said
now
that
a
useful
body
enough
and
i
had
her
very
cheap
what
did
you
give
for
her
said
jack
sitting
down
three
pitchers
said
clink
and
fifteen
cups
and
saucers
and
two
shillings
in
the
money
of
the
town
is
their
money
like
this
said
jack
taking
out
his
shilling
when
clink
saw
the
shilling
he
changed
color
and
said
very
earnestly
where
did
you
get
that
dear
sir
oh
it
was
given
me
said
jack
carelessly
clink
looked
hard
at
the
shilling
and
so
did
the
fairy
woman
and
jack
let
them
look
some
time
for
he
amused
himself
with
throwing
it
up
several
times
and
catching
it
at
last
he
put
it
back
in
his
pocket
and
then
clink
heaved
a
deep
sigh
then
jack
took
out
a
penny
and
began
to
toss
that
up
upon
which
to
his
great
surprise
the
little
brown
man
fell
on
his
knees
and
said
oh
a
shilling
and
a
penny
a
shilling
and
a
penny
of
mortal
coin
what
would
i
not
give
for
a
shilling
and
a
penny
i
do
believe
you
have
got
anything
to
give
said
jack
cunningly
i
see
nothing
but
that
ring
on
your
finger
and
the
old
woman
but
i
have
a
great
many
things
at
home
sir
said
the
brown
man
wiping
his
eyes
and
besides
that
ring
would
be
cheap
at
a
shilling
even
a
shilling
of
mortal
coin
would
the
slave
be
cheap
at
a
penny
said
jack
would
you
give
a
penny
for
her
dear
sir
inquired
clink
trembling
with
eagerness
she
is
honest
answered
jack
ask
her
whether
i
had
better
buy
her
with
this
penny
it
does
not
matter
what
she
says
replied
the
brown
man
i
would
sell
twenty
such
as
she
is
for
a
penny
a
real
one
ask
her
repeated
jack
and
the
poor
little
woman
wept
bitterly
but
she
said
no
why
not
asked
jack
but
she
only
hung
down
her
head
and
cried
i
make
you
suffer
for
this
said
the
brown
man
but
when
jack
took
out
the
shilling
and
said
shall
i
buy
you
with
this
slave
his
eyes
actually
shot
out
sparks
he
was
so
eager
speak
he
said
to
the
fairy
woman
and
if
you
do
say
strike
you
he
can
not
buy
me
with
that
answered
the
fairy
woman
unless
it
is
the
most
valuable
coin
he
has
got
the
brown
man
on
hearing
this
rose
up
in
a
rage
and
was
just
going
to
strike
her
a
terrible
blow
when
jack
cried
out
stop
and
took
out
his
can
i
buy
you
with
this
said
he
and
the
fairy
woman
answered
yes
upon
this
clink
drew
a
long
breath
and
his
eyes
grew
bigger
and
bigger
as
he
gazed
at
the
shall
she
be
my
slave
forever
and
not
yours
said
jack
if
i
give
you
this
she
shall
said
the
brown
man
and
he
made
such
a
low
bow
as
he
took
the
money
that
his
head
actually
knocked
the
ground
then
he
jumped
up
and
as
if
he
was
afraid
jack
should
repent
of
his
bargain
he
ran
off
towards
the
hole
in
the
hill
with
all
his
might
shouting
for
joy
as
he
went
slave
said
jack
that
is
a
very
ragged
old
apron
that
you
have
got
and
your
gown
is
quite
worn
out
do
you
think
we
had
better
spend
my
shilling
in
buying
you
some
new
clothes
you
look
so
very
shabby
do
i
said
the
fairy
woman
gently
well
master
you
will
do
as
you
please
but
you
know
better
than
i
do
said
jack
though
you
are
my
slave
you
had
better
give
me
the
shilling
then
answered
the
little
old
woman
and
then
i
advise
you
to
go
back
to
the
boat
and
wait
there
till
i
come
what
said
jack
can
you
go
all
the
way
back
into
the
town
again
i
think
you
must
be
tired
for
you
know
you
are
so
very
old
the
fairy
woman
laughed
when
jack
said
this
and
she
had
such
a
sweet
laugh
that
he
loved
to
hear
it
but
she
took
the
shilling
and
trudged
off
to
the
town
and
he
went
back
to
the
boat
his
hound
running
after
him
he
was
a
long
time
going
for
he
ran
a
good
many
times
after
butterflies
and
then
he
climbed
up
several
trees
and
altogether
he
amused
himself
for
such
a
long
while
that
when
he
reached
the
boat
his
fairy
woman
was
there
before
him
so
he
stepped
on
board
the
hound
followed
and
the
boat
immediately
began
to
swim
on
why
you
have
not
bought
any
new
clothes
said
jack
to
his
slave
no
master
answered
the
fairy
woman
but
i
have
bought
what
i
wanted
and
she
took
out
of
her
pocket
a
little
tiny
piece
of
purple
ribbon
with
a
satin
edge
and
a
very
small
comb
when
jack
saw
these
he
was
vexed
and
said
what
do
you
mean
by
being
so
silly
i
ca
scold
you
properly
because
i
do
know
what
name
to
call
you
by
and
i
do
like
to
say
because
that
sounds
so
rude
why
this
bit
of
ribbon
is
such
a
little
bit
that
it
of
no
use
at
all
it
not
large
enough
even
to
make
one
mitten
of
is
it
said
the
slave
just
take
hold
of
it
master
and
let
us
see
if
it
will
stretch
so
jack
did
and
she
pulled
and
he
pulled
and
very
soon
the
silk
had
stretched
till
it
was
nearly
as
large
as
a
handkerchief
and
then
she
shook
it
and
they
pulled
again
this
is
very
good
fun
said
jack
why
now
it
is
as
large
as
an
apron
so
she
shook
it
again
and
gave
it
a
twitch
here
and
a
pat
there
and
then
they
pulled
again
and
the
silk
suddenly
stretched
so
wide
that
jack
was
very
nearly
falling
overboard
so
jack
slave
pulled
off
her
ragged
gown
and
apron
and
put
it
on
it
was
a
most
beautiful
robe
of
purple
silk
it
had
a
gold
border
and
it
just
fitted
her
illustration
jack
slave
these
are
fairies
said
jack
slave
but
what
are
you
page
that
will
do
she
said
and
then
she
took
out
the
little
comb
pulled
off
her
cap
and
threw
it
into
the
river
she
had
a
little
knot
of
soft
gray
hair
and
she
let
it
down
and
began
to
comb
and
as
she
combed
the
hair
got
much
longer
and
thicker
till
it
fell
in
waves
all
about
her
throat
then
she
combed
again
and
it
all
turned
and
came
tumbling
down
to
her
waist
and
then
she
stood
up
in
the
boat
and
combed
once
more
and
shook
out
the
hair
and
there
was
such
a
quantity
that
it
reached
down
to
her
feet
and
she
was
so
covered
with
it
that
you
could
not
see
one
bit
of
her
excepting
her
eyes
which
peeped
out
and
looked
bright
and
full
of
tears
then
she
began
to
gather
up
her
lovely
locks
and
when
she
had
dried
her
eyes
with
them
she
said
master
do
you
know
what
you
have
done
look
at
me
now
so
she
threw
back
the
hair
from
her
face
and
it
was
a
beautiful
young
face
and
she
looked
so
happy
that
jack
was
glad
he
had
bought
her
with
his
so
glad
that
he
could
not
help
crying
and
the
fair
slave
cried
too
and
then
instantly
the
little
fairies
woke
and
sprang
out
of
jack
pockets
as
they
did
so
jovinian
cried
out
madam
i
am
your
most
humble
servant
and
roxaletta
said
i
hope
your
grace
is
well
but
the
third
got
on
jack
knee
and
took
hold
of
the
buttons
of
his
waistcoat
and
when
the
lovely
slave
looked
at
her
she
hid
her
face
and
blushed
with
pretty
childish
shyness
these
are
fairies
said
jack
slave
but
what
are
you
jack
kissed
me
said
the
little
thing
and
i
want
to
sit
on
his
knee
yes
said
jack
i
took
them
out
and
laid
them
in
a
row
to
see
that
they
were
safe
and
this
one
i
kissed
because
she
looked
such
a
little
dear
was
she
not
like
the
others
then
asked
the
slave
yes
said
jack
but
i
liked
her
the
best
she
was
my
favorite
now
the
instant
these
three
fairies
sprang
out
of
jack
pockets
they
got
very
much
larger
in
fact
they
became
fully
grown
that
is
to
say
they
measured
exactly
one
foot
one
inch
in
height
which
as
most
people
know
is
exactly
the
proper
height
for
fairies
of
that
tribe
the
two
who
had
sprung
out
first
were
very
beautifully
dressed
one
had
a
green
velvet
coat
and
a
sword
the
hilt
of
which
was
incrusted
with
diamonds
the
second
had
a
white
spangled
robe
and
the
loveliest
rubies
and
emeralds
round
her
neck
and
in
her
hair
but
the
third
the
one
who
sat
on
jack
knee
had
a
white
frock
and
a
blue
sash
on
she
had
soft
fat
arms
and
a
face
just
like
that
of
a
sweet
little
child
when
jack
slave
saw
this
she
took
the
little
creature
on
her
knee
and
said
to
her
how
comes
it
that
you
are
not
like
your
companions
and
she
answered
in
a
pretty
lisping
voice
it
because
jack
kissed
me
even
so
it
must
be
answered
the
slave
the
love
of
a
mortal
works
changes
indeed
it
is
not
often
that
we
win
anything
so
precious
here
master
let
her
sit
on
your
knee
sometimes
and
take
care
of
her
for
she
can
not
now
take
the
same
care
of
herself
that
others
of
her
race
are
capable
of
so
jack
let
little
mopsa
sit
on
his
knee
and
when
he
was
tired
of
admiring
his
slave
and
wondering
at
the
respect
with
which
the
other
two
fairies
treated
her
and
at
their
cleverness
in
getting
for
her
and
fanning
her
with
feathers
he
curled
himself
up
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
with
his
own
little
favorite
and
taught
her
how
to
play
at
when
they
had
been
playing
some
time
and
mopsa
was
getting
quite
clever
at
the
game
the
lovely
slave
said
master
it
is
a
long
time
since
you
spoke
to
me
and
yet
said
jack
there
is
something
that
i
particularly
want
to
ask
you
about
ask
it
then
she
replied
i
do
like
to
have
a
slave
answered
jack
and
as
you
are
so
clever
do
you
think
you
can
find
out
how
to
be
free
again
i
am
very
glad
you
asked
me
about
that
said
the
fairy
woman
yes
master
i
wish
very
much
to
be
free
and
as
you
were
so
kind
as
to
give
the
most
valuable
piece
of
real
money
you
possessed
in
order
to
buy
me
i
can
be
free
if
you
can
think
of
anything
that
you
really
like
better
than
that
and
if
i
can
give
it
you
oh
there
are
many
things
said
jack
i
like
going
up
this
river
to
fairyland
much
better
but
you
are
going
there
master
said
the
fairy
woman
you
were
on
the
way
before
i
met
with
you
i
like
this
little
child
better
said
jack
i
love
this
little
mopsa
i
should
like
her
to
belong
to
me
she
is
yours
answered
the
fairy
woman
she
belongs
to
you
already
think
of
something
else
jack
thought
again
and
was
so
long
about
it
that
at
last
the
beautiful
slave
said
to
him
master
do
you
see
those
purple
mountains
jack
turned
round
in
the
boat
and
saw
a
splendid
range
of
purple
mountains
going
up
and
up
they
were
very
great
and
steep
each
had
a
crown
of
snow
and
the
sky
was
very
red
behind
them
for
the
sun
was
going
down
at
the
other
side
of
those
mountains
is
fairyland
said
the
slave
but
if
you
can
not
think
of
something
that
you
should
like
better
to
have
than
your
i
can
never
enter
in
the
river
flows
straight
up
to
yonder
steep
precipice
and
there
is
a
chasm
in
it
which
pierces
it
and
through
which
the
river
runs
down
beneath
among
the
very
roots
of
the
mountains
till
it
comes
out
at
the
other
side
thousands
and
thousands
of
the
small
people
will
come
when
they
see
the
boat
each
with
a
silken
thread
in
his
hand
but
if
there
is
a
slave
in
it
not
all
their
strength
and
skill
can
tow
it
through
look
at
those
rafts
on
the
river
on
them
are
the
small
people
coming
up
jack
looked
and
saw
that
the
river
was
spotted
with
rafts
on
which
were
crowded
brown
fairy
sailors
each
one
with
three
green
stripes
on
his
sleeve
which
looked
like
good
conduct
marks
all
these
sailors
were
chattering
very
fast
and
the
rafts
were
coming
down
to
meet
the
boat
all
these
sailors
to
tow
my
slave
said
jack
i
wonder
i
do
wonder
what
you
are
but
the
fairy
woman
only
smiled
and
jack
went
on
i
have
thought
of
something
that
i
should
like
much
better
than
my
i
should
like
to
have
a
little
tiny
bit
of
that
purple
gown
of
yours
with
the
gold
border
then
the
fairy
woman
said
i
thank
you
master
now
i
can
be
free
so
she
told
jack
to
lend
her
his
knife
and
with
it
she
cut
off
a
very
small
piece
of
the
skirt
of
her
robe
and
gave
it
to
him
now
mind
she
said
i
advise
you
never
to
stretch
this
unless
you
want
to
make
some
particular
thing
of
it
for
then
it
will
only
stretch
to
the
right
size
but
if
you
merely
begin
to
pull
it
for
your
own
amusement
it
will
go
on
stretching
and
stretching
and
i
do
know
where
it
will
stop
chapter
viii
a
story
in
the
night
she
told
a
story
in
the
night
and
all
night
through
while
the
moon
was
in
her
glory
and
the
branches
dropped
with
dew
was
my
life
she
told
and
round
it
rose
the
years
as
from
a
deep
in
the
world
great
heart
she
found
it
cradled
like
a
child
asleep
in
the
night
i
saw
her
weaving
by
the
misty
moonbeam
cold
all
the
weft
her
shuttle
cleaving
with
a
sacred
thread
of
gold
ah
she
wept
me
tears
of
sorrow
lulling
tears
so
mystic
sweet
then
she
wove
my
last
and
her
web
lay
at
my
feet
of
my
life
she
made
the
story
i
must
weep
so
soon
was
told
but
your
name
did
lend
it
glory
and
your
love
its
thread
of
gold
by
this
time
as
the
sun
had
gone
down
and
none
of
the
moons
had
risen
it
would
have
been
dark
but
that
each
of
the
rafts
was
rigged
with
a
small
mast
that
had
a
lantern
hung
to
it
by
the
light
of
these
lanterns
jack
saw
crowds
of
little
brown
faces
and
presently
many
rafts
had
come
up
to
the
boat
which
was
now
swimming
very
slowly
every
sailor
in
every
raft
fastened
to
the
boat
side
a
silken
thread
then
the
rafts
were
rowed
to
shore
and
the
sailors
jumped
out
and
began
to
tow
the
boat
along
illustration
a
page
these
crimson
threads
looked
no
stronger
than
the
silk
that
ladies
sew
with
yet
by
means
of
them
the
small
people
drew
the
boat
along
merrily
there
were
so
many
of
them
that
they
looked
like
an
army
as
they
marched
in
the
light
of
the
lanterns
and
torches
jack
thought
they
were
very
happy
though
the
work
was
hard
for
they
shouted
and
sang
the
fairy
woman
looked
more
beautiful
than
ever
now
and
far
more
stately
she
had
on
a
band
of
precious
stones
to
bind
back
her
hair
and
they
shone
so
brightly
in
the
night
that
her
features
could
be
clearly
seen
jack
little
favorite
was
fast
asleep
and
the
other
two
fairies
had
flown
away
he
was
beginning
to
feel
rather
sleepy
himself
when
he
was
roused
by
the
voice
of
his
free
lady
who
said
to
him
jack
there
is
no
one
listening
now
so
i
will
tell
you
my
story
i
am
the
fairy
queen
jack
opened
his
eyes
very
wide
but
he
was
so
much
surprised
that
he
did
not
say
a
word
one
day
long
long
ago
said
the
queen
i
was
discontented
with
my
own
happy
country
i
wished
to
see
the
world
so
i
set
forth
with
a
number
of
the
fairies
and
went
down
the
wonderful
river
thinking
to
see
the
world
so
we
sailed
down
the
river
till
we
came
to
that
town
which
you
know
of
and
there
in
the
very
middle
of
the
stream
stood
a
tower
a
tall
tower
built
upon
a
rock
fairies
are
afraid
of
nothing
but
of
other
fairies
and
we
did
not
think
this
tower
was
so
we
left
our
ship
and
went
up
the
rock
and
into
the
tower
to
see
what
it
was
like
but
just
as
we
had
descended
into
the
dungeon
keep
we
heard
the
gurgling
of
water
overhead
and
down
came
the
tower
it
was
nothing
but
water
enchanted
into
the
likeness
of
stone
and
we
all
fell
down
with
it
into
the
very
bed
of
the
river
of
course
we
were
not
drowned
but
there
we
were
obliged
to
lie
for
we
have
no
power
out
of
our
own
element
and
the
next
day
the
came
down
with
a
net
and
dragged
the
river
picked
us
all
out
of
the
meshes
and
made
us
slaves
the
fairies
got
away
shortly
but
from
that
day
to
this
in
sorrow
and
distress
i
have
had
to
serve
my
masters
luckily
my
crown
had
fallen
off
in
the
water
so
i
was
not
known
to
be
the
queen
but
till
you
came
jack
i
had
almost
forgotten
that
i
had
ever
been
happy
and
free
and
i
had
hardly
any
hope
of
getting
away
how
sorry
your
people
must
have
been
said
jack
when
they
found
you
did
not
come
home
again
no
said
the
queen
they
only
went
to
sleep
and
they
will
not
wake
till
morning
when
i
pass
in
again
they
will
think
i
have
been
absent
for
a
day
and
so
will
the
you
must
not
undeceive
them
if
you
do
they
will
be
very
angry
and
who
is
the
inquired
jack
but
the
queen
blushed
and
pretended
not
to
hear
the
question
so
he
repeated
queen
who
is
the
i
only
had
her
for
a
very
little
while
said
the
queen
evasively
and
how
long
do
you
think
you
have
been
a
slave
queen
asked
jack
i
do
know
said
the
queen
i
have
never
been
able
to
make
up
my
mind
about
that
and
now
all
the
moons
began
to
shine
and
all
the
trees
lighted
themselves
up
for
almost
every
leaf
had
a
glowworm
or
a
on
it
and
the
water
was
full
of
fishes
that
had
shining
eyes
and
now
they
were
close
to
the
steep
mountain
side
and
jack
looked
and
saw
an
opening
in
it
into
which
the
river
ran
it
was
a
kind
of
cave
something
like
a
long
long
church
with
a
vaulted
roof
only
the
pavement
of
it
was
that
magic
river
and
a
narrow
ran
on
either
side
as
they
entered
the
cave
there
was
a
hollow
murmuring
sound
and
the
queen
crown
became
so
bright
that
it
lighted
up
the
whole
boat
at
the
same
time
she
began
to
tell
jack
a
wonderful
story
which
he
liked
very
much
to
hear
but
every
fresh
thing
she
said
he
forgot
what
had
gone
before
and
at
last
though
he
tried
very
hard
to
listen
he
was
obliged
to
go
to
sleep
and
he
slept
soundly
and
never
dreamed
of
anything
till
it
was
morning
he
saw
such
a
curious
sight
when
he
woke
they
had
been
going
through
this
underground
cavern
all
night
and
now
they
were
approaching
its
opening
on
the
other
side
this
opening
because
they
were
a
good
way
from
it
yet
looked
like
a
lovely
little
round
window
of
blue
and
yellow
and
green
glass
but
as
they
drew
on
he
could
see
mountains
blue
sky
and
a
country
all
covered
with
sunshine
he
heard
singing
too
such
as
fairies
make
and
he
saw
some
beautiful
people
such
as
those
fairies
whom
he
had
brought
with
him
they
were
coming
along
the
they
were
all
lady
fairies
but
they
were
not
very
polite
for
as
each
one
came
up
she
took
a
silken
rope
out
of
a
brown
sailor
hand
and
gave
him
a
shove
which
pushed
him
into
the
water
in
fact
the
water
became
filled
with
such
swarms
of
these
sailors
that
the
boat
could
hardly
get
on
but
the
poor
little
brown
fellows
did
not
seem
to
mind
this
conduct
for
they
plunged
and
shook
themselves
about
scattering
a
good
deal
of
spray
then
they
all
suddenly
dived
and
when
they
came
up
again
they
were
ducks
nothing
but
brown
ducks
i
assure
you
with
green
stripes
on
their
wings
and
with
a
great
deal
of
quacking
and
floundering
they
all
began
to
swim
back
again
as
fast
as
they
could
then
jack
was
a
good
deal
vexed
and
he
said
to
himself
if
nobody
thanks
the
ducks
for
towing
us
i
will
so
he
stood
up
in
the
boat
and
shouted
thank
you
ducks
we
are
very
much
obliged
to
you
but
neither
the
queen
nor
these
new
towers
took
the
least
notice
and
gradually
the
boat
came
out
of
that
dim
cave
and
entered
fairyland
while
the
river
became
so
narrow
that
you
could
hear
the
song
of
the
towers
quite
easily
those
on
the
right
bank
sang
the
first
verse
and
those
on
the
left
bank
answered
drop
drop
from
the
leaves
of
lign
aloes
o
drop
from
the
tree
float
up
through
your
clear
river
shallows
white
lilies
beloved
of
the
bee
let
the
people
o
queen
say
and
bless
thee
her
bounty
drops
soft
as
the
dew
and
spotless
in
honor
confess
thee
as
lilies
are
spotless
in
hue
on
the
roof
stands
yon
white
stork
awaking
his
feathers
flush
rosy
the
while
for
lo
from
the
blushing
east
breaking
the
sun
sheds
the
bloom
of
his
smile
let
them
boast
of
thy
word
it
is
certain
we
doubt
it
no
more
let
them
say
than
that
night
dusky
curtain
shall
roll
back
its
folds
for
the
day
master
whispered
the
old
hound
who
was
lying
at
jack
feet
well
said
jack
they
did
invent
that
song
themselves
said
the
hound
the
old
taught
it
to
them
the
woman
whom
they
love
because
she
can
make
them
cry
jack
was
rather
ashamed
of
the
hound
rudeness
in
saying
this
but
the
queen
took
no
notice
and
now
they
had
reached
a
little
which
ran
out
a
few
feet
into
the
river
and
was
strewed
thickly
with
cowslips
and
violets
illustration
the
queen
here
the
boat
stopped
and
the
queen
rose
and
got
out
page
here
the
boat
stopped
and
the
queen
rose
and
got
out
jack
watched
her
a
whole
crowd
of
fairies
came
down
a
garden
to
meet
her
and
he
saw
them
conduct
her
to
a
beautiful
tent
with
golden
poles
and
a
silken
covering
but
nobody
took
the
slightest
notice
of
him
or
of
little
mopsa
or
of
the
hound
and
after
a
long
silence
the
hound
said
well
master
do
you
feel
hungry
why
do
you
go
with
the
others
and
have
some
breakfast
the
queen
did
invite
me
said
jack
but
do
you
feel
as
if
you
could
go
asked
the
hound
of
course
not
answered
jack
but
perhaps
i
may
not
oh
yes
master
replied
the
hound
whatever
you
do
in
fairyland
you
do
are
you
sure
of
that
asked
jack
quite
sure
master
said
the
hound
and
i
am
hungry
too
well
said
jack
i
will
go
there
and
take
mopsa
she
shall
ride
on
my
shoulder
you
may
follow
so
he
walked
up
that
beautiful
garden
till
he
came
to
the
great
tent
a
banquet
was
going
on
inside
all
the
fairies
sat
down
the
sides
of
the
table
and
at
the
top
sat
the
queen
on
a
larger
chair
and
there
were
two
empty
chairs
one
on
each
side
of
her
jack
blushed
but
the
hound
whispering
again
master
whatever
you
can
do
you
may
do
he
came
slowly
up
the
table
towards
the
queen
who
was
saying
as
he
drew
near
where
is
our
trusty
and
the
and
she
took
no
notice
of
jack
so
though
he
could
not
help
feeling
rather
red
and
ashamed
he
went
and
sat
in
the
chair
beside
her
with
mopsa
still
on
his
shoulder
mopsa
laughed
for
joy
when
she
saw
the
feast
the
queen
said
o
jack
i
am
so
glad
to
see
you
and
some
of
the
fairies
cried
out
what
a
delightful
little
creature
that
is
she
can
laugh
perhaps
she
can
also
cry
jack
looked
about
but
there
was
no
seat
for
mopsa
and
he
was
afraid
to
let
her
run
about
on
the
floor
lest
she
should
be
hurt
there
was
a
very
large
dish
standing
before
the
queen
for
though
the
people
were
small
the
plates
and
dishes
were
exactly
like
those
we
use
and
of
the
same
size
this
dish
was
raised
on
a
foot
and
filled
with
grapes
and
peaches
jack
wondered
at
himself
for
doing
it
but
he
saw
no
other
place
for
mopsa
so
he
took
out
the
fruit
laid
it
round
the
dish
and
set
his
own
little
in
the
dish
nobody
looked
in
the
least
surprised
and
there
she
sat
very
happily
biting
an
apple
with
her
small
white
teeth
then
as
they
brought
him
nothing
to
eat
jack
helped
himself
from
some
of
the
dishes
before
him
and
found
that
a
fairy
breakfast
was
very
nice
indeed
in
the
meantime
there
was
a
noise
outside
and
in
stumped
an
elderly
woman
she
had
very
thick
boots
on
a
short
gown
of
red
print
an
orange
cotton
handkerchief
over
her
shoulders
and
a
black
silk
bonnet
she
was
exactly
the
same
height
as
the
queen
for
of
course
nobody
in
fairyland
is
allowed
to
be
any
bigger
than
the
queen
so
if
they
are
not
children
when
they
arrive
they
are
obliged
to
shrink
how
are
you
dear
said
the
queen
i
am
as
well
as
can
be
expected
answered
the
sitting
down
in
the
empty
chair
now
then
where
my
tea
they
never
ready
with
my
cup
of
tea
two
attendants
immediately
brought
a
cup
of
tea
and
set
it
down
before
the
with
a
plate
of
bread
and
butter
and
she
proceeded
to
pour
it
into
the
saucer
and
blow
it
because
it
was
hot
in
so
doing
her
wandering
eyes
caught
sight
of
jack
and
little
mopsa
and
she
set
down
the
saucer
and
looked
at
them
with
attention
now
mopsa
i
am
sorry
to
say
was
behaving
so
badly
that
jack
was
quite
ashamed
of
her
first
she
got
out
of
her
dish
took
something
nice
out
of
the
queen
plate
with
her
fingers
and
ate
it
and
then
as
she
was
going
back
she
tumbled
over
a
melon
and
upset
a
glass
of
red
wine
which
she
wiped
up
with
her
white
frock
after
which
she
got
into
her
dish
again
and
there
she
sat
smiling
and
daubing
her
pretty
face
with
a
piece
of
buttered
muffin
mopsa
said
jack
you
are
very
naughty
if
you
behave
in
this
way
i
shall
never
take
you
out
to
parties
again
pretty
lamb
said
the
it
just
like
a
child
and
then
she
burst
into
tears
and
exclaimed
sobbing
it
many
a
long
day
since
i
seen
a
child
oh
dear
oh
deary
me
upon
this
to
the
astonishment
of
jack
every
one
of
the
guests
began
to
cry
and
sob
too
oh
dear
oh
dear
they
said
to
one
another
we
crying
we
can
cry
just
as
well
as
men
and
women
is
it
delightful
what
a
luxury
it
is
to
cry
to
be
sure
they
were
evidently
quite
proud
of
it
and
when
jack
looked
at
the
queen
for
an
explanation
she
only
gave
him
a
still
little
smile
but
mopsa
crept
along
the
table
to
the
let
her
take
her
and
hug
her
and
seemed
to
like
her
very
much
for
as
she
sat
on
her
knee
she
patted
her
brown
face
with
a
little
dimpled
hand
i
should
like
vastly
well
to
be
her
nurse
said
the
drying
her
eyes
and
looking
at
jack
if
you
always
wash
her
and
put
clean
frocks
on
her
you
may
said
jack
for
just
look
at
her
what
a
figure
she
is
already
upon
this
the
laughed
for
joy
and
again
every
one
else
did
the
same
the
fairies
can
only
laugh
and
cry
when
they
see
mortals
do
so
chapter
ix
after
the
party
this
will
prove
a
brave
kingdom
to
me
where
i
shall
have
my
music
for
nothing
when
breakfast
was
over
the
guests
got
up
one
after
the
other
without
taking
the
least
notice
of
the
queen
and
the
tent
began
to
get
so
thin
and
transparent
that
you
could
see
the
trees
and
the
sky
through
it
at
last
it
looked
only
like
a
colored
mist
with
blue
and
green
and
yellow
stripes
and
then
it
was
gone
and
the
table
and
all
the
things
on
it
began
to
go
in
the
same
way
only
jack
and
the
and
mopsa
were
left
sitting
on
their
chairs
with
the
queen
between
them
presently
the
queen
lips
began
to
move
and
her
eyes
looked
straight
before
her
as
she
sat
upright
in
her
chair
whereupon
the
snatched
up
mopsa
and
seizing
jack
hand
hurried
him
off
exclaiming
come
away
come
away
she
is
going
to
tell
one
of
her
stories
and
if
you
listen
you
be
obliged
to
go
to
sleep
and
sleep
nobody
knows
how
long
jack
did
not
want
to
go
to
sleep
he
wished
to
go
down
to
the
river
again
and
see
what
had
become
of
his
boat
for
he
had
left
his
cap
and
several
other
things
in
it
so
he
parted
from
the
who
took
mopsa
with
her
and
said
he
would
find
her
again
when
he
wanted
her
at
her
and
went
down
to
the
boat
where
he
saw
that
his
faithful
hound
was
there
before
him
it
was
lucky
master
that
i
came
when
i
did
said
the
hound
for
a
dozen
or
so
of
those
fellows
were
just
shoving
it
off
and
you
will
want
it
at
night
to
sleep
in
yes
said
jack
and
i
can
stretch
the
bit
of
purple
silk
to
make
a
canopy
over
head
a
sort
of
awning
for
i
should
not
like
to
sleep
in
tents
or
palaces
that
are
inclined
to
melt
away
so
the
hound
with
his
teeth
and
jack
with
his
hands
pulled
and
pulled
at
the
silk
till
it
was
large
enough
to
make
a
splendid
canopy
like
a
tent
and
it
reached
down
to
the
water
edge
and
roofed
in
all
the
after
part
of
the
boat
so
now
he
had
a
delightful
little
home
of
his
own
and
there
was
no
fear
of
its
being
blown
away
for
no
wind
ever
blows
in
fairyland
all
the
trees
are
quite
still
no
leaf
rustles
and
the
flowers
lie
on
the
ground
exactly
where
they
fall
after
this
jack
told
the
hound
to
watch
his
boat
and
went
himself
in
search
of
the
not
one
fairy
was
to
be
seen
any
more
than
if
he
had
been
in
his
own
country
and
he
wandered
down
the
green
margin
of
the
river
till
he
saw
the
sitting
at
a
small
stall
with
apples
on
it
and
cherries
tied
to
sticks
and
some
nuts
she
had
mopsa
on
her
knee
and
had
washed
her
face
and
put
a
beautiful
clean
white
frock
on
her
where
are
all
the
fairies
gone
to
asked
jack
i
never
take
any
notice
of
that
common
trash
and
their
doings
she
answered
when
the
queen
takes
to
telling
her
stories
they
are
generally
frightened
and
go
and
sit
in
the
tops
of
the
trees
but
you
seem
very
fond
of
mopsa
said
jack
and
she
is
one
of
them
you
will
help
me
to
take
care
of
her
wo
you
tills
she
grows
a
little
older
grows
said
the
laughing
grows
why
you
do
think
surely
that
she
will
ever
be
any
different
from
what
she
is
now
i
thought
she
would
grow
up
said
jack
they
never
change
so
long
as
they
last
answered
the
when
once
they
are
high
mopsa
said
jack
come
here
and
i
measure
you
mopsa
came
dancing
towards
jack
and
he
tried
to
measure
her
first
with
a
yard
measure
that
the
took
out
of
her
pocket
and
then
with
a
stick
and
then
with
a
bit
of
string
but
mopsa
would
not
stand
steady
and
at
last
it
ended
in
their
having
a
good
game
of
romps
together
and
a
race
but
when
he
carried
her
back
sitting
on
his
shoulder
he
was
sorry
to
see
that
the
was
crying
again
and
he
asked
her
kindly
what
she
did
it
for
it
is
because
she
answered
i
shall
never
see
my
own
country
any
more
nor
any
men
and
women
and
children
excepting
such
as
by
a
rare
chance
stray
in
for
a
little
while
as
you
have
done
i
can
go
back
whenever
i
please
said
jack
why
do
you
because
i
came
in
of
my
own
after
i
had
had
fair
warning
that
if
i
came
at
all
it
would
end
in
my
staying
always
besides
i
do
know
that
i
exactly
wish
to
go
home
again
i
should
be
afraid
afraid
of
what
asked
jack
why
there
the
rain
and
the
cold
and
not
having
anything
to
eat
excepting
what
you
earn
and
yet
said
the
i
have
three
boys
of
my
own
at
home
one
of
them
must
be
nearly
a
man
by
this
time
and
the
youngest
is
about
as
old
as
you
are
if
i
went
home
i
might
find
one
or
more
of
those
boys
in
jail
and
then
how
miserable
i
should
be
but
you
are
not
happy
as
it
is
said
jack
i
have
seen
you
cry
yes
said
the
but
now
i
live
here
i
do
care
about
anything
so
much
as
i
used
to
do
i
have
a
satin
gown
and
a
coach
i
asked
when
first
i
came
may
have
a
hundred
and
fifty
satin
gowns
if
you
like
said
the
queen
twenty
coaches
with
six
horses
to
each
but
when
i
had
been
here
a
little
time
and
found
i
could
have
everything
i
wished
for
and
change
it
as
often
as
i
pleased
i
began
not
to
care
for
anything
and
at
last
i
got
so
sick
of
all
their
grand
things
that
i
dressed
myself
in
my
own
clothes
that
i
came
in
and
made
up
my
mind
to
have
a
stall
and
sit
at
it
as
i
used
to
do
selling
apples
and
i
used
to
say
to
myself
have
but
to
wish
with
all
my
heart
to
go
home
and
i
can
go
i
know
that
but
oh
dear
oh
dear
i
could
wish
enough
for
it
would
come
into
my
head
that
i
should
be
poor
or
that
my
boys
would
have
forgotten
me
or
that
my
neighbors
would
look
down
on
me
and
so
i
always
put
off
wishing
for
another
day
now
here
is
the
queen
coming
sit
down
on
the
grass
and
play
with
mopsa
do
let
her
see
us
talking
together
lest
she
should
think
i
have
been
telling
you
things
which
you
ought
not
to
know
jack
looked
and
saw
the
queen
coming
slowly
towards
them
with
her
hands
held
out
before
her
as
if
it
was
dark
she
felt
her
way
yet
her
eyes
were
wide
open
and
she
was
telling
her
stories
all
the
time
do
you
listen
to
a
word
she
says
whispered
the
and
then
in
order
that
jack
might
not
hear
what
the
queen
was
talking
about
she
began
to
sing
she
had
no
sooner
begun
than
up
from
the
river
came
swarms
of
fairies
to
listen
and
hundreds
of
them
dropped
down
from
the
trees
the
queen
too
seemed
to
attend
as
they
did
though
she
kept
murmuring
her
story
all
the
time
and
nothing
that
any
of
them
did
appeared
to
surprise
the
she
sang
as
if
nobody
was
taking
any
notice
at
all
when
i
sit
on
amid
the
comers
and
the
goers
oh
full
oft
i
have
a
vision
of
the
days
without
alloy
and
a
ship
comes
up
the
river
with
a
jolly
gang
of
towers
and
a
yoy
heave
hoy
there
is
busy
talk
around
me
all
about
mine
ears
it
hummeth
but
the
wooden
wharves
i
look
on
and
a
dancing
heaving
buoy
for
is
tidetime
in
the
river
and
she
cometh
oh
she
cometh
with
a
yoy
heave
hoy
then
i
hear
the
water
washing
never
golden
waves
were
brighter
and
i
hear
the
capstan
creaking
is
a
sound
that
can
not
cloy
bring
her
to
to
ship
her
lading
brig
or
schooner
sloop
or
lighter
with
a
haule
yoy
heave
hoy
will
ye
step
aboard
my
dearest
for
the
high
seas
lie
before
us
so
i
sailed
adown
the
river
in
those
days
without
alloy
we
are
launched
but
when
i
wonder
shall
a
sweeter
sound
float
us
than
yon
yoy
heave
hoy
as
the
left
off
singing
the
queen
moved
away
still
murmuring
the
words
of
her
story
and
jack
said
does
the
queen
tell
stories
of
what
has
happened
or
of
what
is
going
to
happen
why
of
what
is
going
to
happen
of
course
replied
the
woman
anybody
could
tell
the
other
sort
because
i
heard
a
little
of
it
observed
jack
i
thought
she
was
talking
of
me
she
said
he
took
the
measure
and
mopsa
stood
still
for
once
and
he
found
she
was
only
one
foot
high
and
she
grew
a
great
deal
after
that
yes
she
can
grow
that
a
fine
hearing
and
a
strange
hearing
said
the
and
what
did
she
mutter
next
of
how
she
heard
me
sobbing
replied
jack
and
while
you
went
on
about
stepping
on
board
the
ship
she
said
was
very
good
to
me
dear
little
fellow
but
fate
is
the
name
of
my
old
mother
and
she
reigns
here
oh
she
reigns
the
fatal
f
is
in
her
name
and
i
can
not
take
it
out
ah
replied
the
they
all
say
that
and
that
they
are
fays
and
that
mortals
call
their
history
fable
they
are
always
crying
out
for
an
alphabet
without
the
fatal
and
then
she
told
how
she
heard
mopsa
sobbing
too
said
jack
sobbing
among
the
reeds
and
rushes
by
the
river
side
there
are
no
reeds
and
no
rushes
either
here
said
the
and
i
have
walked
the
river
from
end
to
end
i
think
much
of
that
part
of
the
story
but
you
are
sure
she
said
that
mopsa
was
short
of
her
proper
height
yes
and
that
she
would
grow
but
that
nothing
in
my
country
we
always
grow
hold
your
tongue
about
you
country
said
the
sharply
do
you
want
to
make
enemies
of
them
all
mopsa
had
been
listening
to
this
and
now
she
said
i
do
love
the
queen
she
slapped
my
arm
as
she
went
by
and
it
hurts
mopsa
showed
her
little
fat
arm
as
she
spoke
and
there
was
a
red
place
on
it
that
odd
too
said
the
there
nothing
red
in
a
common
fairy
veins
they
have
sap
in
them
that
why
they
blush
just
then
the
sun
went
down
and
mopsa
got
up
on
the
lap
and
went
to
sleep
and
jack
being
tired
went
to
his
boat
and
lay
down
under
the
purple
canopy
his
old
hound
lying
at
his
feet
to
keep
guard
over
him
the
next
morning
when
he
woke
a
pretty
voice
called
to
him
jack
jack
and
he
opened
his
eyes
and
saw
mopsa
the
had
dressed
her
in
a
clean
frock
and
blue
shoes
and
her
hair
was
so
long
she
was
standing
on
the
close
to
him
o
jack
i
so
big
she
said
i
grew
in
the
night
look
at
me
jack
looked
yes
mopsa
had
grown
indeed
she
had
only
just
reached
to
his
knee
the
day
before
and
now
her
little
bright
head
when
he
measured
her
came
as
high
as
the
second
button
of
his
waistcoat
but
i
hope
you
will
not
go
on
growing
so
fast
as
this
said
jack
or
you
will
be
as
tall
as
my
mamma
is
in
a
week
or
two
much
too
big
for
me
to
play
with
chapter
mopsa
learns
her
letters
a
b
bit
it
how
ashamed
i
am
jack
said
to
think
that
you
do
know
even
your
letters
mopsa
replied
that
she
thought
that
did
not
signify
and
then
she
and
jack
began
to
play
at
jumping
from
the
boat
on
to
the
bank
and
back
again
and
afterwards
as
not
a
single
fairy
could
be
seen
they
had
breakfast
with
the
where
is
the
queen
asked
jack
the
answered
it
not
the
fashion
to
ask
questions
in
fairyland
that
a
pity
said
jack
for
there
are
several
things
that
i
particularly
want
to
know
about
this
country
may
i
even
ask
how
big
it
is
how
big
said
mopsa
little
mopsa
looking
as
wise
as
possible
why
the
same
size
as
your
world
of
course
jack
laughed
it
the
same
world
that
you
call
yours
continued
mopsa
and
when
i
a
little
older
i
explain
it
all
to
you
if
it
our
world
said
jack
why
are
none
of
us
in
it
excepting
me
and
the
that
because
you
got
something
in
your
world
that
you
call
time
said
mopsa
so
you
talk
about
now
and
you
talk
about
then
and
do
you
asked
jack
i
do
if
i
want
to
make
you
understand
said
mopsa
the
laughed
and
said
to
think
of
the
pretty
thing
talking
so
already
yes
that
right
and
just
what
the
fairies
say
go
on
and
explain
it
to
him
if
you
can
you
know
said
mopsa
that
your
people
say
there
was
a
time
when
there
were
none
of
them
in
the
world
a
time
before
they
were
made
well
this
is
that
time
this
is
long
ago
nonsense
said
jack
then
how
do
i
happen
to
be
here
because
said
mopsa
when
the
albatross
brought
you
she
did
not
fly
with
you
a
long
way
off
but
a
long
way
back
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
years
this
is
your
world
as
you
can
see
but
none
of
your
people
are
here
because
they
are
not
made
yet
i
do
think
any
of
them
will
be
made
for
a
thousand
years
but
i
saw
the
old
ships
answered
jack
in
the
enchanted
bay
that
was
a
border
country
said
mopsa
i
was
asleep
while
you
went
through
those
countries
but
these
are
the
real
fairylands
jack
was
very
much
surprised
when
he
heard
mopsa
say
these
strange
things
and
as
he
looked
at
her
he
felt
that
a
sleep
was
coming
over
him
and
he
could
not
hold
up
his
head
he
felt
how
delightful
it
was
to
go
to
sleep
and
though
the
sprang
to
him
when
she
observed
that
he
was
shutting
his
eyes
and
though
he
heard
her
begging
and
entreating
him
to
keep
awake
he
did
not
want
to
do
so
but
he
let
his
head
sink
down
on
the
mossy
grass
which
was
as
soft
as
a
pillow
and
there
under
the
shade
of
a
guelder
that
kept
dropping
its
white
flowerets
all
over
him
he
had
this
dream
he
thought
that
mopsa
came
running
up
to
him
as
he
stood
by
the
river
and
that
he
said
to
her
oh
mopsa
how
old
we
are
we
have
lived
back
to
the
times
before
adam
and
eve
yes
said
mopsa
but
i
do
feel
old
let
us
go
down
the
river
and
see
what
we
can
find
so
they
got
into
the
boat
and
it
floated
into
the
middle
of
the
river
and
then
made
for
the
opposite
bank
where
the
water
was
warm
and
very
muddy
and
the
river
became
so
very
wide
that
it
seemed
to
be
afternoon
when
they
got
near
enough
to
see
it
clearly
and
what
they
saw
was
a
boggy
country
green
and
full
of
little
rills
but
the
water
which
as
i
told
you
was
thick
and
muddy
the
water
was
full
of
small
holes
you
never
saw
water
with
in
it
but
jack
did
on
all
sides
of
the
boat
he
saw
holes
moving
about
in
pairs
and
some
were
so
close
that
he
looked
and
saw
their
lining
they
were
lined
with
pink
and
they
snorted
jack
was
afraid
but
he
considered
that
this
was
such
a
long
time
ago
that
the
holes
whatever
they
were
could
not
hurt
him
but
it
made
him
start
notwithstanding
when
a
huge
reared
itself
up
close
to
the
boat
and
he
found
that
the
holes
were
the
nostrils
of
creatures
who
kept
all
the
rest
of
themselves
under
water
in
a
minute
or
two
hundreds
of
ugly
popped
up
and
the
boat
danced
among
them
as
they
floundered
about
in
the
water
i
hope
they
wo
upset
us
said
jack
i
wish
you
would
land
mopsa
said
she
would
rather
not
because
she
did
not
like
the
hairy
elephants
there
are
no
such
things
as
hairy
elephants
said
jack
in
his
dream
but
he
had
hardly
spoken
when
out
of
a
wood
close
at
hand
some
huge
creatures
far
larger
than
our
elephants
came
jogging
down
to
the
water
there
were
forty
or
fifty
of
them
and
they
were
covered
with
what
looked
like
tow
in
fact
so
coarse
was
their
shaggy
hair
that
they
looked
as
if
they
were
dressed
in
and
when
they
stood
still
and
shook
themselves
such
clouds
of
dust
flew
out
that
as
it
swept
over
the
river
it
almost
stifled
jack
and
mopsa
odious
exclaimed
jack
sneezing
what
terrible
creatures
these
are
well
answered
mopsa
at
the
other
end
of
the
boat
but
he
could
hardly
see
her
for
the
dust
then
why
do
you
dream
of
them
jack
had
just
decided
to
dream
of
something
else
when
with
a
noise
greater
than
fifty
trumpets
the
elephants
having
shaken
out
all
the
dust
came
thundering
down
to
the
water
to
bathe
in
the
liquid
mud
they
shook
the
whole
country
as
they
plunged
but
that
was
not
all
the
awful
rose
up
and
with
shrill
screams
fell
upon
them
and
gave
them
battle
while
up
from
every
rill
peeped
above
the
rushes
frogs
as
large
as
oxen
and
with
blue
and
green
eyes
that
gleamed
like
the
eyes
of
cats
the
frogs
croaking
and
the
shrill
trumpeting
of
the
elephants
together
with
the
cries
of
the
as
all
these
creatures
fought
with
horn
and
tusk
and
fell
on
one
another
lashing
the
water
into
whirlpools
among
which
the
boat
danced
up
and
down
like
a
cork
the
blinding
spray
and
the
flapping
about
of
great
bats
over
the
boat
and
in
it
so
confused
jack
that
mopsa
had
spoken
to
him
several
times
before
he
answered
o
jack
she
said
at
last
if
you
ca
dream
any
better
i
must
call
the
craken
very
well
said
jack
i
almost
wrapped
up
and
smothered
in
wings
so
call
anything
you
please
thereupon
mopsa
whistled
softly
and
in
a
minute
or
two
he
saw
almost
spanning
the
river
a
hundred
yards
off
a
thing
like
a
rainbow
or
a
slender
bridge
or
still
more
like
one
ring
or
coil
of
an
enormous
serpent
and
presently
the
creature
head
shot
up
like
a
fountain
close
to
the
boat
almost
as
high
as
a
ship
mast
it
was
the
craken
and
when
mopsa
saw
it
she
began
to
cry
and
said
we
are
caught
in
this
crowd
of
creatures
and
we
can
not
get
away
from
the
land
of
dreams
do
help
us
craken
some
of
the
bats
that
hung
to
the
edges
of
the
boat
had
wings
as
large
as
sails
and
the
first
thing
the
craken
did
was
to
stoop
its
lithe
neck
pick
two
or
three
of
them
off
and
eat
them
you
can
swim
your
boat
home
under
my
coils
where
the
water
is
calm
the
craken
said
for
she
is
so
extremely
old
now
that
if
you
do
not
take
care
she
will
drop
to
pieces
before
you
get
back
to
the
present
time
jack
knew
it
was
of
no
use
saying
anything
to
this
formidable
creature
before
whom
the
and
the
elephants
were
rushing
to
the
shore
but
when
he
looked
and
saw
down
the
river
rainbow
behind
rainbow
i
mean
coil
behind
coil
glittering
in
the
sun
like
so
many
glorious
arches
that
did
not
reach
to
the
banks
he
felt
extremely
glad
that
this
was
a
dream
and
besides
that
he
thought
to
himself
it
only
a
fabled
monster
no
it
only
a
fable
to
these
times
said
mopsa
answering
his
thought
but
in
spite
of
that
we
shall
have
to
go
through
all
the
rings
they
went
under
one
silver
green
and
blue
and
gold
the
water
dripped
from
it
upon
them
and
the
boat
trembled
either
because
of
its
great
age
or
because
it
felt
the
rest
of
the
coil
underneath
a
good
way
off
was
another
coil
and
they
went
so
safely
under
that
that
jack
felt
himself
getting
used
to
crakens
and
not
afraid
then
they
went
under
thirteen
more
these
kept
getting
nearer
and
nearer
together
but
besides
that
the
fourteenth
had
not
quite
such
a
high
span
as
the
former
ones
but
there
were
a
great
many
to
come
and
yet
they
got
lower
and
lower
both
jack
and
mopsa
noticed
this
but
neither
said
a
word
the
thirtieth
coil
brushed
jack
cap
off
then
they
had
to
stoop
to
pass
under
the
two
next
and
then
they
had
to
lie
down
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
and
they
got
through
with
the
greatest
difficulty
but
still
before
them
was
another
the
boat
was
driving
straight
towards
it
and
it
lay
so
close
to
the
water
that
the
arch
it
made
was
only
a
foot
high
when
jack
saw
it
he
called
out
no
that
i
can
not
bear
somebody
else
may
do
the
rest
of
this
dream
i
shall
jump
overboard
mopsa
seemed
to
answer
in
quite
a
pleasant
voice
as
if
she
was
not
afraid
no
you
much
better
wake
and
then
she
went
on
jack
jack
why
do
you
wake
then
all
on
a
sudden
jack
opened
his
eyes
and
found
that
he
was
lying
quietly
on
the
grass
that
little
mopsa
really
had
asked
him
why
he
did
not
wake
he
saw
the
queen
too
standing
by
looking
at
him
and
saying
to
herself
did
not
put
him
to
sleep
did
not
put
him
to
sleep
we
do
want
any
more
stories
queen
said
the
in
a
disrespectful
tone
and
she
immediately
began
to
sing
clattering
some
all
the
time
for
a
kettle
was
boiling
on
some
sticks
and
she
was
going
to
make
tea
out
of
doors
the
marten
flew
to
the
finch
nest
feathers
and
moss
and
a
wisp
of
hay
the
arrow
it
sped
to
thy
brown
mate
breast
low
in
the
broom
is
thy
mate
liest
thou
low
love
low
in
the
broom
feathers
and
moss
and
a
wisp
of
hay
warm
the
white
eggs
till
i
learn
his
doom
she
beateth
her
wings
and
away
away
ah
my
sweet
singer
thy
days
are
told
feathers
and
moss
and
a
wisp
of
hay
thine
eyes
are
dim
and
the
eggs
grow
cold
o
mournful
morrow
o
dark
the
finch
flew
back
to
her
cold
cold
nest
feathers
and
moss
and
a
wisp
of
hay
mine
is
the
trouble
that
rent
her
breast
and
home
is
silent
and
love
is
clay
jack
felt
very
tired
indeed
as
much
tired
as
if
he
had
really
been
out
all
day
on
the
river
and
gliding
under
the
coils
of
the
craken
he
however
rose
up
when
the
called
him
and
drank
his
tea
and
had
some
fairy
bread
with
it
which
refreshed
him
very
much
after
tea
he
measured
mopsa
again
and
found
that
she
had
grown
up
to
a
higher
button
she
looked
much
wiser
too
and
when
he
said
she
must
be
taught
to
read
she
made
no
objection
so
he
arranged
daisies
and
buttercups
into
the
forms
of
the
letters
and
she
learnt
nearly
all
of
them
that
one
evening
while
crowds
of
the
fairies
looked
on
hanging
from
the
boughs
and
sitting
in
the
grass
and
shouting
out
the
names
of
the
letters
as
mopsa
said
them
they
were
very
polite
to
jack
for
they
gathered
all
these
flowers
for
him
and
emptied
them
from
their
little
caps
at
his
feet
as
fast
as
he
wanted
them
chapter
xi
sister
sweet
is
childhood
childhood
over
kiss
and
part
sweet
is
youth
but
youth
a
rover
so
my
heart
sweet
is
rest
but
by
all
showing
toil
is
nigh
we
must
go
alas
the
going
say
jack
crept
under
his
canopy
went
to
sleep
early
that
night
and
did
not
wake
till
the
sun
had
risen
when
the
called
him
and
said
breakfast
was
nearly
ready
the
same
thing
never
happens
twice
in
fairyland
so
this
time
the
breakfast
was
not
spread
in
a
tent
but
on
the
river
the
queen
had
cut
off
a
tiny
piece
of
her
robe
the
fairies
had
stretched
it
till
it
was
very
large
and
then
they
had
spread
it
on
the
water
where
it
floated
and
lay
like
a
great
carpet
of
purple
and
gold
one
corner
of
it
was
moored
to
the
side
of
jack
boat
but
he
had
not
observed
this
because
of
his
canopy
however
that
was
now
looped
up
by
the
and
jack
and
mopsa
saw
what
was
going
on
hundreds
of
swans
had
been
towing
the
carpet
along
and
were
still
holding
it
with
their
beaks
while
a
crowd
of
doves
walked
about
on
it
smoothing
out
the
creases
and
patting
it
with
their
pretty
pink
feet
till
it
was
quite
firm
and
straight
the
swans
then
swam
away
and
they
flew
away
presently
troops
of
fairies
came
down
to
the
jumped
into
jack
boat
without
asking
leave
and
so
got
on
to
the
carpet
while
at
the
same
time
a
great
tree
which
grew
on
the
bank
began
to
push
out
fresh
leaves
as
large
as
fans
and
shoot
out
long
branches
which
again
shot
out
others
till
very
soon
there
was
shade
all
over
the
carpet
a
thick
shadow
as
good
as
a
tent
which
was
very
pleasant
for
the
sun
was
already
hot
when
the
queen
came
down
the
tree
suddenly
blossomed
out
with
thousands
of
red
and
white
flowers
you
must
not
go
on
to
that
carpet
said
the
let
us
sit
still
in
the
boat
and
be
served
here
she
whispered
this
as
the
queen
stepped
into
the
boat
jack
said
the
queen
dear
this
was
to
the
and
then
she
stood
still
for
a
moment
and
looked
earnestly
at
little
mopsa
and
sighed
well
she
said
to
her
do
you
mean
to
speak
to
me
then
mopsa
lifted
up
her
pretty
face
and
blushed
very
rosy
red
and
said
in
a
shy
voice
good
morning
sister
i
said
so
exclaimed
the
queen
i
said
so
and
she
lifted
up
her
beautiful
eyes
and
murmured
out
what
is
to
be
done
now
never
mind
queen
dear
said
jack
if
it
was
rude
of
mopsa
to
say
that
she
is
such
a
little
young
thing
that
she
does
not
know
better
it
was
not
rude
said
mopsa
and
she
laughed
and
blushed
again
it
was
not
rude
and
i
am
not
sorry
as
she
said
this
the
queen
stepped
on
to
the
carpet
and
all
the
flowers
began
to
drop
down
they
were
something
like
camellias
and
there
were
thousands
of
them
the
fairies
collected
them
in
little
heaps
they
had
no
tables
and
chairs
nor
any
plates
and
dishes
for
this
breakfast
but
the
queen
sat
down
on
the
carpet
close
to
jack
boat
and
leaned
her
cheek
on
her
hand
and
seemed
to
be
lost
in
thought
the
fairies
put
some
flowers
into
her
lap
then
each
took
some
and
they
all
sat
down
and
looked
at
the
queen
but
she
did
not
stir
at
last
jack
said
when
is
the
breakfast
coming
this
is
the
breakfast
said
the
these
flowers
are
most
delicious
eating
you
never
tasted
anything
so
good
in
your
life
but
we
do
begin
till
the
queen
does
quantities
of
blossoms
had
dropped
into
the
boat
several
fairies
tumbled
into
it
almost
head
over
heels
they
were
in
such
a
hurry
and
they
heaped
them
into
mopsa
lap
but
took
no
notice
of
jack
nor
of
the
either
at
last
when
every
one
had
waited
some
time
the
queen
pulled
a
petal
off
one
flower
and
began
to
eat
so
every
one
else
began
and
what
the
had
said
was
quite
true
jack
knew
that
he
never
had
tasted
anything
half
so
nice
and
he
was
quite
sorry
when
he
could
not
eat
any
more
so
when
every
one
had
finished
the
queen
leaned
her
arm
on
the
edge
of
the
boat
and
turning
her
lovely
face
towards
mopsa
said
i
want
to
whisper
to
you
sister
oh
said
mopsa
i
wish
i
was
in
jack
waistcoat
pocket
again
but
i
so
big
now
and
she
took
hold
of
the
two
sides
of
his
velvet
jacket
and
hid
her
face
between
them
my
old
mother
sent
a
message
last
night
continued
the
queen
in
a
soft
sorrowful
voice
she
is
much
more
powerful
than
we
are
what
is
the
message
asked
mopsa
but
she
still
hid
her
face
so
the
queen
moved
over
and
put
her
lips
close
to
mopsa
ear
and
repeated
it
there
can
not
be
two
queens
in
one
hive
if
mopsa
leaves
the
hive
a
fine
swarm
will
go
with
her
said
the
i
shall
for
one
that
i
shall
no
answered
the
queen
i
hope
not
dear
for
you
know
well
that
this
is
my
old
mother
doing
not
mine
oh
said
mopsa
i
feel
as
if
i
must
tell
a
story
too
just
as
the
queen
does
but
the
broke
out
in
a
very
cross
voice
it
not
at
all
like
fairyland
if
you
go
on
in
this
way
and
i
would
as
lieve
be
out
of
it
as
in
it
then
she
began
to
sing
that
she
and
jack
might
not
hear
mopsa
story
on
the
rocks
by
aberdeen
where
the
whislin
wave
had
been
as
i
wandered
and
at
was
eerie
there
i
saw
thee
sailing
west
and
i
ran
with
joy
opprest
ay
and
took
out
all
my
best
my
dearie
then
i
busked
mysel
wi
speed
and
the
neighbors
cried
what
need
is
a
lass
in
any
weed
aye
bonny
now
my
heart
my
heart
is
sair
what
the
good
though
i
be
fair
for
never
see
me
mair
man
johnnie
while
the
sang
mopsa
finished
her
story
and
the
queen
untied
the
fastening
which
held
her
carpet
to
the
boat
and
went
floating
upon
it
down
the
river
she
said
kissing
her
hand
to
them
i
must
go
and
prepare
for
the
deputation
so
jack
and
mopsa
played
about
all
the
morning
sometimes
in
the
boat
and
sometimes
on
the
shore
while
the
sat
on
the
grass
with
her
arms
folded
and
seemed
to
be
lost
in
thought
at
last
she
said
to
jack
what
was
the
name
of
the
great
bird
that
carried
you
two
here
i
have
forgotten
answered
jack
i
been
trying
to
remember
ever
since
we
heard
the
queen
tell
her
first
story
but
i
can
not
i
remember
said
mopsa
tell
it
then
replied
the
but
mopsa
shook
her
head
i
do
want
jack
to
go
she
answered
i
do
want
to
go
nor
that
you
should
said
jack
but
the
queen
said
can
not
be
two
queens
in
one
hive
and
that
means
that
you
are
going
to
be
turned
out
of
this
beautiful
country
the
other
fairy
lands
are
just
as
nice
answered
mopsa
she
can
only
turn
me
out
of
this
one
i
never
heard
of
more
than
one
fairyland
observed
jack
it
my
opinion
said
the
that
there
are
hundreds
and
those
fairies
are
such
a
saucy
set
that
if
i
were
you
i
should
be
very
glad
to
get
away
from
them
you
been
here
a
very
little
while
as
yet
and
you
no
notion
what
goes
on
when
the
leaves
begin
to
drop
tell
us
said
jack
well
you
must
know
answered
the
that
fairies
can
not
abide
cold
weather
so
when
the
first
rime
frost
comes
they
bury
themselves
bury
themselves
repeated
jack
yes
i
tell
you
they
bury
themselves
you
seen
fairy
rings
of
course
even
in
your
own
country
and
here
the
fields
are
full
of
them
well
when
it
gets
cold
a
company
of
fairies
forms
itself
into
a
circle
and
every
one
digs
a
little
hole
the
first
that
has
finished
jumps
into
his
hole
and
his
next
neighbor
covers
him
up
and
then
jumps
into
his
own
little
hole
and
he
gets
covered
up
in
his
turn
till
at
last
there
is
only
one
left
and
he
goes
and
joins
another
circle
hoping
he
shall
have
better
luck
than
to
be
last
again
i
often
asked
them
why
they
do
that
but
no
fairy
can
ever
give
a
reason
for
anything
they
always
say
that
old
mother
fate
makes
them
do
it
when
they
come
up
again
they
are
not
fairies
at
all
but
the
good
ones
are
mushrooms
and
the
bad
ones
are
toadstools
then
you
think
there
are
no
fairies
in
the
other
countries
said
jack
of
course
not
answered
the
all
the
fairy
lands
are
different
it
only
the
queens
that
are
alike
i
wish
the
fairies
would
not
disappear
for
hours
said
jack
they
all
seem
to
run
off
and
hide
themselves
that
their
way
answered
the
all
fairies
are
part
of
their
time
in
the
shape
of
human
creatures
and
the
rest
of
it
in
the
shape
of
some
animal
these
can
turn
themselves
when
they
please
into
in
the
heat
of
the
day
they
generally
prefer
to
be
in
that
form
and
they
sit
among
the
leaves
of
the
trees
illustration
the
apple
woman
so
she
began
to
sing
page
a
great
many
are
now
with
the
queen
because
there
is
a
deputation
coming
but
if
i
were
to
begin
to
sing
such
a
flock
of
would
gather
round
that
the
boughs
of
the
trees
would
bend
with
their
weight
and
they
would
light
on
the
grass
all
about
so
thickly
that
not
a
blade
of
grass
would
be
seen
as
far
as
the
song
was
heard
so
she
began
to
sing
and
the
air
was
darkened
by
great
flocks
of
these
they
alighted
just
as
she
had
said
and
kept
time
with
their
heads
and
their
feet
nodding
like
a
crowd
of
mandarins
and
yet
it
was
nothing
but
a
stupid
old
song
that
you
would
have
thought
could
have
no
particular
meaning
for
them
like
a
laverock
in
the
lift
i
it
we
two
it
we
two
it
we
two
for
aye
all
the
world
and
we
two
and
heaven
be
our
stay
like
a
laverock
in
the
lift
sing
o
bonny
bride
all
the
world
was
adam
once
with
eve
by
his
side
ii
what
the
world
my
lass
my
love
what
can
it
do
i
am
thine
and
thou
art
mine
life
is
sweet
and
new
if
the
world
have
missed
the
mark
let
it
stand
by
for
we
two
have
gotten
leave
and
once
more
we
try
iii
like
a
laverock
in
the
lift
sing
o
bonny
bride
it
we
two
it
we
two
happy
side
by
side
take
a
kiss
from
me
thy
man
now
the
song
begins
all
is
made
afresh
for
us
and
the
brave
heart
wins
iv
when
the
darker
days
come
and
no
sun
will
shine
thou
shalt
dry
my
tears
lass
and
i
dry
thine
it
we
two
it
we
two
while
the
world
away
sitting
by
the
golden
sheaves
on
our
chapter
xii
they
run
away
from
old
mother
fate
a
land
that
living
warmth
disowns
it
meets
my
wondering
ken
a
land
where
all
the
men
are
stones
or
all
the
stones
are
men
before
the
had
finished
jack
and
mopsa
saw
the
queen
coming
in
great
state
followed
by
thousands
of
the
fairies
and
leading
by
a
ribbon
round
its
neck
a
beautiful
brown
doe
a
great
many
pretty
fawns
were
walking
among
the
fairies
here
the
deputation
said
the
but
as
the
rose
like
a
cloud
at
the
approach
of
the
queen
and
the
fairies
and
fawns
pressed
forward
there
was
a
good
deal
of
noise
and
confusion
during
which
mopsa
stepped
up
close
to
jack
and
whispered
in
his
ear
remember
jack
whatever
you
can
do
you
may
do
then
the
brown
doe
laid
down
at
mopsa
feet
and
the
queen
began
jack
and
mopsa
i
love
you
both
i
had
a
message
last
night
from
my
old
mother
and
i
told
you
what
it
was
yes
queen
said
mopsa
you
did
and
now
continued
the
queen
she
has
sent
this
beautiful
brown
doe
from
the
country
beyond
the
lake
where
they
are
in
the
greatest
distress
for
a
queen
to
offer
mopsa
the
crown
and
jack
it
is
fated
that
mopsa
is
to
reign
there
so
you
had
better
say
no
more
about
it
i
do
want
to
be
a
queen
said
mopsa
pouting
i
want
to
play
with
jack
you
are
a
queen
already
answered
the
real
queen
at
least
you
will
be
in
a
few
days
you
are
so
much
grown
even
since
the
morning
that
you
come
up
nearly
to
jack
shoulder
in
four
days
you
will
be
as
tall
as
i
am
and
it
is
quite
impossible
that
any
one
of
fairy
birth
should
be
as
tall
as
a
queen
in
her
own
country
but
i
do
see
what
stags
and
does
can
want
with
a
queen
said
jack
they
were
obliged
to
turn
into
deer
said
the
queen
when
they
crossed
their
own
border
but
they
are
fairies
when
they
are
at
home
and
they
want
mopsa
because
they
are
always
obliged
to
have
a
queen
of
alien
birth
if
i
go
said
mopsa
shall
jack
go
too
oh
no
answered
the
queen
jack
and
the
are
my
subjects
said
jack
tell
us
what
you
think
shall
mopsa
go
to
this
country
why
child
said
the
go
away
from
here
she
must
but
she
need
not
go
off
with
the
deer
i
suppose
unless
she
likes
they
look
gentle
and
harmless
but
it
is
very
hard
to
get
at
the
truth
in
this
country
and
i
heard
queer
stories
about
them
have
you
said
the
queen
well
you
can
repeat
them
if
you
like
but
remember
that
the
poor
brown
doe
can
not
contradict
them
so
the
said
i
have
heard
but
i
do
know
how
true
it
is
that
in
that
country
they
shut
up
their
queen
in
a
great
castle
and
cover
her
with
a
veil
and
never
let
the
sun
shine
on
her
for
if
by
chance
the
least
little
sunbeam
should
light
on
her
she
would
turn
into
a
doe
directly
and
all
the
nation
would
turn
with
her
and
stay
so
i
do
want
to
be
shut
up
in
a
castle
said
mopsa
but
is
it
true
asked
jack
well
said
the
as
i
told
you
before
i
can
not
make
out
whether
it
true
or
not
for
all
these
stags
and
fawns
look
very
mild
gentle
creatures
i
wo
go
said
mopsa
i
would
rather
run
away
all
this
time
the
queen
with
the
brown
doe
had
been
gently
pressing
with
the
crowd
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
brink
of
the
river
so
that
now
jack
and
mopsa
who
stood
facing
them
were
quite
close
to
the
boat
and
while
they
argued
and
tried
to
make
mopsa
come
away
jack
suddenly
whispered
to
her
to
spring
into
the
boat
which
she
did
and
he
after
her
and
at
the
same
time
he
cried
out
now
boat
if
you
are
my
boat
set
off
as
fast
as
you
can
and
let
nothing
of
fairy
birth
get
on
board
of
you
no
sooner
did
he
begin
to
speak
than
the
boat
swung
itself
away
from
the
edge
and
almost
in
a
moment
it
was
in
the
very
middle
of
the
river
and
beginning
to
float
gently
down
with
the
stream
illustration
they
run
away
from
old
mother
fate
the
boat
swung
itself
away
from
the
edge
and
almost
in
a
moment
it
was
in
the
very
middle
of
the
river
page
now
as
i
have
told
you
before
that
river
runs
up
the
country
instead
of
down
to
the
sea
so
jack
and
mopsa
floated
still
farther
up
into
fairyland
and
they
saw
the
queen
and
the
and
all
the
crowd
of
fawns
and
fairies
walking
along
the
bank
of
the
river
keeping
exactly
to
the
same
pace
that
the
boat
went
and
this
went
on
for
hours
and
hours
so
that
there
seemed
to
be
no
chance
that
jack
and
mopsa
could
land
and
they
heard
no
voices
at
all
nor
any
sound
but
the
baying
of
the
old
hound
who
could
not
swim
out
to
them
because
jack
had
forbidden
the
boat
to
take
anything
of
fairy
birth
on
board
of
her
luckily
the
bottom
of
the
boat
was
full
of
those
delicious
flowers
that
had
dropped
into
it
at
so
there
was
plenty
of
nice
food
for
jack
and
mopsa
and
jack
noticed
when
he
looked
at
her
towards
evening
that
she
was
now
nearly
as
tall
as
himself
and
that
her
lovely
brown
hair
floated
down
to
her
ankles
jack
she
said
before
it
grew
dusk
will
you
give
me
your
little
purse
that
has
the
silver
fourpence
in
it
now
mopsa
had
often
played
with
this
purse
it
was
lined
with
a
nice
piece
of
pale
green
silk
and
when
jack
gave
it
to
her
she
pulled
the
silk
out
and
shook
it
and
patted
it
and
stretched
it
just
as
the
queen
had
done
and
it
came
into
a
most
lovely
cloak
which
she
tied
round
her
neck
then
she
twisted
up
her
long
hair
into
a
coil
and
fastened
it
round
her
head
and
called
to
the
which
were
beginning
to
glitter
on
the
trees
to
come
and
they
came
and
alighted
in
a
row
upon
the
coil
and
turned
into
diamonds
directly
so
now
mopsa
had
got
a
crown
and
a
robe
and
she
was
so
beautiful
that
jack
thought
he
should
never
be
tired
of
looking
at
her
but
it
was
nearly
dark
now
and
he
was
so
sleepy
and
tired
that
he
could
not
keep
his
eyes
open
though
he
tried
very
hard
and
he
began
to
blink
and
then
he
began
to
nod
and
at
last
he
fell
fast
asleep
and
did
not
awake
till
the
morning
then
he
sat
up
in
the
boat
and
looked
about
him
a
wonderful
country
indeed
no
trees
no
grass
no
houses
nothing
but
red
stones
and
red
sand
and
mopsa
was
gone
jack
jumped
on
shore
for
the
boat
had
stopped
and
was
close
to
the
brink
of
the
river
he
looked
about
for
some
time
and
at
last
in
the
shadow
of
a
pale
brown
rock
he
found
her
and
oh
delightful
surprise
the
was
there
too
she
was
saying
o
my
bones
dearie
dearie
me
how
they
do
ache
that
was
not
surprising
for
she
had
been
out
all
night
she
had
walked
beside
the
river
with
the
queen
and
her
tribe
till
they
came
to
a
little
tinkling
stream
which
divides
their
country
from
the
sandy
land
and
there
they
were
obliged
to
stop
they
could
not
cross
it
but
the
sprang
over
and
though
the
queen
told
her
she
must
come
back
again
in
hours
she
did
not
appear
to
be
displeased
now
the
when
they
had
come
to
listen
the
day
before
to
the
song
had
brought
each
of
them
a
grain
of
maize
in
her
beak
and
had
thrown
it
into
her
apron
so
when
she
got
up
she
carried
it
with
her
gathered
up
there
and
now
she
had
been
baking
some
delicious
little
cakes
on
a
fire
of
dry
sticks
that
the
river
had
drifted
down
and
mopsa
had
taken
a
honeycomb
from
the
rock
so
that
they
all
had
a
very
nice
breakfast
and
the
gave
them
a
great
deal
of
good
advice
and
told
them
if
they
wished
to
remain
in
fairyland
and
not
be
caught
by
the
brown
doe
and
her
followers
they
must
cross
over
the
purple
mountains
for
on
the
other
side
of
those
peaks
she
said
i
have
heard
that
fairies
live
who
have
the
best
of
characters
for
being
kind
and
just
i
am
sure
they
would
never
shut
up
a
poor
queen
in
a
castle
but
the
best
thing
you
could
do
dear
she
said
to
mopsa
would
be
to
let
jack
call
the
bird
and
make
her
carry
you
back
to
his
own
country
the
queen
is
not
at
all
kind
said
jack
i
have
been
very
kind
to
her
and
she
should
have
let
mopsa
stay
no
jack
she
could
not
said
mopsa
but
i
wish
i
had
not
grown
so
fast
and
i
do
like
to
go
to
your
country
i
would
rather
run
away
but
who
is
to
tell
us
where
to
run
asked
jack
oh
said
mopsa
some
of
these
people
i
do
see
anybody
said
jack
looking
about
him
mopsa
pointed
to
a
group
of
stones
and
then
to
another
group
and
as
jack
looked
he
saw
that
in
shape
they
were
something
like
people
stone
people
one
stone
was
a
little
like
an
old
man
with
a
mantle
over
him
and
he
was
sitting
on
the
ground
with
his
knees
up
nearly
to
his
chin
another
was
like
a
woman
with
a
hood
on
and
she
seemed
to
be
leaning
her
chin
on
her
hand
close
to
these
stood
something
very
much
like
a
cradle
in
shape
and
beyond
were
stones
that
resembled
a
flock
of
sheep
lying
down
on
the
bare
sand
with
something
that
reminded
jack
of
the
figure
of
a
man
lying
asleep
near
them
with
his
face
to
the
ground
that
was
a
very
curious
country
all
the
stones
reminded
you
of
people
or
of
animals
and
the
shadows
that
they
cast
were
much
more
like
than
the
stones
themselves
there
were
blocks
with
things
that
you
might
have
mistaken
for
stone
ropes
twisted
round
them
but
looking
at
the
shadows
you
could
see
distinctly
that
they
were
trees
and
that
what
coiled
round
were
snakes
then
there
was
a
rocky
prominence
at
one
side
of
which
was
something
like
a
sitting
figure
but
its
shadow
lying
on
the
ground
was
that
of
a
girl
with
a
distaff
jack
was
very
much
surprised
at
all
this
mopsa
was
not
she
did
not
see
she
said
that
one
thing
was
more
wonderful
than
another
all
the
fairy
lands
were
wonderful
but
the
world
was
far
more
so
she
and
jack
went
about
among
the
stones
all
day
and
as
the
sun
got
low
both
the
shadows
and
the
blocks
themselves
became
more
and
more
like
people
and
if
you
went
close
you
could
now
see
features
very
sweet
quiet
features
but
the
eyes
were
all
shut
by
this
time
the
began
to
feel
very
sad
she
knew
she
should
soon
have
to
leave
jack
and
mopsa
and
she
said
to
mopsa
as
they
finished
their
evening
meal
i
wish
you
would
ask
the
inhabitants
a
few
questions
dear
before
i
go
for
i
want
to
know
whether
they
can
put
you
in
the
way
how
to
cross
the
purple
mountains
jack
said
nothing
for
he
thought
he
would
see
what
mopsa
was
going
to
do
so
when
she
got
up
and
went
towards
the
shape
that
was
like
a
cradle
he
followed
and
the
too
mopsa
went
to
the
figure
that
sat
by
the
cradle
it
was
a
stone
yet
but
when
mopsa
laid
her
little
warm
hand
on
its
bosom
it
smiled
dear
said
mopsa
i
wish
you
would
wake
a
curious
little
sound
was
now
heard
but
the
figure
did
not
move
and
the
lifted
mopsa
on
to
the
lap
of
the
statue
then
she
put
her
arms
round
its
neck
and
spoke
to
it
again
very
distinctly
dear
why
do
you
wake
you
had
better
wake
now
the
baby
crying
jack
now
observed
that
the
sound
he
had
heard
was
something
like
the
crying
of
a
baby
he
also
heard
the
figure
answering
mopsa
it
said
i
am
only
a
stone
then
said
mopsa
i
am
not
a
queen
yet
i
can
not
wake
her
take
me
down
i
am
not
warm
said
the
figure
and
that
was
quite
true
and
yet
she
was
not
a
stone
now
which
reminded
one
of
a
woman
but
a
woman
that
reminded
one
of
a
stone
all
the
west
was
very
red
with
the
sunset
and
the
river
was
red
too
and
jack
distinctly
saw
some
of
the
coils
of
rope
glide
down
from
the
trees
and
slip
into
the
water
next
he
saw
the
stones
that
had
looked
like
sheep
raise
up
their
heads
in
the
twilight
and
then
lift
themselves
and
shake
their
woolly
sides
at
that
instant
the
large
white
moon
heaved
up
her
pale
face
between
two
dark
blue
hills
and
upon
this
the
statue
put
out
its
feet
and
gently
rocked
the
cradle
then
it
spoke
again
to
mopsa
what
was
it
that
you
wished
me
to
tell
you
how
to
find
the
way
over
those
purple
mountains
said
mopsa
you
must
set
off
in
an
hour
then
said
the
woman
and
she
had
hardly
anything
of
the
stone
about
her
now
you
can
easily
find
it
by
night
without
any
guide
but
nothing
can
ever
take
you
to
it
by
day
but
we
would
rather
stay
a
few
days
in
this
curious
country
said
jack
let
us
wait
at
least
till
night
the
statue
at
this
moment
rubbed
her
hands
together
as
if
they
still
felt
cold
and
stiff
you
are
quite
welcome
to
stay
she
observed
but
you
had
better
not
why
not
persisted
jack
father
said
the
woman
rising
and
shaking
the
figure
next
to
her
by
the
sleeve
wake
up
what
had
looked
like
an
old
man
was
a
real
old
man
now
and
he
got
up
and
began
to
gather
sticks
to
make
a
fire
and
to
pick
up
the
little
brown
stones
which
had
been
scattered
about
all
day
but
which
now
were
berries
of
coffee
the
larger
ones
which
you
might
find
here
and
there
were
rasped
rolls
then
the
woman
answered
jack
why
not
why
because
it
full
moon
at
midnight
and
the
moment
the
moon
is
past
the
full
your
queen
whose
country
you
have
just
left
will
be
able
to
cross
over
the
little
stream
and
she
will
want
to
take
you
and
that
other
mortal
back
she
can
do
it
of
course
if
she
pleases
and
we
can
afford
you
no
protection
for
by
that
time
we
shall
be
stones
again
we
are
only
people
two
hours
out
of
the
that
is
very
hard
observed
jack
no
said
the
woman
in
a
tone
of
indifference
it
comes
to
the
same
thing
as
we
live
twelve
times
as
long
as
others
do
by
this
time
the
shepherd
was
gently
driving
his
flock
down
to
the
water
and
round
fifty
little
fires
groups
of
people
were
sitting
roasting
coffee
while
cows
were
lowing
to
be
milked
and
girls
with
distaffs
were
coming
to
them
slowly
for
no
one
was
in
a
hurry
there
they
say
in
that
country
that
they
wish
to
enjoy
their
day
quietly
because
it
is
so
short
can
you
tell
us
anything
of
the
land
beyond
the
mountains
asked
jack
yes
said
the
woman
of
all
fairy
lands
it
is
the
best
the
people
are
the
gentlest
and
kindest
then
i
had
better
take
mopsa
there
than
down
the
river
said
jack
you
ca
take
her
down
the
river
replied
the
woman
and
jack
thought
she
laughed
and
was
glad
of
that
why
not
asked
jack
i
have
a
boat
yes
sir
answered
the
woman
but
where
is
it
now
chapter
xiii
melon
seeds
well
this
is
the
forest
of
arden
ay
now
am
i
in
arden
the
more
fool
i
when
i
was
at
home
i
was
in
a
better
place
but
travellers
must
be
content
you
like
where
is
it
now
said
the
and
when
jack
heard
that
he
ran
down
to
the
river
and
looked
right
and
looked
left
at
last
he
saw
his
boat
a
mere
speck
in
the
distance
it
had
floated
so
far
he
called
it
but
it
was
far
beyond
the
reach
of
his
voice
and
mopsa
who
had
followed
him
said
it
does
not
signify
jack
for
i
feel
that
no
place
is
the
right
place
for
me
but
that
country
beyond
the
purple
mountains
and
i
shall
never
be
happy
unless
we
go
there
so
they
walked
back
towards
the
hand
in
hand
and
the
presently
joined
them
she
was
crying
gently
for
she
knew
that
she
must
soon
pass
over
the
little
stream
and
part
with
these
whom
she
called
her
dear
children
jack
had
often
spoken
to
her
that
day
about
going
home
to
her
own
country
but
she
said
it
was
too
late
to
think
of
that
now
and
she
must
end
her
days
in
the
land
of
faery
the
kind
asked
them
to
come
and
sit
by
their
little
fire
and
in
the
dusk
the
woman
whose
baby
had
slept
in
a
stone
cradle
took
it
up
and
began
to
sing
to
it
she
seemed
astonished
when
she
heard
that
the
had
power
to
go
home
if
she
could
make
up
her
mind
to
do
it
and
as
she
sang
she
looked
at
her
with
wonder
and
pity
little
babe
while
burns
the
west
warm
thee
warm
thee
in
my
breast
while
the
moon
doth
shine
her
best
and
the
dews
distil
not
all
the
land
so
sad
so
fair
sweet
its
toils
are
blest
its
care
child
we
may
not
enter
there
some
there
are
that
will
not
fain
would
i
thy
margins
know
land
of
work
and
land
of
snow
land
of
life
whose
rivers
flow
on
and
on
and
stay
not
fain
would
i
thy
small
limbs
fold
while
the
weary
hours
are
told
little
babe
in
cradle
cold
some
there
are
that
may
not
you
are
not
exactly
fairies
i
suppose
said
jack
if
you
were
you
could
go
to
our
country
when
you
pleased
no
said
the
woman
we
are
not
exactly
fairies
but
we
shall
be
more
like
them
when
our
punishment
is
over
i
am
sorry
you
are
punished
answered
jack
for
you
seem
very
nice
kind
people
we
were
not
always
kind
answered
the
woman
and
perhaps
we
are
only
kind
now
because
we
have
no
time
and
no
chance
of
being
otherwise
i
sure
i
do
know
about
that
we
were
powerful
once
and
we
did
a
cruel
deed
i
must
not
tell
you
what
it
was
we
were
told
that
our
hearts
were
all
as
cold
as
stones
and
i
suppose
they
were
and
we
were
doomed
to
be
stones
all
our
lives
excepting
for
the
two
hours
of
twilight
there
was
no
one
to
sow
the
crops
or
water
the
grass
so
it
all
failed
and
the
trees
died
and
our
houses
fell
and
our
possessions
were
stolen
from
us
it
is
a
very
sad
thing
observed
the
and
then
she
said
that
she
must
go
for
she
had
a
long
way
to
walk
before
she
should
reach
the
little
brook
that
led
to
the
country
of
her
own
queen
so
she
kissed
the
two
children
jack
and
mopsa
and
they
begged
her
again
to
think
better
of
it
and
return
to
her
own
land
but
she
said
no
she
had
no
heart
for
work
now
and
could
not
bear
either
cold
or
poverty
then
the
woman
who
was
hugging
her
little
baby
and
keeping
it
cosy
and
warm
began
to
tell
jack
and
mopsa
that
it
was
time
they
should
begin
to
run
away
to
the
country
over
the
purple
mountains
or
else
the
queen
would
overtake
them
and
be
very
angry
with
them
so
with
many
promises
that
they
would
mind
her
directions
they
set
off
hand
in
hand
to
run
but
before
they
left
her
they
could
see
plainly
that
she
was
beginning
to
turn
again
into
stone
however
she
had
given
them
a
slice
of
melon
with
the
seeds
in
it
it
had
been
growing
on
the
edge
of
the
river
and
was
stone
in
the
like
everything
else
when
you
are
tired
she
said
eat
the
seeds
and
they
will
enable
you
to
go
running
on
you
can
put
the
slice
into
this
little
red
pot
which
has
string
handles
to
it
and
you
can
hang
it
on
your
arm
while
you
have
it
with
you
it
will
not
turn
to
stone
but
if
you
lay
it
down
it
will
and
then
it
will
be
useless
so
as
i
said
before
jack
and
mopsa
set
off
hand
in
hand
to
run
and
as
they
ran
all
the
things
and
people
gradually
and
softly
settled
themselves
to
turn
into
stone
again
their
cloaks
and
gowns
left
off
fluttering
and
hung
stiffly
and
then
they
left
off
their
occupations
and
sat
down
or
laid
down
themselves
and
the
sheep
and
cattle
turned
stiff
and
too
so
that
in
a
very
little
while
all
that
country
was
nothing
but
red
stones
and
red
sand
just
as
it
had
been
in
the
morning
presently
the
full
moon
which
had
been
hiding
behind
a
cloud
came
out
and
they
saw
their
shadows
which
fell
straight
before
them
so
they
ran
on
hand
in
hand
very
merrily
till
the
came
up
and
the
shadows
she
made
them
cast
fell
sideways
this
was
rather
awkward
because
as
long
as
only
the
full
moon
gave
them
shadows
they
had
but
to
follow
them
in
order
to
go
straight
towards
the
purple
mountains
now
they
were
not
always
sure
which
were
her
shadows
and
presently
a
crescent
moon
came
and
still
further
confused
them
also
the
sand
began
to
have
tufts
of
grass
in
it
and
then
when
they
had
gone
a
little
farther
there
were
beautiful
patches
of
anemones
and
hyacinths
and
jonquils
and
crown
imperials
and
they
stopped
to
gather
them
and
they
got
among
some
trees
and
then
as
they
had
nothing
to
guide
them
but
the
shadows
and
these
went
all
sorts
of
ways
they
lost
a
great
deal
of
time
and
the
trees
became
of
taller
growth
but
they
still
ran
on
and
on
till
they
got
into
a
thick
forest
where
it
was
quite
dark
and
here
mopsa
began
to
cry
for
she
was
tired
if
i
could
only
begin
to
be
a
queen
she
said
to
jack
i
could
go
wherever
i
pleased
i
am
not
a
fairy
and
yet
i
am
not
a
proper
queen
oh
what
shall
i
do
i
can
not
go
any
farther
so
jack
gave
her
some
of
the
seeds
of
the
melon
though
it
was
so
dark
that
he
could
scarcely
find
the
way
to
her
mouth
and
then
he
took
some
himself
and
they
both
felt
that
they
were
rested
and
jack
comforted
mopsa
if
you
are
not
a
queen
yet
he
said
you
will
be
by
morning
for
when
our
shadows
danced
on
before
us
yours
was
so
very
nearly
the
same
height
as
mine
that
i
could
hardly
see
any
difference
when
they
reached
the
end
of
that
great
forest
and
found
themselves
out
in
all
sorts
of
moonlight
the
first
thing
they
did
was
to
laugh
the
shadows
looked
so
odd
sticking
out
in
every
direction
and
the
next
thing
they
did
was
to
stand
back
to
back
and
put
their
heels
together
and
touch
their
heads
together
to
see
by
the
shadow
which
was
the
taller
and
jack
was
still
the
least
bit
in
the
world
taller
than
mopsa
so
they
knew
she
was
not
a
queen
yet
and
they
ate
some
more
and
began
to
climb
up
the
mountain
they
climbed
till
the
trees
of
the
forest
looked
no
bigger
than
gooseberry
bushes
and
then
they
climbed
till
the
whole
forest
looked
only
like
a
patch
of
moss
and
then
when
they
got
a
little
higher
they
saw
the
wonderful
river
a
long
way
off
and
the
snow
glittering
on
the
peaks
overhead
and
while
they
were
looking
and
wondering
how
they
should
find
a
pass
the
moons
all
went
down
one
after
the
other
and
if
mopsa
had
not
found
some
glowworms
they
would
have
been
quite
in
the
dark
again
however
she
took
a
dozen
of
them
and
put
them
round
jack
ankles
so
that
when
he
walked
he
could
see
where
he
was
going
and
he
found
a
little
and
she
followed
him
now
they
had
noticed
during
the
night
how
many
kept
darting
about
from
time
to
time
and
at
last
one
shot
close
by
them
and
fell
in
the
soft
moss
on
before
there
it
lay
shining
and
jack
though
he
began
to
feel
very
tired
again
made
haste
to
it
for
he
wanted
to
see
what
it
was
like
it
was
not
what
you
would
have
supposed
it
was
soft
and
round
and
about
the
color
of
a
ripe
apricot
it
was
covered
with
fur
and
in
fact
it
was
evidently
alive
and
had
curled
itself
up
into
a
round
ball
the
dear
little
thing
said
jack
as
he
held
it
in
his
hand
and
showed
it
to
mopsa
how
its
heart
beats
is
it
frightened
who
are
you
said
mopsa
to
the
thing
what
is
your
name
the
little
creature
made
a
sound
that
seemed
like
wisp
uncurl
yourself
wisp
said
mopsa
jack
and
i
want
to
look
at
you
so
wisp
unfolded
himself
and
showed
two
little
black
eyes
and
spread
out
two
long
filmy
wings
he
was
like
a
most
beautiful
bat
and
the
light
he
shed
out
illuminated
their
faces
it
is
only
one
of
the
air
fairies
said
mopsa
pretty
creature
it
never
did
any
harm
and
would
like
to
do
us
good
if
it
knew
how
for
it
knows
that
i
shall
be
a
queen
very
soon
wisp
if
you
like
you
may
go
and
tell
your
friends
and
relations
that
we
want
to
cross
over
the
mountains
and
if
they
can
they
may
help
us
upon
this
wisp
spread
out
his
wings
and
shot
off
again
and
feet
were
so
tired
that
he
sat
down
and
pulled
off
one
of
his
shoes
for
he
thought
there
was
a
stone
in
it
so
he
set
the
little
red
jar
beside
him
and
quite
forgot
what
the
had
said
but
went
on
shaking
his
shoe
and
buckling
it
and
admiring
the
glowworms
round
his
ankle
till
mopsa
said
darling
jack
i
am
so
dreadfully
tired
give
me
some
more
then
he
lifted
up
the
jar
and
thought
it
felt
very
heavy
and
when
he
put
in
his
hand
jar
and
melon
and
seeds
were
all
turned
to
stone
together
they
were
both
very
sorry
and
they
sat
still
for
a
minute
or
two
for
they
were
much
too
tired
to
stir
and
then
began
to
appear
in
all
directions
the
fairy
bat
had
told
his
friends
and
relations
and
they
were
coming
one
fell
at
mopsa
feet
another
in
her
lap
more
more
all
about
behind
before
and
over
them
and
they
spread
out
long
filmy
wings
some
of
them
a
yard
long
till
jack
and
mopsa
seemed
to
be
enclosed
in
a
perfect
network
of
the
rays
of
and
they
were
both
a
good
deal
frightened
fifty
or
sixty
with
black
eyes
that
could
stare
were
enough
they
thought
to
frighten
anybody
if
we
had
anything
to
sit
upon
said
mopsa
they
could
carry
us
over
the
pass
she
had
no
sooner
spoken
than
the
largest
of
the
bats
bit
off
one
of
his
own
long
wings
and
laid
it
at
mopsa
feet
it
did
not
seem
to
matter
much
to
him
that
he
had
parted
with
it
for
he
shot
out
another
wing
directly
just
as
a
comet
shoots
out
a
ray
of
light
sometimes
when
it
approaches
the
sun
mopsa
thanked
the
shooting
fairy
and
taking
the
wing
began
to
stretch
it
till
it
was
large
enough
for
her
and
jack
to
sit
upon
then
all
the
shooting
fairies
came
round
it
took
its
edges
in
their
mouths
and
began
to
fly
away
with
it
over
the
mountains
they
went
slowly
for
jack
and
mopsa
were
heavy
and
they
flew
very
low
resting
now
and
then
but
in
the
course
of
time
they
carried
the
wing
over
the
pass
and
halfway
down
the
other
side
then
the
sun
came
up
and
the
moment
he
appeared
all
their
lovely
light
was
gone
and
they
only
looked
like
common
bats
such
as
you
can
see
every
evening
they
set
down
jack
and
mopsa
folded
up
their
long
wings
and
hung
down
their
heads
mopsa
thanked
them
and
said
they
had
been
useful
but
still
they
looked
ashamed
and
crept
into
little
corners
and
crevices
of
the
rock
to
hide

walter
scott
there
were
many
on
that
slope
of
the
mountain
and
jack
and
mopsa
as
they
came
down
gathered
some
fruit
for
breakfast
and
did
not
feel
very
tired
for
the
long
ride
on
the
wing
had
rested
them
they
could
not
see
the
plain
for
a
slight
blue
mist
hung
over
it
but
the
sun
was
hot
already
and
as
they
came
down
they
saw
a
beautiful
bed
of
high
reeds
and
thought
they
would
sit
awhile
and
rest
in
it
a
rill
of
clear
water
ran
beside
the
bed
so
when
they
had
reached
it
they
sat
down
and
began
to
consider
what
they
should
do
next
jack
said
mopsa
did
you
see
anything
particular
as
you
came
down
with
the
no
i
saw
nothing
so
interesting
as
they
were
answered
jack
i
was
looking
at
them
and
watching
how
they
squeaked
to
one
another
and
how
they
had
little
hooks
in
their
wings
with
which
they
held
the
large
wing
that
we
sat
on
but
i
saw
something
said
mopsa
just
as
the
sun
rose
i
looked
down
and
in
the
loveliest
garden
i
ever
saw
and
all
among
trees
and
woods
i
saw
a
most
beautiful
castle
o
jack
i
am
sure
that
castle
is
the
place
i
am
to
live
in
and
now
we
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
find
it
i
shall
soon
be
a
queen
and
there
i
shall
reign
then
i
shall
be
king
there
said
jack
shall
i
yes
if
you
can
answered
mopsa
of
course
whatever
you
can
do
you
may
do
and
jack
this
is
a
much
better
fairy
country
than
either
the
stony
land
or
the
other
that
we
first
came
to
for
this
castle
is
a
real
place
it
will
not
melt
away
there
the
people
can
work
they
know
how
to
love
each
other
common
fairies
can
not
do
that
i
know
they
can
laugh
and
cry
and
i
shall
teach
them
several
things
that
they
do
not
know
yet
oh
do
let
us
make
haste
and
find
the
castle
so
they
arose
but
they
turned
the
wrong
way
and
by
mistake
walked
farther
and
farther
in
among
the
reeds
whose
feathery
heads
puffed
into
mopsa
face
and
jack
coat
was
all
covered
with
the
fluffy
seed
this
is
very
odd
said
jack
i
thought
this
was
only
a
small
bed
of
reeds
when
we
stepped
into
it
but
really
we
must
have
walked
a
mile
already
but
they
walked
on
and
on
till
mopsa
grew
quite
faint
and
her
sweet
face
became
very
pale
for
she
knew
that
the
beds
of
reeds
were
spreading
faster
than
they
walked
and
then
they
shot
up
so
high
that
it
was
impossible
to
see
over
their
heads
so
at
last
jack
and
mopsa
were
so
tired
that
they
sat
down
and
mopsa
began
to
cry
however
jack
was
the
braver
of
the
two
this
time
and
he
comforted
mopsa
and
told
her
that
she
was
nearly
a
queen
and
would
never
reach
her
castle
by
sitting
still
so
she
got
up
and
took
his
hand
and
he
went
on
before
parting
the
reeds
and
pulling
her
after
him
till
all
on
a
sudden
they
heard
the
sweetest
sound
in
the
world
it
was
like
a
bell
and
it
sounded
again
and
again
it
was
the
castle
clock
and
it
was
striking
twelve
at
noon
as
it
finished
striking
they
came
out
at
the
farther
edge
of
the
great
bed
of
reeds
and
there
was
the
castle
straight
before
them
a
beautiful
castle
standing
on
the
slope
of
a
hill
the
grass
all
about
it
was
covered
with
beautiful
flowers
two
of
the
taller
turrets
were
overgrown
with
ivy
and
a
flag
was
flying
on
a
staff
but
everything
was
so
silent
and
lonely
that
it
made
one
sad
to
look
on
as
jack
and
mopsa
drew
near
they
trod
as
gently
as
they
could
and
did
not
say
a
word
all
the
windows
were
shut
but
there
was
a
great
door
in
the
centre
of
the
building
and
they
went
towards
it
hand
in
hand
what
a
beautiful
hall
the
great
door
stood
wide
open
and
they
could
see
what
a
delightful
place
this
must
be
to
live
in
it
was
paved
with
squares
of
blue
and
white
marble
and
here
and
there
carpets
were
spread
with
chairs
and
tables
upon
them
they
looked
and
saw
a
great
dome
overhead
filled
with
windows
of
colored
glass
and
they
cast
down
blue
and
golden
and
rosy
reflections
there
is
my
home
that
i
shall
live
in
said
mopsa
and
she
came
close
to
the
door
and
they
both
looked
in
till
at
last
she
let
go
of
jack
hand
and
stepped
over
the
threshold
the
bell
in
the
tower
sounded
again
more
sweetly
than
ever
and
the
instant
mopsa
was
inside
there
came
from
behind
the
fluted
columns
which
rose
up
on
every
side
the
brown
doe
followed
by
troops
of
deer
and
fawns
mopsa
mopsa
cried
jack
come
away
come
back
but
mopsa
was
too
much
astonished
to
stir
and
something
seemed
to
hold
jack
from
following
but
he
looked
and
looked
till
as
the
brown
doe
advanced
the
door
of
the
castle
closed
mopsa
was
shut
in
and
jack
was
left
outside
so
mopsa
had
come
straight
to
the
place
she
thought
she
had
ran
away
from
but
i
am
determined
to
get
her
away
from
those
creatures
thought
jack
she
does
not
want
to
reign
over
deer
and
he
began
to
look
about
him
hoping
to
get
in
it
was
of
no
use
all
the
windows
in
that
front
of
the
castle
were
high
and
when
he
tried
to
go
round
he
came
to
a
high
wall
with
battlements
against
some
parts
of
this
wall
the
ivy
grew
and
looked
as
if
it
might
have
grown
there
for
ages
its
stems
were
thicker
than
his
waist
and
its
branches
were
spread
over
the
surface
like
network
so
by
means
of
them
he
hoped
to
climb
to
the
top
he
immediately
began
to
try
oh
how
high
the
wall
was
first
he
came
to
several
sparrows
nests
and
very
much
frightened
the
sparrows
were
then
he
reached
starlings
nests
and
very
angry
the
starlings
were
but
at
last
just
under
the
coping
he
came
to
jackdaws
nests
and
these
birds
were
very
friendly
and
pointed
out
to
him
the
best
little
holes
for
him
to
put
his
feet
into
at
last
he
reached
the
top
and
found
to
his
delight
that
the
wall
was
three
feet
thick
and
he
could
walk
upon
it
quite
comfortably
and
look
down
into
a
lovely
garden
where
all
the
trees
were
in
blossom
and
creepers
tossed
their
long
tendrils
from
tree
to
tree
covered
with
puffs
of
yellow
or
bells
of
white
or
bunches
and
knots
of
blue
or
rosy
bloom
he
could
look
down
into
the
beautiful
empty
rooms
of
the
castle
and
he
walked
cautiously
on
the
wall
till
he
came
to
the
west
front
and
reached
a
little
casement
window
that
had
latticed
panes
jack
peeped
in
nobody
was
there
he
took
his
knife
and
cut
away
a
little
bit
of
lead
to
let
out
the
pane
and
it
fell
with
such
a
crash
on
the
pavement
below
that
he
wondered
it
did
not
bring
the
deer
over
to
look
at
what
he
was
about
nobody
came
he
put
in
his
hand
and
opened
the
latchet
and
with
very
little
trouble
got
down
into
the
room
still
nobody
was
to
be
seen
he
thought
that
the
room
years
ago
might
have
been
a
for
it
was
strewn
with
books
slates
and
all
sorts
of
copybooks
a
fine
soft
dust
had
settled
down
over
everything
pens
papers
and
all
jack
opened
a
copybook
its
pages
were
headed
with
maxims
just
as
ours
are
which
proved
that
these
fairies
must
have
been
superior
to
such
as
he
had
hitherto
come
among
jack
read
some
of
them
turn
your
back
on
the
light
and
you
follow
a
shadow
the
deaf
queen
fate
has
dumb
courtiers
if
the
hound
is
your
foe
do
sleep
in
his
kennel
that
that
is
is
and
so
on
but
nobody
came
and
no
sound
was
heard
so
he
opened
the
door
and
found
himself
in
a
long
and
most
splendid
gallery
all
hung
with
pictures
and
spread
with
a
most
beautiful
carpet
which
was
as
soft
and
white
as
a
piece
of
wool
and
wrought
with
a
beautiful
device
this
was
the
letter
m
with
a
crown
and
sceptre
and
underneath
a
beautiful
little
boat
exactly
like
the
one
in
which
he
had
come
up
the
river
jack
felt
sure
that
this
carpet
had
been
made
for
mopsa
and
he
went
along
the
gallery
upon
it
till
he
reached
a
grand
staircase
of
oak
that
was
almost
black
with
age
and
he
stole
gently
down
it
for
he
began
to
feel
rather
shy
more
especially
as
he
could
now
see
the
great
hall
under
the
dome
and
that
it
had
a
beautiful
lady
in
it
and
many
other
people
but
no
deer
at
all
these
fairy
people
were
something
like
the
fairies
but
much
larger
and
more
like
children
and
they
had
very
gentle
happy
faces
and
seemed
to
be
extremely
glad
and
gay
but
seated
on
a
couch
where
lovely
painted
windows
threw
down
all
sorts
of
rainbow
colors
on
her
was
a
beautiful
fairy
lady
as
large
as
a
woman
she
had
mopsa
in
her
arms
and
was
looking
down
upon
her
with
eyes
full
of
love
while
at
her
side
stood
a
boy
who
was
exactly
and
precisely
like
jack
himself
he
had
rather
long
light
hair
and
gray
eyes
and
a
velvet
jacket
that
was
all
jack
could
see
at
first
but
as
he
drew
nearer
the
boy
turned
and
then
jack
felt
as
if
he
was
looking
at
himself
in
the
glass
mopsa
had
been
very
tired
and
now
she
was
fast
asleep
with
her
head
on
that
lady
shoulder
the
boy
kept
looking
at
her
and
he
seemed
very
happy
indeed
so
did
the
lady
and
she
presently
told
him
to
bring
jack
something
to
eat
it
was
rather
a
curious
speech
that
she
made
to
him
it
was
this
jack
bring
jack
some
breakfast
what
thought
jack
to
himself
has
he
got
a
face
like
mine
and
a
name
like
mine
too
so
that
other
jack
went
away
and
presently
came
back
with
a
golden
plate
full
of
nice
things
to
eat
i
know
you
do
like
me
he
said
as
he
came
up
to
jack
with
the
plate
not
like
him
repeated
the
lady
and
pray
what
reason
have
you
for
not
liking
my
royal
nephew
o
dame
exclaimed
the
boy
and
laughed
the
lady
on
hearing
this
turned
pale
for
she
perceived
that
she
herself
had
mistaken
the
one
for
the
other
i
see
you
know
how
to
laugh
said
the
real
jack
you
are
wiser
people
than
those
whom
i
went
to
first
but
the
reason
i
do
like
you
is
that
you
are
so
exactly
like
me
i
am
not
exclaimed
the
boy
only
hear
him
dame
you
mean
i
suppose
that
you
are
so
exactly
like
me
i
am
sure
i
do
know
what
you
mean
by
it
nor
i
either
replied
jack
almost
in
a
passion
it
could
be
helped
of
course
said
the
other
jack
hush
hush
said
the
fairy
woman
do
wake
our
dear
little
queen
was
it
you
my
royal
nephew
who
spoke
last
yes
dame
answered
the
boy
and
again
he
offered
the
plate
but
jack
was
swelling
with
indignation
and
he
gave
the
plate
a
push
with
his
elbow
which
scattered
the
fruit
and
bread
on
the
ground
i
wo
eat
it
he
said
but
when
the
other
jack
went
and
picked
it
up
again
and
said
oh
yes
do
old
fellow
it
not
my
fault
you
know
he
began
to
consider
that
it
was
no
use
being
cross
in
fairyland
so
he
forgave
his
double
and
had
just
finished
his
breakfast
when
mopsa
woke
chapter
xv
the
queen
wand
one
two
three
four
one
two
three
four
is
still
one
two
three
four
mellow
and
silvery
are
the
tones
but
i
wish
the
bells
were
more
southey
mopsa
woke
she
was
rather
too
big
to
be
nursed
for
she
was
the
size
of
jack
and
looked
like
a
sweet
little
girl
of
ten
years
but
she
did
not
always
behave
like
one
sometimes
she
spoke
as
wisely
as
a
woman
and
sometimes
she
changed
again
and
seemed
like
a
child
mopsa
lifted
up
her
head
and
pushed
back
her
long
hair
her
coronet
had
fallen
off
while
she
was
in
the
bed
of
reeds
and
she
said
to
the
beautiful
dame
i
am
a
queen
now
yes
my
sweet
queen
answered
the
lady
i
know
you
are
and
you
promise
that
you
will
be
kind
to
me
till
i
grow
up
said
mopsa
and
love
me
and
teach
me
how
to
reign
yes
repeated
the
lady
and
i
will
love
you
too
just
as
if
you
were
a
mortal
and
i
your
mother
for
i
am
only
ten
years
old
yet
said
mopsa
and
the
throne
is
too
big
for
me
to
sit
upon
but
i
am
a
queen
and
then
she
paused
and
said
is
it
three
as
she
spoke
the
sweet
clear
bell
of
the
castle
sounded
three
times
and
then
chimes
began
to
play
they
played
such
a
joyous
tune
that
it
made
everybody
sing
the
dame
sang
the
crowd
of
fairies
sang
the
boy
who
was
jack
double
sang
and
mopsa
sang
only
jack
was
silent
and
this
was
the
song
the
prince
shall
to
the
chase
again
the
dame
has
got
her
face
again
the
king
shall
have
his
place
again
aneath
the
fairy
dome
and
all
the
knights
shall
woo
again
and
all
the
doves
shall
coo
again
and
all
the
dreams
come
true
again
and
jack
shall
go
home
we
shall
see
about
that
thought
jack
to
himself
and
mopsa
while
she
sang
those
last
words
burst
into
tears
which
jack
did
not
like
to
see
but
all
the
fairies
were
so
very
glad
so
joyous
and
so
delighted
with
her
for
having
come
to
be
their
queen
that
after
a
while
she
dried
her
eyes
and
said
to
the
wrong
boy
jack
when
i
pulled
the
lining
out
of
your
there
was
a
silver
fourpence
in
it
yes
said
the
real
jack
and
here
it
is
is
it
real
money
asked
mopsa
are
you
sure
you
brought
it
with
you
all
the
way
from
your
own
country
yes
said
jack
quite
sure
then
dear
jack
answered
mopsa
will
you
give
it
to
me
i
will
said
jack
if
you
will
send
this
boy
away
how
can
i
answered
mopsa
surprised
do
you
know
what
happened
when
the
door
closed
has
nobody
told
you
i
did
not
see
any
one
after
i
got
into
the
place
said
jack
there
was
no
one
to
tell
anything
not
even
a
fawn
nor
the
brown
doe
i
have
only
seen
down
here
these
fairy
people
and
this
boy
and
this
lady
the
lady
is
the
brown
doe
answered
mopsa
and
this
boy
and
the
fairies
were
the
fawns
jack
was
so
astonished
at
this
that
he
stared
at
the
lady
and
the
boy
and
the
fairies
with
all
his
might
the
sun
came
shining
in
as
i
stepped
inside
said
mopsa
and
a
long
beam
fell
down
from
the
fairy
dome
across
my
feet
do
you
remember
what
the
told
us
how
it
was
reported
that
the
brown
doe
and
her
nation
had
a
queen
whom
they
shut
up
and
never
let
the
sun
shine
on
her
that
was
not
a
kind
or
true
report
and
yet
it
came
from
something
that
really
happened
yes
i
remember
said
jack
and
if
the
sun
did
shine
they
were
all
to
be
turned
into
deer
i
dare
not
tell
you
all
that
story
yet
said
mopsa
but
jack
as
the
brown
doe
and
all
the
fawns
came
up
to
greet
me
and
passed
by
turns
into
the
sunbeam
they
took
their
own
forms
every
one
of
them
because
the
spell
was
broken
they
were
to
remain
in
the
disguise
of
deer
till
a
queen
of
alien
birth
should
come
to
them
against
her
will
i
am
a
queen
of
alien
birth
and
did
not
i
come
against
my
will
yes
to
be
sure
answered
jack
we
thought
all
the
time
that
we
were
running
away
if
ever
you
come
to
fairyland
again
observed
mopsa
you
can
save
yourself
the
trouble
of
trying
to
run
away
from
the
old
mother
i
shall
not
answered
jack
because
i
shall
not
go
not
for
a
long
while
at
least
but
the
boy
i
want
to
know
why
this
boy
turned
into
another
me
because
he
is
the
heir
of
course
answered
mopsa
but
i
do
see
that
this
is
any
reason
at
all
said
jack
mopsa
laughed
that
because
you
do
know
how
to
argue
she
replied
why
the
thing
is
as
plain
as
possible
it
may
be
plain
to
you
persisted
jack
but
it
no
reason
no
reason
repeated
mopsa
no
reason
when
i
like
you
the
best
of
anything
in
the
world
and
when
i
am
come
here
to
be
queen
of
course
when
the
spell
was
broken
he
took
exactly
your
form
on
that
account
and
very
right
too
but
why
asked
jack
mopsa
however
was
like
other
fairies
in
this
respect
that
she
knew
all
about
old
mother
fate
but
not
about
causes
and
reasons
she
believed
as
we
do
in
this
world
that
that
that
is
is
but
the
fairies
go
further
than
this
they
say
that
that
is
is
and
when
it
is
that
is
the
reason
that
it
is
this
sounds
like
nonsense
to
us
but
it
is
all
right
to
them
so
mopsa
thinking
she
had
explained
everything
said
again
and
dear
jack
will
you
give
the
silver
fourpence
to
me
jack
took
it
out
and
she
got
down
from
the
dame
knee
and
took
it
in
the
palm
of
her
hand
laying
the
other
palm
upon
it
it
will
be
very
hot
observed
the
dame
but
it
will
not
burn
me
so
as
really
to
hurt
if
i
am
a
real
queen
said
mopsa
presently
she
began
to
look
as
if
something
gave
her
pain
oh
it
so
hot
she
said
to
the
other
jack
so
very
hot
never
mind
sweet
queen
he
answered
it
will
not
hurt
you
long
remember
my
poor
uncle
and
all
his
knights
mopsa
still
held
the
little
silver
coin
but
jack
saw
that
it
hurt
her
for
two
bright
tears
fell
from
her
eyes
and
in
another
moment
he
saw
that
it
was
actually
melted
for
it
fell
in
glittering
drops
from
mopsa
hand
to
the
marble
floor
and
there
it
lay
as
soft
as
quicksilver
pick
it
up
said
mopsa
to
the
other
jack
and
he
instantly
did
so
and
laid
it
in
her
hand
again
and
she
began
gently
to
roll
it
backwards
and
forwards
between
her
palms
till
she
had
rolled
it
into
a
very
slender
rod
two
feet
long
and
not
nearly
so
thick
as
a
pin
but
it
did
not
bend
and
it
shone
so
brightly
that
you
could
hardly
look
at
it
then
she
held
it
out
towards
the
real
jack
and
said
give
this
a
name
i
think
it
is
a
began
the
other
jack
but
the
dame
suddenly
stopped
him
silence
sire
do
you
know
that
what
it
is
first
called
that
it
will
be
jack
hesitated
he
thought
if
mopsa
was
a
queen
the
thing
ought
to
be
a
sceptre
but
it
certainly
was
not
at
all
like
a
sceptre
that
thing
is
a
wand
said
he
you
are
a
wand
said
mopsa
speaking
to
the
silver
stick
which
was
glittering
now
in
a
sunbeam
almost
as
if
it
were
a
beam
of
light
itself
then
she
spoke
again
to
jack
tell
me
jack
what
can
i
do
with
a
wand
again
the
began
to
speak
and
the
dame
stopped
him
and
again
jack
considered
he
had
heard
a
great
deal
in
his
own
country
about
fairy
wands
but
he
could
not
remember
that
the
fairies
had
done
anything
particular
with
them
so
he
gave
what
he
thought
was
true
but
what
seemed
to
him
a
very
stupid
answer
you
can
make
it
point
to
anything
that
you
please
the
moment
he
had
said
this
shouts
of
ecstasy
filled
the
hall
and
all
the
fairies
clapped
their
hands
with
such
hurrahs
of
delight
that
he
blushed
for
joy
the
dame
also
looked
truly
glad
and
as
for
the
other
jack
he
actually
turned
head
over
heels
just
as
jack
had
often
done
himself
on
his
father
lawn
jack
had
merely
meant
that
mopsa
could
point
with
the
wand
to
anything
that
she
saw
but
he
was
presently
told
that
what
he
had
meant
was
nothing
and
that
his
words
were
everything
i
can
make
it
point
now
said
mopsa
and
it
will
point
aright
to
anything
i
please
whether
i
know
where
the
thing
is
or
not
again
the
hall
was
filled
with
those
cries
of
joy
and
the
sweet
fairies
congratulated
each
other
with
the
queen
has
got
a
wand
a
wand
and
she
can
make
it
point
wherever
she
pleases
then
mopsa
rose
and
walked
towards
the
beautiful
staircase
the
dame
and
all
the
fairies
following
jack
was
going
too
but
the
other
jack
held
him
where
is
mopsa
going
and
why
am
i
not
to
follow
inquired
jack
they
are
going
to
put
on
her
robes
of
course
answered
the
other
jack
i
am
so
tired
of
always
hearing
you
say
course
answered
jack
and
i
wonder
how
it
is
that
you
always
seem
to
know
what
is
going
to
be
done
without
being
told
however
i
suppose
you
ca
help
being
odd
people
the
did
not
make
a
direct
answer
he
only
said
i
like
you
very
much
though
you
do
like
me
why
do
you
like
me
asked
jack
so
he
opened
his
eyes
wide
with
surprise
most
boys
say
sire
to
me
he
observed
at
least
they
used
to
do
when
there
were
any
boys
here
however
that
does
not
signify
why
of
course
i
like
you
because
i
am
so
tired
of
being
always
a
fawn
and
you
brought
mopsa
to
break
the
spell
you
can
not
think
how
disagreeable
it
is
to
have
no
hands
and
to
be
all
covered
with
hair
now
look
at
my
hands
i
can
move
them
and
turn
them
everywhere
even
over
my
head
if
i
like
hoofs
are
good
for
nothing
in
comparison
and
we
could
not
talk
do
tell
me
about
it
said
jack
how
did
you
become
fawns
i
dare
not
tell
you
said
the
boy
and
listen
i
hear
mopsa
jack
looked
and
certainly
mopsa
was
coming
but
very
strangely
he
thought
mopsa
like
all
other
fairies
was
afraid
to
whisper
a
spell
with
her
eyes
open
so
a
handkerchief
was
tied
across
them
and
as
she
came
on
she
felt
her
way
holding
by
the
banisters
with
one
hand
and
with
the
other
between
her
finger
and
thumb
holding
out
the
silver
wand
she
felt
with
her
foot
for
the
edge
of
the
first
stair
and
jack
heard
her
say
i
am
much
older
ah
so
much
older
now
i
have
got
my
wand
i
can
feel
sorrow
too
and
sorrow
weighs
down
my
heart
mopsa
was
dressed
superbly
in
a
white
satin
gown
with
a
long
long
train
of
crimson
velvet
which
was
glittering
with
diamonds
it
reached
almost
from
one
end
of
the
great
gallery
to
the
other
and
had
hundreds
of
fairies
to
hold
it
and
keep
it
in
its
place
but
in
her
hair
were
no
jewels
only
a
little
crown
made
of
daisies
and
on
her
shoulders
her
robe
was
fastened
with
the
little
golden
image
of
a
boat
these
things
were
to
show
the
land
she
had
come
from
and
the
vessel
she
had
come
in
so
she
came
slowly
slowly
down
stairs
blindfold
and
muttering
to
her
wand
all
the
time
though
the
sun
shine
brightly
wand
wand
guide
rightly
so
she
felt
her
way
down
to
the
great
hall
there
the
wand
turned
half
round
in
the
hall
toward
the
great
door
and
she
and
jack
and
the
other
jack
came
out
into
the
lawn
in
front
with
all
the
followers
and
trainbearers
only
the
dame
remained
behind
jack
noticed
now
for
the
first
time
that
with
the
one
exception
of
the
all
these
fairies
were
he
also
observed
that
mopsa
after
the
manner
of
fairy
queens
though
she
moved
slowly
and
blindfold
was
beginning
to
tell
a
story
this
time
it
did
not
make
him
feel
sleepy
it
did
not
begin
at
the
beginning
their
stories
never
do
these
are
the
first
words
he
heard
for
she
spoke
softly
and
very
low
while
he
walked
at
her
right
hand
and
the
other
jack
on
her
left
and
so
now
i
have
no
wings
but
my
thoughts
can
go
up
jovinian
and
roxaletta
could
not
think
my
thoughts
are
instead
of
wings
but
they
have
dropped
with
me
now
as
a
lark
among
the
clods
of
the
valley
wand
do
you
bend
yes
i
am
following
wand
and
after
that
the
bird
said
will
come
when
you
call
me
i
never
have
seen
her
moving
overhead
perhaps
she
is
out
of
sight
flocks
of
birds
hover
over
the
world
and
watch
it
high
up
where
the
air
is
thin
there
are
zones
but
those
in
the
lowest
zone
are
far
out
of
sight
i
have
not
been
up
there
i
have
no
wings
over
the
highest
of
the
birds
is
the
place
where
angels
float
and
gather
the
children
souls
as
they
are
set
free
and
so
that
woman
told
me
wand
you
bend
again
and
i
will
turn
at
your
bending
that
woman
told
me
how
it
was
for
when
the
new
king
was
born
a
black
fairy
with
a
smiling
face
came
and
sat
within
the
doorway
she
had
a
spindle
and
would
always
spin
she
wanted
to
teach
them
how
to
spin
but
they
did
not
like
her
and
they
loved
to
do
nothing
at
all
so
they
turned
her
out
but
after
her
came
a
brown
fairy
with
a
grave
face
and
she
sat
on
the
black
fairy
stool
and
gave
them
much
counsel
they
liked
that
still
less
so
they
got
spindles
and
spun
for
they
said
will
go
now
and
we
shall
have
the
black
fairy
again
when
she
did
not
go
they
turned
her
out
also
and
after
her
came
a
white
fairy
and
sat
in
the
same
seat
she
did
nothing
at
all
and
she
said
nothing
at
all
but
she
had
a
sorrowful
face
and
she
looked
up
so
they
were
displeased
they
turned
her
out
also
and
she
went
and
sat
by
the
edge
of
the
lake
with
her
two
sisters
and
everything
prospered
over
all
the
land
till
after
the
shepherds
because
the
king
was
a
child
came
to
his
uncle
and
said
what
shall
we
do
with
the
old
wool
for
the
new
fleeces
are
in
the
bales
and
there
is
no
storehouse
to
put
them
in
so
he
said
them
into
the
lake
and
while
they
threw
them
in
a
great
flock
of
finches
flew
to
them
and
said
us
some
of
the
wool
that
you
do
not
want
we
should
be
glad
of
it
to
build
our
nests
with
they
answered
and
gather
for
yourselves
there
is
wool
on
every
thorn
then
the
black
fairy
said
shall
be
forgiven
this
time
because
the
birds
should
pick
wool
for
themselves
so
the
finches
flew
away
then
the
harvest
was
over
and
the
reapers
came
and
said
to
the
uncle
what
shall
we
do
with
the
new
wheat
for
the
old
is
not
half
eaten
yet
and
there
is
no
room
in
the
granaries
he
said
that
into
the
lake
also
while
they
were
throwing
it
in
there
came
a
great
flight
of
the
wood
fairies
fairies
of
passage
from
over
the
sea
they
were
in
the
form
of
pigeons
and
they
alighted
and
prayed
them
cousins
we
are
faint
with
our
long
flight
give
us
some
of
that
corn
which
you
do
not
want
that
we
may
peck
it
and
be
refreshed
but
they
said
may
rest
on
our
land
but
our
corn
is
our
own
rest
awhile
and
go
and
get
food
in
your
own
fields
then
the
brown
fairy
said
may
be
forgiven
this
once
but
yet
it
is
a
great
unkindness
and
as
they
were
going
to
pour
in
the
last
sackful
there
passed
a
poor
mortal
beggar
who
had
strayed
in
from
the
men
and
women
world
and
she
said
give
me
some
of
that
wheat
o
fairy
people
for
i
am
hungry
i
have
lost
my
way
and
there
is
no
money
to
be
earned
here
give
me
some
of
that
wheat
that
i
may
bake
cakes
lest
i
and
my
baby
should
starve
and
they
said
is
starve
we
never
heard
that
word
before
and
we
can
not
wait
while
you
explain
it
to
us
so
they
poured
it
all
into
the
lake
and
then
the
white
fairy
said
can
not
be
forgiven
them
and
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
wept
then
the
black
fairy
rose
and
drove
them
all
before
her
the
prince
with
his
chief
shepherd
and
his
reapers
his
courtiers
and
his
knights
she
drove
them
into
the
great
bed
of
reeds
and
no
one
has
ever
set
eyes
on
them
since
then
the
brown
fairy
went
into
the
palace
where
the
king
aunt
sat
with
all
her
ladies
and
her
maids
about
her
and
with
the
on
her
knee
it
was
a
very
gloomy
day
she
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
hall
and
said
you
and
most
unkind
my
spell
is
upon
you
and
the
first
ray
of
sunshine
shall
bring
it
down
lose
your
present
forms
and
be
of
a
more
gentle
and
innocent
race
till
a
queen
of
alien
birth
shall
come
to
reign
over
you
against
her
will
as
she
spoke
they
crept
into
corners
and
covered
the
dame
head
with
a
veil
and
all
that
day
it
was
dark
and
gloomy
and
nothing
happened
and
all
the
next
day
it
rained
and
rained
and
they
thrust
the
dame
into
a
dark
closet
and
kept
her
there
for
a
whole
month
and
still
not
a
ray
of
sunshine
came
to
do
them
any
damage
but
the
dame
faded
and
faded
in
the
dark
and
at
last
they
said
must
come
out
or
she
will
die
and
we
do
not
believe
the
sun
will
ever
shine
in
our
country
any
more
so
they
let
the
poor
dame
come
out
and
lo
as
she
crept
slowly
forth
under
the
dome
a
piercing
ray
of
sunlight
darted
down
upon
her
head
and
in
an
instant
they
were
all
changed
into
deer
and
the
too
they
are
gentle
now
and
kind
but
where
is
the
prince
where
are
the
fairy
knights
and
the
fairy
men
wand
why
do
you
turn
now
while
mopsa
told
her
story
the
wand
continued
to
bend
and
mopsa
following
was
slowly
approaching
the
foot
of
a
great
precipice
which
rose
sheer
up
for
more
than
a
hundred
feet
the
crowd
that
followed
looked
dismayed
at
this
they
thought
the
wand
must
be
wrong
or
even
if
it
was
right
they
could
not
climb
a
precipice
but
still
mopsa
walked
on
blindfold
and
the
wand
pointed
at
the
rock
till
it
touched
it
and
she
said
who
is
stopping
me
they
told
her
and
she
called
to
some
of
her
ladies
to
untie
the
handkerchief
then
mopsa
looked
at
the
rock
and
so
did
the
two
jacks
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
but
a
very
tiny
hole
the
thought
it
led
to
a
bees
nest
and
jack
thought
it
was
a
keyhole
for
he
noticed
in
the
rock
a
slight
crack
which
took
the
shape
of
an
arched
door
mopsa
looked
earnestly
at
the
hole
it
may
be
a
keyhole
she
said
but
there
is
no
key
chapter

failure
we
are
much
bound
to
them
that
do
succeed
but
in
a
more
pathetic
sense
are
bound
to
such
as
fail
they
all
our
loss
expound
they
comfort
us
for
work
that
will
not
speed
and
life
itself
a
failure
ay
his
deed
sweetest
in
story
who
the
dusk
profound
of
hades
flooded
with
entrancing
sound
music
own
tears
was
failure
doth
it
read
therefore
the
worse
ah
no
so
much
to
dare
he
fronts
the
regnant
darkness
on
its
so
much
to
do
impetuous
even
there
he
pours
out
love
disconsolate
sweet
moan
he
wins
but
few
for
that
his
deed
recall
its
power
is
in
the
look
which
costs
him
all
at
this
moment
jack
observed
that
a
strange
woman
was
standing
among
them
and
that
the
trainbearing
fairies
fell
back
as
if
they
were
afraid
of
her
as
no
one
spoke
he
did
and
said
she
answered
correcting
him
i
am
the
black
fairy
work
is
a
fine
thing
most
people
in
your
country
can
work
yes
said
jack
there
are
two
spades
continued
the
fairy
woman
one
for
you
and
one
for
your
double
jack
took
one
of
the
spades
it
was
small
and
was
made
of
silver
but
the
other
jack
said
with
scorn
i
shall
be
a
king
when
i
am
old
enough
and
must
i
dig
like
a
clown
as
you
please
said
the
black
fairy
and
walked
away
then
they
all
observed
that
a
brown
woman
was
standing
there
and
she
stepped
up
and
whispered
in
the
ear
as
he
listened
his
sullen
face
became
good
tempered
and
at
last
he
said
in
a
gentle
tone
jack
i
quite
ready
to
begin
if
you
are
but
where
are
we
to
dig
asked
jack
there
said
a
white
fairy
stepping
up
and
setting
her
foot
on
the
grass
just
under
the
little
hole
dig
down
as
deep
as
you
can
so
mopsa
and
the
crowd
stood
back
and
the
two
boys
began
to
dig
and
greatly
they
enjoyed
it
for
people
can
dig
so
fast
in
fairyland
very
soon
the
hole
was
so
deep
that
they
had
to
jump
into
it
because
they
could
not
reach
the
bottom
with
their
spades
this
is
very
jolly
indeed
said
jack
when
they
had
dug
so
much
deeper
that
they
could
only
see
out
of
the
hole
by
standing
on
tiptoe
go
on
said
the
white
fairy
so
they
dug
till
they
came
to
a
flat
stone
and
then
she
said
now
you
can
stamp
stamp
on
the
stone
and
do
be
afraid
so
the
two
jacks
began
to
stamp
and
in
such
a
little
time
that
she
had
only
half
turned
her
head
round
the
flat
stone
gave
way
for
there
was
a
hollow
underneath
it
and
down
went
the
boys
and
utterly
disappeared
then
while
mopsa
and
the
crowd
silently
looked
on
the
white
fairy
lightly
pushed
the
clods
of
earth
towards
the
hole
with
the
side
of
her
foot
and
in
a
very
few
minutes
the
hole
was
filled
in
and
that
so
completely
and
so
neatly
that
when
she
had
spread
the
turf
on
it
and
given
it
a
pat
with
her
foot
you
could
not
have
told
where
it
had
been
mopsa
said
not
a
word
for
no
fairy
ever
interferes
with
a
stronger
fairy
but
she
looked
on
earnestly
and
when
the
white
stranger
smiled
she
was
satisfied
then
the
white
stranger
walked
away
and
mopsa
and
the
fairies
sat
down
on
a
bank
under
some
splendid
the
beautiful
castle
looked
fairer
than
ever
in
the
afternoon
sunshine
a
lovely
waterfall
tumbled
with
a
tinkling
noise
near
at
hand
and
the
bank
was
covered
with
beautiful
wild
flowers
they
sat
for
a
long
while
and
no
one
spoke
what
they
were
thinking
of
is
not
known
but
sweet
mopsa
often
sighed
at
last
a
noise
a
very
very
slight
noise
as
of
the
footsteps
of
people
running
was
heard
inside
the
rock
and
then
a
little
quivering
was
seen
in
the
wand
it
quivered
more
and
more
as
the
sound
increased
at
last
that
which
had
looked
like
a
door
began
to
shake
as
if
some
one
was
pushing
it
from
within
then
a
noise
was
distinctly
heard
as
of
a
key
turning
in
the
hole
and
out
burst
the
two
jacks
shouting
for
joy
and
a
whole
troop
of
knights
and
squires
and
came
rushing
wildly
forth
behind
them
oh
the
joy
of
that
meeting
who
shall
describe
it
fairies
by
dozens
came
up
to
kiss
the
hand
and
jack
shook
hands
with
every
one
that
could
reach
him
then
mopsa
proceeded
to
the
castle
between
the
two
jacks
and
the
king
aunt
came
out
to
meet
them
and
welcomed
her
husband
with
tears
of
joy
for
these
fairies
could
laugh
and
cry
when
they
pleased
and
they
naturally
considered
this
a
great
proof
of
superiority
after
this
a
splendid
feast
was
served
under
the
great
dome
the
other
fairy
feasts
that
jack
had
seen
were
nothing
to
it
the
prince
and
his
dame
sat
at
one
board
but
mopsa
sat
at
the
head
of
the
great
table
with
the
two
jacks
one
on
each
side
of
her
mopsa
was
not
happy
jack
was
sure
of
that
for
she
often
sighed
and
he
thought
this
strange
but
he
did
not
ask
her
any
questions
and
he
with
the
related
their
adventures
to
her
how
when
the
stone
gave
way
they
tumbled
in
and
rolled
down
a
sloping
bank
till
they
found
themselves
at
the
entrance
of
a
beautiful
cave
which
was
all
lighted
up
with
torches
and
glittering
with
stars
and
crystals
of
all
the
colors
in
the
world
there
was
a
table
spread
with
what
looked
like
a
splendid
luncheon
in
this
great
cave
and
chairs
were
set
round
but
jack
and
the
felt
no
inclination
to
eat
anything
though
they
were
hungry
for
a
whole
nation
of
ants
were
creeping
up
the
there
were
snails
walking
about
over
the
and
toads
peeping
out
of
some
of
the
dishes
so
they
turned
away
and
looking
for
some
other
door
to
lead
them
farther
in
they
at
last
found
a
very
small
one
so
small
that
only
one
of
them
could
pass
through
at
a
time
they
did
not
tell
mopsa
all
that
had
occurred
on
this
occasion
it
was
thus
the
said
i
shall
go
in
first
of
course
because
of
my
rank
very
well
said
jack
i
do
mind
i
shall
say
to
myself
that
you
gone
in
first
to
find
the
way
for
me
because
you
my
double
besides
now
i
think
of
it
our
queen
always
goes
last
in
a
procession
so
it
grand
to
go
last
pass
in
jack
no
answered
the
other
jack
now
you
have
said
that
i
will
not
you
may
go
first
so
they
began
to
quarrel
and
argue
about
this
and
it
is
impossible
to
say
how
long
they
would
have
gone
on
if
they
had
not
begun
to
hear
a
terrible
and
mournful
sort
of
moaning
and
groaning
which
frightened
them
both
and
instantly
made
them
friends
they
took
tight
hold
of
one
another
hand
and
again
there
came
by
a
loud
sighing
and
a
noise
of
all
sorts
of
lamentation
and
it
seemed
to
reach
them
through
the
little
door
each
of
the
boys
would
now
have
been
very
glad
to
go
back
but
neither
liked
to
speak
at
last
jack
thought
anything
would
be
less
terrible
than
listening
to
those
dismal
moans
so
he
suddenly
dashed
through
the
door
and
the
other
jack
followed
there
was
nothing
terrible
to
be
seen
they
found
themselves
in
a
place
like
an
immensely
long
stable
but
it
was
nearly
dark
and
when
their
eyes
got
used
to
the
dimness
they
saw
that
it
was
strewed
with
quantities
of
fresh
hay
from
which
curious
things
like
sticks
stuck
up
in
all
directions
what
were
they
they
are
dry
branches
of
trees
said
the
they
are
turned
upside
down
said
jack
but
then
the
other
jack
suddenly
perceived
the
real
nature
of
the
thing
and
he
shouted
out
no
they
are
antlers
the
moment
he
said
this
the
moaning
ceased
hundreds
of
beautiful
antlered
heads
were
lifted
up
and
the
two
boys
stood
before
a
splendid
herd
of
stags
but
they
had
had
hardly
time
to
be
sure
of
this
when
the
beautiful
multitude
rose
and
fled
away
into
the
darkness
leaving
the
two
boys
to
follow
as
well
as
they
could
they
were
sure
they
ought
to
run
after
the
herd
and
they
ran
and
ran
but
they
soon
lost
sight
of
it
though
they
heard
far
on
in
front
what
seemed
at
first
like
a
pattering
of
deer
feet
but
the
sound
changed
from
time
to
time
it
became
heavier
and
louder
and
then
the
clattering
ceased
and
it
was
evidently
the
tramping
of
a
great
crowd
of
men
at
last
they
heard
words
very
glad
and
thankful
words
people
were
crying
to
one
another
to
make
haste
lest
the
spell
should
come
upon
them
again
then
the
two
jacks
still
running
came
into
a
grand
hall
which
was
quite
full
of
knights
and
all
sorts
of
fairy
men
and
there
was
the
uncle
but
he
looked
very
pale
unlock
the
door
they
cried
we
shall
not
be
safe
till
we
see
our
new
queen
unlock
the
door
we
see
light
coming
through
the
keyhole
the
two
jacks
came
on
to
the
front
and
felt
and
shook
the
door
at
last
the
saw
a
little
golden
key
glittering
on
the
floor
just
where
the
one
narrow
sunbeam
fell
that
came
through
the
keyhole
so
he
snatched
it
up
it
fitted
and
out
they
all
came
as
you
have
been
told
when
they
had
done
relating
their
adventures
the
new
queen
health
was
drunk
and
then
they
drank
the
health
of
the
who
stood
up
to
return
thanks
and
as
is
the
fashion
there
he
sang
a
song
jack
thought
it
the
most
ridiculous
song
he
had
ever
heard
but
as
everybody
else
looked
extremely
grave
he
tried
to
be
grave
too
it
was
about
and
jenny
wren
how
they
made
a
wedding
feast
and
how
the
wren
said
she
should
wear
her
brown
gown
and
the
old
dog
brought
a
bone
to
the
feast
he
had
brought
them
he
said
some
meat
on
a
bone
they
were
welcome
to
pick
it
or
leave
it
alone
the
fairies
were
very
attentive
to
this
song
they
seemed
if
one
may
judge
by
their
looks
to
think
it
was
rather
a
serious
one
then
they
drank
jack
health
and
afterwards
looked
at
him
as
if
they
expected
him
to
sing
too
but
as
he
did
not
begin
he
presently
heard
them
whispering
and
one
asking
another
do
you
think
he
knows
manners
so
he
thought
he
had
better
try
what
he
could
do
and
he
stood
up
and
sang
a
song
that
he
had
often
heard
his
nurse
sing
in
the
nursery
at
home
one
morning
oh
so
early
my
belovèd
my
belovèd
all
the
birds
were
singing
blithely
as
if
never
they
would
cease
was
a
thrush
sang
in
my
garden
hear
the
story
hear
the
story
and
the
lark
sang
give
us
glory
and
the
dove
said
give
us
peace
then
i
listened
oh
so
early
my
belovèd
my
belovèd
to
that
murmur
from
the
woodland
of
the
dove
my
dear
the
dove
when
the
nightingale
came
after
give
us
fame
to
sweeten
duty
when
the
wren
sang
give
us
beauty
she
made
answer
give
us
love
sweet
is
spring
and
sweet
the
morning
my
belovèd
my
belovèd
now
for
us
doth
spring
doth
morning
wait
upon
the
increase
and
my
prayer
goes
up
oh
give
us
crowned
in
youth
with
marriage
glory
give
for
all
our
life
dear
story
give
us
love
and
give
us
peace
a
very
good
song
too
said
the
dame
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
only
you
made
a
mistake
in
the
first
verse
what
the
dove
really
said
was
no
doubt
us
peas
all
kinds
of
doves
and
pigeons
are
very
fond
of
peas
it
is
peas
though
said
jack
however
the
court
historian
was
sent
for
to
write
down
the
song
and
he
came
with
a
quill
pen
and
wrote
it
down
as
the
dame
said
it
ought
to
be
now
all
this
time
mopsa
sat
between
the
two
jacks
and
she
looked
very
mournful
she
hardly
said
a
word
when
the
feast
was
over
and
everything
had
vanished
the
musicians
came
in
for
there
was
to
be
dancing
but
while
they
were
striking
up
the
white
fairy
stepped
in
and
coming
up
whispered
something
in
jack
ear
but
he
could
not
hear
what
she
said
so
she
repeated
it
more
slowly
and
still
he
could
neither
hear
nor
understand
it
mopsa
did
not
seem
to
like
the
white
fairy
she
leaned
her
face
on
her
hand
and
sighed
but
when
she
found
that
jack
could
not
hear
the
message
she
said
that
is
well
can
not
you
let
things
alone
for
this
one
day
the
fairy
then
spoke
to
mopsa
but
she
would
not
listen
she
made
a
gesture
of
dislike
and
moved
away
so
then
this
strange
fairy
turned
and
went
out
again
but
on
the
she
looked
round
and
beckoned
to
jack
to
come
to
her
so
he
did
and
then
as
they
two
stood
together
outside
she
made
him
understand
what
she
had
said
it
was
this
her
name
was
jenny
her
name
was
jenny
when
jack
understood
what
she
said
he
felt
so
sorrowful
he
wondered
why
she
had
told
him
and
he
longed
to
stay
in
that
great
place
with
queen
mopsa
his
own
little
mopsa
whom
he
had
carried
in
his
pocket
and
taken
care
of
and
loved
he
walked
up
and
down
up
and
down
outside
and
his
heart
swelled
and
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
the
bells
had
said
he
was
to
go
home
and
the
fairy
had
told
him
how
to
go
mopsa
did
not
need
him
she
had
so
many
people
to
take
care
of
her
and
then
there
was
that
boy
so
exactly
like
himself
that
she
would
not
miss
him
oh
how
sorrowful
it
all
was
had
he
really
come
up
the
fairy
river
and
seen
those
strange
countries
and
run
away
with
mopsa
over
those
dangerous
mountains
only
to
bring
her
to
the
very
place
she
wished
to
fly
from
and
there
to
leave
her
knowing
that
she
wanted
him
no
more
and
that
she
was
quite
content
no
jack
felt
that
he
could
not
do
that
i
will
stay
he
said
they
can
not
make
me
leave
her
that
would
be
too
unkind
as
he
spoke
he
drew
near
to
the
great
yawning
door
and
looked
in
the
fairy
folk
were
singing
inside
he
could
hear
their
pretty
chirping
voices
and
see
their
beautiful
faces
but
he
could
not
bear
it
and
he
turned
away
the
sun
began
to
get
low
and
all
the
west
was
dyed
with
crimson
jack
dried
his
eyes
and
not
liking
to
go
in
took
one
turn
more
i
will
go
in
he
said
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
me
he
set
his
foot
on
the
step
of
the
door
and
while
he
hesitated
mopsa
came
out
to
meet
him
jack
she
said
in
a
sweet
mournful
tone
of
voice
but
he
could
not
make
any
answer
he
only
looked
at
her
earnestly
because
her
lovely
eyes
were
not
looking
at
him
but
far
away
towards
the
west
he
lives
there
she
said
as
if
speaking
to
herself
he
will
play
there
again
in
his
father
garden
then
she
brought
her
eyes
down
slowly
from
the
in
the
cloud
and
looked
at
him
and
said
jack
yes
said
jack
i
am
here
what
is
it
that
you
wish
to
say
she
answered
i
am
come
to
give
you
back
your
kiss
so
she
stooped
forward
as
she
stood
on
the
step
and
kissed
him
and
her
tears
fell
on
his
cheek
farewell
she
said
and
she
turned
and
went
up
the
steps
and
into
the
great
hall
and
while
jack
gazed
at
her
as
she
entered
and
would
fain
have
followed
but
could
not
stir
the
great
doors
closed
together
again
and
he
was
left
outside
then
he
knew
without
having
been
told
that
he
should
never
enter
them
any
more
he
stood
gazing
at
the
castle
but
it
was
still
no
more
fairy
music
sounded
how
beautiful
it
looked
in
the
evening
sunshine
and
how
jack
cried
illustration
the
queen
farewell
she
stooped
forward
as
she
stood
on
the
step
and
kissed
him
page
suddenly
he
perceived
that
reeds
were
growing
up
between
him
and
the
great
doors
the
grass
which
had
all
day
grown
about
the
steps
was
getting
taller
it
had
long
leaves
it
pushed
up
long
pipes
of
green
stem
and
they
whistled
they
were
up
to
his
ankles
they
were
presently
up
to
his
waist
soon
they
were
as
high
as
his
head
he
drew
back
that
he
might
see
over
them
they
sprang
up
faster
as
he
retired
and
again
he
went
back
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
castle
also
receded
there
was
a
long
reach
of
these
great
reeds
between
it
and
him
and
now
they
were
growing
behind
also
and
on
all
sides
of
him
he
kept
moving
back
and
back
it
was
of
no
use
they
sprang
up
and
grew
yet
more
tall
till
very
shortly
the
last
glimpse
of
the
fairy
castle
was
hidden
from
his
sorrowful
eyes
the
sun
was
just
touching
the
tops
of
the
purple
mountains
when
jack
lost
sight
of
mopsa
home
but
he
remembered
how
he
had
penetrated
the
bed
of
reeds
in
the
morning
and
he
hoped
to
have
the
same
good
fortune
again
so
on
and
on
he
walked
pressing
his
way
among
them
as
well
as
he
could
till
the
sun
went
down
behind
the
mountains
and
the
rosy
sky
turned
gold
color
and
the
gold
began
to
burn
itself
away
and
then
all
on
a
sudden
he
came
to
the
edge
of
the
and
walked
out
upon
a
rising
ground
jack
ran
up
it
looking
for
the
castle
he
could
not
see
it
so
he
climbed
a
far
higher
hill
still
he
could
not
see
it
at
last
after
a
toilsome
ascent
to
the
very
top
of
the
green
mountain
he
saw
the
castle
lying
so
far
so
very
far
off
that
its
peaks
and
its
battlements
were
on
the
edge
of
the
horizon
and
the
evening
mist
rose
while
he
was
gazing
so
that
all
its
outlines
were
lost
and
very
soon
they
seemed
to
mingle
with
the
shapes
of
the
hill
and
the
forest
till
they
had
utterly
vanished
away
then
he
threw
himself
down
on
the
short
grass
the
words
of
the
white
fairy
sounded
in
his
ears
her
name
was
jenny
and
he
burst
into
tears
again
and
decided
to
go
home
he
looked
up
into
the
rosy
sky
and
held
out
his
arms
and
called
jenny
o
jenny
come
in
a
minute
or
two
he
saw
a
little
black
mark
overhead
a
small
speck
and
it
grew
larger
and
larger
and
larger
still
as
it
fell
headlong
down
like
a
stone
in
another
instant
he
saw
a
red
light
and
a
green
light
then
he
heard
the
winnowing
noise
of
the
bird
great
wings
and
she
alighted
at
his
feet
and
said
here
i
am
i
wish
to
go
home
said
jack
hanging
down
his
head
and
speaking
in
a
low
voice
for
his
heart
was
heavy
because
of
his
failure
that
is
well
answered
the
bird
she
took
jack
on
her
back
and
in
three
minutes
they
were
floating
among
the
clouds
as
jack
feet
were
lifted
up
from
fairyland
he
felt
a
little
consoled
he
began
to
have
a
curious
feeling
as
if
this
had
all
happened
a
good
while
ago
and
then
half
the
sorrow
he
had
felt
faded
into
wonder
and
the
feeling
still
grew
upon
him
that
these
things
had
passed
some
great
while
since
so
that
he
repeated
to
himself
it
was
a
long
time
ago
then
he
fell
asleep
and
did
not
dream
at
all
nor
know
anything
more
till
the
bird
woke
him
wake
up
now
jack
she
said
we
are
at
home
so
soon
said
jack
rubbing
his
eyes
but
it
is
evening
i
thought
it
would
be
morning
fairy
time
is
always
six
hours
in
advance
of
your
time
said
the
bird
i
see
glowworms
down
in
the
hedge
and
the
moon
is
just
rising
they
were
falling
so
fast
that
jack
dared
not
look
but
he
saw
the
church
and
the
wood
and
his
father
house
which
seemed
to
be
starting
up
to
meet
him
in
two
seconds
more
the
bird
alighted
and
he
stepped
down
from
her
back
into
the
deep
grass
of
his
meadow
she
said
make
haste
and
run
in
for
the
dews
are
falling
and
before
he
could
ask
her
one
question
or
even
thank
her
she
made
a
wide
sweep
over
the
grass
beat
her
magnificent
wings
and
soared
away
it
was
all
very
extraordinary
and
jack
felt
shy
and
ashamed
but
he
knew
he
must
go
home
so
he
opened
the
little
gate
that
led
into
the
garden
and
stole
through
the
shrubbery
hoping
that
his
footsteps
would
not
be
heard
then
he
came
out
on
the
lawn
where
the
were
and
he
observed
that
the
window
was
open
so
he
came
softly
towards
it
and
peeped
in
his
father
and
mother
were
sitting
there
jack
was
delighted
to
see
them
but
he
did
not
say
a
word
and
he
wondered
whether
they
would
be
surprised
at
his
having
stayed
away
so
long
the
bird
had
said
that
they
would
not
he
drew
a
little
nearer
his
mother
sat
with
her
back
to
the
open
window
but
a
candle
was
burning
and
she
was
reading
aloud
jack
listened
as
she
read
and
knew
that
this
was
not
in
the
least
like
anything
that
he
had
seen
in
fairyland
nor
the
reading
like
anything
that
he
had
heard
and
he
began
to
forget
the
and
the
and
even
his
little
mopsa
more
and
more
at
last
his
father
noticed
him
he
did
not
look
at
all
surprised
but
just
beckoned
to
him
with
his
finger
to
come
in
so
jack
did
and
got
upon
his
father
knee
where
he
curled
himself
up
comfortably
laid
his
head
on
his
father
waistcoat
and
wondered
what
he
would
think
if
he
should
be
told
about
the
fairies
in
somebody
else
waistcoat
pocket
he
thought
besides
what
a
great
thing
a
man
was
he
had
never
seen
anything
so
large
in
fairyland
nor
so
important
so
on
the
whole
he
was
glad
he
had
come
back
and
felt
very
comfortable
then
his
mother
turning
over
the
leaf
lifted
up
her
eyes
and
looked
at
jack
but
not
as
if
she
was
in
the
least
surprised
or
more
glad
to
see
him
than
usual
but
she
smoothed
the
leaf
with
her
hand
and
began
again
to
read
and
this
time
it
was
about
the
shepherd
lady
i
who
pipes
upon
the
long
green
hill
where
meadow
grass
is
deep
the
white
lamb
bleats
but
followeth
on
follow
the
clean
white
sheep
the
dear
white
lady
in
yon
high
tower
she
hearkeneth
in
her
sleep
all
in
long
grass
the
piper
stands
goodly
and
grave
is
he
outside
the
tower
at
dawn
of
day
the
notes
of
his
pipe
ring
free
a
thought
from
his
heart
doth
reach
to
hers
come
down
o
lady
to
me
she
lifts
her
head
she
dons
her
gown
ah
the
lady
is
fair
she
ties
the
girdle
on
her
waist
and
binds
her
flaxen
hair
and
down
she
stealeth
down
and
down
down
the
turret
stair
behold
him
with
the
flock

grassy
lea

shepherd

me

them
and

at
noon
albeit
the
meads

wide
oh

saith
when
day
draws
on
to
eventide
hark

the
shepherd

rain

shall

soft

speech
my
will

thine
and
my
reward

grace

are
his
footsteps
over
the
hill
withdrawn
his
goodly
face
the
mournful
dusk
begins
to
gather
the
daylight
wanes
apace
iii
on
sunny
slopes
ah
long
the
lady
feedeth
her
flock
at
noon
she
leads
them
down
to
drink
at
eve
where
the
small
rivulets
croon
all

her
locks
are
wet
with
dew
her
eyes
outwatch
the
moon
over
the
hills
her
voice
is
heard
she
sings
when
light
doth
wane
my
longing
heart
is
full
of
love
when
shall
my
loss
be
gain
my
shepherd
lord
i
see
him
not
but
he
will
come
again
when
she
had
finished
jack
lifted
his
face
and
said
mamma
then
she
came
to
him
and
kissed
him
and
his
father
said
i
think
it
must
be
time
this
man
of
ours
was
in
bed
so
he
looked
earnestly
at
them
both
and
as
they
still
asked
him
no
questions
he
kissed
and
wished
them
and
his
mother
said
there
were
some
strawberries
on
the
sideboard
in
the
and
he
might
have
them
for
his
supper
so
he
ran
out
into
the
hall
and
was
delighted
to
find
all
the
house
just
as
usual
and
after
he
had
looked
about
him
he
went
into
his
own
room
and
said
his
prayers
then
he
got
into
his
little
white
bed
and
comfortably
fell
asleep
that
all
