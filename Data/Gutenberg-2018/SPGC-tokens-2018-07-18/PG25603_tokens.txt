a
voice
from
the
introductory
we
are
familiar
with
the
names
and
deeds
of
the
generals
from
the
down
to
the
almost
innumerable
brigadiers
and
we
are
all
more
or
less
ignorant
of
the
habits
and
characteristics
of
the
individuals
who
composed
the
rank
and
file
of
the
grand
armies
of
as
time
rolls
on
the
historian
condensing
matters
mentions
the
men
by
brigades
divisions
and
corps
but
here
let
us
look
at
the
individual
soldier
separated
from
the
huge
masses
of
men
composing
the
armies
and
doing
his
own
work
and
duty
the
fame
of
lee
and
jackson
and
as
the
years
increase
ever
brighter
is
but
condensed
and
personified
admiration
of
the
confederate
soldier
wrung
from
an
unwilling
world
by
his
matchless
courage
endurance
and
devotion
their
fame
is
an
everlasting
monument
to
the
mighty
deeds
of
the
nameless
host
who
followed
them
through
so
much
toil
and
blood
to
glorious
victories
the
weak
as
a
rule
are
borne
down
by
the
strong
but
that
does
not
prove
that
the
strong
are
also
the
right
the
weak
suffer
wrong
learn
the
bitterness
of
it
and
finally
by
resisting
it
become
the
defenders
of
right
and
justice
when
the
mighty
nations
of
the
earth
oppress
the
feeble
they
nerve
the
arms
and
fire
the
hearts
of
god
instruments
for
the
restoration
of
justice
and
when
one
section
of
a
country
oppresses
and
insults
another
the
result
is
the
pervasive
malady
war
which
will
work
out
the
health
of
the
nation
or
leave
it
a
bloody
corpse
the
principles
for
which
the
confederate
soldier
fought
and
in
defense
of
which
he
died
are
the
harmony
of
this
country
so
long
as
they
were
held
in
abeyance
the
country
was
in
turmoil
and
on
the
verge
of
ruin
it
is
not
fair
to
demand
a
reason
for
actions
above
reason
the
heart
is
greater
than
the
mind
no
man
can
exactly
define
the
cause
for
which
the
confederate
soldier
fought
he
was
above
human
reason
and
above
human
law
secure
in
his
own
rectitude
of
purpose
accountable
to
god
only
having
assumed
for
himself
a
nationality
which
he
was
minded
to
defend
with
his
life
and
his
property
and
thereto
pledged
his
sacred
honor
in
the
honesty
and
simplicity
of
his
heart
the
confederate
soldier
had
neglected
his
own
interests
and
rights
until
his
accumulated
wrongs
and
indignities
forced
him
to
one
grand
prolonged
effort
to
free
himself
from
the
pain
of
them
he
dared
not
refuse
to
hear
the
call
to
arms
so
plain
was
the
duty
and
so
urgent
the
call
his
brethren
and
friends
were
answering
the
and
the
roll
of
the
drum
to
stay
was
dishonor
and
shame
he
would
not
obey
the
dictates
of
tyranny
to
disobey
was
death
he
disobeyed
and
fought
for
his
life
the
romance
of
war
charmed
him
and
he
hurried
from
the
embrace
of
his
mother
to
the
embrace
of
death
his
playmates
his
friends
and
his
associates
were
gone
he
was
lonesome
and
he
sought
a
reunion
in
camp
he
would
not
receive
as
gospel
the
dogmas
of
fanatics
and
so
he
became
a
rebel
being
a
rebel
he
must
be
punished
being
punished
he
resisted
resisting
he
died
the
confederate
soldier
opposed
immense
odds
in
the
seven
days
battles
around
richmond
drove
to
the
james
river
of
the
enemy
at
fredericksburg
in
of
them
routed
federal
troops
at
chancellorsville
in
under
lee
and
jackson
whipped
and
but
for
the
death
of
jackson
would
have
annihilated
an
army
of
men
more
than
double
their
own
number
at
gettysburg
of
them
assailed
the
heights
manned
by
at
the
wilderness
in
met
and
successfully
resisted
of
the
enemy
at
appomattox
in
april
of
them
surrendered
to
the
host
commanded
by
grant
the
united
states
government
at
the
end
of
the
war
mustered
out
of
service
of
men
and
had
in
the
field
from
first
to
last
if
the
confederate
soldier
had
then
had
only
this
disparity
of
numbers
to
contend
with
he
would
have
driven
every
invader
from
the
soil
of
virginia
but
the
confederate
soldier
fought
in
addition
to
these
odds
the
facilities
for
the
transportation
and
concentration
of
troops
and
supplies
afforded
by
the
network
of
railways
in
the
country
north
of
him
all
of
which
were
subject
to
the
control
of
the
government
and
backed
by
a
treasury
which
was
turning
out
money
by
the
ton
one
dollar
of
which
was
equal
to
sixty
confederate
dollars
it
should
be
remembered
also
that
while
the
south
was
restricted
to
its
own
territory
for
supplies
and
its
own
people
for
men
the
north
drew
on
the
world
for
material
and
on
every
nation
of
the
earth
for
men
the
arms
and
ammunition
of
the
federal
soldiers
were
abundant
and
good
so
abundant
and
so
good
that
they
supplied
armies
and
were
greatly
preferred
by
confederate
officers
the
equipment
of
the
federal
armies
was
perfect
the
facilities
for
manufacture
were
simply
unlimited
and
the
nation
thought
no
expenditure
of
treasure
too
great
if
only
the
country
the
could
be
saved
the
factory
and
the
foundry
chimneys
made
a
pillar
of
smoke
by
day
and
of
fire
by
night
the
latest
improvements
were
hurried
to
the
front
and
adopted
by
both
armies
almost
simultaneously
for
hardly
had
the
federal
bought
when
the
confederate
captured
and
used
the
commissary
stores
were
piled
up
all
over
virginia
for
the
use
of
the
invading
armies
they
had
more
than
they
could
protect
and
their
loss
was
gain
to
the
hungry
defenders
of
the
soil
the
confederate
soldier
fought
a
host
of
ills
occasioned
by
the
deprivation
of
chloroform
and
morphia
which
were
excluded
from
the
confederacy
by
the
blockade
as
contraband
of
war
the
man
who
has
submitted
to
amputation
without
chloroform
or
tossed
on
a
couch
of
agony
for
a
night
and
a
day
without
sleep
for
the
want
of
a
dose
of
morphia
may
possibly
be
able
to
estimate
the
advantages
which
resulted
from
the
possession
by
the
federal
surgeons
of
an
unlimited
supply
of
these
the
confederate
soldier
fought
bounties
and
regular
monthly
pay

rally
round
the

and
all
the
fury
and
fanaticism
which
skilled
minds
could
create
opposing
this
grand
array
with
the
modest
and
homely
refrain
of
dixie
supported
by
a
mild
solution
of
maryland
my
maryland
he
fought
good
wagons
fat
horses
and
tons
of
quartermaster
stores
pontoon
trains
of
splendid
material
and
construction
by
the
mile
gunboats
wooden
and
iron
and
illustrated
papers
to
cheer
the
boys
in
blue
with
sketches
of
the
glorious
deeds
they
did
not
do
bibles
by
the
car
load
and
tracts
by
the
million
the
first
to
prepare
them
for
death
and
the
second
to
urge
upon
them
the
duty
of
dying
the
confederate
soldier
fought
the
sanitary
commission
whose
members
armed
with
every
facility
and
convenience
quickly
carried
the
sick
and
wounded
of
the
federal
army
to
comfortable
quarters
removed
the
bloody
garments
laid
the
sufferer
on
a
clean
and
dry
couch
clothed
him
in
clean
things
and
fed
him
on
the
best
the
world
could
afford
and
money
buy
he
fought
the
thoroughly
equipped
ambulances
the
countless
surgeons
nurses
and
hospital
stewards
and
the
best
surgical
appliances
known
to
the
medical
world
he
fought
the
commerce
of
the
united
states
and
all
the
facilities
for
war
which
europe
could
supply
while
his
own
ports
were
closed
to
all
the
world
he
fought
the
trained
army
officers
and
the
regular
troops
of
the
united
states
army
assisted
by
splendid
native
volunteer
soldiers
besides
swarms

the
refuse
of

portuguese
spanish

and

he
laid
down
life
for
life
with
this
hireling
host
who
died
for
pay
mourned
by
no
one
missed
by
no
one
loved
by
no
one
who
were
better
fed
and
clothed
fatter
happier
and
more
contented
in
the
army
than
ever
they
were
at
home
and
whose
graves
strew
the
earth
in
lonesome
places
where
none
go
to
weep
when
one
of
these
fell
two
could
be
bought
to
fill
the
gap
the
confederate
soldier
killed
these
without
compunction
and
their
comrades
buried
them
without
a
tear
the
confederate
soldier
fought
the
cries
of
distress
which
came
from
his
home
tales
of
woe
want
insult
and
robbery
he
fought
men
who
knew
that
homes
when
they
had
any
were
safe
their
wives
and
children
their
parents
and
sisters
sheltered
and
their
business
affairs
more
than
usually
prosperous
who
could
draw
sight
drafts
have
them
honored
and
make
the
camp
table
as
bountiful
and
luxurious
as
that
of
a
new
york
hotel
he
fought
a
government
founded
by
the
genius
of
his
fathers
which
derived
its
strength
from
principles
they
formulated
and
which
persuaded
its
soldiers
that
they
were
the
champions
of
the
constitutional
liberty
which
they
were
marching
to
invade
and
eventually
to
destroy
the
relative
strength
of
armies
becomes
a
matter
of
secondary
importance
when
these
facts
are
considered
the
disparity
of
numbers
only
would
never
have
produced
the
result
which
the
combination
of
these
various
forces
did
the
surrender
of
the
army
of
northern
virginia
the
confederate
soldier
was
purely
patriotic
he
foresaw
clearly
and
deliberately
chose
the
trials
which
he
endured
he
was
an
individual
who
could
not
become
the
indefinite
portion
of
a
mass
but
fought
for
himself
on
his
own
account
he
was
a
hero
but
did
not
claim
that
distinction
or
any
merit
feeling
only
that
he
was
in
the
line
of
duty
to
self
country
and
god
he
fought
for
a
principle
and
needed
neither
driving
nor
urging
but
was
eager
and
determined
to
fight
he
was
not
a
politic
man
but
a
man
under
fervent
feeling
forgetful
of
the
possibilities
and
calamities
of
war
pressing
his
claims
to
the
rights
of
humanity
the
confederate
soldier
was
a
monomaniac
for
four
years
his
mania
was
the
independence
of
the
confederates
states
of
america
secured
by
force
of
arms
the
confederate
soldier
was
a
venerable
old
man
a
youth
a
child
a
preacher
a
farmer
merchant
student
statesman
orator
father
brother
husband
son
the
wonder
of
the
world
the
terror
of
his
foes
if
the
peace
of
this
country
can
only
be
preserved
by
forgetting
the
confederate
soldier
deeds
and
his
claims
upon
the
south
the
blessing
is
too
dearly
bought
we
have
sworn
to
be
grateful
to
him
dying
his
head
pillowed
on
the
bosom
of
his
mother
virginia
he
heard
that
his
name
would
be
honored
when
we
fill
up
hurriedly
the
bloody
chasm
opened
by
war
we
should
be
careful
that
we
do
not
bury
therein
many
noble
deeds
some
tender
memories
some
grand
examples
and
some
hearty
promises
washed
with
tears
the
following
letter
written
by
an
aged
father
to
his
only
son
then
a
mere
boy
who
had
volunteered
as
an
infantry
soldier
and
was
already
in
the
field
is
an
appropriate
conclusion
to
this
chapter
showing
admirably
well
the
kind
of
inspiration
which
went
from
southern
homes
to
southern
soldiers
at
home
my
dear
son
it
may
have
seemed
strange
to
you
that
a
professing
christian
father
so
freely
gave
you
a
christian
son
to
enlist
in
the
volunteer
service
my
reason
was
that
i
regarded
this
as
a
defensive
not
only
did
the
southern
confederacy
propose
to
adjust
the
pending
difficulties
by
peaceful
and
equitable
negotiations
but
virginia
used
again
and
again
the
most
earnest
and
noble
efforts
to
prevent
a
resort
to
the
sword
these
overtures
having
been
proudly
spurned
and
our
beloved
south
having
been
threatened
with
invasion
and
subjugation
it
seemed
to
me
that
nothing
was
left
us
but
stern
resistance
or
abject
submission
to
unconstitutional
power
a
brave
and
generous
people
could
not
for
a
moment
hesitate
between
such
alternatives
a
war
in
defense
of
our
homes
and
firesides
of
our
wives
and
children
of
all
that
makes
life
worth
possessing
is
the
result
while
i
most
deeply
deplored
the
necessity
for
the
sacrifice
i
could
not
but
rejoice
that
i
had
a
son
to
offer
to
the
service
of
the
country
and
if
i
had
a
dozen
would
most
freely
give
them
as
you
are
now
cheerfully
enduring
the
hardships
of
the
camp
i
know
you
will
listen
to
a
suggestions
touching
the
duties
of
your
new
mode
of
life
take
special
care
of
your
health
more
soldiers
die
of
disease
than
in
battle
a
thin
piece
of
damp
sponge
in
the
crown
of
your
hat
during
exposure
to
the
hot
sun
the
use
of
thick
shoes
and
a
coat
in
rainy
weather
the
practice
of
drinking
cold
water
when
you
are
very
warm
as
slowly
as
you
sip
hot
tea
the
thorough
mastication
of
your
food
the
avoiding
of
damp
tents
and
damp
grounds
during
sleep
and
frequent
ablutions
of
your
person
are
all
the
hints
i
can
give
you
on
this
point
should
you
need
anything
that
i
can
supply
let
me
hear
from
you
i
will
do
what
i
can
to
make
you
comfortable
after
all
you
must
learn
to
endure
hardness
as
a
good
soldier
having
never
slept
a
single
night
in
your
whole
life
except
in
a
pleasant
bed
and
never
known
a
scarcity
of
good
food
you
doubtless
find
the
ways
of
the
camp
rough
but
never
mind
the
war
i
trust
will
soon
be
over
and
then
the
remembrance
of
your
hardships
will
sweeten
the
joy
of
peace
the
rules
of
war
require
prompt
and
unquestioning
obedience
you
may
sometimes
think
the
command
arbitrary
and
the
officer
supercilious
but
is
yours
to
an
undisciplined
army
is
a
curse
to
its
friends
and
a
derision
to
its
foes
give
your
whole
influence
therefore
to
the
maintenance
of
lawful
authority
and
of
strict
order
let
your
superiors
feel
assured
that
whatever
they
entrust
to
will
be
faithfully
done
composed
of
such
soldiers
and
led
by
skillful
and
brave
commanders
our
army
by
the
blessing
of
god
will
never
be
defeated
it
is
moreover
engaged
in
a
holy
cause
and
must
triumph
try
to
maintain
your
christian
profession
among
your
comrades
i
need
not
caution
you
against
strong
drink
as
useless
and
hurtful
nor
against
profanity
so
common
among
soldiers
both
these
practices
you
abhor
aim
to
take
at
once
a
decided
stand
for
god
if
practicable
have
prayers
regularly
in
your
tent
or
unite
with
your
in
in
the
camp
should
preaching
be
accessible
always
be
a
hearer
let
the
world
know
that
you
are
a
christian
read
a
chapter
in
the
new
testament
which
your
mother
gave
you
every
morning
and
evening
when
you
can
and
engage
in
secret
prayer
to
god
for
his
holy
spirit
to
guide
and
sustain
you
i
would
rather
hear
of
your
death
than
of
the
shipwreck
of
your
faith
and
good
conscience
as
you
will
come
into
habitual
contact
with
men
of
every
grade
make
special
associates
only
of
those
whose
influence
on
your
character
is
felt
to
be
good
some
men
love
to
tell
extravagant
stories
to
indulge
in
vulgar
wit
to
exult
in
a
swaggering
carriage
to
pride
themselves
on
their
coarse
manners
to
boast
of
their
heroism
and
to
give
utterance
to
feelings
of
revenge
against
the
enemy
all
this
is
injurious
to
young
and
impressible
minds
if
you
admire
such
things
you
will
insensibly
imitate
them
and
imitation
will
work
gradual
but
certain
detriment
to
your
character
other
men
are
refined
without
being
affected
they
can
relax
into
occasional
pleasantries
without
violating
modesty
they
can
be
loyal
to
their
government
without
indulging
private
hatred
against
her
foes
they
can
be
cool
and
brave
in
battle
and
not
be
braggarts
in
the
absence
of
danger
above
all
they
can
be
humble
spiritual
and
active
christians
and
yet
mingle
in
the
stirring
and
perilous
duties
of
let
these
be
your
companions
and
models
you
will
thus
return
from
the
dangers
of
camp
without
a
blemish
on
your
name
should
it
be
your
lot
to
enter
into
an
engagement
with
the
enemy
lift
up
your
heart
in
secret
ejaculations
to
the
and
good
being
that
he
will
protect
you
from
sudden
death
or
if
you
fall
that
he
will
receive
your
departing
spirit
cleansed
in
the
blood
of
jesus
into
his
kingdom
it
is
better
to
trust
in
the
lord
than
to
put
confidence
in
princes
commit
your
eternal
interests
therefore
to
the
keeping
of
the
almighty
saviour
you
should
not
even
in
the
hour
of
deadly
conflict
cherish
personal
rage
against
the
enemy
any
more
than
an
officer
of
the
law
hates
the
victim
of
the
law
how
often
does
a
victorious
army
tenderly
care
for
the
dead
and
wounded
of
the
vanquished
war
is
a
tremendous
scourge
which
providence
sometimes
uses
to
chastise
proud
and
wicked
nations
both
parties
must
suffer
even
though
one
may
get
the
advantage
there
is
no
occasion
then
for
adding
to
the
intrinsic
evils
of
the
system
the
odious
feature
of
animosity
to
individuals
in
the
ranks
of
the
foe
are
thousands
of
plain
men
who
do
not
understand
the
principles
for
which
we
are
struggling
they
are
deceived
by
artful
demagogues
into
a
posture
of
hostility
to
those
whom
knowing
they
would
love
it
is
against
such
men
that
you
may
perhaps
be
arrayed
and
the
laws
of
war
do
not
forbid
you
to
pity
them
even
in
the
act
of
destroying
them
it
is
the
more
important
that
should
exhibit
a
proper
temper
in
this
unfortunate
contest
because
many
professed
christians
and
ministers
of
the
gospel
at
the
north
are
breathing
out
in
their
very
prayers
and
sermons
threatenings
and
slaughter
against
us
oh
how
painful
that
a
pastor
should
publicly
exclaim
would
hang
them
as
quick
as
i
would
shoot
a
mad
dog
providence
has
placed
you
in
the
midst
of
thoughtless
and
unpardoned
men
what
a
beautiful
thing
it
would
be
if
you
could
win
some
of
them
to
the
saviour
will
you
not
try
you
will
have
many
opportunities
of
saying
a
word
in
season
the
sick
you
may
comfort
the
wavering
you
may
confirm
the
backslidden
you
may
reclaim
the
weary
and
heavy
laden
you
may
point
to
jesus
for
rest
to
the
soul
it
is
not
presumptuous
for
a
young
man
kindly
and
meekly
to
commend
the
gospel
to
his
brother
soldiers
the
hardest
of
them
will
not
repel
a
gentle
approach
made
in
private
and
many
of
them
would
doubtless
be
glad
to
have
the
subject
introduced
to
them
they
desire
to
hear
of
jesus
but
they
lack
courage
to
inquire
of
his
people
an
unusually
large
proportion
of
pious
men
have
entered
the
army
and
i
trust
they
will
give
a
new
complexion
to
military
life
let
them
search
out
each
other
and
establish
a
fraternity
among
all
the
worshipers
of
god
to
interchange
religious
views
and
administer
brotherly
counsel
will
be
mutually
edifying
he
that
watereth
shall
be
watered
also
himself
and
now
as
a
soldier
has
but
little
leisure
i
will
not
occupy
you
longer
be
assured
that
every
morning
and
evening
we
remember
you
at
the
family
altar
to
our
father
in
heaven
we
pray
for
a
speedy
just
and
honorable
peace
and
for
the
safe
return
of
all
the
volunteers
to
their
loved
homes
all
the
children
speak
often
of
brother
and
hear
your
letters
read
with
intense
interest
that
god
almighty
may
be
your
shield
and
your
exceeding
great
reward
is
the
constant
prayer
of
your
loving

chapter
ii
the
outfit
modified
with
the
men
who
composed
the
army
of
northern
virginia
will
die
the
memory
of
those
little
things
which
made
the
confederate
soldier
peculiarly
what
he
was
the
historian
who
essays
to
write
the
grand
movements
will
hardly
stop
to
tell
how
the
hungry
private
fried
his
bacon
baked
his
biscuit
and
smoked
his
pipe
how
he
was
changed
from
time
to
time
by
the
necessities
of
the
service
until
the
gentleman
the
student
the
merchant
the
mechanic
and
the
farmer
were
merged
into
a
perfect
and
invincible
soldier
to
preserve
these
little
details
familiar
to
all
soldiers
and
by
them
not
thought
worthy
of
mention
to
others
because
of
their
familiarity
but
still
dear
to
them
and
always
the
substance
of
their
war
talks
is
the
object
of
this
book
the
volunteer
of
made
extensive
preparations
for
the
field
boots
he
thought
were
an
absolute
necessity
and
the
heavier
the
soles
and
longer
the
tops
the
better
his
pants
were
stuffed
inside
the
tops
of
his
boots
of
course
a
coat
heavily
wadded
with
two
rows
of
big
brass
buttons
and
a
long
skirt
was
considered
comfortable
a
small
stiff
cap
with
a
narrow
brim
took
the
place
of
the
comfortable
felt
or
the
shining
and
towering
tile
worn
in
civil
life
illustration
the
outfit
of
then
over
all
was
a
huge
overcoat
long
and
heavy
with
a
cape
reaching
nearly
to
the
waist
on
his
back
he
strapped
a
knapsack
containing
a
full
stock
of
underwear
soap
towels
comb
brush
paper
and
envelopes
pens
ink
pencils
blacking
photographs
smoking
and
chewing
tobacco
pipes
twine
string
and
cotton
strips
for
wounds
and
other
emergencies
needles
and
thread
buttons
knife
fork
and
spoon
and
many
other
things
as
each
idea
of
what
he
was
to
encounter
varied
on
the
outside
of
the
knapsack
solidly
folded
were
two
great
blankets
and
a
rubber
or
this
knapsack
weighed
from
fifteen
to
pounds
sometimes
even
more
all
seemed
to
think
it
was
impossible
to
have
on
too
many
or
too
heavy
clothes
or
to
have
too
many
conveniences
and
each
had
an
idea
that
to
be
a
good
soldier
he
must
be
provided
against
every
possible
emergency
in
addition
to
the
knapsack
each
man
had
a
haversack
more
or
less
costly
some
of
cloth
and
some
of
fine
morocco
and
stored
with
provisions
always
as
though
he
expected
any
moment
to
receive
orders
to
march
across
the
great
desert
and
supply
his
own
wants
on
the
way
a
canteen
was
considered
indispensable
and
at
the
outset
it
was
thought
prudent
to
keep
it
full
of
water
many
expecting
terrific
encounters
carried
revolvers
and
even
merino
shirts
and
flannel
were
thought
to
be
the
right
thing
but
experience
demonstrated
the
contrary
gloves
were
also
thought
to
be
very
necessary
and
good
things
to
have
in
winter
time
the
favorite
style
being
buck
gauntlets
with
long
cuffs
in
addition
to
each
man
private
luggage
each
mess
generally
composed
of
from
five
to
ten
men
drawn
together
by
similar
tastes
and
associations
had
outfit
consisting
of
a
large
camp
chest
containing
skillet
frying
pan
coffee
boiler
bucket
for
lard
coffee
box
salt
box
sugar
box
meal
box
flour
box
knives
forks
spoons
plates
cups
etc
these
chests
were
so
large
that
eight
or
ten
of
them
filled
up
an
army
wagon
and
were
so
heavy
that
two
strong
men
had
all
they
could
do
to
get
one
of
them
into
the
wagon
in
addition
to
the
chest
each
mess
owned
an
axe
water
bucket
and
bread
tray
then
the
tents
of
each
company
and
little
stoves
and
stove
pipe
and
the
trunks
and
valises
of
the
company
officers
made
an
immense
pile
of
stuff
so
that
each
company
had
a
small
wagon
train
of
its
own
all
thought
money
to
be
absolutely
necessary
and
for
awhile
rations
were
disdained
and
the
mess
supplied
with
the
best
that
could
be
bought
with
the
mess
fund
quite
a
large
number
had
a
boy
along
to
do
the
cooking
and
washing
think
of
it
a
confederate
soldier
with
a
body
servant
all
his
own
to
bring
him
a
drink
of
water
black
his
boots
dust
his
clothes
cook
his
corn
bread
and
bacon
and
put
wood
on
his
fire
never
was
there
fonder
admiration
than
these
darkies
displayed
for
their
masters
their
chief
delight
and
glory
was
to
praise
the
courage
and
good
looks
of
mahse
tom
and
prophesy
great
things
about
his
future
many
a
ringing
laugh
and
shout
of
fun
originated
in
the
queer
remarks
shining
countenance
and
glistening
teeth
of
this
now
forever
departed
character
it
is
amusing
to
think
of
the
follies
of
the
early
part
of
the
war
as
illustrated
by
the
outfits
of
the
volunteers
they
were
so
heavily
clad
and
so
burdened
with
all
manner
of
things
that
a
march
was
torture
and
the
wagon
trains
were
so
immense
in
proportion
to
the
number
of
troops
that
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
guard
them
in
an
enemy
country
subordinate
officers
thought
themselves
entitled
to
transportation
for
trunks
mattresses
and
folding
bedsteads
and
the
privates
were
as
ridiculous
in
their
demands
thus
much
by
way
of
introduction
the
change
came
rapidly
and
stayed
not
until
the
transformation
was
complete
nor
was
this
change
attributable
alone
to
the
orders
of
the
general
officers
the
men
soon
learned
the
inconvenience
and
danger
of
so
much
luggage
and
as
they
became
more
experienced
they
vied
with
each
other
in
reducing
themselves
to
trim
experience
soon
demonstrated
that
boots
were
not
agreeable
on
a
long
march
they
were
heavy
and
irksome
and
when
the
heels
were
worn
a
little
the
wearer
would
find
his
ankle
twisted
nearly
out
of
joint
by
every
unevenness
of
the
road
when
thoroughly
wet
it
was
a
laborious
undertaking
to
get
them
off
and
worse
to
get
them
on
in
time
to
answer
the
morning
and
so
good
strong
brogues
or
brogans
with
broad
bottoms
and
big
flat
heels
succeeded
the
boots
and
were
found
much
more
comfortable
and
agreeable
easier
put
on
and
off
and
altogether
the
more
sensible
a
and
jacket
usurped
the
place
of
the
coat
and
became
universal
the
enemy
noticed
this
peculiarity
and
called
the
confederates
gray
jackets
which
name
was
immediately
transferred
to
those
lively
creatures
which
were
the
constant
admirers
and
inseparable
companions
of
the
boys
in
gray
and
in
blue
caps
were
destined
to
hold
out
longer
than
some
other
uncomfortable
things
but
they
finally
yielded
to
the
demands
of
comfort
and
common
sense
and
a
good
soft
felt
hat
was
worn
instead
a
man
who
has
never
been
a
soldier
does
not
know
nor
indeed
can
know
the
amount
of
comfort
there
is
in
a
good
soft
hat
in
camp
and
how
utterly
useless
is
a
soldier
hat
as
they
are
generally
made
why
the
prussians
with
all
their
experience
wear
their
heavy
unyielding
helmets
and
the
french
their
little
caps
is
a
mystery
to
a
confederate
who
has
enjoyed
the
comfort
of
an
old
slouch
overcoats
an
inexperienced
man
would
think
an
absolute
necessity
for
men
exposed
to
the
rigors
of
a
northern
virginia
winter
but
they
grew
scarcer
and
scarcer
they
were
found
to
be
a
great
inconvenience
the
men
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
trouble
of
carrying
them
on
hot
days
outweighed
the
comfort
of
having
them
when
the
cold
day
arrived
besides
they
found
that
life
in
the
open
air
hardened
them
to
such
an
extent
that
changes
in
the
temperature
were
not
felt
to
any
degree
some
clung
to
their
overcoats
to
the
last
but
the
majority
got
tired
lugging
them
around
and
either
discarded
them
altogether
or
trusted
to
capturing
one
about
the
time
it
would
be
needed
nearly
every
overcoat
in
the
army
in
the
latter
years
was
one
of
uncle
sam
captured
from
his
boys
the
knapsack
vanished
early
in
the
struggle
it
was
inconvenient
to
change
the
underwear
too
often
and
the
disposition
not
to
change
grew
as
the
knapsack
was
found
to
gall
the
back
and
shoulders
and
weary
the
man
before
half
the
march
was
accomplished
the
better
way
was
to
dress
out
and
out
and
wear
that
outfit
until
the
enemy
knapsacks
or
the
folks
at
home
supplied
a
change
certainly
it
did
not
pay
to
carry
around
clean
clothes
while
waiting
for
the
time
to
use
them
very
little
washing
was
done
as
a
matter
of
course
clothes
once
given
up
were
parted
with
forever
there
were
good
reasons
for
this
cold
water
would
not
cleanse
them
or
destroy
the
vermin
and
hot
water
was
not
always
to
be
had
one
blanket
to
each
man
was
found
to
be
as
much
as
could
be
carried
and
amply
sufficient
for
the
severest
weather
this
was
carried
generally
by
rolling
it
lengthwise
with
the
rubber
cloth
outside
tying
the
ends
of
the
roll
together
and
throwing
the
loop
thus
made
over
the
left
shoulder
with
the
ends
fastened
together
hanging
under
the
right
arm
the
haversack
held
its
own
to
the
last
and
was
found
practical
and
useful
it
very
seldom
however
contained
rations
but
was
used
to
carry
all
the
articles
generally
carried
in
the
knapsack
of
course
the
stock
was
small
somehow
or
other
many
men
managed
to
do
without
the
haversack
and
carried
absolutely
nothing
but
what
they
wore
and
had
in
their
pockets
the
infantry
threw
away
their
heavy
cap
boxes
and
cartridge
boxes
and
carried
their
caps
and
cartridges
in
their
pockets
canteens
were
very
useful
at
times
but
they
were
as
a
general
thing
discarded
they
were
not
much
used
to
carry
water
but
were
found
useful
when
the
men
were
driven
to
the
necessity
of
foraging
for
conveying
buttermilk
cider
sorghum
to
camp
a
good
strong
tin
cup
was
found
better
than
a
canteen
as
it
was
easier
to
fill
at
a
well
or
spring
and
was
serviceable
as
a
boiler
for
making
coffee
when
the
column
halted
for
the
night
revolvers
were
found
to
be
about
as
useless
and
heavy
lumber
as
a
private
soldier
could
carry
and
early
in
the
war
were
sent
home
to
be
used
by
the
women
and
children
in
protecting
themselves
from
insult
and
violence
at
the
hands
of
the
ruffians
who
prowled
about
the
country
shirking
duty
strong
cotton
was
adopted
in
place
of
flannel
and
merino
for
two
reasons
first
because
easier
to
wash
and
second
because
the
vermin
did
not
propagate
so
rapidly
in
cotton
as
in
wool
common
white
cotton
shirts
and
drawers
proved
the
best
that
could
be
used
by
the
private
soldier
gloves
to
any
but
a
mounted
man
were
found
useless
worse
than
useless
with
the
gloves
on
it
was
impossible
to
handle
an
axe
buckle
harness
load
a
musket
or
handle
a
rammer
at
the
piece
wearing
them
was
found
to
be
simply
a
habit
and
so
on
the
principle
that
the
less
luggage
the
less
labor
were
discarded
the
soon
vanished
the
brigadiers
and
even
found
them
too
troublesome
and
soon
they
were
left
entirely
to
the
quartermasters
and
commissaries
one
skillet
and
a
couple
of
frying
pans
a
bag
for
flour
or
meal
another
bag
for
salt
sugar
and
coffee
divided
by
a
knot
tied
between
served
the
purpose
as
well
the
skillet
passed
from
mess
to
mess
each
mess
generally
owned
a
frying
pan
but
often
one
served
a
company
the
was
found
to
be
as
good
as
the
wooden
tray
for
making
up
the
dough
the
water
bucket
held
its
own
to
the
last
tents
were
all
the
poetry
about
the
died
two
men
slept
together
each
having
a
blanket
and
an
one
went
next
to
the
ground
the
two
laid
on

very
little
money
was
seen
in
camp
the
men
did
not
expect
did
not
care

often
get
any
pay
and
they
were
not
willing
to
deprive
the
old
folks
at

of
their
little
supply
so
they
learned
to
do
without
any
money
when
rations
got
short

were
getting
shorter

became
necessary
to
dismiss

the

one

one

one
pair
of

one
pair
of
shoes
and
one

his
baggage
was
one
blanket
one
rubber

and
one
haversack
the
haversack
generally
contained
smoking
tobacco
and
a

and
a
small
piece
of
soap
with
temporary
additions
of
apples
persimmons
blackberries
and
such
other
commodities
as

could
pick
up
on

the
company
property
consisted
of
two
or
three
skillets
and
frying
pans
which
were
sometimes
carried
in
the
wagon
but
oftener
in
the
hands
of
the
soldiers
the
infantrymen
generally
preferred
to
stick
the
handle
of
the
frying
pan
in
the
barrel
of
a
musket
and
so
carry
it
the

were
devoted
entirely
to

the

they
had
any
was
carried
by
the

themselves
if
as
was
sometimes
the
case
three
days
rations
were
issued
at
one
time
and
the
troops
ordered
to
cook
them
and
be
prepared
to
march
they
did
cook
them
eat
them
if
so
as
to
avoid
the
labor
of
carrying
them
it
was
not
such
an
undertaking
either
to
eat
three
days
rations
in
one
as
frequently
none
had
been
issued
for
more
than
a
day
and
when
issued
were
cut
down
one
half
the
infantry
found
out
that
bayonets
were
not
of
much
use
and
did
not
hesitate
to
throw
them
with
the
scabbard
away
the
artillerymen
who
started
out
with
heavy
sabres
hanging
to
their
belts
stuck
them
up
in
the
mud
as
they
marched
and
left
them
for
the
ordnance
officers
to
pick
up
and
turn
over
to
the
cavalry
the
cavalrymen
found
sabres
very
tiresome
when
swung
to
the
belt
and
adopted
the
plan
of
fastening
them
to
the
saddle
on
the
left
side
with
the
hilt
in
front
and
in
reach
of
the
hand
finally
sabres
got
very
scarce
even
among
the
cavalrymen
who
relied
more
and
more
on
their
short
rifles
no
soldiers
ever
marched
with
less
to
encumber
them
and
none
marched
faster
or
held
out
longer
the
courage
and
devotion
of
the
men
rose
equal
to
every
hardship
and
privation
and
the
very
intensity
of
their
sufferings
became
a
source
of
merriment
instead
of
growling
and
deserting
they
laughed
at
their
own
bare
feet
ragged
clothes
and
pinched
faces
and
weak
hungry
cold
wet
worried
with
vermin
and
itch
dirty
with
no
hope
of
reward
or
rest
marched
cheerfully
to
meet
the
and
warmly
clad
hosts
of

chapter
iii
romantic
ideas
dissipated
to
offer
a
man
promotion
in
the
early
part
of
the
war
was
equivalent
to
an
insult
the
higher
the
social
position
the
greater
the
wealth
the
more
patriotic
it
would
be
to
serve
in
the
humble
position
of
a
private
and
many
men
of
education
and
ability
in
the
various
professions
refusing
promotion
served
under
the
command
of
men
greatly
their
inferiors
mentally
morally
and
as
soldiers
it
soon
became
apparent
that
the
country
wanted
knowledge
and
ability
as
well
as
muscle
and
endurance
and
those
who
had
capacity
to
serve
in
higher
positions
were
promoted
still
it
remained
true
that
inferior
men
commanded
their
superiors
in
every
respect
save
one
rank
and
leaving
out
the
one
difference
of
rank
the
officers
and
men
were
about
on
a
par
it
took
years
to
teach
the
educated
privates
in
the
army
that
it
was
their
duty
to
give
unquestioning
obedience
to
officers
because
they
were
such
who
were
awhile
ago
their
playmates
and
associates
in
business
it
frequently
happened
that
the
private
feeling
hurt
by
the
stern
authority
of
the
officer
would
ask
him
to
one
side
challenge
him
to
personal
combat
and
thrash
him
well
after
awhile
these
privates
learned
all
about
extra
duty
half
rations
and
it
was
only
to
conquer
this
independent
resistance
of
discipline
that
punishment
or
force
was
necessary
the
privates
were
as
willing
and
anxious
to
fight
and
serve
as
the
officers
and
needed
no
pushing
up
to
their
duty
it
is
amusing
to
recall
the
disgust
with
which
the
men
would
hear
of
their
assignment
to
the
rear
as
reserves
they
regarded
the
order
as
a
deliberate
insult
planned
by
some
officer
who
had
a
grudge
against
their
regiment
or
battery
who
had
adopted
this
plan
to
prevent
their
presence
in
battle
and
thus
humiliate
them
how
soon
did
they
learn
the
sweetness
of
a
day
repose
in
the
rear
another
romantic
notion
which
for
awhile
possessed
the
boys
was
that
soldiers
should
not
try
to
be
comfortable
but
glory
in
getting
wet
being
cold
hungry
and
tired
so
they
refused
shelter
in
houses
or
barns
and
like
true
soldiers
paddled
about
in
the
mud
and
rain
thinking
thereby
to
serve
their
country
better
the
real
troubles
had
not
come
and
they
were
in
a
hurry
to
suffer
some
they
had
not
long
thus
impatiently
to
wait
nor
could
they
latterly
complain
of
the
want
of
a
chance
to
do
or
die
volunteering
for
perilous
or
very
onerous
duty
was
popular
at
the
outset
but
as
duties
of
this
kind
thickened
it
began
to
be
thought
time
enough
when
the
orders
were
peremptory
or
the
orderly
read
the
detail
another
fancy
idea
was
that
the
principal
occupation
of
a
soldier
should
be
actual
conflict
with
the
enemy
they
did
dream
of
such
a
thing
as
camping
for
six
months
at
a
time
without
firing
a
gun
or
marching
and
countermarching
to
mislead
the
enemy
or
driving
wagons
and
ambulances
building
bridges
currying
horses
and
the
thousand
commonplace
duties
of
the
soldier
on
the
other
hand
great
importance
was
attached
to
some
duties
which
soon
became
mere
drudgery
sometimes
the
whole
detail
for
guard
first
second
and
third
relief
would
make
it
a
point
of
honor
to
sit
up
the
entire
night
and
watch
and
listen
as
though
the
enemy
might
pounce
upon
them
at
any
moment
and
hurry
them
off
to
prison
of
course
they
soon
learned
how
sweet
it
was
after
two
hours
walking
of
the
beat
to
turn
in
for
which
seemed
to
the
sleepy
man
an
eternity
in
anticipation
but
only
a
brief
time
in
retrospect
when
the
corporal
gave
him
a
chunk
and
remarked
time
to
go
on
guard

third
relief
everybody
remembers
how
we
used
to
talk
about
one
confederate
whipping
a
dozen
yankees
literally
true
sometimes
but
generally
speaking
two
to
one
made
hard
work
for
the
boys
they
did
know
at
the
beginning
anything
about
the
advantage
the
enemy
had
in
being
able
to
present
man
for
man
in
front
and
then
send
as
many
more
to
worry
the
flanks
and
rear
they
learned
something
about
this
very
soon
and
had
to
contend
against
it
on
almost
every
field
they
won
wounds
were
in
great
demand
after
the
first
wounded
hero
made
his
appearance
his
wound
was
the
envy
of
thousands
of
unfortunates
who
had
not
so
much
as
a
scratch
to
boast
and
who
felt
small
and
of
little
consequence
before
the
man
with
a
bloody
bandage
many
became
despondent
and
groaned
as
they
thought
that
perchance
after
all
they
were
doomed
to
go
home
safe
and
sound
and
hear
for
all
time
the
praises
of
the
fellow
who
had
lost
his
arm
by
a
cannon
shot
or
had
his
face
ripped
by
a
sabre
or
his
head
smashed
with
a
fragment
of
shell
after
awhile
the
wound
was
regarded
as
a
practical
benefit
it
secured
a
furlough
of
indefinite
length
good
eating
the
attention
and
admiration
of
the
fair
and
if
permanently
disabling
a
discharge
wisdom
born
of
experience
soon
taught
all
hands
better
sense
and
the
fences
and
trees
and
ditches
and
rocks
became
valuable
and
eagerly
sought
after
when
the
music
of
minie
and
the
roar
of
the
napoleon
was
heard
death
on
the
field
glorious
first
and
last
was
dared
for
duty
sake
but
the
good
soldier
learned
to
guard
his
life
and
yield
it
only
at
the
call
of
duty
only
the
wisest
men
those
who
had
seen
war
before
imagined
that
the
war
would
last
more
than
a
few
months
the
young
volunteers
thought
one
good
battle
would
settle
the
whole
matter
and
indeed
after
first
manassas
many
thought
they
might
as
well
go
home
the
whole
north
was
frightened
and
no
more
armies
would
dare
assail
the
soil
of
old
virginia
colonels
and
brigadiers
with
flesh
wounds
not
worthy
of
notice
rushed
to
richmond
to
report
the
victory
and
the
end
of
the
war
they
had
seen
sights
in
the
way
of
wounded
and
killed
plunder
and
according
to
their
views
no
sane
people
would
try
again
to
conquer
the
heroes
of
that
remarkable
day
the
newspaper
men
delighted
in
telling
the
soldiers
that
the
yankees
were
a
diminutive
race
of
feeble
constitution
timid
as
hares
with
no
enthusiasm
and
that
they
would
perish
in
short
order
under
the
glow
of
our
southern
sun
any
one
who
has
seen
a
regiment
from
ohio
or
maine
knows
how
true
these
statements
were
and
besides
the
newspapers
did
not
mention
the
english
irish
german
french
italian
spanish
swiss
portuguese
and
negroes
who
were
to
swell
the
numbers
of
the
enemy
and
as
our
army
grew
less
make
his
larger
true
there
was
not
much
fight
in
all
this
rubbish
but
they
answered
well
enough
for
drivers
of
wagons
and
ambulances
guarding
stores
and
lines
of
communication
and
doing
all
sorts
of
duty
while
the
good
material
was
doing
the
fighting
sherman
army
marching
through
richmond
after
the
surrender
of
lee
and
johnston
seemed
to
be
composed
of
a
race
of
giants
and
illustration
an
early
hero
many
feared
the
war
would
end
before
they
would
have
a
fair
chance
to
make
a
record
and
that
when
the
cruel
war
was
over
they
would
have
to
sit
by
dumb
and
hear
the
more
fortunate
ones
who
had
smelt
the
battle
tell
to
admiring
home
circles
the
story
of
the
bloody
field
most
of
these
got
in
in
time
to
satisfy
their
longings
and
got
out
to
learn
that
the
man
who
did
not
go
but
kept
out
and
made
money
was
more
admired
and
courted
than
the
poor
fellow
with
one
leg
or
arm
less
than
is
allowed
it
is
fortunate
for
those
who
skulked
that
the
war
ended
as
it
did
for
had
the
south
been
successful
the
soldiers
would
have
been
favored
with
every
mark
of
distinction
and
honor
and
they
despised
and
rejected
as
they
deserved
to
be
while
the
war
lasted
it
was
the
delight
of
some
of
the
stoutly
built
fellows
to
go
home
for
a
few
days
and
kick
and
cuff
and
the
how
coolly
and
submissively
they
took
it
all
how
big
they
are
now
the
rubbish
accumulated
by
the
hope
of
recognition
burdened
the
soldiers

to
the
end
england
was
to
abolish
the
blockade
and
send
us
immense
supplies
of
fine
arms

and
small
france
was
thinking
about
landing
an
imperial
force
in
mexico
and
marching
thence
to
the
relief
of
the
south
but
the
confederate
yell
never
had
an
echo
in
the
marseillaise
or

the
queen
and

dixie
was
destined
to
sing
her
own

without

my

the

with

which
was
to
give
uncle

trouble
and
the

ally
never
came
those
immense
balloons
which
somebody
was
always
inventing
and
which
were
to
sail
over
the
enemy
camps
dropping
whole
cargoes
of
explosives
never
tugged
at
their
anchors
or
sailed
majestically
away
as
discipline
improved
and
the
men
began
to
feel
that
they
were
no
longer
simply
volunteers
but
the
romantic
devotion
which
they
had
felt
was
succeeded
by
a
feeling
of
constraint
and
necessity
and
while
the
army
was
in
reality
very
much
improved
and
strengthened
by
the
change
the
soldiers
imagined
the
contrary
to
be
the
case
and
if
discipline
had
been
pushed
to
too
great
an
extent
the
army
would
have
been
deprived
of
the
very
essence
of
its
life
and
power
when
the
officers
began
to
assert
superiority
by
withdrawing
from
the
messes
and
organizing
officers
messes
the
bond
of
brotherhood
was
weakened
and
who
will
say
that
the
dignity
which
was
thus
maintained
was
compensation
for
the
loss
of
personal
devotion
as
between
comrades
at
the
outset
the
fact
that
men
were
in
the
same
company
put
them
somewhat
on
the
same
level
and
produced
an
almost
perfect
bond
of
sympathy
but
as
time
wore
on
the
various
peculiarities
and
weaknesses
of
the
men
showed
themselves
and
each
company
as
a
community
separated
into
distinct
circles
as
indifferent
to
each
other
save
in
the
common
cause
as
though
they
had
never
met
as
friends
the
pride
of
the
volunteers
was
sorely
tried
by
the
incoming
of
conscripts
the
most
despised
class
in
the
army
and
their
devotion
to
company
and
regiment
was
visibly
lessened
they
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
having
these
men
for
comrades
and
felt
the
flag
insulted
when
claimed
by
one
of
them
as
his
flag
it
was
a
great
source
of
annoyance
to
the
true
men
but
was
a
necessity
conscripts
crowded
together
in
companies
regiments
and
brigades
would
have
been
useless
but
scattered
here
and
there
among
the
good
men
were
utilized
and
so
gradually
the
pleasure
that
men
had
in
being
associated
with
others
whom
they
respected
as
equals
was
taken
away
and
the
social
aspect
of
army
life
seriously
marred
the
next
serious
blow
to
romance
was
the
abolishment
of
elections
and
the
appointment
of
officers
instead
of
the
privilege
and
pleasure
of
picking
out
some
brave
comrade
and
making
him
captain
the
lieutenant
was
promoted
without
the
consent
of
the
men
or
what
was
harder
to
bear
some
officer
hitherto
unknown
was
sent
to
take
command
this
was
no
doubt
better
for
the
service
but
it
had
a
serious
effect
on
the
minds
of
volunteer
patriot
soldiers
and
looked
to
them
too
much
like
arbitrary
power
exercised
over
men
who
were
fighting
that
very
principle
they
frequently
had
to
acknowledge
however
that
the
officers
were
all
they
could
ask
and
in
many
instances
became
devotedly
attached
to
them
as
the
companies
were
decimated
by
disease
wounds
desertions
and
death
it
became
necessary
to
consolidate
them
and
the
social
pleasures
received
another
blow
men
from
the
same
neighborhoods
and
villages
who
had
been
schoolmates
together
were
no
longer
in
companies
but
mingled
indiscriminately
with
all
sorts
of
men
from
anywhere
and
everywhere
those
who
have
not
served
in
the
army
as
privates
can
form
no
idea
of
the
extent
to
which
such
changes
as
those
just
mentioned
affect
the
spirits
and
general
worth
of
a
soldier
men
who
when
surrounded
by
their
old
companions
were
brave
and
daring
soldiers
full
of
spirit
and
hope
when
thrust
among
strangers
for
whom
they
cared
not
and
who
cared
not
for
them
became
dull
and
listless
lost
their
courage
and
were
slowly
but
surely
demoralized
they
did
it
is
true
in
many
cases
stand
up
to
the
last
but
they
did
it
on
dry
principle
having
none
of
that
enthusiasm
and
delight
in
duty
which
once
characterized
them
the
confederate
soldier
was
peculiar
in
that
he
was
ever
ready
to
fight
but
never
ready
to
submit
to
the
routine
duty
and
discipline
of
the
camp
or
the
march
the
soldiers
were
determined
to
be
soldiers
after
their
own
notions
and
do
their
duty
for
the
love
of
it
as
they
thought
best
the
officers
saw
the
necessity
for
doing
otherwise
and
so
the
conflict
was
commenced
and
maintained
to
the
end
it
is
doubtful
whether
the
southern
soldier
would
have
submitted
to
any
hardships
which
were
purely
the
result
of
discipline
and
on
the
other
hand
no
amount
of
hardship
clearly
of
necessity
could
cool
his
ardor
and
in
spite
of
all
this
antagonism
between
the
officers
and
men
the
presence
of
conscripts
the
consolidation
of
commands
and
many
other
discouraging
facts
the
privates
in
the
ranks
so
conducted
themselves
that
the
historians
of
the
north
were
forced
to
call
them
the
finest
body
of
infantry
ever
assembled
but
to
know
the
men
we
must
see
them
divested
of
all
their
false
notions
of
soldier
life
and
enduring
the
incomparable
hardships
which
marked
the
latter
half
of
the
war
chapter
iv
on
the
march
it
is
a
common
mistake
of
those
who
write
on
subjects
familiar
to
themselves
to
omit
the
details
which
to
one
not
so
conversant
with
the
matters
discussed
are
necessary
to
a
clear
appreciation
of
the
meaning
of
the
writer
this
mistake
is
fatal
when
the
writer
lives
and
writes
in
one
age
and
his
readers
live
in
another
and
so
a
soldier
writing
for
the
information
of
the
citizen
should
forget
his
own
familiarity
with
the
scenes
of
soldier
life
and
strive
to
record
even
those
things
which
seem
to
him
too
common
to
mention
who
does
not
know
all
about
the
marching
of
soldiers
those
who
have
never
marched
with
them
and
some
who
have
the
varied
experience
of
thousands
would
not
tell
the
whole
story
of
the
march
every
man
must
be
heard
before
the
story
is
told
and
even
then
the
part
of
those
who
fell
by
the
way
is
wanting
orders
to
move
where
when
what
for
are
the
eager
questions
of
the
men
as
they
begin
their
preparations
to
march
generally
nobody
can
answer
and
the
journey
is
commenced
in
utter
ignorance
of
where
it
is
to
end
but
shrewd
guesses
are
made
and
scraps
of
information
will
be
picked
up
on
the
way
the
main
thought
must
be
to
get
ready
to
move
the
orderly
sergeant
is
shouting
fall
in
and
there
is
no
time
to
lose
the
probability
is
that
before
you
get
your
blanket
rolled
up
find
your
frying
pan
haversack
axe
and
fall
in
the
will
be
over
and
some
extra
duty
provided
illustration
no
wonder
there
is
bustle
in
the
camp
rapid
decisions
are
to
be
made
between
the
various
conveniences
which
have
accumulated
for
some
must
be
left
one
fellow
picks
up
the
skillet
holds
it
awhile
mentally
determining
how
much
it
weighs
and
what
will
be
the
weight
of
it
after
carrying
it
five
miles
and
reluctantly
with
a
sly
look
drops
it
and
takes
his
place
in
ranks
another
having
added
to
his
store
of
blankets
too
freely
now
has
to
decide
which
of
the
two
or
three
he
will
leave
the
old
looks
large
and
heavy
but
one
man
has
taken
it
affectionately
to
his
care
this
is
the
time
to
say
farewell
to
the
breadtray
farewell
to
the
little
piles
of
clean
straw
laid
between
two
logs
where
it
was
so
easy
to
sleep
farewell
to
those
piles
of
wood
cut
with
so
much
labor
farewell
to
the
girls
in
the
neighborhood
farewell
to
the
spring
farewell
to
our
tree
and
our
fire
to
the
fellows
who
are
not
going
and
a
general
to
the
very
hills
and
valleys
soldiers
commonly
threw
away
the
most
valuable
articles
they
possessed
blankets
overcoats
shoes
bread
and
meat
all
gave
way
to
the
necessities
of
the
march
and
what
one
man
threw
away
would
frequently
be
the
very
article
that
another
wanted
and
would
immediately
pick
up
so
there
was
not
much
lost
after
all
the
first
hour
or
so
of
the
march
was
generally
quite
orderly
the
men
preserving
their
places
in
ranks
and
marching
in
solid
column
but
soon
some
lively
fellow
whistles
an
air
somebody
else
starts
a
song
the
whole
column
breaks
out
with
roars
of
laughter
route
step
takes
the
place
of
order
and
the
jolly
singing
laughing
talking
and
joking
that
follows
no
one
could
describe
now
let
any
young
officer
who
sports
a
new
hat
coat
saddle
or
anything
odd
or
fine
dare
to
pass
along
and
how
nicely
he
is
attended
to
the
expressions
of
fun
or
contempt
which
one
regiment
of
infantry
was
capable
of
uttering
in
a
day
for
the
benefit
of
such
would
fill
a
volume
as
one
thing
or
another
in
the
dress
of
the
subject
of
their
remarks
attracted
attention
they
would
shout
come
out
of
that
hat
you
ca
hide
in
thar
come
out
of
that
coat
come
out
there
a
man
in
it
come
out
of
them
boots
the
infantry
seemed
to
know
exactly
what
to
say
to
torment
cavalry
and
artillery
and
generally
said
it
if
any
one
on
the
roadside
was
simple
enough
to
recognize
and
address
by
name
a
man
in
the
ranks
the
whole
column
would
kindly
respond
and
add
all
sorts
of
pleasant
remarks
such
as
halloa
john
here
your
brother
bill
oh
bill
here
your
ma
glad
to
see
you
how
your
grandma
how
d
do
come
out
of
that
shirt
troops
on
the
march
were
generally
so
cheerful
and
gay
that
an
outsider
looking
on
them
as
they
marched
would
hardly
imagine
how
they
suffered
in
summer
time
the
dust
combined
with
the
heat
caused
great
suffering
the
nostrils
of
the
men
filled
with
dust
became
dry
and
feverish
and
even
the
throat
did
not
escape
the
grit
was
felt
between
the
teeth
and
the
eyes
were
rendered
almost
useless
there
was
dust
in
eyes
mouth
ears
and
hair
the
shoes
were
full
of
sand
and
the
dust
penetrating
the
clothes
and
getting
in
at
the
neck
wrists
and
ankles
mixed
with
perspiration
produced
an
irritant
almost
as
active
as
cantharides
the
heat
was
at
times
terrific
but
the
men
became
greatly
accustomed
to
it
and
endured
it
with
wonderful
ease
their
heavy
woolen
clothes
were
a
great
annoyance
tough
linen
or
cotton
clothes
would
have
been
a
great
relief
indeed
there
are
many
objections
to
woolen
clothing
for
soldiers
even
in
winter
the
sun
produced
great
changes
in
the
appearance
of
the
men
their
skins
tanned
to
a
dark
brown
or
red
their
hands
black
almost
and
long
uncut
beard
and
hair
burned
to
a
strange
color
made
them
barely
recognizable
to
the
home
folks
if
the
dust
and
the
heat
were
not
on
hand
to
annoy
their
very
able
substitutes
were
mud
cold
rain
snow
hail
and
wind
took
their
places
rain
was
the
greatest
discomfort
a
soldier
could
have
it
was
more
uncomfortable
than
the
severest
cold
with
clear
weather
wet
clothes
shoes
and
blankets
wet
meat
and
bread
wet
feet
and
wet
ground
wet
wood
to
burn
or
rather
not
to
burn
wet
arms
and
ammunition
wet
ground
to
sleep
on
mud
to
wade
through
swollen
creeks
to
ford
muddy
springs
and
a
thousand
other
discomforts
attended
the
rain
there
was
no
comfort
on
a
rainy
day
or
night
except
in
bed
that
is
under
your
blanket
and
cold
winds
blowing
the
rain
in
the
faces
of
the
men
increased
the
discomfort
mud
was
often
so
deep
as
to
submerge
the
horses
and
mules
and
at
times
it
was
necessary
for
one
man
or
more
to
extricate
another
from
the
mud
holes
in
the
road
night
marching
was
attended
with
additional
discomforts
and
dangers
such
as
falling
off
bridges
stumbling
into
ditches
tearing
the
face
and
injuring
the
eyes
against
the
bushes
and
projecting
limbs
of
trees
and
getting
separated
from
your
own
company
and
hopelessly
lost
in
the
multitude
of
course
a
man
lost
had
no
sympathy
if
he
dared
to
ask
a
question
every
man
in
hearing
would
answer
each
differently
and
then
the
whole
multitude
would
roar
with
laughter
at
the
lost
man
and
ask
him
if
his
mother
knew
he
was
out
very
few
men
had
comfortable
or
fitting
shoes
and
fewer
had
socks
and
as
a
consequence
the
suffering
from
bruised
and
inflamed
feet
was
terrible
it
was
a
common
practice
on
long
marches
for
the
men
to
take
off
their
shoes
and
carry
them
in
their
hands
or
swung
over
the
shoulder
bloody
footprints
in
the
snow
were
not
unknown
to
the
soldiers
of
the
army
of
northern
virginia
when
large
bodies
of
troops
were
moving
on
the
same
road
the
alternate
halt
and
forward
was
very
harassing
every
obstacle
produced
a
halt
and
caused
the
men
at
once
to
sit
and
lie
down
on
the
roadside
where
shade
or
grass
tempted
them
about
the
time
they
got
fixed
they
would
hear
the
word
forward
and
then
have
to
move
at
increased
speed
to
close
up
the
gap
in
the
column
sitting
down
for
a
few
minutes
on
a
long
march
is
pleasant
but
it
does
not
always
pay
when
the
march
is
resumed
the
limbs
are
stiff
and
sore
and
the
man
rather
worsted
by
the
halt
about
noon
on
a
hot
day
some
fellow
with
the
water
instinct
would
determine
in
his
own
mind
that
a
well
was
not
far
ahead
and
start
off
in
a
trot
to
reach
it
before
the
column
of
course
another
and
another
followed
till
a
stream
of
men
were
hurrying
to
the
well
which
was
soon
completely
surrounded
by
a
thirsty
mob
yelling
and
pushing
and
pulling
to
get
to
the
bucket
as
the
windlass
brought
it
again
and
again
to
the
surface
but
their
impatience
and
haste
would
soon
overturn
the
windlass
and
spatter
the
water
all
around
the
well
till
the
whole
crowd
were
wading
in
mud
the
rope
would
break
and
the
bucket
fall
to
the
bottom
but
there
was
a
substitute
for
rope
and
bucket
the
men
would
hasten
away
and
get
long
slim
poles
and
on
them
tie
by
the
straps
a
number
of
canteens
which
they
lowered
into
the
well
and
filled
and
unless
as
was
frequently
the
case
the
whole
lot
slipped
off
and
fell
to
the
bottom
drew
them
to
the
top
and
distributed
them
to
their
owners
who
at
once
threw
their
heads
back
inserted
the
nozzles
in
their
mouths
and
drank
the
last
drop
hastening
at
once
to
rejoin
the
marching
column
leaving
behind
them
a
dismantled
and
dry
well
it
was
in
vain
that
the
officers
tried
to
stop
the
stream
of
men
making
for
the
water
and
equally
vain
to
attempt
to
move
the
crowd
while
a
drop
remained
accessible
many
who
were
thoughtful
carried
full
canteens
to
comrades
in
the
column
who
had
not
been
able
to
get
to
the
well
and
no
one
who
has
not
had
experience
of
it
knows
the
thrill
of
gratification
and
delight
which
those
fellows
felt
when
the
cool
stream
gurgled
from
the
battered
canteen
down
their
parched
throats
illustration
a
well
in
very
hot
weather
when
the
necessities
of
the
service
permitted
there
was
a
halt
about
noon
of
an
hour
or
so
to
rest
the
men
and
give
them
a
chance
to
cool
off
and
get
the
sand
and
gravel
out
of
their
shoes
this
time
was
spent
by
some
in
absolute
repose
but
the
lively
boys
told
many
a
yarn
cracked
many
a
joke
and
sung
many
a
song
between
halt
and
column
forward
some
took
the
opportunity
if
water
was
near
to
bathe
their
feet
hands
and
face
and
nothing
could
be
more
enjoyable
the
passage
of
a
cider
cart
a
barrel
on
wheels
was
a
rare
and
exciting
occurrence
the
rapidity
with
which
a
barrel
of
sweet
cider
was
consumed
would
astonish
any
one
who
saw
it
for
the
first
time
and
generally
the
owner
had
cause
to
wonder
at
the
small
return
in
cash
sometimes
a
desperately
enterprising
darkey
would
approach
the
column
with
a
cartload
of
pies
it
would
be
impossible
to
describe
accurately
the
taste
or
appearance
of
those
pies
they
were
generally
similar
in
appearance
size
and
thickness
to
a
pale
specimen
of
old
virginia
buckwheat
cakes
and
had
a
taste
which
resembled
a
combination
of
rancid
lard
and
crab
apples
it
was
generally
supposed
that
they
contained
dried
apples
and
the
sellers
were
careful
to
state
that
they
had
sugar
in
and
were
mighty
nice
it
was
rarely
the
case
that
any
trace
of
sugar
was
found
but
they
filled
up
a
hungry
man
wonderfully
men
of
sense
and
there
were
many
such
in
the
ranks
were
necessarily
desirous
of
knowing
where
or
how
far
they
were
to
march
and
suffered
greatly
from
a
feeling
of
helpless
ignorance
of
where
they
were
and
whither
bound
whether
to
battle
or
camp
frequently
when
anticipating
the
quiet
and
rest
of
an
ideal
camp
they
were
thrown
weary
and
exhausted
into
the
face
of
a
waiting
enemy
and
at
times
after
anticipating
a
sharp
fight
having
formed
line
of
battle
and
braced
themselves
for
the
coming
danger
suffered
all
the
apprehension
and
got
themselves
in
good
fighting
trim
they
were
marched
off
in
the
driest
and
prosiest
sort
of
style
and
ordered
into
camp
where
in
all
probability
they
had
to
wait
for
the
wagon
and
for
the
bread
and
meat
therein
until
the
proverb
patient
waiting
is
no
loss
lost
all
its
force
and
beauty
occasionally
when
the
column
extended
for
a
mile
or
more
and
the
road
was
one
dense
moving
mass
of
men
a
cheer
would
be
heard
away
ahead
increasing
in
volume
as
it
approached
until
there
was
one
universal
shout
then
some
favorite
general
officer
dashing
by
followed
by
his
staff
would
explain
the
cause
at
other
times
the
same
cheering
and
enthusiasm
would
result
from
the
passage
down
the
column
of
some
obscure
and
despised
officer
who
knew
it
was
all
a
joke
and
looked
mean
and
sheepish
accordingly
but
no
could
produce
more
prolonged
or
hearty
cheers
than
the
old
hare
which
jumped
the
fence
and
invited
the
column
to
a
chase
and
often
it
was
said
when
the
rolling
shout
arose
there
goes
old
general
lee
or
a
molly
cotton
tail
the
men
would
help
each
other
when
in
real
distress
but
their
delight
was
to
torment
any
one
who
was
unfortunate
in
a
ridiculous
way
if
for
instance
a
piece
of
artillery
was
fast
in
the
mud
the
infantry
and
cavalry
passing
around
the
obstruction
would
rack
their
brains
for
words
and
phrases
applicable
to
the
situation
and
most
calculated
to
worry
the
cannoniers
who
waist
deep
in
the
mud
were
tugging
at
the
wheels
brass
bands
at
first
quite
numerous
and
good
became
very
rare
and
their
music
very
poor
in
the
latter
years
of
the
war
it
was
a
fine
thing
to
see
the
fellows
trying
to
keep
the
music
going
as
they
waded
through
the
mud
but
poor
as
the
music
was
it
helped
the
footsore
and
weary
to
make
another
mile
and
encouraged
a
cheer
and
a
brisker
step
from
the
lagging
and
tired
column
as
the
men
tired
there
was
less
and
less
talking
until
the
whole
mass
became
quiet
and
serious
each
man
was
occupied
with
his
own
thoughts
for
miles
nothing
could
be
heard
but
the
steady
tramp
of
the
men
the
rattling
and
jingling
of
canteens
and
accoutrements
and
the
occasional
close
up
men
close
up
of
the
officers
the
most
refreshing
incidents
of
the
march
occurred
when
the
column
entered
some
clean
and
cosy
village
where
the
people
loved
the
troops
matron
and
maid
vied
with
each
other
in
their
efforts
to
express
their
devotion
to
the
defenders
of
their
cause
remembering
with
tearful
eyes
the
absent
soldier
brother
or
husband
they
yet
smiled
through
their
tears
and
with
hearts
and
voices
welcomed
the
coming
of
the
troops
their
scanty
larders
poured
out
the
last
morsel

a
close
observer
would
easily
detect
the
seriousness
of
the
man
who
asked
after

he
spoke

cooking

rations
in

were
alternately
superabundant

the
issue
as

composition
that
the

became
in
large
measure
independent
of
this
seeming
absolute
necessity
and
by
some
mysterious
means
known
only
to
purely
patriotic
soldiers
learned
to
fight
without

to
find
subsistence

the

was
not

there
were
times
when

soldier
in

was
fortunate
when
he
had
his

all
at

in

when
he
raised
the
lid
of
the
oven
and
exposed
the
tops

the

animosity
subsided
the
full
of

then
became
the

as
the

sopped
his

his
poor
pinched
countenance
wrinkled
into
a
smile
and
his
sunken

glistened
with
delight

the
coffee
too
how
delicious
the
aroma
of
it
and
how
readily
each
man
disposed
of
a
quart
the
strong
men
gathered
round
chuckling
at
their
good
luck
and
cooing
like
a
child
with
a
big
piece
of
cake
ah
this
was
a
sight

such
was
a
meal
when
the
mess
was
fortunate
how
different
when
the
wagons
have
not
been
heard
from
for
hours
now
the
question
is
how
to
do
the
largest
amount
of
good
to
the
largest
number
with
the
smallest
amount
of
material
the
most
experienced
men
discuss
the
situation
and
decide
that
somebody
must
go
foraging
though
the
stock
on
hand
is
small
no
one
seems
anxious
to
leave
the
small
certainty
and
go
in
search
of
the
large
uncertainty
of
supper
from
some
farmer
table
but
at
last
several
comrades
start
out
and
as
they
disappear
the
preparations
for
immediate
consumption
commence
the
meat
is
too
little
to
cook
alone
and
the
flour
will
scarcely
make
six
biscuits
the
result
is
that
slosh
or
coosh
must
do
so
the
bacon
is
fried
out
till
the
pan
is
half
full
of
boiling
grease
the
flour
is
mixed
with
water
until
it
flows
like
milk
poured
into
the
grease
and
rapidly
stirred
till
the
whole
is
a
dirty
brown
mixture
it
is
now
ready
to
be
served
perhaps
some
dainty
fellow
prefers
the
more
imposing
slapjack
if
so
the
flour
is
mixed
with
less
water
the
grease
reduced
and
the
paste
poured
in
till
it
covers
the
bottom
of
the
pan
and
when
brown
on
the
underside
is
by
a
nimble
twist
of
the
pan
turned
and
browned
again
if
there
is
any
sugar
in
camp
it
makes
a
delicious
addition
about
the
time
the
last
scrap
of
slapjack
and
the
last
spoonful
of
slosh
are
disposed
of
the
unhappy
foragers
return
they
take
in
the
situation
at
a
glance
realize
with
painful
distinctness
that
they
have
sacrificed
the
homely
slosh
for
the
vain
expectancy
of
apple
butter
shortcake
and
milk
and
with
woeful
countenance
and
mournful
voice
narrate
their
adventure
and
disappointment
thus
well
boys
we
have
done
the
best
we
could
we
have
walked
about
nine
miles
over
the
mountain
and
have
found
a
mouthful
to
eat
sorry
but
it
a
fact
give
us
our
biscuits
of
course
there
are
none
and
as
it
is
not
contrary
to
army
etiquette
to
do
so
the
whole
mess
professes
to
be
very
sorry
sometimes
however
the
foragers
returned
well
laden
with
good
things
and
as
good
comrades
should
shared
the
fruits
of
their
toilsome
hunt
with
their
comrades
foragers
thought
it
not
indelicate
to
linger
about
the
house
of
the
unsuspecting
farmer
till
the
lamp
revealed
the
family
at
supper
and
then
modestly
approach
and
knock
at
the
door
as
the
man
knew
that
his
guests
were
posted
about
the
meal
in
progress
in
the
next
room
the
invitation
to
supper
was
given
and
shall
i
say
it
accepted
with
an
unbecoming
lack
of
reluctance
the
following
illustrates
the
ingenuity
of
the
average
forager
there
was
great
scarcity
of
meat
and
no
prospect
of
a
supply
from
the
wagons
two
experienced
foragers
were
sent
out
and
as
a
farmer
about
ten
miles
from
the
camp
was
killing
hogs
guided
by
soldier
instinct
they
went
directly
to
his
house
and
found
the
meat
nicely
cut
up
the
various
pieces
of
each
hog
making
a
separate
pile
on
the
floor
of
an
outhouse
the
proposition
to
buy
met
with
a
surprisingly
ready
response
on
the
part
of
the
farmer
he
offered
one
entire
pile
of
meat
being
one
whole
hog
for
such
a
small
sum
that
the
foragers
instantly
closed
the
bargain
and
as
promptly
opened
their
eyes
to
the
danger
which
menaced
them
they
gave
the
old
gentleman
a
bill
and
requested
change
pleased
with
their
honest
method
he
hastened
away
to
his
house
to
obtain
it
the
two
honest
foragers
hastily
examined
the
particular
pile
of
pork
which
the
farmer
designated
as
theirs
found
it
very
rank
and
totally
unfit
for
food
transferred
half
of
it
to
another
pile
from
which
they
took
half
and
added
to
theirs
and
awaited
the
return
of
the
farmer
on
giving
them
their
change
he
assured
them
that
they
had
a
bargain
they
agreed
that
they
had
tossed
good
and
bad
together
in
a
bag
said
and
departed
as
rapidly
as
artillerymen
on
foot
can
the
result
of
the
trip
was
a
of
large
dimensions
and
some
six
or
eight
men
gorged
with
fat
pork
declared
that
they
had
never
cared
for
and
would
not
again
wish
to
eat
pork
especially
a
large
proportion
of
the
eating
of
the
army
was
done
in
the
houses
and
at
the
tables
of
the
people
not
by
the
use
of
force
but
by
the
wish
and
invitation
of
the
people
it
was
at
times
necessary
that
whole
towns
should
help
to
sustain
the
army
of
defense
and
when
this
was
the
case
it
was
done
voluntarily
and
cheerfully
the
soldiers
all
who
conducted
themselves
properly
were
received
as
honored
guests
and
given
the
best
in
the
house
there
was
a
wonderful
absence
of
stealing
or
plundering
and
even
when
the
people
suffered
from
depredation
they
attributed
the
cause
to
terrible
necessity
rather
than
to
wanton
disregard
of
the
rights
of
property
and
when
armed
guards
were
placed
over
the
and
barns
it
was
not
so
much
because
the
commanding
general
doubted
the
honesty
as
that
he
knew
the
necessities
of
his
troops
but
even
pinching
hunger
was
not
held
to
be
an
excuse
for
marauding
expeditions
the
inability
of
the
government
to
furnish
supplies
forced
the
men
to
depend
largely
upon
their
own
energy
and
ingenuity
to
obtain
them
the
officers
knowing
this
relaxed
discipline
to
an
extent
which
would
seem
to
a
european
officer
for
instance
ruinous
it
was
no
uncommon
sight
to
see
a
brigade
or
division
which
was
but
a
moment
before
marching
in
solid
column
along
the
road
scattered
over
an
immense
field
searching
for
the
luscious
blackberries
and
it
was
wonderful
to
see
how
promptly
and
cheerfully
all
returned
to
the
ranks
when
the
field
was
gleaned
in
the
fall
of
the
year
a
persimmon
tree
on
the
roadside
would
halt
a
column
and
detain
it
till
the
last
persimmon
disappeared
the
sutler
wagon
loaded
with
luxuries
which
was
so
common
in
the
federal
army
was
unknown
in
the
army
of
northern
virginia
for
two
reasons
the
men
had
no
money
to
buy
sutlers
stores
and
the
country
no
men
to
spare
for
sutlers
the
nearest
approach
to
the
sutler
wagon
was
the
cider
cart
of
some
old
darkey
or
a
basket
of
pies
and
cakes
displayed
on
the
roadside
for
sale
the
confederate
soldier
relied
greatly
upon
the
abundant
supplies
of
eatables
which
the
enemy
was
kind
enough
to
bring
him
and
he
cheerfully
risked
his
life
for
the
accomplishment
of
the
twofold
purpose
of
whipping
the
enemy
and
getting
what
he
called
a
square
meal
after
a
battle
there
was
general
feasting
on
the
confederate
side
good
things
scarcely
ever
seen
at
other
times
filled
the
haversacks
and
the
stomachs
of
the
boys
in
gray
imagine
the
feelings
of
men
half
famished
when
they
rush
into
a
camp
at
one
side
while
the
enemy
flees
from
the
other
and
find

and
in

everything
a
hungry

craves
then
add
the
liquors

cigars
and
tobacco
found
in
the
tents
of
the
officers
and
the
wagons
of
the
sutlers
and
remembering
the
condition
of
the
victorious
party
hungry
thirsty
and
weary
say
if
it
did
not
require
wonderful
devotion
to
duty
and
great
to
push
on
trampling
under
foot
the
plunder
of
the
camp
and
pursue
the
enemy
till
the
sun
went
down
when
it
was
allowable
to
halt
what
a
glorious
time
it
was
men
who
a
moment
before
would
have
been
delighted
with
a
pone
of
cornbread
and
a
piece
of

meat
discuss
the
comparative
merits
of
peaches
and

and

tomatoes

roast
beef
and

the
vicissitudes
of

life
snuff
the
aroma
of
imported
havanas
in
sharp
contrast
with
the
at
the
big
fire
was
the
serious
and
diligent
work
of
the
man
separated
from
his
comrades
out
of
reach
of
the
woods
but
bent
on
cooking
and
eating
he
has
found
a
coal
of
fire
and
having
placed
over
it
in
an
ingenious
manner
the
few
leaves
and
twigs
near
his
post
he
fans
the
little
pile
with
his
hat
it
soon
blazes
fearing
the
utter
consumption
of
his
fuel
he
hastens
to
balance
on
the
little
fire
his
tin
cup
of
water
when
it
boils
from
some
secure
place
in
his
clothes
he
takes
a
little
coffee
and
drops
it
in
the
cup
and
almost
instantly
the
cup
is
removed
and
set
aside
then
a
slice
of
fat
meat
is
laid
on
the
coals
and
when
brown
and
crisp
completes
the
meal
for
the
crackers
or
biscuit
are
ready
no
one
but
a
soldier
would
have
undertaken
to
cook
with
such
a
fire
as
frequently
it
was
no
bigger
than
a
quart
cup
crackers
or
hard
tack
as
they
were
called
are
notoriously
poor
eating
but
in
the
hands
of
the
confederate
soldier
were
made
to
do
good
duty
when
on
the
march
and
pressed
for
time
a
piece
of
solid
fat
pork
and
a
dry
cracker
was
passable
or
luscious
as
the
time
was
long
or
short
since
the
last
meal
when
there
was
leisure
to
do
it
hardtack
was
soaked
well
and
then
fried
in
bacon
grease
prepared
thus
it
was
a
dish
which
no
confederate
had
the
weakness
or
the
strength
to
refuse
sorghum
in
the
absence
of
the
better
molasses
of
peace
times
was
greatly
prized
and
eagerly
sought
after
a
union
man
living
near
the
confederate
lines
was
one
day
busy
boiling
his
crop
naturally
enough
some
of
our
boys
smelt
out
the
place
and
determined
to
have
some
of
the
sweet
fluid
they
had
found
a
yearling
dead
in
the
field
hard
by
and
in
thinking
over
the
matter
determined
to
sell
the
union
man
if
possible
so
they
cut
from
the
dead
animal
a
choice
piece
of
beef
carried
it
to
the
old
fellow
and
offered
to
trade
he
accepted
the
offer
and
the
whole
party
walked
off
with
canteens
full
artillerymen
having
tender
consciences
and
no
muskets
seldom
if
ever
shot
stray
pigs
but
they
did
sometimes
as
an
act
of
friendship
wholly
disinterested
point
out
to
the
infantry
a
pig
which
seemed
to
need
shooting
and
by
way
of
dividing
the
danger
and
responsibility
of
the
act
accept
privately
a
choice
part
of
the
deceased
on
one
occasion
when
a
civilian
was
dining
with
the
mess
there
was
a
fine
pig
for
dinner
this
circumstance
caused
the
civilian
to
remark
on
the
good
fare
the
forager
replied
that
pig
was
an
uncommon
dish
this
one
having
been
kicked
by
one
of
the
battery
horses
while
stealing
corn
and
instantly
killed
the
civilian
seemed
to
doubt
the
statement
after
his
teeth
had
come
down
hard
on
a
pistol
bullet
and
continued
to
doubt
though
assured
that
it
was
the
head
of
a
nail
the
most
melancholy
eating
a
soldier
was
ever
forced
to
do
was
when
pinched
with
hunger
cold
wet
and
dejected
he
wandered
over
the
deserted
field
of
battle
and
satisfied
his
cravings
with
the
contents
of
the
haversacks
of
the
dead
if
there
is
anything
which
will
overcome
the
natural
abhorrence
which
a
man
feels
for
the
enemy
the
loathing
of
the
bloated
dead
and
the
awe
engendered
by
the
presence
of
death
solitude
and
silence
it
is
hunger
impelled
by
its
clamoring
men
of
high
principle
and
tenderest
humanity
become
for
the
time
void
of
sensibility
and
condescend
to
acts
which
though
justified
by
their
extremity
seem
afterwards
even
to
the
doers
too
shameless
to
mention
when
rations
became
so
very
small
that
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
supplement
them
and
the
camp
was
permanently
established
those
men
who
had
the
physical
ability
worked
for
the
neighborhood
farmers
at
cutting
harvesting
the
crops
killing
hogs
or
any
other
a
stout
man
would
cut
a
cord
of
wood
a
day
and
receive
fifty
cents
in
money
or
its
equivalent
in
something
eatable
hogs
were
slaughtered
for
the
fifth
quarter
when
the
corn
became
large
enough
to
eat
the
roasting
ears
thrown
in
the
ashes
with
the
shucks
on
and
nicely
roasted
made
a
grateful
meal
turnip
and
onion
patches
also
furnished
delightful
and
food
good
raw
or
cooked
occasionally
when
a
mess
was
hard
pushed
for
eatables
it
became
necessary
to
resort
to
some
ingenious
method
of
disgusting
a
part
of
the
mess
that
the
others
might
eat
their
fill
the
pepper
treatment
was
a
common
method
practiced
with
the
soup
which
once
failed
a
shrewd
fellow
who
loved
things
hot
decided
to
have
plenty
of
soup
and
to
accomplish
his
purpose
as
he
passed
and
repassed
the
boiling
pot
dropped
in
a
pod
of
red
pepper
but
alas
for
him
there
was
another
man
like
minded
who
adopted
the
same
plan
and
the
result
was
that
all
the
mess
waited
in
vain
for
that
pot
of
soup
to
cool
the
individual
of
one
man
in
the
army
of
northern
virginia
was
always
kept
at
the
boiling
point
the
owner
of
it
was
an
enigma
to
his
comrades
they
could
not
understand
his
strange
fondness
for
coffee
since
the
war
he
has
explained
that
he
found
the
heat
of
the
coffee
prevented
its
use
by
others
and
adopted
the
plan
of
placing
his
cup
on
the
fire
after
every
sip
this
same
character
never
troubled
himself
to
carry
a
canteen
though
a
great
water
drinker
when
he
found
a
good
canteen
he
would
kindly
give
it
to
a
comrade
reserving
the
privilege
of
an
occasional
drink
when
in
need
he
soon
had
an
interest
in
thirty
or
forty
canteens
and
their
contents
and
could
always
get
a
drink
of
water
if
it
was
to
be
found
in
any
of
them
he
pursued
the
same
plan
with
blankets
and
always
had
plenty
in
that
line
his
entire
outfit
was
the
clothes
on
his
back
and
a
haversack
accurately
shaped
to
hold
one
half
pone
of
corn
bread
time
was
a
trying
time
for
the
hungry
private
having
been
fed
during
the
whole
of
the
winter
on
salt
meat
and
coarse
bread
his
system
craved
the
fresh
luscious
juice
of
the
corn
and
at
times
his
honesty
gave
way
under
the
pressure
how
could
he
resist
he
did
he
took
some
roasting
ears
sometimes
the
farmer
grumbled
sometimes
he
quarreled
and
sometimes
he
complained
to
the
officers
of
the
depredations
of
the
men
the
officers
apologized
ate
what
corn
they
had
on
hand
and
sent
their
boy
for
some
more
one
old
farmer
conceived
the
happy
plan
of
inviting
some
privates
to
his
house
stating
his
grievances
and
securing
their
co√∂peration
in
the
effort
to
protect
his
corn
he
told
them
that
of
course
were
not
the
who
took
his
corn
oh
no
of
course
would
not
do
such
a
thing
but
would
they
please
speak
to
the
others
and
ask
them
please
not
to
take
his
corn
of
course
certainly
oh
yes
they
would
remonstrate
with
their
comrades
how
they
burned
though
as
they
thought
of
the
past
and
contemplated
the
near
future
as
they
returned
to
camp
through
the
field
they
filled
their
haversacks
with
the
silky
ears
and
were
met
on
the
other
side
of
the
field
by
the
kind
farmer
and
a
file
of
men
who
were
only
too
eager
to
secure
the
plucked
corn
in
the
line
of
duty
a
faithful
officer
worn
out
with
the
long
weary
march
sick
hungry
and
dejected
leaned
his
back
against
a
tree
and
groaned
to
think
of
his
inability
to
join
in
the
chase
of
an
old
hare
which
he
knew
from
the
wild
yells
in
the
wood
his
men
were
pursuing
but
the
uproar
approached
him
nearer
nearer
and
nearer
until
he
saw
the
hare
bounding
towards
him
with
a
regiment
at
her
heels
she
spied
an
opening
made
by
the
folds
of
the
officer
cloak
and
jumped
in
and
he
embraced
his
first
meal
for
hours
an
artilleryman
camped
for
a
day
where
no
water
was
to
be
found
easily
awakened
during
the
night
by
thirst
went
stumbling
about
in
search
of
water
and
to
his
great
delight
found
a
large
bucketful
he
drank
his
fill
and
in
the
morning
found
that
what
he
drank
had
washed
a
bullock
head
and
was
crimson
with
its
blood
some
stragglers
came
up
one
night
and
found
the
camp
silent
all
hands
asleep
being
hungry
they
sought
and
to
their
great
delight
found
a
large
pot
of
soup
it
had
a
peculiar
taste
but
they
worried
it
down
and
in
the
morning
bragged
of
their
good
fortune
the
soup
had
defied
the
stomachs
of
the
whole
battery
being
strongly
impregnated
with
the
peculiar
flavor
of
defunct
cockroaches
shortly
before
the
evacuation
of
petersburg
a
country
boy
went
hunting
he
killed
and
brought
to
camp
a
muskrat
it
was
skinned
cleaned
buried
a
day
or
two
disinterred
cooked
and
eaten
with
great
relish
it
was
splendid
during
the
seven
days
battles
around
richmond
a
studious
private
observed
the
rats
as
they
entered
and
emerged
from
a
he
killed
one
cooked
it
privately
and
invited
a
friend
to
join
him
in
eating
a
fine
squirrel
the
comrade
consented
ate
heartily
and
when
told
what
he
had
eaten
forthwith
disgorged
but
he
confesses
that
up
to
the
time
when
he
was
enlightened
he
had
greatly
enjoyed
the
meal
it
was
at
this
time
when
rats
were
a
delicacy
that
the
troops
around
richmond
agreed
to
divide
their
rations
with
the
poor
of
the
city
and
they
were
actually
hauled
in
and
distributed
comment
here
would
be
like
complimenting
the
sun
on
its
brilliancy
orators

and

comforts
conveniences
and
consolations
have
you
ever
been
a
soldier
no
then
you
do
not
know
what
comforts
are
conveniences
you
never
had
animal
consolations
never
you
have
not
enjoyed
the
great
exceptional
luxuries
which
once
in
a
century
perhaps
bless
a
limited
number
of
men
how
sad
that
you
have
allowed
your
opportunity
to
pass
unimproved
but
you
been
a
soldier
ah
then
let
us
together
recall
with
pleasure
the
past
once
more
be
hungry
and
eat
once
more
tired
and
rest
once
more
thirsty
and
drink
once
more
cold
and
wet
let
us
sit
by
the
roaring
fire
and
feel
comfort
creep
over
us
so
is
it
very
pleasant
now
let
us
recount
repossess
rather
the
treasures
which
once
were
ours
not
forgetting
that
values
have
shrunk
and
that
the
times
have
changed
and
that
men
also
are
changed
some
happily
some
woefully
possibly
we
also
are
somewhat
modified
eating
you
will
remember
was
more
than
a
convenience
it
was
a
comfort
which
rose
almost
to
the
height
of
a
consolation
probably
the
most
universally
desired
comfort
of
the
confederate
soldier
was
something
to
eat
but
this
like
all
greatly
desired
blessings
was
shy
and
when
obtained
was
to
the
average
seeker
not
replete
with
satisfaction
but
he
did
eat
at
times
with
great
energy
great
endurance
great
capacity
and
great
satisfaction
the
luscious
slapjack
sweetened
perhaps
with
sorghum
the
yellow
and
odoriferous
or
it
might
chance
to
be
the
faithful
hardtack
which
our
friends
the
enemy
called
crackers
serving
in
rotation
as
bread
the
faithful
hog
was
everywhere
represented
his
cheering
presence
was
manifested
most
agreeably
by
the
sweet
odors
flung
to
the
breeze
from
the
that
never
failing
and
always
reliable
utensil
the
solid
slices
of
streaked
lean
and
fat
the
limpid
gravy
the
brown
pan
of
slosh
inviting
you
to
sop
it
and
the
rare
delicate
shortness
of
the
biscuit
made
the
homely
animal
to
be
in
high
esteem
beef
glorious
beef
how
seldom
were
you
seen
and
how
welcome
was
your
presence
in
the
generous
pot
you
parted
with
your
mysterious
strength
and
sweetness
impaled
upon
the
cruel
ramrod
you
suffered
slow
torture
over
the
fire
sliced
chopped
and
pounded
boiled
stewed
fried
or
broiled
always
a
trusty
friend
and
sweet
comforter
happy
the
fire
where
the
stray
pig
found
a
lover
and
unhappy
the
pig
innocence
and
youth
were
no
protection
to
him
and
his
cries
of
distress
availed
him
not
as
against
the
cruel
purpose
of
the
rude
soldiery
what
is
that
faint
aroma
which
steals
about
on
the
night
air
is
it
a
celestial
breeze
no
it
is
the
mist
of
the
do
you
not
hear
the
tumult
of
the
tumbling
water
poor
man
you
have
eaten
and
now
other
joys
press
upon
you
drink
drink
more
near
the
bottom
it
is
sweeter
providence
hath
now
joined
together
for
you
the
bitter
and
the
sweet
there
is
sugar
in
that
cup
some
poor
fellows
after
eating
could
only
sleep
they
were
incapable
of
the
noble
satisfaction
of
a
good
smoke
but
there
were
some
good
men
and
true
thoughtful
men
quietly
disposed
men
gentle
and
kind
who
next
to
a
good
square
meal
prized
a
smoke
possibly
here
begins
consolation
who
can
find
words
to
tell
the
story
of
the
affection
for
his
faithful
pipe
as
the
cloudy
incense
of
the
weed
rises
in
circling
wreaths
about
his
head
as
he
hears
the
murmuring
of
the
fire
and
watches
the
glowing
and
fading
of
the
embers
and
feels
the
comfort
of
the
hour
pervading
his
mortal
frame
what
bliss
but
yonder
sits
a
man
who
scorns
the
pipe
and
why
he
is
a
chewer
of
the
weed
to
him
the
sweetness
of
it
seems
not
to
be
drawn
out
by
the
fiery
test
but
rather
by
the
persuasion
of
moisture
and
pressure
but
he
too
is
under
the
spell
there
are
pictures
in
the
fire
for
him
also
and
he
watches
them
come
and
go
now
draw
near
are
not
those
cheerful
voices
do
you
not
hear
the
contented
tones
of
men
sitting
in
a
cosy
home
what
glowing
hopes
here
leap
out
in
rapid
words
no
bitterness
of
hate
no
revenge
no
cruel
purpose
but
simply
the
firm
resolve
to
march
in
the
front
of
their
country
defenders
would
you
hear
a
song
you
shall
for
even
now
they
sing
aha
a
song
for
the
trumpet
tongue
for
the
bugle
to
sing
before
us
when
our
gleaming
guns
like
clarions
shall
thunder
in
battle
chorus
would
you
hear
a
soldier
prayer
well
there
kneels
one
behind
that
tree
but
he
talks
with
god
you
may
not
hear
him
nor
i
but
now
there
they
go
one
by
one
no
two
by
two
down
goes
an
old
rubber
blanket
and
then
a
good
thick
woolen
one
probably
with
a
big
in
the
centre
of
it
down
go
two
men
they
are
hidden
under
another
of
the
blankets
they
are
resting
their
heads
on
their
old
battered
haversacks
they
love
each
other
to
the
death
those
men
and
sleep
there
like
little
children
locked
in
close
embrace
they
are
asleep
now
no
not
quite
they
are
thinking
of
home
and
it
may
be
of
heaven
but
now
surely
they
are
asleep
no
they
are
not
quite
asleep
they
are
falling
off
to
sleep
happy
soldiers
they
are
asleep
at
early
dawn
the
bugle
sounds
the
reveille
shout
answers
to
shout
the
roll
is
called
and
the
day
begins
what
new
joys
will
it
bring
let
us
stay
and
see
the
sun
gladdens
the
landscape
the
fresh
air
dashing
and
whirling
over
the
fields
and
through
the
pines
is
almost
intoxicating
here
are
noble
ready
for
the
axe
and
the
fire
and
there
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
a
mossy
spring
the
oven
sits
enthroned
on
glowing
coals
crowned
with
fire
the
coffee
boils
the
meat
fries
the
soldier
smiles
and
waits
but
waiting
is
so
very
trying
that
some
seizing
towels
soap
and
comb
from
their
haversacks
step
briskly
down
the
hill
and
plunge
their
heads
into
the
cool
water
of
the
brook
then
their
cheeks
glow
with
rich
color
and
chatting
merrily
they
seek
again
the
fire
carrying
the
old
bucket
brimming
full
of
water
for
the
mess
all
hands
welcome
the
bucket
and
breakfast
begins
now
see
the
value
of
a
good
what
a
treasure
that
tin
cup
is
and
that
old
fork
who
would
have
a
more
comfortable
seat
than
that
log
affords
but
here
comes
the
mail
papers
letters
packages
here
comes
news
from
home
sweet
tender
tearful
hopeful
sad
distressing
news
joyful
news
of
victory
and
sad
news
of
defeat
pictures
of
happy
homes
or
sad
wailing
over
homes
destroyed
but
the
mail
has
arrived
and
we
can
not
change
the
burden
it
has
brought
we
can
only
pity
the
man
who
goes
empty
away
from
the
little
group
assembled
about
the
and
rejoice
with
him
who
strolls
away
with
a
letter
near
his
heart
suppose
he
finds
therein
the
picture
of
a
curly
head
just
four
years
old
suppose
the
last
word
in
it
is
mother
or
suppose
it
concludes
with
a
signature
having
that
peculiarly
helpless
but
courageous
and
hopeful
air
which
can
be
imparted
only
by
the
hand
of
a
girl
whose
heart
goes
with
the
letter
once
more
happy
happy
soldier
the
artilleryman
tarrying
for
a
day
only
in
a
camp
had
only
time
to
eat
and
do
his
work
drill
watering
the
horses
greasing
caissons
and
cleaning
repairing
and
greasing
harness
cleaning
the
chests
of
the
limbers
and
caissons
storing
and
arranging
ammunition
and
many
little
duties
filled
the
day
in
the
midst
of
a
campaign
comfortable
arrangements
for
staying
were
hardly
completed
by
the
time
the
bugle
sounded
the
assembly
and
orders
to
move
were
given
but
however
short
the
stay
might
be
the
departure
always
partook
of
the
nature
of
a
move
from
home
more
especially
was
this
true
in
the
case
of
the
sick
man
whose
weary
body
was
finding
needed
rest
in
the
camp
and
peculiarly
true
of
the
man
who
had
fed
at
the
table
of
a
hospitable
neighbor
and
for
a
day
perhaps
enjoyed
the
society
of
the
fair
daughters
of
the
house
orders
to
move
were
frequently
heralded
by
the
presence
of
the
courier
a
man
who
rarely
knew
a
word
of
the
orders
he
had
brought
who
was
always
besieged
with
innumerable
questions
always
tried
to
appear
to
know
more
than
his
position
allowed
him
to
disclose
and
who
never
ceased
to
be
an
object
of
interest
to
every
camp
he
entered
many
a
gallant
fellow
rode
the
country
over
many
a
one
led
in
the
thickest
of
the
fight
and
died
bravely
known
only
as
my
courier
when
the
leaves
began
to
fall
and
the
wind
to
rush
in
furious
frolics
through
the
woods
the
soldier
heart
yearned
for
comfort
chilling
rains
cutting
sleet
drifting
snow
muddy
roads
all
the
miseries
of
approaching
winter
pressed
him
to
ask
and
repeat
the
question
when
will
we
go
into
winter
quarters
after
all
the
time
did
come
but
first
the
place
was
known
the
time
was
always
doubtful
leisurely
and
steady
movement
towards
the
place
might
be
called
the
first
comfort
of
winter
quarters
and
as
each
day
march
brought
the
column
nearer
the
appointed
camp
the
anticipated
pleasures
assumed
almost
the
sweetness
of
present
enjoyment
but
at
last
comes
the
welcome
left
into
park
and
the
fence
goes
down
the
first
piece
wheels
through
the
gap
the
battery
is
parked
the
horses
are
turned
over
to
the
horse
sergeant
the
old
guns
are
snugly
stowed
under
the
tarpaulins
and
the
winter
has
commenced
the
woods
soon
resound
with
the
ring
of
the
axe
trees
rush
down
crashing
and
snapping
to
the
ground
fires
start
here
and
there
till
the
woods
are
illuminated
and
the
brightest
happiest
busiest
night
of
all
the
year
falls
upon
the
camp
now
around
each
fire
gathers
the
little
group
who
are
for
a
while
to
make
it
the
centre
of
operations
hasty
plans
for
comfort
and
convenience
are
eagerly
discussed
till
late
into
the
night
and
await
only
the
dawn
of
another
day
for
execution
over
and
breakfast
eaten
the
work
of
the
day
commences
with
the
preparation
of
comfortable
sleeping
places
varying
according
to
the
material
on
hand
a
favorite
arrangement
for
two
men
consisted
of
a
bed
of
clean
straw
between
the
halves
of
a
large
oak
log
covered
in
the
event
of
rain
with
a
rubber
blanket
the
more
ambitious
builders
made
straw
pens
several
logs
high
and
pitched
over
these
a
adding
sometimes
a
chimney
in
this
structure
by
the
aid
of
a
bountiful
supply
of
dry
clean
straw
and
their
blankets
the
occupants
bade
defiance
to
cold
rain
and
snow
other
men
gifted
with
that
strange
facility
for
comfort
without
work
which
characterizes
some
people
found
ready
made
they
managed
to
steal
away
night
after
night
and
sleep
in
the
sweet
security
of
a
haystack
a
barn
a
stable
a
porch
or
if
fortune
favored
them
in
some
farmer
feather
bed
others
still
but
more
especially
the
infantry
and
cavalry
built
shelters
open
to
the
south
covered
them
with
and
brush
built
a
huge
fire
in
front
and
made
themselves
at
home
for
a
season
but
all
these
things
were
mere
temporary
occupying
about
the
same
relation
to
winter
quarters
as
the
does
to
a
happy
and
comfortable
home
during
the
occupancy
of
these
and
while
the
work
of
building
was
progressing
the
confederate
soldier
wrote
many
letters
home
he
saw
an
opportunity
for
enjoyment
ahead
and
tried
to
improve
it
his
letters
were
somewhat
after
the
following
order
camp
near
williams
mill
dear
father

no
doubt
be
glad
to
hear

though
we
arrived
here
only
two
days
ago
we
are
working
constantly
on
our
log
cabins
and
hope
to
be
in
them

are
near
the
railroad
and
anything

willing
to
part
with
forever
underclothing
of
any
sort
shirts
drawers
socks
cotton
or
woollen
would
be
very
very
acceptable
as
it
is
much
less
trouble
to
put
on
the
clean
and
throw
away
the
soiled
clothes
than
to
wash
them
some
coffee
roasted
and
ground
with
sugar
to
match
and
good
to
would
do
to
fill
up
do
not
imagine
however
that
we
are
suffering
or
unhappy
our
only
concern
is
for
all
at
home
and
if
compliance
with
the
above
requests
would
cost
you
the
slightest
at
home
we
would
rather
withdraw
them
why
do
and
go
into
the
army
they
are
old
enough
hearty
enough
able
to
provide
themselves
with
every
comfort
and
ought
to
be
here
many
furloughs
will
be
granted
during
the
winter
and
we
may
get
home
some
of
us
before
another
month
is
past
love
to
mother
dear
mother
and
to
sister
and
tell
them
we
are
happy
and
contented
write
as
soon
as
you
can
and
believe
me
your
affectionate
son
do
forget
the
tobacco
and
now
another
night
comes
to
the
soldier
inviting
him
to
nestle
in
clean
straw
under
dry
blankets
and
sleep
he
will
lay
the
foundation
of
a
village
destined
to
live
till
the
grass
grows
again
he
will
be
architect
builder
and
proprietor
of
a
cosy
cabin
in
the
woods
let
him
sleep
a
pine
wood
of
heavy
original
growth
furnishes
the
ground
and
the
timber
each
company
is
to
have
two
rows
of
houses
with
a
street
between
and
each
street
is
to
end
on
the
main
road
to
the
railroad
depot
the
width
of
the
street
is
decided
it
is
staked
off
each
mess
selects
its
site
for
a
house
and
the
work
commences
the
old
pines
fall
rapidly
under
the
energetic
strokes
of
the
axes
which
glide
into
the
hearts
of
the
trees
with
a
malicious
and
cruel
willingness
the
logs
are
cut
into
lengths
notched
and
fitted
one
upon
another
and
the
structure
begins
to
rise
the
builders
stagger
about
here
and
there
under
the
weight
of
the
huge
logs
occasionally
falling
and
rolling
in
the
snow
they
shout
and
whistle
and
sing
and
are
as
merry
as
children
at
play
at
last
the
topmost
log
is
rolled
into
place
and
the
artistic
work
commences
the
riving
of
slabs
short
logs
of
oak
are
to
be
split
into
huge
shingles
for
the
roof
and
tough
and
tedious
work
it
is
but
it
is
done
the
roof
is
covered
in
and
the
house
is
far
enough
advanced
for
occupancy
now
the
bunks
which
are
simply
broad
shelves
one
above
another
wide
enough
to
accommodate
two
men
spoon
fashion
are
built
merry
parties
sally
forth
to
seek
the
straw
stack
of
the
genial
farmer
of
the
period
and
returning
heavily
laden
with
sweet
clean
straw
bestow
it
in
the
bunks
here
they
rest
for
a
night
next
day
the
chimney
built
like
the
house
of
notched
sticks
or
small
logs
rises
rapidly
till
it
reaches
the
apex
of
the
roof
and
is
crowned
with
a
nail
keg
or
flour
barrel
next
a
pit
is
dug
deep
enough
to
reach
the
clay
water
is
poured
in
and
the
clay
well
mixed
and
the
whole
mess
takes
in
hand
the
daubing
of
the
chinks
every
crack
and
crevice
of
house
and
chimney
receives
attention
at
the
hands
of
the
builders
and
when
the
sun
goes
down
the
house
is
proof
against
the
most
searching
winter
wind
now
the
most
skillful
man
contrives
a
door
and
swings
it
on
its
hinges
another
makes
a
shelf
for
the
old
water
bucket
a
short
bench
or
two
appear
like
magicians
work
before
the
fire
and
the
family
is
settled
for
the
winter
it
would
be
a
vain
man
indeed
who
thought
himself
able
to
describe
the
happy
days
and
cozy
nights
of
that
camp
first
among
the
luxuries
of
settled
life
was
the
opportunity
to
part
forever
with
a
suit
of
underwear
which
had
been
on
constant
duty
for
possibly
three
months
and
put
on
the
sweet
clean
clothes
from
home
they
looked
so
pure
and
the
very
smell
of
them
was
sweet
then
there
was
the
thought
of
a
dry
warm
undisturbed
sleep
the
whole
night
through
what
a
comfort
remember
now
there
is
a
pile
of
splendid
oak
ready
cut
for
the
fire
within
easy
reach
of
the
door
several
cords
of
it
and
it
is
all
ours
our
mess
cut
it
and
toted
it
there
it
will
keep
a
good
fire
night
and
day
for
a
month
the
wagons
which
have
been
over
the
mountains
and
far
away
have
come
into
camp
loaded
with
the
best
flour
in
abundance
droves
of
cattle
are
bellowing
in
the
road
and
our
commissary
as
he
hurries
from
camp
to
camp
with
the
glad
tidings
is
the
embodiment
of
happiness
all
this
means
plenty
to
eat
this
is
a
good
time
to
make
and
carve
beautiful
pipes
of
hard
wood
with
horn
very
comfortable
chairs
bread
trays
haversacks
and
a
thousand
other
conveniences
at
night
the
visiting
commences
and
soon
in
many
huts
are
little
social
groups
close
around
the
fire
the
various
incidents
of
the
campaign
pass
in
review
and
pealing
laughter
rings
out
upon
the
crisp
winter
air
then
a
soft
sweet
melody
floats
out
of
that
cabin
door
as
the
favorite
singer
yields
to
the
entreaty
of
his
little
circle
of
friends
or
a
swelling
chorus
of
manly
voices
chanting
a
grand
and
solemn
anthem
stirs
every
heart
for
half
a
mile
around
now
think
of
an
old
confederate
veteran
who
passed
through
fredericksburg
chancellorsville
and
the
wilderness
sitting
in
front
of
a
cheerful
fire
in
a
snug
log
cabin
reading
say
the
spectator
think
of
another
by
his
side
reading
a
letter
from
his
sweetheart
and
another
still
a
warm
and
yearning
letter
from
his
mother
think
of
two
others
in
the
corner
playing
old
sledge
or
it
may
be
chess
another
off
guard
snoring
in
his
bunk
ah
what
an
amount
of
condensed
contentment
that
little
hut
contains
illustration
an
innocent
victim
and
now
the
stables
are
finished
the
whole
battalion
did
the
work
and
the
poor
old
shivering
and
groaning
horses
are
under
cover
and
the
another
joint
production
opens
wide
its
door
every
day
to
receive
the
unhappy
men
whose
time
for
detail
has
at
last
arrived
the
chapel
an
afterthought
is
also
ready
for
use
having
been
duly
dedicated
to
the
worship
of
god
the
town
is
complete
and
its
citizens
are
happy
men
thus
comfortably
fixed
with
light
guard
duty
and
little
else
to
do
found
time
of
course
to
do
a
little
foraging
in
the
country
around
by
this
means
often
during
the
winter
the
camp
enjoyed
great
abundance
and
variety
of
food
apples
and
fresh
pork
dried
fruit
milk
eggs
risen
bread
and
even
and
occasionally
a
whole
mess
would
be
filled
with
the
liveliest
expectations
by
the
information
that
bob
or
joe
was
expecting
box
from
the
wagon
comes
into
camp
escorted
by
the
expectant
bob
and
several
of
his
intimate
friends
the
box
is
dropped
from
the
wagon
to
the
ground
off
goes
the
top
and
in
go
busy
hands
and
eyes
here
are
clothes
shoes
and
hats
here
is
coffee
sugar
soda
salt
bread
fresh
butter
roast
beef
and
turkey
here
is
marked
to
be
used
in
case
of
sickness
or
wounds
here
is
paper
ink
pen
and
pencil
what
shall
be
done
with
this
pile
of
treasure
it
is
evident
one
man
can
not
eat
the
eatables
or
smoke
the
tobacco
and
pipes
call
in
then
the
friendly
aid
of
willing
comrades
they
come
they
see
they
devour
and
now
the
ever
true
and
devoted
citizens
of
the
much
and
often
besieged
city
of
richmond
conclude
to
send
a
new
year
dinner
to
their
defenders
in
the
army
that
portion
destined
for
the
camp
above
described
arrived
in
due
time
in
the
shape
of
one
good
turkey
each
of
the
three
companies
composing
the
battalion
appointed
a
man
to
draw
straws
for
the
turkey
the
successful
company
appointed
a
man
from
each
detachment
to
draw
again
then
the
detachment
messes
took
a
draw
and
the
fortunate
mess
devoured
the
turkey
but
the
soldiers
remembering
that
in
times
past
they
had
felt
constrained
to
divide
their
rations
with
the
poor
of
that
city
did
not
fail
in
gratitude
or
question
the
liberality
of
those
who
had
in
the
midst
of
great
distress
remembered
with
affection
the
soldiers
in
the
field
not
the
least
among
the
comforts
of
life
in
winter
quarters
was
the
pleasure
of
sitting
under
the
ministrations
of
an
amateur
barber
and
hearing
the
snip
snip
of
his
scissors
as
the
long
growth
of
hair
fell
to
the
ground
the
luxury
of
a
shave
the
possession
of
comb
brush
small
mirror
towels
and
soap
boots
blacked
every
day
white
collars
and
occasionally
a
starched
bosom
called
in
the
expressive
language
of
the
day
a
completed
the
restoration
of
the
man
to
decency
now
also
the
soldier
with
painful
care
threaded
his
needle
with
huge
thread
and
with
a
sort
of
awkwardness
sewed
on
the
button
or
with
even
greater
trepidation
attempted
a
patch
at
such
a
time
the
soldier
pondered
on
the
peculiar
fact
that
war
separates
men
from
women
a
man
can
not
thread
a
needle
with
ease
certainly
not
with
grace
he
sews
backwards
in
winter
quarters
every
man
had
his
chum
or
with
whom
he
slept
walked
talked
and
divided
hardship
or
comfort
as
they
came
along
and
the
affectionate
regard
of
each
for
the
other
was
often
beautiful
to
see
many
such
attachments
led
to
heroic
and
death
one
for
the
other
and
many
such
unions
remain
unbroken
after
twenty
years
have
passed
away
it
was
a
rare
occurrence
but
occasionally
the
father
or
mother
or
brother
or
sister
of
some
man
paid
him
a
visit
the
males
were
almost
sure
to
be
very
old
or
very
young
in
either
case
they
were
received
with
great
hospitality
given
the
best
place
to
sleep
the
best
the
camp
afforded
in
the
way
of
eatables
and
treated
with
the
greatest
courtesy
and
kindness
by
the
whole
command
but
the
lady
visitors
the
girls
who
could
describe
the
effect
of
their
appearance
in
camp
they
produced
conflict
in
the
soldier
breast
they
looked
so
clean
they
were
so
gentle
they
were
so
different
from
all
around
them
they
were
so
attractive
they
were
so
agreeable
and
sweet
and
fresh
and
happy
that
the
poor
fellows
would
have
liked
above
all
things
to
have
gotten
very
near
to
them
and
have
heard
their
kind
words
possibly
shake
hands
but
no

fun

fury
on
the
field
a
when
only
a
few
thousands
of
men
are
engaged
is
a
more
extensive
area
than
most
persons
would
suppose
when
large
bodies
of
men
twenty
to
fifty
thousand
on
each
side
are
engaged
a
mounted
man
at
liberty
to
gallop
from
place
to
place
could
scarcely
travel
the
field
over
during
the
continuance
of
the
battle
and
a
private
soldier
in
the
smallest
affair
sees
very
little
indeed
of
the
field
what
occurs
in
his
own
regiment
or
probably
in
his
own
company
is
about
all
and
is
sometimes
more
than
he
actually
sees
or
knows
thus
it
is
that
while
the
field
is
extensive
it
is
to
each
individual
limited
to
the
narrow
space
of
which
he
is
cognizant
the
dense
woods
of
virginia
often
choked
with
heavy
undergrowth
added
greatly
to
the
difficulty
of
observing
the
movements
of
large
bodies
of
troops
extended
in
line
of
battle
the
commanders
were
compelled
to
rely
almost
entirely
upon
the
information
gained
from
their
staff
officers
and
the
couriers
of
those
in
immediate
command
on
the
lines
the
beasts
of
burden
which
travel
the
great
desert
scent
the
oasis
and
the

miles
away
and
cheered
by
the
prospect
of
rest
and
refreshment

renewed
vigor

among
the
trumpets

and
he
smelleth
the
battle
afar
off
the
thunder
of
the
captains
and
the
shoutings
so
a
soldier
weary
and
worn
recognizing
the
signs
of
approaching
battle
did
quicken
his
lagging
steps
and
cry
out
for
joy
at
the
prospect

most

presently
a
very

fire
and
they
stand
six
and
twelve
feet
apart
calling
to
each

laughing
shouting
and
cheering
but
advancing
there
one
fellow
has
dropped
his
musket
like
something

his
finger
is
shot
away
his

congratulate
him
and
he
walks
sadly
away
to

and
falls
with
a
ball
through

neck

wounded
two
comrades
raise
him
to

and
try
to
lead
him
away
but
one
of
them
receives
a
ball
in
his
thigh
which
crushes
the
bone
and
he
falls
groaning
to
the
ground
the

advises
his
poor
dying
friend
to
lie
down
helps
him
to
do
so
and
runs
to
join

man
securely
posted

some

still
they
stand
now
a
battery
has
been

into

the
heavy
trails
have
fallen
to
the

at
the
command

cannoniers
have
stepped
in
briskly
and
loaded
the

at
the
muzzle
and
away
goes
a
shell
the
poor
fellows
in
the
woods
rejoice
as
it
crashes
through
the
trees
over
their

and
cheer
when
it
explodes

somebody
has

the

the

never

the
men
on

have
at

found
it
advisable
to
lie
down
at
full
length
on
the
ground
though
it
is
so
wet
and
place
their
heads
against
the
trees
in
front
they
can
not
advance
and
they
can
not
retire
without
in
either
case
exposing
themselves
to
almost
certain
death
they
are
waiting

hear
the

advancing
through
the
pines
the
snapping
of

the
neighing
of
horses
and
hoarse
commands
inspire
a
husky
cheer
and
when
the
line
of
the
old
brigade
breaks
through
the
trees
in
full
view
they
fairly
yell
every
man
jumps
to
his
feet
the
brigade
presses
firmly
forward
and
soon
the
roll
of
musketry
tells
all
who
are
waiting
to
hear
that
serious
work
is
progressing
away
down
in
the
woods
all
honor

the
devoted
infantry
the
hour

enter

at

and
the
rear
is
extended
at
once

our
place
now
is
at
the
front
on
the
field
we
are
to
watch
the
details
of
a
small
part
of
the
great
expanse
as
we
approach
a
ludicrous
scene
presents
itself
a
artilleryman
is
energetically
thrashing
a
dejected
looking
individual
with
a
hickory
bush
and
urging
him
to
the
front
he
has
managed
to
keep
out
of
many
a
fight
but
now
he
go
in
the
captain
has
detailed
a
man
to
him
in
and
the
man
is
doing
it
with
every
blow
the
poor
fellow
yells
and
begs
to
be
spared
but
his
determined
guardian
will
not
cease
they
press
on
the
one
screaming
and
the
other
lashing
till
they
reach
the
battery
in
position
and
firing
on
the
retiring
enemy
a
battery
of
the
enemy
is
replying
and
shells
are
bursting
overhead
or
ploughing
huge
furrows
in
the
ground
musket
balls
are
rapping
on
the
rims
of
the
wheels
and
sinking
with
a
deep
thud
into
the
bodies
of
the
poor
horses
smoke
obscures
the
scene
but
the
cannoniers
in
faint
outline
can
be
seen
cheerfully
serving
the
guns
as
the
opposing
battery
ceases
firing
and
having
limbered
up
scampers
away
and
the
last
of
the
enemy
infantry
slowly
sinks
into
the
woods
out
of
sight
and
out
of
reach
a
wild
cheer
breaks
from
the
cannoniers
who
toss
their
caps
in
the
air
and
shout
shake
hands
and
shout
again
while
the
curtain
of
smoke
is
raised
by
the
breeze
and
borne
away
the
cavalry
is
gone
with
jingle
and
clatter
they
have
passed
through
the
lines
and
down
the
hill
and
are
already
demanding
surrender
from
many
a
belated
man
there
will
be
no
rest
for
that
retreating
column
stuart
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
his
lips
puckered
as
if
to
whistle
a
merry
lay
is
on
their
flanks
in
their
rear
and
in
their
front
the
enemy
will
send
their
cavalry
after
him
of
course
but
he
will
stay
with
them
nevertheless
illustration
add
now
the
stream
of
wounded
men
slowly
making
their
way
to
the
rear
the
groups
of
dejected
prisoners
plodding
along
under
guard
and
you
have
about
as
much
of
a
battle
as
one
private
soldier
ever
sees
illustration
coming
out
but
after
the
battle
man
will
tell
to

what

whole

then
the
stories
of

an
artilleryman
he
must
have
been
a
driver
says
when
the
firing
had
ceased
an
old
battery
horse
his
lower
jaw
carried
away
by
a
shot
with
blood
streaming
from
his
wound
staggered
up
to
him
gazed
beseechingly
at
him
and
groaning
piteously
laid
his
bloody
jaws
on
his
shoulder
and
so
made
his
appeal
for
sympathy
he
was
beyond
help
the
pathetic
nature
of
this
story
reminds
a
comrade
that
a
new
man
in
the
battery
desiring
to
save
the
labor
incident
to
running
up
the
gun
after
the
rebound
determined
to
hold
on
to
the
handspike
press
the
trail
into
the
ground
and
hold
her
fast
he
did
try
but
the
rebound
proceeded
as
usual
and
the
man
was
shocked
at
the
failure
of
his
effort
nothing
daunted
the
same
individual
soon
after
applied
his
lips
to
the
vent
of
the
gun
which
was
choked
and
endeavored
to
clear
it
by
an
energetic
blast
from
his
lungs
the
vent
was
not
cleared
but
the
lips
of
the
recruit
were
nicely
browned
and
the
detachment
greatly
amused
at
another
gun
it
has
happened
that
no
and
no
have
had
a
difficulty
no
having
failed
to
serve
the
vent
there
was
a
premature
explosion
and
no
being
about
to
withdraw
the
rammer
fell
heavily
to
the
ground
apparently
dead
no
seeing
what
a
calamity
he
had
caused
hung
over
the
dead
man
and
begged
him
to
speak
and
exonerate
him
from
blame
after
no
had
exhausted
all
his
eloquence
and
pathos
no
suddenly
rose
to
his
feet
and
informed
him
that
the
premature
explosion
was
a
fact
but
the
death
of
no
was
a
joke
intended
to
warn
him
that
if
he
ever
failed
again
to
serve
that
vent
he
would
have
his
head
broken
by
a
blow
from
a
this
joke
having
been
completed
in
all
its
details
the
firing
was
continued
another
man
tells
how
eggleston
had
his
arm
torn
away
by
a
solid
shot
and
as
he
walked
away
held
up
the
bleeding
quivering
stump
exclaiming
never
mind
boys
i
come
back
soon
and
try
with
this
other
one
alas
poor
fellow
he
had
fought
his
last
fight
poor
tom
he
who
was
always
as
he
said
willing
to
give
half
a
leg
or
so
was
struck
about
the
waist
by
a
shot
which
almost
cut
him
in
two
he
fell
heavily
to
the
ground
and
though
in
awful
agony
managed
to
say
tell
mother
i
died
doing
my
duty
while
the
fight
lasted
several
of
the
best
and
bravest
received
wounds
apparently
mortal
and
were
laid
aside
covered
by
an
old
army
blanket
they
refused
to
die
however
and
remain
to
this
day
to
tell
their
own
stories
of
the
war
and
of
their
marvelous
recovery
at
the
battle
of
the
wilderness
may
a
man
from
north
carolina
precipitated
a
severe
fight
by
asking
a
very
simple
and
reasonable
question
the
line
of
battle
had
been
pressed
forward
and
was
in
close
proximity
to
the
enemy
the
thick
and
tangled
undergrowth
prevented
a
sight
of
the
enemy
but
every
man
felt
he
was
near
everything
was
hushed
and
still
no
one
dared
to
speak
above
a
whisper
it
was
evening
and
growing
dark
as
the
men
lay
on
the
ground
keenly
sensible
to
every
sound
and
anxiously
waiting
they
heard
the
firm
tread
of
a
man
walking
along
the
line
as
he
walked
they
heard
also
the
of
a
pile
of
canteens
hung
around
his
neck
he
advanced
with
deliberate
mien
to
within
a
few
yards
of
the
line
and
opened
a
terrific
fight
by
quietly
saying
can
any
you
fellows
tell
a
man
whar
he
can
git
some
water
instantly
the
thicket
was
illumined
by
the
flash
of
a
thousand
muskets
the
men
leaped
to
their
feet
the
officers
shouted
and
the
battle
was
begun
neither
side
would
yield
and
there
they
fought
till
many
died
soon
however
the
reserve
brigade
began
to
make
its
way
through
the
thicket
the
first
man
to
appear
was
the
brigadier
thirty
yards
ahead
of
his
brigade
his
sword
between
his
teeth
and
parting
the
bushes
with
both
hands
as
he
spurred
his
horse
through
the
tangled
growth
eager
for
the
fight
his
eyes
glaring
and
his
countenance
lit
up
with
fury
his
first
word
was
forward
and
forward
went
the
line
illustration
the
battle
opens
on
the
march
from
petersburg
to
appomattox
after
a
sharp
engagement
some
men
of
cutshaw
artillery
battalion
acting
as
infantry
made
a
stand
for
a
while
on
a
piece
of
high
ground
they
noticed
hanging
around
in
a
lonely
distracted
way
a
tall
lean
shaggy
fellow
holding
or
rather
leaning
on
a
long
staff
around
which
hung
a
faded
thinking
him
out
of
his
place
and
skulking
they
suggested
to
him
that
it
would
be
well
for
him
to
join
his
regiment
he
replied
that
his
regiment
had
all
run
away
and
he
was
merely
waiting
a
chance
to
be
useful
just
then
the
enemy
advancing
skirmishers
poured
a
hot
fire
into
the
group
and
the
artillerymen
began
to
discuss
the
propriety
of
leaving
the
remembering
their
insinuations
saw
an
opportunity
for
retaliation
standing
as
he
was
in
the
midst
of
a
shower
of
musket
balls
he
seemed
almost
ready
to
fall
asleep
but
suddenly
his
face
was
illumined
with
a
singularly
pleased
and
childish
smile
quietly
walking
up
close
to
the
group
he
said
any
you
boys
want
to
the
boys
answered
yes
well
said
the
imperturbable
i
the
man
to
carry
this
here
old
flag
for
you
just
follow
me
so
saying
he
led
the
squad
full
into
the
face
of
the
advancing
enemy
and
never
once
seemed
to
think
of
stopping
until
he
was
urged
to
retire
with
the
squad
he
came
back
smiling
from
head
to
foot
and
suffered
no
more
insinuations
at
gettysburg
when
the
artillery
fire
was
at
its
height
a
brawny
fellow
who
seemed
happy
at
the
prospect
for
a
hot
time
broke
out
singing
backward
roll
backward
o
time
in
thy
flight
make
me
a
child
again
just
for
this
another
fellow
near
him
replied
yes
and
a
child
at
that
at
fredericksburg
a
good
soldier
now
a
farmer
in
chesterfield
county
virginia
was
desperately
wounded
and
lay
on
the
field
all
night
in
the
morning
a
surgeon
approached
him
and
inquired
the
nature
of
his
wound
finding
a
wound
which
is
always
considered
fatal
he
advised
the
man
to
remain
quietly
where
he
was
and
die
the
man
insisted
on
being
removed
to
a
hospital
saying
in
the
most
emphatic
manner
that
though
every
man
ever
wounded
as
he
was
his
bowels
were
punctured
by
the
ball
had
died
he
was
determined
not
to
die
the
surgeon
struck
by
the
man
courage
and
nerve
consented
to
remove
him
advising
him
however
not
to
cherish
the
hope
of
recovery
after
a
hard
struggle
he
did
recover
and
is
a
living
example
of
the
power
of
a
determined
will
at
the
wilderness
when
the
fight
was
raging
in
the
tangled
woods
and
a
man
could
scarcely
trust
himself
to
move
in
any
direction
for
fear
of
going
astray
or
running
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
a
mere
boy
was
wounded
rushing
out
of
the
woods
his
eyes
staring
and
his
face
pale
with
fright
he
shouted
where
the
rear
mister
i
say
mister
where
the
rear
of
course
he
was
laughed
at
the
very
grim
fact
that
there
was
no
rear
in
the
sense
of
safety
made
the
question
irresistibly
ludicrous
the
conduct
of
this
boy
was
not
exceptional
it
was
no
uncommon
thing
to
see
the
best
men
badly
demoralized
and
eager
to
go
to
the
rear
because
of
a
wound
scarcely
worthy
of
the
name
on
the
other
hand
it
sometimes
happened
that
men
seriously
wounded
could
not
be
convinced
of
their
danger
and
remained
on
the
field
the
day
general
stuart
fell
mortally
wounded
there
was
a
severe
fight
in
the
woods
not
far
from
the
old
brook
church
a
few
miles
from
richmond
the
enemy
was
making
a
determined
stand
in
order
to
gain
time
to
repair
a
bridge
which
they
were
compelled
to
use
and
the
confederate
infantry
skirmishers
were
pushing
them
hard
the
fighting
was
stubborn
and
the
casualties
on
the
confederate
side
very
numerous
in
the
midst
of
the
fight
a
voice
was
heard
shouting
where
my
boy
i
looking
for
my
boy
soon
the
owner
of
the
voice
appeared
tall
slim
aged
with
silver
gray
hair
dressed
in
a
full
suit
of
broadcloth
a
tall
silk
hat
and
a
clerical
collar
and
cravat
completed
his
attire
his
voice
familiar
to
the
people
of
virginia
was
deep
and
powerful
as
he
continued
to
shout
the
men
replied
go
back
old
gentleman
you
get
hurt
here
go
back
go
back
no
no
said
he
i
can
go
anywhere
my
boy
has
to
go
and
the
lord
is
here
i
want
to
see
my
boy
and
i
will
see
him
then
the
order
forward
was
given
and
the
men
made
once
more
for
the
enemy
the
old
gentleman
his
beaver
in
one
hand
a
big
stick
in
the
other
his
long
hair
flying
shouting
come
on
boys
disappeared
in
the
depths
of
the
woods
well
in
front
he
was
a
methodist
minister
an
old
member
of
the
virginia
conference
but
his
carriage
that
day
was
soldierly
and
grand
one
thought
that
boy
was
made
the
old
man
feel
that
he
might
brave
the
danger
too
no
man
who
saw
him
there
will
ever
forget
the
parson
who
led
the
charge
at
brook
church
at
the
battle
of
spottsylvania
court
house
a
gun
in
position
somewhat
in
advance
of
the
line
was
so
much
exposed
to
the
enemy
fire
that
it
was
abandoned
later
in
the
day
the
battery
being
ordered
to
move
the
captain
directed
the
sergeant
to
take
his
detachment
and
bring
in
the
gun
the
sergeant
and
his
gunner
with
a
number
of
men
went
out
to
bring
in
the
gun
by
hand
two
men
lifted
the
trail
and
the
sergeant
ordered
all
together
the
gun
moved
but
moved
a
the
fire
was
hot
and
hands
were
on
the
same
the
side
farthest
from
the
enemy
after
some
persuasion
the
corporal
and
the
sergeant
managed
to
induce
a
man
or
two
to
get
on
the
other
side
with
them
and
they
were
moving
along
very
comfortably
when
a
shrapnel
whacked
the
sergeant
on
his
breast
breaking
his
ribs
and
tearing
away
the
muscle
of
one
arm
he
fell
into
the
arms
of
the
corporal
seeing
that
their
only
hope
of
escaping
from
this
fire
was
work
the
cannoniers
bent
to
the
wheels
and
the
gun
rolled
slowly
to
shelter
it
was
at
spottsylvania
court
house
that
the
federal
infantry
rushed
over
the
works
and
engaging
in
a
fight
drove
out
the
confederate
infantry
on
one
part
of
the
line
the
artillerymen
stood
to
their
posts
and
when
the
federal
troops
passing
the
works
had
massed
themselves
inside
fired
to
the
right
and
left
up
and
down
the
lines
cutting
roadways
through
the
compact
masses
of
men
and
holding
their
positions
until
the
confederate
infantry
reformed
drove
out
the
enemy
and
the
line
several
batteries
were
completely
overrun
and
the
cannoniers
sought
and
found
safety
front
of
the
whence
the
enemy
had
made
their
charge
at
another
point
on
the
lines
where
there
was
no
infantry
support
the
enemy
charged
repeatedly
and
made
every
effort
to
carry
the
works
but
were
handsomely
repulsed
by
an
examination
of
the
ground
in
front
of
the
works
after
the
fight
disclosed
the
fact
that
all
the
dead
and
wounded
were
victims
of
artillery
fire
the
dead
were
literally
torn
to
pieces
and
the
wounded
dreadfully
mangled
scarcely
a
man
was
hurt
on
the
confederate
side
at
fort
harrison
a
few
miles
below
richmond
in
a
ludicrous
scene
resulted
from
the
firing
of
a
salute
with
shotted
guns
federal
artillery
occupied
the
fort
and
the
lines
immediately
in
front
of
it
were
held
by
the
department
battalion
composed
of
the
clerks
in
the
various
government
offices
in
richmond
who
had
been
ordered
out
to
meet
an
emergency
just
before
sundown
the
detail
for
picket
duty
was
formed
and
about
to
march
out
to
the
picket
line
the
clerks
presenting
quite
a
soldierly
appearance
suddenly
bang
went
a
gun
in
the
fort
and
a
shell
came
tearing
over
bang
again
and
bang
bang
and
more
shells
exploding
pow
pow
what
consternation
in
an
instant
the
beautiful
line
melted
away
as
by
magic
every
man
took
to
shelter
and
the
place
was
desolate
the
firing
was
rapid
regular
and
apparently
aimed
to
strike
the
confederate
lines
but
ceased
as
suddenly
as
it
had
begun
general
custis
lee
whose
tent
was
near
by
observing
the
panic
stepped
quietly
up
to
the
parapet
of
the
works
folded
his
arms
and
walked
back
and
forth
without
uttering
a
word
or
looking
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
his
cool
behavior
coupled
with
the
silence
of
the
guns
soon
reassured
the
trembling
clerks
and
one
by
one
they
dropped
into
line
again
general
butler
had
heard
some
news
that
pleased
him
and
ordered
a
salute
with
shotted
guns
that
was
all
two
boys
who
had
volunteered
for
service
with
the
militia
in
the
same
neighborhood
were
detailed
for
picket
duty
it
was
the
custom
to
put
three
men
on
each
post
two
militia
boys
and
one
veteran
the
boys
and
an
old
soldier
of
johnston
division
were
marched
to
their
post
where
they
found
ready
dug
a
pit
about
five
feet
deep
and
three
feet
wide
it
was
quite
dark
and
the
boys
realizing
fully
their
exposed
position
at
once
occupied
the
pit
the
old
soldier
saw
he
had
an
opportunity
to
have
a
good
time
knowing
that
those
boys
would
keep
wide
awake
giving
them
a
short
lecture
about
the
importance
of
great
watchfulness
he
warned
them
to
be
ready
to
leave
there
very
rapidly
at
any
moment
and
above
all
to
keep
very
quiet
his
words
were
wasted
as
the
boys
would
not
have
closed
their
eyes
or
uttered
a
word
for
the
world
these
little
details
arranged
the
cunning
old
soldier
prepared
to
make
himself
comfortable
first
he
gathered
a
few
small
twigs
and
made
a
fire
on
the
fire
he
put
a
battered
old
tin
cup
into
this
he
poured
some
coffee
from
his
canteen
from
some
mysterious
place
in
his
clothes
he
drew
forth
sugar
and
dropped
it
into
the
cup
next
from
an
old
worn
haversack
he
took
a
chunk
of
raw
bacon
and
a
pone
of
corn
bread
then
drawing
a
large
pocket
knife
in
a
dexterous
manner
he
sliced
and
ate
his
bread
and
meat
occasionally
sipping
his
coffee
his
evening
meal
leisurely
completed
he
filled
his
pipe
smoked
and
stirred
up
the
imaginations
of
the
boys
by
telling
how
dangerous
a
duty
they
were
performing
told
them
how
easy
it
would
be
for
the
yankees
to
creep
up
and
shoot
them
or
capture
and
carry
them
off
having
finished
his
smoke
he
knocked
out
the
ashes
and
dropped
the
pipe
in
his
pocket
then
he
actually
unrolled
his
blanket
and
it
made
the
perspiration
start
on
the
brows
of
the
boys
to
see
the
man
folly
then
taking
off
his
shoes
he
laid
down
on
one
edge
took
hold
of
the
blanket
and
rolled
himself
over
to
the
other
side
and
with
a
kind
good
night
to
the
boys
began
to
snore
the
poor
boys
stood
like
statues
in
the
pit
till
broad
day
in
the
morning
the
old
soldier
thanked
them
for
not
disturbing
him
and
quietly
proceeded
to
prepare
his
breakfast
after
the
fight
at
fisher
hill
in
early
army
in
full
retreat
and
greatly
demoralized
was
strung
out
along
the
valley
pike
the
federal
cavalry
was
darting
around
picking
up
prisoners
shooting
drivers
and
making
themselves
generally
disagreeable
it
happened
that
an
artilleryman
who
was
separated
from
his
gun
was
making
pretty
good
time
on
foot
getting
to
the
rear
and
had
the
of
a
demoralized
infantryman
who
had
thrown
away
his
musket
so
one
of
these
lively
cavalrymen
trotted
up
and
waving
his
sabre
told
the
artilleryman
to
surrender
but
he
did
stop
he
merely
glanced
over
his
shoulder
and
kept
on
then
the
cavalryman
became
indignant
and
shouted
halt
d
n
you
halt
and
still
he
would
not
halt
said
the
cavalryman
halt
you
d
n
s
of
a
halt
then
the
artilleryman
halted
and
remarking
that
he
did
allow
any
man
to
speak
to
that
way
seized
a
huge
stick
turned
on
the
cavalryman
knocked
him
out
of
his
saddle
and
proceeded
on
his
journey
to
the
rear
this
artilleryman
fought
with
a
musket
at
sailor
creek
he
found
himself
surrounded
by
the
enemy
who
demanded
surrender
he
refused
said
they
must
take
him
and
laid
about
him
with
the
butt
of
his
musket
till
he
had
damaged
some
of
the
party
considerably
he
was
however
overpowered
and
made
a
prisoner
experienced
men
in
battle
always
availed
themselves
of
any
shelter
within
reach
a
tree
a
fence
a
mound
of
earth
a
ditch
anything
sometimes
their
efforts
to
find
shelter
were
very
amusing
and
even
silly
men
lying
on
the
ground
have
been
seen
to
put
an
old
canteen
before
their
heads
as
a
shelter
from
musket
balls
and
during
a
heavy
fire
of
artillery
seemed
to
feel
safer
a
only
recruits
and
fools
neglected
the
smallest
shelter
the
more
experienced
troops
knew
better
when
to
give
up
than
green
ones
and
never
fought
well
after
they
were
satisfied
that
they
could
not
accomplish
their
purpose
consequently
it
often
happened
that
the
best
troops
failed
where
the
raw
ones
did
well
the
old
confederate
soldier
decide
some
questions
for
himself
to
the
last
he
maintained
the
right
of
private
judgment
and
especially
on
the

eighty
the

the
old
clifton

was
well
fortified
and
had
the
additional
protection
of
the
river
along
the
entire
front
of
perhaps
a
mile
the
works
extended
from
the
appomattox
on
the
right
to
swift
creek
on
the

there
were
some
guns
of
heavy
calibre
mounted
and
ready
for
action
and
in
addition
to
these
some
disposed
along
the
line
at
suitable
points
the
enemy
had
formidable
works
opposite
but
had
not
used
their

to
disturb
the
quiet
routine
of
the

picketed
by

as

but
without

usual

the

was
so
heavy
that
half
the
men
were
always
on
guard
the

built
by
the

were
located
with

on
the

of

gullies
which
divided

were
underground
to
the

consequently
the

being
sandy
there
was
a
constant
filtering
of

through
the

and
in

of
the
greatest

the

found
its
way
into
the

stuck
to
the
greasy
and
even
filled
the
hair
of
the

as
they
slept
in

of
quantity
and
quality
being
generally
peas
sour
or
rancid
and
unbolted
corn
meal
relieved
occasionally
with
a
small
supply
of
luscious
canned
beef
imported
from
england
good
flour
half
rations
a
little
coffee
and
sugar
and
once
apple
brandy
for
all
hands
ragged
barefooted
and
even
bareheaded
men
were
so
common
that
they
did
not
excite
notice
or
comment
and
did
not
expect
or
seem
to
feel
the
want
of
sympathy
and
yet
there
was
scarcely
a
complaint
or
murmur
of
dissatisfaction
and
not
the
slightest
indication
of
fear
or
doubt
the
spirit
of
the
men
was
as
good
as
ever
and
the
possibility
of
immediate
disaster
had
not
cast
its
shadow
there
several
incidents
occurred
during
the
stay
of
the
battalion
at
fort
clifton
which
will
serve
to
illustrate
life
on
the
lines
it
occurred
to
a
man
picketing
the
river
bank
that
it
would
be
amusing
to
take
careful
aim
at
the
man
on
the
other
side
doing
the
same
duty
for
the
enemy
fire
laugh
to
see
the
fellow
jump
and
dodge
and
then
try
again
he
fired
laughed
dropped
his
musket
to
and
while
smiling
with
satisfaction
heard
the
thud
of
a
bullet
and
felt
an
agonizing
pain
in
his
arm
his
musket
fell
to
the
ground
and
he
walked
back
to
camp
with
his
arm
swinging
heavily
at
his
side
the
surgeon
soon
relieved
him
of
it
altogether
the
poor
fellow
learned
a
lesson
the
yank
had
beat
him
at
his
own
game
the
was
a
framed
building
about
twelve
feet
square
having
two
rooms
one
above
the
other
the
detail
for
guard
duty
was
required
to
stay
in
the
those
who
wished
to
sleep
going
while
others
just
relieved
or
about
to
go
on
duty
clustered
around
the
fire
in
the
lower
room
one
night
when
the
upper
floor
was
covered
with
sleeping
men
an
improvised
infantryman
who
had
been
relieved
from
duty
walked
in
and
preparatory
to
taking
his
stand
at
the
fire
threw
his
musket
carelessly
in
the
corner
a
loud
report
and
angry
exclamations
immediately
followed
the
sergeant
of
the
guard
noticing
the
direction
of
the
ball
hurried
and
to
the
disgust
of
the
sleepy
fellows
ordered
all
hands
to
turn
out
grumbling
growling
stretching
and
rubbing
their
eyes
the
men
got
up
some
one
inquired
where
pryor
his
chum
who
had
been
sleeping
by
his
side
replied
there
he
is
asleep
shake
him
his
blanket
was
drawn
aside
and
with
a
shake
he
was
commanded
to
get
up
but
there
was
no
motion
no
reply
the
ball
had
passed
through
his
heart
and
he
had
passed
without
a
groan
or
a
sigh
from
deep
sleep
to
death
the
man
who
was
killed
and
the
man
who
was
sleeping
by
his
side
under
the
same
blanket
were
members
of
the
second
company
richmond
howitzers
the
careless
man
who
made
the
trouble
was
also
an
artilleryman
from
one
of
the
other
batteries
shortly
after
this
accident
after
a
quiet
day
the
men
retired
to
their
huts
and
the
whole
camp
was
still
as
a
country
the
pickets
on
the
river
edge
could
hear
those
on
the
opposite
side
asking
the
corporal
of
the
guard
the
hour
and
complaining
that
they
had
not
been
promptly
relieved
suddenly
a
terrific
bombardment
commenced
and
the
earth
fairly
trembled
the
men
suddenly
awakened
heard
the
roar
of
the
guns
the
rush
of
the
shots
and
the
explosion
of
the
shells
to
a
man
only
half
awake
the
shells
seemed
to
pass
very
near
and
in
every
direction
in
a
moment
all
were
rushing
out
of
their
houses
and
soon
the
hillsides
and
bluffs
were
covered
with
an
excited
crowd
gazing
on
the
sight
the
firing
was
away
to
the
right
and
there
was
not
the
slightest
danger
having
realized
this
fact
the
interest
was
intense
the
shells
from
the
opposite
lines
met
and
passed
in
their
burning
fuses
forming
an
arch
of
fire
which
paled
occasionally
as
a
shell
burst
illuminating
the
heavens
with
its
blaze
the
uproar
even
at
such
a
distance
was
terrible
the
officers
fearing
that
fire
would
be
opened
along
the
whole
line
ordered
the
cannoniers
to
their
posts
men
were
sent
down
into
the
magazine
with
lanterns
to
arrange
the
ammunition
for
the
heavy
guns
the
lids
of
the
limbers
of
the
were
thrown
up
the
cannoniers
were
counted
off
at
their
posts
the
brush
which
had
been
piled
before
the
embrasures
was
torn
away
and
with
implements
in
hand
all
stood
at
attention
till
the
last
shot
was
fired
the
heavens
were
dark
again
and
silence
reigned
soon
all
hands
were
as
sound
asleep
as
though
nothing
had
occurred
the
next
morning
an
artilleryman
came
walking
leisurely
towards
the
camp
and
being
recognized
as
belonging
to
a
battery
which
was
in
position
on
that
part
of
the
line
where
the
firing
of
the
last
night
occurred
was
plied
with
questions
as
to
the
loss
on
our
side
who
was
hurt
etc
smiling
at
the
anxious
faces
and
eager
questions
he
replied
when
last
night
nobody
it
was
astounding
but
nevertheless
true
on
another
occasion
some
scattering
shots
were
heard
up
the
river
and
after
a
while
a
body
came
floating
down
the
stream
it
was
hauled
on
shore
and
buried
in
the
sand
a
little
above
mark
it
was
a
poor
confederate
who
had
attempted
to
desert
to
the
enemy
but
was
shot
while
swimming
for
the
opposite
bank
of
the
river
his
grave
was
the
centre
of
the
beat
of
one
of
the
picket
posts
on
the
river
bank
and
there
were
few
men
so
indifferent
to
the
presence
of
the
dead
as
not
to
prefer
some
other
post
and
so
while
there
had
been
no
fighting
there
were
always
incidents
to
remind
the
soldier
that
danger
lurked
around
and
that
he
could
not
long
avoid
his
share
the
camp
was
not
as
joyous
as
it
had
been
and
all
felt
that
the
time
was
near
which
would
try
the
courage
of
the
stoutest
the
struggles
of
the
troops
on
the
right
with
overwhelming
numbers
and
reports
of
adversities
caused
a
general
expectation
that
the
troops
lying
so
idly
at
the
clifton
house
would
be
ordered
to
the
point
of
danger
they
had
not
long
to
wait
sunday
came
and
went
as
many
a
sunday
had
there
was
nothing
unusual
apparent
unless
perhaps
the
dull
and
listless
attitudes
of
the
men
and
the
monotonous
call
of
those
on
guard
were
more
oppressive
than
usual
the
sun
went
down
the
hills
and
valleys
and
the
river
were
veiled
in
darkness
here
and
there
twinkling
lights
were
visible
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
could
be
heard
a
low
rumbling
which
experienced
men
said
was
the
movement
of
artillery
and
ammunition
trains
bound
to
the
enemy
left
to
press
the
already
broken
right
of
the
confederate
line
some
had
actually
gone
to
sleep
for
the
night
others
were
huddled
around
the
fires
in
the
little
huts
and
a
few
sat
out
on
the
discussing
the
probabilities
of
the
near
future
a
most
peaceful
scene
a
most
peaceful
spot
hymns
were
sung
and
prayers
were
made
though
no
preacher
was
there
memory
reverted
fondly
to
the
past
to
home
and
friends
the
spirit
of
the
soldier
soared
away
to
other
scenes
and
left
to
sit
blankly
down
gaze
at
the
stars
and
feel
unspeakable
longings
for
undefined
joys
and
weep
for
very
tenderness
of
heart
at
his
own
sad
loneliness
at
ten
some
man
mounted
on
horseback
rode
up
to
one
of
the
huts
and
said
the
battalion
had
orders
to
move
it
was
so
dark
that
his
face
was
scarcely
visible
in
a
few
minutes
orders
were
received
to
destroy
what
could
be
destroyed
without
noise
or
fire
this
was
promptly
done
then
the
companies
were
formed
the
roll
was
called
and
the
battalion
marched
slowly
and
solemnly
away
no
one
doubted
that
the
command
would
march
at
once
to
the
assistance
of
the
troops
at
or
near
five
forks
it
was
thought
that
before
morning
every
man
would
have
his
musket
and
his
supply
of
ammunition
and
the
crack
of
day
would
see
the
battalion
rushing
into
battle
in
regular
infantry
style
whooping
and
yelling
like
demons
but
they
got
no
arms
that
night
the
march
was
steady
till
broad
day
of
monday
the
of
april
of
course
the
men
felt
mortified
at
having
to
leave
the
guns
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
as
the
battery
horses
which
had
been
sent
away
to
winter
had
not
returned
it
was
evident
that
the
battalion
had
bid
farewell
to
artillery
and
commenced
a
new
career
as
infantry
as
the
night
wore
on
the
men
learned
that
the
command
was
not
going
to
any
point
on
the
lines
that
being
determined
no
one
could
guess
its
destination
later
in
the
night
probably
as
day
approached
the
sky
in
the
direction
of
richmond
was
lit
with
the
red
glare
of
distant
conflagration
and
at
short
intervals
there
were
deep
growling
explosions
of
magazines
the
roads
were
filled
with
other
troops
all
hurrying
in
the
same
direction
there
was
no
sign
of
panic
or
fear
but
the
very
wheels
seemed
turning
with
unusual
energy
the
men
wore
the
look
of
determination
haste
and
eagerness
one
could
feel
the
energy
which
surrounded
him
and
animated
the
men
and
things
which
moved
so
steadily
on
on
on
there
was
no
laughing
singing
or
talking
nothing
but
the
steady
tread
of
the
column
and
the
surly
rumbling
of
the
trains
as
morning
dawned
the
battalion
struck
the
main
road
leading
from
richmond
refugees
told
the
story
of
the
evacuation
and
informed
the
boys
from
the
city
that
it
was
in
the
hands
of
the
enemy
and
burning
and
the
chances
were
that
not
one
house
would
be
left
standing
here
it
became
clearly
understood
that
the
whole
army
was
in
full
retreat
from
this
point
the
men
began
to
say
as
they
marched
that
it
was
easier
to
march
away
than
it
would
be
to
get
back
but
that
they
expected
and
hoped
to
their
way
back
if
they
had
to
contest
every
inch
some
even
regretted
the
celerity
of
the
march
for
they
said
the
further
we
march
the
more
difficult
it
will
be
to
win
our
way
back
little
did
they
know
of
the
immense
pressure
at
the
rear
and
the
earnest
push
of
the
enemy
on
the
flank
as
he
strove
to
reach
and
overlap
the
advance
of
his
hitherto
defiant
but
now
retreating
foe
a
detail
had
been
left
at
fort
clifton
with
orders
to
spike
the
guns
blow
up
the
magazine
destroy
everything
which
could
be
of
value
to
the
enemy
and
rejoin
the
command
the
order
was
obeyed
and
every
man
of
the
detail
resumed
his
place
in
the
ranks
from
this
point
to
appomattox
the
march
was
almost
continuous
day
and
night
and
it
is
with
the
greatest
difficulty
that
a
private
in
the
ranks
can
recall
with
accuracy
the
dates
and
places
on
the
march
night
was
day
day
was
night
there
was
no
stated
time
to
sleep
eat
or
rest
and
the
events
of
morning
became
strangely
intermingled
with
the
events
of
evening
breakfast
dinner
and
supper
were
merged
into
something
to
eat
whenever
and
wherever
it
could
be
had
the
incidents
of
the
march
however
lose
none
of
their
significance
on
this
account
and
so
far
as
possible
they
will
be
given
in
the
order
in
which
they
occurred
and
the
day
and
hour
fixed
as
accurately
as
they
can
be
by
those
who
witnessed
and
participated
in
its
dangers
and
hardships
monday
the
the
column
was
pushed
along
without
ceremony
at
a
rapid
pace
until
night
when
a
halt
was
ordered
and
the
battalion
laid
down
in
a
piece
of
pine
woods
to
rest
there
was
some
desultory
eating
in
this
camp
but
so
little
of
it
that
there
was
no
lasting
effect
at
early
dawn
of
tuesday
the
the
men
struggled
to
their
feet
and
with
empty
stomachs
and
brave
hearts
resumed
their
places
in
the
ranks
and
struggled
on
with
the
column
as
it
marched
steadily
in
the
direction
of
moore
church
in
amelia
county
where
it
arrived
in
the
night
the
men
laid
down
under
the
shelter
of
a
fine
grove
and
friend
divided
with
friend
the
little
supplies
of
raw
bacon
and
bread
picked
up
on
the
march
they
were
scarcely
stretched
on
the
ground
ready
for
a
good
nap
when
the
orderly
of
the
howitzers
commenced
bawling
detail
for
guard
detail
for
guard
fall
in
here
fall
in
then
followed
the
names
of
the
detail
four
men
answered
to
their
names
but
declared
they
could
not
keep
awake
if
placed
on
guard
their
remonstrance
was
in
vain
they
were
marched
off
to
picket
a
road
leading
to
camp
and
when
they
were
relieved
said
they
had
slept
soundly
on
their
posts
no
one
blamed
them
while
it
was
yet
night
all
hands
were
roused
from
profound
sleep
the
battalion
was
formed
and
away
they
went
stumbling
bumping
against
each
other
and
as
they
whenever
the
column
halted
for
a
moment
as
it
did
frequently
during
the
night
the
men
dropped
heavily
to
the
ground
and
were
instantly
asleep
then
the
officers
would
commence
forward
column
forward
those
first
on
their
feet
went
stumbling
on
over
their
prostrate
comrades
who
would
in
turn
be
awakened
and
again
the
column
was
in
motion
and
nothing
heard
but
the
monotonous
tread
of
the
weary
feet
the
ringing
and
rattling
of
the
trappings
of
the
horses
and
the
cry
of
close
up
men
close
up
through
the
long
weary
night
there
was
no
rest
the
alternate
halting
and
hurrying
was
terribly
trying
and
taxed
the
endurance
of
the
most
determined
men
to
the
very
utmost
and
yet
on
the
morning
of
wednesday
the
when
the
battalion
reached
the
neighborhood
of
scott
shops
every
man
was
in
place
and
ready
for
duty
from
this
point
after
some
ineffectual
efforts
to
get
a
breakfast
the
column
pushed
on
in
the
direction
of
amelia
court
house
at
which
point
colonel
cutshaw
was
ordered
to
report
to
general
james
walker
and
the
battalion
was
thereafter
a
part
of
walker
division
the
was
spent
at
or
near
the
court
house
how
it
is
difficult
to
remember
but
the
day
was
marked
by
several
incidents
worthy
of
record
about
two
hundred
and
muskets
not
enough
to
arm
all
the
men
cartridges
and
caps
were
issued
to
the
battalion
simply
the
muskets
and
ammunition
not
a
belt
or
any
other
convenience
ornamented
the
persons
of
these
infantrymen
they
stored
their
ammunition
in
their
pockets
along
with
their
corn
salt
pipes
and
tobacco
when
application
was
made
for
rations
it
was
found
that
the
last
morsel
belonging
to
the
division
had
been
issued
to
the
command
and
the
battalion
was
again
thrown
on
its
own
resources
to
wit
corn
on
the
cob
intended
for
the
horses
two
ears
were
issued
to
each
man
it
was
parched
in
the
coals
mixed
with
salt
stored
in
the
pockets
and
eaten
on
the
road
chewing
the
corn
was
hard
work
it
made
the
jaws
ache
and
the
gums
and
teeth
so
sore
as
to
cause
almost
unendurable
pain
after
the
muskets
were
issued
a
line
of
battle
was
formed
with
cutshaw
on
the
right
for
what
purpose
the
line
was
formed
the
men
could
not
tell
a
short
distance
from
the
right
of
the
line
there
was
a
grove
which
concealed
an
ammunition
train
which
had
been
sent
from
richmond
to
meet
the
army
the
ammunition
had
been
piled
up
ready
for
destruction
an
occasional
musket
ball
passed
over
near
enough
and
often
enough
to
produce
a
realizing
sense
of
the
proximity
of
the
enemy
and
solemnize
the
occasion
towards
evening
the
muskets
were
stacked
artillery
style
of
course
the
men
were
lying
around
chatting
and
eating
raw
bacon
and
there
was
general
quiet
when
suddenly
the
earth
shook
with
a
tremendous
explosion
and
an
immense
column
of
smoke
rushed
up
into
the
air
to
a
great
height
for
a
moment
there
was
the
greatest
consternation
whole
regiments
broke
and
fled
in
wild
confusion
cutshaw
men
stood
up
seized
their
muskets
and
stood
at
attention
till
it
was
known
that
the
ammunition
had
been
purposely
fired
and
no
enemy
was
threatening
the
line
then
what
laughter
and
hilarity
prevailed
for
a
while
among
these
famishing
men
order
having
been
restored
the
march
was
resumed
and
moving
by
way
of
amelia
springs
the
column
arrived
near
deatonsville
about
ten
on
the
morning
of
thursday
the
the
march
though
not
a
long
one
was
exceedingly
tiresome
as
the
main
roads
being
crowded
the
column
moved
by
plantation
roads
which
were
in
wretched
condition
and
crowded
with
troops
and
trains
that
the
night
was
spent
in
the
most
trying
manner
may
best
be
learned
from
the
fact
that
when
morning
dawned
the
column
was
only
six
or
seven
miles
from
the
starting
point
of
the
evening
before
this
delay
was
fatal
the
whole
army
trains
and
all
left
amelia
court
house
in
advance
of
walker
division
which
was
left
to
cover
the
retreat
cutshaw
battalion
being
the
last
to
leave
the
court
house
thus
bringing
up
the
rear
of
the
army
and
being
in
constant
view
of
the
enemy
hovering
cavalry
the
movement
of
the
division
was
regulated
to
suit
the
movements
of
the
wagon
trains
which
should
have
been
destroyed
on
the
spot
and
the
column
allowed
to
make
its
best
time
as
owing
to
the
delay
they
occasioned
the
army
lost
the
time
it
had
gained
on
the
enemy
in
the
start
and
was
overtaken
the
next
day
at
deatonsville
another
effort
to
cook
was
made
but
before
the
simplest
articles
of
food
could
be
prepared
the
order
to
march
was
given
and
the
battalion
took
the
road
once
more
a
short
while
after
passing
deatonsville
the
column
was
formed
in
line
of
battle
cutshaw
battalion
near
the
road
and
in
an
old
field
with
woods
in
front
and
rear
the
officers
anticipating
an
immediate
attack
ordered
the
men
to
do
what
they
could
for
their
protection
they
immediately
scattered
along
the
fence
on
the
roadside
and
taking
down
the
rails
stalked
back
to
their
position
in
line
laid
the
rails
on
the
ground
and
returned
for
another
load
this
they
continued
to
do
until
the
whole
of
the
fence
was
removed
behind
this
slim
defense
they
silently
awaited
the
advance
of
the
enemy
soon
it
was
decided
that
this
was
not
the
place
to
make
a
stand
the
first
detachment
of
the
second
company
of
richmond
howitzers
and
twenty
men
each
from
garber
and
fry
under
the
command
of
lieutenant
henry
jones
were
left
behind
the
work
with
orders
to
resist
and
retard
the
advance
of
the
enemy
while
the
column
continued
its
march
this
little
band
was
composed
of
true
spirits
the
best
material
in
the
battalion
right
well
did
they
do
their
duty
left
alone
to
face
the
advance
of
the
immense
host
eagerly
pursuing
the
worn
remnant
of
the
invincible
army
they
waited
until
the
enemy
skirmishers
appeared
in
the
field
when
with
perfect
deliberation
they
commenced
their
fire
though
greatly
outnumbered
and
flanked
right
and
left
they
stubbornly
held
on
till
the
line
of
battle
following
the
skirmishers
broke
from
the
woods
and
advancing
rapidly
poured
into
them
a
murderous
volley
and
yet
so
unused
were
they
to
running
they
moved
not
till
the
infantry
skirmishers
had
retired
and
the
word
of
command
was
heard
then
stubbornly
contesting
the
ground
they
fought
their
way
back
through
the
woods
the
gallant
lieutenant
jones
fell
mortally
wounded
having
held
control
of
his
little
band
to
the
moment
he
fell
his
friend
kemp
refused
to
leave
him
and
they
were
captured
together
but
were
immediately
separated
by
the
enemy
pearson
was
pierced
through
by
a
musket
ball
as
he
was
hurrying
through
the
woods
and
fell
heavily
to
the
ground
binford
was
severely
wounded
but
managed
to
escape
hamilton
was
killed
outright
the
battalion
had
left
this
point
but
a
short
time
marching
in
column
of
fours
with
the
division
and
had
reached
the
brow
of
a
gently
sloping
hill
perfectly
open
for
perhaps
a
mile
with
a
broad
valley
on
the
left
and
beyond
it
a
range
of
hills
partly
wooded
in
an
open
space
on
this
range
the
enemy
placed
a
battery
in
position
and
in
anticipation
of
doing
great
slaughter
from
a
safe
distance
opened
a
rapid
fire
on
the
exposed
and
helpless
column
the
shells
came
hurtling
over
the
valley
exploding
in
front
rear
and
overhead
and
tearing
up
the
ground
in
every
direction
ah
how
it
grieved
those
artillerymen
to
stand
musket
in
hand
and
receive
that
shower
of
insolence
how
they
longed
for
the
old
friends
they
had
left
at
fort
clifton
they
knew
how
those
rascals
on
the
other
side
of
the
valley
were
enjoying
the
sport
they
could
hear
in
imagination
the
shouts
of
the
cannoniers
as
they
saw
their
shells
bursting
so
prettily
and
rammed
home
another
shot
illustration
there
was
some
impediment
ahead
and
there
the
column
stood
a
fair
mark
for
these
rascals
there
was
no
help
near
and
all
that
could
be
done
was
to
stand
firm
and
wait
orders
but
help
was
coming
a
cloud
of
dust
was
approaching
from
the
rear
of
the
column
all
eyes
were
strained
to
see
what
it
might
mean
presently
the
artillerymen
recognized
a
sound
a
battery
was
coming
in
full
gallop
the
drivers
lashing
their
horses
and
yelling
like
madmen
the
guns
bounded
along
as
though
they
would
outrun
the
horses
and
with
rush
roar
and
rattle
they
approached
the
front
of
the
battalion
some
fellow
in
the
second
company
howitzers
sung
out
old
henry
carter
hurrah
for
the
third
company
give
it
to
boys
it
was
indeed
the
third
company
of
howitzers
long
separated
from
the
second
with
their
gallant
captain
at
their
head
not
a
moment
was
lost
the
guns
were
in
battery
and
the
smoke
of
the
first
shot
was
curling
about
the
heads
of
the
men
in
the
column
in
marvelously
quick
time
friends
and
comrades
in
the
column
called
to
the
men
at
the
guns
and
they
as
they
stepped
in
and
out
responded
with
cheerful
ringing
voices
hello
bill
how
are
you
joe
bang
pretty
bang
well
i
thank
you
bang
oh
we
giving
it
to
now
bang
as
the
battalion
moved
on
the
gallant
boys
of
the
third
company
finished
their
work
the
disappointed
enemy
limbered
up
slipped
into
the
woods
and
departed
cheered
by
this
fortunate
meeting
with
old
comrades
with
the
pleasant
odor
of
the
smoke
lingering
around
them
these
hitherto
bereft
and
mournful
artillerymen
pushed
on
laughing
at
the
discomfiture
of
the
enemy
and
feeling
that
though
deprived
of
their
guns
by
the
misfortunes
of
war
there
was
still
left
at
least
one
battery
worthy
to
represent
the
artillery
of
the
army
as
the
column
marched
slowly
along
some
man
discovered
three
of
the
enemy
skirmishers
in
a
field
away
on
the
left
more
for
amusement
than
anything
else
it
was
proposed
to
fire
at
them
a
group
of
men
gathered
on
the
roadside
a
volley
was
fired
and
to
the
amazement
of
the
marksmen
for
the
distance
was
great
one
of
the
skirmishers
fell
one
of
his
comrades
started
on
a
run
to
his
assistance
and
he
too
was
stopped
the
third
man
then
scampered
away
as
fast
as
his
legs
could
carry
him
the
battalion
applauded
the
good
shots
and
marched
on
at
sailor
creek
the
detachment
which
had
been
left
at
deatonsville
behind
the
fence
rails
to
watch
and
retard
the
approach
of
the
enemy
having
slowly
retired
before
their
advance
rejoined
the
command
indeed
their
resistance
and
retreat
was
the
beginning
of
and
ended
in
the
battle
of
sailor
creek
the
line
of
battle
was
formed
on
locket
hill
which
sloped
gently
down
from
the
line
to
the
creek
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
or
two
hundred
yards
in
rear
of
and
running
nearly
parallel
with
the
line
of
battle
a
road
divided
the
battalion
near
the
centre
the
howitzers
were
on
the
left
of
this
road
and
in
the
woods
garber
men
were
on
the
right
of
the
howitzers
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
in
a
field
fry
men
on
the
extreme
left
to
cross
the
road
dividing
the
line
was
a
hazardous
experiment
as
the
enemy
thinking
it
an
important
avenue
swept
it
with
musketry
illustration
it
was
amusing
to
see
the
men
hauling
out
of
their
pockets
a
mixture
of
corn
salt
caps
and
cartridges
and
selecting
the
material
needed
loading
they
were
getting
ready
to
stand
they
did
not
expect
to
run
and
did
not
until
ordered
to
do
so
the
enemy
skirmishers
advanced
confidently
and
in
rather
free
and
easy
style
but
suddenly
met
a
volley
which
drove
them
to
cover
again
they
advanced
in
better
order
and
again
the
improvised
infantry
forced
them
back
then
came
their
line
of
battle
with
overwhelming
numbers
but
the
battalion
stubbornly
resisted
their
advance
the
men
not
accustomed
to
the
orderly
manner
of
infantry
dodged
about
from
tree
to
tree
and
with
the
deliberation
of
huntsmen
picked
off
here
and
there
a
man
when
a
shot
told
the
marksman
hurrahed
all
to
himself
there
was
an
evident
desire
to
press
forward
and
drive
the
advancing
foe
several
of
the
men
were
so
enthusiastic
that
they
had
pushed
ahead
of
the
line
and
several
yards
in
advance
they
could
be
seen
loading
and
firing
as
deliberately
as
though
practicing
at
a
mark
colonel
cutshaw
received
a
wound
which
so
shattered
his
leg
that
he
had
to
be
lifted
from
his
horse
into
an
ambulance
he
was
near
being
captured
but
by
hurrying
away
the
ambulance
at
a
gallop
he
escaped
to
a
house
a
short
distance
in
the
rear
where
he
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
the
same
night
he
suffered
amputation
of
a
leg
captain
garber
was
struck
and
called
for
the
ambulance
corps
but
on
examination
found
the
ball
in
his
pocket
it
had
lodged
against
the
rowel
of
a
spur
which
he
found
the
day
before
and
dropped
in
his
pocket
at
last
the
enemy
appeared
in
strong
force
on
both
flanks
while
he
pushed
hard
in
front
it
was
useless
to
attempt
a
further
stand
the
voice
of
captain
jones
of
the
howitzers
rang
out
loud
and
clear
boys
take
care
of
yourselves
saying
this
he
planted
himself
against
a
pine
and
as
his
men
rushed
by
him
emptied
every
chamber
of
his
revolver
at
the
enemy
and
then
reluctantly
made
his
way
in
company
with
several
privates
down
the
hill
to
the
creek
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
a
group
of
perhaps
a
dozen
men
gathered
around
lieutenant
mcrae
he
was
indignant
he
proposed
another
stand
and
his
comrades
agreed
they
stood
in
the
road
facing
the
gentle
slope
of
the
hill
from
which
they
had
been
ordered
to
retire
the
enemy
skirmishers
were
already
on
the
brow
of
the
hill
dodging
about
among
the
trees
and
shouting
to
those
behind
to
hurry
up
their
favorite
expressions

their

out
of

and
for
a
moment
halted

of
the
centre
of
that
portion
of
the
line
which
was
visible
probably
a
full
regimental
front
marched
the
colors
and
mcrae
saw
his
opportunity
he
ordered
his
squad
to
rise
and
fire
on
the
colors
his
order
was
promptly
obeyed
the
pitched
forward
and
fell
with
his
colors
heavily
to
the

the

men
on
either
side

the

into

and
came
swarming
down

they
came
an
officer

rode
his
horse
close
to
the

with
the
most
superb
insolence
mocked
mcrae
and
his
squad
already
as
he
thought
hopelessly
intermingled
with
the
enemy
mcrae
in
his
rage
swore
back
at
him
and
in
the
hearing
of
the
man
called
on
a
man
near
him
to
shoot
that
calling
him
a
fearfully
hard
name
but
the
private
gun
was
not
in
working
order
and
the
fellow
escaped
for
the
time
before
he
reached
the
woods
whither
he
was
going
to
hurry
up
the
boys
a
howitzer
let
fly
at
him
and
at
the
shock
of
the
bullet
stroke
he
threw
his
arms
up
in
the
air
and
his
horse
bore
him
into

little
to

where
the

crossed

the
crack
of

and
the

continuous
the

surrounded

were
mercilessly
shooting

for

up
the
long
open
of
plowed
ground
fired
upon
at
every
step
by
the
swarm
of

behind
and
before
they
reached
the

by
a
battery
in
close
proximity
which
poured
down
a
shower
of

the
race
to

of

was
exceedingly
trying

men
already
exhausted
by
continual
marching
hunger

and

they
ran
panting
for
breath
like
chased
animals
fairly
staggering
as
they
went
on
the
top
of
this
long
hill
there
was
a
skirmish
line
of
cavalry
posted
with
orders
to
stop
all

with
arms
in
their
hands
and
form
a
new
line
but
the
view
down
the
hill
to
the
creek
and
beyond
revealed
such
a
host
of
the
enemy
and
the
men
retiring
before
them
were
so
few
that
the
order
was
disregarded
and
the
fleeing
band
allowed
to
pass
through
the
men
faces
were
black
with
powder
they
had
bitten
cartridges
until
there
was
a
deep
black
circle
around
their
mouths
the
burnt
powder
from
the
ramrods
had
blackened
their
hands
and
in
their
efforts
to
remove
the
perspiration
from
their
faces
they
had
completed
the
coloring
from
the
roots
of
the
hair
to
the
chin
here
was
no
place
for
rest
however
as
the
enemy
battery
behind
the
creek
on
the
opposite
hills
having
gotten
the
range
was
pouring
in
a
lively
fire
soon
after
passing
the
brow
of
the
hill
darkness
came
on
groups
of
men
from
the
battalion
halted
on
the

near

thus
of

from
its

quite
a
number
of
the

got
together
and
in
spite
of
hunger

defeat
and
dreadful
weariness
pushed
on
to
the
high

so
anxious
were
the

to
escape
capture
and
the
insinuation
of
desertion
that
when
threatened
with
shooting
by
the
rear
guard
if
they
did
not
move
on
they
scarcely
turned
to
see
who
spoke
but
the
simple
announcement
the
yankees
are
coming
gave
them
a
little
new
strength
and
again
they
struggled
painfully
along
dropping
in
the
road
sound
asleep
however
at
the
slightest
halt
of
the
column
at
the
bridge
there
was
quite
a
halt
and
in
the
darkness
the
men
commenced
calling
to
each
other
by
name
the
rascally
infantry
around
still
ready
for
fun
answering
for
every
name
brother
called
brother
comrade
called
comrade
friend
called
friend
and
there
were
many
happy
reunions
there
that
night
some
alas
of
the
best
and
bravest
did
not
answer
the
cry
of
anxious
friends
before
the
dawn
of
day
the
column
was
again
in
motion
what
strange
sensations
the
men
had
as
they
marched
slowly
across
the
high
bridge
they
knew
its
great
height
but
the
night
was
so
dark
that
they
could
not
see
the
abyss
on
either
side
arrived
on
the
other
side
the
soldiers
fell
to
the
ground
and
slept
more
dead
than
alive
some
had
slept
as
they
marched
across
the
bridge
and
declared
that
they
had
no
distinct
recollection
of
when
they
left
it
or
how
long
they
were
upon
it
early
on
the
morning
of
the
the
march
was
resumed
and
continued
through
farmville
across
the
bridge
and
to
cumberland
heights
overlooking
the
town
here
on
the
bare
a
line
of
battle
was
formed
for
what
purpose
the
men
did
not
know
the
howitzers
occupying
a
central
place
in
the
line
and
standing
with
their
feet
in
the
midst
of
a
number
of
the
graves
of
soldiers
who
had
perished
in
the
hospitals
in
the
town
while
standing
thus
in
line
a
detail
was
sent
into
the
town
to
hunt
up
some
rations
they
found
a
tierce
of
bacon
surrounded
by
a
ravenous
crowd
fighting
and
quarreling
the
man
on
duty
guarding
the
bacon
was
quickly
overpowered
and
the
bacon
distributed
to
the
crowd
the
detail
secured
a
piece
and
marched
back
triumphantly
to
their
waiting
comrades
after
considerable
delay
the
line
broke
into
column
and
marched
away
in
the
direction
of
curdsville
it
was
on
this
march
that
battalion
showed
itself
proof
against
the
demoralization
which
was
appearing
and
received
almost
from
the
lips
of
the
a
compliment
of
which
any
regiment
in
the
army
might
be
proud
all
along
the
line
of
march
the
enemy
cavalry
followed
close
on
the
flanks
of
the
column
and
whenever
an
opportunity
offered
swooped
down
upon
the
trains
whenever
this
occurred
the
battalion
with
the
division
was
faced
towards
the
advancing
cavalry
and
marched
in
line
to
meet
them
generally
repulsing
them
with
ease
in
one
of
these
attacks
the
cavalry
approached
so
near
the
column
that
a
dash
was
made
at
them
and
the
infantry
returned
to
the
road
with
general
gregg
of
the
enemy
cavalry
a
prisoner
he
was
splendidly
equipped
and
greatly
admired
by
the
ragged
crowd
around
him
he
was
or
pretended
to
be
greatly
surprised
at
his
capture
when
the
column
had
reached
a
point
two
or
three
miles
beyond
farmville
it
was
found
that
the
enemy
was
driving
in
the
force
which
was
protecting
the
marching
column
and
trains
the
troops
hurrying
back
were
all
efforts
to
rally
them
were
vain
and
the
enemy
was
almost
upon
the
column
general
gordon
ordered
general
walker
to
form
his
division
and
drive
the
enemy
back
from
the
road
the
division
advanced
gallantly
and
conspicuous
in
the
charge
was
cutshaw
battalion
when
the
line
was
formed
the
battalion
occupied
rising
ground
on
the
right
the
line
was
visible
for
a
considerable
distance
in
rear
of
the
battalion
there
was
a
group
of
unarmed
men
under
command
of
sergeant
ellett
of
the
howitzers
in
the
distribution
of
muskets
at
amelia
court
house
the
supply
fell
short
of
the
demand
and
this
squad
had
made
the
trip
so
far
unarmed
some
too
had
been
compelled
to
ground
their
arms
at
sailor
creek
a
few
yards
to
the
left
and
rear
of
the
battalion
in
the
road
was
general
lee
surrounded
by
a
number
of
officers
gazing
eagerly
about
him
an
occasional
musket
ball
whistled
over
but
there
was
no
enemy
in
sight
in
the
midst
of
this
quiet
a
general
officer
at
the
left
and
rear
of
the
battalion
fell
from
his
horse
severely
wounded
a
messenger
was
sent
from
the
group
in
the
road
to
ask
the
extent
of
his
injury
after
a
short
while
the
enemy
appeared
and
the
stampeded
troops
came
rushing
by
cutshaw
battalion
stood
firmly
and
quietly
as
if
on
parade
awaiting
orders
general
officers
galloped
about
begging
the
fleeing
men
to
halt
but
in
vain
several
of
the
fugitives
as
they
passed
the
battalion
were
collared
by
the
disarmed
squad
relieved
of
their
muskets
and
ammunition
and
with
a
kick
allowed
to
proceed
to
the
rear
there
was
now
between
the
group
in
the
road
and
the
enemy
only
the
battalion
of
improvised
infantry
there
they
stood
on
the
crest
of
the
hill
in
sharp
relief
not
a
man
moved
from
his
place
did
they
know
the
great
commander
was
watching
them
some
one
said
forward
the
cry
passed
from
lip
to
lip
and
with
cheers
the
battalion
moved
rapidly
to
meet
the
enemy
while
the
field
was
full
of
the
stampeded
troops
making
to
the
rear
a
courier
came
out
with
orders
to
stop
the
advance
but
they
heeded
him
not
again
he
came
but
on
they
went
following
the
line
was
the
unarmed
squad
unable
to
do
more
than
swell
the
volume
of
the
wild
shouts
of
their
comrades
following
them
also
was
the
commissary
department
consisting
of
two
men
with
a
piece
of
bacon
swung
on
a
pole
between
them
yelling
and
hurrahing
as
the
line
advanced
the
sprang
up
and
ran
through
the
like
hares
followed
by
a
shower
of
balls
finally
an
officer
some
say
general
gordon
and
others
an
aide
of
longstreet
rode
out
to
the
front
of
the
battalion
ordered
a
halt
and
in
the
name
of
general
lee
thanked
the
men
for
their
gallant
conduct
and
complimented
them
in
handsome
style
his
words
were
greeted
with
loud
cheers
and
the
battalion
marched
back
to
the
road
carrying
several
prisoners
and
having
retaken
two
pieces
of
artillery
which
had
been
abandoned
to
the
enemy
after
the
enemy
was
driven
back
out
of
reach
of
our
trains
and
column
of
march
and
the
troops
were
in
line
of
battle
general
lee
in
person
rode
up
in
rear
of
the
division
and
addressing
himself
directly
to
the
men
in
ranks
a
thing
very
unusual
with
him
used
language
to
this
effect
that
is
right
men
that
is
all
i
want
you
to
do
just
keep
back
awhile
i
do
not
wish
you
to
expose
yourselves
to
unnecessary
danger
mahone
division
then
coming
up
took
the
place
of
walker
and
the
march
was
resumed
the
battalion
passed
on
the
men
cutting
slices
from
their
piece
of
bacon
and
eagerly
devouring
them
as
night
came
on
the
signs
of
disaster
increased
at
several
places
whole
trains
were
standing
in
the
road
abandoned
artillery
chopped
down
and
burning
blocked
the
way
and
wagonloads
of
ammunition
were
dumped
out
in
the
road
and
trampled
under
foot
there
were
abundant
signs
of
disaster
so
many
muskets
were
dropped
on
the
road
that
cutshaw
unarmed
squad
with
abandoned
muskets
ammunition
and
equipments
there
was
a
halt
during
the
night
in
a
piece
of
stunted
woods
the
land
was
low
and
soggy
in
the
road
passing
through
the
woods
were
several
batteries
chopped
down
and
deserted
there
was
a
little
flour
on
hand
which
had
been
picked
up
on
the
road
an
was
spread
the
flour
placed
on
it
water
was
found
and
the
dough
mixed
then
some
clean
partition
boards
were
knocked
out
of
a
limber
chest
the
dough
was
spread
on
them
and
held
near
the
fire
till
partially
cooked
then
with
what
delight
it
was
devoured
at
daybreak
saturday
the
march
was
resumed
and
continued
almost
without
interruption
during
the
whole
day
the
men
those
whose
gums
and
teeth
were
not
already
too
sore
crunching
parched
corn
and
raw
bacon
as
they
trudged
along
saturday
night
the
battalion
rested
near
appomattox
court
house
in
a
pine
woods
sunday
morning
april
after
a
short
march
the
column
entered
the
village
of
appomattox
court
house
by
what
seemed
to
be
the
main
road
several
dead
men
dressed
in
the
uniform
of
united
states
regular
artillery
were
lying
on
the
roadside
their
faces
turned
up
to
the
blaze
of
the
sun
one
had
a
ghastly
wound
in
the
breast
which
must
have
been
made
by
grape
or
canister
on
through
the
village
without
halting
marched
the
column
whitworth
shots
went
hurtling
through
the
air
every
few
minutes
indicating
very
clearly
that
the
enemy
was
ahead
of
the
column
and
awaiting
its
arrival
on
the
outskirts
of
the
village
the
line
of
battle
was
formed
indeed
there
seemed
to
be
lines
one
slightly
in
advance
of
the
other
wagons
passed
along
the
line
and
dropped
boxes
of
cartridges
the
men
were
ordered
to
knock
them
open
and
supply
themselves
with
forty
rounds
each
they
filled
their
breeches
pockets
to
the
brim
the
general
officers
galloped
up
and
down
the
line
apparently
hurrying
everything
as
much
as
possible
the
shots
from
a
battery
in
advance
were
continually
passing
over
the
line
going
in
the
direction
of
the
village
but
without
harm
to
any
one
the
more
experienced
men
predicted
a
severe
struggle
it
was
supposed
that
this
was
to
be
an
attack
with
the
whole
army
in
mass
for
the
purpose
of
breaking
through
the
line
and
making
one
more
effort
to
move
on
finally
the
order
forward
ran
along
the
line
and
as
it
advanced
the
chiefs
of
detachments
gunners
and
commissioned
officers
marched
in
rear
keeping
up
a
continual
cry
of
close
up
men
close
up
go
ahead
now
do
lag
keep
up
thus
marching
the
line
entered
a
body
of
woods
proceeded
some
distance
changed
direction
to
the
left
and
emerging
from
the
woods
halted
in
a
large
open
field
beyond
which
was
another
body
of
woods
which
concealed
further
view
in
front
after
some
delay
a
detail
for
skirmish
duty
was
ordered
captain
jones
detailed
four
men
fry
and
garber
the
same
number
lieutenant
mcrae
was
placed
in
command
the
infantry
detailed
skirmishers
for
their
front
all
arrangements
completed
the
men
deployed
and
entered
the
woods
they
had
advanced
but
a
short
distance
when
they
encountered
a
strong
line
of
picket
posts
firing
and
cheering
they
rushed
on
the
surprised
men
who
scampered
away
leaving
all
their
little
conveniences
behind
them
and
retreating
for
about
a
mile
from
this
point
large
bodies
of
the
enemy
were
visible
crowding
the
like
a
blue
or
black
cloud
it
was
not
many
minutes
before
a
strong
line
of
dismounted
cavalry
followed
by
mounted
men
deployed
from
this
mass
to
cover
the
retreat
of
their
fleeing
brethren
and
restore
the
picket
line
they
came
down
the
hills
and
across
the
fields
firing
as
they
came
on
looking
around
to
see
what
were
the
chances
for
making
a
stand
lieutenant
mcrae
found
that
the
infantry
skirmishers
had
been
withdrawn
the
officer
who
had
commanded
them
could
be
seen
galloping
away
in
the
distance
the
little
squad
knowing
they
were
alone
kept
up
a
brisk
fire
on
the
advancing
enemy
till
he
was
close
up
in
front
and
well
to
the
rear
of
both
flanks
on
the
left
not
more
than
two
hundred
yards
a
column
of
cavalry
marching
by
twos
had
crossed
the
line
and
were
still
marching
as
unconcernedly
as
possible
to
the
rear
of
mcrae
seeing
this
mcrae
ordered
his
squad
to
retire
saying
at
the
same
time
but
do
let
them
see
you
running
boys
so
they
retired
slowly
stubbornly
and
returning
shot
for
shot
with
the
enemy
who
came
on
at
a
trot
cheering
valiantly
as
they
pursued
four
men
and
a
lieutenant
the
men
dragged
the
butts
of
their
old
muskets
behind
them
loading
as
they
walked
all
loaded
they
turned
halted
fired
received
a
shower
of
balls
in
return
and
then
again
moved
doggedly
to
the
rear
a
little
lieutenant
of
infantry
who
had
been
on
the
skirmish
line
joined
the
squad
he
was
armed
with
a
revolver
and
had
his
sword
by
his
side
stopping
behind
the
corner
of
a
he
swore
he
would
not
go
any
further
to
the
rear
the
squad
moved
on
and
left
him
standing
there
pistol
in
hand
waiting
for
the
enemy
who
were
now
jumping
the
fences
and
coming
across
the
field
running
at
the
top
of
their
speed
what
became
of
this
singular
man
no
one
knows
he
was
as
he
said
determined
to
make
a
stand
a
little
further
on
the
squad
found
a
single
piece
of
artillery
manned
by
a
lieutenant
and
two
or
three
men
they
were
selecting
individuals
in
the
enemy
skirmish
line
and
at
them
with
solid
lieutenant
mcrae
laughed
at
the
ridiculous
sight
remonstrated
with
the
officer
and
offered
his
squad
to
serve
the
gun
if
there
was
any
canister
in
the
limber
chest
the
offer
was
refused
and
again
the
squad
moved
on
passing
a
about
this
time
the
squad
halted
to
look
with
horror
upon
several
dead
and
wounded
confederates
who
lay
there
upon
the
manure
pile
they
had
suffered
wounds
and
death
upon
this
the
last
day
of
their
country
struggle
their
wounds
had
received
no
attention
and
those
living
were
famished
and
burning
with
fever
lieutenant
mcrae
noticing
a
number
of
wagons
and
guns
parked
in
a
field
near
by
surprised
at
what
he
considered
great
carelessness
in
the
immediate
presence
of
the
enemy
approached
an
officer
on
horseback
and
said
in
his
usual
impressive
manner
i
say
there
what
does
this
mean
the
man
took
his
hand
and
quietly
said
we
have
surrendered
i
do
believe
it
sir
replied
mcrae
strutting
around
as
mad
as
a
hornet
you
must
talk
so
sir
you
will
demoralize
my
men
he
was
soon
convinced
however
by
seeing
yankee
cavalrymen
walking
their
horses
around
as
composedly
as
though
the
army
of
northern
virginia
had
never
existed
to
say
that
mcrae
was
surprised
disgusted
indignant
and
incredulous
is
a
mild
way
of
expressing
his
state
of
mind
as
he
turned
to
his
squad
and
said
well
boys
it
must
be
so
it
very
strange
let
move
on
and
see
about
it
as
though
dreaming
the
squad
and
the
disgusted
officer
moved
on
learning
that
the
army
had
gone
into
camp
the
skirmishers
went
on
in
the
direction
of
the
village
and
found
the
battalion
in
the
woods
near
the
main
road
fires
were
burning
and
those
who
had
been
fortunate
enough
to
find
anything
eatable
were
cooking
federal
troops
were
riding
up
and
down
the
road
and
loafing
about
the
camps
trying
to
be
familiar
they
seemed
to
think
that
how
are
you
johnny
spoken
in
condescending
style
was
sufficient
introduction
during
the
day
a
line
of
men
came
single
file
over
the
hill
near
the
camp
each
bearing
on
his
shoulder
a
box
of
hardtack
or
crackers
behind
these
came
a
beef
driven
by
soldiers
the
crackers
and
beef
were
a
present
from
the
federal
troops
near
who
knowing
the
famishing
condition
of
the
surrounded
army
had
contributed
their
day
rations
for
its
relief
all
honor
to
them
it
was
a
soldierly
act
which
was
thoroughly
appreciated
the
beef
was
immediately
shot
and
butchered
and
before
the
animal
heat
had
left
the
meat
it
was
impaled
in
little
strips
on
sticks
bayonets
swords
and
and
roasting
over
the
fires
though
numbers
of
the
enemy
visited
the
camps
and
plied
the
men
with
all
sorts
of
questions
seeming
very
curious
and
inquisitive
not
an
unkind
word
was
said
on
either
side
that
day
when
the
skirmishers
under
mcrae
entered
the
camp
of
the
battalion
their
enthusiastic
descriptions
of
driving
the
enemy
and
being
driven
in
turn
failed
to
produce
any
effect
many
of
the
men
were
sobbing
and
crying
like
children
recovering
from
convulsions
of
grief
after
a
severe
whipping
they
were
sorely
grieved
mortified
and
humiliated
of
course
they
had
not
the
slightest
conception
of
the
numbers
of
the
enemy
who
surrounded
them
other
men
fairly
raved
with
indignation
and
declared
their
desire
to
escape
or
die
in
the
attempt
but
not
a
man
was
heard
to
blame
general
lee
on
the
contrary
all
expressed

the

he
held
in
higher
veneration
or
regarded
with
more
sincere
affection
than
on
that
sad
and
tearful
day
in
the
afternoon
the
little
remnant
of
the
army
was
massed
in
a
field
general
gordon
spoke
to
them
most
eloquently
and
bade
them
farewell
general
walker
addressed
his
division
to
which
cutshaw
battalion
was
attached
bidding
them
farewell
in
the
course
of
his
remarks
he
denounced
fiercely
the
men
who
had
thrown
down
their
arms
on
the
march
and
called
upon
the
true
men
before
him
to
go
home
and
tell
their
wives
mothers
sisters
and
sweethearts
how
shamefully
these
cowards
had
behaved

also
spoke
sitting
on
his
horse
and
bending
forward
over
the
pommel
of
his
saddle
referring
to
the
surrender
he
said
i
would
rather
have
embraced
the
tabernacle
of
death
there
were
many
heaving
bosoms
and
faces
during
the
speaking
a
tall
manly
fellow
with
his
colors
pressed
to
his
side
stood
near

convulsed
with
grief
the
speaking

dispersed
and
once
more
the
burned
brightly
night
brought
rest
the
heroes
of
many
battles
the
conquerors
of
human
nature
cravings
the
brave
old
army
fell
asleep
securely
guarded
by
the
encircling
hosts
of
the
enemy
who
will
write
the
history
of
that
march
who
will
be
able
to
tell
the
story

how
many

i
need
not
tell
the
brave

of

many
battles
who
have
remained
steadfast
to
the
last
that
i
have
consented
to
this

from
no

feeling
that
valor

devotion
could
accomplish
nothing
that
would
compensate
for
the
loss
that
must
have
attended

had
in

personified
the

of
his

and
now
bore
its
grief
in
his

the
signal
for
tearful
partings
comrades
wept
as
they
gazed
upon
each
other
and
with
choking
voices
said
farewell
and
so
they
parted
little
groups
of
two
or
three
or
four
without
food
without
money
but
with
the
satisfaction
that
proceeds
from
the
consciousness
of
duty
faithfully
performed

plodding
their
way
homeward
chapter
ix
brave
survivors
homeward
bound
bitter
grief
for
the
past
which
seemed
to
be
forever
lost
and
present
humiliation
could
not
long
suppress
the
anxious
thought
and
question
what
now
the
discussion
of
the
question
brought
relief
from
the
horrid
feeling
of
vacuity
which
oppressed
the
soldier
and
introduced
him
to
the
new
sensations
of
liberty
of
choice
freedom
of
action
full
responsibility
for
capital
he
had
a
clear
conscience
a
brave
heart
health
strength
and
a
good
record
with
these
he
sought
his
home
early
in
the
morning
of
wednesday
the
of
april
without
the
stirring
drum
or
the
bugle
call
of
old
the
camp
awoke
to
the
new
life
whether
or
not
they
had
a
country
these
soldiers
did
not
know
home
to
many
when
they
reached
it
was
graves
and
ashes
at
any
rate
there
must
be
somewhere
on
earth
a
better
place
than
a
muddy
smoky
camp
in
a
piece
of
scrubby
pines
better
company
than
gloomy
hungry
comrades
and
inquisitive
enemies
and
something
in
the
future
more
exciting
if
not
more
hopeful
than
nothing
to
eat
nowhere
to
sleep
nothing
to
do
and
nowhere
to
go
the
disposition
to
start
was
apparent
and
the
preparations
were
promptly
begun
to
roll
up
the
old
blanket
and
gather
up
the
haversack
canteen
axe
perhaps
and
a
few
trifles
in
time
of
peace
of
no
value
eat
the
fragments
that
remained
and
light
a
pipe
was
the
work
of
a
few
moments
this
slight
employment
coupled
with
pleasant
anticipations
of
the
unknown
and
therefore
possibly
enjoyable
future
served
to
restore
somewhat
the
usual
manner
of
soldiers
and
relieve
the
final
farewells
of
much
of
their
sadness
there
was
even
a
smack
of
hope
and
cheerfulness
as
the
little
groups
sallied
out
into
the
world
to
combat
they
scarcely
knew
what
as
we
can
not
follow
all
these
groups
we
will
join
ourselves
to
one
and
see
them
home
two
whose
objective
point
is
richmond
take
the
road
on
foot
they
have
nothing
to
eat
and
no
money
they
are
bound
for
their
home
in
a
city
which
when
they
last
heard
from
it
was
in
flames
what
they
will
see
when
they
arrive
there
they
can
not
imagine
but
the
instinctive
love
of
home
urges
them
they
walk
on
steadily
and
rapidly
and
are
not
diverted
by
surroundings
it
does
not
even
occur
to
them
that
their
situation
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
armed
enemies
and
walking
a
road
crowded
with
them
is
at
all
novel
they
are
suddenly
roused
to
a
sense
of
their
situation
by
a
sharp
halt
show
your
parole
they
had
struck
the
cordon
of
picket
posts
which
surrounded
the
surrendered
army
it
was
the
first
exercise
of
authority
by
the
federal
army
a
sergeant
accompanied
by
a
couple
of
muskets
stepped
into
the
road
with
a
modest
air
examined
the
paroles
and
said
quietly
pass
on
the
strictly
military
part
of
the
operation
being
over
the
social
commenced
as
the
two
survivors
moved
on
they
were
followed
by
numerous
remarks
such
as
hello
johnny
i
say
going
home
ai
you
glad
they
made
no
reply
these
wayfarers
but
they
some
very
from
this
point
on
to
richmond
was
the
grand
thought
steady
work
it
was
the
road
strangely
enough
considering
the
proximity
of
two
armies
was
quite
lonesome
and
not
an
incident
of
interest
occurred
during
the
day
darkness
found
the
two
comrades
still
pushing
on
some
time
after
dark
a
light
was
seen
a
short
distance
ahead
and
there
was
a
sound
of
revelry
on
approaching
the
light
was
found
to
proceed
from
a
large
fire
built
on
the
floor
of
an
old
and
dilapidated
outhouse
and
surrounded
by
a
ragged
hungry
singing
and
jolly
crowd
of
paroled
prisoners
of
the
army
of
northern
virginia
who
had
gotten
possession
of
a
quantity
of
corn
meal
and
were
waiting
for
the
then
in
the
ashes
being
liberal
they
offered
the
some
of
their
bread
being
hungry
the
survivors
accepted
and
eat
their
first
meal
that
day
here
seemed
a
good
place
to
spend
the
night
but
the
party
in
possession
were
so
noisy
and
finally
so
quarrelsome
and
disagreeable
generally
that
the
survivors
after
a
short
rest
pushed
on
in
the
darkness
determined
if
possible
to
find
some
shelter
more
quiet
the
result
was
a
night
march
which
was
continued
till
the
morning
dawned
thursday
morning
they
entered
the
village
of
buckingham
court
house
and
traded
a
small
pocket
mirror
for
a
substantial
breakfast
there
was
quite
a
crowd
of
soldiers
gathered
around
a
cellar
door
trying
to
persuade
an
commissary
of
subsistence
that
he
might
as
well
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
army
had
surrendered
let
them
have
some
of
his
stores
and
after
considerable
persuasion
and
some
threats
he
relinquished
the
hope
of
keeping
them
for
himself
and
told
the
men
to
help
themselves
they
did
so
the
people
of
the
village
did
not
exactly
doubt
the
of
the
surrender
but
evidently
thought
matters
had
been
facts
suppressed
and
everything
allowed
to
fall
into
a
very
doubtful
condition
confederate
money
would
not
pass
however
was
settled
as
the
two
tramps
were
about
to
leave
the
village
and
were
hurrying
along
the
high
road
which
led
through
it
they
saw
a
solitary
horseman
approaching
from
their
rear
it
was
easy
to
recognize
at
once
general
lee
he
rode
slowly
calmly
along
as
he
passed
an
old
tavern
on
the
roadside
some
ladies
and
children
waved
their
handkerchiefs
smiled
and
wept
the
general
turned
his
eyes
to
the
porch
on
which
they
stood
and
slowly
putting
his
hand
to
his
hat
raised
it
slightly
and
as
slowly
again
dropped
his
hand
to
his
side
the
survivors
did
not
weep
but
they
had
strange
sensations
they
pushed
on
steering
so
to
speak
for
cartersville
and
the
ferry
before
leaving
the
village
it
was
the
sad
duty
of
the
survivors
to
stop
at
the
humble
abode
of
and
tell
her
of
the
death
of
her
husband
who
fell
mortally
wounded
pierced
by
a
musket
ball
near
sailor
creek
she
was
also
told
that
a
comrade
who
was
by
his
side
when
he
fell
but
who
was
not
able
to
stay
with
him
would
come
along
soon
and
give
her
the
particulars
that
comrade
came
and
repeated
the
story
in
a
few
days
the
dead
man
reached
home
alive
and
scarcely
hurt
he
was
originally
an
infantryman
recently
transferred
to
artillery
and
therefore
wore
a
small
knapsack
as
infantrymen
did
the
ball
struck
the
knapsack
with
a
whack
and
knocked
the
man
down
that
was
all
some
time
during
the
night
the
travelers
reached
the
ferry
at
cartersville
darkness
and
silence
prevailed
there
loud
and
continued
shouts
brought
no
ferryman
and
eager
searchings
revealed
no
boat
the
depth
of
the
water
being
a
thing
unknown
and
not
easily
found
out
it
was
obviously
prudent
to
camp
for
the
night
on
the
river
edge
there
was
an
old
building
which
seemed
a
brick
one
one
wall
near
the
water
edge
a
flight
of
steep
rough
steps
led
to
an
open
door
on
the
second
floor
up
these
steps
climbed
the
weary
men
inside
there
was
absolute
darkness
but
there
was
shelter
from
the
wind
feeling
about
on
the
floor
they
satisfied
themselves
of
its
cleanliness
and
dryness
the
faithful
old
blankets
were
once
more
spread
their
owners
laid
down
and
at
once
fell
into
a
deep
sleep
which
was
not
broken
till
morning
the
room
was
surprisingly
small
when
the
soldiers
entered
they
had
no
idea
of
the
size
of
it
and
went
to
sleep
with
the
impression
that
it
was
very
large
the
morning
revealed
its
dimensions
about
ten
by
twelve
feet
the
ferryman
was
early
at
his
post
and
put
the
travelers
across
cheerfully
without
charge
illustration
any
buttermilk
aunty
soon
after
crossing
a
good
bearing
the
monogram
of
one
of
the
travelers
purchased
from
an
aged
colored
woman
a
large
chunk
of
and
about
half
a
gallon
of
buttermilk
this
old
darkey
had
lived
in
richmond
in
her
younger
days
she
spoke
of
grown
men
and
women
there
as
children
whar
i
raised

god
bless
you
honey
a
big
log
on
the
roadside
furnished
a
seat
for
the
comfortable
consumption
of
the
and
milk
the
feast
was
hardly
begun
when
the
tramp
of
a
horse
hoofs
was
heard
looking
up
the
survivors
saw
with
surprise
general
lee
approaching
he
was
entirely
alone
and
rode
slowly
along
unconscious
that
any
one
saw
him
he
was
yet
erect
dignified
and
apparently
as
calm
and
peaceful
as
the
fields
and
woods
around
him
having
caught
sight
of
the
occupants
of
the
log
he
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
them
and
as
he
passed
turned
slightly
saluted
and
said
in
the
most
gentle
manner
good
morning
gentlemen
taking
your
breakfast
the
soldiers
had
only
time
to
rise
salute
and
say
yes
sir
and
he
was
gone
having
finished
as
far
as
they
were
able
the
abundant
meal
furnished
by
the
liberality
of
the
good
old
mammy
the
travelers
resumed
their
journey
greatly
refreshed
it
seems
that
general
lee
pursued
the
road
which
the
survivors
chose
and
starting
later
than
they
overtook
them
he
being
mounted
and
they
on
foot
at
any
rate
it
was
their
good
fortune
to
see
him
three
times
between
appomattox
and
richmond
the
incidents
introducing
general
lee
are
peculiarly
interesting
and
while
the
writer
is
in
doubt
as
to
the
on
which
the
next
and
last
incident
occurred
the
reader
may
rest
assured
of
the
truthfulness
of
the
narration
illustration
good
morning
gentlemen
about
the
time
when
men
who
have
eaten
a
hearty
breakfast
become
again
hungry
as
good
fortune
would
have
it
happen
the
travellers
reached
a
house
pleasantly
situated
and
a
comfortable
place
withal
approaching
the
house
they
were
met
by
an
exceedingly
kind
energetic
and
hospitable
woman
she
promptly
asked
you
are
not
deserters
no
said
the
soldiers
we
have
our
paroles
we
are
from
richmond
we
are
homeward
bound
and
called
to
ask
if
you
could
spare
us
a
dinner
spare
you
a
dinner
certainly
i
can
my
husband
is
a
miller
his
mill
is
right
across
the
road
there
down
the
hill
and
i
have
been
cooking
all
day
for
the
poor
starving
men
take
a
seat
on
the
porch
there
and
i
will
get
you
something
to
eat
by
the
time
the
travelers
were
seated
this
admirable
woman
was
in
the
kitchen
at
work
the
pat
pat
pat
of
the
sifter
and
the
cracking
and
fizzing
of
the
fat
bacon
as
it
fried
saluted
their
hungry
ears
and
the
delicious
smell
tickled
their
olfactory
nerves
most
delightfully
sitting
thus
entertained
by
delightful
sounds
breathing
the
fragrant
air
and
wrapped
in
meditation
or
anticipation
rather
the
soldiers
saw
the
dust
rise
in
the
air
and
heard
the
sound
of
an
approaching
party
several
horsemen
rode
up
to
the
threw
their
bridles
over
the
posts
or
tied
to
the
overhanging
boughs
and
dismounted
they
were
evidently
officers
well
dressed
fine
looking
men
and
about
to
enter
the
gate
almost
at
once
the
men
on
the
porch
recognized
general
lee
and
his
son
an
ambulance
had
arrived
at
the
gate
also
without
delay
the
party
entered
and
approached
the
house
general
lee
preceding
the
others
satisfied
that
it
was
the
general
intention
to
enter
the
house
the
two
brave
survivors
instinctively
and
respectfully
venerating
the
approaching
man
determined
to
give
him
and
his
companions
the
porch
as
they
were
executing
a
rather
rapid
and
undignified
flank
movement
to
gain
the
right
and
rear
of
the
house
the
voice
of
general
lee
overhauled
them
thus
where
are
you
men
going
this
lady
has
offered
to
give
us
a
dinner
and
we
are
waiting
for
it
replied
the
soldiers
well
you
had
better
move
on
now
this
gentleman
will
have
quite
a
large
party
on
him
said
the
general
the
soldiers
touched
their
caps
said
yes
sir
and
retired
somewhat
hurt
to
a
strong
position
on
a
hencoop
in
the
rear
of
the
house
the
party
then
settled
on
the
porch
the
general
had
of
course
no
authority
and
the
surrender
of
the
porch
was
purely
respectful
knowing
this
the
soldiers
were
at
first
hurt
but
a
moment
reflection
satisfied
them
that
the
general
was
right
he
suspicions
of
and
these
were
increased
by
the
movement
of
the
men
to
the
rear
as
he
approached
he
their
the
lady
of
the
house
reward
for
her
hearing
the
dialogue
in
the
yard
pushed
her
head
through
the
crack
of
the
kitchen
door
and
as
she
tossed
a
lump
of
dough
from
hand
to
hand
and
gazed
eagerly
out
addressed
the
soldiers
ai
that
old
general
lee
yes
general
lee
and
his
son
and
other
officers
come
to
dine
with
you
they
replied
well
she
said
he
ai
no
better
than
the
men
that
fought
for
him
and
i
do
reckon
he
is
as
hungry
so
you
just
come
in
here
i
am
going
to
give
you
yours
first
and
then
i
get
something
for
him
what
a
meal
it
was
seated
at
the
kitchen
table
the
woman
bustling
about
and
talking
away
the
ravenous
tramps
attacked
a
pile
of
old
virginia
and
a
frying
pan
with
an
inch
of
gravy
and
slices
of
bacon
streak
of
lean
and
streak
of
fat
very
numerous
to
finish
as
much
rich
buttermilk
as
the
drinkers
could
contain
with
many
heartfelt
thanks
the
survivors
bid
farewell
to
this
immortal
woman
and
leaving
the
general
and
his
party
in
quiet
possession
of
the
front
porch
pursued
their
way
night
found
the
survivors
at
the
gate
of
a
quite
handsome
framed
country
residence
the
weather
was
threatening
and
it
was
desirable
to
have
shelter
as
well
as
rest
entering
and
knocking
at
the
door
they
were
met
by
a
servant
girl
she
was
sent
to
her
mistress
with
a
request
for
permission
to
sleep
on
her
premises
the
servant
returned
saying
mistis
say
she
a
widder
and
there
ai
no
gentleman
in
the
house
and
she
ca
let
you
come
in
she
was
sent
with
a
second
message
which
informed
the
lady
that
the
visitors
were
from
richmond
members
of
a
certain
company
from
there
and
would
be
content
to
sleep
on
the
porch
in
the
stable
or
in
the
barn
they
would
protect
her
property
etc
this
brought
the
lady
of
the
house
to
the
door
she
said
if
you
are
members
of
the
you
must
know
my
nephew
he
was
in
that
company
of
course
they
knew
him
old
chum
comrade
particular
friend
splendid
fellow
hope
he
was
well
when
you
heard
from
him
glad
to
meet
you
madam
these
and
similar
hearty
expressions
brought
the
longed
for
come
in
gentlemen
you
are
welcome
i
will
see
that
supper
is
prepared
for
you
at
once
invitation
accepted
the
old
haversacks
were
deposited
in
a
corner
under
the
steps
and
their
owners
conducted
to
a
spacious
quite
prettily
furnished
a
large
table
occupied
the
centre
of
the
room
and
at
one
side
there
was
a
handsome
display
of
silver
in
a
case
a
good
big
fire
lighted
the
room
the
lady
sat
quietly
working
at
some
woman
work
and
from
time
to
time
questioning
in
a
manner
her
guests
their
correct
answers
satisfied
her
and
their
respectful
manner
reassured
her
so
that
by
the
time
supper
was
brought
in
she
was
chatting
and
laughing
with
her
defenders
the
supper
came
in
steaming
hot
it
was
abundant
well
prepared
and
served
elegantly
splendid
coffee
hot
biscuit
luscious
butter
fried
ham
eggs
fresh
milk
the
writer
could
not
expect
to
be
believed
if
he
should
tell
the
quantity
eaten
at
that
meal
the
good
lady
of
the
house
enjoyed
the
sight
she
relished
every
mouthful
and
no
doubt
realized
then
and
there
the
blessing
which
is
conferred
on
hospitality
and
the
truth
of
that
saying
of
old
it
is
more
blessed
to
give
than
to
receive
the
wayfarers
were
finally
shown
to
a
neat
little
chamber
the
bed
was
soft
and
glistening
white
too
white
and
clean
to
be
soiled
by
the
occupancy
of
two
confederate
soldiers
who
had
not
had
a
change
of
underclothing
for
many
weeks
they
looked
at
it
felt
of
it
spread
their
old
blankets
on
the
neat
carpet
and
slept
there
till
near
the
break
of
day
while
it
was
yet
dark
the
travelers
unwilling
to
lose
time
waiting
for
breakfast
crept
out
of
the
house
leaving
their
thanks
for
their
kind
hostess
and
pressed
rapidly
on
to
manikin
town
on
the
james
river
and
kanawha
canal
half
a
day
march
from
richmond
where
they
arrived
while
it
was
yet
early
morning
the
green
sward
between
the
canal
and
river
was
inviting
and
the
survivors
laid
there
awhile
to
rest
and
determine
whether
or
not
they
would
push
on
to
the
city
they
decided
to
do
so
as
soon
as
they
could
find
a
breakfast
to
fit
them
for
the
march
a
short
walk
placed
them
at
the
yard
gate
of
a
house
prominent
by
reason
of
its
size
and
finish
everything
indicated
comfort
plenty
and
freedom
from
the
ravages
of
war
the
proprietor
a
hearty
man
of
not
more
than
or
three
who
as
a
soldier
could
tell
at
a
glance
had
never
seen
a
day
service
stood
behind
the
tall
gate
and
without
a
motion
towards
opening
it
replied
to
the
cheery
good
morning
sir
of
the
soldiers
with
a
sullen
morn
what
do
you
want
here
we
are
from
richmond
sir
members
of
the
we
are
on
our
way
home
from
appomattox
where
the
army
was
surrendered
and
called
to
ask
if
you
could
spare
us
something
to
eat
before
we
start
on
the
day
march
oh
yes
know
about
the
surrender
do
some
scoundrels
were
here
last
night
and
stole
my
best
mare
d
no
i
do
want
any
more
of
such
cattle
here
replied
the
patriot
a
reward
for
name
the
foragers
having
worked
for
a
meal
before
and
being
less
sensitive
than
penniless
gentlemen
sometimes
are
replied
are
not
or
beggars
if
you
do
not
feel
that
it
would
be
a
pleasure
and
a
privilege
to
feed
us
do
we
do
propose
to
press
the
matter
at
last
he
said
come
in
then
i
see
what
i
can
do
the
seekers
after
food
accepted
the
ungracious
invitation
followed
the
dog
through
his
yard
and
into
his
house
and
took
seats
at
his
table
at
a
signal
from
the
master
a
servant
went
out
the
host
followed
and
it
is
supposed
instructed
her
the
host
returned
and
was
soon
followed
by
the
servant
bearing
two
plates
which
were
placed
before
the
survivors
alas
that
they
should
survive
to
see
that
the
plates
contained
the
heads
tails
fins
and
vertebr√¶
of
the
fish
fresh
from
the
river
which
the
family
of
this
hero
and
sufferer
from
the
evils
of
war
had
devoured
at
their
early
and
no
doubt
cozy
breakfast
survivor
no
looked
at
survivor
no
survivor
no
looked
at

no
and
simultaneously
they
rose
to
their
feet
glanced
at
the
host
and
strode
to
and
out
of
the
door
the
host
followed
amazed
what
the
matter
gentlemen
you
did
not
eat
the
poor
soldiers
replied
no
we
did
eat
we
are
not
dogs
permit
us
to
say
we
are
satisfied
it
would
be
an
injustice
to
the
canine
race
to
call
one
you
deserve
to
lose
another
mare
you
are
meaner
than
any
epithets
at
our
command
the
man
fairly
trembled
his
face
was
pale
with
rage
but
he
dared
not
reply
as
he
would
recovering
himself
and
seeing
an
odorous
name
in
the
future
he
attempted
apology
and
reparation
for
the
insult
and
complete
reconciliation
oh
come
in
come
in
i
have
something
cooked
for
you
sorry
the
mistake
occurred
all
right
all
right
boys
come
in
pulling
and
patting
the
boys
but
the
boys
would
go
in
on
the
contrary
they
stayed
out
persistently
and
before
they
left
that
gate
heaped
on
its
owner
all
the
contempt
disdain
and
scorn
which
they
could
express
flung
at
him
all
the
derisive
epithets
which
four
years
in
the
army
places
at
a
man
disposal
pooh
poohed
at
his
hypocritical
regrets
and
shaking
off
the
dust
of
that
place
from
their
feet
pushed
on
to
the
city
the
smoke
of
which
rose
to
heaven
at
eleven
of
the
same
day
two
footsore
despondent
and
penniless
men
stood
facing
the
ruins
of
the
home
of
a
comrade
who
had
sent
a
message
to
his
mother
tell
mother
i
am
coming
the
ruins
yet
smoked
a
relative
of
the
lady
whose
home
was
in
ashes
and
whose
son
said
i
am
coming
stood
by
the
survivors
well
then
he
said
it
must
be
true
that
general
lee
has
surrendered
the
solemnity
of
the
remark
coupled
with
the
certainty
in
the
minds
of
the
survivors
was
almost
amusing
the
relative
pointed
out
the
temporary
residence
of
the
mother
and
thither
the
survivors
wended
their
way
a
knock
at
the
door
startled
the
mother
and
with
agony
in
her
eyes
she
appeared
at
the
open
door
exclaiming
my
poor
boys
are
safe
and
coming
home
said
the
survivors
thank
god
said
the
mother
and
the
tears
flowed
down
her
cheeks
a
rapid
walk
through
ruined
and
smoking
streets
some
narrow
escapes
from
negro
soldiers
on
police
duty
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
two
of
the
boys
in
blue
hung
up
by
their
thumbs
for
pillaging
a
few
handshakings
and
the
survivors
found
their
way
to
the
house
of
a
relative
where
they
did
eat
bread
with
thanks
a
friend
informed
the
survivors
that
farm
hands
were
needed
all
around
the
city
they
made
a
note
of
the
name
of
one
farmer
saturday
night
the
old
blankets
were
spread
on
the
parlor
floor
sunday
morning
the
of
april
they
bid
farewell
to
the
household
and
started
for
the
farmer
house
as
they
were
about
to
start
away
the
head
of
the
family
took
from
his
pocket
a
handful
of
odd
silver
pieces
and
extending
it
to
his
guests
told
them
it
was
all
he
had
but
they
were
to
half
of
remembering
that
he
had
a
wife
and
three
or
four
children
to
feed
the
soldiers
smiled
through
tears
at
his
bade
him
keep
it
all
and
weep
for
himself
rather
than
for
them
so
saying
they
departed
and
at
sundown
were
at
the
farmer
house
fourteen
miles
away
monday
morning
the
they
beat
their
swords
muskets
in
this
case
into
and
did
the
first
day
work
of
the
which
the
simple
farmer
secured
at
a
cost
to
himself
of
about
for
two
men
behold
the
gratitude
of
a
people
chapter
x
soldiers
transformed
sunday
night
april
the
two
survivors
sat
down
to
a
cozy
supper
at
the
farmer
house
plentiful
it
was
and
to
hungry
travelers
sweet
and
satisfying
the
presence
of
the
farmer
wife
and
children
two
lady
refugees
and
an
old
gentleman
who
was
also
a
refugee
added
greatly
to
the
novelty
and
pleasure
of
the
meal
after
supper
the
soldiers
were
plied
with
questions
till
they
were
almost
overcome
by
fatigue
and
about
to
fall
asleep
in
their
chairs
at
last
the
farmer
with
many
apologies
led
them
kindly
to
the
best
room
in
the
house
the
parlor
where
they
spread
their
blankets
on
the
carpeted
floor
and
were
soon
sound
asleep
in
the
morning
the
breakfast
was
enough
to
craze
a
confederate
soldier
fresh
butter
eggs
milk
fried
bacon
coffee
after
the
breakfast
business
the
farmer
proposed
to
feed
and
lodge
the
soldiers
and
pay
them
eleven
dollars
monthly
for
such
manual
labor
as
they
could
perform
on
his
farm
the
soldiers
having
in
remembrance
the
supper
and
breakfast
accepted
the
terms
the
new
hands
were
now
led
to
the
garden
where
the
farmer
had
half
an
acre
plowed
up
and
each
was
furnished
with
an
old
dull
hoe
with
crooked
knotty
handles
the
farmer
then
with
blushes
and
stammering
explained
that
he
desired
to
have
each
particular
clod
chopped
up
fine
with
the
hoe
the
soldiers
town
men
thought
this
an
almost
superhuman
task
and
a
great
waste
of
time
but
so
that
the
work
procured
food
they
cared
not
what
the
work
might
be
and
at
it
they
went
with
a
will
all
that
morning
until
the
dinner
hour
those
two
hoes
rose
and
fell
as
regularly
as
the
pendulum
of
a
clock
swings
from
side
to
side
and
almost
as
fast
the
negro
men
and
women
in
the
neighborhood
now
in
the
full
enjoyment
of
liberty
and
consequently
having
no
thought
of
doing
any
work
congregated
about
the
garden
leaned
on
the
fence
gazed
sleepily
at
the
toiling
soldiers
chuckled
now
and
then
and
occasionally
explained
their
presence
by
remarking
to
each
other
come
here
to
see
dem
dar
white
folks
wuckin
there
were
onions
growing
in
that
garden
which
the
soldiers
were
glad
to
pull
up
and
eat
it
was
angel
food
to
men
who
had
fed
for
months
on
salt
bacon
and
corn
bread
without
one
mouthful
of
any
green
thing
when
dinner
time
came
the
hands
were
to
say
the
least
very
decidedly
hungry
illustration
see
dem
white
folks
wuckin
figured
prominently
again
and
the
soldiers
found
great
difficulty
in
exercising
any
deliberation
in
the
eating
of
them
it
really
seemed
to
them
that
were
it
reasonable
behavior
they
could
devour
every
morsel
provided
for
the
entire
family
but
when
they
had
devoured
about
two
thirds
of
all
there
was
to
eat
and
the
host
said
have
another
biscuit
they
replied
no
thank
you
greatest
plenty
all
the
while
as
hungry
as
when
they
sat
down
it
was
only
a
question
of
was
to
be
hungry
the
soldiers
or
the
children
there
was
not
enough
for
all
after
dinner
the
survivors
went
again
to
the
garden
and
chopped
those
clods
of
earth
until
the
merry
voice
of
the
farmer
called
them
to
supper
at
supper
there
was
a
profusion
of
flowers
which
the
kind
lady
of
the
house
explained
were
there
to
cheer
the
soldiers
she
had
noticed
they
were
sad
and
hoped
that
this
little
attention
would
cheer
them
but
the
thing
the
soldiers
most
needed
to
enliven
them
was
more
to
eat
they
were
not
feeling
romantic
at
all
after
the
supper
the
whole
family
adjourned
to
the
parlor
and
were
entertained
with
some
good
piano
playing
and
homespun
duets
and
solos
the
veterans
added
their
mite
to
the
entertainment
in
the
shape
of
a
tolerably
fair
tenor
and
an
intolerable
bass
singing
in
the
open
air
with
a
male
chorus
is
not
the
best
preparation
for
a
parlor
mixed
quartette
when
the
war
ceased
the
negroes
on
the
farm
had
left
their
quarters
and
gone
out
in
search
of
a
glorious
something
which
they
had
heard
described
as
liberty
freedom
manhood
and
the
like
consequently
the
quarters
suggested
themselves
to
the
farmer
as
a
good
place
for
the
new
field
hands
to
occupy
for
sleeping
apartments
they
were
carried
to
an
and
shown
their
room
ten
by
fifteen
feet
unplastered
greasy
and
dusty
the
odor
of
the
man
and
brother
did
cling
there
still
a
bench
a
stool
an
old
rickety
bedstead
and
a
bed
of
straw
completed
the
fitting
out
of
the
room
save
for
the
shelter
of
the
roof
anywhere
in
the
fields
would
have
been
far
preferable
the
first
night
disclosed
the
presence
of
fleas
in
abundance
and
other
things
worse
while
it
was
yet
dark
the
farmer
still
somewhat
embarrassed
by
the
possession
of
the
new
style
of
laborer
began
to
call
time
to
get
up
bo
gentlemen
hallo
there

bang
bang
after
a
while
the
new
hands
appeared
outside
and
as
they
looked
around
noticed
that
the
sun
was
looking
larger
and
redder
than
they
remembered
it
and
too
low
down
the
morning
air
was
chilling
and
grass
bushes
everything
dripping
with
dew
the
farmer
led
the
way
to
the
stable
yard
and
pointing
to
a
very
lively
restless
muscular
young
bull
with
handsome
horns
and
glaring
eyes
said
he
was
to
be
yoked
and
hitched
to
the
cart
if
he
had
asked
them
to
bridle
and
saddle
an
untamed
african
lion
they
would
not
have
been
more
unwilling
or
less
competent
so
the
farmer
telling
them
the
animal
was
very
gentle
and
harmless
proceeded
to
yoke
and
hitch
him
hoping
he
said
that
having
once
seen
the
operation
his
new
hands
would
know
how
the
yoke
was
a
sort
of
collar
and
when
the
hitching
was
done
the
bull
stood
in
the
shafts
of
the
cart
just
as
a
horse
would
instead
of
a
bridle
and
reins
a
heavy
iron
chain
with
links
an
inch
and
a
half
long
was
passed
around
the
base
of
the
animal
horns
the
driver
held
the
end
of
the
chain
and
managed
the
animal
by
giving
it
tremendous
jerks
which
never
failed
to
thrill
the
bull
with
agony
if
one
might
judge
from
the
expression
of
his
countenance
and
the
eagerness
with
which
he
rammed
his
horns
into
or
anything
near
whenever
he
felt
the
shock
the
soldiers
constantly
marveled
that
his
horns
did
not
drop
off
but
they
were
not
familiar
with
country
life
and
especially
ignorant
of
the
art
of
driving
an
illustration
bull
team
after
breakfast
the
younger
of
the
two
survivors
was
told
to
take
the
cart
drawn
by
the
animal
already
described
and
go
down
into
the
woods
after
a
load
of
for
the
kitchen
fire
the
trip
the
woods
was
comparatively
easy
the
wood
was
soon
loaded
on
the
cart
and
the
journey
home
commenced
after
going
a
few
yards
the
animal
concluded
to
stop
his
driver
finding
that
coaxing
would
not
induce
him
to
start
slacked
the
chain
gave
it
a
quick
strong
jerk
and
started
him
he
went
off
at
a
fearful
rate
with
his
nose
on
the
ground
and
his
tail
flying
like
a
banner
in
the
air
in
a
moment
he
managed
to
hang
a
sapling
which
halted
him
but
summoning
all
his
strength
for
a
great
effort
he
bent
himself
to
the
yoke
the
sapling
slowly
bent
forward
and
the
axle
mounted
it
in
another
moment
the
sapling
had
righted
itself
but
the
cart
was
turned
over
completely
and
the
wood
on
the
ground
there
were
a
great
many
mosquitoes
gnats
and
flies
in
those
woods
and
they
were
biting
furiously
possibly
that
may
account
for
the
exasperated
condition
of
the
driver
and
his
use
of
strong
expressions
there
the
cart
was
righted
the
wood
piled
on
again
and
strange
to
say
got
out
of
the
woods
without
further
mishap
but
in
order
to
reach
the
house
it
was
necessary
to
drive
up
the
slope
of
a
with
here
and
there
a
stump
on
the
way
up
the
driver
saw
a
stump
ahead
and
determined
to
avoid
it
so
he
gave
the
chain
a
shake
but
the
animal
preferred
to
straddle
the
stump
and
would
have
succeeded
but
for
the
fact
that
it
was
too
high
to
pass
beneath
the
axle
as
soon
as
he
felt
the
resistance
of
the
stump
against
the
axle
he
made
splendid
exertions
to
overcome
it
and
succeeded
in
walking
off
with
the
body
of
the
cart
leaving
the
axle
and
wheels
behind
he
did
go
far
however
the
farmer
came
down
and
released
the
weary
animal
the
survivor
then
toted
the
wood
stick
by
stick
to
the
house
and
learned
thereby
the
value
of
ready
to
hand
people
who
are
raised
in
the
country
have
simple
ways
but
they
can
do
some
things
much
better
than
can
they
are
useful
people
they
are
not
afraid
of
cattle
or
horses
the
next
day
this
awful
animal
was
yoked
to
a
plow
and
placed
under
the
care
of
the
elder
of
the
survivors
who
was
to
plow
a
field
near
the
house
in
a
few
minutes
he
did
something
displeasing
to
the
bull
which
started
him
to
running
at
a
fearful
speed
he
dashed
away
towards
the
house
the
plow
flying
and
flapping
about
like
the
arms
of
a
flail
tore
through
the
ripping
them
to
pieces
tore
down
all
the
choice
young
trees
about
the
house
frightened
the
ladies
and
children
nearly
to
death
and
demoralized
the
whole
farm
he
was
at
last
captured
and
affectionately
cared
for
by
the
farmer
who
no
doubt
felt
that
it
was
a
pity
for
any
man
to
be
compelled
to
trust
his
valuable
stock
to
the
management
of
green
hands
in
the
mean
time
the
other
man
had
been
furnished
with
a
harrow
and
a
mule
and
sent
to
harrow
a
field
the
farmer
pointed
carelessly
no
doubt
to
a
field
and
said
now
you
go
there
and
drag
that
field
you
know
how
do
you
well
so
he
went
and
dragged
that
old
harrow
up
and
down
up
and
down
for
many
a
weary
hour
towards
dinner
time
he
heard
a
voice
in
the
distance
as
of
some
one
in
distress
heigh
say
there
stop
hold
on
there
came
the
farmer
running
panting
gesticulating
and
screaming
standing
in
astonishment
the
agricultural
survivor
awaited
his
arrival
and
an
explanation
of
his
strange
conduct
as
soon
as
the
farmer
had
breath
to
speak
he
said
ah
me
oh
my
mister
my
dear
sir
you
have
gone
sir
and
sir
you
have
tore
up
my
turnip
and
he
wept
there
sorely
you
see
the
farmer
pointed
out
the
field
carelessly
and
the
hand
got
on
the
one
he
noticed
some
vegetation
shooting
up
here
and
there
but
supposed
it
was
some
weed
the
farmer
wished
to
eradicate
do
know
everything
and
soldiers
so
the
three
refugees
before
mentioned
were
an
old
gentleman
his
aged
wife
and
their
widowed
daughter
having
lost
their
home
and
all
their
worldly
possessions
they
had
agreed
to
work
for
the
farmer
for
food
and
lodging
the
old
gentleman
was
acting
somewhat
in
the
character
of
coachman
his
wife
was
nurse
and
the
widowed
daughter
was
cook
and
the
three
were
fully
the
equals
if
not
the
superiors
of
the
family
in
which
they
were
serving
happily
for
them
they
soon
got
some
good
news
and
drove
away
in
their
own
carriage
the
farmer
did
the
best
he
could
for
them
while
they
stayed
and
for
his
survivors
but
he
was
burdened
with
a
large
family
a
miserably
poor
farm
deep
poverty
and
hopeless
shiftlessness
one
day
the
farmer
made
up
his
mind
to
cultivate
a
certain
field
in
the
centre
of
which
he
had
an
extensive
inclosed
by
a
fence
to
prepare
the
way
he
wanted
that
fence
taken
down
carried
rail
by
rail
to
the
corner
of
the
field
and
there
piled
up
he
put
one
of
his
new
hands
to
work
at
this
interesting
job
and
went
home
probably
to
take
a
nap
the
survivor
toted
rails
that
day
on
one
shoulder
until
it
was
bleeding
and
then
on
the
other
until
that
was
too
sensitive
then
he
walked
over
to
see
how
the
other
hand
was
getting
along
with
the
horse
and
mule
team
and
the
harrow
he
found
him
very
warm
very
much
exasperated
using
excited
language
beating
the
animals
and
declaring
that
no
man
under
the
sun
ever
encountered
such
formidable
difficulties
in
the
pursuit
of
agricultural
profit
he
explained
that
the
horse
was
too
large
and
the
mule
too
small
the
traces
were
too
old
and
would
break
every
few
yards
the
harness
was
dropping
to
pieces
the
teeth
constantly
dropping
out
of
the
harrow
and
the
harrow
itself
ready
to
tumble
into
firewood
in
addition
to
these
annoyances
the
mule
and
the
horse
alternated
between
going
the
wrong
way
and
not
going
at
all
the
man
almost
wept
as
he
described
the
aggravating
calmness
of
the
animals
when
a
trace
broke
they
turned
gazed
on
the
wreck
stood
still
groaned
by
way
of
a
sigh
and
seemed
to
say
one
more
brief
respite
thank
providence
fifteen
minutes
to
tie
up
that
old
chain
after
a
careful
survey
of
the
situation
and
some
tolerably
accurate
guesses
as
to
the
proximity
of
the
dinner
hour
the
two
battered
remnants
of
the
glorious
old
army
decided
to
suspend
operations
and
slowly
wended
their
way
to
the
house
one
carrying
his
lacerated
shoulders
and
the
other
steering
the
remains
of
the
harrow
it
had
been
agreed
indeed
the
remnants
had
insisted
that
they
were
to
be
directed
about
their
work
and
made
to
serve
exactly
as
the
negro
hands
would
have
been
had
they
remained
but
so
novel
was
the
situation
the
farmer
had
constantly
to
be
reminded
of
his
authority
at
last
a
bright
idea
occurred
to
the
farmer
he
would
undertake
a
little
work
for
a
neighbor
and
thus
relieve
the
survivors
of
the
monotony
of
the
hoe
the
plow
and
the
harrow
some
old
ladies
wanted
their
household
goods
moved
from
one
house
to
another
and
we
were
to
undertake
the
job
the
entire
force
consisted
of
the
mule
and
the
cart
thereto
belonging
and
the
bull
and
his
cart
the
mule
had
precedence
in
the
line
and
was
closely
followed
by
the
bull
the
farmer
walked
in
front
as
pioneer
the
elder
survivor
drove
the
mule
and
the
hero
of
the
held
the
chain
which
agonized
the
bull
when
necessary
at
the
brow
of
a
certain
long
hill
which
the
humble
mule
had
quietly
walked
down
the
bull
halted
for
meditation
his
impatient
and
less
romantic
driver
thoughtlessly
gave
the
chain
a
rude
jerk
in
an
instant
he
felt
himself
whirled
down
that
hill
at
breakneck
speed
almost
simultaneous
with
the
start
was
the
shock
of
the
stop
picking
himself
up
the
driver
found
his
cart
securely
fastened
to
a
which
was
jammed
between
the
wheel
and
the
body
of
it
the
steed
was
unhurt
but
excited
after
a
long
coaxing
the
farmer
persuaded
him
to
back
far
enough
to
disengage
the
cart
and
the
progress
continued
the
furniture
was
found
in
a
small
room
up
a
crooked
and
narrow
stairs
nothing
was
as
large
as
the
furniture
how
to
get
it
out
was
a
conundrum
one
of
the
survivors
suggested
to
the
farmer
to
knock
off
the
roof
of
the
house
and
take
it
out
that
way
but
he
would
hear
of
it
finally
the
cart
was
driven
under
the
eaves
and
while
those
whose
past
services
had
endeared
them
to
their
countrymen
rolled
the
furniture
out
of
the
window
and
lowered
it
by
hand
from
the
eaves
the
farmer
stowed
it
in
the
cart
the
ladies
though
greatly
agitated
by
the
imminent
danger
of
the
furniture
found
time
to
admire
the
ingenuity
and
originality
of
the
plan
and
the
intrepid
daring
of
its
execution
the
farmer
who
had
several
times
been
in
danger
of
having
himself
mashed
flat
was
entirely
overlooked
both
the
carts
being
loaded
the
train
moved
off
in
good
order
after
a
few
days
the
farmer
mounted
one
of
the
men
not
conquered
but
wearied
with
victory
on
the
mule
gave
him
an
old
and
sent
him
to
a
neighbor
for
meal
and
bacon
he
got
say
a
peck
of
one
and
a
pound
or
two
of
the
other
this
proceeding
was
repeated
at
intervals
of
a
day
or
two
and
finally
led
to
the
conclusion
that
the
farmer
was
living
from
hand
to
mouth
certainly
and
in
all
probability
on
charity
besides
the
new
hands
felt
a
growing
indisposition
owing
to
the
meagre
supplies
on
the
table
to
allow
themselves
any
latitude
in
the
matter
of
eating
so
they
resolved
to
try
the
good
old
plan
of
days
gone
by
and
send
out
a
foraging
party
the
plans
were
discussed
at
length
and
everything
decided
one
morning
early
the
senior
of
the
endeared
survivors
took
the
road
for
richmond
distant
about
fourteen
miles
intending
there
to
lay
in
food
tobacco
pipes
information
and
any
other
little
thing
calculated
to
brighten
life
on
a
farm
during
his
absence
the
other
forlorn
survivor
groaned
with
impatience
and
doubt
questioning
the
possibility
of
a
man
returning
to
such
a
place
after
seeing
the
luxurious
supplies
of
good
eating
on
exhibition
by
the
yankee
sutlers
in
richmond
but
he
did
return
like
a
good
comrade
bringing
his
plunder
with
him
he
made
the
round
trip
of
miles
on
foot
and
at
midnight
reached
the
quarters
with
cold
ham
good
bread
pipes
smoking
tobacco
chewing
tobacco
a
few
clean
clothes
and
a
good
pair
of
shoes
which
one
of
the
party
needed
these
were
the
gift
of
an
old
friend
in
town
sitting
on
the
bedside
as
morning
approached
they
made
a
hearty
meal
and
then
smoked
smoked
smoked
as
only
men
can
smoke
who
love
to
smoke
and
have
not
had
the
wherewithal
for
a
week
or
two
the
returned
forager
told
of
the
strange
sights
he
had
seen
in
town
some
young
confederates
who
were
smart
were
at
work
in
the
ruins
cleaning
bricks
at
five
dollars
a
day
others
had
government
work
as
clerks
mechanics
and
laborers
earning
from
one
to
five
dollars
a
day
the
government
had
established
commissary
stores
at
different
points
in
the
city
where
rations
were
sold
at
nominal
prices
to
those
who
could
buy
and
supplied
gratis
to
those
who
could
not
he
had
seen
old
gentlemen
all
their
lives
used
to
plenty
standing
about
these
places
waiting
their
turn
to
draw
soldiers
marched
by
twos
and
fours
and
by
companies
everywhere
captains
and
lieutenants
sergeants
and
corporals
were
the
masters
of
the
city
and
a
sort
of
temporary
providence
dictating
what
sort
of
clothes
the
people
were
to
wear
what
they
might
eat
what
they
might
do
what
they
might
say
and
think
in
short
allowing
the
people
to
live
as
it
were
on
a
limited
ticket
but
among
other
things
the
forager
brought
information
to
the
effect
that
he
had
secured
employment
for
both
at
the
cheering
rate
of
five
dollars
per
week
so
one
day
these
two
laid
down
the
shovel
and
the
hoe
and
made
most
excellent
time
for
richmond
arriving
there
early
in
the
day
and
entering
at
once
upon
the
new
work
illustration
buttons
off
during
the
stay
at
the
farm
the
survivors
felt
that
they
were
not
yet
returned
to
civil
life
but
foraging
on
the
neutral
ground
between
war
and
peace
neither
soldiers
nor
citizens
but
now
in
regular
employment
in
a
city
own
with
so
much
per
week
and
the
responsibility
of
finding
themselves
and
especially
after
the
provost
made
them
cut
the
brass
buttons
off
their
jackets
and
more
especially
after
they
were
informed
that
they
must
take
the
oath
before
doing
anything
else
they
began
to
think
that
probably
the
war
was
nearing
its
end
but
a
real
good
hearty
war
like
that
dies
hard
no
country
likes
to
part
with
a
good
earnest
war
it
likes
to
talk
about
the
war
write
its
history
fight
its
battles
over
and
over
again
and
build
monument
after
monument
to
commemorate
its
glories
a
long
time
after
a
war
people
begin
to
find
out
as
they
read
that
the
deadly
struggle
marked
a
grand
period
in
their
history
chapter
xi
of
the
boys
in
gray
the
soldier
may
forget
the
long
weary
march
with
its
dust
heat
and
thirst
and
he
may
forget
the
horrors
and
blood
of
the
or
he
may
recall
them
sadly
as
he
thinks
of
the
loved
dead
but
the
cheerful
happy
scenes
of
the
he
will
never
forget
how
willingly
he
closes
his
eyes
to
the
present
to
dream
of
those
happy
careless
days
and
nights
around
the
fire
crystallize
the
memories
of
the
soldier
life
it
was
his
home
his
place
of
rest
where
he
met
with
good
companionship
kindled
the
fire
nobody
had
matches
there
was
no
fire
in
sight
and
yet
scarcely
was
the
camp
determined
when
the
bright
blaze
of
the
was
seen
was
a
shadowy
fellow
who
kindled
the
fire
nobody
knows
who
he
was
but
no
matter
how
wet
the
leaves
how
sobby
the
twigs
no
matter
if
there
was
no
fire
in
a
mile
of
the
camp
that
fellow
could
start
one
some
men
might
get
down
on
hands
and
knees
and
blow
it
and
fan
it
rear
and
charge
and
fume
and
fret
and
yet
she
would
burn
but
this
fellow
would
come
kick
it
all
around
scatter
it
rake
it
together
again
shake
it
up
a
little
and
oh
it
the
little
flames
would
bite
the
twigs
and
snap
at
the
branches
embrace
the
logs
and
leap
and
dance
and
laugh
at
the
touch
of
the
master
hand
and
soon
lay
at
his
feet
a
bed
of
glowing
coals
as
soon
as
the
fire
is
kindled
all
hands
want
water
who
can
find
it
where
is
it
never
mind
we
have
a
man
who
knows
where
to
go
he
says
where
our
bucket
and
then
we
hear
the
rattle
of
the
old
tin
cup
as
it
drops
to
the
bottom
of
it
and
away
he
goes
nobody
knows
where
but
knows
and
he
does
stop
to
think
but
without
the
slightest
hesitation
or
doubt
strikes
out
in
the
darkness
from
the
as
a
centre
draw
radii
and
start
an
ordinary
man
on
any
of
them
and
let
him
walk
a
mile
on
each
and
he
will
miss
the
water
but
that
fellow
in
the
mess
with
the
water
instinct
never
failed
he
would
go
as
straight
for
the
spring
or
well
or
creek
or
river
as
though
he
had
lived
in
that
immediate
neighborhood
all
his
life
and
never
got
water
anywhere
else
what
a
valuable
man
he
was
a
modest
fellow
who
never
knew
his
own
greatness
but
others
remember
and
honor
him
may
he
never
want
for
any
good
thing
having
a
roaring
fire
and
a
bucket
of
good
water
we
settle
down
a
man
can
not
be
comfortable
so
each
man
and
his
chum
picks
out
a
tree
and
that
particular
tree
becomes
the
homestead
of
the
two
they
hang
their
canteens
on
it
lay
their
haversacks
and
spread
their
blankets
at
the
foot
of
it
and
sit
down
and
lean
their
weary
backs
against
it
and
feel
that
they
are
at
home
how
gloomy
the
woods
are
beyond
the
glow
of
our
fire
how
cozy
and
comfortable
we
are
who
stand
around
it
and
inhale
the
aroma
of
the
and
skillet
the
man
squatting
by
the
fire
is
a
person
of
importance
he
talk
not
he
his
whole
mind
is
concentrated
on
that
skillet
he
is
our
cook
volunteer
natural
and
talented
cook
not
in
a
vulgar
sense
he
does
mix
but
simply
bakes
the
biscuit
every
faculty
all
the
energy
of
the
man
is
employed
in
that
great
work
do
suggest
anything
to
him
if
you
value
his
friendship
do
attempt
to
put
on
or
take
off
from
the
top
of
that
skillet
one
single
coal
and
do
be
in
a
hurry
for
the
biscuit
you
need
not
say
you
like
yours
half
done
etc
simply
wait
when
he
thinks
they
are
ready
and
not
before
you
get
them
may
raise
the
lid
cautiously
now
and
then
and
look
in
but
do
look
in
do
say
you
think
they
are
done
because
useless
ah
his
face
relaxes
he
raises
the
lid
turns
it
upside
down
to
throw
off
the
coals
and
says
right
and
now
with
the
air
of
a
wealthy
philanthropist
he
distributes
the
solid
and
weighty
product
of
his
skill
to
as
it
were
the
humble
dependents
around
him
the
general
of
the
mess
having
satisfied
the
cravings
of
the
inner
man
now
proceeds
to
enlighten
the
ordinary
members
of
it
as
to
when
how
and
why
and
where
the
campaign
will
open
and
what
will
be
the
result
he
arranges
for
every
possible
and
impossible
contingency
and
brings
the
war
to
a
favorable
and
early
termination
the
greatest
mistake
general
lee
ever
made
was
that
he
failed
to
consult
this
man
who
can
tell
what
might
have
been
if
he
had
now
to
the
consternation
of
all
hands
our
old
friend
the
bore
familiarly
known
as
the
old
auger
opens
his
mouth
to
tell
us
of
a
little
incident
illustrative
of
his
personal
prowess
and
by
way
of
preface
commences
at
eden
and
goes
laboriously
through
the
patriarchal
age
on
through
the
mosaic
dispensation
to
the
christian
era
takes
in
grecian
and
roman
history
by
the
way
then
spain
and
germany
and
england
and
colonial
times
and
the
early
history
of
our
grand
republic
the
causes
of
and
necessity
for
our
war
and
a
complete
history
up
to
date
and
then
slowly
unfolds
the
little
matter
we
always
loved
to
hear
this
man
and
prided
ourselves
on
being
the
only
mess
in
the
army
having
such
treasure
our
the
auger
having
been
detailed
for
walks
off
his
voice
grows
fainter
and
fainter
in
the
distance
and
we
call
forth
our
poet
one
eye
is
bandaged
with
a
dirty
cotton
rag
he
is
bareheaded
and
his
hair
resembles
a
dismantled
straw
stack
his
elbows
and
knees
are
out
and
his
pants
from
the
knee
down
have
a
tinge
imparted
by
the
genial
heat
of
many
a
fire
his
toes
protrude
themselves
prominently
from
his
shoes
you
would
say
what
a
dirty
ignorant
fellow
but
listen
to
his
rich
voice
how
perfect
his
memory
what
graceful
gestures
how
his
single
eye
glows
see
the
color
on
his
cheek
see
the
strained
and
still
attention
of
the
little
group
around
him
as
he
steps
into
the
light
of
the
fire
hear
him
i
am
dying
egypt
dying
ebbs
the
crimson
fast
and
the
dark
plutonian
shadows
gather
on
the
evening
blast
let
thine
arms
o
queen
support
me
hush
thy
sobs
and
bow
thine
ear
listen
to
the
great
heart
secrets
thou
and
thou
alone
must
hear
i
am
dying
egypt
dying
hark
the
insulting
foeman
cry
they
are
coming
quick
my
falchion
let
me
front
them
ere
i
die
ah
no
more
amid
the
battle
shall
my
heart
exulting
swell

farewell
illustration
the
poet
of
our
mess
good
bully
go
ahead
jack
give
us
some
more
old
fellow
and
he
generally
did
much
to
everybody
satisfaction
we
all
loved
jack
of
our
mess
he
sleeps
his
battles
in
hollywood
the
man
generally
put
in
towards
the
last
and
sung
us
to
bed
he
was
generally
a
diminutive
man
with
a
sweet
voice
and
a
sweetheart
at
home
his
songs
had
in
them
rosy
lips
blue
eyes
golden
hair
pearly
teeth
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
of
course
he
would
sing
some
good
rollicking
songs
in
order
to
give
all
a
chance
and
so
with
hearty
chorus
three
times
around
went
she
virginia
virginia
the
land
of
the
free
no
surrender
lula

variations
dixie
the

farewell

hail
columbia
with
immense
variations
and
maryland
my
maryland
till
about
the
third
year
of
the
war
when
we
began
to
think
maryland
had
breathed
and
burned
long
enough
and
ought
to
come
what
part
of
her
did
come
was
how
the
woods
did
ring
with
song
there
were
patriotic
songs
romantic
and
love
songs
sarcastic
comic
and
war
songs
pirates
glees
plantation
melodies
lullabies
good
old
hymn
tunes
anthems
songs
and
everything
but
vulgar
and
obscene
songs
these
were
scarcely
ever
heard
and
were
nowhere
in
the
army
well
received
or
encouraged
the
recruit
our
latest
acquisition
was
interesting
his
nice
clean
clothes
new
hat
new
shoes
trimming
on
his
shirt
front
letters
and
on
his
hat
new
knife
for
all
the
fellows
to
borrow
nice
comb
for
general
use
nice
little
glass
to
shave
by
good
smoking
tobacco
money
in
his
pocket
to
lend
out
oh
what
a
great
convenience
he
was
how
things
he
had
that
a
fellow
could
borrow
and
how
willing
he
was
to
go
on
guard
and
get
wet
and
give
away
his
rations
and
bring
water
and
cut
wood
and
ride
horses
to
water
and
he
was
so
clean
and
sweet
and
his
cheeks
so
rosy
all
the
fellows
wanted
to
bunk
with
him
under
his
nice
new
blanket
and
impart
to
him
some
of
their
numerous
and
energetic
tormentors
and
then
it
was
so
to
hear
him
talk
he
knew
about
war
arms
tents
knapsacks
ammunition
marching
fighting
camping
cooking
shooting
and
everything
a
soldier
is
and
does
it
is
remarkable
how
much
a
recruit
and
how
little
an
old
soldier
knows
about
such
things
after
a
while
the
recruit
forgets
all
and
is
as
ignorant
as
any
veteran
how
good
the
fellows
were
to
a
really
gentlemanly
boy
how
they
loved
him
the
was
a
wonderful
fellow
and
very
useful
he
could
write
a
pass
sign
the
captain
name
better
than
the
captain
himself
and
endorse
it
respectfully
forwarded
approved
sign
the
colonel
name
after
respectfully
forwarded
approved
and
then
on
up
to
the
commanding
officer
and
do
it
so
well
nobody
wanted
anything
better
the
boys
had
great
veneration
for
the
scribe
and
used
him
constantly
the
man
was
very
useful
he
made
fun
he
knew
how
to
volunteer
to
shave
a
fellow
with
a
big
beard
and
moustache
he
lend
his
razor
but
he
shave
him
very
well
he
shaves
one
cheek
one
half
the
chin
one
side
of
the
upper
lip
puts
his
razor
in
his
pocket
walks
off
and
leaves
his
customer
the
most
chap
in
the
army
he
knew
how
to
do
something
like
this
what
a
treasure
to
a
mess
the
was
a
good
fellow
he
always
divided
with
the
mess
if
there
was
buttermilk
anywhere
inside
of
ten
miles
he
found
it
apples
he
could
smell
from
afar
off
if
anybody
was
killing
pork
in
the
county
he
got
the
if
a
man
had
a
cider
cart
on
the
road
he
saw
him
first
and
bought
him
out
no
had
a
keener
scent
no
eagle
a
sharper
eye
how
indefatigable
he
was
distance
rivers
mountains
pickets
patrols
nothing
could
stop
or
hinder
him
he
never
bragged
about
his
exploits
simply
brought
in
the
spoils
laid
them
down
and
said
pitch
in
not
a
word
of
the
weary
miles
he
had
traveled
how
he
begged
or
how
much
he
paid
simply
pitch
in
illustration
the
man
he
happened
to
be
in
our
mess
never
had
any
sugar
over
any
salt
any
soda
any
coffee
oh
no
but
beg
him
plead
with
him
bear
with
him
when
he
says
go
way
boy
am
i
the
have
i
got
all
the
sugar
in
the
confederacy
you
know
rations
are
short
now
then
see
him
relax
come
here
my
son
untie
that
bag
there
and
look
in
that
old
jacket
and
you
will
find
another
bag
a
little
bag
and
look
in
there
and
you
will
find
some
sugar
now
go
round
and
tell
everybody
in
camp
wo
you
tell
all
to
come
and
get
some
sugar
i
know
you
wo
oh
yes
of
course
as
a
general
rule
every
mess
had
a
bully
and
an
argument
man
time
would
fail
me
to
tell
of
the
lazy
man
the
brave
man
the
worthless
man
the
ingenious
man
the
helpless
man
the
sensitive
man
and
the
gentleman
but
they
are
as
familiar
to
the
members
of
the
mess
as
the
honest
man
who
would
not
eat
stolen
pig
but
would
take
a
little
of
the
gravy
every
soldier
remembers
indeed
was
personally
acquainted
with
the
man
how
he
denied
vehemently
his
own
identity
and
talked
about
poison
oak
and
heat
and
itch
and
all
those
things
and
strove
in
the
presence
of
those
who
knew
how
it
was
themselves
to
prove
his
absolute
freedom
from
anything
like
universality
poor
fellow
sulphur
internally
and
externally
would
not
do
alas
his
only
hope
was
to
acknowledge
his
unhappy
state
and
stand
in
the
presence
of
his
peers
confessed
the
boys
in
blue
generally
preferred
to
camp
in
the
open
fields
the
confeds
took
to
the
woods
and
so
the
confederate
camp
was
not
as
orderly
or
as
systematically
arranged
but
the
most
picturesque
of
the
two
the
blazing
fire
lit
up
the
forms
and
faces
and
trees
around
it
with
a
ruddy
glow
but
only
deepened
the
gloom
of
the
surrounding
woods
so
that
the
soldier
pitied
the
poor
fellows
away
off
on
guard
in
the
darkness
and
hugging
himself
felt
how
good
it
was
to
be
with
the
fellows
around
the
fire
how
companionable
was
the
blaze
and
the
glow
of
the
coals
they
warmed
the
heart
as
well
as
the
foot
the
imagination
seemed
to
feed
on
the
glowing
coals
and
surrounding
gloom
and
when
the
soldier
gazed
on
the
fire
peace
liberty
home
strolls
in
the
woods
and
streets
with
friends
the
church
the
school
playmates
and
sweethearts
all
passed
before
him
and
even
the
dead
came
to
mind
sadly
yet
pleasantly
he
thought
of
the
loved
and
lost
the
future
loomed
up
and
the
possibility
of
death
and
prison
and
the
grief
at
home
would
stir
his
heart
and
the
tears
would
fall
trickling
to
the
ground
then
was
the
time
to
fondle
the
little
gifts
from
home
simple
things
the
little
the
with
thread
and
buttons
the
embroidered
tobacco
bag
and
the
knitted
gloves
then
the
time
to
gaze
on
photographs
and
to
read
and
the
letter
telling
of
the
struggles
at
home
and
the
coming
box
of
good
things
butter
and
bread
toasted
and
ground
coffee
sugar
cakes
and
pies
and
other
comfortable
things
prepared
by
for
the
soldier
brother
and
son
then
the
time
to
call
on
god
to
spare
protect
and
bless
the
dear
defenseless
helpless
ones
at
home
then
the
time
for
high
resolves
to
read
to
himself
his
duty
to
for
the
war
then
his
heart
grew
to
his
comrades
his
general
and
his
country
and
as
the
trees
swept
by
the
wintry
winds
moaned
around
him
the
soldier
slept
and
dreamed
and
dreamed
of
home
sweet
home
those
whose
knowledge
of
war
and
its
effects
on
the
character
of
the
soldier
was
gleaned
from
the
history
of
the
wars
of
europe
and
of
ancient
times
greatly
dreaded
the
demoralization
which
they
supposed
would
result
from
the
confederate
war
for
independence
and
their
solicitude
was
directed
mainly
towards
the
young
men
of
virginia
and
the
south
who
were
to
compose
the
armies
of
the
confederate
states
it
was
feared
by
many
that
the
bivouac
the
and
the
march
would
accustom
the
ears
of
their
bright
and
innocent
boys
to
obscenity
oaths
and
blasphemy
and
forever
destroy
that
purity
of
mind
and
soul
which
was
their
priceless
possession
when
they
bid
farewell
to
home
and
mother
some
feared
the
destruction
of
the
the
wiser
feared
hardship
and
disease
and
others
more
than
all
the
destruction
of
morals
and
everything
good
and
pure
in
character
that
the
fears
of
the
last
named
were
realized
in
some
cases
can
not
be
denied
but
that
the
general
result
was
demoralization
can
be
denied
and
the
contrary
demonstrated
let
us
consider
the
effect
of
upon
a
pure
and
noble
boy
and
to
make
the
picture
complete
let
us
go
to
his
home
and
witness
the
parting
the
boy
is
clothed
as
a
soldier
his
pockets
and
his
haversack
are
stored
with
little
conveniences
made
by
the
loving
hands
of
mother
sister
and
sweetheart
and
the
sad
yet
proud
hour
has
arrived
sisters
smiling
through
their
tears
filled
with
commingled
pride
and
sorrow
kiss
and
embrace
their
great
hero
the
mother
with
calm
heroism
suppressing
her
tender
maternal
grief
impresses
upon
his
lips
a
fervent
kiss
presses
him
to
her
heart
and
resigns
him
to
god
his
country
and
his
honor
the
father
last
to
part
presses
his
hand
gazes
with
ineffable
love
into
his
bright
eyes
and
fearing
to
trust
his
feelings
for
a
more
lengthy
farewell
says
my
boy
god
bless
you
be
a
man
let
those
scoff
who
will
but
let
them
know
that
such
a
parting
is
itself
a
new
and
wonderful
power
a
purifying
and
elevating
power
worth
the
danger
toil
and
suffering
of
the
soldier
the
sister
tears
the
father
words
the
mother
kiss
planted
in
the
memory
of
that
boy
will
surely
bring
forth
fruit
beautiful
as
a
mother
love
as
he
journeys
to
the
camp
how
dear
do
all
at
home
become
oh
what
holy
tears
he
sheds
his
heart
how
tender
then
as
he
nears
the
line
and
sees
for
the
first
time
the
realities
of
war
the
passing
sick
and
weary
and
the
wounded
and
bloody
dead
his
soldier
spirit
is
born
he
smiles
his
chest
expands
his
eyes
brighten
his
heart
swells
with
pride
he
hurries
on
and
soon
stands
in
the
magic
circle
around
the
glowing
fire
the
admired
and
loved
pet
of
a
dozen
true
hearts
is
he
happy
aye
never
before
has
he
felt
such
glorious
swelling
panting
joy
he
a
soldier
now
he
is
put
on
guard
no
longer
the
object
of
care
and
solicitude
he
stands
in
the
solitude
of
the
night
himself
a
guardian
of
those
who
sleep
courage
is
his
now
he
feels
he
is
trusted
as
a
man
and
is
ready
at
once
nobly
to
perish
in
the
defense
of
his
comrades
he
marches
dare
he
murmur
or
complain
no
the
eyes
of
all
are
upon
him
and
endurance
grows
silently
till
pain
and
weariness
are
familiar
and
cheerfully
borne
at
home
he
would
be
pitied
and
petted
but
now
he
must
endure
or
have
the
contempt
of
the
strong
spirits
around
him
he
is
hungry
so
are
others
and
he
must
not
only
bear
the
privation
but
he
must
divide
his
pitiful
meal
when
he
gets
it
with
his
comrades
and
so
generosity
strikes
down
selfishness
in
a
thousand
ways
he
is
tried
and
that
by
sharp
critics
his
smallest
faults
are
necessarily
apparent
for
in
the
varying
conditions
of
the
soldier
every
quality
is
put
to
the
test
if
he
shows
the
least
cowardice
he
is
undone
his
courage
must
never
fail
he
must
be
manly
and
independent
or
he
will
be
told
he
a
baby
ridiculed
teased
and
despised
when
war
assumes
her
serious
dress
he
sees
the
helplessness
of
women
and
children
he
hears
their
piteous
appeals
and
chivalry
burns
him
till
he
does
his
utmost
of
sacrifice
and
effort
to
protect
and
comfort
and
cheer
them
it
is
a
mistake
to
suppose
that
the
older
men
in
the
army
encouraged
vulgarity
and
obscenity
in
the
young
recruit
for
even
those
who
themselves
indulged
in
these
would
frown
on
the
first
show
of
them
in
a
boy
and
without
hesitation
put
him
down
mercilessly
no
parent
could
watch
a
boy
as
closely
as
his
did
and
could
because
they
saw
him
at
all
hours
of
the
day
and
night
dependent
on
himself
alone
and
were
merciless
critics
who
demanded
more
of
their
than
they
were
willing
to
submit
to
themselves
the
young
soldier
piety
had
to
perish
ignominiously
or
else
assume
a
boldness
and
strength
which
nothing
else
could
so
well
impart
as
the
temptations
sneers
and
dangers
of
the
army
religion
had
to
be
bold
practical
and
courageous
or
die
in
the
army
the
young
man
learned
to
value
men
for
what
they
were
and
not
on
account
of
education
wealth
or
station
and
so
his
attachments
when
formed
were
sincere
and
durable
and
he
learned
what
constitutes
a
man
and
a
desirable
and
reliable
friend
the
stern
demands
upon
the
boy
and
the
unrelenting
criticisms
of
the
mess
soon
bring
to
mind
the
gentle
forbearance
kind
remonstrance
and
loving
counsels
of
parents
and
homefolks
and
while
he
thinks
he
weeps
and
loves
and
reverences
and
yearns
after
the
things
against
which
he
once
strove
and
under
which
he
chafed
and
complained
home
father
mother
sister
oh
how
far
away
oh
how
dear
himself
how
contemptible
ever
to
have
felt
cold
and
indifferent
to
such
love
then
how
vividly
he
recalls
the
warm
pressure
of
his
mother
lips
on
the
forehead
of
her
boy
how
he
loves
his
mother
see
him
as
he
fills
his
pipe
from
the
bag
there
is
his
name
embroidered
carefully
beautifully
by
his
hand
does
he
forget
her
does
he
not
now
love
her
more
sincerely
and
truly
and
tenderly
than
ever
could
he
love
her
quite
as
much
had
he
never
parted
never
longed
to
see
her
and
could
not
never
been
uncertain
if
she
was
safe
never
felt
she
might
be
homeless
helpless
insulted
a
refugee
from
home
can
he
ever
now
look
on
a
little
girl
and
not
treat
her
kindly
gently
and
lovingly
remembering
his
sister
a
boy
having
ordinary
natural
goodness
and
the
home
supports
described
and
the
constant
watching
of
men
ready
to
criticise
could
but
improve
the
least
exhibition
of
selfishness
cowardice
vulgarity
dishonesty
or
meanness
of
any
kind
brought
down
the
dislike
of
every
man
upon
him
and
persistence
in
disreputable
practice
or
habitual
laziness
and
worthlessness
resulted
in
complete
ostracism
loneliness
and
misery
while
on
the
other
hand
he
might
by
good
behavior
and
genuine
generosity
and
courage
secure
unbounded
love
and
sincere
respect
from
all
visits
home
after
prolonged
absence
and
danger
open
to
the
young
soldier
new
treasures
new
because
though
possessed
always
never
before
felt
and
realized
the
affection
once
seen
only
in
attention
as
he
reaches
home
breaks
out
in
unrestrained
vehemence
the
warm
embrace
of
the
hitherto
dignified
father
the
ecstatic
pleasure
beaming
in
the
mother
eye
the
proud
welcome
of
the
sister
and
the
wild
enthusiasm
even
of
the
old
black
mammy
crowd
on
him
the
knowledge
of
their
love
and
make
him
braver
and
stronger
and
nobler
he
a
hero
from
that
hour
death
for
these
how
easy
the
dangers
of
the
and
the
demands
upon
his
energy
strength
and
courage
not
only
strengthen
the
old
but
almost
create
new
faculties
of
mind
and
heart
the
death
sudden
and
terrible
of
those
dear
to
him
the
imperative
necessity
of
standing
to
his
duty
while
the
wounded
cry
and
groan
and
while
his
heart
yearns
after
them
to
help
them
the
terrible
thirst
hunger
heat
and
weariness
all
these
teach
a
boy
attachment
to
duty
the
value
of
peace
and
safety
and
instead
of
hardening
him
as
some
suppose
they
do
make
him
pity
and
love
even
the
enemy
of
his
country
who
bleeds
and
dies
for
country
the
acquirement
of
subordination
is
a
useful
one
and
that
the
soldier
perforce
has
and
that
not
in
an
abject
cringing
way
but
as
realizing
the
necessity
of
it
and
seeing
the
result
of
it
in
the
good
order
and
consequent
effectiveness
and
success
of
the
army
as
a
whole
but
more
particularly
of
his
own
company
and
detachment
and
if
the
soldier
rises
to
office
the
responsibility
of
command
attention
to
detail
and
minuti√¶
the
critical
eyes
of
his
subordinates
and
the
demands
of
his
superiors
all
withdraw
him
from
the
enticements
of
vice
and
mould
him
into
a
solid
substantial
character
both
capable
and
willing
to
meet
and
overcome
difficulties
the
effect
of
life
on
the
physical
constitution
is
undoubtedly
good
and
as
the
physical
improves
the
mental
is
improved
and
as
the
mind
is
enlightened
the
spirit
is
ennobled
who
can
calculate
the
benefit
derived
from
the
contemplation
of
the
beautiful
in
nature
as
the
soldier
sees
mountains
and
valleys
dreary
wastes
and
verdant
fields
rivers
sequestered
homes
quiet
sleepy
villages
as
they
lay
in
the
morning
light
doomed
to
the
flames
at
evening
scenes
which
alternately
stir
and
calm
his
mind
and
store
it
with
a
panorama
whose
pictures
he
may
pass
before
him
year
after
year
with
quiet
pleasure
war
is
horrible
but
still
it
is
in
a
sense
a
privilege
to
have
lived
in
time
of
war
the
emotions
are
never
so
stirred
as
then
imagination
takes
her
highest
flights
poetry
blazes
song
stirs
the
soul
and
every
noble
attribute
is
brought
into
full
play
it
does
seem
that
the
production
of
one
lee
and
one
jackson
is
worth
much
blood
and
treasure
and
the
building
of
a
noble
character
all
the
toil
and
sacrifice
of
war
the
of
the
army
of
northern
virginia
were
not
places
of
revelry
and
debauchery
they
often
exhibited
scenes
of
love
and
humanity
and
the
purest
sentiments
and
gentlest
feelings
of
man
were
there
admired
and
loved
while
vice
and
debauch
in
any
from
highest
to
lowest
were
condemned
and
punished
more
severely
than
they
are
among
those
who
stay
at
home
and
shirk
the
dangers
and
toils
of
the
soldier
life
indeed
the
demoralizing
effects
of
the
late
war
were
far
more
visible
at
home
among
the
skulks
and
and
suddenly
diseased
than
in
the
army
and
the
demoralized
men
of
are
not
those
who
served
in
the
army
the
defaulters
the
renegades
the
bummers
and
cheats
are
the
boys
who
enjoyed
fat
places
and
salaries
and
easy
comfort
while
the
solid
respected
and
reliable
men
of
the
community
are
those
who
did
their
duty
as
soldiers
and
having
learned
to
suffer
in
war
have
preferred
to
labor
and
suffer
and
earn
rather
than
steal
in
peace
and
strange
to
say
it
is
not
those
who
suffered
most
and
lost
most
fought
and
bled
saw
friend
after
friend
fall
wept
the
dead
and
buried
their
hopes
who
are
now
bitter
and
dissatisfied
quarrelsome
and
fretful
growling
and
complaining
no
they
are
the
peaceful
submissive
of
the
country
ready
to
join
hands
with
all
good
men
in
every
good
work
and
prove
themselves
as
brave
and
good
in
peace
as
they
were
stubborn
and
unconquerable
in
war
many
a
weak
puny
boy

to
his

blasphemous

to

and

those
who
gave

expecting
to
receive
them
again
men
learned
that
life
was
passable
and
enjoyable
without
a
roof
or
even
a
tent
to
shelter
from
the
storm
that
cheerfulness
was
compatible
with
cold
and
hunger
and
that
a
man
without
money
food
or
shelter
need
not
feel
utterly
hopeless
but
might
by
employing
his
wits
find
something
to
eat
where
he
never
found
it
before
and
feel
that
like
a
terrapin
he
might
make
himself
at
home
wherever
he
might
be
men
did
actually
become
as
independent
of
the
imaginary
necessities
as
the
very
wild
beasts
and
can
a
man
learn
all
this
and
not
know
better
than
another
how
to
economize
what
he
has
and
how
to
appreciate
the
numberless
superfluities
of
life
is
he
not
made
by
the
knowledge
he
has
of
how
little
he
really
needs
more
independent
and
less
liable
to
dishonest
exertions
to
procure
a
competency
if
there
were
any
true
men
in

south
any
brave

were

if
there
are
good
and
true
men
in
the
south
now
they
would
go
into
the
army
for
similar
cause
and
to
prove
that
the
army
demoralized
you
must
prove
that
the
men
who
came
out
of
it
are
the
worst
in
the
country

will
try
it
strange
as
it
may
seem
religion
flourished
in

great

thousands
embraced
the
gospel
and
died
triumphing
over

instead
of
the
degradation
so
dreaded

the
strange
ennobling
and
purifying
which
made
men
despise
all
the

for
which
they
ordinarily
strive

in
the
sternest

stern

the

this
banner
the
witness
and
inspiration
of
many
victories
which
was
proudly
borne
on
every
field
from
manassas
to
appomattox
was
conceived
on
the
field
of
battle
lived
on
the
field
of
battle
and
on
the
last
fatal
field
ceased
to
have
place

in
the

but
the
men
who
followed
it
and
the
world
which
watched
its
proud
advance

stand
see
in
it
still
the
unstained
banner
of
a
brave
and
generous
people
whose
deeds
have
outlived
their
country
and
whose
final
defeat
but
added
lustre
to
their
grandest
victories
it
was
not
the

but
simply
the
banner
the
of
the
confederate

as
such
it
should
not

the
condemnation
which
our

gallantry
of

who
followed
where
this
banner
led
it
was
at
the
battle
of
manassas
about
four
of
the
afternoon
of
the
of
july
when
the
fate
of
the
confederacy
seemed
trembling
in
the
balance
that
general
beauregard
looking
across
the
warrenton
turnpike
which
passed
through
the
valley
between
the
position
of
the
confederates
and
the
elevations
beyond
occupied
by
the
federal
line
saw
a
body
of
troops
moving
towards
his
left
and
the
federal
right
he
was
greatly
concerned
to
know
but
could
not
decide
what
troops
they
were
whether
federal
or
confederate
the
similarity
of
uniform
and
of
the
colors
carried
by
the
opposing
armies
and
the
clouds
of
dust
made
it
almost
impossible
to
decide
shortly
before
this
time
general
beauregard
had
received
from
the
signal
officer
captain
alexander
a
dispatch
saying
that
from
the
signal
station
in
the
rear
he
had
sighted
the
colors
of
this
column
drooping
and
covered
with
the
dust
of
journeyings
but
could
not
tell
whether
they
were
the
stars
and
stripes
or
the
stars
and
bars
he
thought
however
that
they
were
probably
patterson
troops
arriving
on
the
field
and
re√´nforcing
the
enemy
general
beauregard
was
momentarily
expecting
help
from
the
right
and
the
uncertainty
and
anxiety
of
this
hour
amounted
to
anguish
still
the
column
pressed
on
calling
a
staff
officer
general
beauregard
instructed
him
to
go
at
once
to
general
johnston
at
the
lewis
house
and
say
that
the
enemy
were
receiving
heavy
re√´nforcements
that
the
troops
on
the
plateau
were
very
much
scattered
and
that
he
would
be
compelled
to
retire
to
the
lewis
house
and
there
hoping
that
the
troops
ordered
up
from
the
right
would
arrive
in
time
to
enable
him
to
establish
and
hold
the
new
line
illustration
here
are
the
colors
meanwhile
the
unknown
troops
were
pressing
on
the
day
was
sultry
and
only
at
long
intervals
was
there
the
slightest
breeze
the
colors
of
the
mysterious
column
hung
drooping
on
the
staff
general
beauregard
tried
again
and
again
to
decide
what
colors
they
carried
he
used
his
glass
repeatedly
and
handing
it
to
others
begged
them
to
look
hoping
that
their
eyes
might
be
keener
than
his
general
beauregard
was
in
a
state
of
great
anxiety
but
finally
determined
to
hold
his
ground
relying
on
the
promised
help
from
the
right
knowing
that
if
it
arrived
in
time
victory
might
be
secured
but
feeling
also
that
if
the
mysterious
column
should
be
federal
troops
the
day
was
lost
suddenly
a
puff
of
wind
spread
the
colors
to
the
breeze
it
was
the
confederate
flag
the
stars
and
bars
it
was
early
with
the
virginia
the
seventh
louisiana
and
the
thirteenth
mississippi
the
column
had
by
this
time
reached
the
extreme
right
of
the
federal
lines
the
moment
the
flag
was
recognized
beauregard
turned
to
his
staff
right
and
left
saying
see
that
the
day
is
ours
and
ordered
an
immediate
advance
in
the
mean
time
early
brigade
deployed
into
line
and
charged
the
enemy
right
elzey
also
dashed
upon
the
field
and
in
one
hour
not
an
enemy
was
to
be
seen
south
of
bull
run
while
on
this
field
and
suffering
this
terrible
anxiety
general
beauregard
determined
that
the
confederate
soldier
must
have
a
flag
so
distinct
from
that
of
the
enemy
that
no
doubt
should
ever
again
endanger
his
cause
on
the
field
of
battle
soon
after
the
battle
he
entered
into
correspondence
with
colonel
william
porcher
miles
who
had
served
on
his
staff
during
the
day
with
a
view
to
securing
his
aid
in
the
matter
and
proposing
a
blue
field
red
bars
crossed
and
gold
stars
they
discussed
the
matter
at
length
colonel
miles
thought
it
was
contrary
to
the
law
of
heraldry
that
the
ground
should
be
blue
the
bars
red
and
the
stars
gold
he
proposed
that
the
ground
should
be
red
the
bars
blue
and
the
stars
white
general
beauregard
approved
the
change
and
discussed
the
matter
freely
with
general
johnston
meanwhile
it
became
known
that
designs
for
a
flag
were
under
discussion
and
many
were
sent
in
one
came
from
mississippi
one
from
walton
and
hancock
which
coincided
with
the
design
of
colonel
miles
the
matter
was
freely
discussed
at
headquarters
till
finally
when
he
arrived
at
fairfax
court
house
general
beauregard
caused
his
draughtsman
a
german
to
make
drawings
of
all
the
various
designs
which
had
been
submitted
with
these
designs
before
them
the
officers
at
headquarters
agreed
on
the
famous
old
banner
the
red
field
the
blue
cross
and
the
white
stars
the
flag
was
then
submitted
to
the
war
department
and
was
approved
the
first
flags
sent
to
the
army
were
presented
to
the
troops
by
general
beauregard
in
person
he
then
expressing
the
hope
and
confidence
that
they
would
become
the
emblem
of
honor
and
of
victory
the
first
three
flags
received
were
made
from
by
the
misses
carey
of
baltimore
and
alexandria
at
their
residences
and
the
residences
of
friends
as
soon
as
they
could
get
a
description
of
the
design
adopted
one
of
the
misses
carey
sent
the
flag
she
made
to
general
beauregard
her
sister
presented
hers
to
general
van
dorn
who
was
then
at
fairfax
court
house
miss
constance
carey
of
alexandria
sent
hers
to
general
joseph
johnston
general
beauregard
sent
the
flag
he
received
at
once
to
new
orleans
for
safe
keeping
after
the
fall
of
new
orleans
beauregard
sent
the
flag
by
a
spanish
then
lying
in
the
river
opposite
new
orleans
to
cuba
where
it
remained
till
the
close
of
the
war
when
it
was
returned
to
general
beauregard
who
presented
it
for
safe
keeping
to
the
washington
artillery
of
new
orleans
this
much
about
the
to
accomplish
if
possible
two
things
first
preserve
the
little
history
connected
with
the
origin
of
the
flag
and
second
place
the
flag
in
a
place
of
security
as
it
were
separated
from
all
the
political
significance
which
attaches
to
the
flag
and
depending
for
its
future
place
solely
upon
the
deeds
of
the
armies
which
bore
it
amid
hardships
untold
to
many
victories
