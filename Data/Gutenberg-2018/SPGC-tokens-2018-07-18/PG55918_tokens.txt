been
filled

at

my

faithfully
as

on

passing
rapidly
through
london
with
its
roar
of
causes
that
have
been
won

the
suburbs
where
they
have
no
causes
and
skirting

nuneham
woods
made
one
great
shadow
on
the
land
one
great
shadow
on
the
thames
according
to
an
old
custom
it
rained
but
rain
takes
away
nothing
from
oxford
save
a
few
nice
foot
passengers
it
transmutes
the
franciscan
habit
of
the
city
to
a
more
dominican
cast
and
if
the
foil
of
sky
be
faintly
lighted
the
rain
becomes
a
visible
beatitude
one
by
one
the
churches
of
mary

pleasant

and
that
old
bucolic
tower
of
robert
d
oigli
s
castle
on
the
west
for
a
minute
several
haystacks
a
gasometer
and
the
engine
smoke
replace
them
but
already
that
one
cameo
from
february
s
hand
has
painted
and
lit
and
garnished
again
that
city
within
the
heart
which
is
oxford
i
think
when
i
see
an
old
woodcut
of
a
patron
holding
his
towered
foundation
in
his
hand
about
to
bestow
it
as
a
gift
as
william
of
wykeham
is
depicted
holding
winchester
that
even
so
oxford
gives
to
us
the
stones
of
church
and
college
the
lawns
and
shrubs
of
gardens
and
the
waters
of
isis
to
be
stored
in
the
chambers
of
the
soul
mother
of
arts
mother
of
arts
and
eloquence
native
to
famous
wits
or
hospitable
in
her
sweet
recess
city
or
suburban
studious
walks
and
shades
so
ran
my
thoughts
and
milton
s
verse
and
possessed
as
it
is
easy
to
become
in
such
a
place
with
its
great
beauty
thinking
of
its
great
renown
my
mind
went
naturally
on
in
the
channel
of
that
same
stream
of
verse
while
i
saw
the
christ
church
groves
the
hinksey
hills
and
the
grey
isis
see
there
the
olive
grove
of
academe
plato
s
retirement
where
the
attic
bird
trills
her
notes
the
summer
long
there
flowery
hill
hymettus
with
the
sound
of
bees
industrious
murmur
oft
invites
to
studious
musing
there
ilissus
rolls
his
whispering
stream
but
the
dark
entry
to
the
city
on
the
western
side
suddenly
changed
my
thoughts
it
is
well
known
it
is
the
most
contemptible
in
europe
it
consists
of
a
hoarding
a
brewery
and
suitable
appurtenances
of
more
recent
date
is
the
magnificent
marmalade
shop
the
most
conspicuous
building
in
oxford
on
the
north
and
east
the
approach
is
not
worse
consisting
as
it
does
of
sermons
in
brick
arranged
in
perfectly
successful
imitation
of
tooting
on
the
south
the
fields
are
melancholy
in
apprehension
of
a
similar
fate
in
short
one
ignorant
of
the
city
might
believe
that
he
was
approaching
the
hub
of
the
universe
then
the
norman
tower
appeared
again
and
the
afforested
castle
mound
rose
up
a
bell
and
many
bells
began
to
sound
the
present
vanished
in
charge
of
a
motor
car
containing
three
gentlemen
with
cigars
and
a
lady
and
the
past
softer
than
the
cooing
of
doves
and
more
compelling
than
organ
music
came
with
the
twilight
from
the
tower
of
michael
s
church
at
sunset
or
at
dawn
the
city
s
place
in
the
world
as
a
beautiful
thing
is
clearest
few
cities
look
other
than
sad
at
those
hours
many
unless
hid
in
their
own
smoke
look
cheap
oxford
becomes
part
of
the
magic
of
sunset
and
dawn
is
as
it
were
gathered
into
the
bosom
of
the
power
that
is
abroad
yet
if
it
is
one
with
the
hills
and
the
clouds
and
the
silence
the
human
dignity
of
the
place
is
also
significant
the
work
of
the
ancient
architect
conspires
with
that
of
the
sunset
and
of
long
pregnant
tracts
of
time
and
i
know
not
whether
to
thank
for
the
beauty
of
the
place
its
genius
or
perhaps
the
divinest
series
of
accidents
that
have
ever
agreed
to
foster
the
designs
of
men
in
the
days
when
what
is
admirable
in
oxford
was
built
the
builder
made
no
pretence
to
please
his
neighbour
he
made
what
he
loved
in
many
cases
he
was
probably
indifferent
to
everything
else
but
the
genius
of
the
place
took
care
and
only
the
recent
architects
who
have
endeavoured
to
work
in
harmony
with
the
place
have
failed
there
is
a
gentle
and
puissant
harmonising
influence
in
oxford
which
nothing
can
escape
i
am
no
lover
of
georgian
architecture
and
am
often
blind
to
the
power
of
wren
but
in
oxford
i
have
no
such
incapacities
and
i
believe
that
here
architecture
should
be
judged
not
as
norman
or
classical
as
the
work
of
wolsey
or
aldrich
but
as
oxford
architecture
the
library
at
christ
church
or
any
other
work
of
the
eighteenth
century
seems
to
me
as
divine
a
thing
though
as
yet
it
lacks
the
complete
unction
of
antiquity
as
mob
quad
at
merton
or
magdalen
tower
to
pass
from
the
norman
work
of
peter
s
in
the
east
to
the
palladianism
of
peckwater
quadrangle
is
but
to
descend
from
one
to
another
of
the
same
honourable
race
if
certain
extremely
new
edifices
wear
out
a
thousand
years
they
will
probably
be
worthy
of
reverence
at
the
end
of
that
time
and
be
in
harmony
with
merton
chapel
and
balliol
hall
at
once
nothing
is
so
deserving
few
things
so
exacting
of
respect
from
transitory
men
as
age
things
change
and
improvements
are
questioned
or
questionable
but
for
me
age
is
as
good
as
an
improvement
and
oxford
honours
what
is
old
with
particular
dignities
and
graces
under
her
influence
the
work
of
age
is
at
once
blander
and
more
swift
but
this
gentle
tyranny
as
of
the
mother

john
with
outspread
hands
is
exerted
not
only
upon
the
stones
but
also
upon
the
people
of
the
place
a
man
may
at
oxford
rejoice
in
the
company
of
another
whom
it
is
a
to
meet
elsewhere
he
finds
himself
marvelling
that
one
who
was
merely
a
gentleman
in
london
can
be
interesting
in
long
wall
street
or
on
the
cherwell
the
superb
expensive
young
man
who
thinks
that
there
is
practically
nobody
in
oxford
the
poor
soiled
scholar
the
exuberant
athlete
whose
stride
is
a
challenge
his
voice
a
trumpet
call
the
lean
and
larded
Ã¦sthete
busily
engaged
upon
the
quaint
designs
of
oriental
life
all
discover
some
point
in
common
when
they
are
seen
together
in
the
schools
or
on
the
riverside
i
was
never
more
effectually
reminded
of
this
oxford
magic
than
when
i
heard
the
city
band
playing
opposite
university
one
day
i
was
indifferent
and
for
the
time
ignorant
and
incapable
of
knowing
whether
the
music
was
that
of
wagner
or
sousa
it
seemed
to
me
the
music
of
apollo
certainly
of
some
one
grander
than
all
grand
composers
and
yet
as
i
was
informed
what
i
had
entirely
loved
was
from
an
inferior
opera
which
every
street
boy
can
improve
it
was
another
music
and
yet
symphonious
that
i
heard
when
i
came
again
to
addison
s
walk
at
magdalen
i
stopped
at
magdalen
cloisters
on
my
way
o
blessed
shades
o
gentle
cool
retreat
from
all
th
immoderate
heat
in
which
the
frantic
world
does
burn
and
sweat
let
any
one
who
has
laughed
at
oxford
discipline
or
criticised
her
system
of
education
go
there
in
the
morning
early
and
be
abased
before
the
solemnity
of
that
square
lawn
and
should
he
be
left
with
a
desire
to
explain
anything
let
him
take
up
his
abode
with
the
stony
mysterious
beasts
gathered
around
that
lawn
i
like
that
grass
amidst
the
cloisters
because
it
is
truly
common
no
one
i
hope
and
believe
except
a
gardener
an
emblem
is
permitted
to
walk
thereon
it
belongs
to
me
and
to
you
and
to
the
angels
such
an
emerald
in
such
a
setting
is
a
fit
symbol
of
the
university
and
its
privy
seal
it
is
still
unnecessary
to
pass
an
examination
before
entering
addison
s
walk
it
is
therefore
unfrequented
a
financier
made
a
pretty
sum
one
by
accepting
gratuities
from
all
the
strangers
who
came
to
its
furthest
point
a
custom
older
than
king
but
although
they
are
not
vulgarly
so
called
these
walks
are
the
final
school
of
the
platonist
it
is
an
elucidation
of
the
phÃ¦do
to
pace
therein
that
pathway
is
the
place
of
long
thoughts
that
come
home
with
circling
footsteps
again
and
again
it
is
the
home
of
beech
and
elm
and
of
whatsoever
that
is
beautiful
and
wise
and
stately
dwells
among
beech
and
elm
more

oak

six
hundred
years

century

sir
thomas
white
was
warned
in
a
dream
to
build
a
college
at
a
place
where
there
stood
a
triple
elm
tree
hence
arose
john
s
college
two
hundred
years
ago
the
tree
was
known
to
exist

there
is
ground
for
the
pious
belief
that
a
scion
still
flourishes
there
nowhere
is
green
so
wonderful
as
at
magdalen
or
trinity
but
their
sweetness
is
no
more
than
the
highest
expression
of
the
privacy
of
oxford
turn
aside
at
the
gate
that
lies
nearest
your
path
enter
and
you
will
find
a

pay

should
have
been

seems
to
smile
upon

its
delicate
bells
but
the
stranger
never
learns
that
the
seclusion
of
oxford
is
perennial
and
that
only
in
the
vacations
may
he
suffer
from
what
the
old
pun
calls
the
place
is
habitually
almost
deserted
except
by
the
ghosts
of
the
dead
returning
to
it
when
friends
are
gone
and
every
one
is
a
stranger
the
echoes
of
our
footsteps
in
the
walls
are
as
the
voices
of
our
dead
selves
we
are
among
the
ghosts
the
past
is
omnipotent
even
terrible
echoes
quotes
montaigne
are
the
spirits
of
the
dead
and
among
these
mouldering
stones
we
may
put
our
own
interpretation
upon
that
and
no
one
that
has
so
returned
or
that
comes
a
reverent
stranger
for
the
first
time
to
oxford
can
read
without
deep
intelligence
the
lines
which
are
put
into
the
mouth
of
lacordaire
in
ionica
lost
to
the
church
and
deaf
to
me
this
town
yet
wears
the
reverend
garniture
of
peace
set
in
a
land
of
trade
like
gideon
s
fleece
bedewed
where
all
is
dry
the
pope
may
frown
but
if
this
city
is
the
shrine
of
youth
how
shall
the
preacher
lord
of
virgin
souls
when
by
glad
streams
and
laughing
lawns
he
strolls
how
can
he
bless
them
not
yet
in
sad
sooth
when
i
would
love
those
english
gownsmen
sighs
heave
my
frail
breast
and
weakness
dims
mine
eyes
these
strangers
heed
me
not
far
off
in
france
are
young
men
not
so
fair
and
not
so
cold
my
listeners
were
they
here
their
greeting
glance
might
charm
me
to
forget
that
i
were
old
some
time
ago
i
went
into
a
grey
quadrangle
filled
with
gusty
light
and
the
crimson
of
tremulous
or
already
in
flight
a
tall
poplar
the
favourite
of
the
months
from
april
to
october
was
pensively
distributing
its
foliage
upon
the
grass
there
the
leaves
became
invisible
because
of
brilliant
frost
and
in
a
high
attic
i
heard
once
again
the
laud
or
summons
or
complaint
of
bells
that
was
all
saints
that
mary
s
that
the
cathedral
s
and
that
was
their
blended
seeming
to
come
from
the
sky
each
bell
had
its
own
character
or
mood
sometimes
constant
sometimes
changing
with
the
weather
of
the
night
one
for
example
spoke
out
sullenly
and
ceased
as
if
to
return
to
musing
that
had
been
painfully
interrupted
another
bell
seemed
to
take
deep
joy
in
its
frequent
melodious
duty
like
some
girl
seated
alone
in
her
bower
at
easy
toil
now
and
then
lifting
her
head
and
with
her
embroidery
upon
her
knee
chanting
joys
past
and
present
and
yet
to
come
once
again
i
felt
the
mysterious
pleasure
of
being
in
an
elevated
oxford
chamber
at
night
among
cloud
and
star
so
that
i
seemed
to
join
in
the
inevitable
motion
of
the
planets
and
as
i
saw
the
sea
of
roofs
and
horned
turrets
and
spires
i
knew
that
although
architecture
is
a
dead
language
here
at
least
it
speaks
strongly
and
clearly
pompous
as
latin
subtle
as
greek
i
used
to
envy
the
on
days
of
ancient
festival
or
recent
victory
and
can
not
wonder
that
old
anthony
Ã 
wood
should
have
noted
the
eight
bells
of
merton
as
he
came
home
from
antiquarian
walks
and
would
often
ring
those
same
bells
for
recreation
s
when
their
sound
is
dead
it
is
sweet
to
enter
that
peacefullest
and
homeliest
of
churchyards
peter
s
in
the
east
overlooked
by
edmund
s
hall
and
queen
s

and
the
old
city
wall
there
is
a
peace
which
only
the
thrush
and
blackbird
break
and
even
their
singing
is
at
length
merely
the
most
easily
distinguishable
part
of
the
great
melody
of
the
place
most
of
the
graves
are
so
old
or
so
forgotten
that
it
is
easy
and
in
spring
it
is
difficult
not
to
perceive
a
kind
of
dim
reviving
life
among
the
stones
where
as
in
some
old
quiet
books
the
names
live
again
a
purged
and
untroubled
existence
in
oxford
nothing
is
the
creation
of
one
man
or
of
one
year
every
college
and
church
and
garden
is
the
work
of
centuries
of
men
and
time
many
a
stone
reveals
an
octave
of
colour
that
is
the
composition
of
a
long
age
the
founder
of
a
college
laid
his
plans
in
part
perhaps
he
fixed
them
in
stone
his
successors
continued
the
work
and
without
haste
without
contempt
of
the
future
or
ignorance
of
the
past
helped
the
building
to
ascend
unto
complete
beauty
by
means
of
its
old
and
imperfect
selves

legislate

in
the

have
been
foretold
and
in
fact
existed
in
some
latent
form
in
the
past
as
merlin
was
said
to
have
foretold
the
migration
of
oxford
scholars
from
cricklade
greeklade
therefore
in
oxford
alone
as
i
walk
i
seem
to
be
in
the
living
past
the
oldest
thing
is
not
as
in
most
places
a
curiosity
since
it
is
told
of
oxford
the
story
is
not
lightly
to
be
discredited
that
ludovicus
vives
who
was
sent
as
professor
of
rhetoric
by
wolsey
was
welcomed
by
a
swarm
of
bees
and
that
they
to
signify
the
incomparable
sweetness
of
his
eloquence
settled
under
the
leads
of
his
study
at
corpus
christi
college
and
there
for
a
hundred
and
thirty
years
continued
until
they
dispersed
out
of
sorrow
for
the
fallen
stuart
family
when
dawn
arrives
to
the
student
after
a
night
among
books
and
the
towers
and
spires
seem
to
be
just
fresh
from
the
acting
of
some
stately
drama
or
at
nightfall
when
the
bells
ring
as
he
comes
joyful
and
tired
home
from
the
west
then
the
city
and
all
its
component
ages
speak
out
as
if
the
past
were
but
a
fine
memory
richly
stored
and
ordered
once
answering
the
call
of
one
of
those
bells
that
are
to
a
scholar
as
a
trumpet
to
a
soldier
i
found
myself
at
a
service
that
had
in
it
elements
older
than
oxford
i
was
surely
at
a
greek
festival
the
genial
flushed
slightly
grotesque
faces
of
the
college
fellows
contrasted
with
the
white
children
of
the
choir
very
much
as
the
swarthy
faun
with
the
young
god
in
titian
s
bacchus
and
the
notes
of
the
choristers
and
of
the
organ
were
moulded
to
finer
results
by
the
severe
decorations
of
the
carven
stone
around
and
above
when
one
sang
alone
it
was
as
it
had
been
a
dove
floating
to
the
windows
and
away
away
there
were
parts
of
the
music
so
faint
and
so
exquisitely
blended
that
the
twenty
voices
were
but
as
the
sound
of
a
reverberating
bell
a
voice
of
baser
metal
read
the
lesson
with
a
melancholy
dignity
that
made
the
words
at
once
pleasing
and
unintelligible
when
the
last
surplice
had
floated
past
the
exit
the
worshippers
looked
a
little
pained
and
confused
as
if
doubting
whether
they
had
not
assisted
some
beautiful
rash
heresy
turning
into
high
street
i
was
rudely
called
back
from
a
fantastic
visit
to
tempe
by
the
wind
and
rain
of
every
day
the
usual
pageant
of
study
and
pleasure
was
passing
up
and
down
here
was
a
smiling
gentleman
red
as
the
opening
morn
with
black
clothes
white
tie
one
who
scoffs
at
everything
but
gout
he
notes
in
the
fragrance
of
his
favourite
dishes
omens
of
greater
import
than
augurs
used
to
read
from
sacrificial
victims
here
was
a
pale
seraph
his
eyes
commercing
with
the
sky
he
has
taken
every
possible
prize
nobody
but
his
friends
can
think
that
he
is
uninteresting
here
was
a
little
gentle
ascetic
one
of
the
last
enchantments
of
the
middle
ages
that
are
to
be
seen
still
walking
about
oxford
five
hundred
years
ago
he
might
have
ridden
coy
as
a
maid
to
canterbury
and
told
the
clerk
of
oxford
s
now
the
noises
of
the
world
are
too
much
for
him
and
he
murmurs
among
his
trees
how
safe
methinks
and
strong
behind
these
trees
have
i
encamped
my
mind
where
beauty
aiming
at
the
heart
bends
in
some
tree
its
useless
dart
and
where
the
world
no
certain
shot
can
make
or
me
it
toucheth
not
but
i
on
it
securely
play
and
gall
its
horsemen
all
the
day
bind
me
ye
woodbines
in
your
twines
curl
me
about
ye
gadding
vines
and
oh
so
close
your
circles
lace
that
i
may
never
leave
this
place
here
was
a
youth
not
much
past
seventeen
in
his
face
the
contends
with
the
pride
in
his
last
he
is
a
wide
and
subtle
reader
he
has
contributed
to
the
halfpenny
press
he
has
materialised
spirits
and
moved
objects
at
a
distance
in
the
world
there
is
little
left
for
him
except
repose
and
weak
tea
here
was
one
that
might
be
a
monk
and
might
equally
well
be
michael
with
flashing
eyes
and
high
white
forehead
that
catches
a
light
from
beyond
the
dawn
and
glows
he
is
a
splendour
among
men
as
he
walks
in
the
crowd
of
high
churchmen
low
churchmen
broad
churchmen
nonconformists
and
men
who
on
sunday
wear
bowler
hats
here
was
a
shy
don
married
to
calliope
a
brilliant
companion
one
who
shares
a
wisdom
as
deep
and
almost
as
witty
as
montaigne
s
with
a
few
fellows
of
colleges
and
ever
murmuring
here
was
one
watched
over
alike
by
the
muses
and
the
graces
athletic
who
would
rather
spend
a
life
in
deciding
between
the
greek
and
roman
ideals
than
in
ruling
parliament
and
being
ruled
by
society
he
strode
like
a
plantagenet
when
he
stood
still
he
was
a
classical
hermes
here
was
a
blue
with
shy
but
conscious
look
and
there
the
best
of
all
vices
here
was
a
youth
with
gaudy
tie
who
believed
that
he
was
leading
a
but
showed
a
wise
acquiescence
in
the
intricate
canine
etiquette
may
his
dog
not
cease
before
him
here
was
a
martial
creature
walking
six
miles
an
hour
pensively
in
his
master
s
gown
his
beard
always
blown
over
his
shoulder
has
been
an
inspiration
to
generations
of
undergraduates
and
with
his
bellying
gown
gives
him
a
resemblance
to
boreas
or
notus
probably
because
the
able
novelist
has
not
visited
oxford
men
move
about
its
streets
more
naÃ¯vely
and
with
more
expression
in
their
faces
than
anywhere
else
in
the
world
there
you
may
do
anything
but
carry
a
as
i
write
fashion
has
changed
her
mind
and
of
the
more
flippant
kinds
are
commonly
in
use
there
are
therefore
more
unmasked
faces
in
half
of
turl
street
than
in
the
whole
of
the
strand
almost
every
one
appears
to
have
a
sense
of
part
proprietorship
in
the
city
walks
as
if
he
were
in
his
own
garden
has
no
fear
lest
he
should
be
caught
smiling
to
himself
or
as
midnight
approaches
even
singing
loudly
to
himself
a
don
will
not
hesitate
to
make
the
worst
joke
in
a
strong
and
cheerful
voice
in
the
bookseller
s
shop
when
it
is
full
of
clever
freshmen
yonder
they
go
the
worldly
and
the
unworldly
the
rich
and
poor
high
and
low
proving
that
oxford
is
one
of
the
most
democratic
places
in
europe
the
lax
discipline
that
broadens
the
horizon
of
the
inexpert
stranger
is
probably
neither
unwise
nor
unpremeditated
it
is
certainly
not
inconsistent
with
the
genius
of
a
city
whose
very
stones
may
be
supposed
to
have
acquired
an
educative
faculty
and
a
sweet
presence
that
is
not
to
be
put
by
no
fool
ever
went
up
without
becoming
at
least
a
coxcomb
before
he
came
down
in
no
place
are
more
influences
brought
to
bear
upon
the
mind
though
it
is
emphatically
a
place
where
a
man
is
expected
to
educate
himself
a
man
is
apt
to
feel
on
first
entering
oxford
and
still
more
on
leaving
it
that
the
beautiful
city
is
unfortunate
in
having
but
mortal
minds
to
teach
there
is
a
keen
and
sometimes
pathetic
sense
of
a
great
music
which
one
can
not
wholly
follow
a
light
unapprehended
a
wisdom
not
realised
yet
much
is
to
be
guessed
at
or
privily
understood
when
we
behold
mary
s
spire
marvellously
attended
and
crowned
when
the
night
is
one
sapphire
by
cassiopeia
and
the
ghosts
take
shape
the
cowled
mitred
sceptred
company
of
founders
benefactors
scholars
philosophers
and
the
later
soldiers
poets
statesmen
and
wits
and
finally
some
one
among
the
rich
in
influence
of
yesterday
who
embodies
for
one
or
another
of
us
the
sweetness
of
the
place
for
me
when
the
first
splendour
of
the
city
in
my
imagination
has
somewhat
grown
dim
i
see
in
the
midst
and
on
high
a
room
little
wider
than
the
thickness
of
its
walls
which
were
part
stone
part
books
for
the
books
fitted
naturally
into
the
room
leaving
spaces
only
for
a
bust
of
plato
a
portrait
of
sir
thomas
browne
a
decanter
and
a
window
commanding
sky
and
clouds
and
stars
above
an
horizon
of
many
towers
there
too
is
a
great
fire
a
dowager
brown
teapot
with
a
pair
of
slippers
and
to
get
into
them
was
no
whit
less
magical
than
into
the
boots

a
chair

a
man
might
sit
curled
with
the
largest
folio
and
be
hidden
i
guess
at
the
face
of
the
man
under
the
folio
he
was
a
small
shrunken
elvish
figure
with
a
smile
like
the
first
of
june
often
budding
in
a
face
like
the
last
of
december
in
rest
that
face
was
grim
as
if
carved
in
limestone
in
expression
like
waters
in
spring
his
curled
ebony
hair
had
a
singular
freshness
and
hint
of
vitality
that
gave
the
lie
to
his
frail
form
and
husky
voice
cut
in
wood
the
large
nose
and
chin
peering
forward
would
have
served
well
as
the
of
a
merry
ship
and
to
me
he
seemed
indeed
to
travel
on
such
a
ship
towards
a
land
that
no
other
man
desires
his
talk
was
ever
of
men
fighting
ploughing
singing
and
how
fair
women

would
hail

he
saw
her
from

verse
when

in

is
hidden

by
what

speak

the
verses
seem
to
maturer
eyes

as
crude
translations
out
of
silence
yet
in
the
old
days
we
called
him
sometimes
the
last
sometimes
the
first
of
the
bards
so
nimble
and
radiant
was
his
spirit
he
seemed
one
that
might
have
written
in
his
youth
after
a
pot
of
sack
with
shakespeare
at
the
crown
in
cornmarket
street
i
know
not
whether
to
call
him
immemorially
old
or
young
he
had
touches
of
the
golden
age
and
as
it
were
a
tradition
from
the
singer

was
in

ship
which
first
through
the
euxine
seas
bore
all
the
flower
of
greece
unlike
other
clever
people
in

was
brilliant
in

rise

talk

write
at

sing
hunting
ditties
amid
the
snow
to
the
leaden
east
and
the
frozen
starlings
by
marston
or
above
wytham
and
eynsham
his
laugh
fell
upon
our
ears
like
an
echo
from
arcadian
existences
it
was
in
harmony
with
the
songs
of
thrushes
and
the
murmur
of
the
evenlode
coming
into
his
room
we
expected
to
see
a
harp
at
his
side
but
where
are
the
voices
that
we
heard
and
uttered
are
they
exiled
out
of
stony

thy

itself
to

thee

art
thou
old

thy

i

thee

to
britain

burning
city

to
oxford
the
trojans
brought
certain
greek
philosophers

at
that
early
date
illustrated
the
universal
hospitality
and
independence
of
nationality
and
language
that
were
so
characteristic
before
the
place
became
a
stuart
park
and
as
the
athenians
had
in
their
city
and
its
attendant
landscape
all
those
natural
beauties
and
utilities
which
make
possible
a
peerless
academy
so
also
had
the
britons
says
anthony
Ã 
wood
herein
agreeing
with
polydore
vergil
when
by
a
remnant
of
the
grecians
that
came
amongst
them
they
or
their
successors
selected
such
a
place
in
britain
to
plant
a
school
or
schools
therein
which
for
its
pleasant
situation
was
afterwards
called
or
now
among
these
generous
suppositions
or
dreams
was
the
story
that
apollo
at
the
downfall
of
the
olympians
flying
now
to
rome

now
to
athens
found
at
last
something
congenial
in

oak
woods

waters
of
oxford

a
bride
in
the
puissant
nymph
of

which
favoured
site

was
fitting

afterwards
arose
a
place

the
learning

architectural
beauty
of
athens
the
divine
inspiration
of
delphi
and
the
natural
loveliness
of
delos
there
is
said
anthony
Ã 
wood
an
old
tradition
that
goeth
from
father
to
son
of
our
inhabitants
which
much
derogateth
from
the
antiquity
of
this
city

that
is
when
frideswyde
had
bin
soe
long
absent
from
hence
she
came
from
binsey
triumphing
with
her
virginity
into
the
city
mounted
on
a
ox
betokening
innocency

as
she
rode
along
the
streets
she
would
forsooth
be

her
ox

there

never

quite
appropriately
magnificent

canonical
fiction
for

is
for

still
a
pleasant
haze
that
might
encourage
a
poet

a
herald

over
the
early
history

it
is
unlikely
that
the
place
was
of
importance
in
roman
times
later
its
position
on
a
river
and
a
boundary
brought
it
many
sufferings
at
the
hands
of
dane
and
saxon

no
one
need
fear
to
believe
that
early
in
the
eighth
century
didan
an
under
king
and
his
daughter
frideswide
established
there
a
nunnery
and
built
a
church
of
stone
now
perhaps
mingled
with
the
later
masonry
it
was
rebuilt
by
ethelred
in
the
eleventh

pierce
beyond
john
giffard
s
foundation
and
the
preceding
carmelites
to
the
earliest
lovers
of
learning
who
loved
oxford
too
at
mary
s
the
work
of
the
fancy
is
easier
and
more
sure
there
the
university
books
and
there
a
money
chest
reposed
there
were
the
highest
deliberations
and
ceremonies
there
a
man
was
graduated
and
from
its
porch
he
passed
out
a
clerk
of
oxford
if
the
university
was
early
associated
with
a
place
of
holiness
and
beauty
still
more
firmly
was
it
rooted
in
a
becoming
poverty
it
had
neither
a
roof
nor
a
certain
purse
for
years
it
had
not
a
name
the
university
was
in
fact
but
a
spirit
of
wisdom
and
grace
men
had
heard
of
it
and
sought
it
and
where
one
or
two
were
gathered
together
to
take
advantage
of
it
there
was
her
school
and
her
only
endowment
now
and
then
to
such
a
group
came
in
a
legacy
of
books
or
gold
but
that
was
a
crop
for
which
no
one
sowed
and
before
it
was
possible
it
had
been
rumoured
that
there
was
something
in
oxford
not
visible
yet
very
present
and
necessary
and
scholars
came
with
as
great
zeal
as
was
ever
cherished
by
reports
of
gold
they
brought
what
in
their
devotion
they
came
to
seek
thus
gerald
of
wales
came
and
for
three
days
read
aloud
his
glorious
book
to
large
audiences
every
day
was
marked
by
sumptuous
and
generous
feasts
it
was
indeed
a
costly
and
noble
act
as
he
says
himself
for
the
authentic
and
ancient
times
of
the
poets
were
thus
in
some
measure
carmelites
dominicans
and
franciscans
and
vivid
men
from
the
university
of
paris
came
to
teach
even
then
the
university
quarrelled
with
the
town
over
the
price
of
victuals
and
rooms
and
invaded
the
extortionate
jew
there
about
the
streets
walked
the
magnificent
franciscans
roger
bacon
and
grosseteste
and
the
pure
and
gracious
and
learned
thomas
cantelupe
early
in
the
nineteenth
century
there
was
a
chancellor
set
over
the
scholars
by
the
bishop
of
lincoln
in
whose
diocese
oxford
lay
very
soon
the
chancellor
was
elected
by
the
university
and
the
masters
in
congregation
could
legislate
and
sometimes
did
although
questions
were
often
effectually
decided
by
a
popular
vote
among
the
students
who
also
themselves
chose
by
vote
the
heads
of
their
hostels
or
halls
for
there
were
at
an
early
date
houses
already
associated
with
learning
and
governed
either
by
a
common
landlord
or
by
a
scholar
of
some
standing
and
age
there
a
man
might
read
and
comfort
himself
according
to
his
means
and
finally
at
night
stamp
up
and
down
a
passage
to
warm
his
feet
before
going
to
sleep
in
a
crowded
on
any
day
there
was
a
chance
that
some
splendid
man
coming
a
little
in
the
rear
of
his
fame
would
arrive
in
oxford
and
lecture
or
read
a
book
should
kings
or
priests
or
rude
citizens
interfere
the
scholar
could
rusticate
voluntarily
as
he
sometimes
did
at
stamford
or
reading
or
maidstone
or
cambridge
and
there
as
best
he
might
by
study
and
as
by
a
sacrament
recreate
the
university
the
city
and
until
our
own
time
the
crown
had
to
pay
in
round
sums
for
such
an
insult
as
the
hanging
of
several
scholars
the
money
lined
the
bottom
of
frideswide
s
chest
a
man
with
no
possessions
but
the
leaf
of
a
manuscript
or
a
dagger
or
a
cloak
left
it
with
the
keepers
of
the
chest
as
security
for
a
loan
whether
he
were
welsh
or
hungarian
or
italian
or
french
an
englishman
william
of
durham
who
had
enjoyed
the
university
hospitality
at
paris
first
kindled
the
flame
which
was
to
be
kept
burning
by
so
many
afterwards
as
a
for
the
homeless
student

left
paris
after
a
quarrel
along
with
many
french
students
whom
henry
iii
welcomed
to
oxford
in
william
went
to
rome
before
returning
to
england
and
remembered
oxford
when
he
lay
dying
at
rouen
perchance
reminded
there
of
the
city
which
until
fifty
years
ago
was
equal
with
it
in
ancient
beauty
and
has
been
clouded
in
the
same
way
he
left
in
his
will
a
sum
of
money
to
the
university

was
employed
in
making
more
steadfast

for
oxford
students
at
a
house
for
example

stood

not

them
the

a

deserves

henceforward
there
were

to

preparation
for

william
of
durham
was
the
first
to
leave
money
the
founders
of
balliol
the
first
to
gather
a
number
of
scholars
under
one
roof
with
a
corporate
life
and
as
we
may
assume
a
set
of
customary
unwritten
laws
but
walter
de
merton
was
the
first
to
endow
and
provide
with
tenements
and
statutes
a
college
in
all
important
respects
like
a
college
of
a
place
even
at
that
time
standing
in
a
genial
avuncular
relationship
towards
the
students
which
was
rich
in
influence
and
the
making
of
endearing
tradition
perhaps
the
merton
treasury
still
conspicuous
for
its
steep
roof
and
burliness
was
part
of
the
founder
s
gift
and
no
building
could
have
been
a
fitter
nest
of
an
idea
which
was
for
so
long
to
make
little
of
time
the
hall
retains
some
features
of
the
same
date
almost
at
once
the
chapel
began
to
rise
and
its
light
was
coloured
by
the
topmost
glass
just
as
it
is
in
fact
merton
with
its
older
little
sister
foundation
of
alban
hall
was
until
the
of
butterfield
in
itself
a
symbol
of
the
origin
and
growth
of
oxford
as
a
collegiate
university
and
as
a
place
of
beauty
the
royal
dervorguilla
was
the
godmother
of
the
kindly
college
life
of
she
was
the
wife
of
the
founder
of
balliol
and
was
often
in
oxford
with
her
honoured
franciscan
richard
of
slikeburne
to
look
after
her
sixteen
scholars
at
old
balliol
hall
in
horsemonger
street
now
broad
street
close
by
at
the
church
of
mary
magdalen
she
devised
an
oratory
for
the
balliol
men
they
chose
their
own
principal
who
presided
at
disputations
and
meals
they
had
breakfast
and
supper
together
and
the
more
comfortable
of
them
paid
anything
in
excess
of
their
allowance
which
the
expenses
of
the
common
table
might
demand
one
poor
scholar
lived
on
the
crumbs
thus
were
men
less
often
compelled
to
borrow
from
the
jews
at
per
cent
on
the
security
of
their
books

balliol
was

progressing

carved
on
the
base
of

it
was
of
this
period
that
the
story
was
told
that
two
barefooted
hungry
travellers
from
the
west
were
approaching
oxford
and
had
come
in
sight
of
it
near
cumnor
when
they
found
a
beautiful
woman
seated
by
the
wayside
so
beautiful
was
she
that
they
knelt
at
her
feet
being
simple
regina
they
cried
then
she
bending
forward
and
speaking
they
were
first
surprised
that
she
should
speak
to
them
and
next
ventured
to
speak
to
her
and
ask
her
name
whereat
she
raised
her
small
golden
head
so
that
in
the
sun
her
hair
seemed
to
flow
and
flow
continually
down
and
looked
towards
oxford
there
two
spires
and
two
towers
could
just
be
seen
betwixt
the
oak
trees
my
name
she
said
is
known
to
all
men
save
you
it
is
pulchritudo
and
that
as
she
pointed
to
the
shining
stones
of
the
city
is
my
those
two
were
silent
between
amazement
and
joy
until
one
said
it
is
our
lady
and
the
other
lo
it
is
venus
and
she
sits
upon
many
waters
hardly
had
they
resumed
their
ordinary
pace
when
they
found
an
old
man
seated
by
the
wayside
very
white
and
yet
very
pleasant
and
alluring
to
so
to
him
also
the
simple
wayfarers
knelt
down
then
that
old
man
bent
forward
and
spoke
to
them
with
golden
words
and
only
the
one
who
had
called
the
beautiful
woman
venus
dared
to
speak
he
it
was
that
questioned
the
old
man
about
the
woman
and
about
himself
my
name
is
sapientia
he
said
and
that
is
my
home
he
continued
and
looked
towards
oxford
where
two
spires
and
two
towers
could
just
be
seen
betwixt
the
oak
trees
and
he
concluded
solemnly
that
woman
is
my
mother
and
she
grows
not
the
men
went
their
way
one
saying
it
is
a
place
of
lies
the
other
saying
it
is
wonderful
and
when
they
looked
back
the
old
man
and
the
beautiful
woman
had
vanished
in
the
city
they
were
often
seen
but
the
two
strangers
could
not
speak
with
them
for
they
were
greatest
in
the
city
of
oxford
some
said
that
he
was
an
austin
friar
and
she
a
light
woman
but
they
are
not
to
be
and
when
they
had
dwelt
in
oxford
a
short
time
and
had
seen
what
store
of
pious
and
learned
and
illuminated
books
were
in
the
halls
and
what
costly
and
fine
things
in
its
churches
and
convents
the
one
said
i
believe
that
what
sapientia
and
pulchritudo
said
was
the
truth
and
the
other
said
truly
the
city
is
worthy
of
them
both
wherefore
they
dwelt
there
until
their
deaths
and
found
it
the
most
loving
and
lovely
city

years
they
had
little
more

the

of

welsh

college
there
were

northerners
at

times
these
divisions
were
emphasised
by
conflicts
with

overlooked
their
aristotle
at
bloody
arguments
in

and

between
north

irish
and
welsh
and
scotch
in
combinations
that
varied

remembering

booths
of

by

he
fought

of

wake
and
an
exchange
of
lusty
oaths
between
men
of

parties
were
the
occasion
in

years
realists
and
nominalists
orthodox
and
wycliffites
now
and
then
reduced
their
disagreement
to
simple
terms
nor
were
the
citizens
with
difficulty
persuaded
to
take
or
make
a
side
in
the
disputes
whether
they
encountered
the
scholars
at
inns
or
as
they
stood
on

of
hay
and
faggots

some

a

with

embattled
themselves
and
sought
out
the

with
bent

crying
to
the

and
their
whelps
that
an
owen
or
a

who
looked

at

was
a

the
welshmen
were
driven
out
of
the

with
ignominy
and
blood
the

robbed
and
murdered
indiscriminately

destroyed
not

they
were
incontinently
appeased
on

burst
in
on

upon

spread

were
crimsoned
but
the

who
led

untimely
shot
down

his

evaporated
some

fled
to
the

some
to
sanctuary
and
were
comforted
by
the
excommunication
and
fining
of
their
opponents
after
a
similar
fight
the
university
was
allowed

exemption
from

it
still
enjoys

the

earned
very
cheaply
for
the
university
concessions
which
put
the
citizens
at

disadvantage
and
emphasised
distinctions
so
as
to
cause
other
disturbances
in

henry
himself
a
queen

man
at

interfered
with
an
order
that
scholars
would
only
be
treated
as
such
if
they
were
under
the
rule
of
an
approved
head
it

to

listening
to
for
a
time
the
grecians
were
ridiculed
and
attacked
in
the
streets
by
men
who
called
themselves
priam
hector
and
paris
and
behaved
like
trojans
in
that
first
enthusiasm
men
seemed
very
near
to
the
inaccessible
gods
perhaps
some
were
disposed
to
follow
pico
della
mirandola
in
pursuit
of
them
there
was
therefore
a
party
which
opposed
the
study
of
greek
as
heretical
and
more
was
withdrawn
from
oxford
to
avoid
the
danger
from
the
beautiful
magdalen
cloisters
came
the
men
who
launched
corpus
christi
college
just
after
erasmus
had
published
the
new
testament
in
greek
and
the
ancient
brasenose
hall
had
at
last
grown
into
a
college
the
founder
gave
copies
of
homer
herodotus
plato
and
horace
which
still
survive
there
was
a
public
lecturer
in
greek
on
the
foundation
erasmus
himself
applauded
and
prophesied
liberally
of
its
future
it
was
the
new
college
of
the
renaissance
as
wykeham
s
had
been
of
the
middle
ages
the
readers
were
to
be
chosen
from
england
or
greece
or
italy
and
among
the
first
members
of
the
college
was
the
mystical
bavarian
dialler
nicholas
kratzer
who
made
a
dial
in
corpus
garden
and
that
exquisite
one
for
wolsey
which
is
to
be
seen
in
drawing
in
the
library
wolsey
s
own
college
was
built
over
against
frideswide
s
part
of
which
together
with
one
side
of
its
cloisters
was
destroyed
to
give
it
place
it
contained
the
largest
quadrangle
and
the
most
princely
kitchen
in
oxford
when
henry
the
eighth
spoiled
the
monasteries
the
bells
of
osney
were
carried
to
christ
church
and
one
of
them
over
wolsey
s
gateway
does
what
it
can
to
illustration
the
cloisters
magdalen
college
the
hall
and
chapel
of
the
college
stretch
nearly
across
the
picture
immediately
in
front
of
the
spectator
the
oriel
window
which
lights
the
daÃ¯s
of
the
hall
marking
the
division
between
the
west
end
of
the
hall
and
the
east
end
of
the
chapel
farther
west
and
closely
adjoining
the
chapel
at
the
angle
of
the
cloisters
rises
the
founder
s
tower
a
gateway
under
the
tower
leads
to
the
quadrangle
of
john
the
baptist
and
the
entrance
to
the
college
the
figures
above
the
buttresses
of
the
cloisters
were
probably
not
designed
for
their
present
position
but
add
to
the
picturesqueness
of
the
cloisters
which
it
will
be
observed
project
from
the
main
body
of
the
buildings
above
the
gleaming
roof
of

the
beautiful
bell
tower
of
the
college
detached
and
built
at
a
different
angle
from
the
hall
and

which
are
continued
in
the
same
line
the
tower
is
feet
high
and
was
completed
about
men
in
masters
gowns
walk
and
converse
on
the
grass
the
time
is
late
afternoon
call
the
undergraduates
home
at
nine
with
a
deep
voice
as
if
it
spoke
through
its
beard
which
pretends
to
be
b
flat
as
the
old
leonine
hexameter
says
hark
the
bonny
christ

bells
they
sound
so
wondrous
great
so
wondrous
sweet
as
they
trowl
so
merrily
merrily
oh
the
first
and

that
every
day
at
four
and
ten
cry
come
come
come
to
prayers
and
the
verger
troops
before
the
dean
tinkle
tinkle
ting
goes
the
small
bell
at
nine
to
call
the
bearers
home
but
the
devil
a
man
will
leave
his
can
till
he
hears
the
mighty
tom
so
runs
the
catch
of
a
later
dean
at
christ
church
also
there
was
a
lecturer
in
greek
the
dialler
kratzer
was
made
mathematical
professor
wolsey
s
chapel
never
rose
above
a
few
feet
in
height
and
the
uncompleted
walls
remained
for
a
century
frideswide
s
became
almost
at
the
same
time
the
cathedral
of
the
see
of
oxford
and
the
chapel
of
the
college
the
grandiose
christ
church
kitchen
which
caused
so
much
laughter
because
it
was
the
cardinal
s
first
contribution
to
his
college
was
in
fact
rather
characteristic
of
the
age
that
followed
it
was
built
with
the
revenues
of
suppressed
monasteries
it
was
almost
contemporaneous
with
the
destruction
of
many
priceless
books
by
reformers
who
were
as
ignorant
of
what
is
dangerous
in
books
as
a
russian
censor
the
shelves
of
duke
humphrey
s
library
were
denuded
and
sold
the
shrine
of
frideswide
s
where
the
university
had
long
offered
reverence
twice
a
year
was
shattered
the
fragments
were
used
here
and
there
in
the
buildings
of
the
time
the
relics
of
the
saint
were
husbanded
by
a
pious
few
in
hope
of
a
restoration
but
they
were
finally
interred
with
those
of
peter
martyr
s
wife
a
significant
mixture
it
was
the
age
when
the
university
became
the
playground
of
the
richer
classes
and
the
nobleman
s
son
took
the
place
of
the
poor
scholar
in
a
fellowship
now
men
found
time
to
dispute
with
cambridge
as
to
which
university
was
of
the
greatest
antiquity
the
arguments
put
forward
in
oxford
were
seldom
more
convincing
than
this
that
oxford
was
named
from
a
ford
cambridge
from
a
bridge
and
since
the
ford
must
have
been
older
than
the
bridge
oxford
was
therefore
founded
first
greek
for
the
time
decayed
and
the
founder
of
trinity
college
feared
that
its
restoration
was
impossible
in
that
age
as
to
latin
sir
philip
sidney
who
was
at
christ
church
told
his
brother
that
ciceronianism
was
become
an
abuse
among
the
oxonians
who
neglected
things
for
oxford
was
dignified
mainly
by
the
architecture
of
christ
church
by
the
foundation
of
trinity
john
s
and
jesus
college
all
on
learned
and
holy
ground
by
the
martyrdom
of
latimer
and
ridley
opposite
balliol
and
by
great
names
like
those
of
burton
and
marston
at
brasenose
peele
at
broadgates
hall
pembroke
raleigh
at
oriel
hooker
at
corpus
christi
religion
was
still
in
the
pot
and
men
could
not
confidently
tell
what
it
would
turn
out
to
be
on
the
one

in

the
earl
of

and
confirmed

john
lyly

the
fiddlestick
of

magdalen
men
lovers
of

especially
in

and

still

the
end
of
the
century
the
most
effective
oxford
man
of
his
time
william
laud
became
fellow
of
john

he
built
a
new
quadrangle
and
as
chancellor
made
of
the
statutes
that
long
and
whip
which
every
one
knows
he
created
modern
broad
street
by
deleting
the
cottages
which
stood
near
and
opposite
to

the
impressive
uncomfortable
convocation
house
was
his
work
within

of
it
was
the
library
which
sir
thomas
bodley
earlier
in
the
century
had
built
and
stored

the
first
of
the
improvers
of
oxford
was
beginning
the
work
of
destruction
which
the
puritans
continued
so
well
but
it
was
then
the
good
fortune
of
several
colleges
to
receive
large
additions
of
a
simple
and
homely
character
which
did
more
than
any
others
to
make
oxford
what
it
is
it
was
the
age
of
the
retired
lincoln
college
chapel
with
its
carved
panels
of
perfumed
cedar
and
rich
quaint
glass
the
placid
garden

of
wadham
as
seen
through
the

converted
from

by
a
clothier

pembroke
and

and
opened
with
ceremonies
which
included
a
fantastic
latin
oration
by
sir
thomas
browne
as
senior
undergraduate
the
architecture
of
wadham
is
a
remarkable
proof
of
the
influence
of
antiquity
upon
men
and
things
in
oxford
the
founders
in
were
nicholas
wadham
and
dorothy
his
wife
of
merifield
in
somerset
the
builders
were
mainly
west
country
men
and
worked
in
that
lingering
gothic
style
which
was
still
vital
in
oxford
and
seems
to
have
guided
the
hand
of
wren
if
it
was
wren
when
he
planned
the
fan
tracery
of
brasenose
library
but
in
the
building
of
wadham
chapel
one
john
spicer
and
his
men
seem
to
have
been
haunted
by
the
beauty
of
the
perpendicular
churches
of
their
native
somerset
the
windows
are
so
clear
a
reconstruction
of
this
dream
that
an
experienced
judge
refused
to
believe
that
they
were
of
later

than
christ

did

to

was
a
lover
of

that

library

utterly
the
chief
objection
to
the
intruded
fellows

heads
of

seems
to
have
been
that
they
were
intruded
and
were
likely
to
stay
as
for
their
accomplishments
though
some
lacked
humour
they
seem
to
have
been

loyal

oxford
new

of

by

those
ancient
ceremonies

institutions
as
yet
not
wholly
at

heard

performed
by

ingenious
at

the

ancient

the
scrupulosity
of

the

at

was
in
pontificial
order

only
i
think
turned
then
he
dined
at
wadham
and
wrote
down
an
account
of
what
he
saw
at

that
most
obliging
and
universally
curious
the
transparent
apiaries
hollow
speaking
statues
dials
waywisers
and
other
artificial
mathematical
and
magical
curiosities
which
he
saw
well
illustrate
the
activities
of
the
time
in
the
cradle
of
the
royal
society
a
little
after
wren
came
thomas
traherne
the

in

coarse
frivolous
age

was
welcomed
to

by
music
and
ceremony
the
conduit
ran
claret
for
the
but
when
he
adventured
to
force
his
nominee
into
the
presidentship
of
magdalen
he
could
not
even
procure
a

to
burst

door
again
the
university
stood
to
arms
to
oppose
monmouth
s
rebellion
and
clothed
its
members
in
scarlet
coats
with
scarves
and
hats
but
had
to
be
contented
with
the
bonfires
in
celebration
of
the
victory
at
sedgemoor
and
a
parade
not
long
afterwards
many
yards
of
orange
ribbon
made
the
high
street
gaudy
with
a
pretence
at
honouring
william
iii
but
the
colleges
were
vigorously
jacobite
and
proved
it
by
drinking
the
healths
of
the
stuarts
as
long
as
they
could
merton
exeter
all
souls
and
wadham
were
the
exceptions
one
example
of
the
lighter
occupations
of
the
period
is
to
be
found
in
a
story
of
somewhat
earlier
date
told
of
bathurst
and
president
of
trinity
a
striking
instance
of
zeal
for
his
college
in
the
dotage
of
old
age
is
yet
remembered
balliol
college
had
suffered
so
much
in
the
outrages
of
the
grand
rebellion
that
it
remained
almost
in
a
state
of
desolation
for
some
years
after
the
restoration
a
circumstance
not
to
be
suspected
from
its
flourishing
condition
ever
since
bathurst
was
perhaps
secretly
pleased
to
see
a
neighbouring
and
once
rival
society
reduced
to
this
condition
while
his
flourished
beyond
all
others
accordingly
one
afternoon
he
was
found
in
his
garden
which
then
ran
almost
continuous
to
the
east
side
of
balliol
college
throwing
stones
at
the
windows
with
much
satisfaction
as
if
happy
to
contribute
his
share
in
completing
the
appearance
of
its
i
seem
to
find
an
echo
of
the
sentiment
of
very
different
men
with
a
love
of
the
old
time
amidst
the
politics
and
wine
of
the
day
in
aubrey

ejaculation
he
wished
that

had
not

been

a

twould
have
been
to

odd

thomas

but
had
fallen
away
after

was
in
short
almost
a
possession
of
nettles

edge
of

the
dreamy
plan
was
soon
parched
and
destroyed
in
the
odour
of
scandal
after
much
trifling
procrastination
the
greeks
were
succeeded
by
worcester
college
and
a
lucky
poverty
left
the
worn
old
buildings
for
a
little
longer
untroubled

library
a
hall
and
a
chapel
were
prepared
for
the
new
society
wide
spaces
of
land
on
every
side
of
it
were
retained

acquired
which
afterwards
gave
the

a
fat
rent

its
incomparable
bosky
and
watered
garden
while
worcester
was
being
founded
in
the
conventional

was
developed

as

at

dean
aldrich
of
christ
church
had
a
hand
or
a
word
this
clever
and
genial
tutor
was
one
of
the
best
men
of
his
day
and
quite
typical
of
the
early
eighteenth
century
he
seems
to
have
been
one
to
whom
action
came
more
naturally
than
dreams
if
he
dreamed
at
all
and
he
could
easily
express
the
many
sides
of
his
personality
in
a
lasting
way
a
happy
and
golden
mediocrity
he
encouraged
boyle
in
the
dazzling
indiscretion
of
epistles
of
he
wrote

enduring
oxford
logic

perhaps
this

on

i
rightly

there

being
dry
or
lest
we
should

historians
often
entitle
one
of
their
chapters
the
dark
or
iron
age
and
indeed
as
a
school
of
universal
learning
the
oxford
of
that
day
might
be
called
in
question
it
was
more
aristocratic
and
exclusive
perhaps
than
it
had
ever
been
and
it
failed
to
justify
itself
what
class
in
life
it
was
a
song
by
a
fellow
in
a
play
of
the
period
what
class
in
life
tho
ne
er
so
great
with
a
good
fellowship
can
compare
and
in
the
same
play
says
one
of
horace
he
was
a
jolly
dog
and
i
believe
formerly
might
be
fellow
at
a
yet
in
our
backward
glances
over
oxford
history
how
often
do
we
stop
when
we
reach
that
age
whether
we
are
drinking
from
an
old
reminding
tankard
with
the
date
or
looking
at
one
of
its
books
or
living
in
one
of
the
rooms
which
it
wainscotted
or
furnished
heavily
but
how
genially
you
are
a
philosopher
johnson
said
edwards
his
college
friend
i
have
tried
too
in
my
time
to
be
a
philosopher
but
i
don
t
know
how
cheerfulness
was
always
breaking
cheerfulness
broke
in
pretty
often
in
oxford
and
that
was
a
time
when
there
was
more
love
of
oxford
than
ever
before
even
the
wealthy
fellows
of
all
souls
that
eden
to
the
fruitful
mind
as
lady
winchilsea
called
it
at
that
time
never
bought
their
college
and
when
one
of
them
was
taunted
with
the
quip
that
oxford
was
less
learned
than
bath
he
was
able
to
reply
that
it
was
also
more
fashionable
i
find
too
in
its
love
of
the
past
as
in
its
love
of
nature
something
heartier
though
i
daresay
less
mystical
than
our
own
johnson
s
love
of
pembroke
is
an
example
he
had
lived
there
as
an
undergraduate
only
fourteen
months
and
there
seems
to
have
been
little
that
was
tangible
to
take
hold
of
him
in
so
short
a
time
yet
when
he
came
back
long
after
and
heard
old
camden
s
grace
after
meat
which
they
still
use
he
was
at
home
it
is
true
that
men
of
that
age
could
as
little
appreciate
its
blank
verse
as
we
can
compose
it
but
there
were
many
who
could
then
appreciate
what
we
can
now
only
describe
the
country
in
summer
antiquity
good
living
were
fine
things
but
when
they
wrote
it
was
theology
or
morals
or
inaccurate
philology
there
was
a
man
long
ago
with
god
who
after
much
waiting
obtained
a
fine
coveted
room
at
new
college
instead
of
writing
a
sonnet
forthwith
he
expressed
a
wish
to
kick
some
one
downstairs
incontinently
on
one
occasion
it
is
said
the
head
of
a
college
and
a
great
lover
of
oxford
who
was
jocund
and
recumbent
after
a
feast
was
with
great
circumstance
invited
by
several
wags
to
accept
the
crown
of
this
old
and
famous
kingdom
since
king
george
has
to
which
he
slowly
replied
without
surprise
that
if
we
can
hold
our
court
of
james
s
in
this
common
room
we
shall
not
warton
s
to
the
and
wood
s
are
full
of
what
we
should
call
poor
oxford
humour
but
i
think
there
is
sufficient
indication
of
the
laughter
it
caused
to
make
us
pause
in
any
condemnation
of
it
as
compared
with
our
own
thoughtful
mirth
which
illustration
the
radcliffe
library
or
camera
bodleiana
from
all

across
the
picture
runs
a
cloistered
screen
separating
the
green
quadrangle
of

entrance
to
the
college
to

an
octangular
ogee
roof
protecting

beautiful
gates
to
the
right
of
this
is
the
grand
sweeping
entablature
of
the
camera
bearing
its
majestic
dome
and
lantern
this
dome
may
compare
with
some
of
the
finest
in
europe
the
time
is
inspires
mainly
a
desire
to
say
something
more
mirthful
and
less
thoughtful
and
for
those
who
care
for
none
of
these
things
what
sweeter
or
more
dignified
picture
of
quietness
and
study
is
there
than
at
lincoln
in
wesley
s
time
or
at
university
under
scott
or
christ
church
under
jackson
what
handsomer
than
the
camera
which
was
built
in
the
middle
of
that
century
or
better
to
live
in
than
fisher
s
buildings
at
balliol
or
what
inheritance
more
agreeable
than
the
old
so
happily
celebrated
in
the
sphÃ¦risterium
or
than
the
college
gardens
which
are
nearly
all
gifts
it
has
been
said
that
the
only
movement
in
the
eighteenth
century
was
a
very
slow
ascent
to
the
nineteenth
that
is
not
quite
so
as
many
will
agree
who
look
at
the
of
university
college
chapel
and
hall
which
was
done
when
the
wonderful
century
was
reached
at
length
in
fact
if
we
condemn
the
eighteenth
century
we
have
to
disown
a
large
part
of
the
nineteenth
in
oxford
that
is
especially
so
the
destruction
of
the
old
chapels
at
balliol
and
exeter
and
of
the
grove
at
merton
was
carried
out
only
fifty
years
ago
so
long
have
the
dark
ages
lingered
in
oxford
as
for
the
new
buildings
at

christ

merton
they
have
been
so
widely
condemned
that
it
is
to
be
presumed
there
is
some
merit
in
them
which
an
age
nearer
the
millennium
will
praise
but
those
works
are
only
the
less
admirable
and
more
conspicuous
emblems
of
the
reformation
it
had
at
length
become
possible
again
for
a
man
to
keep
his
terms
and
take
his
degree
without
continual
residence
within
college
walls
the
numbers
of
the
university
grew
rapidly
and
at
a
time
when
more
efficient
tutors
and
discipline
made
oxford
attractive
to
many
who
were
neither
frivolous
nor
rich
oxford
became
in
fact
a
place
of
education
the
previous
century
had
been
conspicuous
for
great
names
and
lack
of
system
what
was
achieved
was
due
to
individual
endowment
and
energy
and
the
able
men
stood
somewhat
apart
from
their
contemporaries
wesley
for
example
not
only
failed
to
make
a
strong
party
but
even
to
rouse
an
opposition
of
useful
size
the
nineteenth
century
on
the
other
hand
was
a
sociable
one
in
matters
of
intellect
there
were
few
lonely

there
were
many
groups
college

all

after
the

became
known
for
their
style
of
thought
more
than
for
their
noblemen

the
fault
of
monkishness
was
either
blotted
out
or
exchanged
for
one
that
is
more
commonly
pardoned
gaudens

at
first
this
meant
an
emphasis
upon
the
distinction
between
college

it
required
more

to
get
from
oriel
to

the
competition
engendered
by
the
new

schools
probably
increased
this
for
a
time
and
it
was
reported
of
one
head
that
when
told
that
worcester
college
was
above
his
own
in
a

he
turned
to
the

indeed
acquired
a

no
other
college
has
been
so

there
been

entire
rupture
with
the

anything
new

has
not
in

been
laid
reverently
upon
the
foundations
of
the

one
could
see

still

could
draw
him
quite
so
happily

in

he
gives
us
a
charming

quite
appropriately

allows

twice
a

from

gradually
dropped
into
a
tranquil
doze

sat
just

for

even
in

as
far
as

in
expectation
of
hearing
the

or
as
far
as
carfax
to
learn
whether
the

was
looking
any
older
he
was
exquisitely
courteous
without
a
tinge
of
mere
courtliness
and
could
hate
and
contemn
such
was
his
loathing
of
what
was
unseemly
that
he
begged
he
might
be
awakened
by
any
one
that
heard
him
snore
if
he
was
a
misogynist
it
was
because
he
was
shy
and
ignorant
of
women
he
would
gently
insinuate
and
as
if
it
were
temerity
that
even
good
women
can
not
distinguish
between

could
not
express
an
opinion
upon
subjects
which
he
ignored
or
disliked
and
when
they
were
discussed
in
the
common
room
he
had
an
irrepressible
sympathy
with
both
sides
thus
he
was
no
politician
but
was
at
one
with
members
of
parliament
of
both
sides
by
means
of
a
little
genial
commonplace
but
on
his
in
he
had
a
sweet
eloquence
which
he
hoped
was
not
for
he
disliked
proselytisers
more
than
proselytes
in
later
years
he
became
too
deaf
to
be
quite
honest
in
answering
a
stupid
or
knavish
man
he
had
too
a
little
vocal
impediment
which
he
could
use

was

was
despite
features
which
the
dull
might
call
plain
remarkably
and
i
had
almost
said
physically
beautiful
because
of
the
clear
shining
of
his
character
the
tender
motives
that
often
moulded
his
lips
the
purity
and
grace
that
found
expression
in
his
eyes
and
that
fluctuation
of
the
lines
of
the
face
in
thought
which
is
almost
light
and

wrought
an
immortal
beauty
out
of

endowment

was
that
only
when

fit
small
company
some

when
not

by
such
an
influence
lapse
into
that
sculptured
and
muddy
expression
which
is
the
chief
quality
of
photographs
you
may
surprise
them
void
and
waste
but
if
he
was
ever
surprised
it
might
be
seen
that
he
turned
to
the
intruder
fresh
from
a
spiritual
colloquy
his
smile
on
opening
plutarch
was
as
if
he
blessed
and
was
blessed
and
restored
the
beholder
to
the
age
of
the
first
revival
of
learning
very
soft
some
said
mincing
was
his
step
among
his
books
as
not
knowing
what
or
whom
he
might
disturb
if
you
saw
him
in
the
bodleian
he
seemed
its
familiar
spirit
and
in
some
way
its
outward
and
visible
expression
or
heraldic
device
though
a
wide
and
learned
reader
he
had
published
nothing
that
had
anything
to
do
with
books
in
his
youth
he
had
circulated
an
elegy
written
within
sight
of
keble
college
and
in
later
years
speculations
on
the
jurassic
sea
and
the
migration
of
birds
he
often
read
aloud
to
himself
and
even
to
others
on
being
provoked
in
his
sounding
wainscotted
room
in
sight
of
all
saints
steeple
especially
he
liked
to
chant
sophocles
and
to
the
opening
of
gave
a
solemn
and
almost
religious
sweetness
in
the
rendering
then
it
was
that
we
knew
how
he
had
gained
and
preserved
that
notable
grace
of
pronunciation
he
used
to
say
it
is
a
fine
day
instead
of
and
thus
of
every
day
he
made
a
rosary
of
gracious
thoughts
and
deeds
among
men
and
nature
and
books
and
apparelling
a
worldly
life
with
the
sanctity
of
unworldly
temperance
and
charity
his
homeliness
became
dignified
without
losing
its
simplicity
and
almost
ornate
with
courtesies
that
never
set
a
blush
in
the
face
of
truth
ii
of
the
successful
man
who
is
a
don
by
accident
i
confess
an
ignorance
that
borders
on
dislike
he
is
perhaps
a
scholar
certainly
a
courtier
he
has
the
open
secret
of
perennial
youth
it
is
very
likely
that
he
dabbles
in
light
literature
and
may
have
written
a
book
of
fiction
or
history
with
a
wide
circulation
he
was
a
gay
discursive
parodist
in
his
youth
chose
his
own
ties
or
thought
he
did
worked
hard
and
concealed
the
fact
from
his
inferiors
his
extreme
caution
might
appear
indiscreet
to
an
impartial
judge
he
writes
letters
to
the
on
important
matters
on
which
he
seeks
information
or
if
his
old
self
should
be
assertive
he
writes
over
the
name
of
justice
or
one
who
knows
in
a
penny
paper
and
is
indignant
towards
the
friends
who
fail
to
recognise
his
style
and
point
of
view
in
this
and
every
possible
way
he
keeps
a
firm
connection
with
the
great
outer
world
he
knows
the
female
cousins
of
all
the
undergraduates
of
his
college
and
many
of
them
have
been
mildly
in
love
with
him
in
a
punt
he
is
often
in
london
where
he
is
very
academic
and
would
wish
to
appear
merely
when
he
meets
london
friends
in
oxford
he
is
anxious
to
prove
that
he
at
least
is
not
a
mere
don
yet
his
friends
can
only
wonder
that
there
is
now
no
such
thing
as
an
oxford
point
of
view
but
only
an
oxford
drawl
his
is
magnificent
and
like
style
conceals
the
man
it
is
no
wonder
that
a
man
with
such
should
be
well
satisfied
his
books
are
noble
up
to
the
year
abundant
and
select
often
old
always
fine
but
after
the
year
a
certain
timidity
of
taste
may
be
observed
of
course
his
friends
books
are
there
with
the
books
which
you
are
expected
to
know
in
country
houses
for
the
rest
he
has
overcome
the
difficulty
of
selection
by
not
selecting
as
the
college
has
good
port
and
is
indifferent
in
its
choice
of
white
wine
so
he
has
good
classics
and
a
jumble
of
later
work
he
is
charitable
a
ready
contributor
to
approved
causes
he
has
travelled
and
is
never
reduced
to
silence
in
company
he
is
a
good
talker
knowing
how
not
to
offend
he
is
a
brilliant
host
suave
considerate
with
comprehensive
views
and
ready
to
make
allowances
for
those
who
are
not
dons
perhaps
he
is
in
the
main
a
summer
bird
then
he
shows
that
he
is
a
gallant
as
well
as
a
scholar
and
man
of
the
world
he
is
the
of
his
college
barge
during
the
eights
and
with
an
that
is
a
kind
of
sixth
sense
he
surveys
womankind
and
sees
that
it
is
good
iii
there
was
lately
also
a
more
roman
type
amongst
us
he
had
a
lusty
terentian
wit
that
was
not
in
the
fashion
of
these
times
and
his
proud
frankness
about
everything
but
his
soul
found
even
less
welcome
from
a
generation
that
liked
to
talk
of
little
else
a
little
hypocrisy
such
was
his
advice
to
freshmen
but
not
his
practice
a
little
hypocrisy
is
useful
to
a
virtuous
man
since
it
is
hard
not
to
appear
a
hypocrite
especially
when
one
is
he
was
what
is
called
an
intemperate
man
for
though
a
small
fastidious
eater
and
short
sleeper
he
was
a
man
of
many
bottles
nor
had
he
the
common
gift
of
repenting
of
the
truths
which
claret
inspired
and
port
enabled
him
to
express
he
never
learned
to
whine
over
private
infelicity
a
weighty
shortcoming
or
to
moralise
on
the
infelicities
of
others
which
was
almost
a
virtue
a
small
kantian
once
asked
him
how
he
felt
after
a
bereavement
it
has
never
occurred
to
me
was
his
reply
to
think
how
i
an
unsuccessful
man
himself
and
burdened
by
his
more
successful
and
more
indolent
relatives
his
catchword
was
nevertheless
but
he
perhaps
hated
more
than
a
noisy
failure
a
noisy
success
always
scheming
on
behalf
of
others
he
laid
no
plans
for
himself
except
by
writing
his
own
epitaph
on
the
day
before
his
death
he
ate
drank
was
merry
and
did
his
duty
he
was
the
life
and
soul
and
financial
saviour
of
his
college
at
no
time
was
he
a
profound
student
he
had
been
elected
to
a
fellowship
on
account
of
his
birth
yet
the
brilliant
scholar
and
the
nice
courtier
of
the
college
admitted
that
he
the
chapel
and
the
cook
were
equally
indispensable
in
fact
he
was
as
near
to
the
ideal
head
of
a
college
as
it
would
be
wise
to
have
in
an
ancient
university
he
could
not
lecture
and
was
a
poor
judge
of
imitation
greek
prose
he
radiated
a
clean
and
vigorous
worldly
influence
through
both
common
rooms
he
knew
every
undergraduate
who
was
within
the
reach
of
knowledge
his
judgment
of
men
was
as
consummate
and
as
untransferable
as
his
judgment
of
wine
it
was
his
custom
to
say
that
there
had
been
three
philosophers
two
ancient
one
modern
in
the
history
of
the
world
ecclesiastes
democritus
and
sir
william
temple
of
moor
park
to
his
pupils
he
used
to
pronounce
that
since
you
are
average
men
and
will
never
be
able
to
understand
ecclesiastes
or
take
the
trouble
to
understand
democritus
they
should
follow
the
englishman
he
then
repeated
from
memory
this
passage
with
such
solemnity
that
i
believe
he
felt
it
to
be
his
own
some
writers
in
casting
up
the
goods
most
desirable
in
life
have
given
them
this
rank
health
beauty
and
riches
of
the
first
i
find
no
dispute
but
to
the
two
others
much
may
be
said
for
beauty
is
a
good
that
makes
others
happy
rather
than
one
s
self
and
how
riches
should
claim
so
high
a
rank
i
can
not
tell
when
so
great
so
wise
and
so
good
a
part
of
mankind
have
in
all
ages
preferred
poverty
before
them
the
therapeutae
and
ebionites
among
the
jews
the
primitive
monks
and
modern
friars
among
christians
so
many
dervises
among
the
mahometans
the
brachmans
among
the
indians
and
all
the
ancient
philosophers
who
whatever
else
they
differed
in
agreed
in
this
of
despising
riches
and
at
best
esteeming
them
an
unnecessary
trouble
or
encumbrance
of
life
so
that
whether
they
are
to
be
reckoned
among
goods
or
evils
is
yet
left
in
doubt
when
i
was
young
and
in
some
idle
company
it
was
proposed
that
every
one
should
tell
what
their
three
wishes
should
be
if
they
were
sure
to
be
granted
some
were
very
pleasant
and
some
very
extravagant
mine
were
health
and
peace
and
fair
weather
which
though
out
of
the
way
among
young
men
yet
perhaps
might
pass
well
enough
among
old
they
are
all
of
a
strain
for
health
in
the
body
is
like
peace
in
the
state
and
serenity
in
the
air
the
sun
in
our
climate
at
least
has
something
so
reviving
that
a
fair
day
is
a
kind
of
sensual
pleasure
and
of
all
others
the
most
the
last
words
he
would
often
repeat
with
this
comment
that
people
were
so
much
busied
with
sunsets
and
landscapes
and
colours
that
they
had
no
such
hearty
feeling
for
nature
as
the
old
statesman
philosopher
and
gardener
had
read
cowley
and
pope
was
his
only
criticism
in
english
literature
any
one
can
be
a
keats
though
few
can
write
as
well
he
argued
but
it
is
not
so
easy
to
be
like
meeting
browning
one
day
and
telling
him
that
he
enjoyed
some
of
his
poetry
the
poet
asked
him
whether
he
understood
it
no
said
the
don
do
you
for
twenty
years
when
men
spoke
of
college
they
thought
of
him
the
university
of
oxford
said
an
old
pupil
who
lived
to
send
his
son
to
that
college
the
university
of
oxford
at
least
as
a
place
of
education
consists
of
old
the
river
and
the
college
that
college
is
now
like
roman
illustration
the
radcliffe
library
or
camera
bodleiana
from
brasenose

the
gateway
to
the

of
the
centre
of
the

is
the
entrance
to
the
college
from
the
square
in
which
stands
the
radcliffe
library
the
great
dome
of
the
library
rises
above
the
gateway
tower
dominating
the
square
the
college
and
indeed
all
oxford
on
the
extreme
right
is
the
entrance
to
the
hall
running
east
the
direction
in
which
we
are
looking
in
this
quadrangle
formerly
stood
a
metal
group
of
samson
slaying
the
lion
which
it
is
to
be
regretted
has
been
removed
it
served
to
give
scale
to
the
literature
without
lucretius
or
a
of
cold
water
when
i
look
back
and
see
him
more
military
than
ecclesiastical
except
for
a
snuffle
in
his
doctorial
scarlet
i
think
that
it
was
partly
his
brow
that
was
his
power
it
was
a
calm
ample
antique
brow
in
the
ancient
world
the
brow
made
the
man
and
the
god
it
was
as
divine
as
Ã¦gis
or
thunder
or
eagle
it
was
more
magisterial
than
the
fasces
it
commanded
the
consulate
and
troubled
the
dominion
of
persia
and
cast
down
the
power
of
hannibal
the
brow
of
jupiter
of
plato
of
augustus
was
a
hill
of
majesty
equal
with
olympus
the
history
of
old
sculpture
is
an
to
the
brow
now
the
soul
has
descended
to
the
eyes
in
politics
war
literature
above
all
in
finance
victory
is
with
the
eyes
the
old
man
had
the
godlike
span
of
curving
bone
but
his
eyes
slept
it
was
his
good
fortune
and
oxford
s
honour
that
he
ruled
an
oxford
college
iv
among
the
younger
men
is
one
who
spent
perhaps
a
year
in
trying
to
combine
high
living
and
high
thinking
then
made
a
compromise
by
dropping
the
high
thinking
and
at
last
perhaps
as
the
result
of
some
solemn
intervention
became
ascetic
he
is
a
friend
of
authors
and
potentates
he
understands
a
bishop
and
takes
a
kindly
interest
in
so
long
as
they
are
in
oxford
his
aspect
is
grave
and
calm
since
life
in
losing
half
its
vices
has
lost
all
its
charm
like
fine
cutlery
his
manners
lack
nothing
but
originality
he
has
a
good
taste
in
flowers
and
can
even
arrange
them
nor
is
the
taste
in
books
limited
by
his
connoisseurship
in
binding
he
is
a
free
and
fearless
reader
yet
careful
in
the
choice
of
books
to
be
left
on
the
table
if
style
were
finish
his
writing
would
be
famous
but
his
beautiful
style
is
always
subordinated
to
a
really
beautiful
handwriting
his
originally
dilettante
interest
in
palÃ¦ography
has
lured
him
into
some
genuine
research
among
old
manuscripts
his
lectures
are
therefore
fresh
thoughtful
and
perfect
in
gesture
delivery
and
composition
i
seem
to
behold
virgil
himself
at
the
end
of
one
of
his
descants
or
politian
at
least
if
he
had
not
more
love
of
the
applause
of
his
most
graceful
pupils
than
of
the
learned
world
he
might
be
renowned
but
he
is
content
to
be
of
a
specialist
in
history
and
more
than
one
of
the
arts
and
to
be
a
lodestar
to
the
ladies
of
his
audience
perhaps
only
they
can
do
him
justice
v
there
is
or
was
to
be
found
at
the
top
of
a
mouldy
oxford
staircase
the
most
unpedantic
man
in
the
world
seated
underneath
and
upon
and
amidst
innumerable
books
in
the
more
graceful
than
sufficient
garments
of
his
leisure
he
looked
like
homer
with
hair
still
ungrizzled
he
spoke
and
back
came
the
and
the
on
that
stormy
sound
but
he
could
so
well
dissemble
this
physical
magnificence
that
he
passed
in
illustration

and
a

he
loved
the
forest
and
cloud
and
sea
as
if
they
had
been
brothers
to
visit
him
in
his

to
go
with

and
genial
embodiment
of

and
a

of

his
room
was
alive
with
the
spirit
of
old
histories
famous
men
pericles
or
alexander
or
john
seemed
to
live
once
more
when
they
were
discoursed
of
in
that
eloquent
chamber
it
may
have
been
illusion
for
there
was
little
talk
of
historical
principles
but
on
leaving
him
a
man
felt
that
he
had
gone
away
before
the
mysteries
and
that
if
he
could
but
live
in
the
rooms
of
urbanus
the
past
would
be
wonderfully
revealed
then
a
day
or
two
afterwards
he
could
remember
only
urbanus
himself
and
after
a
brief
indignation
at
the
cheiromancy
quite
unwittingly
practised
admitted
that
that
was
sufficient
i
am
not
sure
whether
he
professed
history
or
divinity
or
chinese
he
wrote
however
an
treatise
on
the
literature
of
aboriginal
races
with
special
reference
to
sumatra
an
invaluable
brochure
on
the
jewellery
of
the
visigothic
kings
a
complete
exposition
of
the
ancient
game
of
tabblisk
and
a
brief
summary
of
the
loves
of
diarmad
o
his
sonnet
to
mallarmÃ©
though
it
has
been
described
as
is
justly
admired
but
he
did
not
write
ten
volumes
of
reminiscences
i
can
see
him
in
a
brown
library
or
a
pictured
hall
beginning
a
lecture
he
moves
about
a
little
uneasily
like
the
late
william
morris
and
as
if
he
would
rather
use
deeds
than
words
an
old
book
lies
open
before
him
now
and
then
he
turns
over
a
page
reads
to
himself
and
smiles
the
conscientious
undergraduate
looks
at
his
watch
and
begins
spoiling
his
pen
upon
the
he
comes
to
take
notes
but
urbanus
does
not
care
suddenly
the
lecturer
laughs
heartily
at
a
good
passage
and
begins
i
think
perhaps
you
will
like
this
story
and
he
reads
punctuating
the
matter
with
his
own
lively
appreciation
somerville

look

future
first
or
third
class
men
look
contemptuous
a
blue
feels
that
his
time
is
being
wasted
he
must
complain
he
rises
and
walks
out
as
urbanus
remarks
i
don
t
know
your
name
sir
but
you
can
sleep
if
you
urbanus
closes
the
book
five
minutes
before
or
after
the
appointed
hour
some
one
mutters
about
the
worst
lecturer
in
this
incubator
of
bad
lecturers
such
is
his
influence
not
so
much
injecting
knowledge
as
dredging
and
maturing
what
is
already
gained
that
others
can
think
of
him
easily
as
a
humanist
of
the
great
days
who
has
survived
in
his
old
college
with
an
indifference
to
mere
time
which
is
not
incredible
in
oxford
where
memories
three
centuries
old
are
still
alive
in
oral
tradition
vi
philip
amberley
late
fellow
of
took
it
much
to
heart
that
he
was
not
born
in
he
would
have
been
a
monk
and
would
have
illuminated
ovid
to
the
astonishment
of
all
ages
all
he
could
do
in
this
age
was
to
perform
his
tutorial
duty
and
to
write
a
few
pages
of
noble
english
in
a
caligraphy
that
was
worthy
of
the
ages
he
loved
he
wrote
but
one
book
which
he
burned
because
nobody
would
give
him
for
it
a
not
very
old
or
very
credible
story
tells
how
an
intelligent
alien
blurted
out
the
question
at
the
high
table
of
philip
s
college
whether
the
uncomely
heads
before
the
sheldonian
theatre
were
not
the
fellows
of
that
same
college
the
inquirer
was
corrected
with
asperity
and
in
revenge
he
always
stated
that
he
afterwards
received
photographs
of
the
younger
fellows
by
way
of
removing
the
mote
from
his
eye
but
philip
sent
a
photograph
of
the
least
human
physiognomy
signed
with
full
name
and
college
for
the
rest
he
had
that
uncertainty
of
character
which
is
called
conscience
in
the
good
and
timidity
in
the
bad
and
in
him
meant
merely
that
he
exchanged
an
act
for
a
dream
he
was
filled
with
a
supreme
pity
even
for
the
devil
whom
he
called
that
immortal
scapegoat
of
gods
and
he
died
on
an
evening
of
july
while
the
scent
of
hay
in
passing
waggons
filled
and
pleased
his
nostrils
lying
in
his
home
not
far
from
oxford
how
often
had
he
celebrated
the
sweetness
of
the
dead
grass
as
an
emblem
of
comely
human
death
for
a
little
while
he
spoke
of
his
friends
of
the
beautiful
gate
of
mary
s
of
his
columbines
the
older
sort
and
of
a
copy
of
virgil
newly
come
from
italy
we
listened
silently
life
was
still
an
eloquent
poet
on
his
lips
but
death
was
a
strong
sculptor
already
at
work
upon
his
face
and
hands
the
last
waggon
passed
below
his
window
as
he
lay
dead
and
the
friendly
carter
shouted
now
we
three
were
ashamed
that
we
could
find
no
tears
for
the
loss
of
such
a
man
and
again
that
we
should
suffer
any
alteration
of
our
joy
at
having
seen
what
we
had
seen
we
recalled
the
past
through
half
the
night
as
we
sat
none
of
us
looked
more
alive
than
he
amidst
the
old
gloomy
furniture
refashioned
by
the
moon
we
were
but
the
toys
of
night
of
the
smooth
perfumes
and
the
sounds
of
nothing
known
and
of
the
presence
which
was
like
a
great
thought
in
the
room
then
as
the
coming
day
mingled
with
the
passing
night
a
cold
pale
beam
á¿¶
ÏÎ¬Î¿Ï
á¼Î³Î½á½¸Î½
came
to
the
four
as
often
a
symbol
becomes
an
image
so
the
beam
of
light
seemed
to
be
the
very
spirit
of
which
it
was
a
messenger
hailed
by
our
eyes
and
hearts
it
was
beautiful
as
the
grail
with
many
angels
about
it
awful
as
the
woman
of
stern
aspect
and
burning
eyes
that
visited
the
dream
of
boethius
it
was
worthy
to
have
ushered
visions
yet
more
august
ah
the
awful
purity
of
the
dawn
the
light
grew
our
fancies
were
unbuilt
we
became
aware
of
a
holy
excellence
in
the
light
itself
and
enjoyed
an
almost
sensual
illustration
the
clarendon
building
looking
east
on
the
right
stand
those
grotesque
thermes
partly
surrounding
and
forming
an
entrance
to
the
enclosure
of
the
sheldonian
theatre
the
old
ashmolean
and
the
schools
they
are
a
quaint
and
conspicuous
feature
in
broad
street
above
them
towers
the
clarendon
building
with
its
worn
and
richly
coloured
surface
the
columns
of
the
portico
relieved
against
the
sky
a
portion
of
the
indian
museum
appears
in
the
centre
of
the
picture
the
old
houses
forming
picturesque
foreground
objects
to
the
melancholy
repose
the
owls
were
silent
the
nightingales
joined
their
songs
to
the
larks
and
i
went
out
and
walked
and
remembered
his
epitaph
dulcis
sed
dulcior
and
another
july
day
when
philip
amberley
was
alive
how
he
would
walk
with
what
an
air
an
effluence
humble
and
of
consequence
withal
half
the
village
dallied
among
their
flowers
or
beehives
to
see
him
going
his
long
staff
was
held
a
foot
from
the
upper
end
which
almost
entered
his
beard
he
bore
it
not
airily
with
twirling
and
fantastic
motion
as
our
younger
generation
likes
to
do
but
solemnly
making
it
work
and
leaning
on
it
as
if
it
were
a
sceptre
a
pillar
a
younger
brother
his
eyes
appeared
to
study
the
ground
yet
indeed
all
that
was
to
be
seen
and
much
that
is
commonly
invisible
lay
within
their
sway
it
was
said
he
kept
eyes
in
his
pockets
his
shanks
were
of
the
extreme
tenuity
that
seems
no
more
capable
of
weariness
than
of
being
diminished
returning
or
setting
forth
especially
when
seen
against
the
sky
at
sunset
or
dawn
he
was
a
portent
rather
than
a
man
his
person
was
an
emblem
of
human
warfaring
on
earth
a
hieroglyph
a
monument
his
movements
were
of
epic
significance
his
beard
did
not
merely
wag
it
transacted
great
matters
in
setting
out
he
himself
said
he
never
contemplated
return
it
was
unnecessary
at
most
it
was
one
of
several
possibilities
yet
had
he
a
big
laugh
that
came
from
his
beard
like
a
bell
from
a
grey
tower
he
would
even
sing
as
he
walked
and
was
the
sole
appreciator
of
his
own
rendering
of
the
all
souls
mallard
in
a
broken
grim
baritone
all
day
we
walked
along
an
ancient
oxfordshire
road
it
was
the
most
roundabout
and
kindly
way
towards
our
end
and
so
disguised
our
purpose
that
we
forgot
it
the
road
curved
not
merely
as
a
highway
does
demurring
nicely
distinguishing
between
good
and
better
rashly
advancing
straight
coyly
meandering
it
had
fallen
in
love
with
its
own
foibles
and
its
progress
was
not
to
be
measured
by
miles
at
one
loop
where
the
four
arms
of
a
battered
signpost
all
pointed
to
nowhere
the
first
man
who
trod
this
way
must
have
paused
to
think
or
not
to
think
and
have
lost
all
aim
save
perambulation
so
it
stole
through
the
land
without
arresting
the
domesticities
of
the
quiet
hills
often
it
was
not
shut
out
from
the
fields
by
hedge
or
fence
or
bank
for
some
leagues
it
became
a
footpath
its
second
childhood
as
though
a
rose
should
shut
and
be
a
bud
again
with
grass
and
flowers
unavoidable
under
foot
and
floating
briers
and
hops
overhead
in
places
the
hedges
had
united
and
unmade
the
road
from
every
part
of
it
some
church
could
be
seen
philip
would
sometimes
enter
in
having
some
faith
in
the
efficacy
of
reverence
offered
by
stealth
on
these
uncanonical
holy
days
on
our
way
he
sometimes
paused
where
bees
made
a
wise
hum
in
glowing
gardens
or
where
the
looked
like
groups
of
women
covered
by
their
yellow
hair
as
the
sun
ascended
or
where
the
eye
slumbered
and
yet
not
senselessly
or
in
vain
amidst
a
rich
undistinguished
landscape
made
unreal
and
remote
by
mist
and
he
would
whisper
an
oath
or
a
line
of
theocritus
or
a
speech
six
hundred
years
ago
perhaps
one
of
my
name
passed
along
this
road
oh
for
one
hour
of
his
joy
as
he
spied
his
inn
or
carved
a
cross
in
the
church
of
john
or
kissed
the
milkmaid
at
yonder
gateway
or
would
that
i
could
taste
his
grief
even
his
fresh
and
lively
grief
i
think
had
something
in
it
which
my
pale
soul
is
sick
for
for
me
the
present
is
made
of
the
future
and
the
past
but
he
perhaps
he
could
say
here
am
i
with
a
can
of
mead
and
a
fatigue
that
will
do
honour
to
my
lavendered
sheets
maria
here
s
to
you
all
yet
philip
s
mood
was
not
seldom
as
clear
and
simple
as
that
at
the
inn
a
classic
inn
to
oxford
scholars
while
the
wind
was
purring
in
a
yew
tree
he
put
all
his
gloomier
fancies
in
a
tankard
where
they
were
transmuted
by
a
lambent
ale
and
the
flaming
ramparts
of
that
small
world
the
landlord
was
unloading
a
dray
as
it
is
with
men
and
clothes
remarked
philip
so
with
ale
the
one
grace
of
new
ale
is
that
it
will
one
day
be
old
may
i
he
said
in
some
world
or
another
be
at
least
as
old
as
this
tankard
in
the
course
of
time
if
i
deserve
it
as
old
as
this
inn
if
i
can
as
old
as
these
hills
with
their
whiskers
of
yew
or
so
long
as
i
am
not
solitary
may
i
be
as
old
as
the
sun
which
alone
of
all
visible
things
has
obviously
reached
a
fine
old
age
he
told
me
that
his
only
valued
dream
was
of
an
immemorial
man
seated
on
a
star
near
the
zenith
and
his
beard
s
point
swept
the
hilltops
while
with
one
hand
he
raised
a
goblet
as
large
as
the
dome
of
the
radcliffe
to
his
lips
and
with
the
other
stroked
his
beard
and
caused
golden
coins
to
flow
in
cascades
into
the
countless
hands
of
those
underneath
and
in
a
melodious
bass
he
said
continually
it
is
in
his
youth
he
had
wedded
poverty
and
when
in
the
course
of
nature
she
forsook
him
he
gently
transferred
his
heart
to
humility
regretting
only
that
he
could
no
longer
dress
badly
or
make
his
own
toast
without
affectation
he
would
give
a
beggar
a
handful
of
tobacco
and
ask
sincerely
is
it
enough
at
the
inn
he
might
have
been
lightly
treated
for
the
respect
with
which
he
shamed
the
most
unhappy
outcast
if
he
had
not
indifferently
accepted
the
homage
of
the
squire
which
book
of
the
said
that
magnate
of
fifteen
stone
at
seeing
a
virgil
in
his
hand
do
you
like
best
the
and
why
because
i
have
just
read
it
over
and
which
do
you
like
next
the
second
because
i
read
it
first
and
loved
it
i
was
twelve
better
than
anything
but
so
he
turned
to
the
five
tramps
the
first
i
ever
saw
leave
their
hats
undoffed
at
his
approach
who
sat
opposite
they
spoke
proclaiming
themselves
human
but
their
clothes
their
twisted
bodies
and
their
gnarled
grey
bare
feet
seemed
to
be
the
original
material
from
which
some
power
had
adventured
to
carve
their
desperate
faces
and
then
desisted
in
alarm
lest
it
should
make
a
gnome
they
might
seem
to
have
newly
risen
out
of
the
soil
with
all
its
lugubrious
dishonours
about
them
and
in
an
elder
world
might
have
commanded
the
reverence
of
simple
men
as
chthonian
apparitions
i
have
seen
dead
like
them
and
rocks
out
of
which
the
sea
has
wrought
figures
more
humane
pedestalled
haply
in
a
palace
court
they
would
have
amazed
the
curious
and
confounded
the
wise
drinking
beer
at
the
pilgrim
s
chair
they
happened
to
agree
with
philip
s
idea
of
a
wild
man
which
he
had
treasured
on
a
dusty
platonic
shelf
of
his
mind
for
fifty
years
the
found
at
last
could
not
bring
a
finer
joy
to
a
botanist
than
they
to
him
his
mind
wandered
about
his
discovery
these
great
men
he
said
are
the
victims
of
a
community
that
permits
nobody
to
break
its
own
law
and
is
indignant
that
a
poacher
or
a
thief
should
claim
the
foregone
privilege
on
these
men
falls
the
duty
of
keeping
up
the
capacity
of
our
race
for
breaking
law
a
natural
capacity
i
should
like
to
see
fill
the
pot
landlord
something
like
the
american
established
in
this
fine
country
on
that
day
men
should
plant
not
a
tree
but
a
wild
emotion
not
all
of
us
alas
could
find
one
to
plant
but
such
a
wild
man
s
day
would
be
a
noble
opportunity
for
the
divine
instincts
that
are
now
relieved
or
by
politics
fiction
religious
reform
and
so
on
i
am
for
a
more
than
stuart
indulgent
government
on
one
day
when
the
policeman
should
clink
tankards
with
the
tramp
as
if
he
too
were
a
man
see
here
he
mildly
concluded
exposing
the
unwilling
palm
of
the
nearest
tramp
this
good
fellow
is
so
appreciative
that
he
has
taken
my
coppers
and
left
the
silver
in
my
ordering
the
landlord
to
fill
tankards
all
round
for
this
gentleman
he
said
pointing
to
the
pickpocket
he
soon
made
the
whole
party
harmonious
eloquent
and
gay
he
spoke
few
words
his
virgil
lay
open
still
now
and
then
his
random
speech
or
a
laugh
at
a
bad
jest
floated
joyously
like
lemons
in
a
over
the
company
every
one
astonished
every
one
with
shrewd
or
witty
things
not
a
man
but
thought
himself
almost
as
fine
a
fellow
as
philip
amberley
not
a
man
but
on
leaving
him
was
a
little
abashed
as
he
took
a
last
glance
at
my
friend
and
saw
what
manner
of
man
he
was
there
he
goes
said
philip
solemnly
as
he
leaned
forward
to
watch
them
reeling
up
the
lane
singing
as
if
their
feet
were
shod
and
their
pockets
full
there
he
goes
an
almost
perfect
man
i
seem
to
see
them
as
one
man
made
up
of
the
virtues
or
unselfish
vices
which
are
all
the
most
of
us
can
achieve
of
all
five
as
a
painter
collects
a
beautiful
face
from
many
mediocrities
every
one
of
them
has
his
fustian
soul
trimmed
with
curious
and
so
he
continued
with
generous
and
cunning
speech
freeing
of
rust
nay
illustration
all
saints
church
from
turl
street
all
saints
church
was
built
in
from
a
design
by
aldrich
dean
of
christ
church
the
tower
lantern
and
spire
which
appear
in
the
picture
are
well
proportioned
there
are
some
ancient
buildings
on
the
right
and
between
them
and
the
church
tower
at
the
south
end
of
turl
street
is
a
glimpse
of
the
high
street
north
of
the
nave
of
the
church
along
the
turl
shows
a
portion
of
the
buildings
of
lincoln
burnishing
the
unused
virtue
in
these
abjects
i
have
avoided
what
is
called
vice
he
said
because
it
is
so
easy
and
i
do
not
love
easy
things
and
for
the
same
reason
he
frowned
but
tenderly
on
those
who
had
not
avoided
it
while
the
sunlight
was
failing
we
were
left
by
ourselves
but
philip
was
not
alone
he
had
laid
his
book
and
ale
aside
and
looked
at
the
solemn
row
of
empty
chairs
against
the
wall
his
eyes
wore
the
creative
look
of
eyes
that
apprehend
more
than
is
visible
in
those
chairs
he
beheld
seated
what
he
called
his
loves
the
very
faces
and
hair
and
hands
of
his
dead
friends
i
have
heard
him
say
that
they
appeared
in
their
old
night
after
night
they
revisited
him
of
terrible
aspect
yet
sweet
and
desirable
they
were
as
saints
are
to
men
whose
religion
is
of
another
name
than
his
he
could
say
and
act
nothing
which
those
faces
approved
not
or
which
those
faint
hands
would
have
stayed
embroidered
by
the
day
upon
the
border
of
the
night
their
life
was
an
hour
out
of
doors
he
saw
them
too
in
places
gateways
above
hinksey
hilltops
at
cumnor
or
dorchester
christ
church
groves
or
fitting
oxford
streets
such
as
he
believed
had
something
in
them
which
they
owed
to
his
passionate
contemplation
in
their
midst
there
he
heard
them
speak
softlier
than
the
wings
of
fritillaries
in
bagley
wood
quis
amat
novit
quid
hÃ¦c
vox
but
his
own
face
comes
not
to
satisfy
the
longing
of
those
who
watch
as
faithfully
with
eyes
dimmer
or
of
less
felicity
the
past
the
oxford
graduate
of
the
past
is
far
too
pale
a
ghost
in
literature
he
lies
in
old
books
like
a
broken
sculpture
waiting
to
be
reconstructed
and
survives
but
in
an
anecdote
and
from
his
importance
after
leaving
oxford
for
a
bishopric
or
a
civil
place
for
one
memory
of
a
don
there
are
a
hundred
of
soldiers
statesmen
priests
in
the
quadrangles
and
streets
he
is
in
danger
of
being
treated
as
merely
the
writer
of
a
quaint
page
among
the
records
of
the
college
erasmus
fuller
wood
tom
warton
preserve
and
partly
reveal
the
spirit
of
the
past
and
help
us
to
call
up
something
of
the
lusty
vivid
life
which
the
fellows
and
canons
and
presidents
led
in
their
days
of
there
is
for
example
a
dean
of
christ
church
afterwards
bishop
of
oxford
and
last
of
norwich
who
has
still
the
breath
of
life
in
him
on
john
aubrey
s
page
i
he
was
very
facetious
and
a
good
fellow
and
ben
jonson
s
friend
when
a
master
of
arts
if
not
a
bachelor
of
divinity
he
was
often
merry
at
a
good
ale
parlour
in
friar
bacon
s
study
that
welcomed
pepys
and
stood
till
it
was
rumoured
that
the
building
would
fall
if
a
more
learned
man
than
bacon
entered
a
mischance
of
which
the
dean
had
no
fear
when
he
was
a
doctor
of
divinity
he
sang
ballads
at
the
cross
at
abingdon
on
a
the
usual
could
not
compete
with
such
a
rival
and
complained
that
he
sold
no
ballads
whereat
the
jolly
doctor
put
off
his
gown
and
put
on
the
s
leathern
jacket
and
being
a
handsome
man
and
had
a
rare
full
voice
he
had
a
great
audience
and
a
great
sale
of
sheets
his
conversation
was
extreme
he
and
stubbinge
a
corpulent
canon
of
christ
church
were
riding
in
a
dirty
lane
when
the
coach
was
overturned
dr
stubbinge
said
the
dean
was
up
to
his
elbows
in
mud
but
i
was
up
to
the
elbows
in
he
was
a
of
considerable
reputation
of
some
wit
and
abundant
mirth
with
a
quaint
looking
backward
upon
old
places
and
old
times
that
is
almost
pathetic
in
these
verses
farewell
rewards
and
fairies
good
housewives
now
may
say
for
now
foul
sluts
in
dairies
do
fare
as
well
as
they
and
though
they
sweep
their
hearths
no
less
than
maids
were
wont
to
do

who
of

finds
sixpence

lament

as
changelings
ever
since
for
love
of

when
bishop
of
oxford
he
had
an
admirable
grave
and
venerable
but
his
pontifical
state
permitted
some
humanities
and
he
was
married
to
a
pretty
wife
one
time
says
aubrey
as
he
was
confirming
the
country
people
pressing
in
to
see
the
ceremony
said
he
bear
off
there
or
i
ll
confirm
you
with
my
another
time
being
about
to
lay
his
hand
on
the
head
of
a
man
very
bald
he
turns
to
his
chaplain
lushington
and
said
some
dust
lushington
to
keep
his
hand
from
slipping
he
and
lushington
of
pembroke
college
a
very
learned
and
ingenious
man
would
sometimes
lock
themselves

he
laid
down
first
his
episcopal
hat
with
there
lies
the
doctor
next
his
gown
with
there
lies
the
bishop
and
then
twas

to

corbet

here

to
thee
three
years
after
attaining
the
bishopric
of
norwich
he
died
lushington
were
his
last
words
ii
there
is
also
in
aubrey
another
such
ruddy
memory
of
a
fine
old
gentleman
a
scholar
a
thoughtful
and
genial
governor
of
youth
a
right
church
of
england
man
and
president
of
trinity
in
gown
and
surplice
and
hood
he
had
a
terrible
gigantic
aspect
with
his
sharp
grey
eyes
and
snowy
hair
he
had
a
rich
digressive
mind
like
a
hasty
pudding
where
there
was
memory
judgment
and
fancy
all
stirred
together
not
suited
to
his
day
and
began
a
sermon
happily
but
not
at
all
to
aubrey
s
taste
being
my
turn
to
preach
in
this
place
i
went
into
illustration
trinity
college
the
entrance
to
the
college
is
under
the
tower
at
the
west
end
of
the
chapel
which
appears
towards
the
right
of
the
picture
the
architecture
of
the
chapel
is
worthy
of
being
seen
though
the
covering
of
green
prevents
this
a
custom
carried
to
excess
in
oxford
buildings
opposite
at
the
extreme
left
is
a
portion
of
the
east
end
of
the
chapel
of
balliol
college
and
the
trees
are
standing
in
that
remnant
of
an
old
orchard
fronting
the
broad
which
forms
the
spacious
approach
to
trinity
my
study
to
prepare
myself
for
my
sermon
and
i
took
down
a
book
that
had
blue
strings
and
looked
in
it
and
twas
sweet
saint
bernard
i
chanced
to
read
such
a
part
of
it
on
such
a
subject
which
has
made
me
to
choose
this
text
he
concluded
says
aubrey
but
now
i
see
it
is
time
for
me
to
shut
up
my
book
for
i
see
the
doctors
men
come
in
wiping
of
their
beards
from
the
he
could
from
the
pulpit
plainly
see
them
and
twas
their
custom
in
sermon
to
go
there
and
about
the
end
of
sermon
to
return
to
wait
on
their
undergraduates
who
pleased
him
not
were
warned
that
he
might
bring
an
two
hours
long
into
the
hall
he
was
inexorable
towards
wearers
of
long
hair
and
would
cut
it
off
with
the
knife
that
chips
the
bread
on
the
buttery
it
was
his
fashion
to
peep
through
in
order
to
find
out
idlers
says
one
he
scolded
the
best
in
latin
of
any
one
that
ever
he
it
seemed
to
him
good
discipline
to
keep
at
a
high
standard
the
beer
of
trinity
because
he
observed
that
the
houses
that
had
the
smallest
beer
had
most
drunkards
for
it
forced
them
to
go
into
the
town
to
comfort
their
yet
in
his
exhortations
to
a
temperate
life
he
admitted
that
the
men
of
his
college
ate
good
commons
and
drank
good
double
beer
and
that
will
get
and
he
was
a
man
of
tender
and
exquisite
charity
when
he
saw
that
a
diligent
scholar
was
also
poor
he
would
many
times
put
money
in
at
his
window
and
gave
work
in
transcription
to
servitors
who
wrote
a
good
hand
his
right
foot
dragged
somewhat
upon
the
ground
so
that
he
gave
warning
like
the
rattlesnake
of
his
coming
and
an
imitative
wag
of
the
college
would
go
so
like
him
that
sometimes
he
would
make
the
whole
chapel
rise
up
imagining
he
had
been
entering
the
civil
war
thinks
aubrey
killed
the
old
man
just
before
he
would
have
been
fifty
years
president
for
it
much
grieved
him
that
was
wont
to
be
so
absolute
in
the
college
to
be
affronted
and
disrespected
by
rude
the
cavaliers
and
their
ladies
invaded
the
college
grove
to
the
sound
of
lute
or
theorbo
some
of
the
gaudy
women
even
came
half
dressed
like
angels
to
morning
chapel
a
broke
the
president
s
so
he
gathered
his
old
russet
cloth
gown
about
him
and
closed
his
eyes
upon
the
calamity
and
died
still
a
fresh
and
handsome
old
man
iii
john
earle
a
notable
scholar
and
divine
of
the
seventeenth
century
a
fellow
of
merton
and
afterwards
bishop
of
worcester
and
bishop
of
salisbury
has
drawn
the
picture
of
a
downright
scholar
which
i
may
not
omit
earle
had
the
most
concentrated
style
of
any
man
of
his
time
each
of
his
sentences
is
a
document
his
characters
are
as
clear
and
firm
as
the
brasses
on
merton
altar
platform
and
likely
to
endure
as
long
a
downright
scholar
he
writes
is
one
that
has
illustration
interior
of
the
library
of
merton
college
the
newel
posts
balusters
and
of
the
staircase
leading
to
the
show
in
the
centre
of
the
picture
to
the
right
and
left
of
which
are
bookcases
and
the
quaint
jacobean
screens
peculiar
to
this
library
the
ribbed
barrel
roof
is
covered
with
timber
the
dormer
windows
which
light
the
library
appearing
on
the
left
over
the
staircase
an
old
oak
coffer
bound
with
iron
is
placed
to
the
left
of
the
much
learning
in
the
ore
unwrought
and
untried
which
time
and
experience
fashions
and
refines
he
is
good
metal
in
the
inside
though
rough
and
unsecured
without
and
therefore
hated
of
the
courtier
that
is
quite
contrary
the
time
has
got
the
vein
of
making
him
ridiculous
and
men
laugh
at
him
by
tradition
and
no
unlucky
absurdity
but
is
put
upon
his
profession
and
done
like
a
scholar
but
his
fault
is
only
this
that
his
mind
is
somewhat
much
taken
up
with
his
mind
and
his
thoughts
not
laden
with
any
carriage
besides
he
has
not
put
on
the
quaint
garb
of
the
age
which
is
now
become
a
man
s
total
he
has
not
humbled
his
meditations
to
the
industry
of
compliment
nor
afflicted
his
brain
in
an
elaborate
leg
his
body
is
not
set
upon
nice
pins
to
be
turning
and
flexible
for
every
motion
but
his
scrape
is
homely
and
his
nod
worse
he
can
not
kiss
his
hand
and
cry
madam
nor
talk
idly
enough
to
bear
her
company
his
smacking
of
a
gentlewoman
is
somewhat
too
savoury
and
he
mistakes
her
nose
for
her
lip
a
very
woodcock
would
puzzle
him
in
carving
and
he
wants
the
logic
of
a
capon
he
has
not
the
glib
faculty
of
gliding
over
a
tale
but
his
words
come
squeamishly
out
of
his
mouth
and
the
laughter
commonly
before
the
jest
he
names
this
word
college
too
often
and
his
discourse
beats
too
much
on
the
university
the
perplexity
of
mannerliness
will
not
let
him
feed
and
he
is
sharp
set
at
an
argument
when
he
should
cut
his
meat
he
is
discarded
for
a
gamester
at
all
games
but
one
and
thirty
and
at
tables
he
reaches
not
beyond
doublets
his
fingers
are
not
long
and
drawn
out
to
handle
a
fiddle
but
his
fist
is
clenched
with
the
habit
of
disputing
he
ascends
a
horse
somewhat
sinisterly
though
not
on
the
left
side
and
they
both
go
jogging
in
grief
together
he
is
exceedingly
censured
by
the
inns
of
court
men
for
that
heinous
vice
being
out
of
fashion
he
can
not
speak
to
a
dog
in
his
own
dialect
and
understands
greek
better
than
the
language
of
a
falconer
he
has
been
used
to
a
dark
room
and
dark
clothes
and
his
eyes
dazzle
at
a
satin
doublet
the
hermitage
of
his
study
makes
him
somewhat
uncouth
in
the
world
and
men
make
him
worse
by
staring
on
him
thus
he
is
silly
and
ridiculous
and
it
continues
with
him
for
some
quarter
of
a
year
out
of
the
university
but
practise
him
a
little
in
men
and
brush
him
over
with
good
company
and
he
shall
outbalance
those
glisterers
as
much
as
a
solid
substance
does
a
feather
or
gold
gold
one
story
is
told
of
him
he
was
and
much
beloved
his
servitor
was
endeared
to
his
faults
and
inquired
respectfully
one
day
why
his
master
had
not
boxed
his
ears
to
which
he
replied
that
he
thought
he
had
done
so
but
indeed
he
had
forgot
many
things
that
day
it
being
the
day
of
charles
s
execution
whereat
the
servitor
wept
and
received
the
admonition
unexpectedly
for
his
pains
undergraduates
of
the
present
and
the
past
chapter
iv
undergraduates
of
the
present
and
the
past
the
present
what
a
thing
it
is
to
be
an
undergraduate
of
the
university
of
oxford
next
to
being
a
great
poet
or
a
financier
there
is
nothing
so
absolute
open
to
a
man
for
several
years
he
is
the
nursling
of
a
great
tradition
in
a
fair
city
and
the
memory
of
it
is
above
his
chief
joy
his
follies
are
hallowed
his
successes
exalted
by
the
dispensation
of
the
place
surely
the
very
air
whispers
of
wisdom
and
the
beautiful
he
thinks
planius
et
melius
chrysippo
et
crantore
dicit
that
time
is
the
one
luxury
he
never
regrets
it
is
a
second
childhood
as
blithe
and
untroubled
as
the
first
and
with
this
advantage
over
the
first
that
it
is
not
only
good
but
he
knows
that
it
is
good
what
games
what
books
what
walks
what
affections
are
his
time
passes
we
say
although
it
is
we
like
children
that
see
the
square
fields
receding
from
their
swift
train
that
pass
yet
with
these
things
in
oxford
he
seems
to
lure
time
a
little
way
with
him
upon
the
road
the
liberty
of
a
man
and
the
license
of
a
child
are
his
together
of
course
he
abuses
them
he
uses
them
too
hence
the
admirable
independence
of
the
undergraduate
which
has
drawn
upon
him
the
excommunication
of
those
whose
concern
is
with
the
colour
and
cut
of
clothes
he
is
the
only
true
bohemian
because
he
can
not
help
it
does
not
try
to
be
and
does
not
know
it
he
is
the
true
democrat
and
condescension
is
far
less
common
than
servility
in
his
domain
he
alone
keeps
quite
inviolate
the
principle
of
freedom
of
speech
it
is
indeed
true
that
as
anywhere
else
fools
are
exclusive
as
regards
clever
men
and
different
kinds
of
fools
and
snobs
as
regards
all
but
themselves
but
theirs
is
a
rare
and
lonely
life
at
christ
church
they
have
actually
a
pool
in
the
centre
of
their
great
quadrangle
for
the
baptism
of
those
who
have
not
learned
these
fine
traditions
it
is
appropriately
called
after
mercury
to
whom
men
used
to
sacrifice
pigs
and
especially
lambs
and
young
goats
and
there
is
no
college
in
oxford
where
any
but
the
incompatible
are
kept
apart
and
few
where
that
distinction
is
really
preserved
as
befits
a
prince
in
his
own
palace
the
undergraduate
usually
dispenses
with
hypocrisy
and
secrecy
and
thus
gives
an
opportunity
to
the
imaginative
stranger
such
an
one
drew
a
lurid
picture
of
a
horde
of
wealthy
bacchanals
making
night
hideous
with
the
tormenting
of
a
poor
scholar
it
was
not
said
whether
the
sufferer
was
in
the
habit
of
doing
nasty
and
dishonourable
things
or
had
funked
at
football
or
worn
ringlets
over
his
collar
it
was
illustration
christ
church
college
tom
quadrangle
the
front
of
the
picture
is
occupied
by
part
of
the
basin
of
the
fountain
from
the
centre
of
which
rises
a
pedestal
bearing
a
figure
in
bronze
of
mercury
restored
in
reality
the
figure
no
longer
shows
above
the
in
the
basin
but
engravings
of
views
of
the
quadrangle
in
the
eighteenth
century
in
which
a
figure
of
mercury
appears
are
still
to
be
seen
and
the
fountain
was
once
called
the
the
entrance
gateway
to
the
college
and
a
portion
of
tom

appear
in
the
almost
certainly
one
of
the
remarkable
efforts
of
imagination
which
are
frequently
devoted
to
that
famous
city
and
its
inhabitants
the
patience
of
the
undergraduate
is
extreme
it
is
extended
to
tradesmen
and
to
the
sounds
of
the
salvation
army
he
greets
bimetallists
with
tenderness
teetotallers
with
awe
and
vegetarians
with
a
kind
of
rapture
tempered
by
a
rare
spurt
of
scientific
inquiry
if
he
makes
an
exception
against
sentimentalism
he
relents
in
favour
of
that
place
so
late
their
happy
seat
when
he
goes
down
belloc
has
put
that
retrospection
classically
the
wealth
of
youth
we
spent
it
well
and
decently
as
very
few
can
and
is
it
lost
i
can
not
tell
and
what
is
more
i
doubt
if
you
can
they
say
that
in
the
unchanging
place
where
all
we
loved
is
always
dear
we
meet
our
morning
face
to
face
and
find
at
last
our
twentieth
year
they
say
and
i
am
glad
they
say
it
is
so
and
it
may
be
so
it
may
be
just
the
other
way
i
can
not
tell
but
this
i
know
from
quiet
homes
and
first
beginning
out
to
the
undiscovered
ends
there
s
nothing
worth
the
wear
of
winning
but
laughter
and
the
love
of
friends
but
something
dwindles
oh
my
peers
and
something
cheats
the
heart
and
passes
and
tom
that
meant
to
shake
the
years
has
come
to
merely
rattling
glasses
and
he
the
father
of
the
flock
is
keeping
burmesans
in
order
an
exile
on
a
lonely
rock
that
overlooks
the
chinese
border
and
one
myself
i
mean
no
less
ah
will
posterity
believe
it
not
only
don
t
deserve
success
but
hasn
t
managed
to
achieve
it
not
even
this
peculiar
town
has
ever
fixed
a
friendship
firmer
but
one
is
married
one
s
gone
down
and
one
s
a
don
and
one
s
in
burmah
and
oh
the
days
the
days
the
days
when
all
the
four
were
off
together
the
infinite
deep
of
summer
haze
the
roaring
boast
of
autumn
weather
i
will
not
try
the
reach
again
i
will
not
set
my
sail
alone
to
moor
a
boat
bereft
of
men
at
yarnton
s
tiny
docks
of
stone
but
i
will
sit
beside
the
fire
and
put
my
hands
before
my
eyes
and
trace
to
fill
my
heart
s
desire
the
last
of
all
our
odysseys
the
quiet
evening
kept
the
tryst
beneath
an
open
sky
we
rode
and
mingled
with
a
wandering
mist
along
the
perfect
evenlode
i
the
average
man
seldom
gets
into
a
book
though
he
often
writes
one
yet
who
would
not
like
to
paint
him
or
have
him
painted
for
once
and
for
ever
and
who
would
not
wish
the
same
for
the
average
undergraduate
i
can
but
hint
at
his
glories
as
in
an
architect
s
elevation
for
he
is
neither
rich
nor
poor
neither
tall
nor
short
neither
of
aristocratic
birth
nor
ignobly
bred
briefly
providence
has
shielded
him
from
the
pain
and
madness
of
extremes
he
plays
football
cricket
rackets
hockey
golf
tennis
croquet
whist
poker
bridge
in
neither
will
he
excel
yet
in
some
one
he
will
for
an
hour
be
conspicuous
if
only
at
a
or
on
a
village
green
he
never
rashly
ventures
in
the
matter
of
dress
and
when
his
friends
who
are
above
the
average
are
wearing
very
green
tweeds
he
will
be
just
green
enough
to
be
passable
and
yet
so
subdued
as
not
to
be
questioned
by
those
who
stick
to
grey
he
is
never
punctual
on
the
other
hand
he
is
never
very
late
in
conversation
he
will
avoid
eloquence
for
fear
of
and
silence
for
fear
of
appearing
original
or
rude
at
most
he
will
be
frivolous
to
the
extent
of
remarking
about
a
pretty
face
oh
she
is
as
a
freshman
only
will
he
make
any
great
mistakes
thus
he
will
have
several
meerschaums
will
assemble
at
a
wine
party
the
most
incompatible
men
and
conclude
it
by
all
but
losing
his
and
will
for
a
term
use
oxford
slang
as
if
it
were
a
chosen
tongue
and
learn
a
few
witticisms
at
the
expense
of
shopkeepers
if
he
is
free
by
the
accident
of
birth
but
he
will
speedily
forget
these
things
and
become
a
person
with
blunt
and
tender
consideration
for
others
and
may
be
popular
because
of
his
excellent
cigarettes
or
his
ready
listening
he
will
in
a
few
years
learn
to
row
honestly
if
not
brilliantly
to
know
what
is
fitting
to
be
said
and
read
in
the
matter
of
books
to
discuss
the
theatre
the
government
the
cricket
season
in
an
inoffensive
way
add
to
this
pale
vision
the
colouring
implied
by
a
college
and
a
decent
ruddy
face
and
you
have
the
not
too
vigorous
or
listless
manly
man
with
modest
bearing
and
fearless
voice
who
plays
his
part
so
well
in
life
and
now
and
then
on
a
punt
or
at
a
wedding
reveals
to
the
discerning
observer
his
university
the
late
grant
allen
knew
him
by
his
broad
brown
back
and
his
habit
of
bathing
in
winter
in
a
rough
sea
ii
he
has
come
to
oxford
much
as
a
man
of
old
would
have
come
to
some
fabled
island
out
beyond
the
pillars
of
hercules
for
even
so
oxford
is
out
beyond
the
world
which
he
knows
the
graces
and
the
hours
thither
all
their
bounties
bring
perhaps
his
schoolmasters
have
been
oxford
men
but
that
has
not
disillusioned
him
he
has
been
in
the
habit
of
thinking
of
them
as
men
who
for
some
fault
or
misfortune
have
come
back
from
the
fortunate
islands
discontented
or
empty
they
have
not
known
how
to
use
the
place
he
knows
or
will
learn
to
know
and
he
dreams
of
it
in
his
peaceful
country
school
or
at
a
london
school
where
boys
go
as
to
a
place
of
business
and
make
verses
as
others
cast
accounts
to
some
oxford
men
matthew
arnold
s
thyrsis
is
the
finest
poem
that
was
ever
written
and
he
knows
it
by
heart
already
has
sighed
ignorantly
over
it
and
as
his
train
draws
near
to
oxford
he
repeats
it
to
himself
with
a
most
fantastic
fervour
as
if
it
were
half
a
prayer
and
half
a
and
certainly
more
than
half
his
own
the
pleasant
excited
uncertainty
as
to
whether
he
has
seen
the
fyfield
elm
or
whether
that
oaken
slope
was
cumnor
and
his
happy
surmises
while
his
eye
skips
from
tower
to
tower
in
the
distance
blind
him
to
the
drizzling
holiday
air
of
the
platform
he
has
no
time
to
remember
how
it
differs
from
eastbourne
he
is
so
set
upon
beholding
the
high
street
that
he
is
indifferent
to
the
tram
and
the
mean
streets
and
is
not
reminded
of
wandsworth
the
cabman
is
to
him
a
supernal
olympian
cabman
he
pays
the
man
heavily
and
quotes
from
sophocles
as
he
steps
through
the
lodge
gate
amid
the
greetings
of
porter
messenger
and
a
scout
or
two
the
magnificent
quadrangle
gives
a
dignity
to
his
walk
that
is
laughable
to
senior
men
he
goes
from
room
to
room
making
his
choice
and
knows
not
whether
to
be
attracted
by
the
spaciousness
of
one
suite
or
the
miniature
sufficiency
of
another
the
wainscot
of
a
third
the
traditions
of
a
fourth
or
the
view
from
a
fifth
in
the
evening
at
dinner
in
the
college
hall
he
puts
all
of
his
emotion
into
the
grace
before
meat
and
by
his
slow
loving
utterance
robs
the
fellows
of
their
chairs
and
the
undergraduates
of
their
talk
he
scans
curiously
the
healthy
or
clever
or
human
faces
of
his
contemporaries
at
the
table
as
all
visible
things
are
symbols
he
supposes
that
something
which
he
is
too
inexperienced
to
understand
distinguishes
these
youths
from
the
others
with
similar
faces
in
london
or
elsewhere
he
answers
a
few
questions
about
his
school
and
his
athletic
record
then
he
falls
back
upon
the
coats
of
arms
and
the
founders
portraits
on
the
walls
and
is
glad
when
he
has
returned
to
his
room
there
the
unpacking
and
arrangement
of
a
hundred
books
fill
the
hours
until
long
after
midnight
for
he
kneels
and
opens
and
reads
a
page
and
dreams
and
reopens
and
goes
to
the
window
to
listen
or
watch
not
a
book
but
he
finds
flat
and
uninspired
and
quite
unworthy
of
his
first
oxford
night
he
wants
something
more
megalophonous
than
de
quincey
more
perfect
than
pater
more
fantastic
than
browne
more
sweet
than
newman
something
that
shall
be
witty
spiritual
gay
and
solemn
in
a
breath
something
in
short
that
was
never
yet
written
by
pen
and
ink
although
often
inspired
by
a
night
like
this
the
eager
hours
and
unreluctant
years
as
on
a
mountain
stood
trampling
to
silence
their
loud
hopes
and
fears
darkening
each
other
with
their
multitude
and
cried
aloud
liberty
and
so
he
sleeps
but
in
spite
of
his
great
dreams
he
is
not
disappointed
when
he
looks
out
upon
the
glorious
company
of
the
spires
and
towers
of
oxford
he
rises
early
and
is
surprised
when
he
meets
only
the
college
cat
in
the
quadrangle
and
the
gate
is
shut
but
he
returns
quite
cheerfully
to
his
room
to
read
virgil
while
the
dreamy
sky
is
still
tender
with
the
parting
touch
of
night
after
breakfast
and
some
disbursements
to
porter
and
scout
he
begins
to
make
acquaintances
over
a
newspaper
in
the
junior
common
room
or
at
a
preliminary
visit
to
his
tutor
with
one
he
walks
up
and
down
high
street
he
learns
which
are
the
tailors
and
which
are
not
with
another
he
goes
out
to
parson
s
pleasure
and
likes
the
willows
of
mesopotamia
and
sees
new
college
tower
he
wants
to
loiter
in
the
churchyard
of
holy
cross
but
is
scornfully
reminded
that
byron
did
much
the
same
queen
s
college
inspires
his
companion
with
the
remark
that
queen
in
oxford
is
called
the
martyr
s
memorial
calls
forth
maggers
memugger
worcester
wuggins
jesus
jaggers
and
he
is
much
derided
when
he
supposes
that
the
scouts
use
these
terms
after
luncheon
he
can
not
get
free
but
must
watch
football
or
the
humours
of
tubbing
on
the
river
his
companions
with
all
the
easy
omniscience
of
boys
are
so
busy
telling
him
what
s
what
that
he
learns
little
of
what
is
and
at
tea
he
is
as
wise
as
they
and
has
the
tired
emotion
of
one
who
has
been
through
fairyland
on
a
motor
car
a
week
in
this
style
broadens
his
horizon
his
optimism
still
strong
embraces
mankind
and
excludes
most
men
a
series
of
teas
with
senior
men
and
a
crowd
of
contemporaries
fails
to
exhilarate
him
the
shy
are
silent
the
rest
talk
about
their
schools
appear
advanced
men
of
the
world
and
shock
their
seniors
who
in
their
turn
dispense
tales
about
dons
and
useful
information
and
he
feels
ashamed
to
be
silent
and
contemptuous
of
what
is
said
his
grace
in
hall
has
become
so
portentous
that
his
neighbour
hums
the
dead
march
in
by
way
of
accompaniment
with
some
misgiving
he
goes
alone
to
his
room
sports
his
oak
which
others
so
often
do
for
him
when
he
is
out
and
puts
his
room
in
order
his
college
shield
brilliantly
and
incorrectly
blazoned
hangs
above
the
door
photographs
of
his
newest
acquaintances
rest
for
the
time
upon
his
desk
he
has
not
yet
learned
to
respect
the
photograph
of
a
botticelli
above
the
mantelpiece
and
has
tucked
under
its
frame
a
caricature
of
some
college
worthy
with
notes
of
invitation
a
table
of
work
and
his
first
on
the
mantelpiece
are
photographs
that
recall
tenderer
things
along
with
his
meerschaum
and
briar
for
a
minute
he
is
interrupted
by
a
kick
an
undeniable
shout
a
cigar
and
behind
it
the
captain
of
rugby
football
can
you
play
says
the
captain
i
have
never
tried
says
the
freshman
modestly
the
captain
retires
after
conferring
an
indignity
in
pert
monosyllables
and
familiarly
inquiring
after
all
your
how
do
you
know
i
have
any
aunts
he
inquires
oh
replies
the
captain
i
never
heard
of
a
illustration
holywell
church
holywell
is
the
campo
santo
of
oxford
and
many
names
famous
in
her
history
are
found
there
the
almost
ruined
cottage
and
desolate
garden
make
a
suitable
foreground
the
view
is
from
the
nephew
without
an
aunt
and
i
am
sure
you
couldn
t
do
without
i
wonder
why
he
came
to
oxford
reflects
the
freshman
he
s
mistaken
his
calling
chuckles
the
other
on
the
way
downstairs
the
freshman
lights
his
meerschaum
holding
it
in
a
silk
handkerchief
and
begins
to
make
a
plan
for
three
or
four
years
but
he
never
completes
it
he
believes
oxford
to
be
as
a
fine
sculptor
and
wishes
to
put
himself
in
its
hands
in
such
a
way
as
to
be
best
shapen
by
the
experience
in
a
wise
he
wants
to
be
a
scholar
and
fears
to
be
a
pedant
he
wants
to
learn
a
wise
and
graceful
habit
with
his
and
fears
to
be
what
he
hears
called
a
gentleman
he
wants
to
test
his
enthusiasm
and
prejudices
and
fears
to
be
a
philistine
he
wants
to
taste
pleasure
delicately
and
fears
to
be
a
or
an
Ã¦sthete
none
of
these
aims
is
altogether
conscious
or
precise
yet
it
is
some
such
combination
that
he
sees
before
him
faint
and
possible
at
the
end
of
three
or
four
years
nor
has
he
any
aim
beyond
that
he
will
work
but
at
what
neither
has
he
realised
that
he
will
be
alone
and
unhelped
at
first
the
loneliness
is
a
great
and
even
at
times
a
delirious
pleasure
and
whether
he
is
in
a
church
or
in
the
fields
or
among
books
it
is
almost
sensual
and
never
critical
oxford
is
as
it
were
doing
his
living
for
him
he
is
as
powerless
to
influence
the
passage
of
his
days
as
to
plan
the
architecture
of
his
dreams
he
only
awakens
at
his
meals
with
contemporaries
and
sometimes
at
interviews
with
tutors
the
former
find
him
dull
and
superior
the
latter
tell
him
that
in
his
work
he
is
indeed
gathering
honey
but
filling
no
combs
and
find
him
ungainly
and
vague
he
consoles
himself
with
the
reflection
that
he
is
not
becoming
a
pedant
or
a
careless
liver
he
writes
verses
to
celebrate
the
melodious
days
he
lives
all
influences
of
men
fall
idly
upon
him
they
on
us
were
rolled
but
kept
us
not
awake
the
digressive
habit
of
mind
not
only
grows
upon
him
he
cultivates
it
his
tutor
says
that
it
is
impossible
to
give
a
title
to
his
best
essays
long
lonely
evenings
with
books
only
encourage
the
habit
but
he
can
defend
it
and
laughs
at
criticism
shakespeare
s
dramas
he
says
flow
through
the
centuries
like
the
nile
his
flood
is
not
so
vast
that
it
may
not
be
aggrandised
by
many
a
tributary
it
has
come
down
to
us
vaster
than
when
it
reached
milton
or
gray
not
only
by
definite
commentary
but
by
the
shy
emotions
of
a
myriad
readers
we
add
to
it
he
says
triumphantly
by
our
digressions
and
what
revelation
it
may
make
in
consequence
to
a
far
future
generation
we
can
not
guess
in
his
pursuit
of
words
which
soon
enthrall
him
he
goes
far
rather
than
deep
wherever
the
word
has
been
cherished
for
its
own
sake
in
all
decadent
literature
he
makes
his
mind
a
home
he
begins
to
write
but
in
a
style
which
along
with
his
ornate
penmanship
would
occupy
a
lifetime
and
result
in
one
or
half
a
dozen
sonnets
it
is
a
kind
of
higher
philately
but
it
takes
him
to
strange
and
fascinating
byways
in
literature
he
loves
the
grotesque
now
and
then
he
lets
fall
a
quotation
or
even
a
dissertation
on
such
a
book
at
dinner
and
suddenly
he
is
launched
into
popularity
first
he
is
hailed
as
a
decadent
and
shrinks
when
the
shrinking
is
over
he
secretly
falls
in
love
with
the
title
and
seeks
others
who
accept
it
now
he
is
never
by
himself
those
with
whom
he
has
no
sympathies
like
him
because
he
happens
to
know
and
a
few
books
such
as
some
undergraduates
keep
between
false
covers
his
room
is
fragrant
with
unseasonable
flowers
with
the
perfume
of
burning
juniper
burning
cassia
and
cedar
and
sweet
oils
what
if
the
honourable
ghosts
of
oxford
frown
upon
his
strange
devotions
he
is
at
least
living
a
life
that
could
not
persist
elsewhere
at
chapel
he
is
reading
theophrastus
he
is
studying
an
undercurrent
of
the
italian
renaissance
at
a
lecture
on
thucydides
as
if
he
were
to
live
for
ever
and
in
oxford
his
existence
is
such
that
his
stay
in
oxford
or
in
life
becomes
precarious
he
is
reputed
to
be
a
connoisseur
in
wines
pictures
and
furniture
he
is
a
roman
catholic
by
profession
an
agnostic
by
conviction
yet
no
religion
or
superstition
is
quite
safe
from
his
patronage
he
mistakes
the
recrudescence
of
childishness
for
a
sad
and
wise
maturity
freshmen
are
struck
by
his
listless
gaiety
and
the
unkind
and
seeming
wise
solemnity
of
his
light
expressions
if
to
sit
sumptuous
and
still
to
discourse
melodiously
of
everything
or
nothing
to
be
courteous
sentimental
cold
and
rude
in
turns
were
wisdom
he
is
wise
he
acquires
the
lofty
cynicism
of
the
and
the
he
can
talk
with
ease
and
point
about
the
merely
married
don
about
virtue
as
the
fine
which
the
timid
pay
to
the
bold
about
the
dulness
of
enthusiasm
and
the
strange
beauty
of
grey
at
what
is
temperate
and
modest
he
throws
satire
with
a
bitterness
enhanced
by
a
secret
affection
for
what
he
lapidates
like
a
man
who
should
paint
an
angel
and
call
it
a
thief
he
narrowly
pursues
his
own
choicest
veiled
gifts
with
a
malicious
word
in
short
his
brilliant
conversation
proves
how
much
easier
it
is
to
think
what
one
says
than
to
say
what
one
thinks
yet
is
he
now
a
harder
student
than
he
has
ever
been
and
allows
nothing
to
disturb
him
at
his
books
he
has
nodded
at
european
literatures
through
half
their
courses
in
the
lonely
hours
when
his
companions
are
asleep
he
is
planning
again
and
realises
that
it
would
be
a
showy
thing
to
get
a
first
class
his
conversation
becomes
gloomy
as
well
as
bitter
people
suspect
that
he
means
what
he
says
and
he
mutters
in
explanation
that
experience
is
the
basis
of
life
and
the
ruin
of
philosophies
his
friends
simply
accept
the
remark
as
untrue
he
is
now
often
reduced
to
silence
among
those
who
sleep
well
he
no
longer
pours
a
current
of
fresh
and
illuminating
thought
upon
things
which
he
not
only
does
not
understand
but
does
not
care
for
in
politics
or
art
he
slips
out
of
brilliant
company
to
enter
occasionally
among
religious
circles
where
they
are
tolerant
of
lost
sheep
and
has
begun
to
pay
his
smaller
bills
and
to
find
out
what
books
he
must
read
for
a
degree
when
the
examination
day
arrives
then
he
borrows
his
old
dignified
look
of
indolence
in
the
sultry
schools
while
he
writes
hard
and
secures
a
second
class
by
means
of
a
legible
handwriting
clear
style
and
amusing
irrelevance
he
goes
down
alone
still
with
a
fascinating
tongue
desperate
and
yet
careless
of
success
ready
to
do
anything
so
long
as
he
can
escape
comfortable
and
conventional
persons
and
quite
unable
to
be
anything
conspicuous
but
a
man
who
has
been
to
the
garden
of
the
hesperides
and
brought
back
apples
that
he
alone
can
make
appear
to
be
golden
in
his
rare
moments
of
health
iii
he
is
one
who
knows
that
three
or
four
years
at
the
university
is
a
good
investment
he
comes
up
with
an
open
scorn
of
idlers
both
gilded
and
gifted
whether
he
is
clever
and
successful
or
not
he
has
a
suspicion
that
dons
are
underworked
colleges
expensive
hotels
or
worse
and
is
determined
to
change
all
that
not
infrequently
such
a
one
is
perverted
by
a
happy
evening
with
a
few
acquaintances
early
in
his
first
term
if
he
is
not
he
is
a
white
elephant
the
dons
are
alarmed
by
his
instructions
the
undergraduates
by
his
clothes
if
this
were
not
an
old
conservative
creek
he
seems
to
say
promotion
would
go
by
merit
and
i
should
soon
be
at
the
top
of
the
tree
and
begin
but
the
university
remains
unchanged
he
looks
about
him
for
a
more
stealthy
passage
to
his
ends
a
vernal
impulse
it
may
be
sends
him
to
a
tailor
s
shop
and
in
the
unwonted
resplendence
that
follows
he
is
almost
a
butterfly
in
a
jocular
spirit
he
calls
upon
the
persons
whose
invitations
he
used
to
ignore
if
he
is
clever
or
amusing
or
apparently
labouring
under
a
delusion
he
is
liked
in
his
turn
he
is
called
upon
he
begins
to
find
that
there
is
something
in
himself
which
has
a
taste
for
all
that
is
human
he
mutters
with
one
of
the
classical
quotations
which
are
to
his
taste
he
will
dally
with
the
multitude
for
an
hour
or
two
a
week
why
not
for
a
term
when
he
is
in
the
company
of
the
sons
of
old
or
wealthy
families
it
occurs
to
him
that
rank
and
wealth
are
powerful
it
follows
and
can
be
demonstrated
that
the
power
can
not
be
more
justly
exercised
than
in
the
furthering
of
honest
and
meritorious
poverty
he
will
make
a
concession
possibly
another
visit
to
a
tailor
perhaps
a
little
champagne
several
discoveries
follow
it
would
be
not
only
difficult
but
contemptible
to
play
football
or
to
row
yet
he
can
learn
to
play
lawn
tennis
he
is
presently
quite
at
home
if
not
in
love
at
garden
parties
he
mistakes
the
curious
interest
of
men
and
women
in
one
who
is
entirely
different
from
themselves
for
a
compliment
to
his
adaptability
society
bores
him
rapidly
he
has
had
enough
of
vacation
visits
and
picnics
during
the
term
and
revives
his
acquaintance
with
work
and
the
indolent
fellows
but
that
is
not
necessarily
attractive
also
his
friends
and
admirers
will
not
let
him
disappear
and
he
returns
to
frivolity
in
a
serious
and
plotting
spirit
he
tolerates
nearly
every
one
and
in
particular
the
influential
they
cultivate
him
clearly
for
his
intelligence
his
independence
his
originality
why
should
he
not
cultivate
them
for
their
own
petty
endowment
he
enters
office
at
the
union
he
is
elected
to
presidentships
secretaryships
he
is
lucky
if
he
does
not
learn
from
others
what
he
will
not
easily
learn
alone
that
his
resemblance
to
them
is
neither
his
best
nor
his
most
useful
quality
and
so
he
finds
that
after
all
there
is
nothing
in
ideals
and
steps
into
a
comfortable
place
in
life
or
perhaps
he
does
not
iv
the
undergraduate
looks
as
if
he
had
been
designed
by
the
architect
of
the
five
orders
gate
in
the
schools
quadrangle
his
hat
his
face
his
tie
his
waistcoat
his
boots
represent
the
five
orders
as
in
his
great
original
the
corinthian
is
predominant
and
like
that
he
would
never
be
thought
possible
if
he
had
not
been
seen
yet
he
moves
despite
his
elaborate
appearance
destined
to
endure
perhaps
for
all
time
or
as
long
as
a
it
is
impossible
to
guess
what
may
be
his
activities
he
may
be
a
famous
oarsman
or
cricketer
in
which
case
his
taste
forbids
him
to
adopt
the
broad
blue
band
of
his
rank
unless
there
are
ladies
in
oxford
he
may
be
a
student
who
adopts
this
among
many
methods
of
showing
that
his
successes
fall
to
him
as
naturally
as
saturday
and
sunday
he
may
be
an
amateur
tragedian
or
or
Ã¦sthete
who
finds
the
costume
less
embarrassing
although
less
distinguishing
than
cosmetics
and
an
overcoat
of
fur
he
may
be
a
who
has
chosen
this
contrasted
barry
wavy
set
of
colours
as
his
coat
of
arms
or
the
perambulating
d
of
several

he
may
be
a
blood
of
many
great
connections
and
expenses
genial
in
his
sphere
pleased
with
the
number
of
his
debts
and
the
times
he
has
been
ploughed
in
smalls
hunting
or
rowing
keenly
while
he
lasts
and
except
when
he
has
to
work
which
sends
him
to
sleep
a
sitter
up
at
nights
over
cards
and
wine

and
sour
severity
with
their
grave
saws
in

lie
we
that
are
of
purer
fire
imitate
the
starry
quire
or
his
great
expenses
and
connections
may
not
exist
he
is
perhaps
a
poor
and
worthless
imitation
of
all
that
is
great
who
does
not
know
lord
of
whom
he
tells
such
dull
stories
whose
relatives
are
neither
retired
nor
in
army
navy
or
church
and
entirely
respectable
in
the
vacations
when
he
earns
by
his
own
what
was
earned
for
his
models
by
the
illustration
the
bathing
sheds
or
parsons
pleasure
these
sheds
are
built
on
the
banks
of
the
river
cherwell
the
willow
trees
lining
the
stream
being
fitted
with
platforms
at
all
heights
for

the

is
near
sunset
in
summer
unscrupulousness
of
their
ancestors
in
short
he
may
be
a
most
brilliant
most
fascinating
or
most
modest
person
who
has
chosen
to
appear
piebald
his
room
is
decorated
with
photographs
of
actresses
along
with
perhaps
a
hogarth
print
a
florid
male
and
a
floral
female
portrait
an
expensive
picture
of
a
horse
and
copies
from
leighton
in
a
corner
is
a
piano
which
he
is
perhaps
eager
and
unable
to
play
the
air
is
scented
with
roses
and
cigarettes
the
is
strewn
with
bills
a
caricature
of
himself
from
an
undergraduate
paper
several
novels
and
boxes
of
cigarettes
a
history
of
the
of
bigpott
and
under
a
cushion
some
and
a
table
of
work
he
is
to
be
met
with
everywhere
for
he
is
not
ashamed
to
be
seen
he
lives
long
in
the
memories
of
travellers
from
birmingham
who
wait
five
minutes
in
oxford
in
the
schools
he
is
a
constant
attendant
always
sanguine
not
quite
cheerful
or
satisfied
with
the
company
yet
equal
at
his
viva
voce
to
a
look
of
ineffectual
superiority
for
the
man
who
ploughs
him
with
a
smile
he
is
also
to
be
found
by
the
river
during
the
eights
when
he
cheers
and
looks
very
well
in
a
bookshop
where
he
recognises
omar
and
some
novels
or
in
the
high
which
never
wearies
him
although
his
bored
look
seems
to
say
so
v
he
has
come
up
with
a
scholarship
from
school
there
he
took
prizes
had
an
attack
of
and
edited
the
magazine
and
he
has
come
to
the
university
as
if
it
were
an
upper
class
of
his
old
school
his
aim
is
as
many
prizes
as
possible
and
a
good
degree
the
tutors
here
like
the
masters
at
school
he
regards
as
men
who
turn
a
handle
and
work
up
more
or
less
good
material
into
scholars
as
a
butcher
makes
sausages
all
exactly
alike
to
the
eye
out
of
a
mysterious
heap
at
first
he
is
in
great
awe
of
a
fellow
and
wears
his
scholar
s
gown
at
its
utmost
length
and
as
proudly
as
star
and
riband
he
will
hardly
take
it
off
in
the
severe
quarter
of
an
hour
in
which
he
permits
himself
to
drink
coffee
and
eat
anchovy
toast
after
dinner
and
he
sometimes
pretends
to
forget
that
he
has
it
on
until
he
goes
to
bed
perhaps
on
one
occasion
he
trips
his
tutor
over
a
quotation
or
something
of
no
account
he
scans
the
tutor
s
bookshelves
and
finds
odd
things
between
tacitus
and
thucydides
which
make
him
ponder
at
length
he
is
less
respectful
opens
discussions
in
which
having
tired
the
tutor
he
returns
very
well
satisfied
for
he
has
a
patent
memory
as
he
has
a
patent
and
nothing
goes
into
it
without
a
bright
label
as
nothing
goes
into
his
without
honours
of
pencilled
red
and
blue
his
copy
of
homer
is
so
overscored
that
one
might
suppose
that
the
battle
of
the
pigmies
and
cranes
had
been
fought
to
a
sanguinary
end
upon
its
page
at
school
his
football
was
treated
with
contempt
yet
with
silence
except
by
very
small
boys
at
college
he
is
anxious
to
do
a
little
at
games
the
captain
of
the
boats
asks
him
as
a
matter
of
course
to
go
down
to
the
river
to
be
tubbed
or
coached
in
a
boat
and
he
replies
that
he
will
willingly
spare
half
an
he
shows
some
good
points
at
the
river
is
painstaking
and
neat
his
is
mercilessly
multiplied
day
after
day
he
is
to
be
found
at
the
in
february
in
his
college
torpid
and
proves
a
stately
nonentity
or
passenger
discovers
that
rowing
abrades
more
than
his
skin
and
gives
it
up
just
before
he
is
asked
to
for
the
future
he
sculls
alone
once
a
week
when
it
is
mild
and
oftener
when
his
friends
are
visiting
him
which
he
does
not
encourage
at
such
times
he
learns
that
it
is
quite
true
that
oxford
possesses
some
fine
drawings
marbles
stained
glass
and
a
library
of
little
use
to
a
determined
greats
man
these
he
exhibits
to
the
visitors
impatiently
and
with
pride
he
returns
to
his
work
unruffled
already
he
has
scored
one
first
class
and
a
for
a
prize
yet
his
tutor
pays
him
qualified
compliments
which
he
attributes
to
the
natural
bitterness
of
a
second
class
man
the
tutor
sometimes
asks
him
what
he
reads
to
which
he
replies
brightly
with
a
long
list
of
texts
etc
yes
but
what
do
you
read
when
you
unbend
says
the
tutor
did
you
ever
read
with
a
touch
of
exasperation
the
youth
blushingly
replies
no
i
never
nor
is
the
other
far
more
pleased
when
he
brings
with
him
on
a
short
vacation
boating
holiday
a
volume
of
the
now
and
then
he
speaks
at
the
union
there
and
at
afternoon
teas
with
ladies
he
is
known
for
the
lucidity
of
his
commonplaces
and
the
length
of
his
quotations
for
the
most
part
he
talks
only
of
his
work
and
the
current
number
of
the
his
work
meantime
is
less
and
less
satisfactory
to
every
one
but
his
coach
some
say
that
he
will
get
another
first
and
will
not
deserve
it
already
he
is
learning
that
three
or
four
years
among
boys
is
not
helpful
to
his
future
no
one
so
much
as
he
emphasises
the
distinction
between
third
and
second
year
undergraduates
he
is
always
looking
for
really
improving
conversation
and
play
of
mind
without
any
play
a
book
tea
would
please
him
if
it
were
not
so
frivolous
once
only
he
lapses
from
the
rigidity
of
his
ways
he
thinks
it
a
matter
of
duty
until
it
occurs
when
the
hearty
and
informal
reception
given
to
his
rendering
of
to
anthea
discourages
any
further
condescension
with
that
exception
he
moves
with
considerable
dignity
among
mankind
in
all
things
discreet
with
a
leaning
towards
the
absurd
in
most
things
well
under
control
yet
in
spite
of
his
rigidity
really
luxuriating
in
the
sweets
of
a
neutral
nature
that
never
tempts
temptation
he
sends
in
a
neat
flowery
and
icy
poem
for
the
newdigate
prize
and
wins
he
gets
his
second
first
class
and
an
appointment
which
he
likes
at
the
same
time
he
enters
for
a
fellowship
and
his
failure
calls
forth
the
old
story
about
the
cherry
tart
that
was
offered
to
likely
competitors
at
a
fellowship
examination
where
the
cleanest
management
of
the
stones
meant
success
he
goes
down
with
his
degree
and
confident
applauded
unmissed
his
friends
say
that
he
lacks
something
which
he
ought
to
have
what
is
it
vi
he
has
come
up
to
oxford
with
an
unconquerable
love
of
men
and
books
and
games
is
resolved
not
to
be
careful
in
small
matters
for
a
few
years
and
has
a
clear
vision
of
a
profession
ahead
others
think
that
a
fellowship
and
a
prize
are
his
due
he
vaguely
regards
them
as
nice
but
he
has
a
strong
belief
that
any
kind
of
distinction
is
dangerous
at
oxford
and
among
the
least
of
its
possibilities
he
respects
the
scholar
and
the
blue
and
sees
that
they
might
equally
well
be
made
in
another
city
or
on
another
stream
bent
upon
a
life
among
men
he
sees
that
a
university
is
a
place
where
many
are
men
but
where
many
of
the
suspicious
and
calculating
passions
of
a
bigger
world
are
in
abeyance
and
thinks
that
it
should
therefore
be
the
home
of
perfect
rivalries
and
friendships
he
will
attend
the
lectures
of
which
are
outside
his
course
he
will
accept
some
hearty
excesses
in
the
rooms
of
as
equally
important
when
he
comes
up
his
sympathies
are
universal
he
is
eager
and
warm
in
his
liking
of
men
and
things
and
he
is
straightway
on
happy
terms
with
undergraduates
and
dons
after
a
few
terms
his
versatility
is
in
order
to
give
something
more
than
an
appearance
of
sympathy
in
the
company
of
athletes
reading
men
contemplative
men
and
wealthy
men
for
a
time
his
success
is
sublime
the
reading
man
thinks
there
was
never
such
a
student
the
rowing
man
approves
of
his
and
his
narratives
at
those
little
training
parties
for
the
enjoyment
of
music
port
and
fruit
togger
his
method
appeals
to
the
don
now
and
then
indeed
some
one
a
little
more
reticent
than
himself
puts
him
to
a
test
and
he
may
discourse
on
aquinas
to
a
unitarian
socialist
or
on
gargantua
to
one
deep
in
christian
mysticism
or
fresh
from
the
new
year
s
advice
of
his
in
such
cases
either
he
is
repulsed
with
sufficient
narrowness
on
the
part
of
the
other
to
supply
a
necessary
balm
or
he
makes
a
surprised
and
admiring
convert
who
may
do
odd
things
on
account
of
his
inferior
versatility
for
quite
a
long
time
he
may
have
the
good
fortune
to
let
loose
his
interest
in
the
ptolemies
in
the
neighbourhood
of
other
admirers
or
neutral
gentlemen
and
so
long
all
is
more
than
well
he
is
popular
exuberant
and
in
a
fair
way
of
growth
albeit
a
little
overdone
it
is
true
that
in
tired
moments
he
is
likely
to
choose
the
path
of
least
resistance
and
find
himself
in
not
very
versatile
company
but
what
a
life
he
leads
what
afternoons
on
the
cherwell
between
marston
and
islip
in
the
summer
and
beyond
fyfield
when
autumn
still
has
all
that
is
a
perfecting
of
summer
in
its
gift
the
admiring
plodder
who
hears
his
speeches
says
that
he
will
some
day
be
lord
chancellor
his
verses
have
something
beyond
cleverness
in
them
they
have
a
high
impulsion
as
when
spring
makes
a
crown
imperial
or
a
tulip
and
listening
to
his
talk
or
reading
his
letters
one
might
think
that
he
will
be
content
to
be
one
of
those
men
of
genius
who
avoid
fame
but
if
their
letters
are
unearthed
two
hundred
years
hence
they
will
have
the
life
of
wotton
s
or
brown
s
his
friends
think
that
such
a
gracious
brilliant
creature
would
leaven
the
senior
common
room
and
draw
out
the
shyness
of
and
twist
the
neck
of
s
exuberant
dulness
the
liberal
life
close
in
friendship
with
so
many
of
the
living
and
the
historical
on
occasions
almost
gives
him
the
freedom
of
all
time
his
friends
note
that
catullus
or
lucan
or
dante
is
nearer
to
him
than
to
other
men
he
quotes
them
as
if
he
had
lived
with
them
and
were
their
executor
and
by
his
sympathy
seems
to
have
won
a
part
authorship
of
their
finest
things
he
expounds
the
law
and
makes
it
as
exhilarating
as
the
or
as
if
it
were
a
sequel
to
and
in
history
the
dons
notice
his
picturesqueness
which
is
as
passionate
as
if
he
could
have
written
that
ardent
sonnet
the
kings
come
riding
back
from
the
crusade
the
purple
kings
and
all
their
mounted
men
they
fill
the
street
with
clamorous
cavalcade
the
kings
have
broken
down
the
saracen
singing
a
great
song
of
the
eastern
wars
in
crimson
ships
across
the
sea
they
came
with
crimson
sails
and
diamonded
dark
oars
that
made
the
mediterranean
flash
with
flame
and
reading
how
in
that
far
month
the
ranks
formed
on
the
edge
of
the
desert
armoured
all
i
wish
to
god
that
i
had
been
with
them
when
the
first
norman
leapt
upon
the
wall
and
godfrey
led
the
foremost
of
the
franks
and
young
lord
raymond
stormed
jerusalem
so
the
glories
of
youth
and
history
and
summer
mingle
in
his
brain
and
speech
no
one
is
so
married
to
his
surroundings
as
he
and
while
he
appears
to
many
to
be
shaped
by
them
beautiful
or
grotesque
as
an
animal
in
a
shell
to
a
few
he
appears
also
to
shape
them
so
that
oxford
in
his
company
is
a
new
thing
as
if
it
were
the
highest
last
creation
of
the
modern
mind
he
does
not
acquiesce
in
the
limp
mediÃ¦valism
of
the
rest
but
recreates
the
middle
ages
for
himself
finding
new
humanities
in
the
sculptures
and
beauties
in
the
perspective
strange
sympathies
between
the
monkish
work
and
the
voices
and
faces
of
those
who
sit
amidst
it
in
his
own
college
he
effects
a
surprising
modernisation
by
removing
a
little
work
and
revealing
the
original
thus
all
history
is
to
him
a
vivid
personal
experience
but
he
is
overwhelmed
by
his
versatility
and
cultivates
that
for
its
own
sake
and
at
last
loses
his
sympathy
with
all
who
are
not
as
he
the
athletes
begin
to
treat
him
as
a
poser
the
hard
workers
stand
aloof
from
his
extravagances
with
different
sets
he
is
treated
and
rejected
as
a
man
of
the
world
a
hepatetic
philosopher
a
dilettante
some
speak
of
the
literary
taint
the
dons
are
tired
he
is
in
danger
of
becoming
the
hero
of
the
most
unstable
freshman
and
his
scout
and
so
though
he
has
perhaps
but
one
failing
more
than
his
contemporaries
and
certainly
more
virtues
he
is
ridiculed
or
feared
or
despised
and
goes
about
like
leonolo
in
the
play
who
wandered
because
perhaps
among
the
crowd
i
shall
find
some
to
whom
i
may
relate
that
story
of
the
children
and
the
meat
until
he
has
the
good
luck
to
fall
back
upon
his
friends
there
he
is
safe
again
his
name
will
indeed
be
handed
down
through
half
a
dozen
undergraduate
generations
for
his
least
characteristic
adventures
but
if
that
is
a
rare
distinction
and
equivalent
to
a
press
immortality
it
is
likely
to
be
of
no
profit
to
him
where
he
used
to
be
an
expensive
copy
of
a
bohemian
he
becomes
at
last
as
near
the
genuine
thing
as
any
critic
with
a
wholesome
fear
of
being
absolute
would
care
to
pronounce
his
one
pose
is
that
of
the
natural
man
in
the
presence
of
a
snob
everywhere
he
is
as
independent
as
a
parrot
or
a
tramp
in
life
few
are
to
be
envied
so
much
for
he
achieves
everything
but
success
vii
the
important
undergraduate
is
one
who
has
been
thunderstruck
by
the
inferiority
of
the
rest
he
can
not
if
he
would
be
rid
of
the
notion
in
a
large
college
the
distinction
between
himself
and
others
is
cheerfully
acknowledged
by
them
while
he
leads
a
painful
life
in
a
small
college
for
a
year
or
two
he
is
so
handled
that
he
may
sometimes
wish
he
were
as
other
men
are
at
the
end
of
that
time
he
has
by
contagion
created
a
covey
of
important
men
and
now
to
his
moral
athletic
and
intellectual
excellence
and
his
superior
school
is
added
the
excellence
of
being
several
years
older
than
the
majority
he
establishes
a
despotism
for
the
good
of
the
college
he
is
willing
to
take
the
fellows
into
partnership
makes
advances
and
when
coyly
repulsed
has
his
sense
of
importance
increased
by
the
knowledge
that
an
opposition
exists
his
splendour
is
marred
only
by
the
stranger
who
mistakes
his
blazer
for
a
livery
and
finds
his
pomposity
well
worthy
of
such
fine
old
quadrangles
and
requests
him
with
a
smile
and
half
a
sovereign
to
exhibit
the
chapel
and
the
hall
and
tell
me
who
are
the
swells
he
walks
about
oxford
with
a
beautiful
satisfaction
a
poor
thing
but
my
own
he
seems
to
say
as
he
enters
the
college
gate
little
boys
in
the
street
pull
off
their
caps
as
he
passes
and
the
saucy
imprudent
freshman
does
the
same
he
rows
he
plays
football
and
cricket
he
debates
all
indifferently
but
with
such
an
air
that
he
and
even
some
others
for
a
time
believe
that
he
is
the
life
and
soul
of
the
college
he
has
been
captain
and
president
of
everything
when
he
finds
that
there
is
no
further
honour
open
to
him
and
he
muses
almost
with
melancholy
the
others
find
it
out
somewhat
later
he
is
dejected
though
fallen
he
is
still
majestic
he
stalks
about
like
a
foxhound
in
july
or
like
a
rebellious
archangel
is
this
the
region
this
the
soil
the
clime
once
more
october
returns
a
new
generation
of
freshmen
is
invited
to
tea
and
for
one
glorious
hour
his
old
vivacity
returns
as
he
questions
instructs
exhorts
the
president
of
the
once
said
to
me
or
when
i
was
in
the
college
boat
and
we
made
seven
bumps
such
are
his
conjuring
terms
perhaps
in
a
few
years
he
returns
to
find
that
the
college
is
not
what
it
was
and
that
his
nickname
is
still
remembered
viii
he
is
one
whom
the
important
undergraduate
regards
as
a
parody
of
himself
for
he
resembles
the
other
in
no
respect
he
is
a
clean
brave
and
modest
freshman
with
too
great
a
liking
for
the
same
qualities
in
others
to
be
disturbed
by
any
faulty
affectations
that
may
go
along
with
them
when
he
comes
up
he
has
a
few
friends
in
oxford
keeps
them
and
is
well
contented
he
plays
his
games
heartily
and
is
almost
as
glad
to
cheer
when
he
is
not
good
enough
or
pushing
enough
to
play
nothing
can
destroy
his
regular
habits
and
at
first
he
narrowly
escapes
being
despised
for
them
by
his
inferiors
he
is
comparatively
poor
and
not
very
clever
neither
has
he
any
amusing
oddities
or
stories
to
tell
or
much
whisky
to
dispense
yet
he
finds
notoriety
thrust
upon
him
if
it
were
not
for
his
firm
and
blushing
manner
he
would
never
have
his
room
empty
for
work
very
soon
he
is
the
only
man
in
the
college
who
may
sport
his
oak
with
no
fear
from
the
thunders
of
distant
and
idle
acquaintances
every
one
wishes
to
possess
him
the
athletes
can
not
withstand
his
running
his
hard
fielding
the
more
unpopular
are
first
attracted
by
his
simple
habits
as
a
freshman
and
then
surprised
that
they
are
not
repulsed
when
they
hear
that
he
will
get
his
blue
he
is
always
their
protector
the
elegant
and
stupid
men
at
least
for
a
few
terms
know
no
man
who
so
becomes
a
cigar
and
is
so
fit
to
meet
their
female
cousins
at
breakfast
the
brilliant
men
like
him
first
because
he
is
a
mystery
next
because
he
recalls
to
them
their
lost
youth
which
was
nothing
like
his
and
finally
because
he
is
so
friendly
and
so
naÃ¯vely
rebukes
their
most
venturesome
sallies
his
presence
in
a
room
is
more
than
a
wood
fire
and
a
steaming
bowl
he
seems
to
know
not
sorrow
clear
as
the
sky
withouten
blame
or
blot
it
is
to
see
his
amazement
at
sorrow
like
the
amazement
of
those
spirits
in
purgatory
who
exclaimed
as
dante
passed
the
light
seems
not
to
shine
on
one
side
of
him
though
he
behaves
as
one
that
men
of
very
different
persuasions
are
fascinated
by
the
young
greek
in
the
parks
or
on
the
river
he
is
successful
everywhere
and
is
in
time
captain
of
football
and
president
of
the
debating
and
literary
society
although
his
knowledge
of
literature
is
confined
to
scott
s
novels
and
the
of
the
he
accepts
the
advice
of
the
important
undergraduate
here
and
elsewhere
and
unconsciously
ignores
it
with
happy
results
for
his
contemporaries
believe
that
he
has
launched
his
college
upon
one
of
those
sudden
mysterious
ascensions
that
mean
social
learned
and
athletic
improvement
at
once
to
the
last
he
is
diffident
and
at
the
same
time
always
capable
of
doing
his
best
can
you
clear
that
brook
one
asks
in
the
hinksey
fields
i
don
t
know
is
the
reply
and
over
he
goes
a
foot
clear
amongst
the
orchis
not
a
great
deal
more
powerful
than
the
cox
he
strokes
a
boat
that
has
never
been
bumped
and
is
the
only
oar
whom
the
rest
all
praise
to
see
him
halting
over
a
commonplace
speech
at
a
college
function
or
making
the
most
ludicrous
new
verses
to
the
alphabetical
song
of
jolly
old
dons
and
winning
applause
or
dropping
his
head
on
his
knees
at
the
on
the
river
or
carried
for
the
hundredth
time
round
the
quadrangle
on
some
festive
night
is
nobody
knows
or
asks
why
an
inspiration
and
after
his
last
farewell
dinner
he
smiles
as
if
he
knew
everything
or
had
the
as
he
notices
the
follies
which
he
supposes
he
is
not
clever
enough
for
and
goes
down
to
his
manor
or
country
curacy
very
happily
ix
there
was
for
a
short
time
amidst
but
not
of
the
university
a
student
whom
i
can
not
but
count
as
a
clerk
of
he
came
from
no
school
but
straight
from
a
all
his
life
he
had
been
a
deep
unguided
delver
in
the
past
an
orphan
in
the
world
he
had
chosen
his
family
among
the
noble
persons
of
antiquity
cÃ¦sar
was
more
real
to
him
than
napoleon
and
cato
more
influential
than
any
millionaire
he
had
tasted
all
the
types
from
diogenes
to
seneca
and
lucullus
when
he
tired
of
his
he
tried
to
imagine
a
resemblance
between
it
and
a
city
state
but
was
himself
but
a
helot
in
the
end
so
it
happened
that
he
came
to
live
in
a
cottage
attic
five
or
six
miles
from
oxford
he
wanted
to
be
a
university
man
he
despised
scholarships
as
if
they
had
been
the
badge
of
the
legion
of
honour
colleges
he
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
because
they
spoiled
the
simplicity
of
the
idea
of
a
university
in
his
mind
they
had
made
possible
the
social
folly
of
oxford
but
in
his
reading
of
history
he
had
travelled
no
farther
than
the
middle
ages
towards
his
own
time
and
a
picture
of
oxford
life
in
that
day
fascinated
him
he
believed
that
it
was
still
possible
to
lead
the
unstable
independent
penniless
life
of
a
scholar
and
he
knew
not
why
a
student
should
hope
or
wish
to
be
anything
like
a
merchant
or
a
prince
a
merchant
had
money
and
a
prince
flattery
he
would
have
wisdom
it
was
likely
to
be
a
long
search
and
in
his
view
it
was
the
search
that
was
beyond
price
he
wanted
wisdom
as
a
man
might
want
a
star
because
it
was
a
rare
and
beautiful
thing
so
his
studies
were
a
spiritual
experience
the
short
passages
of
homer
which
he
knew
by
heart
had
something
of
religious
unction
in
his
utterance
he
left
london
afoot
with
a
parcel
of
books
strapped
to
his
shoulders
his
only
disappointment
coming
from
a
landlord
who
refused
to
pay
for
his
singing
with
a
meal
as
he
would
have
done
six
hundred
years
ago
a
farmer
treated
him
generously
under
the
belief
that
he
was
mad
a
few
antiquated
greek
texts
and
notes
an
odd
volume
of
chronicles
from
the
rolls
series
and
an
aldrich
adorned
his
room
and
with
their
help
he
hoped
to
lay
the
foundations
of
a
seraphic
universal
wisdom
gradually
he
would
become
worthy
to
use
the
bodleian
and
contend
with
the
learned
gown
and
hostile
town
once
a
week
in
the
beginning
he
walked
into
oxford
he
saw
the
river
covered
with
boats
and
laughed
happily
and
pitifully
at
men
who
seemed
to
know
nothing
about
the
uses
of
a
university
a
youth
in
rowing
knickerbockers
was
a
fit
disciple
for
his
revelations
he
thought
and
was
about
to
preach
when
he
barely
escaped
from
a
bicycle
and
a
megaphone
almost
sad
murmuring
abelard
s
line
sunt
multi
fratres
sed
in
illis
rarus
amicus
he
hastened
to
the
city
the
spires
gave
him
courage
again
and
he
ran
singing
an
old
song
when
that
i
was
a
scholar
bold
and
in
my
head
was
wealth
untold
heigh
ho
in
the
days
of
old
in
oxford
town
a
scholar
trolled
every
one
in
a
master
s
gown
received
a
bow
he
was
mistaken
for
a
literary
man
and
once
in
oxford
he
went
seriously
and
as
if
at
a
ceremony
through
a
minutely
prepared
plan
he
attended
service
at
one
of
the
churches
and
especially
mary
s
he
took
long
repeated
walks
up
and
down
high
street
and
into
all
the
lanes
which
he
hardly
knew
when
their
names
had
been
changed
then
he
sat
for
an
hour
in
the
inn
in
blessed
mood
he
tried
the
landlord
unsuccessfully
with
latin
and
waited
until
some
scholar
should
call
and
exchange
jests
with
him
in
the
learned
tongue
or
perhaps
join
him
in
a
quarrel
with
the
town
the
only
scholar
that
called
talked
in
a
strange
tongue
chiefly
to
a
and
never
to
him
and
late
at
night
he
stole
reluctantly
home
never
so
much
pleased
as
when
in
a
dark
alley
he
was
saluted
by
a
proctor
and
asked
if
he
might
be
a
member
of
the
university
but
the
little
note
inviting
him
to
be
at
college
at
on
the
following
day
never
came
and
he
was
cheated
of
the
glory
of
being
the
first
member
of
the
university
who
could
by
no
means
pay
a
fine
at
the
end
of
this
holy
day
he
spent
the
night
with
his
books
thinking
it
shame
to
sleep
away
the
ardent
illustration

of
the

at
the
east
end
of
the
hall
facing

from
the
north
by
an
oriel
window
looking
into
the
cloister

of
cloisters
portraits
of
college
dignitaries
adorn
the
walls
above
the
dado
the
long
tables
and
seats
in
the
foreground
are
used
by
the
memoried
hours
that
followed
when
sleep
caught
him
at
last
with
what
happiness
and
pomp
he
walked
down
aldate
s
and
along
blue
boar
street
and
merton
street
and
came
suddenly
upon
wren
s
domed
gate
at
queen
s
or
paused
in
mary
s
porches
or
found
the
inmost
green
sanctuary
of
wadham
gardens
once
he
dreamed
that
on
a
sunday
he
preached
from
the
little
outdoor
pulpit
at
magdalen
where
he
mounted
by
some
artifice
of
sleep
s
the
chamber
windows
and
quadrangles
were
full
his
voice
rose
and
linked
to
him
the
crowd
outside
in
high
street
all
remained
silent
even
when
it
was
known
that
the
hieroglyphics
were
skipping
from
their
perches
in
the
cloister
and
carrying
off
large
numbers
no
one
knew
whither
those
that
were
spared
and
his
voice
rose
ever
higher
and
expanded
like
the
column
and
fans
of
masonry
at
christ
church
were
stripped
of
their
waistcoats
and
ties
and
all
their
luxuries
and
dignities
their
hair
was
shaved
presently
they
were
all
cowled
and
with
a
great
shout
hailed
him
chancellor
he
floated
down
from
the
pulpit
and
led
them
down
the
high
evicting
the
pampered
tradespeople
and
fettering
all
parasites
singing
a
charging
hymn
they
marched
in
procession
to
mary
s
and
thence
to
a
feast
at
christ
church
hall
when
he
awoke
with
the
din
of
revelry
sometimes
in
his
dreams
he
saw
enacted
the
greek
tragedies
to
the
accompaniment
of
the
organs
of
new
college
and
the
cathedral
now
that
he
knew
his
plays
by
heart
he
came
oftener
to
oxford
and
gained
the
freedom
of
the
bodleian
every
day
he
came
bringing
his
own
books
to
fill
the
interval
before
the
library
books
arrived
although
for
the
most
part
he
stared
at
the
gilt
inscriptions
outside
his
alcove
window
or
at
the
trees
and
roofs
farther
off
when
he
was
hidden
among
the
expected
volumes
he
read
but
feverishly
he
put
questions
to
himself
in
the
style
of
the
schoolmen
and
pondered
whether
the
music
of
the
spheres
be
verse
or
he
tingled
all
over
with
the
learned
air
and
was
intoxicated
by
the
dust
of
a

a

young
gentleman
of

is
one
that
comes
there
to
weare
a
gowne
and
to
say
hereafter
he
has
been
at
the
universitie
his
father
sent
him
thither
because
hee
heard
there
were
the
best
fencing
and
dancing
schools
from
these
he
has
his
education
from
his
tutor
the
oversight
the
first
element
of
his
knowledge
is
to
be
shewne
the
colleges
and
initiated
in
a
taverne
by
the
way
which
hereafter
hee
will
learne
for
himselfe
the
two
marks
of
his
senioritie
is
the
bare
velvet
of
his
gowne
and
his
proficiencie
at
tennis
where
when
he
can
once
play
a
set
he
is

no
more

has
commonly
handsome
shelves

neate
silk
strings
which
he
shows
to
his
father

man
and
is
loth
to
untye
or
take
downe
for
feare
of
misplacing
upon
foule
days
for
recreation
hee
retyres
thither
and
looks
over
the
prety
booke
his
tutor
reades
to
him
which
is
commonly
some
short
historie
or
a
piece
of
for
which
his
tutor
gives
him
money
to
spend
next
day
his
maine
loytering
is
at
the
library
where
hee
studies
armes
and
bookes
of
honour
and
turnes
a
gentleman
critick
in
pedigrees
of
all
things
hee
endures
not
to
be
mistaken
for
a
scholler
and
hates
a
black
suit
though
it
be
of
satin
his
companion
is
ordinarily
some
stale
fellow
that
has
been
notorious
for
an
ingle
to
gold
hatbands
whom
hee
admires
at
first
afterward
scornes
if
hee
have
spirit
or
wit
he
may
light
of
better
company
and
may
learne
some
flashes
of
wit
which
may
doe
him
knight

in
the

hereafter
but
he
is
now
gone
to
the

he
studies

graves
a
contemporary
of
shenstone

whitfield
at

has
sketched
in
his
own
person
the
unstable
undergraduate
of
sixteen
in
his
progress
from
set
to
set
it
is
a
very
lasting
type
having
brought
with
me
he
writes
the
character
of
a
tolerably
good
grecian
i
was
invited
to
a
very
sober
little
party
who
amused
themselves
in
the
evening
with
reading
greek
and
drinking
water
here
i
continued
six
months
and
we
read
over
theophrastus
epictetus
phalaris
and
such
other
greek
authors
as
are
seldom
read
at
school
but
i
was
at
length
seduced
from
this
mortified
symposium
to
a
very
different
party
a
set
of
jolly
sprightly
young
fellows
most
of
them
lads
who
drank
ale
smoked
tobacco
punned
and
sang
bacchanalian
catches
the
whole
evening
i
began
to
think
them
the
only
wise
men
some
gentlemen
commoners
however
who
considered
the
very
low
company
chiefly
on
account
of
the
liquor
they
drank
invited
me
to
their
party
they
treated
me
with
port
wine
and
arrack
punch
and
now
and
then
when
they
had
drunk
so
much
as
hardly
to
distinguish
wine
from
water
they
would
conclude
with
a
bottle
or
two
of
claret
they
kept
late
hours
drank
their
favourite
toasts
on
their
knees
and
in
short
were
what
were
then
called
bucks

from
the
v
i
have
taken
from
glanvil
s
of
the
original
version
of
the
story
of
matthew
arnold
s
scholar
gypsy
there
was
very
lately
a
lad
in
the
university
of
oxford
who
being
of
very
pregnant
and
ready
parts
and
yet
wanting
the
encouragement
of
preferment
was
by
his
poverty
forc
d
to
leave
his
studies
there
and
to
cast
himself
upon
the
wide
world
for
a
livelyhood
now
his
necessities
growing
dayly
on
him
and
wanting
the
help
of
friends
to
relieve
him
he
was
at
last
forced
to
join
himself
to
a
company
of
vagabond
gypsies
whom
occasionally
he
met
with
and
to
follow
their
trade
for
a
maintenance
among
these
extravagant
people
by
the
insinuating
subtilty
of
his
carriage
he
quickly
got
so
much
of
their
love
and
esteem
as
that
they
discovered
to
him
their
mystery
in
the
practice
of
which
by
the
pregnancy
of
his
wit
and
parts
he
soon
grew
so
good
and
proficient
as
to
be
able
to
outdo
his
instructors
after
he
had
been
a
pretty
while
well
exercised
in
the
trade
there
chanc
d
to
ride
by
a
couple
of
scholars
who
had
formerly
bin
of
his
acquaintance
the
scholars
had
quickly
spyed
out
their
old
friend
among
the
gypsies
and
their
amazement
to
see
him
among
such
society
had
well
nigh
discovered
him
but
by
a
sign
he
prevented
their
owning
him
before
that
crew
and
taking
one
of
them
aside
privately
desired
him
with
a
friend
to
go
to
an
inn
not
far
distant
thence
promising
there
to
come
to
them
they
accordingly
went
thither
and
he
follows
after
their
first
salutations
his
friends
enquire
how
he
came
to
lead
so
odd
a
life
as
that
was
and
to
joyn
himself
with
such
a
cheating
beggarly
company
the
scholar
gypsy
having
given
them
an
account
of
the
necessity
which
drove
him
to
that
kind
of
life
told
them
that
the
people
he
went
with
were
not
such
imposters
as
they
were
taken
for
but
that
they
had
a
traditional
kind
of
learning
among
them
and
could
do
wonders
by
the
power
of
imagination
and
that
himself
had
learnt
much
of
their
art
and
improved
it
further
than
themselves
could
and
to
evince
the
truth
of
what
he
told
them
he
said
he
d
remove
into
another
room
leaving
them
to
discourse
together
and
upon
his
return
tell
them
the
sum
of
what
they
had
talked
of
which
accordingly
he
performed
giving
them
a
full
account
of
what
had
pass
d
between
them
in
his
absence
the
scholars
being
amazed
at
so
unexpected
a
discovery
earnestly
desired
him
to
unriddle
the
mystery
in
which
he
gave
them
satisfaction
by
telling
them
that
what
he
did
was
by
the
power
of
imagination
his
phancy
binding
theirs
and
that
himself
had
dictated
to
them
the
discourse
they
held
together
while
he
was
from
them
that
there
were
warrantable
wayes
of
heightening
the
imagination
to
that
pitch
as
to
bind
another
s
and
that
when
he
had
compass
d
the
whole
secret
some
parts
of
which
he
said
he
was
yet
ignorant
of
he
intended
to
leave
their
company
and
give
the
world
an
account
of
what
he
had

no
proof
of
his
insignificance
the
president
and
your
humble
servant
manage
very
well
between
us
said
one
porter
with
perfect
truth
college
servants
are
the
corbels
and
gargoyles
that
complete
the
picturesqueness
and
usefulness
of
oxford
the
oldest
are
not
so
much
serviceable
as
quaint
often
grotesque
reminders
of
an
age
that
has
gone
their
faces
are
apt
to
express
grim
judgments
upon
the
changes
which
they
have
helplessly
watched
and
they
are
among
the
stoutest
retainers
of
the
past
the
younger
are
either
very
much
like
any
other
good
silent
receptive
curious
but
uninquiring
expensive
and
better
able
to
instruct
than
to
learn
or
they
are
average
men
with
oxford
variations
in
spite
of
their
profound
knowledge
of
the
richer
classes
they
remain
as
a
body
good
conservatives
with
the
servility
of
their
order
they
do
not
often
change
the
men
whom
they
serve
are
replaced
every
year
by
others
and
looking
on
at
generation
after
generation
they
are
not
only
skilled
and
practical
psychologists
and
almost
the
only
persons
in
oxford
who
wear
silk
hats
on
sunday
but
perhaps
the
most
enduring
human
element
in
the
university
well
says
an
scout
to
another
in
an
undergraduate
dialogue
of
the
dead
well
i
suppose
gentlemen
are
no
worse
and
servants
no
better
than
in
my
time
such
a
thing
is
impossible
was
the
reply
yet
one
may
surmise
that
they
are
more
plutocratic
at
least
than
they
were
if
it
be
true
that
every
summer
at
a
scottish
hotel
one
may
find
mr
and
brown
of
college
oxford
on
the
pages
of
the
visitors
book
in
a
handwriting
known
to
the
buttery
in
the
game
which
they
play
with
the
undergraduates
they
know
all
their
opponents
cards
yet
until
a
member
of
the
university
is
admitted
to
the
cellar
and
pantry
parliament
they
will
always
be
praised
as
reticent
and
discreet
a
little
inexperience
will
soon
reveal
as
the
freshman
knows
the
other
qualities
of
the
college
servant
i
he
awakens
you
every
morning
by
playing
with
your
bath
and
is
a
perpetually
recurring
background
to
the
sweet
disquiet
of
your
last
in
bed
in
serving
you
he
serves
himself
and
late
in
the
day
he
is
to
be
seen
with
a
wallet
on
his
back
bent
under
such
learning
s
crumbs
as
and
jars
of
cooper
s
marmalade
in
these
matters
he
has
a
neat
running
hand
without
flourishes
no
man
has
the
air
of
being
so
much
as
he
the
right
hand
of
fate
when
he
drinks
your
wine
and
disappoints
a
joyous
company
when
he
assumes
your
best
cigars
and
leaves
only
those
which
were
provided
for
the
freshman
of
taste
so
inevitable
are
his
ways
that
you
can
only
hope
sarcastically
that
he
liked
the
fare
he
appears
to
have
a
noble
scorn
of
cash
when
he
asks
for
it
and
you
are
bound
to
imitate
all
the
wisdom
of
the
wise
is
cheap
compared
with
his
manner
of
beginning
a
speech
with
if
you
please
sir
it
is
usual
for
freshmen
to
while
he
is
dusting
your
photographs
he
is
blessed
with
an
incapacity
to
blush
his
politics
are
those
of
the
majority
his
religion
has
something
in
common
with
that
of
all
men
he
could
be
conscientiously
recommended
for
a
post
in
a
temple
niche
or
a
street
corner
with
the
inscription
for
twenty
years
a
mate
at
sea
and
blinded
in
the
pursuit
of
my
duties
or
crippled
in
he
is
equalled
only
by
his
boy
who
is
perhaps
older
than
himself
i
remember
one
such
i
should
like
to
have
known
his
tailor
who
must
have
had
a
genius
for
style
for
fitting
aptest
clothes
for
men
his
coat
was
as
as
panurge
s
and
as
wonderful
its
bulges
and
creases
were
an
epitome
of
its
hang
might
serve
as
the
one
true
epitaph
if
suspended
over
his
tomb
with
all
his
faults
he
had
that
toleration
which
the
vicious
often
extend
to
the
good
but
do
not
often
receive
in
return
he
was
a
fellow
of
infinite
wiles
that
were
wasted
but
not
thrown
away
in
a
world
of
three
or
four
quadrangles
and
a
buttery
full
of
traditions
he
was
their
master
not
their
prey
and
though
he
was
the

seemed
conscious
of
being
their
inheritor
too
for
he
had
served
men
who
had
got
fellowships
and
even
rugby
or
rowing
blues
with
leading
cases
out
of
this
mighty
past
he
defended
his
misdemeanours
and
supported
his
proposals
in
vain
he
toiled
after
time
he
was
always
a
generation
behind
if
a
man
failed
in
smalls
or
divinity
he
was
told
that
the
varsity
did
no
less
and
who
rowed
at
henley
and
was
sent
down
after
a
bonfire
was
ploughed

times

like

wore
his

tyrannising
over

were
never

and
smiling
away
awe
and
ridicule
alike

never

nor

as
pirithous
he
might
have
said
it
mattered
little
to
him
and
even
pirithous
was
only
respected
after
many
years
when
he
had
become
an
investment
of
the
boy
he
quoted
wise
saws
was
full
of
advice
offered
with
a
kind
of
humility
and
yet
indifference

of
the
college
cook
it
is
easy
to
say
too
much
he
is
a
potentate
against
whom
there
is
no
appeal
on
earth
much
knavery
says
ben
jonson
may
be
vented
in

in

days
of

he
could
offer
in
exchange
for
a
recipe
an
introduction
to
some
country
at
the
monastic
door
of
his
kitchen
as
he
meditates
his
mysteries
something
of
the
middle
ages
clings
to
him
yet
and
he
is
half
an
abbot
contemptuous
of
a
generation
that
makes
small
demand
upon
his
subtlety
and
wealth
it
is
said
that
he
comes
of
brilliant
ancestry
and
has
fallen
what
heights
there
may
be
in
the
world
from
which
a
man
could
be
said
to
fall
in
becoming
a
college
cook
i
do
not
know
for
years
he
made
clear
the
distinction
between
fancy
and
imagination
by
fancy
he
lived
and
on
his
fancies
generations
fed
he
could
disguise
the
meanest
materials
and
make
them
illustrious
subtle
or
exquisitely
sweet
he
was
propter
convivia
in
his
grey
kitchen
with
chestnut
beams
aloft
a
visitor
seemed
to
assist
at
the
inauguration
of
a
perpetual
spring
on
the
one
hand
was
the
earth
the
raw
material
the
mere
flesh
or
fish
and
out
of
this
with
upturned
sleeves
like
artist
or
conjuror
he
made
the
flowers
flourish
and
the
leaves
abound
by
the
perfume
it
was
a
mysterious
indoor
mayday
and
so
he
lived
and
was
feared
and
respected
but
it
was
admitted
that
he
had
rivals
something
in
a
grander
style
was
yet
to
be
done
it
was
wherever
i
looked
i
saw
first
the
cold
white
sky
above
and
the
snow
beneath
and
secondly
the
red
faces
of
skaters
out
of
doors
and
indoors
the
blaze
of
great
fires
and
the
purple
and
gold
of
wine
winter
was
to
be
met
in
every
street
it
is
true
but
nevertheless
a
lusty
fellow
redder
than
autumn
with
a
grip
of
the
hands
and
a
roaring
voice
as
i
passed
the
kitchen
the
cook
was
silently
at
work
his
hair
was
like
the
snow
his
face
like
the
fire
the
brass
steel
pewter
and
silver
shone
the
kitchen
with
its
fragrance
lustre
and
quietness
was
like
an
altar
there
too
was
the
priest
with
stainless
vestment
and
sacerdotal
bearing
and
as
i
left
him
and
mounted
the
stairs
i
seemed
unblest
i
found
scott
tedious
pater
excessive
and
sir
thomas
browne
a
trifler
and
threw
them
aside
soon
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
and
a
man
a
throne
domination
princedom
virtue
power
swept
magnificently
in
a
light
and
a
warmth
beyond
the
power
of
fire
to
bestow
accompanied
him
he
bent
down
solemnly
and
laid
a
little
white
covered
plate
upon
the
hearth
before
i
could
speak
the
gods
themselves
are
hard
to
recognise
he
was
gone
i
uncovered
the
plate
with
something
of
my
visitant
s
solemnity
fair
spirit
of
ethereal
birth
in
whom
such
mysteries
and
beauties
blend
still
from
thine
ancient
descend
and
idealise
our
too
material
earth
still
to
the
bard
thy
chaste
conceptions
lend
to
him
thine
early
purity
renew
round
every
image
grace
majestic
throw
till
rapturously
the
living
song
shall
glow
with
inspiration
as
thy
being
true
and
poesy
s
creations
decked
by
thee
shall
wake
the
tuneful
thrill
of
sensuous
ecstasy
it
was
the
climacteric
of
his
career
and
he
shall
go
down
to
posterity
upon
the
palates
of
men
not
as
one
who
worked
out
his
recipes
to
three
places
of
decimals
or
as
a
distinguished
maker
of
bishop
or
posset
or
as
one
worth
his
weight
in
oysters
but
as
the
creator
of
that
necessary
which
is
in
fact
brown
bread
toasted
and
buttered
iii
most
pontifical
of
all
college
servants
was
old
acamas
who
was
not
long
ago
to
be
seen
in
his
retirement
apparently
beating
the
city
bounds
and
now
and
then
standing
sentry
and
defender
of
some
old
gate
or
archway
i
first
noticed
him
in
the
chapel
quadrangle
of
and
could
almost
have
mistaken
him
for
a
fellow
of
the
old
school
such
was
his
aspect
and
the
reverent
air
with
which
he
surveyed
the
buildings
but
he
took
off
his
hat
to
the
junior
fellow
and
i
was
undeceived
there
was
something
pathetic
in
that
salute
he
was
himself
apparently
far
worthier
than
the
young
man
in
flannels
of
the
chapel
and
the
ancient
arms
and
he
seemed
to
know
it
as
he
bent
and
trembled
over
his
stick
to
declaim
he
may
be
a
very
clever
young
gentleman
but
bless
me
it
is
not
the
greek
that
makes
the
scholar
there
was
the
old
president
who
never
looked
at
his
book
and
was
all
for
horses
but
he
had
a
way
with
him
he
would
swear
just
so
so
he
was
a
scholar
if
ever
a
man
was
but
the
new
ones
are
just
all
book
or
all
play
they
came
in
about
the
same
time
as
bicycles
and
steam
ploughs
and
such
nonsense
and
there
s
too
much
lady
about
the
college
now
and
such
ladies
they
are
so
dressed
that
it
is
hard
to
tell
which
of
them
is
quite
respectable
and
so
he
went
on
a
little
less
reverent
than
he
looked
but
it
was
only
a
crimson
heat
of
old
age
and
soon
passed
what
a
fine
decent
figure
he
was
he
was
clothed
in
a
dull
black
suit
with
black
tie
and
an
hat
and
wore
his
gloves
he
had
unquestionably
a
professional
mien
and
could
not
have
been
a
gardener
or
groom
he
was
something
old
settled
in
the
land
and
known
to
the
stars
traditional
his
sorrow
was
nothing
less
dignified
than
disestablishment
it
was
time
to
be
going
the
enemy
was
in
possession
and
insulting
he
had
been
in
the
balliol
fellows
garden
ages
ago
and
knew
what
a
line
the
old
buildings
made
against
the
sky
and
what
the
scene
is
now
he
would
walk
about
hoping
to
express
a
volley
of
scorn
by
his
silence
to
persons
with
no
ear
for
silence
he
never
went
into
tom
quad
at
christ
church
without
missing
the
figure
of
mercury
perhaps
a
copy
from
john
of
bologna
and
taken
down
early
last
century
which
used
to
preside
over
the
fountain
still
known
as
illustration
the
tom
quadrangle
christ
church
from
the
south
entrance
this
quadrangle
was
formerly
cloistered
the
springers
the
wall
ribs
of
the
vaulting
and
the
bases
of
the
buttresses
may
be
seen
on
the
two
sides
of
the
quadrangle
shown
in
the
picture
the
great
hall
and
tower
founded
by
cardinal
wolsey
are
on
the
right
or
southern
side
whilst
opposite
over
the
eastern
buildings
rise
the
tower
and
spire
of
the
cathedral
church
of
christ
in
part
of
the
basin
of
the
fountain
is
seen
on
the
left
the
time
is
late
afternoon
in
mercury
and
used
as
a
water
ordeal
or
court
of
ultimate
appeal
by
undergraduates
that
old
pagan
fellow
he
used
to
say
told
you
more
about
the
size
of
that
quadrangle
than
the
do
and
certainly
nothing
short
of
that
or
a
playing
fountain
would
so
pleasantly
expound
the
spaciousness
of
wolsey
s
square
when
some
one
proposed
burning
in
effigy
certain
officials
at
the
time
of
edward
s
coronation
he
did
not
remember
that
such
things
were
done
at
george
he
stopped
to
look
at
the
new
buildings
of
the
college
and
pointing
at
the
whitened
stone
said
i
don
t
believe
that
stone
is
stone
at
as
he
passed
an
entry
full
of
bicycles
he
said
sadly
without
a
thought
of
scorn
it
was
built
by
public
subscription
and
with
his
hand
in
his
pocket
he
seemed
to
be
thinking
that
the
finest
thing
in
the
world
was
to
be
the
sole
founder
of
a
college
he
once
had
a
distant
prospect
of
the
banbury
road
and
would
like
to
make
night
beautiful
with
its
burning
he
still
leaves
oxford
by
coach
or
not
at
all
i
believe
that
he
calls
market
street
cheyney
lane
and
brasenose
lane
st
mildred
s
and
pembroke
street
pennyfarthing
to
hear
him
talk
of
scholastica
s
day
gives
one
a
pretty
notion
of
the
antiquity
of
oxford
and
himself
in
on
that
day
several
scholars
found
fault
with
the
wine
of
a
city
vintner
and
threw
it
at
his
prosperous
face
the
vintner
gathered
his
neighbours
and
threatened
martin
s
bell
was
rung
and
the
city
made
fierce
preparations
at
the
accustomed
summons
then
mary
s
bell
was
rung
and
the
university
came
forth
with
bows
and
arrows
and
slings
slay
and
havock
and
give
good
knocks
cried
the
citizens
the
fight
was
long
and
bloody
and
disastrous
to
the
scholars
so
for
many
centuries
the
city
had
to
appear
penitentially
at
mary
s
on
scholastica
s
day
in
this
institution
ceased
at
the
corporation
s
request
but
acamas
will
never
forgive
them
and
hardly
the
university
for
giving
way
when
laudable
old
customs
dwindle
tis
a
sign
learning
dwindles
he
would
say
as
hearne
said
when
there
were
no
longer
any
fritters
at
dinner
nor
is
he
to
be
moved
by
the
mundane
glories
of
his
college
in
the
schools
or
elsewhere
a
brilliant
examinee
of
the
college
and
his
particular
aversion
having
gained
a
first
in
law
when
it
was
pointed
out
to
him
by
the
scholar
s
scout
the
old
man
remarked
and
now
i
hope
he
knows
what
a
privilege
it
is
to
belong
to
this
how
slow
and
decorous
he
was
at
the
buttery
hatch
performing
even
his
own
business
as
if
he
were
about
that
of
another
he
carried
a
plate
as
if
it
were
a
ceremony
and
his
imperturbability
would
have
completely
endowed
a
railway
porter
and
several
judges
in
hall
when
once
the
needs
of
all
the
diners
had
been
supplied
he
would
stand
like
teneriffe
or
atlas
unremoved
an
effigy
a
symbol
of
olden
piety
and
order
bent
on
asserting
sweet
ancient
things

fare
ill
with

he
dogs
lest
they
should
commit
some
desecration
he
can
hardly
permit
smoking
in

and
has
to
turn
his
back
to
avoid
seeing
the
accursed
thing
at
one
time
a
man
dared
not
run
through
the
purlieus
of
the
divinity
school
for
fear
of
the
nod
of
acamas
he
is
a
mirror
of
good
manners
which
he
has
learned
out
of
love
and
not
necessity
he
has
a
great
store
of
antique
information
statutes
precedents
fables
which
as
in
an
aumbry
he
keeps
fragrant
by
much
meditation
and
is
pleased
to
display
his
elaborate
courtesies
are
interpreted
almost
as
insults
by
the
new
generations
men
wonder
what
they
have
done
to
deserve
his
withering
respect
it
is
reported
that
on
one
occasion
at
twilight
a
vigorous
gentleman
brushed
past
him
between
the
camera
and
brasenose
acamas
turned
with
a
soft
and
bitter
protest
against
a
gentleman
forcing
what
he
could
if
said
he
the
were
here
he
should
know
that
a
gentleman
had
insulted
an
old
college
servant
by
mistaking
him
for
a
he
bowed
and
almost
broke
his
heart
when
he
recognised
the
beaming
face
of
the
he
is
the
corrector
of
all
new
abuses
and
the
defender
of
old
and
through
his
father
a
college
butler
and
long
since
dead
he
has
the
times
of
trafalgar
fresh
in
his
mind
with
imposing
memories
of
the
days
when
oxford
was
jacobite
the
subtle
distinguishing
marks
of
all
the
colleges
as
far
as
concerns
fashions
of
morals
and
manners
scholarship
and
sport
he
knows
by
heart
and
professes
such
an
experienced
acquaintance
with
like
matters
that
in
the
high
or
by
the
long
bridges
he
knows
at
sight
a
greats
man
or
a
stinks
man
or
a
mathematician
of
which
last
he
is
a
determined
hater
and
when
on
one
occasion
he
remarked
on
the
good
looks
of
a
certain
plain
person
he
was
forced
to
explain
that
he
meant
for
a
he
would
at
need
devise
a
new
coat
of
arms
for
magdalen
or
john
s
or
improve
the
devil
that
looks
over
of
his
own
college
he
knows
everything
from
the
cobweb
on
jeremy
taylor
in
the
library
to
the
oldest
beam
in
the
kitchen
roof
he
knows
the
benefactors
and
their
benefactions
their
rank
and
everything
but
the
way
to
pronounce
their
names
and
has
a
kind
of
unofficial
bidding
prayer
in
celebration
of
their
good
deeds
his
ideal
of
a
head
of
a
college
is
an
odd
mixture
of
dean
gaisford
and
tatham
of
lincoln
for
he
demands
some
eccentricity
along
with
dignity
and
repute
and
in
the
course
of
of
a
century
he
has
combined
the
two
the
chairs
he
knows
better
than
those
who
sit
in
them
their
history
and
their
peculiarities
and
who
have
sat
therein
by
nice
observation
he
is
aware
of
the
correct
way
of
crossing
a
quadrangle
and
of
whose
furniture
should
be
consumed
in
bonfires
the
spires
and
gateways
of
the
city
are
close
friends
to
him
and
isn
t
beautiful
or
isn
t
looking
well
or
they
have
their
little
ways
is
his
comment
as
he
passes
one
or
other
of
the
things
that
have
brooded
over
his
life
continually
he
can
tell
when
the
bats
will
come
out
of
the
tower
in
a
fine
january
or
a
windy
march
when
the
swifts
shall
scream
first
by
all
saints
and
the
colour
of
new
college
tower
when
a
storm
is
due
from
the
west
i
can
think
of
him
as
being
the
deity
of
the
place
in
a
mythopÅic
age
and
picture
him
with
fritillaries
in
his
hoary
locks
as
the
genius
of
isis
up
in
a
niche
at
the
bodleian
the
past
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
past
had
many
such
to
show
and
that
the
present
when
it
has
graduated
into
a
past
will
not
be
found
wanting
but
the
ways
of
the
college
servants
of
old
are
buried
deep
in
oblivion
they
were
less
numerous
then
when
a
senior
and
a
junior
student
slept
in
the
same
room
and
the
latter
made
the
beds
etc
upon
scholars
and
the
like
fell
a
great
many
of
the
duties
which
are
now
the
scout
s
as
waiting
at
the
fellows
table
in
hall
and
the
pleasanter
although
more
thankless
task
of
calling
up
the
fellows
and
more
luxurious
commoners
in
the
morning
not
only
was
the
scholar
or
servitor
a
practical
servant
for
part
of
his
time
but
the
regular
servants
could
be
students
also
and
we
may
guess
from
the
corpus
statutes
that
they
must
sometimes
have
attended
lectures
and
have
taken
degrees
a
story
runs
that
a
vain
scholar
had
sent
some
latin
verses
to
his
tutor
by
the
hand
of
a
servant
who
quickly
read
and
corrected
them
to
the
humiliation
of
the
scholar
when
he
received
them
back
with
the
comment
that
his
work
seemed
to
have
been
revised
by
one
who
was
acquainted
with
the
latin
tongue
no
doubt
a
man
of
this
stamp
often
rose
or
if
he
stayed
in
college
made
his
attainments
profitable
a
man
who
was
once
manciple
at
wadham
became
a
noted
maker
of
mathematical
instruments
the
manciple
bought
and
distributed
provisions
in
the
college
the
cook
or

entrance
to
queen

across
the

the

of

one

the
most

that

george

the
buildings
on
the
left
of
the

belong
to
university
college
cooks
and
butlers
were
sometimes
called
upon
to
furnish
a
banquet
of
nine
hundred
messes
of
meat
with
twelve
hundred
hogsheads
of
beer
and
four
hundred
and
sixteen
of
wine
as
at
balliol
when
a
chancellor
of
years
of
age
was
installed
the
porter
was
prominent
but
as
yet
much
subordinated
to
the
head
of
the
college
to
whom
he
delivered
the
keys
at
an
early
hour
the
barber
who
was
sometimes
also
the
porter
was
the
welcome
dispenser
of
true
and
false
news
and
at
wadham
survived
until
the
sixties
of
last
century
when
he
insisted
that
the
amateur
actors
should
have
their
wigs
dressed
by
him
under
pain
of
being
betrayed
to
the
warden
of
the
old
servants
prisca
we
can
only
guess
at
the
devotion
from
the
story
of
old
thomas
allen
s
servitor
who
was
overawed
by
his
master
s
mathematical
instruments
and
his
reputation
of
astrologer
and
would
impose
on
freshmen
or
simple
people
by
telling
them
that
spirits
were
often
to
be
met
coming
up
allen
s
staircase
like
john
earle
has
preserved
the
ways
of
an
old
college
butler
from
his
experience
as
a
fellow
of
merton
an
old
college
butler
is
none
of
the
worst
students
in
the
house
for
he
keeps
the
set
hours
at
his
book
more
duly
than
any
his
authority
is
great
over
men
s
good
names
which
he
charges
many
times
with
shrewd
aspersions
which
they
can
hardly
wipe
off
without
payment
his
box
and
counters
prove
him
to
be
a
man
of
reckoning
yet
he
is
stricter
in
his
accounts
than
a
usurer
and
delivers
not
a
farthing
without
writing
he
doubles
the
pain
of
for
his
books
go
out
once
a
quarter
and
they
are
much
in
the
same
nature
brief
notes
and
sums
of
affairs
and
are
out
of
request
as
soon
his
comings
in
are
like
a
tailor
s
from
the
shreds
of
bread
the
chippings
and
remnants
of
the
broken
crust
excepting
his
vails
from
the
barrel
which
poor
folks
buy
for
their
hogs
but
drink
themselves
he
divides
a
halfpenny
loaf
with
more
subtility
than
and
subdivides
the
primo
so
nicely
that
a
stomach
of
great
capacity
can
hardly
apprehend
it
he
is
a
very
sober
man
considering
his
manifold
temptations
of
drink
and
strangers
and
if
he
be
overseen
tis
within
his
own
liberties
and
no
man
ought
to
take
exceptions
he
is
never
so
well
pleas
d
with
his
place
as
when
a
gentleman
is
beholding
to
him
for
showing
him
the
buttery
whom
he
greets
with
a
cup
of
single
beer
and
sliced
manchet
and
tells
him
tis
the
fashion
of
the
college
he
domineers
over
freshmen
when
they
first
come
to
the
hatch
and
puzzles
them
with
strange
language
of
cues
and
cees
and
some
broken
latin
which
he
has
learnt
at
his
bin
his
faculty
extraordinary
is
the
warming
of
a
pair
of
cards
and
telling
out
a
dozen
of
counters
for
post
and
pair
and
no
man
is
more
methodical
in
these
businesses
thus
he
spends
his
age
till
the
tap
of
it
is
run
out
and
then
a
fresh
one
is
set
the
oxford
day
chapter
vi
the
oxford
day
with
cares
that
move
not
agitate
the
heart
in
other
cities
the
past
is
a
tradition
and
is
at
most
regretted
in
oxford
it
is
an
entailed
inheritance
nevertheless
by
way
of
a
gaudy
foil
to
this
hale
immortality
fashions
flourish
there
more
luridly
and
fade
more
suddenly
than
elsewhere
afraid
therefore
that
i
might
stumble
upon
anachronisms
unaided
i
addressed
myself
as
a
seeker
after
truth
to
several
freshmen
who
might
have
been
expected
to
know
practically
everything
one
wished
to
be
excused
because
he
was
standing
for
the
secretaryship
of
the
union
and
was
somewhat
out
of
touch
with
ordinary
he
had
been
busily
opening
debates
in
half
the
colleges
of
oxford
in
order
to
prove
his
sound
principles
and
high
capabilities
and
enclosed
this
table
of
labours
at
that
in
the
opinion
of
this
house
his
majesty
s
government
has
done
its
at
that
the
struggles
of
the
poor
towards
a
larger
and
freer
life
are
not
to
be
at
that
vegetarianism
is
opposed
alike
to
our
traditions
and
our
present
also
later
to
oppose
that
a
wave
of
imperialism
causes
a
reformation
in
the
standards
of
birthday
at
that
poets
are
the
interpreters
of
their
at
that
in
encouraging
sports
this
university
approaches
more
nearly
to
the
greek
ideal
than
at
any
other
period
of
its
existence
has
been
the
at
a
paper
on
mentality
in
life
and
at
that
oxford
has
not
sufficiently
realised
and
reformed
its
national
position
since
imperialism
became
an
acknowledged
another
gentleman
of
more
tender
years
and
less
exuberance
forwarded
the
of
his
college
junior
gaudy
in
itself
a
pleasant
reminder
of
the
more
solid
occupations
of
undergraduates
he
had
made
a
table
of
a
day
s
life
alongside
the
dishes
like
this
macedoine
senior
turbot
and
lobster

s
he
had
no
time
for
of
the
third
answer
i
can
just
see
this
fragment
in
a
fine
confident
penmanship
among
the
flames
oxford
life
falls
under
three
heads
which
i
shall
discuss
separately
they
are
religion
education
and
social
life
and
first
of
education
my
tutor
breakfasts
at
eight
he
has
pupils
and
four
ladies
from
somerville
college
he
has
one
lecture
and
s
to
prepare
in
the
afternoon
he
will
be
fresh
and
cheerful
at
the
college
barge
watching
the
races
he
is
writing
two
books
and
is
on
the
board
of
guardians
in
spite
of
this
the
great
thing
about
oxford
education
is
the
way
it
stamps
a
man
the
cast
of
vere
de
vere
as
the
poet
says
no
matter
in
what
position
in
life
his
lot
is
thrown
a
certain
easy
grace
i
find
a
more
rational
description
of
an
oxford
day
as
it
was
in
and
as
it
was
up
to
the
publication
of
rhodes
s
will
in
the
one
of
the
most
enduring
of
undergraduate
periodicals
the
whole
history
of
philosophy
says
the
writer
n
olan
is
simply
the
story
of
an
ordinary
oxford
day
in
the
morning
when
i
awake
the
eastern
dawn
as
it
shines
into
my
room
gives
my
philosophy
an
oriental
tinge
i
turn
buddhist
and
lie
thinking
of
nothing
then
i
rise
and
at
once
my
tenets
are
those
of
the
ionics
i
think
with
thales
that
water
is
the
great
first
principle
under
this
impression
i
take
my
bath
then
yielding
to
animaxander
i
begin
to
believe
in
the
unlimited
and
straightway
in
a
rude
toilette
consume
an
infinite
amount
of
breakfast
this
leads
to
the
throwing
open
of
my
window
at
which
i
sit
an
unconscious
disciple
of
anaximenes
and
a
believer
in
the
universal
agency
of
air
i
lock
my
door
and
sit
down
to
read
mathematics
seeming
a
very
pythagorean
in
my
loneliness
and
reverence
for
numbers
i
am
disturbed
by
a
knock
i
open
the
door
and
admit
my
who
wishes
to
remove
the
breakfast
things
she
is
evidently
an
eleatic
for
she
makes
an
abstraction
of
everything
material
and
reduces
my
table
to
a
state
of
pure
being
again
i
am
alone
and
as
i
complete
my
toilet
before
my
mirror
i
hold
as
heraclitus
did
the
principle
of
the
becoming
and
think
that
it
and
it
only
should
be
the
rule
of
existence
i
saunter
to
the
window
and
ponder
upon
the
advantages
or
otherwise
of
taking
a
walk
i
am
kept
at
home
by
some
theory
of
the
elements
such
as
possessed
empedocles
now
i
bethink
me
of
my
lunch
and
i
become
an
atomist
in
my
hunger
as
i
compare
the
two
states
of
fulness
and
void
at
last
atomistic
necessity
prevails
and
i
ring
my
bell
lunch
over
i
walk
out
and
am
much
amused
as
usual
with
the
men
i
meet
i
notice
that
those
who
have
intellect
superior
to
their
fellows
neglect
their
personal
appearance
these
i
think
are
followers
of
anaxagoras
they
believe
in
Î½Î¿á¿¦Ï
and
they
deny
the
becoming
others
i
noticed
to
be
bent
upon
some
violent
exercise
i
feel
myself
small
and
weak
beside
them
wondering
much
whether
i
who
to
them
am
but
half
a
man
am
man
enough
to
be
considered
sophistically
the
measure
of
all
things
i
console
myself
with
remarking
to
myself
that
i
surely
know
my
work
for
the
schools
better
than
they
behold
i
am
socratic
virtue
i
say
consists
in
knowing
so
i
chatter
away
to
myself
feeling
quite
platonic
in
my
dialogue
until
i
meet
a
luckless
friend
who
is
to
be
examined
next
day
in
moderations
i
walk
out
with
him
far
into
the
country
talking
to
him
about
his
work
and
struggling
against
my
antipathy
to
exertion
of
any
kind
surely
aristotle
could
not
have
been
more
peripatetic
or
chrysippus
more
stoical
the
makes
me
epicurean
and
i
pass
unconsciously
over
many
stages
of
philosophy
i
spend
an
hour
in
the
rooms
of
a
friend
who
is
reading
hard
for
honours
i
come
away
but
little
impressed
with
the
philosophy
of
the
schoolmen
the
evening
passes
like
a
dream
i
have
vague
thoughts
of
recurring
to
my
former
good
habits
of
home
correspondence
but
this
revival
of
letters
passes
by
leaving
me
asleep
in
my
chair
here
again
as
at
dinner
i
doubtless
pass
through
many
unconscious
stages
at
length
i
begin
to
muse
upon
bed
it
is
a
habit
of
mine
to
yield
to
the
vulgar
fascinations
of
strong
liquors
before
retiring
for
the
night
philosophy
i
learn
works
in
a
circle
ever
returning
unto
itself
it
is
for
this
reason
perhaps
that
my
last
waking
act
is
inspired
both
by
hegel
and
thales
hegel
prompts
me
to
crave
for
spirit
thales
influences
me
to
temper
it
with
yet
if
the
oxford
day
as
is
fitting
can
always
be
expressed
in
terms
of
philosophy
it
is
sometimes
more
complex
often
more
simple
than
that
and
it
is
longer
it
begins
and
ends
at
at
that
hour
the
student
and
the
fanatical
forgetful
of
time
the
passive
bacchanalian
and
the
man
who
prefers
the
divine
oxford
chair
to
bed
are
usually
persuaded
to
retire
for
unacademic
voices
of
servant
and
starling
begin
to
be
heard
in
the
quadrangle
the
blackbird
is
awake
in
the
shrubbery
very
soon
the
scout
will
appear
and
will
not
know
whether
to
say
or
and
with
the
vacant
face
of
one
who
has
slept
through
all
the
blessed
hours
of
night
will
drive
men
to
bed
there
is
a
dreamy
laying
aside
of
books
volumes
of
daudet
and
dickens
fielding
and
abbÃ©
prÃ©vost
morley
roberts
and
poe
old
plays
and
romances
stubbs
and
the
chronicles
stuart
pamphlets
thucydides
aristotle
and
later
latin
than
quintilian
if
there
is
to
be
a
divinity
examination
later
in
the
morning
there
are
bibles
scattered
up
and
down
epitomes
and
a
sound
of
men
s
voices
asking
the
difference
between
one
and
another
version
of
a
parable
and
who
was
gallio
and
preparing
all
the
playful
acrobatics
that
will
pass
for
knowledge
in
the
schools
while
these
are
trying
to
sleep
with
the
gold
sunlight
winning

their

the
chapel
of
the
college
rebuilt
by

in
the
centre
of

with
its

forms
a
conspicuous
feature
in

below
is
that
part
of
the
college
fronting
the
on
the
right
are
some
of
the
buildings
of
jesus
college
the
sun
of
a
late
summer
afternoon
strikes
the
western
gable
of
the
chapel
eyelids
one
or
two
picked
men
are
rising
of
their
own
free
will
and
some
because
they
have
to
run
in
the
parks
before
a
training
breakfast
others
are
arguing
with
themselves
or
with
their
scouts
that
it
can
not
possibly
be
nearly
seven
or
later
on
that
a
passing
bell
or
a
has
been
mistaken
for
the
college
chapel
bell
others
expelling
the
awakening
scout
with
more
frankness
some
doze
and
doze
with
alternate
pricks
of
conscience
and
necessity
and
desperately
deciding
to
rise
have
to
saunter
about
too
late
for
chapel
too
early
for
breakfast
the
majority
murmuring
that
all
is
well
and
enjoying
the
pleasantest
of
thefts
from
daylight
for
to
the
man
who
need
not
or
will
not
rise
the
chapel
bell
is
a
blithe
and
kindly
spirit
that
sets
a
crown
upon
the
bliss
of
oncoming
sleep
and
gives
a
keener
edge
to
his
complacency
as
he
thinks
of
the
cold
sleepy
virtue
that
walks
in
the
world
below
the
chaplain
a
man
of
habit
is
also
getting
up
no
one
has
ever
seen
a
fellow
late
for
chapel
when
the
service
is
over
those
who
have
attended
are
either
awake
or
asleep
again
the
service
itself
is
of
an
awakening
kind
and
has
a
vigour
that
is
unknown
outside
oxford
oh
dear
and
saintly
chaplain
time
toils
after
you
in
vain
when
you
stroked
the
eight
to
glory
did
you
prove
this
quite
so
plain
as
at

chapel
daily
and
at
evensong
again
so
run
the
verses
which
express
the
kind
of
vigour
in
vogue
now
the
perfervid
reading
man
and
the
man
whose
genealogical
tree
is
conspicuous
for
a
constant
succession
of
maiden
aunts
go
to
their
cocoa
and
eggs
and
within
three
hours
afterwards
the
average
man
to
porridge
fish
eggs
and
bacon
coffee
and
oranges
the
decadent
to
cigars
liqueurs
and
wafers
the
Ã¦sthete
to
his
seven
wonders
and
a
daffodil
and
some
of
all
classes
to
the
consolations
of
philosophy
and
only
the
habitually
break
their
fast
in
solitude
for
it
is
in
oxford
the
most
social
meal
of
the
day
it
may
begin
at
any
time
from
eight
until
eleven
anything
later
being
brunch
and
last
until
one
some
even
believe
that
an
invitation
to
breakfast
embraces
the
afternoon
lectures
seldom
interfere
with
the
meal
since
the
man
who
leaves
for
their
sake
is
not
usually
missed
a
very
early
breakfast
is
pregnant
with
yawns
and
may
also
be
forgotten
a
very
late
one
is
unhappily
curtailed
ten
o
clock
is
an
ideal
to
be
striven
after
the
host
has
to
be
studious
not
to
invite
two
men
who
are
blues
or
who
are
entered
for
the
same
examinations
or
who
are
freshmen
from
the
same
school
which
would
be
apt
to
produce
treatises
instead
of
conversation
it
is
dangerous
also
to
have
two
epigrammatists
for
that
leads
to
a
game
of
shuttlecock
and
battledore
between
the
two
and
of
patience
among
the
rest
he
knows
that
four
men
incapable
of
these
things
are
coming
and
as
he
peeps
from
his
bedroom
to
see
that
all
is
ready
he
hears
their
steps
and
laughter
echoing
up
the
stairs
he
is
rapidly
surveying
them
all
in
his
mind
wondering
how
such
excellent
ingredients
will
mix
when
they
enter
having
picked
one
another
up
by
good
fortune
on
the
way
and
already
got
rid
of
a
possible
tendency
to
talk
about
politics
weather
or
dreams
they
discuss
everything
one
who
is
bound
to
be
a
fellow
starts
on
the
Ã¦sthetic
value
of
one
who
has
never
left
england
offers
a
suggestive
remark
on
swiss
scenery
or
the
effect
of
palms
against
a
sunrise
in
the
pacific
the
transitions
are
indescribably
rapid
yet
the
link
of
merely
an
epigram
or
a
laugh
or
possibly
the
very
sense
of
contrast
and
incongruity
makes
the
whole
run
on
as
some
fine
hedge
of
maple
hawthorn
holly
elm
beech
and
wild
cherry
runs
on
and
is
fine
and
nothing
else
except
to
a
botanist
the
talk
is
a
play
in
five
acts
each
man
is
in
turn
a
chorus
but
whether
the
subject
be
freshmen
or
disraeli
or
sancho
panza
or
the
english
aristocracy
it
is
treated
as
it
never
was
before
perhaps
that
is
the
result
of
the
detached
attitude
of
a
number
of
very
young
men
perhaps
it
is
because
each
in
turn
of
the
five
average
men
is
touched
with
genius
temporarily
by
accretion
from
the
other
four
one
says
a
dull
thing
another
a
silly
thing
a
third
a
rash
thing
a
fourth
a
vague
thing
and
straightway
the
fifth
catches
fire
and
blazes
with
something
of
the
true
light
from
heaven
and
he
not
less
than
the
rest
is
astonished
the
spirit
of
the
conversation
is
as
different
from
the
prandial
spirit
as
shortbread
from
wedding
cake
it
has
neither
the
richness
of
that
nor
the
frivolity
of
tea
the
breakfast
talker
seems
to
depend
very
little
on
memory
he
remembers
fewer
stories
less
of
the
book
he
read
on
the
night
before
than
at
a
later
meal
he
is
thrown
more
entirely
upon
the
resources
of
his
own
fantasy
the
experience
of
sleep
still
lies
like
a
great
water
between
him
and
yesterday
in
the
cold
young
golden
light
among
the
grey
stones
of
the
quadrangle
the
brain
too
rejoices
in
its
own
life
and
forgets
to
look
before
and
after
habit
is
weaker
he
catches
another
glimpse
of
the
clouds
of
glory
if
only
in
a
mirage
he
is
renovated
by
the
new
day
and
although
by
he
will
have
advanced
to
warmer
sympathies
and
a
more
tranquil
satisfaction
there
will
then
be
something
more
cynical
in
his
indolent
optimism
than
in
the
sharp
but
easily
warded
points
of
morning
wit
of
course
a
breakfast
party
of
men
in
training
for
the
torpids
is
another
thing
that
is
a
question
of
arithmetic
so
too
with
a
breakfast
given
formally
to
freshmen
which
is
mainly
a
question
of
time
and
stories
about
dons
breakfasts
with
fellows
are
either
of
the
best
kind
or
they
are
ceremonies
there
are
some
colleges
where
the
fellows
not
only
feel
that
there
is
no
need
of
condescension
but
they
do
not
condescend
the
elder
is
not
expected
to
be
preternaturally
simple
nor
the
younger
to
be
abstruse
in
other
colleges
such
breakfasts
of
the
great
and
small
are
sometimes
farces
and
sometimes
ceremonies
the
don
knows
that
the
other
s
knowledge
of
the
is
small
the
undergraduate
is
equally
aware
of
the
fact
the
one
assumes
that
he
has
an
index
to
the
other
s
mind
the
other
that
one
so
scathing
in
his
opinion
of
essays
will
be
the
same
in
his
treatment
of
little
quips
about
the
colonial
secretary
or
accounts
of
in
the
christmas
vacation
one
is
determined
to
pounce
the
other
not
to
be
pounced
upon
the
scout
who
changes
the
dishes
indicates
whether
it
is
a
ceremony
or
a
farce
if
he
smiles
it
is
the
one
if
he
does
not
it
is
the
other
not
everybody
indeed
in
these
colleges
has
the
same
misfortune
though
any
one
may
as
the
young
man
who
carefully
prepared
a
paraphrase
of
one
of
the
obscurest
articles
in
the
and
two
brand
new
epigrams
artfully
inwoven
and
served
them
up
as
he
sat
down
at
the
breakfast
table
of
the
bursar
who
smiled
and
commented
moodily
what
a
boon
the
is
to
the
tired
man
but
breakfast
with
even
the
best
of
dons
has
this
disadvantage
that
he
can
bring
it
to
an
end
with
a
word
so
that
his
guest
may
afterwards
be
seen
disconsolately
reading
a
newspaper
and
feeling
that
to
have
eaten
food
is
hardly
more
to
have
breakfasted
than
to
have
dined
between
nine
and
one
o
clock
the
different
species
of
oxford
kind
are
either
within
doors
sleeping
talking
or
working
or
to
be
seen
in
various
conditions
of
unrest
observers
and
observed
in
the
high
in
pairs
or
singly
and
if
freshmen
either
stately
in
scholars
gowns
or
apparently
anxious
to
convince
others
that
they
have
just
picked
up
their
commoners
gowns
sauntering
to
the
or
to
look
at
a
cricket
pitch
or
a
dog
or
hurrying
to
lectures
with
an
earnestness
that
strangely
disappears
when
they
are
seated
and
the
lecture
is
begun
in
the
stream
of
men
there
is
one
thin
black
line
that
is
unwavering
the
line
of
men
with
white
fillets
of
sacrifice
under
their
chins
going
to
the
examination
schools
this
is
the
only
place
in
the
world
where
the
plough
is
still
wrought
into
a
weapon
of
offence
they
are
under
the
care
of
a
suitable
ferocious
wild
man
who
is
one
of
the
old
guard
of
the
opposition
to
women
at
oxford
and
in
his
bleak
invitation
to
ladies
to
proceed
to
their
appointed
rooms
lays
terrible
stress
upon
the
word
women
as
if
it
were
a
term
of
abuse
in
his
strange
tongue
he
is
partly
responsible
for
the
reply
of
an
undergraduate
to
an
american
who
asked
what
might
be
the
name
of
the
buildings
which
he
so
admired
and
which
made
him
feel
at
home
that
said
the
undergraduate
is
the
martyrs
and
who
are
those
going
in
they
are
the
but
i
thought
they
were
burned
three
hundred
years
ago
sir
said
the
undergraduate
impressively
they
are
martyred
twice
well
i
guess
oxford
is
very
middle
age
and
all
that
but
i
didn
t
know
it
went
so
far
as
that
and
the
humane
visitor
went
away
talking
of
agitation
in
the
york
of
all
oxford
pastimes
that
of
going
to
the
bookshop
illustration
entrance
to
the
divinity
school
the
doorway
through
which
a
servant
with
a
silver
poker
is
preceding
the
leads
to
the
old
divinity
school
the
window
at
the
end
of
the
lobby
usually
called
the
pig
market
looks
into
exeter
college
garden
after
breakfast
is
one
of
the
most
wise
there
the
undergraduate
meets
the
don
whose
lecture
he
has
slighted
in
fact
he
meets
every
one
there
or
escapes
them
if
he
thinks
fit
behind
one
of
the
tall
piles
some
prefer
and
hopping
contests
in
the
quadrangle
in
some
colleges
they
are
said
to
read
plato
under
the
trees
in
the
morning
in
others
it
is
to
be
presumed
in
spite
of
the
negligent
capers
of
the
wearers
that
the
hours
are
spent
in
choosing
the
necktie
or
waistcoat
best
suited
to
flame
in
the
forehead
of
the
morning
another
amusement
is
to
go
to
the
divinity
school
and
see
the
seated
between
the
two
neat
and
restless
proctors
conferring
degrees
near
and
on
either
side
of
the
daÃ¯s
the
ladies
are
enjoying
the
scene
with
no
traces
of
any
selfish
i
would
an
if
i
below
them
sit
dons
who
are
to
present
members
of
their
colleges
a
pale
superb
militant
priest
conspicuous
among
the
rows
of
english
gentlemen
farther
removed
from
authority
is
the
opposition
half
a
hundred
undergraduates
who
merrily
applaud
the
perambulations
of
the
or
the
deportment
of
their
friends
pale
blue
and
scarlet
and
hoods
make
a
brave
contrast
with
the
dead
grey
light
and
colourless
stone
of
traceried
ceiling
and
pillared
walls
and
the
dim
foliage
of
trees
and
ivy
outside
lectures
are
a
less
stately
pleasure
some
lecturers
walk
up
and
down
the
room
as
in
a
cage
and
pause
only
for
a
more
genial
remark
than
usual
with
uplifted
gown
and
back
to
the
blazing
fire
others
laugh
at
their
own
jokes
or
even
at
jokes
which
they
leave
unexpressed
some
are
stern
and
impassioned
some
appear
to
be
proposing
a
health
others
again
a
vote
of
condolence
one
came
in
clothed
for
travel
twenty
minutes
late
and
after
a
few
remarks
said
that
brevity
was
the
most
pardonable
of
the
virtues
and
that
he
had
to
catch
a
train
and
left
in
the
old
days
merton
was
famous
for
schoolmen
christ
church
for
poets
all
souls
for
orators
brasenose
for
disputants
and
so
on
says
fuller
that
is
not
quite
so
now
yet
as
then
all
are
eminent
in
some
one
kind
or
other
although
the
undergraduate
does
not
always
perceive
it
some
are
noted
for
research
some
for
views
some
for
condensation
an
impartial
observer
once
remarked
that
even
when
he
is
abridging
an
abridgment
an
oxford
lecturer
always
had
a
scratching
coughing
whispering
silence
is
respectfully
observed
once
upon
a
time
a
lady
not
english
entered
a
famous
hall
in
hand
spectacles
on
nose
went
from
place
to
place
contemplated
all
and
incurred
only
the
amazement
of
the
lecturer
and
the
admiration
of
the
audience
it
is
to
be
noticed
that
the
audience
of
what
bardoux
calls
monks
is
in
most
cases
far
more
interested
in
than
in
the
lecturer
some
will
spend
three
consecutive
hours
in
lecture
rooms
and
therein
compile
very
curious
anthologies
even
that
does
not
conduce
to
enthusiasm
and
nobody
in
recent
years
has
been
electrified
in
an
oxford
lecture
room
i
have
discovered
writes
an
outsider
with
much
difficulty
that
there
are
two
classes
in
oxford
the
learned
and
the
unlearned
my
difficulty
arose
from
the
fact
that
the
latter
were
without
coarseness
and
the
former
without
and
certainly
in
a
city
that
loves
to
light
bonfires
and
is
never
more
herself
than
when
she
is
welcoming
a
guest
enthusiasm
is
astonishingly
well
concealed
it
may
be
detected
occasionally
among
gentlemen
who
are
conducting
from
quadrangle
to
quadrangle
or
among
those
who
like
the
beer
at
lincoln
college
on
ascension
day
or
among
those
who
salute
financiers
and
others
in
the
act
of
becoming
doctors
of
civil
law
at
the
encÃ¦nia
it
was
said
that
some
one
unsuccessfully
spread
his
gown
as
a
carpet
for
the
late
rhodes
s
feet
it
is
certain
that
some
played
upon
him
with
little
jets
of
truth
very
heartily
and
asked
socratic
questions
on
that
august
occasion
at
luncheon
there
is
however
some
enthusiasm
not
for
the
meal
which
is
commonly
a
stupid
one
but
for
the
long
afternoon
to
be
spent
in
the
parks
or
on
the
river
or
in
the
country
east
to
wheatley
west
to
fyfield
these
matters
or
the
prospect
of
a
long
bookish
afternoon
indoors
or
in
the
summer
under
a
willow
on
the
cherwell
or
evenlode
encroach
too
absolutely
upon
luncheon
to
allow
it
to
be
anything
more
than
an
affair
of
knives
and
forks
as
for
the
country
a
man
used
frequently
to
walk
so
as
to
know
all
the
fields
for
twenty
miles
on
every
side
but
the
walker
is
vanishing

my
dear
sir
the
river
or
aprÃ¨s
is
the
new
college
of
the
nineteenth
century
as
an
educational
institution
it
is
unquestioned
the
college
barges
represent
perhaps
the
most
successful
oxford
architecture
of
the
age
certainly
it
was
a
thought
of
no
mean
order
which
set
that
tapering
line
of
gaudy
galleys
to
heave
and
shimmer
along
the
against
a
background
of
trees
and
grass
and
themselves
a
background
for
the
white
figures
of
the
oarsmen
it
is
a
fine
lesson
in
eloquence
to
listen
to
the
coaches
shouting
reprimand
and
advice
in
sentences
one
or
two
words
long
to
a
panting
crew
one
can
see
the
secret
of
english
success
in
the
meek
reception
which
a
number
of
conscientious
abraded
men
give
to
the
abuse
of
an
idler
on
the
bank
on
the
afternoon
of
the
races
all
is
changed
the
man
who
yesterday
shouted
potato

or

now
screams
well
rowed
all
before
and
behind
him
flows
all
of
the
university
that
can
run
a
mile
the
faces
of
all
are
expressive
in
every
inch
all
restraint
of
habit
or
decorum
is
gone
for
the
time
being
the
racing
boats
make
hardly
a
sound
and
for
the
most
part
the
rowers
hear
not
a
sound
from
the
bank
but
only
the

was

cynical
age

there
is
many
a
true
thing
said
at

in
oxford
the

are
nothing
if
not

it
is
an
irresponsible
frivolous
time

an
interregnum
between
the
tyranny
of

and
the
tyranny
of

is

nothing
is

suspect
that
some
of

love
of
parody
might
be
found
by
an
investigator
in

oxford
tea

poison

is
no
wiser

he
should

have
heard
a
philologist
trace
a
little
oxford
phrase
to
the
thieves
of
manchester
a
century
ago
or
more
now
he
plans
profound
or
witty
speeches
for
the
union
devises
rags
and
rebellions
and
writes
for
the
undergraduate
magazines
and
has
his
revenge
in
a
few
words
upon
coaches
dons
captains
of
football
and
all
forms
of
pomposity
dulness
and
good
sense
says
one
is
nonsense

he
luxuriates
in
the
criticism
of
life
and
blossoms
with
epigrams
he
says
in
his
heart
in
much
wisdom
is
much
grief
and
he
that
increaseth
knowledge
increaseth
sorrow
and
sets
himself
to
make
sayings
which
if
not
truer
than
proverbs
are
funnier

go
through
that
promiscuous
calling

of

seem
to
live
by
this
kind
of
canvassing
thieves
of
others

and
generous
givers
of
their
own
they
will
boast
of
having
taken
twenty
teas
in
one
afternoon
but
on
sunday
comes
their
judgment
they
wear
a
soberer
aspect
on
their
way
to
the
of
oxford
hostesses
in
the
comfortable
chairs
sit
the
incurable
habituÃ©s
cold
saturnine
spectators
or
impudent
epigrammatists
handing
round
at
regular
intervals
neat
slices
from
the
massy
joints
of
their
erudition
or
their
wit
they
smile
sadly
and
yet
complacently
over
their
as
the
prowler
enters
they
wait
until
the
victim
is
in
right
position
viz
with
a
perfectly
true
remark
about
the
weather
or
sunday
or
sport
or
dentists
and
then
suddenly
slit
the
life
with
an
unseasonable
query
or
corroboration
the
hostess
smiles
imperceptibly
in
a
few
moments
the
prowler
is
gone
mr
says
the
hostess
you
pronounce
the
sweetest
obituaries
i
ever
meet
but
i
have
never
known
you
to
pronounce
them
over
the
here
glow
the
lamps
and
teaspoons
clatter
to
the
cosy
hum
of
scientific
circles
here
resounds
the
football
field
with
its
discordant
train
the
crowd
that
cheers
but
not
discriminates
there
are
also
teas
with
the
young
the
beautiful
and
the
virtuous
in
the
plain
and
exclusive
northernmost
haunts
of
learning
in
oxford
the
university
could
not
well
do
without
their
sweet
influences
yet
if
men
in
their
company
are
often
better
than
themselves
as
is
only
right
they
are
perhaps
less
than
themselves
also
in
wit
carnivals
it
is
permitted
to
women
to
use
all
kinds
of
weapons
from
a
sigh
to
a
to
men
they
are
not
permitted
although
they
have
nothing
sharper
or
more
rankling
in
their
armoury
hence
on
the
part
of
generous
women
a
sort
of
pity
and
on
the
part
of
men
some
timidity
and
short
of
rudeness
tergiversation
and
i
am
not
privileged
to
give
an
account
of
a
real
somerville
tea
but
it
is
a
thing
impossible
to
praise
in
rhyme
or
prose
the
pleasures
of
tea
at
oxford
perhaps
especially
in
autumn
as
the
sun
is
setting
after
rain
when
a
man
knows
not
whether
it
is
pleasanter
to
be
rained
upon
at
cumnor
or
to
be
dried
again
by
his
fire
and
the
bells
are
ringing
not
that
nepenthes
which
the
wife
of
thone
in
egypt
gave
to
helena
is
of
such
power
to
stir
up
joy
as
this
to
life
so
friendly
perhaps
as
you
light
candles
and
ask
what
is
warmth
without
light
your
companion
replies
a
minor
poet
and
when
you
ask
again
in
irritation
what
is
light
without
warmth
he
is
ready
with
an
edition
of
tennyson
with
and
not
even
the
recollection
of
such
things
and
worse
can
spoil
the
charm
of
oxford
tea
then
it
is
that
the
homeliness
of
oxford
is
dearest
and
what
a
carnival
of
contrasts
in
men
and
manners
can
be
seen
in
a
little
room
oxford
writes
the
oxford
is
a
stage
and
all
the
men
in
residence
are
players
they
have
their
exeats
and
examinations
and
one
man
in
his
time
plays
many
parts
his
acts
being
seven
ages
at
first
the
freshman
stumbling
and
stuttering
in
his
tutor
s
rooms
and
then
the
aspiring
classman
with
white
tie
and
shy
desponding
face
creeping
along
unwilling
to
the
schools
then
at
the
union
spouting
like
fury
with
some
woeful
twaddle
upon
the
then
a
full
of
strange
oaths
a
keen
and
cunning
card
clever
in
cannons
sudden
and
quick
at
hazards
seeking
a
billiard
reputation
even
in
the
pocket
s
mouth
and
then
the
fellow
his
fair
round
forehead
with
hard
furrows
lined
with
weakened
eyes
and
beard
of
doubtful
growth
crammed
with
old
lore
of
useless
application
and
so
he
plays
his
part
the
sixth
age
shifts
into
the
lean
and
professor
with
spectacles
on
nose
and
class
at
side
his
youthful
nose
has
grown
a
world
too
large
for
his
shrunk
face
and
his
big
manly
voice
turning
again
towards
childish
treble
pipes
and
whistles
in
his
sound
last
scene
of
all
that
ends
this
strange
eventful
history
in
utter
donnishness
and
mere
nonentity
without
respect
or
tact
or
taste
or
anything
i
said
that
undergraduate
magazine
humour
was
a
flower
i
should
have
said
that
it
flowers
at
tea
and
is
harvested
after
dinner
the
penning
of
it
is
a
nocturnal
occupation
and
the
best
wit
is
sometimes
the
result
of
that
pregnant
nervousness
which
comes
from
competing
with
time
it
was
until
very
lately
illustration
the
sheldonian
theatre
and
old
clarendon
buildings
the
steps
from
cat
street
lead
to
the
enclosure
of
the

east
entrance
of
which
is
seen
above
the
entrance

the
roof
of

a
tradition
that
undergraduate
journalism
should
be
anonymous
of
many
good
and
feeble
things
the
authorship
will
now
probably
never
be
known
hath
the
rain
a
father
or
who
hath
begotten
the
drops
of
dew
and
it
is
an
odd
thing
that
so
few
reputations
have
been
promised
or
made
therein
probably
the
writers
of
the
cambridge
and
the
lambkin
papers
in
the
of
oxford
have
alone
not
only
shown
but
fulfilled
their
promise
in
contributions
to
an
undergraduate
periodical
the
explanation
is
that
the
cleverest
men
are
content
to
produce
either
parody
or
what
is
narrowly
topical
and
both
of
these
are
usually
born
in
their
graves
parody
said
a
don
is
always
with
us
and
nearly
always
against
parody
and
its
companions
are
in
fact
a
sort
of
unofficial
that
persecute
all
forms
of
bad
and
even
good
behaviour
which
do
not
come

strike
deep

not

king

shall
contentedly
wing
a
not
seldom
this
note
of
titanic
defiance
is
struck
by
the
freshman
himself
if
he
can
not
be
an
example
of
what
is
most
subtle
in
literature
or
most
brilliant
in
life
he
will
peacefully
consent
to
be
in
his
own
person
a
warning
against
the
commonplace
he
is
indeed
very
often
among
the
parodists
although
as
a
rule
he
does
not
get
beyond
imitation
perhaps
the
large
percentage
of
parodists
will
account
for
that
timidity
of
poets
which
has
left
cambridge
almost
without
a
tribute
from
its
countless
band
the
gay
sarcastic
man
who
dines
next
to
you
or
is
a
at
the
union
is
bound
to
hear
of
your
serious
follies
in
print
and
will
as
infallibly
make
that
an
excuse
for
rushing
into
print
himself
i
have
even
heard
it
seriously
urged
that
the
number
of
critics
in
oxford
accounts
for
the
silence
of
nearly
every
one
else
and
that
not
the
irresponsible
undergraduate
alone
blasts
the
blossoms
of
wisdom
while
he
takes
the
sting
out
of
foolishness
a
cautious
use
of
high
teas
might
be
recommended
as
a
step
towards
seriousness
some
even
fly
speedily
from
tea
to
work
upon
others
and
in
some
degree
upon
these
dinner
lays
a
cheerful
hand
in
anticipation
the
optimist
becomes
happier
and
wiser
the
very
pessimist
rises
at
least
to
a
cynic
under
the
head
of
dinner
i
include
first
and
least
the
discussion
of
the
cook
s
poetry
and
prose
if
one
may
be
permitted
to
make
the
distinction

his
joints
have
been
called

the

third
those
acts
of
pleasure
or
duty
which
came
naturally
to
the
wise
diner
the
first
two
are
hardly
distinct
acts
we
says
leigh
hunt
wit
and
argument
and
a
turkey
and
the
word
dinner
was
once
derived
from
the
greek
word
for
terrible
and
was
held
to
imply
not
so
much
its
terrors
for
the
speaker
as
for
the
man
who
came
simply
to
eat
most
oxford
colleges
have
accordingly
an
elaborate
and
forcible
set
of
rules
for
humiliating
the
sordid
man
in
old
days
he
apparently
quoted
from
the
bible
which
every
one
knew
just
as
every
one
knows
the
and
consequently
a
quotation
from
the
bible
was
punished
along
with
puns
quotations
from
latin
and
greek
and
oaths
as
unbecoming
to
a
feast
of
reason
flannels
and
other
clothes
belonging
to
the
barbaric
hours
of
life
are
forbidden
the
unpunctuality
of
such
as
obviously
come
only
to
devour
is
treated
in
the
same
way
gross
inadvertence
or
apparent
physical
incapacity
to
do
anything
but
eat
have
also
been
punished
in
gentlemen
both
punctual
and
suitably
clothed
but
these
and
other
excesses
of
virtuous
intention
are
not
always
sanctioned
by
the
high
table
the
punishment
usually
takes
the
form
of
a
fine
to
the
extent
of
two
quarts
of
beer
which
the
sufferer
has
to
put
in
circulation
among
his
judges
punning
too
is
attacked
it
was
time
that
the
pun
should
go
it
was
becoming
too
perfect
and
a
monopoly
of
the
mathematical
mind
two
hundred
years
ago
men
laughed
at
this
a
chaplain
in
the
university
of
oxford
having
one
leg
bigger
than
the
other
was
told
that
his
legs
might
be
too
for
they
were
never
like
to
be
it
is
doubtful
whether
it
would
be
honoured
by
the
fine
or
yet
the
pun
has
in
a
sense
been
supplanted
not
very
worthily
by
the
that
too
has
become
a
very
solemn
affair
it
is
in
the
hands
of
calculating
prodigies
and
men
are
expected
to
laugh
at
pictures
defeated
instead
of
features
depicted
and
the
like
it
smacks
of
the
logic
required
for
a
pass
degree
while
the
old
puns
plus
le
vin
que
l
yet
the
spoonerism
is
venerable
in
years
and
anthony
wood
records
among
his
pieces
of
humour
the
saying
of
ratcliff
of
brasenose
that
a
proud
man
will
buy
a
dagger
or
die
a
nor
is
the
anecdote
extinct
as
one
may
learn
from
the
laughter
at
any
high
table
where
it
is
known
that
men
do
not
discuss
ontology
oxford
humour
at
and
after
dinner
may
be
divided
under
these
heads
the
rag
the
epigram
humour
the
first
saving
when
it
amounts
to
or
assault
or
should
endanger
the
perpetrator
under
the
last
licensing
act
consists
in
the
thoughtful
preparation
and
execution
of
something
unexpected
for
the
benefit
of
an
offending
person
or
in
the
elaboration
of
something
visibly
and
audibly
funny
for
fun
s
sake
at
the
expense
of
the
artists
alone
it
was
a
rag
for
example
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
ago
as
also
more
recently
to
make
a
various
and
crowded
ceremony
of
the
enforced
exit
of
a
popular
undergraduate
the
hero
may
be
mounted
on
a
hearse
or
a
and
proceed
with
stately
accompaniment
or
he
may
go
in
pink
with
a
pack
of
and
whips
dressed
as
proctors
to
the
tune
of
the
conquering
some
prefer
if
obtainable
but
the
rag
is
a
branch
of
decorative
art
that
deserves
a
volume
with
illustrations
no
one
who
has
not
studied
it
can
guess
at
the
beautiful
work
which
is
devoted
to
the
conversion
of
a
gentleman
s
bedroom
into
a
any
one
who
would
teach
us
how
divine
a
thing
the
rag
can
be
made
would
be
heartily
thanked
i
may
remark
in
passing
that
it
gives
full
play
to
the
intellect
is
in
fact
a
counterpart
to
the
occupations
of
the
schoolmen
and
is
neither
less
practical
nor
less
ingenious
and
reaches
its
highest
perfection
in
the
hands
of
scholars
who
can
do
nothing
without
remembering
plato
and
say
nothing
without
remembering
aristophanes
lest
i
should
be
suspected
of
not
being
on
the
side
of
the
angels
in
recent
controversy
i
will
give
no
examples
save
a
trifling
one
which
has
just
been
recalled
for
me
by
a
volume
of
hazlitt
we
made
a
supper
party
of
six
with
corydon
our
host
at
in
oxford
his
gestures
particularly
a
gracious
way
of
bowing
his
head
as
he
smiled
had
a
magic
that
quickly
made
our
number
seem
inevitable
and
right
very
soon
all
were
talking
eagerly
in
harmonious
alternation
a
choicely
laden
board
of
cold
viands
which
none
seemed
to
have
noticed
stood
unvisited
and
was
finally
cleared
corydon
was
speaking
of
nothing
in
the
least
important
when
the
servant
carried
in
a
strange
but
dainty
course
of
little
fine
old
books
that
sent
the
conversation
happily
into
every
nook
that
rivers
from
helicon
visit
again
and
again
came
in
dishes
of
the
same
character
for
which
corydon
s
purse
and
library
had
been
ransacked
the
wealth
of
how
many
provinces
to
use
an
honoured
phrase
had
gone
to
the
preparation
of
that
meal
and
by
the
way
i
have
some
cold
fowls
and
wine
and
fruit
ready
the
host
said
suddenly
one
found
that
shelley
and
champagne
were
good
bosom
friends
another
that
a
compÃ´te
of
port
montaigne
and
pomegranate
was
incomparable
this
hazlitt
also
was
at
that
excellent
supper
and
nor
can
i
omit
a
mention
of
the
strong
sculptor
who
strove
all
night
in
the
midst
of
a
wintry
quadrangle
in
order
to
astonish
the
college
with
a
snow
statue
of
the
most
jovial
fellow
of
the
society
with
a
cigar
between
his
teeth
and
a
bottle
in
each
hand
godley
has
sung
of
a
more
boisterous
rag
the
raid
the
saxon
made
on
the
cymru
men
which
was
in
this
way
mist
upon
the
marches
lay
dark
the
night
and
late
came
the
bands
of
saxondom
knocking
at
a
gate
jones
the
person
was
whom
they
came
to
see
he
they
said
had
courteously
asked
them
in
to
tea
did
they
when
that
college
gate
open
wide
was
thrown
go
and
see
the
gentleman
as
they
should
have
done
no
in
impropriety
s
indecorous
tones
quite
unmeet
for
loud
they
shouted
jones
straightway
did
a
multitude
answer
to
their
call
dau
tri
pedwar
pump
joneses
all
loud
as
lliwedd
s
echoes
ring
all
asserted
we
never
asked
these
roistering
saesnegs
in
to
tea
like
the
waves
of
anglesey
crashing
on
the
coast
came
the
cymru
cohorts
then
countless
was
their
host
retribution
stern
and
swift
evermore
assails
him
who
dares
to
trifle
with
gallant
little
wales
one
who
might
be
supposed
to
know
said
in
that
where
a
cambridge
man
would
know
an
article
from
the
by
heart
an
oxford
man
would
abridge
it
in
an
epigram
and
there
he
contended
was
a
difference
and
a
distinction
but
the
epigram
is
said
to
be
dying
it
were
greatly
to
be
regretted
if
that
were
true
since
the
epigram
was
the
handsomest
medium
ever
chosen
by
inexperience
for
its
own
expression
as
poetry
is
a
criticism
of
life
by
livers
so
the
epigram
is
a
criticism
of
life
by
those
who
have
not
lived
it
used
to
be
the
toga
of
the
infant
prodigy
at
oxford
if
only
life
were
a
dream
and
i
could
afford
hansoms
or
a
little
jowett
is
a
dangerous
thing
used
to
pass
muster
in
a
crowd
of
epigrams
but
i
seemed
to
see
the
skirt
of
the
departing
epigram
this
year
when
a
young
man
exclaimed
that
he
had
discovered
that
after
all
life
is
the
thing
in
a
discussion
concerning
conduct
and
literature
and
the
shock
was
hardly
lessened
by
the
critical
repartee
that
the
remark
was
not
only
true
but
a
few
years
ago
smaller
notions
than
that
were
not
allowed
to
go
into
the
world
without
their
fashionable
suit
that
was
the
epigram
it
was
a
verbal
parallel
to
legerdemain
the
quickness
of
the
fancy
deceived
the
brain
or
rather
the
brain
made
it
a
point
of
courtesy
to
be
deceived
for
there
was
a
kindly
conspiracy
between
the
speaker
and
the
hearer
in
the
matter
of
epigrams
a
certain
degree
of
skill
was
expected
of
the
latter
who
knew
almost
infallibly
whether
a
saying
was
an
epigram
just
as
he
would
have
known
a
hearse
or
a
skiff
it
was
the
jingling
bell
which
every
one
but
the
exceptionally
clever
wore
in
his
cap
to
prove
that
he
aspired
to
talk
all
were
epigrammatists
and
regarded
as
alien
nothing
epigrammatical
when
lady
windermere
s
fan
was
played
at
oxford
even
those
who
had
not
heard
them
before
laughed
at
the
epigrams
in
the
club
scene
one
such
remarked
to
a
persevering
imitator
of
wilde
the
epigrams
in
lady
windermere
were
a
faint
echo
of
but
these
are
other
times
and
when
the
same
youth
bald
and
still
young
very
recently
ventured
to
clothe
a
little
truism
archaically
the
curate
next
to
him
touched
a
note
of
horror
mingled
with
contempt
as
he
said
that
sounded
like
an
in
one
respect
an
oxford
dinner
is
the
better
for
the
absence
of
epigram
the
article
is
impossible
it
used
to
be
as
ineffectual
as
the
prayers
of
thibet
a
man
might
be
seen
forgetful
of
the
world
nursing
his
faculties
from
soup
to
ice
in
the
gestation
of
an
epigram
thus
it
tended
to
cast
a
shadow
over
conversation
and
to
replace
the
genial
slow
and
alternations
of
good
talk
with
the
sudden
follies
of
snap
or
the
violences
of
bridge
breakfast
itself
was
sometimes
made
the
occasion
of
duels
with
a
thrust
and
parry
not
oftener
than
twice
in
a
course
a
man
would
come
melancholy
to
luncheon
because
he
had
not
hit
upon
a
good
thing
in
the
lecture
which
preceded
it
nevertheless
there
was
something
to
be
said
for
the
manufacture
if
not
for
the
manufacturer
his
epigrams
could
be
repeated
by
another
thus
an
elderly
morose
undergraduate
unable
to
knot
a
bow
would
one
day
ejaculate
at
the
wrong
moment
a
woman
is
never
too
stupid
to
be
loved
nor
too
clever
to
the
next
evening
a
simple
and
dashing
boy
would
make
a
hit
with
it
by
nice
judgment
of
time
and
place
much
applause
was
sometimes
accorded
to
the
wit
of
laborious
obscure
young
men
who
were
content
to
father
their
offspring
upon
the
illustrious
thus
one
undergraduate
was
once
found
slaving
at
an
original
work
entitled
addenda
to
the
posthumous
humour
of
the
late
master
of
of
humour
the
third
division
there
is
nothing
to
be
said
it
has
been
met
with
at
the
union
in
spite
of
the
notice
lost
a
sense
of
humour
by
the
following
gentlemen
they
will
take
in
exchange
early
numbers
of
and
or
a
selection
of
hatbands
for
the
most
part
the
heavier
vices
and
lighter
virtues
of
speech
are
said
to
flourish
there
it
is
a
pity
said
a
critic
of
the
union
that
so
many
ingenious
youths
should
disarm
themselves
by
pretending
to
be
in
the
house
of
commons
which
they
rival
as
a
a
frenchman
has
said
that
its
histrionic
wealth
at
one
time
equalled
the
house
of
moliÃ¨re
indeed
as
a
home
of
comedy
it
is
the
most
amusing
and
accomplished
in
oxford
and
on
that
account
probably
the
public
theatre
seldom
provides
anything
but
opera
and
farce
a
bland
clever
youth
stooping
like
a
candle
in
hot
july
his
body
and
a
scroll
of
foolscap
quivering
with
emotion
as
he
suggests
to
a
smiling
house
that
the
conservative
party
should
bury
its
differences
under
the
sole
management
of
redmond
a
stiff
small
heroic
figure
with
a
mouth
that
might
sway
armies
a
voice
as
sweet
as
helicon
as
irresistible
and
continuous
as
niagara
pouring
forth
praise
of
the
english
aristocracy
and
the
independent
labour
party
to
a
house
that
believes
or
disbelieves
and
applauds
a
minute
tormented
skeleton
acrobatic
and
ungainly
so
eloquent
on
the
futility
of
parliament
that
he
might
govern
the
empire
if
he
could
govern
himself
one
who
is
not
really
comfortable
without
a
cigarette
yet
awes
the
house
by
his
superb
complacency
as
he
utters
now
and
then
a
languid
epigram
about
the
irish
peasantry
or
indigo
in
the
brief
intervals
of
an
apparent
colloquy
with
himself
these
and
a
multitude
of
the
fervid
the
weighty
the
listless
the
perky
and
the
dull
are
among
the
union
orators
of
yesterday
i
went
to
the
union
to
be
amused
says
one
they
were
debating
a
question
of
literature
a
brilliant
man
opened
a
learned
opposed
others
followed
some
for
some
against
the
motion
others
again
made
observations
i
was
not
disappointed
i
was
edified
there
was
no
research
there
was
little
originality
but
there
was
a
dazzling
simplicity
and
lucidity
and
an
extraordinary
power
of
treating
controversially
the
profoundest
matters
as
if
they
were
common
knowledge
above
all
the
reserved
gestures
the
were
dignified
and
made
me
believe
that
i
was
listening
to
the
opinions
of
an
assembly
of
men
of
the
world
and
not
a
handful
of
students
not
yet
past
their
but
the
glories
of
union
oratory
are
weekly
the
theatre
is
consequently
a
favourite
evening
lounge
some
even
prefer
it
on
thursdays
it
is
noticeable
that
the
house
is
more
familiar
than
elsewhere
in
its
praise
or
disapproval
of
the
players
half
a
dozen
in
the
dress
circle
will
hold
a
rather
conversation
with
the
stage
for
half
an
evening
it
is
also
customary
and
especially
on
saturdays
for
the
audience
to
sing
the
choruses
of
songs
to
their
taste
many
times
over
and
then
to
revive
them
in
the
quiet
streets
banquets
and
the
reception
given
to
the
speeches
of
actors
and
managers
and
the
nature
of
those
speeches
as
well
prove
the
hearty
fellowship
between
university
and
stage
it
has
long
been
so
at
a
stage
play
in
oxford
says
one
old
author
at
the
king
s
arms
in
holywell
a
cornishman
was
brought
in
to
wrestle
with
three
welshmen
one
after
another
and
when
he
had
worsted
them
all
he
called
out
as
his
part
was
have
you
any
more
welshmen
which
words
one
of
jesus
college
took
in
such
indignation
that
he
leaped
upon
the
stage
and
threw
the
player
in
it
must
be
admitted
however
that
such
familiarities
on
the
stage
itself
are
now
unknown
to
a
stranger
walking
from
the
union
or
the
theatre
after
tom
has
sounded
the
ideal
hour
of
studious
retirement
oxford
might
well
appear
to
be
a
nest
of
singing
birds
the
windows
of
brilliantly
lighted
rooms
with
curtains
frequently
undrawn
in
or
college
reveal
rows
of
backs
and
rows
of
faces
with
here
one
at
a
piano
and
there
one
standing
beside
singing
lustily
while
the
rest
try
with
more
or
less
success
to
concentrate
their
talents
upon
the
chorus
probably
they
are
singing
something
from
scarlet
and
or
other
for
students
soldiers
and
sailors
or
it
may
be
a
folk
song
that
has
never
come
into
print
sometimes
in
the
later
evening
the
singing
is
not
so
beautiful
for
here
those
sing
who
never
sang
before
and
those
who
used
to
sing
now
sing
the
more
perhaps
only
the
lover
of
grotesque
contrasts
will
care
for
the
ballads
flung
to
the
brightening
moon
among
the

and

the

are

lang

until
the
college
is
quiet
and
but
rarely
a
light
is

through

over

and
the
long
oxford
night
begins
we
build
up
the
fire
if
it
be
autumn
we
will
hardly
permit
it
ever
to
go
out
thus
consoling
ourselves
for
the
transitory
glow
of
the
sun
and
fantastically
handing
on
the
sunsets
of
many
summers
and
the
dawns
of
many
springs
in
that
constant
flame
sitting
before
it
we
seem
to
evolve
a
fiery
myth
and
think
that
apollo
and
arthur
and
other
solar
heroes

probably
leapt
radiant
from
just
such
a
fire

the

of

light
creeps
along
the

are
silently
preluding
to
a
second
spring
when
poets
shall
sing
instead
of

and
we
shall
gather
old
fragrant
flowers
not
from
groves

from
books
we
see
coming
a
long
new
summer
a
bookish
summer
when
we
shall
rest
by

not
leave
our

of

than
the

amidst
the
last
chapter
of
the

while
the

is
crumbling
grey
and
murmurous
as
if
it

in

about

that

a
joyous

to
a

falling

in

garden
chapter
vii
in
a
college
garden
in
spring
when
it
rained
says
aubrey
lord
bacon
used
to
go
into
the
fields
in
an
open
coach
to
receive
the
benefit
of
irrigation
which
he
was
wont
to
say
was
very
wholesome
because
of
the
nitre
in
the
aire
and
the
universal
spirit
of
the
nor
is
it
difficult
in
a
college
garden
to
associate
the
diverse
ceremonial
of
nature
with
the
moods
and
great
days
of
men
what
for
example
can
lay
such
fostering
hands
upon
the
spirit
that
has
grown
callous
in
the
undecipherable
sound
of
cities
as
the
grey
february
clouds
that
emerge
from
the
sky
hardly
more
than
the
lines
in
or
the
grain
of
a
chestnut
i
have
thought
in
that
garden
that
we
are
neglectful
of
the
powers
of
herb
and
flower
to
educate
the
soul
and
that
the
magical
herbalists
were
nobly
guessing
at
difficult
truths
when
they
strove
to
find
a
virtue
in
every
product
of
lawn
and
sedge
there
is
a
polarity
between
the
genius
of
certain
places
and
certain
temperaments
our
genial
air
or
natal
atmosphere
is
we
may
think
enriched
by
the
soul
of
innumerable
plants
beyond
the
neighbourhood
of
which
some
people
are
never
quite
and
this
college
garden
of
smooth
shining
lawn
and
trees
that
seem
more
than
trees
in
their
close
old
friendship
with
grey
masonry
has
a
singular
aptness
to
i
had
almost
said
a
singular
knowledge
of
those
who
have
first
been
aware
of
beauty
in
its
shade
if
there
be
aught
in
heredity
i
must
perforce
love
gardens
and
until
the
topographer
of
eden
shall
arise
i
have
set
my
heart
on
so
says
a
theologian
one
of
its
adornments
in
academic
black
and
white
old
and
storied
as
it
is
the
garden
has
a
whole
volume
of
subtleties
by
which
it
avails
itself
of
the
tricks
of
the
elements
nothing
could
be
more
romantic
than
its
grouping
and
contrasted
lights
when
a
great
tawny
september
moon
leans
as
if
pensively
at
watch
upon
the
garden
wall
no
garden
is
so
fortunate
in
retaining
its
splendour
when
summer
brusquely
departs
or
so
rich
in
the
idiom
of
green
leaves
when
the
dewy
charities
of
the
south
wind
are
at
last
accepted
none
so
happily
assists
the
music
and
laughter
and
lamps
of
some
festivity
and
when
in
february
the
heavy
rain
bubbles
at
the
foot
of
the
trees
and
spins
a
shifting
veil
about
their
height
and
over
the
grass
it
seems
to
reveal
more
than
it
conceals
the
loneliness
of
the
place
becomes
intense
as
if
one
were
hidden
far
back
in
time
and
one
s
self
an
anachronism
it
is
a
return
to
nature
the
whole
becomes
primeval
and
it
is
hard
to
throw
off
the
illusion
of
being
deep
in
woods
and
in
some
potent
presence

the
portion
of
this
garden
shown
is
bounded
by
the
portion
of
the
old
city
wall
with
one
or
two
bastions
still
remaining
and
the

formed
on
a

level
with
the

casual
stranger
sees
little
in
the

but
neatness
and
repose
he
may
notice
how
luckily
the
few

occur
and
what
warmth
the
shrubbery
bestows
when
they
are
black
with
rain
and
the

are
spilt
in
silence
in
a
little
while
he
may
be
privileged
to
learn
what
a
great
space
for
the
eye
and
especially
for
the
imagination
the
unknown
gardener
has
contrived
out
of
a
few
roods
of
grass
he
will
perhaps
end
by
remarking
that
an
acre
is
more
than
so
many
square
yards
and
by
supposing
that
it
is
unique
because
it
is
academic
but
it
is
no
merely
academic
charm
that
keeps
him
there
whether
the
sun
in
october
is
so
bright
on
the
frosty
grass
that
the
dead
leaves
disappear
when
they
fall
or
on
a
spring
evening
the
great
chestnut
expands
its
beauty
and
magnitude
are
as
things
newly
and
triumphantly
acquired
and
it
fills
the
whole
space
of
sky
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
constellations
hang
in
its
branches
it
is
rather
perfect
than
academic
a
garden
of
which
the
most
would
say
that
after
their
own
it
is
the
best
its
shape
and
size
are
accidents
for
it
embraces
the
sites
of
an
old
hall
a
graveyard
and
an
orchard
of
elizabeth
s
time
and
the
expert
mole
might
here
and
there
discover
traces
of
a
dozen
successive
fashions
since
it
was
clipped
and
carved
by
a
dialist
and
peppered
with
tulips
but
a
thoughtful
conservatism
and
a
partnership
between
many
generations
have
given
it
an
indubitable
style
the
place
has
as
it
were
a
nationality
and
the
inevitable
boundaries
are
apparently
the
of
the
picture
and
not
its
aboriginal
frame
yet
it
is
no
natural
garden
into
which
any
one
may
stroll
and
scatter
the
ends
of
cigarettes
a
strong
customary
law
is
expressed
by
the
very
aspect
of
the
place
hence
part
of
it
is
still
sacred
to
the
statelier
leisure
of
the
dons
hence
where
any
one
can
go
whether
by
right
or
from
a
lack
of
beadles
it
is
the
good
fortune
of
every
one
to
find
himself
alone
when
he
reaches
the
spot
even
so
the
trees
have
never
quite
their
just
tribute
of
dignity
and
ceremonial
they
would
be
pleased
to
welcome
back
the
days
when
shenstone
could
only
visit
jago
secretly
because
he
wore
a
servitor
s
gown
when
even
gibbon
remembered
with
satisfaction
the
velvet
cap
and
silk
gown
which
distinguish
a
gentleman
commoner
from
a
plebeian
student
and
when
within
living
memory
the
correct
thing
for
the
quiet
gentlemanly
undergraduate
was
a
black
and
tall
hat
with
the
neatest
of
gloves
and
boots
on
his
country
walk
the
garden
when
its
borders
were
in
scrolls
knots
and
volutes
was
certainly
not
among
the
less
ambitious
pleasures
found
beneath
the
of
an
humble
bob
but
was
chiefly
honoured
by
those
who
had
graduated
into
a
grizzled
wig
with
feathery
pride
rakewell
of
queen
s
or
beau
trifle
of
christ
church
or
the
ornate
gentleman
who
are
depicted
in
ackerman
and
by
dons
who
had
never
lost
their
by
the
scandal
of
keeping
the
company
of
undergraduates
when
latin
was
the
language
of
conversation
at
dinner
and
supper
the
trees
looked
their
best
the
change
came
perhaps
in
the
days
of
the
president
who
went
about
the
world
muttering
omnibus
or
when
our
grandfathers
made
the
gravel
shriek
with
their
armchair
races
across
the
quadrangles
for
in
those
days
according
to
an
authority
on
roses
undergraduates
either
read
or
hunted
or
drove
or
rowed
or
walked
up
and
down
the
high
the
pile
of
the
lawn
continued
to
deepen
and
the
trees
to
write
new
legends
upon
the
sky
the
limes
are
in
number
equal
to
the
fellows
of
the
college
and
with
the
great
warden
and
the
lesser
trees
make
up
a
solemn
and
wise
society
they
waste
no
time
now
and
then
they
talk
a
little
and
when
one
talks
the
others
follow
but
as
a
rule
the
wryneck
or
the
jackdaw
talks
instead
and
with
them
it
seems
to
be
near
the
end
of
the
day
nothing
remaining
save
in
the
angriest
gale
and
in
the
scarcely
air
of
twilight
the
cypresses
nod
almost
without
sound
they
are
sentinels
unarmed
powerful
in
their
unknown
watchword
solemn
and
important
as
negroes
born
in
the
days
of
haroun
alraschid
they
say
the
last
word
on
calm
and
so
old
goes
there
often
to
remember
the
great
days
of
the
college
fifty
years
ago
and
looking
with
his
natural
tonsure
and
black
long
gown
seems
to
worship
some
unpermitted
graven
image
among
the
shadows
when
is
in
the
garden
the
intruder
may
see
a
complete
piece
of
mediÃ¦val
oxford
for
the
louvre
and
the
line
of
roofs
and
the
mullioned
windows
are
from
that
point
of
view
as
they
were
in
the
founder
s
time
at
the
feet
of
the
trees
are
the
flowers
of
the
seasons
in
their
order
here
and
there
the
precious
dark
earth
is
visible
adding
a
charm
to
the
pale
green
stems
and
leaves
and
the
splendid
or
thoughtful
hues
of
blossom
the
flower
borders
and
plots
carve
the
turf
into
such
a
shape
that
it
seems
a
great
quiet
monster
at
rest
one
step
ahead
the
grass
is
undivided
enamelled
turf
underfoot
the
innumerable
blades
have
each
a
colour
a
movement
a
fragrance
of
their
own
as
when
one
enters
a
crowd
that
had
seemed
merely
a
crowd
and
finds
in
it
no
two
alike
on
one
side
is
the
shrubbery
of
all
the
hues
of
the
kingdom
of
green
underneath
the
shrubs
the
gloom
is
a
presence
the
interlacing
branches
are
as
the
bars
of
its
cage
you
watch
and
watch
like
children
who
have
found
the
lion
s
cage
but
the
lion
invisible
until
gradually
pleased
and
still
awed
you
see
that
the
caged
thing
is
nothingness
in
all
its
shadowy
pomp
and
immeasurable
power
seated
there
you
could
swear
that
the
darkness
was
moving
about
treading
the
boundaries
when
i
first
saw
it
it
was
a
thing
as
new
and
strange
as
if
i
had
seen
the
world
before
the
sun
and
withdrawing
my
eyes
and
looking
at
the
fresh
limes
illustration
in
trinity
college
gardens
the
gates
supported
by
noble
piers
to
the
left
of
the
picture
open
immediately
opposite
wadham
college
the
road
between
the
college
and
the
gates
leads
to
the
new
museum
the
parks
and
keble
college
there
is
no
entrance
for
the
public
through
these
gates
some
of
the
fine
trees
which
adorn
this
eastern
part
of
the
gardens
are
shown
was
like
beholding
the
light
of
the
first
dawn
arriving
at
eden
and
in
the
evening
that
accumulated
gloom
raised
the
whole
question
between
silence
and
speech
and
did
not
answer
it
the
song
of
the
blackbird
is
heard
cushioned
among
the
sleepy
cooings
of
doves
and
when
they
cease
how
fine
is
the
silence
when
they
revive
how
fine
is
the
song
for
the
silence
seems
to
appropriate
and
not
to
destroy
the
song
the
blackbird
too
seems
to
appropriate
and
make
much
of
the
silence
when
he
sings
the
long
meditations
of
the
gowned
and
ungowned
therein
are
not
of
less
account
because
the
only
tangible
result
is
the
perfect
beheading
of
dandelions
as
they
walk
to
and
fro
how
shall
i
name
you
immortal
mild
proud
shadows
i
only
know
that
all
we
know
comes
from
you
and
that
you
come
from
eden
on
flying
feet
is
eden
far
away
or
do
you
hide
from
human
thought
as
hares
and
mice
and
coneys
that
run
before
the
and
lie
in
the
last
ridge
of
the
barley
do
our
woods
and
winds
and
ponds
cover
more
quiet
woods
more
shining
winds
more
ponds
is
eden
out
of
time
and
out
of
space
and
do
you
gather
about
us
when
pale
light
shining
on
water
and
fallen
among
leaves
and
winds
blowing
from
flowers
and
whirr
of
feathers
and
the
green
quiet
have
uplifted
the
heart
not
often
can
the
most
academic
dreamer
see
faunus
among
those
trees
or
daphne
in
the
laurel
again
on
the
grass
the
shadows
of
the
roof
and
later
of
a
tree
make
time
an
alluring
toy
the
shadow
is
cut
in
finer
and
sharper
angles
than
the
roofs
make
in
the
rich
hazy
oxford
light
to
walk
round
about
the
garden
twice
could
not
occupy
an
hour
of
the
most
tranquil
or
gouty
human
life
even
if
you
stayed
to
see
the
toadflaxes
and
ferns
in
the
wall
to
note
the
shape
of
the
trees
and
admire
how
the
changing
sun
patronises
space
after
space
of
the
college
buildings
yet
no
maze
or
boundless
moor
could
give
a
greater
pleasure
of
seclusion
and
security
not
in
vain
has
it
served
many
academic
generations
as
a
sweet
and
melodious
of
the
unseen
for
as
an
old
book
grows
the
richer
to
the
wise
reader
for
the
porings
of
its
dead
owners
in
past
years
so
these
trees
and
this
lawn
have
been
enriched
their
roots
are
deep
in
more
than
earth
their
crests
traffic
with
more
than
the
doves
and
the
blue
air
there
is
surely
no
other
garden
so
fit
to
accompany
the
reading
of
or
the
they
become
domesticated
in
the
heart
amidst
these
propitious
shades
but

old
oxford
days
chapter
viii
old
oxford
days
the
history
of
a
college
like
new
or
wadham
is
written
clearly
on
its
walls
it
rose
by
one
grand
effort
from
one
grand
conception
at
the
will
of
founder
and
architect
all
its
future
uses
were
more
or
less
plainly
implied
in
the
quadrangles
chapel
and
hall
through
which
the
opening
procession
marched
with
solemn
music
they
stood
in
need
of
little
more
than
time
and
good
fortune
such
a
college
was
then
in
a
sense
mature
fully
armed
and
equipped
before
the
founder
s
decease
but
it
was
more
characteristic
of
an
oxford
college
to
be
evolved
irregularly
by
strange
and
difficult
ways
with
much
sudden
expansion
and
decline
into
its
present
state
thus
lincoln
and
oriel
were
for
a
short
time
after
their
foundation
fallow
if
not
extinct
the
latter
in
spite
of
its
renovation
by
a
king
after
whom
it
was
at
first
inclined
to
be
named
grew
up
around
the
humble
illustrious
tenement
of
la
oriole
where
its
early
scholars
dwelt
and
whence
they
gave
their
society
its
lasting
name
that
cradling
tenement
has
its
parallel
in
many
a
college
history
in
the
thirteenth
or
fourteenth
century
some
oxford
citizen
would
build
a
pair
of
cottages
where
a
carpenter
and
an
innkeeper
came
to
live
at
the
inrush
of
students
to
welcome
a
famous
lecturer
the
spare
rooms
of
those
cottages
received
their
share
some
of
the
lodgers
stayed
on
liked
the
carpenter
and
his
wife
and
family
with
whom
they
lived
on
terms
of
social
equality
and
in
a
generation
the
tradition
of
entertaining
scholars
was
established
a
few
years
saw
the
formation
of
a
colony
of
students
from
one
countryside
or
great
estate
as
the
custom
was
they
chose
a
superior
from
among
their
number
in
those
days
if
an
american
had
run
upstairs
to
the
head
he
might
have
had
a
more
satisfactory
answer
than
he
had
yesterday
to
his
command
i
ve
come
to
take
rooms
in
your
college
for
the
hostel
was
roughly
speaking
an
hotel
the
members
fought
side
by
side
in
the
battles
of
the
nations
viz
northerners
southerners
etc
and
of
town
and
gown
they
bent
over
the
same
books
they
sang
the
same
songs
and
together
they
came
to
love
the
place
the
two
cottages
and
those
adjacent
into
which
they
had
overflowed
such
a
group
fled
from
the
ancient
brasenose
hall
to
stamford
in
one
of
the
university
migrations
in
carried
with
them
the
knocker
of
their
lodgings
in
the
shape
of
a
brazen
nose
and
fixed
it
to
the
door
of
their
brasenose
hall
in
if
they
forgot
to
take
it
back
on
their
return
it
nevertheless
got
perched
upon
the
top
of
the
pineal
gland
of
the
college
brain
and
with
characteristic
spirited
piety
the
descendants
of
the
old
found
it
out
in
and
hung
it
in
a
place
of
honour
and
safety
in
later
life
one
of
the
carpenter
s
tenants
became
a
bishop
or
a
royal
almoner
either
at
the
height
of
his
fame
and
wealth
or
on
his
deathbed
he
would
remember
his
old
retreat
and
its
associations
with
law
and
aristotle
and
breed
and
chese
and
good
ale
in
a
jubbe
there
his
old
friends
or
their
successors
still
dwelt
and
learned
and
taught
and
fought
so
he
gave
money
for
the
purchase
of
the
cottages
a
neighbouring
garden
plot
perhaps
a
strip
of
woodland
outside
the
walls
and
the
rents
of
some
home
farms
for
the
revenue
together
with
the
advowson
of
a
church
if
possible
the
one
which
he
remembered
best
in
oxford
or
if
not
then
one
within
his
diocese
or
influence
he
sketched
the
statutes
which
fixed
the
number
of
the
scholars
and
the
rules
for
electing
new
ones
and
a
head
he
himself
chose
the
first
head
the
scholars
were
to
remain
unmarried
and
in
residence
to
study
the
arts
or
theology
or
canon
and
civil
law
and
to
pray
for
his
soul
the
carpenter
s
and
innkeeper
s
tenants
found
themselves
suddenly
powerful
and
rich
they
had
their
own
seal
and
a
new
and
more
settled
enthusiasm
and
a
diapason
of
duties
and
ceremonies
added
to
their
life
they
had
their
aisle
in
the
church
whose
shadow
reached
them
on
summer
evenings
if
their
estates
were
large
and
well
managed
if
the
country
was
prosperous
and
the
head
obeyed
the
statutes
and
the
fellows
the
head
their
progress
was
swift
perhaps
a
legal
difficulty
interposed
delay
or
their
rents
disappeared
perhaps
the
fellows
quarrelled
with
the
head
or
the
discipline
was
such
that
the
fellows
climbed
into
college
at
late
unstatutable
hours
and
became
a
scandal
in
the
university
but
a
descendant
or
neighbour
of
the
founder
or
a
parishioner
of
the
college
living
came
to
their
help
one
gave
a
present
in
order
that
he
might
be
remembered
in
the
college
prayers
another
sent
books
a
former
fellow
who
was
grateful
or
pitiful
made
a
rich
benefaction
when
he
went
to
court
already
the
little
original
tenements
were
tottering
or
too
small
they
must
build
and
rebuild
then
a
second
founder
adopted
as
his
children
that
and
all
succeeding
generations
of
scholars
who
should
praise
him
for
a
benefaction
larger
than
the
first
they
pull
down
the
old
buildings
all
save
a
flanking
wall
with
a
gateway
to
their
taste
and
begin
to
build
the
benefactor
sends
teams
of
oxen
to
carry
wood
and

they
are
quarrying
at

in

proverbial
latin

in

at

as
important
as
the

race
they
were
a
subtle
measure
of
the
state
of
parties
and
movements
and
in
these
the
college
played
its
part
and
when
the
days

were
over
there
was
the

lampoon
these
paltry

supposed
to
be

alderman

rhime

the
college
was
busy
in
sending
out
into
the
world
of
church
and
state
its
more
vigorous
members
those
who
excelled
in
the
age
when
examinations
were
disputations
that
sometimes
became
almost
a

athletic
sport

in

the
quieter
spirits

were
willing

spend
a

in
the
education
and
discipline
of
others
from

from

to

living
were
frequently
made
the
very
calmest

no

the

stage
sometimes
led

sweetened
as
in

or
in
the

which
was
as

leading
into

of

to
sit

are
inconceivable
when
competition
and

remote
from

are
characteristic
of
oxford
sport
earlier
still
a
form
of
college
game
was
the
vile
and
horrid
sport
of
forcibly
shaving

who
were
about
to

the

customs
cast
but
a
feeble
shadow

the
occasional
solemnity
of
trimming
a
contemporary
s
exuberant

a
more
appropriate
form
of
celebrating
the
taking
of
degrees
was
an
elaborate

left
him
alone
when
he
became
better
than
other
people
as
a
singular
odd
fellow
at
pembroke
there
was
however
one
custom
which
must
have
left
such
men
with
a
sore
memory
for
the
fresh
night
was
long
the
common
doom
of
men
soon
after
entering
the

there
were
fires
of
charcoal
in

on

day
and
night
and
onwards
to

and
making
an

sooner
than
at

they
left
the

to
the
liberty
of
the

but
with
an
admonition
from
one
of
the

who
was
then
principal
of

at

that
all

after

was

from

was
brought
up
and
set
before
the

in

afterwards
every

according

seniority
was
to
pluck
off
his

after

to
the
high
table

there
made
to
stand
on
a
form
placed
thereon
from
whence
they
were
to
speak
their
speech
with
an
audible
voice
to
the
company
which
if
well
done
the
person
that
spoke
it
was
to
have
a
cup
of
caudle
and
no

indifferently
some

when

the

an
oath
over
an

spoken

the

kissed

on

it
please
your

croak

these
are
they
that
esteem
a
tavern
as
bad
as
purgatory
and

more
superstitious
than

water
and
therefore
i
hope
this
honourable
convocation
will
not
suffer
one
of
that
tribe
to
taste
of
the

should
be
troubled
with
a

at
such
a
special

as
that
the

bore
more
resemblance
than
our

to

elsewhere
the
fashions
in

and

were

and
well
it
might
for
otherwise
they
were
in
danger
of
dining
like
fighting
cocks
and
amusing
themselves
like
doves
the

for
example
were
permitted
no
games
but
ball
in
the
college
garden
examinations
are
still
a
select
and
expensive
form
of
amusement
the
stories
told
of
celebrated
men
and
their
conflicts
with
examiners
and
the
like
have
inspired
more
than
one
to
go
into
the
schools
in
a
mood
of
smiling
irreverence
the
fame
resulting
it
is
true
has
to
be
propagated
by
much
anecdote
from
the
lips
of
the
hero
himself
in
the
middle
ages
the
humour
was
of
a
lustier
kind
the
parsley
crown
went
or
should
have
gone
to
the
most
brazen
giver
and
taker
of
learned
wit
in
anthony
Ã 
wood
s
day
one
william
george
cynical
and
hirsute
in
his
behaviour
was
a
noted
sophister
and
disputant
and
improved
his
purse
by
preparing
the
exercises
of
the
dull
or
lazy
for
public
recitation
the
nature
of
these
examinations
in
their
dull
old
age
has
been
recorded
by
one
who
took
part
two
boys
or
men
as
they
call
themselves
agree
to
together
the
first
stage
in
this
mighty
work
is
to
produce
arguments
these
are
always
handed
down
from
generation
to
generation
on
long
slips
of
paper
and
consist
of
foolish
syllogisms
on
foolish
subjects
the
next
step
is
to
go
for
a
to
one
of
the
petty
officers
called
the
regent
master
of
the
schools
who
subscribes
his
name
to
the
questions
and
receives
sixpence
as
his
fee
when
the
important
day
arrives
the
two
doubty
disputants
go
into
a
large
dusty
room
full
of
dirt
and
cobwebs
with
walls
and
wainscot
decorated
with
the
names
of
former
disputants
who
to
divert
the
tedious
hours
cut
out
their
names
with
their
penknives
or
wrote
verses
with
a
pencil
here
they
sit
in
mean
desks
opposite
to
each
other
from
one
till
three
not
once
in
a
hundred
times
does
any
officer
enter
and
if
he
does
he
hears
one
syllogism
or
two
and
then
makes
a
bow
and
departs
as
he
came
and
remained
in
solemn
silence
the
disputants
then
return
to
the
amusement
of
cutting
the
desks
carving
their
names
or
reading
sterne
s
or
some
other
edifying
thus
towards
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
great
progress
is
made
towards
the
honour
of
a
bachelor
s
degree
the
goal
might
be
reached
if
the
undergraduate
knew
a
few
jolly
young
masters
of
arts
by
answering
questions
concerning
the
pedigree
of
a
such
was
the
lack
of
interest
in
the
disputations
that
they
were
called
wall
lectures
after
the
name
of
their
principal
auditor
a
little
poaching
gave
a
very
attractive
substitute
for
running
but
increasing
college
discipline
and
the
heightening
average
of
wealth
and
birth
among
students
cut
off
the
more
violent
sports
of
the
middle
ages
the
unattached
poor
welsh
and
irish
students
who
kept
up
the
university
name
for
rough
and
adventurous
relaxations
disappeared
before
the
reformation
and
after
the
poor
law
act
of
had
condemned
begging
scholars
who
were
not
authorised
under
the
seal
of
a
university
to
be
treated
as
beggars
there
can
have
been
few
to
poach
at
shotover
and
abingdon
the
masked
mohock
revels
and
jacobite
struttings
of
the
augustan
age
were
a
poor
alternative
the
blithe
and
fearless
spirit
of
trespassing
so
common
among
undergraduates
is
the
sole
survival
if
we
exclude
the
pious
uprooting
of
stakes
and
fences
on
fields
supposed
by
reference
to
doomsday
book
to
be
common
land
before
and
after
the
puritans
who
preferred
music
in
their
rooms
there
was
free
access
to
the
acting
of
dramas
in
latin
and
english
and
earlier
still
to

but
the
attitude

towards

two

was

wily
mixture

ferocity
the
was

in
his
reckless
bombardment
of

at

and
year

one
or
both
of
the

suffered
expulsion
or
like
addison
s

public
humiliation
for
their
scandalous
and
opprobrious
words
which
no
doubt
earned
the
gratitude
of
irresponsible

it
was
long
a

recreation
a
recreation
only
to
go
on

carries
with

many
memories
for

oxford
men
even
if

is
not

winter
afternoons
when
the

was

the

of

astonish

we

its
slopes
of

and
the
elmy
hills
of
cumnor

by
visions
of

spires

country
a
soul
even
when
the

is
out
of
sight
its
neighbourhood
is
not
to
be
put
by
everywhere
it
is
a
suspected
presence
a
hidden
melodist
whether
in
memory
or
anticipation
it
is
on
all
our
walks
like
some
grave
thought
threading
a
mighty
i
could
wish
that
an
inexorable
five
mile
act
had
kept
it
clear
of
red

at

i
know
not
how
to
describe
the
spirit
which
turns
a
few
miles
of
peaceful
southern
country
into
something
so
unique
but
if
i
mention
a
wood
or
a
stream
let
the
reader
paint
in
as
it
were
something
sweet
and
shadowy
in
the
distance
with
his
imagination
or
recollection
let
it
be
as
some
subtle
perfume
in
a
which
makes
it
different
from
all
others
there
is
a
beautiful
sloping
acre
not
far
from
oxford
which
a
number
of
great
elms
divide
into
aisles
and
nave
while
at
one
end
a
curving
hawthorn
and
maple
hedge
completes
them
with
an
apse
towards
oxford
the
space
is
almost
shut
in
by
remote
elms
on
one
side
i
hear
the
soft
and
sibilant
fall
of
soaking
grass
before
the
scythe
the
rain
and
sun
alternating
are
like
two
lovers
in
dialogue
the
rain
smiles
from
the
hills
when
the
sun
shines
and
the
sun
also
while
the
rain
is
falling
when
the
rain
is
not
over
and
the
sun
has
interrupted
the
nightingale
sings
where
the
stitchwort
is
starry
amidst
long
grass
that
bathes
the
sweeping
branches
of
thorn
and
brier
and
i
am
now
stabbed
and
now
caressed
by
its
changing
song
through
the
elms
on
either
side
hot
rank
grasses
rise
crowned
with
a
vapour
of
parsley
flowers
a
white
steam
from
the
soil
faintly
mists
the
grass
at
intervals
the
grass
and
elms
seem
to
be
suffering
in
the
rain
suffering
for
their
quietness
and
solitude
to
be
longing
for
something
as
perhaps
eden
also
dropped
some
natural
tears
when
left
a
void

potent
warm
and
not
quite
soothing
illustration
oxford
from
south
hinksey
elms
and
willow
trees
fringe
the
slope
of
the
hills

the
valley
in
which
the
city
shows
sparkling
in
the
morning

from
the
west

see
the

lantern
of

of

telling
dark
against

come

perfume
creeps
over

and
makes
the

blossom
something
elvish
i
turn
and
look
east
almost
at
once
all
these
things
are
happily
composed
into
one
pleasant
sense
and
are
but
a
frame
to
a
tower
and
three
spires
of
oxford
like
clouds
but
the
sky
is
suddenly
cloudless
i
suppose
that
ivy
has
the
same
graceful
ways
on
all
old
masonry
yet
i
have
caught
myself
remembering
as
if
it
were
unique
that
perfect
ancient
ivy
that
makes
an
arcade
of
green
along
the
wall
of
godstow
nunnery
and
in
the
same
way
above
all
others
i
remember
the
pollard
willows
that
lean
this
way
and
that
along
the
oxford
streams
like
prehistoric
sculpture
in
winter
but
in
summer
a
green
wave
and
full
of
voices
never
have
i
seen
sunsets
like
those
which
make
wytham
wood
and
marley
wood
great
purple
clouds
and
the
clouds
overhead
more
solid
than
they
how
pleasant
are
cherwell
and
evenlode
and
those
angry
little
waters
at
ferry
hinksey
when
i
see
the
rain
a
white
cloud
and
shotover
hill
a
grey
cloud
i
seem
never
before
to
have
seen
the
sweetness
of
rain
october
is
nowhere
so
much
itself
as
among
the
hinksey
elms
when
the
fallen
leaves
smell
of
tea
and
who
that
loves
tea
and
autumn
will
cast
a
stone
the
trees
whether
they
stand
alone
or
in
societies
are
most
perfect
in
autumn
something
in
the
soil
or
climate
preserves
their
farewell
hues
as
in
a
protracted
sunset
looking
at
them
at
nightfall
it
is
hard
to
believe
that
they
have
been
amidst
ten
thousand
sunsets
and
remained
the
same
for
they
ponder
great
matters
and
not
only
in
the
autumn
but
in
may
when
the
silence
is
startled
by
the
gurgling
laughter
of
the
hen
cuckoo
when
spring
comes
into
the
land
i
remember
a
mulberry
that
suspended
its
white
blossom
among
black
boughs
over
a
shining
lawn
at
the
edge
of
the
city
and
the
bells
that
in
march
or
april
seemed
to
be
in
league
with
spring
as
we
heard
them
from
the
fields
and
how
well
a
conversation
would
grow
and
blossom
between
headington
and
wheatley
or
osney
and
eaton
some
that
loved
not
the
country
would
flourish
strangely
in
wisdom
or
folly
as
the
roads
rose
or
fell
or
as
the
grey
oak
stems
of
bagley
wood
began
to
make
a
mist
around
us
the
only
incidents
in
twenty
miles
were
the
occasional
sprints
of
one
who
was
devoted
to
a
liver
or
the
cometary
passing
of
one
on
a
bicycle
that
sang
roi
d
as
if
it
were
a
psalm
containing
the
whole
duty
of
man
and
how
a
book
even
a
schools
book
taken
on
the
river
or
the
hills
would
yield
a
great
sweetness
to
alternate
handlings
and
laughter
of
several
companions
or
if
it
were
a
dull
book
might
be
made
to
yield
more
than
its
author
ever
meant
i
have
ever
thought
that
the
churchyard
with
a
broken
cross
at
hinksey
and
the
willows
below
and
the
elms
above
if
one
takes
george
herbert
there
is
a
better
argument
for
the
church

can

country
without

as
in

nimbly
feed
the
fantasy
which
here
in
consequence
is
apt
to
take
flight
in
wonderful
ways
i
remember
one
and
ovid
was
not
at
all
in
his
mind
who
was
all
but
confident
that
he
saw
persephone
on
flat
pastures
and
red
ploughlands
gleaming
between
green
trees
when
the
hawthorn
was
not
yet
over
and
the
roses
had
begun
and
the
sapphire
was
afloat
on
the
cherwell
as
the
boat
made
a
cool
sound
among
the
river
s
hair
betwixt
water
eaton
and
islip
on
the
quiet
misty
autumn
mornings
the
hum
of
threshing
machines
was
solemn
and
there
at
least
it
was
a
true
harmony
of
autumn
and
the
man
casting
sheaves
from
the
rick
was
exalted
neque
ilium
flava
ceres
alto
nequiquam
spectat
olympo
everywhere
the
fancy
unaided
by
earlier
fancies
sets
to
work
very
busily
in
these
fields
i
have
on
several
afternoons
gone
some
way
towards
the
beginning
of
a
new
mythology
which
might
in
a
thousand
years
puzzle
the
germans
the
shadowy
faces
of
new
deities
float
before
my
eyes
and
i
have
wondered
whether
apollo
and
diana
are
not
immortal
presences
wheresoever
there
are
awful
trees
and
alternating
spaces
of
cool
or
sunlit
lawn
in
the
lanes
there
seems
to
be
another
religion
for
the
night
there
is
a
fitful
wind
and
so
slow
that
as
we
walk
we
can
follow
its
path
while
it
shakes
the
heavy
leaves
and
dewy
grass
and
we
feel
as
if
we
were
trespassing
on
holy
ground
the
land
seems
to
have
changed
masters
or
rather
to
have
one
often
i
saw
a
beech
pale
and
slender
yet
firm
in
its
loftiness
that
shook
delicately
arched
branches
at
the
top
and
below
held
out
an
arm
on
which
a
form
of
schoolboys
might
have
sat
rising
out
of
fine
grass
and
printing
its
perfect
outlines
on
the
sky
and
i
could
fancy
it
enjoyed
a
life
of
pleasure
that
was
health
beauty
that
was
strength
thought
that
was
repose
the
oxford
country
is
rich
in
footpaths
as
any
one
will
know
that
goes
the
round
from
folly
bridge
through
south
hinksey
to
the
fox
at
boar
s
hill
where
the
scent
of
wallflower
and
hawthorn
comes
in
through
the
window
with
the
sound
of
the
rain
and
the
nightingale
and
then
away
skirting
wootton
and
cumnor
past
the
bear
with
its
cool
flagged
room
looking
on
a
field
of
gold
and
cumnor
church
tower
among
elms
and
back
over
the
hurst
where
he
turns
under
the
seven
firs
and
solitary
elm
to
ponder
the
long
alluring
view
towards
stanton
harcourt
and
bablock
hythe
he
may
take
that
walk
many
times
or
wish
to
take
it
and
yet
never
touch
the
same
footpaths
and
never
be
sure
of
the
waste
patch
of
bluebell
and
furze
haunted
by
linnet
and
whinchat
the
newly
harrowed
field
where
the
stones
shine
like
ivory
after
rain
the
green
lane
where
the
beech
leaves
lie
in
february
and
rise
out
of
the
snow
untouched
by
it
in
polished
amber
the
orchard
where
the
grass
is
gloomy
in
april
with
the
shadow
of
bright
cherry
flowers
one
such
footpath
i
remember
that
could
be
seen
falling
among
woods
and
rising
over
hills
faint
and
winding
and
disappearing
at
last
like
a
vision
of
the
perfect
quiet
life
we
started
once
along
it
over
one
of
the
many
fair
little
oxford
bridges
one
that
cleared
the
stream
in
three
graceful
leaps
of
arching
stone
the
hills
were
cloudy
with
woods
in
the
heat
on
either
hand
at
long
distances
apart
lay
little
grey
houses
under
scalloped
capes
of
thatch
and
here
and
there
white
houses
like
children
of
that
sweet
land
circum
ubera
for
the
most
part
we
saw
only
the
great
hawthorn
hedge
which
gave
us
the
sense
of
a
companion
always
abreast
of
us
yet
always
cool
and
fresh
as
if
just
setting
out
it
was
cooler
when
a
bicyclist
passed
by
a
sombre
river
noiselessly
sauntering
seaward
far
away
dropped
with
a
murmur
among
leaves
into
a
pool
that
sound
alone
made
tremble
the
glassy
dome
of
silence
that
extended
miles
on
miles
all
things
were
lightly
powdered
with
gold
by
a
lustre
that
seemed
to
have
been
sifted
through
gauze
the
hazy
sky
striving
to
be
blue
was
reflected
as
purple
in
the
waters
there
too
sunken
and
motionless
lay
amber
willow
leaves
some
floated
down
between
the
sailing
leaves
against
the
false
sky
hung
the
willow
shadows
shadows
of
willows
overhead
with
waving
foliage
like
the
train
of
a
bird
of
paradise
everywhere
the
languid
perfumes
of
corruption
brown
leaves
laid
their
fingers
on
the
cheek
as
they
fell
and
here
and
there
the
hoary
reverse
of
a
willow
leaf
gleamed
in
the
crannied
bases
of
the
trees
a
plough
planted
in
was
curved
like
the
wings
of
a
bird
alighting
we
could
not
walk
as
slowly
as
the
river
flowed
yet
that
seemed
the
true
pace
to
move
in
life
and
so
reach
the
great
grey
sea
hand
in
hand
with
the
river
wound
the
path
until
twilight
began
to
drive
her
dusky
flocks
across
the
west
and
a
light
wind
knitted
the
aspen
branches
against
a
silver
sky
with
a
crescent
moon
as
troubled
tenderly
by
autumnal
maladies
of
soul
we
came
to
our
place
of
rest
a
grey
immemorial
house
with
innumerable
windows
in
praise
of
oxford
chapter
x
in
praise
of
oxford
many
have
written
in
praise
of
oxford
and
so
finely
that
i
have
made
this
selection
with
difficulty
i
have
excluded
the
work
of
living
men
because
i
am
not
familiar
with
it
among
that
which
is
included
will
be
found
passages
from
the
writings
of
one
who
was
at
both
universities
john
lyly
of
two
who
were
at
cambridge
only
dryden
and
wordsworth
of
two
who
were
at
neither
hazlitt
and
hawthorne
and
of
several
brilliant
lovers
of
oxford
whose
faith
was
filial
and
undivided
almost
all
the
quotations
have
wit
or
beauty
enough
to
defend
them
even
had
they
been
less
apposite
their
charm
is
redoubled
in
this
place
since
they
are
in
oxford
s
praise
they
are
worthy
of
a
city
which
a
learned
german
compares
with
the
creations
of
poussin
and
claude
but
they
are
in
no
need
of
compliment
i
could
only
wish
that
i
had
put
down
nothing
unworthy
of
their
blessing
i
have
and
so
they
stand
in
place
of
epilogue
where
they
perform
the
not
unprecedented
duty
of
apology
there
are
also
in
this
islande
two
famous
universities
the
one
the
other
both
for
the
profession
of
all
sciences
for
divinitie
phisicke
lawe
and
for
all
kinde
of
learning
excelling
all
the
universities
of
christendome
i
was
myself
in
either
of
them
and
like
them
both
so
well
that
i
meane
not
in
the
way
of
controversie
to
preferre
any
for
the
better
in
englande
but
both
for
the
best
in
the
world
saving
this
that
colledges
in
are
much
stately
for
the
building
and
much
more
sumptuous
for
the
houses
in
the
towne
but
the
learning
neither
lyeth
in
the
free
stones
of
the
one
nor
the
fine
streates
of
the
other
for
out
of
them
both
do
dayly
proceede
men
of
great
wisdome
to
rule
in
the
common
welth
of
learning
to
instruct
the
common
people
of
all
singuler
kinde
of
professions
to
do
good
to
all
and
let
this
suffice
not
to
enquire
which
of
them
is
the
superior
but
that
neither
of
them
have
their
equall
neither
to
ask
which
of
them
is
the
most
auncient
but
whether
any
other
bee
so
john
lyly

the
cherwell
flows
along

the
stateliness
of
public
structures
or
the
healthy
and
pleasant
situation
for
the
plain

whispering
from
