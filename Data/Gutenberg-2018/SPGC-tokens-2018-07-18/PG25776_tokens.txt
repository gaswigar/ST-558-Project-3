the
evils
of
long
and
dangerous
years
finally
erupted
in
blood
the
telescreen
lit
up
promptly
at
eight
smiling
brad
came
on
with
his
usual
greeting
good
morning
it
a
beautiful
day
in
chicagee
harry
collins
rolled
over
and
twitched
off
the
receiver
this
i
doubt
he
muttered
he
sat
up
and
reached
into
the
closet
for
his
clothing
visitors
particularly
feminine
ones
were
always
exclaiming
over
the
advantages
of
harry
apartment
so
convenient
they
would
say
everything
handy
right
within
reach
and
think
of
all
the
extra
steps
you
save
of
course
most
of
them
were
just
being
polite
and
trying
to
cheer
harry
up
they
knew
damned
well
that
he
was
living
in
one
room
through
any
choice
of
his
own
the
housing
act
was
something
you
just
could
get
around
not
in
chicagee
these
days
a
bachelor
was
entitled
to
one
room
no
more
and
no
less
and
even
though
harry
was
making
a
speedy
buck
at
the
agency
he
could
hope
to
beat
the
regulations
there
was
only
one
way
to
beat
them
and
that
was
to
get
married
marriage
would
automatically
entitle
him
to
two
rooms
he
could
find
them
someplace
more
than
a
few
of
his
feminine
visitors
had
hinted
at
just
that
but
harry
did
respond
marriage
was
no
solution
the
way
he
figured
it
he
knew
that
he
could
hope
to
locate
a
apartment
any
closer
than
eighty
miles
away
it
was
bad
enough
driving
forty
miles
to
and
from
work
every
morning
and
night
without
doubling
the
distance
if
he
did
find
a
bigger
place
that
would
mean
a
trip
each
way
on
one
of
the
commutrains
and
the
commutrains
were
murder
the
black
hole
of
calcutta
on
wheels
but
then
everything
was
murder
harry
reflected
as
he
stepped
from
the
toilet
to
the
sink
from
the
sink
to
the
stove
from
the
stove
to
the
table
powdered
eggs
for
breakfast
that
was
murder
too
but
it
was
a
fast
cheap
meal
easy
to
prepare
and
the
ingredients
did
waste
a
lot
of
storage
space
the
only
trouble
was
he
hated
the
way
they
tasted
harry
wished
he
had
time
to
eat
his
breakfasts
in
a
restaurant
he
could
afford
the
price
but
he
could
afford
to
wait
in
line
more
than
a
or
so
his
office
schedule
at
the
agency
started
promptly
at
and
he
did
get
out
until
it
was
a
long
hard
day
sometimes
he
wished
he
worked
in
the
new
philly
area
where
a
day
was
the
rule
but
he
supposed
that
would
mean
any
real
saving
in
time
because
he
have
to
live
further
out
what
was
the
population
in
new
philly
now
something
like
was
it
chicagee
was
much
smaller
only
this
year
year
harry
shook
his
head
and
took
a
gulp
of
the
instantea
yes
this
year
the
population
was
and
the
boundaries
of
the
community
extended
north
to
what
used
to
be
the
old
milwaukee
and
south
past
gary
what
would
it
be
like
year
and
the
year
following
lately
that
question
had
begun
to
haunt
harry
he
could
quite
figure
out
why
after
all
it
was
none
of
his
business
really
he
had
a
good
job
security
a
nice
place
just
two
hours
from
the
loop
he
even
drove
his
own
car
what
more
could
he
ask
and
why
did
he
have
to
start
the
day
like
this
with
a
blinding
headache
harry
finished
his
instantea
and
considered
the
matter
yes
it
was
beginning
again
just
as
it
had
on
almost
every
morning
for
the
past
month
he
sit
down
at
the
table
eat
his
usual
breakfast
and
end
up
with
a
headache
why
it
was
the
food
for
a
while
he
deliberately
varied
his
diet
but
that
did
make
any
difference
and
he
had
his
usual
monthly
checkup
not
more
than
ten
days
ago
only
to
be
assured
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
him
still
the
headaches
persisted
every
morning
when
he
sit
down
and
jerk
his
head
to
the
left
like
this
that
was
it
jerking
his
head
to
the
left
it
always
seemed
to
trigger
the
pain
but
why
and
where
had
he
picked
up
this
habit
of
jerking
his
head
to
the
left
harry
did
know
he
glanced
at
his
watch
it
was
almost
nine
now
high
time
that
he
got
started
he
reached
over
to
the
interapartment
video
and
dialled
the
garage
downstairs
bill
he
said
can
you
bring
my
car
around
to
number
three
the
tiny
face
in
the
grinned
sheepishly
collins
ai
it
gee
i
sorry
collins
night
crew
took
on
a
new
man
he
must
have
futzed
around
with
the
lists
and
i
ca
find
your
number
harry
sighed
it
he
said
light
blue
pax
do
you
want
the
license
number
too
no
just
your
parking
number
i
recognize
it
when
i
see
it
but
god
only
knows
what
level
it
on
that
night
man
really
never
mind
harry
interrupted
how
soon
twenty
minutes
or
so
maybe
half
an
hour
half
an
hour
i
be
late
hurry
it
up
harry
clicked
the
video
and
shook
his
head
half
an
hour
well
you
had
to
expect
these
things
if
you
wanted
to
be
independent
and
do
your
own
driving
today
if
he
wanted
to
work
his
priority
through
the
office
he
could
get
his
application
honored
on
the
line
within
a
month
but
the
was
just
another
commutrain
and
he
could
take
it
standing
and
swaying
for
almost
two
hours
fighting
the
crowds
battling
his
way
in
and
out
of
the
sidewalk
escalators
besides
there
was
always
the
danger
of
being
crushed
he
seen
an
old
man
trampled
to
death
on
a
michigan
boulevard
and
he
never
forgotten
it
being
afraid
was
only
a
partial
reason
for
his
reluctance
to
change
the
worst
thing
for
harry
was
the
thought
of
all
those
people
the
forced
bodily
contact
the
awareness
of
smothered
breathing
odors
and
the
crushing
confinement
of
flesh
against
flesh
it
was
bad
enough
in
the
lines
or
on
the
streets
the
commutrain
was
just
too
much
yet
as
a
small
boy
harry
could
remember
the
day
when
he
loved
such
trips
sitting
there
looking
out
of
the
window
as
the
scenery
whirled
past
that
was
always
a
thrill
when
you
were
a
little
kid
how
long
ago
had
that
been
more
than
twenty
years
was
it
now
there
were
any
seats
and
no
windows
which
was
just
as
well
probably
because
the
scenery
did
whirl
past
any
more
either
instead
there
was
a
stop
at
every
station
on
the
line
and
a
constant
battle
as
people
jockeyed
for
position
to
reach
the
in
time
no
the
car
was
better
harry
reached
for
a
container
in
the
cabinet
and
poured
out
a
couple
of
aspirystamines
that
ought
to
help
the
headache
at
least
until
he
got
to
the
office
then
he
could
start
with
the
daily
quota
of
yellowjackets
meanwhile
getting
out
on
the
street
might
help
him
too
a
shame
there
was
a
window
in
this
apartment
but
then
what
good
would
it
do
really
all
he
could
see
through
it
would
be
the
next
apartment
he
shrugged
and
picked
up
his
coat
time
to
go
downstairs
maybe
the
car
would
be
located
sooner
than
bill
had
promised
after
all
he
had
nine
assistants
and
not
everybody
went
to
work
on
this
first
daylight
shift
harry
walked
down
the
hall
and
punched
the
elevator
button
he
looked
at
the
indicator
watched
the
red
band
move
towards
the
numeral
of
this
floor
then
sweep
past
it
full
up
he
muttered
oh
well
he
reached
out
and
touched
both
sides
of
the
corridor
that
was
another
thing
he
disliked
these
narrow
corridors
two
people
could
scarcely
squeeze
past
one
another
without
touching
of
course
it
did
save
space
to
build
apartments
this
way
and
space
was
at
a
premium
but
harry
could
get
used
to
it
now
he
remembered
some
of
the
old
buildings
that
were
still
around
when
he
was
a
little
boy
the
headache
seemed
to
be
getting
worse
instead
of
better
harry
looked
at
the
indicator
above
the
other
elevator
entrance
the
red
band
was
crawling
upward
passing
him
to
stop
on
that
was
the
top
floor
now
it
was
moving
down
down
stopping
on
and
here
it
was
stand
back
please
said
the
tape
harry
did
his
best
to
oblige
but
there
was
much
room
a
good
two
dozen
of
his
upstairs
neighbors
jammed
the
compartment
harry
thought
he
recognized
one
or
two
of
the
men
but
he
could
be
sure
there
were
so
many
people
so
many
faces
after
a
while
it
got
so
they
all
seemed
to
look
alike
yes
and
breathed
alike
and
felt
alike
when
you
were
squeezed
up
against
them
and
you
were
always
being
squeezed
up
against
them
wherever
you
went
and
you
could
smell
them
and
hear
them
wheeze
and
cough
and
you
went
falling
down
with
them
into
a
bottomless
pit
where
your
head
began
to
throb
and
throb
and
it
was
hard
to
move
away
from
all
that
heat
and
pressure
it
was
hard
enough
just
to
keep
from
screaming
then
the
door
opened
and
harry
was
catapulted
out
into
the
lobby
the
mob
behind
him
pushed
and
clawed
because
they
were
in
a
hurry
they
were
always
in
a
hurry
these
days
and
if
you
got
in
their
way
trample
you
down
like
that
old
man
had
been
trampled
down
there
was
no
room
for
one
man
in
a
crowd
any
more
harry
blinked
and
shook
his
head
he
gripped
the
edge
of
the
wall
and
clung
there
in
an
effort
to
avoid
being
swept
out
of
the
lobby
completely
his
hands
were
sticky
with
perspiration
they
slipped
off
as
he
slowly
inched
his
way
back
through
the
crush
of
the
mob
wait
for
me
he
called
wait
for
me
i
going
down
but
his
voice
was
lost
in
the
maelstrom
of
sound
just
as
his
body
was
lost
in
the
maelstrom
of
motion
besides
an
automatic
elevator
can
not
hear
it
is
merely
a
mechanism
that
goes
up
and
down
just
like
the
other
mechanisms
that
go
in
and
out
or
around
and
around
and
you
get
caught
up
in
them
the
way
a
squirrel
gets
caught
in
a
and
you
race
and
race
and
the
best
you
can
hope
for
is
to
keep
up
with
the
machinery
the
elevator
door
clanged
shut
before
harry
could
reach
it
he
waited
for
another
car
to
arrive
and
this
time
he
stood
aside
as
the
crowd
emerged
then
darted
in
behind
them
the
car
descended
to
the
first
garage
level
and
harry
stood
gulping
gratefully
in
the
comparative
isolation
there
were
more
than
ten
people
accompanying
him
he
emerged
on
the
ramp
gave
his
number
to
the
attendant
and
waved
at
bill
in
his
office
bill
seemed
to
recognize
him
at
least
he
nodded
briefly
no
sense
trying
to
talk
not
in
this
sullen
subterranea
filled
with
the
booming
echo
of
exhausts
the
despairing
shriek
of
brakes
headlights
flickered
in
the
darkness
as
cars
whirled
past
ascending
and
descending
on
the
loading
platforms
the
signal
systems
winked
from
the
walls
and
tires
screeched
defiance
to
the
warning
bells
theologians
harry
remembered
used
to
argue
whether
there
really
was
a
hell
and
if
so
had
it
been
created
by
god
or
the
devil
too
bad
they
were
around
today
to
get
an
answer
to
their
questions
there
a
hell
and
it
had
been
created
by
general
motors
harry
temples
began
to
throb
through
blurred
eyes
he
saw
the
attendant
beckoning
him
down
the
line
to
a
platform
marked
he
stood
there
with
a
cluster
of
others
waiting
what
was
the
matter
with
him
today
anyway
first
the
headache
and
now
his
feet
were
hurting
standing
around
waiting
that
what
did
it
this
eternal
waiting
when
he
was
a
kid
the
grownups
were
always
complaining
about
the
long
work
days
and
how
they
cut
into
their
leisure
time
well
maybe
they
had
reason
to
gripe
but
at
least
there
some
leisure
before
work
began
or
after
it
was
through
now
that
extra
time
was
consumed
in
waiting
standing
in
line
standing
in
crowds
wearing
yourself
out
doing
nothing
still
this
time
it
was
really
so
bad
within
ten
minutes
the
light
blue
pax
rolled
up
before
him
harry
climbed
in
as
the
attendant
slid
out
from
behind
the
wheel
and
prepared
to
leave
then
a
fat
man
appeared
running
along
the
ramp
he
gestured
wildly
with
a
plump
thumb
harry
nodded
briefly
and
the
fat
man
hurled
himself
into
the
seat
beside
him
and
slammed
the
door
they
were
off
harry
read
the
signals
impatiently
waiting
for
the
green
the
moment
he
saw
it
he
gunned
his
motor
and
got
the
car
up
to
and
zipped
away
that
what
he
liked
that
what
he
always
waited
for
of
course
it
was
dangerous
here
in
the
tunnel
system
under
the
garage
but
harry
always
got
a
thrill
out
of
speed
the
pax
could
do
or
even
forty
probably
on
a
theoretical
open
road
still
was
enough
to
satisfy
harry
he
whizzed
up
the
ramp
turned
headed
for
the
then
braked
and
waited
for
the
signal
to
emerge
harsh
sunlight
pierced
the
smog
and
he
felt
his
eyes
watering
now
the
street
noises
assailed
his
ears
the
grinding
of
gears
the
revving
of
motors
but
at
least
the
total
volume
was
lower
and
with
the
windows
tightly
closed
against
the
acrid
air
he
could
hear
turning
to
the
fat
man
beside
him
he
said
hello
frazer
what
the
urgency
got
to
get
downtown
before
eleven
the
fat
man
answered
board
meeting
today
but
i
forgot
about
it
knew
i
would
have
time
to
wait
for
the
car
and
i
was
hoping
i
find
someone
who
give
me
a
lift
lucky
for
me
that
you
came
along
when
you
did
harry
nodded
but
did
not
reply
at
the
moment
he
was
trying
to
edge
into
the
traffic
beyond
it
flowed
bumper
to
bumper
in
a
steady
stream
a
stream
moving
at
the
uniform
and
prescribed
rate
of
fifteen
miles
per
hour
he
released
his
brakes
and
the
pax
nosed
forward
until
a
truck
sounded
its
horn
in
ominous
warning
the
noise
hurt
head
he
winced
and
grimaced
what
the
matter
asked
frazer
headache
harry
muttered
he
menaced
a
chevsoto
with
his
bumper
damn
it
i
thought
they
did
allow
those
big
jobs
on
this
arterial
during
rush
hours
gradually
he
managed
to
turn
until
he
was
in
the
righthand
lane
there
he
said
we
off
and
so
they
were
for
all
of
three
minutes
with
the
speed
set
at
fifteen
on
autopilot
then
a
signal
went
into
action
somewhere
up
ahead
and
the
procession
halted
harry
flicked
his
switch
as
was
customary
horns
sounded
indignantly
on
all
sides
a
mechanical
protest
against
a
mechanical
obstruction
harry
winced
again
hangover
frazer
asked
solicitously
try
aspirystamine
harry
shook
his
head
no
hangover
and
i
already
taken
three
thanks
nothing
does
any
good
so
i
guess
it
just
up
to
you
up
to
me
frazer
was
genuinely
puzzled
what
can
i
do
about
your
headaches
you
on
the
board
of
city
planners
are
you
that
right
well
i
got
a
suggestion
for
you
to
give
to
them
tell
them
to
start
planning
to
drop
a
couple
of
heavy
on
this
area
clean
out
twenty
or
thirty
million
people
we
never
miss
frazer
chuckled
wryly
i
wish
i
had
a
buck
for
every
time
i
heard
suggestion
ever
stop
to
think
why
you
hear
it
so
often
it
because
everybody
feels
the
same
way
we
ca
take
being
hemmed
in
like
this
well
a
bomb
would
help
you
know
that
frazer
pursed
his
lips
robertson
figured
out
what
would
happen
with
the
harry
glanced
sideways
at
his
companion
as
the
car
started
forward
once
again
i
always
wondered
about
that
he
said
seriously
i
mean
is
the
story
really
true
or
is
it
just
some
more
of
this
government
propaganda
you
fellows
like
to
hand
out
frazer
sighed
it
true
all
right
there
was
a
scientist
named
robertson
and
he
did
come
up
with
the
formula
way
back
in
proved
it
too
use
what
he
developed
and
the
would
never
end
scientists
in
other
countries
tested
the
theory
and
agreed
there
was
no
collusion
it
just
worked
out
that
way
on
a
practical
basis
has
been
a
war
since
what
more
proof
do
you
want
well
could
they
just
use
some
of
the
hydrogen
bombs
be
sensible
man
once
a
war
started
no
nation
could
resist
the
temptation
to
go
fortunately
everyone
realizes
that
so
we
have
peace
permanent
peace
i
take
a
good
war
anytime
in
preference
to
this
harry
you
do
know
what
you
talking
about
you
are
so
young
that
you
ca
remember
what
it
was
like
in
the
old
days
everybody
living
in
fear
waiting
for
the
bombs
to
fall
people
dying
of
disease
and
worried
about
dying
from
radiation
and
fallout
all
the
international
rivalries
the
the
eternal
pressures
and
constant
crises
nobody
in
his
right
mind
would
want
to
go
back
to
we
come
a
mighty
long
way
in
the
last
twenty
years
or
so
harry
switched
to
autopilot
and
sat
back
maybe
that
the
trouble
he
said
maybe
we
come
too
far
too
fast
i
was
kidding
about
dropping
those
either
has
to
be
done
we
ca
go
on
like
this
indefinitely
why
does
the
board
come
up
with
an
answer
frazer
shrugged
his
heavy
shoulders
you
think
we
have
tried
are
trying
now
we
aware
of
the
situation
as
well
as
you
are
and
then
some
but
there
no
easy
solution
the
population
just
keeps
growing
that
all
no
war
to
cut
it
down
contagious
diseases
at
a
minimum
average
up
to
ninety
years
or
better
naturally
this
results
in
a
problem
but
a
bomb
wo
help
bring
about
any
permanent
solution
besides
this
is
a
local
matter
or
even
a
national
one
it
global
what
do
you
think
those
summit
meetings
are
all
about
what
about
birth
control
harry
asked
why
do
they
really
get
behind
an
emigration
movement
we
ca
limit
procreation
by
law
you
know
that
frazer
peered
out
at
the
swarming
streams
on
the
sidewalk
levels
it
more
than
a
religious
or
a
political
question
it
a
social
one
people
want
kids
they
can
afford
them
besides
the
housing
act
is
set
up
so
that
having
kids
is
just
about
the
only
way
you
can
ever
get
into
larger
could
they
try
i
mean
grant
priority
to
people
who
are
willing
to
be
sterilized
they
tried
it
on
a
limited
experimental
scale
about
three
years
ago
out
on
the
west
coast
i
never
heard
anything
about
it
damned
right
you
did
frazer
replied
grimly
they
kept
the
whole
project
under
wraps
and
for
a
good
reason
the
publicity
might
have
wrecked
the
administration
what
happened
what
do
you
suppose
happened
there
were
riots
do
you
think
a
man
and
his
wife
and
three
kids
living
in
three
rooms
liked
the
idea
of
standing
by
and
watching
a
sterilized
couple
enjoy
a
place
with
lawn
space
things
got
pretty
ugly
let
me
tell
you
there
was
a
rumor
going
around
that
the
country
was
in
the
hands
of
homosexuals
the
churches
were
up
in
arms
and
if
that
was
bad
enough
we
had
to
face
up
to
the
primary
problem
there
just
was
just
is
enough
not
in
areas
suitable
for
maintaining
a
population
mountains
are
still
mountains
and
deserts
are
still
deserts
maybe
we
can
put
up
housing
in
such
regions
but
who
can
live
there
even
with
decentralization
going
full
blast
people
must
live
within
reasonable
access
to
their
work
no
we
just
running
out
of
room
again
the
car
halted
on
signal
over
the
blasting
of
the
horns
harry
repeated
his
query
about
emigration
frazer
shook
his
head
but
made
no
attempt
to
reply
until
the
horns
had
quieted
and
they
were
under
way
once
more
as
for
emigration
we
just
getting
some
of
our
own
medicine
in
return
about
eighty
years
ago
we
clamped
down
and
closed
the
door
on
immigrants
established
a
quota
now
the
same
quota
is
being
used
against
us
and
you
ca
really
blame
other
nations
for
it
facing
worse
population
increases
than
we
are
look
at
the
african
federation
and
what
happened
there
in
spite
of
all
the
wealth
and
south
america
is
even
worse
in
spite
of
all
the
reclamation
projects
fifteen
years
ago
when
they
cleared
out
the
amazon
basin
they
thought
they
have
enough
room
for
fifty
years
to
come
and
now
look
at
it
two
hundred
million
that
the
latest
figure
we
got
so
what
the
answer
harry
asked
i
do
know
if
it
was
for
hydroponics
and
the
ag
culture
controls
we
be
licked
right
now
as
it
is
we
can
still
supply
enough
food
and
the
old
takes
care
of
the
economy
as
a
whole
i
have
no
recommendations
for
an
overall
solution
or
even
a
regional
one
my
job
the
board
job
is
regulating
housing
and
traffic
and
transportation
in
chicagee
that
about
all
you
can
expect
us
to
handle
again
they
jolted
to
a
stop
and
the
horns
howled
all
around
them
harry
sat
there
until
a
muscle
in
the
side
of
his
jaw
began
to
twitch
suddenly
he
pounded
on
the
horn
with
both
fists
shut
up
he
yelled
for
the
love
of
heaven
shut
up
abruptly
he
slumped
back
sorry
he
mumbled
it
my
damned
headache
i
i
got
to
get
out
of
this
job
getting
you
down
no
it
a
good
job
at
least
everybody
tells
me
so
hours
a
week
three
hundred
bucks
the
car
the
room
the
telescreen
and
liquor
and
yellowjackets
plenty
of
time
to
kill
unless
it
the
time
that
killing
me
but
what
do
you
harry
stepped
on
the
accelerator
and
they
inched
along
now
the
street
widened
into
eight
traffic
lanes
and
the
big
semis
joined
the
procession
on
the
edge
of
the
downtown
area
i
want
out
harry
said
out
of
this
do
you
ever
visit
the
national
preserves
frazer
asked
sure
i
do
fly
up
every
vacation
take
a
tame
plane
to
a
tame
government
resort
and
catch
my
quota
of
two
tame
fish
great
sport
if
i
got
married
i
be
entitled
to
four
tame
fish
but
that
not
what
i
want
i
want
what
my
father
used
to
talk
about
i
want
to
drive
into
the
country
without
a
permit
mind
you
just
to
drive
wherever
i
like
i
want
to
see
cows
and
chickens
and
trees
and
lakes
and
sky
you
sound
like
a
naturalist
do
sneer
maybe
the
naturalists
are
right
maybe
we
ought
to
cut
out
all
this
phoney
progress
and
phoney
peace
that
passeth
all
understanding
i
no
liberal
do
get
me
wrong
but
sometimes
i
think
the
naturalists
have
the
only
answer
but
what
can
you
do
about
it
frazer
murmured
suppose
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
they
right
how
can
you
change
things
we
ca
just
ourselves
to
stop
growing
and
we
ca
legislate
against
biology
more
people
in
better
health
with
more
free
time
are
just
bound
to
have
more
offspring
it
inevitable
under
the
circumstances
and
neither
you
nor
i
nor
anyone
has
the
right
to
condemn
millions
upon
millions
of
others
to
death
through
war
or
disease
i
know
harry
said
it
hopeless
i
guess
all
the
same
i
want
out
he
wet
his
lips
frazer
you
on
the
board
here
you
got
connections
higher
up
if
i
could
only
get
a
chance
to
transfer
to
ag
culture
go
on
one
of
those
farms
as
a
worker
frazer
shook
his
head
sorry
harry
you
know
the
situation
there
i
sure
right
now
there
roughly
ninety
million
approved
applications
on
file
everybody
wants
to
get
into
ag
culture
but
could
i
just
buy
some
land
get
a
government
contract
for
foodstuffs
have
you
got
the
bucks
a
minimum
forty
acres
leased
from
one
of
the
farm
corporations
will
cost
you
two
hundred
thousand
at
the
very
least
not
counting
equipment
he
paused
besides
vocational
apt
what
did
your
tests
show
you
right
harry
said
i
supposed
to
be
an
agency
man
an
agency
man
until
i
die
or
retire
on
my
pension
at
fifty
and
sit
in
my
little
room
for
the
next
fifty
years
turning
on
the
telescreen
every
morning
to
hear
some
loudmouthed
liar
tell
me
it
a
beautiful
day
in
chicagee
who
knows
maybe
by
that
time
we
have
a
hundred
billion
people
enjoying
peace
and
progress
and
prosperity
all
sitting
in
little
rooms
and
watch
out
frazer
grabbed
the
wheel
you
nearly
hit
that
truck
he
waited
until
harry
face
relaxed
before
relinquishing
his
grip
harry
you
better
go
in
for
a
checkup
it
is
just
a
headache
with
you
is
it
you
not
fooling
harry
told
him
it
is
just
a
headache
he
began
to
think
about
what
it
was
and
that
helped
a
little
it
helped
him
get
through
the
worst
part
which
was
the
downtown
traffic
and
letting
frazer
off
and
listening
to
frazer
urge
him
to
see
a
doctor
then
he
got
to
the
building
parking
area
and
let
them
take
his
car
away
and
bury
it
down
in
the
droning
darkness
where
the
horns
hooted
and
the
headlights
glared
harry
climbed
the
ramp
and
mingled
with
the
shift
on
its
way
up
to
the
elevators
eighteen
elevators
in
his
building
to
serve
eighty
floors
nine
of
the
elevators
were
express
to
the
fiftieth
floor
three
were
express
to
he
wanted
one
of
the
latter
and
so
did
the
mob
the
crushing
clinging
mob
they
pressed
and
panted
the
way
mobs
always
do
mobs
that
lynch
and
torture
and
dance
around
bonfires
and
guillotines
and
try
to
drag
you
down
to
trample
you
to
death
because
they
ca
stand
you
if
your
name
is
harry
and
you
want
to
be
different
they
hate
you
because
you
do
like
powdered
eggs
and
the
telescreen
and
a
beautiful
day
in
chicagee
and
they
stare
at
you
because
your
forehead
hurts
and
the
muscle
in
your
jaw
twitches
and
they
know
you
want
to
scream
as
you
go
up
up
up
and
try
to
think
why
you
get
a
headache
from
jerking
your
head
to
the
left
then
harry
was
at
the
office
door
and
they
said
good
morning
when
he
came
in
all
eighty
of
the
typists
in
the
outer
office
working
their
electronic
machines
and
offering
him
their
electronic
smiles
including
the
girl
he
had
made
electronic
love
to
last
saturday
night
and
who
wanted
him
to
move
into
a
marriage
and
have
children
lots
of
children
who
could
enjoy
peace
and
progress
and
prosperity
harry
snapped
out
of
it
going
down
the
corridor
only
a
few
steps
more
and
he
be
safe
in
his
office
his
own
private
office
almost
as
big
as
his
apartment
and
there
would
be
liquor
and
the
yellowjackets
in
the
drawer
that
would
help
then
he
could
get
to
work
what
was
today
assignment
he
tried
to
remember
it
was
was
it
telescreenads
for
makers
of
he
opened
his
office
door
and
then
slammed
it
shut
behind
him
for
a
minute
everything
blurred
and
then
he
could
remember
now
he
knew
what
caused
him
to
jerk
his
head
what
gave
him
the
headaches
when
he
did
so
of
course
that
was
it
when
he
sat
down
at
the
table
for
breakfast
in
the
morning
he
turned
his
head
to
the
left
because
he
always
done
so
ever
since
he
was
a
little
boy
a
little
boy
in
what
was
then
wheaton
sitting
at
the
breakfast
table
and
looking
out
of
the
window
looking
out
at
summer
sunshine
spring
rain
autumn
haze
the
white
wonder
of
newfallen
snow
he
never
broken
himself
of
the
habit
he
still
looked
to
the
left
every
morning
just
as
he
had
today
but
there
was
no
window
any
more
there
was
only
a
blank
wall
and
beyond
it
the
smog
and
the
clamor
and
the
crowds
had
problems
nobody
was
buying
any
more
nobody
except
the
people
who
put
up
buildings
like
this
there
were
still
windows
on
the
top
floors
just
like
the
window
here
in
his
office
harry
stepped
over
to
it
moving
very
slowly
because
of
his
head
it
hurt
to
keep
his
eyes
open
but
he
wanted
to
stare
out
of
the
window
up
this
high
you
could
see
above
the
smog
you
could
see
the
sun
like
a
radiant
jewel
packed
in
the
cotton
cumulus
of
clouds
if
you
opened
the
window
you
could
feel
fresh
air
against
your
forehead
you
could
breathe
it
in
and
breathe
out
the
headache
but
you
did
dare
look
down
oh
no
never
look
because
then
you
see
the
buildings
all
around
you
the
buildings
below
black
and
sooty
their
jagged
outlines
like
the
stumps
of
rotten
teeth
and
they
stretched
off
in
all
directions
as
far
as
the
eye
could
attain
row
after
row
of
rotten
teeth
grinning
up
from
the
throat
of
the
streets
from
the
maw
of
the
city
far
below
came
this
faint
but
endless
howling
this
screaming
of
traffic
and
toil
and
you
help
it
you
breathed
in
too
along
with
the
fresh
air
and
it
poisoned
you
and
it
did
more
than
make
your
head
ache
it
made
your
heart
ache
and
it
made
your
soul
sick
and
it
made
you
close
your
eyes
and
your
lungs
and
your
brain
against
it
harry
reeled
but
he
knew
this
was
the
only
way
your
brain
against
and
then
when
you
opened
your
eyes
again
maybe
you
could
see
the
way
things
used
to
be
it
was
snowing
out
and
it
was
a
snow
the
very
best
kind
for
snowballs
and
making
a
snowman
and
the
whole
gang
would
come
out
after
school
but
there
was
no
school
this
was
saturday
and
the
leaves
were
russet
and
gold
and
red
so
that
it
looked
as
if
all
the
trees
in
the
world
were
on
fire
and
you
could
scuff
when
you
walked
and
pile
up
fallen
leaves
from
the
grass
and
roll
in
them
and
it
was
swell
to
roll
down
the
front
lawn
in
summer
just
roll
right
down
to
the
edge
of
the
sidewalk
like
it
was
a
big
hill
and
let
daddy
catch
you
at
the
bottom
laughing
mamma
laughed
too
and
she
said
it
springtime
the
lilacs
are
out
do
you
want
to
touch
the
pretty
lilacs
harry
and
harry
did
quite
understand
what
she
was
saying
but
he
reached
out
and
they
were
purple
and
smelled
of
rain
and
soft
sweetness
and
they
were
just
beyond
the
window
if
he
reached
a
little
further
he
could
touch
them
and
then
the
snow
and
the
leaves
and
the
grass
and
the
lilacs
disappeared
and
harry
could
see
the
rotten
teeth
again
leering
and
looming
and
snapping
at
him
they
were
going
to
bite
they
were
going
to
chew
they
were
going
to
devour
and
he
could
stop
them
could
stop
himself
he
was
falling
into
the
howling
jaws
of
the
city
his
last
conscious
effort
was
a
desperate
attempt
to
gulp
fresh
air
into
his
lungs
before
he
pinwheeled
down
fresh
air
was
good
for
headaches
harry
collins
it
took
them
ten
seconds
to
save
harry
from
falling
but
it
took
him
over
ten
weeks
to
regain
his
balance
in
fact
well
over
two
months
had
passed
before
he
could
fully
realize
just
what
had
happened
or
where
he
was
now
they
must
have
noticed
something
was
wrong
with
him
that
morning
at
the
office
because
two
supervisors
and
an
exec
rushed
in
and
caught
him
just
as
he
was
going
out
of
the
window
and
then
they
had
sent
him
away
sent
him
this
is
fine
he
told
manschoff
if
i
known
how
well
they
treated
you
i
have
gone
years
ago
manschoff
plump
face
was
impassive
but
the
little
deepened
around
the
edges
of
his
eyes
maybe
that
why
we
take
such
care
not
to
publicize
our
recent
advances
in
mental
therapy
he
said
everybody
would
want
to
get
into
a
treatment
center
and
then
where
would
we
be
harry
nodded
staring
past
the
doctor
shoulder
staring
out
of
the
wide
window
at
the
broad
expanse
of
rolling
countryside
beyond
i
still
do
understand
though
he
murmured
how
can
you
possibly
manage
to
maintain
an
institution
like
this
with
all
the
space
and
the
luxuries
the
inmates
seem
to
lead
a
better
life
than
the
adjusted
individuals
outside
it
perhaps
manschoff
fingers
formed
a
pudgy
steeple
but
then
so
many
things
seem
to
be
nowadays
do
they
was
it
the
realization
of
this
fact
which
precipitated
your
own
recent
difficulties
almost
precipitated
me
bodily
out
of
that
window
harry
admitted
cheerfully
and
that
another
thing
i
was
sent
here
i
suppose
because
i
attempted
suicide
gone
into
shock
temporary
amnesia
something
like
that
something
like
that
the
doctor
echoed
contemplating
his
steeple
but
you
did
give
me
any
treatment
harry
continued
oh
i
was
kept
under
sedation
for
a
while
i
realize
that
and
you
and
some
of
the
other
talked
to
me
but
mainly
i
just
rested
in
a
nice
big
room
and
ate
nice
big
meals
so
the
steeple
fleshy
spire
collapsed
so
what
i
want
to
know
is
when
does
the
real
treatment
start
when
do
i
go
into
analysis
or
chemotherapy
and
all
that
manschoff
shrugged
do
you
think
you
need
those
things
now
harry
gazed
out
at
the
sunlight
beyond
the
window
and
no
come
to
think
of
it
i
do
believe
i
do
i
feel
better
now
than
i
have
in
years
his
companion
leaned
back
meaning
that
for
years
you
felt
all
wrong
because
you
were
constricted
physically
psychically
and
emotionally
you
were
cramped
squeezed
in
a
vise
until
the
pressure
became
intolerable
but
now
that
pressure
has
been
removed
as
a
result
you
no
longer
suffer
and
there
is
no
need
to
seek
escape
in
death
or
denial
of
identity
this
radical
change
of
attitude
has
been
brought
about
here
in
just
a
little
more
than
two
months
time
and
yet
you
asking
me
when
the
treatment
begins
i
guess
i
already
had
the
real
treatment
then
have
i
that
is
correct
prolonged
analysis
or
drastic
therapy
is
unnecessary
we
merely
given
you
what
you
seemed
to
need
i
very
grateful
harry
said
but
how
can
you
afford
to
do
it
manschoff
built
another
temple
to
an
unknown
god
he
inspected
the
architecture
critically
now
as
he
spoke
because
your
problem
is
a
rarity
he
said
rarity
i
have
thought
millions
of
people
would
be
breaking
down
every
month
the
naturalists
say
the
doctor
nodded
wearily
i
know
what
they
say
but
let
dismiss
rumors
and
consider
facts
have
you
ever
read
any
report
stating
that
the
number
of
cases
of
mental
illness
ran
into
the
millions
no
i
have
for
that
matter
do
you
happen
to
know
of
who
was
ever
sent
to
a
treatment
center
such
as
this
well
of
course
everybody
goes
in
to
see
the
medics
for
regular
and
this
includes
an
interview
with
a
psych
but
if
in
bad
shape
he
just
puts
them
on
extra
tranquilizers
i
guess
sometimes
he
reviews
their
vocational
apt
tests
and
shifts
them
over
into
different
jobs
in
other
areas
manschoff
bowed
his
head
in
reverence
above
the
steeple
as
if
satisfied
with
the
labors
he
had
wrought
that
is
roughly
correct
and
i
believe
if
you
search
your
memory
you
wo
recall
even
a
mention
of
a
treatment
center
this
sort
of
place
is
virtually
extinct
nowadays
there
are
still
some
institutions
for
those
suffering
from
functional
mental
disorders
paresis
senile
dementia
congenital
abnormalities
but
regular
and
preventative
therapy
take
care
of
the
great
majority
we
ceased
concentrating
on
the
result
of
mental
illnesses
and
learned
to
attack
the
causes
it
the
old
yellow
fever
problem
all
over
again
you
see
once
upon
a
time
physicians
dealt
exclusively
with
treatment
of
yellow
fever
patients
then
they
shifted
their
attention
to
the
of
the
disease
they
went
after
the
mosquitoes
drained
the
swamps
and
the
yellow
fever
problem
vanished
that
been
our
approach
in
recent
years
we
developed
therapy
and
so
the
need
for
individual
therapy
has
diminished
what
were
the
sources
of
the
tensions
producing
mental
disturbances
physical
and
financial
insecurity
the
threat
of
war
the
aggressive
patterns
of
a
competitive
society
the
unresolved
rooted
in
the
family
relationship
these
were
the
swamps
where
the
mosquitoes
buzzed
and
bit
most
of
the
swamps
have
been
dredged
most
of
the
insects
exterminated
today
we
moving
into
a
social
situation
where
nobody
goes
hungry
nobody
is
jobless
or
unprovided
for
nobody
needs
to
struggle
for
status
vocational
apt
determines
a
man
rightful
place
and
function
in
society
and
there
no
longer
the
artificial
distinction
imposed
by
race
color
or
creed
war
is
a
thing
of
the
past
best
of
all
the
with
all
of
its
unhealthy
emotional
ties
is
being
replaced
by
sensible
conditioning
when
a
child
reaches
school
age
the
umbilical
cord
is
no
longer
a
permanent
leash
a
noose
or
a
stretching
back
to
the
womb
harry
collins
nodded
i
suppose
only
the
exceptional
cases
ever
need
to
go
to
a
treatment
center
like
this
exactly
but
what
makes
one
of
the
exceptions
is
it
because
of
the
way
the
folks
brought
me
up
in
a
small
town
with
all
the
books
and
everything
is
that
why
i
hated
confinement
and
conformity
so
much
is
it
because
of
all
the
years
i
spent
reading
and
why
manschoff
stood
up
you
tempt
me
he
said
you
tempt
me
strongly
as
you
can
see
i
dearly
love
a
lecture
and
a
captive
audience
but
right
now
the
audience
must
not
remain
captive
i
prescribe
an
immediate
dose
of
freedom
you
mean
i
to
leave
here
is
that
what
you
want
to
do
frankly
no
not
if
it
means
going
back
to
my
job
that
has
been
decided
upon
we
can
discuss
the
problem
later
and
perhaps
we
can
go
into
the
answers
to
those
questions
you
just
posed
but
at
the
moment
i
suggest
you
stay
with
us
though
without
the
restraint
of
remaining
in
your
room
or
in
the
wards
in
other
words
i
want
you
to
start
going
outside
again
outside
you
find
several
square
miles
of
open
country
just
beyond
the
doors
here
you
at
liberty
to
wander
around
and
enjoy
yourself
plenty
of
fresh
air
and
sunshine
come
and
go
as
you
wish
already
issued
instructions
which
permit
you
to
keep
your
own
hours
meals
will
be
available
when
you
desire
them
you
very
kind
nonsense
i
prescribing
what
you
need
and
when
the
time
comes
we
arrange
to
talk
again
you
know
where
to
find
me
manschoff
dismantled
his
steeple
and
placed
a
half
of
the
roof
in
each
and
harry
collins
went
outdoors
it
was
wonderful
just
to
be
free
and
alone
like
returning
to
that
faraway
childhood
in
wheaton
once
again
harry
appreciated
every
minute
of
it
during
the
first
week
of
his
wandering
but
harry
was
a
child
any
more
and
after
a
week
he
began
to
wonder
instead
of
wander
the
grounds
around
the
treatment
center
were
more
than
spacious
they
seemed
absolutely
endless
no
matter
how
far
he
walked
during
the
course
of
a
day
harry
had
never
encountered
any
walls
fences
or
artificial
barriers
there
was
nothing
to
stay
his
progress
but
the
natural
barriers
of
high
precipices
which
seemed
to
rim
all
sides
of
a
vast
valley
apparently
the
center
itself
was
set
in
the
middle
of
a
large
canyon
a
canyon
big
enough
to
contain
an
airstrip
for
helicopter
landings
the
single
paved
road
leading
from
the
main
buildings
terminated
at
the
airstrip
and
harry
saw
helicopters
arrive
and
depart
from
time
to
time
apparently
they
brought
in
food
and
supplies
as
for
the
center
itself
it
consisted
of
four
large
structures
two
of
which
harry
was
familiar
with
the
largest
was
made
up
of
apartments
for
individual
patients
and
staffed
by
nurses
and
attendants
harry
own
room
was
here
on
the
second
floor
and
from
the
beginning
he
been
allowed
to
roam
around
the
communal
halls
below
at
will
the
second
building
was
obviously
administrative
private
office
was
situated
therein
and
presumably
the
other
operated
out
of
here
the
other
two
buildings
were
apparently
inaccessible
not
guarded
or
policed
or
even
distinguished
by
signs
prohibiting
access
but
merely
locked
and
unused
at
least
harry
had
found
the
doors
locked
when
out
of
normal
curiosity
he
had
ventured
to
approach
them
nor
had
he
ever
seen
anyone
enter
or
leave
the
premises
perhaps
these
structures
were
unnecessary
under
the
present
circumstances
and
had
been
built
for
future
accommodations
still
harry
could
help
wondering
and
now
on
this
particular
afternoon
he
sat
on
the
bank
of
the
little
river
which
ran
through
the
valley
feeling
the
sun
beating
down
upon
his
forehead
and
staring
down
at
the
eddying
current
with
its
ripples
and
reflections
and
reflections
manschoff
had
answered
his
questions
well
yet
new
questions
had
arisen
most
people
did
go
crazy
any
more
the
doctor
had
explained
and
so
there
were
very
few
treatment
centers
such
as
this
why
were
there
any
at
all
a
place
like
this
cost
a
fortune
to
staff
and
maintain
in
an
age
where
and
areable
acreage
was
at
such
a
premium
why
waste
this
vast
and
fertile
expanse
and
in
a
society
more
and
more
openly
committed
to
the
policy
of
promoting
the
greatest
good
for
the
greatest
number
why
bother
about
the
fate
of
an
admittedly
insignificant
group
of
mentally
disturbed
patients
not
that
harry
resented
his
situation
in
fact
it
was
almost
too
good
to
be
true
was
it
too
good
to
be
true
why
come
to
realize
it
he
seen
less
than
a
dozen
other
patients
during
his
entire
stay
here
all
of
them
were
male
and
all
of
them
apparently
were
recovering
from
a
condition
somewhat
similar
to
his
own
at
least
he
recognized
the
same
reticence
and
diffidence
when
it
came
to
exchanging
more
than
a
perfunctory
greeting
in
an
encounter
in
an
outer
corridor
at
the
time
he
accepted
their
unwillingness
to
communicate
welcomed
and
understood
it
because
of
condition
and
that
in
itself
was
what
he
questioned
now
but
why
were
there
so
patients
beside
himself
why
were
they
all
males
and
why
were
roaming
the
countryside
now
the
way
he
was
so
many
and
so
few
patients
so
much
room
and
luxury
and
freedom
and
so
little
use
of
it
so
little
apparent
purpose
to
it
all
was
there
a
hidden
purpose
harry
stared
down
into
the
ripples
and
reflections
and
the
sun
was
suddenly
intolerably
hot
its
glare
on
the
water
suddenly
blinding
and
bewildering
he
saw
his
face
mirrored
on
the
water
surface
and
it
was
not
the
familiar
countenance
he
knew
the
features
were
bloated
distorted
shimmering
and
wavering
maybe
it
was
starting
all
over
again
maybe
he
was
getting
another
one
of
those
headaches
maybe
he
was
going
to
lose
control
again
yes
and
maybe
he
was
just
imagining
things
sitting
here
in
all
this
heat
was
a
good
idea
why
not
take
a
swim
that
seemed
reasonable
enough
in
fact
it
seemed
like
a
delightful
distraction
harry
rose
and
stripped
he
entered
the
water
awkwardly
one
did
dive
not
after
twenty
years
of
abstinence
from
the
outdoor
life
but
he
found
that
he
could
swim
after
a
fashion
the
water
was
cooling
soothing
a
few
minutes
of
immersion
and
harry
found
himself
forgetting
his
speculations
the
uneasy
feeling
had
vanished
now
when
he
stared
down
into
the
water
he
saw
his
own
face
reflected
looking
just
the
way
it
should
and
when
he
stared
up
he
saw
her
standing
there
on
the
bank
she
was
tall
slim
and
blonde
very
tall
very
slim
and
very
blonde
she
was
also
very
desirable
up
until
a
moment
ago
harry
had
considered
swimming
a
delightful
distraction
but
now
how
the
water
she
called
fine
she
nodded
smiling
down
at
him
are
you
coming
in
he
asked
no
then
what
are
you
doing
here
i
was
looking
for
you
harry
you
know
my
name
she
nodded
again
manschoff
told
me
you
mean
he
sent
you
here
to
find
me
that
right
but
i
do
understand
if
you
not
going
swimming
then
why
i
mean
her
smile
broadened
it
just
part
of
the
therapy
harry
part
of
the
therapy
that
right
she
giggled
do
you
think
you
like
to
come
out
of
the
water
now
and
see
what
the
rest
of
it
might
be
harry
thought
so
with
mounting
enthusiasm
he
eagerly
embraced
his
treatment
and
entered
into
a
state
of
active
cooperation
it
was
some
time
before
he
ventured
to
comment
on
the
situation
manschoff
is
a
damned
good
diagnostician
he
murmured
then
he
sat
up
are
you
a
patient
here
she
shook
her
head
do
ask
questions
harry
ca
you
be
satisfied
with
things
as
they
are
you
just
what
the
doctor
ordered
all
right
he
gazed
down
at
her
but
do
you
even
have
a
name
you
can
call
me
sue
thank
you
he
bent
to
kiss
her
but
she
avoided
him
and
rose
to
her
feet
got
to
go
now
so
soon
she
nodded
and
moved
towards
the
bushes
above
the
bank
but
when
will
i
see
you
again
coming
swimming
tomorrow
yes
maybe
i
can
get
away
for
more
occupational
therapy
then
she
stooped
behind
the
bushes
and
harry
saw
a
flash
of
white
you
a
nurse
are
you
he
muttered
on
the
staff
i
suppose
i
should
have
known
all
right
so
i
am
what
that
got
to
do
with
it
and
i
suppose
you
were
telling
the
truth
when
you
said
manschoff
sent
you
here
this
just
part
of
my
therapy
is
it
she
nodded
briefly
as
she
slipped
into
her
uniform
does
that
bother
you
harry
he
bit
his
lip
when
he
spoke
his
voice
was
low
yes
damn
it
it
does
i
mean
i
got
the
idea
at
least
i
was
hoping
that
this
just
a
matter
of
carrying
out
an
assignment
on
your
part
she
looked
up
at
him
gravely
who
said
anything
about
an
assignment
darling
she
murmured
i
volunteered
and
then
she
was
gone
then
she
was
gone
and
then
she
came
back
that
night
in
dreams
and
then
she
was
at
the
river
the
next
day
and
it
was
better
than
the
dreams
better
than
the
day
before
sue
told
him
she
had
been
watching
him
for
weeks
now
and
she
had
gone
to
manschoff
and
suggested
it
and
she
was
very
glad
and
they
had
to
meet
here
out
in
the
open
so
as
not
to
complicate
the
situation
or
disturb
any
of
the
other
patients
so
harry
naturally
asked
her
about
the
other
patients
and
the
whole
general
setup
and
she
said
manschoff
would
answer
all
those
questions
in
due
time
but
right
now
with
only
an
hour
or
so
to
spare
was
he
going
to
spend
it
all
asking
for
information
matters
were
accordingly
adjusted
to
their
mutual
satisfaction
and
it
was
on
that
basis
that
they
continued
their
almost
daily
meetings
for
some
time
the
next
few
months
were
perhaps
the
happiest
harry
had
ever
known
the
whole
interval
took
on
a
dreamlike
quality
idealized
romanticized
yet
basically
sensual
there
is
probably
such
a
dream
buried
deep
within
the
psyche
of
every
man
harry
reflected
but
to
few
is
it
ever
given
to
realize
its
reality
his
early
questioning
attitude
gave
way
to
a
mood
of
mere
acceptance
and
enjoyment
this
was
the
primitive
drama
the
very
essence
of
the
relationship
adam
and
eve
in
the
garden
why
waste
time
seeking
the
tree
of
knowledge
and
it
was
until
summer
passed
that
harry
even
thought
about
the
serpent
one
afternoon
as
he
sat
waiting
for
sue
on
the
river
bank
he
heard
a
sudden
movement
in
the
brush
behind
him
darling
he
called
eagerly
please
you
do
know
me
well
the
deep
masculine
voice
carried
overtones
of
amusement
flushing
harry
turned
to
confront
the
intruder
he
was
a
short
stocky
man
whose
bristling
gray
crewcut
almost
matched
the
neutral
shades
of
his
gray
orderly
uniform
expecting
someone
else
were
you
the
man
muttered
well
i
get
out
of
your
way
that
not
necessary
i
was
really
just
daydreaming
i
guess
i
know
what
made
me
think
harry
felt
his
flush
deepen
and
he
lowered
his
eyes
and
his
voice
as
he
tried
to
improvise
some
excuse
you
a
lousy
liar
the
man
said
stepping
forward
and
seating
himself
on
the
bank
next
to
harry
but
it
does
really
matter
i
do
think
your
girl
friend
is
going
to
show
up
today
anyway
what
do
you
mean
what
do
you
know
about
i
mean
just
what
i
said
the
man
told
him
and
i
know
everything
i
need
to
know
about
you
and
about
her
and
about
the
situation
in
general
that
why
i
here
collins
he
paused
watching
the
play
of
emotions
in
harry
eyes
i
know
what
you
thinking
right
now
the
man
continued
at
first
you
wondered
how
i
knew
your
name
then
you
realized
that
if
i
was
on
the
staff
in
the
wards
i
naturally
be
able
to
identify
the
patients
now
it
occurs
to
you
that
you
never
seen
me
in
the
wards
so
you
speculating
as
to
whether
or
not
working
out
of
the
administration
offices
with
that
psychiatric
no
good
manschoff
but
if
i
were
i
would
be
calling
him
names
would
i
which
means
you
really
getting
confused
are
you
collins
good
the
man
chuckled
but
there
was
neither
mockery
malice
nor
genuine
mirth
in
the
sound
and
his
eyes
were
sober
intent
who
are
you
harry
asked
what
are
you
doing
here
the
name
is
ritchie
arnold
ritchie
at
least
that
the
name
they
know
me
by
around
here
and
you
can
call
me
that
as
to
what
doing
it
a
long
story
let
just
say
that
right
now
i
here
to
give
you
a
little
advanced
therapy
then
manschoff
did
send
you
the
chuckle
came
again
and
ritchie
shook
his
head
he
did
not
and
if
he
even
suspected
i
was
here
there
be
hell
to
pay
then
what
do
you
want
with
me
it
is
a
question
of
what
i
want
it
a
question
of
what
which
is
like
i
said
advanced
therapy
the
sort
that
dear
old
kindly
permissive
manschoff
does
intend
you
to
get
harry
stood
up
what
this
all
about
ritchie
rose
with
him
smiling
for
the
first
time
i
glad
you
asked
that
question
collins
it
about
time
you
did
you
know
everything
has
been
so
carefully
planned
to
keep
you
from
asking
it
but
you
beginning
to
wonder
just
a
bit
anyway
were
you
i
do
see
what
you
driving
at
you
do
see
what
anyone
is
driving
at
collins
you
been
blinded
by
a
spectacular
display
of
kindness
misdirected
by
i
told
you
i
knew
everything
i
needed
to
know
about
you
and
i
do
now
i
going
to
ask
you
to
remember
these
things
for
yourself
the
things
you
avoided
considering
all
this
while
i
going
to
ask
you
to
remember
that
you
years
old
and
that
for
almost
seven
years
you
were
an
agency
man
and
a
good
one
you
worked
hard
you
did
a
conscientious
job
you
stayed
in
line
obeyed
the
rules
never
rebelled
am
i
correct
in
my
summary
of
the
situation
yes
i
guess
so
so
what
was
your
reward
for
all
this
unceasing
effort
and
eternal
conformity
a
apartment
and
a
vacation
once
a
year
count
your
blessings
collins
am
i
right
right
then
what
happened
finally
you
flipped
did
you
tried
to
take
a
header
out
of
the
window
you
chucked
your
job
chucked
your
responsibilities
chucked
your
future
and
attempted
to
chuck
yourself
away
am
i
still
right
yes
good
enough
and
now
we
come
to
the
interesting
part
of
the
story
seven
years
of
being
a
good
little
boy
got
you
nothing
but
the
promise
of
present
and
future
frustration
seven
seconds
of
madness
of
attempted
brought
you
here
and
as
a
reward
for
bucking
the
system
the
system
itself
has
provided
you
with
a
life
of
luxury
and
leisure
full
permission
to
come
and
go
as
you
please
live
in
spacious
ease
indulge
in
the
gratification
of
every
appetite
free
of
responsibility
or
restraint
is
that
true
i
suppose
so
all
right
now
let
me
ask
you
the
question
you
asked
me
what
it
all
about
ritchie
put
his
hand
on
harry
shoulder
tell
me
that
collins
why
do
you
suppose
you
received
such
treatment
as
long
as
you
stayed
in
line
nobody
gave
a
damn
for
your
comfort
or
welfare
then
when
you
committed
the
cardinal
sin
of
our
society
when
you
rebelled
everything
was
handed
to
you
on
a
silver
platter
does
that
make
sense
but
it
therapy
manschoff
said
look
collins
millions
of
people
flip
every
year
millions
more
attempt
suicide
how
many
of
them
end
up
in
a
place
like
this
they
do
though
that
just
naturalist
propaganda
manschoff
said
manschoff
said
i
know
what
he
said
all
right
and
you
believed
him
because
you
wanted
to
believe
him
you
wanted
the
reassurance
he
could
offer
you
the
feeling
of
being
unique
and
important
so
you
did
ask
him
any
questions
you
did
ask
any
questions
of
yourself
such
as
why
anybody
would
consider
an
insignificant
little
agency
man
without
friends
family
or
connections
worth
the
trouble
of
rehabilitating
at
all
let
alone
amidst
such
elaborate
and
expensive
surroundings
why
men
like
you
are
a
dime
a
dozen
these
days
vocational
apt
can
push
a
few
buttons
and
come
up
with
half
a
million
replacements
to
take
over
your
job
you
are
important
to
society
collins
you
are
important
to
anyone
at
all
besides
yourself
and
yet
you
got
the
treatment
it
about
time
somebody
yanked
that
carpet
out
from
under
you
what
it
all
about
harry
blinked
look
here
i
do
see
why
this
is
any
of
your
business
besides
to
tell
the
truth
i
expecting
i
know
who
you
expecting
but
i
already
told
you
she
wo
be
here
because
she
expecting
what
it
high
time
you
learned
the
facts
of
life
collins
yes
the
facts
of
life
the
ones
about
the
birds
and
the
bees
and
barefoot
boys
and
blondes
too
your
little
friend
sue
is
going
to
have
a
souvenir
i
do
believe
it
i
going
to
ask
dr
manschoff
sure
you
are
you
ask
manschoff
and
he
deny
it
and
so
tell
him
about
me
you
say
you
met
somebody
in
the
woods
today
either
a
lunatic
or
a
naturalist
spy
who
infiltrated
here
under
false
pretenses
and
manschoff
will
reassure
you
he
reassure
you
just
long
enough
to
get
his
hands
on
me
then
he
take
care
of
both
of
us
are
you
insinuating
hell
no
i
you
ritchie
put
his
hand
down
suddenly
and
his
voice
calmed
ever
wonder
about
those
other
two
big
buildings
on
the
premises
here
collins
well
i
can
tell
you
about
one
of
them
because
that
where
i
work
you
might
call
it
an
experimental
laboratory
if
you
like
sometime
later
on
i
describe
it
to
you
but
right
now
it
the
other
building
that
important
the
building
with
the
big
chimney
that
a
kind
of
an
incinerator
collins
a
place
where
the
mistakes
go
up
in
smoke
at
night
when
there
nobody
to
see
a
place
where
you
and
i
will
go
up
in
smoke
if
you
fool
enough
to
tell
manschoff
about
this
you
lying
i
wish
to
god
i
was
for
both
our
sakes
but
i
can
prove
what
saying
can
prove
it
for
yourself
how
pretend
this
meeting
never
occurred
pretend
that
you
just
spent
the
afternoon
here
waiting
for
a
girl
who
never
showed
up
then
do
exactly
what
you
would
do
under
those
circumstances
go
in
to
see
manschoff
and
ask
him
where
sue
is
tell
him
you
were
worried
because
she
promised
to
meet
you
and
then
did
appear
i
can
tell
you
right
now
what
he
tell
you
he
say
that
sue
has
been
transferred
to
another
treatment
center
that
she
knew
about
it
for
several
weeks
but
did
want
to
upset
you
with
the
news
of
her
departure
so
she
decided
to
just
slip
away
and
manschoff
will
tell
you
not
to
be
unhappy
it
just
so
happens
that
he
knows
of
another
nurse
who
has
had
her
eye
on
you
a
very
pretty
little
brunette
named
myrna
in
fact
if
you
go
down
to
the
river
tomorrow
you
find
her
waiting
for
you
there
what
if
i
refuse
ritchie
shrugged
why
should
you
refuse
it
all
fun
and
games
is
it
up
to
now
you
have
asked
any
questions
about
what
was
going
on
and
it
would
look
very
strange
if
you
started
at
this
late
date
i
strongly
advise
you
to
cooperate
if
not
everything
is
likely
to
quite
literally
go
up
in
smoke
harry
collins
frowned
all
right
suppose
i
do
what
you
say
and
manschoff
gives
me
the
answers
you
predict
this
still
does
prove
that
he
be
lying
or
that
you
telling
me
the
truth
would
it
indicate
as
much
though
perhaps
but
on
the
other
hand
it
could
merely
mean
that
you
know
sue
been
transferred
and
that
manschoff
intends
to
turn
me
over
to
a
substitute
it
does
necessarily
imply
anything
sinister
in
other
words
you
insisting
on
a
clincher
is
that
it
yes
all
right
ritchie
sighed
heavily
you
asked
for
it
he
reached
into
the
upper
pocket
of
the
gray
uniform
and
brought
out
a
small
stiff
square
of
glossy
paper
what
that
harry
asked
he
reached
for
the
paper
but
ritchie
drew
his
hand
back
look
at
it
over
my
shoulder
he
said
i
do
want
any
fingerprints
hell
of
a
risky
business
just
smuggling
it
out
of
the
files
no
telling
how
well
they
check
up
on
this
material
harry
circled
behind
the
smaller
man
he
squinted
down
hard
to
read
sure
it
a
photostat
i
made
it
myself
this
morning
that
my
department
read
carefully
now
you
see
it
a
transcript
of
the
lab
report
susan
pulver
that
her
name
is
it
after
due
examination
and
upon
completion
of
preliminary
tests
hereby
found
to
be
in
the
second
month
of
pregnancy
putative
father
harry
collins
that
you
see
your
name
and
here
the
rest
of
the
record
yes
let
me
see
it
what
all
this
about
inoculation
series
and
who
is
this
dr
leffingwell
harry
bent
closer
but
ritchie
closed
his
hand
around
the
photostat
and
pocketed
it
again
never
mind
that
now
i
tell
you
later
the
important
thing
is
do
you
believe
me
i
believe
sue
is
pregnant
yes
that
enough
enough
for
you
to
do
what
i
asked
you
to
go
to
manschoff
and
make
inquiries
see
what
he
tells
you
do
make
a
scene
and
for
god
sake
do
mention
my
name
just
confirm
my
story
for
yourself
then
i
give
you
further
details
but
when
will
i
see
you
tomorrow
afternoon
if
you
like
right
here
you
said
he
be
sending
another
girl
ritchie
nodded
so
i
did
and
so
he
say
i
suggest
you
beg
to
be
excused
for
the
moment
tell
him
it
will
take
a
while
for
you
to
get
over
the
shock
of
losing
sue
this
way
i
wo
be
lying
harry
murmured
i
know
and
i
sorry
believe
me
i
am
ritchie
sighed
again
but
you
just
have
to
trust
me
from
now
on
trust
you
when
you
have
even
explained
what
this
is
all
about
you
had
your
for
today
come
back
for
another
treatment
tomorrow
and
then
ritchie
was
gone
the
gray
uniform
melting
away
into
the
gray
shadows
of
the
shrubbery
above
the
bank
a
short
time
later
harry
made
his
own
way
back
to
the
center
in
the
gathering
twilight
the
dusk
was
gray
too
everything
seemed
gray
now
so
was
harry
collins
face
when
he
emerged
from
his
interview
with
manschoff
that
evening
and
it
was
still
pallid
the
next
afternoon
when
he
came
down
to
the
river
bank
and
waited
for
ritchie
to
reappear
the
little
man
emerged
from
the
bushes
he
stared
at
harry
drawn
countenance
and
nodded
slowly
i
was
right
eh
he
muttered
it
looks
that
way
but
i
ca
understand
what
going
on
if
this
is
just
a
treatment
center
if
they
not
really
interested
in
my
welfare
then
what
am
i
doing
here
you
taking
part
in
an
experiment
this
my
friend
is
a
laboratory
and
you
are
a
nice
healthy
guinea
pig
but
that
does
make
sense
i
have
been
experimented
on
let
me
do
as
i
please
exactly
and
what
do
guinea
pigs
excel
at
you
mean
this
whole
thing
was
rigged
up
just
so
that
sue
and
i
would
please
let
not
be
so
egocentric
shall
we
after
all
you
not
the
male
patient
in
this
place
there
are
a
dozen
others
wandering
around
loose
some
of
them
have
their
favorite
caves
others
have
discovered
little
bypaths
but
all
of
them
seem
to
have
located
ideal
whereupon
of
course
the
volunteer
nurses
have
located
are
you
telling
me
the
same
situation
exists
with
each
of
the
others
is
it
fairly
obvious
you
shown
no
inclination
to
become
friendly
with
the
rest
of
the
patients
here
and
none
of
them
have
made
any
overtures
to
you
that
because
everyone
has
his
own
little
secret
his
own
private
arrangement
and
so
all
of
you
go
around
fooling
everybody
else
and
all
of
you
are
being
fooled
i
give
credit
to
manschoff
and
his
staff
on
that
point
he
certainly
mastered
the
principles
of
practical
psychology
but
you
talked
about
breeding
with
our
present
overpopulation
problem
why
in
the
world
do
they
deliberately
encourage
the
birth
of
more
children
very
well
put
in
the
world
indeed
in
order
to
answer
that
you
better
take
a
good
look
at
the
world
arnold
ritchie
seated
himself
on
the
grass
pulled
out
a
pipe
and
then
replaced
it
hastily
better
not
smoke
he
murmured
be
awkward
if
we
attracted
any
attention
and
were
found
together
harry
stared
at
him
you
a
naturalist
are
you
i
a
reporter
by
profession
which
network
no
network
there
are
still
a
few
in
print
you
know
i
know
but
i
ca
afford
them
there
are
many
left
who
can
or
who
even
feel
the
need
of
reading
them
nevertheless
mavericks
like
myself
still
cling
to
the
ancient
and
honorable
practices
of
the
fourth
estate
one
of
which
is
ferreting
out
the
inside
story
the
news
behind
the
news
then
you
not
working
for
the
naturalists
of
course
i
am
i
working
for
them
and
for
everybody
else
who
has
an
interest
in
learning
the
truth
ritchie
paused
by
the
way
you
keep
using
that
term
as
if
it
were
some
kind
of
dirty
word
just
what
does
it
mean
what
a
naturalist
in
your
book
why
a
radical
thinker
of
course
an
opponent
of
government
policies
of
progress
one
who
believes
we
running
out
of
living
space
using
up
the
last
of
our
natural
resources
what
do
you
suppose
motivates
naturalists
really
well
they
ca
stand
the
pressures
of
daily
living
or
the
prospects
of
a
future
when
we
be
still
more
hemmed
in
ritchie
nodded
any
more
than
you
could
a
few
months
ago
when
you
tried
to
commit
suicide
would
you
say
that
were
thinking
like
a
naturalist
then
harry
grimaced
i
suppose
so
do
feel
ashamed
you
saw
the
situation
clearly
just
as
the
naturalists
do
and
just
as
the
government
does
only
the
government
ca
dare
admit
it
hence
the
secrecy
behind
this
project
a
government
plan
to
stimulate
further
breeding
i
still
do
see
look
at
the
world
ritchie
repeated
look
at
it
realistically
what
the
situation
at
present
population
close
to
six
billion
and
rising
fast
there
was
a
period
in
the
sixties
and
then
it
started
to
climb
again
no
wars
no
disease
to
cut
it
down
the
development
of
synthetic
foods
the
use
of
algae
and
fungi
rules
out
famine
as
a
limiting
factor
increased
harnessing
of
atomic
power
has
done
away
with
widespread
poverty
so
there
no
economic
deterrent
to
propagation
neither
church
nor
state
dares
set
up
a
legal
prohibition
so
here
we
are
at
the
millennium
in
place
of
international
tension
we
substituted
internal
tension
in
place
of
thermonuclear
explosion
we
have
a
population
explosion
you
make
it
look
pretty
grim
i
just
talking
about
today
what
happens
ten
years
from
now
when
we
hit
a
of
ten
billion
what
happens
when
we
reach
twenty
billion
fifty
billion
a
hundred
do
talk
to
me
about
more
substitutes
more
synthetics
new
ways
of
conserving
there
just
is
going
to
be
for
everyone
then
what
the
answer
that
what
the
government
wants
to
know
believe
me
they
done
a
lot
of
searching
most
of
it
and
then
along
came
this
man
leffingwell
with
solution
that
just
what
it
is
of
course
an
endocrinological
solution
for
direct
injection
leffingwell
the
leffingwell
whose
name
was
on
that
photostat
what
he
got
to
do
with
all
this
he
boss
of
this
project
ritchie
said
he
the
one
who
persuaded
them
to
set
up
a
you
guinea
pig
but
why
all
the
secrecy
that
what
i
wanted
to
know
that
why
i
scurried
around
pulled
strings
to
get
a
lab
technician
job
here
it
was
easy
believe
me
the
whole
deal
is
being
kept
strictly
under
wraps
until
leffingwell
experiments
prove
out
they
realized
right
away
that
it
would
be
fatal
to
use
volunteers
for
the
experiments
they
be
bound
to
talk
there
be
leaks
and
of
course
they
anticipated
some
awkward
results
at
first
until
the
technique
is
refined
and
perfected
well
they
were
right
on
that
score
i
seen
some
of
their
failures
ritchie
shuddered
any
volunteer
any
military
man
government
employee
or
even
a
dedicated
scientist
who
broke
away
would
spread
enough
rumors
about
what
was
going
on
to
kill
the
entire
project
that
why
they
decided
to
use
mental
patients
for
subjects
god
knows
they
had
millions
to
choose
from
but
they
were
very
particular
you
a
rare
specimen
collins
how
so
because
you
happen
to
fit
all
their
specifications
you
young
in
good
physical
condition
unlike
ninety
percent
of
the
population
you
do
even
wear
contact
lenses
do
you
and
your
aberration
was
temporary
easily
removed
by
removing
you
from
the
which
created
it
you
have
no
family
ties
no
close
friends
to
question
your
absence
that
why
you
were
chosen
one
of
the
two
hundred
two
hundred
but
there
only
a
dozen
others
here
now
a
dozen
males
yes
you
forgetting
the
females
must
be
about
fifty
or
sixty
in
the
other
building
but
if
you
talking
about
someone
like
sue
she
a
nurse
ritchie
shook
his
head
that
what
she
was
to
say
actually
she
a
patient
too
they
all
patients
twelve
men
and
sixty
women
at
the
moment
originally
about
thirty
men
and
a
hundred
and
seventy
women
what
happened
to
the
others
i
told
you
there
were
some
failures
many
of
the
women
died
in
childbirth
some
of
them
survived
but
found
out
about
the
results
and
the
results
up
until
now
have
been
perfect
a
few
of
the
men
found
out
too
well
they
have
only
one
method
of
dealing
with
failures
here
they
dispose
of
them
i
told
you
about
that
chimney
did
i
you
mean
they
killed
the
offspring
killed
those
who
found
out
about
them
ritchie
shrugged
but
what
are
they
actually
who
is
this
leffingwell
what
it
all
about
i
think
i
can
answer
those
questions
for
you
harry
wheeled
at
the
sound
of
the
familiar
voice
manschoff
beamed
down
at
him
from
the
top
of
the
river
bank
do
be
alarmed
he
said
i
was
following
you
with
any
intent
to
eavesdrop
i
was
merely
concerned
about
him
his
eyes
flickered
as
he
directed
his
gaze
past
harry
shoulder
and
harry
turned
again
to
look
at
arnold
ritchie
the
little
man
was
no
longer
standing
and
he
was
no
longer
alone
two
attendants
now
supported
him
one
on
either
side
and
ritchie
himself
sagged
against
their
grip
with
eyes
closed
a
hypodermic
needle
in
one
attendant
hand
indicated
the
reason
for
ritchie
sudden
collapse
merely
a
heavy
sedative
manschoff
murmured
we
came
prepared
in
expectation
of
just
such
an
emergency
he
nodded
at
his
companions
better
take
him
back
now
he
said
i
look
in
on
him
this
evening
when
he
comes
out
of
it
sorry
about
all
this
manschoff
continued
sitting
down
next
to
harry
as
the
orderlies
lifted
ritchie
inert
form
and
carried
him
up
the
slanting
slope
it
entirely
my
fault
i
misjudged
my
patient
never
should
have
permitted
him
such
a
degree
of
freedom
obviously
he
not
ready
for
it
yet
i
do
hope
he
did
upset
you
in
any
way
no
he
seemed
quite
harry
hesitated
then
went
on
hastily
logical
indeed
he
is
manschoff
smiled
paranoid
delusions
as
they
used
to
call
them
can
often
be
rationalized
most
convincingly
and
from
what
little
i
heard
he
was
doing
an
excellent
job
was
he
well
i
know
a
slight
sigh
erased
the
smile
leffingwell
and
i
are
mad
scientists
conducting
biological
experiments
on
human
guinea
pigs
we
assembled
patients
for
breeding
purposes
and
the
government
is
secretly
subsidizing
us
also
we
incinerate
our
victims
again
with
full
governmental
permission
all
very
logical
is
it
i
did
mean
that
harry
told
him
it
just
that
he
said
sue
was
pregnant
and
he
was
hinting
things
said
manschoff
stood
up
i
surprised
he
did
go
further
than
that
just
today
we
discovered
he
been
using
the
office
facilities
he
had
a
sort
of
probationary
position
as
you
may
have
guessed
helping
out
the
staff
in
administration
to
provide
tangible
proof
of
his
artistic
creations
he
was
writing
out
reports
and
then
photostating
them
apparently
he
intended
to
circulate
the
results
as
to
support
his
delusions
look
here
a
sample
manschoff
passed
a
square
of
glossy
paper
to
harry
who
scanned
it
quickly
it
was
another
laboratory
report
similar
to
the
one
ritchie
had
shown
him
but
containing
a
different
set
of
names
no
telling
how
long
this
sort
of
thing
has
been
going
on
manschoff
said
he
may
have
made
dozens
naturally
the
moment
we
discovered
it
we
realized
prompt
action
was
necessary
he
need
special
attention
but
what
wrong
with
him
it
a
long
story
he
was
a
reporter
at
one
time
he
may
have
told
you
that
the
death
of
his
wife
precipitated
a
severe
trauma
and
brought
him
to
our
attention
actually
i
not
at
liberty
to
say
any
more
regarding
his
case
you
understand
i
sure
then
you
telling
me
that
everything
he
had
to
say
was
a
product
of
his
imagination
no
do
misunderstand
it
would
be
more
correct
to
state
that
he
merely
distorted
reality
for
example
there
a
leffingwell
on
the
staff
here
he
is
a
diagnostician
and
has
nothing
to
do
with
psychotherapy
and
he
has
charge
of
the
hospital
ward
in
unit
three
the
third
building
you
may
have
noticed
behind
administration
that
where
the
nurses
maintain
residence
of
course
incidentally
when
any
nurses
take
on
a
special
assignment
as
it
were
such
as
yours
leffingwell
does
examine
and
treat
them
there
a
new
oral
contraception
technique
he
evolved
which
may
be
quite
efficacious
but
i
hardly
call
it
an
example
of
sinister
experimentation
under
the
circumstances
would
you
harry
shook
his
head
about
ritchie
though
he
said
what
will
happen
to
him
i
ca
offer
any
prognosis
in
view
of
my
recent
error
in
judgment
concerning
him
it
hard
to
say
how
he
respond
to
further
treatment
but
rest
assured
that
i
do
my
best
for
his
case
chances
are
you
be
seeing
him
again
before
very
long
manschoff
glanced
at
his
watch
shall
we
go
back
now
he
suggested
supper
will
be
served
soon
the
two
men
toiled
up
the
bank
harry
discovered
that
the
doctor
was
right
about
supper
it
was
being
served
as
he
returned
to
his
room
but
the
predictions
concerning
ritchie
did
work
out
quite
as
well
it
was
after
supper
indeed
quite
some
hours
afterwards
while
harry
sat
at
his
window
and
stared
sleeplessly
out
into
the
night
that
he
noted
the
thick
greasy
spirals
of
black
smoke
rising
suddenly
from
the
chimney
of
the
third
unit
building
and
the
sight
may
have
prepared
him
for
the
failure
of
manschoff
prophecy
regarding
his
disturbed
patient
harry
never
asked
any
questions
and
no
explanations
were
ever
forthcoming
but
from
that
evening
onward
nobody
ever
saw
arnold
ritchie
again
president
winthrop
the
secretary
of
state
closed
the
door
well
he
asked
president
winthrop
looked
up
from
the
desk
and
blinked
hello
art
he
said
sit
down
sorry
i
late
the
secretary
told
him
i
came
as
soon
as
i
got
the
call
it
does
matter
the
president
lit
a
cigarette
and
pursed
his
lips
around
it
until
it
stopped
wobbling
i
been
checking
the
reports
all
night
you
look
tired
i
am
i
could
sleep
for
a
week
that
is
i
i
could
any
luck
the
president
pushed
the
papers
aside
and
drummed
the
desk
for
a
moment
then
he
offered
the
secretary
a
gray
ghost
of
a
smile
the
answer
still
the
same
but
this
was
our
last
chance
i
know
the
president
leaned
back
when
i
think
of
the
time
and
effort
the
money
that
been
poured
into
these
projects
to
say
nothing
of
the
hopes
we
had
and
now
it
all
for
nothing
you
ca
say
that
the
secretary
answered
after
all
we
did
reach
the
moon
we
got
to
mars
he
paused
no
one
can
take
that
away
from
you
you
sponsored
the
martian
flights
you
fought
for
the
appropriations
pushed
the
project
carried
it
through
you
helped
mankind
realize
its
greatest
dream
save
that
for
the
newscasts
the
president
said
the
fact
remains
we
succeeded
and
our
success
was
a
failure
mankind
greatest
dream
eh
read
these
reports
and
you
find
out
this
is
greatest
nightmare
is
it
that
bad
yes
the
president
slumped
in
his
chair
it
that
bad
we
can
reach
the
moon
at
will
now
we
can
send
a
manned
flight
to
mars
but
it
means
nothing
we
ca
support
life
in
either
place
absolutely
no
possibility
of
establishing
or
maintaining
an
outpost
let
alone
a
large
colony
or
a
permanent
human
residence
that
what
all
the
reports
conclusively
demonstrate
every
bit
of
oxygen
every
bit
of
food
and
clothing
and
material
would
have
to
be
supplied
and
investigations
prove
there
no
chance
of
ever
realizing
any
return
the
cost
of
such
an
operation
is
staggeringly
prohibitive
even
if
there
was
evidence
to
show
it
might
be
possible
to
undertake
some
mining
projects
it
would
begin
to
defray
expenses
once
you
consider
the
transportation
factor
but
if
they
improve
the
rockets
manage
to
make
room
for
a
bigger
payload
would
it
be
cheaper
it
would
still
cost
roughly
a
billion
dollars
to
equip
a
flight
and
maintain
a
personnel
of
twenty
men
for
a
year
the
president
told
him
i
checked
into
that
and
even
this
estimate
is
based
on
the
most
optimistic
projection
so
you
can
see
there
no
use
in
continuing
now
we
never
solve
our
problems
by
attempting
to
colonize
the
moon
or
mars
but
it
the
only
possible
solution
left
to
us
no
it
is
the
president
said
there
always
our
friend
leffingwell
the
secretary
of
state
turned
away
you
ca
officially
sponsor
a
thing
like
that
he
muttered
it
political
suicide
the
gray
smile
returned
to
the
gray
lips
suicide
what
do
you
know
about
suicide
art
i
been
reading
a
few
statistics
on
too
how
many
actual
suicides
do
you
think
we
had
in
this
country
last
year
a
hundred
thousand
two
hundred
maybe
two
million
the
president
leaned
forward
add
to
that
over
a
million
murders
and
six
million
crimes
of
violence
i
never
knew
damned
right
you
did
we
used
to
have
a
federal
bureau
of
investigation
to
help
prevent
such
things
now
the
big
job
is
merely
to
hush
them
up
we
doing
everything
in
our
power
just
to
keep
these
matters
quiet
or
else
there
be
utter
panic
then
there
the
accident
total
and
the
psycho
rate
we
ca
build
institutions
fast
enough
to
hold
the
mental
cases
nor
train
doctors
enough
to
care
for
them
shifting
them
into
other
jobs
in
other
areas
does
cure
and
it
no
longer
even
disguises
what
is
happening
at
this
rate
another
ten
years
will
see
half
the
nation
going
insane
and
it
like
this
all
over
the
world
this
is
art
through
sheer
fecundity
leffingwell
is
right
the
reproductive
instinct
unchecked
will
overbalance
group
survival
in
the
end
how
long
has
it
been
since
you
were
out
on
the
streets
the
secretary
of
state
shrugged
you
know
i
never
go
out
on
the
streets
he
said
it
is
very
safe
of
course
not
but
it
no
safer
for
the
hundreds
of
millions
who
have
to
go
out
every
day
accident
crime
the
sheer
maddening
proximity
of
the
crowds
these
phenomena
are
increasing
through
mathematical
progression
and
they
must
be
stopped
leffingwell
has
the
only
answer
they
wo
buy
it
warned
the
secretary
congress
wo
and
the
voters
wo
any
more
than
they
bought
and
this
is
worse
i
know
that
too
the
president
rose
and
walked
over
to
the
window
looking
out
at
the
apartments
which
loomed
across
what
had
once
been
the
mall
he
was
trying
to
find
the
dwarfed
spire
of
washington
monument
in
the
tangled
maze
of
stone
if
i
go
before
the
people
and
sponsor
leffingwell
i
through
through
as
president
through
with
the
party
they
crucify
me
but
somebody
in
authority
must
push
this
project
that
the
beginning
once
it
known
people
will
have
to
think
about
the
possibilities
there
be
opposition
then
controversy
then
debate
and
gradually
leffingwell
will
gain
adherents
it
may
take
five
years
it
may
take
ten
finally
the
change
will
come
first
through
volunteers
then
by
law
i
only
pray
that
it
happens
soon
they
curse
your
name
the
secretary
said
they
try
to
kill
you
it
going
to
be
hell
hell
for
me
if
i
do
yes
worse
hell
for
the
whole
world
if
i
do
but
are
you
quite
sure
it
will
work
his
method
i
mean
you
saw
the
reports
on
his
tests
did
you
it
works
all
right
we
got
more
than
just
abstract
data
now
we
got
films
for
the
telescreenings
all
set
up
films
you
mean
you
actually
what
the
results
are
why
just
telling
the
people
will
be
bad
enough
and
admitting
the
government
sponsored
the
project
under
wraps
but
when
they
nothing
on
earth
can
save
you
from
assassination
perhaps
it
does
really
matter
the
president
crushed
his
cigarette
in
the
ashtray
one
less
mouth
to
feed
and
i
getting
pretty
sick
of
synthetic
meals
anyway
president
winthrop
turned
to
the
secretary
his
eyes
brightening
momentarily
tell
you
what
art
i
not
planning
on
breaking
the
proposal
to
the
public
until
next
monday
what
say
we
have
a
little
private
dinner
party
on
saturday
evening
just
the
cabinet
members
and
their
wives
sort
of
a
farewell
celebration
in
a
way
but
we
call
it
that
of
course
chef
tells
me
there
still
twenty
pounds
of
hamburger
in
the
freezers
twenty
pounds
of
hamburger
you
mean
it
the
secretary
of
state
was
smiling
too
that
right
the
president
of
the
united
states
grinned
in
anticipation
been
a
long
time
since
i
tasted
a
real
hamburger
harry
collins
harry
did
ask
any
questions
he
just
kept
his
mouth
shut
and
waited
maybe
manschoff
suspected
and
maybe
he
did
anyway
there
was
no
trouble
harry
figured
there
would
be
as
long
as
he
stayed
in
line
and
went
through
the
proper
motions
it
was
all
a
matter
of
pretending
to
conform
pretending
to
agree
pretending
to
believe
so
he
watched
his
step
in
the
dreams
and
then
he
was
always
falling
into
the
yawning
he
kept
his
nose
clean
in
the
dreams
he
smelled
the
blood
and
brimstone
of
the
he
managed
to
retain
a
cheerful
smile
at
all
times
in
the
dreams
he
eventually
he
even
met
myrna
she
was
the
pretty
little
brunette
whom
ritchie
had
mentioned
and
she
did
her
best
to
console
him
in
dreams
when
he
embraced
her
he
was
embracing
a
writhing
coil
of
slimy
it
may
have
been
that
harry
collins
went
a
little
mad
just
having
to
pretend
that
he
was
sane
but
he
learned
the
way
and
he
managed
he
saved
the
madness
was
it
the
reality
for
the
dreams
meanwhile
he
waited
and
said
nothing
he
said
nothing
when
after
three
months
or
so
myrna
was
suddenly
transferred
without
warning
he
said
nothing
when
once
a
week
or
so
he
went
in
to
visit
with
manschoff
he
said
nothing
when
manschoff
volunteered
the
information
that
ritchie
had
been
transferred
too
or
suggested
that
it
would
be
best
to
stay
on
for
further
therapy
and
he
said
nothing
when
still
a
third
nurse
came
his
way
a
woman
who
was
callid
complaisant
and
nauseatingly
nymphomaniac
the
important
thing
was
to
stay
alive
stay
alive
and
try
to
learn
it
took
him
almost
an
additional
year
to
find
out
what
he
wanted
to
find
out
more
than
eight
months
passed
before
he
found
a
way
of
sneaking
out
of
his
room
at
night
and
a
way
of
getting
into
that
third
unit
through
a
delivery
door
which
was
occasionally
left
open
through
negligence
even
then
all
he
learned
was
that
the
female
patients
did
have
their
living
quarters
here
along
with
the
members
of
the
staff
and
presumably
leffingwell
many
of
the
women
patients
rather
than
nurses
as
claimed
and
a
good
number
of
them
were
in
various
stages
of
pregnancy
but
this
proved
nothing
several
times
harry
debated
the
possibilities
of
taking
some
of
the
other
men
in
his
unit
into
his
confidence
then
he
remembered
what
had
happened
to
arnold
ritchie
and
decided
against
this
course
the
risk
was
too
great
he
had
to
continue
alone
it
was
until
harry
managed
to
get
into
unit
four
that
he
got
what
he
wanted
what
he
want
and
learned
that
reality
and
dreams
were
one
and
the
same
there
was
the
night
more
than
a
year
after
he
come
to
the
treatment
center
when
he
finally
broke
into
the
basement
and
found
the
incinerators
and
the
incinerators
led
to
the
operating
and
delivery
chambers
and
the
delivery
chambers
led
to
the
laboratory
and
the
laboratory
led
to
the
incubators
and
the
incubators
led
to
the
nightmare
in
the
nightmare
harry
found
himself
looking
down
at
the
mistakes
and
the
failures
and
he
recognized
them
for
what
they
were
and
he
knew
then
why
the
incinerators
were
kept
busy
and
why
the
black
smoke
poured
in
the
nightmare
he
saw
the
special
units
containing
those
which
were
not
mistakes
or
failures
and
in
a
way
they
were
worse
than
the
others
they
were
red
and
wriggling
there
beneath
the
glass
and
on
the
glass
surfaces
hung
the
charts
which
gave
the
data
then
harry
saw
the
names
saw
his
own
name
repeated
twice
once
for
sue
once
for
myrna
and
he
realized
that
he
had
contributed
to
the
successful
outcome
or
issue
of
the
experiments
issue
these
horrors
and
that
was
why
manschoff
must
have
chosen
to
take
the
risk
of
keeping
him
alive
because
he
was
one
of
the
guinea
pigs
and
he
had
spawned
spawned
living
mewing
abominations
he
had
dreamed
of
these
things
and
now
he
saw
that
they
were
real
so
that
nightmare
merged
with
and
he
could
gaze
down
at
it
with
open
eyes
and
scream
at
last
with
open
mouth
then
of
course
an
attendant
came
running
he
seemed
to
be
moving
ever
so
slowly
because
everything
moves
so
slowly
in
a
and
harry
saw
him
coming
and
lifted
a
and
smashed
it
down
over
the
man
head
ever
so
and
then
he
heard
the
others
coming
and
he
climbed
out
of
the
window
and
ran
the
searchlights
winked
across
the
courtyards
and
the
sirens
vomited
hysteria
from
metallic
throats
and
the
night
was
filled
with
shadows
that
pursued
but
harry
knew
where
to
run
he
ran
straight
through
the
nightmare
through
all
the
fantastic
but
familiar
convolutions
of
sight
and
sound
and
then
he
came
to
the
river
and
plunged
in
now
the
nightmare
was
not
sight
or
sound
but
merely
sensation
icy
cold
and
distilled
darkness
ripples
that
ran
then
raced
and
roiled
and
roared
but
there
had
to
be
a
way
out
of
the
nightmare
and
there
had
to
be
a
way
out
of
the
canyon
and
that
way
was
the
river
apparently
no
one
else
had
thought
of
the
river
perhaps
they
had
considered
it
as
a
possible
avenue
of
escape
and
then
discarded
the
notion
when
they
realized
how
it
ripped
and
raged
among
the
rocks
as
it
finally
plunged
from
the
canyon
mouth
obviously
no
one
could
hope
to
combat
that
current
and
survive
but
strange
things
happen
in
nightmares
and
you
fight
the
numbness
and
the
blackness
and
you
claw
and
convulse
and
you
twist
and
turn
and
toss
and
then
you
ride
the
crests
of
frenzy
and
plunge
into
the
troughs
of
panic
and
despair
and
you
sweep
round
and
round
and
sink
down
into
nothingness
until
you
break
through
to
the
freedom
which
comes
only
with
oblivion
somewhere
beyond
the
canyon
moiling
maw
harry
collins
found
that
freedom
and
that
oblivion
he
escaped
from
the
nightmare
just
as
he
escaped
from
the
river
the
river
itself
roared
on
without
him
and
the
nightmare
continued
too
minnie
schultz
when
frank
came
home
minnie
met
him
at
the
door
she
did
say
a
word
just
handed
him
the
envelope
containing
the
notice
what
the
matter
frank
asked
trying
to
take
her
in
his
arms
you

crying
never
mind
minnie
freed
herself
just
read
what
it
says
there
frank
read
slowly
determinedly
his
features
contorted
in
concentration
vocational
apt
had
terminated
his
schooling
at
the
old
level
and
while
like
all
students
he
had
been
taught
enough
so
that
he
could
read
the
necessary
advertising
commercials
any
printed
message
of
this
sort
provided
a
definite
challenge
halfway
through
the
notice
he
started
to
scowl
what
kind
of
monkey
business
is
this
no
monkey
business
it
the
new
law
everybody
that
gets
married
in
angelisco

ag
culture
project

frank
was
leaning
against
the
sink
listening
now
he
took
three
steps
forward
and
sat
down
on
the
bed
he
did
look
at
her
as
he
spoke
well
we
got
ta
do
something
he
said

minnie
took
a
deep
breath
then
she
sat
down
and
put
her
arm
around
frank
but
you
wanted
kids
she
murmured

minnie
put
her
arm
around
frank
again
and
made
him
look
at
her
that
not
true
she
told
him
that
just
a
lot
of
naturalist
talk
i
know
hell

but
i

honey

like

when

and
she
all
right
you

her
baby

frank
said

and
all

place
of
our

at
all
and
they
make
it
easier
carrying
the
baby
they

a
chance
for
a
bigger
place
we
go
right
on
the
housing
lists

frank

at
her
is
that

real
bedroom
but
honey

about
the
kid
he
muttered
how
you
suppose
it
gon
na
feel
how
you
like
to
grow

and
grow
up
how
you
like
to
be
a
midget
three
feet
high
in
a
world
where
everybody
else
is
bigger
what
kind
of
a
life
you
call
i
want
my
son
to
have
a
decent
chance
he
will
have
minnie
stared
back
at
him
but
she
was
seeing
his
face
do
you
understand
honey
this
is
just
something
happening
to
not
special
it
happening
to
everybody
all
over
the
country
all
over
the
world
you
seen
it
in
the
have
you
most
states
they
adopted
the
laws
and
in
a
couple
more
years
it
be
the
only
way
anyone
will
ever
have
kids
ten
twenty
years
from
now
the
kids
will
be
growing
up
ours
wo
be
different
then
because
from
now
on
all
the
kids
will
be
just
like
he
is
the
same
size
i
thought
you
was
afraid
of
the
shots
frank
said
minnie
was
still
staring
i
was
honey
only
i
dunno
i
keep
thinking
about
grandma
what
the
old
lady
got
to
do
with
it
well
i
remember
when
i
was
a
little
girl
like
how
my
grandma
always
used
to
tell
me
about
grandma
when
was
a
little
girl
she
was
saying
about
how
in
the
old
days
before
there
even
was
an
angelisco
when
her
grandma
came
out
here
in
a
covered
wagon
just
think
honey
she
was
younger
than
i
am
and
she
come
thousands
and
thousands
of
miles
in
a
wagon
with
real
horses
like
was
any
houses
no
people
or
nothing
except
indians
that
shot
at
them
and
they
climbed
up
the
mountains
and
they
crossed
over
the
deserts
and
went
hungry
and
thirsty
and
had
fights
with
those
indians
all
the
way
but
they
never
stopped
until
they
got
here
because
they
was
the
pioneers
pioneers
that
what
grandma
said
grandma
called
herself
a
pioneer
she
was
real
proud
of
it
too
because
it
means
having
the
courage
to
cut
loose
from
all
the
old
things
and
try
something
new
when
you
need
to
start
a
whole
new
world
a
whole
new
kind
of
life
she
sighed
i
always
wanted
to
be
a
pioneer
like
but
i
never
thought
i
get
the
chance
what
are
you
talking
about
what
all
this
got
to
do
with
us
or
having
a
kid
do
you
see
taking
these
shots
having
a
baby
this
new
way
sort
of
being
a
pioneer
too
gon
na
help
bring
a
new
kind
of
people
into
a
new
kind
of
world
and
if
that
not
being
a
pioneer
like
it
the
closest
i
can
come
to
it
it
sounds
right
to
me
now
minnie
smiled
and
nodded
i
guess
i
made
up
my
mind
just
now
taking
the
shots
hell
you
are
frank
told
her
we
talk
about
it
some
more
in
the
morning
but
minnie
continued
to
smile
and
that
night
as
she
lay
in
the
utility
bed
the
squeaking
of
the
springs
became
the
sound
of
turning
wheels
the
plastic
walls
and
ceiling
of
the
apartment
turned
to
billowing
canvas
and
the
thunder
of
the
passing
jets
transformed
itself
into
the
drumming
hoofbeats
of
a
million
buffalo
frank
talk
to
her
again
in
the
morning
if
he
minnie
thought
would
make
any
difference
now
because
you
ca
stop
us
harry
collins
harry
crouched
behind
the
boulders
propping
the
rifle
up
between
the
rocks
and
adjusted
the
telescopic
sights
the
distant
doorway
sprang
into
sharp
focus
grunting
with
satisfaction
he
settled
down
to
his
vigil
the
had
been
dulled
down
against
detection
by
reflection
and
harry
dark
glasses
protected
him
against
the
glare
of
the
morning
sun
he
might
have
to
wait
several
hours
now
but
he
did
care
it
had
taken
him
twelve
years
to
come
this
far
and
he
was
willing
to
wait
a
little
while
longer
was
it
really
that
long
a
mirror
might
have
answered
him
a
mirror
might
have
shown
him
the
harsh
features
of
a
man
of
but
harry
needed
no
mirror
he
could
remember
the
past
dozen
years
only
too
easily
though
they
had
not
been
easy
years
surviving
the
river
was
only
the
beginning
animal
strength
carried
him
through
that
ordeal
but
he
emerged
from
the
river
as
an
animal
a
wounded
animal
crawling
through
the
brush
and
arroyo
outside
the
southern
colorado
canyon
and
it
was
animal
cunning
which
preserved
him
he
wandered
several
days
until
he
encountered
emil
grizek
and
his
outfit
by
that
time
he
was
and
completely
delirious
it
took
a
month
until
he
was
up
and
around
again
but
emil
and
the
boys
had
nursed
him
through
they
took
turns
caring
for
him
in
the
bunkhouse
their
methods
were
crude
but
efficient
and
harry
was
grateful
best
of
all
they
asked
no
questions
status
was
that
of
a
hunted
fugitive
without
a
vocational
apt
record
or
rating
the
authorities
or
any
prospective
employers
would
inquire
into
these
things
but
emil
grizek
never
seemed
curious
by
the
time
harry
was
up
and
around
again
he
been
accepted
as
one
of
the
bunch
he
told
them
his
name
was
harry
sanders
and
that
was
enough
two
months
after
they
found
him
he
signed
on
with
emil
grizek
and
found
a
new
role
in
life
harry
collins
advertising
copywriter
had
become
harry
sanders
working
cowhand
there
was
surprisingly
little
difficulty
grizek
had
absentee
employers
who
were
interested
in
their
foreman
methods
just
as
long
as
he
recruited
his
own
wranglers
for
the
bar
b
ranch
nobody
demanded
to
see
apt
cards
or
insisted
on
making
out
formal
and
the
pay
was
in
cash
cowhands
were
hard
to
come
by
these
days
and
it
was
an
unspoken
premise
that
the
men
taking
on
such
jobs
would
be
vagrants
migratory
workers
fugitives
from
justice
and
injustice
a
generation
or
so
ago
they
might
have
become
tramps
but
the
last
of
the
hoboes
had
vanished
along
with
the
last
of
the
freight
trains
once
the
derelicts
haunted
the
canyons
of
the
big
cities
today
there
was
no
place
for
them
there
so
they
fled
to
the
canyons
of
the
west
harry
had
found
himself
a
new
niche
and
no
questions
asked
oddly
enough
he
fitted
in
the
outdoor
life
agreed
with
him
and
in
a
matter
of
months
he
was
a
passable
cowpoke
within
a
year
he
was
one
of
grizek
top
hands
he
learned
to
ride
a
bucking
jeep
with
the
best
of
them
and
he
could
spot
single
out
and
stun
a
steer
in
forty
seconds
flat
then
use
his
electronic
brander
on
it
and
have
the
critter
back
on
its
feet
in
just
under
a
minute
work
was
no
problem
and
neither
was
recreation
the
bunkhouse
offered
crude
but
adequate
facilities
for
living
and
an
antique
broiler
seemed
good
enough
for
roughing
it
and
cookie
at
least
turned
out
real
meals
eating
genuine
beef
and
baked
bread
was
a
treat
and
so
was
having
the
luxury
of
all
that
space
in
the
sleeping
quarters
harry
thrived
on
it
and
some
of
the
other
hands
were
interesting
companions
true
they
were
renegades
and
mavericks
but
they
were
each
of
them
unique
and
individual
and
harry
enjoyed
listening
to
them
fan
the
breeze
during
the
long
nights
there
was
big
phil
who
was
pushing
sixty
now
but
you
never
know
it
not
unless
you
got
him
to
talking
about
the
old
days
when
been
a
boy
in
detroit
his
daddy
had
been
one
of
the
last
of
the
union
men
back
in
the
days
of
what
they
used
to
call
the
organized
labor
movement
he
could
tell
you
about
agreements
and
the
railroad
brotherhood
and
contract
negotiations
almost
as
if
he
knew
of
these
things
through
personal
experience
he
even
remembered
the
democratic
party
phil
got
out
when
the
government
took
over
and
set
up
vocational
apt
and
industrial
supervision
that
when
he
drifted
west
tom
lowery
family
had
been
military
he
claimed
to
have
been
a
member
of
the
last
graduating
class
ever
to
leave
west
point
when
the
armament
race
ended
his
prospects
of
a
career
vanished
and
he
settled
down
as
a
guard
at
canaveral
finally
he
headed
for
the
open
country
bassett
was
the
scholar
of
the
outfit
he
could
sit
around
and
quote
by
the
hour
classic
writers
like
prather
and
spillane
in
another
age
he
might
have
been
a
college
professor
or
even
a
football
coach
he
had
an
aptitude
for
the
arts
and
there
was
lobo
the
misogynist
who
had
fled
a
wife
and
eleven
children
back
in
monterey
and
januzki
who
used
to
be
mixed
up
with
one
of
those
odd
religious
cults
out
on
the
coast
he
bragged
been
one
of
the
big
in
the
beat
generationists
and
he
argued
with
bassett
about
some
evangelist
named
kerouac
best
of
all
though
harry
liked
talking
to
nick
kendrick
hobby
was
music
and
he
treasured
his
stereophonic
unit
and
collection
of
tapes
he
too
was
a
classicist
in
his
way
and
there
was
many
a
long
winter
night
when
harry
sat
there
listening
to
ancient
folk
songs
the
quaint
atonalities
of
progressive
jazz
and
the
childishly
frantic
rhythms
of
cool
sounds
were
somehow
soothing
and
reassuring
in
their
reminder
of
a
simple
heritage
from
a
simpler
age
but
above
all
these
men
were
wranglers
and
they
took
a
peculiar
pride
in
the
traditions
of
their
own
calling
there
was
a
one
of
them
who
would
spend
hours
mulling
over
the
lore
of
the
range
and
the
prairie
they
knew
the
great
names
from
the
great
days
eugene
autry
wyatt
earp
the
legendary
thomas
mix
dale
robertson
paladin
and
all
the
others
men
who
rode
actual
horses
in
the
era
when
the
west
was
really
an
untamed
frontier
and
like
the
cowboys
they
were
they
maintained
the
customs
of
other
days
every
few
months
they
rode
a
bucking
helicopter
into
some
raw
western
town
las
vegas
or
reno
or
even
over
to
palm
springs
to
drink
recklessly
in
the
cocktail
lounges
gamble
wildly
at
the
slots
or
go
down
the
line
with
some
telescreen
model
on
location
for
outdoor
there
were
still
half
a
dozen
such
scattered
throughout
the
west
even
the
government
acknowledged
the
need
of
lonely
men
to
blow
off
steam
and
though
ag
culture
officially
disapproved
of
the
whole
cowhand
system
and
talked
grimly
of
setting
up
new
and
more
efficient
methods
for
training
personnel
and
handling
the
cattle
ranges
nothing
was
ever
done
perhaps
the
authorities
knew
that
it
was
a
hopeless
task
only
the
outcasts
and
iconoclasts
had
the
temperament
necessary
to
survive
such
loneliness
under
an
open
sky
conformists
just
could
not
endure
the
monotony
but
even
emil
grizek
hands
marvelled
at
the
way
harry
lived
he
never
joined
them
in
their
disorderly
descent
upon
the
scarlet
cities
of
the
plain
and
most
of
the
time
he
did
even
seem
to
watch
the
telescreen
if
anything
he
deliberately
avoided
all
possible
contact
with
civilization
since
he
never
volunteered
any
information
about
his
own
past
they
privately
concluded
that
he
was
just
a
psychopathic
personality
strong
regressive
and
seclusive
tendencies
bassett
explained
solemnly
sure
nick
kendrick
nodded
wisely
you
mean
a
mouldy
fig
like
creeping
meatball
muttered
cultist
januzki
not
being
religious
fanatics
the
others
did
understand
the
reference
but
gradually
they
came
to
accept
harry
isolationist
ways
as
the
norm
at
least
for
him
and
since
he
never
quarreled
never
exhibited
any
signs
of
dissatisfaction
he
was
left
to
his
own
pattern
thus
it
was
all
the
more
surprising
when
that
pattern
was
rudely
and
abruptly
shattered
harry
remembered
the
occasion
well
it
was
the
day
the
leff
law
was
officially
upheld
by
the
supremist
courts
the
whole
business
came
over
the
telescreens
and
there
was
no
way
of
avoiding
it
you
avoid
it
because
everybody
was
talking
about
it
and
everybody
was
watching
now
what
do
you
think
emil
grizek
demanded
any
woman
wants
a
baby
she
got
to
have
those
shots
they
say
kids
shrink
down
into
nothing
weigh
less
than
two
pounds
when
they
born
and
never
grow
up
to
be
any
bigger
than
midgets
you
ask
me
the
whole
thing
plumb
loco
to
say
nothing
of
psychotic
i
dunno
this
from
big
phil
reckon
they
just
about
have
to
do
something
the
way
cities
are
filling
up
and
all
tell
me
every
spot
in
the
country
except
for
the
plains
states
here
is
busting
at
the
seams
same
in
europe
africa
south
america
running
out
of
space
running
out
of
food
all
over
the
world
this
man
leffingwell
figures
on
cutting
down
on
size
so
to
keep
the
whole
shebang
going
but
why
could
it
be
done
on
a
voluntary
basis
bassett
demanded
these
arbitrary
rulings
are
bound
to
result
in
frustrations
and
can
you
imagine
what
will
happen
to
the
individual
family
constellations
take
a
couple
that
already
has
two
youngsters
as
of
now
suppose
the
wife
submits
to
the
inoculations
for
her
next
child
and
it
born
with
a
how
in
the
world
will
that
child
survive
as
a
midget
in
a
family
of
giants
there
be
untold
damage
to
the
personality
we
heard
all
those
arguments
tom
lowery
cut
in
the
naturalists
have
been
handing
out
that
line
for
years
what
happens
to
the
new
generation
of
kids
how
do
we
know
they
wo
be
mentally
defective
how
can
they
adjust
by
what
right
does
the
government
interfere
with
private
lives
personal
religious
beliefs
all
that
sort
of
thing
for
over
ten
years
now
the
debate
been
going
on
and
meanwhile
time
is
running
out
space
is
running
out
food
is
running
out
it
is
a
question
of
individual
choice
any
longer
it
a
question
of
group
survival
i
say
the
courts
are
right
we
have
to
go
according
to
law
and
back
the
law
up
with
force
of
arms
if
necessary
we
get
the
message
januzki
agreed
but
something
tells
me
be
trouble
most
folks
need
a
midget
like
they
need
a
monkey
on
their
backs
it
a
gasser
pardners
said
nick
kendrick
naturalists
do
dig
this
they
fight
it
all
along
the
line
everybody
gon
na
be
all
shook
up
it
is
still
a
good
idea
lobo
insisted
this
leffingwell
he
has
made
the
tests
for
years
he
has
given
injections
and
no
harm
has
come
the
children
are
healthy
they
survive
they
learn
in
special
schools
how
do
you
know
bassett
demanded
maybe
it
all
a
lot
of
motivationalist
propaganda
we
have
seen
them
on
the
telescreens
no
they
could
be
faking
the
whole
thing
but
leffingwell
he
has
offered
the
shots
to
other
governments
beside
our
own
the
whole
world
will
adopt
them
what
if
some
countries
do
what
if
our
kids
become
midgets
and
the
asiatics
refuse
the
inoculations
they
wo
they
need
room
even
more
than
we
do
no
sense
arguing
emil
grizek
concluded
it
the
law
you
know
that
and
if
you
do
like
it
join
the
naturalists
he
chuckled
but
better
hurry
something
tells
me
there
wo
be
any
naturalists
around
after
a
couple
of
years
now
that
there
a
leff
law
the
government
is
likely
to
stand
for
too
much
criticism
he
turned
to
harry
what
do
you
think
he
asked
harry
shrugged
no
comment
he
said
but
the
next
day
he
went
to
grizek
and
demanded
his
pay
in
full
leaving
grizek
muttered
i
do
understand
you
been
with
us
almost
five
years
where
you
going
what
you
intend
to
do
what
got
into
you
all
of
a
sudden
time
for
a
change
harry
told
him
i
been
saving
my
money
do
i
know
it
never
touched
a
penny
in
all
this
time
grizek
ran
a
hand
across
his
chin
say
if
it
a
raise
you
looking
for
i
can
no
thanks
it
not
that
i
money
enough
so
you
have
around
eighteen
twenty
thousand
i
reckon
what
with
the
bonuses
emil
grizek
sighed
well
if
you
insist
that
the
way
it
got
to
be
i
suppose
when
you
plan
on
taking
off
just
as
soon
as
there
a
available
got
one
going
up
to
colorado
springs
tomorrow
morning
for
the
mail
i
can
get
you
aboard
give
you
a
check
i
want
my
money
in
cash
well
now
that
is
so
easy
have
to
send
up
for
a
special
draft
take
a
week
or
so
i
can
wait
all
right
and
think
it
over
maybe
you
decide
to
change
your
mind
but
harry
did
change
his
mind
and
ten
days
later
he
rode
a
into
town
his
strapped
beneath
his
from
colorado
springs
he
jetted
to
kancity
and
from
kancity
to
memphisee
as
long
as
he
had
money
nobody
asked
any
questions
he
holed
up
in
cheap
airtels
and
waited
for
developments
it
was
easy
to
accustom
himself
to
urbanization
again
he
had
been
away
from
cities
for
over
seven
years
now
and
it
might
well
have
been
seven
centuries
the
overpopulation
problem
was
appalling
the
outlawing
of
private
automotive
vehicles
had
helped
and
the
clearing
of
the
airlanes
served
a
purpose
the
widespread
increase
in
the
use
of
atomic
power
cut
the
smog
somewhat
but
the
synthetic
food
was
frightful
the
crowding
intolerable
and
the
welter
of
rules
and
regulations
attending
the
performance
of
even
the
simplest
human
activity
past
all
his
comprehension
ration
cards
were
in
universal
use
for
almost
everything
fortunately
for
harry
the
black
market
accepted
cash
with
no
embarrassing
inquiries
he
found
that
he
could
survive
but
harry
interest
was
not
in
survival
he
was
bent
upon
destruction
surely
the
naturalists
would
be
organized
and
planning
a
way
back
in
of
course
they
been
merely
an
articulate
minority
without
formal
unity
an
abstract
amorphous
group
akin
to
the
liberals
of
previous
generations
a
naturalist
could
be
a
catholic
priest
a
unitarian
layman
an
atheist
factory
hand
a
government
employee
a
housewife
with
strong
prejudices
against
governmental
controls
a
wealthy
man
who
deplored
the
dangers
of
growing
industrialization
an
ag
culture
worker
who
dreaded
the
dwindling
of
individual
rights
an
educator
who
feared
widespread
employment
of
social
psychology
or
almost
anyone
who
opposed
the
concept
of
mass
man
naturalists
had
never
formed
a
single
class
a
single
political
party
surely
however
the
enactment
of
the
leffingwell
law
would
have
united
them
harry
knew
there
was
strong
opposition
not
only
on
the
higher
levels
but
amongst
the
general
population
people
would
be
afraid
of
the
inoculations
theologians
would
condemn
the
process
economic
interests
owners
and
transportation
magnates
and
manufacturers
would
sense
the
threat
here
they
sponsor
and
subsidize
their
spokesmen
and
the
naturalists
would
evolve
into
an
efficient
body
of
opposition
so
harry
hoped
and
so
he
thought
until
he
came
out
into
the
cities
came
out
into
the
cities
and
realized
that
the
very
magnitude
of
mass
man
mitigated
against
any
attempt
to
organize
him
except
as
a
creature
who
labored
and
consumed
organization
springs
from
discussion
and
discussion
from
thought
but
who
can
think
in
chaos
discuss
in
delirium
organize
in
a
vacuum
and
the
common
citizen
harry
realized
had
seemingly
lost
the
capacity
for
group
action
he
remembered
his
own
existence
years
ago
either
he
was
lost
in
a
crowd
or
he
was
alone
at
home
firm
friendships
were
rare
and
family
units
survived
on
the
flimsiest
of
foundations
it
took
too
much
time
and
effort
just
to
follow
the
rules
follow
the
traffic
follow
the
incessant
routines
governing
even
the
simplest
in
the
teeming
cities
for
leisure
there
was
the
telescreen
and
the
yellowjackets
and
serious
problems
could
be
referred
to
the
psych
in
routine
everybody
seemed
lost
in
the
crowd
these
days
harry
discovered
that
manschoff
had
indeed
lied
to
him
mental
disorders
were
on
the
increase
he
remembered
an
old
old
book
one
of
the
very
first
treatises
on
sociological
psychology
lonely
was
it
full
of
about
and
personalities
well
there
was
a
grain
of
truth
in
it
all
the
crowd
and
its
individual
members
lived
in
loneliness
and
since
you
did
know
very
many
people
well
enough
to
talk
to
intimately
you
talked
to
yourself
since
you
could
get
away
from
physical
contact
with
others
whenever
you
ventured
abroad
you
stayed
inside
except
when
you
had
to
go
to
work
had
to
line
up
for
or
supplies
had
to
wait
for
hours
for
your
on
and
staying
inside
meant
being
confined
to
the
equivalent
of
an
prison
cell
if
you
were
married
you
lived
in
solitary
if
you
were
married
you
suffered
the
presence
of
whose
habits
became
intolerable
in
time
so
you
watched
the
screen
more
and
more
or
you
increased
your
quota
of
sedation
and
when
that
did
help
you
looked
for
a
real
escape
it
was
always
available
to
you
if
you
searched
long
enough
waiting
at
the
tip
of
a
knife
in
the
coil
of
a
rope
the
muzzle
of
a
gun
you
could
find
it
at
the
very
bottom
of
a
bottle
of
pills
or
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
courtyard
outside
your
window
harry
recalled
looking
for
it
there
himself
so
many
years
ago
but
now
he
was
looking
for
something
else
he
was
looking
for
others
who
shared
not
only
his
viewpoint
but
his
purposefulness
where
were
the
naturalists
harry
searched
for
several
years
press
but
there
were
no
naturalists
visible
on
the
telescreens
the
news
and
the
newsmakers
reflected
a
national
philosophy
adopted
many
generations
ago
by
the
founding
fathers
of
in
their
infinite
wisdom
good
for
general
motors
is
good
for
the
and
according
to
them
everything
happening
was
good
for
the
country
that
was
the
cardinal
precept
in
the
science
of
autobuyology
there
were
no
arnold
ritchies
left
any
more
and
the
printed
newzine
seemed
to
have
vanished
clergy
individual
churches
with
congregations
in
physical
attendance
seemed
difficult
to
find
telepreachers
still
appeared
regularly
every
sunday
but
their
scripts
like
everyone
else
had
been
processed
in
advance
denominationalism
and
sectarianism
had
waned
too
all
of
these
performers
seemed
very
much
alike
in
that
they
were
vigorous
forthright
inspiring
champions
of
the
scientists
but
the
scientists
were
a
part
of
the
government
and
the
government
was
a
system
and
the
system
supported
the
nation
and
the
nation
supported
the
scientists
of
course
there
were
still
private
laboratories
subsidized
for
industrial
purposes
but
the
men
who
worked
in
them
seemed
singularly
disinterested
in
social
problems
in
a
way
harry
could
understand
their
position
it
is
likely
that
a
dedicated
scientist
a
man
whose
specialized
research
has
won
him
a
nobel
prize
for
creating
a
new
detergent
will
be
worldly
enough
to
face
unpleasant
realities
beyond
the
walls
of
his
antiseptic
sanctum
after
all
there
was
precedent
for
such
isolationism
did
the
sainted
betty
crocker
ever
enlist
in
any
crusades
as
for
physicians
psychiatrists
and
they
were
the
very
ones
who
formed
the
hard
core
of
leffingwell
support
educators
then
vocational
apt
was
a
part
of
the
government
and
the
poor
pedagogues
who
had
spent
generations
hacking
their
way
out
of
the
blackboard
jungles
were
only
too
happy
to
welcome
the
notion
of
a
coming
millennium
when
their
small
charges
would
be
still
smaller
even
though
formal
schooling
for
most
youngsters
terminated
at
fourteen
there
was
still
the
problem
of
overcrowding
telescreening
and
teletesting
techniques
were
a
help
but
the
problem
was
essentially
a
physical
one
and
leffingwell
was
providing
a
physical
solution
besides
the
educators
had
been
themselves
educated
through
vocational
apt
and
while
they
and
the
government
fervently
upheld
the
principle
of
freedom
of
speech
they
had
to
draw
the
line
somewhere
as
everyone
knows
freedom
of
speech
does
not
mean
freedom
to
men
perhaps
there
were
some
disgruntled
souls
in
the
commercial
community
whose
secret
heroes
were
the
oil
tycoons
of
a
bygone
era
or
the
stock
exchange
clan
united
under
the
totems
of
the
bull
or
the
bear
but
the
day
of
the
rugged
individualist
was
long
departed
only
the
flabby
individualist
remained
and
he
had
the
forms
to
fill
out
and
the
inspectors
to
contend
with
and
the
rationing
to
worry
about
and
the
taxes
to
meet
and
the
quotas
to
fulfill
but
in
the
long
run
he
managed
the
business
man
worked
for
the
government
but
the
government
also
worked
for
him
his
position
was
protected
and
if
the
government
said
the
leff
shots
would
solve
the
overpopulation
problem
cutting
down
the
number
of
consumers
well
was
that
really
so
bad
why
in
a
generation
or
so
there
be
even
customers
that
meant
increased
property
values
too
it
took
harry
several
years
to
realize
he
never
find
naturalists
organized
for
group
action
the
capacity
for
group
action
had
vanished
as
the
size
of
the
group
increased
all
interests
were
interdependent
the
old
civic
fraternal
social
and
societies
had
no
present
purpose
any
more
and
the
whether
they
represented
idealistic
humanitarianism
or
crass
had
vanished
in
the
crowd
patriotism
racialism
unionism
had
all
been
lost
in
a
moiling
megalopolitanism
there
were
protests
of
course
the
mothers
objected
some
of
them
ag
culture
in
particular
ran
into
difficulties
with
women
who
revived
the
quaint
custom
of
going
on
strike
against
the
leff
law
and
refused
to
take
their
shots
but
it
was
all
on
the
individual
level
and
quickly
coped
with
government
medical
authorities
met
the
women
at
checkup
time
and
demonstrated
that
the
leff
law
had
teeth
in
it
teeth
and
scalpels
the
rebellious
women
were
not
subdued
slain
or
segregated
they
were
merely
sterilized
perhaps
more
would
have
come
of
this
if
their
men
had
backed
them
up
but
the
men
by
and
large
were
realists
having
a
kid
was
a
headache
these
days
this
new
business
of
injections
was
so
bad
when
you
came
right
down
to
it
there
still
be
youngsters
around
and
you
get
the
same
allotment
for
extra
living
space
only
the
way
it
worked
out
there
be
more
room
and
the
kids
would
eat
less
pretty
good
deal
and
it
was
as
if
the
young
ones
were
harmed
some
of
them
seemed
to
be
a
lot
smarter
than
ordinary
like
on
some
of
the
big
quizshows
youngsters
of
eight
and
nine
were
winning
all
those
big
prizes
bright
little
ones
of
course
these
must
be
the
ones
raised
in
the
first
special
school
the
government
had
set
up
they
said
old
leffingwell
the
guy
who
invented
the
shots
was
running
it
himself
sort
of
experimenting
to
see
how
this
new
crop
of
kids
would
make
out
it
was
when
harry
learned
about
the
school
that
he
knew
what
he
must
do
and
if
nobody
else
would
help
him
he
act
on
his
own
there
might
not
be
any
help
from
organized
society
but
he
still
had
disorganized
society
to
turn
to
he
spent
the
next
two
years
and
the
last
of
his
money
finding
a
way
the
pattern
of
criminality
had
changed
too
and
it
was
no
easy
matter
to
find
the
assistance
he
needed
about
the
only
group
crime
still
flourishing
was
hijacking
it
took
him
a
long
while
to
locate
a
small
outfit
which
operated
around
louie
and
arrange
to
obtain
a
helicopter
and
pilot
getting
hold
of
the
rifle
was
still
more
difficult
but
he
managed
and
by
the
time
everything
was
assembled
he
found
out
what
he
needed
to
know
about
leffingwell
and
his
school
as
he
suspected
the
school
was
located
in
the
old
canyon
right
in
the
same
buildings
which
had
once
served
as
experimental
units
how
many
youngsters
were
there
harry
did
know
maybe
manschoff
was
still
on
the
staff
and
maybe
they
brought
in
a
whole
new
staff
these
things
did
matter
what
mattered
was
that
leffingwell
was
on
the
premises
and
a
man
who
knew
his
way
about
a
man
who
worked
alone
and
to
a
single
purpose
could
reach
him
thus
it
was
that
harry
collins
crouched
behind
the
boulder
that
bright
may
morning
and
waited
for
leffingwell
to
appear
the
helicopter
had
dropped
him
at
the
upper
end
of
the
canyon
the
day
before
giving
him
a
chance
to
reconnoitre
and
familiarize
himself
with
the
terrain
once
again
he
located
leffingwell
quarters
even
seen
the
man
through
one
of
the
lower
windows
harry
had
no
trouble
recognizing
him
the
face
was
only
too
familiar
from
a
thousand
viewed
on
a
thousand
screens
inevitably
some
time
today
he
emerge
from
the
building
and
when
he
did
harry
would
be
waiting
he
shifted
behind
the
rocks
and
stretched
his
legs
twelve
years
had
passed
and
now
he
come
full
circle
the
whole
business
had
started
here
and
here
it
must
end
that
was
simple
justice
it
is
harry
told
himself
not
because
there
be
no
point
to
revenge
that
was
only
melodramatic
nonsense
he
was
no
monte
cristo
come
to
wreak
vengeance
on
his
cruel
oppressors
and
he
was
no
madman
no
victim
of
a
monomaniacal
obsession
what
he
was
doing
was
the
result
of
lengthy
and
logical
consideration
if
harry
collins
longtime
fugitive
from
a
government
treatment
center
tried
to
take
his
story
to
the
people
he
be
silenced
without
a
hearing
but
his
story
must
be
heard
there
was
only
one
way
to
arrest
the
attention
of
a
nation
with
the
report
of
a
rifle
a
bullet
in
leffingwell
brain
that
was
the
solution
of
the
problem
overnight
the
assassin
would
become
a
national
figure
undoubtedly
try
him
and
undoubtedly
condemn
him
but
first
he
have
his
day
in
court
he
get
a
chance
to
speak
out
he
give
all
the
voiceless
unorganized
victims
of
the
leff
law
a
reason
for
rebellion
and
offer
them
an
example
if
leffingwell
had
to
die
it
would
be
in
a
good
cause
moreover
he
deserved
to
die
had
he
killed
men
women
infants
without
mercy
it
not
harry
repeated
i
know
what
i
doing
maybe
i
was
disturbed
before
but
i
sane
now
perfectly
logical
perfectly
calm
perfectly
yes
and
now
his
sane
logical
calm
controlled
eyes
noted
that
the
distant
door
was
opening
and
he
sighted
through
the
and
brought
his
sane
logical
calm
controlled
hand
up
along
the
barrel
to
the
trigger
he
could
see
the
two
men
emerging
and
the
shorter
plumper
of
the
two
was
leffingwell
he
squinted
at
the
high
forehead
with
its
receding
hairline
it
was
a
perfect
target
a
little
squeeze
now
and
he
knew
what
would
happen
in
his
sane
logical
calm
controlled
mind
he
could
visualize
the
way
the
black
hole
would
appear
in
the
center
of
that
forehead
while
behind
it
would
be
the
torn
and
dripping
redness
flecked
with
gray
what
are
you
doing
harry
whirled
staring
staring
down
at
the
infant
who
stood
smiling
beside
him
it
an
infant
that
was
obvious
enough
and
implicit
in
the
diminutive
stature
the
delicate
limbs
and
the
oversized
head
but
infants
do
not
wear
the
clothing
of
boys
they
do
not
enunciate
with
clarity
they
do
not
stare
coolly
and
knowingly
at
their
elders
they
do
not
say
why
do
you
want
to
harm
dr
leffingwell
harry
gazed
into
the
wide
eyes
he
could
speak
you
sick
are
you
the
child
persisted
let
me
call
the
doctor
he
can
help
you
harry
swung
the
rifle
around
i
give
you
just
ten
seconds
to
clear
out
of
here
before
i
shoot
the
child
shook
his
head
then
he
took
a
step
forward
you
hurt
me
he
said
gravely
you
just
sick
that
why
you
talk
this
way
harry
leveled
the
rifle
i
not
sick
he
muttered
i
know
what
doing
and
i
know
all
about
you
too
you
one
of
them
are
you
one
of
the
first
of
leffingwell
brood
of
illegitimates
the
child
took
another
step
forward
i
not
illegitimate
he
said
i
know
who
i
am
i
seen
the
records
my
name
is
harry
collins
somewhere
the
rifle
exploded
the
bullet
hurtling
harmlessly
overhead
but
harry
did
hear
it
all
he
could
hear
exploding
in
his
own
brain
as
he
went
down
into
darkness
was
the
sane
logical
calm
controlled
voice
of
his
son
michael
cavendish
mike
was
just
coming
through
the
clump
of
trees
when
the
boy
began
to
wave
at
him
he
shifted
the
clumsy
old
jeffrey
cursing
the
weight
as
he
quickened
his
pace
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
he
had
to
carry
the
gun
himself
none
of
the
boys
were
big
enough
he
wondered
what
it
had
been
like
in
the
old
days
when
you
could
get
fullsized
bearers
there
used
to
be
game
all
over
the
place
too
and
a
white
hunter
was
king
and
what
was
there
left
now
nothing
but
pygmies
all
of
them
scurrying
around
and
beating
the
brush
for
dibatags
and
gerenuks
when
he
was
still
a
boy
mike
had
seen
the
last
of
the
big
antelopes
go
the
last
of
the
wildebeestes
and
zebra
too
then
the
carnivores
followed
the
lions
and
the
leopards
was
dead
and
just
as
well
these
natives
would
never
dare
to
come
out
of
the
villages
if
they
knew
any
lions
were
left
most
of
them
had
gone
to
cape
and
the
other
cities
anyway
handling
cattle
was
too
much
of
a
chore
except
on
a
government
farm
those
cows
looked
like
moving
mountains
alongside
the
average
boy
of
course
there
were
still
some
of
the
older
generation
left
kikiyu
and
even
a
few
watusi
but
the
free
inoculations
had
begun
many
years
ago
and
the
moved
at
an
accelerated
pace
here
natives
grew
old
and
died
at
thirty
they
matured
at
fifteen
now
with
the
shortage
of
game
the
elders
perished
still
more
swiftly
and
only
the
young
remained
outside
the
cities
and
the
farm
projects
mike
smiled
as
he
waited
for
the
boy
to
come
up
to
him
he
smiling
at
the
boy
he
was
smiling
at
himself
for
being
here
he
ought
to
be
in
cape
too
or
kenyarobi
damned
silly
this
business
of
being
a
white
hunter
when
there
was
nothing
left
to
hunt
but
somehow
he
stayed
on
since
dad
died
there
were
a
few
compensations
at
least
here
in
the
forests
a
man
could
still
move
about
a
bit
taste
privacy
and
solitude
and
the
strange
exotic
tropical
fruit
called
loneliness
even
was
vanishing
today
it
was
compensation
enough
perhaps
for
lugging
this
damned
jeffrey
mike
tried
to
remember
the
last
time
he
fired
it
at
a
living
target
a
year
two
years
yes
almost
two
that
gorilla
up
in
ruwenzori
country
at
least
the
boys
swore
it
was
he
had
hit
it
anyway
got
away
in
the
darkness
probably
he
been
shooting
at
a
shadow
there
were
no
more
gorillas
maybe
had
been
taking
the
shots
too
perhaps
they
all
turned
into
rhesus
monkeys
mike
watched
the
boy
run
towards
him
it
was
a
good
five
hundred
yards
from
the
river
bank
and
the
short
brown
legs
could
move
very
swiftly
he
wondered
what
it
felt
like
to
be
small
one
sense
of
proportion
must
be
different
and
that
in
turn
would
affect
sense
of
values
what
values
applied
to
the
world
about
you
when
you
were
only
three
feet
high
mike
would
know
he
was
a
big
man
almost
five
feet
seven
sometimes
mike
reflected
on
what
things
might
be
like
if
he
been
born
say
twenty
years
later
by
that
time
almost
everyone
would
be
a
product
of
leff
shots
and
he
be
no
exception
he
might
stay
with
people
his
own
age
in
kenyarobi
without
feeling
clumsy
conspicuous
pressed
he
had
to
admit
that
was
part
of
the
reason
he
preferred
to
remain
out
here
at
dad
old
place
now
he
could
tolerate
the
stares
of
the
natives
but
whenever
he
ventured
into
a
city
he
felt
awkward
under
the
scrutiny
of
the
young
people
the
way
those
looked
up
at
him
made
him
feel
a
monster
rather
better
to
endure
the
monotony
the
emptiness
out
here
yes
and
wait
for
a
chance
to
hunt
even
though
nine
times
out
of
ten
it
turned
out
to
be
a
wild
during
the
past
year
or
so
mike
had
hunted
nothing
but
legends
and
rumors
spent
his
time
stalking
shadows
then
the
villagers
had
come
to
him
three
days
ago
with
their
wild
story
even
when
he
heard
it
he
realized
it
must
be
pure
fable
and
the
more
they
insisted
the
more
they
protested
the
more
he
realized
it
simply
could
be
still
he
come
anything
to
experience
some
action
anything
to
create
the
illusion
of
purpose
of
shrieked
the
boy
excited
beyond
all
pretense
of
caution
up
ahead
in
river
you
come
quick
you
see
no
it
could
be
the
government
surveys
were
thorough
the
last
record
of
a
specimen
dated
back
over
a
years
ago
it
was
impossible
that
any
survivors
remained
and
all
during
the
safari
these
past
days
not
a
sign
or
a
print
or
a
spoor
shrilled
the
boy
come
quick
mike
cradled
the
gun
and
started
forward
the
other
bearers
shuffled
behind
him
unable
to
keep
pace
because
of
their
short
legs
and
he
suspected
unwilling
to
do
so
for
fear
of
what
might
lie
ahead
halfway
towards
the
river
bank
mike
halted
now
he
could
hear
the
rumbling
the
unmistakable
rumbling
and
now
he
could
smell
the
rank
mustiness
borne
on
the
hot
breeze
well
at
least
he
was
the
boy
behind
him
trembled
eyes
wide
he
seen
something
all
right
maybe
just
a
crocodile
though
still
some
crocs
around
and
he
doubted
if
a
young
native
would
know
the
difference
nevertheless
mike
felt
a
sudden
surge
of
unfamiliar
excitement
half
expectancy
and
half
fear
wallowed
in
the
river
something
that
rumbled
and
exuded
the
stench
of
life
now
they
were
approaching
the
trees
bordering
the
bank
mike
checked
his
gun
carefully
then
he
advanced
until
his
body
was
aligned
with
the
trees
from
here
he
could
see
and
not
be
seen
he
could
peer
down
at
the
river
or
the
place
where
the
river
had
been
during
the
rainy
season
long
past
now
it
was
nothing
but
a
mudwallow
under
the
glaring
sun
a
huge
mudwallow
pitted
with
deep
circular
indentations
and
dotted
with
dung
but
in
the
middle
of
it
stood
was
a
mountain
was
a
black
block
of
breathing
basalt
roared
and
snorted
and
rolled
red
eyes
mike
gasped
he
was
a
white
hunter
but
he
never
seen
a
bull
elephant
before
and
this
one
stood
eleven
feet
at
the
shoulders
if
it
stood
an
inch
the
biggest
creature
walking
the
face
of
the
earth
it
had
risen
from
the
mud
abandoned
its
wallowing
as
its
trunk
curled
about
sensitive
to
the
unfamiliar
scent
of
man
its
ears
rose
like
the
outspread
wings
of
some
gigantic
jungle
bat
mike
could
see
the
flies
buzzing
around
the
ragged
edges
he
stared
at
the
great
tusks
that
were
veined
and
yellowed
and
broken
once
men
had
hunted
elephants
for
ivory
he
remembered
but
how
could
they
even
with
guns
how
had
they
dared
to
confront
a
moving
mountain
mike
tried
to
swallow
but
his
throat
was
dry
the
stock
slipped
through
his
clammy
hands
shoot
implored
the
boy
beside
him
you
shoot
now
mike
gazed
down
the
elephant
was
aware
of
him
it
turned
deliberately
staring
up
the
bank
as
it
swayed
on
the
four
black
pillars
of
its
legs
mike
could
see
its
eyes
set
in
a
mass
of
grayish
wrinkles
the
eyes
had
recognized
him
they
knew
he
realized
the
eyes
knew
all
about
him
who
he
was
and
what
he
was
and
what
he
had
come
here
to
do
the
eyes
had
seen
man
before
perhaps
long
before
mike
was
born
they
understood
everything
the
gun
and
the
presence
and
the
purpose
shoot
the
boy
cried
not
bothering
to
hold
his
voice
down
any
longer
for
the
elephant
was
moving
slowly
towards
the
side
of
the
wallow
moving
deliberately
to
firmer
footing
and
the
boy
was
afraid
mike
was
afraid
too
but
he
could
shoot
no
he
murmured
let
him
go
i
ca
kill
him
you
must
the
boy
said
you
promise
look
all
the
meat
meat
for
two
three
villages
mike
shook
his
head
i
ca
do
it
he
said
that
is
meat
that
life
bigger
life
than
we
are
do
you
understand
oh
the
bloody
hell
with
it
come
on
the
boy
was
listening
to
him
he
was
watching
the
elephant
and
now
he
started
to
tremble
for
the
elephant
was
moving
up
onto
solid
ground
it
moved
slowly
daintily
almost
mincing
as
its
legs
sampled
the
surface
of
the
shore
then
it
looked
up
and
this
time
there
was
no
doubt
as
to
the
direction
of
its
gaze
it
stared
intently
at
mike
and
the
boy
on
the
bank
its
ears
fanned
then
flared
suddenly
the
elephant
raised
its
trunk
and
trumpeted
fiercely
and
then
lowering
the
black
of
its
head
the
beast
came
forward
a
deceptively
slow
lope
a
scarcely
accelerated
trot
and
then
all
at
once
it
was
moving
swiftly
swiftly
and
surely
and
inexorably
towards
them
the
angle
of
the
bank
was
not
steep
and
the
elephant
speed
never
slackened
on
the
slope
its
right
shoulder
struck
a
sapling
and
the
sapling
splintered
it
was
crashing
forward
in
full
charge
again
it
trumpeted
trunk
extended
like
a
flail
of
doom
shoot
screamed
the
boy
mike
did
want
to
shoot
he
wanted
to
run
he
wanted
to
flee
the
mountain
flee
the
incredible
breathing
bulk
of
this
grotesque
giant
but
he
was
a
white
hunter
he
was
a
man
and
a
man
is
not
a
beast
a
man
does
not
run
away
from
life
in
any
shape
or
size
the
trunk
came
up
mike
raised
the
gun
he
heard
the
monster
roar
far
away
and
then
he
heard
another
sound
that
must
be
the
discharge
and
something
hit
him
in
the
shoulder
and
knocked
him
down
recoil
yes
because
the
elephant
was
there
any
more
he
could
hear
the
crashing
and
thrashing
down
below
over
the
rim
of
the
river
bank
mike
stood
up
he
saw
the
boy
running
now
running
back
to
the
bearers
huddled
along
the
edge
of
the
trail
he
rubbed
his
shoulder
picked
up
his
gun
reloaded
the
sounds
from
below
had
ceased
slowly
mike
advanced
to
the
lip
of
the
bank
and
stared
down
the
bull
elephant
had
fallen
and
rolled
into
the
wallow
once
more
it
had
taken
a
direct
hit
just
beneath
the
right
ear
and
even
as
mike
watched
its
trunk
writhed
feebly
like
a
dying
serpent
then
fell
forward
into
the
mud
the
gigantic
ears
twitched
then
flickered
and
flopped
and
the
huge
body
rolled
and
settled
suddenly
mike
began
to
cry
damn
it
he
had
to
shoot
if
the
elephant
had
charged
like
that
but
the
elephant
to
charge
just
as
he
to
shoot
that
was
the
whole
secret
the
secret
of
life
and
the
secret
of
death
too
mike
turned
away
facing
the
east
kenyarobi
was
east
and
he
be
going
there
now
nothing
to
hold
him
here
in
the
forests
any
longer
he
would
even
wait
for
the
big
feast
to
hell
with
anyway
his
hunting
days
were
over
mike
walked
slowly
up
the
trail
to
the
waiting
boys
and
behind
him
in
the
wallow
the
flies
settled
down
on
the
lifeless
carcass
of
the
last
elephant
in
the
world
harry
collins
the
guards
at
stark
falls
were
under
strict
orders
not
to
talk
each
prisoner
here
was
exercised
alone
in
a
courtyard
runway
and
meals
were
served
in
the
cells
the
cells
were
comfortable
enough
and
while
there
were
no
telescreens
books
were
available
genuine
books
which
must
have
been
preserved
from
libraries
dismantled
fifty
years
ago
or
more
harry
collins
found
no
titles
dated
later
than
every
day
or
so
an
attendant
wheeled
around
a
cart
piled
high
with
the
dusty
volumes
harry
read
to
pass
the
time
at
first
he
kept
anticipating
his
trial
but
after
a
while
he
almost
forgot
about
that
possibility
and
it
was
well
over
a
year
before
he
got
a
chance
to
tell
his
story
to
anyone
when
his
opportunity
came
his
audience
did
not
consist
of
judge
or
jury
doctor
lawyer
or
penologist
he
spoke
only
to
richard
wade
a
who
had
been
thrust
into
the
adjoining
cell
on
the
evening
of
october
harry
spoke
haltingly
at
first
but
as
he
progressed
the
words
came
more
easily
and
emotion
lent
its
own
eloquence
his
unseen
auditor
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
did
not
interrupt
or
question
him
it
was
enough
for
harry
that
there
someone
to
listen
at
last
so
it
was
a
bit
like
i
expected
he
concluded
no
trial
no
publicity
i
never
seen
leffingwell
again
nor
manschoff
nobody
questioned
me
by
the
time
i
recovered
consciousness
i
was
here
in
prison
buried
alive
richard
wade
spoke
slowly
for
the
first
time
you
lucky
they
might
have
shot
you
down
on
the
spot
that
just
what
bothers
me
harry
told
him
why
did
they
kill
me
why
lock
me
up
this
way
there
are
many
prisons
left
these
days
with
food
and
space
at
such
a
premium
there
are
prisons
left
at
all
officially
wade
said
just
as
there
are
no
longer
any
cemeteries
but
important
people
are
still
given
private
burials
and
their
remains
secretly
preserved
all
a
matter
of
influence
i
no
influence
i
not
important
would
you
think
consider
it
risky
to
keep
me
alive
under
the
circumstances
if
there
ever
be
an
investigation
who
would
investigate
not
the
government
surely
but
suppose
there
a
political
turnover
suppose
congress
want
to
make
capital
of
the
situation
there
is
no
congress
harry
gasped
no
congress
as
of
last
month
it
was
dissolved
henceforth
we
are
governed
by
the
cabinet
with
authority
delegated
to
department
heads
but
that
preposterous
nobody
stand
still
for
something
like
that
they
did
stand
still
most
of
them
after
a
year
of
careful
preparation
of
wholesale
of
congressional
graft
and
corruption
and
inefficiency
turned
out
that
congress
was
the
villain
all
along
the
senators
and
representatives
had
finagled
and
restrictive
which
kept
our
food
supply
down
they
were
opposing
international
federation
in
plain
language
people
were
sold
a
bill
of
goods
get
rid
of
congress
and
you
have
more
food
that
did
it
but
you
think
the
politicians
themselves
would
realize
they
were
cutting
their
own
throats
the
state
legislatures
and
the
governors
legislatures
were
dissolved
by
the
same
agreement
wade
went
on
there
are
no
states
any
more
just
governmental
districts
based
upon
sensible
considerations
of
area
and
population
this
is
the
expanding
economy
based
on
obsolescence
and
conspicuous
consumption
the
primary
problem
at
the
moment
is
sheer
survival
in
a
way
the
move
makes
sense
political
machinery
could
cope
with
the
situation
there
no
time
for
debate
when
instantaneous
decisions
are
necessary
to
national
welfare
heard
how
civil
liberties
were
suspended
during
the
old
wars
well
there
a
war
on
right
now
a
war
against
hunger
a
war
against
the
forces
of
fecundity
in
another
dozen
years
or
so
when
the
leff
shot
generation
is
fullgrown
and
a
lot
of
the
elderly
have
died
off
the
tensions
will
ease
meanwhile
quick
action
is
necessary
arbitrary
action
but
you
defending
dictatorship
richard
wade
made
a
sound
which
is
usually
accompanied
by
a
derisive
shrug
am
i
well
i
did
when
i
was
outside
and
that
why
here
now
harry
collins
cleared
his
throat
what
did
you
do
if
you
refer
to
my
profession
i
was
a
scripter
if
you
refer
to
my
alleged
criminal
activity
i
made
the
error
of
thinking
the
way
you
do
and
the
worse
error
of
attempting
to
inject
such
attitudes
in
my
scripts
seems
that
when
congress
was
formally
dissolved
there
was
some
notion
of
preparing
a
timely
show
a
sort
of
historical
review
of
the
body
using
old
film
clips
what
my
superiors
had
in
mind
was
a
comedy
of
errors
a
cavalcade
of
mistakes
and
misdeeds
showing
just
why
we
were
better
off
without
supporting
a
political
sideshow
well
i
carried
out
the
assignment
and
edited
the
films
but
when
i
drafted
a
rough
commentary
i
made
the
mistake
of
taking
both
a
pro
and
con
slant
nothing
like
that
ever
reached
the
telescreens
of
course
but
what
i
did
was
promptly
noted
they
came
for
me
at
once
and
hustled
me
off
here
i
did
get
a
hearing
or
a
trial
either
but
why
did
they
execute
you
or
harry
hesitated
is
that
what
you
expect
why
did
they
execute
wade
shot
back
he
was
silent
for
a
moment
before
continuing
no
i
do
expect
anything
like
that
now
they
have
done
it
on
the
spot
if
they
intended
to
do
so
at
all
no
i
got
another
idea
about
people
like
you
and
myself
and
about
some
of
the
congressmen
and
senators
who
dropped
out
of
sight
too
i
think
we
being
stockpiled
stockpiled
it
all
part
of
a
plan
give
me
a
little
time
to
think
we
can
talk
again
later
wade
chuckled
once
more
looks
as
if
there
be
ample
opportunity
in
the
future
and
there
was
in
the
months
ahead
harry
spoke
frequently
with
his
friend
behind
the
wall
he
never
saw
him
prisoners
at
stark
falls
were
exercised
separately
and
there
was
no
group
assembly
or
recreation
surprisingly
adequate
meals
were
served
in
surprisingly
comfortable
cells
in
the
matter
of
necessities
harry
had
no
complaints
and
now
that
he
had
someone
to
talk
to
the
time
seemed
to
go
more
swiftly
he
learned
a
great
deal
about
richard
wade
during
the
next
few
years
mostly
wade
liked
to
reminisce
about
the
old
days
he
talked
about
working
for
the
networks
the
networks
privately
owned
which
flourished
before
the
government
took
over
communications
media
in
the
that
where
you
got
your
start
eh
harry
asked
lord
no
boy
i
a
lot
more
ancient
than
you
think
why
pushing
born
in
that
right
during
world
war
ii
i
can
almost
remember
the
atomic
bomb
and
i
sure
as
hell
remember
the
sputniks
it
was
a
crazy
period
let
me
tell
you
the
pessimists
worried
about
the
russians
blowing
us
up
and
the
optimists
were
sure
we
had
a
glorious
future
in
the
conquest
of
space
ever
hear
that
old
fable
about
the
blind
men
examining
an
elephant
well
that
the
way
most
people
were
each
of
them
groping
around
and
trying
to
determine
the
exact
shape
of
things
to
come
a
few
of
us
even
made
a
little
money
from
it
for
a
while
writing
science
fiction
that
how
i
got
my
start
you
were
a
writer
sold
my
first
story
when
i
was
eighteen
or
so
kept
on
writing
off
and
on
for
almost
twenty
years
of
course
robertson
formula
came
along
in
and
after
that
everything
went
to
pot
it
knocked
out
the
chances
of
future
war
but
it
also
knocked
out
the
interest
in
speculation
or
so
i
moved
over
into
television
for
a
while
and
stayed
with
it
but
the
old
science
fiction
was
fun
while
it
lasted
ever
read
any
of
it
no
harry
admitted
that
was
all
before
my
time
tell
me
though
did
any
of
it
make
sense
i
mean
did
some
of
those
writers
foresee
what
was
really
going
to
happen
there
were
plenty
of
penny
prophets
and
nickel
nostradamuses
wade
told
him
but
as
i
said
most
of
them
were
assuming
war
with
the
communists
or
a
new
era
of
space
travel
since
communism
collapsed
and
space
flight
was
just
an
expensive
journey
to
a
dead
end
and
dead
worlds
it
follows
that
the
majority
of
fictional
futures
were
founded
on
fallacies
and
all
the
rest
of
the
extrapolations
dealt
with
superficial
social
manifestations
for
example
they
wrote
about
civilizations
dominated
by
advertising
and
techniques
it
true
that
during
my
childhood
this
seemed
to
be
a
logical
trend
but
once
demand
exceeded
supply
the
whole
mechanism
of
demand
which
was
chief
function
bogged
down
and
techniques
today
are
dedicated
almost
entirely
to
maintaining
minimum
resistance
to
a
system
insuring
our
survival
another
popular
idea
was
based
on
the
notion
of
an
expanding
matriarchy
a
gerontomatriarchy
rather
in
which
older
women
would
take
control
in
an
age
when
women
outlived
men
by
a
number
of
years
this
seemed
possible
now
of
course
shortened
working
hours
and
medical
advances
have
equalized
the
and
since
private
property
has
become
less
and
less
of
a
factor
in
dominating
our
collective
destinies
it
hardly
matters
whether
the
male
or
the
female
has
the
upper
hand
then
there
was
the
common
theory
that
technological
advances
would
result
in
a
society
where
automatons
would
do
all
the
work
and
so
they
might
if
we
had
an
unlimited
supply
of
raw
materials
to
produce
robots
and
unlimited
to
activate
them
as
we
now
realize
atomic
power
can
not
be
utilized
on
a
minute
scale
last
but
not
least
there
was
the
concept
of
a
system
with
particular
emphasis
on
psychotherapy
neurosurgery
and
parapsychology
the
world
was
going
to
be
run
by
telepaths
psychosis
eliminated
by
brainwashing
intellect
developed
by
hypnotic
suggestion
it
sounded
great
but
the
conquest
of
physical
disease
has
occupied
the
medical
profession
almost
exclusively
no
what
they
all
seemed
to
overlook
with
only
a
few
exceptions
was
the
population
problem
you
ca
run
a
world
through
advertising
when
there
are
so
many
people
that
there
are
enough
goods
to
go
around
anyway
you
ca
turn
it
over
to
big
business
when
big
government
has
virtually
absorbed
all
of
the
commercial
and
industrial
functions
just
to
cope
with
an
demand
a
matriarchy
loses
its
meaning
when
the
individual
family
unit
changes
character
under
the
stress
of
an
increasing
which
eliminates
the
home
family
circle
and
social
pattern
and
the
more
we
must
conserve
dwindling
natural
resources
for
people
the
less
we
can
expend
on
experimentation
with
robots
and
machinery
as
for
the
society
there
are
just
too
many
patients
and
not
enough
physicians
i
do
have
to
remind
you
that
the
military
caste
lost
its
chance
of
control
when
war
disappeared
and
that
religion
is
losing
ground
every
day
are
vanishing
and
racial
distinctions
will
be
going
next
the
old
idea
of
a
world
federation
is
becoming
more
and
more
practical
once
the
political
barriers
are
down
miscegenation
will
finish
the
job
but
nobody
seemed
to
foresee
this
particular
future
they
all
made
the
mistake
of
worrying
about
the
instead
of
the
harry
nodded
thoughtfully
although
wade
could
see
his
response
but
is
it
true
that
there
a
little
bit
of
each
of
these
concepts
in
our
actual
situation
today
he
asked
i
mean
government
and
business
virtually
one
and
the
same
and
they
do
use
propaganda
techniques
to
control
all
media
as
for
scientific
research
look
at
how
we
rebuilt
our
cities
and
developed
synthetics
for
food
and
fuel
and
clothing
and
shelter
when
it
comes
to
medicine
leffingwell
and
his
inoculations
is
that
all
along
the
lines
of
your
early
science
fiction
where
your
underground
richard
wade
demanded
my
your
underground
wade
repeated
hell
every
science
fiction
yarn
about
a
future
society
had
its
underground
that
was
the
whole
gimmick
in
the
plot
the
hero
was
a
conformist
who
tangled
with
the
social
order
come
to
think
of
it
that
what
did
years
ago
only
instead
of
becoming
an
impotent
victim
of
the
system
he
meet
up
with
the
underground
movement
not
some
sourball
like
your
friend
ritchie
who
tried
to
operate
on
his
own
hook
without
real
plans
or
system
but
a
complete
organization
bent
on
starting
a
revolution
and
taking
over
there
be
wise
old
priests
and
wise
old
crooks
and
wise
old
officers
and
wise
old
officials
all
playing
a
double
game
and
planning
a
spies
all
over
the
place
get
me
and
in
no
time
at
all
our
hero
would
be
playing
tag
with
the
top
figures
in
the
government
that
how
it
worked
out
in
all
the
stories
but
what
happens
in
real
life
what
happened
to
you
for
example
you
fell
for
a
series
of
stupid
tricks
stupidly
perpetrated
because
the
people
in
power
people
and
not
the
kind
of
synthetic
dreamed
up
by
frustrated
you
found
out
that
the
logical
candidates
to
constitute
an
underground
were
the
naturalists
again
they
were
just
ordinary
individuals
with
no
genius
for
organization
as
for
coming
in
contact
with
key
figures
you
were
actually
on
hand
when
leffingwell
completed
his
experiments
and
you
came
back
years
later
to
hunt
him
down
very
much
in
the
heroic
tradition
i
admit
but
you
never
saw
the
man
except
through
the
telescopic
sights
of
your
rifle
that
was
the
end
of
it
no
machiavelli
has
hauled
you
in
to
play
games
with
you
and
no
futuristic
freud
has
bothered
to
wash
your
brain
or
your
subconscious
you
just
are
that
important
collins
but
they
put
me
in
a
special
prison
why
who
knows
they
put
me
here
too
you
said
something
once
about
stockpiling
us
what
did
you
mean
well
it
was
just
an
old
science
fiction
idea
i
suppose
i
tell
you
about
it
tomorrow
eh
and
so
the
matter
and
harry
collins
rested
for
the
night
the
next
day
richard
wade
was
gone
harry
called
to
him
and
there
was
no
answer
and
he
cried
out
and
he
cursed
and
he
paced
his
cell
and
he
walked
alone
in
the
courtyard
and
he
begged
the
impassive
guards
for
information
and
he
sweated
and
he
talked
to
himself
and
he
counted
the
days
and
he
lost
count
of
the
days
then
all
at
once
there
was
another
prisoner
in
the
adjacent
cell
and
his
name
was
william
chang
and
he
was
a
biologist
he
was
reticent
about
the
crime
he
had
committed
but
quite
voluble
about
the
crimes
committed
by
others
in
the
world
outside
much
of
what
he
said
about
genes
and
chromosomes
and
recessive
characteristics
and
mutation
seemed
incomprehensible
to
harry
but
in
their
talks
one
thing
emerged
clearly
enough
chang
was
concerned
for
the
future
of
the
race
leffingwell
should
have
waited
he
said
it
the
generation
that
will
be
important
as
i
tried
to
tell
my
people
is
that
why
you
here
chang
sighed
i
suppose
so
they
would
listen
of
course
overpopulation
has
always
been
the
curse
of
asia
and
this
seemed
to
be
such
an
obvious
solution
but
who
knows
the
time
may
come
when
they
need
men
like
myself
so
you
were
stockpiled
too
what
that
harry
told
him
about
richard
wade
remarks
and
together
they
tried
to
puzzle
out
the
theory
behind
them
but
not
for
long
because
once
again
harry
collins
awoke
in
the
morning
to
find
the
adjoining
cell
empty
and
once
again
he
was
alone
for
a
long
time
at
last
a
new
neighbor
came
his
name
was
lars
neilstrom
neilstrom
talked
to
him
of
ships
and
shoes
and
and
the
thousand
and
one
things
men
will
discuss
in
their
loneliness
and
frustration
including
inevitably
their
reasons
for
being
here
neilstrom
had
been
an
instructor
under
vocational
apt
and
he
was
at
a
loss
to
explain
his
presence
at
stark
falls
when
harry
spoke
of
the
stockpiling
theory
his
demurred
it
more
like
kafka
than
science
fiction
he
said
but
then
i
do
suppose
you
ever
read
any
kafka
yes
i
have
harry
told
him
since
i
came
here
i
done
nothing
but
read
old
books
lately
they
been
giving
me
microscans
been
studying
up
on
biology
and
genetics
talking
to
chang
got
me
interested
in
fact
i
really
going
in
for
nothing
else
to
do
that
the
only
method
left
nowadays
neilstrom
sounded
bitter
i
do
know
what
going
to
become
of
our
heritage
of
knowledge
in
the
future
i
not
speaking
of
technological
skill
scientific
information
is
carefully
preserved
but
the
humanities
are
virtually
lost
the
concept
of
the
individual
is
forgotten
and
when
i
think
of
the
crisis
to
come
what
crisis
a
new
generation
is
growing
up
ten
or
fifteen
years
from
now
have
succeeded
in
erasing
political
and
racial
and
religious
divisions
but
there
be
a
new
and
more
dangerous
differentiation
a
one
what
do
you
think
will
happen
when
half
the
world
is
around
six
feet
tall
and
the
other
half
under
three
i
ca
imagine
well
i
can
the
trouble
is
most
people
do
realize
what
the
problem
will
be
things
have
moved
too
swiftly
why
there
were
more
changes
in
the
last
hundred
years
than
in
the
previous
thousand
and
the
rate
of
acceleration
increases
up
until
now
we
been
concerned
about
too
rapid
technological
development
but
what
we
have
to
worry
about
is
social
development
most
people
have
been
conditioned
to
conform
yes
that
our
job
in
vocational
apt
but
the
system
only
works
when
there
a
single
standard
of
conformity
in
a
few
years
there
be
a
double
one
based
on
size
what
then
harry
wanted
some
time
to
consider
the
matter
but
the
question
was
never
answered
because
lars
neilstrom
went
away
in
the
night
as
had
his
predecessors
before
him
and
in
succeeding
interludes
harry
came
to
know
a
other
transient
occupants
of
the
cell
next
to
his
they
came
from
all
over
and
they
had
many
things
to
discuss
but
always
there
was
the
problem
of
they
were
there
and
the
memory
of
richard
wade
premise
concerning
stockpiling
there
came
a
time
when
the
memory
of
richard
wade
merged
with
the
memory
of
arnold
ritchie
the
past
was
a
dim
montage
of
life
at
the
agency
and
the
treatment
center
and
the
ranch
a
recollection
of
lying
on
the
river
bank
with
women
in
attitudes
of
opisthotonos
or
of
lying
against
the
boulders
with
a
rifle
somewhere
there
was
an
image
of
a
child
wide
eyes
and
a
voice
saying
my
name
is
harry
collins
but
that
seemed
very
far
away
what
was
real
was
the
cell
and
the
years
of
talking
and
reading
the
microscans
and
trying
to
find
a
pattern
harry
found
himself
describing
it
all
to
a
newcomer
who
said
his
name
was
austin
a
man
who
became
a
resident
of
the
next
cell
one
day
in
and
eventually
he
came
to
wade
theory
maybe
there
were
a
few
wiser
heads
who
foresaw
a
coming
crisis
he
concluded
maybe
they
anticipated
a
time
when
they
might
need
a
few
nonconformists
people
like
ourselves
who
have
been
passive
or
persuaded
maybe
we
the
government
insurance
policy
if
an
emergency
arises
we
be
freed
and
then
what
would
do
austin
asked
softly
you
against
the
system
are
you
yes
but
i
survival
harry
collins
spoke
slowly
thoughtfully
you
see
i
learned
something
through
the
years
of
study
and
contact
here
rebellion
is
not
the
answer
you
hated
leffingwell
yes
i
did
until
i
realized
that
all
this
was
inevitable
leffingwell
is
not
a
villain
and
neither
is
any
given
individual
in
or
out
of
government
our
road
to
hell
has
been
paved
with
only
the
very
best
of
intentions
killing
the
engineers
and
contractors
will
not
get
us
off
that
road
and
we
all
on
it
together
we
have
to
find
a
way
of
changing
the
direction
of
our
journey
the
young
people
will
be
too
anxious
to
merely
rush
blindly
ahead
most
of
my
generation
will
be
sheeplike
moving
as
part
of
the
herd
because
of
their
conditioning
only
we
rebels
will
be
capable
of
plotting
a
course
a
course
for
all
of
us
what
about
your
son
austin
asked
i
thinking
of
him
harry
collins
answered
of
him
and
of
all
the
others
maybe
he
does
not
need
me
maybe
none
of
them
need
me
maybe
it
all
an
illusion
but
if
the
time
ever
comes
i
be
ready
and
meanwhile
i
can
hope
the
time
has
come
austin
said
gently
and
then
he
was
standing
miraculously
enough
outside
his
cell
and
before
the
door
to
harry
cell
and
the
door
was
opening
and
once
again
harry
stared
into
the
wide
eyes
he
remembered
so
well
the
same
wide
eyes
set
in
the
face
of
a
fullgrown
man
a
fullgrown
man
three
feet
tall
he
stood
up
shakily
as
the
man
held
out
his
hand
and
said
hello
father
but
i
do
understand
i
waited
a
long
time
for
this
moment
i
had
to
talk
to
you
find
out
how
you
really
felt
so
that
i
be
sure
now
you
ready
to
join
us
what
happening
what
do
you
want
with
me
we
talk
later
harry
son
smiled
right
now
i
taking
you
home
eric
donovan
eric
was
glad
to
get
to
the
office
and
shut
the
door
lately
he
had
this
feeling
whenever
he
went
out
this
feeling
that
people
were
staring
at
him
it
was
just
his
imagination
they
did
stare
every
younger
person
over
a
yard
high
got
stared
at
nowadays
as
if
they
were
freaks
and
it
was
just
the
staring
that
got
him
down
either
sometimes
they
muttered
and
mumbled
and
sometimes
they
called
names
eric
did
mind
stuff
like
dirty
naturalist
that
he
could
understand
once
upon
a
time
way
back
everybody
who
was
against
the
leff
law
was
called
a
naturalist
and
before
that
it
had
still
another
meaning
or
so
he
been
told
today
of
course
it
just
meant
anyone
who
was
over
five
feet
tall
no
he
could
take
the
ordinary
all
right
but
sometimes
they
said
other
things
they
used
words
nobody
ever
uses
unless
they
really
hate
you
want
to
kill
you
and
that
was
at
the
bottom
of
it
eric
knew
they
did
hate
him
they
want
to
kill
him
was
he
a
coward
perhaps
but
it
was
just
eric
imagination
you
never
saw
anything
about
such
things
on
the
telescreens
but
naturalists
were
being
killed
every
day
the
older
people
were
still
in
the
majority
but
the
youngsters
were
coming
up
fast
and
there
were
so
many
of
them
besides
they
were
more
active
and
this
created
the
illusion
that
there
were
yardsticks
everywhere
eric
sat
down
behind
his
desk
grinning
when
he
was
a
kid
it
had
been
just
the
other
way
around
he
and
the
rest
of
them
who
did
get
shots
in
those
early
days
considered
themselves
to
be
the
normal
ones
and
did
the
names
like
runt
and
and
midgie
but
the
most
common
name
was
the
one
that
stuck
yardstick
that
used
to
be
the
worst
insult
of
all
but
now
it
was
an
insult
any
more
being
taller
was
the
insult
being
a
dirty
naturalist
or
a
times
certainly
had
changed
eric
glanced
at
the
communicator
almost
noon
and
it
had
not
flicked
yet
here
he
been
beaming
these
big
offers
you
think
he
get
some
response
to
an
expensive
beaming
program
but
no
maybe
that
was
the
trouble
nobody
liked
things
any
more
everything
was
small
he
shifted
uneasily
in
his
chair
that
was
one
consolation
at
least
he
still
had
furniture
getting
to
be
harder
and
harder
to
find
stuff
that
fitted
him
these
days
seemed
like
most
of
the
firms
making
furniture
and
bedding
and
household
appliances
were
turning
out
the
small
stuff
for
the
younger
generation
cheaper
to
make
less
material
and
more
demand
for
it
government
allocated
size
priorities
to
the
manufacturers
it
was
even
murder
to
ride
public
transportation
because
of
the
eric
drove
his
own
jetter
besides
that
way
was
safer
crowded
into
a
liner
with
a
gang
of
yardsticks
with
only
a
few
other
naturalists
around
there
might
be
trouble
oh
it
was
getting
to
be
a
yardstick
world
and
no
mistake
smaller
furniture
smaller
meals
smaller
sizes
in
clothing
smaller
buildings
that
reminded
eric
of
something
and
he
frowned
again
dammit
why
did
the
communicator
flick
he
should
be
getting
some
kind
of
inquiries
hell
he
was
practically
the
space
away
but
there
was
only
silence
as
there
had
been
all
during
this
past
week
that
why
he
let
lorette
go
sweet
girl
but
there
was
no
work
for
her
here
any
more
no
work
and
no
pay
either
besides
the
place
spooked
her
she
been
the
one
who
suggested
leaving
really
eric
i
sorry
but
i
just
ca
take
this
any
more
all
alone
in
this
huge
building
it
curling
my
toes
at
first
he
tried
to
talk
her
out
of
it
do
be
silly
luscious
there
bernstein
down
on
ten
and
saltonstall
above
us
and
wallaby
and
son
on
fourteen
i
tell
you
this
place
is
coming
back
to
life
i
can
feel
it
i
beam
for
tenants
next
week
you
see
actually
he
been
talking
against
his
own
fear
and
lorette
must
have
known
it
anyway
she
left
and
now
he
was
here
alone
eric
did
like
the
sound
of
that
word
or
the
absence
of
sound
behind
it
three
other
tenants
in
a
building
three
other
tenants
in
a
place
that
had
once
held
three
thousand
why
fifty
years
ago
when
this
place
went
up
you
could
buy
a
vacancy
where
had
the
crowds
gone
to
he
knew
the
answer
of
course
the
leff
shots
had
created
the
new
generation
of
yardsticks
and
they
lived
in
their
own
world
their
shrunken
dehydrated
world
of
and
miniatures
deserted
the
skyscrapers
and
cut
the
big
apartment
buildings
up
into
tiny
cubicles
two
could
occupy
the
space
formerly
reserved
for
one
that
had
been
the
purpose
of
the
leff
shots
in
the
first
place
to
put
an
end
to
overcrowding
and
conserve
on
resources
well
it
had
worked
out
worked
out
too
perfectly
for
people
like
eric
donovan
eric
donovan
rental
agent
for
a
building
nobody
wanted
any
more
a
mausoleum
and
nobody
could
collect
rent
from
ghosts
eric
damned
near
jumped
through
the
ceiling
when
the
door
opened
and
this
man
walked
in
he
was
tall
and
towheaded
eric
stared
there
was
something
vaguely
familiar
about
his
face
something
about
those
ears
that
was
it
those
ears
no
it
could
be
it
was
possible
eric
stood
up
and
held
out
his
hand
i
donovan
he
said
the
towheaded
man
smiled
and
nodded
yes
i
know
do
you
remember
me
i
thought
i
knew
you
from
someplace
you
would
be
sam
wolzek
the
towheaded
man
smile
became
a
broad
grin
that
not
what
you
were
going
to
say
eric
you
were
going
to
say
you
well
go
on
say
it
i
do
mind
i
been
called
a
lot
worse
things
since
we
were
kids
together
i
ca
believe
it
eric
murmured
it
really
you
old
wolzek
and
after
all
these
years
turning
up
to
rent
an
office
from
me
well
what
do
you
know
i
did
come
here
to
rent
an
office
oh
then
it
was
your
name
that
brought
me
i
recognized
it
on
the
beamings
then
this
is
a
social
call
eh
well
that
good
i
do
get
much
company
these
days
sit
down
have
a
reef
wolzek
sat
down
but
refused
the
smoke
i
know
quite
a
bit
about
your
setup
he
said
you
and
your
three
tenants
it
tough
eric
oh
things
could
be
worse
eric
forced
a
laugh
it
is
as
if
my
bucks
depended
on
the
number
of
tenants
in
the
building
government
subsidizes
this
place
i
sure
of
a
job
as
long
as
i
live
as
long
as
you
live
wolzek
stared
at
him
in
a
way
he
did
like
and
just
how
long
do
you
figure
that
to
be
i
only
eric
answered
according
to
statistics
that
gives
me
maybe
another
sixty
years
statistics
wolzek
said
it
like
a
dirty
word
your
is
determined
by
statistics
any
more
i
say
you
do
have
sixty
months
left
perhaps
not
even
sixty
days
what
are
you
trying
to
hand
me
the
truth
and
do
go
looking
for
a
silver
platter
underneath
it
either
but
i
mind
my
own
business
i
do
hurt
anybody
why
should
i
be
in
any
danger
why
does
a
government
subsidy
support
one
rental
manager
to
sit
here
in
this
building
every
day
but
ten
guards
to
patrol
it
every
night
eric
opened
his
mouth
wide
before
shaping
it
for
speech
who
told
you
that
like
i
said
i
know
the
setup
wolzek
crossed
his
legs
but
he
did
lean
back
and
in
case
you
have
guessed
it
this
is
a
business
call
not
a
social
one
eric
sighed
might
have
figured
he
said
you
a
naturalist
are
you
of
course
i
am
we
all
are
not
i
oh
yes
whether
you
like
it
or
not
you
a
naturalist
too
as
far
as
the
yardsticks
are
concerned
everyone
over
three
feet
high
is
a
naturalist
an
enemy
someone
to
be
hated
and
destroyed
think
i
believe
that
sure
i
know
they
do
like
us
and
why
should
they
we
eat
twice
as
much
take
up
twice
the
space
and
i
guess
when
we
were
kids
we
gave
a
lot
of
them
a
hard
time
besides
outside
of
a
few
exceptions
like
ourselves
all
the
younger
generation
are
yardsticks
with
more
coming
every
year
the
older
people
hold
the
key
positions
and
the
power
of
course
there
a
lot
of
friction
and
resentment
but
you
know
all
that
certainly
wolzek
nodded
all
that
and
more
much
more
i
know
that
up
until
a
few
years
ago
no
yardstick
held
any
public
office
or
government
position
now
they
starting
to
move
in
particularly
in
europasia
but
there
so
many
of
them
now
adults
in
their
early
twenties
that
the
pressure
is
building
up
they
impatient
getting
out
of
hand
they
wo
wait
until
the
old
folks
die
off
they
want
control
now
and
if
they
ever
manage
to
get
it
we
finished
for
good
impossible
eric
said
impossible
wolzek
voice
was
a
mocking
echo
you
sit
here
in
this
tomb
and
when
somebody
tells
you
that
the
world
you
know
has
died
you
refuse
to
believe
it
even
though
every
night
after
you
sneak
home
and
huddle
up
inside
your
room
trying
not
to
be
noticed
ten
guards
patrol
this
place
with
subatomics
so
the
yardstick
gangs
wo
break
in
and
take
over
so
they
wo
do
what
they
did
down
south
overrun
the
office
buildings
and
the
factories
and
break
them
up
cut
them
down
to
size
for
living
quarters
but
they
were
stopped
eric
objected
i
saw
it
on
the
telescreen
the
security
forces
stopped
them
crapola
wolzek
pronounced
the
archaicism
with
studied
care
you
saw
films
faked
films
have
you
ever
traveled
eric
ever
been
down
south
and
seen
conditions
there
nobody
travels
nowadays
you
know
that
priorities
i
travel
eric
and
i
know
security
forces
do
suppress
anything
in
the
south
these
days
because
they
made
up
of
yardsticks
now
that
right
yardsticks
exclusively
and
in
a
few
years
that
the
way
it
will
be
up
here
did
you
ever
hear
about
the
chicagee
riots
you
mean
last
year
when
the
yardsticks
tried
to
take
over
the
synthetic
plants
at
the
stockyards
tried
they
the
workers
ousted
management
over
fifty
thousand
were
killed
in
the
revolution
oh
do
look
so
shocked
that
the
right
word
for
it
but
the
yardsticks
won
out
in
the
end
but
the
telescreen
showed
damn
the
telescreen
i
know
because
i
happened
to
be
there
when
it
happened
and
if
had
been
there
you
and
a
few
million
other
ostriches
who
sit
with
your
heads
buried
in
telescreens
maybe
we
could
have
stopped
them
i
do
believe
it
i
ca
all
right
think
back
that
was
last
year
and
since
the
first
of
this
year
what
happened
to
the
standard
size
they
cut
it
in
half
eric
admitted
but
that
because
of
ag
shortages
according
to
the
telescreen
reports
he
stood
up
gulping
look
here
i
not
going
to
listen
to
any
more
of
this
kind
of
talk
by
rights
i
ought
to
turn
your
name
in
go
ahead
wolzek
waved
his
hand
it
happened
before
i
was
reported
when
i
blasted
the
yardsticks
who
shot
my
father
down
when
he
tried
to
land
his
jet
in
a
southern
field
i
was
reported
when
they
killed
annette
annette
you
remember
that
name
do
you
eric
your
first
girl
was
she
well
i
the
guy
who
married
her
yes
and
i
the
guy
who
talked
her
into
having
a
baby
without
the
benefit
of
leff
shots
sure
illegal
and
only
a
few
of
us
ever
try
it
any
more
but
we
both
agreed
that
we
wanted
it
that
way
a
real
normal
baby
or
abnormal
according
to
the
yardsticks
and
the
stupid
government
it
was
a
dirty
scum
of
a
government
doctor
who
let
her
die
on
the
table
when
he
discovered
the
child
weighed
seven
pounds
that
when
i
really
woke
up
eric
that
when
i
knew
there
was
going
to
be
only
one
decision
to
make
in
the
future
kill
or
be
killed
annette
she
died
you
say
wolzek
moved
over
and
put
his
hand
on
eric
shoulder
you
never
married
did
you
eric
i
think
i
know
why
it
because
you
felt
the
way
i
did
about
it
you
wanted
a
regular
kid
not
a
yardstick
only
you
did
quite
have
the
guts
to
try
and
beat
the
law
well
need
guts
now
because
it
getting
to
the
point
where
the
law
protect
you
any
more
the
government
is
made
up
of
old
men
and
they
afraid
to
take
action
in
a
few
years
they
be
pushed
out
of
office
all
over
the
world
we
have
yardstick
government
then
all
the
way
and
yardstick
law
and
that
means
they
cut
us
down
to
size
but
what
can
you
we
do
about
it
plenty
there
still
a
little
time
if
we
naturalists
can
only
get
together
stop
being
just
a
name
and
become
an
organized
force
maybe
the
ending
will
be
different
we
got
to
try
in
any
case
the
yardsticks
are
human
beings
just
like
us
eric
said
slowly
we
ca
just
declare
war
on
them
wipe
them
out
it
not
their
they
were
born
that
way
wolzek
nodded
i
know
nothing
is
anybody
fault
really
this
whole
business
began
in
good
faith
leffingwell
and
some
of
the
other
geniuses
saw
a
problem
and
offered
what
they
sincerely
believed
was
a
solution
but
it
did
work
eric
murmured
wrong
it
worked
only
too
well
that
the
trouble
sure
we
eliminated
our
difficulties
on
the
physical
level
in
less
than
thirty
years
we
reached
a
point
where
there
no
longer
any
danger
of
overcrowding
or
starvation
but
the
psychological
factor
is
something
we
ca
cope
with
we
thought
we
ended
war
and
the
possibilities
of
war
a
long
time
ago
but
it
is
foreign
enemies
we
must
fear
today
we
created
a
nation
divided
into
davids
and
goliaths
and
david
and
goliath
are
always
enemies
david
killed
goliath
eric
said
does
that
mean
we
going
to
die
only
if
we
as
stupid
as
goliath
was
only
if
we
wear
our
telescreens
like
invincible
armor
and
pay
no
attention
to
the
slingshot
in
david
hands
eric
lit
a
reef
all
right
he
said
you
do
have
to
lecture
willing
to
join
but
i
no
goliath
really
i
never
had
a
fight
in
my
life
what
could
i
do
to
help
you
a
rental
agent
you
have
the
keys
to
this
building
the
guards
do
bother
you
by
day
do
they
you
come
and
go
as
you
please
that
means
you
can
get
into
the
cellars
you
can
help
us
move
the
stuff
down
there
and
we
take
care
of
the
guards
some
night
after
that
i
do
understand
the
friendly
pressure
on
eric
shoulder
became
a
fierce
grip
you
do
have
to
understand
all
you
do
is
let
us
plant
the
stuff
in
the
cellars
and
let
us
get
rid
of
the
guards
afterwards
in
our
own
way
the
yardsticks
will
do
the
rest
you
mean
take
over
the
building
when
it
not
protected
of
course
they
take
it
over
completely
once
they
see
there
no
opposition
and
they
remodel
it
to
suit
themselves
and
within
a
month
there
be
ten
thousand
yardsticks
sitting
in
this
place
the
government
will
never
stand
still
for
that
wake
up
it
happening
all
over
all
the
time
and
nothing
is
being
done
to
prevent
it
security
is
too
weak
and
officials
are
too
timid
to
risk
open
warfare
so
the
yardsticks
win
and
i
going
to
see
that
they
win
this
place
but
how
will
that
help
us
you
do
see
it
yet
do
you
and
neither
will
the
yardsticks
until
some
fine
day
three
or
four
months
from
now
we
get
around
to
what
will
be
planted
in
the
cellars
somebody
will
throw
a
switch
miles
away
and
boom
wolzek
you
could
it
coming
not
only
here
but
in
fifty
other
places
we
got
to
fight
fire
with
fire
eric
it
our
only
chance
bring
this
thing
out
into
the
open
make
the
government
realize
this
is
war
civil
war
that
the
only
way
to
force
them
to
take
real
action
we
ca
do
it
any
other
way
it
illegal
to
organize
politically
and
petitions
do
no
good
we
ca
get
a
hearing
well
they
have
to
listen
to
the
explosions
i
just
do
know
maybe
you
the
one
who
should
have
married
annette
after
all
wolzek
voice
was
cold
maybe
you
could
have
watched
her
watched
her
scream
and
beg
and
die
and
never
wanted
to
move
a
muscle
to
do
anything
about
it
afterwards
maybe
you
the
model
citizen
eric
you
and
the
thousands
of
others
who
are
standing
by
and
letting
the
yardsticks
chop
us
down
one
by
one
they
say
in
nature
it
the
survival
of
the
fittest
well
perhaps
you
not
fit
to
survive
eric
was
listening
she
screamed
he
said
you
heard
her
scream
wolzek
nodded
i
can
still
hear
her
i
always
hear
her
yes
eric
blinked
abruptly
when
do
we
start
wolzek
smiled
at
him
it
was
a
pretty
good
smile
for
a
man
who
can
always
hear
screaming
i
knew
i
could
count
on
you
he
murmured
nothing
like
old
friends
funny
is
it
eric
tried
to
match
his
smile
the
way
things
work
out
you
and
i
being
kids
together
you
marrying
my
girl
and
then
us
meeting
up
again
this
way
yes
said
wolzek
and
he
was
smiling
now
i
guess
it
a
small
world
harry
collins
harry
son
house
was
on
the
outskirts
of
washington
near
what
had
once
been
called
gettysburg
harry
was
surprised
to
find
that
it
a
house
and
a
rather
large
one
despite
the
fact
that
almost
all
the
furniture
had
been
scaled
down
proportionately
to
fit
the
needs
of
a
man
three
feet
high
but
then
harry
was
growing
accustomed
to
surprises
he
found
a
room
of
his
own
ready
and
waiting
on
the
second
floor
here
the
furniture
was
of
almost
antique
vintage
but
adequate
in
size
and
here
in
an
atmosphere
of
unaccustomed
comfort
he
could
talk
so
you
a
physician
eh
harry
gazed
down
into
the
diminutive
face
striving
to
accept
the
fact
that
he
was
speaking
to
a
mature
adult
his
own
son
his
and
sue
a
grown
man
and
a
doctor
it
seemed
incredible
but
then
nothing
was
more
incredible
than
the
knowledge
that
he
was
actually
here
in
his
child
home
we
all
specialists
in
one
field
or
another
his
son
explained
every
one
of
us
born
and
surviving
during
the
early
experimental
period
received
our
schooling
under
a
plan
leffingwell
set
up
it
was
part
of
his
conditional
agreement
that
we
become
wards
of
the
state
he
knew
the
time
might
come
when
we
be
needed
but
why
was
all
this
done
openly
you
know
the
answer
to
that
there
was
no
way
of
educating
us
under
the
prevailing
system
and
there
was
always
a
danger
we
might
be
singled
out
as
freaks
who
must
be
destroyed
particularly
in
those
early
years
so
leffingwell
relied
on
secrecy
just
as
he
did
during
his
experimentation
period
you
know
how
felt
about
that
you
believed
innocent
people
were
being
murdered
would
you
have
listened
to
his
explanations
accepted
the
fact
that
his
work
was
worth
the
cost
of
a
few
lives
so
that
future
billions
of
human
beings
might
be
saved
no
there
was
no
time
for
explanation
or
indoctrination
leffingwell
chose
concealment
yes
harry
sighed
i
understand
that
better
now
i
think
but
i
could
see
it
then
when
i
tried
to
kill
him
he
flushed
and
i
still
ca
quite
comprehend
why
he
spared
me
after
that
attempt
because
he
was
the
monster
you
thought
him
to
be
when
i
pleaded
with
him
were
the
one
harry
son
turned
away
yes
when
i
was
told
who
you
really
were
i
went
to
him
but
i
was
only
a
child
remember
that
and
he
spare
you
out
of
sentimentality
he
had
a
purpose
a
purpose
in
sending
me
to
prison
letting
me
rot
all
these
years
while
while
i
grew
up
i
and
the
others
like
myself
and
while
the
world
outside
changed
harry
son
smiled
your
friend
richard
wade
was
right
you
know
he
guessed
a
great
deal
of
the
truth
leffingwell
and
manschoff
and
the
rest
of
their
associates
deliberately
set
out
to
assemble
a
select
group
of
nonconformists
men
of
specialized
talents
and
outlooks
there
were
over
three
hundred
of
you
at
stark
falls
richard
wade
knew
why
and
so
he
was
dragged
off
and
murdered
murdered
no
father
he
very
much
alive
i
assure
you
in
fact
he
be
here
tonight
but
why
was
he
taken
away
so
abruptly
without
any
warning
he
was
needed
there
was
a
crisis
when
leffingwell
died
harry
son
sighed
you
did
know
about
that
did
you
there
so
much
for
you
to
learn
but
i
let
him
tell
you
himself
when
you
see
him
this
evening
richard
wade
told
him
and
so
did
william
chang
and
lars
neilstrom
and
all
the
others
during
the
ensuing
weeks
harry
saw
each
of
them
again
but
wade
explanation
was
sufficient
i
was
right
he
said
there
was
no
underground
when
we
were
at
stark
falls
what
i
did
realize
though
was
that
there
was
an
overground
overground
you
might
call
it
that
leffingwell
and
his
staff
formed
the
nucleus
they
foresaw
the
social
crisis
which
lay
ahead
when
the
world
became
physically
divided
into
the
tall
and
the
short
the
young
and
the
old
they
knew
there
be
a
need
of
individuality
then
and
they
create
a
stockpile
a
stockpile
of
the
younger
generation
specially
educated
a
stockpile
of
the
older
generation
carefully
selected
we
conspicuous
rebels
were
incarcerated
and
given
an
opportunity
to
think
the
problem
through
with
limited
contact
with
one
viewpoints
but
why
were
we
told
the
truth
at
the
beginning
allowed
to
meet
and
make
some
sensible
plans
for
the
future
harry
son
interrupted
because
leffingwell
realized
this
would
defeat
the
ultimate
purpose
you
have
formed
your
own
as
prisoners
dedicated
to
your
own
welfare
there
be
emotional
ties
i
still
do
know
what
you
talking
about
what
are
we
supposed
to
prepare
for
now
richard
wade
shrugged
leffingwell
had
it
all
planned
he
foresaw
that
when
the
first
generation
of
yardsticks
that
what
they
call
themselves
you
know
came
of
age
there
be
social
unrest
the
young
people
would
want
to
take
over
and
the
older
generation
would
try
to
remain
in
positions
of
power
it
was
his
belief
that
tensions
could
be
alleviated
only
by
proper
leadership
on
both
sides
he
himself
had
an
important
voice
in
government
circles
he
set
up
an
arrangement
whereby
a
certain
number
of
posts
would
be
assigned
to
people
of
his
choice
both
young
and
old
similarly
in
the
various
professions
there
be
room
for
appointees
he
select
given
a
year
or
two
of
training
leffingwell
felt
that
we
be
ready
for
these
positions
young
men
like
your
son
would
be
placed
in
key
spots
where
their
influence
would
be
helpful
with
the
yardsticks
older
men
such
as
yourself
would
go
into
other
assignments
in
communications
media
chiefly
the
skillful
use
of
techniques
could
avert
open
clashes
he
predicted
a
lasting
about
twenty
years
roughly
from
to
once
we
weathered
that
span
equilibrium
would
be
regained
as
a
second
and
third
generation
came
along
and
the
elders
became
a
small
minority
if
we
did
our
work
well
and
eliminated
the
sources
of
prejudice
friction
and
hostility
the
transition
could
be
made
the
overground
in
governmental
circles
would
finance
us
this
was
leffingwell
plan
his
dream
you
speak
in
the
past
tense
harry
said
yes
wade
voice
was
harsh
because
leffingwell
is
dead
of
cerebral
hemorrhage
and
his
plan
died
with
him
oh
we
still
have
some
connections
in
government
enough
to
get
men
like
yourself
out
of
stark
falls
but
things
have
moved
too
swiftly
the
yardsticks
are
already
on
the
march
the
people
in
power
even
those
we
relied
upon
are
getting
frightened
they
ca
see
that
there
time
left
to
train
us
to
take
over
and
frankly
i
afraid
most
of
them
have
no
inclination
to
give
up
their
present
power
they
intend
to
use
force
but
you
talk
as
though
the
yardsticks
were
united
they
are
uniting
and
swiftly
remember
the
naturalists
harry
nodded
slowly
i
was
one
once
or
thought
i
was
you
were
a
liberal
i
talking
about
the
naturalists
the
ones
bent
on
actual
revolution
revolution
that
the
word
and
that
the
situation
it
coming
to
a
head
fast
and
how
will
we
prevent
it
i
do
know
harry
son
stared
up
at
him
most
of
us
believe
too
late
to
prevent
it
our
immediate
problem
will
be
survival
the
naturalists
want
control
for
themselves
the
yardsticks
intend
to
destroy
the
power
of
the
older
generation
and
we
feel
that
if
matters
come
to
a
head
soon
the
government
itself
may
turn
on
us
too
they
have
to
in
other
words
said
harry
we
stand
alone
fall
alone
more
likely
wade
corrected
how
many
of
us
are
there
about
six
hundred
said
harry
son
located
in
private
homes
throughout
this
eastern
area
if
there
violence
we
do
have
a
chance
of
controlling
the
situation
but
we
can
survive
as
i
see
it
that
our
only
salvation
at
the
moment
to
somehow
survive
the
coming
conflict
then
perhaps
we
can
find
a
way
to
function
as
leffingwell
planned
we
never
survive
here
they
use
every
conceivable
weapon
but
since
there
no
open
break
with
the
government
yet
we
could
still
presumably
arrange
for
transportation
facilities
to
where
some
spot
in
which
we
could
weather
the
storm
what
about
leffingwell
old
hideout
the
units
are
still
standing
harry
son
nodded
yes
that
a
possibility
but
what
about
food
grizek
what
friend
of
mine
harry
told
him
look
we
going
to
have
to
work
fast
and
yet
we
got
to
do
it
in
a
way
that
wo
attract
any
attention
not
even
from
the
government
i
suggest
we
set
up
an
organizing
committee
and
make
plans
he
frowned
how
much
time
do
you
think
we
have
a
year
or
so
six
months
his
son
hazarded
four
at
most
wade
said
have
you
been
getting
the
full
reports
on
those
riots
pretty
soon
they
declare
a
state
of
national
emergency
and
then
nobody
will
be
going
anywhere
all
right
harry
collins
grinned
we
do
it
in
four
months
actually
as
it
worked
out
they
did
it
in
just
a
day
or
so
under
three
five
hundred
and
men
moved
by
jetter
to
colorado
springs
thence
by
helicopter
to
the
canyon
hideaway
they
moved
in
small
groups
a
few
each
week
harry
himself
had
already
established
the
liaison
system
and
he
was
based
at
grizek
ranch
grizek
was
dead
but
bassett
and
tom
lowery
remained
and
they
cooperated
food
would
be
ready
for
the
that
came
out
of
the
canyon
the
canyon
installation
itself
was
deserted
and
the
only
problem
it
presented
was
one
of
rehabilitation
the
first
contingent
took
over
the
jetters
carried
more
than
their
human
cargo
they
were
filled
with
equipment
of
all
sorts
microscans
and
laboratory
instruments
and
devices
for
communication
by
the
time
the
entire
group
was
assembled
they
had
the
necessary
implementation
for
study
and
research
it
was
a
and
operation
to
his
surprise
harry
found
himself
acting
as
the
leader
of
the
expedition
and
he
continued
in
this
capacity
after
they
were
established
the
irony
of
the
situation
did
not
escape
him
to
all
intents
and
purposes
he
was
now
ruling
the
very
domain
in
which
he
had
once
languished
as
a
prisoner
but
with
wade
and
chang
and
the
others
he
set
up
a
provisional
system
which
worked
out
very
well
and
proved
very
helpful
once
the
news
reached
them
that
open
revolt
had
begun
in
the
world
outside
a
battered
landed
one
evening
at
dusk
and
the
wounded
pilot
poured
out
his
message
then
his
life
blood
angelisco
was
gone
washington
was
gone
the
naturalists
had
struck
using
the
old
outlawed
weapons
and
it
was
the
same
abroad
according
to
the
few
garbled
reports
thereafter
obtainable
only
ancient
shortwave
devices
from
then
on
nobody
left
the
canyon
except
on
weekly
to
the
ranch
grazing
lands
for
fresh
supplies
fortunately
that
area
was
undisturbed
and
so
were
its
laconic
occupants
they
neither
knew
nor
cared
what
went
on
in
the
world
outside
what
cities
were
reported
destroyed
what
forces
triumphed
or
went
down
into
defeat
what
activity
or
radioactivity
prevailed
life
in
the
canyon
flowed
on
more
peacefully
than
the
river
cleaving
its
center
there
was
much
to
do
and
much
to
learn
it
was
actually
a
monastic
existence
compounded
of
frugality
abstinence
continence
and
devotion
to
scholarly
pursuits
within
a
year
gardens
flourished
within
two
years
herds
grazed
the
grassy
slopes
within
three
years
cloth
was
being
woven
on
looms
in
the
ancient
way
and
most
of
the
homespun
arts
of
an
agrarian
society
had
been
revived
men
fell
sick
and
men
died
but
the
survivors
lived
in
amity
harry
collins
celebrated
his
sixtieth
birthday
as
the
equivalent
of
a
student
of
medicine
his
instructor
being
his
own
son
everyone
was
studying
some
subject
acquiring
some
new
skill
rebellious
natures
and
biological
oddities
alike
were
united
by
the
common
bond
of
intellectual
curiosity
it
was
however
no
utopia
some
of
the
younger
men
wanted
women
and
there
were
no
women
some
were
irked
by
confinement
and
wandered
off
three
of
the
fleet
of
eleven
were
stolen
by
groups
of
malcontents
from
time
to
time
there
would
be
a
serious
quarrel
six
men
were
murdered
the
population
dwindled
to
four
hundred
and
twenty
but
there
was
progress
in
the
main
eventually
banning
joined
the
group
from
the
ranch
and
under
his
guidance
the
was
formalized
attempts
were
made
to
project
the
future
situation
to
prepare
for
the
day
when
it
would
be
possible
to
venture
safely
into
the
outside
world
once
again
and
utilize
abilities
nobody
could
predict
when
that
would
be
nor
what
kind
of
world
would
await
their
coming
by
the
time
the
fifth
year
had
passed
even
shortwave
reports
had
long
since
ceased
rumors
persisted
that
radioactive
contamination
was
widespread
that
the
population
had
been
virtually
decimated
that
the
government
had
fallen
that
the
naturalists
had
set
up
their
own
reign
only
to
fall
victim
to
internal
strife
but
one
thing
is
certain
harry
collins
told
his
companions
as
they
assembled
in
the
usual
monthly
meeting
on
the
grounds
before
the
old
headquarters
building
one
afternoon
in
july
the
fighting
will
end
soon
if
we
hear
nothing
more
within
the
next
few
months
we
send
out
observation
parties
once
we
determine
the
exact
situation
we
can
plan
accordingly
the
world
is
going
to
need
what
we
can
give
it
will
use
what
we
have
learned
it
will
accept
our
aid
one
of
these
days
and
he
went
on
to
outline
a
program
of
making
contact
with
the
powers
that
be
or
might
be
it
sounded
logical
and
even
the
chronic
grumblers
and
habitual
pessimists
in
the
group
were
encouraged
if
at
times
they
felt
the
situation
fantastic
and
the
hope
forlorn
they
were
heartened
now
richard
wade
summed
it
up
succinctly
afterwards
in
a
private
conversation
with
harry
it
is
going
to
be
easy
he
said
in
the
old
science
fiction
yarns
i
used
to
write
a
group
like
this
would
have
been
able
to
prevent
the
revolution
at
the
very
least
it
would
decide
who
won
if
fighting
actually
broke
out
but
in
reality
we
were
too
late
to
forestall
revolt
and
we
could
win
the
war
no
matter
on
whose
side
we
fought
there
just
one
job
we
equipped
for
and
that
to
win
the
peace
i
do
mean
we
step
out
of
here
and
take
over
the
world
either
we
have
to
move
slowly
and
cautiously
dispersing
in
little
groups
of
five
or
six
all
over
the
country
and
we
have
to
sound
out
men
in
the
communities
we
go
to
find
those
who
are
willing
to
learn
and
willing
to
build
but
we
can
be
an
influence
and
an
important
one
we
have
the
knowledge
and
the
skill
we
may
not
be
chosen
to
lead
but
we
can
the
leaders
and
that
important
harry
smiled
in
agreement
they
have
something
to
offer
and
surely
it
would
be
recognized
even
if
the
naturalists
had
won
even
if
the
entire
country
had
sunk
into
no
use
anticipating
such
problems
now
wait
until
fall
came
then
reconnoitre
and
find
out
wait
until
fall
it
was
a
wise
decision
but
one
which
ignored
a
single
important
fact
the
naturalists
did
wait
until
fall
to
conduct
their
reconnaissance
they
came
over
the
canyon
that
very
night
a
large
group
of
them
in
a
large
jetter
and
they
dropped
a
large
bomb
jesse
pringle
they
were
after
him
the
whole
world
was
in
flames
and
the
buildings
were
falling
the
mighty
were
fallen
the
day
of
judgment
was
at
hand
he
ran
through
the
flames
blindly
blind
samson
eyeless
in
gaza
treading
at
the
mill
the
mills
of
the
gods
grind
slowly
but
they
grind
exceedingly
small
small
they
were
all
small
but
that
did
matter
they
had
the
guns
and
they
were
hunting
him
down
to
his
doom
day
of
doom
doomsday
the
great
red
dragon
with
seven
heads
and
ten
horns
was
abroad
in
the
land
they
had
unleashed
the
dragon
and
his
breath
was
a
fire
that
seared
and
his
tail
was
a
thunder
that
toppled
towers
the
dragon
was
searching
him
out
for
his
sins
he
would
be
captured
and
set
to
labor
in
the
mill
but
he
would
escape
he
must
escape
he
was
afraid
of
them
small
as
they
were
and
great
oaks
from
little
acorns
grow
it
the
little
things
that
count
and
he
dare
not
go
for
fear
of
little
men
jesse
crouched
against
the
dock
watching
the
burn
the
whole
city
was
burning
babylon
the
mighty
the
whole
world
was
burning
in
god
final
wrath
of
judgment
nobody
believed
in
god
any
more
nobody
read
the
bible
and
that
why
they
did
know
these
things
jesse
knew
because
he
was
an
old
man
and
he
remembered
how
it
had
been
when
he
was
a
little
boy
a
little
boy
who
learned
of
the
word
of
god
and
the
wrath
of
god
he
could
see
the
reflection
of
the
flames
in
the
water
now
and
the
reflection
was
shimmery
and
broken
because
of
the
black
clusters
floating
past
large
clusters
and
small
clusters
there
were
bodies
in
the
water
the
bodies
of
the
slain
thunder
boomed
from
the
city
behind
him
explosions
that
how
it
had
started
when
the
naturalists
began
blowing
up
the
buildings
and
then
the
yardsticks
had
come
with
their
weapons
hunting
down
the
naturalists
or
had
it
been
that
way
really
it
did
matter
now
that
was
in
another
country
and
besides
the
wench
was
dead
the
wench
dead
his
wench
jesse
wench
she
was
so
old
only
but
they
killed
her
they
blew
off
the
top
of
her
head
and
he
could
feel
it
when
they
did
it
was
as
if
something
had
happened
in
head
and
then
he
ran
at
them
and
screamed
and
there
was
great
slaughter
amongst
the
heathen
the
forces
of
unrighteousness
and
jesse
had
fled
and
smote
evil
in
the
name
of
the
lord
for
he
perceived
now
that
the
time
was
at
hand
the
mighty
are
jesse
blinked
at
the
water
wishing
it
would
clear
wishing
his
thoughts
would
clear
sometimes
for
a
moment
he
could
remember
back
to
the
way
things
were
when
it
was
still
a
real
world
with
real
people
in
it
when
he
was
just
a
little
boy
and
everybody
else
was
big
strange
now
he
was
an
old
man
a
big
old
man
and
almost
everybody
else
was
little
he
tried
to
think
what
it
had
been
like
so
long
ago
it
was
too
long
all
he
could
remember
about
being
small
was
that
he
had
been
afraid
afraid
of
the
bigger
people
and
now
he
was
big
and
afraid
of
the
smaller
people
of
course
they
were
real
it
was
just
part
of
the
prophecy
they
were
the
locusts
sent
to
consume
and
destroy
he
kept
telling
himself
there
was
nothing
to
fear
the
righteous
need
not
fear
when
the
day
of
judgment
is
at
hand
only
somewhere
inside
of
him
was
this
little
boy
crying
mama
mama
mama
and
somewhere
else
was
this
old
man
just
staring
down
into
the
water
and
waiting
for
them
to
find
him
another
explosion
sounded
this
one
was
closer
they
must
be
bombing
the
entire
city
or
else
it
was
the
dragon
lashing
his
tail
somebody
ran
past
jesse
carrying
a
torch
no
it
was
a
torch
his
hair
was
on
fire
he
jumped
into
the
water
screaming
coming
they
coming
jesse
turned
and
blinked
they
were
coming
all
right
he
could
see
them
pouring
out
of
the
alleyway
like
rats
rats
with
gleaming
eyes
gleaming
claws
suddenly
his
head
cleared
he
realized
that
he
was
going
to
die
he
had
perhaps
one
minute
of
life
left
one
minute
out
of
eighty
years
and
he
could
fool
himself
any
longer
he
was
not
delirious
day
of
judgment
that
was
nonsense
and
there
was
no
dragon
and
these
were
not
rats
they
were
merely
men
puny
little
men
who
killed
because
they
were
afraid
jesse
was
a
big
man
but
he
was
afraid
too
six
feet
three
inches
tall
he
was
when
he
stood
up
straight
as
he
did
now
watching
them
come
but
he
knew
fear
and
he
resolved
that
he
must
not
take
that
fear
with
him
into
death
he
wanted
to
die
with
something
better
than
that
was
there
something
he
could
find
and
cling
to
perhaps
some
memory
a
minute
is
so
short
and
eighty
years
is
so
long
jesse
stood
there
swaying
watching
them
draw
nearer
watching
them
as
they
caught
sight
of
him
and
raised
their
weapons
he
scanned
rapidly
into
the
past
into
the
past
before
the
time
the
wench
was
dead
back
to
when
you
and
i
were
young
maggie
back
still
earlier
and
earlier
seeking
the
high
point
the
high
school
that
was
it
the
high
school
the
highlight
the
moment
of
triumph
the
game
with
lincoln
yes
that
was
it
he
had
been
ashamed
of
being
six
feet
three
inches
then
he
been
proud
of
it
proud
as
he
raised
his
arms
and
down
into
the
water
as
the
bullets
and
that
was
the
end
of
jesse
pringle
jesse
pringle
champion
basketball
center
of
the
class
of
littlejohn
the
helicopter
landed
on
the
roof
and
the
attendants
wheeled
it
over
to
one
side
they
propped
the
ladder
up
and
littlejohn
descended
slowly
panting
they
had
a
coasterchair
waiting
and
he
sank
into
it
grateful
for
the
rest
hardy
fellows
these
attendants
but
then
they
were
almost
three
feet
tall
more
stamina
that
was
the
secret
common
stock
of
course
but
they
served
a
purpose
somebody
had
to
carry
out
orders
when
they
wheeled
the
coasterchair
into
the
elevator
littlejohn
descended
the
elevator
halted
on
the
first
floor
and
he
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
great
heights
always
made
him
faint
and
dizzy
and
even
a
short
helicopter
trip
took
its
toll
the
mere
thought
of
soaring
two
hundred
feet
above
the
ground
was
enough
to
paralyze
him
but
this
journey
was
vital
thurmon
was
waiting
for
him
yes
thurmon
was
waiting
for
him
here
in
the
council
chamber
the
coasterchair
rolled
forward
into
the
room
and
again
littlejohn
felt
a
twinge
of
apprehension
the
room
was
vast
too
big
for
comfort
it
must
be
all
of
fifty
feet
long
and
over
ten
feet
in
height
how
could
thurmon
stand
it
working
here
but
he
had
to
endure
it
littlejohn
reminded
himself
he
was
head
of
the
council
thurmon
was
lying
on
the
couch
when
littlejohn
rolled
in
but
he
sat
up
and
smiled
i
greet
you
he
said
i
greet
you
littlejohn
answered
no
do
bother
to
stay
seated
surely
we
do
need
to
be
ceremonious
thurmon
pricked
up
his
ears
at
the
sound
of
the
unfamiliar
word
he
was
the
scholarly
type
like
littlejohn
but
he
appreciated
littlejohn
learning
and
knew
he
was
important
to
the
council
they
needed
scholars
these
days
and
antiquarians
too
one
has
to
look
to
the
past
when
rebuilding
a
world
you
sent
for
me
littlejohn
asked
the
question
was
purely
rhetorical
but
he
wanted
to
break
the
silence
thurmon
looked
troubled
as
he
replied
yes
it
is
a
matter
of
confidence
between
us
so
be
it
you
may
speak
in
trust
thurmon
eyed
the
door
come
nearer
he
said
littlejohn
pressed
a
lever
and
rolled
up
to
the
couchside
eyes
peered
at
him
through
the
thick
contact
lenses
littlejohn
noted
the
deep
wrinkles
around
his
mouth
but
without
surprise
after
all
thurmon
was
an
old
man
he
must
be
over
thirty
i
have
been
thinking
thurmon
said
abruptly
we
have
failed
failed
thurmon
nodded
need
i
explain
you
have
been
close
to
the
council
for
many
years
you
have
seen
what
we
attempted
ever
since
the
close
of
the
naturalist
wars
a
magnificent
effort
littlejohn
answered
politely
in
less
than
thirty
years
an
entire
new
world
has
risen
from
the
ruins
of
the
old
civilization
has
been
restored
snatched
from
the
very
brink
of
a
barbarism
that
threatened
to
engulf
us
nonsense
thurmon
murmured
what
sheer
nonsense
littlejohn
you
talking
like
a
pedant
but
i
a
pedant
littlejohn
nodded
and
it
true
when
the
naturalists
were
exterminated
this
nation
and
other
nations
were
literally
destroyed
worse
than
physical
destruction
was
the
threat
of
mental
and
moral
collapse
but
the
yardstick
councils
arose
to
take
over
the
concept
of
small
government
came
into
being
and
saved
us
we
began
to
rebuild
on
a
sensible
scale
with
local
limited
control
the
little
community
arose
spare
me
the
history
lesson
said
thurmon
dryly
we
rebuilt
yes
we
survived
in
a
sense
perhaps
we
even
made
certain
advances
there
is
no
longer
any
economic
rivalry
no
social
distinctions
no
external
pressure
i
think
i
can
safely
assume
that
the
danger
of
future
warfare
is
forever
banished
the
balance
of
power
is
no
longer
a
factor
the
balance
of
nature
has
been
partially
restored
and
only
one
problem
remains
to
plague
mankind
what
is
that
we
face
extinction
thurmon
said
but
that
not
true
littlejohn
interrupted
look
at
history
and
look
at
us
thurmon
sighed
you
need
bother
with
history
the
answer
is
written
in
our
faces
in
our
own
bodies
i
searched
the
past
very
little
compared
to
your
scholarship
but
enough
to
know
that
things
were
different
in
the
old
days
the
naturalists
whatever
else
they
might
have
been
were
strong
men
they
walked
freely
in
the
land
they
lived
lustily
and
long
do
you
know
what
our
average
is
today
littlejohn
a
shade
under
forty
years
and
that
only
if
one
is
fortunate
enough
to
lead
a
sheltered
existence
as
we
do
in
the
mines
in
the
fields
in
the
radioactive
areas
they
die
before
the
age
of
thirty
littlejohn
leaned
forward
schuyler
touches
on
just
that
point
in
his
of
he
said
eagerly
he
posits
the
relationship
between
size
and
duration
time
is
relative
you
know
our
lives
short
as
they
may
be
in
terms
of
comparative
chronology
nevertheless
have
a
subjective
span
equal
to
that
of
the
naturalists
in
their
heyday
nonsense
thurman
said
again
did
you
think
that
is
what
concerns
me
whether
or
not
we
feel
that
our
lives
are
long
or
short
what
then
i
talking
about
the
basic
elements
essential
to
survival
talking
about
strength
stamina
endurance
the
ability
to
function
that
what
we
losing
along
with
the
normal
span
of
years
the
world
is
soft
and
flabby
yardstick
children
they
tell
us
were
healthy
at
first
but
children
are
weaker
and
their
grandchildren
weaker
still
the
effect
of
the
wars
the
ravages
of
radiation
and
malnutrition
have
taken
a
terrible
toll
the
world
is
soft
and
flabby
today
people
ca
walk
any
more
let
alone
run
we
find
it
difficult
to
lift
and
bend
and
work
but
we
wo
have
to
worry
about
such
matters
for
long
littlejohn
hazarded
think
of
what
being
done
in
robotics
those
recent
experiments
seem
to
prove
i
know
thurmon
nodded
we
can
create
robots
no
doubt
we
have
a
limited
amount
of
raw
materials
to
allocate
to
the
project
and
if
we
can
perfect
automatons
they
function
quite
adequately
virtually
indestructible
too
i
understand
i
imagine
they
still
be
able
to
operate
efficiently
a
hundred
or
more
years
from
now
if
only
they
learn
to
oil
and
repair
one
another
because
by
that
time
the
human
race
will
be
gone
come
now
it
is
that
serious
oh
but
it
is
thurmon
raised
himself
again
with
an
effort
your
study
of
history
should
have
taught
you
one
thing
if
nothing
else
the
tempo
is
quickening
while
it
took
mankind
thousands
of
years
to
move
from
the
bow
and
arrow
to
the
rifle
it
took
only
a
few
hundred
to
move
from
the
rifle
to
the
thermonuclear
weapon
it
took
ages
before
men
mastered
flight
and
then
in
two
generations
they
developed
satellites
in
three
they
reached
the
moon
and
mars
but
we
talking
about
development
i
know
and
physically
the
human
race
altered
just
as
drastically
in
an
equally
short
span
of
time
as
recently
as
the
nineteenth
century
the
incidence
of
disease
was
a
thousandfold
greater
than
it
is
now
life
was
short
then
in
the
twentieth
century
disease
lessened
and
doubled
in
certain
areas
height
and
weight
increased
perceptibly
with
every
passing
decade
then
came
leffingwell
and
his
injections
height
weight
have
fallen
perceptibly
every
decade
since
then
the
war
merely
hastened
the
process
you
appear
to
have
devoted
a
great
deal
of
time
to
this
question
littlejohn
observed
i
have
answered
the
older
man
and
it
is
not
a
question
it
is
a
fact
the
one
fact
that
confronts
us
all
if
we
proceed
along
our
present
path
we
face
certain
extinction
in
a
very
short
time
the
strain
is
weakening
constantly
the
vitality
is
draining
away
we
sought
to
defeat
nature
but
the
naturalists
were
right
in
their
way
and
the
solution
thurmon
was
silent
for
a
long
moment
then
i
have
none
he
said
you
have
consulted
the
medical
authorities
naturally
and
experiments
have
been
made
physical
conditioning
systems
of
exercise
experimentation
in
chemotherapy
are
still
being
undertaken
there
no
lack
of
volunteers
but
a
great
lack
of
results
no
the
answer
does
not
lie
in
that
direction
but
what
else
is
there
that
is
what
i
had
hoped
you
might
tell
me
thurmon
said
you
are
a
scholar
you
know
the
past
you
speak
often
of
the
lessons
of
history
littlejohn
was
nodding
but
not
in
agreement
he
was
trying
to
comprehend
for
suddenly
the
conviction
came
to
him
clearly
thurmon
was
right
it
was
happening
had
happened
right
under
their
smug
noses
the
world
was
weakening
it
was
slowing
down
and
the
race
is
only
to
the
swift
he
cursed
himself
for
his
habit
of
thinking
in
platitudes
and
quotations
but
long
years
of
study
had
unfitted
him
for
less
prosaic
phraseology
if
he
could
only
be
practical
thurmon
he
said
there
is
a
way
a
way
so
obvious
we
all
overlooked
it
passed
right
over
it
and
that
is
stop
the
leffingwell
injections
but
i
know
what
you
say
there
have
been
genetic
mutations
very
true
but
such
mutations
ca
be
universal
a
certain
percentage
of
offspring
will
be
sound
capable
of
attaining
full
growth
and
we
do
have
the
to
cope
with
any
more
there
room
for
people
again
so
why
not
try
it
stop
the
injections
and
allow
babies
to
be
born
as
they
were
before
littlejohn
hesitated
before
adding
a
final
word
but
he
knew
he
had
to
add
it
he
knew
it
now
normally
he
said
thurmon
nodded
so
that
is
your
answer
yes
i
i
think
it
will
work
so
do
the
biologists
thurmon
told
him
a
generation
of
normal
infants
reared
to
maturity
would
restore
mankind
to
its
former
stature
in
every
sense
of
the
word
and
now
knowing
the
lessons
of
the
past
we
could
prepare
for
the
change
to
come
we
could
rebuild
the
world
for
them
to
live
in
rebuild
it
psychically
as
well
as
physically
we
plan
to
eliminate
the
rivalry
between
the
large
and
the
small
the
strong
and
the
weak
it
would
be
difficult
because
there
plenty
for
all
there
be
no
trouble
as
there
was
in
the
old
days
we
learned
to
be
psychologically
flexible
littlejohn
smiled
then
that
the
solution
he
asked
yes
eliminating
the
leffingwell
injections
will
give
us
a
good
proportion
of
normal
children
again
where
do
we
find
the
normal
women
to
bear
them
normal
women
thurmon
sighed
then
reached
over
and
placed
a
scroll
in
the
scanner
i
have
already
gone
into
that
question
with
research
technicians
he
said
and
i
have
the
figures
here
he
switched
on
the
scanner
and
began
to
read
the
average
nubile
female
aged
thirteen
to
is
two
feet
ten
inches
high
and
weighs
pounds
thurmon
flicked
the
switch
again
and
peered
up
i
do
think
i
bother
with
pelvic
measurements
he
said
you
can
already
see
that
giving
birth
to
a
six
or
infant
is
a
physical
impossibility
under
the
circumstances
it
can
not
be
done
but
surely
there
must
be
larger
females
perhaps
a
system
of
selective
breeding
on
a
gradual
basis
you
talking
in
terms
of
generations
we
have
got
that
much
time
thurmon
shook
his
head
no
we
stopped
right
here
we
get
normal
babies
without
normal
women
and
the
only
normal
women
are
those
who
began
life
as
normal
babies
which
comes
first
littlejohn
murmured
the
chicken
or
the
egg
what
that
nothing
just
an
old
saying
from
history
thurmon
frowned
apparently
then
that
all
you
can
offer
in
your
professional
capacity
as
an
historian
just
some
old
sayings
he
sighed
too
bad
you
do
know
some
old
prayers
because
we
need
them
now
he
bowed
his
head
signifying
the
end
of
the
interview
littlejohn
rolled
out
of
the
room
his
took
him
back
to
his
own
dwelling
back
across
the
rooftops
of
new
chicagee
ordinarily
littlejohn
avoided
looking
down
he
dreaded
heights
and
the
immensity
of
the
city
itself
was
somehow
appalling
but
now
he
gazed
upon
the
capital
and
center
of
civilization
with
a
certain
morbid
affection
new
chicagee
had
risen
on
the
ashes
of
the
old
after
the
war
end
use
of
had
been
limited
fortunately
so
radioactivity
did
not
linger
and
the
vast
craters
hollowed
out
by
ordinary
warheads
had
been
partially
filled
by
rubble
and
debris
artificial
fill
had
done
the
rest
of
the
job
so
that
now
new
chicagee
was
merely
a
flat
prairie
as
it
must
have
been
hundreds
of
years
ago
a
flat
prairie
on
which
the
city
had
been
resurrected
there
were
almost
fifty
thousand
people
here
in
the
capital
the
largest
congregation
of
population
on
the
entire
continent
they
had
built
well
and
surely
this
time
built
for
the
security
and
certainty
of
centuries
to
come
littlejohn
sighed
it
was
hard
to
accept
the
fact
that
they
had
been
wrong
that
all
this
would
end
in
nothingness
they
had
eliminated
war
eliminated
disease
eliminated
famine
eliminated
social
inequality
injustice
disorders
external
and
internal
and
in
so
doing
they
had
eliminated
themselves
the
sun
was
setting
in
the
west
and
long
shadows
crept
over
the
city
below
yes
the
sun
was
setting
and
the
shadows
were
gathering
the
night
was
coming
to
claim
its
own
darkness
was
falling
eternal
darkness
it
was
quite
dark
by
the
time
littlejohn
landed
on
the
rooftop
of
his
own
dwelling
so
dark
in
fact
that
for
a
moment
he
did
see
the
strange
vehicle
already
standing
there
not
until
he
had
settled
into
his
coasterchair
did
he
notice
the
presence
of
the
other
and
then
it
was
too
late
too
late
to
do
anything
except
sit
and
stare
as
the
gigantic
shadow
loomed
out
of
the
night
silhouetted
against
the
sky
the
shadow
shambled
forward
and
littlejohn
gaped
gaped
in
terror
at
the
titanic
figure
he
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
but
words
did
not
form
there
were
no
words
to
form
for
how
does
one
address
an
apparition
instead
it
was
the
apparition
which
spoke
i
have
been
waiting
for
you
it
said
i
want
to
talk
to
you
the
voice
was
deep
menacing
littlejohn
shifted
in
his
coasterchair
there
was
nowhere
to
go
no
escape
he
gazed
up
at
the
shadow
finally
he
summoned
a
response
shall
we
go
inside
he
asked
the
figure
shook
its
head
where
down
into
that
dollhouse
of
yours
it
is
big
enough
i
already
been
there
what
i
have
to
say
can
be
said
right
here
are
you
the
figure
stepped
forward
so
that
its
face
was
illuminated
by
the
fluorescence
streaming
from
the
open
door
which
led
to
the
inclined
chairway
descending
to
littlejohn
dwelling
littlejohn
could
see
the
face
now
the
gigantic
wrinkled
face
scarred
and
seared
and
seamed
it
was
a
human
face
but
utterly
alien
to
the
humanity
littlejohn
knew
faces
such
as
this
one
had
disappeared
from
the
earth
a
lifetime
ago
at
least
history
had
taught
him
that
history
had
not
prepared
him
for
the
actual
living
presence
of
a
naturalist
littlejohn
gasped
you
a
naturalist
yes
what
you
are
the
apparition
scowled
i
am
not
a
naturalist
i
am
a
man
but
you
ca
be
the
war
i
am
very
old
i
lived
through
your
war
i
have
lived
through
your
peace
soon
i
shall
die
but
before
i
do
there
is
something
else
which
must
be
done
you
come
here
to
kill
me
perhaps
the
looming
figure
moved
closer
and
stared
down
no
try
to
summon
help
when
your
servants
saw
me
they
fled
you
alone
now
littlejohn
you
know
my
name
yes
i
know
your
name
i
know
the
names
of
everyone
on
the
council
each
of
them
has
a
visitor
tonight
then
it
is
a
plot
a
conspiracy
we
have
planned
this
very
carefully
through
the
long
years
it
all
we
lived
for
those
few
of
us
who
survived
the
war
but
the
council
was
responsible
for
the
war
most
of
us
even
alive
then
believe
me
we
were
to
blame
i
know
the
gigantic
face
creased
in
senile
simulation
of
a
smile
nobody
was
ever
to
blame
for
anything
nobody
was
ever
responsible
that
what
they
always
told
me
i
must
hate
mankind
for
multiplying
even
though
population
created
pressure
and
pressure
created
panic
that
drove
me
mad
i
must
blame
leffingwell
for
solving
the
overpopulation
problem
even
though
he
used
me
as
a
in
his
experiments
i
must
blame
the
yardsticks
for
penning
me
up
in
prison
until
revolution
broke
out
and
i
blame
the
naturalists
for
bombing
the
place
where
i
took
refuge
so
whose
fault
was
it
that
i
gone
through
eighty
years
of
assorted
hell
why
did
i
harry
collins
get
singled
out
for
a
lifetime
of
misery
and
misfortune
the
huge
old
man
bent
over
huddled
form
maybe
it
was
all
a
means
to
an
end
a
way
of
bringing
me
here
at
this
moment
to
do
what
must
be
done
do
harm
me
you
not
well
you
crazy
the
old
man
shook
his
head
no
i
not
crazy
not
now
but
i
been
at
times
during
my
life
perhaps
we
all
are
when
we
attempt
to
face
up
to
the
complications
of
an
average
existence
try
to
confront
the
problems
which
are
too
big
for
a
single
consciousness
to
cope
with
in
a
single
i
been
crazy
in
the
city
and
crazy
in
the
isolation
of
a
cell
and
crazy
in
the
welter
of
war
and
perhaps
the
worst
time
of
all
was
when
i
lost
my
son
yes
i
had
a
son
littlejohn
he
was
one
of
the
first
one
of
leffingwell
original
mutations
and
i
never
knew
him
very
well
until
the
revolution
came
and
we
went
away
together
he
was
a
doctor
my
boy
and
a
good
one
we
spent
almost
five
years
together
and
i
learned
a
lot
from
him
about
medicine
but
that
was
important
then
thinking
of
what
i
learned
about
love
i
always
hated
yardsticks
but
my
son
was
one
and
i
came
to
love
him
he
had
plans
for
rebuilding
the
world
he
and
i
and
the
rest
of
us
we
were
going
to
wait
until
the
revolution
ended
and
then
help
restore
sanity
in
civilization
but
the
naturalists
flew
over
and
dropped
their
bomb
and
my
boy
died
over
four
hundred
of
our
group
died
there
in
the
canyon
four
hundred
who
might
have
changed
the
fate
of
the
world
do
you
think
i
can
forget
that
do
you
think
i
and
the
few
others
who
survived
have
ever
forgotten
can
you
blame
us
if
we
did
go
crazy
if
we
hid
away
out
there
in
the
western
wilderness
hid
away
from
a
world
that
had
offered
us
nothing
but
death
and
destruction
and
plotted
to
bring
death
and
destruction
to
that
world
in
return
think
about
it
for
a
moment
littlejohn
we
were
old
men
all
of
us
and
the
world
had
given
us
only
its
misery
to
bear
during
our
lifetimes
the
world
we
wanted
to
save
was
destroying
itself
why
should
we
be
concerned
with
its
fate
or
future
so
we
changed
our
plans
littlejohn
perhaps
the
shock
had
been
too
much
instead
of
plotting
to
rebuild
the
world
we
turned
our
thoughts
to
completing
its
destruction
our
tools
and
texts
were
gone
buried
in
the
rubble
with
the
bodies
of
fine
young
men
but
we
had
our
minds
crazed
minds
you
call
them
but
aware
of
reality
the
grim
reality
of
the
years
we
burrowed
away
in
the
desert
we
schemed
and
we
dreamed
from
time
to
time
we
sent
out
spies
we
knew
what
was
going
on
we
knew
the
naturalists
were
gone
that
had
vanished
from
a
yardstick
world
we
knew
about
the
rehabilitation
projects
we
watched
your
people
gradually
evolve
new
patterns
of
living
and
learning
some
of
the
former
knowledge
was
rescued
but
not
all
our
little
group
had
far
more
learning
than
you
ever
dreamed
of
fifty
of
us
between
ourselves
could
have
surpassed
all
your
scientists
in
every
field
but
we
watched
and
we
waited
and
some
of
us
died
of
privation
and
some
of
us
died
of
old
age
until
at
last
there
were
only
a
dozen
of
us
to
share
the
dream
the
dream
of
destruction
and
we
knew
that
we
must
act
swiftly
or
not
at
all
so
we
came
into
the
world
cautiously
and
carefully
moving
unobtrusively
and
unobserved
we
wanted
to
contemplate
the
corruption
seek
out
the
weaknesses
in
your
degenerate
civilization
and
we
found
them
immediately
those
weaknesses
are
everywhere
apparent
for
they
are
physical
you
one
of
a
dying
race
littlejohn
mankind
days
are
numbered
there
no
need
for
grandiose
schemes
of
reactivating
warheads
in
buried
of
loosing
upon
the
world
merely
by
killing
off
the
central
council
here
in
new
chicagee
we
can
accomplish
our
objective
a
dozen
men
die
and
there
not
enough
initiative
left
to
replace
them
it
as
simple
as
that
and
as
complicated
harry
collins
nodded
yes
as
complicated
because
the
only
weaknesses
we
observed
physical
ones
we
seen
enough
of
the
ways
of
this
new
civilization
to
realize
that
all
of
the
things
i
hated
during
my
lifetime
have
disappeared
now
the
crowding
the
competition
the
sordid
the
bigotry
intolerance
prejudice
the
aspects
of
society
are
gone
there
is
only
the
human
race
living
much
closer
to
the
concept
of
utopia
than
i
ever
dreamed
possible
you
and
the
other
survivors
have
done
well
littlejohn
and
yet
you
come
to
kill
us
we
came
for
that
purpose
because
still
retained
the
flaws
and
failings
of
our
former
cultures
we
looked
for
targets
to
blame
for
villains
to
hate
and
destroy
instead
we
found
this
reality
no
i
not
crazy
littlejohn
and
i
and
my
fellows
are
here
to
execute
revenge
we
have
returned
to
the
original
plan
the
plan
leffingwell
had
and
my
son
and
all
the
others
who
worked
in
their
own
way
for
their
dream
of
a
better
world
we
come
now
to
help
you
help
you
before
you
die
before
we
die
littlejohn
looked
up
and
sighed
why
could
this
have
happened
before
he
murmured
it
too
late
now
but
it
is
too
late
my
friends
are
here
they
are
telling
your
fellow
the
same
thing
right
now
we
may
be
old
but
we
can
still
impart
what
we
have
learned
there
are
any
number
of
technological
developments
to
be
made
we
can
help
you
to
increase
your
use
of
atomic
power
there
soil
reclamation
and
irrigation
projects
and
biological
techniques
you
said
it
yourself
littlejohn
whispered
we
a
dying
race
that
the
primary
problem
and
it
an
insoluble
one
just
this
afternoon
and
he
told
him
about
the
interview
with
thurmon
do
you
understand
littlejohn
concluded
we
have
no
solution
for
survival
we
paying
the
price
now
because
for
a
while
we
heed
history
we
tried
to
defeat
nature
and
in
the
end
nature
has
defeated
us
because
we
would
not
render
unto
caesar
the
things
which
are
harry
collins
smiled
that
it
he
said
what
caesar
that
the
answer
your
own
medical
men
must
have
records
i
know
because
i
learned
medicine
from
my
son
there
used
to
be
an
operation
in
the
old
days
called
a
caesarean
section
used
on
normal
women
and
on
dwarfs
and
midgets
too
in
childbirth
if
your
problem
is
how
to
deliver
normal
children
safely
the
technique
can
be
revived
get
hold
of
some
of
your
people
let
see
what
data
you
have
on
this
i
be
glad
to
furnish
instruction
there
was
excitement
after
that
too
much
excitement
for
littlejohn
by
the
time
the
council
had
assembled
in
emergency
session
by
the
time
plans
were
formulated
and
he
returned
to
his
own
dwelling
in
the
helicopter
he
was
completely
exhausted
only
the
edge
of
elation
sustained
him
the
realization
that
a
solution
had
been
found
as
he
sank
into
slumber
he
knew
that
he
would
sleep
the
clock
around
and
so
would
harry
collins
the
old
man
and
his
companions
now
guests
of
the
council
had
been
temporarily
quartered
in
the
it
was
the
only
structure
large
enough
to
house
them
and
even
so
they
had
to
sleep
on
the
floor
but
it
was
sufficient
comfort
for
the
moment
it
was
many
hours
before
harry
collins
awoke
his
waking
was
automatic
for
the
tiny
telescreen
at
the
end
of
the
council
room
glowed
suddenly
and
the
traditional
voice
chirped
forth
to
interrupt
his
slumber
good
morning
said
the
voice
it
a
beautiful
day
in
new
chicagee
harry
stared
at
the
screen
and
then
he
smiled
yes
he
murmured
but
tomorrow
will
be
better
the
end
