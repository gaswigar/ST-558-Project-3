devote
himself
to
writing
in
the
following
years
he
wrote

of
which
are
among
the
very
best
of
english
literature
and
some
of
which
are
still

marryat
had
an
extraordinary
gift
for
the
invention
of
episodes
in
his
stories
he
says
somewhere
that
when
he
sat
down
for
the
day
work
he
never
knew
what
he
was
going
to
write
he
certainly
was
a
literary
genius

repulsed
with
loss
in
compliance
with
your
request
i
shall
now
transcribe
from
the
journal
of
my
younger
days
some
portions
of
my
adventurous
life
when
i
wrote
i
painted
the
feelings
of
my
heart
without
reserve
and
i
shall
not
alter
one
word
as
i
know
you
wish
to
learn
what
my
feelings
were
then
and
not
what
my
thoughts
may
be
now
they
say
that
in
every
man
life
however
obscure
his
position
may
be
there
would
be
a
moral
found
were
it
truly
told
i
think
madam
when
you
have
perused
what
i
am
about
to
write
you
will
agree
with
me
that
from
my
history
both
old
and
young
may
gather
profit
and
i
trust
if
ever
it
should
be
made
public
that
by
divine
permission
such
may
be
the
result
without
further
preface
i
shall
commence
with
a
narrative
of
my
cruise
off
hispaniola
in
the
revenge
privateer
the
revenge
mounted
fourteen
guns
and
was
commanded
by
captain
weatherall
a
very
noted
one
morning
at
daybreak
we
discovered
a
vessel
from
the
masthead
and
immediately
made
all
sail
in
chase
crowding
every
stitch
of
canvass
as
we
neared
we
made
her
out
to
be
a
large
ship
deeply
laden
and
we
imagined
that
she
would
be
an
easy
prize
but
as
we
saw
her
hull
more
out
of
the
water
she
proved
to
be
well
armed
having
a
full
tier
of
guns
fore
and
aft
as
it
afterwards
proved
she
was
a
vessel
of
tons
burden
and
mounted
guns
having
sailed
from
saint
domingo
and
being
bound
to
france
she
had
been
chartered
by
a
french
gentleman
and
a
most
gallant
fellow
we
found
him
who
had
acquired
a
large
fortune
in
the
west
indies
and
was
then
going
home
having
embarked
on
board
his
whole
property
as
well
as
his
wife
and
his
only
son
a
youth
of
about
seventeen
as
soon
as
he
discovered
what
we
were
and
the
impossibility
of
escape
from
so
fast
a
sailing
vessel
as
the
revenge
he
resolved
to
fight
us
to
the
last
indeed
he
had
everything
to
fight
for
his
whole
property
his
wife
and
his
only
child
his
own
liberty
and
perhaps
life
were
all
at
stake
and
he
had
every
motive
that
could
stimulate
a
man
as
we
subsequently
learnt
he
had
great
difficulty
in
inspiring
the
crew
with
an
equal
resolution
and
it
was
not
until
he
had
engaged
to
pay
them
the
value
of
half
the
cargo
provided
they
succeeded
in
beating
us
off
and
forcing
their
way
in
safety
to
france
that
he
could
rouse
them
to
their
duty
won
by
his
example
for
he
told
them
that
he
did
not
desire
any
man
to
do
more
than
he
would
do
himself
and
perhaps
more
induced
by
his
generous
offer
the
french
crew
declared
they
would
support
him
to
the
last
went
cheerfully
to
their
guns
and
prepared
for
action
when
we
were
pretty
near
to
him
he
shortened
sail
ready
for
the
combat
having
tenderly
forced
his
wife
down
below
to
await
in
agony
the
issue
of
a
battle
on
which
depended
everything
so
dear
to
her
the
resolute
bearing
of
the
vessel
and
the
cool
intrepidity
with
which
they
had
to
await
us
made
us
also
prepare
on
our
side
for
a
combat
which
we
knew
would
be
severe
although
she
was
superior
to
us
in
guns
yet
the
revenge
being
wholly
fitted
for
war
we
had
many
advantages
independent
of
our
being
very
superior
in
men
some
few
were
fired
during
our
approach
when
having
ranged
up
within
a
length
of
her
we
exchanged
broadsides
for
half
an
hour
after
which
our
captain
determined
upon
boarding
we
ran
our
vessel
alongside
and
attempted
to
throw
our
men
on
board
but
met
with
a
stout
resistance
the
french
gentleman
who
was
at
the
head
of
his
men
with
his
own
hand
killed
two
of
our
stoutest
seamen
and
mortally
wounded
a
third
and
encouraged
by
his
example
his
people
fought
with
such
resolution
that
after
a
severe
struggle
we
were
obliged
to
retreat
precipitately
into
our
own
vessel
leaving
eight
or
ten
of
our
shipmates
weltering
in
their
blood
our
captain
who
had
not
boarded
with
us
was
much
enraged
at
our
defeat
stigmatising
us
as
cowards
for
allowing
ourselves
to
be
driven
from
a
deck
upon
which
we
had
obtained
a
footing
he
called
upon
us
to
renew
the
combat
and
leading
the
way
he
was
the
first
on
board
of
the
vessel
and
was
engaged
hand
to
hand
with
the
brave
french
gentleman
who
had
already
made
such
slaughter
among
our
men
brave
and
expert
with
his
weapon
as
captain
weatherall
undoubtedly
was
he
for
once
found
rather
more
than
a
match
in
his
antagonist
he
was
slightly
wounded
and
would
i
suspect
have
had
the
worst
of
this
conflict
had
not
the
whole
of
our
crew
who
had
now
gained
the
deck
and
were
rushing
forward
separated
him
from
his
opponent
and
the
french
crew
fought
most
resolutely
but
notwithstanding
their
exertions
and
the
gallant
conduct
of
their
leader
we
succeeded
in
driving
them
back
to
the
of
the
vessel
here
the
combat
was
renewed
with
the
greatest
obstinacy
they
striving
to
maintain
this
their
last
hold
and
we
exerting
ourselves
to
complete
our
conquest
the
frenchmen
could
retreat
no
further
and
our
foremost
men
were
impelled
against
them
by
those
behind
them
crowding
on
to
share
in
the
combat
retreat
being
cut
off
the
french
struggled
with
all
the
animosity
and
rage
of
mingled
hate
and
despair
while
we
infuriated
at
the
obstinate
resistance
were
filled
with
vengeance
and
a
thirst
for
blood
wedged
into
one
mass
we
grappled
together
for
there
was
no
room
for
fair
fighting
seeking
each
other
hearts
with
shortened
weapons
struggling
and
falling
together
on
the
deck
rolling
among
the
dead
and
the
dying
or
trodden
underfoot
by
the
others
who
still
maintained
the
combat
with
unabated
fury
numbers
at
last
prevailed
we
had
gained
a
victory
we
were
masters
of
the
deck
we
had
struck
the
colours
and
were
recovering
our
lost
breaths
after
this
very
severe
contest
and
thought
ourselves
in
full
possession
of
the
ship
but
it
proved
otherwise
the
of
the
privateer
and
six
of
us
had
dashed
down
the
companion
and
were
entering
the
cabin
in
search
of
plunder
when
we
found
opposed
to
our
entrance
the
gallant
french
gentleman
supported
by
his
son
the
captain
of
the
vessel
and
five
of
the
french
sailors
behind
them
was
the
french
gentleman
wife
to
whose
protection
they
had
devoted
themselves
the
lieutenant
who
headed
us
offered
them
quarter
but
stung
to
madness
at
the
prospect
of
the
ruin
and
of
the
captivity
which
awaited
him
the
gentleman
treated
the
offer
with
contempt
and
rushing
forward
attacked
our
lieutenant
beating
down
his
guard
and
was
just
about
to
pierce
him
with
the
lunge
which
he
made
when
i
fired
my
pistol
at
him
to
save
the
life
of
my
officer
the
ball
entered
his
heart
and
thus
died
one
of
the
bravest
men
i
ever
encountered
his
son
at
the
same
time
was
felled
to
the
deck
with
a
when
the
remainder
threw
themselves
down
on
the
deck
and
cried
for
quarter
so
enraged
were
our
men
at
this
renewal
of
the
combat
that
it
required
all
the
efforts
and
authority
of
the
lieutenant
to
prevent
them
from
completing
the
massacre
by
taking
the
lives
of
those
who
no
longer
resisted
but
who
could
paint
the
condition
of
that
unhappy
lady
who
had
stood
a
witness
of
the
horrid
scene
her
eyes
blasted
with
the
sight
of
her
husband
slain
before
her
face
her
only
son
groaning
on
the
deck
and
weltering
in
his
blood
and
she
left
alone
bereft
of
all
that
was
dear
to
her
stripped
of
the
wealth
she
was
that
morning
mistress
of
now
a
widow
perhaps
childless
a
prisoner
a
beggar
and
in
the
hands
of
lawless
ruffians
whose
hands
were
reeking
with
her
and
offspring
blood
at
their
mercy
and
exposed
to
every
evil
which
must
befall
a
beautiful
and
unprotected
female
from
those
who
were
devoid
of
all
principle
all
pity
and
all
fear
well
might
the
frantic
creature
rush
as
she
did
upon
our
weapons
and
seek
that
death
which
would
have
been
a
mercy
and
a
blessing
with
difficulty
we
prevented
her
from
injuring
herself
and
after
a
violent
struggle
nature
yielded
and
she
sank
down
in
a
swoon
on
the
body
of
her
husband
dabbling
her
clothes
and
hair
in
the
gore
which
floated
on
the
this
scene
of
misery
shocked
even
the
actors
in
it
our
sailors
accustomed
as
they
were
to
blood
and
rapine
remained
silent
and
immoveable
resting
upon
their
weapons
their
eyes
fixed
upon
the
unconscious
form
of
that
unhappy
lady
the
rage
of
battle
was
now
over
our
passions
had
subsided
and
we
felt
ashamed
of
a
conquest
purchased
with
such
unutterable
anguish
the
noise
of
this
renewed
combat
had
brought
down
the
captain
he
ordered
the
lady
to
be
taken
away
from
this
scene
of
horror
and
to
be
carefully
tended
in
his
own
cabin
the
wound
of
the
son
who
was
found
still
alive
was
immediately
dressed
and
the
prisoners
were
secured
i
returned
on
deck
still
oppressed
with
the
scene
i
had
witnessed
and
when
i
looked
round
me
and
beheld
the
deck
strewed
with
the
dead
and
dying
victors
and
vanquished
indiscriminately
mixed
up
together
the
blood
of
both
nations
meeting
on
the
deck
and
joining
their
streams
i
could
not
help
putting
the
question
to
myself
can
this
be
right
and
lawful
all
this
carnage
to
obtain
the
property
of
others
and
made
legal
by
the
quarrels
of
kings
reason
religion
and
humanity
answered
no
i
remained
uneasy
and
dissatisfied
and
felt
as
if
i
were
a
murderer
and
then
i
reflected
how
this
property
thus
wrested
from
its
former
possessor
who
might
if
he
had
retained
it
have
done
much
good
with
it
would
now
be
squandered
away
in
riot
and
dissipation
in
purchasing
crime
and
administering
to
debauchery
i
was
young
then
and
felt
so
disgusted
and
so
angry
with
myself
and
everybody
else
that
if
i
had
been
in
england
i
probably
should
never
again
have
put
my
foot
on
board
of
a
privateer
but
employment
prevented
my
thinking
the
decks
had
to
be
cleaned
the
bodies
thrown
overboard
the
blood
washed
from
the
white
planks
the
wounded
to
be
removed
and
their
hurts
dressed
the
rigging
and
other
damages
to
be
repaired
and
when
all
this
had
been
done
we
made
sail
for
jamaica
with
our
prize
our
captain
who
was
as
kind
and
gentle
to
the
vanquished
as
he
was
brave
and
resolute
in
action
endeavoured
by
all
the
means
he
could
think
of
to
soften
the
captivity
and
sufferings
of
the
lady
her
clothes
jewels
and
everything
belonging
to
her
were
preserved
untouched
he
would
not
even
allow
her
trunks
to
be
searched
and
would
have
secured
for
her
even
all
her
husband
personal
effects
but
the
crew
had
seized
upon
them
as
plunder
and
refused
to
deliver
them
up
i
am
almost
ashamed
to
say
that
the
sword
and
watch
of
her
husband
fell
to
my
lot
and
whether
from
my
wearing
the
sword
or
from
having
seen
me
fire
the
pistol
which
had
killed
him
the
lady
always
expressed
her
abhorrence
of
me
whenever
i
entered
her
presence
her
son
recovered
slowly
from
his
wound
and
on
our
arrival
at
port
royal
was
permitted
by
the
admiral
to
be
sent
to
the
king
hospital
and
the
lady
who
was
most
tenderly
attached
to
him
went
on
shore
and
remained
at
the
hospital
to
attend
upon
him
i
was
glad
when
she
was
gone
for
i
knew
how
much
cause
she
had
for
her
hatred
of
me
and
i
could
not
see
her
without
remorse
as
soon
as
we
had
completed
our
repairs
filled
up
our
provisions
and
water
we
sailed
upon
another
cruise
which
was
not
so
successful
as
you
will
presently
perceive
for
five
or
six
weeks
we
cruised
without
success
and
our
people
began
to
grumble
when
one
morning
our
boats
in
shore
off
hispaniola
surprised
a
small
schooner
a
negro
who
was
among
the
prisoners
offered
to
conduct
us
through
the
woods
by
night
to
the
house
of
a
very
rich
planter
which
was
situated
about
three
miles
from
a
small
bay
and
at
some
distance
from
the
other
plantations
he
asserted
that
we
might
there
get
very
valuable
plunder
and
moreover
obtain
a
large
ransom
for
the
planter
and
his
family
besides
bringing
away
as
many
of
the
negro
slaves
as
we
pleased
our
captain
who
was
tired
of
his
and
who
hoped
also
to
procure
provisions
which
we
very
much
wanted
consented
to
the
proposal
and
standing
down
abreast
of
the
bay
which
was
in
the
bight
of
lugan
he
ran
in
at
dark
and
anchoring
close
to
the
shore
we
landed
with
forty
men
and
guided
by
the
negro
we
proceeded
through
the
woods
to
the
house
the
negro
was
tied
fast
to
one
of
our
stoutest
and
best
men
for
fear
he
should
give
us
the
slip
it
was
a
bright
moonlight
we
soon
arrived
and
surrounding
the
house
forced
our
way
in
without
opposition
having
secured
the
negroes
in
the
and
placed
guards
over
them
and
videttes
on
the
to
give
timely
notice
of
any
surprise
we
proceeded
to
our
work
of
plunder
the
family
consisting
of
the
old
planter
and
his
wife
and
his
three
daughters
two
of
them
very
beautiful
was
secured
in
one
room
no
words
can
express
their
terror
at
thus
finding
themselves
so
suddenly
in
the
power
of
a
set
of
ruffians
from
whose
brutality
they
anticipated
every
evil
indeed
the
horrid
excesses
committed
by
the
privateersmen
when
they
landed
on
the
coast
fully
justified
their
fears
for
as
this
system
of
marauding
is
considered
the
basest
of
all
modern
warfare
no
quarter
is
ever
given
to
those
who
are
taken
in
the
attempt
in
return
the
privateersmen
hesitate
at
no
barbarity
when
engaged
in
such
enterprises
dumb
with
astonishment
and
terror
the
old
couple
sat
in
silent
agony
while
the
poor
girls
who
had
more
evils
than
death
to
fear
drowned
in
their
tears
fell
at
the
captain
feet
and
embraced
his
knees
conjuring
him
to
spare
and
protect
them
from
his
men
captain
weatherall
who
was
as
i
have
before
stated
a
generous
and
humane
man
raised
them
up
assuring
them
on
his
word
that
they
should
receive
no
insult
and
as
his
presence
was
necessary
to
direct
the
motions
of
his
people
he
selected
me
as
younger
and
less
brutal
than
most
of
his
crew
as
a
guard
over
them
menacing
me
with
death
if
i
allowed
any
man
to
enter
the
room
until
he
returned
and
ordering
me
to
defend
them
with
my
life
from
all
insults
i
was
then
young
and
full
of
enthusiasm
my
heart
was
kind
and
i
was
pure
in
comparison
with
the
major
portion
of
those
with
whom
i
was
associated
i
was
delighted
with
the
office
confided
to
me
and
my
heart
leaped
at
having
so
honourable
an
employment
i
endeavoured
by
every
means
in
my
power
to
dissipate
their
terrors
and
soothe
their
anxious
minds
but
while
i
was
thus
employed
an
irish
seaman
distinguished
even
amongst
our
crew
for
his
atrocities
came
to
the
door
and
would
have
forced
his
entrance
i
instantly
opposed
him
urging
the
captain
most
positive
commands
but
having
obtained
a
sight
of
the
young
females
he
swore
with
a
vile
oath
that
he
would
soon
find
out
whether
a
boy
like
me
was
able
to
oppose
him
and
finding
that
i
would
not
give
way
he
attacked
me
fiercely
fortunately
i
had
the
advantage
of
position
and
supported
by
the
justice
of
my
cause
i
repelled
him
with
success
but
he
renewed
the
attack
while
the
poor
young
women
awaited
the
issue
of
the
combat
with
trembling
anxiety
a
combat
on
which
depended
in
all
probability
their
honour
and
their
lives
at
last
i
found
myself
very
hard
pushed
for
i
had
received
a
wound
on
my
sword
arm
and
i
drew
a
pistol
from
my
belt
with
my
left
hand
and
fired
it
wounding
him
in
the
shoulder
thus
disabled
and
fearing
at
the
same
time
that
the
report
would
bring
back
the
captain
who
he
well
knew
would
not
be
trifled
with
he
retired
from
the
door
vowing
vengeance
i
then
turned
to
the
young
women
who
had
witnessed
the
conflict
in
breathless
suspense
encircled
in
the
arms
of
the
poor
old
couple
who
had
rushed
towards
them
at
the
commencement
of
the
fray
offering
them
their
useless
shelter
privateersman
as
i
was
i
could
not
refrain
from
tears
at
the
scene
i
again
attempted
to
them
pledged
myself
in
the
most
solemn
manner
to
forfeit
my
life
if
necessary
for
their
protection
and
they
in
some
degree
regained
their
confidence
they
observed
the
blood
trickling
down
my
fingers
from
the
wound
which
i
had
received
and
the
poor
girls
stained
their
handkerchiefs
with
it
in
the
attempts
to
staunch
the
flow
but
this
scene
was
soon
interrupted
by
an
alarm
it
appeared
that
a
negro
had
contrived
to
escape
and
to
rouse
the
country
they
had
collected
together
from
the
other
plantations
and
our
party
being
as
is
usually
the
case
when
plunder
is
going
on
very
negligent
the
videttes
were
surprised
and
had
hardly
time
to
escape
and
apprise
us
of
our
danger
there
was
not
a
moment
to
be
lost
our
safety
depended
upon
an
immediate
retreat
the
captain
collected
all
hands
and
while
he
was
getting
them
together
that
the
retreat
might
be
made
in
good
order
the
old
planter
who
by
the
report
of
the
and
the
bustle
and
confusion
without
guessed
what
had
taken
place
pressed
me
to
remain
with
them
urging
the
certainty
of
our
men
being
overpowered
and
the
merciless
consequences
which
would
ensue
he
pledged
himself
with
his
fingers
crossed
in
the
form
of
the
crucifix
that
he
would
procure
me
safe
quarter
and
that
i
should
ever
enjoy
his
protection
and
friendship
i
refused
him
kindly
but
firmly
and
he
sighed
and
said
no
more
the
old
lady
put
a
ring
on
my
finger
which
she
took
from
her
own
hand
and
kissing
my
forehead
told
me
to
look
at
that
ring
and
continue
to
do
good
and
act
nobly
as
i
had
just
done
i
waved
my
hand
for
i
had
no
time
even
to
take
the
proffered
hands
of
the
young
ones
and
hastened
to
join
my
shipmates
already
on
the
retreat
and
exchanging
shots
with
our
pursuers
we
were
harassed
by
a
multitude
but
they
were
a
mixed
company
of
planters
mulattoes
and
slaves
and
not
half
of
them
armed
and
we
easily
repelled
their
attacks
whenever
they
came
to
close
quarters
their
violent
animosity
however
against
us
and
our
evil
doings
induced
them
to
follow
close
at
our
heels
keeping
up
a
galling
irregular
fire
and
endeavouring
to
detain
us
until
we
might
be
overpowered
by
their
numbers
every
minute
increasing
for
the
whole
country
had
been
raised
and
were
flocking
in
this
our
captain
was
well
aware
of
and
therefore
made
all
the
haste
that
he
could
without
disturbing
the
regularity
of
his
retreat
to
where
our
boats
were
lying
as
should
they
be
surprised
and
cut
off
our
escape
would
have
been
impossible
notwithstanding
all
his
care
several
of
our
men
were
separated
from
us
by
the
intricacies
of
the
wood
or
from
wounds
which
they
had
received
and
which
prevented
them
from
keeping
up
with
us
at
last
after
repelling
many
attacks
each
time
more
formidable
than
the
preceding
we
gained
our
boats
and
embarking
with
the
greatest
precipitation
we
put
off
for
the
schooner
the
enemy
emboldened
by
our
flight
flocked
down
in
great
numbers
to
the
water
edge
and
we
had
the
mortification
to
hear
our
stragglers
who
had
been
captured
imploring
for
mercy
but
groans
and
then
silence
too
plainly
informed
us
that
mercy
had
been
denied
captain
weatherall
was
so
enraged
at
the
loss
of
his
men
that
he
ordered
us
to
pull
back
and
attack
the
enemy
on
the
beach
but
we
continued
to
pull
for
the
schooner
regardless
of
his
threats
and
entreaties
a
panic
had
seized
us
all
as
well
it
might
we
even
dreaded
the
and
irregular
fire
which
they
poured
upon
us
which
under
other
circumstances
would
have
occasioned
only
laughter
the
schooner
had
been
anchored
only
two
hundred
yards
from
the
beach
and
we
were
soon
on
board
they
continued
to
fire
from
the
shore
and
the
balls
passed
over
us
we
put
a
spring
upon
our
cable
warped
our
broadside
to
the
beach
and
loading
every
gun
with
grape
and
cannister
we
poured
a
whole
broadside
upon
our
assailants
from
the
shrieks
and
cries
the
carnage
must
have
been
very
great
the
men
would
have
reloaded
and
fired
again
but
the
captain
forbade
them
saying
we
have
done
too
much
already
i
thought
so
too
he
then
ordered
the
anchor
to
be
weighed
and
with
a
fresh
land
breeze
we
were
soon
far
away
from
this
unlucky
spot
chapter
two
we
are
pursued
by
two
and
failing
to
escape
them
a
terrible
contest
ensues
three
acts
of
a
murderous
naval
drama
we
are
worsted
captain
weatherall
is
killed
i
am
plundered
and
wounded
about
six
weeks
after
the
unlucky
affair
before
described
we
met
with
a
still
greater
disaster
we
had
cruised
off
the
spanish
main
and
taken
several
prizes
shortly
after
we
had
manned
the
last
and
had
parted
company
the
revenge
being
then
close
in
shore
a
fresh
gale
sprung
up
which
compelled
us
to
make
all
sail
to
clear
the
land
we
beat
off
shore
during
the
whole
of
the
night
when
the
weather
moderated
and
at
daybreak
we
found
out
that
we
had
not
gained
much
offing
in
consequence
of
the
current
but
what
was
more
important
the
man
who
went
to
the
at
the
masthead
hailed
the
deck
saying
there
were
two
sails
in
the
offing
the
hands
were
turned
up
to
make
sail
in
chase
but
we
found
that
they
were
resolutely
bearing
down
upon
us
and
as
we
neared
each
other
fast
we
soon
made
them
out
to
be
vessels
of
force
one
we
knew
well
she
was
the
esperance
a
french
of
sixteen
guns
and
one
hundred
and
twenty
men
the
other
proved
to
be
a
spanish
cruising
in
company
with
her
of
eighteen
guns
and
full
manned
now
our
original
complement
of
men
had
been
something
more
than
one
hundred
but
by
deaths
severe
wounds
in
action
and
manning
our
prizes
our
actual
number
on
board
was
reduced
to
effective
men
finding
the
force
so
very
superior
we
made
every
attempt
with
sails
and
sweeps
to
escape
but
the
land
to
leeward
of
us
and
their
position
to
windward
rendered
it
impossible
making
therefore
a
virtue
of
necessity
we
put
a
good
face
upon
it
and
prepared
to
combat
against
such
desperate
odds
captain
weatherall
who
was
the
life
and
soul
of
his
crew
was
not
found
wanting
on
such
an
emergency
with
the
greatest
coolness
and
intrepidity
he
gave
orders
to
take
in
all
the
small
sails
and
awaited
the
coming
down
of
the
enemy
when
everything
was
ready
for
the
unequal
conflict
he
ordered
all
hands
aft
and
endeavoured
to
inspire
us
with
the
same
ardour
which
animated
himself
he
reminded
us
that
we
had
often
fought
and
triumphed
over
vessels
of
much
greater
force
than
our
own
that
we
had
already
beaten
off
the
french
privateer
on
a
former
occasion
that
the
spaniard
was
not
worth
talking
about
except
to
swell
the
merits
of
the
double
victory
and
that
if
once
we
came
hand
to
hand
our
cutlasses
would
soon
prove
our
superiority
he
reminded
us
that
our
only
safety
depended
upon
our
own
manhood
for
we
had
done
such
mischief
on
the
coast
and
our
recent
descent
upon
the
plantation
was
considered
in
such
a
light
that
we
must
not
expect
to
receive
quarter
if
we
were
overcome
exhorting
us
to
behave
well
and
to
fight
stoutly
he
promised
us
the
victory
the
men
had
such
confidence
in
the
captain
that
we
returned
him
three
cheers
when
dismissing
us
to
our
quarters
he
ordered
saint
george
ensign
to
be
hoisted
at
the
and
for
the
enemy
the
french
schooner
was
the
first
which
ranged
up
alongside
the
wind
was
light
and
she
came
slowly
down
to
us
the
captain
of
her
hailed
saying
that
his
vessel
was
the
esperance
and
our
captain
replied
that
he
knew
it
and
that
they
also
knew
that
his
was
the
revenge
the
french
captain
who
had
replied
very
courteously
that
he
was
well
aware
what
vessel
it
was
and
also
of
the
valour
and
distinguished
reputation
of
captain
weatherall
upon
which
captain
weatherall
who
stood
on
the
gunnel
took
off
his
hat
in
acknowledgment
of
the
compliment
now
captain
weatherall
was
and
it
was
also
that
the
two
vessels
would
meet
with
a
severe
resistance
which
it
would
be
as
well
to
avoid
as
even
if
they
gained
the
victory
it
would
not
be
without
great
loss
of
men
the
french
captain
therefore
addressed
captain
weatherall
again
and
said
he
hoped
now
that
he
was
opposed
to
so
very
superior
a
force
he
would
not
make
a
useless
resistance
but
as
it
would
be
no
disgrace
to
him
and
would
save
the
lives
of
many
of
his
brave
men
his
humanity
would
induce
him
to
strike
his
colours
to
this
request
our
commander
gave
a
gallant
and
positive
refusal
the
vessels
lay
now
close
to
each
other
so
that
a
biscuit
might
have
been
thrown
on
board
of
either
a
generous
expostulation
ensued
which
continued
till
the
spanish
vessel
was
a
short
distance
astern
of
us
you
now
see
our
force
said
the
french
captain
do
not
fight
against
impossible
odds
but
spare
your
brave
and
devoted
men
in
return
for
your
kind
feeling
towards
me
replied
captain
weatherall
i
offer
you
both
quarter
and
respect
to
private
property
upon
hauling
down
your
colours
you
are
mad
captain
weatherall
said
the
french
captain
you
allow
that
i
have
lived
bravely
replied
captain
weatherall
you
shall
find
that
i
will
conquer
you
and
if
necessary
i
will
also
die
bravely
we
will
now
fight
in
courtesy
i
offer
you
the
first
broadside
impossible
said
the
french
captain
taking
off
his
hat
our
captain
returned
the
salute
and
then
slipping
down
from
the
gunwale
ordered
the
sails
to
be
filled
and
after
a
minute
to
give
the
frenchman
time
to
prepare
he
fired
off
in
the
air
the
fusee
which
he
held
in
his
hand
as
a
signal
for
the
action
to
begin
we
instantly
commenced
the
work
of
death
by
pouring
in
a
broadside
it
was
returned
with
equal
spirit
and
a
furious
cannonading
ensued
for
several
minutes
when
the
spaniard
ranged
up
on
our
lee
quarter
with
his
rigging
full
of
men
to
board
us
clapping
our
helm
and
hauling
our
to
windward
we
fell
off
athwart
his
hawse
and
raked
him
with
several
broadsides
fore
and
aft
our
guns
having
been
loaded
with
langridge
and
lead
bullets
and
his
men
being
crowded
together
forward
ready
to
leap
on
board
of
us
her
deck
became
a
the
officers
endeavoured
in
vain
to
animate
their
men
who
instead
of
gaining
our
decks
were
so
intimidated
by
the
carnage
that
they
forsook
their
own
the
frenchman
perceiving
the
consternation
and
distress
of
his
consort
to
give
her
an
opportunity
of
extricating
herself
from
her
perilous
condition
now
put
his
helm
ran
us
on
board
and
poured
in
his
men
but
we
were
well
prepared
and
soon
cleared
our
decks
of
the
intruders
in
the
mean
time
the
spaniard
by
cutting
away
our
rigging
in
which
his
bowsprit
was
entangled
swung
clear
of
us
and
fell
away
to
leeward
the
frenchman
perceiving
this
sheered
off
and
springing
his
luff
shot
ahead
clear
of
us
such
was
the
first
act
of
this
terrible
drama
we
had
as
yet
sustained
little
damage
the
want
of
skill
and
our
good
fortune
combined
having
enabled
us
to
take
them
at
such
a
disadvantage
but
although
inspirited
by
such
a
prosperous
beginning
our
inferiority
in
men
was
so
great
that
our
captain
considered
it
his
duty
to
make
all
sail
in
hopes
of
being
able
to
avoid
such
an
unequal
combat
this
our
enemies
attempted
to
prevent
by
a
most
furious
cannonade
which
we
received
and
returned
without
flinching
making
a
running
fight
of
it
till
at
last
our
and
being
shot
away
we
had
no
longer
command
of
the
vessel
finding
that
although
we
were
crippled
and
could
not
escape
our
fire
continued
unabated
both
the
vessels
again
made
preparations
for
boarding
us
while
we
on
our
part
prepared
to
give
them
a
warm
reception
as
we
knew
that
the
frenchman
who
was
our
most
serious
opponent
must
board
us
on
our
we
traversed
over
four
of
our
guns
loaded
to
the
muzzle
with
to
receive
him
and
being
all
ready
with
our
pateraroes
and
hand
grenades
we
waited
for
the
attack
as
he
bore
down
for
our
bows
with
all
his
men
clinging
like
bees
ready
for
the
spring
our
guns
were
discharged
and
the
carnage
was
terrible
the
men
staggered
back
falling
down
over
those
who
had
been
killed
or
wounded
and
it
required
all
the
bravery
and
example
of
the
french
captain
who
was
really
a
noble
fellow
to
rally
the
remainder
of
his
men
which
at
last
he
succeeded
in
doing
and
about
forty
of
them
gained
our
forecastle
from
which
they
forced
our
weak
crew
and
retained
possession
not
following
up
the
success
but
apparently
waiting
till
they
were
seconded
by
the
spaniard
boarding
us
on
our
lee
quarter
which
would
have
placed
us
between
two
fires
and
compelled
us
to
divide
our
small
force
by
this
time
the
wind
which
had
been
light
left
us
and
it
was
nearly
a
calm
with
a
swell
on
the
sea
which
separated
the
two
vessels
the
spaniard
who
was
ranging
up
under
our
lee
having
but
little
way
and
not
luffing
enough
could
not
fetch
us
but
fell
off
and
drifted
to
leeward
the
frenchmen
who
had
been
thrown
on
board
and
who
retained
possession
of
our
forecastle
being
thus
left
without
support
from
their
own
vessel
which
had
been
separated
from
us
by
the
swell
or
from
the
spaniard
which
had
fallen
to
leeward
we
gave
three
cheers
and
throwing
a
number
of
hand
grenades
in
among
them
we
rushed
forward
with
our
and
killed
or
drove
every
soul
of
them
overboard
one
only
and
he
wounded
in
the
thigh
escaped
by
swimming
back
to
his
own
vessel
here
then
was
a
pause
in
the
conflict
and
thus
ended
i
may
say
the
second
act
hitherto
the
battle
had
been
fought
with
generous
resolution
but
after
this
conflict
and
the
massacre
with
which
it
ended
both
sides
appeared
to
have
been
roused
to
ferocity
a
most
infernal
cannonade
was
now
renewed
by
both
our
antagonists
and
returned
by
us
with
equal
fury
but
it
was
now
a
dead
calm
and
the
vessels
rolled
so
much
with
the
swell
that
the
shot
were
not
so
effective
by
degrees
we
separated
more
and
more
from
our
enemies
and
the
firing
was
now
reduced
to
single
guns
during
this
partial
cessation
our
antagonists
had
drawn
near
to
each
other
although
at
a
considerable
distance
from
us
we
perceived
that
the
spaniard
was
sending
two
of
his
boats
full
of
men
to
supply
the
heavy
loss
sustained
by
his
comrade
captain
weatherall
ordered
the
sweeps
out
and
we
swept
our
broadside
to
them
trying
by
single
guns
to
sink
the
boats
as
they
went
from
one
vessel
to
the
other
after
two
or
three
attempts
a
gun
was
successful
the
shot
shattered
the
first
of
the
boats
which
instantly
filled
and
went
down
the
second
boat
pulled
up
and
endeavoured
to
save
the
men
but
we
now
poured
our
broadside
upon
them
and
daunted
by
the
shot
flying
about
them
they
sought
their
own
safety
by
pulling
back
to
the
vessel
leaving
their
sinking
companions
to
their
fate
failing
in
this
attempt
both
vessels
recommenced
their
fire
upon
us
but
the
distance
and
the
swell
of
the
sea
prevented
any
execution
and
at
last
they
ceased
firing
waiting
till
a
breeze
should
spring
up
which
might
enable
them
to
renew
the
contest
with
better
success
at
this
time
it
was
about
eleven
in
the
forenoon
and
the
combat
had
lasted
about
five
hours
we
refreshed
ourselves
after
the
fatigue
and
exertion
which
we
had
undergone
and
made
every
preparation
for
a
renewal
of
the
fight
during
the
engagement
we
were
so
excited
that
we
had
no
time
to
think
but
now
that
we
were
cool
again
and
unoccupied
we
had
time
to
reflect
upon
our
position
and
we
began
to
feel
dejected
and
apprehensive
fatigued
with
exertion
we
were
weak
and
dispirited
we
knew
that
our
best
men
were
slain
or
groaning
under
their
severe
wounds
that
the
enemy
were
still
numerous
and
as
they
persevered
after
so
dreadful
a
slaughter
that
they
were
of
unquestionable
bravery
and
resolution
good
fortune
and
our
captain
superior
seamanship
had
up
to
the
present
enabled
us
to
make
a
good
fight
but
fortune
might
desert
us
and
our
numbers
were
so
reduced
that
if
the
enemy
continued
resolute
we
must
be
overpowered
our
gallant
captain
perceived
the
despondency
that
prevailed
and
endeavoured
to
remove
it
by
his
own
example
and
by
persuasion
after
praising
us
for
the
resolution
and
courage
we
had
already
shown
he
pointed
out
to
us
that
whatever
might
be
the
gallantry
of
the
officers
it
was
clear
that
the
men
on
board
of
the
opposing
vessels
were
awed
by
their
heavy
loss
and
want
of
success
and
that
if
they
made
one
more
attempt
to
take
us
by
the
board
and
failed
which
he
trusted
they
would
do
no
persuasion
would
ever
induce
them
to
try
it
again
and
the
captains
of
the
vessels
would
give
over
such
an
unprofitable
combat
he
solemnly
averred
that
the
colours
should
never
be
struck
while
he
survived
and
demanded
who
amongst
us
were
base
enough
to
refuse
to
stand
by
them
again
we
gave
him
three
cheers
but
our
numbers
were
few
and
the
cheers
were
faint
compared
with
the
first
which
had
been
given
but
still
we
were
resolute
and
determined
to
support
our
captain
and
the
honour
of
our
flag
captain
weatherall
took
care
that
this
feeling
should
not
subside
he
distributed
the
grog
plentifully
at
our
desire
he
nailed
the
colours
to
the
mast
and
we
waited
for
a
renewal
of
the
combat
with
impatience
at
four
in
the
afternoon
a
breeze
sprang
up
and
both
vessels
trimmed
their
sails
and
neared
us
fast
not
quite
in
such
gallant
trim
as
in
the
morning
it
is
true
but
they
appeared
now
to
have
summoned
up
a
determined
resolution
silently
they
came
up
forcing
their
way
slowly
through
the
water
not
a
gun
was
fired
but
the
gaping
mouths
of
the
cannon
and
their
men
motionless
at
their
quarters
portended
the
severity
of
the
struggle
which
was
now
to
decide
this
hitherto
trial
for
victory
when
within
half
a
cable
length
we
saluted
them
with
three
cheers
they
returned
our
defiance
and
running
up
on
each
side
of
us
the
combat
was
renewed
with
bitterness
the
frenchman
would
not
this
time
lay
us
on
board
until
he
was
certain
that
the
spaniard
had
boarded
us
to
leeward
he
continued
luffing
to
windward
and
plying
us
with
broadsides
until
we
were
grappled
with
the
spaniard
and
then
he
bore
down
and
laid
his
gunwale
on
our
bow
the
spaniard
had
already
boarded
us
on
the
quarter
and
we
were
repelling
this
attack
when
the
frenchman
laid
us
on
the
bow
we
fought
with
desperation
and
our
pikes
gave
us
such
an
advantage
over
the
swords
and
knives
of
the
spaniards
that
they
gave
ground
and
appalled
by
the
desperate
resistance
they
encountered
quitted
our
decks
strewed
with
their
dead
and
dying
shipmates
and
retreated
in
confusion
to
their
own
vessel
but
before
this
repulse
had
been
effected
the
french
had
boarded
us
on
the
and
driving
before
them
the
few
men
who
had
been
sent
forward
to
resist
them
had
gained
our
main
deck
and
forced
their
way
to
the
rise
of
the
where
all
our
remaining
men
were
now
collected
the
combat
was
now
desperate
but
after
a
time
our
pikes
and
the
advantage
of
our
position
appeared
to
prevail
over
numbers
we
drove
them
before
us
we
had
regained
the
main
deck
when
our
brave
commander
who
was
at
our
head
and
who
had
infused
spirit
into
us
all
received
a
bullet
through
his
right
wrist
shifting
his
sword
into
his
left
hand
he
still
pressed
forward
encouraging
us
when
a
ball
entered
his
breast
and
he
dropped
dead
with
his
fall
fell
the
courage
and
fortitude
of
his
crew
so
long
sustained
and
to
complete
the
mischief
the
lieutenant
and
two
remaining
officers
also
fell
a
few
seconds
after
him
astonished
and
terrified
the
men
stopped
short
in
their
career
of
success
and
wildly
looked
round
for
a
leader
the
french
who
had
retreated
to
the
forecastle
perceiving
our
confusion
i
renewed
the
attack
our
few
remaining
men
were
seized
with
a
panic
and
throwing
down
our
arms
we
asked
for
quarter
where
a
moment
before
victory
was
in
our
hands
such
was
the
finale
of
our
bloody
drama
out
of
men
had
been
killed
in
this
murderous
conflict
and
almost
all
the
survivors
desperately
or
severely
wounded
most
of
the
remaining
crew
after
we
had
cried
for
quarter
jumped
down
the
hatchway
to
avoid
the
cutlasses
of
their
enraged
victors
i
and
about
eight
others
having
been
driven
past
the
hatchway
threw
down
our
arms
and
begged
for
quarter
which
we
had
little
reason
to
expect
would
be
shown
to
us
at
first
no
quarter
was
given
by
our
savage
enemies
who
cut
down
several
of
our
disarmed
men
and
hacked
them
to
pieces
perceiving
this
i
got
on
the
gunwale
ready
to
jump
overboard
in
the
hopes
of
being
taken
up
after
the
slaughter
had
ceased
when
a
french
lieutenant
coming
up
protected
us
and
saved
the
poor
remains
of
our
crew
from
the
fury
of
his
men
our
lives
however
were
all
he
counted
upon
preserving
we
were
instantly
stripped
and
plundered
without
mercy
i
lost
everything
i
possessed
the
watch
ring
and
sword
i
had
taken
from
the
gallant
frenchman
were
soon
forced
from
me
and
not
stripping
off
my
apparel
fast
enough
to
please
a
mulatto
sailor
i
received
a
blow
with
the
of
a
pistol
under
the
left
ear
which
precipitated
me
down
the
hatchway
near
which
i
was
standing
and
i
fell
senseless
into
the
hold
chapter
three
we
are
sent
in
on
board
the
revenge
and
treated
with
great
cruelty
are
afterwards
recaptured
by
the
hero
privateer
and
retaliate
on
the
french
i
am
taken
to
the
hospital
at
port
royal
where
i
meet
the
french
lady
her
savage
exultation
at
my
condition
she
is
punished
by
one
of
my
comrades
on
coming
to
my
senses
i
found
myself
stripped
naked
and
suffering
acute
pain
i
found
that
my
right
arm
was
broken
my
shoulder
severely
injured
by
my
fall
and
as
i
had
received
three
severe
during
the
action
i
had
lost
so
much
blood
that
i
had
not
strength
to
rise
or
do
anything
for
myself
there
i
lay
groaning
and
naked
upon
the
ballast
of
the
vessel
at
times
ruminating
upon
the
events
of
the
action
upon
the
death
of
our
gallant
commander
upon
the
loss
of
our
vessel
of
so
many
of
our
comrades
and
of
our
liberty
after
some
time
the
surgeon
by
order
of
the
french
commander
came
down
to
dress
my
wounds
he
treated
me
with
the
greatest
barbarity
as
he
twisted
about
my
broken
limb
i
could
not
help
crying
at
the
anguish
which
he
caused
me
he
compelled
me
to
silence
by
blows
and
maledictions
wishing
i
had
broken
my
rascally
neck
rather
than
he
should
have
been
put
to
the
trouble
of
coming
down
to
dress
me
however
dress
me
he
did
out
of
fear
of
his
captain
who
he
knew
well
would
send
round
to
see
if
he
had
executed
his
orders
and
then
he
left
me
with
a
kick
in
the
ribs
by
way
of
remembrance
shortly
afterwards
the
vessels
separated
fourteen
of
us
who
were
the
most
severely
hurt
were
left
in
the
revenge
which
was
manned
by
an
officer
and
twenty
frenchmen
with
orders
to
take
her
into
the
rest
of
our
men
were
put
on
board
of
the
french
privateer
who
sailed
away
in
search
of
a
more
profitable
adventure
about
an
hour
after
they
had
made
sail
on
the
vessel
the
officer
who
had
charge
of
her
looking
down
the
hatchway
and
perceiving
my
naked
and
forlorn
condition
threw
me
a
pair
of
trousers
which
had
been
rejected
by
the
french
seamen
as
not
worth
having
and
a
check
shirt
in
an
equally
ragged
condition
i
picked
up
in
the
hold
this
with
a
piece
of
old
rope
to
tie
round
my
neck
as
a
sling
for
my
broken
arm
was
my
whole
wardrobe
in
the
evening
i
gained
the
deck
that
i
might
be
refreshed
by
the
breeze
which
cooled
my
feverish
body
and
somewhat
restored
me
we
remained
in
this
condition
for
several
days
tortured
with
pain
but
more
tortured
perhaps
by
the
insolence
and
bragging
of
the
frenchmen
who
set
no
bounds
to
their
triumph
and
among
those
who
had
charge
of
the
prize
were
two
one
of
whom
had
my
watch
and
the
other
my
ring
the
first
would
hold
it
to
me
grinning
and
asking
if
monsieur
would
like
to
know
what
it
was
and
the
other
would
display
the
ring
and
tell
me
that
his
sweetheart
would
value
it
when
she
knew
it
was
taken
from
a
conquered
englishman
this
was
their
practice
every
day
and
i
was
compelled
to
receive
their
gibes
without
venturing
a
retort
on
the
eleventh
day
after
our
capture
when
close
to
and
expecting
we
should
be
at
anchor
before
nightfall
we
perceived
a
great
hurry
and
confusion
on
deck
they
were
evidently
making
all
the
sail
that
they
could
upon
the
vessel
and
then
hearing
them
fire
off
their
we
knew
for
certain
that
they
were
pursued
overjoyed
at
the
prospect
of
being
released
we
gave
three
cheers
the
french
from
the
deck
threatened
to
fire
down
upon
us
but
we
knew
that
they
dared
not
for
the
revenge
was
so
crippled
in
the
fight
that
they
could
not
put
sail
upon
her
so
as
to
escape
and
their
force
on
board
was
too
small
to
enable
them
to
resist
if
overtaken
we
therefore
continued
our
exulting
clamours
at
last
we
heard
guns
fired
and
the
shot
whizzing
over
the
vessel
a
shot
or
two
struck
our
bull
and
soon
afterwards
a
broadside
being
poured
into
us
the
frenchmen
struck
their
colours
and
we
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
all
these
gasconaders
driven
down
into
the
hold
to
take
our
places
it
was
now
their
turn
to
be
dejected
and
downcast
and
for
us
to
be
merry
and
now
also
the
tables
had
to
be
turned
and
we
took
the
liberty
of
regaining
possession
of
our
clothes
and
other
property
which
they
carried
on
their
backs
and
in
their
pockets
i
must
say
we
showed
them
no
mercy
what
is
it
monsieur
said
i
to
the
fellow
who
had
my
watch
at
your
service
sir
he
replied
humbly
taking
out
my
watch
and
presenting
it
to
me
thank
you
said
i
taking
the
watch
and
saluting
him
with
a
kick
in
the
stomach
which
made
him
double
up
and
turn
round
from
me
upon
which
i
gave
him
another
kick
in
the
rear
to
straighten
him
again
that
ring
monsieur
that
your
sweetheart
will
prize
here
it
is
replied
the
fellow
abjectly
thank
you
sir
i
replied
saluting
him
with
the
double
kick
which
i
had
given
to
the
former
tell
your
sweetheart
i
sent
her
those
cried
i
that
is
when
you
get
back
to
her
hark
ye
brother
cries
one
of
our
men
i
trouble
you
for
that
jacket
which
you
borrowed
of
me
the
other
day
and
in
return
here
are
a
pair
of
iron
garters
holding
out
the
shackles
which
you
must
wear
for
my
sake
i
think
they
will
fit
you
well
mounseer
cries
another
that
wig
of
mine
do
suit
your
complexion
i
trouble
you
for
it
it
a
pity
such
a
face
as
yours
should
be
disfigured
in
those
curls
and
while
you
are
about
it
i
thank
you
to
strip
altogether
as
i
think
your
clothes
will
fit
me
and
are
much
too
gay
for
a
prisoner
i
was
left
naked
through
your
kindness
the
other
day
said
i
to
another
who
was
well
and
smartly
dressed
i
thank
you
to
strip
to
your
skin
or
you
shall
have
no
skin
left
and
i
commenced
with
my
knife
cutting
his
ears
as
if
i
would
skin
them
it
was
a
lucky
hit
of
mine
for
in
his
sash
i
found
about
twenty
doubloons
he
would
have
saved
them
and
held
them
tight
but
after
my
knife
had
entered
his
side
about
half
an
inch
he
surrendered
the
prize
after
we
had
plundered
and
stripped
them
of
everything
we
set
to
to
kick
them
and
we
did
it
for
half
an
hour
so
effectually
that
they
were
all
left
groaning
in
a
heap
on
the
ballast
and
we
then
found
our
way
on
deck
the
privateer
which
had
recaptured
us
proved
to
be
the
hero
of
new
providence
the
frenchmen
were
taken
out
and
some
of
her
own
men
put
in
to
take
us
to
port
royal
we
being
wounded
and
not
willing
to
join
her
remained
on
board
on
our
arrival
at
port
royal
we
obtained
permission
to
go
to
the
king
hospital
to
be
cured
as
i
went
to
the
ward
allotted
to
me
i
met
the
french
lady
whose
husband
had
been
killed
and
who
was
still
nursing
her
son
at
the
hospital
his
wounds
not
having
been
yet
cured
notwithstanding
my
altered
appearance
she
knew
me
again
immediately
and
seeing
me
pale
and
emaciated
with
my
arm
in
a
sling
she
dropped
down
on
her
knees
and
thanked
god
for
returning
upon
our
heads
a
portion
of
the
miseries
we
had
brought
upon
her
she
was
delighted
when
she
heard
how
many
of
us
had
been
slain
in
the
murderous
conflict
and
even
rejoiced
at
the
death
of
poor
captain
weatherall
which
considering
how
very
kind
and
considerate
he
had
been
to
her
i
thought
to
be
very
unchristian
it
so
happened
that
i
was
not
only
in
the
same
ward
but
in
the
cradle
next
to
her
son
and
the
excitement
i
had
been
under
when
we
were
recaptured
and
my
exertion
in
kicking
the
frenchmen
had
done
me
no
good
a
fever
was
the
consequence
and
i
suffered
dreadfully
and
she
would
look
at
me
exulting
in
my
agony
and
mocking
my
groans
till
at
last
the
surgeon
told
her
it
was
by
extreme
favour
that
her
son
had
been
admitted
into
the
hospital
instead
of
being
sent
to
prison
and
that
if
she
did
not
behave
herself
in
a
proper
manner
he
would
order
her
to
be
denied
admittance
altogether
and
that
if
she
dared
to
torment
suffering
men
in
that
way
on
the
first
complaint
on
my
part
her
son
should
go
to
the
gaol
and
finish
his
cure
there
this
brought
her
to
her
senses
and
she
begged
pardon
and
promised
to
offend
no
more
but
she
did
not
keep
her
word
for
more
than
a
day
or
two
but
laughed
out
loud
when
the
surgeon
was
dressing
my
arm
for
a
piece
of
bone
had
to
be
taken
out
and
i
shrieked
with
anguish
this
exasperated
one
of
my
messmates
so
much
that
not
choosing
to
strike
her
and
knowing
how
to
wound
her
still
worse
he
drove
his
fist
into
the
head
of
her
son
as
he
lay
in
his
cradle
and
by
so
doing
reopened
the
wound
that
had
been
nearly
healed
there
pain
for
you
to
laugh
at
you
french
devil
he
cried
and
sure
enough
it
cost
the
poor
young
man
his
life
the
surgeon
was
very
angry
with
the
man
but
told
the
french
lady
as
she
kneeled
sobbing
by
the
side
of
her
son
that
she
had
brought
it
upon
herself
and
him
by
her
own
folly
and
cruelty
i
know
not
whether
she
felt
so
or
whether
she
dreaded
a
repetition
but
this
is
certain
she
tormented
me
no
more
on
the
contrary
i
think
she
suffered
very
severely
as
she
perceived
that
i
rapidly
mended
and
that
her
poor
son
got
on
but
slowly
at
last
my
hurts
were
all
healed
and
i
left
the
hospital
hoping
never
to
see
her
more

for
the
coast
of
africa
arrive
off
senegal
a
great
deal
of
being
due
to
us
i
called
upon
the
agent
at
port
royal
to
obtain
an
advance
i
found
him
in
a
puzzle
owing
to
the
death
of
captain
weatherall
and
so
many
of
the
officers
he
hardly
knew
whether
those
who
applied
to
him
were
entitled
to
or
not
whether
he
thought
i
appeared
more
honest
than
the
others
or
from
what
cause
i
know
not
he
requested
me
as
i
knew
everything
that
had
passed
to
remain
with
him
for
a
short
time
and
finding
that
i
could
read
and
write
well
he
obtained
from
me
correct
lists
of
the
privateer
crew
with
those
who
were
killed
and
on
what
occasion
all
this
information
i
was
able
to
give
him
as
well
as
the
ratings
of
the
parties
for
on
more
than
one
occasion
the
had
come
to
him
representing
themselves
as
petty
officers
when
they
were
only
common
seamen
on
board
and
had
in
consequence
received
from
him
a
larger
advance
than
they
were
entitled
to
as
soon
as
his
accounts
were
pretty
well
made
up
he
asked
me
whether
i
intended
to
go
to
england
as
if
so
he
would
send
me
home
with
all
the
papers
and
documents
to
the
owner
at
liverpool
who
would
require
my
assistance
to
arrange
the
accounts
and
as
i
had
had
quite
enough
of
privateering
for
a
time
i
consented
to
go
about
two
months
after
leaving
the
hospital
during
which
i
had
passed
a
very
pleasant
life
and
quite
recovered
from
my
wounds
and
injuries
i
sailed
for
liverpool
in
the
sally
and
kitty
commanded
by
captain
clarke
a
very
violent
man
we
had
not
sailed
twelve
hours
before
we
fell
in
with
a
gale
which
lasted
several
days
and
we
kept
under
and
the
gale
lasting
a
week
raised
a
mountainous
swell
but
it
was
very
long
and
regular
on
the
seventh
day
the
wind
abated
but
the
swell
continued
and
at
evening
there
was
very
little
wind
when
a
circumstance
occurred
which
had
nearly
cost
me
my
life
as
you
will
acknowledge
madam
when
i
relate
the
story
to
you
during
the
between
six
and
eight
some
hands
being
employed
in
the
foretop
the
other
watch
below
at
supper
and
the
captain
and
all
the
officers
in
the
cabin
i
being
at
the
helm
heard
a
voice
apparently
rising
out
of
the
sea
calling
me
by
name
surprised
i
ran
to
the
side
of
the
ship
and
saw
a
youth
named
richard
pallant
in
the
water
going
astern
he
had
fallen
out
of
the
forechains
and
knowing
that
i
was
at
the
helm
had
shouted
to
me
for
help
i
immediately
called
all
hands
crying
a
man
overboard
the
captain
hastened
on
deck
with
all
the
others
and
ordered
the
helm
the
ship
went
about
and
then
fell
round
off
driving
fast
before
the
swell
till
at
last
we
brought
her
to
the
captain
although
a
resolute
man
was
much
confused
and
perplexed
at
the
boy
danger
for
his
friends
were
people
of
property
at
ipswich
and
had
confided
the
boy
to
his
particular
care
he
ran
backwards
and
forwards
crying
out
that
the
boy
must
perish
as
the
swell
was
so
high
that
he
dared
not
send
a
boat
for
the
boat
could
not
live
in
such
a
sea
and
if
the
boat
were
lost
with
the
crew
there
would
not
be
hands
enow
left
on
board
to
take
the
vessel
home
as
the
youth
was
not
a
hundred
yards
from
the
vessel
i
stated
the
possibility
of
swimming
to
him
with
the
line
which
would
be
strong
enough
to
haul
both
him
and
the
man
who
swam
to
him
on
board
captain
clarke
in
a
great
rage
swore
that
it
was
impossible
and
asked
me
who
the
devil
would
go
piqued
at
his
answer
and
anxious
to
preserve
the
life
of
the
youth
i
offered
to
try
it
myself
i
stripped
and
making
the
line
fast
round
my
body
plunged
from
the
ship
side
into
the
sea
it
was
a
new
line
and
stiff
in
the
coil
so
that
not
drawing
close
round
me
it
slipped
and
i
swam
through
it
but
catching
it
as
it
slipped
over
my
feet
i
made
it
secure
by
putting
my
head
and
one
arm
through
the
noose
i
swam
direct
for
the
boy
and
found
that
i
swam
with
ease
owing
to
the
strength
and
buoyant
nature
of
the
water
in
those
latitudes
i
had
not
swum
more
than
before
the
line
got
foul
on
the
coil
on
board
and
checking
me
suddenly
it
pulled
me
backwards
and
under
water
i
recovered
myself
and
struck
out
again
during
this
time
to
clear
the
line
on
board
they
had
cut
some
of
the
entangled
parts
and
in
the
confusion
and
hurry
severed
the
wrong
part
so
that
the
end
went
overboard
and
i
had
half
the
coil
of
line
hanging
to
me
and
at
the
same
time
was
adrift
from
the
ship
they
immediately
hailed
me
to
return
but
from
the
booming
of
the
waves
i
could
not
hear
what
they
said
and
thought
that
they
were
encouraging
me
to
proceed
i
shouted
in
return
to
show
the
confidence
which
i
had
in
myself
i
easily
mounted
the
waves
as
they
breasted
me
but
still
i
made
my
way
very
slowly
against
such
a
swell
and
saw
the
boy
only
at
intervals
when
i
was
on
the
top
of
the
wave
he
could
swim
very
little
and
did
not
make
for
the
ship
but
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
sky
paddled
like
a
dog
to
keep
himself
above
water
i
now
began
to
feel
the
weight
of
the
line
upon
me
and
to
fear
that
i
should
never
hold
out
i
began
to
repent
of
my
rashness
and
thought
i
had
only
sacrificed
myself
without
any
chance
of
saving
him
i
persevered
nevertheless
and
having
as
i
guessed
come
to
the
spot
where
the
boy
was
i
looked
round
and
not
seeing
him
was
afraid
that
he
had
gone
down
but
on
mounting
the
next
wave
i
saw
him
in
the
hollow
struggling
hard
to
keep
above
water
and
almost
spent
with
his
long
exertion
i
swam
down
to
him
and
hailing
him
found
he
was
still
sensible
but
utterly
exhausted
i
desired
him
to
hold
on
by
my
hand
but
not
to
touch
my
body
as
we
should
both
sink
he
promised
to
obey
me
and
i
held
out
my
right
hand
to
him
and
made
a
signal
for
them
to
haul
in
on
board
for
i
had
no
idea
that
the
line
had
been
cut
i
was
frightened
when
i
perceived
the
distance
that
the
ship
was
from
me
at
least
a
quarter
of
a
mile
i
knew
that
the
line
was
but
a
hundred
fathoms
in
length
and
therefore
that
i
must
be
adrift
and
my
heart
sunk
within
me
all
the
horrors
of
my
situation
came
upon
me
and
i
felt
that
i
was
lost
but
although
death
appeared
inevitable
i
still
struggled
for
life
but
the
rope
now
weighed
me
down
more
and
more
while
swimming
forward
it
trailed
behind
and
although
it
impeded
my
way
i
did
not
feel
half
its
weight
now
however
that
i
was
stationary
it
sank
deep
and
pulled
me
down
with
it
the
waves
too
which
while
i
breasted
them
and
saw
them
approach
i
easily
rose
over
being
now
behind
us
broke
over
our
heads
burying
us
under
them
or
rolling
us
over
by
their
force
i
tried
to
disengage
myself
from
the
line
but
the
noose
being
jammed
and
having
the
boy
in
one
hand
i
could
not
possibly
effect
it
but
what
gave
me
courage
in
my
difficulties
was
that
i
perceived
that
the
people
on
board
were
getting
out
the
boat
for
although
the
captain
would
not
run
the
risk
for
one
person
now
that
two
were
overboard
and
one
of
them
risking
his
life
for
the
other
the
men
insisted
that
the
boat
should
be
hoisted
out
it
was
an
anxious
time
to
me
but
at
last
i
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
her
clear
of
the
ship
and
pulling
round
her
bow
the
danger
was
however
considered
so
great
that
when
they
came
to
man
the
boat
only
three
men
could
be
found
who
would
go
in
her
and
in
the
confusion
they
came
away
with
but
two
oars
and
no
rudder
under
these
disadvantages
they
of
course
pulled
very
slowly
against
a
mountainous
sea
as
they
were
obliged
to
steer
with
the
oars
to
meet
it
that
the
boat
might
not
be
swamped
but
the
sight
of
the
boat
was
sufficient
to
keep
me
up
my
exertions
were
certainly
incredible
but
what
will
not
a
man
do
when
in
fear
of
death
as
it
approached
slowly
and
slowly
did
my
powers
decrease
i
was
now
often
under
water
with
the
boy
and
rose
again
to
fresh
exertion
when
at
last
a
crested
wave
broke
over
us
and
down
we
went
several
feet
under
the
water
the
force
of
the
sea
drove
the
boy
against
me
and
he
seized
me
by
the
loins
with
my
head
downwards
i
struggled
to
disengage
myself
it
was
impossible
i
gave
myself
up
for
lost
and
what
a
crowd
of
thoughts
and
memories
passed
through
my
brain
in
a
few
moments
for
it
could
not
have
been
longer
at
last
being
head
downwards
i
dived
deeper
although
i
was
bursting
from
so
long
holding
my
breath
under
water
this
had
the
desired
effect
finding
me
sinking
instead
of
rising
with
him
the
boy
let
go
his
hold
that
he
might
gain
the
surface
i
turned
and
followed
him
and
drew
breath
once
more
another
moment
had
sealed
our
fates
i
no
longer
thought
of
saving
the
boy
but
struck
out
for
the
boat
which
was
now
near
me
perceiving
this
the
boy
cried
out
to
me
for
pity
sake
not
to
leave
him
i
felt
myself
so
far
recovered
from
my
exhaustion
that
i
thought
i
could
save
him
as
well
as
myself
and
compassion
induced
me
to
turn
back
i
again
gave
him
my
hand
charging
him
on
his
life
not
to
attempt
to
grapple
with
me
and
again
resumed
the
arduous
struggle
of
keeping
him
as
well
as
myself
above
water
my
strength
was
nearly
gone
the
boat
approached
but
slowly
and
we
now
sunk
constantly
under
the
water
rising
every
few
seconds
to
draw
breath
merciful
god
how
slow
appeared
the
approach
of
the
boat
struggle
after
struggle
fainter
and
fainter
still
still
i
floated
at
last
my
senses
almost
left
me
i
took
in
water
in
quantities
i
felt
i
was
in
green
fields
when
i
was
seized
by
the
men
and
thrown
into
the
bottom
of
the
boat
where
i
lay
senseless
alongside
of
the
boy
there
was
great
danger
and
difficulty
in
getting
again
to
the
ship
more
than
once
the
boat
was
half
filled
by
the
following
seas
and
when
they
gained
the
ship
it
was
impossible
to
get
us
out
as
had
they
approached
the
side
the
boat
would
have
been
dashed
to
atoms
they
lowered
the
tackles
from
the
the
three
men
clambered
up
them
leaving
us
to
take
our
chance
of
the
boat
being
got
in
or
her
being
stove
to
pieces
in
which
latter
case
we
should
have
been
lost
they
did
get
us
in
with
great
damage
to
the
boat
but
we
were
saved
the
line
was
still
round
me
and
it
was
found
that
i
had
been
supporting
the
weight
of
seventy
yards
so
sore
was
i
with
such
exertion
that
i
kept
my
hammock
for
many
days
during
which
i
reviewed
my
past
life
and
vowed
amendment
we
arrived
at
liverpool
without
any
further
adventure
worth
recording
and
i
immediately
called
upon
the
owner
with
the
papers
intrusted
to
me
i
gave
him
all
the
information
he
required
and
he
asked
me
whether
i
should
like
to
return
to
privateering
or
to
go
as
mate
of
a
vessel
bound
to
the
coast
of
africa
i
inquired
what
her
destination
was
to
be
and
as
i
found
that
she
was
to
go
to
senegal
for
ivory
wax
and
other
articles
in
exchange
for
english
prints
and
cutlery
i
consented
i
mention
this
as
had
she
been
employed
in
the
as
were
most
of
the
vessels
from
liverpool
to
the
coast
i
would
not
have
joined
her
a
few
days
afterwards
i
went
on
board
of
the
dalrymple
captain
jones
as
mate
we
had
a
very
quick
passage
to
senegal
and
brought
our
vessel
to
an
anchor
off
the
bar
chapter
five
in
crossing
the
bar
at
senegal
the
boat
is
upset
by
a
tornado
we
escape
being
devoured
by
sharks
only
to
be
captured
by
the
natives
are
taken
into
the
interior
of
the
country
and
brought
before
the
negro
king
from
whose
wrath
we
are
saved
by
the
intercession
of
his
female
attendants
a
day
or
two
after
we
had
arrived
the
master
of
another
vessel
that
was
at
anchor
near
to
us
came
on
board
and
borrowed
our
and
some
hands
that
he
might
go
in
it
to
senegal
the
captain
who
was
an
old
friend
of
the
party
who
made
the
request
agreed
to
lend
it
to
him
and
as
accidents
are
very
frequent
with
boats
crossing
the
bar
on
account
of
the
heavy
breakers
the
best
swimmers
were
selected
for
the
purpose
and
the
charge
of
the
boat
was
given
to
me
we
set
off
five
men
rowing
and
i
at
the
helm
when
we
approached
the
bar
a
tornado
which
had
been
for
some
time
threatening
came
upon
us
the
impetuosity
of
these
blasts
is
to
be
matched
in
no
part
of
the
world
and
as
it
came
at
once
in
its
full
force
we
endeavoured
by
putting
the
boat
before
it
to
escape
its
fury
this
compelled
us
to
run
to
the
southward
along
the
coast
we
managed
to
keep
the
boat
up
for
a
long
while
and
hoped
to
have
weathered
it
when
being
on
the
bar
and
in
broken
water
a
large
wave
curled
over
us
filled
the
boat
and
it
went
down
in
an
instant
our
only
chance
now
was
to
reach
the
shore
by
swimming
but
it
was
at
a
distance
with
broken
water
the
whole
way
and
our
great
terror
was
from
the
sharks
which
abound
on
the
coast
and
are
extremely
ravenous
nor
were
we
without
reason
for
our
alarm
scarcely
had
the
boat
gone
down
and
we
were
all
stretching
out
for
the
shore
when
one
of
our
men
shrieked
having
been
seized
by
the
sharks
and
instantly
torn
to
pieces
his
blood
stained
the
water
all
around
and
this
attracting
all
the
sharks
proved
the
means
of
our
escape
never
shall
i
forget
the
horrible
sensation
which
i
felt
as
i
struggled
through
the
broken
water
expecting
every
minute
a
limb
to
be
taken
off
by
one
of
those
voracious
animals
if
one
foot
touched
the
other
my
heart
sunk
thinking
it
was
the
nose
of
a
shark
and
that
its
bite
would
immediately
follow
agonised
with
these
terrors
we
struggled
on
now
a
large
wave
curling
over
us
and
burying
us
under
water
or
now
forced
by
the
waves
towards
the
beach
rolling
us
over
and
over
so
battered
were
we
by
the
surf
that
we
dived
under
the
waves
to
escape
the
blows
which
we
received
and
then
rose
and
struck
out
again
at
last
worn
out
with
exertion
we
gained
the
shore
but
our
toil
was
not
over
the
beach
was
of
a
sand
so
light
that
it
crumbled
beneath
us
and
at
the
return
of
the
wave
which
threw
us
on
shore
we
were
dragged
back
again
and
buried
in
sand
and
water
we
rose
to
renew
our
endeavours
but
several
times
without
success
for
we
could
not
obtain
a
firm
footing
at
last
the
negroes
who
had
witnessed
our
accident
and
who
now
came
down
in
great
numbers
on
the
beach
laid
hold
of
us
as
the
sea
threw
us
up
and
dragged
us
beyond
the
reach
of
the
waves
worn
out
with
fatigue
we
lay
on
the
sand
waiting
to
ascertain
what
the
savages
would
do
with
us
they
were
not
long
in
letting
us
know
for
they
soon
began
to
strip
us
of
every
article
of
clothing
on
our
backs
one
of
our
men
attempted
to
resist
upon
which
a
negro
drove
a
spear
through
his
thigh
having
divided
our
apparel
after
some
consultation
they
tied
our
hands
and
placing
us
in
the
midst
of
a
large
force
armed
with
spears
and
bows
and
arrows
they
went
off
with
us
for
the
inland
part
of
the
country
we
set
off
with
heavy
hearts
taking
as
we
thought
a
last
farewell
of
the
ocean
and
going
forwards
in
great
apprehension
of
the
fate
that
awaited
us
the
sand
was
very
deep
and
the
heat
of
the
sun
excessive
for
it
was
then
about
noon
without
any
garments
we
were
soon
scorched
and
blistered
all
over
and
in
intolerable
anguish
as
well
as
fatigued
but
the
negroes
compelled
us
to
move
on
goading
us
with
their
spears
if
we
slackened
our
pace
and
threatening
to
run
us
through
if
we
made
a
halt
we
longed
for
the
night
as
it
would
afford
a
temporary
relief
to
our
sufferings
it
came
at
last
and
the
negroes
collected
wood
and
lighted
a
fire
to
keep
off
the
wild
beasts
lying
round
it
in
a
circle
and
placing
us
in
the
midst
of
them
we
hoped
to
have
some
rest
after
what
we
had
gone
through
but
it
was
impossible
the
night
proved
even
worse
than
the
day
the
mosquitoes
came
down
upon
us
in
such
swarms
and
their
bites
were
so
intolerable
that
we
were
almost
frantic
our
hands
being
tied
we
could
not
beat
them
off
and
we
rolled
over
and
over
to
get
rid
of
them
this
made
matters
worse
for
our
whole
bodies
being
covered
with
raised
blisters
from
the
rays
of
the
sun
our
rolling
over
and
over
broke
the
blisters
and
the
sand
getting
into
the
wounds
added
to
the
bites
of
the
mosquitoes
made
our
sufferings
intolerable
we
had
before
prayed
for
night
we
now
prayed
for
day
some
prayed
for
death
when
the
sun
rose
we
set
off
again
our
conductors
utterly
disregarding
our
anguish
and
goading
us
on
as
before
in
the
forenoon
we
arrived
at
a
village
where
our
guards
refreshed
themselves
a
very
small
quantity
of
boiled
corn
was
given
to
each
of
us
and
we
continued
our
journey
passing
by
several
small
towns
consisting
as
they
all
do
in
that
country
of
huts
built
of
reeds
round
in
form
and
gathered
to
a
point
at
top
this
day
was
the
same
as
the
preceding
we
were
pricked
with
spears
if
we
stumbled
or
lagged
threatened
with
death
if
we
had
not
strength
to
go
on
at
last
the
evening
arrived
and
the
fires
were
lighted
the
fires
were
much
larger
than
before
i
presume
because
the
wild
beasts
were
more
numerous
for
we
heard
them
howling
in
every
direction
round
us
which
we
had
not
done
on
the
night
before
the
mosquitoes
did
not
annoy
us
so
much
and
we
obtained
some
intervals
of
broken
rest
at
daylight
we
resumed
our
journey
as
near
as
we
could
judge
by
the
sun
in
a
more
easterly
direction
during
the
first
two
days
we
were
badly
received
by
the
inhabitants
of
the
towns
whose
people
had
been
kidnapped
so
often
for
the
they
hated
the
sight
of
our
white
faces
for
they
presumed
that
we
had
come
for
that
purpose
but
as
we
advanced
in
the
interior
we
were
better
treated
and
the
natives
looked
upon
us
with
surprise
and
wonder
considering
us
as
a
new
race
of
beings
some
of
the
women
seeing
how
utterly
exhausted
we
were
with
fatigue
and
hunger
looked
with
compassion
on
us
and
brought
us
plenty
of
boiled
corn
and
goats
milk
to
drink
this
refreshed
us
greatly
and
we
continued
our
journey
in
anxious
expectation
of
the
fate
for
which
we
were
reserved
on
crossing
a
small
river
which
appeared
to
be
the
boundary
of
two
different
states
a
multitude
of
negroes
approached
and
seemed
disposed
to
take
us
from
our
present
masters
but
after
a
conference
they
agreed
among
themselves
and
a
party
of
them
joined
with
those
who
had
previously
conducted
us
we
soon
came
to
the
edge
of
a
desert
and
there
we
halted
till
the
negroes
had
filled
several
calabashes
and
gourds
full
of
water
and
collected
a
quantity
of
boiled
corn
as
soon
as
this
was
done
we
set
off
again
and
entered
the
desert
we
were
astonished
and
terrified
when
we
looked
around
us
not
a
single
vestige
of
herbage
not
a
blade
of
grass
was
to
be
seen
all
was
one
wide
waste
of
barren
sand
so
light
as
to
rise
in
clouds
at
the
least
wind
and
we
sank
so
deep
in
walking
through
it
that
at
last
we
could
hardly
drag
one
foot
after
the
other
but
we
were
repaid
for
our
fatigue
for
when
we
halted
at
night
no
fires
were
lighted
and
to
our
great
delight
we
found
that
there
were
no
mosquitoes
to
annoy
us
we
fell
into
a
sound
sleep
which
lasted
till
morning
and
were
much
refreshed
indeed
so
much
so
as
to
enable
us
to
pursue
our
journey
with
alacrity
in
our
passage
over
the
desert
we
saw
numbers
of
elephants
teeth
but
no
animals
how
the
teeth
came
there
unless
it
were
that
the
elephants
were
lost
in
attempting
to
cross
the
desert
i
can
not
pretend
to
say
before
we
had
crossed
the
desert
our
water
was
expended
and
we
suffered
dreadfully
from
thirst
walking
as
we
did
during
the
whole
day
under
a
vertical
sun
the
night
was
equally
painful
as
we
were
so
tortured
with
the
want
of
water
but
on
the
following
day
when
our
strength
was
nearly
exhausted
and
we
were
debating
whether
we
should
not
lie
down
and
allow
the
spears
of
our
conductors
to
put
an
end
to
our
miseries
we
came
to
the
banks
of
a
river
which
the
negroes
had
evidently
been
anxiously
looking
for
here
we
drank
plentifully
and
remained
all
the
day
to
recruit
ourselves
for
the
negroes
were
almost
as
exhausted
as
we
were
the
next
morning
we
crossed
the
river
and
plunged
into
a
deep
wood
the
ground
being
high
the
mosquitoes
did
not
annoy
us
so
much
as
they
did
down
on
the
low
marshy
land
near
the
during
our
traverse
through
the
wood
we
subsisted
solely
upon
the
birds
and
animals
which
the
negroes
killed
with
their
bows
and
arrows
when
we
had
forced
our
way
through
the
forest
we
found
the
country
as
before
interspersed
with
wicker
villages
or
small
hamlets
at
a
few
miles
distance
from
each
other
round
each
village
there
were
small
patches
of
guinea
corn
and
we
frequently
came
to
clusters
of
huts
which
had
been
deserted
between
the
and
the
desert
we
had
traversed
we
observed
that
many
of
the
inhabitants
had
european
but
now
the
only
weapons
to
be
seen
were
spears
and
bows
and
arrows
as
we
advanced
we
were
surrounded
at
every
village
by
the
natives
who
looked
upon
us
with
surprise
and
astonishment
examining
us
and
evidently
considering
us
a
new
species
one
morning
we
arrived
at
a
very
large
negro
town
and
as
we
approached
our
guards
began
to
swell
with
pride
and
exultation
and
drove
us
before
them
among
the
crowds
of
inhabitants
singing
songs
of
triumph
and
brandishing
their
weapons
having
been
driven
through
a
great
part
of
the
town
we
arrived
at
a
number
of
huts
separated
by
a
high
palisade
from
the
rest
and
appropriated
as
we
afterwards
found
to
the
use
of
the
king
of
the
country
his
wives
and
attendants
here
we
waited
outside
some
time
while
our
guards
went
in
and
acquainted
this
royal
personage
with
the
present
which
they
had
brought
for
him
we
had
reason
to
think
that
our
captors
were
not
his
subjects
but
had
been
at
variance
with
him
and
had
brought
us
as
a
present
that
they
might
make
peace
with
an
enemy
too
strong
for
them
we
were
at
last
ordered
to
go
inside
the
enclosure
and
found
ourselves
in
a
large
open
building
constructed
like
the
others
of
reeds
and
boughs
in
the
centre
was
squatted
a
old
negro
attended
by
four
young
negro
women
he
was
and
lean
and
of
a
very
large
frame
a
diabolical
ferocity
was
imprinted
on
his
grim
countenance
and
as
he
moved
his
arms
and
legs
he
showed
that
under
his
loose
skin
there
was
a
muscle
of
extraordinary
power
i
never
had
before
seen
such
a
living
type
of
brutal
strength
and
barbarity
on
a
mat
before
him
were
provisions
of
different
kinds
behind
him
stood
several
grim
savages
who
held
his
weapons
and
on
each
side
at
a
greater
distance
were
rows
of
negroes
with
their
heads
bent
down
and
their
arms
crossed
awaiting
his
orders
the
chief
or
king
as
well
as
the
four
women
had
clothes
of
the
blue
cotton
cloth
of
the
country
that
is
one
piece
wrapped
round
the
loins
and
descending
to
the
ankles
and
another
worn
over
their
shoulders
but
with
few
exceptions
all
the
rest
as
well
as
the
inhabitants
generally
were
quite
naked
so
were
we
as
the
reader
may
recollect
round
the
necks
of
the
women
were
rows
of
gold
beads
longer
by
degrees
until
the
last
of
the
rows
hung
lower
than
their
bosoms
and
both
the
king
and
they
had
large
bracelets
of
gold
round
their
arms
wrists
and
legs
the
women
who
were
young
and
stared
at
us
with
eager
astonishment
while
the
old
king
scowled
upon
us
so
as
to
freeze
our
blood
at
last
rising
from
the
ground
he
took
his
sabre
from
the
man
who
held
it
behind
him
and
walked
up
among
us
who
with
our
heads
bowed
and
breathless
with
fear
awaited
our
impending
fate
i
happened
to
be
standing
the
foremost
and
grasping
my
arm
with
a
gripe
which
made
my
heart
sink
with
his
hand
which
held
the
sword
he
bent
down
my
head
still
lower
than
it
was
i
made
sure
that
he
was
about
to
cut
off
my
head
when
the
women
who
had
risen
from
the
ground
ran
crowding
round
him
and
with
mingled
entreaties
and
caresses
strove
to
induce
him
not
to
put
his
intentions
if
such
he
really
had
into
execution
they
prevailed
at
last
the
youngest
took
away
his
sword
and
then
they
led
him
back
to
his
seat
after
which
the
women
came
to
us
to
gratify
their
curiosity
they
felt
our
arms
and
breasts
putting
innumerable
questions
to
those
who
brought
us
thither
they
appeared
very
much
amazed
at
the
length
of
my
hair
for
i
had
worn
it
tied
in
a
long
cue
taking
hold
of
it
they
gave
it
two
or
three
severe
pulls
to
ascertain
if
it
really
grew
to
my
head
and
finding
that
it
did
so
they
expressed
much
wonder
when
their
curiosity
was
satisfied
they
then
appeared
to
consider
our
condition
and
having
obtained
the
old
permission
they
brought
us
a
calabash
full
of
that
is
guinea
corn
boiled
into
a
thick
paste
our
hands
being
still
tied
we
could
only
by
shaking
our
heads
express
our
inability
to
profit
by
their
kindness
understanding
what
we
meant
they
immediately
cut
our
thongs
and
the
youngest
of
the
four
perceiving
that
my
arms
were
benumbed
from
having
been
confined
so
many
days
and
that
i
could
not
use
them
showed
the
most
lively
commiseration
for
my
sufferings
she
gently
chafed
my
wrists
with
her
hands
and
showed
every
sign
of
pity
in
her
countenance
as
indeed
did
all
the
other
three
but
i
was
by
far
the
youngest
of
the
whole
party
who
had
been
captured
and
seemed
most
to
excite
their
pity
and
shortly
afterwards
we
were
all
taken
into
an
adjoining
tent
or
hut
and
our
bodies
were
rubbed
all
over
with
an
oil
which
after
a
few
days
application
left
us
perfectly
healed
and
as
smooth
as
silk
so
altered
was
our
condition
that
those
very
people
who
had
guarded
us
with
their
spears
and
threatened
us
with
death
were
now
ordered
to
wait
upon
us
and
as
the
king
wives
frequently
came
to
see
how
we
were
treated
we
were
served
with
the
utmost
humility
and
attention
chapter
six
i
am
given
as
a
slave
to
the
old
king
favourite
whyna
assist
my
young
mistress
to
make
her
toilet
hold
frequent
conversations
with
her
and
become
strongly
attached
to
her
my
hatred
and
dread
of
the
old
king
increase
he
shoots
a
man
with
one
morning
after
we
had
been
about
three
weeks
in
these
comfortable
quarters
i
was
summoned
away
from
my
companions
into
the
presence
of
the
king
when
i
came
before
him
a
small
manacle
was
fixed
round
my
left
ankle
and
another
round
my
left
wrist
with
a
light
chain
connecting
the
two
a
circle
of
feathers
was
put
round
my
head
and
a
loose
cloth
wrapped
round
my
loins
i
was
then
led
forward
to
him
with
my
arms
crossed
over
my
breast
and
my
head
bowed
by
his
orders
i
was
then
placed
behind
the
youngest
of
the
four
women
the
one
who
had
chafed
my
wrists
and
i
was
given
to
understand
that
i
was
her
slave
and
was
to
attend
upon
her
to
which
i
must
say
i
gave
a
joyful
assent
in
my
heart
although
i
did
not
at
that
time
show
any
signs
of
gladness
there
i
remained
with
my
arms
folded
and
bowed
as
before
until
dinner
was
brought
in
and
a
calabash
full
of
was
put
into
my
hands
to
place
before
the
king
and
his
wives
my
first
attempt
at
service
was
not
very
adroit
for
in
my
eagerness
to
do
my
duty
i
tripped
over
the
corner
of
the
mat
which
served
them
for
a
table
and
tumbling
headlong
forward
emptied
the
calabash
of
which
i
held
in
my
hand
upon
the
legs
of
the
old
king
who
sat
opposite
to
where
i
was
advancing
he
jumped
up
roaring
out
with
anger
while
i
in
my
fear
sprung
on
my
legs
and
rushed
to
the
side
of
the
apartment
expecting
immediate
death
fortunately
the
victuals
in
this
country
are
always
served
up
cool
and
my
new
mistress
easily
obtained
my
pardon
laughing
heartily
at
the
scene
and
at
my
apprehension
the
repast
being
over
i
was
ordered
to
follow
my
mistress
who
retired
to
another
hut
according
to
their
custom
to
sleep
during
the
heat
of
the
day
i
was
placed
before
the
door
to
prevent
her
being
disturbed
my
only
duty
now
was
to
attend
upon
my
young
mistress
she
was
the
king
favourite
wife
and
as
she
was
uniformly
kind
and
gentle
i
should
have
almost
ceased
to
lament
my
loss
of
liberty
had
it
not
been
from
the
fear
i
had
of
the
old
monarch
i
knew
that
my
preservation
depended
entirely
upon
my
mistress
favour
and
i
endeavoured
all
i
could
to
conciliate
her
by
the
most
sedulous
attentions
to
please
young
and
generous
in
disposition
she
was
easily
satisfied
by
my
ready
obedience
and
careful
service
i
do
not
think
that
she
was
more
than
seventeen
years
of
age
but
they
are
women
at
fourteen
in
that
country
and
even
earlier
she
was
a
negress
as
to
colour
but
not
a
real
negress
for
her
hair
although
short
and
very
wavy
was
not
woolly
and
her
nose
was
straight
her
mouth
was
small
and
her
teeth
beautiful
her
figure
was
perfect
her
limbs
being
very
elegantly
formed
when
she
first
rose
in
the
morning
i
attended
her
to
the
brow
of
a
hill
just
without
the
palisades
where
with
devout
but
mistaken
piety
she
adored
the
rising
sun
at
least
it
appeared
to
me
that
she
did
so
she
then
went
down
to
the
river
to
bathe
and
as
soon
as
her
hair
was
dry
she
had
it
dressed
this
office
after
a
short
time
devolved
upon
me
and
i
became
very
expert
having
to
rub
her
hair
with
a
sweet
oil
and
then
roll
it
up
in
its
natural
curls
with
a
quill
so
as
to
dispose
them
to
the
most
fanciful
advantage
as
to
form
after
her
toilet
was
complete
she
went
to
feed
her
poultry
and
some
antelopes
and
other
beasts
and
then
she
practised
at
a
mark
with
her
bow
and
arrows
and
javelin
till
about
ten
when
she
went
to
the
king
hut
and
they
all
sat
down
to
eat
together
after
the
repast
which
lasted
some
time
if
she
did
not
repose
with
the
king
she
retired
to
her
own
hut
where
she
usually
refreshed
herself
till
about
four
when
she
returned
to
the
king
or
ranged
the
woods
or
otherwise
amused
herself
during
the
rest
of
the
evening
i
will
say
for
the
old
savage
that
he
did
not
confine
his
wives
such
was
our
general
course
of
life
and
wherever
she
went
i
attended
her
the
attachment
i
showed
and
really
felt
for
her
secured
her
confidence
and
she
always
treated
me
in
a
kind
and
familiar
manner
their
language
consists
of
few
words
compared
to
our
own
and
in
a
short
time
by
help
of
signs
we
understood
each
other
tolerably
well
she
appeared
to
have
a
most
ardent
curiosity
to
know
who
we
were
and
from
whence
we
came
and
all
the
time
that
we
passed
alone
was
employed
in
putting
questions
and
my
endeavouring
to
find
out
her
meaning
and
answer
them
this
although
very
difficult
at
first
i
was
eventually
enabled
to
accomplish
indifferently
well
she
was
most
zealous
in
her
mistaken
religion
and
one
morning
when
i
was
following
her
to
her
devotions
on
the
hill
she
asked
me
where
my
god
was
i
pointed
upwards
upon
which
she
told
me
with
great
joy
and
innocency
that
hers
was
there
too
and
that
therefore
they
must
be
the
same
god
or
if
not
they
must
be
friends
convinced
that
she
was
right
she
made
me
worship
with
her
bowing
my
head
down
to
the
sand
and
going
through
the
same
forms
which
of
course
i
did
not
understand
the
meaning
of
but
i
prayed
to
my
god
and
therefore
made
no
objection
as
it
was
pleasing
to
her
this
apparent
conformity
in
religion
recommended
me
more
strongly
to
her
and
we
became
more
intimate
and
i
was
certainly
attached
to
her
by
every
tie
of
gratitude
i
was
quite
happy
in
the
friendship
and
kindness
she
showed
towards
me
the
only
drawback
was
my
fear
of
the
proud
old
king
and
the
recollection
of
him
often
made
me
cheek
myself
and
suddenly
assume
a
more
distant
and
respectful
demeanour
towards
her
i
soon
found
out
that
she
dreaded
the
old
savage
as
much
as
i
did
and
hated
him
even
more
in
his
presence
she
treated
me
very
sternly
and
ordered
me
about
in
a
very
dictatorial
manner
but
when
we
were
alone
and
had
no
fear
of
being
seen
she
would
then
be
very
familiar
sometimes
even
locking
her
arm
into
mine
and
laughing
as
she
pointed
out
the
contrast
of
the
colours
and
in
the
full
gaiety
of
her
young
heart
rejoicing
that
we
were
alone
and
could
converse
freely
together
as
she
was
very
intelligent
she
soon
perceived
that
i
possessed
much
knowledge
that
she
did
not
and
that
she
could
not
comprehend
what
i
wanted
to
teach
her
this
induced
her
to
look
upon
me
with
respect
as
well
as
kindness
one
day
i
purposely
left
her
bow
behind
in
the
hut
where
my
companions
resided
and
on
her
asking
me
for
it
i
told
her
that
i
had
done
so
but
that
i
would
make
my
companions
send
it
without
my
going
back
i
tore
off
a
piece
of
the
bark
of
a
tree
and
with
the
point
of
an
arrow
i
wrote
to
one
of
them
desiring
him
to
send
it
by
bearer
and
calling
a
young
negro
boy
told
him
in
her
presence
to
give
that
piece
of
bark
to
the
white
man
and
come
back
again
to
the
queen
whyna
for
such
was
the
name
of
my
mistress
queen
stood
in
suspense
waiting
the
result
in
a
few
minutes
the
boy
returned
bringing
the
bow
astonished
at
this
she
made
me
write
again
and
again
for
her
arrows
her
lance
and
many
other
things
finding
by
these
being
immediately
sent
that
we
had
a
method
of
communicating
with
each
other
at
a
distance
she
earnestly
insisted
upon
being
taught
so
surprising
an
art
going
at
a
distance
from
me
she
ordered
me
to
talk
to
her
when
out
of
hearing
and
finding
that
i
could
not
or
as
she
seemed
to
suppose
that
i
would
not
she
became
discontented
and
out
of
humour
i
could
by
no
means
make
her
comprehend
how
it
was
performed
but
i
made
her
understand
that
as
soon
as
i
was
fully
acquainted
with
her
language
i
should
be
able
to
teach
her
she
was
satisfied
with
this
but
made
me
promise
that
i
would
teach
nobody
else
by
the
canoes
in
the
river
i
easily
made
her
comprehend
that
i
came
in
a
vast
boat
from
a
distant
land
over
a
great
expanse
of
water
and
also
how
it
was
that
we
fell
into
the
negroes
power
i
then
found
out
from
her
that
the
negroes
had
pretended
that
we
had
invaded
their
land
to
procure
slaves
and
that
they
had
vanquished
us
in
battle
hence
their
songs
of
triumph
on
bringing
us
to
the
king
i
pointed
out
the
heavenly
bodies
to
her
in
the
evenings
trying
to
make
her
comprehend
something
of
their
nature
and
motions
but
in
vain
this
had
however
one
good
effect
she
looked
up
to
me
with
more
respect
hoping
that
some
day
when
i
could
fully
explain
myself
she
might
be
herself
taught
all
these
wonders
with
these
feelings
towards
me
added
to
my
sedulous
endeavours
to
please
her
and
obey
her
slightest
wishes
it
is
not
surprising
that
she
treated
me
as
a
companion
and
not
as
a
slave
and
gave
me
every
innocent
proof
of
her
attachment
more
i
never
wished
and
almost
dreaded
that
our
intimacy
would
be
too
great
happy
when
alone
with
her
i
ever
returned
with
reluctance
to
the
presence
of
the
old
king
whose
sight
and
company
i
dreaded
the
boundless
cruelty
of
this
monster
was
a
continual
check
to
all
my
happiness
accustomed
to
blood
from
his
childhood
he
appeared
wholly
insensible
to
human
feelings
and
derided
the
agonies
of
the
wretches
who
daily
fell
by
his
hands
one
day
he
amused
himself
by
shooting
small
at
a
man
who
was
bound
to
a
post
before
the
tent
which
was
placed
there
for
the
punishment
of
those
who
were
his
victims
he
continued
for
hours
fixing
the
arrows
in
different
parts
of
his
body
mimicking
and
deriding
his
cries
at
last
contrary
to
his
intentions
one
of
the
arrows
hit
the
man
in
the
throat
and
his
head
drooped
as
the
old
savage
saw
that
the
poor
man
was
dying
he
drew
another
arrow
and
sent
it
through
his
heart
very
much
annoyed
at
his
disappointment
in
not
prolonging
the
poor
creature
sufferings
i
was
witness
to
this
scene
with
silent
horror
and
many
more
of
a
similar
nature
i
hardly
need
say
that
i
felt
what
my
punishment
would
be
if
i
had
by
any
means
roused
the
jealousy
of
this
monster
and
i
knew
that
without
giving
him
real
cause
a
moment
of
bare
suspicion
would
be
sufficient
to
sacrifice
my
mistress
as
well
as
me
chapter
seven

a
hunting

of
wild
animals

i
in
great
danger
from
a

barbarity
of
the

to
my

companions
are
ransomed
sad
parting
with
whyna
after
an
encounter
with
a
hostile
people
we
reach
senegal
return
to
england
i
had
been
about
three
months
in
captivity
when
the
old
king
with
his
four
wives
and
a
large
party
of
negroes
left
the
town
and
went
into
the
woods
to
hunt
my
companions
were
left
in
the
town
but
i
was
ordered
to
attend
my
mistress
and
i
went
with
the
hopes
of
being
able
by
some
means
to
make
my
escape
for
my
fear
of
the
old
monarch
was
much
greater
than
my
regard
for
my
mistress
as
i
had
not
become
a
proficient
with
the
bows
and
arrows
or
in
hurling
the
javelin
i
was
equipped
with
a
strong
spear
my
mistress
was
skilful
to
admiration
with
the
arrow
and
javelin
she
never
missed
her
aim
that
i
knew
and
she
certainly
never
appeared
to
such
advantage
as
she
did
at
this
her
activity
her
symmetry
of
limb
and
her
courage
her
skill
with
her
weapons
all
won
the
heart
of
the
old
king
and
i
believe
that
his
strong
attachment
to
her
arose
more
from
her
possession
of
the
above
qualities
than
from
any
other
cause
certain
it
is
that
the
old
savage
doted
on
her
she
was
the
only
being
who
could
bend
his
stubborn
will
as
his
age
prevented
him
from
joining
in
the
chase
he
always
appeared
to
part
with
her
with
regret
and
to
caution
her
not
to
run
into
useless
danger
and
when
we
returned
at
night
the
old
man
eyes
sparkled
with
the
rapture
of
dotage
as
he
welcomed
her
return
the
method
of
our
chase
was
to
beat
the
country
with
a
number
of
men
in
a
vast
circle
until
we
had
gathered
all
the
game
into
one
thicket
then
the
strongest
warriors
with
their
large
spears
went
in
and
drove
out
the
game
which
was
killed
by
the
hunters
who
hovered
about
within
the
circle
the
animals
which
we
had
to
encounter
were
large
fierce
black
pigs
leopards
jackals
tigers
mountain
cats
and
others
which
i
have
no
name
for
and
in
spite
of
the
ferocity
of
many
of
these
animals
when
they
bounded
out
they
were
met
with
such
a
shower
of
javelins
or
transfixed
by
the
strong
of
the
warriors
that
few
escaped
and
they
rarely
did
any
mischief
one
day
however
the
beaters
having
just
entered
a
thicket
whyna
who
was
eager
for
the
sport
and
plied
within
the
circle
with
the
other
hunters
hearing
a
rustling
in
the
jungle
went
to
the
verge
of
it
to
be
the
first
to
strike
the
animal
which
came
out
as
usual
i
was
close
to
her
when
a
large
tiger
burst
out
and
she
pierced
him
with
her
javelin
but
not
sufficient
to
wound
the
animal
so
severely
as
to
disable
him
the
tiger
turned
and
i
drove
my
spear
into
his
throat
this
checked
him
as
it
remained
in
but
in
a
spring
which
he
gave
the
handle
broke
short
off
and
although
the
iron
went
further
in
our
danger
was
imminent
whyna
ran
and
so
did
i
to
escape
from
the
beast
fury
for
although
after
i
had
wounded
it
with
my
spear
we
had
both
retreated
we
were
not
so
far
but
that
in
two
or
three
bounds
he
would
have
been
upon
us
my
mistress
was
as
fleet
as
the
wind
and
soon
passed
me
but
as
she
passed
me
she
caught
me
by
the
hand
and
dragged
me
along
at
a
pace
that
with
difficulty
i
could
keep
my
legs
the
surrounding
hunters
alarmed
at
her
danger
and
knowing
what
they
had
to
expect
from
the
mercy
of
the
old
king
if
she
was
destroyed
by
the
animal
closed
in
between
us
and
the
tiger
and
after
a
fierce
combat
in
which
some
were
killed
and
many
wounded
they
despatched
him
with
their
spears
the
head
of
the
animal
which
was
of
unusual
size
was
cut
off
and
carried
home
to
the
old
king
in
triumph
and
when
he
heard
of
the
danger
that
whyna
had
been
in
he
caressed
her
with
tears
and
i
could
not
help
saying
that
the
old
wretch
had
some
heart
after
all
whyna
told
the
king
that
if
i
had
not
pierced
the
animal
with
my
spear
and
prevented
his
taking
his
first
spring
she
should
have
lost
her
life
and
the
monster
grinned
a
ghastly
smile
at
me
which
i
presume
he
meant
for
either
approbation
or
gratitude
at
other
times
the
chase
would
be
that
of
the
multitude
of
birds
which
were
to
be
found
in
the
woods
the
bow
and
arrow
only
were
used
and
all
i
had
to
do
now
was
to
pick
up
all
my
mistress
had
killed
and
return
her
arrows
she
would
constantly
kill
on
the
wing
with
her
arrow
which
not
many
could
do
besides
her
by
degrees
i
imbibed
a
strong
passion
for
the
sport
attended
as
it
was
with
considerable
danger
and
was
never
so
happy
as
when
engaged
in
it
we
remained
about
two
months
in
the
woods
when
the
king
was
tired
and
we
returned
to
the
town
where
i
continued
for
some
time
to
pass
the
same
kind
of
life
as
i
had
done
before
i
should
have
been
quite
happy
in
my
slavery
from
my
affection
to
my
mistress
had
not
a
fresh
instance
of
the
unbounded
cruelty
of
the
old
monarch
occurred
a
few
days
after
our
return
from
the
chase
which
filled
us
all
with
consternation
and
horror
for
we
discovered
that
not
even
my
mistress
whyna
could
always
prevail
with
the
savage
monster
one
morning
i
perceived
that
one
of
the
king
guards
who
had
always
treated
me
with
great
kindness
and
with
whom
i
was
very
intimate
was
tied
up
to
the
executioner
post
before
the
hut
aware
of
the
fate
which
awaited
him
i
ran
to
the
hut
of
whyna
and
so
great
was
my
distress
that
i
could
not
speak
all
i
could
do
was
to
clasp
her
knees
and
repeat
the
man
name
pointing
to
the
post
to
which
he
was
tied
she
understood
me
and
eager
to
save
the
man
or
to
oblige
me
she
ran
to
the
large
hut
and
attempted
to
intercede
with
the
old
barbarian
for
the
man
life
but
he
was
in
an
agony
of
rage
and
passion
he
refused
her
lifting
up
his
sabre
to
despatch
the
man
whyna
was
rash
enough
to
seize
the
king
arm
and
prevent
the
blow
at
this
his
rage
redoubled
his
eyes
glowed
like
live
coals
and
turning
to
her
with
the
look
of
a
demon
he
caught
her
by
the
hair
and
dragging
her
across
his
feet
lifted
up
his
scimitar
in
the
act
to
strike
off
her
head
i
sickened
with
horror
at
the
danger
she
was
in
but
i
thought
he
would
not
strike
i
had
no
weapon
but
if
he
had
done
so
i
would
have
revenged
her
death
even
if
i
had
lost
my
life
at
last
the
old
monster
let
go
her
hair
spurning
her
away
with
his
foot
so
that
she
rolled
over
on
the
sand
and
then
turning
to
the
unhappy
man
with
an
upward
slanting
blow
of
his
sabre
he
ripped
him
up
from
the
flank
to
the
chest
so
that
his
bowels
fell
down
at
his
feet
he
then
looked
round
at
us
all
with
an
aspect
which
froze
our
blood
and
turned
away
sulkily
to
his
hut
leaving
us
to
recover
our
spirits
how
we
might
poor
whyna
terrified
and
enraged
at
the
same
time
as
soon
as
i
had
led
her
to
her
hut
and
we
were
by
ourselves
gave
way
to
the
storm
of
passion
which
swelled
her
bosom
execrating
her
husband
with
the
utmost
loathing
and
abhorrence
and
lamenting
in
the
most
passionate
manner
her
having
ever
been
connected
with
him
trembling
alike
at
the
danger
to
which
i
had
exposed
her
and
moved
by
her
condition
i
could
not
help
mingling
my
tears
with
hers
and
endeavoured
by
caresses
and
condoling
with
her
to
reduce
her
excitement
had
the
old
king
seen
me
i
know
what
both
our
fates
would
have
been
but
at
that
time
i
cared
not
i
was
very
young
very
impetuous
and
i
was
resolved
that
i
would
not
permit
either
her
or
myself
to
die
unavenged
at
last
she
sobbed
herself
to
sleep
and
i
took
my
usual
station
outside
of
the
hut
it
was
well
that
i
did
so
for
not
five
minutes
afterwards
the
old
wretch
having
got
over
his
temper
came
out
of
his
tent
and
bent
his
steps
towards
the
hut
that
he
might
make
friends
with
her
for
she
was
too
necessary
to
his
happiness
he
soon
treated
her
with
his
accustomed
kindness
but
i
perceived
that
after
the
scene
i
have
described
her
aversion
for
him
was
doubled
there
were
some
scores
of
women
in
the
various
huts
within
the
palisade
all
of
whom
i
understood
were
wives
to
the
old
monarch
but
none
but
the
four
we
found
with
him
when
we
were
first
brought
into
his
presence
were
ever
to
be
seen
in
his
company
i
had
by
means
of
my
kind
mistress
the
opportunity
of
constantly
supplying
my
companions
with
fowls
and
venison
which
was
left
from
the
king
table
and
through
her
care
they
always
met
with
kind
and
gentle
usage
for
another
two
months
did
i
thus
remain
happy
in
the
company
of
whyna
and
miserable
when
in
the
presence
of
the
king
whose
eye
it
was
impossible
to
meet
without
quailing
when
one
morning
we
were
all
ordered
out
and
were
surrounded
by
a
large
party
armed
with
spears
javelins
and
i
say
as
those
that
they
use
in
war
are
much
larger
we
soon
discovered
that
we
were
to
be
sent
to
some
other
place
but
where
or
why
we
could
not
find
out
shortly
afterwards
the
crowd
opened
and
whyna
made
her
appearance
she
took
the
feather
circle
off
my
head
and
the
manacles
off
my
wrist
and
leg
and
went
and
laid
them
at
the
king
feet
she
then
returned
and
told
me
that
i
was
free
as
well
as
my
companions
but
that
i
only
if
i
chose
had
permission
to
remain
with
her
i
did
not
at
first
reply
she
then
in
the
most
earnest
manner
begged
me
to
remain
with
her
as
her
slave
and
as
she
did
not
dare
to
say
what
she
felt
or
use
caresses
to
prevail
upon
me
she
stamped
her
little
feet
with
eagerness
and
impatience
the
struggle
in
my
own
heart
was
excessive
i
presumed
that
we
were
about
to
be
made
a
present
to
some
other
king
and
i
felt
that
i
never
could
expect
so
easy
and
so
pleasant
a
servitude
as
i
then
enjoyed
i
was
sincerely
attached
and
indeed
latterly
i
was
more
than
attached
to
whyna
i
felt
that
it
was
dangerous
had
the
old
king
been
dead
i
would
have
been
content
to
pass
my
life
with
her
and
i
was
still
hesitating
notwithstanding
the
remonstrances
of
my
companions
when
the
crowd
opened
a
little
and
i
beheld
the
old
king
looking
at
me
and
i
felt
convinced
that
his
jealousy
was
at
last
aroused
and
that
if
i
consented
to
remain
my
life
would
not
be
worth
a
day
purchase
whyna
also
turned
and
met
the
look
of
the
old
king
whether
she
read
in
his
countenance
what
i
did
i
know
not
but
this
is
certain
she
made
no
more
attempts
to
persuade
me
but
waving
her
hand
for
us
to
set
off
on
our
journey
she
slowly
retired
and
when
arrived
at
the
hut
turned
round
towards
us
we
all
prostrated
ourselves
before
her
and
then
set
off
on
our
journey
she
retired
to
the
door
of
her
own
hut
and
two
or
three
times
waved
her
hand
to
us
at
which
our
guards
made
us
every
time
again
prostrate
ourselves
she
then
walked
out
to
the
little
hill
where
she
always
went
up
to
pray
and
for
the
last
time
waved
her
hand
and
then
i
perceived
her
sink
down
on
the
ground
and
turn
her
head
in
the
direction
which
she
always
did
when
she
prayed
we
now
proceeded
on
our
journey
in
a
direction
our
guards
treating
us
with
the
greatest
kindness
we
rested
every
day
from
ten
till
four
in
the
afternoon
and
then
walked
till
late
at
night
corn
was
supplied
us
from
the
scattered
hamlets
as
we
passed
along
and
our
escort
procured
us
flesh
and
fowl
with
their
bows
and
arrows
but
we
were
in
a
state
of
great
anxiety
to
know
where
we
were
going
and
nobody
appeared
able
or
willing
to
tell
us
i
often
thought
of
whyna
and
at
times
repented
that
i
had
not
remained
with
her
as
i
feared
falling
into
a
worse
slavery
but
the
recollection
of
the
old
king
diabolical
parting
look
was
sufficient
to
make
me
think
that
it
was
best
as
it
was
now
that
i
had
left
my
mistress
i
thought
of
her
kindness
and
amiable
qualities
and
her
affection
for
me
and
although
it
may
appear
strange
that
i
should
feel
myself
in
love
with
a
black
woman
i
will
not
deny
but
that
i
was
so
i
could
not
help
being
so
and
that
is
all
the
excuse
i
can
offer
our
guards
now
informed
us
that
we
were
about
to
pass
for
a
few
miles
through
the
territory
of
another
king
and
that
they
were
not
sure
what
our
reception
might
be
but
this
was
soon
made
evident
for
we
observed
a
party
behind
us
which
moved
as
we
moved
although
they
did
not
attack
us
and
soon
afterwards
a
larger
body
in
front
were
blocking
up
our
passage
and
we
found
that
we
were
beset
the
commander
of
our
party
therefore
gave
orders
for
battle
and
he
put
into
our
hands
strong
spears
they
being
the
only
weapons
we
could
use
and
entreated
us
to
fight
our
party
was
greatly
by
the
enemy
but
ours
were
chosen
warriors
as
for
us
white
men
we
kept
together
agreeing
among
ourselves
that
we
would
defend
ourselves
if
attacked
but
would
not
offend
either
party
by
taking
an
unnecessary
part
in
the
fray
as
it
was
immaterial
to
us
to
whom
we
belonged
the
battle
or
rather
skirmish
soon
began
they
dispersed
and
shot
their
arrows
from
behind
the
trees
and
this
warfare
continued
some
time
without
damage
to
either
party
till
at
last
they
attacked
us
closely
then
our
commander
killing
that
of
the
enemy
they
gave
way
just
as
another
party
was
coming
forward
to
attack
us
white
men
but
finding
us
resolute
in
our
defence
and
our
own
warriors
coming
to
our
assistance
the
rout
was
general
they
could
not
however
prevent
some
prisoners
from
being
taken
most
of
them
wounded
with
the
which
having
their
barbs
twisted
in
the
form
of
an
s
gave
great
pain
in
their
extraction
i
observed
that
a
particular
herb
chewed
and
bound
up
with
the
bleeding
wound
was
their
only
remedy
and
that
when
the
bone
was
injured
they
considered
the
wound
mortal
we
now
turned
to
the
eastward
to
get
back
into
our
own
territory
we
left
the
prisoners
and
wounded
at
a
village
and
receiving
a
reinforcement
we
took
a
circuit
to
avoid
this
hostile
people
and
continued
our
route
on
the
eighth
morning
just
as
we
were
stopping
to
repose
one
of
the
warriors
who
had
mounted
a
hill
before
us
shouted
and
waved
his
hand
we
ran
up
to
him
and
as
soon
as
we
gained
the
summit
were
transported
with
the
sight
of
the
british
flag
flying
on
senegal
fort
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
we
now
understood
that
by
some
means
or
another
we
had
been
ransomed
and
so
it
proved
to
be
for
the
governor
hearing
that
we
were
prisoners
up
the
country
had
sent
messengers
offering
the
old
king
a
handsome
present
for
our
liberation
i
afterwards
found
out
that
the
price
paid
in
goods
amounted
to
about
shillings
a
head
the
governor
received
us
kindly
clothed
us
and
sent
us
down
to
the
ship
which
was
with
a
full
cargo
in
the
road
and
intending
to
sail
the
next
day
and
we
were
received
and
welcomed
by
our
messmates
as
men
risen
from
the
dead
we
sailed
two
days
afterwards
and
had
a
fortunate
voyage
home

liverpool

to

as
the
captain
reported
me
to
be
a
very
attentive
and
good
officer
although
i
was
then
but
years
of
age
and
as
i
had
been
previously
on
good
terms
and
useful
to
the
owner
i
was
kindly
received
by
him
and
paid
much
more
attention
to
than
my
situation
on
board
might
warrant
my
captivity
among
the
negroes
and
the
narrative
i
gave
of
my
adventures
were
also
a
source
of
much
interest
i
was
at
first
questioned
by
the
gentlemen
of
liverpool
and
afterwards
one
of
the
merchant
ladies
who
had
heard
something
of
my
adventures
and
found
out
that
i
was
a
young
and
personable
man
with
better
manners
than
are
usually
to
be
found
before
the
mast
invited
me
one
evening
to
a
that
i
might
amuse
her
friends
with
my
adventures
they
were
most
curious
about
the
negro
queen
whyna
inquiring
into
every
particular
as
to
her
personal
appearance
and
dress
and
trying
to
find
out
as
women
always
do
if
there
was
anything
of
an
intrigue
between
us
they
shook
their
little
fingers
at
me
when
i
solemnly
declared
that
there
was
not
and
one
or
two
of
them
cajoled
me
aside
to
obtain
my
acknowledgment
of
what
they
really
believed
to
be
the
truth
although
i
would
not
confess
it
when
they
had
tired
themselves
with
asking
questions
about
the
negro
queen
they
then
began
to
ask
about
myself
and
how
it
happened
i
was
not
such
a
bear
and
coarse
in
my
manners
and
address
as
the
other
seamen
to
this
i
could
give
no
other
reply
but
that
i
had
been
educated
when
a
child
they
would
fain
know
who
were
my
father
and
mother
and
in
what
station
of
life
it
had
pleased
god
to
place
them
but
i
hardly
need
say
my
dear
madam
to
you
who
are
so
well
acquainted
with
my
birth
and
parentage
that
i
would
not
disgrace
my
family
by
acknowledging
that
one
of
their
sons
was
in
a
situation
so
unworthy
not
that
i
thought
at
that
time
nor
do
i
think
now
that
i
was
so
much
to
blame
in
preferring
independence
in
a
humble
position
to
the
life
that
induced
me
to
take
the
step
which
i
did
but
as
i
could
not
state
who
my
family
were
without
also
stating
why
i
had
quitted
them
i
preserved
silence
as
i
did
not
think
that
i
had
any
right
to
communicate
family
secrets
to
strangers
the
consequences
of
my
first
introduction
to
genteel
society
were
very
agreeable
i
received
many
more
invitations
from
the
company
assembled
notwithstanding
that
my
sailor
attire
but
ill
corresponded
with
the
powdered
wigs
and
silk
waistcoats
of
the
gentlemen
or
the
hoops
and
furbelows
of
satin
which
set
off
the
charms
of
the
ladies
at
first
i
did
not
care
so
much
but
as
i
grew
more
at
my
ease
i
felt
ashamed
of
my
dress
and
the
more
so
as
the
young
foplings
would
put
their
glasses
to
their
eyes
and
look
at
me
as
if
i
were
a
monster
but
supported
as
i
was
by
the
fair
sex
i
cared
little
for
them
the
ladies
vowed
that
i
was
charming
and
paid
me
much
courtesy
indeed
my
vanity
more
than
once
made
me
suspect
that
i
was
something
more
than
a
mere
favourite
with
one
or
two
of
them
one
especially
a
buxom
young
person
and
very
coquettish
who
told
me
as
we
were
looking
out
of
the
of
the
that
since
i
could
be
so
secret
with
respect
to
what
took
place
between
the
negress
queen
and
myself
i
must
be
sure
to
command
the
and
favour
of
the
ladies
who
always
admired
discretion
in
so
young
and
so
handsome
a
man
but
i
was
not
to
be
seduced
by
this
flattery
for
somehow
or
another
i
had
ever
before
me
the
french
lady
and
her
conduct
to
me
and
i
had
almost
a
dislike
or
i
should
rather
say
i
had
imbibed
an
indifference
for
the
sex
this
admission
into
good
society
did
however
have
one
effect
upon
me
it
made
me
more
particular
in
my
dress
and
all
my
wages
were
employed
in
the
decoration
of
my
person
at
that
time
you
may
recollect
madam
there
were
but
two
styles
of
dress
among
the
seamen
one
was
that
worn
by
those
who
sailed
in
the
northern
seas
and
the
other
by
those
who
navigated
in
the
tropical
countries
both
suitable
to
the
climates
the
first
was
the
jacket
woollen
frock
breeches
and
petticoat
of
canvass
over
all
with
worsted
stockings
shoes
and
buckles
and
usually
a
cap
of
skin
upon
the
head
the
other
a
light
short
jacket
with
hanging
buttons
red
sash
trowsers
and
neat
shoes
and
buckles
with
a
small
embroidered
cap
with
falling
crown
or
a
hat
and
feather
it
was
this
last
which
i
had
always
worn
having
been
continually
in
warm
climates
and
my
hair
was
dressed
in
its
natural
ringlets
instead
of
a
wig
which
i
was
never
partial
to
although
very
common
among
seamen
my
ears
were
pierced
and
i
wore
long
gold
earrings
as
well
as
gilt
buckles
in
my
shoes
and
by
degrees
i
not
only
improved
my
dress
so
as
to
make
it
very
handsome
in
materials
but
my
manners
were
also
very
much
altered
for
the
better
i
had
been
at
liverpool
about
two
months
waiting
for
the
ship
to
unload
and
take
in
cargo
for
another
voyage
when
a
privateer
belonging
to
the
same
owner
came
into
port
with
four
prizes
of
considerable
value
and
the
day
afterwards
i
was
invited
by
the
owner
to
meet
the
captain
who
commanded
the
privateer
he
was
a
very
different
looking
person
from
captain
weatherall
who
was
a
stout
man
with
a
countenance
he
on
the
contrary
was
a
young
man
of
about
very
slight
in
person
with
a
dark
complexion
hair
and
eyes
jet
black
i
should
have
called
him
a
very
handsome
jew
for
he
bore
that
cast
of
countenance
and
i
afterwards
discovered
that
he
was
of
that
origin
although
i
can
not
say
that
he
ever
followed
the
observances
of
that
remarkable
people
he
was
handsomely
dressed
wearing
his
hair
slightly
powdered
a
laced
coat
and
waistcoat
blue
sash
and
trowsers
with
pistols
and
dagger
in
his
belt
and
a
smart
hanger
by
his
side
he
had
several
diamond
rings
on
his
finger
and
carried
a
small
clouded
cane
altogether
i
had
never
fallen
in
with
so
smart
and
prepossessing
a
personage
and
should
have
taken
him
for
one
of
the
gentlemen
commanding
the
king
ships
rather
than
the
captain
of
a
liverpool
privateer
he
talked
well
and
fluently
and
with
an
air
of
command
and
decision
taking
the
lead
in
the
company
although
it
might
have
been
considered
that
he
was
not
by
any
means
the
principal
person
in
it
the
owner
during
the
evening
informed
me
that
he
was
a
officer
of
great
personal
courage
and
that
he
had
made
a
great
deal
of
money
which
he
had
squandered
away
almost
as
fast
as
he
received
it
with
this
person
whose
name
was
captain
levee
an
alteration
i
suspect
from
levi
i
was
much
pleased
and
as
i
found
that
he
did
not
appear
to
despise
my
acquaintance
i
took
much
pains
to
please
him
and
we
were
becoming
very
intimate
when
my
ship
was
ready
to
sail
i
now
found
that
i
was
promoted
to
the
office
of
first
mate
which
gave
me
great
satisfaction
we
sailed
with
an
assorted
cargo
but
very
light
and
nothing
of
consequence
occurred
during
our
passage
out
we
made
good
traffic
on
the
coast
as
we
ran
down
it
receiving
ivory
and
wax
in
exchange
for
our
printed
cottons
and
hardware
after
being
six
weeks
on
the
coast
we
put
into
senegal
to
dispose
of
the
remainder
of
our
cargo
which
we
soon
did
to
the
governor
who
gave
us
a
fair
exchange
although
by
no
means
so
profitable
a
barter
as
what
we
had
made
on
the
coast
but
that
we
did
not
expect
for
what
might
be
called
the
refuse
of
our
cargo
the
captain
was
much
pleased
as
he
knew
the
owner
would
be
satisfied
with
him
and
moreover
he
had
himself
a
venture
in
the
cargo
and
we
had
just
received
the
remainder
of
the
ivory
from
the
governor
stores
and
had
only
to
get
on
board
a
sufficiency
of
provisions
and
water
for
our
homeward
voyage
when
a
circumstance
took
place
which
i
must
now
relate
our
crew
consisted
of
the
captain
and
myself
as
first
mate
the
second
mate
and
twelve
seamen
four
of
which
were
those
who
had
been
taken
prisoners
with
me
and
had
been
released
as
i
have
related
in
our
previous
voyage
these
four
men
were
very
much
attached
to
me
i
believe
chiefly
from
my
kindness
to
them
when
i
was
a
slave
to
the
queen
whyna
as
i
always
procured
for
them
everything
which
i
could
and
through
the
exertions
of
my
mistress
had
them
plentifully
supplied
with
provisions
from
the
king
table
the
second
mate
and
other
eight
men
we
had
shipped
at
liverpool
they
were
fine
stout
fellows
but
appeared
to
be
loose
characters
but
that
we
did
not
discover
till
after
we
had
sailed
there
was
anchored
with
us
at
senegal
a
low
black
brig
employed
in
the
which
had
made
the
bay
at
the
same
time
that
we
did
and
to
their
great
surprise
for
she
was
considered
a
very
fast
sailer
she
was
beaten
at
all
points
by
our
ship
which
was
considered
the
fastest
vessel
out
of
liverpool
the
crew
of
the
slaver
were
numerous
and
as
bloodthirsty
a
set
of
looking
fellows
as
ever
i
fell
in
with
their
boat
was
continually
alongside
of
our
vessel
and
i
perceived
that
their
visits
were
made
to
the
eight
men
whom
we
had
shipped
at
liverpool
and
that
they
did
not
appear
inclined
to
be
at
all
intimate
with
the
rest
of
the
crew
this
roused
my
suspicions
although
i
said
nothing
but
i
watched
them
very
closely
one
forenoon
as
i
was
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
concealed
by
the
from
the
sight
of
those
on
deck
i
heard
our
men
talking
over
the
side
and
at
last
as
i
remained
concealed
that
i
might
overhear
the
conversation
one
of
the
slaver
men
from
the
boat
said
at
eight
we
will
come
to
arrange
the
whole
business
the
boat
then
shoved
off
and
pulled
for
the
brig
now
it
was
the
custom
of
the
captain
to
go
on
shore
every
evening
to
drink
sangaree
and
smoke
with
the
governor
and
very
often
i
went
with
him
leaving
the
ship
in
charge
of
the
second
mate
it
had
been
my
intention
and
i
had
stated
as
much
to
the
second
mate
to
go
this
evening
as
it
was
the
last
but
one
that
we
should
remain
at
senegal
but
from
what
i
overheard
i
made
up
my
mind
that
i
would
not
go
about
an
hour
before
sunset
i
complained
of
headache
and
sickness
and
sat
down
under
the
awning
over
the
after
part
of
the
when
the
captain
came
up
to
go
on
shore
he
asked
me
if
i
was
ready
but
i
made
no
answer
only
put
my
hand
to
my
head
the
captain
supposing
that
i
was
about
to
be
attacked
by
the
fever
of
the
country
was
much
concerned
and
desired
the
second
mate
to
help
him
to
take
me
down
to
the
and
then
went
on
shore
the
boat
was
as
usual
pulled
by
the
four
men
who
were
prisoners
with
me
and
whom
the
captain
found
he
could
trust
on
shore
better
than
the
others
belonging
to
the
crew
who
would
indulge
in
liquor
whenever
they
had
an
opportunity
i
remained
in
my
till
it
was
nearly
eight
and
then
crept
softly
up
the
to
ascertain
who
was
on
deck
the
men
were
all
below
in
the
at
their
suppers
and
as
i
had
before
observed
that
their
conferences
were
held
on
the
forecastle
i
went
forward
and
covered
myself
up
with
a
part
of
the
which
the
men
had
been
repairing
during
the
day
from
this
position
i
could
hear
all
that
passed
whether
they
went
down
into
the
or
remained
to
converse
on
the
forecastle
about
ten
minutes
afterwards
i
heard
the
boat
grate
against
the
ship
side
and
the
men
of
the
slaver
mount
on
the
deck
all
right
inquired
one
of
the
slavers
yes
replied
our
second
mate
skipper
and
his
men
are
on
shore
and
the
first
mate
taken
with
the
fever
all
the
better
replied
another
one
less
to
handle
and
now
my
lads
let
to
business
and
have
everything
settled
so
that
we
may
not
be
seen
together
any
more
till
the
work
is
done
they
then
commenced
a
consultation
by
which
i
found
it
was
arranged
that
our
ship
was
to
be
boarded
and
taken
possession
of
as
soon
as
she
was
a
few
miles
out
of
the
bay
for
they
dared
not
attack
us
while
we
were
at
anchor
close
to
the
fort
but
the
second
mate
and
eight
men
belonging
to
us
were
to
pretend
to
make
resistance
until
beaten
down
below
and
when
the
vessel
was
in
their
power
the
captain
i
and
the
other
four
men
who
were
ashore
in
the
boat
were
to
be
silenced
for
ever
after
which
there
came
on
a
discussion
as
to
what
was
to
be
done
with
the
cargo
which
was
very
valuable
and
how
the
money
was
to
be
shared
out
when
the
cargo
was
sold
then
they
settled
who
were
to
be
officers
on
board
of
the
ship
which
there
is
no
doubt
they
intended
to
make
a
pirate
vessel
i
also
discovered
that
if
they
succeeded
it
was
their
intention
to
kill
their
own
captain
and
such
men
of
the
slaver
who
would
not
join
them
and
scuttle
their
own
vessel
which
was
a
very
old
one
the
consultation
ended
by
a
solemn
and
most
villainous
oath
being
administered
to
every
man
as
to
secrecy
and
fidelity
after
which
the
men
of
the
slaver
went
into
their
boat
and
pulled
to
their
own
vessel
the
second
mate
and
our
men
remained
on
deck
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
then
all
descended
by
the
ladder
to
the
and
turned
into
their
hammocks
as
soon
as
i
thought
i
could
do
so
with
safety
i
came
out
of
my
and
retreated
to
the
it
was
fortunate
that
i
did
for
a
minute
afterwards
i
heard
a
man
on
deck
and
the
second
mate
came
down
the
and
inquired
whether
i
wanted
anything
i
told
him
no
that
i
was
very
ill
and
only
hoped
to
be
able
to
go
to
sleep
and
asked
him
if
the
captain
had
returned
he
replied
that
he
had
not
and
then
went
away
as
soon
as
i
was
left
to
myself
i
began
to
consider
what
would
be
best
to
be
done
i
knew
the
captain
to
be
a
very
timorous
man
and
i
was
afraid
to
trust
him
with
the
secret
as
i
thought
he
would
be
certain
to
let
the
men
know
by
his
conduct
that
they
were
discovered
and
their
plans
known
the
four
men
who
were
prisoners
with
me
i
knew
that
i
could
confide
in
this
was
the
tuesday
night
and
we
proposed
sailing
on
the
thursday
now
we
had
no
means
of
defence
on
board
except
one
small
gun
which
was
and
nearly
useless
it
did
very
well
to
make
a
signal
with
but
had
it
been
loaded
with
ball
i
believe
it
would
have
burst
immediately
it
is
true
that
we
had
muskets
and
cutlasses
but
what
use
would
they
have
been
against
such
a
force
as
would
be
opposed
and
of
our
men
mutineers
of
course
we
must
have
been
immediately
overpowered
that
the
slavers
intended
to
take
possession
of
their
own
vessel
before
they
took
ours
i
had
no
doubt
it
is
true
that
we
outsailed
them
when
we
had
a
breeze
but
the
bay
was
usually
becalmed
and
it
was
not
till
a
vessel
had
got
well
into
the
offing
that
she
obtained
a
breeze
and
there
was
no
doubt
but
that
they
would
take
the
opportunity
of
boarding
us
when
we
were
moving
slowly
through
the
water
and
a
boat
might
easily
come
up
with
us
the
slaver
had
stated
his
intention
of
sailing
immediately
to
procure
her
cargo
elsewhere
and
if
she
got
under
weigh
at
the
same
time
that
we
did
no
suspicion
would
be
created
to
apply
for
protection
to
the
governor
would
be
useless
he
could
not
protect
us
after
we
were
clear
of
the
bay
indeed
if
it
were
known
that
we
had
so
done
it
would
probably
only
precipitate
the
affair
and
we
should
be
taken
possession
of
while
at
anchor
for
the
shot
from
the
fort
would
hardly
reach
us
it
was
therefore
only
by
stratagem
that
we
could
escape
from
the
clutches
of
these
miscreants
again
allowing
that
we
were
to
get
clear
of
the
slavers
we
were
still
in
an
awkward
position
for
supposing
the
captain
to
be
of
any
use
we
should
still
only
be
six
men
against
nine
and
we
might
be
overpowered
by
our
own
crew
who
were
determined
and
powerful
men
all
night
i
lay
on
my
bed
reflecting
upon
what
ought
to
be
done
and
at
last
i
made
up
my
mind
the
next
morning
i
went
on
deck
complaining
very
much
but
stating
that
the
fever
had
left
me
the
was
sent
on
shore
for
more
water
and
i
took
care
that
the
second
mate
and
eight
men
should
be
those
selected
for
the
service
as
soon
as
they
had
shoved
off
i
called
the
other
four
men
on
the
forecastle
and
told
them
what
i
had
overheard
they
were
very
much
astonished
for
they
had
had
no
idea
that
there
was
anything
of
the
kind
going
forward
i
imparted
to
them
all
my
plans
and
they
agreed
to
support
me
in
everything
indeed
they
were
all
brave
men
and
would
have
if
i
had
acceded
to
it
attempted
to
master
and
overpower
the
second
mate
and
the
others
and
make
sail
in
the
night
but
this
i
would
not
permit
as
there
was
a
great
risk
they
perfectly
agreed
with
me
that
it
was
no
use
acquainting
the
captain
and
that
all
we
had
to
do
was
to
get
rid
of
these
men
and
carry
the
vessel
borne
how
we
could
how
that
was
to
be
done
was
the
point
at
issue
one
thing
was
certain
that
it
was
necessary
to
leave
the
bay
that
night
or
it
would
be
too
late
fortunately
there
was
always
a
light
breeze
during
the
night
and
the
nights
were
dark
for
there
was
no
moon
till
three
in
the
morning
by
which
time
we
could
have
gained
the
offing
and
then
we
might
laugh
at
the
slaver
as
we
were
lighter
in
our
heels
the
boat
came
off
with
the
water
about
noon
and
the
men
went
to
dinner
the
captain
had
agreed
to
dine
with
the
governor
and
i
had
been
asked
to
accompany
him
it
was
to
be
our
farewell
dinner
as
we
were
to
sail
the
next
morning
i
had
been
cogitating
a
long
while
to
find
out
how
to
get
rid
of
these
fellows
when
at
last
i
determined
that
i
would
go
on
shore
with
the
captain
and
propose
a
plan
to
the
governor
his
knowledge
of
what
was
about
to
be
attempted
could
do
no
harm
and
i
thought
he
would
help
us
so
i
went
into
the
boat
and
when
we
landed
i
told
the
men
what
i
intended
to
do
as
soon
as
i
arrived
at
the
governor
i
took
an
opportunity
while
the
captain
was
reading
a
book
to
request
a
few
moments
conversation
and
i
then
informed
the
governor
of
the
conspiracy
which
was
afloat
and
when
i
had
so
done
i
pointed
out
to
him
the
propriety
of
saying
nothing
to
the
captain
until
all
was
safe
and
proposed
my
plan
to
him
which
he
immediately
acceded
to
when
he
returned
to
where
the
captain
was
still
reading
he
told
him
that
he
had
a
quantity
of
and
other
valuables
which
he
wished
to
send
to
england
by
his
ship
but
that
he
did
not
wish
to
do
it
openly
as
it
was
supposed
that
he
did
not
traffic
and
that
if
the
captain
would
send
his
on
shore
after
dark
he
would
send
all
the
articles
on
board
with
instructions
to
whom
they
were
to
be
consigned
on
our
arrival
the
captain
of
course
consented
we
bade
the
governor
farewell
about
half
an
hour
before
dark
and
returned
on
board
after
i
had
been
a
few
minutes
on
deck
i
sent
for
the
second
mate
and
told
him
as
a
secret
what
the
governor
proposed
to
do
and
that
he
would
be
required
to
land
after
dark
for
the
goods
telling
him
that
there
was
a
very
large
quantity
of
and
that
he
must
be
very
careful
i
knew
that
this
intelligence
would
please
him
as
it
would
add
to
their
plunder
when
they
seized
the
vessel
and
i
told
him
that
as
we
sailed
at
daylight
he
must
lose
no
time
but
be
on
board
again
as
soon
as
he
could
that
we
might
hoist
in
the
about
eight
in
the
evening
the
boat
with
him
and
the
eight
men
went
on
shore
the
governor
had
promised
to
detain
them
and
ply
them
with
liquor
till
we
had
time
to
get
safe
off
as
soon
as
they
were
out
of
sight
and
hearing
we
prepared
everything
for
getting
under
weigh
the
captain
had
gone
to
his
cabin
but
was
not
in
bed
i
went
down
to
him
and
told
him
i
should
remain
up
till
the
boat
returned
and
see
that
all
was
right
and
that
in
the
mean
time
i
would
get
everything
ready
for
weighing
the
next
morning
and
that
he
might
just
as
well
go
to
bed
now
and
i
would
call
him
to
relieve
me
at
daylight
to
this
arrangement
he
consented
and
in
half
an
hour
i
perceived
that
his
candle
was
out
and
that
he
had
retired
being
now
so
dark
that
we
could
not
perceive
the
slaver
which
lay
about
three
cables
length
from
us
it
was
fairly
to
be
argued
that
she
could
not
see
us
i
therefore
went
forward
and
slipped
the
cable
without
noise
and
sent
men
up
aloft
to
loose
the
sails
there
was
a
light
breeze
sufficient
to
carry
us
about
two
knots
through
the
water
and
we
knew
that
it
would
rather
increase
than
diminish
in
half
an
hour
as
we
were
we
were
under
sail
everything
being
done
without
a
word
being
spoken
and
with
the
utmost
precaution
you
may
imagine
how
rejoiced
we
all
were
when
we
found
that
we
had
manoeuvred
so
well
notwithstanding
we
kept
a
sharp
to
see
if
the
slaver
had
perceived
our
motions
and
had
followed
us
and
the
fear
of
such
being
the
case
kept
us
under
alarm
till
near
daylight
when
the
breeze
blew
strong
and
we
felt
that
we
had
nothing
more
to
dread
as
the
day
broke
we
found
that
we
were
four
or
five
leagues
from
the
anchorage
and
could
not
see
the
lower
masts
of
the
slaver
which
still
remained
where
we
had
left
her
satisfied
that
we
were
secure
i
then
went
down
to
the
captain
and
as
he
lay
in
bed
made
him
acquainted
with
all
that
had
passed
he
appeared
as
if
awakened
from
a
dream
rose
without
making
any
reply
and
hastened
on
deck
when
he
found
out
that
we
were
under
weigh
and
so
far
from
the
land
he
exclaimed
it
must
all
be
true
but
how
shall
we
be
able
to
take
the
ship
home
with
so
few
hands
i
replied
that
i
had
no
fears
on
that
score
and
that
i
would
answer
for
bringing
the
vessel
safe
to
liverpool
but
he
said
at
last
how
is
it
that
i
was
not
informed
of
all
this
i
might
have
made
some
arrangements
with
the
men
yes
sir
i
replied
but
if
you
had
attempted
to
do
so
the
vessel
would
have
been
taken
immediately
but
why
was
i
not
acquainted
with
it
i
want
to
know
he
said
again
i
had
by
this
time
made
up
my
mind
to
the
answer
i
should
give
him
so
i
said
because
it
would
have
placed
a
serious
responsibility
on
your
shoulders
if
as
captain
of
this
vessel
you
had
sailed
to
england
with
such
a
valuable
cargo
and
so
few
hands
the
governor
and
i
therefore
thought
it
better
that
you
should
not
be
placed
in
such
an
awkward
position
and
therefore
we
considered
it
right
not
to
say
a
word
to
you
about
it
now
if
anything
goes
wrong
it
will
be
my
fault
and
not
yours
and
the
owner
can
not
blame
you
when
i
had
said
this
the
captain
was
silent
for
a
minute
or
two
and
then
said
well
i
believe
it
is
all
for
the
best
and
i
thank
you
and
the
governor
too
having
got
over
this
little
difficulty
i
did
not
care
we
made
all
sail
and
steered
homewards
and
after
a
rapid
passage
during
which
we
were
on
deck
day
and
night
we
arrived
very
much
fatigued
at
liverpool
of
course
the
captain
communicated
what
had
occurred
to
the
owner
who
immediately
sent
for
me
and
having
heard
my
version
of
the
story
expressed
his
acknowledgment
for
the
preservation
of
the
vessel
and
to
prove
his
sincerity
he
presented
me
with
fifty
guineas
for
myself
and
ten
for
each
of
the
men
the
cargo
was
soon
landed
and
i
was
again
at
liberty
i
found
captain
levee
in
port
he
had
just
returned
from
another
cruise
and
had
taken
a
rich
prize
he
met
me
with
the
same
cordiality
as
before
and
having
asked
me
for
a
recital
of
what
had
occurred
at
senegal
of
which
he
had
heard
something
from
the
owner
as
soon
as
i
had
finished
he
said
you
are
a
lad
after
my
own
heart
and
i
wish
we
were
sailing
together
i
want
a
like
you
and
if
you
will
go
with
me
say
the
word
and
it
will
be
hard
but
i
will
have
you
i
replied
that
i
was
not
very
anxious
to
be
in
a
privateer
again
and
this
brought
on
a
discourse
upon
what
occurred
when
i
was
in
the
revenge
with
captain
weatherall
well
he
said
at
last
all
this
makes
me
more
anxious
to
have
you
i
like
fair
fighting
and
hate
buccaneering
like
yourself
however
we
will
talk
of
it
another
time
i
am
about
to
start
for
london
what
do
you
say
will
you
join
me
and
we
will
have
some
sport
with
plenty
of
money
you
may
do
anything
in
london
yes
i
replied
but
i
have
not
plenty
of
money
that
shall
make
no
difference
money
is
of
no
use
but
to
spend
it
that
i
know
of
replied
captain
levee
i
have
plenty
for
both
of
us
and
my
purse
is
at
your
service
help
yourself
as
you
please
without
counting
for
i
shall
be
your
enemy
if
you
offer
to
return
it
settled
the
horses
are
all
ready
and
we
will
start
on
wednesday
how
will
you
dress
i
think
it
might
be
better
to
alter
your
costume
now
you
are
going
to
london
you
make
a
pretty
fellow
dress
how
you
will
before
i
give
you
an
answer
to
all
your
kind
proposals
i
must
speak
to
the
owner
captain
levee
of
course
you
must
shall
we
go
there
now
willingly
i
replied
and
we
accordingly
set
off
captain
levee
introduced
the
subject
as
soon
as
we
arrived
at
the
stating
that
he
wanted
me
to
be
of
the
privateer
and
that
i
was
going
to
london
with
him
if
he
had
no
objection
as
for
going
to
london
with
you
for
five
or
six
weeks
captain
levee
there
can
be
no
objection
to
that
replied
the
owner
but
as
for
being
your
that
is
another
question
i
have
a
vessel
now
fitting
out
and
intended
to
offer
the
command
of
it
to
mr
elrington
i
do
so
now
at
once
and
he
must
decide
whether
he
prefers
being
under
your
orders
to
commanding
a
vessel
of
his
own
i
will
decide
that
for
him
replied
captain
levee
he
must
command
his
own
vessel
it
would
be
no
friendship
on
my
part
to
stand
in
the
way
of
his
advancement
i
only
hope
if
she
is
a
privateer
that
we
may
cruise
together
i
can
not
reply
to
that
latter
question
replied
the
owner
her
destination
is
uncertain
but
the
command
of
her
is
now
offered
to
mr
elrington
if
he
will
accept
of
it
before
his
trip
to
the
metropolis
i
replied
that
i
should
with
pleasure
and
returned
the
owner
many
thanks
for
his
kindness
and
after
a
few
minutes
more
conversation
we
took
our
leave
now
i
should
advise
you
said
captain
levee
as
we
walked
towards
his
lodgings
to
dress
as
a
captain
of
a
vessel
of
war
much
in
the
style
that
i
do
you
are
a
captain
and
have
a
right
so
to
do
come
with
me
and
let
me
fit
you
out
i
agreed
with
captain
levee
that
i
could
not
do
better
so
we
went
and
ordered
my
suits
of
clothes
and
purchased
the
other
articles
which
i
required
captain
levee
would
have
paid
for
them
but
i
had
money
sufficient
and
would
not
permit
him
indeed
with
my
pay
and
present
of
fifty
guineas
i
had
upwards
of
seventy
guineas
in
my
purse
and
did
not
disburse
more
than
fifty
in
my
accoutrements
although
my
pistols
and
hanger
were
very
handsome
we
did
not
start
until
three
days
after
the
time
proposed
when
i
found
at
daylight
two
stout
horses
at
the
door
one
for
captain
levee
and
the
other
for
me
we
were
attended
by
two
belonging
to
the
crew
of
the
privateer
commanded
by
captain
levee
powerful
and
determined
men
armed
to
the
teeth
and
mounted
upon
strong
jades
one
carried
the
valise
of
captain
levee
which
was
heavy
with
gold
the
other
had
charge
of
mine
which
was
much
lighter
as
you
may
suppose
we
travelled
for
three
days
without
any
interruption
making
about
thirty
miles
a
day
and
stopping
at
the
hostelries
to
sleep
every
night
on
the
fourth
day
we
had
a
slight
affair
for
as
we
were
mounting
a
hill
towards
the
evening
we
found
our
passage
barred
by
five
fellows
with
crape
masks
who
told
us
to
stand
and
deliver
we
will
replied
captain
levee
firing
his
pistol
and
reining
up
his
horse
at
the
same
time
the
ball
struck
the
man
who
fell
back
on
the
crupper
while
the
others
rushed
forward
my
pistols
were
all
ready
and
i
fired
at
the
one
who
spurred
his
horse
upon
me
but
the
horse
rearing
up
saved
his
master
the
ball
passing
through
the
head
of
the
animal
who
fell
dead
holding
his
rider
a
prisoner
by
the
thigh
which
was
underneath
his
body
our
two
men
had
come
forward
and
ranged
alongside
of
us
at
the
first
attack
but
now
that
two
had
fallen
the
others
finding
themselves
in
a
minority
after
exchanging
shots
turned
their
horses
heads
and
galloped
away
we
would
have
pursued
them
but
captain
levee
said
it
was
better
not
as
there
might
be
more
of
the
gang
near
and
by
pursuing
them
we
might
separate
and
be
cut
off
in
detail
what
shall
we
do
with
these
fellows
asked
our
men
of
captain
levee
leave
them
to
get
off
how
they
can
replied
captain
levee
i
will
not
be
stopped
on
my
journey
by
such
a
matter
as
this
i
dare
say
they
do
deserve
hanging
more
than
half
the
people
we
meet
let
us
push
on
and
get
into
quarters
for
the
night
after
all
mr
elrington
said
captain
levee
to
me
as
we
were
setting
off
it
only
a
little
land
privateering
and
we
must
not
be
too
hard
upon
them
i
confess
madam
when
i
recalled
all
that
i
had
witnessed
on
board
of
the
revenge
that
i
agreed
with
captain
levee
that
these
highwaymen
were
not
worse
than
ourselves
no
other
adventure
occurred
during
our
journey
and
when
we
arrived
in
london
we
directed
our
horses
steps
to
a
fashionable
tavern
in
saint
paul
and
took
possession
of
apartments
and
as
captain
levee
was
we
were
cordially
greeted
and
well
attended
the
tavern
was
in
great
repute
and
resorted
to
by
all
the
wits
and
gay
men
of
the
day
and
i
soon
found
myself
on
intimate
terms
with
a
numerous
set
of
dashing
blades
full
of
life
and
jollity
and
spending
their
money
like
princes
but
it
was
a
life
of
sad
intemperance
and
my
head
ached
every
morning
from
the
excess
of
the
night
before
and
in
our
excursions
in
the
evenings
we
were
continually
in
broils
and
disturbances
and
many
a
broken
head
nay
sometimes
a
severe
wound
was
given
and
received
after
the
first
fortnight
i
felt
weary
of
this
continual
dissipation
and
as
i
was
dressing
a
which
captain
levee
had
received
in
an
affray
i
one
morning
told
him
so
i
agree
with
you
he
replied
that
it
is
all
very
foolish
and
discreditable
but
if
we
live
with
the
gay
and
pretty
fellows
we
must
do
as
they
do
besides
how
could
i
get
rid
of
my
money
which
burns
in
my
pocket
if
i
did
not
spend
as
much
in
one
day
as
would
suffice
for
three
weeks
still
i
would
rather
dress
a
wound
gained
in
an
honourable
contest
with
the
enemy
than
one
received
in
a
night
brawl
and
i
would
rather
see
you
commanding
your
men
in
action
than
reeling
with
other
drunkards
in
search
of
a
quarrel
in
the
streets
i
feel
that
it
is
beneath
me
and
i
sure
that
it
beneath
you
you
are
a
mentor
without
a
beard
replied
captain
levee
but
still
it
requires
no
beard
to
discover
that
i
have
made
an
ass
of
myself
now
what
do
you
say
shall
we
take
lodgings
and
live
more
reputably
for
while
in
this
tavern
we
never
shall
be
able
to
do
so
i
should
prefer
it
to
tell
you
the
honest
truth
i
replied
for
i
have
no
pleasure
in
our
present
life
be
it
so
then
he
replied
i
will
tell
them
that
i
take
lodgings
that
i
may
be
near
to
a
fair
lady
that
will
be
a
good
and
sufficient
excuse
the
next
day
we
secured
lodgings
to
our
satisfaction
and
removed
into
them
leaving
our
horses
and
men
at
the
tavern
we
boarded
with
the
family
and
as
there
were
others
who
did
the
same
we
had
a
very
pleasant
society
especially
as
there
were
many
of
the
other
sex
among
the
boarders
the
first
day
that
we
sat
down
to
dinner
i
found
myself
by
the
side
of
a
young
man
of
pleasing
manners
although
with
much
of
the
coxcomb
in
his
apparel
his
dress
was
very
gay
and
very
expensive
and
he
wore
a
sword
and
diamond
buckles
at
least
so
they
appeared
to
me
as
i
was
not
sufficient
connoisseur
to
distinguish
the
brilliant
from
the
paste
he
was
very
affable
and
talkative
and
before
dinner
was
over
gave
me
the
history
of
many
of
the
people
present
who
is
the
dame
in
the
blue
stomacher
i
inquired
you
mean
the
prettiest
of
the
two
i
suppose
he
replied
that
one
with
the
patches
under
the
eye
she
is
a
widow
having
just
buried
an
old
man
of
sixty
to
whom
she
was
sacrificed
by
her
mother
but
although
the
old
fellow
was
as
rich
as
a
jew
he
found
such
fault
with
the
lady
conduct
that
he
left
all
his
money
away
from
her
this
is
not
generally
known
and
she
takes
care
to
conceal
it
for
she
is
anxious
to
make
another
match
and
she
will
succeed
if
her
funds
which
are
not
great
enable
her
to
carry
on
the
game
a
little
longer
i
was
nearly
taken
in
myself
but
an
intimacy
with
her
cousin
who
hates
her
gave
me
a
knowledge
of
the
truth
she
still
keeps
her
carriage
and
appears
to
be
rolling
in
wealth
but
she
has
sold
her
diamonds
and
wears
paste
and
that
plain
young
person
on
the
other
side
of
her
has
money
and
knows
the
value
of
it
she
requires
for
and
instead
of
referring
you
to
her
father
and
mother
the
little
minx
refers
you
to
her
lawyer
and
man
of
business
ugly
as
she
is
i
would
have
sacrificed
myself
but
she
treated
me
in
that
way
and
upon
my
soul
i
was
not
very
sorry
for
it
for
she
is
dear
at
any
price
and
i
have
since
rejoiced
at
my
want
of
success
who
is
that
elderly
gentleman
with
such
hair
i
inquired
that
replied
my
companion
nobody
exactly
knows
but
i
have
my
idea
i
think
said
he
lowering
his
voice
to
a
whisper
that
he
is
a
catholic
priest
or
a
jesuit
perhaps
and
a
partisan
of
the
house
of
stuart
i
have
my
reasons
for
supposing
so
and
this
i
am
sure
of
which
is
that
he
is
closely
watched
by
the
emissaries
of
government
you
may
remember
madam
how
at
that
time
the
country
was
disturbed
by
the
landing
of
the
pretender
in
the
summer
of
the
year
before
and
the
great
successes
which
he
had
met
with
and
that
the
duke
of
cumberland
had
returned
from
the
army
in
the
low
countries
and
had
marched
to
scotland
has
there
been
any
intelligence
from
scotland
relative
to
the
movements
of
the
armies
i
inquired
we
have
heard
that
the
pretender
had
abandoned
the
siege
of
fort
william
but
nothing
more
and
how
far
the
report
is
true
it
is
hard
to
say
you
military
men
must
naturally
have
a
war
one
way
or
the
other
said
my
companion
in
a
careless
manner
as
to
the
fighting
part
of
the
question
i
replied
i
should
feel
it
a
matter
of
great
indifference
which
side
i
fought
for
as
the
claim
of
both
parties
is
a
matter
of
mere
opinion
indeed
he
said
and
what
may
be
your
opinion
i
have
none
i
think
the
claims
of
both
parties
equal
the
house
of
stuart
lost
the
throne
of
england
on
account
of
its
religion
that
of
hanover
has
been
called
to
the
throne
for
the
same
cause
the
adherents
of
both
are
numerous
at
the
present
moment
and
it
does
not
follow
because
the
house
of
hanover
has
the
strongest
party
that
the
house
of
stuart
should
not
uphold
its
cause
while
there
is
a
chance
of
success
that
is
true
but
if
you
were
to
be
obliged
to
take
one
side
or
the
other
which
would
it
be
by
preference
certainly
i
would
support
the
protestant
religion
in
preference
to
the
catholic
i
am
a
protestant
and
that
is
reason
enough
i
agree
with
you
replied
my
companion
is
your
brave
friend
of
the
same
opinion
i
really
never
put
the
question
to
him
but
i
think
i
may
safely
answer
that
he
is
it
was
fortunate
madam
that
i
replied
as
i
did
for
i
afterwards
discovered
that
this
precious
gossiping
young
man
with
his
rings
and
ribbons
was
no
other
than
a
government
spy
on
the
for
malcontents
certainly
his
disguise
was
good
for
i
never
should
have
imagined
it
from
his
foppish
exterior
and
mincing
manners
we
passed
our
time
much
more
to
my
satisfaction
now
than
we
did
before
escorting
the
ladies
to
the
theatre
and
to
ranelagh
and
the
freedom
with
which
captain
levee
and
i
may
say
i
also
spent
his
money
soon
gave
us
a
passport
to
good
society
about
a
fortnight
afterwards
the
news
arrived
of
the
battle
of
culloden
and
great
rejoicings
were
made
my
foppish
friend
remarked
to
me
yes
now
that
the
hopes
of
the
pretender
are
blasted
and
the
hanoverian
succession
secured
there
are
plenty
who
pretend
to
rejoice
and
be
excessively
loyal
who
if
the
truth
were
known
ought
to
be
quartered
as
traitors
and
i
must
observe
that
the
day
before
the
news
of
the
battle
the
old
gentleman
with
the
hair
was
arrested
and
sent
to
the
tower
and
he
afterwards
suffered
for
high
treason
but
letters
from
the
owner
saying
that
the
presence
of
both
of
us
was
immediately
required
broke
off
this
pleasant
london
party
indeed
the
bag
of
gold
was
running
very
low
and
this
combined
with
the
letter
occasioned
our
breaking
up
three
days
afterwards
we
took
leave
of
the
company
at
the
lodgings
and
there
was
a
tender
parting
with
one
or
two
buxom
young
women
after
which
we
again
mounted
our
steeds
and
set
off
for
liverpool
where
we
arrived
without
any
adventure
worthy
of
narration
chapter
nine
i
am
put
in
command
of
the
am
directed
to
take
four
jacobite
gentlemen
secretly
on
board
run
with
them
to
bordeaux
land
them
in
safety
dine
with
the
governor
meet
with
the
widow
of
the
french
gentleman
i
had
unfortunately
killed
am
insulted
by
her
second
husband
agree
to
fight
with
him
sail
down
the
river
and
prepare
for
action
on
our
arrival
captain
levee
and
i
as
soon
as
we
had
got
rid
of
the
dust
of
travel
called
upon
the
owner
who
informed
us
that
all
the
alterations
in
captain
levee
vessel
which
was
a
large
lugger
of
fourteen
guns
and
a
hundred
and
twenty
men
were
complete
and
that
my
vessel
was
also
ready
for
me
and
manned
but
that
i
had
better
go
on
board
and
see
if
anything
else
was
required
or
if
there
was
any
alteration
that
i
would
propose
captain
levee
and
i
immediately
went
down
to
the
wharf
alongside
of
which
my
vessel
lay
that
we
might
examine
her
now
that
she
was
fitted
out
as
a
vessel
of
war
she
had
been
a
schooner
in
the
spanish
trade
and
had
been
captured
by
captain
levee
who
had
taken
her
out
from
under
a
battery
as
she
lay
at
anchor
having
just
made
her
port
from
a
voyage
from
south
america
being
at
that
time
laden
with
copper
and
cochineal
a
most
valuable
prize
she
had
proved
and
as
she
was
found
to
be
a
surprising
fast
sailer
the
owner
had
resolved
to
fit
her
out
as
a
privateer
she
was
not
a
large
vessel
being
of
about
a
hundred
and
sixty
tons
but
she
was
very
beautifully
built
she
was
now
armed
with
eight
brass
guns
of
a
calibre
of
six
pounds
each
four
howitzers
aft
and
two
cohorns
on
the
taffrail
you
have
a
very
sweet
little
craft
here
elrington
said
captain
levee
after
he
had
walked
all
over
her
and
examined
her
below
and
aloft
she
will
sail
better
than
before
i
should
think
for
she
then
had
a
very
full
cargo
and
now
her
top
hamper
is
a
mere
nothing
did
the
owner
say
how
many
men
you
had
is
i
believe
to
be
our
full
complement
i
replied
and
i
should
think
quite
enough
yes
if
they
are
good
men
and
true
you
may
do
a
great
deal
with
this
vessel
for
you
see
she
draws
so
little
water
that
you
may
run
in
where
i
dare
not
venture
come
we
will
now
return
to
our
lodgings
pack
up
and
each
go
on
board
of
our
vessels
we
have
had
play
enough
now
to
work
again
and
in
good
earnest
i
was
about
to
propose
it
myself
i
replied
for
with
a
new
vessel
officers
and
men
not
known
to
me
the
sooner
i
am
on
board
and
with
them
the
better
it
will
take
some
time
to
get
everything
and
everybody
in
their
places
spoken
like
a
man
who
understands
his
business
replied
captain
levee
i
wonder
whether
we
shall
be
sent
out
together
i
can
only
say
that
i
hope
so
i
replied
as
i
should
profit
much
by
your
experience
and
hope
to
prove
to
you
that
if
necessary
i
shall
not
be
a
bad
second
and
as
i
made
this
reply
we
arrived
at
the
house
where
we
had
lodged
captain
levee
was
a
man
who
when
once
he
had
decided
was
as
rapid
as
lightning
in
execution
he
sent
for
a
dealer
in
horses
concluded
a
bargain
with
him
in
five
minutes
paid
his
lodgings
and
all
demands
upon
him
and
before
noon
we
were
both
on
board
of
our
respective
vessels
but
previous
to
the
seamen
coming
up
for
our
boxes
i
observed
to
him
i
should
wish
levee
that
you
would
let
me
know
if
it
is
only
at
a
rough
guess
what
sum
i
may
be
indebted
to
you
as
i
may
be
fortunate
and
if
so
it
will
be
but
fair
to
repay
you
the
money
although
your
kindness
i
can
not
so
easily
return
i
tell
you
exactly
said
levee
if
i
take
no
prizes
this
cruise
and
you
do
make
money
why
then
we
will
on
our
return
have
another
frolic
somewhere
and
you
shall
stand
treat
that
will
make
us
all
square
if
i
am
not
fortunate
but
if
i
am
i
consider
your
pleasant
company
to
have
more
than
repaid
me
for
any
little
expense
i
may
have
incurred
you
are
very
kind
to
say
that
i
replied
but
i
hope
you
will
be
fortunate
and
not
have
to
depend
upon
me
i
hope
so
too
he
replied
laughing
if
we
come
back
safe
and
sound
we
will
take
a
trip
to
bath
i
am
anxious
to
see
the
place
i
mention
this
conversation
madam
that
i
may
make
you
acquainted
with
the
character
of
captain
levee
and
prove
to
you
how
worthy
a
man
i
had
as
a
companion
it
required
about
ten
days
to
complete
my
little
schooner
with
everything
that
i
considered
requisite
and
the
politeness
of
the
owner
was
extremely
gratifying
we
were
however
but
just
complete
when
the
owner
sent
for
me
in
a
great
hurry
and
having
taken
me
into
a
back
room
next
to
the
he
locked
the
door
and
said
captain
elrington
i
have
been
offered
a
large
sum
to
do
a
service
to
some
unfortunate
people
but
it
is
an
affair
which
for
our
own
sakes
will
demand
the
utmost
secrecy
indeed
you
will
risk
more
than
i
shall
but
at
the
same
time
i
trust
you
will
not
refuse
to
perform
the
service
as
i
shall
lose
a
considerable
advantage
if
you
will
undertake
it
i
shall
not
be
ungrateful
i
replied
that
i
was
bound
to
him
by
many
acts
of
kindness
and
that
he
might
confide
in
my
gratitude
well
then
he
replied
lowering
his
voice
the
fact
is
this
four
of
the
jacobite
party
who
are
hotly
pursued
and
for
whose
heads
a
large
reward
is
offered
have
contrived
to
escape
to
this
port
and
are
here
concealed
by
their
friends
who
have
applied
to
me
to
land
them
at
some
port
in
france
i
understand
i
replied
i
will
cheerfully
execute
the
commission
i
thank
you
captain
elrington
i
expected
no
other
answer
from
you
i
would
not
put
them
on
board
captain
levee
vessel
for
many
reasons
but
at
the
same
time
he
knows
that
he
is
to
sail
and
he
shall
wait
for
you
and
keep
company
with
you
till
you
have
landed
them
after
which
you
may
concert
your
own
measures
with
him
and
decide
whether
you
cruise
together
or
separate
captain
levee
will
of
course
know
that
i
have
them
on
board
certainly
but
it
is
to
conceal
these
people
from
others
in
his
ship
and
not
from
him
that
they
are
put
on
board
of
your
vessel
at
the
same
time
i
confess
i
have
my
private
reasons
as
well
which
i
do
not
wish
to
make
known
you
can
sail
i
can
sail
if
you
wish
i
replied
no
night
will
be
the
time
that
i
have
fixed
at
what
time
will
they
come
on
board
i
can
not
reply
to
that
till
the
fact
is
that
the
government
people
are
on
a
hot
scent
and
there
is
a
vessel
of
war
in
the
offing
i
am
told
ready
to
board
anything
and
everything
which
comes
out
captain
levee
will
sail
morning
and
will
in
all
probability
be
examined
by
the
government
vessel
which
is
i
understand
a
most
rapid
sailer
will
he
submit
to
it
yes
he
must
and
i
have
given
him
positive
orders
not
to
make
the
least
attempt
to
evade
her
or
prevent
a
search
he
will
then
run
to
holyhead
and
there
for
you
to
join
him
and
you
will
proceed
together
to
the
port
which
the
people
taken
on
board
shall
direct
for
that
is
a
part
of
the
agreement
they
have
made
with
me
then
of
course
i
am
to
evade
the
king
vessel
certainly
and
i
have
no
doubt
but
that
you
will
be
able
so
to
do
your
vessel
is
so
fleet
that
there
will
be
little
difficulty
at
all
events
you
will
do
your
best
but
recollect
that
although
you
must
make
every
attempt
to
escape
you
must
not
make
any
attempt
at
resistance
indeed
that
would
be
useless
against
a
vessel
of
such
force
should
you
be
in
a
position
which
might
enable
them
to
board
you
you
must
find
some
safe
for
your
passengers
for
i
hardly
need
say
that
if
taken
with
them
on
board
the
vessel
will
be
confiscated
and
you
will
run
some
danger
of
your
life
i
have
nothing
more
to
say
to
you
just
now
except
that
you
may
give
out
that
captain
levee
sails
and
that
you
are
to
follow
him
in
ten
days
your
powder
is
on
board
yes
i
got
it
on
board
as
soon
as
we
hauled
out
in
the
stream
well
then
you
will
call
here
morning
about
eleven
not
before
and
i
hardly
need
repeat
it
but
i
again
say
secrecy
as
you
value
your
life
as
soon
as
i
had
left
the
owner
i
went
down
to
the
wharf
stepped
into
the
boat
and
went
on
board
captain
levee
vessel
which
i
have
omitted
to
state
was
named
the
arrow
i
found
him
on
board
and
very
busy
getting
ready
for
sea
so
you
are
off
levee
said
i
before
all
the
people
on
the
deck
yes
he
replied
i
wish
i
was
too
but
i
am
to
remain
ten
days
longer
i
find
i
was
in
hopes
we
should
have
cruised
together
replied
captain
levee
but
we
must
do
as
our
owner
wishes
what
detains
you
i
thought
you
were
ready
i
thought
so
too
i
replied
but
we
find
that
the
head
of
the
mainmast
is
sprung
and
we
must
have
a
new
one
i
have
just
come
from
the
owner
and
must
set
to
work
at
once
and
get
ready
for
shifting
our
mast
so
fare
you
well
if
i
do
not
see
you
before
you
sail
i
am
to
see
the
owner
replied
levee
shall
we
not
meet
then
and
take
a
parting
glass
i
fear
not
but
i
will
come
if
i
can
i
replied
if
not
success
to
the
arrow
and
success
to
the
replied
levee
and
god
bless
you
my
good
fellow
i
shook
hands
with
my
kind
friend
and
went
over
the
side
of
the
lugger
into
my
boat
and
then
pulled
for
my
own
vessel
as
soon
as
i
got
on
board
i
sent
for
officers
and
men
and
said
to
them
we
are
to
shift
our
mainmast
for
one
that
is
three
feet
longer
and
must
work
hard
that
we
may
be
able
to
sail
as
soon
as
possible
i
can
not
allow
any
of
you
to
go
on
shore
till
the
work
is
finished
when
it
is
done
you
will
have
leave
as
before
till
we
sail
that
afternoon
i
sent
down
the
and
topmast
unbent
the
mainsail
and
gaff
sent
down
the
topmast
and
on
deck
cast
loose
the
lanyards
of
the
lower
rigging
and
quite
dismantled
the
mainmast
so
as
to
make
it
appear
as
if
we
were
about
to
haul
to
the
wharf
and
take
it
out
the
men
all
remained
on
board
expecting
that
we
should
shift
our
berth
the
next
day
on
the
following
morning
i
laid
out
a
warp
to
the
wharf
as
if
intending
to
haul
in
and
at
the
time
appointed
i
went
on
shore
to
the
owner
and
told
him
what
i
had
done
but
he
said
i
find
that
you
will
have
to
sail
this
night
as
soon
as
it
is
dark
how
will
you
get
ready
i
replied
that
at
nightfall
i
would
immediately
replace
everything
and
in
an
hour
would
be
ready
for
sea
if
such
be
the
case
you
have
done
well
mr
elrington
and
i
thank
you
for
your
zeal
on
my
behalf
which
i
shall
not
forget
everything
has
been
arranged
and
you
must
come
up
here
with
some
of
your
seamen
as
soon
as
you
are
ready
to
sail
your
men
or
rather
four
of
them
must
remain
in
the
house
the
four
gentlemen
who
are
to
be
embarked
will
be
dressed
in
seamen
attire
and
will
carry
down
their
boxes
and
trunks
as
if
they
were
your
men
taking
your
things
on
board
you
will
then
remain
a
little
distance
from
the
wharf
in
the
boat
till
your
own
men
come
down
and
if
there
is
no
discovery
you
will
take
them
on
board
with
you
if
on
the
contrary
there
is
any
suspicion
and
the
officers
of
the
government
are
on
the
watch
and
stop
your
men
you
will
then
push
off
with
the
passengers
slip
your
cable
if
it
is
necessary
and
make
all
sail
for
holyhead
where
you
will
fall
in
with
the
arrow
which
will
be
waiting
there
for
you
is
the
arrow
still
in
sight
no
i
replied
she
was
out
of
sight
more
than
an
hour
ago
and
from
our
masthead
we
could
see
the
topgallant
sails
of
the
vessel
of
war
bearing
keep
a
upon
her
and
see
how
she
bears
at
dark
replied
the
owner
for
you
must
not
fall
in
with
her
if
possible
i
think
you
had
better
return
on
board
now
that
you
may
keep
your
people
quiet
when
i
arrived
on
board
the
schooner
i
told
my
officers
that
i
did
not
think
that
we
should
shift
the
mast
as
proposed
and
that
everything
must
be
got
ready
for
refitting
i
did
not
choose
to
say
more
but
i
added
that
i
was
to
go
on
shore
in
the
evening
to
smoke
a
pipe
with
the
owner
and
then
i
should
know
for
certain
i
employed
the
men
during
the
whole
of
the
day
in
doing
everything
in
preparation
which
could
be
done
without
exciting
suspicion
and
as
soon
as
it
was
dark
i
called
the
men
aft
and
told
them
that
i
thought
it
was
very
likely
from
the
arrow
not
having
made
her
appearance
that
we
might
be
sent
to
join
her
immediately
and
that
i
wished
them
to
rig
the
mainmast
and
make
everything
ready
for
an
immediate
start
promising
them
to
serve
out
some
liquor
if
they
worked
well
this
was
sufficient
and
in
little
more
than
an
hour
the
mast
was
secured
the
rigging
all
complete
and
the
sails
ready
for
bending
i
then
ordered
the
boat
to
be
manned
and
telling
the
officers
that
they
were
to
bend
the
sails
and
have
everything
ready
for
weighing
on
my
return
on
board
which
would
be
in
an
hour
or
thereabouts
i
pulled
on
shore
and
went
up
to
the
owner
taking
four
men
with
me
and
leaving
three
men
in
the
boat
i
ordered
these
three
men
to
remain
till
the
others
came
down
with
my
trunks
and
effects
and
not
to
leave
the
boat
on
any
consideration
when
i
arrived
at
the
owner
i
told
him
what
i
had
done
and
he
commended
my
arrangements
in
the
back
room
i
found
four
gentlemen
dressed
in
seamen
clothing
and
as
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
they
immediately
shouldered
the
trunks
and
valises
desiring
my
own
men
to
remain
with
the
owner
to
bring
down
anything
that
he
might
wish
to
send
on
board
i
left
them
in
the
the
gentlemen
followed
me
with
their
loads
down
to
the
boat
and
when
i
got
there
the
men
told
me
that
some
people
had
come
down
and
asked
whose
boat
it
was
and
why
they
were
lying
there
and
that
they
had
told
the
people
that
the
captain
had
taken
four
men
with
him
to
bring
down
his
things
and
that
they
were
waiting
for
him
so
it
was
lucky
that
i
said
to
my
men
what
i
did
we
hastened
to
put
the
trunks
into
the
boat
and
to
get
in
ourselves
after
we
had
received
this
intelligence
and
then
i
shoved
off
from
the
wharf
and
laid
about
a
stone
throw
distant
for
my
other
men
at
last
we
heard
them
coming
down
and
shortly
afterwards
we
perceived
that
they
were
stopped
by
other
people
and
in
altercation
with
them
i
knew
then
that
the
officers
were
on
the
alert
and
would
discover
the
stratagem
and
therefore
desired
my
men
and
the
gentlemen
who
had
each
taken
an
oar
in
readiness
to
give
way
and
pull
for
the
schooner
as
we
did
so
the
king
officers
on
search
who
had
stopped
my
four
men
came
down
to
the
wharf
and
ordered
us
to
come
back
but
we
made
no
reply
as
soon
as
we
were
alongside
we
hoisted
the
things
out
of
the
boat
veered
her
astern
by
a
slipped
the
cable
and
made
sail
fortunately
it
was
very
dark
and
we
were
very
alert
in
our
movements
we
could
perceive
lights
at
the
wharf
as
we
sailed
out
of
the
river
and
it
was
clear
that
we
had
had
a
narrow
escape
but
i
felt
no
alarm
on
account
of
the
owner
as
i
knew
that
although
they
might
suspect
they
could
prove
nothing
when
about
three
miles
out
we
hoisted
in
the
boat
and
shaped
our
course
all
i
had
now
to
fear
was
the
falling
in
with
the
ship
of
war
in
the
offing
and
i
placed
men
to
keep
a
sharp
in
every
direction
and
told
the
officers
that
it
was
necessary
that
we
should
avoid
her
when
last
seen
about
an
hour
before
dark
she
was
well
to
windward
and
as
the
wind
was
from
the
northward
she
would
probably
sail
faster
than
we
could
as
a
schooner
does
not
sail
so
well
free
as
on
a
wind
we
had
run
out
about
four
hours
and
were
steering
our
course
for
holyhead
when
suddenly
we
perceived
the
ship
of
war
close
to
us
and
to
leeward
she
had
been
lying
with
her
mainsail
to
the
mast
but
she
evidently
had
made
us
out
for
she
filled
and
set
sails
i
immediately
hauled
my
wind
and
as
soon
as
she
had
way
she
tacked
and
followed
in
pursuit
being
then
right
astern
of
us
about
half
a
mile
off
it
was
very
dark
and
i
knew
that
as
our
sails
were
set
and
we
bore
from
her
it
would
be
difficult
for
her
to
keep
us
in
sight
as
we
only
presented
what
we
call
the
of
our
sails
to
her
i
therefore
steered
on
under
all
sail
and
finding
that
the
schooner
weathered
on
her
i
kept
her
away
a
little
so
as
to
retain
the
same
bearings
and
to
leave
her
faster
in
an
hour
we
could
not
make
out
the
ship
and
were
therefore
certain
that
she
could
not
see
us
so
as
i
wanted
to
get
clear
of
her
and
be
at
holyhead
as
soon
as
possible
i
lowered
down
all
the
sails
and
put
my
helm
up
so
as
to
cross
her
and
run
to
leeward
under
bare
poles
while
she
continued
her
windward
chase
this
stratagem
answered
and
we
saw
no
more
of
her
for
two
hours
afterwards
we
fell
in
with
the
arrow
and
hailing
her
we
both
made
sail
down
the
bristol
channel
as
fast
as
we
could
and
at
daybreak
there
was
no
vessel
in
sight
and
of
course
we
had
nothing
more
to
fear
from
the
liverpool
cruiser
as
we
now
sailed
rapidly
along
in
company
with
the
wind
on
our
quarter
it
was
high
time
for
me
to
look
to
my
passengers
who
had
remained
on
deck
in
perfect
silence
from
the
time
that
they
had
come
on
board
i
therefore
went
up
to
them
and
apologised
for
not
having
as
yet
paid
them
that
attention
that
i
should
have
wished
to
have
done
under
other
circumstances
captain
replied
the
oldest
of
them
with
a
courteous
salute
you
have
paid
us
every
attention
you
have
been
extremely
active
in
saving
our
lives
and
we
return
you
our
sincere
thanks
yes
indeed
replied
a
young
and
handsome
man
who
stood
next
him
mr
elrington
has
saved
us
from
the
toils
of
our
enemies
but
now
that
we
are
in
no
fear
from
that
quarter
i
must
tell
him
that
we
have
hardly
had
a
mouthful
of
food
for
hours
and
if
he
wishes
to
save
our
lives
a
second
time
it
will
be
by
ordering
a
good
breakfast
to
be
prepared
for
us
campbell
speaks
the
truth
my
dear
sir
said
the
one
who
had
first
spoken
we
have
lately
gained
the
knowledge
of
what
it
is
to
hunger
and
thirst
and
we
all
join
in
his
request
you
shall
not
wait
long
i
replied
i
will
be
up
again
in
a
moment
or
two
i
went
down
into
the
cabin
and
ordering
my
servant
to
put
on
the
table
a
large
piece
of
pressed
hamburg
beef
a
cold
pie
of
various
flesh
and
fowl
combined
some
bread
and
cheese
and
some
bottles
of
brandy
and
usquebaugh
i
then
went
up
again
and
requested
them
all
to
descend
hungry
they
certainly
were
and
it
was
incredible
the
quantity
that
they
devoured
i
should
have
imagined
that
they
had
not
been
fed
for
a
week
and
i
thought
that
if
they
were
to
consume
at
that
rate
my
stock
would
never
last
out
and
the
sooner
they
were
landed
the
better
as
soon
as
they
left
off
eating
and
had
finished
two
bottles
of
usquebaugh
i
said
to
them
gentlemen
my
orders
are
to
land
you
at
any
port
of
france
that
you
should
prefer
have
you
made
up
your
minds
as
to
which
it
shall
be
for
it
will
be
necessary
that
we
shape
a
course
according
to
your
decision
mr
elrington
on
that
point
we
would
wish
to
advise
with
you
i
hardly
need
say
that
our
object
is
to
escape
and
that
falling
in
with
and
being
captured
by
a
ship
of
war
and
there
are
many
out
in
pursuit
of
us
and
other
unfortunate
adherents
to
the
house
of
stuart
would
be
extremely
disagreeable
as
our
heads
and
our
bodies
would
certainly
part
company
if
we
were
taken
now
which
port
do
you
think
we
should
be
most
likely
to
reach
with
least
chance
of
interruption
i
think
i
replied
as
you
pay
me
the
compliment
to
ask
my
opinion
that
it
would
be
better
to
run
down
the
bay
of
biscay
and
then
put
in
the
port
of
bordeaux
or
any
other
where
you
could
be
landed
in
safety
and
my
reason
is
this
the
channel
is
full
of
cruisers
looking
after
those
of
your
party
who
are
attempting
to
escape
and
my
vessel
will
be
chased
and
searched
now
although
we
might
sail
faster
than
any
one
vessel
in
the
channel
yet
it
is
very
possible
that
in
running
away
from
one
we
may
fall
into
the
jaws
of
another
and
besides
we
are
two
privateers
and
cruising
off
bordeaux
will
excite
no
suspicion
as
it
is
a
favourite
so
that
if
we
were
boarded
there
would
be
little
danger
of
discovery
but
of
course
as
long
as
i
can
prevent
that
by
taking
to
my
heels
i
shall
not
be
boarded
by
any
one
the
only
objection
to
what
i
propose
is
that
you
will
be
confined
longer
in
a
vessel
than
you
may
like
or
than
you
would
be
if
you
were
to
gain
a
nearer
port
i
agree
with
the
captain
of
the
vessel
said
a
personage
who
had
not
yet
spoken
and
whom
i
afterwards
discovered
to
be
a
catholic
priest
the
staunchest
adherent
to
the
cause
could
not
have
given
better
advice
and
i
should
recommend
that
it
be
followed
the
others
were
of
the
same
opinion
and
in
consequence
i
edged
the
schooner
down
to
the
arrow
and
hailed
captain
levee
stating
that
we
were
to
run
to
bordeaux
after
that
i
prepared
for
them
sleeping
accommodations
as
well
as
i
could
and
on
my
making
apologies
they
laughed
and
told
me
such
stories
of
their
hardships
during
their
escape
that
i
was
not
surprised
at
their
not
being
difficult
i
found
out
their
names
by
their
addressing
one
another
to
be
campbell
mcintyre
ferguson
and
mcdonald
all
of
them
very
refined
gentlemen
and
of
excellent
discourse
they
were
very
merry
and
laughed
at
all
that
they
had
suffered
sang
jacobite
songs
as
they
were
termed
and
certainly
did
not
spare
my
locker
of
wine
the
wind
continued
fair
and
we
met
with
no
interruption
and
on
the
fourth
evening
at
dusk
we
made
the
mouth
of
the
garonne
and
with
our
heads
off
shore
for
the
night
captain
levee
then
came
on
board
and
i
introduced
him
to
my
passengers
to
my
surprise
after
some
conversation
he
said
i
have
now
escorted
captain
elrington
according
to
the
orders
i
received
and
shall
return
to
liverpool
as
soon
as
possible
if
therefore
gentlemen
you
have
any
letters
to
send
to
your
friends
announcing
your
safety
i
shall
be
most
happy
to
present
them
in
any
way
you
may
suggest
as
most
advisable
that
captain
levee
had
some
object
in
saying
this
i
was
quite
certain
and
therefore
i
made
no
remark
the
passengers
thanked
him
for
his
proposal
and
being
provided
with
writing
materials
they
all
wrote
to
their
friends
and
put
their
letters
into
captain
levee
hands
who
then
bade
them
farewell
and
went
on
deck
with
me
of
course
you
were
not
serious
in
what
you
said
captain
levee
i
inquired
as
we
walked
forward
no
he
replied
but
i
considered
it
prudent
to
make
them
believe
so
although
englishmen
they
are
enemies
to
our
country
so
far
as
they
are
enemies
to
our
government
and
of
course
wish
no
harm
to
the
french
who
have
so
warmly
supported
them
now
if
they
knew
that
i
remained
here
waiting
for
your
coming
out
of
the
river
they
would
say
so
and
i
might
lose
the
chance
of
a
good
prize
as
nothing
would
sail
if
they
knew
that
the
coast
was
not
clear
now
i
shall
part
company
with
you
in
an
hour
and
make
all
sail
for
england
as
they
may
suppose
but
without
fail
night
i
shall
be
off
here
again
about
five
leagues
from
the
port
with
my
sails
furled
therefore
stay
in
the
river
as
long
as
they
will
let
you
as
while
you
are
in
port
with
the
flag
of
truce
vessels
may
sail
out
i
understand
you
and
will
do
all
i
can
to
assist
your
views
captain
levee
now
we
will
go
down
again
i
will
give
you
a
receipt
for
a
coil
of
rope
which
you
will
send
your
boat
for
and
write
a
letter
to
the
owners
after
which
you
will
wish
me
good
bye
and
make
sail
exactly
captain
levee
replied
who
then
ordered
his
boat
to
go
for
a
coil
of
and
bring
it
on
board
we
then
descended
to
the
cabin
and
i
wrote
a
letter
to
the
owner
and
also
a
receipt
for
the
coil
of
rope
which
i
delivered
to
captain
levee
the
boat
soon
returned
from
the
lugger
the
rope
was
taken
on
board
and
then
captain
levee
wished
me
farewell
and
made
his
polite
adieus
to
the
gentlemen
who
followed
him
on
deck
and
waited
there
till
he
had
hoisted
in
his
boat
and
made
all
sail
how
long
will
she
be
before
she
arrives
at
liverpool
with
this
wind
inquired
mr
campbell
she
will
carry
her
canvass
night
and
day
i
replied
and
therefore
as
she
sails
so
fast
i
should
say
in
five
or
six
days
well
i
am
grateful
that
we
have
such
an
early
and
safe
opportunity
of
communicating
with
our
friends
in
england
we
might
have
waited
two
months
otherwise
very
true
replied
the
priest
but
heaven
has
assisted
our
anxious
wishes
let
us
be
grateful
for
all
things
my
passengers
watched
the
lugger
until
she
was
nearly
out
of
sight
i
dare
say
that
their
thoughts
were
that
those
on
board
of
her
were
going
to
the
country
of
their
birth
from
which
they
were
exiles
probably
for
ever
they
did
not
speak
but
went
down
below
and
retired
to
their
beds
at
daylight
the
next
morning
i
ran
the
schooner
in
and
as
soon
as
i
was
within
three
miles
of
the
coast
i
hoisted
the
white
flag
of
truce
and
stood
for
the
mouth
of
the
river
garonne
i
perceived
that
the
batteries
were
manned
but
not
a
shot
was
fired
and
we
entered
the
river
when
we
were
a
mile
up
the
river
we
were
boarded
by
the
french
authorities
and
my
passengers
who
had
dressed
themselves
in
their
proper
costume
informed
the
officer
in
the
boat
who
they
were
upon
which
he
was
very
polite
and
calling
a
pilot
out
of
the
boat
the
schooner
was
taken
charge
of
by
him
and
we
very
soon
afterwards
having
wind
and
tide
in
our
favour
were
anchored
alongside
of
two
large
merchant
vessels
and
a
french
privateer
of
sixteen
guns
which
i
instantly
recognised
as
our
old
antagonist
off
hispaniola
in
the
action
in
which
the
revenge
was
captured
and
captain
weatherall
lost
his
life
however
i
kept
my
knowledge
to
myself
as
the
french
officer
and
the
jacobite
gentlemen
were
present
as
soon
as
we
had
anchored
the
passengers
were
requested
to
go
into
the
boat
and
the
french
officer
and
i
to
accompany
them
that
i
might
report
myself
to
the
governor
and
we
pulled
away
to
the
town
one
of
my
boats
following
with
the
passengers
luggage
on
our
landing
there
was
a
great
crowd
assembled
and
they
looked
very
hard
at
me
as
i
was
dressed
in
my
lace
coat
and
a
hat
also
bound
with
broad
gold
lace
on
our
arrival
in
the
presence
of
the
governor
we
were
received
with
much
urbanity
and
as
i
had
brought
the
jacobite
gentlemen
in
my
schooner
it
was
presumed
that
i
was
favourable
to
the
cause
and
i
was
very
politely
treated
the
governor
invited
us
all
to
dine
with
him
on
that
day
i
made
some
excuse
saying
that
i
was
anxious
to
return
to
liverpool
that
i
might
fit
out
for
the
coast
of
africa
in
which
service
i
was
to
be
employed
by
my
owners
but
the
passengers
insisted
upon
my
staying
a
day
or
two
and
the
governor
added
to
their
solicitations
his
own
i
therefore
accepted
not
only
because
i
was
glad
to
have
an
opportunity
to
see
so
celebrated
a
town
but
because
it
would
meet
the
views
of
captain
levee
we
took
leave
of
the
governor
and
went
to
an
hotel
and
i
then
sent
my
boat
on
board
for
necessaries
and
hired
a
handsome
apartment
in
the
hotel
i
had
not
been
there
half
an
hour
when
the
priest
came
to
me
and
said
captain
you
are
not
aware
of
the
rank
and
consequence
of
the
three
gentlemen
whom
you
have
been
so
successful
in
escorting
to
a
place
of
safety
i
am
requested
by
them
to
make
you
a
handsome
remuneration
for
your
kindness
and
skilful
conduct
on
this
occasion
sir
i
replied
this
must
not
be
i
am
most
happy
in
having
assisted
in
the
escape
of
unfortunate
gentlemen
and
all
the
pleasure
i
feel
at
having
so
done
would
be
destroyed
if
i
were
to
accept
of
what
you
offer
it
is
useless
to
repeat
it
and
if
you
do
i
shall
consider
it
an
insult
and
immediately
repair
on
board
of
my
vessel
you
will
therefore
tender
my
best
thanks
and
my
refusal
with
ardent
wishes
for
their
future
welfare
after
what
you
have
said
captain
elrington
i
will
of
course
not
resume
the
offer
i
will
tell
my
what
you
have
said
and
i
am
sure
that
they
will
as
i
do
admire
your
high
sense
of
honour
the
priest
shook
me
by
the
hand
and
then
quitted
my
apartment
i
did
not
see
the
other
passengers
till
it
was
the
hour
to
go
to
dine
at
the
governor
when
they
embraced
me
cordially
and
the
one
calling
himself
campbell
said
should
you
ever
be
in
distress
or
a
prisoner
in
this
country
recollect
you
have
a
friend
who
is
ready
to
serve
you
here
is
an
address
to
a
lady
to
whom
you
must
write
and
say
that
you
wish
the
assistance
of
your
passenger
to
bordeaux
that
will
be
sufficient
i
trust
you
may
never
require
it
we
had
a
pleasant
dinner
at
the
governor
and
among
the
people
invited
to
meet
us
i
perceived
the
french
captain
of
the
privateer
i
knew
him
immediately
although
he
did
not
recognise
me
we
had
some
conversation
together
and
he
spoke
about
his
cruises
in
the
west
indies
and
asked
me
whether
i
knew
captain
weatherall
i
said
there
was
a
captain
weatherall
who
commanded
the
revenge
privateer
and
who
was
killed
when
his
vessel
was
taken
exactly
said
the
captain
he
was
a
brave
man
and
fought
nobly
and
so
did
all
his
people
they
fought
like
devils
yes
i
replied
they
fought
as
long
as
they
could
but
captain
weatherall
was
very
he
had
but
men
on
board
at
the
commencement
of
the
action
more
than
that
i
sure
replied
the
french
captain
he
had
not
i
assure
you
i
replied
he
had
lost
so
many
in
an
attack
on
shore
and
had
so
many
away
in
prizes
our
conversation
had
attracted
general
notice
and
a
french
army
officer
observed
monsieur
speaks
so
positively
that
one
would
imagine
that
he
was
actually
on
board
and
so
i
was
sir
replied
i
and
have
my
wounds
to
show
for
it
i
knew
this
officer
immediately
i
saw
him
for
i
was
close
to
captain
weatherall
at
the
time
that
this
officer
expostulated
with
him
before
the
action
and
i
crossed
my
sword
with
him
during
the
combat
you
have
convinced
me
that
you
were
on
board
replied
the
captain
of
the
privateer
by
your
mentioning
the
expostulations
previous
to
the
combat
taking
place
i
am
delighted
to
have
met
with
so
brave
an
enemy
for
every
man
on
board
that
vessel
was
a
hero
the
conversation
was
then
general
and
many
particulars
were
asked
and
i
will
do
the
french
captain
the
justice
to
say
that
he
was
very
correct
in
all
his
statements
and
neither
vaunted
his
own
success
nor
did
us
less
than
justice
the
party
then
broke
up
to
go
to
the
theatre
and
afterwards
we
repaired
to
the
hotel
i
remained
there
two
days
more
and
on
the
last
of
these
two
days
i
had
promised
to
sup
with
the
french
captain
of
the
privateer
who
had
called
upon
me
and
behaved
very
politely
the
following
day
after
noon
when
the
tide
served
i
was
to
sail
accordingly
after
the
theatre
was
over
i
went
with
the
french
captain
to
his
house
in
company
with
two
or
three
more
supper
was
on
the
table
when
we
arrived
there
and
we
went
into
the
room
waiting
for
the
presence
of
the
captain
lady
who
had
not
gone
to
the
theatre
and
to
whom
i
had
not
been
introduced
after
a
few
minutes
she
made
her
appearance
and
as
she
entered
the
room
i
was
struck
with
her
extreme
beauty
although
she
was
past
the
meridian
of
life
i
thought
i
had
seen
her
face
before
and
as
she
came
forward
with
her
husband
it
at
once
rushed
into
my
mind
that
she
was
the
widow
of
the
french
gentleman
who
had
so
gallantly
fought
his
vessel
and
who
fell
by
my
hand
the
lady
who
was
nursing
her
son
at
the
king
hospital
at
jamaica
and
who
had
been
so
inveterate
against
me
our
eyes
met
and
her
cheeks
flushed
she
recognised
me
and
i
coloured
deeply
as
i
bowed
to
her
she
was
taken
with
a
faintness
and
fell
back
fortunately
her
husband
received
her
in
his
arms
what
is
the
matter
my
love
he
said
nothing
but
i
am
taken
with
a
vertigo
replied
she
it
will
go
off
directly
make
my
excuses
to
the
company
while
i
retire
for
a
few
minutes
her
husband
went
out
of
the
room
and
after
a
minute
or
two
came
back
saying
that
madam
was
not
well
enough
to
return
to
the
room
and
begged
that
they
would
admit
her
excuse
and
sit
down
to
supper
without
her
whether
his
wife
had
informed
him
of
who
i
was
i
know
not
but
nothing
could
exceed
the
civility
of
the
french
captain
towards
me
during
the
supper
we
did
not
however
remain
very
late
as
the
lady
of
the
house
was
indisposed
i
found
out
as
i
walked
home
with
another
french
officer
that
the
captain
of
the
privateer
had
fallen
in
with
the
french
lady
on
her
return
from
jamaica
where
her
son
died
in
the
hospital
and
had
married
her
and
that
moreover
unlike
most
french
husbands
he
was
most
ardently
attached
to
her
i
had
breakfasted
the
next
morning
and
packed
up
my
clothes
preparatory
to
going
on
board
and
had
just
returned
from
a
visit
of
with
the
governor
when
who
should
walk
up
into
my
apartment
but
the
french
captain
of
the
privateer
accompanied
by
three
or
four
french
officers
of
the
army
i
perceived
by
his
looks
when
he
entered
that
he
was
a
little
excited
but
i
met
him
cordially
he
began
a
conversation
about
his
action
with
captain
weatherall
and
instead
of
speaking
handsomely
as
he
had
done
before
he
used
expressions
which
i
considered
offensive
and
i
at
once
took
him
up
by
observing
that
being
under
a
flag
of
truce
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
notice
what
he
said
no
he
replied
but
i
wish
we
were
once
more
on
the
high
seas
together
for
i
have
a
little
debt
of
gratitude
to
pay
off
well
i
replied
you
may
have
and
i
should
not
be
sorry
to
give
you
an
opportunity
if
it
were
possible
may
i
inquire
whether
you
intend
to
go
home
as
a
cartel
and
carry
your
flag
of
truce
to
liverpool
no
sir
i
replied
i
shall
haul
down
my
flag
of
truce
as
soon
as
i
am
out
of
of
your
batteries
i
understand
what
you
mean
sir
it
is
very
true
that
your
vessel
carries
nearly
double
the
number
of
guns
that
mine
does
but
nevertheless
i
shall
haul
down
my
flag
of
truce
as
i
say
i
will
not
if
i
follow
you
down
the
river
i
presume
he
said
with
a
sort
of
sneer
follow
me
if
you
dare
i
cried
you
will
meet
with
your
master
depend
upon
it
sacre
replied
he
in
a
passion
i
will
blow
you
out
of
the
water
and
if
i
take
you
i
will
hang
you
for
a
pirate
not
the
last
certainly
i
said
coolly
look
you
sir
he
cried
shutting
his
fist
upon
the
palm
of
his
other
hand
if
i
take
you
i
will
hang
you
and
if
you
take
me
you
may
serve
me
in
the
same
way
is
it
a
bargain
or
are
you
a
coward
gentlemen
i
said
to
the
officers
present
you
must
feel
that
your
countryman
is
not
behaving
well
he
has
insulted
me
grossly
i
will
however
consent
to
his
terms
on
one
condition
which
is
that
he
will
permit
one
of
you
after
he
has
sailed
to
make
known
the
conditions
upon
which
we
fight
to
his
wife
and
that
one
of
you
will
pledge
me
his
honour
that
he
will
impart
these
conditions
as
soon
as
we
are
gone
agree
to
do
so
pledge
yourself
to
do
so
xavier
cried
the
french
captain
to
one
of
the
officers
present
since
you
wish
it
certainly
he
said
you
pledge
yourself
to
make
the
conditions
known
to
madam
as
soon
as
we
have
sailed
i
do
upon
the
honour
of
an
officer
and
a
gentleman
replied
he
painful
as
it
will
be
to
me
then
captain
i
replied
i
agree
to
your
conditions
and
one
or
the
other
of
us
shall
hang
you
may
suppose
madam
that
i
must
have
been
in
a
state
of
great
irritation
to
have
consented
to
such
terms
i
was
so
and
could
not
brook
such
insult
in
the
presence
of
the
french
officers
moreover
as
you
will
observe
in
my
conversation
i
did
not
commit
myself
in
any
way
there
was
nothing
dishonourable
i
told
him
that
i
should
haul
down
my
flag
of
truce
and
i
also
told
him
that
he
would
meet
with
his
master
which
was
true
enough
as
he
would
meet
with
the
arrow
commanded
by
captain
levee
as
well
as
with
my
vessel
while
he
thought
that
he
would
have
to
fight
with
my
inferior
vessel
alone
and
making
sure
of
conquest
he
purposely
insulted
me
to
make
me
accept
such
conditions
as
would
administer
to
the
revenge
of
his
wife
who
had
evidently
worked
him
up
to
act
in
such
a
manner
and
i
accepted
them
because
i
hoped
the
fate
would
be
his
if
captain
levee
joined
me
and
if
not
i
was
determined
that
i
never
would
be
taken
alive
after
i
had
agreed
to
his
conditions
they
all
took
a
very
ceremonious
leave
and
i
bowed
them
out
with
great
mock
humility
i
then
bade
farewell
to
my
passengers
who
lodged
in
the
same
hotel
and
went
down
to
my
boat
and
pulled
on
board
as
soon
as
the
tide
served
the
pilot
came
on
board
and
we
got
under
weigh
i
observed
a
great
bustle
and
a
hurrying
to
and
fro
of
boats
on
board
of
the
french
privateer
and
we
had
not
gone
above
two
miles
down
the
river
before
i
perceived
the
men
were
aloft
and
lowering
her
sails
i
told
my
officers
that
i
had
received
a
challenge
from
the
french
privateer
and
had
accepted
it
and
that
we
must
get
everything
ready
for
action
they
were
much
astonished
at
this
as
the
disparity
of
force
was
so
great
but
they
went
cheerfully
to
their
duty
as
did
the
men
among
whom
the
news
was
soon
spread
chapter
ten
captain
levee
and
i
engage
with
the
french
privateer
we
come
off
victorious
my
revenge
against
the
french
lady
we
take
our
prize
to
liverpool
the
wind
was
light
and
we
did
not
gain
the
mouth
of
the
river
till
near
when
the
pilot
left
us
and
as
soon
as
we
were
three
miles
in
the
offing
i
hauled
down
the
flag
of
truce
in
the
sight
of
the
french
privateer
who
was
following
us
close
and
was
not
more
than
four
miles
from
us
to
avoid
mistake
i
had
agreed
with
captain
levee
that
should
i
be
coming
out
after
dark
i
would
carry
a
light
at
the
peak
and
this
light
i
now
hoisted
it
enabled
the
french
privateer
to
follow
me
and
appeared
only
as
a
mark
of
contempt
towards
him
i
stood
on
in
the
direction
where
i
was
to
find
captain
levee
and
could
make
out
the
frenchman
following
me
and
gradually
nearing
me
as
it
became
dark
i
made
more
sail
to
keep
him
further
off
till
i
had
joined
the
arrow
but
the
light
at
my
peak
pointed
out
to
him
where
i
was
all
this
seemed
a
mystery
to
my
officers
and
men
until
having
run
out
about
four
leagues
i
desired
them
to
keep
a
sharp
for
the
arrow
about
eight
we
perceived
her
she
had
furled
her
sails
after
dark
as
usual
the
light
i
bore
told
her
who
i
was
and
i
ran
close
to
her
and
hailing
captain
levee
desired
him
to
prepare
for
action
and
that
i
would
come
on
board
to
speak
to
him
this
of
course
created
a
great
bustle
on
board
of
the
arrow
and
i
hastened
on
board
that
they
might
not
show
any
lights
i
then
informed
captain
levee
of
all
that
had
passed
and
that
the
frenchman
was
not
more
than
five
miles
from
us
we
agreed
that
i
should
still
keep
up
the
light
and
bear
away
a
little
to
draw
the
frenchman
to
leeward
of
the
port
and
also
to
leeward
of
the
arrow
that
the
arrow
should
lower
her
sails
again
so
as
not
to
be
perceived
until
i
had
drawn
the
frenchman
past
him
and
that
then
i
should
commence
the
action
under
sail
and
fight
till
the
arrow
came
up
to
my
assistance
this
being
arranged
i
hastened
on
board
of
my
schooner
and
keeping
away
four
points
i
waited
for
the
coming
up
of
my
antagonist
in
half
an
hour
we
could
perceive
him
through
the
gloom
not
more
than
a
mile
from
us
under
all
sail
standing
steadily
for
the
light
which
we
carried
at
our
peak
as
i
had
already
discovered
that
my
little
schooner
sailed
faster
than
my
opponent
i
allowed
her
to
come
up
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
me
when
i
and
desiring
my
men
to
aim
at
his
rigging
so
as
to
dismantle
him
poured
in
my
broadside
of
grape
and
langridge
and
then
shifted
my
helm
and
resumed
my
course
putting
more
sail
on
so
as
to
increase
my
distance
to
what
it
was
before
this
manoeuvre
i
executed
three
times
with
success
and
i
had
the
satisfaction
of
perceiving
that
his
was
shot
away
but
when
i
the
fourth
time
he
did
the
same
and
we
exchanged
broadsides
the
effect
of
his
superior
artillery
was
evident
for
my
rigging
and
sails
were
much
damaged
happily
nothing
so
serious
as
to
impede
our
speed
and
i
again
put
before
the
breeze
as
before
and
increased
my
distance
previous
to
again
for
as
the
water
was
very
smooth
i
knew
that
if
i
was
crippled
she
would
lay
me
by
the
board
immediately
and
i
might
be
taken
and
hanged
before
the
arrow
could
come
up
to
my
assistance
i
therefore
continued
a
running
fight
at
such
a
distance
as
rendered
me
less
liable
to
suffer
from
his
guns
it
is
true
that
this
distance
made
my
guns
even
more
ineffective
but
i
was
decoying
my
frenchman
off
from
the
land
and
placing
the
arrow
between
him
and
his
port
so
that
his
return
would
be
intercepted
this
continued
for
about
an
hour
when
i
perceived
that
the
frenchman
had
got
up
a
new
and
had
set
the
sail
upon
it
he
now
ran
out
his
and
continued
to
fire
upon
me
with
them
alone
not
choosing
to
lose
ground
by
to
give
me
a
broadside
and
as
his
canvass
was
all
out
and
i
was
occasionally
to
dismantle
him
we
retained
much
the
same
distance
from
one
another
at
last
a
shot
from
his
struck
off
the
head
of
my
mainmast
and
my
gaff
came
down
this
was
serious
we
hastened
to
reef
the
mainsail
and
hoist
it
up
again
upon
the
remainder
of
the
mast
but
having
no
our
speed
was
necessarily
decreased
and
the
enemy
appeared
to
be
gradually
closing
with
us
i
looked
out
for
the
arrow
but
could
perceive
no
signs
of
her
indeed
it
was
too
dark
to
see
farther
than
half
a
mile
finding
that
on
the
point
of
sailing
we
were
on
i
had
no
chance
i
determined
to
alter
my
course
and
put
my
schooner
right
before
the
wind
so
that
i
might
set
the
square
mainsail
which
would
give
time
for
the
arrow
to
arrive
indeed
at
this
time
i
was
in
a
state
of
great
anxiety
however
i
had
made
up
my
mind
not
to
be
taken
alive
and
to
sell
my
life
as
dearly
as
i
could
when
the
enemy
perceived
that
we
had
put
before
the
wind
he
did
the
same
and
as
we
were
about
half
a
mile
from
each
other
we
continued
to
exchange
broadsides
as
we
ran
she
gradually
nearing
us
so
as
to
make
her
heavy
artillery
more
effective
this
portion
of
the
contest
continued
for
an
hour
during
which
my
little
schooner
had
received
much
injury
and
we
were
constantly
repairing
damages
at
last
much
to
my
delight
the
day
began
to
dawn
and
i
then
discovered
the
arrow
about
a
mile
and
a
half
from
us
right
astern
under
a
press
of
sail
i
pointed
her
out
to
my
officers
and
men
who
were
inspired
with
fresh
courage
at
the
sight
the
enemy
also
perceived
her
and
appeared
determined
to
bring
the
combat
to
an
issue
previous
to
her
coming
up
and
i
feared
that
at
all
events
i
might
swing
at
the
let
the
issue
of
the
coming
combat
be
what
it
might
she
neared
steering
a
course
so
as
to
cut
me
off
and
i
continued
to
pour
in
my
broadsides
to
cripple
her
if
possible
as
she
did
not
now
fire
but
ran
steadily
for
me
and
my
chances
were
bad
anxious
that
the
arrow
should
close
as
soon
as
possible
i
hauled
down
my
square
mainsail
that
we
might
not
run
from
her
and
prepared
for
an
obstinate
resistance
if
boarded
at
last
the
frenchman
was
within
a
cable
length
and
at
this
critical
moment
the
arrow
was
about
a
mile
to
windward
we
poured
in
our
last
broadside
and
hastened
to
seize
our
pikes
and
cutlasses
to
repel
the
boarders
when
to
my
satisfaction
i
found
that
one
of
our
shot
had
cut
his
gaff
in
two
i
immediately
rounded
to
the
wind
and
as
my
antagonist
was
within
of
me
with
her
men
all
ready
for
the
leap
on
board
i
put
my
helm
down
went
round
in
stays
and
crossed
her
so
near
to
windward
that
you
might
have
thrown
a
biscuit
on
board
this
manoeuvre
prevented
his
boarding
and
i
may
say
saved
my
life
for
his
gaff
being
shot
away
he
could
not
heave
in
stays
to
follow
me
but
was
obliged
to
wear
round
after
me
which
increased
his
distance
at
least
a
cable
length
to
leeward
a
furious
broadside
however
which
he
poured
in
crippled
me
altogether
everything
came
running
down
upon
the
decks
and
i
was
left
a
complete
wreck
but
i
was
to
windward
of
him
and
although
he
might
sink
me
he
could
not
board
or
take
possession
until
he
had
refitted
his
but
now
his
time
was
come
a
fresh
antagonist
with
equal
weight
of
metal
was
close
to
him
and
he
had
to
decide
whether
he
would
fight
or
run
whether
he
conceived
that
running
was
useless
which
it
certainly
was
or
was
determined
to
take
us
both
or
die
i
know
not
certain
it
is
that
he
did
not
put
his
vessel
before
the
wind
but
waited
with
determination
the
coming
up
of
the
arrow
captain
levee
passed
under
the
frenchman
stern
raking
him
with
a
broadside
that
almost
unrigged
him
and
then
engaged
him
to
leeward
so
as
to
cut
off
all
chance
of
his
escape
the
frenchman
returned
the
fire
with
spirit
and
i
took
my
men
from
my
guns
that
we
might
set
some
sail
upon
the
vessel
for
after
the
arrow
commenced
her
fire
no
further
notice
was
taken
of
me
by
the
frenchman
after
a
contest
well
maintained
for
half
an
hour
the
mainmast
of
the
frenchman
went
by
the
board
and
this
almost
settled
the
question
as
he
could
not
keep
his
vessel
to
the
wind
and
consequently
she
fell
off
and
received
a
raking
fire
from
the
arrow
at
last
her
bowsprit
was
between
the
main
and
fore
rigging
of
the
arrow
and
her
decks
were
swept
by
the
arrow
raking
fire
i
had
got
some
sail
up
forward
and
was
anxious
to
be
at
the
close
of
the
action
i
perceived
that
the
frenchman
was
attempting
to
board
the
lugger
and
was
pouring
all
his
people
on
the
forecastle
and
i
therefore
edged
down
to
him
that
i
might
with
my
people
board
him
on
the
quarter
which
would
place
him
as
we
say
between
two
fires
the
conflict
was
at
its
highest
the
french
attempting
and
the
arrow
crew
repelling
them
when
i
laid
my
schooner
on
her
quarter
and
leaped
on
board
of
her
with
my
few
remaining
men
the
frenchmen
turned
to
repel
my
attack
and
thus
weakened
their
party
opposed
to
the
arrow
men
the
consequence
was
that
they
were
first
beaten
back
and
then
boarded
by
captain
levee
and
his
crew
as
soon
as
i
had
gained
the
deck
of
the
frenchman
i
thought
of
nothing
but
to
single
out
the
french
captain
at
first
i
could
not
see
him
but
as
his
crew
retreated
from
captain
levee
and
his
men
i
perceived
him
pale
and
exhausted
but
still
attempting
to
rally
them
as
my
object
was
to
take
him
alive
i
rushed
in
advance
at
him
wrestled
and
threw
him
on
his
back
on
the
deck
there
i
held
him
while
the
combatants
fighting
and
retreating
tumbled
over
us
one
after
another
and
bruised
us
severely
with
their
weight
at
last
the
french
were
beaten
below
and
i
had
time
to
breathe
calling
to
two
of
my
men
i
desired
them
to
take
charge
of
the
french
captain
and
as
they
valued
their
lives
not
to
let
him
escape
or
destroy
himself
but
to
take
him
into
our
vessel
and
guard
him
carefully
in
my
cabin
having
done
this
i
went
to
captain
levee
and
we
embraced
you
did
not
come
a
minute
too
soon
i
said
wiping
the
blood
from
my
face
no
indeed
and
but
for
your
clever
manoeuvre
you
would
have
been
beaten
your
vessel
is
a
mere
nutshell
compared
to
this
you
did
well
more
than
well
to
maintain
the
combat
so
long
have
you
lost
many
men
we
had
ten
sent
below
before
we
boarded
what
may
have
followed
since
i
do
not
know
i
have
the
french
captain
safe
in
my
cabin
i
saw
the
men
hand
him
over
well
now
to
repair
damages
and
then
i
will
tell
you
what
you
shall
do
i
must
send
on
board
and
help
you
the
arrow
has
not
suffered
much
considering
and
i
can
spare
the
men
as
soon
as
we
have
cleared
up
the
decks
a
little
we
will
breakfast
together
and
talk
the
matter
over
it
required
two
hours
before
we
could
clear
the
decks
of
our
vessels
for
we
had
separated
and
the
arrow
had
taken
charge
of
the
prize
before
i
took
the
boat
to
go
on
board
the
arrow
i
went
down
into
my
cabin
where
the
french
captain
lay
bound
and
watched
by
two
of
the
men
you
are
prepared
to
pay
the
penalty
agreed
upon
monsieur
said
i
i
am
sir
he
replied
i
now
understand
what
you
meant
when
you
said
that
i
should
meet
with
my
match
i
have
no
one
to
blame
but
myself
i
urge
you
to
the
conditions
expecting
an
easy
and
certain
conquest
with
my
superior
vessel
i
have
fallen
into
my
own
net
and
there
an
end
of
the
matter
except
that
when
things
go
wrong
a
woman
is
certain
to
be
at
the
bottom
of
it
i
am
aware
sir
i
replied
that
your
wife
instigated
you
to
act
as
you
did
or
you
would
never
have
so
behaved
in
attempting
to
revenge
the
death
of
one
husband
she
has
lost
two
replied
the
frenchman
composedly
and
i
then
quitted
the
cabin
and
went
on
board
of
the
arrow
well
elrington
said
captain
levee
what
do
you
intend
to
do
with
the
french
captain
is
he
to
pay
the
forfeit
and
awing
at
the
i
do
like
hanging
a
man
especially
a
brave
man
in
cold
blood
i
replied
it
was
all
his
wife
doing
and
he
has
confessed
as
much
he
would
certainly
have
hanged
you
replied
levee
yes
that
i
believe
but
it
would
have
been
that
he
might
have
a
quiet
life
at
home
not
from
any
resentment
against
me
now
i
have
no
feeling
of
that
kind
to
actuate
me
what
will
you
do
then
not
hang
him
certainly
and
yet
i
should
like
to
punish
her
she
deserves
it
replied
captain
levee
now
elrington
will
you
approve
of
my
suggestion
let
me
hear
it
it
is
this
they
do
not
know
that
i
have
assisted
in
taking
the
privateer
as
they
have
no
idea
that
i
am
here
as
soon
as
we
have
refitted
her
and
your
vessel
i
will
remain
where
i
am
you
shall
run
into
the
mouth
of
the
garonne
with
your
colours
flying
and
the
english
jack
over
the
french
flag
on
board
of
the
prize
this
will
lead
them
to
suppose
that
you
have
taken
the
vessel
without
assistance
when
just
out
of
fire
a
gun
and
then
swing
an
effigy
to
the
and
remain
there
to
make
them
suppose
that
you
have
hung
the
french
captain
at
nightfall
you
can
make
sail
and
rejoin
me
that
will
punish
her
and
annoy
them
generally
i
will
do
so
it
is
an
excellent
device
and
she
will
never
know
the
truth
for
a
long
time
to
come
we
remained
all
that
day
refitting
in
the
evening
i
made
sail
in
company
with
the
french
schooner
which
was
manned
by
captain
levee
and
stood
in
shore
at
break
of
the
following
day
i
ran
in
standing
for
the
harbour
without
my
colours
being
hoisted
and
then
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
would
make
their
disappointment
greater
by
allowing
them
first
to
imagine
that
the
victory
was
theirs
so
when
about
six
miles
off
i
hoisted
french
colours
on
the
french
schooner
and
french
colours
over
english
on
board
of
my
own
i
continued
to
stand
on
till
within
two
miles
and
a
half
of
the
batteries
and
could
see
crowds
flocking
down
to
witness
the
supposed
triumphant
arrival
of
their
privateer
into
port
when
of
a
sudden
i
hauled
my
wind
brailed
up
my
sails
and
changed
the
colours
firing
a
gun
in
bravado
allowing
them
half
an
hour
to
comment
upon
this
disappointment
i
then
fired
another
gun
and
hoisted
up
to
the
the
figure
of
a
man
composed
of
clothes
stuffed
with
hay
made
to
represent
the
french
captain
and
having
so
done
i
remained
during
the
whole
forenoon
with
my
sails
brailed
up
that
they
might
have
a
clear
view
of
the
hanging
figure
at
last
we
perceived
a
large
boat
with
a
flag
of
truce
coming
out
of
the
river
i
remained
where
i
was
and
allowing
it
to
come
alongside
i
perceived
in
it
the
french
officer
who
had
pledged
himself
to
give
the
conditions
of
the
combat
to
the
lady
and
seated
by
him
was
the
french
captain
wife
with
her
head
sunk
down
on
her
knees
and
her
face
buried
in
her
handkerchief
i
saluted
the
officer
as
he
came
on
deck
he
returned
my
bow
and
then
said
sir
the
fortune
of
war
has
proved
in
your
favour
and
i
perceive
that
the
conditions
of
the
issue
of
the
combat
have
been
adhered
to
on
your
side
against
that
i
have
not
a
word
to
say
as
my
friend
would
have
as
rigidly
adhered
to
them
but
sir
we
war
not
with
the
dead
and
i
have
come
off
at
the
request
of
his
miserable
wife
to
beg
that
you
will
now
that
your
revenge
is
satisfied
deliver
up
to
her
her
husband
body
that
it
may
receive
the
rites
of
the
church
and
christian
burial
you
surely
as
a
brave
man
will
not
deny
this
small
favour
to
a
woman
whom
you
have
twice
deprived
of
her
husband
sir
i
replied
on
condition
that
his
lady
will
step
on
board
and
make
the
request
herself
i
will
comply
with
it
but
on
no
other
terms
it
will
be
most
painful
and
her
feelings
might
well
have
been
spared
such
a
trial
as
to
meet
your
face
again
and
make
the
request
in
person
but
as
you
insist
upon
it
i
will
make
known
your
terms
as
he
went
into
his
boat
i
ran
down
into
the
cabin
and
desired
them
to
cast
loose
the
french
captain
saying
to
him
sir
your
wife
is
here
requesting
your
body
which
she
believes
to
be
swinging
at
the
for
i
have
put
that
trick
into
execution
to
punish
her
i
never
intended
to
take
your
life
and
i
shall
now
do
more
i
shall
give
you
not
only
life
but
liberty
such
shall
be
my
revenge
the
french
captain
stared
as
if
confounded
but
made
no
reply
i
then
went
on
deck
where
i
found
the
lady
had
been
lifted
up
the
side
they
led
her
to
me
and
she
fell
on
her
knees
but
the
effort
was
too
much
for
her
and
she
fainted
away
i
ordered
her
to
be
taken
down
into
the
cabin
and
without
any
explanation
desired
the
french
officer
to
accompany
her
not
wishing
to
be
present
at
the
unexpected
meeting
i
therefore
remained
on
deck
and
ordering
the
men
to
lower
down
the
effigy
they
did
so
laughing
at
the
french
seamen
in
the
boat
who
for
the
first
time
perceived
for
they
had
not
looked
up
before
that
it
was
only
a
sham
captain
i
looked
over
the
side
and
told
them
that
the
captain
was
alive
and
well
and
would
be
in
the
boat
very
soon
at
which
they
were
greatly
rejoiced
in
the
mean
time
the
explanation
took
place
in
the
cabin
and
after
a
few
minutes
the
french
officer
came
up
and
expressed
his
satisfaction
at
what
i
had
done
you
have
given
a
lesson
sir
without
being
guilty
of
barbarity
your
conduct
has
been
noble
he
was
soon
followed
by
the
french
captain
and
his
lady
who
was
now
all
gratitude
and
would
have
kissed
my
hands
but
i
prevented
her
and
said
madam
at
least
now
you
have
no
occasion
to
hate
me
if
i
was
so
unfortunate
in
as
to
slay
your
first
husband
i
have
restored
to
you
your
second
let
us
then
part
in
amity
the
french
captain
squeezed
my
hand
but
said
nothing
i
begged
they
would
take
some
refreshment
but
they
were
too
anxious
to
return
and
undeceive
their
friends
and
requested
permission
to
go
into
the
boat
of
course
i
consented
and
as
the
boat
pulled
away
the
crew
gave
three
huzzas
as
a
compliment
to
us
when
they
were
a
mile
in
shore
i
hauled
down
the
colours
of
both
vessels
and
made
sail
out
to
rejoin
captain
levee
which
i
did
in
the
evening
and
then
related
all
that
had
passed
he
was
much
pleased
with
the
result
of
the
affair
and
we
then
having
consulted
considered
it
advisable
to
run
back
to
liverpool
with
the
prize
for
she
required
so
many
hands
to
man
her
as
to
render
us
by
no
means
efficient
vessels
moreover
i
have
omitted
to
state
that
while
i
was
in
the
garonne
the
arrow
had
taken
two
good
prizes
which
she
had
manned
and
sent
to
liverpool
we
therefore
made
sail
to
the
northward
and
in
a
week
were
again
in
port
with
our
prize
we
found
that
the
other
vessels
had
arrived
safe
and
the
owner
was
much
pleased
with
the
result
of
this
short
and
eventful
cruise
chapter
eleven
i
cause
myself
to
be
dismissed
from
my
owner
service
am
arrested
conveyed
to
london
and
confined
in
the
tower
am
visited
by
a
romish
priest
and
through
his
interference
obtain
my
liberation
set
off
to
liverpool
and
find
my
owner
and
captain
levee
their
surprise
miss
trevannion
when
i
called
upon
our
owner
which
i
did
as
soon
as
i
had
dropped
my
anchor
and
furled
sails
he
embraced
me
and
then
led
me
into
the
back
room
next
to
his
my
dear
elrington
said
he
well
as
you
managed
to
get
off
the
jacobite
gentlemen
there
is
a
strong
suspicion
on
the
part
of
the
government
that
they
were
on
board
of
your
vessel
and
that
i
was
a
party
to
their
escape
whether
they
will
take
any
measures
now
that
you
have
returned
i
know
not
they
may
have
gained
some
intelligence
or
they
may
worm
out
something
by
their
emissaries
from
those
who
compose
your
crew
and
if
so
we
must
expect
their
vengeance
now
tell
me
where
you
landed
them
and
all
the
events
of
your
cruise
for
i
have
heard
but
little
from
those
who
brought
in
the
prizes
taken
by
the
arrow
captain
levee
is
too
busy
with
his
own
vessel
and
the
prize
to
come
on
shore
for
these
two
hours
and
i
wish
to
talk
with
you
alone
upon
this
affair
after
i
had
narrated
all
that
had
passed
and
the
manner
in
which
the
french
privateer
had
been
captured
the
owner
said
if
the
government
spies
and
there
are
plenty
of
them
about
find
out
from
your
crew
that
you
landed
passengers
at
bordeaux
depend
upon
it
you
will
be
arrested
and
examined
without
you
get
out
of
the
way
till
the
affair
has
blown
over
now
the
men
will
narrate
in
the
taverns
the
curious
history
of
this
french
privateer
and
in
so
doing
can
not
fail
to
state
that
you
were
on
shore
in
france
now
elrington
you
have
run
the
risk
to
oblige
me
and
i
must
keep
you
out
of
difficulty
and
if
you
feel
inclined
to
hide
yourself
for
a
time
i
will
of
course
pay
all
your
expenses
no
i
replied
if
they
find
out
what
has
taken
place
and
wish
to
get
hold
of
me
in
consequence
i
think
it
will
be
better
to
brave
it
out
if
i
hide
away
it
will
make
them
more
anxious
to
have
me
and
will
confirm
their
suspicions
that
i
am
what
they
are
pleased
to
call
a
traitor
a
reward
will
be
offered
for
my
apprehension
and
at
any
time
that
i
do
appear
the
reward
will
cause
me
to
be
taken
up
if
on
the
contrary
i
brave
it
out
and
if
i
am
asked
say
at
once
that
i
did
land
passengers
at
all
events
they
will
not
make
it
high
treason
so
with
your
leave
i
will
stay
i
hardly
need
say
that
i
shall
take
the
whole
responsibility
on
myself
and
declare
that
i
took
them
on
board
without
your
knowledge
that
you
may
rest
assured
of
on
consideration
i
think
that
your
plan
is
the
best
replied
my
owner
i
am
grateful
for
your
offer
of
screening
me
which
i
would
not
permit
were
it
not
that
i
shall
be
useful
to
you
if
any
mischance
takes
place
and
if
in
prison
could
be
of
no
service
then
sir
i
replied
the
wisest
course
will
be
for
you
at
once
to
dismiss
me
from
the
command
of
the
privateer
in
consequence
of
your
having
been
informed
that
i
carried
passengers
and
landed
them
in
france
that
step
will
prove
you
a
friend
to
the
government
and
will
enable
you
after
a
time
to
get
me
out
of
my
scrape
more
effectually
you
are
sacrificing
yourself
elrington
and
all
for
me
not
so
sir
i
am
only
securing
a
friend
in
case
of
need
that
you
certainly
are
replied
my
owner
squeezing
my
hand
well
it
will
be
the
best
plan
even
for
you
and
so
let
it
be
then
i
will
now
return
on
board
and
tell
the
officers
that
i
am
dismissed
there
is
no
time
to
be
lost
and
here
comes
captain
levee
so
for
the
present
sir
farewell
on
my
return
on
board
i
called
up
the
officers
and
men
and
told
them
that
i
had
offended
the
owner
and
that
he
had
dismissed
me
from
the
command
of
the
privateer
one
of
the
officers
inquired
what
i
had
done
and
i
said
before
the
men
that
it
was
for
landing
the
passengers
in
france
they
all
condoled
with
me
and
expressed
their
sorrow
at
my
leaving
them
and
i
believe
they
were
sincere
it
was
fortunate
that
i
did
as
i
had
done
for
i
found
that
the
government
emissaries
were
on
board
at
the
time
that
i
made
the
communication
and
had
already
gained
the
information
from
some
of
my
crew
i
ordered
my
chest
and
bedding
to
be
put
into
the
boat
and
as
soon
as
they
were
ready
i
gave
up
the
command
to
the
first
officer
and
bidding
them
all
farewell
went
down
the
side
and
pulled
on
shore
repairing
to
my
former
lodgings
i
had
not
been
there
two
hours
before
i
was
arrested
and
taken
to
prison
i
was
however
very
comfortably
lodged
because
i
was
a
and
i
presume
that
more
respect
is
paid
to
a
man
when
he
is
to
be
drawn
and
quartered
and
his
head
set
above
the
tower
gates
than
a
petty
malefactor
the
next
day
i
was
summoned
before
what
was
called
the
commission
and
asked
whether
i
had
not
landed
some
people
in
france
i
replied
immediately
that
i
had
done
so
who
were
they
was
the
next
inquiry
they
stated
themselves
to
be
roman
catholic
priests
replied
i
and
such
i
believed
them
to
be
why
did
i
do
so
because
in
the
first
place
they
paid
me
one
hundred
guineas
each
and
in
the
second
because
i
considered
them
mischievous
dangerous
men
conspiring
against
the
government
and
that
the
sooner
they
were
out
of
the
country
the
better
how
did
i
know
that
they
were
traitors
all
roman
priests
were
traitors
in
my
opinion
and
i
hated
them
as
bad
as
i
did
the
french
but
it
is
difficult
to
deal
with
a
priest
and
i
thought
that
i
was
performing
a
good
service
in
ridding
the
country
of
them
who
else
was
privy
to
the
affair
no
one
i
had
made
the
arrangement
with
them
myself
and
not
an
officer
or
man
on
board
knew
anything
about
it
but
my
owner
mr
trevannion
was
he
a
party
to
it
no
he
was
not
and
on
my
return
he
dismissed
me
from
the
command
of
the
privateer
as
soon
as
he
found
out
that
i
had
landed
the
priests
in
france
a
great
many
more
questions
were
put
to
me
all
of
which
i
answered
very
cautiously
yet
without
apparent
hesitation
and
after
an
examination
of
four
hours
the
president
of
the
commission
told
me
that
i
had
been
by
my
own
acknowledgment
aiding
and
abetting
the
escape
of
malignant
traitors
and
prevented
them
meeting
their
just
fate
on
the
scaffold
that
in
so
doing
i
had
been
guilty
of
treason
and
must
abide
the
sentence
of
the
supreme
commission
in
london
whither
i
should
be
sent
the
following
day
i
replied
that
i
was
a
loyal
subject
that
i
hated
the
french
and
romish
plotters
and
that
i
had
done
what
i
considered
was
best
that
if
i
had
done
wrong
it
was
only
an
error
in
judgment
and
any
one
that
said
i
was
a
traitor
lied
in
his
throat
my
reply
was
taken
down
and
i
was
sent
back
to
prison
the
following
afternoon
the
gaoler
came
into
my
room
accompanied
by
two
persons
one
of
whom
informed
me
that
i
was
delivered
over
to
their
custody
to
be
taken
to
london
i
was
led
out
and
at
the
door
i
found
three
horses
upon
one
of
which
i
was
desired
to
mount
as
soon
as
i
was
in
the
saddle
a
rope
was
passed
from
one
leg
to
the
other
under
the
horse
belly
so
as
to
prevent
my
escape
and
my
horse
was
led
between
the
other
two
upon
which
my
keepers
rode
each
having
a
made
fast
from
my
horse
bridle
to
his
own
a
crowd
was
assembled
round
the
entrance
of
the
gaol
and
among
the
i
perceived
captain
levee
and
my
owner
but
of
course
i
thought
it
imprudent
to
take
any
notice
of
them
and
they
did
not
make
any
recognition
of
me
i
hardly
need
say
my
dear
madam
how
very
revolting
it
was
to
my
feelings
to
be
thus
led
away
like
a
felon
but
at
the
same
time
i
must
acknowledge
the
courtesy
of
my
conductors
who
apologised
for
being
compelled
to
take
such
measures
of
security
and
on
the
way
showed
great
kindness
and
everything
being
arranged
we
proceeded
on
our
journey
but
it
was
late
when
we
set
off
owing
to
one
of
my
conductors
being
sent
for
by
the
commissioner
and
having
to
wait
for
letters
for
nearly
three
hours
as
it
may
be
supposed
we
could
not
travel
at
speed
and
we
seldom
went
faster
than
a
walk
which
i
was
sorry
for
as
i
was
anxious
that
the
journey
should
be
over
and
my
fate
decided
as
soon
as
possible
almost
an
hour
after
dark
a
party
of
men
rushed
from
the
side
of
the
road
and
some
seizing
the
bridles
of
the
horses
the
others
threw
the
two
conductors
off
their
saddles
by
taking
them
by
the
leg
and
heaving
them
over
on
the
other
side
this
was
done
so
quickly
that
the
two
men
who
were
well
armed
had
not
time
to
draw
out
a
pistol
or
any
other
weapon
of
defence
and
as
soon
as
they
were
on
the
ground
they
were
immediately
seized
and
overpowered
the
faces
of
the
men
who
had
thus
assailed
the
king
officers
were
blackened
so
as
to
disguise
them
but
from
their
voices
i
knew
them
to
be
the
men
and
officers
of
the
privateer
now
then
captain
elrington
said
one
of
them
be
off
with
you
as
fast
as
possible
and
we
will
take
care
of
these
fellows
i
still
remained
in
my
saddle
and
although
somewhat
flurried
with
the
surprise
of
the
attack
i
had
had
time
to
recover
myself
and
had
decided
upon
my
mode
of
behaviour
i
felt
as
i
had
said
to
the
owner
when
we
consulted
together
that
an
escape
now
would
be
only
putting
off
the
evil
day
and
that
it
was
better
to
meet
the
case
boldly
at
once
so
i
rose
in
my
stirrups
and
said
to
the
men
in
a
loud
voice
my
good
fellows
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
your
exertions
in
my
behalf
as
it
proves
your
but
i
can
not
and
will
not
take
advantage
of
them
by
some
mistake
i
am
accused
of
being
a
traitor
when
i
feel
that
i
am
a
true
and
loyal
subject
which
i
have
no
doubt
will
be
fully
established
upon
my
arrival
in
london
i
can
not
therefore
take
advantage
of
this
opportunity
to
escape
i
respect
the
laws
of
my
country
and
i
beg
you
to
do
the
same
oblige
me
by
releasing
the
two
gentlemen
whom
you
have
made
your
prisoners
and
assist
them
to
remount
their
horses
for
i
am
resolved
that
i
will
go
to
london
and
be
honourably
acquitted
once
more
my
lads
many
thanks
for
your
kind
intentions
and
now
i
wish
you
farewell
and
if
you
would
do
me
a
great
favour
you
will
disperse
peaceably
and
leave
us
to
proceed
on
our
journey
the
men
perceived
that
i
was
in
earnest
and
therefore
did
as
i
requested
and
in
another
minute
i
was
again
alone
with
my
two
keepers
you
have
behaved
honourably
sir
and
perhaps
wisely
observed
one
of
my
conductors
as
he
was
about
to
remount
his
horse
i
will
not
ask
you
who
those
people
were
although
i
have
no
doubt
but
you
recognised
them
yourself
no
i
replied
i
did
not
i
guessed
from
whence
they
came
but
i
did
not
recognise
any
one
individual
i
gave
this
cautious
answer
although
i
had
recognised
captain
levee
and
one
of
my
own
officers
well
captain
elrington
you
have
proved
to
us
that
you
may
be
trusted
and
therefore
on
your
pledging
your
word
that
you
will
not
escape
we
shall
have
a
great
pleasure
in
removing
all
unpleasant
precautions
i
certainly
have
proved
that
i
would
not
escape
and
will
readily
give
you
my
assurance
that
i
will
not
alter
my
mind
that
is
sufficient
sir
replied
the
officer
and
he
then
cut
away
the
rope
which
bound
my
legs
and
also
took
off
the
two
leading
reins
attached
to
the
other
horses
we
shall
now
he
said
proceed
not
only
more
pleasantly
but
more
rapidly
my
conductors
then
mounted
their
horses
and
we
set
off
at
a
good
trot
and
in
an
hour
arrived
at
the
place
where
we
were
to
put
up
for
the
night
we
found
supper
prepared
for
us
and
good
beds
my
conductors
now
left
me
free
of
all
restraint
and
we
retired
to
our
beds
the
next
day
we
continued
our
journey
in
the
same
manner
my
companions
were
pleasant
and
gentlemanlike
men
and
we
discoursed
freely
upon
every
topic
no
one
could
have
imagined
that
i
was
a
we
arrived
at
london
on
the
fifth
day
and
i
was
then
delivered
over
to
the
keeper
of
the
tower
according
to
the
instructions
that
my
conductors
had
received
they
bade
me
farewell
and
promised
that
they
would
not
fail
to
represent
my
conduct
to
the
authorities
and
gave
me
hopes
of
a
speedy
release
i
had
the
same
idea
and
took
possession
of
the
apartments
prepared
for
me
which
were
airy
and
well
ventilated
with
almost
cheerfulness
on
the
third
day
of
my
arrival
a
commission
was
sent
to
the
tower
to
examine
me
and
i
gave
the
same
replies
as
before
they
were
very
particular
in
obtaining
the
descriptions
of
the
persons
of
those
whom
i
had
landed
in
france
and
i
answered
without
disguise
i
afterwards
found
out
that
i
had
done
a
very
foolish
thing
had
i
misrepresented
their
persons
it
would
have
been
supposed
that
they
really
were
four
catholic
priests
but
from
my
exact
description
they
discovered
that
i
had
rescued
the
four
traitors
as
they
termed
them
that
they
were
the
most
anxious
to
secure
and
make
an
example
of
and
their
annoyance
at
this
discovery
had
so
angered
them
against
me
that
my
subsequent
conduct
could
not
create
any
feeling
favourable
towards
me
three
weeks
elapsed
and
i
was
wearied
of
confinement
my
gaoler
told
me
that
he
feared
my
case
was
a
bad
one
and
after
another
week
had
passed
he
said
that
i
was
condemned
as
aiding
and
abetting
treason
i
must
say
that
i
little
expected
this
result
and
it
quite
overthrew
me
i
asked
my
gaoler
what
was
his
authority
he
said
that
so
many
people
had
assisted
and
effected
the
escape
of
the
rebels
without
one
having
been
convicted
of
having
so
done
except
myself
on
my
own
avowal
that
they
deemed
it
absolutely
necessary
that
an
example
should
be
made
to
deter
others
from
aiding
those
who
were
still
secreted
in
the
country
and
that
in
consequence
it
had
been
decided
by
the
privy
council
that
i
should
be
made
an
example
of
he
told
me
much
more
which
i
need
not
repeat
except
that
it
proved
the
malignant
feeling
that
was
indulged
by
the
powers
in
authority
against
those
who
had
assisted
their
defeated
opponents
and
i
felt
that
i
had
no
chance
and
prepared
my
mind
to
meet
my
fate
alas
my
dear
madam
i
was
but
ill
prepared
to
die
not
that
i
feared
death
but
i
feared
what
must
be
my
condition
after
death
i
had
lived
a
reckless
lawless
life
without
fear
of
god
or
man
all
the
religious
feelings
which
had
been
instilled
into
me
by
my
good
tutor
you
know
my
family
history
and
i
need
say
no
more
during
my
youth
had
been
gradually
sapped
away
by
the
loose
companionship
which
i
had
held
since
the
time
that
i
quitted
my
father
house
and
when
i
heard
that
i
was
to
die
my
mind
was
in
a
state
of
great
disquiet
and
uncomfortable
feeling
i
wished
to
review
my
life
and
examine
myself
but
i
hardly
knew
where
to
begin
all
was
chaos
and
confusion
i
could
remember
many
bad
actions
but
few
good
ones
i
felt
that
i
was
like
a
vessel
without
a
rudder
and
without
a
pilot
and
after
hours
and
hours
of
deep
thought
i
would
give
up
the
task
of
examination
in
stern
despair
saying
to
myself
well
if
it
must
be
so
it
must
i
felt
an
inclination
to
defy
that
heaven
which
i
felt
would
never
be
opened
to
me
this
was
the
case
for
more
than
a
week
after
i
heard
of
my
condemnation
until
i
began
to
reflect
upon
the
nature
of
our
creed
and
the
terms
of
salvation
which
were
offered
and
as
i
thought
over
them
i
felt
a
dawn
of
hope
and
i
requested
the
gaoler
to
furnish
me
with
a
bible
i
read
it
day
and
night
for
i
expected
every
morning
to
be
summoned
to
execution
i
felt
almost
agony
at
times
lest
such
should
be
the
case
but
time
passed
on
and
another
fortnight
elapsed
during
which
i
had
profited
by
my
reading
and
felt
some
contrition
for
my
many
offences
and
my
life
of
guilt
and
i
also
felt
that
i
could
be
saved
through
the
merits
of
him
who
died
for
the
whole
world
day
after
day
my
faith
became
more
lively
and
my
mind
more
at
ease
one
morning
the
gaoler
came
to
me
and
said
that
there
was
a
priest
who
wished
to
see
me
as
i
understood
he
was
a
roman
i
was
about
to
refuse
but
on
consideration
i
thought
otherwise
and
he
was
admitted
he
was
a
tall
spare
man
with
a
dark
spanish
countenance
you
are
i
believe
said
he
captain
elrington
who
effected
the
escape
of
some
of
our
poor
friends
and
who
are
now
condemned
for
your
kind
act
i
am
sir
replied
i
i
am
aware
said
he
that
your
profession
of
faith
is
not
mine
and
do
not
therefore
come
to
talk
with
you
on
serious
points
without
you
should
wish
it
yourself
my
object
is
being
indebted
as
we
are
to
you
for
saving
our
friends
to
offer
to
be
of
any
use
that
i
can
to
you
in
executing
any
wishes
or
delivering
any
messages
which
you
may
wish
to
give
should
you
suffer
for
your
generous
conduct
and
you
may
trust
anything
to
me
with
safety
that
i
swear
to
you
and
he
took
a
crucifix
from
the
folds
of
his
garment
and
kissed
it
as
he
said
so
i
thank
you
for
your
kind
offer
sir
replied
i
but
i
have
nothing
to
trouble
you
with
i
have
long
quitted
my
family
who
know
not
whether
i
am
alive
or
dead
for
reasons
that
i
need
not
explain
i
am
under
an
assumed
name
and
it
is
my
intention
to
suffer
under
that
name
that
my
family
may
not
be
disgraced
by
my
ignominious
death
or
be
aware
that
i
have
perished
on
the
scaffold
perhaps
you
are
right
replied
the
priest
but
let
us
talk
upon
another
point
have
you
no
friends
that
could
exert
themselves
in
your
favour
so
as
to
procure
your
pardon
and
release
none
replied
i
except
those
who
i
am
sure
are
exerting
themselves
to
the
utmost
of
their
power
and
to
whom
no
message
from
me
is
necessary
do
you
know
nobody
at
court
said
the
priest
no
person
of
rank
in
the
government
or
i
may
say
opposed
to
the
government
for
people
are
not
what
they
seem
or
pretend
to
be
i
have
no
knowledge
of
any
titled
person
replied
i
when
i
parted
with
one
of
the
gentlemen
whom
i
landed
at
bordeaux
he
gave
me
the
name
of
a
lady
of
quality
at
paris
desiring
me
if
in
difficulty
to
apply
to
him
through
her
but
that
was
if
in
difficulty
in
france
of
course
she
could
do
nothing
for
me
in
this
country
have
you
the
name
of
the
lady
yes
replied
i
it
is
on
the
first
leaf
of
my
here
it
is
the
priest
read
the
name
and
then
said
you
must
write
immediately
a
few
words
acquainting
her
with
your
position
i
will
see
the
letter
safely
delivered
before
the
week
is
over
what
good
can
she
possibly
do
me
replied
i
i
can
not
say
but
this
i
know
that
if
anything
is
to
be
done
it
will
be
write
immediately
the
priest
called
the
gaoler
and
requested
writing
materials
which
were
brought
and
in
a
few
minutes
i
had
done
as
he
requested
there
sir
i
have
written
to
please
you
but
i
candidly
state
that
i
consider
it
a
useless
attempt
were
i
of
your
opinion
i
should
not
have
advised
you
to
write
replied
he
there
are
wheels
within
wheels
that
you
have
no
conception
of
in
these
troubled
times
what
i
most
fear
is
that
it
may
arrive
too
late
the
priest
took
his
leave
of
me
and
i
was
left
to
my
own
thoughts
when
i
considered
that
the
address
of
this
lady
had
been
given
to
me
by
the
very
man
whom
they
were
so
anxious
to
secure
as
a
traitor
i
at
once
decided
that
no
benefit
could
arrive
from
any
interference
on
her
part
and
i
therefore
after
a
quarter
of
an
hour
dismissed
the
whole
subject
from
my
thoughts
and
commenced
my
reading
of
the
sacred
writings
the
following
morning
when
the
gaoler
came
in
i
could
not
help
observing
to
him
that
as
i
had
been
condemned
so
many
days
i
felt
much
surprise
at
the
delay
of
my
execution
his
reply
was
that
he
heard
that
others
were
in
custody
upon
the
same
charge
and
that
they
waited
for
their
convictions
that
we
might
all
suffer
at
the
same
time
for
the
order
for
my
execution
had
come
on
the
friday
last
but
had
been
countermanded
on
the
afternoon
of
the
same
day
although
this
satisfied
me
that
i
had
no
hopes
of
escape
yet
i
was
pleased
that
i
had
obtained
more
time
for
preparation
and
i
renewed
my
reading
with
ardour
another
week
passed
when
the
gaoler
with
a
solemn
face
and
much
apparent
concern
came
in
and
informed
me
that
the
other
parties
arrested
had
been
tried
before
the
commission
and
had
been
condemned
and
that
it
was
expected
that
the
execution
would
take
place
either
on
the
morrow
or
the
day
after
the
announcement
did
not
affect
me
much
i
had
made
up
my
mind
that
i
should
suffer
and
had
to
a
degree
weaned
myself
from
life
i
considered
how
all
hopes
of
my
ever
enjoying
the
delight
of
my
family
and
kindred
ties
had
flown
away
and
i
looked
with
disgust
upon
my
career
as
a
privateersman
a
career
of
recklessness
and
blood
so
denounced
by
the
sacred
writings
which
i
had
before
me
i
reflected
that
if
i
were
to
leave
the
prison
i
should
have
no
other
means
of
sustenance
and
should
probably
return
to
my
former
life
and
load
my
soul
with
a
still
heavier
weight
of
crime
and
although
i
felt
an
occasional
bitter
pang
at
the
idea
of
leaving
the
world
so
young
a
world
which
i
could
not
hate
still
i
was
after
a
few
hours
communing
and
reflection
resigned
to
my
fate
and
exclaimed
with
sincerity
thy
will
be
done
i
think
madam
you
may
have
observed
that
sinful
as
i
was
my
whole
career
proved
that
i
was
not
a
hardened
sinner
good
was
not
driven
entirely
out
of
me
but
was
latent
notwithstanding
all
my
excesses
and
the
bad
company
which
had
influenced
me
i
now
prayed
and
prayed
earnestly
and
i
thought
that
my
prayers
were
heard
such
was
my
state
of
mind
on
the
day
before
the
one
appointed
for
my
execution
when
the
gaoler
and
one
of
the
sheriff
officers
came
into
my
cell
accompanied
by
the
roman
catholic
priest
whom
i
have
before
mentioned
i
perceived
by
the
countenance
of
the
gaoler
who
was
a
humane
man
that
he
had
no
unpleasant
news
the
sheriff
officer
delivered
to
him
an
order
for
my
liberation
and
to
my
astonishment
i
was
told
by
the
gaoler
that
my
pardon
was
signed
and
that
i
was
free
i
was
stupified
with
the
intelligence
and
i
stood
without
making
any
reply
the
priest
waved
his
hand
to
them
as
a
hint
to
leave
the
room
which
they
both
did
as
they
left
my
eyes
followed
them
and
then
i
cast
them
down
upon
the
bible
which
lay
before
me
on
the
table
and
slipping
down
from
the
bench
upon
my
knees
i
covered
up
my
face
and
prayed
my
prayers
were
confused
i
hardly
knew
what
i
said
but
i
knew
that
they
were
intended
to
be
grateful
to
heaven
for
my
unexpected
preservation
from
an
ignominious
death
after
a
time
i
rose
up
and
perceived
the
priest
whose
presence
i
had
till
then
forgotten
he
had
been
kneeling
at
the
other
side
of
the
table
praying
with
me
and
i
am
sure
for
me
and
he
was
rising
up
just
after
i
had
i
trust
captain
elrington
said
he
after
a
pause
that
the
peril
you
have
been
in
will
influence
your
future
life
and
that
this
severe
trial
will
not
be
thrown
away
upon
you
i
trust
not
sir
replied
i
i
feel
that
it
has
been
good
for
me
to
have
been
afflicted
i
believe
that
i
have
been
indebted
to
your
exertions
for
my
deliverance
no
further
than
having
seen
your
letter
duly
and
speedily
delivered
i
could
do
no
more
for
with
all
will
i
have
no
power
and
that
was
little
to
do
for
one
who
so
generously
assisted
our
friends
in
their
distress
am
i
then
to
believe
that
i
am
indebted
to
the
interest
of
a
french
lady
residing
at
the
court
of
versailles
for
my
deliverance
even
so
this
may
appear
strange
to
you
captain
elrington
but
such
is
the
case
understand
that
in
these
troubled
times
the
ruling
monarch
of
this
country
can
not
distinguish
his
friends
from
his
enemies
he
can
only
trust
to
professions
and
they
are
not
always
sincere
there
are
many
in
the
council
at
this
time
who
if
the
pretender
as
he
is
called
had
succeeded
would
long
before
this
have
joined
him
and
who
had
wished
him
success
although
they
dared
not
venture
to
assist
him
the
interest
of
the
lady
in
question
with
these
people
has
prevailed
over
the
true
adherents
of
the
hanoverian
king
and
thus
through
this
lady
have
you
obtained
your
release
i
state
this
to
you
in
confidence
to
publish
what
i
have
told
you
would
be
to
betray
your
friends
can
i
be
of
any
further
service
to
you
for
you
can
leave
your
prison
as
soon
as
you
please
none
i
thank
you
good
sir
replied
i
i
have
money
more
than
sufficient
to
reward
my
gaoler
and
to
defray
my
expenses
to
liverpool
you
have
my
best
thanks
and
sincere
wishes
for
your
happiness
then
i
will
not
intrude
upon
you
any
more
except
to
give
you
my
address
in
case
of
need
you
have
made
warm
friends
by
your
conduct
and
if
ever
you
require
their
assistance
it
will
not
be
withheld
the
priest
gave
his
address
upon
a
piece
of
paper
and
then
came
to
me
our
creeds
are
not
exactly
the
same
but
you
will
not
my
son
refuse
my
blessing
said
he
putting
his
hand
upon
my
head
oh
no
said
i
dropping
on
my
knees
i
receive
it
all
in
thankfulness
may
god
bless
you
my
son
said
he
with
emotion
and
he
then
quitted
the
cell
what
with
the
previous
excitement
when
my
liberation
was
announced
and
the
parting
with
the
kind
priest
my
feelings
were
so
powerful
that
as
soon
as
i
was
alone
i
gave
vent
to
them
in
a
flood
of
tears
as
soon
as
i
was
more
composed
i
rose
from
the
bench
put
my
necessaries
into
my
valise
and
summoned
the
gaoler
to
whom
i
made
a
handsome
present
thanking
him
for
his
kindness
during
my
incarceration
i
then
shook
hands
with
him
feed
the
turnkey
who
had
attended
upon
me
and
in
a
minute
more
i
was
clear
of
the
tower
gates
how
my
heart
heaved
when
i
was
once
more
in
the
open
air
i
looked
around
me
and
perceived
that
many
men
were
busy
in
erecting
a
scaffolding
my
heart
sank
as
i
beheld
them
as
i
felt
certain
what
it
was
for
but
to
verify
my
opinion
i
turned
to
an
old
woman
who
had
a
sort
of
stall
from
which
she
dispensed
mead
to
the
populace
and
inquired
of
her
for
what
the
scaffold
was
being
erected
it
for
the
men
who
are
to
be
executed
for
aiding
the
jacobites
to
escape
said
she
wo
your
worship
take
a
glass
of
mead
this
morning
i
am
not
thirsty
i
replied
as
i
walked
hastily
away
with
my
valise
upon
my
shoulders
a
stranger
to
this
part
of
london
i
hardly
knew
where
to
direct
my
steps
i
walked
past
the
square
before
the
tower
until
i
came
into
a
street
called
catherine
street
where
a
tavern
met
my
view
and
into
it
i
entered
immediately
glad
as
it
were
to
hide
myself
for
i
felt
as
if
all
the
world
looked
upon
me
as
a
person
just
discharged
from
prison
i
obtained
good
entertainment
there
and
slept
there
that
night
the
next
morning
the
host
having
provided
me
two
good
horses
and
a
youngster
to
take
them
back
i
set
off
for
liverpool
and
after
five
days
travel
without
adventure
i
arrived
at
the
town
and
proceeded
direct
to
the
house
of
mr
trevannion
my
owner
i
took
my
valise
off
the
boy
horse
and
having
paid
him
for
his
attendance
i
knocked
at
the
door
for
it
was
late
in
the
evening
and
dark
when
i
arrived
the
door
for
it
was
at
his
private
house
door
which
was
next
to
the
door
that
i
knocked
was
opened
and
the
woman
who
opened
it
shrieked
and
let
drop
the
candle
exclaiming
help
o
god
a
ghost
a
ghost
for
it
appeared
that
the
news
had
arrived
at
liverpool
from
a
messenger
who
had
been
sent
express
after
i
had
been
condemned
stating
that
there
was
no
hope
and
that
i
was
to
suffer
on
the
monday
previous
and
this
was
the
saturday
evening
on
which
i
had
arrived
mr
trevannion
clerk
hearing
a
noise
in
the
passage
came
out
with
another
candle
and
seeing
me
and
the
woman
lying
on
the
floor
in
a
swoon
stared
staggered
to
the
door
of
the
room
where
his
master
was
sitting
and
the
door
being
ajar
he
fell
back
with
great
force
into
the
room
dropping
under
the
table
between
mr
trevannion
and
captain
levee
who
was
sitting
with
him
smoking
as
was
very
often
their
wont
this
brought
out
captain
levee
with
one
of
the
who
upon
seeing
me
ran
to
me
and
embracing
me
warmly
cried
out
as
the
clerk
made
his
escape
here
is
elrington
alive
and
well
sir
at
this
announcement
mr
trevannion
came
out
and
threw
himself
into
my
arms
saying
i
thank
god
for
all
his
mercies
but
above
all
that
i
have
not
been
the
cause
of
your
death
my
dear
elrington
come
in
he
exclaimed
in
a
faltering
voice
and
as
soon
as
he
gained
his
seat
he
laid
his
head
down
and
sobbed
with
excitement
and
joy
i
followed
captain
levee
into
the
room
and
was
taking
a
chair
when
i
perceived
there
was
another
person
present
besides
captain
levee
and
mr
trevannion
which
was
the
daughter
of
the
latter
that
is
i
presumed
as
much
for
i
knew
that
he
was
a
widower
and
had
one
daughter
living
out
of
a
family
of
three
children
she
appeared
to
be
about
seventeen
years
of
age
and
had
just
come
from
a
protestant
convent
as
they
called
establishments
where
young
women
were
educated
at
chester
mr
trevannion
was
still
with
his
face
covered
and
not
yet
recovered
from
his
burst
of
feeling
when
this
young
gentlewoman
came
up
to
me
and
said
captain
elrington
you
have
behaved
nobly
to
my
father
accept
my
hand
and
my
friendship
i
was
so
dazzled
from
coming
out
of
the
dark
and
so
excited
from
what
had
just
passed
that
i
was
almost
bewildered
but
i
accepted
the
offered
hand
and
bowed
over
it
although
i
declare
that
at
the
time
i
could
not
distinguish
her
features
although
i
perceived
that
her
person
was
slight
and
elegant
as
she
retreated
to
her
seat
mr
trevannion
who
had
recovered
from
his
emotion
said
i
thought
that
at
this
moment
your
head
was
exhibited
over
the
gates
of
the
idea
as
captain
levee
will
tell
you
has
haunted
me
for
i
felt
and
should
always
have
felt
that
i
was
the
cause
of
your
death
god
bless
you
my
dear
sir
and
may
i
have
an
opportunity
of
showing
you
my
gratitude
and
regard
for
your
noble
conduct
towards
me
and
the
sacrifice
which
you
would
have
made
you
need
not
tell
me
for
i
know
too
well
that
you
took
all
the
onus
and
blame
of
the
affair
upon
your
own
shoulders
and
preferred
death
to
impeaching
me
my
dear
elrington
said
captain
levee
i
told
our
crew
and
you
have
proved
me
a
true
prophet
that
you
never
would
peach
but
die
game
we
were
talking
of
you
supposing
you
dead
when
you
came
in
i
must
tell
you
that
more
than
once
mr
trevannion
had
made
up
his
mind
to
deliver
himself
up
and
acknowledge
the
truth
but
i
prevented
him
as
it
would
have
been
a
useless
sacrifice
you
did
but
nevertheless
it
was
so
heavy
on
my
conscience
that
had
it
not
been
for
your
perseverance
and
the
thoughts
of
leaving
my
poor
girl
here
an
orphan
in
the
world
i
certainly
should
have
so
done
for
i
felt
life
to
be
a
burden
i
am
very
glad
that
you
did
not
sir
i
replied
my
life
is
of
little
value
i
have
no
one
to
support
no
one
to
love
and
no
one
to
lament
me
if
i
fall
a
shot
from
the
enemy
may
soon
send
me
out
of
the
world
and
there
will
only
be
a
man
the
less
in
it
as
far
as
people
are
interested
about
me
that
is
not
the
case
now
at
all
events
replied
mr
trevannion
but
pray
tell
us
how
it
is
that
you
have
escaped
i
have
not
escaped
i
replied
here
is
my
pardon
with
the
and
how
was
it
obtained
exclaimed
captain
levee
all
intercession
made
through
some
of
the
strongest
friends
of
the
government
was
in
vain
that
i
can
assert
for
you
must
not
suppose
that
we
have
been
idle
down
here
we
did
not
leave
london
till
after
you
were
condemned
and
every
entreaty
to
see
you
or
to
communicate
by
letter
was
denied
to
us
i
had
better
then
begin
at
the
beginning
and
state
all
that
occurred
i
will
first
thank
you
my
dear
levee
for
your
kind
assistance
which
i
would
not
avail
myself
of
as
i
calculated
wrongly
i
own
that
it
would
be
wiser
to
remain
a
prisoner
and
i
considered
that
my
very
refusal
to
escape
would
be
admitted
by
the
government
as
a
proof
of
my
innocence
i
did
not
know
that
i
had
to
deal
with
such
malignant
people
i
then
commenced
my
narrative
which
occupied
the
remainder
of
the
evening
and
having
received
their
congratulations
we
had
a
pipe
or
two
and
as
i
was
fatigued
we
retired
to
bed
i
slept
little
on
this
i
may
say
first
night
of
rest
and
quiet
after
my
liberation
i
was
happy
and
yet
perplexed
during
the
time
of
my
imprisonment
it
had
occurred
to
me
that
the
life
of
a
privateersman
was
not
one
which
i
could
follow
up
with
a
good
conscience
and
i
had
on
my
journey
down
to
liverpool
made
up
my
mind
that
i
would
give
it
up
i
knew
this
might
annoy
mr
trevannion
and
that
i
should
have
to
meet
with
the
ridicule
of
captain
levee
and
i
was
thinking
whether
it
were
possible
in
the
first
place
that
i
could
give
some
excuse
and
in
the
next
what
other
means
of
gaining
my
livelihood
i
could
substitute
in
its
stead
my
restlessness
induced
me
to
get
up
earlier
than
usual
and
i
went
out
for
an
hour
walk
upon
the
wharfs
i
saw
my
little
schooner
riding
on
the
stream
and
as
she
gently
rose
and
dipped
to
the
swell
which
ran
in
with
the
tide
she
looked
so
beautiful
that
my
resolutions
were
already
giving
way
i
would
look
at
her
no
longer
so
i
turned
from
the
river
and
walked
back
to
the
owner
house
it
was
still
early
when
i
went
into
the
where
i
found
miss
trevannion
alone
chapter
twelve
i
state
my
scruples
as
to
the
lawfulness
of
a
privateersman
life
to
trevannion
but
nevertheless
undertake
another
cruise
save
a
youth
from
drowning
who
he
proves
to
be
conflict
with
a
french
privateer
take
her
and
deliver
a
prize
return
to
liverpool
resign
the
command
of
the
and
agree
to
superintend
trevannion
business
miss
trevannion
my
dear
madam
was
taller
than
your
sex
usually
are
her
figure
slight
and
still
unformed
to
a
certain
degree
but
promising
perfection
her
hair
was
very
dark
her
features
regular
and
handsome
her
complexion
very
pale
and
her
skin
fair
as
the
snow
as
she
stood
in
silence
she
reminded
you
of
a
classical
antique
statue
and
hardly
appeared
to
breathe
through
her
delicate
lips
but
when
she
was
animated
with
conversation
it
almost
reminded
you
of
the
promethean
fire
which
poets
state
was
stolen
from
heaven
to
animate
a
piece
of
marble
then
the
colour
came
in
her
cheeks
intelligence
played
on
her
countenance
and
everything
which
at
first
sight
appeared
wanting
was
like
magic
found
to
light
up
her
face
her
smiles
were
the
sweetest
i
ever
beheld
and
one
of
those
smiles
she
bestowed
upon
me
as
i
entered
the
room
and
paid
her
my
obeisance
the
night
before
i
had
not
observed
her
much
i
was
too
busy
with
her
father
and
captain
levee
and
she
sat
remote
from
the
table
and
distant
from
the
light
and
she
never
spoke
but
when
she
took
my
hand
and
thanked
me
as
i
mentioned
before
i
thought
then
that
her
voice
was
like
a
silver
bell
but
made
no
other
remark
upon
her
we
had
however
exchanged
but
few
words
before
her
father
came
in
accompanied
by
captain
levee
and
we
sat
down
to
our
repast
of
chocolate
after
we
had
broken
our
fast
captain
levee
hastened
away
on
board
of
his
vessel
my
imprisonment
had
detained
him
from
sailing
and
mr
trevannion
was
anxious
that
he
should
be
off
as
soon
as
possible
to
make
up
for
lost
time
as
the
expenses
of
the
vessel
were
heavy
farewell
elrington
for
the
present
said
he
i
shall
come
to
you
on
board
of
your
schooner
some
time
during
the
day
when
captain
levee
was
gone
for
to
tell
the
truth
i
was
afraid
of
his
ridicule
i
thought
it
a
good
opportunity
to
give
my
thoughts
to
my
owner
and
as
i
had
nothing
to
say
which
his
daughter
might
not
hear
i
began
as
follows
mr
trevannion
i
think
it
right
to
state
to
you
that
during
my
imprisonment
a
great
change
has
come
over
my
feelings
upon
certain
points
i
am
not
ashamed
to
acknowledge
that
it
has
been
occasioned
by
the
death
which
stared
me
in
the
face
and
from
my
having
seriously
communed
with
myself
and
examined
more
than
i
perhaps
have
done
during
the
whole
of
my
former
life
the
sacred
writings
which
are
given
us
as
our
guide
the
point
to
which
i
refer
is
that
i
have
come
to
a
conviction
that
privateering
is
not
a
lawful
or
honourable
profession
and
with
these
feelings
i
should
wish
to
resign
the
command
of
the
schooner
which
you
have
had
the
kindness
to
give
me
indeed
elrington
replied
mr
trevannion
well
i
should
not
have
thought
to
have
heard
this
from
you
i
confess
much
as
i
respect
your
scruples
you
are
too
scrupulous
i
can
hardly
imagine
that
you
have
turned
to
the
sect
of
the
quakers
and
think
fighting
is
contrary
to
the
scriptures
no
sir
not
so
far
as
that
i
consider
war
as
a
profession
both
necessary
and
honourable
and
a
nation
is
bound
to
be
prepared
for
any
foreign
attack
and
to
act
upon
the
defensive
or
on
the
offensive
if
it
is
necessary
it
is
not
that
i
do
not
consider
the
soldier
who
fights
for
his
country
is
not
doing
his
duty
nor
the
seamen
who
are
employed
by
the
state
are
not
equally
justified
in
their
profession
what
i
refer
to
is
privateering
that
is
vessels
fitted
out
for
the
purpose
of
aggression
by
private
merchants
and
merely
for
the
sake
of
profit
they
are
not
fitted
out
with
any
patriotic
motives
but
merely
for
gain
they
are
speculations
in
which
the
lives
of
people
on
both
sides
are
sacrificed
for
the
sake
of
lucre
and
had
you
witnessed
such
scenes
of
bloodshed
and
cruelty
as
i
have
during
my
career
such
dreadful
passions
let
loose
and
defying
all
restraint
you
would
agree
with
me
that
he
who
leads
such
miscreants
to
their
quarry
has
much
to
answer
for
were
it
possible
to
control
the
men
on
board
of
a
privateer
as
the
men
are
controlled
in
the
king
service
it
might
be
more
excusable
but
manned
as
privateers
always
will
be
with
the
most
reckless
characters
when
once
they
are
roused
by
opposition
stimulated
by
the
sight
of
plunder
or
drunken
with
victory
no
power
on
earth
can
restrain
their
barbarity
and
vengeance
and
a
captain
of
a
privateer
who
attempted
would
in
most
cases
if
he
stood
between
them
and
their
will
unless
he
were
supported
fall
a
victim
to
his
rashness
all
this
i
have
seen
and
all
i
now
express
i
have
long
felt
even
when
younger
and
more
thoughtless
you
know
that
i
did
give
up
privateering
at
one
time
because
i
was
shocked
at
the
excesses
to
which
i
was
a
party
since
that
i
have
accepted
the
command
of
a
vessel
for
the
idea
of
being
captain
was
too
flattering
to
my
vanity
to
permit
me
to
refuse
but
reflection
has
again
decided
me
not
to
engage
in
it
further
i
hope
this
communication
will
not
displease
you
mr
trevannion
if
i
am
wrong
in
my
opinion
at
all
events
i
am
sincere
for
i
am
giving
up
my
only
source
of
livelihood
from
a
sense
of
duty
i
know
that
you
are
sincere
elrington
replied
mr
trevannion
but
at
the
same
time
i
think
that
you
are
much
too
in
your
opinions
when
nations
are
at
war
they
mutually
do
all
the
mischief
that
they
can
to
each
other
and
i
can
not
see
what
difference
there
is
between
my
fitting
out
a
privateer
under
the
king
authority
or
the
king
having
vessels
and
men
for
the
national
service
the
government
fit
out
all
the
vessels
that
they
can
and
when
their
own
funds
are
exhausted
they
encourage
individuals
to
employ
their
capital
in
adding
to
the
means
of
distressing
the
enemy
if
i
had
property
on
the
high
seas
would
it
be
respected
any
more
than
other
english
property
by
the
enemy
certainly
not
and
therefore
i
am
not
bound
to
respect
theirs
the
end
of
war
is
to
obtain
an
honourable
peace
and
the
more
the
enemy
is
distressed
the
sooner
are
you
likely
to
obtain
one
i
do
not
therefore
consider
that
privateering
is
worse
than
any
other
species
of
warfare
or
that
the
privateersman
is
a
whit
more
reckless
or
brutal
than
soldiers
or
men
in
the
hour
of
victory
in
the
service
there
is
this
difference
sir
replied
i
first
in
the
officers
commanding
although
glad
to
obtain
they
are
stimulated
by
nobler
feelings
as
well
they
look
to
honour
and
distinction
they
have
the
feeling
that
they
are
defending
their
king
and
country
to
support
them
and
throw
a
halo
on
their
exertions
and
they
have
such
control
over
their
men
that
although
i
admit
they
are
equally
inclined
to
excess
as
the
privateersman
they
are
held
in
check
by
the
authority
which
they
dare
not
resist
now
mr
trevannion
privateersmen
seek
not
honour
and
are
not
stimulated
by
a
desire
to
serve
the
country
all
they
look
to
is
how
to
obtain
the
property
of
others
under
sanction
and
could
they
without
any
risk
do
so
they
would
care
little
whether
it
was
english
property
or
not
provided
that
they
put
the
money
into
their
pockets
if
i
held
this
opinion
as
a
seaman
on
board
of
a
privateer
what
must
i
feel
now
when
i
am
the
leader
of
such
people
and
the
responsibility
of
their
acts
is
thrown
upon
my
shoulders
for
such
i
feel
is
the
case
i
think
replied
mr
trevannion
that
we
had
better
not
discuss
this
question
any
further
just
now
of
course
you
must
decide
for
yourself
but
i
have
this
favour
to
ask
of
you
trusting
to
your
resuming
the
command
of
the
vessel
i
have
no
one
to
replace
you
at
present
and
i
hope
you
will
not
refuse
to
take
the
command
of
her
for
one
more
cruise
should
you
on
your
return
and
on
mature
reflection
be
of
the
same
opinion
as
you
are
now
i
certainly
shall
no
longer
press
you
to
remain
and
will
do
all
i
can
to
assist
you
in
any
other
views
you
may
have
to
that
sir
i
can
have
no
objection
replied
i
it
would
be
unfair
of
me
to
leave
you
without
a
captain
to
the
vessel
and
i
am
therefore
ready
to
sail
in
her
as
soon
as
you
please
upon
the
understanding
that
i
may
quit
her
if
i
am
of
the
same
opinion
as
i
am
now
upon
my
return
to
port
i
thank
you
my
dear
sir
said
mr
trevannion
rising
that
is
all
i
request
i
must
now
go
to
the
so
saying
he
left
the
room
but
his
countenance
showed
that
he
was
far
from
pleased
miss
trevannion
who
had
been
a
silent
listener
to
the
conversation
as
soon
as
her
father
had
closed
the
door
after
him
thus
spoke
captain
elrington
the
opinion
of
a
young
maiden
like
me
can
be
of
little
value
but
you
know
not
how
much
pleasure
you
have
given
me
by
the
sentiments
you
have
expressed
alas
that
a
man
so
good
so
generous
and
so
feeling
in
every
other
respect
should
be
led
away
by
the
desire
of
gain
to
be
the
owner
of
such
a
description
of
property
but
in
this
town
wealth
is
everything
the
way
by
which
it
is
obtained
is
not
thought
of
my
father
father
left
him
a
large
property
in
vessels
employed
wholly
in
the
and
it
was
through
the
persuasions
of
my
poor
mother
that
my
father
was
induced
to
give
up
that
nefarious
traffic
since
that
his
capital
has
been
chiefly
employed
in
privateering
which
if
not
so
brutal
and
disgraceful
is
certainly
nearly
as
demoralising
i
have
been
home
but
a
short
time
and
i
have
already
ventured
to
express
my
opinion
certainly
not
so
forcibly
and
so
well
as
you
have
upon
the
subject
but
i
was
laughed
at
as
a
girl
who
could
not
be
a
fit
judge
of
such
matters
but
now
that
you
a
captain
of
one
of
his
vessels
have
expressed
your
dislike
to
the
profession
i
think
some
good
may
arise
if
my
father
were
a
poor
man
it
would
be
more
excusable
if
excuse
there
can
be
but
such
is
not
the
case
he
is
wealthy
and
to
whom
has
he
to
leave
his
wealth
but
to
me
his
only
child
captain
elrington
you
are
right
be
firm
my
father
obligations
to
you
are
very
great
and
your
opinion
will
have
its
influence
i
am
his
daughter
his
only
daughter
his
love
for
me
is
great
i
know
and
i
also
have
my
power
over
him
supported
as
i
have
been
by
you
i
will
now
exert
it
to
the
utmost
to
persuade
him
to
retire
from
further
employment
of
his
means
in
such
a
speculation
i
thanked
you
yesterday
when
i
first
saw
you
for
your
noble
behaviour
i
little
thought
that
i
should
have
again
in
so
short
a
time
to
express
my
thanks
miss
trevannion
did
not
wait
for
any
reply
from
me
but
then
quitted
the
room
i
must
say
that
although
so
young
a
person
i
was
much
pleased
at
miss
trevannion
approval
of
my
sentiments
she
appeared
from
the
very
short
acquaintance
i
had
had
with
her
to
be
a
person
of
a
firm
and
decided
disposition
and
very
different
from
the
insipid
class
of
females
generally
met
with
her
approval
strengthened
my
resolution
still
as
i
had
promised
her
father
that
i
would
go
another
cruise
in
the
privateer
i
left
the
house
and
went
on
board
to
resume
the
command
my
return
was
joyfully
hailed
by
the
officers
and
men
which
is
not
always
the
case
i
found
her
as
may
be
supposed
ready
for
sea
at
a
minute
warning
so
that
i
had
nothing
to
do
but
embark
my
effects
which
i
did
before
the
noon
was
passed
and
then
went
on
shore
to
mr
trevannion
to
receive
his
orders
i
found
him
with
captain
levee
in
the
back
room
and
i
told
mr
trevannion
that
i
had
resumed
the
command
and
was
ready
to
sail
as
soon
as
he
pleased
we
must
make
up
for
lost
time
elrington
replied
he
i
have
ordered
captain
levee
to
cruise
to
the
northward
of
the
western
isles
occasionally
working
up
as
far
as
the
scilly
isles
now
i
think
you
had
better
take
your
ground
in
the
channel
between
dunkirk
and
calais
there
is
as
much
to
be
made
by
salvage
in
recapturing
english
vessels
in
that
quarter
as
there
is
in
taking
the
enemy
vessels
and
i
am
sure
added
mr
trevannion
smiling
you
will
think
that
legitimate
warfare
at
this
captain
levee
laughed
and
said
i
have
been
told
what
you
said
to
mr
trevannion
elrington
i
said
that
it
was
the
effects
of
being
condemned
for
high
treason
and
would
wear
off
in
a
cruise
good
impressions
do
wear
off
very
soon
i
fear
replied
i
but
i
hope
that
it
will
not
be
the
case
in
this
instance
we
shall
see
my
good
fellow
replied
captain
levee
for
my
part
i
hope
they
will
for
otherwise
we
shall
lose
the
best
privateersman
i
ever
fell
in
with
however
it
no
use
bringing
up
the
question
now
let
us
wait
till
our
cruises
are
over
and
we
meet
again
good
bye
elrington
and
may
you
be
fortunate
my
anchor
is
short
stay
apeak
and
i
shall
be
under
sail
in
half
an
hour
captain
levee
sailed
at
the
time
that
he
mentioned
i
remained
at
anchor
till
the
next
morning
and
then
once
more
was
running
down
the
irish
channel
before
a
stiff
breeze
i
forgot
to
mention
that
while
at
mr
trevannion
i
had
looked
at
the
address
of
the
catholic
priest
who
had
announced
to
me
my
release
from
prison
and
had
left
copies
of
it
as
well
as
of
that
of
the
lady
at
paris
in
the
care
of
mr
trevannion
it
was
now
cold
autumnal
weather
and
the
channel
was
but
rough
during
the
first
fortnight
we
were
fortunate
enough
to
make
two
recaptures
of
considerable
value
which
arrived
safely
in
the
thames
after
which
we
had
a
succession
of
gales
from
the
southward
it
being
the
time
of
the
equinox
which
drove
us
close
to
the
sands
of
yarmouth
and
we
even
had
difficulty
in
clearing
them
and
getting
into
by
standing
to
the
eastward
the
weather
still
continued
very
bad
and
we
were
under
storm
sails
for
several
days
and
at
last
found
ourselves
a
degree
and
a
half
to
the
northward
off
the
coast
of
norfolk
when
the
weather
moderated
and
the
wind
changed
to
the
northward
it
was
a
fine
clear
night
but
with
no
moon
and
we
were
running
before
the
wind
to
regain
our
but
the
wind
again
shifted
and
baffled
us
and
at
last
it
fell
light
and
being
on
a
wind
we
did
not
make
more
than
four
miles
an
hour
although
there
was
very
little
sea
about
one
in
the
morning
i
had
gone
on
deck
and
was
walking
to
and
fro
with
the
first
officer
mr
james
when
i
thought
that
i
heard
a
faint
halloo
from
to
windward
stop
said
i
silence
there
forward
i
listened
and
thought
that
i
heard
the
cry
again
mr
james
said
i
did
you
not
hear
some
one
shout
no
sir
replied
he
wait
then
and
listen
we
did
so
but
i
could
not
hear
it
repeated
i
am
certain
that
i
heard
a
voice
as
if
on
the
waters
said
i
perhaps
some
one
has
fallen
overboard
turn
the
hands
up
to
muster
and
haul
the
to
windward
the
men
were
mustered
but
no
one
was
missing
it
was
your
fancy
sir
observed
the
first
officer
it
may
have
been
replied
i
but
i
am
still
in
my
own
mind
persuaded
that
such
was
the
case
perhaps
i
was
mistaken
shall
we
let
draw
the
sir
said
mr
james
yes
we
may
as
well
but
the
wind
is
lighter
than
it
was
i
think
we
shall
have
a
calm
it
will
be
as
much
as
she
can
do
to
stem
the
tide
and
hold
her
own
observed
mr
james
let
draw
the
my
lads
somehow
or
another
i
had
a
feeling
which
i
could
not
surmount
that
i
certainly
had
heard
a
faint
shout
and
although
admitting
such
to
be
the
case
there
was
little
chance
of
being
of
service
to
any
one
i
felt
a
reluctance
to
leave
the
spot
and
as
i
walked
the
deck
silent
and
alone
this
feeling
became
insurmountable
i
remained
on
deck
till
the
tide
turned
and
then
instead
of
taking
advantage
of
it
so
as
to
gain
to
the
southward
i
put
the
head
the
other
way
so
as
to
keep
as
near
as
i
could
to
the
spot
where
i
heard
the
voice
reducing
her
sail
so
as
just
to
stem
the
tide
i
can
not
now
account
for
my
anxiety
which
under
the
circumstances
i
most
certainly
never
should
have
felt
unless
it
was
that
providence
was
pleased
to
interpose
on
this
occasion
more
directly
than
usual
i
could
not
leave
the
deck
i
waited
for
daylight
with
great
impatience
and
as
the
day
dawned
i
had
my
telescope
in
my
hand
looking
round
the
compass
at
last
as
the
sun
rose
from
the
fog
on
the
horizon
something
attracted
my
eye
and
i
made
it
out
to
be
the
two
masts
of
a
vessel
which
had
sunk
in
about
six
fathoms
of
water
still
i
could
see
nothing
except
the
masts
however
to
make
sure
i
made
sail
on
the
schooner
and
stood
towards
them
a
short
tack
enabled
us
to
fetch
and
in
half
an
hour
we
passed
the
wreck
about
a
to
windward
when
we
perceived
an
arm
lifted
up
out
of
the
water
and
waved
to
us
there
is
somebody
there
said
i
and
i
was
right
quickly
my
lads
to
windward
and
lower
down
the
this
was
done
in
a
minute
and
in
a
short
time
the
boat
returned
bringing
with
them
a
lad
about
sixteen
years
old
whom
they
had
found
in
the
water
clinging
to
the
masts
of
the
vessel
he
was
too
much
exhausted
to
speak
or
move
he
was
put
into
bed
covered
up
with
blankets
and
some
warm
spirits
and
water
poured
down
his
throat
we
then
hoisted
up
the
boat
and
made
sail
upon
the
schooner
and
i
went
down
below
to
breakfast
rejoicing
that
i
had
acted
upon
the
impulse
which
i
had
felt
and
had
thus
been
instrumental
in
saving
the
life
of
a
a
few
minutes
after
he
was
put
into
bed
the
lad
fell
into
a
sound
sleep
which
continued
during
the
whole
of
the
day
the
next
morning
he
awoke
greatly
recovered
and
very
hungry
and
as
soon
as
he
had
eaten
he
rose
and
dressed
himself
i
then
sent
for
him
as
i
was
impatient
to
see
him
and
learn
his
history
when
he
entered
the
cabin
it
struck
me
i
had
seen
his
features
before
but
where
i
could
not
say
to
my
inquiries
he
stated
that
the
brig
was
the
jane
and
mary
of
hull
laden
with
coals
that
they
had
started
a
wooden
end
during
the
gale
and
that
she
had
filled
so
rapidly
that
they
got
the
boat
from
off
the
boom
to
save
their
lives
but
from
the
heavy
sea
running
and
the
confusion
the
boat
had
been
bilged
against
the
bulwarks
and
went
down
as
they
were
shoving
off
that
he
had
supported
himself
by
one
of
the
oars
and
was
soon
separated
from
his
companions
who
floated
around
him
that
during
this
time
the
brig
had
sunk
and
he
clinging
to
the
oar
had
been
drawn
towards
her
as
she
sank
and
carried
some
feet
under
water
on
his
rising
he
perceived
the
masts
above
water
and
had
made
for
them
and
on
looking
round
he
could
not
see
any
of
the
rest
of
the
crew
who
must
have
all
perished
that
he
had
been
two
days
on
the
mast
and
was
perished
with
cold
finding
that
his
feet
which
hung
down
on
the
water
were
much
warmer
than
the
other
portions
of
his
body
exposed
to
the
wind
he
had
sunk
himself
down
in
the
water
and
remained
there
and
had
he
not
done
so
he
must
have
perished
i
asked
him
how
long
he
had
been
at
sea
and
he
said
he
had
only
gone
one
voyage
and
had
been
but
three
months
on
board
there
was
something
in
his
manner
so
superior
to
the
condition
of
apprentice
which
he
stated
himself
to
be
on
board
of
such
a
vessel
and
i
felt
such
an
interest
which
i
could
not
account
for
towards
the
lad
that
i
then
asked
who
were
his
friends
he
replied
stammering
that
he
had
not
a
friend
in
the
world
except
a
brother
older
than
himself
by
many
years
and
he
did
not
know
where
he
was
but
your
father
name
is
he
alive
and
who
is
he
you
must
tell
me
that
or
i
shall
not
know
where
to
send
you
the
youth
was
very
confused
and
would
not
give
me
any
answer
come
my
lad
i
said
i
think
as
i
have
saved
your
life
i
deserve
a
little
confidence
and
it
shall
not
be
misplaced
i
perceive
that
you
have
not
been
brought
up
as
a
lad
for
the
sea
and
you
must
therefore
trust
me
i
will
sir
he
replied
if
you
will
not
send
me
back
to
my
father
and
mother
certainly
not
against
your
will
my
good
lad
i
replied
although
i
shall
probably
persuade
you
all
i
can
to
return
to
them
i
presume
you
ran
away
from
your
home
yes
sir
i
did
replied
he
for
i
could
not
possibly
stay
there
any
longer
and
my
brother
did
so
before
me
for
the
same
reason
that
i
did
well
i
promise
you
if
you
will
confide
in
me
that
i
will
not
force
your
inclinations
so
now
tell
me
who
are
your
father
and
mother
and
why
you
left
home
you
want
a
friend
now
and
without
confidence
you
can
not
expect
friendship
i
will
tell
you
all
sir
he
replied
for
i
see
by
your
face
that
you
will
not
take
advantage
of
me
he
then
commenced
and
you
may
imagine
my
surprise
my
dear
madam
when
i
found
that
it
was
my
own
brother
philip
whom
i
had
left
a
child
of
ten
years
old
who
was
addressing
me
he
had
as
he
had
asserted
left
his
home
and
thrown
himself
on
the
wide
world
for
the
same
reason
which
i
had
for
his
spirit
like
mine
could
not
brook
the
treatment
which
he
received
i
allowed
him
to
finish
his
narrative
and
then
made
myself
known
to
him
you
may
imagine
the
scene
and
the
delight
of
the
poor
fellow
who
as
he
encircled
me
in
his
arms
clinging
to
me
with
the
tears
of
joy
on
his
cheeks
told
me
that
his
great
object
had
been
to
find
me
out
and
that
although
he
had
no
idea
what
had
become
of
me
he
thought
it
most
likely
that
i
had
taken
to
a
seafaring
life
i
now
felt
certain
that
providence
had
specially
interposed
in
this
business
and
had
for
its
own
good
reasons
created
those
unusual
feelings
of
interest
which
i
described
to
you
that
i
might
be
the
saviour
of
my
brother
and
most
grateful
was
i
i
can
assure
you
i
had
now
a
companion
and
friend
one
to
love
and
to
cherish
i
was
no
longer
alone
in
the
world
and
i
do
not
know
when
i
had
felt
so
happy
for
a
long
while
i
left
my
brother
below
in
the
cabin
and
went
on
deck
to
acquaint
the
officers
with
this
strange
meeting
the
intelligence
soon
ran
through
the
vessel
and
of
course
the
poor
shipwrecked
boy
became
an
object
of
unusual
interest
that
whole
day
i
was
interrogating
and
receiving
intelligence
from
him
relative
to
our
family
i
made
him
describe
his
sisters
and
every
member
of
it
even
the
servants
and
our
neighbours
were
not
forgotten
and
for
the
first
time
since
i
had
quitted
home
i
knew
what
had
occurred
during
the
six
years
of
my
absence
from
the
accounts
he
gave
me
i
certainly
had
no
inclination
ever
to
return
as
long
as
certain
parties
were
in
existence
and
my
brother
declared
that
nothing
but
force
should
ever
induce
him
the
more
i
talked
with
him
the
more
i
was
pleased
with
him
he
appeared
of
a
frank
noble
disposition
full
of
honour
and
high
sentiments
winning
in
his
manners
and
mirthful
to
excess
indeed
his
handsome
countenance
implied
and
expressed
as
much
and
it
did
not
deceive
i
hardly
need
say
that
he
took
up
his
quarters
in
my
cabin
and
having
procured
for
him
more
suitable
apparel
he
looked
what
he
was
the
perfect
young
gentleman
he
was
soon
a
general
favourite
on
board
not
only
with
the
officers
but
with
the
men
one
would
have
thought
that
the
danger
and
distress
we
had
found
him
in
would
have
sickened
him
for
the
sea
for
ever
but
it
was
quite
the
contrary
he
delighted
in
his
profession
and
was
certainly
born
to
be
a
sailor
i
asked
him
what
he
felt
when
he
had
remained
so
long
clinging
to
the
mast
if
he
had
not
given
up
all
hopes
of
being
saved
and
he
replied
no
that
he
had
not
that
he
did
not
know
how
long
he
might
have
had
to
remain
there
but
that
he
had
never
abandoned
the
idea
of
being
taken
off
by
some
vessel
or
another
and
that
he
thought
that
he
might
have
continued
there
for
hours
longer
without
being
exhausted
as
after
he
had
sunk
himself
into
the
water
he
felt
warm
and
no
exertion
was
necessary
it
is
of
such
buoyant
spirits
as
these
madam
that
seamen
should
be
made
you
can
not
have
an
idea
of
the
pleasure
which
i
experienced
at
this
falling
in
with
my
brother
philip
it
appeared
to
have
given
a
new
stimulus
to
my
existence
even
privateering
did
not
appear
so
hateful
to
me
after
i
had
heard
him
express
his
delight
at
being
likely
to
be
so
employed
for
such
he
stated
had
long
been
his
ardent
wish
two
days
afterwards
we
had
regained
our
and
perceived
a
french
privateer
steering
for
the
port
of
calais
in
company
with
a
large
merchant
vessel
which
she
had
captured
the
wind
was
light
and
we
discovered
her
at
daybreak
just
as
the
fog
cleared
away
she
being
then
about
and
not
more
than
five
miles
distant
we
made
all
sail
and
soon
were
within
the
frenchman
appeared
determined
not
to
part
with
his
prize
without
a
trial
of
strength
but
as
the
captured
vessel
was
the
nearest
to
us
i
decided
to
retake
her
first
and
then
fight
him
if
he
wished
i
therefore
steered
to
lay
the
prize
by
the
board
the
frenchman
a
lugger
of
twelve
guns
perceiving
our
intention
made
also
for
the
prize
to
defend
her
he
steering
up
for
her
we
running
down
to
her
free
the
prize
lying
between
us
and
sheltering
each
of
us
from
the
other
guns
it
is
difficult
to
say
whether
the
frenchman
or
we
were
the
first
to
touch
her
sides
with
our
respective
vessels
i
rather
think
that
the
frenchman
was
a
second
or
two
before
us
at
all
events
they
were
quicker
than
we
were
and
were
on
the
deck
first
besides
having
the
advantage
of
the
assistance
of
their
men
already
on
board
so
that
we
were
taken
at
a
great
disadvantage
however
we
did
gain
the
deck
by
boarding
at
two
points
forward
and
aft
and
a
fierce
contest
ensued
the
french
were
more
numerous
than
we
were
but
my
men
were
better
selected
being
all
very
powerful
athletic
fellows
philip
had
boarded
with
the
other
party
forward
which
was
led
by
my
chief
officer
my
party
who
were
abaft
not
being
so
numerous
were
beaten
back
to
the
taffrail
of
the
vessel
where
we
stood
at
bay
defending
ourselves
against
the
furious
assaults
of
the
frenchmen
but
if
we
lost
the
other
party
gained
for
the
whole
body
of
the
frenchmen
were
between
us
and
them
and
those
who
faced
philip
party
were
driven
back
to
abaft
the
mainmast
it
so
happened
that
philip
was
thrown
down
on
the
deck
and
his
men
passed
over
him
and
while
in
that
position
and
unable
to
rise
from
the
pressure
upon
him
he
heard
a
calling
out
from
below
this
told
him
that
the
english
prisoners
were
in
the
hold
and
as
soon
as
he
could
rise
he
threw
off
the
hatches
and
they
rushed
up
to
the
number
of
stout
fellows
to
our
support
cheering
most
manfully
and
by
their
cheers
announcing
to
the
french
that
we
had
received
assistance
this
gave
fresh
courage
to
my
men
who
were
hard
pressed
and
faint
with
their
great
exertion
we
cheered
and
rushed
upon
the
enemy
who
were
already
weakened
by
many
of
them
having
turned
round
to
resist
the
increased
impetus
from
forward
our
cheers
were
replied
to
by
philip
party
and
the
prisoners
and
the
french
were
losing
the
day
they
made
another
desperate
rush
upon
philip
men
and
succeeded
in
driving
them
back
to
before
the
but
what
they
gained
forward
they
lost
abaft
as
we
pushed
on
with
vigour
this
was
their
last
attempt
the
being
open
several
of
them
in
the
confusion
fell
into
it
others
followed
them
of
their
own
accord
and
at
last
every
one
of
them
was
beaten
down
from
the
deck
and
the
hatches
were
put
over
them
with
three
cheers
now
for
the
privateer
she
is
our
own
cried
philip
follow
me
my
men
continued
he
as
he
sprang
upon
the
bulwarks
of
the
prize
and
from
thence
into
the
main
rigging
of
the
lugger
alongside
most
of
my
men
followed
him
and
as
there
were
but
few
men
left
on
board
of
the
lugger
she
was
soon
in
our
possession
and
thus
we
had
both
the
enemy
and
the
prize
without
firing
a
it
was
strange
that
this
combat
between
two
privateers
should
thus
be
decided
upon
the
deck
of
another
vessel
but
such
was
the
fact
we
had
several
men
badly
wounded
but
not
one
killed
the
french
were
not
quite
so
fortunate
as
seven
of
their
men
lay
dead
upon
the
decks
the
prize
proved
to
be
the
antelope
laden
with
sugar
and
rum
and
of
considerable
value
we
gave
her
up
to
the
captain
and
crew
who
had
at
afforded
us
such
timely
assistance
and
they
were
not
a
little
pleased
at
being
thus
rescued
from
a
french
prison
the
privateer
was
named
the
jean
bart
of
twelve
guns
and
one
hundred
and
fifteen
men
some
away
in
prizes
she
was
a
new
vessel
and
this
her
first
cruise
as
it
required
many
men
to
man
her
and
we
had
the
prisoners
to
encumber
us
i
resolved
that
i
would
take
her
to
liverpool
at
once
and
six
days
afterwards
we
arrived
there
without
further
adventure
philip
gallant
conduct
had
won
him
great
favour
with
my
officers
and
men
and
i
must
say
that
i
felt
very
proud
of
him
as
soon
as
we
had
anchored
both
vessels
i
went
on
shore
with
philip
to
mr
trevannion
to
give
him
an
account
of
what
had
occurred
during
the
short
cruise
and
i
hardly
need
say
that
he
was
satisfied
with
the
results
as
we
had
made
three
recaptures
of
value
besides
a
privateer
i
introduced
philip
to
him
acquainting
him
with
his
miraculous
preservation
and
mr
trevannion
very
kindly
invited
him
for
the
present
to
remain
in
his
house
we
then
took
our
leave
promising
to
be
back
by
and
i
went
with
philip
to
fit
him
out
in
a
more
creditable
way
and
having
made
my
purchases
and
given
my
orders
it
being
then
almost
two
we
hastened
to
mr
trevannion
that
we
might
be
in
time
for
dinner
i
was
i
must
confess
anxious
to
see
miss
trevannion
for
she
had
often
occupied
my
thoughts
during
the
cruise
she
met
me
with
great
friendliness
and
welcomed
me
back
our
dinner
was
very
agreeable
and
philip
sallies
were
much
approved
of
he
was
indeed
a
mirthful
witty
lad
full
of
jest
and
humour
and
with
a
good
presence
withal
mr
trevannion
being
called
out
just
as
dinner
was
finished
miss
trevannion
observed
i
presume
mr
elrington
that
your
good
fortune
and
the
reputation
you
have
acquired
in
so
short
a
time
have
put
an
end
to
all
your
misgivings
as
to
a
life
i
am
not
quite
so
light
and
inconstant
miss
trevannion
replied
i
i
rejoice
that
in
this
cruise
i
have
really
nothing
to
lament
or
blush
for
and
trust
at
the
same
time
we
have
been
serviceable
to
our
country
but
my
opinion
is
the
same
and
i
certainly
wish
that
i
had
fought
under
the
king
pennant
instead
of
on
board
of
a
privateer
you
are
then
of
the
same
mind
and
intend
to
resign
the
command
i
do
miss
trevannion
although
i
admit
that
this
lad
welfare
makes
it
more
important
than
ever
that
i
should
have
some
means
of
livelihood
i
rejoice
to
hear
you
speak
thus
mr
elrington
and
i
think
my
father
obligations
to
you
are
such
that
if
he
does
not
assist
you
i
should
feel
ashamed
of
him
but
such
i
am
certain
will
not
be
the
case
he
will
forward
your
views
whatever
they
may
be
to
the
utmost
of
his
power
at
the
same
time
i
admit
from
conversations
i
have
had
with
him
that
he
will
be
mortified
at
your
resigning
the
command
and
so
shall
i
said
philip
for
i
do
not
agree
with
you
or
my
brother
i
see
no
more
harm
in
privateering
than
in
any
other
fighting
i
suppose
miss
trevannion
you
have
been
the
cause
of
my
scruples
and
i
tell
you
candidly
to
your
face
that
i
do
not
thank
you
for
it
miss
trevannion
coloured
up
at
this
remark
and
then
replied
i
do
not
think
mr
philip
that
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
your
brother
more
than
three
times
in
my
life
and
that
within
this
last
six
weeks
and
sure
i
am
that
we
have
not
had
a
quarter
of
an
hour
conversation
altogether
it
is
therefore
assuredly
too
much
to
say
that
i
am
the
cause
and
your
brother
will
tell
you
that
he
expressed
these
opinions
before
i
ever
had
had
any
conversation
with
him
that
may
be
replied
philip
but
you
approved
of
his
sentiments
and
that
concluded
the
business
i
am
sure
and
i
do
wonder
at
it
i
only
hope
that
you
wo
ask
me
to
do
anything
i
do
not
wish
to
do
for
i
am
sure
that
i
could
never
refuse
you
anything
i
am
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
mr
philip
for
if
i
see
you
do
that
which
i
think
wrong
i
shall
certainly
try
my
influence
over
you
replied
miss
trevannion
smiling
i
really
was
not
aware
that
i
had
such
power
here
mr
trevannion
came
in
again
and
the
conversation
was
changed
and
shortly
afterwards
miss
trevannion
left
the
room
philip
who
was
tired
of
sitting
while
mr
trevannion
and
i
took
our
pipes
and
who
was
anxious
to
see
the
town
also
left
us
and
i
then
stated
to
mr
trevannion
that
having
now
completed
the
cruise
which
i
had
agreed
that
i
would
i
wished
to
know
whether
he
had
provided
himself
with
another
captain
as
you
appear
so
determined
my
dear
elrington
i
will
only
say
that
i
am
very
sorry
and
will
not
urge
the
matter
any
longer
my
daughter
told
me
since
your
absence
that
she
was
certain
you
would
adhere
to
your
resolution
and
although
i
hoped
the
contrary
yet
i
have
been
considering
in
which
way
i
can
serve
you
it
is
not
only
my
pleasure
but
my
duty
so
to
do
i
have
not
forgotten
and
never
will
forget
that
you
in
all
probability
saved
my
life
by
your
in
the
affair
of
the
jacobites
when
you
first
came
to
me
you
were
recommended
as
a
good
accountant
and
to
a
certain
degree
a
man
of
business
and
at
all
events
you
proved
yourself
well
acquainted
and
apt
at
figures
do
you
think
that
a
situation
on
shore
would
suit
you
i
should
endeavour
to
give
satisfaction
sir
i
replied
but
i
fear
that
i
should
have
much
to
learn
of
course
you
would
but
i
reply
that
you
would
soon
learn
now
elrington
what
i
have
to
say
to
you
is
this
i
am
getting
old
and
in
a
few
years
shall
be
past
work
and
i
think
i
should
like
you
as
an
assistant
for
the
present
and
a
successor
hereafter
if
you
would
like
to
join
me
you
shall
superintend
the
more
active
portion
of
the
business
and
i
have
no
doubt
but
that
in
a
year
or
two
you
will
be
master
of
the
whole
as
you
know
i
have
privateers
and
i
have
merchant
vessels
and
i
keep
my
storehouses
i
have
done
well
up
to
the
present
not
so
well
perhaps
now
as
i
did
when
i
had
which
were
most
profitable
but
my
deceased
wife
persuaded
me
to
give
up
that
traffic
and
i
have
not
resumed
it
in
honour
of
her
memory
these
foolish
women
should
never
interfere
in
such
matters
but
let
that
pass
what
i
have
to
say
is
that
if
you
choose
after
a
year
to
join
me
as
a
partner
i
will
give
you
an
eighth
of
the
business
and
as
we
continue
i
will
make
over
a
further
share
in
proportion
to
the
profits
and
i
will
make
such
arrangements
as
to
enable
you
at
my
death
to
take
the
whole
concern
upon
favourable
terms
mr
trevannion
knocked
the
ashes
out
of
his
pipe
and
as
he
concluded
i
am
i
replied
as
you
may
imagine
sir
much
gratified
and
honoured
at
your
proposal
which
i
hardly
need
say
that
i
willingly
accept
i
only
hope
you
will
make
allowance
for
my
ignorance
at
first
setting
off
and
not
ascribe
to
any
other
cause
my
imperfections
you
may
assure
yourself
that
shall
never
be
wanting
on
my
part
and
i
shall
work
day
and
night
if
required
to
prove
my
gratitude
for
so
kind
an
offer
then
it
is
settled
said
mr
trevannion
but
what
are
we
to
do
with
your
brother
philip
he
thinks
for
himself
sir
and
does
not
agree
with
me
on
the
question
in
point
of
course
i
have
no
right
to
insist
that
my
scruples
should
be
his
indeed
i
fear
that
i
should
have
little
chance
in
persuading
him
as
he
is
so
fond
of
a
life
of
adventure
it
is
natural
in
one
so
young
age
will
sober
him
then
you
have
no
objection
to
his
going
on
board
of
a
privateer
i
would
rather
that
he
was
in
any
other
service
sir
but
as
i
can
not
control
him
i
must
submit
if
he
insist
upon
following
that
profession
he
is
a
gallant
clever
boy
and
as
soon
as
i
can
i
will
try
to
procure
him
a
situation
in
a
king
ship
at
present
he
must
go
to
sea
in
some
way
or
the
other
and
it
were
perhaps
better
that
he
should
be
in
good
hands
such
as
captain
levee
for
instance
on
board
of
a
privateer
than
mix
up
with
those
who
might
demoralise
him
more
well
then
he
shall
have
his
choice
replied
mr
trevannion
he
is
a
smart
lad
and
will
do
you
credit
wherever
he
may
be
if
i
may
take
the
liberty
to
advise
sir
replied
i
i
think
you
could
not
do
better
than
to
give
the
command
of
the
to
the
chief
officer
mr
james
he
is
a
good
seaman
and
a
brave
man
and
i
have
no
doubt
will
acquit
himself
to
your
satisfaction
i
was
thinking
the
same
and
as
you
recommend
him
he
shall
take
your
place
now
as
all
this
is
settled
you
may
as
well
go
on
board
and
make
known
that
you
have
resigned
the
command
tell
mr
james
that
he
is
to
take
your
place
bring
your
clothes
on
shore
and
you
will
find
apartments
ready
for
you
on
your
return
for
in
future
you
will
of
course
consider
this
house
as
your
residence
i
assure
you
that
now
that
you
do
not
leave
me
i
am
almost
glad
that
the
affair
is
arranged
as
it
is
i
wanted
assistance
that
is
the
fact
and
i
hold
myself
fortunate
that
you
are
the
party
who
has
been
selected
we
shall
meet
in
the
evening
mr
trevannion
then
went
away
in
the
direction
of
his
daughter
room
instead
of
the
as
usual
and
i
quitted
the
house
i
did
not
go
immediately
down
to
the
wharf
to
embark
i
wanted
to
have
a
short
time
for
reflection
for
i
was
much
overpowered
with
mr
trevannion
kindness
and
the
happy
prospects
before
me
i
walked
out
into
the
country
for
some
distance
deep
in
my
own
reflections
and
i
must
say
that
miss
trevannion
was
too
often
interfering
with
my
train
of
thought
i
had
of
course
no
fixed
ideas
but
i
more
than
once
was
weighing
in
my
mind
whether
i
should
not
make
known
to
them
who
i
was
and
how
superior
in
birth
to
what
they
imagined
after
an
hour
passed
in
building
castles
i
retraced
my
steps
passed
through
the
town
and
going
down
to
the
wharf
waved
my
handkerchief
for
a
boat
and
was
soon
on
board
i
then
summoned
the
officers
and
men
told
them
that
i
had
resigned
the
command
of
the
vessel
and
that
in
future
they
were
to
consider
mr
james
as
their
captain
i
packed
up
my
clothes
leaving
many
articles
for
my
successor
which
were
no
longer
of
any
use
to
me
but
which
he
would
have
been
compelled
to
replace
philip
i
found
was
down
in
the
cabin
and
with
him
i
had
a
long
conversation
he
stated
his
wish
to
remain
at
sea
saying
that
he
preferred
a
privateer
to
a
merchant
vessel
and
a
king
ship
to
a
privateer
not
being
old
enough
or
sufficient
time
at
sea
to
be
eligible
for
a
king
ship
i
agreed
that
he
should
sail
with
captain
levee
as
soon
as
he
came
back
from
his
cruise
he
had
already
sent
in
a
good
prize
as
soon
as
my
clothes
and
other
articles
were
put
into
the
boat
i
wished
them
all
farewell
and
was
cheered
by
the
men
as
i
pulled
on
shore
my
effects
were
taken
up
to
mr
trevannion
house
by
the
seamen
to
whom
i
gave
a
gratuity
and
i
was
met
by
mr
trevannion
who
showed
me
into
a
large
and
which
he
told
me
was
in
future
to
be
considered
as
my
own
i
passed
away
the
afternoon
in
arranging
my
clothes
and
did
not
go
down
to
the
parlour
till
where
i
found
miss
trevannion
who
congratulated
me
upon
my
having
changed
my
occupation
to
one
more
worthy
of
me
i
made
a
suitable
reply
and
we
sat
down
to
supper
having
described
this
first
great
event
in
my
life
i
shall
for
the
present
conclude
chapter
thirteen
after
staying
a
year
with
him
trevannion
proposes
to
take
me
into
partnership
but
i
decline
the
offer
from
conscientious
motives
miss
trevannion
treats
me
with
unmerited
coldness
this
and
her
anger
make
me
resolve
to
quit
the
house
what
i
overhear
and
see
before
my
departure
the
ring
you
may
now
behold
me
in
a
very
different
position
my
dear
madam
instead
of
the
laced
hat
and
hanger
at
my
side
imagine
me
in
a
plain
suit
of
grey
with
black
buttons
and
a
pen
behind
my
ear
instead
of
walking
the
deck
and
balancing
to
the
motion
of
the
vessel
i
am
now
perched
immoveably
upon
a
high
stool
instead
of
sweeping
the
horizon
with
my
telescope
or
watching
the
straining
and
bending
of
the
spars
aloft
i
am
now
with
my
eyes
incessantly
fixed
upon
the
ledger
or
absorbed
in
calculation
you
may
inquire
how
i
liked
the
change
at
first
i
must
confess
not
and
notwithstanding
my
dislike
to
the
life
of
a
privateersman
i
often
sighed
heavily
and
wished
that
i
were
an
officer
in
the
king
service
the
change
from
a
life
of
activity
to
one
of
sedentary
habits
was
too
sudden
and
i
often
found
myself
with
my
eyes
still
fixed
upon
the
figures
before
me
absorbed
in
a
sort
of
reverie
in
which
i
was
boarding
or
chasing
the
enemy
handling
my
cutlass
and
sometimes
so
moved
by
my
imagination
as
to
brandish
my
arm
over
my
head
when
an
exclamation
of
surprise
from
one
of
the
clerks
would
remind
me
of
my
folly
and
angry
with
myself
i
would
once
more
resume
my
pen
but
after
a
time
i
had
more
command
over
myself
and
could
sit
steadily
at
my
work
mr
trevannion
had
often
observed
how
absent
i
was
and
it
was
a
source
of
amusement
to
him
when
we
met
at
dinner
his
daughter
would
say
so
i
hear
you
had
another
this
morning
mr
elrington
and
her
father
would
laugh
heartily
as
he
gave
a
description
of
my
ridiculous
conduct
i
very
soon
with
the
kind
assistance
of
mr
trevannion
became
master
of
my
work
and
gave
him
satisfaction
my
chief
employment
consisted
in
writing
the
letters
to
correspondents
at
first
i
only
copied
mr
trevannion
letters
in
his
private
but
as
i
became
aware
of
the
nature
of
the
correspondence
and
what
was
necessary
to
be
detailed
i
then
made
a
rough
copy
of
the
letters
and
submitted
them
to
mr
trevannion
for
his
approval
at
first
there
were
a
few
alterations
made
afterwards
i
wrote
them
fairly
out
and
almost
invariably
they
gave
satisfaction
or
if
anything
was
added
it
was
in
a
postscript
mr
trevannion
affairs
i
found
were
much
more
extensive
than
i
had
imagined
he
had
the
two
privateers
two
vessels
on
the
coast
of
africa
trading
for
ivory
and
and
other
articles
two
or
three
vessels
employed
in
trading
to
virginia
for
tobacco
and
other
produce
and
some
smaller
vessels
engaged
in
the
newfoundland
fisheries
which
when
they
had
taken
in
their
cargo
ran
to
the
mediterranean
to
dispose
of
it
and
returned
with
mediterranean
produce
to
liverpool
that
he
was
a
very
wealthy
man
independent
of
his
large
stakes
upon
the
seas
was
certain
he
had
lent
much
money
to
the
guild
of
liverpool
and
had
some
tenanted
properties
in
the
county
but
of
them
i
knew
nothing
except
from
the
payment
of
the
rents
what
surprised
me
much
was
that
a
man
of
mr
trevannion
wealth
having
but
one
child
to
provide
for
should
not
retire
from
business
and
i
once
made
the
remark
to
his
daughter
her
reply
was
i
thought
as
you
do
once
but
now
i
think
differently
when
i
have
been
on
a
visit
with
my
father
and
he
has
stayed
away
for
several
weeks
you
have
no
idea
how
restless
and
uneasy
he
has
become
from
want
of
occupation
it
has
become
his
habit
and
habit
is
second
nature
it
is
not
from
a
wish
to
accumulate
that
he
continues
at
the
but
because
he
can
not
be
happy
without
employment
i
therefore
do
not
any
longer
persuade
him
to
leave
off
as
i
am
convinced
that
it
would
be
persuading
him
to
be
unhappy
until
you
came
i
think
the
fatigue
was
too
great
for
him
but
you
have
as
he
apprises
me
relieved
him
of
the
heaviest
portion
of
the
labour
and
i
hardly
need
say
that
i
am
rejoiced
that
you
have
so
done
it
certainly
is
not
that
he
requires
to
make
money
miss
trevannion
and
as
he
is
so
liberal
in
everything
i
must
credit
what
you
assert
that
it
is
the
dislike
to
having
no
employment
which
induces
him
to
continue
in
business
it
has
not
yet
become
such
a
habit
in
me
continued
i
smiling
i
think
i
could
leave
it
off
with
great
pleasure
but
is
not
that
because
you
have
not
yet
recovered
from
your
former
habits
which
were
so
at
variance
with
a
quiet
and
a
sedentary
life
replied
she
i
fear
it
is
so
said
i
and
i
believe
of
all
habits
those
of
a
vagrant
are
the
most
difficult
to
overcome
you
used
to
laugh
at
me
the
first
few
months
that
i
was
here
i
presume
that
i
am
a
little
improved
as
i
have
not
been
attacked
lately
my
father
says
so
and
is
much
pleased
with
you
mr
elrington
if
my
telling
you
so
gives
you
any
satisfaction
certainly
it
does
because
i
wish
to
please
him
and
me
too
i
hope
yes
most
truly
miss
trevannion
i
only
wish
i
had
it
in
my
power
to
show
how
much
i
study
your
good
opinion
will
you
risk
my
father
displeasure
for
it
replied
she
looking
at
me
fixedly
yes
i
will
provided
oh
there
is
a
proviso
already
i
grant
that
there
should
not
have
been
any
as
i
am
sure
that
you
would
not
ask
me
to
do
anything
which
is
wrong
and
my
proviso
was
that
i
did
not
undertake
what
my
conscience
did
not
approve
your
proviso
was
good
mr
elrington
for
when
a
woman
would
persuade
a
man
should
be
particularly
guarded
that
he
is
not
led
into
error
by
a
rash
promise
i
think
however
that
we
are
both
agreed
upon
the
point
i
will
therefore
come
at
once
to
what
i
wish
you
to
do
it
is
the
intention
of
my
father
in
the
course
of
a
few
days
when
you
shall
have
accomplished
your
year
of
service
to
offer
to
take
you
into
partnership
and
i
am
certain
it
will
be
on
liberal
terms
now
i
wish
you
to
refuse
his
offer
unless
he
gives
up
privateering
i
will
do
so
at
all
risks
and
i
am
truly
glad
that
i
have
your
encouragement
for
taking
such
a
bold
step
i
tell
you
frankly
that
he
will
be
very
indignant
there
is
an
excitement
about
the
privateering
which
has
become
almost
necessary
to
him
and
he
cares
little
about
the
remainder
of
his
speculations
he
is
so
blind
to
the
immorality
to
which
it
leads
that
he
does
not
think
it
is
an
unlawful
pursuit
if
he
did
i
am
sure
that
he
would
abandon
it
all
my
persuasion
has
been
useless
and
if
a
favourite
and
only
daughter
can
not
prevail
what
chance
have
i
miss
trevannion
a
better
chance
mr
elrington
he
is
partial
to
me
but
i
am
a
woman
and
he
looks
upon
my
observations
as
a
woman
weakness
the
objections
raised
by
a
man
a
young
man
and
one
who
has
so
long
been
actively
engaged
in
the
service
will
therefore
carry
more
weight
besides
he
has
now
become
so
accustomed
to
you
and
has
had
so
much
trouble
taken
off
his
hands
and
at
the
same
time
has
such
implicit
confidence
in
you
that
i
do
not
think
if
he
finds
that
he
has
to
choose
between
your
leaving
him
and
his
leaving
off
privateering
he
will
hesitate
in
relinquishing
the
latter
you
have
moreover
great
weight
with
him
mr
elrington
my
father
is
fully
aware
of
the
deep
obligation
he
is
under
to
your
courage
and
in
the
affair
of
the
jacobite
refugees
you
will
therefore
succeed
if
you
are
firm
and
if
you
do
succeed
you
will
have
my
gratitude
if
that
is
of
any
importance
to
you
my
friendship
you
know
you
have
already
the
entrance
of
mr
trevannion
prevented
my
reply
we
had
been
waiting
for
his
return
from
a
walk
and
dinner
had
been
ready
some
time
i
have
just
seen
some
of
the
men
of
the
arrow
said
mr
trevannion
taking
off
his
hat
and
spencer
and
that
detained
me
has
captain
levee
arrived
then
sir
said
i
no
but
he
has
sent
in
a
prize
of
no
great
value
laden
with
light
wares
the
men
in
charge
tell
me
he
has
had
a
rough
affair
with
a
vessel
armed
and
that
he
has
lost
some
men
your
brother
philip
as
usual
is
wounded
i
should
here
observe
that
during
the
year
which
had
passed
away
the
two
privateers
had
been
several
times
in
port
they
had
met
with
moderate
success
barely
sufficient
to
pay
their
expenses
my
brother
philip
had
always
conducted
himself
very
gallantly
and
had
been
twice
wounded
in
different
engagements
well
sir
replied
i
i
do
not
think
that
the
loss
of
a
little
blood
will
do
any
harm
to
such
a
youth
as
master
philip
but
i
hope
in
a
short
time
to
give
him
an
opportunity
of
shedding
it
in
the
service
of
the
king
instead
of
in
the
pursuit
of
money
indeed
continued
i
as
i
sat
down
to
table
the
enemy
are
now
so
cautious
or
have
so
few
vessels
on
the
high
seas
that
i
fear
your
privateering
account
current
will
not
be
very
favourable
when
balanced
as
it
will
be
in
a
few
days
notwithstanding
this
cargo
of
wares
just
arrived
then
we
must
hope
better
for
next
year
replied
mr
trevannion
amy
my
dear
have
you
been
out
yes
sir
i
was
riding
for
two
hours
have
they
altered
your
pillion
yet
yes
sir
it
came
home
last
night
and
it
is
now
very
comfortable
i
called
at
mrs
carleton
who
is
much
better
what
a
fop
that
mr
carleton
is
i
do
know
what
scented
powder
he
uses
but
it
perfumed
the
whole
room
had
not
mrs
carleton
been
such
an
invalid
i
should
have
opened
the
window
mr
trevannion
then
turned
the
conversation
to
some
political
intelligence
which
he
had
just
received
and
this
engaged
us
till
the
dinner
was
over
and
i
returned
to
the
where
i
found
the
men
who
had
brought
in
the
prize
and
who
gave
me
a
letter
from
philip
stating
that
his
wound
was
of
no
consequence
the
communication
of
mr
trevannion
took
place
as
his
daughter
had
assured
me
it
would
on
the
anniversary
of
my
entering
into
mr
trevannion
after
dinner
as
we
as
usual
were
smoking
our
pipes
mr
trevannion
said
elrington
you
have
been
with
me
now
one
year
and
during
that
time
you
have
made
yourself
fully
master
of
your
business
much
to
my
surprise
i
acknowledge
but
still
more
to
my
satisfaction
that
i
have
every
reason
to
be
satisfied
with
you
you
may
imagine
when
i
tell
you
that
it
is
now
my
intention
to
take
you
into
partnership
and
i
trust
by
my
so
doing
that
you
will
soon
be
an
independent
man
you
know
the
capital
in
the
business
as
well
as
i
do
i
did
say
an
eighth
but
i
now
propose
to
make
ever
to
you
and
to
allow
your
profits
of
every
year
deducting
your
necessary
expenses
to
be
invested
in
the
business
until
you
have
acquired
a
right
to
one
half
of
future
arrangements
we
will
speak
hereafter
mr
trevannion
replied
it
that
i
am
truly
grateful
for
such
unexpected
liberality
i
hardly
need
say
and
you
have
my
best
thanks
for
your
noble
offer
but
i
have
scruples
which
i
must
confess
i
can
not
get
over
scruples
exclaimed
mr
trevannion
laying
down
his
pipe
on
the
table
oh
i
see
now
continued
he
after
a
pause
you
think
i
am
robbing
my
daughter
no
no
the
labourer
is
worthy
of
his
hire
and
she
will
have
more
than
sufficient
you
carry
your
conscientiousness
too
far
my
dear
fellow
i
have
more
than
enough
for
amy
out
of
the
business
altogether
i
am
aware
of
that
sir
added
i
and
i
did
not
therefore
refer
to
your
daughter
when
i
said
that
i
had
scruples
i
must
be
candid
with
you
sir
how
is
it
that
i
am
now
in
your
employ
why
because
you
had
a
dislike
to
privateering
and
i
had
a
debt
of
gratitude
to
pay
exactly
sir
but
whether
you
had
been
pleased
to
employ
me
or
not
i
had
made
up
my
mind
as
you
well
know
from
conscientious
motives
not
to
continue
on
board
of
a
privateer
well
i
grant
that
the
same
motives
sir
will
not
allow
me
to
be
a
sharer
in
the
profits
arising
from
such
sources
i
should
consider
myself
equally
wrong
if
i
did
so
as
if
i
remained
on
board
do
not
be
angry
with
me
sir
continued
i
if
i
with
many
thanks
decline
your
offer
of
being
your
partner
i
will
faithfully
serve
you
upon
any
salary
which
you
may
consider
i
may
merit
and
trust
to
your
liberality
in
everything
mr
trevannion
made
no
reply
he
had
resumed
his
pipe
and
continued
to
smoke
it
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
as
soon
as
his
pipe
was
out
he
rose
put
on
his
hat
and
walked
out
of
the
room
without
making
any
further
observation
i
waited
a
few
minutes
and
then
went
back
to
the
that
mr
trevannion
was
seriously
offended
i
was
convinced
but
i
valued
the
good
opinion
of
his
daughter
more
than
i
did
that
of
mr
trevannion
indeed
my
feelings
towards
her
had
during
the
year
that
i
had
been
in
the
house
gradually
become
of
that
nature
that
they
threatened
much
my
peace
of
mind
i
can
not
say
that
i
loved
her
in
the
usual
acceptation
of
the
term
adoration
would
better
express
what
i
felt
she
was
so
pure
so
perfect
such
a
model
of
female
perfection
that
i
looked
up
to
her
with
a
reverence
which
almost
quelled
any
feeling
of
love
i
felt
that
she
was
above
me
and
that
with
her
wealth
it
would
be
madness
for
one
in
my
present
position
to
aspire
to
her
yet
with
this
feeling
i
would
have
sacrificed
all
my
hopes
and
present
advantages
to
have
obtained
her
approving
smiles
it
is
not
therefore
to
be
wondered
at
that
i
risked
mr
trevannion
displeasure
to
gain
her
approbation
and
when
i
resumed
my
seat
at
my
desk
and
thought
of
what
had
passed
i
made
up
my
mind
to
be
once
more
an
outcast
in
the
world
rather
than
swerve
from
the
promise
which
i
had
made
to
her
i
knew
mr
trevannion
to
be
a
very
decided
man
and
hasty
when
offended
that
he
was
seriously
offended
with
me
there
was
no
doubt
i
found
that
he
had
quitted
the
house
immediately
after
he
had
left
the
room
i
had
hoped
that
he
had
gone
to
his
daughter
apartments
and
that
a
conversation
with
her
might
have
produced
a
good
effect
but
such
was
not
the
case
in
about
half
an
hour
mr
trevannion
returned
and
as
he
walked
into
the
back
room
adjoining
the
he
desired
me
to
follow
him
i
did
so
mr
elrington
said
he
sitting
down
and
leaving
me
standing
at
the
table
i
fear
after
what
has
passed
that
we
shall
not
continue
on
good
terms
you
have
reproached
me
an
old
man
with
carrying
on
an
unlawful
business
in
short
in
raising
your
own
scruples
and
talking
of
your
own
conscience
you
have
implied
that
i
am
acting
contrary
to
what
conscience
should
dictate
in
short
you
have
told
me
by
implication
that
i
am
not
an
honest
man
you
have
thrown
back
in
my
face
my
liberal
offer
my
wish
to
oblige
you
has
been
treated
not
only
with
indifference
but
i
may
add
with
contumely
and
that
merely
because
you
have
formed
some
absurd
notions
of
right
and
wrong
in
which
you
will
find
no
one
to
agree
with
you
except
perhaps
priests
and
women
i
wish
you
well
mr
elrington
nevertheless
i
am
truly
sorry
for
your
infatuation
and
wished
to
have
served
you
but
you
will
not
be
assisted
by
me
here
mr
trevannion
paused
but
i
made
no
reply
after
a
time
wiping
the
perspiration
from
his
forehead
with
his
handkerchief
for
he
evidently
was
in
a
state
of
great
excitement
he
continued
as
you
do
not
choose
to
join
me
from
conscientious
scruples
i
can
not
but
imagine
that
you
do
not
like
to
serve
me
from
similar
motives
for
i
see
little
difference
between
the
two
and
here
madam
there
was
some
force
in
his
observation
but
it
never
occurred
to
me
before
at
all
events
without
weighing
your
scruples
so
exactly
as
to
know
how
far
they
may
or
may
not
extend
i
feel
that
we
are
not
likely
to
get
on
pleasantly
together
i
shall
always
think
that
i
am
reproached
by
you
when
anything
is
said
connected
with
the
privateers
and
you
may
have
twinges
of
conscience
which
may
be
disagreeable
to
you
let
us
therefore
part
quietly
for
your
services
up
to
the
present
and
to
assist
you
in
any
other
engagements
you
may
enter
on
take
this
mr
trevannion
opened
a
lower
drawer
of
the
table
and
put
before
me
a
bag
containing
as
i
afterwards
discovered
gold
jacobuses
i
wish
you
well
mr
elrington
but
i
sincerely
wish
that
we
had
never
met
mr
trevannion
then
rose
abruptly
and
before
i
could
make
my
reply
brushed
past
me
went
out
at
the
door
and
again
walked
away
at
a
rapid
pace
down
the
street
i
remained
where
i
stood
my
eyes
had
followed
him
as
he
went
away
i
was
completely
surprised
i
anticipated
much
anger
much
altercation
but
i
never
had
an
idea
that
he
would
be
so
unjust
as
to
throw
off
in
this
way
one
who
for
his
sake
had
gone
through
a
heavy
trial
and
come
out
with
honour
my
heart
was
full
of
bitterness
i
felt
that
mr
trevannion
had
treated
me
with
harshness
and
ingratitude
alas
thought
i
such
is
the
world
and
such
will
ever
be
the
case
with
such
imperfect
beings
as
we
are
how
vain
to
expect
anything
like
consistency
much
less
perfection
in
our
erring
natures
hurt
but
the
of
a
man
wound
his
vanity
and
all
obligations
are
forgotten
i
turned
away
from
the
bag
of
money
which
i
was
resolved
not
to
accept
although
i
had
not
at
the
time
twenty
guineas
at
my
own
disposal
it
was
now
within
half
an
hour
of
dark
i
collected
all
my
books
put
some
in
the
iron
safe
others
as
usual
in
my
desk
and
having
arranged
everything
as
completely
as
i
could
i
locked
the
safe
and
enclosed
the
keys
in
a
parcel
which
i
sealed
putting
mr
trevannion
name
on
the
outside
i
laid
the
parcel
on
the
table
in
the
room
where
we
had
had
our
conference
by
the
side
of
the
bag
of
money
it
was
now
dark
or
nearly
so
and
leaving
the
confidential
porter
as
usual
to
shut
up
the
house
i
went
up
to
the
with
the
expectation
of
seeing
miss
trevannion
and
bidding
her
farewell
i
was
not
disappointed
i
found
her
at
her
netting
having
just
lighted
the
lamp
which
hung
over
the
table
miss
trevannion
said
i
advancing
respectfully
towards
her
i
have
fulfilled
my
promise
and
i
have
received
my
reward
she
looked
up
at
me
which
is
i
am
dismissed
from
this
house
and
your
presence
for
ever
i
trust
said
she
after
a
pause
that
you
have
not
exceeded
my
wishes
it
appears
to
me
so
strange
that
i
must
think
that
such
is
the
case
my
father
never
could
have
dismissed
you
in
this
way
for
merely
expressing
an
opinion
mr
elrington
you
must
have
gone
too
far
miss
trevannion
when
you
meet
your
father
you
can
then
ascertain
whether
i
have
been
guilty
of
intemperance
or
rudeness
or
a
proper
want
of
respect
in
making
the
communication
which
i
did
in
exactly
the
manner
you
yourself
proposed
and
my
reward
has
been
such
as
i
state
you
have
a
better
reward
mr
elrington
if
what
you
assert
is
really
correct
you
have
the
reward
of
having
done
your
duty
but
i
can
not
imagine
that
your
dismissal
has
arisen
from
the
mere
expression
of
an
opinion
you
excuse
me
mr
elrington
that
as
a
daughter
i
can
not
in
justice
to
a
father
believe
that
such
is
the
case
this
was
said
in
so
cold
a
manner
that
i
was
nettled
to
the
highest
degree
miss
trevannion
had
promised
me
her
gratitude
instead
of
which
i
felt
that
she
was
doubting
my
word
and
as
it
were
taking
the
side
of
her
father
against
me
and
this
was
the
return
from
her
i
could
have
upbraided
her
and
told
her
what
i
felt
namely
that
she
had
taken
advantage
of
my
feelings
towards
her
to
make
me
a
to
obtain
her
end
with
her
father
and
that
now
having
failed
i
was
left
to
my
fate
without
even
commiseration
but
she
looked
so
calm
so
grave
and
so
beautiful
that
i
could
not
do
it
i
commanded
my
wounded
feelings
and
replied
since
i
have
the
misfortune
to
meet
the
displeasure
of
the
daughter
as
well
as
of
the
father
miss
trevannion
i
have
not
another
word
to
say
but
farewell
and
may
you
prosper
my
voice
faltered
as
i
said
the
last
words
and
bowing
to
her
i
quitted
the
room
miss
trevannion
did
not
even
say
farewell
to
me
but
i
thought
that
her
lips
appeared
to
move
as
quitting
the
room
i
took
my
last
look
upon
her
beautiful
face
i
shut
the
door
after
me
and
overpowered
by
my
feelings
i
sank
upon
a
settee
in
the
in
a
state
of
giddy
stupor
i
know
not
how
long
i
remained
there
for
my
head
turned
and
my
senses
reeled
but
i
was
aroused
from
it
by
the
heavy
tread
of
mr
trevannion
who
came
along
the
corridor
without
a
light
and
not
perceiving
me
opened
the
door
of
the
where
his
daughter
still
remained
he
threw
the
door
to
after
he
had
entered
but
it
did
not
quite
close
leaving
a
narrow
stream
of
light
through
the
father
said
miss
trevannion
in
my
hearing
you
look
warm
and
excited
i
have
reason
so
to
be
replied
mr
trevannion
abruptly
i
have
heard
from
mr
elrington
the
cause
of
it
replied
miss
trevannion
that
is
i
have
heard
his
version
of
it
i
am
glad
that
you
have
come
back
as
i
am
most
anxious
to
hear
yours
what
has
mr
elrington
said
or
done
to
cause
such
irritation
and
his
dismissal
he
has
behaved
with
insolence
and
ingratitude
replied
mr
trevannion
i
offered
him
partnership
and
he
refused
unless
i
would
give
up
privateering
so
he
stated
but
in
what
manner
was
he
insolent
to
you
insolent
told
me
that
he
acted
from
conscientious
motives
which
was
as
much
as
to
say
that
i
did
not
was
his
language
very
offensive
no
not
his
language
that
was
respectful
enough
but
it
was
the
very
respect
which
made
it
insolent
so
i
told
him
that
as
he
could
not
from
scruples
of
conscience
join
me
in
privateering
of
course
his
scruples
of
conscience
could
not
allow
him
to
keep
the
books
and
i
dismissed
him
do
you
mean
to
say
my
dear
father
that
he
in
a
respectful
manner
declined
entering
into
partnership
from
these
scruples
which
you
mention
that
he
gave
you
no
other
offence
than
expressing
his
opinion
and
declining
your
offer
and
what
would
you
have
more
replied
mr
trevannion
i
wish
to
know
where
was
the
insult
the
ingratitude
on
his
part
which
you
complain
of
simply
in
refusing
the
offer
he
ought
to
have
felt
grateful
and
he
was
not
and
he
had
no
right
to
give
such
reasons
as
he
did
for
the
reasons
were
condemning
my
actions
but
you
women
can
not
understand
these
things
i
rather
think
my
dear
father
that
we
can
not
for
i
can
not
perceive
either
the
insult
or
the
ingratitude
which
you
complain
of
and
such
i
think
will
be
your
own
opinion
when
you
have
had
time
to
reflect
and
are
more
cool
mr
elrington
expressed
nothing
more
when
he
stated
his
dislike
to
privateering
from
conscientious
motives
than
he
did
after
his
return
from
his
confinement
in
the
tower
when
he
gave
up
the
command
of
the
privateer
on
those
very
grounds
and
then
when
still
warm
with
gratitude
to
him
for
his
you
did
not
consider
it
an
insult
but
on
the
contrary
took
him
still
nearer
to
you
into
your
own
house
why
then
should
you
consider
it
an
insult
now
neither
can
i
see
any
ingratitude
you
made
him
an
offer
the
value
of
which
in
a
worldly
point
of
view
he
could
not
but
appreciate
and
he
declined
it
from
conscientious
motives
declined
it
as
you
acknowledge
respectfully
proving
that
he
was
ready
to
sacrifice
his
worldly
interests
to
what
he
considered
his
duty
as
a
christian
when
mr
elrington
told
me
that
you
had
dismissed
him
i
felt
so
certain
that
he
must
have
been
guilty
of
some
unpardonable
conduct
towards
you
to
have
induced
you
to
have
resorted
to
such
a
step
that
i
did
not
credit
him
when
he
asserted
the
contrary
i
could
not
believe
as
a
daughter
anything
so
much
to
the
prejudice
of
my
own
father
and
so
much
at
variance
with
his
general
conduct
i
now
feel
that
i
have
been
most
unjust
to
mr
elrington
and
conducted
myself
towards
him
in
a
way
which
i
bitterly
regret
and
hope
by
some
means
to
be
able
to
express
my
contrition
for
amy
amy
said
mr
trevannion
severely
are
you
blinded
by
regard
for
this
young
man
that
you
side
against
your
own
father
am
i
to
understand
that
you
have
given
your
affections
without
my
sanction
or
approval
no
sir
replied
miss
trevannion
that
i
do
respect
and
regard
mr
elrington
is
true
and
i
can
not
do
otherwise
for
his
many
good
qualities
and
his
devotion
towards
you
but
if
you
would
ask
me
if
i
love
him
i
reply
that
such
a
thought
has
not
yet
entered
my
head
without
a
knowledge
of
who
he
is
or
his
family
and
without
your
approval
i
should
never
think
of
yielding
up
my
affections
in
so
hasty
a
manner
but
i
may
say
more
these
affections
have
never
been
solicited
by
mr
elrington
he
has
always
behaved
towards
me
with
that
respect
which
as
the
daughter
of
his
patron
i
have
had
a
right
to
expect
but
in
no
instance
has
he
ever
signified
to
me
that
he
had
any
preference
in
my
favour
having
assured
you
of
this
my
dear
father
i
can
not
but
say
that
i
consider
that
he
has
in
this
instance
not
only
been
treated
with
injustice
by
you
but
also
by
me
say
no
more
replied
mr
trevannion
as
he
said
this
i
heard
footsteps
in
the
passage
and
was
about
to
retreat
to
my
own
room
but
as
the
party
came
without
a
light
i
remained
it
was
the
porter
who
knocked
at
the
door
and
was
requested
to
come
in
by
mr
trevannion
if
you
please
sir
mr
elrington
is
gone
out
i
believe
and
i
found
this
packet
directed
to
you
on
the
table
of
the
inner
room
and
also
this
bag
of
money
which
i
suppose
you
forgot
to
put
away
before
you
left
very
well
humphrey
leave
them
on
the
table
the
man
did
so
and
quitted
the
room
not
perceiving
me
in
the
dark
as
he
passed
through
the
he
has
not
taken
the
money
observed
mr
trevannion
he
might
have
done
so
as
he
ought
to
be
paid
for
his
services
i
presume
my
dear
father
that
his
feelings
were
too
much
hurt
by
what
passed
said
miss
trevannion
there
are
obligations
which
can
not
be
repaid
with
gold
these
i
perceive
are
the
keys
of
the
safe
i
did
not
think
that
he
would
have
gone
away
this
night
i
now
considered
it
high
time
to
quit
the
where
i
had
been
irresistibly
detained
by
the
conversation
which
took
place
i
hastened
to
my
own
chamber
determined
that
i
would
leave
the
house
the
next
morning
before
any
one
was
stirring
i
gained
it
in
the
dark
but
having
the
means
of
striking
a
light
i
did
so
and
packed
up
all
my
clothes
ready
for
my
departure
i
had
just
fastened
down
my
valise
when
i
perceived
a
light
on
the
further
end
of
the
long
corridor
which
led
to
my
apartment
thinking
it
might
be
mr
trevannion
and
not
wishing
to
see
him
i
blew
out
my
own
light
and
retreated
to
a
small
within
my
chamber
communicating
by
a
glass
door
the
light
evidently
approached
and
at
last
i
perceived
the
party
was
entering
my
room
the
door
of
which
was
wide
open
it
was
miss
trevannion
who
entered
and
turning
round
with
her
in
her
hand
appeared
to
survey
the
apartment
with
a
mournful
air
she
perceived
my
valise
and
her
eyes
were
fixed
upon
it
for
some
time
at
last
she
walked
up
to
the
and
sitting
on
the
stool
before
it
leant
down
her
head
upon
her
hands
and
wept
alas
thought
i
if
those
tears
were
but
for
me
but
it
is
not
so
she
has
been
excited
and
her
tears
have
come
to
her
relief
after
a
time
she
raised
her
head
from
the
table
and
said
how
unjust
have
i
been
and
i
shall
see
him
no
more
if
i
could
but
beg
his
pardon
i
should
be
more
happy
poor
fellow
what
must
he
have
felt
at
my
harsh
bearing
oh
my
father
i
could
not
have
believed
it
and
what
did
i
say
that
i
had
no
feeling
for
well
i
thought
so
at
the
time
but
now
i
am
not
quite
sure
that
i
was
correct
though
he
well
it
better
that
he
gone
but
i
can
not
bear
that
he
should
have
gone
as
he
has
done
how
his
opinion
of
me
must
have
changed
that
is
what
vexes
me
and
again
she
bent
her
head
down
on
the
table
and
wept
in
a
moment
she
again
rose
and
took
her
candle
in
her
hand
perceiving
on
the
a
small
gold
ring
which
i
had
taken
off
my
finger
the
day
before
and
had
forgotten
she
took
it
up
and
examined
it
after
a
little
while
she
laid
her
light
down
on
the
table
and
put
the
ring
upon
her
finger
i
will
keep
it
till
i
see
him
again
murmured
she
and
then
taking
her
light
she
walked
slowly
out
of
the
room
the
knowledge
i
had
gained
by
this
unintentional
on
my
part
was
the
source
of
much
reflection
and
as
i
lay
on
the
bed
without
taking
off
my
clothes
it
occupied
my
thoughts
till
the
day
began
to
break
that
i
still
retained
the
good
opinion
of
miss
trevannion
was
certain
and
the
mortification
i
had
endured
at
our
final
interview
was
now
wholly
removed
it
was
her
duty
to
suppose
her
parent
not
in
fault
till
the
contrary
was
proved
she
had
known
her
father
for
years
me
she
had
only
known
for
a
short
time
and
never
before
had
she
known
him
guilty
of
injustice
but
her
expressions
and
her
behaviour
in
my
room
was
it
possible
that
she
was
partial
to
me
more
partial
than
she
had
asserted
to
her
father
when
she
was
questioned
and
her
taking
away
the
ring
chapter
fourteen
a
conspiracy
which
ends
satisfactorily
to
all
parties
privateering
is
abandoned
and
captain
levee
and
philip
serve
the
king
the
night
passed
away
in
attempts
at
analysing
the
real
feelings
of
miss
trevannion
and
also
my
own
towards
her
and
now
that
i
was
to
be
separated
from
her
i
discovered
what
i
really
had
not
before
imagined
that
my
future
happiness
was
seriously
endangered
by
my
sentiments
towards
her
in
short
dear
madam
that
i
was
most
seriously
in
love
and
now
thought
i
of
what
avail
is
it
to
have
made
this
discovery
now
except
it
were
to
convince
me
as
miss
trevannion
had
said
that
it
were
better
that
i
were
gone
i
did
not
fail
to
call
to
mind
her
observation
about
my
unknown
parentage
and
family
and
this
i
reflected
upon
with
pleasure
as
it
was
the
chief
objection
raised
by
her
and
at
the
same
time
one
that
i
could
proudly
remove
from
my
birth
being
really
more
distinguished
than
her
own
should
i
make
it
known
how
could
i
we
should
probably
never
meet
again
all
this
and
much
more
was
canvassed
in
my
mind
during
the
night
and
also
another
question
of
more
real
importance
which
was
what
i
was
to
do
and
where
i
was
to
go
on
this
last
point
i
could
not
make
up
my
mind
but
i
determined
that
i
would
not
leave
liverpool
for
a
day
or
two
but
would
take
up
my
quarters
at
my
old
lodgings
where
i
had
lived
with
captain
levee
as
the
day
dawned
i
rose
from
the
bed
and
taking
my
valise
on
my
shoulder
i
went
softly
opened
the
and
shutting
it
again
carefully
i
hastened
down
the
street
as
fast
as
i
could
i
met
nobody
for
it
was
still
early
and
arrived
at
the
where
i
had
some
trouble
to
obtain
admittance
the
old
lady
at
last
opening
the
door
in
great
dishabille
captain
elrington
is
it
possible
exclaimed
she
why
what
the
matter
nothing
madam
replied
i
but
that
i
have
come
to
take
possession
of
your
lodgings
for
a
few
days
and
welcome
sir
replied
she
will
you
walk
while
i
make
myself
more
fit
to
be
seen
i
was
in
bed
and
fast
asleep
when
you
knocked
i
do
believe
i
was
dreaming
of
my
good
friend
captain
levee
i
went
and
threw
myself
on
the
old
settee
which
was
so
familiar
to
me
and
somehow
or
another
in
a
few
minutes
i
was
in
a
sound
sleep
how
long
i
might
have
slept
on
i
can
not
tell
but
in
less
than
an
hour
i
was
waked
up
by
loud
talking
and
laughter
and
a
few
seconds
afterwards
found
myself
embraced
by
my
brother
philip
and
captain
levee
the
arrow
had
anchored
at
break
of
day
and
they
had
just
come
on
shore
i
was
delighted
to
see
them
as
every
one
is
when
he
meets
with
friends
when
he
is
in
distress
i
briefly
stated
how
it
was
that
they
found
me
there
and
when
breakfast
was
on
the
table
i
entered
into
full
details
of
what
had
passed
with
the
exception
of
miss
trevannion
having
entered
my
room
that
i
considered
too
sacred
to
repeat
to
any
one
you
know
my
dear
elrington
said
captain
levee
that
i
have
not
the
scruples
which
you
have
relative
to
privateering
but
still
i
respect
the
conscientious
scruples
of
others
there
is
no
excuse
for
mr
trevannion
conduct
and
i
can
not
think
but
there
is
something
else
at
the
bottom
of
all
this
you
have
been
making
love
to
his
daughter
or
what
would
amount
to
the
same
thing
she
has
not
been
making
advances
to
you
i
have
not
dared
the
first
levee
and
you
do
not
know
her
to
suppose
her
capable
of
the
latter
well
if
she
had
done
so
there
would
have
been
no
harm
done
replied
he
but
i
will
say
no
more
as
you
look
so
grave
philip
and
i
will
now
call
upon
mr
trevannion
and
while
i
engage
the
old
gentleman
philip
shall
run
alongside
of
the
young
maiden
and
between
the
two
we
shall
get
our
bearings
and
distance
and
know
how
the
land
lies
and
i
will
tell
you
more
elrington
although
i
have
no
objection
to
be
captain
of
a
privateer
i
certainly
consider
the
command
of
a
king
ship
more
reputable
and
if
i
could
manage
to
get
the
arrow
hired
into
the
service
i
still
remaining
in
command
of
her
i
should
prefer
it
being
so
at
all
events
i
side
with
you
and
that
will
drive
the
old
gentleman
on
a
dead
come
along
philip
we
shall
be
with
you
in
two
hours
elrington
with
these
words
captain
levee
left
the
room
followed
by
my
brother
it
was
nearly
three
hours
before
they
returned
and
then
i
received
the
following
narratives
captain
levee
as
he
sat
down
said
now
philip
we
hear
your
account
first
well
mine
is
soon
told
replied
philip
i
had
made
up
my
mind
how
to
act
and
did
not
tell
captain
levee
what
i
intended
to
do
when
mr
trevannion
met
us
in
the
room
behind
the
he
appeared
very
much
flurried
he
shook
hands
with
captain
levee
and
offered
me
his
hand
which
i
refused
saying
trevannion
i
have
just
seen
my
brother
and
i
hardly
need
say
that
nothing
will
induce
me
to
remain
in
your
employ
i
will
therefore
thank
you
for
my
wages
at
your
convenience
young
man
cried
he
give
yourself
strange
airs
well
sir
you
shall
have
your
discharge
i
can
do
without
such
as
you
are
mr
trevannion
replied
i
i
must
say
it
we
are
better
born
and
better
bred
than
you
or
any
of
your
connexions
and
you
were
honoured
by
our
service
you
said
that
philip
then
you
were
wrong
i
told
the
truth
still
you
should
not
have
said
it
we
took
his
service
and
therefore
we
are
not
interrupted
philip
and
his
calling
names
brought
on
the
reply
you
must
admit
the
provocation
elrington
said
captain
levee
well
go
on
philip
said
mr
trevannion
in
a
great
passion
then
i
will
soon
rid
myself
of
the
obligation
call
this
afternoon
master
philip
and
you
shall
receive
your
wages
you
may
now
quit
the
room
i
did
so
and
put
my
hat
to
annoy
him
so
far
his
narrative
is
quite
correct
said
captain
levee
now
go
on
well
said
philip
instead
of
turning
out
of
the
house
i
turned
into
it
and
went
to
the
young
lady
i
opened
the
door
softly
and
found
her
with
her
hand
up
to
her
head
looking
very
sedate
and
sorrowful
philip
said
she
startled
me
i
am
glad
to
see
you
when
did
you
arrive
morning
miss
trevannion
sit
down
and
bear
me
company
for
a
time
have
you
seen
your
brother
have
miss
trevannion
replied
i
still
remaining
on
my
feet
i
have
just
seen
your
father
i
come
now
to
bid
you
farewell
i
have
left
the
privateer
and
shall
never
join
her
again
perhaps
i
may
never
see
you
again
either
which
believe
me
i
am
truly
sorry
for
she
covered
her
eyes
with
her
hand
as
she
leant
on
the
table
and
i
saw
a
tear
fall
as
she
said
is
a
sad
business
altogether
and
has
distressed
me
very
much
i
hope
your
brother
does
not
think
that
i
blame
him
tell
him
that
i
do
not
in
the
least
and
that
he
must
forget
my
behaviour
to
him
when
we
parted
i
did
him
injustice
and
i
beg
his
pardon
tell
him
so
philip
did
she
say
those
words
philip
yes
word
for
word
and
looked
like
an
angel
when
he
said
so
i
replied
that
i
would
certainly
deliver
her
message
but
that
i
must
not
remain
for
fear
of
mr
trevannion
finding
me
with
her
as
he
ordered
me
to
quit
the
house
said
she
can
be
the
matter
with
my
poor
father
miss
trevannion
said
i
was
very
angry
and
he
had
reason
for
i
was
very
saucy
and
that
the
truth
philip
what
did
you
say
to
him
i
hardly
know
replied
i
i
know
that
i
said
more
than
i
ought
for
i
was
very
angry
at
my
brother
dismissal
good
bye
miss
trevannion
miss
trevannion
was
taking
a
ring
off
her
finger
as
i
said
good
bye
and
i
thought
she
was
going
to
give
it
me
as
a
keepsake
but
after
a
little
hesitation
she
put
it
on
again
and
then
held
out
her
hand
saying
bye
master
philip
let
us
not
part
in
anger
at
all
events
i
took
her
hand
bowed
and
turned
away
to
quit
the
room
when
i
was
at
the
door
i
looked
round
and
she
was
sitting
with
her
face
in
her
hands
and
i
think
she
was
weeping
i
went
out
into
the
street
and
waited
for
captain
levee
and
there
an
end
of
my
story
well
now
i
give
you
my
portion
as
soon
as
philip
went
out
of
the
room
mr
trevannion
said
a
most
impudent
boy
and
i
am
glad
that
he
is
gone
you
are
of
course
aware
that
his
brother
has
left
me
and
the
cause
of
our
disagreement
sir
replied
i
drily
have
heard
the
whole
particulars
you
ever
hear
of
such
ridiculous
scruples
said
he
sir
i
heard
them
before
and
so
did
you
when
he
gave
up
the
command
of
the
privateer
and
i
respected
them
because
i
knew
that
mr
elrington
was
sincere
indeed
his
observations
on
that
head
are
undeniably
true
and
have
had
great
weight
with
me
so
much
so
that
i
intend
to
enter
into
the
king
service
as
soon
as
i
possibly
can
i
wish
you
had
seen
the
look
of
mr
trevannion
when
i
said
this
he
was
stupefied
that
i
captain
levee
who
had
commanded
his
vessels
so
long
i
the
very
of
a
privateersman
a
reckless
extravagant
should
also
presume
to
have
scruples
was
too
much
for
him
tu
brute
he
might
have
exclaimed
but
he
did
not
but
he
stared
at
me
without
speaking
for
some
time
at
last
he
said
the
golden
age
arrived
or
is
this
a
conspiracy
one
nor
the
other
sir
i
replied
follow
privateering
because
i
can
do
no
better
but
as
soon
as
i
can
do
better
i
shall
leave
it
off
said
mr
trevannion
would
wish
to
resign
the
command
at
once
if
so
i
beg
you
will
not
make
any
ceremony
have
not
wished
to
put
you
to
any
inconvenience
mr
trevannion
replied
i
as
you
kindly
beg
me
to
use
no
ceremony
i
will
take
advantage
of
your
offer
and
resign
the
command
of
the
arrow
this
day
surely
levee
you
have
not
done
so
yes
i
have
replied
captain
levee
and
i
have
done
so
in
the
first
place
out
of
friendship
to
you
and
in
the
second
because
i
wish
to
be
employed
in
the
king
service
and
my
only
chance
of
obtaining
that
wish
is
doing
what
i
have
done
how
will
that
effect
your
purpose
because
the
men
have
sailed
so
long
with
me
that
they
will
not
sail
under
any
other
person
if
i
tell
them
not
mr
trevannion
will
find
himself
in
an
awkward
position
and
i
think
we
can
force
him
to
hire
his
vessel
to
government
who
will
gladly
accept
such
a
one
as
the
arrow
that
i
believe
if
from
her
reputation
alone
replied
i
well
levee
i
thank
you
very
much
for
this
proof
of
sincere
friendship
the
plot
thickens
and
a
few
days
will
decide
the
question
very
true
and
now
let
me
finish
my
story
am
afraid
said
mr
trevannion
in
a
very
sarcastic
tone
i
shall
not
be
able
to
find
any
one
to
replace
you
in
this
moral
age
captain
levee
but
i
will
try
i
replied
will
now
answer
your
sarcasm
there
is
some
excuse
for
ignorant
seamen
before
the
mast
who
enter
on
board
of
privateers
they
are
indifferent
to
blood
and
carnage
and
their
feelings
are
blunted
there
is
some
excuse
even
for
decayed
gentlemen
like
me
mr
trevannion
for
i
am
a
gentleman
born
who
to
obtain
a
maintenance
without
labour
risk
their
lives
and
shed
their
blood
but
there
is
no
excuse
for
those
who
having
already
as
much
wealth
and
more
than
they
can
require
still
furnish
the
means
and
equip
vessels
of
this
description
to
commit
the
destruction
which
they
do
for
the
sake
of
gain
there
is
a
sermon
sir
for
you
from
a
captain
of
a
privateer
and
i
now
wish
you
good
morning
i
then
got
up
and
making
a
profound
bow
i
quitted
the
room
before
mr
trevannion
made
any
reply
and
here
i
am
now
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
wait
quietly
and
see
what
takes
place
but
first
i
shall
go
on
board
the
arrow
and
let
them
know
that
i
have
quarrelled
with
the
owner
the
men
are
not
very
well
pleased
as
it
is
with
their
want
of
success
these
two
last
voyages
and
it
will
require
but
little
to
blow
up
the
discontent
into
a
mutiny
come
philip
i
shall
want
you
to
assist
me
we
shall
be
back
to
dinner
elrington
when
i
was
again
alone
i
had
time
to
consider
what
had
passed
what
i
chiefly
dwelt
upon
was
the
interview
between
philip
and
miss
trevannion
her
message
to
me
her
hesitation
and
keeping
the
ring
i
could
not
help
surmising
that
our
feelings
towards
each
other
were
reciprocal
and
this
idea
gave
me
infinite
delight
and
repaid
me
for
all
that
had
passed
then
my
brother
hasty
declaration
to
her
father
that
we
were
better
born
and
bred
than
he
was
would
certainly
be
repeated
by
him
to
his
daughter
and
must
make
an
impression
and
what
would
mr
trevannion
do
would
he
give
way
to
the
unanimous
opinion
against
him
i
feared
not
at
least
without
another
struggle
all
these
questions
occupied
my
thoughts
till
the
return
of
captain
levee
and
philip
from
the
privateer
they
had
well
managed
their
business
the
crew
of
the
arrow
had
come
to
an
unanimous
resolution
that
they
would
not
sail
with
any
other
captain
but
captain
levee
and
that
if
he
did
resign
the
command
of
the
vessel
as
soon
as
their
wages
were
paid
and
they
received
their
share
of
they
would
leave
and
enter
into
the
king
service
that
afternoon
mr
trevannion
sent
for
the
officer
next
in
command
to
give
him
the
command
of
the
vessel
but
as
he
went
over
the
side
the
men
expecting
that
he
was
sent
for
for
that
purpose
told
him
that
they
would
serve
under
no
one
but
captain
levee
and
that
he
might
acquaint
the
owner
with
their
determination
this
put
the
finishing
blow
to
mr
trevannion
as
soon
as
this
was
communicated
to
him
he
was
wild
with
rage
in
being
thus
thwarted
in
every
way
as
i
afterwards
was
informed
he
went
even
to
his
daughter
acquainted
her
with
all
that
had
passed
and
gave
vent
to
his
indignation
accusing
her
of
being
a
party
in
the
conspiracy
but
this
was
to
be
his
last
effort
the
excitement
had
been
too
great
and
after
dinner
he
felt
so
unwell
that
he
went
to
bed
the
next
morning
he
was
in
a
raging
fever
and
at
times
delirious
the
fever
was
so
violent
that
the
doctors
had
much
to
do
to
reduce
it
and
for
ten
days
mr
trevannion
was
in
great
danger
at
last
it
was
got
under
leaving
him
in
a
state
of
great
weakness
and
exhaustion
and
his
recovery
was
anything
but
rapid
humphrey
the
porter
had
brought
us
this
intelligence
as
now
there
was
no
one
to
transact
the
business
of
the
house
and
the
poor
fellow
did
not
know
what
to
do
i
desired
him
to
apply
to
miss
trevannion
for
directions
and
told
him
that
although
i
would
not
enter
the
house
i
would
if
she
wished
it
see
to
the
more
important
concerns
which
could
not
be
neglected
she
was
then
attending
her
father
and
sent
me
a
message
requesting
as
a
favour
to
her
that
i
would
assist
all
i
could
in
the
dilemma
i
consequently
sent
for
the
books
and
gave
orders
and
made
the
necessary
arrangements
as
i
had
done
before
i
had
been
dismissed
by
mr
trevannion
it
was
nearly
five
weeks
before
mr
trevannion
had
sufficiently
recovered
to
mention
anything
about
business
to
him
and
then
it
was
that
he
learnt
from
his
daughter
that
i
had
carried
it
on
for
him
during
his
illness
and
that
everything
had
gone
on
as
well
as
if
he
had
acted
for
himself
although
miss
trevannion
had
not
expressed
a
wish
that
i
should
call
she
had
sent
humphrey
for
my
brother
philip
to
let
us
know
the
dangerous
state
in
which
her
father
was
and
after
that
philip
called
every
day
and
was
the
bearer
of
messages
to
me
as
her
father
recovered
she
told
philip
that
he
had
expressed
himself
very
strongly
as
to
his
conduct
towards
me
and
had
acknowledged
that
i
was
right
in
my
scruples
and
that
he
was
astonished
that
he
had
not
viewed
privateering
in
the
same
light
that
i
did
that
he
felt
very
grateful
for
my
considerate
and
kind
conduct
in
conducting
the
business
during
his
illness
and
that
as
soon
as
he
was
well
enough
he
would
call
upon
me
to
beg
my
pardon
for
his
conduct
towards
me
miss
trevannion
also
told
him
that
her
father
had
said
that
he
considered
his
illness
a
judgment
upon
him
and
a
warning
to
open
his
eyes
to
his
sacrifice
of
principle
to
the
desire
of
gain
and
that
he
received
it
accordingly
with
humility
and
thankfulness
that
it
was
his
intention
to
offer
the
privateer
vessels
to
government
and
if
they
did
not
hire
them
he
should
dispose
of
them
in
some
other
way
this
was
very
agreeable
intelligence
and
was
the
source
of
much
conversation
between
captain
levee
and
me
about
a
fortnight
afterwards
mr
trevannion
who
was
still
weak
sent
me
a
billet
in
which
he
said
that
he
was
afraid
that
his
anxiety
to
see
me
and
his
being
still
confined
to
his
room
rather
retarded
his
recovery
and
begged
as
a
favour
that
i
would
accept
his
acknowledgment
in
writing
and
come
to
see
him
that
i
consented
to
do
and
repaired
to
his
house
accordingly
i
found
him
in
his
room
sitting
in
his
and
he
had
evidently
suffered
much
mr
elrington
said
he
i
trust
to
your
excellent
nature
to
accept
my
apologies
for
the
very
unjust
treatment
you
have
received
at
my
hands
i
am
ashamed
of
myself
and
i
can
say
no
more
i
beg
mr
trevannion
that
you
will
say
no
more
i
accept
the
return
of
your
friendship
with
pleasure
replied
i
i
am
sorry
that
you
have
been
so
i
am
not
replied
he
it
is
good
for
us
to
be
chastised
at
times
my
sickness
has
opened
my
eyes
and
made
me
i
trust
a
better
man
may
i
ask
a
favour
of
you
most
certainly
sir
replied
i
it
is
that
you
will
execute
a
commission
for
me
which
is
to
go
to
london
on
my
account
see
the
government
people
who
control
the
naval
affairs
and
offer
the
arrow
as
a
hired
vessel
you
know
all
her
qualifies
so
well
and
have
kept
her
accounts
so
long
that
you
will
be
able
to
furnish
them
with
all
necessary
information
i
should
wish
captain
levee
to
go
with
you
and
if
you
possibly
can
make
it
a
condition
that
he
is
taken
into
the
king
service
and
appointed
the
captain
of
her
i
will
do
so
with
pleasure
replied
i
one
more
favour
i
have
to
beg
mr
elrington
when
i
so
foolishly
quarrelled
with
you
you
left
a
bag
of
money
to
which
you
were
fully
entitled
from
your
good
services
upon
the
table
in
the
inner
room
i
trust
now
that
you
will
not
mortify
me
by
refusing
it
or
i
shall
think
that
you
have
not
really
forgiven
me
i
bowed
assent
i
thank
you
mr
elrington
thank
you
very
much
now
i
shall
soon
get
well
perhaps
you
will
have
the
kindness
to
come
and
see
me
again
i
feel
rather
overcome
at
present
remember
me
kindly
to
philip
for
said
mr
trevannion
holding
out
his
emaciated
hand
god
bless
you
i
took
his
hand
and
quitted
the
room
shutting
the
door
softly
mr
trevannion
was
quite
alone
when
i
was
with
him
humphrey
the
porter
had
shown
me
to
the
room
anxious
as
i
was
to
see
miss
trevannion
i
did
not
venture
into
the
but
passed
the
door
and
went
when
i
was
going
out
of
the
humphrey
followed
me
and
said
miss
trevannion
wished
to
see
me
i
went
back
again
with
a
beating
heart
a
sensation
i
had
not
felt
before
when
about
to
go
into
her
presence
she
was
standing
by
the
table
mr
elrington
said
she
as
i
bowed
upon
entering
i
did
not
think
that
you
could
carry
your
resentment
against
me
so
far
as
to
leave
the
house
without
asking
to
see
me
but
if
you
do
not
wish
to
see
me
is
a
duty
i
owe
to
myself
to
wish
to
see
you
if
only
for
a
moment
that
i
may
beg
your
pardon
for
my
conduct
towards
you
when
we
last
parted
i
have
suffered
much
since
that
mr
elrington
do
not
make
me
suffer
more
by
continuing
your
resentment
recollect
i
am
but
a
weak
woman
and
must
not
be
judged
so
severely
as
one
of
your
own
sex
i
have
nothing
to
pardon
that
i
am
aware
of
miss
trevannion
replied
i
i
did
not
intrude
upon
you
just
now
because
being
no
longer
an
inmate
of
the
house
and
not
having
parted
with
you
in
complete
amity
i
thought
it
would
be
presumptuous
in
me
so
to
do
you
are
very
generous
mr
elrington
replied
she
now
take
my
hand
and
i
promise
never
to
be
so
hasty
again
i
took
the
proffered
hand
and
raised
it
respectfully
to
my
lips
i
had
never
done
so
before
but
miss
trevannion
showed
no
signs
of
displeasure
or
attempted
to
withdraw
it
do
you
think
my
father
looks
very
ill
mr
elrington
said
she
from
his
appearance
i
think
that
he
must
have
suffered
much
i
am
most
thankful
that
you
have
come
to
see
him
mr
elrington
you
have
no
idea
how
his
mind
was
troubled
and
how
he
longed
to
be
reconciled
to
you
i
trust
he
has
made
his
peace
i
have
always
had
too
much
respect
for
your
father
and
gratitude
for
his
kindness
to
me
to
have
made
that
a
work
of
difficulty
you
rejoice
me
much
make
me
very
happy
mr
elrington
replied
miss
trevannion
as
the
tears
dropped
fast
from
her
eyes
you
must
excuse
me
said
she
i
have
become
very
weak
and
nervous
during
my
illness
and
sitting
up
with
him
so
much
but
it
is
over
now
you
have
had
much
anxiety
i
see
miss
trevannion
you
are
pale
and
thin
to
what
you
were
did
my
father
but
i
have
no
right
to
ask
such
questions
you
would
inquire
miss
trevannion
whether
anything
was
said
as
to
future
arrangements
miss
trevannion
made
a
sign
of
assent
i
have
promised
to
execute
a
commission
for
him
and
am
going
to
london
accompanied
by
captain
levee
to
get
rid
of
those
wretched
privateers
is
it
not
yes
it
is
and
i
am
to
come
to
arrange
further
but
i
think
you
want
to
return
to
your
father
room
so
i
will
now
take
my
leave
you
are
considerate
mr
elrington
i
did
want
to
go
but
before
i
go
i
have
some
property
of
yours
to
place
in
your
hands
i
bowed
thinking
that
she
referred
to
the
ring
which
i
perceived
on
her
finger
and
was
annoyed
that
she
was
in
such
haste
to
return
it
but
on
the
contrary
she
went
to
the
buffet
and
brought
out
the
bag
of
gold
jacobuses
which
she
laid
on
the
table
you
are
very
proud
mr
elrington
not
to
take
what
was
fairly
your
due
said
miss
trevannion
smiling
it
is
much
more
than
i
have
ever
earned
replied
i
but
your
father
made
me
promise
not
to
refuse
it
a
second
time
and
of
course
i
shall
now
take
it
my
heart
was
much
lightened
when
i
found
that
it
was
the
gold
and
not
the
ring
then
mr
elrington
i
shall
see
you
of
course
miss
trevannion
then
left
the
room
and
hastened
to
her
father
and
i
went
home
to
my
lodgings
i
narrated
the
substance
of
what
had
passed
between
mr
trevannion
and
me
to
captain
levee
and
philip
and
also
that
i
had
been
kindly
received
by
miss
trevannion
well
i
like
the
reconciliation
and
arrangement
very
much
said
captain
levee
and
as
you
have
such
a
bag
of
gold
and
i
have
not
fifty
guineas
in
the
world
you
shall
stand
treat
in
london
elrington
that
i
will
with
pleasure
it
will
only
be
discharging
an
old
debt
levee
philip
shall
go
with
us
but
said
captain
levee
do
you
not
think
they
will
recognise
their
and
be
cautious
of
a
jacobite
they
may
remember
the
name
said
i
but
my
person
was
seen
but
by
few
i
do
however
think
it
would
be
advisable
as
i
shall
have
to
sign
papers
to
take
another
i
think
so
too
replied
captain
levee
what
shall
we
call
you
let
me
see
i
have
a
good
name
i
had
a
relative
of
the
name
of
musgrave
i
think
i
will
borrow
his
name
what
say
you
philip
will
you
be
for
the
future
philip
musgrave
yes
brother
with
all
my
heart
the
name
appears
to
fit
me
better
than
that
of
elrington
thus
madam
did
i
resume
my
real
name
without
any
suspicion
on
the
part
of
captain
levee
but
i
could
not
well
sign
government
papers
with
an
assumed
one
on
the
following
day
i
called
upon
mr
trevannion
who
received
me
with
great
affection
and
it
was
arranged
that
i
should
set
off
in
three
days
which
time
would
be
required
for
preparation
and
to
make
the
necessary
purchases
to
supply
funds
for
the
journey
mr
trevannion
gave
me
another
bag
of
jacobuses
of
the
same
amount
as
the
former
saying
that
he
wished
us
to
appear
bravely
when
we
arrived
in
london
and
that
he
should
require
no
account
of
the
expenditure
only
that
if
the
contents
of
the
bag
were
not
sufficient
he
would
supply
more
this
was
nothing
more
but
an
excuse
on
his
part
to
be
generous
for
one
quarter
of
the
money
would
have
been
sufficient
for
all
needful
expenses
i
told
him
that
i
had
taken
the
name
of
musgrave
as
that
of
elrington
might
be
remembered
to
the
injury
of
the
proposal
and
he
said
that
it
was
well
thought
of
by
me
miss
trevannion
had
entered
the
room
when
i
mentioned
that
to
her
father
and
afterwards
had
quitted
it
after
i
had
taken
leave
of
mr
trevannion
i
went
down
to
the
where
i
found
his
daughter
waiting
for
me
we
had
much
friendly
discourse
and
at
one
time
she
said
i
heard
you
say
that
you
had
taken
the
name
of
musgrave
for
your
intended
journey
do
you
intend
to
retain
that
name
when
you
return
why
should
i
replied
i
because
replied
she
perhaps
it
is
your
real
name
excuse
a
curiosity
but
is
not
that
the
fact
miss
trevannion
replied
i
my
real
name
must
at
present
remain
a
secret
that
is
to
say
it
will
no
longer
be
a
secret
if
intrusted
to
me
i
thank
you
sir
for
the
compliment
i
do
not
intend
to
imply
that
miss
trevannion
i
fully
believe
that
you
can
keep
a
secret
if
you
fully
believe
so
you
might
then
reply
to
my
question
the
more
so
as
i
now
pledge
myself
to
keep
your
secret
most
faithfully
then
miss
trevannion
my
real
name
is
musgrave
replied
i
i
thank
you
for
your
confidence
mr
musgrave
which
shall
not
be
misplaced
i
might
now
follow
up
my
inquiries
as
to
why
you
changed
your
name
with
many
other
queries
but
i
am
too
discreet
for
that
the
time
may
come
when
i
shall
know
all
but
i
am
content
with
your
proof
of
confidence
and
thank
you
for
it
miss
trevannion
never
was
so
lively
and
communicative
with
me
before
as
she
was
this
morning
there
was
a
friendliness
without
any
of
her
usual
reserve
and
i
left
her
more
full
of
admiration
and
devotion
than
ever
in
three
days
more
our
preparations
were
made
and
taking
leave
of
miss
trevannion
and
her
father
who
was
recovering
and
had
admitted
company
to
his
room
we
set
off
on
horseback
as
we
had
done
before
and
attended
by
the
same
two
men
of
captain
levee
who
had
served
us
on
a
former
journey
to
london
we
had
no
adventure
whatever
on
this
journey
which
could
be
worth
narrating
and
i
shall
therefore
say
that
we
arrived
in
good
health
and
spirits
and
took
up
our
abode
at
once
at
our
former
instead
of
going
to
the
inn
we
were
welcomed
by
the
hostess
who
had
her
house
almost
empty
the
following
day
i
made
inquiries
and
in
consequence
went
to
the
navy
office
and
requesting
to
see
one
of
the
head
clerks
informed
him
of
the
occasion
of
my
coming
up
to
london
he
was
very
civil
and
replied
that
the
government
were
in
want
of
vessels
and
he
had
no
doubt
but
they
would
have
the
arrow
as
she
was
as
a
strong
privateer
i
then
inquired
whether
they
thought
it
likely
that
captain
levee
might
be
taken
into
the
service
stating
what
an
excellent
crew
the
arrow
had
and
that
they
would
not
remain
in
her
unless
they
were
commanded
by
him
in
whom
they
had
great
confidence
the
clerk
replied
that
it
might
be
done
certainly
but
added
he
sir
you
can
not
expect
people
to
do
such
kind
offices
without
they
are
rewarded
i
perfectly
understood
him
and
replied
that
of
course
i
did
not
expect
it
but
i
was
so
ignorant
as
to
what
ought
to
be
done
that
i
begged
that
he
would
give
me
his
advice
for
which
i
should
be
most
grateful
well
well
you
understand
me
mr
musgrave
and
that
is
sufficient
i
will
be
plain
with
you
it
will
cost
guineas
to
obtain
what
you
want
for
captain
levee
and
of
that
money
i
shall
not
receive
a
doit
i
shall
be
most
happy
to
give
that
sum
and
half
as
much
more
to
obtain
my
wish
sir
and
shall
feel
much
obliged
to
you
in
the
bargain
and
while
i
am
negotiating
i
may
as
well
state
that
i
have
a
brother
who
sails
with
captain
levee
who
is
most
anxious
to
be
with
him
and
sail
as
his
lieutenant
that
will
cost
another
fifty
guineas
mr
musgrave
i
am
most
willing
replied
i
well
we
must
first
get
the
vessel
hired
into
the
service
you
have
your
tonnage
and
equipment
all
on
paper
everything
that
is
requisite
and
moreover
every
cruise
she
has
made
the
actions
she
has
fought
and
the
prizes
she
has
taken
under
the
command
of
captain
levee
and
with
the
crew
now
on
board
furnish
all
these
documents
mr
musgrave
and
leave
it
to
me
i
am
to
understand
that
you
perfectly
agree
to
the
terms
i
have
proposed
perfectly
sir
and
if
you
please
i
will
sign
a
memorandum
to
that
effect
no
no
replied
he
we
never
put
such
things
down
on
paper
it
is
an
affair
of
honour
and
good
faith
you
say
your
money
is
all
ready
at
a
minute
warning
that
is
sufficient
mr
musgrave
i
will
now
wish
you
good
morning
send
me
the
documents
i
have
them
in
my
pocket
sir
better
still
then
the
affair
may
be
arranged
this
afternoon
and
you
may
call
at
about
two
in
the
afternoon
and
you
may
as
well
bring
the
money
with
you
as
you
can
but
take
it
away
again
if
everything
is
not
to
your
satisfaction
i
returned
to
the
lodgings
quite
delighted
with
the
prospect
of
such
a
fortunate
issue
to
my
mission
and
was
in
good
time
for
dinner
i
did
not
tell
captain
levee
or
philip
of
what
had
passed
but
merely
that
i
considered
that
there
was
a
good
chance
of
success
and
that
i
was
to
call
on
the
following
day
that
night
we
went
to
the
theatre
and
saw
a
play
performed
written
by
shakespeare
in
the
time
of
queen
elizabeth
and
called
the
merry
wives
of
windsor
we
were
much
pleased
with
the
character
of
a
fat
knight
full
of
humour
the
next
day
at
the
time
appointed
i
called
upon
the
head
clerk
who
told
me
that
everything
was
arranged
according
to
my
wishes
that
the
hiring
of
the
vessel
was
according
to
her
tonnage
and
he
considered
that
the
price
offered
by
the
government
was
fair
and
liberal
so
did
i
and
immediately
accepted
it
he
then
drew
from
his
desk
the
articles
of
agreement
between
the
government
and
the
owner
of
the
vessel
and
at
the
same
time
the
warrants
for
captain
levee
and
philip
to
act
as
commander
and
lieutenant
now
mr
musgrave
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
sign
the
first
paper
and
fulfil
the
other
portion
of
our
agreement
i
immediately
pulled
out
the
bag
of
money
which
i
had
brought
with
me
and
after
counting
it
over
the
clerk
gave
me
his
pen
to
sign
the
document
and
handed
to
me
the
warrants
for
philip
and
captain
levee
you
have
behaved
liberally
in
this
affair
mr
musgrave
said
the
gentleman
as
he
locked
up
the
bag
of
money
in
his
desk
if
at
any
time
i
can
be
of
use
to
you
you
may
command
me
i
thank
you
sir
replied
i
i
may
have
to
ask
you
to
exert
your
influence
in
behalf
of
my
brother
that
he
may
obtain
the
command
of
one
of
the
king
ships
and
if
you
can
help
me
i
shall
be
most
grateful
depend
upon
it
i
will
replied
he
and
i
beg
you
will
use
no
ceremony
on
making
the
application
he
then
shook
hands
with
me
and
i
went
home
dinner
was
over
when
i
came
back
but
the
hostess
had
put
away
some
victuals
for
me
and
while
i
was
eating
them
i
gave
them
an
account
of
my
success
handing
their
warrants
to
captain
levee
and
philip
they
could
hardly
credit
me
even
when
the
documents
were
in
their
hands
but
pledging
them
to
secrecy
i
told
them
by
what
means
i
had
been
so
successful
whereupon
they
thanked
me
and
we
then
went
out
to
procure
the
uniforms
suitable
to
their
respective
ranks
and
this
occupied
us
till
the
evening
when
we
agreed
to
go
to
the
cockpit
and
see
the
fights
between
the
various
animals
with
which
philip
particularly
was
much
delighted
as
we
had
nothing
to
detain
us
in
london
and
it
was
necessary
that
the
arrow
should
immediately
run
round
to
the
nore
we
determined
as
the
uniforms
were
to
be
ready
on
the
following
day
that
the
day
after
that
we
would
return
to
liverpool
chapter
fifteen
we
return
to
liverpool
i
have
an
interview
with
miss
trevannion
plutus
interferes
with
cupid
and
i
sail
again
for
the
coast
of
africa
we
set
off
and
arrived
at
liverpool
without
accident
late
on
the
sixth
night
when
we
repaired
to
our
usual
lodgings
the
next
day
i
called
to
tell
mr
trevannion
that
i
had
returned
and
was
informed
by
humphrey
that
he
was
quite
strong
again
and
very
anxious
to
see
me
although
he
had
no
idea
that
i
should
return
so
soon
humphrey
went
up
to
announce
my
arrival
and
mr
trevannion
admitted
me
immediately
although
he
was
not
yet
out
of
bed
i
fear
that
you
have
not
been
successful
said
he
as
he
took
my
hand
on
the
contrary
sir
i
have
succeeded
in
everything
and
i
then
gave
him
an
account
of
what
had
happened
well
replied
he
i
am
glad
of
it
and
recollect
i
must
be
at
the
expense
as
without
you
had
incurred
it
the
schooner
would
not
in
all
probability
have
been
hired
and
now
i
want
to
consult
with
you
about
something
else
here
is
a
letter
from
captain
irving
of
the
amy
brought
home
by
the
chester
lass
these
were
two
vessels
employed
on
the
gold
coast
which
belonged
to
mr
trevannion
read
it
said
mr
trevannion
and
give
me
your
opinion
i
did
so
captain
irving
stated
that
he
had
pushed
the
two
vessels
up
a
small
river
on
the
coast
which
he
had
not
known
of
before
and
had
fallen
in
with
a
black
ruler
who
had
never
yet
treated
with
the
english
but
only
with
the
spaniards
for
slaves
that
his
english
commodities
were
quite
new
to
the
natives
and
that
in
consequence
he
had
made
a
most
fortunate
traffic
with
them
and
had
loaded
a
vessel
with
ivory
wax
and
to
the
amount
of
pounds
and
that
he
had
sent
the
chester
lass
remaining
himself
to
continue
the
barter
before
it
was
known
to
the
other
ships
on
the
coast
which
it
would
soon
be
he
continued
that
he
had
not
sufficient
of
the
articles
which
were
most
valued
by
the
natives
and
requested
that
mr
trevannion
would
immediately
despatch
another
vessel
with
various
goods
enumerated
and
that
then
he
should
be
able
to
fill
his
own
vessel
as
well
as
the
one
that
he
had
despatched
home
that
the
river
was
in
such
a
latitude
and
the
mouth
difficult
to
discover
that
he
sent
a
little
sketch
of
the
coast
which
would
facilitate
the
discovery
but
that
no
time
was
to
be
lost
as
the
sickly
season
was
coming
on
and
it
was
very
unhealthy
at
that
time
as
i
folded
up
the
letter
mr
trevannion
said
now
here
is
an
invoice
of
the
whole
cargo
sent
home
by
the
chester
lass
i
reckon
it
worth
about
pounds
i
looked
over
the
invoice
and
agreed
with
mr
trevannion
that
it
was
well
worth
that
if
not
more
this
is
most
important
you
will
acknowledge
musgrave
said
mr
trevannion
but
before
i
go
any
further
i
trust
that
now
the
only
difficulty
is
got
over
you
will
not
refuse
to
be
my
partner
the
only
difference
i
intend
to
make
is
that
i
now
offer
you
instead
of
silence
gives
consent
continued
mr
trevannion
as
i
did
not
immediately
reply
i
was
so
astonished
at
your
munificent
offer
sir
that
i
could
not
well
speak
then
it
agreed
so
say
no
more
about
it
said
mr
trevannion
taking
me
by
the
hand
and
pressing
it
warmly
and
now
to
business
my
idea
is
to
send
out
the
being
so
fast
a
sailer
of
course
as
a
privateer
she
has
done
her
work
and
as
the
government
wish
the
complement
of
the
arrow
to
be
increased
i
think
we
can
not
do
better
than
to
fill
her
up
with
some
of
the
men
leaving
about
on
board
of
her
and
sending
her
out
as
soon
as
possible
to
the
coast
with
the
articles
which
captain
irving
requests
i
agree
with
you
sir
that
it
will
be
the
best
plan
but
whom
to
send
is
the
difficulty
said
mr
trevannion
captain
paul
of
the
chester
lass
is
very
ill
and
not
likely
to
be
out
of
bed
for
some
time
and
even
if
he
were
well
i
have
no
opinion
of
him
in
an
affair
of
this
moment
if
as
captain
irving
says
he
can
fill
the
amy
her
cargo
will
be
worth
three
times
that
of
the
chester
lass
but
of
course
the
destination
of
the
must
be
a
secret
and
i
do
not
know
whom
to
intrust
her
to
we
require
some
one
in
whom
we
can
put
confidence
i
agree
with
you
sir
replied
i
and
if
you
have
no
objection
i
think
that
the
best
plan
will
be
for
me
to
go
myself
i
shall
be
back
again
in
ten
weeks
at
the
furthest
well
as
you
will
now
have
a
strong
interest
in
it
i
really
think
so
too
in
fact
i
do
know
whom
else
we
can
trust
i
agree
with
you
sir
and
i
will
go
myself
and
i
think
the
sooner
the
better
but
i
do
not
know
whether
we
can
obtain
all
the
goods
requisite
immediately
we
can
have
them
in
five
or
six
days
replied
mr
trevannion
i
sent
humphrey
out
to
make
inquiry
at
all
events
i
must
look
to
them
myself
and
there
are
many
other
things
to
manage
so
i
had
better
wish
you
a
good
morning
now
mr
trevannion
and
in
the
evening
i
will
call
again
and
let
you
know
what
i
have
done
do
so
said
he
and
i
then
took
my
leave
i
certainly
was
very
much
astonished
as
well
as
much
pleased
at
mr
trevannion
liberality
relative
to
the
partnership
and
i
could
now
look
forward
to
competency
in
a
few
years
at
the
furthest
certainly
if
mr
trevannion
had
been
hasty
in
his
conduct
towards
me
he
had
made
most
noble
reparation
i
first
returned
to
the
lodgings
and
told
captain
levee
and
philip
what
had
passed
they
immediately
proposed
that
we
should
all
go
together
on
board
the
that
i
might
make
my
arrangements
and
that
they
might
persuade
some
of
the
men
to
join
the
arrow
i
first
picked
out
the
men
i
wished
to
sail
with
me
and
then
they
talked
over
the
rest
who
that
evening
went
on
shore
for
their
wages
and
the
next
morning
joined
the
arrow
as
captain
levee
was
anxious
to
get
round
to
the
nore
the
day
after
the
men
joined
the
arrow
sailed
which
i
was
not
sorry
for
as
it
left
me
more
at
leisure
to
expedite
my
own
affairs
philip
promised
to
be
my
correspondent
and
i
bade
them
both
farewell
with
regret
i
called
in
the
evening
as
i
had
promised
upon
mr
trevannion
and
he
then
gave
me
the
deed
of
partnership
signed
and
dated
the
day
when
he
first
made
the
offer
and
we
had
quarrelled
but
i
did
not
see
miss
trevannion
much
to
my
regret
her
father
said
that
she
was
ailing
the
business
i
had
to
transact
and
fitting
out
the
so
completely
occupied
me
that
it
was
now
three
days
that
i
had
been
at
liverpool
without
having
seen
her
and
i
was
much
annoyed
at
it
as
i
had
called
every
day
my
feelings
towards
her
were
now
stronger
than
before
she
was
never
out
of
my
thoughts
and
i
hardly
know
how
it
was
that
i
transacted
business
as
i
did
this
evening
i
was
determined
if
possible
that
i
would
see
her
and
find
out
why
she
avoided
me
as
it
appeared
to
me
that
she
did
when
i
called
therefore
i
did
not
ask
to
see
her
father
but
told
humphrey
to
find
out
where
miss
trevannion
was
and
say
that
i
requested
to
speak
with
her
humphrey
returned
and
said
that
she
was
in
the
to
which
i
instantly
repaired
i
am
fearful
that
i
have
given
you
some
unintentional
cause
of
displeasure
miss
trevannion
said
i
as
i
entered
for
you
have
appeared
to
avoid
me
since
my
return
indeed
mr
musgrave
i
have
not
replied
she
i
was
most
anxious
to
see
you
and
have
thought
it
very
unpolite
i
may
add
unkind
on
your
part
not
to
have
come
to
me
i
have
been
in
the
house
every
day
and
sometimes
twice
a
day
with
your
father
miss
trevannion
and
have
never
met
you
once
i
inquired
for
you
and
your
father
told
me
you
were
unwell
whereas
humphrey
had
but
five
minutes
before
told
me
that
you
were
well
and
in
good
spirits
humphrey
told
the
truth
and
so
did
my
father
i
was
in
good
health
and
spirits
and
in
five
minutes
afterwards
i
was
ill
and
unhappy
i
trust
i
was
no
party
to
it
miss
trevannion
you
were
a
party
to
it
but
not
the
great
offender
who
was
my
father
he
had
told
me
that
upon
your
return
he
had
installed
you
as
his
partner
and
had
done
you
the
justice
you
had
deserved
and
then
he
told
me
that
you
were
going
out
to
the
coast
of
africa
in
the
it
is
very
true
miss
trevannion
but
where
is
the
offence
the
offence
is
this
my
father
no
sooner
does
you
justice
than
he
wants
more
ivory
and
having
more
than
enough
already
but
i
told
him
it
was
as
bad
as
privateering
for
in
either
case
he
sends
people
out
to
sacrifice
their
lives
that
he
may
gain
more
money
i
have
no
patience
with
this
foolish
pursuit
of
wealth
after
all
your
father
kindness
to
me
miss
trevannion
i
could
do
no
less
than
accept
the
offer
you
would
have
been
more
wise
and
more
just
to
yourself
to
have
refused
it
mr
musgrave
i
read
the
letters
to
my
father
when
they
arrived
and
you
know
what
captain
irving
says
about
the
unhealthiness
of
the
climate
you
have
been
my
father
best
friend
and
he
should
not
have
treated
you
thus
i
never
did
value
life
miss
trevannion
but
really
the
kind
interest
you
have
expressed
on
this
occasion
makes
me
feel
as
if
my
poor
life
was
of
some
value
to
one
who
has
been
such
a
football
of
fortune
as
i
have
been
and
who
has
hardly
known
a
kind
feeling
towards
him
ever
expressed
it
is
a
gratification
that
i
really
appreciate
and
coming
from
one
whom
i
respect
and
esteem
more
than
any
other
person
in
the
world
it
quite
overpowers
me
indeed
miss
trevannion
i
am
truly
grateful
i
was
correct
when
i
said
that
it
overpowered
me
for
it
did
completely
and
i
was
so
oppressed
by
my
feelings
that
i
reeled
to
a
chair
and
covered
up
my
face
with
my
hands
what
would
i
have
given
to
have
dared
to
state
what
i
felt
you
are
ill
mr
musgrave
said
miss
trevannion
coming
to
me
can
i
offer
you
anything
i
made
no
reply
i
could
not
speak
mr
musgrave
said
miss
trevannion
taking
my
hand
you
frighten
me
what
is
the
matter
shall
i
call
humphrey
i
felt
her
hand
tremble
in
mine
and
uncertain
what
to
think
i
came
to
the
resolution
to
make
the
avowal
miss
trevannion
said
i
after
a
pause
and
rising
from
my
chair
i
feel
that
this
internal
conflict
is
too
great
for
me
and
if
it
last
it
must
kill
me
i
give
you
my
honour
that
i
have
for
months
tried
everything
in
my
power
to
curb
my
desires
and
to
persuade
myself
of
my
folly
and
rash
ambition
but
i
can
not
do
so
any
longer
it
were
better
that
i
knew
my
fate
at
once
even
if
my
sentence
should
be
my
death
you
will
ridicule
my
folly
be
surprised
at
my
presumption
and
in
all
probability
spurn
me
for
the
avowal
but
make
it
i
must
miss
trevannion
i
have
dared
to
love
you
i
have
but
one
excuse
to
offer
which
is
that
i
have
been
more
than
a
year
in
your
company
and
it
is
impossible
for
any
one
not
to
love
one
so
pure
so
beautiful
and
so
good
i
would
have
postponed
this
avowal
till
i
was
able
to
resume
my
position
in
society
by
the
means
which
industry
might
have
afforded
me
but
my
departure
upon
this
business
and
the
kind
of
presentiment
which
i
have
that
i
may
not
see
you
again
has
forced
it
from
me
in
a
few
days
i
leave
you
be
gentle
with
me
for
my
involuntary
offence
pity
me
while
you
condemn
and
i
will
return
no
more
miss
trevannion
did
not
reply
she
breathed
quick
and
stood
motionless
i
gathered
courage
i
looked
in
her
face
there
was
no
displeasure
i
approached
her
she
was
half
fainting
and
put
her
hand
upon
my
shoulder
to
steady
herself
i
put
my
arm
round
her
waist
and
led
her
to
the
sofa
and
knelt
at
her
feet
watching
every
change
in
her
beautiful
countenance
i
took
her
hand
and
pressed
it
to
my
lips
by
degrees
i
became
more
bold
and
got
by
her
side
and
pressed
her
to
my
heart
she
burst
into
tears
and
wept
with
her
head
on
my
bosom
do
not
be
angry
with
me
said
i
after
a
time
do
i
appear
as
if
i
was
angry
with
you
replied
she
raising
her
head
oh
no
but
i
can
not
believe
my
happiness
to
be
real
it
must
be
a
dream
what
is
life
but
a
dream
replied
she
mournfully
oh
the
coast
of
africa
how
i
dread
it
and
so
i
confess
did
i
from
that
moment
i
had
a
presentiment
as
i
had
told
her
that
something
would
go
wrong
and
i
could
not
get
over
the
feeling
i
shall
no
longer
dwell
upon
what
took
place
on
that
delightful
evening
madam
suffice
to
say
that
miss
trevannion
and
i
were
mutually
pledged
and
after
an
exchange
of
thought
and
feeling
we
parted
and
when
we
did
part
i
pressed
those
dear
lips
to
mine
i
went
home
reeling
with
excitement
and
hastened
to
bed
that
i
might
have
unrestrained
freedom
of
thought
i
enacted
the
scene
of
the
evening
over
and
over
again
recalled
each
motion
each
look
every
word
which
had
passed
and
defying
fever
and
presentiment
of
evil
imagined
also
our
happy
meeting
to
part
no
more
it
was
long
before
i
could
compose
myself
to
sleep
and
when
i
did
i
need
not
say
who
it
was
that
occupied
my
dreams
i
called
as
soon
as
i
could
venture
so
to
do
on
the
following
day
and
had
a
long
interview
with
my
dear
amy
before
i
went
up
to
her
father
i
tried
to
soothe
her
anxiety
upon
my
approaching
voyage
and
to
persuade
her
that
there
was
little
or
no
danger
to
be
apprehended
in
so
short
a
stay
willingly
would
i
have
given
it
up
but
mr
trevannion
had
so
set
his
mind
upon
it
and
i
had
by
my
consent
rendered
it
so
impossible
for
him
to
find
a
substitute
in
time
that
i
could
not
do
so
and
i
persuaded
miss
trevannion
that
i
was
right
in
acting
to
my
promise
line
question
that
came
forward
was
whether
we
should
make
known
our
engagement
to
her
father
at
once
and
this
was
decided
in
the
negative
much
as
he
liked
me
he
was
not
yet
prepared
to
receive
me
so
suddenly
as
a
and
amy
was
of
opinion
that
the
communication
had
better
be
postponed
to
this
of
course
i
gave
a
willing
assent
i
was
satisfied
with
the
knowledge
of
her
affection
which
i
felt
would
never
change
as
i
was
talking
with
her
father
after
my
interview
with
amy
he
said
really
elrington
or
musgrave
i
hardly
know
which
to
call
you
musgrave
is
my
real
name
sir
replied
i
musgrave
musgrave
where
did
i
know
a
musgrave
we
are
from
the
north
replied
i
well
said
he
i
was
going
to
say
that
i
really
wish
i
could
find
some
one
else
to
take
your
place
in
this
voyage
for
i
do
not
much
like
your
going
do
my
dear
father
said
miss
trevannion
who
was
standing
by
him
hey
miss
amy
what
have
you
to
do
with
it
i
should
like
to
know
and
how
can
it
concern
you
whether
mr
musgrave
goes
or
not
i
said
so
sir
because
i
know
how
you
will
feel
his
loss
for
so
long
a
period
you
know
how
you
did
feel
his
loss
before
and
i
do
not
wish
to
see
you
working
so
hard
as
you
will
have
to
do
it
without
his
assistance
well
that
kindly
thought
amy
at
all
events
but
still
i
fear
that
mr
musgrave
must
go
and
i
must
work
by
myself
till
he
comes
back
so
it
no
use
saying
any
more
about
it
amy
sighed
and
made
no
reply
on
the
third
day
after
this
interview
everything
was
ready
and
on
the
following
morning
i
was
to
sail
mr
trevannion
had
so
many
directions
to
give
and
kept
me
so
wholly
with
him
that
i
could
hardly
find
time
to
speak
to
his
daughter
however
it
was
agreed
that
as
i
was
to
sail
at
daylight
that
she
would
see
me
after
her
father
had
gone
to
bed
our
meeting
took
place
need
i
say
that
it
was
a
tender
one
we
renewed
our
vows
over
and
over
again
and
it
was
not
till
past
midnight
that
i
tore
myself
away
old
humphrey
looked
very
knowingly
at
me
when
he
let
me
out
of
the
i
slipped
a
guinea
in
his
hand
and
wished
him
i
hastened
on
board
of
the
and
desiring
to
be
called
before
daylight
went
down
into
the
cabin
there
i
remained
sitting
at
the
table
and
thinking
of
amy
so
long
that
when
the
mate
came
down
to
wake
me
he
found
that
i
was
still
sitting
there
having
never
been
to
bed
during
the
whole
of
the
night
i
started
from
my
reverie
and
hastened
on
deck
to
get
the
schooner
under
weigh
it
was
soon
done
although
we
were
comparatively
speaking
there
was
a
fine
breeze
and
lightened
as
she
now
was
the
little
vessel
flew
through
the
water
liverpool
was
soon
out
of
sight
and
we
were
dashing
down
the
irish
channel
she
sails
well
now
said
i
to
the
second
mate
a
very
clever
man
and
much
hotter
educated
than
most
seamen
for
he
could
navigate
as
well
as
being
a
seaman
yes
sir
replied
olivarez
she
walks
fast
she
is
not
too
deep
now
replied
he
what
a
slaver
she
would
make
this
man
was
not
an
englishman
but
a
brazilian
portuguese
by
birth
although
he
had
long
been
out
of
his
country
having
set
her
course
i
went
down
below
that
i
might
indulge
in
my
more
at
my
ease
the
wind
increased
to
a
gale
but
as
it
was
from
the
northward
and
bore
us
to
our
destination
it
was
welcomed
we
soon
crossed
the
bay
of
biscay
and
were
in
more
genial
latitudes
and
after
a
rapid
run
of
about
four
weeks
i
found
myself
nearly
in
the
latitude
given
to
us
of
the
river
where
the
amy
was
at
anchor
i
then
hauled
in
for
the
shore
which
was
very
low
and
required
being
approached
with
caution
we
saw
some
towering
at
sunset
and
then
we
the
next
day
we
again
stood
in
and
having
ascertained
our
exact
latitude
at
noon
we
found
ourselves
about
four
miles
to
the
northward
of
the
river
mouth
we
shaped
a
course
and
in
two
hours
i
made
out
the
marks
given
for
our
guidance
in
the
rough
sketch
of
captain
irving
and
thus
satisfied
that
i
was
right
ran
directly
for
the
mouth
of
the
river
captain
irving
was
correct
in
saying
it
was
difficult
for
it
was
not
until
we
were
within
a
mile
that
we
could
find
any
opening
but
at
last
we
did
and
at
the
same
time
perceived
the
masts
of
two
vessels
at
some
distance
up
the
river
we
stood
in
and
found
that
there
was
no
bar
at
the
river
mouth
which
was
a
very
unusual
circumstance
on
this
coast
the
soundings
were
gradual
and
in
an
hour
afterwards
we
anchored
between
the
amy
and
a
fine
schooner
under
british
colours
captain
irving
recognised
the
and
immediately
came
on
board
after
the
usual
salutations
he
told
me
that
his
vessel
was
but
that
he
waited
for
the
articles
he
had
sent
for
to
enable
him
to
complete
his
cargo
i
told
him
that
i
had
them
on
board
and
he
should
have
them
as
soon
as
he
sent
his
boats
he
stated
that
no
vessels
except
those
engaged
in
the
had
ever
come
into
this
river
and
that
they
only
brought
the
cloth
and
other
articles
usual
in
the
trade
but
that
his
assorted
cargo
had
astonished
the
people
and
they
were
wild
to
possess
things
which
they
had
never
before
seen
they
had
offered
slaves
in
quantities
but
finding
that
he
would
not
take
them
in
exchange
they
had
now
brought
down
ivory
and
he
told
me
how
glad
he
was
that
i
had
come
as
the
river
was
very
sickly
and
was
becoming
more
and
more
so
every
day
that
out
of
twelve
men
he
had
already
four
down
with
fever
i
inquired
of
him
what
that
vessel
was
on
the
other
side
of
us
he
replied
it
was
a
liverpool
and
that
the
captain
appeared
to
be
a
very
good
sort
of
man
that
he
never
indulged
in
liquor
nor
was
given
to
profane
language
a
few
minutes
afterwards
the
captain
of
the
slaver
came
on
board
to
pay
his
respects
and
i
asked
him
down
in
the
cabin
and
gave
him
beer
and
cheese
the
two
greatest
luxuries
in
those
climes
he
appeared
as
captain
irving
stated
a
very
quiet
serious
person
which
i
was
rather
surprised
at
when
we
repaired
on
deck
i
observed
as
the
vessel
was
close
to
us
that
there
were
two
very
large
dogs
on
board
who
at
the
sight
of
the
captain
bayed
furiously
he
told
me
that
they
were
cuba
bloodhounds
and
that
he
never
went
on
shore
without
them
as
they
were
the
most
faithful
and
courageous
animals
and
he
considered
that
he
was
safer
with
them
than
with
half
a
dozen
armed
men
shortly
afterwards
captain
irving
and
he
both
took
leave
as
there
were
still
some
hours
of
daylight
captain
irving
sent
his
boats
for
the
goods
and
after
that
as
the
evening
fell
i
went
down
below
as
captain
irving
requested
i
would
do
and
by
no
means
remain
on
deck
after
as
it
was
extremely
unhealthy
on
the
following
day
captain
irving
went
on
shore
with
his
goods
and
trafficked
most
favourably
indeed
as
we
afterwards
found
out
he
had
procured
in
exchange
more
ivory
than
his
vessel
would
hold
besides
much
the
day
after
i
went
on
shore
with
captain
irving
to
call
upon
the
king
as
he
called
himself
he
was
seated
in
front
of
a
hut
made
of
palmetto
leaves
with
a
lace
coat
on
but
no
other
garment
whatever
so
that
he
made
a
curious
appearance
after
a
little
conversation
i
went
away
and
hearing
that
the
slaver
was
taking
her
cargo
on
board
about
a
hundred
yards
further
up
i
walked
in
that
direction
the
slaves
were
brought
down
in
about
twenty
at
a
time
all
of
them
fastened
by
the
neck
to
a
long
bamboo
pole
which
confined
them
all
together
one
string
of
them
had
been
sent
down
and
put
into
the
boat
and
another
was
standing
ready
for
embarkation
when
as
i
cast
my
eyes
over
them
and
commiserated
their
misery
i
observed
a
female
whom
i
thought
i
had
seen
before
i
looked
again
and
behold
it
was
whyna
the
princess
who
had
been
so
kind
to
me
in
my
captivity
i
went
up
to
her
and
touched
her
on
the
shoulder
she
turned
round
as
well
as
the
lashing
to
the
pole
would
permit
her
and
on
seeing
me
gave
a
faint
scream
without
ceremony
i
took
out
my
knife
and
released
her
and
led
her
away
she
fell
down
at
my
feet
and
kissed
them
the
black
man
who
had
charge
of
the
delivery
of
the
slaves
was
very
angry
and
ran
up
to
me
brandishing
his
long
stick
but
the
captain
of
the
schooner
who
was
on
shore
and
who
had
witnessed
what
i
had
done
saluted
him
with
a
kick
in
the
stomach
which
made
him
quiet
enough
in
few
words
i
told
the
captain
of
the
slaver
that
i
was
once
in
captivity
and
this
woman
had
befriended
me
requesting
him
to
name
his
price
and
i
would
willingly
pay
it
it
not
worth
mentioning
sir
replied
he
women
are
as
cheap
as
dirt
take
her
and
welcome
not
so
replied
i
i
must
pay
for
her
ransom
well
then
sir
said
he
i
am
in
great
want
of
a
telescope
you
have
one
on
board
will
you
let
me
have
it
most
certainly
replied
i
and
many
thanks
into
the
bargain
i
lifted
up
the
poor
creature
who
was
badly
emaciated
and
weak
and
led
her
to
the
boat
of
the
amy
and
put
her
in
captain
irving
came
down
and
we
returned
on
board
it
was
with
great
difficulty
that
after
i
had
given
the
poor
creature
some
refreshment
which
she
was
really
in
need
of
i
could
recollect
sufficient
of
her
language
to
make
myself
understood
by
her
but
by
degrees
words
came
to
my
memory
and
as
she
spoke
i
recovered
more
as
well
as
i
could
make
her
out
the
warriors
had
risen
against
the
king
on
account
of
his
barbarity
and
had
cut
him
to
pieces
and
that
all
his
wives
and
servants
had
been
sold
as
slaves
i
promised
her
that
she
should
not
be
a
slave
but
should
come
to
my
country
and
be
taken
care
of
she
kissed
my
hands
and
as
she
smiled
her
thanks
she
reminded
me
of
the
whyna
of
former
times
i
did
not
however
think
it
advisable
that
she
should
come
on
board
of
the
schooner
and
i
requested
captain
irving
to
take
charge
of
her
and
let
her
want
for
nothing
telling
him
that
i
intended
that
she
should
go
home
in
his
vessel
he
willingly
consented
and
i
hailed
the
schooner
for
a
boat
and
went
on
deck
whyna
followed
but
i
told
her
i
was
obliged
to
go
on
board
of
the
schooner
and
that
she
had
better
go
and
lie
down
as
she
probably
thought
that
the
amy
was
my
vessel
and
that
i
was
going
away
on
a
visit
she
complied
with
my
request
and
went
down
with
captain
irving
who
led
her
into
a
which
was
not
occupied
as
soon
as
i
arrived
on
board
the
schooner
i
sent
the
telescope
which
the
captain
of
the
slaver
had
begged
for
whyna
had
said
to
me
i
shall
be
your
slave
now
evidently
expecting
that
she
was
to
remain
with
me
but
that
i
could
not
consent
to
miss
trevannion
had
heard
from
me
my
adventures
when
in
captivity
and
i
would
not
on
that
account
allow
whyna
to
be
in
the
same
vessel
with
me
the
next
day
captain
irving
came
on
board
to
tell
me
that
he
had
two
more
men
down
with
the
fever
and
that
he
wished
i
could
give
them
some
assistance
in
getting
his
cargo
on
board
which
i
did
and
before
night
the
amy
was
loaded
up
to
the
hatchways
and
there
still
remained
a
considerable
number
of
elephants
teeth
on
shore
in
the
hut
where
he
received
them
i
therefore
determined
as
his
crew
were
evidently
sickening
fast
that
he
should
sail
immediately
and
that
i
would
take
the
remainder
of
the
ivory
on
board
of
the
schooner
and
follow
him
giving
him
a
rendezvous
to
wait
at
until
i
joined
him
that
we
might
proceed
home
in
company
that
night
three
of
my
men
were
ill
i
was
on
board
of
the
amy
and
had
been
talking
with
whyna
who
wanted
to
know
why
i
did
not
sleep
on
board
of
the
vessel
i
told
her
that
i
could
not
but
that
we
were
to
go
to
england
directly
and
that
i
was
living
on
board
of
the
schooner
captain
irving
weighed
at
daybreak
and
in
an
hour
was
out
of
the
river
and
as
i
was
as
anxious
to
be
clear
of
such
an
unhealthy
spot
i
manned
my
boats
and
went
on
shore
for
the
ivory
that
was
left
i
found
that
it
would
take
the
whole
of
the
day
to
embark
it
as
we
had
to
go
two
miles
further
up
the
river
than
the
depth
of
water
would
permit
the
vessel
to
do
for
the
ivory
was
in
a
hut
close
to
the
king
house
i
had
sent
off
four
and
it
being
then
noon
i
went
off
with
the
fifth
myself
that
i
might
get
my
dinner
leaving
the
second
mate
to
attend
on
shore
and
taking
with
me
the
first
mate
who
messed
in
the
cabin
as
we
were
in
the
middle
of
the
stream
the
boat
struck
against
a
stump
of
a
tree
as
we
supposed
and
knocked
so
large
a
hole
in
the
bow
that
she
began
to
fill
i
immediately
ordered
the
men
to
pull
for
the
nearest
point
which
was
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
that
we
might
ground
the
boat
to
prevent
her
sinking
the
first
mate
who
was
a
very
active
man
finding
that
the
teeth
prevented
his
reaching
the
bow
of
the
boat
and
stuffing
into
it
some
oakum
which
he
had
found
in
the
stern
sheets
sounded
with
the
and
finding
that
there
was
not
more
than
three
feet
of
water
where
we
were
pulling
jumped
over
the
bows
to
push
the
oakum
into
the
hole
but
the
poor
fellow
had
not
been
a
few
seconds
in
the
water
when
he
gave
a
shriek
and
we
perceived
that
a
large
shark
had
snapped
him
in
two
this
was
a
sad
mishap
and
the
men
terrified
pulled
as
hard
as
they
could
while
two
of
them
baled
out
the
boat
to
gain
the
shore
for
we
knew
what
fate
awaited
us
if
we
sunk
in
the
river
with
great
exertion
we
succeeded
running
her
up
among
the
canes
which
grew
on
that
side
of
the
river
so
thick
that
it
was
difficult
to
force
your
way
through
them
we
landed
up
to
our
knees
in
mud
and
throwing
out
the
ivory
we
found
that
a
whole
plank
was
rent
out
and
that
it
was
impossible
to
repair
our
boat
and
we
were
hidden
by
the
canes
from
those
who
could
have
assisted
us
had
they
known
that
we
required
their
assistance
and
we
had
no
possible
means
of
communication
at
last
i
thought
that
if
i
could
force
my
way
through
the
canes
to
the
point
down
the
river
i
could
hail
and
make
signals
for
assistance
and
desiring
the
men
to
remain
by
the
boat
i
set
of
upon
my
expedition
at
first
i
got
on
pretty
well
as
there
were
little
paths
through
the
canes
made
as
i
imagined
by
the
natives
and
although
i
was
often
up
to
my
knees
in
thick
black
mud
i
continued
to
get
on
pretty
fast
but
at
last
the
canes
grew
so
thick
that
i
could
hardly
force
my
way
through
them
and
it
was
a
work
of
excessive
labour
still
i
persevered
expecting
each
second
that
i
should
arrive
at
the
banks
of
the
river
and
be
rewarded
for
my
fatigue
but
the
more
i
laboured
the
worse
it
appeared
to
be
and
at
last
i
became
worn
out
with
fatigue
and
quite
bewildered
i
then
tried
to
find
my
way
back
and
was
equally
unsuccessful
and
i
sat
down
with
anything
but
pleasant
thoughts
in
my
mind
i
calculated
that
i
had
been
two
hours
in
making
this
attempt
and
was
now
quite
puzzled
how
to
proceed
i
bitterly
lamented
my
rashness
now
that
it
was
too
late
having
reposed
a
little
i
resumed
my
toil
and
was
again
after
an
hour
exertion
compelled
from
fatigues
to
sit
down
in
the
deep
black
mud
another
respite
from
toil
and
another
hour
or
more
of
exertion
and
i
gave
myself
up
for
lost
the
day
was
evidently
fast
closing
in
the
light
overhead
was
not
near
so
bright
as
it
had
been
and
i
knew
that
a
night
passed
in
the
miasma
of
the
cane
was
death
at
last
it
became
darker
and
darker
there
could
not
be
an
hour
of
daylight
remaining
i
determined
upon
one
more
struggle
and
reeking
as
i
was
with
perspiration
and
faint
with
fatigue
i
rose
again
and
was
forcing
my
way
through
the
thickest
of
the
canes
when
i
heard
a
deep
growl
and
perceived
a
large
panther
not
twenty
yards
from
me
it
was
on
the
move
as
well
as
i
was
attempting
to
force
his
way
through
the
canes
so
as
to
come
to
me
i
retreated
from
him
as
fast
as
i
could
but
he
gained
slowly
on
me
and
my
strength
was
fast
exhausting
i
thought
i
heard
sounds
at
a
distance
and
they
became
more
and
more
distinct
but
what
they
were
my
fear
and
my
struggles
probably
prevented
me
from
making
out
my
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
fierce
animal
which
was
in
pursuit
of
me
and
i
now
thanked
god
that
the
canes
were
so
thick
and
impassable
still
the
animal
evidently
gained
ground
until
it
was
not
more
than
five
yards
from
me
dashing
and
springing
at
the
canes
and
tearing
them
aside
with
his
teeth
the
sounds
were
now
nearer
and
i
made
them
out
to
be
the
howling
of
other
animals
a
moment
pause
and
i
thought
it
was
the
baying
of
dogs
and
i
then
thought
that
i
must
have
arrived
close
to
where
the
schooner
was
and
that
i
heard
the
baying
of
the
bloodhounds
at
last
i
could
do
no
more
and
i
dropped
exhausted
and
almost
senseless
in
the
mud
i
recollect
hearing
the
crushing
of
the
canes
and
then
a
savage
roar
and
then
yells
and
growls
and
struggles
and
fierce
contentions
but
i
had
fainted
i
must
now
inform
the
reader
that
about
an
hour
after
i
had
left
the
boat
the
captain
of
the
slaver
was
pulling
up
the
river
and
was
hailed
by
our
men
in
our
perceiving
them
on
shore
on
that
side
of
the
river
and
that
they
were
in
distress
he
pulled
towards
them
and
they
told
him
what
had
happened
and
that
an
hour
previous
i
had
left
the
boat
to
force
my
way
through
the
and
they
had
heard
nothing
of
me
since
madness
cried
he
he
is
a
lost
man
stay
till
i
come
back
from
the
schooner
he
went
back
to
the
schooner
and
taking
two
of
his
crew
who
were
negroes
and
his
two
bloodhounds
into
the
boat
he
returned
immediately
and
as
soon
as
he
landed
he
put
the
bloodhounds
on
my
track
and
sent
the
negroes
on
with
them
they
had
followed
me
in
all
my
windings
for
it
appeared
that
i
had
travelled
in
every
direction
and
had
come
up
with
me
just
as
i
had
sunk
with
exhaustion
and
the
panther
was
so
close
upon
me
the
bloodhounds
had
attacked
the
panther
and
this
was
the
noise
which
sounded
in
my
ears
as
i
lay
stupified
and
at
the
mercy
of
the
wild
beast
the
panther
was
not
easily
although
eventually
overcome
and
the
black
men
coming
up
had
found
me
and
borne
me
in
a
state
of
insensibility
on
board
the
the
fever
had
come
on
me
and
it
was
not
till
three
weeks
afterwards
that
i
recovered
my
senses
when
i
learnt
what
i
have
now
told
the
reader
and
much
more
with
which
i
am
about
to
make
him
acquainted
when
i
recovered
my
senses
i
found
myself
in
the
cabin
of
the
for
some
hours
i
was
confused
and
wandering
but
i
rallied
from
time
to
time
till
i
could
at
last
recognise
the
beams
and
carlines
over
my
head
i
was
too
weak
to
move
and
i
continued
to
lie
on
my
back
till
i
again
fell
asleep
how
long
i
do
not
know
but
it
must
have
been
for
many
hours
and
then
when
i
awoke
i
found
myself
much
stronger
i
could
now
turn
on
my
bed
and
doing
so
i
perceived
a
young
man
of
the
name
of
ingram
by
my
side
in
a
doze
with
his
eyes
shut
i
called
him
in
a
faint
voice
and
he
started
up
i
have
been
very
ill
said
i
have
i
not
yes
sir
indeed
you
have
i
have
been
trying
to
recollect
all
about
it
but
i
can
not
as
yet
it
not
worth
remembering
sir
replied
he
do
you
wish
anything
to
drink
no
replied
i
then
you
had
better
go
to
sleep
again
i
can
not
do
that
i
feel
as
if
i
should
like
to
get
up
where
is
mr
thompson
i
must
see
him
mr
thompson
sir
replied
he
do
you
recollect
what
why
sir
he
was
bitten
in
two
by
a
shark
shark
this
was
the
required
and
my
memory
returned
yes
yes
i
recollect
now
all
all
i
recollect
the
panther
and
the
how
was
i
preserved
the
bloodhounds
killed
the
panther
and
you
were
brought
on
board
insensible
and
have
been
in
a
raging
fever
ever
since
it
must
be
so
replied
i
collecting
my
senses
after
a
few
moments
of
thought
it
must
be
so
how
long
have
i
been
ill
this
is
the
day
the
day
cried
i
is
it
possible
are
none
of
the
men
ill
no
sir
they
are
all
well
but
i
hear
the
water
against
the
bends
are
we
not
still
at
anchor
no
sir
the
second
mate
got
the
schooner
under
weigh
as
he
found
you
were
so
and
i
have
been
ill
days
why
we
must
be
near
home
we
expect
to
make
the
land
in
a
few
days
sir
replied
ingram
thank
heaven
for
all
its
mercies
said
i
i
never
expected
to
see
old
england
again
but
what
a
bad
smell
there
is
what
can
it
be
i
suppose
it
is
the
sir
replied
ingram
people
who
are
ill
and
weak
always
are
annoyed
by
it
but
i
think
sir
if
you
would
take
a
little
gruel
and
then
go
to
sleep
again
it
would
be
better
well
i
fear
i
am
not
very
strong
and
talking
so
much
has
done
me
no
good
i
think
i
could
take
a
little
gruel
then
sir
i
go
and
get
some
made
and
be
back
very
soon
do
ingram
and
tell
mr
olivarez
the
second
mate
that
i
would
speak
to
him
yes
i
will
replied
the
man
and
he
left
the
i
waited
some
time
listening
for
the
arrival
of
the
second
mate
and
then
i
thought
that
i
heard
odd
noises
in
the
hold
before
the
of
the
in
which
i
was
lying
but
i
was
still
very
weak
and
my
head
swam
after
a
time
ingram
came
down
with
the
gruel
into
which
he
put
some
sugar
and
a
spoonful
of
rum
to
flavour
it
as
he
said
he
offered
it
to
me
and
i
drank
it
all
for
i
had
an
appetite
but
whether
it
was
that
i
was
very
weak
or
the
rum
he
put
in
was
more
than
he
said
it
is
certain
that
i
had
hardly
given
him
back
the
basin
than
i
felt
so
drowsy
that
i
turned
away
from
him
and
was
soon
again
in
forgetfulness
this
ingram
was
a
young
man
who
had
been
apprenticed
to
an
apothecary
and
had
taken
to
the
sea
he
was
well
educated
and
a
very
merry
fellow
and
i
had
chosen
him
as
one
who
could
attend
upon
me
in
the
cabin
and
at
the
same
time
be
otherwise
useful
if
required
as
he
was
a
very
good
seaman
and
very
active
when
i
awoke
again
i
felt
convinced
that
i
must
have
slept
through
the
night
as
it
was
broad
daylight
as
before
but
ingram
was
not
by
my
bedside
there
was
no
bell
in
the
and
i
was
obliged
to
await
his
coming
i
felt
much
stronger
than
the
day
before
and
now
proposed
getting
out
of
bed
as
soon
as
ingram
should
come
down
into
the
cabin
i
now
remembered
that
the
second
mate
had
not
come
down
to
me
and
heard
noises
and
murmurings
in
the
hold
as
i
had
the
day
previous
which
surprised
me
and
i
became
more
anxious
for
the
return
of
ingram
at
last
he
came
and
i
told
him
that
i
had
been
awake
more
than
an
hour
how
do
you
feel
yourself
sir
said
he
quite
strong
i
should
like
to
get
up
and
dress
perhaps
i
may
be
able
to
get
on
deck
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
i
think
replied
he
that
you
had
better
wait
and
hear
what
i
have
to
tell
you
sir
i
would
not
tell
you
yesterday
because
i
thought
it
would
be
too
much
for
you
but
as
i
see
you
are
really
better
i
must
say
that
i
have
strange
things
to
tell
you
indeed
cried
i
with
surprise
strange
things
by
the
bye
why
did
not
olivarez
come
to
me
yesterday
i
will
explain
all
to
you
sir
if
you
will
lie
down
and
listen
to
what
i
have
to
say
and
take
the
news
quietly
very
well
ingram
i
will
do
so
now
pray
go
on
you
were
brought
on
board
in
a
state
of
fever
and
insensibility
by
the
captain
of
the
slaver
he
said
as
he
lifted
you
over
the
side
that
you
were
a
dead
man
we
all
thought
the
same
and
you
were
taken
down
into
the
cabin
with
that
persuasion
on
the
part
of
the
whole
crew
your
delirium
and
fever
increased
and
every
hour
it
was
expected
that
you
would
give
up
the
ghost
now
sir
two
days
afterwards
the
slaver
sailed
with
his
cargo
and
we
were
left
alone
in
the
river
olivarez
who
of
course
commanded
talked
to
the
men
he
said
that
you
were
as
good
as
dead
already
and
that
he
thought
that
this
was
a
fair
opportunity
for
their
making
money
he
proposed
that
the
ivory
still
on
shore
should
be
changed
for
slaves
which
he
said
the
negroes
would
gladly
do
and
that
we
should
run
with
our
cargo
to
the
brazils
he
said
that
it
would
be
useless
our
remaining
in
the
river
as
we
should
all
lose
our
lives
in
the
same
way
that
you
had
done
and
that
he
thought
as
commanding
the
schooner
he
knew
what
would
best
please
the
owner
who
had
long
employed
vessels
in
the
and
would
not
be
sorry
to
find
that
we
had
run
a
cargo
and
would
reward
them
all
liberally
that
this
would
be
an
excuse
to
leave
the
river
immediately
whereas
otherwise
they
would
have
to
wait
till
you
recovered
or
died
and
by
that
time
they
might
half
of
them
be
dead
themselves
do
you
understand
me
sir
yes
perfectly
go
on
ingram
well
sir
the
men
did
not
perceive
what
he
was
about
and
replied
that
so
long
as
they
left
the
river
they
did
not
care
how
soon
and
that
it
was
better
that
we
should
take
a
cargo
of
slaves
at
all
events
for
olivarez
was
in
command
now
and
they
should
do
as
he
ordered
them
i
made
no
reply
indeed
olivarez
never
put
the
question
to
me
well
sir
the
ivory
was
soon
exchanged
for
slaves
who
are
now
on
board
and
it
is
the
slaves
whom
you
have
smelt
and
complained
of
we
received
on
board
and
provisions
sufficient
with
what
we
had
and
having
taken
in
all
the
water
we
could
below
and
on
deck
we
made
sail
out
of
the
river
and
have
since
steered
for
the
brazils
but
olivarez
has
taken
a
most
unwarrantable
responsibility
said
i
and
one
that
he
shall
answer
for
stop
sir
replied
ingram
you
have
only
heard
the
first
part
of
the
story
when
we
had
been
three
days
at
sea
olivarez
who
had
been
talking
to
the
men
one
by
one
and
apart
called
them
together
and
said
it
was
an
opportunity
not
to
be
lost
that
they
had
possession
of
the
vessel
and
the
owner
would
never
have
a
clue
to
where
she
had
gone
and
that
now
was
the
time
to
take
possession
of
her
for
themselves
and
employ
her
in
the
on
their
own
account
that
sailing
so
fast
nothing
could
overhaul
her
or
board
her
and
therefore
they
were
free
from
danger
he
then
proposed
that
he
should
command
and
navigate
and
receive
of
the
profits
and
that
the
other
half
should
be
divided
among
the
crew
the
expense
of
the
provisions
etcetera
being
paid
out
of
it
previous
to
their
sharing
and
making
a
calculation
he
showed
them
that
every
voyage
would
be
worth
about
pounds
a
man
after
all
expenses
were
paid
the
crew
consented
at
once
to
the
terms
all
but
me
and
when
he
asked
me
my
answer
was
that
i
would
consent
to
nothing
while
you
were
yet
alive
i
said
that
because
i
was
afraid
that
they
would
murder
me
or
throw
me
overboard
go
on
ingram
go
on
and
let
me
hear
it
all
at
once
you
will
soon
be
freed
from
your
difficulty
said
olivarez
do
not
know
that
sir
i
replied
i
think
mr
musgrave
may
get
over
it
he
returned
then
so
much
the
worse
for
him
as
he
olivarez
said
this
the
whole
of
the
crew
to
do
them
justice
cried
out
that
there
should
be
no
murder
for
if
there
was
they
not
only
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
affair
but
would
make
it
known
at
the
first
port
to
which
they
came
that
you
had
always
been
a
kind
good
officer
and
were
too
brave
a
man
to
die
in
that
way
my
men
said
olivarez
never
had
an
idea
of
the
kind
and
i
promise
you
if
he
lives
through
it
there
shall
be
no
murder
i
will
put
him
on
shore
at
the
first
port
we
arrive
at
but
in
such
a
way
as
to
secure
our
safety
that
we
must
look
to
the
men
said
that
that
was
all
right
and
then
they
all
agreed
to
join
him
you
ingram
said
olivarez
do
you
say
i
said
before
i
replied
as
long
as
mr
musgrave
lives
i
will
come
to
no
agreement
whatever
said
olivarez
is
but
postponing
your
decision
i
know
that
you
will
join
us
so
now
my
lads
as
we
all
agreed
we
may
as
well
go
to
dinner
the
scoundrel
shall
pay
for
this
cried
i
hush
sir
hush
i
pray
say
nothing
but
wait
patiently
and
see
what
turns
up
we
are
not
yet
at
rio
and
when
we
are
we
may
be
able
to
do
something
but
everything
depends
upon
keeping
quiet
for
if
the
men
become
alarmed
they
may
be
persuaded
to
kill
you
to
save
themselves
that
is
very
true
ingram
replied
i
leave
me
now
for
half
an
hour
i
wish
to
be
alone
you
may
imagine
my
dear
madam
my
agitation
at
hearing
this
intelligence
i
who
had
thought
that
i
was
within
a
few
days
sail
of
liverpool
to
be
there
received
by
my
cherished
amy
to
find
myself
in
the
hands
of
pirates
and
close
to
the
brazils
with
a
cargo
of
slaves
which
they
or
rather
olivarez
had
taken
in
the
vessel
to
rio
that
he
might
not
be
discovered
for
he
might
have
found
a
better
mart
for
his
live
cargo
and
then
what
would
be
the
anxiety
of
amy
and
her
father
when
i
was
not
heard
of
it
would
be
supposed
that
the
schooner
was
upset
in
a
squall
and
all
hands
had
perished
excited
and
angry
as
i
was
i
felt
the
truth
of
what
ingram
said
and
that
it
was
necessary
to
be
quiet
perhaps
i
might
by
that
means
not
only
preserve
my
life
but
again
find
myself
in
my
own
country
when
ingram
returned
i
asked
him
if
olivarez
knew
that
i
was
better
and
had
recovered
my
reason
he
replied
that
he
did
but
that
he
had
told
him
i
was
so
weak
that
i
could
hardly
recover
that
is
well
said
i
keep
him
in
that
belief
as
long
as
you
can
he
now
offered
me
more
gruel
which
i
took
and
i
believe
that
he
put
an
opiate
in
it
for
shortly
after
i
had
taken
it
i
again
felt
drowsy
and
was
soon
fast
asleep
i
awoke
sooner
than
before
for
it
was
night
and
i
heard
the
voice
of
olivarez
on
deck
from
what
i
gathered
land
was
in
sight
and
i
heard
him
order
the
schooner
to
be
in
the
morning
ingram
came
down
in
the
cabin
bringing
me
some
breakfast
which
i
ate
heartily
for
i
was
recovering
fast
and
had
become
quite
ravenous
land
is
in
sight
said
i
yes
sir
it
is
but
we
are
many
miles
to
the
northward
of
rio
i
understand
for
olivarez
knows
the
coast
well
we
shall
not
be
in
if
we
are
i
feel
quite
strong
now
replied
i
and
i
want
to
get
up
do
so
sir
said
he
but
if
you
hear
any
one
coming
down
the
ladder
get
into
bed
again
with
ingram
assistance
i
dressed
myself
and
went
into
the
cabin
i
reeled
as
i
walked
but
as
soon
as
i
felt
the
cool
breeze
from
the
i
was
revived
and
in
an
hour
i
could
walk
quite
strong
have
you
heard
any
more
inquired
i
of
ingram
olivarez
asked
me
this
morning
how
you
were
i
replied
that
you
were
recovering
fast
well
said
he
will
share
his
fate
whatever
it
may
be
since
you
have
been
so
careful
of
him
and
have
put
us
in
such
a
dilemma
but
i
contrive
to
dispose
of
you
both
i
made
no
reply
sir
as
i
knew
that
would
only
irritate
him
you
did
right
ingram
a
few
days
will
decide
our
fate
i
do
not
think
that
he
dares
to
murder
us
nor
do
i
think
he
wishes
it
if
he
can
be
clear
of
us
with
safety
to
himself
replied
ingram
two
days
more
passed
away
and
then
ingram
told
me
that
we
were
a
few
miles
from
the
town
and
should
soon
be
at
anchor
go
softly
replied
i
and
tell
me
what
is
going
on
he
went
up
the
ladder
but
soon
came
down
again
saying
we
are
locked
in
sir
i
was
very
much
annoyed
at
this
but
it
could
not
be
helped
our
only
remedy
was
patience
but
i
must
confess
that
i
was
in
a
state
of
great
anxiety
we
heard
the
anchor
let
go
and
boats
came
on
board
after
which
all
was
silent
for
the
night
the
next
morning
we
heard
them
open
the
hatches
and
the
slaves
were
ordered
upon
deck
the
day
was
passed
in
landing
them
i
was
ravenously
hungry
and
asked
ingram
whether
they
intended
to
starve
us
he
went
up
the
ladder
to
call
for
victuals
when
he
found
on
the
upper
step
of
the
ladder
a
large
vessel
full
of
water
and
some
cooked
provisions
which
had
probably
been
put
there
during
the
night
there
was
enough
to
last
two
or
three
days
the
next
day
passed
and
no
one
came
near
us
and
i
had
some
thoughts
of
dropping
out
of
the
and
attempting
to
swim
on
shore
but
ingram
who
had
put
his
head
out
of
them
as
far
as
he
could
told
me
that
we
must
be
at
some
distance
from
the
shore
and
there
were
several
sharks
playing
round
the
stern
as
is
always
the
case
with
vessels
laden
with
slaves
the
next
morning
however
put
an
end
to
our
suspense
for
the
companion
was
unlocked
and
olivarez
accompanied
by
four
portuguese
came
down
into
the
cabin
he
spoke
to
them
in
portuguese
and
they
advanced
and
seizing
ingram
and
me
by
the
collar
led
us
up
the
ladder
i
would
have
expostulated
but
of
course
could
not
make
myself
understood
olivarez
however
said
resistance
is
useless
mr
musgrave
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
go
quietly
with
these
men
as
soon
as
the
schooner
has
sailed
you
will
be
released
well
replied
i
it
may
be
so
olivarez
but
mark
my
words
you
will
repent
this
and
i
shall
see
you
on
a
gibbet
i
trust
the
wood
is
not
yet
out
of
the
ground
replied
he
but
i
can
not
waste
any
more
words
with
you
he
then
spoke
to
the
portuguese
who
appeared
to
be
government
officers
of
some
kind
and
they
led
us
to
the
gangway
we
went
into
the
boat
and
they
pulled
us
to
the
shore
where
can
they
be
taking
us
ingram
said
i
heaven
knows
sir
but
we
shall
find
out
i
attempted
to
speak
to
the
officers
but
they
cried
which
word
i
fully
understood
to
mean
silence
and
finding
that
i
could
not
induce
them
to
hear
me
i
said
no
more
we
landed
at
a
jetty
and
were
then
led
through
the
streets
to
a
large
square
on
one
side
of
it
was
a
heavy
building
to
which
they
directed
their
steps
the
door
was
opened
for
us
and
we
were
led
in
a
paper
was
produced
by
our
conductors
and
was
apparently
copied
into
a
book
after
which
they
went
away
leaving
us
with
the
people
who
had
received
us
and
who
by
their
appearance
i
knew
to
be
gaolers
of
what
crime
am
i
accused
inquired
i
no
reply
was
given
but
two
of
the
subordinates
took
us
away
unlocked
a
massive
door
and
thrust
us
into
a
large
full
of
men
of
every
colour
well
said
i
as
the
door
closed
upon
us
we
are
in
gaol
at
all
events
but
the
question
now
is
shall
we
be
released
as
olivarez
had
stated
it
is
hard
to
say
replied
ingram
the
question
is
what
gaol
is
this
could
we
find
any
one
who
could
speak
english
we
might
discover
several
of
those
around
us
had
come
towards
us
to
examine
us
and
then
left
us
when
as
we
were
conversing
a
negro
came
up
and
hearing
what
we
said
addressed
us
in
english
massa
want
one
to
speak
english
i
speak
english
some
long
while
on
board
english
vessel
well
then
my
good
fellow
said
i
can
you
tell
us
what
this
gaol
is
and
what
prisoners
are
confined
here
for
yes
massa
everybody
know
that
suppose
he
live
at
rio
this
gaol
for
people
that
go
dig
diamonds
how
do
you
mean
mean
massa
people
sent
here
to
work
in
all
life
long
till
they
die
keep
here
till
hab
plenty
to
send
up
all
at
one
time
then
guard
take
them
up
the
country
and
they
go
dig
and
wash
for
diamond
suppose
you
find
very
big
diamond
you
go
free
suppose
not
den
you
die
there
merciful
heavens
cried
i
to
ingram
then
we
are
condemned
as
slaves
to
the
mines
yes
replied
ingram
with
a
sigh
well
it
better
than
working
in
the
at
all
events
we
shall
have
fresh
air
fresh
air
without
liberty
cried
i
clasping
my
hands
come
sir
courage
we
do
not
yet
know
our
fate
perhaps
we
may
as
olivarez
said
be
allowed
to
go
free
after
the
schooner
sails
i
shook
my
head
for
i
was
convinced
otherwise
chapter
sixteen
the
and
what
occurred
there
i
lose
my
friend
ingram
and
another
acquaintance
but
they
both
leave
me
valuable
legacies
after
remaining
in
the
court
about
two
hours
it
being
then
near
to
nightfall
the
gaolers
came
out
into
the
yard
and
we
were
all
driven
into
a
large
apartment
the
walls
of
which
were
of
such
solid
materials
and
the
floor
of
large
as
to
prevent
any
possibility
of
escape
i
was
never
in
such
a
scene
of
filth
and
wretchedness
there
was
not
a
spot
where
one
could
be
driven
without
being
defiled
in
some
way
or
another
and
so
many
human
beings
one
half
of
whom
were
negroes
being
crowded
into
so
small
a
space
with
only
one
barred
window
so
high
up
as
only
to
serve
as
a
ventilator
created
an
atmosphere
worse
than
any
hold
i
leaned
with
my
back
against
the
wall
and
i
must
say
never
was
so
miserable
in
my
life
i
thought
of
amy
and
my
sanguine
hopes
and
anticipations
of
happiness
now
all
wrecked
i
thought
of
captain
levee
and
my
brother
philip
careering
over
the
seas
free
as
the
wind
i
thought
of
poor
whyna
and
the
distress
she
must
feel
at
finding
i
did
not
rejoin
her
i
planned
a
hundred
schemes
to
make
known
my
situation
but
every
scheme
as
soon
as
i
weighed
it
i
found
was
hopeless
still
weak
from
previous
disease
i
felt
as
if
i
should
be
suffocated
if
i
remained
long
in
this
pestiferous
abode
and
i
wept
like
a
child
daylight
came
at
last
and
soon
afterwards
the
door
was
opened
we
were
admitted
into
the
yard
and
all
hastened
to
the
large
tub
of
water
which
was
soon
emptied
the
fighting
and
scrambling
to
obtain
first
possession
was
really
revolting
an
hour
afterwards
some
coarse
provisions
were
served
out
and
then
we
learnt
to
our
great
delight
that
we
were
immediately
to
set
out
for
the
mines
it
would
be
thought
that
this
could
be
no
great
cause
for
exultation
we
were
about
to
go
to
pass
the
rest
of
our
lives
in
bondage
but
all
misery
is
comparative
and
sooner
than
have
remained
another
night
in
that
dreadful
hole
i
would
have
welcomed
any
change
about
an
hour
afterwards
a
guard
of
soldiers
came
in
we
were
all
handcuffed
to
a
long
chain
at
about
two
feet
apart
one
on
each
side
so
that
we
walked
in
pairs
and
as
soon
as
the
first
chain
was
full
and
i
was
handcuffed
to
it
we
were
ordered
out
into
the
square
to
wait
for
the
others
my
superior
dress
and
appearance
as
an
englishman
excited
much
curiosity
people
pointed
to
me
and
made
remarks
but
i
had
no
opportunity
of
communicating
with
any
of
the
authorities
nor
would
it
have
been
of
any
use
if
i
had
had
we
remained
there
more
than
an
hour
as
the
other
chains
of
prisoners
came
out
one
by
one
we
were
five
chains
in
all
about
forty
on
a
chain
we
were
then
ordered
to
move
on
walking
between
a
guard
of
about
twenty
or
thirty
soldiers
who
marched
on
each
side
of
us
with
their
muskets
and
bayonets
fixed
about
three
yards
from
each
other
in
another
hour
we
were
clear
of
the
town
and
threading
our
way
through
a
lane
bounded
on
each
side
by
prickly
pears
and
other
shrubs
there
was
no
want
of
merriment
among
the
party
they
talked
and
laughed
with
one
another
and
the
soldiers
who
guarded
them
and
appeared
to
care
little
for
their
fate
as
for
me
i
was
with
the
disgrace
and
the
villainous
manner
in
which
i
had
been
thus
sacrificed
my
heart
was
full
of
bitterness
and
i
could
gladly
have
lain
down
and
died
had
i
not
been
still
buoyed
up
with
some
faint
hope
that
i
should
have
an
opportunity
of
making
my
position
known
and
obtain
my
release
i
will
pass
over
the
journey
as
one
day
was
but
the
forerunner
of
the
other
we
halted
at
noon
and
were
supplied
with
fruit
and
maize
but
we
were
never
unchained
day
or
night
in
a
short
time
i
was
like
all
the
rest
covered
with
vermin
and
disgusting
to
myself
it
was
i
think
between
four
and
five
weeks
before
we
arrived
at
our
destination
which
was
in
the
district
of
tejuco
and
the
locality
of
the
was
called
the
sierra
de
espinhaco
this
sierra
or
mountain
was
a
ridge
of
inaccessible
precipices
on
each
side
of
a
narrow
valley
traversed
by
a
small
river
called
the
tequetinhonha
and
in
this
valley
and
in
the
bed
of
the
river
were
the
diamonds
found
for
which
we
were
condemned
to
toil
for
the
remainder
of
our
days
as
we
entered
the
ravine
i
perceived
how
impossible
it
would
be
to
escape
even
if
a
person
could
find
his
way
back
after
having
succeeded
in
his
escape
for
many
miles
the
road
was
a
narrow
path
cut
on
the
side
of
the
mountain
a
yawning
precipice
below
and
inaccessible
rocks
above
and
this
narrow
way
was
at
every
two
miles
blocked
up
by
a
built
upon
it
and
through
the
portcullis
of
which
it
would
be
necessary
to
force
a
way
and
here
we
were
thousands
of
miles
away
from
civilised
life
in
the
heart
of
a
country
uninhabited
except
by
occasional
bands
of
indians
at
last
we
filed
through
the
last
of
the
and
found
ourselves
in
a
wider
part
of
the
ravine
which
was
crowded
with
buildings
of
various
descriptions
we
were
led
up
to
the
director
house
and
our
names
persons
and
descriptions
were
taken
down
by
a
clerk
when
my
turn
came
and
i
was
asked
in
portuguese
who
i
was
i
shook
my
head
and
replied
ingles
an
interpreter
was
called
and
i
then
stated
my
name
and
begged
the
director
would
hear
what
i
had
to
say
he
shook
his
head
and
after
they
had
taken
my
description
desired
me
to
go
away
why
did
you
not
explain
for
me
said
i
to
the
interpreter
because
he
wo
hear
what
you
have
to
say
if
he
would
every
man
on
the
chain
would
attempt
to
prove
that
he
was
sent
here
by
mistake
you
may
find
an
opportunity
to
speak
to
him
that
is
after
you
have
learnt
portuguese
and
have
been
here
a
year
or
two
but
it
will
do
no
good
during
the
whole
of
the
journey
i
had
been
separated
from
ingram
and
now
for
the
first
time
since
we
left
prison
i
had
an
opportunity
of
shaking
him
by
the
hand
i
need
not
say
how
glad
i
was
to
meet
again
my
companion
in
misfortune
and
our
only
fear
was
now
that
we
should
be
again
separated
but
such
was
not
the
case
there
were
regular
lodgings
or
barracks
for
the
slaves
which
were
certainly
not
bad
but
as
all
escape
was
considered
impossible
any
one
who
chose
to
raise
a
little
hut
for
himself
out
of
the
bushes
which
grew
on
the
rocks
was
permitted
so
to
do
the
hours
of
work
were
regular
we
were
allotted
out
in
gangs
which
took
up
a
certain
square
of
the
river
or
river
side
we
worked
from
daylight
till
near
dusk
with
only
an
hour
allowed
for
repose
in
the
heat
of
the
day
there
was
a
superintendent
over
each
gang
of
twenty
who
watched
them
and
made
them
work
these
superintendents
were
controlled
by
inspectors
who
had
the
charge
of
four
or
five
gangs
and
who
brought
unto
the
director
the
produce
of
the
day
toil
the
work
was
simple
the
sand
and
alluvial
soil
were
thrown
into
troughs
with
small
sieve
bottoms
out
of
which
escaped
all
the
smaller
matter
when
it
was
washed
with
the
water
from
the
river
the
stones
and
larger
particles
were
then
carefully
examined
and
any
diamonds
found
were
taken
out
and
delivered
to
the
superintendents
who
then
made
them
over
to
the
inspectors
when
they
came
round
the
inspectors
carried
them
to
their
houses
for
they
had
houses
from
government
and
in
the
evening
delivered
every
diamond
found
to
the
director
after
a
short
time
i
found
that
the
office
of
superintendent
and
also
of
inspector
was
open
to
any
of
the
slaves
who
conducted
themselves
well
and
that
the
whole
of
those
now
employed
in
the
offices
were
slaves
for
life
as
well
as
ourselves
what
puzzled
me
was
how
so
many
people
for
in
all
we
amounted
to
seven
hundred
or
more
were
to
be
found
in
food
but
i
afterwards
discovered
that
the
government
had
farms
and
herds
of
cattle
at
a
few
miles
distance
cultivated
by
slaves
and
indians
expressly
for
the
purpose
our
rations
were
scanty
but
we
were
permitted
to
cultivate
as
well
as
we
could
any
spot
we
could
find
on
the
arid
side
of
the
mountain
as
a
garden
and
some
of
them
who
had
been
there
for
many
years
had
in
course
of
time
produced
a
good
soil
and
reared
plenty
of
vegetables
to
my
surprise
i
found
at
least
twenty
englishmen
among
the
whole
mass
of
slaves
and
one
or
two
of
them
were
inspectors
and
several
of
them
superintendents
saying
much
in
favour
of
my
countrymen
their
conversation
and
their
advice
tended
much
to
soothe
the
hardships
of
my
captivity
but
i
found
from
them
that
any
hopes
of
ever
leaving
the
mines
were
useless
and
that
our
bones
must
all
be
laid
by
the
side
of
the
mountain
of
course
ingram
and
i
were
inseparable
we
worked
in
the
same
gang
and
we
very
soon
built
a
hut
for
ourselves
and
ingram
who
was
a
young
man
set
to
work
to
make
a
garden
he
moved
heavy
stones
on
the
sides
of
the
mountain
and
scraped
up
all
the
mould
he
could
find
sometimes
he
would
get
his
handkerchief
full
but
not
often
but
as
he
said
every
little
helped
he
killed
lizards
for
manure
and
with
them
and
leaves
he
made
a
little
which
he
watered
to
assist
putrefaction
everything
that
would
assist
he
carefully
collected
and
by
degrees
he
had
sufficient
for
a
patch
of
four
or
five
yards
square
this
he
planted
and
with
the
refuse
made
more
manure
and
in
the
course
of
a
few
months
by
incessant
activity
and
assisted
by
me
he
had
a
very
tolerable
patch
of
ground
covered
with
this
manure
and
the
alluvial
soil
washed
out
by
the
mixed
up
together
we
then
obtained
seeds
and
grew
vegetables
like
the
rest
and
this
proved
a
great
increase
to
our
comforts
that
is
our
bodily
wants
but
my
mind
was
far
away
amy
trevannion
was
never
out
of
my
thoughts
and
i
fell
into
a
deep
melancholy
i
worked
hard
at
my
vocation
and
was
fortunate
enough
to
find
some
good
diamonds
long
before
i
had
been
a
year
at
the
mines
having
acquired
the
portuguese
language
i
was
soon
after
raised
to
the
office
of
superintendent
i
now
no
longer
worked
but
overlooked
others
with
a
cane
in
my
hand
to
administer
punishment
to
those
who
neglected
their
business
i
can
not
say
that
i
liked
the
change
i
was
not
so
miserable
when
i
was
employed
but
i
did
my
duty
with
diligence
ingram
was
in
my
gang
and
another
englishman
an
old
man
i
should
think
not
less
than
seventy
years
old
he
told
me
that
he
belonged
to
a
merchant
vessel
and
in
a
drunken
brawl
a
portuguese
had
been
killed
he
and
two
others
had
been
condemned
to
the
mines
but
the
others
were
dead
long
ago
about
a
month
after
my
elevation
this
old
man
who
was
very
feeble
and
whom
i
treated
with
great
kindness
on
account
of
his
age
exacting
no
more
than
i
thought
he
could
well
perform
fell
sick
i
reported
him
as
being
really
ill
and
ingram
who
was
by
no
means
a
bad
doctor
told
me
that
he
would
die
a
few
hours
before
his
death
he
sent
for
me
to
his
hut
and
after
thanking
me
for
my
kindness
to
him
he
said
that
he
knew
he
was
dying
and
that
he
wished
to
leave
me
all
his
property
which
the
slaves
are
permitted
to
do
that
is
he
left
me
his
garden
which
was
the
best
on
the
sierra
his
hut
which
also
was
a
very
good
one
and
then
putting
his
hand
under
the
leaves
which
formed
his
bed
he
pulled
out
a
tattered
thumbed
book
which
he
told
me
was
a
bible
at
first
i
read
said
he
to
pass
away
time
in
this
melancholy
place
but
of
late
i
have
read
it
i
hope
to
a
better
purpose
i
thanked
the
poor
man
for
his
present
and
wished
him
a
few
hours
afterwards
he
was
dead
and
ingram
and
i
buried
him
by
the
side
of
the
mountain
shortly
afterwards
our
inspector
died
and
to
my
astonishment
i
was
put
into
his
place
i
could
not
imagine
why
i
was
thus
so
fortunate
in
being
promoted
but
i
afterwards
found
out
that
although
i
had
never
but
casually
seen
her
i
was
indebted
for
my
good
fortune
to
a
fancy
which
the
director
eldest
daughter
for
he
had
his
family
with
him
had
taken
for
me
this
was
singular
for
i
had
never
spoken
to
her
and
what
is
more
strange
i
never
did
speak
to
her
nor
did
she
ever
attempt
to
speak
to
me
so
that
it
was
wholly
disinterested
on
her
part
i
had
now
still
less
to
do
and
was
in
constant
communication
with
the
director
and
one
day
stated
to
him
how
it
was
that
i
had
been
brought
there
he
told
me
that
he
believed
me
but
could
not
help
me
and
after
that
the
subject
was
never
again
mentioned
between
us
having
little
to
do
i
now
took
up
the
bible
given
me
by
the
old
englishman
as
i
had
time
to
read
it
which
i
had
not
before
when
i
was
employed
the
whole
day
but
now
i
had
a
convenient
cottage
as
i
may
call
it
of
my
own
i
and
plenty
of
leisure
and
retirement
i
studied
the
bible
carefully
and
found
much
comfort
in
it
not
that
i
was
content
with
my
lot
that
i
never
could
be
while
i
was
separated
from
amy
but
still
i
found
much
consolation
and
i
became
to
a
certain
degree
resigned
i
thought
of
my
former
life
with
disgust
and
this
second
reading
of
the
bible
for
the
reader
may
recollect
that
the
first
took
place
when
i
was
first
confined
in
the
tower
was
certainly
of
great
advantage
to
me
i
had
more
time
to
dwell
upon
it
more
time
for
reflection
and
and
every
day
i
reaped
more
advantage
and
became
more
worthy
of
the
name
of
christian
i
now
prayed
fervently
and
i
think
my
prayers
were
heard
as
you
my
dear
madam
will
also
think
as
i
continue
my
narrative
about
three
months
after
i
had
been
appointed
an
inspector
ingram
was
taken
at
first
he
complained
of
disordered
bowels
but
in
a
few
days
inflammation
came
on
which
ended
in
mortification
he
was
in
great
agony
until
the
mortification
took
place
when
he
obtained
comparative
relief
my
dear
mr
musgrave
he
said
as
i
was
at
his
bedside
in
a
few
hours
i
shall
have
escaped
from
the
mines
and
be
no
more
in
bondage
i
shall
follow
the
poor
old
englishman
who
left
you
his
executor
i
am
about
to
do
the
same
i
shall
now
make
my
will
verbally
as
we
have
no
writing
materials
here
and
leave
you
all
i
possess
why
are
you
not
more
serious
ingram
i
said
at
such
a
moment
as
this
i
am
most
serious
he
replied
i
know
that
in
a
few
hours
i
shall
be
no
more
and
i
trust
in
the
mercy
of
him
who
died
for
kings
and
for
slaves
but
musgrave
i
have
a
secret
to
tell
you
do
you
recollect
the
story
in
the
fairy
tales
of
the
little
white
cat
whose
head
was
obliged
to
be
cut
off
and
who
then
turned
into
the
most
beautiful
princess
in
the
world
well
my
secret
is
something
like
hers
i
thought
by
his
continuing
in
this
strain
that
his
head
was
wandering
i
was
about
to
speak
to
him
when
he
continued
do
you
know
what
has
occasioned
my
death
i
will
tell
you
the
secret
i
was
washing
for
diamonds
when
i
found
one
of
a
size
which
astonished
me
i
knew
it
was
of
great
value
and
i
did
not
choose
that
the
king
of
portugal
should
receive
such
a
benefit
from
my
hands
i
put
it
into
my
mouth
to
secrete
it
hardly
knowing
what
i
should
do
afterwards
but
i
was
thinking
how
i
should
act
when
one
of
the
superintendents
passing
that
crabbed
old
portuguese
belonging
to
the
next
gang
and
seeing
me
idle
and
in
deep
thought
he
struck
me
with
his
cane
such
a
smart
rap
on
the
shoulders
that
he
not
only
made
me
jump
out
of
my
reverie
but
the
diamond
went
down
my
throat
i
sure
if
i
had
tried
to
swallow
it
i
could
not
have
done
so
but
the
shock
forced
it
down
well
this
has
occasioned
my
death
for
it
has
remained
in
my
stomach
and
occasioned
the
stoppage
which
has
ended
in
inflammation
and
mortification
i
feel
it
here
even
now
give
me
your
finger
do
you
feel
it
well
now
you
understand
why
i
talked
of
the
little
white
cat
do
cut
off
my
head
but
when
i
am
dead
just
put
your
knife
down
there
and
take
out
the
diamond
and
bury
it
for
i
tell
you
and
they
say
dying
men
see
clearer
than
others
but
that
i
am
certain
you
will
be
released
from
these
mines
and
then
the
diamond
will
be
a
fortune
to
you
and
you
will
find
that
being
my
executor
was
of
some
value
to
you
now
pray
no
scruple
i
entreat
it
as
a
last
favour
promise
me
that
you
will
do
as
i
wish
pray
promise
me
or
i
shall
die
unhappy
i
could
not
help
promising
him
to
execute
his
wishes
he
appeared
so
earnest
and
asked
it
as
a
last
favour
but
i
felt
very
repugnant
at
the
idea
in
another
hour
poor
ingram
breathed
his
last
and
i
was
most
melancholy
at
the
loss
of
so
worthy
a
friend
who
had
by
serving
me
been
subjected
to
the
same
slavery
as
myself
i
left
the
hut
and
went
to
my
own
house
thinking
over
the
strange
communication
that
had
been
made
to
me
and
why
thought
i
should
i
obtain
this
diamond
i
have
no
chance
of
leaving
this
yet
who
knows
ingram
prophesied
in
his
dying
moments
that
i
should
well
at
all
events
i
will
keep
my
promise
to
the
poor
fellow
i
reported
his
death
to
the
director
and
about
an
hour
afterwards
went
to
the
hut
where
he
lay
his
countenance
was
placid
and
i
looked
at
him
for
a
long
while
and
queried
whether
he
was
not
happier
than
i
was
or
ever
could
be
but
to
comply
with
his
request
i
could
not
bear
the
idea
i
did
not
want
the
diamond
and
i
who
in
my
early
career
had
thought
nothing
of
cutting
and
maiming
the
living
man
now
shuddered
at
the
idea
of
making
an
incision
in
a
dead
body
but
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
the
burials
always
took
place
at
sunset
and
it
was
near
the
hour
i
bent
a
piece
of
bamboo
cane
double
like
a
pair
of
and
then
putting
my
finger
to
the
part
of
his
stomach
which
he
had
pointed
out
i
felt
that
there
was
a
hard
substance
and
i
made
an
incision
with
my
knife
probing
with
the
blade
i
touched
the
diamond
and
then
using
the
piece
of
cane
as
a
pair
of
pincers
i
contrived
after
one
or
two
attempts
to
extract
it
i
threw
the
diamond
without
examination
into
a
pan
of
water
which
stood
by
the
bed
and
covering
up
the
body
i
made
a
hole
in
the
floor
of
the
hut
and
buried
the
knife
which
i
felt
i
never
could
use
again
i
looked
out
of
the
hut
and
perceived
two
of
the
slaves
who
performed
that
office
coming
towards
me
to
take
away
the
body
i
desired
them
to
carry
it
leaving
the
clothes
on
followed
them
and
saw
it
deposited
in
the
earth
after
which
i
read
prayers
over
the
grave
and
could
not
refrain
from
shedding
many
tears
to
the
memory
of
my
faithful
associate
i
then
returned
to
the
hut
and
taking
the
pan
of
water
in
my
hand
went
to
my
abode
i
could
not
bear
to
touch
the
diamond
but
i
dared
not
leave
it
where
it
was
so
i
poured
all
the
water
out
of
the
pan
and
then
rolled
the
diamond
out
on
the
floor
which
was
of
hardened
clay
i
saw
at
once
that
it
was
one
of
great
value
weighing
i
should
think
thirteen
or
fourteen
and
of
a
very
pure
water
it
was
in
the
form
of
an
obtuse
octahedron
and
on
one
side
was
quite
smooth
and
transparent
having
made
this
examination
i
picked
up
some
of
the
clay
with
a
piece
of
iron
and
rolling
the
diamond
into
the
hole
i
jammed
the
clay
down
over
it
there
said
i
you
may
remain
till
doomsday
or
till
some
one
finds
you
you
will
be
of
no
use
to
me
and
i
thought
of
the
cock
in
the
fable
my
tattered
bible
caught
my
eye
and
i
said
to
it
you
are
of
more
value
than
all
the
diamonds
in
the
world
and
i
only
uttered
what
i
felt
for
a
long
time
i
mourned
for
ingram
and
thought
nothing
of
the
diamond
three
months
more
passed
away
and
i
had
been
eighteen
months
in
the
mines
when
some
visitors
made
their
appearance
no
less
than
one
of
the
principals
of
the
jesuit
order
who
had
been
sent
by
the
king
of
portugal
out
to
the
brazils
on
a
tour
of
inspection
as
it
was
called
but
in
fact
to
examine
into
the
state
of
affairs
and
the
way
in
which
the
government
revenue
was
collected
there
had
lately
been
so
much
peculation
on
the
part
of
the
various
officers
that
it
was
considered
necessary
to
make
minute
inquiry
a
portuguese
nobleman
had
been
sent
out
the
year
before
but
had
died
shortly
after
his
arrival
and
there
was
every
reason
to
suppose
that
he
had
been
poisoned
that
the
inquiry
might
be
got
rid
of
now
this
jesuit
priest
had
been
sent
out
probably
because
a
portuguese
who
thought
little
of
poisoning
and
stabbing
a
layman
would
not
dare
to
attempt
the
life
of
so
sacred
a
character
having
full
and
extraordinary
powers
he
had
made
a
short
inquiry
into
the
different
departments
of
government
and
now
come
to
the
mines
to
ascertain
how
far
the
delivery
of
the
diamonds
at
the
treasury
agreed
with
the
collection
at
the
mines
for
these
mines
had
usually
produced
from
a
million
to
a
million
and
a
half
of
revenue
the
director
was
in
a
great
fuss
when
he
heard
of
this
arrival
at
the
further
barrier
although
immediately
announced
to
him
he
had
scarcely
an
hour
to
prepare
before
the
superior
of
the
jesuits
arrived
with
his
suite
consisting
of
about
twenty
people
and
fifty
or
sixty
sumpter
mules
and
we
were
all
called
out
to
receive
him
that
is
all
the
inspectors
i
went
to
attend
the
parade
and
awaited
with
much
indifference
but
my
feelings
were
soon
changed
when
in
this
superior
of
the
jesuits
i
beheld
the
catholic
priest
who
had
visited
me
in
the
tower
and
obtained
my
release
the
superior
bowed
to
the
director
and
to
all
around
him
and
as
he
then
looked
at
us
all
he
recognised
me
immediately
you
here
my
son
said
he
yes
holy
father
replied
i
and
i
thank
heaven
that
your
arrival
will
enable
me
to
prove
my
innocence
pray
how
is
this
said
he
in
a
few
words
i
narrated
my
story
and
you
were
thrown
into
prison
without
being
permitted
to
defend
yourself
even
so
good
father
and
sent
to
the
mines
to
slave
for
life
did
you
not
make
known
your
case
to
the
director
of
the
mines
i
did
sir
but
he
stated
that
he
pitied
me
but
could
not
help
me
is
this
the
case
mr
director
said
the
jesuit
severely
it
is
sir
replied
the
director
i
have
more
than
once
reported
cases
of
what
appeared
to
me
great
hardship
if
what
those
condemned
have
said
was
true
and
have
been
told
that
i
was
too
officious
and
that
there
could
be
no
reversal
of
sentence
i
can
prove
to
you
sir
by
my
journals
and
how
many
cases
i
did
formerly
attempt
to
bring
before
the
government
but
i
at
last
received
such
replies
which
i
can
show
you
as
will
prove
that
there
has
been
no
fault
of
mine
allow
me
to
add
holy
father
said
i
that
the
kindness
and
consideration
of
the
director
have
been
very
great
to
all
those
under
his
charge
and
i
think
it
very
fortunate
that
such
a
person
has
been
appointed
to
this
situation
as
he
has
done
everything
that
has
been
in
his
power
to
alleviate
the
miseries
of
bondage
i
am
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
mr
elrington
mr
director
this
gentleman
is
a
dear
friend
of
mine
let
him
instantly
be
released
my
orders
are
not
to
be
disputed
by
the
viceroy
himself
the
superior
then
embraced
me
cordially
and
told
me
that
i
was
free
and
should
return
with
him
to
rio
imagine
my
dear
madam
my
joy
and
gratitude
i
fell
on
my
knees
before
him
and
kissed
his
hands
he
gave
me
his
blessing
and
raised
me
up
where
is
your
companion
in
misfortune
said
he
alas
sir
he
is
dead
replied
i
the
superior
shook
his
head
and
turned
away
saying
i
will
search
into
this
affair
to
the
bottom
depend
upon
it
when
i
get
back
to
rio
he
then
desired
the
director
to
bring
out
his
books
and
his
own
secretary
to
follow
him
leaving
his
servants
in
the
with
me
and
the
other
inspectors
i
received
the
congratulations
of
all
parties
present
and
as
soon
as
possible
i
escaped
from
them
and
returned
to
my
own
room
where
i
knelt
and
fervently
thanked
god
for
my
unexpected
deliverance
and
having
paid
my
duty
to
the
most
high
i
sat
down
and
fell
into
a
most
delightful
reverie
of
anticipations
in
the
evening
after
the
superior
had
dismissed
him
the
director
sent
for
me
and
said
allow
me
to
return
you
many
thanks
for
your
kindness
in
speaking
so
favourably
of
me
as
you
have
done
you
have
indeed
been
of
service
to
me
and
i
am
most
grateful
i
only
did
you
justice
director
replied
i
yes
but
how
few
have
justice
done
them
in
this
world
replied
he
the
superior
desired
me
to
tell
you
that
you
are
to
live
with
the
gentlemen
of
his
suite
of
course
you
know
it
is
not
etiquette
for
him
to
admit
anybody
to
his
table
at
all
events
you
must
allow
me
one
pleasure
which
is
to
supply
you
with
clothes
proper
to
your
appearance
which
i
can
easily
do
without
inconvenience
to
myself
the
director
then
led
me
into
his
room
and
opened
a
wardrobe
full
of
rich
suits
selected
two
of
the
handsomest
with
linen
and
every
other
article
requisite
a
handsome
sword
and
hat
all
of
which
he
begged
me
to
accept
calling
one
of
his
servants
he
ordered
him
to
put
them
into
a
valise
and
take
them
to
my
apartment
is
there
anything
else
that
i
can
do
speak
freely
no
director
replied
i
i
will
accept
these
things
from
you
as
i
can
not
procure
them
here
but
when
at
rio
i
have
means
to
obtain
everything
that
i
require
i
return
you
many
thanks
i
will
send
my
servant
to
arrange
your
hair
said
he
and
i
pray
you
to
consider
him
at
your
disposal
during
the
few
days
which
the
superior
may
remain
here
do
you
think
it
will
take
him
so
long
yes
replied
the
director
i
will
tell
you
in
confidence
that
he
has
brought
with
him
the
produce
of
the
mines
accounted
for
to
the
government
at
home
and
on
his
first
inspection
has
found
such
defalcation
from
that
which
has
been
transmitted
by
me
to
rio
that
i
expect
there
will
be
serious
business
they
never
imagined
at
rio
that
he
would
have
undertaken
such
a
tedious
journey
as
he
has
done
and
they
are
in
much
alarm
about
it
but
i
will
leave
you
now
that
you
may
go
home
and
make
your
toilet
allow
me
to
congratulate
you
with
all
my
heart
at
the
fortunate
termination
to
your
unjust
bondage
having
again
thanked
him
for
his
kindness
i
went
to
my
lodging
where
i
found
his
servant
waiting
for
me
and
having
had
my
hair
arranged
in
a
very
tolerable
manner
and
a
little
powder
thrown
in
i
put
on
one
of
the
suits
which
fitted
me
pretty
well
requiring
but
a
slight
alteration
from
being
rather
full
which
the
servant
soon
managed
thus
did
i
once
more
appear
as
a
gentleman
contrary
to
all
my
expectations
and
i
then
went
and
joined
the
suite
of
the
superior
who
when
they
perceived
the
difference
which
dress
made
in
my
appearance
congratulated
me
and
warmly
welcomed
me
to
join
the
meal
which
had
just
been
prepared
for
them
on
the
following
day
the
superior
sent
for
me
and
ordering
me
to
sit
down
requested
that
i
would
enter
into
full
detail
of
what
had
happened
to
me
since
we
last
parted
i
did
so
and
my
narrative
occupied
the
whole
afternoon
your
life
has
been
full
of
vicissitude
replied
he
i
trust
however
that
your
adventures
are
now
over
and
that
you
will
be
restored
to
your
friends
the
service
you
performed
for
our
cause
will
never
be
forgotten
i
ventured
to
ask
him
how
it
was
that
he
was
now
in
the
employ
of
the
king
of
portugal
he
replied
i
am
an
irishman
by
birth
and
educated
at
saint
omers
i
was
first
sent
to
spain
by
the
order
when
i
was
young
and
have
since
been
employed
all
over
the
world
in
the
advancement
of
our
holy
church
country
with
our
order
is
of
no
consequence
we
all
serve
the
holy
church
and
go
wherever
our
services
are
required
i
would
you
were
a
catholic
i
could
advance
you
beyond
all
your
hopes
but
you
are
engaged
to
be
married
and
that
puts
an
end
to
the
question
as
i
thought
the
holy
father
must
be
tired
with
our
long
conference
i
rose
and
took
my
leave
three
days
afterwards
i
was
informed
by
him
that
he
intended
to
set
off
on
his
return
to
rio
and
now
i
thought
of
the
diamond
which
i
resolved
to
carry
with
me
i
had
no
fear
of
being
searched
while
under
this
excellent
superior
protection
and
therefore
i
went
to
my
lodging
dug
up
the
diamond
and
having
washed
it
for
the
first
time
gave
it
the
examination
which
it
deserved
it
certainly
was
a
stone
of
great
value
but
of
what
value
i
could
not
exactly
say
from
what
i
had
learnt
from
the
director
who
usually
put
his
idea
of
the
value
upon
any
diamond
of
size
which
was
brought
to
him
i
considered
that
pounds
was
the
least
which
could
be
put
upon
the
stone
i
took
the
precaution
not
to
carry
it
loose
in
my
pocket
but
to
sew
it
within
the
lining
of
my
clothes
glad
i
was
indeed
when
the
orders
to
start
the
next
morning
were
given
out
i
found
that
a
horse
was
appointed
for
me
and
having
made
up
my
valise
not
forgetting
my
tattered
bible
i
went
to
my
bed
thanking
god
that
this
was
to
be
the
last
night
that
i
was
to
pass
in
the
accursed
sierra
de
espinhaco
at
daylight
the
superior
took
his
leave
mounted
his
mule
and
we
set
forth
passing
the
in
the
narrow
road
which
i
never
expected
to
pass
again
before
noon
we
were
clear
of
the
sierra
and
once
more
in
the
open
country
the
attendants
with
a
portion
of
the
sumpter
mules
went
in
advance
to
prepare
for
the
superior
arrival
at
the
spot
where
we
were
to
halt
the
weather
was
excessively
sultry
and
the
glare
of
the
sun
was
very
distressing
at
noon
we
stopped
to
take
our
dinner
and
the
usual
siesta
after
it
the
attendants
in
advance
had
raised
a
sort
of
palanquin
for
the
superior
and
everything
was
ready
the
superior
alighted
and
sat
down
under
the
palanquin
which
protected
him
from
the
rays
of
the
sun
we
all
sat
round
at
a
respectful
distance
the
heat
was
so
intense
that
to
relieve
himself
the
superior
had
when
he
sat
down
thrown
off
his
long
black
robe
such
as
is
worn
by
the
priests
of
his
order
dinner
was
served
up
and
we
had
a
merry
party
notwithstanding
the
great
heat
after
our
meal
we
all
shaded
ourselves
as
well
as
we
could
and
took
our
siesta
for
about
two
hours
when
the
superior
rose
up
and
gave
the
signal
for
resuming
our
journey
the
horses
were
soon
ready
and
the
superior
mule
being
brought
up
to
the
palanquin
he
rose
up
and
one
of
his
attendants
was
lifting
up
his
robe
for
the
superior
to
resume
it
when
my
eye
detected
the
head
of
a
snake
just
showing
itself
out
of
the
of
the
robe
in
which
he
carried
his
breviary
and
his
handkerchief
i
knew
the
snake
well
for
we
often
found
them
in
the
sierra
de
espinhaco
and
some
two
or
three
of
the
slaves
had
lost
their
lives
by
their
bite
which
was
so
fatal
that
they
died
in
less
than
five
minutes
afterwards
the
superior
had
his
handkerchief
in
his
hand
and
would
have
undoubtedly
put
it
in
his
pocket
before
he
mounted
his
mule
and
if
so
would
certainly
have
been
bitten
and
lost
his
life
as
the
superior
was
fastening
his
robe
at
the
throat
i
darted
forward
seized
it
threw
it
on
the
ground
and
commenced
stamping
upon
it
with
all
my
force
much
to
the
surprise
of
the
whole
party
some
of
them
thought
me
mad
and
others
who
were
horrified
at
such
treatment
of
the
holy
garment
called
out
heretico
maldetto
which
madam
you
must
know
means
accursed
heretic
having
felt
the
snake
which
is
very
short
but
very
thick
in
the
body
with
a
head
like
a
toad
several
times
moving
under
my
feet
and
then
moving
no
more
i
then
stepped
off
the
garment
and
turning
it
over
i
lifted
it
up
by
the
skirt
so
that
the
dead
snake
rolled
out
of
the
pocket
i
thank
the
god
whom
we
all
worship
and
the
son
of
god
who
died
for
us
all
whether
catholic
or
heretic
cried
i
that
i
have
been
the
means
of
preserving
the
holy
father
i
had
knelt
down
as
i
thus
prayed
and
the
superior
perceiving
the
danger
that
he
had
been
in
did
the
same
and
silently
returned
his
thanks
at
his
example
all
the
rest
went
down
on
their
knees
yes
said
the
superior
would
to
god
that
instead
of
reviling
each
other
all
denominations
of
christians
would
join
in
thus
bruising
the
head
of
the
serpent
which
seeks
our
spiritual
death
he
then
rose
and
said
my
son
i
thank
thee
for
the
kind
service
thou
hast
performed
i
then
explained
to
the
superior
the
deadly
nature
of
the
animal
and
my
fear
that
he
would
have
put
his
handkerchief
in
the
pocket
of
his
robe
before
i
had
time
to
prevent
him
and
begged
him
to
excuse
my
seeming
abruptness
there
needs
no
apology
for
saving
a
man
life
replied
he
come
let
us
go
forward
i
hardly
need
say
that
we
were
not
quite
so
long
in
returning
to
rio
as
we
were
in
going
to
the
mines
we
accomplished
our
journey
without
using
extreme
haste
in
about
half
of
the
time
on
our
arrival
we
took
up
our
quarters
at
a
magnificent
palace
which
had
been
appropriated
to
the
superior
during
his
residence
at
rio
and
i
found
myself
sumptuously
lodged
for
some
days
during
which
the
superior
had
frequent
interviews
with
the
viceroy
i
did
not
see
him
but
one
day
i
was
summoned
to
his
presence
my
son
said
he
i
have
lost
no
time
in
investigating
your
affair
and
i
find
that
all
you
have
said
is
quite
correct
to
the
disgrace
of
the
government
here
and
the
manner
in
which
justice
is
administered
it
appears
that
this
man
olivarez
on
his
arrival
went
to
the
secretary
of
the
judge
of
that
court
in
which
such
offences
are
tried
and
stated
that
he
had
two
english
mutineers
on
board
who
had
attempted
to
take
the
vessel
and
wounded
several
of
his
men
dangerously
that
he
wished
of
course
to
deliver
them
up
to
justice
but
that
the
immediate
departure
of
his
vessel
would
be
prevented
by
so
doing
as
his
crew
would
be
required
as
evidence
that
the
delay
would
be
very
disadvantageous
and
he
inquired
whether
it
could
not
be
managed
that
these
men
might
be
punished
without
the
appearance
of
himself
and
his
men
as
he
would
pay
a
good
sum
rather
than
be
detained
the
secretary
perfectly
understood
the
trick
and
upon
the
receipt
of
five
hundred
cruzados
he
accepted
the
deposition
of
olivarez
sworn
to
by
him
as
sufficient
evidence
and
you
were
consigned
to
the
mines
upon
this
deposition
by
a
warrant
from
the
judge
we
have
had
some
trouble
to
obtain
all
the
facts
but
the
question
has
been
severely
applied
and
has
elicited
them
now
first
as
to
the
judge
and
his
secretary
they
have
gone
to
the
gaol
and
will
take
your
place
in
the
mines
for
life
next
as
to
olivarez
it
appears
that
on
his
arrival
he
sold
his
cargo
of
slaves
very
advantageously
that
having
received
the
money
he
gave
a
small
portion
to
each
of
his
men
and
that
they
went
on
shore
and
like
all
english
seamen
were
soon
in
a
state
of
intoxication
that
olivarez
took
such
steps
with
the
police
as
to
have
them
all
thrown
into
prison
when
in
that
state
and
on
the
following
morning
he
went
to
them
persuaded
them
that
they
had
committed
themselves
during
their
intoxication
and
that
it
required
a
large
sum
to
free
them
this
he
pretended
to
have
paid
for
them
and
having
purchased
a
cargo
for
his
voyage
he
got
them
all
on
board
and
again
ran
for
the
coast
of
africa
in
three
months
he
returned
with
another
cargo
which
he
sold
he
had
found
out
his
mother
and
now
he
expended
the
money
he
had
made
in
purchasing
a
good
property
about
seven
miles
from
rio
where
he
placed
his
mother
and
some
slaves
to
take
care
of
it
and
cultivate
it
he
contrived
to
defraud
his
crew
as
much
as
he
could
and
before
he
went
to
the
coast
again
he
married
an
amiable
young
person
the
daughter
of
a
neighbour
he
made
a
third
and
a
fourth
voyage
with
equal
success
but
on
the
third
voyage
he
contrived
to
get
rid
of
a
portion
of
his
english
crew
who
were
now
becoming
troublesome
by
taking
some
portuguese
sailors
out
with
him
and
leaving
the
english
on
the
coast
as
if
by
mistake
previous
to
the
fourth
voyage
it
appears
that
he
satisfied
the
remainder
of
the
english
crew
by
producing
accounts
and
sharing
out
to
them
several
hundred
dollars
previous
to
their
departure
for
the
coast
he
made
a
slight
addition
to
his
portuguese
sailors
not
putting
too
many
on
board
to
avoid
suspicion
and
when
on
the
coast
of
africa
a
portion
of
the
english
crew
died
whether
by
poison
or
not
is
not
known
and
the
others
he
put
on
shore
seizing
all
their
property
and
the
dollars
with
which
he
had
satisfied
them
on
his
return
from
his
fourth
voyage
having
now
nothing
to
fear
from
the
partners
in
his
atrocious
deed
having
realised
a
large
sum
he
determined
to
remain
on
shore
altogether
and
live
on
his
property
with
his
mother
and
wife
he
did
so
and
sent
out
the
schooner
under
a
portuguese
captain
and
crew
to
be
employed
for
him
as
owner
in
the
slave
traffic
and
she
has
made
two
voyages
since
and
is
expected
back
again
every
day
now
my
son
retribution
has
fallen
heavily
upon
this
bad
man
had
he
been
discovered
and
punished
when
he
first
did
the
deed
it
would
have
been
as
nothing
compared
to
what
it
has
been
now
he
then
had
no
property
no
ties
in
fact
nothing
or
little
to
regret
but
now
with
a
wife
and
child
with
a
valuable
property
living
in
independence
and
increasing
that
wealth
daily
now
when
he
is
at
the
very
summit
of
his
ambition
restored
to
his
own
country
respected
and
considered
as
being
a
man
of
wealth
he
has
been
seized
thrown
into
a
dungeon
put
to
the
question
and
now
lies
in
a
state
of
misery
awaiting
the
sentence
of
death
which
has
been
pronounced
against
him
neither
has
he
the
consolation
of
knowing
that
he
leaves
those
whom
he
loves
in
a
state
of
affluence
for
all
his
property
having
been
gained
by
making
use
of
your
property
necessarily
is
your
property
and
not
his
and
it
has
been
confiscated
accordingly
for
your
use
and
benefit
as
soon
as
everything
is
collected
it
will
be
paid
into
your
hands
thus
my
son
i
have
at
last
attained
justice
for
you
i
was
as
you
may
imagine
my
dear
madam
profuse
in
my
acknowledgments
but
he
stopped
me
saying
i
was
sent
here
to
see
that
justice
was
done
to
everybody
if
i
possibly
could
no
easy
task
when
all
are
amassing
money
not
caring
how
they
obtain
it
but
surely
if
any
one
has
peculiar
claims
upon
me
it
is
you
the
superior
then
asked
me
many
questions
relative
to
my
parentage
and
i
did
not
conceal
anything
from
him
i
told
who
i
was
and
why
at
an
early
age
i
had
left
my
father
house
he
asked
me
many
questions
and
after
about
two
hours
conversation
he
dismissed
me
saying
you
may
always
depend
upon
my
protection
and
gratitude
before
he
dismissed
me
he
told
me
that
he
was
about
to
send
a
to
lisbon
and
as
i
might
wish
to
inform
my
friends
of
my
safety
if
i
would
write
letters
he
would
insure
their
being
safely
delivered
to
my
friends
in
england
i
gladly
availed
myself
of
this
offer
and
indeed
would
have
begged
a
passage
for
myself
if
it
had
not
been
that
i
considered
olivarez
money
to
be
the
property
of
mr
trevannion
and
was
determined
to
remit
it
to
him
before
i
left
rio
this
detained
me
about
six
weeks
longer
during
which
interval
olivarez
had
suffered
the
penalty
due
to
his
crimes
having
been
strangled
in
the
market
place
the
money
received
was
cruzados
and
not
knowing
how
to
dispose
of
it
i
applied
to
the
superior
who
gave
me
orders
for
it
in
duplicates
upon
the
treasury
at
lisbon
one
of
which
i
had
very
soon
an
opportunity
of
sending
home
to
mr
trevannion
with
a
duplicate
of
my
first
letter
and
a
second
to
him
and
amy
stating
my
intention
of
returning
as
soon
as
possible
but
this
was
by
a
portuguese
frigate
which
made
a
very
circuitous
route
home
and
i
did
not
choose
to
go
by
that
conveyance
as
her
detention
at
the
different
ports
was
so
uncertain
at
last
i
became
very
impatient
for
my
departure
and
anxiously
awaited
the
sailing
of
some
vessel
to
any
port
of
europe
i
had
reserved
cruzados
for
my
own
expenses
which
i
considered
as
quite
sufficient
but
they
were
gradually
wasting
away
for
i
was
everywhere
received
and
in
the
best
company
of
rio
at
last
one
day
the
superior
sent
for
me
and
told
me
that
he
was
about
to
send
an
to
lisbon
and
i
might
take
a
passage
if
i
wished
that
it
was
a
very
small
one
but
a
very
fast
sailer
i
thanked
him
heartily
accepted
the
proposal
and
went
to
my
room
to
pack
up
my
clothes
in
the
afternoon
the
captain
of
the
xebeque
called
upon
me
and
told
me
that
he
would
start
on
the
following
morning
if
i
would
be
ready
i
replied
that
i
should
be
put
some
dollars
into
his
hands
requesting
that
he
would
procure
for
me
anything
that
he
considered
would
be
necessary
and
agreeable
and
if
the
sum
i
had
given
him
was
not
enough
i
would
repay
him
the
remainder
as
soon
as
we
were
out
of
harbour
i
took
my
leave
of
the
superior
who
parted
with
me
with
many
protestations
of
regard
on
his
side
and
tears
of
gratitude
on
mine
and
early
the
next
morning
i
was
on
board
of
the
xebeque
in
light
winds
she
was
extremely
fast
but
she
certainly
was
too
small
to
cross
the
atlantic
ocean
nevertheless
as
the
captain
said
she
had
crossed
it
several
times
and
he
hoped
that
she
often
would
again
the
passage
however
that
he
usually
made
was
to
run
up
to
the
northward
of
the
antilles
and
then
cross
over
making
the
bahama
isles
and
from
thence
taking
a
fresh
departure
for
lisbon
our
crew
consisted
of
only
eight
men
besides
the
captain
but
as
the
vessel
was
not
more
than
thirty
tons
they
were
sufficient
we
made
a
good
run
until
we
were
in
about
degrees
of
north
latitude
when
as
we
stretched
to
the
eastward
to
cross
the
atlantic
we
met
with
a
most
violent
gale
which
lasted
several
days
and
i
fully
expected
every
hour
that
the
vessel
would
go
down
buried
as
she
was
by
the
heavy
sea
at
last
we
had
no
chance
but
to
scud
before
the
wind
which
we
did
for
two
days
before
a
raging
and
following
sea
that
appeared
determined
upon
our
destruction
on
the
second
night
as
i
was
on
deck
watching
the
breaking
and
tossing
of
the
billows
and
the
swift
career
of
the
little
bark
which
enabled
her
to
avoid
them
the
water
suddenly
appeared
of
one
white
foam
and
as
we
rose
upon
the
next
sea
we
were
hurled
along
on
its
crest
reeling
on
the
foam
until
it
had
passed
us
and
then
we
struck
heavily
upon
a
rock
fortunately
it
was
a
soft
coral
rock
or
we
had
all
perished
the
next
wave
lifted
us
up
again
and
threw
us
further
on
and
on
its
receding
the
little
xebeque
laid
high
and
dry
and
careened
over
on
her
bilge
the
waters
rose
and
fell
and
roared
and
foamed
about
us
but
they
lifted
us
no
more
neither
did
they
wash
us
off
the
decks
as
we
clung
to
the
rigging
for
the
stout
short
mast
upon
which
the
lateen
sail
was
hoisted
had
not
been
carried
away
we
remained
where
we
were
till
morning
every
one
holding
on
and
not
communicating
with
each
other
as
the
night
wore
away
so
did
the
gale
decrease
and
the
sea
subside
the
waters
now
gradually
left
us
at
intervals
when
the
waves
receded
we
could
walk
on
shore
but
we
remained
on
the
vessel
till
noon
by
which
time
we
found
our
vessel
high
and
dry
having
been
carried
over
a
coral
reef
which
appeared
to
extend
one
or
two
miles
into
the
offing
the
men
who
had
been
much
buffeted
by
the
waves
and
who
were
exhausted
by
clinging
so
long
to
the
rigging
now
that
they
found
themselves
safe
and
were
warmed
by
the
heat
of
the
sun
rallied
and
began
to
move
about
we
had
a
long
consultation
as
to
how
we
should
act
there
was
no
chance
of
getting
the
vessel
off
again
and
we
did
not
exactly
know
where
we
were
but
the
captain
and
i
agreed
that
it
must
be
upon
one
of
the
small
islands
of
the
bahama
group
that
we
had
been
cast
away
and
our
conjecture
was
right
after
some
consultation
the
captain
and
i
called
the
men
together
and
told
them
that
it
was
very
probable
that
we
might
be
some
time
before
we
could
find
the
means
of
getting
off
the
island
and
that
therefore
we
must
all
do
our
best
that
we
would
land
and
erect
a
tent
with
the
sails
and
obtain
provisions
after
that
we
would
consider
the
vessel
and
her
stores
as
public
property
but
that
every
man
private
property
should
be
secured
to
him
as
if
we
were
still
on
board
of
the
xebeque
that
the
captain
should
retain
the
command
as
before
and
his
orders
should
be
obeyed
by
everybody
as
long
as
they
were
reasonable
and
just
the
men
who
were
quiet
fellows
and
not
like
english
seamen
given
to
liquor
readily
agreed
and
it
was
arranged
that
the
following
morning
we
should
commence
our
labours
this
was
a
sad
blow
to
me
who
was
anticipating
a
speedy
meeting
with
amy
i
knew
how
doubtful
was
the
chance
of
our
being
seen
by
any
vessel
and
that
i
must
remain
here
for
months
if
not
longer
but
i
had
been
schooled
and
could
now
say
with
fervency
thy
will
o
lord
and
not
mine
be
done
we
remained
on
board
of
the
vessel
that
night
and
the
next
morning
the
gale
had
ceased
and
the
waters
to
our
astonishment
had
receded
so
as
to
leave
us
at
least
sixty
yards
from
the
sea
which
was
now
almost
calm
we
first
took
a
survey
of
the
island
to
ascertain
if
there
was
any
water
and
as
the
island
was
not
more
than
two
miles
in
circumference
this
did
not
take
us
long
fortunately
in
the
centre
we
found
a
deep
hole
sunk
in
the
soft
coral
rock
by
some
other
people
who
had
been
wrecked
here
and
in
the
hole
the
water
was
although
a
little
brackish
somewhat
palatable
it
evidently
was
the
filtered
through
the
soft
rock
the
whole
of
the
island
was
surrounded
with
coral
reefs
with
lanes
of
deep
water
running
between
them
and
the
fish
were
sporting
in
thousands
after
the
storm
but
there
was
not
a
tree
or
vestige
of
vegetation
upon
the
whole
island
we
soon
however
discovered
that
it
was
frequented
by
turtle
for
we
found
some
eggs
in
the
sand
having
made
this
survey
we
then
went
back
to
the
vessel
and
with
spars
and
sails
rigged
a
tent
upon
the
highest
point
of
the
island
which
might
be
ten
or
fifteen
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
the
tent
was
large
enough
to
hold
fifty
men
if
required
so
we
brought
our
bedding
and
chests
and
all
our
cooking
apparatus
on
shore
made
a
outside
the
tent
with
the
little
caboose
we
had
on
board
of
the
vessel
sent
a
man
to
obtain
water
from
the
hole
and
put
on
some
meat
to
boil
for
our
dinners
in
the
evening
we
all
went
out
to
turn
turtle
and
succeeded
in
turning
three
when
we
decided
that
we
would
not
capture
any
more
until
we
had
made
a
to
put
them
in
for
we
had
not
more
than
two
months
provisions
on
board
of
the
vessel
and
did
not
know
how
long
we
might
be
detained
the
men
behaved
very
well
and
indeed
seemed
determined
to
make
themselves
as
comfortable
as
they
could
under
existing
circumstances
the
next
day
we
put
out
some
lines
in
deep
water
and
caught
several
large
fish
and
then
we
went
to
find
a
proper
spot
for
a
we
selected
a
hole
in
the
reef
which
we
thought
would
answer
as
we
had
only
one
end
of
it
to
fill
up
and
we
commenced
breaking
away
the
rock
with
crowbars
and
worked
hard
the
whole
of
the
day
some
breaking
and
others
carrying
the
masses
broken
off
by
degrees
they
rose
to
the
surface
of
the
water
and
in
two
days
more
we
calculated
that
the
pond
would
be
ready
to
receive
the
turtle
we
had
killed
one
turtle
in
the
morning
and
we
now
lived
upon
it
altogether
as
we
wished
to
save
our
salt
provisions
the
captain
and
i
had
many
consultations
as
to
what
we
should
do
and
what
attempts
we
should
make
to
get
off
from
this
spot
build
a
boat
we
could
not
as
we
had
not
a
carpenter
among
us
or
the
means
of
making
the
necessary
we
had
some
tools
such
as
are
usually
used
on
board
of
vessels
and
several
pounds
of
large
nails
but
none
fit
for
i
proposed
that
we
should
examine
the
bottom
of
the
xebeque
and
see
what
damage
was
done
to
it
we
did
so
and
found
that
the
garboard
strake
was
broken
and
two
of
her
timbers
but
they
were
easy
to
repair
in
every
other
respect
she
was
sound
i
then
proposed
that
we
should
cut
down
the
xebeque
to
a
large
boat
which
we
could
easily
do
by
ripping
off
her
planks
and
decks
and
sawing
down
her
timbers
to
the
height
we
required
it
would
be
a
heavy
boat
it
was
true
but
we
should
be
able
to
launch
her
with
rollers
and
the
draught
of
water
would
be
so
small
that
we
could
get
her
over
the
reefs
which
we
could
not
possibly
do
the
xebeque
the
captain
approved
of
the
idea
and
we
agreed
that
as
soon
as
the
was
finished
we
would
make
the
attempt
in
two
days
more
we
had
finished
the
pond
and
had
turned
thirty
turtle
which
we
put
into
it
the
men
now
that
they
found
that
they
had
plenty
to
eat
began
to
show
signs
of
laziness
and
did
not
very
readily
commence
the
work
upon
the
xebeque
they
ate
and
slept
ate
and
slept
again
on
the
mattresses
spread
in
the
tent
at
times
they
would
fish
but
it
was
with
difficulty
that
the
captain
and
i
could
persuade
them
to
work
and
if
they
did
work
half
an
hour
they
then
threw
down
their
axes
and
crowbars
and
went
back
to
the
tent
they
had
plenty
of
tobacco
and
they
smoked
half
the
day
ate
turtle
and
then
slept
again
nevertheless
as
the
captain
and
i
worked
hard
the
work
progressed
in
about
ten
days
after
we
began
the
work
we
had
ripped
off
her
decks
and
her
as
as
low
as
we
thought
right
and
we
were
now
sawing
through
the
timbers
when
the
quiet
of
our
party
was
disturbed
by
what
may
be
considered
a
very
strange
quarrel
one
of
the
men
asserted
in
conversation
that
saint
antony
was
born
in
padua
one
or
two
of
the
other
seamen
denied
it
and
this
difference
of
opinion
which
at
first
was
a
mere
nothing
from
sullenness
i
presume
and
something
being
required
to
excite
them
in
the
course
of
a
day
or
two
ended
in
a
serious
feud
the
paduans
terming
the
heretics
and
jews
the
epithet
of
jew
was
what
irritated
so
much
and
the
parties
being
exactly
even
four
on
each
side
on
the
third
day
after
an
angry
altercation
they
all
rushed
out
of
the
tent
to
decide
the
affair
with
their
knives
the
conflict
was
very
fierce
and
took
place
when
the
captain
and
i
were
at
the
xebeque
and
before
we
could
separate
them
four
of
them
had
fallen
two
were
killed
and
the
other
two
badly
wounded
it
may
appear
ridiculous
that
people
should
take
each
lives
for
such
a
trifle
but
after
all
nations
declare
war
against
each
other
and
thousands
are
killed
on
both
sides
for
causes
almost
as
slight
with
great
difficulty
we
separated
the
remaining
combatants
and
such
was
their
rage
and
excitement
that
every
now
and
then
they
would
attempt
to
break
from
us
and
attack
each
other
again
but
at
last
we
disarmed
them
this
was
a
sad
business
and
it
was
melancholy
to
think
that
companions
in
misfortune
should
take
each
other
lives
instead
of
feeling
grateful
to
the
almighty
for
their
preservation
we
buried
the
two
men
who
had
fallen
and
dressed
the
wounds
of
the
hurt
but
after
this
quarrel
the
four
others
came
to
their
work
and
continued
steady
at
it
we
had
now
removed
the
upper
portion
of
the
xebeque
and
commenced
fixing
beams
and
carlines
on
the
lower
part
so
as
to
make
a
decked
boat
of
it
and
in
another
week
we
had
decked
her
over
but
we
had
a
great
deal
more
to
do
we
had
to
reduce
the
mast
and
yard
to
a
proper
size
to
alter
the
sail
and
rigging
to
make
a
small
rudder
and
rollers
to
launch
her
upon
all
this
with
our
reduced
force
occupied
us
another
month
for
the
two
wounded
men
although
recovering
could
but
just
crawl
about
we
turned
many
more
turtle
at
night
that
we
might
have
a
sufficient
supply
we
now
looked
out
for
a
channel
of
deep
water
through
the
reef
to
get
our
boat
out
and
made
one
out
to
a
certain
extent
but
could
not
survey
further
without
getting
off
the
reef
and
the
sharks
were
so
numerous
that
we
dared
not
venture
however
we
took
it
for
granted
as
we
had
found
deep
water
in
shore
that
we
should
be
sure
to
do
so
in
the
offing
and
we
now
got
our
boat
upon
the
rollers
which
we
had
made
by
digging
away
the
sand
from
beneath
her
and
a
trench
to
the
water
edge
we
had
been
two
months
on
the
island
when
all
was
ready
for
launching
anxious
as
i
was
to
return
to
england
i
can
not
say
that
i
was
unhappy
when
on
this
island
there
was
always
a
fine
which
cooled
the
air
and
enabled
us
to
work
without
exhaustion
with
the
exception
of
the
unfortunate
quarrel
i
have
referred
to
everything
went
on
quietly
after
work
was
over
i
resorted
as
usual
to
my
bible
and
read
for
hours
and
this
calmed
and
allayed
any
impatient
feelings
which
might
at
times
arise
i
felt
that
i
had
great
cause
to
be
grateful
to
the
almighty
for
preserving
me
as
he
had
done
and
that
it
would
be
folly
and
wickedness
on
my
part
to
repine
because
i
could
not
obtain
all
that
i
wished
i
waited
therefore
for
his
own
good
time
without
murmuring
and
in
full
confidence
that
all
was
for
the
best
at
last
we
contrived
to
get
our
boat
into
the
water
and
she
floated
much
lighter
than
we
thought
she
would
have
done
considering
the
weight
of
wood
that
was
in
her
as
soon
as
she
was
anchored
about
ten
feet
from
the
beach
we
made
a
gangway
to
her
with
planks
and
commenced
getting
all
our
salt
provisions
water
and
stores
which
we
had
selected
as
most
necessary
on
board
of
her
the
stowage
of
these
occupied
us
two
days
we
then
got
the
yard
up
and
bent
the
sail
and
having
fitted
oars
we
determined
that
the
next
day
we
would
embark
as
she
still
swam
light
we
got
on
board
of
her
as
many
turtle
as
we
could
conveniently
carry
and
then
for
the
last
time
went
on
shore
to
sleep
as
there
was
no
room
for
our
chests
it
was
agreed
that
we
each
should
have
a
bundle
on
board
selecting
those
things
which
we
most
required
and
most
valued
this
proposal
which
was
made
by
the
captain
put
me
in
mind
of
the
diamond
which
had
scarcely
once
entered
my
thoughts
since
i
had
been
on
the
island
when
i
took
it
out
of
my
chest
i
thought
that
i
might
as
well
make
it
more
convenient
to
carry
as
there
was
no
saying
what
might
be
the
result
of
our
new
expedition
so
when
the
other
men
were
all
busy
about
their
own
effects
or
asleep
i
first
took
the
precaution
to
roll
it
up
in
a
covering
of
pitch
so
that
if
taken
from
me
or
lost
it
might
not
be
known
to
be
a
diamond
and
then
i
sewed
it
up
in
a
piece
of
leather
which
i
cut
from
an
old
glove
putting
a
strong
leather
lanyard
to
it
so
that
i
might
wear
it
round
my
neck
having
done
this
without
any
one
taking
notice
and
having
nothing
else
to
do
i
took
some
fine
twine
and
worked
it
over
like
the
mousing
of
a
stay
in
a
way
peculiar
to
sailors
so
that
when
finished
it
was
very
much
in
the
shape
of
a
miniature
buoy
to
an
anchor
and
reminded
me
of
a
or
fender
such
as
they
use
to
prevent
any
injury
to
the
sides
of
a
vessel
when
coming
in
contact
with
another
having
finished
my
work
i
put
the
leather
lanyard
round
my
neck
inside
of
my
shirt
so
that
my
diamond
was
concealed
from
sight
i
then
put
up
my
remaining
which
were
nearly
the
best
of
my
clothes
for
during
my
stay
at
rio
i
had
very
much
increased
my
stock
and
i
hardly
need
say
that
the
old
bible
was
not
left
behind
it
was
a
beautiful
calm
morning
when
we
embarked
and
lifting
the
anchor
took
to
our
oars
and
pulled
out
through
the
deep
channel
the
captain
standing
at
the
bow
and
conning
us
through
while
i
took
the
helm
the
boat
pulled
well
and
steered
well
we
had
yet
to
see
what
she
could
do
under
canvass
after
a
pull
of
two
hours
we
were
clear
of
the
reef
and
out
in
the
open
sea
we
then
laid
in
the
oars
and
commenced
our
preparations
for
hoisting
the
sail
to
a
breeze
which
then
blew
from
the
southward
when
all
was
ready
the
men
hoisted
the
sail
but
in
so
doing
a
rope
being
foul
as
i
was
attempting
to
clear
it
i
was
tripped
up
and
fell
with
my
right
knee
on
a
spike
which
entered
deep
putting
me
to
excruciating
pain
and
laming
me
completely
i
was
obliged
to
sit
down
abaft
for
i
nearly
fainted
away
in
the
mean
time
the
sail
was
set
and
the
boat
stood
well
up
to
it
she
proved
to
be
very
stiff
under
canvass
which
was
a
source
of
great
congratulation
my
knee
became
so
painful
and
stiff
that
i
could
not
move
it
i
took
one
of
my
shirts
out
of
my
bundle
tore
it
up
into
bandages
and
put
them
on
we
had
resolved
to
attempt
to
make
new
providence
the
largest
of
the
bahama
group
where
we
knew
that
there
was
a
town
called
nassau
and
from
whence
we
hoped
to
obtain
some
conveyance
to
europe
but
we
knew
nothing
of
the
port
or
the
inhabitants
or
what
trade
was
carried
on
with
them
for
several
hours
our
little
bark
went
gaily
over
the
water
but
towards
nightfall
the
wind
shifted
and
the
weather
looked
threatening
we
hardly
knew
how
to
steer
as
we
did
not
know
the
position
of
the
island
which
we
had
left
and
now
the
wind
heading
us
we
hauled
up
on
the
larboard
tack
with
our
head
to
the
northward
and
eastward
as
the
sun
went
down
the
wind
increased
and
the
sea
ran
fast
our
boat
behaved
well
till
it
began
to
blow
very
hard
and
then
it
took
in
so
much
water
that
we
were
forced
to
bale
we
had
reefed
our
sail
and
made
everything
as
snug
as
we
could
but
the
sea
rising
fast
and
the
boat
taking
in
more
water
we
considered
it
prudent
to
lighten
her
which
we
did
by
throwing
overboard
all
the
turtle
this
we
did
without
regret
as
we
were
tired
of
eating
them
for
so
long
a
while
the
day
broke
and
there
appeared
every
sign
of
bad
weather
and
the
waves
now
tossed
and
foamed
too
much
for
such
a
small
craft
as
we
were
in
about
noon
we
saw
a
vessel
on
a
wind
to
leeward
of
us
which
was
a
source
of
great
delight
to
us
all
and
we
bore
down
to
her
we
soon
made
her
out
to
be
an
hermaphrodite
brig
under
her
topsails
and
trysails
we
ran
under
her
counter
and
hailed
we
perceived
several
men
standing
abaft
and
apparently
they
suspected
us
for
a
rover
for
they
had
muskets
and
other
weapons
in
their
hands
we
told
them
that
we
had
been
shipwrecked
and
the
boat
was
sinking
in
the
gale
and
then
we
under
her
lee
there
we
remained
for
four
or
five
hours
during
which
the
wind
and
the
sea
went
down
very
fast
and
the
boat
no
longer
took
in
water
but
we
had
been
all
too
much
alarmed
with
the
danger
in
which
we
had
been
to
like
to
continue
our
voyage
in
her
and
as
we
thought
that
we
could
now
go
alongside
with
safety
we
hailed
again
and
asked
permission
after
some
parleying
they
threw
us
a
rope
which
we
made
fast
to
the
boat
and
lowered
our
sail
keeping
off
on
a
broad
sheer
as
there
still
was
a
great
deal
of
sea
they
then
entered
into
conversation
with
us
i
told
them
all
that
had
happened
and
inquired
where
the
brig
was
bound
to
they
replied
to
james
town
virginia
i
asked
them
if
they
could
give
us
a
passage
there
as
we
were
afraid
to
proceed
in
our
boat
or
if
not
would
they
see
us
safe
into
new
providence
the
captain
then
came
forward
he
was
a
very
dark
man
dark
as
a
mulatto
with
keen
small
eyes
and
a
hooked
nose
i
never
beheld
a
more
deformed
and
repulsive
countenance
he
said
that
he
could
not
go
to
new
providence
as
it
was
out
of
his
way
and
that
we
might
easily
get
there
ourselves
if
we
thought
proper
i
replied
that
the
boat
was
not
sufficiently
large
and
seaworthy
and
that
we
had
already
nearly
gone
down
and
if
another
gale
should
come
on
we
certainly
should
founder
and
again
requested
that
he
would
take
us
on
board
have
you
any
money
to
pay
for
your
passage
inquired
he
why
said
i
common
charity
and
the
feelings
of
a
seaman
towards
sailors
in
distress
should
be
sufficient
to
induce
you
to
take
us
on
board
and
not
leave
us
to
perish
but
if
you
require
money
i
replied
we
have
more
than
sufficient
to
satisfy
you
how
much
screamed
out
a
lad
of
about
fourteen
who
was
the
very
image
of
the
captain
in
miniature
i
did
not
reply
to
this
question
and
the
captain
then
said
what
do
you
propose
to
do
with
the
boat
let
her
go
adrift
to
be
sure
replied
i
what
have
you
got
on
board
of
her
said
he
i
enumerated
as
well
as
i
could
recollect
the
provisions
and
stores
that
we
had
well
replied
he
i
will
wait
till
it
is
a
little
smoother
and
then
we
will
clear
the
boat
and
take
you
on
board
he
then
left
the
gangway
where
he
had
been
standing
and
we
continued
to
be
towed
by
the
brig
i
do
not
like
that
fellow
said
i
to
the
portuguese
captain
he
appears
or
pretends
to
take
us
for
pirates
but
he
is
more
like
a
pirate
himself
he
looks
like
the
devil
himself
replied
the
captain
and
to
ask
people
in
our
condition
to
pay
for
their
passage
he
is
a
monster
however
we
all
have
a
few
doubloons
thank
heaven
about
an
hour
afterwards
it
being
much
more
moderate
the
captain
of
the
brig
told
us
to
sheer
alongside
and
that
four
of
us
might
come
out
and
the
others
remain
in
the
boat
till
she
was
cleared
i
think
you
had
better
go
said
i
to
the
captain
for
with
so
much
motion
i
never
shall
be
able
to
get
up
the
side
with
my
bad
knee
we
then
sheered
the
boat
alongside
and
the
captain
and
three
of
our
men
got
on
board
but
not
without
difficulty
i
saw
them
go
aft
and
down
below
with
the
captain
of
the
brig
but
i
never
saw
them
on
deck
again
much
to
my
surprise
although
we
were
more
than
half
an
hour
before
they
again
hailed
us
and
told
us
to
come
alongside
again
during
this
my
mind
misgave
me
sadly
that
all
was
not
right
from
not
seeing
the
portuguese
captain
or
either
of
the
three
men
and
i
took
it
into
my
head
that
the
vessel
was
a
pirate
and
i
knew
if
such
was
the
case
we
should
instantly
be
rifled
if
not
murdered
i
took
the
precaution
of
taking
off
the
bandage
from
my
knee
and
having
removed
the
diamond
from
my
neck
i
put
it
under
my
ham
in
the
cavity
which
held
it
with
ease
and
then
put
the
bandage
on
again
over
it
as
i
thought
they
would
hardly
take
a
bandage
off
a
bad
knee
to
see
if
there
was
anything
concealed
beneath
it
it
was
with
difficulty
that
i
contrived
to
get
on
board
the
brig
and
as
soon
as
i
had
gained
the
deck
i
was
ordered
to
go
down
into
the
cabin
as
i
went
aft
i
looked
round
for
the
portuguese
captain
and
the
men
but
could
not
see
them
i
contrived
with
difficulty
to
get
down
into
the
cabin
and
as
soon
as
i
was
there
i
was
seized
by
the
arms
and
held
fast
by
two
of
the
men
while
others
bound
me
with
seizings
as
the
captain
was
looking
on
i
inquired
into
the
cause
of
this
outrage
he
replied
that
we
were
a
parcel
of
rascally
pirates
who
would
have
taken
his
vessel
if
he
had
not
been
too
deep
for
us
i
told
him
it
was
false
and
that
i
could
easily
prove
it
as
we
still
had
the
despatches
on
board
with
which
we
had
been
charged
and
that
i
could
show
good
proof
that
i
was
the
same
person
that
i
stated
myself
to
be
that
i
very
much
feared
that
we
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
pirates
ourselves
but
that
i
would
have
justice
done
as
soon
as
we
arrived
at
james
town
without
he
intended
to
murder
us
all
before
we
arrived
his
answer
was
that
he
was
too
old
a
bird
to
be
caught
with
such
chaff
and
that
he
would
secure
us
and
deliver
us
up
to
the
authorities
as
soon
as
he
arrived
i
replied
in
great
anger
that
he
would
then
be
convinced
of
his
error
if
it
was
an
error
on
his
part
that
his
conduct
was
infamous
and
he
looked
like
a
scoundrel
and
i
believed
him
to
be
one
you
call
me
a
scoundrel
do
you
said
he
levelling
a
pistol
at
my
head
you
call
us
scoundrels
do
you
cried
the
boy
i
have
made
mention
of
and
who
was
evidently
the
son
of
the
captain
taking
up
another
pistol
in
his
hand
shall
i
shoot
him
father
no
peleg
not
yet
we
will
pay
them
all
when
we
get
in
take
him
away
and
put
him
in
irons
with
the
rest
said
the
captain
and
i
was
immediately
dragged
forward
between
decks
through
a
door
in
the
bulkheads
where
i
found
the
portuguese
captain
and
three
seamen
already
in
irons
this
is
pretty
treatment
said
he
to
me
yes
it
is
indeed
replied
i
but
i
will
make
him
smart
for
it
when
we
arrive
shall
we
ever
arrive
said
the
portuguese
captain
looking
at
me
and
compressing
his
lips
i
say
my
man
said
i
to
the
seaman
who
stood
over
us
with
a
pistol
and
a
cutlass
who
are
you
and
what
are
you
tell
us
the
truth
are
you
pirates
i
never
was
yet
replied
he
nor
do
i
mean
to
be
but
our
skipper
says
that
you
are
and
that
he
knew
you
as
soon
as
you
came
alongside
that
all
i
can
say
about
it
why
if
we
are
pirates
as
he
says
and
he
recognises
us
he
must
have
been
in
pirates
company
that
is
clear
well
he
may
have
been
for
all
i
know
replied
the
man
i
consider
him
any
very
great
things
but
he
is
our
captain
and
we
must
obey
orders
the
man
now
brought
forward
the
other
three
men
who
had
been
left
in
the
boat
they
told
us
that
the
boat
had
been
cleared
all
the
provisions
stores
sails
etcetera
had
been
taken
out
of
her
a
proof
that
she
had
been
gutted
and
then
cut
adrift
that
all
our
bundles
were
down
in
the
captain
cabin
and
that
the
urchin
his
son
had
overhauled
them
one
after
another
and
handed
to
his
father
all
the
money
that
he
had
found
that
they
had
been
searched
very
carefully
and
that
they
had
heard
the
captain
say
that
we
were
all
to
be
sent
up
one
by
one
and
searched
in
the
same
manner
and
so
it
proved
i
was
first
taken
aft
to
have
my
pockets
rummaged
by
the
little
villain
and
as
soon
as
i
had
been
led
forward
and
again
put
into
irons
the
portuguese
captain
and
three
other
seamen
were
sent
for
and
treated
in
the
same
way
we
inquired
of
the
men
what
money
they
had
in
their
bundles
and
about
their
persons
they
had
each
man
four
doubloons
at
rio
for
wages
and
the
captain
had
about
forty
doubloons
i
had
five
hundred
so
that
altogether
we
had
been
robbed
to
the
tune
of
about
four
hundred
pounds
sterling
independent
of
our
clothes
which
were
of
some
value
to
us
that
is
mine
were
at
all
events
the
seamen
who
guarded
us
and
who
relieved
each
other
every
watch
were
not
at
all
surly
or
i
asked
one
of
them
during
the
whether
he
thought
the
captain
would
take
our
lives
no
said
he
we
will
not
allow
that
you
may
be
pirates
as
he
says
although
we
do
not
think
you
are
but
if
pirates
you
shall
have
fair
play
that
we
have
all
made
up
our
minds
to
no
hanging
first
and
trying
afterwards
i
had
a
long
conversation
with
this
man
who
appeared
very
much
inclined
to
be
sociable
he
told
me
that
the
vessel
was
named
the
that
she
sailed
from
virginia
to
the
west
indies
and
that
some
times
she
went
to
england
that
the
captain
of
her
was
also
the
owner
but
where
he
came
from
or
what
he
was
they
did
not
know
except
that
he
was
a
virginian
they
believed
so
for
that
he
had
a
tobacco
estate
there
which
was
carried
on
by
his
eldest
son
he
called
the
captain
a
stingy
miserly
fellow
who
would
sacrifice
any
man
life
to
save
a
shilling
and
that
there
were
odd
stories
about
him
at
james
town
i
was
well
satisfied
with
my
conversation
with
this
man
as
it
assured
me
that
our
lives
would
not
be
taken
and
i
had
no
fear
of
the
result
upon
my
arrival
at
james
town
for
as
i
have
mentioned
before
mr
trevannion
had
vessels
which
sailed
to
that
port
and
i
well
recollected
the
names
of
the
parties
to
whom
the
vessel
and
cargo
were
consigned
on
the
following
day
the
captain
of
the
brig
followed
by
his
son
came
forward
and
looked
at
us
as
we
sat
in
irons
upon
which
i
addressed
him
you
have
put
me
in
irons
sir
when
i
threw
myself
upon
your
protection
you
have
robbed
us
of
our
money
to
the
amount
of
nearly
pounds
and
you
detain
our
other
property
i
now
again
desire
that
i
may
be
released
i
offered
to
convince
you
that
i
was
a
person
of
property
but
you
refused
to
listen
to
me
now
sir
i
will
tell
you
that
i
am
a
partner
in
the
house
of
trevannion
at
liverpool
and
that
we
have
vessels
that
trade
between
james
town
and
that
port
our
vessels
are
consigned
to
fairbrother
and
wilcocks
of
james
town
and
on
my
arrival
i
will
soon
prove
that
to
you
and
also
not
only
make
you
surrender
the
property
you
have
robbed
us
of
but
i
will
make
you
smart
pretty
handsomely
for
your
treatment
of
us
that
you
may
depend
upon
fairbrother
and
wilcocks
muttered
he
confound
the
fellow
oh
said
he
turning
to
me
you
got
the
name
of
that
firm
from
some
ship
you
have
plundered
and
sunk
i
suppose
no
no
that
wo
do
old
birds
are
not
to
be
caught
with
chaff
i
believe
you
to
have
been
a
pirate
yourself
if
you
are
not
one
now
replied
i
at
all
events
you
are
a
thief
and
a
paltry
villain
but
our
time
will
come
yes
it
will
said
the
captain
of
the
xebeque
and
remember
you
scoundrel
if
you
can
escape
and
buy
off
justice
you
shall
not
escape
seven
portuguese
knives
mind
you
that
no
no
cried
the
portuguese
sailors
stop
till
we
are
on
shore
and
then
come
on
shore
if
you
dare
i
say
father
said
young
hopeful
this
looks
like
mischief
better
hang
them
i
reckon
than
to
be
stuck
like
pigs
they
look
as
if
do
it
do
they
i
shall
never
forget
the
diabolical
expression
of
the
captain
of
the
brig
after
the
portuguese
sailors
had
done
speaking
he
had
a
pistol
at
his
belt
which
he
drew
out
that
right
shoot
father
dead
men
tell
no
tales
as
you
have
always
said
no
no
said
the
seaman
who
was
on
guard
motioning
them
back
with
his
cutlass
there
will
be
no
shooting
nor
hanging
either
we
are
all
sworn
to
that
if
so
be
they
be
pirates
there
the
law
of
the
country
to
condemn
them
and
if
they
be
not
pirates
why
then
that
another
story
the
captain
looked
at
the
seaman
as
if
he
could
have
shot
him
if
he
dared
then
turned
round
hastily
and
went
back
to
the
cabin
followed
by
his
worthy
offspring
for
seven
days
we
remained
in
irons
when
we
heard
land
announced
by
the
sailors
on
deck
and
the
brig
head
was
put
towards
it
at
night
she
was
and
the
next
morning
again
stood
in
and
we
perceived
that
we
were
in
smooth
water
towards
night
the
anchor
was
let
go
and
we
asked
the
guard
if
we
had
arrived
at
james
town
he
replied
no
but
we
were
in
a
river
on
the
coast
but
he
did
not
know
what
river
it
was
nor
did
any
of
the
crew
nor
could
they
tell
why
the
captain
had
anchored
there
but
they
had
seen
several
canoes
with
indians
cross
the
river
but
that
there
appeared
to
be
no
white
settlement
that
they
could
discover
the
mystery
was
however
cleared
up
on
the
following
morning
a
small
boat
which
could
barely
hold
eight
people
was
lowered
from
the
stern
and
hauled
up
alongside
we
were
taken
up
one
by
one
the
scoundrel
of
a
captain
having
first
stripped
each
of
us
to
our
trousers
not
even
allowing
us
a
shirt
we
were
ordered
to
get
into
the
boat
as
soon
as
we
were
all
in
and
our
weight
brought
the
boat
down
to
her
gunnel
two
oars
were
handed
to
us
and
then
the
captain
of
the
brig
said
now
you
rascally
pirates
i
might
have
hanged
you
all
and
i
would
have
done
so
for
i
know
you
well
i
recollect
your
faces
when
you
plundered
the
when
i
was
off
porto
rico
but
if
i
put
you
in
prison
at
james
town
i
shall
have
to
wait
two
or
three
months
until
the
court
sits
and
i
can
not
be
detained
for
such
scoundrels
as
you
so
now
you
may
pull
on
shore
and
get
on
how
you
can
shove
off
directly
or
i
put
a
bullet
through
your
brains
hold
fast
cried
i
and
let
him
fire
if
he
dares
you
men
belonging
to
the
i
call
you
to
witness
this
treatment
your
captain
has
robbed
us
of
a
large
sum
of
money
and
now
turns
us
adrift
so
as
to
compel
us
to
land
among
savages
who
may
kill
us
immediately
i
appeal
to
you
will
you
permit
this
cruelty
and
injustice
if
you
are
english
i
conceive
you
will
not
there
was
some
talk
and
expostulation
with
the
captain
of
the
brig
in
consequence
of
what
i
said
but
while
it
was
going
on
the
captain
son
leaned
over
the
side
and
with
his
knife
cut
the
painter
or
rope
which
held
the
boat
and
as
the
tide
was
running
on
very
strong
in
less
than
half
a
minute
we
were
a
long
way
astern
of
the
brig
and
drifting
fast
up
the
river
we
got
our
oars
and
attempted
to
pull
for
the
brig
for
we
knew
that
the
seamen
were
taking
our
parts
but
it
was
in
vain
the
tide
ran
several
miles
an
hour
and
in
another
minute
or
two
with
all
our
exertions
we
were
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
mile
astern
of
her
and
the
boat
was
so
loaded
that
we
hardly
dared
move
lest
we
should
upset
it
we
had
therefore
no
option
but
to
go
on
shore
and
take
our
chance
but
when
the
men
were
pulling
round
for
the
shore
on
reflection
i
thought
that
we
had
better
not
land
so
soon
as
the
sailors
had
told
us
that
they
had
seen
the
indians
in
their
canoes
i
therefore
recommended
that
we
should
allow
the
boat
to
drift
up
the
river
with
the
tide
and
then
drift
down
again
when
the
tide
turned
remaining
in
the
middle
of
the
stream
till
it
was
dark
when
we
would
land
and
make
our
way
into
the
woods
my
advice
was
followed
we
sat
still
in
the
boat
just
keeping
her
head
to
the
stream
with
the
oars
and
being
without
our
shirts
the
sun
scorching
and
blistering
our
backs
till
past
noon
during
which
time
we
must
have
drifted
nearly
twenty
miles
up
the
river
which
was
as
broad
as
the
arm
of
a
sea
at
the
entrance
then
the
tide
turned
and
we
drifted
back
again
till
it
was
dusk
when
it
was
again
slack
water
all
this
while
we
kept
a
sharp
to
see
if
we
could
perceive
any
indians
but
not
one
was
to
be
seen
i
now
proposed
that
we
should
take
our
oars
and
pull
out
of
the
river
as
if
we
had
only
gone
up
on
a
survey
for
the
brig
had
got
under
weigh
and
had
anchored
for
want
of
wind
about
four
miles
off
and
the
indians
if
there
were
any
would
suppose
that
we
were
returning
to
the
ship
we
did
so
and
pulled
till
it
was
dark
and
were
within
two
miles
of
the
brig
where
the
again
made
strong
when
we
turned
the
boat
head
up
the
river
and
pulled
with
the
oars
to
get
up
as
far
as
we
could
before
we
landed
this
we
did
suffering
much
from
hunger
and
thirst
as
well
as
being
confined
so
long
in
one
position
as
my
knee
was
quite
well
i
now
took
off
the
bandage
and
hung
my
diamond
round
my
neck
as
before
i
could
not
help
feeling
a
satisfaction
when
i
thought
that
the
thief
of
a
captain
little
imagined
what
a
mine
of
wealth
he
was
losing
when
he
turned
me
adrift
it
was
about
midnight
when
the
tide
ceased
to
flow
and
we
then
agreed
to
land
and
the
question
then
was
whether
we
should
separate
or
keep
together
after
some
discussion
we
agreed
to
separate
in
twos
and
the
portuguese
captain
and
i
agreed
to
keep
each
other
company
we
first
pushed
the
boat
into
the
stream
that
she
might
drift
away
and
then
shaking
each
other
by
the
hand
and
bidding
adieu
we
all
started
in
different
directions
for
some
time
the
captain
and
i
threaded
the
woods
in
silence
when
we
were
stopped
by
a
stream
of
deep
water
with
such
high
banks
that
in
the
dark
we
did
not
know
how
to
cross
it
we
walked
by
the
side
of
it
for
some
time
to
discover
a
passage
and
in
so
doing
we
at
last
found
ourselves
again
on
the
banks
of
the
river
and
our
boat
lying
close
to
us
having
grounded
not
far
from
where
we
had
shoved
her
off
we
tasted
the
water
in
the
creek
and
found
it
quite
fresh
we
had
several
times
tried
it
on
the
river
and
found
it
quite
salt
from
the
tide
running
in
we
drank
plentifully
and
sat
down
to
recover
ourselves
for
although
we
had
not
walked
more
than
half
an
hour
the
pushing
through
the
was
very
fatiguing
i
think
said
i
that
this
boat
will
certainly
betray
us
and
would
it
not
be
better
to
take
possession
of
it
again
it
will
hold
two
comfortably
and
i
think
we
shall
get
on
as
well
if
not
better
in
a
boat
than
in
the
woods
without
compass
and
without
guide
i
agree
with
you
said
the
captain
but
what
shall
we
do
let
us
retrace
our
steps
let
us
pull
again
with
the
for
the
mouth
of
the
river
and
then
coast
it
along
shore
we
may
arrive
at
some
settlement
if
we
do
not
starve
by
the
way
i
agree
with
you
he
said
it
will
be
the
best
plan
we
must
conceal
ourselves
in
the
day
and
coast
along
at
night
we
waded
into
the
river
got
into
the
boat
and
again
pulled
out
the
boat
being
light
now
pulled
well
and
we
made
good
speed
and
at
daylight
we
were
clear
of
the
river
and
close
to
a
small
island
near
the
mouth
of
it
upon
this
we
agreed
to
land
to
try
if
we
could
procure
food
for
we
were
much
exhausted
and
also
to
conceal
ourselves
from
the
natives
we
ran
our
little
boat
on
shore
and
concealed
her
among
some
bushes
which
grew
down
at
the
water
edge
we
looked
well
round
but
could
see
nothing
and
we
then
walked
out
in
search
of
food
we
found
some
wild
plums
which
we
eagerly
devoured
and
going
down
again
to
the
beach
where
there
were
some
rocks
we
found
of
which
we
broke
the
shells
between
two
stones
and
made
a
meal
of
after
our
hunger
was
satisfied
we
lay
down
under
the
shelter
of
the
boat
and
fell
fast
asleep
we
were
so
tired
that
we
did
not
wake
up
till
it
was
nearly
dark
when
we
agreed
to
start
again
and
pull
along
the
coast
to
the
northward
we
were
just
launching
our
boat
when
we
perceived
a
canoe
about
three
miles
off
steering
for
the
mouth
of
the
river
to
the
island
this
stopped
us
and
we
remained
in
our
the
canoe
approached
steering
directly
for
the
spot
where
we
lay
concealed
and
we
imagined
that
they
had
discovered
us
such
however
proved
not
to
be
the
case
for
they
ran
on
shore
about
fifty
yards
from
us
and
hauling
up
the
canoe
they
got
out
and
walked
away
on
land
there
were
four
men
but
it
was
now
too
dark
to
distinguish
any
more
we
remained
quiet
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
when
i
proposed
that
we
should
embark
have
you
ever
managed
a
canoe
said
the
portuguese
captain
to
me
i
have
been
in
one
in
africa
very
often
i
said
but
they
are
as
we
call
them
so
have
i
and
i
do
not
think
there
is
so
difference
between
them
and
these
canoes
can
you
paddle
yes
i
replied
so
can
i
he
said
now
observe
the
best
thing
we
can
do
is
to
take
possession
of
that
canoe
and
then
we
shall
get
on
better
for
our
boat
will
always
attract
notice
whereas
a
canoe
will
not
besides
it
will
prevent
these
indians
if
they
are
come
to
look
for
us
which
i
suspect
they
have
from
following
us
i
think
you
are
right
i
said
but
how
shall
we
manage
in
this
way
you
shall
shove
off
our
boat
and
walk
by
its
side
dragging
it
up
to
where
the
canoe
lies
i
will
go
to
the
canoe
launch
it
and
then
we
will
make
off
with
both
till
we
are
too
far
out
to
be
taken
then
when
we
have
got
into
the
canoe
we
will
turn
our
boat
adrift
i
agreed
to
the
proposals
we
launched
our
boat
very
quietly
and
i
walked
in
the
water
up
to
my
knees
drawing
it
after
me
till
i
arrived
opposite
to
the
canoe
the
portuguese
crept
on
his
hands
and
knees
till
he
had
gained
the
canoe
pushed
her
off
and
joined
me
we
made
her
fast
to
the
of
our
own
boat
then
got
into
the
boat
and
pulled
away
from
the
island
we
had
not
gained
more
than
a
hundred
yards
when
the
whiz
of
an
arrow
met
our
ears
the
indians
had
discovered
us
it
was
evident
two
or
three
more
arrows
came
flying
by
us
but
we
had
now
got
well
out
and
they
fell
harmless
we
continued
to
pull
till
we
were
half
a
mile
from
the
island
and
then
we
laid
on
our
oars
the
stars
shone
bright
there
was
a
young
moon
so
as
to
enable
us
to
see
pretty
well
we
found
the
paddles
of
the
canoe
lying
on
the
we
had
nothing
to
take
from
the
boat
but
our
and
the
two
small
oars
these
we
put
into
the
canoe
and
then
getting
in
ourselves
we
let
the
boat
go
adrift
we
put
her
head
to
the
northward
between
the
island
and
the
main
and
paddled
away
as
fast
as
we
could
the
captain
was
a
much
better
hand
than
i
was
and
he
therefore
took
the
office
of
steersman
the
water
was
as
smooth
as
glass
and
we
made
rapid
progress
and
did
not
discontinue
our
exertions
except
now
and
then
resting
for
a
few
moments
till
the
morning
dawned
when
we
could
hardly
distinguish
the
island
we
had
left
and
found
ourselves
about
five
miles
from
the
mainland
we
had
now
time
to
examine
the
contents
of
the
canoe
and
had
much
reason
to
be
gratified
with
our
acquisition
it
had
three
at
the
bottom
several
pounds
of
yams
cooked
and
uncooked
two
calabashes
full
of
water
bows
and
arrows
three
spears
a
tomahawk
three
and
hooks
and
some
little
gourds
full
of
black
white
and
red
paint
and
what
we
prized
more
than
all
some
flints
and
a
large
rusty
nail
with
rotten
wood
to
serve
as
tinder
we
are
fortunate
said
the
captain
now
before
we
pull
in
for
the
shore
we
must
paint
ourselves
like
indians
at
all
events
you
must
black
yourself
as
you
have
no
shirt
and
i
must
do
the
same
although
i
do
not
require
it
so
much
as
you
do
let
us
have
something
to
eat
and
drink
first
replied
i
and
we
will
proceed
to
our
toilet
afterwards
chapter
seventeen
my
adventures
with
the
indians
with
what
happened
to
the
portuguese
captain
my
companion
having
eaten
some
venison
and
drunk
out
of
the
calabash
the
captain
painted
me
black
with
here
and
there
a
line
of
red
and
white
on
the
face
and
shoulders
i
performed
the
same
duty
towards
him
and
we
then
resumed
our
paddles
and
pushed
in
a
slanting
direction
for
the
shore
the
tide
now
ran
down
against
us
and
we
could
hardly
stem
it
and
finding
ourselves
opposite
a
beach
clear
of
trees
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile
we
agreed
to
run
on
shore
to
look
for
a
large
stone
we
soon
found
one
which
answered
our
purpose
and
paddling
off
again
to
three
or
four
hundred
yards
we
made
the
stone
fast
to
the
of
our
boat
and
anchored
the
canoe
with
it
having
succeeded
in
this
we
got
out
the
and
with
a
piece
of
raw
meat
as
a
bait
we
soon
had
several
fish
in
the
canoe
after
which
we
put
on
no
more
baits
but
pretended
to
fish
till
the
tide
slacked
when
we
lifted
our
anchor
and
recommenced
our
paddling
to
the
northward
at
night
we
landed
on
a
rock
close
to
the
beach
having
well
reconnoitred
before
it
was
dark
to
see
if
there
were
any
canoes
or
indians
to
be
seen
on
the
shore
and
thus
we
continued
for
five
days
during
which
we
passed
the
mouths
of
one
or
two
rivers
and
had
gained
as
we
supposed
more
that
miles
along
the
coast
but
how
much
to
the
northward
we
could
not
tell
as
we
followed
the
windings
of
the
shore
we
were
twice
obliged
to
land
to
obtain
water
but
we
always
did
so
in
the
daytime
having
taken
the
precaution
to
black
the
whole
of
our
bodies
and
take
off
our
trousers
before
we
landed
our
deer
flesh
was
all
gone
and
we
continued
to
live
on
fish
cooking
as
much
as
we
could
at
one
time
the
collecting
was
the
great
risk
which
we
ran
for
we
were
then
obliged
to
land
where
there
was
wood
it
was
on
the
sixth
day
that
we
were
first
in
danger
as
we
rounded
a
point
we
fell
in
with
another
canoe
with
six
or
seven
people
in
it
they
were
not
more
than
yards
off
when
we
first
saw
them
the
indians
stood
up
in
the
canoe
looked
at
us
very
earnestly
and
then
perceiving
that
we
were
not
of
their
tribe
i
presume
pulled
towards
us
we
immediately
turned
and
pulled
away
they
had
been
fishing
and
two
of
them
were
pulling
up
the
lines
while
the
others
paddled
which
gave
us
a
little
advantage
but
they
had
three
paddles
and
we
had
only
two
they
shouted
and
paddled
with
all
their
might
but
they
gained
little
as
they
were
seven
in
the
canoe
five
men
and
two
women
and
deep
in
consequence
as
they
gained
slowly
upon
us
notwithstanding
all
our
exertions
the
portuguese
said
to
me
they
have
no
weapons
in
the
boat
i
should
think
if
they
had
they
would
use
them
for
we
are
within
can
you
use
a
bow
and
arrow
i
could
once
replied
i
use
it
very
fairly
for
when
i
was
captive
with
whyna
she
would
often
practise
the
bow
and
arrow
with
me
and
i
became
somewhat
expert
before
i
left
her
well
then
said
he
let
me
paddle
on
and
do
you
put
an
arrow
in
the
bow
and
threaten
them
at
all
events
i
did
so
and
stood
up
taking
aim
as
if
about
to
shoot
at
which
they
ceased
paddling
and
after
talking
a
little
they
turned
the
head
of
their
canoe
round
and
made
for
the
shore
we
proceeded
as
may
be
imagined
with
all
diligence
i
laid
down
my
bow
and
arrows
and
resumed
my
paddle
and
in
an
hour
we
could
no
longer
see
our
late
pursuers
we
continued
our
voyage
and
for
three
days
met
with
no
further
adventures
when
about
noon
on
the
fourth
day
the
sky
became
overcast
and
there
was
every
prospect
of
rough
weather
before
night
the
wind
and
sea
rose
and
it
was
no
longer
possible
for
us
to
keep
along
the
coast
which
already
was
covered
with
breakers
we
had
therefore
no
remedy
but
to
make
for
the
shore
and
haul
up
the
canoe
for
we
could
not
perceive
any
inlet
which
might
shelter
us
it
was
quite
dark
when
we
dashed
the
canoe
through
the
breakers
and
landed
we
hauled
her
up
some
distance
as
there
was
every
appearance
of
worse
weather
and
sheltered
ourselves
under
the
lee
of
a
high
rock
the
wind
now
blew
fiercely
and
rain
descended
in
torrents
we
tried
to
light
a
fire
to
warm
ourselves
but
could
not
succeed
so
we
lay
down
on
one
and
covered
ourselves
with
the
others
waiting
impatiently
for
daylight
when
the
day
dawned
the
weather
was
worse
than
ever
we
now
looked
out
for
a
better
place
of
concealment
for
ourselves
and
our
canoe
and
found
one
at
about
fifty
yards
distance
between
two
high
rocks
there
was
a
narrow
cleft
or
passage
which
was
large
enough
for
us
and
for
the
canoe
and
this
hid
us
both
from
the
storm
and
from
the
sea
into
this
cleft
we
hauled
our
canoe
and
withdrew
ourselves
making
a
meal
off
some
fish
we
roasted
on
the
embers
we
remained
there
for
two
days
when
the
weather
moderated
but
the
sea
was
still
too
rough
for
us
to
launch
the
canoe
so
we
decided
upon
remaining
one
day
more
although
our
provisions
were
all
gone
and
our
calabashes
quite
empty
on
the
third
day
to
our
great
surprise
and
alarm
we
heard
the
report
of
a
musket
not
far
from
us
from
this
we
knew
that
we
could
not
be
very
far
from
the
english
settlements
for
it
was
only
the
indians
near
to
the
settlements
who
had
obtained
muskets
but
whether
it
was
an
indian
or
a
white
man
who
fired
we
could
not
of
course
tell
i
recollected
that
in
the
last
advices
we
had
had
from
james
town
our
factors
had
stated
that
there
was
a
cruel
war
carried
on
between
the
indians
and
the
settlers
and
that
the
indians
had
ravaged
the
plantations
but
that
was
two
years
ago
and
how
it
might
be
now
it
was
impossible
to
tell
a
second
report
of
a
musket
still
nearer
induced
me
to
creep
along
by
the
side
of
the
rock
and
look
out
to
see
if
any
one
was
near
to
my
great
alarm
i
perceived
five
indians
with
muskets
not
a
hundred
yards
off
i
drew
back
as
i
hoped
unperceived
but
the
eye
of
an
indian
was
too
keen
they
had
discovered
me
and
whilst
i
was
relating
to
the
portuguese
captain
what
i
had
seen
they
were
suddenly
upon
us
we
had
no
time
to
make
resistance
even
if
we
were
inclined
so
to
do
we
therefore
sat
still
they
came
up
and
looked
at
us
the
wet
had
washed
off
a
great
portion
of
the
paint
upon
my
back
and
shoulders
one
of
the
indians
touched
me
on
the
shoulder
and
said
ugh
white
man
paint
like
indian
they
then
examined
the
canoe
and
its
contents
and
having
spoken
a
few
words
to
each
other
apparently
relating
to
the
canoe
they
put
a
thong
of
leather
round
each
of
our
arms
and
making
a
motion
for
us
to
follow
them
they
led
us
away
we
done
our
best
and
could
do
no
more
said
the
portuguese
i
feel
that
it
all
over
with
me
now
and
i
shall
soon
sleep
in
the
bosom
of
jesus
my
heart
was
too
full
to
make
any
reply
the
indians
led
on
and
i
followed
in
silence
we
passed
through
the
woods
which
appeared
to
be
interminable
till
the
night
closed
in
and
then
the
indians
halted
and
while
one
remained
as
guard
over
us
the
others
collected
wood
for
a
fire
they
had
some
provisions
but
offered
none
to
us
after
an
hour
they
lay
down
to
sleep
round
the
fire
placing
me
and
the
portuguese
captain
next
to
the
fire
and
lying
outside
of
us
they
were
soon
fast
asleep
or
appeared
to
be
when
i
said
to
the
captain
have
you
your
knife
for
if
they
remain
asleep
let
us
wait
an
hour
or
so
and
if
you
can
cut
the
leather
thong
which
the
indian
holds
in
his
hand
and
then
watch
your
opportunity
i
will
do
the
same
and
we
may
escape
i
have
my
knife
but
my
indian
is
not
asleep
replied
he
i
will
wait
till
he
is
what
signal
shall
we
make
if
we
succeed
said
i
when
you
are
ready
lift
your
arm
up
i
shall
understand
and
if
i
am
ready
i
will
do
the
same
agreed
and
now
let
us
be
quiet
for
depend
upon
it
our
conversation
has
roused
them
all
we
then
composed
ourselves
as
if
to
sleep
and
remained
in
that
way
for
more
than
an
hour
by
which
time
we
were
convinced
that
our
captors
were
slumbering
i
then
drew
out
my
knife
for
the
indians
had
not
attempted
to
rifle
us
and
cut
the
thong
which
was
round
my
arm
without
awaking
the
indian
who
had
the
other
end
in
his
hand
i
remained
quiet
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
when
the
portuguese
lifted
up
his
arm
as
a
signal
that
he
was
free
i
listened
attentively
and
being
certain
that
the
indians
were
asleep
i
lifted
up
my
arm
also
the
portuguese
then
rose
up
carefully
and
without
noise
stepping
past
the
bodies
of
the
indians
till
he
was
clear
of
the
circle
i
did
the
same
and
pointed
to
the
muskets
which
lay
on
the
grass
by
the
indians
he
took
one
up
and
i
another
and
we
retreated
to
a
short
distance
we
must
have
the
other
muskets
said
i
stay
where
you
are
i
advanced
cautiously
and
took
up
the
other
three
muskets
and
was
retreating
with
them
when
one
of
the
indians
turned
round
as
if
awaking
i
ran
past
the
portuguese
and
making
a
sign
for
him
to
follow
me
we
retreated
a
few
yards
into
the
wood
where
we
could
watch
the
indians
without
being
seen
ourselves
the
portuguese
motioned
to
be
off
but
i
detained
him
and
i
was
right
the
indian
roused
up
and
sat
upon
his
haunches
perceiving
that
we
had
escaped
he
waked
up
the
others
they
started
on
their
feet
and
looking
round
found
that
the
muskets
were
all
gone
and
then
they
held
a
consultation
at
last
they
appeared
to
have
made
up
their
minds
to
follow
and
if
possible
recapture
us
for
they
went
back
in
the
direction
of
the
sea
now
then
we
must
hide
three
of
the
muskets
said
i
in
a
whisper
and
keep
the
others
to
defend
ourselves
we
examined
and
found
that
they
were
all
loaded
and
the
portuguese
then
said
to
me
there
are
five
of
them
if
they
meet
with
us
and
we
discharge
two
muskets
and
we
do
not
kill
we
shall
be
at
their
mercy
if
we
do
kill
still
there
will
be
three
against
two
we
had
better
carry
all
the
muskets
do
you
take
two
and
i
will
take
three
as
i
thought
he
was
right
i
consented
and
we
now
went
the
same
path
towards
the
sea
which
the
indians
had
done
before
us
in
pursuit
of
us
we
walked
fast
as
we
knew
the
indians
would
do
the
same
and
they
had
the
start
of
us
so
that
we
were
not
likely
to
come
up
with
them
it
was
severe
work
but
we
did
not
slacken
our
pace
and
before
dawn
the
sea
was
quite
visible
through
the
branches
of
the
trees
for
we
had
arrived
at
the
outskirts
of
the
wood
as
soon
as
we
had
gained
the
beach
which
was
yards
wide
we
looked
round
to
see
if
we
could
perceive
the
indians
but
we
could
observe
nobody
let
us
while
it
is
yet
dark
go
round
so
as
to
get
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
rocks
where
we
were
concealed
said
the
portuguese
if
they
are
there
we
shall
take
them
by
surprise
keeping
just
within
the
wood
we
walked
half
a
mile
to
the
southward
and
then
emerged
just
as
the
day
was
breaking
and
made
for
the
rocks
as
soon
as
we
arrived
we
examined
very
cautiously
before
we
entered
the
cleft
but
there
was
nobody
there
and
the
canoe
was
safe
they
are
not
here
said
i
where
can
they
be
they
can
not
be
far
off
said
the
portuguese
i
suspect
they
are
hidden
somewhere
and
intend
to
surprise
us
while
we
are
launching
our
canoe
and
when
our
muskets
will
be
out
of
our
hands
i
agree
with
you
let
us
now
wait
at
some
little
distance
from
the
rocks
till
broad
daylight
we
shall
then
be
secure
from
surprise
we
did
so
and
when
the
sun
rose
we
looked
well
round
but
could
see
nobody
we
entered
the
cleft
and
were
about
to
lay
down
the
muskets
and
lay
hold
of
the
canoe
when
i
perceived
a
small
piece
of
rock
to
drop
down
this
caused
me
immediately
to
suspect
the
truth
and
i
cried
to
the
portuguese
to
come
back
with
me
he
did
so
and
i
told
him
that
i
was
certain
that
the
indians
had
climbed
the
rock
and
were
lying
down
on
the
top
of
it
ready
to
pounce
upon
us
depend
upon
it
they
must
be
there
said
he
when
i
mentioned
the
falling
piece
of
rock
let
us
walk
round
and
see
if
we
can
discover
them
we
did
so
but
they
were
too
well
concealed
but
what
must
be
done
now
said
he
it
is
useless
our
attempting
to
clamber
to
the
top
of
the
rock
for
no
one
could
do
it
with
a
musket
in
his
hand
no
replied
i
that
is
certain
and
if
we
attempt
to
bring
the
canoe
out
of
the
cleft
they
may
drop
down
upon
us
i
think
said
he
that
if
we
were
to
go
in
and
take
the
in
our
hands
which
is
several
yards
long
we
might
haul
out
the
canoe
by
it
and
when
once
it
is
clear
of
the
cleft
they
can
not
move
without
our
seeing
them
we
will
try
at
all
events
replied
i
do
you
stay
on
the
watch
while
i
get
hold
of
the
and
bring
it
out
the
indians
did
not
expect
this
manoeuvre
it
was
clear
still
keeping
the
muskets
in
our
possession
the
butts
on
the
sand
and
the
muzzles
resting
on
our
shoulders
we
laid
hold
of
the
and
by
great
exertion
hauled
the
canoe
several
yards
away
from
between
the
two
rocks
we
then
paused
for
breath
after
a
minute
or
two
with
our
eyes
fixed
upon
the
top
of
the
rock
to
see
if
they
moved
and
then
we
hauled
it
at
least
a
hundred
yards
further
on
when
for
the
first
time
i
perceived
that
the
bow
and
arrows
were
not
in
the
canoe
and
that
they
must
have
been
taken
by
the
indians
then
we
must
haul
again
said
the
portuguese
when
i
stated
this
to
him
till
we
are
out
of
let
us
put
the
muskets
into
the
canoe
and
drag
it
as
fast
as
we
can
we
did
so
and
gained
another
hundred
yards
before
we
stopped
when
an
arrow
was
discharged
from
the
summit
of
the
rock
and
buried
itself
in
the
sand
close
to
my
feet
haul
again
said
the
portuguese
we
are
not
out
of
shot
yet
again
we
exerted
ourselves
and
gained
another
hundred
yards
during
which
two
more
arrows
were
discharged
and
one
of
them
went
through
the
left
arm
of
my
comrade
but
as
it
was
through
the
fleshy
part
and
did
not
touch
the
bone
it
did
not
disable
him
a
third
arrow
was
sent
after
us
but
did
not
reach
us
and
we
knew
that
we
were
out
of
distance
cut
the
shaft
of
the
arrow
and
draw
it
through
the
arm
said
the
portuguese
not
now
said
i
they
will
perceive
me
doing
so
and
will
think
that
you
are
disabled
that
may
induce
them
to
rush
upon
us
thinking
they
have
only
one
man
to
deal
with
well
it
no
great
matter
replied
he
we
must
now
drag
our
canoe
down
to
the
water
and
launch
her
if
they
will
let
us
we
have
outwitted
them
so
far
we
now
turned
the
head
of
the
canoe
towards
the
sea
and
slowly
dragged
her
down
our
eyes
as
may
be
supposed
constantly
kept
upon
the
rock
to
see
if
the
indians
would
move
but
they
did
not
they
perhaps
felt
that
they
had
no
chance
with
us
having
all
the
and
an
open
beach
in
our
favour
we
launched
our
canoe
without
further
interruption
on
their
part
and
in
a
few
minutes
taking
care
to
be
out
of
arrow
distance
we
passed
the
rock
with
our
head
to
the
northward
when
about
two
miles
off
we
perceived
the
indians
to
descend
from
the
rock
and
walk
away
into
the
woods
let
us
praise
god
for
this
miraculous
escape
said
i
to
the
portuguese
i
do
and
the
holy
patron
saint
who
has
preserved
me
replied
the
portuguese
captain
but
i
am
still
heavy
at
heart
i
feel
that
we
have
escaped
only
to
come
into
more
strange
and
fresh
calamity
i
shall
never
get
back
to
lisbon
that
i
feel
convinced
of
i
tried
all
i
could
to
encourage
him
but
it
was
of
no
avail
he
told
me
that
the
presentiment
was
too
strong
and
could
not
be
overcome
by
any
argument
indeed
he
appeared
to
have
allowed
the
idea
so
to
have
taken
possession
of
his
mind
that
his
reason
became
enervated
and
having
heard
how
the
indians
burnt
their
prisoners
he
talked
about
martyrdom
at
the
stake
and
rising
up
to
heaven
in
great
glory
there
to
be
received
by
the
whole
body
of
saints
and
legions
of
angels
what
is
the
use
of
our
thus
labouring
at
the
paddle
said
he
why
not
at
once
let
us
go
ashore
and
receive
the
crown
of
martyrdom
i
am
ready
for
i
long
for
the
hour
and
shall
rejoice
i
said
all
i
could
to
keep
him
quiet
but
it
was
useless
and
such
was
his
insanity
that
he
gradually
neared
the
shore
by
steering
against
me
with
his
paddle
so
that
i
could
not
prevent
it
i
had
drawn
the
shaft
of
the
arrow
through
his
arm
and
he
appeared
to
feel
no
pain
i
expostulated
with
him
at
his
keeping
the
canoe
so
near
the
shore
but
he
smiled
and
gave
no
reply
we
had
the
stream
against
us
and
made
but
little
way
and
it
vexed
me
very
much
to
hear
him
talk
so
loud
as
he
did
as
the
indians
must
have
heard
him
and
i
thought
would
follow
us
along
the
coast
but
he
ransacked
the
whole
book
of
martyrs
telling
me
how
one
had
his
body
sawn
in
two
another
was
pinched
to
death
this
one
burnt
that
tortured
every
variety
of
death
he
entered
upon
during
the
whole
of
that
day
without
ceasing
i
ascribed
much
of
this
to
the
pain
arising
from
the
wounded
arm
notwithstanding
which
he
paddled
with
as
much
vigour
as
ever
as
the
night
came
on
i
entreated
him
to
hold
his
tongue
but
it
was
in
vain
and
i
felt
assured
that
his
reason
was
quite
gone
he
continued
to
talk
loud
and
rave
without
intermission
and
i
now
considered
our
fate
as
sealed
we
had
no
water
in
the
boat
or
provisions
of
any
kind
and
i
proposed
that
we
should
and
catch
some
fish
telling
him
that
if
he
talked
we
should
scare
them
away
this
made
him
quiet
for
a
time
but
as
soon
as
we
had
hooked
four
or
five
fish
he
again
commenced
his
history
of
the
glorious
martyrs
i
prayed
him
to
be
silent
for
a
short
time
at
least
and
he
was
so
for
about
four
or
five
minutes
when
he
would
break
out
into
some
ejaculation
which
i
immediately
stopped
at
last
he
could
talk
no
more
for
want
of
water
his
lips
were
glued
together
and
so
were
mine
nevertheless
i
continued
paddling
for
two
hours
more
when
i
found
by
the
canoe
grounding
that
he
had
steered
her
on
the
beach
there
was
no
help
for
it
we
landed
and
went
in
search
of
water
which
we
found
about
half
of
a
mile
from
where
our
canoe
was
beached
we
drank
heartily
filled
the
calabash
and
were
returning
to
the
canoe
when
he
again
commenced
talking
as
loud
as
ever
i
was
in
great
anger
but
i
put
my
hand
before
his
mouth
beseeching
him
in
a
whisper
to
be
quiet
as
we
were
doing
this
we
were
suddenly
sprung
upon
and
seized
by
several
indians
and
in
a
minute
were
bound
hands
and
feet
i
knew
it
cried
the
portuguese
i
knew
it
would
be
so
well
i
am
prepared
are
not
you
my
good
friend
i
made
no
reply
i
felt
that
in
his
madness
he
had
sacrificed
his
own
life
and
mine
also
but
it
was
the
will
of
heaven
the
indians
left
two
to
guard
us
and
went
down
to
the
canoe
returning
with
their
muskets
i
soon
perceived
that
they
were
the
same
whom
we
had
escaped
from
the
night
before
and
the
one
who
had
spoken
a
little
english
when
we
were
first
captured
now
came
to
me
and
said
white
man
paint
like
indian
steal
gun
ugh
when
the
indians
had
returned
from
the
canoe
our
feet
were
unbound
and
we
were
again
led
away
by
the
leather
thong
which
was
fast
to
our
arms
the
portuguese
now
began
to
find
his
tongue
again
and
talked
incessantly
the
indians
not
checking
him
from
which
it
was
evident
that
they
were
on
their
own
domains
after
four
hours
walking
they
kindled
a
fire
and
went
to
repose
as
before
but
this
time
they
took
our
knives
from
us
and
bound
our
legs
so
tight
that
they
gave
us
much
pain
i
did
not
expostulate
as
i
knew
it
was
useless
my
companion
as
the
thong
entered
into
his
flesh
seemed
pleased
saying
now
my
martyrdom
is
commencing
alas
poor
man
but
i
will
not
anticipate
we
travelled
three
days
during
which
we
were
supplied
with
a
small
portion
of
parched
indian
corn
every
day
just
sufficient
for
our
sustenance
and
no
more
on
the
fourth
morning
the
indians
after
an
hour
travelling
set
up
some
shrill
and
barbarous
cries
which
i
afterwards
discovered
was
their
these
cries
were
replied
to
by
others
at
a
distance
and
in
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
afterwards
we
found
ourselves
close
to
a
number
of
wigwams
as
they
are
termed
the
indian
houses
and
soon
surrounded
by
a
large
party
of
men
women
and
children
who
greeted
us
with
taunts
and
menaces
we
were
led
into
a
larger
wigwam
than
the
others
where
we
found
several
indians
of
grave
aspect
assembled
and
a
man
who
could
speak
english
was
ordered
in
as
interpreter
he
asked
us
where
we
came
from
in
the
canoe
i
replied
that
we
came
from
the
south
but
we
had
been
wrecked
in
a
big
ship
and
had
taken
the
canoe
which
we
found
on
the
beach
they
asked
no
more
questions
we
were
led
out
and
in
about
an
hour
afterwards
the
indians
who
had
spoken
english
to
us
when
we
were
captured
came
up
with
two
others
and
painted
us
black
saying
the
white
men
like
paint
black
paint
good
i
did
not
know
till
afterwards
that
this
painting
black
was
a
sign
that
we
were
condemned
to
death
but
so
it
was
they
took
off
our
trousers
the
only
garment
we
had
on
and
left
us
naked
to
my
surprise
they
did
not
take
the
diamond
which
was
sewed
up
in
leather
from
off
my
neck
but
as
i
learnt
subsequently
the
indians
are
much
given
to
conjurors
and
charms
wearing
many
round
their
own
necks
and
about
their
persons
and
they
respect
the
charms
that
their
enemies
wear
indeed
are
afraid
of
them
lest
they
should
be
harmed
by
having
them
in
their
possession
we
remained
in
a
wigwam
during
that
day
with
guards
over
us
the
following
day
we
were
led
out
and
cast
loose
and
we
found
all
the
indians
women
and
children
ranged
in
two
lines
each
holding
in
their
hands
a
club
or
stick
or
rod
of
some
description
or
another
we
were
led
to
the
end
of
the
row
and
looked
about
us
in
amazement
they
made
signs
to
us
which
we
did
not
understand
and
while
we
were
remaining
in
doubt
as
to
what
was
to
be
our
fate
an
old
woman
who
had
been
menacing
and
grinning
at
me
for
some
time
and
who
was
the
most
hideous
animal
that
i
ever
beheld
in
the
shape
of
a
woman
thrust
a
straw
into
my
eye
giving
me
most
excruciating
agony
i
was
so
carried
away
by
rage
and
pain
that
i
saluted
her
with
a
kick
in
the
stomach
which
laid
her
doubled
up
on
the
ground
expecting
to
be
scalped
for
so
doing
the
next
moment
on
the
contrary
the
indians
laughed
while
some
of
the
other
women
dragged
her
away
at
last
the
interpreter
came
and
from
him
we
learnt
that
we
had
to
run
the
gauntlet
and
that
as
soon
as
we
gained
the
large
lodge
where
we
had
been
examined
by
the
old
indians
on
the
day
previous
we
were
safe
and
that
we
must
run
for
that
as
fast
as
we
could
the
portuguese
who
was
still
as
mad
as
ever
was
then
pushed
on
he
would
not
run
but
walked
glorying
in
the
blows
which
showered
down
upon
him
like
hail
and
moreover
he
prevented
me
from
running
for
some
time
till
i
got
past
him
i
had
been
cruelly
punished
and
was
mad
with
pain
when
i
perceived
a
tall
gaunt
indian
waiting
for
me
with
a
heavy
club
careless
of
life
or
consequences
i
rushed
past
him
and
as
i
passed
i
threw
out
my
fist
with
such
impetus
that
hitting
him
under
the
right
ear
he
fell
senseless
and
it
appears
that
he
never
rose
again
for
the
blow
killed
him
after
which
i
at
last
gained
the
and
was
soon
afterwards
followed
by
my
companion
who
was
streaming
with
blood
we
were
then
led
away
and
tied
by
our
necks
to
two
stakes
about
twenty
yards
apart
and
there
we
remained
for
the
night
the
portuguese
passed
the
night
in
singing
i
passed
it
in
silence
and
prayer
i
felt
convinced
that
we
were
to
die
and
i
feared
that
it
would
be
by
fire
or
torture
for
i
had
heard
something
of
the
manners
and
customs
of
these
indians
i
made
my
peace
with
god
as
well
as
a
poor
sinner
could
prayed
for
mercy
through
jesus
christ
sighed
my
adieu
to
amy
and
made
up
my
mind
to
die
early
the
next
morning
the
indians
brought
and
placed
it
in
bundles
round
the
stakes
at
a
distance
of
about
fourteen
yards
from
the
centre
they
then
went
to
the
portuguese
tied
his
hands
behind
him
and
exchanged
the
rope
by
which
he
had
been
fastened
for
a
much
stronger
one
one
end
of
which
they
fastened
to
his
wrists
behind
him
and
the
other
to
the
stake
as
they
left
me
as
i
was
before
it
was
plain
that
the
portuguese
was
to
suffer
first
they
then
set
fire
to
the
piles
of
wood
which
were
round
the
stake
which
were
too
far
from
him
to
burn
him
and
i
could
not
imagine
what
they
intended
to
do
but
you
may
conceive
that
i
was
in
a
state
of
awful
suspense
and
anxiety
as
i
was
well
convinced
that
his
fate
whatever
it
might
be
would
be
my
own
during
these
appalling
preparations
the
portuguese
appeared
as
if
he
really
enjoyed
the
scene
now
my
good
friend
said
he
to
me
you
shall
see
how
i
can
suffer
for
the
true
faith
even
a
heretic
like
you
shall
be
converted
by
my
example
and
i
shall
ascend
to
heaven
with
you
in
my
arms
come
on
ye
fiends
come
on
ye
heathens
and
see
how
a
christian
can
suffer
much
as
i
felt
for
him
and
for
myself
i
could
not
lament
that
his
reason
had
left
him
as
i
thought
his
sufferings
would
be
less
but
his
exclamations
were
soon
drowned
by
a
loud
yell
from
the
indians
who
all
rushed
upon
my
unfortunate
companion
for
a
moment
or
two
they
were
crowded
so
thick
round
him
that
i
could
not
perceive
what
they
were
doing
but
after
that
they
separated
and
i
beheld
him
bleeding
profusely
his
ears
and
nose
having
been
cut
off
and
a
broken
iron
ramrod
passed
through
both
cheeks
and
now
a
scene
took
place
at
the
remembrance
of
which
even
now
my
blood
curdles
some
caught
up
the
burning
sticks
and
applied
them
to
his
flesh
others
stuck
him
full
of
small
splints
the
ends
of
which
they
lighted
the
indian
warriors
shot
at
him
with
muskets
loaded
with
powder
only
so
as
to
burn
him
terribly
on
every
part
of
the
body
the
women
took
up
handfuls
of
lighted
ashes
and
showered
them
down
on
him
so
that
the
ground
he
trod
upon
was
a
mass
of
burning
embers
and
he
walked
upon
fire
irons
were
now
brought
forward
and
his
body
seared
in
all
parts
his
tormentors
seeking
out
where
they
could
give
him
the
most
pain
at
last
one
applied
the
hot
iron
to
his
eyes
and
burnt
them
out
imagine
my
feelings
at
this
horrid
scene
imagine
the
knowledge
that
this
was
to
be
also
my
fate
in
a
short
time
but
what
is
more
strange
to
tell
imagine
madam
my
companion
not
only
deriding
his
torturers
but
not
flinching
from
the
torture
on
the
contrary
praising
god
for
his
goodness
in
thus
allowing
him
to
be
a
martyr
for
the
true
faith
offering
his
body
to
their
inflictions
and
shouting
manfully
but
such
was
the
behaviour
of
my
insane
friend
and
this
behaviour
appeared
to
give
great
satisfaction
to
the
indians
for
nearly
two
hours
did
this
torture
continue
his
body
was
black
and
bloody
all
over
and
the
smell
of
the
burning
flesh
was
horrible
but
by
this
time
it
appeared
as
if
he
was
much
exhausted
and
indeed
appeared
to
be
almost
insensible
to
pain
he
walked
round
the
stake
as
before
upon
the
burning
coals
but
appeared
not
to
know
when
further
torture
was
applied
to
him
or
not
he
now
sang
hymns
in
portuguese
in
a
low
voice
for
he
was
much
exhausted
soon
afterwards
he
staggered
and
fell
down
with
his
face
upon
the
burning
embers
but
even
the
flesh
of
his
face
grilling
as
it
were
appeared
to
have
no
effect
upon
him
an
indian
then
went
up
to
him
and
with
his
knife
cut
a
circle
round
his
head
and
tore
off
the
whole
scalp
flesh
and
hair
together
and
when
he
had
done
this
the
old
woman
whom
i
had
saluted
with
a
kick
before
i
ran
the
gauntlet
and
who
had
his
ears
hanging
on
her
neck
to
a
string
lifted
up
a
handful
of
burning
coals
and
put
them
upon
his
bleeding
head
this
seemed
to
rouse
him
he
lifted
up
his
head
but
his
features
were
no
longer
to
be
distinguished
as
his
face
was
burnt
to
a
black
coal
and
he
said
take
me
ye
holy
saints
angels
receive
me
and
to
my
great
astonishment
he
again
rose
on
his
legs
and
tottered
round
and
round
for
a
few
minutes
at
last
he
sank
down
with
his
back
against
the
stake
and
one
of
the
indians
cleaved
his
brain
with
his
tomahawk
and
thus
ended
the
life
and
the
misery
of
my
unfortunate
companion
and
it
was
now
my
turn
well
thought
i
it
is
but
two
hours
of
suffering
and
then
i
shall
be
beyond
their
malice
may
god
have
mercy
upon
my
soul
the
same
preparations
were
now
made
for
me
i
was
fastened
with
the
stout
rope
and
my
arms
tied
behind
me
the
wood
was
fired
and
one
of
the
chiefs
was
haranguing
the
indians
he
finished
the
low
yell
was
given
when
the
old
woman
whom
i
had
before
mentioned
ran
up
to
me
and
saying
something
which
i
could
not
understand
put
her
hand
upon
me
when
she
did
this
the
other
indians
who
were
about
to
rush
on
me
drew
back
with
signs
of
disappointment
on
many
of
their
wild
countenances
the
chiefs
then
went
into
the
leaving
me
tied
where
i
was
and
the
wood
burning
around
me
the
mass
of
indians
standing
about
as
if
waiting
the
decision
of
the
chiefs
after
a
time
three
indians
one
of
whom
was
the
interpreter
came
up
to
me
and
kicking
aside
the
burning
poles
cast
me
loose
i
asked
the
interpreter
what
he
was
about
to
do
he
replied
you
kill
indian
here
pointing
to
his
own
ear
you
kill
him
dead
squaw
lose
husband
want
another
take
you
stead
of
him
they
led
me
to
the
before
the
chiefs
the
old
woman
whom
i
had
kicked
was
there
it
was
her
husband
that
i
had
killed
by
the
blow
behind
the
ear
and
she
had
claimed
me
in
his
stead
and
according
to
the
custom
of
the
country
her
claim
was
allowed
and
i
was
made
over
to
her
and
received
into
the
tribe
strange
custom
for
a
woman
to
marry
the
murderer
of
her
husband
but
still
such
it
was
and
thus
did
i
find
myself
freed
from
the
stake
when
i
least
expected
it
the
principal
chief
made
me
a
speech
which
was
interpreted
in
which
he
told
me
that
i
was
now
the
husband
of
manou
and
was
one
of
their
own
tribe
that
i
must
be
strong
in
war
and
must
hunt
and
procure
venison
for
my
family
they
then
washed
off
the
black
paint
and
after
a
few
more
speeches
and
ceremonies
i
was
handed
over
to
the
hideous
old
hag
whose
neck
was
still
decorated
with
the
two
ears
of
my
companion
to
say
that
i
would
have
preferred
the
torture
would
be
saying
too
much
but
that
i
loathed
the
creature
to
excess
was
certain
however
i
said
nothing
but
allowed
her
to
take
me
by
the
hand
and
lead
me
to
her
wigwam
as
soon
as
we
were
in
she
brought
me
some
venison
which
i
ate
greedily
for
i
had
had
nothing
for
hours
she
then
offered
me
the
leggings
as
they
call
them
which
the
indians
wear
and
the
other
portions
of
the
indian
dress
which
probably
belonged
to
her
late
husband
i
put
them
on
as
i
was
glad
to
cover
my
nakedness
and
worn
out
with
walking
and
exertion
i
first
thanked
god
for
my
miraculous
preservation
and
then
lay
down
and
fell
into
a
deep
sleep
it
was
not
until
the
next
day
that
i
awoke
and
i
then
perceived
the
old
woman
rubbing
oil
upon
the
deep
cuts
made
in
my
wrists
and
shoulders
by
the
leather
thongs
she
again
set
meat
before
me
and
i
ate
heartily
but
i
looked
upon
her
with
abhorrence
and
when
she
attempted
to
fondle
me
i
turned
away
and
spit
with
disgust
at
which
she
retired
grumbling
i
now
had
leisure
to
reflect
i
passed
over
with
a
shudder
the
scenes
that
had
passed
and
again
returned
thanks
to
god
for
my
deliverance
i
called
to
mind
how
often
i
had
been
preserved
and
delivered
from
my
bondage
in
africa
from
my
imprisonment
in
the
tower
from
my
hopeless
slavery
in
the
mines
from
our
wreck
on
the
island
and
now
after
passing
through
such
dangers
from
an
almost
certain
cruel
death
by
torture
truly
did
i
feel
how
grateful
i
ought
to
be
for
that
providence
which
had
often
preserved
me
and
that
my
only
reliance
in
future
must
be
in
its
gracious
protection
but
here
i
was
married
to
a
woman
i
detested
and
living
with
barbarians
and
i
said
to
myself
that
kind
heaven
which
has
already
done
so
much
for
me
will
in
its
own
good
time
also
release
me
from
this
thraldom
in
the
mean
while
let
me
not
murmur
but
be
thankful
my
squaw
as
they
call
their
wives
among
the
indians
now
came
up
to
me
and
offered
to
paint
me
and
i
thought
it
advisable
that
she
should
as
i
felt
that
the
sooner
i
conformed
myself
to
their
customs
the
more
chance
i
had
of
making
my
escape
which
i
was
resolved
to
do
the
first
opportunity
as
soon
as
she
had
completed
my
toilet
i
walked
out
of
the
wigwam
that
i
might
look
about
me
and
be
seen
the
indians
who
were
sauntering
about
met
me
with
a
friendly
ugh
which
appeared
a
favourite
monosyllable
with
them
at
last
i
met
with
the
interpreter
and
began
to
converse
with
him
i
asked
what
nation
i
was
now
belonging
to
and
he
said
the
massowomicks
i
asked
how
large
their
country
was
and
he
told
me
much
which
i
could
not
understand
except
that
it
appeared
to
me
a
very
powerful
nation
i
was
very
careful
of
mentioning
the
english
or
anything
about
their
settlement
although
i
was
anxious
to
know
where
it
was
but
i
asked
him
whether
they
were
at
war
with
any
other
nation
he
said
no
they
had
been
at
war
with
other
tribes
but
that
they
had
all
made
peace
that
they
might
join
against
the
white
man
who
had
taken
their
land
i
am
an
indian
now
said
i
yes
and
you
will
forget
the
white
man
said
he
you
have
now
red
blood
in
your
veins
you
marry
indian
wife
you
all
the
same
as
one
indian
i
said
war
indian
beat
his
wife
suppose
she
talk
too
much
plenty
talk
plenty
beat
said
he
suppose
my
wife
talk
too
much
and
i
beat
her
what
indian
people
say
say
good
suppose
wife
too
old
you
take
two
wife
one
more
young
i
was
very
much
pleased
with
this
conversation
not
that
i
had
the
slightest
idea
of
profiting
by
his
information
by
taking
another
wife
but
i
felt
such
a
disgust
at
my
present
one
and
had
already
seen
what
a
fury
she
could
be
that
i
was
resolved
if
necessary
to
show
her
that
i
was
master
for
i
felt
certain
that
if
i
did
not
she
would
soon
attempt
to
master
me
and
so
it
turned
out
on
the
third
day
she
took
down
a
bow
and
arrows
and
made
a
sign
to
me
to
go
out
and
i
presumed
bring
back
food
and
as
there
was
nothing
in
the
house
i
thought
the
request
reasonable
i
therefore
went
out
of
the
wigwam
and
found
that
many
of
the
young
men
were
going
out
on
a
and
that
i
was
to
join
them
we
set
off
and
travelled
for
six
hours
before
we
came
to
the
and
as
the
deer
passed
me
i
thought
of
whyna
and
my
hunting
excursions
with
her
i
was
however
fortunate
and
killed
two
deer
much
to
the
surprise
of
the
indians
who
thought
a
white
man
could
not
use
a
bow
and
arrows
and
i
rose
very
much
in
their
estimation
in
consequence
the
deer
was
cut
up
and
we
hung
upon
branches
what
we
could
not
carry
we
did
not
go
home
that
night
but
feasted
over
a
large
fire
the
next
morning
we
all
carried
home
our
loads
and
mine
was
as
large
as
any
of
the
others
if
not
larger
neither
did
i
flag
on
the
way
for
i
was
naturally
very
strong
and
active
and
had
lately
been
inured
to
fatigue
when
we
arrived
the
squaws
and
men
among
the
others
were
despatched
for
the
remainder
of
the
venison
i
now
went
out
every
day
by
myself
and
practised
with
my
bow
till
i
had
become
more
expert
for
i
wanted
practice
i
had
no
musket
but
i
had
a
tomahawk
and
a
long
knife
i
began
to
pick
up
a
few
words
of
the
language
and
by
means
of
the
interpreter
i
gained
them
very
fast
before
i
had
been
three
months
with
the
indians
i
had
acquired
their
confidence
and
respect
they
found
that
i
was
expert
and
able
to
gain
my
own
livelihood
and
i
may
add
that
before
i
had
been
three
months
i
had
also
mastered
my
wife
when
she
found
that
i
would
not
submit
to
her
caresses
she
was
very
indignant
and
very
violent
but
i
immediately
knocked
her
down
and
beat
her
unmercifully
this
brought
her
to
her
senses
and
after
that
i
treated
her
as
my
slave
with
great
rigour
and
as
she
was
a
notorious
scold
the
indians
liked
me
all
the
better
for
it
you
may
think
that
this
was
not
fair
treatment
towards
a
woman
who
had
saved
my
life
but
she
only
saved
it
for
her
own
purposes
and
would
have
worn
my
ears
as
well
as
my
companion
if
i
had
not
killed
her
husband
the
fact
is
i
had
no
alternative
i
must
have
either
treated
her
kindly
and
submitted
to
her
nauseous
endearments
or
have
kept
her
at
a
respectful
distance
by
severity
and
i
hardly
need
say
that
i
preferred
the
latter
so
far
as
her
choice
of
a
husband
was
concerned
she
made
a
bad
one
for
she
received
nothing
but
blows
and
bad
usage
i
had
one
day
driven
my
wife
out
of
the
wigwam
in
consequence
of
her
presuming
to
talk
too
much
as
the
indian
said
when
the
interpreter
told
me
that
one
of
the
chiefs
was
willing
that
i
should
marry
his
daughter
polygamy
being
one
of
their
customs
i
was
very
much
annoyed
at
this
for
i
knew
the
young
girl
very
well
she
was
very
graceful
and
very
pretty
and
i
felt
that
my
fidelity
to
amy
would
be
in
great
danger
if
the
marriage
was
to
take
place
and
if
proposed
i
dared
not
refuse
so
great
a
distinction
i
replied
that
i
was
fortunate
but
that
i
feared
my
present
wife
would
make
her
very
unhappy
as
she
wanted
to
be
the
chief
woman
of
the
wigwam
and
when
i
was
away
i
could
not
tell
what
the
old
woman
might
do
to
her
and
the
conversation
was
dropped
this
little
indian
had
before
this
shown
me
as
much
favour
as
an
indian
girl
ever
ventures
to
show
sufficient
at
all
events
to
satisfy
me
that
i
was
not
disagreeable
to
her
and
what
the
interpreter
had
said
made
me
very
uncomfortable
however
i
consoled
myself
with
the
recollection
that
if
i
were
compelled
to
marry
this
girl
it
would
be
an
involuntary
infidelity
on
my
part
and
on
that
account
might
well
be
excused
for
the
hope
of
again
rejoining
amy
never
left
me
at
any
time
one
day
i
went
out
in
search
of
deer
and
was
led
away
from
my
companions
after
a
buck
which
i
had
wounded
and
attempted
to
overtake
they
saw
me
in
chase
of
my
quarry
and
left
me
in
pursuit
i
followed
for
several
hours
continually
coming
up
with
it
and
as
continually
losing
it
again
at
last
i
heard
the
report
of
a
musket
close
to
where
the
deer
was
last
seen
by
me
and
i
thought
that
some
indian
had
shot
it
i
walked
forward
however
very
cautiously
and
perceived
a
white
man
standing
by
the
animal
which
lay
at
his
feet
i
started
back
for
i
did
not
know
whether
i
had
fallen
in
with
a
friend
or
a
foe
but
as
i
knew
that
he
had
not
had
time
to
reload
his
musket
i
hallooed
to
him
concealing
myself
at
the
same
time
behind
a
tree
is
that
you
evans
said
the
man
in
reply
no
said
i
it
is
an
englishman
well
show
yourself
then
said
he
i
am
dressed
as
an
indian
replied
i
i
was
taken
by
the
indians
well
come
along
said
the
man
who
was
attired
as
a
seafaring
man
i
came
from
behind
the
tree
and
when
he
saw
me
he
snatched
up
his
musket
do
be
afraid
said
i
afraid
said
he
i
should
like
to
see
what
i
am
afraid
of
but
be
on
my
guard
that
right
i
replied
i
then
told
him
that
i
had
been
taken
by
the
indians
and
they
saved
my
life
because
one
of
their
women
chose
me
as
her
husband
and
that
i
was
anxious
to
escape
from
them
well
said
he
i
am
on
board
of
a
schooner
at
anchor
down
below
in
the
river
there
are
a
few
of
us
come
on
shore
to
get
some
venison
and
i
have
lost
my
comrades
but
i
had
no
idea
that
the
indians
were
down
here
so
close
to
the
english
settlements
how
close
are
we
then
said
i
for
i
know
not
where
i
am
this
is
certainly
not
our
usual
for
i
have
been
led
many
miles
from
it
in
pursuit
of
the
animal
you
have
just
shot
well
i
thought
so
for
i
have
been
on
shore
here
more
than
once
and
i
have
never
met
with
an
indian
you
ask
how
far
you
are
from
the
settlement
that
i
can
hardly
tell
you
because
the
settlers
have
spread
out
so
far
but
you
are
about
forty
or
fifty
miles
from
james
town
and
what
river
then
is
your
schooner
at
anchor
in
i
do
know
the
name
replied
the
man
i
not
sure
that
it
has
a
name
we
come
here
for
wood
and
water
because
it
is
quiet
not
inhabited
and
no
questions
asked
what
are
you
then
inquired
i
why
to
tell
you
the
truth
we
are
what
are
called
rovers
and
if
you
have
a
mind
to
come
on
board
we
can
find
a
berth
for
you
i
dare
say
many
thanks
replied
i
but
i
am
not
sufficiently
fond
of
the
sea
and
i
should
be
of
no
use
for
by
this
term
of
jolly
rover
i
knew
that
they
were
pirates
that
as
you
please
replied
he
no
harm
done
no
replied
i
and
i
thank
you
for
your
kind
offer
but
i
can
not
live
long
on
board
of
a
vessel
will
you
now
tell
me
which
is
the
right
track
to
the
english
plantations
why
said
he
they
bear
right
out
in
that
direction
and
i
dare
say
if
you
travel
five
or
six
leagues
you
will
fall
aboard
of
some
plantation
or
another
right
in
that
quarter
follow
your
nose
old
fellow
and
you
ca
go
wrong
many
thanks
i
replied
am
i
likely
to
meet
your
companions
they
may
take
me
for
an
indian
not
in
that
direction
replied
he
they
were
astern
of
me
a
long
way
farewell
then
and
many
thanks
i
replied
old
fellow
and
the
sooner
you
rub
off
that
paint
the
sooner
you
look
like
a
christian
said
the
careless
rover
as
i
walked
away
no
bad
advice
i
thought
for
i
was
now
determined
to
make
for
the
english
settlements
as
fast
as
i
could
and
i
will
do
so
when
i
once
see
an
english
habitation
but
not
before
i
may
fall
in
with
indians
yet
i
then
set
off
as
fast
as
i
could
and
being
now
inured
to
running
for
a
long
time
without
stopping
i
left
the
rover
a
long
way
behind
me
in
a
very
short
time
i
continued
my
speed
till
it
was
dark
when
i
heard
the
barking
of
a
dog
which
i
knew
was
english
for
the
indian
dogs
do
not
bark
i
then
proceeded
cautiously
and
in
the
direction
where
i
heard
the
dog
bark
and
arrived
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
a
cleared
ground
with
a
rail
fence
round
it
thank
god
i
cried
that
i
am
at
last
among
my
own
countrymen
i
considered
however
that
it
would
not
be
prudent
to
show
myself
especially
in
my
indian
paint
at
such
a
time
of
night
and
i
therefore
sat
down
under
the
of
a
large
tree
and
remained
there
till
morning
i
then
looked
about
for
water
and
having
found
a
running
stream
i
washed
off
my
paint
and
appeared
what
i
really
was
a
white
man
in
an
indian
dress
i
then
went
up
again
to
the
clearing
and
looked
for
the
habitation
which
i
discovered
on
the
top
of
a
hill
about
four
hundred
yards
off
the
trees
were
cleared
away
for
about
three
hundred
yards
all
round
it
it
was
built
of
heavy
logs
let
into
one
another
with
one
window
only
and
that
very
small
the
door
was
still
shut
i
walked
up
to
it
and
tapped
at
the
door
who
there
replied
a
hoarse
voice
an
englishman
and
a
stranger
i
replied
i
have
just
escaped
from
the
indians
we
see
what
you
are
in
a
very
short
time
replied
the
voice
james
get
me
my
gun
in
a
minute
the
door
opened
and
i
beheld
a
woman
more
than
six
feet
high
of
gaunt
appearance
and
large
dimensions
i
thought
that
i
had
never
seen
such
a
masculine
creature
before
it
was
her
voice
which
i
had
heard
two
men
were
seated
by
the
who
are
you
said
she
with
the
musket
ready
for
the
present
i
told
her
in
a
few
words
show
me
the
palm
of
your
hand
turn
it
up
at
once
i
did
so
without
the
least
idea
of
the
reason
for
the
demand
but
i
afterwards
discovered
that
it
was
to
ascertain
whether
i
was
one
of
those
who
had
been
transported
to
the
settlement
as
they
all
had
the
letter
r
branded
on
them
oh
you
not
a
then
i
see
you
may
come
in
but
give
me
that
bow
and
arrows
if
you
please
certainly
replied
i
if
you
wish
it
why
there
nothing
like
making
sure
in
this
world
and
although
you
look
a
very
peaceable
sort
of
personage
notwithstanding
your
indian
still
i
known
just
as
amiable
people
as
you
in
appearance
very
mischievous
at
times
now
come
in
and
let
us
hear
what
you
have
to
say
for
yourself
jeykell
get
some
more
wood
one
man
went
out
to
obey
her
orders
the
other
sat
by
the
fire
with
his
musket
between
his
knees
i
sat
down
by
the
fire
at
the
request
of
the
woman
who
had
seated
herself
by
the
side
of
the
man
and
then
on
her
repeating
her
question
i
gave
her
a
narrative
of
my
adventures
from
the
time
that
i
left
rio
well
says
she
we
seldom
hear
stories
like
them
it
all
the
world
like
a
book
and
pray
what
that
thing
pointing
to
the
diamond
in
its
case
you
have
hanging
to
your
neck
there
you
have
left
that
out
in
your
history
that
a
charm
given
me
by
my
indian
wife
to
preserve
me
from
disasters
from
wild
animals
no
panther
wolf
or
bear
will
ever
attack
me
well
said
she
if
so
be
it
has
that
power
all
i
can
say
is
not
a
bad
charm
to
wear
in
these
parts
for
there
are
animals
enough
in
the
woods
in
summer
and
round
the
house
all
night
in
winter
but
i
do
believe
a
bit
in
the
charm
and
that
the
truth
however
if
it
does
no
good
it
ca
do
no
harm
so
you
may
keep
it
on
and
welcome
may
i
ask
how
far
it
is
to
james
town
said
i
what
going
to
james
town
already
i
suppose
you
expect
to
be
there
not
exactly
my
good
woman
replied
i
i
must
trespass
upon
your
kindness
to
give
me
something
to
eat
for
i
am
hungry
good
woman
bah
and
pray
how
dare
you
call
me
good
woman
call
me
mistress
if
you
want
anything
i
beg
your
pardon
said
i
well
then
mistress
will
you
give
me
something
to
eat
yes
i
will
james
fetch
the
and
a
bit
of
salt
pork
and
give
him
to
eat
while
i
call
the
cows
from
the
bush
the
mistress
as
i
shall
in
future
call
her
then
put
down
her
musket
and
left
the
cabin
during
her
absence
i
entered
into
conversation
with
the
man
called
james
for
the
other
had
gone
out
to
my
inquiry
how
far
it
was
to
james
town
he
replied
that
he
really
did
not
know
that
he
was
sent
out
a
convict
and
sold
for
ten
years
to
the
husband
of
the
mistress
who
had
died
two
years
ago
that
this
man
had
a
small
vessel
in
which
he
went
to
james
town
by
water
and
that
he
had
returned
with
him
in
his
vessel
that
the
distance
by
water
he
considered
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
but
by
land
it
was
not
half
that
distance
that
he
did
not
know
the
way
nor
did
he
believe
that
there
was
any
road
as
yet
made
to
james
town
as
this
plantation
was
quite
by
itself
and
a
long
way
from
any
other
he
understood
that
the
nearest
plantation
was
twenty
miles
off
and
he
knew
there
was
no
road
to
it
as
no
one
ever
went
or
came
except
by
water
but
said
i
are
not
the
settlers
at
war
with
the
indian
tribes
that
surround
them
yes
and
have
been
now
for
three
or
four
years
and
the
indians
have
done
great
mischief
to
the
plantations
and
killed
a
great
many
people
but
the
settlers
have
punished
them
severely
then
how
is
it
that
this
plantation
which
is
so
solitary
has
not
been
attacked
because
the
mistress
husband
was
a
great
friend
of
the
indians
and
it
is
said
used
to
bring
them
cargoes
of
muskets
and
ammunition
from
james
town
contrary
to
all
law
and
regulation
but
if
he
was
friendly
with
them
the
mistress
is
not
for
she
has
quarrelled
with
the
principal
chief
and
i
should
not
be
surprised
if
we
were
attacked
some
day
and
all
scalped
and
what
does
the
mistress
say
to
that
oh
she
do
care
she
fight
a
hundred
indians
or
white
men
either
i
never
saw
such
a
creature
she
afraid
of
nothing
who
is
the
other
man
i
saw
here
oh
he
another
like
myself
there
were
three
of
us
but
one
was
drowned
by
falling
overboard
from
the
sloop
well
but
my
good
fellow
how
shall
i
get
to
james
town
i
sure
i
ca
tell
but
my
idea
is
that
you
will
never
get
there
unless
mistress
chooses
why
surely
she
wo
detain
me
by
force
wo
she
you
do
know
her
why
she
stop
an
army
replied
the
man
i
do
think
that
she
will
let
you
go
i
do
know
but
my
opinion
she
wants
another
hand
what
do
you
mean
to
say
that
she
make
me
work
i
mean
to
say
that
according
to
the
laws
of
the
settlement
she
has
a
right
to
detain
you
any
person
found
roving
here
who
can
not
give
a
satisfactory
account
of
himself
may
be
detained
till
something
is
heard
about
him
for
he
may
be
a
runaway
convict
or
a
runaway
apprentice
which
is
much
the
same
after
all
now
she
may
say
that
your
account
of
yourself
is
not
satisfactory
and
therefore
she
detained
you
and
if
you
wo
work
she
wo
give
you
to
eat
so
there
you
are
well
we
will
see
if
she
is
able
able
if
you
mean
strong
enough
why
she
take
you
up
with
one
hand
and
she
is
as
resolute
and
severe
as
she
is
strong
i
had
rather
have
to
deal
with
three
men
and
that
the
truth
what
the
truth
james
cried
the
mistress
coming
in
at
the
door
let
hear
the
truth
from
your
lips
it
will
be
something
new
i
said
that
i
was
sent
here
for
finding
a
mistress
all
yes
but
you
did
not
tell
him
where
you
found
it
at
the
bottom
of
a
gentleman
you
know
you
can
only
tell
the
truth
by
halves
yet
i
see
wishing
to
ascertain
how
far
the
man
suspicions
were
correct
i
said
to
her
i
have
good
friends
in
james
town
if
i
were
once
there
i
could
procure
money
and
anything
else
to
any
amount
that
i
required
well
says
she
you
may
have
but
i
afraid
that
the
post
do
go
out
one
would
think
after
all
your
wanderings
and
difficulties
that
you
be
glad
to
be
quiet
a
little
and
remain
here
so
we
talk
about
james
town
some
time
about
next
spring
indeed
mistress
i
hope
you
will
not
detain
me
here
i
can
pay
you
handsomely
on
my
arrival
at
james
town
for
your
kind
treatment
and
any
trouble
you
may
take
for
me
pay
me
what
do
i
want
with
money
there
no
shops
here
with
ribbons
and
calicoes
and
muslims
and
if
there
were
i
not
a
fine
madam
money
why
i
no
child
to
leave
what
i
have
to
no
husband
to
spend
it
for
me
i
have
bags
and
bags
of
dollars
young
man
which
my
husband
heaped
up
and
they
are
of
as
much
use
to
me
as
they
are
now
to
him
i
am
glad
that
you
are
so
rich
mistress
and
more
glad
that
your
money
is
so
little
cared
for
and
so
little
wanted
but
if
you
do
not
want
money
i
do
very
much
want
to
get
back
to
my
friends
who
think
i
am
dead
and
mourn
for
me
well
if
they
have
mourned
their
sorrow
is
over
by
this
time
and
therefore
your
staying
here
will
not
distress
them
more
i
may
as
well
tell
you
at
once
that
you
shall
not
go
so
make
up
your
mind
to
be
contented
and
you
fare
none
the
worse
for
it
this
was
said
in
so
decided
a
tone
that
bearing
in
mind
what
i
had
heard
from
the
convict
servant
i
thought
it
advisable
to
push
the
question
no
further
for
the
present
making
up
my
mind
that
i
would
wait
a
short
time
and
then
make
my
escape
if
she
still
persisted
in
detaining
me
by
force
but
this
i
could
not
venture
upon
until
i
was
in
possession
of
and
i
could
not
obtain
them
while
she
had
any
suspicion
i
therefore
replied
well
since
you
are
determined
i
shall
not
go
i
have
nothing
more
to
say
except
that
i
will
wait
your
pleasure
and
in
the
mean
time
let
me
make
myself
as
useful
as
i
can
for
i
do
want
to
eat
the
bread
of
idleness
you
a
very
sensible
young
man
replied
she
and
now
you
shall
have
a
shirt
to
put
on
which
will
improve
your
appearance
a
great
deal
she
then
went
into
the
inner
room
which
i
presumed
was
her
as
there
were
but
two
rooms
in
the
cabin
as
she
went
out
i
could
not
help
wondering
at
her
on
examination
i
felt
assured
that
she
was
more
than
six
feet
high
and
her
shoulders
as
broad
and
her
arms
as
nervous
as
a
man
of
that
stature
her
chest
was
very
expanded
but
bosom
she
had
none
in
fact
she
was
a
man
in
woman
clothing
and
i
began
to
doubt
her
sex
her
features
were
not
bad
had
they
been
of
smaller
dimensions
but
her
nose
was
too
large
although
it
was
straight
her
eyes
were
grand
but
they
were
surmounted
with
such
coarse
eyebrows
her
mouth
was
well
shaped
and
her
teeth
were
good
and
regular
but
it
was
the
mouth
of
an
ogress
her
walk
was
commanding
and
firm
every
action
denoted
energy
and
muscle
and
certainly
from
the
conversation
i
have
already
made
known
her
mind
was
quite
as
masculine
as
her
body
she
was
a
splendid
monster
in
a
minute
she
returned
bringing
me
a
good
check
shirt
and
a
pair
of
duck
trousers
which
i
thankfully
accepted
i
plenty
more
for
those
who
please
me
said
she
carelessly
when
you
put
them
on
come
out
to
me
and
i
show
you
the
plantation
in
a
minute
or
two
i
joined
her
and
she
led
me
round
the
then
to
the
maize
or
indian
corn
grounds
pointing
out
and
explaining
everything
she
also
showed
me
the
cows
store
pigs
and
poultry
wishing
to
please
her
i
asked
many
questions
and
pretended
to
take
an
interest
in
all
i
saw
this
pleased
her
much
and
once
or
twice
she
smiled
but
such
a
smile
after
an
hour
ramble
we
returned
and
found
the
two
servants
very
busy
one
husking
maize
and
the
other
in
the
shed
where
the
tobacco
was
dried
i
asked
some
questions
of
her
about
the
tobacco
how
many
casks
or
bales
she
made
a
year
she
replied
that
she
made
it
in
bales
and
sold
it
by
weight
it
must
be
heavy
carriage
from
here
to
james
town
said
i
yes
indeed
if
it
went
that
way
it
never
would
arrive
i
imagine
replied
she
but
i
have
a
sloop
in
the
river
below
which
carries
it
round
when
is
the
time
it
is
harvested
and
fit
to
be
carried
round
inquired
i
it
is
now
turning
fast
said
she
all
that
you
see
hanging
in
the
drying
sheds
has
been
already
drawn
in
three
or
four
weeks
it
will
be
housed
and
then
we
begin
to
pack
in
about
two
months
from
this
the
sloop
will
take
it
round
but
is
it
not
expensive
keeping
a
sloop
on
purpose
with
men
to
have
her
in
charge
inquired
i
to
hear
what
she
would
say
the
sloop
lies
at
anchor
without
a
soul
on
board
said
she
no
one
ever
comes
up
this
river
i
believe
captain
smith
who
made
the
settlement
did
so
once
there
is
another
river
about
twenty
miles
further
down
which
is
occasionally
frequented
by
buccaneers
i
am
told
indeed
i
know
it
for
my
husband
had
more
to
do
with
them
than
perhaps
was
good
for
his
soul
but
this
little
river
is
never
visited
then
your
servants
take
her
round
yes
i
leave
one
in
charge
and
take
two
with
me
but
you
have
but
two
not
till
you
came
one
died
but
now
i
have
three
and
she
smiled
at
me
again
if
i
had
not
been
so
afraid
of
affronting
her
i
certainly
would
have
said
to
her
do
anything
i
beg
but
smile
i
said
no
more
on
that
point
she
called
jeykell
who
was
in
the
and
desired
him
to
kill
a
couple
of
chickens
and
bring
them
in
we
then
entered
the
cabin
and
she
observed
i
do
doubt
but
you
are
tired
with
so
much
fatigue
you
look
so
go
and
sleep
on
one
of
their
beds
you
shall
have
one
for
yourself
by
night
i
was
not
sorry
to
do
as
she
proposed
for
i
was
tired
out
i
lay
down
and
i
did
not
wake
till
she
called
me
and
told
me
that
dinner
was
ready
i
was
quite
ready
for
that
also
and
i
sat
down
with
her
but
the
two
convict
servants
did
not
she
ate
in
proportion
to
her
size
and
that
is
saying
enough
after
dinner
she
left
me
and
went
with
her
two
men
on
her
farming
avocations
and
i
was
for
a
long
while
cogitating
on
what
had
passed
i
perceived
that
i
was
completely
in
her
power
and
that
it
was
only
by
obtaining
her
that
i
had
any
chance
of
getting
away
and
i
made
up
my
mind
to
act
accordingly
i
found
a
comfortable
bed
of
the
husks
of
indian
corn
prepared
for
me
at
night
in
an
where
the
two
slept
it
was
a
luxury
that
i
had
not
enjoyed
for
a
long
while
for
several
days
i
remained
very
quiet
and
apparently
very
contented
my
mistress
gave
me
no
hard
work
chiefly
sending
me
on
messages
or
taking
me
out
with
her
she
made
the
distinction
between
me
and
the
convicts
that
i
always
took
my
meals
with
her
and
they
did
not
in
short
i
was
treated
as
a
friend
and
visitor
more
than
anything
else
and
had
i
not
been
so
anxious
about
going
to
england
i
certainly
had
no
reason
to
complain
except
of
my
detention
and
this
it
was
evident
it
was
not
in
her
power
to
prevent
as
until
the
sloop
went
away
with
the
tobacco
she
had
no
means
of
sending
me
away
one
day
however
as
i
was
walking
past
the
i
heard
my
name
mentioned
by
the
two
convicts
and
stopping
i
heard
james
say
depend
upon
it
that
what
she
after
jeykell
and
he
is
to
be
our
master
whether
he
likes
it
or
not
well
i
should
wonder
replied
the
other
she
does
make
pure
love
to
him
that
certain
very
true
everything
fierce
with
her
even
love
and
so
he
find
it
if
he
do
fancy
her
yes
indeed
well
i
rather
serve
another
ten
years
than
she
should
fall
in
love
with
me
and
if
i
had
my
choice
whether
to
be
her
husband
or
to
swing
i
should
take
the
cord
in
preference
well
i
pity
him
from
my
heart
for
he
is
a
good
youth
and
a
and
a
handsome
too
and
i
sure
that
he
has
no
idea
of
his
unfortunate
situation
no
idea
indeed
said
i
to
myself
as
i
walked
away
merciful
heaven
is
it
possible
and
when
i
thought
over
her
conduct
and
what
had
passed
between
us
i
perceived
not
only
that
the
convicts
were
right
in
their
supposition
but
that
i
had
by
wishing
to
make
myself
agreeable
to
her
even
assisted
in
bringing
affairs
to
this
crisis
that
very
day
she
had
said
to
me
i
was
very
young
when
i
married
only
fourteen
and
i
lived
with
my
husband
nine
years
he
is
dead
more
than
a
year
now
when
she
said
that
which
she
did
at
dinner
while
she
was
clawing
the
flesh
off
a
wild
turkey
there
was
something
so
ridiculous
in
that
feminine
confession
coming
from
such
a
masculine
mouth
that
i
felt
very
much
inclined
to
laugh
but
i
replied
you
are
a
young
widow
and
ought
to
think
of
another
husband
again
when
she
said
if
ever
i
marry
again
it
shall
not
be
a
man
who
has
been
burnt
on
the
hand
no
no
my
husband
shall
be
able
to
open
both
hands
and
show
them
i
replied
you
are
right
there
i
would
never
disgrace
myself
by
marrying
a
convict
when
i
thought
of
these
and
many
other
conversations
which
had
passed
between
us
i
had
no
doubt
in
my
own
mind
but
that
the
convicts
were
correct
in
their
suppositions
and
i
was
disgusted
at
my
own
blindness
at
all
events
said
i
to
myself
after
a
long
cogitation
if
she
wants
to
marry
me
she
must
go
to
james
town
for
a
parson
and
if
i
once
get
there
i
will
contrive
as
soon
as
extra
constables
are
sworn
in
to
break
off
the
match
but
seriously
i
was
in
an
awkward
plight
there
was
something
in
that
woman
that
was
awful
and
i
could
imagine
her
revenge
to
be
most
deadly
i
thought
the
old
indian
squaw
to
be
bad
enough
but
this
new
mistress
was
a
thousand
times
worse
what
a
hard
fate
i
thought
was
mine
that
i
should
be
thus
forced
to
marry
against
my
will
and
be
separated
from
her
whom
i
adored
i
was
a
long
while
turning
over
the
matter
in
my
mind
and
at
last
i
resolved
that
i
would
make
no
alteration
in
my
behaviour
but
behave
to
her
as
before
and
that
if
the
affair
was
precipitated
by
my
mistress
that
i
would
be
off
to
the
woods
and
take
my
chance
of
wild
beasts
and
wild
indians
rather
than
consent
to
her
wishes
i
then
went
into
the
cabin
where
i
found
her
alone
alexander
said
she
she
would
know
my
christian
name
and
called
me
by
it
they
say
widows
court
the
men
and
that
they
are
privileged
to
do
so
i
turned
pale
for
i
little
thought
that
there
was
to
be
an
explanation
so
soon
at
all
events
whether
they
are
or
not
i
know
that
a
woman
in
my
position
can
not
well
expect
a
young
man
in
yours
to
venture
without
encouragement
now
alexander
i
have
long
perceived
your
feelings
and
your
wishes
and
i
have
only
to
say
that
mine
are
such
as
yours
oh
i
wish
they
were
thought
i
and
therefore
you
have
but
to
ask
and
to
have
i
was
mute
with
fear
and
despair
and
could
not
find
a
reply
to
make
to
her
why
do
you
not
answer
alexander
do
you
think
me
too
forward
no
stammered
i
you
are
very
kind
but
this
is
so
unexpected
so
unlooked
for
so
unhoped
for
i
am
so
overcome
observe
madam
how
strangely
the
sexes
were
changed
i
was
the
woman
in
this
instance
i
should
like
to
consult
my
friends
consult
your
fiddlesticks
replied
she
quickly
who
have
you
got
to
consult
i
hope
alexander
said
she
setting
her
broad
teeth
together
that
you
are
not
trifling
with
me
indeed
i
never
should
think
of
trifling
with
your
mistress
replied
i
i
feel
much
obliged
to
you
for
showing
such
a
preference
for
me
i
think
alexander
that
you
ought
so
now
then
if
you
please
give
me
your
answer
replied
she
had
i
been
prepared
for
your
kindness
i
would
have
done
so
at
once
but
i
have
many
serious
questions
to
put
to
myself
and
if
you
please
we
will
renew
the
subject
morning
i
will
then
tell
you
candidly
how
i
am
situated
and
if
after
that
you
do
not
withdraw
your
proposal
i
shall
be
most
happy
to
be
yours
as
soon
as
we
can
go
to
james
town
to
be
married
if
replied
she
you
mean
to
insinuate
alexander
that
you
have
a
wife
in
england
that
is
of
no
consequence
in
this
settlement
for
those
who
live
here
are
free
from
all
english
marriages
and
as
for
going
to
james
town
that
is
quite
unnecessary
if
the
people
in
the
settlement
were
to
wait
for
a
parson
when
they
married
they
would
never
be
married
at
all
all
that
is
necessary
is
that
we
shall
draw
up
an
agreement
of
marriage
on
paper
sign
it
and
have
it
witnessed
however
as
i
perceive
that
you
are
flurried
i
will
wait
till
morning
for
your
decision
my
mistress
then
rose
from
her
stool
and
went
into
her
chamber
shutting
to
the
door
with
more
emphasis
than
was
at
all
agreeable
to
my
nerves
i
walked
out
into
the
open
air
to
recover
myself
and
to
reflect
upon
what
course
i
should
take
in
this
awkward
and
dangerous
dilemma
marrying
was
out
of
the
question
but
how
to
avoid
it
it
was
almost
like
being
stopped
by
a
highwayman
he
says
your
money
or
your
life
my
mistress
demand
was
marriage
or
your
life
there
was
but
one
hope
which
was
to
escape
that
very
night
and
take
my
chance
in
the
woods
and
so
i
resolved
to
do
i
did
not
go
in
till
dark
my
mistress
was
in
her
own
room
the
two
convicts
were
sitting
by
the
fire
i
took
my
seat
by
them
but
did
not
speak
except
in
a
whisper
telling
them
that
their
mistress
was
not
well
and
that
we
had
better
go
to
bed
and
not
talk
they
stared
at
me
at
the
idea
of
the
mistress
being
ill
they
had
never
known
her
to
complain
of
anything
since
they
resided
with
her
but
the
hint
was
sufficient
they
went
to
bed
and
so
did
i
with
my
clothes
on
watching
the
crevices
of
the
door
of
her
room
to
see
if
her
lamp
was
out
in
about
half
an
hour
the
little
thin
beams
through
the
chinks
of
her
door
disappeared
and
then
i
knew
that
she
had
gone
to
bed
i
watched
two
hours
more
before
i
ventured
to
stir
the
convicts
were
both
snoring
loud
and
effectually
drowned
any
slight
noise
i
might
make
in
moving
about
i
went
to
the
locker
secured
all
the
cold
meat
for
provision
took
down
one
of
the
muskets
and
and
having
put
the
latter
over
my
shoulders
i
then
took
the
musket
in
my
hand
and
crept
softly
to
the
door
of
the
cabin
here
was
the
only
difficulty
once
out
but
five
yards
off
and
i
was
clear
i
removed
the
heavy
wooden
bar
without
noise
and
had
now
only
to
draw
the
bolt
i
put
my
finger
to
it
and
was
sliding
it
gently
and
successfully
back
when
my
throat
was
seized
and
i
was
hurled
back
on
the
floor
of
the
cabin
i
was
so
stunned
by
the
violence
of
the
fall
that
for
a
short
time
i
was
insensible
when
i
recovered
i
felt
a
great
weight
upon
my
chest
and
opening
my
eyes
found
my
mistress
sitting
upon
me
and
giving
orders
to
the
convicts
one
of
whom
had
already
lighted
the
lamp
for
mercy
sake
get
off
my
chest
said
i
in
a
faint
voice
yes
i
will
but
not
yet
replied
my
mistress
now
james
hand
them
to
me
james
handed
some
chains
to
his
mistress
who
turning
round
as
she
sat
on
my
body
made
the
manacle
at
the
end
of
the
chain
fast
round
my
ankle
this
went
with
a
which
could
not
be
opened
without
a
key
belonging
to
it
at
last
she
rose
off
my
body
and
i
could
breathe
free
she
then
called
to
the
convicts
saying
go
both
of
you
into
the
and
wait
there
till
i
call
you
out
if
i
find
you
one
foot
nearer
to
us
i
flay
you
alive
the
servants
ran
off
as
fast
as
they
could
when
they
were
gone
my
mistress
said
so
you
were
about
to
escape
were
you
you
would
avoid
the
chances
of
matrimony
and
now
you
have
other
chances
which
you
little
dreamt
of
i
thought
it
was
the
wisest
thing
that
i
could
do
replied
i
since
i
must
be
plain
i
am
sacredly
betrothed
to
another
person
and
i
could
not
even
for
you
break
my
faith
i
meant
to
have
told
you
so
morning
but
i
was
afraid
it
would
annoy
you
and
therefore
i
wished
to
go
away
without
giving
you
any
answer
well
sir
i
offered
to
be
your
wife
which
would
have
made
you
my
lord
and
master
you
refuse
it
and
now
i
make
you
my
slave
i
give
you
your
option
you
shall
either
consent
to
be
my
husband
or
you
shall
remain
as
you
are
and
toil
hard
but
any
time
that
you
think
better
of
it
and
are
willing
to
embrace
my
offer
you
will
be
free
and
i
will
be
as
a
wife
in
subjection
so
you
say
replied
i
but
suppose
i
was
to
make
you
angry
after
i
married
you
you
would
do
to
me
as
you
have
done
now
i
may
perhaps
one
day
get
free
from
this
chain
but
once
married
to
you
i
am
a
slave
for
ever
you
may
think
otherwise
before
long
replied
she
in
the
mean
time
you
may
walk
out
and
cool
yourself
she
then
returned
to
her
room
and
i
rose
having
determined
to
walk
out
and
cool
myself
as
she
proposed
but
when
i
was
on
my
legs
i
found
that
to
the
other
end
of
the
chain
which
was
very
heavy
and
about
two
yards
long
was
riveted
an
iron
ball
of
about
thirty
pounds
weight
so
that
i
could
not
walk
without
carrying
this
heavy
weight
in
my
hands
for
it
could
not
be
dragged
i
lifted
up
the
iron
ball
and
went
out
of
the
house
i
was
no
longer
afraid
of
her
i
was
in
too
great
a
rage
to
fear
anything
as
i
calmed
i
considered
my
case
and
found
it
to
be
hopeless
as
i
thought
of
amy
and
the
many
months
of
hope
deferred
i
wept
bitterly
and
i
had
no
consolation
for
the
reader
may
recollect
that
i
lost
my
bible
when
i
was
sent
on
shore
naked
almost
by
the
rascally
captain
of
the
transcendant
i
had
now
been
twenty
months
away
from
liverpool
and
i
felt
as
if
my
chance
of
seeing
her
that
i
loved
was
indeed
hopeless
i
might
remain
chained
in
such
a
solitude
for
years
or
i
might
expire
under
her
barbarous
treatment
for
i
fully
knew
what
i
had
to
expect
however
i
was
resolved
i
prayed
fervently
for
support
and
succour
in
my
time
of
trouble
and
became
more
composed
i
remained
out
the
whole
of
the
night
and
watched
the
rising
sun
the
two
convicts
came
out
to
their
work
and
shrugged
their
shoulders
as
they
passed
me
but
they
dared
not
speak
to
me
my
mistress
at
last
came
out
she
commenced
with
abuse
but
i
gave
no
answer
she
tried
soothing
but
i
was
mute
at
last
she
became
frantic
in
her
passion
hurled
me
away
from
her
and
after
being
dreadfully
beaten
i
fell
to
the
ground
she
put
her
foot
upon
my
neck
and
she
stood
there
looking
like
a
fury
she
loaded
me
with
epithets
and
then
of
a
sudden
went
down
on
her
knees
by
me
and
begged
my
pardon
calling
me
her
dear
alexander
her
life
entreating
me
to
accede
to
her
wishes
never
was
there
such
a
tigress
in
love
before
i
really
believe
hear
me
replied
i
as
long
as
i
am
chained
i
never
will
give
any
answer
upon
the
present
subject
that
i
swear
she
rose
from
my
side
and
walked
away
it
is
impossible
my
dear
madam
for
me
to
describe
what
i
suffered
from
this
woman
for
more
than
six
weeks
during
which
she
kept
me
chained
in
this
way
at
one
time
entreating
me
the
next
moment
kicking
me
and
throwing
me
down
i
had
no
peace
my
life
became
a
burden
to
me
and
i
often
entreated
her
in
mercy
to
put
an
end
to
my
sufferings
i
also
had
my
paroxysms
of
rage
and
then
would
spurn
her
spit
at
her
and
do
everything
i
could
and
say
all
that
i
could
imagine
to
show
my
hatred
and
contempt
at
other
times
i
was
sullen
and
that
always
annoyed
her
she
would
bear
my
reproaches
patiently
bear
any
thing
so
long
as
i
would
talk
but
if
i
remained
obstinately
silent
then
in
a
short
time
her
fury
would
break
forth
i
pitied
her
notwithstanding
her
for
the
woman
did
love
me
after
her
own
fashion
most
intensely
it
was
on
the
seventh
week
of
my
confinement
on
the
chain
that
one
morning
very
early
as
i
was
lying
in
the
for
she
had
turned
me
out
of
the
cabin
i
perceived
among
the
trees
which
were
about
three
hundred
yards
from
the
cabin
two
indians
in
what
is
called
their
which
is
a
sign
that
they
were
on
a
hostile
excursion
i
remained
perfectly
quiet
and
well
concealed
that
i
might
watch
them
the
convicts
had
more
than
once
told
me
that
the
indians
would
attack
us
in
consequence
of
an
insult
which
my
mistress
had
offered
to
their
chief
with
whom
her
husband
had
been
so
friendly
and
when
they
stated
what
had
passed
i
agreed
with
them
that
they
would
not
fail
to
resent
the
insult
as
soon
as
they
could
i
had
therefore
always
been
on
the
but
had
never
seen
any
indians
before
my
mistress
to
whom
i
had
in
our
days
of
sweet
converse
spoken
about
them
always
laughed
at
the
idea
of
their
attacking
her
and
said
that
they
might
come
if
they
liked
she
had
made
every
preparation
for
them
as
she
had
stuffed
up
with
moss
just
below
the
roof
of
the
cabin
from
which
you
could
fire
down
upon
them
till
they
were
within
four
yards
of
the
cabin
and
other
from
which
you
might
shoot
them
when
close
to
the
window
and
door
were
impregnable
and
provided
that
we
were
once
in
the
cabin
there
was
no
doubt
but
that
a
serious
if
not
effectual
resistance
might
be
made
that
the
indians
were
reconnoitring
the
cabin
was
evident
and
that
they
did
not
do
so
for
nothing
was
equally
certain
after
a
while
during
which
i
made
out
six
of
them
they
fell
back
in
the
wood
and
disappeared
the
dog
at
that
moment
came
out
to
me
and
it
was
probably
the
sight
of
the
dog
which
made
them
retreat
as
they
feared
that
he
would
have
given
notice
of
their
being
so
close
to
us
i
waited
till
the
convicts
came
out
and
then
i
went
into
the
cabin
and
said
you
drove
me
out
of
the
house
last
night
and
i
come
to
return
good
for
evil
as
i
lay
in
the
i
saw
six
indians
in
the
wood
to
the
east
of
the
cabin
reconnoitring
and
i
have
no
doubt
but
that
you
will
be
attacked
this
night
so
i
give
you
notice
and
you
hope
that
by
this
fear
of
their
attack
you
will
be
set
free
is
it
not
it
is
perfectly
indifferent
to
me
whether
i
am
or
not
i
have
often
asked
you
to
put
an
end
to
my
misery
and
as
you
have
not
done
it
i
shall
bless
those
indians
for
the
friendly
act
a
blow
of
a
tomahawk
will
release
me
if
you
will
not
well
then
let
them
come
with
their
tomahawks
replied
she
and
i
will
protect
you
from
them
for
no
one
shall
release
you
but
myself
as
you
please
replied
i
i
have
done
my
duty
in
telling
you
what
i
have
seen
and
you
may
take
precautions
or
not
for
myself
i
care
nothing
so
saying
i
lifted
up
my
ball
of
iron
and
went
away
out
of
the
door
i
remained
out
of
doors
the
whole
of
the
day
and
therefore
did
not
know
whether
my
mistress
took
any
precautions
or
not
but
i
told
the
two
convicts
what
i
had
seen
and
advised
them
not
to
go
far
from
the
cabin
as
they
would
run
great
danger
they
inquired
of
me
where
i
had
seen
the
indians
and
i
pointed
out
the
spot
in
the
wood
after
which
they
went
away
i
was
certain
that
the
attack
would
be
on
this
night
as
there
was
no
moon
till
three
hours
before
daybreak
and
as
it
was
very
dark
it
would
probably
take
place
in
the
early
part
of
the
night
i
had
made
up
my
mind
what
i
would
do
which
was
not
in
any
way
to
defend
the
cabin
while
chained
but
when
i
was
freed
i
would
fight
to
the
last
so
that
i
might
be
killed
where
i
stood
and
not
be
taken
alive
and
tortured
i
did
not
go
out
from
home
all
that
day
and
to
my
surprise
i
was
not
molested
by
my
mistress
at
dark
she
called
the
convicts
but
they
did
not
answer
she
came
out
to
look
for
them
and
asked
me
whether
i
had
seen
them
i
told
her
that
i
had
not
seen
them
for
two
hours
and
i
had
thought
that
they
were
in
the
house
did
you
tell
them
about
the
indians
yes
i
did
i
replied
and
stated
my
opinion
that
they
would
attack
us
this
night
and
i
advised
them
not
to
go
far
from
the
cabin
or
they
might
be
cut
off
then
the
cowardly
sneaks
have
run
off
to
the
woods
and
left
us
to
defend
ourselves
how
we
can
i
shall
not
defend
myself
replied
i
i
shall
stay
here
where
i
am
i
wait
for
death
and
will
not
avoid
it
come
into
the
house
said
she
abruptly
no
replied
i
i
will
not
you
will
not
said
she
and
catching
up
the
chain
and
ball
in
one
hand
with
her
other
arm
she
caught
me
round
the
waist
and
carried
me
into
the
house
well
replied
i
it
is
only
deferring
it
a
little
longer
they
will
force
their
way
in
it
at
last
and
i
will
die
here
wait
until
they
arrive
replied
my
mistress
but
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
will
not
defend
the
house
certainly
not
as
long
as
i
am
chained
as
a
slave
replied
i
my
mistress
made
no
reply
but
busied
herself
with
barring
the
door
and
window
she
then
placed
the
table
and
stools
so
that
she
might
stand
upon
them
and
fire
out
of
the
upper
pulled
the
moss
out
of
the
took
down
the
muskets
of
which
there
were
six
from
their
rests
examined
the
priming
of
those
which
were
loaded
and
loaded
those
which
were
not
she
then
got
out
a
supply
of
powder
and
ball
which
she
put
ready
on
the
table
brought
the
axes
out
that
they
might
be
at
hand
examined
the
to
ascertain
whether
the
convicts
had
filled
them
as
she
had
ordered
and
then
when
all
was
prepared
for
defence
she
removed
the
lamp
into
the
inner
room
leaving
the
one
we
were
in
so
dark
that
the
indians
could
not
by
looking
through
the
chinks
or
discover
where
the
occupants
of
the
cabin
might
be
all
these
arrangements
she
made
with
the
greatest
coolness
and
i
could
not
help
admiring
her
courage
and
is
there
any
more
to
be
done
alexander
said
she
in
a
mild
voice
where
is
the
dog
replied
i
tied
up
in
the
said
she
then
there
is
no
more
to
be
done
replied
i
the
dog
will
give
you
notice
of
their
coming
as
they
will
first
occupy
the
as
an
advanced
post
alexander
will
you
promise
not
to
escape
if
i
set
you
free
certainly
not
replied
i
you
set
me
free
for
your
own
purposes
because
you
wish
me
to
help
to
defend
your
property
and
then
forsooth
when
the
indians
are
beat
off
you
will
chain
me
again
no
no
that
was
not
my
feeling
as
i
sit
here
alive
replied
she
but
i
was
thinking
that
if
forced
to
retreat
from
the
cabin
you
would
never
be
able
to
escape
and
i
never
could
save
you
but
they
should
hack
me
to
pieces
first
answer
me
one
question
said
i
in
a
time
of
peril
like
this
would
you
as
a
conscientious
person
think
that
you
were
justified
in
retaining
in
such
fetters
even
a
convict
who
had
robbed
you
and
if
you
feel
that
you
would
not
on
what
grounds
do
you
act
in
this
way
to
a
man
whom
you
profess
to
love
i
leave
it
to
your
conscience
she
remained
silent
for
some
time
when
the
dog
barked
and
she
started
up
i
believe
i
am
mad
or
a
fool
said
she
sweeping
back
her
hair
from
her
forehead
she
then
took
the
key
of
the
manacle
out
of
her
dress
and
released
me
alexander
silence
said
i
putting
my
hand
to
her
mouth
this
is
no
time
to
be
heard
speaking
silence
repeated
i
in
a
whisper
i
hear
them
they
are
round
the
house
i
stood
upon
one
of
the
stools
and
looked
through
a
it
was
very
dark
but
as
the
indians
stood
on
the
hill
there
was
clear
sky
behind
them
as
low
down
as
their
waists
and
i
could
perceive
their
motions
as
they
appeared
to
be
receiving
orders
from
their
chief
and
they
advanced
to
the
door
of
the
cabin
with
axes
and
tomahawks
my
mistress
had
mounted
on
the
table
at
the
same
time
that
i
had
got
on
the
stool
we
now
got
down
again
without
speaking
and
each
taking
a
musket
we
kneeled
down
at
the
lower
which
i
have
described
on
second
thoughts
i
mounted
the
stool
whispering
to
her
do
fire
till
i
do
the
indians
came
to
the
door
and
tapped
one
asking
in
english
to
be
let
in
no
reply
was
given
and
they
commenced
their
attack
upon
the
door
with
their
axes
as
soon
as
this
aggression
took
place
i
took
good
aim
at
their
chief
as
i
presumed
him
to
be
who
was
now
standing
alone
on
the
hill
i
fired
he
fell
immediately
as
i
leaped
from
the
stool
my
mistress
discharged
her
musket
and
we
both
caught
up
others
and
returned
to
the
below
by
this
time
the
blows
of
the
axes
were
incessant
and
made
the
tremble
and
the
dust
to
fly
down
in
showers
from
the
roof
but
the
door
was
of
double
oak
with
iron
braces
and
not
easily
to
be
cut
through
and
the
bars
which
held
it
were
of
great
size
and
strength
it
was
some
time
before
we
could
get
another
shot
at
an
indian
but
at
last
i
succeeded
and
as
his
comrades
were
taking
the
body
away
my
mistress
shot
another
after
this
the
blows
of
the
axes
ceased
and
they
evidently
had
retreated
i
then
went
into
the
inner
room
and
extinguished
the
lamp
that
they
might
not
be
able
to
see
us
for
the
lamp
gave
a
faint
light
we
returned
to
the
table
and
loaded
the
muskets
in
the
dark
as
i
put
my
musket
on
the
table
my
mistress
said
will
they
come
again
yes
replied
i
i
think
they
will
but
if
you
wish
to
talk
we
had
better
retreat
to
the
there
we
shall
be
safe
from
any
shot
we
retreated
to
the
and
sat
down
on
the
ashes
it
just
held
us
both
and
my
mistress
took
this
opportunity
of
embracing
me
saying
dear
alexander
if
i
had
a
thousand
lives
i
would
sacrifice
them
for
you
we
have
but
one
replied
i
and
that
one
i
will
devote
for
your
defence
i
can
do
no
more
who
did
you
fire
at
said
she
the
chief
as
i
believe
who
was
on
the
hill
giving
orders
he
fell
and
i
think
that
he
fell
dead
then
depend
upon
it
they
will
retreat
said
she
i
think
not
they
will
be
revenged
if
they
possibly
can
and
we
must
expect
a
hard
fight
for
it
why
what
can
they
do
they
never
can
break
through
the
door
and
when
daylight
comes
we
can
shoot
them
by
dozens
depend
upon
it
said
i
they
will
try
to
burn
us
out
the
wind
is
high
which
is
all
in
their
favour
and
i
suspect
they
are
now
gone
to
collect
and
if
they
do
fire
the
cabin
what
shall
we
do
i
never
thought
of
that
we
must
remain
in
it
as
long
as
we
can
and
then
sally
out
and
fight
to
the
last
but
everything
depends
on
circumstances
be
guided
by
me
and
i
will
save
you
if
i
can
be
guided
by
you
yes
recollect
i
am
not
in
chains
now
and
that
although
you
have
the
courage
of
a
man
still
you
have
not
been
so
accustomed
to
warfare
as
i
have
been
i
have
long
been
accustomed
to
command
to
plan
and
to
execute
in
times
of
peril
like
this
you
have
great
strength
and
courage
i
little
thought
what
a
lion
i
had
chained
up
replied
she
well
i
love
you
all
the
better
for
it
and
i
will
be
guided
by
you
for
i
perceive
already
that
you
have
the
best
head
of
the
two
hark
what
is
that
it
is
what
i
said
replied
i
they
are
laying
against
the
logs
of
the
cabin
on
the
windward
side
this
was
on
the
side
opposite
to
the
door
now
we
must
try
if
we
can
not
pick
off
some
more
of
them
said
i
rising
and
taking
a
musket
bring
the
stools
over
to
this
side
for
we
must
fire
from
the
upper
we
remained
at
our
posts
for
some
time
without
seeing
an
indian
they
had
gone
back
to
the
wood
for
more
combustibles
at
last
we
perceived
them
coming
back
with
the
wood
i
should
imagine
there
were
at
least
twenty
of
them
now
take
good
aim
said
i
we
both
fired
almost
at
the
same
moment
and
three
indians
fell
get
down
and
give
me
another
musket
said
i
to
my
mistress
she
handed
me
one
and
taking
another
for
herself
resumed
her
station
we
fired
several
times
sometimes
with
and
sometimes
without
success
for
the
indians
went
away
twice
for
before
they
had
collected
what
they
considered
sufficient
by
this
time
it
was
piled
up
to
the
eaves
of
the
cabin
and
our
were
shut
up
we
therefore
went
over
to
the
other
side
where
the
door
was
to
see
if
there
were
any
indians
there
but
could
not
see
one
we
had
been
on
the
for
about
five
minutes
when
the
crackling
of
the
wood
and
the
smoke
forcing
itself
though
the
crevices
between
the
logs
told
us
that
the
fire
had
been
applied
and
the
wind
soon
fanned
it
up
so
that
the
flame
poured
through
every
chink
and
and
lighted
up
the
cabin
we
must
retreat
to
the
said
i
come
quickly
or
we
shall
be
shot
why
so
said
she
as
she
did
as
i
requested
they
will
peep
through
the
on
the
side
of
the
cabin
where
the
door
is
and
see
us
plainly
until
the
cabin
is
filled
with
smoke
which
it
soon
will
be
but
tell
me
what
we
are
to
do
now
for
i
feel
if
this
smoke
increases
we
shall
not
be
able
to
speak
to
one
another
this
she
said
about
five
minutes
after
we
had
remained
standing
in
the
with
our
heads
up
the
chimney
perhaps
it
will
be
as
well
replied
i
that
i
do
speak
so
this
fierce
wind
drives
the
smoke
to
leeward
in
volumes
but
the
great
burst
of
smoke
will
be
when
the
roof
is
well
on
fire
it
is
now
burning
fiercely
on
the
windward
side
but
we
must
wait
till
the
has
caught
and
then
the
volume
of
smoke
will
be
greater
the
great
point
is
to
hit
the
precise
time
of
opening
the
door
and
escaping
shrouded
in
a
volume
of
smoke
if
too
soon
they
will
perceive
us
and
we
shall
be
shot
down
if
too
late
the
roof
will
fall
upon
us
and
we
shall
be
smothered
or
burnt
we
had
better
now
i
think
leave
this
and
be
all
ready
our
best
weapon
if
we
had
to
fight
our
way
will
be
an
axe
let
us
each
take
one
and
by
now
going
near
to
the
door
and
putting
our
mouths
to
one
of
the
we
shall
breathe
freer
and
unbar
the
door
at
the
right
time
do
you
agree
with
me
you
are
right
said
she
you
are
a
and
i
am
a
we
left
the
and
having
felt
for
and
found
the
axes
we
went
near
the
door
and
put
our
mouths
to
the
below
and
the
smoke
passing
above
them
enabled
us
to
breathe
freer
i
looked
out
and
perceived
that
with
the
exception
of
about
six
yards
to
leeward
of
the
cabin
there
was
a
dense
volume
of
smoke
rolling
along
the
ground
for
a
long
distance
and
that
if
we
could
only
once
gain
it
without
being
perceived
we
should
probably
be
saved
i
therefore
unbarred
the
door
drew
the
bolt
and
held
it
in
my
hand
all
ready
for
a
start
the
cabin
was
now
in
flames
in
every
part
as
well
as
the
roof
i
touched
my
mistress
and
then
took
her
hand
in
mine
watching
at
the
at
last
when
the
heat
was
almost
unbearable
an
eddy
of
the
wind
drove
back
the
smoke
close
to
the
of
the
cabin
and
all
was
dark
i
jumped
up
opened
the
door
and
dragged
my
mistress
after
me
we
walked
out
into
the
black
mass
completely
hid
from
our
enemies
and
then
running
as
fast
as
we
could
to
leeward
in
the
centre
of
the
smoke
we
found
ourselves
at
least
one
hundred
yards
from
the
cabin
without
the
indians
having
any
idea
that
we
were
not
still
inside
as
we
retreated
the
density
of
the
smoke
became
less
and
i
then
told
her
to
run
for
her
life
as
the
indians
would
discover
that
the
door
of
the
cabin
was
open
and
that
we
had
escaped
and
so
it
proved
we
were
still
a
hundred
yards
from
the
wood
when
a
yell
was
given
which
proved
that
they
had
discovered
our
escape
and
were
in
pursuit
we
gained
the
wood
i
turned
round
a
moment
to
look
behind
me
and
perceived
at
least
forty
or
fifty
indians
in
full
pursuit
of
us
the
foremost
about
two
hundred
yards
distant
now
we
must
run
for
it
mistress
said
i
and
we
must
no
longer
take
hands
we
shall
have
to
thread
the
wood
away
we
have
no
time
to
lose
so
saying
i
snatched
my
hand
from
her
and
sprang
forward
she
following
me
as
fast
as
she
could
more
fearful
evidently
of
my
making
my
escape
from
her
than
of
her
own
escape
from
the
indians
as
soon
as
i
was
a
hundred
yards
in
the
wood
i
turned
short
to
the
right
and
fled
with
all
my
speed
in
that
direction
because
i
hoped
by
this
means
to
deceive
the
indians
and
it
was
easier
to
run
where
the
wood
was
not
so
thick
my
mistress
followed
me
close
she
would
have
hallooed
to
me
but
she
had
not
breath
after
the
first
i
found
out
that
i
was
more
fleet
than
she
was
whether
encumbered
with
her
clothes
or
perhaps
not
so
much
used
to
exercise
i
heard
her
panting
after
me
i
could
easily
have
left
her
but
my
fear
was
that
she
would
have
called
to
me
and
if
she
had
the
indians
would
have
heard
her
and
have
known
the
direction
i
had
taken
and
when
once
on
my
trail
they
would
as
soon
as
daylight
came
have
followed
me
by
it
to
any
distance
i
therefore
slackened
my
speed
so
as
just
to
enable
my
mistress
to
keep
up
with
me
at
about
ten
yards
distance
when
we
had
run
about
three
miles
i
felt
certain
that
she
could
not
proceed
much
further
speak
she
could
not
and
as
i
ran
without
once
looking
behind
me
she
could
make
no
sign
i
continued
at
a
less
rapid
pace
for
about
a
mile
further
i
did
this
to
enable
her
to
keep
up
with
me
and
to
recover
my
own
breath
as
much
as
possible
previous
to
a
start
the
voices
of
the
indians
had
long
been
out
of
hearing
and
it
was
clear
that
they
had
not
discovered
the
direction
which
we
had
taken
i
knew
therefore
that
they
could
not
hear
her
now
if
she
did
cry
out
as
loud
as
she
could
and
i
gradually
increased
my
speed
till
i
could
no
longer
hear
her
panting
behind
me
i
then
went
off
at
my
full
speed
and
after
a
few
minutes
i
heard
her
voice
at
some
distance
faintly
calling
out
my
name
yes
thought
i
but
i
have
not
forgotten
the
ball
and
chain
and
if
you
thought
that
you
had
let
loose
a
lion
while
we
were
in
the
cabin
you
shall
find
that
you
have
loosed
a
deer
in
the
woods
i
then
stopped
for
a
few
moments
to
recover
my
breath
i
did
not
however
wait
long
i
was
afraid
that
my
mistress
might
recover
her
breath
as
well
as
myself
and
i
again
set
off
as
fast
as
i
could
the
idea
of
torture
from
the
indians
or
again
being
kept
confined
by
my
mistress
gave
me
endurance
which
i
thought
myself
incapable
of
before
morning
i
calculated
that
i
had
run
at
least
twenty
miles
if
not
more
with
the
perspiration
running
down
me
in
streams
and
hardly
able
to
drag
one
leg
before
the
other
i
at
last
just
about
daybreak
gave
it
up
when
i
threw
myself
on
the
ground
and
dropped
out
of
my
hand
my
axe
which
i
had
carried
the
whole
way
i
lay
there
for
more
than
half
an
hour
tormented
with
thirst
but
quite
unable
to
move
at
last
i
recovered
and
as
i
well
knew
that
the
indians
would
divide
in
parties
of
three
or
four
and
hunt
every
part
of
the
woods
and
by
daylight
probably
discover
my
track
i
rose
and
prepared
to
resume
my
toil
when
looking
round
me
i
perceived
that
i
was
exactly
on
the
spot
where
i
had
followed
the
deer
and
had
fallen
in
with
the
jolly
rover
as
he
termed
himself
who
had
pointed
out
the
way
to
the
plantations
i
turned
and
saw
the
river
below
and
as
he
had
told
me
that
the
indians
never
came
there
i
resolved
to
go
to
the
river
where
at
least
i
should
find
and
water
i
did
so
and
in
half
an
hour
arrived
at
the
skirts
of
the
wood
and
found
that
the
river
was
about
four
hundred
yards
from
me
and
clear
of
trees
at
the
mouth
for
some
distance
i
went
down
to
the
river
which
ran
swiftly
cut
and
i
drank
till
i
was
ready
to
burst
i
then
rose
on
my
feet
and
walked
along
its
banks
towards
the
mouth
thinking
what
i
should
do
to
get
to
james
town
appeared
to
me
to
be
an
impossibility
unless
by
water
and
i
was
not
likely
to
meet
with
any
other
vessel
here
but
a
pirate
should
i
then
go
aboard
of
a
pirate
it
appeared
to
me
to
be
my
only
resource
and
that
i
should
be
happy
if
i
could
find
one
by
this
time
i
had
arrived
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
and
looking
out
to
seaward
i
saw
a
schooner
at
anchor
she
was
about
three
miles
off
that
she
was
a
pirate
vessel
i
presumed
should
i
go
on
board
of
her
or
not
and
if
so
how
was
i
to
get
on
board
all
her
boats
were
up
and
i
surmised
that
she
had
just
left
the
river
with
the
intention
of
sailing
as
soon
as
there
was
any
wind
for
now
it
was
calm
the
river
ran
out
swiftly
and
i
thought
i
should
be
able
to
swim
the
distance
with
the
assistance
i
should
obtain
from
the
current
which
swept
down
right
for
her
and
she
was
riding
to
its
strength
i
was
demurring
i
had
been
perhaps
two
hours
on
the
beach
waiting
to
see
if
she
might
send
a
boat
on
shore
when
as
i
stood
at
the
still
hesitating
i
happened
to
turn
round
and
perceived
three
indians
coming
down
upon
me
as
fast
as
they
could
i
hesitated
no
longer
but
plunged
into
the
stream
and
was
swept
out
two
hundred
yards
before
they
arrived
at
the
beach
i
made
for
the
schooner
and
the
current
ran
out
so
fast
that
in
half
an
hour
i
was
close
to
her
i
swam
for
her
cable
which
i
clung
to
and
then
shouted
loudly
this
induced
some
of
the
crew
to
look
over
the
bows
and
they
handed
me
a
bowling
knot
into
which
i
fixed
myself
and
was
hauled
on
board
i
was
dragged
aft
to
give
an
account
of
myself
and
i
stated
in
few
words
that
i
had
been
pursued
by
the
indians
and
swam
off
to
save
my
life
we
met
before
said
a
rough
voice
i
looked
and
saw
the
jolly
rover
whom
i
had
fallen
in
with
on
shore
i
said
yes
i
was
escaping
from
the
indians
when
i
met
you
and
you
showed
me
the
direction
of
the
plantations
all
right
said
he
it
a
true
bill
and
were
those
indians
after
you
that
we
saw
on
the
beach
just
now
yes
i
replied
and
then
i
stated
how
it
was
that
they
had
attacked
our
cabin
and
how
we
had
escaped
that
was
well
done
and
so
you
swam
off
three
miles
fire
and
water
wo
hurt
you
that
clear
you
just
the
man
for
us
what
is
this
that
you
have
hung
round
your
neck
said
he
taking
up
the
leathern
bag
with
the
diamond
in
it
that
replied
i
a
sudden
thought
having
struck
me
is
my
caul
i
was
born
with
a
caul
and
i
have
always
worn
it
as
it
saves
a
man
from
drowning
no
wonder
that
you
swam
three
miles
then
replied
the
man
you
must
know
madam
that
some
people
are
born
with
a
membrane
over
the
face
which
is
termed
a
caul
and
there
has
been
a
vulgar
error
that
such
people
can
never
be
drowned
especially
if
they
wear
this
caul
about
their
person
in
sailors
are
superstitious
in
many
things
but
particularly
in
this
and
my
caul
was
therefore
as
by
them
as
it
hung
round
my
neck
as
it
was
by
the
indians
when
they
thought
it
was
what
they
call
magic
or
medicine
well
said
the
jolly
rover
as
you
had
so
much
fire
so
much
water
and
so
much
running
i
think
you
wo
be
sorry
to
have
a
biscuit
and
glass
of
grog
and
then
turn
in
we
will
talk
to
you
i
went
down
below
very
glad
to
accept
the
offer
and
as
i
was
regaling
myself
who
should
come
up
to
me
but
two
of
the
portuguese
who
had
been
wrecked
in
the
xebeque
and
put
on
shore
with
me
in
the
little
boat
by
the
captain
of
the
transcendant
i
was
very
glad
to
see
them
they
told
me
that
after
great
hardship
and
suffering
they
had
arrived
famished
at
the
banks
of
this
river
and
had
been
taken
on
board
by
the
pirates
and
had
remained
with
them
ever
since
that
they
were
very
anxious
to
get
away
but
never
had
an
opportunity
i
begged
them
not
to
say
who
i
was
but
merely
that
i
was
once
a
shipmate
of
theirs
they
promised
and
being
very
tired
i
then
lay
down
and
fell
asleep
i
was
so
worn
out
that
i
did
not
wake
till
the
next
morning
when
i
found
that
we
were
under
all
sail
running
down
to
the
southward
i
saw
the
jolly
rover
as
i
had
termed
him
on
deck
his
real
or
assumed
name
i
do
know
which
i
found
out
to
be
toplift
sitting
on
a
gun
abaft
he
called
me
to
him
i
said
are
you
the
captain
yes
he
replied
for
want
of
a
better
i
told
you
months
ago
what
we
were
so
it
no
use
repeating
it
do
you
intend
to
join
us
then
replied
i
i
will
be
very
candid
with
you
i
have
been
driven
as
it
were
on
board
of
your
vessel
but
certainly
without
knowing
exactly
what
she
was
now
captain
i
have
to
ask
you
one
question
would
you
if
you
could
go
on
shore
in
england
with
plenty
of
money
at
your
command
and
plenty
of
good
friends
would
you
be
here
no
certainly
not
replied
he
well
i
am
in
that
position
if
once
in
england
i
have
money
enough
to
live
upon
and
plenty
of
friends
i
therefore
naturally
want
to
get
back
to
england
and
not
to
run
the
risk
of
my
neck
on
board
of
this
vessel
that
very
true
replied
he
but
there
are
other
considerations
my
men
wo
have
a
man
on
board
who
will
not
swear
fidelity
and
if
you
will
not
i
can
not
protect
you
they
will
throw
you
overboard
we
do
carry
passengers
that
very
true
also
and
i
will
swear
fidelity
so
far
as
this
that
you
never
shall
be
betrayed
by
me
and
i
never
will
appear
as
a
witness
against
one
of
you
it
were
most
ungrateful
if
i
did
while
i
am
on
board
i
will
do
any
duty
you
please
to
put
me
to
for
i
can
not
expect
to
eat
my
bread
for
nothing
and
suppose
we
come
to
action
there
the
difficulty
replied
i
against
an
english
ship
i
never
will
fight
but
if
we
are
opposed
to
any
other
nation
and
there
is
a
chance
of
our
being
overpowered
why
then
if
you
are
overpowered
as
i
shall
be
flung
along
with
the
rest
i
think
i
must
do
all
i
can
to
save
my
own
life
but
overpowered
or
not
i
will
not
fire
a
shot
or
draw
a
cutlass
against
my
own
countrymen
well
i
can
not
deny
but
that
all
very
fair
i
think
replied
i
it
is
as
much
as
you
can
expect
especially
as
i
never
will
share
any
well
i
will
talk
to
the
men
and
hear
what
they
say
but
now
answer
me
one
question
are
you
not
a
seaman
i
will
answer
the
truth
to
everything
i
am
a
seaman
and
i
have
commanded
a
privateer
i
have
served
many
years
in
privateers
and
have
seen
a
great
deal
of
hard
fighting
so
i
thought
replied
he
and
now
answer
me
another
question
was
it
not
you
that
played
that
trick
to
that
french
privateer
captain
at
bordeaux
yes
it
was
replied
i
but
how
came
you
to
know
that
because
i
was
the
mate
of
a
merchant
vessel
that
had
been
captured
and
i
saw
you
three
or
four
times
as
you
passed
the
vessel
i
was
on
board
of
for
being
put
in
quarantine
we
were
not
sent
to
prison
till
the
pratique
was
given
i
thought
that
i
knew
you
again
i
have
no
concealment
to
make
no
but
i
will
tell
you
candidly
my
men
if
they
knew
all
this
would
not
allow
you
to
leave
the
vessel
indeed
you
might
be
captain
if
you
pleased
for
i
do
not
suit
them
our
captain
for
i
was
his
officer
was
killed
about
six
months
ago
and
i
really
am
not
fit
for
the
office
i
am
too
well
you
do
look
so
replied
i
laughing
ca
judge
of
outsides
replied
he
but
it
a
fact
they
say
that
they
will
be
all
condemned
if
taken
from
my
not
destroying
the
crews
of
the
vessels
we
take
that
they
will
be
so
many
witnesses
against
them
and
i
can
not
make
up
my
mind
to
murder
i
am
bad
enough
i
rob
on
the
high
seas
i
kill
on
the
high
seas
for
we
must
kill
when
we
fight
but
i
can
not
commit
deliberate
murder
either
at
sea
or
on
shore
and
so
i
tell
them
if
any
one
else
could
navigate
the
vessel
i
should
be
superseded
immediately
i
am
glad
to
hear
you
say
what
you
have
captain
it
makes
me
less
dissatisfied
at
finding
myself
here
well
i
have
said
all
i
can
and
i
must
trust
to
you
to
manage
with
your
ship
company
it
will
be
a
difficult
job
said
he
musing
tell
them
replied
i
that
i
was
once
a
captain
of
a
vessel
like
this
after
all
there
is
not
so
much
difference
between
a
pirate
and
a
privateer
as
you
may
think
and
that
i
will
not
be
under
the
command
of
any
one
if
they
hear
that
they
will
give
you
the
command
of
this
vessel
i
will
refuse
to
take
it
and
give
my
reasons
well
i
tell
them
that
i
leave
you
to
settle
with
them
how
you
can
but
added
he
in
a
low
tone
there
are
some
desperate
villains
among
them
that
i
take
for
granted
replied
i
so
now
i
leave
you
to
speak
to
them
toplift
did
so
he
told
them
that
i
was
a
pirate
captain
who
had
lost
his
vessel
and
been
thrown
on
shore
but
i
refused
to
join
any
ship
except
as
captain
of
her
that
i
would
not
serve
as
first
officer
and
would
obey
no
one
he
told
them
that
he
knew
me
before
and
he
narrated
the
business
at
bordeaux
when
i
commanded
a
privateer
extolling
me
as
i
afterwards
found
beyond
all
measure
the
crew
having
heard
what
he
had
to
say
went
forward
and
after
consultation
came
to
toplift
and
said
that
i
must
take
the
oath
toplift
replied
that
he
had
desired
me
so
to
do
and
that
i
had
answered
that
i
would
not
but
said
he
you
had
better
speak
to
him
yourselves
call
all
hands
aft
and
hear
what
he
has
to
say
this
was
done
and
i
was
sent
for
i
have
told
them
what
you
said
sir
i
do
know
your
name
i
have
no
name
replied
i
proudly
except
that
my
name
the
fact
is
madam
i
was
determined
to
carry
it
out
bravely
knowing
that
it
is
the
best
way
to
deal
with
such
people
as
i
now
had
in
hand
well
then
captain
i
have
told
the
men
that
you
will
not
take
the
oath
take
the
oath
replied
i
with
scorn
no
i
administer
the
oath
to
others
i
make
them
take
it
i
make
them
swear
fidelity
to
me
such
has
been
my
conduct
and
i
shall
not
depart
from
it
well
but
captain
toplift
you
do
mean
to
say
that
he
is
to
remain
on
board
with
us
and
not
take
the
oath
said
a
ruffian
in
spite
of
you
he
shall
take
the
oath
captain
toplift
captain
toplift
said
i
calmly
do
you
allow
one
of
your
crew
to
use
such
language
as
this
had
i
been
captain
of
this
ship
i
would
have
blown
his
brains
out
as
he
stood
you
do
know
how
to
deal
with
these
rascals
i
do
captain
toplift
who
appeared
much
pleased
at
being
supported
in
this
way
by
me
strange
that
a
single
individual
whom
they
might
have
thrown
overboard
in
a
minute
should
have
gained
such
an
ascendency
but
so
it
was
and
who
perceived
that
the
men
fell
back
as
if
taken
by
surprise
then
said
captain
you
have
taught
me
a
good
lesson
which
i
will
take
advantage
of
seize
that
fellow
and
put
him
in
irons
hah
cried
the
man
seeing
that
no
man
touched
him
who
is
to
bell
the
cat
hah
and
drew
his
cutlass
i
will
then
said
i
to
captain
toplift
if
you
desire
it
and
stepping
forward
i
went
up
to
the
man
saying
come
come
my
good
fellow
this
wo
do
here
i
am
used
to
deal
with
such
chaps
as
you
and
i
can
manage
worse
than
you
a
good
deal
i
advanced
till
i
was
within
the
stroke
of
his
cutlass
before
he
was
aware
of
it
and
seizing
him
by
the
waist
i
threw
him
flat
on
his
back
and
put
my
foot
on
his
neck
now
cried
i
in
an
authoritative
voice
put
this
man
in
irons
immediately
refuse
who
dares
here
you
sirs
lay
hold
of
this
fellow
continued
i
looking
to
the
portuguese
who
accordingly
came
forward
and
led
him
away
assisted
by
others
who
now
joined
them
are
there
any
more
mutineers
here
inquired
i
if
so
let
them
step
forward
no
one
stirred
my
lads
said
i
it
is
very
true
that
i
have
refused
to
take
the
oath
for
the
oath
is
not
given
to
those
who
command
but
to
those
who
obey
but
at
the
same
time
i
am
not
one
to
betray
you
you
know
who
i
am
and
is
it
likely
no
no
replied
the
men
sir
asked
one
of
them
who
had
been
most
forward
and
insolent
will
you
be
our
captain
say
but
the
word
you
are
the
sort
of
man
we
want
you
have
a
captain
already
replied
i
and
in
a
few
weeks
i
shall
command
a
vessel
of
my
own
i
can
not
therefore
accept
your
offer
but
while
i
am
on
board
i
will
do
all
in
my
power
to
assist
captain
toplift
in
any
way
and
you
can
desire
no
more
and
now
my
men
as
an
old
hand
i
have
but
this
advice
to
give
you
which
is
to
return
to
your
duty
for
everything
in
a
vessel
of
this
description
depends
upon
obedience
and
to
you
captain
toplift
i
have
also
advice
to
give
which
is
to
shoot
the
first
man
who
behaves
as
that
scoundrel
did
who
is
now
in
irons
boatswain
pipe
down
i
hardly
knew
whether
this
latter
order
would
be
obeyed
by
the
boatswain
or
if
obeyed
by
the
boatswain
whether
it
would
be
obeyed
by
the
men
but
to
my
great
satisfaction
it
was
and
the
men
retired
peaceably
well
captain
toplift
said
i
i
have
done
you
no
harm
and
myself
some
good
you
have
indeed
replied
he
come
down
into
the
cabin
when
we
were
in
the
cabin
he
said
you
have
unarmed
and
subdued
the
most
mutinous
rascal
in
the
vessel
and
you
have
strengthened
my
authority
they
fully
believe
you
are
what
you
assert
from
your
behaviour
and
i
feel
with
you
at
my
side
i
shall
get
on
better
with
these
fellows
than
i
have
done
but
now
to
keep
up
the
idea
you
must
of
course
mess
in
the
cabin
with
me
and
i
can
offer
you
clothes
not
my
own
but
those
of
the
former
captain
which
will
suit
your
shape
and
make
i
readily
agreed
with
him
and
having
equipped
myself
in
the
clothes
he
offered
me
which
were
handsome
i
soon
afterwards
went
on
deck
with
him
and
received
the
greatest
respect
from
the
men
as
i
passed
them
a
cot
was
slung
for
me
in
the
cabin
and
i
lived
altogether
with
captain
toplift
who
was
a
rough
sort
of
a
man
certainly
wholly
unfit
for
the
command
of
a
vessel
manned
by
such
a
set
of
miscreants
and
employed
on
such
a
service
he
told
me
that
he
had
been
taken
three
years
before
by
a
pirate
vessel
and
finding
that
he
could
navigate
they
had
detained
him
by
force
and
that
at
last
he
had
become
accustomed
to
his
position
we
all
must
live
said
he
and
i
had
no
other
means
of
livelihood
left
me
but
it
sorely
against
my
conscience
and
that
the
truth
however
i
am
used
to
it
now
and
that
reconciles
you
to
anything
except
murder
in
cold
blood
and
that
i
never
will
consent
to
on
my
inquiring
where
they
were
about
to
cruise
he
said
on
the
spanish
main
but
said
i
it
is
peace
with
the
spaniards
just
now
i
hardly
knew
said
he
it
was
peace
not
that
peace
makes
any
difference
to
us
for
we
take
everything
but
you
refer
to
myself
i
know
and
i
tell
you
frankly
that
i
have
preferred
this
cruise
merely
that
we
may
not
fall
in
with
english
vessels
which
we
are
not
likely
to
do
there
i
wish
i
was
out
of
her
with
all
my
heart
and
soul
no
doubt
of
it
captain
toplift
i
think
you
are
sincere
suppose
you
put
into
one
of
the
inlets
of
jamaica
they
wo
know
where
we
are
let
us
take
a
boat
on
shore
and
leave
her
i
will
provide
for
you
and
you
shall
gain
your
living
in
an
honest
way
god
bless
you
sir
said
he
i
will
try
what
i
can
do
we
must
talk
the
matter
over
for
they
may
suspect
something
and
then
it
would
be
all
over
with
us
we
continued
to
run
down
till
we
were
in
the
latitude
of
the
virgin
isles
and
then
we
altered
her
course
for
jamaica
the
first
and
second
mates
generally
received
information
of
captain
toplift
as
to
his
movements
and
intentions
which
they
communicated
to
the
crew
if
the
crew
disapproved
of
them
they
said
so
and
they
were
considered
to
have
some
voice
in
the
matter
now
although
no
navigators
these
men
knew
enough
of
a
chart
and
a
course
to
find
that
there
must
be
some
reason
for
its
being
altered
as
it
was
instead
of
running
down
by
the
spanish
main
and
they
inquired
why
the
cruise
was
altered
captain
toplift
replied
that
he
had
taken
my
advice
and
that
i
had
assured
him
that
at
the
back
of
the
island
of
jamaica
we
should
certainly
fall
in
with
some
rich
spanish
vessels
if
we
lay
there
quiet
in
some
nook
or
another
for
a
short
time
as
this
was
their
time
for
coming
up
from
the
south
to
the
havannah
where
they
rendezvoused
for
a
convoy
this
reply
appeared
very
satisfactory
to
the
crew
for
they
were
all
cheerful
and
obedient
and
we
ran
down
to
jamaica
and
when
we
were
close
in
shore
we
shortened
sail
and
we
remained
three
or
four
days
in
the
offing
that
we
might
not
cause
any
suspicion
by
our
leaving
too
soon
captain
toplift
then
told
the
mates
that
i
proposed
anchoring
in
some
secret
bay
or
inlet
as
we
were
certain
to
see
the
spanish
ships
if
we
could
send
any
one
ashore
on
the
hills
to
look
out
for
them
this
was
agreed
to
and
we
made
sail
and
ran
along
the
coast
looking
out
for
some
convenient
anchorage
as
we
were
so
doing
a
vessel
hove
in
sight
and
we
immediately
made
all
sail
in
chase
as
she
did
not
attempt
to
avoid
us
we
hauled
off
as
she
came
near
to
see
what
she
might
be
she
then
hoisted
a
yellow
flag
at
her
peak
for
she
was
an
hermaphrodite
brig
this
puzzled
us
not
a
little
and
we
edged
down
towards
her
for
she
was
very
except
in
her
sails
as
we
neared
finding
i
suppose
that
we
did
not
answer
her
signals
and
we
were
not
the
vessel
she
expected
us
to
be
she
suddenly
altered
her
course
before
the
wind
setting
all
the
sail
that
she
possibly
could
we
immediately
crowded
canvass
in
chase
and
came
up
with
her
fast
as
we
ran
the
mate
and
i
looked
at
her
through
the
glass
and
i
made
her
out
to
be
the
transcendant
the
captain
of
which
had
treated
us
so
cruelly
when
we
were
in
the
boat
and
who
had
robbed
us
of
our
money
and
clothes
i
called
the
portuguese
and
desired
them
to
look
at
the
vessel
through
the
glass
and
give
me
their
opinion
they
directly
said
that
it
was
the
vessel
i
supposed
let
us
only
catch
the
rascal
said
i
and
we
will
pay
him
in
his
own
coin
and
i
immediately
gave
directions
for
the
better
trimming
of
the
sails
so
anxious
was
i
to
come
up
with
him
the
men
of
the
schooner
were
much
pleased
at
the
anxiety
i
displayed
to
come
up
with
the
chase
and
by
the
alacrity
with
which
they
obeyed
me
i
saw
how
anxious
they
were
that
i
should
be
their
captain
in
two
hours
we
were
within
and
sent
one
of
our
after
him
perceiving
that
it
was
useless
to
run
the
fellow
and
as
we
came
alongside
he
was
all
ready
with
his
boat
to
come
on
board
he
did
so
and
at
first
i
kept
out
of
sight
to
hear
what
he
would
say
he
was
followed
up
the
side
by
his
amiable
son
captain
toplift
received
him
on
deck
and
he
looked
around
him
saying
i
believe
i
am
right
i
was
afraid
i
had
made
more
mistakes
than
one
i
believe
you
are
in
the
free
trade
yes
replied
toplift
we
are
yes
i
thought
so
captain
but
i
expected
to
meet
another
schooner
which
is
very
like
to
yours
and
is
also
in
the
trade
i
made
my
signal
to
her
as
when
she
has
anything
to
get
rid
of
why
i
take
it
off
her
hands
perhaps
you
may
have
something
of
the
kind
which
is
not
exactly
safe
to
show
and
the
like
i
pay
ready
money
that
my
plan
as
it
afterwards
appeared
madam
this
scoundrel
had
been
in
the
free
trade
or
pirating
himself
for
many
years
but
he
had
taken
an
opportunity
of
walking
off
with
a
large
sum
of
money
belonging
to
the
pirate
crew
and
with
this
money
he
had
purchased
his
property
in
virginia
and
the
brig
which
he
now
commanded
although
he
did
not
follow
up
the
free
trade
any
more
he
had
made
arrangements
with
a
pirate
captain
whom
he
met
at
port
royal
to
meet
them
at
the
back
of
the
island
and
receive
such
articles
as
the
pirate
might
want
to
turn
into
cash
by
which
he
of
course
took
care
to
secure
large
profits
this
he
had
done
several
times
and
as
he
sold
his
cargo
at
port
royal
for
dollars
he
had
always
cash
to
pay
for
what
the
pirate
wished
to
get
rid
of
but
he
had
now
run
into
the
lion
jaws
for
not
only
were
i
and
the
portuguese
on
board
to
denounce
him
as
a
robber
but
what
was
still
more
unfortunate
for
him
three
of
the
pirate
crew
whom
had
he
swindled
out
of
their
property
were
also
on
board
of
us
and
recognised
him
immediately
as
captain
toplift
knew
how
i
had
been
treated
by
him
he
thought
it
was
time
he
should
be
confronted
with
me
and
to
his
question
as
to
whether
there
was
anything
to
dispose
of
he
replied
to
him
you
must
put
that
question
to
the
captain
there
he
is
the
fellow
turned
to
me
he
looked
at
me
stared
and
was
mute
when
his
cub
of
a
boy
cried
out
as
sure
as
a
gun
it
he
father
and
no
mistake
oh
you
imp
of
satan
you
know
me
do
you
replied
i
yes
it
is
he
send
all
the
men
aft
the
men
came
fast
enough
they
were
only
waiting
till
i
had
spoken
to
them
to
come
and
give
information
against
him
now
my
lads
said
i
this
is
a
scoundrel
who
fell
in
with
some
of
us
when
we
were
in
distress
after
we
had
lost
our
vessel
instead
of
behaving
as
one
seaman
does
to
another
he
robbed
us
of
all
we
had
and
turned
us
adrift
naked
to
be
killed
by
the
indians
of
all
i
and
the
two
portuguese
you
took
on
board
about
four
months
back
are
the
only
three
left
the
others
perished
the
one
who
was
with
me
was
burnt
to
death
by
the
indians
and
i
narrowly
escaped
i
leave
you
to
decide
what
this
scoundrel
merits
but
there
is
more
against
him
captain
said
the
men
and
then
four
of
them
stepped
out
and
declared
that
he
had
run
away
with
the
money
belonging
to
the
crew
of
which
they
were
a
part
and
that
the
sum
he
had
stolen
amounted
to
dollars
what
have
you
to
say
for
yourself
said
i
to
him
that
i
been
a
cursed
fool
to
be
caught
as
i
have
been
what
will
they
do
father
hang
us
i
suppose
replied
he
captain
toplift
said
i
i
do
not
command
this
vessel
and
i
shall
therefore
leave
you
to
decide
upon
the
fate
of
this
miscreant
and
having
said
that
i
was
going
below
to
the
cabin
when
the
captain
of
the
transcendant
son
ran
to
me
and
said
i
want
to
speak
to
you
sir
when
you
are
alone
what
are
you
after
peleg
cried
his
father
i
going
to
save
your
life
father
if
i
can
replied
he
you
be
clever
if
you
do
that
boy
said
the
man
sneeringly
i
allowed
the
boy
to
follow
me
down
into
the
cabin
and
then
asked
him
what
he
had
to
say
i
have
that
to
tell
you
which
is
of
more
value
than
the
lives
of
a
hundred
boys
like
me
boys
like
you
why
i
thought
it
was
to
save
your
father
life
that
you
came
down
sir
pooh
said
he
let
him
hang
he
was
born
for
a
halter
i
am
come
to
save
my
own
life
i
only
said
that
to
gammon
him
you
a
hopeful
youth
said
i
and
pray
what
is
that
you
can
tell
me
that
will
save
your
own
neck
from
the
halter
that
which
will
save
your
own
most
likely
replied
the
boy
and
all
fair
well
let
hear
it
then
replied
i
no
not
unless
you
promise
i
can
swing
if
need
be
as
well
as
father
but
i
rather
not
i
know
where
all
his
money
is
hidden
i
ca
make
any
promise
replied
i
then
i
ca
tell
replied
he
so
i
may
go
on
deck
and
tell
father
that
i
can
not
manage
it
and
as
he
said
the
latter
part
of
this
speech
the
undaunted
little
villain
actually
laughed
at
the
idea
of
gammoning
his
father
as
he
termed
it
train
up
a
child
in
the
way
he
should
go
and
he
will
not
depart
from
it
is
mostly
true
but
it
is
more
certain
that
if
you
train
a
child
up
in
the
way
that
he
should
not
go
he
will
be
a
more
true
disciple
could
there
be
a
more
decided
proof
of
the
above
than
the
behaviour
of
this
young
villain
but
his
father
had
made
him
so
and
thus
was
he
rewarded
stop
said
i
for
i
had
reflected
whether
after
all
there
were
any
grounds
for
hanging
the
boy
and
come
to
a
conclusion
that
a
jury
would
have
probably
acquitted
him
stop
said
i
you
say
that
what
you
can
tell
is
of
the
greatest
consequence
and
becomes
of
more
consequence
every
minute
that
passes
replied
he
i
will
tell
you
everything
and
let
you
into
father
secrets
i
peach
upon
father
altogether
well
then
replied
i
if
what
you
have
to
disclose
proves
important
i
will
do
all
i
can
to
save
your
life
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
i
shall
be
able
so
to
do
no
more
have
i
replied
he
or
i
would
not
have
come
to
you
now
then
father
came
to
the
back
of
the
island
to
do
a
little
business
with
a
pirate
schooner
as
he
said
just
now
and
he
has
very
often
done
it
before
as
he
said
just
now
but
father
did
not
tell
you
all
when
we
were
in
port
royal
father
went
to
the
captain
of
a
king
vessel
who
is
there
having
been
sent
to
put
down
the
pirates
if
possible
and
he
offered
this
captain
of
the
king
ship
for
a
certain
sum
to
put
our
friends
that
we
exchange
with
into
his
hands
what
betray
his
friend
the
pirate
yes
father
agreed
that
he
would
come
round
as
he
has
done
this
day
and
would
contrive
to
chaffer
and
bargain
with
him
and
keep
him
so
late
in
the
bay
that
the
king
ship
should
come
upon
him
all
of
a
sudden
and
take
him
and
this
was
father
intention
only
you
have
pinned
him
the
king
ship
will
be
round
that
point
in
two
hours
or
thereabouts
so
if
you
are
found
here
you
will
be
taken
and
handed
as
sure
as
i
hanged
yet
now
ai
this
important
news
and
worth
all
i
asked
for
it
it
certainly
is
if
it
is
true
boy
oh
i
prove
it
for
i
always
goes
with
father
and
he
trusts
me
with
everything
i
saw
the
paper
signed
the
king
ship
is
called
the
vestal
and
the
captain
who
signed
the
paper
signed
it
philip
musgrave
indeed
said
i
turning
away
for
i
did
not
wish
the
boy
to
perceive
my
emotion
at
this
announcement
i
recovered
myself
as
soon
as
i
could
and
said
to
him
boy
i
will
keep
my
promise
do
you
stay
below
and
i
will
go
on
deck
and
plead
for
your
life
may
i
go
on
deck
for
a
bit
said
he
what
to
wish
your
father
no
no
you
had
better
spare
yourself
and
him
that
painful
meeting
no
i
do
want
to
wish
him
i
wait
till
it
over
only
i
never
did
see
a
man
hanged
and
i
have
a
curiosity
to
have
just
a
peep
out
you
little
monster
cried
i
running
up
on
deck
for
the
information
i
had
received
was
too
important
not
to
be
immediately
taken
advantage
of
well
captain
has
the
boy
saved
his
father
life
no
replied
i
in
a
loud
voice
then
up
he
goes
said
the
men
for
the
halter
had
been
round
his
neck
and
run
out
to
the
for
some
time
and
the
men
had
manned
the
rope
only
awaiting
my
return
on
deck
in
a
second
the
captain
of
the
transcendant
was
swinging
in
the
air
and
certainly
if
ever
a
scoundrel
merited
his
fate
it
was
that
man
shortly
afterwards
i
turned
round
and
there
was
the
young
hopeful
looking
at
his
father
body
swinging
to
and
fro
with
the
motion
of
the
vessel
i
looked
in
vain
for
a
tear
in
his
eye
there
was
not
a
symptom
of
emotion
seeing
me
look
sternly
at
him
he
hastened
down
below
again
my
lads
said
i
to
the
men
who
were
all
on
deck
i
have
received
intelligence
of
that
importance
that
i
recommend
that
we
should
cut
that
vessel
adrift
and
make
sail
without
a
moment
loss
of
time
what
not
plunder
cried
the
men
looking
at
the
transcendant
no
not
think
of
it
if
you
are
wise
at
this
reply
all
of
the
men
exclaimed
that
that
would
not
do
that
plunder
they
would
that
i
was
not
the
captain
of
the
vessel
and
many
more
expressions
showing
how
soon
a
man
may
lose
popularity
on
board
of
a
pirate
vessel
i
gave
my
opinion
my
men
and
if
you
will
hear
why
i
said
so
no
no
out
boats
cried
they
all
and
simultaneously
ran
to
lower
down
the
boats
for
it
was
now
calm
that
they
might
tow
the
schooner
alongside
of
the
transcendant
you
might
as
well
talk
to
the
wind
as
talk
to
them
when
there
is
plunder
to
be
obtained
said
toplift
to
me
in
a
low
tone
come
down
with
me
said
i
and
i
will
tell
you
what
i
have
heard
ai
they
going
to
plunder
the
brig
said
master
peleg
when
we
came
down
i
know
where
father
dollars
are
and
up
he
ran
on
deck
i
made
a
short
remark
upon
the
depravity
of
the
boy
and
then
informed
captain
toplift
of
what
he
had
told
me
if
you
had
told
them
they
would
not
have
paid
attention
to
you
the
boat
crew
who
came
with
the
captain
have
told
them
that
there
is
money
on
board
and
all
authority
is
now
at
an
end
well
replied
i
i
believe
that
the
boy
has
told
the
truth
and
what
do
you
mean
to
do
remain
below
quietly
if
i
am
allowed
replied
i
but
i
can
not
said
he
they
would
throw
me
overboard
make
as
bad
a
fight
of
it
as
you
can
replied
i
that
i
will
said
captain
toplift
and
with
so
superior
a
force
opposed
we
can
not
stand
long
but
i
must
tell
you
where
you
must
be
where
replied
i
at
the
entrance
of
the
magazine
for
as
sure
as
we
stand
here
they
will
blow
up
the
vessel
rather
than
be
taken
not
all
of
them
but
two
or
three
i
know
are
determined
so
to
do
and
resolute
enough
to
do
it
my
pistols
are
there
you
have
only
to
open
this
door
and
you
are
in
the
magazine
passage
see
said
he
opening
the
door
there
is
the
scuttle
where
they
hand
the
powder
up
i
will
be
on
the
watch
depend
upon
it
and
captain
toplift
if
the
schooner
is
taken
and
i
am
alive
you
may
have
no
fear
for
yourself
now
let
us
go
on
deck
again
i
will
follow
you
replied
i
i
am
alone
at
last
thank
heaven
said
i
to
myself
what
a
position
am
i
in
and
how
much
will
be
in
suspense
before
hours
are
over
my
own
brother
here
not
ten
miles
perhaps
from
me
commanding
the
vessel
which
will
attack
this
on
which
i
am
on
board
that
they
will
take
us
i
have
no
doubt
but
what
risk
do
i
run
of
death
by
shot
or
by
their
blowing
up
the
vessel
in
spite
of
me
or
of
no
quarter
being
given
well
i
wish
it
were
decided
at
all
events
i
am
long
supposed
dead
and
i
shall
not
be
recognised
among
the
heaps
of
the
bodies
i
then
went
to
the
locker
and
took
out
my
duck
frock
and
trousers
determining
that
i
would
if
i
were
killed
be
killed
in
those
clothes
and
be
thrown
overboard
as
a
common
seaman
i
then
went
on
deck
for
i
heard
the
grating
of
the
sides
of
the
two
vessels
and
knew
that
they
were
in
contact
all
was
uproar
and
confusion
on
board
of
the
transcendant
but
there
was
nobody
on
board
the
schooner
except
toplift
and
myself
i
can
not
say
that
i
never
saw
such
a
scene
for
i
had
seen
quite
as
bad
on
board
of
a
privateer
the
common
seamen
as
well
as
the
soldiers
when
let
loose
to
plunder
are
like
maniacs
in
half
an
hour
they
had
broken
open
everything
cut
the
crew
to
pieces
and
found
out
the
hoard
of
dollars
which
was
shown
them
by
young
peleg
who
tried
for
his
share
but
for
so
doing
received
a
chop
with
a
cutlass
which
cut
off
his
right
ear
and
wounded
him
severely
on
the
shoulder
but
his
right
arm
was
not
disabled
and
while
the
man
that
out
him
down
was
bending
over
a
heap
of
dollars
which
took
both
hands
to
lift
them
the
boy
ran
his
knife
deep
into
the
man
side
who
fell
mortally
wounded
the
rush
for
the
dollars
thus
at
the
mercy
of
the
rest
was
so
great
that
peleg
was
not
minded
and
he
crept
away
and
came
on
board
the
schooner
we
saw
that
he
was
bleeding
profusely
but
we
asked
no
questions
and
he
went
down
the
ladder
forward
what
has
that
young
villain
been
after
said
toplift
i
presume
he
has
been
quarrelling
for
plunder
and
considered
that
he
had
a
greater
right
to
his
father
money
than
anybody
else
among
other
plunder
the
people
had
not
forgotten
to
look
for
liquor
and
an
hour
had
not
passed
before
of
the
men
were
more
or
less
intoxicated
they
had
found
plenty
of
good
clothes
and
were
strutting
about
with
waistcoats
and
embroidered
coats
over
their
dirty
frocks
the
uproar
increased
every
minute
when
toplift
who
had
been
looking
out
with
the
glass
exclaimed
there
she
is
by
all
sacred
i
caught
the
glass
out
of
his
hand
and
found
it
was
the
king
ship
she
was
a
large
flush
vessel
apparently
of
eighteen
or
twenty
guns
just
opening
from
the
point
and
not
seven
miles
from
us
we
were
still
becalmed
and
she
was
bringing
the
wind
down
with
her
so
that
to
escape
appeared
impossible
now
what
shall
we
do
said
captain
toplift
shall
we
allow
her
to
come
down
upon
us
and
say
nothing
to
the
men
or
shall
we
point
out
the
danger
and
persuade
them
to
come
on
board
and
prepare
you
must
do
as
you
please
replied
i
i
am
indifferent
which
it
will
be
dark
in
another
hour
and
she
will
not
be
down
by
that
time
i
would
rather
avoid
fighting
and
get
away
from
the
schooner
quietly
if
i
could
but
that
i
fear
is
impossible
now
well
i
must
go
on
board
of
the
brig
and
let
them
know
for
if
they
find
it
out
themselves
they
will
throw
us
overboard
captain
toplift
then
went
on
board
of
the
brig
and
railing
to
the
men
who
were
still
sober
told
them
that
there
was
a
king
ship
coming
down
upon
them
not
seven
miles
off
this
had
the
effect
of
putting
an
end
to
the
confusion
and
noise
of
a
great
portion
of
the
men
who
hastened
on
board
of
the
schooner
but
others
who
were
intoxicated
were
with
difficulty
persuaded
to
return
at
last
they
were
all
got
on
board
and
the
schooner
clear
from
the
brig
was
made
ready
for
action
but
toplift
was
obliged
to
make
some
alteration
in
the
stationing
of
the
men
as
those
who
were
to
hand
up
the
powder
were
all
of
them
tipsy
by
the
time
that
the
schooner
was
ready
and
the
breeze
had
come
down
to
her
the
corvette
was
not
more
than
three
miles
from
us
but
it
was
quite
dark
for
there
is
no
twilight
in
those
parts
we
consulted
what
course
we
should
take
to
avoid
her
if
possible
and
agreed
that
we
would
stand
in
shore
and
pass
her
if
we
possibly
could
we
knew
that
if
seen
we
were
then
certain
to
be
obliged
to
fight
but
if
not
seen
we
might
escape
we
then
shifted
the
helm
and
bore
up
across
her
bows
but
we
had
not
steered
in
this
direction
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
when
the
transcendant
was
perceived
to
be
on
fire
having
been
fired
by
the
drunken
men
before
they
left
her
and
soon
afterwards
she
burst
out
into
flames
that
threw
a
strong
light
to
a
great
distance
discovering
the
corvette
to
us
at
two
miles
distance
and
of
course
exposing
us
to
the
corvette
who
immediately
altered
her
course
for
us
we
had
therefore
only
to
fight
and
the
crew
being
most
of
them
in
liquor
declared
that
they
would
fight
till
the
schooner
sunk
under
them
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
corvette
being
close
to
us
and
standing
stem
on
we
opened
our
fire
raking
her
masts
and
yards
and
then
i
went
down
below
i
had
changed
my
clothes
for
the
duck
trousers
and
shirt
which
i
had
swum
on
board
in
and
i
now
remained
quietly
in
the
cabin
a
few
minutes
afterwards
the
corvette
opened
her
fire
and
the
shot
did
great
execution
the
cries
of
the
wounded
and
the
shouts
of
the
tipsy
men
were
mingled
together
but
the
crew
of
the
schooner
fired
with
great
rapidity
and
sustained
the
unequal
conflict
most
gallantly
after
a
time
some
men
darted
down
into
the
cabin
i
was
then
at
the
door
which
led
to
the
magazine
passage
and
busied
myself
handing
up
the
powder
as
it
secured
me
from
observation
and
it
was
supposed
that
i
was
one
of
the
crew
sent
down
for
that
duty
the
men
roared
out
where
is
the
captain
we
want
him
to
fight
the
ship
toplift
is
an
old
fool
and
do
know
what
he
is
about
i
made
no
reply
but
with
my
back
towards
them
continued
to
hand
up
the
powder
and
having
changed
my
dress
they
did
not
recognise
me
so
they
rushed
upon
deck
again
the
corvette
was
now
alongside
of
the
schooner
pouring
in
her
broadsides
with
fatal
execution
the
shot
passing
in
every
direction
through
her
so
that
there
was
as
much
danger
below
as
on
deck
and
it
was
evident
that
the
schooner
could
not
oppose
them
much
longer
still
they
continued
to
fire
with
great
resolution
being
now
sobered
into
more
steadiness
than
at
first
but
by
this
time
more
than
half
the
men
were
killed
and
wounded
and
our
guns
were
encumbered
with
the
wreck
and
bodies
i
heard
them
at
the
very
time
that
a
crashing
broadside
was
poured
in
by
the
corvette
cry
out
avast
firing
for
a
moment
and
clear
the
decks
they
did
so
and
having
thrown
the
bodies
overboard
and
cut
away
the
spars
and
rigging
which
had
fallen
so
as
to
enable
them
to
work
their
guns
during
which
time
three
broadsides
were
poured
in
they
remanned
their
guns
and
fought
with
as
much
spirit
as
before
i
could
not
help
admiring
the
courage
of
the
scoundrels
for
nothing
could
exceed
it
but
resistance
was
useless
further
than
they
preferred
dying
at
their
guns
to
being
hanged
on
the
gibbet
but
the
shouts
of
the
pirates
and
the
reports
of
the
guns
gradually
decreased
the
men
were
swept
away
by
the
enemy
fire
and
the
guns
were
one
by
one
disabled
the
schooner
sides
were
torn
out
and
the
water
poured
in
so
fast
that
it
was
rising
to
the
magazine
i
heard
a
cry
of
boarders
and
the
striking
of
the
two
vessels
together
and
then
there
was
a
rush
down
below
when
a
man
came
aft
to
the
magazine
passage
it
was
the
fellow
whom
i
had
struck
down
on
the
and
had
put
into
irons
come
along
said
he
to
the
others
we
send
the
corvette
and
ourselves
all
to
the
devil
together
out
of
the
way
there
stand
back
said
i
stand
back
replied
he
pointing
his
pistol
down
to
the
magazine
i
threw
up
his
arm
and
the
pistol
went
off
striking
the
beams
above
blast
you
cried
he
whoever
you
are
but
i
another
and
he
attempted
to
draw
it
out
of
his
belt
but
before
he
could
effect
it
i
blew
out
his
brains
with
the
pistol
which
i
had
ready
cocked
in
my
hand
his
companions
started
back
and
i
pointed
my
second
pistol
at
them
saying
the
man
who
comes
forward
this
way
dies
as
i
said
this
the
crew
of
the
corvette
who
had
cleared
the
decks
charged
down
below
and
the
pirates
ran
away
and
secreted
themselves
perceiving
them
coming
forward
i
said
to
them
put
a
guard
over
the
magazine
they
have
attempted
to
blow
up
the
vessel
already
who
are
you
said
an
officer
a
prisoner
replied
i
well
then
lead
him
on
deck
and
stay
here
two
of
you
shut
down
the
magazine
scuttle
and
keep
guard
thank
heaven
thought
i
that
this
affair
is
over
as
a
seaman
led
me
by
the
collar
on
deck
and
handed
me
to
others
who
took
me
on
board
of
the
corvette
we
were
all
put
down
below
that
remained
out
of
the
schooner
crew
about
eighteen
or
nineteen
not
more
and
i
was
glad
to
find
captain
toplift
although
badly
wounded
with
a
splinter
was
among
the
number
we
remained
there
huddled
together
with
a
guard
of
ten
men
over
us
for
more
than
an
hour
when
we
heard
from
the
conversation
on
deck
that
the
schooner
had
sunk
after
that
the
guns
of
the
corvette
were
secured
and
the
men
had
an
allowance
of
liquor
served
out
to
them
the
watch
was
called
and
all
was
quiet
during
the
remainder
of
the
night
for
some
time
i
was
in
a
state
of
excitement
from
the
events
of
the
last
hours
crowding
so
rapidly
but
by
degrees
i
became
calm
i
asked
one
of
the
guard
who
was
the
captain
of
the
corvette
what
that
to
you
you
replied
he
a
civil
question
might
receive
a
civil
reply
answered
i
so
it
might
with
any
one
else
but
if
you
do
want
the
hilt
of
my
cutlass
down
your
throat
you
will
hold
your
tongue
but
i
did
not
require
to
repeat
the
question
as
i
heard
one
of
the
officers
on
deck
say
it
captain
musgrave
orders
this
satisfied
me
and
i
lay
down
with
the
rest
of
the
prisoners
waiting
for
daybreak
when
i
trusted
my
troubles
would
soon
be
over
they
were
all
sound
asleep
strange
that
men
who
knew
that
they
would
be
hanged
in
a
few
days
if
not
the
next
morning
should
sleep
so
sound
but
so
it
was
while
i
who
had
every
reason
to
believe
that
my
sufferings
were
over
could
not
sleep
one
wink
i
was
however
fully
satisfied
with
my
own
during
the
night
and
more
satisfied
when
it
was
again
broad
daylight
after
the
men
had
had
their
breakfast
an
order
came
down
for
all
the
prisoners
to
be
brought
on
deck
we
were
led
up
under
guard
and
made
to
stand
all
in
a
row
i
looked
round
for
my
brother
but
he
was
not
on
deck
it
was
the
who
was
there
with
several
other
officers
and
the
clerk
with
pen
and
ink
to
take
down
the
names
of
the
prisoners
who
was
the
captain
of
this
vessel
said
the
i
was
sir
replied
toplift
but
much
against
my
will
oh
of
course
every
man
was
on
board
of
her
against
his
will
what
is
your
name
put
him
down
mr
pearson
any
other
officers
alive
no
sir
replied
toplift
the
name
of
every
man
was
then
asked
and
put
down
and
it
so
happened
that
i
was
the
last
for
anxious
to
see
my
brother
i
had
walked
up
the
foremost
and
they
had
commenced
their
interrogation
at
the
other
end
of
the
line
what
is
your
name
i
do
not
belong
to
the
schooner
replied
i
of
course
not
you
dropped
on
board
her
from
the
clouds
no
sir
i
did
not
i
swam
on
board
of
her
to
save
my
life
then
you
went
out
of
the
into
the
fire
i
reckon
my
good
fellow
for
your
life
is
forfeited
now
i
rather
think
not
sir
replied
i
on
the
contrary
i
feel
it
is
quite
safe
give
us
none
of
your
jaw
my
good
fellow
but
give
us
your
name
certainly
sir
if
you
require
it
my
name
is
alexander
musgrave
sir
replied
i
i
am
the
elder
brother
of
your
captain
philip
musgrave
and
i
will
thank
you
to
go
into
his
cabin
and
inform
him
that
i
am
here
the
and
officers
started
back
in
astonishment
and
so
did
captain
toplift
and
the
pirates
the
hardly
knew
whether
to
consider
it
as
a
pretence
on
my
part
or
not
and
was
undecided
how
to
act
when
captain
toplift
said
i
do
not
know
whether
the
gentleman
is
as
he
says
but
this
is
certain
and
all
the
men
can
prove
it
as
well
as
myself
that
he
did
swim
on
board
as
he
said
to
escape
from
the
indians
and
that
he
has
never
joined
the
crew
they
offered
to
make
him
captain
in
my
stead
and
he
positively
refused
it
yes
said
all
the
pirates
that
true
enough
well
sir
replied
the
i
will
certainly
carry
your
message
to
make
all
certain
replied
i
i
will
write
my
name
on
a
slip
of
paper
for
you
to
take
in
to
the
captain
he
knows
my
signature
i
did
so
and
the
took
the
paper
and
went
into
the
cabin
in
a
minute
he
returned
and
requested
me
to
follow
him
i
did
so
and
in
another
minute
i
was
in
the
arms
of
my
brother
for
some
time
we
neither
of
us
could
speak
at
last
philip
said
that
you
are
alive
and
well
let
me
thank
heaven
i
have
considered
you
as
dead
and
so
have
others
and
to
find
you
on
board
of
a
pirate
on
board
of
a
vessel
which
i
have
been
riddling
with
shot
any
one
of
which
might
have
caused
your
death
thank
god
i
was
ignorant
that
you
were
on
board
or
i
never
could
have
done
my
duty
i
will
not
ask
how
you
came
on
board
of
this
vessel
for
that
must
be
the
end
of
your
narrative
which
i
must
have
from
the
time
that
you
first
left
rio
and
afterwards
in
detail
the
whole
from
the
time
that
you
left
the
coast
then
they
received
my
letters
from
rio
yes
after
imagining
you
were
dead
they
were
rejoiced
by
those
letters
but
i
will
not
anticipate
my
story
nor
will
i
now
ask
for
yours
it
is
sufficient
at
present
that
you
are
alive
my
dear
alexander
and
once
more
in
my
arms
let
me
ask
one
question
replied
i
i
know
what
it
will
be
she
was
in
good
health
but
suffering
much
in
mind
from
having
no
account
of
you
her
father
and
others
have
reasoned
with
her
and
painted
the
impossibility
of
your
being
in
existence
as
the
xebeque
you
sailed
in
had
never
been
heard
of
she
still
adheres
to
the
opinion
that
you
are
alive
and
will
not
abandon
the
hope
of
seeing
you
again
but
hope
deferred
has
paled
her
cheek
even
more
pale
than
it
usually
is
and
she
evidently
suffers
much
for
her
life
is
wrapped
in
yours
now
having
told
you
this
you
must
come
into
my
and
allow
me
to
enable
you
to
appear
as
my
brother
ought
to
do
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
any
difference
in
our
size
now
although
there
was
when
we
last
parted
many
thanks
philip
but
before
i
adonise
my
outward
man
i
should
wish
to
satisfy
my
inward
cravings
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
so
hungry
from
not
having
broken
my
fast
for
nearly
hours
that
if
you
could
order
something
to
eat
while
you
are
looking
out
the
clothes
i
should
feel
in
no
small
degree
grateful
philip
rang
the
bell
and
ordered
the
steward
to
bring
something
to
eat
and
drink
and
after
eating
i
occupied
a
quarter
of
an
hour
more
in
getting
rid
of
the
pirate
smoke
and
dirt
and
putting
on
one
of
his
uniforms
for
he
had
no
other
clothes
on
board
when
i
came
out
looking
not
at
all
like
a
pirate
now
then
said
philip
before
we
have
our
come
out
with
me
and
let
me
introduce
you
to
the
officers
as
my
brother
i
went
out
with
him
and
was
formally
introduced
the
apologised
for
his
rough
speech
but
i
told
him
that
there
was
no
occasion
for
any
apology
as
i
had
no
doubt
that
i
looked
very
much
like
a
pirate
at
the
time
more
than
you
do
now
sir
at
all
events
replied
he
by
the
bye
brother
said
i
there
is
one
man
among
the
prisoners
who
although
compelled
to
act
as
captain
by
the
men
is
no
pirate
his
conduct
i
will
explain
to
you
may
i
request
him
to
be
kindly
treated
his
name
is
toplift
and
also
two
portuguese
my
former
companions
certainly
replied
philip
your
word
is
sufficient
let
those
persons
be
released
and
taken
care
of
said
he
to
the
we
will
wait
for
the
particulars
i
remained
on
deck
about
ten
minutes
and
then
returned
to
the
cabin
with
my
brother
what
is
this
which
you
have
left
on
my
said
philip
surveying
the
leather
bag
which
contained
the
diamond
that
philip
said
i
is
a
portion
of
my
narrative
and
eventually
may
prove
a
very
important
one
i
do
think
that
i
can
afford
to
make
you
a
present
of
it
but
i
shall
see
it
does
not
look
very
valuable
replied
he
at
all
events
do
me
the
favour
to
lock
it
up
carefully
replied
i
well
if
you
are
in
earnest
i
will
he
said
and
having
put
it
in
a
drawer
and
locked
it
up
he
said
now
alexander
let
me
have
your
history
i
commenced
and
told
him
all
that
the
reader
is
now
acquainted
with
dinner
broke
off
my
narrative
and
as
soon
as
it
was
over
i
resumed
it
when
i
had
finished
he
expressed
his
astonishment
and
asked
many
questions
among
others
he
said
and
that
little
wretch
peleg
the
captain
of
the
transcendant
son
is
he
on
board
i
have
not
seen
him
replied
i
and
therefore
presume
that
he
was
not
able
to
move
and
went
down
in
the
schooner
which
was
the
case
you
have
indeed
told
me
a
strange
tale
said
philip
and
you
have
had
some
extraordinary
escapes
you
must
have
a
charmed
life
and
you
appear
to
have
been
preserved
to
prove
that
amy
persuasion
of
your
being
still
alive
was
just
and
and
now
it
is
my
turn
to
talk
and
yours
to
listen
when
i
left
you
as
lieutenant
of
captain
levee
schooner
we
very
shortly
afterwards
had
an
action
with
a
spanish
vessel
of
very
superior
force
for
she
mounted
thirty
guns
having
no
chance
with
her
from
her
superior
weight
of
metal
we
threw
ourselves
on
her
bow
and
boarded
the
spaniards
did
not
relish
this
kind
of
close
fighting
and
gave
us
immediate
possession
of
their
deck
captain
levee
when
he
brought
in
his
prize
was
appointed
to
a
frigate
of
guns
and
i
followed
him
as
his
we
had
another
combat
with
a
vessel
of
equal
force
in
which
we
were
the
victors
and
i
was
sent
in
the
prize
captain
levee
wrote
very
kindly
in
my
behalf
and
i
was
made
a
captain
and
given
the
command
of
a
small
brig
but
let
me
first
finish
with
captain
levee
he
captured
a
galleon
which
gave
him
a
large
fortune
and
he
then
gave
up
the
command
of
his
ship
and
went
on
shore
telling
me
in
a
letter
that
he
had
hitherto
squandered
away
all
his
money
but
now
that
he
had
got
so
much
he
intended
to
keep
it
he
has
done
so
for
he
has
purchased
a
large
landed
property
is
married
and
i
believe
is
very
happy
he
deserves
it
replied
i
and
long
may
he
be
so
well
to
continue
i
was
sent
out
on
this
station
and
having
information
that
the
vessel
which
you
are
now
on
board
of
was
at
anchor
in
a
bay
close
to
the
havannah
i
ran
in
and
reconnoitred
she
hoisted
spanish
colours
and
i
did
the
same
it
fell
calm
and
i
lay
about
four
miles
outside
i
was
mistaken
for
another
spanish
vessel
and
the
captain
of
this
vessel
or
to
speak
correctly
the
spanish
captain
of
the
spanish
brig
came
out
to
see
me
and
did
not
discover
his
mistake
till
he
was
on
board
i
detained
him
and
his
boat
crew
it
continued
calm
till
the
evening
when
the
breeze
sprung
up
and
i
put
the
head
of
the
brig
right
for
the
bay
as
if
i
were
going
to
anchor
the
breeze
being
light
it
was
dark
before
i
got
in
and
alongside
this
vessel
they
were
completely
surprised
for
they
imagined
that
their
captain
was
dining
with
his
old
friend
and
having
no
idea
that
we
were
anything
but
spanish
had
not
the
least
preparation
for
resistance
we
had
possession
of
her
decks
before
they
could
seize
their
arms
and
i
brought
her
out
without
any
one
knowing
that
she
had
been
captured
on
my
arrival
the
admiral
gave
me
the
command
of
her
which
i
have
held
for
nine
months
but
she
is
very
defective
and
i
was
ordered
home
and
should
have
sailed
had
it
not
been
that
that
scoundrel
the
captain
of
the
transcendant
gave
me
the
information
which
induced
me
to
come
round
to
the
back
of
the
island
little
did
i
think
what
happiness
awaited
me
so
much
for
myself
do
not
think
me
an
egotist
for
speaking
of
myself
i
am
only
clearing
away
the
less
important
information
to
arrive
at
that
which
most
interests
you
the
amy
arrived
safe
with
her
valuable
cargo
the
captain
reported
that
he
had
remained
at
the
rendezvous
until
blown
off
by
a
sort
of
hurricane
and
that
finding
himself
a
long
way
off
he
considered
when
the
gale
had
ceased
that
he
was
not
justified
in
remaining
with
so
valuable
a
cargo
but
was
bound
to
make
the
best
of
his
way
to
liverpool
he
was
right
and
his
conduct
was
approved
of
by
mr
trevannion
who
looked
for
your
arrival
every
hour
at
last
a
week
passed
away
and
you
did
not
make
your
appearance
and
great
alarm
was
entertained
for
your
safety
the
weeks
grew
into
months
and
it
was
supposed
that
you
had
been
upset
in
the
same
hurricane
which
had
driven
the
amy
so
far
off
from
her
rendezvous
the
poor
girl
whyna
was
as
you
may
suppose
kindly
received
by
mr
trevannion
and
his
daughter
and
soon
gained
their
affection
but
she
pined
for
your
return
and
when
she
was
told
that
you
were
dead
she
never
recovered
it
the
climate
certainly
did
not
agree
with
her
and
she
contracted
a
very
bad
cough
during
the
winter
but
i
believe
from
my
heart
that
it
was
your
loss
which
affected
her
the
most
severely
after
she
had
been
about
eighteen
months
in
england
she
fell
into
a
consumption
and
died
poor
whyna
said
i
with
a
sigh
alexander
said
philip
perhaps
it
was
all
for
the
best
for
that
poor
girl
loved
you
sincerely
and
supposing
that
she
was
now
still
alive
and
living
with
miss
trevannion
and
on
your
return
your
marriage
should
which
of
course
unless
heaven
decrees
otherwise
it
will
take
place
that
poor
creature
would
have
been
very
unhappy
and
although
the
idea
of
her
being
a
rival
to
miss
trevannion
is
something
which
may
appear
absurd
to
us
yet
she
had
the
same
feelings
and
must
have
endured
the
same
pangs
as
any
other
woman
let
her
colour
be
what
it
may
i
think
therefore
that
her
removal
was
a
blessing
and
a
happy
dispensation
i
saw
mr
trevannion
and
his
daughter
but
once
previous
to
their
receiving
your
letters
from
rio
acquainting
them
with
your
misfortunes
and
happy
deliverance
from
slavery
they
were
both
very
dejected
and
mr
trevannion
talked
of
retiring
from
business
and
living
upon
his
property
near
liverpool
as
i
corresponded
regularly
with
amy
i
learnt
that
he
had
done
so
and
had
just
wound
up
his
affairs
when
your
letters
arrived
from
rio
with
an
order
on
the
portuguese
exchequer
for
a
considerable
sum
i
hardly
need
say
that
the
joy
occasioned
by
this
intelligence
was
great
amy
recovered
her
good
looks
and
her
father
bitterly
lamented
his
having
retired
from
business
as
he
had
wished
to
have
made
the
whole
over
to
you
the
money
you
remitted
from
rio
he
considered
as
your
own
and
he
also
set
apart
your
share
of
the
business
from
the
time
that
you
were
admitted
as
a
partner
he
was
not
aware
that
you
could
carry
a
diamond
of
such
immense
value
about
your
person
exposed
to
the
view
of
every
one
among
indians
settlers
and
pirates
that
my
delight
was
equal
to
theirs
you
will
i
am
sure
give
me
credit
to
believe
and
although
i
was
obliged
to
sail
for
the
west
indies
every
day
i
anticipated
receiving
a
letter
informing
me
of
your
arrival
in
england
judge
then
my
distress
at
first
receiving
letters
stating
that
you
had
not
been
heard
of
for
three
months
after
your
leaving
rio
and
expressions
of
fear
that
some
accident
had
happened
and
then
month
after
month
many
more
and
more
desponding
letters
in
which
mr
trevannion
plainly
stated
that
the
xebeque
must
have
foundered
and
only
amy
clinging
to
the
hope
that
you
were
still
alive
i
acknowledge
that
i
considered
you
dead
and
you
may
therefore
imagine
my
surprise
and
delight
when
your
signature
on
the
slip
of
paper
proved
that
you
were
not
only
in
existence
but
on
board
of
the
same
vessel
with
me
such
was
the
narrative
of
my
brother
philip
in
return
for
mine
and
it
was
late
at
night
when
we
parted
oh
how
sincerely
did
i
pray
that
night
thanking
heaven
for
all
its
mercies
and
entreating
that
the
cup
might
not
be
again
dashed
from
my
lips
when
i
arose
next
morning
i
found
that
philip
was
on
deck
and
i
followed
him
we
shall
soon
be
in
port
royal
with
this
wind
said
he
and
i
hope
to
find
the
admiral
still
there
i
had
some
conversation
with
the
officers
and
then
went
below
to
see
toplift
he
was
in
his
hammock
for
he
had
much
fever
and
suffered
from
his
wound
but
the
surgeon
said
that
he
would
do
well
toplift
said
i
you
must
keep
your
mind
at
ease
for
my
brother
has
promised
me
that
you
shall
not
be
tried
with
the
others
and
has
no
doubt
that
when
he
explains
the
whole
to
the
admiral
you
will
be
thanked
for
your
service
thanked
said
toplift
if
i
am
not
hanged
i
shall
be
fortunate
enough
no
fear
of
that
replied
i
so
keep
your
mind
easy
and
get
well
as
fast
as
you
can
well
then
sir
you
have
saved
my
life
at
all
events
for
had
you
not
come
on
board
no
one
would
have
ever
spoken
for
me
or
believed
that
i
was
not
a
pirate
in
heart
like
all
the
others
except
the
two
portuguese
if
necessary
they
will
be
evidence
in
your
favour
but
i
do
not
think
any
evidence
will
be
required
except
mine
and
that
will
be
sufficient
with
the
admiral
i
promised
you
that
you
should
never
want
the
means
of
getting
your
livelihood
and
i
repeat
that
promise
now
thank
you
sir
replied
he
and
i
then
left
him
and
went
up
to
the
cabin
to
breakfast
the
following
day
we
were
at
anchor
at
port
royal
my
brother
reported
what
had
occurred
and
the
admiral
sent
for
all
the
pirate
prisoners
except
toplift
whose
case
was
so
fully
represented
by
me
and
my
brother
that
he
was
permitted
to
go
at
large
and
to
take
a
passage
home
to
england
free
of
expense
if
he
wished
it
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
say
that
toplift
accepted
this
offer
and
remained
in
the
vessel
with
me
the
two
portuguese
were
also
liberated
three
days
after
our
arrival
we
sailed
for
england
and
after
a
quick
run
of
between
five
and
six
weeks
we
anchored
at
spithead
my
brother
could
not
leave
his
ship
and
i
therefore
requested
him
to
write
to
liverpool
stating
that
he
had
intelligence
of
me
and
that
i
was
alive
that
i
had
been
wrecked
and
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
indians
near
the
english
settlements
in
virginia
and
that
i
had
escaped
and
was
he
believed
at
james
town
i
considered
it
wise
to
make
a
communication
like
this
at
first
as
too
sudden
an
announcement
might
be
dangerous
to
one
in
so
weak
a
state
of
health
as
philip
stated
my
amy
to
be
from
the
letter
he
had
received
from
her
father
i
remained
with
him
at
portsmouth
until
the
reply
came
mr
trevannion
wrote
and
told
philip
that
his
communication
had
as
it
were
raised
his
daughter
from
the
grave
as
she
had
fallen
into
a
state
of
profound
melancholy
which
nothing
could
remove
that
he
had
very
cautiously
introduced
the
subject
and
by
degrees
told
her
what
was
reported
and
eventually
when
he
found
that
she
was
more
composed
that
he
had
put
philip
letter
into
her
hand
he
concluded
that
he
trusted
that
i
would
arrive
and
soon
for
if
any
accident
was
now
to
happen
to
me
it
would
be
the
death
of
his
daughter
who
had
not
strength
enough
left
to
bear
another
reverse
at
my
request
philip
then
wrote
that
he
had
received
a
letter
from
a
brother
officer
stating
that
i
was
well
and
safe
on
board
and
that
they
would
be
in
england
a
few
days
after
the
receipt
of
the
letter
leaving
directions
to
philip
how
to
proceed
i
now
went
off
to
london
and
having
fitted
myself
out
with
every
requisite
of
dress
and
toilet
i
called
upon
a
celebrated
jew
diamond
merchant
and
showed
him
my
diamond
requesting
that
he
would
weigh
it
and
then
estimate
its
value
he
was
much
astonished
at
the
sight
of
such
a
stone
as
well
he
might
be
and
after
weighing
it
and
examining
it
he
pronounced
it
worth
pounds
provided
a
purchaser
could
be
found
for
an
article
of
such
value
i
told
him
that
i
was
not
a
merchant
and
could
not
be
travelling
about
to
show
the
diamond
to
crowned
heads
but
if
he
would
give
me
a
liberal
price
for
it
i
would
abate
a
great
deal
that
he
might
dispose
of
it
to
his
own
advantage
he
requested
that
he
might
call
upon
me
with
two
of
his
friends
that
they
might
see
the
diamond
and
consult
with
him
and
then
he
would
give
me
an
answer
we
fixed
the
time
for
twelve
on
the
following
day
and
i
took
my
leave
the
next
day
he
called
at
the
time
appointed
accompanied
by
two
gentlemen
of
his
own
persuasion
they
weighed
the
stone
again
very
carefully
examined
it
in
the
light
of
a
powerful
lamp
to
ascertain
its
water
and
to
see
if
there
were
any
flaws
in
it
calculated
the
reduction
of
weight
which
would
take
place
in
cutting
it
and
after
a
consultation
i
was
offered
pounds
i
considered
this
an
offer
that
i
ought
not
to
refuse
and
i
closed
with
them
the
next
day
the
affair
was
settled
i
received
money
and
bills
on
government
to
the
amount
and
wrote
to
philip
telling
him
what
had
taken
place
strange
that
from
two
slaves
in
the
mines
i
should
have
received
such
valuable
legacies
from
poor
ingram
a
diamond
worth
so
much
money
and
from
the
other
englishman
a
tattered
bible
which
made
me
a
sincere
christian
a
legacy
in
comparison
of
which
the
diamond
was
as
dross
philip
replied
to
my
letter
congratulating
me
on
the
sale
of
the
diamond
and
informing
me
that
to
his
letter
he
had
received
a
reply
containing
so
satisfactory
an
account
of
amy
restored
health
that
he
had
written
to
tell
them
that
i
had
arrived
safe
in
england
and
would
be
very
soon
with
them
he
recommended
my
going
immediately
as
the
anxiety
and
suspense
would
be
very
injurious
to
amy
health
i
therefore
made
every
arrangement
for
my
departure
purchased
horses
and
procured
four
stout
well
armed
to
accompany
me
and
wrote
a
letter
which
i
sent
by
an
express
courier
stating
the
exact
day
which
i
expected
to
arrive
at
mr
trevannion
i
waited
in
london
two
days
to
wind
up
all
my
affairs
and
to
give
time
for
the
express
to
arrive
before
me
as
i
intended
to
travel
very
fast
my
stay
in
london
was
the
occasion
of
an
important
discovery
i
was
at
the
at
saint
paul
and
was
talking
with
one
of
captain
levee
officers
with
whom
i
had
picked
up
an
acquaintance
when
on
his
calling
me
by
the
name
of
musgrave
a
sort
of
looking
personage
in
a
black
suit
who
was
standing
at
the
turned
round
and
coming
up
to
me
said
sir
as
a
stranger
i
must
apologise
but
hearing
your
friend
call
you
by
the
name
of
musgrave
may
i
venture
to
ask
if
you
are
any
relative
to
sir
richard
musgrave
baronet
who
lived
in
cumberland
lived
did
you
say
sir
is
he
then
dead
yes
sir
he
has
been
dead
these
last
seven
months
and
we
are
looking
out
for
his
heir
and
can
not
find
him
i
knew
the
family
very
well
replied
i
for
i
am
connected
with
it
his
eldest
son
richard
of
course
must
be
his
heir
as
all
the
estates
are
entailed
his
eldest
son
richard
sir
is
dead
we
have
authenticated
documents
to
prove
that
and
moreover
his
second
son
charles
is
also
dead
he
came
home
very
ill
and
died
not
at
his
father
house
but
at
the
house
of
one
of
his
tenants
on
the
estate
it
is
his
third
son
alexander
musgrave
whom
we
seek
and
seek
in
vain
he
is
now
the
heir
to
the
baronetcy
and
estates
but
we
have
lost
all
clue
to
him
we
understand
that
a
captain
philip
musgrave
is
just
arrived
from
the
west
indies
he
is
we
presume
the
fourth
son
but
until
we
can
find
out
what
has
become
of
alexander
musgrave
and
whether
he
is
dead
or
alive
we
can
not
act
i
have
written
this
day
to
captain
musgrave
requesting
any
information
he
can
give
but
have
received
no
answer
i
presume
sir
it
is
useless
to
inquire
of
you
not
exactly
sir
for
i
am
the
alexander
musgrave
you
seek
indeed
sir
but
what
proof
have
you
of
your
identity
to
offer
to
us
the
evidence
of
my
brother
captain
philip
musgrave
in
whose
ship
i
have
just
arrived
from
the
west
indies
that
his
answer
to
your
letter
will
be
satisfactory
enough
i
have
no
doubt
here
is
a
letter
from
him
to
me
in
which
you
see
he
addresses
me
alexander
and
concludes
with
affectionate
brother
philip
musgrave
this
is
indeed
satisfactory
sir
replied
the
gentleman
and
i
have
only
to
receive
an
answer
from
your
brother
to
make
all
right
and
clear
allow
me
sir
to
congratulate
you
upon
your
accession
to
the
title
and
property
i
presume
you
will
have
no
objection
as
soon
as
the
necessary
proofs
are
obtained
to
accompany
me
down
to
cumberland
where
i
doubt
not
you
will
be
recognised
by
many
of
that
sir
i
have
not
the
slightest
doubt
replied
i
but
i
can
not
go
down
with
you
to
cumberland
at
present
i
leave
london
for
liverpool
the
day
after
on
important
business
and
can
not
disappoint
the
parties
well
sir
it
must
indeed
be
an
important
business
which
will
prevent
you
from
taking
possession
of
a
title
and
pounds
per
annum
replied
he
but
here
is
my
address
and
i
hope
i
shall
hear
from
you
as
soon
as
possible
as
i
shall
remain
in
town
till
i
can
bring
the
heir
down
with
me
the
man
now
looked
as
if
he
doubted
me
he
could
not
imagine
that
i
could
neglect
the
taking
possession
of
the
estate
for
any
other
business
and
it
did
appear
singular
so
i
said
to
him
sir
i
have
been
long
out
of
england
and
am
affianced
to
a
young
lady
who
lives
near
liverpool
she
has
been
waiting
to
hear
from
me
for
some
time
and
i
have
sent
an
express
to
say
that
i
will
be
with
her
on
such
a
day
i
can
not
disappoint
her
and
i
tell
you
more
that
without
i
possess
her
the
possession
of
the
title
and
estates
will
give
me
very
little
pleasure
sir
replied
he
making
a
bow
i
honour
your
sentiments
and
she
must
be
a
worthy
lady
who
can
inspire
such
feelings
i
only
hope
that
you
will
not
remain
too
long
at
liverpool
as
london
is
expensive
and
i
am
anxious
to
return
to
cumberland
i
then
wished
the
gentleman
farewell
and
went
home
to
my
lodgings
i
had
given
him
my
address
in
case
he
wanted
to
see
me
before
my
departure
the
next
day
i
received
a
letter
from
philip
enclosing
the
one
written
to
him
by
this
gentleman
whose
name
was
campbell
and
who
was
a
lawyer
philip
told
me
what
reply
he
had
made
to
him
and
congratulated
me
on
my
accession
to
the
title
and
estates
almost
an
hour
afterwards
mr
campbell
called
upon
me
with
philip
letter
which
he
declared
to
be
highly
satisfactory
and
sufficient
in
any
court
of
justice
but
said
he
i
would
wish
to
ask
you
a
few
particulars
and
i
also
would
wish
to
make
a
few
inquiries
mr
campbell
i
have
heard
your
name
in
my
youth
although
i
can
not
recollect
ever
having
seen
you
i
was
the
confidential
adviser
of
your
father
at
one
time
sir
replied
he
but
latterly
all
intercourse
had
ceased
it
was
not
until
he
was
on
his
and
fully
repented
the
foolish
step
which
he
had
taken
and
the
injustice
he
had
been
guilty
of
that
he
sent
for
me
much
to
the
annoyance
of
lady
musgrave
who
would
have
prevented
me
from
coming
into
the
house
even
when
i
arrived
had
it
not
been
for
the
servants
who
disobeyed
her
and
my
sisters
sir
janet
and
mabel
are
both
well
and
have
grown
up
very
fine
girls
your
father
destroyed
the
deed
by
which
lady
musgrave
was
to
have
had
a
large
jointure
upon
the
estate
and
she
is
now
entirely
dependent
upon
you
for
what
she
may
receive
when
do
you
expect
to
be
able
to
come
up
from
liverpool
i
can
hardly
say
but
of
course
as
soon
as
i
can
well
sir
my
own
affairs
will
require
my
presence
in
the
metropolis
for
a
month
in
the
mean
time
although
i
should
have
preferred
to
have
gone
down
with
you
to
faristone
hall
and
have
at
once
put
you
in
possession
yet
affairs
may
remain
as
they
are
for
everything
is
under
seal
and
lady
musgrave
has
been
compelled
to
remove
till
it
suits
your
convenience
i
shall
however
write
to
let
them
know
that
you
have
been
found
and
will
soon
come
down
and
take
possession
mr
campbell
then
asked
me
a
few
questions
to
which
i
replied
satisfactorily
and
then
for
the
first
time
he
saluted
me
with
my
title
saying
sir
alexander
i
will
now
take
my
leave
the
next
morning
i
set
off
on
my
journey
and
travelled
with
as
much
speed
as
the
horses
would
permit
i
arrived
on
the
fifth
day
at
mr
trevannion
seat
about
nine
miles
from
liverpool
as
i
rode
up
the
avenue
of
chestnut
trees
i
perceived
a
female
form
looking
out
from
an
upper
window
which
soon
afterwards
made
a
precipitate
retreat
i
alighted
and
was
received
at
the
door
in
the
embrace
of
mr
trevannion
who
welcomed
me
with
tears
and
taking
me
by
the
hand
he
led
me
into
an
apartment
where
i
found
my
adored
amy
who
threw
herself
into
my
arms
and
wept
as
if
her
heart
would
break
but
her
sobs
were
the
sobs
of
joy
and
when
she
did
raise
her
head
and
look
at
me
it
was
with
eyes
beaming
with
pleasure
and
with
smiles
upon
her
beautiful
lips
i
clasped
her
to
my
bosom
and
felt
that
i
was
more
than
repaid
for
all
i
had
suffered
and
my
heart
was
throbbing
with
gratitude
and
love
it
was
some
time
before
we
could
sufficiently
compose
ourselves
to
enter
into
lengthened
conversation
and
then
amy
inquired
what
had
occurred
to
me
to
occasion
such
lengthened
absence
we
sat
down
on
a
sofa
and
with
amy
on
one
side
of
me
and
her
father
on
the
other
i
entered
into
my
narrative
and
so
you
have
been
married
since
we
last
heard
from
you
said
amy
smiling
when
i
had
finished
my
history
yes
replied
i
i
have
been
but
i
hope
i
shall
treat
my
second
wife
a
little
better
than
i
did
my
first
i
hope
so
too
replied
amy
but
i
have
great
fear
that
your
virginian
mistress
may
come
over
and
claim
you
i
do
not
think
that
likely
from
the
indians
having
followed
me
to
the
beach
they
must
have
fallen
in
with
her
and
what
do
you
think
became
of
her
of
course
i
can
not
exactly
say
but
i
presume
she
died
gallantly
and
fought
with
her
axe
to
the
last
that
evening
i
had
a
long
conversation
with
mr
trevannion
he
told
me
what
he
had
done
with
the
money
which
he
considered
as
mine
and
i
put
into
his
care
the
sum
i
had
received
for
the
diamond
i
then
spoke
to
him
about
our
marriage
and
requested
that
it
might
not
be
postponed
my
dear
musgrave
said
he
my
daughter
happiness
so
depends
upon
her
union
with
you
that
i
can
only
say
i
am
willing
that
it
should
take
place
for
yourself
you
know
that
i
have
the
highest
esteem
and
that
you
must
be
convinced
of
when
i
have
consented
to
the
match
without
even
making
inquiry
as
to
your
family
and
connexions
now
however
is
the
time
that
i
should
wish
to
have
some
information
about
them
my
dear
sir
if
you
will
only
make
inquiries
you
will
find
that
the
family
of
musgrave
is
one
of
the
most
highly
connected
in
the
north
and
that
the
head
of
it
is
or
was
a
sir
richard
musgrave
baronet
of
faristone
hall
in
cumberland
i
am
a
near
relative
of
his
as
i
can
satisfactorily
prove
that
is
sufficient
replied
mr
trevannion
i
shall
leave
you
to
plead
your
cause
with
amy
so
now
good
night
the
following
day
i
told
amy
that
since
my
arrival
in
england
i
had
heard
of
the
death
of
my
father
and
that
it
was
necessary
that
i
should
go
to
the
north
as
family
affairs
required
my
presence
are
you
serious
replied
she
never
more
so
in
my
life
my
presence
is
absolutely
necessary
and
i
made
arrangements
with
the
legal
adviser
of
our
family
that
i
would
be
there
in
less
than
a
month
it
is
a
long
journey
said
mr
trevannion
and
how
long
do
you
stay
that
i
can
not
possibly
say
replied
i
but
not
longer
than
i
can
help
i
do
not
think
that
i
shall
let
you
go
said
amy
you
are
not
to
be
trusted
out
of
sight
you
are
so
born
for
adventure
that
you
will
not
be
heard
of
again
for
another
two
years
such
is
my
misfortune
i
grant
replied
i
but
amy
you
look
pale
and
thin
change
of
air
would
do
you
much
service
suppose
you
and
your
father
were
to
come
with
me
indeed
mr
trevannion
i
am
in
earnest
at
this
delightful
time
of
the
year
nothing
would
prove
so
beneficial
to
her
health
and
amy
then
you
know
that
i
shall
not
be
out
of
your
sight
i
should
like
the
tour
very
much
replied
she
but
i
know
what
you
would
say
you
do
not
like
the
idea
of
travelling
with
me
as
amy
trevannion
you
are
right
then
let
me
propose
that
you
travel
with
me
as
amy
musgrave
i
second
that
proposal
said
mr
trevannion
consent
amy
let
our
marriage
be
quite
private
i
know
you
will
prefer
that
it
should
be
so
and
so
will
your
father
you
will
then
travel
with
me
as
my
wife
and
we
never
shall
part
again
amy
did
not
reply
till
her
father
said
amy
it
is
my
wish
that
it
should
be
so
recollect
it
will
be
the
last
time
that
you
have
to
obey
your
father
so
do
not
annoy
me
by
a
refusal
i
will
not
my
dear
father
replied
amy
kissing
him
your
last
command
i
obey
with
pleasure
and
oh
if
i
have
sometimes
been
a
wilful
girl
forgive
me
everything
at
this
moment
my
dear
child
i
have
nothing
to
forgive
may
god
bless
you
and
mr
musgrave
said
he
putting
her
hand
in
mine
if
she
proves
as
good
a
wife
as
she
has
been
a
daughter
you
now
receive
a
treasure
and
i
felt
that
the
old
man
stated
what
was
true
it
was
arranged
that
the
marriage
should
take
place
on
that
day
week
and
that
it
should
be
quite
private
there
was
no
parade
of
bridal
clothes
in
fact
no
one
was
invited
and
it
was
at
my
request
quite
a
secret
marriage
a
clergyman
had
been
engaged
to
perform
the
ceremony
and
on
the
day
appointed
i
received
the
hand
of
my
amy
in
the
and
in
the
presence
only
of
humphrey
and
two
other
confidential
servants
after
the
ceremony
was
over
the
clergyman
requested
me
to
come
with
him
into
the
adjoining
room
and
said
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
give
a
certificate
of
the
marriage
which
must
be
inserted
in
the
parish
register
he
had
called
me
aside
for
that
purpose
that
i
might
give
him
my
exact
name
profession
etcetera
my
name
is
alexander
musgrave
as
you
have
heard
when
you
married
us
yes
i
know
that
but
i
must
be
particular
have
you
no
other
name
is
that
the
name
that
you
have
been
and
will
be
in
future
known
by
not
exactly
replied
i
i
have
been
known
by
that
name
but
in
future
shall
not
be
then
what
am
i
to
say
you
must
say
sir
alexander
musgrave
baronet
of
faristone
hall
cumberland
good
said
he
that
is
what
i
required
and
the
lady
your
wife
has
she
any
other
name
but
amy
none
i
believe
the
clergyman
then
wrote
out
the
marriage
certificate
and
signed
it
taking
a
copy
for
registry
and
we
returned
into
the
here
is
the
certificate
of
marriage
madam
said
he
it
ought
to
be
in
the
care
of
the
lady
and
therefore
my
lady
i
hand
it
over
to
you
my
lady
is
much
obliged
to
you
for
your
kindness
replied
amy
for
she
thought
that
the
clergymen
was
only
facetious
she
held
the
certificate
in
her
hand
folded
as
it
had
been
given
her
for
some
time
at
last
curiosity
or
perhaps
having
nothing
else
to
do
induced
her
to
open
it
and
read
it
i
was
at
this
time
talking
with
the
clergyman
and
presenting
him
with
a
handsome
douceur
for
his
trouble
but
perceiving
her
to
open
the
certificate
i
watched
her
countenance
she
read
and
started
i
turned
away
as
if
not
observing
her
she
then
went
up
to
her
father
and
desired
him
to
read
it
the
old
gentleman
took
out
his
glasses
and
it
was
amusing
to
see
the
way
in
which
he
looked
at
his
daughter
with
his
spectacles
falling
off
his
nose
he
then
came
up
and
pointing
to
the
certificate
said
pray
how
am
i
in
future
to
address
my
daughter
as
amy
i
trust
sir
unless
you
wish
to
scold
her
and
then
you
must
call
her
lady
musgrave
i
am
my
dear
sir
as
the
certificate
states
sir
alexander
musgrave
of
faristone
with
a
handsome
property
descended
to
me
i
did
not
know
it
till
i
arrived
in
london
and
if
i
concealed
it
from
you
till
now
it
was
only
that
my
amy
should
have
the
satisfaction
of
proving
to
me
that
she
wedded
me
in
pure
disinterestedness
of
affection
it
was
very
very
kind
of
you
alexander
to
do
as
you
have
done
and
i
thank
you
sincerely
for
it
and
now
my
dear
amy
you
understand
why
i
wished
you
to
come
with
me
to
cumberland
that
you
may
take
possession
of
your
future
abode
and
assume
that
position
in
society
which
you
will
so
much
grace
i
trust
sir
continued
i
that
you
will
not
part
from
us
and
that
one
roof
will
always
cover
us
as
long
as
heaven
thinks
fit
to
spare
our
lives
may
god
bless
you
both
replied
mr
trevannion
i
can
not
part
with
you
and
must
follow
about
half
an
hour
after
this
i
requested
amy
and
mr
trevannion
to
sit
by
me
as
i
had
now
another
narrative
to
give
them
which
was
an
explanation
why
and
how
it
was
that
they
found
me
in
the
position
that
they
had
done
in
short
what
were
the
causes
that
induced
me
and
afterwards
my
brother
philip
to
quit
our
parental
roof
and
to
come
to
the
resolution
of
fighting
our
own
way
in
the
world
it
was
as
follows
sir
richard
musgrave
my
father
married
a
young
lady
of
high
connexion
a
miss
arabella
johnson
and
with
her
lived
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
a
very
happy
life
for
nearly
years
when
it
pleased
god
to
summon
her
away
i
have
a
good
recollection
of
my
mother
for
although
i
lived
with
my
brother
at
a
private
tutor
about
six
miles
off
i
was
continually
at
home
and
she
did
not
die
till
i
was
nearly
sixteen
and
i
can
only
say
that
a
more
elegant
amiable
and
truly
virtuous
woman
as
i
believe
never
existed
by
this
marriage
my
father
had
four
sons
and
two
daughters
richard
the
eldest
charles
the
second
myself
the
third
and
philip
the
fourth
and
my
sisters
who
came
last
were
named
janet
and
mabel
at
the
time
of
my
death
my
eldest
brother
was
serving
with
the
army
which
he
had
entered
from
a
love
of
the
profession
although
as
heir
to
the
baronetcy
and
estates
which
are
a
clear
pounds
per
annum
he
of
course
had
no
occasion
for
a
profession
my
second
brother
charles
being
of
an
adventurous
turn
had
gone
out
to
the
east
indies
in
a
high
position
as
servant
to
the
company
i
was
still
at
home
as
well
as
philip
who
is
four
years
my
junior
and
my
sisters
were
of
course
at
home
i
pass
over
my
regrets
at
my
mother
death
and
will
now
speak
more
of
my
father
he
was
a
weak
man
easily
led
and
although
during
my
mother
lifetime
he
was
so
well
led
that
it
was
of
little
consequence
the
case
proved
very
different
at
her
death
for
a
year
my
father
remained
quiet
in
the
house
content
with
superintending
his
improvements
on
his
property
and
he
had
lately
become
infirm
and
had
given
up
the
hounds
and
rural
sports
in
general
the
dairy
was
one
of
his
principal
hobbies
and
it
so
happened
that
a
young
girl
the
daughter
of
a
labourer
was
one
of
the
females
employed
in
that
part
of
the
establishment
she
was
certainly
remarkably
her
features
were
very
small
and
she
did
not
show
that
robust
frame
which
people
in
her
class
of
life
generally
do
she
was
about
seventeen
years
old
slight
in
figure
and
certainly
a
person
that
you
would
not
pass
without
making
some
commendatory
remark
upon
her
good
looks
and
modest
appearance
she
was
not
however
what
she
appeared
she
was
beyond
measure
cunning
and
astute
and
as
it
proved
inordinately
ambitious
my
father
who
was
naturally
of
an
amorous
disposition
was
attracted
by
her
and
very
soon
was
constantly
in
the
dairy
and
his
attentions
were
so
marked
that
the
other
servants
used
to
call
her
lady
a
few
months
after
my
father
had
shown
a
preference
for
this
girl
he
was
seized
with
his
first
attack
of
gout
it
did
not
last
him
long
and
in
six
weeks
he
was
about
again
and
resumed
his
attentions
to
her
philip
and
i
who
were
at
our
tutor
when
we
came
home
heard
from
others
what
was
going
on
and
very
foolishly
played
the
girl
many
tricks
and
annoyed
her
as
much
as
we
could
after
we
returned
my
father
had
another
fit
of
gout
and
when
he
was
confined
to
his
room
he
desired
this
girl
to
be
sent
for
to
attend
upon
him
i
can
not
say
what
took
place
but
this
is
certain
that
my
father
unfortunate
passion
became
so
great
and
i
presume
the
girl
ambition
rose
in
proportion
that
about
six
months
afterwards
this
daughter
of
a
menial
was
raised
to
the
dignity
of
lady
musgrave
she
being
at
that
time
about
eighteen
and
my
father
verging
on
seventy
when
this
and
disgraceful
connexion
was
known
the
gentry
and
aristocracy
of
the
country
refused
any
longer
to
visit
my
father
and
all
communication
was
broken
off
in
a
short
time
the
ascendency
which
this
artful
girl
gained
over
the
old
man
was
most
wonderful
he
lived
but
in
her
sight
and
knew
no
will
but
hers
her
father
and
family
were
removed
to
a
good
house
in
the
neighbourhood
and
gave
themselves
all
the
airs
of
gentlepeople
the
good
old
steward
was
dismissed
and
her
father
established
in
his
room
although
the
man
could
not
read
or
write
and
was
wholly
unfit
for
the
office
the
expense
which
she
launched
out
into
by
his
permission
was
excessive
new
liveries
new
coaches
diamonds
and
dresses
fit
for
the
court
indeed
every
kind
of
luxury
that
could
be
conceived
and
much
greater
than
my
father
could
afford
she
now
showed
herself
in
her
true
colours
vindictive
and
tyrannical
to
excess
she
dismissed
all
the
old
servants
and
oppressed
all
those
to
whom
she
owed
a
grudge
yet
my
poor
father
could
see
nothing
but
perfection
in
her
it
was
not
till
four
months
after
the
marriage
that
philip
and
i
came
home
and
our
new
had
not
forgotten
our
treatment
of
her
she
treated
us
with
great
harshness
refused
our
taking
meals
at
my
father
table
and
ordered
us
the
coarsest
fare
and
when
we
complained
to
my
father
denied
everything
that
we
said
as
we
found
that
we
could
not
induce
our
father
to
listen
to
us
or
to
believe
us
we
tried
all
we
could
and
retaliated
and
annoyed
her
as
much
if
not
more
than
she
annoyed
us
by
talking
of
her
mean
origin
and
her
former
occupation
we
defied
her
and
in
so
doing
we
ruined
ourselves
for
after
a
useless
struggle
on
my
father
part
he
gave
way
to
her
imperious
commands
and
sending
for
me
told
me
that
i
had
become
such
a
reprobate
that
i
was
no
longer
a
son
of
his
he
threw
me
a
purse
telling
me
that
it
was
all
i
might
expect
from
him
and
that
i
was
instantly
to
leave
the
house
and
never
show
my
face
in
it
any
more
i
replied
with
more
spirit
than
respect
that
it
was
high
time
that
the
son
of
a
gentleman
and
lady
should
leave
the
house
when
such
creatures
were
installed
in
it
as
the
mistress
my
father
in
a
rage
flung
his
crutch
at
my
head
and
i
left
the
room
as
i
went
out
i
met
her
in
the
passage
she
had
evidently
been
listening
to
what
had
passed
and
she
was
full
of
exultation
is
your
turn
now
you
said
i
in
my
rage
wait
till
my
father
dies
you
shall
go
again
i
do
not
mean
to
defend
my
conduct
but
i
was
then
not
seventeen
and
that
must
be
my
excuse
i
little
thought
when
i
said
so
that
it
would
be
from
my
hands
that
she
would
have
to
receive
bounty
but
so
it
is
as
mr
campbell
informs
me
that
my
father
destroyed
previous
to
his
death
the
papers
which
he
had
signed
to
secure
her
a
large
jointure
on
the
estate
i
set
off
with
my
wardrobe
and
the
purse
of
twenty
guineas
which
my
father
had
given
me
and
having
a
desire
to
see
the
world
i
went
on
board
of
a
merchant
vessel
six
months
afterwards
when
we
were
at
liverpool
i
went
on
board
of
a
privateer
the
remainder
of
my
history
you
are
already
acquainted
with
as
soon
as
she
had
wreaked
her
vengeance
upon
me
my
brother
philip
was
the
next
but
he
was
too
young
at
that
time
to
be
turned
adrift
so
she
put
it
off
till
the
time
should
come
irritating
and
weaning
my
father
from
him
by
every
means
in
her
power
three
years
afterwards
she
succeeded
in
having
him
dismissed
also
and
you
know
how
i
found
him
out
all
these
circumstances
were
very
in
the
neighbourhood
and
to
our
own
relations
and
one
only
my
aunt
called
upon
my
father
and
after
a
long
conversation
my
father
consented
that
my
sisters
should
go
away
and
remain
under
her
charge
my
violent
temper
her
exactions
her
imperious
conduct
which
was
now
shown
even
towards
him
with
what
my
aunt
had
advanced
had
to
a
certain
extent
opened
my
father
eyes
he
perceived
that
she
had
no
other
view
but
her
own
aggrandisement
and
that
she
cared
little
for
him
her
repeated
attempts
however
to
make
him
sign
in
her
favour
in
case
of
his
death
were
successful
and
it
was
not
till
after
her
conduct
had
alienated
him
from
her
and
he
deplored
the
loss
of
his
children
that
he
committed
the
deed
to
the
flames
about
three
years
after
i
had
quitted
the
house
my
eldest
brother
who
had
information
of
all
that
had
passed
and
who
remained
in
the
army
because
he
declared
that
he
never
would
go
home
till
after
his
father
death
was
killed
by
a
and
my
second
brother
died
of
a
fever
about
a
year
ago
when
resident
at
the
court
of
a
native
prince
i
had
heard
nothing
of
these
deaths
or
of
my
father
until
my
arrival
in
london
of
course
i
was
most
anxious
to
go
down
to
cumberland
if
it
were
only
to
undo
the
wickedness
which
this
woman
had
done
and
to
make
amends
to
those
whom
she
had
so
cruelly
treated
i
do
not
feel
any
spirit
of
revenge
but
i
feel
that
justice
demands
it
of
me
and
i
shall
go
with
you
with
pleasure
to
help
you
in
your
good
work
said
amy
and
also
because
i
want
to
see
how
she
will
now
behave
to
one
whom
she
has
so
persecuted
and
who
has
become
the
arbiter
of
her
fate
well
amy
i
will
not
trust
myself
on
this
question
you
shall
be
the
arbitress
of
her
fate
and
what
you
decide
shall
be
irrevocable
i
fully
appreciate
the
compliment
you
pay
me
said
she
but
i
prefer
that
it
should
be
decided
in
council
and
we
will
call
in
my
father
to
our
assistance
a
fortnight
after
our
marriage
we
set
off
for
london
in
a
coach
with
six
handsome
black
horses
and
eight
armed
servants
in
liveries
on
horseback
we
arrived
safely
on
the
seventh
day
and
there
we
reposed
for
a
time
previous
to
setting
out
for
cumberland
my
aunt
was
in
london
and
attending
the
court
which
i
was
not
aware
of
and
with
her
were
my
two
sisters
janet
and
mabel
whom
i
had
not
seen
for
years
and
who
warmly
embraced
me
promising
that
they
would
soon
come
down
and
take
up
their
abode
at
the
hall
they
expressed
their
admiration
of
amy
but
in
so
doing
they
only
followed
the
general
opinion
for
it
was
impossible
to
see
and
not
admire
her
elegance
and
beauty
my
aunt
showed
us
every
attention
and
we
were
presented
to
his
majesty
who
was
pleased
to
compliment
lady
musgrave
in
very
flattering
terms
we
were
joined
in
london
by
my
brother
philip
who
had
paid
off
his
ship
and
the
day
after
he
joined
us
i
said
philip
there
are
only
you
and
i
left
do
you
recollect
when
you
inquired
about
the
diamond
the
day
we
met
on
board
of
your
ship
what
reply
i
made
to
you
yes
you
said
that
you
were
afraid
that
you
could
not
afford
to
make
me
a
present
of
it
at
that
time
i
did
not
think
so
philip
but
now
i
know
that
i
can
and
i
have
desired
mr
trevannion
to
put
out
to
good
security
the
pounds
that
the
diamond
was
sold
for
in
your
name
and
for
your
use
you
not
hesitate
to
accept
it
philip
for
you
know
that
i
can
afford
it
i
do
not
hesitate
my
dear
alexander
because
i
would
do
the
same
to
you
and
you
would
not
refuse
me
at
the
same
time
that
is
no
reason
that
i
should
not
thank
you
kindly
for
your
generous
behaviour
philip
accompanied
us
on
our
journey
to
cumberland
it
was
tedious
for
the
roads
were
anything
but
good
but
the
beauty
of
the
scenery
compensated
for
the
ruggedness
of
the
way
in
six
days
we
arrived
at
the
hall
where
mr
campbell
who
had
called
upon
me
on
my
arrival
in
london
had
preceded
me
to
make
preparations
for
our
reception
which
was
enthusiastic
to
the
highest
degree
we
were
called
upon
and
congratulated
by
all
the
county
who
were
delighted
to
find
that
such
a
personage
as
amy
was
to
be
the
future
mistress
as
soon
as
all
this
bustle
and
excitement
was
over
i
sat
down
with
mr
campbell
to
look
over
the
state
of
affairs
and
to
set
things
to
rights
after
having
done
justice
to
many
claimants
engaged
again
the
old
servants
that
had
been
discharged
promised
farms
to
the
tenants
who
had
been
unfairly
turned
out
etcetera
we
then
proceeded
to
decide
upon
what
was
to
be
done
to
the
dowager
lady
musgrave
it
appears
that
at
my
father
death
when
she
found
that
the
deed
had
been
destroyed
by
his
own
hands
in
presence
of
others
she
became
frantic
with
rage
and
immediately
hastened
to
secure
the
family
jewels
and
every
article
of
value
that
she
could
lay
her
hands
upon
but
mr
campbell
having
due
notice
of
what
she
was
about
came
in
time
to
prevent
her
taking
them
away
and
putting
seals
upon
everything
and
leaving
careful
guards
in
the
hall
my
lady
had
gone
to
her
father
house
where
she
still
remained
she
had
on
my
arrival
sent
me
a
message
imploring
my
mercy
and
reminding
me
that
whatever
might
be
her
errors
she
was
still
the
lawful
wife
of
my
father
and
she
trusted
that
respect
to
his
memory
would
induce
me
to
allow
her
sufficient
to
maintain
her
as
lady
musgrave
should
be
we
had
the
consultation
that
amy
proposed
and
called
in
mr
campbell
as
a
fourth
and
it
was
at
last
decided
that
on
consideration
that
she
removed
with
her
family
to
a
distance
of
fifty
miles
from
faristone
she
should
have
an
income
of
pounds
per
annum
as
long
as
she
conducted
herself
with
propriety
and
did
not
marry
again
the
last
clause
was
the
only
one
which
she
complained
of
mr
campbell
had
at
the
request
of
my
father
discharged
lady
musgrave
parent
from
the
office
of
steward
and
called
in
the
old
steward
to
resume
his
situation
and
before
dismissal
he
had
to
refund
certain
sums
of
money
not
accounted
for
i
have
now
told
my
eventful
tale
i
have
only
to
add
that
after
all
that
i
have
passed
through
i
have
been
rewarded
by
many
years
of
unalloyed
happiness
my
two
sisters
are
well
married
and
my
three
children
are
all
that
a
father
could
wish
such
my
dear
madam
have
been
the
vicissitudes
of
a
privateersman
and
i
now
subscribe
myself
your
most
obedient
alexander
musgrave
the
end
