the

return
its
warmest
thanks
to
the
said
samuel
pickwick
for
the
same
that
while
this
association
is
deeply
sensible
of
the
advantages
which
must
accrue
to
the
cause
of
science
from
the
production
to
which
they
have
just
adverted
no
less
than
from
the
unwearied
researches
of
samuel
pickwick
in
hornsey
highgate
brixton
and
camberwell
they
can
not
but
entertain
a
lively
sense
of
the
inestimable
benefits
which
must
inevitably
result
from
carrying
the
speculations
of
that
learned
man
into
a
wider
field
from
extending
his
travels
and
consequently
enlarging
his
sphere
of
observation
to
the
advancement
of
knowledge
and
the
diffusion
of
learning
that
with
the
view
just
mentioned
this
association
has
taken
into
its
serious
consideration
a
proposal
emanating
from
the
aforesaid
samuel
pickwick
and
three
other
pickwickians
hereinafter
named
for
forming
a
new
branch
of
united
pickwickians
under
the
title
of
the
corresponding
society
of
the
pickwick
club
that
the
said
proposal
has
received
the
sanction
and
approval
of
this
association
that
the
corresponding
society
of
the
pickwick
club
is
therefore
hereby
constituted
and
that
samuel
pickwick
tracy
tupman
augustus
snodgrass
and
nathaniel
winkle
are
hereby
nominated
and
appointed
members

requested
to

from
time
to
time
authenticated
accounts
of
their
journeys
and
investigations
of
their
observations
of
character
and
manners
and
of
the
whole
of
their
adventures
together
with
all
tales
and
papers
to
which
local
scenery
or
associations
may
give
rise
to
the
pickwick
club
stationed
in
london
that
this
association
cordially
recognises
the
principle
of
every
member
of
the
corresponding
society
defraying
his
own
travelling
expenses
and
that
it
sees
no
objection
whatever
to
the
members
of
the
said
society
pursuing
their
inquiries
for
any
length
of
time
they
please
upon
the
same
terms
that
the
members
of
the
aforesaid
corresponding
society
be
and
are
hereby
informed
that
their
proposal
to
pay
the
postage
of
their
letters
and
the
carriage
of
their
parcels
has
been
deliberated
upon
by
this
association
that
this
association
considers
such
proposal
worthy
of
the
great
minds
from
which
it
emanated
and
that
it
hereby
signifies
its
perfect
acquiescence
a
casual
observer
adds
the
secretary
to
whose
notes
we
are
indebted
for
the
following
account
a
casual
observer
might
possibly
have
remarked
nothing
extraordinary
in
the
bald
head
and
circular
spectacles
which
were
intently
turned
towards
his
the
secretary
s
face
during
the
reading
of
the
above
resolutions
to
those
who
knew
that
the
gigantic
brain
of
pickwick
was
working
beneath
that
forehead
and
that
the
beaming
eyes
of
pickwick
were
twinkling
behind
those
glasses
the
sight
was
indeed
an
interesting
one
there
sat
the
man
who
had
traced
to
their
source
the
mighty
ponds
of
hampstead
and
agitated
the
scientific
world
with
his
theory
of
tittlebats
as
calm
and
unmoved
as
the
deep
waters
of
the
one
on
a
frosty
day
or
as
a
solitary
specimen
of
the
other
in
the
inmost
recesses
of
an
earthen
jar
and
how
much
more
interesting
did
the
spectacle
become
when
starting
into
full
life
and
animation
as
a
simultaneous
call
for
pickwick
burst
from
his
followers
that
illustrious
man
slowly
mounted
into
the
windsor
chair
on
which
he
had
been
previously
seated
and
addressed
the
club
himself
had
founded
what
a
study
for
an
artist
did
that
exciting
scene
present
the
eloquent
pickwick
with
one
hand
gracefully
concealed
behind
his
coat
tails
and
the
other
waving
in
air
to
assist
his
glowing
declamation
his
elevated
position
revealing
those
tights
and
gaiters
which
had
they
clothed
an
ordinary
man
might
have
passed
without
observation
but
which
when
pickwick
clothed
them
if
we
may
use
the
expression
inspired
involuntary
awe
and
respect
surrounded
by
the
men
who
had
volunteered
to
share
the
perils
of
his
travels
and
who
were
destined
to
participate
in
the
glories
of
his
discoveries
on
his
right
sat
tracy
tupman
the
too
susceptible
tupman
who
to
the
wisdom
and
experience
of
maturer
years
superadded
the
enthusiasm
and
ardour
of
a
boy
in
the
most
interesting
and
pardonable
of
human
weaknesses
love
time
and
feeding
had
expanded
that
once
romantic
form
the
black
silk
waistcoat
had
become
more
and
more
developed
inch
by
inch
had
the
gold
beneath
it
disappeared
from
within
the
range
of
tupman
s
vision
and
gradually
had
the
capacious
chin
encroached
upon
the
borders
of
the
white
cravat
but
the
soul
of
tupman
had
known
no
change
admiration
of
the
fair
sex
was
still
its
ruling
passion
on
the
left
of
his
great
leader
sat
the
poetic
snodgrass
and
near
him
again
the
sporting
winkle
the
former
poetically
enveloped
in
a
mysterious
blue
cloak
with
a
collar
and
the
latter
communicating
additional
lustre
to
a
new
green
plaid
neckerchief
and
fitted
drabs
pickwick
s
oration
upon
this
occasion
together
with
the
debate
thereon
is
entered
on
the
transactions
of
the
club
both
bear
a
strong
affinity
to
the
discussions
of
other
celebrated
bodies
and
as
it
is
always
interesting
to
trace
a
resemblance
between
the
proceedings
of
great
men
we
transfer
the
entry
to
these
pages
mr
pickwick
observed
says
the
secretary
that
fame
was
dear
to
the
heart
of
every
man
poetic
fame
was
dear
to
the
heart
of
his
friend
snodgrass
the
fame
of
conquest
was
equally
dear
to
his
friend
tupman
and
the
desire
of
earning
fame
in
the
sports
of
the
field
the
air
and
the
water
was
uppermost
in
the
breast
of
his
friend
winkle
he
pickwick
would
not
deny
that
he
was
influenced
by
human
passions
and
human
feelings
cheers
possibly
by
human
weaknesses
loud
cries
of
no
but
this
he
would
say
that
if
ever
the
fire
of
broke
out
in
his
bosom
the
desire
to
benefit
the
human
race
in
preference
effectually
quenched
it
the
praise
of
mankind
was
his
swing
philanthropy
was
his
insurance
office
vehement
cheering
he
had
felt
some
pride
he
acknowledged
it
freely
and
let
his
enemies
make
the
most
of
it
he
had
felt
some
pride
when
he
presented
his
tittlebatian
theory
to
the
world
it
might
be
celebrated
or
it
might
not
a
cry
of
it
is
and
great
cheering
he
would
take
the
assertion
of
that
honourable
pickwickian
whose
voice
he
had
just
heard
it
was
celebrated
but
if
the
fame
of
that
treatise
were
to
extend
to
the
farthest
confines
of
the
known
world
the
pride
with
which
he
should
reflect
on
the
authorship
of
that
production
would
be
as
nothing
compared
with
the
pride
with
which
he
looked
around
him
on
this
the
proudest
moment
of
his
existence
cheers
he
was
a
humble
individual
no
still
he
could
not
but
feel
that
they
had
selected
him
for
a
service
of
great
honour
and
of
some
danger
travelling
was
in
a
troubled
state
and
the
minds
of
coachmen
were
unsettled
let
them
look
abroad
and
contemplate
the
scenes
which
were
enacting
around
them
were
upsetting
in
all
directions
horses
were
bolting
boats
were
overturning
and
boilers
were
bursting
cheers
a
voice
no
cheers
let
that
honourable
pickwickian
who
cried
no
so
loudly
come
forward
and
deny
it
if
he
could
cheers
who
was
it
that
cried
no
enthusiastic
cheering
was
it
some
vain
and
disappointed
man
he
would
not
say
haberdasher
loud
cheers
who
jealous
of
the
praise
which
had
been
perhaps
undeservedly
bestowed
on
his
pickwick
s
researches
and
smarting
under
the
censure
which
had
been
heaped
upon
his
own
feeble
attempts
at
rivalry
now
took
this
vile
and
calumnious
mode
of
mr
blotton
of
aldgate
rose
to
order
did
the
honourable
pickwickian
allude
to
him
cries
of
order
chair
yes
no
go
on
leave
off
etc
mr
pickwick
would
not
put
up
to
be
put
down
by
clamour
he
had
alluded
to
the
honourable
gentleman
great
excitement
mr
blotton
would
only
say
then
that
he
repelled
the
hon
s
false
and
scurrilous
accusation
with
profound
contempt
great
cheering
the
hon
gent
was
a
humbug
immense
confusion
and
loud
cries
of
chair
and
mr
snodgrass
rose
to
order
he
threw
himself
upon
the
chair
hear
he
wished
to
know
whether
this
disgraceful
contest
between
two
members
of
that
club
should
be
allowed
to
continue
hear
hear
the
chairman
was
quite
sure
the
hon
pickwickian
would
withdraw
the
expression
he
had
just
made
use
of
mr
blotton
with
all
possible
respect
for
the
chair
was
quite
sure
he
would
not
the
chairman
felt
it
his
imperative
duty
to
demand
of
the
honourable
gentleman
whether
he
had
used
the
expression
which
had
just
escaped
him
in
a
common
sense
mr
blotton
had
no
hesitation
in
saying
that
he
had
not
he
had
used
the
word
in
its
pickwickian
sense
hear
hear
he
was
bound
to
acknowledge
that
personally
he
entertained
the
highest
regard
and
esteem
for
the
honourable
gentleman
he
had
merely
considered
him
a
humbug
in
a
pickwickian
point
of
view
hear
hear
mr
pickwick
felt
much
gratified
by
the
fair
candid
and
full
explanation
of
his
honourable
friend
he
begged
it
to
be
at
once
understood
that
his
own
observations
had
been
merely
intended
to
bear
a
pickwickian
construction
cheers
here
the
entry
terminates
as
we
have
no
doubt
the
debate
did
also
after
arriving
at
such
a
highly
satisfactory
and
intelligible
point
we
have
no
official
statement
of
the
facts
which
the
reader
will
find
recorded
in
the
next
chapter
but
they
have
been
carefully
collated
from
letters
and
other
authorities
so
unquestionably
genuine
as
to
justify
their
narration
in
a
connected
form
chapter
ii
the
first
day
s
journey
and
the
first
evening
s
adventures
with
their
consequences
that
punctual
servant
of
all
work
the
sun
had
just
risen
and
begun
to
strike
a
light
on
the
morning
of
the
thirteenth
of
may
one
thousand
eight
hundred
and
when
samuel
pickwick
burst
like
another
sun
from
his
slumbers
threw
open
his
chamber
window
and
looked
out
upon
the
world
beneath
goswell
street
was
at
his
feet
goswell
street
was
on
his
right
hand
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
goswell
street
extended
on
his
left
and
the
opposite
side
of
goswell
street
was
over
the
way
such
thought
pickwick
are
the
narrow
views
of
those
philosophers
who
content
with
examining
the
things
that
lie
before
them
look
not
to
the
truths
which
are
hidden
beyond
as
well
might
i
be
content
to
gaze
on
goswell
street
for
ever
without
one
effort
to
penetrate
to
the
hidden
countries
which
on
every
side
surround
and
having
given
vent
to
this
beautiful
reflection
pickwick
proceeded
to
put
himself
into
his
clothes
and
his
clothes
into
his
portmanteau
great
men
are
seldom
over
scrupulous
in
the
arrangement
of
their
attire
the
operation
of
shaving
dressing
and
was
soon
performed
and
in
another
hour
pickwick
with
his
portmanteau
in
his
hand
his
telescope
in
his
greatcoat
pocket
and
his
in
his
waistcoat
ready
for
the
reception
of
any
discoveries
worthy
of
being
noted
down
had
arrived
at
the
in
martin
cab
said
pickwick
here
you
are
sir
shouted
a
strange
specimen
of
the
human
race
in
a
sackcloth
coat
and
apron
of
the
same
who
with
a
brass
label
and
number
round
his
neck
looked
as
if
he
were
catalogued
in
some
collection
of
rarities
this
was
the
waterman
here
you
are

now
then
fust
cab
and
the
first
cab
having
been
fetched
from
the
house
where
he
had
been
smoking
his
first
pipe
pickwick
and
his
portmanteau
were
thrown
into
the
vehicle
golden
cross
said
pickwick
only
a
bob
s
vorth
tommy
cried
the
driver
sulkily
for
the
information
of
his
friend
the
waterman
as
the
cab
drove
off
how
old
is
that
horse
my
friend
inquired
pickwick
rubbing
his
nose
with
the
shilling
he
had
reserved
for
the
fare
replied
the
driver
eyeing
him
askant
what
ejaculated
pickwick
laying
his
hand
upon
his
the
driver
reiterated
his
former
statement
pickwick
looked
very
hard
at
the
man
s
face
but
his
features
were
immovable
so
he
noted
down
the
fact
forthwith
and
how
long
do
you
keep
him
out
at
a
time
inquired
pickwick
searching
for
further
information
two
or
three
veeks
replied
the
man
weeks
said
pickwick
in
astonishment
and
out
came
the
again
he
lives
at
pentonwil
when
he
s
at
home
observed
the
driver
coolly
but
we
seldom
takes
him
home
on
account
of
his
on
account
of
his
weakness
reiterated
the
perplexed
pickwick
he
always
falls
down
when
he
s
took
out
o
the
cab
continued
the
driver
but
when
he
s
in
it
we
bears
him
up
werry
tight
and
takes
him
in
werry
short
so
as
he
can
t
werry
well
fall
down
and
we
ve
got
a
pair
o
precious
large
wheels
on
so
ven
he
does
move
they
run
after
him
and
he
must
go
on
he
can
t
help
pickwick
entered
every
word
of
this
statement
in
his
with
the
view
of
communicating
it
to
the
club
as
a
singular
instance
of
the
tenacity
of
life
in
horses
under
trying
circumstances
the
entry
was
scarcely
completed
when
they
reached
the
golden
cross
down
jumped
the
driver
and
out
got
pickwick
tupman
snodgrass
and
winkle
who
had
been
anxiously
waiting
the
arrival
of
their
illustrious
leader
crowded
to
welcome
him
here
s
your
fare
said
pickwick
holding
out
the
shilling
to
the
driver
what
was
the
learned
man
s
astonishment
when
that
unaccountable
person
flung
the
money
on
the
pavement
and
requested
in
figurative
terms
to
be
allowed
the
pleasure
of
fighting
him
pickwick
for
the
amount
you
are
mad
said
snodgrass
or
drunk
said
winkle
or
both
said
tupman
come
on
said
the
sparring
away
like
clockwork
come
on
all
four
on
here
s
a
lark
shouted
half
a
dozen
hackney
coachmen
go
to
vork
sam
and
they
crowded
with
great
glee
round
the
party
what
s
the
row
sam
inquired
one
gentleman
in
black
calico
sleeves
row
replied
the
cabman
what
did
he
want
my
number
for
i
didn
t
want
your
number
said
the
astonished
pickwick
what
did
you
take
it
for
then
inquired
the
cabman
i
didn
t
take
it
said
pickwick
indignantly
would
anybody
believe
continued
the
appealing
to
the
crowd
would
anybody
believe
as
an
informer
ud
go
about
in
a
man
s
cab
not
only
takin
down
his
number
but
ev
ry
word
he
says
into
the
bargain
a
light
flashed
upon
pickwick
it
was
the
did
he
though
inquired
another
cabman
yes
did
he
replied
the
first
and
then
arter
aggerawatin
me
to
assault
him
gets
three
witnesses
here
to
prove
it
but
i
ll
give
it
him
if
i
ve
six
months
for
it
come
on
and
the
cabman
dashed
his
hat
upon
the
ground
with
a
reckless
disregard
of
his
own
private
property
and
knocked
pickwick
s
spectacles
off
and
followed
up
the
attack
with
a
blow
on
pickwick
s
nose
and
another
on
pickwick
s
chest
and
a
third
in
snodgrass
s
eye
and
a
fourth
by
way
of
variety
in
tupman
s
waistcoat
and
then
danced
into
the
road
and
then
back
again
to
the
pavement
and
finally
dashed
the
whole
temporary
supply
of
breath
out
of
winkle
s
body
and
all
in
half
a
dozen
seconds
where
s
an
officer
said
snodgrass
put
em
under
the
pump
suggested
a
you
shall
smart
for
this
gasped
pickwick
informers
shouted
the
crowd
come
on
cried
the
cabman
who
had
been
sparring
without
cessation
the
whole
time
the
mob
hitherto
had
been
passive
spectators
of
the
scene
but
as
the
intelligence
of
the
pickwickians
being
informers
was
spread
among
them
they
began
to
canvass
with
considerable
vivacity
the
propriety
of
enforcing
the
heated
s
proposition
and
there
is
no
saying
what
acts
of
personal
aggression
they
might
have
committed
had
not
the
affray
been
unexpectedly
terminated
by
the
interposition
of
a
what
s
the
fun
said
a
rather
tall
thin
young
man
in
a
green
coat
emerging
suddenly
from
the
informers
shouted
the
crowd
again
we
are
not
roared
pickwick
in
a
tone
which
to
any
dispassionate
listener
carried
conviction
with
it
ain
t
you
though
ain
t
you
said
the
young
man
appealing
to
pickwick
and
making
his
way
through
the
crowd
by
the
infallible
process
of
elbowing
the
countenances
of
its
component
members
that
learned
man
in
a
few
hurried
words
explained
the
real
state
of
the
case
come
along
then
said
he
of
the
green
coat
lugging
pickwick
after
him
by
main
force
and
talking
the
whole
way
here
no
take
your
fare
and
take
yourself
off

put
that
in
his
pipe
like
the
flavour
damned
and
with
a
lengthened
string
of
similar
broken
sentences
delivered
with
extraordinary
volubility
the
stranger
led
the
way
to
the
traveller
s
whither
he
was
closely
followed
by
pickwick
and
his
disciples

odd
standing
in
the
open
street
half
an
hour
with
your
eye
against
a
eh
very
good
ha
ha
and
the
stranger
without
stopping
to
take
breath
swallowed
at
a
draught
full
half
a
pint
of
the
reeking
and
flung
himself
into
a
chair
with
as
much
ease
as
if
nothing
uncommon
had
occurred
while
his
three
companions
were
busily
engaged
in
proffering
their
thanks
to
their
new
acquaintance
pickwick
had
leisure
to
examine
his
costume
and
appearance
he
was
about
the
middle
height
but
the
thinness
of
his
body
and
the
length
of
his
legs
gave
him
the
appearance
of
being
much
taller
the
green
coat
had
been
a
smart
dress
garment
in
the
days
of
but
had
evidently
in
those
times
adorned
a
much
shorter
man
than
the
stranger
for
the
soiled
and
faded
sleeves
scarcely
reached
to
his
wrists
it
was
buttoned
closely
up
to
his
chin
at
the
imminent
hazard
of
splitting
the
back
and
an
old
stock
without
a
vestige
of
shirt
collar
ornamented
his
neck
his
scanty
black
trousers
displayed
here
and
there
those
shiny
patches
which
bespeak
long
service
and
were
strapped
very
tightly
over
a
pair
of
patched
and
mended
shoes
as
if
to
conceal
the
dirty
white
stockings
which
were
nevertheless
distinctly
visible
his
long
black
hair
escaped
in
negligent
waves
from
beneath
each
side
of
his
old
hat
and
glimpses
of
his
bare
wrists
might
be
observed
between
the
tops
of
his
gloves
and
the
cuffs
of
his
coat
sleeves
his
face
was
thin
and
haggard
but
an
indescribable
air
of
jaunty
impudence
and
perfect
pervaded
the
whole
man
such
was
the
individual
on
whom
pickwick
gazed
through
his
spectacles
which
he
had
fortunately
recovered
and
to
whom
he
proceeded
when
his
friends
had
exhausted
themselves
to
return
in
chosen
terms
his
warmest
thanks
for
his
recent
assistance
never
mind
said
the
stranger
cutting
the
address
very
short
said
enough
no
more
smart
chap
that
cabman
handled
his
fives
well
but
if
i
d
been
your
friend
in
the
green
jemmy
damn
me
punch
his
head
cod
i
would
pig
s
whisper
pieman
too
no
this
coherent
speech
was
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
the
rochester
coachman
to
announce
that
the
commodore
was
on
the
point
of
starting
commodore
said
the
stranger
starting
up
my
coach
place
booked
one

to
pay
for
the
want

for
a
five
bad
silver
brummagem

won
t
do
no

eh
and
he
shook
his
head
most
knowingly
now
it
so
happened
that
pickwick
and
his
three
companions
had
resolved
to
make
rochester
their
first
too
and
having
intimated
to
their
acquaintance
that
they
were
journeying
to
the
same
city
they
agreed
to
occupy
the
seat
at
the
back
of
the
coach
where
they
could
all
sit
together
up
with
you
said
the
stranger
assisting
pickwick
on
to
the
roof
with
so
much
precipitation
as
to
impair
the
gravity
of
that
gentleman
s
deportment
very
materially

inquired
the
coachman

in

with

of

by
way
of
parenthesis
when
the
coach
changed
horses
did
the
stranger
proceed
until
they
reached
rochester
bridge
by
which
time
the
both
of
pickwick
and
snodgrass
were
completely
filled
with
selections
from
his
adventures
magnificent

augustus
snodgrass
with
all
the
poetic
fervour
that
distinguished
him
when
they
came
in
sight
of
the
fine
old
castle
what
a
study
for
an
antiquarian
were
the
very
words
which
fell
from
pickwick
s
mouth
as
he
applied
his
telescope
to
his

the

continued
to

they

the

stopped

winkle
turned
to
pickwick
and
murmured
a
few
words
a
whisper
passed
from
pickwick
to
snodgrass
from
snodgrass
to
tupman
and
nods
of
assent
were
exchanged
pickwick
addressed
the
stranger
you
rendered
us
a
very
important
service
this
morning
sir
said
he
will
you
allow
us
to
offer
a
slight
mark
of
our
gratitude
by
begging
the
favour
of
your
company
at
dinner
great
pleasure
not
presume
to
dictate
but
broiled
fowl
and
thing
what
time
let
me
see
replied
pickwick
referring
to
his
watch
it
is
now
nearly
three
shall
we
say
five
suit
me
excellently
said
the
stranger
five
precisely
till
then
care
of
yourselves
and
lifting
the
hat
a
few
inches
from
his
head
and
carelessly
replacing
it
very
much
on
one
side
the
stranger
with
half
the
brown
paper
parcel
sticking
out
of
his
pocket
walked
briskly
up
the
yard
and
turned
into
the
high
street
evidently
a
traveller
in
many
countries
and
a
close
observer
of
men
and
things
said
pickwick
i
should
like
to
see
his
poem
said
snodgrass
i
should
like
to
have
seen
that
dog
said
winkle
tupman
said
nothing
but
he
thought
of
donna
christina
the
stomach
pump
and
the
fountain
and
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
a
private
having
been
engaged
bedrooms
inspected
and
dinner
ordered
the
party
walked
out
to
view
the
city
and
adjoining
neighbourhood
we
do
not
find
from
a
careful
perusal
of
pickwick
s
notes
of
the
four
towns
stroud
rochester
chatham
and
brompton
that
his
impressions
of
their
appearance
differ
in
any
material
point
from
those
of
other
travellers
who
have
gone
over
the
same
ground
his
general
description
is
easily
abridged
the
principal
productions
of
these
towns
says
pickwick
appear
to
be
soldiers
sailors
jews
chalk
shrimps
officers
and
dockyard
men
the
commodities
chiefly
exposed
for
sale
in
the
public
streets
are
marine
stores
apples
and
oysters
the
streets
present
a
lively
and
animated
appearance
occasioned
chiefly
by
the
conviviality
of
the
military
it
is
truly
delightful
to
a
philanthropic
mind
to
see
these
gallant
men
staggering
along
under
the
influence
of
an
overflow
both
of
animal
and
ardent
spirits
more
especially
when
we
remember
that
the
following
them
about
and
jesting
with
them
affords
a
cheap
and
innocent
amusement
for
the
boy
population
nothing
adds
pickwick
can
exceed
their
it
was
but
the
day
before
my
arrival
that
one
of
them
had
been
most
grossly
insulted
in
the
house
of
a
publican
the
barmaid
had
positively
refused
to
draw
him
any
more
liquor
in
return
for
which
he
had
merely
in
playfulness
drawn
his
bayonet
and
wounded
the
girl
in
the
shoulder
and
yet
this
fine
fellow
was
the
very
first
to
go
down
to
the
house
next
morning
and
express
his
readiness
to
overlook
the
matter
and
forget
what
had
occurred
the
consumption
of
tobacco
in
these
towns
continues
pickwick
must
be
very
great
and
the
smell
which
pervades
the
streets
must
be
exceedingly
delicious
to
those
who
are
extremely
fond
of
smoking
a
superficial
traveller
might
object
to
the
dirt
which
is
their
leading
characteristic
but
to
those
who
view
it
as
an
indication
of
traffic
and
commercial
prosperity
it
is
truly
punctual
to
five
o
clock
came
the
stranger
and
shortly
afterwards
the
dinner
he
had
divested
himself
of
his
brown
paper
parcel
but
had
made
no
alteration
in
his
attire
and
was
if
possible
more
loquacious
than
ever
what
s
that
he
inquired
as
the
waiter
removed
one
of
the
covers

with
pleasure
said
pickwick
and
the
stranger
took
wine
first
with
him
and
then
with
snodgrass
and
then
with
tupman
and
then
with
winkle
and
then
with
the
whole
party
together
almost
as
rapidly
as
he
talked
devil
of
a
mess
on
the
staircase

said
the
stranger

tupman
the

very
much
like
to

said
tupman
resuming
the
subject
of
the
ball
very
tickets
at
the
bar
sir
interposed
the
waiter
each
tupman
again
expressed
an
earnest
wish
to
be
present
at
the
festivity
but
meeting
with
no
response
in
the
darkened
eye
of
snodgrass
or
the
abstracted
gaze
of
pickwick
he
applied
himself
with
great
interest
to
the
port
wine
and
dessert
which
had
just
been
placed
on
the
table
the
waiter
withdrew
and
the
party
were
left
to
enjoy
the
cosy
couple
of
hours
succeeding
dinner
beg
your
pardon
sir
said
the
stranger
bottle
stands
pass
it
round
way
of
the
sun
through
the
no
heeltaps
and
he
emptied
his
glass
which
he
had
filled
about
two
minutes
before
and
poured
out
another
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
was
used
to
it
the
wine
was
passed
and
a
fresh
supply
ordered
the
visitor
talked
the
pickwickians
listened
tupman
felt
every
moment
more
disposed
for
the
ball
pickwick
s
countenance
glowed
with
an
expression
of
universal
philanthropy
and
winkle
and
snodgrass
fell
fast
asleep
they
re
beginning
upstairs
said
the
stranger
hear
the
company
fiddles
tuning
now
the
harp
there
they
the
various
sounds
which
found
their
way
downstairs
announced
the
commencement
of
the
first
quadrille
how
i
should
like
to
go
said
tupman
again
so
should
i
said
the
stranger
confounded
luggage
heavy
smacks
nothing
to
go
in
odd
ain
t
it
now
general
benevolence
was
one
of
the
leading
features
of
the
pickwickian
theory
and
no
one
was
more
remarkable
for
the
zealous
manner
in
which
he
observed
so
noble
a
principle
than
tracy
tupman
the
number
of
instances
recorded
on
the
transactions
of
the
society
in
which
that
excellent
man
referred
objects
of
charity
to
the
houses
of
other
members
for
garments
or
pecuniary
relief
is
almost
incredible
i
should
be
very
happy
to
lend
you
a
change
of
apparel
for
the
purpose
said
tracy
tupman
but
you
are
rather
slim
and
i
am
rather
fat

leaves

from
the
tub
and
adopted

not

ha
ha
pass
the
whether
tupman
was
somewhat
indignant
at
the
peremptory
tone
in
which
he
was
desired
to
pass
the
wine
which
the
stranger
passed
so
quickly
away
or
whether
he
felt
very
properly
scandalised
at
an
influential
member
of
the
pickwick
club
being
ignominiously
compared
to
a
dismounted
bacchus
is
a
fact
not
yet
completely
ascertained
he
passed
the
wine
coughed
twice
and
looked
at
the
stranger
for
several
seconds
with
a
stern
intensity
as
that
individual
however
appeared
perfectly
collected
and
quite
calm
under
his
searching
glance
he
gradually
relaxed
and
reverted
to
the
subject
of
the
ball
i
was
about
to
observe
sir
he
said
that
though
my
apparel
would
be
too
large
a
suit
of
my
friend
winkle
s
would
perhaps
fit
you
the
stranger
took
winkle
s
measure
with
his
eye
and
that
feature
glistened
with
satisfaction
as
he
said
just
the
tupman
looked
round
him
the
wine
which
had
exerted
its
somniferous
influence
over
snodgrass
and
winkle
had
stolen
upon
the
senses
of
pickwick
that
gentleman
had
gradually
passed
through
the
various
stages
which
precede
the
lethargy
produced
by
dinner
and
its
consequences
he
had
undergone
the
ordinary
transitions
from
the
height
of
conviviality
to
the
depth
of
misery
and
from
the
depth
of
misery
to
the
height
of
conviviality
like
a
in
the
street
with
the
wind
in
the
pipe
he
had
exhibited
for
a
moment
an
unnatural
brilliancy
then
sank
so
low
as
to
be
scarcely
discernible
after
a
short
interval
he
had
burst
out
again
to
enlighten
for
a
moment
then
flickered
with
an
uncertain
staggering
sort
of
light
and
then
gone
out
altogether
his
head
was
sunk
upon
his
bosom
and
perpetual
snoring
with
a
partial
choke
occasionally
were
the
only
audible
indications
of
the
great
man
s
presence
the
temptation
to
be
present
at
the
ball
and
to
form
his
first
impressions
of
the
beauty
of
the
kentish
ladies
was
strong
upon
tupman
the
temptation
to
take
the
stranger
with
him
was
equally
great
he
was
wholly
unacquainted
with
the
place
and
its
inhabitants
and
the
stranger
seemed
to
possess
as
great
a
knowledge
of
both
as
if
he
had
lived
there
from
his
infancy
winkle
was
asleep
and
tupman
had
had
sufficient
experience
in
such
matters
to
know
that
the
moment
he
awoke
he
would
in
the
ordinary
course
of
nature
roll
heavily
to
bed
he
was
undecided
fill
your
glass
and
pass
the
wine
said
the
indefatigable
visitor
tupman
did
as
he
was
requested
and
the
additional
stimulus
of
the
last
glass
settled
his
determination
winkle
s
bedroom
is
inside
mine
said
tupman
i
couldn
t
make
him
understand
what
i
wanted
if
i
woke
him
now
but
i
know
he
has
a
suit
in
a
carpet
bag
and
supposing
you
wore
it
to
the
ball
and
took
it
off
when
we
returned
i
could
replace
it
without
troubling
him
at
all
about
the
capital
said
the
stranger
famous
plan
damned
odd
situation
fourteen
coats
in
the
and
obliged
to
wear
another
man
s
very
good
notion
that
we
must
purchase
our
tickets
said
tupman
not
worth
while
splitting
a
guinea
said
the
stranger
toss
who
shall
pay
for
both
i
call
you
spin
first
time
woman
woman
bewitching
woman
and
down
came
the
sovereign
with
the
dragon
called
by
courtesy
a
woman
uppermost
tupman
rang
the
bell
purchased
the
tickets
and
ordered
chamber
candlesticks
in
another
quarter
of
an
hour
the
stranger
was
completely
arrayed
in
a
full
suit
of
nathaniel
winkle
s
it
s
a
new
coat
said
tupman
as
the
stranger
surveyed
himself
with
great
complacency
in
a
cheval
glass
the
first
that
s
been
made
with
our
club
button
and
he
called
his
companions
attention
to
the
large
gilt
button
which
displayed
a
bust
of
pickwick
in
the
centre
and
the
letters
p
on
either
side

said
the
stranger

set
out

p
what
does

stand
for

tupman

than

in

and
devoted

to

of

bespoke

upon

crossed
the

and
leaning
against

gazing
with
an
air
of
respectful
and
melancholy
admiration
on
the
fat
countenance
of
the
little
old
lady

looked
on

mute
astonishment

returned

master
of

ceremonies
a
little
introductory
pantomime
and
the
stranger
and
budger
took
their
places
in
a
quadrille
the
surprise
of
tupman
at
this
summary
proceeding
great
as
it
was
was
immeasurably
exceeded
by
the
astonishment
of
the
doctor
the

young
and
the
widow
was
flattered
the

attentions
were
unheeded
by

indignation
was
wholly
lost

imperturbable

what
introducing
his

could
he
believe
his
eyes
he
looked
again
and
was
under
the
painful
necessity
of
admitting
the
veracity
of
his
optics
budger
was
dancing
with
tracy
tupman
there
was
no
mistaking
the
fact
there
was
the
widow
before
him
bouncing
bodily
here
and
there
with
unwonted
vigour
and
tracy
tupman
hopping
about
with
a
face
expressive
of
the
most
intense
solemnity
dancing
as
a
good
many
people
do
as
if
a
quadrille
were
not
a
thing
to
be
laughed
at
but
a
severe
trial
to
the
feelings
which
it
requires
inflexible
resolution
to
encounter
silently
and
patiently
did
the
doctor
bear
all
this
and
all
the
handings
of
negus
and
watching
for
glasses
and
darting
for
biscuits
and
coquetting
that
ensued
but
a
few
seconds
after
the
stranger
had
disappeared
to
lead
budger
to
her
carriage
he
darted
swiftly
from
the
room
with
every
particle
of
his
indignation
effervescing
from
all
parts
of
his
countenance
in
a
perspiration
of
passion
the
stranger
was
returning
and
tupman
was
beside
him
he
spoke
in
a
low
tone
and
laughed
the
little
doctor
thirsted
for
his
life
he
was
exulting
he
had
triumphed
sir
said
the
doctor
in
an
awful
voice
producing
a
card
and
retiring
into
an
angle
of
the
passage
my
name

replied
the
unmoved
stranger
doctor
slammer
looked
unutterable
ferocity
as
he
fixed
his
hat
on
his
head
with
an
indignant
knock
and
the
stranger
and
tupman
ascended
to
the
bedroom
of
the
latter
to
restore
the
borrowed
plumage
to
the
unconscious
winkle
that
gentleman
was
fast
asleep
the
restoration
was
soon
made
the
stranger
was
extremely
jocose
and
tracy
tupman
being
quite
bewildered
with
wine
negus
lights
and
ladies
thought
the
whole
affair
was
an
exquisite
joke
his
new
friend
departed
and
after
experiencing
some
slight
difficulty
in
finding
the
orifice
in
his
nightcap
originally
intended
for
the
reception
of
his
head
and
finally
overturning
his
candlestick
in
his
struggles
to
put
it
on
tracy
tupman
managed
to
get
into
bed
by
a
series
of
complicated
evolutions
and
shortly
afterwards
sank
into
repose
seven
o
clock
had
hardly
ceased
striking
on
the
following
morning
when
pickwick
s
comprehensive
mind
was
aroused
from
the
state
of
unconsciousness
in
which
slumber
had
plunged
it
by
a
loud
knocking
at
his
chamber
door
who
s
there
said
pickwick
starting
up
in
bed
boots
what
do
you
want
please
sir
can
you
tell
me
which
gentleman
of
your
party

a
bright
blue
with

with

on
it
it
s
been
given
out

thought
pickwick
and
the
man
has
forgotten

it
belongs
winkle
he
called
out
next

but
two
on
the
right
thank
ee
sir
said
the
boots
and
away
he
went
what
s
the
matter
cried
tupman
as
a
loud
knocking
at
his
door
roused
him
from
his
oblivious
repose

replied

tupman
calling
into

a
faint
voice
from
within
the
you

some
one
at
the
door
and
having
exerted
himself
to
articulate
thus
much
tracy
tupman
turned
round
and
fell
fast
asleep
again

said
winkle
hastily
jumping
out
of

and
putting
on
a
few
articles
of
clothing
wanted
at
this
distance
from
town
who
on
earth
can
want
me
gentleman
in

sir
replied
the
boots
as
winkle
opened
the
door
and
confronted
him
gentleman
says
he
ll
not
detain
you
a
moment
sir
but
he
can
take
no
very
odd
said
winkle
i
ll
be
down
he
hurriedly
wrapped
himself
in
a
and
and
proceeded
downstairs
an
old
woman
and
a
couple
of
waiters
were
cleaning
the
and
an
officer
in
undress
uniform
was
looking
out
of
the
window
he
turned
round
as
winkle
entered
and
made
a
stiff
inclination
of
the
head
having
ordered
the
attendants
to
retire
and
closed
the
door
very
carefully
he
said
mr
winkle
i
presume
my
name
is
winkle
you
will
not
be
surprised
sir
when
i
inform
you
that
i
have
called
here
this
morning
on
behalf
of
my
friend
doctor
slammer
of
the
doctor
slammer
said
winkle
doctor
slammer
he
begged
me
to
express
his
opinion
that
your
conduct
of
last
evening
was
of
a
description
which
no
gentleman
could
endure
and
he
added
which
no
one
gentleman
would
pursue
towards
winkle
s
astonishment
was
too
real
and
too
evident
to
escape
the
observation
of
doctor
slammer
s
friend
he
therefore
proceeded
my
friend
doctor
slammer
requested
me
to
add
that
he
was
firmly
persuaded
you
were
intoxicated
during
a
portion
of
the
evening
and
possibly
unconscious
of
the
extent
of
the
insult
you
were
guilty
of
he
commissioned
me
to
say
that
should
this
be
pleaded
as
an
excuse
for
your
behaviour
he
will
consent
to
accept
a
written
apology
to
be
penned
by
you
from
my
a
written
apology
repeated
winkle
in
the
most
emphatic
tone
of
amazement
possible
of
course
you
know
the
alternative
replied
the
visitor
coolly
were
you
intrusted
with
this
message
to
me
by
name
inquired
winkle
whose
intellects
were
hopelessly
confused
by
this
extraordinary
conversation
i
was
not
present
myself
replied
the
visitor
and
in
consequence
of
your
firm
refusal
to
give
your
card
to
doctor
slammer
i
was
desired
by
that
gentleman
to
identify
the
wearer
of
a
very
uncommon
coat
a
bright
blue
with
a
gilt
button
displaying
a
bust
and
the
letters
p
winkle
actually
staggered
with
astonishment
as
he
heard
his
own
costume
thus
minutely
described
doctor
slammer
s
friend
proceeded
from
the
inquiries
i
made
at
the
bar
just
now
i
was
convinced
that
the
owner
of
the
coat
in
question
arrived
here
with
three
gentlemen
yesterday
afternoon
i
immediately
sent
up
to
the
gentleman
who
was
described
as
appearing
the
head
of
the
party
and
he
at
once
referred
me
to
if
the
principal
tower
of
rochester
castle
had
suddenly
walked
from
its
foundation
and
stationed
itself
opposite
the
window
winkle
s
surprise
would
have
been
as
nothing
compared
with
the
profound
astonishment
with
which
he
had
heard
this
address
his
first
impression
was
that
his
coat
had
been
stolen
will
you
allow
me
to
detain
you
one
moment
said
he
certainly
replied
the
unwelcome
visitor
winkle
ran
hastily
upstairs
and
with
a
trembling
hand
opened
the
bag
there
was
the
coat
in
its
usual
place
but
exhibiting
on
a
close
inspection
evident
tokens
of
having
been
worn
on
the
preceding
night
it
must
be
so
said
winkle
letting
the
coat
fall
from
his
hands
i
took
too
much
wine
after
dinner
and
have
a
very
vague
recollection
of
walking
about
the
streets
and
smoking
a
cigar
afterwards
the
fact
is
i
was
very
drunk
i
must
have
changed
my
coat
gone
somewhere
and
insulted
somebody
i
have
no
doubt
of
it
and
this
message
is
the
terrible
saying
which
winkle
retraced
his
steps
in
the
direction
of
the
with
the
gloomy
and
dreadful
resolve
of
accepting
the
challenge
of
the
warlike
doctor
slammer
and
abiding
by
the
worst
consequences
that
might
ensue
to
this
determination
winkle
was
urged
by
a
variety
of
considerations
the
first
of
which
was
his
reputation
with
the
club
he
had
always
been
looked
up
to
as
a
high
authority
on
all
matters
of
amusement
and
dexterity
whether
offensive
defensive
or
inoffensive
and
if
on
this
very
first
occasion
of
being
put
to
the
test
he
shrunk
back
from
the
trial
beneath
his
leader
s
eye
his
name
and
standing
were
lost
for
ever
besides
he
remembered
to
have
heard
it
frequently
surmised
by
the
uninitiated
in
such
matters
that
by
an
understood
arrangement
between
the
seconds
the
pistols
were
seldom
loaded
with
ball
and
furthermore
he
reflected
that
if
he
applied
to
snodgrass
to
act
as
his
second
and
depicted
the
danger
in
glowing
terms
that
gentleman
might
possibly
communicate
the
intelligence
to
pickwick
who
would
certainly
lose
no
time
in
transmitting
it
to
the
local
authorities
and
thus
prevent
the
killing
or
maiming
of
his
follower
such
were
his
thoughts
when
he
returned
to
the
and
intimated
his
intention
of
accepting
the
doctor
s
challenge
will
you
refer
me
to
a
friend
to
arrange
the
time
and
place
of
meeting
said
the
officer
quite
unnecessary
replied
winkle
name
them
to
me
and
i
can
procure
the
attendance
of
a
friend
shall
we
say
sunset
this
evening
inquired
the
officer
in
a
careless
tone
very
good
replied
winkle
thinking
in
his
heart
it
was
very
bad
you
know
fort
pitt
yes
i
saw
it
if
you
will
take
the
trouble
to
turn
into
the
field
which
borders
the
trench
take
the
to
the
left
when
you
arrive
at
an
angle
of
the
fortification
and
keep
straight
on
till
you
see
me
i
will
precede
you
to
a
secluded
place
where
the
affair
can
be
conducted
without
fear
of
fear
of
interruption
thought
winkle
nothing
more
to
arrange
i
think
said
the
officer
i
am
not
aware
of
anything
more
replied
winkle
and
the
officer
whistled
a
lively
air
as
he
strode
away
that
morning
s
breakfast
passed
heavily
off
tupman
was
not
in
a
condition
to
rise
after
the
unwonted
dissipation
of
the
previous
night
snodgrass
appeared
to
labour
under
a
poetical
depression
of
spirits
and
even
pickwick
evinced
an
unusual
attachment
to
silence
and
water
winkle
eagerly
watched
his
opportunity
it
was
not
long
wanting
snodgrass
proposed
a
visit
to
the
castle
and
as
winkle
was
the
only
other
member
of
the
party
disposed
to
walk
they
went
out
together
snodgrass
said
winkle
when
they
had
turned
out
of
the
public
snodgrass
my
dear
fellow
can
i
rely
upon
your
secrecy
as
he
said
this
he
most
devoutly
and
earnestly
hoped
he
could
not
you
can
replied
snodgrass
hear
me
swear
no
no
interrupted
winkle
terrified
at
the
idea
of
his
companion
s
unconsciously
pledging
himself
not
to
give
information
don
t
swear
don
t
swear
it
s
quite
snodgrass
dropped
the
hand
which
he
had
in
the
spirit
of
poesy
raised
towards
the
clouds
as
he
made
the
above
appeal
and
assumed
an
attitude
of
attention
i
want
your
assistance
my
dear
fellow
in
an
affair
of
honour
said
winkle
you
shall
have
it
replied
snodgrass
clasping
his
friend
s
hand
with
a
doctor
doctor
slammer
of
the
said
winkle
wishing
to
make
the
matter
appear
as
solemn
as
possible
an
affair
with
an
officer
seconded
by
another
officer
at
sunset
this
evening
in
a
lonely
field
beyond
fort
i
will
attend
you
said
snodgrass
he
was
astonished
but
by
no
means
dismayed
it
is
extraordinary
how
cool
any
party
but
the
principal
can
be
in
such
cases
winkle
had
forgotten
this
he
had
judged
of
his
friend
s
feelings
by
his
own
the
consequences
may
be
dreadful
said
winkle
i
hope
not
said
snodgrass
the
doctor
i
believe
is
a
very
good
shot
said
winkle
most
of
these
military
men
are
observed
snodgrass
calmly
but
so
are
you
ain
t
you
winkle
replied
in
the
affirmative
and
perceiving
that
he
had
not
alarmed
his
companion
sufficiently
changed
his
ground
snodgrass
he
said
in
a
voice
tremulous
with
emotion
if
i
fall
you
will
find
in
a
packet
which
i
shall
place
in
your
hands
a
note
for
my
for
my
this
attack
was
a
failure
also
snodgrass
was
affected
but
he
undertook
the
delivery
of
the
note
as
readily
as
if
he
had
been
a
twopenny
postman
if
i
fall
said
winkle
or
if
the
doctor
falls
you
my
dear
friend
will
be
tried
as
an
accessory
before
the
fact
shall
i
involve
my
friend
in
transportation
possibly
for
life
snodgrass
winced
a
little
at
this
but
his
heroism
was
invincible
in
the
cause
of
friendship
he
fervently
exclaimed
i
would
brave
all
how
winkle
cursed
his
companion
s
devoted
friendship
internally
as
they
walked
silently
along
side
by
side
for
some
minutes
each
immersed
in
his
own
meditations
the
morning
was
wearing
away
he
grew
desperate
snodgrass
he
said
stopping
suddenly
do
not
let
me
be
balked
in
this
matter
do
not
give
information
to
the
local
authorities
do
not
obtain
the
assistance
of
several
peace
officers
to
take
either
me
or
doctor
slammer
of
the
regiment
at
present
quartered
in
chatham
barracks
into
custody
and
thus
prevent
this
duel
i
say
do
snodgrass
seized
his
friend
s
hand
warmly
as
he
enthusiastically
replied
not
for
worlds
a
thrill
passed
over
winkle
s
frame
as
the
conviction
that
he
had
nothing
to
hope
from
his
friend
s
fears
and
that
he
was
destined
to
become
an
animated
target
rushed
forcibly
upon
him
the
state
of
the
case
having
been
formally
explained
to
snodgrass
and
a
case
of
satisfactory
pistols
with
the
satisfactory
accompaniments
of
powder
ball
and
caps
having
been
hired
from
a
manufacturer
in
rochester
the
two
friends
returned
to
their
inn
winkle
to
ruminate
on
the
approaching
struggle
and
snodgrass
to
arrange
the
weapons
of
war
and
put
them
into
proper
order
for
immediate
use
it
was
a
dull
and
heavy
evening
when
they
again
sallied
forth
on
their
awkward
errand
winkle
was
muffled
up
in
a
huge
cloak
to
escape
observation
and
snodgrass
bore
under
his
the
instruments
of
destruction
have
you
got
everything
said
winkle
in
an
agitated
tone
everything
replied
snodgrass
plenty
of
ammunition
in
case
the
shots
don
t
take
effect
there
s
a
quarter
of
a
pound
of
powder
in
the
case
and
i
have
got
two
newspapers
in
my
pocket
for
the
these
were
instances
of
friendship
for
which
any
man
might
reasonably
feel
most
grateful
the
presumption
is
that
the
gratitude
of
winkle
was
too
powerful
for
utterance
as
he
said
nothing
but
continued
to
walk
on
rather
slowly
we
are
in
excellent
time
said
snodgrass
as
they
climbed
the
fence
of
the
first
field
the
sun
is
just
going
winkle
looked
up
at
the
declining
orb
and
painfully
thought
of
the
probability
of
his
going
down
himself
before
long
there
s
the
officer
exclaimed
winkle
after
a
few
minutes
walking
where
said
snodgrass
there
the
gentleman
in
the
blue
snodgrass
looked
in
the
direction
indicated
by
the
forefinger
of
his
friend
and
observed
a
figure
muffled
up
as
he
had
described
the
officer
evinced
his
consciousness
of
their
presence
by
slightly
beckoning
with
his
hand
and
the
two
friends
followed
him
at
a
little
distance
as
he
walked
away
the
evening
grew
more
dull
every
moment
and
a
melancholy
wind
sounded
through
the
deserted
fields
like
a
distant
giant
whistling
for
his
the
sadness
of
the
scene
imparted
a
sombre
tinge
to
the
feelings
of
winkle
he
started
as
they
passed
the
angle
of
the
trench
it
looked
like
a
colossal
grave
the
officer
turned
suddenly
from
the
path
and
after
climbing
a
paling
and
scaling
a
hedge
entered
a
secluded
field
two
gentlemen
were
waiting
in
it
one
was
a
little
fat
man
with
black
hair
and
the
other
a
portly
personage
in
a
braided
surtout
was
sitting
with
perfect
equanimity
on
a
the
other
party
and
a
surgeon
i
suppose
said
snodgrass
take
a
drop
of
winkle
seized
the
wicker
bottle
which
his
friend
proffered
and
took
a
lengthened
pull
at
the
exhilarating
liquid
my
friend
sir
snodgrass
said
winkle
as
the
officer
approached
doctor
slammer
s
friend
bowed
and
produced
a
case
similar
to
that
which
snodgrass
carried
we
have
nothing
further
to
say
sir
i
think
he
coldly
remarked
as
he
opened
the
case
an
apology
has
been
resolutely
nothing
sir
said
snodgrass
who
began
to
feel
rather
uncomfortable
himself
will
you
step
forward
said
the
officer
certainly
replied
snodgrass
the
ground
was
measured
and
preliminaries
arranged
you
will
find
these
better
than
your
own
said
the
opposite
second
producing
his
pistols
you
saw
me
load
them
do
you
object
to
use
them
certainly
not
replied
snodgrass
the
offer
relieved
him
from
considerable
embarrassment
for
his
previous
notions
of
loading
a
pistol
were
rather
vague
and
undefined
we
may
place
our
men
then
i
think
observed
the
officer
with
as
much
indifference
as
if
the
principals
were
and
the
seconds
players
i
think
we
may
replied
snodgrass
who
would
have
assented
to
any
proposition
because
he
knew
nothing
about
the
matter
the
officer
crossed
to
doctor
slammer
and
snodgrass
went
up
to
winkle
it
s
all
ready
said
he
offering
the
pistol
give
me
your
you
have
got
the
packet
my
dear
fellow
said
poor
winkle
all
right
said
snodgrass
be
steady
and
wing
it
occurred
to
winkle
that
this
advice
was
very
like
that
which
bystanders
invariably
give
to
the
smallest
boy
in
a
street
fight
namely
go
in
and
win
an
admirable
thing
to
recommend
if
you
only
know
how
to
do
it
he
took
off
his
cloak
however
in
silence
it
always
took
a
long
time
to
undo
that
cloak
and
accepted
the
pistol
the
seconds
retired
the
gentleman
on
the
did
the
same
and
the
belligerents
approached
each
other
winkle
was
always
remarkable
for
extreme
humanity
it
is
conjectured
that
his
unwillingness
to
hurt
a
intentionally
was
the
cause
of
his
shutting
his
eyes
when
he
arrived
at
the
fatal
spot
and
that
the
circumstance
of
his
eyes
being
closed
prevented
his
observing
the
very
extraordinary
and
unaccountable
demeanour
of
doctor
slammer
that
gentleman
started
stared
retreated
rubbed
his
eyes
stared
again
and
finally
shouted
stop
stop
what
s
all
this
said
doctor
slammer
as
his
friend
and
snodgrass
came
running
up
that
s
not
the
not
the
man
said
doctor
slammer
s
second
not
the
man
said
snodgrass
not
the
man
said
the
gentleman
with
the
in
his
hand
certainly
not
replied
the
little
doctor
that
s
not
the
person
who
insulted
me
last
very
extraordinary
exclaimed
the
officer
very
said
the
gentleman
with
the
the
only
question
is
whether
the
gentleman
being
on
the
ground
must
not
be
considered
as
a
matter
of
form
to
be
the
individual
who
insulted
our
friend
doctor
slammer
yesterday
evening
whether
he
is
really
that
individual
or
not
and
having
delivered
this
suggestion
with
a
very
sage
and
mysterious
air
the
man
with
the
took
a
large
pinch
of
snuff
and
looked
profoundly
round
with
the
air
of
an
authority
in
such
matters
now
winkle
had
opened
his
eyes
and
his
ears
too
when
he
heard
his
adversary
call
out
for
a
cessation
of
hostilities
and
perceiving
by
what
he
had
afterwards
said
that
there
was
beyond
all
question
some
mistake
in
the
matter
he
at
once
foresaw
the
increase
of
reputation
he
should
inevitably
acquire
by
concealing
the
real
motive
of
his
coming
out
he
therefore
stepped
boldly
forward
and
said
i
am
not
the
person
i
know
then
that
said
the
man
with
the
is
an
affront
to
doctor
slammer
and
a
sufficient
reason
for
proceeding
pray
be
quiet
payne
said
the
doctor
s
second
why
did
you
not
communicate
this
fact
to
me
this
morning
sir
to
be
sure
to
be
sure
said
the
man
with
the
indignantly
i
entreat
you
to
be
quiet
payne
said
the
other
may
i
repeat
my
question
sir
because
sir
replied
winkle
who
had
had
time
to
deliberate
upon
his
answer
because
sir
you
described
an
intoxicated
and
ungentlemanly
person
as
wearing
a
coat
which
i
have
the
honour
not
only
to
wear
but
to
have
invented
the
proposed
uniform
sir
of
the
pickwick
club
in
london
the
honour
of
that
uniform
i
feel
bound
to
maintain
and
i
therefore
without
inquiry
accepted
the
challenge
which
you
offered
my
dear
sir
said
the
little
doctor
advancing
with
extended
hand
i
honour
your
gallantry
permit
me
to
say
sir
that
i
highly
admire
your
conduct
and
extremely
regret
having
caused
you
the
inconvenience
of
this
meeting
to
no
i
beg
you
won
t
mention
it
sir
said
winkle
i
shall
feel
proud
of
your
acquaintance
sir
said
the
little
doctor
it
will
afford
me
the
greatest
pleasure
to
know
you
sir
replied
winkle
thereupon
the
doctor
and
winkle
shook
hands
and
then
winkle
and
lieutenant
tappleton
the
doctor
s
second
and
then
winkle
and
the
man
with
the
and
finally
winkle
and
snodgrass
the
gentleman
in
an
excess
of
admiration
at
the
noble
conduct
of
his
heroic
friend
i
think
we
may
adjourn
said
lieutenant
tappleton
certainly
added
the
doctor
unless
interposed
the
man
with
the
unless
winkle
feels
himself
aggrieved
by
the
challenge
in
which
case
i
submit
he
has
a
right
to
winkle
with
great
expressed
himself
quite
satisfied
already
or
possibly
said
the
man
with
the
the
gentleman
s
second
may
feel
himself
affronted
with
some
observations
which
fell
from
me
at
an
early
period
of
this
meeting
if
so
i
shall
be
happy
to
give
him
satisfaction
snodgrass
hastily
professed
himself
very
much
obliged
with
the
handsome
offer
of
the
gentleman
who
had
spoken
last
which
he
was
only
induced
to
decline
by
his
entire
contentment
with
the
whole
proceedings
the
two
seconds
adjusted
the
cases
and
the
whole
party
left
the
ground
in
a
much
more
lively
manner
than
they
had
proceeded
to
it
do
you
remain
long
here
inquired
doctor
slammer
of
winkle
as
they
walked
on
most
amicably
together
i
think
we
shall
leave
here
the
day
after
was
the
reply
i
trust
i
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
and
your
friend
at
my
rooms
and
of
spending
a
pleasant
evening
with
you
after
this
awkward
mistake
said
the
little
doctor
are
you
disengaged
this
evening
we
have
some
friends
here
replied
winkle
and
i
should
not
like
to
leave
them
perhaps
you
and
your
friend
will
join
us
at
the
with
great
pleasure
said
the
little
doctor
will
ten
o
clock
be
too
late
to
look
in
for
half
an
hour
oh
dear
no
said
winkle
i
shall
be
most
happy
to
introduce
you
to
my
friends
pickwick
and
it
will
give
me
great
pleasure
i
am
sure
replied
doctor
slammer
little
suspecting
who
tupman
was
you
will
be
sure
to
come
said
snodgrass
oh
by
this
time
they
had
reached
the
road
cordial
farewells
were
exchanged
and
the
party
separated
doctor
slammer
and
his
friends
repaired
to
the
barracks
and
winkle
accompanied
by
snodgrass
returned
to
their
inn
chapter
iii
a
new
acquaintance
the
stroller
s
tale
a
disagreeable
interruption
and
an
unpleasant
encounter
pickwick
had
felt
some
apprehensions
in
consequence
of
the
unusual
absence
of
his
two
friends
which
their
mysterious
behaviour
during
the
whole
morning
had
by
no
means
tended
to
diminish
it
was
therefore
with
more
than
ordinary
pleasure
that
he
rose
to
greet
them
when
they
again
entered
and
with
more
than
ordinary
interest
that
he
inquired
what
had
occurred
to
detain
them
from
his
society
in
reply
to
his
questions
on
this
point
snodgrass
was
about
to
offer
an
historical
account
of
the
circumstances
just
now
detailed
when
he
was
suddenly
checked
by
observing
that
there
were
present
not
only
tupman
and
their
companion
of
the
preceding
day
but
another
stranger
of
equally
singular
appearance
it
was
a
man
whose
sallow
face
and
eyes
were
rendered
still
more
striking
than
nature
had
made
them
by
the
straight
black
hair
which
hung
in
matted
disorder
down
his
face
his
eyes
were
almost
unnaturally
bright
and
piercing
his
were
high
and
prominent
and
his
jaws
were
so
long
and
lank
that
an
observer
would
have
supposed
that
he
was
drawing
the
flesh
of
his
face
in
for
a
moment
by
some
contraction
of
the
muscles
if
his
mouth
and
immovable
expression
had
not
announced
that
it
was
his
ordinary
appearance
round
his
neck
he
wore
a
green
shawl
with
the
large
ends
straggling
over
his
chest
and
making
their
appearance
occasionally
beneath
the
worn
of
his
old
waistcoat
his
upper
garment
was
a
long
black
surtout
and
below
it
he
wore
wide
drab
trousers
and
large
boots
running
rapidly
to
seed
it
was
on
this
person
that
winkle
s
eye
rested
and
it
was
towards
him
that
pickwick
extended
his
hand
when
he
said
a
friend
of
our
friend
s
here
we
discovered
this
morning
that
our
friend
was
connected
with
the
theatre
in
this
place
though
he
is
not
desirous
to
have
it
generally
known
and
this
gentleman
is
a
member
of
the
same
profession
he
was
about
to
favour
us
with
a
little
anecdote
connected
with
it
when
you
lots
of
anecdote
said
the
stranger
of
the
day
before
advancing
to
winkle
and
speaking
in
a
low
and
confidential
tone
rum
fellow
does
the
heavy
business
no
actor
strange
man
all
sorts
of
miseries
dismal
jemmy
we
call
him
on
the
winkle
and
snodgrass
politely
welcomed
the
gentleman
elegantly
designated
as
dismal
jemmy
and
calling
for
in
imitation
of
the
remainder
of
the
company
seated
themselves
at
the
table
now
sir
said
pickwick
will
you
oblige
us
by
proceeding
with
what
you
were
going
to
relate
the
dismal
individual
took
a
dirty
roll
of
paper
from
his
pocket
and
turning
to
snodgrass
who
had
just
taken
out
his
said
in
a
hollow
voice
perfectly
in
keeping
with
his
outward
man
are
you
the
poet
i
i
do
a
little
in
that
way
replied
snodgrass
rather
taken
aback
by
the
abruptness
of
the
question
ah
poetry
makes
life
what
light
and
music
do
the
stage
strip
the
one
of
the
false
embellishments
and
the
other
of
its
illusions
and
what
is
there
real
in
either
to
live
or
care
for
very
true
sir
replied
snodgrass
to
be
before
the
footlights
continued
the
dismal
man
is
like
sitting
at
a
grand
court
show
and
admiring
the
silken
dresses
of
the
gaudy
throng
to
be
behind
them
is
to
be
the
people
who
make
that
finery
uncared
for
and
unknown
and
left
to
sink
or
swim
to
starve
or
live
as
fortune
wills
certainly
said
snodgrass
for
the
sunken
eye
of
the
dismal
man
rested
on
him
and
he
felt
it
necessary
to
say
something
go
on
jemmy
said
the
spanish
traveller
like
susan
all
in
the
downs
no
croaking
speak
out
look
will
you
make
another
glass
before
you
begin
sir
said
pickwick
the
dismal
man
took
the
hint
and
having
mixed
a
glass
of
water
and
slowly
swallowed
half
of
it
opened
the
roll
of
paper
and
proceeded
partly
to
read
and
partly
to
relate
the
following
incident
which
we
find
recorded
on
the
transactions
of
the
club
as
the
stroller
s
the
stroller
s
tale
there
is
nothing
of
the
marvellous
in
what
i
am
going
to
relate
said
the
dismal
man
there
is
nothing
even
uncommon
in
it
want
and
sickness
are
too
common
in
many
stations
of
life
to
deserve
more
notice
than
is
usually
bestowed
on
the
most
ordinary
vicissitudes
of
human
nature
i
have
thrown
these
few
notes
together
because
the
subject
of
them
was
well
known
to
me
for
many
years
i
traced
his
progress
downwards
step
by
step
until
at
last
he
reached
that
excess
of
destitution
from
which
he
never
rose
again
the
man
of
whom
i
speak
was
a
low
pantomime
actor
and
like
many
people
of
his
class
an
habitual
drunkard
in
his
better
days
before
he
had
become
enfeebled
by
dissipation
and
emaciated
by
disease
he
had
been
in
the
receipt
of
a
good
salary
which
if
he
had
been
careful
and
prudent
he
might
have
continued
to
receive
for
some
years
not
many
because
these
men
either
die
early
or
by
unnaturally
taxing
their
bodily
energies
lose
prematurely
those
physical
powers
on
which
alone
they
can
depend
for
subsistence
his
besetting
sin
gained
so
fast
upon
him
however
that
it
was
found
impossible
to
employ
him
in
the
situations
in
which
he
really
was
useful
to
the
theatre
the
house
had
a
fascination
for
him
which
he
could
not
resist
neglected
disease
and
hopeless
poverty
were
as
certain
to
be
his
portion
as
death
itself
if
he
persevered
in
the
same
course
yet
he
did
persevere
and
the
result
may
be
guessed
he
could
obtain
no
engagement
and
he
wanted
bread
everybody
who
is
at
all
acquainted
with
theatrical
matters
knows
what
a
host
of
shabby
men
hang
about
the
stage
of
a
large
establishment
not
regularly
engaged
actors
but
ballet
people
procession
men
tumblers
and
so
forth
who
are
taken
on
during
the
run
of
a
pantomime
or
an
easter
piece
and
are
then
discharged
until
the
production
of
some
heavy
spectacle
occasions
a
new
demand
for
their
services
to
this
mode
of
life
the
man
was
compelled
to
resort
and
taking
the
chair
every
night
at
some
low
theatrical
house
at
once
put
him
in
possession
of
a
few
more
shillings
weekly
and
enabled
him
to
gratify
his
old
propensity
even
this
resource
shortly
failed
him
his
irregularities
were
too
great
to
admit
of
his
earning
the
wretched
pittance
he
might
thus
have
procured
and
he
was
actually
reduced
to
a
state
bordering
on
starvation
only
procuring
a
trifle
occasionally
by
borrowing
it
of
some
old
companion
or
by
obtaining
an
appearance
at
one
or
other
of
the
commonest
of
the
minor
theatres
and
when
he
did
earn
anything
it
was
spent
in
the
old
way
about
this
time
and
when
he
had
been
existing
for
upwards
of
a
year
no
one
knew
how
i
had
a
short
engagement
at
one
of
the
theatres
on
the
surrey
side
of
the
water
and
here
i
saw
this
man
whom
i
had
lost
sight
of
for
some
time
for
i
had
been
travelling
in
the
provinces
and
he
had
been
skulking
in
the
lanes
and
alleys
of
london
i
was
dressed
to
leave
the
house
and
was
crossing
the
stage
on
my
way
out
when
he
tapped
me
on
the
shoulder
never
shall
i
forget
the
repulsive
sight
that
met
my
eye
when
i
turned
round
he
was
dressed
for
the
pantomimes
in
all
the
absurdity
of
a
clown
s
costume
the
spectral
figures
in
the
dance
of
death
the
most
frightful
shapes
that
the
ablest
painter
ever
portrayed
on
canvas
never
presented
an
appearance
half
so
ghastly
his
bloated
body
and
shrunken
legs
their
deformity
enhanced
a
hundredfold
by
the
fantastic
dress
the
glassy
eyes
contrasting
fearfully
with
the
thick
white
paint
with
which
the
face
was
besmeared
the
ornamented
head
trembling
with
paralysis
and
the
long
skinny
hands
rubbed
with
white
chalk
all
gave
him
a
hideous
and
unnatural
appearance
of
which
no
description
could
convey
an
adequate
idea
and
which
to
this
day
i
shudder
to
think
of
his
voice
was
hollow
and
tremulous
as
he
took
me
aside
and
in
broken
words
recounted
a
long
catalogue
of
sickness
and
privations
terminating
as
usual
with
an
urgent
request
for
the
loan
of
a
trifling
sum
of
money
i
put
a
few
shillings
in
his
hand
and
as
i
turned
away
i
heard
the
roar
of
laughter
which
followed
his
first
tumble
on
the
stage
a
few
nights
afterwards
a
boy
put
a
dirty
scrap
of
paper
in
my
hand
on
which
were
scrawled
a
few
words
in
pencil
intimating
that
the
man
was
dangerously
ill
and
begging
me
after
the
performance
to
see
him
at
his
lodgings
in
some
street
i
forget
the
name
of
it
now
at
no
great
distance
from
the
theatre
i
promised
to
comply
as
soon
as
i
could
get
away
and
after
the
curtain
fell
sallied
forth
on
my
melancholy
errand
it
was
late
for
i
had
been
playing
in
the
last
piece
and
as
it
was
a
benefit
night
the
performances
had
been
protracted
to
an
unusual
length
it
was
a
dark
cold
night
with
a
chill
damp
wind
which
blew
the
rain
heavily
against
the
windows
and
pools
of
water
had
collected
in
the
narrow
and
streets
and
as
many
of
the
had
been
blown
out
by
the
violence
of
the
wind
the
walk
was
not
only
a
comfortless
but
most
uncertain
one
i
had
fortunately
taken
the
right
course
however
and
succeeded
after
a
little
difficulty
in
finding
the
house
to
which
i
had
been
directed
a
with
one
storey
above
it
in
the
back
room
of
which
lay
the
object
of
my
search
a
woman
the
man
s
wife
met
me
on
the
stairs
and
telling
me
that
he
had
just
fallen
into
a
kind
of
doze
led
me
softly
in
and
placed
a
chair
for
me
at
the
bedside
the
sick
man
was
lying
with
his
face
turned
towards
the
wall
and
as
he
took
no
heed
of
my
presence
i
had
leisure
to
observe
the
place
in
which
i
found
myself
he
was
lying
on
an
old
bedstead
which
turned
up
during
the
day
the
tattered
remains
of
a
checked
curtain
were
drawn
round
the
bed
s
head
to
exclude
the
wind
which
however
made
its
way
into
the
comfortless
room
through
the
numerous
chinks
in
the
door
and
blew
it
to
and
fro
every
instant
there
was
a
low
cinder
fire
in
a
rusty
unfixed
grate
and
an
old
stained
table
with
some
medicine
bottles
a
broken
glass
and
a
few
other
domestic
articles
was
drawn
out
before
it
a
little
child
was
sleeping
on
a
temporary
bed
which
had
been
made
for
it
on
the
floor
and
the
woman
sat
on
a
chair
by
its
side
there
were
a
couple
of
shelves
with
a
few
plates
and
cups
and
saucers
and
a
pair
of
stage
shoes
and
a
couple
of
foils
hung
beneath
them
with
the
exception
of
little
heaps
of
rags
and
bundles
which
had
been
carelessly
thrown
into
the
corners
of
the
room
these
were
the
only
things
in
the
apartment
i
had
had
time
to
note
these
little
particulars
and
to
mark
the
heavy
breathing
and
feverish
startings
of
the
sick
man
before
he
was
aware
of
my
presence
in
the
restless
attempts
to
procure
some
easy
for
his
head
he
tossed
his
hand
out
of
the
bed
and
it
fell
on
mine
he
started
up
and
stared
eagerly
in
my
face
mr
hutley
john
said
his
wife
mr
hutley
that
you
sent
for
night
you
ah
said
the
invalid
passing
his
hand
across
his
forehead
hutley
hutley
let
me
he
seemed
endeavouring
to
collect
his
thoughts
for
a
few
seconds
and
then
grasping
me
tightly
by
the
wrist
said
don
t
leave
me
don
t
leave
me
old
fellow
she
ll
murder
me
i
know
she
has
he
been
long
so
said
i
addressing
his
weeping
wife
since
yesterday
night
she
replied
john
john
don
t
you
know
me
don
t
let
her
come
near
me
said
the
man
with
a
shudder
as
she
stooped
over
him
drive
her
away
i
can
t
bear
her
near
he
stared
wildly
at
her
with
a
look
of
deadly
apprehension
and
then
whispered
in
my
ear
i
beat
her
jem
i
beat
her
yesterday
and
many
times
before
i
have
starved
her
and
the
boy
too
and
now
i
am
weak
and
helpless
jem
she
ll
murder
me
for
it
i
know
she
will
if
you
d
seen
her
cry
as
i
have
you
d
know
it
too
keep
her
he
relaxed
his
grasp
and
sank
back
exhausted
on
the
pillow
i
knew
but
too
well
what
all
this
meant
if
i
could
have
entertained
any
doubt
of
it
for
an
instant
one
glance
at
the
woman
s
pale
face
and
wasted
form
would
have
sufficiently
explained
the
real
state
of
the
case
you
had
better
stand
aside
said
i
to
the
poor
creature
you
can
do
him
no
good
perhaps
he
will
be
calmer
if
he
does
not
see
she
retired
out
of
the
man
s
sight
he
opened
his
eyes
after
a
few
seconds
and
looked
anxiously
round
is
she
gone
he
eagerly
inquired
yes
yes
said
i
she
shall
not
hurt
i
ll
tell
you
what
jem
said
the
man
in
a
low
voice
she
does
hurt
me
there
s
something
in
her
eyes
wakes
such
a
dreadful
fear
in
my
heart
that
it
drives
me
mad
all
last
night
her
large
staring
eyes
and
pale
face
were
close
to
mine
wherever
i
turned
they
turned
and
whenever
i
started
up
from
my
sleep
she
was
at
the
bedside
looking
at
he
drew
me
closer
to
him
as
he
said
in
a
deep
alarmed
whisper
jem
she
must
be
an
evil
spirit
a
devil
hush
i
know
she
is
if
she
had
been
a
woman
she
would
have
died
long
ago
no
woman
could
have
borne
what
she
i
sickened
at
the
thought
of
the
long
course
of
cruelty
and
neglect
which
must
have
occurred
to
produce
such
an
impression
on
such
a
man
i
could
say
nothing
in
reply
for
who
could
offer
hope
or
consolation
to
the
abject
being
before
me
i
sat
there
for
upwards
of
two
hours
during
which
time
he
tossed
about
murmuring
exclamations
of
pain
or
impatience
restlessly
throwing
his
arms
here
and
there
and
turning
constantly
from
side
to
side
at
length
he
fell
into
that
state
of
partial
unconsciousness
in
which
the
mind
wanders
uneasily
from
scene
to
scene
and
from
place
to
place
without
the
control
of
reason
but
still
without
being
able
to
divest
itself
of
an
indescribable
sense
of
present
suffering
finding
from
his
incoherent
wanderings
that
this
was
the
case
and
knowing
that
in
all
probability
the
fever
would
not
grow
immediately
worse
i
left
him
promising
his
miserable
wife
that
i
would
repeat
my
visit
next
evening
and
if
necessary
sit
up
with
the
patient
during
the
night
i
kept
my
promise
the
last
hours
had
produced
a
frightful
alteration
the
eyes
though
deeply
sunk
and
heavy
shone
with
a
lustre
frightful
to
behold
the
lips
were
parched
and
cracked
in
many
places
the
hard
dry
skin
glowed
with
a
burning
heat
and
there
was
an
almost
unearthly
air
of
wild
anxiety
in
the
man
s
face
indicating
even
more
strongly
the
ravages
of
the
disease
the
fever
was
at
its
height
i
took
the
seat
i
had
occupied
the
night
before
and
there
i
sat
for
hours
listening
to
sounds
which
must
strike
deep
to
the
heart
of
the
most
callous
among
human
beings
the
awful
ravings
of
a
dying
man
from
what
i
had
heard
of
the
medical
attendant
s
opinion
i
knew
there
was
no
hope
for
him
i
was
sitting
by
his
i
saw
the
wasted
limbs
which
a
few
hours
before
had
been
distorted
for
the
amusement
of
a
boisterous
gallery
writhing
under
the
tortures
of
a
burning
fever
i
heard
the
clown
s
shrill
laugh
blending
with
the
low
murmurings
of
the
dying
man
it
is
a
touching
thing
to
hear
the
mind
reverting
to
the
ordinary
occupations
and
pursuits
of
health
when
the
body
lies
before
you
weak
and
helpless
but
when
those
occupations
are
of
a
character
the
most
strongly
opposed
to
anything
we
associate
with
grave
and
solemn
ideas
the
impression
produced
is
infinitely
more
powerful
the
theatre
and
the
were
the
chief
themes
of
the
wretched
man
s
wanderings
it
was
evening
he
fancied
he
had
a
part
to
play
that
night
it
was
late
and
he
must
leave
home
instantly
why
did
they
hold
him
and
prevent
his
going
he
should
lose
the
money
he
must
go
no
they
would
not
let
him
he
hid
his
face
in
his
burning
hands
and
feebly
bemoaned
his
own
weakness
and
the
cruelty
of
his
persecutors
a
short
pause
and
he
shouted
out
a
few
doggerel
rhymes
the
last
he
had
ever
learned
he
rose
in
bed
drew
up
his
withered
limbs
and
rolled
about
in
uncouth
positions
he
was
acting
he
was
at
the
theatre
a
minute
s
silence
and
he
murmured
the
burden
of
some
roaring
song
he
had
reached
the
old
house
at
last
how
hot
the
room
was
he
had
been
ill
very
ill
but
he
was
well
now
and
happy
fill
up
his
glass
who
was
that
that
dashed
it
from
his
lips
it
was
the
same
persecutor
that
had
followed
him
before
he
fell
back
upon
his
pillow
and
moaned
aloud
a
short
period
of
oblivion
and
he
was
wandering
through
a
tedious
maze
of
rooms
so
low
sometimes
that
he
must
creep
upon
his
hands
and
knees
to
make
his
way
along
it
was
close
and
dark
and
every
way
he
turned
some
obstacle
impeded
his
progress
there
were
insects
too
hideous
crawling
things
with
eyes
that
stared
upon
him
and
filled
the
very
air
around
glistening
horribly
amidst
the
thick
darkness
of
the
place
the
walls
and
ceiling
were
alive
with
reptiles
the
vault
expanded
to
an
enormous
size
frightful
figures
flitted
to
and
fro
and
the
faces
of
men
he
knew
rendered
hideous
by
gibing
and
mouthing
peered
out
from
among
them
they
were
searing
him
with
heated
irons
and
binding
his
head
with
cords
till
the
blood
started
and
he
struggled
madly
for
life
at
the
close
of
one
of
these
paroxysms
when
i
had
with
great
difficulty
held
him
down
in
his
bed
he
sank
into
what
appeared
to
be
a
slumber
overpowered
with
watching
and
exertion
i
had
closed
my
eyes
for
a
few
minutes
when
i
felt
a
violent
clutch
on
my
shoulder
i
awoke
instantly
he
had
raised
himself
up
so
as
to
seat
himself
in
bed
a
dreadful
change
had
come
over
his
face
but
consciousness
had
returned
for
he
evidently
knew
me
the
child
who
had
been
long
since
disturbed
by
his
ravings
rose
from
its
little
bed
and
ran
towards
its
father
screaming
with
fright
the
mother
hastily
caught
it
in
her
arms
lest
he
should
injure
it
in
the
violence
of
his
insanity
but
terrified
by
the
alteration
of
his
features
stood
transfixed
by
the
bedside
he
grasped
my
shoulder
convulsively
and
striking
his
breast
with
the
other
hand
made
a
desperate
attempt
to
articulate
it
was
unavailing
he
extended
his
arm
towards
them
and
made
another
violent
effort
there
was
a
rattling
noise
in
the
throat
a
glare
of
the
eye
a
short
stifled
he
fell
back
dead
it
would
afford
us
the
highest
gratification
to
be
enabled
to
record
pickwick
s
opinion
of
the
foregoing
anecdote
we
have
little
doubt
that
we
should
have
been
enabled
to
present
it
to
our
readers
but
for
a
most
unfortunate
occurrence
pickwick
had
replaced
on
the
table
the
glass
which
during
the
last
few
sentences
of
the
tale
he
had
retained
in
his
hand
and
had
just
made
up
his
mind
to
speak
indeed
we
have
the
authority
of
snodgrass
s
for
stating
that
he
had
actually
opened
his
mouth
when
the
waiter
entered
the
room
and
said
some
gentlemen
it
has
been
conjectured
that
pickwick
was
on
the
point
of
delivering
some
remarks
which
would
have
enlightened
the
world
if
not
the
thames
when
he
was
thus
interrupted
for
he
gazed
sternly
on
the
waiter
s
countenance
and
then
looked
round
on
the
company
generally
as
if
seeking
for
information
relative
to
the
oh
said
winkle
rising
some
friends
of
mine
show
them
in
very
pleasant
fellows
added
winkle
after
the
waiter
had
retired
officers
of
the
whose
acquaintance
i
made
rather
oddly
this
morning
you
will
like
them
very
pickwick
s
equanimity
was
at
once
restored
the
waiter
returned
and
ushered
three
gentlemen
into
the
room
lieutenant
tappleton
said
winkle
lieutenant
tappleton
pickwick
doctor
payne
pickwick
snodgrass
you
have
seen
before
my
friend
tupman
doctor
payne
doctor
slammer
pickwick
tupman
doctor
slam
here
winkle
suddenly
paused
for
strong
emotion
was
visible
on
the
countenance
both
of
tupman
and
the
doctor
i
have
met
gentleman
before
said
the
doctor
with
marked
emphasis
indeed
said
winkle
and
and
that
person
too
if
i
am
not
mistaken
said
the
doctor
bestowing
a
scrutinising
glance
on
the
stranger
i
think
i
gave
that
person
a
very
pressing
invitation
last
night
which
he
thought
proper
to
saying
which
the
doctor
scowled
magnanimously
on
the
stranger
and
whispered
his
friend
lieutenant
tappleton
you
don
t
say
so
said
that
gentleman
at
the
conclusion
of
the
whisper
i
do
indeed
replied
doctor
slammer
you
are
bound
to
kick
him
on
the
spot
murmured
the
owner
of
the
stool
with
great
importance
do
be
quiet
payne
interposed
the
lieutenant
will
you
allow
me
to
ask
you
sir
he
said
addressing
pickwick
who
was
considerably
mystified
by
this
very
unpolite
will
you
allow
me
to
ask
you
sir
whether
that
person
belongs
to
your
party
no
sir
replied
pickwick
he
is
a
guest
of
he
is
a
member
of
your
club
or
i
am
mistaken
said
the
lieutenant
inquiringly
certainly
not
responded
pickwick
and
never
wears
your
said
the
lieutenant
no
never
replied
the
astonished
pickwick
lieutenant
tappleton
turned
round
to
his
friend
doctor
slammer
with
a
scarcely
perceptible
shrug
of
the
shoulder
as
if
implying
some
doubt
of
the
accuracy
of
his
recollection
the
little
doctor
looked
wrathful
but
confounded
and
payne
gazed
with
a
ferocious
aspect
on
the
beaming
countenance
of
the
unconscious
pickwick
sir
said
the
doctor
suddenly
addressing
tupman
in
a
tone
which
made
that
gentleman
start
as
perceptibly
as
if
a
pin
had
been
cunningly
inserted
in
the
calf
of
his
leg
you
were
at
the
ball
here
last
night
tupman
gasped
a
faint
affirmative
looking
very
hard
at
pickwick
all
the
while
that
person
was
your
companion
said
the
doctor
pointing
to
the
still
unmoved
stranger
tupman
admitted
the
fact
now
sir
said
the
doctor
to
the
stranger
i
ask
you
once
again
in
the
presence
of
these
gentlemen
whether
you
choose
to
give
me
your
card
and
to
receive
the
treatment
of
a
gentleman
or
whether
you
impose
upon
me
the
necessity
of
personally
chastising
you
on
the
spot
stay
sir
said
pickwick
i
really
can
not
allow
this
matter
to
go
any
further
without
some
explanation
tupman
recount
the
tupman
thus
solemnly
adjured
stated
the
case
in
a
few
words
touched
slightly
on
the
borrowing
of
the
coat
expatiated
largely
on
its
having
been
done
after
dinner
wound
up
with
a
little
penitence
on
his
own
account
and
left
the
stranger
to
clear
himself
as
best
he
could
he
was
apparently
about
to
proceed
to
do
so
when
lieutenant
tappleton
who
had
been
eyeing
him
with
great
curiosity
said
with
considerable
scorn
haven
t
i
seen
you
at
the
theatre
sir
certainly
replied
the
unabashed
stranger
he
is
a
strolling
actor
said
the
lieutenant
contemptuously
turning
to
doctor
he
acts
in
the
piece
that
the
officers
of
the
get
up
at
the
rochester
theatre
night
you
can
not
proceed
in
this
affair
slammer
impossible
quite
said
the
dignified
payne
sorry
to
have
placed
you
in
this
disagreeable
situation
said
lieutenant
tappleton
addressing
pickwick
allow
me
to
suggest
that
the
best
way
of
avoiding
a
recurrence
of
such
scenes
in
future
will
be
to
be
more
select
in
the
choice
of
your
companions
sir
and
the
lieutenant
bounced
out
of
the
room
and
allow
me
to
say
sir
said
the
irascible
doctor
payne
that
if
i
had
been
tappleton
or
if
i
had
been
slammer
i
would
have
pulled
your
nose
sir
and
the
nose
of
every
man
in
this
company
i
would
sir
every
man
payne
is
my
name
sir
doctor
payne
of
the
evening
having
concluded
this
speech
and
uttered
the
last
three
words
in
a
loud
key
he
stalked
majestically
after
his
friend
closely
followed
by
doctor
slammer
who
said
nothing
but
contented
himself
by
withering
the
company
with
a
look
rising
rage
and
extreme
bewilderment
had
swelled
the
noble
breast
of
pickwick
almost
to
the
bursting
of
his
waistcoat
during
the
delivery
of
the
above
defiance
he
stood
transfixed
to
the
spot
gazing
on
vacancy
the
closing
of
the
door
recalled
him
to
himself
he
rushed
forward
with
fury
in
his
looks
and
fire
in
his
eye
his
hand
was
upon
the
lock
of
the
door
in
another
instant
it
would
have
been
on
the
throat
of
doctor
payne
of
the
had
not
snodgrass
seized
his
revered
leader
by
the
coat
tail
and
dragged
him
backwards
restrain
him
cried
snodgrass
winkle
tupman
he
must
not
peril
his
distinguished
life
in
such
a
cause
as
let
me
go
said
pickwick
hold
him
tight
shouted
snodgrass
and
by
the
united
efforts
of
the
whole
company
pickwick
was
forced
into
an
leave
him
alone
said
the
stranger
jolly
old
gentleman
lots
of
pluck
swallow
this
ah
capital
having
previously
tested
the
virtues
of
a
bumper
which
had
been
mixed
by
the
dismal
man
the
stranger
applied
the
glass
to
pickwick
s
mouth
and
the
remainder
of
its
contents
rapidly
disappeared
there
was
a
short
pause
the
had
done
its
work
the
amiable
countenance
of
pickwick
was
fast
recovering
its
customary
expression
they
are
not
worth
your
notice
said
the
dismal
man
you
are
right
sir
replied
pickwick
they
are
not
i
am
ashamed
to
have
been
betrayed
into
this
warmth
of
feeling
draw
your
chair
up
to
the
table
the
dismal
man
readily
complied
a
circle
was
again
formed
round
the
table
and
harmony
once
more
prevailed
some
lingering
irritability
appeared
to
find
a
in
winkle
s
bosom
occasioned
possibly
by
the
temporary
abstraction
of
his
coat
though
it
is
scarcely
reasonable
to
suppose
that
so
slight
a
circumstance
can
have
excited
even
a
passing
feeling
of
anger
in
a
pickwickian
s
breast
with
this
exception
their
was
completely
restored
and
the
evening
concluded
with
the
conviviality
with
which
it
had
begun
chapter
iv
a
field
day
and
bivouac
more
new
friends
an
invitation
to
the
country
many
authors
entertain
not
only
a
foolish
but
a
really
dishonest
objection
to
acknowledge
the
sources
whence
they
derive
much
valuable
information
we
have
no
such
feeling
we
are
merely
endeavouring
to
discharge
in
an
upright
manner
the
responsible
duties
of
our
editorial
functions
and
whatever
ambition
we
might
have
felt
under
other
circumstances
to
lay
claim
to
the
authorship
of
these
adventures
a
regard
for
truth
forbids
us
to
do
more
than
claim
the
merit
of
their
judicious
arrangement
and
impartial
narration
the
pickwick
papers
are
our
new
river
head
and
we
may
be
compared
to
the
new
river
company
the
labours
of
others
have
raised
for
us
an
immense
reservoir
of
important
facts
we
merely
lay
them
on
and
communicate
them
in
a
clear
and
gentle
stream
through
the
medium
of
these
pages
to
a
world
thirsting
for
pickwickian
knowledge
acting
in
this
spirit
and
resolutely
proceeding
on
our
determination
to
avow
our
obligations
to
the
authorities
we
have
consulted
we
frankly
say
that
to
the
of
snodgrass
are
we
indebted
for
the
particulars
recorded
in
this
and
the
succeeding
chapter
particulars
which
now
that
we
have
disburdened
our
consciences
we
shall
proceed
to
detail
without
further
comment
the
whole
population
of
rochester
and
the
adjoining
towns
rose
from
their
beds
at
an
early
hour
of
the
following
morning
in
a
state
of
the
utmost
bustle
and
excitement
a
grand
review
was
to
take
place
upon
the
lines
the
manoeuvres
of
half
a
dozen
regiments
were
to
be
inspected
by
the
eagle
eye
of
the
temporary
fortifications
had
been
erected
the
citadel
was
to
be
attacked
and
taken
and
a
mine
was
to
be
sprung
pickwick
was
as
our
readers
may
have
gathered
from
the
slight
extract
we
gave
from
his
description
of
chatham
an
enthusiastic
admirer
of
the
army
nothing
could
have
been
more
delightful
to
him
nothing
could
have
harmonised
so
well
with
the
peculiar
feeling
of
each
of
his
companions
as
this
sight
accordingly
they
were
soon
afoot
and
walking
in
the
direction
of
the
scene
of
action
towards
which
crowds
of
people
were
already
pouring
from
a
variety
of
quarters
the
appearance
of
everything
on
the
lines
denoted
that
the
approaching
ceremony
was
one
of
the
utmost
grandeur
and
importance
there
were
sentries
posted
to
keep
the
ground
for
the
troops
and
servants
on
the
batteries
keeping
places
for
the
ladies
and
sergeants
running
to
and
fro
with
books
under
their
arms
and
colonel
bulder
in
full
military
uniform
on
horseback
galloping
first
to
one
place
and
then
to
another
and
backing
his
horse
among
the
people
and
prancing
and
curvetting
and
shouting
in
a
most
alarming
manner
and
making
himself
very
hoarse
in
the
voice
and
very
red
in
the
face
without
any
assignable
cause
or
reason
whatever
officers
were
running
backwards
and
forwards
first
communicating
with
colonel
bulder
and
then
ordering
the
sergeants
and
then
running
away
altogether
and
even
the
very
privates
themselves
looked
from
behind
their
glazed
stocks
with
an
air
of
mysterious
solemnity
which
sufficiently
bespoke
the
special
nature
of
the
occasion
pickwick
and
his
three
companions
stationed
themselves
in
the
front
of
the
crowd
and
patiently
awaited
the
commencement
of
the
proceedings
the
throng
was
increasing
every
moment
and
the
efforts
they
were
compelled
to
make
to
retain
the
position
they
had
gained
sufficiently
occupied
their
attention
during
the
two
hours
that
ensued
at
one
time
there
was
a
sudden
pressure
from
behind
and
then
pickwick
was
jerked
forward
for
several
yards
with
a
degree
of
speed
and
elasticity
highly
inconsistent
with
the
general
gravity
of
his
demeanour
at
another
moment
there
was
a
request
to
keep
back
from
the
front
and
then
the
of
a
musket
was
either
dropped
upon
pickwick
s
toe
to
remind
him
of
the
demand
or
thrust
into
his
chest
to
insure
its
being
complied
with
then
some
facetious
gentlemen
on
the
left
after
pressing
sideways
in
a
body
and
squeezing
snodgrass
into
the
very
last
extreme
of
human
torture
would
request
to
know
vere
he
vos
a
shovin
to
and
when
winkle
had
done
expressing
his
excessive
indignation
at
witnessing
this
unprovoked
assault
some
person
behind
would
knock
his
hat
over
his
eyes
and
beg
the
favour
of
his
putting
his
head
in
his
pocket
these
and
other
practical
witticisms
coupled
with
the
unaccountable
absence
of
tupman
who
had
suddenly
disappeared
and
was
nowhere
to
be
found
rendered
their
situation
upon
the
whole
rather
more
uncomfortable
than
pleasing
or
desirable
at
length
that
low
roar
of
many
voices
ran
through
the
crowd
which
usually
announces
the
arrival
of
whatever
they
have
been
waiting
for
all
eyes
were
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
a
few
moments
of
eager
expectation
and
colours
were
seen
fluttering
gaily
in
the
air
arms
glistened
brightly
in
the
sun
column
after
column
poured
on
to
the
plain
the
troops
halted
and
formed
the
word
of
command
rang
through
the
line
there
was
a
general
clash
of
muskets
as
arms
were
presented
and
the
attended
by
colonel
bulder
and
numerous
officers
cantered
to
the
front
the
military
bands
struck
up
altogether
the
horses
stood
upon
two
legs
each
cantered
backwards
and
whisked
their
tails
about
in
all
directions
the
dogs
barked
the
mob
screamed
the
troops
recovered
and
nothing
was
to
be
seen
on
either
side
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
but
a
long
perspective
of
red
coats
and
white
trousers
fixed
and
motionless
pickwick
had
been
so
fully
occupied
in
falling
about
and
disentangling
himself
miraculously
from
between
the
legs
of
horses
that
he
had
not
enjoyed
sufficient
leisure
to
observe
the
scene
before
him
until
it
assumed
the
appearance
we
have
just
described
when
he
was
at
last
enabled
to
stand
firmly
on
his
legs
his
gratification
and
delight
were
unbounded
can
anything
be
finer
or
more
delightful
he
inquired
of
winkle
nothing
replied
that
gentleman
who
had
had
a
short
man
standing
on
each
of
his
feet
for
the
quarter
of
an
hour
immediately
preceding
it
is
indeed
a
noble
and
a
brilliant
sight
said
snodgrass
in
whose
bosom
a
blaze
of
poetry
was
rapidly
bursting
forth
to
see
the
gallant
defenders
of
their
country
drawn
up
in
brilliant
array
before
its
peaceful
citizens
their
faces
beaming
not
with
warlike
ferocity
but
with
civilised
gentleness
their
eyes
flashing
not
with
the
rude
fire
of
rapine
or
revenge
but
with
the
soft
light
of
humanity
and
pickwick
fully
entered
into
the
spirit
of
this
eulogium
but
he
could
not
exactly
its
terms
for
the
soft
light
of
intelligence
burned
rather
feebly
in
the
eyes
of
the
warriors
inasmuch
as
the
command
eyes
front
had
been
given
and
all
the
spectator
saw
before
him
was
several
thousand
pair
of
optics
staring
straight
forward
wholly
divested
of
any
expression
whatever
we
are
in
a
capital
situation
now
said
pickwick
looking
round
him
the
crowd
had
gradually
dispersed
in
their
immediate
vicinity
and
they
were
nearly
alone
capital
echoed
both
snodgrass
and
winkle
what
are
they
doing
now
inquired
pickwick
adjusting
his
spectacles
i
i
rather
think
said
winkle
changing
colour
i
rather
think
they
re
going
to
nonsense
said
pickwick
hastily
i
i
really
think
they
are
urged
snodgrass
somewhat
alarmed
impossible
replied
pickwick
he
had
hardly
uttered
the
word
when
the
whole
regiments
levelled
their
muskets
as
if
they
had
but
one
common
object
and
that
object
the
pickwickians
and
burst
forth
with
the
most
awful
and
tremendous
discharge
that
ever
shook
the
earth
to
its
centres
or
an
elderly
gentleman
off
his
it
was
in
this
trying
situation
exposed
to
a
galling
fire
of
blank
cartridges
and
harassed
by
the
operations
of
the
military
a
fresh
body
of
whom
had
begun
to
fall
in
on
the
opposite
side
that
pickwick
displayed
that
perfect
coolness
and
which
are
the
indispensable
accompaniments
of
a
great
mind
he
seized
winkle
by
the
arm
and
placing
himself
between
that
gentleman
and
snodgrass
earnestly
besought
them
to
remember
that
beyond
the
possibility
of
being
rendered
deaf
by
the
noise
there
was
no
immediate
danger
to
be
apprehended
from
the
firing
but
but
suppose
some
of
the
men
should
happen
to
have
ball
cartridges
by
mistake
remonstrated
winkle
pallid
at
the
supposition
he
was
himself
conjuring
up
i
heard
something
whistle
through
the
air
now
so
sharp
close
to
my
we
had
better
throw
ourselves
on
our
faces
hadn
t
we
said
snodgrass
no
no
it
s
over
now
said
pickwick
his
lip
might
quiver
and
his
cheek
might
blanch
but
no
expression
of
fear
or
concern
escaped
the
lips
of
that
immortal
man
pickwick
was
right
the
firing
ceased
but
he
had
scarcely
time
to
congratulate
himself
on
the
accuracy
of
his
opinion
when
a
quick
movement
was
visible
in
the
line
the
hoarse
shout
of
the
word
of
command
ran
along
it
and
before
either
of
the
party
could
form
a
guess
at
the
meaning
of
this
new
manoeuvre
the
whole
of
the
regiments
with
fixed
bayonets
charged
at
time
down
upon
the
very
spot
on
which
pickwick
and
his
friends
were
stationed
man
is
but
mortal
and
there
is
a
point
beyond
which
human
courage
can
not
extend
pickwick
gazed
through
his
spectacles
for
an
instant
on
the
advancing
mass
and
then
fairly
turned
his
back
and
we
will
not
say
fled
firstly
because
it
is
an
ignoble
term
and
secondly
because
pickwick
s
figure
was
by
no
means
adapted
for
that
mode
of
retreat
he
trotted
away
at
as
quick
a
rate
as
his
legs
would
convey
him
so
quickly
indeed
that
he
did
not
perceive
the
awkwardness
of
his
situation
to
the
full
extent
until
too
late
the
opposite
troops
whose
had
perplexed
pickwick
a
few
seconds
before
were
drawn
up
to
repel
the
mimic
attack
of
the
sham
besiegers
of
the
citadel
and
the
consequence
was
that
pickwick
and
his
two
companions
found
themselves
suddenly
inclosed
between
two
lines
of
great
length
the
one
advancing
at
a
rapid
pace
and
the
other
firmly
waiting
the
collision
in
hostile
array
hoi
shouted
the
officers
of
the
advancing
line
get
out
of
the
way
cried
the
officers
of
the
stationary
one
where
are
we
to
go
to
screamed
the
agitated
pickwickians
hoi
hoi
hoi
was
the
only
reply
there
was
a
moment
of
intense
bewilderment
a
heavy
tramp
of
footsteps
a
violent
concussion
a
smothered
laugh
the
regiments
were
half
a
thousand
yards
off
and
the
soles
of
pickwick
s
boots
were
elevated
in
air
snodgrass
and
winkle
had
each
performed
a
compulsory
somerset
with
remarkable
agility
when
the
first
object
that
met
the
eyes
of
the
latter
as
he
sat
on
the
ground
staunching
with
a
yellow
silk
handkerchief
the
stream
of
life
which
issued
from
his
nose
was
his
venerated
leader
at
some
distance
off
running
after
his
own
hat
which
was
gambolling
playfully
away
in
perspective
there
are
very
few
moments
in
a
man
s
existence
when
he
experiences
so
much
ludicrous
distress
or
meets
with
so
little
charitable
commiseration
as
when
he
is
in
pursuit
of
his
own
hat
a
vast
deal
of
coolness
and
a
peculiar
degree
of
judgment
are
requisite
in
catching
a
hat
a
man
must
not
be
precipitate
or
he
runs
over
it
he
must
not
rush
into
the
opposite
extreme
or
he
loses
it
altogether
the
best
way
is
to
keep
gently
up
with
the
object
of
pursuit
to
be
wary
and
cautious
to
watch
your
opportunity
well
get
gradually
before
it
then
make
a
rapid
dive
seize
it
by
the
crown
and
stick
it
firmly
on
your
head
smiling
pleasantly
all
the
time
as
if
you
thought
it
as
good
a
joke
as
anybody
else
there
was
a
fine
gentle
wind
and
pickwick
s
hat
rolled
sportively
before
it
the
wind
puffed
and
pickwick
puffed
and
the
hat
rolled
over
and
over
as
merrily
as
a
lively
porpoise
in
a
strong
tide
and
on
it
might
have
rolled
far
beyond
pickwick
s
reach
had
not
its
course
been
providentially
stopped
just
as
that
gentleman
was
on
the
point
of
resigning
it
to
its
fate
pickwick
we
say
was
completely
exhausted
and
about
to
give
up
the
chase
when
the
hat
was
blown
with
some
violence
against
the
wheel
of
a
carriage
which
was
drawn
up
in
a
line
with
half
a
dozen
other
vehicles
on
the
spot
to
which
his
steps
had
been
directed
pickwick
perceiving
his
advantage
darted
briskly
forward
secured
his
property
planted
it
on
his
head
and
paused
to
take
breath
he
had
not
been
stationary
half
a
minute
when
he
heard
his
own
name
eagerly
pronounced
by
a
voice
which
he
at
once
recognised
as
tupman
s
and
looking
upwards
he
beheld
a
sight
which
filled
him
with
surprise
and
pleasure
in
an
open
barouche
the
horses
of
which
had
been
taken
out
the
better
to
accommodate
it
to
the
crowded
place
stood
a
stout
old
gentleman
in
a
blue
coat
and
bright
buttons
corduroy
breeches
and
two
young
ladies
in
scarfs
and
feathers
a
young
gentleman
apparently
enamoured
of
one
of
the
young
ladies
in
scarfs
and
feathers
a
lady
of
doubtful
age
probably
the
aunt
of
the
aforesaid
and
tupman
as
easy
and
unconcerned
as
if
he
had
belonged
to
the
family
from
the
first
moments
of
his
infancy
fastened
up
behind
the
barouche
was
a
hamper
of
spacious
dimensions
one
of
those
hampers
which
always
awakens
in
a
contemplative
mind
associations
connected
with
cold
fowls
tongues
and
bottles
of
wine
and
on
the
box
sat
a
fat
and
boy
in
a
state
of
somnolency
whom
no
speculative
observer
could
have
regarded
for
an
instant
without
setting
down
as
the
official
dispenser
of
the
contents
of
the
hamper
when
the
proper
time
for
their
consumption
should
arrive
pickwick
had
bestowed
a
hasty
glance
on
these
interesting
objects
when
he
was
again
greeted
by
his
faithful
disciple
pickwick
pickwick
said
tupman
come
up
here
make
come
along
sir
pray
come
up
said
the
stout
gentleman
joe
damn
that
boy
he
s
gone
to
sleep
joe
let
down
the
the
fat
boy
rolled
slowly
off
the
box
let
down
the
steps
and
held
the
carriage
door
invitingly
open
snodgrass
and
winkle
came
up
at
the
moment

the
stout
man
two
inside
and
one
out
joe
make
room
for
one
of
these
gentlemen
on
the
box
now
sir
come
along
and
the
stout
gentleman
extended
his
arm
and
pulled
first
pickwick
and
then
snodgrass
into
the
barouche
by
main
force
winkle
mounted
to
the
box
the
fat
boy
waddled
to
the
same
perch
and
fell
fast
asleep
instantly
well
gentlemen
said
the
stout
man
very
glad

and
cordially
shook

the
stout
gentleman
in
the
well
and
how

said
the
stout
gentleman
addressing

and
the
stout
gentleman
playfully
inserted
his
elbow
between
the
ribs
of
pickwick
and
laughed
very
heartily
lor
brother
said
miss
wardle
with
a
deprecating
smile
true

said
the
stout
gentleman
no
one
can
deny
it
gentlemen
i
beg
your
pardon
this
is
my
friend
trundle
and
now
you
all
know
each
other
let
s
be
comfortable
and
happy
and
see
what
s
going
forward
that
s
what
i
so
the
stout
gentleman
put
on
his
spectacles
and
pickwick
pulled
out
his
glass
and
everybody
stood
up
in
the
carriage
and
looked
over
somebody
else
s
shoulder
at
the
evolutions
of
the
military
astounding
evolutions
they
were
one
rank
firing
over
the
heads
of
another
rank
and
then
running
away
and
then
the
other
rank
firing
over
the
heads
of
another
rank
and
running
away
in
their
turn
and
then
forming
squares
with
officers
in
the
centre
and
then
descending
the
trench
on
one
side
with
and
ascending
it
on
the
other
again
by
the
same
means
and
knocking
down
barricades
of
baskets
and
behaving
in
the
most
gallant
manner
possible
then
there
was
such
a
ramming
down
of
the
contents
of
enormous
guns
on
the
battery
with
instruments
like
magnified
mops
such
a
preparation
before
they
were
let
off
and
such
an
awful
noise
when
they
did
go
that
the
air
resounded
with
the
screams
of
ladies
the
young
misses
wardle
were
so
frightened
that
trundle
was
actually
obliged
to
hold
one
of
them
up
in
the
carriage
while
snodgrass
supported
the
other
and
wardle
s
sister
suffered
under
such
a
dreadful
state
of
nervous
alarm
that
tupman
found
it
indispensably
necessary
to
put
his
arm
round
her
waist
to
keep
her
up
at
all
everybody
was
excited
except
the
fat
boy
and
he
slept
as
soundly
as
if
the
roaring
of
cannon
were
his
ordinary
lullaby
joe
joe
said
the
stout
gentleman
when
the
citadel
was
taken
and
the
besiegers
and
besieged
sat
down
to
dinner
damn
that
boy
he
s
gone
to
sleep
again
be
good
enough
to
pinch
him
sir
in
the
leg
if
you
please
nothing
else
wakes
him
thank
you
undo
the
hamper
the
fat
boy
who
had
been
effectually
roused
by
the
compression
of
a
portion
of
his
leg
between
the
finger
and
thumb
of
winkle
rolled
off
the
box
once
again
and
proceeded
to
unpack
the
hamper
with
more
expedition
than
could
have
been
expected
from
his
previous
inactivity
now
we
must
sit
close
said
the
stout
gentleman
after
a
great
many
jokes
about
squeezing
the
ladies
sleeves
and
a
vast
quantity
of
blushing
at
sundry
jocose
proposals
that
the
ladies
should
sit
in
the
gentlemen
s
laps
the
whole
party
were
stowed
down
in
the
barouche
and
the
stout
gentleman
proceeded
to
hand
the
things
from
the
fat
boy
who
had
mounted
up
behind
for
the
purpose
into
the
carriage
now
joe
knives
and
the
knives
and
forks
were
handed
in
and
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
inside
and
winkle
on
the
box
were
each
furnished
with
those
useful
instruments
plates
joe
a
similar
process
employed
in
the
distribution
of
the
crockery
now
joe
the
fowls
damn
that
boy
he
s
gone
to
sleep
again
joe
joe
sundry
taps
on
the
head
with
a
stick
and
the
fat
boy
with
some
difficulty
roused
from
his
lethargy
come
hand
in
the
there
was
something
in
the
sound
of
the
last
word
which
roused
the
unctuous
boy
he
jumped
up
and
the
leaden
eyes
which
twinkled
behind
his
mountainous
cheeks
leered
horribly
upon
the
food
as
he
unpacked
it
from
the
basket
now
make
haste
said
wardle
for
the
fat
boy
was
hanging
fondly
over
a
capon
which
he
seemed
wholly
unable
to
part
with
the
boy
sighed
deeply
and
bestowing
an
ardent
gaze
upon
its
plumpness
unwillingly
consigned
it
to
his
master
that
s
right
look
sharp

of

the
such
were
the
hurried
orders
which
issued
from
the
lips
of
wardle
as
he
handed
in
the
different
articles
described
and
placed
dishes
in
everybody
s
hands
and
on
everybody
s
knees
in
endless
number
now
ain
t
this
capital
inquired
that
jolly
personage

the
work
of
destruction

commenced

box

winkle
emptied
his
glass
and
placed
the
bottle
on
the
by
his
side
will
you
permit
me
to
have
the
pleasure
sir
said
trundle
to
winkle
with
great
pleasure
replied
winkle
to
trundle
and
then
the
two
gentlemen
took
wine
after
which
they
took
a
glass
of
wine
round
ladies
and
all
how
dear
emily
is
flirting
with
the
strange
gentleman
whispered
the
spinster
aunt
with
true
envy
to
her
brother
wardle

said
the
jolly
old
gentleman
all
very
natural
i
dare
say
nothing
unusual
pickwick
some
wine
sir
pickwick
who
had
been
deeply
investigating
the
interior
of
the
readily
assented
emily

the
spinster
aunt
with
a
patronising
air

whispered
miss
isabella
wardle
to
her
sister
emily
the
young
ladies
laughed
very
heartily
and
the
old
one
tried
to
look
amiable
but
couldn
t
manage
it
young
girls
have
such
spirits
said
miss
wardle
to
tupman
with
an
air
of
gentle
commiseration
as
if
animal
spirits
were
contraband
and
their
possession
without
a
permit
a
high
crime
and
misdemeanour
oh
they
have
replied
tupman
not
exactly
making
the
sort
of
reply
that
was
expected
from
him
it
s
quite
hem
said
miss
wardle
rather
dubiously
will
you
permit
me
said
tupman
in
his
blandest
manner
touching
the
enchanting
rachael
s
wrist
with
one
hand
and
gently
elevating
the
bottle
with
the
other
will
you
permit
me
oh
sir
tupman
looked
most
impressive
and
rachael
expressed
her
fear
that
more
guns
were
going
off
in
which
case
of
course
she
should
have
required
support
again
do
you
think
my
dear
nieces
pretty
whispered
their
affectionate
aunt
to
tupman
i
should
if
their
aunt
wasn
t
here
replied
the
ready
pickwickian
with
a
passionate
glance
oh
you
naughty
man
but
really
if
their
complexions

a
little
better
don
t
you
think
they
would
be
girls
by
candlelight
yes

think

would
said
tupman
with
an
air
of
indifference
oh

quiz
i
know
what
you
were
going
to
what
inquired
tupman
who
had
not
precisely
made
up
his
mind
to
say
anything

all
you
were
going
to
say
that
isabel
stoops
i
know
you
were
you
men

such
observers

so
she
does
it
can
t
be
denied
and
certainly
if
there
is
one
thing
more
than
another
that
makes
a
girl
look
ugly
it
is
stooping
i
often
tell
her
that
when
she
gets
a
little
older
she
ll
be
quite
frightful
well
you
are
a
quiz
tupman
had
no
objection
to
earning
the
reputation
at
so
cheap
a
rate
so
he
looked
very
knowing
and
smiled
mysteriously
what
a
sarcastic
smile
said
the
admiring
rachael
i
declare
i
m
quite
afraid
of
afraid
of
me
oh
you
can
t
disguise
anything
from
me
i
know
what
that
smile
means
very
what
said
tupman
who
had
not
the
slightest
notion
himself
you
mean
said
the
amiable
aunt
sinking
her
voice
still
lower
you
mean
that
you
don
t
think
isabella
s
stooping
is
as
bad
as
emily
s
boldness
well
she
is
bold
you
can
not
think
how
wretched
it
makes
me
sometimes
i
m
sure
i
cry
about
it
for
hours
together
my
dear
brother
is
good
and
so
unsuspicious
that
he
never
sees
it
if
he
did
i
m
quite
certain
it
would
break
his
heart
i
wish
i
could
think
it
was
only
manner
i
hope
it
may
be
here
the
affectionate
relative
heaved
a
deep
sigh
and
shook
her
head
despondingly
i
m
sure
aunt
s
talking
about
us
whispered
miss
emily
wardle
to
her
sister
i
m
quite
certain
of
it
she
looks
so
is
she
replied
hem
aunt
dear
yes
my
dear
love
i
m
afraid
you
ll
catch
cold
aunt
have
a
silk
handkerchief
to
tie
round
your
dear
old
head
you
really
should
take
care
of
yourself
consider
your
age
however
well
deserved
this
piece
of
retaliation
might
have
been
it
was
as
vindictive
a
one
as
could
well
have
been
resorted
to
there
is
no
guessing
in
what
form
of
reply
the
aunt
s
indignation
would
have
vented
itself
had
not
wardle
unconsciously
changed
the
subject
by
calling
emphatically
for
joe
damn
that
boy
said
the
old
gentleman
he
s
gone
to
sleep
very
extraordinary
boy
that
said
pickwick
does
he
always
sleep
in
this
way
sleep
said
the
old
gentleman
he
s
always
asleep
goes
on
errands
fast
asleep
and
snores
as
he
waits
at
how
very
odd
said
pickwick
ah
odd
indeed
returned
the
old
gentleman
i
m
proud
of
that
boy
wouldn
t
part
with
him
on
any
account
he
s
a
natural
curiosity
here
joe
joe
take
these
things
away
and
open
another
bottle
d
ye
hear
the
fat
boy
rose
opened
his
eyes
swallowed
the
huge
piece
of
pie
he
had
been
in
the
act
of
masticating
when
he
last
fell
asleep
and
slowly
obeyed
his
master
s
orders
gloating
languidly
over
the
remains
of
the
feast
as
he
removed
the
plates
and
deposited
them
in
the
hamper
the
fresh
bottle
was
produced
and
speedily
emptied
the
hamper
was
made
fast
in
its
old
place
the
fat
boy
once
more
mounted
the
box
the
spectacles
and
were
again
adjusted
and
the
evolutions
of
the
military
recommenced
there
was
a
great
fizzing
and
banging
of
guns
and
starting
of
ladies
and
then
a
mine
was
sprung
to
the
gratification
of
everybody
and
when
the
mine
had
gone
off
the
military
and
the
company
followed
its
example
and
went
off
too
now

said
the
old
gentleman
as
he
shook
hands
with
pickwick
at
the
conclusion
of
a
conversation
which
had
been
carried
on
at
intervals
during
the
conclusion
of
the
proceedings
we
shall
see

replied
pickwick

pickwick

the

the

mounted
the
fat
boy
clambered
up
by
his
side
farewells
were
exchanged
and
the
carriage
rattled
off
as
the
pickwickians
turned
round
to
take
a
last
glimpse
of
it
the
setting
sun
cast
a
rich
glow
on
the
faces
of
their
entertainers
and
fell
upon
the
form
of
the
fat
boy
his
head
was
sunk
upon
his
bosom
and
he
slumbered
again
chapter
a
short
one
showing
among
other
matters
how
pickwick
undertook
to
drive
and
winkle
to
ride
and
how
they
both
did
it
bright
and
pleasant
was
the
sky
balmy
the
air
and
beautiful
the
appearance
of
every
object
around
as
pickwick
leaned
over
the
balustrades
of
rochester
bridge
contemplating
nature
and
waiting
for
breakfast
the
scene
was
indeed
one
which
might
well
have
charmed
a
far
less
reflective
mind
than
that
to
which
it
was
presented
on
the
left
of
the
spectator
lay
the
ruined
wall
broken
in
many
places
and
in
some
overhanging
the
narrow
beach
below
in
rude
and
heavy
masses
huge
knots
of
seaweed
hung
upon
the
jagged
and
pointed
stones
trembling
in
every
breath
of
wind
and
the
green
ivy
clung
mournfully
round
the
dark
and
ruined
battlements
behind
it
rose
the
ancient
castle
its
towers
roofless
and
its
massive
walls
crumbling
away
but
telling
us
proudly
of
its
old
might
and
strength
as
when
seven
hundred
years
ago
it
rang
with
the
clash
of
arms
or
resounded
with
the
noise
of
feasting
and
revelry
on
either
side
the
banks
of
the
medway
covered
with
cornfields
and
pastures
with
here
and
there
a
windmill
or
a
distant
church
stretched
away
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
presenting
a
rich
and
varied
landscape
rendered
more
beautiful
by
the
changing
shadows
which
passed
swiftly
across
it
as
the
thin
and
clouds
skimmed
away
in
the
light
of
the
morning
sun
the
river
reflecting
the
clear
blue
of
the
sky
glistened
and
sparkled
as
it
flowed
noiselessly
on
and
the
oars
of
the
fishermen
dipped
into
the
water
with
a
clear
and
liquid
sound
as
their
heavy
but
picturesque
boats
glided
slowly
down
the
stream
pickwick
was
roused
from
the
agreeable
reverie
into
which
he
had
been
led
by
the
objects
before
him
by
a
deep
sigh
and
a
touch
on
his
shoulder
he
turned
round
and
the
dismal
man
was
at
his
side
contemplating
the
scene
inquired
the
dismal
man
i
was
said
pickwick
and
congratulating
yourself
on
being
up
so
soon
pickwick
nodded
assent
ah
people
need
to
rise
early
to
see
the
sun
in
all
his
splendour
for
his
brightness
seldom
lasts
the
day
through
the
morning
of
day
and
the
morning
of
life
are
but
too
much
you
speak
truly
sir
said
pickwick
how
common
the
saying
continued
the
dismal
man
the
morning
s
too
fine
to
how
well
might
it
be
applied
to
our
everyday
existence
god
what
would
i
forfeit
to
have
the
days
of
my
childhood
restored
or
to
be
able
to
forget
them
for
ever
you
have
seen
much
trouble
sir
said
pickwick
compassionately
i
have
said
the
dismal
man
hurriedly
i
have
more
than
those
who
see
me
now
would
believe
he
paused
for
an
instant
and
then
said
abruptly
did
it
ever
strike
you
on
such
a
morning
as
this
that
drowning
would
be
happiness
and
peace
god
bless
me
no
replied
pickwick
edging
a
little
from
the
balustrade
as
the
possibility
of
the
dismal
man
s
tipping
him
over
by
way
of
experiment
occurred
to
him
rather
forcibly
i
have
thought
so
often
said
the
dismal
man
without
noticing
the
action
the
calm
cool
water
seems
to
me
to
murmur
an
invitation
to
repose
and
rest
a
bound
a
splash
a
brief
struggle
there
is
an
eddy
for
an
instant
it
gradually
subsides
into
a
gentle
ripple
the
waters
have
closed
above
your
head
and
the
world
has
closed
upon
your
miseries
and
misfortunes
for
the
sunken
eye
of
the
dismal
man
flashed
brightly
as
he
spoke
but
the
momentary
excitement
quickly
subsided
and
he
turned
calmly
away
as
he
said
there
enough
of
that
i
wish
to
see
you
on
another
subject
you
invited
me
to
read
that
paper
the
night
before
last
and
listened
attentively
while
i
did
i
did
replied
pickwick
and
i
certainly
thought
i
asked
for
no
opinion
said
the
dismal
man
interrupting
him
and
i
want
none
you
are
travelling
for
amusement
and
instruction
suppose
i
forward
you
a
curious
manuscript
observe
not
curious
because
wild
or
improbable
but
curious
as
a
leaf
from
the
romance
of
real
life
would
you
communicate
it
to
the
club
of
which
you
have
spoken
so
frequently
certainly
replied
pickwick
if
you
wished
it
and
it
would
be
entered
on
their
you
shall
have
it
replied
the
dismal
man
your
address
and
pickwick
having
communicated
their
probable
route
the
dismal
man
carefully
noted
it
down
in
a
greasy
and
resisting
pickwick
s
pressing
invitation
to
breakfast
left
that
gentleman
at
his
inn
and
walked
slowly
away
pickwick
found
that
his
three
companions
had
risen
and
were
waiting
his
arrival
to
commence
breakfast
which
was
ready
laid
in
tempting
display
they
sat
down
to
the
meal
and
broiled
ham
eggs
tea
coffee
and
sundries
began
to
disappear
with
a
rapidity
which
at
once
bore
testimony
to
the
excellence
of
the
fare
and
the
appetites
of
its
consumers
now
about
manor
farm
said
pickwick
how
shall
we
go
we
had
better
consult
the
waiter
perhaps
said
tupman
and
the
waiter
was
summoned
accordingly

to

said
snodgrass
perhaps
one
of
the
gentlemen
would
like
to
ride
sir
suggested
the
waiter
looking
towards
winkle
very
good
sir
any
of
wardle
s
men
coming
to
rochester
bring
em
back
the
very
thing
said
pickwick
winkle
will
you
go
on
horseback
now
winkle
did
entertain
considerable
misgivings
in
the
very
lowest
recesses
of
his
own
heart
relative
to
his
equestrian
skill
but
as
he
would
not
have
them
even
suspected
on
any
account
he
at
once
replied
with
great
hardihood
certainly
i
should
enjoy
it
of
all
winkle
had
rushed
upon
his
fate
there
was
no
resource
let
them
be
at
the
door
by
eleven
said
pickwick
very
well
sir
replied
the
waiter
the
waiter
retired
the
breakfast
concluded
and
the
travellers
ascended
to
their
respective
bedrooms
to
prepare
a
change
of
clothing
to
take
with
them
on
their
approaching
expedition
pickwick
had
made
his
preliminary
arrangements
and
was
looking
over
the
blinds
at
the
passengers
in
the
street
when
the
waiter
entered
and
announced
that
the
chaise
was
ready
an
announcement
which
the
vehicle
itself
confirmed
by
forthwith
appearing
before
the
room
blinds
aforesaid
it
was
a
curious
little
green
box
on
four
wheels
with
a
low
place
like
a
for
two
behind
and
an
elevated
perch
for
one
in
front
drawn
by
an
immense
brown
horse
displaying
great
symmetry
of
bone
an
hostler
stood
near
holding
by
the
bridle
another
immense
horse
apparently
a
near
relative
of
the
animal
in
the
chaise
ready
saddled
for
winkle
bless
my
soul
said
pickwick
as
they
stood
upon
the
pavement
while
the
coats
were
being
put
in
bless
my
soul
who
s
to
drive
i
never
thought
of
oh
you
of
course
said
tupman
of
course
said
snodgrass
i
exclaimed
pickwick
not
the
slightest
fear
sir
interposed
the
hostler
warrant
him
quiet
sir
a
hinfant
in
arms
might
drive
he
don
t
shy
does
he
inquired
pickwick
shy
sir
wouldn
t
shy
if
he
was
to
meet
a
of
monkeys
with
their
tails
burned
the
last
recommendation
was
indisputable
tupman
and
snodgrass
got
into
the
bin
pickwick
ascended
to
his
perch
and
deposited
his
feet
on
a
shelf
erected
beneath
it
for
that
purpose
now
shiny
villiam
said
the
hostler
to
the
deputy
hostler
give
the
gen
lm
n
the
shiny
villiam
so
called
probably
from
his
sleek
hair
and
oily
countenance
placed
the
reins
in
pickwick
s
left
hand
and
the
upper
hostler
thrust
a
whip
into
his
right
cried
pickwick
as
the
tall
quadruped
evinced
a
decided
inclination
to
back
into
the
window
echoed
tupman
and
snodgrass
from
the
bin
only
his
playfulness
gen
lm
n
said
the
head
hostler
encouragingly
jist
kitch
hold
on
him
the
deputy
restrained
the
animal
s
impetuosity
and
the
principal
ran
to
assist
winkle
in
mounting
t
other
side
sir
if
you
blowed
if
the
gen
lm
n
worn
t
up
on
the
wrong
side
whispered
a
grinning
to
the
inexpressibly
gratified
waiter
winkle
thus
instructed
climbed
into
his
saddle
with
about
as
much
difficulty
as
he
would
have
experienced
in
getting
up
the
side
of
a
all
right
inquired
pickwick
with
an
inward
presentiment
that
it
was
all
wrong
all
right
replied
winkle
faintly
let
em
go
cried
the
hold
him
in
sir
and
away
went
the
chaise
and
the
with
pickwick
on
the
box
of
the
one
and
winkle
on
the
back
of
the
other
to
the
delight
and
gratification
of
the
whole
what
makes
him
go
sideways
said
snodgrass
in
the
bin
to
winkle
in
the
saddle
i
can
t
imagine
replied
winkle
his
horse
was
drifting
up
the
street
in
the
most
mysterious
manner
side
first
with
his
head
towards
one
side
of
the
way
and
his
tail
towards
the
other
pickwick
had
no
leisure
to
observe
either
this
or
any
other
particular
the
whole
of
his
faculties
being
concentrated
in
the
management
of
the
animal
attached
to
the
chaise
who
displayed
various
peculiarities
highly
interesting
to
a
bystander
but
by
no
means
equally
amusing
to
any
one
seated
behind
him
besides
constantly
jerking
his
head
up
in
a
very
unpleasant
and
uncomfortable
manner
and
tugging
at
the
reins
to
an
extent
which
rendered
it
a
matter
of
great
difficulty
for
pickwick
to
hold
them
he
had
a
singular
propensity
for
darting
suddenly
every
now
and
then
to
the
side
of
the
road
then
stopping
short
and
then
rushing
forward
for
some
minutes
at
a
speed
which
it
was
wholly
impossible
to
control
what
he
mean
by
this
said
snodgrass
when
the
horse
had
executed
this
manoeuvre
for
the
twentieth
time
i
don
t
know
replied
tupman
it
looks
very
like
shying
don
t
it
snodgrass
was
about
to
reply
when
he
was
interrupted
by
a
shout
from
pickwick
woo
said
that
gentleman
i
have
dropped
my
winkle
said
snodgrass
as
the
equestrian
came
trotting
up
on
the
tall
horse
with
his
hat
over
his
ears
and
shaking
all
over
as
if
he
would
shake
to
pieces
with
the
violence
of
the
exercise
pick
up
the
whip
there
s
a
good
winkle
pulled
at
the
bridle
of
the
tall
horse
till
he
was
black
in
the
face
and
having
at
length
succeeded
in
stopping
him
dismounted
handed
the
whip
to
pickwick
and
grasping
the
reins
prepared
to
remount
now
whether
the
tall
horse
in
the
natural
playfulness
of
his
disposition
was
desirous
of
having
a
little
innocent
recreation
with
winkle
or
whether
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
could
perform
the
journey
as
much
to
his
own
satisfaction
without
a
rider
as
with
one
are
points
upon
which
of
course
we
can
arrive
at
no
definite
and
distinct
conclusion
by
whatever
motives
the
animal
was
actuated
certain
it
is
that
winkle
had
no
sooner
touched
the
reins
than
he
slipped
them
over
his
head
and
darted
backwards
to
their
full
length
poor
fellow
said
winkle
soothingly
poor
fellow
good
old
the
poor
fellow
was
proof
against
flattery
the
more
winkle
tried
to
get
nearer
him
the
more
he
sidled
away
and
notwithstanding
all
kinds
of
coaxing
and
wheedling
there
were
winkle
and
the
horse
going
round
and
round
each
other
for
ten
minutes
at
the
end
of
which
time
each
was
at
precisely
the
same
distance
from
the
other
as
when
they
first
commenced
an
unsatisfactory
sort
of
thing
under
any
circumstances
but
particularly
so
in
a
lonely
road
where
no
assistance
can
be
procured
what
am
i
to
do
shouted
winkle
after
the
dodging
had
been
prolonged
for
a
considerable
time
what
am
i
to
do
i
can
t
get
on
you
had
better
lead
him
till
we
come
to
a
turnpike
replied
pickwick
from
the
chaise
but
he
won
t
come
roared
winkle
do
come
and
hold
pickwick
was
the
very
personation
of
kindness
and
humanity
he
threw
the
reins
on
the
horse
s
back
and
having
descended
from
his
seat
carefully
drew
the
chaise
into
the
hedge
lest
anything
should
come
along
the
road
and
stepped
back
to
the
assistance
of
his
distressed
companion
leaving
tupman
and
snodgrass
in
the
vehicle
the
horse
no
sooner
beheld
pickwick
advancing
towards
him
with
the
chaise
whip
in
his
hand
than
he
exchanged
the
rotary
motion
in
which
he
had
previously
indulged
for
a
retrograde
movement
of
so
very
determined
a
character
that
it
at
once
drew
winkle
who
was
still
at
the
end
of
the
bridle
at
a
rather
quicker
rate
than
fast
walking
in
the
direction
from
which
they
had
just
come
pickwick
ran
to
his
assistance
but
the
faster
pickwick
ran
forward
the
faster
the
horse
ran
backward
there
was
a
great
scraping
of
feet
and
kicking
up
of
the
dust
and
at
last
winkle
his
arms
being
nearly
pulled
out
of
their
sockets
fairly
let
go
his
hold
the
horse
paused
stared
shook
his
head
turned
round
and
quietly
trotted
home
to
rochester
leaving
winkle
and
pickwick
gazing
on
each
other
with
countenances
of
blank
dismay
a
rattling
noise
at
a
little
distance
attracted
their
attention
they
looked
up
bless
my
soul
exclaimed
the
agonised
pickwick
there
s
the
other
horse
running
away
it
was
but
too
true
the
animal
was
startled
by
the
noise
and
the
reins
were
on
his
back
the
results
may
be
guessed
he
tore
off
with
the
wheeled
chaise
behind
him
and
tupman
and
snodgrass
in
the
wheeled
chaise
the
heat
was
a
short
one
tupman
threw
himself
into
the
hedge
snodgrass
followed
his
example
the
horse
dashed
the
four
wheeled
chaise
against
a
wooden
bridge
separated
the
wheels
from
the
body
and
the
bin
from
the
perch
and
finally
stood
stock
still
to
gaze
upon
the
ruin
he
had
made
the
first
care
of
the
two
unspilt
friends
was
to
extricate
their
unfortunate
companions
from
their
bed
of
quickset
a
process
which
gave
them
the
unspeakable
satisfaction
of
discovering
that
they
had
sustained
no
injury
beyond
sundry
rents
in
their
garments
and
various
lacerations
from
the
brambles
the
next
thing
to
be
done
was
to
unharness
the
horse
this
complicated
process
having
been
effected
the
party
walked
slowly
forward
leading
the
horse
among
them
and
abandoning
the
chaise
to
its
fate
an
hour
s
walk
brought
the
travellers
to
a
little
house
with
two
a
horse
trough
and
a
signpost
in
front
one
or
two
deformed
behind
a
kitchen
garden
at
the
side
and
rotten
sheds
and
mouldering
outhouses
jumbled
in
strange
confusion
all
about
it
a
man
was
working
in
the
garden
and
to
him
pickwick
called
lustily
hollo
there
the
man
raised
his
body
shaded
his
eyes
with
his
hand
and
stared
long
and
coolly
at
pickwick
and
his
companions
hollo
there
repeated
pickwick
hollo
was
the
man
s
reply
how
far
is
it
to
dingley
dell
better
er
seven
is
it
a
good
road
no
tain
having
uttered
this
brief
reply
and
apparently
satisfied
himself
with
another
scrutiny
the
man
resumed
his
work
we
want
to
put
this
horse
up
here
said
pickwick
i
suppose
we
can
can
t
we
want
to
put
that
ere
horse
up
do
ee
repeated
the
man
leaning
on
his
spade
of
course
replied
pickwick
who
had
by
this
time
advanced
horse
in
hand
to
the
garden
rails
missus
roared
the
man
with
the
red
head
emerging
from
the
garden
and
looking
very
hard
at
the
horse
missus
a
tall
bony
woman
straight
all
the
way
down
in
a
coarse
blue
pelisse
with
the
waist
an
inch
or
two
below
her
responded
to
the
call
can
we
put
this
horse
up
here
my
good
woman
said
tupman
advancing
and
speaking
in
his
most
seductive
tones
the
woman
looked
very
hard
at
the
whole
party
and
the
man
whispered
something
in
her
ear
no
replied
the
woman
after
a
little
consideration
i
m
afeerd
on
afraid
exclaimed
pickwick
what
s
the
woman
afraid
of
it
got
us
in
trouble
last
time
said
the
woman
turning
into
the
house
i
woan
t
have
nothin
to
say
to
most
extraordinary
thing
i
have
ever
met
with
in
my
life
said
the
astonished
pickwick
i
i
really
believe
whispered
winkle
as
his
friends
gathered
round
him
that
they
think
we
have
come
by
this
horse
in
some
dishonest
what
exclaimed
pickwick
in
a
storm
of
indignation
winkle
modestly
repeated
his
suggestion
hollo
you
fellow
said
the
angry
pickwick
do
you
think
we
stole
the
horse
i
m
sure
ye
did
replied
the
man
with
a
grin
which
agitated
his
countenance
from
one
auricular
organ
to
the
other
saying
which
he
turned
into
the
house
and
banged
the
door
after
him
it
s
like
a
dream
ejaculated
pickwick
a
hideous
dream
the
idea
of
a
man
s
walking
about
all
day
with
a
dreadful
horse
that
he
can
t
get
rid
of
the
depressed
pickwickians
turned
moodily
away
with
the
tall
quadruped
for
which
they
all
felt
the
most
unmitigated
disgust
following
slowly
at
their
heels
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
when
the
four
friends
and
their
companion
turned
into
the
lane
leading
to
manor
farm
and
even
when
they
were
so
near
their
place
of
destination
the
pleasure
they
would
otherwise
have
experienced
was
materially
damped
as
they
reflected
on
the
singularity
of
their
appearance
and
the
absurdity
of
their
situation
torn
clothes
lacerated
faces
dusty
shoes
exhausted
looks
and
above
all
the
horse
oh
how
pickwick
cursed
that
horse
he
had
eyed
the
noble
animal
from
time
to
time
with
looks
expressive
of
hatred
and
revenge
more
than
once
he
had
calculated
the
probable
amount
of
the
expense
he
would
incur
by
cutting
his
throat
and
now
the
temptation
to
destroy
him
or
to
cast
him
loose
upon
the
world
rushed
upon
his
mind
with
tenfold
force
he
was
roused
from
a
meditation
on
these
dire
imaginings
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
two
figures
at
a
turn
of
the
lane
it
was
wardle
and
his
faithful
attendant
the
fat
boy
why
where

the
hospitable
old

joe

joe

from

gentlemen
and
lead
it
into

the
fat
boy
sauntered
heavily
behind
them
with
the
animal
and
the
old
gentleman
condoling
with
his
guests
in
homely
phrase
on
so
much
of
the
day

adventures
as
they
thought
proper

three
or
four
buxom
girls
speedily
dispersed
in
search
of
the
different
articles
in
requisition
while
a
couple
of
visaged
males
rose
from
their
seats
in
the
for
although
it
was
a
may
evening
their
attachment
to
the
wood
fire
appeared
as
cordial
as
if
it
were
christmas

dived
into
some
obscure
recesses
from
which
they
speedily
produced
a
bottle
of
blacking
and
some
dozen
brushes

said
the
old
gentleman
again
but
the
admonition
was
quite
unnecessary
for
one
of
the
girls
poured
out
the
cherry
brandy
and
another
brought
in
the
towels
and
one
of
the
men
suddenly
seizing
pickwick
by
the
leg
at
imminent
hazard
of
throwing
him
off
his
balance
brushed
away
at
his
boot
till
his
corns
were
while
the
other
shampooed

with
a
heavy
indulging
during
the
operation
in
that
hissing
sound
which
hostlers
are
wont
to
produce
when
engaged
in
rubbing
down
a
horse
snodgrass
having
concluded
his
ablutions
took
a
survey
of
the
room
while
standing
with
his
back
to
the
fire
sipping
his
cherry
brandy
with
heartfelt
satisfaction
he
describes
it
as
a
large
apartment
with
a
red
brick
floor
and
a
capacious
chimney
the
ceiling
garnished
with
hams
sides
of
bacon
and
ropes

the
walls
were
decorated
with
several
two
or
three
bridles
a
saddle
and
an
old
rusty
blunderbuss
with
an
inscription
below
it
intimating
that
it
was
loaded
as
it
had
been
on
the
same
authority
for
half
a
century
at
least
an
old
clock
of
solemn
and
sedate
demeanour
ticked
gravely
in
one
corner
and
a
silver
watch
of
equal
antiquity
dangled
from
one
of
the
many
hooks

ornamented
the
dresser

the
old

inquiringly

several

who
were
assembled
in

to

his
friends
upon
their
entrance
and
during
the
performance
of
the
ceremony
of
introduction
with
all
due
formalities
pickwick
had
leisure
to
observe
the
appearance
and
speculate
upon
the
characters
and
pursuits
of
the
persons
by
whom
he
was
surrounded
a
habit
in
which
he
in
common
with
many
other
great
men
delighted
to
indulge
a
very
old
lady
in

lofty

was

with

benevolent

the
clergyman
of

and
next
him
sat
his
wife
a
stout
blooming
old
lady
who
looked
as
if
she
were
well
skilled
not
only
in
the
art
and
mystery
of
manufacturing
cordials
greatly
to

people

occasionally
very
much
to

a

was
conversing
with
a

old
gentleman
in

two

gentlemen
and
two

three
more
old

sat
bolt
upright
and
motionless
on

chairs
staring
very
hard
at

his
mr

at

pickwick
grasping
the

imparted
a
crimson

to

benevolent
countenance

nodded
his
readiness
to

the
infirmities
of

entered
into

said
the
corpulent
host
the
man
looked
dubiously
round
but
finding
himself
in
a
minority
assumed
a
compassionate
air
and
said
no
more
what
are
they
talking
about
inquired
the
old
lady
of
one
of
her
granddaughters
in
a
very
audible
voice
for
like
many
deaf
people
she
never
seemed
to
calculate
on
the
possibility
of
other
persons
hearing
what
she
said
herself
about
the
land
what
about
the
land
nothing

no
no
miller
was
saying
our
land
was
better
than
mullins

how
should

know
anything
about
it
inquired
the
old
lady
indignantly
miller
s
a
conceited
coxcomb
and
you
may
tell
him
i
said
saying
which
the
old
lady
quite
unconscious
that
she
had
spoken
above
a
whisper
drew
herself
up
and
looked
at
the
headed
delinquent
come
come
said
the
bustling
host
with
a
natural
anxiety
to
change
the
conversation
what
say
you
to
a
rubber
pickwick
i
should
like
it
of
all
things
replied
that
gentleman
but
pray
don

make
up

on
my
oh
i
assure
you
mother

very
fond
of
a

said
wardle
ain
t
you
mother

old
lady
who
was
much
less
deaf
on
this
subject
than
on
any
other
replied
in
the
affirmative
joe
joe
said
the
gentleman
joe
damn
that
oh
here

is
put
out

the
lethargic
youth
contrived
without
any
additional
rousing
to
set
out
two

one
for
pope
joan
and
the
other
for
whist
the
were
pickwick
and
the
old
lady
miller
and
the
fat
gentleman
the
round
game
comprised
the
rest
of
the
company
the
rubber
was
conducted
with
all
that
gravity
of
deportment
and
sedateness
of
demeanour
which
befit
the
pursuit
entitled
whist
a
solemn
observance
to
which
as
it
appears
to
us
the
title
of
game
has
been
very
irreverently
and
ignominiously
applied
the
table
on
the
other
hand
was
so
boisterously
merry
as
materially
to
interrupt
the
contemplations
of
miller
who
not
being
quite
so
much
absorbed
as
he
ought
to
have
been
contrived
to
commit
various
high
crimes
and
misdemeanours
which
excited
the
wrath
of
the
fat
gentleman
to
a
very
great
extent
and
called
forth
the
of
the
old
lady
in
a
proportionate
degree
there
said
the
criminal
miller
triumphantly
as
he
took
up
the
odd
trick
at
the
conclusion
of
a
hand
that
could
not
have
been
played
better
i
flatter
myself
impossible
to
have
made
another
trick
miller
ought
to
have
trumped

diamond

said
the
old
lady
pickwick
nodded
assent

the
unfortunate
with
a
doubtful
appeal
to
his
partner

said
the
fat
gentleman
in
an

pickwick

inquired
the
old
lady

replied
pickwick
double

and
the
never
was
such
luck
said
miller
never
was
such

said
the
fat
gentleman
a
solemn
silence
pickwick

the
old
lady
serious
the
fat

captious
and
miller
timorous
another

said
the
old
lady
triumphantly
making
a
memorandum
of
the
circumstance
by
placing
one
sixpence
and
a
battered
halfpenny
under
the
candlestick

pickwick
quite

of

sir
replied
the
fat
gentleman
sharply
another
game
with
a
similar
result
was
followed
by
a
revoke
from
the
unlucky
miller
on
which
the
fat
gentleman
burst
into
a
state
of
high
personal
excitement
which
lasted
until
the
conclusion
of
the
game
when
he
retired
into
a
corner
and
remained
perfectly
mute
for
one
hour
and
minutes
at
the
end
of
which
time
he
emerged
from
his
retirement
and
offered
pickwick
a
pinch
of
snuff
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
had
made
up
his
mind
to
a
christian
forgiveness
of
injuries
sustained
the
old
lady
s
hearing
decidedly
improved
and
the
unlucky
miller
felt
as
much
out
of
his
element
as
a
dolphin
in
a
meanwhile
the
round
game
proceeded
right
merrily
isabella
wardle
and
trundle
went
partners
and
emily
wardle
and
snodgrass
did
the
same
and
even
tupman
and
the
spinster
aunt
established
a
stock
company
of
fish
and
flattery
old
wardle
was
in
the
very
height
of
his
jollity
and
he
was
so
funny
in
his
management
of
the
board
and
the
old
ladies
were
so
sharp
after
their
winnings
that
the
whole
table
was
in
a
perpetual
roar
of
merriment
and
laughter
there
was
one
old
lady
who
always
had
about
half
a
dozen
cards
to
pay
for
at
which
everybody
laughed
regularly
every
round
and
when
the
old
lady
looked
cross
at
having
to
pay
they
laughed
louder
than
ever
on
which
the
old
lady
s
face
gradually
brightened
up
till
at
last
she
laughed
louder
than
any
of
them
then
when
the
spinster
aunt
got
matrimony
the
young
ladies
laughed
afresh
and
the
spinster
aunt
seemed
disposed
to
be
pettish
till
feeling
tupman
squeezing
her
hand
under
the
table
she
brightened
up
too
and
looked
rather
knowing
as
if
matrimony
in
reality
were
not
quite
so
far
off
as
some
people
thought
for
whereupon
everybody
laughed
again
and
especially
old
wardle
who
enjoyed
a
joke
as
much
as
the
youngest
as
to
snodgrass
he
did
nothing
but
whisper
poetical
sentiments
into
his
partner
s
ear
which
made
one
old
gentleman
facetiously
sly
about
partnerships
at
cards
and
partnerships
for
life
and
caused
the
aforesaid
old
gentleman
to
make
some
remarks
thereupon
accompanied
with
divers
winks
and
chuckles
which
made
the
company
very
merry
and
the
old
gentleman
s
wife
especially
so
and
winkle
came
out
with
jokes
which
are
very
well
known
in
town
but
are
not
all
known
in
the
country
and
as
everybody
laughed
at
them
very
heartily
and
said
they
were
very
capital
winkle
was
in
a
state
of
great
honour
and
glory
and
the
benevolent
clergyman
looked
pleasantly
on
for
the
happy
faces
which
surrounded
the
table
made
the
good
old
man
feel
happy
too
and
though
the
merriment
was
rather
boisterous
still
it
came
from
the
heart
and
not
from
the
lips
and
this
is
the
right
sort
of
merriment
after
all
the
evening
glided
swiftly
away
in
these
cheerful
recreations
and
when
the
substantial
though
homely
supper
had
been
despatched
and
the
little
party
formed
a
social
circle
round
the
fire
pickwick
thought
he
had
never
felt
so
happy
in
his
life
and
at
no
time
so
much
disposed
to
enjoy
and
make
the
most
of
the
passing
moment
now
this
said
the
hospitable
host
who
was
sitting
in
great
state
next
the
old
lady
s
with
her
hand
fast
clasped
in
his
this
is
just
what
i
like
the
happiest
moments
of
my
life
have
been
passed
at
this
old
fireside
and
i
am
so
attached
to
it
that
i
keep
up
a
blazing
fire
here
every
evening
until
it
actually
grows
too
hot
to
bear
it
why
my
poor
old
mother
here
used
to
sit
before
this
fireplace
upon
that
little
stool
when
she
was
a
girl
didn
t
you
mother
the
tear
which
starts
unbidden
to
the
eye
when
the
recollection
of
old
times
and
the
happiness
of
many
years
ago
is
suddenly
recalled
stole
down
the
old
lady
s
face
as
she
shook
her
head
with
a
melancholy
smile
you
must
excuse
my
talking
about
this
old
place
pickwick
resumed
the
host
after
a
short
pause
for
i
love
it
dearly
and
know
no
old
houses
and
fields
seem
like
living
friends
to
me
and
so
does
our
little
church
with
the
ivy
about
which
by
the
bye
our
excellent
friend
there
made
a
song
when
he
first
came
amongst
us
snodgrass
have
you
anything
in
your
glass
plenty
thank
you
replied
that
gentleman
whose
poetic
curiosity
had
been
greatly
excited
by
the
last
observation
of
his
entertainer
i
beg
your
pardon
but
you
were
talking
about
the
song
of
the
you
must
ask
our
friend
opposite
about
that
said
the
host
knowingly
indicating
the
clergyman
by
a
nod
of
his
head
may
i
say
that
i
should
like
to
hear
you
repeat
it
sir
said
snodgrass
why
really
replied
the
clergyman
it
s
a
very
slight
affair
and
the
only
excuse
i
have
for
having
ever
perpetrated
it
is
that
i
was
a
young
man
at
the
time
such
as
it
is
however
you
shall
hear
it
if
you
a
murmur
of
curiosity
was
of
course
the
reply
and
the
old
gentleman
proceeded
to
recite
with
the
aid
of
sundry
promptings
from
his
wife
the
lines
in
question
i
call
them
said
he
the
ivy
green
oh
a
dainty
plant
is
the
ivy
green
that
creepeth
o
er
ruins
old
of
right
choice
food
are
his
meals
i
ween
in
his
cell
so
lone
and
cold
the
wall
must
be
crumbled
the
stone
decayed
to
pleasure
his
dainty
whim
and
the
mouldering
dust
that
years
have
made
is
a
merry
meal
for
him
creeping
where
no
life
is
seen
a
rare
old
plant
is
the
ivy
green
fast
he
stealeth
on
though
he
wears
no
wings
and
a
staunch
old
heart
has
he
how
closely
he
twineth
how
tight
he
clings
to
his
friend
the
huge
oak
tree
and
slily
he
traileth
along
the
ground
and
his
leaves
he
gently
waves
as
he
joyously
hugs
and
crawleth
round
the
rich
mould
of
dead
men
s
graves
creeping
where
grim
death
has
been
a
rare
old
plant
is
the
ivy
green
whole
ages
have
fled
and
their
works
decayed
and
nations
have
scattered
been
but
the
stout
old
ivy
shall
never
fade
from
its
hale
and
hearty
green
the
brave
old
plant
in
its
lonely
days
shall
fatten
upon
the
past
for
the
stateliest
building
man
can
raise
is
the
ivy
s
food
at
last
creeping
on
where
time
has
been
a
rare
old
plant
is
the
ivy
green
while
the
old
gentleman
repeated
these
lines
a
second
time
to
enable
snodgrass
to
note
them
down
pickwick
perused
the
lineaments
of
his
face
with
an
expression
of
great
interest
the
old
gentleman
having
concluded
his
dictation
and
snodgrass
having
returned
his
to
his
pocket
pickwick
said
excuse
me
sir
for
making
the
remark
on
so
short
an
acquaintance
but
a
gentleman
like
yourself
can
not
fail
i
should
think
to
have
observed
many
scenes
and
incidents
worth
recording
in
the
course
of
your
experience
as
a
minister
of
the
i
have
witnessed
some
certainly
replied
the
old
gentleman
but
the
incidents
and
characters
have
been
of
a
homely
and
ordinary
nature
my
sphere
of
action
being
so
very
you
did
make
some
notes
i
think
about
john
edmunds
did
you
not
inquired
wardle
who
appeared
very
desirous
to
draw
his
friend
out
for
the
edification
of
his
new
visitors
the
old
gentleman
slightly
nodded
his
head
in
token
of
assent
and
was
proceeding
to
change
the
subject
when
pickwick
said
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
but
pray
if
i
may
venture
to
inquire
who
was
john
edmunds
the
very
thing
i
was
about
to
ask
said
snodgrass
eagerly
you
are
fairly
in
for
it
said
the
jolly
host
you
must
satisfy
the
curiosity
of
these
gentlemen
sooner
or
later
so
you
had
better
take
advantage
of
this
favourable
opportunity
and
do
so
at
the
old
gentleman
smiled
as
he
drew
his
chair
forward
the
remainder
of
the
party
drew
their
chairs
closer
together
especially
tupman
and
the
spinster
aunt
who
were
possibly
rather
hard
of
hearing
and
the
old
lady
s
having
been
duly
adjusted
and
miller
who
had
fallen
asleep
during
the
recital
of
the
verses
roused
from
his
slumbers
by
an
admonitory
pinch
administered
beneath
the
table
by
his
the
solemn
fat
man
the
old
gentleman
without
further
preface
commenced
the
following
tale
to
which
we
have
taken
the
liberty
of
prefixing
the
title
of
the
convict
s
return
when
i
first
settled
in
this
village
said
the
old
gentleman
which
is
now
just
years
ago
the
most
notorious
person
among
my
parishioners
was
a
man
of
the
name
of
edmunds
who
leased
a
small
farm
near
this
spot
he
was
a
morose
bad
man
idle
and
dissolute
in
his
habits
cruel
and
ferocious
in
his
disposition
beyond
the
few
lazy
and
reckless
vagabonds
with
whom
he
sauntered
away
his
time
in
the
fields
or
sotted
in
the
he
had
not
a
single
friend
or
acquaintance
no
one
cared
to
speak
to
the
man
whom
many
feared
and
every
one
detested
and
edmunds
was
shunned
by
all
this
man
had
a
wife
and
one
son
who
when
i
first
came
here
was
about
twelve
years
old
of
the
acuteness
of
that
woman
s
sufferings
of
the
gentle
and
enduring
manner
in
which
she
bore
them
of
the
agony
of
solicitude
with
which
she
reared
that
boy
no
one
can
form
an
adequate
conception
heaven
forgive
me
the
supposition
if
it
be
an
uncharitable
one
but
i
do
firmly
and
in
my
soul
believe
that
the
man
systematically
tried
for
many
years
to
break
her
heart
but
she
bore
it
all
for
her
child
s
sake
and
however
strange
it
may
seem
to
many
for
his
father
s
too
for
brute
as
he
was
and
cruelly
as
he
had
treated
her
she
had
loved
him
once
and
the
recollection
of
what
he
had
been
to
her
awakened
feelings
of
forbearance
and
meekness
under
suffering
in
her
bosom
to
which
all
god
s
creatures
but
women
are
strangers
they
were
poor
they
could
not
be
otherwise
when
the
man
pursued
such
courses
but
the
woman
s
unceasing
and
unwearied
exertions
early
and
late
morning
noon
and
night
kept
them
above
actual
want
these
exertions
were
but
ill
repaid
people
who
passed
the
spot
in
the
evening
sometimes
at
a
late
hour
of
the
night
reported
that
they
had
heard
the
moans
and
sobs
of
a
woman
in
distress
and
the
sound
of
blows
and
more
than
once
when
it
was
past
midnight
the
boy
knocked
softly
at
the
door
of
a
neighbour
s
house
whither
he
had
been
sent
to
escape
the
drunken
fury
of
his
unnatural
father
during
the
whole
of
this
time
and
when
the
poor
creature
often
bore
about
her
marks
of
and
violence
which
she
could
not
wholly
conceal
she
was
a
constant
attendant
at
our
little
church
regularly
every
sunday
morning
and
afternoon
she
occupied
the
same
seat
with
the
boy
at
her
side
and
though
they
were
both
poorly
dressed
much
more
so
than
many
of
their
neighbours
who
were
in
a
lower
station
they
were
always
neat
and
clean
every
one
had
a
friendly
nod
and
a
kind
word
for
poor
edmunds
and
sometimes
when
she
stopped
to
exchange
a
few
words
with
a
neighbour
at
the
conclusion
of
the
service
in
the
little
row
of
which
leads
to
the
church
porch
or
lingered
behind
to
gaze
with
a
mother
s
pride
and
fondness
upon
her
healthy
boy
as
he
sported
before
her
with
some
little
companions
her
careworn
face
would
lighten
up
with
an
expression
of
heartfelt
gratitude
and
she
would
look
if
not
cheerful
and
happy
at
least
tranquil
and
contented
five
or
six
years
passed
away
the
boy
had
become
a
robust
and
grown
youth
the
time
that
had
strengthened
the
child
s
slight
frame
and
knit
his
weak
limbs
into
the
strength
of
manhood
had
bowed
his
mother
s
form
and
enfeebled
her
steps
but
the
arm
that
should
have
supported
her
was
no
longer
locked
in
hers
the
face
that
should
have
cheered
her
no
more
looked
upon
her
own
she
occupied
her
old
seat
but
there
was
a
vacant
one
beside
her
the
bible
was
kept
as
carefully
as
ever
the
places
were
found
and
folded
down
as
they
used
to
be
but
there
was
no
one
to
read
it
with
her
and
the
tears
fell
thick
and
fast
upon
the
book
and
blotted
the
words
from
her
eyes
neighbours
were
as
kind
as
they
were
wont
to
be
of
old
but
she
shunned
their
greetings
with
averted
head
there
was
no
lingering
among
the
old
now
no
cheering
anticipations
of
happiness
yet
in
store
the
desolate
woman
drew
her
bonnet
closer
over
her
face
and
walked
hurriedly
away
shall
i
tell
you
that
the
young
man
who
looking
back
to
the
earliest
of
his
childhood
s
days
to
which
memory
and
consciousness
extended
and
carrying
his
recollection
down
to
that
moment
could
remember
nothing
which
was
not
in
some
way
connected
with
a
long
series
of
voluntary
privations
suffered
by
his
mother
for
his
sake
with
and
insult
and
violence
and
all
endured
for
him
shall
i
tell
you
that
he
with
a
reckless
disregard
for
her
breaking
heart
and
a
sullen
wilful
forgetfulness
of
all
she
had
done
and
borne
for
him
had
linked
himself
with
depraved
and
abandoned
men
and
was
madly
pursuing
a
headlong
career
which
must
bring
death
to
him
and
shame
to
her
alas
for
human
nature
you
have
anticipated
it
long
since
the
measure
of
the
unhappy
woman
s
misery
and
misfortune
was
about
to
be
completed
numerous
offences
had
been
committed
in
the
neighbourhood
the
perpetrators
remained
undiscovered
and
their
boldness
increased
a
robbery
of
a
daring
and
aggravated
nature
occasioned
a
vigilance
of
pursuit
and
a
strictness
of
search
they
had
not
calculated
on
young
edmunds
was
suspected
with
three
companions
he
was
apprehended
committed
tried
condemned
to
die
the
wild
and
piercing
shriek
from
a
woman
s
voice
which
resounded
through
the
court
when
the
solemn
sentence
was
pronounced
rings
in
my
ears
at
this
moment
that
cry
struck
a
terror
to
the
culprit
s
heart
which
trial
condemnation
the
approach
of
death
itself
had
failed
to
awaken
the
lips
which
had
been
compressed
in
dogged
sullenness
throughout
quivered
and
parted
involuntarily
the
face
turned
ashy
pale
as
the
cold
perspiration
broke
forth
from
every
pore
the
sturdy
limbs
of
the
felon
trembled
and
he
staggered
in
the
dock
in
the
first
transports
of
her
mental
anguish
the
suffering
mother
threw
herself
on
her
knees
at
my
feet
and
fervently
sought
the
almighty
being
who
had
hitherto
supported
her
in
all
her
troubles
to
release
her
from
a
world
of
woe
and
misery
and
to
spare
the
life
of
her
only
child
a
burst
of
grief
and
a
violent
struggle
such
as
i
hope
i
may
never
have
to
witness
again
succeeded
i
knew
that
her
heart
was
breaking
from
that
hour
but
i
never
once
heard
complaint
or
murmur
escape
her
lips
it
was
a
piteous
spectacle
to
see
that
woman
in
the
from
day
to
day
eagerly
and
fervently
attempting
by
affection
and
entreaty
to
soften
the
hard
heart
of
her
obdurate
son
it
was
in
vain
he
remained
moody
obstinate
and
unmoved
not
even
the
commutation
of
his
sentence
to
transportation
for
fourteen
years
softened
for
an
instant
the
sullen
hardihood
of
his
demeanour
but
the
spirit
of
resignation
and
endurance
that
had
so
long
upheld
her
was
unable
to
contend
against
bodily
weakness
and
infirmity
she
fell
sick
she
dragged
her
tottering
limbs
from
the
bed
to
visit
her
son
once
more
but
her
strength
failed
her
and
she
sank
powerless
on
the
ground
and
now
the
boasted
coldness
and
indifference
of
the
young
man
were
tested
indeed
and
the
retribution
that
fell
heavily
upon
him
nearly
drove
him
mad
a
day
passed
away
and
his
mother
was
not
there
another
flew
by
and
she
came
not
near
him
a
third
evening
arrived
and
yet
he
had
not
seen
her
and
in
hours
he
was
to
be
separated
from
her
perhaps
for
ever
oh
how
the
thoughts
of
former
days
rushed
upon
his
mind
as
he
almost
ran
up
and
down
the
narrow
yard
as
if
intelligence
would
arrive
the
sooner
for
his
hurrying
and
how
bitterly
a
sense
of
his
helplessness
and
desolation
rushed
upon
him
when
he
heard
the
truth
his
mother
the
only
parent
he
had
ever
known
lay
ill
it
might
be
dying
within
one
mile
of
the
ground
he
stood
on
were
he
free
and
unfettered
a
few
minutes
would
place
him
by
her
side
he
rushed
to
the
gate
and
grasping
the
iron
rails
with
the
energy
of
desperation
shook
it
till
it
rang
again
and
threw
himself
against
the
thick
wall
as
if
to
force
a
passage
through
the
stone
but
the
strong
building
mocked
his
feeble
efforts
and
he
beat
his
hands
together
and
wept
like
a
child
i
bore
the
mother
s
forgiveness
and
blessing
to
her
son
in
prison
and
i
carried
the
solemn
assurance
of
repentance
and
his
fervent
supplication
for
pardon
to
her
i
heard
with
pity
and
compassion
the
repentant
man
devise
a
thousand
little
plans
for
her
comfort
and
support
when
he
returned
but
i
knew
that
many
months
before
he
could
reach
his
place
of
destination
his
mother
would
be
no
longer
of
this
world
he
was
removed
by
night
a
few
weeks
afterwards
the
poor
woman
s
soul
took
its
flight
i
confidently
hope
and
solemnly
believe
to
a
place
of
eternal
happiness
and
rest
i
performed
the
burial
service
over
her
remains
she
lies
in
our
little
churchyard
there
is
no
stone
at
her
grave
s
head
her
sorrows
were
known
to
man
her
virtues
to
god
it
had
been
arranged
previously
to
the
convict
s
departure
that
he
should
write
to
his
mother
as
soon
as
he
could
obtain
permission
and
that
the
letter
should
be
addressed
to
me
the
father
had
positively
refused
to
see
his
son
from
the
moment
of
his
apprehension
and
it
was
a
matter
of
indifference
to
him
whether
he
lived
or
died
many
years
passed
over
without
any
intelligence
of
him
and
when
more
than
half
his
term
of
transportation
had
expired
and
i
had
received
no
letter
i
concluded
him
to
be
dead
as
indeed
i
almost
hoped
he
might
be
edmunds
however
had
been
sent
a
considerable
distance
up
the
country
on
his
arrival
at
the
settlement
and
to
this
circumstance
perhaps
may
be
attributed
the
fact
that
though
several
letters
were
despatched
none
of
them
ever
reached
my
hands
he
remained
in
the
same
place
during
the
whole
fourteen
years
at
the
expiration
of
the
term
steadily
adhering
to
his
old
resolution
and
the
pledge
he
gave
his
mother
he
made
his
way
back
to
england
amidst
innumerable
difficulties
and
returned
on
foot
to
his
native
place
on
a
fine
sunday
evening
in
the
month
of
august
john
edmunds
set
foot
in
the
village
he
had
left
with
shame
and
disgrace
seventeen
years
before
his
nearest
way
lay
through
the
churchyard
the
man
s
heart
swelled
as
he
crossed
the
stile
the
tall
old
elms
through
whose
branches
the
declining
sun
cast
here
and
there
a
rich
ray
of
light
upon
the
shady
part
awakened
the
associations
of
his
earliest
days
he
pictured
himself
as
he
was
then
clinging
to
his
mother
s
hand
and
walking
peacefully
to
church
he
remembered
how
he
used
to
look
up
into
her
pale
face
and
how
her
eyes
would
sometimes
fill
with
tears
as
she
gazed
upon
his
features
tears
which
fell
hot
upon
his
forehead
as
she
stooped
to
kiss
him
and
made
him
weep
too
although
he
little
knew
then
what
bitter
tears
hers
were
he
thought
how
often
he
had
run
merrily
down
that
path
with
some
childish
playfellow
looking
back
ever
and
again
to
catch
his
mother
s
smile
or
hear
her
gentle
voice
and
then
a
veil
seemed
lifted
from
his
memory
and
words
of
kindness
unrequited
and
warnings
despised
and
promises
broken
thronged
upon
his
recollection
till
his
heart
failed
him
and
he
could
bear
it
no
longer
he
entered
the
church
the
evening
service
was
concluded
and
the
congregation
had
dispersed
but
it
was
not
yet
closed
his
steps
echoed
through
the
low
building
with
a
hollow
sound
and
he
almost
feared
to
be
alone
it
was
so
still
and
quiet
he
looked
round
him
nothing
was
changed
the
place
seemed
smaller
than
it
used
to
be
but
there
were
the
old
monuments
on
which
he
had
gazed
with
childish
awe
a
thousand
times
the
little
pulpit
with
its
faded
cushion
the
communion
table
before
which
he
had
so
often
repeated
the
commandments
he
had
reverenced
as
a
child
and
forgotten
as
a
man
he
approached
the
old
seat
it
looked
cold
and
desolate
the
cushion
had
been
removed
and
the
bible
was
not
there
perhaps
his
mother
now
occupied
a
poorer
seat
or
possibly
she
had
grown
infirm
and
could
not
reach
the
church
alone
he
dared
not
think
of
what
he
feared
a
cold
feeling
crept
over
him
and
he
trembled
violently
as
he
turned
away
an
old
man
entered
the
porch
just
as
he
reached
it
edmunds
started
back
for
he
knew
him
well
many
a
time
he
had
watched
him
digging
graves
in
the
churchyard
what
would
he
say
to
the
returned
convict
the
old
man
raised
his
eyes
to
the
stranger
s
face
bade
him
evening
and
walked
slowly
on
he
had
forgotten
him
he
walked
down
the
hill
and
through
the
village
the
weather
was
warm
and
the
people
were
sitting
at
their
doors
or
strolling
in
their
little
gardens
as
he
passed
enjoying
the
serenity
of
the
evening
and
their
rest
from
labour
many
a
look
was
turned
towards
him
and
many
a
doubtful
glance
he
cast
on
either
side
to
see
whether
any
knew
and
shunned
him
there
were
strange
faces
in
almost
every
house
in
some
he
recognised
the
burly
form
of
some
old
schoolfellow
a
boy
when
he
last
saw
him
surrounded
by
a
troop
of
merry
children
in
others
he
saw
seated
in
an
at
a
cottage
door
a
feeble
and
infirm
old
man
whom
he
only
remembered
as
a
hale
and
hearty
labourer
but
they
had
all
forgotten
him
and
he
passed
on
unknown
the
last
soft
light
of
the
setting
sun
had
fallen
on
the
earth
casting
a
rich
glow
on
the
yellow
corn
sheaves
and
lengthening
the
shadows
of
the
orchard
trees
as
he
stood
before
the
old
house
the
home
of
his
infancy
to
which
his
heart
had
yearned
with
an
intensity
of
affection
not
to
be
described
through
long
and
weary
years
of
captivity
and
sorrow
the
paling
was
low
though
he
well
remembered
the
time
that
it
had
seemed
a
high
wall
to
him
and
he
looked
over
into
the
old
garden
there
were
more
seeds
and
gayer
flowers
than
there
used
to
be
but
there
were
the
old
trees
still
the
very
tree
under
which
he
had
lain
a
thousand
times
when
tired
of
playing
in
the
sun
and
felt
the
soft
mild
sleep
of
happy
boyhood
steal
gently
upon
him
there
were
voices
within
the
house
he
listened
but
they
fell
strangely
upon
his
ear
he
knew
them
not
they
were
merry
too
and
he
well
knew
that
his
poor
old
mother
could
not
be
cheerful
and
he
away
the
door
opened
and
a
group
of
little
children
bounded
out
shouting
and
romping
the
father
with
a
little
boy
in
his
arms
appeared
at
the
door
and
they
crowded
round
him
clapping
their
tiny
hands
and
dragging
him
out
to
join
their
joyous
sports
the
convict
thought
on
the
many
times
he
had
shrunk
from
his
father
s
sight
in
that
very
place
he
remembered
how
often
he
had
buried
his
trembling
head
beneath
the
bedclothes
and
heard
the
harsh
word
and
the
hard
stripe
and
his
mother
s
wailing
and
though
the
man
sobbed
aloud
with
agony
of
mind
as
he
left
the
spot
his
fist
was
clenched
and
his
teeth
were
set
in
a
fierce
and
deadly
passion
and
such
was
the
return
to
which
he
had
looked
through
the
weary
perspective
of
many
years
and
for
which
he
had
undergone
so
much
suffering
no
face
of
welcome
no
look
of
forgiveness
no
house
to
receive
no
hand
to
help
him
and
this
too
in
the
old
village
what
was
his
loneliness
in
the
wild
thick
woods
where
man
was
never
seen
to
this
he
felt
that
in
the
distant
land
of
his
bondage
and
infamy
he
had
thought
of
his
native
place
as
it
was
when
he
left
it
and
not
as
it
would
be
when
he
returned
the
sad
reality
struck
coldly
at
his
heart
and
his
spirit
sank
within
him
he
had
not
courage
to
make
inquiries
or
to
present
himself
to
the
only
person
who
was
likely
to
receive
him
with
kindness
and
compassion
he
walked
slowly
on
and
shunning
the
roadside
like
a
guilty
man
turned
into
a
meadow
he
well
remembered
and
covering
his
face
with
his
hands
threw
himself
upon
the
grass
he
had
not
observed
that
a
man
was
lying
on
the
bank
beside
him
his
garments
rustled
as
he
turned
round
to
steal
a
look
at
the
and
edmunds
raised
his
head
the
man
had
moved
into
a
sitting
posture
his
body
was
much
bent
and
his
face
was
wrinkled
and
yellow
his
dress
denoted
him
an
inmate
of
the
workhouse
he
had
the
appearance
of
being
very
old
but
it
looked
more
the
effect
of
dissipation
or
disease
than
the
length
of
years
he
was
staring
hard
at
the
stranger
and
though
his
eyes
were
lustreless
and
heavy
at
first
they
appeared
to
glow
with
an
unnatural
and
alarmed
expression
after
they
had
been
fixed
upon
him
for
a
short
time
until
they
seemed
to
be
starting
from
their
sockets
edmunds
gradually
raised
himself
to
his
knees
and
looked
more
and
more
earnestly
on
the
old
man
s
face
they
gazed
upon
each
other
in
silence
the
old
man
was
ghastly
pale
he
shuddered
and
tottered
to
his
feet
edmunds
sprang
to
his
he
stepped
back
a
pace
or
two
edmunds
advanced
let
me
hear
you
speak
said
the
convict
in
a
thick
broken
voice
stand
off
cried
the
old
man
with
a
dreadful
oath
the
convict
drew
closer
to
him
stand
off
shrieked
the
old
man
furious
with
terror
he
raised
his
stick
and
struck
edmunds
a
heavy
blow
across
the
face
father
devil
murmured
the
convict
between
his
set
teeth
he
rushed
wildly
forward
and
clenched
the
old
man
by
the
throat
but
he
was
his
father
and
his
arm
fell
powerless
by
his
side
the
old
man
uttered
a
loud
yell
which
rang
through
the
lonely
fields
like
the
howl
of
an
evil
spirit
his
face
turned
black
the
gore
rushed
from
his
mouth
and
nose
and
dyed
the
grass
a
deep
dark
red
as
he
staggered
and
fell
he
had
ruptured
a
and
he
was
a
dead
man
before
his
son
could
raise
him
in
that
corner
of
the
churchyard
said
the
old
gentleman
after
a
silence
of
a
few
moments
in
that
corner
of
the
churchyard
of
which
i
have
before
spoken
there
lies
buried
a
man
who
was
in
my
employment
for
three
years
after
this
event
and
who
was
truly
contrite
penitent
and
humbled
if
ever
man
was
no
one
save
myself
knew
in
that
man
s
lifetime
who
he
was
or
whence
he
came
it
was
john
edmunds
the
returned
chapter
vii
how
winkle
instead
of
shooting
at
the
pigeon
and
killing
the
crow
shot
at
the
crow
and
wounded
the
pigeon
how
the
dingley
dell
cricket
club
played
and
how
dined
at
the
dingley
dell
expense
with
other
interesting
and
instructive
matters
the
fatiguing
adventures
of
the
day
or
the
somniferous
influence
of
the
clergyman
s
tale
operated
so
strongly
on
the
drowsy
tendencies
of
pickwick
that
in
less
than
five
minutes
after
he
had
been
shown
to
his
comfortable
bedroom
he
fell
into
a
sound
and
dreamless
sleep
from
which
he
was
only
awakened
by
the
morning
sun
darting
his
bright
beams
reproachfully
into
the
apartment
pickwick
was
no
sluggard
and
he
sprang
like
an
ardent
warrior
from
his
pleasant
pleasant
country
sighed
the
enthusiastic
gentleman
as
he
opened
his
lattice
window
who
could
live
to
gaze
from
day
to
day
on
bricks
and
slates
who
had
once
felt
the
influence
of
a
scene
like
this
who
could
continue
to
exist
where
there
are
no
cows
but
the
cows
on
the
nothing
redolent
of
pan
but
no
crop
but
stone
crop
who
could
bear
to
drag
out
a
life
in
such
a
spot
who
i
ask
could
endure
it
and
having
solitude
after
the
most
approved
precedents
at
considerable
length
pickwick
thrust
his
head
out
of
the
lattice
and
looked
around
him
the
rich
sweet
smell
of
the
rose
to
his
chamber
window
the
hundred
perfumes
of
the
little
beneath
scented
the
air
around
the
meadows
shone
in
the
morning
dew
that
glistened
on
every
leaf
as
it
trembled
in
the
gentle
air
and
the
birds
sang
as
if
every
sparkling
drop
were
to
them
a
fountain
of
inspiration
pickwick
fell
into
an
enchanting
and
delicious
reverie
hollo
was
the
sound
that
roused
him
he
looked
to
the
right
but
he
saw
nobody
his
eyes
wandered
to
the
left
and
pierced
the
prospect
he
stared
into
the
sky
but
he
wasn
t
wanted
there
and
then
he
did
what
a
common
mind
would
have
done
at
once
looked
into
the
garden
and
there
saw
wardle
how
are
you
said
the
individual
out
of
breath
with
his
own
anticipations
of
beautiful
morning
ain
t
it
glad
to
see
you
up
so
early
make
haste
down
and
come
out
i
ll
wait
for
you
pickwick
needed
no
second
invitation
ten
minutes
sufficed
for
the
completion
of
his
toilet
and
at
the
expiration
of
that
time
he
was
by
the
old
gentleman
s
side
hollo
said
pickwick
in
his
turn
seeing
that
his
companion
was
armed
with
a
gun
and
that
another
lay
ready
on
the
grass
what
s
going
forward
why
your
friend
and
i
replied
the
host
are
going
out
before
breakfast
he
s
a
very
good
shot
ain
t
he
i
ve
heard
him
say
he
s
a
capital
one
replied
pickwick
but
i
never
saw
him
aim
at
well
said
the
host
i
wish
he
d
come
joe
joe
the
fat
boy
who
under
the
exciting
influence
of
the
morning
did
not
appear
to
be
more
than
three
parts
and
a
fraction
asleep
emerged
from
the
house
go
up
and
call
the
gentleman
and
tell
him
he
ll
find
me
and
pickwick
in
the
rookery
show
the
gentleman
the
way
there
d
ye
hear
the
boy
departed
to
execute
his
commission
and
the
host
carrying
both
guns
like
a
second
robinson
crusoe
led
the
way
from
the
garden
this
is
the
place
said
the
old
gentleman
pausing
after
a
few
minutes
walking
in
an
avenue
of
trees
the
information
was
unnecessary
for
the
incessant
cawing
of
the
unconscious
rooks
sufficiently
indicated
their
whereabouts
the
old
gentleman
laid
one
gun
on
the
ground
and
loaded
the
other
here
they
are
said
pickwick
and
as
he
spoke
the
forms
of
tupman
snodgrass
and
winkle
appeared
in
the
distance
the
fat
boy
not
being
quite
certain
which
gentleman
he
was
directed
to
call
had
with
peculiar
sagacity
and
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
any
mistake
called
them
all
come
along
shouted
the
old
gentleman
addressing
winkle
a
keen
hand
like
you
ought
to
have
been
up
long
ago
even
to
such
poor
work
as
winkle
responded
with
a
forced
smile
and
took
up
the
spare
gun
with
an
expression
of
countenance
which
a
metaphysical
rook
impressed
with
a
foreboding
of
his
approaching
death
by
violence
may
be
supposed
to
assume
it
might
have
been
keenness
but
it
looked
remarkably
like
misery
the
old
gentleman
nodded
and
two
ragged
boys
who
had
been
marshalled
to
the
spot
under
the
direction
of
the
infant
lambert
forthwith
commenced
climbing
up
two
of
the
trees
what
are
these
lads
for
inquired
pickwick
abruptly
he
was
rather
alarmed
for
he
was
not
quite
certain
but
that
the
distress
of
the
agricultural
interest
about
which
he
had
often
heard
a
great
deal
might
have
compelled
the
small
boys
attached
to
the
soil
to
earn
a
precarious
and
hazardous
subsistence
by
making
marks
of
themselves
for
inexperienced
sportsmen
only
to
start
the
game
replied
wardle
laughing
to
what
inquired
pickwick
why
in
plain
english
to
frighten
the
oh
is
that
all
you
are
satisfied
very
well
shall
i
begin
if
you
please
said
winkle
glad
of
any
respite
stand
aside
then
now
for
the
boy
shouted
and
shook
a
branch
with
a
nest
on
it
half
a
dozen
young
rooks
in
violent
conversation
flew
out
to
ask
what
the
matter
was
the
old
gentleman
fired
by
way
of
reply
down
fell
one
bird
and
off
flew
the
others
take
him
up
joe
said
the
old
gentleman
there
was
a
smile
upon
the
youth
s
face
as
he
advanced
indistinct
visions
of
floated
through
his
imagination
he
laughed
as
he
retired
with
the
bird
it
was
a
plump
one
now
winkle
said
the
host
reloading
his
own
gun
fire
winkle
advanced
and
levelled
his
gun
pickwick
and
his
friends
cowered
involuntarily
to
escape
damage
from
the
heavy
fall
of
rooks
which
they
felt
quite
certain
would
be
occasioned
by
the
devastating
barrel
of
their
friend
there
was
a
solemn
pause
a
shout
a
flapping
of
wings
a
faint
click
hollo
said
the
old
gentleman
won
t
it
go
inquired
pickwick
missed
fire
said
winkle
who
was
very
pale
probably
from
disappointment
odd
said
the
old
gentleman
taking
the
gun
never
knew
one
of
them
miss
fire
before
why
i
don
t
see
anything
of
the
bless
my
soul
said
winkle
i
declare
i
forgot
the
cap
the
slight
omission
was
rectified
pickwick
crouched
again
winkle
stepped
forward
with
an
air
of
determination
and
resolution
and
tupman
looked
out
from
behind
a
tree
the
boy
shouted
four
birds
flew
out
winkle
fired
there
was
a
scream
as
of
an
individual
not
a
rook
in
corporal
anguish
tupman
had
saved
the
lives
of
innumerable
unoffending
birds
by
receiving
a
portion
of
the
charge
in
his
left
arm
to
describe
the
confusion
that
ensued
would
be
impossible
to
tell
how
pickwick
in
the
first
transports
of
emotion
called
winkle
wretch
how
tupman
lay
prostrate
on
the
ground
and
how
winkle
knelt
beside
him
how
tupman
called
distractedly
upon
some
feminine
christian
name
and
then
opened
first
one
eye
and
then
the
other
and
then
fell
back
and
shut
them
both
all
this
would
be
as
difficult
to
describe
in
detail
as
it
would
be
to
depict
the
gradual
recovering
of
the
unfortunate
individual
the
binding
up
of
his
arm
with
and
the
conveying
him
back
by
slow
degrees
supported
by
the
arms
of
his
anxious
friends
they
drew
near
the
house
the
ladies
were
at
the
garden
gate
waiting
for
their
arrival
and
their
breakfast
the
spinster
aunt
appeared
she
smiled
and
beckoned
them
to
walk
quicker
twas
evident
she
knew
not
of
the
disaster
poor
thing
there
are
times
when
ignorance
is
bliss
indeed
they
approached
nearer
why
what
is
the
matter
with
the
little
old
gentleman
said
isabella
wardle
the
spinster
aunt
heeded
not
the
remark
she
thought
it
applied
to
pickwick
in
her
eyes
tracy
tupman
was
a
youth
she
viewed
his
years
through
a
diminishing
glass
don
t
be
frightened
called
out
the
old
host
fearful
of
alarming
his
daughters
the
little
party
had
crowded
so
completely
round
tupman
that
they
could
not
yet
clearly
discern
the
nature
of
the
accident
don
t
be
frightened
said
the
host
what
s
the
matter
screamed
the
ladies
mr
tupman
has
met
with
a
little
accident
that
s
the
spinster
aunt
uttered
a
piercing
scream
burst
into
an
hysteric
laugh
and
fell
backwards
in
the
arms
of
her
nieces
throw
some
cold
water
over
her
said
the
old
gentleman
no
no
murmured
the
spinster
aunt
i
am
better
now
bella
emily
a
surgeon
is
he
wounded
is
he
dead

he
ha
ha
ha
here
the
spinster
aunt
burst
into
fit
number
two
of
hysteric
laughter
interspersed
with
screams
calm
yourself
said
tupman
affected
almost
to
tears
by
this
expression
of
sympathy
with
his
sufferings
dear
dear
madam
calm
it
is
his
voice
exclaimed
the
spinster
aunt
and
strong
symptoms
of
fit
number
three
developed
themselves
forthwith
do
not
agitate
yourself
i
entreat
you
dearest
madam
said
tupman
soothingly
i
am
very
little
hurt
i
assure
then
you
are
not
dead
ejaculated
the
hysterical
lady
oh
say
you
are
not
dead
don
t
be
a
fool
rachael
interposed
wardle
rather
more
roughly
than
was
consistent
with
the
poetic
nature
of
the
scene
what
the
devil
s
the
use
of
his
saying
he
isn
t
dead
no
no
i
am
not
said
tupman
i
require
no
assistance
but
yours
let
me
lean
on
your
he
added
in
a
whisper
oh
miss
rachael
the
agitated
female
advanced
and
offered
her
arm
they
turned
into
the
breakfast
parlour
tracy
tupman
gently
pressed
her
hand
to
his
lips
and
sank
upon
the
sofa
are
you
faint
inquired
the
anxious
rachael
no
said
tupman
it
is
nothing
i
shall
be
better
he
closed
his
eyes
he
sleeps
murmured
the
spinster
aunt
his
organs
of
vision
had
been
closed
nearly
twenty
seconds
dear
dear
tupman
tupman
jumped
up
oh
say
those
words
again
he
exclaimed
the
lady
started
surely
you
did
not
hear
them
she
said
bashfully
oh
yes
i
did
replied
tupman
repeat
them
if
you
would
have
me
recover
repeat
hush
said
the
lady
my
tracy
tupman
resumed
his
former
position
and
wardle
accompanied
by
a
surgeon
entered
the
room
the
arm
was
examined
the
wound
dressed
and
pronounced
to
be
a
very
slight
one
and
the
minds
of
the
company
having
been
thus
satisfied
they
proceeded
to
satisfy
their
appetites
with
countenances
to
which
an
expression
of
cheerfulness
was
again
restored
pickwick
alone
was
silent
and
reserved
doubt
and
distrust
were
exhibited
in
his
countenance
his
confidence
in
winkle
had
been
shaken
greatly
shaken
by
the
proceedings
of
the
morning
are
you
a
cricketer
inquired
wardle
of
the
marksman
at
any
other
time
winkle
would
have
replied
in
the
affirmative
he
felt
the
delicacy
of
his
situation
and
modestly
replied
are
you
sir
inquired
snodgrass
i
was
once
upon
a
time
replied
the
host
but
i
have
given
it
up
now
i
subscribe
to
the
club
here
but
i
don
t
the
grand
match
is
played
i
believe
said
pickwick
it
is
replied
the
host
of
course
you
would
like
to
see
i
sir
replied
pickwick
am
delighted
to
view
any
sports
which
may
be
safely
indulged
in
and
in
which
the
impotent
effects
of
unskilful
people
do
not
endanger
human
pickwick
paused
and
looked
steadily
on
winkle
who
quailed
beneath
his
leader
s
searching
glance
the
great
man
withdrew
his
eyes
after
a
few
minutes
and
added
shall
we
be
justified
in
leaving
our
wounded
friend
to
the
care
of
the
ladies
you
can
not
leave
me
in
better
hands
said
tupman
quite
impossible
said
snodgrass
it
was
therefore
settled
that
tupman
should
be
left
at
home
in
charge
of
the
females
and
that
the
remainder
of
the
guests
under
the
guidance
of
wardle
should
proceed
to
the
spot
where
was
to
be
held
that
trial
of
skill
which
had
roused
all
muggleton
from
its
torpor
and
inoculated
dingley
dell
with
a
fever
of
excitement
as
their
walk
which
was
not
above
two
miles
long
lay
through
shady
lanes
and
sequestered
footpaths
and
as
their
conversation
turned
upon
the
delightful
scenery
by
which
they
were
on
every
side
surrounded
pickwick
was
almost
inclined
to
regret
the
expedition
they
had
used
when
he
found
himself
in
the
main
street
of
the
town
of
muggleton
everybody
whose
genius
has
a
topographical
bent
knows
perfectly
well
that
muggleton
is
a
corporate
town
with
a
mayor
burgesses
and
freemen
and
anybody
who
has
consulted
the
addresses
of
the
mayor
to
the
freemen
or
the
freemen
to
the
mayor
or
both
to
the
corporation
or
all
three
to
parliament
will
learn
from
thence
what
they
ought
to
have
known
before
that
muggleton
is
an
ancient
and
loyal
borough
mingling
a
zealous
advocacy
of
christian
principles
with
a
devoted
attachment
to
commercial
rights
in
demonstration
whereof
the
mayor
corporation
and
other
inhabitants
have
presented
at
divers
times
no
fewer
than
one
thousand
four
hundred
and
twenty
petitions
against
the
continuance
of
negro
slavery
abroad
and
an
equal
number
against
any
interference
with
the
factory
system
at
home
in
favour
of
the
sale
of
livings
in
the
church
and
for
abolishing
sunday
trading
in
the
street
pickwick
stood
in
the
principal
street
of
this
illustrious
town
and
gazed
with
an
air
of
curiosity
not
unmixed
with
interest
on
the
objects
around
him
there
was
an
open
square
for
the
and
in
the
centre
of
it
a
large
inn
with
a
in
front
displaying
an
object
very
common
in
art
but
rarely
met
with
in
nature
to
wit
a
blue
lion
with
three
bow
legs
in
the
air
balancing
himself
on
the
extreme
point
of
the
centre
claw
of
his
fourth
foot
there
were
within
sight
an
auctioneer
s
and
office
a
s
a
draper
s
a
saddler
s
a
distiller
s
a
grocer
s
and
a
the
warehouse
being
also
appropriated
to
the
diffusion
of
hats
bonnets
wearing
apparel
cotton
umbrellas
and
useful
knowledge
there
was
a
red
brick
house
with
a
small
paved
courtyard
in
front
which
anybody
might
have
known
belonged
to
the
attorney
and
there
was
moreover
another
red
brick
house
with
venetian
blinds
and
a
large
brass
with
a
very
legible
announcement
that
it
belonged
to
the
surgeon
a
few
boys
were
making
their
way
to
the
and
two
or
three
shopkeepers
who
were
standing
at
their
doors
looked
as
if
they
should
like
to
be
making
their
way
to
the
same
spot
as
indeed
to
all
appearance
they
might
have
done
without
losing
any
great
amount
of
custom
thereby
pickwick
having
paused
to
make
these
observations
to
be
noted
down
at
a
more
convenient
period
hastened
to
rejoin
his
friends
who
had
turned
out
of
the
main
street
and
were
already
within
sight
of
the
field
of
battle
the
wickets
were
pitched
and
so
were
a
couple
of
marquees
for
the
rest
and
refreshment
of
the
contending
parties
the
game
had
not
yet
commenced
two
or
three
dingley
dellers
and
were
amusing
themselves
with
a
majestic
air
by
throwing
the
ball
carelessly
from
hand
to
hand
and
several
other
gentlemen
dressed
like
them
in
straw
hats
flannel
jackets
and
white
trousers
a
costume
in
which
they
looked
very
much
like
amateur
were
sprinkled
about
the
tents
towards
one
of
which
wardle
conducted
the
party
several
dozen
of
s
hailed
the
old
gentleman
s
arrival
and
a
general
raising
of
the
straw
hats
and
bending
forward
of
the
flannel
jackets
followed
his
introduction
of
his
guests
as
gentlemen
from
london
who
were
extremely
anxious
to
witness
the
proceedings
of
the
day
with
which
he
had
no
doubt
they
would
be
greatly
delighted
you
had
better
step
into
the
marquee
i
think
sir
said
one
very
stout
gentleman
whose
body
and
legs
looked
like
half
a
gigantic
roll
of
flannel
elevated
on
a
couple
of
inflated
you
ll
find
it
much
pleasanter
sir
urged
another
stout
gentleman
who
strongly
resembled
the
other
half
of
the
roll
of
flannel
aforesaid
you
re
very
good
said
pickwick
this
way
said
the
first
speaker
they
notch
in
here
it
s
the
best
place
in
the
whole
field
and
the
cricketer
panting
on
before
preceded
them
to
the
tent
capital
game
smart
sport
fine
exercise
very
were
the
words
which
fell
upon
pickwick
s
ear
as
he
entered
the
tent
and
the
first
object
that
met
his
eyes
was
his
friend
of
the
rochester
coach
holding
forth
to
the
no
small
delight
and
edification
of
a
select
circle
of
the
chosen
of
his
dress
was
slightly
improved
and
he
wore
boots
but
there
was
no
mistaking
him
the
stranger
recognised
his
friends
immediately
and
darting
forward
and
seizing
pickwick
by
the
hand
dragged
him
to
a
seat
with
his
usual
impetuosity
talking
all
the
while
as
if
the
whole
of
the
arrangements
were
under
his
especial
patronage
and
direction
this
way
this
way
capital
fun
lots
of
beer
hogsheads
rounds
of
beef
bullocks
mustard
glorious
day
down
with
you
make
yourself
at
home
glad
to
see
you
pickwick
sat
down
as
he
was
bid
and
winkle
and
snodgrass
also
complied
with
the
directions
of
their
mysterious
friend
wardle
looked
on
in
silent
wonder
mr
wardle
a
friend
of
mine
said
pickwick
friend
of
yours
my
dear
sir
how
are
you
friend
of
my
friend
s
give
me
your
hand
sir
and
the
stranger
grasped
wardle
s
hand
with
all
the
fervour
of
a
close
intimacy
of
many
years
and
then
stepped
back
a
pace
or
two
as
if
to
take
a
full
survey
of
his
face
and
figure
and
then
shook
hands
with
him
again
if
possible
more
warmly
than
before
well
and
how
came
you
here
said
pickwick
with
a
smile
in
which
benevolence
struggled
with
surprise
come
replied
the
stranger
stopping
at
crown
crown
at
muggleton
met
a
party
flannel
jackets
white
trousers
anchovy
sandwiches
devilled
kidney
splendid
fellows
pickwick
was
sufficiently
versed
in
the
stranger
s
system
of
stenography
to
infer
from
this
rapid
and
disjointed
communication
that
he
had
somehow
or
other
contracted
an
acquaintance
with
the
muggletons
which
he
had
converted
by
a
process
peculiar
to
himself
into
that
extent
of
on
which
a
general
invitation
may
be
easily
founded
his
curiosity
was
therefore
satisfied
and
putting
on
his
spectacles
he
prepared
himself
to
watch
the
play
which
was
just
commencing
had
the
first
innings
and
the
interest
became
intense
when
dumkins
and
podder
two
of
the
most
renowned
members
of
that
most
distinguished
club
walked
bat
in
hand
to
their
respective
wickets
luffey
the
highest
ornament
of
dingley
dell
was
pitched
to
bowl
against
the
redoubtable
dumkins
and
mr
struggles
was
selected
to
do
the
same
kind
office
for
the
hitherto
unconquered
podder
several
players
were
stationed
to
look
out
in
different
parts
of
the
field
and
each
fixed
himself
into
the
proper
attitude
by
placing
one
hand
on
each
knee
and
stooping
very
much
as
if
he
were
making
a
back
for
some
beginner
at
all
the
regular
players
do
this
sort
of
thing
indeed
it
is
generally
supposed
that
it
is
quite
impossible
to
look
out
properly
in
any
other
position
the
umpires
were
stationed
behind
the
wickets
the
scorers
were
prepared
to
notch
the
runs
a
breathless
silence
ensued
luffey
retired
a
few
paces
behind
the
wicket
of
the
passive
podder
and
applied
the
ball
to
his
right
eye
for
several
seconds
dumkins
confidently
awaited
its
coming
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
motions
of
luffey
play
suddenly
cried
the
bowler
the
ball
flew
from
his
hand
straight
and
swift
towards
the
centre
stump
of
the
wicket
the
wary
dumkins
was
on
the
alert
it
fell
upon
the
tip
of
the
bat
and
bounded
far
away
over
the
heads
of
the
scouts
who
had
just
stooped
low
enough
to
let
it
fly
over
them
run
run
now
then
throw
her
up
up
with
her
stop
there
another
no
yes
no
throw
her
up
throw
her
up
such
were
the
shouts
which
followed
the
stroke
and
at
the
conclusion
of
which
had
scored
two
nor
was
podder
behindhand
in
earning
laurels
wherewith
to
garnish
himself
and
muggleton
he
blocked
the
doubtful
balls
missed
the
bad
ones
took
the
good
ones
and
sent
them
flying
to
all
parts
of
the
field
the
scouts
were
hot
and
tired
the
bowlers
were
changed
and
bowled
till
their
arms
ached
but
dumkins
and
podder
remained
unconquered
did
an
elderly
gentleman
essay
to
stop
the
progress
of
the
ball
it
rolled
between
his
legs
or
slipped
between
his
fingers
did
a
slim
gentleman
try
to
catch
it
it
struck
him
on
the
nose
and
bounded
pleasantly
off
with
redoubled
violence
while
the
slim
gentleman
s
eyes
filled
with
water
and
his
form
writhed
with
anguish
was
it
thrown
straight
up
to
the
wicket
dumkins
had
reached
it
before
the
ball
in
short
when
dumkins
was
caught
out
and
podder
stumped
out
muggleton
had
notched
some
while
the
score
of
the
dingley
dellers
was
as
blank
as
their
faces
the
advantage
was
too
great
to
be
recovered
in
vain
did
the
eager
luffey
and
the
enthusiastic
struggles
do
all
that
skill
and
experience
could
suggest
to
regain
the
ground
dingley
dell
had
lost
in
the
contest
it
was
of
no
avail
and
in
an
early
period
of
the
winning
game
dingley
dell
gave
in
and
allowed
the
superior
prowess
of
the
stranger
meanwhile
had
been
eating
drinking
and
talking
without
cessation
at
every
good
stroke
he
expressed
his
satisfaction
and
approval
of
the
player
in
a
most
condescending
and
patronising
manner
which
could
not
fail
to
have
been
highly
gratifying
to
the
party
concerned
while
at
every
bad
attempt
at
a
catch
and
every
failure
to
stop
the
ball
he
launched
his
personal
displeasure
at
the
head
of
the
devoted
individual
in
such
denunciations
as
ah
ah
stupid
now
muff
humbug
and
so
forth
ejaculations
which
seemed
to
establish
him
in
the
opinion
of
all
around
as
a
most
excellent
and
undeniable
judge
of
the
whole
art
and
mystery
of
the
noble
game
of
cricket
capital
game
well
played
some
strokes

said
the
stranger
as
both
sides
crowded
into
the
tent
at
the

of
the
game

the

buried

but
whether
to
hide
his
emotion
or
imbibe
its
contents
we
can
not
distinctly
affirm
we
only
know
that
he
paused
suddenly
drew
a
long
and
deep
breath
and
looked
anxiously
on
as
two
of
the
principal
members
of
the
dingley
dell
club
approached
pickwick
and
said
we
are
about
to
partake
of
a
plain
dinner
at
the
blue
lion
sir
we
hope
you
and
your
friends
will

drawing
one

through

and

he
whispered
confidentially
in
the
ear
of
the
former
gentleman
devilish

peeped
into
the
room
this
morning
fowls
and
pies
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
pleasant
fellows
these
well
behaved
too
there
being
no
further
preliminaries
to
arrange
the
company
straggled
into
the
town
in
little
knots
of
twos
and
threes
and
within
a
quarter
of
an
hour
were
all
seated
in
the
great
room
of
the
blue
lion
inn
muggleton
dumkins
acting
as
chairman
and
luffey
officiating
as
vice
there
was
a
vast
deal
of
talking
and
rattling
of
knives
and
forks
and
plates
a
great
running
about
of
three
waiters
and
a
rapid
disappearance
of
the
substantial
viands
on
the
table
to
each
and
every
of
which
item
of
confusion
the
facetious
jingle
lent
the
aid
of
ordinary
men
at
least
when
everybody
had
eaten
as
much
as
possible
the
cloth
was
removed
bottles
glasses
and
dessert
were
placed
on
the
table
and
the
waiters
withdrew
to
clear
away
or
in
other
words
to
appropriate
to
their
own
private
use
and
emolument
whatever
remnants
of
the
eatables
and
drinkables
they
could
contrive
to
lay
their
hands
on
amidst
the
general
hum
of
mirth
and
conversation
that
ensued
there
was
a
little
man
with
a
puffy
sort
of
countenance
who
remained
very
quiet
occasionally
looking
round
him
when
the
conversation
slackened
as
if
he
contemplated
putting
in
something
very
weighty
and
now
and
then
bursting
into
a
short
cough
of
inexpressible
grandeur
at
length
during
a
moment
of
comparative
silence
the
little
man
called
out
in
a
very
loud
solemn
voice
mr
luffey
everybody
was
hushed
into
a
profound
stillness
as
the
individual
addressed
replied
sir
i
wish
to
address
a
few
words
to
you
sir
if
you
will
entreat
the
gentlemen
to
fill
their
jingle
uttered
a
patronising
hear
hear
which
was
responded
to
by
the
remainder
of
the
company
and
the
glasses
having
been
filled
the
assumed
an
air
of
wisdom
in
a
state
of
profound
attention
and
said
mr
sir
said
the
little
man
rising
i
wish
to
address
what
i
have
to
say
to
you
and
not
to
our
worthy
chairman
because
our
worthy
chairman
is
in
some
measure
i
may
say
in
a
great
degree
the
subject
of
what
i
have
to
say
or
i
may
say
to
to
state
suggested
jingle
yes
to
state
said
the
little
man
i
thank
my
honourable
friend
if
he
will
allow
me
to
call
him
so
four
hears
and
one
certainly
from
jingle
for
the
suggestion
sir
i
am
a
deller
a
dingley
deller
cheers
i
can
not
lay
claim
to
the
honour
of
forming
an
item
in
the
population
of
muggleton
nor
sir
i
will
frankly
admit
do
i
covet
that
honour
and
i
will
tell
you
why
sir
hear
to
muggleton
i
will
readily
concede
all
these
honours
and
distinctions
to
which
it
can
fairly
lay
claim
they
are
too
numerous
and
too
well
known
to
require
aid
or
recapitulation
from
me
but
sir
while
we
remember
that
muggleton
has
given
birth
to
a
dumkins
and
a
podder
let
us
never
forget
that
dingley
dell
can
boast
a
luffey
and
a
struggles
vociferous
cheering
let
me
not
be
considered
as
wishing
to
detract
from
the
merits
of
the
former
gentlemen
sir
i
envy
them
the
luxury
of
their
own
feelings
on
this
occasion
cheers
every
gentleman
who
hears
me
is
probably
acquainted
with
the
reply
made
by
an
individual
who
to
use
an
ordinary
figure
of
speech
hung
out
in
a
tub
to
the
emperor
alexander
if
i
were
not
diogenes
said
he
i
would
be
i
can
well
imagine
these
gentlemen
to
say
if
i
were
not
dumkins
i
would
be
luffey
if
i
were
not
podder
i
would
be
enthusiasm
but
gentlemen
of
muggleton
is
it
in
cricket
alone
that
your
stand
eminent
have
you
never
heard
of
dumkins
and
determination
have
you
never
been
taught
to
associate
podder
with
property
great
applause
have
you
never
when
struggling
for
your
rights
your
liberties
and
your
privileges
been
reduced
if
only
for
an
instant
to
misgiving
and
despair
and
when
you
have
been
thus
depressed
has
not
the
name
of
dumkins
laid
afresh
within
your
breast
the
fire
which
had
just
gone
out
and
has
not
a
word
from
that
man
lighted
it
again
as
brightly
as
if
it
had
never
expired
great
cheering
gentlemen
i
beg
to
surround
with
a
rich
halo
of
enthusiastic
cheering
the
united
names
of
dumkins
and
here
the
little
man
ceased
and
here
the
company
commenced
a
raising
of
voices
and
thumping
of
tables
which
lasted
with
little
intermission
during
the
remainder
of
the
evening
other
toasts
were
drunk
luffey
and
mr
struggles
pickwick
and
jingle
were
each
in
his
turn
the
subject
of
unqualified
eulogium
and
each
in
due
course
returned
thanks
for
the
honour
enthusiastic
as
we
are
in
the
noble
cause
to
which
we
have
devoted
ourselves
we
should
have
felt
a
sensation
of
pride
which
we
can
not
express
and
a
consciousness
of
having
done
something
to
merit
immortality
of
which
we
are
now
deprived
could
we
have
laid
the
faintest
outline
on
these
addresses
before
our
ardent
readers
snodgrass
as
usual
took
a
great
mass
of
notes
which
would
no
doubt
have
afforded
most
useful
and
valuable
information
had
not
the
burning
eloquence
of
the
words
or
the
feverish
influence
of
the
wine
made
that
gentleman
s
hand
so
extremely
unsteady
as
to
render
his
writing
nearly
unintelligible
and
his
style
wholly
so
by
dint
of
patient
investigation
we
have
been
enabled
to
trace
some
characters
bearing
a
faint
resemblance
to
the
names
of
the
speakers
and
we
can
only
discern
an
entry
of
a
song
supposed
to
have
been
sung
by
jingle
in
which
the
words
bowl
sparkling
ruby
bright
and
wine
are
frequently
repeated
at
short
intervals
we
fancy
too
that
we
can
discern
at
the
very
end
of
the
notes
some
indistinct
reference
to
broiled
bones
and
then
the
words
cold
without
occur
but
as
any
hypothesis
we
could
found
upon
them
must
necessarily
rest
upon
mere
conjecture
we
are
not
disposed
to
indulge
in
any
of
the
speculations
to
which
they
may
give
rise
we
will
therefore
return
to
tupman
merely
adding
that
within
some
few
minutes
before
twelve
o
clock
that
night
the
convocation
of
worthies
of
dingley
dell
and
muggleton
were
heard
to
sing
with
great
feeling
and
emphasis
the
beautiful
and
pathetic
national
air
of

chapter
viii
strongly
illustrative
of
the
position
that
the
course
of
true
love
is
not
a
railway
the
quiet
seclusion
of
dingley
dell
the
presence
of
so
many
of
the
gentler
sex
and
the
solicitude
and
anxiety
they
evinced
in
his
behalf
were
all
favourable
to
the
growth
and
development
of
those
softer
feelings
which
nature
had
implanted
deep
in
the
bosom
of
tracy
tupman
and
which
now
appeared
destined
to
centre
in
one
lovely
object
the
young
ladies
were
pretty
their
manners
winning
their
dispositions
unexceptionable
but
there
was
a
dignity
in
the
air
a
ishness
in
the
walk
a
majesty
in
the
eye
of
the
spinster
aunt
to
which
at
their
time
of
life
they
could
lay
no
claim
which
distinguished
her
from
any
female
on
whom
tupman
had
ever
gazed
that
there
was
something
kindred
in
their
nature
something
congenial
in
their
souls
something
mysteriously
sympathetic
in
their
bosoms
was
evident
her
name
was
the
first
that
rose
to
tupman
s
lips
as
he
lay
wounded
on
the
grass
and
her
hysteric
laughter
was
the
first
sound
that
fell
upon
his
ear
when
he
was
supported
to
the
house
but
had
her
agitation
arisen
from
an
amiable
and
feminine
sensibility
which
would
have
been
equally
irrepressible
in
any
case
or
had
it
been
called
forth
by
a
more
ardent
and
passionate
feeling
which
he
of
all
men
living
could
alone
awaken
these
were
the
doubts
which
racked
his
brain
as
he
lay
extended
on
the
sofa
these
were
the
doubts
which
he
determined
should
be
at
once
and
for
ever
resolved
it
was
evening
isabella
and
emily
had
strolled
out
with
trundle
the
deaf
old
lady
had
fallen
asleep
in
her
chair
the
snoring
of
the
fat
boy
penetrated
in
a
low
and
monotonous
sound
from
the
distant
kitchen
the
buxom
servants
were
lounging
at
the
side
door
enjoying
the
pleasantness
of
the
hour
and
the
delights
of
a
flirtation
on
first
principles
with
certain
unwieldy
animals
attached
to
the
farm
and
there
sat
the
interesting
pair
uncared
for
by
all
caring
for
none
and
dreaming
only
of
themselves
there
they
sat
in
short
like
a
pair
of
kid
gloves
bound
up
in
each
other
i
have
forgotten
my
flowers
said
the
spinster
aunt
water
them
now
said
tupman
in
accents
of
persuasion
you
will
take
cold
in
the
evening
air
urged
the
spinster
aunt
affectionately
no
no
said
tupman
rising
it
will
do
me
good
let
me
accompany
the
lady
paused
to
adjust
the
sling
in
which
the
left
arm
of
the
youth
was
placed
and
taking
his
right
arm
led
him
to
the
garden
there
was
a
bower
at
the
farther
end
with
honeysuckle
jessamine
and
creeping
plants
one
of
those
sweet
retreats
which
humane
men
erect
for
the
accommodation
of
spiders
the
spinster
aunt
took
up
a
large
which
lay
in
one
corner
and
was
about
to
leave
the
arbour
tupman
detained
her
and
drew
her
to
a
seat
beside
him
miss
wardle
said
he
the
spinster
aunt
trembled
till
some
pebbles
which
had
accidentally
found
their
way
into
the
large
shook
like
an
infant
s
rattle
miss
wardle
said
tupman
you
are
an
mr
tupman
exclaimed
rachael
blushing
as
red
as
the
itself
nay
said
the
eloquent
pickwickian
i
know
it
but
too
all
women
are
angels
they
say
murmured
the
lady
playfully
then
what
can
you
be
or
to
what
without
presumption
can
i
compare
you
replied
tupman
where
was
the
woman
ever
seen
who
resembled
you
where
else
could
i
hope
to
find
so
rare
a
combination
of
excellence
and
beauty
where
else
could
i
seek
to
oh
here
tupman
paused
and
pressed
the
hand
which
clasped
the
handle
of
the
happy
the
lady
turned
aside
her
head
men
are
such
deceivers
she
softly
whispered
they
are
they
are
ejaculated
tupman
but
not
all
men
there
lives
at
least
one
being
who
can
never
change
one
being
who
would
be
content
to
devote
his
whole
existence
to
your
happiness
who
lives
but
in
your
eyes
who
breathes
but
in
your
smiles
who
bears
the
heavy
burden
of
life
itself
only
for
could
such
an
individual
be
found
said
the
lady
but
he
be
found
said
the
ardent
tupman
interposing
he
found
he
is
here
miss
and
ere
the
lady
was
aware
of
his
intention
tupman
had
sunk
upon
his
knees
at
her
feet
mr
tupman
rise
said
rachael
never
was
the
valorous
reply
oh
rachael
he
seized
her
passive
hand
and
the
fell
to
the
ground
as
he
pressed
it
to
his
oh
rachael
say
you
love
mr
tupman
said
the
spinster
aunt
with
averted
head
i
can
hardly
speak
the
words
but
but
you
are
not
wholly
indifferent
to
tupman
no
sooner
heard
this
avowal
than
he
proceeded
to
do
what
his
enthusiastic
emotions
prompted
and
what
for
aught
we
know
for
we
are
but
little
acquainted
with
such
matters
people
so
circumstanced
always
do
he
jumped
up
and
throwing
his
arm
round
the
neck
of
the
spinster
aunt
imprinted
upon
her
lips
numerous
kisses
which
after
a
due
show
of
struggling
and
resistance
she
received
so
passively
that
there
is
no
telling
how
many
more
tupman
might
have
bestowed
if
the
lady
had
not
given
a
very
unaffected
start
and
exclaimed
in
an
affrighted
tone
mr
tupman
we
are
observed
we
are
discovered
tupman
looked
round
there
was
the
fat
boy
perfectly
motionless
with
his
large
circular
eyes
staring
into
the
arbour
but
without
the
slightest
expression
on
his
face
that
the
most
expert
physiognomist
could
have
referred
to
astonishment
curiosity
or
any
other
known
passion
that
agitates
the
human
breast
tupman
gazed
on
the
fat
boy
and
the
fat
boy
stared
at
him
and
the
longer
tupman
observed
the
utter
vacancy
of
the
fat
boy
s
countenance
the
more
convinced
he
became
that
he
either
did
not
know
or
did
not
understand
anything
that
had
been
going
forward
under
this
impression
he
said
with
great
firmness
what
do
you
want
here
sir
supper
s
ready
sir
was
the
prompt
reply
have
you
just
come
here
sir
inquired
tupman
with
a
piercing
look
just
replied
the
fat
boy
tupman
looked
at
him
very
hard
again
but
there
was
not
a
wink
in
his
eye
or
a
curve
in
his
face
tupman
took
the
arm
of
the
spinster
aunt
and
walked
towards
the
house
the
fat
boy
followed
behind
he
knows
nothing
of
what
has
happened
he
whispered
nothing
said
the
spinster
aunt
there
was
a
sound
behind
them
as
of
an
imperfectly
suppressed
chuckle
tupman
turned
sharply
round
no
it
could
not
have
been
the
fat
boy
there
was
not
a
gleam
of
mirth
or
anything
but
feeding
in
his
whole
visage
he
must
have
been
fast
asleep
whispered
tupman
i
have
not
the
least
doubt
of
it
replied
the
spinster
aunt
they
both
laughed
heartily
tupman
was
wrong
the
fat
boy
for
once
had
not
been
fast
asleep
he
was
awake
wide
awake
to
what
had
been
going
forward
the
supper
passed
off
without
any
attempt
at
a
general
conversation
the
old
lady
had
gone
to
bed
isabella
wardle
devoted
herself
exclusively
to
trundle
the
spinster
s
attentions
were
reserved
for
tupman
and
emily
s
thoughts
appeared
to
be
engrossed
by
some
distant
object
possibly
they
were
with
the
absent
snodgrass
eleven
twelve
one
o
clock
had
struck
and
the
gentlemen
had
not
arrived
consternation
sat
on
every
face
could
they
have
been
waylaid
and
robbed
should
they
send
men
and
lanterns
in
every
direction
by
which
they
could
be
supposed
likely
to
have
travelled
home
or
should
they
hark
there
they
were
what
could
have
made
them
so
late
a
strange
voice
too
to
whom
could
it
belong
they
rushed
into
the
kitchen
whither
the
truants
had
repaired
and
at
once
obtained
rather
more
than
a
glimmering
of
the
real
state
of
the
case
pickwick
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
his
hat
cocked
completely
over
his
left
eye
was
leaning
against
the
dresser
shaking
his
head
from
side
to
side
and
producing
a
constant
succession
of
the
blandest
and
most
benevolent
smiles
without
being
moved
thereunto
by
any
discernible
cause
or
pretence
whatsoever
old
wardle
with
a
inflamed
countenance
was
grasping
the
hand
of
a
strange
gentleman
muttering
protestations
of
eternal
friendship
winkle
supporting
himself
by
the
clock
was
feebly
invoking
destruction
upon
the
head
of
any
member
of
the
family
who
should
suggest
the
propriety
of
his
retiring
for
the
night
and
snodgrass
had
sunk
into
a
chair
with
an
expression
of
the
most
abject
and
hopeless
misery
that
the
human
mind
can
imagine
portrayed
in
every
lineament
of
his
expressive
face
is
anything
the
matter
inquired
the
three
ladies
nothing
the
matter
replied
pickwick
we

snodgrass
in
a
broken
voice
it

somehow

it
never

in
these
cases
hadn

said
winkle
firmly
no
living
boy
shall
carry
me
said
pickwick
stoutly
and
he
went
on
smiling
as
before
hurrah
gasped
winkle
faintly
hurrah
echoed
pickwick
taking
off
his
hat
and
dashing
it
on
the
floor
and
insanely
casting
his
spectacles
into
the
middle
of
the
kitchen
at
this
humorous
feat
he
laughed
outright
let
s
have
nother
bottle
cried
winkle
commencing
in
a
very
loud
key
and
ending
in
a
very
faint
one
his
head
dropped
upon
his
breast
and
muttering
his
invincible
determination
not
to
go
to
his
bed
and
a
sanguinary
regret
that
he
had
not
done
for
old
tupman
in
the
morning
he
fell
fast
asleep
in
which
condition
he
was
borne
to
his
apartment
by
two
young
giants
under
the
personal
superintendence
of
the
fat
boy
to
whose
protecting
care
snodgrass
shortly
afterwards
confided
his
own
person
pickwick
accepted
the
proffered
arm
of
tupman
and
quietly
disappeared
smiling
more
than
ever
and
wardle
after
taking
as
affectionate
a
leave
of
the
whole
family
as
if
he
were
ordered
for
immediate
execution
consigned
to
trundle
the
honour
of
conveying
him
upstairs
and
retired
with
a
very
futile
attempt
to
look
impressively
solemn
and
dignified
what
a
shocking
scene
said
the
spinster
aunt
ejaculated
both
the
young
ladies
dreadful
dreadful
said
jingle
looking
very
grave
he
was
about
a
bottle
and
a
half
ahead
of
any
of
his
companions
horrid
spectacle
very
what
a
nice
man
whispered
the
spinster
aunt
to
tupman
too
whispered
emily
wardle
oh
decidedly
observed
the
spinster
aunt
tupman
thought
of
the
widow
at
rochester
and
his
mind
was
troubled
the
succeeding
s
conversation
was
not
of
a
nature
to
calm
his
perturbed
spirit
the
new
visitor
was
very
talkative
and
the
number
of
his
anecdotes
was
only
to
be
exceeded
by
the
extent
of
his
politeness
tupman
felt
that
as
jingle
s
popularity
increased
he
tupman
retired
further
into
the
shade
his
laughter
was
forced
his
merriment
feigned
and
when
at
last
he
laid
his
aching
temples
between
the
sheets
he
thought
with
horrid
delight
on
the
satisfaction
it
would
afford
him
to
have
jingle
s
head
at
that
moment
between
the
feather
bed
and
the
mattress
the
indefatigable
stranger
rose
betimes
next
morning
and
although
his
companions
remained
in
bed
overpowered
with
the
dissipation
of
the
previous
night
exerted
himself
most
successfully
to
promote
the
hilarity
of
the
so
successful
were
his
efforts
that
even
the
deaf
old
lady
insisted
on
having
one
or
two
of
his
best
jokes
retailed
through
the
trumpet
and
even
she
condescended
to
observe
to
the
spinster
aunt
that
he
meaning
jingle
was
an
impudent
young
fellow
a
sentiment
in
which
all
her
relations
then
and
there
present
thoroughly
coincided
it
was
the
old
lady
s
habit
on
the
fine
summer
mornings
to
repair
to
the
arbour
in
which
tupman
had
already
signalised
himself
in
form
and
manner
following
first
the
fat
boy
fetched
from
a
peg
behind
the
old
lady
s
bedroom
door
a
close
black
satin
bonnet
a
warm
cotton
shawl
and
a
thick
stick
with
a
capacious
handle
and
the
old
lady
having
put
on
the
bonnet
and
shawl
at
her
leisure
would
lean
one
hand
on
the
stick
and
the
other
on
the
fat
boy
s
shoulder
and
walk
leisurely
to
the
arbour
where
the
fat
boy
would
leave
her
to
enjoy
the
fresh
air
for
the
space
of
half
an
hour
at
the
expiration
of
which
time
he
would
return
and
reconduct
her
to
the
house
the
old
lady
was
very
precise
and
very
particular
and
as
this
ceremony
had
been
observed
for
three
successive
summers
without
the
slightest
deviation
from
the
accustomed
form
she
was
not
a
little
surprised
on
this
particular
morning
to
see
the
fat
boy
instead
of
leaving
the
arbour
walk
a
few
paces
out
of
it
look
carefully
round
him
in
every
direction
and
return
towards
her
with
great
stealth
and
an
air
of
the
most
profound
mystery
the
old
lady
was
timorous
most
old
ladies
are
and
her
first
impression
was
that
the
bloated
lad
was
about
to
do
her
some
grievous
bodily
harm
with
the
view
of
possessing
himself
of
her
loose
coin
she
would
have
cried
for
assistance
but
age
and
infirmity
had
long
ago
deprived
her
of
the
power
of
screaming
she
therefore
watched
his
motions
with
feelings
of
intense
horror
which
were
in
no
degree
diminished
by
his
coming
close
up
to
her
and
shouting
in
her
ear
in
an
agitated
and
as
it
seemed
to
her
a
threatening
tone
missus
now
it
so
happened
that
jingle
was
walking
in
the
garden
close
to
the
arbour
at
that
moment
he
too
heard
the
shouts
of
missus
and
stopped
to
hear
more
there
were
three
reasons
for
his
doing
so
in
the
first
place
he
was
idle
and
curious
secondly
he
was
by
no
means
scrupulous
thirdly
and
lastly
he
was
concealed
from
view
by
some
flowering
shrubs
so
there
he
stood
and
there
he
listened
missus
shouted
the
fat
boy
well
joe
said
the
trembling
old
lady
i
m
sure
i
have
been
a
good
mistress
to
you
joe
you
have
invariably
been
treated
very
kindly
you
have
never
had
too
much
to
do
and
you
have
always
had
enough
to
this
last
was
an
appeal
to
the
fat
boy
s
most
sensitive
feelings
he
seemed
touched
as
he
replied
emphatically
i
knows
i
then
what
can
you
want
to
do
now
said
the
old
lady
gaining
courage
i
wants
to
make
your
flesh
creep
replied
the
boy
this
sounded
like
a
very
bloodthirsty
mode
of
showing
one
s
gratitude
and
as
the
old
lady
did
not
precisely
understand
the
process
by
which
such
a
result
was
to
be
attained
all
her
former
horrors
returned
what
do
you
think
i
see
in
this
very
arbour
last
night
inquired
the
boy
bless
us
what
exclaimed
the
old
lady
alarmed
at
the
solemn
manner
of
the
corpulent
youth
the
strange
gentleman
him
as
had
his
arm
hurt
and
huggin
who
joe
none
of
the
servants
i
worser
than
that
roared
the
fat
boy
in
the
old
lady
s
ear
not
one
of
my
grandda
aters
worser
than
worse
than
that
joe
said
the
old
lady
who
had
thought
this
the
extreme
limit
of
human
atrocity
who
was
it
joe
i
insist
upon
the
fat
boy
looked
cautiously
round
and
having
concluded
his
survey
shouted
in
the
old
lady
s
ear
miss
what
said
the
old
lady
in
a
shrill
tone
speak
miss
rachael
roared
the
fat
boy
my
da
ater
the
train
of
nods
which
the
fat
boy
gave
by
way
of
assent
communicated
a
like
motion
to
his
fat
cheeks
and
she
suffered
him
exclaimed
the
old
lady
a
grin
stole
over
the
fat
boy
s
features
as
he
said
i
see
her
of
him
if
jingle
from
his
place
of
concealment
could
have
beheld
the
expression
which
the
old
lady
s
face
assumed
at
this
communication
the
probability
is
that
a
sudden
burst
of
laughter
would
have
betrayed
his
close
vicinity
to
the
he
listened
attentively
fragments
of
angry
sentences
such
as
without
my
permission
at
her
time
of
life
miserable
old
ooman
like
me
might
have
waited
till
i
was
dead
and
so
forth
reached
his
ears
and
then
he
heard
the
heels
of
the
fat
boy
s
boots
crunching
the
gravel
as
he
retired
and
left
the
old
lady
alone
it
was
a
remarkable
coincidence
perhaps
but
it
was
nevertheless
a
fact
that
jingle
within
five
minutes
of
his
arrival
at
manor
farm
on
the
preceding
night
had
inwardly
resolved
to
lay
siege
to
the
heart
of
the
spinster
aunt
without
delay
he
had
observation
enough
to
see
that
his
manner
was
by
no
means
disagreeable
to
the
fair
object
of
his
attack
and
he
had
more
than
a
strong
suspicion
that
she
possessed
that
most
desirable
of
all
requisites
a
small
independence
the
imperative
necessity
of
ousting
his
rival
by
some
means
or
other
flashed
quickly
upon
him
and
he
immediately
resolved
to
adopt
certain
proceedings
tending
to
that
end
and
object
without
a
moment
s
delay
fielding
tells
us
that
man
is
fire
and
woman

and
the
prince
of
darkness
sets
a
light
to
em
jingle
knew
that
young
men
to
spinster
aunts
are
as
lighted
gas
to
gunpowder
and
he
determined
to
essay
the
effect
of
an
explosion
without
loss
of
time
full
of
reflections
upon
this
important
decision
he
crept
from
his
place
of
concealment
and
under
cover
of
the
shrubs
before
mentioned
approached
the
house
fortune
seemed
determined
to
favour
his
design
tupman
and
the
rest
of
the
gentlemen
left
the
garden
by
the
side
gate
just
as
he
obtained
a
view
of
it
and
the
young
ladies
he
knew
had
walked
out
alone
soon
after
breakfast
the
coast
was
clear
the
door
was
partially
open
he
peeped
in
the
spinster
aunt
was
knitting
he
coughed
she
looked
up
and
smiled
hesitation
formed
no
part
of
alfred
jingle
s
character
he
laid
his
finger
on
his
lips
mysteriously
walked
in
and
closed
the
door
miss
wardle
said
jingle
with
affected
earnestness
forgive
intrusion
short
acquaintance
no
time
for
ceremony
all
sir
said
the
spinster
aunt
rather
astonished
by
the
unexpected
apparition
and
somewhat
doubtful
of
jingle
s
sanity
hush
said
jingle
in
a
large
boy
dumpling
face
round
eyes
rascal
here
he
shook
his
head
expressively
and
the
spinster
aunt
trembled
with
agitation
i
presume
you
allude
to
joseph
sir
said
the
lady
making
an
effort
to
appear
composed
yes

the
old
lady
old

said
the
spinster
aunt
if
you
come
here
sir
to
insult
me

at
all
by
no
means
replied
the
unabashed
jingle

the
tale
came
to
warn
you
of
your
danger
tender
my
services
prevent
the
hubbub
never
mind
think
it
an
insult
leave
the
room
and
he
turned
as
if
to
carry
the
threat
into
execution
what
i
do
said
the
poor
spinster
bursting
into
tears
my
brother
will
be
of
course
he
will
said
jingle
pausing
oh
jingle
what
i
say
exclaimed
the
spinster
aunt
in
another
flood
of
despair
say
he
dreamt
it
replied
jingle
coolly
a
ray
of
comfort
darted
across
the
mind
of
the
spinster
aunt
at
this
suggestion
jingle
perceived
it
and
followed
up
his
advantage
pooh
pooh
nothing
more
easy
blackguard
boy
lovely
woman
fat
boy
horsewhipped
you
believed
end
of
the
matter
all
whether
the
probability
of
escaping
from
the
consequences
of
this
timed
discovery
was
delightful
to
the
spinster
s
feelings
or
whether
the
hearing
herself
described
as
a
lovely
woman
softened
the
asperity
of
her
grief
we
know
not
she
blushed
slightly
and
cast
a
grateful
look
on
jingle
that
insinuating
gentleman
sighed
deeply
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
spinster
aunt
s
face
for
a
couple
of
minutes
started
melodramatically
and
suddenly
withdrew
them
you
seem
unhappy
jingle
said
the
lady
in
a
plaintive
voice
may
i
show
my
gratitude
for

of
a

with
a
professional
theatrical
air
never
and
by
way
of
showing
that
he
had
no
desire
to
be
questioned
further
he
drew
a
chair
close
to
that
of
the
spinster
aunt
and
sat
down

he
appeared
to
be
struggling
with
various
conflicting
emotions
for
a
few
seconds
and
then
said
in
a
low
voice

the
spinster
with
energetic
indignation

the

there
was
a
pause
now
if
there
was
one
individual
in
the
whole
world
of
whom
the
spinster
aunt
entertained
a
mortal
and
jealousy
it
was
this
identical
niece
the
colour
rushed
over
her
face
and
neck
and
she
tossed
her
head
in
silence
with
an
air
of
ineffable
contempt
at
last
biting
her
thin
lips
and
bridling
up
she
said

fell
on
his
knees
remained
thereupon
for
five
minutes
thereafter
and
rose
the
accepted
lover
of
the
spinster
aunt
conditionally
upon
tupman
s
perjury
being
made
clear
and
manifest
the
burden
of
proof
lay
with
alfred
jingle
and
he
produced
his
evidence
that
very
day
at
dinner
the
spinster
aunt
could
hardly
believe
her
eyes
tracy
tupman
was
established
at
emily
s
side
ogling
whispering
and
smiling
in
opposition
to
snodgrass
not
a
word
not
a
look
not
a
glance
did
he
bestow
upon
his
heart
s
pride
of
the
evening
before
damn
that
boy
thought
old
wardle
to
he
had
heard
the
story
from
his
mother
damn
that
boy
he
must
have
been
asleep
it
s
all
traitor
thought
the
spinster
aunt
dear
jingle
was
not
deceiving
me
ugh
how
i
hate
the
wretch
the
following
conversation
may
serve
to
explain
to
our
readers
this
apparently
unaccountable
alteration
of
deportment
on
the
part
of
tracy
tupman
the
time
was
evening
the
scene
the
garden
there
were
two
figures
walking
in
a
side
path
one
was
rather
short
and
stout
the
other
tall
and
slim
they
were
tupman
and
jingle
the
stout
figure
commenced
the
dialogue
how
did
i
do
it
he
inquired
splendid
capital
couldn
t
act
better
myself
you
must
repeat
the
part
every
evening
till
further
does
rachael
still
wish
it
of
course
she
don
t
like
it
but
must
be
done
avert
suspicion
afraid
of
her
brother
says
there
s
no
help
for
it
only
a
few
days
more
when
old
folks
blinded
crown
your
any
message
love
best
love
kindest
regards
unalterable
affection
can
i
say
anything
for
you
my
dear
fellow
replied
the
unsuspicious
tupman
fervently
grasping
his
friend
s
hand
carry
my
best
love
say
how
hard
i
find
it
to
dissemble
say
anything
that
s
kind
but
add
how
sensible
i
am
of
the
necessity
of
the
suggestion
she
made
to
me
through
you
this
morning
say
i
applaud
her
wisdom
and
admire
her
i
will
anything
more
nothing
only
add
how
ardently
i
long
for
the
time
when
i
may
call
her
mine
and
all
dissimulation
may
be
certainly
certainly
anything
more
oh
my
friend
said
poor
tupman
again
grasping
the
hand
of
his
companion
receive
my
warmest
thanks
for
your
disinterested
kindness
and
forgive
me
if
i
have
ever
even
in
thought
done
you
the
injustice
of
supposing
that
you
could
stand
in
my
way
my
dear
friend
can
i
ever
repay
you
don
t
talk
of
it
replied
jingle
he
stopped
short
as
if
suddenly
recollecting
something
and
said
by
the
bye
can
t
spare
ten
pounds
can
you
very
particular
purpose
pay
you
in
three
i
dare
say
i
can
replied
tupman
in
the
fulness
of
his
heart
three
days
you
say
only
three
days
all
over
then
no
more
tupman
counted
the
money
into
his
companion
s
hand
and
he
dropped
it
piece
by
piece
into
his
pocket
as
they
walked
towards
the
house
be
careful
said
jingle
not
a
not
a
wink
said
tupman
not
a
not
a
all
your
attentions
to
the
niece
rather
rude
than
otherwise
to
the
aunt
only
way
of
deceiving
the
old
i
ll
take
care
said
tupman
aloud
and
take
care
said
jingle
internally
and
they
entered
the
house
the
scene
of
that
afternoon
was
repeated
that
evening
and
on
the
three
afternoons
and
evenings
next
ensuing
on
the
fourth
the
host
was
in
high
spirits
for
he
had
satisfied
himself
that
there
was
no
ground
for
the
charge
against
tupman
so
was
tupman
for
jingle
had
told
him
that
his
affair
would
soon
be
brought
to
a
crisis
so
was
pickwick
for
he
was
seldom
otherwise
so
was
not
snodgrass
for
he
had
grown
jealous
of
tupman
so
was
the
old
lady
for
she
had
been
winning
at
whist
so
were
jingle
and
miss
wardle
for
reasons
of
sufficient
importance
in
this
eventful
history
to
be
narrated
in
another

the
chairs

drawn
round
the
table
bottles
jugs
and
glasses
were
arranged
upon
the
sideboard
and
everything
betokened
the
approach
of
the
most
convivial
period
in
the
whole
hours
where

rachael
said
wardle
ay
and
jingle
added
pickwick

the

he
didn

pickwick

the

pickwick
and
down
they
sat
there
was
a
gigantic
round
of
cold
beef
on
the
table
and
pickwick
was
supplied
with
a
plentiful
portion
of
it
he
had
raised
his
fork
to
his
lips
and
was
on
the
very
point
of
opening
his
mouth
for
the
reception
of
a
piece
of
beef
when
the
hum
of
many
voices
suddenly
arose
in
the
kitchen
he
paused
and
laid
down
his
fork
wardle
paused
too
and
insensibly
released
his
hold
of
the
which
remained
inserted
in
the
beef
he
looked
at
pickwick
pickwick
looked
at
him
heavy
footsteps
were
heard
in
the
passage
the
parlour
door
was
suddenly
burst
open
and
the
man
who
had
cleaned
pickwick
s
boots
on
his
first
arrival
rushed
into
the
room
followed
by
the
fat
boy
and
all
the
domestics

the
unhappy

round
and
round
the
apartment
in
a
transport
of
frenzy

extraordinary
gestures
of
his
friend
with
terrified
surprise

s
gone

cried
wardle
as
he
rushed
at
the
starred
youth
he
was
bribed
by
that
scoundrel
jingle
to
put
me
on
a
wrong
scent
by
telling
a
story
of

go
sir
it
was
a
beautiful
sight
in
that
moment
of
turmoil
and
confusion
to
behold
the
placid
and
philosophical
expression
of
pickwick
s
face
albeit
somewhat
flushed
with
exertion
as
he
stood
with
his
arms
firmly
clasped
round
the
extensive
waist
of
their
corpulent
host
thus
restraining
the
impetuosity
of
his
passion
while
the
fat
boy
was
scratched
and
pulled
and
pushed
from
the
room
by
all
the
females
congregated
therein
he
had
no
sooner
released
his
hold
than
the
man
entered
to
announce
that
the

a
large
shawl

thrown
over

he
replied
in
the
affirmative
they
jumped
into
the
gig
give
her
her
head
tom
cried
the
host
and
away
they
went
down
the
narrow
lanes
jolting
in
and
out
of
the
ruts
and
bumping
up
against
the
hedges
on
either
side
as
if
they
would
go
to
pieces
every
moment
how
much
are
they
ahead
shouted
wardle
as
they
drove
up
to
the
door
of
the
blue
lion
round
which
a
little
crowd
had
collected
late
as
it
was
not
above
of
an
hour
was
everybody
s
reply
directly
out
with
em
put
up
the
gig
now
boys
cried
the
landlord
out
make
haste
look
alive
there
away
ran
the
hostlers
and
the
boys
the
lanterns
glimmered
as
the
men
ran
to
and
fro
the
horses
hoofs
clattered
on
the
uneven
paving
of
the
yard
the
chaise
rumbled
as
it
was
drawn
out
of
the
and
all
was
noise
and
bustle
now
then
is
that
chaise
coming
out
cried
wardle
coming
down
the
yard
now
sir
replied
the
hostler
out
came
the
chaise
in

horses
on

the

stage
in
less
than
half
an
hour
shouted
wardle
off
with
you
the
boys
applied
whip
and
spur
the
waiters
shouted
the
hostlers
cheered
and
away
they
went
fast
and
furiously
pretty
situation
thought
pickwick
when
he
had
had
a
moment
s
time
for
reflection
pretty
situation
for
the
general
chairman
of
the
pickwick
club
damp

strange
horses
fifteen
miles
an
hour
and
twelve
o
clock
at
night
for
the
first
three
or
four
miles
not
a
word
was
spoken
by
either
of
the
gentlemen
each
being
too
much
immersed
in
his
own
reflections
to
address
any
observations
to
his
companion
when
they
had
gone
over
that
much
ground
however
and
the
horses
getting
thoroughly
warmed
began
to
do
their
work
in
really
good
style
pickwick
became
too
much
exhilarated
with
the
rapidity
of
the
motion
to
remain
any
longer
perfectly
mute
we
re
sure
to
catch
them
i
think
said
he
hope
so
replied
his
companion
fine
night
said
pickwick
looking
up
at
the
moon
which
was
shining
brightly
so
much
the
worse
returned
wardle
for
they
ll
have
had
all
the
advantage
of
the
moonlight
to
get
the
start
of
us
and
we
shall
lose
it
it
will
have
gone
down
in
another
it
will
be
rather
unpleasant
going
at
this
rate
in
the
dark
won
t
it
inquired
pickwick
i
dare
say
it
will
replied
his
friend
dryly
pickwick
s
temporary
excitement
began
to
sober
down
a
little
as
he
reflected
upon
the
inconveniences
and
dangers
of
the
expedition
in
which
he
had
so
thoughtlessly
embarked
he
was
roused
by
a
loud
shouting
of
the
on
the
leader
went
the
first
boy
went
the
second
chimed
in
old
wardle
himself
most
lustily
with
his
head
and
half
his
body
out
of
the
coach
window
shouted
pickwick
taking
up
the
burden
of
the
cry
though
he
had
not
the
slightest
notion
of
its
meaning
or
object
and
amidst
the
of
the
whole
four
the
chaise
stopped
what
s
the
matter
inquired
pickwick
there
s
a
gate
here
replied
old
wardle
we
shall
hear
something
of
the
after
a
lapse
of
five
minutes
consumed
in
incessant
knocking
and
shouting
an
old
man
in
his
shirt
and
trousers
emerged
from
the
and
opened
the
gate
how
long
is
it
since
a
went
through
here
inquired
wardle
how
long
ah
why
i
don
t
rightly
know
it
worn
t
a
long
time
ago
nor
it
worn
t
a
short
time
ago
just
between
the
two
has
any
chaise
been
by
at
all
oh
yes
there
s
been
a
chay
how
long
ago
my
friend
interposed
pickwick
an
hour
ah
i
dare
say
it
might
be
replied
the
man
or
two
hours
inquired
the
post
boy
on
the
wheeler
well
i
shouldn
t
wonder
if
it
was
returned
the
old
man
doubtfully
drive
on
boys
cried
the
testy
old
gentleman
don
t
waste
any
more
time
with
that
old
idiot
idiot
exclaimed
the
old
man
with
a
grin
as
he
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
road
with
the
gate
watching
the
chaise
which
rapidly
diminished
in
the
increasing
distance
no
not
much
o
that
either
you
ve
lost
ten
minutes
here
and
gone
away
as
wise
as
you
came
arter
all
if
every
man
on
the
line
as
has
a
guinea
give
him
earns
it
half
as
well
you
won
t
catch
t
other
chay
this
side
mich
lmas
old
and
with
another
prolonged
grin
the
old
man
closed
the
gate
entered
his
house
and
bolted
the
door
after
him
meanwhile
the
chaise
proceeded
without
any
slackening
of
pace
towards
the
conclusion
of
the
stage
the
moon
as
wardle
had
foretold
was
rapidly
on
the
wane
large
tiers
of
dark
heavy
clouds
which
had
been
gradually
overspreading
the
sky
for
some
time
past
now
formed
one
black
mass
overhead
and
large
drops
of
rain
which
pattered
every
now
and
then
against
the
windows
of
the
chaise
seemed
to
warn
the
travellers
of
the
rapid
approach
of
a
stormy
night
the
wind
too
which
was
directly
against
them
swept
in
furious
gusts
down
the
narrow
road
and
howled
dismally
through
the
trees
which
skirted
the
pathway
pickwick
drew
his
coat
closer
about
him
coiled
himself
more
snugly
up
into
the
corner
of
the
chaise
and
fell
into
a
sound
sleep
from
which
he
was
only
awakened
by
the
stopping
of
the
vehicle
the
sound
of
the
hostler
s
bell
and
a
loud
cry
of
horses
on
directly
but
here
another
delay
occurred
the
boys
were
sleeping
with
such
mysterious
soundness
that
it
took
five
minutes
to
wake
them
the
hostler
had
somehow
or
other
mislaid
the
key
of
the
stable
and
even
when
that
was
found
two
sleepy
helpers
put
the
wrong
harness
on
the
wrong
horses
and
the
whole
process
of
harnessing
had
to
be
gone
through
afresh
had
pickwick
been
alone
these
multiplied
obstacles
would
have
completely
put
an
end
to
the
pursuit
at
once
but
old
wardle
was
not
to
be
so
easily
daunted
and
he
laid
about
him
with
such
hearty
cuffing
this
man
and
pushing
that
strapping
a
buckle
here
and
taking
in
a
link
there
that
the
chaise
was
ready
in
a
much
shorter
time
than
could
reasonably
have
been
expected
under
so
many
difficulties
they
resumed
their
journey
and
certainly
the
prospect
before
them
was
by
no
means
encouraging
the
stage
was
fifteen
miles
long
the
night
was
dark
the
wind
high
and
the
rain
pouring
in
torrents
it
was
impossible
to
make
any
great
way
against
such
obstacles
united
it
was
hard
upon
one
o
clock
already
and
nearly
two
hours
were
consumed
in
getting
to
the
end
of
the
stage
here
however
an
object
presented
itself
which
rekindled
their
hopes
and
reanimated
their
drooping
spirits
when
did
this
chaise
come
in
cried
old
wardle
leaping
out
of
his
own
vehicle
and
pointing
to
one
covered
with
wet
mud
which
was
standing
in
the
yard
not
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ago
sir
replied
the
hostler
to
whom
the
question
was
addressed
lady
and
gentleman
inquired
wardle
almost
breathless
with
impatience
yes
tall
gentleman
long
legs
thin
body
yes
elderly
lady
thin
face
rather
skinny
eh
yes
by
heavens
it
s
the
couple
pickwick
exclaimed
the
old
gentleman
would
have
been
here
before
said
the
hostler
but
they
broke
a
tis
them
said
wardle
it
is
by
jove
instantly
we
shall
catch
them
yet
before
they
reach
the
next
stage
a
guinea
alive
there
bustle
about
there
s
good
and
with
such
admonitions
as
these
the
old
gentleman
ran
up
and
down
the
yard
and
bustled
to
and
fro
in
a
state
of
excitement
which
communicated
itself
to
pickwick
also
and
under
the
influence
of
which
that
gentleman
got
himself
into
complicated
entanglements
with
harness
and
mixed
up
with
horses
and
wheels
of
chaises
in
the
most
surprising
manner
firmly
believing
that
by
so
doing
he
was
materially
forwarding
the
preparations
for
their
resuming
their
journey
jump
in
jump
in
cried
old
wardle
climbing
into
the
chaise
pulling
up
the
steps
and
slamming
the
door
after
him
come
along
make
haste
and
before
pickwick
knew
precisely
what
he
was
about
he
felt
himself
forced
in
at
the
other
door
by
one
pull
from
the
old
gentleman
and
one
push
from
the
hostler
and
off
they
were
again
ah
we
are
moving
now
said
the
old
gentleman
exultingly
they
were
indeed
as
was
sufficiently
testified
to
pickwick
by
his
constant
collision
either
with
the
hard
of
the
chaise
or
the
body
of
his
companion
hold
up
said
the
stout
old
wardle
as
pickwick
dived
head
foremost
into
his
capacious
waistcoat
i
never
did
feel
such
a
jolting
in
my
life
said
pickwick
never
mind
replied
his
companion
it
will
soon
be
over
steady
pickwick
planted
himself
into
his
own
corner
as
firmly
as
he
could
and
on
whirled
the
chaise
faster
than
ever
they
had
travelled
in
this
way
about
three
miles
when
wardle
who
had
been
looking
out
of
the
window
for
two
or
three
minutes
suddenly
drew
in
his
face
covered
with
splashes
and
exclaimed
in
breathless
eagerness
here
they
are
pickwick
thrust
his
head
out
of
his
window
yes
there
was
a
a
short
distance
before
them
dashing
along
at
full
gallop
go
on
go
on
almost
shrieked
the
old
gentleman
two
guineas
boys
don
t
let
em
gain
on
us
keep
it
up
keep
it
the
horses
in
the
first
chaise
started
on
at
their
utmost
speed
and
those
in
wardle
s
galloped
furiously
behind
them
i
see
his
head
exclaimed
the
choleric
old
man
damme
i
see
his
so
do
i
said
pickwick
that
s
pickwick
was
not
mistaken
the
countenance
of
jingle
completely
coated
with
mud
thrown
up
by
the
wheels
was
plainly
discernible
at
the
window
of
his
chaise
and
the
motion
of
his
arm
which
was
waving
violently
towards
the
postillions
denoted
that
he
was
encouraging
them
to
increased
exertion
the
interest
was
intense
fields
trees
and
hedges
seemed
to
rush
past
them
with
the
velocity
of
a
whirlwind
so
rapid
was
the
pace
at
which
they
tore
along
they
were
close
by
the
side
of
the
first
chaise
jingle
s
voice
could
be
plainly
heard
even
above
the
din
of
the
wheels
urging
on
the
boys
old
wardle
foamed
with
rage
and
excitement
he
roared
out
scoundrels
and
villains
by
the
dozen
clenched
his
fist
and
shook
it
expressively
at
the
object
of
his
indignation
but
jingle
only
answered
with
a
contemptuous
smile
and
replied
to
his
menaces
by
a
shout
of
triumph
as
his
horses
answering
the
increased
application
of
whip
and
spur
broke
into
a
faster
gallop
and
left
the
pursuers
behind
pickwick
had
just
drawn
in
his
head
and
wardle
exhausted
with
shouting
had
done
the
same
when
a
tremendous
jolt
threw
them
forward
against
the
front
of
the
vehicle
there
was
a
sudden
bump
a
loud
rolled
a
wheel
and
over
went
the
chaise
after
a
very
few
seconds
of
bewilderment
and
confusion
in
which
nothing
but
the
plunging
of
horses
and
breaking
of
glass
could
be
made
out
pickwick
felt
himself
violently
pulled
out
from
among
the
ruins
of
the
chaise
and
as
soon
as
he
had
gained
his
feet
extricated
his
head
from
the
skirts
of
his
greatcoat
which
materially
impeded
the
usefulness
of
his
spectacles
the
full
disaster
of
the
case
met
his
view
old
wardle
without
a
hat
and
his
clothes
torn
in
several
places
stood
by
his
side
and
the
fragments
of
the
chaise
lay
scattered
at
their
feet
the
who
had
succeeded
in
cutting
the
traces
were
standing
disfigured
with
mud
and
disordered
by
hard
riding
by
the
horses
heads
about
a
hundred
yards
in
advance
was
the
other
chaise
which
had
pulled
up
on
hearing
the
crash
the
postillions
each
with
a
broad
grin
convulsing
his
countenance
were
viewing
the
adverse
party
from
their
saddles
and
jingle
was
contemplating
the
wreck
from
the
coach
window
with
evident
satisfaction
the
day
was
just
breaking
and
the
whole
scene
was
rendered
perfectly
visible
by
the
grey
light
of
the
morning
hollo
shouted
the
shameless
jingle
anybody
damaged
elderly
gentlemen
no
light
weights
dangerous
work
you
re
a
rascal
roared
wardle
ha
ha
replied
jingle
and
then
he
added
with
a
knowing
wink
and
a
jerk
of
the
thumb
towards
the
interior
of
the
chaise
i
say
she
s
very
well
desires
her
compliments
begs
you
won
t
trouble
yourself
love
to
won
t
you
get
up
behind
drive
on
the
postillions
resumed
their
proper
attitudes
and
away
rattled
the
chaise
jingle
fluttering
in
derision
a
white
handkerchief
from
the
coach
window
nothing
in
the
whole
adventure
not
even
the
upset
had
disturbed
the
calm
and
equable
current
of
pickwick
s
temper
the
villainy
however
which
could
first
borrow
money
of
his
faithful
follower
and
then
abbreviate
his
name
to
tuppy
was
more
than
he
could
patiently
bear
he
drew
his
breath
hard
and
coloured
up
to
the
very
tips
of
his
spectacles
as
he
said
slowly
and
emphatically
if
ever
i
meet
that
man
again
i
ll
yes
yes
interrupted
wardle
that
s
all
very
well
but
while
we
stand
talking
here
they
ll
get
their
licence
and
be
married
in
pickwick
paused
bottled
up
his
vengeance
and
corked
it
down
how
far
is
it
to
the
next
stage
inquired
wardle
of
one
of
the
boys
six
mile
ain
t
it
tom
rayther
rayther
better
nor
six
mile
can
t
be
helped
said
wardle
we
must
walk
it
no
help
for
it
replied
that
truly
great
man
so
sending
forward
one
of
the
boys
on
horseback
to
procure
a
fresh
chaise
and
horses
and
leaving
the
other
behind
to
take
care
of
the
broken
one
pickwick
and
wardle
set
manfully
forward
on
the
walk
first
tying
their
shawls
round
their
necks
and
slouching
down
their
hats
to
escape
as
much
as
possible
from
the
deluge
of
rain
which
after
a
slight
cessation
had
again
begun
to
pour
heavily
down
chapter
x
clearing
up
all
doubts
if
any
existed
of
the
disinterestedness
of
jingle
s
character
there
are
in
london
several
old
inns
once
the
headquarters
of
celebrated
coaches
in
the
days
when
coaches
performed
their
journeys
in
a
graver
and
more
solemn
manner
than
they
do
in
these
times
but
which
have
now
degenerated
into
little
more
than
the
abiding
and
places
of
country
wagons
the
reader
would
look
in
vain
for
any
of
these
ancient
hostelries
among
the
golden
crosses
and
bull
and
mouths
which
rear
their
stately
fronts
in
the
improved
streets
of
london
if
he
would
light
upon
any
of
these
old
places
he
must
direct
his
steps
to
the
obscurer
quarters
of
the
town
and
there
in
some
secluded
nooks
he
will
find
several
still
standing
with
a
kind
of
gloomy
sturdiness
amidst
the
modern
innovations
which
surround
them
in
the
borough
especially
there
still
remain
some
old
inns
which
have
preserved
their
external
features
unchanged
and
which
have
escaped
alike
the
rage
for
public
improvement
and
the
encroachments
of
private
speculation
great
rambling
queer
old
places
they
are
with
galleries
and
passages
and
staircases
wide
enough
and
antiquated
enough
to
furnish
materials
for
a
hundred
ghost
stories
supposing
we
should
ever
be
reduced
to
the
lamentable
necessity
of
inventing
any
and
that
the
world
should
exist
long
enough
to
exhaust
the
innumerable
veracious
legends
connected
with
old
london
bridge
and
its
adjacent
neighbourhood
on
the
surrey
side
it
was
in
the
yard
of
one
of
these
inns
of
no
less
celebrated
a
one
than
the
white
hart
that
a
man
was
busily
employed
in
brushing
the
dirt
off
a
pair
of
boots
early
on
the
morning
succeeding
the
events
narrated
in
the
last
chapter
he
was
habited
in
a
coarse
striped
waistcoat
with
black
calico
sleeves
and
blue
glass
buttons
drab
breeches
and
leggings
a
bright
red
handkerchief
was
wound
in
a
very
loose
and
unstudied
style
round
his
neck
and
an
old
white
hat
was
carelessly
thrown
on
one
side
of
his
head
there
were
two
rows
of
boots
before
him
one
cleaned
and
the
other
dirty
and
at
every
addition
he
made
to
the
clean
row
he
paused
from
his
work
and
contemplated
its
results
with
evident
satisfaction
the
yard
presented
none
of
that
bustle
and
activity
which
are
the
usual
characteristics
of
a
large
coach
inn
three
or
four
lumbering
wagons
each
with
a
pile
of
goods
beneath
its
ample
canopy
about
the
height
of
the
window
of
an
ordinary
house
were
stowed
away
beneath
a
lofty
roof
which
extended
over
one
end
of
the
yard
and
another
which
was
probably
to
commence
its
journey
that
morning
was
drawn
out
into
the
open
space
a
double
tier
of
bedroom
galleries
with
old
clumsy
balustrades
ran
round
two
sides
of
the
straggling
area
and
a
double
row
of
bells
to
correspond
sheltered
from
the
weather
by
a
little
sloping
roof
hung
over
the
door
leading
to
the
bar
and
two
or
three
gigs
and
were
wheeled
up
under
different
little
sheds
and
and
the
occasional
heavy
tread
of
a
or
rattling
of
a
chain
at
the
farther
end
of
the
yard
announced
to
anybody
who
cared
about
the
matter
that
the
stable
lay
in
that
direction
when
we
add
that
a
few
boys
in
were
lying
asleep
on
heavy
packages
and
other
articles
that
were
scattered
about
on
heaps
of
straw
we
have
described
as
fully
as
need
be
the
general
appearance
of
the
yard
of
the
white
hart
inn
high
street
borough
on
the
particular
morning
in
question
a
loud
ringing
of
one
of
the
bells
was
followed
by
the
appearance
of
a
smart
chambermaid
in
the
upper
sleeping
gallery
who
after
tapping
at
one
of
the
doors
and
receiving
a
request
from
within
called

balustrades

with

assiduity
there

another
loud
ring
and
the
bustling
old
landlady
of

appearance
in

opposite
gallery

sam
as
he
picked

shoes

taking
a
piece

that

the
spinster
affectionately
as

stuck
the
hat
on
his
head
long
away
from
you
cruel
charmer
and
jingle
skipped
playfully
up
to
the
spinster

imprinted
a
chaste
kiss
upon

lips
and
danced
out
of

the
spinster
as
the
door
closed
after
him
rum
old
girl
said
jingle
as
he
walked
down
the
passage
it
is
painful
to
reflect
upon
the
perfidy
of
our
species
and
we
will
not
therefore
pursue
the
thread
of
jingle
s
meditations
as
he
wended
his
way
to
doctors
commons
it
will
be
sufficient
for
our
purpose
to
relate
that
escaping
the
snares
of
the
dragons
in
white
aprons
who
guard
the
entrance
to
that
enchanted
region
he
reached
the
s
office
in
safety
and
having
procured
a
highly
flattering
address
on
parchment
from
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
to
his
trusty
and
alfred
jingle
and
rachael
wardle
greeting
he
carefully
deposited
the
mystic
document
in
his
pocket
and
retraced
his
steps
in
triumph
to
the
borough
he
was
yet
on
his
way
to
the
white
hart
when
two
plump
gentleman
and
one
thin
one
entered
the
yard
and
looked
round
in
search
of
some
authorised
person
of
whom
they
could
make
a
few
inquiries
samuel
weller
happened
to
be
at
that
moment
engaged
in
burnishing
a
pair
of
painted
tops
the
personal
property
of
a
farmer
who
was
refreshing
himself
with
a
slight
lunch
of
two
or
three
pounds
of
cold
beef
and
a
pot
or
two
of
porter
after
the
fatigues
of
the
borough
market
and
to
him
the
thin
gentleman
straightway
advanced
my
friend
said
the
thin
gentleman
you
re
one
o
the
adwice
gratis
order
thought
sam
or
you
wouldn
t
be
so
wery
fond
o
me
all
at
but
he
only
said
well
my
friend
said
the
thin
gentleman
with
a
conciliatory
hem
have
you
got
many
people
stopping
here
now
pretty
busy
eh
sam
stole
a
look
at
the
inquirer
he
was
a
little
man
with
a
dark
face
and
small
restless
black
eyes
that
kept
winking
and
twinkling
on
each
side
of
his
little
inquisitive
nose
as
if
they
were
playing
a
perpetual
game
of
with
that
feature
he
was
dressed
all
in
black
with
boots
as
shiny
as
his
eyes
a
low
white
neckcloth
and
a
clean
shirt
with
a
frill
to
it
a
gold
and
seals
depended
from
his
fob
he
carried
his
black
kid
gloves
his
hands
and
not
on
them
and
as
he
spoke
thrust
his
wrists
beneath
his
coat
tails
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
was
in
the
habit
of
propounding
some
regular
posers
pretty
busy
eh
said
the
little
man
oh
wery
well
sir
replied
sam
we
shan
t
be
bankrupts
and
we
shan
t
make
our
fort
ns
we
eats
our
biled
mutton
without
capers
and
don
t
care
for
ven
ve
can
get
ah
said
the
little
man
you
re
a
wag
ain
t
you
my
eldest
brother
was
troubled
with
that
complaint
said
sam
it
may
be
catching
i
used
to
sleep
with
this
is
a
curious
old
house
of
yours
said
the
little
man
looking
round
him
if
you
d
sent
word
you
was
we
d
ha
had
it
repaired
replied
the
imperturbable
sam
the
little
man
seemed
rather
baffled
by
these
several
repulses
and
a
short
consultation
took
place
between
him
and
the
two
plump
gentlemen
at
its
conclusion
the
little
man
took
a
pinch
of
snuff
from
an
oblong
silver
box
and
was
apparently
on
the
point
of
renewing
the
conversation
when
one
of
the
plump
gentlemen
who
in
addition
to
a
benevolent
countenance
possessed
a
pair
of
spectacles
and
a
pair
of
black
gaiters
interfered
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
said
the
benevolent
gentleman
that
my
friend
here
pointing
to
the
other
plump
gentleman
will
give
you
half
a
guinea
if
you
ll
answer
one
or
two
now
my
dear
sir
my
dear
sir
said
the
little
man
pray
allow
me
my
dear
sir
the
very
first
principle
to
be
observed
in
these
cases
is
this
if
you
place
the
matter
in
the
hands
of
a
professional
man
you
must
in
no
way
interfere
in
the
progress
of
the
business
you
must
repose
implicit
confidence
in
him
really
he
turned
to
the
other
plump
gentleman
and
said
i
forget
your
friend
s
pickwick
said
wardle
for
it
was
no
other
than
that
jolly
personage
ah
pickwick
really
pickwick
my
dear
sir
excuse
me
i
shall
be
happy
to
receive
any
private
suggestions
of
yours
as
amicus
curiae
but
you
must
see
the
impropriety
of
your
interfering
with
my
conduct
in
this
case
with
such
an
ad
captandum
argument
as
the
offer
of
half
a
guinea
really
my
dear
sir
really
and
the
little
man
took
an
argumentative
pinch
of
snuff
and
looked
very
profound
my
only
wish
sir
said
pickwick
was
to
bring
this
very
unpleasant
matter
to
as
speedy
a
close
as
quite
right
quite
right
said
the
little
man
with
which
view
continued
pickwick
i
made
use
of
the
argument
which
my
experience
of
men
has
taught
me
is
the
most
likely
to
succeed
in
any
ay
ay
said
the
little
man
very
good
very
good
indeed
but
you
should
have
suggested
it
to
me
my
dear
sir
i
m
quite
certain
you
can
not
be
ignorant
of
the
extent
of
confidence
which
must
be
placed
in
professional
men
if
any
authority
can
be
necessary
on
such
a
point
my
dear
sir
let
me
refer
you
to
the
case
in
barnwell
and
never
mind
george
barnwell
interrupted
sam
who
had
remained
a
wondering
listener
during
this
short
colloquy
everybody
knows
what
sort
of
a
case
his
was
tho
it
s
always
been
my
opinion
mind
you
that
the
young
ooman
deserved
scragging
a
precious
sight
more
than
he
did
hows
ever
that
s
neither
here
nor
there
you
want
me
to
accept
of
half
a
guinea
wery
well
i
m
agreeable
i
can
t
say
no
fairer
than
that
can
i
sir
pickwick
smiled
then
the
next
question
is
what
the
devil
do
you
want
with
me
as
the
man
said
wen
he
see
the
ghost
we
want
to
know
said
wardle
now
my
dear
sir
my
dear
sir
interposed
the
busy
little
man
wardle
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
was
silent
we
want
to
know
said
the
little
man
solemnly
and
we
ask
the
question
of
you
in
order
that
we
may
not
awaken
apprehensions
inside
we
want
to
know
who
you
ve
got
in
this
house
at
present
who
there
is
in
the
house
said
sam
in
whose
mind
the
inmates
were
always
represented
by
that
particular
article
of
their
costume
which
came
under
his
immediate
superintendence
there
s
a
vooden
leg
in
number
six
there
s
a
pair
of
hessians
in
thirteen
there
s
two
pair
of
halves
in

in
the
snuggery
inside
the
bar
and
five
more
tops
in
the
nothing

said
the
little
man
stop
a
bit
replied
sam
suddenly
recollecting
himself
yes

a
pair
of
vellingtons
a
good
deal
worn
and
a
pair
o
lady
s
shoes
in
number
what
sort
of
shoes
hastily
inquired
wardle
who
together
with
pickwick
had
been
lost
in
bewilderment
at
the
singular
catalogue
of
visitors

replied
sam
any

exclaimed
wardle
by

wardle

my
dear

said
the
little
man
caution
he
drew
from
his
pocket
a
red
silk
purse
and
looked
very
hard
at
sam
as
he
drew
out
a
sovereign
sam
grinned
expressively
show
us
into
the
room
at
once
without
announcing
us
said
the
little
man
and
it
s
sam
threw
the
painted
tops
into
a
corner
and
led
the
way
through
a
dark
passage
and
up
a
wide
staircase
he
paused
at
the
end
of
a
second
passage
and
held
out
his
hand
here
it
is
whispered
the
attorney
as
he
deposited
the
money
on
the
hand
of
their
guide
the
man
stepped
forward
for
a
few
paces
followed
by
the
two
friends
and
their
legal
adviser
he
stopped
at
a
door

this
the
room
murmured
the
little
gentleman
sam
nodded
assent
old
wardle
opened
the
door
and
the
whole
three
walked
into
the
room
just
as
jingle
who
had
that
moment
returned
had
produced
the
licence
to
the
spinster
aunt
the
spinster
uttered
a
loud
shriek
and
throwing
herself
into
a
chair
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
jingle
crumpled
up
the
licence
and
thrust
it
into
his
coat
pocket
the
unwelcome
visitors
advanced
into
the
middle
of
the
room

nice
rascal

exclaimed
wardle
breathless
with
passion

in

fierce
a
tone
that
the
little

involuntarily
fell

step

replied
sam
who
had
answered
wardle
s
violent
ringing
of
the
bell
with
a
degree
of
celerity
which
must
have
appeared
marvellous
to
anybody
who
didn

know
that
his
eye
had
been
applied
to
the
outside
of
the
keyhole

and

sundry
ejaculations
of

a

little
of
this
it

the
landlady
assisted
by
a
chambermaid
proceeded
to
vinegar
the
forehead
beat
the
hands
titillate
the
nose
and
unlace
the
stays
of
the
spinster
aunt
and
to
administer
such
other
restoratives
as
are
usually
applied
by
compassionate
females
to
ladies
who
are
endeavouring
to
ferment
themselves
into
hysterics
coach
is
ready
sir
said
sam
appearing
at
the
door
come
along
cried
wardle
i
ll
carry
her
at
this
proposition
the
hysterics
came
on
with
redoubled
violence
the
landlady
was
about
to
enter
a
very
violent
protest
against
this
proceeding
and
had
already
given
vent
to
an
indignant
inquiry
whether
wardle
considered
himself
a
lord
of
the
creation
when
jingle
interposed
boots
said
he
get
me
an
stay

said
little
perker

replied
jingle
she
s
her
own
mistress

who
dares
to
take
her
away
unless
she
wishes
i
be
taken
away
murmured
the
spinster
aunt
i
wish
here
there
was
a
frightful
relapse
my
dear
sir
said
the
little
man
in
a
low
tone
taking
wardle
and
pickwick
apart
my
dear
sir
we
re
in
a
very
awkward
situation
it
s
a
distressing
case
very
i
never
knew
one
more
so
but
really
my
dear
sir
really
we
have
no
power
to
control
this
lady
s
actions
i
warned
you
before
we
came
my
dear
sir
that
there
was
nothing
to
look
to
but
a
there
was
a
short
pause
what
kind
of
compromise
would
you
recommend
inquired
pickwick
why
my
dear
sir
our
friend
s
in
an
unpleasant
position
very
much
so
we
must
be
content
to
suffer
some
pecuniary
i
ll
suffer
any
rather
than
submit
to
this
disgrace
and
let
her
fool
as
she
is
be
made
miserable
for
life
said
wardle
i
rather
think
it
can
be
done
said
the
bustling
little
man
mr
jingle
will
you
step
with
us
into
the
next
room
for
a
moment
jingle
assented
and
the
quartette
walked
into
an
empty
apartment
now
sir
said
the
little
man
as
he
carefully
closed
the
door
is
there
no
way
of
accommodating
this
matter
step
this
way
sir
for
a
moment
into
this
window
sir
where
we
can
be
alone
there
sir
there
pray
sit
down
sir
now
my
dear
sir
between
you
and
i
we
know
very
well
my
dear
sir
that
you
have
run
off
with
this
lady
for
the
sake
of
her
money

sir

t
frown
i
say
between
you
and
i
know
it
we
are
both
men
of
the
world
and
we
know
very
well
that
our
friends
here
are
not
eh
jingle
s
face
gradually
relaxed
and
something
distantly
resembling
a
wink
quivered
for
an
instant
in
his
left
eye
very
good
very
good
said
the
little
man
observing
the
impression
he
had
made
now
the
fact
is
that
beyond
a
few
hundreds
the
lady
has
little
or
nothing
till
the
death
of
her
mother
fine
old
lady
my
dear
said
jingle
briefly
but
emphatically
why
yes
said
the
attorney
with
a
slight
cough
you
are
right
my
dear
sir
she
is
rather
old
she
comes
of
an
old
family
though
my
dear
sir
old
in
every
sense
of
the
word
the
founder
of
that
family
came
into
kent
when
julius
caesar
invaded
britain
only
one
member
of
it
since
who
hasn
t
lived
to
and
he
was
beheaded
by
one
of
the
henrys
the
old
lady
is
not
now
my
dear
the
little
man
paused
and
took
a
pinch
of
snuff
well
cried
jingle
well
my
dear
sir
you
don
t
take
snuff
ah
so
much
the
better

said
jingle
again
do
you
comprehend
me
not
don
t
you
think
now
my
dear
sir
i
put
it
to
you
don
t
you
think
that
fifty
pounds

better
than
miss
wardle
and
expectation
won
t
do
not
half
enough
said
jingle
rising
nay
nay
my
dear
sir
remonstrated
the
little
attorney
seizing
him
by
the
button
good
round
sum
a
man
like
you
could
treble
it
in
no
time
great
deal
to
be
done

dear

with
a
hundred

replied
jingle
coolly
well
my
dear
sir
we
won
t

time
in
splitting
straws

the
little
man
say

said
jingle
come

the
little
man
and
down
he
sat
at
the
table
for
that
purpose
i
ll
make
it
payable
the
day
after
said
the
little
man
with
a
look
towards
wardle
and
we
can
get
the
lady
away
wardle
sullenly
nodded
assent
a
hundred
said
the
little
man
and
twenty
said
jingle
my
dear
sir
remonstrated
the
little
man
give
it
him
interposed
wardle
and
let
him
the
cheque
was
written
by
the
little
gentleman
and
pocketed
by
jingle
now
leave
this
house
instantly
said
wardle
starting
up
my
dear
sir
urged
the
little
man
and
mind
said
wardle
that
nothing
should
have
induced
me
to
make
this
compromise
not
even
a
regard
for
my
family
if
i
had
not
known
that
the
moment
you
got
any
money
in
that
pocket
of
yours
you
d
go
to
the
devil
faster
if
possible
than
you
would
without
it
my
dear
sir
urged
the
little
man
again
be
quiet
perker
resumed
wardle
leave
the
room
off
directly
said
the
unabashed
jingle
bye
bye
if
any
dispassionate
spectator
could
have
beheld
the
countenance
of
the
illustrious
man
whose
name
forms
the
leading
feature
of
the
title
of
this
work
during
the
latter
part
of
this
conversation
he
would
have
been
almost
induced
to
wonder
that
the
indignant
fire
which
flashed
from
his
eyes
did
not
melt
the
glasses
of
his
spectacles
so
majestic
was
his
wrath
his
nostrils
dilated
and
his
fists
clenched
involuntarily
as
he
heard
himself
addressed
by
the
villain
but
he
restrained
himself
did
not
pulverise
him
here
continued
the
hardened
traitor
tossing
the
licence
at
pickwick
s
feet
get
the
name
altered
take
home
the
lady
do
for
pickwick
was
a
philosopher
but
philosophers
are
only
men
in
armour
after
all
the
shaft
had
reached
him
penetrated
through
his
philosophical
harness
to
his
very
heart
in
the
frenzy
of
his
rage
he
hurled
the
inkstand
madly
forward
and
followed
it
up
himself
but
jingle
had
disappeared
and
he
found
himself
caught
in
the
arms
of
sam
hollo
said
that
eccentric
functionary
furniter
s
cheap
where
you
come
from
sir
ink
that
ere
it

wrote
your

still
sir
wot

the
use
o
runnin
arter
a
man
as
has
made
his
lucky
and
got
to
t
other
end
of
the
borough
by
this
time
pickwick
s
mind
like
those
of
all
truly
great
men
was
open
to
conviction
he
was
a
quick
and
powerful
reasoner
and
a
moment
s
reflection
sufficed
to
remind
him
of
the
impotency
of
his
rage
it
subsided
as
quickly
as
it
had
been
roused
he
panted
for
breath
and
looked
benignantly
round
upon
his
friends
shall
we
tell
the
lamentations
that
ensued
when
miss
wardle
found
herself
deserted
by
the
faithless
jingle
shall
we
extract
pickwick
s
masterly
description
of
that
heartrending
scene
his
book
blotted
with
the
tears
of
sympathising
humanity
lies
open
before
us
one
word
and
it
is
in
the
printer
s
hands
but
no
we
will
be
resolute
we
will
not
wring
the
public
bosom
with
the
delineation
of
such
suffering
slowly
and
sadly
did
the
two
friends
and
the
deserted
lady
return
next
day
in
the
muggleton
heavy
coach
dimly
and
darkly
had
the
sombre
shadows
of
a
summer
s
night
fallen
upon
all
around
when
they
again
reached
dingley
dell
and
stood
within
the
entrance
to
manor
farm
chapter
xi
involving
another
journey
and
an
antiquarian
discovery
recording
pickwick
s
determination
to
be
present
at
an
election
and
containing
a
manuscript
of
the
old
clergyman
s
a
night
of
quiet
and
repose
in
the
profound
silence
of
dingley
dell
and
an
hour
s
breathing
of
its
fresh
and
fragrant
air
on
the
ensuing
morning
completely
recovered
pickwick
from
the
effects
of
his
late
fatigue
of
body
and
anxiety
of
mind
that
illustrious
man
had
been
separated
from
his
friends
and
followers
for
two
whole
days
and
it
was
with
a
degree
of
pleasure
and
delight
which
no
common
imagination
can
adequately
conceive
that
he
stepped
forward
to
greet
winkle
and
snodgrass
as
he
encountered
those
gentlemen
on
his
return
from
his
early
walk
the
pleasure
was
mutual
for
who
could
ever
gaze
on
pickwick
s
beaming
face
without
experiencing
the
sensation
but
still
a
cloud
seemed
to
hang
over
his
companions
which
that
great
man
could
not
but
be
sensible
of
and
was
wholly
at
a
loss
to
account
for
there
was
a
mysterious
air
about
them
both
as
unusual
as
it
was
alarming
and
how
said
pickwick
when
he
had
grasped
his
followers
by
the
hand
and
exchanged
warm
salutations
of
welcome
how
is
tupman
winkle
to
whom
the
question
was
more
peculiarly
addressed
made
no
reply
he
turned
away
his
head
and
appeared
absorbed
in
melancholy
reflection
snodgrass
said
pickwick
earnestly
how
is
our
friend
he
is
not
ill
no
replied
snodgrass
and
a
tear
trembled
on
his
sentimental
eyelid
like
a
on
a
no
he
is
not
pickwick
stopped
and
gazed
on
each
of
his
friends
in
turn
winkle
snodgrass
said
pickwick
what
does
this
mean
where
is
our
friend
what
has
happened
speak
i
conjure
i
entreat
nay
i
command
you
there
was
a
solemnity
a
dignity
in
pickwick
s
manner
not
to
be
withstood
he
is
gone
said
snodgrass
gone
exclaimed
pickwick
gone
gone
repeated
snodgrass
where
ejaculated
pickwick
we
can
only
guess
from
that
communication
replied
snodgrass
taking
a
letter
from
his
pocket
and
placing
it
in
his
friend
s
hand
yesterday
morning
when
a
letter
was
received
from
wardle
stating
that
you
would
be
home
with
his
sister
at
night
the
melancholy
which
had
hung
over
our
friend
during
the
whole
of
the
previous
day
was
observed
to
increase
he
shortly
afterwards
disappeared
he
was
missing
during
the
whole
day
and
in
the
evening
this
letter
was
brought
by
the
hostler
from
the
crown
at
muggleton
it
had
been
left
in
his
charge
in
the
morning
with
a
strict
injunction
that
it
should
not
be
delivered
until
pickwick
opened
the
epistle
it
was
in
his
friend
s
and
these
were
its
contents
my
dear
pickwick
my
dear
friend
are
placed
far
beyond
the
reach
of
many
mortal
frailties
and
weaknesses
which
ordinary
people
can
not
overcome
you
do
not
know
what
it
is
at
one
blow
to
be
deserted
by
a
lovely
and
fascinating
creature
and
to
fall
a
victim
to
the
artifices
of
a
villain
who
had
the
grin
of
cunning
beneath
the
mask
of
friendship
i
hope
you
never
may
any
letter
addressed
to
me
at
the
leather
bottle
cobham
kent
will
be
forwarded
supposing
i
still
exist
i
hasten
from
the
sight
of
that
world
which
has
become
odious
to
me
should
i
hasten
from
it
altogether
pity
forgive
me
life
my
dear
pickwick
has
become
insupportable
to
me
the
spirit
which
burns
within
us
is
a
porter
s
knot
on
which
to
rest
the
heavy
load
of
worldly
cares
and
troubles
and
when
that
spirit
fails
us
the
burden
is
too
heavy
to
be
borne
we
sink
beneath
it
you
may
tell
rachael
ah
that
name
tracy
we
must
leave
this
place
directly
said
pickwick
as
he
refolded
the
note
it
would
not
have
been
decent
for
us
to
remain
here
under
any
circumstances
after
what
has
happened
and
now
we
are
bound
to
follow
in
search
of
our
and
so
saying
he
led
the
way
to
the
house
his
intention
was
rapidly
communicated
the
entreaties
to
remain
were
pressing
but
pickwick
was
inflexible
business
he
said
required
his
immediate
attendance
the
old
clergyman
was
present
you
are
not
really
going
said
he
taking
pickwick
aside
pickwick
reiterated
his
former
determination
then
here
said
the
old
gentleman
is
a
little
manuscript
which
i
had
hoped
to
have
the
pleasure
of
reading
to
you
myself
i
found
it
on
the
death
of
a
friend
of
mine
a
medical
man
engaged
in
our
county
lunatic
asylum
among
a
variety
of
papers
which
i
had
the
option
of
destroying
or
preserving
as
i
thought
proper
i
can
hardly
believe
that
the
manuscript
is
genuine
though
it
certainly
is
not
in
my
friend
s
hand
however
whether
it
be
the
genuine
production
of
a
maniac
or
founded
upon
the
ravings
of
some
unhappy
being
which
i
think
more
probable
read
it
and
judge
for
pickwick
received
the
manuscript
and
parted
from
the
benevolent
old
gentleman
with
many
expressions
of
and
esteem
it
was
a
more
difficult
task
to
take
leave
of
the
inmates
of
manor
farm
from
whom
they
had
received
so
much
hospitality
and
kindness
pickwick
kissed
the
young
ladies
we
were
going
to
say
as
if
they
were
his
own
daughters
only
as
he
might
possibly
have
infused
a
little
more
warmth
into
the
salutation
the
comparison
would
not
be
quite
appropriate
hugged
the
old
lady
with
filial
cordiality
and
patted
the
rosy
cheeks
of
the
female
servants
in
a
most
patriarchal
manner
as
he
slipped
into
the
hands
of
each
some
more
substantial
expression
of
his
approval
the
exchange
of
cordialities
with
their
fine
old
host
and
trundle
was
even
more
hearty
and
prolonged
and
it
was
not
until
snodgrass
had
been
several
times
called
for
and
at
last
emerged
from
a
dark
passage
followed
soon
after
by
emily
whose
bright
eyes
looked
unusually
dim
that
the
three
friends
were
enabled
to
tear
themselves
from
their
friendly
entertainers
many
a
backward
look
they
gave
at
the
farm
as
they
walked
slowly
away
and
many
a
kiss
did
snodgrass
waft
in
the
air
in
acknowledgment
of
something
very
like
a
lady
s
handkerchief
which
was
waved
from
one
of
the
upper
windows
until
a
turn
of
the
lane
hid
the
old
house
from
their
sight
at
muggleton
they
procured
a
conveyance
to
rochester
by
the
time
they
reached
the
place
the
violence
of
their
grief
had
sufficiently
abated
to
admit
of
their
making
a
very
excellent
early
dinner
and
having
procured
the
necessary
information
relative
to
the
road
the
three
friends
set
forward
again
in
the
afternoon
to
walk
to
cobham
a
delightful
walk
it
was
for
it
was
a
pleasant
afternoon
in
june
and
their
way
lay
through
a
deep
and
shady
wood
cooled
by
the
light
wind
which
gently
rustled
the
thick
foliage
and
enlivened
by
the
songs
of
the
birds
that
perched
upon
the
boughs
the
ivy
and
the
moss
crept
in
thick
clusters
over
the
old
trees
and
the
soft
green
turf
overspread
the
ground
like
a
silken
mat
they
emerged
upon
an
open
park
with
an
ancient
hall
displaying
the
quaint
and
picturesque
architecture
of
elizabeth
s
time
long
vistas
of
stately
oaks
and
elm
trees
appeared
on
every
side
large
herds
of
deer
were
cropping
the
fresh
grass
and
occasionally
a
startled
hare
scoured
along
the
ground
with
the
speed
of
the
shadows
thrown
by
the
light
clouds
which
swept
across
a
sunny
landscape
like
a
passing
breath
of
summer
if
this
said
pickwick
looking
about
him
if
this
were
the
place
to
which
all
who
are
troubled
with
our
friend
s
complaint
came
i
fancy
their
old
attachment
to
this
world
would
very
soon
i
think
so
too
said
winkle
and
really
added
pickwick
after
half
an
hour
s
walking
had
brought
them
to
the
village
really
for
a
misanthrope
s
choice
this
is
one
of
the
prettiest
and
most
desirable
places
of
residence
i
ever
met
in
this
opinion
also
both
winkle
and
snodgrass
expressed
their
concurrence
and
having
been
directed
to
the
leather
bottle
a
clean
and
commodious
village
the
three
travellers
entered
and
at
once
inquired
for
a
gentleman
of
the
name
of
tupman
show
the
gentlemen
into
the
parlour
tom
said
the
landlady
a
stout
country
lad
opened
a
door
at
the
end
of
the
passage
and
the
three
friends
entered
a
long
room
furnished
with
a
large
number
of
chairs
of
fantastic
shapes
and
embellished
with
a
great
variety
of
old
portraits
and
prints
of
some
antiquity
at
the
upper
end
of
the
room
was
a
table
with
a
white
cloth
upon
it
well
covered
with
a
roast
fowl
bacon
ale
and
et
ceteras
and
at
the
table
sat
tupman
looking
as
unlike
a
man
who
had
taken
his
leave
of
the
world
as
possible
on
the
entrance
of
his
friends
that
gentleman
laid
down
his
knife
and
fork
and
with
a
mournful
air
advanced
to
meet
them
i
did
not
expect
to
see
you
here
he
said
as
he
grasped
pickwick
s
hand
it
s
very
ah
said
pickwick
sitting
down
and
wiping
from
his
forehead
the
perspiration
which
the
walk
had
engendered
finish
your
dinner
and
walk
out
with
me
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
tupman
did
as
he
was
desired
and
pickwick
having
refreshed
himself
with
a
copious
draught
of
ale
waited
his
friend
s
leisure
the
dinner
was
quickly
despatched
and
they
walked
out
together
for
half
an
hour
their
forms
might
have
been
seen
pacing
the
churchyard
to
and
fro
while
pickwick
was
engaged
in
combating
his
companion
s
resolution
any
repetition
of
his
arguments
would
be
useless
for
what
language
could
convey
to
them
that
energy
and
force
which
their
great
originator
s
manner
communicated
whether
tupman
was
already
tired
of
retirement
or
whether
he
was
wholly
unable
to
resist
the
eloquent
appeal
which
was
made
to
him
matters
not
he
did
resist
it
at
last
it
mattered
little
to
him
he
said
where
he
dragged
out
the
miserable
remainder
of
his
days
and
since
his
friend
laid
so
much
stress
upon
his
humble
companionship
he
was
willing
to
share
his
pickwick
smiled
they
shook
hands
and
walked
back
to
rejoin
their
companions
it
was
at
this
moment
that
pickwick
made
that
immortal
discovery
which
has
been
the
pride
and
boast
of
his
friends
and
the
envy
of
every
antiquarian
in
this
or
any
other
country
they
had
passed
the
door
of
their
inn
and
walked
a
little
way
down
the
village
before
they
recollected
the
precise
spot
in
which
it
stood
as
they
turned
back
pickwick
s
eye
fell
upon
a
small
broken
stone
partially
buried
in
the
ground
in
front
of
a
cottage
door
he
paused
this
is
very
strange
said
pickwick
what
is
strange
inquired
tupman
staring
eagerly
at
every
object
near
him
but
the
right
one
god
bless
me
what
s
the
matter
this
last
was
an
ejaculation
of
irrepressible
astonishment
occasioned
by
seeing
pickwick
in
his
enthusiasm
for
discovery
fall
on
his
knees
before
the
little
stone
and
commence
wiping
the
dust
off
it
with
his
there
is
an
inscription
here
said
pickwick
is
it
possible
said
tupman
i
can
discern
continued
pickwick
rubbing
away
with
all
his
might
and
gazing
intently
through
his
spectacles
i
can
discern
a
cross
and
a
and
then
a
this
is
important
continued
pickwick
starting
up
this
is
some
very
old
inscription
existing
perhaps
long
before
the
ancient
in
this
place
it
must
not
be
he
tapped
at
the
cottage
door
a
labouring
man
opened
it
do
you
know
how
this
stone
came
here
my
friend
inquired
the
benevolent
pickwick
no
i
doan
t
sir
replied
the
man
civilly
it
was
here
long
afore
i
was
born
or
any
on
pickwick
glanced
triumphantly
at
his
companion
you
you
are
not
particularly
attached
to
it
i
dare
say
said
pickwick
trembling
with
anxiety
you
wouldn
t
mind
selling
it
now
ah
but
who
d
buy
it
inquired
the
man
with
an
expression
of
face
which
he
probably
meant
to
be
very
cunning
i
ll
give
you
ten
shillings
for
it
at
once
said
pickwick
if
you
would
take
it
up
for
the
astonishment
of
the
village
may
be
easily
imagined
when
the
little
stone
having
been
raised
with
one
wrench
of
a
spade
pickwick
by
dint
of
great
personal
exertion
bore
it
with
his
own
hands
to
the
inn
and
after
having
carefully
washed
it
deposited
it
on
the
table
the
exultation
and
joy
of
the
pickwickians
knew
no
bounds
when
their
patience
and
assiduity
their
washing
and
scraping
were
crowned
with
success
the
stone
was
uneven
and
broken
and
the
letters
were
straggling
and
irregular
but
the
following
fragment
of
an
inscription
was
clearly
to
be
deciphered
cross
b
i

pickwick
s
eyes
sparkled
with
delight
as
he
sat
and
gloated
over
the
treasure
he
had
discovered
he
had
attained
one
of
the
greatest
objects
of
his
ambition
in
a
county
known
to
abound
in
the
remains
of
the
early
ages
in
a
village
in
which
there
still
existed
some
memorials
of
the
olden
time
he
he
the
chairman
of
the
pickwick
club
had
discovered
a
strange
and
curious
inscription
of
unquestionable
antiquity
which
had
wholly
escaped
the
observation
of
the
many
learned
men
who
had
preceded
him
he
could
hardly
trust
the
evidence
of
his
senses
this
this
said
he
determines
me
we
return
to
town
exclaimed
his
admiring
followers
said
pickwick
this
treasure
must
be
at
once
deposited
where
it
can
be
thoroughly
investigated
and
properly
understood
i
have
another
reason
for
this
step
in
a
few
days
an
election
is
to
take
place
for
the
borough
of
eatanswill
at
which
perker
a
gentleman
whom
i
lately
met
is
the
agent
of
one
of
the
candidates
we
will
behold
and
minutely
examine
a
scene
so
interesting
to
every
we
will
was
the
animated
cry
of
three
voices
pickwick
looked
round
him
the
attachment
and
fervour
of
his
followers
lighted
up
a
glow
of
enthusiasm
within
him
he
was
their
leader
and
he
felt
it
let
us
celebrate
this
happy
meeting
with
a
convivial
glass
said
he
this
proposition
like
the
other
was
received
with
unanimous
applause
having
himself
deposited
the
important
stone
in
a
small
deal
box
purchased
from
the
landlady
for
the
purpose
he
placed
himself
in
an
at
the
head
of
the
table
and
the
evening
was
devoted
to
festivity
and
conversation
it
was
past
eleven
o
clock
a
late
hour
for
the
little
village
of
cobham
when
pickwick
retired
to
the
bedroom
which
had
been
prepared
for
his
reception
he
threw
open
the
lattice
window
and
setting
his
light
upon
the
table
fell
into
a
train
of
meditation
on
the
hurried
events
of
the
two
preceding
days
the
hour
and
the
place
were
both
favourable
to
contemplation
pickwick
was
roused
by
the
church
clock
striking
twelve
the
first
stroke
of
the
hour
sounded
solemnly
in
his
ear
but
when
the
bell
ceased
the
stillness
seemed
insupportable
he
almost
felt
as
if
he
had
lost
a
companion
he
was
nervous
and
excited
and
hastily
undressing
himself
and
placing
his
light
in
the
chimney
got
into
bed
every
one
has
experienced
that
disagreeable
state
of
mind
in
which
a
sensation
of
bodily
weariness
in
vain
contends
against
an
inability
to
sleep
it
was
pickwick
s
condition
at
this
moment
he
tossed
first
on
one
side
and
then
on
the
other
and
perseveringly
closed
his
eyes
as
if
to
coax
himself
to
slumber
it
was
of
no
use
whether
it
was
the
unwonted
exertion
he
had
undergone
or
the
heat
or
the
water
or
the
strange
bed
whatever
it
was
his
thoughts
kept
reverting
very
uncomfortably
to
the
grim
pictures
downstairs
and
the
old
stories
to
which
they
had
given
rise
in
the
course
of
the
evening
after
half
an
hour
s
tumbling
about
he
came
to
the
unsatisfactory
conclusion
that
it
was
of
no
use
trying
to
sleep
so
he
got
up
and
partially
dressed
himself
anything
he
thought
was
better
than
lying
there
fancying
all
kinds
of
horrors
he
looked
out
of
the
window
it
was
very
dark
he
walked
about
the
room
it
was
very
lonely
he
had
taken
a
few
turns
from
the
door
to
the
window
and
from
the
window
to
the
door
when
the
clergyman
s
manuscript
for
the
first
time
entered
his
head
it
was
a
good
thought
if
it
failed
to
interest
him
it
might
send
him
to
sleep
he
took
it
from
his
coat
pocket
and
drawing
a
small
table
towards
his
bedside
trimmed
the
light
put
on
his
spectacles
and
composed
himself
to
read
it
was
a
strange
handwriting
and
the
paper
was
much
soiled
and
blotted
the
title
gave
him
a
sudden
start
too
and
he
could
not
avoid
casting
a
wistful
glance
round
the
room
reflecting
on
the
absurdity
of
giving
way
to
such
feelings
however
he
trimmed
the
light
again
and
read
as
follows
a
madman
s
manuscript
yes
a
madman
s
how
that
word
would
have
struck
to
my
heart
many
years
ago
how
it
would
have
roused
the
terror
that
used
to
come
upon
me
sometimes
sending
the
blood
hissing
and
tingling
through
my
veins
till
the
cold
dew
of
fear
stood
in
large
drops
upon
my
skin
and
my
knees
knocked
together
with
fright
i
like
it
now
though
it
s
a
fine
name
show
me
the
monarch
whose
angry
frown
was
ever
feared
like
the
glare
of
a
madman
s
eye
whose
cord
and
axe
were
ever
half
so
sure
as
a
madman
s
gripe
ho
ho
it
s
a
grand
thing
to
be
mad
to
be
peeped
at
like
a
wild
lion
through
the
iron
bars
to
gnash
one
s
teeth
and
howl
through
the
long
still
night
to
the
merry
ring
of
a
heavy
chain
and
to
roll
and
twine
among
the
straw
transported
with
such
brave
music
hurrah
for
the
madhouse
oh
it
s
a
rare
place
i
remember
days
when
i
was
afraid
of
being
mad
when
i
used
to
start
from
my
sleep
and
fall
upon
my
knees
and
pray
to
be
spared
from
the
curse
of
my
race
when
i
rushed
from
the
sight
of
merriment
or
happiness
to
hide
myself
in
some
lonely
place
and
spend
the
weary
hours
in
watching
the
progress
of
the
fever
that
was
to
consume
my
brain
i
knew
that
madness
was
mixed
up
with
my
very
blood
and
the
marrow
of
my
bones
that
one
generation
had
passed
away
without
the
pestilence
appearing
among
them
and
that
i
was
the
first
in
whom
it
would
revive
i
knew
it
must
be
so
that
so
it
always
had
been
and
so
it
ever
would
be
and
when
i
cowered
in
some
obscure
corner
of
a
crowded
room
and
saw
men
whisper
and
point
and
turn
their
eyes
towards
me
i
knew
they
were
telling
each
other
of
the
doomed
madman
and
i
slunk
away
again
to
mope
in
solitude
i
did
this
for
years
long
long
years
they
were
the
nights
here
are
long
sometimes
very
long
but
they
are
nothing
to
the
restless
nights
and
dreadful
dreams
i
had
at
that
time
it
makes
me
cold
to
remember
them
large
dusky
forms
with
sly
and
jeering
faces
crouched
in
the
corners
of
the
room
and
bent
over
my
bed
at
night
tempting
me
to
madness
they
told
me
in
low
whispers
that
the
floor
of
the
old
house
in
which
my
father
died
was
stained
with
his
own
blood
shed
by
his
own
hand
in
raging
madness
i
drove
my
fingers
into
my
ears
but
they
screamed
into
my
head
till
the
room
rang
with
it
that
in
one
generation
before
him
the
madness
slumbered
but
that
his
grandfather
had
lived
for
years
with
his
hands
fettered
to
the
ground
to
prevent
his
tearing
himself
to
pieces
i
knew
they
told
the
truth
i
knew
it
well
i
had
found
it
out
years
before
though
they
had
tried
to
keep
it
from
me
ha
ha
i
was
too
cunning
for
them
madman
as
they
thought
me
at
last
it
came
upon
me
and
i
wondered
how
i
could
ever
have
feared
it
i
could
go
into
the
world
now
and
laugh
and
shout
with
the
best
among
them
i
knew
i
was
mad
but
they
did
not
even
suspect
it
how
i
used
to
hug
myself
with
delight
when
i
thought
of
the
fine
trick
i
was
playing
them
after
their
old
pointing
and
leering
when
i
was
not
mad
but
only
dreading
that
i
might
one
day
become
so
and
how
i
used
to
laugh
for
joy
when
i
was
alone
and
thought
how
well
i
kept
my
secret
and
how
quickly
my
kind
friends
would
have
fallen
from
me
if
they
had
known
the
truth
i
could
have
screamed
with
ecstasy
when
i
dined
alone
with
some
fine
roaring
fellow
to
think
how
pale
he
would
have
turned
and
how
fast
he
would
have
run
if
he
had
known
that
the
dear
friend
who
sat
close
to
him
sharpening
a
bright
glittering
knife
was
a
madman
with
all
the
power
and
half
the
will
to
plunge
it
in
his
heart
oh
it
was
a
merry
life
riches
became
mine
wealth
poured
in
upon
me
and
i
rioted
in
pleasures
enhanced
a
thousandfold
to
me
by
the
consciousness
of
my
secret
i
inherited
an
estate
the
law
the
law
itself
had
been
deceived
and
had
handed
over
disputed
thousands
to
a
madman
s
hands
where
was
the
wit
of
the
men
of
sound
mind
where
the
dexterity
of
the
lawyers
eager
to
discover
a
flaw
the
madman
s
cunning
had
overreached
them
all
i
had
money
how
i
was
courted
i
spent
it
profusely
how
i
was
praised
how
those
three
proud
overbearing
brothers
humbled
themselves
before
me
the
old
father
too
such
deference
such
respect
such
devoted
friendship
he
worshipped
me
the
old
man
had
a
daughter
and
the
young
men
a
sister
and
all
the
five
were
poor
i
was
rich
and
when
i
married
the
girl
i
saw
a
smile
of
triumph
play
upon
the
faces
of
her
needy
relatives
as
they
thought
of
their
scheme
and
their
fine
prize
it
was
for
me
to
smile
to
smile
to
laugh
outright
and
tear
my
hair
and
roll
upon
the
ground
with
shrieks
of
merriment
they
little
thought
they
had
married
her
to
a
madman
stay
if
they
had
known
it
would
they
have
saved
her
a
sister
s
happiness
against
her
husband
s
gold
the
lightest
feather
i
blow
into
the
air
against
the
gay
chain
that
ornaments
my
body
in
one
thing
i
was
deceived
with
all
my
cunning
if
i
had
not
been
though
we
madmen
are
enough
we
get
bewildered
sometimes
i
should
have
known
that
the
girl
would
rather
have
been
placed
stiff
and
cold
in
a
dull
leaden
coffin
than
borne
an
envied
bride
to
my
rich
glittering
house
i
should
have
known
that
her
heart
was
with
the
boy
whose
name
i
once
heard
her
breathe
in
her
troubled
sleep
and
that
she
had
been
sacrificed
to
me
to
relieve
the
poverty
of
the
old
man
and
the
haughty
brothers
i
don
t
remember
forms
or
faces
now
but
i
know
the
girl
was
beautiful
i
know
she
was
for
in
the
bright
moonlight
nights
when
i
start
up
from
my
sleep
and
all
is
quiet
about
me
i
see
standing
still
and
motionless
in
one
corner
of
this
cell
a
slight
and
wasted
figure
with
long
black
hair
which
streaming
down
her
back
stirs
with
no
earthly
wind
and
eyes
that
fix
their
gaze
on
me
and
never
wink
or
close
hush
the
blood
chills
at
my
heart
as
i
write
it
down
that
form
is
the
face
is
very
pale
and
the
eyes
are
glassy
bright
but
i
know
them
well
that
figure
never
moves
it
never
frowns
and
mouths
as
others
do
that
fill
this
place
sometimes
but
it
is
much
more
dreadful
to
me
even
than
the
spirits
that
tempted
me
many
years
ago
it
comes
fresh
from
the
grave
and
is
so
very
for
nearly
a
year
i
saw
that
face
grow
paler
for
nearly
a
year
i
saw
the
tears
steal
down
the
mournful
cheeks
and
never
knew
the
cause
i
found
it
out
at
last
though
they
could
not
keep
it
from
me
long
she
had
never
liked
me
i
had
never
thought
she
did
she
despised
my
wealth
and
hated
the
splendour
in
which
she
lived
but
i
had
not
expected
that
she
loved
another
this
i
had
never
thought
of
strange
feelings
came
over
me
and
thoughts
forced
upon
me
by
some
secret
power
whirled
round
and
round
my
brain
i
did
not
hate
her
though
i
hated
the
boy
she
still
wept
for
i
pitied
yes
i
pitied
the
wretched
life
to
which
her
cold
and
selfish
relations
had
doomed
her
i
knew
that
she
could
not
live
long
but
the
thought
that
before
her
death
she
might
give
birth
to
some
being
destined
to
hand
down
madness
to
its
offspring
determined
me
i
resolved
to
kill
her
for
many
weeks
i
thought
of
poison
and
then
of
drowning
and
then
of
fire
a
fine
sight
the
grand
house
in
flames
and
the
madman
s
wife
smouldering
away
to
cinders
think
of
the
jest
of
a
large
reward
too
and
of
some
sane
man
swinging
in
the
wind
for
a
deed
he
never
did
and
all
through
a
madman
s
cunning
i
thought
often
of
this
but
i
gave
it
up
at
last
oh
the
pleasure
of
stropping
the
razor
day
after
day
feeling
the
sharp
edge
and
thinking
of
the
gash
one
stroke
of
its
thin
bright
edge
would
make
at
last
the
old
spirits
who
had
been
with
me
so
often
before
whispered
in
my
ear
that
the
time
was
come
and
thrust
the
open
razor
into
my
hand
i
grasped
it
firmly
rose
softly
from
the
bed
and
leaned
over
my
sleeping
wife
her
face
was
buried
in
her
hands
i
withdrew
them
softly
and
they
fell
listlessly
on
her
bosom
she
had
been
weeping
for
the
traces
of
the
tears
were
still
wet
upon
her
cheek
her
face
was
calm
and
placid
and
even
as
i
looked
upon
it
a
tranquil
smile
lighted
up
her
pale
features
i
laid
my
hand
softly
on
her
shoulder
she
started
it
was
only
a
passing
dream
i
leaned
forward
again
she
screamed
and
woke
one
motion
of
my
hand
and
she
would
never
again
have
uttered
cry
or
sound
but
i
was
startled
and
drew
back
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
mine
i
knew
not
how
it
was
but
they
cowed
and
frightened
me
and
i
quailed
beneath
them
she
rose
from
the
bed
still
gazing
fixedly
and
steadily
on
me
i
trembled
the
razor
was
in
my
hand
but
i
could
not
move
she
made
towards
the
door
as
she
neared
it
she
turned
and
withdrew
her
eyes
from
my
face
the
spell
was
broken
i
bounded
forward
and
clutched
her
by
the
arm
uttering
shriek
upon
shriek
she
sank
upon
the
ground
now
i
could
have
killed
her
without
a
struggle
but
the
house
was
alarmed
i
heard
the
tread
of
footsteps
on
the
stairs
i
replaced
the
razor
in
its
usual
drawer
unfastened
the
door
and
called
loudly
for
assistance
they
came
and
raised
her
and
placed
her
on
the
bed
she
lay
bereft
of
animation
for
hours
and
when
life
look
and
speech
returned
her
senses
had
deserted
her
and
she
raved
wildly
and
furiously
doctors
were
called
in
great
men
who
rolled
up
to
my
door
in
easy
carriages
with
fine
horses
and
gaudy
servants
they
were
at
her
bedside
for
weeks
they
had
a
great
meeting
and
consulted
together
in
low
and
solemn
voices
in
another
room
one
the
cleverest
and
most
celebrated
among
them
took
me
aside
and
bidding
me
prepare
for
the
worst
told
me
me
the
madman
that
my
wife
was
mad
he
stood
close
beside
me
at
an
open
window
his
eyes
looking
in
my
face
and
his
hand
laid
upon
my
arm
with
one
effort
i
could
have
hurled
him
into
the
street
beneath
it
would
have
been
rare
sport
to
have
done
it
but
my
secret
was
at
stake
and
i
let
him
go
a
few
days
after
they
told
me
i
must
place
her
under
some
restraint
i
must
provide
a
keeper
for
her
i
i
went
into
the
open
fields
where
none
could
hear
me
and
laughed
till
the
air
resounded
with
my
shouts
she
died
next
day
the
old
man
followed
her
to
the
grave
and
the
proud
brothers
dropped
a
tear
over
the
insensible
corpse
of
her
whose
sufferings
they
had
regarded
in
her
lifetime
with
muscles
of
iron
all
this
was
food
for
my
secret
mirth
and
i
laughed
behind
the
white
handkerchief
which
i
held
up
to
my
face
as
we
rode
home
till
the
tears
came
into
my
eyes
but
though
i
had
carried
my
object
and
killed
her
i
was
restless
and
disturbed
and
i
felt
that
before
long
my
secret
must
be
known
i
could
not
hide
the
wild
mirth
and
joy
which
boiled
within
me
and
made
me
when
i
was
alone
at
home
jump
up
and
beat
my
hands
together
and
dance
round
and
round
and
roar
aloud
when
i
went
out
and
saw
the
busy
crowds
hurrying
about
the
streets
or
to
the
theatre
and
heard
the
sound
of
music
and
beheld
the
people
dancing
i
felt
such
glee
that
i
could
have
rushed
among
them
and
torn
them
to
pieces
limb
from
limb
and
howled
in
transport
but
i
ground
my
teeth
and
struck
my
feet
upon
the
floor
and
drove
my
sharp
nails
into
my
hands
i
kept
it
down
and
no
one
knew
i
was
a
madman
yet
i
remember
though
it
s
one
of
the
last
things
i
can
remember
for
now
i
mix
up
realities
with
my
dreams
and
having
so
much
to
do
and
being
always
hurried
here
have
no
time
to
separate
the
two
from
some
strange
confusion
in
which
they
get
involved
i
remember
how
i
let
it
out
at
last
ha
ha
i
think
i
see
their
frightened
looks
now
and
feel
the
ease
with
which
i
flung
them
from
me
and
dashed
my
clenched
fist
into
their
white
faces
and
then
flew
like
the
wind
and
left
them
screaming
and
shouting
far
behind
the
strength
of
a
giant
comes
upon
me
when
i
think
of
it
there
see
how
this
iron
bar
bends
beneath
my
furious
wrench
i
could
snap
it
like
a
twig
only
there
are
long
galleries
here
with
many
doors
i
don
t
think
i
could
find
my
way
along
them
and
even
if
i
could
i
know
there
are
iron
gates
below
which
they
keep
locked
and
barred
they
know
what
a
clever
madman
i
have
been
and
they
are
proud
to
have
me
here
to
show
let
me
see
yes
i
had
been
out
it
was
late
at
night
when
i
reached
home
and
found
the
proudest
of
the
three
proud
brothers
waiting
to
see
me
urgent
business
he
said
i
recollect
it
well
i
hated
that
man
with
all
a
madman
s
hate
many
and
many
a
time
had
my
fingers
longed
to
tear
him
they
told
me
he
was
there
i
ran
swiftly
upstairs
he
had
a
word
to
say
to
me
i
dismissed
the
servants
it
was
late
and
we
were
alone
together
for
the
first
time
i
kept
my
eyes
carefully
from
him
at
first
for
i
knew
what
he
little
thought
and
i
gloried
in
the
knowledge
that
the
light
of
madness
gleamed
from
them
like
fire
we
sat
in
silence
for
a
few
minutes
he
spoke
at
last
my
recent
dissipation
and
strange
remarks
made
so
soon
after
his
sister
s
death
were
an
insult
to
her
memory
coupling
together
many
circumstances
which
had
at
first
escaped
his
observation
he
thought
i
had
not
treated
her
well
he
wished
to
know
whether
he
was
right
in
inferring
that
i
meant
to
cast
a
reproach
upon
her
memory
and
a
disrespect
upon
her
family
it
was
due
to
the
uniform
he
wore
to
demand
this
explanation
this
man
had
a
commission
in
the
army
a
commission
purchased
with
my
money
and
his
sister
s
misery
this
was
the
man
who
had
been
foremost
in
the
plot
to
ensnare
me
and
grasp
my
wealth
this
was
the
man
who
had
been
the
main
instrument
in
forcing
his
sister
to
wed
me
well
knowing
that
her
heart
was
given
to
that
puling
boy
due
to
his
uniform
the
livery
of
his
degradation
i
turned
my
eyes
upon
him
i
could
not
help
it
but
i
spoke
not
a
word
i
saw
the
sudden
change
that
came
upon
him
beneath
my
gaze
he
was
a
bold
man
but
the
colour
faded
from
his
face
and
he
drew
back
his
chair
i
dragged
mine
nearer
to
him
and
i
laughed
i
was
very
merry
then
i
saw
him
shudder
i
felt
the
madness
rising
within
me
he
was
afraid
of
me
you
were
very
fond
of
your
sister
when
she
was
alive
i
he
looked
uneasily
round
him
and
i
saw
his
hand
grasp
the
back
of
his
chair
but
he
said
nothing
you
villain
said
i
i
found
you
out
i
discovered
your
hellish
plots
against
me
i
know
her
heart
was
fixed
on
some
one
else
before
you
compelled
her
to
marry
me
i
know
it
i
know
he
jumped
suddenly
from
his
chair
brandished
it
aloft
and
bid
me
stand
back
for
i
took
care
to
be
getting
closer
to
him
all
the
time
i
spoke
i
screamed
rather
than
talked
for
i
felt
tumultuous
passions
eddying
through
my
veins
and
the
old
spirits
whispering
and
taunting
me
to
tear
his
heart
out
damn
you
said
i
starting
up
and
rushing
upon
him
i
killed
her
i
am
a
madman
down
with
you
blood
blood
i
will
have
it
i
turned
aside
with
one
blow
the
chair
he
hurled
at
me
in
his
terror
and
closed
with
him
and
with
a
heavy
crash
we
rolled
upon
the
floor
together
it
was
a
fine
struggle
that
for
he
was
a
tall
strong
man
fighting
for
his
life
and
i
a
powerful
madman
thirsting
to
destroy
him
i
knew
no
strength
could
equal
mine
and
i
was
right
right
again
though
a
madman
his
struggles
grew
fainter
i
knelt
upon
his
chest
and
clasped
his
brawny
throat
firmly
with
both
hands
his
face
grew
purple
his
eyes
were
starting
from
his
head
and
with
protruded
tongue
he
seemed
to
mock
me
i
squeezed
the
tighter
the
door
was
suddenly
burst
open
with
a
loud
noise
and
a
crowd
of
people
rushed
forward
crying
aloud
to
each
other
to
secure
the
madman
my
secret
was
out
and
my
only
struggle
now
was
for
liberty
and
freedom
i
gained
my
feet
before
a
hand
was
on
me
threw
myself
among
my
assailants
and
cleared
my
way
with
my
strong
arm
as
if
i
bore
a
hatchet
in
my
hand
and
hewed
them
down
before
me
i
gained
the
door
dropped
over
the
banisters
and
in
an
instant
was
in
the
street
straight
and
swift
i
ran
and
no
one
dared
to
stop
me
i
heard
the
noise
of
the
feet
behind
and
redoubled
my
speed
it
grew
fainter
and
fainter
in
the
distance
and
at
length
died
away
altogether
but
on
i
bounded
through
marsh
and
rivulet
over
fence
and
wall
with
a
wild
shout
which
was
taken
up
by
the
strange
beings
that
flocked
around
me
on
every
side
and
swelled
the
sound
till
it
pierced
the
air
i
was
borne
upon
the
arms
of
demons
who
swept
along
upon
the
wind
and
bore
down
bank
and
hedge
before
them
and
spun
me
round
and
round
with
a
rustle
and
a
speed
that
made
my
head
swim
until
at
last
they
threw
me
from
them
with
a
violent
shock
and
i
fell
heavily
upon
the
earth
when
i
woke
i
found
myself
here
here
in
this
gray
cell
where
the
sunlight
seldom
comes
and
the
moon
steals
in
in
rays
which
only
serve
to
show
the
dark
shadows
about
me
and
that
silent
figure
in
its
old
corner
when
i
lie
awake
i
can
sometimes
hear
strange
shrieks
and
cries
from
distant
parts
of
this
large
place
what
they
are
i
know
not
but
they
neither
come
from
that
pale
form
nor
does
it
regard
them
for
from
the
first
shades
of
dusk
till
the
earliest
light
of
morning
it
still
stands
motionless
in
the
same
place
listening
to
the
music
of
my
iron
chain
and
watching
my
gambols
on
my
straw
at
the
end
of
the
manuscript
was
written
in
another
hand
this
note
the
unhappy
man
whose
ravings
are
recorded
above
was
a
melancholy
instance
of
the
baneful
results
of
energies
misdirected
in
early
life
and
excesses
prolonged
until
their
consequences
could
never
be
repaired
the
thoughtless
riot
dissipation
and
debauchery
of
his
younger
days
produced
fever
and
delirium
the
first
effects
of
the
latter
was
the
strange
delusion
founded
upon
a
medical
theory
strongly
contended
for
by
some
and
as
strongly
contested
by
others
that
an
hereditary
madness
existed
in
his
family
this
produced
a
settled
gloom
which
in
time
developed
a
morbid
insanity
and
finally
terminated
in
raving
madness
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
the
events
he
detailed
though
distorted
in
the
description
by
his
diseased
imagination
really
happened
it
is
only
matter
of
wonder
to
those
who
were
acquainted
with
the
vices
of
his
early
career
that
his
passions
when
no
longer
controlled
by
reason
did
not
lead
him
to
the
commission
of
still
more
frightful
deeds
pickwick
s
candle
was
just
expiring
in
the
socket
as
he
concluded
the
perusal
of
the
old
clergyman
s
manuscript
and
when
the
light
went
suddenly
out
without
any
previous
flicker
by
way
of
warning
it
communicated
a
very
considerable
start
to
his
excited
frame
hastily
throwing
off
such
articles
of
clothing
as
he
had
put
on
when
he
rose
from
his
uneasy
bed
and
casting
a
fearful
glance
around
he
once
more
scrambled
hastily
between
the
sheets
and
soon
fell
fast
asleep
the
sun
was
shining
brilliantly
into
his
chamber
when
he
awoke
and
the
morning
was
far
advanced
the
gloom
which
had
oppressed
him
on
the
previous
night
had
disappeared
with
the
dark
shadows
which
shrouded
the
landscape
and
his
thoughts
and
feelings
were
as
light
and
gay
as
the
morning
itself
after
a
hearty
breakfast
the
four
gentlemen
sallied
forth
to
walk
to
gravesend
followed
by
a
man
bearing
the
stone
in
its
deal
box
they
reached
the
town
about
one
o
clock
their
luggage
they
had
directed
to
be
forwarded
to
the
city
from
rochester
and
being
fortunate
enough
to
secure
places
on
the
outside
of
a
coach
arrived
in
london
in
sound
health
and
spirits
on
that
same
afternoon
the
next
three
or
four
days
were
occupied
with
the
preparations
which
were
necessary
for
their
journey
to
the
borough
of
eatanswill
as
any
references
to
that
most
important
undertaking
demands
a
separate
chapter
we
may
devote
the
few
lines
which
remain
at
the
close
of
this
to
narrate
with
great
brevity
the
history
of
the
antiquarian
discovery
it
appears
from
the
transactions
of
the
club
then
that
pickwick
lectured
upon
the
discovery
at
a
general
club
meeting
convened
on
the
night
succeeding
their
return
and
entered
into
a
variety
of
ingenious
and
erudite
speculations
on
the
meaning
of
the
inscription
it
also
appears
that
a
skilful
artist
executed
a
faithful
delineation
of
the
curiosity
which
was
engraven
on
stone
and
presented
to
the
royal
antiquarian
society
and
other
learned
bodies
that
and
jealousies
without
number
were
created
by
rival
controversies
which
were
penned
upon
the
subject
and
that
pickwick
himself
wrote
a
pamphlet
containing
pages
of
very
small
print
and
different
readings
of
the
inscription
that
three
old
gentlemen
cut
off
their
eldest
sons
with
a
shilling
for
presuming
to
doubt
the
antiquity
of
the
fragment
and
that
one
enthusiastic
individual
cut
himself
off
prematurely
in
despair
at
being
unable
to
fathom
its
meaning
that
pickwick
was
elected
an
honorary
member
of
seventeen
native
and
foreign
societies
for
making
the
discovery
that
none
of
the
seventeen
could
make
anything
of
it
but
that
all
the
seventeen
agreed
it
was
very
extraordinary
blotton
indeed
and
the
name
will
be
doomed
to
the
undying
contempt
of
those
who
cultivate
the
mysterious
and
the
sublime
blotton
we
say
with
the
doubt
and
cavilling
peculiar
to
vulgar
minds
presumed
to
state
a
view
of
the
case
as
degrading
as
ridiculous
blotton
with
a
mean
desire
to
tarnish
the
lustre
of
the
immortal
name
of
pickwick
actually
undertook
a
journey
to
cobham
in
person
and
on
his
return
sarcastically
observed
in
an
oration
at
the
club
that
he
had
seen
the
man
from
whom
the
stone
was
purchased
that
the
man
presumed
the
stone
to
be
ancient
but
solemnly
denied
the
antiquity
of
the
inscription
inasmuch
as
he
represented
it
to
have
been
rudely
carved
by
himself
in
an
idle
mood
and
to
display
letters
intended
to
bear
neither
more
or
less
than
the
simple
construction
of
bill
stumps
his
mark
and
that
mr
stumps
being
little
in
the
habit
of
original
composition
and
more
accustomed
to
be
guided
by
the
sound
of
words
than
by
the
strict
rules
of
orthography
had
omitted
the
concluding
l
of
his
christian
name
the
pickwick
club
as
might
have
been
expected
from
so
enlightened
an
institution
received
this
statement
with
the
contempt
it
deserved
expelled
the
presumptuous
and
blotton
from
the
society
and
voted
pickwick
a
pair
of
gold
spectacles
in
token
of
their
confidence
and
approbation
in
return
for
which
pickwick
caused
a
portrait
of
himself
to
be
painted
and
hung
up
in
the
club
room
blotton
was
ejected
but
not
conquered
he
also
wrote
a
pamphlet
addressed
to
the
seventeen
learned
societies
native
and
foreign
containing
a
repetition
of
the
statement
he
had
already
made
and
rather
more
than
half
intimating
his
opinion
that
the
seventeen
learned
societies
were
so
many
hereupon
the
virtuous
indignation
of
the
seventeen
learned
societies
being
roused
several
fresh
pamphlets
appeared
the
foreign
learned
societies
corresponded
with
the
native
learned
societies
the
native
learned
societies
translated
the
pamphlets
of
the
foreign
learned
societies
into
english
the
foreign
learned
societies
translated
the
pamphlets
of
the
native
learned
societies
into
all
sorts
of
languages
and
thus
commenced
that
celebrated
scientific
discussion
so
well
known
to
all
men
as
the
pickwick
controversy
but
this
base
attempt
to
injure
pickwick
recoiled
upon
the
head
of
its
calumnious
author
the
seventeen
learned
societies
unanimously
voted
the
presumptuous
blotton
an
ignorant
meddler
and
forthwith
set
to
work
upon
more
treatises
than
ever
and
to
this
day
the
stone
remains
an
illegible
monument
of
pickwick
s
greatness
and
a
lasting
trophy
to
the
littleness
of
his
enemies
chapter
xii
descriptive
of
a
very
important
proceeding
on
the
part
of
pickwick
no
less
an
epoch
in
his
life
than
in
this
history
pickwick
s
apartments
in
goswell
street
although
on
a
limited
scale
were
not
only
of
a
very
neat
and
comfortable
description
but
peculiarly
adapted
for
the
residence
of
a
man
of
his
genius
and
observation
his
was
the
front
his
bedroom
the
front
and
thus
whether
he
were
sitting
at
his
desk
in
his
parlour
or
standing
before
the
in
his
dormitory
he
had
an
equal
opportunity
of
contemplating
human
nature
in
all
the
numerous
phases
it
exhibits
in
that
not
more
populous
than
popular
thoroughfare
his
landlady
bardell
the
relict
and
sole
executrix
of
a
deceased
officer
was
a
comely
woman
of
bustling
manners
and
agreeable
appearance
with
a
natural
genius
for
cooking
improved
by
study
and
long
practice
into
an
exquisite
talent
there
were
no
children
no
servants
no
fowls
the
only
other
inmates
of
the
house
were
a
large
man
and
a
small
boy
the
first
a
lodger
the
second
a
production
of
bardell
s
the
large
man
was
always
home
precisely
at
ten
o
clock
at
night
at
which
hour
he
regularly
condensed
himself
into
the
limits
of
a
dwarfish
french
bedstead
in
the
back
parlour
and
the
infantine
sports
and
gymnastic
exercises
of
master
bardell
were
exclusively
confined
to
the
neighbouring
pavements
and
gutters
cleanliness
and
quiet
reigned
throughout
the
house
and
in
it
pickwick
s
will
was
law
to
any
one
acquainted
with
these
points
of
the
domestic
economy
of
the
establishment
and
conversant
with
the
admirable
regulation
of
pickwick
s
mind
his
appearance
and
behaviour
on
the
morning
previous
to
that
which
had
been
fixed
upon
for
the
journey
to
eatanswill
would
have
been
most
mysterious
and
unaccountable
he
paced
the
room
to
and
fro
with
hurried
steps
popped
his
head
out
of
the
window
at
intervals
of
about
three
minutes
each
constantly
referred
to
his
watch
and
exhibited
many
other
manifestations
of
impatience
very
unusual
with
him
it
was
evident
that
something
of
great
importance
was
in
contemplation
but
what
that
something
was
not
even
bardell
had
been
enabled
to
discover
mrs
bardell
said
pickwick
at
last
as
that
amiable
female
approached
the
termination
of
a
prolonged
dusting
of
the
apartment
sir
said
bardell
your
little
boy
is
a
very
long
time
why
it
s
a
good
long
way
to
the
borough
sir
remonstrated
bardell
ah
said
pickwick
very
true
so
it
pickwick
relapsed
into
silence
and
bardell
resumed
her
dusting
mrs
bardell
said
pickwick
at
the
expiration
of
a
few
minutes
sir
said
bardell
again
do
you
think
it
a
much
greater
expense
to
keep
two
people
than
to
keep
one
la
pickwick
said
bardell
colouring
up
to
the
very
border
of
her
cap
as
she
fancied
she
observed
a
species
of
matrimonial
twinkle
in
the
eyes
of
her
lodger
la
pickwick
what
a
question
well
but
do
you
inquired
pickwick
that
depends
said
bardell
approaching
the
duster
very
near
to
pickwick
s
elbow
which
was
planted
on
the
table
that
depends
a
good
deal
upon
the
person
you
know
pickwick
and
whether
it
s
a
saving
and
careful
person
that
s
very
true
said
pickwick
but
the
person
i
have
in
my
eye
here
he
looked
very
hard
at
bardell
i
think
possesses
these
qualities
and
has
moreover
a
considerable
knowledge
of
the
world
and
a
great
deal
of
sharpness
bardell
which
may
be
of
material
use
to
la
pickwick
said
bardell
the
crimson
rising
to
her
border
again
i
do
said
pickwick
growing
energetic
as
was
his
wont
in
speaking
of
a
subject
which
interested
him
i
do
indeed
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
bardell
i
have
made
up
my
dear
me
sir
exclaimed
bardell
you
ll
think
it
very
strange
now
said
the
amiable
pickwick
with
a
glance
at
his
companion
that
i
never
consulted
you
about
this
matter
and
never
even
mentioned
it
till
i
sent
your
little
boy
out
this
morning
eh
bardell
could
only
reply
by
a
look
she
had
long
worshipped
pickwick
at
a
distance
but
here
she
was
all
at
once
raised
to
a
pinnacle
to
which
her
wildest
and
most
extravagant
hopes
had
never
dared
to
aspire
pickwick
was
going
to
propose
a
deliberate
plan
too
sent
her
little
boy
to
the
borough
to
get
him
out
of
the
way
how
thoughtful
how
considerate
well
said
pickwick
what
do
you
think
oh
pickwick
said
bardell
trembling
with
agitation
you
re
very
kind
it
ll
save
you
a
good
deal
of
trouble
won
t
it
said
pickwick
oh
i
never
thought
anything
of
the
trouble
sir
replied
bardell
and
of
course
i
should
take
more
trouble
to
please
you
then
than
ever
but
it
is
so
kind
of
you
pickwick
to
have
so
much
consideration
for
my
ah
to
be
sure
said
pickwick
i
never
thought
of
that
when
i
am
in
town
you
ll
always
have
somebody
to
sit
with
you
to
be
sure
so
you
i
am
sure
i
ought
to
be
a
very
happy
woman
said
bardell
and
your
little
boy
said
pickwick
bless
his
heart
interposed
bardell
with
a
maternal
sob
he
too
will
have
a
companion
resumed
pickwick
a
lively
one
who
ll
teach
him
i
ll
be
bound
more
tricks
in
a
week
than
he
would
ever
learn
in
a
and
pickwick
smiled
placidly
oh
you
dear
said
bardell
pickwick
started
oh
you
kind
good
playful
dear
said
bardell
and
without
more
ado
she
rose
from
her
chair
and
flung
her
arms
round
pickwick
s
neck
with
a
cataract
of
tears
and
a
chorus
of
sobs
bless
my
soul
cried
the
astonished
pickwick
mrs
bardell
my
good
woman
dear
me
what
a
situation
pray
mrs
bardell
don
t
if
anybody
should
come
oh
let
them
come
exclaimed
bardell
frantically
i
ll
never
leave
you
dear
kind
good
soul
and
with
these
words
bardell
clung
the
tighter
mercy
upon
me
said
pickwick
struggling
violently
i
hear
somebody
coming
up
the
stairs
don
t
don
t
there
s
a
good
creature
don
but
entreaty
and
remonstrance
were
alike
unavailing
for
bardell
had
fainted
in
pickwick
s
arms
and
before
he
could
gain
time
to
deposit
her
on
a
chair
master
bardell
entered
the
room
ushering
in
tupman
winkle
and
snodgrass
pickwick
was
struck
motionless
and
speechless
he
stood
with
his
lovely
burden
in
his
arms
gazing
vacantly
on
the
countenances
of
his
friends
without
the
slightest
attempt
at
recognition
or
explanation
they
in
their
turn
stared
at
him
and
master
bardell
in
his
turn
stared
at
everybody
the
astonishment
of
the
pickwickians
was
so
absorbing
and
the
perplexity
of
pickwick
was
so
extreme
that
they
might
have
remained
in
exactly
the
same
relative
situations
until
the
suspended
animation
of
the
lady
was
restored
had
it
not
been
for
a
most
beautiful
and
touching
expression
of
filial
affection
on
the
part
of
her
youthful
son
clad
in
a
tight
suit
of
corduroy
spangled
with
brass
buttons
of
a
very
considerable
size
he
at
first
stood
at
the
door
astounded
and
uncertain
but
by
degrees
the
impression
that
his
mother
must
have
suffered
some
personal
damage
pervaded
his
partially
developed
mind
and
considering
pickwick
as
the
aggressor
he
set
up
an
appalling
and
kind
of
howling
and
butting
forward
with
his
head
commenced
assailing
that
immortal
gentleman
about
the
back
and
legs
with
such
blows
and
pinches
as
the
strength
of
his
arm
and
the
violence
of
his
excitement
allowed
take
this
little
villain
away
said
the
agonised
pickwick
he
s
what
is
the
matter
said
the
three
pickwickians
i
don
t
know
replied
pickwick
pettishly
take
away
the
here
winkle
carried
the
interesting
boy
screaming
and
struggling
to
the
farther
end
of
the
apartment
now
help
me
lead
this
woman
oh
i
am
better
now
said
bardell
faintly
let
me
lead
you
downstairs
said
the
tupman
thank
you
sir
thank
you
exclaimed
bardell
hysterically
and
downstairs
she
was
led
accordingly
accompanied
by
her
affectionate
son
i
can
not
conceive
said
pickwick
when
his
friend
returned
i
can
not
conceive
what
has
been
the
matter
with
that
woman
i
had
merely
announced
to
her
my
intention
of
keeping
a
when
she
fell
into
the
extraordinary
paroxysm
in
which
you
found
her
very
extraordinary
very
said
his
three
friends
placed
me
in
such
an
extremely
awkward
situation
continued
pickwick
very
was
the
reply
of
his
followers
as
they
coughed
slightly
and
looked
dubiously
at
each
other
this
behaviour
was
not
lost
upon
pickwick
he
remarked
their
incredulity
they
evidently
suspected
him
there
is
a
man
in
the
passage
now
said
tupman
it
s
the
man
i
spoke
to
you
about
said
pickwick
i
sent
for
him
to
the
borough
this
morning
have
the
goodness
to
call
him
up
snodgrass
did
as
he
was
desired
and
samuel
weller
forthwith
presented
himself
oh
you
remember
me
i
suppose
said
pickwick
i
should
think
so
replied
sam
with
a
patronising
wink
queer
start
that
ere
but
he
was
one
too
many
for
you
warn
t
he
up
to
snuff
and
a
pinch
or
two
over
eh
never
mind
that
matter
now
said
pickwick
hastily
i
want
to
speak
to
you
about
something
else
sit
thank
ee
sir
said
sam
and
down
he
sat
without
further
bidding
having
previously
deposited
his
old
white
hat
on
the
landing
outside
the
door
tain
t
a
wery
good
un
to
look
at
said
sam
but
it
s
an
astonishin
un
to
wear
and
afore
the
brim
went
it
was
a
wery
handsome
tile
hows
ever
it
s
lighter
without
it
that
s
one
thing
and
every
hole
lets
in
some
air
that
s
another
wentilation
gossamer
i
calls
on
the
delivery
of
this
sentiment
weller
smiled
agreeably
upon
the
assembled
pickwickians
now
with
regard
to
the
matter
on
which
i
with
the
concurrence
of
these
gentlemen
sent
for
you
said
pickwick
that
s
the
pint
sir
interposed
sam
out
vith
it
as
the
father
said
to
his
child
when
he
swallowed
a
we
want
to
know
in
the
first
place
said
pickwick
whether
you
have
any
reason
to
be
discontented
with
your
present
afore
i
answers
that
ere
question
gen
l
m
n
replied
weller
i
should
like
to
know
in
the
first
place
whether
you
re
to
purwide
me
with
a
better
a
sunbeam
of
placid
benevolence
played
on
pickwick
s
features
as
he
said
i
have
half
made
up
my
mind
to
engage
you
have
you
though
said
sam
pickwick
nodded
in
the
affirmative
wages
inquired
sam
twelve
pounds
a
year
replied
pickwick
clothes
two
work
to
attend
upon
me
and
travel
about
with
me
and
these
gentlemen
take
the
bill
down
said
sam
emphatically
i
m
let
to
a
single
gentleman
and
the
terms
is
agreed
you
accept
the
situation
inquired
pickwick
cert
nly
replied
sam
if
the
clothes
fits
me
half
as
well
as
the
place
they
ll
you
can
get
a
character
of
course
said
pickwick
ask
the
landlady
o
the
white
hart
about
that
sir
replied
sam
can
you
come
this
evening
i
ll
get
into
the
clothes
this
minute
if
they
re
here
said
sam
with
great
alacrity
call
at
eight
this
evening
said
pickwick
and
if
the
inquiries
are
satisfactory
they
shall
be
with
the
single
exception
of
one
amiable
indiscretion
in
which
an
assistant
housemaid
had
equally
participated
the
history
of
weller
s
conduct
was
so
very
blameless
that
pickwick
felt
fully
justified
in
closing
the
engagement
that
very
evening
with
the
promptness
and
energy
which
characterised
not
only
the
public
proceedings
but
all
the
private
actions
of
this
extraordinary
man
he
at
once
led
his
new
attendant
to
one
of
those
convenient
emporiums
where
gentlemen
s
new
and
clothes
are
provided
and
the
troublesome
and
inconvenient
formality
of
measurement
dispensed
with
and
before
night
had
closed
in
weller
was
furnished
with
a
grey
coat
with
the
button
a
black
hat
with
a
cockade
to
it
a
pink
striped
waistcoat
light
breeches
and
gaiters
and
a
variety
of
other
necessaries
too
numerous
to
recapitulate
well
said
that
individual
as
he
took
his
seat
on
the
outside
of
the
eatanswill
coach
next
morning
i
wonder
whether
i
m
meant
to
be
a
footman
or
a
groom
or
a
gamekeeper
or
a
seedsman
i
looks
like
a
sort
of
compo
of
every
one
on
em
never
mind
there
s
a
change
of
air
plenty
to
see
and
little
to
do
and
all
this
suits
my
complaint
uncommon
so
long
life
to
the
pickvicks
says
i
chapter
xiii
some
account
of
eatanswill
of
the
state
of
parties
therein
and
of
the
election
of
a
member
to
serve
in
parliament
for
that
ancient
loyal
and
patriotic
borough
we
will
frankly
acknowledge
that
up
to
the
period
of
our
being
first
immersed
in
the
voluminous
papers
of
the
pickwick
club
we
had
never
heard
of
eatanswill
we
will
with
equal
candour
admit
that
we
have
in
vain
searched
for
proof
of
the
actual
existence
of
such
a
place
at
the
present
day
knowing
the
deep
reliance
to
be
placed
on
every
note
and
statement
of
pickwick
s
and
not
presuming
to
set
up
our
recollection
against
the
recorded
declarations
of
that
great
man
we
have
consulted
every
authority
bearing
upon
the
subject
to
which
we
could
possibly
refer
we
have
traced
every
name
in
schedules
a
and
b
without
meeting
with
that
of
eatanswill
we
have
minutely
examined
every
corner
of
the
pocket
county
maps
issued
for
the
benefit
of
society
by
our
distinguished
publishers
and
the
same
result
has
attended
our
investigation
we
are
therefore
led
to
believe
that
pickwick
with
that
anxious
desire
to
abstain
from
giving
offence
to
any
and
with
those
delicate
feelings
for
which
all
who
knew
him
well
know
he
was
so
eminently
remarkable
purposely
substituted
a
fictitious
designation
for
the
real
name
of
the
place
in
which
his
observations
were
made
we
are
confirmed
in
this
belief
by
a
little
circumstance
apparently
slight
and
trivial
in
itself
but
when
considered
in
this
point
of
view
not
undeserving
of
notice
in
pickwick
s
we
can
just
trace
an
entry
of
the
fact
that
the
places
of
himself
and
followers
were
booked
by
the
norwich
coach
but
this
entry
was
afterwards
lined
through
as
if
for
the
purpose
of
concealing
even
the
direction
in
which
the
borough
is
situated
we
will
not
therefore
hazard
a
guess
upon
the
subject
but
will
at
once
proceed
with
this
history
content
with
the
materials
which
its
characters
have
provided
for
us
it
appears
then
that
the
eatanswill
people
like
the
people
of
many
other
small
towns
considered
themselves
of
the
utmost
and
most
mighty
importance
and
that
every
man
in
eatanswill
conscious
of
the
weight
that
attached
to
his
example
felt
himself
bound
to
unite
heart
and
soul
with
one
of
the
two
great
parties
that
divided
the
town
the
blues
and
the
buffs
now
the
blues
lost
no
opportunity
of
opposing
the
buffs
and
the
buffs
lost
no
opportunity
of
opposing
the
blues
and
the
consequence
was
that
whenever
the
buffs
and
blues
met
together
at
public
meeting
fair
or
market
disputes
and
high
words
arose
between
them
with
these
dissensions
it
is
almost
superfluous
to
say
that
everything
in
eatanswill
was
made
a
party
question
if
the
buffs
proposed
to
new
skylight
the
the
blues
got
up
public
meetings
and
denounced
the
proceeding
if
the
blues
proposed
the
erection
of
an
additional
pump
in
the
high
street
the
buffs
rose
as
one
man
and
stood
aghast
at
the
enormity
there
were
blue
shops
and
buff
shops
blue
inns
and
buff
inns
there
was
a
blue
aisle
and
a
buff
aisle
in
the
very
church
itself
of
course
it
was
essentially
and
indispensably
necessary
that
each
of
these
powerful
parties
should
have
its
chosen
organ
and
representative
and
accordingly
there
were
two
newspapers
in
the
town
the
eatanswill
and
the
eatanswill
the
former
advocating
blue
principles
and
the
latter
conducted
on
grounds
decidedly
buff
fine
newspapers
they
were
such
leading
articles
and
such
spirited
attacks
our
worthless
contemporary
the
that
disgraceful
and
dastardly
journal
the
that
false
and
scurrilous
print
the
that
vile
and
slanderous
calumniator
the
these
and
other
denunciations
were
strewn
plentifully
over
the
columns
of
each
in
every
number
and
excited
feelings
of
the
most
intense
delight
and
indignation
in
the
bosoms
of
the
townspeople
pickwick
with
his
usual
foresight
and
sagacity
had
chosen
a
peculiarly
desirable
moment
for
his
visit
to
the
borough
never
was
such
a
contest
known
the
honourable
samuel
slumkey
of
slumkey
hall
was
the
blue
candidate
and
horatio
fizkin
of
fizkin
lodge
near
eatanswill
had
been
prevailed
upon
by
his
friends
to
stand
forward
on
the
buff
interest
the
warned
the
electors
of
eatanswill
that
the
eyes
not
only
of
england
but
of
the
whole
civilised
world
were
upon
them
and
the
imperatively
demanded
to
know
whether
the
constituency
of
eatanswill
were
the
grand
fellows
they
had
always
taken
them
for
or
base
and
servile
tools
undeserving
alike
of
the
name
of
englishmen
and
the
blessings
of
freedom
never
had
such
a
commotion
agitated
the
town
before
it
was
late
in
the
evening
when
pickwick
and
his
companions
assisted
by
sam
dismounted
from
the
roof
of
the
eatanswill
coach
large
blue
silk
flags
were
flying
from
the
windows
of
the
town
arms
inn
and
bills
were
posted
in
every
sash
intimating
in
gigantic
letters
that
the
honourable
samuel
slumkey
s
committee
sat
there
daily
a
crowd
of
idlers
were
assembled
in
the
road
looking
at
a
hoarse
man
in
the
balcony
who
was
apparently
talking
himself
very
red
in
the
face
in
slumkey
s
behalf
but
the
force
and
point
of
whose
arguments
were
somewhat
impaired
by
the
perpetual
beating
of
four
large
drums
which
fizkin
s
committee
had
stationed
at
the
street
corner
there
was
a
busy
little
man
beside
him
though
who
took
off
his
hat
at
intervals
and
motioned
to
the
people
to
cheer
which
they
regularly
did
most
enthusiastically
and
as
the
gentleman
went
on
talking
till
he
was
redder
in
the
face
than
ever
it
seemed
to
answer
his
purpose
quite
as
well
as
if
anybody
had
heard
him
the
pickwickians
had
no
sooner
dismounted
than
they
were
surrounded
by
a
branch
mob
of
the
honest
and
independent
who
forthwith
set
up
three
deafening
cheers
which
being
responded
to
by
the
main
body
for
it
s
not
at
all
necessary
for
a
crowd
to
know
what
they
are
cheering
about
swelled
into
a
tremendous
roar
of
triumph
which
stopped
even
the
faced
man
in
the
balcony
hurrah
shouted
the
mob
in
conclusion
one
cheer
more
screamed
the
little
fugleman
in
the
balcony
and
out
shouted
the
mob
again
as
if
lungs
were
with
steel
works
slumkey
for
ever
roared
the
honest
and
independent
slumkey
for
ever
echoed
pickwick
taking
off
his
hat
no
fizkin
roared
the
crowd
certainly
not
shouted
pickwick
hurrah
and
then
there
was
another
roaring
like
that
of
a
whole
menagerie
when
the
elephant
has
rung
the
bell
for
the
cold
meat
who
is
slumkey
whispered
tupman
i
don
t
know
replied
pickwick
in
the
same
tone
hush
don
t
ask
any
questions
it
s
always
best
on
these
occasions
to
do
what
the
mob
but
suppose
there
are
two
mobs
suggested
snodgrass
shout
with
the
largest
replied
pickwick
volumes
could
not
have
said
more
they
entered
the
house
the
crowd
opening
right
and
left
to
let
them
pass
and
cheering
vociferously
the
first
object
of
consideration
was
to
secure
quarters
for
the
night
can
we
have
beds
here
inquired
pickwick
summoning
the
waiter
don
t
know
sir
replied
the
man
afraid
we
re
full
sir
i
ll
inquire
away
he
went
for
that
purpose
and
presently
returned
to
ask
whether
the
gentleman
were
as
neither
pickwick
nor
his
companions
took
any
vital
interest
in
the
cause
of
either
candidate
the
question
was
rather
a
difficult
one
to
answer
in
this
dilemma
pickwick
bethought
himself
of
his
new
friend
perker
do
you
know
a
gentleman
of
the
name
of
perker
inquired
pickwick
certainly
sir
honourable
samuel
slumkey
s
he
is
blue
i
think
oh
yes
then
are
blue
said
pickwick
but
observing
that
the
man
looked
rather
doubtful
at
this
accommodating
announcement
he
gave
him
his
card
and
desired
him
to
present
it
to
perker
forthwith
if
he
should
happen
to
be
in
the
house
the
waiter
retired
and
reappearing
almost
immediately
with
a
request
that
pickwick
would
follow
him
led
the
way
to
a
large
room
on
the
first
floor
where
seated
at
a
long
table
covered
with
books
and
papers
was
perker
ah
ah
my
dear
sir
said
the
little
man
advancing
to
meet
him
very
happy
to
see
you
my
dear
sir
very
pray
sit
down
so
you
have
carried
your
intention
into
effect
you
have
come
down
here
to
see
an
election
eh
pickwick
replied
in
the
affirmative
spirited
contest
my
dear
sir
said
the
little
man
i
m
delighted
to
hear
it
said
pickwick
rubbing
his
hands
i
like
to
see
sturdy
patriotism
on
whatever
side
it
is
called
forth
and
so
it
s
a
spirited
contest
oh
yes
said
the
little
man
very
much
so
indeed
we
have
opened
all
the
in
the
place
and
left
our
adversary
nothing
but
the
masterly
stroke
of
policy
that
my
dear
sir
eh
the
little
man
smiled
complacently
and
took
a
large
pinch
of
snuff
and
what
are
the
probabilities
as
to
the
result
of
the
contest
inquired
pickwick
why
doubtful
my
dear
sir
rather
doubtful
as
yet
replied
the
little
man
fizkin
s
people
have
got
voters
in
the
at
the
white
in
the
said
pickwick
considerably
astonished
by
this
second
stroke
of
policy
they
keep
em
locked
up
there
till
they
want
em
resumed
the
little
man
the
effect
of
that
is
you
see
to
prevent
our
getting
at
them
and
even
if
we
could
it
would
be
of
no
use
for
they
keep
them
very
drunk
on
purpose
smart
fellow
fizkin
s
agent
very
smart
fellow
pickwick
stared
but
said
nothing
we
are
pretty
confident
though
said
perker
sinking
his
voice
almost
to
a
whisper
we
had
a
little
here
last
night
women
my
dear
sir
and
gave
every
one
of
em
a
green
parasol
when
she
went
a
parasol
said
pickwick
fact
my
dear
sir
fact
green
parasols
at
seven
and
sixpence
all
women
like
finery
extraordinary
the
effect
of
those
parasols
secured
all
their
husbands
and
half
their
brothers
beats
stockings
and
flannel
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
hollow
my
idea
my
dear
sir
entirely
hail
rain
or
sunshine
you
can
t
walk
half
a
dozen
yards
up
the
street
without
encountering
half
a
dozen
green
here
the
little
man
indulged
in
a
convulsion
of
mirth
which
was
only
checked
by
the
entrance
of
a
third
party
this
was
a
tall
thin
man
with
a
head
inclined
to
baldness
and
a
face
in
which
solemn
importance
was
blended
with
a
look
of
unfathomable
profundity
he
was
dressed
in
a
long
brown
surtout
with
a
black
cloth
waistcoat
and
drab
trousers
a
double
eyeglass
dangled
at
his
waistcoat
and
on
his
head
he
wore
a
very
hat
with
a
broad
brim
the
was
introduced
to
pickwick
as
pott
the
editor
of
the
eatanswill
after
a
few
preliminary
remarks
pott
turned
round
to
pickwick
and
said
with
solemnity
this
contest
excites
great
interest
in
the
metropolis
sir
i
believe
it
does
said
pickwick
to
which
i
have
reason
to
know
said
pott
looking
towards
perker
for
corroboration
to
which
i
have
reason
to
know
that
my
article
of
last
saturday
in
some
degree
not
the
least
doubt
of
it
said
the
little
man
the
press
is
a
mighty
engine
sir
said
pott
pickwick
yielded
his
fullest
assent
to
the
proposition
but
i
trust
sir
said
pott
that
i
have
never
abused
the
enormous
power
i
wield
i
trust
sir
that
i
have
never
pointed
the
noble
instrument
which
is
placed
in
my
hands
against
the
sacred
bosom
of
private
life
or
the
tender
breast
of
individual
reputation
i
trust
sir
that
i
have
devoted
my
energies
to
to
endeavours
humble
they
may
be
humble
i
know
they
are
to
instil
those
principles
of
which
are
here
the
editor
of
the
eatanswill
appearing
to
ramble
pickwick
came
to
his
relief
and
said
and
what
sir
said
pott
what
sir
let
me
ask
you
as
an
impartial
man
is
the
state
of
the
public
mind
in
london
with
reference
to
my
contest
with
the
greatly
excited
no
doubt
interposed
perker
with
a
look
of
slyness
which
was
very
likely
accidental
the
contest
said
pott
shall
be
prolonged
so
long
as
i
have
health
and
strength
and
that
portion
of
talent
with
which
i
am
gifted
from
that
contest
sir
although
it
may
unsettle
men
s
minds
and
excite
their
feelings
and
render
them
incapable
for
the
discharge
of
the
everyday
duties
of
ordinary
life
from
that
contest
sir
i
will
never
shrink
till
i
have
set
my
heel
upon
the
eatanswill
i
wish
the
people
of
london
and
the
people
of
this
country
to
know
sir
that
they
may
rely
upon
me
that
i
will
not
desert
them
that
i
am
resolved
to
stand
by
them
sir
to
the
your
conduct
is
most
noble
sir
said
pickwick
and
he
grasped
the
hand
of
the
magnanimous
pott
you
are
sir
i
perceive
a
man
of
sense
and
talent
said
pott
almost
breathless
with
the
vehemence
of
his
patriotic
declaration
i
am
most
happy
sir
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
such
a
and
i
said
pickwick
feel
deeply
honoured
by
this
expression
of
your
opinion
allow
me
sir
to
introduce
you
to
my
the
other
corresponding
members
of
the
club
i
am
proud
to
have
i
shall
be
delighted
said
pott
pickwick
withdrew
and
returning
with
his
friends
presented
them
in
due
form
to
the
editor
of
the
eatanswill
now
my
dear
pott
said
little
perker
the
question
is
what
are
we
to
do
with
our
friends
here
we
can
stop
in
this
house
i
suppose
said
pickwick
not
a
spare
bed
in
the
house
my
dear
sir
not
a
single
extremely
awkward
said
pickwick
very
said
his
i
have
an
idea
upon
this
subject
said
pott
which
i
think
may
be
very
successfully
adopted
they
have
two
beds
at
the
peacock
and
i
can
boldly
say
on
behalf
of
pott
that
she
will
be
delighted
to
accommodate
pickwick
and
any
one
of
his
friends
if
the
other
two
gentlemen
and
their
servant
do
not
object
to
shifting
as
they
best
can
at
the
after
repeated
pressings
on
the
part
of
pott
and
repeated
protestations
on
that
of
pickwick
that
he
could
not
think
of
incommoding
or
troubling
his
amiable
wife
it
was
decided
that
it
was
the
only
feasible
arrangement
that
could
be
made
so
it
and
after
dinner
together
at
the
town
arms
the
friends
separated
tupman
and
snodgrass
repairing
to
the
peacock
and
pickwick
and
winkle
proceeding
to
the
mansion
of
pott
it
having
been
previously
arranged
that
they
should
all
reassemble
at
the
town
arms
in
the
morning
and
accompany
the
honourable
samuel
slumkey
s
procession
to
the
place
of
nomination
pott
s
domestic
circle
was
limited
to
himself
and
his
wife
all
men
whom
mighty
genius
has
raised
to
a
proud
eminence
in
the
world
have
usually
some
little
weakness
which
appears
the
more
conspicuous
from
the
contrast
it
presents
to
their
general
character
if
pott
had
a
weakness
it
was
perhaps
that
he
was
rather
too
submissive
to
the
somewhat
contemptuous
control
and
sway
of
his
wife
we
do
not
feel
justified
in
laying
any
particular
stress
upon
the
fact
because
on
the
present
occasion
all
pott
s
most
winning
ways
were
brought
into
requisition
to
receive
the
two
gentlemen
my
dear
said
pott
mr
pickwick
pickwick
of
pott
received
pickwick
s
paternal
grasp
of
the
hand
with
enchanting
sweetness
and
winkle
who
had
not
been
announced
at
all
sidled
and
bowed
unnoticed
in
an
obscure
corner
p
my
dear
said
pott
my
life
said
pott
pray

pickwick

echoed
pott
and
the
ceremony
of
introduction
was
complete
we
owe
you
many
apologies
ma
am
said
pickwick
for
disturbing
your
domestic
arrangements
at
so
short
a
i
beg

mention

sir
replied
the
feminine
pott
with
vivacity
it
is
a
high
treat
to
me
i
assure
you
to
see
any
new
faces
living
as
i
do
from
day
to
day
and
week
to
week
in
this
dull
place
and
seeing
nobody
my
dear
exclaimed
pott
archly
nobody
but
you
retorted
pott
with
asperity
you
see
pickwick
said
the
host
in
explanation
of
his
wife
s
lament
that
we
are
in
some
measure
cut
off
from
many
enjoyments
and
pleasures
of
which
we
might
otherwise
partake
my
public
station
as
editor
of
the
eatanswill
the
position
which
that
paper
holds
in
the
country
my
constant
immersion
in
the
vortex
of
politics
p
my
dear
interposed
pott
my
life
said
the
editor
i
wish
my
dear
you
would
endeavour
to
find
some
topic
of
conversation
in
which
these
gentlemen
might
take
some
rational
but
my
love
said
pott
with
great
humility
mr
pickwick
does
take
an
interest
in
it
s
well
for
him
if
he
can
said
pott
emphatically
i
am
wearied
out
of
my
life
with
your
politics
and
quarrels
with
the
and
nonsense
i
am
quite
astonished
at
your
making
such
an
exhibition
of
your
but
my
dear
said
pott
oh
nonsense
don
t
talk
to
me
said
pott
do
you
play
ecarte
sir
i
shall
be
very
happy
to
learn
under
your
tuition
replied
winkle
well
then
draw
that
little
table
into
this
window
and
let
me
get
out
of
hearing
of
those
prosy
jane
said
pott
to
the
servant
who
brought
in
candles
go
down
into
the
office
and
bring
me
up
the
file
of
the
for
eighteen
hundred
and
i
ll
read
you
added
the
editor
turning
to
pickwick
i
ll
just
read
you
a
few
of
the
leaders
i
wrote
at
that
time
upon
the
buff
job
of
appointing
a
new
tollman
to
the
turnpike
here
i
rather
think
they
ll
amuse
i
should
like
to
hear
them
very
much
indeed
said
pickwick
up
came
the
file
and
down
sat
the
editor
with
pickwick
at
his
side
we
have
in
vain
pored
over
the
leaves
of
pickwick
s
in
the
hope
of
meeting
with
a
general
summary
of
these
beautiful
compositions
we
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
he
was
perfectly
enraptured
with
the
vigour
and
freshness
of
the
style
indeed
winkle
has
recorded
the
fact
that
his
eyes
were
closed
as
if
with
excess
of
pleasure
during
the
whole
time
of
their
perusal
the
announcement
of
supper
put
a
stop
both
to
the
game
of
ecarte
and
the
recapitulation
of
the
beauties
of
the
eatanswill
pott
was
in
the
highest
spirits
and
the
most
agreeable
humour
winkle
had
already
made
considerable
progress
in
her
good
opinion
and
she
did
not
hesitate
to
inform
him
confidentially
that
pickwick
was
a
delightful
old
these
terms
convey
a
familiarity
of
expression
in
which
few
of
those
who
were
intimately
acquainted
with
that
man
would
have
presumed
to
indulge
we
have
preserved
them
nevertheless
as
affording
at
once
a
touching
and
a
convincing
proof
of
the
estimation
in
which
he
was
held
by
every
class
of
society
and
the
case
with
which
he
made
his
way
to
their
hearts
and
feelings
it
was
a
late
hour
of
the
night
long
after
tupman
and
snodgrass
had
fallen
asleep
in
the
inmost
recesses
of
the
peacock
when
the
two
friends
retired
to
rest
slumber
soon
fell
upon
the
senses
of
winkle
but
his
feelings
had
been
excited
and
his
admiration
roused
and
for
many
hours
after
sleep
had
rendered
him
insensible
to
earthly
objects
the
face
and
figure
of
the
agreeable
pott
presented
themselves
again
and
again
to
his
wandering
imagination
the
noise
and
bustle
which
ushered
in
the
morning
were
sufficient
to
dispel
from
the
mind
of
the
most
romantic
visionary
in
existence
any
associations
but
those
which
were
immediately
connected
with
the
election
the
beating
of
drums
the
blowing
of
horns
and
trumpets
the
shouting
of
men
and
tramping
of
horses
echoed
and
through
the
streets
from
the
earliest
dawn
of
day
and
an
occasional
fight
between
the
light
skirmishers
of
either
party
at
once
enlivened
the
preparations
and
agreeably
diversified
their
character
well
sam
said
pickwick
as
his
valet
appeared
at
his
bedroom
door
just
as
he
was
concluding
his
toilet
all
alive
i
suppose

lar

sir
replied
weller
our
people

down
at
the

pickwick
do

devoted
to
their
party
sam

such
dewotion
in
my
life

pickwick
uncommon
replied
sam
i

mistaken
kindness
of
the
gentry

pickwick
wery

replied
sam
briefly
fine
fresh
hearty
fellows

said
pickwick
glancing
from
the
window
wery
fresh
replied
sam
me
and
the
two
waiters
at
the
peacock
has
been
over
the
independent
woters
as
supped
there
last
pumping
over

exclaimed
pickwick

his
attendant
every

vere
he
fell
down
we
dragged
em
out
one
by

this
mornin
and
put

and
they

exclaimed
the
astonished
pickwick
lord
bless
your

sir
said
sam
why
where
was
you
half
baptised
that
s
nothin
that
ain
nothing
said
pickwick
nothin
at
all
sir
replied
his
attendant
the
night
afore
the
last
day
o
the
last
election
here
the
opposite
party
bribed
the
barmaid
at
the
town
arms
to
hocus
the
of
fourteen
unpolled
electors
as
was
in
the
what
do
you
mean
by
hocussing
inquired
pickwick
puttin
laud
num
in
it
replied
sam
blessed
if
she
didn
t
send
em
all
to
sleep
till
twelve
hours
arter
the
election
was
over
they
took
one
man
up
to
the
booth
in
a
truck
fast
asleep
by
way
of
experiment
but
it
was
no
go
they
wouldn
t
poll
him
so
they
brought
him
back
and
put
him
to
bed
strange
practices
these
said
pickwick
half
speaking
to
himself
and
half
addressing
sam
not
half
so
strange
as
a
miraculous
circumstance
as
happened
to
my
own
father
at
an
election
time
in
this
wery
place
sir
replied
sam
what
was
that
inquired
pickwick
why
he
drove
a
coach
down
here
once
said
sam
lection
time
came
on
and
he
was
engaged
by
vun
party
to
bring
down
woters
from
london
night
afore
he
was
going
to
drive
up

then
they

out

glass
of
wine
and
gammons
him
about
his
driving
and
gets
him
into
a
reg
lar
good

and
at
last
shoves

note
into

between

says
the

here

says
he
vich
he
did
and
then
buttons
up
the
money
and
bows
himself
out
you
wouldn
t
believe
sir
continued
sam
with
a
look
of
inexpressible
impudence
at
his
master
that
on
the
wery
day
as
he
came
down
with
them
woters
his
coach
on
that
ere
wery
spot
and
ev
ry
man
on
em
was
turned
into
the
and
got
out
again
inquired
pickwick
hastily
why
replied
sam
very
slowly
i
rather
think
one
old
gen
l
m
n
was
missin
i
know
his
hat
was
found
but
i
ain
t
quite
certain
whether
his
head
was
in
it
or
not
but
what
i
look
at
is
the
and
wonderful
coincidence
that
arter
what
that
gen
l
m
n
said
my
father
s
coach
should
be
upset
in
that
wery
place
and
on
that
wery
day
it
is
no
doubt
a
very
extraordinary
circumstance
indeed
said
pickwick
but
brush
my
hat
sam
for
i
hear
winkle
calling
me
to
with
these
words
pickwick
descended
to
the
parlour
where
he
found
breakfast
laid
and
the
family
already
assembled
the
meal
was
hastily
despatched
each
of
the
gentlemen
s
hats
was
decorated
with
an
enormous
blue
favour
made
up
by
the
fair
hands
of
pott
herself
and
as
winkle
had
undertaken
to
escort
that
lady
to
a
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
hustings
pickwick
and
pott
repaired
alone
to
the
town
arms
from
the
back
window
of
which
one
of
slumkey
s
committee
was
addressing
six
small
boys
and
one
girl
whom
he
dignified
at
every
second
sentence
with
the
imposing
title
of
men
of
eatanswill
whereat
the
six
small
boys
aforesaid
cheered
prodigiously
the
exhibited
unequivocal
symptoms
of
the
glory
and
strength
of
the
eatanswill
blues
there
was
a
regular
army
of
blue
flags
some
with
one
handle
and
some
with
two
exhibiting
appropriate
devices
in
golden
characters
four
feet
high
and
stout
in
proportion
there
was
a
grand
band
of
trumpets
bassoons
and
drums
marshalled
four
abreast
and
earning
their
money
if
ever
men
did
especially
the
who
were
very
muscular
there
were
bodies
of
constables
with
blue
staves
twenty
with
blue
scarfs
and
a
mob
of
voters
with
blue
cockades
there
were
electors
on
horseback
and
electors
afoot
there
was
an
open
for
the
honourable
samuel
slumkey
and
there
were
four
for
his
friends
and
supporters
and
the
flags
were
rustling
and
the
band
was
playing
and
the
constables
were
swearing
and
the
twenty
were
squabbling
and
the
mob
were
shouting
and
the
horses
were
backing
and
the
boys
perspiring
and
everybody
and
everything
then
and
there
assembled
was
for
the
special
use
behoof
honour
and
renown
of
the
honourable
samuel
slumkey
of
slumkey
hall
one
of
the
candidates
for
the
representation
of
the
borough
of
eatanswill
in
the
commons
house
of
parliament
of
the
united
kingdom
loud
and
long
were
the
cheers
and
mighty
was
the
rustling
of
one
of
the
blue
flags
with
liberty
of
the
press
inscribed
thereon
when
the
sandy
head
of
pott
was
discerned
in
one
of
the
windows
by
the
mob
beneath
and
tremendous
was
the
enthusiasm
when
the
honourable
samuel
slumkey
himself
in
and
a
blue
neckerchief
advanced
and
seized
the
hand
of
the
said
pott
and
melodramatically
testified
by
gestures
to
the
crowd
his
ineffaceable
obligations
to
the
eatanswill
is
everything
ready
said
the
honourable
samuel
slumkey
to
perker
everything
my
dear
sir
was
the
little
man
s
reply
nothing
has
been
omitted
i
hope
said
the
honourable
samuel
slumkey
nothing
has
been
left
undone
my
dear
sir
nothing
whatever
there
are
twenty
washed
men
at
the
street
door
for
you
to
shake
hands
with
and
six
children
in
arms
that
you
re
to
pat
on
the
head
and
inquire
the
age
of
be
particular
about
the
children
my
dear
sir
it
has
always
a
great
effect
that
sort
of
i
ll
take
care
said
the
honourable
samuel
slumkey
and
perhaps
my
dear
sir
said
the
cautious
little
man
perhaps
if
you
could
i
don
t
mean
to
say
it
s
indispensable
but
if
you
could
manage
to
kiss
one
of
em
it
would
produce
a
very
great
impression
on
the
wouldn
t
it
have
as
good
an
effect
if
the
proposer
or
seconder
did
that
said
the
honourable
samuel
slumkey
why
i
am
afraid
it
wouldn
t
replied
the
agent
if
it
were
done
by
yourself
my
dear
sir
i
think
it
would
make
you
very
very
well
said
the
honourable
samuel
slumkey
with
a
resigned
air
then
it
must
be
done
that
s
arrange
the
procession
cried
the
twenty
amidst
the
cheers
of
the
assembled
throng
the
band
and
the
constables
and
the
and
the
voters
and
the
horsemen
and
the
carriages
took
their
places
each
of
the
vehicles
being
closely
packed
with
as
many
gentlemen
as
could
manage
to
stand
upright
in
it
and
that
assigned
to
perker
containing
pickwick
tupman
snodgrass
and
about
half
a
dozen
of
the
committee
besides
there
was
a
moment
of
awful
suspense
as
the
procession
waited
for
the
honourable
samuel
slumkey
to
step
into
his
carriage
suddenly
the
crowd
set
up
a
great
cheering
he
has
come
out
said
little
perker
greatly
excited
the
more
so
as
their
position
did
not
enable
them
to
see
what
was
going
forward
another
cheer
much
louder
he
has
shaken
hands
with
the
men
cried
the
little
agent
another
cheer
far
more
vehement
he
has
patted
the
babies
on
the
head
said
perker
trembling
with
anxiety
a
roar
of
applause
that
rent
the
air
he
has
kissed
one
of
em
exclaimed
the
delighted
little
man
a
second
roar
he
has
kissed
another
gasped
the
excited
manager
a
third
roar
he
s
kissing
em
all
screamed
the
enthusiastic
little
gentleman
and
hailed
by
the
deafening
shouts
of
the
multitude
the
procession
moved
on
how
or
by
what
means
it
became
mixed
up
with
the
other
procession
and
how
it
was
ever
extricated
from
the
confusion
consequent
thereupon
is
more
than
we
can
undertake
to
describe
inasmuch
as
pickwick
s
hat
was
knocked
over
his
eyes
nose
and
mouth
by
one
poke
of
a
buff
staff
very
early
in
the
proceedings
he
describes
himself
as
being
surrounded
on
every
side
when
he
could
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
scene
by
angry
and
ferocious
countenances
by
a
vast
cloud
of
dust
and
by
a
dense
crowd
of
combatants
he
represents
himself
as
being
forced
from
the
carriage
by
some
unseen
power
and
being
personally
engaged
in
a
pugilistic
encounter
but
with
whom
or
how
or
why
he
is
wholly
unable
to
state
he
then
felt
himself
forced
up
some
wooden
steps
by
the
persons
from
behind
and
on
removing
his
hat
found
himself
surrounded
by
his
friends
in
the
very
front
of
the
left
hand
side
of
the
hustings
the
right
was
reserved
for
the
buff
party
and
the
centre
for
the
mayor
and
his
officers
one
of
whom
the
fat
crier
of
eatanswill
was
ringing
an
enormous
bell
by
way
of
commanding
silence
while
horatio
fizkin
and
the
honourable
samuel
slumkey
with
their
hands
upon
their
hearts
were
bowing
with
the
utmost
affability
to
the
troubled
sea
of
heads
that
inundated
the
open
space
in
front
and
from
whence
arose
a
storm
of
groans
and
shouts
and
yells
and
hootings
that
would
have
done
honour
to
an
earthquake
there
s
winkle
said
tupman
pulling
his
friend
by
the
sleeve
where
said
pickwick
putting
on
his
spectacles
which
he
had
fortunately
kept
in
his
pocket
hitherto
there
said
tupman
on
the
top
of
that
and
there
sure
enough
in
the
leaden
gutter
of
a
tiled
roof
were
winkle
and
pott
comfortably
seated
in
a
couple
of
chairs
waving
their
handkerchiefs
in
token
of
recognition
a
compliment
which
pickwick
returned
by
kissing
his
hand
to
the
lady
the
proceedings
had
not
yet
commenced
and
as
an
inactive
crowd
is
generally
disposed
to
be
jocose
this
very
innocent
action
was
sufficient
to
awaken
their
facetiousness
oh
you
wicked
old
rascal
cried
one
voice
looking
arter
the
girls
are
you
oh
you
wenerable
sinner
cried
another
putting
on
his
spectacles
to
look
at
a
married
ooman
said
a
third
i
see
him
at
her
with
his
wicked
old
eye
shouted
a
fourth
look
arter
your
wife
pott
bellowed
a
fifth
and
then
there
was
a
roar
of
laughter
as
these
taunts
were
accompanied
with
invidious
comparisons
between
pickwick
and
an
aged
ram
and
several
witticisms
of
the
like
nature
and
as
they
moreover
rather
tended
to
convey
reflections
upon
the
honour
of
an
innocent
lady
pickwick
s
indignation
was
excessive
but
as
silence
was
proclaimed
at
the
moment
he
contented
himself
by
scorching
the
mob
with
a
look
of
pity
for
their
misguided
minds
at
which
they
laughed
more
boisterously
than
ever
silence
roared
the
mayor
s
attendants
whiffin
proclaim
silence
said
the
mayor
with
an
air
of
pomp
befitting
his
lofty
station
in
obedience
to
this
command
the
crier
performed
another
concerto
on
the
bell
whereupon
a
gentleman
in
the
crowd
called
out
muffins
which
occasioned
another
laugh
gentlemen
said
the
mayor
at
as
loud
a
pitch
as
he
could
possibly
force
his
voice
to
gentlemen
brother
electors
of
the
borough
of
eatanswill
we
are
met
here
for
the
purpose
of
choosing
a
representative
in
the
room
of
our
late
here
the
mayor
was
interrupted
by
a
voice
in
the
crowd
to
the
mayor
cried
the
voice
and
may
he
never
desert
the
nail
and
sarspan
business
as
he
got
his
money
this
allusion
to
the
professional
pursuits
of
the
orator
was
received
with
a
storm
of
delight
which
with
a
rendered
the
remainder
of
his
speech
inaudible
with
the
exception
of
the
concluding
sentence
in
which
he
thanked
the
meeting
for
the
patient
attention
with
which
they
heard
him
throughout
an
expression
of
gratitude
which
elicited
another
burst
of
mirth
of
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
s
duration
next
a
tall
thin
gentleman
in
a
very
stiff
white
neckerchief
after
being
repeatedly
desired
by
the
crowd
to
send
a
boy
home
to
ask
whether
he
hadn
t
left
his
voice
under
the
pillow
begged
to
nominate
a
fit
and
proper
person
to
represent
them
in
parliament
and
when
he
said
it
was
horatio
fizkin
esquire
of
fizkin
lodge
near
eatanswill
the
fizkinites
applauded
and
the
slumkeyites
groaned
so
long
and
so
loudly
that
both
he
and
the
seconder
might
have
sung
comic
songs
in
lieu
of
speaking
without
anybody
s
being
a
bit
the
wiser
the
friends
of
horatio
fizkin
esquire
having
had
their
innings
a
little
choleric
man
stood
forward
to
propose
another
fit
and
proper
person
to
represent
the
electors
of
eatanswill
in
parliament
and
very
swimmingly
the
gentleman
would
have
got
on
if
he
had
not
been
rather
too
choleric
to
entertain
a
sufficient
perception
of
the
fun
of
the
crowd
but
after
a
very
few
sentences
of
figurative
eloquence
the
gentleman
got
from
denouncing
those
who
interrupted
him
in
the
mob
to
exchanging
defiances
with
the
gentlemen
on
the
hustings
whereupon
arose
an
uproar
which
reduced
him
to
the
necessity
of
expressing
his
feelings
by
serious
pantomime
which
he
did
and
then
left
the
stage
to
his
seconder
who
delivered
a
written
speech
of
half
an
hour
s
length
and
wouldn
t
be
stopped
because
he
had
sent
it
all
to
the
eatanswill
and
the
eatanswill
had
already
printed
it
every
word
then
horatio
fizkin
esquire
of
fizkin
lodge
near
eatanswill
presented
himself
for
the
purpose
of
addressing
the
electors
which
he
no
sooner
did
than
the
band
employed
by
the
honourable
samuel
slumkey
commenced
performing
with
a
power
to
which
their
strength
in
the
morning
was
a
trifle
in
return
for
which
the
buff
crowd
belaboured
the
heads
and
shoulders
of
the
blue
crowd
on
which
the
blue
crowd
endeavoured
to
dispossess
themselves
of
their
very
unpleasant
neighbours
the
buff
crowd
and
a
scene
of
struggling
and
pushing
and
fighting
succeeded
to
which
we
can
no
more
do
justice
than
the
mayor
could
although
he
issued
imperative
orders
to
twelve
constables
to
seize
the
ringleaders
who
might
amount
in
number
to
two
hundred
and
fifty
or
thereabouts
at
all
these
encounters
horatio
fizkin
esquire
of
fizkin
lodge
and
his
friends
waxed
fierce
and
furious
until
at
last
horatio
fizkin
esquire
of
fizkin
lodge
begged
to
ask
his
opponent
the
honourable
samuel
slumkey
of
slumkey
hall
whether
that
band
played
by
his
consent
which
question
the
honourable
samuel
slumkey
declining
to
answer
horatio
fizkin
esquire
of
fizkin
lodge
shook
his
fist
in
the
countenance
of
the
honourable
samuel
slumkey
of
slumkey
hall
upon
which
the
honourable
samuel
slumkey
his
blood
being
up
defied
horatio
fizkin
esquire
to
mortal
combat
at
this
violation
of
all
known
rules
and
precedents
of
order
the
mayor
commanded
another
fantasia
on
the
bell
and
declared
that
he
would
bring
before
himself
both
horatio
fizkin
esquire
of
fizkin
lodge
and
the
honourable
samuel
slumkey
of
slumkey
hall
and
bind
them
over
to
keep
the
peace
upon
this
terrific
denunciation
the
supporters
of
the
two
candidates
interfered
and
after
the
friends
of
each
party
had
quarrelled
in
pairs
for
of
an
hour
horatio
fizkin
esquire
touched
his
hat
to
the
honourable
samuel
slumkey
the
honourable
samuel
slumkey
touched
his
to
horatio
fizkin
esquire
the
band
was
stopped
the
crowd
were
partially
quieted
and
horatio
fizkin
esquire
was
permitted
to
proceed
the
speeches
of
the
two
candidates
though
differing
in
every
other
respect
afforded
a
beautiful
tribute
to
the
merit
and
high
worth
of
the
electors
of
eatanswill
both
expressed
their
opinion
that
a
more
independent
a
more
enlightened
a
more
a
more
minded
a
more
disinterested
set
of
men
than
those
who
had
promised
to
vote
for
him
never
existed
on
earth
each
darkly
hinted
his
suspicions
that
the
electors
in
the
opposite
interest
had
certain
swinish
and
besotted
infirmities
which
rendered
them
unfit
for
the
exercise
of
the
important
duties
they
were
called
upon
to
discharge
fizkin
expressed
his
readiness
to
do
anything
he
was
wanted
slumkey
his
determination
to
do
nothing
that
was
asked
of
him
both
said
that
the
trade
the
manufactures
the
commerce
the
prosperity
of
eatanswill
would
ever
be
dearer
to
their
hearts
than
any
earthly
object
and
each
had
it
in
his
power
to
state
with
the
utmost
confidence
that
he
was
the
man
who
would
eventually
be
returned
there
was
a
show
of
hands
the
mayor
decided
in
favour
of
the
honourable
samuel
slumkey
of
slumkey
hall
horatio
fizkin
esquire
of
fizkin
lodge
demanded
a
poll
and
a
poll
was
fixed
accordingly
then
a
vote
of
thanks
was
moved
to
the
mayor
for
his
able
conduct
in
the
chair
and
the
mayor
devoutly
wishing
that
he
had
had
a
chair
to
display
his
able
conduct
in
for
he
had
been
standing
during
the
whole
proceedings
returned
thanks
the
processions
reformed
the
carriages
rolled
slowly
through
the
crowd
and
its
members
screeched
and
shouted
after
them
as
their
feelings
or
caprice
dictated
during
the
whole
time
of
the
polling
the
town
was
in
a
perpetual
fever
of
excitement
everything
was
conducted
on
the
most
liberal
and
delightful
scale
excisable
articles
were
remarkably
cheap
at
all
the
and
spring
vans
paraded
the
streets
for
the
accommodation
of
voters
who
were
seized
with
any
temporary
dizziness
in
the
head
an
epidemic
which
prevailed
among
the
electors
during
the
contest
to
a
most
alarming
extent
and
under
the
influence
of
which
they
might
frequently
be
seen
lying
on
the
pavements
in
a
state
of
utter
insensibility
a
small
body
of
electors
remained
unpolled
on
the
very
last
day
they
were
calculating
and
reflecting
persons
who
had
not
yet
been
convinced
by
the
arguments
of
either
party
although
they
had
frequent
conferences
with
each
one
hour
before
the
close
of
the
poll
perker
solicited
the
honour
of
a
private
interview
with
these
intelligent
these
noble
these
patriotic
men
it
was
granted
his
arguments
were
brief
but
satisfactory
they
went
in
a
body
to
the
poll
and
when
they
returned
the
honourable
samuel
slumkey
of
slumkey
hall
was
returned
also
chapter
xiv
comprising
a
brief
description
of
the
company
at
the
peacock
assembled
and
a
tale
told
by
a
bagman
it
is
pleasant
to
turn
from
contemplating
the
strife
and
turmoil
of
political
existence
to
the
peaceful
repose
of
private
life
although
in
reality
no
great
partisan
of
either
side
pickwick
was
sufficiently
fired
with
pott
s
enthusiasm
to
apply
his
whole
time
and
attention
to
the
proceedings
of
which
the
last
chapter
affords
a
description
compiled
from
his
own
memoranda
nor
while
he
was
thus
occupied
was
winkle
idle
his
whole
time
being
devoted
to
pleasant
walks
and
short
country
excursions
with
pott
who
never
failed
when
such
an
opportunity
presented
itself
to
seek
some
relief
from
the
tedious
monotony
she
so
constantly
complained
of
the
two
gentlemen
being
thus
completely
domesticated
in
the
editor
s
house
tupman
and
snodgrass
were
in
a
great
measure
cast
upon
their
own
resources
taking
but
little
interest
in
public
affairs
they
beguiled
their
time
chiefly
with
such
amusements
as
the
peacock
afforded
which
were
limited
to
a
in
the
first
floor
and
a
sequestered
in
the
back
yard
in
the
science
and
nicety
of
both
these
recreations
which
are
far
more
abstruse
than
ordinary
men
suppose
they
were
gradually
initiated
by
weller
who
possessed
a
perfect
knowledge
of
such
pastimes
thus
notwithstanding
that
they
were
in
a
great
measure
deprived
of
the
comfort
and
advantage
of
pickwick
s
society
they
were
still
enabled
to
beguile
the
time
and
to
prevent
its
hanging
heavily
on
their
hands
it
was
in
the
evening
however
that
the
peacock
presented
attractions
which
enabled
the
two
friends
to
resist
even
the
invitations
of
the
gifted
though
prosy
pott
it
was
in
the
evening
that
the
commercial
room
was
filled
with
a
social
circle
whose
characters
and
manners
it
was
the
delight
of
tupman
to
observe
whose
sayings
and
doings
it
was
the
habit
of
snodgrass
to
note
down
most
people
know
what
sort
of
places
commercial
rooms
usually
are
that
of
the
peacock
differed
in
no
material
respect
from
the
generality
of
such
apartments
that
is
to
say
it
was
a
large
room
the
furniture
of
which
had
no
doubt
been
better
when
it
was
newer
with
a
spacious
table
in
the
centre
and
a
variety
of
smaller
dittos
in
the
corners
an
extensive
assortment
of
variously
shaped
chairs
and
an
old
turkey
carpet
bearing
about
the
same
relative
proportion
to
the
size
of
the
room
as
a
lady
s
might
to
the
floor
of
a
box
the
walls
were
garnished
with
one
or
two
large
maps
and
several
rough
greatcoats
with
complicated
capes
dangled
from
a
long
row
of
pegs
in
one
corner
the
was
ornamented
with
a
wooden
inkstand
containing
one
stump
of
a
pen
and
half
a
wafer
a
book
and
directory
a
county
history
minus
the
cover
and
the
mortal
remains
of
a
trout
in
a
glass
coffin
the
atmosphere
was
redolent
of
the
fumes
of
which
had
communicated
a
rather
dingy
hue
to
the
whole
room
and
more
especially
to
the
dusty
red
curtains
which
shaded
the
windows
on
the
sideboard
a
variety
of
miscellaneous
articles
were
huddled
together
the
most
conspicuous
of
which
were
some
very
cloudy
cruets
a
couple
of
two
or
three
whips
and
as
many
travelling
shawls
a
tray
of
knives
and
forks
and
the
mustard
here
it
was
that
tupman
and
snodgrass
were
seated
on
the
evening
after
the
conclusion
of
the
election
with
several
other
temporary
inmates
of
the
house
smoking
and
drinking
well
gents
said
a
stout
hale
personage
of
about
forty
with
only
one
eye
a
very
bright
black
eye
which
twinkled
with
a
roguish
expression
of
fun
and
our
noble
selves
gents
i
always
propose
that
toast
to
the
company
and
drink
mary
to
myself
eh
mary
get
along
with
you
you
wretch
said
the
obviously
not
with
the
compliment
however
don
t
go
away
mary
said
the
man
let
me
alone
imperence
said
the
young
lady
never
mind
said
the
man
calling
after
the
girl
as
she
left
the
room
i
ll
step
out
by
and
by
mary
keep
your
spirits
up
here
he
went
through
the
not
very
difficult
process
of
winking
upon
the
company
with
his
solitary
eye
to
the
enthusiastic
delight
of
an
elderly
personage
with
a
dirty
face
and
a
clay
pipe
rum
creeters
is
women
said
the
man
after
a
pause
ah
no
mistake
about
that
said
a
very
man
behind
a
cigar
after
this
little
bit
of
philosophy
there
was
another
pause
there
s
rummer
things
than
women
in
this
world
though
mind
you
said
the
man
with
the
black
eye
slowly
filling
a
large
dutch
pipe
with
a
most
capacious
bowl
are
you
married
inquired
the
man
can
t
say
i
i
thought
here
the
man
fell
into
ecstasies
of
mirth
at
his
own
retort
in
which
he
was
joined
by
a
man
of
bland
voice
and
placid
countenance
who
always
made
it
a
point
to
agree
with
everybody
women
after
all
gentlemen
said
the
enthusiastic
snodgrass
are
the
great
props
and
comforts
of
our
so
they
are
said
the
placid
gentleman
when
they
re
in
a
good
humour
interposed
the
man
and
that
s
very
true
said
the
placid
one
i
repudiate
that
qualification
said
snodgrass
whose
thoughts
were
fast
reverting
to
emily
wardle
i
repudiate
it
with
disdain
with
indignation
show
me
the
man
who
says
anything
against
women
as
women
and
i
boldly
declare
he
is
not
a
and
snodgrass
took
his
cigar
from
his
mouth
and
struck
the
table
violently
with
his
clenched
fist
that
s
good
sound
argument
said
the
placid
man
containing
a
position
which
i
deny
interrupted
he
of
the
dirty
countenance
and
there
s
certainly
a
very
great
deal
of
truth
in
what
you
observe
too
sir
said
the
placid
gentleman
your
health
sir
said
the
bagman
with
the
lonely
eye
bestowing
an
approving
nod
on
snodgrass
snodgrass
acknowledged
the
compliment
i
always
like
to
hear
a
good
argument
continued
the
bagman
a
sharp
one
like
this
it
s
very
improving
but
this
little
argument
about
women
brought
to
my
mind
a
story
i
have
heard
an
old
uncle
of
mine
tell
the
recollection
of
which
just
now
made
me
say
there
were
rummer
things
than
women
to
be
met
with
i
should
like
to
hear
that
same
story
said
the
man
with
the
cigar
should
you
was
the
only
reply
of
the
bagman
who
continued
to
smoke
with
great
vehemence
so
should
i
said
tupman
speaking
for
the
first
time
he
was
always
anxious
to
increase
his
stock
of
experience
should
well
then
i
ll
tell
it
no
i
won
t
i
know
you
won
t
believe
it
said
the
man
with
the
roguish
eye
making
that
organ
look
more
roguish
than
ever
if
you
say
it
s
true
of
course
i
shall
said
tupman
well
upon
that
understanding
i
ll
tell
you
replied
the
traveller
did
you
ever
hear
of
the
great
commercial
house
of
bilson
slum
but
it
doesn
t
matter
though
whether
you
did
or
not
because
they
retired
from
business
long
since
it
s
eighty
years
ago
since
the
circumstance
happened
to
a
traveller
for
that
house
but
he
was
a
particular
friend
of
my
uncle
s
and
my
uncle
told
the
story
to
me
it
s
a
queer
name
but
he
used
to
call
it
the
bagman
s
story
and
he
used
to
tell
it
something
in
this
way
one
winter
s
evening
about
five
o
clock
just
as
it
began
to
grow
dusk
a
man
in
a
gig
might
have
been
seen
urging
his
tired
horse
along
the
road
which
leads
across
marlborough
downs
in
the
direction
of
bristol
i
say
he
might
have
been
seen
and
i
have
no
doubt
he
would
have
been
if
anybody
but
a
blind
man
had
happened
to
pass
that
way
but
the
weather
was
so
bad
and
the
night
so
cold
and
wet
that
nothing
was
out
but
the
water
and
so
the
traveller
jogged
along
in
the
middle
of
the
road
lonesome
and
dreary
enough
if
any
bagman
of
that
day
could
have
caught
sight
of
the
little
sort
of
gig
with
a
body
and
red
wheels
and
the
vixenish
ill
tempered
going
bay
mare
that
looked
like
a
cross
between
a
butcher
s
horse
and
a
twopenny
pony
he
would
have
known
at
once
that
this
traveller
could
have
been
no
other
than
tom
smart
of
the
great
house
of
bilson
and
slum
cateaton
street
city
however
as
there
was
no
bagman
to
look
on
nobody
knew
anything
at
all
about
the
matter
and
so
tom
smart
and
his
gig
with
the
red
wheels
and
the
vixenish
mare
with
the
fast
pace
went
on
together
keeping
the
secret
among
them
and
nobody
was
a
bit
the
wiser
there
are
many
pleasanter
places
even
in
this
dreary
world
than
marlborough
downs
when
it
blows
hard
and
if
you
throw
in
beside
a
gloomy
winter
s
evening
a
miry
and
sloppy
road
and
a
pelting
fall
of
heavy
rain
and
try
the
effect
by
way
of
experiment
in
your
own
proper
person
you
will
experience
the
full
force
of
this
observation
the
wind
blew
not
up
the
road
or
down
it
though
that
s
bad
enough
but
sheer
across
it
sending
the
rain
slanting
down
like
the
lines
they
used
to
rule
in
the
at
school
to
make
the
boys
slope
well
for
a
moment
it
would
die
away
and
the
traveller
would
begin
to
delude
himself
into
the
belief
that
exhausted
with
its
previous
fury
it
had
quietly
laid
itself
down
to
rest
when
whoo
he
could
hear
it
growling
and
whistling
in
the
distance
and
on
it
would
come
rushing
over
the
and
sweeping
along
the
plain
gathering
sound
and
strength
as
it
drew
nearer
until
it
dashed
with
a
heavy
gust
against
horse
and
man
driving
the
sharp
rain
into
their
ears
and
its
cold
damp
breath
into
their
very
bones
and
past
them
it
would
scour
far
far
away
with
a
stunning
roar
as
if
in
ridicule
of
their
weakness
and
triumphant
in
the
consciousness
of
its
own
strength
and
power
the
bay
mare
splashed
away
through
the
mud
and
water
with
drooping
ears
now
and
then
tossing
her
head
as
if
to
express
her
disgust
at
this
very
ungentlemanly
behaviour
of
the
elements
but
keeping
a
good
pace
notwithstanding
until
a
gust
of
wind
more
furious
than
any
that
had
yet
assailed
them
caused
her
to
stop
suddenly
and
plant
her
four
feet
firmly
against
the
ground
to
prevent
her
being
blown
over
it
s
a
special
mercy
that
she
did
this
for
if
she
blown
over
the
vixenish
mare
was
so
light
and
the
gig
was
so
light
and
tom
smart
such
a
light
weight
into
the
bargain
that
they
must
infallibly
have
all
gone
rolling
over
and
over
together
until
they
reached
the
confines
of
earth
or
until
the
wind
fell
and
in
either
case
the
probability
is
that
neither
the
vixenish
mare
nor
the
gig
with
the
red
wheels
nor
tom
smart
would
ever
have
been
fit
for
service
again
well
damn
my
straps
and
whiskers
says
tom
smart
tom
sometimes
had
an
unpleasant
knack
of
swearing
damn
my
straps
and
whiskers
says
tom
if
this
ain
t
pleasant
blow
me
you
ll
very
likely
ask
me
why
as
tom
smart
had
been
pretty
well
blown
already
he
expressed
this
wish
to
be
submitted
to
the
same
process
again
i
can
t
say
all
i
know
is
that
tom
smart
said
so
or
at
least
he
always
told
my
uncle
he
said
so
and
it
s
just
the
same
thing
blow
me
says
tom
smart
and
the
mare
neighed
as
if
she
were
precisely
of
the
same
opinion
cheer
up
old
girl
said
tom
patting
the
bay
mare
on
the
neck
with
the
end
of
his
whip
it
won
t
do
pushing
on
such
a
night
as
this
the
first
house
we
come
to
we
ll
put
up
at
so
the
faster
you
go
the
sooner
it
s
over
soho
old
girl
gently
whether
the
vixenish
mare
was
sufficiently
well
acquainted
with
the
tones
of
tom
s
voice
to
comprehend
his
meaning
or
whether
she
found
it
colder
standing
still
than
moving
on
of
course
i
can
t
say
but
i
can
say
that
tom
had
no
sooner
finished
speaking
than
she
pricked
up
her
ears
and
started
forward
at
a
speed
which
made
the
gig
rattle
until
you
would
have
supposed
every
one
of
the
red
spokes
were
going
to
fly
out
on
the
turf
of
marlborough
downs
and
even
tom
whip
as
he
was
couldn
t
stop
or
check
her
pace
until
she
drew
up
of
her
own
accord
before
a
roadside
inn
on
the
side
of
the
way
about
half
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
end
of
the
downs
tom
cast
a
hasty
glance
at
the
upper
part
of
the
house
as
he
threw
the
reins
to
the
hostler
and
stuck
the
whip
in
the
box
it
was
a
strange
old
place
built
of
a
kind
of
shingle
inlaid
as
it
were
with
beams
with
windows
projecting
completely
over
the
pathway
and
a
low
door
with
a
dark
porch
and
a
couple
of
steep
steps
leading
down
into
the
house
instead
of
the
modern
fashion
of
half
a
dozen
shallow
ones
leading
up
to
it
it
was
a
place
though
for
there
was
a
strong
cheerful
light
in
the
bar
window
which
shed
a
bright
ray
across
the
road
and
even
lighted
up
the
hedge
on
the
other
side
and
there
was
a
red
flickering
light
in
the
opposite
window
one
moment
but
faintly
discernible
and
the
next
gleaming
strongly
through
the
drawn
curtains
which
intimated
that
a
rousing
fire
was
blazing
within
marking
these
little
evidences
with
the
eye
of
an
experienced
traveller
tom
dismounted
with
as
much
agility
as
his
frozen
limbs
would
permit
and
entered
the
house
in
less
than
five
minutes
time
tom
was
ensconced
in
the
room
opposite
the
bar
the
very
room
where
he
had
imagined
the
fire
blazing
before
a
substantial
roaring
fire
composed
of
something
short
of
a
bushel
of
coals
and
wood
enough
to
make
half
a
dozen
decent
gooseberry
bushes
piled
up
the
chimney
and
roaring
and
crackling
with
a
sound
that
of
itself
would
have
warmed
the
heart
of
any
reasonable
man
this
was
comfortable
but
this
was
not
all
for
a
girl
with
a
bright
eye
and
a
neat
ankle
was
laying
a
very
clean
white
cloth
on
the
table
and
as
tom
sat
with
his
slippered
feet
on
the
fender
and
his
back
to
the
open
door
he
saw
a
charming
prospect
of
the
bar
reflected
in
the
glass
over
the
with
delightful
rows
of
green
bottles
and
gold
labels
together
with
jars
of
pickles
and
preserves
and
cheeses
and
boiled
hams
and
rounds
of
beef
arranged
on
shelves
in
the
most
tempting
and
delicious
array
well
this
was
comfortable
too
but
even
this
was
not
all
for
in
the
bar
seated
at
tea
at
the
nicest
possible
little
table
drawn
close
up
before
the
brightest
possible
little
fire
was
a
buxom
widow
of
somewhere
about
or
thereabouts
with
a
face
as
comfortable
as
the
bar
who
was
evidently
the
landlady
of
the
house
and
the
supreme
ruler
over
all
these
agreeable
possessions
there
was
only
one
drawback
to
the
beauty
of
the
whole
picture
and
that
was
a
tall
man
a
very
tall
man
in
a
brown
coat
and
bright
basket
buttons
and
black
whiskers
and
wavy
black
hair
who
was
seated
at
tea
with
the
widow
and
who
it
required
no
great
penetration
to
discover
was
in
a
fair
way
of
persuading
her
to
be
a
widow
no
longer
but
to
confer
upon
him
the
privilege
of
sitting
down
in
that
bar
for
and
during
the
whole
remainder
of
the
term
of
his
natural
life
tom
smart
was
by
no
means
of
an
irritable
or
envious
disposition
but
somehow
or
other
the
tall
man
with
the
brown
coat
and
the
bright
basket
buttons
did
rouse
what
little
gall
he
had
in
his
composition
and
did
make
him
feel
extremely
indignant
the
more
especially
as
he
could
now
and
then
observe
from
his
seat
before
the
glass
certain
little
affectionate
familiarities
passing
between
the
tall
man
and
the
widow
which
sufficiently
denoted
that
the
tall
man
was
as
high
in
favour
as
he
was
in
size
tom
was
fond
of
hot
punch
i
may
venture
to
say
he
was
fond
of
hot
punch
and
after
he
had
seen
the
vixenish
mare
well
fed
and
well
littered
down
and
had
eaten
every
bit
of
the
nice
little
hot
dinner
which
the
widow
tossed
up
for
him
with
her
own
hands
he
just
ordered
a
tumbler
of
it
by
way
of
experiment
now
if
there
was
one
thing
in
the
whole
range
of
domestic
art
which
the
widow
could
manufacture
better
than
another
it
was
this
identical
article
and
the
first
tumbler
was
adapted
to
tom
smart
s
taste
with
such
peculiar
nicety
that
he
ordered
a
second
with
the
least
possible
delay
hot
punch
is
a
pleasant
thing
gentlemen
an
extremely
pleasant
thing
under
any
circumstances
but
in
that
snug
old
parlour
before
the
roaring
fire
with
the
wind
blowing
outside
till
every
timber
in
the
old
house
creaked
again
tom
smart
found
it
perfectly
delightful
he
ordered
another
tumbler
and
then
another
i
am
not
quite
certain
whether
he
didn
t
order
another
after
that
but
the
more
he
drank
of
the
hot
punch
the
more
he
thought
of
the
tall
man
confound
his
impudence
said
tom
to
himself
what
business
has
he
in
that
snug
bar
such
an
ugly
villain
too
said
tom
if
the
widow
had
any
taste
she
might
surely
pick
up
some
better
fellow
than
here
tom
s
eye
wandered
from
the
glass
on
the
to
the
glass
on
the
table
and
as
he
felt
himself
becoming
gradually
sentimental
he
emptied
the
fourth
tumbler
of
punch
and
ordered
a
fifth
tom
smart
gentlemen
had
always
been
very
much
attached
to
the
public
line
it
had
been
long
his
ambition
to
stand
in
a
bar
of
his
own
in
a
green
coat
and
tops
he
had
a
great
notion
of
taking
the
chair
at
convivial
dinners
and
he
had
often
thought
how
well
he
could
preside
in
a
room
of
his
own
in
the
talking
way
and
what
a
capital
example
he
could
set
to
his
customers
in
the
drinking
department
all
these
things
passed
rapidly
through
tom
s
mind
as
he
sat
drinking
the
hot
punch
by
the
roaring
fire
and
he
felt
very
justly
and
properly
indignant
that
the
tall
man
should
be
in
a
fair
way
of
keeping
such
an
excellent
house
while
he
tom
smart
was
as
far
off
from
it
as
ever
so
after
deliberating
over
the
two
last
tumblers
whether
he
hadn
t
a
perfect
right
to
pick
a
quarrel
with
the
tall
man
for
having
contrived
to
get
into
the
good
graces
of
the
buxom
widow
tom
smart
at
last
arrived
at
the
satisfactory
conclusion
that
he
was
a
very
and
persecuted
individual
and
had
better
go
to
bed
up
a
wide
and
ancient
staircase
the
smart
girl
preceded
tom
shading
the
chamber
candle
with
her
hand
to
protect
it
from
the
currents
of
air
which
in
such
a
rambling
old
place
might
have
found
plenty
of
room
to
disport
themselves
in
without
blowing
the
candle
out
but
which
did
blow
it
out
nevertheless
thus
affording
tom
s
enemies
an
opportunity
of
asserting
that
it
was
he
and
not
the
wind
who
extinguished
the
candle
and
that
while
he
pretended
to
be
blowing
it
alight
again
he
was
in
fact
kissing
the
girl
be
this
as
it
may
another
light
was
obtained
and
tom
was
conducted
through
a
maze
of
rooms
and
a
labyrinth
of
passages
to
the
apartment
which
had
been
prepared
for
his
reception
where
the
girl
bade
him
and
left
him
alone
it
was
a
good
large
room
with
big
closets
and
a
bed
which
might
have
served
for
a
whole
to
say
nothing
of
a
couple
of
oaken
presses
that
would
have
held
the
baggage
of
a
small
army
but
what
struck
tom
s
fancy
most
was
a
strange
high
backed
chair
carved
in
the
most
fantastic
manner
with
a
flowered
damask
cushion
and
the
round
knobs
at
the
bottom
of
the
legs
carefully
tied
up
in
red
cloth
as
if
it
had
got
the
gout
in
its
toes
of
any
other
queer
chair
tom
would
only
have
thought
it
was
a
queer
chair
and
there
would
have
been
an
end
of
the
matter
but
there
was
something
about
this
particular
chair
and
yet
he
couldn
t
tell
what
it
was
so
odd
and
so
unlike
any
other
piece
of
furniture
he
had
ever
seen
that
it
seemed
to
fascinate
him
he
sat
down
before
the
fire
and
stared
at
the
old
chair
for
half
an
damn
the
chair
it
was
such
a
strange
old
thing
he
couldn
t
take
his
eyes
off
it
well
said
tom
slowly
undressing
himself
and
staring
at
the
old
chair
all
the
while
which
stood
with
a
mysterious
aspect
by
the
bedside
i
never
saw
such
a
rum
concern
as
that
in
my
days
very
odd
said
tom
who
had
got
rather
sage
with
the
hot
punch
very
tom
shook
his
head
with
an
air
of
profound
wisdom
and
looked
at
the
chair
again
he
couldn
t
make
anything
of
it
though
so
he
got
into
bed
covered
himself
up
warm
and
fell
asleep
in
about
half
an
hour
tom
woke
up
with
a
start
from
a
confused
dream
of
tall
men
and
tumblers
of
punch
and
the
first
object
that
presented
itself
to
his
waking
imagination
was
the
queer
chair
i
won
t
look
at
it
any
more
said
tom
to
himself
and
he
squeezed
his
eyelids
together
and
tried
to
persuade
himself
he
was
going
to
sleep
again
no
use
nothing
but
queer
chairs
danced
before
his
eyes
kicking
up
their
legs
jumping
over
each
other
s
backs
and
playing
all
kinds
of
antics
i
may
as
well
see
one
real
chair
as
two
or
three
complete
sets
of
false
ones
said
tom
bringing
out
his
head
from
under
the
bedclothes
there
it
was
plainly
discernible
by
the
light
of
the
fire
looking
as
provoking
as
ever
tom
gazed
at
the
chair
and
suddenly
as
he
looked
at
it
a
most
extraordinary
change
seemed
to
come
over
it
the
carving
of
the
back
gradually
assumed
the
lineaments
and
expression
of
an
old
shrivelled
human
face
the
damask
cushion
became
an
antique
flapped
waistcoat
the
round
knobs
grew
into
a
couple
of
feet
encased
in
red
cloth
slippers
and
the
whole
chair
looked
like
a
very
ugly
old
man
of
the
previous
century
with
his
arms
akimbo
tom
sat
up
in
bed
and
rubbed
his
eyes
to
dispel
the
illusion
no
the
chair
was
an
ugly
old
gentleman
and
what
was
more
he
was
winking
at
tom
smart
tom
was
naturally
a
headlong
careless
sort
of
dog
and
he
had
had
five
tumblers
of
hot
punch
into
the
bargain
so
although
he
was
a
little
startled
at
first
he
began
to
grow
rather
indignant
when
he
saw
the
old
gentleman
winking
and
leering
at
him
with
such
an
impudent
air
at
length
he
resolved
that
he
wouldn
t
stand
it
and
as
the
old
face
still
kept
winking
away
as
fast
as
ever
tom
said
in
a
very
angry
tone
what
the
devil
are
you
winking
at
me
for
because
i
like
it
tom
smart
said
the
chair
or
the
old
gentleman
whichever
you
like
to
call
him
he
stopped
winking
though
when
tom
spoke
and
began
grinning
like
a
superannuated
monkey
how
do
you
know
my
name
old
face
inquired
tom
smart
rather
staggered
though
he
pretended
to
carry
it
off
so
well
come
come
tom
said
the
old
gentleman
that
s
not
the
way
to
address
solid
spanish
mahogany
damme
you
couldn
t
treat
me
with
less
respect
if
i
was
when
the
old
gentleman
said
this
he
looked
so
fierce
that
tom
began
to
grow
frightened
i
didn
t
mean
to
treat
you
with
any
disrespect
sir
said
tom
in
a
much
humbler
tone
than
he
had
spoken
in
at
first
well
well
said
the
old
fellow
perhaps
not
perhaps
not
tom
sir
i
know
everything
about
you
tom
everything
you
re
very
poor
i
certainly
am
said
tom
smart
but
how
came
you
to
know
that
never
mind
that
said
the
old
gentleman
you
re
much
too
fond
of
punch
tom
smart
was
just
on
the
point
of
protesting
that
he
hadn
t
tasted
a
drop
since
his
last
birthday
but
when
his
eye
encountered
that
of
the
old
gentleman
he
looked
so
knowing
that
tom
blushed
and
was
silent
tom
said
the
old
gentleman
the
widow
s
a
fine
woman
remarkably
fine
woman
eh
tom
here
the
old
fellow
screwed
up
his
eyes
cocked
up
one
of
his
wasted
little
legs
and
looked
altogether
so
unpleasantly
amorous
that
tom
was
quite
disgusted
with
the
levity
of
his
behaviour
at
his
time
of
life
too
i
am
her
guardian
tom
said
the
old
gentleman
are
you
inquired
tom
smart
i
knew
her
mother
tom
said
the
old
fellow
and
her
grandmother
she
was
very
fond
of
me
made
me
this
waistcoat
did
she
said
tom
smart
and
these
shoes
said
the
old
fellow
lifting
up
one
of
the
red
cloth
mufflers
but
don
t
mention
it
tom
i
shouldn
t
like
to
have
it
known
that
she
was
so
much
attached
to
me
it
might
occasion
some
unpleasantness
in
the
when
the
old
rascal
said
this
he
looked
so
extremely
impertinent
that
as
tom
smart
afterwards
declared
he
could
have
sat
upon
him
without
remorse
i
have
been
a
great
favourite
among
the
women
in
my
time
tom
said
the
profligate
old
debauchee
hundreds
of
fine
women
have
sat
in
my
lap
for
hours
together
what
do
you
think
of
that
you
dog
eh
the
old
gentleman
was
proceeding
to
recount
some
other
exploits
of
his
youth
when
he
was
seized
with
such
a
violent
fit
of
creaking
that
he
was
unable
to
proceed
just
serves
you
right
old
boy
thought
tom
smart
but
he
didn
t
say
anything
ah
said
the
old
fellow
i
am
a
good
deal
troubled
with
this
now
i
am
getting
old
tom
and
have
lost
nearly
all
my
nails
i
have
had
an
operation
performed
too
a
small
piece
let
into
my
back
and
i
found
it
a
severe
trial
i
dare
say
you
did
sir
said
tom
smart
however
said
the
old
gentleman
that
s
not
the
point
tom
i
want
you
to
marry
the
me
sir
said
tom
you
said
the
old
gentleman
bless
your
reverend
locks
said
tom
he
had
a
few
scattered
hairs
left
bless
your
reverend
locks
she
wouldn
t
have
and
tom
sighed
involuntarily
as
he
thought
of
the
bar
wouldn
t
she
said
the
old
gentleman
firmly
no
no
said
tom
there
s
somebody
else
in
the
wind
a
tall
man
a
confoundedly
tall
man
with
black
tom
said
the
old
gentleman
she
will
never
have
won
t
she
said
tom
if
you
stood
in
the
bar
old
gentleman
you
d
tell
another
pooh
pooh
said
the
old
gentleman
i
know
all
about
about
what
said
tom
the
kissing
behind
the
door
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
tom
said
the
old
gentleman
and
here
he
gave
another
impudent
look
which
made
tom
very
wroth
because
as
you
all
know
gentlemen
to
hear
an
old
fellow
who
ought
to
know
better
talking
about
these
things
is
very
unpleasant
nothing
more
so
i
know
all
about
that
tom
said
the
old
gentleman
i
have
seen
it
done
very
often
in
my
time
tom
between
more
people
than
i
should
like
to
mention
to
you
but
it
never
came
to
anything
after
you
must
have
seen
some
queer
things
said
tom
with
an
inquisitive
look
you
may
say
that
tom
replied
the
old
fellow
with
a
very
complicated
wink
i
am
the
last
of
my
family
tom
said
the
old
gentleman
with
a
melancholy
sigh
was
it
a
large
one
inquired
tom
smart
there
were
twelve
of
us
tom
said
the
old
gentleman
fine
handsome
fellows
as
you
d
wish
to
see
none
of
your
modern
abortions
all
with
arms
and
with
a
degree
of
polish
though
i
say
it
that
should
not
which
it
would
have
done
your
heart
good
to
and
what
s
become
of
the
others
sir
asked
tom
smart
the
old
gentleman
applied
his
elbow
to
his
eye
as
he
replied
gone
tom
gone
we
had
hard
service
tom
and
they
hadn
t
all
my
constitution
they
got
rheumatic
about
the
legs
and
arms
and
went
into
kitchens
and
other
hospitals
and
one
of
em
with
long
service
and
hard
usage
positively
lost
his
senses
he
got
so
crazy
that
he
was
obliged
to
be
burnt
shocking
thing
that
dreadful
said
tom
smart
the
old
fellow
paused
for
a
few
minutes
apparently
struggling
with
his
feelings
of
emotion
and
then
said
however
tom
i
am
wandering
from
the
point
this
tall
man
tom
is
a
rascally
adventurer
the
moment
he
married
the
widow
he
would
sell
off
all
the
furniture
and
run
away
what
would
be
the
consequence
she
would
be
deserted
and
reduced
to
ruin
and
i
should
catch
my
death
of
cold
in
some
broker
s
yes
but
don
t
interrupt
me
said
the
old
gentleman
of
you
tom
i
entertain
a
very
different
opinion
for
i
well
know
that
if
you
once
settled
yourself
in
a
you
would
never
leave
it
as
long
as
there
was
anything
to
drink
within
its
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
your
good
opinion
sir
said
tom
smart
therefore
resumed
the
old
gentleman
in
a
dictatorial
tone
you
shall
have
her
and
he
shall
what
is
to
prevent
it
said
tom
smart
eagerly
this
disclosure
replied
the
old
gentleman
he
is
already
how
can
i
prove
it
said
tom
starting
half
out
of
bed
the
old
gentleman
untucked
his
arm
from
his
side
and
having
pointed
to
one
of
the
oaken
presses
immediately
replaced
it
in
its
old
position
he
little
thinks
said
the
old
gentleman
that
in
the
pocket
of
a
pair
of
trousers
in
that
press
he
has
left
a
letter
entreating
him
to
return
to
his
disconsolate
wife
with
six
mark
me
tom
six
babes
and
all
of
them
small
as
the
old
gentleman
solemnly
uttered
these
words
his
features
grew
less
and
less
distinct
and
his
figure
more
shadowy
a
film
came
over
tom
smart
s
eyes
the
old
man
seemed
gradually
blending
into
the
chair
the
damask
waistcoat
to
resolve
into
a
cushion
the
red
slippers
to
shrink
into
little
red
cloth
bags
the
light
faded
gently
away
and
tom
smart
fell
back
on
his
pillow
and
dropped
asleep
morning
aroused
tom
from
the
lethargic
slumber
into
which
he
had
fallen
on
the
disappearance
of
the
old
man
he
sat
up
in
bed
and
for
some
minutes
vainly
endeavoured
to
recall
the
events
of
the
preceding
night
suddenly
they
rushed
upon
him
he
looked
at
the
chair
it
was
a
fantastic
and
piece
of
furniture
certainly
but
it
must
have
been
a
remarkably
ingenious
and
lively
imagination
that
could
have
discovered
any
resemblance
between
it
and
an
old
man
how
are
you
old
boy
said
tom
he
was
bolder
in
the
daylight
most
men
are
the
chair
remained
motionless
and
spoke
not
a
word
miserable
morning
said
tom
no
the
chair
would
not
be
drawn
into
conversation
which
press
did
you
point
to
you
can
tell
me
that
said
tom
devil
a
word
gentlemen
the
chair
would
say
it
s
not
much
trouble
to
open
it
anyhow
said
tom
getting
out
of
bed
very
deliberately
he
walked
up
to
one
of
the
presses
the
key
was
in
the
lock
he
turned
it
and
opened
the
door
there
was
a
pair
of
trousers
there
he
put
his
hand
into
the
pocket
and
drew
forth
the
identical
letter
the
old
gentleman
had
described
queer
sort
of
thing
this
said
tom
smart
looking
first
at
the
chair
and
then
at
the
press
and
then
at
the
letter
and
then
at
the
chair
again
very
queer
said
tom
but
as
there
was
nothing
in
either
to
lessen
the
queerness
he
thought
he
might
as
well
dress
himself
and
settle
the
tall
man
s
business
at
once
just
to
put
him
out
of
his
misery
tom
surveyed
the
rooms
he
passed
through
on
his
way
downstairs
with
the
scrutinising
eye
of
a
landlord
thinking
it
not
impossible
that
before
long
they
and
their
contents
would
be
his
property
the
tall
man
was
standing
in
the
snug
little
bar
with
his
hands
behind
him
quite
at
home
he
grinned
vacantly
at
tom
a
casual
observer
might
have
supposed
he
did
it
only
to
show
his
white
teeth
but
tom
smart
thought
that
a
consciousness
of
triumph
was
passing
through
the
place
where
the
tall
man
s
mind
would
have
been
if
he
had
had
any
tom
laughed
in
his
face
and
summoned
the
landlady
ma
am
said
tom
smart
closing
the
door
of
the
little
parlour
as
the
widow
entered
sir
said
the
widow
what
will
you
take
for
breakfast
sir
tom
was
thinking
how
he
should
open
the
case
so
he
made
no
answer
there
s
a
very
nice
ham
said
the
widow
and
a
beautiful
cold
larded
fowl
shall
i
send
em
in
sir
these
words
roused
tom
from
his
reflections
his
admiration
of
the
widow
increased
as
she
spoke
thoughtful
creature
comfortable
provider
who
is
that
gentleman
in
the
bar
ma
am
inquired
tom
his
name
is
jinkins
sir
said
the
widow
slightly
blushing
he
s
a
tall
man
said
tom
he
is
a
very
fine
man
sir
replied
the
widow
and
a
very
nice
ah
said
tom
is
there
anything
more
you
want
sir
inquired
the
widow
rather
puzzled
by
tom
s
manner
why
yes
said
tom
my
dear
ma
am
will
you
have
the
kindness
to
sit
down
for
one
moment
the
widow
looked
much
amazed
but
she
sat
down
and
tom
sat
down
too
close
beside
her
i
don
t
know
how
it
happened
gentlemen
indeed
my
uncle
used
to
tell
me
that
tom
smart
said
he
didn
t
know
how
it
happened
either
but
somehow
or
other
the
palm
of
tom
s
hand
fell
upon
the
back
of
the
widow
s
hand
and
remained
there
while
he
spoke
my
dear
ma
am
said
tom
smart
he
had
always
a
great
notion
of
committing
the
amiable
my
dear
ma
am
you
deserve
a
very
excellent
husband
you
do
lor
sir
said
the
widow
as
well
she
might
tom
s
mode
of
commencing
the
conversation
being
rather
unusual
not
to
say
startling
the
fact
of
his
never
having
set
eyes
upon
her
before
the
previous
night
being
taken
into
consideration
lor
sir
i
scorn
to
flatter
my
dear
ma
am
said
tom
smart
you
deserve
a
very
admirable
husband
and
whoever
he
is
he
ll
be
a
very
lucky
as
tom
said
this
his
eye
involuntarily
wandered
from
the
widow
s
face
to
the
comfort
around
him
the
widow
looked
more
puzzled
than
ever
and
made
an
effort
to
rise
tom
gently
pressed
her
hand
as
if
to
detain
her
and
she
kept
her
seat
widows
gentlemen
are
not
usually
timorous
as
my
uncle
used
to
say
i
am
sure
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
sir
for
your
good
opinion
said
the
buxom
landlady
half
laughing
and
if
ever
i
marry
again
said
tom
smart
looking
very
shrewdly
out
of
the
corner
of
his
left
eye
well
said
the
widow
laughing
outright
this
time
do
i
hope
i
shall
have
as
good
a
husband
as
you
jinkins
to
wit
said
tom
lor
sir
exclaimed
the
widow
oh
don
t
tell
me
said
tom
i
know
i
am
sure
nobody
who
knows
him
knows
anything
bad
of
him
said
the
widow
bridling
up
at
the
mysterious
air
with
which
tom
had
spoken
hem
said
tom
smart
the
widow
began
to
think
it
was
high
time
to
cry
so
she
took
out
her
handkerchief
and
inquired
whether
tom
wished
to
insult
her
whether
he
thought
it
like
a
gentleman
to
take
away
the
character
of
another
gentleman
behind
his
back
why
if
he
had
got
anything
to
say
he
didn
t
say
it
to
the
man
like
a
man
instead
of
terrifying
a
poor
weak
woman
in
that
way
and
so
forth
i
ll
say
it
to
him
fast
enough
said
tom
only
i
want
you
to
hear
it
what
is
it
inquired
the
widow
looking
intently
in
tom
s
countenance
i
ll
astonish
you
said
tom
putting
his
hand
in
his
pocket
if
it
is
that
he
wants
money
said
the
widow
i
know
that
already
and
you
needn
t
trouble
pooh
nonsense
that
s
nothing
said
tom
smart
i
want
money
tain
t
oh
dear
what
can
it
be
exclaimed
the
poor
widow
don
t
be
frightened
said
tom
smart
he
slowly
drew
forth
the
letter
and
unfolded
it
you
won
t
scream
said
tom
doubtfully
no
no
replied
the
widow
let
me
see
you
won
t
go
fainting
away
or
any
of
that
nonsense
said
tom
no
no
returned
the
widow
hastily
and
don
t
run
out
and
blow
him
up
said
tom
because
i
ll
do
all
that
for
you
you
had
better
not
exert
well
well
said
the
widow
let
me
see
i
will
replied
tom
smart
and
with
these
words
he
placed
the
letter
in
the
widow
s
hand
gentlemen
i
have
heard
my
uncle
say
that
tom
smart
said
the
widow
s
lamentations
when
she
heard
the
disclosure
would
have
pierced
a
heart
of
stone
tom
was
certainly
very
but
they
pierced
his
to
the
very
core
the
widow
rocked
herself
to
and
fro
and
wrung
her
hands
oh
the
deception
and
villainy
of
the
man
said
the
widow
frightful
my
dear
ma
am
but
compose
yourself
said
tom
smart
oh
i
can
t
compose
myself
shrieked
the
widow
i
shall
never
find
anyone
else
i
can
love
so
much
oh
yes
you
will
my
dear
soul
said
tom
smart
letting
fall
a
shower
of
the
tears
in
pity
for
the
widow
s
misfortunes
tom
smart
in
the
energy
of
his
compassion
had
put
his
arm
round
the
widow
s
waist
and
the
widow
in
a
passion
of
grief
had
clasped
tom
s
hand
she
looked
up
in
tom
s
face
and
smiled
through
her
tears
tom
looked
down
in
hers
and
smiled
through
his
i
never
could
find
out
gentlemen
whether
tom
did
or
did
not
kiss
the
widow
at
that
particular
moment
he
used
to
tell
my
uncle
he
didn
t
but
i
have
my
doubts
about
it
between
ourselves
gentlemen
i
rather
think
he
did
at
all
events
tom
kicked
the
very
tall
man
out
at
the
front
door
half
an
hour
later
and
married
the
widow
a
month
after
and
he
used
to
drive
about
the
country
with
the
gig
with
the
red
wheels
and
the
vixenish
mare
with
the
fast
pace
till
he
gave
up
business
many
years
afterwards
and
went
to
france
with
his
wife
and
then
the
old
house
was
pulled
will
you
allow
me
to
ask
you
said
the
inquisitive
old
gentleman
what
became
of
the
chair
why
replied
the
bagman
it
was
observed
to
creak
very
much
on
the
day
of
the
wedding
but
tom
smart
couldn
t
say
for
certain
whether
it
was
with
pleasure
or
bodily
infirmity
he
rather
thought
it
was
the
latter
though
for
it
never
spoke
everybody
believed
the
story
didn
t
they
said
the
man
refilling
his
pipe
except
tom
s
enemies
replied
the
bagman
some
of
em
said
tom
invented
it
altogether
and
others
said
he
was
drunk
and
fancied
it
and
got
hold
of
the
wrong
trousers
by
mistake
before
he
went
to
bed
but
nobody
ever
minded
what
tom
smart
said
it
was
all
true
every
and
your
uncle
every
they
must
have
been
very
nice
men
both
of
em
said
the
man
yes
they
were
replied
the
bagman
very
nice
men
indeed
chapter
xv
in
which
is
given
a
faithful
portraiture
of
two
distinguished
persons
and
an
accurate
description
of
a
public
breakfast
in
their
house
and
grounds
which
public
breakfast
leads
to
the
recognition
of
an
old
acquaintance
and
the
commencement
of
another
chapter
pickwick
s
conscience
had
been
somewhat
reproaching
him
for
his
recent
neglect
of
his
friends
at
the
peacock
and
he
was
just
on
the
point
of
walking
forth
in
quest
of
them
on
the
third
morning
after
the
election
had
terminated
when
his
faithful
valet
put
into
his
hand
a
card
on
which
was
engraved
the
following
inscription
leo
hunter
the
den
eatanswill

s
said
sam
epigrammatically

person

ven

pickwick
a

replied

but
this
is
a
lady
s
card
said
pickwick
given
me
by
a
gen
l
m
n
howsoever
replied
sam
and
he
s
in
the
said
he
d
rather
wait
all
day
than
not
see
pickwick
on
hearing
this
determination
descended
to
the
room
where
sat
a
grave
man
who
started
up
on
his
entrance
and
said
with
an
air
of
profound
respect
mr
pickwick
i
presume
the
allow
me
sir
the
honour
of
grasping
your
hand
permit
me
sir
to
shake
it
said
the
grave
man
certainly
said
pickwick
the
stranger
shook
the
extended
hand
and
then
continued
we
have
heard
of
your
fame
sir
the
noise
of
your
antiquarian
discussion
has
reached
the
ears
of
leo
hunter
my
wife
sir
i
am
leo
hunter
the
stranger
paused
as
if
he
expected
that
pickwick
would
be
overcome
by
the
disclosure
but
seeing
that
he
remained
perfectly
calm
proceeded
my
wife
sir
leo
hunter
is
proud
to
number
among
her
acquaintance
all
those
who
have
rendered
themselves
celebrated
by
their
works
and
talents
permit
me
sir
to
place
in
a
conspicuous
part
of
the
list
the
name
of
pickwick
and
his
of
the
club
that
derives
its
name
from
i
shall
be
extremely
happy
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
such
a
lady
sir
replied
pickwick
you
it
sir
said
the
grave
man
morning
sir
we
give
a
public
breakfast
a
to
a
great
number
of
those
who
have
rendered
themselves
celebrated
by
their
works
and
talents
permit
leo
hunter
sir
to
have
the
gratification
of
seeing
you
at
the
with
great
pleasure
replied
pickwick
mrs
leo
hunter
has
many
of
these
breakfasts
sir
resumed
the
new
acquaintance
feasts
of
reason
sir
and
flows
of
soul
as
somebody
who
wrote
a
sonnet
to
leo
hunter
on
her
breakfasts
feelingly
and
originally
was
celebrated
for
his
works
and
talents
inquired
pickwick
he
was
sir
replied
the
grave
man
all
leo
hunter
s
acquaintances
are
it
is
her
ambition
sir
to
have
no
other
it
is
a
very
noble
ambition
said
pickwick
when
i
inform
leo
hunter
that
that
remark
fell
from
your
lips
sir
she
will
indeed
be
proud
said
the
grave
man
you
have
a
gentleman
in
your
train
who
has
produced
some
beautiful
little
poems
i
think
my
friend
snodgrass
has
a
great
taste
for
poetry
replied
pickwick
so
has
leo
hunter
sir
she
dotes
on
poetry
sir
she
adores
it
i
may
say
that
her
whole
soul
and
mind
are
wound
up
and
entwined
with
it
she
has
produced
some
delightful
pieces
herself
sir
you
may
have
met
with
her
ode
to
an
expiring
frog
i
don
t
think
i
have
said
pickwick
you
astonish
me
sir
said
leo
hunter
it
created
an
immense
sensation
it
was
signed
with
an
l
and
eight
stars
and
appeared
originally
in
a
lady
s
magazine
it
commenced
can
i
view
thee
panting
lying
on
thy
stomach
without
sighing
can
i
unmoved
see
thee
dying
on
a
log
expiring
frog
beautiful
said
pickwick
fine
said
leo
hunter
so
very
said
pickwick
the
next
verse
is
still
more
touching
shall
i
repeat
it
if
you
please
said
pickwick
it
runs
thus
said
the
grave
man
still
more
gravely
say
have
fiends
in
shape
of
boys
with
wild
halloo
and
brutal
noise
hunted
thee
from
marshy
joys
with
a
dog
expiring
frog
finely
expressed
said
pickwick
all
point
sir
said
leo
hunter
but
you
shall
hear
leo
hunter
repeat
it
she
can
do
justice
to
it
sir
she
will
repeat
it
in
character
sir
in
character
as
minerva
but
i
forgot
it
s
a
dear
me
said
pickwick
glancing
at
his
own
figure
i
can
t
possibly
can
t
sir
can
t
exclaimed
leo
hunter
solomon
lucas
the
jew
in
the
high
street
has
thousands
of
consider
sir
how
many
appropriate
characters
are
open
for
your
selection
plato
zeno
epicurus
pythagoras
all
founders
of
i
know
that
said
pickwick
but
as
i
can
not
put
myself
in
competition
with
those
great
men
i
can
not
presume
to
wear
their
the
grave
man
considered
deeply
for
a
few
seconds
and
then
said
on
reflection
sir
i
don
t
know
whether
it
would
not
afford
leo
hunter
greater
pleasure
if
her
guests
saw
a
gentleman
of
your
celebrity
in
his
own
costume
rather
than
in
an
assumed
one
i
may
venture
to
promise
an
exception
in
your
case
sir
yes
i
am
quite
certain
that
on
behalf
of
leo
hunter
i
may
venture
to
do
in
that
case
said
pickwick
i
shall
have
great
pleasure
in
but
i
waste
your
time
sir
said
the
grave
man
as
if
suddenly
recollecting
himself
i
know
its
value
sir
i
will
not
detain
you
i
may
tell
leo
hunter
then
that
she
may
confidently
expect
you
and
your
distinguished
friends
sir
i
am
proud
to
have
beheld
so
eminent
a
personage
not
a
step
sir
not
a
and
without
giving
pickwick
time
to
offer
remonstrance
or
denial
leo
hunter
stalked
gravely
away
pickwick
took
up
his
hat
and
repaired
to
the
peacock
but
winkle
had
conveyed
the
intelligence
of
the
there
before
him
mrs
pott
s
going
were
the
first
words
with
which
he
saluted
his
leader
is
she
said
pickwick
as
apollo
replied
winkle
only
pott
objects
to
the
he
is
right
he
is
quite
right
said
pickwick
emphatically
yes
so
she
s
going
to
wear
a
white
satin
gown
with
gold
they
ll
hardly
know
what
she
s
meant
for
will
they
inquired
snodgrass
of
course
they
will
replied
winkle
indignantly
they
ll
see
her
lyre
won
t
they
true
i
forgot
that
said
snodgrass
i
shall
go
as
a
bandit
interposed
tupman
what
said
pickwick
with
a
sudden
start
as
a
bandit
repeated
tupman
mildly
you
don
t
mean
to
say
said
pickwick
gazing
with
solemn
sternness
at
his
friend
you
don
t
mean
to
say
tupman
that
it
is
your
intention
to
put
yourself
into
a
green
velvet
jacket
with
a
tail
such
my
intention
sir
replied
tupman
warmly
and
why
not
sir
because
sir
said
pickwick
considerably
excited
because
you
are
too
old
too
old
exclaimed
tupman
and
if
any
further
ground
of
objection
be
wanting
continued
pickwick
you
are
too
fat
sir
said
tupman
his
face
suffused
with
a
crimson
glow
this
is
an
sir
replied
pickwick
in
the
same
tone
it
is
not
half
the
insult
to
you
that
your
appearance
in
my
presence
in
a
green
velvet
jacket
with
a
tail
would
be
to
sir
said
tupman
you
re
a
sir
said
pickwick
you
re
another
tupman
advanced
a
step
or
two
and
glared
at
pickwick
pickwick
returned
the
glare
concentrated
into
a
focus
by
means
of
his
spectacles
and
breathed
a
bold
defiance
snodgrass
and
winkle
looked
on
petrified
at
beholding
such
a
scene
between
two
such
men
sir
said
tupman
after
a
short
pause
speaking
in
a
low
deep
voice
you
have
called
me
i
have
said
pickwick
and
i
reiterate
the
and
a
so
you
are
there
was
a
fearful
pause
my
attachment
to
your
person
sir
said
tupman
speaking
in
a
voice
tremulous
with
emotion
and
tucking
up
his
wristbands
meanwhile
is
great
very
great
but
upon
that
person
i
must
take
summary
come
on
sir
replied
pickwick
stimulated
by
the
exciting
nature
of
the
dialogue
the
heroic
man
actually
threw
himself
into
a
paralytic
attitude
confidently
supposed
by
the
two
bystanders
to
have
been
intended
as
a
posture
of
defence
what
exclaimed
snodgrass
suddenly
recovering
the
power
of
speech
of
which
intense
astonishment
had
previously
bereft
him
and
rushing
between
the
two
at
the
imminent
hazard
of
receiving
an
application
on
the
temple
from
each
what
pickwick
with
the
eyes
of
the
world
upon
you
tupman
who
in
common
with
us
all
derives
a
lustre
from
his
undying
name
for
shame
gentlemen
for
the
unwonted
lines
which
momentary
passion
had
ruled
in
pickwick
s
clear
and
open
brow
gradually
melted
away
as
his
young
friend
spoke
like
the
marks
of
a
pencil
beneath
the
softening
influence
of
his
countenance
had
resumed
its
usual
benign
expression
ere
he
concluded
i
have
been
hasty
said
pickwick
very
hasty
tupman
your
the
dark
shadow
passed
from
tupman
s
face
as
he
warmly
grasped
the
hand
of
his
friend
i
have
been
hasty
too
said
he
no
no
interrupted
pickwick
the
fault
was
mine
you
will
wear
the
green
velvet
jacket
no
no
replied
tupman
to
oblige
me
you
will
resumed
pickwick
well
well
i
will
said
tupman
it
was
accordingly
settled
that
tupman
winkle
and
snodgrass
should
all
wear
thus
pickwick
was
led
by
the
very
warmth
of
his
own
good
feelings
to
give
his
consent
to
a
proceeding
from
which
his
better
judgment
would
have
recoiled
a
more
striking
illustration
of
his
amiable
character
could
hardly
have
been
conceived
even
if
the
events
recorded
in
these
pages
had
been
wholly
imaginary
leo
hunter
had
not
exaggerated
the
resources
of
solomon
lucas
his
wardrobe
was
extensive
very
extensive
not
strictly
classical
perhaps
not
quite
new
nor
did
it
contain
any
one
garment
made
precisely
after
the
fashion
of
any
age
or
time
but
everything
was
more
or
less
spangled
and
what
can
be
prettier
than
spangles
it
may
be
objected
that
they
are
not
adapted
to
the
daylight
but
everybody
knows
that
they
would
glitter
if
there
were
lamps
and
nothing
can
be
clearer
than
that
if
people
give
in
the
and
the
dresses
do
not
show
quite
as
well
as
they
would
by
night
the
fault
lies
solely
with
the
people
who
give
the
and
is
in
no
wise
chargeable
on
the
spangles
such
was
the
convincing
reasoning
of
solomon
lucas
and
influenced
by
such
arguments
did
tupman
winkle
and
snodgrass
engage
to
array
themselves
in
costumes
which
his
taste
and
experience
induced
him
to
recommend
as
admirably
suited
to
the
occasion
a
carriage
was
hired
from
the
town
arms
for
the
accommodation
of
the
pickwickians
and
a
chariot
was
ordered
from
the
same
repository
for
the
purpose
of
conveying
and
pott
to
leo
hunter
s
grounds
which
pott
as
a
delicate
acknowledgment
of
having
received
an
invitation
had
already
confidently
predicted
in
the
eatanswill
would
present
a
scene
of
varied
and
delicious
enchantment
a
bewildering
coruscation
of
beauty
and
talent
a
lavish
and
prodigal
display
of
hospitality
above
all
a
degree
of
splendour
softened
by
the
most
exquisite
taste
and
adornment
refined
with
perfect
harmony
and
the
chastest
good
keeping
compared
with
which
the
fabled
gorgeousness
of
eastern
fairyland
itself
would
appear
to
be
clothed
in
as
many
dark
and
murky
colours
as
must
be
the
mind
of
the
splenetic
and
unmanly
being
who
could
presume
to
taint
with
the
venom
of
his
envy
the
preparations
made
by
the
virtuous
and
highly
distinguished
lady
at
whose
shrine
this
humble
tribute
of
admiration
was
this
last
was
a
piece
of
biting
sarcasm
against
the
who
in
consequence
of
not
having
been
invited
at
all
had
been
through
four
numbers
affecting
to
sneer
at
the
whole
affair
in
his
very
largest
type
with
all
the
adjectives
in
capital
letters
the
morning
came
it
was
a
pleasant
sight
to
behold
tupman
in
full
brigand
s
costume
with
a
very
tight
jacket
sitting
like
a
pincushion
over
his
back
and
shoulders
the
upper
portion
of
his
legs
incased
in
the
velvet
shorts
and
the
lower
part
thereof
swathed
in
the
complicated
bandages
to
which
all
brigands
are
peculiarly
attached
it
was
pleasing
to
see
his
open
and
ingenuous
countenance
well
mustachioed
and
corked
looking
out
from
an
open
shirt
collar
and
to
contemplate
the
hat
decorated
with
ribbons
of
all
colours
which
he
was
compelled
to
carry
on
his
knee
inasmuch
as
no
known
conveyance
with
a
top
to
it
would
admit
of
any
man
s
carrying
it
between
his
head
and
the
roof
equally
humorous
and
agreeable
was
the
appearance
of
snodgrass
in
blue
satin
trunks
and
cloak
white
silk
tights
and
shoes
and
grecian
helmet
which
everybody
knows
and
if
they
do
not
solomon
lucas
did
to
have
been
the
regular
authentic
everyday
costume
of
a
troubadour
from
the
earliest
ages
down
to
the
time
of
their
final
disappearance
from
the
face
of
the
earth
all
this
was
pleasant
but
this
was
as
nothing
compared
with
the
shouting
of
the
populace
when
the
carriage
drew
up
behind
pott
s
chariot
which
chariot
itself
drew
up
at
pott
s
door
which
door
itself
opened
and
displayed
the
great
pott
accoutred
as
a
russian
officer
of
justice
with
a
tremendous
knout
in
his
hand
tastefully
typical
of
the
stern
and
mighty
power
of
the
eatanswill
and
the
fearful
lashings
it
bestowed
on
public
offenders
bravo
shouted
tupman
and
snodgrass
from
the
passage
when
they
beheld
the
walking
allegory
bravo
pickwick
was
heard
to
exclaim
from
the
passage
pott
shouted
the
populace
amid
these
salutations
pott
smiling
with
that
kind
of
bland
dignity
which
sufficiently
testified
that
he
felt
his
power
and
knew
how
to
exert
it
got
into
the
chariot
then
there
emerged
from
the
house
pott
who
would
have
looked
very
like
apollo
if
she
hadn
t
had
a
gown
on
conducted
by
winkle
who
in
his
coat
could
not
possibly
have
been
mistaken
for
anything
but
a
sportsman
if
he
had
not
borne
an
equal
resemblance
to
a
general
postman
last
of
all
came
pickwick
whom
the
boys
applauded
as
loud
as
anybody
probably
under
the
impression
that
his
tights
and
gaiters
were
some
remnants
of
the
dark
ages
and
then
the
two
vehicles
proceeded
towards
leo
hunter
s
weller
who
was
to
assist
in
waiting
being
stationed
on
the
box
of
that
in
which
his
master
was
seated
every
one
of
the
men
women
boys
girls
and
babies
who
were
assembled
to
see
the
visitors
in
their
screamed
with
delight
and
ecstasy
when
pickwick
with
the
brigand
on
one
arm
and
the
troubadour
on
the
other
walked
solemnly
up
the
entrance
never
were
such
shouts
heard
as
those
which
greeted
tupman
s
efforts
to
fix
the
hat
on
his
head
by
way
of
entering
the
garden
in
style
the
preparations
were
on
the
most
delightful
scale
fully
realising
the
prophetic
pott
s
anticipations
about
the
gorgeousness
of
eastern
fairyland
and
at
once
affording
a
sufficient
contradiction
to
the
malignant
statements
of
the
reptile
the
grounds
were
more
than
an
acre
and
a
quarter
in
extent
and
they
were
filled
with
people
never
was
such
a
blaze
of
beauty
and
fashion
and
literature
there
was
the
young
lady
who
did
the
poetry
in
the
eatanswill
in
the
garb
of
a
sultana
leaning
upon
the
arm
of
the
young
gentleman
who
did
the
review
department
and
who
was
appropriately
habited
in
a
marshal
s
uniform
the
boots
excepted
there
were
hosts
of
these
geniuses
and
any
reasonable
person
would
have
thought
it
honour
enough
to
meet
them
but
more
than
these
there
were
half
a
dozen
lions
from
london
authors
real
authors
who
had
written
whole
books
and
printed
them
afterwards
and
here
you
might
see
em
walking
about
like
ordinary
men
smiling
and
talking
aye
and
talking
pretty
considerable
nonsense
too
no
doubt
with
the
benign
intention
of
rendering
themselves
intelligible
to
the
common
people
about
them
moreover
there
was
a
band
of
music
in
pasteboard
caps
four
singers
in
the
costume
of
their
country
and
a
dozen
hired
waiters
in
the
costume
of
and
very
dirty
costume
too
and
above
all
there
was
leo
hunter
in
the
character
of
minerva
receiving
the
company
and
overflowing
with
pride
and
gratification
at
the
notion
of
having
called
such
distinguished
individuals
together
mr
pickwick
ma
am
said
a
servant
as
that
gentleman
approached
the
presiding
goddess
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
and
the
brigand
and
troubadour
on
either
arm
what
where
exclaimed
leo
hunter
starting
up
in
an
affected
rapture
of
surprise
here
said
pickwick
is
it
possible
that
i
have
really
the
gratification
of
beholding
pickwick
himself
ejaculated
leo
hunter
no
other
ma
am
replied
pickwick
bowing
very
low
permit
me
to
introduce
my
friends
tupman
winkle
snodgrass
to
the
authoress
of
the
expiring
very
few
people
but
those
who
have
tried
it
know
what
a
difficult
process
it
is
to
bow
in
green
velvet
smalls
and
a
tight
jacket
and
hat
or
in
blue
satin
trunks
and
white
silks
or
and
that
were
never
made
for
the
wearer
and
have
been
fixed
upon
him
without
the
remotest
reference
to
the
comparative
dimensions
of
himself
and
the
suit
never
were
such
distortions
as
tupman
s
frame
underwent
in
his
efforts
to
appear
easy
and
graceful
never
was
such
ingenious
posturing
as
his
friends
exhibited
mr
pickwick
said
leo
hunter
i
must
make
you
promise
not
to
stir
from
my
side
the
whole
day
there
are
hundreds
of
people
here
that
i
must
positively
introduce
you
you
are
very
kind
ma
am
said
pickwick
in
the
first
place
here
are
my
little
girls
i
had
almost
forgotten
them
said
minerva
carelessly
pointing
towards
a
couple
of
young
ladies
of
whom
one
might
be
about
twenty
and
the
other
a
year
or
two
older
and
who
were
dressed
in
very
juvenile
costumes
whether
to
make
them
look
young
or
their
mamma
younger
pickwick
does
not
distinctly
inform
us
they
are
very
beautiful
said
pickwick
as
the
juveniles
turned
away
after
being
presented
they
are
very
like
their
mamma
sir
said
pott
majestically
oh
you
naughty
man
exclaimed
leo
hunter
playfully
tapping
the
editor
s
arm
with
her
fan
minerva
with
a
fan
why
now
my
dear
hunter
said
pott
who
was
trumpeter
in
ordinary
at
the
den
you
know
that
when
your
picture
was
in
the
exhibition
of
the
royal
academy
last
year
everybody
inquired
whether
it
was
intended
for
you
or
your
youngest
daughter
for
you
were
so
much
alike
that
there
was
no
telling
the
difference
between
well
and
if
they
did
why
need
you
repeat
it
before
strangers
said
leo

bestowing
another
tap
on
the
slumbering
lion

the

count

screamed
leo
hunter
to
a
individual
in
a
foreign
uniform
who
was
passing
by
ah

want
me
said
the
count
turning
back
i
want
to
introduce
two
very
clever
people
to
each
other
said
leo

mr
pickwick
i
have
great
pleasure
in
introducing
you
to

she
added
in
a
hurried
whisper
to
pickwick
the
famous
foreigner
gathering

for
his
great
work
on
england
hem
count
smorltork
pickwick
saluted
the
count
with
all
the
reverence
due
to
so
great
a
man
and
the
count
drew
forth
a
set
of
tablets
what
you
say

the

smiling
graciously

the
gratified
leo

what

eh
i
see
that

and
the
count
was
proceeding
to
enter
pickwick
in
his
tablets
as
a
gentleman
of
the
long
robe
who
derived
his
name
from
the
profession
to
which
he

the

put

with

that

had
made
the
most
important
and
valuable
additions
to
his
stock
of

person
added
snodgrass
a
chorus
of
bystanders
took
up
the
shout
of
count
smorltork
s
praise
shook
their
heads
sagely
and
unanimously
cried
very
as
the
enthusiasm
in
count
smorltork
s
favour
ran
very
high
his
praises
might
have
been
sung
until
the
end
of
the
festivities
if
the
four
singers
had
not
ranged
themselves
in
front
of
a
small
to
look
picturesque
and
commenced
singing
their
national
songs
which
appeared
by
no
means
difficult
of
execution
inasmuch
as
the
grand
secret
seemed
to
be
that
three
of
the
singers
should
grunt
while
the
fourth
howled
this
interesting
performance
having
concluded
amidst
the
loud
plaudits
of
the
whole
company
a
boy
forthwith
proceeded
to
entangle
himself
with
the
rails
of
a
chair
and
to
jump
over
it
and
crawl
under
it
and
fall
down
with
it
and
do
everything
but
sit
upon
it
and
then
to
make
a
cravat
of
his
legs
and
tie
them
round
his
neck
and
then
to
illustrate
the
ease
with
which
a
human
being
can
be
made
to
look
like
a
magnified
toad
all
which
feats
yielded
high
delight
and
satisfaction
to
the
assembled
spectators
after
which
the
voice
of
pott
was
heard
to
chirp
faintly
forth
something
which
courtesy
interpreted
into
a
song
which
was
all
very
classical
and
strictly
in
character
because
apollo
was
himself
a
composer
and
composers
can
very
seldom
sing
their
own
music
or
anybody
else
s
either
this
was
succeeded
by
leo
hunter
s
recitation
of
her
ode
to
an
expiring
frog
which
was
encored
once
and
would
have
been
encored
twice
if
the
major
part
of
the
guests
who
thought
it
was
high
time
to
get
something
to
eat
had
not
said
that
it
was
perfectly
shameful
to
take
advantage
of
hunter
s
good
nature
so
although
leo
hunter
professed
her
perfect
willingness
to
recite
the
ode
again
her
kind
and
considerate
friends
wouldn
t
hear
of
it
on
any
account
and
the
refreshment
room
being
thrown
open
all
the
people
who
had
ever
been
there
before
scrambled
in
with
all
possible
leo
hunter
s
usual
course
of
proceedings
being
to
issue
cards
for
a
hundred
and
breakfast
for
fifty
or
in
other
words
to
feed
only
the
very
particular
lions
and
let
the
smaller
animals
take
care
of
themselves
where
is
pott
said
leo
hunter
as
she
placed
the
aforesaid
lions
around
her

said
the

from
the
remotest
end
of
the
room

beyond
all

of

unless
something
was
done
for
him
by
the
hostess

in

great

of
unnecessary
trouble

do

well
there

you

replied
the
unhappy
pott
with
a
grim
smile
alas
for
the
knout
the
nervous
arm
that
wielded
it
with
such
a
gigantic
force
on
public
characters
was
paralysed
beneath
the
glance
of
the
imperious
pott
leo
hunter
looked
round
her
in
triumph
count
smorltork
was
busily
engaged
in
taking
notes
of
the
contents
of
the
dishes
tupman
was
doing
the
honours
of
the
lobster
salad
to
several
lionesses
with
a
degree
of
grace
which
no
brigand
ever
exhibited
before
snodgrass
having
cut
out
the
young
gentleman
who
cut
up
the
books
for
the
eatanswill
was
engaged
in
an
impassioned
argument
with
the
young
lady
who
did
the
poetry
and
pickwick
was
making
himself
universally
agreeable
nothing
seemed
wanting
to
render
the
select
circle
complete
when
leo
hunter
whose
department
on
these
occasions
was
to
stand
about
in
doorways
and
talk
to
the
less
important
people
suddenly
called
out
my
dear
here
s
charles
oh
dear
said
leo
hunter
how
anxiously
i
have
been
expecting
him
pray
make
room
to
let
pass
tell
marshall
my
dear
to
come
up
to
me
directly
to
be
scolded
for
coming
so
coming
my
dear
ma

cried
a
voice
as
quick
as
i
can
crowds
of
people
full
room
hard
work
pickwick
s
knife
and
fork
fell
from
his
hand
he
stared
across
the
table
at
tupman
who
had
dropped
his
knife
and
fork
and
was
looking
as
if
he
were
about
to
sink
into
the
ground
without
further
notice
ah
cried
the
voice
as
its
owner
pushed
his
way
among
the
last
turks
officers
cavaliers
and
charles
the
seconds
that
remained
between
him
and
the
table
regular
mangle
baker

not
a

in
my
coat
after
all
this
squeezing
might
have
got
up
my
linen
as
i
came
along
ha
ha
not
a
bad
idea
that
queer
thing
to
have
it
mangled
when
it
s
upon
one
though
trying
process
with
these
broken
words
a
young
man
dressed
as
a
naval
officer
made
his
way
up
to
the
table
and
presented
to
the
astonished
pickwickians
the
identical
form
and
features
of
alfred
jingle
the
offender
had
barely
time
to
take
leo
hunter
s
proffered
hand
when
his
eyes
encountered
the
indignant
orbs
of
pickwick
hollo
said
jingle
quite
forgot
no
directions
to
postillion
give
em
at
once
back
in
a
the
servant
or

will
do
it
in

moment
said
leo
hunter
no
no
i
ll
do
it
shan
t
be
long
back
in
no
time
replied
jingle
with
these
words
he
disappeared
among
the
crowd
will
you
allow
me
to
ask
you
ma
am
said
the
excited
pickwick
rising
from
his
seat
who
that
young
man
is
and
where
he
resides
he
is
a
gentleman
of
fortune
pickwick
said
leo
hunter
to
whom
i
very
much
want
to
introduce
you
the
count
will
be
delighted
with
yes
yes
said
pickwick
hastily
his
residence
is
at
present
at
the
angel
at
at
bury
at
bury
edmunds
not
many
miles
from
here
but
dear
me
pickwick
you
are
not
going
to
leave
us
surely
pickwick
you
can
not
think
of
going
so
soon
but
long
before
leo
hunter
had
finished
speaking
pickwick
had
plunged
through
the
throng
and
reached
the
garden
whither
he
was
shortly
afterwards
joined
by
tupman
who
had
followed
his
friend
closely
it
s
of
no
use
said
tupman
he
has
i
know
it
said
pickwick
and
i
will
follow
follow
him
where
inquired
tupman
to
the
angel
at
bury
replied
pickwick
speaking
very
quickly
how
do
we
know
whom
he
is
deceiving
there
he
deceived
a
worthy
man
once
and
we
were
the
innocent
cause
he
shall
not
do
it
again
if
i
can
help
it
i
ll
expose
him
sam
where
s
my
servant
here
you
are
sir
said
weller
emerging
from
a
sequestered
spot
where
he
had
been
engaged
in
discussing
a
bottle
of
madeira
which
he
had
abstracted
from
the
an
hour
or
two
before
here
s
your
servant
sir
proud
o
the
title
as
the
living
skellinton
said
ven
they
show

follow
me
instantly
said
pickwick
tupman
if
i
stay
at
bury
you
can
join
me
there
when
i
write
till
then
remonstrances
were
useless
pickwick
was
roused
and
his
mind
was
made
up
tupman
returned
to
his
companions
and
in
another
hour
had
drowned
all
present
recollection
of
alfred
jingle
or
charles
in
an
exhilarating
quadrille
and
a
bottle
of
champagne
by
that
time
pickwick
and
sam
weller
perched
on
the
outside
of
a
were
every
succeeding
minute
placing
a
less
and
less
distance
between
themselves
and
the
good
old
town
of

edmunds
chapter
xvi
too
full
of
adventure
to
be
briefly
described
there
is
no
month
in
the
whole
year
in
which
nature
wears
a
more
beautiful
appearance
than
in
the
month
of
august
spring
has
many
beauties
and
may
is
a
fresh
and
blooming
month
but
the
charms
of
this
time
of
year
are
enhanced
by
their
contrast
with
the
winter
season
august
has
no
such
advantage
it
comes
when
we
remember
nothing
but
clear
skies
green
fields
and
flowers
when
the
recollection
of
snow
and
ice
and
bleak
winds
has
faded
from
our
minds
as
completely
as
they
have
disappeared
from
the
earth
and
yet
what
a
pleasant
time
it
is
orchards
and
cornfields
ring
with
the
hum
of
labour
trees
bend
beneath
the
thick
clusters
of
rich
fruit
which
bow
their
branches
to
the
ground
and
the
corn
piled
in
graceful
sheaves
or
waving
in
every
light
breath
that
sweeps
above
it
as
if
it
wooed
the
sickle
tinges
the
landscape
with
a
golden
hue
a
mellow
softness
appears
to
hang
over
the
whole
earth
the
influence
of
the
season
seems
to
extend
itself
to
the
very
wagon
whose
slow
motion
across
the
reaped
field
is
perceptible
only
to
the
eye
but
strikes
with
no
harsh
sound
upon
the
ear
as
the
coach
rolls
swiftly
past
the
fields
and
orchards
which
skirt
the
road
groups
of
women
and
children
piling
the
fruit
in
sieves
or
gathering
the
scattered
ears
of

pause
for
an
instant
from
their
labour
and
shading
the
face
with
a
still
browner
hand
gaze
upon
the
passengers
with
curious
eyes
while
some
stout
urchin
too
small
to
work
but
too
mischievous
to
be
left
at
home
scrambles
over
the
side
of
the
basket
in
which
he
has
been
deposited
for
security
and
kicks
and
screams
with
delight
the
reaper
stops
in
his
work
and
stands
with
folded
arms
looking
at
the
vehicle
as
it
whirls
past
and
the
rough
bestow
a
sleepy
glance
upon
the
smart
coach
team
which
says
as
plainly
as
a
horse
s
glance
can
it
s
all
very
fine
to
look
at
but
slow
going
over
a
heavy
field
is
better
than
warm
work
like
that
upon
a
dusty
road
after
you
cast
a
look
behind
you
as
you
turn
a
corner
of
the
road
the
women
and
children
have
resumed
their
labour
the
reaper
once
more
stoops
to
his
work
the
have
moved
on
and
all
are
again
in
motion
the
influence
of
a
scene
like
this
was
not
lost
upon
the
mind
of
pickwick
intent
upon
the
resolution
he
had
formed
of
exposing
the
real
character
of
the
nefarious
jingle
in
any
quarter
in
which
he
might
be
pursuing
his
fraudulent
designs
he
sat
at
first
taciturn
and
contemplative
brooding
over
the
means
by
which
his
purpose
could
be
best
attained
by
degrees
his
attention
grew
more
and
more
attracted
by
the
objects
around
him
and
at
last
he
derived
as
much
enjoyment
from
the
ride
as
if
it
had
been
undertaken
for
the
pleasantest
reason
in
the
world
delightful
prospect

as

made
a
rise
in
their
profession
takes
up
their
quarters
there
sometimes
but
it
s
generally
the
starving
houseless
creeturs
as
roll
themselves
in
the
dark
corners
o

lonesome
places
poor

and
pray

inquired
pickwick
the

just
a
cheap
lodgin
house
where

a
what

replied
sam
ven
the
lady
and
gen
l
m
n
as
keeps
the
first
begun
business
they
used
to
make
the
beds
on
the

but
this
wouldn

do
at
no
price
cos
instead
o
taking
a
moderate
twopenn
orth
o
sleep
the
lodgers
used
to
lie
there
half
the
day
so
now
they
has
two

apart
and
three
from
the
floor
which
goes
right

said
sam
suddenly
breaking
off
in
his
loquacious
discourse

is
replied
pickwick
the
coach
rattled
through
the
streets
of
a
handsome
little
town
of
thriving
and
cleanly
appearance
and
stopped
before
a
large
inn
situated
in
a
wide
open
street
nearly
facing
the
old
abbey
and
this
said
pickwick
looking
up
is
the
angel

but
some
caution
is
necessary

a
private
room
and
do
not
mention
my
name
you
right
as
a
trivet
sir
replied
weller
with
a
wink
of
intelligence
and
having
dragged
pickwick
s
portmanteau
from
the
hind
boot
into
which
it
had
been
hastily
thrown
when
they
joined
the
coach
at
eatanswill
weller
disappeared
on
his
errand
a
private
room
was
speedily
engaged
and
into
it
pickwick
was
ushered
without
delay
now
sam
said
pickwick
the
first
thing
to
be
done
is
to
order
dinner
sir
interposed
weller
it
s
wery
late
ah
so

is
said
pickwick
looking
at
his
watch
you

might
adwise
sir
added
weller
i

just
have

un
till

as

sir
as
the
servant
girl
said
afore
she
drank
the
of
i
think
you
are
right
sam
said
pickwick
but
i
must
first
ascertain
that
he
is
in
the
house
and
not
likely
to
go
leave
that
to
me
sir
said
sam
let
me
order
you
a
snug
little
dinner
and
make
my
inquiries
below
while
it
s
ready
i
could
worm
ev
ry
secret
out
o
the
boots
s
heart
in
five
minutes
do
so
said
pickwick
and
weller
at
once
retired
in
half
an
hour
pickwick
was
seated
at
a
very
satisfactory
dinner
and
in
weller
returned
with
the
intelligence
that
charles
had
ordered
his
private
room
to
be
retained
for
him
until
further
notice
he
was
going
to
spend
the
evening
at
some
private
house
in
the
neighbourhood
had
ordered
the
boots
to
sit
up
until
his
return
and
had
taken
his
servant
with
him
now
sir
argued
weller
when
he
had
concluded
his
report
if
i
can
get
a
talk
with
this
here
servant
in
the
mornin
he
ll
tell
me
all
his
master
s
how
do
you
know
that
interposed
pickwick
bless
your
heart
sir
servants
always
do
replied
weller
oh
ah
i
forgot
that
said
pickwick
then
you
can
arrange
what
s
best
to
be
done
sir
and
we
can
act
as
it
appeared
that
this
was
the
best
arrangement
that
could
be
made
it
was
finally
agreed
upon
weller
by
his
master
s
permission
retired
to
spend
the
evening
in
his
own
way
and
was
shortly
afterwards
elected
by
the
unanimous
voice
of
the
assembled
company
into
the
taproom
chair
in
which
honourable
post
he
acquitted
himself
so
much
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
that
their
roars
of
laughter
and
approbation
penetrated
to
pickwick
s
bedroom
and
shortened
the
term
of
his
natural
rest
by
at
least
three
hours
early
on
the
ensuing
morning
weller
was
dispelling
all
the
feverish
remains
of
the
previous
evening
s
conviviality
through
the
instrumentality
of
a
halfpenny
having
induced
a
young
gentleman
attached
to
the
stable
department
by
the
offer
of
that
coin
to
pump
over
his
head
and
face
until
he
was
perfectly
restored
when
he
was
attracted
by
the
appearance
of
a
young
fellow
in
coloured
livery
who
was
sitting
on
a
bench
in
the
yard
reading
what
appeared
to
be
a
with
an
air
of
deep
abstraction
but
who
occasionally
stole
a
glance
at
the
individual
under
the
pump
as
if
he
took
some
interest
in
his
proceedings
nevertheless
you
re
a
rum
un
to
look
at
you
are
thought
weller
the
first
time
his
eyes
encountered
the
glance
of
the
stranger
in
the
mulberry
suit
who
had
a
large
sallow
ugly
face
very
sunken
eyes
and
a
gigantic
head
from
which
depended
a
quantity
of
lank
black
hair
you
re
a
rum
un
thought
weller
and
thinking
this
he
went
on
washing
himself
and
thought
no
more
about
him
still
the
man
kept
glancing
from
his
to
sam
and
from
sam
to
his
as
if
he
wanted
to
open
a
conversation
so
at
last
sam
by
way
of
giving
him
an
opportunity
said
with
a
familiar
nod
how
are
you
governor
i
am
happy
to
say
i
am
pretty
well
sir
said
the
man
speaking
with
great
deliberation
and
closing
the
book
i
hope
you
are
the
same
sir
why
if
i
felt
less
like
a
walking
i
shouldn
t
be
quite
so
staggery
this
mornin
replied
sam

this
house

the
mulberry
man
replied
in
the
affirmative
how
was
it

t
one
of
us
last
night
inquired
sam
scrubbing
his
face
with
the
towel

of
the
jolly

as
conwivial
as
a
live
trout
in
a
lime
basket
added
weller
in
an
undertone
i
was
out
last
night
with
my
master
replied
the
stranger
what
s
his
name
inquired
weller
colouring
up
very
red
with
sudden
excitement
and
the
friction
of
the
towel
combined
said
the
mulberry
man

hand

weller
advancing
i
should
like
to

the
mulberry
man
with
great
simplicity
of
manner

much
that
i
wanted
to
speak
to
you
from
the
very
first
moment
i
saw
you
under
the
did
you
though
upon
my
word
now

that
curious
wery
sing
ler
said
sam
inwardly
congratulating
himself
upon
the
softness
of
the
stranger
what
s
your
name
my
patriarch
and
a
wery
good
name
it
is
only
one
i
know
that

t
got
a
nickname
to
it
what
s
the
other
name
trotter
said
the
stranger
what
is
yours
sam
bore
in
mind
his
master
s
caution
and
replied
my
name
s
walker
my
master
s
name
s
wilkins
will
you
take
a
drop
o
somethin
this
mornin
trotter
trotter
acquiesced
in
this
agreeable
proposal
and
having
deposited
his
book
in
his
coat
pocket
accompanied
weller
to
the
tap
where
they
were
soon
occupied
in
discussing
an
exhilarating
compound
formed
by
mixing
together
in
a
pewter
vessel
certain
quantities
of
british
hollands
and
the
fragrant
essence
of
the
clove
and
what
sort
of
a
place
have
you
got
inquired
sam
as
he
filled
his
companion
s
glass
for
the
second
time
bad
said
job
smacking
his
lips
very
you
don
t
mean
that
said
sam
i
do
indeed
worse
than
that
my
master
s
going
to
be
yes
and
worse
than
that
too
he
s
going
to
run
away
with
an
immense
rich
heiress
from
what
a
dragon
said
sam
refilling
his
companion
s
glass
it
s
some
in
this
town
i
suppose
ain
t
it
now
although
this
question
was
put
in
the
most
careless
tone
imaginable
job
trotter
plainly
showed
by
gestures
that
he
perceived
his
new
friend
s
anxiety
to
draw
forth
an
answer
to
it
he
emptied
his
glass
looked
mysteriously
at
his
companion
winked
both
of
his
small
eyes
one
after
the
other
and
finally
made
a
motion
with
his
arm
as
if
he
were
working
an
imaginary
thereby
intimating
that
he
trotter
considered
himself
as
undergoing
the
process
of
being
pumped
by
samuel
weller
no
no
said
trotter
in
conclusion
that
s
not
to
be
told
to
everybody
that
is
a
secret
a
great
secret
as
the
mulberry
man
said
this
he
turned
his
glass
upside
down
by
way
of
reminding
his
companion
that
he
had
nothing
left
wherewith
to
slake
his
thirst
sam
observed
the
hint
and
feeling
the
delicate
manner
in
which
it
was
conveyed
ordered
the
pewter
vessel
to
be
refilled
whereat
the
small
eyes
of
the
mulberry
man
glistened
and
so
it
s
a
secret
said
sam
i
should
rather
suspect
it
was
said
the
mulberry
man
sipping
his
liquor
with
a
complacent
face
i
suppose
your
mas
r
s
wery
rich
said
sam
trotter
smiled
and
holding
his
glass
in
his
left
hand
gave
four
distinct
slaps
on
the
pockets
of
his
mulberry
indescribables
with
his
right
as
if
to
intimate
that
his
master
might
have
done
the
same
without
alarming
anybody
much
by
the
chinking
of
coin
ah
said
sam
that
s
the
game
is
it
the
mulberry
man
nodded
significantly
well
and
don
t
you
think
old
feller
remonstrated
weller
that
if
you
let
your
master
take
in
this
here
young
lady
you
re
a
precious
rascal
i
know
that
said
job
trotter
turning
upon
his
companion
a
countenance
of
deep
contrition
and
groaning
slightly
i
know
that
and
that
s
what
it
is
that
preys
upon
my
mind
but
what
am
i
to
do
do
said
sam
to
the
missis
and
give
up
your
who
d
believe
me
replied
job
trotter
the
young
lady
s
considered
the
very
picture
of
innocence
and
discretion
she
d
deny
it
and
so
would
my
master
who
d
believe
me
i
should
lose
my
place
and
get
indicted
for
a
conspiracy
or
some
such
thing
that
s
all
i
should
take
by
my
there
s
somethin
in
that
said
sam
ruminating
there
s
somethin
in
if
i
knew
any
respectable
gentleman
who
would
take
the
matter
up
continued
trotter
i
might
have
some
hope
of
preventing
the
elopement
but
there
s
the
same
difficulty
walker
just
the
same
i
know
no
gentleman
in
this
strange
place
and
ten
to
one
if
i
did
whether
he
would
believe
my
come
this
way
said
sam
suddenly
jumping
up
and
grasping
the
mulberry
man
by
the
arm
my
mas
r
s
the
man
you
want
i
and
after
a
slight
resistance
on
the
part
of
job
trotter
sam
led
his
friend
to
the
apartment
of
pickwick
to
whom
he
presented
him
together
with
a
brief
summary
of
the
dialogue
we
have
just
repeated
i
am
very
sorry
to
betray
my
master
sir
said
job
trotter
applying
to
his
eyes
a
pink
checked
about
six
inches
square
the
feeling
does
you
a
great
deal
of
honour
replied
pickwick
but
it
is
your
duty
i
know
it
is
my
duty
sir
replied
job
with
great
emotion
we
should
all
try
to
discharge
our
duty
sir
and
i
humbly
endeavour
to
discharge
mine
sir
but
it
is
a
hard
trial
to
betray
a
master
sir
whose
clothes
you
wear
and
whose
bread
you
eat
even
though
he
is
a
scoundrel
you
are
a
very
good
fellow
said
pickwick
much
affected
an
honest
come
come
interposed
sam
who
had
witnessed
trotter
s
tears
with
considerable
impatience
blow
this
ere
bis
ness
it
won
t
do
no
good
this
won
sam
said
pickwick
reproachfully
i
am
sorry
to
find
that
you
have
so
little
respect
for
this
young
man
s
his
feelin
s
is
all
wery
well
sir
replied
weller
and
as
they
re
so
wery
fine
and
it
s
a
pity
he
should
lose
em
i
think
he
d
better
keep
em
in
his
own
buzzum
than
let
em
ewaporate
in
hot
water
specially
as
they
do
no
good
tears
never
yet
wound
up
a
clock
or
worked
a
steam
ingin
the
next
time
you
go
out
to
a
smoking
party
young
fellow
fill
your
pipe
with
that
ere
reflection
and
for
the
present
just
put
that
bit
of
pink
gingham
into
your
pocket
tain
t
so
handsome
that
you
need
keep
waving
it
about
as
if
you
was
a
my
man
is
in
the
right
said
pickwick
accosting
job
although
his
mode
of
expressing
his
opinion
is
somewhat
homely
and
occasionally
he
is
sir
very
right
said
trotter
and
i
will
give
way
no
very
well
said
pickwick
now
where
is
this
it
is
a
large
old
red
brick
house
just
outside
the
town
sir
replied
job
trotter
and
when
said
pickwick
when
is
this
villainous
design
to
be
carried
into
execution
when
is
this
elopement
to
take
place
sir
replied
job
exclaimed
pickwick
this
very
night
sir
replied
job
trotter
that
is
what
alarms
me
so
instant
measures
must
be
taken
said
pickwick
i
will
see
the
lady
who
keeps
the
establishment
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
said
job
but
that
course
of
proceeding
will
never
why
not
inquired
pickwick
my
master
sir
is
a
very
artful
i
know
he
is
said
pickwick
and
he
has
so
wound
himself
round
the
old
lady
s
heart
sir
resumed
job
that
she
would
believe
nothing
to
his
prejudice
if
you
went
down
on
your
bare
knees
and
swore
it
especially
as
you
have
no
proof
but
the
word
of
a
servant
who
for
anything
she
knows
and
my
master
would
be
sure
to
say
so
was
discharged
for
some
fault
and
does
this
in
what
had
better
be
done
then
said
pickwick
nothing
but
taking
him
in
the
very
act
of
eloping
will
convince
the
old
lady
sir
replied
job
all
them
old
cats
their
heads
agin
milestones
observed
weller
in
a
parenthesis
but
this
taking
him
in
the
very
act
of
elopement
would
be
a
very
difficult
thing
to
accomplish
i
fear
said
pickwick
i
don
t
know
sir
said
trotter
after
a
few
moments
reflection
i
think
it
might
be
very
easily
how
was
pickwick
s
inquiry
why
replied
trotter
my
master
and
i
being
in
the
confidence
of
the
two
servants
will
be
secreted
in
the
kitchen
at
ten
o
clock
when
the
family
have
retired
to
rest
we
shall
come
out
of
the
kitchen
and
the
young
lady
out
of
her
bedroom
a
will
be
waiting
and
away
we
well
said
pickwick
well
sir
i
have
been
thinking
that
if
you
were
in
waiting
in
the
garden
behind
alone
alone
said
pickwick
why
alone
i
thought
it
very
natural
replied
job
that
the
old
lady
wouldn
t
like
such
an
unpleasant
discovery
to
be
made
before
more
persons
than
can
possibly
be
helped
the
young
lady
too
sir
consider
her
you
are
very
right
said
pickwick
the
consideration
evinces
your
delicacy
of
feeling
go
on
you
are
very
well
sir
i
have
been
thinking
that
if
you
were
waiting
in
the
back
garden
alone
and
i
was
to
let
you
in
at
the
door
which
opens
into
it
from
the
end
of
the
passage
at
exactly
eleven
o
clock
you
would
be
just
in
the
very
moment
of
time
to
assist
me
in
frustrating
the
designs
of
this
bad
man
by
whom
i
have
been
unfortunately
here
trotter
sighed
deeply
don
t
distress
yourself
on
that
account
said
pickwick
if
he
had
one
grain
of
the
delicacy
of
feeling
which
distinguishes
you
humble
as
your
station
is
i
should
have
some
hopes
of
job
trotter
bowed
low
and
in
spite
of
weller
s
previous
remonstrance
the
tears
again
rose
to
his
eyes
i
never
see
such
a
feller
said
sam
blessed
if
i
don
t
think
he
s
got
a
main
in
his
head
as
is
always
turned
sam
said
pickwick
with
great
severity
hold
your
wery
well
sir
replied
weller
i
don
t
like
this
plan
said
pickwick
after
deep
meditation
why
can
not
i
communicate
with
the
young
lady
s
friends
because
they
live
one
hundred
miles
from
here
sir
responded
job
trotter
that
s
a
clincher
said
weller
aside
then
this
garden
resumed
pickwick
how
am
i
to
get
into
it
the
wall
is
very
low
sir
and
your
servant
will
give
you
a
leg
my
servant
will
give
me
a
leg
up
repeated
pickwick
mechanically
you
will
be
sure
to
be
near
this
door
that
you
speak
of
you
can
not
mistake
it
sir
it
s
the
only
one
that
opens
into
the
garden
tap
at
it
when
you
hear
the
clock
strike
and
i
will
open
it
i
don
t
like
the
plan
said
pickwick
but
as
i
see
no
other
and
as
the
happiness
of
this
young
lady
s
whole
life
is
at
stake
i
adopt
it
i
shall
be
sure
to
be
thus
for
the
second
time
did
pickwick
s
innate
involve
him
in
an
enterprise
from
which
he
would
most
willingly
have
stood
aloof
what
is
the
name
of
the
house
inquired
pickwick
westgate
house
sir
you
turn
a
little
to
the
right
when
you
get
to
the
end
of
the
town
it
stands
by
itself
some
little
distance
off
the
high
road
with
the
name
on
a
brass
plate
on
the
i
know
it
said
pickwick
i
observed
it
once
before
when
i
was
in
this
town
you
may
depend
upon
trotter
made
another
bow
and
turned
to
depart
when
pickwick
thrust
a
guinea
into
his
hand
you
re
a
fine
fellow
said
pickwick
and
i
admire
your
goodness
of
heart
no
thanks
remember
eleven
o
there
is
no
fear
of
my
forgetting
it
sir
replied
job
trotter
with
these
words
he
left
the
room
followed
by
sam
i
say
said
the
latter
not
a
bad
notion
that
ere
crying
i
d
cry
like
a
spout
in
a
shower
on
such
good
terms
how
do
you
do
it
it
comes
from
the
heart
walker
replied
job
solemnly
morning
you
re
a
soft
customer
you
are
we
ve
got
it
all
out
o
you
anyhow
thought
weller
as
job
walked
away
we
can
not
state
the
precise
nature
of
the
thoughts
which
passed
through
trotter
s
mind
because
we
don
t
know
what
they
were
the
day
wore
on
evening
came
and
at
a
little
before
ten
o
clock
sam
weller
reported
that
jingle
and
job
had
gone
out
together
that
their
luggage
was
packed
up
and
that
they
had
ordered
a
chaise
the
plot
was
evidently
in
execution
as
trotter
had
foretold
ten
o
clock
arrived
and
it
was
time
for
pickwick
to
issue
forth
on
his
delicate
errand
resisting
sam
s
tender
of
his
greatcoat
in
order
that
he
might
have
no
encumbrance
in
scaling
the
wall
he
set
forth
followed
by
his
attendant
there
was
a
bright
moon
but
it
was
behind
the
clouds
it
was
a
fine
dry
night
but
it
was
most
uncommonly
dark
paths
hedges
fields
houses
and
trees
were
enveloped
in
one
deep
shade
the
atmosphere
was
hot
and
sultry
the
summer
lightning
quivered
faintly
on
the
verge
of
the
horizon
and
was
the
only
sight
that
varied
the
dull
gloom
in
which
everything
was
wrapped
sound
there
was
none
except
the
distant
barking
of
some
restless
they
found
the
house
read
the
brass
plate
walked
round
the
wall
and
stopped
at
that
portion
of
it
which
divided
them
from
the
bottom
of
the
garden
you
will
return
to
the
inn
sam
when
you
have
assisted
me
over
said
pickwick
wery
well
and
you
will
sit
up
till
i
cert
nly
take
hold
of
my
leg
and
when
i
say
over
raise
me
all
right
having
settled
these
preliminaries
pickwick
grasped
the
top
of
the
wall
and
gave
the
word
over
which
was
literally
obeyed
whether
his
body
partook
in
some
degree
of
the
elasticity
of
his
mind
or
whether
weller
s
notions
of
a
gentle
push
were
of
a
somewhat
rougher
description
than
pickwick
s
the
immediate
effect
of
his
assistance
was
to
jerk
that
immortal
gentleman
completely
over
the
wall
on
to
the
bed
beneath
where
after
crushing
three
and
a
tree
he
finally
alighted
at
full
length
you
ha
n
t
hurt
yourself
i
hope
sir
said
sam
in
a
loud
whisper
as
soon
as
he
had
recovered
from
the
surprise
consequent
upon
the
mysterious
disappearance
of
his
master
i
have
not
hurt
sam
certainly
replied
pickwick
from
the
other
side
of
the
wall
but
i
rather
think
that
hurt
i
hope
not
sir
said
sam
never
mind
said
pickwick
rising
it
s
nothing
but
a
few
scratches
go
away
or
we
shall
be
with
stealthy
steps
sam
weller
departed
leaving
pickwick
alone
in
the
garden
lights
occasionally
appeared
in
the
different
windows
of
the
house
or
glanced
from
the
staircases
as
if
the
inmates
were
retiring
to
rest
not
caring
to
go
too
near
the
door
until
the
appointed
time
pickwick
crouched
into
an
angle
of
the
wall
and
awaited
its
arrival
it
was
a
situation
which
might
well
have
depressed
the
spirits
of
many
a
man
pickwick
however
felt
neither
depression
nor
misgiving
he
knew
that
his
purpose
was
in
the
main
a
good
one
and
he
placed
implicit
reliance
on
the
job
it
was
dull
certainly
not
to
say
dreary
but
a
contemplative
man
can
always
employ
himself
in
meditation
pickwick
had
meditated
himself
into
a
doze
when
he
was
roused
by
the
chimes
of
the
neighbouring
church
ringing
out
the
hour
eleven
that
s
the
time
thought
pickwick
getting
cautiously
on
his
feet
he
looked
up
at
the
house
the
lights
had
disappeared
and
the
shutters
were
closed
all
in
bed
no
doubt
he
walked
on
tiptoe
to
the
door
and
gave
a
gentle
tap
two
or
three
minutes
passing
without
any
reply
he
gave
another
tap
rather
louder
and
then
another
rather
louder
than
that
at
length
the
sound
of
feet
was
audible
upon
the
stairs
and
then
the
light
of
a
candle
shone
through
the
keyhole
of
the
door
there
was
a
good
deal
of
unchaining
and
unbolting
and
the
door
was
slowly
opened
now
the
door
opened
outwards
and
as
the
door
opened
wider
and
wider
pickwick
receded
behind
it
more
and
more
what
was
his
astonishment
when
he
just
peeped
out
by
way
of
caution
to
see
that
the
person
who
had
opened
it
was
not
job
trotter
but
a
with
a
candle
in
her
hand
pickwick
drew
in
his
head
again
with
the
swiftness
displayed
by
that
admirable
melodramatic
performer
punch
when
he
lies
in
wait
for
the
comedian
with
the
tin
box
of
music
it
must
have
been
the
cat
sarah
said
the
girl
addressing
herself
to
some
one
in
the
house
puss
puss
puss
tit
tit
but
no
animal
being
decoyed
by
these
blandishments
the
girl
slowly
closed
the
door
and
it
leaving
pickwick
drawn
up
straight
against
the
wall
this
is
very
curious
thought
pickwick
they
are
sitting
up
beyond
their
usual
hour
i
suppose
extremely
unfortunate
that
they
should
have
chosen
this
night
of
all
others
for
such
a
purpose
and
with
these
thoughts
pickwick
cautiously
retired
to
the
angle
of
the
wall
in
which
he
had
been
before
ensconced
waiting
until
such
time
as
he
might
deem
it
safe
to
repeat
the
signal
he
had
not
been
here
five
minutes
when
a
vivid
flash
of
lightning
was
followed
by
a
loud
peal
of
thunder
that
crashed
and
rolled
away
in
the
distance
with
a
terrific
noise
then
came
another
flash
of
lightning
brighter
than
the
other
and
a
second
peal
of
thunder
louder
than
the
first
and
then
down
came
the
rain
with
a
force
and
fury
that
swept
everything
before
it
pickwick
was
perfectly
aware
that
a
tree
is
a
very
dangerous
neighbour
in
a
thunderstorm
he
had
a
tree
on
his
right
a
tree
on
his
left
a
third
before
him
and
a
fourth
behind
if
he
remained
where
he
was
he
might
fall
the
victim
of
an
accident
if
he
showed
himself
in
the
centre
of
the
garden
he
might
be
consigned
to
a
constable
once
or
twice
he
tried
to
scale
the
wall
but
having
no
other
legs
this
time
than
those
with
which
nature
had
furnished
him
the
only
effect
of
his
struggles
was
to
inflict
a
variety
of
very
unpleasant
gratings
on
his
knees
and
shins
and
to
throw
him
into
a
state
of
the
most
profuse
perspiration
what
a
dreadful
situation
said
pickwick
pausing
to
wipe
his
brow
after
this
exercise
he
looked
up
at
the
house
all
was
dark
they
must
be
gone
to
bed
now
he
would
try
the
signal
again
he
walked
on
tiptoe
across
the
moist
gravel
and
tapped
at
the
door
he
held
his
breath
and
listened
at
the
no
reply
very
odd
another
knock
he
listened
again
there
was
a
low
whispering
inside
and
then
a
voice
cried
who
s
there
that
s
not
job
thought
pickwick
hastily
drawing
himself
straight
up
against
the
wall
again
it
s
a
he
had
scarcely
had
time
to
form
this
conclusion
when
a
window
above
stairs
was
thrown
up
and
three
or
four
female
voices
repeated
the
query
who
s
there
pickwick
dared
not
move
hand
or
foot
it
was
clear
that
the
whole
establishment
was
roused
he
made
up
his
mind
to
remain
where
he
was
until
the
alarm
had
subsided
and
then
by
a
supernatural
effort
to
get
over
the
wall
or
perish
in
the
attempt
like
all
pickwick
s
determinations
this
was
the
best
that
could
be
made
under
the
circumstances
but
unfortunately
it
was
founded
upon
the
assumption
that
they
would
not
venture
to
open
the
door
again
what
was
his
discomfiture
when
he
heard
the
chain
and
bolts
withdrawn
and
saw
the
door
slowly
opening
wider
and
wider
he
retreated
into
the
corner
step
by
step
but
do
what
he
would
the
interposition
of
his
own
person
prevented
its
being
opened
to
its
utmost
width
who
s
there
screamed
a
numerous
chorus
of
treble
voices
from
the
staircase
inside
consisting
of
the
spinster
lady
of
the
establishment
three
teachers
five
female
servants
and
thirty
boarders
all
dressed
and
in
a
forest
of
of
course
pickwick
didn
t
say
who
was
there
and
then
the
burden
of
the
chorus
changed
into
lor
i
am
so
cook
said
the
lady
abbess
who
took
care
to
be
on
the
top
stair
the
very
last
of
the
group
cook
why
don
t
you
go
a
little
way
into
the
garden
please
ma
am
i
don
t
like
responded
the
cook
lor
what
a
stupid
thing
that
cook
is
said
the
thirty
boarders
cook
said
the
lady
abbess
with
great
dignity
don
t
answer
me
if
you
please
i
insist
upon
your
looking
into
the
garden
here
the
cook
began
to
cry
and
the
housemaid
said
it
was
a
shame
for
which
partisanship
she
received
a
month
s
warning
on
the
spot
do
you
hear
cook
said
the
lady
abbess
stamping
her
foot
impatiently
don
t
you
hear
your
missis
cook
said
the
three
teachers
what
an
impudent
thing
that
cook
is
said
the
thirty
boarders
the
unfortunate
cook
thus
strongly
urged
advanced
a
step
or
two
and
holding
her
candle
just
where
it
prevented
her
from
seeing
at
all
declared
there
was
nothing
there
and
it
must
have
been
the
wind
the
door
was
just
going
to
be
closed
in
consequence
when
an
inquisitive
boarder
who
had
been
peeping
between
the
hinges
set
up
a
fearful
screaming
which
called
back
the
cook
and
housemaid
and
all
the
more
adventurous
in
no
time
what
is
the
matter
with
miss

the

no
sooner

appalling
cry
than
she
retreated
to
her
own
bedroom
the
door
and
fainted
away
comfortably
the
boarders
and
the
teachers
and
the
servants
fell
back
upon
the
stairs
and
upon
each
other
and
never
was
such
a
screaming
and
fainting
and
struggling
beheld
in
the
midst
of
the
tumult
pickwick
emerged
from
his
concealment
and
presented
himself
amongst
them

pickwick

the

situation

said
pickwick
exerting
his
lungs
to
the
utmost
pitch
call
her
only
be
quiet
and
call
her
and
you
shall
hear
it
might
have
been
pickwick
s
appearance
or
it
might
have
been
his
manner
or
it
might
have
been
the
temptation
irresistible
to
a
female
mind
of
hearing
something
at
present
enveloped
in
mystery
that
reduced
the
more
reasonable
portion
of
the
establishment
some
four
individuals
to
a
state
of
comparative
quiet
by
them
it
was
proposed
as
a
test
of
pickwick
s
sincerity
that
he
should
immediately
submit
to
personal
restraint
and
that
gentleman
having
consented
to
hold
a
conference
with
miss
tomkins
from
the
interior
of
a
closet
in
which
the
day
boarders
hung
their
bonnets
and
he
at
once
stepped
into
it
of
his
own
accord
and
was
securely
locked
in
this
revived
the
others
and
miss
tomkins
having
been
brought
to
and
brought
down
the
conference
began
what
did
you
do
in
my
garden
man
said
miss
tomkins
in
a
faint
voice
i
came
to
warn
you
that
one
of
your
young
ladies
was
going
to
elope
night
replied
pickwick
from
the
interior
of
the
closet
elope
exclaimed
miss
tomkins
the
three
teachers
the
thirty
boarders
and
the
five
servants

and
base
conspiracy

said
miss
tomkins
to
the
writing
and
ciphering
governess
it
s
my
opinion
miss
tomkins
said
the
writing
and
ciphering
governess
that
his
manservant

think
he

a
madman
miss
tomkins
and
the
other
s

i
think
you
are
very
right
miss
gwynn
responded
miss
tomkins
let
two
of
the
servants
repair
to
the
angel
and
let
the
others
remain
here
to
protect
so
two
of
the
servants
were
despatched
to
the
angel
in
search
of
samuel
weller
and
the
remaining
three
stopped
behind
to
protect
miss
tomkins
and
the
three
teachers
and
the
thirty
boarders
and
pickwick
sat
down
in
the
closet
beneath
a
grove
of
and
awaited
the
return
of
the
messengers
with
all
the
philosophy
and
fortitude
he
could
summon
to
his
aid
an
hour
and
a
half
elapsed
before
they
came
back
and
when
they
did
come
pickwick
recognised
in
addition
to
the
voice
of
samuel
weller
two
other
voices
the
tones
of
which
struck
familiarly
on
his
ear
but
whose
they
were
he
could
not
for
the
life
of
him
call
to
mind
a
very
brief
conversation
ensued
the
door
was
unlocked
pickwick
stepped
out
of
the
closet
and
found
himself
in
the
presence
of
the
whole
establishment
of
westgate
house
mr
samuel
weller
and
old
wardle
and
his
destined
trundle
my
dear
friend
said
pickwick
running
forward
and
grasping
wardle
s
hand
my
dear
friend
pray
for
heaven
s
sake
explain
to
this
lady
the
unfortunate
and
dreadful
situation
in
which
i
am
placed
you
must
have
heard
it
from
my
servant
say
at
all
events
my
dear
fellow
that
i
am
neither
a
robber
nor
a
i
have
said
so
my
dear
friend
i
have
said
so
already
replied
wardle
shaking
the
right
hand
of
his
friend
while
trundle
shook
the
left
and
whoever
says
or
has
said
he
is
interposed
weller
stepping
forward
says
that
which
is
not
the
truth
but
so
far
from
it
on
the
contrary
quite
the
rewerse
and
if
there
s
any
number
o
men
on
these
here
premises
as
has
said
so
i
shall
be
wery
happy
to
give
em
all
a
wery
convincing
proof
o
their
being
mistaken
in
this
here
wery
room
if
these
wery
respectable
ladies
ll
have
the
goodness
to
retire
and
order
em
up
one
at
a
having
delivered
this
defiance
with
great
volubility
weller
struck
his
open
palm
emphatically
with
his
clenched
fist
and
winked
pleasantly
on
miss
tomkins
the
intensity
of
whose
horror
at
his
supposing
it
within
the
bounds
of
possibility
that
there
could
be
any
men
on
the
premises
of
westgate
house
establishment
for
young
ladies
it
is
impossible
to
describe
pickwick
s
explanation
having
already
been
partially
made
was
soon
concluded
but
neither
in
the
course
of
his
walk
home
with
his
friends
nor
afterwards
when
seated
before
a
blazing
fire
at
the
supper
he
so
much
needed
could
a
single
observation
be
drawn
from
him
he
seemed
bewildered
and
amazed
once
and
only
once
he
turned
round
to
wardle
and
said
how
did
you
come
here
trundle
and
i
came
down
here
for
some
good
shooting
on
the
first
replied
wardle
we
arrived
and
were
astonished
to
hear
from
your
servant
that
you
were
here
too
but
i
am
glad
you
are
said
the
old
fellow
slapping
him
on
the
back
i
am
glad
you
are
we
shall
have
a
jovial
party
on
the
first
and
we
ll
give
winkle
another
chance
eh
old
boy
pickwick
made
no
reply
he
did
not
even
ask
after
his
friends
at
dingley
dell
and
shortly
afterwards
retired
for
the
night
desiring
sam
to
fetch
his
candle
when
he
rung
the
bell
did
ring
in
due
course
and
weller
presented
himself
sam
said
pickwick
looking
out
from
under
the
sir
said
weller
pickwick
paused
and
weller
snuffed
the
candle
sam
said
pickwick
again
as
if
with
a
desperate
effort
sir
said
weller
once
more
where

that
trotter
job
sir

pickwick
half
choking
just

whenever

in

tremendous
blow

chapter
xvii
showing
that
an
attack
of
rheumatism
in
some
cases
acts
as
a
quickener
to
inventive
genius
the
constitution
of
pickwick
though
able
to
sustain
a
very
considerable
amount
of
exertion
and
fatigue
was
not
proof
against
such
a
combination
of
attacks
as
he
had
undergone
on
the
memorable
night
recorded
in
the
last
chapter
the
process
of
being
washed
in
the
night
air
and
in
a
closet
is
as
dangerous
as
it
is
peculiar
pickwick
was
laid
up
with
an
attack
of
rheumatism
but
although
the
bodily
powers
of
the
great
man
were
thus
impaired
his
mental
energies
retained
their
pristine
vigour
his
spirits
were
elastic
his
was
restored
even
the
vexation
consequent
upon
his
recent
adventure
had
vanished
from
his
mind
and
he
could
join
in
the
hearty
laughter
which
any
allusion
to
it
excited
in
wardle
without
anger
and
without
embarrassment
nay
more
during
the
two
days
pickwick
was
confined
to
bed
sam
was
his
constant
attendant
on
the
first
he
endeavoured
to
amuse
his
master
by
anecdote
and
conversation
on
the
second
pickwick
demanded
his
and
pen
and
ink
and
was
deeply
engaged
during
the
whole
day
on
the
third
being
able
to
sit
up
in
his
bedchamber
he
despatched
his
valet
with
a
message
to
wardle
and
trundle
intimating
that
if
they
would
take
their
wine
there
that
evening
they
would
greatly
oblige
him
the
invitation
was
most
willingly
accepted
and
when
they
were
seated
over
their
wine
pickwick
with
sundry
blushes
produced
the
following
little
tale
as
having
been
edited
by
himself
during
his
recent
indisposition
from
his
notes
of
weller
s
unsophisticated
recital
the
parish
clerk
a
tale
of
true
love
once
upon
a
time
in
a
very
small
country
town
at
a
considerable
distance
from
london
there
lived
a
little
man
named
nathaniel
pipkin
who
was
the
parish
clerk
of
the
little
town
and
lived
in
a
little
house
in
the
little
high
street
within
ten
minutes
walk
from
the
little
church
and
who
was
to
be
found
every
day
from
nine
till
four
teaching
a
little
learning
to
the
little
boys
nathaniel
pipkin
was
a
harmless
inoffensive
being
with
a
nose
and
rather
legs
a
cast
in
his
eye
and
a
halt
in
his
gait
and
he
divided
his
time
between
the
church
and
his
school
verily
believing
that
there
existed
not
on
the
face
of
the
earth
so
clever
a
man
as
the
curate
so
imposing
an
apartment
as
the
or
so
a
seminary
as
his
own
once
and
only
once
in
his
life
nathaniel
pipkin
had
seen
a
bishop
a
real
bishop
with
his
arms
in
lawn
sleeves
and
his
head
in
a
wig
he
had
seen
him
walk
and
heard
him
talk
at
a
confirmation
on
which
momentous
occasion
nathaniel
pipkin
was
so
overcome
with
reverence
and
awe
when
the
aforesaid
bishop
laid
his
hand
on
his
head
that
he
fainted
right
clean
away
and
was
borne
out
of
church
in
the
arms
of
the
beadle
this
was
a
great
event
a
tremendous
era
in
nathaniel
pipkin
s
life
and
it
was
the
only
one
that
had
ever
occurred
to
ruffle
the
smooth
current
of
his
quiet
existence
when
happening
one
fine
afternoon
in
a
fit
of
mental
abstraction
to
raise
his
eyes
from
the
slate
on
which
he
was
devising
some
tremendous
problem
in
compound
addition
for
an
offending
urchin
to
solve
they
suddenly
rested
on
the
blooming
countenance
of
maria
lobbs
the
only
daughter
of
old
lobbs
the
great
saddler
over
the
way
now
the
eyes
of
pipkin
had
rested
on
the
pretty
face
of
maria
lobbs
many
a
time
and
oft
before
at
church
and
elsewhere
but
the
eyes
of
maria
lobbs
had
never
looked
so
bright
the
cheeks
of
maria
lobbs
had
never
looked
so
ruddy
as
upon
this
particular
occasion
no
wonder
then
that
nathaniel
pipkin
was
unable
to
take
his
eyes
from
the
countenance
of
miss
lobbs
no
wonder
that
miss
lobbs
finding
herself
stared
at
by
a
young
man
withdrew
her
head
from
the
window
out
of
which
she
had
been
peeping
and
shut
the
casement
and
pulled
down
the
blind
no
wonder
that
nathaniel
pipkin
immediately
thereafter
fell
upon
the
young
urchin
who
had
previously
offended
and
cuffed
and
knocked
him
about
to
his
heart
s
content
all
this
was
very
natural
and
there
s
nothing
at
all
to
wonder
at
about
it
it
matter
of
wonder
though
that
anyone
of
nathaniel
pipkin
s
retiring
disposition
nervous
temperament
and
most
particularly
diminutive
income
should
from
this
day
forth
have
dared
to
aspire
to
the
hand
and
heart
of
the
only
daughter
of
the
fiery
old
lobbs
of
old
lobbs
the
great
saddler
who
could
have
bought
up
the
whole
village
at
one
stroke
of
his
pen
and
never
felt
the
outlay
old
lobbs
who
was
well
known
to
have
heaps
of
money
invested
in
the
bank
at
the
nearest
market
town
who
was
reported
to
have
countless
and
inexhaustible
treasures
hoarded
up
in
the
little
iron
safe
with
the
big
keyhole
over
the
in
the
back
parlour
and
who
it
was
well
known
on
festive
occasions
garnished
his
board
with
a
real
silver
teapot
ewer
and
which
he
was
wont
in
the
pride
of
his
heart
to
boast
should
be
his
daughter
s
property
when
she
found
a
man
to
her
mind
i
repeat
it
to
be
matter
of
profound
astonishment
and
intense
wonder
that
nathaniel
pipkin
should
have
had
the
temerity
to
cast
his
eyes
in
this
direction
but
love
is
blind
and
nathaniel
had
a
cast
in
his
eye
and
perhaps
these
two
circumstances
taken
together
prevented
his
seeing
the
matter
in
its
proper
light
now
if
old
lobbs
had
entertained
the
most
remote
or
distant
idea
of
the
state
of
the
affections
of
nathaniel
pipkin
he
would
just
have
razed
the
to
the
ground
or
exterminated
its
master
from
the
surface
of
the
earth
or
committed
some
other
outrage
and
atrocity
of
an
equally
ferocious
and
violent
description
for
he
was
a
terrible
old
fellow
was
lobbs
when
his
pride
was
injured
or
his
blood
was
up
swear
such
trains
of
oaths
would
come
rolling
and
pealing
over
the
way
sometimes
when
he
was
denouncing
the
idleness
of
the
bony
apprentice
with
the
thin
legs
that
nathaniel
pipkin
would
shake
in
his
shoes
with
horror
and
the
hair
of
the
pupils
heads
would
stand
on
end
with
fright
well
day
after
day
when
school
was
over
and
the
pupils
gone
did
nathaniel
pipkin
sit
himself
down
at
the
front
window
and
while
he
feigned
to
be
reading
a
book
throw
sidelong
glances
over
the
way
in
search
of
the
bright
eyes
of
maria
lobbs
and
he
hadn
t
sat
there
many
days
before
the
bright
eyes
appeared
at
an
upper
window
apparently
deeply
engaged
in
reading
too
this
was
delightful
and
gladdening
to
the
heart
of
nathaniel
pipkin
it
was
something
to
sit
there
for
hours
together
and
look
upon
that
pretty
face
when
the
eyes
were
cast
down
but
when
maria
lobbs
began
to
raise
her
eyes
from
her
book
and
dart
their
rays
in
the
direction
of
nathaniel
pipkin
his
delight
and
admiration
were
perfectly
boundless
at
last
one
day
when
he
knew
old
lobbs
was
out
nathaniel
pipkin
had
the
temerity
to
kiss
his
hand
to
maria
lobbs
and
maria
lobbs
instead
of
shutting
the
window
and
pulling
down
the
blind
kissed
him
and
smiled
upon
which
nathaniel
pipkin
determined
that
come
what
might
he
would
develop
the
state
of
his
feelings
without
further
delay
a
prettier
foot
a
gayer
heart
a
more
dimpled
face
or
a
smarter
form
never
bounded
so
lightly
over
the
earth
they
graced
as
did
those
of
maria
lobbs
the
old
saddler
s
daughter
there
was
a
roguish
twinkle
in
her
sparkling
eyes
that
would
have
made
its
way
to
far
less
susceptible
bosoms
than
that
of
nathaniel
pipkin
and
there
was
such
a
joyous
sound
in
her
merry
laugh
that
the
sternest
misanthrope
must
have
smiled
to
hear
it
even
old
lobbs
himself
in
the
very
height
of
his
ferocity
couldn
t
resist
the
coaxing
of
his
pretty
daughter
and
when
she
and
her
cousin
kate
an
arch
bewitching
little
person
made
a
dead
set
upon
the
old
man
together
as
to
say
the
truth
they
very
often
did
he
could
have
refused
them
nothing
even
had
they
asked
for
a
portion
of
the
countless
and
inexhaustible
treasures
which
were
hidden
from
the
light
in
the
iron
safe
nathaniel
pipkin
s
heart
beat
high
within
him
when
he
saw
this
enticing
little
couple
some
hundred
yards
before
him
one
summer
s
evening
in
the
very
field
in
which
he
had
many
a
time
strolled
about
till
and
pondered
on
the
beauty
of
maria
lobbs
but
though
he
had
often
thought
then
how
briskly
he
would
walk
up
to
maria
lobbs
and
tell
her
of
his
passion
if
he
could
only
meet
her
he
felt
now
that
she
was
unexpectedly
before
him
all
the
blood
in
his
body
mounting
to
his
face
manifestly
to
the
great
detriment
of
his
legs
which
deprived
of
their
usual
portion
trembled
beneath
him
when
they
stopped
to
gather
a
hedge
flower
or
listen
to
a
bird
nathaniel
pipkin
stopped
too
and
pretended
to
be
absorbed
in
meditation
as
indeed
he
really
was
for
he
was
thinking
what
on
earth
he
should
ever
do
when
they
turned
back
as
they
inevitably
must
in
time
and
meet
him
face
to
face
but
though
he
was
afraid
to
make
up
to
them
he
couldn
t
bear
to
lose
sight
of
them
so
when
they
walked
faster
he
walked
faster
when
they
lingered
he
lingered
and
when
they
stopped
he
stopped
and
so
they
might
have
gone
on
until
the
darkness
prevented
them
if
kate
had
not
looked
slyly
back
and
encouragingly
beckoned
nathaniel
to
advance
there
was
something
in
kate
s
manner
that
was
not
to
be
resisted
and
so
nathaniel
pipkin
complied
with
the
invitation
and
after
a
great
deal
of
blushing
on
his
part
and
immoderate
laughter
on
that
of
the
wicked
little
cousin
nathaniel
pipkin
went
down
on
his
knees
on
the
dewy
grass
and
declared
his
resolution
to
remain
there
for
ever
unless
he
were
permitted
to
rise
the
accepted
lover
of
maria
lobbs
upon
this
the
merry
laughter
of
miss
lobbs
rang
through
the
calm
evening
air
without
seeming
to
disturb
it
though
it
had
such
a
pleasant
sound
and
the
wicked
little
cousin
laughed
more
immoderately
than
before
and
nathaniel
pipkin
blushed
deeper
than
ever
at
length
maria
lobbs
being
more
strenuously
urged
by
the
little
man
turned
away
her
head
and
whispered
her
cousin
to
say
or
at
all
events
kate
did
say
that
she
felt
much
honoured
by
pipkin
s
addresses
that
her
hand
and
heart
were
at
her
father
s
disposal
but
that
nobody
could
be
insensible
to
pipkin
s
merits
as
all
this
was
said
with
much
gravity
and
as
nathaniel
pipkin
walked
home
with
maria
lobbs
and
struggled
for
a
kiss
at
parting
he
went
to
bed
a
happy
man
and
dreamed
all
night
long
of
softening
old
lobbs
opening
the
strong
box
and
marrying
maria
the
next
day
nathaniel
pipkin
saw
old
lobbs
go
out
upon
his
old
gray
pony
and
after
a
great
many
signs
at
the
window
from
the
wicked
little
cousin
the
object
and
meaning
of
which
he
could
by
no
means
understand
the
bony
apprentice
with
the
thin
legs
came
over
to
say
that
his
master
wasn
t
coming
home
all
night
and
that
the
ladies
expected
pipkin
to
tea
at
six
o
clock
precisely
how
the
lessons
were
got
through
that
day
neither
nathaniel
pipkin
nor
his
pupils
knew
any
more
than
you
do
but
they
were
got
through
somehow
and
after
the
boys
had
gone
nathaniel
pipkin
took
till
full
six
o
clock
to
dress
himself
to
his
satisfaction
not
that
it
took
long
to
select
the
garments
he
should
wear
inasmuch
as
he
had
no
choice
about
the
matter
but
the
putting
of
them
on
to
the
best
advantage
and
the
touching
of
them
up
previously
was
a
task
of
no
inconsiderable
difficulty
or
importance
there
was
a
very
snug
little
party
consisting
of
maria
lobbs
and
her
cousin
kate
and
three
or
four
romping
girls
nathaniel
pipkin
had
ocular
demonstration
of
the
fact
that
the
rumours
of
old
lobbs
s
treasures
were
not
exaggerated
there
were
the
real
solid
silver
teapot
and
on
the
table
and
real
silver
spoons
to
stir
the
tea
with
and
real
china
cups
to
drink
it
out
of
and
plates
of
the
same
to
hold
the
cakes
and
toast
in
the
only
in
the
whole
place
was
another
cousin
of
maria
lobbs
s
and
a
brother
of
kate
whom
maria
lobbs
called
henry
and
who
seemed
to
keep
maria
lobbs
all
to
himself
up
in
one
corner
of
the
table
it
s
a
delightful
thing
to
see
affection
in
families
but
it
may
be
carried
rather
too
far
and
nathaniel
pipkin
could
not
help
thinking
that
maria
lobbs
must
be
very
particularly
fond
of
her
relations
if
she
paid
as
much
attention
to
all
of
them
as
to
this
individual
cousin
after
tea
too
when
the
wicked
little
cousin
proposed
a
game
at
blind
man
s
buff
it
somehow
or
other
happened
that
nathaniel
pipkin
was
nearly
always
blind
and
whenever
he
laid
his
hand
upon
the
male
cousin
he
was
sure
to
find
that
maria
lobbs
was
not
far
off
and
though
the
wicked
little
cousin
and
the
other
girls
pinched
him
and
pulled
his
hair
and
pushed
chairs
in
his
way
and
all
sorts
of
things
maria
lobbs
never
seemed
to
come
near
him
at
all
and
once
once
nathaniel
pipkin
could
have
sworn
he
heard
the
sound
of
a
kiss
followed
by
a
faint
remonstrance
from
maria
lobbs
and
a
laugh
from
her
female
friends
all
this
was
odd
very
odd
and
there
is
no
saying
what
nathaniel
pipkin
might
or
might
not
have
done
in
consequence
if
his
thoughts
had
not
been
suddenly
directed
into
a
new
channel
the
circumstance
which
directed
his
thoughts
into
a
new
channel
was
a
loud
knocking
at
the
street
door
and
the
person
who
made
this
loud
knocking
at
the
street
door
was
no
other
than
old
lobbs
himself
who
had
unexpectedly
returned
and
was
hammering
away
like
a
for
he
wanted
his
supper
the
alarming
intelligence
was
no
sooner
communicated
by
the
bony
apprentice
with
the
thin
legs
than
the
girls
tripped
upstairs
to
maria
lobbs
s
bedroom
and
the
male
cousin
and
nathaniel
pipkin
were
thrust
into
a
couple
of
closets
in
the
room
for
want
of
any
better
places
of
concealment
and
when
maria
lobbs
and
the
wicked
little
cousin
had
stowed
them
away
and
put
the
room
to
rights
they
opened
the
street
door
to
old
lobbs
who
had
never
left
off
knocking
since
he
first
began
now
it
did
unfortunately
happen
that
old
lobbs
being
very
hungry
was
monstrous
cross
nathaniel
pipkin
could
hear
him
growling
away
like
an
old
mastiff
with
a
sore
throat
and
whenever
the
unfortunate
apprentice
with
the
thin
legs
came
into
the
room
so
surely
did
old
lobbs
commence
swearing
at
him
in
a
most
saracenic
and
ferocious
manner
though
apparently
with
no
other
end
or
object
than
that
of
easing
his
bosom
by
the
discharge
of
a
few
superfluous
oaths
at
length
some
supper
which
had
been
warming
up
was
placed
on
the
table
and
then
old
lobbs
fell
to
in
regular
style
and
having
made
clear
work
of
it
in
no
time
kissed
his
daughter
and
demanded
his
pipe
nature
had
placed
nathaniel
pipkin
s
knees
in
very
close
juxtaposition
but
when
he
heard
old
lobbs
demand
his
pipe
they
knocked
together
as
if
they
were
going
to
reduce
each
other
to
powder
for
depending
from
a
couple
of
hooks
in
the
very
closet
in
which
he
stood
was
a
large
pipe
which
pipe
he
himself
had
seen
in
the
mouth
of
old
lobbs
regularly
every
afternoon
and
evening
for
the
last
five
years
the
two
girls
went
downstairs
for
the
pipe
and
upstairs
for
the
pipe
and
everywhere
but
where
they
knew
the
pipe
was
and
old
lobbs
stormed
away
meanwhile
in
the
most
wonderful
manner
at
last
he
thought
of
the
closet
and
walked
up
to
it
it
was
of
no
use
a
little
man
like
nathaniel
pipkin
pulling
the
door
inwards
when
a
great
strong
fellow
like
old
lobbs
was
pulling
it
outwards
old
lobbs
gave
it
one
tug
and
open
it
flew
disclosing
nathaniel
pipkin
standing
bolt
upright
inside
and
shaking
with
apprehension
from
head
to
foot
bless
us
what
an
appalling
look
old
lobbs
gave
him
as
he
dragged
him
out
by
the
collar
and
held
him
at
arm
s
length
why
what
the
devil
do
you
want
here
said
old
lobbs
in
a
fearful
voice
nathaniel
pipkin
could
make
no
reply
so
old
lobbs
shook
him
backwards
and
forwards
for
two
or
three
minutes
by
way
of
arranging
his
ideas
for
him
what
do
you
want
here
roared
lobbs
i
suppose
you
have
come
after
my
daughter
now
old
lobbs
merely
said
this
as
a
sneer
for
he
did
not
believe
that
mortal
presumption
could
have
carried
nathaniel
pipkin
so
far
what
was
his
indignation
when
that
poor
man
replied
yes
i
did
lobbs
i
did
come
after
your
daughter
i
love
her
why
you
snivelling
puny
villain
gasped
old
lobbs
paralysed
by
the
atrocious
confession
what
do
you
mean
by
that
say
this
to
my
face
damme
i
ll
throttle
you
it
is
by
no
means
improbable
that
old
lobbs
would
have
carried
his
threat
into
execution
in
the
excess
of
his
rage
if
his
arm
had
not
been
stayed
by
a
very
unexpected
apparition
to
wit
the
male
cousin
who
stepping
out
of
his
closet
and
walking
up
to
old
lobbs
said
i
can
not
allow
this
harmless
person
sir
who
has
been
asked
here
in
some
girlish
frolic
to
take
upon
himself
in
a
very
noble
manner
the
fault
if
fault
it
is
which
i
am
guilty
of
and
am
ready
to
avow
i
love
your
daughter
sir
and
i
came
here
for
the
purpose
of
meeting
old
lobbs
opened
his
eyes
very
wide
at
this
but
not
wider
than
nathaniel
pipkin
you
did
said
lobbs
at
last
finding
breath
to
speak
i
and
i
forbade
you
this
house
long
you
did
or
i
should
not
have
been
here
clandestinely
i
am
sorry
to
record
it
of
old
lobbs
but
i
think
he
would
have
struck
the
cousin
if
his
pretty
daughter
with
her
bright
eyes
swimming
in
tears
had
not
clung
to
his
arm
don
t
stop
him
maria
said
the
young
man
if
he
has
the
will
to
strike
me
let
him
i
would
not
hurt
a
hair
of
his
gray
head
for
the
riches
of
the
the
old
man
cast
down
his
eyes
at
this
reproof
and
they
met
those
of
his
daughter
i
have
hinted
once
or
twice
before
that
they
were
very
bright
eyes
and
though
they
were
tearful
now
their
influence
was
by
no
means
lessened
old
lobbs
turned
his
head
away
as
if
to
avoid
being
persuaded
by
them
when
as
fortune
would
have
it
he
encountered
the
face
of
the
wicked
little
cousin
who
half
afraid
for
her
brother
and
half
laughing
at
nathaniel
pipkin
presented
as
bewitching
an
expression
of
countenance
with
a
touch
of
slyness
in
it
too
as
any
man
old
or
young
need
look
upon
she
drew
her
arm
coaxingly
through
the
old
man
s
and
whispered
something
in
his
ear
and
do
what
he
would
old
lobbs
couldn
t
help
breaking
out
into
a
smile
while
a
tear
stole
down
his
cheek
at
the
same
time
five
minutes
after
this
the
girls
were
brought
down
from
the
bedroom
with
a
great
deal
of
giggling
and
modesty
and
while
the
young
people
were
making
themselves
perfectly
happy
old
lobbs
got
down
the
pipe
and
smoked
it
and
it
was
a
remarkable
circumstance
about
that
particular
pipe
of
tobacco
that
it
was
the
most
soothing
and
delightful
one
he
ever
smoked
nathaniel
pipkin
thought
it
best
to
keep
his
own
counsel
and
by
so
doing
gradually
rose
into
high
favour
with
old
lobbs
who
taught
him
to
smoke
in
time
and
they
used
to
sit
out
in
the
garden
on
the
fine
evenings
for
many
years
afterwards
smoking
and
drinking
in
great
state
he
soon
recovered
the
effects
of
his
attachment
for
we
find
his
name
in
the
parish
register
as
a
witness
to
the
marriage
of
maria
lobbs
to
her
cousin
and
it
also
appears
by
reference
to
other
documents
that
on
the
night
of
the
wedding
he
was
incarcerated
in
the
village
cage
for
having
in
a
state
of
extreme
intoxication
committed
sundry
excesses
in
the
streets
in
all
of
which
he
was
aided
and
abetted
by
the
bony
apprentice
with
the
thin
chapter
xviii
briefly
illustrative
of
two
points
first
the
power
of
hysterics
and
secondly
the
force
of
circumstances
for
two
days
after
the
hunter
s
the
pickwickians
remained
at
eatanswill
anxiously
awaiting
the
arrival
of
some
intelligence
from
their
revered
leader
tupman
and
snodgrass
were
once
again
left
to
their
own
means
of
amusement
for
winkle
in
compliance
with
a
most
pressing
invitation
continued
to
reside
at
pott
s
house
and
to
devote
his
time
to
the
companionship
of
his
amiable
lady
nor
was
the
occasional
society
of
pott
himself
wanting
to
complete
their
felicity
deeply
immersed
in
the
intensity
of
his
speculations
for
the
public
weal
and
the
destruction
of
the
it
was
not
the
habit
of
that
great
man
to
descend
from
his
mental
pinnacle
to
the
humble
level
of
ordinary
minds
on
this
occasion
however
and
as
if
expressly
in
compliment
to
any
follower
of
pickwick
s
he
unbent
relaxed
stepped
down
from
his
pedestal
and
walked
upon
the
ground
benignly
adapting
his
remarks
to
the
comprehension
of
the
herd
and
seeming
in
outward
form
if
not
in
spirit
to
be
one
of
them
such
having
been
the
demeanour
of
this
celebrated
public
character
towards
winkle
it
will
be
readily
imagined
that
considerable
surprise
was
depicted
on
the
countenance
of
the
latter
gentleman
when
as
he
was
sitting
alone
in
the
the
door
was
hastily
thrown
open
and
as
hastily
closed
on
the
entrance
of
pott
who
stalking
majestically
towards
him
and
thrusting
aside
his
proffered
hand
ground
his
teeth
as
if
to
put
a
sharper
edge
on
what
he
was
about
to
utter
and
exclaimed
in
a
voice
serpent
sir
exclaimed
winkle
starting
from
his
chair
serpent
sir
repeated
pott
raising
his
voice
and
then
suddenly
depressing
it
i
said
serpent
sir
make
the
most
of
when
you
have
parted
with
a
man
at
two
o
clock
in
the
morning
on
terms
of
the
utmost
and
he
meets
you
again
at
nine
and
greets
you
as
a
serpent
it
is
not
unreasonable
to
conclude
that
something
of
an
unpleasant
nature
has
occurred
meanwhile
so
winkle
thought
he
returned
pott
s
gaze
of
stone
and
in
compliance
with
that
gentleman
s
request
proceeded
to
make
the
most
he
could
of
the
the
most
however
was
nothing
at
all
so
after
a
profound
silence
of
some
minutes
duration
he
said
serpent
sir
serpent
pott
what
can
you
mean
sir
this
is
pleasantry
sir
exclaimed
pott
with
a
motion
of
the
hand
indicative
of
a
strong
desire
to
hurl
the
britannia
metal
teapot
at
the
head
of
the
visitor
pleasantry
sir
but
no
i
will
be
calm
i
will
be
calm
sir
in
proof
of
his
calmness
pott
flung
himself
into
a
chair
and
foamed
at
the
mouth
my
dear
sir
interposed
winkle
replied
pott
how
dare
you
address
me
as
dear
sir
sir
how
dare
you
look
me
in
the
face
and
do
it
sir
well
sir
if
you
come
to
that
responded
winkle
how
dare
you
look
me
in
the
face
and
call
me
a
serpent
sir
because
you
are
one
replied
pott
prove
it
sir
said
winkle
warmly
prove
a
malignant
scowl
passed
over
the
profound
face
of
the
editor
as
he
drew
from
his
pocket
the
of
that
morning
and
laying
his
finger
on
a
particular
paragraph
threw
the
journal
across
the
table
to
winkle
that
gentleman
took
it
up
and
read
as
follows
our
obscure
and
filthy
contemporary
in
some
disgusting
observations
on
the
recent
election
for
this
borough
has
presumed
to
violate
the
hallowed
sanctity
of
private
life
and
to
refer
in
a
manner
not
to
be
misunderstood
to
the
personal
affairs
of
our
late
candidate
aye
and
notwithstanding
his
base
defeat
we
will
add
our
future
member
fizkin
what
does
our
dastardly
contemporary
mean
what
would
the
ruffian
say
if
we
setting
at
naught
like
him
the
decencies
of
social
intercourse
were
to
raise
the
curtain
which
happily
conceals
private
life
from
general
ridicule
not
to
say
from
general
execration
what
if
we
were
even
to
point
out
and
comment
on
facts
and
circumstances
which
are
publicly
notorious
and
beheld
by
every
one
but
our
contemporary
what
if
we
were
to
print
the
following
effusion
which
we
received
while
we
were
writing
the
commencement
of
this
article
from
a
talented
and
correspondent
lines
to
a
brass
pot
oh
pott
if
you
d
known
how
false
she
d
have
grown
when
you
heard
the
marriage
bells
tinkle
you
d
have
done
then
i
vow
what
you
can
not
help
now
what
said
pott
solemnly
what
rhymes
to
tinkle
villain
what
rhymes
to
tinkle
said
pott
whose
entrance
at
the
moment
forestalled
the
reply
what
rhymes
to
tinkle
why
winkle
i
should
saying
this
pott
smiled
sweetly
on
the
disturbed
pickwickian
and
extended
her
hand
towards
him
the
agitated
young
man
would
have
accepted
it
in
his
confusion
had
not
pott
indignantly
interposed
back
ma
am
back
said
the
editor
take
his
hand
before
my
very
face
mr
said
his
astonished
lady
wretched
woman
look
here
exclaimed
the
husband
look
here
ma
am
lines
to
a
brass
brass
pot
that
s
me
ma
am
false
have
grown
that
s
you
ma
am
with
this
ebullition
of
rage
which
was
not
unaccompanied
with
something
like
a
tremble
at
the
expression
of
his
wife
s
face
pott
dashed
the
current
number
of
the
eatanswill
at
her
feet
upon
my
word
sir
said
the
astonished
pott
stooping
to
pick
up
the
paper
upon
my
word
sir
pott
winced
beneath
the
contemptuous
gaze
of
his
wife
he
had
made
a
desperate
struggle
to
screw
up
his
courage
but
it
was
fast
coming
unscrewed
again
there
appears
nothing
very
tremendous
in
this
little
sentence
upon
my
word
sir
when
it
comes
to
be
read
but
the
tone
of
voice
in
which
it
was
delivered
and
the
look
that
accompanied
it
both
seeming
to
bear
reference
to
some
revenge
to
be
thereafter
visited
upon
the
head
of
pott
produced
their
effect
upon
him
the
most
unskilful
observer
could
have
detected
in
his
troubled
countenance
a
readiness
to
resign
his
wellington
boots
to
any
efficient
substitute
who
would
have
consented
to
stand
in
them
at
that
moment
pott
read
the
paragraph
uttered
a
loud
shriek
and
threw
herself
at
full
length
on
the
screaming
and
tapping
it
with
the
heels
of
her
shoes
in
a
manner
which
could
leave
no
doubt
of
the
propriety
of
her
feelings
on
the
occasion
my
dear
said
the
terrified
pott
i
didn
t
say
i
believed
it
i
but
the
unfortunate
man
s
voice
was
drowned
in
the
screaming
of
his
partner
mrs
pott
let
me
entreat
you
my
dear
ma
am
to
compose
yourself
said
winkle
but
the
shrieks
and
tappings
were
louder
and
more
frequent
than
ever
my
dear
said
pott
i
m
very
sorry
if
you
won
t
consider
your
own
health
consider
me
my
dear
we
shall
have
a
crowd
round
the
but
the
more
strenuously
pott
entreated
the
more
vehemently
the
screams
poured
forth
very
fortunately
however
attached
to
pott
s
person
was
a
bodyguard
of
one
a
young
lady
whose
ostensible
employment
was
to
preside
over
her
toilet
but
who
rendered
herself
useful
in
a
variety
of
ways
and
in
none
more
so
than
in
the
particular
department
of
constantly
aiding
and
abetting
her
mistress
in
every
wish
and
inclination
opposed
to
the
desires
of
the
unhappy
pott
the
screams
reached
this
young
lady
s
ears
in
due
course
and
brought
her
into
the
room
with
a
speed
which
threatened
to
derange
materially
the
very
exquisite
arrangement
of
her
cap
and
ringlets
oh
my
dear
dear
mistress
exclaimed
the
bodyguard
kneeling
frantically
by
the
side
of
the
prostrate
pott
oh
my
dear
mistress
what
is
the
matter
your
master
your
brutal
master
murmured
the
patient
pott
was
evidently
giving
way
it
s
a
shame
said
the
bodyguard
reproachfully
i
know
he
ll
be
the
death
on
you
ma
am
poor
dear
thing
he
gave
way
more
the
opposite
party
followed
up
the
attack
oh
don
t
leave
me
don
t
leave
me
goodwin
murmured
pott
clutching
at
the
wrist
of
the
said
goodwin
with
an
hysteric
jerk
you
re
the
only
person
that
s
kind
to
me
at
this
affecting
appeal
goodwin
got
up
a
little
domestic
tragedy
of
her
own
and
shed
tears
copiously
never
ma
am
never
said
goodwin
oh
sir
you
should
be
careful
you
should
indeed
you
don
t
know
what
harm
you
may
do
missis
you
ll
be
sorry
for
it
one
day
i
know
i
ve
always
said
the
unlucky
pott
looked
timidly
on
but
said
nothing
goodwin
said
pott
in
a
soft
voice
ma
am
said
goodwin
if
you
only
knew
how
i
have
loved
that
man
don
t
distress
yourself
by
recollecting
it
ma
am
said
the
bodyguard
pott
looked
very
frightened
it
was
time
to
finish
him
and
now
sobbed
pott
now
after
all
to
be
treated
in
this
way
to
be
reproached
and
insulted
in
the
presence
of
a
third
party
and
that
party
almost
a
stranger
but
i
will
not
submit
to
it
goodwin
continued
pott
raising
herself
in
the
arms
of
her
attendant
my
brother
the
lieutenant
shall
interfere
i
ll
be
separated
goodwin
it
would
certainly
serve
him
right
ma
am
said
goodwin
whatever
thoughts
the
threat
of
a
separation
might
have
awakened
in
pott
s
mind
he
forbore
to
give
utterance
to
them
and
contented
himself
by
saying
with
great
humility
my
dear
will
you
hear
me
a
fresh
train
of
sobs
was
the
only
reply
as
pott
grew
more
hysterical
requested
to
be
informed
why
she
was
ever
born
and
required
sundry
other
pieces
of
information
of
a
similar
description
my
dear
remonstrated
pott
do
not
give
way
to
these
sensitive
feelings
i
never
believed
that
the
paragraph
had
any
foundation
my
dear
impossible
i
was
only
angry
my
dear
i
may
say
outrageous
with
the
people
for
daring
to
insert
it
that
s
pott
cast
an
imploring
look
at
the
innocent
cause
of
the
mischief
as
if
to
entreat
him
to
say
nothing
about
the
serpent
and
what
steps
sir
do
you
mean
to
take
to
obtain
redress
inquired
winkle
gaining
courage
as
he
saw
pott
losing
it
oh
goodwin
observed
pott
does
he
mean
to
horsewhip
the
editor
of
the
does
he
goodwin
hush
hush
ma
am
pray
keep
yourself
quiet
replied
the
bodyguard
i
dare
say
he
will
if
you
wish
it
ma
certainly
said
pott
as
his
wife
evinced
decided
symptoms
of
going
off
again
of
course
i
when
goodwin
when
said
pott
still
undecided
about
the
going
off
immediately
of
course
said
pott
before
the
day
is
oh
goodwin
resumed
pott
it
s
the
only
way
of
meeting
the
slander
and
setting
me
right
with
the
certainly
ma
am
replied
goodwin
no
man
as
is
a
man
ma
am
could
refuse
to
do
so
as
the
hysterics
were
still
hovering
about
pott
said
once
more
that
he
would
do
it
but
pott
was
so
overcome
at
the
bare
idea
of
having
ever
been
suspected
that
she
was
half
a
dozen
times
on
the
very
verge
of
a
relapse
and
most
unquestionably
would
have
gone
off
had
it
not
been
for
the
indefatigable
efforts
of
the
assiduous
goodwin
and
repeated
entreaties
for
pardon
from
the
conquered
pott
and
finally
when
that
unhappy
individual
had
been
frightened
and
snubbed
down
to
his
proper
level
pott
recovered
and
they
went
to
breakfast
you
will
not
allow
this
base
newspaper
slander
to
shorten
your
stay
here
winkle
said
pott
smiling
through
the
traces
of
her
tears
i
hope
not
said
pott
actuated
as
he
spoke
by
a
wish
that
his
visitor
would
choke
himself
with
the
morsel
of
dry
toast
which
he
was
raising
to
his
lips
at
the
moment
and
so
terminate
his
stay
effectually
i
hope
you
are
very
good
said
winkle
but
a
letter
has
been
received
from
pickwick
so
i
learn
by
a
note
from
tupman
which
was
brought
up
to
my
bedroom
door
this
morning
in
which
he
requests
us
to
join
him
at
bury
and
we
are
to
leave
by
the
coach
at
but
you
will
come
back
said
pott
oh
certainly
replied
winkle
you
are
quite
sure
said
pott
stealing
a
tender
look
at
her
visitor
quite
responded
winkle
the
breakfast
passed
off
in
silence
for
each
of
the
party
was
brooding
over
his
or
her
own
personal
grievances
pott
was
regretting
the
loss
of
a
beau
pott
his
rash
pledge
to
horsewhip
the
winkle
his
having
innocently
placed
himself
in
so
awkward
a
situation
noon
approached
and
after
many
adieux
and
promises
to
return
he
tore
himself
away
if
he
ever
comes
back
i
ll
poison
him
thought
pott
as
he
turned
into
the
little
back
office
where
he
prepared
his
thunderbolts
if
i
ever
do
come
back
and
mix
myself
up
with
these
people
again
thought
winkle
as
he
wended
his
way
to
the
peacock
i
shall
deserve
to
be
horsewhipped
myself
that
s
his
friends
were
ready
the
coach
was
nearly
so
and
in
half
an
hour
they
were
proceeding
on
their
journey
along
the
road
over
which
pickwick
and
sam
had
so
recently
travelled
and
of
which
as
we
have
already
said
something
we
do
not
feel
called
upon
to
extract
snodgrass
s
poetical
and
beautiful
description
weller
was
standing
at
the
door
of
the
angel
ready
to
receive
them
and
by
that
gentleman
they
were
ushered
to
the
apartment
of
pickwick
where
to
the
no
small
surprise
of
winkle
and
snodgrass
and
the
no
small
embarrassment
of
tupman
they
found
old
wardle
and
trundle
how
are
you
said
the
old
man
grasping
tupman
s
hand
don
t
hang
back
or
look
sentimental
about
it
it
can
t
be
helped
old
fellow
for
her
sake
i
wish
you
d
had
her
for
your
own
i
m
very
glad
you
have
not
a
young
fellow
like
you
will
do
better
one
of
these
days
eh
with
this
conclusion
wardle
slapped
tupman
on
the
back
and
laughed
heartily
well
and
how
are
you
my
fine
fellows
said
the
old
gentleman
shaking
hands
with
winkle
and
snodgrass
at
the
same
time
i
have
just
been
telling
pickwick
that
we
must
have
you
all
down
at
christmas
we
re
going
to
have
a
wedding
a
real
wedding
this
a
wedding
exclaimed
snodgrass
turning
very
pale
yes
a
wedding
but
don
t
be
frightened
said
the
old
man
it
s
only
trundle
there
and
oh
is
that
all
said
snodgrass
relieved
from
a
painful
doubt
which
had
fallen
heavily
on
his
breast
give
you
joy
sir
how
is
joe
very
well
replied
the
old
gentleman
sleepy
as
and
your
mother
and
the
clergyman
and
all
of
em
quite
where
said
tupman
with
an
effort
where
is
sir
and
he
turned
away
his
head
and
covered
his
eyes
with
his
hand
said
the
old
gentleman
with
a
knowing
shake
of
the
head
do
you
mean
my
single
relative
eh
tupman
by
a
nod
intimated
that
his
question
applied
to
the
disappointed
rachael
oh
she
s
gone
away
said
the
old
gentleman
she
s
living
at
a
relation
s
far
enough
off
she
couldn
t
bear
to
see
the
girls
so
i
let
her
go
but
come
here
s
the
dinner
you
must
be
hungry
after
your
ride
i
am
without
any
ride
at
all
so
let
us
fall
ample
justice
was
done
to
the
meal
and
when
they
were
seated
round
the
table
after
it
had
been
disposed
of
pickwick
to
the
intense
horror
and
indignation
of
his
followers
related
the
adventure
he
had
undergone
and
the
success
which
had
attended
the
base
artifices
of
the
diabolical
jingle
and
the
attack
of
rheumatism
which
i
caught
in
that
garden
said
pickwick
in
conclusion
renders
me
lame
at
this
i
too
have
had
something
of
an
adventure
said
winkle
with
a
smile
and
at
the
request
of
pickwick
he
detailed
the
malicious
libel
of
the
eatanswill
and
the
consequent
excitement
of
their
friend
the
editor
pickwick
s
brow
darkened
during
the
recital
his
friends
observed
it
and
when
winkle
had
concluded
maintained
a
profound
silence
pickwick
struck
the
table
emphatically
with
his
clenched
fist
and
spoke
as
follows
is
it
not
a
wonderful
circumstance
said
pickwick
that
we
seem
destined
to
enter
no
man
s
house
without
involving
him
in
some
degree
of
trouble
does
it
not
i
ask
bespeak
the
indiscretion
or
worse
than
that
the
blackness
of
heart
that
i
should
say
so
of
my
followers
that
beneath
whatever
roof
they
locate
they
disturb
the
peace
of
mind
and
happiness
of
some
confiding
female
is
it
not
i
say
pickwick
would
in
all
probability
have
gone
on
for
some
time
had
not
the
entrance
of
sam
with
a
letter
caused
him
to
break
off
in
his
eloquent
discourse
he
passed
his
handkerchief
across
his
forehead
took
off
his
spectacles
wiped
them
and
put
them
on
again
and
his
voice
had
recovered
its
wonted
softness
of
tone
when
he
said
what
have
you
there
sam
called
at
the
just
now
and
found
this
here
letter
as
has
laid
there
for
two
days
replied
weller
it
s
sealed
vith
a
vafer
and
directed
in
round
i
don
t
know
this
hand
said
pickwick
opening
the
letter
mercy
on
us
what
s
this
it
must
be
a
jest
it
it
can
t
be
what
s
the
matter
was
the
general
inquiry
nobody
dead
is
there
said
wardle
alarmed
at
the
horror
in
pickwick
s
countenance
pickwick
made
no
reply
but
pushing
the
letter
across
the
table
and
desiring
tupman
to
read
it
aloud
fell
back
in
his
chair
with
a
look
of
vacant
astonishment
quite
alarming
to
behold
tupman
with
a
trembling
voice
read
the
letter
of
which
the
following
is
a
copy

dodson

samuel
pickwick
there
was
something
so
impressive
in
the
mute
astonishment
with
which
each
man
regarded
his
neighbour
and
every
man
regarded
pickwick
that
all
seemed
afraid
to
speak
the
silence
was
at
length
broken
by
tupman
dodson
and
fogg
he
repeated
mechanically
bardell
and
pickwick
said
snodgrass
musing
peace
of
mind
and
happiness
of
confiding
females
murmured
winkle
with
an
air
of
abstraction
it
s
a
conspiracy
said
pickwick
at
length
recovering
the
power
of
speech
a
base
conspiracy
between
these
two
grasping
attorneys
dodson
and
fogg
bardell
would
never
do
it
she
hasn
t
the
heart
to
do
it
she
hasn
t
the
case
to
do
it
ridiculous
of
her
heart
said
wardle
with
a
smile
you
should
certainly
be
the
best
judge
i
don
t
wish
to
discourage
you
but
i
should
certainly
say
that
of
her
case
dodson
and
fogg
are
far
better
judges
than
any
of
us
can
it
s
a
vile
attempt
to
extort
money
said
pickwick
i
hope
it
is
said
wardle
with
a
short
dry
cough
who
ever
heard
me
address
her
in
any
way
but
that
in
which
a
lodger
would
address
his
landlady
continued
pickwick
with
great
vehemence
who
ever
saw
me
with
her
not
even
my
friends
here
except
on
one
occasion
said
tupman
pickwick
changed
colour
ah
said
wardle
well
that
s
important
there
was
nothing
suspicious
then
i
suppose
tupman
glanced
timidly
at
his
leader
why
said
he
there
was
nothing
suspicious
but
i
don
t
know
how
it
happened
mind
she
certainly
was
reclining
in
his
gracious
powers
ejaculated
pickwick
as
the
recollection
of
the
scene
in
question
struck
forcibly
upon
him
what
a
dreadful
instance
of
the
force
of
circumstances
so
she
was
so
she
and
our
friend
was
soothing
her
anguish
said
winkle
rather
maliciously
so
i
was
said
pickwick
i
don
t
deny
it
so
i
hollo
said
wardle
for
a
case
in
which
there
s
nothing
suspicious
this
looks
rather
queer
eh
pickwick
ah
sly
dog
sly
dog
and
he
laughed
till
the
glasses
on
the
sideboard
rang
again
what
a
dreadful
conjunction
of
appearances
exclaimed
pickwick
resting
his
chin
upon
his
hands
winkle
tupman
i
beg
your
pardon
for
the
observations
i
made
just
now
we
are
all
the
victims
of
circumstances
and
i
the
with
this
apology
pickwick
buried
his
head
in
his
hands
and
ruminated
while
wardle
measured
out
a
regular
circle
of
nods
and
winks
addressed
to
the
other
members
of
the
company
i
ll
have
it
explained
though
said
pickwick
raising
his
head
and
hammering
the
table
i
ll
see
this
dodson
and
fogg
i
ll
go
to
london
not
said
wardle
you
re
too
well
then
next
next
day
is
the
first
of
september
and
you
re
pledged
to
ride
out
with
us
as
far
as
sir
geoffrey
manning
s
grounds
at
all
events
and
to
meet
us
at
lunch
if
you

t
take

well
then
the
day
after
said
pickwick
sam
sir
replied
weller

two
places
outside
to
london
on
thursday
morning
for
yourself
and
wery
well
weller
left
the
room
and
departed
slowly
on
his
errand
with
his
hands
in
his
pocket
and
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
rum
feller
the
hemperor

as
he
walked
slowly
up
the
street

done
it
though
i
didn
t
think

d

moralising
in
this
strain
samuel
weller
bent
his
steps
towards
the
chapter
xix
a
pleasant
day
with
an
unpleasant
termination
the
birds
who
happily
for
their
own
peace
of
mind
and
personal
comfort
were
in
blissful
ignorance
of
the
preparations
which
had
been
making
to
astonish
them
on
the
first
of
september
hailed
it
no
doubt
as
one
of
the
pleasantest
mornings
they
had
seen
that
season
many
a
young
partridge
who
strutted
complacently
among
the
stubble
with
all
the
finicking
coxcombry
of
youth
and
many
an
older
one
who
watched
his
levity
out
of
his
little
round
eye
with
the
contemptuous
air
of
a
bird
of
wisdom
and
experience
alike
unconscious
of
their
approaching
doom
basked
in
the
fresh
morning
air
with
lively
and
blithesome
feelings
and
a
few
hours
afterwards
were
laid
low
upon
the
earth
but
we
grow
affecting
let
us
proceed
in
plain
commonplace
then
it
was
a
fine
morning
so
fine
that
you
would
scarcely
have
believed
that
the
few
months
of
an
english
summer
had
yet
flown
by
hedges
fields
and
trees
hill
and
moorland
presented
to
the
eye
their
shades
of
deep
rich
green
scarce
a
leaf
had
fallen
scarce
a
sprinkle
of
yellow
mingled
with
the
hues
of
summer
warned
you
that
autumn
had
begun
the
sky
was
cloudless
the
sun
shone
out
bright
and
warm
the
songs
of
birds
the
hum
of
myriads
of
summer
insects
filled
the
air
and
the
cottage
gardens
crowded
with
flowers
of
every
rich
and
beautiful
tint
sparkled
in
the
heavy
dew
like
beds
of
glittering
jewels
everything
bore
the
stamp
of
summer
and
none
of
its
beautiful
colour
had
yet
faded
from
the
die
such
was
the
morning
when
an
open
carriage
in
which
were
three
pickwickians
snodgrass
having
preferred
to
remain
at
home
wardle
and
trundle
with
sam
weller
on
the
box
beside
the
driver
pulled
up
by
a
gate
at
the
roadside
before
which
stood
a
tall
boned
gamekeeper
and
a
boy
each
bearing
a
bag
of
capacious
dimensions
and
accompanied
by
a
brace
of
pointers
i
say
whispered
winkle
to
wardle
as
the
man
let
down
the
steps
they
don
t
suppose
we
re
going
to
kill
game
enough
to
fill
those
bags
do
they
fill
them
exclaimed
old
wardle
bless
you
yes
you
shall
fill
one
and
i
the
other
and
when
we
ve
done
with
them
the
pockets
of
our
will
hold
as
much
winkle
dismounted
without
saying
anything
in
reply
to
this
observation
but
he
thought
within
himself
that
if
the
party
remained
in
the
open
air
till
he
had
filled
one
of
the
bags
they
stood
a
considerable
chance
of
catching
colds
in
their
heads
hi
juno
old
girl
down
daph
down
said
wardle
caressing
the
dogs
sir
geoffrey
still
in
scotland
of
course
martin
the
tall
gamekeeper
replied
in
the
affirmative
and
looked
with
some
surprise
from
winkle
who
was
holding
his
gun
as
if
he
wished
his
coat
pocket
to
save
him
the
trouble
of
pulling
the
trigger
to
tupman
who
was
holding
his
as
if
he
was
afraid
of
it
as
there
is
no
earthly
reason
to
doubt
he
really
was
my
friends
are
not
much
in
the
way
of
this
sort
of
thing
yet
martin
said
wardle
noticing
the
look
live
and
learn
you
know
they
ll
be
good
shots
one
of
these
days
i
beg
my
friend
winkle
s
pardon
though
he
has
had
some
winkle
smiled
feebly
over
his
blue
neckerchief
in
acknowledgment
of
the
compliment
and
got
himself
so
mysteriously
entangled
with
his
gun
in
his
modest
confusion
that
if
the
piece
had
been
loaded
he
must
inevitably
have
shot
himself
dead
upon
the
spot
you
mustn
t
handle
your
piece
in
that
ere
way
when
you
come
to
have
the
charge
in
it
sir
said
the
tall
gamekeeper
gruffly
or
i
m
damned
if
you
won
t
make
cold
meat
of
some
on
winkle
thus
admonished
abruptly
altered
his
position
and
in
so
doing
contrived
to
bring
the
barrel
into
pretty
smart
contact
with
weller
s
head
hollo
said
sam
picking
up
his
hat
which
had
been
knocked
off
and
rubbing
his
temple
hollo
sir
if
you
comes
it
this
vay
you
ll
fill
one
o
them
bags
and
something
to
spare
at
one
here
the
boy
laughed
very
heartily
and
then
tried
to
look
as
if
it
was
somebody
else
whereat
winkle
frowned
majestically
where
did
you
tell
the
boy
to
meet
us
with
the
snack
martin
inquired
wardle
side
of
hill
at
twelve
o
clock
that
s
not
sir
geoffrey
s
land
is
it
no
sir
but
it
s
close
by
it
it
s
captain
boldwig
s
land
but
there
ll
be
nobody
to
interrupt
us
and
there
s
a
fine
bit
of
turf
very
well
said
old
wardle
now
the
sooner
we
re
off
the
better
will
you
join
us
at
twelve
then
pickwick
pickwick
was
particularly
desirous
to
view
the
sport
the
more
especially
as
he
was
rather
anxious
in
respect
of
winkle
s
life
and
limbs
on
so
inviting
a
morning
too
it
was
very
tantalising
to
turn
back
and
leave
his
friends
to
enjoy
themselves
it
was
therefore
with
a
very
rueful
air
that
he
replied
why
i
suppose
i
ain
t
the
gentleman
a
shot
sir
inquired
the
long
gamekeeper
no
replied
wardle
and
he
s
lame
i
should
very
much
like
to
go
said
pickwick
very
there
was
a
short
pause
of
commiseration
there
s
a
barrow
t
other
side
the
hedge
said
the
boy
if
the
gentleman
s
servant
would
wheel
along
the
paths
he
could
keep
nigh
us
and
we
could
lift
it
over
the
stiles
and
the
wery
thing
said
weller
who
was
a
party
interested
inasmuch
as
he
ardently
longed
to
see
the
sport
the
wery
thing
well
said
smallcheek
i
ll
have
it
out
in
a
but
here
a
difficulty
arose
the
long
gamekeeper
resolutely
protested
against
the
introduction
into
a
shooting
party
of
a
gentleman
in
a
barrow
as
a
gross
violation
of
all
established
rules
and
precedents
it
was
a
great
objection
but
not
an
insurmountable
one
the
gamekeeper
having
been
coaxed
and
feed
and
having
moreover
eased
his
mind
by
punching
the
head
of
the
inventive
youth
who
had
first
suggested
the
use
of
the
machine
pickwick
was
placed
in
it
and
off
the
party
set
wardle
and
the
long
gamekeeper
leading
the
way
and
pickwick
in
the
barrow
propelled
by
sam
bringing
up
the
rear
stop
sam
said
pickwick
when
they
had
got
half
across
the
first
field
what
s
the
matter
now
said
wardle
i
won
t
suffer
this
barrow
to
be
moved
another
step
said
pickwick
resolutely
unless
winkle
carries
that
gun
of
his
in
a
different
how
i
to
carry
it
said
the
wretched
winkle
carry
it
with
the
muzzle
to
the
ground
replied
pickwick
it
s
so
unsportsmanlike
reasoned
winkle
i
don
t
care
whether
it
s
unsportsmanlike
or
not
replied
pickwick
i
am
not
going
to
be
shot
in
a
for
the
sake
of
appearances
to
please
i
know
the
gentleman
ll
put
that
ere
charge
into
somebody
afore
he
s
done
growled
the
long
man
well
well
i
don
t
mind
said
poor
winkle
turning
his
uppermost
anythin
for
a
quiet
life
said
weller
and
on
they
went
again
stop
said
pickwick
after
they
had
gone
a
few
yards
farther
what
now
said
wardle
that
gun
of
tupman
s
is
not
safe
i
know
it
isn
t
said
pickwick
eh
what
not
safe
said
tupman
in
a
tone
of
great
alarm
not
as
you
are
carrying
it
said
pickwick
i
am
very
sorry
to
make
any
further
objection
but
i
can
not
consent
to
go
on
unless
you
carry
it
as
winkle
does
i
think
you
had
better
sir
said
the
long
gamekeeper
or
you
re
quite
as
likely
to
lodge
the
charge
in
yourself
as
in
anything
tupman
with
the
most
obliging
haste
placed
his
piece
in
the
position
required
and
the
party
moved
on
again
the
two
amateurs
marching
with
reversed
arms
like
a
couple
of
privates
at
a
royal
funeral
the
dogs
suddenly
came
to
a
dead
stop
and
the
party
advancing
stealthily
a
single
pace
stopped
too
what
s
the
matter
with
the
dogs
legs
whispered
winkle
how
queer
they
re
hush
can
t
you
replied
wardle
softly
don
t
you
see
they
re
making
a
point
making
a
point
said
winkle
staring
about
him
as
if
he
expected
to
discover
some
particular
beauty
in
the
landscape
which
the
sagacious
animals
were
calling
special
attention
to
making
a
point
what
are
they
pointing
at
keep
your
eyes
open
said
wardle
not
heeding
the
question
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
now
there
was
a
sharp
whirring
noise
that
made
winkle
start
back
as
if
he
had
been
shot
himself
bang
bang
went
a
couple
of
guns
the
smoke
swept
quickly
away
over
the
field
and
curled
into
the
air
where
are
they
said
winkle
in
a
state
of
the
highest
excitement
turning
round
and
round
in
all
directions
where
are
they
tell
me
when
to
fire
where
are
they
where
are
they
where
are
they
said
wardle
taking
up
a
brace
of
birds
which
the
dogs
had
deposited
at
his
feet
why
here
they
no
no
i
mean
the
others
said
the
bewildered
winkle
far
enough
off
by
this
time
replied
wardle
coolly
reloading
his
gun
we
shall
very
likely
be
up
with
another
covey
in
five
minutes
said
the
long
gamekeeper
if
the
gentleman
begins
to
fire
now
perhaps
he
ll
just
get
the
shot
out
of
the
barrel
by
the
time
they
ha
ha
ha
roared
weller
sam
said
pickwick
compassionating
his
follower
s
confusion
and
embarrassment
don
t
certainly
not
so
by
way
of
indemnification
weller
contorted
his
features
from
behind
the
for
the
exclusive
amusement
of
the
boy
with
the
leggings
who
thereupon
burst
into
a
boisterous
laugh
and
was
summarily
cuffed
by
the
long
gamekeeper
who
wanted
a
pretext
for
turning
round
to
hide
his
own
merriment
bravo
old
fellow
said
wardle
to
tupman
you
fired
that
time
at
all
oh
yes
replied
tupman
with
conscious
pride
i
let
it
well
done
you
ll
hit
something
next
time
if
you
look
sharp
very
easy
ain
t
it
yes
it
s
very
easy
said
tupman
how
it
hurts
one
s
shoulder
though
it
nearly
knocked
me
backwards
i
had
no
idea
these
small
firearms
kicked
ah
said
the
old
gentleman
smiling
you
ll
get
used
to
it
in
time
now
then
all
ready
all
right
with
the
barrow
there
all
right
sir
replied
weller
come
along
hold
hard
sir
said
sam
raising
the
barrow
aye
aye
replied
pickwick
and
on
they
went
as
briskly
as
need
be
keep
that
barrow
back
now
cried
wardle
when
it
had
been
hoisted
over
a
stile
into
another
field
and
pickwick
had
been
deposited
in
it
once
more
all
right
sir
replied
weller
pausing
now
winkle
said
the
old
gentleman
follow
me
softly
and
don
t
be
too
late
this
never
fear
said
winkle
are
they
pointing
no
no
not
now
quietly
now
on
they
crept
and
very
quietly
they
would
have
advanced
if
winkle
in
the
performance
of
some
very
intricate
evolutions
with
his
gun
had
not
accidentally
fired
at
the
most
critical
moment
over
the
boy
s
head
exactly
in
the
very
spot
where
the
tall
man
s
brain
would
have
been
had
he
been
there
instead
why
what
on
earth
did
you
do
that
for
said
old
wardle
as
the
birds
flew
unharmed
away
i
never
saw
such
a
gun
in
my
life
replied
poor
winkle
looking
at
the
lock
as
if
that
would
do
any
good
it
goes
off
of
its
own
accord
it
will
do
it
echoed
wardle
with
something
of
irritation
in
his
manner
i
wish
it
would
kill
something
of
its
own
it
ll
do
that
afore
long
sir
observed
the
tall
man
in
a
low
prophetic
voice
what
do
you
mean
by
that
observation
sir
inquired
winkle
angrily
never
mind
sir
never
mind
replied
the
long
gamekeeper
i
ve
no
family
myself
sir
and
this
here
boy
s
mother
will
get
something
handsome
from
sir
geoffrey
if
he
s
killed
on
his
land
load
again
sir
load
take
away
his
gun
cried
pickwick
from
the
barrow
at
the
long
man
s
dark
insinuations
take
away
his
gun
do
you
hear
somebody
nobody
however
volunteered
to
obey
the
command
and
winkle
after
darting
a
rebellious
glance
at
pickwick
reloaded
his
gun
and
proceeded
onwards
with
the
rest
we
are
bound
on
the
authority
of
pickwick
to
state
that
tupman
s
mode
of
proceeding
evinced
far
more
of
prudence
and
deliberation
than
that
adopted
by
winkle
still
this
by
no
means
detracts
from
the
great
authority
of
the
latter
gentleman
on
all
matters
connected
with
the
field
because
as
pickwick
beautifully
observes
it
has
somehow
or
other
happened
from
time
immemorial
that
many
of
the
best
and
ablest
philosophers
who
have
been
perfect
lights
of
science
in
matters
of
theory
have
been
wholly
unable
to
reduce
them
to
practice
tupman
s
process
like
many
of
our
most
sublime
discoveries
was
extremely
simple
with
the
quickness
and
penetration
of
a
man
of
genius
he
had
at
once
observed
that
the
two
great
points
to
be
attained
were
first
to
discharge
his
piece
without
injury
to
himself
and
secondly
to
do
so
without
danger
to
the
bystanders
obviously
the
best
thing
to
do
after
surmounting
the
difficulty
of
firing
at
all
was
to
shut
his
eyes
firmly
and
fire
into
the
air
on
one
occasion
after
performing
this
feat
tupman
on
opening
his
eyes
beheld
a
plump
partridge
in
the
act
of
falling
wounded
to
the
ground
he
was
on
the
point
of
congratulating
wardle
on
his
invariable
success
when
that
gentleman
advanced
towards
him
and
grasped
him
warmly
by
the
hand
tupman
said
the
old
gentleman
you
singled
out
that
particular
bird
no
said
tupman
you
did
said
wardle
i
saw
you
do
it
i
observed
you
pick
him
out
i
noticed
you
as
you
raised
your
piece
to
take
aim
and
i
will
say
this
that
the
best
shot
in
existence
could
not
have
done
it
more
beautifully
you
are
an
older
hand
at
this
than
i
thought
you
tupman
you
have
been
out
it
was
in
vain
for
tupman
to
protest
with
a
smile
of
that
he
never
had
the
very
smile
was
taken
as
evidence
to
the
contrary
and
from
that
time
forth
his
reputation
was
established
it
is
not
the
only
reputation
that
has
been
acquired
as
easily
nor
are
such
fortunate
circumstances
confined
to
meanwhile
winkle
flashed
and
blazed
and
smoked
away
without
producing
any
material
results
worthy
of
being
noted
down
sometimes
expending
his
charge
in
and
at
others
sending
it
skimming
along
so
near
the
surface
of
the
ground
as
to
place
the
lives
of
the
two
dogs
on
a
rather
uncertain
and
precarious
tenure
as
a
display
of
shooting
it
was
extremely
varied
and
curious
as
an
exhibition
of
firing
with
any
precise
object
it
was
upon
the
whole
perhaps
a
failure
it
is
an
established
axiom
that
every
bullet
has
its
if
it
apply
in
an
equal
degree
to
shot
those
of
winkle
were
unfortunate
foundlings
deprived
of
their
natural
rights
cast
loose
upon
the
world
and
billeted
nowhere
well
said
wardle
walking
up
to
the
side
of
the
barrow
and
wiping
the
streams
of
perspiration
from
his
jolly
red
face
smoking
day
isn
t
it
it
is
indeed
replied
pickwick
the
sun

tremendously
hot
even
to
me
i
don

how
you

said
the
old
gentleman
pretty
hot

his
master
nimbly
to
the
green

him
dexterously
out

side
of
the

proceeded
to

despatch

young
man
that

said
pickwick
with

slight
shudder
just
was

said
weller
surveying
his
arrangement
of
the
repast
with
great
satisfaction
now
gen

n
fall
on
as
the
english
said
to
the
french
when
they
fixed
it
needed
no
second
invitation
to
induce
the
party
to
yield
full
justice
to
the
meal
and
as
little
pressing
did
it
require
to
induce
weller
the
long
gamekeeper
and
the
two
boys
to
station
themselves
on
the
grass
at
a
little
distance
and
do
good
execution
upon
a
decent
proportion
of
the
viands
an
old
oak
afforded
a
pleasant
shelter
to
the
group
and
a
rich
prospect
of
arable
and
meadow
land
intersected
with
luxuriant
hedges
and
richly
ornamented
with
wood
lay
spread
out
before
them
this
is
delightful
thoroughly
delightful
said
pickwick
the
skin
of
whose
expressive
countenance
was
rapidly
peeling
off
with
exposure
to
the
sun
so
it
is
so
it
is
old
fellow
replied
wardle
come
a
glass
of
punch
with
great
pleasure
said
pickwick
the
satisfaction
of
whose
countenance
after
drinking
it
bore
testimony
to
the
sincerity
of
the
reply
good
said
pickwick
smacking
his
lips
very
good
i
ll
take
another
cool
very
cool
come
gentlemen
continued
pickwick
still
retaining
his
hold
upon
the
jar
a
toast
our
friends
at
dingley
the
toast
was
drunk
with
loud
acclamations
i
ll
tell
you
what
i
shall
do
to
get
up
my
shooting
again
said
winkle
who
was
eating
bread
and
ham
with
a
i
ll
put
a
stuffed
partridge
on
the
top
of
a
post
and
practise
at
it
beginning
at
a
short
distance
and
lengthening
it
by
degrees
i
understand
it
s
capital
i
know
a
gen
l
man
sir
said
weller
as
did
that
and
begun
at
two
yards
but
he
never
tried
it
on
agin
for
he
blowed
the
bird
right
clean
away
at
the
first
fire
and
nobody
ever
seed
a
feather
on
him
sam
said
pickwick
sir
replied
weller
have
the
goodness
to
reserve
your
anecdotes
till
they
are
called
cert
nly
here
weller
winked
the
eye
which
was
not
concealed
by
the
he
was
raising
to
his
lips
with
such
exquisite
facetiousness
that
the
two
boys
went
into
spontaneous
convulsions
and
even
the
long
man
condescended
to
smile
well
that
certainly
is
most
capital
cold
punch
said
pickwick
looking
earnestly
at
the
stone
bottle
and
the
day
is
extremely
warm
and
tupman
my
dear
friend
a
glass
of
punch
with
the
greatest
delight
replied
tupman
and
having
drank
that
glass
pickwick
took
another
just
to
see
whether
there
was
any
orange
peel
in
the
punch
because
orange
peel
always
disagreed
with
him
and
finding
that
there
was
not
pickwick
took
another
glass
to
the
health
of
their
absent
friend
and
then
felt
himself
imperatively
called
upon
to
propose
another
in
honour
of
the
unknown
this
constant
succession
of
glasses
produced
considerable
effect
upon
pickwick
his
countenance
beamed
with
the
most
sunny
smiles
laughter
played
around
his
lips
and
merriment
twinkled
in
his
eye
yielding
by
degrees
to
the
influence
of
the
exciting
liquid
rendered
more
so
by
the
heat
pickwick
expressed
a
strong
desire
to
recollect
a
song
which
he
had
heard
in
his
infancy
and
the
attempt
proving
abortive
sought
to
stimulate
his
memory
with
more
glasses
of
punch
which
appeared
to
have
quite
a
contrary
effect
for
from
forgetting
the
words
of
the
song
he
began
to
forget
how
to
articulate
any
words
at
all
and
finally
after
rising
to
his
legs
to
address
the
company
in
an
eloquent
speech
he
fell
into
the
barrow
and
fast
asleep
simultaneously
the
basket
having
been
repacked
and
it
being
found
perfectly
impossible
to
awaken
pickwick
from
his
torpor
some
discussion
took
place
whether
it
would
be
better
for
weller
to
wheel
his
master
back
again
or
to
leave
him
where
he
was
until
they
should
all
be
ready
to
return
the
latter
course
was
at
length
decided
on
and
as
the
further
expedition
was
not
to
exceed
an
hour
s
duration
and
as
weller
begged
very
hard
to
be
one
of
the
party
it
was
determined
to
leave
pickwick
asleep
in
the
barrow
and
to
call
for
him
on
their
return
so
away
they
went
leaving
pickwick
snoring
most
comfortably
in
the
shade
that
pickwick
would
have
continued
to
snore
in
the
shade
until
his
friends
came
back
or
in
default
thereof
until
the
shades
of
evening
had
fallen
on
the
landscape
there
appears
no
reasonable
cause
to
doubt
always
supposing
that
he
had
been
suffered
to
remain
there
in
peace
but
he
was
to
remain
there
in
peace
and
this
was
what
prevented
him
captain
boldwig
was
a
little
fierce
man
in
a
stiff
black
neckerchief
and
blue
surtout
who
when
he
did
condescend
to
walk
about
his
property
did
it
in
company
with
a
thick
rattan
stick
with
a
brass
ferrule
and
a
gardener
and
with
meek
faces
to
whom
the
gardeners
not
the
stick
captain
boldwig
gave
his
orders
with
all
due
grandeur
and
ferocity
for
captain
boldwig
s
wife
s
sister
had
married
a
marquis
and
the
captain
s
house
was
a
villa
and
his
land
grounds
and
it
was
all
very
high
and
mighty
and
great
pickwick
had
not
been
asleep
half
an
hour
when
little
captain
boldwig
followed
by
the
two
gardeners
came
striding
along
as
fast
as
his
size
and
importance
would
let
him
and
when
he
came
near
the
oak
tree
captain
boldwig
paused
and
drew
a
long
breath
and
looked
at
the
prospect
as
if
he
thought
the
prospect
ought
to
be
highly
gratified
at
having
him
to
take
notice
of
it
and
then
he
struck
the
ground
emphatically
with
his
stick
and
summoned
the
hunt
said
captain
boldwig
yes
sir
said
the
gardener
roll
this
place
morning
do
you
hear
hunt
yes
and
take
care
that
you
keep
this
place
in
good
order
do
you
hear
hunt
yes
and
remind
me
to
have
a
board
done
about
trespassers
and
spring
guns
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
to
keep
the
common
people
out
do
you
hear
hunt
do
you
hear
i
ll
not
forget
it
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
said
the
other
man
advancing
with
his
hand
to
his
hat
well
wilkins
what
s
the
matter
with
you
said
captain
boldwig
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
but
i
think
there
have
been
trespassers
here
ha
said
the
captain
scowling
around
him
yes
sir
they
have
been
dining
here
i
think
why
damn
their
audacity
so
they
have
said
captain
boldwig
as
the
crumbs
and
fragments
that
were
strewn
upon
the
grass
met
his
eye
they
have
actually
been
devouring
their
food
here
i
wish
i
had
the
vagabonds
here
said
the
captain
clenching
the
thick
stick
i
wish
i
had
the
vagabonds
here
said
the
captain
wrathfully
beg
your
pardon
sir
said
wilkins
but
but
what
eh
roared
the
captain
and
following
the
timid
glance
of
wilkins
his
eyes
encountered
the
and
pickwick
who
are
you
you
rascal
said
the
captain
administering
several
pokes
to
pickwick
s
body
with
the
thick
stick
what
s
your
name
cold
punch
murmured
pickwick
as
he
sank
to
sleep
again
what
demanded
captain
boldwig
no
reply
what
did
he
say
his
name
was
asked
the
captain
punch
i
think
sir
replied
wilkins
that
s
his
impudence
that
s
his
confounded
impudence
said
captain
boldwig
he
s
only
feigning
to
be
asleep
now
said
the
captain
in
a
high
passion
he
s
drunk
he
s
a
drunken
plebeian
wheel
him
away
wilkins
wheel
him
away
where
shall
i
wheel
him
to
sir
inquired
wilkins
with
great
timidity
wheel
him
to
the
devil
replied
captain
boldwig
very
well
sir
said
wilkins
stay
said
the
captain
wilkins
stopped
accordingly
wheel
him
said
the
captain
wheel
him
to
the
pound
and
let
us
see
whether
he
calls
himself
punch
when
he
comes
to
himself
he
shall
not
bully
me
he
shall
not
bully
me
wheel
him
away
pickwick
was
wheeled
in
compliance
with
this
imperious
mandate
and
the
great
captain
boldwig
swelling
with
indignation
proceeded
on
his
walk
inexpressible
was
the
astonishment
of
the
little
party
when
they
returned
to
find
that
pickwick
had
disappeared
and
taken
the
with
him
it
was
the
most
mysterious
and
unaccountable
thing
that
was
ever
heard
of
for
a
lame
man
to
have
got
upon
his
legs
without
any
previous
notice
and
walked
off
would
have
been
most
extraordinary
but
when
it
came
to
his
wheeling
a
heavy
barrow
before
him
by
way
of
amusement
it
grew
positively
miraculous
they
searched
every
nook
and
corner
round
together
and
separately
they
shouted
whistled
laughed
called
and
all
with
the
same
result
pickwick
was
not
to
be
found
after
some
hours
of
fruitless
search
they
arrived
at
the
unwelcome
conclusion
that
they
must
go
home
without
him
meanwhile
pickwick
had
been
wheeled
to
the
pound
and
safely
deposited
therein
fast
asleep
in
the
to
the
immeasurable
delight
and
satisfaction
not
only
of
all
the
boys
in
the
village
but
of
the
whole
population
who
had
gathered
round
in
expectation
of
his
waking
if
their
most
intense
gratification
had
been
awakened
by
seeing
him
wheeled
in
how
many
hundredfold
was
their
joy
increased
when
after
a
few
indistinct
cries
of
sam
he
sat
up
in
the
barrow
and
gazed
with
indescribable
astonishment
on
the
faces
before
him
a
general
shout
was
of
course
the
signal
of
his
having
woke
up
and
his
involuntary
inquiry
of
what
s
the
matter
occasioned
another
louder
than
the
first

the

cried
pickwick
where

friends

no

hurrah
then
there
came
a
turnip
then
a
potato
and
then
an
egg
with
a
few
other
little
tokens
of
the
playful
disposition
of
the
how
long
this
scene
might
have
lasted
or
how
much
pickwick
might
have
suffered
no
one
can
tell
had
not
a
carriage
which
was
driving
swiftly
by
suddenly
pulled
up
from
whence
there
descended
old
wardle
and
sam
weller
the
former
of
whom
in
far
less
time
than
it
takes
to
write
it
if
not
to
read
it
had
made
his
way
to
pickwick
s
side
and
placed
him
in
the
vehicle
just
as
the
latter
had
concluded
the
third
and
last
round
of
a
single
combat
with
the
run
to
the
justice

cried
a
dozen
voices

said
pickwick
as
soon
as
the
carriage
turned
out
of
the
town

were
trespassing

said
pickwick
i

bring
the
no
you

t
said
wardle
i
will
by
but
as
there
was
a
humorous
expression
in
wardle
s
face
pickwick
checked
himself
and
said
why
not
because
said
old
wardle
with
laughter
because
they
might
turn
on
some
of
us
and
say
we
had
taken
too
much
cold
do
what
he
would
a
smile
would
come
into
pickwick
s
face
the
smile
extended
into
a
laugh
the
laugh
into
a
roar
the
roar
became
general
so
to
keep
up
their
they
stopped
at
the
first
roadside
tavern

came
to

ordered

in
the

of
a
dingy
house
at
the

farthest
end
of

cornhill
sat
the
four
clerks
of
dodson
fogg
two
of
his
majesty

attorneys
of
the
courts
of
king

bench
and
common

the
aforesaid
clerks
catching
as
favourable
glimpses
of
heaven

light
and
heaven
s
sun
in
the
course
of
their
daily
labours
as
a
man
might
hope
to

he
placed
at
the
bottom
of
a
reasonably
deep
well
and
without
the
opportunity
of
perceiving
the
stars
in
the
which
the
latter
secluded
situation
affords
the
clerks
office
of
dodson
fogg
was
a
dark
mouldy
smelling
room
with
a
high
wainscotted
partition
to
screen
the
clerks
from
the
vulgar
gaze
a
couple
of
old
wooden
chairs
a
very
clock
an
almanac
an
a
row
of
and
a
few
shelves
on
which
were
deposited
several
ticketed
bundles
of
dirty
papers
some
old
deal
boxes
with
paper
labels
and
sundry
decayed
stone
ink
bottles
of
various
shapes
and
sizes
there
was
a
glass
door
leading
into
the
passage
which
formed
the
entrance
to
the
court
and
on
the
outer
side
of
this
glass
door
pickwick
closely
followed
by
sam
weller
presented
himself
on
the
friday
morning
succeeding
the
occurrence
of
which
a
faithful
narration
is
given
in
the
last
chapter
come
in
can
t
you
cried
a
voice
from
behind
the
partition
in
reply
to
pickwick
s
gentle
tap
at
the
door
and
pickwick
and
sam
entered
accordingly
mr
dodson
or
fogg
at
home
sir
inquired
pickwick
gently
advancing
hat
in
hand
towards
the
partition
mr
dodson
ain
t
at
home
and
fogg
s
particularly
engaged
replied
the
voice
and
at
the
same
time
the
head
to
which
the
voice
belonged
with
a
pen
behind
its
ear
looked
over
the
partition
and
at
pickwick
it
was
a
ragged
head
the
sandy
hair
of
which
scrupulously
parted
on
one
side
and
flattened
down
with
pomatum
was
twisted
into
little
circular
tails
round
a
flat
face
ornamented
with
a
pair
of
small
eyes
and
garnished
with
a
very
dirty
shirt
collar
and
a
rusty
black
stock
mr
dodson
ain
t
at
home
and
fogg
s
particularly
engaged
said
the
man
to
whom
the
head
belonged
when
will
dodson
be
back
sir
inquired
pickwick
can
t
will
it
be
long
before
fogg
is
disengaged
sir
don
t
here
the
man
proceeded
to
mend
his
pen
with
great
deliberation
while
another
clerk
who
was
mixing
a
seidlitz
powder
under
cover
of
the
lid
of
his
desk
laughed
approvingly
i
think
i
ll
wait
said
pickwick
there
was
no
reply
so
pickwick
sat
down
unbidden
and
listened
to
the
loud
ticking
of
the
clock
and
the
murmured
conversation
of
the
clerks
that
was
a
game
wasn
t
it
said
one
of
the
gentlemen
in
a
brown
coat
and
brass
buttons
inky
drabs
and
bluchers
at
the
conclusion
of
some
inaudible
relation
of
his
previous
evening
s
adventures
devilish
good
devilish
good
said
the
man
tom
cummins
was
in
the
chair
said
the
man
with
the
brown
coat
it
was
four
when
i
got
to
somers
town
and
then
i
was
so
uncommon
lushy
that
i
couldn
t
find
the
place
where
the
went
in
and
was
obliged
to
knock
up
the
old
ooman
i
say
i
wonder
what
old
fogg
ud
say
if
he
knew
it
i
should
get
the
sack
i
s
pose
eh
at
this
humorous
notion
all
the
clerks
laughed
in
concert
there
was
such
a
game
with
fogg
here
this
mornin
said
the
man
in
the
brown
coat
while
jack
was
upstairs
sorting
the
papers
and
you
two
were
gone
to
the
fogg
was
down
here
opening
the
letters
when
that
chap
as
we
issued
the
writ
against

in
what

his
name

ramsey
said
the
clerk
who
had
spoken
to
pickwick

two
pound
ten
and
the
costs
three
pound
five
and
here
it
is
sir
and
he
sighed
like
bricks
as
he
lugged
out
the
money
done
up
in
a
bit
of
old
fogg
looked
first
at
the
money
and
then
at
him
and
then
he
coughed
in
his
rum
way
so
that
i
knew
something
was
coming
you
don
t
know
there
s
a
declaration
filed
which
increases
the
costs
materially
i
suppose
said
fogg
you
don
t
say
that
sir
said
ramsey
starting
back
the
time
was
only
out
last
night
i
do
say
it
though
said
fogg
my
clerk
s
just
gone
to

it
hasn
t
jackson
gone
to
file
that
declaration
in
bullman
and
ramsey
wicks
of
course
i
said
yes
and
then
fogg
coughed
again
and
looked
at
ramsey
my
god
said
ramsey
and
here
have
i
nearly
driven
myself
mad
scraping
this
money
together
and
all
to

fogg
coolly
so

and
scrape

more
together

said
ramsey
striking
the
desk
with
his
fist
don

said
fogg
getting
into
a
passion
on
purpose

when

ramsey
tried
to
speak
but
fogg
wouldn
t
let
him
so
he
put
the
money
in
his
pocket
and
sneaked
out
the
door
was
scarcely
shut
when
old
fogg
turned
round
to
me
with
a
sweet
smile
on
his
face
and
drew
the
declaration
out
of
his
coat
pocket
here
wicks
says
fogg
take
a
cab
and
go
down
to
the
temple

quick
as

a

and
if

better
for

good
lesson
against

into
debt
won
t
he
wicks

and
he
smiled
so
as
he
went
away
that
it
was
delightful
to
see
him
he
is
a
capital
man
of
business
said
wicks
in
a
tone
of
the
deepest
admiration
capital
isn
t
he
the
other
three
cordially
subscribed
to
this
opinion
and
the
anecdote
afforded
the
most
unlimited
satisfaction
nice
men
these
here
sir
whispered
weller
to
his
master
wery
nice
notion
of
fun
they
has
pickwick
nodded
assent
and
coughed
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
young
gentlemen
behind
the
partition
who
having
now
relaxed
their
minds
by
a
little
conversation
among
themselves
condescended
to
take
some
notice
of
the
stranger
i
wonder
whether
fogg
s
disengaged
now
said
jackson
i
ll
see
said
wicks
dismounting
leisurely
from
his
stool
what
name
shall
i
tell
fogg
pickwick
replied
the
illustrious
subject
of
these
memoirs
jackson
departed
upstairs
on
his
errand
and
immediately
returned
with
a
message
that
fogg
would
see
pickwick
in
five
minutes
and
having
delivered
it
returned
again
to
his
desk
what
did
he
say
his
name
was
whispered
wicks
pickwick
replied
jackson
it
s
the
defendant
in
bardell
and
a
sudden
scraping
of
feet
mingled
with
the
sound
of
suppressed
laughter
was
heard
from
behind
the
partition
they
re
of
you
sir
whispered
weller
twigging
of
me
sam
replied
pickwick
what
do
you
mean
by
twigging
me
weller
replied
by
pointing
with
his
thumb
over
his
shoulder
and
pickwick
on
looking
up
became
sensible
of
the
pleasing
fact
that
all
the
four
clerks
with
countenances
expressive
of
the
utmost
amusement
and
with
their
heads
thrust
over
the
wooden
screen
were
minutely
inspecting
the
figure
and
general
appearance
of
the
supposed
trifler
with
female
hearts
and
disturber
of
female
happiness
on
his
looking
up
the
row
of
heads
suddenly
disappeared
and
the
sound
of
pens
travelling
at
a
furious
rate
over
paper
immediately
succeeded
a
sudden
ring
at
the
bell
which
hung
in
the
office
summoned
jackson
to
the
apartment
of
fogg
from
whence
he
came
back
to
say
that
he
fogg
was
ready
to
see
pickwick
if
he
would
step
upstairs
upstairs
pickwick
did
step
accordingly
leaving
sam
weller
below
the
room
door
of
the
back
bore
inscribed
in
legible
characters
the
imposing
words
mr
fogg
and
having
tapped
thereat
and
been
desired
to
come
in
jackson
ushered
pickwick
into
the
presence
is
dodson
in
inquired
fogg
just

replied
jackson
ask
him
to
step
yes

jackson
take
a
seat
sir
said
fogg
there
is
the
paper
sir
my
partner
will
be
here
directly
and
we
can
converse
about
this
matter
pickwick
took
a
seat
and
the
paper
but
instead
of
reading
the
latter
peeped
over
the
top
of
it
and
took
a
survey
of
the
man
of
business
who
was
an
elderly
sort
of
man
in
a
black
coat
dark
mixture
trousers
and
small
black
gaiters
a
kind
of
being
who
seemed
to
be
an
essential
part
of
the
desk
at
which
he
was
writing
and
to
have
as
much
thought
or
feeling
after
a
few
minutes
silence
dodson
a
plump
portly
man
with
a
loud
voice
appeared
and
the
conversation
commenced
this
is
pickwick
said
fogg
ah
you
are
the
defendant
sir
in
bardell
and
pickwick
said
dodson
i
am
sir
replied
pickwick
well
sir
said
dodson
and
what
do
you
propose
ah
said
fogg
thrusting
his
hands
into
his
trousers
pockets
and
throwing
himself
back
in
his
chair
what
do
you
propose
mr
pickwick
hush
fogg
said
dodson
let
me
hear
what
pickwick
has
to
i
came
gentlemen
said
pickwick
gazing
placidly
on
the
two
partners
i
came
here
gentlemen
to
express
the
surprise
with
which
i
received
your
letter
of
the
other
day
and
to
inquire
what
grounds
of
action
you
can
have
against
grounds
of
fogg
had
ejaculated
this
much
when
he
was
stopped
by
dodson
mr
fogg
said
dodson
i
am
going
to
i
beg
your
pardon
dodson
said
fogg
for
the
grounds
of
action
sir
continued
dodson
with
moral
elevation
in
his
air
you
will
consult
your
own
conscience
and
your
own
feelings
we
sir
we
are
guided
entirely
by
the
statement
of
our
client
that
statement
sir
may
be
true
or
it
may
be
false
it
may
be
credible
or
it
may
be
incredible
but
if
it
be
true
and
if
it
be
credible
i
do
not
hesitate
to
say
sir
that
our
grounds
of
action
sir
are
strong
and
not
to
be
shaken
you
may
be
an
unfortunate
man
sir
or
you
may
be
a
designing
one
but
if
i
were
called
upon
as
a
juryman
upon
my
oath
sir
to
express
an
opinion
of
your
conduct
sir
i
do
not
hesitate
to
assert
that
i
should
have
but
one
opinion
about
here
dodson
drew
himself
up
with
an
air
of
offended
virtue
and
looked
at
fogg
who
thrust
his
hands
farther
in
his
pockets
and
nodding
his
head
sagely
said
in
a
tone
of
the
fullest
concurrence
most
well
sir
said
pickwick
with
considerable
pain
depicted
in
his
countenance
you
will
permit
me
to
assure
you
that
i
am
a
most
unfortunate
man
so
far
as
this
case
is
i
hope
you
are
sir
replied
dodson
i
trust
you
may
be
sir
if
you
are
really
innocent
of
what
is
laid
to
your
charge
you
are
more
unfortunate
than
i
had
believed
any
man
could
possibly
be
what
do
you
say
fogg
i
say
precisely
what
you
say
replied
fogg
with
a
smile
of
incredulity
the
writ
sir
which
commences
the
action
continued
dodson
was
issued
regularly
fogg
where
is
the
here
it
is
said
fogg
handing
over
a
square
book
with
a
parchment
cover
here
is
the
entry
resumed
dodson
middlesex
capias
martha

samuel
pickwick
damages
dodson
fogg
for
the
plaintiff
all
regular
sir
dodson
coughed
and
looked
at
fogg
who
said
perfectly
also
and
then
they
both
looked
at
pickwick
i
am
to
understand
then
said
pickwick
that
it
really
is
your
intention
to
proceed
with
this
action
understand
sir
that
you
certainly
may
replied
dodson
with
something
as
near
a
smile
as
his
importance
would
allow
and
that
the
damages
are
actually
laid
at
fifteen
hundred
pounds
said
pickwick
to
which
understanding
you
may
add
my
assurance
that
if
we
could
have
prevailed
upon
our
client
they
would
have
been
laid
at
treble
the
amount
sir
replied
dodson
i
believe
bardell
specially
said
however
observed
fogg
glancing
at
dodson
that
she
would
not
compromise
for
a
farthing
unquestionably
replied
dodson
sternly
for
the
action
was
only
just
begun
and
it
wouldn
t
have
done
to
let
pickwick
compromise
it
then
even
if
he
had
been
so
disposed

it
as
fogg
put
himself
very
temptingly
within
the
reach
of
pickwick
s
clenched
fist
there
is
little
doubt
that
that
gentleman
would
have
complied
with
his
earnest
entreaty
but
for
the
interposition
of
sam
who
hearing
the
dispute
emerged
from
the
office
mounted
the
stairs
and
seized
his
master
by
the
arm

your
mind
by
blowing
up

come
out
into
the
court
and
blow
up
me
but
it
s
rayther
too
expensive
work
to
be
carried
on
and
without
the
slightest
ceremony
weller
hauled
his
master
down
the
stairs
and
down
the
court
and
having
safely
deposited
him
in
cornhill
fell
behind
prepared
to
follow
whithersoever
he
should
lead
pickwick
walked
on
abstractedly
crossed
opposite
the
mansion
house
and
bent
his
steps
up
cheapside
sam
began
to
wonder
where
they
were
going
when
his
master
turned
round
and
said
sam
i
will
go
immediately
to
perker
that
s
just
exactly
the
wery
place

pickwick

replied
pickwick
we
will
go
there
at
once
but
first
as
i
have
been
rather
ruffled
i
should
like
a
glass
of
warm
sam
where
can
i
have
it
sam

knowledge
of
london
was
extensive
and
peculiar
he
replied
without
the
slightest
consideration
second

on
the
right
hand
side
last
house
but
vun
on
the
same
side
the
vay
take
the
box
as
stands
in
the
first
fireplace
cos
there
ain
t
no
leg
in
the
middle
o
the
table
which
all
the
others
has
and
it
s
wery
pickwick
observed
his
valet
s
directions
implicitly
and
bidding
sam
follow
him
entered
the
tavern
he
had
pointed
out
where
the
hot
was
speedily
placed
before
him
while
weller
seated
at
a
respectful
distance
though
at
the
same
table
with
his
master
was
accommodated
with
a
pint
of
porter
the
room
was
one
of
a
very
homely
description
and
was
apparently
under
the
especial
patronage
of
for
several
gentleman
who
had
all
the
appearance
of
belonging
to
that
learned
profession
were
drinking
and
smoking
in
the
different
boxes
among
the
number
was
one
stout
elderly
man
in
particular
seated
in
an
opposite
box
who
attracted
pickwick
s
attention
the
stout
man
was
smoking
with
great
vehemence
but
between
every
puffs
he
took
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
and
looked
first
at
weller
and
then
at
pickwick
then
he
would
bury
in
a
quart
pot
as
much
of
his
countenance
as
the
dimensions
of
the
quart
pot
admitted
of
its
receiving
and
take
another
look
at
sam
and
pickwick
then
he
would
take
another
puffs
with
an
air
of
profound
meditation
and
look
at
them
again
at
last
the
stout
man
putting
up
his
legs
on
the
seat
and
leaning
his
back
against
the
wall
began
to
puff
at
his
pipe
without
leaving
off
at
all
and
to
stare
through
the
smoke
at
the
as
if
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
see
the
most
he
could
of
them
at
first
the
evolutions
of
the
stout
man
had
escaped
weller
s
observation
but
by
degrees
as
he
saw
pickwick
s
eyes
every
now
and
then
turning
towards
him
he
began
to
gaze
in
the
same
direction
at
the
same
time
shading
his
eyes
with
his
hand
as
if
he
partially
recognised
the
object
before
him
and
wished
to
make
quite
sure
of
its
identity
his
doubts
were
speedily
dispelled
however
for
the
stout
man
having
blown
a
thick
cloud
from
his
pipe
a
hoarse
voice
like
some
strange
effort
of
ventriloquism
emerged
from
beneath
the
capacious
shawls
which
muffled
his
throat
and
chest
and
slowly
uttered
these
sounds
wy
sammy
who
s
that
sam
inquired
pickwick
why
i
wouldn
t
ha
believed
it
sir
replied
weller
with
astonished
eyes

pickwick
what

weller
how

with
this
beautiful
ebullition
of
filial
affection
weller
made
room
on
the
seat
beside
him
for
the
stout
man
who
advanced
pipe
in
mouth
and
pot
in
hand
to
greet
him

refilled
his
pipe
from
a
tin
box
he
carried
in
his
pocket
and
lighting
his
fresh
pipe
from
the
ashes
of
the

a
great
rate

pause

replied
pickwick
laughing
and
while

in
a
whisper
of
the
relation
in
which
he
stood
towards
that
gentleman

ready
dupe
to
the
stratagems
of

the
most
profound
attention

old
who

pickwick
old

by
which
i
ve
no
doubt
they
meant
you
there
is
nothing
positively
vile
or
atrocious
in
the
appellation
of
old
fireworks
but
still
it
is
by
no
means
a
respectful
or
flattering
designation
the
recollection
of
all
the
wrongs
he
had
sustained
at
jingle
s
hands
had
crowded
on
pickwick
s
mind
the
moment
weller
began
to
speak
it
wanted
but
a
feather
to
turn
the
scale
and
old

weller
won

you

replied
stopping
short
perhaps
a
small
glass
of
brandy
to
drink
your
health
and
success
to
sammy
sir
wouldn
t
be
certainly
not
replied
pickwick
a
glass
of
brandy
here
the
brandy
was
brought
and
weller
after
pulling
his
hair
to
pickwick
and
nodding
to
sam
jerked
it
down
his
capacious
throat
as
if
it
had
been
a
small
thimbleful
well
done
father
said
sam
take
care
old
fellow
or
you
ll
have
a
touch
of
your
old
complaint
the
i
ve
found
a
sov
rin
cure
for
that
sammy
said
weller
setting
down
the
glass
a
sovereign
cure
for
the
gout
said
pickwick
hastily
producing
his
what
is
it
the
gout
sir
replied
weller
the
gout
is
a
complaint
as
arises
from
too
much
ease
and
comfort
if
ever
you
re
attacked
with
the
gout
sir
jist
you
marry
a
widder
as
has
got
a
good
loud
woice
with
a
decent
notion
of
usin
it
and
you
ll
never
have
the
gout
agin
it
s
a
capital
prescription
sir
i
takes
it
reg
lar
and
i
can
warrant
it
to
drive
away
any
illness
as
is
caused
by
too
much
having
imparted
this
valuable
secret
weller
drained
his
glass
once
more
produced
a
laboured
wink
sighed
deeply
and
slowly
retired
well
what
do
you
think
of
what
your
father
says
sam
inquired
pickwick
with
a
smile
think
sir
replied
weller
why
i
think
he
s
the
wictim
o
connubiality
as
blue
beard
s
domestic
chaplain
said
vith
a
tear
of
pity
ven
he
buried
there
was
no
replying
to
this
very
apposite
conclusion
and
therefore
pickwick
after
settling
the
reckoning
resumed
his
walk
to
gray
s
inn
by
the
time
he
reached
its
secluded
groves
however
eight
o
clock
had
struck
and
the
unbroken
stream
of
gentlemen
in
muddy
soiled
white
hats
and
rusty
apparel
who
were
pouring
towards
the
different
avenues
of
egress
warned
him
that
the
majority
of
the
offices
had
closed
for
that
day
after
climbing
two
pairs
of
steep
and
dirty
stairs
he
found
his
anticipations
were
realised
perker
s
outer
door
was
closed
and
the
dead
silence
which
followed
weller
s
repeated
kicks
thereat
announced
that
the
officials
had
retired
from
business
for
the
night
this
is
pleasant
sam
said
pickwick
i
shouldn
t
lose
an
hour
in
seeing
him
i
shall
not
be
able
to
get
one
wink
of
sleep
i
know
unless
i
have
the
satisfaction
of
reflecting
that
i
have
confided
this
matter
to
a
professional
here
s
an
old
ooman
comin
upstairs
sir
replied
weller
p
raps
she
knows
where
we
can
find
somebody
hollo
old
lady
vere
s
perker
s
people
mr
perker
s
people
said
a
thin
old
woman
stopping
to
recover
breath
after
the
ascent
of
the
staircase
mr
perker
s
people
s
gone
and
i
m
to
do
the
office
are
you
perker
s
servant
inquired
pickwick
i
am
perker
s
laundress
replied
the
woman
ah
said
pickwick
half
aside
to
sam
it
s
a
curious
circumstance
sam
that
they
call
the
old
women
in
these
inns
laundresses
i
wonder
what
s
that
for
cos
they
has
a
mortal
awersion
to
washing
anythin
i
suppose
sir
replied
weller
i
shouldn
t
wonder
said
pickwick
looking
at
the
old
woman
whose
appearance
as
well
as
the
condition
of
the
office
which
she
had
by
this
time
opened
indicated
a
rooted
antipathy
to
the
application
of
soap
and
water
do
you
know
where
i
can
find
perker
my
good
woman
no
i
don
t
replied
the
old
woman
gruffly
he
s
out
o
town
that
s
unfortunate
said
pickwick
where
s
his
clerk
do
you
know
yes
i
know
where
he
is
but
he
won
t
thank
me
for
telling
you
replied
the
laundress
i
have
very
particular
business
with
him
said
pickwick
won
t
it
do
in
the
morning
said
the
woman
not
so
well
replied
pickwick
well
said
the
old
woman
if
it
was
anything
very
particular
i
was
to
say
where
he
was
so
i
suppose
there
s
no
harm
in
telling
if
you
just
go
to
the
magpie
and
stump
and
ask
at
the
bar
for
lowten
they
ll
show
you
in
to
him
and
he
s
perker
s
with
this
direction
and
having
been
furthermore
informed
that
the
hostelry
in
question
was
situated
in
a
court
happy
in
the
double
advantage
of
being
in
the
vicinity
of
clare
market
and
closely
approximating
to
the
back
of
new
inn
pickwick
and
sam
descended
the
rickety
staircase
in
safety
and
issued
forth
in
quest
of
the
magpie
and
stump
this
favoured
tavern
sacred
to
the
evening
orgies
of
lowten
and
his
companions
was
what
ordinary
people
would
designate
a
that
the
landlord
was
a
man
of
turn
was
sufficiently
testified
by
the
fact
of
a
small
bulkhead
beneath
the
window
in
size
and
shape
not
unlike
a
being
underlet
to
a
mender
of
shoes
and
that
he
was
a
being
of
a
philanthropic
mind
was
evident
from
the
protection
he
afforded
to
a
pieman
who
vended
his
delicacies
without
fear
of
interruption
on
the
very
in
the
lower
windows
which
were
decorated
with
curtains
of
a
saffron
hue
dangled
two
or
three
printed
cards
bearing
reference
to
devonshire
cider
and
dantzic
spruce
while
a
large
blackboard
announcing
in
white
letters
to
an
enlightened
public
that
there
were
barrels
of
double
stout
in
the
cellars
of
the
establishment
left
the
mind
in
a
state
of
not
unpleasing
doubt
and
uncertainty
as
to
the
precise
direction
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth
in
which
this
mighty
cavern
might
be
supposed
to
extend
when
we
add
that
the
signboard
bore
the
obliterated
semblance
of
a
magpie
intently
eyeing
a
crooked
streak
of
brown
paint
which
the
neighbours
had
been
taught
from
infancy
to
consider
as
the
stump
we
have
said
all
that
need
be
said
of
the
exterior
of
the
edifice
on
pickwick
s
presenting
himself
at
the
bar
an
elderly
female
emerged
from
behind
the
screen
therein
and
presented
herself
before
him
is
lowten
here
ma
am
inquired
pickwick
yes
he
is
sir
replied
the
landlady
here
charley
show
the
gentleman
in
to
the
gen
l
m
n
can
t
go
in
just
now
said
a
shambling
with
a
red
head
cos
lowten
s
a
comic
song
and
he
ll
put
him
out
he
ll
be
done
directly
the
had
scarcely
finished
speaking
when
a
most
unanimous
hammering
of
tables
and
jingling
of
glasses
announced
that
the
song
had
that
instant
terminated
and
pickwick
after
desiring
sam
to
solace
himself
in
the
tap
suffered
himself
to
be
conducted
into
the
presence
of
lowten
at
the
announcement
of
a
gentleman
to
speak
to
you
sir
a
young
man
who
filled
the
chair
at
the
head
of
the
table
looked
with
some
surprise
in
the
direction
from
whence
the
voice
proceeded
and
the
surprise
seemed
to
be
by
no
means
diminished
when
his
eyes
rested
on
an
individual
whom
he
had
never
seen
before
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
said
pickwick
and
i
am
very
sorry
to
disturb
the
other
gentlemen
too
but
i
come
on
very
particular
business
and
if
you
will
suffer
me
to
detain
you
at
this
end
of
the
room
for
five
minutes
i
shall
be
very
much
obliged
to
the
young
man
rose
and
drawing
a
chair
close
to
pickwick
in
an
obscure
corner
of
the
room
listened
attentively
to
his
tale
of
woe
ah
he
said
when
pickwick
had
concluded
dodson
and
fogg
sharp
practice
theirs
capital
men
of
business
dodson
and
fogg
pickwick
admitted
the
sharp
practice
of
dodson
and
fogg
and
lowten
resumed
perker
ain
t
in
town
and
he
won
t
be
neither
before
the
end
of
next
week
but
if
you
want
the
action
defended
and
will
leave
the
copy
with
me
i
can
do
all
that
s
needful
till
he
comes
that
s
exactly
what
i
came
here
for
said
pickwick
handing
over
the
document
if
anything
particular
occurs
you
can
write
to
me
at
the
that
s
all
right
replied
perker
s
clerk
and
then
seeing
pickwick
s
eye
wandering
curiously
towards
the
table
he
added
will
you
join
us
for
half
an
hour
or
so
we
are
capital
company
here
night
there
s
samkin
and
green
s
and
smithers
and
price
s
chancery
and
pimkin
and
thomas
s
out
o
doors
sings
a
capital
song
he
does
and
jack
bamber
and
ever
so
many
more
you
re
come
out
of
the
country
i
suppose
would
you
like
to
join
us
pickwick
could
not
resist
so
tempting
an
opportunity
of
studying
human
nature
he
suffered
himself
to
be
led
to
the
table
where
after
having
been
introduced
to
the
company
in
due
form
he
was
accommodated
with
a
seat
near
the
chairman
and
called
for
a
glass
of
his
favourite
beverage
a
profound
silence
quite
contrary
to
pickwick
s
expectation
succeeded
you
don
t
find
this
sort
of
thing
disagreeable
i
hope
sir
said
his
right
hand
neighbour
a
gentleman
in
a
checked
shirt
and
mosaic
studs
with
a
cigar
in
his
mouth
not
in
the
least
replied
pickwick
i
like
it
very
much
although
i
am
no
smoker
i
should
be
very
sorry
to
say
i
wasn
t
interposed
another
gentleman
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
it
s
board
and
lodgings
to
me
is
pickwick
glanced
at
the
speaker
and
thought
that
if
it
were
washing
too
it
would
be
all
the
better
here
there
was
another
pause
pickwick
was
a
stranger
and
his
coming
had
evidently
cast
a
damp
upon
the
party
mr
grundy
s
going
to
oblige
the
company
with
a
song
said
the
chairman
no
he
ain
t
said
grundy
why
not
said
the
chairman
because
he
can
t
said
grundy
you
had
better
say
he
won
t
replied
the
chairman
well
then
he
won
t
retorted
grundy
grundy
s
positive
refusal
to
gratify
the
company
occasioned
another
silence
won
t
anybody
enliven
us
said
the
chairman
despondingly
why
don
t
you
enliven
us
yourself
chairman
said
a
young
man
with
a
whisker
a
squint
and
an
open
shirt
collar
dirty
from
the
bottom
of
the
table
hear
hear
said
the
smoking
gentleman
in
the
mosaic
jewellery
because
i
only
know
one
song
and
i
have
sung
it
already
and
it
s
a
fine
of
glasses
round
to
sing
the
same
song
twice
in
a
night
replied
the
chairman
this
was
an
unanswerable
reply
and
silence
prevailed
again
i
have
been
gentlemen
said
pickwick
hoping
to
start
a
subject
which
all
the
company
could
take
a
part
in
discussing
i
have
been
in
a
place
which
you
all
know
very
well
doubtless
but
which
i
have
not
been
in
for
some
years
and
know
very
little
of
i
mean
gray
s
inn
gentlemen
curious
little
nooks
in
a
great
place
like
london
these
old
inns
by
jove
said
the
chairman
whispering
across
the
table
to
pickwick
you
have
hit
upon
something
that
one
of
us
at
least
would
talk
upon
for
ever
you
ll
draw
old
jack
bamber
out
he
was
never
heard
to
talk
about
anything
else
but
the
inns
and
he
has
lived
alone
in
them
till
he
s
half
the
individual
to
whom
lowten
alluded
was
a
little
yellow
shouldered
man
whose
countenance
from
his
habit
of
stooping
forward
when
silent
pickwick
had
not
observed
before
he
wondered
though
when
the
old
man
raised
his
shrivelled
face
and
bent
his
gray
eye
upon
him
with
a
keen
inquiring
look
that
such
remarkable
features
could
have
escaped
his
attention
for
a
moment
there
was
a
fixed
grim
smile
perpetually
on
his
countenance
he
leaned
his
chin
on
a
long
skinny
hand
with
nails
of
extraordinary
length
and
as
he
inclined
his
head
to
one
side
and
looked
keenly
out
from
beneath
his
ragged
gray
eyebrows
there
was
a
strange
wild
slyness
in
his
leer
quite
repulsive
to
behold
this
was
the
figure
that
now
started
forward
and
burst
into
an
animated
torrent
of
words
as
this
chapter
has
been
a
long
one
however
and
as
the
old
man
was
a
remarkable
personage
it
will
be
more
respectful
to
him
and
more
convenient
to
us
to
let
him
speak
for
himself
in
a
fresh
one
chapter
xxi
in
which
the
old
man
launches
forth
into
his
favourite
theme
and
relates
a
story
about
a
queer
client
aha
said
the
old
man
a
brief
description
of
whose
manner
and
appearance
concluded
the
last
chapter
aha
who
was
talking
about
the
inns
i
was
sir
replied
pickwick
i
was
observing
what
singular
old
places
they
said
the
old
man
contemptuously
what
do
of
the
time
when
young
men
shut
themselves
up
in
those
lonely
rooms
and
read
and
read
hour
after
hour
and
night
after
night
till
their
reason
wandered
beneath
their
midnight
studies
till
their
mental
powers
were
exhausted
till
morning
s
light
brought
no
freshness
or
health
to
them
and
they
sank
beneath
the
unnatural
devotion
of
their
youthful
energies
to
their
dry
old
books
coming
down
to
a
later
time
and
a
very
different
day
what
do
know
of
the
gradual
sinking
beneath
consumption
or
the
quick
wasting
of
fever
the
grand
results
of
life
and
dissipation
which
men
have
undergone
in
these
same
rooms
how
many
vain
pleaders
for
mercy
do
you
think
have
turned
away
from
the
lawyer
s
office
to
find
a
in
the
thames
or
a
refuge
in
the
jail
they
are
no
ordinary
houses
those
there
is
not
a
panel
in
the
old
wainscotting
but
what
if
it
were
endowed
with
the
powers
of
speech
and
memory
could
start
from
the
wall
and
tell
its
tale
of
horror
the
romance
of
life
sir
the
romance
of
life
as
they
may
seem
now
i
tell
you
they
are
strange
old
places
and
i
would
rather
hear
many
a
legend
with
a
name
than
the
true
history
of
one
old
set
of
there
was
something
so
odd
in
the
old
man
s
sudden
energy
and
the
subject
which
had
called
it
forth
that
pickwick
was
prepared
with
no
observation
in
reply
and
the
old
man
checking
his
impetuosity
and
resuming
the
leer
which
had
disappeared
during
his
previous
excitement
said
look
at
them
in
another
light
their
most
and
least
romantic
what
fine
places
of
slow
torture
they
are
think
of
the
needy
man
who
has
spent
his
all
beggared
himself
and
pinched
his
friends
to
enter
the
profession
which
is
destined
never
to
yield
him
a
morsel
of
bread
the
waiting
the
hope
the
disappointment
the
fear
the
misery
the
poverty
the
blight
on
his
hopes
and
end
to
his
career
the
suicide
perhaps
or
the
shabby
slipshod
drunkard
am
i
not
right
about
them
and
the
old
man
rubbed
his
hands
and
leered
as
if
in
delight
at
having
found
another
point
of
view
in
which
to
place
his
favourite
subject
pickwick
eyed
the
old
man
with
great
curiosity
and
the
remainder
of
the
company
smiled
and
looked
on
in
silence
talk
of
your
german
universities
said
the
little
old
man
pooh
pooh
there
s
romance
enough
at
home
without
going
half
a
mile
for
it
only
people
never
think
of
i
never
thought
of
the
romance
of
this
particular
subject
before
certainly
said
pickwick
laughing
to
be
sure
you
didn
t
said
the
little
old
man
of
course
not
as
a
friend
of
mine
used
to
say
to
me
what
is
there
in
chambers
in
particular
queer
old
places
said
i
not
at
all
said
he
lonely
said
i
not
a
bit
of
it
said
he
he
died
one
morning
of
apoplexy
as
he
was
going
to
open
his
outer
door
fell
with
his
head
in
his
own
and
there
he
lay
for
eighteen
months
everybody
thought
he
d
gone
out
of
and
how
was
he
found
out
at
last
inquired
pickwick
the
benchers
determined
to
have
his
door
broken
open
as
he
hadn
t
paid
any
rent
for
two
years
so
they
did
forced
the
lock
and
a
very
dusty
skeleton
in
a
blue
coat
black
and
silks
fell
forward
in
the
arms
of
the
porter
who
opened
the
door
queer
that
rather
perhaps
rather
eh
the
little
old
man
put
his
head
more
on
one
side
and
rubbed
his
hands
with
unspeakable
glee
i
know
another
case
said
the
little
old
man
when
his
chuckles
had
in
some
degree
subsided
it
occurred
in
clifford
s
inn
tenant
of
a
top
set
bad
character
shut
himself
up
in
his
bedroom
closet
and
took
a
dose
of
arsenic
the
steward
thought
he
had
run
away
opened
the
door
and
put
a
bill
up
another
man
came
took
the
chambers
furnished
them
and
went
to
live
there
somehow
or
other
he
couldn
t
sleep
always
restless
and
uncomfortable
odd
says
he
i
ll
make
the
other
room
my
bedchamber
and
this
my
he
made
the
change
and
slept
very
well
at
night
but
suddenly
found
that
somehow
he
couldn
t
read
in
the
evening
he
got
nervous
and
uncomfortable
and
used
to
be
always
snuffing
his
candles
and
staring
about
him
i
can
t
make
this
out
said
he
when
he
came
home
from
the
play
one
night
and
was
drinking
a
glass
of
cold
grog
with
his
back
to
the
wall
in
order
that
he
mightn
t
be
able
to
fancy
there
was
any
one
behind
him
i
can
t
make
it
out
said
he
and
just
then
his
eyes
rested
on
the
little
closet
that
had
been
always
locked
up
and
a
shudder
ran
through
his
whole
frame
from
top
to
toe
i
have
felt
this
strange
feeling
before
said
he
i
can
not
help
thinking
there
s
something
wrong
about
that
he
made
a
strong
effort
plucked
up
his
courage
shivered
the
lock
with
a
blow
or
two
of
the
poker
opened
the
door
and
there
sure
enough
standing
bolt
upright
in
the
corner
was
the
last
tenant
with
a
little
bottle
clasped
firmly
in
his
hand
and
his
face
well
as
the
little
old
man
concluded
he
looked
round
on
the
attentive
faces
of
his
wondering
auditory
with
a
smile
of
grim
delight
what
strange
things
these
are
you
tell
us
of
sir
said
pickwick
minutely
scanning
the
old
man
s
countenance
by
the
aid
of
his
glasses
strange
said
the
little
old
man
nonsense
you
think
them
strange
because
you
know
nothing
about
it
they
are
funny
but
not
funny
exclaimed
pickwick
involuntarily
yes
funny
are
they
not
replied
the
little
old
man
with
a
diabolical
leer
and
then
without
pausing
for
an
answer
he
continued
i
knew
another
man
let
me
see
forty
years
ago
now
who
took
an
old
damp
rotten
set
of
chambers
in
one
of
the
most
ancient
inns
that
had
been
shut
up
and
empty
for
years
and
years
before
there
were
lots
of
old
women
s
stories
about
the
place
and
it
certainly
was
very
far
from
being
a
cheerful
one
but
he
was
poor
and
the
rooms
were
cheap
and
that
would
have
been
quite
a
sufficient
reason
for
him
if
they
had
been
ten
times
worse
than
they
really
were
he
was
obliged
to
take
some
mouldering
fixtures
that
were
on
the
place
and
among
the
rest
was
a
great
lumbering
wooden
press
for
papers
with
large
glass
doors
and
a
green
curtain
inside
a
pretty
useless
thing
for
him
for
he
had
no
papers
to
put
in
it
and
as
to
his
clothes
he
carried
them
about
with
him
and
that
wasn
t
very
hard
work
either
well
he
had
moved
in
all
his
furniture
it
wasn
t
quite
a
and
had
sprinkled
it
about
the
room
so
as
to
make
the
four
chairs
look
as
much
like
a
dozen
as
possible
and
was
sitting
down
before
the
fire
at
night
drinking
the
first
glass
of
two
gallons
of
whisky
he
had
ordered
on
credit
wondering
whether
it
would
ever
be
paid
for
and
if
so
in
how
many
years
time
when
his
eyes
encountered
the
glass
doors
of
the
wooden
press
ah
says
he
if
i
hadn
t
been
obliged
to
take
that
ugly
article
at
the
old
broker
s
valuation
i
might
have
got
something
comfortable
for
the
money
i
ll
tell
you
what
it
is
old
fellow
he
said
speaking
aloud
to
the
press
having
nothing
else
to
speak
to
if
it
wouldn
t
cost
more
to
break
up
your
old
carcass
than
it
would
ever
be
worth
afterward
i
d
have
a
fire
out
of
you
in
less
than
no
he
had
hardly
spoken
the
words
when
a
sound
resembling
a
faint
groan
appeared
to
issue
from
the
interior
of
the
case
it
startled
him
at
first
but
thinking
on
a
moment
s
reflection
that
it
must
be
some
young
fellow
in
the
next
chamber
who
had
been
dining
out
he
put
his
feet
on
the
fender
and
raised
the
poker
to
stir
the
fire
at
that
moment
the
sound
was
repeated
and
one
of
the
glass
doors
slowly
opening
disclosed
a
pale
and
emaciated
figure
in
soiled
and
worn
apparel
standing
erect
in
the
press
the
figure
was
tall
and
thin
and
the
countenance
expressive
of
care
and
anxiety
but
there
was
something
in
the
hue
of
the
skin
and
gaunt
and
unearthly
appearance
of
the
whole
form
which
no
being
of
this
world
was
ever
seen
to
wear
who
are
you
said
the
new
tenant
turning
very
pale
poising
the
poker
in
his
hand
however
and
taking
a
very
decent
aim
at
the
countenance
of
the
figure
who
are
you
don
t
throw
that
poker
at
me
replied
the
form
if
you
hurled
it
with
ever
so
sure
an
aim
it
would
pass
through
me
without
resistance
and
expend
its
force
on
the
wood
behind
i
am
a
and
pray
what
do
you
want
here
faltered
the
tenant
in
this
room
replied
the
apparition
my
worldly
ruin
was
worked
and
i
and
my
children
beggared
in
this
press
the
papers
in
a
long
long
suit
which
accumulated
for
years
were
deposited
in
this
room
when
i
had
died
of
grief
and
hope
two
wily
harpies
divided
the
wealth
for
which
i
had
contested
during
a
wretched
existence
and
of
which
at
last
not
one
farthing
was
left
for
my
unhappy
descendants
i
terrified
them
from
the
spot
and
since
that
day
have
prowled
by
night
the
only
period
at
which
i
can
revisit
the
earth
about
the
scenes
of
my
misery
this
apartment
is
mine
leave
it
to
if
you
insist
upon
making
your
appearance
here
said
the
tenant
who
had
had
time
to
collect
his
presence
of
mind
during
this
prosy
statement
of
the
ghost
s
i
shall
give
up
possession
with
the
greatest
pleasure
but
i
should
like
to
ask
you
one
question
if
you
will
allow
say
on
said
the
apparition
sternly
well
said
the
tenant
i
don
t
apply
the
observation
personally
to
you
because
it
is
equally
applicable
to
most
of
the
ghosts
i
ever
heard
of
but
it
does
appear
to
me
somewhat
inconsistent
that
when
you
have
an
opportunity
of
visiting
the
fairest
spots
of
earth
for
i
suppose
space
is
nothing
to
you
you
should
always
return
exactly
to
the
very
places
where
you
have
been
most
egad
that
s
very
true
i
never
thought
of
that
before
said
the
ghost
you
see
sir
pursued
the
tenant
this
is
a
very
uncomfortable
room
from
the
appearance
of
that
press
i
should
be
disposed
to
say
that
it
is
not
wholly
free
from
bugs
and
i
really
think
you
might
find
much
more
comfortable
quarters
to
say
nothing
of
the
climate
of
london
which
is
extremely
you
are
very
right
sir
said
the
ghost
politely
it
never
struck
me
till
now
i
ll
try
change
of
air
directly
and
in
fact
he
began
to
vanish
as
he
spoke
his
legs
indeed
had
quite
disappeared
and
if
sir
said
the
tenant
calling
after
him
if
you
the
goodness
to
suggest
to
the
other
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
are
now
engaged
in
haunting
old
empty
houses
that
they
might
be
much
more
comfortable
elsewhere
you
will
confer
a
very
great
benefit
on
i
will
replied
the
ghost
we
must
be
dull
fellows
very
dull
fellows
indeed
i
can
t
imagine
how
we
can
have
been
so
with
these
words
the
spirit
disappeared
and
what
is
rather
remarkable
added
the
old
man
with
a
shrewd
look
round
the
table
he
never
came
back
that
ain
t
bad
if
it
s
true
said
the
man
in
the
mosaic
studs
lighting
a
fresh
cigar
exclaimed
the
old
man
with
a
look
of
excessive
contempt
i
suppose
he
added
turning
to
lowten
he
ll
say
next
that
my
story
about
the
queer
client
we
had
when
i
was
in
an
attorney
s
office
is
not
true
either
i
shouldn
t
i
shan
t
venture
to
say
anything
at
all
about
it
seeing
that
i
never
heard
the
story
observed
the
owner
of
the
mosaic
decorations
i
wish
you
would
repeat
it
sir
said
pickwick
ah
do
said
lowten
nobody
has
heard
it
but
me
and
i
have
nearly
forgotten
the
old
man
looked
round
the
table
and
leered
more
horribly
than
ever
as
if
in
triumph
at
the
attention
which
was
depicted
in
every
face
then
rubbing
his
chin
with
his
hand
and
looking
up
to
the
ceiling
as
if
to
recall
the
circumstances
to
his
memory
he
began
as
follows
the
old
man
s
tale
about
the
queer
client
it
matters
little
said
the
old
man
where
or
how
i
picked
up
this
brief
history
if
i
were
to
relate
it
in
the
order
in
which
it
reached
me
i
should
commence
in
the
middle
and
when
i
had
arrived
at
the
conclusion
go
back
for
a
beginning
it
is
enough
for
me
to
say
that
some
of
its
circumstances
passed
before
my
own
eyes
for
the
remainder
i
know
them
to
have
happened
and
there
are
some
persons
yet
living
who
will
remember
them
but
too
well
in
the
borough
high
street
near
george
s
church
and
on
the
same
side
of
the
way
stands
as
most
people
know
the
smallest
of
our
debtors
prisons
the
marshalsea
although
in
later
times
it
has
been
a
very
different
place
from
the
sink
of
filth
and
dirt
it
once
was
even
its
improved
condition
holds
out
but
little
temptation
to
the
extravagant
or
consolation
to
the
improvident
the
condemned
felon
has
as
good
a
yard
for
air
and
exercise
in
newgate
as
the
insolvent
debtor
in
the
marshalsea
prison
better
but
this
is
past
in
a
better
age
and
the
prison
exists
no
longer
it
may
be
my
fancy
or
it
may
be
that
i
can
not
separate
the
place
from
the
old
recollections
associated
with
it
but
this
part
of
london
i
can
not
bear
the
street
is
broad
the
shops
are
spacious
the
noise
of
passing
vehicles
the
footsteps
of
a
perpetual
stream
of
people
all
the
busy
sounds
of
traffic
resound
in
it
from
morn
to
midnight
but
the
streets
around
are
mean
and
close
poverty
and
debauchery
lie
festering
in
the
crowded
alleys
want
and
misfortune
are
pent
up
in
the
narrow
prison
an
air
of
gloom
and
dreariness
seems
in
my
eyes
at
least
to
hang
about
the
scene
and
to
impart
to
it
a
squalid
and
sickly
hue
many
eyes
that
have
long
since
been
closed
in
the
grave
have
looked
round
upon
that
scene
lightly
enough
when
entering
the
gate
of
the
old
marshalsea
prison
for
the
first
time
for
despair
seldom
comes
with
the
first
severe
shock
of
misfortune
a
man
has
confidence
in
untried
friends
he
remembers
the
many
offers
of
service
so
freely
made
by
his
boon
companions
when
he
wanted
them
not
he
has
hope
the
hope
of
happy
inexperience
and
however
he
may
bend
beneath
the
first
shock
it
springs
up
in
his
bosom
and
flourishes
there
for
a
brief
space
until
it
droops
beneath
the
blight
of
disappointment
and
neglect
how
soon
have
those
same
eyes
deeply
sunken
in
the
head
glared
from
faces
wasted
with
famine
and
sallow
from
confinement
in
days
when
it
was
no
figure
of
speech
to
say
that
debtors
rotted
in
prison
with
no
hope
of
release
and
no
prospect
of
liberty
the
atrocity
in
its
full
extent
no
longer
exists
but
there
is
enough
of
it
left
to
give
rise
to
occurrences
that
make
the
heart
bleed
twenty
years
ago
that
pavement
was
worn
with
the
footsteps
of
a
mother
and
child
who
day
by
day
so
surely
as
the
morning
came
presented
themselves
at
the
prison
gate
often
after
a
night
of
restless
misery
and
anxious
thoughts
were
they
there
a
full
hour
too
soon
and
then
the
young
mother
turning
meekly
away
would
lead
the
child
to
the
old
bridge
and
raising
him
in
her
arms
to
show
him
the
glistening
water
tinted
with
the
light
of
the
morning
s
sun
and
stirring
with
all
the
bustling
preparations
for
business
and
pleasure
that
the
river
presented
at
that
early
hour
endeavour
to
interest
his
thoughts
in
the
objects
before
him
but
she
would
quickly
set
him
down
and
hiding
her
face
in
her
shawl
give
vent
to
the
tears
that
blinded
her
for
no
expression
of
interest
or
amusement
lighted
up
his
thin
and
sickly
face
his
recollections
were
few
enough
but
they
were
all
of
one
kind
all
connected
with
the
poverty
and
misery
of
his
parents
hour
after
hour
had
he
sat
on
his
mother
s
knee
and
with
childish
sympathy
watched
the
tears
that
stole
down
her
face
and
then
crept
quietly
away
into
some
dark
corner
and
sobbed
himself
to
sleep
the
hard
realities
of
the
world
with
many
of
its
worst
privations
hunger
and
thirst
and
cold
and
want
had
all
come
home
to
him
from
the
first
dawnings
of
reason
and
though
the
form
of
childhood
was
there
its
light
heart
its
merry
laugh
and
sparkling
eyes
were
wanting
the
father
and
mother
looked
on
upon
this
and
upon
each
other
with
thoughts
of
agony
they
dared
not
breathe
in
words
the
healthy
made
man
who
could
have
borne
almost
any
fatigue
of
active
exertion
was
wasting
beneath
the
close
confinement
and
unhealthy
atmosphere
of
a
crowded
prison
the
slight
and
delicate
woman
was
sinking
beneath
the
combined
effects
of
bodily
and
mental
illness
the
child
s
young
heart
was
breaking
winter
came
and
with
it
weeks
of
cold
and
heavy
rain
the
poor
girl
had
removed
to
a
wretched
apartment
close
to
the
spot
of
her
husband
s
imprisonment
and
though
the
change
had
been
rendered
necessary
by
their
increasing
poverty
she
was
happier
now
for
she
was
nearer
him
for
two
months
she
and
her
little
companion
watched
the
opening
of
the
gate
as
usual
one
day
she
failed
to
come
for
the
first
time
another
morning
arrived
and
she
came
alone
the
child
was
dead
they
little
know
who
coldly
talk
of
the
poor
man
s
bereavements
as
a
happy
release
from
pain
to
the
departed
and
a
merciful
relief
from
expense
to
the
survivor
they
little
know
i
say
what
the
agony
of
those
bereavements
is
a
silent
look
of
affection
and
regard
when
all
other
eyes
are
turned
coldly
away
the
consciousness
that
we
possess
the
sympathy
and
affection
of
one
being
when
all
others
have
deserted
us
is
a
hold
a
stay
a
comfort
in
the
deepest
affliction
which
no
wealth
could
purchase
or
power
bestow
the
child
had
sat
at
his
parents
feet
for
hours
together
with
his
little
hands
patiently
folded
in
each
other
and
his
thin
wan
face
raised
towards
them
they
had
seen
him
pine
away
from
day
to
day
and
though
his
brief
existence
had
been
a
joyless
one
and
he
was
now
removed
to
that
peace
and
rest
which
child
as
he
was
he
had
never
known
in
this
world
they
were
his
parents
and
his
loss
sank
deep
into
their
souls
it
was
plain
to
those
who
looked
upon
the
mother
s
altered
face
that
death
must
soon
close
the
scene
of
her
adversity
and
trial
her
husband
s
shrank
from
obtruding
on
his
grief
and
misery
and
left
to
himself
alone
the
small
room
he
had
previously
occupied
in
common
with
two
companions
she
shared
it
with
him
and
lingering
on
without
pain
but
without
hope
her
life
ebbed
slowly
away
she
had
fainted
one
evening
in
her
husband
s
arms
and
he
had
borne
her
to
the
open
window
to
revive
her
with
the
air
when
the
light
of
the
moon
falling
full
upon
her
face
showed
him
a
change
upon
her
features
which
made
him
stagger
beneath
her
weight
like
a
helpless
infant
set
me
down
george
she
said
faintly
he
did
so
and
seating
himself
beside
her
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
and
burst
into
tears
it
is
very
hard
to
leave
you
george
she
said
but
it
is
god
s
will
and
you
must
bear
it
for
my
sake
oh
how
i
thank
him
for
having
taken
our
boy
he
is
happy
and
in
heaven
now
what
would
he
have
done
here
without
his
mother
you
shall
not
die
mary
you
shall
not
die
said
the
husband
starting
up
he
paced
hurriedly
to
and
fro
striking
his
head
with
his
clenched
fists
then
reseating
himself
beside
her
and
supporting
her
in
his
arms
added
more
calmly
rouse
yourself
my
dear
girl
pray
pray
do
you
will
revive
never
again
george
never
again
said
the
dying
woman
let
them
lay
me
by
my
poor
boy
now
but
promise
me
that
if
ever
you
leave
this
dreadful
place
and
should
grow
rich
you
will
have
us
removed
to
some
quiet
country
churchyard
a
long
long
way
off
very
far
from
here
where
we
can
rest
in
peace
dear
george
promise
me
you
i
do
i
do
said
the
man
throwing
himself
passionately
on
his
knees
before
her
speak
to
me
mary
another
word
one
look
but
one
he
ceased
to
speak
for
the
arm
that
clasped
his
neck
grew
stiff
and
heavy
a
deep
sigh
escaped
from
the
wasted
form
before
him
the
lips
moved
and
a
smile
played
upon
the
face
but
the
lips
were
pallid
and
the
smile
faded
into
a
rigid
and
ghastly
stare
he
was
alone
in
the
world
that
night
in
the
silence
and
desolation
of
his
miserable
room
the
wretched
man
knelt
down
by
the
dead
body
of
his
wife
and
called
on
god
to
witness
a
terrible
oath
that
from
that
hour
he
devoted
himself
to
revenge
her
death
and
that
of
his
child
that
thenceforth
to
the
last
moment
of
his
life
his
whole
energies
should
be
directed
to
this
one
object
that
his
revenge
should
be
protracted
and
terrible
that
his
hatred
should
be
undying
and
inextinguishable
and
should
hunt
its
object
through
the
world
the
deepest
despair
and
passion
scarcely
human
had
made
such
fierce
ravages
on
his
face
and
form
in
that
one
night
that
his
companions
in
misfortune
shrank
affrighted
from
him
as
he
passed
by
his
eyes
were
bloodshot
and
heavy
his
face
a
deadly
white
and
his
body
bent
as
if
with
age
he
had
bitten
his
under
lip
nearly
through
in
the
violence
of
his
mental
suffering
and
the
blood
which
had
flowed
from
the
wound
had
trickled
down
his
chin
and
stained
his
shirt
and
neckerchief
no
tear
or
sound
of
complaint
escaped
him
but
the
unsettled
look
and
disordered
haste
with
which
he
paced
up
and
down
the
yard
denoted
the
fever
which
was
burning
within
it
was
necessary
that
his
wife
s
body
should
be
removed
from
the
prison
without
delay
he
received
the
communication
with
perfect
calmness
and
acquiesced
in
its
propriety
nearly
all
the
inmates
of
the
prison
had
assembled
to
witness
its
removal
they
fell
back
on
either
side
when
the
widower
appeared
he
walked
hurriedly
forward
and
stationed
himself
alone
in
a
little
railed
area
close
to
the
lodge
gate
from
whence
the
crowd
with
an
instinctive
feeling
of
delicacy
had
retired
the
rude
coffin
was
borne
slowly
forward
on
men
s
shoulders
a
dead
silence
pervaded
the
throng
broken
only
by
the
audible
lamentations
of
the
women
and
the
shuffling
steps
of
the
bearers
on
the
stone
pavement
they
reached
the
spot
where
the
bereaved
husband
stood
and
stopped
he
laid
his
hand
upon
the
coffin
and
mechanically
adjusting
the
pall
with
which
it
was
covered
motioned
them
onward
the
turnkeys
in
the
prison
lobby
took
off
their
hats
as
it
passed
through
and
in
another
moment
the
heavy
gate
closed
behind
it
he
looked
vacantly
upon
the
crowd
and
fell
heavily
to
the
ground
although
for
many
weeks
after
this
he
was
watched
night
and
day
in
the
wildest
ravings
of
fever
neither
the
consciousness
of
his
loss
nor
the
recollection
of
the
vow
he
had
made
ever
left
him
for
a
moment
scenes
changed
before
his
eyes
place
succeeded
place
and
event
followed
event
in
all
the
hurry
of
delirium
but
they
were
all
connected
in
some
way
with
the
great
object
of
his
mind
he
was
sailing
over
a
boundless
expanse
of
sea
with
a
sky
above
and
the
angry
waters
lashed
into
fury
beneath
boiling
and
eddying
up
on
every
side
there
was
another
vessel
before
them
toiling
and
labouring
in
the
howling
storm
her
canvas
fluttering
in
ribbons
from
the
mast
and
her
deck
thronged
with
figures
who
were
lashed
to
the
sides
over
which
huge
waves
every
instant
burst
sweeping
away
some
devoted
creatures
into
the
foaming
sea
onward
they
bore
amidst
the
roaring
mass
of
water
with
a
speed
and
force
which
nothing
could
resist
and
striking
the
stem
of
the
foremost
vessel
crushed
her
beneath
their
keel
from
the
huge
whirlpool
which
the
sinking
wreck
occasioned
arose
a
shriek
so
loud
and
shrill
the
of
a
hundred
drowning
creatures
blended
into
one
fierce
yell
that
it
rung
far
above
the
of
the
elements
and
echoed
and
till
it
seemed
to
pierce
air
sky
and
ocean
but
what
was
that
that
old
gray
head
that
rose
above
the
water
s
surface
and
with
looks
of
agony
and
screams
for
aid
buffeted
with
the
waves
one
look
and
he
had
sprung
from
the
vessel
s
side
and
with
vigorous
strokes
was
swimming
towards
it
he
reached
it
he
was
close
upon
it
they
were
the
old
man
saw
him
coming
and
vainly
strove
to
elude
his
grasp
but
he
clasped
him
tight
and
dragged
him
beneath
the
water
down
down
with
him
fifty
fathoms
down
his
struggles
grew
fainter
and
fainter
until
they
wholly
ceased
he
was
dead
he
had
killed
him
and
had
kept
his
oath
he
was
traversing
the
scorching
sands
of
a
mighty
desert
barefoot
and
alone
the
sand
choked
and
blinded
him
its
fine
thin
grains
entered
the
very
pores
of
his
skin
and
irritated
him
almost
to
madness
gigantic
masses
of
the
same
material
carried
forward
by
the
wind
and
shone
through
by
the
burning
sun
stalked
in
the
distance
like
pillars
of
living
fire
the
bones
of
men
who
had
perished
in
the
dreary
waste
lay
scattered
at
his
feet
a
fearful
light
fell
on
everything
around
so
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
nothing
but
objects
of
dread
and
horror
presented
themselves
vainly
striving
to
utter
a
cry
of
terror
with
his
tongue
cleaving
to
his
mouth
he
rushed
madly
forward
armed
with
supernatural
strength
he
waded
through
the
sand
until
exhausted
with
fatigue
and
thirst
he
fell
senseless
on
the
earth
what
fragrant
coolness
revived
him
what
gushing
sound
was
that
water
it
was
indeed
a
well
and
the
clear
fresh
stream
was
running
at
his
feet
he
drank
deeply
of
it
and
throwing
his
aching
limbs
upon
the
bank
sank
into
a
delicious
trance
the
sound
of
approaching
footsteps
roused
him
an
old
man
tottered
forward
to
slake
his
burning
thirst
it
was
again
he
wound
his
arms
round
the
old
man
s
body
and
held
him
back
he
struggled
and
shrieked
for
water
for
but
one
drop
of
water
to
save
his
life
but
he
held
the
old
man
firmly
and
watched
his
agonies
with
greedy
eyes
and
when
his
lifeless
head
fell
forward
on
his
bosom
he
rolled
the
corpse
from
him
with
his
feet
when
the
fever
left
him
and
consciousness
returned
he
awoke
to
find
himself
rich
and
free
to
hear
that
the
parent
who
would
have
let
him
die
in
jail
who
those
who
were
far
dearer
to
him
than
his
own
existence
die
of
want
and
sickness
of
heart
that
medicine
can
not
cure
had
been
found
dead
in
his
bed
of
down
he
had
had
all
the
heart
to
leave
his
son
a
beggar
but
proud
even
of
his
health
and
strength
had
put
off
the
act
till
it
was
too
late
and
now
might
gnash
his
teeth
in
the
other
world
at
the
thought
of
the
wealth
his
remissness
had
left
him
he
awoke
to
this
and
he
awoke
to
more
to
recollect
the
purpose
for
which
he
lived
and
to
remember
that
his
enemy
was
his
wife
s
own
father
the
man
who
had
cast
him
into
prison
and
who
when
his
daughter
and
her
child
sued
at
his
feet
for
mercy
had
spurned
them
from
his
door
oh
how
he
cursed
the
weakness
that
prevented
him
from
being
up
and
active
in
his
scheme
of
vengeance
he
caused
himself
to
be
carried
from
the
scene
of
his
loss
and
misery
and
conveyed
to
a
quiet
residence
on
the
not
in
the
hope
of
recovering
his
peace
of
mind
or
happiness
for
both
were
fled
for
ever
but
to
restore
his
prostrate
energies
and
meditate
on
his
darling
object
and
here
some
evil
spirit
cast
in
his
way
the
opportunity
for
his
first
most
horrible
revenge
it
was
and
wrapped
in
his
gloomy
thoughts
he
would
issue
from
his
solitary
lodgings
early
in
the
evening
and
wandering
along
a
narrow
path
beneath
the
cliffs
to
a
wild
and
lonely
spot
that
had
struck
his
fancy
in
his
ramblings
seat
himself
on
some
fallen
fragment
of
the
rock
and
burying
his
face
in
his
hands
remain
there
for
hours
sometimes
until
night
had
completely
closed
in
and
the
long
shadows
of
the
frowning
cliffs
above
his
head
cast
a
thick
black
darkness
on
every
object
near
him
he
was
seated
here
one
calm
evening
in
his
old
position
now
and
then
raising
his
head
to
watch
the
flight
of
a
or
carry
his
eye
along
the
glorious
crimson
path
which
commencing
in
the
middle
of
the
ocean
seemed
to
lead
to
its
very
verge
where
the
sun
was
setting
when
the
profound
stillness
of
the
spot
was
broken
by
a
loud
cry
for
help
he
listened
doubtful
of
his
having
heard
aright
when
the
cry
was
repeated
with
even
greater
vehemence
than
before
and
starting
to
his
feet
he
hastened
in
the
direction
whence
it
proceeded
the
tale
told
itself
at
once
some
scattered
garments
lay
on
the
beach
a
human
head
was
just
visible
above
the
waves
at
a
little
distance
from
the
shore
and
an
old
man
wringing
his
hands
in
agony
was
running
to
and
fro
shrieking
for
assistance
the
invalid
whose
strength
was
now
sufficiently
restored
threw
off
his
coat
and
rushed
towards
the
sea
with
the
intention
of
plunging
in
and
dragging
the
drowning
man
ashore
hasten
here
sir
in
god
s
name
help
help
sir
for
the
love
of
heaven
he
is
my
son
sir
my
only
son
said
the
old
man
frantically
as
he
advanced
to
meet
him
my
only
son
sir
and
he
is
dying
before
his
father
s
eyes
at
the
first
word
the
old
man
uttered
the
stranger
checked
himself
in
his
career
and
folding
his
arms
stood
perfectly
motionless
great
god
exclaimed
the
old
man
recoiling
heyling
the
stranger
smiled
and
was
silent
heyling
said
the
old
man
wildly
my
boy
heyling
my
dear
boy
look
look
gasping
for
breath
the
miserable
father
pointed
to
the
spot
where
the
young
man
was
struggling
for
life
hark
said
the
old
man
he
cries
once
more
he
is
alive
yet
heyling
save
him
save
him
the
stranger
smiled
again
and
remained
immovable
as
a
statue
i
have
wronged
you
shrieked
the
old
man
falling
on
his
knees
and
clasping
his
hands
together
be
revenged
take
my
all
my
life
cast
me
into
the
water
at
your
feet
and
if
human
nature
can
repress
a
struggle
i
will
die
without
stirring
hand
or
foot
do
it
heyling
do
it
but
save
my
boy
he
is
so
young
heyling
so
young
to
die
listen
said
the
stranger
grasping
the
old
man
fiercely
by
the
wrist
i
will
have
life
for
life
and
here
is
child
died
before
his
father
s
eyes
a
far
more
agonising
and
painful
death
than
that
young
slanderer
of
his
sister
s
worth
is
meeting
while
i
speak
you
laughed
laughed
in
your
daughter
s
face
where
death
had
already
set
his
hand
at
our
sufferings
then
what
think
you
of
them
now
see
there
see
there
as
the
stranger
spoke
he
pointed
to
the
sea
a
faint
cry
died
away
upon
its
surface
the
last
powerful
struggle
of
the
dying
man
agitated
the
rippling
waves
for
a
few
seconds
and
the
spot
where
he
had
gone
down
into
his
early
grave
was
undistinguishable
from
the
surrounding
water
three
years
had
elapsed
when
a
gentleman
alighted
from
a
private
carriage
at
the
door
of
a
london
attorney
then
well
known
as
a
man
of
no
great
nicety
in
his
professional
dealings
and
requested
a
private
interview
on
business
of
importance
although
evidently
not
past
the
prime
of
life
his
face
was
pale
haggard
and
dejected
and
it
did
not
require
the
acute
perception
of
the
man
of
business
to
discern
at
a
glance
that
disease
or
suffering
had
done
more
to
work
a
change
in
his
appearance
than
the
mere
hand
of
time
could
have
accomplished
in
twice
the
period
of
his
whole
life
i
wish
you
to
undertake
some
legal
business
for
me
said
the
stranger
the
attorney
bowed
obsequiously
and
glanced
at
a
large
packet
which
the
gentleman
carried
in
his
hand
his
visitor
observed
the
look
and
proceeded
it
is
no
common
business
said
he
nor
have
these
papers
reached
my
hands
without
long
trouble
and
great
the
attorney
cast
a
still
more
anxious
look
at
the
packet
and
his
visitor
untying
the
string
that
bound
it
disclosed
a
quantity
of
promissory
notes
with
copies
of
deeds
and
other
documents
upon
these
papers
said
the
client
the
man
whose
name
they
bear
has
raised
as
you
will
see
large
sums
of
money
for
years
past
there
was
a
tacit
understanding
between
him
and
the
men
into
whose
hands
they
originally
went
and
from
whom
i
have
by
degrees
purchased
the
whole
for
treble
and
quadruple
their
nominal
value
that
these
loans
should
be
from
time
to
time
renewed
until
a
given
period
had
elapsed
such
an
understanding
is
nowhere
expressed
he
has
sustained
many
losses
of
late
and
these
obligations
accumulating
upon
him
at
once
would
crush
him
to
the
the
whole
amount
is
many
thousands
of
pounds
said
the
attorney
looking
over
the
papers
it
is
said
the
client
what
are
we
to
do
inquired
the
man
of
business
do
replied
the
client
with
sudden
vehemence
put
every
engine
of
the
law
in
force
every
trick
that
ingenuity
can
devise
and
rascality
execute
fair
means
and
foul
the
open
oppression
of
the
law
aided
by
all
the
craft
of
its
most
ingenious
practitioners
i
would
have
him
die
a
harassing
and
lingering
death
ruin
him
seize
and
sell
his
lands
and
goods
drive
him
from
house
and
home
and
drag
him
forth
a
beggar
in
his
old
age
to
die
in
a
common
but
the
costs
my
dear
sir
the
costs
of
all
this
reasoned
the
attorney
when
he
had
recovered
from
his
momentary
surprise
if
the
defendant
be
a
man
of
straw
who
is
to
pay
the
costs
sir
name
any
sum
said
the
stranger
his
hand
trembling
so
violently
with
excitement
that
he
could
scarcely
hold
the
pen
he
seized
as
he
spoke
any
sum
and
it
is
yours
don
t
be
afraid
to
name
it
man
i
shall
not
think
it
dear
if
you
gain
my
the
attorney
named
a
large
sum
at
hazard
as
the
advance
he
should
require
to
secure
himself
against
the
possibility
of
loss
but
more
with
the
view
of
ascertaining
how
far
his
client
was
really
disposed
to
go
than
with
any
idea
that
he
would
comply
with
the
demand
the
stranger
wrote
a
cheque
upon
his
banker
for
the
whole
amount
and
left
him
the
draft
was
duly
honoured
and
the
attorney
finding
that
his
strange
client
might
be
safely
relied
upon
commenced
his
work
in
earnest
for
more
than
two
years
afterwards
heyling
would
sit
whole
days
together
in
the
office
poring
over
the
papers
as
they
accumulated
and
reading
again
and
again
his
eyes
gleaming
with
joy
the
letters
of
remonstrance
the
prayers
for
a
little
delay
the
representations
of
the
certain
ruin
in
which
the
opposite
party
must
be
involved
which
poured
in
as
suit
after
suit
and
process
after
process
was
commenced
to
all
applications
for
a
brief
indulgence
there
was
but
one
reply
the
money
must
be
paid
land
house
furniture
each
in
its
turn
was
taken
under
some
one
of
the
numerous
executions
which
were
issued
and
the
old
man
himself
would
have
been
immured
in
prison
had
he
not
escaped
the
vigilance
of
the
officers
and
fled
the
implacable
animosity
of
heyling
so
far
from
being
satiated
by
the
success
of
his
persecution
increased
a
hundredfold
with
the
ruin
he
inflicted
on
being
informed
of
the
old
man
s
flight
his
fury
was
unbounded
he
gnashed
his
teeth
with
rage
tore
the
hair
from
his
head
and
assailed
with
horrid
imprecations
the
men
who
had
been
intrusted
with
the
writ
he
was
only
restored
to
comparative
calmness
by
repeated
assurances
of
the
certainty
of
discovering
the
fugitive
agents
were
sent
in
quest
of
him
in
all
directions
every
stratagem
that
could
be
invented
was
resorted
to
for
the
purpose
of
discovering
his
place
of
retreat
but
it
was
all
in
vain
half
a
year
had
passed
over
and
he
was
still
undiscovered
at
length
late
one
night
heyling
of
whom
nothing
had
been
seen
for
many
weeks
before
appeared
at
his
attorney
s
private
residence
and
sent
up
word
that
a
gentleman
wished
to
see
him
instantly
before
the
attorney
who
had
recognised
his
voice
from
above
stairs
could
order
the
servant
to
admit
him
he
had
rushed
up
the
staircase
and
entered
the
pale
and
breathless
having
closed
the
door
to
prevent
being
overheard
he
sank
into
a
chair
and
said
in
a
low
voice
hush
i
have
found
him
at
no
said
the
attorney
well
done
my
dear
sir
well
he
lies
concealed
in
a
wretched
lodging
in
camden
town
said
heyling
perhaps
it
is
as
well
we
sight
of
him
for
he
has
been
living
alone
there
in
the
most
abject
misery
all
the
time
and
he
is
poor
very
very
good
said
the
attorney
you
will
have
the
caption
made
morrow
of
course
yes
replied
heyling
stay
no
the
next
day
you
are
surprised
at
my
wishing
to
postpone
it
he
added
with
a
ghastly
smile
but
i
had
forgotten
the
next
day
is
an
anniversary
in
his
life
let
it
be
done
very
good
said
the
attorney
will
you
write
down
instructions
for
the
officer
no
let
him
meet
me
here
at
eight
in
the
evening
and
i
will
accompany
him
they
met
on
the
appointed
night
and
hiring
a
directed
the
driver
to
stop
at
that
corner
of
the
old
pancras
road
at
which
stands
the
parish
workhouse
by
the
time
they
alighted
there
it
was
quite
dark
and
proceeding
by
the
dead
wall
in
front
of
the
veterinary
hospital
they
entered
a
small
which
is
or
was
at
that
time
called
little
college
street
and
which
whatever
it
may
be
now
was
in
those
days
a
desolate
place
enough
surrounded
by
little
else
than
fields
and
ditches
having
drawn
the
he
had
on
half
over
his
face
and
muffled
himself
in
his
cloak
heyling
stopped
before
the
house
in
the
street
and
knocked
gently
at
the
door
it
was
at
once
opened
by
a
woman
who
dropped
a
curtsey
of
recognition
and
heyling
whispering
the
officer
to
remain
below
crept
gently
upstairs
and
opening
the
door
of
the
front
room
entered
at
once
the
object
of
his
search
and
his
unrelenting
animosity
now
a
decrepit
old
man
was
seated
at
a
bare
deal
table
on
which
stood
a
miserable
candle
he
started
on
the
entrance
of
the
stranger
and
rose
feebly
to
his
feet
what
now
what
now
said
the
old
man
what
fresh
misery
is
this
what
do
you
want
here
a
word
with
replied
heyling
as
he
spoke
he
seated
himself
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
and
throwing
off
his
cloak
and
cap
disclosed
his
features
the
old
man
seemed
instantly
deprived
of
speech
he
fell
backward
in
his
chair
and
clasping
his
hands
together
gazed
on
the
apparition
with
a
mingled
look
of
abhorrence
and
fear
this
day
six
years
said
heyling
i
claimed
the
life
you
owed
me
for
my
child
s
beside
the
lifeless
form
of
your
daughter
old
man
i
swore
to
live
a
life
of
revenge
i
have
never
swerved
from
my
purpose
for
a
moment
s
space
but
if
i
had
one
thought
of
her
uncomplaining
suffering
look
as
she
drooped
away
or
of
the
starving
face
of
our
innocent
child
would
have
nerved
me
to
my
task
my
first
act
of
requital
you
well
remember
this
is
my
the
old
man
shivered
and
his
hands
dropped
powerless
by
his
side
i
leave
england
said
heyling
after
a
moment
s
pause
night
i
consign
you
to
the
living
death
to
which
you
devoted
her
a
hopeless
prison
he
raised
his
eyes
to
the
old
man
s
countenance
and
paused
he
lifted
the
light
to
his
face
set
it
gently
down
and
left
the
apartment
you
had
better
see
to
the
old
man
he
said
to
the
woman
as
he
opened
the
door
and
motioned
the
officer
to
follow
him
into
the
street
i
think
he
is
the
woman
closed
the
door
ran
hastily
upstairs
and
found
him
lifeless
beneath
a
plain
gravestone
in
one
of
the
most
peaceful
and
secluded
churchyards
in
kent
where
wild
flowers
mingle
with
the
grass
and
the
soft
landscape
around
forms
the
fairest
spot
in
the
garden
of
england
lie
the
bones
of
the
young
mother
and
her
gentle
child
but
the
ashes
of
the
father
do
not
mingle
with
theirs
nor
from
that
night
forward
did
the
attorney
ever
gain
the
remotest
clue
to
the
subsequent
history
of
his
queer
as
the
old
man
concluded
his
tale
he
advanced
to
a
peg
in
one
corner
and
taking
down
his
hat
and
coat
put
them
on
with
great
deliberation
and
without
saying
another
word
walked
slowly
away
as
the
gentleman
with
the
mosaic
studs
had
fallen
asleep
and
the
major
part
of
the
company
were
deeply
occupied
in

of
dropping

and
a
white
neckcloth
rushes
up
and
sings
out
here
s
the
shepherd
to
wisit

a
great
white

avay
like

such
goin

on
sammy
the

shepherd
and
then
he
kissed
the
women
all
round
and
ven
he
d
done
the
man
vith
the
red
nose
began
i
was
just
whether
i
hadn

better
begin
too
specially
as
there
was
a
wery
nice
lady
next
me
ven
in
comes

and
your

never

but
he
was
nothin
to
the
shepherd
well
arter
the
tea
was
over
they
sang
another
hymn
and
then
the
shepherd
began
to
preach
and
wery
well
he
did
it
considerin
how
heavy
them
muffins
must
have
lied
on
his
chest
presently
he
pulls
up
all
of
a
sudden
and
hollers
out
where
is
the
sinner
where
is
the
mis
rable
sinner
upon
which
all
the
women
looked
at
me
and
began
to
groan
as
if
they
was
i
thought
it
was
rather
sing
ler
but
howsoever
i
says
nothing
presently
he
pulls
up
again
and
lookin
wery
hard
at
me
says
where
is
the
sinner
where
is
the
mis
rable
sinner
and
all
the
women
groans
again
ten
times
louder
than
afore
i
got
rather
savage
at
this
so
i
takes
a
step
or
two
for
ard
and
says
my
friend
says
i
did
you
apply
that
ere
obserwation
to
me
stead
of
beggin
my
pardon
as
any
gen
l
m
n
would
ha
done
he
got
more
abusive
than
ever
called
me
a
wessel
sammy
a
wessel
of
wrath
and
all
sorts
o
names
so
my
blood
being
reg
larly
up
i
first
gave
him
two
or
three
for
himself
and
then
two
or
three
more
to
hand
over
to
the
man
with
the
red
nose
and
walked
off
i
wish
you
could
ha
heard
how
the
women
screamed
sammy
ven
they
picked
up
the
shepherd
from
underneath
the
table
hollo
here
s
the
governor
the
size
of
as
weller
spoke
pickwick
dismounted
from
a
cab
and
entered
the
yard
fine
mornin
sir
said
weller
senior
beautiful
indeed
replied
pickwick
beautiful
indeed
echoes
a
man
with
an
inquisitive
nose
and
green
spectacles
who
had
unpacked
himself
from
a
cab
at
the
same
moment
as
pickwick
going
to
ipswich
sir
i
am
replied
pickwick
extraordinary
coincidence
so
am
pickwick
bowed
going
outside
said
the
man
pickwick
bowed
again
bless
my
soul
how
remarkable
i
am
going
outside
too
said
the
haired
man
we
are
positively
going
and
the
man
who
was
an
personage
with
a
habit
of
giving
his
head
a
jerk
every
time
he
said
anything
smiled
as
if
he
had
made
one
of
the
strangest
discoveries
that
ever
fell
to
the
lot
of
human
wisdom
i
am
happy
in
the
prospect
of
your
company
sir
said
pickwick
ah
said
the
it
s
a
good
thing
for
both
of
us
isn
t
it
company
you
see
company
is
is
it
s
a
very
different
thing
from
solitude
ain
t
it
there
s
no
denying
that
ere
said
weller
joining
in
the
conversation
with
an
affable
smile
that
s
what
i
call
a
proposition
as
the
dog
man
said
when
the
housemaid
told
him
he
warn
t
a
ah
said
the
man
surveying
weller
from
head
to
foot
with
a
supercilious
look
friend
of
yours
sir
not
exactly
a
friend
replied
pickwick
in
a
low
tone
the
fact
is
he
is
my
servant
but
i
allow
him
to
take
a
good
many
liberties
for
between
ourselves
i
flatter
myself
he
is
an
original
and
i
am
rather
proud
of
ah
said
the
man
that
you
see
is
a
matter
of
taste
i
am
not
fond
of
anything
original
i
don
t
like
it
don
t
see
the
necessity
for
it
what
s
your
name
sir
here
is
my
card
sir
replied
pickwick
much
amused
by
the
abruptness
of
the
question
and
the
singular
manner
of
the
stranger
ah
said
the
man
placing
the
card
in
his
pickwick
very
good
i
like
to
know
a
man
s
name
it
saves
so
much
trouble
that
s
my
card
sir
magnus
you
will
perceive
sir
magnus
is
my
name
it
s
rather
a
good
name
i
think
a
very
good
name
indeed
said
pickwick
wholly
unable
to
repress
a
smile
yes
i
think
it
is
resumed
magnus
there
s
a
good
name
before
it
too
you
will
observe
permit
me
sir
if
you
hold
the
card
a
little
slanting
this
way
you
catch
the
light
upon
the
there
peter
magnus
sounds
well
i
think
very
said
pickwick
curious
circumstance
about
those
initials
sir
said
magnus
you
will
observe
post
meridian
in
hasty
notes
to
intimate
acquaintance
i
sometimes
sign
myself
it
amuses
my
friends
very
much
it
is
calculated
to
afford
them
the
highest
gratification
i
should
conceive
said
pickwick
rather
envying
the
ease
with
which
magnus
s
friends
were
entertained
now
gen
l
m
n
said
the
hostler
coach
is
ready
if
you
is
all
my
luggage
in
inquired
magnus
all
right
is
the
red
bag
in
all
right
and
the
striped
bag
fore
boot
and
the
parcel
under
the
seat
and
the
leather
they
re
all
in
now
will
you
get
up
said
pickwick
excuse
me
replied
magnus
standing
on
the
wheel
excuse
me
pickwick
i
can
not
consent
to
get
up
in
this
state
of
uncertainty
i
am
quite
satisfied
from
that
man
s
manner
that
the
leather
is
not
the
solemn
protestations
of
the
hostler
being
wholly
unavailing
the
leather
was
obliged
to
be
raked
up
from
the
lowest
depth
of
the
boot
to
satisfy
him
that
it
had
been
safely
packed
and
after
he
had
been
assured
on
this
head
he
felt
a
solemn
presentiment
first
that
the
red
bag
was
mislaid
and
next
that
the
striped
bag
had
been
stolen
and
then
that
the
parcel
had
come
at
length
when
he
had
received
ocular
demonstration
of
the
groundless
nature
of
each
and
every
of
these
suspicions
he
consented
to
climb
up
to
the
roof
of
the
coach
observing
that
now
he
had
taken
everything
off
his
mind
he
felt
quite
comfortable
and
happy
you
re
given
to
nervousness
ain
t
you
sir
inquired
weller
senior
eyeing
the
stranger
askance
as
he
mounted
to
his
place
yes
i
always
am
rather
about
these
little
matters
said
the
stranger
but
i
am
all
right
now
quite
well
that
s
a
blessin
said
weller
sammy

your
master
up
to
the
box

leg
sir
that
s
it
give
us
your
hand
sir
up
with
you
you
was
a
lighter
weight
when
you
was
a
boy
true
enough
that
weller
said
the
breathless
pickwick
humouredly
as
he
took
his
seat
on
the
box
beside
him
jump
up
in
front
sammy
said
weller
now
villam

as
the
pieman
says
that

and
away
went
the
coach
up
whitechapel
to
the
admiration
of
the
whole
population
of
that
pretty
densely
populated
quarter
not
a
wery
nice
neighbourhood
this
sir
said
sam
with
a
touch
of
the
hat
which
always
preceded
his
entering
into
conversation
with
his
master
it
is
not
indeed
sam
replied
pickwick
surveying
the
crowded
and
filthy
street
through
which
they
were
passing
it
s
a
wery
remarkable
circumstance
sir
said
sam
that
poverty
and
oysters
always
seem
to
go
i
don
t
understand
you
sam
said
pickwick
what
i
mean
sir
said
sam
is
that
the
poorer
a
place
is
the
greater
call
there
seems
to
be
for
oysters
look
here
sir
here
s
a
to
every
houses
the
street
s
lined
vith
em
blessed
if
i
don
t
think
that
ven
a
man
s
wery
poor
he
rushes
out
of
his
lodgings
and
eats
oysters
in
reg
lar
to
be
sure
he
does
said
weller
senior
and
it
s
just
the
same
vith
pickled
salmon
those
are
two
very
remarkable
facts
which
never
occurred
to
me
before
said
pickwick
the
very
first
place
we
stop
at
i
ll
make
a
note
of
by
this
time
they
had
reached
the
turnpike
at
mile
end
a
profound
silence
prevailed
until
they
had
got
two
or
three
miles
farther
on
when
weller
senior
turning
suddenly
to
pickwick
said
wery
queer
life
is
a
s
a
what
said
pickwick
a
what
do
you
mean
by
a
inquired
peter
magnus
the
old
un
means
a
gen
l
m
n
observed
samuel
weller
in
explanation
oh
said
pickwick
i
see
yes
very
curious
life
very
they
re
all
on
em
men
as
has
met
vith
some
disappointment
in
life
said
weller
senior
ay
ay
said
pickwick
yes
consequence
of
vich
they
retires
from
the
world
and
shuts
themselves
up
in
pikes
partly
with
the
view
of
being
solitary
and
partly
to
rewenge
themselves
on
mankind
by
takin
dear
me
said
pickwick
i
never
knew
that
fact
sir
said
weller
if
they
was
gen
l
m
n
you
d
call
em
misanthropes
but
as
it
is
they
only
takes
to
with
such
conversation
possessing
the
inestimable
charm
of
blending
amusement
with
instruction
did
weller
beguile
the
tediousness
of
the
journey
during
the
greater
part
of
the
day
topics
of
conversation
were
never
wanting
for
even
when
any
pause
occurred
in
weller
s
loquacity
it
was
abundantly
supplied
by
the
desire
evinced
by
magnus
to
make
himself
acquainted
with
the
whole
of
the
personal
history
of
his
and
his
anxiety
at
every
stage
respecting
the
safety
and
of
the
two
bags
the
leather
and
the
parcel
in
the
main
street
of
ipswich
on
the
side
of
the
way
a
short
distance
after
you
have
passed
through
the
open
space
fronting
the
town
hall
stands
an
inn
known
far
and
wide
by
the
appellation
of
the
great
white
horse
rendered
the
more
conspicuous
by
a
stone
statue
of
some
rampacious
animal
with
flowing
mane
and
tail
distantly
resembling
an
insane
which
is
elevated
above
the
principal
door
the
great
white
horse
is
famous
in
the
neighbourhood
in
the
same
degree
as
a
prize
ox
or
a
turnip
or
unwieldy
pig
for
its
enormous
size
never
was
such
labyrinths
of
uncarpeted
passages
such
clusters
of
mouldy
rooms
such
huge
numbers
of
small
dens
for
eating
or
sleeping
in
beneath
any
one
roof
as
are
collected
together
between
the
four
walls
of
the
great
white
horse
at
ipswich
it
was
at
the
door
of
this
overgrown
tavern
that
the
london
coach
stopped
at
the
same
hour
every
evening
and
it
was
from
this
same
london
coach
that
pickwick
sam
weller
and
peter
magnus
dismounted
on
the
particular
evening
to
which
this
chapter
of
our
history
bears
reference
do
you
stop
here
sir
inquired
peter
magnus
when
the
striped
bag
and
the
red
bag
and
the
parcel
and
the
leather
box
had
all
been
deposited
in
the
passage
do
you
stop
here
sir
i
do
said
pickwick
dear
me
said
magnus
i
never
knew
anything
like
these
extraordinary
coincidences
why
i
stop
here
too
i
hope
we
dine
together
with
pleasure
replied
pickwick
i
am
not
quite
certain
whether
i
have
any
friends
here
or
not
though
is
there
any
gentleman
of
the
name
of
tupman
here
waiter
a
corpulent
man
with
a
fortnight
s
napkin
under
his
arm
and
coeval
stockings
on
his
legs
slowly
desisted
from
his
occupation
of
staring
down
the
street
on
this
question
being
put
to
him
by
pickwick
and
after
minutely
inspecting
that
gentleman
s
appearance
from
the
crown
of
his
hat
to
the
lowest
button
of
his
gaiters
replied
emphatically
no
nor
any
gentleman
of
the
name
of
snodgrass
inquired
pickwick
no
nor
winkle
no
my
friends
have
not
arrived
sir
said
pickwick
we
will
dine
alone
then
show
us
a
private
room
on
this
request
being
preferred
the
corpulent
man
condescended
to
order
the
boots
to
bring
in
the
gentlemen
s
luggage
and
preceding
them
down
a
long
dark
passage
ushered
them
into
a
large
apartment
with
a
dirty
grate
in
which
a
small
fire
was
making
a
wretched
attempt
to
be
cheerful
but
was
fast
sinking
beneath
the
dispiriting
influence
of
the
place
after
the
lapse
of
an
hour
a
bit
of
fish
and
a
steak
was
served
up
to
the
travellers
and
when
the
dinner
was
cleared
away
pickwick
and
peter
magnus
drew
their
chairs
up
to
the
fire
and
having
ordered
a
bottle
of
the
worst
possible
port
wine
at
the
highest
possible
price
for
the
good
of
the
house
drank
for
their
own
peter
magnus
was
naturally
of
a
very
communicative
disposition
and
the
operated
with
wonderful
effect
in
warming
into
life
the
deepest
hidden
secrets
of
his
bosom
after
sundry
accounts
of
himself
his
family
his
connections
his
friends
his
jokes
his
business
and
his
brothers
most
talkative
men
have
a
great
deal
to
say
about
their
brothers
peter
magnus
took
a
view
of
pickwick
through
his
coloured
spectacles
for
several
minutes
and
then
said
with
an
air
of
modesty
and
what
do
you
think
what
you
think
pickwick
i
have
come
down
here
for
upon
my
word
said
pickwick
it
is
wholly
impossible
for
me
to
guess
on
business
partly
right
sir
replied
peter
magnus
but
partly
wrong
at
the
same
time
try
again
really
said
pickwick
i
must
throw
myself
on
your
mercy
to
tell
me
or
not
as
you
may
think
best
for
i
should
never
guess
if
i
were
to
try
all
why
then
said
peter
magnus
with
a
bashful
titter
what
should
you
think
pickwick
if
i
had
come
down
here
to
make
a
proposal
sir
eh
he
he
he
think
that
you
are
very
likely
to
succeed
replied
pickwick
with
one
of
his
beaming
smiles
ah
said
magnus
but
do
you
really
think
so
pickwick
do
you
though
certainly
said
pickwick
no
but
you
re
joking
i
am
not
why
then
said
magnus
to
let
you
into
a
little
secret
i
think
so
too
i
don
t
mind
telling
you
pickwick
although
i
m
dreadful
jealous
by
nature
horrid
that
the
lady
is
in
this
here
magnus
took
off
his
spectacles
on
purpose
to
wink
and
then
put
them
on
again
that
s
what
you
were
running
out
of
the
room
for
before
dinner
then
so
often
said
pickwick
archly
hush
yes
you
re
right
that
was
it
not
such
a
fool
as
to
see
her
no
no
wouldn
t
do
you
know
after
having
just
come
off
a
journey
wait
till
sir
double
the
chance
then
pickwick
sir
there
is
a
suit
of
clothes
in
that
bag
and
a
hat
in
that
box
which
i
expect
in
the
effect
they
will
produce
will
be
invaluable
to
me
indeed
said
pickwick
yes
you
must
have
observed
my
anxiety
about
them
i
do
not
believe
that
such
another
suit
of
clothes
and
such
a
hat
could
be
bought
for
money
pickwick
congratulated
the
fortunate
owner
of
the
irresistible
garments
on
their
acquisition
and
peter
magnus
remained
a
few
moments
apparently
absorbed
in
contemplation
she
s
a
fine
creature
said
magnus
is
she
said
pickwick
very
said
magnus
very
she
lives
about
twenty
miles
from
here
pickwick
i
heard
she
would
be
here
and
all
forenoon
and
came
down
to
seize
the
opportunity
i
think
an
inn
is
a
good
sort
of
a
place
to
propose
to
a
single
woman
in
pickwick
she
is
more
likely
to
feel
the
loneliness
of
her
situation
in
travelling
perhaps
than
she
would
be
at
home
what
do
you
think
pickwick
i
think
it
is
very
probable
replied
that
gentleman
i
beg
your
pardon
pickwick
said
peter
magnus
but
i
am
naturally
rather
curious
what
may
you
have
come
down
here
for
on
a
far
less
pleasant
errand
sir
replied
pickwick
the
colour
mounting
to
his
face
at
the
recollection
i
have
come
down
here
sir
to
expose
the
treachery
and
falsehood
of
an
individual
upon
whose
truth
and
honour
i
placed
implicit
dear
me
said
peter
magnus
that
s
very
unpleasant
it
is
a
lady
i
presume
eh
ah
sly
pickwick
sly
well
pickwick
sir
i
wouldn
t
probe
your
feelings
for
the
world
painful
subjects
these
sir
very
painful
don
t
mind
me
pickwick
if
you
wish
to
give
vent
to
your
feelings
i
know
what
it
is
to
be
jilted
sir
i
have
endured
that
sort
of
thing
three
or
four
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
your
condolence
on
what
you
presume
to
be
my
melancholy
case
said
pickwick
winding
up
his
watch
and
laying
it
on
the
table
but
no
no
said
peter
magnus
not
a
word
more
it
s
a
painful
subject
i
see
i
see
what
s
the
time
pickwick
past
dear
me
it
s
time
to
go
to
bed
it
will
never
do
sitting
here
i
shall
be
pale
at
the
bare
notion
of
such
a
calamity
peter
magnus
rang
the
bell
for
the
chambermaid
and
the
striped
bag
the
red
bag
the
leathern
box
and
the
parcel
having
been
conveyed
to
his
bedroom
he
retired
in
company
with
a
japanned
candlestick
to
one
side
of
the
house
while
pickwick
and
another
japanned
candlestick
were
conducted
through
a
multitude
of
tortuous
windings
to
another
this
is
your
room
sir
said
the
chambermaid
very
well
replied
pickwick
looking
round
him
it
was
a
tolerably
large
room
with
a
fire
upon
the
whole
a
more
apartment
than
pickwick
s
short
experience
of
the
accommodations
of
the
great
white
horse
had
led
him
to
expect
nobody
sleeps
in
the
other
bed
of
course
said
pickwick
oh
no
very
good
tell
my
servant
to
bring
me
up
some
hot
water
at
eight
in
the
morning
and
that
i
shall
not
want
him
any
more
yes
sir
and
bidding
pickwick
the
chambermaid
retired
and
left
him
alone
pickwick
sat
himself
down
in
a
chair
before
the
fire
and
fell
into
a
train
of
rambling
meditations
first
he
thought
of
his
friends
and
wondered
when
they
would
join
him
then
his
mind
reverted
to
martha
bardell
and
from
that
lady
it
wandered
by
a
natural
process
to
the
dingy
of
dodson
fogg
from
dodson
fogg
s
it
flew
off
at
a
tangent
to
the
very
centre
of
the
history
of
the
queer
client
and
then
it
came
back
to
the
great
white
horse
at
ipswich
with
sufficient
clearness
to
convince
pickwick
that
he
was
falling
asleep
so
he
roused
himself
and
began
to
undress
when
he
recollected
he
had
left
his
watch
on
the
table
downstairs
now
this
watch
was
a
special
favourite
with
pickwick
having
been
carried
about
beneath
the
shadow
of
his
waistcoat
for
a
greater
number
of
years
than
we
feel
called
upon
to
state
at
present
the
possibility
of
going
to
sleep
unless
it
were
ticking
gently
beneath
his
pillow
or
in
the
over
his
head
had
never
entered
pickwick
s
brain
so
as
it
was
pretty
late
now
and
he
was
unwilling
to
ring
his
bell
at
that
hour
of
the
night
he
slipped
on
his
coat
of
which
he
had
just
divested
himself
and
taking
the
japanned
candlestick
in
his
hand
walked
quietly
downstairs
the
more
stairs
pickwick
went
down
the
more
stairs
there
seemed
to
be
to
descend
and
again
and
again
when
pickwick
got
into
some
narrow
passage
and
began
to
congratulate
himself
on
having
gained
the
did
another
flight
of
stairs
appear
before
his
astonished
eyes
at
last
he
reached
a
stone
hall
which
he
remembered
to
have
seen
when
he
entered
the
house
passage
after
passage
did
he
explore
room
after
room
did
he
peep
into
at
length
as
he
was
on
the
point
of
giving
up
the
search
in
despair
he
opened
the
door
of
the
identical
room
in
which
he
had
spent
the
evening
and
beheld
his
missing
property
on
the
table
pickwick
seized
the
watch
in
triumph
and
proceeded
to
retrace
his
steps
to
his
bedchamber
if
his
progress
downward
had
been
attended
with
difficulties
and
uncertainty
his
journey
back
was
infinitely
more
perplexing
rows
of
doors
garnished
with
boots
of
every
shape
make
and
size
branched
off
in
every
possible
direction
a
dozen
times
did
he
softly
turn
the
handle
of
some
bedroom
door
which
resembled
his
own
when
a
gruff
cry
from
within
of
who
the
devil
s
that
or
what
do
you
want
here
caused
him
to
steal
away
on
tiptoe
with
a
perfectly
marvellous
celerity
he
was
reduced
to
the
verge
of
despair
when
an
open
door
attracted
his
attention
he
peeped
in
right
at
last
there
were
the
two
beds
whose
situation
he
perfectly
remembered
and
the
fire
still
burning
his
candle
not
a
long
one
when
he
first
received
it
had
flickered
away
in
the
drafts
of
air
through
which
he
had
passed
and
sank
into
the
socket
as
he
closed
the
door
after
him
no
matter
said
pickwick
i
can
undress
myself
just
as
well
by
the
light
of
the
the
bedsteads
stood
one
on
each
side
of
the
door
and
on
the
inner
side
of
each
was
a
little
path
terminating
in
a
chair
just
wide
enough
to
admit
of
a
person
s
getting
into
or
out
of
bed
on
that
side
if
he
or
she
thought
proper
having
carefully
drawn
the
curtains
of
his
bed
on
the
outside
pickwick
sat
down
on
the
chair
and
leisurely
divested
himself
of
his
shoes
and
gaiters
he
then
took
off
and
folded
up
his
coat
waistcoat
and
neckcloth
and
slowly
drawing
on
his
tasselled
nightcap
secured
it
firmly
on
his
head
by
tying
beneath
his
chin
the
strings
which
he
always
had
attached
to
that
article
of
dress
it
was
at
this
moment
that
the
absurdity
of
his
recent
bewilderment
struck
upon
his
mind
throwing
himself
back
in
the
bottomed
chair
pickwick
laughed
to
himself
so
heartily
that
it
would
have
been
quite
delightful
to
any
man
of
mind
to
have
watched
the
smiles
that
expanded
his
amiable
features
as
they
shone
forth
from
beneath
the
nightcap
it
is
the
best
idea
said
pickwick
to
himself
smiling
till
he
almost
cracked
the
nightcap
strings
it
is
the
best
idea
my
losing
myself
in
this
place
and
wandering
about
these
staircases
that
i
ever
heard
of
droll
droll
very
here
pickwick
smiled
again
a
broader
smile
than
before
and
was
about
to
continue
the
process
of
undressing
in
the
best
possible
humour
when
he
was
suddenly
stopped
by
a
most
unexpected
interruption
to
wit
the
entrance
into
the
room
of
some
person
with
a
candle
who
after
locking
the
door
advanced
to
the
and
set
down
the
light
upon
it
the
smile
that
played
on
pickwick
s
features
was
instantaneously
lost
in
a
look
of
the
most
unbounded
and
surprise
the
person
whoever
it
was
had
come
in
so
suddenly
and
with
so
little
noise
that
pickwick
had
had
no
time
to
call
out
or
oppose
their
entrance
who
could
it
be
a
robber
some
person
who
had
seen
him
come
upstairs
with
a
handsome
watch
in
his
hand
perhaps
what
was
he
to
do
the
only
way
in
which
pickwick
could
catch
a
glimpse
of
his
mysterious
visitor
with
the
least
danger
of
being
seen
himself
was
by
creeping
on
to
the
bed
and
peeping
out
from
between
the
curtains
on
the
opposite
side
to
this
manoeuvre
he
accordingly
resorted
keeping
the
curtains
carefully
closed
with
his
hand
so
that
nothing
more
of
him
could
be
seen
than
his
face
and
nightcap
and
putting
on
his
spectacles
he
mustered
up
courage
and
looked
out
pickwick
almost
fainted
with
horror
and
dismay
standing
before
the
was
a
lady
in
yellow
busily
engaged
in
brushing
what
ladies
call
their
however
the
unconscious
lady
came
into
that
room
it
was
quite
clear
that
she
contemplated
remaining
there
for
the
night
for
she
had
brought
a
rushlight
and
shade
with
her
which
with
praiseworthy
precaution
against
fire
she
had
stationed
in
a
basin
on
the
floor
where
it
was
glimmering
away
like
a
gigantic
lighthouse
in
a
particularly
small
piece
of
water
bless
my
soul
thought
pickwick
what
a
dreadful
thing
hem
said
the
lady
and
in
went
pickwick
s
head
with
like
rapidity
i
never
met
with
anything
so
awful
as
this
thought
poor
pickwick
the
cold
perspiration
starting
in
drops
upon
his
nightcap
never
this
is
it
was
quite
impossible
to
resist
the
urgent
desire
to
see
what
was
going
forward
so
out
went
pickwick
s
head
again
the
prospect
was
worse
than
before
the
lady
had
finished
arranging
her
hair
had
carefully
enveloped
it
in
a
muslin
nightcap
with
a
small
plaited
border
and
was
gazing
pensively
on
the
fire
this
matter
is
growing
alarming
reasoned
pickwick
with
himself
i
can
t
allow
things
to
go
on
in
this
way
by
the
of
that
lady
it
is
clear
to
me
that
i
must
have
come
into
the
wrong
room
if
i
call
out
she
ll
alarm
the
house
but
if
i
remain
here
the
consequences
will
be
still
more
pickwick
it
is
quite
unnecessary
to
say
was
one
of
the
most
modest
and
of
mortals
the
very
idea
of
exhibiting
his
nightcap
to
a
lady
overpowered
him
but
he
had
tied
those
confounded
strings
in
a
knot
and
do
what
he
would
he
couldn
t
get
it
off
the
disclosure
must
be
made
there
was
only
one
other
way
of
doing
it
he
shrunk
behind
the
curtains
and
called
out
very
loudly
that
the
lady
started
at
this
unexpected
sound
was
evident
by
her
falling
up
against
the
rushlight
shade
that
she
persuaded
herself
it
must
have
been
the
effect
of
imagination
was
equally
clear
for
when
pickwick
under
the
impression
that
she
had
fainted
away
with
fright
ventured
to
peep
out
again
she
was
gazing
pensively
on
the
fire
as
before
most
extraordinary
female
this
thought
pickwick
popping
in
again
these
last
sounds
so
like
those
in
which
as
legends
inform
us
the
ferocious
giant
blunderbore
was
in
the
habit
of
expressing
his
opinion
that
it
was
time
to
lay
the
cloth
were
too
distinctly
audible
to
be
again
mistaken
for
the
workings
of
fancy
gracious
heaven
said
the
lady
what
s
that
it
s
it
s
only
a
gentleman
ma
am
said
pickwick
from
behind
the
curtains
a
gentleman
said
the
lady
with
a
terrific
scream
it
s
all
over
thought
pickwick
a
strange
man
shrieked
the
lady
another
instant
and
the
house
would
be
alarmed
her
garments
rustled
as
she
rushed
towards
the
door
ma
am
said
pickwick
thrusting
out
his
head
in
the
extremity
of
his
desperation
ma
am
now
although
pickwick
was
not
actuated
by
any
definite
object
in
putting
out
his
head
it
was
instantaneously
productive
of
a
good
effect
the
lady
as
we
have
already
stated
was
near
the
door
she
must
pass
it
to
reach
the
staircase
and
she
would
most
undoubtedly
have
done
so
by
this
time
had
not
the
sudden
apparition
of
pickwick
s
nightcap
driven
her
back
into
the
remotest
corner
of
the
apartment
where
she
stood
staring
wildly
at
pickwick
while
pickwick
in
his
turn
stared
wildly
at
her
wretch
said
the
lady
covering
her
eyes
with
her
hands
what
do
you
want
here
nothing
ma
am
nothing
whatever
ma
am
said
pickwick
earnestly
nothing
said
the
lady
looking
up
nothing
ma
am
upon
my
honour
said
pickwick
nodding
his
head
so
energetically
that
the
tassel
of
his
nightcap
danced
again
i
am
almost
ready
to
sink
ma
am
beneath
the
confusion
of
addressing
a
lady
in
my
nightcap
here
the
lady
hastily
snatched
off
hers
but
i
can
t
get
it
off
ma
am
here
pickwick
gave
it
a
tremendous
tug
in
proof
of
the
statement
it
is
evident
to
me
ma
am
now
that
i
have
mistaken
this
bedroom
for
my
own
i
had
not
been
here
five
minutes
ma
am
when
you
suddenly
entered
if
this
improbable
story
be
really
true
sir
said
the
lady
sobbing
violently
you
will
leave
it
i
will
ma
am
with
the
greatest
pleasure
replied
pickwick
instantly
sir
said
the
lady
certainly
ma
am
interposed
pickwick
very
quickly
certainly
ma
am
i
i
am
very
sorry
ma
am
said
pickwick
making
his
appearance
at
the
bottom
of
the
bed
to
have
been
the
innocent
occasion
of
this
alarm
and
emotion
deeply
sorry
ma
the
lady
pointed
to
the
door
one
excellent
quality
of
pickwick
s
character
was
beautifully
displayed
at
this
moment
under
the
most
trying
circumstances
although
he
had
hastily
put
on
his
hat
over
his
nightcap
after
the
manner
of
the
old
patrol
although
he
carried
his
shoes
and
gaiters
in
his
hand
and
his
coat
and
waistcoat
over
his
arm
nothing
could
subdue
his
native
politeness
i
am
exceedingly
sorry
ma
am
said
pickwick
bowing
very
low
if
you
are
sir
you
will
at
once
leave
the
room
said
the
lady
immediately
ma
am
this
instant
ma
am
said
pickwick
opening
the
door
and
dropping
both
his
shoes
with
a
crash
in
so
doing
i
trust
ma
am
resumed
pickwick
gathering
up
his
shoes
and
turning
round
to
bow
again
i
trust
ma
am
that
my
unblemished
character
and
the
devoted
respect
i
entertain
for
your
sex
will
plead
as
some
slight
excuse
for
this
but
before
pickwick
could
conclude
the
sentence
the
lady
had
thrust
him
into
the
passage
and
locked
and
bolted
the
door
behind
him
whatever
grounds
of
pickwick
might
have
for
having
escaped
so
quietly
from
his
late
awkward
situation
his
present
position
was
by
no
means
enviable
he
was
alone
in
an
open
passage
in
a
strange
house
in
the
middle
of
the
night
half
dressed
it
was
not
to
be
supposed
that
he
could
find
his
way
in
perfect
darkness
to
a
room
which
he
had
been
wholly
unable
to
discover
with
a
light
and
if
he
made
the
slightest
noise
in
his
fruitless
attempts
to
do
so
he
stood
every
chance
of
being
shot
at
and
perhaps
killed
by
some
wakeful
traveller
he
had
no
resource
but
to
remain
where
he
was
until
daylight
appeared
so
after
groping
his
way
a
few
paces
down
the
passage
and
to
his
infinite
alarm
stumbling
over
several
pairs
of
boots
in
so
doing
pickwick
crouched
into
a
little
recess
in
the
wall
to
wait
for
morning
as
philosophically
as
he
might
he
was
not
destined
however
to
undergo
this
additional
trial
of
patience
for
he
had
not
been
long
ensconced
in
his
present
concealment
when
to
his
unspeakable
horror
a
man
bearing
a
light
appeared
at
the
end
of
the
passage
his
horror
was
suddenly
converted
into
joy
however
when
he
recognised
the
form
of
his
faithful
attendant
it
was
indeed
samuel
weller
who
after
sitting
up
thus
late
in
conversation
with
the
boots
who
was
sitting
up
for
the
mail
was
now
about
to
retire
to
rest
sam
said
pickwick
suddenly
appearing
before
him
where
s
my
bedroom
weller
stared
at
his
master
with
the
most
emphatic
surprise
and
it
was
not
until
the
question
had
been
repeated
three
several
times
that
he
turned
round
and
led
the
way
to
the
apartment
sam
said
pickwick
as
he
got
into
bed
i
have
made
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
mistakes
that
ever
were
heard
wery
likely
sir
replied
weller
drily
but
of
this
i
am
determined
sam
said
pickwick
that
if
i
were
to
stop
in
this
house
for
six
months
i
would
never
trust
myself
about
it
alone
that
s
the
wery
prudentest
resolution
as
you
could
come
to
sir
replied
weller
you
rayther
want
somebody
to
look
arter
you
sir
when
your
judgment
goes
out
a
wisitin
what
do
you
mean
by
that
sam
said
pickwick
he
raised
himself
in
bed
and
extended
his
hand
as
if
he
were
about
to
say
something
more
but
suddenly
checking
himself
turned
round
and
bade
his
valet
sir
replied
weller
he
paused
when
he
got
outside
the
door
shook
his
head
walked
on
stopped
snuffed
the
candle
shook
his
head
again
and
finally
proceeded
slowly
to
his
chamber
apparently
buried
in
the
profoundest
meditation
chapter
xxiii
in
which
samuel
weller
begins
to
devote
his
energies
to
the
return
match
between
himself
and
trotter
in
a
small
room
in
the
vicinity
of
the
stableyard
betimes
in
the
morning
which
was
ushered
in
by
pickwick
s
adventure
with
the
middle
aged
lady
in
the
yellow
sat
weller
senior
preparing
himself
for
his
journey
to
london
he
was
sitting
in
an
excellent
attitude
for
having
his
portrait
taken
and
here
it
is
it
is
very
possible
that
at
some
earlier
period
of
his
career
weller
s
profile
might
have
presented
a
bold
and
determined
outline
his
face
however
had
expanded
under
the
influence
of
good
living
and
a
disposition
remarkable
for
resignation
and
its
bold
fleshy
curves
had
so
far
extended
beyond
the
limits
originally
assigned
them
that
unless
you
took
a
full
view
of
his
countenance
in
front
it
was
difficult
to
distinguish
more
than
the
extreme
tip
of
a
very
rubicund
nose
his
chin
from
the
same
cause
had
acquired
the
grave
and
imposing
form
which
is
generally
described
by
prefixing
the
word
double
to
that
expressive
feature
and
his
complexion
exhibited
that
peculiarly
mottled
combination
of
colours
which
is
only
to
be
seen
in
gentlemen
of
his
profession
and
in
underdone
roast
beef
round
his
neck
he
wore
a
crimson
which
merged
into
his
chin
by
such
imperceptible
gradations
that
it
was
difficult
to
distinguish
the
folds
of
the
one
from
the
folds
of
the
other
over
this
he
mounted
a
long
waistcoat
of
a
broad
pattern
and
over
that
again
a
skirted
green
coat
ornamented
with
large
brass
buttons
whereof
the
two
which
garnished
the
waist
were
so
far
apart
that
no
man
had
ever
beheld
them
both
at
the
same
time
his
hair
which
was
short
sleek
and
black
was
just
visible
beneath
the
capacious
brim
of
a
brown
hat
his
legs
were
encased
in
breeches
and
painted
boots
and
a
copper
terminating
in
one
seal
and
a
key
of
the
same
material
dangled
loosely
from
his
capacious
waistband
we
have
said
that
weller
was
engaged
in
preparing
for
his
journey
to
london
he
was
taking
sustenance
in
fact
on
the
table
before
him
stood
a
pot
of
ale
a
cold
round
of
beef
and
a
very
loaf
to
each
of
which
he
distributed
his
favours
in
turn
with
the
most
rigid
impartiality
he
had
just
cut
a
mighty
slice
from
the
latter
when
the
footsteps
of
somebody
entering
the
room
caused
him
to
raise
his
head
and
he
beheld
his
son
mornin
sammy
said
the
father
the
son
walked
up
to
the
pot
of
ale
and
nodding
significantly
to
his
parent
took
a
long
draught
by
way
of
reply
wery
good
power
o
suction
sammy
said
weller
the
elder
looking
into
the
pot
when
his
had
set
it
down
half
empty
you
d
ha
made
an
uncommon
fine
oyster
sammy
if
you
d
been
born
in
that
station
o
yes
i
i
should
ha
managed
to
pick
up
a

replied
sam
applying
himself
to
the
cold
beef
with
considerable
vigour
i
m
wery
sorry
sammy
said
the
elder
weller
shaking
up
the
ale
by
describing
small
circles
with
the
pot
preparatory
to
drinking
i
m
wery
sorry
sammy
to
hear
from
your
lips
as
you
let

be
gammoned
by

sammy
always
exceptin
the

imbibed

at

of

handed
it
over
to

he
instantaneously
did

with
these
affecting
words
weller
looked
steadfastly
on
his
son
and
turning
slowly
upon
his
heel
disappeared
from
his
sight
in
the
contemplative
mood
which
these
words
had
awakened
samuel
weller
walked
forth
from
the
great
white
horse
when
his
father
had
left
him
and
bending
his
steps
towards
clement
s
church
endeavoured
to
dissipate
his
melancholy
by
strolling
among
its
ancient
precincts
he
had
loitered
about
for
some
time
when
he
found
himself
in
a
retired
spot
a
kind
of
courtyard
of
venerable
appearance
which
he
discovered
had
no
other
outlet
than
the
turning
by
which
he
had
entered
he
was
about
retracing
his
steps
when
he
was
suddenly
transfixed
to
the
spot
by
a
sudden
appearance
and
the
mode
and
manner
of
this
appearance
we
now
proceed
to
relate
samuel
weller
had
been
staring
up
at
the
old
brick
houses
now
and
then
in
his
deep
abstraction
bestowing
a
wink
upon
some
looking
servant
girl
as
she
drew
up
a
blind
or
threw
open
a
bedroom
window
when
the
green
gate
of
a
garden
at
the
bottom
of
the
yard
opened
and
a
man
having
emerged
therefrom
closed
the
green
gate
very
carefully
after
him
and
walked
briskly
towards
the
very
spot
where
weller
was
standing
now
taking
this
as
an
isolated
fact
unaccompanied
by
any
attendant
circumstances
there
was
nothing
very
extraordinary
in
it
because
in
many
parts
of
the
world
men
do
come
out
of
gardens
close
green
gates
after
them
and
even
walk
briskly
away
without
attracting
any
particular
share
of
public
observation
it
is
clear
therefore
that
there
must
have
been
something
in
the
man
or
in
his
manner
or
both
to
attract
weller
s
particular
notice
whether
there
was
or
not
we
must
leave
the
reader
to
determine
when
we
have
faithfully
recorded
the
behaviour
of
the
individual
in
question
when
the
man
had
shut
the
green
gate
after
him
he
walked
as
we
have
said
twice
already
with
a
brisk
pace
up
the
courtyard
but
he
no
sooner
caught
sight
of
weller
than
he
faltered
and
stopped
as
if
uncertain
for
the
moment
what
course
to
adopt
as
the
green
gate
was
closed
behind
him
and
there
was
no
other
outlet
but
the
one
in
front
however
he
was
not
long
in
perceiving
that
he
must
pass
samuel
weller
to
get
away
he
therefore
resumed
his
brisk
pace
and
advanced
staring
straight
before
him
the
most
extraordinary
thing
about
the
man
was
that
he
was
contorting
his
face
into
the
most
fearful
and
astonishing
grimaces
that
ever
were
beheld
nature
s
handiwork
never
was
disguised
with
such
extraordinary
artificial
carving
as
the
man
had
overlaid
his
countenance
with
in
one
moment
well
said
weller
to
himself
as
the
man
approached
this
is
wery
odd
i
could
ha
swore
it
was
up
came
the
man
and
his
face
became
more
frightfully
distorted
than
ever
as
he
drew
nearer
i
could
take
my
oath
to
that
ere
black
hair
and
mulberry
suit
said
weller
only
i
never
see
such
a
face
as
that
as
weller
said
this
the
man
s
features
assumed
an
unearthly
twinge
perfectly
hideous
he
was
obliged
to
pass
very
near
sam
however
and
the
scrutinising
glance
of
that
gentleman
enabled
him
to
detect
under
all
these
appalling
twists
of
feature
something
too
like
the
small
eyes
of
job
trotter
to
be
easily
mistaken
hollo

shouted
sam
fiercely
the
stranger
stopped
hollo
repeated
sam
still
more
gruffly
the
man
with
the
horrible
face
looked
with
the
greatest
surprise
up
the
court
and
down
the
court
and
in
at
the
windows
of
the
houses
everywhere
but
at
sam
weller
and
took
another
step
forward
when
he
was
brought
to
again
by
another
shout
hollo
you
sir
said
sam
for
the
third
time
there
was
no
pretending
to
mistake
where
the
voice
came
from
now
so
the
stranger
having
no
other
resource
at
last
looked
sam
weller

in
the
face

spirit
of

address
trotter
gradually
allowed
his
face
to
resume
its
natural
expression
and
then
giving
a
start
of
joy
exclaimed

trotter
burst
into
a

arms
around
those
of

embraced
him
closely
in
an
ecstasy
of
joy

releasing

as

of
his
pugnacity
disappeared

said
sam
drily
very
very
sir
replied
trotter
without
moving
a
muscle
of
his
face
but
shake
hands
sam
eyed
his
companion
for
a
few
seconds
and
then
as
if
actuated
by
a
sudden
impulse
complied
with
his
request
how
said
job
trotter
as
they
walked
away
how
is
your
dear
good
master
oh
he
is
a
worthy
gentleman
weller
i
hope
he
didn
t
catch
cold
that
dreadful
night
there
was
a
momentary
look
of
deep
slyness
in
job
trotter
s
eye
as
he
said
this
which
ran
a
thrill
through
weller
s
clenched
fist
as
he
burned
with
a
desire
to
make
a
demonstration
on
his
ribs
sam
constrained
himself
however
and
replied
that
his
master
was
extremely
well
oh
i
am
so
glad
replied
trotter
is
he
here

asked
sam
by

sam

no

at
a
replied
job
trotter
with
the
same
sly
look
which
sam
had
noticed
before
not
at
a
at
the
house
with
the
green
gate
said
sam
eyeing
his
companion
closely
no
no
oh
not
there
replied
job
with
a
quickness
very
unusual
to
him
not
what
was
you
there
asked
sam
with
a
sharp
glance
got
inside
the
gate
by
accident
perhaps
why
weller
replied
job
i
don
t
mind
telling
you
my
little
secrets
because
you
know
we
took
such
a
fancy
for
each
other
when
we
first
met
you
recollect
how
pleasant
we
were
that
morning
oh
yes
said
sam
impatiently
i
remember
well
well
replied
job
speaking
with
great
precision
and
in
the
low
tone
of
a
man
who
communicates
an
important
secret
in
that
house
with
the
green
gate
weller
they
keep
a
good
many
so
i
should
think
from
the
look
on
it
interposed
sam
yes
continued
trotter
and
one
of
them
is
a
cook
who
has
saved
up
a
little
money
weller
and
is
desirous
if
she
can
establish
herself
in
life
to
open
a
little
shop
in
the
chandlery
way
you
yes
weller
well
sir

at
a
chapel

neat
little
chapel

where
they
sing
the
number

collection
of
hymns
which
i
generally
carry
about
with
me
in
a
little
book
which
you
may
perhaps
have
seen
in
my
hand
and
i
got
a
little
intimate
with
her
weller
and
from
that
an
acquaintance
sprung
up
between
us
and
i
may
venture
to
say
weller
that
i
am
to
be
the
ah
and
a
wery
amiable
chandler
you
ll
make
replied
sam
eyeing
job
with
a
side
look
of
intense
dislike
the
great
advantage
of
this
weller
continued
job
his
eyes
filling
with
tears
as
he
spoke
will
be
that
i
shall
be
able
to
leave
my
present
disgraceful
service
with
that
bad
man
and
to
devote
myself
to
a
better
and
more
virtuous
life
more
like
the
way
in

sam
oh
very
weller

at
the
recollection
of
the
purity
of
his
youthful
days
trotter
pulled
forth
the
pink
handkerchief
and
wept
copiously

been
an
uncommon
nice
boy

job
trotter
inserted
an
end
of
the
pink
handkerchief
into
the
corner
of
each
eye
one
after
the
other
and
began
to
weep
copiously

the
consciousness

i
can
not
keep

said
job
after
a
short
pause
to
think
that
my
master
should
have
suspected
the
conversation
i
had
with

and
so
dragged
me
away
in
a
and
after

the
sweet
young

to
his

said
pickwick
with
the
greatest
energy
where

they
sam
where
are
they
hush
hush
replied
weller
and
as
he
assisted
pickwick
to
dress
he
detailed
the
plan
of
action
on
which
he
proposed
to
enter
but
when
is
this
to
be
done
sam
inquired
pickwick
all
in
good
time
sir
replied
sam
whether
it
was
done
in
good
time
or
not

be
seen
hereafter
chapter
xxiv
wherein
peter
magnus
grows
jealous
and
the
aged
lady
apprehensive
which
brings
the
pickwickians
within
the
grasp
of
the
law
when
pickwick
descended
to
the
room
in
which
he
and
peter
magnus
had
spent
the
preceding
evening
he
found
that
gentleman
with
the
major
part
of
the
contents
of
the
two
bags
the
leathern
and
the
parcel
displaying
to
all
possible
advantage
on
his
person
while
he
himself
was
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
in
a
state
of
the
utmost
excitement
and
agitation
sir
said
peter
magnus
what
do
you
think
of
this
sir
very
effective
indeed
replied
pickwick
surveying
the
garments
of
peter
magnus
with
a
smile
yes
i
think
it
ll
do
said
magnus
mr
pickwick
sir
i
have
sent
up
my
have
you
said
pickwick
and
the
waiter
brought
back
word
that
she
would
see
me
at
eleven
at
eleven
sir
it
only
wants
a
quarter
very
near
the
time
said
pickwick
yes
it
is
rather
near
replied
magnus
rather
too
near
to
be
pleasant
eh
pickwick
sir
confidence
is
a
great
thing
in
these
cases
observed
pickwick
i
believe
it
is
sir
said
peter
magnus
i
am
very
confident
sir
really
pickwick
i
do
not
see
why
a
man
should
feel
any
fear
in
such
a
case
as
this
sir
what
is
it
sir
there
s
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
it
s
a
matter
of
mutual
accommodation
nothing
more
husband
on
one
side
wife
on
the
other
that
s
my
view
of
the
matter
it
is
a
very
philosophical
one
replied
pickwick
but
breakfast
is
waiting
magnus
down
they
sat
to
breakfast
but
it
was
evident
notwithstanding
the
boasting
of
peter
magnus
that
he
laboured
under
a
very
considerable
degree
of
nervousness
of
which
loss
of
appetite
a
propensity
to
upset
the
a
spectral
attempt
at
drollery
and
an
irresistible
inclination
to
look
at
the
clock
every
other
second
were
among
the
principal
symptoms
tittered
magnus
affecting
cheerfulness
and
gasping
with
agitation
it
only
wants
two
minutes
pickwick
am
i
pale
sir
not
very
replied
pickwick
there
was
a
brief
pause
i
beg
your
pardon
pickwick
but
have
you
ever
done
this
sort
of
thing
in
your
time
said
magnus
you
mean
proposing
said
pickwick
never
said
pickwick
with
great
energy
you
have
no
idea
then
how
it
s
best
to
begin
said
magnus
why
said
pickwick
i
may
have
formed
some
ideas
upon
the
subject
but
as
i
have
never
submitted
them
to
the
test
of
experience
i
should
be
sorry
if
you
were
induced
to
regulate
your
proceedings
by
i
should
feel
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
any
advice
sir
said
magnus
taking
another
look
at
the
clock
the
hand
of
which
was
verging
on
the
five
minutes
past
well
sir
said
pickwick
with
the
profound
solemnity
with
which
that
great
man
could
when
he
pleased
render
his
remarks
so
deeply
impressive
i
should
commence
sir
with
a
tribute
to
the
lady
s
beauty
and
excellent
qualities
from
them
sir
i
should
diverge
to
my
own
very
good
said
magnus
unworthiness
for
mind
sir
resumed
pickwick
for
to
show
that
i
was
not
wholly
unworthy
sir
i
should
take
a
brief
review
of
my
past
life
and
present
condition
i
should
argue
by
analogy
that
to
anybody
else
i
must
be
a
very
desirable
object
i
should
then
expatiate
on
the
warmth
of
my
love
and
the
depth
of
my
devotion
perhaps
i
might
then
be
tempted
to
seize
her
yes
i
see
said
magnus
that
would
be
a
very
great
i
should
then
sir
continued
pickwick
growing
warmer
as
the
subject
presented
itself
in
more
glowing
colours
before
him
i
should
then
sir
come
to
the
plain
and
simple
question
will
you
have
me
i
think
i
am
justified
in
assuming
that
upon
this
she
would
turn
away
her
you
think
that
may
be
taken
for
granted
said
magnus
because
if
she
did
not
do
that
at
the
right
place
it
would
be
i
think
she
would
said
pickwick
upon
this
sir
i
should
squeeze
her
hand
and
i
think
i
think
magnus
that
after
i
had
done
that
supposing
there
was
no
refusal
i
should
gently
draw
away
the
handkerchief
which
my
slight
knowledge
of
human
nature
leads
me
to
suppose
the
lady
would
be
applying
to
her
eyes
at
the
moment
and
steal
a
respectful
kiss
i
think
i
should
kiss
her
magnus
and
at
this
particular
point
i
am
decidedly
of
opinion
that
if
the
lady
were
going
to
take
me
at
all
she
would
murmur
into
my
ears
a
bashful
magnus
started
gazed
on
pickwick
s
intelligent
face
for
a
short
time
in
silence
and
then
the
dial
pointing
to
the
ten
minutes
past
shook
him
warmly
by
the
hand
and
rushed
desperately
from
the
room
pickwick
had
taken
a
few
strides
to
and
fro
and
the
small
hand
of
the
clock
following
the
latter
part
of
his
example
had
arrived
at
the
figure
which
indicates
the
when
the
door
suddenly
opened
he
turned
round
to
meet
peter
magnus
and
encountered
in
his
stead
the
joyous
face
of
tupman
the
serene
countenance
of
winkle
and
the
intellectual
lineaments
of
snodgrass
as
pickwick
greeted
them
peter
magnus
tripped
into
the
room
my
friends
the
gentleman
i
was
speaking
of
magnus
said
pickwick
your
servant
gentlemen
said
magnus
evidently
in
a
high
state
of
excitement
mr
pickwick
allow
me
to
speak
to
you
one
moment
as
he
said
this
magnus
harnessed
his
forefinger
to
pickwick
s
buttonhole
and
drawing
him
to
a
window
recess
said
congratulate
me
pickwick
i
followed
your
advice
to
the
very
and
it
was
all
correct
was
it
inquired
pickwick
it
was
sir
could
not
possibly
have
been
better
replied
magnus
mr
pickwick
she
is
i
congratulate
you
with
all
my
heart
replied
pickwick
warmly
shaking
his
new
friend
by
the
hand
you
must
see
her
sir
said
magnus
this
way
if
you
please
excuse
us
for
one
instant
hurrying
on
in
this
way
peter
magnus
drew
pickwick
from
the
room
he
paused
at
the
next
door
in
the
passage
and
tapped
gently
thereat
come
in
said
a
female
voice
and
in
they
went
miss
witherfield
said
magnus
allow
me
to
introduce
my
very
particular
friend
pickwick
pickwick
i
beg
to
make
you
known
to
miss
the
lady
was
at
the
upper
end
of
the
room
as
pickwick
bowed
he
took
his
spectacles
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
and
put
them
on
a
process
which
he
had
no
sooner
gone
through
than
uttering
an
exclamation
of
surprise
pickwick
retreated
several
paces
and
the
lady
with
a
scream
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
and
dropped
into
a
chair
whereupon
peter
magnus
was
stricken
motionless
on
the
spot
and
gazed
from
one
to
the
other
with
a
countenance
expressive
of
the
extremities
of
horror
and
surprise
this
certainly
was
to
all
appearance
very
unaccountable
behaviour
but
the
fact
is
that
pickwick
no
sooner
put
on
his
spectacles
than
he
at
once
recognised
in
the
future
magnus
the
lady
into
whose
room
he
had
so
unwarrantably
intruded
on
the
previous
night
and
the
spectacles
had
no
sooner
crossed
pickwick
s
nose
than
the
lady
at
once
identified
the
countenance
which
she
had
seen
surrounded
by
all
the
horrors
of
a
nightcap
so
the
lady
screamed
and
pickwick
started
mr
pickwick
exclaimed
magnus
lost
in
astonishment
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
sir
what
is
the
meaning
of
it
sir
added
magnus
in
a
threatening
and
a
louder
tone
sir
said
pickwick
somewhat
indignant
at
the
very
sudden
manner
in
which
peter
magnus
had
conjugated
himself
into
the
imperative
mood
i
decline
answering
that
you
decline
it
sir
said
magnus
i
do
sir
replied
pickwick
i
object
to
say
anything
which
may
compromise
that
lady
or
awaken
unpleasant
recollections
in
her
breast
without
her
consent
and
miss
witherfield
said
peter
magnus
do
you
know
this
person
know
him
repeated
the
lady
hesitating
yes
know
him
ma
am
i
said
know
him
replied
magnus
with
ferocity
i
have
seen
him
replied
the
lady
where
inquired
magnus
where
that
said
the
lady
rising
from
her
seat
and
averting
her
head
that
i
would
not
reveal
for
i
understand
you
ma
am
said
pickwick
and
respect
your
delicacy
it
shall
never
be
revealed
by
depend
upon
upon
my
word
ma
am
said
magnus
considering
the
situation
in
which
i
am
placed
with
regard
to
yourself
you
carry
this
matter
off
with
tolerable
coolness
tolerable
coolness
ma
cruel
magnus
said
the
lady
here
she
wept
very
copiously
indeed
address
your
observations
to
me
sir
interposed
pickwick
i
alone
am
to
blame
if
anybody
oh
you
alone
are
to
blame
are
you
sir
said
magnus
i
i
see
through
this
sir
you
repent
of
your
determination
now
do
you
my
determination
said
pickwick
your
determination
sir
oh
don
t
stare
at
me
sir
said
magnus
i
recollect
your
words
last
night
sir
you
came
down
here
sir
to
expose
the
treachery
and
falsehood
of
an
individual
on
whose
truth
and
honour
you
had
placed
implicit
reliance
eh
here
peter
magnus
indulged
in
a
prolonged
sneer
and
taking
off
his
green
spectacles
which
he
probably
found
superfluous
in
his
fit
of
jealousy
rolled
his
little
eyes
about
in
a
manner
frightful
to
behold
eh
said
magnus
and
then
he
repeated
the
sneer
with
increased
effect
but
you
shall
answer
it
answer
what
said
pickwick
never
mind
sir
replied
magnus
striding
up
and
down
the
room
never
there
must
be
something
very
comprehensive
in
this
phrase
of
never
mind
for
we
do
not
recollect
to
have
ever
witnessed
a
quarrel
in
the
street
at
a
theatre
public
room
or
elsewhere
in
which
it
has
not
been
the
standard
reply
to
all
belligerent
inquiries
do
you
call
yourself
a
gentleman
sir
never
mind
did
i
offer
to
say
anything
to
the
young
woman
sir
never
mind
do
you
want
your
head
knocked
up
against
that
wall
sir
never
mind
it
is
observable
too
that
there
would
appear
to
be
some
hidden
taunt
in
this
universal
never
mind
which
rouses
more
indignation
in
the
bosom
of
the
individual
addressed
than
the
most
lavish
abuse
could
possibly
awaken
we
do
not
mean
to
assert
that
the
application
of
this
brevity
to
himself
struck
exactly
that
indignation
to
pickwick
s
soul
which
it
would
infallibly
have
roused
in
a
vulgar
breast
we
merely
record
the
fact
that
pickwick
opened
the
room
door
and
abruptly
called
out
tupman
come
here
tupman
immediately
presented
himself
with
a
look
of
very
considerable
surprise
tupman
said
pickwick
a
secret
of
some
delicacy
in
which
that
lady
is
concerned
is
the
cause
of
a
difference
which
has
just
arisen
between
this
gentleman
and
myself
when
i
assure
him
in
your
presence
that
it
has
no
relation
to
himself
and
is
not
in
any
way
connected
with
his
affairs
i
need
hardly
beg
you
to
take
notice
that
if
he
continue
to
dispute
it
he
expresses
a
doubt
of
my
veracity
which
i
shall
consider
extremely
as
pickwick
said
this
he
looked
encyclopedias
at
peter
magnus
pickwick
s
upright
and
honourable
bearing
coupled
with
that
force
and
energy
of
speech
which
so
eminently
distinguished
him
would
have
carried
conviction
to
any
reasonable
mind
but
unfortunately
at
that
particular
moment
the
mind
of
peter
magnus
was
in
anything
but
reasonable
order
consequently
instead
of
receiving
pickwick
s
explanation
as
he
ought
to
have
done
he
forthwith
proceeded
to
work
himself
into
a
scorching
consuming
passion
and
to
talk
about
what
was
due
to
his
own
feelings
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
adding
force
to
his
declamation
by
striding
to
and
fro
and
pulling
his
hair
amusements
which
he
would
vary
occasionally
by
shaking
his
fist
in
pickwick
s
philanthropic
countenance
pickwick
in
his
turn
conscious
of
his
own
innocence
and
rectitude
and
irritated
by
having
unfortunately
involved
the
lady
in
such
an
unpleasant
affair
was
not
so
quietly
disposed
as
was
his
wont
the
consequence
was
that
words
ran
high
and
voices
higher
and
at
length
magnus
told
pickwick
he
should
hear
from
him
to
which
pickwick
replied
with
laudable
politeness
that
the
sooner
he
heard
from
him
the
better
whereupon
the
lady
rushed
in
terror
from
the
room
out
of
which
tupman
dragged
pickwick
leaving
peter
magnus
to
himself
and
meditation
if
the
lady
had
mingled
much
with
the
busy
world
or
had
profited
at
all
by
the
manners
and
customs
of
those
who
make
the
laws
and
set
the
fashions
she
would
have
known
that
this
sort
of
ferocity
is
the
most
harmless
thing
in
nature
but
as
she
had
lived
for
the
most
part
in
the
country
and
never
read
the
parliamentary
debates
she
was
little
versed
in
these
particular
refinements
of
civilised
life
accordingly
when
she
had
gained
her
bedchamber
bolted
herself
in
and
began
to
meditate
on
the
scene
she
had
just
witnessed
the
most
terrific
pictures
of
slaughter
and
destruction
presented
themselves
to
her
imagination
among
which
a
portrait
of
peter
magnus
borne
home
by
four
men
with
the
embellishment
of
a
whole
barrelful
of
bullets
in
his
left
side
was
among
the
very
least
the
more
the
aged
lady
meditated
the
more
terrified
she
became
and
at
length
she
determined
to
repair
to
the
house
of
the
principal
magistrate
of
the
town
and
request
him
to
secure
the
persons
of
pickwick
and
tupman
without
delay
to
this
decision
the
lady
was
impelled
by
a
variety
of
considerations
the
chief
of
which
was
the
incontestable
proof
it
would
afford
of
her
devotion
to
peter
magnus
and
her
anxiety
for
his
safety
she
was
too
well
acquainted
with
his
jealous
temperament
to
venture
the
slightest
allusion
to
the
real
cause
of
her
agitation
on
beholding
pickwick
and
she
trusted
to
her
own
influence
and
power
of
persuasion
with
the
little
man
to
quell
his
boisterous
jealousy
supposing
that
pickwick
were
removed
and
no
fresh
quarrel
could
arise
filled
with
these
reflections
the
lady
arrayed
herself
in
her
bonnet
and
shawl
and
repaired
to
the
mayor
s
dwelling
straightway
now
george
nupkins
esquire
the
principal
magistrate
aforesaid
was
as
grand
a
personage
as
the
fastest
walker
would
find
out
between
sunrise
and
sunset
on
the
of
june
which
being
according
to
the
almanacs
the
longest
day
in
the
whole
year
would
naturally
afford
him
the
longest
period
for
his
search
on
this
particular
morning
nupkins
was
in
a
state
of
the
utmost
excitement
and
irritation
for
there
had
been
a
rebellion
in
the
town
all
the
at
the
largest
had
conspired
to
break
the
windows
of
an
obnoxious
and
had
hooted
the
beadle
and
pelted
the
constabulary
an
elderly
gentleman
in
who
had
been
called
out
to
repress
the
tumult
and
who
had
been
a
man
and
boy
for
half
a
century
at
least
and
nupkins
was
sitting
in
his
frowning
with
majesty
and
boiling
with
rage
when
a
lady
was
announced
on
pressing
private
and
particular
business
nupkins
looked
calmly
terrible
and
commanded
that
the
lady
should
be
shown
in
which
command
like
all
the
mandates
of
emperors
and
magistrates
and
other
great
potentates
of
the
earth
was
forthwith
obeyed
and
miss
witherfield
interestingly
agitated
was
ushered
in
accordingly
muzzle
said
the
magistrate
muzzle
was
an
undersized
footman
with
a
long
body
and
short
legs
muzzle
yes
your
place
a
chair
and
leave
the
yes
your
now
ma
am
will
you
state
your
business
said
the
magistrate
it
is
of
a
very
painful
kind
sir
said
miss
witherfield
very
likely
ma
am
said
the
magistrate
compose
your
feelings
ma
here
nupkins
looked
benignant
and
then
tell
me
what
legal
business
brings
you
here
ma
here
the
magistrate
triumphed
over
the
man
and
he
looked
stern
again
it
is
very
distressing
to
me
sir
to
give
this
information
said
miss
witherfield
but
i
fear
a
duel
is
going
to
be
fought
here
ma
am
said
the
magistrate
where
ma
am
in
in
ipswich
ma
am
a
duel
in
ipswich
said
the
magistrate
perfectly
aghast
at
the
notion
impossible
ma
am
nothing
of
the
kind
can
be
contemplated
in
this
town
i
am
persuaded
bless
my
soul
ma
am
are
you
aware
of
the
activity
of
our
local
magistracy
do
you
happen
to
have
heard
ma
am
that
i
rushed
into
a
on
the
fourth
of
may
last
attended
by
only
sixty
special
constables
and
at
the
hazard
of
falling
a
sacrifice
to
the
angry
passions
of
an
infuriated
multitude
prohibited
a
pugilistic
contest
between
the
middlesex
dumpling
and
the
suffolk
bantam
a
duel
in
ipswich
ma
am
i
don
t
think
i
do
not
think
said
the
magistrate
reasoning
with
himself
that
any
two
men
can
have
had
the
hardihood
to
plan
such
a
breach
of
the
peace
in
this
my
information
is
unfortunately
but
too
correct
said
the
aged
lady
i
was
present
at
the
it
s
a
most
extraordinary
thing
said
the
astounded
magistrate
muzzle
yes
your
send
jinks
here
directly
yes
your
muzzle
retired
and
a
pale
clerk
of
middle
age
entered
the
room
mr
jinks
said
the
magistrate
mr
sir
said
jinks
this
lady
jinks
has
come
here
to
give
information
of
an
intended
duel
in
this
jinks
not
knowing
exactly
what
to
do
smiled
a
dependent
s
smile
what
are
you
laughing
at
jinks
said
the
magistrate
jinks
looked
serious
instantly
mr
jinks
said
the
magistrate
you
re
a
jinks
looked
humbly
at
the
great
man
and
bit
the
top
of
his
pen
you
may
see
something
very
comical
in
this
information
sir
but
i
can
tell
you
this
jinks
that
you
have
very
little
to
laugh
at
said
the
magistrate
the
jinks
sighed
as
if
he
were
quite
aware
of
the
fact
of
his
having
very
little
indeed
to
be
merry
about
and
being
ordered
to
take
the
lady
s
information
shambled
to
a
seat
and
proceeded
to
write
it
down
this
man
pickwick
is
the
principal
i
understand
said
the
magistrate
when
the
statement
was
finished
he
is
said
the
lady
and
the
other
rioter
what
s
his
name
jinks
tupman
tupman
is
the
second
the
other
principal
you
say
has
absconded
ma
am
yes
replied
miss
witherfield
with
a
short
cough
very
well
said
the
magistrate
these
are
two
from
london
who
have
come
down
here
to
destroy
his
majesty
s
population
thinking
that
at
this
distance
from
the
capital
the
arm
of
the
law
is
weak
and
paralysed
they
shall
be
made
an
example
of
draw
up
the
warrants
jinks
muzzle
yes
your
is
grummer
downstairs
yes
your
send
him
the
obsequious
muzzle
retired
and
presently
returned
introducing
the
elderly
gentleman
in
the
who
was
chiefly
remarkable
for
a
a
hoarse
voice
a
surtout
and
a
wandering
eye
grummer
said
the
magistrate
your
is
the
town
quiet
now
pretty
well
your
replied
grummer
pop
lar
feeling
has
in
a
measure
subsided
consekens
o
the
boys
having
dispersed
to
nothing
but
vigorous
measures
will
do
in
these
times
grummer
said
the
magistrate
in
a
determined
manner
if
the
authority
of
the
king
s
officers
is
set
at
naught
we
must
have
the
riot
act
read
if
the
civil
power
can
not
protect
these
windows
grummer
the
military
must
protect
the
civil
power
and
the
windows
too
i
believe
that
is
a
maxim
of
the
constitution
jinks
certainly
sir
said
jinks
very
good
said
the
magistrate
signing
the
warrants
grummer
you
will
bring
these
persons
before
me
this
afternoon
you
will
find
them
at
the
great
white
horse
you
recollect
the
case
of
the
middlesex
dumpling
and
the
suffolk
bantam
grummer
grummer
intimated
by
a
retrospective
shake
of
the
head
that
he
should
never
forget
it
as
indeed
it
was
not
likely
he
would
so
long
as
it
continued
to
be
cited
daily
this
is
even
more
unconstitutional
said
the
magistrate
this
is
even
a
greater
breach
of
the
peace
and
a
grosser
infringement
of
his
majesty
s
prerogative
i
believe
duelling
is
one
of
his
majesty
s
most
undoubted
prerogatives
jinks
expressly
stipulated
in
magna
charta
sir
said
jinks
one
of
the
brightest
jewels
in
the
british
crown
wrung
from
his
majesty
by
the
barons
i
believe
jinks
said
the
magistrate
just
so
sir
replied
jinks
very
well
said
the
magistrate
drawing
himself
up
proudly
it
shall
not
be
violated
in
this
portion
of
his
dominions
grummer
procure
assistance
and
execute
these
warrants
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
muzzle
yes
your
show
the
lady
miss
witherfield
retired
deeply
impressed
with
the
magistrate
s
learning
and
research
nupkins
retired
to
lunch
jinks
retired
within
himself
that
being
the
only
retirement
he
had
except
the
bedstead
in
the
small
parlour
which
was
occupied
by
his
landlady
s
family
in
the
daytime
and
grummer
retired
to
wipe
out
by
his
mode
of
discharging
his
present
commission
the
insult
which
had
been
fastened
upon
himself
and
the
other
representative
of
his
majesty
the
beadle
in
the
course
of
the
morning
while
these
resolute
and
determined
preparations
for
the
conservation
of
the
king
s
peace
were
pending
pickwick
and
his
friends
wholly
unconscious
of
the
mighty
events
in
progress
had
sat
quietly
down
to
dinner
and
very
talkative
and
companionable
they
all
were
pickwick
was
in
the
very
act
of
relating
his
adventure
of
the
preceding
night
to
the
great
amusement
of
his
followers
tupman
especially
when
the
door
opened
and
a
somewhat
forbidding
countenance
peeped
into
the
room
the
eyes
in
the
forbidding
countenance
looked
very
earnestly
at
pickwick
for
several
seconds
and
were
to
all
appearance
satisfied
with
their
investigation
for
the
body
to
which
the
forbidding
countenance
belonged
slowly
brought
itself
into
the
apartment
and
presented
the
form
of
an
elderly
individual
in
not
to
keep
the
reader
any
longer
in
suspense
in
short
the
eyes
were
the
wandering
eyes
of
grummer
and
the
body
was
the
body
of
the
same
gentleman
grummer
s
mode
of
proceeding
was
professional
but
peculiar
his
first
act
was
to
bolt
the
door
on
the
inside
his
second
to
polish
his
head
and
countenance
very
carefully
with
a
cotton
handkerchief
his
third
to
place
his
hat
with
the
cotton
handkerchief
in
it
on
the
nearest
chair
and
his
fourth
to
produce
from
the
of
his
coat
a
short
truncheon
surmounted
by
a
brazen
crown
with
which
he
beckoned
to
pickwick
with
a
grave
and
air
snodgrass
was
the
first
to
break
the
astonished
silence
he
looked
steadily
at
grummer
for
a
brief
space
and
then
said
emphatically
this
is
a
private
room
sir
a
private
grummer
shook
his
head
and
replied
no
room
s
private
to
his
majesty
when
the
street
door
s
once
passed
that
s
law
some
people
maintains
that
an
englishman
s
house
is
his
castle
that
s
the
pickwickians
gazed
on
each
other
with
wondering
eyes
which
is
tupman
inquired
grummer
he
had
an
intuitive
perception
of
pickwick
he
knew
him
at
once
my
name
s
tupman
said
that
gentleman
my
name
s
law
said
grummer
what
said
tupman

a

something

the

what
is
the
meaning
of

atrocious
intrusion
upon

said
pickwick
who

said
tupman
what
do

scoundrels
said
snodgrass
winkle
said
nothing
but
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
grummer
and
bestowed
a
look
upon
him
which
if
he
had
had
any
feeling
must
have
pierced
his
brain
as
it
was
however
it
had
no
visible
effect
on
him
whatever
when
the
executive
perceived
that
pickwick
and
his
friends
were
disposed
to
resist
the
authority
of
the
law
they
very
significantly
turned
up
their
coat
sleeves
as
if
knocking
them
down
in
the
first
instance
and
taking
them
up
afterwards
were
a
mere
professional
act
which
had
only
to
be
thought
of
to
be
done
as
a
matter
of
course
this
demonstration
was
not
lost
upon
pickwick
he
conferred
a
few
moments
with
tupman
apart
and
then
signified
his
readiness
to
proceed
to
the
mayor
s
residence
merely
begging
the
parties
then
and
there
assembled
to
take
notice
that
it
was
his
firm
intention
to
resent
this
monstrous
invasion
of
his
privileges
as
an
englishman
the
instant
he
was
at
liberty
whereat
the
parties
then
and
there
assembled
laughed
very
heartily
with
the
single
exception
of
grummer
who
seemed
to
consider
that
any
slight
cast
upon
the
divine
right
of
magistrates
was
a
species
of
blasphemy
not
to
be
tolerated
but
when
pickwick
had
signified
his
readiness
to
bow
to
the
laws
of
his
country
and
just
when
the
waiters
and
hostlers
and
chambermaids
and
who
had
anticipated
a
delightful
commotion
from
his
threatened
obstinacy
began
to
turn
away
disappointed
and
disgusted
a
difficulty
arose
which
had
not
been
foreseen
with
every
sentiment
of
veneration
for
the
constituted
authorities
pickwick
resolutely
protested
against
making
his
appearance
in
the
public
streets
surrounded
and
guarded
by
the
officers
of
justice
like
a
common
criminal
grummer
in
the
then
disturbed
state
of
public
feeling
for
it
was
and
the
boys
had
not
yet
gone
home
as
resolutely
protested
against
walking
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
and
taking
pickwick
s
parole
that
he
would
go
straight
to
the
magistrate
s
and
both
pickwick
and
tupman
as
strenuously
objected
to
the
expense
of
a
which
was
the
only
respectable
conveyance
that
could
be
obtained
the
dispute
ran
high
and
the
dilemma
lasted
long
and
just
as
the
executive
were
on
the
point
of
overcoming
pickwick
s
objection
to
walking
to
the
magistrate
s
by
the
trite
expedient
of
carrying
him
thither
it
was
recollected
that
there
stood
in
the
inn
yard
an
old
which
having
been
originally
built
for
a
gouty
gentleman
with
funded
property
would
hold
pickwick
and
tupman
at
least
as
conveniently
as
a
modern
the
chair
was
hired
and
brought
into
the
hall
pickwick
and
tupman
squeezed
themselves
inside
and
pulled
down
the
blinds
a
couple
of
chairmen
were
speedily
found
and
the
procession
started
in
grand
order
the
specials
surrounded
the
body
of
the
vehicle
grummer
and
dubbley
marched
triumphantly
in
front
snodgrass
and
winkle
walked
behind
and
the
unsoaped
of
ipswich
brought
up
the
rear
the
shopkeepers
of
the
town
although
they
had
a
very
indistinct
notion
of
the
nature
of
the
offence
could
not
but
be
much
edified
and
gratified
by
this
spectacle
here
was
the
strong
arm
of
the
law
coming
down
with
twenty
force
upon
two
offenders
from
the
metropolis
itself
the
mighty
engine
was
directed
by
their
own
magistrate
and
worked
by
their
own
officers
and
both
the
criminals
by
their
united
efforts
were
securely
shut
up
in
the
narrow
compass
of
one
many
were
the
expressions
of
approval
and
admiration
which
greeted
grummer
as
he
headed
the
cavalcade
staff
in
hand
loud
and
long
were
the
shouts
raised
by
the
unsoaped
and
amidst
these
united
testimonials
of
public
approbation
the
procession
moved
slowly
and
majestically
along
weller
habited
in
his
morning
jacket
with
the
black
calico
sleeves
was
returning
in
a
rather
desponding
state
from
an
unsuccessful
survey
of
the
mysterious
house
with
the
green
gate
when
raising
his
eyes
he
beheld
a
crowd
pouring
down
the
street
surrounding
an
object
which
had
very
much
the
appearance
of
a
willing
to
divert
his
thoughts
from
the
failure
of
his
enterprise
he
stepped
aside
to
see
the
crowd
pass
and
finding
that
they
were
cheering
away
very
much
to
their
own
satisfaction
forthwith
began
by
way
of
raising
his
spirits
to
cheer
too
with
all
his
might
and
main
grummer
passed
and
dubbley
passed
and
the
sedan
passed
and
the
bodyguard
of
specials
passed
and
sam
was
still
responding
to
the
enthusiastic
cheers
of
the
mob
and
waving
his
hat
about
as
if
he
were
in
the
very
last
extreme
of
the
wildest
joy
though
of
course
he
had
not
the
faintest
idea
of
the
matter
in
hand
when
he
was
suddenly
stopped
by
the
unexpected
appearance
of
winkle
and
snodgrass
what
s
the
row
gen
l
m
n
cried
sam
who
have
they
got
in
this
here
in
mournin
both
gentlemen
replied
together
but
their
words
were
lost
in
the
tumult
who
is
it
cried
sam
again
once
more
was
a
joint
reply
returned
and
though
the
words
were
inaudible
sam
saw
by
the
motion
of
the
two
pairs
of
lips
that
they
had
uttered
the
magic
word
this
was
enough
in
another
minute
weller
had
made
his
way
through
the
crowd
stopped
the
chairmen
and
confronted
the
portly
grummer
hollo
old
gen
l
m
n
said
sam
who
have
you
got
in
this
here
conweyance
stand
back
said
grummer
whose
dignity
like
the
dignity
of
a
great
many
other
men
had
been
wondrously
augmented
by
a
little
popularity
knock
him
down
if
he
don
t
said
dubbley
i
m
wery
much
obliged
to
you
old
gen
l
m
n
replied
sam
for
consulting
my
conwenience
and
i
m
still
more
obliged
to
the
other
gen
l
m
n
who
looks
as
if
he
d
just
escaped
from
a
giant
s
carrywan
for
his
wery
andsome
suggestion
but
i
should
prefer
your
givin
me
a
answer
to
my
question
if
it
s
all
the
same
to
how
are
you
sir
this
last
observation
was
addressed
with
a
patronising
air
to
pickwick
who
was
peeping
through
the
front
window
grummer
perfectly
speechless
with
indignation
dragged
the
truncheon
with
the
brass
crown
from
its
particular
pocket
and
flourished
it
before
sam
s
eyes
ah
said
sam
it
s
wery
pretty
specially
the
crown
which
is
uncommon
like
the
real
stand
back
said
the
outraged
grummer
by
way
of
adding
force
to
the
command
he
thrust
the
brass
emblem
of
royalty
into
sam
s
neckcloth
with
one
hand
and
seized
sam
s
collar
with
the
other
a
compliment
which
weller
returned
by
knocking
him
down
out
of
hand
having
previously
with
the
utmost
consideration
knocked
down
a
chairman
for
him
to
lie
upon
whether
winkle
was
seized
with
a
temporary
attack
of
that
species
of
insanity
which
originates
in
a
sense
of
injury
or
animated
by
this
display
of
weller
s
valour
is
uncertain
but
certain
it
is
that
he
no
sooner
saw
grummer
fall
than
he
made
a
terrific
onslaught
on
a
small
boy
who
stood
next
him
whereupon
snodgrass
in
a
truly
christian
spirit
and
in
order
that
he
might
take
no
one
unawares
announced
in
a
very
loud
tone
that
he
was
going
to
begin
and
proceeded
to
take
off
his
coat
with
the
utmost
deliberation
he
was
immediately
surrounded
and
secured
and
it
is
but
common
justice
both
to
him
and
winkle
to
say
that
they
did
not
make
the
slightest
attempt
to
rescue
either
themselves
or
weller
who
after
a
most
vigorous
resistance
was
overpowered
by
numbers
and
taken
prisoner
the
procession
then
reformed
the
chairmen
resumed
their
stations
and
the
march
was
commenced
pickwick
s
indignation
during
the
whole
of
this
proceeding
was
beyond
all
bounds
he
could
just
see
sam
upsetting
the
specials
and
flying
about
in
every
direction
and
that
was
all
he
could
see
for
the
sedan
doors
wouldn
t
open
and
the
blinds
wouldn
t
pull
up
at
length
with
the
assistance
of
tupman
he
managed
to
push
open
the
roof
and
mounting
on
the
seat
and
steadying
himself
as
well
as
he
could
by
placing
his
hand
on
that
gentleman
s
shoulder
pickwick
proceeded
to
address
the
multitude
to
dwell
upon
the
unjustifiable
manner
in
which
he
had
been
treated
and
to
call
upon
them
to
take
notice
that
his
servant
had
been
first
assaulted
in
this
order
they
reached
the
magistrate
s
house
the
chairmen
trotting
the
prisoners
following
pickwick
oratorising
and
the
crowd
shouting
chapter
xxv
showing
among
a
variety
of
pleasant
matters
how
majestic
and
impartial
nupkins
was
and
how
weller
returned

as
heavily
as
it
came
with
another
matter
which
will
be
found
in
its
place
violent
was
weller
s
indignation
as
he
was
borne
along
numerous
were
the
allusions
to
the
personal
appearance
and
demeanour
of
grummer
and
his
companion
and
valorous
were
the
defiances
to
any
six
of
the
gentlemen
present
in
which
he
vented
his
dissatisfaction
snodgrass
and
winkle
listened
with
gloomy
respect
to
the
torrent
of
eloquence
which
their
leader
poured
forth
from
the
and
the
rapid
course
of
which
not
all
tupman
s
earnest
entreaties
to
have
the
lid
of
the
vehicle
closed
were
able
to
check
for
an
instant
but
weller
s
anger
quickly
gave
way
to
curiosity
when
the
procession
turned
down
the
identical
courtyard
in
which
he
had
met
with
the
runaway
job
trotter
and
curiosity
was
exchanged
for
a
feeling
of
the
most
gleeful
astonishment
when
the
grummer
commanding
the
to
halt
advanced
with
dignified
and
portentous
steps
to
the
very
green
gate
from
which
job
trotter
had
emerged
and
gave
a
mighty
pull
at
the
which
hung
at
the
side
thereof
the
ring
was
answered
by
a
very
smart
and
who
after
holding
up
her
hands
in
astonishment
at
the
rebellious
appearance
of
the
prisoners
and
the
impassioned
language
of
pickwick
summoned
muzzle
muzzle
opened
one
half
of
the
carriage
gate
to
admit
the
sedan
the
captured
ones
and
the
specials
and
immediately
slammed
it
in
the
faces
of
the
mob
who
indignant
at
being
excluded
and
anxious
to
see
what
followed
relieved
their
feelings
by
kicking
at
the
gate
and
ringing
the
bell
for
an
hour
or
two
afterwards
in
this
amusement
they
all
took
part
by
turns
except
three
or
four
fortunate
individuals
who
having
discovered
a
grating
in
the
gate
which
commanded
a
view
of
nothing
stared
through
it
with
the
indefatigable
perseverance
with
which
people
will
flatten
their
noses
against
the
front
windows
of
a
chemist
s
shop
when
a
drunken
man
who
has
been
run
over
by
a
in
the
street
is
undergoing
a
surgical
inspection
in
the
at
the
foot
of
a
flight
of
steps
leading
to
the
house
door
which
was
guarded
on
either
side
by
an
american
aloe
in
a
green
tub
the
chair
stopped
pickwick
and
his
friends
were
conducted
into
the
hall
whence
having
been
previously
announced
by
muzzle
and
ordered
in
by
nupkins
they
were
ushered
into
the
worshipful
presence
of
that
officer
the
scene
was
an
impressive
one
well
calculated
to
strike
terror
to
the
hearts
of
culprits
and
to
impress
them
with
an
adequate
idea
of
the
stern
majesty
of
the
law
in
front
of
a
big
in
a
big
chair
behind
a
big
table
and
before
a
big
volume
sat
nupkins
looking
a
full
size
larger
than
any
one
of
them
big
as
they
were
the
table
was
adorned
with
piles
of
papers
and
above
the
farther
end
of
it
appeared
the
head
and
shoulders
of
jinks
who
was
busily
engaged
in
looking
as
busy
as
possible
the
party
having
all
entered
muzzle
carefully
closed
the
door
and
placed
himself
behind
his
master
s
chair
to
await
his
orders
nupkins
threw
himself
back
with
thrilling
solemnity
and
scrutinised
the
faces
of
his
unwilling
visitors
now
grummer
who
is
that
person
said
nupkins
pointing
to
pickwick

as

nupkins

wery
impartial
country
for
justice
said
there
ain
t
a
magistrate
goin
as
don
t
commit
himself
twice
as
he
commits
other
at
this
sally
another
special
laughed
and
then
tried
to
look
so
supernaturally
solemn
that
the
magistrate
detected
him
immediately
grummer
said
nupkins
reddening
with
passion
how
dare
you
select
such
an
inefficient
and
disreputable
person
for
a
special
constable
as
that
man
how
dare
you
do
it
sir
i
am
very
sorry
your
stammered
grummer
very
sorry
said
the
furious
magistrate
you
shall
repent
of
this
neglect
of
duty
grummer

shall
be
made
an
example
of
take
that
fellow
s
staff
away

s
drunk

re

worship
said
the
man
you
returned
the
magistrate
how
dare
you
say
you
are
not
drunk
sir
when
i
say
you
are
doesn
t
he
smell
of
spirits
grummer
horrid
your
replied
grummer
who
had
a
vague
impression
that
there
was
a
smell
of
rum
somewhere
i
knew
he
did
said
nupkins
i
saw
he
was
drunk
when
he
first
came
into
the
room
by
his
excited
eye
did
you
observe
his
excited
eye
jinks
certainly
i
haven
t
touched
a
drop
of
spirits
this
morning
said
the
man
who
was
as
sober
a
fellow
as
need
be
how
dare
you
tell
me
a
falsehood
said
nupkins
isn
t
he
drunk
at
this
moment
jinks
certainly
sir
replied
jinks
mr
jinks
said
the
magistrate
i
shall
commit
that
man
for
contempt
make
out
his
committal
and
committed
the
special
would
have
been
only
jinks
who
was
the
magistrate
s
adviser
having
had
a
legal
education
of
three
years
in
a
country
attorney
s
office
whispered
the
magistrate
that
he
thought
it
wouldn
t
do
so
the
magistrate
made
a
speech
and
said
that
in
consideration
of
the
special
s
family
he
would
merely
reprimand
and
discharge
him
accordingly
the
special
was
abused
vehemently
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
sent
about
his
business
and
grummer
dubbley
muzzle
and
all
the
other
specials
murmured
their
admiration
of
the
magnanimity
of
nupkins
now
jinks
said
the
magistrate
swear
grummer
was
sworn
directly
but
as
grummer
wandered
and
nupkins
s
dinner
was
nearly
ready
nupkins
cut
the
matter
short
by
putting
leading
questions
to
grummer
which
grummer
answered
as
nearly
in
the
affirmative
as
he
could
so
the
examination
went
off
all
very
smooth
and
comfortable
and
two
assaults
were
proved
against
weller
and
a
threat
against
winkle
and
a
push
against
snodgrass
when
all
this
was
done
to
the
magistrate
s
satisfaction
the
magistrate
and
jinks
consulted
in
whispers
the
consultation
having
lasted
about
ten
minutes
jinks
retired
to
his
end
of
the
table
and
the
magistrate
with
a
preparatory
cough
drew
himself
up
in
his
chair
and
was
proceeding
to
commence
his
address
when
pickwick
interposed
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
for
interrupting
you
said
pickwick
but
before
you
proceed
to
express
and
act
upon
any
opinion
you
may
have
formed
on
the
statements
which
have
been
made
here
i
must
claim
my
right
to
be
heard
so
far
as
i
am
personally
hold
your
tongue
sir
said
the
magistrate
peremptorily
i
must
submit
to
you
sir
said
pickwick
hold
your
tongue
sir
interposed
the
magistrate
or
i
shall
order
an
officer
to
remove
you
may
order
your
officers
to
do
whatever
you
please
sir
said
pickwick
and
i
have
no
doubt
from
the
specimen
i
have
had
of
the
subordination
preserved
amongst
them
that
whatever
you
order
they
will
execute
sir
but
i
shall
take
the
liberty
sir
of
claiming
my
right
to
be
heard
until
i
am
removed
by
pickvick
and
principle
exclaimed
weller
in
a
very
audible
voice
sam
be
quiet
said
pickwick
dumb
as
a
drum
vith
a
hole
in
it
sir
replied
sam
nupkins
looked
at
pickwick
with
a
gaze
of
intense
astonishment
at
his
displaying
such
unwonted
temerity
and
was
apparently
about
to
return
a
very
angry
reply
when
jinks
pulled
him
by
the
sleeve
and
whispered
something
in
his
ear
to
this
the
magistrate
returned
a
audible
answer
and
then
the
whispering
was
renewed
jinks
was
evidently
remonstrating
at
length
the
magistrate
gulping
down
with
a
very
bad
grace
his
disinclination
to
hear
anything
more
turned
to
pickwick
and
said
sharply
what
do
you
want
to
say
first
said
pickwick
sending
a
look
through
his
spectacles
under
which
even
nupkins
quailed
first
i
wish
to
know
what
i
and
my
friend
have
been
brought
here
for
must
i
tell
him
whispered
the
magistrate
to
jinks
i
think
you
had
better
sir
whispered
jinks
to
the
magistrate
an
information
has
been
sworn
before
me
said
the
magistrate
that
it
is
apprehended
you
are
going
to
fight
a
duel
and
that
the
other
man
tupman
is
your
aider
and
abettor
in
it
therefore
eh
jinks
certainly
therefore
i
call
upon
you
both
to
i
think
that
s
the
course
jinks
certainly
to
to
what
jinks
said
the
magistrate
pettishly
to
find
bail
yes
therefore
i
call
upon
you
both
as
i
was
about
to
say
when
i
was
interrupted
by
my
clerk
to
find
good
bail
whispered
jinks
i
shall
require
good
bail
said
the
magistrate
town
whispered
jinks
they
must
be
townspeople
said
the
magistrate
fifty
pounds
each
whispered
jinks
and
householders
of
i
shall
require
two
sureties
of
fifty
pounds
each
said
the
magistrate
aloud
with
great
dignity
and
they
must
be
householders
of
but
bless
my
heart
sir
said
pickwick
who
together
with
tupman
was
all
amazement
and
indignation
we
are
perfect
strangers
in
this
town
i
have
as
little
knowledge
of
any
householders
here
as
i
have
intention
of
fighting
a
duel
with
i
dare
say
replied
the
magistrate
i
dare
say
don
t
you
jinks
certainly
have
you
anything
more
to
say
inquired
the
magistrate
pickwick
had
a
great
deal
more
to
say
which
he
would
no
doubt
have
said
very
little
to
his
own
advantage
or
the
magistrate
s
satisfaction
if
he
had
not
the
moment
he
ceased
speaking
been
pulled
by
the
sleeve
by
weller
with
whom
he
was
immediately
engaged
in
so
earnest
a
conversation
that
he
suffered
the
magistrate
s
inquiry
to
pass
wholly
unnoticed
nupkins
was
not
the
man
to
ask
a
question
of
the
kind
twice
over
and
so
with
another
preparatory
cough
he
proceeded
amidst
the
reverential
and
admiring
silence
of
the
constables
to
pronounce
his
decision
he
should
fine
weller
two
pounds
for
the
first
assault
and
three
pounds
for
the
second
he
should
fine
winkle
two
pounds
and
snodgrass
one
pound
besides
requiring
them
to
enter
into
their
own
recognisances
to
keep
the
peace
towards
all
his
majesty
s
subjects
and
especially
towards
his
liege
servant
daniel
grummer
pickwick
and
tupman
he
had
already
held
to
bail
immediately
on
the
magistrate
ceasing
to
speak
pickwick
with
a
smile
mantling
on
his
again
countenance
stepped
forward
and
said
i
beg
the
magistrate
s
pardon
but
may
i
request
a
few
minutes
private
conversation
with
him
on
a
matter
of
deep
importance
to
himself
what
said
the
magistrate
pickwick
repeated
his
request
this
is
a
most
extraordinary
request
said
the
magistrate
a
private
interview
a
private
interview
replied
pickwick
firmly
only
as
a
part
of
the
information
which
i
wish
to
communicate
is
derived
from
my
servant
i
should
wish
him
to
be
the
magistrate
looked
at
jinks
jinks
looked
at
the
magistrate
the
officers
looked
at
each
other
in
amazement
nupkins
turned
suddenly
pale
could
the
man
weller
in
a
moment
of
remorse
have
divulged
some
secret
conspiracy
for
his
assassination
it
was
a
dreadful
thought
he
was
a
public
man
and
he
turned
paler
as
he
thought
of
julius
caesar
and
perceval
the
magistrate
looked
at
pickwick
again
and
beckoned
jinks
what
do
you
think
of
this
request
jinks
murmured
nupkins
jinks
who
didn
t
exactly
know
what
to
think
of
it
and
was
afraid
he
might
offend
smiled
feebly
after
a
dubious
fashion
and
screwing
up
the
corners
of
his
mouth
shook
his
head
slowly
from
side
to
side
mr
jinks
said
the
magistrate
gravely
you
are
an
at
this
little
expression
of
opinion
jinks
smiled
again
rather
more
feebly
than
before
and
edged
himself
by
degrees
back
into
his
own
corner
nupkins
debated
the
matter
within
himself
for
a
few
seconds
and
then
rising
from
his
chair
and
requesting
pickwick
and
sam
to
follow
him
led
the
way
into
a
small
room
which
opened
into
the
parlour
desiring
pickwick
to
walk
to
the
upper
end
of
the
little
apartment
and
holding
his
hand
upon
the
door
that
he
might
be
able
to
effect
an
immediate
escape
in
case
there
was
the
least
tendency
to
a
display
of
hostilities
nupkins
expressed
his
readiness
to
hear
the
communication
whatever
it
might
be
i
will
come
to
the
point
at
once
sir
said
pickwick
it
affects
yourself
and
your
credit
materially
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
sir
that
you
are
harbouring
in
your
house
a
gross
impostor
two
interrupted
sam
mulberry
agin
all
natur
for
tears
and
willainny
sam
said
pickwick
if
i
am
to
render
myself
intelligible
to
this
gentleman
i
must
beg
you
to
control
your
wery
sorry
sir
replied
weller
but
when
i
think
o
that
ere
job
i
can
t
help
opening
the
walve
a
inch
or
in
one
word
sir
said
pickwick
is
my
servant
right
in
suspecting
that
a
certain
captain
is
in
the
habit
of
visiting
here
because
added
pickwick
as
he
saw
that
nupkins
was
about
to
offer
a
very
indignant
interruption
because
if
he
be
i
know
that
person
to
be
a
hush
hush
said
nupkins
closing
the
door
know
him
to
be
what
sir
an
unprincipled
adventurer
a
dishonourable
character
a
man
who
preys
upon
society
and
makes
people
his
dupes
sir
his
absurd
his
foolish
his
wretched
dupes
sir
said
the
excited
pickwick
dear
me
said
nupkins
turning
very
red
and
altering
his
whole
manner
directly
dear
me
pickvick
said
sam
pickwick
said
the
magistrate
dear
me
pickwick
pray
take
a
seat
you
can
not
mean
this
captain
don
t
call
him
a
cap
en
said
sam
nor
neither
he
ain
t
neither
one
nor
t
other
he
s
a
strolling
actor
he
is
and
his
name
s
jingle
and
if
ever
there
was
a
wolf
in
a
mulberry
suit
that
ere
job
trotter
s
it
is
very
true
sir
said
pickwick
replying
to
the
magistrate
s
look
of
amazement
my
only
business
in
this
town
is
to
expose
the
person
of
whom
we
now
pickwick
proceeded
to
pour
into
the
ear
of
nupkins
an
abridged
account
of
all
jingle
s
atrocities
he
related
how
he
had
first
met
him
how
he
had
eloped
with
miss
wardle
how
he
had
cheerfully
resigned
the
lady
for
a
pecuniary
consideration
how
he
had
entrapped
himself
into
a
lady
s
at
midnight
and
how
he
pickwick
now
felt
it
his
duty
to
expose
his
assumption
of
his
present
name
and
rank
as
the
narrative
proceeded
all
the
warm
blood
in
the
body
of
nupkins
tingled
up
into
the
very
tips
of
his
ears
he
had
picked
up
the
captain
at
a
neighbouring
charmed
with
his
long
list
of
aristocratic
acquaintance
his
extensive
travel
and
his
fashionable
demeanour
nupkins
and
miss
nupkins
had
exhibited
captain
marshall
and
quoted
captain
and
hurled
captain
marshall
at
the
devoted
heads
of
their
select
circle
of
acquaintance
until
their
bosom
friends
porkenham
and
the
misses
porkenhams
and
sidney
porkenham
were
ready
to
burst
with
jealousy
and
despair
and
now
to
hear
after
all
that
he
was
a
needy
adventurer
a
strolling
player
and
if
not
a
swindler
something
so
very
like
it
that
it
was
hard
to
tell
the
difference
heavens
what
would
the
porkenhams
say
what
would
be
the
triumph
of
sidney
porkenham
when
he
found
that
his
addresses
had
been
slighted
for
such
a
rival
how
should
he
nupkins
meet
the
eye
of
old
porkenham
at
the
next
and
what
a
handle
would
it
be
for
the
opposition
magisterial
party
if
the
story
got
abroad
but
after
all
said
nupkins
brightening
for
a
moment
after
a
long
pause
after
all
this
is
a
mere
statement
captain
is
a
man
of
very
engaging
manners
and
i
dare
say
has
many
enemies
what
proof
have
you
of
the
truth
of
these
representations
confront
me
with
him
said
pickwick
that
is
all
i
ask
and
all
i
require
confront
him
with
me
and
my
friends
here
you
will
want
no
further
why
said
nupkins
that
might
be
very
easily
done
for
he
will
be
here
and
then
there
would
be
no
occasion
to
make
the
matter
public
just
just
for
the
young
man
s
own
sake
you
know
i
i
should
like
to
consult
nupkins
on
the
propriety
of
the
step
in
the
first
instance
though
at
all
events
pickwick
we
must
despatch
this
legal
business
before
we
can
do
anything
else
pray
step
back
into
the
next
into
the
next
room
they
went
grummer
said
the
magistrate
in
an
awful
voice
your
replied
grummer
with
the
smile
of
a
favourite
come
come
sir
said
the
magistrate
sternly
don
t
let
me
see
any
of
this
levity
here
it
is
very
unbecoming
and
i
can
assure
you
that
you
have
very
little
to
smile
at
was
the
account
you
gave
me
just
now
strictly
true
now
be
careful
sir
your
stammered
grummer
oh
you
are
confused
are
you
said
the
magistrate
mr
jinks
you
observe
this
confusion
certainly
sir
replied
jinks
now
said
the
magistrate
repeat
your
statement
grummer
and
again
i
warn
you
to
be
careful
jinks
take
his
words
the
unfortunate
grummer
proceeded
to
his
complaint
but
what
between
jinks
s
taking
down
his
words
and
the
magistrate
s
taking
them
up
his
natural
tendency
to
rambling
and
his
extreme
confusion
he
managed
to
get
involved
in
something
under
three
minutes
in
such
a
mass
of
entanglement
and
contradiction
that
nupkins
at
once
declared
he
didn
t
believe
him
so
the
fines
were
remitted
and
jinks
found
a
couple
of
bail
in
no
time
and
all
these
solemn
proceedings
having
been
satisfactorily
concluded
grummer
was
ignominiously
ordered
out
an
awful
instance
of
the
instability
of
human
greatness
and
the
uncertain
tenure
of
great
men
s
favour
nupkins
was
a
majestic
female
in
a
pink
gauze
turban
and
a
light
brown
wig
miss
nupkins
possessed
all
her
mamma
s
haughtiness
without
the
turban
and
all
her
without
the
wig
and
whenever
the
exercise
of
these
two
amiable
qualities
involved
mother
and
daughter
in
some
unpleasant
dilemma
as
they
not
infrequently
did
they
both
concurred
in
laying
the
blame
on
the
shoulders
of
nupkins
accordingly
when
nupkins
sought
nupkins
and
detailed
the
communication
which
had
been
made
by
pickwick
nupkins
suddenly
recollected
that
she
had
always
expected
something
of
the
kind
that
she
had
always
said
it
would
be
so
that
her
advice
was
never
taken
that
she
really
did
not
know
what
nupkins
supposed
she
was
and
so
forth
the
idea
said
miss
nupkins
forcing
a
tear
of
very
scanty
proportions
into
the
corner
of
each
eye
the
idea
of
my
being
made
such
a
fool
of
ah
you
may
thank
your
papa
my
dear
said
nupkins
how
i
have
implored
and
begged
that
man
to
inquire
into
the
captain
s
family
connections
how
i
have
urged
and
entreated
him
to
take
some
decisive
step
i
am
quite
certain
nobody
would
believe
it
but
my
dear
said
nupkins
don
t
talk
to
me
you
aggravating
thing
don
t
said
nupkins
my
love
said
nupkins
you
professed
yourself
very
fond
of
captain
you
have
constantly
asked
him
here
my
dear
and
you
have
lost
no
opportunity
of
introducing
him
didn
t
i
say
so
henrietta
cried
nupkins
appealing
to
her
daughter
with
the
air
of
a
female
didn
t
i
say
that
your
papa
would
turn
round
and
lay
all
this
at
my
door
didn
t
i
say
so
here
nupkins
sobbed
oh
pa
remonstrated
miss
nupkins
and
here
she
sobbed
too
isn
t
it
too
much
when
he
has
brought
all
this
disgrace
and
ridicule
upon
us
to
taunt
me
with
being
the
cause
of
it
exclaimed
nupkins
how
can
we
ever
show
ourselves
in
society
said
miss
nupkins
how
can
we
face
the
porkenhams
cried
nupkins
or
the
griggs
cried
miss
nupkins
or
the
slummintowkens
cried
nupkins
but
what
does
your
papa
care
what
is
it
to
at
this
dreadful
reflection
nupkins
wept
mental
anguish
and
miss
nupkins
followed
on
the
same
side
nupkins
s
tears
continued
to
gush
forth
with
great
velocity
until
she
had
gained
a
little
time
to
think
the
matter
over
when
she
decided
in
her
own
mind
that
the
best
thing
to
do
would
be
to
ask
pickwick
and
his
friends
to
remain
until
the
captain
s
arrival
and
then
to
give
pickwick
the
opportunity
he
sought
if
it
appeared
that
he
had
spoken
truly
the
captain
could
be
turned
out
of
the
house
without
noising
the
matter
abroad
and
they
could
easily
account
to
the
porkenhams
for
his
disappearance
by
saying
that
he
had
been
appointed
through
the
court
influence
of
his
family
to
the
of
sierra
leone
of
saugur
point
or
any
other
of
those
salubrious
climates
which
enchant
europeans
so
much
that
when
they
once
get
there
they
can
hardly
ever
prevail
upon
themselves
to
come
back
again
when
nupkins
dried
up
her
tears
miss
nupkins
dried
up
hers
and
nupkins
was
very
glad
to
settle
the
matter
as
nupkins
had
proposed
so
pickwick
and
his
friends
having
washed
off
all
marks
of
their
late
encounter
were
introduced
to
the
ladies
and
soon
afterwards
to
their
dinner
and
weller
whom
the
magistrate
with
his
peculiar
sagacity
had
discovered
in
half
an
hour
to
be
one
of
the
finest
fellows
alive
was
consigned
to
the
care
and
guardianship
of
muzzle
who
was
specially
enjoined
to
take
him
below
and
make
much
of
him
how
de
do
sir
said
muzzle
as
he
conducted
weller
down
the
kitchen
stairs
why
no
considerable
change
has
taken
place
in
the
state
of
my
system
since
i
see
you
cocked
up
behind
your
governor
s
chair
in
the
parlour
a
little
vile
ago
replied
sam

not
taking

notice

sam

fast
that

seems
to
stun
one
another

hardly
know
what
he
s
arter

the
great
merit
of
his
style
of
speaking

last
step

and
a
clean
jack

weller
applying
plenty
of
yellow
soap
to
the
towel
and
rubbing
away
till
his
face
shone
again
how
many
ladies

we
couldn

manners

dreadful
vulgar
and
the
boy
breathes
so
very
hard
while
he
s
eating
that
we
found
it
impossible
to
sit
at
table
with
young
grampus
said
weller

rejoined
muzzle

the
worst

to
the
fi
pun
when
this
ceremony
of
introduction
had
been
gone
through
the
cook
and
mary
retired
into
the
back
kitchen
to
titter
for
ten
minutes
then
returning
all
giggles
and
blushes
they
sat
down
to
dinner
weller
s
easy
manners
and
conversational
powers
had
such
irresistible
influence
with
his
new
friends
that
before
the
dinner
was
half
over
they
were
on
a
footing
of
perfect
intimacy
and
in
possession
of
a
full
account
of
the
delinquency
of
job
trotter
i
never

job
said
mary
no

that
gentleman
here
mary
laughed
and
said
the
cook

the
cook
laughed
and
said

imperence
replied
the
cook
in
a
high
state
of
delight
and
hereupon
the
cook
and
mary
laughed
again
till
what
between
the
beer
and
the
cold
meat
and
the
laughter
combined
the
latter
young
lady
was
brought
to
the
verge
of
choking
an
alarming
crisis
from
which
she
was
only
recovered
by
sundry
pats
on
the
back
and
other
necessary
attentions
most
delicately
administered
by
samuel
weller
in
the
midst
of
all
this
jollity
and
conviviality
a
loud
ring
was
heard
at
the
garden
gate
to
which
the
young
gentleman
who
took
his
meals
in
the
immediately
responded
weller
was
in
the
height
of
his
attentions
to
the
pretty
muzzle
was
busy
doing
the
honours
of
the
table
and
the
cook
had
just
paused
to
laugh
in
the
very
act
of
raising
a
huge
morsel
to
her
lips
when
the
kitchen
door
opened
and
in
walked
job
trotter
we
have
said
in
walked
job
trotter
but
the
statement
is
not
distinguished
by
our
usual
scrupulous
adherence
to
fact
the
door
opened
and
trotter
appeared
he
would
have
walked
in
and
was
in
the
very
act
of
doing
so
indeed
when
catching
sight
of
weller
he
involuntarily
shrank
back
a
pace
or
two
and
stood
gazing
on
the
unexpected
scene
before
him
perfectly
motionless
with
amazement
and
terror
here
he
is
said
sam
rising
with
great
glee
why
we
were
that
wery
moment
o
you
how
are
you
where
have
you
been
come
laying
his
hand
on
the
mulberry
collar
of
the
unresisting
job
weller
dragged
him
into
the
kitchen
and
locking
the
door
handed
the
key
to
muzzle
who
very
coolly
buttoned
it
up
in
a
side
pocket
well
here
s
a
game
cried
sam
only
think
o
my
master
havin
the
pleasure
o
meeting
yourn
upstairs
and
me
havin
the
joy
o
meetin
you
down
here
how
are
you
gettin
on
and
how
is
the
chandlery
bis
ness
likely
to
do
well
i
am
so
glad
to
see
you
how
happy
you
look
it
s
quite
a
treat
to
see
you
ain
t
it
muzzle
quite
said
muzzle
so
cheerful
he
is
said
sam
in
such
good
spirits
said
muzzle
and
so
glad
to
see
us
that
makes
it
so
much
more
comfortable
said
sam
sit
down
sit
trotter
suffered
himself
to
be
forced
into
a
chair
by
the
fireside
he
cast
his
small
eyes
first
on
weller
and
then
on
muzzle
but
said
nothing
well
now
said
sam
afore
these
here
ladies
i
should
jest
like
to
ask
you
as
a
sort
of
curiosity
whether
you
don
t
consider
yourself
as
nice
and
a
young
gen
l
m
n
as
ever
used
a
pink
check
and
the
number
four
collection
and
as
was
ever
to
be
married
to
a
cook
said
that
lady
indignantly
the
willin
and
leave
off
his
evil
ways
and
set
up
in
the
chandlery
line
arterwards
said
the
housemaid
now
i
ll
tell
you
what
it
is
young
man
said
muzzle
solemnly
enraged
at
the
last
two
allusions
this
here
lady
pointing
to
the
cook
keeps
company
with
me
and
when
you
presume
sir
to
talk
of
keeping
chandlers
shops
with
her
you
injure
me
in
one
of
the
most
delicatest
points
in
which
one
man
can
injure
another
do
you
understand
that
sir
here
muzzle
who
had
a
great
notion
of
his
eloquence
in
which
he
imitated
his
master
paused
for
a
reply
but
trotter
made
no
reply
so
muzzle
proceeded
in
a
solemn
manner
it
s
very
probable
sir
that
you
won
t
be
wanted
upstairs
for
several
minutes
sir
because
master
is
at
this
moment
particularly
engaged
in
settling
the
hash
of
sir
and
therefore
you
ll
have
leisure
sir
for
a
little
private
talk
with
me
sir
do
you
understand
that
sir
muzzle
again
paused
for
a
reply
and
again
trotter
disappointed
him
well
then
said
muzzle
i
m
very
sorry
to
have
to
explain
myself
before
ladies
but
the
urgency
of
the
case
will
be
my
excuse
the
back
kitchen
s
empty
sir
if
you
will
step
in
there
sir
weller
will
see
fair
and
we
can
have
mutual
satisfaction
till
the
bell
rings
follow
me
sir
as
muzzle
uttered
these
words
he
took
a
step
or
two
towards
the
door
and
by
way
of
saving
time
began
to
pull
off
his
coat
as
he
walked
along
now
the
cook
no
sooner
heard
the
concluding
words
of
this
desperate
challenge
and
saw
muzzle
about
to
put
it
into
execution
than
she
uttered
a
loud
and
piercing
shriek
and
rushing
on
job
trotter
who
rose
from
his
chair
on
the
instant
tore
and
buffeted
his
large
flat
face
with
an
energy
peculiar
to
excited
females
and
twining
her
hands
in
his
long
black
hair
tore
therefrom
about
enough
to
make
five
or
six
dozen
of
the
very
having
accomplished
this
feat
with
all
the
ardour
which
her
devoted
love
for
muzzle
inspired
she
staggered
back
and
being
a
lady
of
very
excitable
and
delicate
feelings
she
instantly
fell
under
the
dresser
and
fainted
away
at
this
moment
the
bell
rang
that
s
for
you
job
trotter
said
sam
and
before
trotter
could
offer
remonstrance
or
reply
even
before
he
had
time
to
stanch
the
wounds
inflicted
by
the
insensible
lady
sam
seized
one
arm
and
muzzle
the
other
and
one
pulling
before
and
the
other
pushing
behind
they
conveyed
him
upstairs
and
into
the
parlour
it
was
an
impressive
tableau
alfred
jingle
esquire
alias
captain
was
standing
near
the
door
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
and
a
smile
on
his
face
wholly
unmoved
by
his
very
unpleasant
situation
confronting
him
stood
pickwick
who
had
evidently
been
inculcating
some
high
moral
lesson
for
his
left
hand
was
beneath
his
coat
tail
and
his
right
extended
in
air
as
was
his
wont
when
delivering
himself
of
an
impressive
address
at
a
little
distance
stood
tupman
with
indignant
countenance
carefully
held
back
by
his
two
younger
friends
at
the
farther
end
of
the
room
were
nupkins
nupkins

miss

gloomily
grand
and
savagely
vexed

nupkins
with
magisterial
dignity
as

brought
in

prevents
me
from
detaining
these

and
impostors

a
foolish
mercy

jingle
laughed
very
heartily
and
job
rubbing
his
hands
with
delight
uttered
the
first
sound
he
had
given
vent
to
since
he
entered
the
house
a
low
noiseless
chuckle
which
seemed
to
intimate
that
he
enjoyed
his
laugh
too
much
to
let
any
of
it
escape
in
sound
mr
nupkins
said
the
elder
lady
this
is
not

fit
conversation

pickwick

much
greater
revenge
for

treatment

experienced

your
hands

that
of
your
hypocritical
friend

trotter
bowed
with
great
politeness
and
laid
his
hand
upon
his
heart
i
say
said
pickwick
growing
gradually
angry
that
i
might
have
taken
a
greater
revenge
but
i
content
myself
with
exposing
you
which
i
consider
a
duty
i
owe
to
society
this
is
a
leniency
sir
which
i
hope
you
will
when
pickwick
arrived
at
this
point
job
trotter
with
facetious
gravity
applied
his
hand
to
his
ear
as
if
desirous
not
to
lose
a
syllable
he
uttered
and
i
have
only
to
add
sir
said
pickwick
now
thoroughly
angry
that
i
consider
you
a
rascal
and
a
a
ruffian
and
and
worse
than
any
man

ever
saw
or
heard
of

pious
and
sanctified
vagabond

stuck
on
his
hat
in
his
old
fashion
and
strode
out
of
the
room
job
trotter
paused
looked
round
smiled
and
then
with
a
bow
of
mock
solemnity
to
pickwick
and
a
wink
to
weller
the
audacious
slyness
of
which
baffles
all
description
followed
the
footsteps
of
his
hopeful
master

pickwick

account
replied
his
master
for
the
first
time
since
his
engagement
weller
looked
for
a
moment
discontented
and
unhappy
but
his
countenance
immediately
cleared
up
for
the
wily
muzzle
by
concealing
himself
behind
the
street
door
and
rushing
violently
out
at
the
right
instant
contrived
with
great
dexterity
to
overturn
both
jingle
and
his
attendant
down
the
flight
of
steps
into
the
american
aloe
tubs
that
stood
beneath
having
discharged
my
duty

pickwick

it
or
have
consented
to
extricate
ourselves
in
this
way
from
our
previous
dilemma
had
we
not
been
impelled
by
a
strong
sense
of
duty
we
return
to
london
your
secret
is
safe
with
having
thus
entered
his
protest
against
their
treatment
of
the
morning
pickwick
bowed
low
to
the
ladies
and
notwithstanding
the
solicitations
of
the
family
left
the
room
with
his
friends
get
your
hat
sam
said
pickwick
it
s
below
stairs
sir
said
sam
and
he
ran
down
after
it
now
there
was
nobody
in
the
kitchen
but
the
pretty
housemaid
and
as
sam
s
hat
was
mislaid
he
had
to
look
for
it
and
the
pretty
housemaid
lighted
him
they
had
to
look
all
over
the
place
for
the
hat
the
pretty
housemaid
in
her
anxiety
to
find
it
went
down
on
her
knees
and
turned
over
all
the
things
that
were
heaped
together
in
a
little
corner
by
the
door
it
was
an
awkward
corner
you
couldn
t
get
at
it
without
shutting
the
door
first
here
it
is
said
the
pretty
housemaid
this
is
it
ain
t
it
let
me
look
said
sam
the
pretty
housemaid
had
stood
the
candle
on
the
floor
and
as
it
gave
a
very
dim
light
sam
was
obliged
to
go
down
on
before
he
could
see
whether
it
really
was
his
own
hat
or
not
it
was
a
remarkably
small
corner
and
so
it
was
nobody
s
fault
but
the
man
s
who
built
the
house
sam
and
the
pretty
housemaid
were
necessarily
very
close
together
yes
this
is
it
said
sam
said
the
pretty
housemaid
said
sam
and
as
he
said
it
he
dropped
the
hat
that
had
cost
so
much
trouble
in
looking
for
how
awkward
you
are
said
the
pretty
housemaid
you
ll
lose
it
again
if
you
don
t
take
so
just
to
prevent
his
losing
it
again
she
put
it
on
for
him
whether
it
was
that
the
pretty
housemaid
s
face
looked
prettier
still
when
it
was
raised
towards
sam
s
or
whether
it
was
the
accidental
consequence
of
their
being
so
near
to
each
other
is
matter
of
uncertainty
to
this
day
but
sam
kissed
her
you
don
t
mean
to
say
you
did
that
on
purpose
said
the
pretty
housemaid
blushing
no
i
didn
t
then
said
sam
but
i
will
so
he
kissed
her
again
sam
said
pickwick
calling
over
the
banisters
coming
sir
replied
sam
running
upstairs
how
long
you
have
been
said
pickwick
there
was
something
behind
the
door
sir
which
perwented
our
getting
it
open
for
ever
so
long
sir
replied
sam
and
this
was
the
first
passage
of
weller
s
first
love
chapter
xxvi
which
contains
a
brief
account
of
the
progress
of
the
action
of
bardell
against
pickwick
having
accomplished
the
main
end
and
object
of
his
journey
by
the
exposure
of
jingle
pickwick
resolved
on
immediately
returning
to
london
with
the
view
of
becoming
acquainted
with
the
proceedings
which
had
been
taken
against
him
in
the
meantime
by
dodson
and
fogg
acting
upon
this
resolution
with
all
the
energy
and
decision
of
his
character
he
mounted
to
the
back
seat
of
the
first
coach
which
left
ipswich
on
the
morning
after
the
memorable
occurrences
detailed
at
length
in
the
two
preceding
chapters
and
accompanied
by
his
three
friends
and
samuel
weller
arrived
in
the
metropolis
in
perfect
health
and
safety
the
same
evening
here
the
friends
for
a
short
time
separated
tupman
winkle
and
snodgrass
repaired
to
their
several
homes
to
make
such
preparations
as
might
be
requisite
for
their
forthcoming
visit
to
dingley
dell
and
pickwick
and
sam
took
up
their
present
abode
in
very
good
fashioned
and
comfortable
quarters
to
wit
the
george
and
vulture
tavern
and
hotel
george
yard
lombard
street
pickwick
had
dined
finished
his
second
pint
of
particular
port
pulled
his
silk
handkerchief
over
his
head
put
his
feet
on
the
fender
and
thrown
himself
back
in
an
when
the
entrance
of
weller
with
his
aroused
him
from
his
tranquil
meditation
sam
said
pickwick
sir
said
weller
i
have
just
been
thinking
sam
said
pickwick
that
having
left
a
good
many
things
at
bardell
s
in
goswell
street
i
ought
to
arrange
for
taking
them
away
before
i
leave
town
wery
good
sir
replied
weller
i
could
send
them
to
tupman
s
for
the
present
sam
continued
pickwick
but
before
we
take
them
away
it
is
necessary
that
they
should
be
looked
up
and
put
together
i
wish
you
would
step
up
to
goswell
street
sam
and
arrange
about
at
once
sir
inquired
weller
at
once
replied
pickwick
and
stay
sam
added
pickwick
pulling
out
his
purse
there
is
some
rent
to
pay
the
quarter
is
not
due
till
christmas
but
you
may
pay
it
and
have
done
with
it
a
month
s
notice
terminates
my
tenancy
here
it
is
written
out
give
it
and
tell
bardell
she
may
put
a
bill
up
as
soon
as
she
wery
good
sir
replied
weller
anythin
more
sir
nothing
more
weller
stepped
slowly
to
the
door
as
if
he
expected
something
more
slowly
opened
it
slowly
stepped
out
and
had
slowly
closed
it
within
a
couple
of
inches
when
pickwick
called
out
yes
sir
said
weller
stepping
quickly
back
and
closing
the
door
behind
him
i
have
no
objection
sam
to
your
endeavouring
to
ascertain
how
bardell
herself
seems
disposed
towards
me
and
whether
it
is
really
probable
that
this
vile
and
groundless
action
is
to
be
carried
to
extremity
i
say
i
do
not
object
to
you
doing
this
if
you
wish
it
sam
said
pickwick
sam
gave
a
short
nod
of
intelligence
and
left
the
room
pickwick
drew
the
silk
handkerchief
once
more
over
his
head
and
composed
himself
for
a
nap
weller
promptly
walked
forth
to
execute
his
commission
it
was
nearly
nine
o
clock
when
he
reached
goswell
street
a
couple
of
candles
were
burning
in
the
little
front
parlour
and
a
couple
of
caps
were
reflected
on
the
bardell
had
got
company
weller
knocked
at
the
door
and
after
a
pretty
long
interval
occupied
by
the
party
without
in
whistling
a
tune
and
by
the
party
within
in
persuading
a
refractory
flat
candle
to
allow
itself
to
be
lighted
a
pair
of
small
boots
pattered
over
the
and
master
bardell
presented
himself
well
young
townskip
said
sam
how
s
mother
she
s
pretty
well
replied
master
bardell
so
am
well
that
s
a
mercy
said
sam
tell
her
i
want
to
speak
to
her
will
you
my
hinfant
fernomenon
master
bardell
thus
adjured
placed
the
refractory
flat
candle
on
the
bottom
stair
and
vanished
into
the
front
parlour
with
his
message
the
two
caps
reflected
on
the
were
the
respective
dresses
of
a
couple
of
bardell
s
most
particular
acquaintance
who
had
just
stepped
in
to
have
a
quiet
cup
of
tea
and
a
little
warm
supper
of
a
couple
of
sets
of
pettitoes
and
some
toasted
cheese
the
cheese
was
simmering
and
browning
away
most
delightfully
in
a
little
dutch
oven
before
the
fire
the
pettitoes
were
getting
on
deliciously
in
a
little
tin
saucepan
on
the
hob
and
bardell
and
her
two
friends
were
getting
on
very
well
also
in
a
little
quiet
conversation
about
and
concerning
all
their
particular
friends
and
acquaintance
when
master
bardell
came
back
from
answering
the
door
and
delivered
the
message
intrusted
to
him
by
samuel
weller
mr
pickwick
s
servant
said
bardell
turning
pale
bless
my
soul
said
cluppins
well
i
raly
would
not
ha
believed
it
unless
i
had
ha
happened
to
ha
been
here
said
sanders
cluppins
was
a
little
brisk
woman
sanders
was
a
big
fat
personage
and
the
two
were
the
company
bardell
felt
it
proper
to
be
agitated
and
as
none
of
the
three
exactly
knew
whether
under
existing
circumstances
any
communication
otherwise
than
through
dodson
fogg
ought
to
be
held
with
pickwick
s
servant
they
were
all
rather
taken
by
surprise
in
this
state
of
indecision
obviously
the
first
thing
to
be
done
was
to
thump
the
boy
for
finding
weller
at
the
door
so
his
mother
thumped
him
and
he
cried
melodiously
hold
your
noise
do
you
naughty
creetur
said
bardell
yes
don
t
worrit
your
poor
mother
said
sanders
she
s
quite
enough
to
worrit
her
as
it
is
without
you
tommy
said
cluppins
with
sympathising
resignation
ah
worse
luck
poor
lamb
said
sanders
at
all
which
moral
reflections
master
bardell
howled
the
louder
now
what
shall
i
do
said
bardell
to
cluppins
i
think
you
ought
to
see
him
replied
cluppins
but
on
no
account
without
a
i
think
two
witnesses
would
be
more
lawful
said
sanders
who
like
the
other
friend
was
bursting
with
curiosity
perhaps
he
d
better
come
in
here
said
bardell
to
be
sure
replied
cluppins
eagerly
catching
at
the
idea
walk
in
young
man
and
shut
the
street
door
first
weller
immediately
took
the
hint
and
presenting
himself
in
the
parlour
explained
his
business
to
bardell
thus
wery
sorry
to
casion
any
personal
inconwenience
ma
am
as
the
housebreaker
said
to
the
old
lady
when
he
put
her
on
the
fire
but
as
me
and
my
governor
s
only
jest
come
to
town
and
is
jest
going
away
agin
it
can
t
be
helped
you
of
course
the
young
man
can
t
help
the
faults
of
his
master
said
cluppins
much
struck
by
weller
s
appearance
and
conversation
certainly
not
chimed
in
sanders
who
from
certain
wistful
glances
at
the
little
tin
saucepan
seemed
to
be
engaged
in
a
mental
calculation
of
the
probable
extent
of
the
pettitoes
in
the
event
of
sam
s
being
asked
to
stop
to
supper
so
all
i
ve
come
about
is
jest
this
here
said
sam
disregarding
the
interruption
first
to
give
my
governor
s
notice
there
it
is
secondly
to
pay
the
rent
here
it
is
thirdly
to
say
as
all
his
things
is
to
be
put
together
and
give
to
anybody
as
we
sends
for
em
fourthly
that
you
may
let
the
place
as
soon
as
you
like
and
that
s
whatever
has
happened
said
bardell
i
always
have
said
and
always
will
say
that
in
every
respect
but
one
pickwick
has
always
behaved
himself
like
a
perfect
gentleman
his
money
always
as
good
as
the
bank
as
bardell
said
this
she
applied
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
and
went
out
of
the
room
to
get
the
receipt
sam
well
knew
that
he
had
only
to
remain
quiet
and
the
women
were
sure
to
talk
so
he
looked
alternately
at
the
tin
saucepan
the
toasted
cheese
the
wall
and
the
ceiling
in
profound
silence
poor
dear
said
cluppins
ah
poor
thing
replied
sanders
sam
said
nothing
he
saw
they
were
coming
to
the
subject
i
raly
can
not
contain
myself
said
cluppins
when
i
think
of
such
perjury
i
don
t
wish
to
say
anything
to
make
you
uncomfortable
young
man
but
your
master
s
an
old
brute
and
i
wish
i
had
him
here
to
tell
him
i
wish
you
had
said
sam
to
see
how
dreadful
she
takes
on
going
moping
about
and
taking
no
pleasure
in
nothing
except
when
her
friends
comes
in
out
of
charity
to
sit
with
her
and
make
her
comfortable
resumed
cluppins
glancing
at
the
tin
saucepan
and
the
dutch
oven
it
s
shocking
barbareous
said
sanders
and
your
master
young
man
a
gentleman
with
money
as
could
never
feel
the
expense
of
a
wife
no
more
than
nothing
continued
cluppins
with
great
volubility
why
there
ain
t
the
faintest
shade
of
an
excuse
for
his
behaviour
why
don
t
he
marry
her
ah
said
sam
to
be
sure
that
s
the
question
indeed
retorted
cluppins
she
d
question
him
if
she
d
my
spirit
hows
ever
there
is
law
for
us
women
mis
rable
creeturs
as
they
d
make
us
if
they
could
and
that
your
master
will
find
out
young
man
to
his
cost
afore
he
s
six
months
at
this
consolatory
reflection
cluppins
bridled
up
and
smiled
at
sanders
who
smiled
back
again
the
action
s
going
on
and
no
mistake
thought
sam
as
bardell
with
the
receipt
here
s
the
receipt
weller
said
bardell
and
here
s
the
change
and
i
hope
you
ll
take
a
little
drop
of
something
to
keep
the
cold
out
if
it
s
only
for
old
acquaintance
sake
sam
saw
the
advantage
he
should
gain
and
at
once
acquiesced
whereupon
bardell
produced
from
a
small
closet
a
black
bottle
and
a
glass
and
so
great
was
her
abstraction
in
her
deep
mental
affliction
that
after
filling
weller
s
glass
she
brought
out
three
more
glasses
and
filled
them
too
lauk
bardell
said
cluppins
see
what
you
ve
been
and
done
well
that
is
a
good
one
ejaculated
sanders
ah
my
poor
head
said
bardell
with
a
faint
smile
sam
understood
all
this
of
course
so
he
said
at
once
that
he
never
could
drink
before
supper
unless
a
lady
drank
with
him
a
great
deal
of
laughter
ensued
and
sanders
volunteered
to
humour
him
so
she
took
a
slight
sip
out
of
her
glass
then
sam
said
it
must
go
all
round
so
they
all
took
a
slight
sip
then
little
cluppins
proposed
as
a
toast
success
to
bardell
agin
pickwick
and
then
the
ladies
emptied
their
glasses
in
honour
of
the
sentiment
and
got
very
talkative
directly
i
suppose
you
ve
heard
what
s
going
forward
weller
said
bardell
i
ve
heerd
somethin
on
it
replied
sam
it
s
a
terrible
thing
to
be
dragged
before
the
public
in
that
way
weller
said
bardell
but
i
see
now
that
it
s
the
only
thing
i
ought
to
do
and
my
lawyers
dodson
and
fogg
tell
me
that
with
the
evidence
as
we
shall
call
we
must
succeed
i
don
t
know
what
i
should
do
weller
if
i
didn
the
mere
idea
of
bardell
s
failing
in
her
action
affected
sanders
so
deeply
that
she
was
under
the
necessity
of
refilling
and
emptying
her
glass
immediately
feeling
as
she
said
afterwards
that
if
she
hadn
t
had
the
presence
of
mind
to
do
so
she
must
have
dropped
ven
is
it
expected
to
come
on
inquired
sam
either
in
february
or
march
replied
bardell
what
a
number
of
witnesses
there
ll
be
won
t
there
said
cluppins
ah
won
t
there
replied
sanders
and
won
t
dodson
and
fogg
be
wild
if
the
plaintiff
shouldn
t
get
it
added
cluppins
when
they
do
it
all
on
speculation
ah
won
t
they
said
sanders
but
the
plaintiff
must
get
it
resumed
cluppins
i
hope
so
said
bardell
oh
there
can
t
be
any
doubt
about
it
rejoined
sanders
vell
said
sam
rising
and
setting
down
his
glass
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
vish
you
thank
ee
weller
said
bardell
fervently
and
of
them
dodson
and
foggs
as
does
these
sort
o
things
on
spec
continued
weller
as
vell
as
for
the
other
kind
and
gen
rous
people
o
the
same
purfession
as
sets
people
by
the
ears
free
gratis
for
nothin
and
sets
their
clerks
to
work
to
find
out
little
disputes
among
their
neighbours
and
acquaintances
as
vants
settlin
by
means
of
lawsuits
all
i
can
say
o
them
is
that
i
vish
they
had
the
reward
i
d
give
ah
i
wish
they
had
the
reward
that
every
kind
and
generous
heart
would
be
inclined
to
bestow
upon
them
said
the
gratified
bardell
amen
to
that
replied
sam
and
a
fat
and
happy
liven
they
d
get
out
of
it
wish
you
to
the
great
relief
of
sanders
sam
was
allowed
to
depart
without
any
reference
on
the
part
of
the
hostess
to
the
pettitoes
and
toasted
cheese
to
which
the
ladies
with
such
juvenile
assistance
as
master
bardell
could
afford
soon
afterwards
rendered
the
amplest
justice
indeed
they

makes
a
pilgrimage
to
dorking
and
beholds
his
there
still
remaining
an
interval
of
two
days
before
the
time
agreed
upon
for
the
departure
of
the
pickwickians
to
dingley
dell
weller
sat
himself
down
in
a
back
room
at
the
george
and
vulture
after
eating
an
early
dinner
to
muse
on
the
best
way
of
disposing
of
his
time
it
was
a
remarkably
fine
day
and
he
had
not
turned
the
matter
over
in
his
mind
ten
minutes
when
he
was
suddenly
stricken
filial
and
affectionate
and
it
occurred
to
him
so
strongly
that
he
ought
to
go
down
and
see
his
father
and
pay
his
duty
to
his
that
he
was
lost
in
astonishment
at
his
own
remissness
in
never
thinking
of
this
moral
obligation
before
anxious
to
atone
for
his
past
neglect
without
another
hour
s
delay
he
straightway
walked
upstairs
to
pickwick
and
requested
leave
of
absence
for
this
laudable
purpose
certainly
sam
certainly
said
pickwick
his
eyes
glistening
with
delight
at
this
manifestation
of
filial
feeling
on
the
part
of
his
attendant
certainly
weller
made
a
grateful
bow
i
am
very
glad
to
see
that
you
have
so
high
a
sense
of
your
duties
as
a
son
sam
said
pickwick
i
always
had
sir
replied
weller
that
s
a
very
gratifying
reflection
sam
said
pickwick
approvingly
wery
sir
replied
weller
if
ever
i
wanted
anythin
o
my
father
i
always
asked
for
it
in
a
wery
spectful
and
obligin
manner
if
he
didn
t
give
it
me
i
took
it
for
fear
i
should
be
led
to
do
anythin
wrong
through
not
havin
it
i
saved
him
a
world
o
trouble
this
vay
that
s
not
precisely
what
i
meant
sam
said
pickwick
shaking
his
head
with
a
slight
smile
all
good
feelin
sir
the
wery
best
intentions
as
the
gen
l
m
n
said
ven
he
run
away
from
his
wife
cos
she
seemed
unhappy
with
him
replied
weller
you
may
go
sam
said
pickwick
thank
ee
sir
replied
weller
and
having
made
his
best
bow
and
put
on
his
best
clothes
sam
planted
himself
on
the
top
of
the
arundel
coach
and
journeyed
on
to
dorking
the
marquis
of
granby
in
weller
s
time
was
quite
a
model
of
a
roadside
of
the
better
class
just
large
enough
to
be
convenient
and
small
enough
to
be
snug
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
was
a
large
on
a
high
post
representing
the
head
and
shoulders
of
a
gentleman
with
an
apoplectic
countenance
in
a
red
coat
with
deep
blue
facings
and
a
touch
of
the
same
blue
over
his
cornered
hat
for
a
sky
over
that
again
were
a
pair
of
flags
beneath
the
last
button
of
his
coat
were
a
couple
of
cannon
and
the
whole
formed
an
expressive
and
undoubted
likeness
of
the
marquis
of
granby
of
glorious
memory
the
bar
window
displayed
a
choice
collection
of
geranium
plants
and
a
row
of
spirit
phials
the
open
shutters
bore
a
variety
of
golden
inscriptions
eulogistic
of
good
beds
and
neat
wines
and
the
choice
group
of
countrymen
and
hostlers
lounging
about
the
stable
door
and
afforded
presumptive
proof
of
the
excellent
quality
of
the
ale
and
spirits
which
were
sold
within
sam
weller
paused
when
he
dismounted
from
the
coach
to
note
all
these
little
indications
of
a
thriving
business
with
the
eye
of
an
experienced
traveller
and
having
done
so
stepped
in
at
once
highly
satisfied
with
everything
he
had
observed
now
then
said
a
shrill
female
voice
the
instant
sam
thrust
his
head
in
at
the
door
what
do
you
want
young
man
sam
looked
round
in
the
direction
whence
the
voice
proceeded
it
came
from
a
rather
stout
lady
of
comfortable
appearance
who
was
seated
beside
the
fireplace
in
the
bar
blowing
the
fire
to
make
the
kettle
boil
for
tea
she
was
not
alone
for
on
the
other
side
of
the
fireplace
sitting
bolt
upright
in
a
chair
was
a
man
in
threadbare
black
clothes
with
a
back
almost
as
long
and
stiff
as
that
of
the
chair
itself
who
caught
sam
s
most
particular
and
especial
attention
at
once
he
was
a
man
with
a
long
thin
countenance
and
a
sort
of
eye
rather
sharp
but
decidedly
bad
he
wore
very
short
trousers
and
black
cotton
stockings
which
like
the
rest
of
his
apparel
were
particularly
rusty
his
looks
were
starched
but
his
white
neckerchief
was
not
and
its
long
limp
ends
straggled
over
his
waistcoat
in
a
very
uncouth
and
unpicturesque
fashion
a
pair
of
old
worn
beaver
gloves
a
hat
and
a
faded
green
umbrella
with
plenty
of
whalebone
sticking
through
the
bottom
as
if
to
counterbalance
the
want
of
a
handle
at
the
top
lay
on
a
chair
beside
him
and
being
disposed
in
a
very
tidy
and
careful
manner
seemed
to
imply
that
the
man
whoever
he
was
had
no
intention
of
going
away
in
a
hurry
to
do
the
man
justice
he
would
have
been
very
far
from
wise
if
he
had
entertained
any
such
intention
for
to
judge
from
all
appearances
he
must
have
been
possessed
of
a
most
desirable
circle
of
acquaintance
if
he
could
have
reasonably
expected
to
be
more
comfortable
anywhere
else
the
fire
was
blazing
brightly
under
the
influence
of
the
bellows
and
the
kettle
was
singing
gaily
under
the
influence
of
both
a
small
tray
of
was
arranged
on
the
table
a
plate
of
hot
buttered
toast
was
gently
simmering
before
the
fire
and
the
man
himself
was
busily
engaged
in
converting
a
large
slice
of
bread
into
the
same
agreeable
edible
through
the
instrumentality
of
a
long
brass
beside
him
stood
a
glass
of
reeking
hot
with
a
slice
of
lemon
in
it
and
every
time
the
man
stopped
to
bring
the
round
of
toast
to
his
eye
with
the
view
of
ascertaining
how
it
got
on
he
imbibed
a
drop
or
two
of
the
hot
and
smiled
upon
the
rather
stout
lady
as
she
blew
the
fire
sam
was
so
lost
in
the
contemplation
of
this
comfortable
scene
that
he
suffered
the
first
inquiry
of
the
rather
stout
lady
to
pass
unheeded
it
was
not
until
it
had
been
twice
repeated
each
time
in
a
shriller
tone
that
he
became
conscious
of
the
impropriety
of
his
behaviour
governor
in
inquired
sam
in
reply
to
the
question
no
he
isn
t
replied
weller
for
the
rather
stout
lady
was
no
other
than
the
quondam
relict
and
sole
executrix
of
the
clarke
no
he
isn
t
and
i
don
t
expect
him
i
suppose
he
s
drivin
up
said
sam
he
may
be
or
he
may
not
replied
weller
buttering
the
round
of
toast
which
the
man
had
just
finished
i
don
t
know
and
what
s
more
i
don
t
ask
a
blessin
the
man
did
as
he
was
desired
and
instantly
commenced
on
the
toast
with
fierce
voracity
the
appearance
of
the
man
had
induced
sam
at
first
sight
to
more
than
half
suspect
that
he
was
the
of
whom
his
estimable
parent
had
spoken
the
moment
he
saw
him
eat
all
doubt
on
the
subject
was
removed
and
he
perceived
at
once
that
if
he
purposed
to
take
up
his
temporary
quarters
where
he
was
he
must
make
his
footing
good
without
delay
he
therefore
commenced
proceedings
by
putting
his
arm
over
the
of
the
bar
coolly
unbolting
it
and
leisurely
walking
in
said
sam
how
are
you
why
i
do
believe
he
is
a
weller
said
raising
her
eyes
to
sam
s
face
with
no
very
gratified
expression
of
countenance
i
rayther
think
he
is
said
the
imperturbable
sam
and
i
hope
this
here
reverend
gen
l
m
n
ll
excuse
me
saying
that
i
wish
i
was
as
owns
you
this
was
a
compliment
it
implied
that
weller
was
a
most
agreeable
female
and
also
that
stiggins
had
a
clerical
appearance
it
made
a
visible
impression
at
once
and
sam
followed
up
his
advantage
by
kissing
his
get
along
with
you
said
weller
pushing
him
away
for
shame
young
man
said
the
gentleman
with
the
red
nose
no
offence
sir
no
offence
replied
sam
you
re
wery
right
though
it
ain
t
the
right
sort
o
thing
ven
is
young
and
looking
is
it
sir
it
s
all
vanity
said
stiggins
ah
so
it
is
said
weller
setting
her
cap
to
rights
sam
thought
it
was
too
but
he
held
his
peace
the
seemed
by
no
means
best
pleased
with
sam
s
arrival
and
when
the
first
effervescence
of
the
compliment
had
subsided
even
weller
looked
as
if
she
could
have
spared
him
without
the
smallest
inconvenience
however
there
he
was
and
as
he
couldn
t
be
decently
turned
out
they
all
three
sat
down
to
tea
and
how
s
father
said
sam
at
this
inquiry
weller
raised
her
hands
and
turned
up
her
eyes
as
if
the
subject
were
too
painful
to
be
alluded
to
stiggins
groaned
what
s
the
matter
with
that
ere
gen
l
m
n
inquired
sam
he
s
shocked
at
the
way
your
father
goes
on
in
replied
weller
oh
he
is
is
he
said
sam
and
with
too
good
reason
added
weller
gravely
stiggins
took
up
a
fresh
piece
of
toast
and
groaned
heavily
he
is
a
dreadful
reprobate
said
weller
a
man
of
wrath
exclaimed
stiggins
he
took
a
large
bite
out
of
the
toast
and
groaned
again
sam
felt
very
strongly
disposed
to
give
the
reverend
stiggins
something
to
groan
for
but
he
repressed
his
inclination
and
merely
asked
what
s
the
old
un
up
to
now
up
to
indeed
said
weller
oh
he
has
a
hard
heart
night
after
night
does
this
excellent
man
don
t
frown
stiggins
i
you
excellent
man
come
and
sit
here
for
hours
together
and
it
has
not
the
least
effect
upon
well
that
is
odd
said
sam
it
ud
have
a
wery
considerable
effect
upon
me
if
i
wos
in
his
place
i
know
the
fact
is
my
young
friend
said
stiggins
solemnly
he
has
an
obderrate
bosom
oh
my
young
friend
who
else
could
have
resisted
the
pleading
of
sixteen
of
our
fairest
sisters
and
withstood
their
exhortations
to
subscribe
to
our
noble
society
for
providing
the
infant
negroes
in
the
west
indies
with
flannel
waistcoats
and
moral
handkerchiefs
what
s
a
moral
said
sam
i
never
see
one
o
them
articles
o
those
which
combine
amusement
with
instruction
my
young
friend
replied
stiggins
blending
select
tales
with
oh
i
know
said
sam
them
as
hangs
up
in
the
shops
with
beggars
petitions
and
all
that
ere
upon
em
stiggins
began
a
third
round
of
toast
and
nodded
assent
and
he
wouldn
t
be
persuaded
by
the
ladies
wouldn
t
he
said
sam
sat
and
smoked
his
pipe
and
said
the
infant
negroes
were
what
did
he
say
the
infant
negroes
were
said
weller
little
humbugs
replied
stiggins
deeply
affected
said
the
infant
negroes
were
little
humbugs
repeated
weller
and
they
both
groaned
at
the
atrocious
conduct
of
the
elder
weller
a
great
many
more
iniquities
of
a
similar
nature
might
have
been
disclosed
only
the
toast
being
all
eaten
the
tea
having
got
very
weak
and
sam
holding
out
no
indications
of
meaning
to
go
stiggins
suddenly
recollected
that
he
had
a
most
pressing
appointment
with
the
shepherd
and
took
himself
off
accordingly
the
had
been
scarcely
put
away
and
the
hearth
swept
up
when
the
london
coach
deposited
weller
senior
at
the
door
his
legs
deposited
him
in
the
bar
and
his
eyes
showed
him
his
son
what
sammy
exclaimed
the
father
what
old
nobs
ejaculated
the
son
and
they
shook
hands
heartily
wery
glad
to
see
you
sammy
said
the
elder
weller
though
how
you
ve
managed
to
get
over
your

a
mystery
to
me
i
only
vish

sam

weller

of
hours
arter

so

just
give

mixed
two
glasses
of
and
produced
a
couple
of
pipes
the
father
and
son
sitting
down
opposite
each
other
sam
on
one
side
of
the
fire
in
the
chair
and
weller
senior
on
the
other
in
an
easy
ditto
they
proceeded
to
enjoy
themselves
with
all
due
gravity

sammy
asked
weller
senior
dryly
after
a
long
silence
sam
nodded
an
expressive
assent
chap
inquired
weller
sam
nodded
again
amiable
man
that
ere
sammy
said
weller
smoking
violently

sam

up
calls
again
on

for

to

five
shillin

and
goes
on
doubling
till
he
gets
it
up
to
a
five
pund
note
in
no
time
like
them
sums
in
the
rithmetic
book
bout
the
nails
in
the
horse
s
shoes
sam
intimated
by
a
nod
that
he
recollected
the
problem
alluded
to
by
his
parent
so
you
vouldn
t
subscribe
to
the
flannel
veskits
said
sam
after
another
interval
of
smoking
cert
nly
not

weller
what

the
good
o
flannel
veskits
to
the
young
niggers
abroad
but
i

tell

what
it

sammy
said
weller
lowering
his
voice
and
bending
across
the
fireplace
i
d
come
down
wery
handsome
towards
strait
veskits
for
some
people
at
as
weller
said
this
he
slowly
recovered
his
former
position
and
winked
at
his
in
a
profound
manner
it
cert
nly
seems
a
queer
start
to
send
out
ankerchers
to
people
as
don
t
know
the
use
on
em
observed
sam
they
re
alvays
some
gammon
of
that
sort
sammy
replied
his
father
t
other
sunday
i
wos
walkin
up
the
road
wen
who
should
i
see
at
a
chapel
door
with
a
blue
in
her
hand
but
your
i
werily
believe
there
was
change
for
a
couple
o
suv
rins
in
it
then
sammy
all
in
ha
pence
and
as
the
people
come
out
they
rattled
the
pennies
in
it
till
you
d
ha
thought
that
no
mortal
plate
as
ever
was
baked
could
ha
stood
the
wear
and
tear
what
d
ye
think
it
was
all
for
for
another
perhaps
said
sam
not
a
bit
on
it
replied
the
father
for
the
shepherd
s
the
shepherd
s
said
sam
ay
replied
weller
there
was
three
quarters
owin
and
the
shepherd
hadn
t
paid
a
farden
not
he
perhaps
it
might
be
on
account
that
the
water
warn
t
o
much
use
to
him
for
it
s
wery
little
o
that
tap
he
drinks
sammy
wery
he
knows
a
trick
worth
a
good
of
that
he
does
hows
ever
it
warn
t
paid
and
so
they
cuts
the
water
off
down
goes
the
shepherd
to
chapel
gives
out
as
he
s
a
persecuted
saint
and
says
he
hopes
the
heart
of
the
turncock
as
cut
the
water
off
ll
be
softened
and
turned

out
by
a
variety
of
nods
and
contortions
of
the
eye
emptied
his
glass
at
a
draught
and
knocked
the
ashes
out
of
his
pipe
with
native
dignity
he
was
engaged
in
this
operation
when
a
shrill
voice
was
heard
in
the
passage
here
s
your
dear
relation
sammy
said
weller
and
hurried
into
the
room
oh

the
pipe
by
the
ingenious
process
of
holding
to
the
bowl
thereof
between
the
tongs
a
coal
from
the
adjacent
fire
and
what

more
my

in
at
this
announcement
weller
hastily
wiped
off
the
tears
which
she
had
just
begun
to
force
on
and
drew
his
chair
sullenly
into
the
stiggins
was
easily
prevailed
on
to
take
another
glass
of
the
hot
and
a
second
and
a
third
and
then
to
refresh
himself
with
a
slight
supper
previous
to
beginning
again
he
sat
on
the
same
side
as
weller
senior
and
every
time
he
could
contrive
to
do
so
unseen
by
his
wife
that
gentleman
indicated
to
his
son
the
hidden
emotions
of
his
bosom
by
shaking
his
fist
over
the
s
head
a
process
which
afforded
his
son
the
most
unmingled
delight
and
satisfaction
the
more
especially
as
stiggins
went
on
quietly
drinking
the
hot
wholly
unconscious
of
what
was
going
forward
the
major
part
of
the
conversation
was
confined
to
weller
and
the
reverend
stiggins
and
the
topics
principally
descanted
on
were
the
virtues
of
the
shepherd
the
worthiness
of
his
flock
and
the
high
crimes
and
misdemeanours
of
everybody
beside
dissertations
which
the
elder
weller
occasionally
interrupted
by
references
to
a
gentleman
of
the
name
of
walker
and
other
running
commentaries
of
the
same
kind
at
length
stiggins
with
several
most
indubitable
symptoms
of
having
quite
as
much
about
him
as
he
could
comfortably
accommodate
took
his
hat
and
his
leave
and
sam
was
immediately
afterwards
shown
to
bed
by
his
father
the
respectable
old
gentleman
wrung
his
hand
fervently
and
seemed
disposed
to
address
some
observation
to
his
son
but
on
weller
advancing
towards
him
he
appeared
to
relinquish
that
intention
and
abruptly
bade
him
sam
was
up
betimes
next
day
and
having
partaken
of
a
hasty
breakfast
prepared
to
return
to
london
he
had
scarcely
set
foot
without
the
house
when
his
father
stood
before
him
goin
sammy
inquired
weller
off
at
once
replied
sam
i
vish
you
could
muffle
that
ere
stiggins
and
take
him
vith
you
said
weller
i
am
ashamed
on
you
said
sam
reproachfully
what
do
you
let
him
show
his
red
nose
in
the
markis
o
granby
at
all
for
weller
the
elder
fixed
on
his
son
an
earnest
look
and
replied

understand
a
good
many
things
as
you
don

understand
now
but
vether
it
s
worth
while
goin
through
so
much
to
learn
so
little
as
the
said
ven
he
got
to
the
end
of
the
alphabet

a
matter
o
taste
i
rayther
think
it
isn

said
sam
tar

replied
his
father
i

only
got
to
say
this
here
said
sam
stopping
short
that
if
i
was
the
properiator
o
the
markis
o
granby
and
that
ere
stiggins
came
and
made
toast
in
my
bar
i

what
interposed
weller
with
great
anxiety
what
pison
his
said
sam
no
said
weller
shaking
his
son
eagerly
by
the
hand
would
you
raly
you
though
i

said
sam
i
wouldn
t
be
too
hard
upon
him
at
first
i
d
drop
him
in
the
and
put
the
lid
on
and
if
i
found
he
was
insensible
to
kindness
i
d
try
the
other
the
elder
weller
bestowed
a
look
of
deep
unspeakable
admiration
on
his
son
and
having
once
more
grasped
his
hand
walked
slowly
away
revolving
in
his
mind
the
numerous
reflections
to
which
his
advice
had
given
rise
sam
looked
after
him
until
he
turned
a
corner
of
the
road
and
then
set
forward
on
his
walk
to
london
he
meditated
at
first
on
the
probable
consequences
of
his
own
advice
and
the
likelihood
of
his
father
s
adopting
it
he
dismissed
the
subject
from
his
mind
however
with
the
consolatory
reflection
that
time
alone
would
show
and
this
is
the
reflection
we
would
impress
upon
the
reader
chapter
xxviii
a
christmas
chapter
containing
an
account
of
a
wedding
and
some
other
sports
beside
which
although
in
their
way
even
as
good
customs
as
marriage
itself
are
not
quite
so
religiously
kept
up
in
these
degenerate
times
as
brisk
as
bees
if
not
altogether
as
light
as
fairies
did
the
four
pickwickians
assemble
on
the
morning
of
the
day
of
december
in
the
year
of
grace
in
which
these
their
adventures
were
undertaken
and
accomplished
christmas
was
close
at
hand
in
all
his
bluff
and
hearty
honesty
it
was
the
season
of
hospitality
merriment
and
the
old
year
was
preparing
like
an
ancient
philosopher
to
call
his
friends
around
him
and
amidst
the
sound
of
feasting
and
revelry
to
pass
gently
and
calmly
away
gay
and
merry
was
the
time
and
right
gay
and
merry
were
at
least
four
of
the
numerous
hearts
that
were
gladdened
by
its
coming
and
numerous
indeed
are
the
hearts
to
which
christmas
brings
a
brief
season
of
happiness
and
enjoyment
how
many
families
whose
members
have
been
dispersed
and
scattered
far
and
wide
in
the
restless
struggles
of
life
are
then
reunited
and
meet
once
again
in
that
happy
state
of
companionship
and
mutual
goodwill
which
is
a
source
of
such
pure
and
unalloyed
delight
and
one
so
incompatible
with
the
cares
and
sorrows
of
the
world
that
the
religious
belief
of
the
most
civilised
nations
and
the
rude
traditions
of
the
roughest
savages
alike
number
it
among
the
first
joys
of
a
future
condition
of
existence
provided
for
the
blessed
and
happy
how
many
old
recollections
and
how
many
dormant
sympathies
does
christmas
time
awaken
we
write
these
words
now
many
miles
distant
from
the
spot
at
which
year
after
year
we
met
on
that
day
a
merry
and
joyous
circle
many
of
the
hearts
that
throbbed
so
gaily
then
have
ceased
to
beat
many
of
the
looks
that
shone
so
brightly
then
have
ceased
to
glow
the
hands
we
grasped
have
grown
cold
the
eyes
we
sought
have
hid
their
lustre
in
the
grave
and
yet
the
old
house
the
room
the
merry
voices
and
smiling
faces
the
jest
the
laugh
the
most
minute
and
trivial
circumstances
connected
with
those
happy
meetings
crowd
upon
our
mind
at
each
recurrence
of
the
season
as
if
the
last
assemblage
had
been
but
yesterday
happy
happy
christmas
that
can
win
us
back
to
the
delusions
of
our
childish
days
that
can
recall
to
the
old
man
the
pleasures
of
his
youth
that
can
transport
the
sailor
and
the
traveller
thousands
of
miles
away
back
to
his
own
fireside
and
his
quiet
home
but
we
are
so
taken
up
and
occupied
with
the
good
qualities
of
this
saint
christmas
that
we
are
keeping
pickwick
and
his
friends
waiting
in
the
cold
on
the
outside
of
the
muggleton
coach
which
they
have
just
attained
well
wrapped
up
in
shawls
and
comforters
the
portmanteaus
and
have
been
stowed
away
and
weller
and
the
guard
are
endeavouring
to
insinuate
into
the
boot
a
huge
several
sizes
too
large
for
it
which
is
snugly
packed
up
in
a
long
brown
basket
with
a
layer
of
straw
over
the
top
and
which
has
been
left
to
the
last
in
order
that
he
may
repose
in
safety
on
the
barrels
of
real
native
oysters
all
the
property
of
pickwick
which
have
been
arranged
in
regular
order
at
the
bottom
of
the
receptacle
the
interest
displayed
in
pickwick
s
countenance
is
most
intense
as
weller
and
the
guard
try
to
squeeze
the
into
the
boot
first
head
first
and
then
tail
first
and
then
top
upward
and
then
bottom
upward
and
then
and
then
all
of
which
artifices
the
implacable
sturdily
resists
until
the
guard
accidentally
hits
him
in
the
very
middle
of
the
basket
whereupon
he
suddenly
disappears
into
the
boot
and
with
him
the
head
and
shoulders
of
the
guard
himself
who
not
calculating
upon
so
sudden
a
cessation
of
the
passive
resistance
of
the
experiences
a
very
unexpected
shock
to
the
unsmotherable
delight
of
all
the
porters
and
bystanders
upon
this
pickwick
smiles
with
great
and
drawing
a
shilling
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
begs
the
guard
as
he
picks
himself
out
of
the
boot
to
drink
his
health
in
a
glass
of
hot
at
which
the
guard
smiles
too
and
snodgrass
winkle
and
tupman
all
smile
in
company
the
guard
and
weller
disappear
for
five
minutes
most
probably
to
get
the
hot
for
they
smell
very
strongly
of
it
when
they
return
the
coachman
mounts
to
the
box
weller
jumps
up
behind
the
pickwickians
pull
their
coats
round
their
legs
and
their
shawls
over
their
noses
the
helpers
pull
the
off
the
coachman
shouts
out
a
cheery
all
right
and
away
they
go
they
have
rumbled
through
the
streets
and
jolted
over
the
stones
and
at
length
reach
the
wide
and
open
country
the
wheels
skim
over
the
hard
and
frosty
ground
and
the
horses
bursting
into
a
canter
at
a
smart
crack
of
the
whip
step
along
the
road
as
if
the
load
behind
them
coach
passengers
and
all
were
but
a
feather
at
their
heels
they
have
descended
a
gentle
slope
and
enter
upon
a
level
as
compact
and
dry
as
a
solid
block
of
marble
two
miles
long
another
crack
of
the
whip
and
on
they
speed
at
a
smart
gallop
the
horses
tossing
their
heads
and
rattling
the
harness
as
if
in
exhilaration
at
the
rapidity
of
the
motion
while
the
coachman
holding
whip
and
reins
in
one
hand
takes
off
his
hat
with
the
other
and
resting
it
on
his
knees
pulls
out
his
handkerchief
and
wipes
his
forehead
partly
because
he
has
a
habit
of
doing
it
and
partly
because
it
s
as
well
to
show
the
passengers
how
cool
he
is
and
what
an
easy
thing
it
is
to
drive
when
you
have
had
as
much
practice
as
he
has
having
done
this
very
leisurely
otherwise
the
effect
would
be
materially
impaired
he
replaces
his
handkerchief
pulls
on
his
hat
adjusts
his
gloves
squares
his
elbows
cracks
the
whip
again
and
on
they
speed
more
merrily
than
before
a
few
small
houses
scattered
on
either
side
of
the
road
betoken
the
entrance
to
some
town
or
village
the
lively
notes
of
the
guard
s
bugle
vibrate
in
the
clear
cold
air
and
wake
up
the
old
gentleman
inside
who
carefully
letting
down
the
and
standing
sentry
over
the
air
takes
a
short
peep
out
and
then
carefully
pulling
it
up
again
informs
the
other
inside
that
they
re
going
to
change
directly
on
which
the
other
inside
wakes
himself
up
and
determines
to
postpone
his
next
nap
until
after
the
stoppage
again
the
bugle
sounds
lustily
forth
and
rouses
the
cottager
s
wife
and
children
who
peep
out
at
the
house
door
and
watch
the
coach
till
it
turns
the
corner
when
they
once
more
crouch
round
the
blazing
fire
and
throw
on
another
log
of
wood
against
father
comes
home
while
father
himself
a
full
mile
off
has
just
exchanged
a
friendly
nod
with
the
coachman
and
turned
round
to
take
a
good
long
stare
at
the
vehicle
as
it
whirls
away
and
now
the
bugle
plays
a
lively
air
as
the
coach
rattles
through
the
streets
of
a
country
town
and
the
coachman
undoing
the
buckle
which
keeps
his
ribands
together
prepares
to
throw
them
off
the
moment
he
stops
pickwick
emerges
from
his
coat
collar
and
looks
about
him
with
great
curiosity
perceiving
which
the
coachman
informs
pickwick
of
the
name
of
the
town
and
tells
him
it
was
yesterday
both
of
which
pieces
of
information
pickwick
retails
to
his
whereupon
they
emerge
from
their
coat
collars
too
and
look
about
them
also
winkle
who
sits
at
the
extreme
edge
with
one
leg
dangling
in
the
air
is
nearly
precipitated
into
the
street
as
the
coach
twists
round
the
sharp
corner
by
the
cheesemonger
s
shop
and
turns
into
the
and
before
snodgrass
who
sits
next
to
him
has
recovered
from
his
alarm
they
pull
up
at
the
inn
yard
where
the
fresh
horses
with
cloths
on
are
already
waiting
the
coachman
throws
down
the
reins
and
gets
down
himself
and
the
other
outside
passengers
drop
down
also
except
those
who
have
no
great
confidence
in
their
ability
to
get
up
again
and
they
remain
where
they
are
and
stamp
their
feet
against
the
coach
to
warm
them
looking
with
longing
eyes
and
red
noses
at
the
bright
fire
in
the
inn
bar
and
the
sprigs
of
holly
with
red
berries
which
ornament
the
window
but
the
guard
has
delivered
at
the
s
shop
the
brown
paper
packet
he
took
out
of
the
little
pouch
which
hangs
over
his
shoulder
by
a
leathern
strap
and
has
seen
the
horses
carefully
put
to
and
has
thrown
on
the
pavement
the
saddle
which
was
brought
from
london
on
the
coach
roof
and
has
assisted
in
the
conference
between
the
coachman
and
the
hostler
about
the
gray
mare
that
hurt
her
off
last
tuesday
and
he
and
weller
are
all
right
behind
and
the
coachman
is
all
right
in
front
and
the
old
gentleman
inside
who
has
kept
the
window
down
full
two
inches
all
this
time
has
pulled
it
up
again
and
the
cloths
are
off
and
they
are
all
ready
for
starting
except
the
two
stout
gentlemen
whom
the
coachman
inquires
after
with
some
impatience
hereupon
the
coachman
and
the
guard
and
sam
weller
and
winkle
and
snodgrass
and
all
the
hostlers
and
every
one
of
the
idlers
who
are
more
in
number
than
all
the
others
put
together
shout
for
the
missing
gentlemen
as
loud
as
they
can
bawl
a
distant
response
is
heard
from
the
yard
and
pickwick
and
tupman
come
running
down
it
quite
out
of
breath
for
they
have
been
having
a
glass
of
ale
and
pickwick
s
fingers
are
so
cold
that
he
has
been
full
five
minutes
before
he
could
find
the
sixpence
to
pay
for
it
the
coachman
shouts
an
admonitory
now
then
gen
l
m
n
the
guard
it
the
old
gentleman
inside
thinks
it
a
very
extraordinary
thing
that
people
down
when
they
know
there
isn
t
time
for
it
pickwick
struggles
up
on
one
side
tupman
on
the
other
winkle
cries
all
right
and
off
they
start
shawls
are
pulled
up
coat
collars
are
readjusted
the
pavement
ceases
the
houses
disappear
and
they
are
once
again
dashing
along
the
open
road
with
the
fresh
clear
air
blowing
in
their
faces
and
gladdening
their
very
hearts
within
them
such
was
the
progress
of
pickwick
and
his
friends
by
the
muggleton
telegraph
on
their
way
to
dingley
dell
and
at
three
o
clock
that
afternoon
they
all
stood
high
and
dry
safe
and
sound
hale
and
hearty
upon
the
steps
of
the
blue
lion
having
taken
on
the
road
quite
enough
of
ale
and
brandy
to
enable
them
to
bid
defiance
to
the
frost
that
was
binding
up
the
earth
in
its
iron
fetters
and
weaving
its
beautiful
network
upon
the
trees
and
hedges
pickwick
was
busily
engaged
in
counting
the
barrels
of
oysters
and
superintending
the
disinterment
of
the
when
he
felt
himself
gently
pulled
by
the
skirts
of
the
coat
looking
round
he
discovered
that
the
individual
who
resorted
to
this
mode
of
catching
his
attention
was
no
other
than
wardle
s
favourite
page
better
known
to
the
readers
of
this
unvarnished
history
by
the
distinguishing
appellation
of
the
fat
boy
aha
said
pickwick
aha
said
the
fat
boy
as
he
said
it
he
glanced
from
the
to
the
and
chuckled
joyously
he
was
fatter
than
ever
well

rosy
enough
my
young
friend
said
pickwick
i
ve
been
asleep
right
in
front
of
the
taproom

replied
the
fat
boy
who
had
heated
himself
to
the
colour
of
a
new
in
the
course
of
an
hour

nap

but
he
thought

rather

a
cold
yes

said
pickwick
hastily
for
he
remembered
how
they
had
travelled
over
nearly
the
same
ground
on
a
previous
occasion
yes

would
rather
walk

sam

put
the
packages
into
the
cart
and
then

on
with
him
we
will
walk
forward
at
having
given
this
direction
and
settled
with
the
coachman
pickwick
and
his
three
friends
struck
into
the
footpath
across
the
fields
and
walked
briskly
away
leaving
weller
and
the
fat
boy
confronted
together
for
the
first
time
sam
looked
at
the
fat
boy
with
great
astonishment
but
without
saying
a
word
and
began
to
stow
the
luggage
rapidly
away
in
the
cart
while
the
fat
boy
stood
quietly
by
and
seemed
to
think
it
a
very
interesting
sort
of
thing
to
see
weller
working
by
himself
there
said
sam
throwing
in
the
last
there

said
the
fat
boy
in
a
very
satisfied
tone
there
they
vell
young

said
sam

nice
specimen
of
a
prize

nothin
on
your
mind
as

you
fret
yourself
have
you
inquired
sam
not
as
i
knows

replied
the
fat
boy
i
should
rayther
ha
thought
to
look
at
you
that
you
was
under
an
unrequited
attachment
to
some
young
ooman
said
sam
the
fat
boy
shook
his
head
vell
said
sam
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
do

ever

replied
the
boy
ah

sam

what
i
mean
is
should
you
like
a
drop
of

you
but

pose

the
boy
and
i
likes
a
drop
of
something
when
it
s
oh
you
do
do
you
said
sam
come
this
way
then
the
blue
lion
tap
was
soon
gained
and
the
fat
boy
swallowed
a
glass
of
liquor
without
so
much
as
winking
a
feat
which
considerably
advanced
him
in
weller
s
good
opinion
weller
having
transacted
a
similar
piece
of
business
on
his
own
account
they
got
into
the
cart
can
you
drive
said
the
fat
boy
i
should
rayther
think
so
replied
sam
there
then
said
the
fat
boy
putting
the
reins
in
his
hand
and
pointing
up
a
lane
it
s
as
straight
as
you
can
go
you
can
t
miss
with
these
words
the
fat
boy
laid
himself
affectionately
down
by
the
side
of
the
and
placing
an
under
his
head
for
a
pillow
fell
asleep
instantaneously
well
said
sam
of
all
the
cool
boys
ever
i
set
my
eyes
on
this
here
young
gen
l
m
n
is
the
coolest
come
wake
up
young
dropsy
but
as
young
dropsy
evinced
no
symptoms
of
returning
animation
sam
weller
sat
himself
down
in
front
of
the
cart
and
starting
the
old
horse
with
a
jerk
of
the
rein
jogged
steadily
on
towards
the
manor
farm
meanwhile
pickwick
and
his
friends
having
walked
their
blood
into
active
circulation
proceeded
cheerfully
on
the
paths
were
hard
the
grass
was
crisp
and
frosty
the
air
had
a
fine
dry
bracing
coldness
and
the
rapid
approach
of
the
gray
twilight
is
a
better
term
in
frosty
weather
made
them
look
forward
with
pleasant
anticipation
to
the
comforts
which
awaited
them
at
their
hospitable
entertainer
s
it
was
the
sort
of
afternoon
that
might
induce
a
couple
of
elderly
gentlemen
in
a
lonely
field
to
take
off
their
greatcoats
and
play
at
in
pure
lightness
of
heart
and
gaiety
and
we
firmly
believe
that
had
tupman
at
that
moment
proffered
a
back
pickwick
would
have
accepted
his
offer
with
the
utmost
avidity
however
tupman
did
not
volunteer
any
such
accommodation
and
the
friends
walked
on
conversing
merrily
as
they
turned
into
a
lane
they
had
to
cross
the
sound
of
many
voices
burst
upon
their
ears
and
before
they
had
even
had
time
to
form
a
guess
to
whom
they
belonged
they
walked
into
the
very
centre
of
the
party
who
were
expecting
their
arrival
a
fact
which
was
first
notified
to
the
pickwickians
by
the
loud
hurrah
which
burst
from
old
wardle
s
lips
when
they
appeared
in
sight
first
there
was
wardle
himself
looking
if
that
were
possible
more
jolly
than
ever
then
there
were
bella
and
her
faithful
trundle
and
lastly
there
were
emily
and
some
eight
or
ten
young
ladies
who
had
all
come
down
to
the
wedding
which
was
to
take
place
next
day
and
who
were
in
as
happy
and
important
a
state
as
young
ladies
usually
are
on
such
momentous
occasions
and
they
were
one
and
all
startling
the
fields
and
lanes
far
and
wide
with
their
frolic
and
laughter
the
ceremony
of
introduction
under
such
circumstances
was
very
soon
performed
or
we
should
rather
say
that
the
introduction
was
soon
over
without
any
ceremony
at
all
in
two
minutes
thereafter
pickwick
was
joking
with
the
young
ladies
who
wouldn
t
come
over
the
stile
while
he
looked
or
who
having
pretty
feet
and
unexceptionable
ankles
preferred
standing
on
the
top
rail
for
five
minutes
or
so
declaring
that
they
were
too
frightened
to
move
with
as
much
ease
and
absence
of
reserve
or
constraint
as
if
he
had
known
them
for
life
it
is
worthy
of
remark
too
that
snodgrass
offered
emily
far
more
assistance
than
the
absolute
terrors
of
the
stile
although
it
was
full
three
feet
high
and
had
only
a
couple
of
would
seem
to
require
while
one
young
lady
in
a
very
nice
little
pair
of
boots
with
fur
round
the
top
was
observed
to
scream
very
loudly
when
winkle
offered
to
help
her
over
all
this
was
very
snug
and
pleasant
and
when
the
difficulties
of
the
stile
were
at
last
surmounted
and
they
once
more
entered
on
the
open
field
old
wardle
informed
pickwick
how
they
had
all
been
down
in
a
body
to
inspect
the
furniture
and
of
the
house
which
the
young
couple
were
to
tenant
after
the
christmas
holidays
at
which
communication
bella
and
trundle
both
coloured
up
as
red
as
the
fat
boy
after
the
taproom
fire
and
the
young
lady
with
the
black
eyes
and
the
fur
round
the
boots
whispered
something
in
emily
s
ear
and
then
glanced
archly
at
snodgrass
to
which
emily
responded
that
she
was
a
foolish
girl
but
turned
very
red
notwithstanding
and
snodgrass
who
was
as
modest
as
all
great
geniuses
usually
are
felt
the
crimson
rising
to
the
crown
of
his
head
and
devoutly
wished
in
the
inmost
recesses
of
his
own
heart
that
the
young
lady
aforesaid
with
her
black
eyes
and
her
archness
and
her
boots
with
the
fur
round
the
top
were
all
comfortably
deposited
in
the
adjacent
county
but
if
they
were
social
and
happy
outside
the
house
what
was
the
warmth
and
cordiality
of
their
reception
when
they
reached
the
farm
the
very
servants
grinned
with
pleasure
at
sight
of
pickwick
and
emma
bestowed
a
and
look
of
recognition
on
tupman
which
was
enough
to
make
the
statue
of
bonaparte
in
the
passage
unfold
his
arms
and
clasp
her
within
them
the
old
lady
was
seated
with
customary
state
in
the
front
parlour
but
she
was
rather
cross
and
by
consequence
most
particularly
deaf
she
never
went
out
herself
and
like
a
great
many
other
old
ladies
of
the
same
stamp
she
was
apt
to
consider
it
an
act
of
domestic
treason
if
anybody
else
took
the
liberty
of
doing
what
she
couldn
t
so
bless
her
old
soul
she
sat
as
upright
as
she
could
in
her
great
chair
and
looked
as
fierce
as
might
be
and
that
was
benevolent
after
all
mother
said
wardle
mr
pickwick
you
recollect
him
never
mind
replied
the
old
lady
with
great
dignity
don
t
trouble
pickwick
about
an
old
creetur
like
me
nobody
cares
about
me
now
and
it
s
very
nat
ral
they
shouldn
here
the
old
lady
tossed
her
head
and
smoothed
down
her
silk
dress
with
trembling
hands
come
come
ma
am
said
pickwick
i
can
t
let
you
cut
an
old
friend
in
this
way
i
have
come
down
expressly
to
have
a
long
talk
and
another
rubber
with
you
and
we
ll
show
these
boys
and
girls
how
to
dance
a
minuet
before
they
re
hours
the
old
lady
was
rapidly
giving
way
but
she
did
not
like
to
do
it
all
at
once
so
she
only
said
ah
i
can
t
hear
him
nonsense
mother
said
wardle
come
come
don
t
be
cross
there
s
a
good
soul
recollect
bella
come
you
must
keep
her
spirits
up
poor
the
good
old
lady
heard
this
for
her
lip
quivered
as
her
son
said
it
but
age
has
its
little
infirmities
of
temper
and
she
was
not
quite
brought
round
yet
so
she
smoothed
down
the
dress
again
and
turning
to
pickwick
said
ah
pickwick
young
people
was
very
different
when
i
was
a
no
doubt
of
that
ma
am
said
pickwick
and
that
s
the
reason
why
i
would
make
much
of
the
few
that
have
any
traces
of
the
old
stock
and
saying
this
pickwick
gently
pulled
bella
towards
him
and
bestowing
a
kiss
upon
her
forehead
bade
her
sit
down
on
the
little
stool
at
her
grandmother
s
feet
whether
the
expression
of
her
countenance
as
it
was
raised
towards
the
old
lady
s
face
called
up
a
thought
of
old
times
or
whether
the
old
lady
was
touched
by
pickwick
s
affectionate
nature
or
whatever
was
the
cause
she
was
fairly
melted
so
she
threw
herself
on
her
granddaughter
s
neck
and
all
the
little
evaporated
in
a
gush
of
silent
tears
a
happy
party
they
were
that
night
sedate
and
solemn
were
the
score
of
rubbers
in
which
pickwick
and
the
old
lady
played
together
uproarious
was
the
mirth
of
the
round
table
long
after
the
ladies
had
retired
did
the
hot
elder
wine
well
qualified
with
brandy
and
spice
go
round
and
round
and
round
again
and
sound
was
the
sleep
and
pleasant
were
the
dreams
that
followed
it
is
a
remarkable
fact
that
those
of
snodgrass
bore
constant
reference
to
emily
wardle
and
that
the
principal
figure
in
winkle
s
visions
was
a
young
lady
with
black
eyes
and
arch
smile
and
a
pair
of
remarkably
nice
boots
with
fur
round
the
tops
pickwick
was
awakened
early
in
the
morning
by
a
hum
of
voices
and
a
pattering
of
feet
sufficient
to
rouse
even
the
fat
boy
from
his
heavy
slumbers
he
sat
up
in
bed
and
listened
the
female
servants
and
female
visitors
were
running
constantly
to
and
fro
and
there
were
such
multitudinous
demands
for
hot
water
such
repeated
outcries
for
needles
and
thread
and
so
many
entreaties
of
oh
do
come
and
tie
me
there
s
a
dear
that
pickwick
in
his
innocence
began
to
imagine
that
something
dreadful
must
have
occurred
when
he
grew
more
awake
and
remembered
the
wedding
the
occasion
being
an
important
one
he
dressed
himself
with
peculiar
care
and
descended
to
the
room
there
were
all
the
female
servants
in
a
bran
new
uniform
of
pink
muslin
gowns
with
white
bows
in
their
caps
running
about
the
house
in
a
state
of
excitement
and
agitation
which
it
would
be
impossible
to
describe
the
old
lady
was
dressed
out
in
a
brocaded
gown
which
had
not
seen
the
light
for
twenty
years
saving
and
excepting
such
truant
rays
as
had
stolen
through
the
chinks
in
the
box
in
which
it
had
been
laid
by
during
the
whole
time
trundle
was
in
high
feather
and
spirits
but
a
little
nervous
withal
the
hearty
old
landlord
was
trying
to
look
very
cheerful
and
unconcerned
but
failing
signally
in
the
attempt
all
the
girls
were
in
tears
and
white
muslin
except
a
select
two
or
three
who
were
being
honoured
with
a
private
view
of
the
bride
and
bridesmaids
upstairs
all
the
pickwickians
were
in
most
blooming
array
and
there
was
a
terrific
roaring
on
the
grass
in
front
of
the
house
occasioned
by
all
the
men
boys
and
hobbledehoys
attached
to
the
farm
each
of
whom
had
got
a
white
bow
in
his
and
all
of
whom
were
cheering
with
might
and
main
being
incited
thereto
and
stimulated
therein
by
the
precept
and
example
of
samuel
weller
who
had
managed
to
become
mighty
popular
already
and
was
as
much
at
home
as
if
he
had
been
born
on
the
land
a
wedding
is
a
licensed
subject
to
joke
upon
but
there
really
is
no
great
joke
in
the
matter
after
all
we
speak
merely
of
the
ceremony
and
beg
it
to
be
distinctly
understood
that
we
indulge
in
no
hidden
sarcasm
upon
a
married
life
mixed
up
with
the
pleasure
and
joy
of
the
occasion
are
the
many
regrets
at
quitting
home
the
tears
of
parting
between
parent
and
child
the
consciousness
of
leaving
the
dearest
and
kindest
friends
of
the
happiest
portion
of
human
life
to
encounter
its
cares
and
troubles
with
others
still
untried
and
little
known
natural
feelings
which
we
would
not
render
this
chapter
mournful
by
describing
and
which
we
should
be
still
more
unwilling
to
be
supposed
to
ridicule
let
us
briefly
say
then
that
the
ceremony
was
performed
by
the
old
clergyman
in
the
parish
church
of
dingley
dell
and
that
pickwick
s
name
is
attached
to
the
register
still
preserved
in
the
vestry
thereof
that
the
young
lady
with
the
black
eyes
signed
her
name
in
a
very
unsteady
and
tremulous
manner
that
emily
s
signature
as
the
other
bridesmaid
is
nearly
illegible
that
it
all
went
off
in
very
admirable
style
that
the
young
ladies
generally
thought
it
far
less
shocking
than
they
had
expected
and
that
although
the
owner
of
the
black
eyes
and
the
arch
smile
informed
wardle
that
she
was
sure
she
could
never
submit
to
anything
so
dreadful
we
have
the
very
best
reasons
for
thinking
she
was
mistaken
to
all
this
we
may
add
that
pickwick
was
the
first
who
saluted
the
bride
and
that
in
so
doing
he
threw
over
her
neck
a
rich
gold
watch
and
chain
which
no
mortal
eyes
but
the
jeweller
s
had
ever
beheld
before
then
the
old
church
bell
rang
as
gaily
as
it
could
and
they
all
returned
to
breakfast
vere
does
the
go
young
said
weller
to
the
fat
boy
as
he
assisted
in
laying
out
such
articles
of
consumption
as
had
not
been
duly
arranged
on
the
previous
night
the
fat
boy
pointed
to
the
destination
of
the
pies
wery
good
said
sam
stick
a
bit
o
christmas
in
em
t
other
dish
opposite
there
now
we
look
compact
and
comfortable
as
the
father
said
ven
he
cut
his
little
boy
s
head
off
to
cure
him
o
squintin
as
weller
made
the
comparison
he
fell
back
a
step
or
two
to
give
full
effect
to
it
and
surveyed
the
preparations
with
the
utmost
satisfaction
wardle
said
pickwick
almost
as
soon
as
they
were
all
seated
a
glass
of
wine
in
honour
of
this
happy
occasion
i
shall
be
delighted
my
boy
said
wardle
joe
damn
that
boy
he
s
gone
to
no
i
ain
t
sir
replied
the
fat
boy
starting
up
from
a
remote
corner
where
like
the
patron
saint
of
fat
boys
the
immortal
horner
he
had
been
devouring
a
christmas
pie
though
not
with
the
coolness
and
deliberation
which
characterised
that
young
gentleman
s
proceedings
fill
pickwick
s
yes
the
fat
boy
filled
pickwick
s
glass
and
then
retired
behind
his
master
s
chair
from
whence
he
watched
the
play
of
the
knives
and
forks
and
the
progress
of
the
choice
morsels
from
the
dishes
to
the
mouths
of
the
company
with
a
kind
of
dark
and
gloomy
joy
that
was
most
impressive
god
bless
you
old
fellow
said
pickwick
same
to
you
my
boy
replied
wardle
and
they
pledged
each
other
heartily
mrs
wardle
said
pickwick
we
old
folks
must
have
a
glass
of
wine
together
in
honour
of
this
joyful
the
old
lady
was
in
a
state
of
great
grandeur
just
then
for
she
was
sitting
at
the
top
of
the
table
in
the
brocaded
gown
with
her
married
granddaughter
on
one
side
and
pickwick
on
the
other
to
do
the
carving
pickwick
had
not
spoken
in
a
very
loud
tone
but
she
understood
him
at
once
and
drank
off
a
full
glass
of
wine
to
his
long
life
and
happiness
after
which
the
worthy
old
soul
launched
forth
into
a
minute
and
particular
account
of
her
own
wedding
with
a
dissertation
on
the
fashion
of
wearing
shoes
and
some
particulars
concerning
the
life
and
adventures
of
the
beautiful
lady
tollimglower
deceased
at
all
of
which
the
old
lady
herself
laughed
very
heartily
indeed
and
so
did
the
young
ladies
too
for
they
were
wondering
among
themselves
what
on
earth
grandma
was
talking
about
when
they
laughed
the
old
lady
laughed
ten
times
more
heartily
and
said
that
these
always
had
been
considered
capital
stories
which
caused
them
all
to
laugh
again
and
put
the
old
lady
into
the
very
best
of
humours
then
the
cake
was
cut
and
passed
through
the
ring
the
young
ladies
saved
pieces
to
put
under
their
pillows
to
dream
of
their
future
husbands
on
and
a
great
deal
of
blushing
and
merriment
was
thereby
occasioned
mr
miller
said
pickwick
to
his
old
acquaintance
the
gentleman
a
glass
of
wine
with
great
satisfaction
pickwick
replied
the
gentleman
solemnly
you
ll
take
me
in
said
the
benevolent
old
clergyman
and
me
interposed
his
wife
and
me
and
me
said
a
couple
of
poor
relations
at
the
bottom
of
the
table
who
had
eaten
and
drunk
very
heartily
and
laughed
at
everything
pickwick
expressed
his
heartfelt
delight
at
every
additional
suggestion
and
his
eyes
beamed
with
hilarity
and
cheerfulness
ladies
and
gentlemen
said
pickwick
suddenly
rising

excitement
of

feelings

all
the
servants
cried
old
wardle
interposing
to
prevent
the
public
rebuke
which
weller
would
otherwise
most
indubitably
have
received
from
his
master
give
them
a
glass
of
wine
each
to
drink
the
toast
in
now
amidst
the
silence
of
the
company
the
whispering
of
the
and
the
awkward
embarrassment
of
the
men
pickwick
proceeded
ladies
and
gentlemen
no

won
t
say
ladies
and
gentlemen
i
ll
call
you
my
friends
my
dear
friends
if
the
ladies
will
allow
me
to
take
so
great
a
liberty
here
pickwick
was
interrupted
by
immense
applause
from
the
ladies
echoed
by
the
gentlemen
during
which
the
owner
of
the
eyes
was
distinctly
heard
to
state
that
she
could
kiss
that
dear
pickwick
whereupon
winkle
gallantly
inquired
if
it
couldn
t
be
done
by
deputy
to
which
the
young
lady
with
the
black
eyes
replied
go
away
and
accompanied
the
request
with
a
look
which
said
as
plainly
as
a
look
could
do
if
you
my
dear
friends
resumed
pickwick
i
am
going
to
propose
the
health
of
the
bride

my
young

a
very
excellent
and
manly

his

a
very
amiable
and

girl
well
qualified

another
sphere
of
action
the
happiness
which
for
twenty
years
she
has
diffused
around
her
in
her
father

house
here

forth
into

blubberings
and

shall
not
be
suspected

latent
designs

enthusiastic
shouts
from
the

that

contemplation

pickwick
concluded
amidst
a
whirlwind
of
applause
and
once
more
were
the
lungs
of
the
supernumeraries
under
weller

command
brought
into
active
and
efficient
operation

winkle
all
was
happiness
and
festivity
until
the
mysterious
disappearance
of
both
the
poor
relations
beneath
the
table
warned
the
party
that
it
was
time
to
adjourn
at
dinner
they
met
again
after
a
mile
walk
undertaken
by
the
males
at
wardle
s
recommendation
to
get
rid
of
the
effects
of
the
wine
at
breakfast
the
poor
relations
had
kept
in
bed
all
day
with
the
view
of
attaining
the
same
happy
consummation
but
as
they
had
been
unsuccessful
they
stopped
there
weller
kept
the
domestics
in
a
state
of
perpetual
hilarity
and
the
fat
boy
divided
his
time
into
small
alternate
allotments
of
eating
and
sleeping
the
dinner
was
as
hearty
an
affair
as
the
breakfast
and
was
quite
as
noisy
without
the
tears
then
came
the
dessert
and
some
more
toasts
then
came
the
tea
and
coffee
and
then
the
ball
the
best
at
manor
farm
was
a
good
long
room
with
a
high
and
a
capacious
chimney
up
which
you
could
have
driven
one
of
the
new
patent
cabs
wheels
and
all
at
the
upper
end
of
the
room
seated
in
a
shady
bower
of
holly
and
evergreens
were
the
two
best
fiddlers
and
the
only
harp
in
all
muggleton
in
all
sorts
of
recesses
and
on
all
kinds
of
brackets
stood
massive
old
silver
candlesticks
with
four
branches
each
the
carpet
was
up
the
candles
burned
bright
the
fire
blazed
and
crackled
on
the
hearth
and
merry
voices
and
laughter
rang
through
the
room
if
any
of
the
old
english
yeomen
had
turned
into
fairies
when
they
died
it
was
just
the
place
in
which
they
would
have
held
their
revels
if
anything
could
have
added
to
the
interest
of
this
agreeable
scene
it
would
have
been
the
remarkable
fact
of
pickwick
s
appearing
without
his
gaiters
for
the
first
time
within
the
memory
of
his
oldest
friends
you
mean
to
dance
said
wardle
of
course
i
do
replied
pickwick
don
t
you
see
i
am
dressed
for
the
purpose
pickwick
called
attention
to
his
speckled
silk
stockings
and
smartly
tied
pumps
silk
stockings
exclaimed
tupman
jocosely
and
why
not
sir
why
not
said
pickwick
turning
warmly
upon
him
oh
of
course
there
is
no
reason
why
you
shouldn
t
wear
them
responded
tupman
i
imagine
not
sir
i
imagine
not
said
pickwick
in
a
very
peremptory
tone
tupman
had
contemplated
a
laugh
but
he
found
it
was
a
serious
matter
so
he
looked
grave
and
said
they
were
a
pretty
pattern
i
hope
they
are
said
pickwick
fixing
his
eyes
upon
his
friend
you
see
nothing
extraordinary
in
the
stockings
stockings
i
trust
sir
certainly
not
oh
certainly
not
replied
tupman
he
walked
away
and
pickwick
s
countenance
resumed
its
customary
benign
expression
we
are
all
ready
i
believe
said
pickwick
who
was
stationed
with
the
old
lady
at
the
top
of
the
dance
and
had
already
made
four
false
starts
in
his
excessive
anxiety
to
commence
then
begin
at
once
said
wardle
now
up
struck
the
two
fiddles
and
the
one
harp
and
off
went
pickwick
into
hands
across
when
there
was
a
general
clapping
of
hands
and
a
cry
of
stop
stop
what
s
the
matter
said
pickwick
who
was
only
brought
to
by
the
fiddles
and
harp
desisting
and
could
have
been
stopped
by
no
other
earthly
power
if
the
house
had
been
on
fire
where
s
arabella
allen
cried
a
dozen
voices
and
winkle
added
tupman
here
we
are
exclaimed
that
gentleman
emerging
with
his
pretty
companion
from
the
corner
as
he
did
so
it
would
have
been
hard
to
tell
which
was
the
redder
in
the
face
he
or
the
young
lady
with
the
black
eyes
what
an
extraordinary
thing
it
is
winkle
said
pickwick
rather
pettishly
that
you
couldn
t
have
taken
your
place
not
at
all
extraordinary
said
winkle
well
said
pickwick
with
a
very
expressive
smile
as
his
eyes
rested
on
arabella
well
i
don
t
know
that
it
either
after
however
there
was
no
time
to
think
more
about
the
matter
for
the
fiddles
and
harp
began
in
real
earnest
away
went
pickwick
hands
across
down
the
middle
to
the
very
end
of
the
room
and
up
the
chimney
back
again
to
the
door
poussette
everywhere
loud
stamp
on
the
ground
ready
for
the
next
couple
off
again
all
the
figure
over
once
more
another
stamp
to
beat
out
the
time
next
couple
and
the
next
and
the
next
again
never
was
such
going
at
last
after
they
had
reached
the
bottom
of
the
dance
and
full
fourteen
couple
after
the
old
lady
had
retired
in
an
exhausted
state
and
the
clergyman
s
wife
had
been
substituted
in
her
stead
did
that
gentleman
when
there
was
no
demand
whatever
on
his
exertions
keep
perpetually
dancing
in
his
place
to
keep
time
to
the
music
smiling
on
his
partner
all
the
while
with
a
blandness
of
demeanour
which
baffles
all
description
long
before
pickwick
was
weary
of
dancing
the
couple
had
retired
from
the
scene
there
was
a
glorious
supper
downstairs
notwithstanding
and
a
good
long
sitting
after
it
and
when
pickwick
awoke
late
the
next
morning
he
had
a
confused
recollection
of
having
severally
and
confidentially
invited
somewhere
about
people
to
dine
with
him
at
the
george
and
vulture
the
very
first
time
they
came
to
london
which
pickwick
rightly
considered
a
pretty
certain
indication
of
his
having
taken
something
besides
exercise
on
the
previous
night
and
so
your
family
has
games
in
the
kitchen
my
dear

they
inquired
sam
of
emma

leer
at

the

more

a
man
you

of

on
the
old
gen

n
as

inquired
the
fat
boy
in
a
faltering
voice
i

to
tell

replied
weller
he
was
one
o
the
largest
patterns
as

turned
out
reg
lar

man
as

caught
a
glimpse
of

emma

my
dear
said
weller
and

exact
model
of

to
his
office
with
a
wery
handsome
gold
hanging
out
about
a
foot
and
a
quarter
and
a
gold
watch
in
his
fob
pocket
as
was
worth
i
m
afraid
to
say
how
much
but
as
much
as
a
watch
can
be
a
large
heavy
round
manufacter
as
stout
for
a
watch
as
he
was
for
a
man
and
with
a
big
face
in
proportion
you
d
better
not
carry
that
ere

says
the
old
gen
l
m
n
s
friends
you

robbed
on
it
says
they
shall
i
says
he
yes
you

says
they

says
he
i

m
blessed
if

such
a
tight
fit
says
he
and
wenever
i
vants
to
know
what
s
o
clock
i
m
obliged
to
stare
into
the
bakers
shops
he
says
well
then
he
laughs
as
hearty
as
if
he
was
to
pieces
and
out
he
walks
agin
with
his
powdered
head
and
pigtail
and
rolls
down
the
strand
with
the
chain
hangin
out
furder
than
ever
and
the
great
round
watch
almost
bustin
through
his
gray
kersey
smalls
there
warn
t
a
pickpocket
in
all
london
as
didn
t
take
a
pull
at
that
chain
but
the
chain
ud
never
break
and
the
watch
ud
never
come
out
so
they
soon
got
tired
of
dragging
such
a
heavy
old
gen
l
m
n
along
the
pavement
and
he
d
go
home
and
laugh
till

pigtail
wibrated
like
the
penderlum
of
a
dutch
clock
at
last
one
day
the
old
gen
l
m
n
was
along
and
he
sees
a
pickpocket

sight
up
arm
in
arm
with
a
little
boy
with
a
wery
large
head
here

a
game
says
the
old
gen
l
m
n
to
himself
they
re
to
have
another
try
but
it
won
t
do
so
he
begins
chucklin
wery
hearty
wen
all
of
a
sudden
the
little
boy
leaves
hold
of
the
pickpocket
s
arm
and
rushes
head
foremost
straight
into
the
old
gen

m
n
s
stomach
and
for
a
moment
doubles
him
right
up
with

pain

the
old

all
right
sir
says
the
pickpocket
in
his
ear
and
wen

agin

watch
and

gone
and
what

worse
than

was
all
wrong
ever
afterwards
to
the
wery
last
day
of
his
life
so
just
you
look
about
you
young
feller
and
take
care
you
don
t
get
too
as
weller
concluded
this
moral
tale
with
which
the
fat
boy
appeared
much
affected
they
all
three
repaired
to
the
large
kitchen
in
which
the
family
were
by
this
time
assembled
according
to
annual
custom
on
christmas
eve
observed
by
old
wardle
s
forefathers
from
time
immemorial
from
the
centre
of
the
ceiling
of
this
kitchen
old
wardle
had
just
suspended
with
his
own
hands
a
huge
branch
of
mistletoe
and
this
same
branch
of
mistletoe
instantaneously
gave
rise
to
a
scene
of
general
and
most
delightful
struggling
and
confusion
in
the
midst
of
which
pickwick
with
a
gallantry
that
would
have
done
honour
to
a
descendant
of
lady
tollimglower
herself
took
the
old
lady
by
the
hand
led
her
beneath
the
mystic
branch
and
saluted
her
in
all
courtesy
and
decorum
the
old
lady
submitted
to
this
piece
of
practical
politeness
with
all
the
dignity
which
befitted
so
important
and
serious
a
solemnity
but
the
younger
ladies
not
being
so
thoroughly
imbued
with
a
superstitious
veneration
for
the
custom
or
imagining
that
the
value
of
a
salute
is
very
much
enhanced
if
it
cost
a
little
trouble
to
obtain
it
screamed
and
struggled
and
ran
into
corners
and
threatened
and
remonstrated
and
did
everything
but
leave
the
room
until
some
of
the
less
adventurous
gentlemen
were
on
the
point
of
desisting
when
they
all
at
once
found
it
useless
to
resist
any
longer
and
submitted
to
be
kissed
with
a
good
grace
winkle
kissed
the
young
lady
with
the
black
eyes
and
snodgrass
kissed
emily
and
weller
not
being
particular
about
the
form
of
being
under
the
mistletoe
kissed
emma
and
the
other
female
servants
just
as
he
caught
them
as
to
the
poor
relations
they
kissed
everybody
not
even
excepting
the
plainer
portions
of
the
young
lady
visitors
who
in
their
excessive
confusion
ran
right
under
the
mistletoe
as
soon
as
it
was
hung
up
without
knowing
it
wardle
stood
with
his
back
to
the
fire
surveying
the
whole
scene
with
the
utmost
satisfaction
and
the
fat
boy
took
the
opportunity
of
appropriating
to
his
own
use
and
summarily
devouring
a
particularly
fine
that
had
been
carefully
put
by
for
somebody
else
now
the
screaming
had
subsided
and
faces
were
in
a
glow
and
curls
in
a
tangle
and
pickwick
after
kissing
the
old
lady
as
before
mentioned
was
standing
under
the
mistletoe
looking
with
a
very
pleased
countenance
on
all
that
was
passing
around
him
when
the
young
lady
with
the
black
eyes
after
a
little
whispering
with
the
other
young
ladies
made
a
sudden
dart
forward
and
putting
her
arm
round
pickwick
s
neck
saluted
him
affectionately
on
the
left
cheek
and
before
pickwick
distinctly
knew
what
was
the
matter
he
was
surrounded
by
the
whole
body
and
kissed
by
every
one
of
them
it
was
a
pleasant
thing
to
see
pickwick
in
the
centre
of
the
group
now
pulled
this
way
and
then
that
and
first
kissed
on
the
chin
and
then
on
the
nose
and
then
on
the
spectacles
and
to
hear
the
peals
of
laughter
which
were
raised
on
every
side
but
it
was
a
still
more
pleasant
thing
to
see
pickwick
blinded
shortly
afterwards
with
a
silk
handkerchief
falling
up
against
the
wall
and
scrambling
into
corners
and
going
through
all
the
mysteries
of
s
buff
with
the
utmost
relish
for
the
game
until
at
last
he
caught
one
of
the
poor
relations
and
then
had
to
evade
the
himself
which
he
did
with
a
nimbleness
and
agility
that
elicited
the
admiration
and
applause
of
all
beholders
the
poor
relations
caught
the
people
who
they
thought
would
like
it
and
when
the
game
flagged
got
caught
themselves
when
they
all
tired
of
s
buff
there
was
a
great
game
at
dragon
and
when
fingers
enough
were
burned
with
that
and
all
the
raisins
were
gone
they
sat
down
by
the
huge
fire
of
blazing
logs
to
a
substantial
supper
and
a
mighty
bowl
of
wassail
something
smaller
than
an
ordinary
copper
in
which
the
hot
apples
were
hissing
and
bubbling
with
a
rich
look
and
a
jolly
sound
that
were
perfectly
irresistible
this
said
pickwick
looking
round
him
this
is
indeed
our
invariable
custom
replied
wardle
everybody
sits
down
with
us
on
christmas
eve
as
you
see
them
now
servants
and
all
and
here
we
wait
until
the
clock
strikes
twelve
to
usher
christmas
in
and
beguile
the
time
with
forfeits
and
old
stories
trundle
my
boy
rake
up
the
up
flew
the
bright
sparks
in
myriads
as
the
logs
were
stirred
the
deep
red
blaze
sent
forth
a
rich
glow
that
penetrated
into
the
farthest
corner
of
the
room
and
cast
its
cheerful
tint
on
every
face
come
said
wardle
a
song
a
christmas
song
i
ll
give
you
one
in
default
of
a
bravo
said
pickwick
fill
up
cried
wardle
it
will
be
two
hours
good
before
you
see
the
bottom
of
the
bowl
through
the
deep
rich
colour
of
the
wassail
fill
up
all
round
and
now
for
the
thus
saying
the
merry
old
gentleman
in
a
good
round
sturdy
voice
commenced
without
more
ado
a
christmas
carol
i
care
not
for
spring
on
his
fickle
wing
let
the
blossoms
and
buds
be
borne
he
woos
them
amain
with
his
treacherous
rain
and
he
scatters
them
ere
the
morn
an
inconstant
elf
he
knows
not
himself
nor
his
own
changing
mind
an
hour
he
ll
smile
in
your
face
and
with
wry
grimace
he
ll
wither
your
youngest
flower
let
the
summer
sun
to
his
bright
home
run
he
shall
never
be
sought
by
me
when
he
s
dimmed
by
a
cloud
i
can
laugh
aloud
and
care
not
how
sulky
he
be
for
his
darling
child
is
the
madness
wild
that
sports
in
fierce
fever
s
train
and
when
love
is
too
strong
it
don
t
last
long
as
many
have
found
to
their
pain
a
mild
harvest
night
by
the
tranquil
light
of
the
modest
and
gentle
moon
has
a
far
sweeter
sheen
for
me
i
ween
than
the
broad
and
unblushing
noon
but
every
leaf
awakens
my
grief
as
it
lieth
beneath
the
tree
so
let
autumn
air
be
never
so
fair
it
by
no
means
agrees
with
me
but
my
song
i
troll
out
for
the
hearty
the
true
and
the
bold
a
bumper
i
drain
and
with
might
and
main
give
three
cheers
for
this
christmas
old
we
ll
usher
him
in
with
a
merry
din
that
shall
gladden
his
joyous
heart
and
we
ll
keep
him
up
while
there
s
bite
or
sup
and
in
fellowship
good
we
ll
part
in
his
fine
honest
pride
he
scorns
to
hide
one
jot
of
his
scars
they
re
no
disgrace
for
there
s
much
the
same
trace
on
the
cheeks
of
our
bravest
tars
then
again
i
sing
till
the
roof
doth
ring
and
it
echoes
from
wall
to
wall
to
the
stout
old
wight
fair
welcome
as
the
king
of
the
seasons
all
this
song
was
tumultuously
applauded
for
friends
and
dependents
make
a
capital
audience
and
the
poor
relations
especially
were
in
perfect
ecstasies
of
rapture
again
was
the
fire
replenished
and
again
went
the
wassail
round
how
it
snows
said
one
of
the
men
in
a
low
tone
snows
does
it
said
wardle
rough
cold
night
sir
replied
the
man
and
there
s
a
wind
got
up
that
drifts
it
across
the
fields
in
a
thick
white
what
does
jem
say
inquired
the
old
lady
there
ain
t
anything
the
matter
is
there
no
no
mother
replied
wardle
he
says
there
s
a
snowdrift
and
a
wind
that
s
piercing
cold
i
should
know
that
by
the
way
it
rumbles
in
the
ah
said
the
old
lady
there
was
just
such
a
wind
and
just
such
a
fall
of
snow
a
good
many
years
back
i
recollect
just
five
years
before
your
poor
father
died
it
was
a
christmas
eve
too
and
i
remember
that
on
that
very
night
he
told
us
the
story
about
the
goblins
that
carried
away
old
gabriel
the
story
about
what
said
pickwick
oh
nothing
nothing
replied
wardle
about
an
old
sexton
that
the
good
people
down
here
suppose
to
have
been
carried
away
by
suppose
ejaculated
the
old
lady
is
there
anybody
hardy
enough
to
disbelieve
it
suppose
haven
t
you
heard
ever
since
you
were
a
child
that
he
away
by
the
goblins
and
don
t
you
know
he
was
very
well
mother
he
was
if
you
like
said
wardle
laughing
he
carried
away
by
goblins
pickwick
and
there
s
an
end
of
the
no
no
said
pickwick
not
an
end
of
it
i
assure
you
for
i
must
hear
how
and
why
and
all
about
wardle
smiled
as
every
head
was
bent
forward
to
hear
and
filling
out
the
wassail
with
no
stinted
hand
nodded
a
health
to
pickwick
and
began
as
follows
but
bless
our
editorial
heart
what
a
long
chapter
we
have
been
betrayed
into
we
had
quite
forgotten
all
such
petty
restrictions
as
chapters
we
solemnly
declare
so
here
goes
to
give
the
goblin
a
fair
start
in
a
new
one
a
clear
stage
and
no
favour
for
the
goblins
ladies
and
gentlemen
if
you
please
chapter
xxix
the
story
of
the
goblins
who
stole
a
sexton
in
an
old
abbey
town
down
in
this
part
of
the
country
a
long
long
while
ago
so
long
that
the
story
must
be
a
true
one
because
our
implicitly
believed
it
there
officiated
as
sexton
and
in
the
churchyard
one
gabriel
grub
it
by
no
means
follows
that
because
a
man
is
a
sexton
and
constantly
surrounded
by
the
emblems
of
mortality
therefore
he
should
be
a
morose
and
melancholy
man
your
undertakers
are
the
merriest
fellows
in
the
world
and
i
once
had
the
honour
of
being
on
intimate
terms
with
a
mute
who
in
private
life
and
off
duty
was
as
comical
and
jocose
a
little
fellow
as
ever
chirped
out
a
song
without
a
hitch
in
his
memory
or
drained
off
a
good
stiff
glass
without
stopping
for
breath
but
notwithstanding
these
precedents
to
the
contrary
gabriel
grub
was
an
surly
fellow
a
morose
and
lonely
man
who
consorted
with
nobody
but
himself
and
an
old
wicker
bottle
which
fitted
into
his
large
deep
waistcoat
pocket
and
who
eyed
each
merry
face
as
it
passed
him
by
with
such
a
deep
scowl
of
malice
and
humour
as
it
was
difficult
to
meet
without
feeling
something
the
worse
for
a
little
before
twilight
one
christmas
eve
gabriel
shouldered
his
spade
lighted
his
lantern
and
betook
himself
towards
the
old
churchyard
for
he
had
got
a
grave
to
finish
by
next
morning
and
feeling
very
low
he
thought
it
might
raise
his
spirits
perhaps
if
he
went
on
with
his
work
at
once
as
he
went
his
way
up
the
ancient
street
he
saw
the
cheerful
light
of
the
blazing
fires
gleam
through
the
old
casements
and
heard
the
loud
laugh
and
the
cheerful
shouts
of
those
who
were
assembled
around
them
he
marked
the
bustling
preparations
for
next
day
s
cheer
and
smelled
the
numerous
savoury
odours
consequent
thereupon
as
they
steamed
up
from
the
kitchen
windows
in
clouds
all
this
was
gall
and
wormwood
to
the
heart
of
gabriel
grub
and
when
groups
of
children
bounded
out
of
the
houses
tripped
across
the
road
and
were
met
before
they
could
knock
at
the
opposite
door
by
half
a
dozen
little
rascals
who
crowded
round
them
as
they
flocked
upstairs
to
spend
the
evening
in
their
christmas
games
gabriel
smiled
grimly
and
clutched
the
handle
of
his
spade
with
a
firmer
grasp
as
he
thought
of
measles
scarlet
fever
thrush
and
a
good
many
other
sources
of
consolation
besides
in
this
happy
frame
of
mind
gabriel
strode
along
returning
a
short
sullen
growl
to
the
greetings
of
such
of
his
neighbours
as
now
and
then
passed
him
until
he
turned
into
the
dark
lane
which
led
to
the
churchyard
now
gabriel
had
been
looking
forward
to
reaching
the
dark
lane
because
it
was
generally
speaking
a
nice
gloomy
mournful
place
into
which
the
townspeople
did
not
much
care
to
go
except
in
broad
daylight
and
when
the
sun
was
shining
consequently
he
was
not
a
little
indignant
to
hear
a
young
urchin
roaring
out
some
jolly
song
about
a
merry
christmas
in
this
very
sanctuary
which
had
been
called
coffin
lane
ever
since
the
days
of
the
old
abbey
and
the
time
of
the
monks
as
gabriel
walked
on
and
the
voice
drew
nearer
he
found
it
proceeded
from
a
small
boy
who
was
hurrying
along
to
join
one
of
the
little
parties
in
the
old
street
and
who
partly
to
keep
himself
company
and
partly
to
prepare
himself
for
the
occasion
was
shouting
out
the
song
at
the
highest
pitch
of
his
lungs
so
gabriel
waited
until
the
boy
came
up
and
then
dodged
him
into
a
corner
and
rapped
him
over
the
head
with
his
lantern
five
or
six
times
just
to
teach
him
to
modulate
his
voice
and
as
the
boy
hurried
away
with
his
hand
to
his
head
singing
quite
a
different
sort
of
tune
gabriel
grub
chuckled
very
heartily
to
himself
and
entered
the
churchyard
locking
the
gate
behind
him
he
took
off
his
coat
set
down
his
lantern
and
getting
into
the
unfinished
grave
worked
at
it
for
an
hour
or
so
with
right
but
the
earth
was
hardened
with
the
frost
and
it
was
no
very
easy
matter
to
break
it
up
and
shovel
it
out
and
although
there
was
a
moon
it
was
a
very
young
one
and
shed
little
light
upon
the
grave
which
was
in
the
shadow
of
the
church
at
any
other
time
these
obstacles
would
have
made
gabriel
grub
very
moody
and
miserable
but
he
was
so
well
pleased
with
having
stopped
the
small
boy
s
singing
that
he
took
little
heed
of
the
scanty
progress
he
had
made
and
looked
down
into
the
grave
when
he
had
finished
work
for
the
night
with
grim
satisfaction
murmuring
as
he
gathered
up
his
things
brave
lodgings
for
one
brave
lodgings
for
one
a
few
feet
of
cold
earth
when
life
is
done
a
stone
at
the
head
a
stone
at
the
feet
a
rich
juicy
meal
for
the
worms
to
eat
rank
grass
overhead
and
damp
clay
around
brave
lodgings
for
one
these
in
holy
ground
ho
ho
laughed
gabriel
grub
as
he
sat
himself
down
on
a
flat
tombstone
which
was
a
favourite
of
his
and
drew
forth
his
wicker
bottle
a
coffin
at
christmas
a
christmas
box
ho
ho
ho
ho
ho
ho
repeated
a
voice
which
sounded
close
behind
him
gabriel
paused
in
some
alarm
in
the
act
of
raising
the
wicker
bottle
to
his
lips
and
looked
round
the
bottom
of
the
oldest
grave
about
him
was
not
more
still
and
quiet
than
the
churchyard
in
the
pale
moonlight
the
cold
hoar
frost
glistened
on
the
tombstones
and
sparkled
like
rows
of
gems
among
the
stone
carvings
of
the
old
church
the
snow
lay
hard
and
crisp
upon
the
ground
and
spread
over
the
mounds
of
earth
so
white
and
smooth
a
cover
that
it
seemed
as
if
corpses
lay
there
hidden
only
by
their
winding
sheets
not
the
faintest
rustle
broke
the
profound
tranquillity
of
the
solemn
scene
sound
itself
appeared
to
be
frozen
up
all
was
so
cold
and
still
it
was
the
echoes
said
gabriel
grub
raising
the
bottle
to
his
lips
again
it
was
said
a
deep
voice
gabriel
started
up
and
stood
rooted
to
the
spot
with
astonishment
and
terror
for
his
eyes
rested
on
a
form
that
made
his
blood
run
cold
seated
on
an
upright
tombstone
close
to
him
was
a
strange
unearthly
figure
whom
gabriel
felt
at
once
was
no
being
of
this
world
his
long
fantastic
legs
which
might
have
reached
the
ground
were
cocked
up
and
crossed
after
a
quaint
fantastic
fashion
his
sinewy
arms
were
bare
and
his
hands
rested
on
his
knees
on
his
short
round
body
he
wore
a
close
covering
ornamented
with
small
slashes
a
short
cloak
dangled
at
his
back
the
collar
was
cut
into
curious
peaks
which
served
the
goblin
in
lieu
of
ruff
or
neckerchief
and
his
shoes
curled
up
at
his
toes
into
long
points
on
his
head
he
wore
a
hat
garnished
with
a
single
feather
the
hat
was
covered
with
the
white
frost
and
the
goblin
looked
as
if
he
had
sat
on
the
same
tombstone
very
comfortably
for
two
or
three
hundred
years
he
was
sitting
perfectly
still
his
tongue
was
put
out
as
if
in
derision
and
he
was
grinning
at
gabriel
grub
with
such
a
grin
as
only
a
goblin
could
call
up
it
was
echoes
said
the
goblin
gabriel
grub
was
paralysed
and
could
make
no
reply
what
do
you
do
here
on
christmas
eve
said
the
goblin
sternly
i
came
to
dig
a
grave
sir
stammered
gabriel
grub
what
man
wanders
among
graves
and
churchyards
on
such
a
night
as
this
cried
the
goblin
gabriel
grub
gabriel
grub
screamed
a
wild
chorus
of
voices
that
seemed
to
fill
the
churchyard
gabriel
looked
fearfully
round
nothing
was
to
be
seen
what
have
you
got
in
that
bottle
said
the
goblin
hollands
sir
replied
the
sexton
trembling
more
than
ever
for
he
had
bought
it
of
the
smugglers
and
he
thought
that
perhaps
his
questioner
might
be
in
the
excise
department
of
the
goblins
who
drinks
hollands
alone
and
in
a
churchyard
on
such
a
night
as
this
said
the
goblin
gabriel
grub
gabriel
grub
exclaimed
the
wild
voices
again
the
goblin
leered
maliciously
at
the
terrified
sexton
and
then
raising
his
voice
exclaimed
and
who
then
is
our
fair
and
lawful
prize
to
this
inquiry
the
invisible
chorus
replied
in
a
strain
that
sounded
like
the
voices
of
many
choristers
singing
to
the
mighty
swell
of
the
old
church
organ
a
strain
that
seemed
borne
to
the
sexton
s
ears
upon
a
wild
wind
and
to
die
away
as
it
passed
onward
but
the
burden
of
the
reply
was
still
the
same
gabriel
grub
gabriel
grub
the
goblin
grinned
a
broader
grin
than
before
as
he
said
well
gabriel
what
do
you
say
to
this
the
sexton
gasped
for
breath
what
do
you
think
of
this
gabriel
said
the
goblin
kicking
up
his
feet
in
the
air
on
either
side
of
the
tombstone
and
looking
at
the
points
with
as
much
complacency
as
if
he
had
been
contemplating
the
most
fashionable
pair
of
wellingtons
in
all
bond
street
it
s
it
s
very
curious
sir
replied
the
sexton
half
dead
with
fright
very
curious
and
very
pretty
but
i
think
i
ll
go
back
and
finish
my
work
sir
if
you
work
said
the
goblin
what
work
the
grave
sir
making
the
grave
stammered
the
sexton
oh
the
grave
eh
said
the
goblin
who
makes
graves
at
a
time
when
all
other
men
are
merry
and
takes
a
pleasure
in
it
again
the
mysterious
voices
replied
gabriel
grub
gabriel
grub
i
am
afraid
my
friends
want
you
gabriel
said
the
goblin
thrusting
his
tongue
farther
into
his
cheek
than
ever
and
a
most
astonishing
tongue
it
was
i
m
afraid
my
friends
want
you
gabriel
said
the
goblin
under
favour
sir
replied
the
sexton
i
don
t
think
they
can
sir
they
don
t
know
me
sir
i
don
t
think
the
gentlemen
have
ever
seen
me
oh
yes
they
have
replied
the
goblin
we
know
the
man
with
the
sulky
face
and
grim
scowl
that
came
down
the
street
throwing
his
evil
looks
at
the
children
and
grasping
his
the
tighter
we
know
the
man
who
struck
the
boy
in
the
envious
malice
of
his
heart
because
the
boy
could
be
merry
and
he
could
not
we
know
him
we
know
here
the
goblin
gave
a
loud
shrill
laugh
which
the
echoes
returned
twentyfold
and
throwing
his
legs
up
in
the
air
stood
upon
his
head
or
rather
upon
the
very
point
of
his
hat
on
the
narrow
edge
of
the
tombstone
whence
he
threw
a
somerset
with
extraordinary
agility
right
to
the
sexton
s
feet
at
which
he
planted
himself
in
the
attitude
in
which
tailors
generally
sit
upon
the
i
i
am
afraid
i
must
leave
you
sir
said
the
sexton
making
an
effort
to
move
leave
us
said
the
goblin
gabriel
grub
going
to
leave
us
ho
ho
ho
as
the
goblin
laughed
the
sexton
observed
for
one
instant
a
brilliant
illumination
within
the
windows
of
the
church
as
if
the
whole
building
were
lighted
up
it
disappeared
the
organ
pealed
forth
a
lively
air
and
whole
troops
of
goblins
the
very
counterpart
of
the
first
one
poured
into
the
churchyard
and
began
playing
at
with
the
tombstones
never
stopping
for
an
instant
to
take
breath
but
overing
the
highest
among
them
one
after
the
other
with
the
most
marvellous
dexterity
the
first
goblin
was
a
most
astonishing
leaper
and
none
of
the
others
could
come
near
him
even
in
the
extremity
of
his
terror
the
sexton
could
not
help
observing
that
while
his
friends
were
content
to
leap
over
the
gravestones
the
first
one
took
the
family
vaults
iron
railings
and
all
with
as
much
ease
as
if
they
had
been
so
many
at
last
the
game
reached
to
a
most
exciting
pitch
the
organ
played
quicker
and
quicker
and
the
goblins
leaped
faster
and
faster
coiling
themselves
up
rolling
head
over
heels
upon
the
ground
and
bounding
over
the
tombstones
like
footballs
the
sexton
s
brain
whirled
round
with
the
rapidity
of
the
motion
he
beheld
and
his
legs
reeled
beneath
him
as
the
spirits
flew
before
his
eyes
when
the
goblin
king
suddenly
darting
towards
him
laid
his
hand
upon
his
collar
and
sank
with
him
through
the
earth
when
gabriel
grub
had
had
time
to
fetch
his
breath
which
the
rapidity
of
his
descent
had
for
the
moment
taken
away
he
found
himself
in
what
appeared
to
be
a
large
cavern
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
crowds
of
goblins
ugly
and
grim
in
the
centre
of
the
room
on
an
elevated
seat
was
stationed
his
friend
of
the
churchyard
and
close
behind
him
stood
gabriel
grub
himself
without
power
of
motion
cold
said
the
king
of
the
goblins
very
cold
a
glass
of
something
warm
here
at
this
command
half
a
dozen
officious
goblins
with
a
perpetual
smile
upon
their
faces
whom
gabriel
grub
imagined
to
be
courtiers
on
that
account
hastily
disappeared
and
presently
returned
with
a
goblet
of
liquid
fire
which
they
presented
to
the
king
ah
cried
the
goblin
whose
cheeks
and
throat
were
transparent
as
he
tossed
down
the
flame
this
warms
one
indeed
bring
a
bumper
of
the
same
for
it
was
in
vain
for
the
unfortunate
sexton
to
protest
that
he
was
not
in
the
habit
of
taking
anything
warm
at
night
one
of
the
goblins
held
him
while
another
poured
the
blazing
liquid
down
his
throat
the
whole
assembly
screeched
with
laughter
as
he
coughed
and
choked
and
wiped
away
the
tears
which
gushed
plentifully
from
his
eyes
after
swallowing
the
burning
draught
and
now
said
the
king
fantastically
poking
the
taper
corner
of
his
hat
into
the
sexton
s
eye
and
thereby
occasioning
him
the
most
exquisite
pain
and
now
show
the
man
of
misery
and
gloom
a
few
of
the
pictures
from
our
own
great
storehouse
as
the
goblin
said
this
a
thick
cloud
which
obscured
the
remoter
end
of
the
cavern
rolled
gradually
away
and
disclosed
apparently
at
a
great
distance
a
small
and
scantily
furnished
but
neat
and
clean
apartment
a
crowd
of
little
children
were
gathered
round
a
bright
fire
clinging
to
their
mother
s
gown
and
gambolling
around
her
chair
the
mother
occasionally
rose
and
drew
aside
the
as
if
to
look
for
some
expected
object
a
frugal
meal
was
ready
spread
upon
the
table
and
an
elbow
chair
was
placed
near
the
fire
a
knock
was
heard
at
the
door
the
mother
opened
it
and
the
children
crowded
round
her
and
clapped
their
hands
for
joy
as
their
father
entered
he
was
wet
and
weary
and
shook
the
snow
from
his
garments
as
the
children
crowded
round
him
and
seizing
his
cloak
hat
stick
and
gloves
with
busy
zeal
ran
with
them
from
the
room
then
as
he
sat
down
to
his
meal
before
the
fire
the
children
climbed
about
his
knee
and
the
mother
sat
by
his
side
and
all
seemed
happiness
and
comfort
but
a
change
came
upon
the
view
almost
imperceptibly
the
scene
was
altered
to
a
small
bedroom
where
the
fairest
and
youngest
child
lay
dying
the
roses
had
fled
from
his
cheek
and
the
light
from
his
eye
and
even
as
the
sexton
looked
upon
him
with
an
interest
he
had
never
felt
or
known
before
he
died
his
young
brothers
and
sisters
crowded
round
his
little
bed
and
seized
his
tiny
hand
so
cold
and
heavy
but
they
shrank
back
from
its
touch
and
looked
with
awe
on
his
infant
face
for
calm
and
tranquil
as
it
was
and
sleeping
in
rest
and
peace
as
the
beautiful
child
seemed
to
be
they
saw
that
he
was
dead
and
they
knew
that
he
was
an
angel
looking
down
upon
and
blessing
them
from
a
bright
and
happy
heaven
again
the
light
cloud
passed
across
the
picture
and
again
the
subject
changed
the
father
and
mother
were
old
and
helpless
now
and
the
number
of
those
about
them
was
diminished
more
than
half
but
content
and
cheerfulness
sat
on
every
face
and
beamed
in
every
eye
as
they
crowded
round
the
fireside
and
told
and
listened
to
old
stories
of
earlier
and
bygone
days
slowly
and
peacefully
the
father
sank
into
the
grave
and
soon
after
the
sharer
of
all
his
cares
and
troubles
followed
him
to
a
place
of
rest
the
few
who
yet
survived
them
kneeled
by
their
tomb
and
watered
the
green
turf
which
covered
it
with
their
tears
then
rose
and
turned
away
sadly
and
mournfully
but
not
with
bitter
cries
or
despairing
lamentations
for
they
knew
that
they
should
one
day
meet
again
and
once
more
they
mixed
with
the
busy
world
and
their
content
and
cheerfulness
were
restored
the
cloud
settled
upon
the
picture
and
concealed
it
from
the
sexton
s
view
what
do
you
think
of
said
the
goblin
turning
his
large
face
towards
gabriel
grub
gabriel
murmured
out
something
about
its
being
very
pretty
and
looked
somewhat
ashamed
as
the
goblin
bent
his
fiery
eyes
upon
him
you
a
miserable
man
said
the
goblin
in
a
tone
of
excessive
contempt
you
he
appeared
disposed
to
add
more
but
indignation
choked
his
utterance
so
he
lifted
up
one
of
his
very
pliable
legs
and
flourishing
it
above
his
head
a
little
to
insure
his
aim
administered
a
good
sound
kick
to
gabriel
grub
immediately
after
which
all
the
goblins
in
waiting
crowded
round
the
wretched
sexton
and
kicked
him
without
mercy
according
to
the
established
and
invariable
custom
of
courtiers
upon
earth
who
kick
whom
royalty
kicks
and
hug
whom
royalty
hugs
show
him
some
more
said
the
king
of
the
goblins
at
these
words
the
cloud
was
dispelled
and
a
rich
and
beautiful
landscape
was
disclosed
to
view
there
is
just
such
another
to
this
day
within
half
a
mile
of
the
old
abbey
town
the
sun
shone
from
out
the
clear
blue
sky
the
water
sparkled
beneath
his
rays
and
the
trees
looked
greener
and
the
flowers
more
gay
beneath
its
cheering
influence
the
water
rippled
on
with
a
pleasant
sound
the
trees
rustled
in
the
light
wind
that
murmured
among
their
leaves
the
birds
sang
upon
the
boughs
and
the
lark
carolled
on
high
her
welcome
to
the
morning
yes
it
was
morning
the
bright
balmy
morning
of
summer
the
minutest
leaf
the
smallest
blade
of
grass
was
instinct
with
life
the
ant
crept
forth
to
her
daily
toil
the
butterfly
fluttered
and
basked
in
the
warm
rays
of
the
sun
myriads
of
insects
spread
their
transparent
wings
and
revelled
in
their
brief
but
happy
existence
man
walked
forth
elated
with
the
scene
and
all
was
brightness
and
splendour
miserable
man
said
the
king
of
the
goblins
in
a
more
contemptuous
tone
than
before
and
again
the
king
of
the
goblins
gave
his
leg
a
flourish
again
it
descended
on
the
shoulders
of
the
sexton
and
again
the
attendant
goblins
imitated
the
example
of
their
chief
many
a
time
the
cloud
went
and
came
and
many
a
lesson
it
taught
to
gabriel
grub
who
although
his
shoulders
smarted
with
pain
from
the
frequent
applications
of
the
goblins
feet
thereunto
looked
on
with
an
interest
that
nothing
could
diminish
he
saw
that
men
who
worked
hard
and
earned
their
scanty
bread
with
lives
of
labour
were
cheerful
and
happy
and
that
to
the
most
ignorant
the
sweet
face
of
nature
was
a
source
of
cheerfulness
and
joy
he
saw
those
who
had
been
delicately
nurtured
and
tenderly
brought
up
cheerful
under
privations
and
superior
to
suffering
that
would
have
crushed
many
of
a
rougher
grain
because
they
bore
within
their
own
bosoms
the
materials
of
happiness
contentment
and
peace
he
saw
that
women
the
tenderest
and
most
fragile
of
all
god
s
creatures
were
the
oftenest
superior
to
sorrow
adversity
and
distress
and
he
saw
that
it
was
because
they
bore
in
their
own
hearts
an
inexhaustible
of
affection
and
devotion
above
all
he
saw
that
men
like
himself
who
snarled
at
the
mirth
and
cheerfulness
of
others
were
the
foulest
weeds
on
the
fair
surface
of
the
earth
and
setting
all
the
good
of
the
world
against
the
evil
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
a
very
decent
and
respectable
sort
of
world
after
all
no
sooner
had
he
formed
it
than
the
cloud
which
had
closed
over
the
last
picture
seemed
to
settle
on
his
senses
and
lull
him
to
repose
one
by
one
the
goblins
faded
from
his
sight
and
as
the
last
one
disappeared
he
sank
to
sleep
the
day
had
broken
when
gabriel
grub
awoke
and
found
himself
lying
at
full
length
on
the
flat
gravestone
in
the
churchyard
with
the
wicker
bottle
lying
empty
by
his
side
and
his
coat
spade
and
lantern
all
well
whitened
by
the
last
night
s
frost
scattered
on
the
ground
the
stone
on
which
he
had
first
seen
the
goblin
seated
stood
bolt
upright
before
him
and
the
grave
at
which
he
had
worked
the
night
before
was
not
far
off
at
first
he
began
to
doubt
the
reality
of
his
adventures
but
the
acute
pain
in
his
shoulders
when
he
attempted
to
rise
assured
him
that
the
kicking
of
the
goblins
was
certainly
not
ideal
he
was
staggered
again
by
observing
no
traces
of
footsteps
in
the
snow
on
which
the
goblins
had
played
at
with
the
gravestones
but
he
speedily
accounted
for
this
circumstance
when
he
remembered
that
being
spirits
they
would
leave
no
visible
impression
behind
them
so
gabriel
grub
got
on
his
feet
as
well
as
he
could
for
the
pain
in
his
back
and
brushing
the
frost
off
his
coat
put
it
on
and
turned
his
face
towards
the
town
but
he
was
an
altered
man
and
he
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
returning
to
a
place
where
his
repentance
would
be
scoffed
at
and
his
reformation
disbelieved
he
hesitated
for
a
few
moments
and
then
turned
away
to
wander
where
he
might
and
seek
his
bread
elsewhere
the
lantern
the
spade
and
the
wicker
bottle
were
found
that
day
in
the
churchyard
there
were
a
great
many
speculations
about
the
sexton
s
fate
at
first
but
it
was
speedily
determined
that
he
had
been
carried
away
by
the
goblins
and
there
were
not
wanting
some
very
credible
witnesses
who
had
distinctly
seen
him
whisked
through
the
air
on
the
back
of
a
chestnut
horse
blind
of
one
eye
with
the
of
a
lion
and
the
tail
of
a
bear
at
length
all
this
was
devoutly
believed
and
the
new
sexton
used
to
exhibit
to
the
curious
for
a
trifling
emolument
a
piece
of
the
church
weathercock
which
had
been
accidentally
kicked
off
by
the
aforesaid
horse
in
his
aerial
flight
and
picked
up
by
himself
in
the
churchyard
a
year
or
two
afterwards
unfortunately
these
stories
were
somewhat
disturbed
by
the
for
reappearance
of
gabriel
grub
himself
some
ten
years
afterwards
a
ragged
contented
rheumatic
old
man
he
told
his
story
to
the
clergyman
and
also
to
the
mayor
and
in
course
of
time
it
began
to
be
received
as
a
matter
of
history
in
which
form
it
has
continued
down
to
this
very
day
the
believers
in
the
weathercock
tale
having
misplaced
their
confidence
once
were
not
easily
prevailed
upon
to
part
with
it
again
so
they
looked
as
wise
as
they
could
shrugged
their
shoulders
touched
their
foreheads
and
murmured
something
about
gabriel
grub
having
drunk
all
the
hollands
and
then
fallen
asleep
on
the
flat
tombstone
and
they
affected
to
explain
what
he
supposed
he
had
witnessed
in
the
goblin
s
cavern
by
saying
that
he
had
seen
the
world
and
grown
wiser
but
this
opinion
which
was
by
no
means
a
popular
one
at
any
time
gradually
died
off
and
be
the
matter
how
it
may
as
gabriel
grub
was
afflicted
with
rheumatism
to
the
end
of
his
days
this
story
has
at
least
one
moral
if
it
teach
no
better
one
and
that
is
that
if
a
man
turn
sulky
and
drink
by
himself
at
christmas
time
he
may
make
up
his
mind
to
be
not
a
bit
the
better
for
it
let
the
spirits
be
never
so
good
or
let
them
be
even
as
many
degrees
beyond
proof
as
those
which
gabriel
grub
saw
in
the
goblin
s
chapter
xxx
how
the
pickwickians
made
and
cultivated
the
acquaintance
of
a
couple
of
nice
young
men
belonging
to
one
of
the
liberal
professions
how
they
disported
themselves
on
the
ice
and
how
their
visit
came
to
a
conclusion

pickwick
casting

energetically
on

counterpane

sam
said
pickwick
you
may
sam
did
retire
accordingly
pickwick
at
the
expiration
of
the
quarter
of
an
hour
went
down
to
breakfast
here
he
is
at
last
said
old
wardle
pickwick
this
is
miss
allen
s
brother
benjamin
allen
ben
we
call
him
and
so
may
you
if
you
like
this
gentleman
is
his
very
particular
friend
mr
bob
sawyer
interposed
benjamin
allen
whereupon
bob
sawyer
and
benjamin
allen
laughed
in
concert
pickwick
bowed
to
bob
sawyer
and
bob
sawyer
bowed
to
pickwick
bob
and
his
very
particular
friend
then
applied
themselves
most
assiduously
to
the
eatables
before
them
and
pickwick
had
an
opportunity
of
glancing
at
them
both
benjamin
allen
was
a
coarse
stout
young
man
with
black
hair
cut
rather
short
and
a
white
face
cut
rather
long
he
was
embellished
with
spectacles
and
wore
a
white
neckerchief
below
his
black
surtout
which
was
buttoned
up
to
his
chin
appeared
the
usual
number
of
coloured
legs
terminating
in
a
pair
of
imperfectly
polished
boots
although
his
coat
was
short
in
the
sleeves
it
disclosed
no
vestige
of
a
linen
wristband
and
although
there
was
quite
enough
of
his
face
to
admit
of
the
encroachment
of
a
shirt
collar
it
was
not
graced
by
the
smallest
approach
to
that
appendage
he
presented
altogether
rather
a
mildewy
appearance
and
emitted
a
fragrant
odour
of
cubas
bob
sawyer
who
was
habited
in
a
coarse
blue
coat
which
without
being
either
a
greatcoat
or
a
surtout
partook
of
the
nature
and
qualities
of
both
had
about
him
that
sort
of
slovenly
smartness
and
swaggering
gait
which
is
peculiar
to
young
gentlemen
who
smoke
in
the
streets
by
day
shout
and
scream
in
the
same
by
night
call
waiters
by
their
christian
names
and
do
various
other
acts
and
deeds
of
an
equally
facetious
description
he
wore
a
pair
of
plaid
trousers
and
a
large
rough
waistcoat
out
of
doors
he
carried
a
thick
stick
with
a
big
top
he
eschewed
gloves
and
looked
upon
the
whole
something
like
a
dissipated
robinson
crusoe
such
were
the
two
worthies
to
whom
pickwick
was
introduced
as
he
took
his
seat
at
the
on
christmas
morning
splendid
morning
gentlemen
said
pickwick
bob
sawyer
slightly
nodded
his
assent
to
the
proposition
and
asked
benjamin
allen
for
the
mustard
have
you
come
far
this
morning
gentlemen
inquired
pickwick
blue
lion
at
muggleton
briefly
responded
allen
you
should
have
joined
us
last
night
said
pickwick
so
we
should
replied
bob
sawyer
but
the
brandy
was
too
good
to
leave
in
a
hurry
wasn
t
it
ben
certainly
said
benjamin
allen
and
the
cigars
were
not
bad
or
the
either
were
they
bob
decidedly
not
said
bob
the
particular
friends
resumed
their
attack
upon
the
breakfast
more
freely
than
before
as
if
the
recollection
of
last
night
s
supper
had
imparted
a
new
relish
to
the
meal
peg
away
bob
said
allen
to
his
companion
encouragingly
so
i
do
replied
bob
sawyer
and
so
to
do
him
justice
he
did
nothing
like
dissecting
to
give
one
an
appetite
said
bob
sawyer
looking
round
the
table
pickwick
slightly
shuddered
by
the
bye
bob
said
allen
have
you
finished
that
leg
yet
nearly
replied
sawyer
helping
himself
to
half
a
fowl
as
he
spoke
it
s
a
very
muscular
one
for
a
child
is
it
inquired
allen
carelessly
very
said
bob
sawyer
with
his
mouth
full
i
ve
put
my
name
down
for
an
arm
at
our
place
said
allen
we
re
clubbing
for
a
subject
and
the
list
is
nearly
full
only
we
can
t
get
hold
of
any
fellow
that
wants
a
head
i
wish
you
d
take
no
replied
bob
sawyer
can
t
afford
expensive
nonsense
said
allen
can
t
indeed
rejoined
bob
sawyer
i
wouldn
t
mind
a
brain
but
i
couldn
t
stand
a
whole
hush
hush
gentlemen
pray
said
pickwick
i
hear
the
as
pickwick
spoke
the
ladies
gallantly
escorted
by
snodgrass
winkle
and
tupman
returned
from
an
early
walk
why
ben
said
arabella
in
a
tone
which
expressed
more
surprise
than
pleasure
at
the
sight
of
her
brother
come
to
take
you
home
replied
benjamin
winkle
turned
pale
don
t
you
see
bob
sawyer
arabella
inquired
benjamin
allen
somewhat
reproachfully
arabella
gracefully
held
out
her
hand
in
acknowledgment
of
bob
sawyer
s
presence
a
thrill
of
hatred
struck
to
winkle
s
heart
as
bob
sawyer
inflicted
on
the
proffered
hand
a
perceptible
squeeze
ben
dear
said
arabella
blushing
have
have
you
been
introduced
to
winkle
i
have
not
been
but
i
shall
be
very
happy
to
be
arabella
replied
her
brother
gravely
here
allen
bowed
grimly
to
winkle
while
winkle
and
bob
sawyer
glanced
mutual
distrust
out
of
the
corners
of
their
eyes
the
arrival
of
the
two
new
visitors
and
the
consequent
check
upon
winkle
and
the
young
lady
with
the
fur
round
her
boots
would
in
all
probability
have
proved
a
very
unpleasant
interruption
to
the
hilarity
of
the
party
had
not
the
cheerfulness
of
pickwick
and
the
good
humour
of
the
host
been
exerted
to
the
very
utmost
for
the
common
weal
winkle
gradually
insinuated
himself
into
the
good
graces
of
benjamin
allen
and
even
joined
in
a
friendly
conversation
with
bob
sawyer
who
enlivened
with
the
brandy
and
the
breakfast
and
the
talking
gradually
ripened
into
a
state
of
extreme
facetiousness
and
related
with
much
glee
an
agreeable
anecdote
about
the
removal
of
a
tumour
on
some
gentleman
s
head
which
he
illustrated
by
means
of
an
and
a
loaf
to
the
great
edification
of
the
assembled
company
then
the
whole
train
went
to
church
where
benjamin
allen
fell
fast
asleep
while
bob
sawyer
abstracted
his
thoughts
from
worldly
matters
by
the
ingenious
process
of
carving
his
name
on
the
seat
of
the
pew
in
corpulent
letters
of
four
inches
long
now
said
wardle
after
a
substantial
lunch
with
the
agreeable
items
of
strong
beer
and
had
been
done
ample
justice
to
what
say
you
to
an
hour
on
the
ice
we
shall
have
plenty
of
capital
said
benjamin
allen
prime
ejaculated
bob
sawyer

course

said
wardle
oh

replied
winkle
i
i
am
of
oh

winkle
said
arabella
i
like
to
see
it
so
oh
it
is
graceful
said
another
young
lady
a
third
young
lady
said
it
was
elegant
and
a
fourth
expressed
her
opinion
that
it
was
i
should
be
very
happy
i
m
sure
said
winkle
reddening
but
i
have
no
this
objection
was
at
once
overruled
trundle
had
a
couple
of
pair
and
the
fat
boy
announced
that
there
were
half
a
dozen
more
downstairs
whereat
winkle
expressed
exquisite
delight
and
looked
exquisitely
uncomfortable
old
wardle
led
the
way
to
a
pretty
large
sheet
of
ice
and
the
fat
boy
and
weller
having
shovelled
and
swept
away
the
snow
which
had
fallen
on
it
during
the
night
bob
sawyer
adjusted
his
skates
with
a
dexterity
which
to
winkle
was
perfectly
marvellous
and
described
circles
with
his
left
leg
and
cut
figures
of
eight
and
inscribed
upon
the
ice
without
once
stopping
for
breath
a
great
many
other
pleasant
and
astonishing
devices
to
the
excessive
satisfaction
of
pickwick
tupman
and
the
ladies
which
reached
a
pitch
of
positive
enthusiasm
when
old
wardle
and
benjamin
allen
assisted
by
the
aforesaid
bob
sawyer
performed
some
mystic
evolutions
which
they
called
a
reel
all
this
time
winkle
with
his
face
and
hands
blue
with
the
cold
had
been
forcing
a
gimlet
into
the
sole
of
his
feet
and
putting
his
skates
on
with
the
points
behind
and
getting
the
straps
into
a
very
complicated
and
entangled
state
with
the
assistance
of
snodgrass
who
knew
rather
less
about
skates
than
a
hindoo
at
length
however
with
the
assistance
of
weller
the
unfortunate
skates
were
firmly
screwed
and
buckled
on
and
winkle
was
raised
to
his
feet
now
then
sir
said
sam
in
an
encouraging
tone
off
vith
you

show

how
to
do

sam

said
winkle
trembling
violently
and
clutching
hold
of
sam
s
arms
with
the
grasp
of
a
drowning
man
how
slippery
it
is
sam
not
an
uncommon
thing
upon
ice
sir
replied
weller
hold
up
sir
this
last
observation
of
weller
s
bore
reference
to
a
demonstration
winkle
made
at
the
instant
of
a
frantic
desire
to
throw
his
feet
in
the
air
and
dash
the
back
of
his
head
on
the
ice
these
these
are
very
awkward
skates

cried
pickwick
quite
unconscious
that
there
was
anything
the
matter

ladies

replied
winkle
with
a
ghastly
smile
i
m
just
to
begin
said
sam
endeavouring
to
disengage
himself
now
sir
start
off
stop
an
instant
sam
gasped
winkle
clinging
most
affectionately
to

replied
weller

winkle
hastily

the
way

sam
not
too
fast
sam
not
too
winkle
stooping
forward
with
his
body
half
doubled
up
was
being
assisted
over
the
ice
by
weller
in
a
very
singular
and
manner
when
pickwick
most
innocently
shouted
from
the
opposite
bank
sam
sir
here
i
want
let
go
sir
said
sam
don
t
you
hear
the
governor
let
go
with
a
violent
effort
weller
disengaged
himself
from
the
grasp
of
the
agonised
pickwickian
and
in
so
doing
administered
a
considerable
impetus
to
the
unhappy
winkle
with
an
accuracy
which
no
degree
of
dexterity
or
practice
could
have
insured
that
unfortunate
gentleman
bore
swiftly
down
into
the
centre
of
the
reel
at
the
very
moment
when
bob
sawyer
was
performing
a
flourish
of
unparalleled
beauty
winkle
struck
wildly
against
him
and
with
a
loud
crash
they
both
fell
heavily
down
pickwick
ran
to
the
spot
bob
sawyer
had
risen
to
his
feet
but
winkle
was
far
too
wise
to
do
anything
of
the
kind
in
skates
he
was
seated
on
the
ice
making
spasmodic
efforts
to
smile
but
anguish
was
depicted
on
every
lineament
of
his
countenance
are
you
hurt
inquired
benjamin
allen
with
great
anxiety
not
much
said
winkle
rubbing
his
back
very
hard
i
wish
you
d
let
me
bleed
you
said
benjamin
with
great
eagerness
no
thank
you
replied
winkle
hurriedly
i
really
think
you
had
better
said
allen
thank
you
replied
winkle
i
d
rather
what
do
pickwick
inquired
bob
sawyer
pickwick
was
excited
and
indignant
he
beckoned
to
weller
and
said
in
a
stern
voice
take
his
skates
no
but
really
i
had
scarcely
begun
remonstrated
winkle
take
his
skates
off
repeated
pickwick
firmly
the
command
was
not
to
be
resisted
winkle
allowed
sam
to
obey
it
in
silence
lift
him
up
said
pickwick
sam
assisted
him
to
rise
pickwick
retired
a
few
paces
apart
from
the
bystanders
and
beckoning
his
friend
to
approach
fixed
a
searching
look
upon
him
and
uttered
in
a
low
but
distinct
and
emphatic
tone
these
remarkable
words
you
re
a
humbug
a
what
said
winkle
starting
a
humbug
sir
i
will
speak
plainer
if
you
wish
it
an
impostor
with
those
words
pickwick
turned
slowly
on
his
heel
and
rejoined
his
friends
while
pickwick
was
delivering
himself
of
the
sentiment
just
recorded
weller
and
the
fat
boy
having
by
their
joint
endeavours
cut
out
a
slide
were
exercising
themselves
thereupon
in
a
very
masterly
and
brilliant
manner
sam
weller
in
particular
was
displaying
that
beautiful
feat
of
which
is
currently
denominated
knocking
at
the
cobbler
s
door
and
which
is
achieved
by
skimming
over
the
ice
on
one
foot
and
occasionally
giving
a
postman
s
knock
upon
it
with
the
other
it
was
a
good
long
slide
and
there
was
something
in
the
motion
which
pickwick
who
was
very
cold
with
standing
still
could
not
help
envying
it
looks
a
nice
warm
exercise
that
doesn
t
it
he
inquired
of
wardle
when
that
gentleman
was
thoroughly
out
of
breath
by
reason
of
the
indefatigable
manner
in
which
he
had
converted
his
legs
into
a
pair
of
compasses
and
drawn
complicated
problems
on
the
ice
ah
it
does
indeed
replied
wardle
do
you
slide
i
used
to
do
so
on
the
gutters
when
i
was
a
boy
replied
pickwick
try
it
now
said
wardle
oh
do
please
pickwick
cried
all
the
ladies
i
should
be
very
happy
to
afford
you
any
amusement
replied
pickwick
but
i
haven
t
done
such
a
thing
these
thirty
pooh
pooh
nonsense
said
wardle
dragging
off
his
skates
with
the
impetuosity
which
characterised
all
his
proceedings
here
i
ll
keep
you
company
come
along
and
away
went
the
old
fellow
down
the
slide
with
a
rapidity
which
came
very
close
upon
weller
and
beat
the
fat
boy
all
to
nothing
pickwick
paused
considered
pulled
off
his
gloves
and
put
them
in
his
hat
took
two
or
three
short
runs
baulked
himself
as
often
and
at
last
took
another
run
and
went
slowly
and
gravely
down
the
slide
with
his
feet
about
a
yard
and
a
quarter
apart
amidst
the
gratified
shouts
of
all
the
spectators
keep
the
pot
sir
said
sam
and
down
went
wardle
again
and
then
pickwick
and
then
sam
and
then
winkle
and
then
bob
sawyer
and
then
the
fat
boy
and
then
snodgrass
following
closely
upon
each
other
s
heels
and
running
after
each
other
with
as
much
eagerness
as
if
their
future
prospects
in
life
depended
on
their
expedition
it
was
the
most
intensely
interesting
thing
to
observe
the
manner
in
which
pickwick
performed
his
share
in
the
ceremony
to
watch
the
torture
of
anxiety
with
which
he
viewed
the
person
behind
gaining
upon
him
at
the
imminent
hazard
of
tripping
him
up
to
see
him
gradually
expend
the
painful
force
he
had
put
on
at
first
and
turn
slowly
round
on
the
slide
with
his
face
towards
the
point
from
which
he
had
started
to
contemplate
the
playful
smile
which
mantled
on
his
face
when
he
had
accomplished
the
distance
and
the
eagerness
with
which
he
turned
round
when
he
had
done
so
and
ran
after
his
predecessor
his
black
gaiters
tripping
pleasantly
through
the
snow
and
his
eyes
beaming
cheerfulness
and
gladness
through
his
spectacles
and
when
he
was
knocked
down
which
happened
upon
the
average
every
third
round
it
was
the
most
invigorating
sight
that
can
possibly
be
imagined
to
behold
him
gather
up
his
hat
gloves
and
handkerchief
with
a
glowing
countenance
and
resume
his
station
in
the
rank
with
an
ardour
and
enthusiasm
that
nothing
could
abate
the
sport
was
at
its
height
the
sliding
was
at
the
quickest
the
laughter
was
at
the
loudest
when
a
sharp
smart
crack
was
heard
there
was
a
quick
rush
towards
the
bank
a
wild
scream
from
the
ladies
and
a
shout
from
tupman
a
large
mass
of
ice
disappeared
the
water
bubbled
up
over
it
pickwick
s
hat
gloves
and
handkerchief
were
floating
on
the
surface
and
this
was
all
of
pickwick
that
anybody
could
see
dismay
and
anguish
were
depicted
on
every
countenance
the
males
turned
pale
and
the
females
fainted
snodgrass
and
winkle
grasped
each
other
by
the
hand
and
gazed
at
the
spot
where
their
leader
had
gone
down
with
frenzied
eagerness
while
tupman
by
way
of
rendering
the
promptest
assistance
and
at
the
same
time
conveying
to
any
persons
who
might
be
within
hearing
the
clearest
possible
notion
of
the
catastrophe
ran
off
across
the
country
at
his
utmost
speed
screaming
fire
with
all
his
might
it
was
at
this
moment
when
old
wardle
and
sam
weller
were
approaching
the
hole
with
cautious
steps
and
benjamin
allen
was
holding
a
hurried
consultation
with
bob
sawyer
on
the
advisability
of
bleeding
the
company
generally
as
an
improving
little
bit
of
professional
practice
it
was
at
this
very
moment
that
a
face
head
and
shoulders
emerged
from
beneath
the
water
and
disclosed
the
features
and
spectacles
of
pickwick
keep
yourself
up
for
an
instant
for
only
one
instant
bawled
snodgrass
yes
do
let
me
implore
you
for
my
sake
roared
winkle
deeply
affected
the
adjuration
was
rather
unnecessary
the
probability
being
that
if
pickwick
had
declined
to
keep
himself
up
for
anybody
else
s
sake
it
would
have
occurred
to
him
that
he
might
as
well
do
so
for
his
own
do
you
feel
the
bottom
there
old
fellow
said
wardle
yes
certainly
replied
pickwick
wringing
the
water
from
his
head
and
face
and
gasping
for
breath
i
fell
upon
my
back
i
couldn
t
get
on
my
feet
at
the
clay
upon
so
much
of
pickwick
s
coat
as
was
yet
visible
bore
testimony
to
the
accuracy
of
this
statement
and
as
the
fears
of
the
spectators
were
still
further
relieved
by
the
fat
boy
s
suddenly
recollecting
that
the
water
was
nowhere
more
than
five
feet
deep
prodigies
of
valour
were
performed
to
get
him
out
after
a
vast
quantity
of
splashing
and
cracking
and
struggling
pickwick
was
at
length
fairly
extricated
from
his
unpleasant
position
and
once
more
stood
on
dry
land
oh
he
ll
catch
his
death
of
cold
said
emily
dear
old
thing
said
arabella
let
me
wrap
this
shawl
round
you
ah
that
s
the
best
thing
you
can
do
said
wardle
and
when
you
ve
got
it
on
run
home
as
fast
as
your
legs
can
carry
you
and
jump
into
bed
a
dozen
shawls
were
offered
on
the
instant
three
or
four
of
the
thickest
having
been
selected
pickwick
was
wrapped
up
and
started
off
under
the
guidance
of
weller
presenting
the
singular
phenomenon
of
an
elderly
gentleman
dripping
wet
and
without
a
hat
with
his
arms
bound
down
to
his
sides
skimming
over
the
ground
without
any
purpose
at
the
rate
of
six
good
english
miles
an
hour
but
pickwick
cared
not
for
appearances
in
such
an
extreme
case
and
urged
on
by
sam
weller
he
kept
at
the
very
top
of
his
speed
until
he
reached
the
door
of
manor
farm
where
tupman
had
arrived
some
five
minutes
before
and
had
frightened
the
old
lady
into
palpitations
of
the
heart
by
impressing
her
with
the
unalterable
conviction
that
the
kitchen
chimney
was
on
fire
a
calamity
which
always
presented
itself
in
glowing
colours
to
the
old
lady
s
mind
when
anybody
about
her
evinced
the
smallest
agitation
pickwick
paused
not
an
instant
until
he
was
snug
in
bed
sam
weller
lighted
a
blazing
fire
in
the
room
and
took
up
his
dinner
a
bowl
of
punch
was
carried
up
afterwards
and
a
grand
carouse
held
in
honour
of
his
safety
old
wardle
would
not
hear
of
his
rising
so
they
made
the
bed
the
chair
and
pickwick
presided
a
second
and
a
third
bowl
were
ordered
in
and
when
pickwick
awoke
next
morning
there
was
not
a
symptom
of
rheumatism
about
him
which
proves
as
bob
sawyer
very
justly
observed
that
there
is
nothing
like
hot
punch
in
such
cases
and
that
if
ever
hot
punch
did
fail
to
act
as
a
preventive
it
was
merely
because
the
patient
fell
into
the
vulgar
error
of
not
taking
enough
of
it
the
jovial
party
broke
up
next
morning
are
capital
things
in
our
but
in
after
life
they
are
painful
enough
death
and
fortune
s
changes
are
every
day
breaking
up
many
a
happy
group
and
scattering
them
far
and
wide
and
the
boys
and
girls
never
come
back
again
we
do
not
mean
to
say
that
it
was
exactly
the
case
in
this
particular
instance
all
we
wish
to
inform
the
reader
is
that
the
different
members
of
the
party
dispersed
to
their
several
homes
that
pickwick
and
his
friends
once
more
took
their
seats
on
the
top
of
the
muggleton
coach
and
that
arabella
allen
repaired
to
her
place
of
destination
wherever
it
might
have
been
we
dare
say
winkle
knew
but
we
confess
we
don
t
under
the
care
and
guardianship
of
her
brother
benjamin
and
his
most
intimate
and
particular
friend
bob
sawyer
before
they
separated
however
that
gentleman
and
benjamin
allen
drew
pickwick
aside
with
an
air
of
some
mystery
and
bob
sawyer
thrusting
his
forefinger
between
two
of
pickwick
s
ribs
and
thereby
displaying
his
native
drollery
and
his
knowledge
of
the
anatomy
of
the
human
frame
at
one
and
the
same
time
inquired
i
say
old
boy
where
do
you
hang
out
pickwick
replied
that
he
was
at
present
suspended
at
the
george
and
vulture
i
wish
you
d
come
and
see
me
said
bob
sawyer
nothing
would
give
me
greater
pleasure
replied
pickwick
there
s
my
lodgings
said
bob
sawyer
producing
a
card
lant
street
borough
it
s
near
guy
s
and
handy
for
me
you
know
little
distance
after
you
ve
passed
george
s
church
turns
out
of
the
high
street
on
the
right
hand
side
the
i
shall
find
it
said
pickwick
come
on
thursday
fortnight
and
bring
the
other
chaps
with
you
said
bob
sawyer
i
m
going
to
have
a
few
medical
fellows
that
pickwick
expressed
the
pleasure
it
would
afford
him
to
meet
the
medical
fellows
and
after
bob
sawyer
had
informed
him
that
he
meant
to
be
very
cosy
and
that
his
friend
ben
was
to
be
one
of
the
party
they
shook
hands
and
separated
we
feel
that
in
this
place
we
lay
ourself
open
to
the
inquiry
whether
winkle
was
whispering
during
this
brief
conversation
to
arabella
allen
and
if
so
what
he
said
and
furthermore
whether
snodgrass
was
conversing
apart
with
emily
wardle
and
if
so
what
said
to
this
we
reply
that
whatever
they
might
have
said
to
the
ladies
they
said
nothing
at
all
to
pickwick
or
tupman
for
miles
and
that
they
sighed
very
often
refused
ale
and
brandy
and
looked
gloomy
if
our
observant
lady
readers
can
deduce
any
satisfactory
inferences
from
these
facts
we
beg
them
by
all
means
to
do
so

all

there
may

constantly

with

of

for

think
there

nothing

varieties
of

too
numerous
to
recapitulate
but
however
numerous
they
may
be
they
are
all
to
be

at

regulated
business
hours
hurrying
to
and
from
the
places
we
have
just
mentioned
these
sequestered

are
the
public

legal
profession
where

are
issued
judgments
signed

filed

put
in

for

torment
of

and
the
comfort
and
emolument
of
the
practitioners
of
the
law
they
are
for
the
most
part
roofed
mouldy
rooms
where
innumerable
rolls
of
parchment
which
have
been
perspiring
in
secret
for
the
last
century
send
forth
an
agreeable
odour
which
is
mingled
by
day
with
the
scent
of
the
and
by
night
with
the
various
exhalations
which
arise
from
damp
cloaks
festering
umbrellas
and
the
coarsest
tallow
candles
about
seven
o
clock
in
the
evening
some
ten
days
or
a
fortnight
after
pickwick
and
his
friends
returned
to
london
there
hurried
into
one
of
these
offices
an
individual
in
a
brown
coat
and
brass
buttons
whose
long
hair
was
scrupulously
twisted
round
the
rim
of
his
napless
hat
and
whose
soiled
drab
trousers
were
so
tightly
strapped
over
his
blucher
boots
that
his
knees
threatened
every
moment
to
start
from
their
concealment
he
produced
from
his
coat
pockets
a
long
and
narrow
strip
of
parchment
on
which
the
presiding
functionary
impressed
an
illegible
black
stamp
he
then
drew
forth
four
scraps
of
paper
of
similar
dimensions
each
containing
a
printed
copy
of
the
strip
of
parchment
with
blanks
for
a
name
and
having
filled
up
the
blanks
put
all
the
five
documents
in
his
pocket
and
hurried
away
the
man
in
the
brown
coat
with
the
cabalistic
documents
in
his
pocket
was
no
other
than
our
old
acquaintance
jackson
of
the
house
of
dodson
fogg
freeman
s
court
cornhill
instead
of
returning
to
the
office
whence
he
came
however
he
bent
his
steps
direct
to
sun
court
and
walking
straight
into
the
george
and
vulture
demanded
to
know
whether
one
pickwick
was
within
call
pickwick
s
servant
tom
said
the
barmaid
of
the
george
and
vulture
don
t
trouble
yourself
said
jackson
i
ve
come
on
business
if
you
ll
show
me
pickwick
s
room
i
ll
step
up
what
name
sir
said
the
waiter
jackson
replied
the
clerk
the
waiter
stepped
upstairs
to
announce
jackson
but
jackson
saved
him
the
trouble
by
following
close
at
his
heels
and
walking
into
the
apartment
before
he
could
articulate
a
syllable
pickwick
had
that
day
invited
his
three
friends
to
dinner
they
were
all
seated
round
the
fire
drinking
their
wine
when
jackson
presented
himself
as
above
described
how
de
do
sir
said
jackson
nodding
to
pickwick
that
gentleman
bowed
and
looked
somewhat
surprised
for
the
physiognomy
of
jackson
dwelt
not
in
his
recollection
i
have
called
from
dodson
and
fogg
s
said
jackson
in
an
explanatory
tone
pickwick
roused
at
the
name
i
refer
you
to
my
attorney
sir
perker
of
gray
s
inn
said
he
waiter
show
this
gentleman
beg
your
pardon
pickwick
said
jackson
deliberately
depositing
his
hat
on
the
floor
and
drawing
from
his
pocket
the
strip
of
parchment
but
personal
service
by
clerk
or
agent
in
these
cases
you
know
pickwick
nothing
like
caution
sir
in
all
legal
forms
eh
here
jackson
cast
his
eye
on
the
parchment
and
resting
his
hands
on
the
table
and
looking
round
with
a
winning
and
persuasive
smile
said
now
come
don
t
let
s
have
no
words
about
such
a
little
matter
as
this
which
of
you
gentlemen
s
name
s
snodgrass
at
this
inquiry
snodgrass
gave
such
a
very
undisguised
and
palpable
start
that
no
further
reply
was
needed
ah
i
thought
so
said
jackson
more
affably
than
before
i
ve
a
little
something
to
trouble
you
with
me
exclaimed
snodgrass
it
s
only
a
subpoena
in
bardell
and
pickwick
on
behalf
of
the
plaintiff
replied
jackson
singling
out
one
of
the
slips
of
paper
and
producing
a
shilling
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
it
ll
come
on
in
the
settens
after
term
fourteenth
of
febooary
we
expect
we
ve
marked
it
a
special
jury
cause
and
it
s
only
ten
down
the
paper
that
s
yours
as
jackson
said
this
he
presented
the
parchment
before
the
eyes
of
snodgrass
and
slipped
the
paper
and
the
shilling
into
his
hand
tupman
had
witnessed
this
process
in
silent
astonishment
when
jackson
turning
sharply
upon
him
said
i
think
i
ain
t
mistaken
when
i
say
your
name
s
tupman
am
i
tupman
looked
at
pickwick
but
perceiving
no
encouragement
in
that
gentleman
s
eyes
to
deny
his
name
said
yes
my
name
is
tupman
and
that
other
gentleman
s
winkle
i
think
said
jackson
winkle
faltered
out
a
reply
in
the
affirmative
and
both
gentlemen
were
forthwith
invested
with
a
slip
of
paper
and
a
shilling
each
by
the
dexterous
jackson
now
said
jackson
i
m
afraid
you
ll
think
me
rather
troublesome
but
i
want
somebody
else
if
it
ain
t
inconvenient
i
have
samuel
weller
s
name
here
send
my
servant
here
waiter
said
pickwick
the
waiter
retired
considerably
astonished
and
pickwick
motioned
jackson
to
a
seat
there
was
a
painful
pause
which
was
at
length
broken
by
the
innocent
defendant
i
suppose
sir
said
pickwick
his
indignation
rising
while
he
spoke
i
suppose
sir
that
it
is
the
intention
of
your
employers
to
seek
to
criminate
me
upon
the
testimony
of
my
own
friends
jackson
struck
his
forefinger
several
times
against
the
left
side
of
his
nose
to
intimate
that
he
was
not
there
to
disclose
the
secrets
of
the
prison
house
and
playfully
rejoined
not
knowin
can
t
for
what
other
reason
sir
pursued
pickwick
are
these
subpoenas
served
upon
them
if
not
for
this
very
good
plant
pickwick
replied
jackson
slowly
shaking
his
head
but
it
won
t
do
no
harm
in
trying
but
there
s
little
to
be
got
out
of
here
jackson
smiled
once
more
upon
the
company
and
applying
his
left
thumb
to
the
tip
of
his
nose
worked
a
visionary
with
his
right
hand
thereby
performing
a
very
graceful
piece
of
pantomime
then
much
in
vogue
but
now
unhappily
almost
obsolete
which
was
familiarly
denominated
taking
a
no
no
pickwick
said
jackson
in
conclusion
perker
s
people
must
guess
what
we
ve
served
these
subpoenas
for
if
they
can
t
they
must
wait
till
the
action
comes
on
and
then
they
ll
find
pickwick
bestowed
a
look
of
excessive
disgust
on
his
unwelcome
visitor
and
would
probably
have
hurled
some
tremendous
anathema
at
the
heads
of
dodson
fogg
had
not
sam
s
entrance
at
the
instant
interrupted
him
samuel
weller
said
jackson
inquiringly
vun
o
the
truest
things
as
you
ve
said
for
many
a
long
year
replied
sam
in
a
most
composed
manner
here
s
a
subpoena
for
you
weller
said
jackson
what
s
that
in
english
inquired
sam
here
s
the
original
said
jackson
declining
the
required
explanation
which
said
sam
this
replied
jackson
shaking
the
parchment
oh
that
s
the
rig
nal
is
it
said
sam
well
i
m
wery
glad
i
ve
seen
the
rig
nal
cos
it
s
a
gratifyin
sort
o
thing
and
eases
vun
s
mind
so
and
here
s
the
shilling
said
jackson
it
s
from
dodson
and
fogg
and
it
s
uncommon
handsome
o
dodson
and
fogg
as
knows
so
little
of
me
to
come
down
vith
a
present
said
sam
i
feel
it
as
a
wery
high
compliment
sir
it
s
a
wery
honorable
thing
to
them
as
they
knows
how
to
reward
merit
werever
they
meets
it
besides
which
it
s
affectin
to
one
s
feelin
as
weller
said
this
he
inflicted
a
little
friction
on
his
right
eyelid
with
the
sleeve
of
his
coat
after
the
most
approved
manner
of
actors
when
they
are
in
domestic
pathetics
jackson
seemed
rather
puzzled
by
sam
s
proceedings
but
as
he
had
served
the
subpoenas
and
had
nothing
more
to
say
he
made
a
feint
of
putting
on
the
one
glove
which
he
usually
carried
in
his
hand
for
the
sake
of
appearances
and
returned
to
the
office
to
report
progress
pickwick
slept
little
that
night
his
memory
had
received
a
very
disagreeable
refresher
on
the
subject
of
bardell
s
action
he
breakfasted
betimes
next
morning
and
desiring
sam
to
accompany
him
set
forth
towards
gray
s
inn
square
sam
said
pickwick
looking
round
when
they
got
to
the
end
of
cheapside
sir
said
sam
stepping
up
to
his
master
which
way
up
newgate
pickwick
did
not
turn
round
immediately
but
looked
vacantly
in
sam
s
face
for
a
few
seconds
and
heaved
a
deep
sigh
what
s
the
matter
sir
inquired
sam
this
action
sam
said
pickwick
is
expected
to
come
on
on
the
fourteenth
of
next
remarkable
coincidence
that
ere
sir
replied
sam
why
remarkable
sam
inquired
pickwick
walentine

day
sir
responded
sam
reg
lar
good
day
for
a
breach
o
promise
weller
s
smile
awakened
no
gleam
of
mirth
in
his
master
s
countenance
pickwick
turned
abruptly
round
and
led
the
way
in
silence
they
had
walked
some
distance
pickwick
trotting
on
before
plunged
in
profound
meditation
and
sam
following
behind
with
a
countenance
expressive
of
the
most
enviable
and
easy
defiance
of
everything
and
everybody
when
the
latter
who
was
always
especially
anxious
to
impart
to
his
master
any
exclusive
information
he
possessed
quickened
his
pace
until
he
was
close
at
pickwick
s
heels
and
pointing
up
at
a
house
they
were
passing
said
wery
nice

pickwick

reiterated
sam
with
some
indignation
i
should
rayther
think
it
was
why
sir
bless
your
innocent
eyebrows
that
s
where
the
mysterious
disappearance
of
a
spectable
tradesman
took
place
four
years
you
don
t
mean
to
say
he
was
burked
sam
said
pickwick
looking
hastily
round
no
i
don
t
indeed
sir
replied
weller
i
wish
i
did
far
worse
than
that
he
was
the
master
o
that
ere
shop
sir
and
the
inwentor
o
the
sassage
as
ud
swaller
up
a
pavin
stone
if
you

it
too
near
and

it
into
sassages
as
easy
as
if

was
a
tender
young
babby
wery
proud
o

machine
he
was
as

the

turnin
wery
pale
i
see

says
the
widder
in
a
fit
of
temporary
insanity
he
rashly
converted
hisself
into
sassages
and
so
he
had
sir
said
weller
looking
steadily
into
pickwick
s
countenance
or
else
he
d
been
draw
d
into
the
ingin
but
however
that
might
ha
been
the
little
old
gen
l
m
n
who
had
been
remarkably
partial
to
sassages
all
his
life
rushed
out
o
the
shop
in
a
wild
state
and
was
never
heerd
on
arterwards
the
relation
of
this
affecting
incident
of
private
life
brought
master
and
man
to
perker
s
chambers
lowten
holding
the
door
half
open
was
in
conversation
with
a
man
in
boots
without
toes
and
gloves
without
fingers
there
were
traces
of
privation
and
suffering
almost
of
despair
in
his
lank
and
countenance
he
felt
his
poverty
for
he
shrank
to
the
dark
side
of
the
staircase
as
pickwick
approached
it
s
very
unfortunate
said
the
stranger
with
a
sigh
very
said
lowten
scribbling
his
name
on
the
doorpost
with
his
pen
and
rubbing
it
out
again
with
the
feather
will
you
leave
a
message
for
him
when
do
you
think
he
ll
be
back
inquired
the
stranger
quite
uncertain
replied
lowten
winking
at
pickwick
as
the
stranger
cast
his
eyes
towards
the
ground
you
don
t
think
it
would
be
of
any
use
my
waiting
for
him
said
the
stranger
looking
wistfully
into
the
office
oh
no
i
m
sure
it
wouldn
t
replied
the
clerk
moving
a
little
more
into
the
centre
of
the
doorway
he
s
certain
not
to
be
back
this
week
and
it
s
a
chance
whether
he
will
be
next
for
when
perker
once
gets
out
of
town
he
s
never
in
a
hurry
to
come
back
out
of
town
said
pickwick
dear
me
how
unfortunate
don
t
go
away
pickwick
said
lowten
i
ve
got
a
letter
for
the
stranger
seeming
to
hesitate
once
more
looked
towards
the
ground
and
the
clerk
winked
slyly
at
pickwick
as
if
to
intimate
that
some
exquisite
piece
of
humour
was
going
forward
though
what
it
was
pickwick
could
not
for
the
life
of
him
divine
step
in
pickwick
said
lowten
well
will
you
leave
a
message
watty
or
will
you
call
again
ask
him
to
be
so
kind
as
to
leave
out
word
what
has
been
done
in
my
business
said
the
man
for
god
s
sake
don
t
neglect
it
no
no
i
won
t
forget
it
replied
the
clerk
walk
in
pickwick
watty
it
s
a
fine
day
for
walking
isn
t
it
seeing
that
the
stranger
still
lingered
he
beckoned
sam
weller
to
follow
his
master
in
and
shut
the
door
in
his
face
there
never
was
such
a
pestering
bankrupt
as
that
since
the
world
began
i
do
believe
said
lowten
throwing
down
his
pen
with
the
air
of
an
injured
man
his
affairs
haven
t
been
in
chancery
quite
four
years
yet
and
i
m
d
d
if
he
don
t
come
worrying
here
twice
a
week
step
this
way
pickwick
perker
in
and
he
ll
see
you
i
know
devilish
cold
he
added
pettishly
standing
at
that
door
wasting
one
s
time
with
such
seedy
vagabonds
having
very
vehemently
stirred
a
particularly
large
fire
with
a
particularly
small
poker
the
clerk
led
the
way
to
his
principal
s
private
room
and
announced
pickwick
ah
my
dear
sir
said
little
perker
bustling
up
from
his
chair
well
my
dear
sir

sleeping
i
know
that
ah
they
re
very
smart
fellows
very
smart
as
the
little
man
concluded
he
took
an
emphatic
pinch
of
snuff
as
a
tribute
to
the
smartness
of
dodson
and
fogg
they
are
great
scoundrels
said
pickwick
aye
aye
said
the
little
man
that
s
a
matter
of
opinion
you
know
and
we
won
t
dispute
about
terms
because
of
course
you
can
t
be
expected
to
view
these
subjects
with
a
professional
eye
well
we
ve
done
everything
that
s
necessary
i
have
retained
serjeant
is

inquired
pickwick

very
top

his
profession

business
of
any

in
every
case

mention
it
abroad
but
we
say
we
of
the
profession
that
serjeant
snubbin
leads
the
court
by
the
the
little
man
took
another
pinch
of
snuff
as
he
made
this
communication
and
nodded
mysteriously
to
pickwick
they
have
subpoenaed
my
three
friends
said
pickwick
ah
of
course
they
would
replied
perker
important
witnesses
saw
you
in
a
delicate
but
she
fainted
of
her
own
accord
said
pickwick
she
threw
herself
into
my

dear
sir
replied
perker
very
likely
and
very
natural
nothing
more
so
my
dear
sir
nothing
but
who
s
to
prove
it
they
have
subpoenaed
my
servant

said
pickwick
quitting
the
other
point
for
there
perker
s
question
had
somewhat
staggered
him
sam
said
perker
pickwick
replied
in
the
affirmative
of
course
my
dear
sir
of
course
i
knew
they
would

could
have
told
you
that
a
month
ago

dear
sir

management
of
your
affairs

your
own
hands
after
entrusting
them
to
your
solicitor
you
must
also
take
the
here
perker
drew
himself
up
with
conscious
dignity
and
brushed
some
stray
grains
of
snuff
from
his
shirt
frill
and
what
do
they
want
him
to
prove
asked
pickwick
after
two
or
three
minutes
silence
that
you
sent
him
up
to
the
plaintiff
s
to
make
some
offer
of
a
compromise
i
suppose
replied
perker
it
don
t
matter
much
though
i
don
t
think
many
counsel
could
get
a
great
deal
out
of
i
don
t
think
they
could
said
pickwick
smiling
despite
his
vexation
at
the
idea
of
sam
s
appearance
as
a
witness
what
course
do
we
pursue
we
have
only
one
to
adopt
my
dear
sir
replied
perker
the
witnesses
trust
to
snubbin
s
eloquence
throw
dust
in
the
eyes
of
the
judge
throw
ourselves
on
the
and
suppose
the
verdict
is
against
me
said
pickwick
perker
smiled
took
a
very
long
pinch
of
snuff
stirred
the
fire
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
remained
expressively
silent
you
mean
that
in
that
case
i
must
pay
the
damages
said
pickwick
who
had
watched
this
telegraphic
answer
with
considerable
sternness
perker
gave
the
fire
another
very
unnecessary
poke
and
said
i
am
afraid
then
i
beg
to
announce
to
you
my
unalterable
determination
to
pay
no
damages
whatever
said
pickwick
most
emphatically
none
perker
not
a
pound
not
a
penny
of
my
money
shall
find
its
way
into
the
pockets
of
dodson
and
fogg
that
is
my
deliberate
and
irrevocable
pickwick
gave
a
heavy
blow
on
the
table
before
him
in
confirmation
of
the
irrevocability
of
his
intention
very
well
my
dear
sir
very
well
said
perker
you
know
best
of
of
course
replied
pickwick
hastily
where
does
serjeant
snubbin
live
in
lincoln
s
inn
old
square
replied
perker
i
should
like
to
see
him
said
pickwick
see
serjeant
snubbin
my
dear
sir
rejoined
perker
in
utter
amazement
pooh
pooh
my
dear
sir
impossible
see
serjeant
snubbin
bless
you
my
dear
sir
such
a
thing
was
never
heard
of
without
a
consultation
fee
being
previously
paid
and
a
consultation
fixed
it
couldn
t
be
done
my
dear
sir
it
couldn
t
be
pickwick
however
had
made
up
his
mind
not
only
that
it
could
be
done
but
that
it
should
be
done
and
the
consequence
was
that
within
ten
minutes
after
he
had
received
the
assurance
that
the
thing
was
impossible
he
was
conducted
by
his
solicitor
into
the
outer
office
of
the
great
serjeant
snubbin
himself
it
was
an
uncarpeted
room
of
tolerable
dimensions
with
a
large
table
drawn
up
near
the
fire
the
baize
top
of
which
had
long
since
lost
all
claim
to
its
original
hue
of
green
and
had
gradually
grown
gray
with
dust
and
age
except
where
all
traces
of
its
natural
colour
were
obliterated
by
upon
the
table
were
numerous
little
bundles
of
papers
tied
with
red
tape
and
behind
it
sat
an
elderly
clerk
whose
sleek
appearance
and
heavy
gold
presented
imposing
indications
of
the
extensive
and
lucrative
practice
of
serjeant
snubbin
is
the
serjeant
in
his
room
mallard
inquired
perker
offering
his
box
with
all
imaginable
courtesy
yes
he
is
was
the
reply
but
he
s
very
busy
look
here
not
an
opinion
given
yet
on
any
one
of
these
cases
and
an
expedition
fee
paid
with
all
of
the
clerk
smiled
as
he
said
this
and
inhaled
the
pinch
of
snuff
with
a
zest
which
seemed
to
be
compounded
of
a
fondness
for
snuff
and
a
relish
for
fees
something
like
practice
that
said
perker
yes
said
the
barrister
s
clerk
producing
his
own
box
and
offering
it
with
the
greatest
cordiality
and
the
best
of
it
is
that
as
nobody
alive
except
myself
can
read
the
serjeant
s
writing
they
are
obliged
to
wait
for
the
opinions
when
he
has
given
them
till
i
have
copied
em
which
makes
good
for
we
know
who
besides
the
serjeant
and
draws
a
little
more
out
of
the
clients
eh
said
perker
ha
ha
ha
at
this
the
serjeant
s
clerk
laughed
again
not
a
noisy
boisterous
laugh
but
a
silent
internal
chuckle
which
pickwick
disliked
to
hear
when
a
man
bleeds
inwardly
it
is
a
dangerous
thing
for
himself
but
when
he
laughs
inwardly
it
bodes
no
good
to
other
people
you
haven
t
made
me
out
that
little
list
of
the
fees
that
i
m
in
your
debt
have
you
said
perker
no
i
have
not
replied
the
clerk
i
wish
you
would
said
perker
let
me
have
them
and
i
ll
send
you
a
cheque
but
i
suppose
you
re
too
busy
pocketing
the
ready
money
to
think
of
the
debtors
eh
ha
ha
ha
this
sally
seemed
to
tickle
the
clerk
amazingly
and
he
once
more
enjoyed
a
little
quiet
laugh
to
himself
but
mallard
my
dear
friend
said
perker
suddenly
recovering
his
gravity
and
drawing
the
great
man
s
great
man
into
a
corner
by
the
lappel
of
his
coat
you
must
persuade
the
serjeant
to
see
me
and
my
client
come
come
said
the
clerk
that
s
not
bad
either
see
the
serjeant
come
that
s
too
notwithstanding
the
absurdity
of
the
proposal
however
the
clerk
allowed
himself
to
be
gently
drawn
beyond
the
hearing
of
pickwick
and
after
a
short
conversation
conducted
in
whispers
walked
softly
down
a
little
dark
passage
and
disappeared
into
the
legal
luminary
s
sanctum
whence
he
shortly
returned
on
tiptoe
and
informed
perker
and
pickwick
that
the
serjeant
had
been
prevailed
upon
in
violation
of
all
established
rules
and
customs
to
admit
them
at
once
serjeant
snubbins
was
a
man
of
about
or
as
the
novels
say
he
might
be
fifty
he
had
that
boiled
eye
which
is
often
to
be
seen
in
the
heads
of
people
who
have
applied
themselves
during
many
years
to
a
weary
and
laborious
course
of
study
and
which
would
have
been
sufficient
without
the
additional
eyeglass
which
dangled
from
a
broad
black
riband
round
his
neck
to
warn
a
stranger
that
he
was
very
his
hair
was
thin
and
weak
which
was
partly
attributable
to
his
having
never
devoted
much
time
to
its
arrangement
and
partly
to
his
having
worn
for
years
the
forensic
wig
which
hung
on
a
block
beside
him
the
marks
of
hairpowder
on
his
and
the
and
worse
tied
white
neckerchief
round
his
throat
showed
that
he
had
not
found
leisure
since
he
left
the
court
to
make
any
alteration
in
his
dress
while
the
slovenly
style
of
the
remainder
of
his
costume
warranted
the
inference
that
his
personal
appearance
would
not
have
been
very
much
improved
if
he
had
books
of
practice
heaps
of
papers
and
opened
letters
were
scattered
over
the
table
without
any
attempt
at
order
or
arrangement
the
furniture
of
the
room
was
old
and
rickety
the
doors
of
the
were
rotting
in
their
hinges
the
dust
flew
out
from
the
carpet
in
little
clouds
at
every
step
the
blinds
were
yellow
with
age
and
dirt
the
state
of
everything
in
the
room
showed
with
a
clearness
not
to
be
mistaken
that
serjeant
snubbin
was
far
too
much
occupied
with
his
professional
pursuits
to
take
any
great
heed
or
regard
of
his
personal
comforts
the
serjeant
was
writing
when
his
clients
entered
he
bowed
abstractedly
when
pickwick
was
introduced
by
his
solicitor
and
then
motioning
them
to
a
seat
put
his
pen
carefully
in
the
inkstand
nursed
his
left
leg
and
waited
to
be
spoken
to
mr
pickwick
is
the
defendant
in
bardell
and
pickwick
serjeant
snubbin
said
perker
i
am
retained
in
that
am
i
said
the
serjeant
you
are
sir
replied
perker
the
serjeant
nodded
his
head
and
waited
for
something
else
mr
pickwick
was
anxious
to
call
upon
you
serjeant
snubbin
said
perker
to
state
to
you
before
you
entered
upon
the
case
that
he
denies
there
being
any
ground
or
pretence
whatever
for
the
action
against
him
and
that
unless
he
came
into
court
with
clean
hands
and
without
the
most
conscientious
conviction
that
he
was
right
in
resisting
the
plaintiff
s
demand
he
would
not
be
there
at
all
i
believe
i
state
your
views
correctly
do
i
not
my
dear
sir
said
the
little
man
turning
to
pickwick
quite
so
replied
that
gentleman
serjeant
snubbin
unfolded
his
glasses
raised
them
to
his
eyes
and
after
looking
at
pickwick
for
a
few
seconds
with
great
curiosity
turned
to
perker
and
said
smiling
slightly
as
he
spoke
has
pickwick
a
strong
case
the
attorney
shrugged
his
shoulders
do
you
propose
calling
witnesses
the
smile
on
the
serjeant
s
countenance
became
more
defined
he
rocked
his
leg
with
increased
violence
and
throwing
himself
back
in
his
chair
coughed
dubiously
these
tokens
of
the
serjeant
s
presentiments
on
the
subject
slight
as
they
were
were
not
lost
on
pickwick
he
settled
the
spectacles
through
which
he
had
attentively
regarded
such
demonstrations
of
the
barrister
s
feelings
as
he
had
permitted
himself
to
exhibit
more
firmly
on
his
nose
and
said
with
great
energy
and
in
utter
disregard
of
all
perker
s
admonitory
winkings
and
frownings
my
wishing
to
wait
upon
you
for
such
a
purpose
as
this
sir
appears
i
have
no
doubt
to
a
gentleman
who
sees
so
much
of
these
matters
as
you
must
necessarily
do
a
very
extraordinary
the
serjeant
tried
to
look
gravely
at
the
fire
but
the
smile
came
back
again
gentlemen
of
your
profession
sir
continued
pickwick
see
the
worst
side
of
human
nature
all
its
disputes
all
its
and
bad
blood
rise
up
before
you
you
know
from
your
experience
of
juries
i
mean
no
disparagement
to
you
or
them
how
much
depends
upon
effect
and
you
are
apt
to
attribute
to
others
a
desire
to
use
for
purposes
of
deception
and
the
very
instruments
which
you
in
pure
honesty
and
honour
of
purpose
and
with
a
laudable
desire
to
do
your
utmost
for
your
client
know
the
temper
and
worth
of
so
well
from
constantly
employing
them
yourselves
i
really
believe
that
to
this
circumstance
may
be
attributed
the
vulgar
but
very
general
notion
of
your
being
as
a
body
suspicious
distrustful
and
conscious
as
i
am
sir
of
the
disadvantage
of
making
such
a
declaration
to
you
under
such
circumstances
i
have
come
here
because
i
wish
you
distinctly
to
understand
as
my
friend
perker
has
said
that
i
am
innocent
of
the
falsehood
laid
to
my
charge
and
although
i
am
very
well
aware
of
the
inestimable
value
of
your
assistance
sir
i
must
beg
to
add
that
unless
you
sincerely
believe
this
i
would
rather
be
deprived
of
the
aid
of
your
talents
than
have
the
advantage
of
long
before
the
close
of
this
address
which
we
are
bound
to
say
was
of
a
very
prosy
character
for
pickwick
the
serjeant
had
relapsed
into
a
state
of
abstraction
after
some
minutes
however
during
which
he
had
reassumed
his
pen
he
appeared
to
be
again
aware
of
the
presence
of
his
clients
raising
his
head
from
the
paper
he
said
rather
snappishly
who
is
with
me
in
this
case
mr
phunky
serjeant
snubbin
replied
the
attorney
phunky
phunky
said
the
serjeant
i
never
heard
the
name
before
he
must
be
a
very
young
yes
he
is
a
very
young
man
replied
the
attorney
he
was
only
called
the
other
day
let
me
see
he
has
not
been
at
the
bar
eight
years
ah
i
thought
not
said
the
serjeant
in
that
sort
of
pitying
tone
in
which
ordinary
folks
would
speak
of
a
very
helpless
little
child
mr
mallard
send
round
to
phunky
s
holborn
court
gray
s
inn
interposed
perker
holborn
court
by
the
bye
is
south
square
mr
phunky
and
say
i
should
be
glad
if
he
d
step
here
a
mallard
departed
to
execute
his
commission
and
serjeant
snubbin
relapsed
into
abstraction
until
phunky
himself
was
introduced
although
an
infant
barrister
he
was
a
man
he
had
a
very
nervous
manner
and
a
painful
hesitation
in
his
speech
it
did
not
appear
to
be
a
natural
defect
but
seemed
rather
the
result
of
timidity
arising
from
the
consciousness
of
being
kept
down
by
want
of
means
or
interest
or
connection
or
impudence
as
the
case
might
be
he
was
overawed
by
the
serjeant
and
profoundly
courteous
to
the
attorney
i
have
not
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
before
phunky
said
serjeant
snubbin
with
haughty
condescension
phunky
bowed
he
the
pleasure
of
seeing
the
serjeant
and
of
envying
him
too
with
all
a
poor
man
s
envy
for
eight
years
and
a
quarter
you
are
with
me
in
this
case
i
understand
said
the
serjeant
if
phunky
had
been
a
rich
man
he
would
have
instantly
sent
for
his
clerk
to
remind
him
if
he
had
been
a
wise
one
he
would
have
applied
his
forefinger
to
his
forehead
and
endeavoured
to
recollect
whether
in
the
multiplicity
of
his
engagements
he
had
undertaken
this
one
or
not
but
as
he
was
neither
rich
nor
wise
in
this
sense
at
all
events
he
turned
red
and
bowed
have
you
read
the
papers
phunky
inquired
the
serjeant
here
again
phunky
should
have
professed
to
have
forgotten
all
about
the
merits
of
the
case
but
as
he
had
read
such
papers
as
had
been
laid
before
him
in
the
course
of
the
action
and
had
thought
of
nothing
else
waking
or
sleeping
throughout
the
two
months
during
which
he
had
been
retained
as
serjeant
snubbin
s
junior
he
turned
a
deeper
red
and
bowed
again
this
is
pickwick
said
the
serjeant
waving
his
pen
in
the
direction
in
which
that
gentleman
was
standing
phunky
bowed
to
pickwick
with
a
reverence
which
a
first
client
must
ever
awaken
and
again
inclined
his
head
towards
his
leader
perhaps
you
will
take
pickwick
away
said
the
serjeant
and
hear
anything
pickwick
may
wish
to
communicate
we
shall
have
a
consultation
of
with
that
hint
that
he
had
been
interrupted
quite
long
enough
serjeant
snubbin
who
had
been
gradually
growing
more
and
more
abstracted
applied
his
glass
to
his
eyes
for
an
instant
bowed
slightly
round
and
was
once
more
deeply
immersed
in
the
case
before
him
which
arose
out
of
an
interminable
lawsuit
originating
in
the
act
of
an
individual
deceased
a
century
or
so
ago
who
had
stopped
up
a
pathway
leading
from
some
place
which
nobody
ever
came
from
to
some
other
place
which
nobody
ever
went
to
phunky
would
not
hear
of
passing
through
any
door
until
pickwick
and
his
solicitor
had
passed
through
before
him
so
it
was
some
time
before
they
got
into
the
square
and
when
they
did
reach
it
they
walked
up
and
down
and
held
a
long
conference
the
result
of
which
was
that
it
was
a
very
difficult
matter
to
say
how
the
verdict
would
go
that
nobody
could
presume
to
calculate
on
the
issue
of
an
action
that
it
was
very
lucky
they
had
prevented
the
other
party
from
getting
serjeant
snubbin
and
other
topics
of
doubt
and
consolation
common
in
such
a
position
of
affairs
weller
was
then
roused
by
his
master
from
a
sweet
sleep
of
an
hour
s
duration
and
bidding
adieu
to
lowten
they
returned
to
the
city
chapter
xxxii
describes
far
more
fully
than
the
court
newsman
ever
did
a
bachelor
s
party
given
by
bob
sawyer
at
his
lodgings
in
the
borough
there
is
a
repose
about
lant
street
in
the
borough
which
sheds
a
gentle
melancholy
upon
the
soul
there
are
always
a
good
many
houses
to
let
in
the
street
it
is
a
too
and
its
dulness
is
soothing
a
house
in
lant
street
would
not
come
within
the
denomination
of
a
rate
residence
in
the
strict
acceptation
of
the
term
but
it
is
a
most
desirable
spot
nevertheless
if
a
man
wished
to
abstract
himself
from
the
world
to
remove
himself
from
within
the
reach
of
temptation
to
place
himself
beyond
the
possibility
of
any
inducement
to
look
out
of

to
be
completed

corner

of

on

long

cheerfully

himself
purchased

had
returned

in

in

little
table
covered
with

been
borrowed
from

to

at

all
drawn
up
in

tray
which
was
deposited
on
the
landing
outside
the
door
notwithstanding
the
highly
satisfactory
nature
of
all
these
arrangements
there
was
a
cloud
on
the
countenance
of
bob
sawyer
as
he
sat
by
the
fireside
there
was
a
sympathising
expression
too
in
the
features
of
ben
allen
as
he
gazed
intently
on
the
coals
and
a
tone
of
melancholy
in
his
voice
as
he
said
after
a
long
silence
well
it
is
unlucky
she
should
have
taken
it
in
her
head
to
turn
sour
just
on
this
occasion
she
might
at
least
have
waited
till
that
s
her
malevolence
that
s
her
malevolence
returned
bob
sawyer
vehemently
she
says
that
if
i
can
afford
to
give
a
party
i
ought
to
be
able
to
pay
her
confounded
little
how
long
has
it
been
running
inquired
ben

a
bill
by
the
bye
is
the
most
extraordinary
locomotive
engine
that
the
genius
of
man
ever
produced
it
would
keep
on
running
during
the
longest
lifetime
without
ever
once
stopping
of
its
own
accord
only
a
quarter
and
a
month
or
so
replied
bob
sawyer
ben
allen
coughed
hopelessly
and
directed
a
searching
look
between
the
two
top
bars
of
the
stove
it
ll
be
a
deuced
unpleasant
thing
if
she
takes
it
into
her
head
to
let
out
when
those
fellows
are
here
won
t
it
said
ben
allen
at
length
horrible
replied
bob
sawyer
a
low
tap
was
heard
at
the
room
door
bob
sawyer
looked
expressively
at
his
friend
and
bade
the
tapper
come
in
whereupon
a
dirty
slipshod
girl
in
black
cotton
stockings
who
might
have
passed
for
the
neglected
daughter
of
a
superannuated
dustman
in
very
reduced
circumstances
thrust
in
her
head
and
said
please
mister
sawyer
missis
raddle
wants
to
speak
to
before
bob
sawyer
could
return
any
answer
the
girl
suddenly
disappeared
with
a
jerk
as
if
somebody
had
given
her
a
violent
pull
behind
this
mysterious
exit
was
no
sooner
accomplished
than
there
was
another
tap
at
the
door
a
smart
pointed
tap
which
seemed
to
say
here
i
am
and
in
i
m
bob
sawyer
glanced
at
his
friend
with
a
look
of
abject
apprehension
and
once
more
cried
come
the
permission
was
not
at
all
necessary
for
before
bob
sawyer
had
uttered
the
words
a
little
fierce
woman
bounced
into
the
room
all
in
a
tremble
with
passion
and
pale
with
rage
now
sawyer
said
the
little
fierce
woman
trying
to
appear
very
calm
if
you
ll
have
the
kindness
to
settle
that
little
bill
of
mine
i
ll
thank
you
because
i
ve
got
my
rent
to
pay
this
afternoon
and
my
landlord
s
below
here
the
little
woman
rubbed
her
hands
and
looked
steadily
over
bob
sawyer
s
head
at
the
wall
behind
him
i
am
very
sorry
to
put
you
to
any
inconvenience
raddle
said
bob
sawyer
deferentially
but
oh
it
isn
t
any
inconvenience
replied
the
little
woman
with
a
shrill
titter
i
didn
t
want
it
particular
before
leastways
as
it
has
to
go
to
my
landlord
directly
it
was
as
well
for
you
to
keep
it
as
me
you
promised
me
this
afternoon
sawyer
and
every
gentleman
as
has
ever
lived
here
has
kept
his
word
sir
as
of
course
anybody
as
calls
himself
a
gentleman
raddle
tossed
her
head
bit
her
lips
rubbed
her
hands
harder
and
looked
at
the
wall
more
steadily
than
ever
it
was
plain
to
see
as
bob
sawyer
remarked
in
a
style
of
eastern
allegory
on
a
subsequent
occasion
that
she
was
getting
the
steam
i
am
very
sorry
raddle
said
bob
sawyer
with
all
imaginable
humility
but
the
fact
is
that
i
have
been
disappointed
in
the
city
extraordinary
place
that
city
an
astonishing
number
of
men
always
disappointed
there
well
sawyer
said
raddle
planting
herself
firmly
on
a
purple
cauliflower
in
the
kidderminster
carpet
and
what
s
that
to
me
sir
i
i
have
no
doubt
raddle
said
bob
sawyer
blinking
this
last
question
that
before
the
middle
of
next
week
we
shall
be
able
to
set
ourselves
quite
square
and
go
on
on
a
better
system
this
was
all
raddle
wanted
she
had
bustled
up
to
the
apartment
of
the
unlucky
bob
sawyer
so
bent
upon
going
into
a
passion
that
in
all
probability
payment
would
have
rather
disappointed
her
than
otherwise
she
was
in
excellent
order
for
a
little
relaxation
of
the
kind
having
just
exchanged
a
few
introductory
compliments
with
in
the
front
kitchen
do
you
suppose
sawyer
said
raddle
elevating
her
voice
for
the
information
of
the
neighbours
do
you
suppose
that
i
m
day
after
day
to
let
a
fellar
occupy
my
lodgings
as
never
thinks
of
paying
his
rent
nor
even
the
very
money
laid
out
for
the
fresh
butter
and
lump
sugar
that
s
bought
for
his
breakfast
and
the
very
milk
that
s
took
in
at
the
street
door
do
you
suppose
a
and
industrious
woman
as
has
lived
in
this
street
for
twenty
year
ten
year
over
the
way
and
nine
year
and
in
this
very
house
has
nothing
else
to
do
but
to
work
herself
to
death
after
a
parcel
of
lazy
idle
fellars
that
are
always
smoking
and
drinking
and
lounging
when
they
ought
to
be
glad
to
turn
their
hands
to
anything
that
would
help
em
to
pay
their
bills
do
you
my
good
soul
interposed
benjamin
allen
soothingly
have
the
goodness
to
keep
your
observashuns
to
yourself
sir
i
beg
said
raddle
suddenly
arresting
the
rapid
torrent
of
her
speech
and
addressing
the
third
party
with
impressive
slowness
and
solemnity
i
am
not
aweer
sir
that
you
have
any
right
to
address
your
conversation
to
me
i
don
t
think
i
let
these
apartments
to
you
no
you
certainly
did
not
said
benjamin
allen
very
good
sir
responded
raddle
with
lofty
politeness
then
p
raps
sir
you
ll
confine
yourself
to
breaking
the
arms
and
legs
of
the
poor
people
in
the
hospitals
and
keep
yourself
yourself
sir
or
there
may
be
some
persons
here
as
will
make
you
but
you
are
such
an
unreasonable
woman
remonstrated
benjamin
allen
i
beg
your
parding
young
man
said
raddle
in
a
cold
perspiration
of
anger
but
will
you
have
the
goodness
just
to
call
me
that
again
sir
i
didn
t
make
use
of
the
word
in
any
invidious
sense
ma
am
replied
benjamin
allen
growing
somewhat
uneasy
on
his
own
account
i
beg
your
parding
young
man
demanded
raddle
in
a
louder
and
more
imperative
tone
but
who
do
you
call
a
woman
did
you
make
that
remark
to
me
sir
why
bless
my
heart
said
benjamin
allen
did
you
apply
that
name
to
me
i
ask
of
you
sir
interrupted
raddle
with
intense
fierceness
throwing
the
door
wide
open
why
of
course
i
did
replied
benjamin
allen
yes
of
course
you
did
said
raddle
backing
gradually
to
the
door
and
raising
her
voice
to
its
loudest
pitch
for
the
special
behoof
of
raddle
in
the
kitchen
yes
of
course
you
did
and
everybody
knows
that
they
may
safely
insult
me
in
my
own
ouse
while
my
husband
sits
sleeping
downstairs
and
taking
no
more
notice
than
if
i
was
a
dog
in
the
streets
he
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
himself
here
raddle
sobbed
to
allow
his
wife
to
be
treated
in
this
way
by
a
parcel
of
young
cutters
and
carvers
of
live
people
s
bodies
that
disgraces
the
lodgings
another
sob
and
leaving
her
exposed
to
all
manner
of
abuse
a
base
timorous
wretch
that
s
afraid
to
come
upstairs
and
face
the
ruffinly
creatures
that
s
afraid
that
s
afraid
to
come
raddle
paused
to
listen
whether
the
repetition
of
the
taunt
had
roused
her
better
half
and
finding
that
it
had
not
been
successful
proceeded
to
descend
the
stairs
with
sobs
innumerable
when
there
came
a
loud
double
knock
at
the
street
door
whereupon
she
burst
into
an
hysterical
fit
of
weeping
accompanied
with
dismal
moans
which
was
prolonged
until
the
knock
had
been
repeated
six
times
when
in
an
uncontrollable
burst
of
mental
agony
she
threw
down
all
the
umbrellas
and
disappeared
into
the
back
parlour
closing
the
door
after
her
with
an
awful
crash
does

live
here
said
pickwick
when
the
door
was
opened

given
this
instruction
the
handmaid
who
had
been
brought
up
among
the
aboriginal
inhabitants
of
southwark
disappeared
with
the
candle
in
her
hand
down
the
kitchen
stairs
perfectly
satisfied
that
she
had
done
everything
that
could
possibly
be
required
of
her
under
the
circumstances
snodgrass
who
entered
last
secured
the
street
door
after
several
ineffectual
efforts
by
putting
up
the
chain
and
the
friends
stumbled
upstairs
where
they
were
received
by
bob
sawyer
who
had
been
afraid
to
go
down
lest
he
should
be
waylaid
by
raddle
how
are
you
said
the
discomfited
student
glad
to
see
you
take
care
of
the
this
caution
was
addressed
to
pickwick

had
put
his
hat
in

tray

pickwick
shook
hands
with
benjamin
allen
and
his
friends
followed
his
example
they
had
scarcely
taken
their
seats
when
there
was
another
double
knock

bob

a
heavy
footstep
was
heard
upon

stairs
and
jack

presented

buttons
and

splendid
operation
though
magnificent
sight
if

pickwick

ate
five
apples
and
a
gingerbread
cake
exactly

minutes

hopkins
with
a
scarcely
perceptible
glance
at

attentive
face

jack

too
much
you
couldn

swallow
that
if
the
child
did
eh
pickwick
ha

hopkins
appeared
highly
gratified
with
his
own
pleasantry
and
continued
no

way

child

parents

poor
people
who
lived
in
a
court

eldest
sister

the
day
after

on
till
in
a
week
s
time
he
had
got
through
the
necklace

in
all
the
sister
who
was
an
industrious
girl
and
seldom
treated
herself
to
a
bit
of
finery
cried
her
eyes
out
at
the
loss
of
the
necklace
looked
high
and
low
for
it
but
i
needn
t
say

find
it
a
few
days
afterwards
the
family
were
at
dinner
baked
shoulder
of
mutton
and
potatoes
under
it
the
child
who
wasn
t
hungry
was
playing
about
the
room
when
suddenly
there
was
heard
a
devil
of
a
noise
like
a
small
hailstorm
don

do
that
my
boy
said
the
father
i
ain
t
nothing
said
the
child
well
don
t
do
it
again
said
the
father
there
was
a
short
silence
and
then
the
noise
began
again
worse
than
ever
if
you
don
t
mind
what
i
say
my
boy
said
the
father
you
ll
find
yourself
in
bed
in
something
less
than
a
pig
s
he
gave
the
child
a
shake
to
make
him
obedient
and
such
a
rattling
ensued
as
nobody
ever
heard
before
why
damme
it

the
child
said
the
father
he

got
the
croup
in
the

place

the
child
beginning
to
cry

swallowed
it
the
father
caught
the
child
up
and
ran
with
him
to
the
hospital
the
beads
in
the
boy
s
stomach
rattling
all
the
way
with
the
jolting
and
the
people
looking
up
in
the
air
and
down
in
the
cellars
to
see
where
the
unusual
sound
came
from
he
s
in
the
hospital
now
said
jack
hopkins
and
he
makes
such
a
devil
of
a
noise
when
he
walks
about
that
they
re
obliged
to
muffle
him
in
a
watchman
s
coat
for
fear
he
should
wake
the
that
s
the
most
extraordinary
case
i
ever
heard
of

pickwick
with
an
emphatic
blow
on
the
table
oh

sir
said
hopkins
so
i
should
be
disposed
to
imagine
replied
pickwick
another
knock
at
the
door
announced
a
young
man
in
a
black
wig
who
brought
with
him
a
scorbutic
youth
in
a
long
stock
the
next
comer
was
a
gentleman
in
a
shirt
emblazoned
with
pink
anchors
who
was
closely
followed
by
a
pale
youth
with
a
plated
watchguard
the
arrival
of
a
prim
personage
in
clean
linen
and
cloth
boots
rendered
the
party
complete
the
little
table
with
the
green
baize
cover
was
wheeled
out
the
first
instalment
of
punch
was
brought
in
in
a
white
jug
and
the
succeeding
three
hours
were
devoted
to
at
sixpence
a
dozen
which
was
only
once
interrupted
by
a
slight
dispute
between
the
scorbutic
youth
and
the
gentleman
with
the
pink
anchors
in
the
course
of
which
the
scorbutic
youth
intimated
a
burning
desire
to
pull
the
nose
of
the
gentleman
with
the
emblems
of
hope
in
reply
to
which
that
individual
expressed
his
decided
unwillingness
to
accept
of
any
sauce
on
gratuitous
terms
either
from
the
irascible
young
gentleman
with
the
scorbutic
countenance
or
any
other
person
who
was
ornamented
with
a
head
when
the
last
natural
had
been
declared
and
the
profit
and
loss
account
of
fish
and
sixpences
adjusted
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
parties
bob
sawyer
rang
for
supper
and
the
visitors
squeezed
themselves
into
corners
while
it
was
getting
ready
it
was
not
so
easily
got
ready
as
some
people
may
imagine
first
of
all
it
was
necessary
to
awaken
the
girl
who
had
fallen
asleep
with
her
face
on
the
kitchen
table
this
took
a
little
time
and
even
when
she
did
answer
the
bell
another
quarter
of
an
hour
was
consumed
in
fruitless
endeavours
to
impart
to
her
a
faint
and
distant
glimmering
of
reason
the
man
to
whom
the
order
for
the
oysters
had
been
sent
had
not
been
told
to
open
them
it
is
a
very
difficult
thing
to
open
an
oyster
with
a
limp
knife
and
a
fork
and
very
little
was
done
in
this
way
very
little
of
the
beef
was
done
either
and
the
ham
which
was
also
from
the
shop
round
the
corner
was
in
a
similar
predicament
however
there
was
plenty
of
porter
in
a
tin
can
and
the
cheese
went
a
great
way
for
it
was
very
strong
so
upon
the
whole
perhaps
the
supper
was
quite
as
good
as
such
matters
usually
are
after
supper
another
jug
of
punch
was
put
upon
the
table
together
with
a
paper
of
cigars
and
a
couple
of
bottles
of
spirits
then
there
was
an
awful
pause
and
this
awful
pause
was
occasioned
by
a
very
common
occurrence
in
this
sort
of
place
but
a
very
embarrassing
one
notwithstanding
the
fact
is
the
girl
was
washing
the
glasses
the
establishment
boasted
four
we
do
not
record
the
circumstance
as
at
all
derogatory
to
raddle
for
there
never
was
a
yet
that
was
not
short
of
glasses
the
landlady
s
glasses
were
little
thin
tumblers
and
those
which
had
been
borrowed
from
the
were
great
dropsical
bloated
articles
each
supported
on
a
huge
gouty
leg
this
would
have
been
in
itself
sufficient
to
have
possessed
the
company
with
the
real
state
of
affairs
but
the
young
woman
of
all
work
had
prevented
the
possibility
of
any
misconception
arising
in
the
mind
of
any
gentleman
upon
the
subject
by
forcibly
dragging
every
man
s
glass
away
long
before
he
had
finished
his
beer
and
audibly
stating
despite
the
winks
and
interruptions
of
bob
sawyer
that
it
was
to
be
conveyed
downstairs
and
washed
forthwith
it
is
a
very
ill
wind
that
blows
nobody
any
good
the
prim
man
in
the
cloth
boots
who
had
been
unsuccessfully
attempting
to
make
a
joke
during
the
whole
time
the
round
game
lasted
saw
his
opportunity
and
availed
himself
of
it
the
instant
the
glasses
disappeared
he
commenced
a
long
story
about
a
great
public
character
whose
name
he
had
forgotten
making
a
particularly
happy
reply
to
another
eminent
and
illustrious
individual
whom
he
had
never
been
able
to
identify
he
enlarged
at
some
length
and
with
great
minuteness
upon
divers
collateral
circumstances
distantly
connected
with
the
anecdote
in
hand
but
for
the
life
of
him
he
couldn
t
recollect
at
that
precise
moment
what
the
anecdote
was
although
he
had
been
in
the
habit
of
telling
the
story
with
great
applause
for
the
last
ten
years
dear
me
said
the
prim
man
in
the
cloth
boots
it
is
a
very
extraordinary
i
am
sorry
you
have
forgotten
it
said
bob
sawyer
glancing
eagerly
at
the
door
as
he
thought
he
heard
the
noise
of
glasses
jingling
very
so
am
i
responded
the
prim
man
because
i
know
it
would
have
afforded
so
much
amusement
never
mind
i
dare
say
i
shall
manage
to
recollect
it
in
the
course
of
half
an
hour
or
the
prim
man
arrived
at
this
point
just
as
the
glasses
came
back
when
bob
sawyer
who
had
been
absorbed
in
attention
during
the
whole
time
said
he
should
very
much
like
to
hear
the
end
of
it
for
so
far
as
it
went
it
was
without
exception
the
very
best
story
he
had
ever
heard
the
sight
of
the
tumblers
restored
bob
sawyer
to
a
degree
of
equanimity
which
he
had
not
possessed
since
his
interview
with
his
landlady
his
face
brightened
up
and
he
began
to
feel
quite
convivial
now
betsy
said
bob
sawyer
with
great
suavity
and
dispersing
at
the
same
time
the
tumultuous
little
mob
of
glasses
the
girl
had
collected
in
the
centre
of
the
table
now
betsy
the
warm
water
be
brisk
there
s
a
good
you
can
t
have
no
warm
water
replied
betsy
no
warm
water
exclaimed
bob
sawyer
no
said
the
girl
with
a
shake
of
the
head
which
expressed
a
more
decided
negative
than
the
most
copious
language
could
have
conveyed
missis
raddle
said
you
warn
t
to
have
the
surprise
depicted
on
the
countenances
of
his
guests
imparted
new
courage
to
the
host
bring
up
the
warm
water
instantly
instantly
said
bob
sawyer
with
desperate
sternness
no
i
can
t
replied
the
girl
missis
raddle
raked
out
the
kitchen
fire
afore
she
went
to
bed
and
locked
up
the
oh
never
mind
never
mind
pray
don
t
disturb
yourself
about
such
a
trifle
said
pickwick
observing
the
conflict
of
bob
sawyer
s
passions
as
depicted
in
his
countenance
cold
water
will
do
very
oh
admirably
said
benjamin
allen
my
landlady
is
subject
to
some
slight
attacks
of
mental
derangement
remarked
bob
sawyer
with
a
ghastly
smile
i
fear
i
must
give
her
no
don

said
ben
allen
i
fear
i
must
said
bob
with
heroic
firmness
i
ll
pay
her
what
i
owe
her
and
give
her
warning
poor
fellow
how
devoutly
he
wished
he
could
bob
sawyer
s
attempts
to
rally
under
this
last
blow
communicated
a
dispiriting
influence
to
the
company
the
greater
part
of
whom
with
the
view
of
raising
their
spirits
attached
themselves
with
extra
cordiality
to
the
cold
the
first
perceptible
effects
of
which
were
displayed
in
a
renewal
of
hostilities
between
the
scorbutic
youth
and
the
gentleman
in
the
shirt
the
belligerents
vented
their
feelings
of
mutual
contempt
for
some
time
in
a
variety
of
frownings
and
snortings
until
at
last
the
scorbutic
youth
felt
it
necessary
to
come
to
a
more
explicit
understanding
on
the
matter
when
the
following
clear
understanding
took
place
sawyer
said
the
scorbutic
youth
in
a
loud
voice
well
noddy
replied
bob
sawyer
i
should
be
very
sorry
sawyer
said
noddy
to
create
any
unpleasantness
at
any
friend
s
table
and
much
less
at
yours
sawyer
very
but
i
must
take
this
opportunity
of
informing
gunter
that
he
is
no
and
i
should
be
very
sorry
sawyer
to
create
any
disturbance
in
the
street
in
which
you
reside
said
gunter
but
i
m
afraid
i
shall
be
under
the
necessity
of
alarming
the
neighbours
by
throwing
the
person
who
has
just
spoken
out
o
what
do
you
mean
by
that
sir
inquired
noddy
what
i
say
sir
replied
gunter
i
should
like
to
see
you
do
it
sir
said
noddy
you
shall
do
it
in
half
a
minute
sir
replied
gunter
i
request
that
you
ll
favour
me
with
your
card
sir
said
noddy
i
ll
do
nothing
of
the
kind
sir
replied
gunter
why
not
sir
inquired
noddy
because
you
ll
stick
it
up
over
your
and
delude
your
visitors
into
the
false
belief
that
a
gentleman
has
been
to
see
you
sir
replied
gunter
sir
a
friend
of
mine
shall
wait
on
you
in
the
morning
said
noddy
sir
i
m
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
the
caution
and
i
ll
leave
particular
directions
with
the
servant
to
lock
up
the
spoons
replied
gunter
at
this
point
the
remainder
of
the
guests
interposed
and
remonstrated
with
both
parties
on
the
impropriety
of
their
conduct
on
which
noddy
begged
to
state
that
his
father
was
quite
as
respectable
as
gunter
s
father
to
which
gunter
replied
that
his
father
was
to
the
full
as
respectable
as
noddy
s
father
and
that
his
father
s
son
was
as
good
a
man
as
noddy
any
day
in
the
week
as
this
announcement
seemed
the
prelude
to
a
recommencement
of
the
dispute
there
was
another
interference
on
the
part
of
the
company
and
a
vast
quantity
of
talking
and
clamouring
ensued
in
the
course
of
which
noddy
gradually
allowed
his
feelings
to
overpower
him
and
professed
that
he
had
ever
entertained
a
devoted
personal
attachment
towards
gunter
to
this
gunter
replied
that
upon
the
whole
he
rather
preferred
noddy
to
his
own
brother
on
hearing
which
admission
noddy
magnanimously
rose
from
his
seat
and
proffered
his
hand
to
gunter
gunter
grasped
it
with
affecting
fervour
and
everybody
said
that
the
whole
dispute
had
been
conducted
in
a
manner
which
was
highly
honourable
to
both
parties
concerned
now
said
jack
hopkins
just
to
set
us
going
again
bob
i
don
t
mind
singing
a
and
hopkins
incited
thereto
by
tumultuous
applause
plunged
himself
at
once
into
the
king
god
bless
him
which
he
sang
as
loud
as
he
could
to
a
novel
air
compounded
of
the
bay
of
biscay
and
a
frog
he
the
chorus
was
the
essence
of
the
song
and
as
each
gentleman
sang
it
to
the
tune
he
knew
best
the
effect
was
very
striking
indeed
it
was
at
the
end
of
the
chorus
to
the
first
verse
that
pickwick
held
up
his
hand
in
a
listening
attitude
and
said
as
soon
as
silence
was
restored
hush
i
beg
your
pardon
i
thought
i
heard
somebody
calling
from
a
profound
silence
immediately
ensued
and
bob
sawyer
was
observed
to
turn
pale
i
think
i
hear
it
now
said
pickwick
have
the
goodness
to
open
the
the
door
was
no
sooner
opened
than
all
doubt
on
the
subject
was
removed
mr
sawyer
sawyer
screamed
a
voice
from
the
landing
it
s
my
landlady
said
bob
sawyer
looking
round
him
with
great
dismay
yes
what
do
you
mean
by
this
sawyer
replied
the
voice
with
great
shrillness
and
rapidity
of
utterance
ain
t
it
enough
to
be
swindled
out
of
one
s
rent
and
money
lent
out
of
pocket
besides
and
abused
and
insulted
by
your
friends
that
dares
to
call
themselves
men
without
having
the
house
turned
out
of
the
window
and
noise
enough
made
to
bring
the
here
at
two
o
clock
in
the
morning
turn
them
wretches
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourselves
said
the
voice
of
raddle
which
appeared
to
proceed
from
beneath
some
distant
ashamed
of
themselves
said
raddle
why
don
t
you
go
down
and
knock
em
every
one
downstairs
you
would
if
you
was
a
i
should
if
i
was
a
dozen
men
my
dear
replied
raddle
pacifically
but
they
have
the
advantage
of
me
in
numbers
my
ugh
you
coward
replied
raddle
with
supreme
contempt
you
mean
to
turn
them
wretches
out
or
not
sawyer
they
re
going
raddle
they
re
going
said
the
miserable
bob
i
am
afraid
you
d
better
go
said
bob
sawyer
to
his
friends
i
thought
you
were
making
too
much
it
s
a
very
unfortunate
thing
said
the
prim
man
just
as
we
were
getting
so
comfortable
too
the
prim
man
was
just
beginning
to
have
a
dawning
recollection
of
the
story
he
had
forgotten
it
s
hardly
to
be
borne
said
the
prim
man
looking
round
hardly
to
be
borne
is
it
not
to
be
endured
replied
jack
hopkins
let
s
have
the
other
verse
bob
come
here
goes
no
no
jack
don
t
interposed
bob
sawyer
it
s
a
capital
song
but
i
am
afraid
we
had
better
not
have
the
other
verse
they
are
very
violent
people
the
people
of
the
shall
i
step
upstairs
and
pitch
into
the
landlord
inquired
hopkins
or
keep
on
ringing
the
bell
or
go
and
groan
on
the
staircase
you
may
command
me
i
am
very
much
indebted
to
you
for
your
friendship
and
hopkins
said
the
wretched
bob
sawyer
but
i
think
the
best
plan
to
avoid
any
further
dispute
is
for
us
to
break
up
at
now
sawyer
screamed
the
shrill
voice
of
raddle
are
them
brutes
going
they
re
only
looking
for
their
hats
raddle
said
bob
they
are
going
going
said
raddle
thrusting
her
nightcap
over
the
banisters
just
as
pickwick
followed
by
tupman
emerged
from
the
room
going
what
did
they
ever
come
for
my
dear
ma
am
remonstrated
pickwick
looking
up
get
along
with
you
old
wretch
replied
raddle
hastily
withdrawing
the
nightcap
old
enough
to
be
his
grandfather
you
willin
you
re
worse
than
any
of
pickwick
found
it
in
vain
to
protest
his
innocence
so
hurried
downstairs
into
the
street
whither
he
was
closely
followed
by
tupman
winkle
and
snodgrass
ben
allen
who
was
dismally
depressed
with
spirits
and
agitation
accompanied
them
as
far
as
london
bridge
and
in
the
course
of
the
walk
confided
to
winkle
as
an
especially
eligible
person
to
intrust
the
secret
to
that
he
was
resolved
to
cut
the
throat
of
any
gentleman
except
bob
sawyer
who
should
aspire
to
the
affections
of
his
sister
arabella
having
expressed
his
determination
to
perform
this
painful
duty
of
a
brother
with
proper
firmness
he
burst
into
tears
knocked
his
hat
over
his
eyes
and
making
the
best
of
his
way
back
knocked
double
knocks
at
the
door
of
the
borough
market
office
and
took
short
naps
on
the
steps
alternately
until
daybreak
under
the
firm
impression
that
he
lived
there
and
had
forgotten
the
key
the
visitors
having
all
departed
in
compliance
with
the
rather
pressing
request
of
raddle
the
luckless
bob
sawyer
was
left
alone
to
meditate
on
the
probable
events
of
and
the
pleasures
of

small
instalment
of

to
the
account
of
the
reverend
gentleman
with

nose
the
morning
of
the
thirteenth
of
february
which
the
readers
of
this
authentic
narrative
know
as
well
as
we
do
to
have
been
the
day
immediately
preceding
that
which
was
appointed
for
the
trial
of
bardell
s
action
was
a
busy
time
for
samuel

who
was
perpetually
engaged
in
travelling
from

to
perker
s
chambers
and
back
again
from
and
between
the
hours

consultation

taken
place
and
the
course
of
proceeding
to
be
adopted
had
been
finally
determined
on
but
pickwick
being
in
a
most
extreme
state
of
excitement
persevered
in
constantly
sending
small
notes
to
his
attorney
merely
containing
the
inquiry

all
going
on
well
to
which
perker
invariably
forwarded
the
reply
dear
pickwick
as
well
as
possible
the
fact
being
as
we
have
already
hinted
that
there
was
nothing
whatever
to
go
on
either
well
or
ill
until
the
sitting
of
the
court
on
the
following
morning
but
people
who
go
voluntarily
to
law
or
are
taken
forcibly
there
for
the
first
time
may
be
allowed
to
labour
under
some
temporary
irritation
and
anxiety
and
sam
with
a
due
allowance
for
the
frailties
of
human
nature
obeyed
all
his
master
s
behests
with
that
imperturbable
humour
and
unruffable
composure
which
formed
one
of
his
most
striking
and
amiable
characteristics
sam
had
solaced
himself
with
a
most
agreeable
little
dinner
and
was
waiting
at
the
bar
for
the
glass
of
warm
mixture
in
which
pickwick
had
requested
him
to
drown
the
fatigues
of
his
morning
s
walks
when
a
young
boy
of
about
three
feet
high
or
thereabouts
in
a
hairy
cap
and
fustian
overalls
whose
garb
bespoke
a
laudable
ambition
to
attain
in
time
the
elevation
of
an
hostler
entered
the
passage
of
the
george
and
vulture
and
looked
first
up
the
stairs
and
then
along
the
passage
and
then
into
the
bar
as
if
in
search
of
somebody
to
whom
he
bore
a
commission
whereupon
the
barmaid
conceiving
it
not
improbable
that
the
said
commission
might
be
directed
to
the
tea
or
table
spoons
of
the
establishment
accosted
the
boy
with
now
young
man
what
do
you
want
is
there
anybody
here
named
sam
inquired
the
youth
in
a
loud
voice
of
treble
quality
what
s
the
t
other
name
said
sam
weller
looking
round
how
should
i
know
briskly
replied
the
young
gentleman
below
the
hairy
cap
you
re
a
sharp
boy
you
are
said
weller
only
i
wouldn
t
show
that
wery
fine
edge
too
much
if
i
was
you
in
case
anybody
took
it
off
what
do
you
mean
by
comin
to
a
and
asking
arter
sam
vith
as
much
politeness
as
a
vild
indian
cos
an
old
gen
l
m
n
told
me
to
replied
the
boy
what
old
gen
l
m
n
inquired
sam
with
deep
disdain
him
as
drives
a
ipswich
coach
and
uses
our
parlour
rejoined
the
boy
he
told
me
yesterday
mornin
to
come
to
the
george
and
wultur
this
arternoon
and
ask
for
it
s
my
father
my
dear
said
weller
turning
with
an
explanatory
air
to
the
young
lady
in
the
bar
blessed
if
i
think
he
hardly
knows
wot
my
other
name
is
well
young
brockiley
sprout
wot
then
why
then
said
the
boy
you
was
to
come
to
him
at
six
o
clock
to
our
ouse
cos
he
wants
to
see
you
blue
boar
leaden
all
markit
shall
i
say
you
re
comin
you
may
wenture
on
that
ere
statement
sir
replied
sam
and
thus
empowered
the
young
gentleman
walked
away
awakening
all
the
echoes
in
george
yard
as
he
did
so
with
several
chaste
and
extremely
correct
imitations
of
a
drover
s
whistle
delivered
in
a
tone
of
peculiar
richness
and
volume
weller
having
obtained
leave
of
absence
from
pickwick
who
in
his
then
state
of
excitement
and
worry
was
by
no
means
displeased
at
being
left
alone
set
forth
long
before
the
appointed
hour
and
having
plenty
of
time
at
his
disposal
sauntered
down
as
far
as
the
mansion
house
where
he
paused
and
contemplated
with
a
face
of
great
calmness
and
philosophy
the
numerous
cads
and
drivers
of
short
stages
who
assemble
near
that
famous
place
of
resort
to
the
great
terror
and
confusion
of
the
population
of
these
realms
having
loitered
here
for
half
an
hour
or
so
weller
turned
and
began
wending
his
way
towards
leadenhall
market
through
a
variety
of
and
courts
as
he
was
sauntering
away
his
spare
time
and
stopped
to
look
at
almost
every
object
that
met
his
gaze
it
is
by
no
means
surprising
that
weller
should
have
paused
before
a
small
stationer
s
and
seller
s
window
but
without
further
explanation
it
does
appear
surprising
that
his
eyes
should
have
no
sooner
rested
on
certain
pictures
which
were
exposed
for
sale
therein
than
he
gave
a
sudden
start
smote
his
right
leg
with
great
vehemence
and
exclaimed
with
energy
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
this
i
should
ha
forgot
all
about
it
till
it
was
too
late
the
particular
picture
on
which
sam
weller
s
eyes
were
fixed
as
he
said
this
was
a
representation
of
a
couple
of
human
hearts
skewered
together
with
an
arrow
cooking
before
a
cheerful
fire
while
a
male
and
female
cannibal
in
modern
attire
the
gentleman
being
clad
in
a
blue
coat
and
white
trousers
and
the
lady
in
a
deep
red
pelisse
with
a
parasol
of
the
same
were
approaching
the
meal
with
hungry
eyes
up
a
serpentine
gravel
path
leading
thereunto
a
decidedly
indelicate
young
gentleman
in
a
pair
of
wings
and
nothing
else
was
depicted
as
superintending
the
cooking
a
representation
of
the
spire
of
the
church
in
langham
place
london
appeared
in
the
distance
and
the
whole
formed
a
valentine
of
which
as
a
written
inscription
in
the
window
testified
there
was
a
large
assortment
within
which
the
shopkeeper
pledged
himself
to
dispose
of
to
his
countrymen
generally
at
the
reduced
rate
of
each
i
should
ha
forgot
it
i
should
certainly
ha
forgot
it
said
sam
so
saying
he
at
once
stepped
into
the
stationer
s
shop
and
requested
to
be
served
with
a
sheet
of
the
best
and
a
nibbed
pen
which
could
be
warranted
not
to
splutter
these
articles
having
been
promptly
supplied
he
walked
on
direct
towards
leadenhall
market
at
a
good
round
pace
very
different
from
his
recent
lingering
one
looking
round
him
he
there
beheld
a
signboard
on
which
the
painter
s
art
had
delineated
something
remotely
resembling
a
cerulean
elephant
with
an
aquiline
nose
in
lieu
of
trunk
rightly
conjecturing
that
this
was
the
blue
boar
himself
he
stepped
into
the
house
and
inquired
concerning
his
parent
he
won
t
be
here
this
of
an
hour
or
more
said
the
young
lady
who
superintended
the
domestic
arrangements
of
the
blue
boar
wery
good
my
dear
replied
sam
let
me
have
oth
o
luke
and
the
inkstand
will
you
miss
the
luke
and
the
inkstand
having
been
carried
into
the
little
parlour
and
the
young
lady
having
carefully
flattened
down
the
coals
to
prevent
their
blazing
and
carried
away
the
poker
to
preclude
the
possibility
of
the
fire
being
stirred
without
the
full
privity
and
concurrence
of
the
blue
boar
being
first
had
and
obtained
sam
weller
sat
himself
down
in
a
box
near
the
stove
and
pulled
out
the
sheet
of
and
the
pen
then
looking
carefully
at
the
pen
to
see
that
there
were
no
hairs
in
it
and
dusting
down
the
table
so
that
there
might
be
no
crumbs
of
bread
under
the
paper
sam
tucked
up
the
cuffs
of
his
coat
squared
his
elbows
and
composed
himself
to
write
to
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
are
not
in
the
habit
of
devoting
themselves
practically
to
the
science
of
penmanship
writing
a
letter
is
no
very
easy
task
it
being
always
considered
necessary
in
such
cases
for
the
writer
to
recline
his
head
on
his
left
arm
so
as
to
place
his
eyes
as
nearly
as
possible
on
a
level
with
the
paper
and
while
glancing
sideways
at
the
letters
he
is
constructing
to
form
with
his
tongue
imaginary
characters
to
correspond
these
motions
although
unquestionably
of
the
greatest
assistance
to
original
composition
retard
in
some
degree
the
progress
of
the
writer
and
sam
had
unconsciously
been
a
full
hour
and
a
half
writing
words
in
small
text
smearing
out
wrong
letters
with
his
little
finger
and
putting
in
new
ones
which
required
going
over
very
often
to
render
them
visible
through
the
old
blots
when
he
was
roused
by
the
opening
of
the
door
and
the
entrance
of
his
parent

said
the
father

his

for

off
its

about
that
i
know
you

a
judge
of
these
things
order
in
your
pipe
and
i
ll
read
you
the
letter
there
we
can
not
distinctly
say
whether
it
was
the
prospect
of
the
pipe
or
the
consolatory
reflection
that
a
fatal
disposition
to
get
married
ran
in
the
family
and
couldn
t
be
helped
which
calmed
weller
s
feelings
and
caused
his
grief
to
subside
we
should
be
rather
disposed
to
say
that
the
result
was
attained
by
combining
the
two
sources
of
consolation
for
he
repeated
the
second
in
a
low
tone
very
frequently
ringing
the
bell
meanwhile
to
order
in
the
first
he
then
divested
himself
of
his
upper
coat
and
lighting
the
pipe
and
placing
himself
in

of
the
fire
with
his
back
towards
it
so
that
he
could
feel
its
full
heat
and
recline
against

at
the

time

towards
sam
and
with
a
countenance
greatly
mollified
by
the
softening
influence
of
tobacco
requested
him
to
fire
sam
dipped
his
pen
into
the

to
be
ready
for

and
he

only
a
cambervell
man
so
even
that
s
no
but
sam
was
not
to
be
dissuaded
from
the
poetical
idea
that
had
occurred
to
him
so
he
signed
the
letter
your
and
having
folded
it
in
a
very
intricate
manner
squeezed
a
downhill
direction
in
one
corner
to
mary
housemaid
at
nupkins
s
mayor
s
ipswich
suffolk
and
put
it
into

wafered
and
ready
for
the
general
post
this
important
business
having
been
transacted
weller
the

proceeded
to

that
on
which
he
had
summoned

to
his

or
p
rhaps
to

i

in
my

and
he
may

sammy
i

either
for

but
my
adwice
ud

here
never

the
character
and
stick
to
the
alleybi
nothing
like
a
alleybi
sammy
weller
looked
very
profound
as
he
delivered
this
legal
opinion
and
burying
his
nose
in
his
tumbler
winked
over
the
top
thereof
at
his
astonished
son
why
what
do
you
mean
said
sam
you
don

he

ven
all
the

vigs
to
a

said
as
nothing

him
and
my
pinion
is
sammy
that
if
your
governor
don
t
prove
a
alleybi
he
ll
be
what
the
italians
call
reg
larly
flummoxed
and
that
s
all
about
as
the
elder
weller
entertained
a
firm
and
unalterable
conviction
that
the
old
bailey
was
the
supreme
court
of
judicature
in
this
country
and
that
its
rules
and
forms
of
proceeding
regulated
and
controlled
the
practice
of
all
other
courts
of
justice
whatsoever
he
totally
disregarded
the
assurances
and
arguments
of
his
son
tending
to
show
that
the
alibi
was
inadmissible
and
vehemently
protested
that
pickwick
was
being
finding
that
it
was
of
no
use
to
discuss
the
matter
further
sam
changed
the
subject
and
inquired
what
the
second
topic
was
on
which
his
revered
parent
wished
to
consult
him
that
s
a
pint
o
domestic
policy

with
great
glee
and
winked

indefatigably
after
doing
so
that
sam
began
to
think
he
must
have
got
the
in
his
right
eyelid

said
that
young
gentleman

his
progenitor
looking

very
cautiously
you

i

go
punctiwal
to
the
time
the
won
t
sammy
the
won
here
weller
was
seized
with
a
paroxysm
of
chuckles
which
gradually
terminated
in
as
near
an
approach
to
a
choke
as
an
elderly
gentleman
can
with
safety
sustain
well
i
never
see
sitch
an
old
ghost
in
all
my
born
days
exclaimed
sam
rubbing
the
old
gentleman
s
back
hard
enough
to
set
him
on
fire
with
the
friction
what
are
you
at
corpilence
hush
sammy
said
weller
looking
round
him
with
increased
caution
and
speaking
in
a
whisper
two
friends
o
mine
as

the
oxford
road

at
the
markis
o
granby
dorkin
and
that
s
not
sayin
a
little
and
with
this
weller
once
more
laughed
immoderately
and
once
more
relapsed
into
a
state
of
partial
suffocation
in
consequence
nothing
could
have
been
more
in
accordance
with
sam
weller
s
feelings
than
the
projected
exposure
of
the
real
propensities
and
qualities
of
the
man
and
it
being
very
near
the
appointed
hour
of
meeting
the
father
and
son
took
their
way
at
once
to
brick
lane
sam
not
forgetting
to
drop
his
letter
into
a
general
as
they
walked
along
the
monthly
meetings
of
the
brick
lane
branch
of
the
united
grand
junction
ebenezer
temperance
association
were
held
in
a
large
room
pleasantly
and
airily
situated
at
the
top
of
a
safe
and
commodious
ladder
the
president
was
the
anthony
humm
a
converted
fireman
now
a
schoolmaster
and
occasionally
an
itinerant
preacher
and
the
secretary
was
jonas
mudge
chandler
s
shopkeeper
an
enthusiastic
and
disinterested
vessel
who
sold
tea
to
the
members
previous
to
the
commencement
of
business
the
ladies
sat
upon
forms
and
drank
tea
till
such
time
as
they
considered
it
expedient
to
leave
off
and
a
large
wooden
was
conspicuously
placed
upon
the
green
baize
cloth
of
the
behind
which
the
secretary
stood
and
acknowledged
with
a
gracious
smile
every
addition
to
the
rich
vein
of
copper
which
lay
concealed
within
on
this
particular
occasion
the
women
drank
tea
to
a
most
alarming
extent
greatly
to
the
horror
of
weller
senior
who
utterly
regardless
of
all
sam
s
admonitory
nudgings
stared
about
him
in
every
direction
with
the
most
undisguised
astonishment
sammy
whispered
weller

these
here
people

sam
it

here

sammy
said
weller
in
the
same
low
voice
i
shall
feel
it
my
duty
as
a
human
bein
to
rise
and
address
the
cheer
there

two
as

drunk
nine
breakfast
cups
and
a
half
and
she
s
wisibly
before
my
wery
there
is
little
doubt
that
weller
would
have
carried
his
benevolent
intention
into
immediate
execution
if
a
great
noise
occasioned
by
putting
up
the
cups
and
saucers
had
not
very
fortunately
announced
that
the
was
over
the
crockery
having
been
removed
the
table
with
the
green
baize
cover
was
carried
out
into
the
centre
of
the
room
and
the
business
of
the
evening
was
commenced
by
a
little
emphatic
man
with
a
bald
head
and
drab
shorts
who
suddenly
rushed
up
the
ladder
at
the
imminent
peril
of
snapping
the
two
little
legs
incased
in
the
drab
shorts
and
said
ladies
and
gentlemen
i
move
our
excellent
brother
anthony
humm
into
the
the
ladies
waved
a
choice
selection
of
at
this
proposition
and
the
impetuous
little
man
literally
moved
humm
into
the
chair
by
taking
him
by
the
shoulders
and
thrusting
him
into
a
which
had
once
represented
that
article
of
furniture
the
waving
of
handkerchiefs
was
renewed
and
humm
who
was
a
sleek
man
in
a
perpetual
perspiration
bowed
meekly
to
the
great
admiration
of
the
females
and
formally
took
his
seat
silence
was
then
proclaimed
by
the
little
man
in
the
drab
shorts
and
humm
rose
and
said
that
with
the
permission
of
his
brick
lane
branch
brothers
and
sisters
then
and
there
present
the
secretary
would
read
the
report
of
the
brick
lane
branch
committee
a
proposition
which
was
again
received
with
a
demonstration
of
the
secretary
having
sneezed
in
a
very
impressive
manner
and
the
cough
which
always
seizes
an
assembly
when
anything
particular
is
going
to
be
done
having
been
duly
performed
the
following
document
was
read

of

not

but
thinks
it
very
likely
that

he
had

since
she

did
that
he
drank
the
contents

very
low
and
melancholy

very
feverish

of

jolly
young

to
the
tune
of
the
old
hundredth
which
he
would
request
them
to
join
him
in
singing
great
applause
he
might
take
that
opportunity
of
expressing
his
firm
persuasion
that
the
late
dibdin
seeing
the
errors
of
his
former
life
had
written
that
song
to
show

any
further
observations
from
the
indignant
old

were
cut
short
by
the
announcement
of
the
song
which
anthony

gave
out
two
lines
at
a
time
for
the
information
of
such
of
his
hearers
as
were
unacquainted
with
the
legend
while
it
was
being
sung

on
its
conclusion

t
say
nothin
to
me
replied
sam
for
i
can
t
bear
it
he
s
close
to
the
door
i
hear
him
his
head
again
the
lath
and
plaster
as
sam
weller
spoke
the
little
door
flew
open
and
brother
tadger
appeared
closely
followed
by
the
reverend
stiggins
who
no
sooner
entered
than
there
was
a
great
clapping
of
hands
and
stamping
of
feet
and
flourishing
of
handkerchiefs
to
all
of
which
manifestations
of
delight
brother
stiggins
returned
no
other
acknowledgment
than
staring
with
a
wild
eye
and
a
fixed
smile
at
the
extreme
top
of
the
wick
of
the
candle
on
the
table
swaying
his
body
to
and
fro
meanwhile
in
a
very
unsteady
and
uncertain
manner
are
you
unwell
brother
stiggins
whispered
anthony
humm
i
am
all
right
sir
replied
stiggins
in
a
tone
in
which
ferocity
was
blended
with
an
extreme
thickness
of
utterance
i
am
all
right
oh
very
well
rejoined
anthony
humm
retreating
a
few
paces
i
believe
no
man
here
has
ventured
to
say
that
i
am
not
all
right
sir
said
stiggins
oh
certainly
not
said
humm
i
should
advise
him
not
to
sir
i
should
advise
him
not
said
stiggins
by
this
time
the
audience
were
perfectly
silent
and
waited
with
some
anxiety
for
the
resumption
of
business
will
you
address
the
meeting
brother
said
humm
with
a
smile
of
invitation
no
sir
rejoined
stiggins
no
sir
i
will
not
the
meeting
looked
at
each
other
with
raised
eyelids
and
a
murmur
of
astonishment
ran
through
the
room
it
s
my
opinion
sir
said
stiggins
unbuttoning
his
coat
and
speaking
very
loudly
it
s
my
opinion
sir
that
this
meeting
is
drunk
sir
brother
tadger
sir
said
stiggins
suddenly
increasing
in
ferocity
and
turning
sharp
round
on
the
little
man
in
the
drab
shorts
drunk
sir
with
this
stiggins
entertaining
a
praiseworthy
desire
to
promote
the
sobriety
of
the
meeting
and
to
exclude
therefrom
all
improper
characters
hit
brother
tadger
on
the
summit
of
the
nose
with
such
unerring
aim
that
the
drab
shorts
disappeared
like
a
flash
of
lightning
brother
tadger
had
been
knocked
head
first
down
the
ladder
upon
this
the
women
set
up
a
loud
and
dismal
screaming
and
rushing
in
small
parties
before
their
favourite
brothers
flung
their
arms
around
them
to
preserve
them
from
danger
an
instance
of
affection
which
had
nearly
proved
fatal
to
humm
who
being
extremely
popular
was
all
but
suffocated
by
the
crowd
of
female
devotees
that
hung
about
his
neck
and
heaped
caresses
upon
him
the
greater
part
of
the
lights
were
quickly
put
out
and
nothing
but
noise
and
confusion
resounded
on
all
sides
now
sammy
said
weller
taking
off
his
greatcoat
with
much
deliberation
just
you
step
out
and
fetch
in
a
and
wot
are
you
to
do
the
while
inquired
sam
never
you
mind
me
sammy
replied
the
old
gentleman
i
shall
ockipy
myself
in
havin
a
small
settlement
with
that
ere
before
sam
could
interfere
to
prevent
it
his
heroic
parent
had
penetrated
into
a
remote
corner
of
the
room
and
attacked
the
reverend
stiggins
with
manual
dexterity
come
off
said
sam
come
on
cried
weller
and
without
further
invitation
he
gave
the
reverend
stiggins
a
preliminary
tap
on
the
head
and
began
dancing
round
him
in
a
buoyant
and
manner
which
in
a
gentleman
at
his
time
of
life
was
a
perfect
marvel
to
behold
finding
all
remonstrances
unavailing
sam
pulled
his
hat
firmly
on
threw
his
father
s
coat
over
his
arm
and
taking
the
old
man
round
the
waist
forcibly
dragged
him
down
the
ladder
and
into
the
street
never
releasing
his
hold
or
permitting
him
to
stop
until
they
reached
the
corner
as
they
gained
it
they
could
hear
the
shouts
of
the
populace
who
were
witnessing
the
removal
of
the
reverend
stiggins
to
strong
lodgings
for
the
night
and
could
hear
the
noise
occasioned
by
the
dispersion
in
various
directions
of
the
members
of
the
brick
lane
branch
of
the
united
grand
junction
ebenezer
temperance
association
chapter
xxxiv
is
wholly
devoted
to
a
full
and
faithful
report
of
the
memorable
trial
of
bardell
against
pickwick
i
wonder
what
the
foreman
of
the
jury
whoever
he
ll
be
has
got
for
breakfast
said
snodgrass
by
way
of
keeping
up
a
conversation
on
the
eventful
morning
of
the
fourteenth
of
february
ah
said
perker
i
hope
he
s
got
a
good
why
so
inquired
pickwick
highly
important
very
important
my
dear
sir
replied
perker
a
good
contented
juryman
is
a
capital
thing
to
get
hold
of
discontented
or
hungry
jurymen
my
dear
sir
always
find
for
the
bless
my
heart
said
pickwick
looking
very
blank
what
do
they
do
that
for
why
i
don
t
know
replied
the
little
man
coolly
saves
time
i
suppose
if
it
s
near
the
foreman
takes
out
his
watch
when
the
jury
has
retired
and
says
dear
me
gentlemen
ten
minutes
to
five
i
declare
i
dine
at
five
so
do
i
says
everybody
else
except
two
men
who
ought
to
have
dined
at
three
and
seem
more
than
half
disposed
to
stand
out
in
consequence
the
foreman
smiles
and
puts
up
his
watch
well
gentlemen
what
do
we
say
plaintiff
or
defendant
gentlemen
i
rather
think
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
gentlemen
i
say
i
rather
think
but
don
t
let
that
influence
you
i
think
the
plaintiff
s
the
upon
this
two
or
three
other
men
are
sure
to
say
that
they
think
so
too
as
of
course
they
do
and
then
they
get
on
very
unanimously
and
comfortably
ten
minutes
past
nine
said
the
little
man
looking
at
his
watch
time
we
were
off
my
dear
sir
breach
of
promise
is
generally
full
in
such
cases
you
had
better
ring
for
a
coach
my
dear
sir
or
we
shall
be
rather
pickwick
immediately
rang
the
bell
and
a
coach
having
been
procured
the
four
pickwickians
and
perker
ensconced
themselves
therein
and
drove
to
guildhall
sam
weller
lowten
and
the
blue
bag
following
in
a
cab
lowten
said
perker
when
they
reached
the
outer
hall
of
the
court
put
pickwick
s
friends
in
the
students
box
pickwick
himself
had
better
sit
by
me
this
way
my
dear
sir
this
taking
pickwick
by
the
coat
sleeve
the
little
man
led
him
to
the
low
seat
just
beneath
the
desks
of
the
king
s
counsel
which
is
constructed
for
the
convenience
of
attorneys
who
from
that
spot
can
whisper
into
the
ear
of
the
leading
counsel
in
the
case
any
instructions
that
may
be
necessary
during
the
progress
of
the
trial
the
occupants
of
this
seat
are
invisible
to
the
great
body
of
spectators
inasmuch
as
they
sit
on
a
much
lower
level
than
either
the
barristers
or
the
audience
whose
seats
are
raised
above
the
floor
of
course
they
have
their
backs
to
both
and
their
faces
towards
the
judge
that
s
the
i
suppose
said
pickwick
pointing
to
a
kind
of
pulpit
with
a
brass
rail
on
his
left
hand
that
s
the
my
dear
sir
replied
perker
disinterring
a
quantity
of
papers
from
the
blue
bag
which
lowten
had
just
deposited
at
his
feet
and
that
said
pickwick
pointing
to
a
couple
of
enclosed
seats
on
his
right
that
s
where
the
jurymen
sit
is
it
not
the
identical
place
my
dear
sir
replied
perker
tapping
the
lid
of
his
pickwick
stood
up
in
a
state
of
great
agitation
and
took
a
glance
at
the
court
there
were
already
a
pretty
large
sprinkling
of
spectators
in
the
gallery
and
a
numerous
muster
of
gentlemen
in
wigs
in
the
barristers
seats
who
presented
as
a
body
all
that
pleasing
and
extensive
variety
of
nose
and
whisker
for
which
the
bar
of
england
is
so
justly
celebrated
such
of
the
gentlemen
as
had
a
brief
to
carry
carried
it
in
as
conspicuous
a
manner
as
possible
and
occasionally
scratched
their
noses
therewith
to
impress
the
fact
more
strongly
on
the
observation
of
the
spectators
other
gentlemen
who
had
no
briefs
to
show
carried
under
their
arms
goodly
octavos
with
a
red
label
behind
and
that
cover
which
is
technically
known
as
law
others
who
had
neither
briefs
nor
books
thrust
their
hands
into
their
pockets
and
looked
as
wise
as
they
conveniently
could
others
again
moved
here
and
there
with
great
restlessness
and
earnestness
of
manner
content
to
awaken
thereby
the
admiration
and
astonishment
of
the
uninitiated
strangers
the
whole
to
the
great
wonderment
of
pickwick
were
divided
into
little
groups
who
were
chatting
and
discussing
the
news
of
the
day
in
the
most
unfeeling
manner
possible
just
as
if
no
trial
at
all
were
coming
on
a
bow
from
phunky
as
he
entered
and
took
his
seat
behind
the
row
appropriated
to
the
king
s
counsel
attracted
pickwick
s
attention
and
he
had
scarcely
returned
it
when
serjeant
snubbin
appeared
followed
by
mallard
who
half
hid
the
serjeant
behind
a
large
crimson
bag
which
he
placed
on
his
table
and
after
shaking
hands
with
perker
withdrew
then
there
entered
two
or
three
more
serjeants
and
among
them
one
with
a
fat
body
and
a
red
face
who
nodded
in
a
friendly
manner
to
serjeant
snubbin
and
said
it
was
a
fine
morning
who
s
that
man
who
said
it
was
a
fine
morning
and
nodded
to
our
counsel
whispered
pickwick
mr
serjeant
buzfuz
replied
perker
he
s
opposed
to
us
he
leads
on
the
other
side
that
gentleman
behind
him
is
skimpin
his
pickwick
was
on
the
point
of
inquiring
with
great
abhorrence
of
the
man
s
villainy
how
serjeant
buzfuz
who
was
counsel
for
the
opposite
party
dared
to
presume
to
tell
serjeant
snubbin
who
was
counsel
for
him
that
it
was
a
fine
morning
when
he
was
interrupted
by
a
general
rising
of
the
barristers
and
a
loud
cry
of
silence
from
the
officers
of
the
court
looking
round
he
found
that
this
was
caused
by
the
entrance
of
the
judge
justice
stareleigh
who
sat
in
the
absence
of
the
chief
justice
occasioned
by
indisposition
was
a
most
particularly
short
man
and
so
fat
that
he
seemed
all
face
and
waistcoat
he
rolled
in
upon
two
little
turned
legs
and
having
bobbed
gravely
to
the
bar
who
bobbed
gravely
to
him
put
his
little
legs
underneath
his
table
and
his
little
hat
upon
it
and
when
justice
stareleigh
had
done
this
all
you
could
see
of
him
was
two
queer
little
eyes
one
broad
pink
face
and
somewhere
about
half
of
a
big
and
very
wig
the
judge
had
no
sooner
taken
his
seat
than
the
officer
on
the
floor
of
the
court
called
out
silence
in
a
commanding
tone
upon
which
another
officer
in
the
gallery
cried
silence
in
an
angry
manner
whereupon
three
or
four
more
ushers
shouted
silence
in
a
voice
of
indignant
remonstrance
this
being
done
a
gentleman
in
black
who
sat
below
the
judge
proceeded
to
call
over
the
names
of
the
jury
and
after
a
great
deal
of
bawling
it
was
discovered
that
only
ten
special
jurymen
were
present
upon
this
serjeant
buzfuz
prayed
a
the
gentleman
in
black
then
proceeded
to
press
into
the
special
jury
two
of
the
common
jurymen
and
a
greengrocer
and
a
chemist
were
caught
directly
answer
to
your
names
gentlemen
that
you
may
be
sworn
said
the
gentleman
in
black
richard
here
said
the
greengrocer
thomas
here
said
the
chemist
take
the
book
gentlemen
you
shall
well
and
truly
try
i
beg
this
court
s
pardon
said
the
chemist
who
was
a
tall
thin
man
but
i
hope
this
court
will
excuse
my
on
what
grounds
sir
said
justice
stareleigh
i
have
no
assistant
my
lord
said
the
chemist
i
can
t
help
that
sir
replied
justice
stareleigh
you
should
hire
i
can
t
afford
it
my
lord
rejoined
the
chemist
then
you
ought
to
be
able
to
afford
it
sir
said
the
judge
reddening
for
justice
stareleigh
s
temper
bordered
on
the
irritable
and
brooked
not
contradiction
i
know
i
do
if
i
got
on
as
well
as
i
deserved
but
i
don
t
my
lord
answered
the
chemist
swear
the
gentleman
said
the
judge
peremptorily
the
officer
had
got
no
further
than
the
you
shall
well
and
truly
try
when
he
was
again
interrupted
by
the
chemist
i
am
to
be
sworn
my
lord
am
i
said
the
chemist
certainly
sir
replied
the
testy
little
judge
very
well
my
lord
replied
the
chemist
in
a
resigned
manner
then
there
ll
be
murder
before
this
trial
s
over
that
s
all
swear
me
if
you
please
sir
and
sworn
the
chemist
was
before
the
judge
could
find
words
to
utter
i
merely
wanted
to
observe
my
lord
said
the
chemist
taking
his
seat
with
great
deliberation
that
i
ve
left
nobody
but
an
in
my
shop
he
is
a
very
nice
boy
my
lord
but
he
is
not
acquainted
with
drugs
and
i
know
that
the
prevailing
impression
on
his
mind
is
that
epsom
salts
means
oxalic
acid
and
syrup
of
senna
laudanum
that
s
all
my
with
this
the
tall
chemist
composed
himself
into
a
comfortable
attitude
and
assuming
a
pleasant
expression
of
countenance
appeared
to
have
prepared
himself
for
the
worst
pickwick
was
regarding
the
chemist
with
feelings
of
the
deepest
horror
when
a
slight
sensation
was
perceptible
in
the
body
of
the
court
and
immediately
afterwards
bardell
supported
by
cluppins
was
led
in
and
placed
in
a
drooping
state
at
the
other
end
of
the
seat
on
which
pickwick
sat
an
umbrella
was
then
handed
in
by
dodson
and
a
pair
of
pattens
by
fogg
each
of
whom
had
prepared
a
most
sympathising
and
melancholy
face
for
the
occasion
sanders
then
appeared
leading
in
master
bardell
at
sight
of
her
child
bardell
started
suddenly
recollecting
herself
she
kissed
him
in
a
frantic
manner
then
relapsing
into
a
state
of
hysterical
imbecility
the
good
lady
requested
to
be
informed
where
she
was
in
reply
to
this
cluppins
and
sanders
turned
their
heads
away
and
wept
while
dodson
and
fogg
entreated
the
plaintiff
to
compose
herself
serjeant
buzfuz
rubbed
his
eyes
very
hard
with
a
large
white
handkerchief
and
gave
an
appealing
look
towards
the
jury
while
the
judge
was
visibly
affected
and
several
of
the
beholders
tried
to
cough
down
their
emotion
very
good
notion
that
indeed
whispered
perker
to
pickwick
capital
fellows
those
dodson
and
fogg
excellent
ideas
of
effect
my
dear
sir
as
perker
spoke
bardell
began
to
recover
by
slow
degrees
while
cluppins
after
a
careful
survey
of
master
bardell
s
buttons
and
the
to
which
they
severally
belonged
placed
him
on
the
floor
of
the
court
in
front
of
his
mother
a
commanding
position
in
which
he
could
not
fail
to
awaken
the
full
commiseration
and
sympathy
of
both
judge
and
jury
this
was
not
done
without
considerable
opposition
and
many
tears
on
the
part
of
the
young
gentleman
himself
who
had
certain
inward
misgivings
that
the
placing
him
within
the
full
glare
of
the
judge
s
eye
was
only
a
formal
prelude
to
his
being
immediately
ordered
away
for
instant
execution
or
for
transportation
beyond
the
seas
during
the
whole
term
of
his
natural
life
at
the
very
least
bardell
and
pickwick
cried
the
gentleman
in
black
calling
on
the
case
which

first
on
the
list

the
plaintiff
my
lord

serjeant
buzfuz

the
judge
writing
down
the
names
in
his
and
reading
as
he
wrote
for
the
defendant
serjeant
snubbin
and
beg
your
lordship

good
said
the
judge
i
never
had
the
pleasure
of
hearing
the
gentleman
s
name
here
phunky
bowed
and
smiled
and
the
judge
bowed
and
smiled
too
and
then
phunky
blushing
into
the
very
whites
of
his
eyes
tried
to
look
as
if
he
didn
t
know
that
everybody
was
gazing
at
him
a
thing
which
no
man
ever
succeeded
in
doing
yet
or
in
all
reasonable
probability
ever
will
go
on
said
the
judge
the
ushers
again
called
silence
and
skimpin
proceeded
to
open
the
case
and
the
case
appeared
to
have
very
little
inside
it
when
he
had
opened
it
for
he
kept
such
particulars
as
he
knew
completely
to
himself
and
sat
down
after
a
lapse
of
three
minutes
leaving
the
jury
in
precisely
the
same
advanced
stage
of
wisdom
as
they
were
in
before
serjeant
buzfuz
then
rose
with
all
the
majesty
and
dignity
which
the
grave
nature
of
the
proceedings
demanded
and
having
whispered
to
dodson
and
conferred
briefly
with
fogg
pulled
his
gown
over
his
shoulders
settled
his
wig
and
addressed
the
jury
serjeant
buzfuz
began
by
saying
that
never
in
the
whole
course
of
his
professional
experience
never
from
the
very
first
moment
of
his
applying
himself
to
the
study
and
practice
of
the
law
had
he
approached
a
case
with
feelings
of
such
deep
emotion
or
with
such
a
heavy
sense
of
the
responsibility
imposed
upon
him
a
responsibility
he
would
say
which
he
could
never
have
supported
were
he
not
buoyed
up
and
sustained
by
a
conviction
so
strong
that
it
amounted
to
positive
certainty
that
the
cause
of
truth
and
justice
or
in
other
words
the
cause
of
his
and
most
oppressed
client
must
prevail
with
the
minded
and
intelligent
dozen
of
men
whom
he
now
saw
in
that
box
before
him
counsel
usually
begin
in
this
way
because
it
puts
the
jury
on
the
very
best
terms
with
themselves
and
makes
them
think
what
sharp
fellows
they
must
be
a
visible
effect
was
produced
immediately
several
jurymen
beginning
to
take
voluminous
notes
with
the
utmost
eagerness
you
have
heard
from
my
learned
friend
gentlemen
continued
serjeant
buzfuz
well
knowing
that
from
the
learned
friend
alluded
to
the
gentlemen
of
the
jury
had
heard
just
nothing
at
all
you
have
heard
from
my
learned
friend
gentlemen
that
this
is
an
action
for
a
breach
of
promise
of
marriage
in
which
the
damages
are
laid
at
but
you
have
not
heard
from
my
learned
friend
inasmuch
as
it
did
not
come
within
my
learned
friend
s
province
to
tell
you
what
are
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
case
those
facts
and
circumstances
gentlemen
you
shall
hear
detailed
by
me
and
proved
by
the
unimpeachable
female
whom
i
will
place
in
that
box
before
here
serjeant
buzfuz
with
a
tremendous
emphasis
on
the
word
box
smote
his
table
with
a
mighty
sound
and
glanced
at
dodson
and
fogg
who
nodded
admiration
of
the
serjeant
and
indignant
defiance
of
the
defendant
the
plaintiff
gentlemen
continued
serjeant
buzfuz
in
a
soft
and
melancholy
voice
the
plaintiff
is
a
widow
yes
gentlemen
a
widow
the
late
bardell
after
enjoying
for
many
years
the
esteem
and
confidence
of
his
sovereign
as
one
of
the
guardians
of
his
royal
revenues
glided
almost
imperceptibly
from
the
world
to
seek
elsewhere
for
that
repose
and
peace
which
a
can
never
at
this
pathetic
description
of
the
decease
of
bardell
who
had
been
knocked
on
the
head
with
a
in
a
cellar
the
learned
serjeant
s
voice
faltered
and
he
proceeded
with
emotion
some
time
before
his
death
he
had
stamped
his
likeness
upon
a
little
boy
with
this
little
boy
the
only
pledge
of
her
departed
exciseman
bardell
shrank
from
the
world
and
courted
the
retirement
and
tranquillity
of
goswell
street
and
here
she
placed
in
her
front
parlour
window
a
written
placard
bearing
this
inscription
apartments
furnished
for
a
single
gentleman
inquire
here
serjeant
buzfuz
paused
while
several
gentlemen
of
the
jury
took
a
note
of
the
document
there
is
no
date
to
that
is
there
inquired
a
juror
there
is
no
date
gentlemen
replied
serjeant
buzfuz
but
i
am
instructed
to
say
that
it
was
put
in
the
plaintiff
s
parlour
window
just
this
time
three
years
i
entreat
the
attention
of
the
jury
to
the
wording
of
this
document
apartments
furnished
for
a
single
gentleman
bardell
s
opinions
of
the
opposite
sex
gentlemen
were
derived
from
a
long
contemplation
of
the
inestimable
qualities
of
her
lost
husband
she
had
no
fear
she
had
no
distrust
she
had
no
suspicion
all
was
confidence
and
reliance
mr
bardell
said
the
widow
mr
bardell
was
a
man
of
honour
bardell
was
a
man
of
his
word
bardell
was
no
deceiver
bardell
was
once
a
single
gentleman
himself
to
single
gentlemen
i
look
for
protection
for
assistance
for
comfort
and
for
consolation
in
single
gentlemen
i
shall
perpetually
see
something
to
remind
me
of
what
bardell
was
when
he
first
won
my
young
and
untried
affections
to
a
single
gentleman
then
shall
my
lodgings
be
actuated
by
this
beautiful
and
touching
impulse
among
the
best
impulses
of
our
imperfect
nature
gentlemen
the
lonely
and
desolate
widow
dried
her
tears
furnished
her
first
floor
caught
her
innocent
boy
to
her
maternal
bosom
and
put
the
bill
up
in
her
parlour
window
did
it
remain
there
long
no
the
serpent
was
on
the
watch
the
train
was
laid
the
mine
was
preparing
the
sapper
and
miner
was
at
work
before
the
bill
had
been
in
the
parlour
window
three
days
three
days
gentlemen
a
being
erect
upon
two
legs
and
bearing
all
the
outward
semblance
of
a
man
and
not
of
a
monster
knocked
at
the
door
of
bardell
s
house
he
inquired
within
he
took
the
lodgings
and
on
the
very
next
day
he
entered
into
possession
of
them
this
man
was
pickwick
pickwick
the
serjeant
buzfuz
who
had
proceeded
with
such
volubility
that
his
face
was
perfectly
crimson
here
paused
for
breath
the
silence
awoke
justice
stareleigh
who
immediately
wrote
down
something
with
a
pen
without
any
ink
in
it
and
looked
unusually
profound
to
impress
the
jury
with
the
belief
that
he
always
thought
most
deeply
with
his
eyes
shut
serjeant
buzfuz
proceeded
of
this
man
pickwick
i
will
say
little
the
subject
presents
but
few
attractions
and
i
gentlemen
am
not
the
man
nor
are
you
gentlemen
the
men
to
delight
in
the
contemplation
of
revolting
heartlessness
and
of
systematic
here
pickwick
who
had
been
writhing
in
silence
for
some
time
gave
a
violent
start
as
if
some
vague
idea
of
assaulting
serjeant
buzfuz
in
the
august
presence
of
justice
and
law
suggested
itself
to
his
mind
an
admonitory
gesture
from
perker
restrained
him
and
he
listened
to
the
learned
gentleman
s
continuation
with
a
look
of
indignation
which
contrasted
forcibly
with
the
admiring
faces
of
cluppins
and
sanders
i
say
systematic
villainy
gentlemen
said
serjeant
buzfuz
looking
through
pickwick
and
talking
him
and
when
i
say
systematic
villainy
let
me
tell
the
defendant
pickwick
if
he
be
in
court
as
i
am
informed
he
is
that
it
would
have
been
more
decent
in
him
more
becoming
in
better
judgment
and
in
better
taste
if
he
had
stopped
away
let
me
tell
him
gentlemen
that
any
gestures
of
dissent
or
disapprobation
in
which
he
may
indulge
in
this
court
will
not
go
down
with
you
that
you
will
know
how
to
value
and
how
to
appreciate
them
and
let
me
tell
him
further
as
my
lord
will
tell
you
gentlemen
that
a
counsel
in
the
discharge
of
his
duty
to
his
client
is
neither
to
be
intimidated
nor
bullied
nor
put
down
and
that
any
attempt
to
do
either
the
one
or
the
other
or
the
first
or
the
last
will
recoil
on
the
head
of
the
attempter
be
he
plaintiff
or
be
he
defendant
be
his
name
pickwick
or
noakes
or
stoakes
or
stiles
or
brown
or
this
little
divergence
from
the
subject
in
hand
had
of
course
the
intended
effect
of
turning
all
eyes
to
pickwick
serjeant
buzfuz
having
partially
recovered
from
the
state
of
moral
elevation
into
which
he
had
lashed
himself
resumed
i
shall
show
you
gentlemen
that
for
two
years
pickwick
continued
to
reside
constantly
and
without
interruption
or
intermission
at
bardell
s
house
i
shall
show
you
that
bardell
during
the
whole
of
that
time
waited
on
him
attended
to
his
comforts
cooked
his
meals
looked
out
his
linen
for
the
washerwoman
when
it
went
abroad
darned
aired
and
prepared
it
for
wear
when
it
came
home
and
in
short
enjoyed
his
fullest
trust
and
confidence
i
shall
show
you
that
on
many
occasions
he
gave
halfpence
and
on
some
occasions
even
sixpences
to
her
little
boy
and
i
shall
prove
to
you
by
a
witness
whose
testimony
it
will
be
impossible
for
my
learned
friend
to
weaken
or
controvert
that
on
one
occasion
he
patted
the
boy
on
the
head
and
after
inquiring
whether
he
had
won
any
or
lately
both
of
which
i
understand
to
be
a
particular
species
of
marbles
much
prized
by
the
youth
of
this
town
made
use
of
this
remarkable
expression
how
should
you
like
to
have
another
father
i
shall
prove
to
you
gentlemen
that
about
a
year
ago
pickwick
suddenly
began
to
absent
himself
from
home
during
long
intervals
as
if
with
the
intention
of
gradually
breaking
off
from
my
client
but
i
shall
show
you
also
that
his
resolution
was
not
at
that
time
sufficiently
strong
or
that
his
better
feelings
conquered
if
better
feelings
he
has
or
that
the
charms
and
accomplishments
of
my
client
prevailed
against
his
unmanly
intentions
by
proving
to
you
that
on
one
occasion
when
he
returned
from
the
country
he
distinctly
and
in
terms
offered
her
marriage
previously
however
taking
special
care
that
there
would
be
no
witness
to
their
solemn
contract
and
i
am
in
a
situation
to
prove
to
you
on
the
testimony
of
three
of
his
own
friends
most
unwilling
witnesses
gentlemen
most
unwilling
witnesses
that
on
that
morning
he
was
discovered
by
them
holding
the
plaintiff
in
his
arms
and
soothing
her
agitation
by
his
caresses
and
a
visible
impression
was
produced
upon
the
auditors
by
this
part
of
the
learned
serjeant
s
address
drawing
forth
two
very
small
scraps
of
paper
he
proceeded
and
now
gentlemen
but
one
word
more
two
letters
have
passed
between
these
parties
letters
which
are
admitted
to
be
in
the
handwriting
of
the
defendant
and
which
speak
volumes
indeed
the
letters
too
bespeak
the
character
of
the
man
they
are
not
open
fervent
eloquent
epistles
breathing
nothing
but
the
language
of
affectionate
attachment
they
are
covert
sly
underhanded
communications
but
fortunately
far
more
conclusive
than
if
couched
in
the
most
glowing
language
and
the
most
poetic
imagery
letters
that
must
be
viewed
with
a
cautious
and
suspicious
eye
letters
that
were
evidently
intended
at
the
time
by
pickwick
to
mislead
and
delude
any
third
parties
into
whose
hands
they
might
fall
let
me
read
the
first
garraways
twelve
o
clock
dear
mrs
chops
and
tomato
sauce
yours
gentlemen
what
does
this
mean
chops
and
tomato
sauce
yours
pickwick
chops
gracious
heavens
and
tomato
sauce
gentlemen
is
the
happiness
of
a
sensitive
and
confiding
female
to
be
trifled
away
by
such
shallow
artifices
as
these
the
next
has
no
date
whatever
which
is
in
itself
suspicious
dear
i
shall
not
be
at
home
till
slow
and
then
follows
this
very
remarkable
expression
don
t
trouble
yourself
about
the
the
why
gentlemen
who
himself
about
a
when
was
the
peace
of
mind
of
man
or
woman
broken
or
disturbed
by
a
which
is
in
itself
a
harmless
a
useful
and
i
will
add
gentlemen
a
comforting
article
of
domestic
furniture
why
is
bardell
so
earnestly
entreated
not
to
agitate
herself
about
this
unless
as
is
no
doubt
the
case
it
is
a
mere
cover
for
hidden
fire
a
mere
substitute
for
some
endearing
word
or
promise
agreeably
to
a
preconcerted
system
of
correspondence
artfully
contrived
by
pickwick
with
a
view
to
his
contemplated
desertion
and
which
i
am
not
in
a
condition
to
explain
and
what
does
this
allusion
to
the
slow
coach
mean
for
aught
i
know
it
may
be
a
reference
to
pickwick
himself
who
has
most
unquestionably
been
a
criminally
slow
coach
during
the
whole
of
this
transaction
but
whose
speed
will
now
be
very
unexpectedly
accelerated
and
whose
wheels
gentlemen
as
he
will
find
to
his
cost
will
very
soon
be
greased
by
you
serjeant
buzfuz
paused
in
this
place
to
see
whether
the
jury
smiled
at
his
joke
but
as
nobody
took
it
but
the
greengrocer
whose
sensitiveness
on
the
subject
was
very
probably
occasioned
by
his
having
subjected
a
to
the
process
in
question
on
that
identical
morning
the
learned
serjeant
considered
it
advisable
to
undergo
a
slight
relapse
into
the
dismals
before
he
concluded
but
enough
of
this
gentlemen
said
serjeant
buzfuz
it
is
difficult
to
smile
with
an
aching
heart
it
is
ill
jesting
when
our
deepest
sympathies
are
awakened
my
client
s
hopes
and
prospects
are
ruined
and
it
is
no
figure
of
speech
to
say
that
her
occupation
is
gone
indeed
the
bill
is
down
but
there
is
no
tenant
eligible
single
gentlemen
pass
and
repass
but
there
is
no
invitation
for
to
inquire
within
or
without
all
is
gloom
and
silence
in
the
house
even
the
voice
of
the
child
is
hushed
his
infant
sports
are
disregarded
when
his
mother
weeps
his
alley
tors
and
his
commoneys
are
alike
neglected
he
forgets
the
long
familiar
cry
of
knuckle
down
and
at
or
odd
and
even
his
hand
is
out
but
pickwick
gentlemen
pickwick
the
ruthless
destroyer
of
this
domestic
oasis
in
the
desert
of
goswell
street
pickwick
who
has
choked
up
the
well
and
thrown
ashes
on
the
sward
pickwick
who
comes
before
you
with
his
heartless
tomato
sauce
and
pickwick
still
rears
his
head
with
unblushing
effrontery
and
gazes
without
a
sigh
on
the
ruin
he
has
made
damages
gentlemen
heavy
damages
is
the
only
punishment
with
which
you
can
visit
him
the
only
recompense
you
can
award
to
my
client
and
for
those
damages
she
now
appeals
to
an
enlightened
a
a
feeling
a
conscientious
a
dispassionate
a
sympathising
a
contemplative

of
her
civilised
with
this
beautiful
peroration
serjeant
buzfuz
sat
down
and
justice
stareleigh
woke
up

said
serjeant
buzfuz
rising
a
minute
afterwards
with
renewed
vigour
the
nearest
usher
called
for
elizabeth
tuppins
another
one
at
a
little
distance
off
demanded
elizabeth
jupkins
and
a
third
rushed
in
a
breathless
state
into
king
street
and
screamed
for
elizabeth
muffins
till
he
was
hoarse
meanwhile
cluppins
with
the
combined
assistance
of
bardell
sanders
dodson
and
fogg
was
hoisted
into
the
box
and
when
she
was
safely
perched
on

bardell
stood
on
the
bottom

with

whose
eyes
were
intently
fixed
on
the
judge
s
face
planted
herself
close
by
with
the
large
umbrella
keeping
her
right
thumb
pressed
on
the
spring
with
an
earnest
countenance
as
if
she
were
fully
prepared

of

was
desired
to
compose
herself
she
sobbed
with
increased
vehemence
and
gave
divers
alarming
manifestations
of
an
approaching
fainting
fit
or
as
she
afterwards
said
of
her

too
many

replied
cluppins
what
were

in
the
back
room

inquired
the
little
judge
my
lord
and
jury
said
cluppins
with
interesting
agitation
i
will
not
deceive
you
had
better
not
ma

said
the
little
judge
i
was
there
resumed
cluppins
unbeknown
to
bardell
i
had
been
out
with
a
little
basket
gentlemen
to
buy
three
pound
of
red
kidney
pertaties
which
was
three
pound

when
i

exclaimed
the
little
judge
partly
open
my
lord
said
serjeant
snubbin
she
said
on
the
jar
said
the
little
judge
with
a
cunning
look
it
s
all
the
same
my
lord
said
serjeant
snubbin
the
little
judge
looked
doubtful
and
said
he
d
make
a
note
of
it
cluppins
then
resumed
i
walked
in
gentlemen
just
to
say
and
went
in
a
permiscuous
manner
upstairs
and
into
the
back
room
gentlemen
there
was
the
sound
of
voices
in
the
front
room
and
and
you
listened
i
believe
cluppins
said
serjeant
buzfuz
beggin
your
pardon
sir
replied
cluppins
in
a
majestic
manner
i
would
scorn
the
haction
the
voices
was
very
loud
sir
and
forced
themselves
upon
my
well
cluppins
you
were
not
listening
but
you
heard
the
voices
was
one
of
those
voices
pickwick
s
yes
it
were
and
cluppins
after
distinctly
stating
that
pickwick
addressed
himself
to
bardell
repeated
by
slow
degrees
and
by
dint
of
many
questions
the
conversation
with
which
our
readers
are
already
acquainted
the
jury
looked
suspicious
and
serjeant
buzfuz
smiled
as
he
sat
down
they
looked
positively
awful
when
serjeant
snubbin
intimated
that
he
should
not
the
witness
for
pickwick
wished
it
to
be
distinctly
stated
that
it
was
due
to
her
to
say
that
her
account
was
in
substance
correct
cluppins
having
once
broken
the
ice
thought
it
a
favourable
opportunity
for
entering
into
a
short
dissertation
on
her
own
domestic
affairs
so
she
straightway
proceeded
to
inform
the
court
that
she
was
the
mother
of
eight
children
at
that
present
speaking
and
that
she
entertained
confident
expectations
of
presenting
cluppins
with
a
ninth
somewhere
about
that
day
six
months
at
this
interesting
point
the
little
judge
interposed
most
irascibly
and
the
effect
of
the
interposition
was
that
both
the
worthy
lady
and
sanders
were
politely
taken
out
of
court
under
the
escort
of
jackson
without
further
parley
nathaniel
winkle
said
skimpin
here
replied
a
feeble
voice
winkle
entered
the
and
having
been
duly
sworn
bowed
to
the
judge
with
considerable
deference
don
t
look
at
me
sir
said
the
judge
sharply
in
acknowledgment
of
the
salute
look
at
the
winkle
obeyed
the
mandate
and
looked
at
the
place
where
he
thought
it
most
probable
the
jury
might
be
for
seeing
anything
in
his
then
state
of
intellectual
complication
was
wholly
out
of
the
question
winkle
was
then
examined
by
skimpin
who
being
a
promising
young
man
of
two
or
was
of
course
anxious
to
confuse
a
witness
who
was
notoriously
predisposed
in
favour
of
the
other
side
as
much
as
he
could
now
sir
said
skimpin
have
the
goodness
to
let
his
lordship
know
what
your
name
is
will
you
and
skimpin
inclined
his
head
on
one
side
to
listen
with
great
sharpness
to
the
answer
and
glanced
at
the
jury
meanwhile
as
if
to
imply
that
he
rather
expected
winkle
s
natural
taste
for
perjury
would
induce
him
to
give
some
name
which
did
not
belong
to
him
winkle
replied
the
witness
what
s
your
christian
name
sir
angrily
inquired
the
little
judge
nathaniel
daniel
any
other
name
nathaniel
sir
my
lord
i
nathaniel
daniel
or
daniel
nathaniel
no
my
lord
only
nathaniel
not
daniel
at
what
did
you
tell
me
it
was
daniel
for
then
sir
inquired
the
judge
i
didn
t
my
lord
replied
winkle
you
did
sir
replied
the
judge
with
a
severe
frown
how
could
i
have
got
daniel
on
my
notes
unless
you
told
me
so
sir
this
argument
was
of
course
unanswerable
mr
winkle
has
rather
a
short
memory
my
lord
interposed
skimpin
with
another
glance
at
the
jury
we
shall
find
means
to
refresh
it
before
we
have
quite
done
with
him
i
dare
you
had
better
be
careful
sir
said
the
little
judge
with
a
sinister
look
at
the
witness
poor
winkle
bowed
and
endeavoured
to
feign
an
easiness
of
manner
which
in
his
then
state
of
confusion
gave
him
rather
the
air
of
a
disconcerted
pickpocket
now
winkle
said
skimpin
attend
to
me
if
you
please
sir
and
let
me
recommend
you
for
your
own
sake
to
bear
in
mind
his
lordship
s
injunctions
to
be
careful
i
believe
you
are
a
particular
friend
of
pickwick
the
defendant
are
you
not
i
have
known
pickwick
now
as
well
as
i
recollect
at
this
moment
nearly
pray
winkle
do
not
evade
the
question
are
you
or
are
you
not
a
particular
friend
of
the
defendant
s
i
was
just
about
to
say
that
will
you
or
will
you
not
answer
my
question
sir
if
you
don
t
answer
the
question
you
ll
be
committed
sir
interposed
the
little
judge
looking
over
his
come
sir
said
skimpin
yes
or
no
if
you
yes
i
am
replied
winkle
yes
you
are
and
why
couldn
t
you
say
that
at
once
sir
perhaps
you
know
the
plaintiff
too
eh
winkle
i
don
t
know
her
i
ve
seen
oh
you
don
t
know
her
but
you
ve
seen
her
now
have
the
goodness
to
tell
the
gentlemen
of
the
jury
what
you
mean
by
that
i
mean
that
i
am
not
intimate
with
her
but
i
have
seen
her
when
i
went
to
call
on
pickwick
in
goswell
how
often
have
you
seen
her
sir
how
often
yes
winkle
how
often
i
ll
repeat
the
question
for
you
a
dozen
times
if
you
require
it
and
the
learned
gentleman
with
a
firm
and
steady
frown
placed
his
hands
on
his
hips
and
smiled
suspiciously
to
the
jury
on
this
question
there
arose
the
edifying
customary
on
such
points
first
of
all
winkle
said
it
was
quite
impossible
for
him
to
say
how
many
times
he
had
seen
bardell
then
he
was
asked
if
he
had
seen
her
twenty
times
to
which
he
replied
certainly
more
than
then
he
was
asked
whether
he
hadn
t
seen
her
a
hundred
times
whether
he
couldn
t
swear
that
he
had
seen
her
more
than
fifty
times
whether
he
didn
t
know
that
he
had
seen
her
at
least
times
and
so
forth
the
satisfactory
conclusion
which
was
arrived
at
at
last
being
that
he
had
better
take
care
of
himself
and
mind
what
he
was
about
the
witness
having
been
by
these
means
reduced
to
the
requisite
ebb
of
nervous
perplexity
the
examination
was
continued
as
follows
pray
winkle
do
you
remember
calling
on
the
defendant
pickwick
at
these
apartments
in
the
plaintiff
s
house
in
goswell
street
on
one
particular
morning
in
the
month
of
july
last
yes
i
were
you
accompanied
on
that
occasion
by
a
friend
of
the
name
of
tupman
and
another
by
the
name
of
snodgrass
yes
i
are
they
here
yes
they
are
replied
winkle
looking
very
earnestly
towards
the
spot
where
his
friends
were
stationed
pray
attend
to
me
winkle
and
never
mind
your
friends
said
skimpin
with
another
expressive
look
at
the
jury
they
must
tell
their
stories
without
any
previous
consultation
with
you
if
none
has
yet
taken
place
another
look
at
the
jury
now
sir
tell
the
gentlemen
of
the
jury
what
you
saw
on
entering
the
defendant
s
room
on
this
particular
morning
come
out
with
it
sir
we
must
have
it
sooner
or
the
defendant
pickwick
was
holding
the
plaintiff
in
his
arms
with
his
hands
clasping
her
waist
replied
winkle
with
natural
hesitation
and
the
plaintiff
appeared
to
have
fainted
did
you
hear
the
defendant
say
anything
i
heard
him
call
bardell
a
good
creature
and
i
heard
him
ask
her
to
compose
herself
for
what
a
situation
it
was
if
anybody
should
come
or
words
to
that
now
winkle
i
have
only
one
more
question
to
ask
you
and
i
beg
you
to
bear
in
mind
his
lordship
s
caution
will
you
undertake
to
swear
that
pickwick
the
defendant
did
not
say
on
the
occasion
in
question
my
dear
bardell
you
re
a
good
creature
compose
yourself
to
this
situation
for
to
this
situation
you
must
come
or
words
to
that
effect
i
i
didn
t
understand
him
so
certainly
said
winkle
astounded
on
this
ingenious
of
the
few
words
he
had
heard
i
was
on
the
staircase
and
couldn
t
hear
distinctly
the
impression
on
my
mind
is
the
gentlemen
of
the
jury
want
none
of
the
impressions
on
your
mind
winkle
which
i
fear
would
be
of
little
service
to
honest
straightforward
men
interposed
skimpin
you
were
on
the
staircase
and
didn
t
distinctly
hear
but
you
will
not
swear
that
pickwick
did
not
make
use
of
the
expressions
i
have
quoted
do
i
understand
that
no
i
will
not
replied
winkle
and
down
sat
skimpin
with
a
triumphant
countenance
pickwick
s
case
had
not
gone
off
in
so
particularly
happy
a
manner
up
to
this
point
that
it
could
very
well
afford
to
have
any
additional
suspicion
cast
upon
it
but
as
it
could
afford
to
be
placed
in
a
rather
better
light
if
possible
phunky
rose
for
the
purpose
of
getting
something
important
out
of
winkle
in
whether
he
did
get
anything
important
out
of
him
will
immediately
appear
i
believe
winkle
said
phunky
that
pickwick
is
not
a
young
man
oh
no
replied
winkle
old
enough
to
be
my
you
have
told
my
learned
friend
that
you
have
known
pickwick
a
long
time
had
you
ever
any
reason
to
suppose
or
believe
that
he
was
about
to
be
married
oh
no
certainly
not
replied
winkle
with
so
much
eagerness
that
phunky
ought
to
have
got
him
out
of
the
box
with
all
possible
dispatch
lawyers
hold
that
there
are
two
kinds
of
particularly
bad
witnesses
a
reluctant
witness
and
a
witness
it
was
winkle
s
fate
to
figure
in
both
characters
i
will
even
go
further
than
this
winkle
continued
phunky
in
a
most
smooth
and
complacent
manner
did
you
ever
see
anything
in
pickwick
s
manner
and
conduct
towards
the
opposite
sex
to
induce
you
to
believe
that
he
ever
contemplated
matrimony
of
late
years
in
any
case
oh
no
certainly
not
replied
winkle
has
his
behaviour
when
females
have
been
in
the
case
always
been
that
of
a
man
who
having
attained
a
pretty
advanced
period
of
life
content
with
his
own
occupations
and
amusements
treats
them
only
as
a
father
might
his
daughters
not
the
least
doubt
of
it
replied
winkle
in
the
fulness
of
his
heart
that
is
yes
oh
yes
you
have
never
known
anything
in
his
behaviour
towards
bardell
or
any
other
female
in
the
least
degree
suspicious
said
phunky
preparing
to
sit
down
for
serjeant
snubbin
was
winking
at
him
replied
winkle
except
on
one
trifling
occasion
which
i
have
no
doubt
might
be
easily
now
if
the
unfortunate
phunky
had
sat
down
when
serjeant
snubbin
had
winked
at
him
or
if
serjeant
buzfuz
had
stopped
this
irregular
at
the
outset
which
he
knew
better
than
to
do
observing
winkle
s
anxiety
and
well
knowing
it
would
in
all
probability
lead
to
something
serviceable
to
him
this
unfortunate
admission
would
not
have
been
elicited
the
moment
the
words
fell
from
winkle
s
lips
phunky
sat
down
and
serjeant
snubbin
rather
hastily
told
him
he
might
leave
the
box
which
winkle
prepared
to
do
with
great
readiness
when
serjeant
buzfuz
stopped
him
stay
winkle
stay
said
serjeant
buzfuz
will
your
lordship
have
the
goodness
to
ask
him
what
this
one
instance
of
suspicious
behaviour
towards
females
on
the
part
of
this
gentleman
who
is
old
enough
to
be
his
father
was
you
hear
what
the
learned
counsel
says
sir
observed
the
judge
turning
to
the
miserable
and
agonised
winkle
describe
the
occasion
to
which
you
my
lord
said
winkle
trembling
with
anxiety
i
i
d
rather
perhaps
so
said
the
little
judge
but
you
amid
the
profound
silence
of
the
whole
court
winkle
faltered
out
that
the
trifling
circumstance
of
suspicion
was
pickwick
s
being
found
in
a
lady
s
at
midnight
which
had
terminated
he
believed
in
the
breaking
off
of
the
projected
marriage
of
the
lady
in
question
and
had
led
he
knew
to
the
whole
party
being
forcibly
carried
before
george
nupkins
magistrate
and
justice
of
the
peace
for
the
borough
of
ipswich
you
may
leave
the
box
sir
said
serjeant
snubbin
winkle
did
leave
the
box
and
rushed
with
delirious
haste
to
the
george
and
vulture
where
he
was
discovered
some
hours
after
by
the
waiter
groaning
in
a
hollow
and
dismal
manner
with
his
head
buried
beneath
the
sofa
cushions
tracy
tupman
and
augustus
snodgrass
were
severally
called
into
the
box
both
corroborated
the
testimony
of
their
unhappy
friend
and
each
was
driven
to
the
verge
of
desperation
by
excessive
badgering
susannah
sanders
was
then
called
and
examined
by
serjeant
buzfuz
and
by
serjeant
snubbin
had
always
said
and
believed
that
pickwick
would
marry
bardell
knew
that
bardell
s
being
engaged
to
pickwick
was
the
current
topic
of
conversation
in
the
neighbourhood
after
the
fainting
in
july
had
been
told
it
herself
by
mudberry
which
kept
a
mangle
and
bunkin
which
but
did
not
see
either
mudberry
or
bunkin
in
court
had
heard
pickwick
ask
the
little
boy
how
he
should
like
to
have
another
father
did
not
know
that
bardell
was
at
that
time
keeping
company
with
the
baker
but
did
know
that
the
baker
was
then
a
single
man
and
is
now
married
couldn
t
swear
that
bardell
was
not
very
fond
of
the
baker
but
should
think
that
the
baker
was
not
very
fond
of
bardell
or
he
wouldn
t
have
married
somebody
else
thought
bardell
fainted
away
on
the
morning
in
july
because
pickwick
asked
her
to
name
the
day
knew
that
she
witness
fainted
away
stone
dead
when
sanders
asked
her
to
name
the
day
and
believed
that
everybody
as
called
herself
a
lady
would
do
the
same
under
similar
circumstances
heard
pickwick
ask
the
boy
the
question
about
the
marbles
but
upon
her
oath
did
not
know
the
difference
between
an
alley
tor
and
a
by
the
during
the
period
of
her
keeping
company
with
sanders
had
received
love
letters
like
other
ladies
in
the
course
of
their
correspondence
sanders
had
often
called
her
a
duck
but
never
chops
nor
yet
tomato
he
was
particularly
fond
of
ducks
perhaps
if
he
had
been
as
fond
of
chops
and
tomato
sauce
he
might
have
called
her
that
as
a
term
of
affection
serjeant
buzfuz
now
rose
with
more
importance
than
he
had
yet
exhibited
if
that
were
possible
and
vociferated
call
samuel
it
was
quite
unnecessary
to
call
samuel
weller
for
samuel
weller
stepped
briskly
into
the
box
the
instant
his
name
was
pronounced
and
placing
his
hat
on
the
floor
and
his
arms
on
the
rail
took
a
bird
eye
view
of
the
bar
and
a
comprehensive
survey
of
the
bench
with
a
remarkably
cheerful
and
lively
aspect
what
s
your
name
sir
inquired
the
judge
sam
weller
my
lord
replied
that
gentleman
do
you
spell
it
with
a
v
or
a
w
inquired
the
judge
that
depends
upon
the
taste
and
fancy
of
the
speller
my
lord
replied
sam
i
never
had
occasion
to
spell
it
more
than
once
or
twice
in
my
life
but
i
spells
it
with
a

a
voice
in
the
gallery
exclaimed
aloud
quite
right
too
samivel
quite
right

little
judge

that
person
here

but
as
the
usher
didn
t
find
the
person

didn
t
bring
him
and
after
a
great
commotion
all
the
people
who
had
got
up
to
look
for
the
culprit
sat
down
again
the
little
judge
turned
to
the
witness
as
soon
as
his
indignation
would
allow
him
to
speak
and
said
do
you
know
who
that
was
sir

rayther

my
father

lord
replied
sam

the
judge
no

t
my
lord
replied
sam
staring
right
up
into
the
lantern
at
the
roof
of
the
court
if
you
could
have
pointed
him
out
i
would
have
committed
him
instantly
said
the
judge
sam
bowed
his
acknowledgments
and
turned
with
unimpaired
cheerfulness
of
countenance
towards
serjeant
buzfuz
now
weller
said
serjeant
buzfuz

serjeant
buzfuz
with
jocularity
oh
quite
enough
to
get
sir
as
the
soldier
said
ven
they
ordered
him
three
hundred
and
fifty
lashes
replied
sam

must
not
tell
us
what
the
soldier
or
any
other
man
said
sir
interposed
the
judge
it
s
not
wery
good
my
lord
replied
sam
do
you
recollect
anything
particular
happening
on
the
morning
when
you
were
first
engaged
by
the
defendant
eh
weller
said
serjeant
buzfuz
yes
i
do
sir
replied
sam
have
the
goodness
to
tell
the
jury
what
it
i
had
a
reg
lar
new
fit
out
o
clothes
that
mornin
gen
l
men
of
the
jury
said
sam
and
that
was
a
wery
partickler
and
uncommon
circumstance
vith
me
in
those
hereupon
there
was
a
general
laugh
and
the
little
judge
looking
with
an
angry
countenance
over
his
desk
said
you
had
better
be
careful
so
pickwick
said
at
the
time
my
lord
replied
sam
and
i
was
wery
careful
o
that
ere
suit
o
clothes
wery
careful
indeed
my
the
judge
looked
sternly
at
sam
for
full
two
minutes
but
sam
s
features
were
so
perfectly
calm
and
serene
that
the
judge
said
nothing
and
motioned
serjeant
buzfuz
to
proceed
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
weller
said
serjeant
buzfuz
folding
his
arms
emphatically
and
turning
to
the
jury
as
if
in
mute
assurance
that
he
would
bother
the
witness
yet
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
weller
that
you
saw
nothing
of
this
fainting
on
the
part
of
the
plaintiff
in
the
arms
of
the
defendant
which
you
have
heard
described
by
the
witnesses
certainly
not
replied
sam
i
was
in
the
passage
till
they
called
me
up
and
then
the
old
lady
was
not
now
attend
weller
said
serjeant
buzfuz
dipping
a
large
pen
into
the
inkstand
before
him
for
the
purpose
of
frightening
sam
with
a
show
of
taking
down
his
answer
you
were
in
the
passage
and
yet
saw
nothing
of
what
was
going
forward
have
you
a
pair
of
eyes
weller
yes
i
have
a
pair
of
eyes
replied
sam
and
that
s
just
it
if
they
wos
a
pair
o
patent
double
million
magnifyin
gas
microscopes
of
hextra
power
p
raps
i
might
be
able
to
see
through
a
flight
o
stairs
and
a
deal
door
but
bein
only
eyes
you
see
my
wision
s
at
this
answer
which
was
delivered
without
the
slightest
appearance
of
irritation
and
with
the
most
complete
simplicity
and
equanimity
of
manner
the
spectators
tittered
the
little
judge
smiled
and
serjeant
buzfuz
looked
particularly
foolish
after
a
short
consultation
with
dodson
fogg
the
learned
serjeant
again
turned
towards
sam
and
said
with
a
painful
effort
to
conceal
his
vexation
now
weller
i
ll
ask
you
a
question
on
another
point
if
you
if
you
please
sir
rejoined
sam
with
the
utmost
do
you
remember
going
up
to
bardell
s
house
one
night
in
november
last
oh
yes
wery
oh
you
do
remember
that
weller
said
serjeant
buzfuz
recovering
his
spirits
i
thought
we
should
get
at
something
at
i
rayther
thought
that
too
sir
replied
sam
and
at
this
the
spectators
tittered
again
well
i
suppose
you
went
up
to
have
a
little
talk
about
this
trial
eh
weller
said
serjeant
buzfuz
looking
knowingly
at
the
jury
i
went
up
to
pay
the
rent
but
we
did
get
about
the
trial
replied
sam
oh
you
did
get
about
the
trial
said
serjeant
buzfuz
brightening
up
with
the
anticipation
of
some
important
discovery
now
what
passed
about
the
trial
will
you
have
the
goodness
to
tell
us
weller
vith
all
the
pleasure
in
life
sir
replied
sam
arter
a
few
unimportant
obserwations
from
the
two
wirtuous
females
as
has
been
examined
here
the
ladies
gets
into
a
very
great
state
o
admiration
at
the
honourable
conduct
of
dodson
and
fogg
them
two
gen
l
men
as
is
settin
near
you
this
of
course
drew
general
attention
to
dodson
fogg
who
looked
as
virtuous
as
possible
the
attorneys
for
the
plaintiff
said
serjeant
buzfuz
well
they
spoke
in
high
praise
of
the
honourable
conduct
of
dodson
and
fogg
the
attorneys
for
the
plaintiff
did
they
yes
said
sam
they
said
what
a
wery
gen
rous
thing
it
was
o
them
to
have
taken
up
the
case
on
spec
and
to
charge
nothing
at
all
for
costs
unless
they
got
em
out
of
at
this
very
unexpected
reply
the
spectators
tittered
again
and
dodson
fogg
turning
very
red
leaned
over
to
serjeant
buzfuz
and
in
a
hurried
manner
whispered
something
in
his
ear
you
are
quite
right
said
serjeant
buzfuz
aloud
with
affected
composure
it
s
perfectly
useless
my
lord
attempting
to
get
at
any
evidence
through
the
impenetrable
stupidity
of
this
witness
i
will
not
trouble
the
court
by
asking
him
any
more
questions
stand
down
would
any
other
gen
l
man
like
to
ask
me
anythin
inquired
sam
taking
up
his
hat
and
looking
round
most
deliberately
not
i
weller
thank
you
said
serjeant
snubbin
laughing
you
may
go
down
sir
said
serjeant
buzfuz
waving
his
hand
impatiently
sam
went
down
accordingly
after
doing
dodson
fogg
s
case
as
much
harm
as
he
conveniently
could
and
saying
just
as
little
respecting
pickwick
as
might
be
which
was
precisely
the
object
he
had
had
in
view
all
along
i
have
no
objection
to
admit
my
lord
said
serjeant
snubbin
if
it
will
save
the
examination
of
another
witness
that
pickwick
has
retired
from
business
and
is
a
gentleman
of
considerable
independent
very
well
said
serjeant
buzfuz
putting
in
the
two
letters
to
be
read
then
that
s
my
case
my
serjeant
snubbin
then
addressed
the
jury
on
behalf
of
the
defendant
and
a
very
long
and
a
very
emphatic
address
he
delivered
in
which
he
bestowed
the
highest
possible
eulogiums
on
the
conduct
and
character
of
pickwick
but
inasmuch
as
our
readers
are
far
better
able
to
form
a
correct
estimate
of
that
gentleman
s
merits
and
deserts
than
serjeant
snubbin
could
possibly
be
we
do
not
feel
called
upon
to
enter
at
any
length
into
the
learned
gentleman
s
observations
he
attempted
to
show
that
the
letters
which
had
been
exhibited
merely
related
to
pickwick
s
dinner
or
to
the
preparations
for
receiving
him
in
his
apartments
on
his
return
from
some
country
excursion
it
is
sufficient
to
add
in
general
terms
that
he
did
the
best
he
could
for
pickwick
and
the
best
as
everybody
knows
on
the
infallible
authority
of
the
old
adage
could
do
no
more
justice
stareleigh
summed
up
in
the
and
most
approved
form
he
read
as
much
of
his
notes
to
the
jury
as
he
could
decipher
on
so
short
a
notice
and
made
on
the
evidence
as
he
went
along
if
bardell
were
right
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
pickwick
was
wrong
and
if
they
thought
the
evidence
of
cluppins
worthy
of
credence
they
would
believe
it
and
if
they
didn
t
why
they
wouldn
t
if
they
were
satisfied
that
a
breach
of
promise
of
marriage
had
been
committed
they
would
find
for
the
plaintiff
with
such
damages
as
they
thought
proper
and
if
on
the
other
hand
it
appeared
to
them
that
no
promise
of
marriage
had
ever
been
given
they
would
find
for
the
defendant
with
no
damages
at
all
the
jury
then
retired
to
their
private
room
to
talk
the
matter
over
and
the
judge
retired
to
room
to
refresh
himself
with
a
mutton
chop
and
a
glass
of
sherry
an
anxious
quarter
of
a
hour
elapsed
the
jury
came
back
the
judge
was
fetched
in
pickwick
put
on
his
spectacles
and
gazed
at
the
foreman
with
an
agitated
countenance
and
a
heart
gentlemen
said
the
individual
in
black
are
you
all
agreed
upon
your
verdict
we
are
replied
the
foreman
do
you
find
for
the
plaintiff
gentlemen
or
for
the
defendant
for
the
with
what
damages
gentlemen
seven
hundred
and
fifty
pickwick
took
off
his
spectacles
carefully
wiped
the
glasses
folded
them
into
their
case
and
put
them
in
his
pocket
then
having
drawn
on
his
gloves
with
great
nicety
and
stared
at
the
foreman
all
the
while
he
mechanically
followed
perker
and
the
blue
bag
out
of
court
they
stopped
in
a
side
room
while
perker
paid
the
court
fees
and
here
pickwick
was
joined
by
his
friends
here
too
he
encountered
dodson
fogg
rubbing
their
hands
with
every
token
of
outward
satisfaction
well
gentlemen
said
pickwick
well
sir
said
dodson
for
self
and
partner
you
imagine
you
ll
get
your
costs
don
t
you
gentlemen
said
pickwick
fogg
said
they
thought
it
rather
probable
dodson
smiled
and
said
they
d
try
you
may
try
and
try
and
try
again
dodson
and
fogg
said
pickwick
vehemently
but
not
one
farthing
of
costs
or
damages
do
you
ever
get
from
me
if
i
spend
the
rest
of
my
existence
in
a
debtor
s
ha
ha
laughed
dodson
you
ll
think
better
of
that
before
next
term
he
he
he
we
ll
soon
see
about
that
pickwick
grinned
fogg
speechless
with
indignation
pickwick
allowed
himself
to
be
led
by
his
solicitor
and
friends
to
the
door
and
there
assisted
into
a
which
had
been
fetched
for
the
purpose
by
the
watchful
sam
weller
sam
had
put
up
the
steps
and
was
preparing
to
jump
upon
the
box
when
he
felt
himself
gently
touched
on
the
shoulder
and
looking
round
his
father
stood
before
him
the
old
gentleman
s
countenance
wore
a
mournful
expression
as
he
shook
his
head
gravely
and
said
in
warning
accents
i
know
d
what
ud
come
o
this
here
mode
o
doin
bisness
oh
sammy
sammy
vy
worn
t
there
a
alleybi
chapter
xxxv
in
which
pickwick
thinks
he
had
better
go
to
bath
and
goes
accordingly
but
surely
my
dear
sir
said
little
perker
as
he
stood
in
pickwick
s
apartment
on
the
morning
after
the
trial
surely
you
don
t
really
mean
really
and
seriously
now
and
irritation
apart
that
you
won
t
pay
these
costs
and
damages
not
one
halfpenny
said
pickwick
firmly
not
one
hooroar
for
the
principle
as
the
said
ven
he
vouldn
t
renew
the
bill
observed
weller
who
was
clearing
away
the
sam
said
pickwick
have
the
goodness
to
step
cert
nly
sir
replied
weller
and
acting
on
pickwick
s
gentle
hint
sam
retired
no
perker
said
pickwick
with
great
seriousness
of
manner
my
friends
here
have
endeavoured
to
dissuade
me
from
this
determination
but
without
avail
i
shall
employ
myself
as
usual
until
the
opposite
party
have
the
power
of
issuing
a
legal
process
of
execution
against
me
and
if
they
are
vile
enough
to
avail
themselves
of
it
and
to
arrest
my
person
i
shall
yield
myself
up
with
perfect
cheerfulness
and
content
of
heart
when
can
they
do
this
they
can
issue
execution
my
dear
sir
for
the
amount
of
the
damages
and
taxed
costs
next
term
replied
perker
just
two
months
hence
my
dear
very
good
said
pickwick
until
that
time
my
dear
fellow
let
me
hear
no
more
of
the
matter
and
now
continued
pickwick
looking
round
on
his
friends
with
a
smile
and
a
sparkle
in
the
eye
which
no
spectacles
could
dim
or
conceal
the
only
question
is
where
shall
we
go
next
tupman
and
snodgrass
were
too
much
affected
by
their
friend
s
heroism
to
offer
any
reply
winkle
had
not
yet
sufficiently
recovered
the
recollection
of
his
evidence
at
the
trial
to
make
any
observation
on
any
subject
so
pickwick
paused
in
vain
well
said
that
gentleman
if
you
leave
me
to
suggest
our
destination
i
say
bath
i
think
none
of
us
have
ever
been
nobody
had
and
as
the
proposition
was
warmly
seconded
by
perker
who
considered
it
extremely
probable
that
if
pickwick
saw
a
little
change
and
gaiety
he
would
be
inclined
to
think
better
of
his
determination
and
worse
of
a
debtor
s
prison
it
was
carried
unanimously
and
sam
was
at
once
despatched
to
the
white
horse
cellar
to
take
five
places
by
the
seven
o
clock
coach
next
morning
there
were
just
two
places
to
be
had
inside
and
just
three
to
be
had
out
so
sam
weller
booked
for
them
all
and
having
exchanged
a
few
compliments
with
the
clerk
on
the
subject
of
a
pewter
which
was
tendered
him
as
a
portion
of
his
change
walked
back
to
the
george
and
vulture
where
he
was
pretty
busily
employed
until
in
reducing
clothes
and
linen
into
the
smallest
possible
compass
and
exerting
his
mechanical
genius
in
constructing
a
variety
of
ingenious
devices
for
keeping
the
lids
on
boxes
which
had
neither
locks
nor
hinges
the
next
was
a
very
unpropitious
morning
for
a
journey
muggy
damp
and
drizzly
the
horses
in
the
stages
that
were
going
out
and
had
come
through
the
city
were
smoking
so
that
the
outside
passengers
were
invisible
the
looked
moist
and
smelled
mouldy
the
wet
ran
off
the
hats
of
the
as
they
thrust
their
heads
into
the
coach
windows
and
diluted
the
insides
in
a
refreshing
manner
the
jews
with
the
penknives
shut
them
up
in
despair
the
men
with
the
made
of
them
and
were
alike
at
a
discount
and
and
sponges
were
a
drug
in
the
market
leaving
sam
weller
to
rescue
the
luggage
from
the
seven
or
eight
porters
who
flung
themselves
savagely
upon
it
the
moment
the
coach
stopped
and
finding
that
they
were
about
twenty
minutes
too
early
pickwick
and
his
friends
went
for
shelter
into
the
travellers
room
the
last
resource
of
human
dejection
the
travellers
room
at
the
white
horse
cellar
is
of
course
uncomfortable
it
would
be
no
travellers
room
if
it
were
not
it
is
the
parlour
into
which
an
aspiring
kitchen
fireplace
appears
to
have
walked
accompanied
by
a
rebellious
poker
tongs
and
shovel
it
is
divided
into
boxes
for
the
solitary
confinement
of
travellers
and
is
furnished
with
a
clock
a
and
a
live
waiter
which
latter
article
is
kept
in
a
small
kennel
for
washing
glasses
in
a
corner
of
the
apartment
one
of
these
boxes
was
occupied
on
this
particular
occasion
by
a
man
of
about
who
had
a
bald
and
glossy
forehead
with
a
good
deal
of
black
hair
at
the
sides
and
back
of
his
head
and
large
black
whiskers
he
was
buttoned
up
to
the
chin
in
a
brown
coat
and
had
a
large
sealskin
and
a
greatcoat
and
cloak
lying
on
the
seat
beside
him
he
looked
up
from
his
breakfast
as
pickwick
entered
with
a
fierce
and
peremptory
air
which
was
very
dignified
and
having
scrutinised
that
gentleman
and
his
companions
to
his
entire
satisfaction
hummed
a
tune
in
a
manner
which
seemed
to
say
that
he
rather
suspected
somebody
wanted
to
take
advantage
of
him
but
it
wouldn
t
do
waiter
said
the
gentleman
with
the
whiskers
sir
replied
a
man
with
a
dirty
complexion
and
a
towel
of
the
same
emerging
from
the
kennel
before
mentioned
some
more
yes
buttered
toast

said
the
gentleman
fiercely
directly
sir
replied
the
waiter
the
gentleman
with
the
whiskers
hummed
a
tune
in
the
same
manner
as
before
and
pending
the
arrival
of
the
toast
advanced
to
the
front
of
the
fire
and
taking
his
coat
tails
under
his
arms
looked
at
his
boots
and
ruminated
i
wonder
whereabouts
in
bath
this
coach
puts
up
said
pickwick
mildly
addressing
winkle
hum
eh
what
s
that
said
the
strange
man
i
made
an
observation
to
my
friend
sir
replied
pickwick
always
ready
to
enter
into
conversation
i
wondered
at
what
house
the
bath
coach
put
up
perhaps
you
can
inform
are
you
going
to
bath
said
the
strange
man
i
am
sir
replied
pickwick
and
those
other
gentlemen
they
are
going
also
said
pickwick
not
inside
i
ll
be
damned
if
you
re
going
inside
said
the
strange
man
not
all
of
us
said
pickwick
no
not
all
of
you
said
the
strange
man
emphatically
i
ve
taken
two
places
if
they
try
to
squeeze
six
people
into
an
infernal
box
that
only
holds
four
i
ll
take
a
and
bring
an
action
i
ve
paid
my
fare
it
won
t
do
i
told
the
clerk
when
i
took
my
places
that
it
wouldn
t
do
i
know
these
things
have
been
done
i
know
they
are
done
every
day
but
i
never
was
done
and
i
never
will
be
those
who
know
me
best
best
know
it
crush
me
here
the
fierce
gentleman
rang
the
bell
with
great
violence
and
told
the
waiter
he
d
better
bring
the
toast
in
five
seconds
or
he
d
know
the
reason
why
my
good
sir
said
pickwick
you
will
allow
me
to
observe
that
this
is
a
very
unnecessary
display
of
excitement
i
have
only
taken
places
inside
for
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
said
the
fierce
man
i
withdraw
my
expressions
i
tender
an
apology
there
s
my
card

me
your
with
great
pleasure
sir
replied
pickwick
we
are
to
be
travellers
and
i
hope
we
shall
find
each
other
s
society
mutually
i
hope
we

said
the
fierce
gentleman
i
know
we
shall
i
like
your
looks
they
please
me
gentlemen
your
hands
and
names
know
of
course
an
interchange
of
friendly
salutations
followed
this
gracious
speech
and
the
fierce
gentleman
immediately
proceeded
to
inform
the
friends
in
the
same
short
abrupt
jerking
sentences
that
his
name
was
dowler
that
he
was
going
to
bath
on
pleasure
that
he
was
formerly
in
the
army
that
he
had
now
set
up
in
business
as
a
gentleman
that
he
lived
upon
the
profits
and
that
the
individual
for
whom
the
second
place
was
taken
was
a
personage
no
less
illustrious
than
dowler
his
lady
wife
she
s
a
fine
woman
said
dowler
i
am
proud
of
her
i
have
i
hope
i
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
judging
said
pickwick
with
a
smile
you
shall
replied
dowler
she
shall
know
you
she
shall
esteem
you
i
courted
her
under
singular
circumstances
i
won
her
through
a
rash
vow
thus
i
saw
her
i
loved
her
i
proposed
she
refused
you
love
another
spare
my
i
know
you
very
good
if
he
remains
here
i
ll
skin
lord
bless
me
exclaimed
pickwick
involuntarily
did
you
skin
the
gentleman
sir
inquired
winkle
with
a
very
pale
face
i
wrote
him
a
note
i
said
it
was
a
painful
thing
and
so
it
certainly
interposed
winkle
i
said
i
had
pledged
my
word
as
a
gentleman
to
skin
him
my
character
was
at
stake
i
had
no
alternative
as
an
officer
in
his
majesty
s
service
i
was
bound
to
skin
him
i
regretted
the
necessity
but
it
must
be
done
he
was
open
to
conviction
he
saw
that
the
rules
of
the
service
were
imperative
he
fled
i
married
her
here
s
the
coach
that
s
her
as
dowler
concluded
he
pointed
to
a
stage
which
had
just
driven
up
from
the
open
window
of
which
a
rather
pretty
face
in
a
bright
blue
bonnet
was
looking
among
the
crowd
on
the
pavement
most
probably
for
the
rash
man
himself
dowler
paid
his
bill
and
hurried
out
with
his
travelling
cap
coat
and
cloak
and
pickwick
and
his
friends
followed
to
secure
their
places
tupman
and
snodgrass
had
seated
themselves
at
the
back
part
of
the
coach
winkle
had
got
inside
and
pickwick
was
preparing
to
follow
him
when
sam
weller
came
up
to
his
master
and
whispering
in
his
ear
begged
to
speak
to
him
with
an
air
of
the
deepest
mystery
well
sam
said
pickwick
what
s
the
matter
now
here
s
rayther
a
rum
go
sir
replied
sam
what
inquired
pickwick
this
here
sir
rejoined
sam
i
m
wery
much
afeerd
sir
that
the
properiator
o
this
here
coach
is
a
playin
some
imperence
vith
how
is
that
sam
said
pickwick
aren
t
the
names
down
on
the
the
names
is
not
only
down
on
the
sir
replied
sam
but
they
ve
painted
vun
on
em
up
on
the
door
o
the
as
sam
spoke
he
pointed
to
that
part
of
the
coach
door
on
which
the
proprietor
s
name
usually
appears
and
there
sure
enough
in
gilt
letters
of
a
goodly
size
was
the
magic
name
of
dear
me
exclaimed
pickwick
quite
staggered
by
the
coincidence
what
a
very
extraordinary
thing
yes
but
that
ain
t
all
said
sam
again
directing
his
master
s
attention
to
the
coach
door
not
content
vith
writin
up
they
puts
moses
afore
it
vich
i
call
addin
insult
to
injury
as
the
parrot
said
ven
they
not
only
took
him
from
his
native
land
but
made
him
talk
the
english
langwidge
it
s
odd
enough
certainly
sam
said
pickwick
but
if
we
stand
talking
here
we
shall
lose
our
wot
ain
t
nothin
to
be
done
in
consequence
sir
exclaimed
sam
perfectly
aghast
at
the
coolness
with
which
pickwick
prepared
to
ensconce
himself
inside
done
said
pickwick
what
should
be
done
ain
t
nobody
to
be
whopped
for
takin
this
here
liberty
sir
said
weller
who
had
expected
that
at
least
he
would
have
been
commissioned
to
challenge
the
guard
and
the
coachman
to
a
pugilistic
encounter
on
the
spot
certainly
not
replied
pickwick
eagerly
not
on
any
account
jump
up
to
your
seat
i
am
wery
much
afeered
muttered
sam
to
himself
as
he
turned
away
that
somethin
queer
s
come
over
the
governor
or
he
d
never
ha
stood
this
so
quiet
i
hope
that
ere
trial
hasn
t
broke
his
spirit
but
it
looks
bad
wery
weller
shook
his
head
gravely
and
it
is
worthy
of
remark
as
an
illustration
of
the
manner
in
which
he
took
this
circumstance
to
heart
that
he
did
not
speak
another
word
until
the
coach
reached
the
kensington
turnpike
which
was
so
long
a
time
for
him
to
remain
taciturn
that
the
fact
may
be
considered
wholly
unprecedented
nothing
worthy
of
special
mention
occurred
during
the
journey
dowler
related
a
variety
of
anecdotes
all
illustrative
of
his
own
personal
prowess
and
desperation
and
appealed
to
dowler
in
corroboration
thereof
when
dowler
invariably
brought
in
in
the
form
of
an
appendix
some
remarkable
fact
or
circumstance
which
dowler
had
forgotten
or
had
perhaps
through
modesty
omitted
for
the
addenda
in
every
instance
went
to
show
that
dowler
was
even
a
more
wonderful
fellow
than
he
made
himself
out
to
be
pickwick
and
winkle
listened
with
great
admiration
and
at
intervals
conversed
with
dowler
who
was
a
very
agreeable
and
fascinating
person
so
what
between
dowler
s
stories
and
dowler
s
charms
and
pickwick
s
and
winkle
s
good
listening
the
insides
contrived
to
be
very
companionable
all
the
way
the
outsides
did
as
outsides
always
do
they
were
very
cheerful
and
talkative
at
the
beginning
of
every
stage
and
very
dismal
and
sleepy
in
the
middle
and
very
bright
and
wakeful
again
towards
the
end
there
was
one
young
gentleman
in
an
cloak
who
smoked
cigars
all
day
and
there
was
another
young
gentleman
in
a
parody
upon
a
greatcoat
who
lighted
a
good
many
and
feeling
obviously
unsettled
after
the
second
whiff
threw
them
away
when
he
thought
nobody
was
looking
at
him
there
was
a
third
young
man
on
the
box
who
wished
to
be
learned
in
cattle
and
an
old
one
behind
who
was
familiar
with
farming
there
was
a
constant
succession
of
christian
names
in
and
white
coats
who
were
invited
to
have
a
lift
by
the
guard
and
who
knew
every
horse
and
hostler
on
the
road
and
off
it
and
there
was
a
dinner
which
would
have
been
cheap
at
a
mouth
if
any
moderate
number
of
mouths
could
have
eaten
it
in
the
time
and
at
seven
o
clock
pickwick
and
his
friends
and
dowler
and
his
wife
respectively
retired
to
their
private
at
the
white
hart
hotel
opposite
the
great
pump
room
bath
where
the
waiters
from
their
costume
might
be
mistaken
for
westminster
boys
only
they
destroy
the
illusion
by
behaving
themselves
much
better
breakfast
had
scarcely
been
cleared
away
on
the
succeeding
morning
when
a
waiter
brought
in
dowler
s
card
with
a
request
to
be
allowed
permission
to
introduce
a
friend
dowler
at
once
followed
up
the
delivery
of
the
card
by
bringing
himself
and
the
friend
also
the
friend
was
a
charming
young
man
of
not
much
more
than
fifty
dressed
in
a
very
bright
blue
coat
with
resplendent
buttons
black
trousers
and
the
thinnest
possible
pair
of
boots
a
gold
was
suspended
from
his
neck
by
a
short
broad
black
ribbon
a
gold
was
lightly
clasped
in
his
left
hand
gold
rings
innumerable
glittered
on
his
fingers
and
a
large
diamond
pin
set
in
gold
glistened
in
his
shirt
frill
he
had
a
gold
watch
and
a
gold
curb
chain
with
large
gold
seals
and
he
carried
a
pliant
ebony
cane
with
a
gold
top
his
linen
was
of
the
very
whitest
finest
and
stiffest
his
wig
of
the
glossiest
blackest
and
curliest
his
snuff
was
princes
mixture
his
scent
du
his
features
were
contracted
into
a
perpetual
smile
and
his
teeth
were
in
such
perfect
order
that
it
was
difficult
at
a
small
distance
to
tell
the
real
from
the
false

were
the
expressions
with
which
angelo
cyrus

took
pickwick
s
hand
retaining
it
in
his
meantime
and
shrugging
up
his
shoulders
with
a
constant
succession
of
bows
as
if
he
really
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
the
trial
of
letting
it

the
use
of
his
limbs
from
imprudently
taking
cold
after
port
wine
who
could
not
be
moved
in
consequence
of
acute
suffering
and
who
had
the

at
one

and

to

the

the

by
the

of

who
are
quite
inconsistent
with

and
who
have
an
amalgamation
of
themselves
at
the
guildhall
every
fortnight
which
is
to
say
the
least
remarkable

angelo

stepped
into
a
very
elegant
chariot
that
waited
at
the
door
and
rattled
off
at
the
appointed
hour
pickwick
and
his
friends
escorted
by
dowler
repaired
to
the
assembly
rooms
and
wrote
their
names
down
in
the
book
an
instance
of
condescension
at
which
angelo
bantam
was
even
more
overpowered
than
before
tickets
of
admission
to
that
evening
s
assembly
were
to
have
been
prepared
for
the
whole
party
but
as
they
were
not
ready
pickwick
undertook
despite
all
the
protestations
to
the
contrary
of
angelo
bantam
to
send
sam
for
them
at
four
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
to
the
s
house
in
queen
square
having
taken
a
short
walk
through
the
city
and
arrived
at
the
unanimous
conclusion
that
park
street
was
very
much
like
the
perpendicular
streets
a
man
sees
in
a
dream
which
he
can
not
get
up
for
the
life
of
him
they
returned
to
the
white
hart
and
despatched
sam
on
the
errand
to
which
his
master
had
pledged
him
sam
weller
put
on
his
hat
in
a
very
easy
and
graceful
manner
and
thrusting
his
hands
in
his
waistcoat
pockets
walked
with
great
deliberation
to
queen
square
whistling
as
he
went
along
several
of
the
most
popular
airs
of
the
day
as
arranged
with
entirely
new
movements
for
that
noble
instrument
the
organ
either
mouth
or
barrel
arriving
at
the
number
in
queen
square
to
which
he
had
been
directed
he
left
off
whistling
and
gave
a
cheerful
knock
which
was
instantaneously
answered
by
a
footman
in
gorgeous
livery
and
of
symmetrical
stature
is
this
here
bantam
s
old
feller
inquired
sam
weller
nothing
abashed
by
the
blaze
of
splendour
which
burst
upon
his
sight
in
the
person
of
the
footman
with
the
gorgeous
livery
why
young
man
was
the
haughty
inquiry
of
the
footman
cos
if
it
is
jist
you
step
in
to
him
with
that
ere
card
and
say
veller
s
will
you
said
sam
and
saying
it
he
very
coolly
walked
into
the
hall
and
sat
down
the
footman
slammed
the
door
very
hard
and
scowled
very
grandly
but
both
the
slam
and
the
scowl
were
lost
upon
sam
who
was
regarding
a
mahogany
with
every
outward
token
of
critical
approval
apparently
his
master
s
reception
of
the
card
had
impressed
the
footman
in
sam
s
favour
for
when
he
came
back
from
delivering
it
he
smiled
in
a
friendly
manner
and
said
that
the
answer
would
be
ready
directly
wery
good

of

said
the
footman
taking
sam
s
remarks
as
a
high
compliment
very
much
so
indeed
do
you
do
anything
in
this
way
sir
inquired
the
tall
footman
producing
a
small
with
a
fox
s
head
on
the
top
of
it
not
without
sneezing
replied
sam
why
it
difficult
sir
i
confess
said
the
tall
footman
it
may
be
done
by
degrees
sir
coffee
is
the
best
practice
i
carried
coffee
sir
for
a
long
time
it
looks
very
like
rappee
here
a
sharp
peal
at
the
bell
reduced
the
footman
to
the
ignominious
necessity
of
putting
the
fox
s
head
in
his
pocket
and
hastening
with
a
humble
countenance
to
bantam
s
by
the
bye
who
ever
knew
a
man
who
never
read
or
wrote
either
who
hadn
t
got
some
small
back
parlour
which
he
a
study
there

the
answer
sir
said
the
footman
i
m
afraid

find
it
inconveniently
don
t
mention
it
said
sam
taking
a
letter
with
a
small
enclosure
it
s
just
possible
as
exhausted
natur
may
manage
to

i
hope

shall
meet

sir
said
the
footman
rubbing
his
hands
and
following
sam
out
to
the
you
are
wery
obligin
sir
replied
sam
now
don
t
allow
yourself
to
be
fatigued
beyond
your
powers
there
s
a
amiable
bein
consider
what
you
owe
to
society
and
don
t
let
yourself
be
injured
by
too
much
work
for
the
sake
o
your
keep
yourself
as
quiet
as
you
can
only
think
what
a
loss
you
would
be
with
these
pathetic
words
sam
weller
departed
a
very
singular
young
man
that
said
the
footman
looking
after
weller
with
a
countenance
which
clearly
showed
he
could
make
nothing
of
him
sam
said
nothing
at
all
he
winked
shook
his
head
smiled
winked
again
and
with
an
expression
of
countenance
which
seemed
to
denote
that
he
was
greatly
amused
with
something
or
other
walked
merrily
away
at
precisely
twenty
minutes
before
eight
o
clock
that
night
angelo
cyrus
bantam
the
master
of
the
ceremonies
emerged
from
his
chariot
at
the
door
of
the
assembly
rooms
in
the
same
wig
the
same
teeth
the
same
the
same
watch
and
seals
the
same
rings
the
same
and
the
same
cane
the
only
observable
alterations
in
his
appearance
were
that
he
wore
a
brighter
blue
coat
with
a
white
silk
lining
black
tights
black
silk
stockings
and
pumps
and
a
white
waistcoat
and
was
if
possible
just
a
thought
more
scented
thus
attired
the
master
of
the
ceremonies
in
strict
discharge
of
the
important
duties
of
his
office
planted
himself
in
the
room
to
receive
the
company
bath
being
full
the
company
and
the
sixpences
for
tea
poured
in
in
shoals
in
the
ballroom
the
long
the
octagonal
the
staircases
and
the
passages
the
hum
of
many
voices
and
the
sound
of
many
feet
were
perfectly
bewildering
dresses
rustled
feathers
waved
lights
shone
and
jewels
sparkled
there
was
the
music
not
of
the
quadrille
band
for
it
had
not
yet
commenced
but
the
music
of
soft
tiny
footsteps
with
now
and
then
a
clear
merry
laugh
low
and
gentle
but
very
pleasant
to
hear
in
a
female
voice
whether
in
bath
or
elsewhere
brilliant
eyes
lighted
up
with
pleasurable
expectation
gleamed
from
every
side
and
look
where
you
would
some
exquisite
form
glided
gracefully
through
the
throng
and
was
no
sooner
lost
than
it
was
replaced
by
another
as
dainty
and
bewitching
in
the
and
hovering
round
the
were
a
vast
number
of
queer
old
ladies
and
decrepit
old
gentlemen
discussing
all
the
small
talk
and
scandal
of
the
day
with
a
relish
and
gusto
which
sufficiently
bespoke
the
intensity
of
the
pleasure
they
derived
from
the
occupation
mingled
with
these
groups
were
three
or
four
mammas
appearing
to
be
wholly
absorbed
by
the
conversation
in
which
they
were
taking
part
but
failing
not
from
time
to
time
to
cast
an
anxious
sidelong
glance
upon
their
daughters
who
remembering
the
maternal
injunction
to
make
the
best
use
of
their
youth
had
already
commenced
incipient
flirtations
in
the
mislaying
scarves
putting
on
gloves
setting
down
cups
and
so
forth
slight
matters
apparently
but
which
may
be
turned
to
surprisingly
good
account
by
expert
practitioners
lounging
near
the
doors
and
in
remote
corners
were
various
knots
of
silly
young
men
displaying
various
varieties
of
puppyism
and
stupidity
amusing
all
sensible
people
near
them
with
their
folly
and
conceit
and
happily
thinking
themselves
the
objects
of
general
admiration
a
wise
and
merciful
dispensation
which
no
good
man
will
quarrel
with
and
lastly
seated
on
some
of
the
back
benches
where
they
had
already
taken
up
their
positions
for
the
evening
were
divers
unmarried
ladies
past
their
grand
climacteric
who
not
dancing
because
there
were
no
partners
for
them
and
not
playing
cards
lest
they
should
be
set
down
as
irretrievably
single
were
in
the
favourable
situation
of
being
able
to
abuse
everybody
without
reflecting
on
themselves
in
short
they
could
abuse
everybody
because
everybody
was
there
it
was
a
scene
of
gaiety
glitter
and
show
of
people
handsome
mirrors
chalked
floors
girandoles
and
and
in
all
parts
of
the
scene
gliding
from
spot
to
spot
in
silent
softness
bowing
obsequiously
to
this
party
nodding
familiarly
to
that
and
smiling
complacently
on
all

the
person
of

dowler
in
a
loud
voice
directing
pickwick
who
advanced
at
the
head
of
the
little
party
with
dowler
on
his
arm
into
the
pickwick
turned
and
catching
sight
of
him
bantam
corkscrewed
his
way
through
the
crowd
and
welcomed
him
with
ecstasy

inquired
the

crushton
after
a
short
pause
during
which
young
lord
mutanhed
had
been
endeavouring
to
stare
pickwick
out
of
countenance
and
crushton
had
been
reflecting
what
subject

heartily
as

the
listeners

then
drawing
his
arm
through
that
of
the
obsequious
crushton
lord
mutanhed
walked
away
delightful
young
man
his
lordship
said
the
master
of
the
ceremonies
so
i
should
think
rejoined
pickwick
drily
the
dancing
having
commenced
the
necessary
introductions
having
been
made
and
all
preliminaries
arranged
angelo
bantam
rejoined
pickwick
and
led
him
into
the
just
at
the
very
moment
of
their
entrance
the
dowager
lady
snuphanuph
and
two
other
ladies
of
an
ancient
and
appearance
were
hovering
over
an
unoccupied
and
they
no
sooner
set
eyes
upon
pickwick
under
the
convoy
of
angelo
bantam
than
they
exchanged
glances
with
each
other
seeing
that
he
was
precisely
the
very
person
they
wanted
to
make
up
the
rubber
my
dear
bantam
said
the
dowager
lady
snuphanuph
coaxingly
find
us
some
nice
creature
to
make
up
this
table
there
s
a
good
pickwick
happened
to
be
looking
another
way
at
the
moment
so
her
ladyship
nodded
her
head
towards
him
and
frowned
expressively
my
friend
pickwick
my
lady
will
be
most
happy
i
am
sure
remarkably
so
said
the
taking
the
hint
mr
pickwick
lady
snuphanuph
mrs
colonel
wugsby
miss
pickwick
bowed
to
each
of
the
ladies
and
finding
escape
impossible
cut
pickwick
and
miss
bolo
against
lady
snuphanuph
and
mrs
colonel
wugsby
as
the
trump
card
was
turned
up
at
the
commencement
of
the
second
deal
two
young
ladies
hurried
into
the
room
and
took
their
stations
on
either
side
of
mrs
colonel
wugsby
s
chair
where
they
waited
patiently
until
the
hand
was
over
now
jane
said
mrs
colonel
wugsby
turning
to
one
of
the
girls
what
is
it
i
came
to
ask
ma
whether
i
might
dance
with
the
youngest
crawley
whispered
the
prettier
and
younger
of
the
two
good
god
jane
how
can
you
think
of
such
things
replied
the
mamma
indignantly
haven
t
you
repeatedly
heard
that
his
father
has
eight
hundred
a
year
which
dies
with
him
i
am
ashamed
of
you
not
on
any
ma
whispered
the
other
who
was
much
older
than
her
sister
and
very
insipid
and
artificial
lord
mutanhed
has
been
introduced
to
me
i
said
i
thought
i
wasn
t
engaged
you
re
a
sweet
pet
my
love
replied
mrs
colonel
wugsby
tapping
her
daughter
s
cheek
with
her
fan
and
are
always
to
be
trusted
he
s
immensely
rich
my
dear
bless
you
with
these
words
mrs
colonel
wugsby
kissed
her
eldest
daughter
most
affectionately
and
frowning
in
a
warning
manner
upon
the
other
sorted
her
cards
poor
pickwick
he
had
never
played
with
three
female
before
they
were
so
desperately
sharp
that
they
quite
frightened
him
if
he
played
a
wrong
card
miss
bolo
looked
a
small
armoury
of
daggers
if
he
stopped
to
consider
which
was
the
right
one
lady
snuphanuph
would
throw
herself
back
in
her
chair
and
smile
with
a
mingled
glance
of
impatience
and
pity
to
mrs
colonel
wugsby
at
which
mrs
colonel
wugsby
would
shrug
up
her
shoulders
and
cough
as
much
as
to
say
she
wondered
whether
he
ever
would
begin
then
at
the
end
of
every
hand
miss
bolo
would
inquire
with
a
dismal
countenance
and
reproachful
sigh
why
pickwick
had
not
returned
that
diamond
or
led
the
club
or
roughed
the
spade
or
finessed
the
heart
or
led
through
the
honour
or
brought
out
the
ace
or
played
up
to
the
king
or
some
such
thing
and
in
reply
to
all
these
grave
charges
pickwick
would
be
wholly
unable
to
plead
any
justification
whatever
having
by
this
time
forgotten
all
about
the
game
people
came
and
looked
on
too
which
made
pickwick
nervous
besides
all
this
there
was
a
great
deal
of
distracting
conversation
near
the
table
between
angelo
bantam
and
the
two
misses
matinter
who
being
single
and
singular
paid
great
court
to
the
master
of
the
ceremonies
in
the
hope
of
getting
a
stray
partner
now
and
then
all
these
things
combined
with
the
noises
and
interruptions
of
constant
comings
in
and
goings
out
made
pickwick
play
rather
badly
the
cards
were
against
him
also
and
when
they
left
off
at
ten
minutes
past
eleven
miss
bolo
rose
from
the
table
considerably
agitated
and
went
straight
home
in
a
flood
of
tears
and
a
being
joined
by
his
friends
who
one
and
all
protested
that
they
had
scarcely
ever
spent
a
more
pleasant
evening
pickwick
accompanied
them
to
the
white
hart
and
having
soothed
his
feelings
with
something
hot
went
to
bed
and
to
sleep
almost
simultaneously
chapter
xxxvi
the
chief
features
of
which
will
be
found
to
be
an
authentic
version
of
the
legend
of
prince
bladud
and
a
most
extraordinary
calamity
that
befell
winkle
as
pickwick
contemplated
a
stay
of
at
least
two
months
in
bath
he
deemed
it
advisable
to
take
private
lodgings
for
himself
and
friends
for
that
period
and
as
a
favourable
opportunity
offered
for
their
securing
on
moderate
terms
the
upper
portion
of
a
house
in
the
royal
crescent
which
was
larger
than
they
required
and
dowler
offered
to
relieve
them
of
a
bedroom
and
this
proposition
was
at
once
accepted
and
in
three
days
time
they
were
all
located
in
their
new
abode
when
pickwick
began
to
drink
the
waters
with
the
utmost
assiduity
pickwick
took
them
systematically
he
drank
a
quarter
of
a
pint
before
breakfast
and
then
walked
up
a
hill
and
another
quarter
of
a
pint
after
breakfast
and
then
walked
down
a
hill
and
after
every
fresh
quarter
of
a
pint
pickwick
declared
in
the
most
solemn
and
emphatic
terms
that
he
felt
a
great
deal
better
whereat
his
friends
were
very
much
delighted
though
they
had
not
been
previously
aware
that
there
was
anything
the
matter
with
him
the
great
pump
room
is
a
spacious
saloon
ornamented
with
corinthian
pillars
and
a
and
a
tompion
clock
and
a
statue
of
nash
and
a
golden
inscription
to
which
all
the
should
attend
for
it
appeals
to
them
in
the
cause
of
a
deserving
charity
there
is
a
large
bar
with
a
marble
vase
out
of
which
the
pumper
gets
the
water
and
there
are
a
number
of
tumblers
out
of
which
the
company
get
it
and
it
is
a
most
edifying
and
satisfactory
sight
to
behold
the
perseverance
and
gravity
with
which
they
swallow
it
there
are
baths
near
at
hand
in
which
a
part
of
the
company
wash
themselves
and
a
band
plays
afterwards
to
congratulate
the
remainder
on
their
having
done
so
there
is
another
pump
room
into
which
infirm
ladies
and
gentlemen
are
wheeled
in
such
an
astonishing
variety
of
chairs
and
chaises
that
any
adventurous
individual
who
goes
in
with
the
regular
number
of
toes
is
in
imminent
danger
of
coming
out
without
them
and
there
is
a
third
into
which
the
quiet
people
go
for
it
is
less
noisy
than
either
there
is
an
immensity
of
promenading
on
crutches
and
off
with
sticks
and
without
and
a
great
deal
of
conversation
and
liveliness
and
pleasantry
every
morning
the
regular
pickwick
among
the
number
met
each
other
in
the
pump
room
took
their
quarter
of
a
pint
and
walked
constitutionally
at
the
afternoon
s
promenade
lord
mutanhed
and
the
honourable
crushton
the
dowager
lady
snuphanuph
mrs
colonel
wugsby
and
all
the
great
people
and
all
the
morning
met
in
grand
assemblage
after
this
they
walked
out
or
drove
out
or
were
pushed
out
in
and
met
one
another
again
after
this
the
gentlemen
went
to
the
and
met
divisions
of
the
mass
after
this
they
went
home
if
it
were
perhaps
they
met
at
the
theatre
if
it
were
they
met
at
the
rooms
and
if
it
were
neither
they
met
the
next
day
a
very
pleasant
routine
with
perhaps
a
slight
tinge
of
sameness
pickwick
was
sitting
up
by
himself
after
a
day
spent
in
this
manner
making
entries
in
his
journal
his
friends
having
retired
to
bed
when
he
was
roused
by
a
gentle
tap
at
the
room
door
beg
your
pardon
sir
said
craddock
the
landlady
peeping
in
but
did
you
want
anything
more
sir
nothing
more
ma
am
replied
pickwick
my
young
girl
is
gone
to
bed
sir
said
craddock
and
dowler
is
good
enough
to
say
that
he
ll
sit
up
for
dowler
as
the
party
isn
t
expected
to
be
over
till
late
so
i
was
thinking
that
if
you
wanted
nothing
more
pickwick
i
would
go
to
by
all
means
ma
am
replied
pickwick
wish
you
sir
said
craddock
ma
am
rejoined
pickwick
craddock
closed
the
door
and
pickwick
resumed
his
writing
in
half
an
hour
s
time
the
entries
were
concluded
pickwick
carefully
rubbed
the
last
page
on
the
shut
up
the
book
wiped
his
pen
on
the
bottom
of
the
inside
of
his
coat
tail
and
opened
the
drawer
of
the
inkstand
to
put
it
carefully
away
there
were
a
couple
of
sheets
of
pretty
closely
written
over
in
the
inkstand
drawer
and
they
were
folded
so
that
the
title
which
was
in
a
good
round
hand
was
fully
disclosed
to
him
seeing
from
this
that
it
was
no
private
document
and
as
it
seemed
to
relate
to
bath
and
was
very
short
unfolded
it
lighted
his
bedroom
candle
that
it
might
burn
up
well
by
the
time
he
finished
and
drawing
his
chair
nearer
the
fire
read
as
follows
the
true
legend
of
prince
bladud
less
than
two
hundred
years
ago
on
one
of
the
public
baths
in
this
city
there
appeared
an
inscription
in
honour
of
its
mighty
founder
the
renowned
prince
bladud
that
inscription
is
now
erased
for
many
hundred
years
before
that
time
there
had
been
handed
down
from
age
to
age
an
old
legend
that
the
illustrious
prince
being
afflicted
with
leprosy
on
his
return
from
reaping
a
rich
harvest
of
knowledge
in
athens
shunned
the
court
of
his
royal
father
and
consorted
moodily
with
husbandman
and
pigs
among
the
herd
so
said
the
legend
was
a
pig
of
grave
and
solemn
countenance
with
whom
the
prince
had
a
for
he
too
was
wise
a
pig
of
thoughtful
and
reserved
demeanour
an
animal
superior
to
his
fellows
whose
grunt
was
terrible
and
whose
bite
was
sharp
the
young
prince
sighed
deeply
as
he
looked
upon
the
countenance
of
the
majestic
swine
he
thought
of
his
royal
father
and
his
eyes
were
bedewed
with
tears
this
sagacious
pig
was
fond
of
bathing
in
rich
moist
mud
not
in
summer
as
common
pigs
do
now
to
cool
themselves
and
did
even
in
those
distant
ages
which
is
a
proof
that
the
light
of
civilisation
had
already
begun
to
dawn
though
feebly
but
in
the
cold
sharp
days
of
winter
his
coat
was
ever
so
sleek
and
his
complexion
so
clear
that
the
prince
resolved
to
essay
the
purifying
qualities
of
the
same
water
that
his
friend
resorted
to
he
made
the
trial
beneath
that
black
mud
bubbled
the
hot
springs
of
bath
he
washed
and
was
cured
hastening
to
his
father
s
court
he
paid
his
best
respects
and
returning
quickly
hither
founded
this
city
and
its
famous
baths
he
sought
the
pig
with
all
the
ardour
of
their
early
friendship
but
alas
the
waters
had
been
his
death
he
had
imprudently
taken
a
bath
at
too
high
a
temperature
and
the
natural
philosopher
was
no
more
he
was
succeeded
by
pliny
who
also
fell
a
victim
to
his
thirst
for
knowledge
this
was
the
legend
listen
to
the
true
one
a
great
many
centuries
since
there
flourished
in
great
state
the
famous
and
renowned
lud
hudibras
king
of
britain
he
was
a
mighty
monarch
the
earth
shook
when
he
walked
he
was
so
very
stout
his
people
basked
in
the
light
of
his
countenance
it
was
so
red
and
glowing
he
was
indeed
every
inch
a
king
and
there
were
a
good
many
inches
of
him
too
for
although
he
was
not
very
tall
he
was
a
remarkable
size
round
and
the
inches
that
he
wanted
in
height
he
made
up
in
circumference
if
any
degenerate
monarch
of
modern
times
could
be
in
any
way
compared
with
him
i
should
say
the
venerable
king
cole
would
be
that
illustrious
potentate
this
good
king
had
a
queen
who
eighteen
years
before
had
had
a
son
who
was
called
bladud
he
was
sent
to
a
preparatory
seminary
in
his
father
s
dominions
until
he
was
ten
years
old
and
was
then
despatched
in
charge
of
a
trusty
messenger
to
a
finishing
school
at
athens
and
as
there
was
no
extra
charge
for
remaining
during
the
holidays
and
no
notice
required
previous
to
the
removal
of
a
pupil
there
he
remained
for
eight
long
years
at
the
expiration
of
which
time
the
king
his
father
sent
the
lord
chamberlain
over
to
settle
the
bill
and
to
bring
him
home
which
the
lord
chamberlain
doing
was
received
with
shouts
and
pensioned
immediately
when
king
lud
saw
the
prince
his
son
and
found
he
had
grown
up
such
a
fine
young
man
he
perceived
what
a
grand
thing
it
would
be
to
have
him
married
without
delay
so
that
his
children
might
be
the
means
of
perpetuating
the
glorious
race
of
lud
down
to
the
very
latest
ages
of
the
world
with
this
view
he
sent
a
special
embassy
composed
of
great
noblemen
who
had
nothing
particular
to
do
and
wanted
lucrative
employment
to
a
neighbouring
king
and
demanded
his
fair
daughter
in
marriage
for
his
son
stating
at
the
same
time
that
he
was
anxious
to
be
on
the
most
affectionate
terms
with
his
brother
and
friend
but
that
if
they
couldn
t
agree
in
arranging
this
marriage
he
should
be
under
the
unpleasant
necessity
of
invading
his
kingdom
and
putting
his
eyes
out
to
this
the
other
king
who
was
the
weaker
of
the
two
replied
that
he
was
very
much
obliged
to
his
friend
and
brother
for
all
his
goodness
and
magnanimity
and
that
his
daughter
was
quite
ready
to
be
married
whenever
prince
bladud
liked
to
come
and
fetch
her
this
answer
no
sooner
reached
britain
than
the
whole
nation
was
transported
with
joy
nothing
was
heard
on
all
sides
but
the
sounds
of
feasting
and
revelry
except
the
chinking
of
money
as
it
was
paid
in
by
the
people
to
the
collector
of
the
royal
treasures
to
defray
the
expenses
of
the
happy
ceremony
it
was
upon
this
occasion
that
king
lud
seated
on
the
top
of
his
throne
in
full
council
rose
in
the
exuberance
of
his
feelings
and
commanded
the
lord
chief
justice
to
order
in
the
richest
wines
and
the
court
minstrels
an
act
of
graciousness
which
has
been
through
the
ignorance
of
traditionary
historians
attributed
to
king
cole
in
those
celebrated
lines
in
which
his
majesty
is
represented
as
calling
for
his
pipe
and
calling
for
his
pot
and
calling
for
his
fiddlers
three
which
is
an
obvious
injustice
to
the
memory
of
king
lud
and
a
dishonest
exaltation
of
the
virtues
of
king
cole
but
in
the
midst
of
all
this
festivity
and
rejoicing
there
was
one
individual
present
who
tasted
not
when
the
sparkling
wines
were
poured
forth
and
who
danced
not
when
the
minstrels
played
this
was
no
other
than
prince
bladud
himself
in
honour
of
whose
happiness
a
whole
people
were
at
that
very
moment
straining
alike
their
throats
and
strings
the
truth
was
that
the
prince
forgetting
the
undoubted
right
of
the
minister
for
foreign
affairs
to
fall
in
love
on
his
behalf
had
contrary
to
every
precedent
of
policy
and
diplomacy
already
fallen
in
love
on
his
own
account
and
privately
contracted
himself
unto
the
fair
daughter
of
a
noble
athenian
here
we
have
a
striking
example
of
one
of
the
manifold
advantages
of
civilisation
and
refinement
if
the
prince
had
lived
in
later
days
he
might
at
once
have
married
the
object
of
his
father
s
choice
and
then
set
himself
seriously
to
work
to
relieve
himself
of
the
burden
which
rested
heavily
upon
him
he
might
have
endeavoured
to
break
her
heart
by
a
systematic
course
of
insult
and
neglect
or
if
the
spirit
of
her
sex
and
a
proud
consciousness
of
her
many
wrongs
had
upheld
her
under
this
he
might
have
sought
to
take
her
life
and
so
get
rid
of
her
effectually
but
neither
mode
of
relief
suggested
itself
to
prince
bladud
so
he
solicited
a
private
audience
and
told
his
father
it
is
an
old
prerogative
of
kings
to
govern
everything
but
their
passions
king
lud
flew
into
a
frightful
rage
tossed
his
crown
up
to
the
ceiling
and
caught
it
again
for
in
those
days
kings
kept
their
crowns
on
their
heads
and
not
in
the
tower
stamped
the
ground
rapped
his
forehead
wondered
why
his
own
flesh
and
blood
rebelled
against
him
and
finally
calling
in
his
guards
ordered
the
prince
away
to
instant
confinement
in
a
lofty
turret
a
course
of
treatment
which
the
kings
of
old
very
generally
pursued
towards
their
sons
when
their
matrimonial
inclinations
did
not
happen
to
point
to
the
same
quarter
as
their
own
when
prince
bladud
had
been
shut
up
in
the
lofty
turret
for
the
greater
part
of
a
year
with
no
better
prospect
before
his
bodily
eyes
than
a
stone
wall
or
before
his
mental
vision
than
prolonged
imprisonment
he
naturally
began
to
ruminate
on
a
plan
of
escape
which
after
months
of
preparation
he
managed
to
accomplish
considerately
leaving
his
knife
in
the
heart
of
his
jailer
lest
the
poor
fellow
who
had
a
family
should
be
considered
privy
to
his
flight
and
punished
accordingly
by
the
infuriated
king
the
monarch
was
frantic
at
the
loss
of
his
son
he
knew
not
on
whom
to
vent
his
grief
and
wrath
until
fortunately
bethinking
himself
of
the
lord
chamberlain
who
had
brought
him
home
he
struck
off
his
pension
and
his
head
together
meanwhile
the
young
prince
effectually
disguised
wandered
on
foot
through
his
father
s
dominions
cheered
and
supported
in
all
his
hardships
by
sweet
thoughts
of
the
athenian
maid
who
was
the
innocent
cause
of
his
weary
trials
one
day
he
stopped
to
rest
in
a
country
village
and
seeing
that
there
were
gay
dances
going
forward
on
the
green
and
gay
faces
passing
to
and
fro
ventured
to
inquire
of
a
reveller
who
stood
near
him
the
reason
for
this
rejoicing
know
you
not
o
stranger
was
the
reply
of
the
recent
proclamation
of
our
gracious
king
proclamation
no
what
proclamation
rejoined
the
prince
for
he
had
travelled
along
the
by
and
ways
and
knew
nothing
of
what
had
passed
upon
the
public
roads
such
as
they
were
why
replied
the
peasant
the
foreign
lady
that
our
prince
wished
to
wed
is
married
to
a
foreign
noble
of
her
own
country
and
the
king
proclaims
the
fact
and
a
great
public
festival
besides
for
now
of
course
prince
bladud
will
come
back
and
marry
the
lady
his
father
chose
who
they
say
is
as
beautiful
as
the
noonday
sun
your
health
sir
god
save
the
king
the
prince
remained
to
hear
no
more
he
fled
from
the
spot
and
plunged
into
the
thickest
recesses
of
a
neighbouring
wood
on
on
he
wandered
night
and
day
beneath
the
blazing
sun
and
the
cold
pale
moon
through
the
dry
heat
of
noon
and
the
damp
cold
of
night
in
the
gray
light
of
morn
and
the
red
glare
of
eve
so
heedless
was
he
of
time
or
object
that
being
bound
for
athens
he
wandered
as
far
out
of
his
way
as
bath
there
was
no
city
where
bath
stands
then
there
was
no
vestige
of
human
habitation
or
sign
of
man
s
resort
to
bear
the
name
but
there
was
the
same
noble
country
the
same
broad
expanse
of
hill
and
dale
the
same
beautiful
channel
stealing
on
far
away
the
same
lofty
mountains
which
like
the
troubles
of
life
viewed
at
a
distance
and
partially
obscured
by
the
bright
mist
of
its
morning
lose
their
ruggedness
and
asperity
and
seem
all
ease
and
softness
moved
by
the
gentle
beauty
of
the
scene
the
prince
sank
upon
the
green
turf
and
bathed
his
swollen
feet
in
his
tears
oh
said
the
unhappy
bladud
clasping
his
hands
and
mournfully
raising
his
eyes
towards
the
sky
would
that
my
wanderings
might
end
here
would
that
these
grateful
tears
with
which
i
now
mourn
hope
misplaced
and
love
despised
might
flow
in
peace
for
ever
the
wish
was
heard
it
was
in
the
time
of
the
heathen
deities
who
used
occasionally
to
take
people
at
their
words
with
a
promptness
in
some
cases
extremely
awkward
the
ground
opened
beneath
the
prince
s
feet
he
sank
into
the
chasm
and
instantaneously
it
closed
upon
his
head
for
ever
save
where
his
hot
tears
welled
up
through
the
earth
and
where
they
have
continued
to
gush
forth
ever
since
it
is
observable
that
to
this
day
large
numbers
of
elderly
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
have
been
disappointed
in
procuring
partners
and
almost
as
many
young
ones
who
are
anxious
to
obtain
them
repair
annually
to
bath
to
drink
the
waters
from
which
they
derive
much
strength
and
comfort
this
is
most
complimentary
to
the
virtue
of
prince
bladud
s
tears
and
strongly
corroborative
of
the
veracity
of
this
pickwick
yawned
several
times
when
he
had
arrived
at
the
end
of
this
little
manuscript
carefully
refolded
and
replaced
it
in
the
inkstand
drawer
and
then
with
a
countenance
expressive
of
the
utmost
weariness
lighted
his
chamber
candle
and
went
upstairs
to
bed
he
stopped
at
dowler
s
door
according
to
custom
and
knocked
to
say
ah
said
dowler
going
to
bed
i
wish
i
was
dismal
night
windy
isn
t
it
very
said
pickwick
pickwick
went
to
his
bedchamber
and
dowler
resumed
his
seat
before
the
fire
in
fulfilment
of
his
rash
promise
to
sit
up
till
his
wife
came
home
there
are
few
things
more
worrying
than
sitting
up
for
somebody
especially
if
that
somebody
be
at
a
party
you
can
not
help
thinking
how
quickly
the
time
passes
with
them
which
drags
so
heavily
with
you
and
the
more
you
think
of
this
the
more
your
hopes
of
their
speedy
arrival
decline
clocks
tick
so
loud
too
when
you
are
sitting
up
alone
and
you
seem
as
if
you
had
an
of
cobwebs
on
first
something
tickles
your
right
knee
and
then
the
same
sensation
irritates
your
left
you
have
no
sooner
changed
your
position
than
it
comes
again
in
the
arms
when
you
have
fidgeted
your
limbs
into
all
sorts
of
queer
shapes
you
have
a
sudden
relapse
in
the
nose
which
you
rub
as
if
to
rub
it
off
as
there
is
no
doubt
you
would
if
you
could
eyes
too
are
mere
personal
inconveniences
and
the
wick
of
one
candle
gets
an
inch
and
a
half
long
while
you
are
snuffing
the
other
these
and
various
other
little
nervous
annoyances
render
sitting
up
for
a
length
of
time
after
everybody
else
has
gone
to
bed
anything
but
a
cheerful
amusement
this
was
just
dowler
s
opinion
as
he
sat
before
the
fire
and
felt
honestly
indignant
with
all
the
inhuman
people
at
the
party
who
were
keeping
him
up
he
was
not
put
into
better
humour
either
by
the
reflection
that
he
had
taken
it
into
his
head
early
in
the
evening
to
think
he
had
got
an
ache
there
and
so
stopped
at
home
at
length
after
several
droppings
asleep
and
fallings
forward
towards
the
bars
and
catchings
backward
soon
enough
to
prevent
being
branded
in
the
face
dowler
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
throw
himself
on
the
bed
in
the
back
room
and
think
not
sleep
of
course
i
m
a
heavy
sleeper
said
dowler
as
he
flung
himself
on
the
bed
i
must
keep
awake
i
suppose
i
shall
hear
a
knock
here
yes
i
thought
so
i
can
hear
the
watchman
there
he
goes
fainter
now
though
a
little
fainter
he
s
turning
the
corner
ah
when
dowler
arrived
at
this
point
he
turned
the
corner
at
which
he
had
been
long
hesitating
and
fell
fast
asleep
just
as
the
clock
struck
three
there
was
blown
into
the
crescent
a
with
dowler
inside
borne
by
one
short
fat
chairman
and
one
long
thin
one
who
had
had
much
ado
to
keep
their
bodies
perpendicular
to
say
nothing
of
the
chair
but
on
that
high
ground
and
in
the
crescent
which
the
wind
swept
round
and
round
as
if
it
were
going
to
tear
the
paving
stones
up
its
fury
was
tremendous
they
were
very
glad
to
set
the
chair
down
and
give
a
good
round
loud
at
the
street
door
they
waited
some
time
but
nobody
came
servants
is
in
the
arms
o
porpus
i
think
said
the
short
chairman
warming
his
hands
at
the
attendant
s
torch
i
wish
he
d
give
em
a
squeeze
and
wake
em
observed
the
long
one
knock
again
will
you
if
you
please
cried
dowler
from
the
chair
knock
two
or
three
times
if
you
the
short
man
was
quite
willing
to
get
the
job
over
as
soon
as
possible
so
he
stood
on
the
step
and
gave
four
or
five
most
startling
of
eight
or
ten
knocks
while
the
long
man
went
into
the
road
and
looked
up
at
the
windows
for
a
light
nobody
came
it
was
all
as
silent
and
dark
as
ever
dear
me
said
dowler
you
must
knock
again
if
you
there
ain
t
a
bell
is
there
ma
am
said
the
short
chairman
yes
there
is
interposed
the
i
ve
been
at
it
ever
so
it
s
only
a
handle
said
dowler
the
wire
s
i
wish
the
servants
heads
wos
growled
the
long
man
i
must
trouble
you
to
knock
again
if
you
please
said
dowler
with
the
utmost
politeness
the
short
man
did
knock
again
several
times
without
producing
the
smallest
effect
the
tall
man
growing
very
impatient
then
relieved
him
and
kept
on
perpetually
knocking
of
two
loud
knocks
each
like
an
insane
postman
at
length
winkle
began
to
dream
that
he
was
at
a
club
and
that
the
members
being
very
refractory
the
chairman
was
obliged
to
hammer
the
table
a
good
deal
to
preserve
order
then
he
had
a
confused
notion
of
an
auction
room
where
there
were
no
bidders
and
the
auctioneer
was
buying
everything
in
and
ultimately
he
began
to
think
it
just
within
the
bounds
of
possibility
that
somebody
might
be
knocking
at
the
street
door
to
make
quite
certain
however
he
remained
quiet
in
bed
for
ten
minutes
or
so
and
listened
and
when
he
had
counted
two
or
thirty
knocks
he
felt
quite
satisfied
and
gave
himself
a
great
deal
of
credit
for
being
so
wakeful
rap
ra
ra
ra
ra
rap
went
the
knocker
winkle
jumped
out
of
bed
wondering
very
much
what
could
possibly
be
the
matter
and
hastily
putting
on
his
stockings
and
slippers
folded
his
round
him
lighted
a
flat
candle
from
the
that
was
burning
in
the
fireplace
and
hurried
downstairs
here
s
somebody
comin
at
last
ma
am
said
the
short
chairman
i
wish
i
wos
behind
him
vith
a
bradawl
muttered
the
long
one
who
s
there
cried
winkle
undoing
the
chain
don
t
stop
to
ask
questions
head
replied
the
long
man
with
great
disgust
taking
it
for
granted
that
the
inquirer
was
a
footman
but
open
the
come
look
sharp
timber
eyelids
added
the
other
encouragingly
winkle
being
half
asleep
obeyed
the
command
mechanically
opened
the
door
a
little
and
peeped
out
the
first
thing
he
saw
was
the
red
glare
of
the
s
torch
startled
by
the
sudden
fear
that
the
house
might
be
on
fire
he
hastily
threw
the
door
wide
open
and
holding
the
candle
above
his
head
stared
eagerly
before
him
not
quite
certain
whether
what
he
saw
was
a
or
a
at
this
instant
there
came
a
violent
gust
of
wind
the
light
was
blown
out
winkle
felt
himself
irresistibly
impelled
on
to
the
steps
and
the
door
blew
to
with
a
loud
crash
well
young
man
now
you
it
said
the
short
chairman
winkle
catching
sight
of
a
lady
s
face
at
the
window
of
the
sedan
turned
hastily
round
plied
the
knocker
with
all
his
might
and
main
and
called
frantically
upon
the
chairman
to
take
the
chair
away
again
take
it
away
take
it
away
cried
winkle
here
s
somebody
coming
out
of
another
house
put
me
into
the
chair
hide
me
do
something
with
me
all
this
time
he
was
shivering
with
cold
and
every
time
he
raised
his
hand
to
the
knocker
the
wind
took
the
in
a
most
unpleasant
manner
the
people
are
coming
down
the
crescent
now
there
are
ladies
with
em
cover
me
up
with
something
stand
before
me
roared
winkle
but
the
chairmen
were
too
much
exhausted
with
laughing
to
afford
him
the
slightest
assistance
and
the
ladies
were
every
moment
approaching
nearer
and
nearer
winkle
gave
a
last
hopeless
knock
the
ladies
were
only
a
few
doors
off
he
threw
away
the
extinguished
candle
which
all
this
time
he
had
held
above
his
head
and
fairly
bolted
into
the
where
dowler
was
now
craddock
had
heard
the
knocking
and
the
voices
at
last
and
only
waiting
to
put
something
smarter
on
her
head
than
her
nightcap
ran
down
into
the
front
to
make
sure
that
it
was
the
right
party
throwing
up
the
as
winkle
was
rushing
into
the
chair
she
no
sooner
caught
sight
of
what
was
going
forward
below
than
she
raised
a
vehement
and
dismal
shriek
and
implored
dowler
to
get
up
directly
for
his
wife
was
running
away
with
another
gentleman
upon
this
dowler
bounced
off
the
bed
as
abruptly
as
an
ball
and
rushing
into
the
front
room
arrived
at
one
window
just
as
pickwick
threw
up
the
other
when
the
first
object
that
met
the
gaze
of
both
was
winkle
bolting
into
the
watchman
shouted
dowler
furiously
stop
him
hold
him
keep
him
tight
shut
him
in
till
i
come
down
i
ll
cut
his
throat
give
me
a
knife
from
ear
to
ear
craddock
i
will
and
breaking
from
the
shrieking
landlady
and
from
pickwick
the
indignant
husband
seized
a
small
and
tore
into
the
street
but
winkle
didn
t
wait
for
him
he
no
sooner
heard
the
horrible
threat
of
the
valorous
dowler
than
he
bounced
out
of
the
sedan
quite
as
quickly
as
he
had
bounced
in
and
throwing
off
his
slippers
into
the
road
took
to
his
heels
and
tore
round
the
crescent
hotly
pursued
by
dowler
and
the
watchman
he
kept
ahead
the
door
was
open
as
he
came
round
the
second
time
he
rushed
in
slammed
it
in
dowler
s
face
mounted
to
his
bedroom
locked
the
door
piled
a
chest
of
drawers
and
a
table
against
it
and
packed
up
a
few
necessaries
ready
for
flight
with
the
first
ray
of
morning
dowler
came
up
to
the
outside
of
the
door
avowed
through
the
keyhole
his
steadfast
determination
of
cutting
winkle
s
throat
next
day
and
after
a
great
confusion
of
voices
in
the
amidst
which
that
of
pickwick
was
distinctly
heard
endeavouring
to
make
peace
the
inmates
dispersed
to
their
several
and
all
was
quiet
once
more
it
is
not
unlikely
that
the
inquiry
may
be
made
where
weller
was
all
this
time
we
will
state
where
he
was
in
the
next
chapter
chapter
xxxvii
honourably
accounts
for
weller
s
absence
by
describing
a
soiree
to
which
he
was
invited
and
went
also
relates
how
he
was
entrusted
by
pickwick
with
a
private
mission
of
delicacy
and
importance
weller
said
craddock
upon
the
morning
of
this
very
eventful
day
here
s
a
letter
for
wery
odd
that
said
sam
i
m
afeerd
there
must
be
somethin
the
matter
for
i
don
t
recollect
any
gen
l
m
n
in
my
circle
of
acquaintance
as
is
capable
o
writin
perhaps
something
uncommon
has
taken
place
observed
craddock
it
must
be
somethin
wery
uncommon
indeed
as
could
perduce
a
letter
out
o
any
friend
o
mine
replied
sam
shaking
his
head
dubiously
nothin
less
than
a
nat
ral
conwulsion
as
the
young
gen
l
m
n
observed
ven
he
wos
took
with
fits
it
can
t
be
from
the
gov
ner
said
sam
looking
at
the
direction
he
always
prints
i
know
cos
he
learnt
writin
from
the
large
bills
in
the
it
s
a
wery
strange
thing
now
where
this
here
letter
can
ha
come
as
sam
said
this
he
did
what
a
great
many
people
do
when
they
are
uncertain
about
the
writer
of
a
note
looked
at
the
seal
and
then
at
the
front
and
then
at
the
back
and
then
at
the
sides
and
then
at
the
superscription
and
as
a
last
resource
thought
perhaps
he
might
as
well
look
at
the
inside
and
try
to
find
out
from
that
it
s
wrote
on
paper
said
sam
as
he
unfolded
it
and
sealed
in
bronze
vax
vith
the
top
of
a
door
key
now
for
and
with
a
very
grave
face
weller
slowly
read
as
follows
a
select
company
of
the
bath
footmen
presents
their
compliments
to
weller
and
requests
the
pleasure
of
his
company
this
evening
to
a
friendly
swarry
consisting
of
a
boiled
leg
of
mutton
with
the
usual
trimmings
the
swarry
to
be
on
table
at
nine
o
clock
this
was
inclosed
in
another
note
which
ran
thus
mr
john
smauker
the
gentleman
who
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
weller
at
the
house
of
their
mutual
acquaintance
bantam
a
few
days
since
begs
to
inclose
weller
the
herewith
invitation
if
weller
will
call
on
john
smauker
at
nine
o
clock
john
smauker
will
have
the
pleasure
of
introducing
weller
signed
the
envelope
was
directed
to
blank
weller
at
pickwick
s
and
in
a
parenthesis
in
the
left
hand
corner
were
the
words
airy
bell
as
an
instruction
to
the
bearer
vell
said
sam
this
is
comin
it
rayther
powerful
this
is
i
never
heerd
a
biled
leg
o
mutton
called
a
swarry
afore
i
wonder
wot
they
d
call
a
roast
however
without
waiting
to
debate
the
point
sam
at
once
betook
himself
into
the
presence
of
pickwick
and
requested
leave
of
absence
for
that
evening
which
was
readily
granted
with
this
permission
and
the
key
sam
weller
issued
forth
a
little
before
the
appointed
time
and
strolled
leisurely
towards
queen
square
which
he
no
sooner
gained
than
he
had
the
satisfaction
of
beholding
john
smauker
leaning
his
powdered
head
against
a
at
a
short
distance
off
smoking
a
cigar
through
an
amber
tube
how
do
you
do
weller
said
john
smauker
raising
his
hat
gracefully
with
one
hand
while
he
gently
waved
the
other
in
a
condescending
manner
how
do
you
do
sir
why
reasonably
conwalessent
replied
sam
how
do
yourself
my
dear
feller
only
so
so
said
john
smauker
ah
you
ve
been
too
hard
observed
sam
i
was
fearful
you
would
it
won
t
do
you
know
you
must
not
give
way
to
that
ere
uncompromisin
spirit
o
it
s
not
so
much
that
weller
replied
john
smauker
as
bad
wine
i
m
afraid
i
ve
been
oh
that
s
it
is
it
said
sam
that
s
a
wery
bad
complaint
and
yet
the
temptation
you
see
weller
observed
john
smauker
ah
to
be
sure
said
sam
plunged
into
the
very
vortex
of
society
you
know
weller
said
john
smauker
with
a
sigh
dreadful
indeed
rejoined
sam
but
it
s
always
the
way
said
john
smauker
if
your
destiny
leads
you
into
public
life
and
public
station
you
must
expect
to
be
subjected
to
temptations
which
other
people
is
free
from
precisely
what
my
uncle
said
ven
he
vent
into
the
public
line
remarked
sam
and
wery
right
the
old
gen
l
m
n
wos
for
he
drank
hisself
to
death
in
somethin
less
than
a
john
smauker
looked
deeply
indignant
at
any
parallel
being
drawn
between
himself
and
the
deceased
gentleman
in
question
but
as
sam
s
face
was
in
the
most
immovable
state
of
calmness
he
thought
better
of
it
and
looked
affable
again
perhaps
we
had
better
be
walking
said
smauker
consulting
a
copper
timepiece
which
dwelt
at
the
bottom
of
a
deep
and
was
raised
to
the
surface
by
means
of
a
black
string
with
a
copper
key
at
the
other
end
p
raps
we
had
replied
sam
or
they
ll
overdo
the
swarry
and
that
ll
spile
have
you
drank
the
waters
weller
inquired
his
companion
as
they
walked
towards
high
street
once
replied
sam
what
did
you
think
of
em
sir
i
thought
they
was
particklery
unpleasant
replied
sam
ah
said
john
smauker
you
disliked
the
killibeate
taste
perhaps
i
don
t
know
much
about
that
ere
said
sam
i
thought
they
d
a
wery
strong
flavour
o
warm
flat
that
the
killibeate
weller
observed
john
smauker
contemptuously
well
if
it
is
it
s
a
wery
inexpressive
word
that
s
all
said
sam
it
may
be
but
i
ain
t
much
in
the
chimical
line
myself
so
i
can
t
and
here
to
the
great
horror
of
john
smauker
sam
weller
began
to
whistle
i
beg
your
pardon
weller
said
john
smauker
agonised
at
the
exceeding
ungenteel
sound
will
you
take
my
arm
thank
ee
you
re
wery
good
but
i
won
t
deprive
you
of
it
replied
sam
i
ve
rayther
a
way
o
putting
my
hands
in
my
pockets
if
it
s
all
the
same
to
as
sam
said
this
he
suited
the
action
to
the
word
and
whistled
far
louder
than
before
this
way
said
his
new
friend
apparently
much
relieved
as
they
turned
down
a
we
shall
soon
be
shall
we
said
sam
quite
unmoved
by
the
announcement
of
his
close
vicinity
to
the
select
footmen
of
bath
yes
said
john
smauker
don
t
be
alarmed
oh
no
said
sam
you
ll
see
some
very
handsome
uniforms
weller
continued
john
smauker
and
perhaps
you
ll
find
some
of
the
gentlemen
rather
high
at
first
you
know
but
they
ll
soon
come
that
s
wery
kind
on
em
replied
sam
and
you
know
resumed
john
smauker
with
an
air
of
sublime
protection
you
know
as
you
re
a
stranger
perhaps
they
ll
be
rather
hard
upon
you
at
they
won
t
be
wery
cruel
though
will
they
inquired
sam
no
no
replied
john
smauker
pulling
forth
the
fox
s
head
and
taking
a
gentlemanly
pinch
there
are
some
funny
dogs
among
us
and
they
will
have
their
joke
you
know
but
you
mustn
t
mind
em
you
mustn
t
mind
i
ll
try
and
bear
up
agin
such
a
reg
lar
knock
down
o
talent
replied
sam
that
s
right
said
john
smauker
putting
forth
his
fox
s
head
and
elevating
his
own
i
ll
stand
by
by
this
time
they
had
reached
a
small
greengrocer
s
shop
which
john
smauker
entered
followed
by
sam
who
the
moment
he
got
behind
him
relapsed
into
a
series
of
the
very
broadest
and
most
unmitigated
grins
and
manifested
other
demonstrations
of
being
in
a
highly
enviable
state
of
inward
merriment
crossing
the
greengrocer
s
shop
and
putting
their
hats
on
the
stairs
in
the
little
passage
behind
it
they
walked
into
a
small
parlour
and
here
the
full
splendour
of
the
scene
burst
upon
weller
s
view
a
couple
of
tables
were
put
together
in
the
middle
of
the
parlour
covered
with
three
or
four
cloths
of
different
ages
and
dates
of
washing
arranged
to
look
as
much
like
one
as
the
circumstances
of
the
case
would
allow
upon
these
were
laid
knives
and
forks
for
six
or
eight
people
some
of
the
knife
handles
were
green
others
red
and
a
few
yellow
and
as
all
the
forks
were
black
the
combination
of
colours
was
exceedingly
striking
plates
for
a
corresponding
number
of
guests
were
warming
behind
the
fender
and
the
guests
themselves
were
warming
before
it
the
chief
and
most
important
of
whom
appeared
to
be
a
stoutish
gentleman
in
a
bright
crimson
coat
with
long
tails
vividly
red
breeches
and
a
cocked
hat
who
was
standing
with
his
back
to
the
fire
and
had
apparently
just
entered
for
besides
retaining
his
cocked
hat
on
his
head
he
carried
in
his
hand
a
high
stick
such
as
gentlemen
of
his
profession
usually
elevate
in
a
sloping
position
over
the
roofs
of
carriages
smauker
my
lad
your
fin
said
the
gentleman
with
the
cocked
hat
smauker
dovetailed
the
top
joint
of
his
little
finger
into
that
of
the
gentleman
with
the
cocked
hat
and
said
he
was
charmed
to
see
him
looking
so
well
well
they
tell
me
i
am
looking
pretty
blooming
said
the
man
with
the
cocked
hat
and
it
s
a
wonder
too
i
ve
been
following
our
old
woman
about
two
hours
a
day
for
the
last
fortnight
and
if
a
constant
contemplation
of
the
manner
in
which
she
that
infernal
old
gown
of
hers
behind
isn
t
enough
to
throw
anybody
into
a
low
state
of
despondency
for
life
stop
my
quarter
s
at
this
the
assembled
selections
laughed
very
heartily
and
one
gentleman
in
a
yellow
waistcoat
with
a
border
whispered
a
neighbour
in
smalls
that
tuckle
was
in
spirits
by
the
bye
said
tuckle
smauker
my
boy
you
the
remainder
of
the
sentence
was
forwarded
into
john
smauker
s
ear
by
whisper
oh
dear
me
i
quite
forgot
said
john
smauker
gentlemen
my
friend
sorry
to
keep
the
fire
off
you
weller
said
tuckle
with
a
familiar
nod
hope
you
re
not
cold

by
no
means
blazes
replied
sam
it
ud
be
a
wery
chilly
subject
as
felt
cold
wen
you
stood
opposite
you
d
save
coals
if
they
put
you
behind
the
fender
in
the
waitin
at
a
public
office
you
as
this
retort
appeared
to
convey
rather
a
personal
allusion
to
tuckle
s
crimson
livery
that
gentleman
looked
majestic
for
a
few
seconds
but
gradually
edging
away
from
the
fire
broke
into
a
forced
smile
and
said
it
wasn
t
bad
wery
much
obliged
for
your
good
opinion
sir
replied
sam
we
shall
get
on
by
degrees
i
we
ll
try
a
better
one
by
and
at
this
point
the
conversation
was
interrupted
by
the
arrival
of
a
gentleman
in
plush
accompanied
by
another
selection
in
purple
cloth
with
a
great
extent
of
stocking
the
having
been
welcomed
by
the
old
ones
tuckle
put
the
question
that
supper
be
ordered
in
which
was
carried
unanimously
the
greengrocer
and
his
wife
then
arranged
upon
the
table
a
boiled
leg
of
mutton
hot
with
caper
sauce
turnips
and
potatoes
tuckle
took
the
chair
and
was
supported
at
the
other
end
of
the
board
by
the
gentleman
in
orange
plush
the
greengrocer
put
on
a
pair
of
gloves
to
hand
the
plates
with
and
stationed
himself
behind
tuckle
s
chair
harris
said
tuckle
in
a
commanding
tone
sir
said
the
greengrocer
have
you
got
your
gloves
on
yes
then
take
the
kiver
yes
the
greengrocer
did
as
he
was
told
with
a
show
of
great
humility
and
obsequiously
handed
tuckle
the
in
doing
which
he
accidentally
gaped
what
do
you
mean
by
that
sir
said
tuckle
with
great
asperity
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
replied
the
crestfallen
greengrocer
i
didn
t
mean
to
do
it
sir
i
was
up
very
late
last
night
i
tell
you
what
my
opinion
of
you
is
harris
said
tuckle
with
a
most
impressive
air
you

a
wulgar
i
hope

said
harris
that
you
won
t
be
severe
with
me
gentlemen
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
indeed
gentlemen
for
your
patronage
and
also
for
your
recommendations
gentlemen
whenever
additional
assistance
in
waiting
is
required
i
hope
gentlemen
i
give
no
you
don
t
sir
said
tuckle
very
far
from
it
we
consider
you
an
inattentive
reskel
said
the
gentleman
in
the
orange
plush
and
a
low
thief
added
the
gentleman
in
the
smalls
and
an
unreclaimable
blaygaird
added
the
gentleman
in
purple
the
poor
greengrocer
bowed
very
humbly
while
these
little
epithets
were
bestowed
upon
him
in
the
true
spirit
of
the
very
smallest
tyranny
and
when
everybody
had
said
something
to
show
his
superiority
tuckle
proceeded
to
carve
the
leg
of
mutton
and
to
help
the
company
this
important
business
of
the
evening
had
hardly
commenced
when
the
door
was
thrown
briskly
open
and
another
gentleman
in
a
suit
and
leaden
buttons
made
his
appearance
against
the
rules
said
tuckle
too
late
too
no
no
positively
i
couldn
t
help
it
said
the
gentleman
in
blue
i
appeal
to
the
company
an
affair
of
gallantry
now
an
appointment
at
the
oh
that
indeed
said
the
gentleman
in
the
orange
plush
yes
raly
now
honour
bright
said
the
man
in
blue
i
made
a
promese
to
fetch
our
youngest
daughter
at
ten
and
she
is
such
an
uncauminly
fine
gal
that
i
raly
hadn
t
the
art
to
disappint
her
no
offence
to
the
present
company
sir
but
a
petticut
sir
a
petticut
sir
is
i
begin
to
suspect
there
s
something
in
that
quarter
said
tuckle
as
the
took
his
seat
next
sam
i
ve
remarked
once
or
twice
that
she
leans
very
heavy
on
your
shoulder
when
she
gets
in
and
out
of
the
oh
raly
raly
tuckle
you
shouldn
t
said
the
man
in
blue
it
s
not
fair
i
may
have
said
to
one
or
two
friends
that
she
wos
a
very
divine
creechure
and
had
refused
one
or
two
offers
without
any
hobvus
cause
but
no
no
no
indeed
tuckle
before
strangers
too
it
s
not
right
you
shouldn
t
delicacy
my
dear
friend
delicacy
and
the
man
in
blue
pulling
up
his
neckerchief
and
adjusting
his
coat
cuffs
nodded
and
frowned
as
if
there
were
more
behind
which
he
could
say
if
he
liked
but
was
bound
in
honour
to
suppress
the
man
in
blue
being
a
free
and
easy
sort
of
footman
with
a
swaggering
air
and
pert
face
had
attracted
weller
s
special
attention
at
first
but
when
he
began
to
come
out
in
this
way
sam
felt
more
than
ever
disposed
to
cultivate
his
acquaintance
so
he
launched
himself
into
the
conversation
at
once
with
characteristic
independence
your
health
sir
said
sam
i
like
your
conversation
much
i
think
it
s
wery
at
this
the
man
in
blue
smiled
as
if
it
were
a
compliment
he
was
well
used
to
but
looked
approvingly
on
sam
at
the
same
time
and
said
he
hoped
he
should
be
better
acquainted
with
him
for
without
any
flattery
at
all
he
seemed
to
have
the
makings
of
a
very
nice
fellow
about
him
and
to
be
just
the
man
after
his
own
heart
you
re
wery
good
sir
said
sam
what
a
lucky
feller
you
are
how
do
you
mean
inquired
the
gentleman
in
blue
that
ere
young
lady
replied
sam
she
knows
wot
s
wot
she
does
ah
i
weller
closed
one
eye
and
shook
his
head
from
side
to
side
in
a
manner
which
was
highly
gratifying
to
the
personal
vanity
of
the
gentleman
in
blue
i
m
afraid
you
re
a
cunning
fellow
weller
said
that
individual
no
no
said
sam
i
leave
all
that
ere
to
you
it
s
a
great
deal
more
in
your
way
than
mine
as
the
gen
l
m
n
on
the
right
side
o
the
garden
vall
said
to
the
man
on
the
wrong
un
ven
the
mad
bull
vos
comin
up
the
well
well
weller
said
the
gentleman
in
blue
i
think
she
has
remarked
my
air
and
manner
i
should
think
she
couldn
t
wery
well
be
off
o
that
said
sam
have
you
any
little
thing
of
that
kind
in
hand
sir
inquired
the
favoured
gentleman
in
blue
drawing
a
toothpick
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
not
exactly
said
sam
there
s
no
daughters
at
my
place
else
o
course
i
should
ha
made
up
to
vun
on
em
as
it
is
i
don
t
think
i
can
do
with
anythin
under
a
female
markis
i
might
keep
up
with
a
young
ooman
o
large
property
as
hadn
t
a
title
if
she
made
wery
fierce
love
to
me
not
of
course
not
weller
said
the
gentleman
in
blue
one
can
t
be
troubled
you
know
and
know
weller
we
who
are
men
of
the
world
that
a
good
uniform
must
work
its
way
with
the
women
sooner
or
later
in
fact
that
s
the
only
thing
between
you
and
me
that
makes
the
service
worth
entering
just
so
said
sam
that
s
it
o
when
this
confidential
dialogue
had
gone
thus
far
glasses
were
placed
round
and
every
gentleman
ordered
what
he
liked
best
before
the
shut
up
the
gentleman
in
blue
and
the
man
in
orange
who
were
the
chief
exquisites
of
the
party
ordered
cold
shrub
and
water
but
with
the
others
sweet
appeared
to
be
the
favourite
beverage
sam
called
the
greengrocer
a
desp
rate
willin
and
ordered
a
large
bowl
of
punch
two
circumstances
which
seemed
to
raise
him
very
much
in
the
opinion
of
the
selections
gentlemen
said
the
man
in
blue
with
an
air
of
the
most
consummate
dandyism
i
ll
give
you
the
ladies
hear
hear
said
sam
the
young
here
there
was
a
loud
cry
of
order
and
john
smauker
as
the
gentleman
who
had
introduced
weller
into
that
company
begged
to
inform
him
that
the
word
he
had
just
made
use
of
was
unparliamentary
which
word
was
that
ere
sir
inquired
sam
mississes
sir
replied
john
smauker
with
an
alarming
frown
we
don
t
recognise
such
distinctions
oh
wery
good
said
sam
then
i
ll
amend
the
obserwation
and
call
em
the
dear
creeturs
if
blazes
vill
allow
some
doubt
appeared
to
exist
in
the
mind
of
the
gentleman
in
the
foil
smalls
whether
the
chairman
could
be
legally
appealed
to
as
blazes
but
as
the
company
seemed
more
disposed
to
stand
upon
their
own
rights
than
his
the
question
was
not
raised
the
man
with
the
cocked
hat
breathed
short
and
looked
long
at
sam
but
apparently
thought
it
as
well
to
say
nothing
in
case
he
should
get
the
worst
of
it
after
a
short
silence
a
gentleman
in
an
embroidered
coat
reaching
down
to
his
heels
and
a
waistcoat
of
the
same
which
kept
one
half
of
his
legs
warm
stirred
his
with
great
energy
and
putting
himself
upon
his
feet
all
at
once
by
a
violent
effort
said
he
was
desirous
of
offering
a
few
remarks
to
the
company
whereupon
the
person
in
the
cocked
hat
had
no
doubt
that
the
company
would
be
very
happy
to
hear
any
remarks
that
the
man
in
the
long
coat
might
wish
to
offer
i
feel
a
great
delicacy
gentlemen
in
coming
for
ard
said
the
man
in
the
long
coat
having
the
misforchune
to
be
a
coachman
and
being
only
admitted
as
a
honorary
member
of
these
agreeable
swarrys
but
i
do
feel
myself
bound
gentlemen
drove
into
a
corner
if
i
may
use
the
expression
to
make
known
an
afflicting
circumstance
which
has
come
to
my
knowledge
which
has
happened
i
may
say
within
the
soap
of
my
everyday
contemplation
gentlemen
our
friend
whiffers
everybody
looked
at
the
individual
in
orange
our
friend
whiffers
has
universal
astonishment
fell
upon
the
hearers
each
gentleman
looked
in
his
neighbour
s
face
and
then
transferred
his
glance
to
the
upstanding
coachman
you
may
well
be
sapparised
gentlemen
said
the
coachman
i
will
not
wenchure
to
state
the
reasons
of
this
irrepairabel
loss
to
the
service
but
i
will
beg
whiffers
to
state
them
himself
for
the
improvement
and
imitation
of
his
admiring
the
suggestion
being
loudly
approved
of
whiffers
explained
he
said
he
certainly
could
have
wished
to
have
continued
to
hold
the
appointment
he
had
just
resigned
the
uniform
was
extremely
rich
and
expensive
the
females
of
the
family
was
most
agreeable
and
the
duties
of
the
situation
was
not
he
was
bound
to
say
too
heavy
the
principal
service
that
was
required
of
him
being
that
he
should
look
out
of
the
hall
window
as
much
as
possible
in
company
with
another
gentleman
who
had
also
resigned
he
could
have
wished
to
have
spared
that
company
the
painful
and
disgusting
detail
on
which
he
was
about
to
enter
but
as
the
explanation
had
been
demanded
of
him
he
had
no
alternative
but
to
state
boldly
and
distinctly
that
he
had
been
required
to
eat
cold
meat
it
is
impossible
to
conceive
the
disgust
which
this
avowal
awakened
in
the
bosoms
of
the
hearers
loud
cries
of
shame
mingled
with
groans
and
hisses
prevailed
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
whiffers
then
added
that
he
feared
a
portion
of
this
outrage
might
be
traced
to
his
own
forbearing
and
accommodating
disposition
he
had
a
distinct
recollection
of
having
once
consented
to
eat
salt
butter
and
he
had
moreover
on
an
occasion
of
sudden
sickness
in
the
house
so
far
forgotten
himself
as
to
carry
a
up
to
the
second
floor
he
trusted
he
had
not
lowered
himself
in
the
good
opinion
of
his
friends
by
this
frank
confession
of
his
faults
and
he
hoped
the
promptness
with
which
he
had
resented
the
last
unmanly
outrage
on
his
feelings
to
which
he
had
referred
would
reinstate
him
in
their
good
opinion
if
he
had
whiffers
s
address
was
responded
to
with
a
shout
of
admiration
and
the
health
of
the
interesting
martyr
was
drunk
in
a
most
enthusiastic
manner
for
this
the
martyr
returned
thanks
and
proposed
their
visitor
weller
a
gentleman
whom
he
had
not
the
pleasure
of
an
intimate
acquaintance
with
but
who
was
the
friend
of
john
smauker
which
was
a
sufficient
letter
of
recommendation
to
any
society
of
gentlemen
whatever
or
wherever
on
this
account
he
should
have
been
disposed
to
have
given
weller
s
health
with
all
the
honours
if
his
friends
had
been
drinking
wine
but
as
they
were
taking
spirits
by
way
of
a
change
and
as
it
might
be
inconvenient
to
empty
a
tumbler
at
every
toast
he
should
propose
that
the
honours
be
understood
at
the
conclusion
of
this
speech
everybody
took
a
sip
in
honour
of
sam
and
sam
having
ladled
out
and
drunk
two
full
glasses
of
punch
in
honour
of
himself
returned
thanks
in
a
neat
speech
wery
much
obliged
to
you
old
fellers
said
sam
ladling
away
at
the
punch
in
the
most
unembarrassed
manner
possible
for
this
here
compliment
which
comin
from
sich
a
quarter
is
wery
overvelmin

heered
a
good
deal
on

and
has
always
made
me

happy
to
look
at
ever
since
i
was
a
boy
about
half
as
high
as
the
stick
o
my
wery
respectable
friend
blazes
there
as
to
the
wictim
of
oppression
in
the
suit
o
brimstone
all
i
can
say
of
him
is
that
i
hope
he

get

as
good
a
berth
as
he
deserves
in

case
it
s
wery
little
cold
swarry
as

be
troubled
with
here
sam
sat
down
with
a
pleasant
smile
and
his
speech
having
been
vociferously
applauded
the
company
broke
up
wy
you
don
t
mean
to
say
you
re
old
feller
said
sam
weller
to
his
friend
john
smauker
i
must
indeed
said
smauker
i
promised
oh
wery
well
said
sam
that
s
another
thing
p
raps
he
d
resign
if
you
disappinted
him
you

yes
i

said
the
man
with
the
cocked
hat
wot
and
leave
of
a
bowl
of
punch
behind
you
said
sam
nonsense
set
down
tuckle
was
not
proof
against
this
invitation
he
laid
aside
the
cocked
hat
and
stick
which
he
had
just
taken
up
and
said
he
would
have
one
glass
for
good
fellowship
s
sake
as
the
gentleman
in
blue
went
home
the
same
way
as
tuckle
he
was
prevailed
upon
to
stop
too
when
the
punch
was
about
half
gone
sam
ordered
in
some
oysters
from
the
s
shop
and
the
effect
of
both
was
so
extremely
exhilarating
that
tuckle
dressed
out
with
the
cocked
hat
and
stick
danced
the
frog
hornpipe
among
the
shells
on
the
table
while
the
gentleman
in
blue
played
an
accompaniment
upon
an
ingenious
musical
instrument
formed
of
a
upon
a
at
last
when
the
punch
was
all
gone
and
the
night
nearly
so
they
sallied
forth
to
see
each
other
home
tuckle
no
sooner
got
into
the
open
air
than
he
was
seized
with
a
sudden
desire
to
lie
on
the
curbstone
sam
thought
it
would
be
a
pity
to
contradict
him
and
so
let
him
have
his
own
way
as
the
cocked
hat
would
have
been
spoiled
if
left
there
sam
very
considerately
flattened
it
down
on
the
head
of
the
gentleman
in
blue
and
putting
the
big
stick
in
his
hand
propped
him
up
against
his
own
rang
the
bell
and
walked
quietly
home
at
a
much
earlier
hour
next
morning
than
his
usual
time
of
rising
pickwick
walked
downstairs
completely
dressed
and
rang
the
bell
sam
said
pickwick
when
weller
appeared
in
reply
to
the
summons
shut
the
weller
did
so
there
was
an
unfortunate
occurrence
here
last
night
sam
said
pickwick
which
gave
winkle
some
cause
to
apprehend
violence
from
so
i
ve
heerd
from
the
old
lady
downstairs
sir
replied
sam
and
i
m
sorry
to
say
sam
continued
pickwick
with
a
most
perplexed
countenance
that
in
dread
of
this
violence
winkle
has
gone
gone
avay
said
sam
left
the
house
early
this
morning
without
the
slightest
previous
communication
with
me
replied
pickwick
and
is
gone
i
know
not
he
should
ha
stopped
and
fought
it
out
sir
replied
sam
contemptuously
it
wouldn
t
take
much
to
settle
that
ere
dowler
well
sam
said
pickwick
i
may
have
my
doubts
of
his
great
bravery
and
determination
also
but
however
that
may
be
winkle
is
gone
he
must
be
found
sam
found
and
brought
back
to
and
s
pose
he
won
t
come
back
sir
said
sam
he
must
be
made
sam
said
pickwick
who
s
to
do
it
sir
inquired
sam
with
a
smile
you
replied
pickwick
wery
good
with
these
words
weller
left
the
room
and
immediately
afterwards
was
heard
to
shut
the
street
door
in
two
hours
time
he
returned
with
so
much
coolness
as
if
he
had
been
despatched
on
the
most
ordinary
message
possible
and
brought
the
information
that
an
individual
in
every
respect
answering
winkle
s
description
had
gone
over
to
bristol
that
morning
by
the
branch
coach
from
the
royal
hotel
sam
said
pickwick
grasping
his
hand
you
re
a
capital
fellow
an
invaluable
fellow
you
must
follow
him
cert
nly
sir
replied
weller
the
instant

sam
said
pickwick
if
he
attempts
to
run

or
lock
him
up

my
full
authority

careful

rejoined
sam
you

tell
him
said
pickwick
that
i
am
highly
excited
highly
displeased
and
naturally
indignant
at
the
very
extraordinary
course
he
has
thought
proper
to
i
will
sir
replied
sam
you
ll
tell
him
said
pickwick
that
if
he
does
not

house

he

with
me
for

rejoined
sam

him
sam
said
pickwick
looking
earnestly
in
his
face
oh
i
ll
find
him
if
he
s
anyvere
rejoined
sam
with
great
confidence
very
well
said
pickwick
then
the
sooner
you
go
the
with
these
instructions
pickwick
placed
a
sum
of
money
in
the
hands
of
his
faithful
servitor
and
ordered
him
to
start
for
bristol
immediately
in
pursuit
of
the
fugitive
sam
put
a
few
necessaries
in
a
and
was
ready
for
starting
he
stopped
when
he
had
got
to
the
end
of
the
passage
and
walking
quietly
back
thrust
his
head
in
at
the
parlour
door
sir
whispered
sam
well
sam
said
pickwick
i
fully
understands
my
instructions
do
i
sir
inquired
sam

said
pickwick
it

reg
larly
understood

knockin
down

it
sir
inquired
sam
perfectly
replied
pickwick
thoroughly
do
what
you
think
necessary
you
have
my
sam
gave
a
nod
of
intelligence
and
withdrawing
his
head
from
the
door
set
forth
on
his
pilgrimage
with
a
light
heart
chapter
xxxviii
how
winkle
when
he
stepped
out
of
the
walked
gently
and
comfortably
into
the
fire
the
gentleman
who
had
been
the
unfortunate
cause
of
the
unusual
noise
and
disturbance
which
alarmed
the
inhabitants
of
the
royal
crescent
in
manner
and
form
already
described
after
passing
a
night
of
great
confusion
and
anxiety
left
the
roof
beneath
which
his
friends
still
slumbered
bound
he
knew
not
whither
the
excellent
and
considerate
feelings
which
prompted
winkle
to
take
this
step
can
never
be
too
highly
appreciated
or
too
warmly
extolled
if
reasoned
winkle
with
himself
if
this
dowler
attempts
as
i
have
no
doubt
he
will
to
carry
into
execution
his
threat
of
personal
violence
against
myself
it
will
be
incumbent
on
me
to
call
him
out
he
has
a
wife
that
wife
is
attached
to
and
dependent
on
him
heavens
if
i
should
kill
him
in
the
blindness
of
my
wrath
what
would
be
my
feelings
ever
afterwards
this
painful
consideration
operated
so
powerfully
on
the
feelings
of
the
humane
young
man
as
to
cause
his
knees
to
knock
together
and
his
countenance
to
exhibit
alarming
manifestations
of
inward
emotion
impelled
by
such
reflections
he
grasped
his
and
creeping
stealthily
downstairs
shut
the
detestable
street
door
with
as
little
noise
as
possible
and
walked
off
bending
his
steps
towards
the
royal
hotel
he
found
a
coach
on
the
point
of
starting
for
bristol
and
thinking
bristol
as
good
a
place
for
his
purpose
as
any
other
he
could
go
to
he
mounted
the
box
and
reached
his
place
of
destination
in
such
time
as
the
pair
of
horses
who
went
the
whole
stage
and
back
again
twice
a
day
or
more
could
be
reasonably
supposed
to
arrive
there
he
took
up
his
quarters
at
the
bush
and
designing
to
postpone
any
communication
by
letter
with
pickwick
until
it
was
probable
that
dowler
s
wrath
might
have
in
some
degree
evaporated
walked
forth
to
view
the
city
which
struck
him
as
being
a
shade
more
dirty
than
any
place
he
had
ever
seen
having
inspected
the
docks
and
shipping
and
viewed
the
cathedral
he
inquired
his
way
to
clifton
and
being
directed
thither
took
the
route
which
was
pointed
out
to
him
but
as
the
pavements
of
bristol
are
not
the
widest
or
cleanest
upon
earth
so
its
streets
are
not
altogether
the
straightest
or
least
intricate
and
winkle
being
greatly
puzzled
by
their
manifold
windings
and
twistings
looked
about
him
for
a
decent
shop
in
which
he
could
apply
afresh
for
counsel
and
instruction
his
eye
fell
upon
a
tenement
which
had
been
recently
converted
into
something
between
a
shop
and
a
private
house
and
which
a
red
lamp
projecting
over
the
fanlight
of
the
street
door
would
have
sufficiently
announced
as
the
residence
of
a
medical
practitioner
even
if
the
word
surgery
had
not
been
inscribed
in
golden
characters
on
a
wainscot
ground
above
the
window
of
what
in
times
bygone
had
been
the
front
parlour
thinking
this
an
eligible
place
wherein
to
make
his
inquiries
winkle
stepped
into
the
little
shop
where
the
labelled
drawers
and
bottles
were
and
finding
nobody
there
knocked
with
a
on
the
counter
to
attract
the
attention
of
anybody
who
might
happen
to
be
in
the
back
parlour
which
he
judged
to
be
the
innermost
and
peculiar
sanctum
of
the
establishment
from
the
repetition
of
the
word
surgery
on
the
door
painted
in
white
letters
this
time
by
way
of
taking
off
the
monotony
at
the
first
knock
a
sound
as
of
persons
fencing
with
which
had
until
now
been
very
audible
suddenly
ceased
at
the
second
a
young
gentleman
in
green
spectacles
with
a
very
large
book
in
his
hand
glided
quietly
into
the
shop
and
stepping
behind
the
counter
requested
to
know
the
visitor
s
pleasure
i
am
sorry
to
trouble
you
sir
said
winkle
but
will
you
have
the
goodness
to
direct
me
to
ha
ha
ha
roared
the
studious
young
gentleman
throwing
the
large
book
up
into
the
air
and
catching
it
with
great
dexterity
at
the
very
moment
when
it
threatened
to
smash
to
atoms
all
the
bottles
on
the
counter
here
s
a
start
there
was
without
doubt
for
winkle
was
so
very
much
astonished
at
the
extraordinary
behaviour
of
the
medical
gentleman
that
he
involuntarily
retreated
towards
the
door
and
looked
very
much
disturbed
at
his
strange
reception
what
don
t
you
know
me
said
the
medical
gentleman
winkle
murmured
in
reply
that
he
had
not
that
pleasure
why
then
said
the
medical
gentleman
there
are
hopes
for
me
yet
i
may
attend
half
the
old
women
in
bristol
if
i
ve
decent
luck
get
out
you
mouldy
old
villain
get
out
with
this
adjuration
which
was
addressed
to
the
large
book
the
medical
gentleman
kicked
the
volume
with
remarkable
agility
to
the
farther
end
of
the
shop
and
pulling
off
his
green
spectacles
grinned
the
identical
grin
of
robert
sawyer
esquire
formerly
of
guy
s
hospital
in
the
borough
with
a
private
residence
in
lant
street
you
don
t
mean
to
say
you
weren
t
down
upon
me
said
bob
sawyer
shaking
winkle
s
hand
with
friendly
warmth
upon
my
word
i
was
not
replied
winkle
returning
his
pressure
i
wonder
you
didn
t
see
the
name
said
bob
sawyer
calling
his
friend
s
attention
to
the
outer
door
on
which
in
the
same
white
paint
were
traced
the
words
sawyer
late
it
never
caught
my
eye
returned
winkle
lord
if
i
had
known
who
you
were
i
should
have
rushed
out
and
caught
you
in
my
arms
said
bob
sawyer
but
upon
my
life
i
thought
you
were
the
king
no
said
winkle
i
did
indeed
responded
bob
sawyer
and
i
was
just
going
to
say
that
i
wasn
t
at
home
but
if
you
d
leave
a
message
i
d
be
sure
to
give
it
to
myself
for
he
don
t
know
me
no
more
does
the
lighting
and
paving
i
think
the
guesses
who
i
am
and
i
know
the
does
because
i
drew
a
tooth
of
his
when
i
first
came
down
here
but
come
in
come
in
chattering
in
this
way
bob
sawyer
pushed
winkle
into
the
back
room
where
amusing
himself
by
boring
little
circular
caverns
in
the
with
a
poker
sat
no
less
a
person
than
benjamin
allen
well
said
winkle
this
is
indeed
a
pleasure
i
did
not
expect
what
a
very
nice
place
you
have
here
pretty
well
pretty
well
replied
bob
sawyer
i
soon
after
that
precious
party
and
my
friends
came
down
with
the
needful
for
this
business
so
i
put
on
a
black
suit
of
clothes
and
a
pair
of
spectacles
and
came
here
to
look
as
solemn
as
i
and
a
very
snug
little
business
you
have
no
doubt
said
winkle
knowingly
very
replied
bob
sawyer
so
snug
that
at
the
end
of
a
few
years
you
might
put
all
the
profits
in
a
and
cover
em
over
with
a
gooseberry
you
can
not
surely
mean
that
said
winkle
the
stock

my
dear
boy
said
bob
sawyer
half
the
drawers
have
nothing
in
em
and
the
other
half
don
t
nonsense
said
winkle
fact
honour
returned
bob
sawyer
stepping
out
into
the
shop
and
demonstrating
the
veracity
of
the
assertion
by
divers
hard
pulls
at
the
little
gilt
knobs
on
the
counterfeit
drawers
hardly
anything
real
in
the
shop
but
the
leeches
and
i
shouldn
t
have
thought
it
exclaimed
winkle
much
surprised
i
hope
not
replied
bob
sawyer
else
where
s
the
use
of
appearances
eh
but
what
will
you
take
do
as
we
do
that
s
right
ben
my
fine
fellow
put
your
hand
into
the
cupboard
and
bring
out
the
patent
benjamin
allen
smiled
his
readiness
and
produced
from
the
closet
at
his
elbow
a
black
bottle
half
full
of
brandy
you
don
t
take
water
of
course
said
bob
sawyer
thank
you
replied
winkle
it
s
rather
early
i
should
like
to
qualify
it
if
you
have
no
none
in
the
least
if
you
can
reconcile
it
to
your
conscience
replied
bob
sawyer
tossing
off
as
he
spoke
a
glass
of
the
liquor
with
great
relish
ben
the
pipkin
benjamin
allen
drew
forth
from
the
same
a
small
brass
pipkin
which
bob
sawyer
observed
he
prided
himself
upon
particularly
because
it
looked
so
the
water
in
the
professional
pipkin
having
been
made
to
boil
in
course
of
time
by
various
little
shovelfuls
of
coal
which
bob
sawyer
took
out
of
a
practicable
labelled
soda
water
winkle
adulterated
his
brandy
and
the
conversation
was
becoming
general
when
it
was
interrupted
by
the
entrance
into
the
shop
of
a
boy
in
a
sober
gray
livery
and
a
laced
hat
with
a
small
covered
basket
under
his
arm
whom
bob
sawyer
immediately
hailed
with
tom
you
vagabond
come
the
boy
presented
himself
accordingly
you

been
stopping
to
over
all
the
posts
in
bristol
you
idle
young
scamp
said
bob
sawyer
no
sir
i
haven
t
replied
the
boy
you
had
better
not
said
bob
sawyer
with
a
threatening
aspect
who
do
you
suppose
will
ever
employ
a
professional
man
when
they
see
his
boy
playing
at
marbles
in
the
gutter
or
flying
the
garter
in
the
have
you
no
feeling
for
your
profession
you
groveller
did
you
leave
all
the
medicine
yes
the
powders
for
the
child
at
the
large
house
with
the
new
family
and
the
pills
to
be
taken
four
times
a
day
at
the
old

the
gouty

then
shut
the
door
and

winkle
as
the
boy
retired
things

not
quite
so
bad
as
you
would
have
me
believe
either
there
is
to
be
sent
bob
sawyer
peeped
into
the
shop
to
see
that
no
stranger
was
within
hearing
and
leaning
forward
to
winkle
said
in
a
low
tone
he
leaves
it
all
at
the
wrong
winkle
looked
perplexed
and
bob
sawyer
and
his
friend
laughed

bob

old

it

better
than
all
the

in

we
have
got
one

been
to
half
the
houses
in
bristol
and
hasn

done
dear
me
i
see
observed
winkle
what
an
excellent
plan
oh
ben
and
i
have
hit
upon
a
dozen
such
replied
bob

with
great
glee
the
lamplighter
has
eighteenpence
a
week
to
pull
the
bell
for
ten
minutes
every
time
he
comes
round
and
my
boy
always
rushes
into
the
church
just
before
the
psalms
when
the
people
have
got
nothing
to
do
but
look
about
em
and
calls
me
out
with
horror
and
dismay
depicted
on
his
countenance
bless
my
soul
everybody
says
somebody
taken
suddenly
ill
sawyer
late
nockemorf
sent
for
what
a
business
that
young
man
has
at
the
termination
of
this
disclosure
of
some
of
the
mysteries
of
medicine
bob
sawyer
and
his
friend
ben
allen
threw
themselves
back
in
their
respective
chairs
and
laughed
boisterously
when
they
had
enjoyed
the
joke
to
their
heart
s
content
the
discourse
changed
to
topics
in
which
winkle
was
more
immediately
interested
we
think
we
have
hinted
elsewhere
that
benjamin
allen
had
a
way
of
becoming
sentimental
after
brandy
the
case
is
not
a
peculiar
one
as
we
ourself
can
testify
having
on
a
few
occasions
had
to
deal
with
patients
who
have
been
afflicted
in
a
similar
manner
at
this
precise
period
of
his
existence
benjamin
allen
had
perhaps
a
greater
predisposition
to
maudlinism
than
he
had
ever
known
before
the
cause
of
which
malady
was
briefly
this
he
had
been
staying
nearly
three
weeks
with
bob
sawyer
bob
sawyer
was
not
remarkable
for
temperance
nor
was
benjamin
allen
for
the
ownership
of
a
very
strong
head
the
consequence
was
that
during
the
whole
space
of
time
just
mentioned
benjamin
allen
had
been
wavering
between
intoxication
partial
and
intoxication
complete
my
dear
friend
said
ben
allen
taking
advantage
of
bob
sawyer
s
temporary
absence
behind
the
counter
whither
he
had
retired
to
dispense
some
of
the
leeches
previously
referred
to
my
dear
friend
i
am
very
winkle
professed
his
heartfelt
regret
to
hear
it
and
begged
to
know
whether
he
could
do
anything
to
alleviate
the
sorrows
of
the
suffering
student
nothing
my
dear
boy
nothing
said
ben
you
recollect
arabella
winkle
my
sister
arabella
a
little
girl
winkle
with
black
eyes
when
we
were
down
at
wardle
s
i
don
t
know
whether
you
happened
to
notice
her
a
nice
little
girl
winkle
perhaps
my
features
may
recall
her
countenance
to
your
recollection
winkle
required
nothing
to
recall
the
charming
arabella
to
his
mind
and
it
was
rather
fortunate
he
did
not
for
the
features
of
her
brother
benjamin
would
unquestionably
have
proved
but
an
indifferent
refresher
to
his
memory
he
answered
with
as
much
calmness
as
he
could
assume
that
he
perfectly
remembered
the
young
lady
referred
to
and
sincerely
trusted
she
was
in
good
health
our
friend
bob
is
a
delightful
fellow
winkle
was
the
only
reply
of
ben
allen
very
said
winkle
not
much
relishing
this
close
connection
of
the
two
names
i
designed
em
for
each
other
they
were
made
for
each
other
sent
into
the
world
for
each
other
born
for
each
other
winkle
said
ben
allen
setting
down
his
glass
with
emphasis
there
s
a
special
destiny
in
the
matter
my
dear
sir
there
s
only
five
years
difference
between
em
and
both
their
birthdays
are
in
winkle
was
too
anxious
to
hear
what
was
to
follow
to
express
much
wonderment
at
this
extraordinary
coincidence
marvellous
as
it
was
so
ben
allen
after
a
tear
or
two
went
on
to
say
that
notwithstanding
all
his
esteem
and
respect
and
veneration
for
his
friend
arabella
had
unaccountably
and
undutifully
evinced
the
most
determined
antipathy
to
his
person
and
i
think
said
ben
allen
in
conclusion
i
think
there
s
a
prior
have
you
any
idea
who
the
object
of
it
might
be
asked
winkle
with
great
trepidation
ben
allen
seized
the
poker
flourished
it
in
a
warlike
manner
above
his
head
inflicted
a
savage
blow
on
an
imaginary
skull
and
wound
up
by
saying
in
a
very
expressive
manner
that
he
only
wished
he
could
guess
that
was
all
i
d
show
him
what
i
thought
of
him
said
ben
allen
and
round
went
the
poker
again
more
fiercely
than
before
all
this
was
of
course
very
soothing
to
the
feelings
of
winkle
who
remained
silent
for
a
few
minutes
but
at
length
mustered
up
resolution
to
inquire
whether
miss
allen
was
in
kent
no
no
said
ben
allen
laying
aside
the
poker
and
looking
very
cunning
i
didn
t
think
wardle
s
exactly
the
place
for
a
headstrong
girl
so
as
i
am
her
natural
protector
and
guardian
our
parents
being
dead
i
have
brought
her
down
into
this
part
of
the
country
to
spend
a
few
months
at
an
old
aunt
s
in
a
nice
dull
close
place
i
think
that
will
cure
her
my
boy
if
it
doesn
t
i
ll
take
her
abroad
for
a
little
while
and
see
what
that
ll
oh
the
aunt
s
is
in
bristol
is
it
faltered
winkle
no
no
not
in
bristol
replied
ben
allen
jerking
his
thumb
over
his
right
shoulder
over
that
way
down
there
but
hush
here
s
bob
not
a
word
my
dear
friend
not
a
short
as
this
conversation
was
it
roused
in
winkle
the
highest
degree
of
excitement
and
anxiety
the
suspected
prior
attachment
rankled
in
his
heart
could
he
be
the
object
of
it
could
it
be
for
him
that
the
fair
arabella
had
looked
scornfully
on
the
sprightly
bob
sawyer
or
had
he
a
successful
rival
he
determined
to
see
her
cost
what
it
might
but
here
an
insurmountable
objection
presented
itself
for
whether
the
explanatory
over
that
way
and
down
there
of
ben
allen
meant
three
miles
off
or
thirty
or
three
hundred
he
could
in
no
wise
guess
but
he
had
no
opportunity
of
pondering
over
his
love
just
then
for
bob
sawyer
s
return
was
the
immediate
precursor
of
the
arrival
of
a
from
the
baker
s
of
which
that
gentleman
insisted
on
his
staying
to
partake
the
cloth
was
laid
by
an
occasional
charwoman
who
officiated
in
the
capacity
of
bob
sawyer
s
housekeeper
and
a
third
knife
and
fork
having
been
borrowed
from
the
mother
of
the
boy
in
the
gray
livery
for
sawyer
s
domestic
arrangements
were
as
yet
conducted
on
a
limited
scale
they
sat
down
to
dinner
the
beer
being
served
up
as
sawyer
remarked
in
its
native
after
dinner
bob
sawyer
ordered
in
the
largest
mortar
in
the
shop
and
proceeded
to
brew
a
reeking
jorum
of
therein
stirring
up
and
amalgamating
the
materials
with
a
pestle
in
a
very
creditable
and
manner
sawyer
being
a
bachelor
had
only
one
tumbler
in
the
house
which
was
assigned
to
winkle
as
a
compliment
to
the
visitor
ben
allen
being
accommodated
with
a
funnel
with
a
cork
in
the
narrow
end
and
bob
sawyer
contented
himself
with
one
of
those
crystal
vessels
inscribed
with
a
variety
of
cabalistic
characters
in
which
chemists
are
wont
to
measure
out
their
liquid
drugs
in
compounding
prescriptions
these
preliminaries
adjusted
the
punch
was
tasted
and
pronounced
excellent
and
it
having
been
arranged
that
bob
sawyer
and
ben
allen
should
be
considered
at
liberty
to
fill
twice
to
winkle
s
once
they
started
fair
with
great
satisfaction
and
there
was
no
singing
because
bob
sawyer
said
it
wouldn
t
look
professional
but
to
make
amends
for
this
deprivation
there
was
so
much
talking
and
laughing
that
it
might
have
been
heard
and
very
likely
was
at
the
end
of
the
street
which
conversation
materially
lightened
the
hours
and
improved
the
mind
of
bob
sawyer
s
boy
who
instead
of
devoting
the
evening
to
his
ordinary
occupation
of
writing
his
name
on
the
counter
and
rubbing
it
out
again
peeped
through
the
glass
door
and
thus
listened
and
looked
on
at
the
same
time
the
mirth
of
bob
sawyer
was
rapidly
ripening
into
the
furious
ben
allen
was
fast
relapsing
into
the
sentimental
and
the
punch
had
disappeared
altogether
when
the
boy
hastily
running
in
announced
that
a
young
woman
had
just
come
over
to
say
that
sawyer
late
nockemorf
was
wanted
directly
a
couple
of
streets
off
this
broke
up
the
party
bob
sawyer
understanding
the
message
after
some
twenty
repetitions
tied
a
wet
cloth
round
his
head
to
sober
himself
and
having
partially
succeeded
put
on
his
green
spectacles
and
issued
forth
resisting
all
entreaties
to
stay
till
he
came
back
and
finding
it
quite
impossible
to
engage
ben
allen
in
any
intelligible
conversation
on
the
subject
nearest
his
heart
or
indeed
on
any
other
winkle
took
his
departure
and
returned
to
the
bush
the
anxiety
of
his
mind
and
the
numerous
meditations
which
arabella
had
awakened
prevented
his
share
of
the
mortar
of
punch
producing
that
effect
upon
him
which
it
would
have
had
under
other
circumstances
so
after
taking
a
glass
of
and
brandy
at
the
bar
he
turned
into
the
dispirited
rather
than
elevated
by
the
occurrences
of
the
evening
sitting
in
front
of
the
fire
with
his
back
towards
him
was
a
tallish
gentleman
in
a
greatcoat
the
only
other
occupant
of
the
room
it
was
rather
a
cool
evening
for
the
season
of
the
year
and
the
gentleman
drew
his
chair
aside
to
afford
the
a
sight
of
the
fire
what
were
winkle
s
feelings
when
in
doing
so
he
disclosed
to
view
the
face
and
figure
of
the
vindictive
and
sanguinary
dowler
winkle
s
first
impulse
was
to
give
a
violent
pull
at
the
nearest
but
that
unfortunately
happened
to
be
immediately
behind
dowler
s
head
he
had
made
one
step
towards
it
before
he
checked
himself
as
he
did
so
dowler
very
hastily
drew
back
mr
winkle
sir
be
calm
don
t
strike
me
i
won
t
bear
it
a
blow
never
said
dowler
looking
meeker
than
winkle
had
expected
in
a
gentleman
of
his
ferocity
a
blow
sir
stammered
winkle
a
blow
sir
replied
dowler
compose
your
feelings
sit
down
hear
sir
said
winkle
trembling
from
head
to
foot
before
i
consent
to
sit
down
beside
or
opposite
you
without
the
presence
of
a
waiter
i
must
be
secured
by
some
further
understanding
you
used
a
threat
against
me
last
night
sir
a
dreadful
threat
here
winkle
turned
very
pale
indeed
and
stopped
short
i
did
said
dowler
with
a
countenance
almost
as
white
as
winkle
s
circumstances
were
suspicious
they
have
been
explained
i
respect
your
bravery
your
feeling
is
upright
conscious
innocence
there
s
my
hand
grasp
really
sir
said
winkle
hesitating
whether
to
give
his
hand
or
not
and
almost
fearing
that
it
was
demanded
in
order
that
he
might
be
taken
at
an
advantage
really
sir
i
i
know
what
you
mean
interposed
dowler
you
feel
aggrieved
very
natural
so
should
i
was
wrong
i
beg
your
pardon
be
friendly
forgive
with
this
dowler
fairly
forced
his
hand
upon
winkle
and
shaking
it
with
the
utmost
vehemence
declared
he
was
a
fellow
of
extreme
spirit
and
he
had
a
higher
opinion
of
him
than
ever
now
said
dowler
sit
down
relate
it
all
how
did
you
find
me
when
did
you
follow
be
frank
tell
it
s
quite
accidental
replied
winkle
greatly
perplexed
by
the
curious
and
unexpected
nature
of
the
interview
glad
of
it
said
dowler
i
woke
this
morning
i
had
forgotten
my
threat
i
laughed
at
the
accident
i
felt
friendly
i
said
to
whom
inquired
winkle
to
dowler
you
made
a
vow
said
she
i
did
said
i
it
was
a
rash
one
said
she
it
was
said
i
i
ll
apologise
where
is
he
who
inquired
winkle
you
replied
dowler
i
went
downstairs
you
were
not
to
be
found
pickwick
looked
gloomy
shook
his
head
hoped
no
violence
would
be
committed
i
saw
it
all
you
felt
yourself
insulted
you
had
gone
for
a
friend
perhaps
possibly
for
pistols
high
spirit
said
i
i
admire
winkle
coughed
and
beginning
to
see
how
the
land
lay
assumed
a
look
of
importance
i
left
a
note
for
you
resumed
dowler
i
said
i
was
sorry
so
i
was
pressing
business
called
me
here
you
were
not
satisfied
you
followed
you
required
a
verbal
explanation
you
were
right
it
s
all
over
now
my
business
is
finished
i
go
back
join
as
dowler
progressed
in
his
explanation
winkle
s
countenance
grew
more
and
more
dignified
the
mysterious
nature
of
the
commencement
of
their
conversation
was
explained
dowler
had
as
great
an
objection
to
duelling
as
himself
in
short
this
blustering
and
awful
personage
was
one
of
the
most
egregious
cowards
in
existence
and
interpreting
winkle
s
absence
through
the
medium
of
his
own
fears
had
taken
the
same
step
as
himself
and
prudently
retired
until
all
excitement
of
feeling
should
have
subsided
as
the
real
state
of
the
case
dawned
upon
winkle
s
mind
he
looked
very
terrible
and
said
he
was
perfectly
satisfied
but
at
the
same
time
said
so
with
an
air
that
left
dowler
no
alternative
but
to
infer
that
if
he
had
not
been
something
most
horrible
and
destructive
must
inevitably
have
occurred
dowler
appeared
to
be
impressed
with
a
becoming
sense
of
winkle
s
magnanimity
and
condescension
and
the
two
belligerents
parted
for
the
night
with
many
protestations
of
eternal
friendship
about
twelve
o
clock
when
winkle
had
been
revelling
some
twenty
minutes
in
the
full
luxury
of
his
first
sleep
he
was
suddenly
awakened
by
a
loud
knocking
at
his
chamber
door
which
being
repeated
with
increased
vehemence
caused
him
to
start
up
in
bed
and
inquire
who
was
there
and
what
the
matter
was
please
sir
here
s
a
young
man
which
says
he
must
see
you
directly
responded
the
voice
of
the
chambermaid
a
young
man
exclaimed
winkle
no
mistake
about
that
ere
sir
replied
another
voice
through
the
keyhole
and
if
that
wery
same
interestin
young
creetur
ain
t
let
in
vithout
delay
it
s
wery
possible
as
his
legs
vill
enter
afore
his
the
young
man
gave
a
gentle
kick
at
one
of
the
lower
panels
of
the
door
after
he
had
given
utterance
to
this
hint
as
if
to
add
force
and
point
to
the
remark
is
that
you
sam
inquired
winkle
springing
out
of
bed
quite
unpossible
to
identify
any
gen
l
m
n
vith
any
degree
o
mental
satisfaction
vithout
lookin
at
him
sir
replied
the
voice
dogmatically
winkle
not
much
doubting
who
the
young
man
was
unlocked
the
door
which
he
had
no
sooner
done
than
samuel
weller
entered
with
great
precipitation
and
carefully
relocking
it
on
the
inside
deliberately
put
the
key
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
and
after
surveying
winkle
from
head
to
foot
said
you
re
a
wery
humorous
young
gen
l
m
n
you
air
sir
what
do
you
mean
by
this
conduct
sam
inquired
winkle
indignantly
get
out
sir
this
instant
what
do
you
mean
sir
what
do
i
mean
retorted
sam
come
sir
this
is
rayther
too
rich
as
the
young
lady
said
when
she
remonstrated
with
the
arter
he
d
sold
her
a
pork
pie
as
had
got
nothin

immediately
sir
said
winkle
i
shall
leave
this
here
room
sir
just
precisely
at
the
wery
same
moment
as
you
leaves
it
responded
sam
speaking
in
a
forcible
manner
and
seating
himself
with
perfect
gravity
if
i
find
it
necessary
to
carry
you
away
o
course
i
shall
leave
it
the
least
bit
o
time
possible
afore
you
but
allow
me
to
express
a
hope
as
you
won
t
reduce
me
to
extremities
in
saying
wich
i
merely
quote
wot
the
nobleman
said
to
the
fractious
pennywinkle
ven
he
vouldn
t
come
out
of
his
shell
by
means
of
a
pin
and
he
conseqvently
began
to
be
afeered
that
he
should
be
obliged
to
crack
him
in
the
parlour
at
the
end
of
this
address
which
was
unusually
lengthy
for
him
weller
planted
his
hands
on
his
knees
and
looked
full
in
winkle
s
face
with
an
expression
of
countenance
which
showed
that
he
had
not
the
remotest
intention
of
being
trifled
with
you
re
a
young
man
sir
i
don
t
think
resumed
weller
in
a
tone
of
moral
reproof
to
go
inwolving
our
precious
governor
in
all
sorts
o
fanteegs
wen
he
s
made
up
his
mind
to
go
through
everythink
for
principle
you
re
far
worse
nor
dodson
sir
and
as
for
fogg
i
consider
him
a
born
angel
to
you
weller
having
accompanied
this
last
sentiment
with
an
emphatic
slap
on
each
knee
folded
his
arms
with
a
look
of
great
disgust
and
threw
himself
back
in
his
chair
as
if
awaiting
the
criminal
s
defence
my
good
fellow
said
winkle
extending
his
hand
his
teeth
chattering
all
the
time
he
spoke
for
he
had
been
standing
during
the
whole
of
weller
s
lecture
in
his
my
good
fellow
i
respect
your
attachment
to
my
excellent
friend
and
i
am
very
sorry
indeed
to
have
added
to
his
causes
for
disquiet
there
sam
there
well
said
sam
rather
sulkily
but
giving
the
proffered
hand
a
respectful
shake
at
the
same
time
well
so
you
ought
to
be
and
i
am
very
glad
to
find
you
air
for
if
i
can
help
it
i
won
t
have
him
put
upon
by
nobody
and
that
s
all
about
certainly
not
sam
said
winkle
there
now
go
to
bed
sam
and
we
ll
talk
further
about
this
in
the
i
m
wery
sorry
said
sam
but
i
can
t
go
to
not
go
to
bed
repeated
winkle
no
said
sam
shaking
his
head
can
t
be
you
don
t
mean
to
say
you
re
going
back
sam
urged
winkle
greatly
surprised
not
unless
you
particklerly
wish
it
replied
sam
but
i
mustn
t
leave
this
here
room
the
governor
s
orders
wos
nonsense
sam
said
winkle
i
must
stop
here
two
or
three
days
and
more
than
that
sam
you
must
stop
here
too
to
assist
me
in
gaining
an
interview
with
a
young
lady
miss
allen
sam
you
remember
her
whom
i
must
and
will
see
before
i
leave
but
in
reply
to
each
of
these
positions
sam
shook
his
head
with
great
firmness
and
energetically
replied
it
can
t
be
after
a
great
deal
of
argument
and
representation
on
the
part
of
winkle
however
and
a
full
disclosure
of
what
had
passed
in
the
interview
with
dowler
sam
began
to
waver
and
at
length
a
compromise
was
effected
of
which
the
following
were
the
main
and
principal
conditions
that
sam
should
retire
and
leave
winkle
in
the
undisturbed
possession
of
his
apartment
on
the
condition
that
he
had
permission
to
lock
the
door
on
the
outside
and
carry
off
the
key
provided
always
that
in
the
event
of
an
alarm
of
fire
or
other
dangerous
contingency
the
door
should
be
instantly
unlocked
that
a
letter
should
be
written
to
pickwick
early
next
morning
and
forwarded
per
dowler
requesting
his
consent
to
sam
and
winkle
s
remaining
at
bristol
for
the
purpose
and
with
the
object
already
assigned
and
begging
an
answer
by
the
next
coach
if
favourable
the
aforesaid
parties
to
remain
accordingly
and
if
not
to
return
to
bath
immediately
on
the
receipt
thereof
and
lastly
that
winkle
should
be
understood
as
distinctly
pledging
himself
not
to
resort
to
the
window
fireplace
or
other
surreptitious
mode
of
escape
in
the
meanwhile
these
stipulations
having
been
concluded
sam
locked
the
door
and
departed
he
had
nearly
got
downstairs
when
he
stopped
and
drew
the
key
from
his
pocket
i
quite
forgot
about
the
knockin
down
said
sam
half
turning
back
the
governor
distinctly
said
it
was
to
be
done
amazin
stupid
o
me
that
ere
never
mind
said
sam
brightening
up
it
s
easily
done
morrow
apparently
much
consoled
by
this
reflection
weller
once
more
deposited
the
key
in
his
pocket
and
descending
the
remainder
of
the
stairs
without
any
fresh
visitations
of
conscience
was
soon
in
common
with
the
other
inmates
of
the
house
buried
in
profound
repose
chapter

samuel
weller
being
intrusted
with
a
mission
of
love
proceeds
to
execute
it
with
what
success
will
hereinafter
appear
during
the
whole
of
next
day
sam
kept
winkle
steadily
in
sight
fully
determined
not
to
take
his
eyes
off
him
for
one
instant
until
he
should
receive
express
instructions
from
the
however
disagreeable
sam
s
very
close
watch
and
great
vigilance
were
to
winkle
he
thought
it
better
to
bear
with
them
than
by
any
act
of
violent
opposition
to
hazard
being
carried
away
by
force
which
weller
more
than
once
strongly
hinted
was
the
line
of
conduct
that
a
strict
sense
of
duty
prompted
him
to
pursue
there
is
little
reason
to
doubt
that
sam
would
very
speedily
have
quieted
his
scruples
by
bearing
winkle
back
to
bath
bound
hand
and
foot
had
not
pickwick
s
prompt
attention
to
the
note
which
dowler
had
undertaken
to
deliver
forestalled
any
such
proceeding
in
short
at
eight
o
clock
in
the
evening
pickwick
himself
walked
into
the
of
the
bush
tavern
and
told
sam
with
a
smile
to
his
very
great
relief
that
he
had
done
quite
right
and
it
was
unnecessary
for
him
to
mount
guard
any
longer
i
thought
it
better
to
come
myself
said
pickwick
addressing
winkle
as
sam
disencumbered
him
of
his
and
to
ascertain
before
i
gave
my
consent
to
sam
s
employment
in
this
matter
that
you
are
quite
in
earnest
and
serious
with
respect
to
this
young
serious
from
my
heart
from
my
soul
returned
winkle
with
great
energy
remember
said
pickwick
with
beaming
eyes
we
met
her
at
our
excellent
and
hospitable
friend
s
winkle
it
would
be
an
ill
return
to
tamper
lightly
and
without
due
consideration
with
this
young
lady
s
affections
i
ll
not
allow
that
sir
i
ll
not
allow
i
have
no
such
intention
indeed
exclaimed
winkle
warmly
i
have
considered
the
matter
well
for
a
long
time
and
i
feel
that
my
happiness
is
bound
up
in
that
s
wot
we
call
tying
it
up
in
a
small
parcel
sir
interposed
weller
with
an
agreeable
smile
winkle
looked
somewhat
stern
at
this
interruption
and
pickwick
angrily
requested
his
attendant
not
to
jest
with
one
of
the
best
feelings
of
our
nature
to
which
sam
replied
that
he
wouldn
t
if
he
was
aware
on
it
but
there
were
so
many
on
em
that
he
hardly
know
d
which
was
the
best
ones
wen
he
heerd
em
winkle
then
recounted
what
had
passed
between
himself
and
ben
allen
relative
to
arabella
stated
that
his
object
was
to
gain
an
interview
with
the
young
lady
and
make
a
formal
disclosure
of
his
passion
and
declared
his
conviction
founded
on
certain
dark
hints
and
mutterings
of
the
aforesaid
ben
that
wherever
she
was
at
present
immured
it
was
somewhere
near
the
downs
and
this
was
his
whole
stock
of
knowledge
or
suspicion
on
the
subject
with
this
very
slight
clue
to
guide
him
it
was
determined
that
weller
should
start
next
morning
on
an
expedition
of
discovery
it
was
also
arranged
that
pickwick
and
winkle
who
were
less
confident
of
their
powers
should
parade
the
town
meanwhile
and
accidentally
drop
in
upon
bob
sawyer
in
the
course
of
the
day
in
the
hope
of
seeing
or
hearing
something
of
the
young
lady
s
whereabouts
accordingly
next
morning
sam
weller
issued
forth
upon
his
quest
in
no
way
daunted
by
the
very
discouraging
prospect
before
him
and
away
he
walked
up
one
street
and
down
another
we
were
going
to
say
up
one
hill
and
down
another
only
it
s
all
uphill
at
clifton
without
meeting
with
anything
or
anybody
that
tended
to
throw
the
faintest
light
on
the
matter
in
hand
many
were
the
colloquies
into
which
sam
entered
with
grooms
who
were
airing
horses
on
roads
and
nursemaids
who
were
airing
children
in
lanes
but
nothing
could
sam
elicit
from
either
the
mentioned
or
the
last
which
bore
the
slightest
reference
to
the
object
of
his
inquiries
there
were
a
great
many
young
ladies
in
a
great
many
houses
the
greater
part
whereof
were
shrewdly
suspected
by
the
male
and
female
domestics
to
be
deeply
attached
to
somebody
or
perfectly
ready
to
become
so
if
opportunity
afforded
but
as
none
among
these
young
ladies
was
miss
arabella
allen
the
information
left
sam
at
exactly
the
old
point
of
wisdom
at
which
he
had
stood
before
sam
struggled
across
the
downs
against
a
good
high
wind
wondering
whether
it
was
always
necessary
to
hold
your
hat
on
with
both
hands
in
that
part
of
the
country
and
came
to
a
shady
about
which
were
sprinkled
several
little
villas
of
quiet
and
secluded
appearance
outside
a
stable
door
at
the
bottom
of
a
long
back
lane
without
a
thoroughfare
a
groom
in
undress
was
idling
about
apparently
persuading
himself
that
he
was
doing
something
with
a
spade
and
a
we
may
remark
in
this
place
that
we
have
scarcely
ever
seen
a
groom
near
a
stable
in
his
lazy
moments
who
has
not
been
to
a
greater
or
less
extent
the
victim
of
this
singular
delusion
sam
thought
he
might
as
well
talk
to
this
groom
as
to
any
one
else
especially
as
he
was
very
tired
with
walking
and
there
was
a
good
large
stone
just
opposite
the
so
he
strolled
down
the
lane
and
seating
himself
on
the
stone
opened
a
conversation
with
the
ease
and
freedom
for
which
he
was
remarkable
mornin
old
friend
said
sam
arternoon
you
mean
replied
the
groom
casting
a
surly
look
at
sam
you
re
wery
right
old
friend
said
sam
i
mean
arternoon
how
are
you
why
i
don
t
find
myself
much
the
better
for
seeing
of
you
replied
the
groom
that
s
wery
odd
that
is
said
sam
for
you
look
so
uncommon
cheerful
and
seem
altogether
so
lively
that
it
does
vun
s
heart
good
to
see
the
surly
groom
looked
surlier
still
at
this
but
not
sufficiently
so
to
produce
any
effect
upon
sam
who
immediately
inquired
with
a
countenance
of
great
anxiety
whether
his
master
s
name
was
not
walker
no
it
ain
t
said
the
groom
nor
brown
i
s
pose
said
sam
no
it
ain
nor
vilson
no
nor
that
either
said
the
groom
vell
replied
sam
then
i
m
mistaken
and
he
hasn
t
got
the
honour
o
my
acquaintance
which
i
thought
he
had
don
t
wait
here
out
o
compliment
to
me
said
sam
as
the
groom
wheeled
in
the
barrow
and
prepared
to
shut
the
gate
ease
afore
ceremony
old
boy
i
ll
excuse
i
d
knock
your
head
off
for
said
the
surly
groom
bolting
one
half
of
the
gate
couldn
t
afford
to
have
it
done
on
those
terms
rejoined
sam
it
ud
be
worth
a
life
s
board
wages
at
least
to
you
and
ud
be
cheap
at
that
make
my
compliments
indoors
tell
em
not
to
vait
dinner
for
me
and
say
they
needn
t
mind
puttin
any
by
for
it
ll
be
cold
afore
i
come
in
reply
to
this
the
groom
waxing
very
wroth
muttered
a
desire
to
damage
somebody
s
person
but
disappeared
without
carrying
it
into
execution
slamming
the
door
angrily
after
him
and
wholly
unheeding
sam
s
affectionate
request
that
he
would
leave
him
a
lock
of
his
hair
before
he
went
sam
continued
to
sit
on
the
large
stone
meditating
upon
what
was
best
to
be
done
and
revolving
in
his
mind
a
plan
for
knocking
at
all
the
doors
within
five
miles
of
bristol
taking
them
at
a
hundred
and
fifty
or
two
hundred
a
day
and
endeavouring
to
find
miss
arabella
by
that
expedient
when
accident
all
of
a
sudden
threw
in
his
way
what
he
might
have
sat
there
for
a
twelvemonth
and
yet
not
found
without
it
into
the
lane
where
he
sat
there
opened
three
or
four
garden
gates
belonging
to
as
many
houses
which
though
detached
from
each
other
were
only
separated
by
their
gardens
as
these
were
large
and
long
and
well
planted
with
trees
the
houses
were
not
only
at
some
distance
off
but
the
greater
part
of
them
were
nearly
concealed
from
view
sam
was
sitting
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
outside
the
next
gate
to
that
by
which
the
groom
had
disappeared
profoundly
turning
over
in
his
mind
the
difficulties
of
his
present
undertaking
when
the
gate
opened
and
a
female
servant
came
out
into
the
lane
to
shake
some
bedside
carpets
sam
was
so
very
busy
with
his
own
thoughts
that
it
is
probable
he
would
have
taken
no
more
notice
of
the
young
woman
than
just
raising
his
head
and
remarking
that
she
had
a
very
neat
and
pretty
figure
if
his
feelings
of
gallantry
had
not
been
most
strongly
roused
by
observing
that
she
had
no
one
to
help
her
and
that
the
carpets
seemed
too
heavy
for
her
single
strength
weller
was
a
gentleman
of
great
gallantry
in
his
own
way
and
he
no
sooner
remarked
this
circumstance
than
he
hastily
rose
from
the
large
stone
and
advanced
towards
her
my
dear
said
sam
sliding
up
with
an
air
of
great
respect
you
ll
spile
that
wery
pretty
figure
out
o
all
perportion
if
you
shake
them
carpets
by
yourself
let
me
help
the
young
lady
who
had
been
coyly
affecting
not
to
know
that
a
gentleman
was
so
near
turned
round
as
sam
spoke
no
doubt
indeed
she
said
so
afterwards
to
decline
this
offer
from
a
perfect
stranger
when
instead
of
speaking
she
started
back
and
uttered
a
scream
sam
was
scarcely
less
staggered
for
in
the
countenance
of
the
female
servant
he
beheld
the
very
features
of
his
valentine
the
pretty
housemaid
from
nupkins
s
wy
mary
my
dear
said
sam
lauk
weller
said
mary
how
you
do
frighten
one
sam
made
no
verbal
answer
to
this
complaint
nor
can
we
precisely
say
what
reply
he
did
make
we
merely
know
that
after
a
short
pause
mary
said
lor
do
adun
weller
and
that
his
hat
had
fallen
off
a
few
moments
before
from
both
of
which
tokens
we
should
be
disposed
to
infer
that
one
kiss
or
more
had
passed
between
the
parties
why
how
did
you
come
here
said
mary
when
the
conversation
to
which
this
interruption
had
been
offered
was
resumed
o
course
i
came
to
look
arter
you
my
darlin
replied
weller
for
once
permitting
his
passion
to
get
the
better
of
his
veracity
and
how
did
you
know
i
was
here
inquired
mary
who
could
have
told
you
that
i
took
another
service
at
ipswich
and
that
they
afterwards
moved
all
the
way
here
who
told
you
that
weller
ah
to
be
sure
said
sam
with
a
cunning
look
that
s
the
pint
who
could
ha
told
me
it
wasn
t
muzzle
was
it
inquired
mary
oh
replied
sam
with
a
solemn
shake
of
the
head
it
warn
t
it
must
have

but
that

nothin
if

young

and
here
sam
with
many
digressions
upon
the
personal
beauty
of
mary
and
the
unspeakable
tortures
he
had
experienced
since
he
last
saw
her
gave
a
faithful
account
of
winkle

present
predicament
well

said
mary
in
great
astonishment
miss
arabella
allen
said
sam
goodness
gracious
said
mary
pointing
to
the
garden
door
which
the
sulky
groom
had
locked
after
him
why
it
s
that
very
house
she
s
been
living
there
these
six
weeks
their
upper
which
is
lady
maid
too
told
me
all
about
it
over
the
palin
s
before
the
family
was
out
of
bed
one
mornin
wot
the
wery
next
door
to
you
said
sam
the
very
next
replied
mary
weller
was
so
deeply
overcome
on
receiving
this
intelligence
that
he
found
it
absolutely
necessary
to
cling
to
his
fair
informant
for
support
and
divers
little
love
passages
had
passed
between
them
before
he
was
sufficiently
collected
to
return
to
the
subject
vell
said
sam
at
length
if
this
don
t
beat
nothin
never
vill
as
the
lord
mayor
said
ven
the
chief
secretary
o
state
proposed
his
missis
s
health
arter
dinner
that
wery
next
house
wy
i
ve
got
a
message
to
her
as
i
ve
been
all
day
to
ah
said
mary
but
you
can
t
deliver
it
now
because
she
only
walks
in
the
garden
in
the
evening
and
then
only
for
a
very
little
time
she
never
goes
out
without
the
old
sam
ruminated
for
a
few
moments
and
finally
hit
upon
the
following
plan
of
operations
that
he
should
return
just
at
dusk
the
time
at
which
arabella
invariably
took
her
walk
and
being
admitted
by
mary
into
the
garden
of
the
house
to
which
she
belonged
would
contrive
to
scramble
up
the
wall
beneath
the
overhanging
boughs
of
a
large
which
would
effectually
screen
him
from
observation
would
there
deliver
his
message
and
arrange
if
possible
an
interview
on
behalf
of
winkle
for
the
ensuing
evening
at
the
same
hour
having
made
this
arrangement
with
great
despatch
he
assisted
mary
in
the
occupation
of
shaking
the
carpets
it
is
not
half
as
innocent
a
thing
as
it
looks
that
shaking
little
pieces
of
carpet
at
least
there
may
be
no
great
harm
in
the
shaking
but
the
folding
is
a
very
insidious
process
so
long
as
the
shaking
lasts
and
the
two
parties
are
kept
the
carpet
s
length
apart
it
is
as
innocent
an
amusement
as
can
well
be
devised
but
when
the
folding
begins
and
the
distance
between
them
gets
gradually
lessened
from
one
half
its
former
length
to
a
quarter
and
then
to
an
eighth
and
then
to
a
sixteenth
and
then
to
a
if
the
carpet
be
long
enough
it
becomes
dangerous
we
do
not
know
to
a
nicety
how
many
pieces
of
carpet
were
folded
in
this
instance
but
we
can
venture
to
state
that
as
many
pieces
as
there
were
so
many
times
did
sam
kiss
the
pretty
housemaid
weller
regaled
himself
with
moderation
at
the
nearest
tavern
until
it
was
nearly
dusk
and
then
returned
to
the
lane
without
the
thoroughfare
having
been
admitted
into
the
garden
by
mary
and
having
received
from
that
lady
sundry
admonitions
concerning
the
safety
of
his
limbs
and
neck
sam
mounted
into
the
to
wait
until
arabella
should
come
into
sight
he
waited
so
long
without
this
event
occurring
that
he
began
to
think
it
was
not
going
to
take
place
at
all
when
he
heard
light
footsteps
upon
the
gravel
and
immediately
afterwards
beheld
arabella
walking
pensively
down
the
garden
as
soon
as
she
came
nearly
below
the
tree
sam
began
by
way
of
gently
indicating
his
presence
to
make
sundry
diabolical
noises
similar
to
those
which
would
probably
be
natural
to
a
person
of
middle
age
who
had
been
afflicted
with
a
combination
of
inflammatory
sore
throat
croup
and
from
his
earliest
infancy
upon
this
the
young
lady
cast
a
hurried
glance
towards
the
spot
whence
the
dreadful
sounds
proceeded
and
her
previous
alarm
being
not
at
all
diminished
when
she
saw
a
man
among
the
branches
she
would
most
certainly
have
decamped
and
alarmed
the
house
had
not
fear
fortunately
deprived
her
of
the
power
of
moving
and
caused
her
to
sink
down
on
a
garden
seat
which
happened
by
good
luck
to
be
near
at
hand
she
s
off
soliloquised
sam
in
great
perplexity
wot
a
thing
it
is
as
these
here
young
creeturs
will
go
avay
just
ven
they
oughtn
t
to
here
young
ooman
miss
sawbones
vinkle
don
t
whether
it
was
the
magic
of
winkle
s
name
or
the
coolness
of
the
open
air
or
some
recollection
of
weller
s
voice
that
revived
arabella
matters
not
she
raised
her
head
and
languidly
inquired
who
s
that
and
what
do
you
want
hush
said
sam
swinging
himself
on
to
the
wall
and
crouching
there
in
as
small
a
compass
as
he
could
reduce
himself
to
only
me
miss
only
mr
pickwick
s
servant
said
arabella
earnestly
the
wery
same
miss
replied
sam
here
s
vinkle
reg
larly
sewed
up
vith
desperation
ah
said
arabella
drawing
nearer
the
wall
ah
indeed
said
sam
ve
thought
ve
should
ha
been
obliged
to
him
last
night
he
s
been
all
day
and
he
says
if
he
can
t
see
you
afore
night
s
over
he
vishes
he
may
be
somethin
unpleasanted
if
he
don
t
drownd
oh
no
no
weller
said
arabella
clasping
her
hands
that
s
wot
he
says
miss
replied
sam
coolly
he
s
a
man
of
his
word
and
it
s
my
opinion
he
ll
do
it
miss
he
s
heerd
all
about
you
from
the
sawbones
in
from
my
brother
said
arabella
having
some
faint
recognition
of
sam
s
description
i
don
t
rightly
know
which
is
your
brother
miss
replied
sam
is
it
the
dirtiest
vun
o
the
two
yes
yes
weller
returned
arabella
go
on
make
haste
well
miss
said
sam
he
s
heerd
all
about
it
from
him
and
it
s
the
gov
nor
s
opinion
that
if
you
don
t
see
him
wery
quick
the
sawbones
as
we
ve
been
on
ull
get
as
much
extra
lead
in
his
head
as
ll
rayther
damage
the
dewelopment
o
the
orgins
if
they
ever
put
it
in
spirits
oh
what
can
i
do
to
prevent
these
dreadful
quarrels
exclaimed
arabella
it
s
the
suspicion
of
a
priory
tachment
as
is
the
cause
of
it
all
replied
sam
you
d
better
see
him
but
how
where
cried
arabella
i
dare
not
leave
the
house
alone
my
brother
is
so
unkind
so
unreasonable
i
know
how
strange
my
talking
thus
to
you
may
appear
weller
but
i
am
very
very
unhappy
and
here
poor
arabella
wept
so
bitterly
that
sam
grew
chivalrous
it
may
seem
wery
strange
talkin
to
me
about
these
here
affairs
miss
said
sam
with
great
vehemence
but
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
m
not
only
ready
but
villin
to
do
anythin
as
ll
make
matters
agreeable
and
if
chuckin
either
o
them
sawboneses
out
o
winder
ull
do
it
i
m
the
as
sam
weller
said
this
he
tucked
up
his
wristbands
at
the
imminent
hazard
of
falling
off
the
wall
in
so
doing
to
intimate
his
readiness
to
set
to
work
immediately
flattering
as
these
professions
of
good
feeling
were
arabella
resolutely
declined
most
unaccountably
as
sam
thought
to
avail
herself
of
them
for
some
time
she
strenuously
refused
to
grant
winkle
the
interview
sam
had
so
pathetically
requested
but
at
length
when
the
conversation
threatened
to
be
interrupted
by
the
unwelcome
arrival
of
a
third
party
she
hurriedly
gave
him
to
understand
with
many
professions
of
gratitude
that
it
was
barely
possible
she
might
be
in
the
garden
an
hour
later
next
evening
sam
understood
this
perfectly
well
and
arabella
bestowing
upon
him
one
of
her
sweetest
smiles
tripped
gracefully
away
leaving
weller
in
a
state
of
very
great
admiration
of
her
charms
both
personal
and
mental
having
descended
in
safety
from
the
wall
and
not
forgotten
to
devote
a
few
moments
to
his
own
particular
business
in
the
same
department
weller
then
made
the
best
of
his
way
back
to
the
bush
where
his
prolonged
absence
had
occasioned
much
speculation
and
some
alarm
we
must
be
careful
said
pickwick
after
listening
attentively
to
sam
s
tale
not
for
our
sakes
but
for
that
of
the
young
lady
we
must
be
very
said
winkle
with
marked
emphasis
pickwick
s
momentary
look
of
indignation
at
the
tone
of
this
remark
subsided
into
his
characteristic
expression
of
benevolence
as
he
replied
sir
i
shall
accompany
you
said
winkle
i
replied
pickwick
mildly
in
affording
you
this
interview
the
young
lady
has
taken
a
natural
perhaps
but
still
a
very
imprudent
step
if
i
am
present
at
the
meeting
a
mutual
friend
who
is
old
enough
to
be
the
father
of
both
parties
the
voice
of
calumny
can
never
be
raised
against
her
pickwick
s
eyes
lightened
with
honest
exultation
at
his
own
foresight
as
he
spoke
thus
winkle
was
touched
by
this
little
trait
of
his
delicate
respect
for
the
young
his
friend
and
took
his
hand
with
a
feeling
of
regard
akin
to
veneration
you
go
said
winkle
i
will
said
pickwick
sam
have
my
greatcoat
and
shawl
ready
and
order
a
conveyance
to
be
at
the
door
evening
rather
earlier
than
is
absolutely
necessary
in
order
that
we
may
be
in
good
weller
touched
his
hat
as
an
earnest
of
his
obedience
and
withdrew
to
make
all
needful
preparations
for
the
expedition
the
coach
was
punctual
to
the
time
appointed
and
weller
after
duly
installing
pickwick
and
winkle
inside
took
his
seat
on
the
box
by
the
driver
they
alighted
as
had
been
agreed
on
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
place
of
rendezvous
and
desiring
the
coachman
to
await
their
return
proceeded
the
remaining
distance
on
foot
it
was
at
this
stage
of
the
undertaking
that
pickwick
with
many
smiles
and
various
other
indications
of
great
produced
from
one
of
his
coat
pockets
a
dark
lantern
with
which
he
had
specially
provided
himself
for
the
occasion
and
the
great
mechanical
beauty
of
which
he
proceeded
to
explain
to
winkle
as
they
walked
along
to
the
no
small
surprise
of
the
few
stragglers
they
met
i
should
have
been
the
better
for
something
of
this
kind
in
my
last
garden
expedition
at
night
eh
sam
said
pickwick
looking
humouredly
round
at
his
follower
who
was
trudging
behind
wery
nice
things
if
they
re
managed
properly
sir
replied
weller
but
wen
you
don
t
want
to
be
seen
i
think
they
re
more
useful
arter
the
candle
s
gone
out
than
wen
it
s
pickwick
appeared
struck
by
sam
s
remarks
for
he
put
the
lantern
into
his
pocket
again
and
they
walked
on
in
silence
down
here
sir
said
sam
let
me
lead
the
way
this
is
the
lane
down
the
lane
they
went
and
dark
enough
it
was
pickwick
brought
out
the
lantern
once
or
twice
as
they
groped
their
way
along
and
threw
a
very
brilliant
little
tunnel
of
light
before
them
about
a
foot
in
diameter
it
was
very
pretty
to
look
at
but
seemed
to
have
the
effect
of
rendering
surrounding
objects
rather
darker
than
before
at
length
they
arrived
at
the
large
stone
here
sam
recommended
his
master
and
winkle
to
seat
themselves
while
he
reconnoitred
and
ascertained
whether
mary
was
yet
in
waiting
after
an
absence
of
five
or
ten
minutes
sam
returned
to
say
that
the
gate
was
opened
and
all
quiet
following
him
with
stealthy
tread
pickwick
and
winkle
soon
found
themselves
in
the
garden
here
everybody
said
hush
a
good
many
times
and
that
being
done
no
one
seemed
to
have
any
very
distinct
apprehension
of
what
was
to
be
done
next
is
miss
allen
in
the
garden
yet
mary
inquired
winkle
much
agitated
i
don
t
know
sir
replied
the
pretty
housemaid
the
best
thing
to
be
done
sir
will
be
for
weller
to
give
you
a
hoist
up
into
the
tree
and
perhaps
pickwick
will
have
the
goodness
to
see
that
nobody
comes
up
the
lane
while
i
watch
at
the
other
end
of
the
garden
goodness
gracious
what
s
that
that
ere
blessed
lantern
ull
be
the
death
on
us
all
exclaimed
sam
peevishly
take
care
wot
you
re
on
sir
you
re
a
blaze
o
light
right
into
the
back
parlour
dear
me
said
pickwick
turning
hastily
aside
i
didn
t
mean
to
do
now
it
s
in
the
next
house
sir
remonstrated
sam
bless
my
heart
exclaimed
pickwick
turning
round
again
now
it
s
in
the
stable
and
they
ll
think
the
place
is
afire
said
sam
shut
it
up
sir
can
t
you
it
s
the
most
extraordinary
lantern
i
ever
met
with
in
all
my
life
exclaimed
pickwick
greatly
bewildered
by
the
effects
he
had
so
unintentionally
produced
i
never
saw
such
a
powerful
it
ll
be
vun
too
powerful
for
us
if
you
keep
blazin
avay
in
that
manner
sir
replied
sam
as
pickwick
after
various
unsuccessful
efforts
managed
to
close
the
slide
there
s
the
young
lady
s
footsteps
now
winkle
sir
up
vith
stop
stop
said
pickwick
i
must
speak
to
her
first
help
me
up
gently
sir
said
sam
planting
his
head
against
the
wall
and
making
a
platform
of
his
back
step
atop
o
that
ere
sir
now
then
up
vith
i
m
afraid
i
shall
hurt

sam
said
pickwick
never

me
sir
replied
sam
lend
him
a
hand
winkle
sir
steady
sir
steady
that
s
the
time
o
day
as
sam
spoke
pickwick
by
exertions
almost
supernatural
in
a
gentleman
of
his
years
and
weight
contrived
to
get
upon
sam
s
back
and
sam
gently
raising
himself
up
and
pickwick
holding
on
fast
by
the
top
of
the
wall
while
winkle
clasped
him
tight
by
the
legs
they
contrived
by
these
means
to
bring
his
spectacles
just
above
the
level
of
the
coping
my
dear
said
pickwick
looking
over
the
wall
and
catching
sight
of
arabella
on
the
other
side
don
t
be
frightened
my
dear
it
s
only
oh
pray
go
away
pickwick
said
arabella
tell
them
all
to
go
away
i
am
so
dreadfully
frightened
dear
dear
pickwick
don
t
stop
there
you
ll
fall
down
and
kill
yourself
i
know
you
now
pray
don
t
alarm
yourself
my
dear
said
pickwick
soothingly
there
is
not
the
least
cause
for
fear
i
assure
you
stand
firm
sam
said
pickwick
looking
down
all
right
sir
replied
weller
don
t
be
longer
than
you
can
conweniently
help
sir
you
re
rayther
only
another
moment
sam
replied
pickwick
i
merely
wished
you
to
know
my
dear
that
i
should
not
have
allowed
my
young
friend
to
see
you
in
this
clandestine
way
if
the
situation
in
which
you
are

left
him
any
alternative
and
lest
the
impropriety
of
this
step
should
cause
you
any
uneasiness
my
love
it
may
be
a
satisfaction
to
you
to
know
that
i
am
present
that

all
my
indeed
pickwick
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
your
kindness
and
consideration
replied
arabella
drying
her
tears
with
her
handkerchief
she
would
probably
have
said
much
more
had
not
pickwick
s
head
disappeared
with
great
swiftness
in
consequence
of
a
false
step
on
sam
s
shoulder
which
brought
him
suddenly
to
the
ground
he
was
up
again
in
an
instant
however
and
bidding
winkle
make
haste
and
get
the
interview
over
ran
out
into
the
lane
to
keep
watch
with
all
the
courage
and
ardour
of
youth
winkle
himself
inspired
by
the
occasion
was
on
the
wall
in
a
moment
merely
pausing
to
request
sam
to
be
careful
of
his
master
i
ll
take
care
on
him
sir
replied
sam
leave
him
to
where
is
he
what
s
he
doing
sam
inquired
winkle
bless
his
old
gaiters
rejoined
sam
looking
out
at
the
garden
door
he
s
guard
in
the
lane
vith
that
ere
dark
lantern
like
a
amiable
guy
fawkes
i
never
see
such
a
fine
creetur
in
my
days
blessed
if
i
don
t
think
his
heart
must
ha
been
born
year
arter
his
body
at
least
winkle
stayed
not
to
hear
the
encomium
upon
his
friend
he
had
dropped
from
the
wall
thrown
himself
at
arabella
s
feet
and
by
this
time
was
pleading
the
sincerity
of
his
passion
with
an
eloquence
worthy
even
of
pickwick
himself
while
these
things
were
going
on
in
the
open
air
an
elderly
gentleman
of
scientific
attainments
was
seated
in
his
library
two
or
three
houses
off
writing
a
philosophical
treatise
and
ever
and
anon
moistening
his
clay
and
his
labours
with
a
glass
of
claret
from
a
bottle
which
stood
by
his
side
in
the
agonies
of
composition
the
elderly
gentleman
looked
sometimes
at
the
carpet
sometimes
at
the
ceiling
and
sometimes
at
the
wall
and
when
neither
carpet
ceiling
nor
wall
afforded
the
requisite
degree
of
inspiration
he
looked
out
of
the
window
in
one
of
these
pauses
of
invention
the
scientific
gentleman
was
gazing
abstractedly
on
the
thick
darkness
outside
when
he
was
very
much
surprised
by
observing
a
most
brilliant
light
glide
through
the
air
at
a
short
distance
above
the
ground
and
almost
instantaneously
vanish
after
a
short
time
the
phenomenon
was
repeated
not
once
or
twice
but
several
times
at
last
the
scientific
gentleman
laying
down
his
pen
began
to
consider
to
what
natural
causes
these
appearances
were
to
be
assigned
they
were
not
meteors
they
were
too
low
they
were
not
they
were
too
high
they
were
not
they
were
not
fireflies
they
were
not
fireworks
what
could
they
be
some
extraordinary
and
wonderful
phenomenon
of
nature
which
no
philosopher
had
ever
seen
before
something
which
it
had
been
reserved
for
him
alone
to
discover
and
which
he
should
immortalise
his
name
by
chronicling
for
the
benefit
of
posterity
full
of
this
idea
the
scientific
gentleman
seized
his
pen
again
and
committed
to
paper
sundry
notes
of
these
unparalleled
appearances
with
the
date
day
hour
minute
and
precise
second
at
which
they
were
visible
all
of
which
were
to
form
the
data
of
a
voluminous
treatise
of
great
research
and
deep
learning
which
should
astonish
all
the
atmospherical
wiseacres
that
ever
drew
breath
in
any
part
of
the
civilised
globe
he
threw
himself
back
in
his
wrapped
in
contemplations
of
his
future
greatness
the
mysterious
light
appeared
more
brilliantly
than
before
dancing
to
all
appearance
up
and
down
the
lane
crossing
from
side
to
side
and
moving
in
an
orbit
as
eccentric
as
comets
themselves
the
scientific
gentleman
was
a
bachelor
he
had
no
wife
to
call
in
and
astonish
so
he
rang
the
bell
for
his
servant
pruffle
said
the
scientific
gentleman
there
is
something
very
extraordinary
in
the
air
did
you
see
that
said
the
scientific
gentleman
pointing
out
of
the
window
as
the
light
again
became
visible
yes
i
did
what
do
you
think
of
it
pruffle
think
of
it
sir
yes
you
have
been
bred
up
in
this
country
what
should
you
say
was
the
cause
for
those
lights
now
the
scientific
gentleman
smilingly
anticipated
pruffle
s
reply
that
he
could
assign
no
cause
for
them
at
all
pruffle
meditated
i
should
say
it
was
thieves
sir
said
pruffle
at
length
you
re
a
fool
and
may
go
downstairs
said
the
scientific
gentleman
thank
you
sir
said
pruffle
and
down
he
went
but
the
scientific
gentleman
could
not
rest
under
the
idea
of
the
ingenious
treatise
he
had
projected
being
lost
to
the
world
which
must
inevitably
be
the
case
if
the
speculation
of
the
ingenious
pruffle
were
not
stifled
in
its
birth
he
put
on
his
hat
and
walked
quickly
down
the
garden
determined
to
investigate
the
matter
to
the
very
bottom
now
shortly
before
the
scientific
gentleman
walked
out
into
the
garden
pickwick
had
run
down
the
lane
as
fast
as
he
could
to
convey
a
false
alarm
that
somebody
was
coming
that
way
occasionally
drawing
back
the
slide
of
the
dark
lantern
to
keep
himself
from
the
ditch
the
alarm
was
no
sooner
given
than
winkle
scrambled
back
over
the
wall
and
arabella
ran
into
the
house
the
garden
gate
was
shut
and
the
three
adventurers
were
making
the
best
of
their
way
down
the
lane
when
they
were
startled
by
the
scientific
gentleman
unlocking
his
garden
gate
hold
hard
whispered
sam
who
was
of
course
the
first
of
the
party
show
a
light
for
just
vun
second
pickwick
did
as
he
was
desired
and
sam
seeing
a
man
s
head
peeping
out
very
cautiously
within
half
a
yard
of
his
own
gave
it
a
gentle
tap
with
his
clenched
fist
which
knocked
it
with
a
hollow
sound
against
the
gate
having
performed
this
feat
with
great
suddenness
and
dexterity
weller
caught
pickwick
up
on
his
back
and
followed
winkle
down
the
lane
at
a
pace
which
considering
the
burden
he
carried
was
perfectly
astonishing
have
you
got
your
vind
back
agin
sir
inquired
sam
when
they
had
reached
the
end
quite
quite
now
replied
pickwick
then
come
along
sir
said
sam
setting
his
master
on
his
feet
again
come
betveen
us
sir
not
half
a
mile
to
run
think
you
re
vinnin
a
cup
sir
now
for
thus
encouraged
pickwick
made
the
very
best
use
of
his
legs
it
may
be
confidently
stated
that
a
pair
of
black
gaiters
never
got
over
the
ground
in
better
style
than
did
those
of
pickwick
on
this
memorable
occasion
the
coach
was
waiting
the
horses
were
fresh
the
roads
were
good
and
the
driver
was
willing
the
whole
party
arrived
in
safety
at
the
bush
before
pickwick
had
recovered
his
breath
in
with
you
at
once
sir
said
sam
as
he
helped
his
master
out
don
t
stop
a
second
in
the
street
arter
that
ere
exercise
beg
your
pardon
sir
continued
sam
touching
his
hat
as
winkle
descended
hope
there
warn
t
a
priory
tachment
sir
winkle
grasped
his
humble
friend
by
the
hand
and
whispered
in
his
ear
it
s
all
right
sam
quite
upon
which
weller
struck
three
distinct
blows
upon
his
nose
in
token
of
intelligence
smiled
winked
and
proceeded
to
put
the
steps
up
with
a
countenance
expressive
of
lively
satisfaction
as
to
the
scientific
gentleman
he
demonstrated
in
a
masterly
treatise
that
these
wonderful
lights
were
the
effect
of
electricity
and
clearly
proved
the
same
by
detailing
how
a
flash
of
fire
danced
before
his
eyes
when
he
put
his
head
out
of
the
gate
and
how
he
received
a
shock
which
stunned
him
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
afterwards
which
demonstration
delighted
all
the
scientific
associations
beyond
measure
and
caused
him
to
be
considered
a
light
of
science
ever
afterwards
chapter
xl
introduces
pickwick
to
a
new
and
not
uninteresting
scene
in
the
great
drama
of
life
the
remainder
of
the
period
which
pickwick
had
assigned
as
the
duration
of
the
stay
at
bath
passed
over
without
the
occurrence
of
anything
material
trinity
term
commenced
on
the
expiration
of
its
first
week
pickwick
and
his
friends
returned
to
london
and
the
former
gentleman
attended
of
course
by
sam
straightway
repaired
to
his
old
quarters
at
the
george
and
vulture
on
the
third
morning
after
their
arrival
just
as
all
the
clocks
in
the
city
were
striking
nine
individually
and
somewhere
about
nine
hundred
and
collectively
sam
was
taking
the
air
in
george
yard
when
a
queer
sort
of
vehicle
drove
up
out
of
which
there
jumped
with
great
agility
throwing
the
reins
to
a
stout
man
who
sat
beside
him
a
queer
sort
of
gentleman
who
seemed
made
for
the
vehicle
and
the
vehicle
for
him
the
vehicle
was
not
exactly
a
gig
neither
was
it
a
stanhope
it
was
not
what
is
currently
denominated
a
neither
was
it
a
taxed
cart
nor
a
nor
a
guillotined
cabriolet
and
yet
it
had
something
of
the
character
of
each
and
every
of
these
machines
it
was
painted
a
bright
yellow
with
the
shafts
and
wheels
picked
out
in
black
and
the
driver
sat
in
the
orthodox
sporting
style
on
cushions
piled
about
two
feet
above
the
rail
the
horse
was
a
bay
a
animal
enough
but
with
something
of
a
flash
and
air
about
him
nevertheless
which
accorded
both
with
the
vehicle
and
his
master
the
master
himself
was
a
man
of
about
forty
with
black
hair
and
carefully
combed
whiskers
he
was
dressed
in
a
particularly
gorgeous
manner
with
plenty
of
articles
of
jewellery
about
him
all
about
three
sizes
larger
than
those
which
are
usually
worn
by
gentlemen
and
a
rough
greatcoat
to
crown
the
whole
into
one
pocket
of
this
greatcoat
he
thrust
his
left
hand
the
moment
he
dismounted
while
from
the
other
he
drew
forth
with
his
right
a
very
bright
and
glaring
silk
handkerchief
with
which
he
whisked
a
speck
or
two
of
dust
from
his
boots
and
then
crumpling
it
in
his
hand
swaggered
up
the
court
it
had
not
escaped
sam
s
attention
that
when
this
person
dismounted
a
man
in
a
brown
greatcoat
shorn
of
divers
buttons
who
had
been
previously
slinking
about
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
crossed
over
and
remained
stationary
close
by
having
something
more
than
a
suspicion
of
the
object
of
the
gentleman
s
visit
sam
preceded
him
to
the
george
and
vulture
and
turning
sharp
round
planted
himself
in
the
centre
of
the
doorway
now
my
fine
fellow
said
the
man
in
the
rough
coat
in
an
imperious
tone
attempting
at
the
same
time
to
push
his
way
past
now
sir
wot
s
the
matter
replied
sam
returning
the
push
with
compound
interest
come
none
of
this
my
man
this
won
t
do
with
me
said
the
owner
of
the
rough
coat
raising
his
voice
and
turning
white
here
smouch
well
wot
s
amiss
here
growled
the
man
in
the
brown
coat
who
had
been
gradually
sneaking
up
the
court
during
this
short
dialogue
only
some
insolence
of
this
young
man
s
said
the
principal
giving
sam
another
push
come
none
o
this
gammon
growled
smouch
giving
him
another
and
a
harder
one
this
last
push
had
the
effect
which
it
was
intended
by
the
experienced
smouch
to
produce
for
while
sam
anxious
to
return
the
compliment
was
grinding
that
gentleman
s
body
against
the
the
principal
crept
past
and
made
his
way
to
the
bar
whither
sam
after
bandying
a
few
epithetical
remarks
with
smouch
followed
at
once
my
dear
said
the
principal
addressing
the
young
lady
at
the
bar
with
botany
bay
ease
and
new
south
wales
gentility
which
is
pickwick
s
room
my
dear
show
him
up
said
the
barmaid
to
a
waiter
without
deigning
another
look
at
the
exquisite
in
reply
to
his
inquiry
the
waiter
led
the
way
upstairs
as
he
was
desired
and
the
man
in
the
rough
coat
followed
with
sam
behind
him
who
in
his
progress
up
the
staircase
indulged
in
sundry
gestures
indicative
of
supreme
contempt
and
defiance
to
the
unspeakable
gratification
of
the
servants
and
other
smouch
who
was
troubled
with
a
hoarse
cough
remained
below
and
expectorated
in
the
passage
pickwick
was
fast
asleep
in
bed
when
his
early
visitor
followed
by
sam
entered
the
room
the
noise
they
made
in
so
doing
awoke
him
sam
said
pickwick
from
within
the
curtains
shave
you
directly
pickwick
said
the
visitor
drawing
one
of
them
back
from
the
bed

head
i
ve
got
an
execution
against

giving
pickwick
a
friendly
tap
on
the
shoulder
the
sheriff
s
officer
for
such
he
was
threw
his
card
on
the
counterpane
and
pulled
a
gold
toothpick
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
namby
s
the
name
said
the
sheriff

deputy
as
pickwick
took
his
spectacles
from
under
the
pillow
and
put
them
on
to
read

said
sam
i
ll
do
the

to
you
take
your
hat
with
this
weller
in
the
most
dexterous
manner
knocked
namby
s
hat
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
with
such
violence
that
he
had
very
nearly
caused
him
to
swallow
the
gold
toothpick
into
the
bargain
observe
this
pickwick
said
the
disconcerted
officer
gasping
for
breath
i

been
assaulted
in
the
execution
of
my
dooty
by
your
servant
in
your
chamber
i

sir
i
d
pitch
him
out
o
winder
only
he
couldn
t
fall
far
enough
cause
o
the
leads
sam
said
pickwick
in
an
angry
voice
as
his
attendant
made
various
demonstrations
of
hostilities
if
you
say
another
word
or
offer
the
slightest
interference
with
this
person
i
discharge
you
that
but
sir
said
sam
hold
your
tongue
interposed
pickwick
take
that
hat
up
but
this
sam
flatly
and
positively
refused
to
do
and
after
he
had
been
severely
reprimanded
by
his
master
the
officer
being
in
a
hurry
condescended
to
pick
it
up
himself
venting
a
great
variety
of
threats
against
sam
meanwhile
which
that
gentleman
received
with
perfect
composure
merely
observing
that
if
namby
would
have
the
goodness
to
put
his
hat
on
again
he
would
knock
it
into
the
latter
end
of
next
week
namby
perhaps
thinking
that
such
a
process
might
be
productive
of
inconvenience
to
himself
declined
to
offer
the
temptation
and
soon
after
called
up
smouch
having
informed
him
that
the
capture
was
made
and
that
he
was
to
wait
for
the
prisoner
until
he
should
have
finished
dressing
namby
then
swaggered
out
and
drove
away
smouch
requesting
pickwick
in
a
surly
manner
to
be
as
alive
as
he
could
for
it
was
a
busy
time
drew
up
a
chair
by
the
door
and
sat
there
until
he
had
finished
dressing
sam
was
then
despatched
for
a
and
in
it
the
triumvirate
proceeded
to
coleman
street
it
was
fortunate
the
distance
was
short
for
smouch
besides
possessing
no
very
enchanting
conversational
powers
was
rendered
a
decidedly
unpleasant
companion
in
a
limited
space
by
the
physical
weakness
to
which
we
have
elsewhere
adverted
the
coach
having
turned
into
a
very
narrow
and
dark
street
stopped
before
a
house
with
iron
bars
to
all
the
windows
the
of
which
were
graced
by
the
name
and
title
of
namby
officer
to
the
sheriffs
of
london
the
inner
gate
having
been
opened
by
a
gentleman
who
might
have
passed
for
a
neglected
of
smouch
and
who
was
endowed
with
a
large
key
for
the
purpose
pickwick
was
shown
into
the
this
was
a
front
parlour
the
principal
features
of
which
were
fresh
sand
and
stale
tobacco
smoke
pickwick
bowed
to
the
three
persons
who
were
seated
in
it
when
he
entered
and
having
despatched
sam
for
perker
withdrew
into
an
obscure
corner
and
looked
thence
with
some
curiosity
upon
his
new
companions
one
of
these
was
a
mere
boy
of
nineteen
or
twenty
who
though
it
was
yet
barely
ten
o
clock
was
drinking
and
smoking
a
to
which
judging
from
his
inflamed
countenance
he
had
devoted
himself
pretty
constantly
for
the
last
year
or
two
of
his
life
opposite
him
engaged
in
stirring
the
fire
with
the
toe
of
his
right
boot
was
a
coarse
vulgar
young
man
of
about
thirty
with
a
sallow
face
and
harsh
voice
evidently
possessed
of
that
knowledge
of
the
world
and
captivating
freedom
of
manner
which
is
to
be
acquired
in
parlours
and
at
low
billiard
tables
the
third
tenant
of
the
apartment
was
a
man
in
a
very
old
suit
of
black
who
looked
pale
and
haggard
and
paced
up
and
down
the
room
incessantly
stopping
now
and
then
to
look
with
great
anxiety
out
of
the
window
as
if
he
expected
somebody
and
then
resuming
his
walk
you
d
better
have
the
loan
of
my
razor
this
morning
ayresleigh
said
the
man
who
was
stirring
the
fire
tipping
the
wink
to
his
friend
the
boy
thank
you
no
i
shan
t
want
it
i
expect
i
shall
be
out
in
the
course
of
an
hour
or
so
replied
the
other
in
a
hurried
manner
then
walking
again
up
to
the
window
and
once
more
returning
disappointed
he
sighed
deeply
and
left
the
room
upon
which
the
other
two
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
well
i
never
saw
such
a
game
as
that
said
the
gentleman
who
had
offered
the
razor
whose
name
appeared
to
be
price
never
price
confirmed
the
assertion
with
an
oath
and
then
laughed
again
when
of
course
the
boy
who
thought
his
companion
one
of
the
most
dashing
fellows
alive
laughed
also
you
d
hardly
think
would
you
now
said
price
turning
towards
pickwick
that
that
chap
s
been
here
a
week
yesterday
and
never
once
shaved
himself
yet
because
he
feels
so
certain
he
s
going
out
in
half
an
hour
s
time
thinks
he
may
as
well
put
it
off
till
he
gets
home
poor
man
said
pickwick
are
his
chances
of
getting
out
of
his
difficulties
really
so
great
chances
be
d
d
replied
price
he
hasn
t
half
the
ghost
of
one
i
wouldn
t
give
his
chance
of
walking
about
the
streets
this
time
ten
with
this
price
snapped
his
fingers
contemptuously
and
rang
the
bell
give
me
a
sheet
of
paper
crookey
said
price
to
the
attendant
who
in
dress
and
general
appearance
looked
something
between
a
bankrupt
glazier
and
a
drover
in
a
state
of
insolvency
and
a
glass
of
crookey
d
ye
hear
i
m
going
to
write
to
my
father
and
i
must
have
a
stimulant
or
i
shan
t
be
able
to
pitch
it
strong
enough
into
the
old
at
this
facetious
speech
the
young
boy
it
is
almost
needless
to
say
was
fairly
convulsed
that
s
right
said
price
never
say
die
all
fun
ain
t
it
prime
said
the
young
gentleman
you
ve
got
some
spirit
about
you
you
have
said
price
you
ve
seen
something
of
i
rather
think
i
have
replied
the
boy
he
had
looked
at
it
through
the
dirty
panes
of
glass
in
a
bar
door
pickwick
feeling
not
a
little
disgusted
with
this
dialogue
as
well
as
with
the
air
and
manner
of
the
two
beings
by
whom
it
had
been
carried
on
was
about
to
inquire
whether
he
could
not
be
accommodated
with
a
private
when
two
or
three
strangers
of
genteel
appearance
entered
at
sight
of
whom
the
boy
threw
his
cigar
into
the
fire
and
whispering
to
price
that
they
had
come
to
make
it
all
right
for
him
joined
them
at
a
table
in
the
farther
end
of
the
room
it
would
appear
however
that
matters
were
not
going
to
be
made
all
right
quite
so
speedily
as
the
young
gentleman
anticipated
for
a
very
long
conversation
ensued
of
which
pickwick
could
not
avoid
hearing
certain
angry
fragments
regarding
dissolute
conduct
and
repeated
forgiveness
at
last
there
were
very
distinct
allusions
made
by
the
oldest
gentleman
of
the
party
to
one
whitecross
street
at
which
the
young
gentleman
notwithstanding
his
primeness
and
his
spirit
and
his
knowledge
of
life
into
the
bargain
reclined
his
head
upon
the
table
and
howled
dismally
very
much
satisfied
with
this
sudden
bringing
down
of
the
youth
s
valour
and
this
effectual
lowering
of
his
tone
pickwick
rang
the
bell
and
was
shown
at
his
own
request
into
a
private
room
furnished
with
a
carpet
table
chairs
sideboard
and
sofa
and
ornamented
with
a
and
various
old
prints
here
he
had
the
advantage
of
hearing
namby
s
performance
on
a
square
piano
overhead
while
the
breakfast
was
getting
ready
when
it
came
perker
came
too
aha
my
dear
sir
said
the
little
man
nailed
at
last
eh
come
come
i
m
not
sorry
for
it
either
because
now
you
ll
see
the
absurdity
of
this
conduct
i
ve
noted
down
the
amount
of
the
taxed
costs
and
damages
for
which
the
was
issued
and
we
had
better
settle
at
once
and
lose
no
time
namby

come
home
by
this
time
i
dare
say
what
say
you
my
dear
sir
shall
i
draw
a
cheque
or
will
you
the
little
man
rubbed
his
hands
with
affected
cheerfulness
as
he
said
this
but
glancing
at
pickwick
s
countenance
could
not
forbear
at
the
same
time
casting
a
desponding
look
towards
sam
weller
perker
said
pickwick
let
me
hear
no
more
of
this
i
beg
i
see
no
advantage
in
staying
here
so
i
shall
go
to
prison
you
can
t
go
to
whitecross
street
my
dear
sir
said
perker
impossible
there
are
sixty
beds
in
a
ward
and
the
bolt
s
on
sixteen
hours
out
of
the
i
would
rather
go
to
some
other
place
of
confinement
if
i
can
said
pickwick
if
not
i
must
make
the
best
i
can
of
you
can
go
to
the
fleet
my
dear
sir
if
you
re
determined
to
go
somewhere
said
perker
that
ll
do
said
pickwick
i
ll
go
there
directly
i
have
finished
my
stop
stop
my
dear
sir
not
the
least
occasion
for
being
in
such
a
violent
hurry
to
get
into
a
place
that
most
other
men
are
as
eager
to
get
out
of
said
the
little
attorney
we
must
have
a
there
ll
be
no
judge
at
chambers
till
four
o
clock
this
afternoon
you
must
wait
till
very
good
said
pickwick
with
unmoved
patience
then
we
will
have
a
chop
here
at
two
see
about
it
sam
and
tell
them
to
be
pickwick
remaining
firm
despite
all
the
remonstrances
and
arguments
of
perker
the
chops
appeared
and
disappeared
in
due
course
he
was
then
put
into
another
hackney
coach
and
carried
off
to
chancery
lane
after
waiting
half
an
hour
or
so
for
namby
who
had
a
select
and
could
on
no
account
be
disturbed
before
there
were
two
judges
in
attendance
at
serjeant
s
inn
one
king
s
bench
and
one
common
pleas
and
a
great
deal
of
business
appeared
to
be
transacting
before
them
if
the
number
of
lawyer
s
clerks
who
were
hurrying
in
and
out
with
bundles
of
papers
afforded
any
test
when
they
reached
the
low
archway
which
forms
the
entrance
to
the
inn
perker
was
detained
a
few
moments
parlaying
with
the
coachman
about
the
fare
and
the
change
and
pickwick
stepping
to
one
side
to
be
out
of
the
way
of
the
stream
of
people
that
were
pouring
in
and
out
looked
about
him
with
some
curiosity
the
people
that
attracted
his
attention
most
were
three
or
four
men
of
appearance
who
touched
their
hats
to
many
of
the
attorneys
who
passed
and
seemed
to
have
some
business
there
the
nature
of
which
pickwick
could
not
divine
they
were
fellows
one
was
a
slim
and
rather
lame
man
in
rusty
black
and
a
white
neckerchief
another
was
a
stout
burly
person
dressed
in
the
same
apparel
with
a
great
cloth
round
his
neck
a
third
was
a
little
weazen
body
with
a
pimply
face
they
were
loitering
about
with
their
hands
behind
them
and
now
and
then
with
an
anxious
countenance
whispered
something
in
the
ear
of
some
of
the
gentlemen
with
papers
as
they
hurried
by
pickwick
remembered
to
have
very
often
observed
them
lounging
under
the
archway
when
he
had
been
walking
past
and
his
curiosity
was
quite
excited
to
know
to
what
branch
of
the
profession
these
loungers
could
possibly
belong
he
was
about
to
propound
the
question
to
namby
who
kept
close
beside
him
sucking
a
large
gold
ring
on
his
little
finger
when
perker
bustled
up
and
observing
that
there
was
no
time
to
lose
led
the
way
into
the
inn
as
pickwick
followed
the
lame
man
stepped
up
to
him
and
civilly
touching
his
hat
held
out
a
written
card
which
pickwick
not
wishing
to
hurt
the
man
s
feelings
by
refusing
courteously
accepted
and
deposited
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
now
said
perker
turning
round
before
he
entered
one
of
the
offices
to
see
that
his
companions
were
close
behind
him
in
here
my
dear
sir
hallo
what
do
you
want
this
last
question
was
addressed
to
the
lame
man
who
unobserved
by
pickwick
made
one
of
the
party
in
reply
to
it
the
lame
man
touched
his
hat
again
with
all
imaginable
politeness
and
motioned
towards
pickwick
no
no
said
perker
with
a
smile
we
don
t
want
you
my
dear
friend
we
don
t
want
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
said
the
lame
man
the
gentleman
took
my
card
i
hope
you
will
employ
me
sir
the
gentleman
nodded
to
me
i
ll
be
judged
by
the
gentleman
himself
you
nodded
to
me
sir
pooh
pooh
nonsense
you
didn
t
nod
to
anybody
pickwick
a
mistake
a
mistake
said
perker
the
gentleman
handed
me
his
card
replied
pickwick
producing
it
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
i
accepted
it
as
the
gentleman
seemed
to
wish
it
in
fact
i
had
some
curiosity
to
look
at
it
when
i
should
be
at
leisure
i
the
little
attorney
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
and
returning
the
card
to
the
lame
man
informing
him
it
was
all
a
mistake
whispered
to
pickwick
as
the
man
turned
away
in
dudgeon
that
he
was
only
a
bail
a
what
exclaimed
pickwick
a
bail
replied
perker
a
bail
yes
my
dear
sir
half
a
dozen
of
em
here
bail
you
to
any
amount
and
only
charge
half
a
crown
curious
trade
isn
t
it
said
perker
regaling
himself
with
a
pinch
of
snuff
what
am
i
to
understand
that
these
men
earn
a
livelihood
by
waiting
about
here
to
perjure
themselves
before
the
judges
of
the
land
at
the
rate
of
half
a
crown
a
crime
exclaimed
pickwick
quite
aghast
at
the
disclosure
why
i
don
t
exactly
know
about
perjury
my
dear
sir
replied
the
little
gentleman
harsh
word
my
dear
sir
very
harsh
word
indeed
it
s
a
legal
fiction
my
dear
sir
nothing
saying
which
the
attorney
shrugged
his
shoulders
smiled
took
a
second
pinch
of
snuff
and
led
the
way
into
the
office
of
the
judge
s
clerk
this
was
a
room
of
specially
dirty
appearance
with
a
very
low
ceiling
and
old
panelled
walls
and
so
badly
lighted
that
although
it
was
broad
day
outside
great
tallow
candles
were
burning
on
the
desks
at
one
end
was
a
door
leading
to
the
judge
s
private
apartment
round
which
were
congregated
a
crowd
of
attorneys
and
managing
clerks
who
were
called
in
in
the
order
in
which
their
respective
appointments
stood
upon
the
file
every
time
this
door
was
opened
to
let
a
party
out
the
next
party
made
a
violent
rush
to
get
in
and
as
in
addition
to
the
numerous
dialogues
which
passed
between
the
gentlemen
who
were
waiting
to
see
the
judge
a
variety
of
personal
squabbles
ensued
between
the
greater
part
of
those
who
had
seen
him
there
was
as
much
noise
as
could
well
be
raised
in
an
apartment
of
such
confined
dimensions
nor
were
the
conversations
of
these
gentlemen
the
only
sounds
that
broke
upon
the
ear
standing
on
a
box
behind
a
wooden
bar
at
another
end
of
the
room
was
a
clerk
in
spectacles
who
was
taking
the
affidavits
large
batches
of
which
were
from
time
to
time
carried
into
the
private
room
by
another
clerk
for
the
judge
s
signature
there
were
a
large
number
of
attorneys
clerks
to
be
sworn
and
it
being
a
moral
impossibility
to
swear
them
all
at
once
the
struggles
of
these
gentlemen
to
reach
the
clerk
in
spectacles
were
like
those
of
a
crowd
to
get
in
at
the
pit
door
of
a
theatre
when
gracious
majesty
honours
it
with
its
presence
another
functionary
from
time
to
time
exercised
his
lungs
in
calling
over
the
names
of
those
who
had
been
sworn
for
the
purpose
of
restoring
to
them
their
affidavits
after
they
had
been
signed
by
the
judge
which
gave
rise
to
a
few
more
scuffles
and
all
these
things
going
on
at
the
same
time
occasioned
as
much
bustle
as
the
most
active
and
excitable
person
could
desire
to
behold
there
were
yet
another
class
of
persons
those
who
were
waiting
to
attend
summonses
their
employers
had
taken
out
which
it
was
optional
to
the
attorney
on
the
opposite
side
to
attend
or
not
and
whose
business
it
was
from
time
to
time
to
cry
out
the
opposite
attorney
s
name
to
make
certain
that
he
was
not
in
attendance
without
their
knowledge
for
example
leaning
against
the
wall
close
beside
the
seat
pickwick
had
taken
was
an
of
fourteen
with
a
tenor
voice
near
him
a
clerk
with
a
bass
one
a
clerk
hurried
in
with
a
bundle
of
papers
and
stared
about
him
sniggle
and
blink
cried
the
tenor
porkin
and
snob
growled
the
bass
stumpy
and
deacon
said
the
nobody
answered
the
next
man
who
came
in
was
bailed
by
the
whole
three
and
he
in
his
turn
shouted
for
another
firm
and
then
somebody
else
roared
in
a
loud
voice
for
another
and
so
forth
all
this
time
the
man
in
the
spectacles
was
hard
at
work
swearing
the
clerks
the
oath
being
invariably
administered
without
any
effort
at
punctuation
and
usually
in
the
following
terms
take
the
book
in
your
right
hand
this
is
your
name
and
you
swear
that
the
contents
of
this
your
affidavit
are
true
so
help

a
shilling

must
get

pickwick

by
this
what
sort
of
cumbrous
and
unmanageable
machine
sam
weller
imagined
a
to
be
does
not
appear
for
perker
at
that
moment
walked
up
and
took
pickwick
away
the
usual
forms
having
been
gone
through
the
body
of
samuel
pickwick
was
soon
afterwards
confided
to
the
custody
of
the
tipstaff
to
be
by
him
taken
to
the
warden
of
the
fleet
prison
and
there
detained
until
the
amount
of
the
damages
and
costs
in
the
action
of
bardell
against
pickwick
was
fully
paid
and
satisfied
and
that
said
pickwick
laughing
will
be
a
very
long
time
sam
call
another
perker
my
dear
friend
i
shall
go
with
you
and

said
perker
indeed
replied
pickwick
i
would
rather
go
without
any
other
attendant
than
sam
as
soon
as
i
get
settled
i
will
write
and
let
you
know
and
i
shall
expect
you
immediately
until
then
as
pickwick
said
this
he
got
into
the
coach
which
had
by
this
time
arrived
followed
by
the
tipstaff
sam
having
stationed
himself
on
the
box
it
rolled
away
a
most
extraordinary
man
that
said
perker
as
he
stopped
to
pull
on
his
gloves
what
a
bankrupt
he
d
make
sir
observed
lowten
who
was
standing
near
how
he
would
bother
the
commissioners
he
d
set
em
at
defiance
if
they
talked
of
committing
him
the
attorney
did
not
appear
very
much
delighted
with
his
clerk
s
professional
estimate
of
pickwick
s
character
for
he
walked
away
without
deigning
any
reply
the
jolted
along
fleet
street
as
usually
do
the
horses
went
better
the
driver
said
when
they
had
anything
before
them
they
must
have
gone
at
a
most
extraordinary
pace
when
there
was
nothing
and
so
the
vehicle
kept
behind
a
cart
when
the
cart
stopped
it
stopped
and
when
the
cart
went
on
again
it
did
the
same
pickwick
sat
opposite
the
tipstaff
and
the
tipstaff
sat
with
his
hat
between
his
knees
whistling
a
tune
and
looking
out
of
the
coach
window
time
performs
wonders
by
the
powerful
old
gentleman
s
aid
even
a
gets
over
half
a
mile
of
ground
they
stopped
at
length
and
pickwick
alighted
at
the
gate
of
the
fleet
the
tipstaff
just
looking
over
his
shoulder
to
see
that
his
charge
was
following
close
at
his
heels
preceded
pickwick
into
the
prison
turning
to
the
left
after
they
had
entered
they
passed
through
an
open
door
into
a
lobby
from
which
a
heavy
gate
opposite
to
that
by
which
they
had
entered
and
which
was
guarded
by
a
stout
turnkey
with
the
key
in
his
hand
led
at
once
into
the
interior
of
the
prison
here
they
stopped
while
the
tipstaff
delivered
his
papers
and
here
pickwick
was
apprised
that
he
would
remain
until
he
had
undergone
the
ceremony
known
to
the
initiated
as
sitting
for
your
sitting
for
my
portrait
said
pickwick
having
your
likeness
taken
sir
replied
the
stout
turnkey
we
re
capital
hands
at
likenesses
here
take
em
in
no
time
and
always
exact
walk
in
sir
and
make
yourself
at
pickwick
complied
with
the
invitation
and
sat
himself
down
when
weller
who
stationed
himself
at
the
back
of
the
chair
whispered
that
the
sitting
was
merely
another
term
for
undergoing
an
inspection
by
the
different
turnkeys
in
order
that
they
might
know
prisoners
from
visitors
well
sam
said
pickwick
then
i
wish
the
artists
would
come
this
is
rather
a
public
they
von
t
be
long
sir
i
replied
sam
there
s
a
dutch
clock
so
i
see
observed
pickwick
and
a
sir
says
sam
veels
vithin
veels
a
prison
in
a
prison
ain
t
it
sir
as
weller
made
this
philosophical
remark
pickwick
was
aware
that
his
sitting
had
commenced
the
stout
turnkey
having
been
relieved
from
the
lock
sat
down
and
looked
at
him
carelessly
from
time
to
time
while
a
long
thin
man
who
had
relieved
him
thrust
his
hands
beneath
his
coat
tails
and
planting
himself
opposite
took
a
good
long
view
of
him
a
third
rather
gentleman
who
had
apparently
been
disturbed
at
his
tea
for
he
was
disposing
of
the
last
remnant
of
a
crust
and
butter
when
he
came
in
stationed
himself
close
to
pickwick
and
resting
his
hands
on
his
hips
inspected
him
narrowly
while
two
others
mixed
with
the
group
and
studied
his
features
with
most
intent
and
thoughtful
faces
pickwick
winced
a
good
deal
under
the
operation
and
appeared
to
sit
very
uneasily
in
his
chair
but
he
made
no
remark
to
anybody
while
it
was
being
performed
not
even
to
sam
who
reclined
upon
the
back
of
the
chair
reflecting
partly
on
the
situation
of
his
master
and
partly
on
the
great
satisfaction
it
would
have
afforded
him
to
make
a
fierce
assault
upon
all
the
turnkeys
there
assembled
one
after
the
other
if
it
were
lawful
and
peaceable
so
to
do
at
length
the
likeness
was
completed
and
pickwick
was
informed
that
he
might
now
proceed
into
the
prison
where
am
i
to
sleep
inquired
pickwick
why
i
don
t
rightly
know
about
replied
the
stout
turnkey
you
ll
be
chummed
on
somebody
and
then
you
ll
be
all
snug
and
comfortable
the
first
night
s
generally
rather
unsettled
but
you
ll
be
set
all
squares
after
some
discussion
it
was
discovered
that
one
of
the
turnkeys
had
a
bed
to
let
which
pickwick
could
have
for
that
night
he
gladly
agreed
to
hire
it
if
you
ll
come
with
me
i
ll
show
it
you
at
once
said
the
man
it
ain
t
a
large
un
but
it
s
an
to
sleep
in
this
way
they
passed
through
the
inner
gate
and
descended
a
short
flight
of
steps
the
key
was
turned
after
them
and
pickwick
found
himself
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
within
the
walls
of
a
debtors
prison
chapter
xli
what
befell
pickwick
when
he
got
into
the
fleet
what
prisoners
he
saw
there
and
how
he
passed
the
night
tom
roker
the
gentleman
who
had
accompanied
pickwick
into
the
prison
turned
sharp
round
to
the
right
when
he
got
to
the
bottom
of
the
little
flight
of
steps
and
led
the
way
through
an
iron
gate
which
stood
open
and
up
another
short
flight
of
steps
into
a
long
narrow
gallery
dirty
and
low
paved
with
stone
and
very
dimly
lighted
by
a
window
at
each
remote
end
this
said
the
gentleman
thrusting
his
hands
into
his
pockets
and
looking
carelessly
over
his
shoulder
to
pickwick
this
here
is
the
hall
oh
replied
pickwick
looking
down
a
dark
and
filthy
staircase
which
appeared
to
lead
to
a
range
of
damp
and
gloomy
stone
vaults
beneath
the
ground
and
those
i
suppose
are
the
little
cellars
where
the
prisoners
keep
their
small
quantities
of
coals
unpleasant
places
to
have
to
go
down
to
but
very
convenient
i
dare
yes
i
shouldn
t
wonder
if
they
was
convenient
replied
the
gentleman
seeing
that
a
few
people
live
there
pretty
snug
that
s
the
fair
that
my
friend
said
pickwick
you
don
t
really
mean
to
say
that
human
beings
live
down
in
those
wretched
dungeons
don
t
i
replied
roker
with
indignant
astonishment
why
shouldn
t
i
live
live
down
there
exclaimed
pickwick
live
down
there
yes
and
die
down
there
too
very
often
replied
roker
and
what
of
that
who
s
got
to
say
anything
agin
it
live
down
there
yes
and
a
wery
good
place
it
is
to
live
in
ain
t
it
as
roker
turned
somewhat
fiercely
upon
pickwick
in
saying
this
and
moreover
muttered
in
an
excited
fashion
certain
unpleasant
invocations
concerning
his
own
eyes
limbs
and
circulating
fluids
the
latter
gentleman
deemed
it
advisable
to
pursue
the
discourse
no
further
roker
then
proceeded
to
mount
another
staircase
as
dirty
as
that
which
led
to
the
place
which
has
just
been
the
subject
of
discussion
in
which
ascent
he
was
closely
followed
by
pickwick
and
sam
there
said
roker
pausing
for
breath
when
they
reached
another
gallery
of
the
same
dimensions
as
the
one
below
this
is
the
room
flight
the
one
above
s
the
third
and
the
one
above
that
s
the
top
and
the
room
where
you
re
to
sleep
is
the
warden
s
room
and
it
s
this
way
come
having
said
all
this
in
a
breath
roker
mounted
another
flight
of
stairs
with
pickwick
and
sam
weller
following
at
his
heels
these
staircases
received
light
from
sundry
windows
placed
at
some
little
distance
above
the
floor
and
looking
into
a
gravelled
area
bounded
by
a
high
brick
wall
with
iron
at
the
top
this
area
it
appeared
from
roker
s
statement
was
the
ground
and
it
further
appeared
on
the
testimony
of
the
same
gentleman
that
there
was
a
smaller
area
in
that
portion
of
the
prison
which
was
nearest
farringdon
street
denominated
and
called
the
painted
ground
from
the
fact
of
its
walls
having
once
displayed
the
semblance
of
various
in
full
sail
and
other
artistical
effects
achieved
in
bygone
times
by
some
imprisoned
draughtsman
in
his
leisure
hours
having
communicated
this
piece
of
information
apparently
more
for
the
purpose
of
discharging
his
bosom
of
an
important
fact
than
with
any
specific
view
of
enlightening
pickwick
the
guide
having
at
length
reached
another
gallery
led
the
way
into
a
small
passage
at
the
extreme
end
opened
a
door
and
disclosed
an
apartment
of
an
appearance
by
no
means
inviting
containing
eight
or
nine
iron
bedsteads
there
said
roker
holding
the
door
open
and
looking
triumphantly
round
at
pickwick
there
s
a
room
pickwick
s
face
however
betokened
such
a
very
trifling
portion
of
satisfaction
at
the
appearance
of
his
lodging
that
roker
looked
for
a
reciprocity
of
feeling
into
the
countenance
of
samuel
weller
who
until
now
had
observed
a
dignified
silence
there
s
a
room
young
man
observed
roker
i
see
it
replied
sam
with
a
placid
nod
of
the
head
you
wouldn
t
think
to
find
such
a
room
as
this
in
the
farringdon
hotel
would
you
said
roker
with
a
complacent
smile
to
this
weller
replied
with
an
easy
and
unstudied
closing
of
one
eye
which
might
be
considered
to
mean
either
that
he
would
have
thought
it
or
that
he
would
not
have
thought
it
or
that
he
had
never
thought
anything
at
all
about
it
as
the
observer
s
imagination
suggested
having
executed
this
feat
and
reopened
his
eye
weller
proceeded
to
inquire
which
was
the
individual
bedstead
that
roker
had
so
flatteringly
described
as
an
to
sleep
in
that
s
it
replied
roker
pointing
to
a
very
rusty
one
in
a
corner
it
would
make
any
one
go
to
sleep
that
bedstead
would
whether
they
wanted
to
or
i
should
think
said
sam
eyeing
the
piece
of
furniture
in
question
with
a
look
of
excessive
disgust
i
should
think
poppies
was
nothing
to
nothing
at
all
said
roker
and
i
s
pose
said
sam
with
a
sidelong
glance
at
his
master
as
if
to
see
whether
there
were
any
symptoms
of
his
determination
being
shaken
by
what
passed
i
s
pose
the
other
gen
l
men
as
sleeps
here
l
nothing
but
it
said
roker
one
of
em
takes
his
twelve
pints
of
ale
a
day
and
never
leaves
off
smoking
even
at
his
he
must
be
a
said
sam
replied
roker
nothing
daunted
even
by
this
intelligence
pickwick
smilingly
announced
his
determination
to
test
the
powers
of
the
narcotic
bedstead
for
that
night
and
roker
after
informing
him
that
he
could
retire
to
rest
at
whatever
hour
he
thought
proper
without
any
further
notice
or
formality
walked
off
leaving
him
standing
with
sam
in
the
gallery
it
was
getting
dark
that
is
to
say
a
few
gas
jets
were
kindled
in
this
place
which
was
never
light
by
way
of
compliment
to
the
evening
which
had
set
in
outside
as
it
was
rather
warm
some
of
the
tenants
of
the
numerous
little
rooms
which
opened
into
the
gallery
on
either
hand
had
set
their
doors
ajar
pickwick
peeped
into
them
as
he
passed
along
with
great
curiosity
and
interest
here
four
or
five
great
hulking
fellows
just
visible
through
a
cloud
of
tobacco
smoke
were
engaged
in
noisy
and
riotous
conversation
over
pots
of
beer
or
playing
at
with
a
very
greasy
pack
of
cards
in
the
adjoining
room
some
solitary
tenant
might
be
seen
poring
by
the
light
of
a
feeble
tallow
candle
over
a
bundle
of
soiled
and
tattered
papers
yellow
with
dust
and
dropping
to
pieces
from
age
writing
for
the
hundredth
time
some
lengthened
statement
of
his
grievances
for
the
perusal
of
some
great
man
whose
eyes
it
would
never
reach
or
whose
heart
it
would
never
touch
in
a
third
a
man
with
his
wife
and
a
whole
crowd
of
children
might
be
seen
making
up
a
scanty
bed
on
the
ground
or
upon
a
few
chairs
for
the
younger
ones
to
pass
the
night
in
and
in
a
fourth
and
a
fifth
and
a
sixth
and
a
seventh
the
noise
and
the
beer
and
the
tobacco
smoke
and
the
cards
all
came
over
again
in
greater
force
than
before
in
the
galleries
themselves
and
more
especially
on
the
there
lingered
a
great
number
of
people
who
came
there
some
because
their
rooms
were
empty
and
lonesome
others
because
their
rooms
were
full
and
hot
the
greater
part
because
they
were
restless
and
uncomfortable
and
not
possessed
of
the
secret
of
exactly
knowing
what
to
do
with
themselves
there
were
many
classes
of
people
here
from
the
labouring
man
in
his
fustian
jacket
to
the
spendthrift
in
his
shawl
most
appropriately
out
at
elbows
but
there
was
the
same
air
about
them
all
a
kind
of
listless
careless
swagger
a
vagabondish
who
sort
of
bearing
which
is
wholly
indescribable
in
words
but
which
any
man
can
understand
in
one
moment
if
he
wish
by
setting
foot
in
the
nearest
debtors
prison
and
looking
at
the
very
first
group
of
people
he
sees
there
with
the
same
interest
as
pickwick
did
it
strikes
me
sam
said
pickwick
leaning
over
the
iron
rail
at
the
it
strikes
me
sam
that
imprisonment
for
debt
is
scarcely
any
punishment
at
think
not
sir
inquired
weller
you
see
how
these
fellows
drink
and
smoke
and
roar
replied
pickwick
it
s
quite
impossible
that
they
can
mind
it
ah
that
s
just
the
wery
thing
sir
rejoined
sam
they
don
t
mind
it
it

grog

made
it

unekal
and
that
s
the
fault
on
i
think
you
re
right
sam
said
pickwick
after
a
few
moments
reflection
quite
p
raps
now
and
then
there
s
some
honest
people
as
likes
it
observed
weller
in
a
ruminative
tone
but
i
never
heerd
o
one
as
i
can
call
to
mind
cept
the
little
man
in
the
brown
coat
and
that

of
and
who

inquired
pickwick
wy

sam
but
what

pickwick

in
consekens

t
much

for
nine
pound
nothin
multiplied
by
five
for

but
hows

for
seventeen
year
if
he
got
any
wrinkles
in
his
face
they
were
stopped
up
vith
the
dirt
for
both
the
dirty
face
and
the
brown
coat
wos
just
the
same
at
the
end
o

time
as

fierce
and
making
believe

t

to
wot

little
man

says
the
little
man
more
abrupt
than
afore
i
ve
got
the
fancy
in
my
head
let
me
see
the
public
streets
once
more
afore
i

and
if

with
apoplexy
i

minits

he
says
no

and
that
wos
true
sure
enough
for
wen
he
wanted
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
any
he
used
to
pull
out
a
little
limp
card
vith
them
words
on
it
and
nothin
else
in
consideration
of
vich
he
vos
alvays
called

tventy
the
turnkey
takes
a
fixed
look
at
him
and
at
last
he
says
in
a
solemn
manner
tventy
he
says
i
ll
trust
you

t
get
your
old
friend

my
boy

hope

better

says
the
little
man
and
as
he
said
it
he
hit
his
little
vesket
wery
hard
and
then
a
tear
started
out
o
each
eye
which
wos
wery
extraordinary
for
it
wos
supposed
as
water
never
touched
his
face
he
shook
the
turnkey
by
the
hand
out
he
vent
and
never
came
back
again
said
pickwick
wrong
for
vunce
sir
replied
weller
for
back
he
come
two
minits
afore
the
time
with
rage
sayin
how
he
d
been
nearly
run
over
by
a
that
he
warn
t
used
to
it
and
he
was
blowed
if
he
wouldn
t
write
to
the
lord
mayor
they
got
him
pacified
at
last
and
for
five
years
arter
that
he
never
even
so
much
as
peeped
out
o
the
lodge
at
the
expiration
of
that
time
he
died
i
suppose
said
pickwick
no
he
didn
t
sir
replied
sam
he
got
a
curiosity
to
go
and
taste
the
beer
at
a
new
over
the
way
and
it
wos
such
a
wery
nice
parlour
that
he
took
it
into
his
head
to
go
there
every
night
which
he
did
for
a
long
time
always
comin
back
reg
lar
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
afore
the
gate
shut
which
was
all
wery
snug
and
comfortable
at
last
he
began
to
get
so
precious
jolly
that
he
used
to
forget
how
the
time
vent
or
care
nothin
at
all
about
it
and
he
went
on
gettin
later
and
later
till
vun
night
his
old
friend
wos
just
the
gate
had
turned
the
key
in
fact
wen
he
come
up
hold
hard
bill
he
says
wot
ain
t
you
come
home
yet
tventy
says
the
turnkey
i
thought
you
wos
in
long
no
i
wasn
t
says
the
little
man
with
a
smile
well
then
i
ll
tell
you
wot
it
is
my
friend
says
the
turnkey
openin
the
gate
wery
slow
and
sulky
it
s
my
pinion
as
you
ve
got
into
bad
company
o
late
which
i
m
wery
sorry
to
see
now
i
don
t
wish
to
do
nothing
harsh
he
says
but
if
you
can
t
confine
yourself
to
steady
circles
and
find
your
vay
back
at
reg
lar
hours
as
sure
as
you
re
there
i
ll
shut
you
out
altogether
the
little
man
was
seized
vith
a
wiolent
fit
o
tremblin
and
never
vent
outside
the
prison
walls
artervards
as
sam
concluded
pickwick
slowly
retraced
his
steps
downstairs
after
a
few
thoughtful
turns
in
the
painted
ground
which
as
it
was
now
dark
was
nearly
deserted
he
intimated
to
weller
that
he
thought
it
high
time
for
him
to
withdraw
for
the
night
requesting
him
to
seek
a
bed
in
some
adjacent
and
return
early
in
the
morning
to
make
arrangements
for
the
removal
of
his
master
s
wardrobe
from
the
george
and
vulture
this
request
samuel
weller
prepared
to
obey
with
as
good
a
grace
as
he
could
assume
but
with
a
very
considerable
show
of
reluctance
nevertheless
he
even
went
so
far
as
to
essay
sundry
ineffectual
hints
regarding
the
expediency
of
stretching
himself
on
the
gravel
for
that
night
but
finding
pickwick
obstinately
deaf
to
any
such
suggestions
finally
withdrew
there
is
no
disguising
the
fact
that
pickwick
felt
very
and
uncomfortable
not
for
lack
of
society
for
the
prison
was
very
full
and
a
bottle
of
wine
would
at
once
have
purchased
the
utmost
fellowship
of
a
few
choice
spirits
without
any
more
formal
ceremony
of
introduction
but
he
was
alone
in
the
coarse
vulgar
crowd
and
felt
the
depression
of
spirits
and
sinking
of
heart
naturally
consequent
on
the
reflection
that
he
was
cooped
and
caged
up
without
a
prospect
of
liberation
as
to
the
idea
of
releasing
himself
by
ministering
to
the
sharpness
of
dodson
fogg
it
never
for
an
instant
entered
his
thoughts
in
this
frame
of
mind
he
turned
again
into
the
gallery
and
walked
slowly
to
and
fro
the
place
was
intolerably
dirty
and
the
smell
of
tobacco
smoke
perfectly
suffocating
there
was
a
perpetual
slamming
and
banging
of
doors
as
the
people
went
in
and
out
and
the
noise
of
their
voices
and
footsteps
echoed
and
through
the
passages
constantly
a
young
woman
with
a
child
in
her
arms
who
seemed
scarcely
able
to
crawl
from
emaciation
and
misery
was
walking
up
and
down
the
passage
in
conversation
with
her
husband
who
had
no
other
place
to
see
her
in
as
they
passed
pickwick
he
could
hear
the
female
sob
bitterly
and
once
she
burst
into
such
a
passion
of
grief
that
she
was
compelled
to
lean
against
the
wall
for
support
while
the
man
took
the
child
in
his
arms
and
tried
to
soothe
her
pickwick
s
heart
was
really
too
full
to
bear
it
and
he
went
upstairs
to
bed
now
although
the
warder
s
room
was
a
very
uncomfortable
one
being
in
every
point
of
decoration
and
convenience
several
hundred
degrees
inferior
to
the
common
infirmary
of
a
county
jail
it
had
at
present
the
merit
of
being
wholly
deserted
save
by
pickwick
himself
so
he
sat
down
at
the
foot
of
his
little
iron
bedstead
and
began
to
wonder
how
much
a
year
the
warder
made
out
of
the
dirty
room
having
satisfied
himself
by
mathematical
calculation
that
the
apartment
was
about
equal
in
annual
value
to
the
freehold
of
a
small
street
in
the
suburbs
of
london
he
took
to
wondering
what
possible
temptation
could
have
induced
a
fly
that
was
crawling
over
his
pantaloons
to
come
into
a
close
prison
when
he
had
the
choice
of
so
many
airy
situations
a
course
of
meditation
which
led
him
to
the
irresistible
conclusion
that
the
insect
was
insane
after
settling
this
point
he
began
to
be
conscious
that
he
was
getting
sleepy
whereupon
he
took
his
nightcap
out
of
the
pocket
in
which
he
had
had
the
precaution
to
stow
it
in
the
morning
and
leisurely
undressing
himself
got
into
bed
and
fell
asleep
bravo
heel
over
toe
cut
and
shuffle
pay
away
at
it
zephyr
i
m
smothered
if
the
opera
house
isn
t
your
proper
hemisphere
keep
it
up
hooray
these
expressions
delivered
in
a
most
boisterous
tone
and
accompanied
with
loud
peals
of
laughter
roused
pickwick
from
one
of
those
sound
slumbers
which
lasting
in
reality
some
seem
to
the
sleeper
to
have
been
protracted
for
three
weeks
or
a
month
the
voice
had
no
sooner
ceased
than
the
room
was
shaken
with
such
violence
that
the
windows
rattled
in
their
frames
and
the
bedsteads
trembled
again
pickwick
started
up
and
remained
for
some
minutes
fixed
in
mute
astonishment
at
the
scene
before
him
on
the
floor
of
the
room
a
man
in
a
green
coat
with
corduroy
and
gray
cotton
stockings
was
performing
the
most
popular
steps
of
a
hornpipe
with
a
slang
and
burlesque
caricature
of
grace
and
lightness
which
combined
with
the
very
appropriate
character
of
his
costume
was
inexpressibly
absurd
another
man
evidently
very
drunk
who
had
probably
been
tumbled
into
bed
by
his
companions
was
sitting
up
between
the
sheets
warbling
as
much
as
he
could
recollect
of
a
comic
song
with
the
most
intensely
sentimental
feeling
and
expression
while
a
third
seated
on
one
of
the
bedsteads
was
applauding
both
performers
with
the
air
of
a
profound
connoisseur
and
encouraging
them
by
such
ebullitions
of
feeling
as
had
already
roused
pickwick
from
his
sleep
this
last
man
was
an
admirable
specimen
of
a
class
of
gentry
which
never
can
be
seen
in
full
perfection
but
in
such
places
they
may
be
met
with
in
an
imperfect
state
occasionally
about
and
houses
but
they
never
attain
their
full
bloom
except
in
these
which
would
almost
seem
to
be
considerately
provided
by
the
legislature
for
the
sole
purpose
of
rearing
them
he
was
a
tall
fellow
with
an
olive
complexion
long
dark
hair
and
very
thick
bushy
whiskers
meeting
under
his
chin
he
wore
no
neckerchief
as
he
had
been
playing
rackets
all
day
and
his
open
shirt
collar
displayed
their
full
luxuriance
on
his
head
he
wore
one
of
the
common
eighteenpenny
french
with
a
gaudy
tassel
dangling
therefrom
very
happily
in
keeping
with
a
common
fustian
coat
his
legs
which
being
long
were
afflicted
with
weakness
graced
a
pair
of
mixture
trousers
made
to
show
the
full
symmetry
of
those
limbs
being
somewhat
negligently
braced
however
and
moreover
but
imperfectly
buttoned
they
fell
in
a
series
of
not
the
most
graceful
folds
over
a
pair
of
shoes
sufficiently
down
at
heel
to
display
a
pair
of
very
soiled
white
stockings
there
was
a
rakish
vagabond
smartness
and
a
kind
of
boastful
rascality
about
the
whole
man
that
was
worth
a
mine
of
gold
this
figure
was
the
first
to
perceive
that
pickwick
was
looking
on
upon
which
he
winked
to
the
zephyr
and
entreated
him
with
mock
gravity
not
to
wake
the
gentleman
why
bless
the
gentleman
s
honest
heart
and
soul
said
the
zephyr
turning
round
and
affecting
the
extremity
of
surprise
the
gentleman
is
awake
hem
shakespeare
how
do
you
do
sir
how
is
mary
and
sarah
sir
and
the
dear
old
lady
at
home
sir
will
you
have
the
kindness
to
put
my
compliments
into
the
first
little
parcel
you
re
sending
that
way
sir
and
say
that
i
would
have
sent
em
before
only
i
was
afraid
they
might
be
broken
in
the
wagon
sir
don
t
overwhelm
the
gentlemen
with
ordinary
civilities
when
you
see
he
s
anxious
to
have
something
to
drink
said
the
gentleman
with
the
whiskers
with
a
jocose
air
why
don
t
you
ask
the
gentleman
what
he
ll
take
dear
me
i
quite
forgot
replied
the
other
what
will
you
take
sir
will
you
take
port
wine
sir
or
sherry
wine
sir
i
can
recommend
the
ale
sir
or
perhaps
you
d
like
to
taste
the
porter
sir
allow
me
to
have
the
felicity
of
hanging
up
your
nightcap
with
this
the
speaker
snatched
that
article
of
dress
from
pickwick
s
head
and
fixed
it
in
a
twinkling
on
that
of
the
drunken
man
who
firmly
impressed
with
the
belief
that
he
was
delighting
a
numerous
assembly
continued
to
hammer
away
at
the
comic
song
in
the
most
melancholy
strains
imaginable
taking
a
man
s
nightcap
from
his
brow
by
violent
means
and
adjusting
it
on
the
head
of
an
unknown
gentleman
of
dirty
exterior
however
ingenious
a
witticism
in
itself
is
unquestionably
one
of
those
which
come
under
the
denomination
of
practical
jokes
viewing
the
matter
precisely
in
this
light
pickwick
without
the
slightest
intimation
of
his
purpose
sprang
vigorously
out
of
bed
struck
the
zephyr
so
smart
a
blow
in
the
chest
as
to
deprive
him
of
a
considerable
portion
of
the
commodity
which
sometimes
bears
his
name
and
then
recapturing
his
nightcap
boldly
placed
himself
in
an
attitude
of
defence
now
said
pickwick
gasping
no
less
from
excitement
than
from
the
expenditure
of
so
much
energy
come
on
both
of
you
both
of
you
with
this
liberal
invitation
the
worthy
gentleman
communicated
a
revolving
motion
to
his
clenched
fists
by
way
of
appalling
his
antagonists
with
a
display
of
science
it
might
have
been
pickwick
s
very
unexpected
gallantry
or
it
might
have
been
the
complicated
manner
in
which
he
had
got
himself
out
of
bed
and
fallen
all
in
a
mass
upon
the
hornpipe
man
that
touched
his
adversaries
touched
they
were
for
instead
of
then
and
there
making
an
attempt
to
commit
as
pickwick
implicitly
believed
they
would
have
done
they
paused
stared
at
each
other
a
short
time
and
finally
laughed
outright
well
you
re
a
trump
and
i
like
you
all
the
better
for
it
said
the
zephyr
now
jump
into
bed
again
or
you
ll
catch
the
rheumatics
no
malice
i
hope
said
the
man
extending
a
hand
the
size
of
the
yellow
clump
of
fingers
which
sometimes
swings
over
a
glover
s
door
certainly
not
said
pickwick
with
great
alacrity
for
now
that
the
excitement
was
over
he
began
to
feel
rather
cool
about
the
legs
allow
me
the
said
the
gentleman
with
the
whiskers
presenting
his
dexter
hand
and
aspirating
the
with
much
pleasure
sir
said
pickwick
and
having
executed
a
very
long
and
solemn
shake
he
got
into
bed
again
my
name
is
smangle
sir
said
the
man
with
the
whiskers
oh
said
pickwick
mine
is
mivins
said
the
man
in
the
stockings
i
am
delighted
to
hear
it
sir
said
pickwick
hem
coughed
smangle
did
you
speak
sir
said
pickwick
no
i
did
not
sir
said
smangle
all
this
was
very
genteel
and
pleasant
and
to
make
matters
still
more
comfortable
smangle
assured
pickwick
a
great
many
more
times
that
he
entertained
a
very
high
respect
for
the
feelings
of
a
gentleman
which
sentiment
indeed
did
him
infinite
credit
as
he
could
be
in
no
wise
supposed
to
understand
them
are
you
going
through
the
court
sir
inquired
smangle
through
the
what
said
pickwick
through
the
court
portugal
street
the
court
for
relief
of
you
oh
no
replied
pickwick
no
i
am
going
out
perhaps
suggested
mivins
i
fear
not
replied
pickwick
i
refuse
to
pay
some
damages
and
am
here
in
ah
said
smangle
paper
has
been
my
a
stationer
i
presume
sir
said
pickwick
innocently
stationer
no
no
confound
and
curse
me
not
so
low
as
that
no
trade
when
i
say
paper
i
mean
oh
you
use
the
word
in
that
sense
i
see
said
pickwick
damme
a
gentleman
must
expect
reverses
said
smangle
what
of
that
here
am
i
in
the
fleet
prison
well
good
what
then
i
m
none
the
worse
for
that
am
i
not
a
bit
replied
mivins
and
he
was
quite
right
for
so
far
from
smangle
being
any
the
worse
for
it
he
was
something
the
better
inasmuch
as
to
qualify
himself
for
the
place
he
had
attained
gratuitous
possession
of
certain
articles
of
jewellery
which
long
before
that
had
found
their
way
to
the
pawnbroker
s
well
but
come
said
smangle
this
is
dry
work
let
s
rinse
our
mouths
with
a
drop
of
burnt
sherry
the
shall
stand
it
mivins
shall
fetch
it
and
i
ll
help
to
drink
it
that
s
a
fair
and
gentlemanlike
division
of
labour
anyhow
curse
me
unwilling
to
hazard
another
quarrel
pickwick
gladly
assented
to
the
proposition
and
consigned
the
money
to
mivins
who
as
it
was
nearly
eleven
o
clock
lost
no
time
in
repairing
to
the
on
his
errand
i
say
whispered
smangle
the
moment
his
friend
had
left
the
room
what
did
you
give
him
half
a
sovereign
said
pickwick
he
s
a
devilish
pleasant
gentlemanly
dog
said
smangle
infernal
pleasant
i
don
t
know
anybody
more
so
but
here
smangle
stopped
short
and
shook
his
head
dubiously
you
don
t
think
there
is
any
probability
of
his
appropriating
the
money
to
his
own
use
said
pickwick
oh
no
mind
i
don
t
say
that
i
expressly
say
that
he
s
a
devilish
gentlemanly
fellow
said
smangle
but
i
think
perhaps
if
somebody
went
down
just
to
see
that
he
didn
t
dip
his
beak
into
the
jug
by
accident
or
make
some
confounded
mistake
in
losing
the
money
as
he
came
upstairs
it
would
be
as
well
here
you
sir
just
run
downstairs
and
look
after
that
gentleman
will
you
this
request
was
addressed
to
a
little
nervous
man
whose
appearance
bespoke
great
poverty
and
who
had
been
crouching
on
his
bedstead
all
this
while
apparently
stupefied
by
the
novelty
of
his
situation
you
know
where
the
is
said
smangle
just
run
down
and
tell
that
gentleman
you
ve
come
to
help
him
up
with
the
jug
or
stop
i
ll
tell
you
what
i
ll
tell
you
how
we
ll
do
him
said
smangle
with
a
cunning
look
how
said
pickwick
send
down
word
that
he
s
to
spend
the
change
in
cigars
capital
thought
run
and
tell
him
that
d
ye
hear
they
shan
t
be
wasted
continued
smangle
turning
to
pickwick
smoke
this
manoeuvring
was
so
exceedingly
ingenious
and
withal
performed
with
such
immovable
composure
and
coolness
that
pickwick
would
have
had
no
wish
to
disturb
it
even
if
he
had
had
the
power
in
a
short
time
mivins
returned
bearing
the
sherry
which
smangle
dispensed
in
two
little
cracked
mugs
considerately
remarking
with
reference
to
himself
that
a
gentleman
must
not
be
particular
under
such
circumstances
and
that
for
his
part
he
was
not
too
proud
to
drink
out
of
the
jug
in
which
to
show
his
sincerity
he
forthwith
pledged
the
company
in
a
draught
which
half
emptied
it
an
excellent
understanding
having
been
by
these
means
promoted
smangle
proceeded
to
entertain
his
hearers
with
a
relation
of
divers
romantic
adventures
in
which
he
had
been
from
time
to
time
engaged
involving
various
interesting
anecdotes
of
a
thoroughbred
horse
and
a
magnificent
jewess
both
of
surpassing
beauty
and
much
coveted
by
the
nobility
and
gentry
of
these
kingdoms
long
before
these
elegant
extracts
from
the
biography
of
a
gentleman
were
concluded
mivins
had
betaken
himself
to
bed
and
had
set
in
snoring
for
the
night
leaving
the
timid
stranger
and
pickwick
to
the
full
benefit
of
smangle
s
experiences
nor
were
the
two
gentlemen
as
much
edified
as
they
might
have
been
by
the
moving
passages
narrated
pickwick
had
been
in
a
state
of
slumber
for
some
time
when
he
had
a
faint
perception
of
the
drunken
man
bursting
out
afresh
with
the
comic
song
and
receiving
from
smangle
a
gentle
intimation
through
the
medium
of
the
that
his
audience
was
not
musically
disposed
pickwick
then
once
again
dropped
off
to
sleep
with
a
confused
consciousness
that
smangle
was
still
engaged
in
relating
a
long
story
the
chief
point
of
which
appeared
to
be
that
on
some
occasion
particularly
stated
and
set
forth
he
had
done
a
bill
and
a
gentleman
at
the
same
time
chapter
xlii
illustrative
like
the
preceding
one
of
the
old
proverb
that
adversity
brings
a
man
acquainted
with
strange
bedfellows
likewise
containing
pickwick
s
extraordinary
and
startling
announcement
to
samuel
weller
when
pickwick
opened
his
eyes
next
morning
the
first
object
upon
which
they
rested
was
samuel
weller
seated
upon
a
small
black
portmanteau
intently
regarding
apparently
in
a
condition
of
profound
abstraction
the
stately
figure
of
the
dashing
smangle
while
smangle
himself
who
was
already
partially
dressed
was
seated
on
his
bedstead
occupied
in
the
desperately
hopeless
attempt
of
staring
weller
out
of
countenance
we
say
desperately
hopeless
because
sam
with
a
comprehensive
gaze
which
took
in
smangle
s
cap
feet
head
face
legs
and
whiskers
all
at
the
same
time
continued
to
look
steadily
on
with
every
demonstration
of
lively
satisfaction
but
with
no
more
regard
to
smangle
s
personal
sentiments
on
the
subject
than
he
would
have
displayed
had
he
been
inspecting
a
wooden
statue
or
a
guy
fawkes
well
will
you
know
me
again
said
smangle
with
a
frown
i
d
svear
to
you
anyveres
sir
replied
sam
cheerfully
don
t
be
impertinent
to
a
gentleman
sir
said
smangle
not
on
no
account
replied
sam
if
you
ll
tell
me
wen
he
wakes
i
ll
be
upon
the
wery
best
behaviour
this
observation
having
a
remote
tendency
to
imply
that
smangle
was
no
gentleman
kindled
his
ire
mivins
said
smangle
with
a
passionate
air
what
s
the
office
replied
that
gentleman
from
his
couch
who
the
devil
is
this
fellow
gad
said
mivins
looking
lazily
out
from
under
the
i
ought
to
ask
hasn
t
he
any
business
here
no
replied
smangle
then
knock
him
downstairs
and
tell
him
not
to
presume
to
get
up
till
i
come
and
kick
him
rejoined
mivins
with
this
prompt
advice
that
excellent
gentleman
again
betook
himself
to
slumber
the
conversation
exhibiting
these
unequivocal
symptoms
of
verging
on
the
personal
pickwick
deemed
it
a
fit
point
at
which
to
interpose
sam
said
pickwick
sir
rejoined
that
gentleman
has
anything
new
occurred
since
last
night
nothin
partickler
sir
replied
sam
glancing
at
smangle
s
whiskers
the
late
prewailance
of
a
close
and
confined
atmosphere
has
been
rayther
favourable
to
the
growth
of
veeds
of
an
alarmin
and
sangvinary
natur
but
vith
that
ere
exception
things
is
quiet
i
shall
get
up
said
pickwick
give
me
some
clean
whatever
hostile
intentions
smangle
might
have
entertained
his
thoughts
were
speedily
diverted
by
the
unpacking
of
the
portmanteau
the
contents
of
which
appeared
to
impress
him
at
once
with
a
most
favourable
opinion
not
only
of
pickwick
but
of
sam
also
who
he
took
an
early
opportunity
of
declaring
in
a
tone
of
voice
loud
enough
for
that
eccentric
personage
to
overhear
was
a
regular
thoroughbred
original
and
consequently
the
very
man
after
his
own
heart
as
to
pickwick
the
affection
he
conceived
for
him
knew
no
limits
now
is
there
anything
i
can
do
for
you
my
dear
sir
said
smangle
nothing
that
i
am
aware
of
i
am
obliged
to
you
replied
pickwick
no
linen
that
you
want
sent
to
the
washerwoman
s
i
know
a
delightful
washerwoman
outside
that
comes
for
my
things
twice
a
week
and
by
jove
how
devilish
lucky
this
is
the
day
she
calls
shall
i
put
any
of
those
little
things
up
with
mine
don
t
say
anything
about
the
trouble
confound
and
curse
it
if
one
gentleman
under
a
cloud
is
not
to
put
himself
a
little
out
of
the
way
to
assist
another
gentleman
in
the
same
condition
what
s
human
nature
thus
spake
smangle
edging
himself
meanwhile
as
near
as
possible
to
the
portmanteau
and
beaming
forth
looks
of
the
most
fervent
and
disinterested
friendship
there
s
nothing
you
want
to
give
out
for
the
man
to
brush
my
dear
creature
is
there
resumed
smangle
nothin
whatever
my
fine
feller
rejoined
sam
taking
the
reply
into
his
own
mouth
p
raps
if
vun
of
us
wos
to
brush
without
troubling
the
man
it
ud
be
more
agreeable
for
all
parties
as
the
schoolmaster
said
when
the
young
gentleman
objected
to
being
flogged
by
the
and
there
s
nothing
i
can
send
in
my
little
box
to
the
s
is
there
said
smangle
turning
from
sam
to
pickwick
with
an
air
of
some
discomfiture
nothin
whatever
sir
retorted
sam
i
m
afeered
the
little
box
must
be
chock
full
o
your
own
as
it
this
speech
was
accompanied
with
such
a
very
expressive
look
at
that
particular
portion
of
smangle
s
attire
by
the
appearance
of
which
the
skill
of
laundresses
in
getting
up
gentlemen
s
linen
is
generally
tested
that
he
was
fain
to
turn
upon
his
heel
and
for
the
present
at
any
rate
to
give
up
all
design
on
pickwick
s
purse
and
wardrobe
he
accordingly
retired
in
dudgeon
to
the
where
he
made
a
light
and
breakfast
on
a
couple
of
the
cigars
which
had
been
purchased
on
the
previous
night
mivins
who
was
no
smoker
and
whose
account
for
small
articles
of
chandlery
had
also
reached
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
slate
and
been
carried
over
to
the
other
side
remained
in
bed
and
in
his
own
words
took
it
out
in
after
breakfasting
in
a
small
closet
attached
to
the
which
bore
the
imposing
title
of
the
snuggery
the
temporary
inmate
of
which
in
consideration
of
a
small
additional
charge
had
the
unspeakable
advantage
of
overhearing
all
the
conversation
in
the
aforesaid
and
after
despatching
weller
on
some
necessary
errands
pickwick
repaired
to
the
lodge
to
consult
roker
concerning
his
future
accommodation
accommodation
eh
said
that
gentleman
consulting
a
large
book
plenty
of
that
pickwick
your
chummage
ticket
will
be
on
seven
in
the
oh
said
pickwick
my
what
did
you
say
your
chummage
ticket
replied
roker
you
re
up
to
that
not
quite
replied
pickwick
with
a
smile
why
said
roker
it
s
as
plain
as
salisbury
you
ll
have
a
chummage
ticket
upon
in
the
third
and
them
as
is
in
the
room
will
be
your
are
there
many
of
them
inquired
pickwick
dubiously
three
replied
roker
pickwick
coughed
one
of
em
s
a
parson
said
roker
filling
up
a
little
piece
of
paper
as
he
spoke
another
s
a
eh
exclaimed
pickwick
a
butcher
repeated
roker
giving
the
nib
of
his
pen
a
tap
on
the
desk
to
cure
it
of
a
disinclination
to
mark
what
a
goer
he
used
to
be
you
remember
tom
martin
neddy
said
roker
appealing
to
another
man
in
the
lodge
who
was
paring
the
mud
off
his
shoes
with
a
i
should
think
so
replied
the
party
addressed
with
a
strong
emphasis
on
the
personal
pronoun
bless
my
dear
eyes
said
roker
shaking
his
head
slowly
from
side
to
side
and
gazing
abstractedly
out
of
the
grated
windows
before
him
as
if
he
were
fondly
recalling
some
peaceful
scene
of
his
early
youth
it
seems
but
yesterday
that
he
whopped
the
down
by
the
wharf
there
i
think
i
can
see
him
now
up
the
strand
between
the
two
a
little
sobered
by
the
bruising
with
a
patch
o
winegar
and
brown
paper
over
his
right
eyelid
and
that
ere
lovely
bulldog
as
pinned
the
little
boy
arterwards
at
his
heels
what
a
rum
thing
time
is
ain
t
it
neddy
the
gentleman
to
whom
these
observations
were
addressed
who
appeared
of
a
taciturn
and
thoughtful
cast
merely
echoed
the
inquiry
roker
shaking
off
the
poetical
and
gloomy
train
of
thought
into
which
he
had
been
betrayed
descended
to
the
common
business
of
life
and
resumed
his
pen
do
you
know
what
the
third
gentlemen
is
inquired
pickwick
not
very
much
gratified
by
this
description
of
his
future
associates
what
is
that
simpson
neddy
said
roker
turning
to
his
companion
what
simpson
said
neddy
why
him
in
in
the
third
that
this
gentleman
s
going
to
be
chummed
oh
him
replied
neddy
he
s
nothing
exactly
he
horse
chaunter
he
s
a
leg
ah
so
i
thought
rejoined
roker
closing
the
book
and
placing
the
small
piece
of
paper
in
pickwick
s
hands
that
s
the
ticket
very
much
perplexed
by
this
summary
disposition
of
this
person
pickwick
walked
back
into
the
prison
revolving
in
his
mind
what
he
had
better
do
convinced
however
that
before
he
took
any
other
steps
it
would
be
advisable
to
see
and
hold
personal
converse
with
the
three
gentlemen
with
whom
it
was
proposed
to
quarter
him
he
made
the
best
of
his
way
to
the
third
flight
after
groping
about
in
the
gallery
for
some
time
attempting
in
the
dim
light
to
decipher
the
numbers
on
the
different
doors
he
at
length
appealed
to
a
who
happened
to
be
pursuing
his
morning
occupation
of
gleaning
for
pewter
which
is
my
good
fellow
said
pickwick
five
doors
farther
on
replied
the
there
s
the
likeness
of
a
man
being
hung
and
smoking
the
while
chalked
outside
the
guided
by
this
direction
pickwick
proceeded
slowly
along
the
gallery
until
he
encountered
the
portrait
of
a
gentleman
above
described
upon
whose
countenance
he
tapped
with
the
knuckle
of
his
forefinger
gently
at
first
and
then
audibly
after
repeating
this
process
several
times
without
effect
he
ventured
to
open
the
door
and
peep
in
there
was
only
one
man
in
the
room
and
he
was
leaning
out
of
window
as
far
as
he
could
without
overbalancing
himself
endeavouring
with
great
perseverance
to
spit
upon
the
crown
of
the
hat
of
a
personal
friend
on
the
parade
below
as
neither
speaking
coughing
sneezing
knocking
nor
any
other
ordinary
mode
of
attracting
attention
made
this
person
aware
of
the
presence
of
a
visitor
pickwick
after
some
delay
stepped
up
to
the
window
and
pulled
him
gently
by
the
coat
tail
the
individual
brought
in
his
head
and
shoulders
with
great
swiftness
and
surveying
pickwick
from
head
to
foot
demanded
in
a
surly
tone
what
the
something
beginning
with
a
capital
h
he
wanted
i
believe
said
pickwick
consulting
his
ticket
i
believe
this
is
in
the
third
well
replied
the
gentleman
i
have
come
here
in
consequence
of
receiving
this
bit
of
paper
rejoined
pickwick
hand
it
over
said
the
gentleman
pickwick
complied
i
think
roker
might
have
chummed
you
somewhere
else
said
simpson
for
it
was
the
leg
after
a
very
discontented
sort
of
a
pause
pickwick
thought
so
also
but
under
all
the
circumstances
he
considered
it
a
matter
of
sound
policy
to
be
silent
simpson
mused
for
a
few
moments
after
this
and
then
thrusting
his
head
out
of
the
window
gave
a
shrill
whistle
and
pronounced
some
word
aloud
several
times
what
the
word
was
pickwick
could
not
distinguish
but
he
rather
inferred
that
it
must
be
some
nickname
which
distinguished
martin
from
the
fact
of
a
great
number
of
gentlemen
on
the
ground
below
immediately
proceeding
to
cry
butcher
in
imitation
of
the
tone
in
which
that
useful
class
of
society
are
wont
diurnally
to
make
their
presence
known
at
area
railings
subsequent
occurrences
confirmed
the
accuracy
of
pickwick
s
impression
for
in
a
few
seconds
a
gentleman
prematurely
broad
for
his
years
clothed
in
a
professional
blue
jean
frock
and
with
circular
toes
entered
the
room
nearly
out
of
breath
closely
followed
by
another
gentleman
in
very
shabby
black
and
a
sealskin
cap
the
latter
gentleman
who
fastened
his
coat
all
the
way
up
to
his
chin
by
means
of
a
pin
and
a
button
alternately
had
a
very
coarse
red
face
and
looked
like
a
drunken
chaplain
which
indeed
he
was
these
two
gentlemen
having
by
turns
perused
pickwick
s
billet
the
one
expressed
his
opinion
that
it
was
a
rig
and
the
other
his
conviction
that
it
was
a
having
recorded
their
feelings
in
these
very
intelligible
terms
they
looked
at
pickwick
and
each
other
in
awkward
silence
it
s
an
aggravating
thing
just
as
we
got
the
beds
so
snug
said
the
chaplain
looking
at
three
dirty
mattresses
each
rolled
up
in
a
blanket
which
occupied
one
corner
of
the
room
during
the
day
and
formed
a
kind
of
slab
on
which
were
placed
an
old
cracked
basin
ewer
and
of
common
yellow
earthenware
with
a
blue
flower
very
martin
expressed
the
same
opinion
in
rather
stronger
terms
simpson
after
having
let
a
variety
of
expletive
adjectives
loose
upon
society
without
any
substantive
to
accompany
them
tucked
up
his
sleeves
and
began
to
wash
the
greens
for
dinner
while
this
was
going
on
pickwick
had
been
eyeing
the
room
which
was
filthily
dirty
and
smelt
intolerably
close
there
was
no
vestige
of
either
carpet
curtain
or
blind
there
was
not
even
a
closet
in
it
unquestionably
there
were
but
few
things
to
put
away
if
there
had
been
one
but
however
few
in
number
or
small
in
individual
amount
still
remnants
of
loaves
and
pieces
of
cheese
and
damp
towels
and
scrags
of
meat
and
articles
of
wearing
apparel
and
mutilated
crockery
and
bellows
without
nozzles
and
without
prongs
do
present
somewhat
of
an
uncomfortable
appearance
when
they
are
scattered
about
the
floor
of
a
small
apartment
which
is
the
common
sitting
and
sleeping
room
of
three
idle
men
i
suppose
this
can
be
managed
somehow
said
the
butcher
after
a
pretty
long
silence
what
will
you
take
to
go
out
i
beg
your
pardon
replied
pickwick
what
did
you
say
i
hardly
understand
what
will
you
take
to
be
paid
out
said
the
butcher
the
regular
chummage
is
will
you
take
three
bob
and
a
bender
suggested
the
clerical
gentleman
well
i
don
t
mind
that
it
s
only
twopence
a
piece
more
said
martin
what
do
you
say
now
we
ll
pay
you
out
for
a
week
come
and
stand
a
gallon
of
beer
down
chimed
in
simpson
there
and
drink
it
on
the
spot
said
the
chaplain
now
i
really
am
so
wholly
ignorant
of
the
rules
of
this
place
returned
pickwick
that
i
do
not
yet
comprehend
you
can
i
live
anywhere
else
i
thought
i
could
at
this
inquiry
martin
looked
with
a
countenance
of
excessive
surprise
at
his
two
friends
and
then
each
gentleman
pointed
with
his
right
thumb
over
his
left
shoulder
this
action
imperfectly
described
in
words
by
the
very
feeble
term
of
over
the
left
when
performed
by
any
number
of
ladies
or
gentlemen
who
are
accustomed
to
act
in
unison
has
a
very
graceful
and
airy
effect
its
expression
is
one
of
light
and
playful
sarcasm
repeated
martin
with
a
smile
of
pity
well
if
i
knew
as
little
of
life
as
that
i
d
eat
my
hat
and
swallow
the
buckle
whole
said
the
clerical
gentleman
so
would
i
added
the
sporting
one
solemnly
after
this
introductory
preface
the
three
chums
informed
pickwick
in
a
breath
that
money
was
in
the
fleet
just
what
money
was
out
of
it
that
it
would
instantly
procure
him
almost
anything
he
desired
and
that
supposing
he
had
it
and
had
no
objection
to
spend
it
if
he
only
signified
his
wish
to
have
a
room
to
himself
he
might
take
possession
of
one
furnished
and
fitted
to
boot
in
half
an
hour
s
time
with
this
the
parties
separated
very
much
to
their
common
satisfaction
pickwick
once
more
retracing
his
steps
to
the
lodge
and
the
three
companions
adjourning
to
the
there
to
spend
the
five
shillings
which
the
clerical
gentleman
had
with
admirable
prudence
and
foresight
borrowed
of
him
for
the
purpose
i
knowed
it
said
roker
with
a
chuckle
when
pickwick
stated
the
object
with
which
he
had
returned
didn
t
i
say
so
neddy
the
philosophical
owner
of
the
universal
penknife
growled
an
affirmative
i
knowed
you
d
want
a
room
for
yourself
bless
you
said
roker
let
me
see
you
ll
want
some
furniture
you
ll
hire
that
of
me
i
suppose
that
s
the
reg
lar
with
great
pleasure
replied
pickwick
there
s
a
capital
room
up
in
the
flight
that
belongs
to
a
chancery
prisoner
said
roker
it
ll
stand
you
in
a
pound
a
week
i
suppose
you
don
t
mind
that
not
at
all
said
pickwick
just
step
there
with
me
said
roker
taking
up
his
hat
with
great
alacrity
the
matter
s
settled
in
five
minutes
lord
why
didn
t
you
say
at
first
that
you
was
willing
to
come
down
handsome
the
matter
was
soon
arranged
as
the
turnkey
had
foretold
the
chancery
prisoner
had
been
there
long
enough
to
have
lost
his
friends
fortune
home
and
happiness
and
to
have
acquired
the
right
of
having
a
room
to
himself
as
he
laboured
however
under
the
inconvenience
of
often
wanting
a
morsel
of
bread
he
eagerly
listened
to
pickwick
s
proposal
to
rent
the
apartment
and
readily
covenanted
and
agreed
to
yield
him
up
the
sole
and
undisturbed
possession
thereof
in
consideration
of
the
weekly
payment
of
twenty
shillings
from
which
fund
he
furthermore
contracted
to
pay
out
any
person
or
persons
that
might
be
chummed
upon
it
as
they
struck
the
bargain
pickwick
surveyed
him
with
a
painful
interest
he
was
a
tall
gaunt
cadaverous
man
in
an
old
greatcoat
and
slippers
with
sunken
cheeks
and
a
restless
eager
eye
his
lips
were
bloodless
and
his
bones
sharp
and
thin
god
help
him
the
iron
teeth
of
confinement
and
privation
had
been
slowly
filing
him
down
for
twenty
years
and
where
will
you
live
meanwhile
sir
said
pickwick
as
he
laid
the
amount
of
the
first
week
s
rent
in
advance
on
the
tottering
table
the
man
gathered
up
the
money
with
a
trembling
hand
and
replied
that
he
didn
t
know
yet
he
must
go
and
see
where
he
could
move
his
bed
to
i
am
afraid
sir
said
pickwick
laying
his
hand
gently
and
compassionately
on
his
arm
i
am
afraid
you
will
have
to
live
in
some
noisy
crowded
place
now
pray
consider
this
room
your
own
when
you
want
quiet
or
when
any
of
your
friends
come
to
see
friends
interposed
the
man
in
a
voice
which
rattled
in
his
throat
if
i
lay
dead
at
the
bottom
of
the
deepest
mine
in
the
world
tight
screwed
down
and
soldered
in
my
coffin
rotting
in
the
dark
and
filthy
ditch
that
drags
its
slime
along
beneath
the
foundations
of
this
prison
i
could
not
be
more
forgotten
or
unheeded
than
i
am
here
i
am
a
dead
man
dead
to
society
without
the
pity
they
bestow
on
those
whose
souls
have
passed
to
judgment
friends
to
see
me
my
god
i
have
sunk
from
the
prime
of
life
into
old
age
in
this
place
and
there
is
not
one
to
raise
his
hand
above
my
bed
when
i
lie
dead
upon
it
and
say
it
is
a
blessing
he
is
gone
the
excitement
which
had
cast
an
unwonted
light
over
the
man
s
face
while
he
spoke
subsided
as
he
concluded
and
pressing
his
withered
hands
together
in
a
hasty
and
disordered
manner
he
shuffled
from
the
room
rides
rather
rusty
said
roker
with
a
smile
ah
they
re
like
the
elephants
they
feel
it
now
and
then
and
it
makes
em
wild
having
made
this
remark
roker
entered
upon
his
arrangements
with
such
expedition
that
in
a
short
time
the
room
was
furnished
with
a
carpet
six
chairs
a
table
a
sofa
bedstead
a
kettle
and
various
small
articles
on
hire
at
the
very
reasonable
rate
of
shillings
and
sixpence
per
week
now
is
there
anything
more
we
can
do
for
you
inquired
roker
looking
round
with
great
satisfaction
and
gaily
chinking
the
first
week
s
hire
in
his
closed
fist
why
yes
said
pickwick
who
had
been
musing
deeply
for
some
time
are
there
any
people
here
who
run
on
errands
and
so
forth
outside
do
you
mean
inquired
roker
yes
i
mean
who
are
able
to
go
outside
not
yes
there
is
said
roker
there
s
an
unfortunate
devil
who
has
got
a
friend
on
the
poor
side
that
s
glad
to
do
anything
of
that
sort
he
s
been
running
odd
jobs
and
that
for
the
last
two
months
shall
i
send
him
if
you
please
rejoined
pickwick
stay
no
the
poor
side
you
say
i
should
like
to
see
it
i
ll
go
to
him
the
poor
side
of
a
debtor
s
prison
is
as
its
name
imports
that
in
which
the
most
miserable
and
abject
class
of
debtors
are
confined
a
prisoner
having
declared
upon
the
poor
side
pays
neither
rent
nor
chummage
his
fees
upon
entering
and
leaving
the
jail
are
reduced
in
amount
and
he
becomes
entitled
to
a
share
of
some
small
quantities
of
food
to
provide
which
a
few
charitable
persons
have
from
time
to
time
left
trifling
legacies
in
their
wills
most
of
our
readers
will
remember
that
until
within
a
very
few
years
past
there
was
a
kind
of
iron
cage
in
the
wall
of
the
fleet
prison
within
which
was
posted
some
man
of
hungry
looks
who
from
time
to
time
rattled
a
and
exclaimed
in
a
mournful
voice
pray
remember
the
poor
debtors
pray
remember
the
poor
the
receipts
of
this
box
when
there
were
any
were
divided
among
the
poor
prisoners
and
the
men
on
the
poor
side
relieved
each
other
in
this
degrading
office
although
this
custom
has
been
abolished
and
the
cage
is
now
boarded
up
the
miserable
and
destitute
condition
of
these
unhappy
persons
remains
the
same
we
no
longer
suffer
them
to
appeal
at
the
prison
gates
to
the
charity
and
compassion
of
the
passersby
but
we
still
leave
unblotted
the
leaves
of
our
statute
book
for
the
reverence
and
admiration
of
succeeding
ages
the
just
and
wholesome
law
which
declares
that
the
sturdy
felon
shall
be
fed
and
clothed
and
that
the
penniless
debtor
shall
be
left
to
die
of
starvation
and
nakedness
this
is
no
fiction
not
a
week
passes
over
our
head
but
in
every
one
of
our
prisons
for
debt
some
of
these
men
must
inevitably
expire
in
the
slow
agonies
of
want
if
they
were
not
relieved
by
their
turning
these
things
in
his
mind
as
he
mounted
the
narrow
staircase
at
the
foot
of
which
roker
had
left
him
pickwick
gradually
worked
himself
to
the
point
and
so
excited
was
he
with
his
reflections
on
this
subject
that
he
had
burst
into
the
room
to
which
he
had
been
directed
before
he
had
any
distinct
recollection
either
of
the
place
in
which
he
was
or
of
the
object
of
his
visit
the
general
aspect
of
the
room
recalled
him
to
himself
at
once
but
he
had
no
sooner
cast
his
eye
on
the
figure
of
a
man
who
was
brooding
over
the
dusty
fire
than
letting
his
hat
fall
on
the
floor
he
stood
perfectly
fixed
and
immovable
with
astonishment
yes
in
tattered
garments
and
without
a
coat
his
common
calico
shirt
yellow
and
in
rags
his
hair
hanging
over
his
face
his
features
changed
with
suffering
and
pinched
with
famine
there
sat
alfred
jingle
his
head
resting
on
his
hands
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
fire
and
his
whole
appearance
denoting
misery
and
dejection
near
him
leaning
listlessly
against
the
wall
stood
a
countryman
flicking
with
a
the
that
adorned
his
right
foot
his
left
being
thrust
into
an
old
slipper
horses
dogs
and
drink
had
brought
him
there
there
was
a
rusty
spur
on
the
solitary
boot
which
he
occasionally
jerked
into
the
empty
air
at
the
same
time
giving
the
boot
a
smart
blow
and
muttering
some
of
the
sounds
by
which
a
sportsman
encourages
his
horse
he
was
riding
in
imagination
some
desperate
steeplechase
at
that
moment
poor
wretch
he
never
rode
a
match
on
the
swiftest
animal
in
his
costly
stud
with
half
the
speed
at
which
he
had
torn
along
the
course
that
ended
in
the
fleet
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
an
old
man
was
seated
on
a
small
wooden
box
with
his
eyes
riveted
on
the
floor
and
his
face
settled
into
an
expression
of
the
deepest
and
most
hopeless
despair
a
young
girl
his
little
was
hanging
about
him
endeavouring
with
a
thousand
childish
devices
to
engage
his
attention
but
the
old
man
neither
saw
nor
heard
her
the
voice
that
had
been
music
to
him
and
the
eyes
that
had
been
light
fell
coldly
on
his
senses
his
limbs
were
shaking
with
disease
and
the
palsy
had
fastened
on
his
mind
there
were
two
or
three
other
men
in
the
room
congregated
in
a
little
knot
and
noiselessly
talking
among
themselves
there
was
a
lean
and
haggard
woman
too
a
prisoner
s
wife
who
was
watering
with
great
solicitude
the
wretched
stump
of
a
withered
plant
which
it
was
plain
to
see
could
never
send
forth
a
green
leaf
again
too
true
an
emblem
perhaps
of
the
office
she
had
come
there
to
discharge
such
were
the
objects
which
presented
themselves
to
pickwick
s
view
as
he
looked
round
him
in
amazement
the
noise
of
some
one
stumbling
hastily
into
the
room
roused
him
turning
his
eyes
towards
the
door
they
encountered
the
and
in
him
through
his
rags
and
dirt
he
recognised
the
familiar
features
of
job

mr
pickwick
exclaimed
job
aloud

jingle
starting
from

mr
so

jingle
thrust
his
hands
into
the
place
where
his
trousers
pockets
used
to
be
and
dropping
his
chin
upon
his
breast
sank
back
into
his
chair
pickwick
was
affected
the
two
men
looked
so
very
miserable
the
sharp
involuntary
glance
jingle
had
cast
at
a
small
piece
of
raw
loin
of
mutton
which

in
with
him
said
more
of
their

of

with
his
accustomed
volubility
and
with
various
twitches
of
the
countenance
to
counterfeit
smiles
pickwick
easily
perceived
that
his
recklessness
was
assumed
and
looking
him
full
but
not
unkindly
in
the
face
saw
that
his
eyes
were
moist

presenting

described
him
by
the

as

the
best
of

in
his

he
looked

pickwick
trying

down
his
waistcoat
take
that
take
what
in
the
ordinary
acceptation
of
such
language
it
should
have
been
a
blow
as
the
world
runs
it
ought
to
have
been
a
sound
hearty
cuff
for
pickwick
had
been
duped
deceived
and
wronged
by
the
destitute
outcast
who
was
now
wholly
in
his
power
must
we
tell
the
truth
it
was
something
from
pickwick
s
waistcoat
pocket
which
chinked
as
it
was
given
into
job
s
hand
and
the
giving
of
which
somehow
or
other
imparted
a
sparkle
to
the
eye
and
a
swelling
to
the
heart
of
our
excellent
old
friend
as
he
hurried
away
sam
had
returned
when
pickwick
reached
his
own
room
and
was
inspecting
the
arrangements
that
had
been
made
for
his
comfort
with
a
kind
of
grim
satisfaction
which
was
very
pleasant
to
look
upon
having
a
decided
objection
to
his
master
s
being
there
at
all
weller
appeared
to
consider
it
a
high
moral
duty
not
to
appear
too
much
pleased
with
anything
that
was
done
said
suggested
or
proposed
well
sam
said
pickwick
well
sir
replied
weller
pretty
comfortable
now
eh
sam
pretty
vell
sir
responded
sam
looking
round
him
in
a
disparaging
manner
have
you
seen
tupman
and
our
other
friends
yes
i
em
sir
and
they
re
and
wos
wery
much
surprised
to
hear
they
warn
t
to
come
replied
sam
you
have
brought
the
things
i
wanted
weller
in
reply
pointed
to
various
packages
which
he
had
arranged
as
neatly
as
he
could
in
a
corner
of
the
room
very
well
sam
said
pickwick
after
a
little
hesitation
listen
to
what
i
am
going
to
say
cert
nly
sir
rejoined
weller
fire
away
i
have
felt
from
the
first
sam
said
pickwick
with
much
solemnity
that
this
is
not
the
place
to
bring
a
young
man
nor
an
old
un
neither
sir
observed
weller
you
re
quite
right
sam
said
pickwick
but
old
men
may
come
here
through
their
own
heedlessness
and
unsuspicion
and
young
men
may
be
brought
here
by
the
selfishness
of
those
they
serve
it
is
better
for
those
young
men
in
every
point
of
view
that
they
should
not
remain
here
do
you
understand
me
sam
vy
no
sir
i
do
replied
weller
doggedly
try
sam
said
pickwick
vell
sir
rejoined
sam
after
a
short
pause
i
think
i
see
your
drift
and
if
i
do
see
your
drift
it
s
my
pinion
that
you
re
it
a
great
deal
too
strong
as
the
said
to
the
snowstorm
ven
it
overtook
i
see
you
comprehend
me
sam
said
pickwick
independently
of
my
wish
that
you
should
not
be
idling
about
a
place
like
this
for
years
to
come
i
feel
that
for
a
debtor
in
the
fleet
to
be
attended
by
his
manservant
is
a
monstrous
absurdity
sam
said
pickwick
for
a
time
you
must
leave
oh
for
a
time
eh
sir
rejoined
weller
rather
sarcastically
yes
for
the
time
that
i
remain
here
said
pickwick
your
wages
i
shall
continue
to
pay
any
one
of
my
three
friends
will
be
happy
to
take
you
were
it
only
out
of
respect
to
me
and
if
i
ever
do
leave
this
place
sam
added
pickwick
with
assumed
cheerfulness
if
i
do
i
pledge
you
my
word
that
you
shall
return
to
me
now
i
ll
tell
you
wot
it
is
sir
said
weller
in
a
grave
and
solemn
voice
this
here
sort
o
thing
won
t
do
at
all
so
don
t
let
s
hear
no
more
about
i
am
serious
and
resolved
sam
said
pickwick
you
air
air
you
sir
inquired
weller
firmly
wery
good
sir
then
so
am
thus
speaking
weller
fixed
his
hat
on
his
head
with
great
precision
and
abruptly
left
the
room
sam
cried
pickwick
calling
after
him
sam
here
but
the
long
gallery
ceased
to
the
sound
of
footsteps
sam
weller
was
gone
chapter
xliii
showing
how
samuel
weller
got
into
difficulties
in
a
lofty
room
and
worse
ventilated
situated
in
portugal
street
lincoln
s
inn
fields
there
sit
nearly
the
whole
year
round
one
two
three
or
four
gentlemen
in
wigs
as
the
case
may
be
with
little
before
them
constructed
after
the
fashion
of
those
used
by
the
judges
of
the
land
barring
the
french
polish
there
is
a
box
of
barristers
on
their
right
hand
there
is
an
enclosure
of
insolvent
debtors
on
their
left
and
there
is
an
inclined
plane
of
most
especially
dirty
faces
in
their
front
these
gentlemen
are
the
commissioners
of
the
insolvent
court
and
the
place
in
which
they
sit
is
the
insolvent
court
itself
it
is
and
has
been
time
out
of
mind
the
remarkable
fate
of
this
court
to
be
somehow
or
other
held
and
understood
by
the
general
consent
of
all
the
destitute
people
in
london
as
their
common
resort
and
place
of
daily
refuge
it
is
always
full
the
steams
of
beer
and
spirits
perpetually
ascend
to
the
ceiling
and
being
condensed
by
the
heat
roll
down
the
walls
like
rain
there
are
more
old
suits
of
clothes
in
it
at
one
time
than
will
be
offered
for
sale
in
all
houndsditch
in
a
twelvemonth
more
unwashed
skins
and
grizzly
beards
than
all
the
pumps
and
between
tyburn
and
whitechapel
could
render
decent
between
sunrise
and
sunset
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
any
of
these
people
have
the
least
shadow
of
business
in
or
the
remotest
connection
with
the
place
they
so
indefatigably
attend
if
they
had
it
would
be
no
matter
of
surprise
and
the
singularity
of
the
thing
would
cease
some
of
them
sleep
during
the
greater
part
of
the
sitting
others
carry
small
portable
dinners
wrapped
in
or
sticking
out
of
their
pockets
and
munch
and
listen
with
equal
relish
but
no
one
among
them
was
ever
known
to
have
the
slightest
personal
interest
in
any
case
that
was
ever
brought
forward
whatever
they
do
there
they
sit
from
the
first
moment
to
the
last
when
it
is
heavy
rainy
weather
they
all
come
in
wet
through
and
at
such
times
the
vapours
of
the
court
are
like
those
of
a
a
casual
visitor
might
suppose
this
place
to
be
a
temple
dedicated
to
the
genius
of
seediness
there
is
not
a
messenger
or
attached
to
it
who
wears
a
coat
that
was
made
for
him
not
a
tolerably
fresh
or
man
in
the
whole
establishment
except
a
little
tipstaff
and
even
he
like
an
conditioned
cherry
preserved
in
brandy
seems
to
have
artificially
dried
and
withered
up
into
a
state
of
preservation
to
which
he
can
lay
no
natural
claim
the
very
barristers
wigs
are
and
their
curls
lack
crispness
but
the
attorneys
who
sit
at
a
large
bare
table
below
the
commissioners
are
after
all
the
greatest
curiosities
the
professional
establishment
of
the
more
opulent
of
these
gentlemen
consists
of
a
blue
bag
and
a
boy
generally
a
youth
of
the
jewish
persuasion
they
have
no
fixed
offices
their
legal
business
being
transacted
in
the
parlours
of
or
the
yards
of
prisons
whither
they
repair
in
crowds
and
canvass
for
customers
after
the
manner
of
omnibus
cads
they
are
of
a
greasy
and
mildewed
appearance
and
if
they
can
be
said
to
have
any
vices
at
all
perhaps
drinking
and
cheating
are
the
most
conspicuous
among
them
their
residences
are
usually
on
the
outskirts
of
the
rules
chiefly
lying
within
a
circle
of
one
mile
from
the
obelisk
in
george
s
fields
their
looks
are
not
prepossessing
and
their
manners
are
peculiar
solomon
pell
one
of
this
learned
body
was
a
fat
flabby
pale
man
in
a
surtout
which
looked
green
one
minute
and
brown
the
next
with
a
velvet
collar
of
the
same
chameleon
tints
his
forehead
was
narrow
his
face
wide
his
head
large
and
his
nose
all
on
one
side
as
if
nature
indignant
with
the
propensities
she
observed
in
him
in
his
birth
had
given
it
an
angry
tweak
which
it
had
never
recovered
being
and
asthmatic
however
he
respired
principally
through
this
feature
so
perhaps
what
it
wanted
in
ornament
it
made
up
in
usefulness
i
m
sure
to
bring
him
through
it
said
pell
are
you
though
replied
the
person
to
whom
the
assurance
was
pledged
certain
sure
replied
pell
but
if
he
d
gone
to
any
irregular
practitioner
mind
you
i
wouldn
t
have
answered
for
the
ah
said
the
other
with
open
mouth
no
that
i
wouldn
t
said
pell
and
he
pursed
up
his
lips
frowned
and
shook
his
head
mysteriously
now
the
place
where
this
discourse
occurred
was
the
just
opposite
to
the
insolvent
court
and
the
person
with
whom
it
was
held
was
no
other
than
the
elder
weller
who
had
come
there
to
comfort
and
console
a
friend
whose
petition
to
be
discharged
under
the
act
was
to
be
that
day
heard
and
whose
attorney
he
was
at
that
moment
consulting
and
vere
is
george
inquired
the
old
gentleman
pell
jerked
his
head
in
the
direction
of
a
back
parlour
whither
weller
at
once
repairing
was
immediately
greeted
in
the
warmest
and
most
flattering
manner
by
some
of
his
professional
brethren
in
token
of
their
gratification
at
his
arrival
the
insolvent
gentleman
who
had
contracted
a
speculative
but
imprudent
passion
for
horsing
long
stages
which
had
led
to
his
present
embarrassments
looked
extremely
well
and
was
soothing
the
excitement
of
his
feelings
with
shrimps
and
porter
the
salutation
between
weller
and
his
friends
was
strictly
confined
to
the
freemasonry
of
the
craft
consisting
of
a
jerking
round
of
the
right
wrist
and
a
tossing
of
the
little
finger
into
the
air
at
the
same
time
we
once
knew
two
famous
coachmen
they
are
dead
now
poor
fellows
who
were
twins
and
between
whom
an
unaffected
and
devoted
attachment
existed
they
passed
each
other
on
the
dover
road
every
day
for
years
never
exchanging
any
other
greeting
than
this
and
yet
when
one
died
the
other
pined
away
and
soon
afterwards
followed
him
vell
george
said
weller
senior
taking
off
his
upper
coat
and
seating
himself
with
his
accustomed
gravity

right

and
full
inside

replied
the
embarrassed
gentleman

george
nodded
in
the
affirmative

that

george
wringing
the
heads
off
half
a
dozen
shrimps
and
swallowing
them
without
any
more
ado

said
pell
guessing
at
weller
s
meaning
the
schedule
is
as
plain
and
satisfactory
as
pen
and
ink
can
make
weller
nodded
in
a
manner
which
bespoke
his
inward
approval
of
these
arrangements
and
then
turning
to
pell
said
pointing
to
his
friend
george
ven
do
you
take
his
cloths
off

replied
pell
he
stands
third
on
the
opposed
list
and
i
should
think
it
would
be
his
turn
in
about
half
an
hour
i
told
my
clerk
to
come
over
and
tell
us
when
there
was
a
weller
surveyed
the
attorney
from

to

with
great
admiration
and
said
emphatically

what

i

that

been
fortunate
enough
to
fall
into

that
but
i
won
t

what
i
was

service
to
having
emptied
the
glass
in
a
twinkling
pell
smacked
his
lips
and
looked
complacently
round
on
the
assembled
coachmen
who
evidently
regarded
him
as
a
species
of
divinity

see

know
my

again
if

this

sound
was
a
solemn
and
dignified
cough
in
which
pell
observing
an
indecent
tendency
to
mirth
in
some
of
his
auditors
considered
it
due
to
himself
to
indulge

man

who
looked
extremely
unlikely
to

anything
more
why

a
murmur
of

through

company
i

pell

on

occasion
there
was

everything
as
splendid
as
if

and
a
man
in
a

suit
of
armour
guarding
the
mace
with
a
drawn
sword
and
silk
stockings
which
is
perpetually
done

and

when

pell

then

i

took
it
up
and
if
he
d
been
a
poor
man
they
would
ha
done
but
my
dear
friend
argued
pell
it
was
in
in
what
said
weller
in
oh
wery

replied
weller
after
a
little
reflection
if
he
damned
hisself
in
confidence
o

that
was
another
of
course
it
was
said
pell

distinction

obvious

go
on
no
i
will
not
go
on
sir
said
pell
in
a
low
and
serious
tone
you
have
reminded
me
sir
that
this
conversation
was
private
private
and
confidential
gentlemen
gentlemen
i
am
a
professional
man
it
may
be
that
i
am
a
good
deal
looked
up
to
in
my
profession
it
may
be
that
i
am
not
most
people
know
i
say
nothing
observations
have
already
been
made
in
this
room
injurious
to
the
reputation
of
my
noble
friend
you
will
excuse
me
gentlemen
i
was
imprudent
i
feel
that
i
have
no
right
to
mention
this
matter
without
his
concurrence
thank
you
sir
thank
thus
delivering
himself
pell
thrust
his
hands
into
his
pockets
and
frowning
grimly
around
rattled
three
halfpence
with
terrible
determination
this
virtuous
resolution
had
scarcely
been
formed
when
the
boy
and
the
blue
bag
who
were
inseparable
companions
rushed
violently
into
the
room
and
said
at
least
the
boy
did
for
the
blue
bag
took
no
part
in
the
announcement
that
the
case
was
coming
on
directly
the
intelligence
was
no
sooner
received
than
the
whole
party
hurried
across
the
street
and
began
to
fight
their
way
into
court
a
preparatory
ceremony
which
has
been
calculated
to
occupy
in
ordinary
cases
from
minutes
to
thirty
weller
being
stout
cast
himself
at
once
into
the
crowd
with
the
desperate
hope
of
ultimately
turning
up
in
some
place
which
would
suit
him
his
success
was
not
quite
equal
to
his
expectations
for
having
neglected
to
take
his
hat
off
it
was
knocked
over
his
eyes
by
some
unseen
person
upon
whose
toes
he
had
alighted
with
considerable
force
apparently
this
individual
regretted
his
impetuosity
immediately
afterwards
for
muttering
an
indistinct
exclamation
of
surprise
he
dragged
the
old
man
out
into
the
hall
and
after
a
violent
struggle
released
his
head
and

exclaimed

sam
always
on
about

and

and
that

the

earnestly
i

replied
the
junior
weller
seized
his
son
s
hand
clasped
it
and
let
it
fall
there
was
an
expression
on
his
countenance
in
doing
so
not
of
dismay
or
apprehension
but
partaking
more
of
the
sweet
and
gentle
character
of
hope
a
gleam
of
resignation
and
even
of
cheerfulness
passed
over
his
face
too
as
he
slowly
said
i

t
quite
certain
sammy
i
wouldn

redder

he
imbibes
some
thoughts
of
the
rum

to
obtrude
themselves
on
weller
s
mind
as
he
said
this
for
he
looked
gloomy
and
thoughtful
but
he
very
shortly
recovered
as
was
testified
by
a
perfect
alphabet
of
winks
in
which
he
was
only
wont
to
indulge
when

applied

to

after
which
the

sat
himself
down
on
a
stone
step
and
laughed
till

was
purple
wot

gave
his
body
a
sudden
wrench
to
one
side
and
by
a
dexterous
twist
contrived
to
get
his
right
hand
into
a
most
capacious
pocket
from
whence
after
a
great
deal
of
panting
and
exertion
he
extricated
a
of
the
large
octavo
size
fastened
by
a
huge
leathern
strap
from
this
ledger
he
drew
forth
a
couple
of
whiplashes
three
or
four
buckles
a
little
of
corn
and
finally
a
small
roll
of
very
dirty
from
which
he
selected
the
required
amount
which
he
handed
over
to
sam
and
now
sammy
said
the
old
gentleman
when
the
and
the
buckles

the
samples

feeling
upon
this
point
weller
at
once
sought
the
erudite
solomon
pell
and
acquainted
him
with
his
desire
to
issue
a
writ
instantly
for
the
pounds
and
costs
of
process
to
be
executed
without
delay
upon
the
body
of
one
samuel
weller
the
charges
thereby
incurred
to
be
paid
in
advance
to
solomon
pell
the
attorney
was
in
high
glee
for
the
embarrassed
was
ordered
to
be
discharged
forthwith
he
highly
approved
of
sam
s
attachment
to
his
master
declared
that
it
strongly
reminded
him
of
his
own
feelings
of
devotion
to
his
friend
the
chancellor
and
at
once
led
the
elder
weller
down
to
the
temple
to
swear
the
affidavit
of
debt
which
the
boy
with
the
assistance
of
the
blue
bag
had
drawn
up
on
the
spot
meanwhile
sam
having
been
formally
introduced
to
the
whitewashed
gentleman
and
his
friends
as
the
offspring
of
weller
of
the
belle
savage
was
treated
with
marked
distinction
and
invited
to
regale
himself
with
them
in
honour
of
the
occasion
an
invitation
which
he
was
by
no
means
backward
in
accepting
the
mirth
of
gentlemen
of
this
class
is
of
a
grave
and
quiet
character
usually
but
the
present
instance
was
one
of
peculiar
festivity
and
they
relaxed
in
proportion
after
some
rather
tumultuous
toasting
of
the
chief
commissioner
and
solomon
pell
who
had
that
day
displayed
such
transcendent
abilities
a
gentleman
in
a
blue
shawl
proposed
that
somebody
should
sing
a
song
the
obvious
suggestion
was
that
the
gentleman
being
anxious
for
a
song
should
sing
it
himself
but
this
the
gentleman
sturdily
and
somewhat
offensively
declined
to
do
upon
which
as
is
not
unusual
in
such
cases
a
rather
angry
colloquy
ensued
gentlemen
said
the
rather
than
disturb
the
harmony
of
this
delightful
occasion
perhaps
samuel
weller
will
oblige
the
raly
gentlemen
said
sam
i
m
not
wery
much
in
the
habit
o
singin
without
the
instrument

a
quiet
life

he
took

sitivation

this
prelude

at
once
into
the
following
wild
and
beautiful
legend
which
under
the
impression
that
it
is
not
generally
known
we
take
the
liberty
of
quoting
we
would
beg
to
call
particular
attention
to
the
monosyllable
at
the
end
of
the
second
and
fourth
lines
which
not
only
enables
the
singer
to
take
breath
at
those
points
but
greatly
assists

abreast

at
once
said
sam
still
hesitating
pickwick
looked
amazed
but
said
nothing
the
fact
is
said
sam
stopping
short
well
said
pickwick
speak
out
why
the
fact
is
said
sam
with
a
desperate
effort
perhaps
i
d
better
see
arter
my
bed
afore
i
do
anythin
bed
exclaimed
pickwick
in
astonishment
yes
my
bed
sir
replied
sam
i
m
a
prisoner
i
was
arrested
this
here
wery
arternoon
for
you
arrested
for
debt
exclaimed
pickwick
sinking
into
a
chair
yes
for
debt
sir
replied
sam
and
the
man
as
puts
me
in
ull
never
let
me
out
till
you
go
bless
my
heart
and
soul
ejaculated
pickwick
what
do
you
mean
wot
i
say
sir
rejoined
sam
if
it
s
forty
years
to
come
i
shall
be
a
prisoner
and
i
m
very
glad
on
it
and
if
it
had
been
newgate
it
would
ha
been
just
the
same
now
the
murder
s
out
and
damme
there
s
an
end
on
it
with
these
words
which
he
repeated
with
great
emphasis
and
violence
sam
weller
dashed
his
hat
upon
the
ground
in
a
most
unusual
state
of
excitement
and
then
folding
his
arms
looked
firmly
and
fixedly
in
his
master
s
face
chapter
lxiv
treats
of
divers
little
matters
which
occurred
in
the
fleet
and
of
winkle
s
mysterious
behaviour
and
shows
how
the
poor
chancery
prisoner
obtained
his
release
at
last
pickwick
felt
a
great
deal
too
much
touched
by
the
warmth
of
sam
s
attachment
to
be
able
to
exhibit
any
manifestation
of
anger
or
displeasure
at
the
precipitate
course
he
had
adopted
in
voluntarily
consigning
himself
to
a
debtor
s
prison
for
an
indefinite
period
the
only
point
on
which
he
persevered
in
demanding
an
explanation
was
the
name
of
sam
s
detaining
creditor
but
this
weller
as
perseveringly
withheld
it
ain
t
o
no
use
sir
said
sam
again
and
again
he
s
a
malicious
spiteful
windictive
creetur
with
a
hard
heart
as
there
ain
t
no
soft
nin
as
the
wirtuous
clergyman
remarked
of
the
old
gen
l
m
n
with
the
dropsy
ven
he
said
that
upon
the
whole
he
thought
he
d
rayther
leave
his
property
to
his
vife
than
build
a
chapel
vith
but
consider
sam
pickwick
remonstrated
the
sum
is
so
small
that
it
can
very
easily
be
paid
and
having
made
up
my
mind
that
you
shall
stop
with
me
you
should
recollect
how
much
more
useful
you
would
be
if
you
could
go
outside
the
wery
much
obliged
to
you
sir
replied
weller
gravely
but
i
d
rayther
rather
not
do
what
sam
wy
i
d
rayther
not
let
myself
down
to
ask
a
favour
o
this
here
unremorseful
but
it
is
no
favour
asking
him
to
take
his
money
sam
reasoned
pickwick
beg
your
pardon
sir
rejoined
sam
but
it
ud
be
a
wery
great
favour
to
pay
it
and
he
don
t
deserve
none
that
s
where
it
is
here
pickwick
rubbing
his
nose
with
an
air
of
some
vexation
weller
thought
it
prudent
to
change
the
theme
of
the
discourse
i
takes
my
determination
on
principle
sir
remarked
sam
and
you
takes
yours
on
the
same
ground
wich
puts
me
in
mind
o
the
man
as
killed
on
principle
wich
o
course
you
ve
heerd
on
weller
paused
when
he
arrived
at
this
point
and
cast
a
comical
look
at
his
master
out
of
the
corners
of
his
eyes
there
is
no
of
course
in
the
case
sam
said
pickwick
gradually
breaking
into
a
smile
in
spite
of
the
uneasiness
which
sam
s
obstinacy
had
given
him
the
fame
of
the
gentleman
in
question
never
reached
my
no
sir
exclaimed
weller

me

as

their
feet
in

never

no

he
saved
up
his

a
clean

ev

on

never
spoke
to
none
of
his

fear
they
shou

want
to

of
him
and
wos
altogether
in

an
uncommon
agreeable
character
he
had
his

vunce
a

and
contracted

what
did
he
do
that
for
inquired
pickwick
abruptly
for
he
was
considerably
startled
by
this
tragical
termination
of
the
narrative
wot
did
he
do
it
for
sir
reiterated
sam
wy
in
support
of
his
great
principle
that
crumpets
wos
wholesome
and
to
show
that
he
wouldn
t
be
put
out
of
his
way
for
nobody
with
such
like
shiftings
and
changings
of
the
discourse
did
weller
meet
his
master
s
questioning
on
the
night
of
his
taking
up
his
residence
in
the
fleet
finding
all
gentle
remonstrance
useless
pickwick
at
length
yielded
a
reluctant
consent
to
his
taking
lodgings
by
the
week
of
a
cobbler
who
rented
a
small
slip
room
in
one
of
the
upper
galleries
to
this
humble
apartment
weller
moved
a
mattress
and
bedding
which
he
hired
of
roker
and
by
the
time
he
lay
down
upon
it
at
night
was
as
much
at
home
as
if
he
had
been
bred
in
the
prison
and
his
whole
family
had
vegetated
therein
for
three
generations
do
you
always
smoke
arter
you
goes
to
bed
old
cock
inquired
weller
of
his
landlord
when
they
had
both
retired
for
the
night
yes
i
does
young
bantam
replied
the
cobbler
will
you
allow
me
to
wy
you
make
up
your
bed
under
that
ere
deal
table
said
sam
cause
i
was
always
used
to
a
afore
i
came
here
and
i
find
the
legs
of
the
table
answer
just
as
well
replied
the
cobbler
you
re
a
character
sir
said
sam
i
haven
t
got
anything
of
the
kind
belonging
to
me
rejoined
the
cobbler
shaking
his
head
and
if
you
want
to
meet
with
a
good
one
i
m
afraid
you
ll
find
some
difficulty
in
suiting
yourself
at
this
register
the
above
short
dialogue
took
place
as
weller
lay
extended
on
his
mattress
at
one
end
of
the
room
and
the
cobbler
on
his
at
the
other
the
apartment
being
illumined
by
the
light
of
a
and
the
cobbler
s
pipe
which
was
glowing
below
the
table
like
a
coal
the
conversation
brief
as
it
was
predisposed
weller
strongly
in
his
landlord
s
favour
and
raising
himself
on
his
elbow
he
took
a
more
lengthened
survey
of
his
appearance
than
he
had
yet
had
either
time
or
inclination
to
make
he
was
a
sallow
man
all
cobblers
are
and
had
a
strong
bristly
beard
all
cobblers
have
his
face
was
a
queer
piece
of
workmanship
ornamented
with
a
couple
of
eyes
that
must
have
worn
a
very
joyous
expression
at
one
time
for
they
sparkled
yet
the
man
was
sixty
by
years
and
heaven
knows
how
old
by
imprisonment
so
that
his
having
any
look
approaching
to
mirth
or
contentment
was
singular
enough
he
was
a
little
man
and
being
half
doubled
up
as
he
lay
in
bed
looked
about
as
long
as
he
ought
to
have
been
without
his
legs
he
had
a
great
red
pipe
in
his
mouth
and
was
smoking
and
staring
at
the
in
a
state
of
enviable
placidity
have
you
been
here
long
inquired
sam
breaking
the
silence
which
had
lasted
for
some
time
twelve
year
replied
the
cobbler
biting
the
end
of
his
pipe
as
he
spoke
contempt
inquired
sam
the
cobbler
nodded
well
then
said
sam
with
some
sternness
wot
do
you
persevere
in
bein
obstinit
for
vastin
your
precious
life
away
in
this
here
magnified
pound
wy
don
t
you
give
in
and
tell
the
chancellorship
that
you
re
wery
sorry
for
makin
his
court
contemptible
and
you
won
t
do
so
no
more
the
cobbler
put
his
pipe
in
the
corner
of
his
mouth
while
he
smiled
and
then
brought
it
back
to
its
old
place
again
but
said
nothing
wy
don
t
you
said
sam
urging
his
question
strenuously
ah
said
the
cobbler
you
don
t
quite
understand
these
matters
what
do
you
suppose
ruined
me
now
wy
said
sam
trimming
the
i
s
pose
the
beginnin
wos
that
you
got
into
debt
eh
never
owed
a
farden
said
the
cobbler
try
well
perhaps
said
sam
you
bought
houses
wich
is
delicate
english
for
goin
mad
or
took
to
buildin
wich
is
a
medical
term
for
bein
the
cobbler
shook
his
head
and
said
try
you
didn
t
go
to
law
i
hope
said
sam
suspiciously
never
in
my
life
replied
the
cobbler
the
fact
is
i
was
ruined
by
having
money
left
come
come
said
sam
that
von
t
do
i
wish
some
rich
enemy
ud
try
to
vork
my
destruction
in
that
ere
vay
i
d
let
oh
i
dare
say
you
don
t
believe
it
said
the
cobbler
quietly
smoking
his
pipe
i
wouldn
t
if
i
was
you
but
it
s
true
for
all
how
wos
it
inquired
sam
half
induced
to
believe
the
fact
already
by
the
look
the
cobbler
gave
him
just
this
replied
the
cobbler
an
old
gentleman
that
i
worked
for
down
in
the
country
and
a
humble
relation
of
whose
i
married
she
s
dead
god
bless
her
and
thank
him
for
it
was
seized
with
a
fit
and
went
where
inquired
sam
who
was
growing
sleepy
after
the
numerous
events
of
the
day
how
should
i
know
where
he
went
said
the
cobbler
speaking
through
his
nose
in
an
intense
enjoyment
of
his
pipe
he
went
off
oh
that
indeed
said
sam
well
well
said
the
cobbler
he
left
five
thousand
pound
behind
and
wery
in
him
so
to
do
said
sam
one
of
which
continued
the
cobbler
he
left
to
me
cause
i
married
his
relation
you
wery
good
murmured
sam
and
being
surrounded
by
a
great
number
of
nieces
and
nevys
as
was
always
quarrelling
and
fighting
among
themselves
for
the
property
he
makes
me
his
executor
and
leaves
the
rest
to
me
in
trust
to
divide
it
among
em
as
the
will
wot
do
you
mean
by
leavin
it
on
trust
inquired
sam
waking
up
a
little
if
it
ain
t
were
s
the
use
on
it
it
s
a
law
term
that
s
all
said
the
cobbler
i
don
t
think
that
said
sam
shaking
his
head
there
s
wery
little
trust
at
that
shop
hows
ever
go
well
said
the
cobbler
when
i
was
going
to
take
out
a
probate
of
the
will
the
nieces
and
nevys
who
was
desperately
disappointed
at
not
getting
all
the
money
enters
a
caveat
against
what
s
that
inquired
sam
a
legal
instrument
which
is
as
much
as
to
say
it
s
no
go
replied
the
cobbler
i
see
said
sam
a
sort
of
o
the
but
continued
the
cobbler
finding
that
they
couldn
t
agree
among
themselves
and
consequently
couldn
t
get
up
a
case
against
the
will
they
withdrew
the
caveat
and
i
paid
all
the
legacies
i
d
hardly
done
it
when
one
nevy
brings
an
action
to
set
the
will
aside
the
case
comes
on
some
months
afterwards
afore
a
deaf
old
gentleman
in
a
back
room
somewhere
down
by
paul
s
churchyard
and
arter
four
counsels
had
taken
a
day
to
bother
him
regularly
he
takes
a
week
or
two
to
consider
and
read
the
evidence
in
six
volumes
and
then
gives
his
judgment
that
how
the
testator
was
not
quite
right
in
his
head
and
i
must
pay
all
the
money
back
again
and
all
the
costs
i
appealed
the
case
come
on
before
three
or
four
very
sleepy
gentlemen
who
had
heard
it
all
before
in
the
other
court
where
they
re
lawyers
without
work
the
only
difference
being
that
there
they
re
called
doctors
and
in
the
other
place
delegates
if
you
understand
that
and
they
very
dutifully
confirmed
the
decision
of
the
old
gentleman
below
after
that
we
went
into
chancery
where
we
are
still
and
where
i
shall
always
be
my
lawyers
have
had
all
my
thousand
pound
long
ago
and
what
between
the
estate
as
they
call
it
and
the
costs
i
m
here
for
ten
thousand
and
shall
stop
here
till
i
die
mending
shoes
some
gentlemen
have
talked
of
bringing
it
before
parliament
and
i
dare
say
would
have
done
it
only
they
hadn
t
time
to
come
to
me
and
i
hadn
t
power
to
go
to
them
and
they
got
tired
of
my
long
letters
and
dropped
the
business
and
this
is
god
s
truth
without
one
word
of
suppression
or
exaggeration
as
fifty
people
both
in
this
place
and
out
of
it
very
well
the
cobbler
paused
to
ascertain
what
effect
his
story
had
produced
on
sam
but
finding
that
he
had
dropped
asleep
knocked
the
ashes
out
of
his
pipe
sighed
put
it
down
drew
the
over
his
head
and
went
to
sleep
too
pickwick
was
sitting
at
breakfast
alone
next
morning
sam
being
busily
engaged
in
the
cobbler
s
room
polishing
his
master
s
shoes
and
brushing
the
black
gaiters
when
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
which
before
pickwick
could
cry
come
in
was
followed
by
the
appearance
of
a
head
of
hair
and
a
cap
both
of
which
articles
of
dress
he
had
no
difficulty
in
recognising
as
the
personal
property
of
smangle
how
are
you
said
that
worthy
accompanying
the
inquiry
with
a
score
or
two
of
nods
i
say
do
you
expect
anybody
this
morning
three
men
devilish
gentlemanly
fellows
have
been
asking
after
you
downstairs
and
knocking
at
every
door
on
the
hall
flight
for
which
they
ve
been
most
infernally
blown
up
by
the
collegians
that
had
the
trouble
of
opening
dear
me
how
very
foolish
of
them
said
pickwick
rising
yes
i
have
no
doubt
they
are
some
friends
whom
i
rather
expected
to
see
friends
of
yours
exclaimed
smangle
seizing
pickwick
by
the
hand
say
no
more
curse
me
they
re
friends
of
mine
from
this
minute
and
friends
of
mivins
s
too
infernal
pleasant
gentlemanly
dog
mivins
isn
t
he
said
smangle
with
great
feeling
i
know
so
little
of
the
gentleman
said
pickwick
hesitating
that
i
i
know
you
do
interrupted
smangle
clasping
pickwick
by
the
shoulder
you
shall
know
him
better
you
ll
be
delighted
with
him
that
man
sir
said
smangle
with
a
solemn
countenance
has
comic
powers
that
would
do
honour
to
drury
lane
has
he
indeed
said
pickwick
ah
by
jove
he
has
replied
smangle
hear
him
come
the
four
cats
in
the
four
distinct
cats
sir
i
pledge
you
my
honour
now
you
know
that
s
infernal
clever
damme
you
can
t
help
liking
a
man
when
you
see
these
traits
about
him
he
s
only
one
fault
that
little
failing
i
mentioned
to
you
you
as
smangle
shook
his
head
in
a
confidential
and
sympathising
manner
at
this
juncture
pickwick
felt
that
he
was
expected
to
say
something
so
he
said
ah
and
looked
restlessly
at
the
door
ah
echoed
smangle
with
a
sigh
he
s
delightful
company
that
man
is
sir
i
don
t
know
better
company
anywhere
but
he
has
that
one
drawback
if
the
ghost
of
his
grandfather
sir
was
to
rise
before
him
this
minute
he
d
ask
him
for
the
loan
of
his
acceptance
on
an
eightpenny
dear
me
exclaimed
pickwick
yes
added
smangle
and
if
he
d
the
power
of
raising
him
again
he
would
in
two
months
and
three
days
from
this
time
to
renew
the
bill
those
are
very
remarkable
traits
said
pickwick
but
i
m
afraid
that
while
we
are
talking
here
my
friends
may
be
in
a
state
of
great
perplexity
at
not
finding
i
ll
show
em
the
way
said
smangle
making
for
the
door
i
won
t
disturb
you
while
they
re
here
you
know
by
the
bye
as
smangle
pronounced
the
last
three
words
he
stopped
suddenly
reclosed
the
door
which
he
had
opened
and
walking
softly
back
to
pickwick
stepped
close
up
to
him
on
tiptoe
and
said
in
a
very
soft
whisper
you
couldn
t
make
it
convenient
to
lend
me
till
the
latter
end
of
next
week
could
you
pickwick
could
scarcely
forbear
smiling
but
managing
to
preserve
his
gravity
he
drew
forth
the
coin
and
placed
it
in
smangle
s
palm
upon
which
that
gentleman
with
many
nods
and
winks
implying
profound
mystery
disappeared
in
quest
of
the
three
strangers
with
whom
he
presently
returned
and
having
coughed
thrice
and
nodded
as
many
times
as
an
assurance
to
pickwick
that
he
would
not
forget
to
pay
he
shook
hands
all
round
in
an
engaging
manner
and
at
length
took
himself
off
my
dear
friends
said
pickwick
shaking
hands
alternately
with
tupman
winkle
and
snodgrass
who
were
the
three
visitors
in
question
i
am
delighted
to
see
the
triumvirate
were
much
affected
tupman
shook
his
head
deploringly
snodgrass
drew
forth
his
handkerchief
with
undisguised
emotion
and
winkle
retired
to
the
window
and
sniffed
aloud
mornin
gen
l
m
n
said
sam
entering
at
the
moment
with
the
shoes
and
gaiters
avay
vith
melincholly
as
the
little
boy
said
ven
his
schoolmissus
died
velcome
to
the
college
gen
l
m
this
foolish
fellow
said
pickwick
tapping
sam
on
the
head
as
he
knelt
down
to
button
up
his
master
s
gaiters
this
foolish
fellow
has
got
himself
arrested
in
order
to
be
near
what
exclaimed
the
three
friends
yes
gen
l
m
n
said
sam
i
m
a
stand
steady
sir
if
you
please
i
m
a
prisoner
gen
l
m
n
as
the
lady
a
prisoner
exclaimed
winkle
with
unaccountable
vehemence
hollo
sir
responded
sam
looking
up
wot
s
the
matter
sir
i
had
hoped
sam
that
nothing
nothing
said
winkle
precipitately
there
was
something
so
very
abrupt
and
unsettled
in
winkle
s
manner
that
pickwick
involuntarily
looked
at
his
two
friends
for
an
explanation
we
don
t
know
said
tupman
answering
this
mute
appeal
aloud
he
has
been
much
excited
for
two
days
past
and
his
whole
demeanour
very
unlike
what
it
usually
is
we
feared
there
must
be
something
the
matter
but
he
resolutely
denies
no
no
said
winkle
colouring
beneath
pickwick
s
gaze
there
is
really
nothing
i
assure
you
there
is
nothing
my
dear
sir
it
will
be
necessary
for
me
to
leave
town
for
a
short
time
on
private
business
and
i
had
hoped
to
have
prevailed
upon
you
to
allow
sam
to
accompany
pickwick
looked
more
astonished
than
before
i
think
faltered
winkle
that
sam
would
have
had
no
objection
to
do
so
but
of
course
his
being
a
prisoner
here
renders
it
impossible
so
i
must
go
as
winkle
said
these
words
pickwick
felt
with
some
astonishment
that
sam
s
fingers
were
trembling
at
the
gaiters
as
if
he
were
rather
surprised
or
startled
sam
looked
up
at
winkle
too
when
he
had
finished
speaking
and
though
the
glance
they
exchanged
was
instantaneous
they
seemed
to
understand
each
other
do
you
know
anything
of
this
sam
said
pickwick
sharply
no
i
don
t
sir
replied
weller
beginning
to
button
with
extraordinary
assiduity
are
you
sure
sam
said
pickwick
wy
sir
responded
weller
i
m
sure
so
far
that
i
ve
never
heerd
anythin
on
the
subject
afore
this
moment
if
i
makes
any
guess
about
it
added
sam
looking
at
winkle
i
haven
t
got
any
right
to
say
what
it
is
fear
it
should
be
a
wrong
i
have
no
right
to
make
any
further
inquiry
into
the
private
affairs
of
a
friend
however
intimate
a
friend
said
pickwick
after
a
short
silence
at
present
let
me
merely
say
that
i
do
not
understand
this
at
all
there
we
have
had
quite
enough
of
the
thus
expressing
himself
pickwick
led
the
conversation
to
different
topics
and
winkle
gradually
appeared
more
at
ease
though
still
very
far
from
being
completely
so
they
had
all
so
much
to
converse
about
that
the
morning
very
quickly
passed
away
and
when
at
three
o
clock
weller
produced
upon
the
little
a
roast
leg
of
mutton
and
an
enormous
with
sundry
dishes
of
vegetables
and
pots
of
porter
which
stood
upon
the
chairs
or
the
sofa
bedstead
or
where
they
could
everybody
felt
disposed
to
do
justice
to
the
meal
notwithstanding
that
the
meat
had
been
purchased
and
dressed
and
the
pie
made
and
baked
at
the
prison
cookery
hard
by
to
these
succeeded
a
bottle
or
two
of
very
good
wine
for
which
a
messenger
was
despatched
by
pickwick
to
the
horn
in
doctors
commons
the
bottle
or
two
indeed
might
be
more
properly
described
as
a
bottle
or
six
for
by
the
time
it
was
drunk
and
tea
over
the
bell
began
to
ring
for
strangers
to
withdraw
but
if
winkle
s
behaviour
had
been
unaccountable
in
the
morning
it
became
perfectly
unearthly
and
solemn
when
under
the
influence
of
his
feelings
and
his
share
of
the
bottle
or
six
he
prepared
to
take
leave
of
his
friend
he
lingered
behind
until
tupman
and
snodgrass
had
disappeared
and
then
fervently
clenched
pickwick
s
hand
with
an
expression
of
face
in
which
deep
and
mighty
resolve
was
fearfully
blended
with
the
very
concentrated
essence
of
gloom
my
dear
sir
said
winkle
between
his
set
teeth
bless
you
my
dear
fellow
replied
the
pickwick
as
he
returned
the
pressure
of
his
young
friend
s
hand
now
then
cried
tupman
from
the
gallery
yes
yes
directly
replied
winkle
said
pickwick
there
was
another
and
another
and
half
a
dozen
more
after
that
and
still
winkle
had
fast
hold
of
his
friend
s
hand
and
was
looking
into
his
face
with
the
same
strange
expression
is
anything
the
matter
said
pickwick
at
last
when
his
arm
was
quite
sore
with
shaking
nothing
said
winkle
well
then
said
pickwick
attempting
to
disengage
his
hand
my
friend
my
benefactor
my
honoured
companion
murmured
winkle
catching
at
his
wrist
do
not
judge
me
harshly
do
not
when
you
hear
that
driven
to
extremity
by
hopeless
obstacles
i
now
then
said
tupman
reappearing
at
the
door
are
you
coming
or
are
we
to
be
locked
in
yes
yes
i
am
ready
replied
winkle
and
with
a
violent
effort
he
tore
himself
away
as
pickwick
was
gazing
down
the
passage
after
them
in
silent
astonishment
sam
weller
appeared
at
the
and
whispered
for
one
moment
in
winkle
s
ear
oh
certainly
depend
upon
me
said
that
gentleman
aloud
thank
ee
sir
you
won
t
forget
sir
said
sam
of
course
not
replied
winkle
wish
you
luck
sir
said
sam
touching
his
hat
i
should
very
much
liked
to
ha
joined
you
sir
but
the
gov
nor
o
course
is
it
is
very
much
to
your
credit
that
you
remain
here
said
winkle
with
these
words
they
disappeared
down
the
stairs
very
extraordinary
said
pickwick
going
back
into
his
room
and
seating
himself
at
the
table
in
a
musing
attitude
what
can
that
young
man
be
going
to
do
he
had
sat
ruminating
about
the
matter
for
some
time
when
the
voice
of
roker
the
turnkey
demanded
whether
he
might
come
in
by
all
means
said
pickwick
i
ve
brought
you
a
softer
pillow
sir
said
roker
instead
of
the
temporary
one
you
had
last
thank
you
said
pickwick
will
you
take
a
glass
of
wine
you
re
wery
good
sir
replied
roker
accepting
the
proffered
glass
yours
thank
you
said
pickwick
i
m
sorry
to
say
that
your
landlord
s
wery
bad
sir
said
roker
setting
down
the
glass
and
inspecting
the
lining
of
his
hat
preparatory
to
putting
it
on
again
what
the
chancery
prisoner
exclaimed
pickwick
he
won
t
be
a
chancery
prisoner
wery
long
sir
replied
roker
turning
his
hat
round
so
as
to
get
the
maker
s
name
right
side
upwards
as
he
looked
into
it
you
make
my
blood
run
cold
said
pickwick
what
do
you
mean
he
s
been
consumptive
for
a
long
time
past
said
roker
and
he
s
taken
wery
bad
in
the
breath
the
doctor
said
six
months
ago
that
nothing
but
change
of
air
could
save
great
heaven
exclaimed
pickwick
has
this
man
been
slowly
murdered
by
the
law
for
six
months
i
don
t
know
about
that
replied
roker
weighing
the
hat
by
the
brim
in
both
hands
i
suppose
he
d
have
been
took
the
same
wherever
he
was
he
went
into
the
infirmary
this
morning
the
doctor
says
his
strength
is
to
be
kept
up
as
much
as
possible
and
the
warden
s
sent
him
wine
and
broth
and
that
from
his
own
house
it
s
not
the
warden
s
fault
you
know
of
course
not
replied
pickwick
hastily
i
m
afraid
however
said
roker
shaking
his
head
that
it
s
all
up
with
him
i
offered
neddy
two
orths
to
one
upon
it
just
now
but
he
wouldn
t
take
it
and
quite
right
thank
ee
sir
stay
said
pickwick
earnestly
where
is
this
infirmary
just
over
where
you
slept
sir
replied
roker
i
ll
show
you
if
you
like
to
pickwick
snatched
up
his
hat
without
speaking
and
followed
at
once
the
turnkey
led
the
way
in
silence
and
gently
raising
the
latch
of
the
room
door
motioned
pickwick
to
enter
it
was
a
large
bare
desolate
room
with
a
number
of
stump
bedsteads
made
of
iron
on
one
of
which
lay
stretched
the
shadow
of
a
man
wan
pale
and
ghastly
his
breathing
was
hard
and
thick
and
he
moaned
painfully
as
it
came
and
went
at
the
bedside
sat
a
short
old
man
in
a
cobbler
s
apron
who
by
the
aid
of
a
pair
of
horn
spectacles
was
reading
from
the
bible
aloud
it
was
the
fortunate
legatee
the
sick
man
laid
his
hand
upon
his
attendant
s
arm
and
motioned
him
to
stop
he
closed
the
book
and
laid
it
on
the
bed
open
the
window
said
the
sick
man
he
did
so
the
noise
of
carriages
and
carts
the
rattle
of
wheels
the
cries
of
men
and
boys
all
the
busy
sounds
of
a
mighty
multitude
instinct
with
life
and
occupation
blended
into
one
deep
murmur
floated
into
the
room
above
the
hoarse
loud
hum
arose
from
time
to
time
a
boisterous
laugh
or
a
scrap
of
some
jingling
song
shouted
forth
by
one
of
the
giddy
crowd
would
strike
upon
the
ear
for
an
instant
and
then
be
lost
amidst
the
roar
of
voices
and
the
tramp
of
footsteps
the
breaking
of
the
billows
of
the
restless
sea
of
life
that
rolled
heavily
on
without
these
are
melancholy
sounds
to
a
quiet
listener
at
any
time
but
how
melancholy
to
the
watcher
by
the
bed
of
death
there
is
no
air
here
said
the
man
faintly
the
place
pollutes
it
it
was
fresh
round
about
when
i
walked
there
years
ago
but
it
grows
hot
and
heavy
in
passing
these
walls
i
can
not
breathe
we
have
breathed
it
together
for
a
long
time
said
the
old
man
come
there
was
a
short
silence
during
which
the
two
spectators
approached
the
bed
the
sick
man
drew
a
hand
of
his
old
towards
him
and
pressing
it
affectionately
between
both
his
own
retained
it
in
his
grasp
i
hope
he
gasped
after
a
while
so
faintly
that
they
bent
their
ears
close
over
the
bed
to
catch
the
sounds
his
pale
lips
gave
vent
to
i
hope
my
merciful
judge
will
bear
in
mind
my
heavy
punishment
on
earth
twenty
years
my
friend
twenty
years
in
this
hideous
grave
my
heart
broke
when

chapter

descriptive
of
an
affecting
interview
between
samuel
weller
and
a
family
party
pickwick
makes
a
tour
of
the
diminutive
world
he
inhabits
and
resolves
to
mix
with
it
in
future
as
little
as
possible
a
few
mornings
after
his
incarceration
samuel
weller
having
arranged
his
master
s
room
with
all
possible
care
and
seen
him
comfortably
seated
over
his
books
and
papers
withdrew
to
employ
himself
for
an
hour
or
two
to
come
as
he
best
could
it
was
a
fine
morning
and
it
occurred
to
sam
that
a
pint
of
porter
in
the
open
air
would
lighten
his
next
quarter
of
an
hour
or
so
as
well
as
any
little
amusement
in
which
he
could
indulge
having
arrived
at
this
conclusion
he
betook
himself
to
the
tap
having
purchased
the
beer
and
obtained
moreover
the
yesterday
s
paper
he
repaired
to
the
and
seating
himself
on
a
bench
proceeded
to
enjoy
himself
in
a
very
sedate
and
methodical
manner
first
of
all
he
took
a
refreshing
draught
of
the
beer
and
then
he
looked
up
at
a
window
and
bestowed
a
platonic
wink
on
a
young
lady
who
was
peeling
potatoes
thereat
then
he
opened
the
paper
and
folded
it
so
as
to
get
the
police
reports
outwards
and
this
being
a
vexatious
and
difficult
thing
to
do
when
there
is
any
wind
stirring
he
took
another
draught
of
the
beer
when
he
had
accomplished
it
then
he
read
two
lines
of
the
paper
and
stopped
short
to
look
at
a
couple
of
men
who
were
finishing
a
game
at
rackets
which
being
concluded
he
cried
out
wery
good
in
an
approving
manner
and
looked
round
upon
the
spectators
to
ascertain
whether
their
sentiments
coincided
with
his
own
this
involved
the
necessity
of
looking
up
at
the
windows
also
and
as
the
young
lady
was
still
there
it
was
an
act
of
common
politeness
to
wink
again
and
to
drink
to
her
good
health
in
dumb
show
in
another
draught
of
the
beer
which
sam
did
and
having
frowned
hideously
upon
a
small
boy
who
had
noted
this
latter
proceeding
with
open
eyes
he
threw
one
leg
over
the
other
and
holding
the
newspaper
in
both
hands
began
to
read
in
real
earnest
he
had
hardly
composed
himself
into
the
needful
state
of
abstraction
when
he
thought
he
heard
his
own
name
proclaimed
in
some
distant
passage
nor
was
he
mistaken
for
it
quickly
passed
from
mouth
to
mouth
and
in
a
few
seconds
the
air
teemed
with
shouts
of
weller
here
roared
sam
in
a
stentorian
voice
wot
s
the
matter
who
wants
him
has
an
express
come
to
say
that
his
country
house
is
afire
somebody

blessed
if

bar

couldn
t
make
more
noise
about
it
accompanying
these
words
with
a
gentle
rap
on
the
head
of
the
young
gentleman
before
noticed
who
unconscious
of
his
close
vicinity
to
the
person
in
request
was
screaming
weller
with
all
his
might
sam
hastened
across
the
ground
and
ran
up
the
steps
into
the
hall
here
the
first
object
that
met
his
eyes
was
his
beloved
father
sitting
on
a
bottom
stair
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
shouting
out
weller
in
his
very
loudest
tone
at
intervals
wot

you
at
said
sam
impetuously
when
the
old
gentleman
had
discharged
himself
of
another
shout
making
yourself
so
precious
hot
that
you
looks
like

aggrawated

the

shook
his
head
from

and
was
seized
with
a
hoarse
internal
rumbling
accompanied
with
a
violent
swelling
of
the
countenance
and
a
sudden
increase
in
the
breadth
of

to
the
door
of
the
snuggery
into
which
sam
pausing
for
an
instant
to
look
over
his
shoulder
and
cast
a
sly
leer
at
his
respected
progenitor
who

still

at
this
point
of
the
conversation
a
sound
indecorously
approaching
to
a
laugh
was
heard
to
proceed
from
the
chair
in
which
the
elder
weller
was
seated
upon
which
weller
on
a
hasty
consideration
of
all
the
circumstances
of
the
case
considered
it
her
bounden
duty
to
become
gradually
hysterical
weller
said
the
old

seated

a
corner

sam
looking

rejoined
stiggins
in
the
same
vere
may
that

sir
inquired
sam
with
great
outward
simplicity
in
the
buzzim
young
man
replied
stiggins
placing
his
umbrella
on
his
waistcoat
at
this
affecting
reply
weller
being
wholly
unable
to
suppress
her
feelings
sobbed
aloud
and
stated
her
conviction
that
the
man
was
a
saint
whereupon
weller
senior
ventured
to
suggest
in
an
undertone
that
he
must
be
the
representative
of
the
united
parishes
of
simon
without
and
walker
within
i
m
afeered
mum
said
sam
that
this
here
gen
l
m
n
with
the
twist
in
his
countenance
feels
rather
thirsty
with
the
melancholy
spectacle
afore
him
is
it
the
case
mum
the
worthy
lady
looked
at
stiggins
for
a
reply
that
gentleman
with
many
rollings
of
the
eye
clenched
his
throat
with
his
right
hand
and
mimicked
the
act
of
swallowing
to
intimate
that
he
was
athirst
i
am
afraid
samuel
that
his
feelings
have
made
him
so
indeed
said
weller
mournfully
wot
s
your
usual
tap
sir
replied
sam
oh
my
dear
young
friend
replied
stiggins
all
taps
is
vanities
too
true
too
true
indeed
said
weller
murmuring
a
groan
and
shaking
her
head
assentingly
well
said
sam
i
they
may
be
sir
but
wich
is
your
partickler
wanity
wich
wanity
do
you
like
the
flavour
on
best
sir
oh
my
dear
young
friend
replied
stiggins
i
despise
them
all
if
said
stiggins
if
there
is
any
one
of
them
less
odious
than
another
it
is
the
liquor
called
rum
warm
my
dear
young
friend
with
three
lumps
of
sugar
to
the
wery
sorry
to
say
sir
said
sam
that
they
don
t
allow
that
particular
wanity
to
be
sold
in
this
here
oh
the
hardness
of
heart
of
these
inveterate
men
ejaculated
stiggins
oh
the
accursed
cruelty
of
these
inhuman
persecutors
with
these
words
stiggins
again
cast
up
his
eyes
and
rapped
his
breast
with
his
umbrella
and
it
is
but
justice
to
the
reverend
gentleman
to
say
that
his
indignation
appeared
very
real
and
unfeigned
indeed
after
weller
and
the
gentleman
had
commented
on
this
inhuman
usage
in
a
very
forcible
manner
and
had
vented
a
variety
of
pious
and
holy
execrations
against
its
authors
the
latter
recommended
a
bottle
of
port
wine
warmed
with
a
little
water
spice
and
sugar
as
being
grateful
to
the
stomach
and
savouring
less
of
vanity
than
many
other
compounds
it
was
accordingly
ordered
to
be
prepared
and
pending
its
preparation
the
man
and
weller
looked
at
the
elder
and
groaned
well
sammy
said
the
gentleman
i
hope
you
ll
find
your
spirits
rose
by
this
here
lively
wisit
wery
cheerful
and
improvin
conwersation
ain
t
it
sammy
you
re
a
reprobate
replied
sam
and
i
desire
you
won
t
address
no
more
o
them
ungraceful
remarks
to
so
far
from
being
edified
by
this
very
proper
reply
the
elder
weller
at
once
relapsed
into
a
broad
grin
and
this
inexorable
conduct
causing
the
lady
and
stiggins
to
close
their
eyes
and
rock
themselves
to
and
fro
on
their
chairs
in
a
troubled
manner
he
furthermore
indulged
in
several
acts
of
pantomime
indicative
of
a
desire
to
pummel
and
wring
the
nose
of
the
aforesaid
stiggins
the
performance
of
which
appeared
to
afford
him
great
mental
relief
the
old
gentleman
very
narrowly
escaped
detection
in
one
instance
for
stiggins
happening
to
give
a
start
on
the
arrival
of
the
negus
brought
his
head
in
smart
contact
with
the
clenched
fist
with
which
weller
had
been
describing
imaginary
fireworks
in
the
air
within
two
inches
of
his
ear
for
some
minutes
wot
are
you
out
your
hand
for
the
tumbler

with
great
promptitude

didn

to

said
weller
in
some
degree
abashed
by
the
very
unexpected
occurrence
of
the
incident
try
an
in
ard
application
sir
said
sam
as
the
gentleman
rubbed
his
head
with
a
rueful
visage
wot
do
you
think
o
that
for
a
go
o
wanity
warm
sir
stiggins
made
no
verbal
answer
but
his
manner
was
expressive
he
tasted
the
contents
of
the
glass
which
sam
had
placed
in
his
hand
put
his
umbrella
on
the
floor
and
tasted
it
again
passing
his
hand
placidly
across
his
stomach
twice
or
thrice
he
then
drank
the
whole
at
a
breath
and
smacking
his
lips
held
out
the
tumbler
for
more
nor
was
weller
in
doing
justice
to
the
composition
the
good
lady
began
by
protesting
that
she
couldn
t
touch
a
drop
then
took
a
small
drop
then
a
large
drop
then
a
great
many
drops
and
her
feelings
being
of
the
nature
of
those
substances
which
are
powerfully
affected
by
the
application
of
strong
waters
she
dropped
a
tear
with
every
drop
of
negus
and
so
got
on
melting
the
feelings
down
until
at
length
she
had
arrived
at
a
very
pathetic
and
decent
pitch
of
misery
the
elder
weller
observed
these
signs
and
tokens
with
many
manifestations
of
disgust
and
when
after
a
second
jug
of
the
same
stiggins
began
to
sigh
in
a
dismal
manner
he
plainly
evinced
his
disapprobation
of
the
whole
proceedings
by
sundry
incoherent
ramblings
of
speech
among
which
frequent
angry
repetitions
of
the
word
gammon
were
alone
distinguishable
to
the
ear
i
ll
tell
you
wot
it
is
samivel
my
boy
whispered
the
old
gentleman
into
his
son
s
ear
after
a
long
and
steadfast
contemplation
of
his
lady
and
stiggins
i
think
there
must
be
somethin
wrong
in
your
s
inside
as
vell
as
in
that
o
the
wot
do
you
mean
said
sam
i
mean
this
here
sammy
replied
the
old
gentleman
that
wot
they
drink
don
t
seem
no
nourishment
to
em
it
all
turns
to
warm
water
and
comes
out
o
their
eyes
pend
upon
it
sammy
it
s
a
constitootional
weller
delivered
this
scientific
opinion
with
many
confirmatory
frowns
and
nods
which
weller
remarking
and
concluding
that
they
bore
some
disparaging
reference
either
to
herself
or
to
stiggins
or
to
both
was
on
the
point
of
becoming
infinitely
worse
when
stiggins
getting
on
his
legs
as
well
as
he
could
proceeded
to
deliver
an
edifying
discourse
for
the
benefit
of
the
company
but
more
especially
of
samuel
whom
he
adjured
in
moving
terms
to
be
upon
his
guard
in
that
sink
of
iniquity
into
which
he
was
cast
to
abstain
from
all
hypocrisy
and
pride
of
heart
and
to
take
in
all
things
exact
pattern
and
copy
by
him
stiggins
in
which
case
he
might
calculate
on
arriving
sooner
or
later
at
the
comfortable
conclusion
that
like
him
he
was
a
most
estimable
and
blameless
character
and
that
all
his
acquaintances
and
friends
were
hopelessly
abandoned
and
profligate
wretches
which
consideration
he
said
could
not
but
afford
him
the
liveliest
satisfaction
he
furthermore
conjured
him
to
avoid
above
all
things
the
vice
of
intoxication
which
he
likened
unto
the
filthy
habits
of
swine
and
to
those
poisonous
and
baleful
drugs
which
being
chewed
in
the
mouth
are
said
to
filch
away
the
memory
at
this
point
of
his
discourse
the
reverend
and
gentleman
became
singularly
incoherent
and
staggering
to
and
fro
in
the
excitement
of
his
eloquence
was
fain
to
catch
at
the
back
of
a
chair
to
preserve
his
perpendicular
stiggins
did
not
desire
his
hearers
to
be
upon
their
guard
against
those
false
prophets
and
wretched
mockers
of
religion
who
without
sense
to
expound
its
first
doctrines
or
hearts
to
feel
its
first
principles
are
more
dangerous
members
of
society
than
the
common
criminal
imposing
as
they
necessarily
do
upon
the
weakest
and
worst
informed
casting
scorn
and
contempt
on
what
should
be
held
most
sacred
and
bringing
into
partial
disrepute
large
bodies
of
virtuous
and
conducted
persons
of
many
excellent
sects
and
persuasions
but
as
he
leaned
over
the
back
of
the
chair
for
a
considerable
time
and
closing
one
eye
winked
a
good
deal
with
the
other
it
is
presumed
that
he
thought
all
this
but
kept
it
to
himself
during
the
delivery
of
the
oration
weller
sobbed
and
wept
at
the
end
of
the
paragraphs
while
sam
sitting
on
a
chair
and
resting
his
arms
on
the
top
rail
regarded
the
speaker
with
great
suavity
and
blandness
of
demeanour
occasionally
bestowing
a
look
of
recognition
on
the
old
gentleman
who
was
delighted
at
the
beginning
and
went
to
sleep
about
brayvo
wery
pretty
said
sam
when
the
man
having
finished
pulled
his
worn
gloves
on
thereby
thrusting
his
fingers
through
the
broken
tops
till
the
knuckles
were
disclosed
to
view
wery
i
hope
it
may
do
you
good

weller
solemnly

or

with
the
shepherd
in
at
this
supposition
the
reverend
stiggins
in
evident
consternation
gathered
up
his
hat
and
umbrella
and
proposed
an
immediate
departure
to
which
weller
assented
sam
walked
with
them
to
the
lodge
gate
and
took
a
dutiful
leave

the

em
up
weller
delivered
this
hurried
abstract
of
his
plot
with
great
vehemence
of
whisper
and
then
as
if
fearful
of
weakening
the
effect
of
the
tremendous
communication
by
any
further
dialogue
he
gave
the
coachman
s
salute
and
vanished
sam
had
scarcely
recovered
his
usual
composure
of
countenance
which
had
been
greatly
disturbed
by
the
secret
communication
of
his
respected
relative
when
pickwick
accosted
him
sam
said
that
gentleman
sir
replied
weller
i
am
going
for
a
walk
round
the
prison
and
i
wish
you
to
attend
me
i
see
a
prisoner
we
know
coming
this
way
sam
said
pickwick
smiling
wich
sir
inquired
weller
the
gen
l
m
n
vith
the
head
o
hair
or
the
interestin
captive
in
the
stockin
s
neither
rejoined
pickwick
he
is
an
older
friend
of
yours
o
mine
sir
exclaimed
weller
you
recollect
the
gentleman
very
well
i
dare
say
sam
replied
pickwick
or
else
you
are
more
unmindful
of
your
old
acquaintances
than
i
think
you
are
hush
not
a
word
sam
not
a
syllable
here
he
as
pickwick
spoke
jingle
walked
up
he
looked
less
miserable
than
before
being
clad
in
a
suit
of
clothes
which
with
pickwick
s
assistance
had
been
released
from
the
pawnbroker
s
he
wore
clean
linen
too
and
had
had
his
hair
cut
he
was
very
pale
and
thin
however
and
as
he
crept
slowly
up
leaning
on
a
stick
it
was
easy
to
see
that
he
had
suffered
severely
from
illness
and
want
and
was
still
very
weak
he
took
off
his
hat
as
pickwick
saluted
him
and
seemed
much
humbled
and
abashed
at
the
sight
of
sam
weller
following
close
at
his
heels
came
job
trotter
in
the
catalogue
of
whose
vices
want
of
faith
and
attachment
to
his
companion
could
at
all
events
find
no
place
he
was
still
ragged
and
squalid
but
his
face
was
not
quite
so
hollow
as
on
his
first
meeting
with
pickwick
a
few
days
before
as
he
took
off
his
hat
to
our
benevolent
old
friend
he
murmured
some
broken
expressions
of
gratitude
and
muttered
something
about
having
been
saved
from
starving
well
well
said
pickwick
impatiently
interrupting
him
you
can
follow
with
sam
i
want
to
speak
to
you
jingle
can
you
walk
without
his
arm
certainly
sir
all
ready
not
too
fast
legs
shaky
head
queer
round
and
round
earthquaky
sort
of
feeling
here
give
me
your
arm
said
pickwick
no
no
replied
jingle
won
t
indeed
rather
nonsense
said
pickwick
lean
upon
me
i
desire
seeing
that
he
was
confused
and
agitated
and
uncertain
what
to
do
pickwick
cut
the
matter
short
by
drawing
the
invalided
stroller
s
arm
through
his
and
leading
him
away
without
saying
another
word
about
it
during
the
whole
of
this
time
the
countenance
of
samuel
weller
had
exhibited
an
expression
of
the
most
overwhelming
and
absorbing
astonishment
that
the
imagination
can
portray
after
looking
from
job
to
jingle
and
from
jingle
to
job
in
profound
silence
he
softly
ejaculated
the
words
well
i
damn
d
which
he
repeated
at
least
a
score
of
times
after
which
exertion
he
appeared
wholly
bereft
of
speech
and
again
cast
his
eyes
first
upon
the
one
and
then
upon
the
other
in
mute
perplexity
and
bewilderment
now
sam
said
pickwick
looking
back
i
m
sir
replied
weller
mechanically
following
his
master
and
still
he
lifted
not
his
eyes
from
job
trotter
who
walked
at
his
side
in
silence
job
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
for
some
time
sam
with
his
glued
to
job
s
countenance
ran
up
against
the
people
who
were
walking
about
and
fell
over
little
children
and
stumbled
against
steps
and
railings
without
appearing
at
all
sensible
of
it
until
job
looking
stealthily
up
said
how
do
you
do
weller
it
him
exclaimed
sam
and
having
established
job
s
identity
beyond
all
doubt
he
smote
his
leg
and
vented
his
feelings
in
a
long
shrill
whistle
things
has
altered
with
me
sir
said
job
i
should
think
they
had
exclaimed
weller
surveying
his
companion
s
rags
with
undisguised
wonder
this
is
rayther
a
change
for
the
worse
trotter
as
the
gen
l
m
n
said
wen
he
got
two
doubtful
shillin
s
and
sixpenn
orth
o
for
a
good
it
is
indeed
replied
job
shaking
his
head
there
is
no
deception
now
weller
tears
said
job
with
a
look
of
momentary
slyness
tears
are
not
the
only
proofs
of
distress
nor
the
best
no
they
ain
t
replied
sam
expressively
they
may
be
put
on
weller
said
job
i
know
they
may
said
sam
some
people
indeed
has
em
always
ready
laid
on
and
can
pull
out
the
plug
wenever
they
yes
replied
job
but
these
sort
of
things
are
not
so
easily
counterfeited
weller
and
it
is
a
more
painful
process
to
get
them
as
he
spoke
he
pointed
to
his
sallow
sunken
cheeks
and
drawing
up
his
coat
sleeve
disclosed
an
arm
which
looked
as
if
the
bone
could
be
broken
at
a
touch
so
sharp
and
brittle
did
it
appear
beneath
its
thin
covering
of
flesh
wot
have
you
been
to
yourself
said
sam
recoiling
nothing
replied
job
nothin
echoed
sam
i
have
been
doin
nothing
for
many
weeks
past
said
job
and
eating
and
drinking
almost
as
sam
took
one
comprehensive
glance
at
trotter
s
thin
face
and
wretched
apparel
and
then
seizing
him
by
the
arm
commenced
dragging
him
away
with
great
violence
where
are
you
going
weller
said
job
vainly
struggling
in
the
powerful
grasp
of
his
old
enemy
come
on
said
sam
come
on
he
deigned
no
further
explanation
till
they
reached
the
tap
and
then
called
for
a
pot
of
porter
which
was
speedily
produced
now
said
sam
drink
that
up
ev
ry
drop
on
it
and
then
turn
the
pot
upside
down
to
let
me
see
as
you
ve
took
the
but
my
dear
weller
remonstrated
job
down
vith
it
said
sam
peremptorily
thus
admonished
trotter
raised
the
pot
to
his
lips
and
by
gentle
and
almost
imperceptible
degrees
tilted
it
into
the
air
he
paused
once
and
only
once
to
draw
a
long
breath
but
without
raising
his
face
from
the
vessel
which
in
a
few
moments
thereafter
he
held
out
at
arm
s
length
bottom
upward
nothing
fell
upon
the
ground
but
a
few
particles
of
froth
which
slowly
detached
themselves
from
the
rim
and
trickled
lazily
down
well
done
said
sam

you
find
yourself
arter
it
better
sir

defiance

buttoned
up
his
change
in
a
side
pocket
and
with
many
confirmatory
nods
and
gestures
by
the
way
proceeded
in
search
of
the
subject
of
discourse
they
found
pickwick
in
company
with
jingle
talking
very
earnestly
and
not
bestowing
a
look
on
the
groups
who
were
congregated
on
the
they
were
very
motley
groups
too
and
worth
the
looking
at
if
it
were
only
in
idle
curiosity
well
said
pickwick
as
sam
and
his
companion
drew
nigh
you
will
see
how
your
health
becomes
and
think
about
it
meanwhile
make
the
statement
out
for
me
when
you
feel
yourself
equal
to
the
task

the
subject
with

considered
it
now

room
you
are
tired
and
not
strong
enough
to
be
out
alfred
jingle
without
one
spark
of
his
old
animation
with
nothing
even
of
the
dismal
gaiety
which
he
had
assumed
when
pickwick
first
stumbled
on
him
in
his
misery
bowed
low
without
speaking
and
motioning
to
job
not
to
follow
him
just
yet
crept
slowly
away
curious
scene
this
is
it
not
sam
said
pickwick
looking
humouredly
round
wery
much
so
sir
replied
sam
wonders
ull
never
cease
added
sam
speaking
to
himself
i
m
wery
much
mistaken
if
that
ere
jingle
worn
t
somethin
in
the
way
the
area
formed
by
the
wall
in
that
part
of
the
fleet
in
which
pickwick
stood
was
just
wide
enough
to
make
a
good
one
side
being
formed
of
course
by
the
wall
itself
and
the
other
by
that
portion
of
the
prison
which
looked
or
rather
would
have
looked
but
for
the
wall
towards
paul
s
cathedral
sauntering
or
sitting
about
in
every
possible
attitude
of
listless
idleness
were
a
great
number
of
debtors
the
major
part
of
whom
were
waiting
in
prison
until
their
day
of
going
up
before
the
insolvent
court
should
arrive
while
others
had
been
remanded
for
various
terms
which
they
were
idling
away
as
they
best
could
some
were
shabby
some
were
smart
many
dirty
a
few
clean
but
there
they
all
lounged
and
loitered
and
slunk
about
with
as
little
spirit
or
purpose
as
the
beasts
in
a
menagerie
lolling
from
the
windows
which
commanded
a
view
of
this
promenade
were
a
number
of
persons
some
in
noisy
conversation
with
their
acquaintance
below
others
playing
at
ball
with
some
adventurous
throwers
outside
others
looking
on
at
the
or
watching
the
boys
as
they
cried
the
game
dirty
slipshod
women
passed
and
repassed
on
their
way
to
the
in
one
corner
of
the
yard
children
screamed
and
fought
and
played
together
in
another
the
tumbling
of
the
skittles
and
the
shouts
of
the
players
mingled
perpetually
with
these
and
a
hundred
other
sounds
and
all
was
noise
and
tumult
save
in
a
little
miserable
shed
a
few
yards
off
where
lay
all
quiet
and
ghastly
the
body
of
the
chancery
prisoner
who
had
died
the
night
before
awaiting
the
mockery
of
an
inquest
the
body
it
is
the
lawyer
s
term
for
the
restless
whirling
mass
of
cares
and
anxieties
affections
hopes
and
griefs
that
make
up
the
living
man
the
law
had
his
body
and
there
it
lay
clothed
in
an
awful
witness
to
its
tender
mercy
would
you
like
to
see
a
sir
inquired
job
trotter
what
do
you
mean
was
pickwick
s
counter
inquiry
a
vistlin
shop
sir
interposed
weller
what
is
that
sam
a
s
inquired
pickwick
bless
your
heart
no
sir
replied
job
a
sir
is
where
they
sell
job
trotter
briefly
explained
here
that
all
persons
being
prohibited
under
heavy
penalties
from
conveying
spirits
into
debtors
prisons
and
such
commodities
being
highly
prized
by
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
confined
therein
it
had
occurred
to
some
speculative
turnkey
to
connive
for
certain
lucrative
considerations
at
two
or
three
prisoners
retailing
the
favourite
article
of
gin
for
their
own
profit
and
advantage
this
plan
you
see
sir
has
been
gradually
introduced
into
all
the
prisons
for
debt
said
trotter
and
it
has
this
wery
great
advantage
said
sam
that
the
turnkeys
takes
wery
good
care
to
seize
hold
o
ev
rybody
but
them
as
pays
em
that
attempts
the
willainy
and
wen
it
gets
in
the
papers
they
re
applauded
for
their
wigilance
so
it
cuts
two
ways
frightens
other
people
from
the
trade
and
elewates
their
own
exactly
so
weller
observed
job
well
but
are
these
rooms
never
searched
to
ascertain
whether
any
spirits
are
concealed
in
them
said
pickwick
cert
nly
they
are
sir
replied
sam
but
the
turnkeys
knows
beforehand
and
gives
the
word
to
the
wistlers
and
you
may
wistle
for
it
wen
you
go
to
by
this
time
job
had
tapped
at
a
door
which
was
opened
by
a
gentleman
with
an
uncombed
head
who
bolted
it
after
them
when
they
had
walked
in
and
grinned
upon
which
job
grinned
and
sam
also
whereupon
pickwick
thinking
it
might
be
expected
of
him
kept
on
smiling
to
the
end
of
the
interview
the
gentleman
with
the
uncombed
head
appeared
quite
satisfied
with
this
mute
announcement
of
their
business
and
producing
a
flat
stone
bottle
which
might
hold
about
a
couple
of
quarts
from
beneath
his
bedstead
filled
out
three
glasses
of
gin
which
job
trotter
and
sam
disposed
of
in
a
most
workmanlike
manner
any
more
said
the
whistling
gentleman
no
more
replied
job
trotter
pickwick
paid
the
door
was
unbolted
and
out
they
came
the
uncombed
gentleman
bestowing
a
friendly
nod
upon
roker
who
happened
to
be
passing
at
the
moment
from
this
spot
pickwick
wandered
along
all
the
galleries
up
and
down
all
the
staircases
and
once
again
round
the
whole
area
of
the
yard
the
great
body
of
the
prison
population
appeared
to
be
mivins
and
smangle
and
the
parson
and
the
butcher
and
the
leg
over
and
over
and
over
again
there
were
the
same
squalor
the
same
turmoil
and
noise
the
same
general
characteristics
in
every
corner
in
the
best
and
the
worst
alike
the
whole
place
seemed
restless
and
troubled
and
the
people
were
crowding
and
flitting
to
and
fro
like
the
shadows
in
an
uneasy
dream
i
have
seen
enough
said
pickwick
as
he
threw
himself
into
a
chair
in
his
little
apartment
my
head
aches
with
these
scenes
and
my
heart
too
henceforth
i
will
be
a
prisoner
in
my
own
and
pickwick
steadfastly
adhered
to
this
determination
for
three
long
months
he
remained
shut
up
all
day
only
stealing
out
at
night
to
breathe
the
air
when
the
greater
part
of
his
were
in
bed
or
carousing
in
their
rooms
his
health
was
beginning
to
suffer
from
the
closeness
of
the
confinement
but
neither
the
entreaties
of
perker
and
his
friends
nor
the
still
more
repeated
warnings
and
admonitions
of
samuel
weller
could
induce
him
to
alter
one
jot
of
his
inflexible
resolution
chapter
xlvi
records
a
touching
act
of
delicate
feeling
not
unmixed
with
pleasantry
achieved
and
performed
by
dodson
and
fogg
it
was
within
a
week
of
the
close
of
the
month
of
july
that
a
hackney
cabriolet
number
unrecorded
was
seen
to
proceed
at
a
rapid
pace
up
goswell
street
three
people
were
squeezed
into
it
besides
the
driver
who
sat
in
his
own
particular
little
dickey
at
the
side
over
the
apron
were
hung
two
shawls
belonging
to
two
small
ladies
under
the
apron
between
whom
compressed
into
a
very
small
compass
was
stowed
away
a
gentleman
of
heavy
and
subdued
demeanour
who
whenever
he
ventured
to
make
an
observation
was
snapped
up
short
by
one
of
the
vixenish
ladies
lastly
the
two
vixenish
ladies
and
the
heavy
gentleman
were
giving
the
driver
contradictory
directions
all
tending
to
the
one
point
that
he
should
stop
at
bardell
s
door
which
the
heavy
gentleman
in
direct
opposition
to
and
defiance
of
the
vixenish
ladies
contended
was
a
green
door
and
not
a
yellow
one
stop
at
the
house
with
a
green
door
driver
said
the
heavy
gentleman
oh
you
perwerse
creetur
exclaimed
one
of
the
vixenish
ladies
drive
to
the
ouse
with
the
yellow
door
upon
this
the
cabman
who
in
a
sudden
effort
to
pull
up
at
the
house
with
the
green
door
had
pulled
the
horse
up
so
high
that
he
nearly
pulled
him
backward
into
the
cabriolet
let
the
animal
s
down
to
the
ground
again
and
paused
now
vere
am
i
to
pull
up
inquired
the
driver
settle
it
among
yourselves
all
i
ask
is
vere
here
the
contest
was
renewed
with
increased
violence
and
the
horse
being
troubled
with
a
fly
on
his
nose
the
cabman
humanely
employed
his
leisure
in
lashing
him
about
on
the
head
on
the
principle
most
wotes
carries
the
day
said
one
of
the
vixenish
ladies
at
length
the
ouse
with
the
yellow
door
but
after
the
cabriolet
had
dashed
up
in
splendid
style
to
the
house
with
the
yellow
door
making
as
one
of
the
vixenish
ladies
triumphantly
said
acterrally
more
noise
than
if
one
had
come
in
one
s
own
carriage
and
after
the
driver
had
dismounted
to
assist
the
ladies
in
getting
out
the
small
round
head
of
master
thomas
bardell
was
thrust
out
of
the
window
of
a
house
with
a
red
door
a
few
numbers
off
aggrawatin
thing
said
the
vixenish
lady
darting
a
withering
glance
at
the
heavy
gentleman
my
dear
it
s
not
my
fault
said
the
gentleman
don
t
talk
to
me
you
creetur

retorted
the
lady
the
house
with
the
red
door
cabmin
oh
if
ever
a
woman
was
troubled
with
a
ruffinly
creetur
that
takes
a
pride
and
a
pleasure
in
disgracing
his
wife
on
every
possible
occasion
afore
strangers
i
am
that
woman
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
raddle
said
the
other
little
woman
who
was
no
other
than
cluppins
what
have
i
been
of
asked
raddle
don

t
you
brute
for
fear

should
be
perwoked
to
forgit
my
sect
and
strike
you
said
raddle
while
this
dialogue
was
going
on
the
driver
was
most
ignominiously
leading
the
horse
by
the
bridle
up
to
the
house
with
the
red
door
which
master
bardell
had
already
opened
here
was
a
mean
and
low
way
of
arriving
at
a
friend
s
house
no
dashing
up
with
all
the
fire
and
fury
of
the
animal
no
jumping
down
of
the
driver
no
loud
knocking
at
the
door
no
opening
of
the
apron
with
a
crash
at
the
very
last
moment
for
fear
of
the
ladies
sitting
in
a
draught
and
then
the
man
handing
the
shawls
out
afterwards
as
if
he
were
a
private
coachman
the
whole
edge
of
the
thing
had
been
taken
off
it
was
flatter
than
walking
well
tommy
said
cluppins
how

master

said
cluppins
in
an
insinuating
manner
oh

replied
master
bardell
opening
his
eyes
very
wide
as
he
delivered
the
intelligence
what
the
lady
as
has
taken
the
lodgings
ejaculated
cluppins
master
bardell
put
his
hands
deeper
down
into
his
pockets
and
nodded
exactly
times
to
imply
that
it
was
the
and
no
other
bless

said
cluppins
it
s
quite
a
party
ah
if

knew
what

cupboard

replied
master

cluppins
coaxingly

replied
master
bardell
shaking
his
head
and
applying
himself
to
the
bottom
step
again
drat
the
child
muttered
cluppins
what
a
prowokin
little
wretch
it
is

said
i
wasn

to
rejoined
master
bardell
i
m
to
have
some
i
cheered
by
this
prospect
the
precocious
boy
applied
himself
to
his
infantile
treadmill
with
increased
vigour
the
above
examination
of
a
child
of
tender
years
took
place
while
and
raddle
and
the
were
having
an
altercation
concerning
the
fare
which
terminating
at
this
point
in
favour
of
the
cabman
raddle
came
up
tottering
lauk
mary
ann
what
s
the
matter
said
cluppins
it
s
put
me
all
over
in
such
a
tremble
betsy
replied
raddle
raddle
ain
t
like
a
man
he
leaves
everythink
to
this
was
scarcely
fair
upon
the
unfortunate
raddle
who
had
been
thrust
aside
by
his
good
lady
in
the
commencement
of
the
dispute
and
peremptorily
commanded
to
hold
his
tongue
he
had
no
opportunity
of
defending
himself
however
for
raddle
gave
unequivocal
signs
of
fainting
which
being
perceived
from
the
parlour
window
bardell
sanders
the
lodger
and
the
lodger
s
servant
darted
precipitately
out
and
conveyed
her
into
the
house
all
talking
at
the
same
time
and
giving
utterance
to
various
expressions
of
pity
and
condolence
as
if
she
were
one
of
the
most
suffering
mortals
on
earth
being
conveyed
into
the
front
parlour
she
was
there
deposited
on
a
sofa
and
the
lady
from
the
first
floor
running
up
to
the
first
floor
returned
with
a
bottle
of
which
holding
raddle
tight
round
the
neck
she
applied
in
all
womanly
kindness
and
pity
to
her
nose
until
that
lady
with
many
plunges
and
struggles
was
fain
to
declare
herself
decidedly
better
ah
poor
thing
said
rogers
i
know
what
her
feelin
s
is
too
ah
poor
thing
so
do
i
said
sanders
and
then
all
the
ladies
moaned
in
unison
and
said
they
knew
what
it
was
and
they
pitied
her
from
their
hearts
they
did
even
the
lodger
s
little
servant
who
was
thirteen
years
old
and
three
feet
high
murmured
her
sympathy
but
what
s
been
the
matter
said
bardell
ah
what
has
decomposed
you
ma
am
inquired
rogers
i
have
been
a
good
deal
flurried
replied
raddle
in
a
reproachful
manner
thereupon
the
ladies
cast
indignant
glances
at
raddle
why
the
fact
is
said
that
unhappy
gentleman
stepping
forward
when
we
alighted
at
this
door
a
dispute
arose
with
the
driver
of
the
cabrioily
a
loud
scream
from
his
wife
at
the
mention
of
this
word
rendered
all
further
explanation
inaudible
you
d
better
leave
us
to
bring
her
round
raddle
said
cluppins
she
ll
never
get
better
as
long
as
you
re
all
the
ladies
concurred
in
this
opinion
so
raddle
was
pushed
out
of
the
room
and
requested
to
give
himself
an
airing
in
the
back
yard
which
he
did
for
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
when
bardell
announced
to
him
with
a
solemn
face
that
he
might
come
in
now
but
that
he
must
be
very
careful
how
he
behaved
towards
his
wife
she
knew
he
didn
t
mean
to
be
unkind
but
mary
ann
was
very
far
from
strong
and
if
he
didn
t
take
care
he
might
lose
her
when
he
least
expected
it
which
would
be
a
very
dreadful
reflection
for
him
afterwards
and
so
on
all
this
raddle
heard
with
great
submission
and
presently
returned
to
the
parlour
in
a
most
manner
why
rogers
ma
am
said
bardell
you
ve
never
been
introduced
i
declare
raddle
ma
am
cluppins
ma
am
raddle
ma
which
is
cluppins
s
sister
suggested
sanders
oh
indeed
said
rogers
graciously
for
she
was
the
lodger
and
her
servant
was
in
waiting
so
she
was
more
gracious
than
intimate
in
right
of
her
position
oh
indeed
raddle
smiled
sweetly
raddle
bowed
and
cluppins
said
she
was
sure
she
was
very
happy
to
have
an
opportunity
of
being
known
to
a
lady
which
she
had
heerd
so
much
in
favour
of
as
a
compliment
which
the
lady
acknowledged
with
graceful
condescension
well
raddle
said
bardell
i
m
sure
you
ought
to
feel
very
much
honoured
at
you
and
tommy
being
the
only
gentlemen
to
escort
so
many
ladies
all
the
way
to
the
spaniards
at
hampstead
don
t
you
think
he
ought
rogers
ma
am
oh
certainly
ma
am
replied
rogers
after
whom
all
the
other
ladies
responded
oh
of
course
i
feel
it
ma
am
said
raddle
rubbing
his
hands
and
evincing
a
slight
tendency
to
brighten
up
a
little
indeed
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
said
as
we
was
along
in
the
cabrioily
at
the
recapitulation
of
the
word
which
awakened
so
many
painful
recollections
raddle
applied
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
again
and
uttered
a
scream
so
that
bardell
frowned
upon
raddle
to
intimate
that
he
had
better
not
say
anything
more
and
desired
rogers
s
servant
with
an
air
to
put
the
wine
this
was
the
signal
for
displaying
the
hidden
treasures
of
the
closet
which
comprised
sundry
plates
of
oranges
and
biscuits
and
a
bottle
of
old
crusted
port
that
at
with
another
of
the
celebrated
east
india
sherry
at
which
were
all
produced
in
honour
of
the
lodger
and
afforded
unlimited
satisfaction
to
everybody
after
great
consternation
had
been
excited
in
the
mind
of
cluppins
by
an
attempt
on
the
part
of
tommy
to
recount
how
he
had
been
regarding
the
cupboard
then
in
action
which
was
fortunately
nipped
in
the
bud
by
his
imbibing
half
a
glass
of
the
old
crusted
the
wrong
way
and
thereby
endangering
his
life
for
some
seconds
the
party
walked
forth
in
quest
of
a
hampstead
stage
this
was
soon
found
and
in
a
couple
of
hours
they
all
arrived
safely
in
the
spaniards
where
the
luckless
raddle
s
very
first
act
nearly
occasioned
his
good
lady
a
relapse
it
being
neither
more
nor
less
than
to
order
tea
for
seven
whereas
as
the
ladies
one
and
all
remarked
what
could
have
been
easier
than
for
tommy
to
have
drank
out
of
anybody
s
cup
or
everybody
s
if
that
was
all
when
the
waiter
wasn
t
looking
which
would
have
saved
one
head
of
tea
and
the
tea
just
as
good
however
there
was
no
help
for
it
and
the
came
with
seven
cups
and
saucers
and
on
the
same
scale
bardell
was
unanimously
voted
into
the
chair
and
rogers
being
stationed
on
her
right
hand
and
raddle
on
her
left
the
meal
proceeded
with
great
merriment
and
success
how
sweet
the
country
is
to
be
sure
sighed
rogers
i
almost
wish
i
lived
in
it
oh
you
wouldn
t
like
that
ma
am
replied
bardell
rather
hastily
for
it
was
not
at
all
advisable
with
reference
to
the
lodgings
to
encourage
such
notions
you
wouldn
t
like
it
ma
oh
i
should
think
you
was
a
deal
too
lively
and
sought
after
to
be
content
with
the
country
ma
am
said
little
cluppins
perhaps
i
am
ma
am
perhaps
i
am
sighed
the
lodger
for
lone
people
as
have
got
nobody
to
care
for
them
or
take
care
of
them
or
as
have
been
hurt
in
their
mind
or
that
kind
of
thing
observed
raddle
plucking
up
a
little
cheerfulness
and
looking
round
the
country
is
all
very
well
the
country
for
a
wounded
spirit
they
now
of
all
things
in
the
world
that
the
unfortunate
man
could
have
said
any
would
have
been
preferable
to
this
of
course
bardell
burst
into
tears
and
requested
to
be
led
from
the
table
instantly
upon
which
the
affectionate
child
began
to
cry
too
most
dismally
would
anybody
believe
ma
am
exclaimed
raddle
turning
fiercely
to
the
lodger
that
a
woman
could
be
married
to
such
a
unmanly
creetur
which
can
tamper
with
a
woman
s
feelings
as
he
does
every
hour
in
the
day
ma
am
my
dear
remonstrated
raddle
i
didn
t
mean
anything
my
you
didn
t
mean
repeated
raddle
with
great
scorn
and
contempt
go
away
i
can
t
bear
the
sight
on
you
you
you
must
not
flurry
yourself
mary
ann
interposed
cluppins
you
really
must
consider
yourself
my
dear
which
you
never
do
now
go
away
raddle
there
s
a
good
soul
or
you
ll
only
aggravate
you
had
better
take
your
tea
by
yourself
sir
indeed
said
rogers
again
applying
the
sanders
who
according
to
custom
was
very
busy
with
the
expressed
the
same
opinion
and
raddle
quietly
retired
after
this
there
was
a
great
hoisting
up
of
master
bardell
who
was
rather
a
large
size
for
hugging
into
his
mother
s
arms
in
which
operation
he
got
his
boots
in
the
and
occasioned
some
confusion
among
the
cups
and
saucers
but
that
description
of
fainting
fits
which
is
contagious
among
ladies
seldom
lasts
long
so
when
he
had
been
well
kissed
and
a
little
cried
over
bardell
recovered
set
him
down
again
wondering
how
she
could
have
been
so
foolish
and
poured
out
some
more
tea
it
was
at
this
moment
that
the
sound
of
approaching
wheels
was
heard
and
that
the
ladies
looking
up
saw
a
stop
at
the
garden
gate
more
company
said
sanders
it
s
a
gentleman
said
raddle
well
if
it
ain
t
jackson
the
young
man
from
dodson
and
fogg
s
cried
bardell
why
gracious
surely
pickwick
can
t
have
paid
the
or
hoffered
marriage
said
cluppins
dear
me
how
slow
the
gentleman
is
exclaimed
rogers
why
doesn
t
he
make
haste
as
the
lady
spoke
these
words
jackson
turned
from
the
coach
where
he
had
been
addressing
some
observations
to
a
shabby
man
in
black
leggings
who
had
just
emerged
from
the
vehicle
with
a
thick
ash
stick
in
his
hand
and
made
his
way
to
the
place
where
the
ladies
were
seated
winding
his
hair
round
the
brim
of
his
hat
as
he
came
along
is
anything
the
matter
has
anything
taken
place
jackson
said
bardell
eagerly
nothing
whatever
ma
am
replied
jackson
how
de
do
ladies
i
have
to
ask
pardon
ladies
for
intruding
but
the
law
ladies
the
with
this
apology
jackson
smiled
made
a
comprehensive
bow
and
gave
his
hair
another
wind
rogers
whispered
raddle
that
he
was
really
an
elegant
young
man
i
called
in
goswell
street
resumed
jackson
and
hearing
that
you
were
here
from
the
slavey
took
a
coach
and
came
on
our
people
want
you
down
in
the
city
directly
lor
ejaculated
that
lady
starting
at
the
sudden
nature
of
the
communication
yes
said
jackson
biting
his
lip
it
s
very
important
and
pressing
business
which
can
t
be
postponed
on
any
account
indeed
dodson
expressly
said
so
to
me
and
so
did
fogg
i
ve
kept
the
coach
on
purpose
for
you
to
go
back
how
very
strange
exclaimed
bardell
the
ladies
agreed
that
it
very
strange
but
were
unanimously
of
opinion
that
it
must
be
very
important
or
dodson
fogg
would
never
have
sent
and
further
that
the
business
being
urgent
she
ought
to
repair
to
dodson
fogg
s
without
any
delay
there
was
a
certain
degree
of
pride
and
importance
about
being
wanted
by
one
s
lawyers
in
such
a
monstrous
hurry
that
was
by
no
means
displeasing
to
bardell
especially
as
it
might
be
reasonably
supposed
to
enhance
her
consequence
in
the
eyes
of
the
lodger
she
simpered
a
little
affected
extreme
vexation
and
hesitation
and
at
last
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
she
supposed
she
must
go
but
won
t
you
refresh
yourself
after
your
walk
jackson
said
bardell
persuasively
why
really
there
ain
t
much
time
to
lose
replied
jackson
and
i
ve
got
a
friend
here
he
continued
looking
towards
the
man
with
the
ash
stick
oh
ask
your
friend
to
come
here
sir
said
bardell
pray
ask
your
friend
here
why
thank
ee
i
d
rather
not
said
jackson
with
some
embarrassment
of
manner
he
s
not
much
used
to
ladies
society
and
it
makes
him
bashful
if
you
ll
order
the
waiter
to
deliver
him
anything
short
he
won
t
drink
it
off
at
once
won
t
he
only
try
him
jackson
s
fingers
wandered
playfully
round
his
nose
at
this
portion
of
his
discourse
to
warn
his
hearers
that
he
was
speaking
ironically
the
waiter
was
at
once
despatched
to
the
bashful
gentleman
and
the
bashful
gentleman
took
something
jackson
also
took
something
and
the
ladies
took
something
for
hospitality
s
sake
jackson
then
said
he
was
afraid
it
was
time
to
go
upon
which
sanders
cluppins
and
tommy
who
it
was
arranged
should
accompany
bardell
leaving
the
others
to
raddle
s
protection
got
into
the
coach
isaac
said
jackson
as
bardell
prepared
to
get
in
looking
up
at
the
man
with
the
ash
stick
who
was
seated
on
the
box
smoking
a
cigar
well
this
is
oh
i
know
d
that
long
ago
said
the
man
bardell
got
in
jackson
got
in
after
her
and
away
they
drove
bardell
could
not
help
ruminating
on
what
jackson
s
friend
had
said
shrewd
creatures
those
lawyers
lord
bless
us
how
they
find
people
out
sad
thing
about
these
costs
of
our
people
s
ain
t
it
said
jackson
when
cluppins
and
sanders
had
fallen
asleep
your
bill
of
costs
i
i
m
very
sorry
they
can
t
get
them
replied
bardell
but
if
you
law
gentlemen
do
these
things
on
speculation
why
you
must
get
a
loss
now
and
then
you
you
gave
them
a
the
amount
of
your
costs
after
the
trial
i
m
told
said
jackson
yes
just
as
a
matter
of
form
replied
bardell
certainly
replied
jackson
drily
quite
a
matter
of
form
on
they
drove
and
bardell
fell
asleep
she
was
awakened
after
some
time
by
the
stopping
of
the
coach
bless
us
said
the
lady
are
we
at
freeman
s
court
we
re
not
going
quite
so
far
replied
jackson
have
the
goodness
to
step
bardell
not
yet
thoroughly
awake
complied
it
was
a
curious
place
a
large
wall
with
a
gate
in
the
middle
and
a
burning
inside
now
ladies
cried
the
man
with
the
ash
stick
looking
into
the
coach
and
shaking
sanders
to
wake
her
come
rousing
her
friend
sanders
alighted
bardell
leaning
on
jackson
s
arm
and
leading
tommy
by
the
hand
had
already
entered
the
porch
they
followed
the
room
they
turned
into
was
even
more
than
the
porch
such
a
number
of
men
standing
about
and
they
stared
so
what
place
is
this
inquired
bardell
pausing
only
one
of
our
public
offices
replied
jackson
hurrying
her
through
a
door
and
looking
round
to
see
that
the
other
women
were
following
look
sharp
isaac
safe
and
sound
replied
the
man
with
the
ash
stick
the
door
swung
heavily
after
them
and
they
descended
a
small
flight
of
steps
here
we
are
at
last
all
right
and
tight
bardell
said
jackson
looking
exultingly
round
what
do
you
mean
said
bardell
with
a
palpitating
heart
just
this
replied
jackson
drawing
her
a
little
on
one
side
don
t
be
frightened
bardell
there
never
was
a
more
delicate
man
than
dodson
ma
am
or
a
more
humane
man
than
fogg
it
was
their
duty
in
the
way
of
business
to
take
you
in
execution
for
them
costs
but
they
were
anxious
to
spare
your
feelings
as
much
as
they
could
what
a
comfort
it
must
be
to
you
to
think
how
it
s
been
done
this
is
the
fleet
ma
am
wish
you
bardell
tommy
as
jackson
hurried
away
in
company
with
the
man
with
the
ash
stick
another
man
with
a
key
in
his
hand
who
had
been
looking
on
led
the
bewildered
female
to
a
second
short
flight
of
steps
leading
to
a
doorway
bardell
screamed
violently
tommy
roared
cluppins
shrunk
within
herself
and
sanders
made
off
without
more
ado
for
there
stood
the
injured
pickwick
taking
his
nightly
allowance
of
air
and
beside
him
leant
samuel
weller
who
seeing
bardell
took
his
hat
off
with
mock
reverence
while
his
master
turned
indignantly
on
his
heel
don
t
bother
the
woman
said
the
turnkey
to
weller
she
s
just
come
a
prisoner
said
sam
quickly
replacing
his

there
was
no
reply
to
these
inquiries
for

started
furiously
off
the
instant
he
received
his
commission
and
bardell
had
fainted
in
real
downright
earnest
chapter

chiefly
devoted
to

the

pickwick
s
benevolence
proves
stronger
than
his
obstinacy
job
trotter
abating
nothing
of
his
speed
ran
up
holborn
sometimes
in
the
middle
of
the
road
sometimes
on
the
pavement
sometimes
in
the
gutter
as
the
chances
of
getting
along
varied
with
the
press
of
men
women
children
and
coaches
in
each
division
of
the
thoroughfare
and
regardless
of
all
obstacles
stopped
not
for
an
instant
until
he
reached
the
gate
of
gray
s
inn
notwithstanding
all
the
expedition
he
had
used
however
the
gate
had
been
closed
a
good
when
he
reached
it
and
by
the
time
he
had
discovered
perker
s
laundress
who
lived
with
a
married
daughter
who
had
bestowed
her
hand
upon
a
waiter
who
occupied
the
of
some
number
in
some
street
closely
adjoining
to
some
brewery
somewhere
behind
gray
s
inn
lane
it
was
within
fifteen
minutes
of
closing
the
prison
for
the
night
lowten
had
still
to
be
ferreted
out
from
the
back
parlour
of
the
magpie
and
stump
and
job
had
scarcely
accomplished
this
object
and
communicated
sam
weller
s
message
when
the
clock
struck
ten
there
said
lowten
it

too
late

it
be
better
to
see
perker
so
that
we
may
be
there
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
why
responded
lowten
after
a
little
consideration
if
it
was
in
anybody
else
s
case
perker
wouldn
t
be
best
pleased
at
my
going
up
to
his
house
but
as
it
s
pickwick
s
i
think
i
may
venture
to
take
a
cab
and
charge
it
to
the
deciding
on
this
line
of
conduct
lowten
took
up
his
hat
and
begging
the
assembled
company
to
appoint
a
during
his
temporary
absence
led
the
way
to
the
nearest
summoning
the
cab
of
most
promising
appearance
he
directed
the
driver
to
repair
to

russell
square
perker
had
had
a
that
day
as
was
testified
by
the
appearance
of
lights
in
the
windows
the
sound
of
an
improved
grand
piano
and
an
improvable
cabinet
voice
issuing
therefrom
and
a
rather
overpowering
smell
of
meat
which
pervaded
the
steps
and
entry
in
fact
a
couple
of
very
good
country
agencies
happening
to
come
up
to
town
at
the
same
time
an
agreeable
little
party
had
been
got
together
to
meet
them
comprising

secretary
prosee
the
eminent

his
pupil
who
had
written
a
lively
book
about
the
law
of
demises
with
a
vast
quantity
of
marginal
notes
and
references
and
several
other
eminent
and
distinguished
personages
from
this
society
little
perker
detached
himself
on
his
clerk
being
announced
in
a
whisper
and
repairing
to
the
there
found
lowten
and
job
trotter
looking
very
dim
and
shadowy
by
the
light
of
a
kitchen
candle
which
the
gentleman
who
condescended
to
appear
in
plush
shorts
and
cottons
for
a
quarterly
stipend
had
with
a
becoming
contempt
for
the
clerk
and
all
things
appertaining
to
the
office
placed
upon
the
table
now
lowten
said
little
perker
shutting
the
door

said
perker
taking
both
hands
out
of
his
pockets
and
striking
the
knuckles
of
his
right
against
the
palm
of
his
left
emphatically
those
are
the
cleverest
scamps
i
ever
had
anything
to
do
with
the
sharpest
practitioners
i
ever
knew
sir
observed
lowten
sharp
echoed
perker
there
s
no
knowing
where
to
have
very
true
sir
there
is
not
replied
lowten
and
then
both
master
and
man
pondered
for
a
few
seconds
with
animated
countenances
as
if
they
were
reflecting
upon
one
of
the
most
beautiful
and
ingenious
discoveries
that
the
intellect
of
man
had
ever
made
when
they
had
in
some
measure
recovered
from
their
trance
of
admiration
job
trotter
discharged
himself
of
the
rest
of
his
commission
perker
nodded
his
head
thoughtfully
and
pulled
out
his
watch
at
ten
precisely
i
will
be
there
said
the
little
man
sam
is
quite
right
tell
him
so
will
you
take
a
glass
of
wine
lowten
no
thank
you
you
mean
yes
i
think
said
the
little
man
turning
to
the
sideboard
for
a
decanter
and
glasses
as
lowten
yes
he
said
no
more
on
the
subject
but
inquired
of
job
in
an
audible
whisper
whether
the
portrait
of
perker
which
hung
opposite
the
fireplace
wasn
t
a
wonderful
likeness
to
which
job
of
course
replied
that
it
was
the
wine
being
by
this
time
poured
out
lowten
drank
to
perker
and
the
children
and
job
to
perker
the
gentleman
in
the
plush
shorts
and
cottons
considering
it
no
part
of
his
duty
to
show
the
people
from
the
office
out
consistently
declined
to
answer
the
bell
and
they
showed
themselves
out
the
attorney
betook
himself
to
his
the
clerk
to
the
magpie
and
stump
and
job
to
covent
garden
market
to
spend
the
night
in
a
vegetable
basket
punctually
at
the
appointed
hour
next
morning
the
little
attorney
tapped
at
pickwick
s
door
which
was
opened
with
great
alacrity
by
sam
weller
mr
perker
sir
said
sam
announcing
the
visitor
to
pickwick
who
was
sitting
at
the
window
in
a
thoughtful
attitude
wery
glad
you
ve
looked
in
accidentally
sir
i
rather
think
the
gov
nor
wants
to
have
a
word
and
a
half
with
you
perker
bestowed
a
look
of
intelligence
on
sam
intimating
that
he
understood
he
was
not
to
say
he
had
been
sent
for
and
beckoning
him
to
approach
whispered
briefly
in
his
ear
you
don
t
mean
that
ere
sir
said
sam
starting
back
in
excessive
surprise
perker
nodded
and
smiled
samuel
weller
looked
at
the
little
lawyer
then
at
pickwick
then
at
the
ceiling
then
at
perker
again
grinned
laughed
outright
and
finally
catching
up
his
hat
from
the
carpet
without
further
explanation
disappeared
what
does
this
mean
inquired
pickwick
looking
at
perker
with
astonishment
what
has
put
sam
into
this
extraordinary
state
oh
nothing
nothing
replied
perker
come
my
dear
sir
draw
up
your
chair
to
the
table
i
have
a
good
deal
to
say
to
what
papers
are
those
inquired
pickwick
as
the
little
man
deposited
on
the
table
a
small
bundle
of
documents
tied
with
red
tape
the
papers
in
bardell
and
pickwick
replied
perker
undoing
the
knot
with
his
teeth
pickwick
grated
the
legs
of
his
chair
against
the
ground
and
throwing
himself
into
it
folded
his
hands
and
looked
sternly
if
pickwick
ever
could
look
sternly
at
his
legal
friend
you
don
t
like
to
hear
the
name
of
the
cause
said
the
little
man
still
busying
himself
with
the
knot
no
i
do
not
indeed
replied
pickwick
sorry
for
that
resumed
perker
because
it
will
form
the
subject
of
our
i
would
rather
that
the
subject
should
be
never
mentioned
between
us
perker
interposed
pickwick
hastily
pooh
pooh
my
dear
sir
said
the
little
man
untying
the
bundle
and
glancing
eagerly
at
pickwick
out
of
the
corners
of
his
eyes
it
must
be
mentioned
i
have
come
here
on
purpose
now
are
you
ready
to
hear
what
i
have
to
say
my
dear
sir
no
hurry
if
you
are
not
i
can
wait
i
have
this
morning
s
paper
here
your
time
shall
be
mine
there
hereupon
the
little
man
threw
one
leg
over
the
other
and
made
a
show
of
beginning
to
read
with
great
composure
and
application
well
well
said
pickwick
with
a
sigh
but
softening
into
a
smile
at
the
same
time
say
what
you
have
to
say
it
s
the
old
story
i
suppose
with
a
difference
my
dear
sir
with
a
difference
rejoined
perker
deliberately
folding
up
the
paper
and
putting
it
into
his
pocket
again
mrs
bardell
the
plaintiff
in
the
action
is
within
these
walls
i
know
it
was
pickwick
s
reply
very
good
retorted
perker
and
you
know
how
she
comes
here
i
suppose
i
mean
on
what
grounds
and
at
whose
suit
yes
at
least
i
have
heard
sam
s
account
of
the
matter
said
pickwick
with
affected
carelessness
sam
s
account
of
the
matter
replied
perker
is
i
will
venture
to
say
a
perfectly
correct
one
well
now
my
dear
sir
the
first
question
i
have
to
ask
is
whether
this
woman
is
to
remain
here
to
remain
here
echoed
pickwick
to
remain
here
my
dear
sir
rejoined
perker
leaning
back
in
his
chair
and
looking
steadily
at
his
client
how
can
you
ask
me
said
that
gentleman
it
rests
with
dodson
and
fogg
you
know
that
very
i
know
nothing
of
the
kind
retorted
perker
firmly
it
does
with
dodson
and
fogg
you
know
the
men
my
dear
sir
as
well
as
i
do
it
rests
solely
wholly
and
entirely
with
with
me
ejaculated
pickwick
rising
nervously
from
his
chair
and
reseating
himself
directly
afterwards
the
little
man
gave
a
on
the
lid
of
his
opened
it
took
a
great
pinch
shut
it
up
again
and
repeated
the
words
with
i
say
my
dear
sir
resumed
the
little
man
who
seemed
to
gather
confidence
from
the
snuff
i
say
that
her
speedy
liberation
or
perpetual
imprisonment
rests
with
you
and
with
you
alone
hear
me
out
my
dear
sir
if
you
please
and
do
not
be
so
very
energetic
for
it
will
only
put
you
into
a
perspiration
and
do
no
good
whatever
i
say
continued
perker
checking
off
each
position
on
a
different
finger
as
he
laid
it
down
i
say
that
nobody
but
you
can
rescue
her
from
this
den
of
wretchedness
and
that
you
can
only
do
that
by
paying
the
costs
of
this
suit
both
of
plaintive
and
defendant
into
the
hands
of
these
freeman
court
sharks
now
pray
be
quiet
my
dear
pickwick
whose
face
had
been
undergoing
most
surprising
changes
during
this
speech
and
was
evidently
on
the
verge
of
a
strong
burst
of
indignation
calmed
his
wrath
as
well
as
he
could
perker
strengthening
his
argumentative
powers
with
another
pinch
of
snuff
proceeded
i
have
seen
the
woman
this
morning
by
paying
the
costs
you
can
obtain
a
full
release
and
discharge
from
the
damages
and
further
this
i
know
is
a
far
greater
object
of
consideration
with
you
my
dear
sir
a
voluntary
statement
under
her
hand
in
the
form
of
a
letter
to
me
that
this
business
was
from
the
very
first
fomented
and
encouraged
and
brought
about
by
these
men
dodson
and
fogg
that
she
deeply
regrets
ever
having
been
the
instrument
of
annoyance
or
injury
to
you
and
that
she
entreats
me
to
intercede
with
you
and
implore
your
if
i
pay
her
costs
for
her
said
pickwick
indignantly
a
valuable
document
indeed
no
if
in
the
case
my
dear
sir
said
perker
triumphantly
there
is
the
very
letter
i
speak
of
brought
to
my
office
by
another
woman
at
nine
o
clock
this
morning
before
i
had
set
foot
in
this
place
or
held
any
communication
with
bardell
upon
my
selecting
the
letter
from
the
bundle
the
little
lawyer
laid
it
at
pickwick
s
elbow
and
took
snuff
for
two
consecutive
minutes
without
winking
is
this
all
you
have
to
say
to
me
inquired
pickwick
mildly
not
quite
replied
perker
i
can
not
undertake
to
say
at
this
moment
whether
the
wording
of
the
cognovit
the
nature
of
the
ostensible
consideration
and
the
proof
we
can
get
together
about
the
whole
conduct
of
the
suit
will
be
sufficient
to
justify
an
indictment
for
conspiracy
i
fear
not
my
dear
sir
they
are
too
clever
for
that
i
doubt
i
do
mean
to
say
however
that
the
whole
facts
taken
together
will
be
sufficient
to
justify
you
in
the
minds
of
all
reasonable
men
and
now
my
dear
sir
i
put
it
to
you
this
one
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
or
whatever
it
may
be
take
it
in
round
numbers
is
nothing
to
you
a
jury
had
decided
against
you
well
their
verdict
is
wrong
but
still
they
decided
as
they
thought
right
and
it
against
you
you
have
now
an
opportunity
on
easy
terms
of
placing
yourself
in
a
much
higher
position
than
you
ever
could
by
remaining
here
which
would
only
be
imputed
by
people
who
didn
t
know
you
to
sheer
dogged
wrongheaded
brutal
obstinacy
nothing
else
my
dear
sir
believe
me
can
you
hesitate
to
avail
yourself
of
it
when
it
restores
you
to
your
friends
your
old
pursuits
your
health
and
amusements
when
it
liberates
your
faithful
and
attached
servant
whom
you
otherwise
doom
to
imprisonment
for
the
whole
of
your
life
and
above
all
when
it
enables
you
to
take
the
very
magnanimous
revenge
which
i
know
my
dear
sir
is
one
after
your
own
heart
of
releasing
this
woman
from
a
scene
of
misery
and
debauchery
to
which
no
man
should
ever
be
consigned
if
i
had
my
will
but
the
infliction
of
which
on
any
woman
is
even
more
frightful
and
barbarous
now
i
ask
you
my
dear
sir
not
only
as
your
legal
adviser
but
as
your
very
true
friend
will
you
let
slip
the
occasion
of
attaining
all
these
objects
and
doing
all
this
good
for
the
paltry
consideration
of
a
few
pounds
finding
their
way
into
the
pockets
of
a
couple
of
rascals
to
whom
it
makes
no
manner
of
difference
except
that
the
more
they
gain
the
more
they
ll
seek
and
so
the
sooner
be
led
into
some
piece
of
knavery
that
must
end
in
a
crash
i
have
put
these
considerations
to
you
my
dear
sir
very
feebly
and
imperfectly
but
i
ask
you
to
think
of
them
turn
them
over
in
your
mind
as
long
as
you
please
i
wait
here
most
patiently
for
your
before
pickwick
could
reply
before
perker
had
taken
one
twentieth
part
of
the
snuff
with
which
so
unusually
long
an
address
imperatively
required
to
be
followed
up
there
was
a
low
murmuring
of
voices
outside
and
then
a
hesitating
knock
at
the
door
dear
dear
exclaimed
pickwick
who
had
been
evidently
roused
by
his
friend
s
appeal
what
an
annoyance
that
door
is
who
is
that
me
sir
replied
sam
weller
putting
in
his
head
i
can
t
speak
to
you
just
now
sam
said
pickwick
i
am
engaged
at
this
moment
beg
your
pardon
sir
rejoined
weller
but
here
s
a
lady
here
sir
as
says
she
s
somethin
wery
partickler
to
i
can
t
see
any
lady
replied
pickwick
whose
mind
was
filled
with
visions
of
bardell
i
wouldn
t
make
too
sure
o
that
sir
urged
weller
shaking
his
head
if
you
know
d
who
was
near
sir
i
rayther
think
you
d
change
your
note
as
the
hawk
remarked
to
himself
vith
a
cheerful
laugh
ven
he
heerd
the
round
the
who
is
it
inquired
pickwick
will
you
see
her
sir
asked
weller
holding
the
door
in
his
hand
as
if
he
had
some
curious
live
animal
on
the
other
side
i
suppose
i
must
said
pickwick
looking
at
perker
well
then
all
in
to
begin
cried
sam
sound
the
gong
draw
up
the
curtain
and
enter
the
two
as
sam
weller
spoke
he
threw
the
door
open
and
there
rushed
tumultuously
into
the
room
nathaniel
winkle
leading
after
him
by
the
hand
the
identical
young
lady
who
at
dingley
dell
had
worn
the
boots
with
the
fur
round
the
tops
and
who
now
a
very
pleasing
compound
of
blushes
and
confusion
and
lilac
silk
and
a
smart
bonnet
and
a
rich
lace
veil
looked
prettier
than
ever
miss
arabella
allen
exclaimed
pickwick
rising
from
his
chair
no
replied
winkle
dropping
on
his
knees
mrs
winkle
pardon
my
dear
friend
pardon
pickwick
could
scarcely
believe
the
evidence
of
his
senses
and
perhaps
would
not
have
done
so
but
for
the
corroborative
testimony
afforded
by
the
smiling
countenance
of
perker
and
the
bodily
presence
in
the
background
of
sam
and
the
pretty
housemaid
who
appeared
to
contemplate
the
proceedings
with
the
liveliest
satisfaction
oh
pickwick
said
arabella
in
a
low
voice
as
if
alarmed
at
the
silence
can
you
forgive
my
imprudence
pickwick
returned
no
verbal
response
to
this
appeal
but
he
took
off
his
spectacles
in
great
haste
and
seizing
both
the
young
lady
s
hands
in
his
kissed
her
a
great
number
of
times
perhaps
a
greater
number
than
was
absolutely
necessary
and
then
still
retaining
one
of
her
hands
told
winkle
he
was
an
audacious
young
dog
and
bade
him
get
up
this
winkle
who
had
been
for
some
seconds
scratching
his
nose
with
the
brim
of
his
hat
in
a
penitent
manner
did
whereupon
pickwick
slapped
him
on
the
back
several
times
and
then
shook
hands
heartily
with
perker
who
not
to
be
in
the
compliments
of
the
occasion
saluted
both
the
bride
and
the
pretty
housemaid
with
right
and
having
wrung
winkle
s
hand
most
cordially
wound
up
his
demonstrations
of
joy
by
taking
snuff
enough
to
set
any
men
with
noses
for
life
why
my
dear
girl
said
pickwick
how
has
all
this
come
about
come
sit
down
and
let
me
hear
it
all
how
well
she
looks
doesn
t
she
perker
added
pickwick
surveying
arabella
s
face
with
a
look
of
as
much
pride
and
exultation
as
if
she
had
been
his
daughter
delightful
my
dear
sir
replied
the
little
man
if
i
were
not
a
married
man
myself
i
should
be
disposed
to
envy
you
you
thus
expressing
himself
the
little
lawyer
gave
winkle
a
poke
in
the
chest
which
that
gentleman
reciprocated
after
which
they
both
laughed
very
loudly
but
not
so
loudly
as
samuel
weller
who
had
just
relieved
his
feelings
by
kissing
the
pretty
housemaid
under
cover
of
the
cupboard
door
i
can
never
be
grateful
enough
to
you
sam
i
am
sure
said
arabella
with
the
sweetest
smile
imaginable
i
shall
not
forget
your
exertions
in
the
garden
at
don
t
say
nothin
wotever
about
it
ma
am
replied
sam
i
only
assisted
natur
ma
am
as
the
doctor
said
to
the
boy
s
mother
after
he
d
bled
him
to
mary
my
dear
sit
down
said
pickwick
cutting
short
these
compliments
now
then
how
long
have
you
been
married
eh
arabella
looked
bashfully
at
her
lord
and
master
who
replied
only
three
only
three
days
eh
said
pickwick
why
what
have
you
been
doing
these
three
months
ah
to
be
sure
interposed
perker
come
account
for
this
idleness
you
see
pickwick
s
only
astonishment
is
that
it
wasn
t
all
over
months
why
the
fact
is
replied
winkle
looking
at
his
blushing
young
wife
that
i
could
not
persuade
bella
to
run
away
for
a
long
time
and
when
i
had
persuaded
her
it
was
a
long
time
more
before
we
could
find
an
opportunity
mary
had
to
give
a
month
s
warning
too
before
she
could
leave
her
place
next
door
and
we
couldn
t
possibly
have
done
it
without
her
upon
my
word
exclaimed
pickwick
who
by
this
time
had
resumed
his
spectacles
and
was
looking
from
arabella
to
winkle
and
from
winkle
to
arabella
with
as
much
delight
depicted
in
his
countenance
as
warmheartedness
and
kindly
feeling
can
communicate
to
the
human
face
upon
my
word
you
seem
to
have
been
very
systematic
in
your
proceedings
and
is
your
brother
acquainted
with
all
this
my
dear
oh
no
no
replied
arabella
changing
colour
dear
pickwick
he
must
only
know
it
from
you
from
your
lips
alone
he
is
so
violent
so
prejudiced
and
has
been
so
so
anxious
in
behalf
of
his
friend
sawyer
added
arabella
looking
down
that
i
fear
the
consequences
ah
to
be
sure
said
perker
gravely
you
must
take
this
matter
in
hand
for
them
my
dear
sir
these
young
men
will
respect
you
when
they
would
listen
to
nobody
else
you
must
prevent
mischief
my
dear
sir
hot
blood
hot
and
the
little
man
took
a
warning
pinch
and
shook
his
head
doubtfully
you
forget
my
love
said
pickwick
gently
you
forget
that
i
am
a
no
indeed
i
do
not
my
dear
sir
replied
arabella
i
never
have
forgotten
it
i
have
never
ceased
to
think
how
great
your
sufferings
must
have
been
in
this
shocking
place
but
i
hoped
that
what
no
consideration
for
yourself
would
induce
you
to
do
a
regard
to
our
happiness
might
if
my
brother
hears
of
this
first
from
you
i
feel
certain
we
shall
be
reconciled
he
is
my
only
relation
in
the
world
pickwick
and
unless
you
plead
for
me
i
fear
i
have
lost
even
him
i
have
done
wrong
very
very
wrong
i
here
poor
arabella
hid
her
face
in
her
handkerchief
and
wept
bitterly
pickwick
s
nature
was
a
good
deal
worked
upon
by
these
same
tears
but
when
winkle
drying
her
eyes
took
to
coaxing
and
entreating
in
the
sweetest
tones
of
a
very
sweet
voice
he
became
particularly
restless
and
evidently
undecided
how
to
act
as
was
evinced
by
sundry
nervous
rubbings
of
his
nose
tights
head
and
gaiters
taking
advantage
of
these
symptoms
of
indecision
perker
to
whom
it
appeared
the
young
couple
had
driven
straight
that
morning
urged
with
legal
point
and
shrewdness
that
winkle
senior
was
still
unacquainted
with
the
important
rise
in
life
s
flight
of
steps
which
his
son
had
taken
that
the
future
expectations
of
the
said
son
depended
entirely
upon
the
said
winkle
senior
continuing
to
regard
him
with
undiminished
feelings
of
affection
and
attachment
which
it
was
very
unlikely
he
would
if
this
great
event
were
long
kept
a
secret
from
him
that
pickwick
repairing
to
bristol
to
seek
allen
might
with
equal
reason
repair
to
birmingham
to
seek
winkle
senior
lastly
that
winkle
senior
had
good
right
and
title
to
consider
pickwick
as
in
some
degree
the
guardian
and
adviser
of
his
son
and
that
it
consequently
behoved
that
gentleman
and
was
indeed
due
to
his
personal
character
to
acquaint
the
aforesaid
winkle
senior
personally
and
by
word
of
mouth
with
the
whole
circumstances
of
the
case
and
with
the
share
he
had
taken
in
the
transaction
tupman
and
snodgrass
arrived
most
opportunely
in
this
stage
of
the
pleadings
and
as
it
was
necessary
to
explain
to
them
all
that
had
occurred
together
with
the
various
reasons
pro
and
con
the
whole
of
the
arguments
were
gone
over
again
after
which
everybody
urged
every
argument
in
his
own
way
and
at
his
own
length
and
at
last
pickwick
fairly
argued
and
remonstrated
out
of
all
his
resolutions
and
being
in
imminent
danger
of
being
argued
and
remonstrated
out
of
his
wits
caught
arabella
in
his
arms
and
declaring
that
she
was
a
very
amiable
creature
and
that
he
didn
t
know
how
it
was
but
he
had
always
been
very
fond
of
her
from
the
first
said
he
could
never
find
it
in
his
heart
to
stand
in
the
way
of
young
people
s
happiness
and
they
might
do
with
him
as
they
pleased
weller
s
first
act
on
hearing
this
concession
was
to
despatch
job
trotter
to
the
illustrious
pell
with
an
authority
to
deliver
to
the
bearer
the
formal
discharge
which
his
prudent
parent
had
had
the
foresight
to
leave
in
the
hands
of
that
learned
gentleman
in
case
it
should
be
at
any
time
required
on
an
emergency
his
next
proceeding
was
to
invest
his
whole
stock
of
in
the
purchase
of
gallons
of
mild
porter
which
he
himself
dispensed
on
the
to
everybody
who
would
partake
of
it
this
done
he
hurra
d
in
divers
parts
of
the
building
until
he
lost
his
voice
and
then
quietly
relapsed
into
his
usual
collected
and
philosophical
condition
at
three
o
clock
that
afternoon
pickwick
took
a
last
look
at
his
little
room
and
made
his
way
as
well
as
he
could
through
the
throng
of
debtors
who
pressed
eagerly
forward
to
shake
him
by
the
hand
until
he
reached
the
lodge
steps
he
turned
here
to
look
about
him
and
his
eye
lightened
as
he
did
so
in
all
the
crowd
of
wan
emaciated
faces
he
saw
not
one
which
was
not
happier
for
his
sympathy
and
charity
perker
said
pickwick
beckoning
one
young
man
towards
him
this
is
jingle
whom
i
spoke
to
you
very
good
my
dear
sir
replied
perker
looking
hard
at
jingle
you
will
see
me
again
young
man
i
hope
you
may
live
to
remember
and
feel
deeply
what
i
shall
have
to
communicate
jingle
bowed
respectfully
trembled
very
much
as
he
took
pickwick
s
proffered
hand
and
withdrew
job
you
know
i
think
said
pickwick
presenting
that
gentleman
i
know
the
rascal
replied
perker
see
after
your
friend
and
be
in
the
way
at
one
do
you
hear
now
is
there
anything
more
nothing
rejoined
pickwick
you
have
delivered
the
little
parcel
i
gave
you
for
your
old
landlord
sam
i
have
sir
replied
sam
he
bust
out
sir
and
said
you
wos
wery
gen
rous
and
thoughtful
and
he
only
wished
you
could
have
him
innockilated
for
a
gallopin
consumption
for
his
old
friend
as
had
lived
here
so
long
wos
dead
and
he
d
noweres
to
look
for
poor
fellow
poor
fellow
said
pickwick
god
bless
you
my
friends
as
pickwick
uttered
this
adieu
the
crowd
raised
a
loud
shout
many
among
them
were
pressing
forward
to
shake
him
by
the
hand
again
when
he
drew
his
arm
through
perker
s
and
hurried
from
the
prison
far
more
sad
and
melancholy
for
the
moment
than
when
he
had
first
entered
it
alas
how
many
sad
and
unhappy
beings
had
he
left
behind
a
happy
evening
was
that
for
at
least
one
party
in
the
george
and
vulture
and
light
and
cheerful
were
two
of
the
hearts
that
emerged
from
its
hospitable
door
next
morning
the
owners
thereof
were
pickwick
and
sam
weller
the
former
of
whom
was
speedily
deposited
inside
a
comfortable
with
a
little
dickey
behind
in
which
the
latter
mounted
with
great
agility
sir
called
out
weller
to
his
master
well
sam
replied
pickwick
thrusting
his
head
out
of
the
window
i
wish
them
horses
had
been
three
months
and
better
in
the
fleet
why
sam
inquired
pickwick
wy
sir
exclaimed
weller
rubbing
his
hands
how
they
would
go
if
they
had
been
chapter
xlviii
relates
how
pickwick
with
the
assistance
of
samuel
weller
essayed
to
soften
the
heart
of
benjamin
allen
and
to
mollify
the
wrath
of
robert
sawyer
ben
allen
and
bob
sawyer
sat
together
in
the
little
surgery
behind
the
shop
discussing
minced
veal
and
future
prospects
when
the
discourse
not
unnaturally
turned
upon
the
practice
acquired
by
bob
the
aforesaid
and
his
present
chances
of
deriving
a
competent
independence
from
the
honourable
profession
to
which
he
had
devoted
himself
which
i
think
observed
bob
sawyer
pursuing
the
thread
of
the
subject
which
i
think
ben
are
rather
what
s
rather
dubious
inquired
ben
allen
at
the
same
time
sharpening
his
intellect
with
a
draught
of
beer
what
s
dubious
why
the
chances
responded
bob
sawyer
i
forgot
said
ben
allen
the
beer
has
reminded
me
that
i
forgot
bob
yes
they
it
s
wonderful
how
the
poor
people
patronise
me
said
bob
sawyer
reflectively
they
knock
me
up
at
all
hours
of
the
night
they
take
medicine
to
an
extent
which
i
should
have
conceived
impossible
they
put
on
blisters
and
leeches
with
a
perseverance
worthy
of
a
better
cause
they
make
additions
to
their
families
in
a
manner
which
is
quite
awful
six
of
those
little
promissory
notes
all
due
on
the
same
day
ben
and
all
intrusted
to
me
it
s
very
gratifying
isn
t
it
said
ben
allen
holding
his
plate
for
some
more
minced
veal
oh
very
replied
bob
only
not
quite
so
much
so
as
the
confidence
of
patients
with
a
shilling
or
two
to
spare
would
be
this
business
was
capitally
described
in
the
advertisement
ben
it
is
a
practice
a
very
extensive
practice
and
that
s
bob
said
ben
allen
laying
down
his
knife
and
fork
and
fixing
his
eyes
on
the
visage
of
his
friend
bob
i
ll
tell
you
what
it
what
is
it
inquired
bob
sawyer
you
must
make
yourself
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
master
of
arabella
s
one
thousand
three
per
cent
consolidated
bank
annuities
now
standing
in
her
name
in
the
book
or
books
of
the
governor
and
company
of
the
bank
of
england
added
bob
sawyer
in
legal
phraseology
exactly
so
said
ben
she
has
it
when
she
comes
of
age
or
marries
she
wants
a
year
of
coming
of
age
and
if
you
plucked
up
a
spirit
she
needn
t
want
a
month
of
being
she
s
a
very
charming
and
delightful
creature
quoth
robert
sawyer
in
reply
and
has
only
one
fault
that
i
know
of
ben
it
happens
unfortunately
that
that
single
blemish
is
a
want
of
taste
she
don
t
like
it
s
my
opinion
that
she
don
t
know
what
she
does
like
said
ben
allen
contemptuously
perhaps
not
remarked
bob
sawyer
but
it
s
my
opinion
that
she
does
know
what
she
doesn
t
like
and
that
s
of
more
i
wish
said
ben
allen
setting
his
teeth
together
and
speaking
more
like
a
savage
warrior
who
fed
on
raw
wolf
s
flesh
which
he
carved
with
his
fingers
than
a
peaceable
young
gentleman
who
ate
minced
veal
with
a
knife
and
fork
i
wish
i
knew
whether
any
rascal
really
has
been
tampering
with
her
and
attempting
to
engage
her
affections
i
think
i
should
assassinate
him
i
d
put
a
bullet
in
him
if
i
found
him
out
said
sawyer
stopping
in
the
course
of
a
long
draught
of
beer
and
looking
malignantly
out
of
the
porter
pot
if
that
didn
t
do
his
business
i
d
extract
it
afterwards
and
kill
him
that
benjamin
allen
gazed
abstractedly
on
his
friend
for
some
minutes
in
silence
and
then
said
you
have
never
proposed
to
her
bob
no
because
i
saw
it
would
be
of
no
use
replied
robert
sawyer
you
shall
do
it
before
you
are
hours
older
retorted
ben
with
desperate
calmness
she
shall
have
you
or
i
ll
know
the
reason
why
i
ll
exert
my
well
said
bob
sawyer
we
shall
we
shall
see
my
friend
replied
ben
allen
fiercely
he
paused
for
a
few
seconds
and
added
in
a
voice
broken
by
emotion
you
have
loved
her
from
a
child
my
friend
you
loved
her
when
we
were
boys
at
school
together
and
even
then
she
was
wayward
and
slighted
your
young
feelings
do
you
recollect
with
all
the
eagerness
of
a
child
s
love
one
day
pressing
upon
her
acceptance
two
small
biscuits
and
one
sweet
apple
neatly
folded
into
a
circular
parcel
with
the
leaf
of
a
i
do
replied
bob
sawyer
she
slighted
that
i
think
said
ben
allen
she
did
rejoined
bob
she
said
i
had
kept
the
parcel
so
long
in
the
pockets
of
my
corduroys
that
the
apple
was
unpleasantly
i
remember
said
allen
gloomily
upon
which
we
ate
it
ourselves
in
alternate
bob
sawyer
intimated
his
recollection
of
the
circumstance
last
alluded
to
by
a
melancholy
frown
and
the
two
friends
remained
for
some
time
absorbed
each
in
his
own
meditations
while
these
observations
were
being
exchanged
between
bob
sawyer
and
benjamin
allen
and
while
the
boy
in
the
gray
livery
marvelling
at
the
unwonted
prolongation
of
the
dinner
cast
an
anxious
look
from
time
to
time
towards
the
glass
door
distracted
by
inward
misgivings
regarding
the
amount
of
minced
veal
which
would
be
ultimately
reserved
for
his
individual
cravings
there
rolled
soberly
on
through
the
streets
of
bristol
a
private
fly
painted
of
a
sad
green
colour
drawn
by
a
chubby
sort
of
brown
horse
and
driven
by
a
man
with
his
legs
dressed
like
the
legs
of
a
groom
and
his
body
attired
in
the
coat
of
a
coachman
such
appearances
are
common
to
many
vehicles
belonging
to
and
maintained
by
old
ladies
of
economic
habits
and
in
this
vehicle
sat
an
old
lady
who
was
its
mistress
and
proprietor
martin
said
the
old
lady
calling
to
the
surly
man
out
of
the
front
window
well
said
the
surly
man
touching
his
hat
to
the
old
lady
mr
sawyer
s
said
the
old
lady
i
was
going
there
said
the
surly
man
the
old
lady
nodded
the
satisfaction
which
this
proof
of
the
surly
man
s
foresight
imparted
to
her
feelings
and
the
surly
man
giving
a
smart
lash
to
the
chubby
horse
they
all
repaired
to
bob
sawyer
s
together
martin
said
the
old
lady
when
the
fly
stopped
at
the
door
of
robert
sawyer
late
nockemorf
well
said
martin
ask
the
lad
to
step
out
and
mind
the
i
m
going
to
mind
the
horse
myself
said
martin
laying
his
whip
on
the
roof
of
the
fly
i
can
t
permit
it
on
any
account
said
the
old
lady
your
testimony
will
be
very
important
and
i
must
take
you
into
the
house
with
me
you
must
not
stir
from
my
side
during
the
whole
interview
do
you
hear
i
hear
replied
martin
well
what
are
you
stopping
for
nothing
replied
martin
so
saying
the
surly
man
leisurely
descended
from
the
wheel
on
which
he
had
been
poising
himself
on
the
tops
of
the
toes
of
his
right
foot
and
having
summoned
the
boy
in
the
gray
livery
opened
the
coach
door
flung
down
the
steps
and
thrusting
in
a
hand
enveloped
in
a
dark
glove
pulled
out
the
old
lady
with
as
much
unconcern
in
his
manner
as
if
she
were
a
bandbox
dear
me
exclaimed
the
old
lady
i
am
so
flurried
now
i
have
got
here
martin
that
i
m
all
in
a
martin
coughed
behind
the
dark
gloves
but
expressed
no
sympathy
so
the
old
lady
composing
herself
trotted
up
bob
sawyer
s
steps
and
martin
followed
immediately
on
the
old
lady
s
entering
the
shop
benjamin
allen
and
bob
sawyer
who
had
been
putting
the
out
of
sight
and
upsetting
nauseous
drugs
to
take
off
the
smell
of
the
tobacco
smoke
issued
hastily
forth
in
a
transport
of
pleasure
and
affection
my
dear
aunt
exclaimed
ben
allen
how
kind
of
you
to
look
in
upon
us
sawyer
aunt
my
friend
bob
sawyer
whom
i
have
spoken
to
you
about
regarding
you
know
and
here
ben
allen
who
was
not
at
the
moment
extraordinarily
sober
added
the
word
arabella
in
what
was
meant
to
be
a
whisper
but
which
was
an
especially
audible
and
distinct
tone
of
speech
which
nobody
could
avoid
hearing
if
anybody
were
so
disposed
my
dear
benjamin
said
the
old
lady
struggling
with
a
great
shortness
of
breath
and
trembling
from
head
to
foot
don
t
be
alarmed
my
dear
but
i
think
i
had
better
speak
to
sawyer
alone
for
a
moment
only
for
one
bob
said
allen
will
you
take
my
aunt
into
the
surgery
certainly
responded
bob
in
a
most
professional
voice
step
this
way
my
dear
ma
am
don
t
be
frightened
ma
am
we
shall
be
able
to
set
you
to
rights
in
a
very
short
time
i
have
no
doubt
ma
am
here
my
dear
ma
am
now
then
with
this
bob
sawyer
having
handed
the
old
lady
to
a
chair
shut
the
door
drew
another
chair
close
to
her
and
waited
to
hear
detailed
the
symptoms
of
some
disorder
from
which
he
saw
in
perspective
a
long
train
of
profits
and
advantages
the
first
thing
the
old
lady
did
was
to
shake
her
head
a
great
many
times
and
began
to
cry
nervous
said
bob
sawyer
complacently
and
water
three
times
a
day
and
composing
draught
at
i
don
t
know
how
to
begin
sawyer
said
the
old
lady
it
is
so
very
painful
and
you
need
not
begin
ma
am
rejoined
bob
sawyer
i
can
anticipate
all
you
would
say
the
head
is
in
i
should
be
very
sorry
to
think
it
was
the
heart
said
the
old
lady
with
a
slight
groan
not
the
slightest
danger
of
that
ma
am
replied
bob
sawyer
the
stomach
is
the
primary
mr
sawyer
exclaimed
the
old
lady
starting
not
the
least
doubt
of
it
ma
am
rejoined
bob
looking
wondrous
wise
medicine
in
time
my
dear
ma
am
would
have
prevented
it
mr
sawyer
said
the
old
lady
more
flurried
than
before
this
conduct
is
either
great
impertinence
to
one
in
my
situation
sir
or
it
arises
from
your
not
understanding
the
object
of
my
visit
if
it
had
been
in
the
power
of
medicine
or
any
foresight
i
could
have
used
to
prevent
what
has
occurred
i
should
certainly
have
done
so
i
had
better
see
my
nephew
at
once
said
the
old
lady
twirling
her
reticule
indignantly
and
rising
as
she
spoke
stop
a
moment
ma
am
said
bob
sawyer
i
m
afraid
i
have
not
understood
you
what
the
matter
ma
am
my
niece
sawyer
said
the
old
lady
your
friend
s
yes
ma
am
said
bob
all
impatience
for
the
old
lady
although
much
agitated
spoke
with
the
most
tantalising
deliberation
as
old
ladies
often
do
yes
ma
left
my
home
sawyer
three
days
ago
on
a
pretended
visit
to
my
sister
another
aunt
of
hers
who
keeps
the
large
just
beyond
the
third
where
there
is
a
very
large
and
an
oak
gate
said
the
old
lady
stopping
in
this
place
to
dry
her
eyes
oh
devil
take
the
ma
am
said
bob
quite
forgetting
his
professional
dignity
in
his
anxiety
get
on
a
little
faster
put
a
little
more
steam
on
ma
am
this
morning
said
the
old
lady
slowly
this
morning
she
she
came
back
ma
am
i
suppose
said
bob
with
great
animation
did
she
come
back
no
she
did
not
she
wrote
replied
the
old
lady
what
did
she
say
inquired
bob
eagerly
she
said
sawyer
replied
the
old
lady
and
it
is
this
i
want
to
prepare
benjamin
s
mind
for
gently
and
by
degrees
she
said
that
she
was
i
have
got
the
letter
in
my
pocket
sawyer
but
my
glasses
are
in
the
carriage
and
i
should
only
waste
your
time
if
i
attempted
to
point
out
the
passage
to
you
without
them
she
said
in
short
sawyer
that
she
was
what
said
or
rather
shouted
bob
sawyer
married
repeated
the
old
lady
bob
sawyer
stopped
to
hear
no
more
but
darting
from
the
surgery
into
the
outer
shop
cried
in
a
stentorian
voice
ben
my
boy
she
s
bolted
ben
allen
who
had
been
slumbering
behind
the
counter
with
his
head
half
a
foot
or
so
below
his
knees
no
sooner
heard
this
appalling
communication
than
he
made
a
precipitate
rush
at
martin
and
twisting
his
hand
in
the
of
that
taciturn
servitor
expressed
an
obliging
intention
of
choking
him
where
he
stood
this
intention
with
a
promptitude
often
the
effect
of
desperation
he
at
once
commenced
carrying
into
execution
with
much
vigour
and
surgical
skill
martin
who
was
a
man
of
few
words
and
possessed
but
little
power
of
eloquence
or
persuasion
submitted
to
this
operation
with
a
very
calm
and
agreeable
expression
of
countenance
for
some
seconds
finding
however
that
it
threatened
speedily
to
lead
to
a
result
which
would
place
it
beyond
his
power
to
claim
any
wages
board
or
otherwise
in
all
time
to
come
he
muttered
an
inarticulate
remonstrance
and
felled
benjamin
allen
to
the
ground
as
that
gentleman
had
his
hands
entangled
in
his
cravat
he
had
no
alternative
but
to
follow
him
to
the
floor
there
they
both
lay
struggling
when
the
shop
door
opened
and
the
party
was
increased
by
the
arrival
of
two
most
unexpected
visitors
to
wit
pickwick
and
samuel
weller
the
impression
at
once
produced
on
weller
s
mind
by
what
he
saw
was
that
martin
was
hired
by
the
establishment
of
sawyer
late
nockemorf
to
take
strong
medicine
or
to
go
into
fits
and
be
experimentalised
upon
or
to
swallow
poison
now
and
then
with
the
view
of
testing
the
efficacy
of
some
new
antidotes
or
to
do
something
or
other
to
promote
the
great
science
of
medicine
and
gratify
the
ardent
spirit
of
inquiry
burning
in
the
bosoms
of
its
two
young
professors
so
without
presuming
to
interfere
sam
stood
perfectly
still
and
looked
on
as
if
he
were
mightily
interested
in
the
result
of
the
then
pending
experiment
not
so
pickwick
he
at
once
threw
himself
on
the
astonished
combatants
with
his
accustomed
energy
and
loudly
called
upon
the
bystanders
to
interpose
this
roused
bob
sawyer
who
had
been
hitherto
quite
paralysed
by
the
frenzy
of
his
companion
with
that
gentleman
s
assistance
pickwick
raised
ben
allen
to
his
feet
martin
finding
himself
alone
on
the
floor
got
up
and
looked
about
him
mr
allen
said
pickwick
what
is
the
matter
sir
never
mind
sir
replied
allen
with
haughty
defiance
what
is
it
inquired
pickwick
looking
at
bob
sawyer
is
he
unwell
before
bob
could
reply
ben
allen
seized
pickwick
by
the
hand
and
murmured
in
sorrowful
accents
my
sister
my
dear
sir
my
oh
is
that
all
said
pickwick
we
shall
easily
arrange
that
matter
i
hope
your
sister
is
safe
and
well
and
i
am
here
my
dear
sir
to
sorry
to
do
anythin
as
may
cause
an
interruption
to
such
wery
pleasant
proceedin
s
as
the
king
said
wen
he
dissolved
the
parliament
interposed
weller
who
had
been
peeping
through
the
glass
door
but
there
s
another
experiment
here
sir
here
s
a
wenerable
old
lady
a
lyin
on
the
carpet
waitin
for
dissection
or
galwinism
or
some
other
rewivin
and
scientific
i
forgot
exclaimed
ben
allen
it
is
my
dear
me
said
pickwick
poor
lady
gently
sam
strange
sitivation
for
one
o
the
family
observed
sam
weller
hoisting
the
aunt
into
a
chair
now
depitty
sawbones
bring
out
the
wollatilly
the
latter
observation
was
addressed
to
the
boy
in
gray
who
having
handed
over
the
fly
to
the
care
of
the
had
come
back
to
see
what
all
the
noise
was
about
between
the
boy
in
gray
and
bob
sawyer
and
benjamin
allen
who
having
frightened
his
aunt
into
a
fainting
fit
was
affectionately
solicitous
for
her
recovery
the
old
lady
was
at
length
restored
to
consciousness
then
ben
allen
turning
with
a
puzzled
countenance
to
pickwick
asked
him
what
he
was
about
to
say
when
he
had
been
so
alarmingly
interrupted
we
are
all
friends
here
i
presume
said
pickwick
clearing
his
voice
and
looking
towards
the
man
of
few
words
with
the
surly
countenance
who
drove
the
fly
with
the
chubby
horse
this
reminded
bob
sawyer
that
the
boy
in
gray
was
looking
on
with
eyes
wide
open
and
greedy
ears
the
incipient
chemist
having
been
lifted
up
by
his
coat
collar
and
dropped
outside
the
door
bob
sawyer
assured
pickwick
that
he
might
speak
without
reserve
your
sister
my
dear
sir
said
pickwick
turning
to
benjamin
allen
is
in
london
well
and
her
happiness
is
no
object
to
me
sir
said
benjamin
allen
with
a
flourish
of
the
hand
her
husband
an
object
to
sir
said
bob
sawyer
he
shall
be
an
object
to
me
sir
at
twelve
paces
and
a
pretty
object
i
ll
make
of
him
sir
a
scoundrel
this
as
it
stood
was
a
very
pretty
denunciation
and
magnanimous
withal
but
bob
sawyer
rather
weakened
its
effect
by
winding
up
with
some
general
observations
concerning
the
punching
of
heads
and
knocking
out
of
eyes
which
were
commonplace
by
comparison
stay
sir
said
pickwick
before
you
apply
those
epithets
to
the
gentleman
in
question
consider
dispassionately
the
extent
of
his
fault
and
above
all
remember
that
he
is
a
friend
of
what
said
bob
sawyer
his
name
cried
ben
allen
his
name
mr
nathaniel
winkle
said
pickwick
benjamin
allen
deliberately
crushed
his
spectacles
beneath
the
heel
of
his
boot
and
having
picked
up
the
pieces
and
put
them
into
three
separate
pockets
folded
his
arms
bit
his
lips
and
looked
in
a
threatening
manner
at
the
bland
features
of
pickwick
then
it
s
you
is
it
sir
who
have
encouraged
and
brought
about
this
match
inquired
benjamin
allen
at
length
and
it
s
this
gentleman
s
servant
i
suppose
interrupted
the
old
lady
who
has
been
skulking
about
my
house
and
endeavouring
to
entrap
my
servants
to
conspire
against
their
martin
well
said
the
surly
man
coming
forward
is
that
the
young
man
you
saw
in
the
lane
whom
you
told
me
about
this
morning
martin
who
as
it
has
already
appeared
was
a
man
of
few
words
looked
at
sam
weller
nodded
his
head
and
growled
forth
that
s
the
weller
who
was
never
proud
gave
a
smile
of
friendly
recognition
as
his
eyes
encountered
those
of
the
surly
groom
and
admitted
in
courteous
terms
that
he
had
knowed
him
and
this
is
the
faithful
creature
exclaimed
ben
allen
whom
i
had
nearly
suffocated
mr
pickwick
how
dare
you
allow
your
fellow
to
be
employed
in
the
abduction
of
my
sister
i
demand
that
you
explain
this
matter
explain
it
sir
cried
bob
sawyer
fiercely
it
s
a
conspiracy
said
ben
allen
a
regular
plant
added
bob
sawyer
a
disgraceful
imposition
observed
the
old
lady
nothing
but
a
do
remarked
martin
pray
hear
me
urged
pickwick
as
ben
allen
fell
into
a
chair
that
patients
were
bled
in
and
gave
way
to
his
i
have
rendered
no
assistance
in
this
matter
beyond
being
present
at
one
interview
between
the
young
people
which
i
could
not
prevent
and
from
which
i
conceived
my
presence
would
remove
any
slight
colouring
of
impropriety
that
it
might
otherwise
have
had
this
is
the
whole
share
i
have
had
in
the
transaction
and
i
had
no
suspicion
that
an
immediate
marriage
was
even
contemplated
though
mind
added
pickwick
hastily
checking
himself
mind
i
do
not
say
i
should
have
prevented
it
if
i
had
known
that
it
was
you
hear
that
all
of
you
you
hear
that
said
benjamin
allen
i
hope
they
do
mildly
observed
pickwick
looking
round
and
added
that
gentleman
his
colour
mounting
as
he
spoke
i
hope
they
hear
this
sir
also
that
from
what
has
been
stated
to
me
sir
i
assert
that
you
were
by
no
means
justified
in
attempting
to
force
your
sister
s
inclinations
as
you
did
and
that
you
should
rather
have
endeavoured
by
your
kindness
and
forbearance
to
have
supplied
the
place
of
other
nearer
relations
whom
she
had
never
known
from
a
child
as
regards
my
young
friend
i
must
beg
to
add
that
in
every
point
of
worldly
advantage
he
is
at
least
on
an
equal
footing
with
yourself
if
not
on
a
much
better
one
and
that
unless
i
hear
this
question
discussed
with
becoming
temper
and
moderation
i
decline
hearing
any
more
said
upon
the
i
wish
to
make
a
wery
few
remarks
in
addition
to
wot
has
been
put
for
ard
by
the
honourable
gen
l
m
n
as
has
jist
give
over
said
weller
stepping
forth
wich
is
this
here
a
indiwidual
in
company
has
called
me
a
that
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
matter
sam
interposed
pickwick
pray
hold
your
i
ain
t
to
say
nothin
on
that
ere
pint
sir
replied
sam
but
merely
this
here
p
raps
that
gen
l
m
n
may
think
as
there
wos
a
priory
tachment
but
there
worn
t
nothin
o
the
sort
for
the
young
lady
said
in
the
wery
beginnin
o
the
keepin
company
that
she
couldn
t
abide
him
nobody
s
cut
him
out
and
it
ud
ha
been
jist
the
wery
same
for
him
if
the
young
lady
had
never
seen
vinkle
that
s
what
i
wished
to
say
sir
and
i
hope
i
ve
now
made
that
ere
gen
l
m
n
s
mind
easy
a
short
pause
followed
these
consolatory
remarks
of
weller
then
ben
allen
rising
from
his
chair
protested
that
he
would
never
see
arabella
s
face
again
while
bob
sawyer
despite
sam
s
flattering
assurance
vowed
dreadful
vengeance
on
the
happy
bridegroom
but
just
when
matters
were
at
their
height
and
threatening
to
remain
so
pickwick
found
a
powerful
assistant
in
the
old
lady
who
evidently
much
struck
by
the
mode
in
which
he
had
advocated
her
niece
s
cause
ventured
to
approach
benjamin
allen
with
a
few
comforting
reflections
of
which
the
chief
were
that
after
all
perhaps
it
was
well
it
was
no
worse
the
least
said
the
soonest
mended
and
upon
her
word
she
did
not
know
that
it
was
so
very
bad
after
all
what
was
over
couldn
t
be
begun
and
what
couldn
t
be
cured
must
be
endured
with
various
other
assurances
of
the
like
novel
and
strengthening
description
to
all
of
these
benjamin
allen
replied
that
he
meant
no
disrespect
to
his
aunt
or
anybody
there
but
if
it
were
all
the
same
to
them
and
they
would
allow
him
to
have
his
own
way
he
would
rather
have
the
pleasure
of
hating
his
sister
till
death
and
after
it
at
length
when
this
determination
had
been
announced
half
a
hundred
times
the
old
lady
suddenly
bridling
up
and
looking
very
majestic
wished
to
know
what
she
had
done
that
no
respect
was
to
be
paid
to
her
years
or
station
and
that
she
should
be
obliged
to
beg
and
pray
in
that
way
of
her
own
nephew
whom
she
remembered
about
years
before
he
was
born
and
whom
she
had
known
personally
when
he
hadn
t
a
tooth
in
his
head
to
say
nothing
of
her
presence
on
the
first
occasion
of
his
having
his
hair
cut
and
assistance
at
numerous
other
times
and
ceremonies
during
his
babyhood
of
sufficient
importance
to
found
a
claim
upon
his
affection
obedience
and
sympathies
for
ever
while
the
good
lady
was
bestowing
this
objurgation
on
ben
allen
bob
sawyer
and
pickwick
had
retired
in
close
conversation
to
the
inner
room
where
sawyer
was
observed
to
apply
himself
several
times
to
the
mouth
of
a
black
bottle
under
the
influence
of
which
his
features
gradually
assumed
a
cheerful
and
even
jovial
expression
and
at
last
he
emerged
from
the
room
bottle
in
hand
and
remarking
that
he
was
very
sorry
to
say
he
had
been
making
a
fool
of
himself
begged
to
propose
the
health
and
happiness
of
and
winkle
whose
felicity
so
far
from
envying
he
would
be
the
first
to
congratulate
them
upon
hearing
this
ben
allen
suddenly
arose
from
his
chair
and
seizing
the
black
bottle
drank
the
toast
so
heartily
that
the
liquor
being
strong
he
became
nearly
as
black
in
the
face
as
the
bottle
finally
the
black
bottle
went
round
till
it
was
empty
and
there
was
so
much
shaking
of
hands
and
interchanging
of
compliments
that
even
the
martin
condescended
to
smile
and
now
said
bob
sawyer
rubbing
his
hands
we
ll
have
a
jolly
i
am
sorry
said
pickwick
that
i
must
return
to
my
inn
i
have
not
been
accustomed
to
fatigue
lately
and
my
journey
has
tired
me
you
ll
take
some
tea
pickwick
said
the
old
lady
with
irresistible
sweetness
thank
you
i
would
rather
not
replied
that
gentleman
the
truth
is
that
the
old
lady
s
evidently
increasing
admiration
was
pickwick
s
principal
inducement
for
going
away
he
thought
of
bardell
and
every
glance
of
the
old
lady
s
eyes
threw
him
into
a
cold
perspiration
as
pickwick
could
by
no
means
be
prevailed
upon
to
stay
it
was
arranged
at
once
on
his
own
proposition
that
benjamin
allen
should
accompany
him
on
his
journey
to
the
elder
winkle
s
and
that
the
coach
should
be
at
the
door
at
nine
o
clock
next
morning
he
then
took
his
leave
and
followed
by
samuel
weller
repaired
to
the
bush
it
is
worthy
of
remark
that
martin
s
face
was
horribly
convulsed
as
he
shook
hands
with
sam
at
parting
and
that
he
gave
vent
to
a
smile
and
an
oath
simultaneously
from
which
tokens
it
has
been
inferred
by
those
who
were
best
acquainted
with
that
gentleman
s
peculiarities
that
he
expressed
himself
much
pleased
with
weller
s
society
and
requested
the
honour
of
his
further
acquaintance
shall
i
order
a
private
room
sir
inquired
sam
when
they
reached
the
bush
why
no
sam
replied
pickwick
as
i
dined
in
the
and
shall
go
to
bed
soon
it
is
hardly
worth
while
see
who
there
is
in
the
travellers
room
weller
departed
on
his
errand
and
presently
returned
to
say
that
there
was
only
a
gentleman
with
one
eye
and
that
he
and
the
landlord
were
drinking
a
bowl
of
bishop
together
i
will
join
them
said
pickwick
he
s
a
queer
customer
the
vun
sir
observed
weller
as
he
led
the
way
he
s
that
ere
landlord
he
is
sir
till
he
don
t
rightly
know
wether
he
s
on
the
soles
of
his
boots
or
the
crown
of
his
the
individual
to
whom
this
observation
referred
was
sitting
at
the
upper
end
of
the
room
when
pickwick
entered
and
was
smoking
a
large
dutch
pipe
with
his
eye
intently
fixed
on
the
round
face
of
the
landlord
a
old
personage
to
whom
he
had
recently
been
relating
some
tale
of
wonder
as
was
testified
by
sundry
disjointed
exclamations
of
well
i
wouldn
t
have
believed
it
the
strangest
thing
i
ever
heard
couldn
t
have
supposed
it
possible
and
other
expressions
of
astonishment
which
burst
spontaneously
from
his
lips
as
he
returned
the
fixed
gaze
of
the
man
servant
sir
said
the
man
to
pickwick
fine
night
very
much
so
indeed
replied
pickwick
as
the
waiter
placed
a
small
decanter
of
brandy
and
some
hot
water
before
him
while
pickwick
was
mixing
his
the
man
looked
round
at
him
earnestly
from
time
to
time
and
at
length
said
i
think
i
ve
seen
you
i
don
t
recollect
you
rejoined
pickwick
i
dare
say
not
said
the
man
you
didn
t
know
me
but
i
knew
two
friends
of
yours
that
were
stopping
at
the
peacock
at
eatanswill
at
the
time
of
the
oh
indeed
exclaimed
pickwick
yes
rejoined
the
man
i
mentioned
a
little
circumstance
to
them
about
a
friend
of
mine
of
the
name
of
tom
smart
perhaps
you
ve
heard
them
speak
of
often
rejoined
pickwick
smiling
he
was
your
uncle
i
think
no
no
only
a
friend
of
my
uncle
s
replied
the
man
he
was
a
wonderful
man
that
uncle
of
yours
though
remarked
the
landlord
shaking
his
head
well
i
think
he
was
i
think
i
may
say
he
was
answered
the
man
i
could
tell
you
a
story
about
that
same
uncle
gentlemen
that
would
rather
surprise
could
you
said
pickwick
let
us
hear
it
by
all
the
bagman
ladled
out
a
glass
of
negus
from
the
bowl
and
drank
it
smoked
a
long
whiff
out
of
the
dutch
pipe
and
then
calling
to
sam
weller
who
was
lingering
near
the
door
that
he
needn
t
go
away
unless
he
wanted
to
because
the
story
was
no
secret
fixed
his
eye
upon
the
landlord
s
and
proceeded
in
the
words
of
the
next
chapter
chapter
xlix
containing
the
story
of
the
bagman
s
uncle
my
uncle
gentlemen
said
the
bagman
was
one
of
the
merriest
pleasantest
cleverest
fellows
that
ever
lived
i
wish
you
had
known
him
gentlemen
on
second
thoughts
gentlemen
i
don
t
wish
you
had
known
him
for
if
you
had
you
would
have
been
all
by
this
time
in
the
ordinary
course
of
nature
if
not
dead
at
all
events
so
near
it
as
to
have
taken
to
stopping
at
home
and
giving
up
company
which
would
have
deprived
me
of
the
inestimable
pleasure
of
addressing
you
at
this
moment
gentlemen
i
wish
your
fathers
and
mothers
had
known
my
uncle
they
would
have
been
amazingly
fond
of
him
especially
your
respectable
mothers
i
know
they
would
if
any
two
of
his
numerous
virtues
predominated
over
the
many
that
adorned
his
character
i
should
say
they
were
his
mixed
punch
and
his
song
excuse
my
dwelling
on
these
melancholy
recollections
of
departed
worth
you
won
t
see
a
man
like
my
uncle
every
day
in
the
week
i
have
always
considered
it
a
great
point
in
my
uncle
s
character
gentlemen
that
he
was
the
intimate
friend
and
companion
of
tom
smart
of
the
great
house
of
bilson
and
slum
cateaton
street
city
my
uncle
collected
for
tiggin
and
welps
but
for
a
long
time
he
went
pretty
near
the
same
journey
as
tom
and
the
very
first
night
they
met
my
uncle
took
a
fancy
for
tom
and
tom
took
a
fancy
for
my
uncle
they
made
a
bet
of
a
new
hat
before
they
had
known
each
other
half
an
hour
who
should
brew
the
best
quart
of
punch
and
drink
it
the
quickest
my
uncle
was
judged
to
have
won
the
making
but
tom
smart
beat
him
in
the
drinking
by
about
half
a
they
took
another
quart
apiece
to
drink
each
other
s
health
in
and
were
staunch
friends
ever
afterwards
there
s
a
destiny
in
these
things
gentlemen
we
can
t
help
it
in
personal
appearance
my
uncle
was
a
trifle
shorter
than
the
middle
size
he
was
a
thought
stouter
too
than
the
ordinary
run
of
people
and
perhaps
his
face
might
be
a
shade
redder
he
had
the
jolliest
face
you
ever
saw
gentleman
something
like
punch
with
a
handsome
nose
and
chin
his
eyes
were
always
twinkling
and
sparkling
with
and
a
smile
not
one
of
your
unmeaning
wooden
grins
but
a
real
merry
hearty
smile
was
perpetually
on
his
countenance
he
was
pitched
out
of
his
gig
once
and
knocked
head
first
against
a
milestone
there
he
lay
stunned
and
so
cut
about
the
face
with
some
gravel
which
had
been
heaped
up
alongside
it
that
to
use
my
uncle
s
own
strong
expression
if
his
mother
could
have
revisited
the
earth
she
wouldn
t
have
known
him
indeed
when
i
come
to
think
of
the
matter
gentlemen
i
feel
pretty
sure
she
wouldn
t
for
she
died
when
my
uncle
was
two
years
and
seven
months
old
and
i
think
it
s
very
likely
that
even
without
the
gravel
his
would
have
puzzled
the
good
lady
not
a
little
to
say
nothing
of
his
jolly
red
face
however
there
he
lay
and
i
have
heard
my
uncle
say
many
a
time
that
the
man
said
who
picked
him
up
that
he
was
smiling
as
merrily
as
if
he
had
tumbled
out
for
a
treat
and
that
after
they
had
bled
him
the
first
faint
glimmerings
of
returning
animation
were
his
jumping
up
in
bed
bursting
out
into
a
loud
laugh
kissing
the
young
woman
who
held
the
basin
and
demanding
a
mutton
chop
and
a
pickled
walnut
he
was
very
fond
of
pickled
walnuts
gentlemen
he
said
he
always
found
that
taken
without
vinegar
they
relished
the
beer
my
uncle
s
great
journey
was
in
the
fall
of
the
leaf
at
which
time
he
collected
debts
and
took
orders
in
the
north
going
from
london
to
edinburgh
from
edinburgh
to
glasgow
from
glasgow
back
to
edinburgh
and
thence
to
london
by
the
smack
you
are
to
understand
that
his
second
visit
to
edinburgh
was
for
his
own
pleasure
he
used
to
go
back
for
a
week
just
to
look
up
his
old
friends
and
what
with
breakfasting
with
this
one
lunching
with
that
dining
with
the
third
and
supping
with
another
a
pretty
tight
week
he
used
to
make
of
it
i
don
t
know
whether
any
of
you
gentlemen
ever
partook
of
a
real
substantial
hospitable
scotch
breakfast
and
then
went
out
to
a
slight
lunch
of
a
bushel
of
oysters
a
dozen
or
so
of
bottled
ale
and
a
noggin
or
two
of
whiskey
to
close
up
with
if
you
ever
did
you
will
agree
with
me
that
it
requires
a
pretty
strong
head
to
go
out
to
dinner
and
supper
afterwards
but
bless
your
hearts
and
eyebrows
all
this
sort
of
thing
was
nothing
to
my
uncle
he
was
so
well
seasoned
that
it
was
mere
child
s
play
i
have
heard
him
say
that
he
could
see
the
dundee
people
out
any
day
and
walk
home
afterwards
without
staggering
and
yet
the
dundee
people
have
as
strong
heads
and
as
strong
punch
gentlemen
as
you
are
likely
to
meet
with
between
the
poles
i
have
heard
of
a
glasgow
man
and
a
dundee
man
drinking
against
each
other
for
fifteen
hours
at
a
sitting
they
were
both
suffocated
as
nearly
as
could
be
ascertained
at
the
same
moment
but
with
this
trifling
exception
gentlemen
they
were
not
a
bit
the
worse
for
it
one
night
within
hours
of
the
time
when
he
had
settled
to
take
shipping
for
london
my
uncle
supped
at
the
house
of
a
very
old
friend
of
his
a
bailie
mac
something
and
four
syllables
after
it
who
lived
in
the
old
town
of
edinburgh
there
were
the
bailie
s
wife
and
the
bailie
s
three
daughters
and
the
bailie
s
son
and
three
or
four
stout
bushy
canny
old
scotch
fellows
that
the
bailie
had
got
together
to
do
honour
to
my
uncle
and
help
to
make
merry
it
was
a
glorious
supper
there
was
kippered
salmon
and
finnan
haddocks
and
a
lamb
s
head
and
a
haggis
a
celebrated
scotch
dish
gentlemen
which
my
uncle
used
to
say
always
looked
to
him
when
it
came
to
table
very
much
like
a
cupid
s
stomach
and
a
great
many
other
things
besides
that
i
forget
the
names
of
but
very
good
things
notwithstanding
the
lassies
were
pretty
and
agreeable
the
bailie
s
wife
was
one
of
the
best
creatures
that
ever
lived
and
my
uncle
was
in
thoroughly
good
cue
the
consequence
of
which
was
that
the
young
ladies
tittered
and
giggled
and
the
old
lady
laughed
out
loud
and
the
bailie
and
the
other
old
fellows
roared
till
they
were
red
in
the
face
the
whole
mortal
time
i
don
t
quite
recollect
how
many
tumblers
of
toddy
each
man
drank
after
supper
but
this
i
know
that
about
one
o
clock
in
the
morning
the
bailie
s
son
became
insensible
while
attempting
the
first
verse
of
willie
brewed
a
peck
o
maut
and
he
having
been
for
half
an
hour
before
the
only
other
man
visible
above
the
mahogany
it
occurred
to
my
uncle
that
it
was
almost
time
to
think
about
going
especially
as
drinking
had
set
in
at
seven
o
clock
in
order
that
he
might
get
home
at
a
decent
hour
but
thinking
it
might
not
be
quite
polite
to
go
just
then
my
uncle
voted
himself
into
the
chair
mixed
another
glass
rose
to
propose
his
own
health
addressed
himself
in
a
neat
and
complimentary
speech
and
drank
the
toast
with
great
enthusiasm
still
nobody
woke
so
my
uncle
took
a
little
drop
more
neat
this
time
to
prevent
the
toddy
from
disagreeing
with
him
and
laying
violent
hands
on
his
hat
sallied
forth
into
the
street
it
was
a
wild
gusty
night
when
my
uncle
closed
the
bailie
s
door
and
settling
his
hat
firmly
on
his
head
to
prevent
the
wind
from
taking
it
thrust
his
hands
into
his
pockets
and
looking
upward
took
a
short
survey
of
the
state
of
the
weather
the
clouds
were
drifting
over
the
moon
at
their
giddiest
speed
at
one
time
wholly
obscuring
her
at
another
suffering
her
to
burst
forth
in
full
splendour
and
shed
her
light
on
all
the
objects
around
anon
driving
over
her
again
with
increased
velocity
and
shrouding
everything
in
darkness
really
this
won
t
do
said
my
uncle
addressing
himself
to
the
weather
as
if
he
felt
himself
personally
offended
this
is
not
at
all
the
kind
of
thing
for
my
voyage
it
will
not
do
at
any
price
said
my
uncle
very
impressively
having
repeated
this
several
times
he
recovered
his
balance
with
some
difficulty
for
he
was
rather
giddy
with
looking
up
into
the
sky
so
long
and
walked
merrily
on
the
bailie
s
house
was
in
the
canongate
and
my
uncle
was
going
to
the
other
end
of
leith
walk
rather
better
than
a
mile
s
journey
on
either
side
of
him
there
shot
up
against
the
dark
sky
tall
gaunt
straggling
houses
with
fronts
and
windows
that
seemed
to
have
shared
the
lot
of
eyes
in
mortals
and
to
have
grown
dim
and
sunken
with
age
six
seven
eight
storey
high
were
the
houses
storey
piled
upon
storey
as
children
build
with
cards
throwing
their
dark
shadows
over
the
roughly
paved
road
and
making
the
dark
night
darker
a
few
oil
lamps
were
scattered
at
long
distances
but
they
only
served
to
mark
the
dirty
entrance
to
some
narrow
close
or
to
show
where
a
common
stair
communicated
by
steep
and
intricate
windings
with
the
various
flats
above
glancing
at
all
these
things
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
had
seen
them
too
often
before
to
think
them
worthy
of
much
notice
now
my
uncle
walked
up
the
middle
of
the
street
with
a
thumb
in
each
waistcoat
pocket
indulging
from
time
to
time
in
various
snatches
of
song
chanted
forth
with
such
and
spirit
that
the
quiet
honest
folk
started
from
their
first
sleep
and
lay
trembling
in
bed
till
the
sound
died
away
in
the
distance
when
satisfying
themselves
that
it
was
only
some
drunken
ne
finding
his
way
home
they
covered
themselves
up
warm
and
fell
asleep
again
i
am
particular
in
describing
how
my
uncle
walked
up
the
middle
of
the
street
with
his
thumbs
in
his
waistcoat
pockets
gentlemen
because
as
he
often
used
to
say
and
with
great
reason
too
there
is
nothing
at
all
extraordinary
in
this
story
unless
you
distinctly
understand
at
the
beginning
that
he
was
not
by
any
means
of
a
marvellous
or
romantic
turn
gentlemen
my
uncle
walked
on
with
his
thumbs
in
his
waistcoat
pockets
taking
the
middle
of
the
street
to
himself
and
singing
now
a
verse
of
a
love
song
and
then
a
verse
of
a
drinking
one
and
when
he
was
tired
of
both
whistling
melodiously
until
he
reached
the
north
bridge
which
at
this
point
connects
the
old
and
new
towns
of
edinburgh
here
he
stopped
for
a
minute
to
look
at
the
strange
irregular
clusters
of
lights
piled
one
above
the
other
and
twinkling
afar
off
so
high
that
they
looked
like
stars
gleaming
from
the
castle
walls
on
the
one
side
and
the
calton
hill
on
the
other
as
if
they
illuminated
veritable
castles
in
the
air
while
the
old
picturesque
town
slept
heavily
on
in
gloom
and
darkness
below
its
palace
and
chapel
of
holyrood
guarded
day
and
night
as
a
friend
of
my
uncle
s
used
to
say
by
old
arthur
s
seat
towering
surly
and
dark
like
some
gruff
genius
over
the
ancient
city
he
has
watched
so
long
i
say
gentlemen
my
uncle
stopped
here
for
a
minute
to
look
about
him
and
then
paying
a
compliment
to
the
weather
which
had
a
little
cleared
up
though
the
moon
was
sinking
walked
on
again
as
royally
as
before
keeping
the
middle
of
the
road
with
great
dignity
and
looking
as
if
he
would
very
much
like
to
meet
with
somebody
who
would
dispute
possession
of
it
with
him
there
was
nobody
at
all
disposed
to
contest
the
point
as
it
happened
and
so
on
he
went
with
his
thumbs
in
his
waistcoat
pockets
like
a
lamb
when
my
uncle
reached
the
end
of
leith
walk
he
had
to
cross
a
pretty
large
piece
of
waste
ground
which
separated
him
from
a
short
street
which
he
had
to
turn
down
to
go
direct
to
his
lodging
now
in
this
piece
of
waste
ground
there
was
at
that
time
an
enclosure
belonging
to
some
wheelwright
who
contracted
with
the
post
office
for
the
purchase
of
old
mail
coaches
and
my
uncle
being
very
fond
of
coaches
old
young
or
all
at
once
took
it
into
his
head
to
step
out
of
his
road
for
no
other
purpose
than
to
peep
between
the
palings
at
these
mails
about
a
dozen
of
which
he
remembered
to
have
seen
crowded
together
in
a
very
forlorn
and
dismantled
state
inside
my
uncle
was
a
very
enthusiastic
emphatic
sort
of
person
gentlemen
so
finding
that
he
could
not
obtain
a
good
peep
between
the
palings
he
got
over
them
and
sitting
himself
quietly
down
on
an
old
began
to
contemplate
the
mail
coaches
with
a
deal
of
gravity
there
might
be
a
dozen
of
them
or
there
might
be
more
my
uncle
was
never
quite
certain
on
this
point
and
being
a
man
of
very
scrupulous
veracity
about
numbers
didn
t
like
to
say
but
there
they
stood
all
huddled
together
in
the
most
desolate
condition
imaginable
the
doors
had
been
torn
from
their
hinges
and
removed
the
linings
had
been
stripped
off
only
a
shred
hanging
here
and
there
by
a
rusty
nail
the
lamps
were
gone
the
poles
had
long
since
vanished
the
ironwork
was
rusty
the
paint
was
worn
away
the
wind
whistled
through
the
chinks
in
the
bare
woodwork
and
the
rain
which
had
collected
on
the
roofs
fell
drop
by
drop
into
the
insides
with
a
hollow
and
melancholy
sound
they
were
the
decaying
skeletons
of
departed
mails
and
in
that
lonely
place
at
that
time
of
night
they
looked
chill
and
dismal
my
uncle
rested
his
head
upon
his
hands
and
thought
of
the
busy
bustling
people
who
had
rattled
about
years
before
in
the
old
coaches
and
were
now
as
silent
and
changed
he
thought
of
the
numbers
of
people
to
whom
one
of
these
crazy
mouldering
vehicles
had
borne
night
after
night
for
many
years
and
through
all
weathers
the
anxiously
expected
intelligence
the
eagerly
remittance
the
promised
assurance
of
health
and
safety
the
sudden
announcement
of
sickness
and
death
the
merchant
the
lover
the
wife
the
widow
the
mother
the
the
very
child
who
tottered
to
the
door
at
the
postman
s
knock
how
had
they
all
looked
forward
to
the
arrival
of
the
old
coach
and
where
were
they
all
now
gentlemen
my
uncle
used
to
he
thought
all
this
at
the
time
but
i
rather
suspect
he
learned
it
out
of
some
book
afterwards
for
he
distinctly
stated
that
he
fell
into
a
kind
of
doze
as
he
sat
on
the
old
looking
at
the
decayed
mail
coaches
and
that
he
was
suddenly
awakened
by
some
deep
church
bell
striking
two
now
my
uncle
was
never
a
fast
thinker
and
if
he
had
thought
all
these
things
i
am
quite
certain
it
would
have
taken
him
till
full
two
o
clock
at
the
very
least
i
am
therefore
decidedly
of
opinion
gentlemen
that
my
uncle
fell
into
a
kind
of
doze
without
having
thought
about
anything
at
all
be
this
as
it
may
a
church
bell
struck
two
my
uncle
woke
rubbed
his
eyes
and
jumped
up
in
astonishment
in
one
instant
after
the
clock
struck
two
the
whole
of
this
deserted
and
quiet
spot
had
become
a
scene
of
most
extraordinary
life
and
animation
the
mail
coach
doors
were
on
their
hinges
the
lining
was
replaced
the
ironwork
was
as
good
as
new
the
paint
was
restored
the
lamps
were
alight
cushions
and
greatcoats
were
on
every
porters
were
thrusting
parcels
into
every
boot
guards
were
stowing
away
hostlers
were
dashing
pails
of
water
against
the
renovated
wheels
numbers
of
men
were
pushing
about
fixing
poles
into
every
coach
passengers
arrived
portmanteaus
were
handed
up
horses
were
put
to
in
short
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
every
mail
there
was
to
be
off
directly
gentlemen
my
uncle
opened
his
eyes
so
wide
at
all
this
that
to
the
very
last
moment
of
his
life
he
used
to
wonder
how
it
fell
out
that
he
had
ever
been
able
to
shut
em
again
now
then
said
a
voice
as
my
uncle
felt
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
you
re
booked
for
one
inside
you
d
better
get
i
booked
said
my
uncle
turning
round
yes
my
uncle
gentlemen
could
say
nothing
he
was
so
very
much
astonished
the
queerest
thing
of
all
was
that
although
there
was
such
a
crowd
of
persons
and
although
fresh
faces
were
pouring
in
every
moment
there
was
no
telling
where
they
came
from
they
seemed
to
start
up
in
some
strange
manner
from
the
ground
or
the
air
and
disappear
in
the
same
way
when
a
porter
had
put
his
luggage
in
the
coach
and
received
his
fare
he
turned
round
and
was
gone
and
before
my
uncle
had
well
begun
to
wonder
what
had
become
of
him
half
a
dozen
fresh
ones
started
up
and
staggered
along
under
the
weight
of
parcels
which
seemed
big
enough
to
crush
them
the
passengers
were
all
dressed
so
oddly
too
large
laced
coats
with
great
cuffs
and
no
collars
and
wigs
gentlemen
great
formal
wigs
with
a
tie
behind
my
uncle
could
make
nothing
of
it
now
are
you
going
to
get
in
said
the
person
who
had
addressed
my
uncle
before
he
was
dressed
as
a
mail
guard
with
a
wig
on
his
head
and
most
enormous
cuffs
to
his
coat
and
had
a
lantern
in
one
hand
and
a
huge
blunderbuss
in
the
other
which
he
was
going
to
stow
away
in
his
little
going
to
get
in
jack
martin
said
the
guard
holding
the
lantern
to
my
uncle
s
face
hollo
said
my
uncle
falling
back
a
step
or
two
that
s
familiar
it
s
so
on
the
said
the
guard
isn
t
there
a
mister
before
it
said
my
uncle
for
he
felt
gentlemen
that
for
a
guard
he
didn
t
know
to
call
him
jack
martin
was
a
liberty
which
the
post
office
wouldn
t
have
sanctioned
if
they
had
known
it
no
there
is
not
rejoined
the
guard
coolly
is
the
fare
paid
inquired
my
uncle
of
course
it
is
rejoined
the
guard
it
is
is
it
said
my
uncle
then
here
goes
which
coach
this
said
the
guard
pointing
to
an
edinburgh
and
london
mail
which
had
the
steps
down
and
the
door
open
stop
here
are
the
other
passengers
let
them
get
in
as
the
guard
spoke
there
all
at
once
appeared
right
in
front
of
my
uncle
a
young
gentleman
in
a
powdered
wig
and
a
coat
trimmed
with
silver
made
very
full
and
broad
in
the
skirts
which
were
lined
with
buckram
tiggin
and
welps
were
in
the
printed
calico
and
waistcoat
piece
line
gentlemen
so
my
uncle
knew
all
the
materials
at
once
he
wore
knee
breeches
and
a
kind
of
leggings
rolled
up
over
his
silk
stockings
and
shoes
with
buckles
he
had
ruffles
at
his
wrists
a
hat
on
his
head
and
a
long
taper
sword
by
his
side
the
flaps
of
his
came
down
his
thighs
and
the
ends
of
his
cravat
reached
to
his
waist
he
stalked
gravely
to
the
coach
door
pulled
off
his
hat
and
held
it
above
his
head
at
arm
s
length
cocking
his
little
finger
in
the
air
at
the
same
time
as
some
affected
people
do
when
they
take
a
cup
of
tea
then
he
drew
his
feet
together
and
made
a
low
grave
bow
and
then
put
out
his
left
hand
my
uncle
was
just
going
to
step
forward
and
shake
it
heartily
when
he
perceived
that
these
attentions
were
directed
not
towards
him
but
to
a
young
lady
who
just
then
appeared
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
attired
in
an
green
velvet
dress
with
a
long
waist
and
stomacher
she
had
no
bonnet
on
her
head
gentlemen
which
was
muffled
in
a
black
silk
hood
but
she
looked
round
for
an
instant
as
she
prepared
to
get
into
the
coach
and
such
a
beautiful
face
as
she
disclosed
my
uncle
had
never
seen
not
even
in
a
picture
she
got
into
the
coach
holding
up
her
dress
with
one
hand
and
as
my
uncle
always
said
with
a
round
oath
when
he
told
the
story
he
wouldn
t
have
believed
it
possible
that
legs
and
feet
could
have
been
brought
to
such
a
state
of
perfection
unless
he
had
seen
them
with
his
own
eyes
but
in
this
one
glimpse
of
the
beautiful
face
my
uncle
saw
that
the
young
lady
cast
an
imploring
look
upon
him
and
that
she
appeared
terrified
and
distressed
he
noticed
too
that
the
young
fellow
in
the
powdered
wig
notwithstanding
his
show
of
gallantry
which
was
all
very
fine
and
grand
clasped
her
tight
by
the
wrist
when
she
got
in
and
followed
himself
immediately
afterwards
an
uncommonly
fellow
in
a
close
brown
wig
and
a
suit
wearing
a
very
large
sword
and
boots
up
to
his
hips
belonged
to
the
party
and
when
he
sat
himself
down
next
to
the
young
lady
who
shrank
into
a
corner
at
his
approach
my
uncle
was
confirmed
in
his
original
impression
that
something
dark
and
mysterious
was
going
forward
or
as
he
always
said
himself
that
there
was
a
screw
loose
it
s
quite
surprising
how
quickly
he
made
up
his
mind
to
help
the
lady
at
any
peril
if
she
needed
any
help
death
and
lightning
exclaimed
the
young
gentleman
laying
his
hand
upon
his
sword
as
my
uncle
entered
the
coach
blood
and
thunder
roared
the
other
gentleman
with
this
he
whipped
his
sword
out
and
made
a
lunge
at
my
uncle
without
further
ceremony
my
uncle
had
no
weapon
about
him
but
with
great
dexterity
he
snatched
the
gentleman
s
hat
from
his
head
and
receiving
the
point
of
his
sword
right
through
the
crown
squeezed
the
sides
together
and
held
it
tight
pink
him
behind
cried
the
gentleman
to
his
companion
as
he
struggled
to
regain
his
sword
he
had
better
not
cried
my
uncle
displaying
the
heel
of
one
of
his
shoes
in
a
threatening
manner
i
ll
kick
his
brains
out
if
he
has
any
or
fracture
his
skull
if
he
hasn
exerting
all
his
strength
at
this
moment
my
uncle
wrenched
the
man
s
sword
from
his
grasp
and
flung
it
clean
out
of
the
coach
window
upon
which
the
younger
gentleman
vociferated
death
and
lightning
again
and
laid
his
hand
upon
the
hilt
of
his
sword
in
a
very
fierce
manner
but
didn
t
draw
it
perhaps
gentlemen
as
my
uncle
used
to
say
with
a
smile
perhaps
he
was
afraid
of
alarming
the
lady
now
gentlemen
said
my
uncle
taking
his
seat
deliberately
i
don
t
want
to
have
any
death
with
or
without
lightning
in
a
lady
s
presence
and
we
have
had
quite
blood
and
thundering
enough
for
one
journey
so
if
you
please
we
ll
sit
in
our
places
like
quiet
insides
here
guard
pick
up
that
gentleman
s
as
quickly
as
my
uncle
said
the
words
the
guard
appeared
at
the
coach
window
with
the
gentleman
s
sword
in
his
hand
he
held
up
his
lantern
and
looked
earnestly
in
my
uncle
s
face
as
he
handed
it
in
when
by
its
light
my
uncle
saw
to
his
great
surprise
that
an
immense
crowd
of
guards
swarmed
round
the
window
every
one
of
whom
had
his
eyes
earnestly
fixed
upon
him
too
he
had
never
seen
such
a
sea
of
white
faces
red
bodies
and
earnest
eyes
in
all
his
born
days
this
is
the
strangest
sort
of
thing
i
ever
had
anything
to
do
with
thought
my
uncle
allow
me
to
return
you
your
hat
the
gentleman
received
his
hat
in
silence
looked
at
the
hole
in
the
middle
with
an
inquiring
air
and
finally
stuck
it
on
the
top
of
his
wig
with
a
solemnity
the
effect
of
which
was
a
trifle
impaired
by
his
sneezing
violently
at
the
moment
and
jerking
it
off
again
all
right
cried
the
guard
with
the
lantern
mounting
into
his
little
seat
behind
away
they
went
my
uncle
peeped
out
of
the
coach
window
as
they
emerged
from
the
yard
and
observed
that
the
other
mails
with
coachmen
guards
horses
and
passengers
complete
were
driving
round
and
round
in
circles
at
a
slow
trot
of
about
five
miles
an
hour
my
uncle
burned
with
indignation
gentlemen
as
a
commercial
man
he
felt
that
the
were
not
to
be
trifled
with
and
he
resolved
to
memorialise
the
post
office
on
the
subject
the
very
instant
he
reached
london
at
present
however
his
thoughts
were
occupied
with
the
young
lady
who
sat
in
the
farthest
corner
of
the
coach
with
her
face
muffled
closely
in
her
hood
the
gentleman
with
the
coat
sitting
opposite
to
her
the
other
man
in
the
suit
by
her
side
and
both
watching
her
intently
if
she
so
much
as
rustled
the
folds
of
her
hood
he
could
hear
the
man
clap
his
hand
upon
his
sword
and
could
tell
by
the
other
s
breathing
it
was
so
dark
he
couldn
t
see
his
face
that
he
was
looking
as
big
as
if
he
were
going
to
devour
her
at
a
mouthful
this
roused
my
uncle
more
and
more
and
he
resolved
come
what
might
to
see
the
end
of
it
he
had
a
great
admiration
for
bright
eyes
and
sweet
faces
and
pretty
legs
and
feet
in
short
he
was
fond
of
the
whole
sex
it
runs
in
our
family
gentleman
so
am
i
many
were
the
devices
which
my
uncle
practised
to
attract
the
lady
s
attention
or
at
all
events
to
engage
the
mysterious
gentlemen
in
conversation
they
were
all
in
vain
the
gentlemen
wouldn
t
talk
and
the
lady
didn
t
dare
he
thrust
his
head
out
of
the
coach
window
at
intervals
and
bawled
out
to
know
why
they
didn
t
go
faster
but
he
called
till
he
was
hoarse
nobody
paid
the
least
attention
to
him
he
leaned
back
in
the
coach
and
thought
of
the
beautiful
face
and
the
feet
and
legs
this
answered
better
it
whiled
away
the
time
and
kept
him
from
wondering
where
he
was
going
and
how
it
was
that
he
found
himself
in
such
an
odd
situation
not
that
this
would
have
worried
him
much
anyway
he
was
a
mighty
free
and
easy
roving
sort
of
person
was
my
uncle
gentlemen
all
of
a
sudden
the
coach
stopped
hollo
said
my
uncle
what
s
in
the
wind
now
alight
here
said
the
guard
letting
down
the
steps
here
cried
my
uncle
here
rejoined
the
guard
i
ll
do
nothing
of
the
sort
said
my
uncle
very
well
then
stop
where
you
are
said
the
guard
i
will
said
my
uncle
do
said
the
guard
the
passengers
had
regarded
this
colloquy
with
great
attention
and
finding
that
my
uncle
was
determined
not
to
alight
the
younger
man
squeezed
past
him
to
hand
the
lady
out
at
this
moment
the
man
was
inspecting
the
hole
in
the
crown
of
his
hat
as
the
young
lady
brushed
past
she
dropped
one
of
her
gloves
into
my
uncle
s
hand
and
softly
whispered
with
her
lips
so
close
to
his
face
that
he
felt
her
warm
breath
on
his
nose
the
single
word
help
gentlemen
my
uncle
leaped
out
of
the
coach
at
once
with
such
violence
that
it
rocked
on
the
springs
again
oh
you
ve
thought
better
of
it
have
you
said
the
guard
when
he
saw
my
uncle
standing
on
the
ground
my
uncle
looked
at
the
guard
for
a
few
seconds
in
some
doubt
whether
it
wouldn
t
be
better
to
wrench
his
blunderbuss
from
him
fire
it
in
the
face
of
the
man
with
the
big
sword
knock
the
rest
of
the
company
over
the
head
with
the
stock
snatch
up
the
young
lady
and
go
off
in
the
smoke
on
second
thoughts
however
he
abandoned
this
plan
as
being
a
shade
too
melodramatic
in
the
execution
and
followed
the
two
mysterious
men
who
keeping
the
lady
between
them
were
now
entering
an
old
house
in
front
of
which
the
coach
had
stopped
they
turned
into
the
passage
and
my
uncle
followed
of
all
the
ruinous
and
desolate
places
my
uncle
had
ever
beheld
this
was
the
most
so
it
looked
as
if
it
had
once
been
a
large
house
of
entertainment
but
the
roof
had
fallen
in
in
many
places
and
the
stairs
were
steep
rugged
and
broken
there
was
a
huge
fireplace
in
the
room
into
which
they
walked
and
the
chimney
was
blackened
with
smoke
but
no
warm
blaze
lighted
it
up
now
the
white
feathery
dust
of
burned
wood
was
still
strewed
over
the
hearth
but
the
stove
was
cold
and
all
was
dark
and
gloomy
well
said
my
uncle
as
he
looked
about
him
a
mail
travelling
at
the
rate
of
six
miles
and
a
half
an
hour
and
stopping
for
an
indefinite
time
at
such
a
hole
as
this
is
rather
an
irregular
sort
of
proceeding
i
fancy
this
shall
be
made
known
i
ll
write
to
the
my
uncle
said
this
in
a
pretty
loud
voice
and
in
an
open
unreserved
sort
of
manner
with
the
view
of
engaging
the
two
strangers
in
conversation
if
he
could
but
neither
of
them
took
any
more
notice
of
him
than
whispering
to
each
other
and
scowling
at
him
as
they
did
so
the
lady
was
at
the
farther
end
of
the
room
and
once
she
ventured
to
wave
her
hand
as
if
beseeching
my
uncle
s
assistance
at
length
the
two
strangers
advanced
a
little
and
the
conversation
began
in
earnest
you
don
t
know
this
is
a
private
room
i
suppose
fellow
said
the
gentleman
in
no
i
do
not
fellow
rejoined
my
uncle
only
if
this
is
a
private
room
specially
ordered
for
the
occasion
i
should
think
the
public
room
must
be
a
one
with
this
my
uncle
sat
himself
down
in
a
chair
and
took
such
an
accurate
measure
of
the
gentleman
with
his
eyes
that
tiggin
and
welps
could
have
supplied
him
with
printed
calico
for
a
suit
and
not
an
inch
too
much
or
too
little
from
that
estimate
alone
quit
this
room
said
both
men
together
grasping
their
swords
eh
said
my
uncle
not
at
all
appearing
to
comprehend
their
meaning
quit
the
room
or
you
are
a
dead
man
said
the
fellow
with
the
large
sword
drawing
it
at
the
same
time
and
flourishing
it
in
the
air
down
with
him
cried
the
gentleman
in
drawing
his
sword
also
and
falling
back
two
or
three
yards
down
with
him
the
lady
gave
a
loud
scream
now
my
uncle
was
always
remarkable
for
great
boldness
and
great
presence
of
mind
all
the
time
that
he
had
appeared
so
indifferent
to
what
was
going
on
he
had
been
looking
slily
about
for
some
missile
or
weapon
of
defence
and
at
the
very
instant
when
the
swords
were
drawn
he
espied
standing
in
the
an
old
rapier
in
a
rusty
scabbard
at
one
bound
my
uncle
caught
it
in
his
hand
drew
it
flourished
it
gallantly
above
his
head
called
aloud
to
the
lady
to
keep
out
of
the
way
hurled
the
chair
at
the
man
in
and
the
scabbard
at
the
man
in
and
taking
advantage
of
the
confusion
fell
upon
them
both
gentlemen
there
is
an
old
story
none
the
worse
for
being
true
regarding
a
fine
young
irish
gentleman
who
being
asked
if
he
could
play
the
fiddle
replied
he
had
no
doubt
he
could
but
he
couldn
t
exactly
say
for
certain
because
he
had
never
tried
this
is
not
inapplicable
to
my
uncle
and
his
fencing
he
had
never
had
a
sword
in
his
hand
before
except
once
when
he
played
richard
the
third
at
a
private
theatre
upon
which
occasion
it
was
arranged
with
richmond
that
he
was
to
be
run
through
from
behind
without
showing
fight
at
all
but
here
he
was
cutting
and
slashing
with
two
experienced
swordsman
thrusting
and
guarding
and
poking
and
slicing
and
acquitting
himself
in
the
most
manful
and
dexterous
manner
possible
although
up
to
that
time
he
had
never
been
aware
that
he
had
the
least
notion
of
the
science
it
only
shows
how
true
the
old
saying
is
that
a
man
never
knows
what
he
can
do
till
he
tries
gentlemen
the
noise
of
the
combat
was
terrific
each
of
the
three
combatants
swearing
like
troopers
and
their
swords
clashing
with
as
much
noise
as
if
all
the
knives
and
steels
in
newport
market
were
rattling
together
at
the
same
time
when
it
was
at
its
very
height
the
lady
to
encourage
my
uncle
most
probably
withdrew
her
hood
entirely
from
her
face
and
disclosed
a
countenance
of
such
dazzling
beauty
that
he
would
have
fought
against
fifty
men
to
win
one
smile
from
it
and
die
he
had
done
wonders
before
but
now
he
began
to
powder
away
like
a
raving
mad
giant
at
this
very
moment
the
gentleman
in
turning
round
and
seeing
the
young
lady
with
her
face
uncovered
vented
an
exclamation
of
rage
and
jealousy
and
turning
his
weapon
against
her
beautiful
bosom
pointed
a
thrust
at
her
heart
which
caused
my
uncle
to
utter
a
cry
of
apprehension
that
made
the
building
ring
the
lady
stepped
lightly
aside
and
snatching
the
young
man
s
sword
from
his
hand
before
he
had
recovered
his
balance
drove
him
to
the
wall
and
running
it
through
him
and
the
panelling
up
to
the
very
hilt
pinned
him
there
hard
and
fast
it
was
a
splendid
example
my
uncle
with
a
loud
shout
of
triumph
and
a
strength
that
was
irresistible
made
his
adversary
retreat
in
the
same
direction
and
plunging
the
old
rapier
into
the
very
centre
of
a
large
red
flower
in
the
pattern
of
his
waistcoat
nailed
him
beside
his
friend
there
they
both
stood
gentlemen
jerking
their
arms
and
legs
about
in
agony
like
the
figures
that
are
moved
by
a
piece
of
my
uncle
always
said
afterwards
that
this
was
one
of
the
surest
means
he
knew
of
for
disposing
of
an
enemy
but
it
was
liable
to
one
objection
on
the
ground
of
expense
inasmuch
as
it
involved
the
loss
of
a
sword
for
every
man
disabled
the
mail
the
mail
cried
the
lady
running
up
to
my
uncle
and
throwing
her
beautiful
arms
round
his
neck
we
may
yet
may
cried
my
uncle
why
my
dear
there
s
nobody
else
to
kill
is
there
my
uncle
was
rather
disappointed
gentlemen
for
he
thought
a
little
quiet
bit
of
would
be
agreeable
after
the
slaughtering
if
it
were
only
to
change
the
subject
we
have
not
an
instant
to
lose
here
said
the
young
lady
he
pointing
to
the
young
gentleman
in
is
the
only
son
of
the
powerful
marquess
of
well
then
my
dear
i
m
afraid
he
ll
never
come
to
the
title
said
my
uncle
looking
coolly
at
the
young
gentleman
as
he
stood
fixed
up
against
the
wall
in
the
cockchafer
fashion
that
i
have
described
you
have
cut
off
the
entail
my
i
have
been
torn
from
my
home
and
my
friends
by
these
villains
said
the
young
lady
her
features
glowing
with
indignation
that
wretch
would
have
married
me
by
violence
in
another
confound
his
impudence
said
my
uncle
bestowing
a
very
contemptuous
look
on
the
dying
heir
of
filletoville
as
you
may
guess
from
what
you
have
seen
said
the
young
lady
the
party
were
prepared
to
murder
me
if
i
appealed
to
any
one
for
assistance
if
their
accomplices
find
us
here
we
are
lost
two
minutes
hence
may
be
too
late
the
mail
with
these
words
overpowered
by
her
feelings
and
the
exertion
of
sticking
the
young
marquess
of
filletoville
she
sank
into
my
uncle
s
arms
my
uncle
caught
her
up
and
bore
her
to
the
house
door
there
stood
the
mail
with
four
black
horses
ready
harnessed
but
no
coachman
no
guard
no
hostler
even
at
the
horses
heads
gentlemen
i
hope
i
do
no
injustice
to
my
uncle
s
memory
when
i
express
my
opinion
that
although
he
was
a
bachelor
he
had
held
some
ladies
in
his
arms
before
this
time
i
believe
indeed
that
he
had
rather
a
habit
of
kissing
barmaids
and
i
know
that
in
one
or
two
instances
he
had
been
seen
by
credible
witnesses
to
hug
a
landlady
in
a
very
perceptible
manner
i
mention
the
circumstance
to
show
what
a
very
uncommon
sort
of
person
this
beautiful
young
lady
must
have
been
to
have
affected
my
uncle
in
the
way
she
did
he
used
to
say
that
as
her
long
dark
hair
trailed
over
his
arm
and
her
beautiful
dark
eyes
fixed
themselves
upon
his
face
when
she
recovered
he
felt
so
strange
and
nervous
that
his
legs
trembled
beneath
him
but
who
can
look
in
a
sweet
soft
pair
of
dark
eyes
without
feeling
queer
i
can
t
gentlemen
i
am
afraid
to
look
at
some
eyes
i
know
and
that
s
the
truth
of
it
you
will
never
leave
me
murmured
the
young
lady
never
said
my
uncle
and
he
meant
it
too
my
dear
preserver
exclaimed
the
young
lady
my
dear
kind
brave
preserver
don
t
said
my
uncle
interrupting
her
why
inquired
the
young
lady
because
your
mouth
looks
so
beautiful
when
you
speak
rejoined
my
uncle
that
i
m
afraid
i
shall
be
rude
enough
to
kiss
the
young
lady
put
up
her
hand
as
if
to
caution
my
uncle
not
to
do
so
and
said
no
she
didn
t
say
anything
she
smiled
when
you
are
looking
at
a
pair
of
the
most
delicious
lips
in
the
world
and
see
them
gently
break
into
a
roguish
smile
if
you
are
very
near
them
and
nobody
else
by
you
can
not
better
testify
your
admiration
of
their
beautiful
form
and
colour
than
by
kissing
them
at
once
my
uncle
did
so
and
i
honour
him
for
it
hark
cried
the
young
lady
starting
the
noise
of
wheels
and
horses
so
it
is
said
my
uncle
listening
he
had
a
good
ear
for
wheels
and
the
trampling
of
hoofs
but
there
appeared
to
be
so
many
horses
and
carriages
rattling
towards
them
from
a
distance
that
it
was
impossible
to
form
a
guess
at
their
number
the
sound
was
like
that
of
fifty
brakes
with
six
blood
cattle
in
each
we
are
pursued
cried
the
young
lady
clasping
her
hands
we
are
pursued
i
have
no
hope
but
in
you
there
was
such
an
expression
of
terror
in
her
beautiful
face
that
my
uncle
made
up
his
mind
at
once
he
lifted
her
into
the
coach
told
her
not
to
be
frightened
pressed
his
lips
to
hers
once
more
and
then
advising
her
to
draw
up
the
window
to
keep
the
cold
air
out
mounted
to
the
box
stay
love
cried
the
young
lady
what
s
the
matter
said
my
uncle
from
the
i
want
to
speak
to
you
said
the
young
lady
only
a
word
only
one
word
must
i
get
down
inquired
my
uncle
the
lady
made
no
answer
but
she
smiled
again
such
a
smile
gentlemen
it
beat
the
other
one
all
to
nothing
my
uncle
descended
from
his
perch
in
a
twinkling
what
is
it
my
dear
said
my
uncle
looking
in
at
the
coach
window
the
lady
happened
to
bend
forward
at
the
same
time
and
my
uncle
thought
she
looked
more
beautiful
than
she
had
done
yet
he
was
very
close
to
her
just
then
gentlemen
so
he
really
ought
to
know
what
is
it
my
dear
said
my
uncle
will
you
never
love
any
one
but
me
never
marry
any
one
beside
said
the
young
lady
my
uncle
swore
a
great
oath
that
he
never
would
marry
anybody
else
and
the
young
lady
drew
in
her
head
and
pulled
up
the
window
he
jumped
upon
the
box
squared
his
elbows
adjusted
the
ribands
seized
the
whip
which
lay
on
the
roof
gave
one
flick
to
the
off
leader
and
away
went
the
four
black
horses
at
fifteen
good
english
miles
an
hour
with
the
old
behind
them
whew
how
they
tore
along
the
noise
behind
grew
louder
the
faster
the
old
mail
went
the
faster
came
the
pursuers
men
horses
dogs
were
leagued
in
the
pursuit
the
noise
was
frightful
but
above
all
rose
the
voice
of
the
young
lady
urging
my
uncle
on
and
shrieking
faster
faster
they
whirled
past
the
dark
trees
as
feathers
would
be
swept
before
a
hurricane
houses
gates
churches
haystacks
objects
of
every
kind
they
shot
by
with
a
velocity
and
noise
like
roaring
waters
suddenly
let
loose
but
still
the
noise
of
pursuit
grew
louder
and
still
my
uncle
could
hear
the
young
lady
wildly
screaming
faster
faster
my
uncle
plied
whip
and
rein
and
the
horses
flew
onward
till
they
were
white
with
foam
and
yet
the
noise
behind
increased
and
yet
the
young
lady
cried
faster
faster
my
uncle
gave
a
loud
stamp
on
the
boot
in
the
energy
of
the
moment
and
found
that
it
was
gray
morning
and
he
was
sitting
in
the
wheelwright
s
yard
on
the
box
of
an
old
edinburgh
mail
shivering
with
the
cold
and
wet
and
stamping
his
feet
to
warm
them
he
got
down
and
looked
eagerly
inside
for
the
beautiful
young
lady
alas
there
was
neither
door
nor
seat
to
the
coach
it
was
a
mere
shell
of
course
my
uncle
knew
very
well
that
there
was
some
mystery
in
the
matter
and
that
everything
had
passed
exactly
as
he
used
to
relate
it
he
remained
staunch
to
the
great
oath
he
had
sworn
to
the
beautiful
young
lady
refusing
several
eligible
landladies
on
her
account
and
dying
a
bachelor
at
last
he
always
said
what
a
curious
thing
it
was
that
he
should
have
found
out
by
such
a
mere
accident
as
his
clambering
over
the
palings
that
the
ghosts
of
and
horses
guards
coachmen
and
passengers
were
in
the
habit
of
making
journeys
regularly
every
night
he
used
to
add
that
he
believed
he
was
the
only
living
person
who
had
ever
been
taken
as
a
passenger
on
one
of
these
excursions
and
i
think
he
was
right
gentlemen
at
least
i
never
heard
of
any
i
wonder
what
these
ghosts
of
carry
in
their
bags
said
the
landlord
who
had
listened
to
the
whole
story
with
profound
attention
the
dead
letters
of
course
said
the
bagman
oh
ah
to
be
sure
rejoined
the
landlord
i
never
thought
of
chapter
how
pickwick
sped
upon
his
mission
and
how
he
was
reinforced
in
the
outset
by
a
most
unexpected
auxiliary
the
horses
were
put
to
punctually
at
a
quarter
before
nine
next
morning
and
pickwick
and
sam
weller
having
each
taken
his
seat
the
one
inside
and
the
other
out
the
postillion
was
duly
directed
to
repair
in
the
first
instance
to
bob
sawyer
s
house
for
the
purpose
of
taking
up
benjamin
allen
it
was
with
feelings
of
no
small
astonishment
when
the
carriage
drew
up
before
the
door
with
the
red
lamp
and
the
very
legible
inscription
of
sawyer
late
nockemorf
that
pickwick
saw
on
popping
his
head
out
of
the
coach
window
the
boy
in
the
gray
livery
very
busily
employed
in
putting
up
the
shutters
the
which
being
an
unusual
and
an
unbusinesslike
proceeding
at
that
hour
of
the
morning
at
once
suggested
to
his
mind
two
inferences
the
one
that
some
good
friend
and
patient
of
bob
sawyer
s
was
dead
the
other
that
bob
sawyer
himself
was
bankrupt
what
is
the
matter
said
pickwick
to
the
boy
nothing
s
the
matter
sir
replied
the
boy
expanding
his
mouth
to
the
whole
breadth
of
his
countenance
all
right
all
right
cried
bob
sawyer
suddenly
appearing
at
the
door
with
a
small
leathern
knapsack
limp
and
dirty
in
one
hand
and
a
rough
coat
and
shawl
thrown
over
the
other
arm
i
m
going
old
you
exclaimed
pickwick
yes
replied
bob
sawyer
and
a
regular
expedition
we
ll
make
of
it
here
sam
look
out
thus
briefly
bespeaking
weller
s
attention
bob
sawyer
jerked
the
leathern
knapsack
into
the
dickey
where
it
was
immediately
stowed
away
under
the
seat
by
sam
who
regarded
the
proceeding
with
great
admiration
this
done
bob
sawyer
with
the
assistance
of
the
boy
forcibly
worked
himself
into
the
rough
coat
which
was
a
few
sizes
too
small
for
him
and
then
advancing
to
the
coach
window
thrust
in
his
head
and
laughed
boisterously
what
a
start
it
is
isn
t
it
cried
bob
wiping
the
tears
out
of
his
eyes
with
one
of
the
cuffs
of
the
rough
coat
my
dear
sir
said
pickwick
with
some
embarrassment
i
had
no
idea
of
your
accompanying
no
that
s
just
the
very
thing
replied
bob
seizing
pickwick
by
the
lappel
of
his
coat
that
s
the
oh
that
s
the
joke
is
it
said
pickwick
of
course
replied
bob
it
s
the
whole
point
of
the
thing
you
know
that
and
leaving
the
business
to
take
care
of
itself
as
it
seems
to
have
made
up
its
mind
not
to
take
care
of
with
this
explanation
of
the
phenomenon
of
the
shutters
bob
sawyer
pointed
to
the
shop
and
relapsed
into
an
ecstasy
of
mirth
bless
me
you
are
surely
not
mad
enough
to
think
of
leaving
your
patients
without
anybody
to
attend
them
remonstrated
pickwick
in
a
very
serious
tone
why
not
asked
bob
in
reply
i
shall
save
by
it
you
know
none
of
them
ever
pay
besides
said
bob
lowering
his
voice
to
a
confidential
whisper
they
will
be
all
the
better
for
it
for
being
nearly
out
of
drugs
and
not
able
to
increase
my
account
just
now
i
should
have
been
obliged
to
give
them
calomel
all
round
and
it
would
have
been
certain
to
have
disagreed
with
some
of
them
so
it
s
all
for
the
there
was
a
philosophy
and
a
strength
of
reasoning
about
this
reply
which
pickwick
was
not
prepared
for
he
paused
a
few
moments
and
added
less
firmly
than
before
but
this
chaise
my
young
friend
will
only
hold
two
and
i
am
pledged
to
don
t
think
of
me
for
a
minute
replied
bob
i
ve
arranged
it
all
sam
and
i
will
share
the
dickey
between
us
look
here
this
little
bill
is
to
be
wafered
on
the
shop
door
sawyer
late
nockemorf
inquire
of
cripps
over
the
cripps
is
my
boy
s
mother
mr
sawyer
s
very
sorry
says
cripps
couldn
t
help
it
fetched
away
early
this
morning
to
a
consultation
of
the
very
first
surgeons
in
the
country
couldn
t
do
without
him
would
have
him
at
any
price
tremendous
the
fact
is
said
bob
in
conclusion
it
ll
do
me
more
good
than
otherwise
i
expect
if
it
gets
into
one
of
the
local
papers
it
will
be
the
making
of
me
here
s
ben
now
then
jump
in
with
these
hurried
words
bob
sawyer
pushed
the
postboy
on
one
side
jerked
his
friend
into
the
vehicle
slammed
the
door
put
up
the
steps
wafered
the
bill
on
the
street
door
locked
it
put
the
key
in
his
pocket
jumped
into
the
dickey
gave
the
word
for
starting
and
did
the
whole
with
such
extraordinary
precipitation
that
before
pickwick
had
well
begun
to
consider
whether
bob
sawyer
ought
to
go
or
not
they
were
rolling
away
with
bob
sawyer
thoroughly
established
as
part
and
parcel
of
the
equipage
so
long
as
their
progress
was
confined
to
the
streets
of
bristol
the
facetious
bob
kept
his
professional
green
spectacles
on
and
conducted
himself
with
becoming
steadiness
and
gravity
of
demeanour
merely
giving
utterance
to
divers
verbal
witticisms
for
the
exclusive
behoof
and
entertainment
of
samuel
weller
but
when
they
emerged
on
the
open
road
he
threw
off
his
green
spectacles
and
his
gravity
together
and
performed
a
great
variety
of
practical
jokes
which
were
calculated
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
passersby
and
to
render
the
carriage
and
those
it
contained
objects
of
more
than
ordinary
curiosity
the
least
conspicuous
among
these
feats
being
a
most
vociferous
imitation
of
a
and
the
ostentatious
display
of
a
crimson
silk
handkerchief
attached
to
a
which
was
occasionally
waved
in
the
air
with
various
gestures
indicative
of
supremacy
and
defiance
i
wonder
said
pickwick
stopping
in
the
midst
of
a
most
sedate
conversation
with
ben
allen
bearing
reference
to
the
numerous
good
qualities
of
winkle
and
his
sister
i
wonder
what
all
the
people
we
pass
can
see
in
us
to
make
them
stare
it
s
a
neat
replied
ben
allen
with
something
of
pride
in
his
tone
they
re
not
used
to
see
this
sort
of
thing
every
day
i
dare
possibly
replied
pickwick
it
may
be
so
perhaps
it
pickwick
might
very
probably
have
reasoned
himself
into
the
belief
that
it
really
was
had
he
not
just
then
happening
to
look
out
of
the
coach
window
observed
that
the
looks
of
the
passengers
betokened
anything
but
respectful
astonishment
and
that
various
telegraphic
communications
appeared
to
be
passing
between
them
and
some
persons
outside
the
vehicle
whereupon
it
occurred
to
him
that
these
demonstrations
might
be
in
some
remote
degree
referable
to
the
humorous
deportment
of
robert
sawyer
i
hope
said
pickwick
that
our
volatile
friend
is
committing
no
absurdities
in
that
dickey
oh
dear
no
replied
ben
allen
except
when
he
s
elevated
bob
s
the
quietest
creature
here
a
prolonged
imitation
of
a
broke
upon
the
ear
succeeded
by
cheers
and
screams
all
of
which
evidently
proceeded
from
the
throat
and
lungs
of
the
quietest
creature
breathing
or
in
plainer
designation
of
bob
sawyer
himself
pickwick
and
ben
allen
looked
expressively
at
each
other
and
the
former
gentleman
taking
off
his
hat
and
leaning
out
of
the
coach
window
until
nearly
the
whole
of
his
waistcoat
was
outside
it
was
at
length
enabled
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
his
facetious
friend
bob
sawyer
was
seated
not
in
the
dickey
but
on
the
roof
of
the
chaise
with
his
legs
as
far
asunder
as
they
would
conveniently
go
wearing
samuel
weller
s
hat
on
one
side
of
his
head
and
bearing
in
one
hand
a
most
enormous
sandwich
while
in
the
other
he
supported
a
to
both
of
which
he
applied
himself
with
intense
relish
varying
the
monotony
of
the
occupation
by
an
occasional
howl
or
the
interchange
of
some
lively
badinage
with
any
passing
stranger
the
crimson
flag
was
carefully
tied
in
an
erect
position
to
the
rail
of
the
dickey
and
samuel
weller
decorated
with
bob
sawyer
s
hat
was
seated
in
the
centre
thereof
discussing
a
twin
sandwich
with
an
animated
countenance
the
expression
of
which
betokened
his
entire
and
perfect
approval
of
the
whole
arrangement
this
was
enough
to
irritate
a
gentleman
with
pickwick
s
sense
of
propriety
but
it
was
not
the
whole
extent
of
the
aggravation
for
a
full
inside
and
out
was
meeting
them
at
the
moment
and
the
astonishment
of
the
passengers
was
very
palpably
evinced
the
congratulations
of
an
irish
family
too
who
were
keeping
up
with
the
chaise
and
begging
all
the
time
were
of
rather
a
boisterous
description
especially
those
of
its
male
head
who
appeared
to
consider
the
display
as
part
and
parcel
of
some
political
or
other
procession
of
triumph
mr
sawyer
cried
pickwick
in
a
state
of
great
excitement
mr
sawyer
sir
hollo
responded
that
gentleman
looking
over
the
side
of
the
chaise
with
all
the
coolness
in
life
are
you
mad
sir
demanded
pickwick
not
a
bit
of
it
replied
bob
only
cheerful
sir
ejaculated
pickwick
take
down
that
scandalous
red
handkerchief
i
beg
i
insist
sir
sam
take
it
before
sam
could
interpose
bob
sawyer
gracefully
struck
his
colours
and
having
put
them
in
his
pocket
nodded
in
a
courteous
manner
to
pickwick
wiped
the
mouth
of
the
and
applied
it
to
his
own
thereby
informing
him
without
any
unnecessary
waste
of
words
that
he
devoted
that
draught
to
wishing
him
all
manner
of
happiness
and
prosperity
having
done
this
bob
replaced
the
cork
with
great
care
and
looking
benignantly
down
on
pickwick
took
a
large
bite
out
of
the
sandwich
and
smiled
come
said
pickwick
whose
momentary
anger
was
not
quite
proof
against
bob
s
immovable
pray
let
us
have
no
more
of
this
no
no
replied
bob
once
more
exchanging
hats
with
weller
i
didn
t
mean
to
do
it
only
i
got
so
enlivened
with
the
ride
that
i
couldn
t
help
think
of
the
look
of
the
thing
expostulated
pickwick
have
some
regard
to
oh
certainly
said
bob
it
s
not
the
sort
of
thing
at
all
all
over
satisfied
with
this
assurance
pickwick
once
more
drew
his
head
into
the
chaise
and
pulled
up
the
glass
but
he
had
scarcely
resumed
the
conversation
which
bob
sawyer
had
interrupted
when
he
was
somewhat
startled
by
the
apparition
of
a
small
dark
body
of
an
oblong
form
on
the
outside
of
the
window
which
gave
sundry
taps
against
it
as
if
impatient
of
admission
what
s
this
exclaimed
pickwick
it
looks
like
a
remarked
ben
allen
eyeing
the
object
in
question
through
his
spectacles
with
some
interest
i
rather
think
it
belongs
to
the
impression
was
perfectly
accurate
for
bob
sawyer
having
attached
the
to
the
end
of
the
was
battering
the
window
with
it
in
token
of
his
wish
that
his
friends
inside
would
partake
of
its
contents
in
all
and
harmony
what
s
to
be
done
said
pickwick
looking
at
the
bottle
this
proceeding
is
more
absurd
than
the
i
think
it
would
be
best
to
take
it
in
replied
ben
allen
it
would
serve
him
right
to
take
it
in
and
keep
it
wouldn
t
it
it
would
said
pickwick
shall
i
i
think
it
the
most
proper
course
we
could
possibly
adopt
replied
ben
this
advice
quite
coinciding
with
his
own
opinion
pickwick
gently
let
down
the
window
and
disengaged
the
bottle
from
the
stick
upon
which
the
latter
was
drawn
up
and
bob
sawyer
was
heard
to
laugh
heartily
what
a
merry
dog
it
is
said
pickwick
looking
round
at
his
companion
with
the
bottle
in
his
hand
he
is
said
allen
you
can
not
possibly
be
angry
with
him
remarked
pickwick
quite
out
of
the
question
observed
benjamin
allen
during
this
short
interchange
of
sentiments
pickwick
had
in
an
abstracted
mood
uncorked
the
bottle
what
is
it
inquired
ben
allen
carelessly
i
don
t
know
replied
pickwick
with
equal
carelessness
it
smells
i
think
like
oh
indeed
said
ben
i
rejoined
pickwick
very
properly
guarding
himself
against
the
possibility
of
stating
an
untruth
mind
i
could
not
undertake
to
say
certainly
without
tasting
you
had
better
do
so
said
ben
we
may
as
well
know
what
it
do
you
think
so
replied
pickwick
well
if
you
are
curious
to
know
of
course
i
have
no
ever
willing
to
sacrifice
his
own
feelings
to
the
wishes
of
his
friend
pickwick
at
once
took
a
pretty
long
taste
what
is
it
inquired
ben
allen
interrupting
him
with
some
impatience
curious
said
pickwick
smacking
his
lips
i
hardly
know
now
oh
yes
said
pickwick
after
a
second
taste
it
ben
allen
looked
at
pickwick
pickwick
looked
at
ben
allen
ben
allen
smiled
pickwick
did
not
it
would
serve
him
right
said
the
gentleman
with
some
severity
it
would
serve
him
right
to
drink
it
every
the
very
thing
that
occurred
to
me
said
ben
allen
is
it
indeed
rejoined
pickwick
then
here
s
his
health
with
these
words
that
excellent
person
took
a
most
energetic
pull
at
the
bottle
and
handed
it
to
ben
allen
who
was
not
slow
to
imitate
his
example
the
smiles
became
mutual
and
the
was
gradually
and
cheerfully
disposed
of
after
all
said
pickwick
as
he
drained
the
last
drop
his
pranks
are
really
very
amusing
very
entertaining
you
may
say
that
rejoined
ben
allen
in
proof
of
bob
sawyer
s
being
one
of
the
funniest
fellows
alive
he
proceeded
to
entertain
pickwick
with
a
long
and
circumstantial
account
how
that
gentleman
once
drank
himself
into
a
fever
and
got
his
head
shaved
the
relation
of
which
pleasant
and
agreeable
history
was
only
stopped
by
the
stoppage
of
the
chaise
at
the
bell
at
berkeley
heath
to
change
horses
i
say
we
re
going
to
dine
here
aren
t
we
said
bob
looking
in
at
the
window
dine
said
pickwick
why
we
have
only
come
nineteen
miles
and
have
and
a
half
to
just
the
reason
why
we
should
take
something
to
enable
us
to
bear
up
against
the
fatigue
remonstrated
bob
sawyer
oh
it
s
quite
impossible
to
dine
at
eleven
o
clock
in
the
day
replied
pickwick
looking
at
his
watch
so
it
is
rejoined
bob
lunch
is
the
very
thing
hollo
you
sir
lunch
for
three
directly
and
keep
the
horses
back
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
tell
them
to
put
everything
they
have
cold
on
the
table
and
some
bottled
ale
and
let
us
taste
your
very
best
issuing
these
orders
with
monstrous
importance
and
bustle
bob
sawyer
at
once
hurried
into
the
house
to
superintend
the
arrangements
in
less
than
five
minutes
he
returned
and
declared
them
to
be
excellent
the
quality
of
the
lunch
fully
justified
the
eulogium
which
bob
had
pronounced
and
very
great
justice
was
done
to
it
not
only
by
that
gentleman
but
ben
allen
and
pickwick
also
under
the
auspices
of
the
three
the
bottled
ale
and
the
madeira
were
promptly
disposed
of
and
when
the
horses
being
once
more
put
to
they
resumed
their
seats
with
the
full
of
the
best
substitute
for
that
could
be
procured
on
so
short
a
notice
the
sounded
and
the
red
flag
waved
without
the
slightest
opposition
on
pickwick
s
part
at
the
hop
pole
at
tewkesbury
they
stopped
to
dine
upon
which
occasion
there
was
more
bottled
ale
with
some
more
madeira
and
some
port
besides
and
here
the
was
replenished
for
the
fourth
time
under
the
influence
of
these
combined
stimulants
pickwick
and
ben
allen
fell
fast
asleep
for
thirty
miles
while
bob
and
weller
sang
duets
in
the
dickey
it
was
quite
dark
when
pickwick
roused
himself
sufficiently
to
look
out
of
the
window
the
straggling
cottages
by
the
the
dingy
hue
of
every
object
visible
the
murky
atmosphere
the
paths
of
cinders
and
the
glow
of
furnace
fires
in
the
distance
the
volumes
of
dense
smoke
issuing
heavily
forth
from
high
toppling
chimneys
blackening
and
obscuring
everything
around
the
glare
of
distant
lights
the
ponderous
wagons
which
toiled
along
the
road
laden
with
clashing
rods
of
iron
or
piled
with
heavy
goods
all
betokened
their
rapid
approach
to
the
great
working
town
of
birmingham
as
they
rattled
through
the
narrow
thoroughfares
leading
to
the
heart
of
the
turmoil
the
sights
and
sounds
of
earnest
occupation
struck
more
forcibly
on
the
senses
the
streets
were
thronged
with
working
people
the
hum
of
labour
resounded
from
every
house
lights
gleamed
from
the
long
casement
windows
in
the
attic
storeys
and
the
whirl
of
wheels
and
noise
of
machinery
shook
the
trembling
walls
the
fires
whose
lurid
sullen
light
had
been
visible
for
miles
blazed
fiercely
up
in
the
great
works
and
factories
of
the
town
the
din
of
hammers
the
rushing
of
steam
and
the
dead
heavy
clanking
of
engines
was
the
harsh
music
which
arose
from
every
quarter
the
postboy
was
driving
briskly
through
the
open
streets
and
past
the
handsome
and
shops
that
intervene
between
the
outskirts
of
the
town
and
the
old
royal
hotel
before
pickwick
had
begun
to
consider
the
very
difficult
and
delicate
nature
of
the
commission
which
had
carried
him
thither
the
delicate
nature
of
this
commission
and
the
difficulty
of
executing
it
in
a
satisfactory
manner
were
by
no
means
lessened
by
the
voluntary
companionship
of
bob
sawyer
truth
to
tell
pickwick
felt
that
his
presence
on
the
occasion
however
considerate
and
gratifying
was
by
no
means
an
honour
he
would
willingly
have
sought
in
fact
he
would
cheerfully
have
given
a
reasonable
sum
of
money
to
have
had
bob
sawyer
removed
to
any
place
at
not
less
than
fifty
miles
distance
without
delay
pickwick
had
never
held
any
personal
communication
with
winkle
senior
although
he
had
once
or
twice
corresponded
with
him
by
letter
and
returned
satisfactory
answers
to
his
inquiries
concerning
the
moral
character
and
behaviour
of
his
son
he
felt
nervously
sensible
that
to
wait
upon
him
for
the
first
time
attended
by
bob
sawyer
and
ben
allen
both
slightly
fuddled
was
not
the
most
ingenious
and
likely
means
that
could
have
been
hit
upon
to
prepossess
him
in
his
favour
however
said
pickwick
endeavouring
to
reassure
himself
i
must
do
the
best
i
can
i
must
see
him
for
i
faithfully
promised
to
do
so
if
they
persist
in
accompanying
me
i
must
make
the
interview
as
brief
as
possible
and
be
content
that
for
their
own
sakes
they
will
not
expose
as
he
comforted
himself
with
these
reflections
the
chaise
stopped
at
the
door
of
the
old
royal
ben
allen
having
been
partially
awakened
from
a
stupendous
sleep
and
dragged
out
by
the
collar
by
samuel
weller
pickwick
was
enabled
to
alight
they
were
shown
to
a
comfortable
apartment
and
pickwick
at
once
propounded
a
question
to
the
waiter
concerning
the
whereabout
of
winkle
s
residence
close
by
sir
said
the
waiter
not
above
five
hundred
yards
sir
winkle
is
a
wharfinger
sir
at
the
canal
sir
private
residence
is
not
oh
dear
no
sir
not
five
hundred
yards
here
the
waiter
blew
a
candle
out
and
made
a
feint
of
lighting
it
again
in
order
to
afford
pickwick
an
opportunity
of
asking
any
further
questions
if
he
felt
so
disposed
take
anything
now
sir
said
the
waiter
lighting
the
candle
in
desperation
at
pickwick
s
silence
tea
or
coffee
sir
dinner
sir
nothing
very
good
sir
like
to
order
supper
sir
not
just
very
good
here
he
walked
slowly
to
the
door
and
then
stopping
short
turned
round
and
said
with
great
suavity
shall
i
send
the
chambermaid
gentlemen
you
may
if
you
please
replied
pickwick
if
and
bring
some
said
bob
sawyer
sir
yes
with
his
mind
apparently
relieved
from
an
overwhelming
weight
by
having
at
last
got
an
order
for
something
the
waiter
imperceptibly
melted
away
waiters
never
walk
or
run
they
have
a
peculiar
and
mysterious
power
of
skimming
out
of
rooms
which
other
mortals
possess
not
some
slight
symptoms
of
vitality
having
been
awakened
in
ben
allen
by
the
he
suffered
himself
to
be
prevailed
upon
to
wash
his
face
and
hands
and
to
submit
to
be
brushed
by
sam
pickwick
and
bob
sawyer
having
also
repaired
the
disorder
which
the
journey
had
made
in
their
apparel
the
three
started
forth
arm
in
arm
to
winkle
s
bob
sawyer
impregnating
the
atmosphere
with
tobacco
smoke
as
he
walked
along
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
off
in
a
quiet
street
stood
an
old
red
brick
house
with
three
steps
before
the
door
and
a
brass
plate
upon
it
bearing
in
fat
roman
capitals
the
words
mr
the
steps
were
very
white
and
the
bricks
were
very
red
and
the
house
was
very
clean
and
here
stood
pickwick
benjamin
allen
and
bob
sawyer
as
the
clock
struck
ten
a
smart
answered
the
knock
and
started
on
beholding
the
three
strangers
is
winkle
at
home
my
dear
inquired
pickwick
he
is
just
going
to
supper
sir
replied
the
girl
give
him
that
card
if
you
please
rejoined
pickwick
say
i
am
sorry
to
trouble
him
at
so
late
an
hour
but
i
am
anxious
to
see
him
night
and
have
only
just
the
girl
looked
timidly
at
bob
sawyer
who
was
expressing
his
admiration
of
her
personal
charms
by
a
variety
of
wonderful
grimaces
and
casting
an
eye
at
the
hats
and
greatcoats
which
hung
in
the
passage
called
another
girl
to
mind
the
door
while
she
went
upstairs
the
sentinel
was
speedily
relieved
for
the
girl
returned
immediately
and
begging
pardon
of
the
gentlemen
for
leaving
them
in
the
street
ushered
them
into
a
back
parlour
half
office
and
half
dressing
room
in
which
the
principal
useful
and
ornamental
articles
of
furniture
were
a
desk
a
stand
and
a
and
jack
a
high
stool
four
chairs
a
table
and
an
old
clock
over
the
mantelpiece
were
the
sunken
doors
of
an
iron
safe
while
a
couple
of
hanging
shelves
for
books
an
almanac
and
several
files
of
dusty
papers
decorated
the
walls
very
sorry
to
leave
you
standing
at
the
door
sir
said
the
girl
lighting
a
lamp
and
addressing
pickwick
with
a
winning
smile
but
you
was
quite
strangers
to
me
and
we
have
such
a
many
trampers
that
only
come
to
see
what
they
can
lay
their
hands
on
that
really
there
is
not
the
least
occasion
for
any
apology
my
dear
said
pickwick
not
the
slightest
my
love
said
bob
sawyer
playfully
stretching
forth
his
arms
and
skipping
from
side
to
side
as
if
to
prevent
the
young
lady
s
leaving
the
room
the
young
lady
was
not
at
all
softened
by
these
allurements
for
she
at
once
expressed
her
opinion
that
bob
sawyer
was
an
odous
creetur
and
on
his
becoming
rather
more
pressing
in
his
attentions
imprinted
her
fair
fingers
upon
his
face
and
bounced
out
of
the
room
with
many
expressions
of
aversion
and
contempt
deprived
of
the
young
lady
s
society
bob
sawyer
proceeded
to
divert
himself
by
peeping
into
the
desk
looking
into
all
the
table
drawers
feigning
to
pick
the
lock
of
the
iron
safe
turning
the
almanac
with
its
face
to
the
wall
trying
on
the
boots
of
winkle
senior
over
his
own
and
making
several
other
humorous
experiments
upon
the
furniture
all
of
which
afforded
pickwick
unspeakable
horror
and
agony
and
yielded
bob
sawyer
proportionate
delight
at
length
the
door
opened
and
a
little
old
gentleman
in
a
coloured
suit
with
a
head
and
face
the
precise
counterpart
of
those
belonging
to
winkle
junior
excepting
that
he
was
rather
bald
trotted
into
the
room
with
pickwick
s
card
in
one
hand
and
a
silver
candlestick
in
the
other
mr
pickwick
sir
how
do
you
do
said
winkle
the
elder
putting
down
the
candlestick
and
proffering
his
hand
hope
i
see
you
well
sir
glad
to
see
you
be
seated
pickwick
i
beg
sir
this
gentleman
is
my
friend
sawyer
interposed
pickwick
your
son
s
oh
said
winkle
the
elder
looking
rather
grimly
at
bob
i
hope
you
are
well
right
as
a
trivet
sir
replied
bob
sawyer
this
other
gentleman
cried
pickwick
is
as
you
will
see
when
you
have
read
the
letter
with
which
i
am
intrusted
a
very
near
relative
or
i
should
rather
say
a
very
particular
friend
of
your
son
s
his
name
is
inquired
winkle
pointing
with
the
card
towards
ben
allen
who
had
fallen
asleep
in
an
attitude
which
left
nothing
of
him
visible
but
his
spine
and
his
coat
collar
pickwick
was
on
the
point
of
replying
to
the
question
and
reciting
benjamin
allen
s
name
and
honourable
distinctions
at
full
length
when
the
sprightly
bob
sawyer
with
a
view
of
rousing
his
friend
to
a
sense
of
his
situation
inflicted
a
startling
pinch
upon
the
fleshly
part
of
his
arm
which
caused
him
to
jump
up
with
a
shriek
suddenly
aware
that
he
was
in
the
presence
of
a
stranger
ben
allen
advanced
and
shaking
winkle
most
affectionately
by
both
hands
for
about
five
minutes
murmured
in
some
fragments
of
sentences
the
great
delight
he
felt
in
seeing
him
and
a
hospitable
inquiry
whether
he
felt
disposed
to
take
anything
after
his
walk
or
would
prefer
waiting
till
which
done
he
sat
down
and
gazed
about
him
with
a
petrified
stare
as
if
he
had
not
the
remotest
idea
where
he
was
which
indeed
he
had
not
all
this
was
most
embarrassing
to
pickwick
the
more
especially
as
winkle
senior
evinced
palpable
astonishment
at
the
eccentric
not
to
say
extraordinary
behaviour
of
his
two
companions
to
bring
the
matter
to
an
issue
at
once
he
drew
a
letter
from
his
pocket
and
presenting
it
to
winkle
senior
said
this
letter
sir
is
from
your
son
you
will
see
by
its
contents
that
on
your
favourable
and
fatherly
consideration
of
it
depend
his
future
happiness
and
welfare
will
you
oblige
me
by
giving
it
the
calmest
and
coolest
perusal
and
by
discussing
the
subject
afterwards
with
me
in
the
tone
and
spirit
in
which
alone
it
ought
to
be
discussed
you
may
judge
of
the
importance
of
your
decision
to
your
son
and
his
intense
anxiety
upon
the
subject
by
my
waiting
upon
you
without
any
previous
warning
at
so
late
an
hour
and
added
pickwick
glancing
slightly
at
his
two
companions
and
under
such
unfavourable
with
this
prelude
pickwick
placed
four
sides
of
extra
superfine
penitence
in
the
hands
of
the
astounded
winkle
senior
then
reseating
himself
in
his
chair
he
watched
his
looks
and
manner
anxiously
it
is
true
but
with
the
open
front
of
a
gentleman
who
feels
he
has
taken
no
part
which
he
need
excuse
or
palliate
the
old
wharfinger
turned
the
letter
over
looked
at
the
front
back
and
sides
made
a
microscopic
examination
of
the
fat
little
boy
on
the
seal
raised
his
eyes
to
pickwick
s
face
and
then
seating
himself
on
the
high
stool
and
drawing
the
lamp
closer
to
him
broke
the
wax
unfolded
the
epistle
and
lifting
it
to
the
light
prepared
to
read
just
at
this
moment
bob
sawyer
whose
wit
had
lain
dormant
for
some
minutes
placed
his
hands
on
his
knees
and
made
a
face
after
the
portraits
of
the
late
grimaldi
as
clown
it
so
happened
that
winkle
senior
instead
of
being
deeply
engaged
in
reading
the
letter
as
bob
sawyer
thought
chanced
to
be
looking
over
the
top
of
it
at
no
less
a
person
than
bob
sawyer
himself
rightly
conjecturing
that
the
face
aforesaid
was
made
in
ridicule
and
derision
of
his
own
person
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
bob
with
such
expressive
sternness
that
the
late
grimaldi
s
lineaments
gradually
resolved
themselves
into
a
very
fine
expression
of
humility
and
confusion
did
you
speak
sir
inquired
winkle
senior
after
an
awful
silence
no
sir
replied
bob
with
no
remains
of
the
clown
about
him
save
and
except
the
extreme
redness
of
his
cheeks
you
are
sure
you
did
not
sir
said
winkle
senior
oh
dear
yes
sir
quite
replied
bob
i
thought
you
did
sir
replied
the
old
gentleman
with
indignant
emphasis
perhaps
you
me
sir
oh
no
sir
not
at
all
replied
bob
with
extreme
civility
i
am
very
glad
to
hear
it
sir
said
winkle
senior
having
frowned
upon
the
abashed
bob
with
great
magnificence
the
old
gentleman
again
brought
the
letter
to
the
light
and
began
to
read
it
seriously
pickwick
eyed
him
intently
as
he
turned
from
the
bottom
line
of
the
first
page
to
the
top
line
of
the
second
and
from
the
bottom
of
the
second
to
the
top
of
the
third
and
from
the
bottom
of
the
third
to
the
top
of
the
fourth
but
not
the
slightest
alteration
of
countenance
afforded
a
clue
to
the
feelings
with
which
he
received
the
announcement
of
his
son
s
marriage
which
pickwick
knew
was
in
the
very
first
lines
he
read
the
letter
to
the
last
word
folded
it
again
with
all
the
carefulness
and
precision
of
a
man
of
business
and
just
when
pickwick
expected
some
great
outbreak
of
feeling
dipped
a
pen
in
the
and
said
as
quietly
as
if
he
were
speaking
on
the
most
ordinary
topic
what
is
nathaniel
s
address
pickwick
the
george
and
vulture
at
present
replied
that
gentleman
george
and
vulture
where
is
that
george
yard
lombard
in
the
city
the
old
gentleman
methodically
indorsed
the
address
on
the
back
of
the
letter
and
then
placing
it
in
the
desk
which
he
locked
said
as
he
got
off
the
stool
and
put
the
bunch
of
keys
in
his
pocket
i
suppose
there
is
nothing
else
which
need
detain
us
pickwick
nothing
else
my
dear
sir
observed
that
person
in
indignant
amazement
nothing
else
have
you
no
opinion
to
express
on
this
momentous
event
in
our
young
friend
s
life
no
assurance
to
convey
to
him
through
me
of
the
continuance
of
your
affection
and
protection
nothing
to
say
which
will
cheer
and
sustain
him
and
the
anxious
girl
who
looks
to
him
for
comfort
and
support
my
dear
sir
i
will
consider
replied
the
old
gentleman
i
have
nothing
to
say
just
now
i
am
a
man
of
business
pickwick
i
never
commit
myself
hastily
in
any
affair
and
from
what
i
see
of
this
i
by
no
means
like
the
appearance
of
it
a
thousand
pounds
is
not
much
you
re
very
right
sir
interposed
ben
allen
just
awake
enough
to
know
that
he
had
spent
his
thousand
pounds
without
the
smallest
difficulty
you
re
an
intelligent
man
bob
he
s
a
very
knowing
fellow
i
am
very
happy
to
find
that
you
do
me
the
justice
to
make
the
admission
sir
said
winkle
senior
looking
contemptuously
at
ben
allen
who
was
shaking
his
head
profoundly
the
fact
is
pickwick
that
when
i
gave
my
son
a
roving
license
for
a
year
or
so
to
see
something
of
men
and
manners
which
he
has
done
under
your
auspices
so
that
he
might
not
enter
life
a
mere
to
be
gulled
by
everybody
i
never
bargained
for
this
he
knows
that
very
well
so
if
i
withdraw
my
countenance
from
him
on
this
account
he
has
no
call
to
be
surprised
he
shall
hear
from
me
pickwick
night
margaret
open
the
all
this
time
bob
sawyer
had
been
nudging
ben
allen
to
say
something
on
the
right
side
ben
accordingly
now
burst
without
the
slightest
preliminary
notice
into
a
brief
but
impassioned
piece
of
eloquence
sir
said
ben
allen
staring
at
the
old
gentleman
out
of
a
pair
of
very
dim
and
languid
eyes
and
working
his
right
arm
vehemently
up
and
down
you
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
as
the
lady
s
brother
of
course
you
are
an
excellent
judge
of
the
question
retorted
winkle
senior
there
that
s
enough
pray
say
no
more
pickwick
gentlemen
with
these
words
the
old
gentleman
took
up
the
and
opening
the
room
door
politely
motioned
towards
the
passage
you
will
regret
this
sir
said
pickwick
setting
his
teeth
close
together
to
keep
down
his
choler
for
he
felt
how
important
the
effect
might
prove
to
his
young
friend
i
am
at
present
of
a
different
opinion
calmly
replied
winkle
senior
once
again
gentlemen
i
wish
you
a
pickwick
walked
with
angry
strides
into
the
street
bob
sawyer
completely
quelled
by
the
decision
of
the
old
gentleman
s
manner
took
the
same
course
ben
allen
s
hat
rolled
down
the
steps
immediately
afterwards
and
ben
allen
s
body
followed
it
directly
the
whole
party
went
silent
and
supperless
to
bed
and
pickwick
thought
just
before
he
fell
asleep
that
if
he
had
known
winkle
senior
had
been
quite
so
much
of
a
man
of
business
it
was
extremely
probable
he
might
never
have
waited
upon
him
on
such
an
errand
chapter
li
in
which
pickwick
encounters
an
old
acquaintance
to
which
fortunate
circumstance
the
reader
is
mainly
indebted
for
matter
of
thrilling
interest
herein
set
down
concerning
two
great
public
men
of
might
and
power
the
morning
which
broke
upon
pickwick
s
sight
at
eight
o
clock
was
not
at
all
calculated
to
elevate
his
spirits
or
to
lessen
the
depression
which
the
result
of
his
embassy
inspired
the
sky
was
dark
and
gloomy
the
air
was
damp
and
raw
the
streets
were
wet
and
sloppy
the
smoke
hung
sluggishly
above
the
as
if
it
lacked
the
courage
to
rise
and
the
rain
came
slowly
and
doggedly
down
as
if
it
had
not
even
the
spirit
to
pour
a
in
the
stableyard
deprived
of
every
spark
of
his
accustomed
animation
balanced
himself
dismally
on
one
leg
in
a
corner
a
donkey
moping
with
drooping
head
under
the
narrow
roof
of
an
outhouse
appeared
from
his
meditative
and
miserable
countenance
to
be
contemplating
suicide
in
the
street
umbrellas
were
the
only
things
to
be
seen
and
the
clicking
of
pattens
and
splashing
of
were
the
only
sounds
to
be
heard
the
breakfast
was
interrupted
by
very
little
conversation
even
bob
sawyer
felt
the
influence
of
the
weather
and
the
previous
day
s
excitement
in
his
own
expressive
language
he
was
so
was
ben
allen
so
was
pickwick
in
protracted
expectation
of
the
weather
clearing
up
the
last
evening
paper
from
london
was
read
and
with
an
intensity
of
interest
only
known
in
cases
of
extreme
destitution
every
inch
of
the
carpet
was
walked
over
with
similar
perseverance
the
windows
were
looked
out
of
often
enough
to
justify
the
imposition
of
an
additional
duty
upon
them
all
kinds
of
topics
of
conversation
were
started
and
failed
and
at
length
pickwick
when
noon
had
arrived
without
a
change
for
the
better
rang
the
bell
resolutely
and
ordered
out
the
chaise
although
the
roads
were
miry
and
the
drizzling
rain
came
down
harder
than
it
had
done
yet
and
although
the
mud
and
wet
splashed
in
at
the
open
windows
of
the
carriage
to
such
an
extent
that
the
discomfort
was
almost
as
great
to
the
pair
of
insides
as
to
the
pair
of
outsides
still
there
was
something
in
the
motion
and
the
sense
of
being
up
and
doing
which
was
so
infinitely
superior
to
being
pent
in
a
dull
room
looking
at
the
dull
rain
dripping
into
a
dull
street
that
they
all
agreed
on
starting
that
the
change
was
a
great
improvement
and
wondered
how
they
could
possibly
have
delayed
making
it
as
long
as
they
had
done
when
they
stopped
to
change
at
coventry
the
steam
ascended
from
the
horses
in
such
clouds
as
wholly
to
obscure
the
hostler
whose
voice
was
however
heard
to
declare
from
the
mist
that
he
expected
the
first
gold
medal
from
the
humane
society
on
their
next
distribution
of
rewards
for
taking
the
postboy
s
hat
off
the
water
descending
from
the
brim
of
which
the
invisible
gentleman
declared
must
have
drowned
him
the
postboy
but
for
his
great
presence
of
mind
in
tearing
it
promptly
from
his
head
and
drying
the
gasping
man
s
countenance
with
a
wisp
of
straw
this
is
pleasant
said
bob
sawyer
turning
up
his
coat
collar
and
pulling
the
shawl
over
his
mouth
to
concentrate
the
fumes
of
a
glass
of
brandy
just
swallowed
wery
replied
sam
composedly
you
don
t
seem
to
mind
it
observed
bob
vy
i
don
t
exactly
see
no
good
my
mindin
on
it
ud
do
sir
replied
sam
that
s
an
unanswerable
reason
anyhow
said
bob
yes
sir
rejoined
weller
wotever
is
is
right
as
the
young
nobleman
sweetly
remarked
wen
they
put
him
down
in
the
pension
list
cos
his
mother
s
uncle
s
vife
s
grandfather
vunce
lit
the
king
s
pipe
vith
a
portable
not
a
bad
notion
that
sam
said
bob
sawyer
approvingly
just
wot
the
young
nobleman
said
ev
ry
arterwards
for
the
rest
of
his
life
replied
weller
wos
you
ever
called
in
inquired
sam
glancing
at
the
driver
after
a
short
silence
and
lowering
his
voice
to
a
mysterious
whisper
wos
you
ever
called
in
when
you
wos
prentice
to
a
sawbones
to
wisit
a
i
don
t
remember
that
i
ever
was
replied
bob
sawyer
you
never
see
a
postboy
in
that
ere
hospital
as
you
as
they
says
o
the
ghosts
did
you
demanded
sam
no
replied
bob
sawyer
i
don
t
think
i
ever
never
know
d
a
churchyard
were
there
wos
a
postboy
s
tombstone
or
see
a
dead
postboy
did
you
inquired
sam
pursuing
his
catechism
no
rejoined
bob
i
never
no
rejoined
sam
triumphantly
nor
never
vill
and
there
s
another
thing
that
no
man
never
see
and
that
s
a
dead
donkey
no
man
never
see
a
dead
donkey
cept
the
gen
l
m
n
in
the
black
silk
smalls
as
know
d
the
young
ooman
as
kep
a
goat
and
that
wos
a
french
donkey
so
wery
likely
he
warn
t
wun
o
the
reg
lar
well
what
has
that
got
to
do
with
the
postboys
asked
bob
sawyer
this
here
replied
sam
without
goin
so
far
as
to
as
some
wery
sensible
people
do
that
postboys
and
donkeys
is
both
immortal
wot
i
say
is
this
that
wenever
they
feels
theirselves
gettin
stiff
and
past
their
work
they
just
rides
off
together
wun
postboy
to
a
pair
in
the
usual
way
wot
becomes
on
em
nobody
knows
but
it
s
wery
probable
as
they
starts
avay
to
take
their
pleasure
in
some
other
vorld
for
there
ain
t
a
man
alive
as
ever
see
either
a
donkey
or
a
postboy
takin
his
pleasure
in
this
expatiating
upon
this
learned
and
remarkable
theory
and
citing
many
curious
statistical
and
other
facts
in
its
support
sam
weller
beguiled
the
time
until
they
reached
dunchurch
where
a
dry
postboy
and
fresh
horses
were
procured
the
next
stage
was
daventry
and
the
next
towcester
and
at
the
end
of
each
stage
it
rained
harder
than
it
had
done
at
the
beginning
i
say
remonstrated
bob
sawyer
looking
in
at
the
coach
window
as
they
pulled
up
before
the
door
of
the
saracen
s
head
towcester
this
won
t
do
you
bless
me
said
pickwick
just
awakening
from
a
nap
i
m
afraid
you
re
oh
you
are
are
you
returned
bob
yes
i
am
a
little
that
way
uncomfortably
damp
bob
did
look
dampish
inasmuch
as
the
rain
was
streaming
from
his
neck
elbows
cuffs
skirts
and
knees
and
his
whole
apparel
shone
so
with
the
wet
that
it
might
have
been
mistaken
for
a
full
suit
of
prepared
oilskin
i
rather
wet
said
bob
giving
himself
a
shake
and
casting
a
little
hydraulic
shower
around
like
a
newfoundland
dog
just
emerged
from
the
water
i
think
it
s
quite
impossible
to
go
on
interposed
ben
out
of
the
question
sir
remarked
sam
weller
coming
to
assist
in
the
conference
it
s
a
cruelty
to
animals
sir
to
ask
em
to
do
it
there
s
beds
here
sir
said
sam
addressing
his
master
everything
clean
and
comfortable
wery
good
little
dinner
sir
they
can
get
ready
in
half
an
hour
pair
of
fowls
sir
and
a
weal
cutlet
french
beans
taturs
tart
and
tidiness
you
d
better
stop
vere
you
are
sir
if
i
might
recommend
take
adwice
sir
as
the
doctor
the
host
of
the
saracen
s
head
opportunely
appeared
at
this
moment
to
confirm
weller
s
statement
relative
to
the
accommodations
of
the
establishment
and
to
back
his
entreaties
with
a
variety
of
dismal
conjectures
regarding
the
state
of
the
roads
the
doubt
of
fresh
horses
being
to
be
had
at
the
next
stage
the
dead
certainty
of
its
raining
all
night
the
equally
mortal
certainty
of
its
clearing
up
in
the
morning
and
other
topics
of
inducement
familiar
to
innkeepers
well
said
pickwick
but
i
must
send
a
letter
to
london
by
some
conveyance
so
that
it
may
be
delivered
the
very
first
thing
in
the
morning
or
i
must
go
forwards
at
all
the
landlord
smiled
his
delight
nothing
could
be
easier
than
for
the
gentleman
to
inclose
a
letter
in
a
sheet
of
brown
paper
and
send
it
on
either
by
the
mail
or
the
night
coach
from
birmingham
if
the
gentleman
were
particularly
anxious
to
have
it
left
as
soon
as
possible
he
might
write
outside
to
be
delivered
immediately
which
was
sure
to
be
attended
to
or
pay
the
bearer
extra
for
instant
delivery
which
was
surer
still
very
well
said
pickwick
then
we
will
stop
lights
in
the
sun
john
make
up
the
fire
the
gentlemen
are
wet
cried
the
landlord
this
way
gentlemen
don
t
trouble
yourselves
about
the
postboy
now
sir
i
ll
send
him
to
you
when
you
ring
for
him
sir
now
john
the
the
candles
were
brought
the
fire
was
stirred
up
and
a
fresh
log
of
wood
thrown
on
in
ten
minutes
time
a
waiter
was
laying
the
cloth
for
dinner
the
curtains
were
drawn
the
fire
was
blazing
brightly
and
everything
looked
as
everything
always
does
in
all
decent
english
inns
as
if
the
travellers
had
been
expected
and
their
comforts
prepared
for
days
beforehand
pickwick
sat
down
at
a
side
table
and
hastily
indited
a
note
to
winkle
merely
informing
him
that
he
was
detained
by
stress
of
weather
but
would
certainly
be
in
london
next
day
until
when
he
deferred
any
account
of
his
proceedings
this
note
was
hastily
made
into
a
parcel
and
despatched
to
the
bar
per
samuel
weller
sam
left
it
with
the
landlady
and
was
returning
to
pull
his
master
s
boots
off
after
drying
himself
by
the
kitchen
fire
when
glancing
casually
through
a
door
he
was
arrested
by
the
sight
of
a
gentleman
with
a
sandy
head
who
had
a
large
bundle
of
newspapers
lying
on
the
table
before
him
and
was
perusing
the
leading
article
of
one
with
a
settled
sneer
which
curled
up
his
nose
and
all
other
features
into
a
majestic
expression
of
haughty
contempt
hollo
said
sam
i
ought
to
know
that
ere
head
and
them
features
the
eyeglass
too
and
the
tile
eatansvill
to
vit
or
i
m
a
sam
was
taken
with
a
troublesome
cough
at
once
for
the
purpose
of
attracting
the
gentleman
s
attention
the
gentleman
starting
at
the
sound
raised
his
head
and
his
eyeglass
and
disclosed
to
view
the
profound
and
thoughtful
features
of
pott
of
the
eatanswill
beggin
your
pardon
sir
said
sam
advancing
with
a
bow
my
master
s
here
hush
hush
cried
pott
drawing
sam
into
the
room
and
closing
the
door
with
a
countenance
of
mysterious
dread
and
apprehension
wot
s
the
matter
sir
inquired
sam
looking
vacantly
about
him
not
a
whisper
of
my
name
replied
pott
this
is
a
buff
neighbourhood
if
the
excited
and
irritable
populace
knew
i
was
here
i
should
be
torn
to
no
vould
you
sir
inquired
sam
i
should
be
the
victim
of
their
fury
replied
pott
now
young
man
what
of
your
master
he
s
here
on
his
vay
to
town
with
a
couple
of
friends
replied
sam
is
winkle
one
of
them
inquired
pott
with
a
slight
frown
no
sir
vinkle
stops
at
home
now
rejoined
sam
he
s
married
exclaimed
pott
with
frightful
vehemence
he
stopped
smiled
darkly
and
added
in
a
low
vindictive
tone
it
serves
him
right
having
given
vent
to
this
cruel
ebullition
of
deadly
malice
and
blooded
triumph
over
a
fallen
enemy
pott
inquired
whether
pickwick
s
friends
were
blue
receiving
a
most
satisfactory
answer
in
the
affirmative
from
sam
who
knew
as
much
about
the
matter
as
pott
himself
he
consented
to
accompany
him
to
pickwick
s
room
where
a
hearty
welcome
awaited
him
and
an
agreement
to
club
their
dinners
together
was
at
once
made
and
ratified
and
how
are
matters
going
on
in
eatanswill
inquired
pickwick
when
pott
had
taken
a
seat
near
the
fire
and
the
whole
party
had
got
their
wet
boots
off
and
dry
slippers
on
is
the
still
in
being
the
sir
replied
pott
is
still
dragging
on
a
wretched
and
lingering
career
abhorred
and
despised
by
even
the
few
who
are
cognisant
of
its
miserable
and
disgraceful
existence
stifled
by
the
very
filth
it
so
profusely
scatters
rendered
deaf
and
blind
by
the
exhalations
of
its
own
slime
the
obscene
journal
happily
unconscious
of
its
degraded
state
is
rapidly
sinking
beneath
that
treacherous
mud
which
while
it
seems
to
give
it
a
firm
standing
with
the
low
and
debased
classes
of
society
is
nevertheless
rising
above
its
detested
head
and
will
speedily
engulf
it
for
having
delivered
this
manifesto
which
formed
a
portion
of
his
last
week
s
leader
with
vehement
articulation
the
editor
paused
to
take
breath
and
looked
majestically
at
bob
sawyer
you
are
a
young
man
sir
said
pott
bob
sawyer
nodded
so
are
you
sir
said
pott
addressing
ben
allen
ben
admitted
the
soft
impeachment
and
are
both
deeply
imbued
with
those
blue
principles
which
so
long
as
i
live
i
have
pledged
myself
to
the
people
of
these
kingdoms
to
support
and
to
maintain
suggested
pott
why
i
don
t
exactly
know
about
that
replied
bob
sawyer
i
am
not
buff
pickwick
interrupted
pott
drawing
back
his
chair
your
friend
is
not
buff
sir
no
no
rejoined
bob
i
m
a
kind
of
plaid
at
present
a
compound
of
all
sorts
of
a
waverer
said
pott
solemnly
a
waverer
i
should
like
to
show
you
a
series
of
eight
articles
sir
that
have
appeared
in
the
eatanswill
i
think
i
may
venture
to
say
that
you
would
not
be
long
in
establishing
your
opinions
on
a
firm
and
solid
blue
basis
i
dare
say
i
should
turn
very
blue
long
before
i
got
to
the
end
of
them
responded
bob
pott
looked
dubiously
at
bob
sawyer
for
some
seconds
and
turning
to
pickwick
said
you
have
seen
the
literary
articles
which
have
appeared
at
intervals
in
the
eatanswill
in
the
course
of
the
last
three
months
and
which
have
excited
such
general
i
may
say
such
universal
attention
and
admiration
why
replied
pickwick
slightly
embarrassed
by
the
question
the
fact
is
i
have
been
so
much
engaged
in
other
ways
that
i
really
have
not
had
an
opportunity
of
perusing
you
should
do
so
sir
said
pott
with
a
severe
countenance
i
will
said
pickwick
they
appeared
in
the
form
of
a
copious
review
of
a
work
on
chinese
metaphysics
sir
said
pott
oh
observed
pickwick
from
your
pen
i
hope
from
the
pen
of
my
critic
sir
rejoined
pott
with
dignity
an
abstruse
subject
i
should
conceive
said
pickwick
very
sir
responded
pott
looking
intensely
sage
he
it
to
use
a
technical
but
expressive
term
he
read
up
for
the
subject
at
my
desire
in
the
encyclopaedia
indeed
said
pickwick
i
was
not
aware
that
that
valuable
work
contained
any
information
respecting
chinese
he
read
sir
rejoined
pott
laying
his
hand
on
pickwick
s
knee
and
looking
round
with
a
smile
of
intellectual
superiority
he
read
for
metaphysics
under
the
letter
m
and
for
china
under
the
letter
c
and
combined
his
information
sir
pott
s
features
assumed
so
much
additional
grandeur
at
the
recollection
of
the
power
and
research
displayed
in
the
learned
effusions
in
question
that
some
minutes
elapsed
before
pickwick
felt
emboldened
to
renew
the
conversation
at
length
as
the
editor
s
countenance
gradually
relaxed
into
its
customary
expression
of
moral
supremacy
he
ventured
to
resume
the
discourse
by
asking
is
it
fair
to
inquire
what
great
object
has
brought
you
so
far
from
home
that
object
which
actuates
and
animates
me
in
all
my
gigantic
labours
sir
replied
pott
with
a
calm

my
country
s
i
supposed
it
was
some
public
mission
observed
pickwick
yes
sir
resumed
pott
it
here
bending
towards
pickwick
he
whispered
in
a
deep
hollow
voice
a
buff
ball
sir
will
take
place
in
birmingham
god
bless
me
exclaimed
pickwick
yes
sir
and
supper
added
pott
you
don
t
say
so
ejaculated
pickwick
pott
nodded
portentously
now
although
pickwick
feigned
to
stand
aghast
at
this
disclosure
he
was
so
little
versed
in
local
politics
that
he
was
unable
to
form
an
adequate
comprehension
of
the
importance
of
the
dire
conspiracy
it
referred
to
observing
which
pott
drawing
forth
the
last
number
of
the
eatanswill
and
referring
to
the
same
delivered
himself
of
the
following
paragraph
buffery
a
reptile
contemporary
has
recently
sweltered
forth
his
black
venom
in
the
vain
and
hopeless
attempt
of
sullying
the
fair
name
of
our
distinguished
and
excellent
representative
the
honourable
slumkey
that
slumkey
whom
we
long
before
he
gained
his
present
noble
and
exalted
position
predicted
would
one
day
be
as
he
now
is
at
once
his
country
s
brightest
honour
and
her
proudest
boast
alike
her
bold
defender
and
her
honest
pride
our
reptile
contemporary
we
say
has
made
himself
merry
at
the
expense
of
a
superbly
embossed
plated
scuttle
which
has
been
presented
to
that
glorious
man
by
his
enraptured
constituents
and
towards
the
purchase
of
which
the
nameless
wretch
insinuates
the
honourable
slumkey
himself
contributed
through
a
confidential
friend
of
his
butler
s
more
than
of
the
whole
sum
subscribed
why
does
not
the
crawling
creature
see
that
even
if
this
be
the
fact
the
honourable
slumkey
only
appears
in
a
still
more
amiable
and
radiant
light
than
before
if
that
be
possible
does
not
even
his
obtuseness
perceive
that
this
amiable
and
touching
desire
to
carry
out
the
wishes
of
the
constituent
body
must
for
ever
endear
him
to
the
hearts
and
souls
of
such
of
his
fellow
townsmen
as
are
not
worse
than
swine
or
in
other
words
who
are
not
as
debased
as
our
contemporary
himself
but
such
is
the
wretched
trickery
of
corner
buffery
these
are
not
its
only
artifices
treason
is
abroad
we
boldly
state
now
that
we
are
goaded
to
the
disclosure
and
we
throw
ourselves
on
the
country
and
its
constables
for
protection
we
boldly
state
that
secret
preparations
are
at
this
moment
in
progress
for
a
buff
ball
which
is
to
be
held
in
a
buff
town
in
the
very
heart
and
centre
of
a
buff
population
which
is
to
be
conducted
by
a
buff
master
of
the
ceremonies
which
is
to
be
attended
by
four
ultra
buff
members
of
parliament
and
the
admission
to
which
is
to
be
by
buff
tickets
does
our
fiendish
contemporary
wince
let
him
writhe
in
impotent
malice
as
we
pen
the
words
will
be
there
sir
said
pott
folding
up
the
paper
quite
exhausted
that
is
the
state
of
the
case
the
landlord
and
waiter
entering
at
the
moment
with
dinner
caused
pott
to
lay
his
finger
on
his
lips
in
token
that
he
considered
his
life
in
pickwick
s
hands
and
depended
on
his
secrecy
bob
sawyer
and
benjamin
allen
who
had
irreverently
fallen
asleep
during
the
reading
of
the
quotation
from
the
eatanswill
and
the
discussion
which
followed
it
were
roused
by
the
mere
whispering
of
the
talismanic
word
dinner
in
their
ears
and
to
dinner
they
went
with
good
digestion
waiting
on
appetite
and
health
on
both
and
a
waiter
on
all
three
in
the
course
of
the
dinner
and
the
sitting
which
succeeded
it
pott
descending
for
a
few
moments
to
domestic
topics
informed
pickwick
that
the
air
of
eatanswill
not
agreeing
with
his
lady
she
was
then
engaged
in
making
a
tour
of
different
fashionable
with
a
view
to
the
recovery
of
her
wonted
health
and
spirits
this
was
a
delicate
veiling
of
the
fact
that
pott
acting
upon
her
repeated
threat
of
separation
had
in
virtue
of
an
arrangement
negotiated
by
her
brother
the
lieutenant
and
concluded
by
pott
permanently
retired
with
the
faithful
bodyguard
upon
one
moiety
or
half
part
of
the
annual
income
and
profits
arising
from
the
editorship
and
sale
of
the
eatanswill
while
the
great
pott
was
dwelling
upon
this
and
other
matters
enlivening
the
conversation
from
time
to
time
with
various
extracts
from
his
own
lucubrations
a
stern
stranger
calling
from
the
window
of
a
outward
bound
which
halted
at
the
inn
to
deliver
packages
requested
to
know
whether
if
he
stopped
short
on
his
journey
and
remained
there
for
the
night
he
could
be
furnished
with
the
necessary
accommodation
of
a
bed
and
bedstead
certainly
sir
replied
the
landlord
i
can
can
i
inquired
the
stranger
who
seemed
habitually
suspicious
in
look
and
manner
no
doubt
of
it
sir
replied
the
landlord
good
said
the
stranger
coachman
i
get
down
here
guard
my
bag
bidding
the
other
passengers
in
a
rather
snappish
manner
the
stranger
alighted
he
was
a
shortish
gentleman
with
very
stiff
black
hair
cut
in
the
porcupine
or
style
and
standing
stiff
and
straight
all
over
his
head
his
aspect
was
pompous
and
threatening
his
manner
was
peremptory
his
eyes
were
sharp
and
restless
and
his
whole
bearing
bespoke
a
feeling
of
great
confidence
in
himself
and
a
consciousness
of
immeasurable
superiority
over
all
other
people
this
gentleman
was
shown
into
the
room
originally
assigned
to
the
patriotic
pott
and
the
waiter
remarked
in
dumb
astonishment
at
the
singular
coincidence
that
he
had
no
sooner
lighted
the
candles
than
the
gentleman
diving
into
his
hat
drew
forth
a
newspaper
and
began
to
read
it
with
the
very
same
expression
of
indignant
scorn
which
upon
the
majestic
features
of
pott
had
paralysed
his
energies
an
hour
before
the
man
observed
too
that
whereas
pott
s
scorn
had
been
roused
by
a
newspaper
headed
the
eatanswill
this
gentleman
s
withering
contempt
was
awakened
by
a
newspaper
entitled
the
eatanswill
send
the
landlord
said
the
stranger
yes
sir
rejoined
the
waiter
the
landlord
was
sent
and
came
are
you
the
landlord
inquired
the
gentleman
i
am
sir
replied
the
landlord
do
you
know
me
demanded
the
gentleman
i
have
not
had
that
pleasure
sir
rejoined
the
landlord
my
name
is
slurk
said
the
gentleman
the
landlord
slightly
inclined
his
head
slurk
sir
repeated
the
gentleman
haughtily
do
you
know
me
now
man
the
landlord
scratched
his
head
looked
at
the
ceiling
and
at
the
stranger
and
smiled
feebly
do
you
know
me
man
inquired
the
stranger
angrily
the
landlord
made
a
strong
effort
and
at
length
replied
well
sir
i
do
know
great
heaven
said
the
stranger
dashing
his
clenched
fist
upon
the
table
and
this
is
popularity
the
landlord
took
a
step
or
two
towards
the
door
the
stranger
fixing
his
eyes
upon
him
resumed
this
said
the
stranger
this
is
gratitude
for
years
of
labour
and
study
in
behalf
of
the
masses
i
alight
wet
and
weary
no
enthusiastic
crowds
press
forward
to
greet
their
champion
the
church
bells
are
silent
the
very
name
elicits
no
responsive
feeling
in
their
torpid
bosoms
it
is
enough
said
the
agitated
slurk
pacing
to
and
fro
to
curdle
the
ink
in
one
s
pen
and
induce
one
to
abandon
their
cause
for
did
you
say
sir
said
the
landlord
venturing
a
hint
rum
said
slurk
turning
fiercely
upon
him
have
you
got
a
fire
anywhere
we
can
light
one
directly
sir
said
the
landlord
which
will
throw
out
no
heat
until
it
is
interrupted
slurk
is
there
anybody
in
the
kitchen
not
a
soul
there
was
a
beautiful
fire
everybody
had
gone
and
the
house
door
was
closed
for
the
night
i
will
drink
my
said
slurk
by
the
kitchen
so
gathering
up
his
hat
and
newspaper
he
stalked
solemnly
behind
the
landlord
to
that
humble
apartment
and
throwing
himself
on
a
settle
by
the
fireside
resumed
his
countenance
of
scorn
and
began
to
read
and
drink
in
silent
dignity
now
some
demon
of
discord
flying
over
the
saracen
s
head
at
that
moment
on
casting
down
his
eyes
in
mere
idle
curiosity
happened
to
behold
slurk
established
comfortably
by
the
kitchen
fire
and
pott
slightly
elevated
with
wine
in
another
room
upon
which
the
malicious
demon
darting
down
into
the
apartment
with
inconceivable
rapidity
passed
at
once
into
the
head
of
bob
sawyer
and
prompted
him
for
his
the
demon
s
own
evil
purpose
to
speak
as
follows
i
say
we
ve
let
the
fire
out
it
s
uncommonly
cold
after
the
rain
isn
t
it
it
really
is
replied
pickwick
shivering
it
wouldn
t
be
a
bad
notion
to
have
a
cigar
by
the
kitchen
fire
would
it
said
bob
sawyer
still
prompted
by
the
demon
aforesaid
it
would
be
particularly
comfortable
i
think
replied
pickwick
mr
pott
what
do
you
say
pott
yielded
a
ready
assent
and
all
four
travellers
each
with
his
glass
in
his
hand
at
once
betook
themselves
to
the
kitchen
with
sam
weller
heading
the
procession
to
show
them
the
way
the
stranger
was
still
reading
he
looked
up
and
started
pott
started
what
s
the
matter
whispered
pickwick
that
reptile
replied
pott
what
reptile
said
pickwick
looking
about
him
for
fear
he
should
tread
on
some
overgrown
black
beetle
or
dropsical
spider
that
reptile
whispered
pott
catching
pickwick
by
the
arm
and
pointing
towards
the
stranger
that
reptile
slurk
of
the
perhaps
we
had
better
retire
whispered
pickwick
never
sir
rejoined
pott
in
a
double
sense
with
these
words
pott
took
up
his
position
on
an
opposite
settle
and
selecting
one
from
a
little
bundle
of
newspapers
began
to
read
against
his
enemy
pott
of
course
read
the
and
slurk
of
course
read
the
and
each
gentleman
audibly
expressed
his
contempt
at
the
other
s
compositions
by
bitter
laughs
and
sarcastic
sniffs
whence
they
proceeded
to
more
open
expressions
of
opinion
such
as
absurd
wretched
atrocity
humbug
knavery
dirt
filth
slime
and
other
critical
remarks
of
the
like
nature
both
bob
sawyer
and
ben
allen
had
beheld
these
symptoms
of
rivalry
and
hatred
with
a
degree
of
delight
which
imparted
great
additional
relish
to
the
cigars
at
which
they
were
puffing
most
vigorously
the
moment
they
began
to
flag
the
mischievous
bob
sawyer
addressing
slurk
with
great
politeness
said
will
you
allow
me
to
look
at
your
paper
sir
when
you
have
quite
done
with
it
you
will
find
very
little
to
repay
you
for
your
trouble
in
this
contemptible
sir
replied
slurk
bestowing
a
satanic
frown
on
pott
you
shall
have
this
presently
said
pott
looking
up
pale
with
rage
and
quivering
in
his
speech
from
the
same
cause
ha
ha
you
will
be
amused
with
this
terrible
emphasis
was
laid
upon
thing
and
fellow
and
the
faces
of
both
editors
began
to
glow
with
defiance
the
ribaldry
of
this
miserable
man
is
despicably
disgusting
said
pott
pretending
to
address
bob
sawyer
and
scowling
upon
slurk
here
slurk
laughed
very
heartily
and
folding
up
the
paper
so
as
to
get
at
a
fresh
column
conveniently
said
that
the
blockhead
really
amused
him
what
an
impudent
blunderer
this
fellow
is
said
pott
turning
from
pink
to
crimson
did
you
ever
read
any
of
this
man
s
foolery
sir
inquired
slurk
of
bob
sawyer
never
replied
bob
is
it
very
bad
oh
shocking
shocking
rejoined
slurk
really
dear
me
this
is
too
atrocious
exclaimed
pott
at
this
juncture
still
feigning
to
be
absorbed
in
his
reading
if
you
can
wade
through
a
few
sentences
of
malice
meanness
falsehood
perjury
treachery
and
cant
said
slurk
handing
the
paper
to
bob
you
will
perhaps
be
somewhat
repaid
by
a
laugh
at
the
style
of
this
ungrammatical
what
s
that
you
said
sir
inquired
pott
looking
up
trembling
all
over
with
passion
what
s
that
to
you
sir
replied
slurk
ungrammatical
twaddler
was
it
sir
said
pott
yes
sir
it
was
replied
slurk
and
sir
if
you
like
that
better
ha
ha
pott
retorted
not
a
word
at
this
jocose
insult
but
deliberately
folded
up
his
copy
of
the
flattened
it
carefully
down
crushed
it
beneath
his
boot
spat
upon
it
with
great
ceremony
and
flung
it
into
the
fire
there
sir
said
pott
retreating
from
the
stove
and
that
s
the
way
i
would
serve
the
viper
who
produces
it
if
i
were
not
fortunately
for
him
restrained
by
the
laws
of
my
serve
him
so
sir
cried
slurk
starting
up
those
laws
shall
never
be
appealed
to
by
him
sir
in
such
a
case
serve
him
so
sir
hear
hear
said
bob
sawyer
nothing
can
be
fairer
observed
ben
allen
serve
him
so
sir
reiterated
slurk
in
a
loud
voice
pott
darted
a
look
of
contempt
which
might
have
withered
an
anchor
serve
him
so
sir
reiterated
slurk
in
a
louder
voice
than
before
i
will
not
sir
rejoined
pott
oh
you
won
t
won
t
you
sir
said
slurk
in
a
taunting
manner
you
hear
this
gentlemen
he
won
t
not
that
he
s
afraid
oh
no
he
ha
ha
i
consider
you
sir
said
pott
moved
by
this
sarcasm
i
consider
you
a
viper
i
look
upon
you
sir
as
a
man
who
has
placed
himself
beyond
the
pale
of
society
by
his
most
audacious
disgraceful
and
abominable
public
conduct
i
view
you
sir
personally
and
politically
in
no
other
light
than
as
a
most
unparalleled
and
unmitigated
the
indignant
independent
did
not
wait
to
hear
the
end
of
this
personal
denunciation
for
catching
up
his
which
was
well
stuffed
with
movables
he
swung
it
in
the
air
as
pott
turned
away
and
letting
it
fall
with
a
circular
sweep
on
his
head
just
at
that
particular
angle
of
the
bag
where
a
good
thick
hairbrush
happened
to
be
packed
caused
a
sharp
crash
to
be
heard
throughout
the
kitchen
and
brought
him
at
once
to
the
ground
gentlemen
cried
pickwick
as
pott
started
up
and
seized
the
shovel
gentlemen
consider
for
heaven
s
sake
help
sam
here
pray
gentlemen
interfere
uttering
these
incoherent
exclamations
pickwick
rushed
between
the
infuriated
combatants
just
in
time
to
receive
the
on
one
side
of
his
body
and
the
on
the
other
whether
the
representatives
of
the
public
feeling
of
eatanswill
were
blinded
by
animosity
or
being
both
acute
reasoners
saw
the
advantage
of
having
a
third
party
between
them
to
bear
all
the
blows
certain
it
is
that
they
paid
not
the
slightest
attention
to
pickwick
but
defying
each
other
with
great
spirit
plied
the
and
the
most
fearlessly
pickwick
would
unquestionably
have
suffered
severely
for
his
humane
interference
if
weller
attracted
by
his
master
s
cries
had
not
rushed
in
at
the
moment
and
snatching
up
a
effectually
stopped
the
conflict
by
drawing
it
over
the
head
and
shoulders
of
the
mighty
pott
and
clasping
him
tight
round
the
shoulders

away
that
ere

the

madman

to
ben

and
bob

had
done
nothing
but
dodge
round
the
group

with
a
lancet
in
his
hand
ready
to
bleed

himself
to

removing
the
extinguisher
from

set
him
free
with
a
caution

yourselves
off

him
by

off

removed
to
their
beds
by
the
landlord
under
the
inspection
of

day
when
they
came
to
think
it
over
however
it
occurred
to
them
that
they
could
do
it
much
better
in
print
so
they
recommenced
deadly
hostilities
without
delay
and
all
eatanswill
rung
with
their
boldness
on
paper
they
had
taken
themselves
off
in
separate
coaches
early
next
morning
before
the
other
travellers
were
stirring
and
the
weather
having
now
cleared
up
the
chaise
companions
once
more
turned
their
faces
to
london
chapter
lii
involving
a
serious
change
in
the
weller
family
and
the
untimely
downfall
of
stiggins
considering
it
a
matter
of
delicacy
to
abstain
from
introducing
either
bob
sawyer
or
ben
allen
to
the
young
couple
until
they
were
fully
prepared
to
expect
them
and
wishing
to
spare
arabella
s
feelings
as
much
as
possible
pickwick
proposed
that
he
and
sam
should
alight
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
george
and
vulture
and
that
the
two
young
men
should
for
the
present
take
up
their
quarters
elsewhere
to
this
they
very
readily
agreed
and
the
proposition
was
accordingly
acted
upon
ben
allen
and
bob
sawyer
betaking
themselves
to
a
sequestered
shop
on
the
remotest
confines
of
the
borough
behind
the
bar
door
of
which
their
names
had
in
other
days
very
often
appeared
at
the
head
of
long
and
complex
calculations
worked
in
white
chalk
dear
me
weller
said
the
pretty
housemaid
meeting
sam
at
the
door
dear
i
vish
it
vos
my
dear
replied
sam
dropping
behind
to
let
his
master
get
out
of
hearing
wot

creetur
you

mary
lor
weller
what
nonsense
you
do
talk
said
mary
oh

don
t
what
my
dear
said
sam
why
that
replied
the
pretty
housemaid
lor
do
get
along
with
thus
admonishing
him
the
pretty
housemaid
pushed
sam
against
the
wall
declaring
that
he
had
tumbled
her
cap
and
put
her
hair
quite
out
of
curl
and
prevented
what
i
was
going
to
say
besides
added
mary
there
s
a
letter
been
waiting
here
for
you
four
days
you
hadn
t
gone
away
half
an
hour
when
it
came
and
more
than
that
it
s
got
immediate
on
the
vere
is
it
my
love
inquired
sam
i
took
care
of
it
for
you
or
i
dare
say
it
would
have
been
lost
long
before
this
replied
mary
there
take
it
it
s
more
than
you
with
these
words
after
many
pretty
little
coquettish
doubts
and
fears
and
wishes
that
she
might
not
have
lost
it
mary
produced
the
letter
from
behind
the
nicest
little
muslin
tucker
possible
and
handed
it
to
sam
who
thereupon
kissed
it
with
much
gallantry
and
devotion
my
goodness
me
said
mary
adjusting
the
tucker
and
feigning
unconsciousness
you
seem
to
have
grown
very
fond
of
it
all
at
to
this
weller
only
replied
by
a
wink
the
intense
meaning
of
which
no
description
could
convey
the
faintest
idea
of
and
sitting
himself
down
beside
mary
on
a
opened
the
letter
and
glanced
at
the
contents
hollo
exclaimed
sam

all
this

mary
peeping
over
his
shoulder

sam
looking
up
never
mind
my
eyes

much
better

your
letter
said
the
pretty
housemaid
and
as
she
said
so
she
made
the
eyes
twinkle
with
such
slyness
and
beauty
that
they
were
perfectly
irresistible
sam
refreshed
himself
with
a
kiss
and
read
as

said
the
pretty
housemaid
stop
a
minit
replied
sam
running
over
the
letter
again
and
pausing
here
and
there
to
reflect
as
he
did
so
you

hit

as

my

the
wery
sort
o
thing

d
do
you

mary
my
having
satisfied
himself
on
this
point
sam
read
the
letter
all
over
once
more
and
appearing
to
form
a
clear
notion
of
its
contents
for
the
first
time
ejaculated
thoughtfully
as
he
folded
it
up
and
so
the
poor
creetur
s
dead
i
m
sorry

she
warn
t
a

ooman
if

i
m
wery
sorry
for
weller
uttered
these
words
in
so
serious
a
manner
that
the
pretty
housemaid
cast
down
her
eyes
and
looked
very
grave
hows
ever
said
sam
putting
the
letter
in
his
pocket
with
a
gentle
sigh
it
wos
to
be
and
wos
as
the
old
lady
said
arter
she
d
married
the
footman
can
t
be

mary
mary
shook
her
head
and
sighed
too
i
must
apply

the
hemperor
for
leave
of

said
sam
mary
sighed
again
the
letter
was
so
very
affecting
said
sam
rejoined
the
pretty
housemaid
turning
her
head
away
well
shake
hands
won
t
you
said
sam
the
pretty
housemaid
put
out
a
hand
which
although
it
was
a
housemaid
s
was
a
very
small
one
and
rose
to
go
i
shan

sam

said
mary
giving
her
head
the
slightest
possible
toss
in
the
air
you
no
sooner
come
weller
than
you
go
weller
drew
the
household
beauty
closer
to
him
and
entered
upon
a
whispering
conversation
which
had
not
proceeded
far
when
she
turned
her
face
round
and
condescended
to
look
at
him
again
when
they
parted
it
was
somehow
or
other
indispensably
necessary
for
her
to
go
to
her
room
and
arrange
the
cap
and
curls
before
she
could
think
of
presenting
herself
to
her
mistress
which
preparatory
ceremony
she
went
off
to
perform
bestowing
many
nods
and
smiles
on
sam
over
the
banisters
as
she
tripped
upstairs
i
shan
t
be
avay
more
than
a
day
or
two
sir
at
the
furthest
said
sam
when
he
had
communicated
to
pickwick
the
intelligence
of
his
father
s
loss
as
long
as
may
be
necessary
sam
replied
pickwick
you
have
my
full
permission
to
sam
bowed
you
will
tell
your
father
sam
that
if
i
can
be
of
any
assistance
to
him
in
his
present
situation
i
shall
be
most
willing
and
ready
to
lend
him
any
aid
in
my
power
said
pickwick
thank
ee
sir
rejoined
sam
i
ll
mention
it
and
with
some
expressions
of
mutual
and
interest
master
and
man
separated
it
was
just
seven
o
clock
when
samuel
weller
alighting
from
the
box
of
a
which
passed
through
dorking
stood
within
a
few
hundred
yards
of
the
marquis
of
granby
it
was
a
cold
dull
evening
the
little
street
looked
dreary
and
dismal
and
the
mahogany
countenance
of
the
noble
and
gallant
marquis
seemed
to
wear
a
more
sad
and
melancholy
expression
than
it
was
wont
to
do
as
it
swung
to
and
fro
creaking
mournfully
in
the
wind
the
blinds
were
pulled
down
and
the
shutters
partly
closed
of
the
knot
of
loungers
that
usually
collected
about
the
door
not
one
was
to
be
seen
the
place
was
silent
and
desolate
seeing
nobody
of
whom
he
could
ask
any
preliminary
questions
sam
walked
softly
in
and
glancing
round
he
quickly
recognised
his
parent
in
the
distance
the
widower
was
seated
at
a
small
round
table
in
the
little
room
behind
the
bar
smoking
a
pipe
with
his
eyes
intently
fixed
upon
the
fire
the
funeral
had
evidently
taken
place
that
day
for
attached
to
his
hat
which
he
still
retained
on
his
head
was
a
hatband
measuring
about
a
yard
and
a
half
in
length
which
hung
over
the
top
rail
of
the
chair
and
streamed
negligently
down
weller
was
in
a
very
abstracted
and
contemplative
mood
notwithstanding
that
sam
called
him
by
name
several
times
he
still
continued
to
smoke
with
the
same
fixed
and
quiet
countenance
and
was
only
roused
ultimately
by
his
son
s
placing
the
palm
of
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
sammy
said
weller
you
re
i
ve
been
to
you
half
a
dozen
times
said
sam
hanging
his
hat
on
a
peg
but
you
didn
t
hear
no
sammy
replied
weller
again
looking
thoughtfully
at
the
fire
i
was
in
a
referee
wot
about
inquired
sam
drawing
his
chair
up
to
the
fire
in
a
referee
sammy
replied
the
elder
weller
regarding
here
weller
jerked
his
head
in
the
direction
of
dorking
churchyard
in
mute
explanation
that
his
words
referred
to
the
late
weller
i
wos
sammy
said
weller
eyeing
his
son
with
great
earnestness
over
his
pipe
as
if
to
assure
him
that
however
extraordinary
and
incredible
the
declaration
might
appear
it
was
nevertheless
calmly
and
deliberately
uttered
i
wos
sammy
that
upon
the
whole
i
wos
wery
sorry
she
wos
vell
and
so
you
ought
to
be
replied
sam
weller
nodded
his
acquiescence
in
the
sentiment
and
again
fastening
his
eyes
on
the
fire
shrouded
himself
in
a
cloud
and
mused
deeply
those
wos
wery
sensible
observations
as
she
made
sammy
said
weller
driving
the
smoke
away
with
his
hand
after
a
long
silence
wot
observations
inquired
sam
them
as
she
made
arter
she
was
took
ill
replied
the
old
gentleman
wot
was
they
somethin
to
this
here
effect
veller
she
says
i
m
afeered
i
ve
not
done
by
you
quite
wot
i
ought
to
have
done
you
re
a
wery
hearted
man
and
i
might
ha
made
your
home
more
comfortabler
i
begin
to
see
now
she
says
ven
it
s
too
late
that
if
a
married
ooman
vishes
to
be
religious
she
should
begin
vith
dischargin
her
dooties
at
home
and
makin
them
as
is
about
her
cheerful
and
happy
and
that
vile
she
goes
to
church
or
chapel
or
wot
not
at
all
proper
times
she
should
be
wery
careful
not
to
this
sort
o
thing
into
a
excuse
for
idleness
or
i
have
done
this
she
says
and
i
ve
vasted
time
and
substance
on
them
as
has
done
it
more
than
me
but
i
hope
ven
i
m
gone
veller
that
you
ll
think
on
me
as
i
wos
afore
i
know
d
them
people
and
as
i
raly
wos
by
susan
says
i
i

up
wery
short
by
this
samivel
i
von
t

my
boy
susan
i
says
you

a
wery
good
vife
to
me
altogether
don
t
say
nothin
at
all
about

keep
a
good

my
dear
and
you
ll
live
to
see
me
punch
that
ere
stiggins
s
head
she
smiled
at
this
samivel
said
the
old
gentleman
stifling
a
sigh
with
his
pipe
but
she
died
arter
all
vell
said
sam
venturing
to
offer
a
little
homely
consolation
after
the
lapse
of
three
or
four
minutes
consumed
by
the
old
gentleman
in
slowly
shaking
his
head
from
side
to
side
and
solemnly
smoking
vell
gov
nor
ve
must
all
come
to
it
one
day
or
so
we
must
sammy
said
weller
the
elder
there
s
a
providence
in
it
all
said
sam
o
course
there
is
replied
his
father
with
a
nod
of
grave
approval
wot
ud
become
of
the
undertakers
vithout
it
sammy
lost
in
the
immense
field
of
conjecture
opened
by
this
reflection
the
elder
weller
laid
his
pipe
on
the
table
and
stirred
the
fire
with
a
meditative
visage
while
the
old
gentleman
was
thus
engaged
a
very
cook
dressed
in
mourning
who
had
been
bustling
about
in
the
bar
glided
into
the
room
and
bestowing
many
smirks
of
recognition
upon
sam
silently
stationed
herself
at
the
back
of
his
father
s
chair
and
announced
her
presence
by
a
slight
cough
the
which
being
disregarded
was
followed
by
a
louder
one
hollo
said
the
elder
weller
dropping
the
poker
as
he
looked
round
and
hastily
drew
his
chair
away
wot
s
the
matter
now
have
a
cup
of
tea
there
s
a
good
soul
replied
the
buxom
female
coaxingly
i
von
t
replied
weller
in
a
somewhat
boisterous
manner
i
ll
see
you
weller
hastily
checked
himself
and
added
in
a
low
tone
furder
oh
dear
dear
how
adwersity
does
change
people
said
the
lady
looking
upwards
it
s
the
only
thing
twixt
this
and
the
doctor
as
shall
change
my
condition
muttered
weller
i
really
never
saw
a
man
so
cross
said
the
buxom
female
never

all
for
my
own
good
vich
is
the
reflection
vith
vich
the
penitent
comforted
his
feelin
s
ven
they
flogged
him
rejoined
the
old
gentleman
the
buxom
female
shook
her
head
with
a
compassionate
and
sympathising
air
and
appealing
to
sam
inquired
whether
his
father
really
ought
not
to
make
an
effort
to
keep
up
and
not
give
way
to
that
lowness
of
spirits
you
see
samuel
said
the
buxom
female
as
i
was
telling
him
yesterday
he
will
feel
lonely
he
can
t
expect
but
what
he
should
sir
but
he
should
keep
up
a
good
heart
because
dear
me
i
m
sure
we
all
pity
his
loss
and
are
ready
to
do
anything
for
him
and
there
s
no
situation
in
life
so
bad
samuel
that
it
can
t
be
mended
which
is
what
a
very
worthy
person
said
to
me
when
my
husband
here
the
speaker
putting
her
hand
before
her
mouth
coughed
again
and
looked
affectionately
at
the
elder
weller
as
i
don
t
rekvire
any
o
your
conversation
just
now
mum
vill
you
have
the
goodness
to
inquired
weller
in
a
grave
and
steady
voice

the
buxom
female
i
m
sure
i
only
spoke
to
you
out
of
wery
likely
mum
replied
weller
samivel
show
the
lady
out
and
shut
the
door
after
this
hint
was
not
lost
upon
the
buxom
female
for
she
at
once
left
the
room

the

broken
an
obstinate
lump
of
coal
with
a
countenance
expressive
of
as
much
earnestness
and
malice
as

than

interrupted
sam
cos

replied
weller
looking
fixedly
at
his
son
cos
a
coachman
may
do
vithout
suspicion
wot
other
men
may
not
cos
a

and

nobody

refilled
and
relighted

and
once

meditative
expression
of
countenance
continued
as

delivered
this
warning
weller
resumed
his
pipe
with
a
more
serene
countenance
the
disclosure
of
these
matters
appearing
to
have
eased
his
mind
considerably
somebody
s
at
the
door
said
sam
let
em
tap
replied
his
father
with
dignity
sam
acted
upon
the
direction
there
was
another
tap
and
another
and
then
a
long
row
of
taps
upon
which
sam
inquired
why
the
tapper
was
not
admitted
hush
whispered
weller
with
apprehensive
looks
don
t
take
no
notice
on
em
sammy
it
s
vun
o
the
widders
p
no
notice
being
taken
of
the
taps
the
unseen
visitor
after
a
short
lapse
ventured
to
open
the
door
and
peep
in
it
was
no
female
head
that
was
thrust
in
at
the
door
but
the
long
black
locks
and
red
face
of
stiggins
weller
s
pipe
fell
from
his
hands
the
reverend
gentleman
gradually
opened
the
door
by
almost
imperceptible
degrees
until
the
aperture
was
just
wide
enough
to
admit
of
the
passage
of
his
lank
body
when
he
glided
into
the
room
and
closed
it
after
him
with
great
care
and
gentleness
turning
towards
sam
and
raising
his
hands
and
eyes
in
token
of
the
unspeakable
sorrow
with
which
he
regarded
the
calamity
that
had
befallen
the
family
he
carried
the
chair
to
his
old
corner
by
the
fire
and
seating
himself
on
the
very
edge
drew
forth
a
brown
and
applied
the
same
to
his
optics
while
this
was
going
forward
the
elder
weller
sat
back
in
his
chair
with
his
eyes
wide
open
his
hands
planted
on
his
knees
and
his
whole
countenance
expressive
of
absorbing
and
overwhelming
astonishment
sam
sat
opposite
him
in
perfect
silence
waiting
with
eager
curiosity
for
the
termination
of
the
scene
stiggins
kept
the
brown
before
his
eyes
for
some
minutes
moaning
decently
meanwhile
and
then
mastering
his
feelings
by
a
strong
effort
put
it
in
his
pocket
and
buttoned
it
up
after
this
he
stirred
the
fire
after
that
he
rubbed
his
hands
and
looked
at
sam
oh
my
young
friend
said
stiggins
breaking
the
silence
in
a
very
low
voice
here
s
a
sorrowful
affliction
sam
nodded
very
slightly
for
the
man
of
wrath
too
added
stiggins
it
makes
a
vessel
s
heart
bleed
weller
was
overheard
by
his
son
to
murmur
something
relative
to
making
a
vessel
s
nose
bleed
but
stiggins
heard
him
not
do
you
know
young
man
whispered
stiggins
drawing
his
chair
closer
to
sam
whether
she
has
left
emanuel
anything
who
s
he
inquired
sam
the
chapel
replied
stiggins
our
chapel
our
fold
she
hasn
t
left
the
fold
nothin
nor
the
shepherd
nothin
nor
the
animals
nothin
said
sam
decisively
nor
the
dogs
stiggins
looked
slily
at
sam
glanced
at
the
old
gentleman
who
was
sitting
with
his
eyes
closed
as
if
asleep
and
drawing
his
chair
still
nearer
said
nothing
for
samuel
sam
shook
his
head
i
think
there
s
something
said
stiggins
turning
as
pale
as
he
could
turn
consider
samuel
no
little
token
not
so
much
as
the
vorth
o
that
ere
old
umberella
o
yourn
replied
sam
perhaps
said
stiggins
hesitatingly
after
a
few
moments
deep
thought
perhaps
she
recommended
me
to
the
care
of
the
man
of
wrath
samuel
i
think
that
s
wery
likely
from
what
he
said
rejoined
sam
he
wos
about
you
jist
was
he
though
exclaimed
stiggins
brightening
up
ah
he
s
changed
i
dare
say
we
might
live
very
comfortably
together
now
samuel
eh
i
could
take
care
of
his
property
when
you
are
away
good
care
you
heaving
a
sigh
stiggins
paused
for
a
response
sam
nodded
and
weller
the
elder
gave
vent
to
an
extraordinary
sound
which
being
neither
a
groan
nor
a
grunt
nor
a
gasp
nor
a
growl
seemed
to
partake
in
some
degree
of
the
character
of
all
four
stiggins
encouraged
by
this
sound
which
he
understood
to
betoken
remorse
or
repentance
looked
about
him
rubbed
his
hands
wept
smiled
wept
again
and
then
walking
softly
across
the
room
to
a
remembered
shelf
in
one
corner
took
down
a
tumbler
and
with
great
deliberation
put
four
lumps
of
sugar
in
it
having
got
thus
far
he
looked
about
him
again
and
sighed
grievously
with
that
he
walked
softly
into
the
bar
and
presently
returning
with
the
tumbler
half
full
of
rum
advanced
to
the
kettle
which
was
singing
gaily
on
the
hob
mixed
his
grog
stirred
it
sipped
it
sat
down
and
taking
a
long
and
hearty
pull
at
the
stopped
for
breath
the
elder
weller
who
still
continued
to
make
various
strange
and
uncouth
attempts
to
appear
asleep
offered
not
a
single
word
during
these
proceedings
but
when
stiggins
stopped
for
breath
he
darted
upon
him
and
snatching
the
tumbler
from
his
hand
threw
the
remainder
of
the
in
his
face
and
the
glass
itself
into
the
grate
then
seizing
the
reverend
gentleman
firmly
by
the
collar
he
suddenly
fell
to
kicking
him
most
furiously
accompanying
every
application
of
his
boot
to
stiggins
s
person
with
sundry
violent
and
incoherent
anathemas
upon
his
limbs
eyes
and
body
sammy
said
weller
put
my
hat
on
tight
for
sam
dutifully
adjusted
the
hat
with
the
long
hatband
more
firmly
on
his
father
s
head
and
the
old
gentleman
resuming
his
kicking
with
greater
agility
than
before
tumbled
with
stiggins
through
the
bar
and
through
the
passage
out
at
the
front
door
and
so
into
the
street
the
kicking
continuing
the
whole
way
and
increasing
in
vehemence
rather
than
diminishing
every
time
the
was
lifted
it
was
a
beautiful
and
exhilarating
sight
to
see
the
man
writhing
in
weller
s
grasp
and
his
whole
frame
quivering
with
anguish
as
kick
followed
kick
in
rapid
succession
it
was
a
still
more
exciting
spectacle
to
behold
weller
after
a
powerful
struggle
immersing
stiggins
s
head
in
a
full
of
water
and
holding
it
there
until
he
was
half
suffocated
there
said
weller
throwing
all
his
energy
into
one
most
complicated
kick
as
he
at
length
permitted
stiggins
to
withdraw
his
head
from
the
trough
send
any
vun
o
them
lazy
shepherds
here
and
i
ll
pound
him
to
a
jelly
first
and
drownd
him
artervards
sammy
help
me
in
and
fill
me
a
small
glass
of
brandy
i

out
o

my
chapter
liii
comprising
the
final
exit
of
jingle
and
job
trotter
with
a
great
morning
of
business
in
gray
s
inn
square
concluding
with
a
double
knock
at
perker
s
door
when
arabella
after
some
gentle
preparation
and
many
assurances
that
there
was
not
the
least
occasion
for
being
was
at
length
made
acquainted
by
pickwick
with
the
unsatisfactory
result
of
his
visit
to
birmingham
she
burst
into
tears
and
sobbing
aloud
lamented
in
moving
terms
that
she
should
have
been
the
unhappy
cause
of
any
estrangement
between
a
father
and
his
son
my
dear
girl
said
pickwick
kindly
it
is
no
fault
of
yours
it
was
impossible
to
foresee
that
the
old
gentleman
would
be
so
strongly
prepossessed
against
his
son
s
marriage
you
know
i
am
sure
added
pickwick
glancing
at
her
pretty
face
he
can
have
very
little
idea
of
the
pleasure
he
denies
oh
my
dear
pickwick
said
arabella
what
shall
we
do
if
he
continues
to
be
angry
with
us
why
wait
patiently
my
dear
until
he
thinks
better
of
it
replied
pickwick
cheerfully
but
dear
pickwick
what
is
to
become
of
nathaniel
if
his
father
withdraws
his
assistance
urged
arabella
in
that
case
my
love
rejoined
pickwick
i
will
venture
to
prophesy
that
he
will
find
some
other
friend
who
will
not
be
backward
in
helping
him
to
start
in
the
the
significance
of
this
reply
was
not
so
well
disguised
by
pickwick
but
that
arabella
understood
it
so
throwing
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
kissing
him
affectionately
she
sobbed
louder
than
before
come
come
said
pickwick
taking
her
hand
we
will
wait
here
a
few
days
longer
and
see
whether
he
writes
or
takes
any
other
notice
of
your
husband
s
communication
if
not
i
have
thought
of
half
a
dozen
plans
any
one
of
which
would
make
you
happy
at
once
there
my
dear
there
with
these
words
pickwick
gently
pressed
arabella
s
hand
and
bade
her
dry
her
eyes
and
not
distress
her
husband
upon
which
arabella
who
was
one
of
the
best
little
creatures
alive
put
her
handkerchief
in
her
reticule
and
by
the
time
winkle
joined
them
exhibited
in
full
lustre
the
same
beaming
smiles
and
sparkling
eyes
that
had
originally
captivated
him
this
is
a
distressing
predicament
for
these
young
people
thought
pickwick
as
he
dressed
himself
next
morning
i
ll
walk
up
to
perker
s
and
consult
him
about
the
as
pickwick
was
further
prompted
to
betake
himself
to
gray
s
inn
square
by
an
anxious
desire
to
come
to
a
pecuniary
settlement
with
the
little
attorney
without
further
delay
he
made
a
hurried
breakfast
and
executed
his
intention
so
speedily
that
ten
o
clock
had
not
struck
when
he
reached
gray
s
inn
it
still
wanted
ten
minutes
to
the
hour
when
he
had
ascended
the
staircase
on
which
perker
s
chambers
were
the
clerks
had
not
arrived
yet
and
he
beguiled
the
time
by
looking
out
of
the
staircase
window
the
healthy
light
of
a
fine
october
morning
made
even
the
dingy
old
houses
brighten
up
a
little
some
of
the
dusty
windows
actually
looking
almost
cheerful
as
the
sun
s
rays
gleamed
upon
them
clerk
after
clerk
hastened
into
the
square
by
one
or
other
of
the
entrances
and
looking
up
at
the
hall
clock
accelerated
or
decreased
his
rate
of
walking
according
to
the
time
at
which
his
office
hours
nominally
commenced
the
nine
o
clock
people
suddenly
becoming
very
brisk
and
the
ten
o
clock
gentlemen
falling
into
a
pace
of
most
aristocratic
slowness
the
clock
struck
ten
and
clerks
poured
in
faster
than
ever
each
one
in
a
greater
perspiration
than
his
predecessor
the
noise
of
unlocking
and
opening
doors
echoed
and
on
every
side
heads
appeared
as
if
by
magic
in
every
window
the
porters
took
up
their
stations
for
the
day
the
slipshod
laundresses
hurried
off
the
postman
ran
from
house
to
house
and
the
whole
legal
hive
was
in
a
bustle
you
re
early
pickwick
said
a
voice
behind
him
ah
lowten
replied
that
gentleman
looking
round
and
recognising
his
old
acquaintance
precious
warm
walking
isn
t
it
said
lowten
drawing
a
bramah
key
from
his
pocket
with
a
small
plug
therein
to
keep
the
dust
out
you
appear
to
feel
it
so
rejoined
pickwick
smiling
at
the
clerk
who
was
literally
i
ve
come
along
rather
i
can
tell
you
replied
lowten
it
went
the
half
hour
as
i
came
through
the
polygon
i
m
here
before
him
though
so
i
don
t
comforting
himself
with
this
reflection
lowten
extracted
the
plug
from
the
having
opened
the
door
replugged
and
repocketed
his
bramah
and
picked
up
the
letters
which
the
postman
had
dropped
through
the
box
he
ushered
pickwick
into
the
office
here
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
he
divested
himself
of
his
coat
put
on
a
threadbare
garment
which
he
took
out
of
a
desk
hung
up
his
hat
pulled
forth
a
few
sheets
of
cartridge
and
in
alternate
layers
and
sticking
a
pen
behind
his
ear
rubbed
his
hands
with
an
air
of
great
satisfaction
there
you
see
pickwick
he
said
now
i
m
complete
i
ve
got
my
office
coat
on
and
my
pad
out
and
let
him
come
as
soon
as
he
likes
you
haven
t
got
a
pinch
of
snuff
about
you
have
you
no
i
have
not
replied
pickwick
i
m
sorry
for
it
said
lowten
never
mind
i
ll
run
out
presently
and
get
a
bottle
of
soda
don
t
i
look
rather
queer
about
the
eyes
pickwick
the
individual
appealed
to
surveyed
lowten
s
eyes
from
a
distance
and
expressed
his
opinion
that
no
unusual
queerness
was
perceptible
in
those
features
i
m
glad
of
it
said
lowten
we
were
keeping
it
up
pretty
tolerably
at
the
stump
last
night
and
i
m
rather
out
of
sorts
this
morning
perker
s
been
about
that
business
of
yours
by
the
what
business
inquired
pickwick
mrs
bardell
s
costs
no
i
don
t
mean
that
replied
lowten
about
getting
that
customer
that
we
paid
the
ten
shillings
in
the
pound
to
the
discounter
for
on
your
account
to
get
him
out
of
the
fleet
you
know
about
getting
him
to
oh
jingle
said
pickwick
hastily
yes
well
well
it
s
all
arranged
said
lowten
mending
his
pen
the
agent
at
liverpool
said
he
had
been
obliged
to
you
many
times
when
you
were
in
business
and
he
would
be
glad
to
take
him
on
your
that
s
well
said
pickwick
i
am
delighted
to
hear
but
i
say
resumed
lowten
scraping
the
back
of
the
pen
preparatory
to
making
a
fresh
split
what
a
soft
chap
that
other
is
which
other
why
that
servant
or
friend
or
whatever
he
is
you
know
ah
said
pickwick
with
a
smile
i
always
thought
him
the
well
and
so
did
i
from
what
little
i
saw
of
him
replied
lowten
it
only
shows
how
one
may
be
deceived
what
do
you
think
of
his
going
to
demerara
too
what
and
giving
up
what
was
offered
him
here
exclaimed
pickwick
treating
perker
s
offer
of
eighteen
bob
a
week
and
a
rise
if
he
behaved
himself
like
dirt
replied
lowten
he
said
he
must
go
along
with
the
other
one
and
so
they
persuaded
perker
to
write
again
and
they
ve
got
him
something
on
the
same
estate
not
near
so
good
perker
says
as
a
convict
would
get
in
new
south
wales
if
he
appeared
at
his
trial
in
a
new
suit
of
foolish
fellow
said
pickwick
with
glistening
eyes
foolish
oh
it
s
worse
than
foolish
it
s
downright
sneaking
you
know
replied
lowten
nibbing
the
pen
with
a
contemptuous
face
he
says
that
he
s
the
only
friend
he
ever
had
and
he
s
attached
to
him
and
all
that
friendship
s
a
very
good
thing
in
its
way
we
are
all
very
friendly
and
comfortable
at
the
stump
for
instance
over
our
grog
where
every
man
pays
for
himself
but
damn
hurting
yourself
for
anybody
else
you
know
no
man
should
have
more
than
two
attachments
the
first
to
number
one
and
the
second
to
the
ladies
that
s
what
i
say
ha
ha
lowten
concluded
with
a
loud
laugh
half
in
jocularity
and
half
in
derision
which
was
prematurely
cut
short
by
the
sound
of
perker
s
footsteps
on
the
stairs
at
the
first
approach
of
which
he
vaulted
on
his
stool
with
an
agility
most
remarkable
and
wrote
intensely
the
greeting
between
pickwick
and
his
professional
adviser
was
warm
and
cordial
the
client
was
scarcely
ensconced
in
the
attorney
s
chair
however
when
a
knock
was
heard
at
the
door
and
a
voice
inquired
whether
perker
was
within
hark
said
perker
that
s
one
of
our
vagabond
friends
jingle
himself
my
dear
sir
will
you
see
him
what
do
you
think
inquired
pickwick
hesitating
yes
i
think
you
had
better
here
you
sir
what
s
your
name
walk
in
will
you
in
compliance
with
this
unceremonious
invitation
jingle
and
job
walked
into
the
room
but
seeing
pickwick
stopped
short
in
some
confusion
well
said
perker
don
t
you
know
that
gentleman
good
reason
to
replied
jingle
stepping
forward
mr
pickwick
deepest
obligations
life
preserver
made
a
man
of
me
you
shall
never
repent
it
i
am
happy
to
hear
you
say
so
said
pickwick
you
look
much
thanks
to
you
sir
great
change
majesty
s
fleet
unwholesome
place
very
said
jingle
shaking
his
head
he
was
decently
and
cleanly
dressed
and
so
was
job
who
stood
bolt
upright
behind
him
staring
at
pickwick
with
a
visage
of
iron
when
do
they
go
to
liverpool
inquired
pickwick
half
aside
to
perker
this
evening
sir
at
seven
o
clock
said
job
taking
one
step
forward
by
the
heavy
coach
from
the
city
are
your
places
taken
they
are
sir
replied
job
you
have
fully
made
up
your
mind
to
go
i
have
sir
answered
job
with
regard
to
such
an
outfit
as
was
indispensable
for
jingle
said
perker
addressing
pickwick
aloud
i
have
taken
upon
myself
to
make
an
arrangement
for
the
deduction
of
a
small
sum
from
his
quarterly
salary
which
being
made
only
for
one
year
and
regularly
remitted
will
provide
for
that
expense
i
entirely
disapprove
of
your
doing
anything
for
him
my
dear
sir
which
is
not
dependent
on
his
own
exertions
and
good
certainly
interposed
jingle
with
great
firmness
clear
head
man
of
the
world
quite
right
by
compounding
with
his
creditor
releasing
his
clothes
from
the
pawnbroker
s
relieving
him
in
prison
and
paying
for
his
passage
continued
perker
without
noticing
jingle
s
observation
you
have
already
lost
upwards
of
fifty
not
lost
said
jingle
hastily
pay
it
all
stick
to
business
cash
up
every
farthing
yellow
fever
perhaps
can
t
help
that
if
not
here
jingle
paused
and
striking
the
crown
of
his
hat
with
great
violence
passed
his
hand
over
his
eyes
and
sat
down
he
means
to
say
said
job
advancing
a
few
paces
that
if
he
is
not
carried
off
by
the
fever
he
will
pay
the
money
back
again
if
he
lives
he
will
pickwick
i
will
see
it
done
i
know
he
will
sir
said
job
with
energy
i
could
undertake
to
swear
well
well
said
pickwick
who
had
been
bestowing
a
score
or
two
of
frowns
upon
perker
to
stop
his
summary
of
benefits
conferred
which
the
little
attorney
obstinately
disregarded
you
must
be
careful
not
to
play
any
more
desperate
cricket
matches
jingle
or
to
renew
your
acquaintance
with
sir
thomas
blazo
and
i
have
little
doubt
of
your
preserving
your
jingle
smiled
at
this
sally
but
looked
rather
foolish
notwithstanding
so
pickwick
changed
the
subject
by
saying
you
don
t
happen
to
know
do
you
what
has
become
of
another
friend
of
yours
a
more
humble
one
whom
i
saw
at
rochester
dismal
jemmy
inquired
jingle
jingle
shook
his
head
clever
rascal
queer
fellow
hoaxing
genius
job
s
job
s
brother
exclaimed
pickwick
well
now
i
look
at
him
closely
there
a
we
were
always
considered
like
each
other
sir
said
job
with
a
cunning
look
just
lurking
in
the
corners
of
his
eyes
only
i
was
really
of
a
serious
nature
and
he
never
was
he
emigrated
to
america
sir
in
consequence
of
being
too
much
sought
after
here
to
be
comfortable
and
has
never
been
heard
of
that
accounts
for
my
not
having
received
the
page
from
the
romance
of
real
life
which
he
promised
me
one
morning
when
he
appeared
to
be
contemplating
suicide
on
rochester
bridge
i
suppose
said
pickwick
smiling
i
need
not
inquire
whether
his
dismal
behaviour
was
natural
or
he
could
assume
anything
sir
said
job
you
may
consider
yourself
very
fortunate
in
having
escaped
him
so
easily
on
intimate
terms
he
would
have
been
even
a
more
dangerous
acquaintance
than
job
looked
at
jingle
hesitated
and
finally
added
than
a
hopeful
family
yours
trotter
said
perker
sealing
a
letter
which
he
had
just
finished
writing
yes
sir
replied
job
very
much
well
said
the
little
man
laughing
i
hope
you
are
going
to
disgrace
it
deliver
this
letter
to
the
agent
when
you
reach
liverpool
and
let
me
advise
you
gentlemen
not
to
be
too
knowing
in
the
west
indies
if
you
throw
away
this
chance
you
will
both
richly
deserve
to
be
hanged
as
i
sincerely
trust
you
will
be
and
now
you
had
better
leave
pickwick
and
me
alone
for
we
have
other
matters
to
talk
over
and
time
is
as
perker
said
this
he
looked
towards
the
door
with
an
evident
desire
to
render
the
as
brief
as
possible
it
was
brief
enough
on
jingle
s
part
he
thanked
the
little
attorney
in
a
few
hurried
words
for
the
kindness
and
promptitude
with
which
he
had
rendered
his
assistance
and
turning
to
his
benefactor
stood
for
a
few
seconds
as
if
irresolute
what
to
say
or
how
to
act
job
trotter
relieved
his
perplexity
for
with
a
humble
and
grateful
bow
to
pickwick
he
took
his
friend
gently
by
the
arm
and
led
him
away
a
worthy
couple
said
perker
as
the
door
closed
behind
them
i
hope
they
may
become
so
replied
pickwick
what
do
you
think
is
there
any
chance
of
their
permanent
reformation
perker
shrugged
his
shoulders
doubtfully
but
observing
pickwick
s
anxious
and
disappointed
look
rejoined
of
course
there
is
a
chance
i
hope
it
may
prove
a
good
one
they
are
unquestionably
penitent
now
but
then
you
know
they
have
the
recollection
of
very
recent
suffering
fresh
upon
them
what
they
may
become
when
that
fades
away
is
a
problem
that
neither
you
nor
i
can
solve
however
my
dear
sir
added
perker
laying
his
hand
on
pickwick
s
shoulder
your
object
is
equally
honourable
whatever
the
result
is
whether
that
species
of
benevolence
which
is
so
very
cautious
and
that
it
is
seldom
exercised
at
all
lest
its
owner
should
be
imposed
upon
and
so
wounded
in
his
be
real
charity
or
a
worldly
counterfeit
i
leave
to
wiser
heads
than
mine
to
determine
but
if
those
two
fellows
were
to
commit
a
burglary
my
opinion
of
this
action
would
be
equally
with
these
remarks
which
were
delivered
in
a
much
more
animated
and
earnest
manner
than
is
usual
in
legal
gentlemen
perker
drew
his
chair
to
his
desk
and
listened
to
pickwick
s
recital
of
old
winkle
s
obstinacy
give
him
a
week
said
perker
nodding
his
head
prophetically
do
you
think
he
will
come
round
inquired
pickwick
i
think
he
will
rejoined
perker
if
not
we
must
try
the
young
lady
s
persuasion
and
that
is
what
anybody
but
you
would
have
done
at
perker
was
taking
a
pinch
of
snuff
with
various
grotesque
contractions
of
countenance
eulogistic
of
the
persuasive
powers
appertaining
unto
young
ladies
when
the
murmur
of
inquiry
and
answer
was
heard
in
the
outer
office
and
lowten
tapped
at
the
door
come
in
cried
the
little
man
the
clerk
came
in
and
shut
the
door
after
him
with
great
mystery
what
s
the
matter
inquired
perker
you
re
wanted
who
wants
me
lowten
looked
at
pickwick
and
coughed
who
wants
me
can
t
you
speak
lowten
why
sir
replied
lowten
it
s
dodson
and
fogg
is
with
bless
my
life
said
the
little
man
looking
at
his
watch
i
appointed
them
to
be
here
at
eleven
to
settle
that
matter
of
yours
pickwick
i
gave
them
an
undertaking
on
which
they
sent
down
your
discharge
it
s
very
awkward
my
dear
sir
what
will
you
do
would
you
like
to
step
into
the
next
room
the
next
room
being
the
identical
room
in
which
dodson
fogg
were
pickwick
replied
that
he
would
remain
where
he
was
the
more
especially
as
dodson
fogg
ought
to
be
ashamed
to
look
him
in
the
face
instead
of
his
being
ashamed
to
see
them
which
latter
circumstance
he
begged
perker
to
note
with
a
glowing
countenance
and
many
marks
of
indignation
very
well
my
dear
sir
very
well
replied
perker
i
can
only
say
that
if
you
expect
either
dodson
or
fogg
to
exhibit
any
symptom
of
shame
or
confusion
at
having
to
look
you
or
anybody
else
in
the
face
you
are
the
most
sanguine
man
in
your
expectations
that
i
ever
met
with
show
them
in
lowten
disappeared
with
a
grin
and
immediately
returned
ushering
in
the
firm
in
due
form
of
precedence
dodson
first
and
fogg
afterwards
you
have
seen
pickwick
i
believe
said
perker
to
dodson
inclining
his
pen
in
the
direction
where
that
gentleman
was
seated
how
do
you
do
pickwick
said
dodson
in
a
loud
voice
dear
me
cried
fogg
how
do
you
do
pickwick
i
hope
you
are
well
sir
i
thought
i
knew
the
face
said
fogg
drawing
up
a
chair
and
looking
round
him
with
a
smile
pickwick
bent
his
head
very
slightly
in
answer
to
these
salutations
and
seeing
fogg
pull
a
bundle
of
papers
from
his
coat
pocket
rose
and
walked
to
the
window
there
s
no
occasion
for
pickwick
to
move
perker
said
fogg
untying
the
red
tape
which
encircled
the
little
bundle
and
smiling
again
more
sweetly
than
before
mr
pickwick
is
pretty
well
acquainted
with
these
proceedings
there
are
no
secrets
between
us
i
think
he
he
he
not
many
i
think
said
dodson
ha
ha
ha
then
both
the
partners
laughed
together
pleasantly
and
cheerfully
as
men
who
are
going
to
receive
money
often
do
we
shall
make
pickwick
pay
for
peeping
said
fogg
with
considerable
native
humour
as
he
unfolded
his
papers
the
amount
of
the
taxed
costs
is
one
hundred
and
six
four
there
was
a
great
comparing
of
papers
and
turning
over
of
leaves
by
fogg
and
perker
after
this
statement
of
profit
and
loss
meanwhile
dodson
said
in
an
affable
manner
to
pickwick
i
don
t
think
you
are
looking
quite
so
stout
as
when
i
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
last
possibly
not
sir
replied
pickwick
who
had
been
flashing
forth
looks
of
fierce
indignation
without
producing
the
smallest
effect
on
either
of
the
sharp
practitioners
i
believe
i
am
not
sir
i
have
been
persecuted
and
annoyed
by
scoundrels
of
late
perker
coughed
violently
and
asked
pickwick
whether
he
wouldn
t
like
to
look
at
the
morning
paper
to
which
inquiry
pickwick
returned
a
most
decided
negative
true
said
dodson
i
dare
say
you
have
been
annoyed
in
the
fleet
there
are
some
odd
gentry
there
whereabouts
were
your
apartments
pickwick
my
one
room
replied
that
gentleman
was
on
the
room
oh
indeed
said
dodson
i
believe
that
is
a
very
pleasant
part
of
the
very
replied
pickwick
drily
there
was
a
coolness
about
all
this
which
to
a
gentleman
of
an
excitable
temperament
had
under
the
circumstances
rather
an
exasperating
tendency
pickwick
restrained
his
wrath
by
gigantic
efforts
but
when
perker
wrote
a
cheque
for
the
whole
amount
and
fogg
deposited
it
in
a
small
with
a
triumphant
smile
playing
over
his
pimply
features
which
communicated
itself
likewise
to
the
stern
countenance
of
dodson
he
felt
the
blood
in
his
cheeks
tingling
with
indignation
now
dodson
said
fogg
putting
up
the
and
drawing
on
his
gloves
i
am
at
your
very
good
said
dodson
rising
i
am
quite
i
am
very
happy
said
fogg
softened
by
the
cheque
to
have
had
the
pleasure
of
making
pickwick
s
acquaintance
i
hope
you
don
t
think
quite
so
ill
of
us
pickwick
as
when
we
first
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
i
hope
not
said
dodson
with
the
high
tone
of
calumniated
virtue
mr
pickwick
now
knows
us
better
i
trust
whatever
your
opinion
of
gentlemen
of
our
profession
may
be
i
beg
to
assure
you
sir
that
i
bear
no
or
vindictive
feeling
towards
you
for
the
sentiments
you
thought
proper
to
express
in
our
office
in
freeman
s
court
cornhill
on
the
occasion
to
which
my
partner
has
oh
no
no
nor
i
said
fogg
in
a
most
forgiving
manner
our
conduct
sir
said
dodson
will
speak
for
itself
and
justify
itself
i
hope
upon
every
occasion
we
have
been
in
the
profession
some
years
pickwick
and
have
been
honoured
with
the
confidence
of
many
excellent
clients
i
wish
you
pickwick
said
fogg
so
saying
he
put
his
umbrella
under
his
arm
drew
off
his
right
glove
and
extended
the
hand
of
reconciliation
to
that
most
indignant
gentleman
who
thereupon
thrust
his
hands
beneath
his
coat
tails
and
eyed
the
attorney
with
looks
of
scornful
amazement
lowten
cried
perker
at
this
moment
open
the
wait
one
instant
said
pickwick
perker
i
my
dear
sir
pray
let
the
matter
rest
where
it
is
said
the
little
attorney
who
had
been
in
a
state
of
nervous
apprehension
during
the
whole
interview
mr
pickwick
i
beg
i
will
not
be
put
down
sir
replied
pickwick
hastily
mr
dodson
you
have
addressed
some
remarks
to
dodson
turned
round
bent
his
head
meekly
and
smiled
some
remarks
to
me
repeated
pickwick
almost
breathless
and
your
partner
has
tendered
me
his
hand
and
you
have
both
assumed
a
tone
of
forgiveness
and
which
is
an
extent
of
impudence
that
i
was
not
prepared
for
even
in
what
sir
exclaimed
dodson
what
sir
reiterated
fogg
do
you
know
that
i
have
been
the
victim
of
your
plots
and
conspiracies
continued
pickwick
do
you
know
that
i
am
the
man
whom
you
have
been
imprisoning
and
robbing
do
you
know
that
you
were
the
attorneys
for
the
plaintiff
in
bardell
and
pickwick
yes
sir
we
do
know
it
replied
dodson
of
course
we
know
it
sir
rejoined
fogg
slapping
his
pocket
perhaps
by
accident
i
see
that
you
recollect
it
with
satisfaction
said
pickwick
attempting
to
call
up
a
sneer
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
and
failing
most
signally
in
so
doing
although
i
have
long
been
anxious
to
tell
you
in
plain
terms
what
my
opinion
of
you
is
i
should
have
let
even
this
opportunity
pass
in
deference
to
my
friend
perker
s
wishes
but
for
the
unwarrantable
tone
you
have
assumed
and
your
insolent
familiarity
i
say
insolent
familiarity
sir
said
pickwick
turning
upon
fogg
with
a
fierceness
of
gesture
which
caused
that
person
to
retreat
towards
the
door
with
great
expedition
take
care
sir
said
dodson
who
though
he
was
the
biggest
man
of
the
party
had
prudently
entrenched
himself
behind
fogg
and
was
speaking
over
his
head
with
a
very
pale
face
let
him
assault
you
fogg
don
t
return
it
on
any
no
no
i
won
t
return
it
said
fogg
falling
back
a
little
more
as
he
spoke
to
the
evident
relief
of
his
partner
who
by
these
means
was
gradually
getting
into
the
outer
office
you
are
continued
pickwick
resuming
the
thread
of
his
you
are
a
pair
of
mean
rascally
pettifogging
well
interposed
perker
is
that
all
it
is
all
summed
up
in
that
rejoined
pickwick
they
are
mean
rascally
pettifogging
there
said
perker
in
a
most
conciliatory
tone
my
dear
sirs
he
has
said
all
he
has
to
say
now
pray
go
lowten
is
that
door
open
lowten
with
a
distant
giggle
replied
in
the
affirmative
there
there
now
pray
my
dear
sirs
lowten
the
door
cried
the
little
man
pushing
dodson
fogg
nothing
loath
out
of
the
office
this
way
my
dear
sirs
now
pray
don
t
prolong
this
dear
me
lowten
the
door
sir
why
don
t
you
attend
if
there
s
law
in
england
sir
said
dodson
looking
towards
pickwick
as
he
put
on
his
hat
you
shall
smart
for
you
are
a
couple
of
mean
remember
sir
you
pay
dearly
for
this
said
fogg
rascally
pettifogging
robbers
continued
pickwick
taking
not
the
least
notice
of
the
threats
that
were
addressed
to
him
robbers
cried
pickwick
running
to
the
as
the
two
attorneys
descended
robbers
shouted
pickwick
breaking
from
lowten
and
perker
and
thrusting
his
head
out
of
the
staircase
window
when
pickwick
drew
in
his
head
again
his
countenance
was
smiling
and
placid
and
walking
quietly
back
into
the
office
he
declared
that
he
had
now
removed
a
great
weight
from
his
mind
and
that
he
felt
perfectly
comfortable
and
happy
perker
said
nothing
at
all
until
he
had
emptied
his
and
sent
lowten
out
to
fill
it
when
he
was
seized
with
a
fit
of
laughing
which
lasted
five
minutes
at
the
expiration
of
which
time
he
said
that
he
supposed
he
ought
to
be
very
angry
but
he
couldn
t
think
of
the
business
seriously
yet
when
he
could
he
would
be
well
now
said
pickwick
let
me
have
a
settlement
with
of
the
same
kind
as
the
last
inquired
perker
with
another
laugh
not
exactly
rejoined
pickwick
drawing
out
his
and
shaking
the
little
man
heartily
by
the
hand
i
only
mean
a
pecuniary
settlement
you
have
done
me
many
acts
of
kindness
that
i
can
never
repay
and
have
no
wish
to
repay
for
i
prefer
continuing
the
with
this
preface
the
two
friends
dived
into
some
very
complicated
accounts
and
vouchers
which
having
been
duly
displayed
and
gone
through
by
perker
were
at
once
discharged
by
pickwick
with
many
professions
of
esteem
and
friendship
they
had
no
sooner
arrived
at
this
point
than
a
most
violent
and
startling
knocking
was
heard
at
the
door
it
was
not
an
ordinary
knock
but
a
constant
and
uninterrupted
succession
of
the
loudest
single
raps
as
if
the
knocker
were
endowed
with
the
perpetual
motion
or
the
person
outside
had
forgotten
to
leave
off
dear
me
what
s
that
exclaimed
perker
starting
i
think
it
is
a
knock
at
the
door
said
pickwick
as
if
there
could
be
the
smallest
doubt
of
the
fact
the
knocker
made
a
more
energetic
reply
than
words
could
have
yielded
for
it
continued
to
hammer
with
surprising
force
and
noise
without
a
moment
s
cessation
dear
me
said
perker
ringing
his
bell
we
shall
alarm
the
inn
lowten
don
t
you
hear
a
knock
i
ll
answer
the
door
in
one
moment
sir
replied
the
clerk
the
knocker
appeared
to
hear
the
response
and
to
assert
that
it
was
quite
impossible
he
could
wait
so
long
it
made
a
stupendous
uproar
it
s
quite
dreadful
said
pickwick
stopping
his
ears
make
haste
lowten
perker
called
out
we
shall
have
the
panels
beaten
lowten
who
was
washing
his
hands
in
a
dark
closet
hurried
to
the
door
and
turning
the
handle
beheld
the
appearance
which
is
described
in
the
next
chapter
chapter
liv
containing
some
particulars
relative
to
the
double
knock
and
other
matters
among
which
certain
interesting
disclosures
relative
to
snodgrass
and
a
young
lady
are
by
no
means
irrelevant
to
this
history
the
object
that
presented
itself
to
the
eyes
of
the
astonished
clerk
was
a
boy
a
wonderfully
fat
boy
habited
as
a
serving
lad
standing
upright
on
the
mat
with
his
eyes
closed
as
if
in
sleep
he
had
never
seen
such
a
fat
boy
in
or
out
of
a
travelling
caravan
and
this
coupled
with
the
calmness
and
repose
of
his
appearance
so
very
different
from
what
was
reasonably
to
have
been
expected
of
the
inflicter
of
such
knocks
smote
him
with
wonder
what
s
the
matter
inquired
the
clerk
the
extraordinary
boy
replied
not
a
word
but
he
nodded
once
and
seemed
to
the
clerk
s
imagination
to
snore
feebly
where
do
you
come
from
inquired
the
clerk
the
boy
made
no
sign
he
breathed
heavily
but
in
all
other
respects
was
motionless
the
clerk
repeated
the
question
thrice
and
receiving
no
answer
prepared
to
shut
the
door
when
the
boy
suddenly
opened
his
eyes
winked
several
times
sneezed
once
and
raised
his
hand
as
if
to
repeat
the
knocking
finding
the
door
open
he
stared
about
him
with
astonishment
and
at
length
fixed
his
eyes
on
lowten
s
face
what
the
devil
do
you
knock
in
that
way
for
inquired
the
clerk
angrily
which
way
said
the
boy
in
a
slow
and
sleepy
voice
why
like
forty
replied
the
clerk
because
master
said
i
wasn
t
to
leave
off
knocking
till
they
opened
the
door
for
fear
i
should
go
to
sleep
said
the
boy
well
said
the
clerk
what
message
have
you
brought
he
s
downstairs
rejoined
the
boy
who
master
he
wants
to
know
whether
you
re
at
lowten
bethought
himself
at
this
juncture
of
looking
out
of
the
window
seeing
an
open
carriage
with
a
hearty
old
gentleman
in
it
looking
up
very
anxiously
he
ventured
to
beckon
him
on
which
the
old
gentleman
jumped
out
directly
that
s
your
master
in
the
carriage
i
suppose
said
lowten
the
boy
nodded
all
further
inquiries
were
superseded
by
the
appearance
of
old
wardle
who
running
upstairs
and
just
recognising
lowten
passed
at
once
into
perker
s
room
pickwick
said
the
old
gentleman
your
hand
my
boy
why
have
i
never
heard
until
the
day
before
yesterday
of
your
suffering
yourself
to
be
cooped
up
in
jail
and
why
did
you
let
him
do
it
perker
i
couldn
t
help
it
my
dear
sir
replied
perker
with
a
smile
and
a
pinch
of
snuff
you
know
how
obstinate
he
is
of
course
i
do
of
course
i
do
replied
the
old
gentleman
i
am
heartily
glad
to
see
him
notwithstanding
i
will
not
lose
sight
of
him
again
in
a
with
these
words
wardle
shook
pickwick
s
hand
once
more
and
having
done
the
same
by
perker
threw
himself
into
an
his
jolly
red
face
shining
again
with
smiles
and
health
well
said
wardle
here
are
pretty
goings
on
a
pinch
of
your
snuff
perker
my
boy
never
were
such
times
eh
what
do
you
mean
inquired
pickwick
mean
replied
wardle
why
i
think
the
girls
are
all
running
mad
that
s
no
news
you
ll
say
perhaps
it
s
not
but
it
s
true
for
all
you
have
not
come
up
to
london
of
all
places
in
the
world
to
tell
us
that
my
dear
sir
have
you
inquired
perker
no
not
altogether
replied
wardle
though
it
was
the
main
cause
of
my
coming
how
s
arabella
very
well
replied
pickwick
and
will
be
delighted
to
see
you
i
am
little
jilt
replied
wardle
i
had
a
great
idea
of
marrying
her
myself
one
of
these
odd
days
but
i
am
glad
of
it
too
very
how
did
the
intelligence
reach
you
asked
pickwick
oh
it
came
to
my
girls
of
course
replied
wardle
arabella
wrote
the
day
before
yesterday
to
say
she
had
made
a
stolen
match
without
her
husband
s
father
s
consent
and
so
you
had
gone
down
to
get
it
when
his
refusing
it
couldn
t
prevent
the
match
and
all
the
rest
of
it
i
thought
it
a
very
good
time
to
say
something
serious
to
my
girls
so
i
said
what
a
dreadful
thing
it
was
that
children
should
marry
without
their
parents
consent
and
so
forth
but
bless
your
hearts
i
couldn
t
make
the
least
impression
upon
them
they
thought
it
such
a
much
more
dreadful
thing
that
there
should
have
been
a
wedding
without
bridesmaids
that
i
might
as
well
have
preached
to
joe
here
the
old
gentleman
stopped
to
laugh
and
having
done
so
to
his
heart
s
content
presently
resumed
but
this
is
not
the
best
of
it
it
seems
this
is
only
half
the
making
and
plotting
that
have
been
going
forward
we
have
been
walking
on
mines
for
the
last
six
months
and
they
re
sprung
at
what
do
you
mean
exclaimed
pickwick
turning
pale
no
other
secret
marriage
i
hope
no
no
replied
old
wardle
not
so
bad
as
that
what
then
inquired
pickwick
am
i
interested
in
it
shall
i
answer
that
question
perker
said
wardle
if
you
don
t
commit
yourself
by
doing
so
my
dear
well
then
you
are
said
wardle
how
asked
pickwick
anxiously
in
what
way
really
replied
wardle
you
re
such
a
fiery
sort
of
a
young
fellow
that
i
am
almost
afraid
to
tell
you
but
however
if
perker
will
sit
between
us
to
prevent
mischief
i
ll
having
closed
the
room
door
and
fortified
himself
with
another
application
to
perker
s
the
old
gentleman
proceeded
with
his
great
disclosure
in
these
words
the
fact
is
that
my
daughter
bella
bella
who
married
young
trundle
you
yes
yes
we
know
said
pickwick
impatiently
don
t
alarm
me
at
the
very
beginning
my
daughter
bella
emily
having
gone
to
bed
with
a
headache
after
she
had
read
arabella
s
letter
to
me
sat
herself
down
by
my
side
the
other
evening
and
began
to
talk
over
this
marriage
affair
well
pa
she
says
what
do
you
think
of
it
why
my
dear
i
said
i
suppose
it
s
all
very
well
i
hope
it
s
for
the
i
answered
in
this
way
because
i
was
sitting
before
the
fire
at
the
time
drinking
my
grog
rather
thoughtfully
and
i
knew
my
throwing
in
an
undecided
word
now
and
then
would
induce
her
to
continue
talking
both
my
girls
are
pictures
of
their
dear
mother
and
as
i
grow
old
i
like
to
sit
with
only
them
by
me
for
their
voices
and
looks
carry
me
back
to
the
happiest
period
of
my
life
and
make
me
for
the
moment
as
young
as
i
used
to
be
then
though
not
quite
so
it
s
quite
a
marriage
of
affection
pa
said
bella
after
a
short
silence
yes
my
dear
said
i
but
such
marriages
do
not
always
turn
out
the
i
question
that
mind
interposed
pickwick
warmly
very
good
responded
wardle
question
anything
you
like
when
it
s
your
turn
to
speak
but
don
t
interrupt
i
beg
your
pardon
said
pickwick
granted
replied
wardle
i
am
sorry
to
hear
you
express
your
opinion
against
marriages
of
affection
pa
said
bella
colouring
a
little
i
was
wrong
i
ought
not
to
have
said
so
my
dear
either
said
i
patting
her
cheek
as
kindly
as
a
rough
old
fellow
like
me
could
pat
it
for
your
mother
s
was
one
and
so
was
it
s
not
that
i
meant
pa
said
bella
the
fact
is
pa
i
wanted
to
speak
to
you
about
pickwick
started
what
s
the
matter
now
inquired
wardle
stopping
in
his
narrative
nothing
replied
pickwick
pray
go
i
never
could
spin
out
a
story
said
wardle
abruptly
it
must
come
out
sooner
or
later
and
it
ll
save
us
all
a
great
deal
of
time
if
it
comes
at
once
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
is
then
that
bella
at
last
mustered
up
courage
to
tell
me
that
emily
was
very
unhappy
that
she
and
your
young
friend
snodgrass
had
been
in
constant
correspondence
and
communication
ever
since
last
christmas
that
she
had
very
dutifully
made
up
her
mind
to
run
away
with
him
in
laudable
imitation
of
her
old
friend
and
but
that
having
some
compunctions
of
conscience
on
the
subject
inasmuch
as
i
had
always
been
rather
kindly
disposed
to
both
of
them
they
had
thought
it
better
in
the
first
instance
to
pay
me
the
compliment
of
asking
whether
i
would
have
any
objection
to
their
being
married
in
the
usual
manner
there
now
pickwick
if
you
can
make
it
convenient
to
reduce
your
eyes
to
their
usual
size
again
and
to
let
me
hear
what
you
think
we
ought
to
do
i
shall
feel
rather
obliged
to
you
the
testy
manner
in
which
the
hearty
old
gentleman
uttered
this
last
sentence
was
not
wholly
unwarranted
for
pickwick
s
face
had
settled
down
into
an
expression
of
blank
amazement
and
perplexity
quite
curious
to
behold
snodgrass
since
last
christmas
were
the
first
broken
words
that
issued
from
the
lips
of
the
confounded
gentleman
since
last
christmas
replied
wardle
that
s
plain
enough
and
very
bad
spectacles
we
must
have
worn
not
to
have
discovered
it
i
don
t
understand
it
said
pickwick
ruminating
i
can
not
really
understand
it
s
easy
enough
to
understand
it
replied
the
choleric
old
gentleman
if
you
had
been
a
younger
man
you
would
have
been
in
the
secret
long
ago
and
besides
added
wardle
after
a
moment
s
hesitation
the
truth
is
that
knowing
nothing
of
this
matter
i
have
rather
pressed
emily
for
four
or
five
months
past
to
receive
favourably
if
she
could
i
would
never
attempt
to
force
a
girl
s
inclinations
the
addresses
of
a
young
gentleman
down
in
our
neighbourhood
i
have
no
doubt
that
like
to
enhance
her
own
value
and
increase
the
ardour
of
snodgrass
she
has
represented
this
matter
in
very
glowing
colours
and
that
they
have
both
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
they
are
a
pair
of
unfortunates
and
have
no
resource
but
clandestine
matrimony
or
charcoal
now
the
question
is
what
s
to
be
done
what
have
inquired
pickwick
i
mean
what
did
you
do
when
your
married
daughter
told
you
this
oh
i
made
a
fool
of
myself
of
course
rejoined
wardle
just
so
interposed
perker
who
had
accompanied
this
dialogue
with
sundry
twitchings
of
his
vindictive
rubbings
of
his
nose
and
other
symptoms
of
impatience
that
s
very
natural
but
how
i
went
into
a
great
passion
and
frightened
my
mother
into
a
fit
said
wardle
that
was
judicious
remarked
perker
and
what
else
i
fretted
and
fumed
all
next
day
and
raised
a
great
disturbance
rejoined
the
old
gentleman
at
last
i
got
tired
of
rendering
myself
unpleasant
and
making
everybody
miserable
so
i
hired
a
carriage
at
muggleton
and
putting
my
own
horses
in
it
came
up
to
town
under
pretence
of
bringing
emily
to
see
miss
wardle
is
with
you
then
said
pickwick
to
be
sure
she
is
replied
wardle
she
is
at
osborne
s
hotel
in
the
adelphi
at
this
moment
unless
your
enterprising
friend
has
run
away
with
her
since
i
came
out
this
you
are
reconciled
then
said
perker
not
a
bit
of
it
answered
wardle
she
has
been
crying
and
moping
ever
since
except
last
night
between
tea
and
supper
when
she
made
a
great
parade
of
writing
a
letter
that
i
pretended
to
take
no
notice
you
want
my
advice
in
this
matter
i
suppose
said
perker
looking
from
the
musing
face
of
pickwick
to
the
eager
countenance
of
wardle
and
taking
several
consecutive
pinches
of
his
favourite
stimulant
i
suppose
so
said
wardle
looking
at
pickwick
certainly
replied
that
gentleman
well
then
said
perker
rising
and
pushing
his
chair
back
my
advice
is
that
you
both
walk
away
together
or
ride
away
or
get
away
by
some
means
or
other
for
i
m
tired
of
you
and
just
talk
this
matter
over
between
you
if
you
have
not
settled
it
by
the
next
time
i
see
you
i
ll
tell
you
what
to
this
is
satisfactory
said
wardle
hardly
knowing
whether
to
smile
or
be
offended
pooh
pooh
my
dear
sir
returned
perker
i
know
you
both
a
great
deal
better
than
you
know
yourselves
you
have
settled
it
already
to
all
intents
and
thus
expressing
himself
the
little
gentleman
poked
his
first
into
the
chest
of
pickwick
and
then
into
the
waistcoat
of
wardle
upon
which
they
all
three
laughed
especially
the
two
gentlemen
who
at
once
shook
hands
again
without
any
obvious
or
particular
reason
you
dine
with
me
said
wardle
to
perker
as
he
showed
them
out
can
t
promise
my
dear
sir
can
t
promise
replied
perker
i
ll
look
in
in
the
evening
at
all
i
shall
expect
you
at
five
said
wardle
now
joe
and
joe
having
been
at
length
awakened
the
two
friends
departed
in
wardle
s
carriage
which
in
common
humanity
had
a
dickey
behind
for
the
fat
boy
who
if
there
had
been
a
footboard
instead
would
have
rolled
off
and
killed
himself
in
his
very
first
nap
driving
to
the
george
and
vulture
they
found
that
arabella
and
her
maid
had
sent
for
a
immediately
on
the
receipt
of
a
short
note
from
emily
announcing
her
arrival
in
town
and
had
proceeded
straight
to
the
adelphi
as
wardle
had
business
to
transact
in
the
city
they
sent
the
carriage
and
the
fat
boy
to
his
hotel
with
the
information
that
he
and
pickwick
would
return
together
to
dinner
at
five
o
clock
charged
with
this
message
the
fat
boy
returned
slumbering
as
peaceably
in
his
dickey
over
the
stones
as
if
it
had
been
a
down
bed
on
watch
springs
by
some
extraordinary
miracle
he
awoke
of
his
own
accord
when
the
coach
stopped
and
giving
himself
a
good
shake
to
stir
up
his
faculties
went
upstairs
to
execute
his
commission
now
whether
the
shake
had
jumbled
the
fat
boy
s
faculties
together
instead
of
arranging
them
in
proper
order
or
had
roused
such
a
quantity
of
new
ideas
within
him
as
to
render
him
oblivious
of
ordinary
forms
and
ceremonies
or
which
is
also
possible
had
proved
unsuccessful
in
preventing
his
falling
asleep
as
he
ascended
the
stairs
it
is
an
undoubted
fact
that
he
walked
into
the
without
previously
knocking
at
the
door
and
so
beheld
a
gentleman
with
his
arms
clasping
his
young
mistress
s
waist
sitting
very
lovingly
by
her
side
on
a
sofa
while
arabella
and
her
pretty
handmaid
feigned
to
be
absorbed
in
looking
out
of
a
window
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
at
the
sight
of
this
phenomenon
the
fat
boy
uttered
an
interjection
the
ladies
a
scream
and
the
gentleman
an
oath
almost
simultaneously
wretched
creature
what
do
you
want
here
said
the
gentleman
who
it
is
needless
to
say
was
snodgrass
to
this
the
fat
boy
considerably
terrified
briefly
responded
what
do
you
want
me
for
inquired
emily
turning
her
head
aside
you
stupid
creature
master
and
pickwick
is
to
dine
here
at
five
replied
the
fat
boy
leave
the
room
said
snodgrass
glaring
upon
the
bewildered
youth
no
no
no
added
emily
hastily
bella
dear
advise
upon
this
emily
and
snodgrass
and
arabella
and
mary
crowded
into
a
corner
and
conversed
earnestly
in
whispers
for
some
minutes
during
which
the
fat
boy
dozed
joe
said
arabella
at
length
looking
round
with
a
most
bewitching
smile
how
do
you
do
joe
joe
said
emily
you
re
a
very
good
boy
i
won
t
forget
you
joe
said
snodgrass
advancing
to
the
astonished
youth
and
seizing
his
hand
i
didn
t
know
you
before
there
s
five
shillings
for
you
joe
i
ll
owe
you
five
joe
said
arabella
for
old
acquaintance
sake
you
know
and
another
most
captivating
smile
was
bestowed
upon
the
corpulent
intruder
the
fat
boy
s
perception
being
slow
he
looked
rather
puzzled
at
first
to
account
for
this
sudden
prepossession
in
his
favour
and
stared
about
him
in
a
very
alarming
manner
at
length
his
broad
face
began
to
show
symptoms
of
a
grin
of
proportionately
broad
dimensions
and
then
thrusting
into
each
of
his
pockets
and
a
hand
and
wrist
after
it
he
burst
into
a
horse
laugh
being
for
the
first
and
only
time
in
his
existence
he
understands
us
i
see
said
arabella
he
had
better
have
something
to
eat
immediately
remarked
emily
the
fat
boy
almost
laughed
again
when
he
heard
this
suggestion
mary
after
a
little
more
whispering
tripped
forth
from
the
group
and
said
i
am
going
to
dine
with
you
sir
if
you
have
no
this
way
said
the
fat
boy
eagerly
there
is
such
a
jolly
with
these
words
the
fat
boy
led
the
way
downstairs
his
pretty
companion
captivating
all
the
waiters
and
angering
all
the
chambermaids
as
she
followed
him
to
the
there
was
the
of
which
the
youth
had
spoken
so
feelingly
and
there
were
moreover
a
steak
and
a
dish
of
potatoes
and
a
pot
of
porter
sit
down
said
the
fat
boy
oh
my
eye
how
prime
i
am
having
apostrophised
his
eye
in
a
species
of
rapture
five
or
six
times
the
youth
took
the
head
of
the
little
table
and
mary
seated
herself
at
the
bottom
will
you
have
some
of
this
said
the
fat
boy
plunging
into
the
pie
up
to
the
very
ferules
of
the
knife
and
fork
a
little
if
you
please
replied
mary
the
fat
boy
assisted
mary
to
a
little
and
himself
to
a
great
deal
and
was
just
going
to
begin
eating
when
he
suddenly
laid
down
his
knife
and
fork
leaned
forward
in
his
chair
and
letting
his
hands
with
the
knife
and
fork
in
them
fall
on
his
knees
said
very
slowly
i
say
how
nice
you
look
this
was
said
in
an
admiring
manner
and
was
so
far
gratifying
but
still
there
was
enough
of
the
cannibal
in
the
young
gentleman
s
eyes
to
render
the
compliment
a
double
one
dear
me
joseph
said
mary
affecting
to
blush
what
do
you
mean
the
fat
boy
gradually
recovering
his
former
position
replied
with
a
heavy
sigh
and
remaining
thoughtful
for
a
few
moments
drank
a
long
draught
of
the
porter
having
achieved
this
feat
he
sighed
again
and
applied
himself
assiduously
to
the
pie
what
a
nice
young
lady
miss
emily
is
said
mary
after
a
long
silence
the
fat
boy
had
by
this
time
finished
the
pie
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
mary
and
replied
i
knows
a
indeed
said
mary
yes
indeed
replied
the
fat
boy
with
unwonted
vivacity
what
s
her
name
inquired
mary
what
s
yours
so
s
hers
said
the
fat
boy
you
re
the
boy
grinned
to
add
point
to
the
compliment
and
put
his
eyes
into
something
between
a
squint
and
a
cast
which
there
is
reason
to
believe
he
intended
for
an
ogle
you
mustn
t
talk
to
me
in
that
way
said
mary
you
don
t
mean
don
t
i
though
replied
the
fat
boy
i
say
well
are
you
going
to
come
here
regular
no
rejoined
mary
shaking
her
head
i
m
going
away
again
why
oh
said
the
fat
boy
in
a
tone
of
strong
feeling
how
we
should
have
enjoyed
ourselves
at
meals
if
you
had
been
i
might
come
here
sometimes
perhaps
to
see
you
said
mary
plaiting
the
in
assumed
coyness
if
you
would
do
me
a
the
fat
boy
looked
from
the
to
the
steak
as
if
he
thought
a
favour
must
be
in
a
manner
connected
with
something
to
eat
and
then
took
out
one
of
the
and
glanced
at
it
nervously
don
t
you
understand
me
said
mary
looking
slily
in
his
fat
face
again
he
looked
at
the
and
said
faintly
the
ladies
want
you
not
to
say
anything
to
the
old
gentleman
about
the
young
gentleman
having
been
upstairs
and
i
want
you
is
that
all
said
the
fat
boy
evidently
very
much
relieved
as
he
pocketed
the
again
of
course
i
ain
t
you
see
said
mary
mr
snodgrass
is
very
fond
of
miss
emily
and
miss
emily
s
very
fond
of
him
and
if
you
were
to
tell
about
it
the
old
gentleman
would
carry
you
all
away
miles
into
the
country
where
you
d
see
no
no
i
won
t
tell
said
the
fat
boy
stoutly
that
s
a
dear
said
mary
now
it
s
time
i
went
upstairs
and
got
my
lady
ready
for
don
t
go
yet
urged
the
fat
boy
i
must
replied
mary
for
the
the
fat
boy
with
elephantine
playfulness
stretched
out
his
arms
to
ravish
a
kiss
but
as
it
required
no
great
agility
to
elude
him
his
fair
enslaver
had
vanished
before
he
closed
them
again
upon
which
the
apathetic
youth
ate
a
pound
or
so
of
steak
with
a
sentimental
countenance
and
fell
fast
asleep
there
was
so
much
to
say
upstairs
and
there
were
so
many
plans
to
concert
for
elopement
and
matrimony
in
the
event
of
old
wardle
continuing
to
be
cruel
that
it
wanted
only
half
an
hour
of
dinner
when
snodgrass
took
his
final
adieu
the
ladies
ran
to
emily
s
bedroom
to
dress
and
the
lover
taking
up
his
hat
walked
out
of
the
room
he
had
scarcely
got
outside
the
door
when
he
heard
wardle
s
voice
talking
loudly
and
looking
over
the
banisters
beheld
him
followed
by
some
other
gentlemen
coming
straight
upstairs
knowing
nothing
of
the
house
snodgrass
in
his
confusion
stepped
hastily
back
into
the
room
he
had
just
quitted
and
passing
thence
into
an
inner
apartment
wardle
s
bedchamber
closed
the
door
softly
just
as
the
persons
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
entered
the
these
were
wardle
pickwick
nathaniel
winkle
and
benjamin
allen
whom
he
had
no
difficulty
in
recognising
by
their
voices
very
lucky
i
had
the
presence
of
mind
to
avoid
them
thought
snodgrass
with
a
smile
and
walking
on
tiptoe
to
another
door
near
the
bedside
this
opens
into
the
same
passage
and
i
can
walk
quietly
and
comfortably
there
was
only
one
obstacle
to
his
walking
quietly
and
comfortably
away
which
was
that
the
door
was
locked
and
the
key
gone
let
us
have
some
of
your
best
wine
waiter
said
old
wardle
rubbing
his
hands
you
shall
have
some
of
the
very
best
sir
replied
the
waiter
let
the
ladies
know
we
have
come
yes
devoutly
and
ardently
did
snodgrass
wish
that
the
ladies
could
know
he
had
come
in
he
ventured
once
to
whisper
waiter
through
the
keyhole
but
the
probability
of
the
wrong
waiter
coming
to
his
relief
flashed
upon
his
mind
together
with
a
sense
of
the
strong
resemblance
between
his
own
situation
and
that
in
which
another
gentleman
had
been
recently
found
in
a
neighbouring
hotel
an
account
of
whose
misfortunes
had
appeared
under
the
head
of
police
in
that
morning
s
paper
he
sat
himself
on
a
portmanteau
and
trembled
violently
we
won
t
wait
a
minute
for
perker
said
wardle
looking
at
his
watch
he
is
always
exact
he
will
be
here
in
time
if
he
means
to
come
and
if
he
does
not
it
s
of
no
use
waiting
ha
arabella
my
sister
exclaimed
benjamin
allen
folding
her
in
a
most
romantic
embrace
oh
ben
dear
how
you
do
smell
of
tobacco
said
arabella
rather
overcome
by
this
mark
of
affection
do
i
said
benjamin
allen
do
i
bella
well
perhaps
i
perhaps
he
did
having
just
left
a
pleasant
little
of
twelve
medical
students
in
a
small
back
parlour
with
a
large
fire
but
i
am
delighted
to
see
you
said
ben
allen
bless
you
bella
there
said
arabella
bending
forward
to
kiss
her
brother
don
t
take
hold
of
me
again
ben
dear
because
you
tumble
me
at
this
point
of
the
reconciliation
ben
allen
allowed
his
feelings
and
the
cigars
and
porter
to
overcome
him
and
looked
round
upon
the
beholders
with
damp
spectacles
is
nothing
to
be
said
to
me
cried
wardle
with
open
arms
a
great
deal
whispered
arabella
as
she
received
the
old
gentleman
s
hearty
caress
and
congratulation
you
are
a
unfeeling
cruel
you
are
a
little
rebel
replied
wardle
in
the
same
tone
and
i
am
afraid
i
shall
be
obliged
to
forbid
you
the
house
people
like
you
who
get
married
in
spite
of
everybody
ought
not
to
be
let
loose
on
society
but
come
added
the
old
gentleman
aloud
here
s
the
dinner
you
shall
sit
by
me
joe
why
damn
the
boy
he
s
awake
to
the
great
distress
of
his
master
the
fat
boy
was
indeed
in
a
state
of
remarkable
vigilance
his
eyes
being
wide
open
and
looking
as
if
they
intended
to
remain
so
there
was
an
alacrity
in
his
manner
too
which
was
equally
unaccountable
every
time
his
eyes
met
those
of
emily
or
arabella
he
smirked
and
grinned
once
wardle
could
have
sworn
he
saw
him
wink
this
alteration
in
the
fat
boy
s
demeanour
originated
in
his
increased
sense
of
his
own
importance
and
the
dignity
he
acquired
from
having
been
taken
into
the
confidence
of
the
young
ladies
and
the
smirks
and
grins
and
winks
were
so
many
condescending
assurances
that
they
might
depend
upon
his
fidelity
as
these
tokens
were
rather
calculated
to
awaken
suspicion
than
allay
it
and
were
somewhat
embarrassing
besides
they
were
occasionally
answered
by
a
frown
or
shake
of
the
head
from
arabella
which
the
fat
boy
considering
as
hints
to
be
on
his
guard
expressed
his
perfect
understanding
of
by
smirking
grinning
and
winking
with
redoubled
assiduity
joe
said
wardle
after
an
unsuccessful
search
in
all
his
pockets
is
my
on
the
sofa
no
sir
replied
the
fat
boy
oh
i
recollect
i
left
it
on
my
this
morning
said
wardle
run
into
the
next
room
and
fetch
the
fat
boy
went
into
the
next
room
and
having
been
absent
about
a
minute
returned
with
the
and
the
palest
face
that
ever
a
fat
boy
wore
what
s
the
matter
with
the
boy
exclaimed
wardle
nothen
s
the
matter
with
me
replied
joe
nervously
have
you
been
seeing
any
spirits
inquired
the
old
gentleman
or
taking
any
added
ben
allen
i
think
you
re
right
whispered
wardle
across
the
table
he
is
intoxicated
i
m
ben
allen
replied
that
he
thought
he
was
and
as
that
gentleman
had
seen
a
vast
deal
of
the
disease
in
question
wardle
was
confirmed
in
an
impression
which
had
been
hovering
about
his
mind
for
half
an
hour
and
at
once
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
the
fat
boy
was
drunk
just
keep
your
eye
upon
him
for
a
few
minutes
murmured
wardle
we
shall
soon
find
out
whether
he
is
or
the
unfortunate
youth
had
only
interchanged
a
dozen
words
with
snodgrass
that
gentleman
having
implored
him
to
make
a
private
appeal
to
some
friend
to
release
him
and
then
pushed
him
out
with
the
box
lest
his
prolonged
absence
should
lead
to
a
discovery
he
ruminated
a
little
with
a
most
disturbed
expression
of
face
and
left
the
room
in
search
of
mary
but
mary
had
gone
home
after
dressing
her
mistress
and
the
fat
boy
came
back
again
more
disturbed
than
before
wardle
and
ben
allen
exchanged
glances
joe
said
wardle
yes
what
did
you
go
away
for
the
fat
boy
looked
hopelessly
in
the
face
of
everybody
at
table
and
stammered
out
that
he
didn
t
know
oh
said
wardle
you
don
t
know
eh
take
this
cheese
to
now
pickwick
being
in
the
very
best
health
and
spirits
had
been
making
himself
perfectly
delightful
all
and
was
at
this
moment
engaged
in
an
energetic
conversation
with
emily
and
winkle
bowing
his
head
courteously
in
the
emphasis
of
his
discourse
gently
waving
his
left
hand
to
lend
force
to
his
observations
and
all
glowing
with
placid
smiles
he
took
a
piece
of
cheese
from
the
plate
and
was
on
the
point
of
turning
round
to
renew
the
conversation
when
the
fat
boy
stooping
so
as
to
bring
his
head
on
a
level
with
that
of
pickwick
pointed
with
his
thumb
over
his
shoulder
and
made
the
most
horrible
and
hideous
face
that
was
ever
seen
out
of
a
christmas
pantomime
dear
me
said
pickwick
starting
what
a
very
eh
he
stopped
for
the
fat
boy
had
drawn
himself
up
and
was
or
pretended
to
be
fast
asleep
what
s
the
matter
inquired
wardle
this
is
such
an
extremely
singular
lad
replied
pickwick
looking
uneasily
at
the
boy
it
seems
an
odd
thing
to
say
but
upon
my
word
i
am
afraid
that
at
times
he
is
a
little
oh
pickwick
pray
don
t
say
so
cried
emily
and
arabella
both
at
once
i
am
not
certain
of
course
said
pickwick
amidst
profound
silence
and
looks
of
general
dismay
but
his
manner
to
me
this
moment
really
was
very
alarming
oh
ejaculated
pickwick
suddenly
jumping
up
with
a
short
scream
i
beg
your
pardon
ladies
but
at
that
moment
he
ran
some
sharp
instrument
into
my
leg
really
he
is
not
he
s
drunk
roared
old
wardle
passionately
ring
the
bell
call
the
waiters
he
s
i
ain
t
said
the
fat
boy
falling
on
his
knees
as
his
master
seized
him
by
the
collar
i
ain
t
then
you
re
mad
that
s
worse
call
the
waiters
said
the
old
gentleman
i
ain
t
mad
i
m
sensible
rejoined
the
fat
boy
beginning
to
cry
then
what
the
devil
did
you
run
sharp
instruments
into
pickwick
s
legs
for
inquired
wardle
angrily
he
wouldn
t
look
at
me
replied
the
boy
i
wanted
to
speak
to
what
did
you
want
to
say
asked
half
a
dozen
voices
at
once
the
fat
boy
gasped
looked
at
the
bedroom
door
gasped
again
and
wiped
two
tears
away
with
the
knuckle
of
each
of
his
forefingers
what
did
you
want
to
say
demanded
wardle
shaking
him
stop
said
pickwick
allow
me
what
did
you
wish
to
communicate
to
me
my
poor
boy
i
want
to
whisper
to
you
replied
the
fat
boy
you
want
to
bite
his
ear
off
i
suppose
said
wardle
don
t
come
near
him
he
s
vicious
ring
the
bell
and
let
him
be
taken
just
as
winkle
caught
the
in
his
hand
it
was
arrested
by
a
general
expression
of
astonishment
the
captive
lover
his
face
burning
with
confusion
suddenly
walked
in
from
the
bedroom
and
made
a
comprehensive
bow
to
the
company
hollo
cried
wardle
releasing
the
fat
boy
s
collar
and
staggering
back
what
s
this
i
have
been
concealed
in
the
next
room
sir
since
you
returned
explained
snodgrass
emily
my
girl
said
wardle
reproachfully
i
detest
meanness
and
deceit
this
is
unjustifiable
and
indelicate
in
the
highest
degree
i
don
t
deserve
this
at
your
hands
emily
indeed
dear
papa
said
emily
arabella
knows
everybody
here
knows
joe
knows
that
i
was
no
party
to
this
concealment
augustus
for
heaven
s
sake
explain
it
snodgrass
who
had
only
waited
for
a
hearing
at
once
recounted
how
he
had
been
placed
in
his
then
distressing
predicament
how
the
fear
of
giving
rise
to
domestic
dissensions
had
alone
prompted
him
to
avoid
wardle
on
his
entrance
how
he
merely
meant
to
depart
by
another
door
but
finding
it
locked
had
been
compelled
to
stay
against
his
will
it
was
a
painful
situation
to
be
placed
in
but
he
now
regretted
it
the
less
inasmuch
as
it
afforded
him
an
opportunity
of
acknowledging
before
their
mutual
friends
that
he
loved
wardle
s
daughter
deeply
and
sincerely
that
he
was
proud
to
avow
that
the
feeling
was
mutual
and
that
if
thousands
of
miles
were
placed
between
them
or
oceans
rolled
their
waters
he
could
never
for
an
instant
forget
those
happy
days
when
first
et
cetera
et
cetera
having
delivered
himself
to
this
effect
snodgrass
bowed
again
looked
into
the
crown
of
his
hat
and
stepped
towards
the
door
stop
shouted
wardle
why
in
the
name
of
all
that
s
inflammable
mildly
suggested
pickwick
who
thought
something
worse
was
coming
well
that
s
inflammable
said
wardle
adopting
the
substitute
couldn
t
you
say
all
this
to
me
in
the
first
instance
or
confide
in
me
added
pickwick
dear
dear
said
arabella
taking
up
the
defence
what
is
the
use
of
asking
all
that
now
especially
when
you
know
you
had
set
your
covetous
old
heart
on
a
richer
and
are
so
wild
and
fierce
besides
that
everybody
is
afraid
of
you
except
me
shake
hands
with
him
and
order
him
some
dinner
for
goodness
gracious
sake
for
he
looks
half
starved
and
pray
have
your
wine
up
at
once
for
you

not
be
tolerable
until
you
have
taken
two
bottles

pulled
arabella
s
ear
kissed
her
without
the
smallest
scruple
kissed
his
daughter
also
with
great
affection
and
shook
snodgrass
warmly
by
the
hand

is
right
on
one
point

all

said
the
old
gentleman
cheerfully

for
the
wine
the
wine

and
perker
came
upstairs
at
the

moment
snodgrass
had
dinner
at
a
side
table
and
when
he
had
despatched

his
chair

his

so
dogmatically
that
sam

to

the
position

of
this
notable
resolution
the
services
of
the

of
two
other
very
fat
coachmen
selected
by
weller
probably
with
a
view
to
their
width
and
consequent
wisdom

put
into
requisition

this
assistance
having
been
secured
the

cold
collation
of
an
abernethy
biscuit
and
a

the
message
was
no
sooner
whispered
in
his
ear
than
he
thrust
them
in
his
pocket
among
various
professional
documents
and
hurried
over
the
way
with
such
alacrity
that
he
reached
the
parlour
before
the
messenger
had
even
emancipated
himself
from
the
court

up

the

when
he
came
out
from
hearing
appeals
in
the
house
of
lords
poor
fellow
he
was
very
susceptible
to
fatigue
he
used
to
feel
those
appeals
uncommonly
i
actually
thought
more
than
once
that
he
d
have
sunk
under

did
here
pell
shook
his
head
and
paused
on
which
the
elder
weller
nudging
his
neighbour
as
begging
him
to
mark
the
attorney

high
connections
asked
whether
the
duties
in

produced
any
permanent
ill
effects
on
the
constitution
of
his
noble
friend
i
don
t
think

quite
recovered
them

a

at

the
ceiling
and
the
rum
having
by
that
time
arrived
drank
it
up
however

pell
drawing
a
chair
to
the

a
professional
man

no
right
to

assistance

melancholy
pell

when
he
came
to
the
word
weep
but
he
made
no
further
use
of
it
than
to
wipe
away
a
slight
tinge
of
rum
which
hung
upon
his
upper
lip

pell

my
soul

apprehension
of

had
been
revolving
in

been
merely
invited
to

now
the

at

at

eager
for

his

glistened
as

laid

arranged
with
peculiar
care
the

at
his
a
dahlia
with
several
leaves
and
the
coats
of
his
two
friends
were
adorned
with
nosegays
of
laurel
and
other
evergreens
all
three
were
habited
in
strict
holiday
costume
that
is
to
say
they
were
wrapped
up
to
the
chins
and
wore
as
many
clothes
as

which

done
ample
justice
to
where
everybody
took
so
active
a
part
it
is
almost
invidious
to
make
a
distinction
but
if
one
individual
evinced
greater
powers
than
another
it
was
the
coachman
with
the
hoarse
voice
who
took
an
imperial
pint
of
vinegar
with
his
oysters
without
betraying
the
least
emotion

a

sudden
energy

on

saying
this
the
gentleman
rose
as
did
the
other
gentlemen
the
gentleman
reviewed
the
company
and
slowly
lifted
his
hand
upon
which
every
man
including
him
of
the
mottled
countenance
drew
a
long
breath
and
lifted
his
tumbler
to
his
lips
in
one
instant
the
gentleman
depressed
his
hand
again
and
every
glass
was
set
down
empty
it
is
impossible
to
describe
the
thrilling
effect
produced
by
this
striking
ceremony
at
once
dignified
solemn
and
impressive
it
combined
every
element
of
grandeur
well
gentlemen
said
pell
all
i
can
say
is
that
such
marks
of
confidence
must
be
very
gratifying
to
a
professional
man
i
don
t
wish
to
say
anything
that
might
appear
egotistical
gentlemen
but
i
m
very
glad
for
your

sakes
that
you
came
to
me
that
s
all
if
you
had
gone
to
any
low
member
of
the
profession
it
s
my
firm
conviction
and
i
assure
you
of
it
as
a
fact
that
you
would
have
found
yourselves
in
queer
street
before
this
i
could
have
wished
my
noble
friend
had
been
alive
to
have
seen
my
management
of
this
case
i
don
t
say
it
out
of
pride
but
i
think
however
gentlemen
i
won
t
trouble
you
with

generally
to

very
cheap

no

attends
more
to
his
clients
than
i
do
and
i
hope

a
little
of
my

any
opportunity
of
recommending
me

of

one

wafered

condescended
to
receive
solomon

and
having
filled
up
some
printed
forms
requested
the
party
to
follow
him
to
the
bank
which
they
did
weller
and
his
three
friends
staring
at
all
they
beheld
in
unbounded
astonishment
and
sam
encountering
everything
with
a
coolness
which
nothing
could
disturb
crossing
a
courtyard
which
was
all
noise
and
bustle
and
passing
a
couple
of
porters
who
seemed
dressed
to
match
the
red
fire
engine
which
was
wheeled
away
into
a
corner
they
passed
into
an
office
where
their
business
was
to
be
transacted
and
where
pell
and
flasher

them
standing
for
a
few
moments
while

all

long
weller
and
his
friends
had
scarcely
had
a
moment
to
reflect
upon
this
singular
regulation
as
connected
with
the
monetary
system
of
the
country
when
they
were
rejoined
by
pell
and
wilkins
flasher
esquire
who
led
them
to
a

of
the

their

opinion
that

not
be

proceeded
with

the
letter
and
in
all
probability
it
would
have
stood
over
for
one
day
at
least
had
it
not
been
for
the
prompt
though
at
first
sight
undutiful
behaviour
of
sam
who
seizing
his
father
by
the
skirt
of
the
coat
dragged
him
to
the
counter
and
pinned
him
there
until
he
had
affixed
his
signature
to
a
couple
of
instruments
which
from
weller
s
habit
of
printing
was
a
work
of
so
much
labour
and
time
that
the
officiating
clerk
peeled
and
ate
three
ribstone
pippins
while
it
was
performing
as
the
elder
weller
insisted
on
selling
out
his
portion
forthwith
they
proceeded
from
the
bank
to
the
gate
of
the
stock
exchange
to
which
wilkins
flasher
esquire
after
a
short
absence
returned
with
a
cheque
on

for
five
hundred
and
thirty
pounds
that
being
the
money
to
which
weller
at
the
market
price
of
the
day
was
entitled
in
consideration
of
the
balance
of
the
second
weller

funded
savings
sam
s
two
hundred
pounds
stood
transferred
to
his
name
and
wilkins
flasher
esquire
having
been
paid
his
commission
dropped
the
money
carelessly
into
his
coat
pocket
and
lounged
back
to
his
office
weller
was
at
first
obstinately
determined
on
cashing
the
cheque
in
nothing
but
sovereigns
but
it
being
represented
by
the
umpires
that
by
so
doing
he
must
incur
the
expense
of
a
small
sack
to
carry
them
home
in

consented
to
receive
the
amount
in
notes

accounts
were
produced
and
audited
pell
s
bill
was
taxed
by
sam
and
some
charges
were
disallowed
by
the
umpires
but
notwithstanding
pell
s
declaration
accompanied
with
many
solemn
asseverations
that
they
were
really
too
hard
upon
him
it
was
by
very
many
degrees
the
best
professional
job
he
had
ever
had
and
one
on
which
he
boarded
lodged
and
washed
for
six
months
afterwards
the
umpires
having
partaken
of
a
dram
shook
hands
and
departed
as
they
had
to
drive
out

that
night

pell
finding
that
nothing
more
was
going
forward
either
in
the
eating
or
drinking
way

a
friendly
leave
and
sam
and
his

were
left
alone

thrusting
his
in

for

chapter
lvi
an
important
conference
takes
place
between
pickwick
and
samuel
weller
at
which
his
parent
assists
an
old
gentleman
in
a
suit
arrives
unexpectedly
pickwick
was
sitting
alone
musing
over
many
things
and
thinking
among
other
considerations
how
he
could
best
provide
for
the
young
couple
whose
present
unsettled
condition
was
matter
of
constant
regret
and
anxiety
to
him
when
mary
stepped
lightly
into
the
room
and
advancing
to
the
table
said
rather
hastily
oh
if
you
please
sir
samuel
is
downstairs
and
he
says
may
his
father
see
you
surely
replied
pickwick
thank
you
sir
said
mary
tripping
towards
the
door
again
sam
has
not
been
here
long
has
he
inquired
pickwick
oh
no
sir
replied
mary
eagerly
he
has
only
just
come
home
he
is
not
going
to
ask
you
for
any
more
leave
sir
he
mary
might
have
been
conscious
that
she
had
communicated
this
last
intelligence
with
more
warmth
than
seemed
actually
necessary
or
she
might
have
observed
the
smile
with
which
pickwick
regarded
her
when
she
had
finished
speaking
she
certainly
held
down
her
head
and
examined
the
corner
of
a
very
smart
little
apron
with
more
closeness
than
there
appeared
any
absolute
occasion
for
tell
them
they
can
come
up
at
once
by
all
means
said
pickwick
mary
apparently
much
relieved
hurried
away
with
her
message
pickwick
took
two
or
three
turns
up
and
down
the
room
and
rubbing
his
chin
with
his
left
hand
as
he
did
so
appeared
lost
in
thought
well
well
said
pickwick
at
length
in
a
kind
but
somewhat
melancholy
tone
it
is
the
best
way
in
which
i
could
reward
him
for
his
attachment
and
fidelity
let
it
be
so
in
heaven
s
name
it
is
the
fate
of
a
lonely
old
man
that
those
about
him
should
form
new
and
different
attachments
and
leave
him
i
have
no
right
to
expect
that
it
should
be
otherwise
with
me
no
no
added
pickwick
more
cheerfully
it
would
be
selfish
and
ungrateful
i
ought
to
be
happy
to
have
an
opportunity
of
providing
for
him
so
well
i
am
of
course
i
pickwick
had
been
so
absorbed
in
these
reflections
that
a
knock
at
the
door
was
three
or
four
times
repeated
before
he
heard
it
hastily
seating
himself
and
calling
up
his
accustomed
pleasant
looks
he
gave
the
required
permission
and
sam
weller
entered
followed
by
his
father
glad
to
see
you
back
again
sam
said
pickwick
how

you

the
old
gentleman
laying
his

floor
as

sat
himself
down
remarkably
so
indeed
replied
pickwick
very
seasonablest
veather
i
ever

sir
rejoined
weller
here
the
old
gentleman
was
seized
with
a
violent
fit
of
coughing
which
being
terminated
he
nodded
his
head
and
winked
and
made
several
supplicatory
and
threatening
gestures
to
his
son
all
of
which
sam
weller
steadily
abstained
from
seeing
pickwick
perceiving
that
there
was
some
embarrassment
on
the
old
gentleman
s
part
affected
to
be
engaged
in
cutting
the
leaves
of
a
book
that
lay
beside
him
and
waited
patiently
until
weller
should
arrive
at
the
object
of
his
visit

nodded
his
head
an
extraordinary
number
of
times
in
the
excess
of
his
gratification
and
waited
in
a
listening
attitude
for
sam
to
resume
his
statement

sit
down
sam
said
pickwick
apprehending
that
the
interview
was
likely
to
prove
rather
longer
than
he
had
expected

and

placed

caught
up
his
hat
and
ran
out
of

room
with
a
celerity
scarcely
to
be
expected
from
so
corpulent
a
subject

sam
exclaimed
pickwick
earnestly

instantly
weller
here

sam
saw
that
his
master
s
injunctions
were
not
to
be
disobeyed
and
catching
his
father
by
the
arm
as
he
was
descending
the
stairs
dragged
him
back
by
main
force
my
good
friend
said
pickwick
taking
the
old
man
by

hand
your
honest
confidence

weller
obstinately
i
assure

my
good
friend
i

more

more

said
pickwick
no
man
knows
how
much
he
can
spend
till

observed
weller
perhaps
not
replied
pickwick
but
as
i
have
no
intention
of
trying
any
such
experiments
i
am
not
likely
to
come
to

i
must
beg

sam
weller

for
a
short
time
and
then
buttoning
up
his
coat
with
great
determination
said
i
ll

exclaimed
sam
a
pike
rejoined
weller
through
his
set
teeth
i

pike
say
to
your
father
samivel
i
dewote
the
remainder
of
my
days
to
a
this
threat
was
such
an
awful
one
and
weller
besides
appearing
fully
resolved
to
carry
it
into
execution
seemed
so
deeply
mortified
by
pickwick
s
refusal
that
that
gentleman
after
a
short
reflection
said
well
well
weller
i
will
keep
your
money
i
can
do
more
good
with
it
perhaps
than
you
just
the
wery
thing
to
be
sure
said
weller
brightening
up
o
course
you
can
say
no
more
about
it
said
pickwick
locking
the
in
his
desk
i
am
heartily
obliged
to
you
my
good
friend
now
sit
down
again
i
want
to
ask
your
the
internal
laughter
occasioned
by
the
triumphant
success
of
his
visit
which
had
convulsed
not
only
weller
s
face
but
his
arms
legs
and
body
also
during
the
locking
up
of
the
suddenly
gave
place
to
the
most
dignified
gravity
as
he
heard
these
words
wait
outside
a
few
minutes
sam
will
you
said
pickwick
sam
immediately
withdrew
weller
looked
uncommonly
wise
and
very
much
amazed
when
pickwick
opened
the
discourse
by
saying
you
are
not
an
advocate
for
matrimony
i
think
weller
weller
shook
his
head
he
was
wholly
unable
to
speak
vague
thoughts
of
some
wicked
widow
having
been
successful
in
her
designs
on
pickwick
choked
his
utterance
did
you
happen
to
see
a
young
girl
downstairs
when
you
came
in
just
now
with
your
son
inquired
pickwick
yes
i
see
a
young
gal
replied
weller
shortly
what
did
you
think
of
her
now
candidly
weller
what
did
you
think
of
her
i
thought
she
wos
wery
plump
and
vell
made
said
weller
with
a
critical
air
so
she
is
said
pickwick
so
she
is
what
did
you
think
of
her
manners
from
what
you
saw
of
her
wery
pleasant
rejoined
weller
wery
pleasant
and
the
precise
meaning
which
weller
attached
to
this
adjective
did
not
appear
but
as
it
was
evident
from
the
tone
in
which
he
used
it
that
it
was
a
favourable
expression
pickwick
was
as
well
satisfied
as
if
he
had
been
thoroughly
enlightened
on
the
subject
i
take
a
great
interest
in
her

said
pickwick
weller
coughed
i

pickwick
a
desire
that
she
may
be
comfortable
and
prosperous

replied
weller
who

young
person

the

pickwick
wery
careful
that

responded
weller
wery
careful
that
he
ain
t
led
avay
in
a
innocent
moment
to

anythin
as
may
lead
to

for

you

me
no
great
encouragement
to
conclude
what
i
have
to
say
observed
pickwick
but
i
had
better
do
so
at
once
this
young
person
is
not
only
attached
to
your
son
weller
but
your
son
is
attached
to
vell
said
weller
this
here
s
a
pretty
sort
o
thing
to
come
to
a
father
s
ears
this
is
i
have
observed
them
on
several
occasions
said
pickwick
making
no
comment
on
weller
s
last
remark
and
entertain
no
doubt
at
all
about
it
supposing
i
were
desirous
of
establishing
them
comfortably
as
man
and
wife
in
some
little
business
or
situation
where
they
might
hope
to
obtain
a
decent
living
what
should
you
think
of
it
weller
at
first
weller
received
with
wry
faces
a
proposition
involving
the
marriage
of
anybody
in
whom
he
took
an
interest
but
as
pickwick
argued
the
point
with
him
and
laid
great
stress
on
the
fact
that
mary
was
not
a
widow
he
gradually
became
more
tractable
pickwick
had
great
influence
over
him
and
he
had
been
much
struck
with
mary
s
appearance
having
in
fact
bestowed
several
very
unfatherly
winks
upon
her
already
at
length
he
said
that
it
was
not
for
him
to
oppose
pickwick
s
inclination
and
that
he
would
be
very
happy
to
yield
to
his
advice
upon
which
pickwick
joyfully
took
him
at
his
word
and
called
sam
back
into
the
room
sam
said
pickwick
clearing
his
throat
your
father
and
i
have
been
having
some
conversation
about
about
you
samivel
said
weller
in
a
patronising
and
impressive
voice
i
am
not
so
blind
sam
as
not
to
have
seen
a
long
time
since
that
you
entertain
something
more
than
a
friendly
feeling
towards
winkle
s
maid
said
pickwick
you
hear
this
samivel
said
weller
in
the
same
judicial
form
of
speech
as
before
i
hope
sir
said
sam
addressing
his
master
i
hope
there
s
no
harm
in
a
young
man
takin
notice
of
a
young
ooman
as
is
undeniably
looking
and
certainly
not
said
pickwick
not
by
no
means
acquiesced
weller
affably
but
magisterially
so
far
from
thinking
there
is
anything
wrong
in
conduct
so
natural
resumed
pickwick
it
is
my
wish
to
assist
and
promote
your
wishes
in
this
respect
with
this
view
i
have
had
a
little
conversation
with
your
father
and
finding
that
he
is
of
my
opinion
the
lady
not
bein
a
widder
interposed
weller
in
explanation
the
lady
not
being
a
widow
said
pickwick
smiling
i
wish
to
free
you
from
the
restraint
which
your
present
position
imposes
upon
you
and
to
mark
my
sense
of
your
fidelity
and
many
excellent
qualities
by
enabling
you
to
marry
this
girl
at
once
and
to
earn
an
independent
livelihood
for
yourself
and
family
i
shall
be
proud
sam
said
pickwick
whose
voice
had
faltered
a
little
hitherto
but
now
resumed
its
customary
tone
proud
and
happy
to
make
your
future
prospects
in
life
my
grateful
and
peculiar
there
was
a
profound
silence
for
a
short
time
and
then
sam
said
in
a
low
husky
sort
of
voice
but
firmly
withal
i
m
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
your
goodness
sir
as
is
only
like
yourself
but
it
can
t
be

t
be

ejaculated
pickwick
in
astonishment
samivel
said
weller
with
dignity
i
say

can
t
be
done
repeated
sam
in
a
louder
key
wot

become
of

my
good

replied
pickwick
the
recent
changes

growing
older

encouragingly

long
deliberation
sam
and
with
the
certainty
that

said
pickwick
shaking
his
head
new
scenes

closed
upon
me

sam

wery
fiercest
nothin

ever
perwent
it
at
the
close
of
this
declaration
which
sam
made
with
great
emotion
the
elder
weller
rose
from
his
chair
and
forgetting
all
considerations
of
time
place
or
propriety
waved
his
hat
above
his
head
and
gave
three
vehement
cheers
my
good
fellow
said
pickwick
when
weller
had
sat
down
again
rather
abashed
at
his
own
enthusiasm
you
are
bound
to
consider
the
young
woman
i
do
consider
the
young
ooman
sir
said
sam
i
have
considered
the
young
ooman
i
ve
spoke
to
her
i
ve
told
her
how
i
m
sitivated
she

ready
to
vait

i
believe
she

young
ooman
i
take
her
for
and
i
give
her
up
vith
readiness
you
ve
know
d
me
afore
sir
my
mind
s
made
up
and
nothin
can
ever
alter
who
could
combat
this
resolution
not
pickwick
he
derived
at
that
moment
more
pride
and
luxury
of
feeling
from
the
disinterested
attachment
of
his
humble
friends
than
ten
thousand
protestations
from
the
greatest
men
living
could
have
awakened
in
his
heart
while
this
conversation
was
passing
in
pickwick
s
room
a
little
old
gentleman
in
a
suit
of
clothes
followed
by
a
porter
carrying
a
small
portmanteau
presented
himself
below
and
after
securing
a
bed
for
the
night
inquired
of
the
waiter
whether
one
winkle
was
staying
there
to
which
question
the
waiter
of
course
responded
in
the
affirmative
is
she
alone
inquired
the
old
gentleman
i
believe
she
is
sir
replied
the
waiter
i
can
call
her
own
maid
sir
if
you
no
i
don
t
want
her
said
the
old
gentleman
quickly
show
me
to
her
room
without
announcing
eh
sir
said
the
waiter
are
you
deaf
inquired
the
little
old
gentleman
no
then
listen
if
you
please
can
you
hear
me
now
yes
that
s
well
show
me
to
winkle
s
room
without
announcing
as
the
little
old
gentleman
uttered
this
command
he
slipped
five
shillings
into
the
waiter
s
hand
and
looked
steadily
at
him
really
sir
said
the
waiter
i
don
t
know
sir
whether
ah
you
ll
do
it
i
see
said
the
little
old
gentleman
you
had
better
do
it
at
once
it
will
save
there
was
something
so
very
cool
and
collected
in
the
gentleman
s
manner
that
the
waiter
put
the
five
shillings
in
his
pocket
and
led
him
upstairs
without
another
word
this
is
the
room
is
it
said
the
gentleman
you
may
the
waiter
complied
wondering
much
who
the
gentleman
could
be
and
what
he
wanted
the
little
old
gentleman
waiting
till
he
was
out
of
sight
tapped
at
the
door
come
in
said
arabella
um
a
pretty
voice
at
any
rate
murmured
the
little
old
gentleman
but
that
s
as
he
said
this
he
opened
the
door
and
walked
in
arabella
who
was
sitting
at
work
rose
on
beholding
a
stranger
a
little
confused
but
by
no
means
ungracefully
so
pray
don
t
rise
ma
am
said
the
unknown
walking
in
and
closing
the
door
after
him
mrs
winkle
i
believe
arabella
inclined
her
head
mrs
nathaniel
winkle
who
married
the
son
of
the
old
man
at
birmingham
said
the
stranger
eyeing
arabella
with
visible
curiosity
again
arabella
inclined
her
head
and
looked
uneasily
round
as
if
uncertain
whether
to
call
for
assistance
i
surprise
you
i
see
ma
am
said
the
old
gentleman
rather
i
confess
replied
arabella
wondering
more
and
more
i
ll
take
a
chair
if
you
ll
allow
me
ma
am
said
the
stranger
he
took
one
and
drawing
a
from
his
pocket
leisurely
pulled
out
a
pair
of
spectacles
which
he
adjusted
on
his
nose
you
don
t
know
me
ma
am
he
said
looking
so
intently
at
arabella
that
she
began
to
feel
alarmed
no
sir
she
replied
timidly
no
said
the
gentleman
nursing
his
left
leg
i
don
t
know
how
you
should
you
know
my
name
though
ma
do
i
said
arabella
trembling
though
she
scarcely
knew
why
may
i
ask
what
it
is
presently
ma
am
presently
said
the
stranger
not
having
yet
removed
his
eyes
from
her
countenance
you
have
been
recently
married
ma
am
i
have
replied
arabella
in
a
scarcely
audible
tone
laying
aside
her
work
and
becoming
greatly
agitated
as
a
thought
that
had
occurred
to
her
before
struck
more
forcibly
upon
her
mind
without
having
represented
to
your
husband
the
propriety
of
first
consulting
his
father
on
whom
he
is
dependent
i
think
said
the
stranger
arabella
applied
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
without
an
endeavour
even
to
ascertain
by
some
indirect
appeal
what
were
the
old
man
s
sentiments
on
a
point
in
which
he
would
naturally
feel
much
interested
said
the
stranger
i
can
not
deny
it
sir
said
arabella
and
without
having
sufficient
property
of
your
own
to
afford
your
husband
any
permanent
assistance
in
exchange
for
the
worldly
advantages
which
you
knew
he
would
have
gained
if
he
had
married
agreeably
to
his
father
s
wishes
said
the
old
gentleman
this
is
what
boys
and
girls
call
disinterested
affection
till
they
have
boys
and
girls
of
their
own
and
then
they
see
it
in
a
rougher
and
very
different
light
arabella
s
tears
flowed
fast
as
she
pleaded
in
extenuation
that
she
was
young
and
inexperienced
that
her
attachment
had
alone
induced
her
to
take
the
step
to
which
she
had
resorted
and
that
she
had
been
deprived
of
the
counsel
and
guidance
of
her
parents
almost
from
infancy
it
was
wrong
said
the
old
gentleman
in
a
milder
tone
very
wrong
it
was
romantic
unbusinesslike
it
was
my
fault
all
my
fault
sir
replied
poor
arabella
weeping
nonsense
said
the
old
gentleman
it
was
not
your
fault
that
he
fell
in
love
with
you
i
suppose
yes
it
was
though
said
the
old
gentleman
looking
rather
slily
at
arabella
it
was
your
fault
he
couldn
t
help
this
little
compliment
or
the
little
gentleman
s
odd
way
of
paying
it
or
his
altered
manner
so
much
kinder
than
it
was
at
first
or
all
three
together
forced
a
smile
from
arabella
in
the
midst
of
her
tears
where
s
your
husband
inquired
the
old
gentleman
abruptly
stopping
a
smile
which
was
just
coming
over
his
own
face
i
expect
him
every
instant
sir
said
arabella
i
persuaded
him
to
take
a
walk
this
morning
he
is
very
low
and
wretched
at
not
having
heard
from
his
low
is
he
said
the
old
gentlemen
serve
him
right
he
feels
it
on
my
account
i
am
afraid
said
arabella
and
indeed
sir
i
feel
it
deeply
on
his
i
have
been
the
sole
means
of
bringing
him
to
his
present
don
t
mind
it
on
his
account
my
dear
said
the
old
gentleman
it
serves
him
right
i
am
glad
of
it
actually
glad
of
it
as
far
as
he
is
the
words
were
scarcely
out
of
the
old
gentleman
s
lips
when
footsteps
were
heard
ascending
the
stairs
which
he
and
arabella
seemed
both
to
recognise
at
the
same
moment
the
little
gentleman
turned
pale
and
making
a
strong
effort
to
appear
composed
stood
up
as
winkle
entered
the
room
father
cried
winkle
recoiling
in
amazement
yes
sir
replied
the
little
old
gentleman
well
sir
what
have
you
got
to
say
to
me
winkle
remained
silent
you
are
ashamed
of
yourself
i
hope
sir
said
the
old
gentleman
still
winkle
said
nothing
are
you
ashamed
of
yourself
sir
or
are
you
not
inquired
the
old
gentleman
no
sir
replied
winkle
drawing
arabella
s
arm
through
his
i
am
not
ashamed
of
myself
or
of
my
wife
upon
my
word
cried
the
old
gentleman
ironically
i
am
very
sorry
to
have
done
anything
which
has
lessened
your
affection
for
me
sir
said
winkle
but
i
will
say
at
the
same
time
that
i
have
no
reason
to
be
ashamed
of
having
this
lady
for
my
wife
nor
you
of
having
her
for
a
give
me
your
hand
nat
said
the
old
gentleman
in
an
altered
voice
kiss
me
my
love
you
are
a
very
charming
little
after
all
in
a
few
minutes
time
winkle
went
in
search
of
pickwick
and
returning
with
that
gentleman
presented
him
to
his
father
whereupon
they
shook
hands
for
five
minutes
incessantly
mr
pickwick
i
thank
you
most
heartily
for
all
your
kindness
to
my
son
said
old
winkle
in
a
bluff
straightforward
way
i
am
a
hasty
fellow
and
when
i
saw
you
last
i
was
vexed
and
taken
by
surprise
i
have
judged
for
myself
now
and
am
more
than
satisfied
shall
i
make
any
more
apologies
pickwick
not
one
replied
that
gentleman
you
have
done
the
only
thing
wanting
to
complete
my
hereupon
there
was
another
shaking
of
hands
for
five
minutes
longer
accompanied
by
a
great
number
of
complimentary
speeches
which
besides
being
complimentary
had
the
additional
and
very
novel
recommendation
of
being
sincere
sam
had
dutifully
seen
his
father
to
the
belle
sauvage
when
on
returning
he
encountered
the
fat
boy
in
the
court
who
had
been
charged
with
the
delivery
of
a
note
from
emily
wardle
i
say
said
joe
who
was
unusually
loquacious
what
a
pretty
girl
mary
is
isn
t
she
i
am
fond
of
her
i
am
weller
made
no
verbal
remark
in
reply
but
eyeing
the
fat
boy
for
a
moment
quite
transfixed
at
his
presumption
led
him
by
the
collar
to
the
corner
and
dismissed
him
with
a
harmless
but
ceremonious
kick
after
which
he
walked
home
whistling
chapter
lvii
in
which
the
pickwick
club
is
finally
dissolved
and
everything
concluded
to
the
satisfaction
of
everybody
for
a
whole
week
after
the
happy
arrival
of
winkle
from
birmingham
pickwick
and
sam
weller
were
from
home
all
day
long
only
returning
just
in
time
for
dinner
and
then
wearing
an
air
of
mystery
and
importance
quite
foreign
to
their
natures
it
was
evident
that
very
grave
and
eventful
proceedings
were
on
foot
but
various
surmises
were
afloat
respecting
their
precise
character
some
among
whom
was
tupman
were
disposed
to
think
that
pickwick
contemplated
a
matrimonial
alliance
but
this
idea
the
ladies
most
strenuously
repudiated
others
rather
inclined
to
the
belief
that
he
had
projected
some
distant
tour
and
was
at
present
occupied
in
effecting
the
preliminary
arrangements
but
this
again
was
stoutly
denied
by
sam
himself
who
had
unequivocally
stated
when
by
mary
that
no
new
journeys
were
to
be
undertaken
at
length
when
the
brains
of
the
whole
party
had
been
racked
for
six
long
days
by
unavailing
speculation
it
was
unanimously
resolved
that
pickwick
should
be
called
upon
to
explain
his
conduct
and
to
state
distinctly
why
he
had
thus
absented
himself
from
the
society
of
his
admiring
friends
with
this
view
wardle
invited
the
full
circle
to
dinner
at
the
adelphi
and
the
decanters
having
been
thrice
sent
round
opened
the
business
we
are
all
anxious
to
know
said
the
old
gentleman
what
we
have
done
to
offend
you
and
to
induce
you
to
desert
us
and
devote
yourself
to
these
solitary
are
you
said
pickwick
it
is
singular
enough
that
i
had
intended
to
volunteer
a
full
explanation
this
very
day
so
if
you
will
give
me
another
glass
of
wine
i
will
satisfy
your
the
decanters
passed
from
hand
to
hand
with
unwonted
briskness
and
pickwick
looking
round
on
the
faces
of
his
friends
with
a
cheerful
smile
proceeded
all
the
changes
that
have
taken
place
among
us
said
pickwick
i
mean
the
marriage
that
place
and
the
marriage
that
will
take
place
with
the
changes
they
involve
rendered
it
necessary
for
me
to
think
soberly
and
at
once
upon
my
future
plans
i
determined
on
retiring
to
some
quiet
pretty
neighbourhood
in
the
vicinity
of
london
i
saw
a
house
which
exactly
suited
my
fancy
i
have
taken
it
and
furnished
it
it
is
fully
prepared
for
my
reception
and
i
intend
entering
upon
it
at
once
trusting
that
i
may
yet
live
to
spend
many
quiet
years
in
peaceful
retirement
cheered
through
life
by
the
society
of
my
friends
and
followed
in
death
by
their
affectionate
here
pickwick
paused
and
a
low
murmur
ran
round
the
table
the
house
i
have
taken
said
pickwick
is
at
dulwich
it
has
a
large
garden
and
is
situated
in
one
of
the
most
pleasant
spots
near
london
it
has
been
fitted
up
with
every
attention
to
substantial
comfort
perhaps
to
a
little
elegance
besides
but
of
that
you
shall
judge
for
yourselves
sam
accompanies
me
there
i
have
engaged
on
perker
s
representation
a
housekeeper
a
very
old
one
and
such
other
servants
as
she
thinks
i
shall
require
i
propose
to
consecrate
this
little
retreat
by
having
a
ceremony
in
which
i
take
a
great
interest
performed
there
i
wish
if
my
friend
wardle
entertains
no
objection
that
his
daughter
should
be
married
from
my
new
house
on
the
day
i
take
possession
of
it
the
happiness
of
young
people
said
pickwick
a
little
moved
has
ever
been
the
chief
pleasure
of
my
life
it
will
warm
my
heart
to
witness
the
happiness
of
those
friends
who
are
dearest
to
me
beneath
my
own
pickwick
paused
again
emily
and
arabella
sobbed
audibly
i
have
communicated
both
personally
and
by
letter
with
the
club
resumed
pickwick
acquainting
them
with
my
intention
during
our
long
absence
it
has
suffered
much
from
internal
dissentions
and
the
withdrawal
of
my
name
coupled
with
this
and
other
circumstances
has
occasioned
its
dissolution
the
pickwick
club
exists
no
longer
i
shall
never
regret
said
pickwick
in
a
low
voice
i
shall
never
regret
having
devoted
the
greater
part
of
two
years
to
mixing
with
different
varieties
and
shades
of
human
character
frivolous
as
my
pursuit
of
novelty
may
have
appeared
to
many
nearly
the
whole
of
my
previous
life
having
been
devoted
to
business
and
the
pursuit
of
wealth
numerous
scenes
of
which
i
had
no
previous
conception
have
dawned
upon
me
i
hope
to
the
enlargement
of
my
mind
and
the
improvement
of
my
understanding
if
i
have
done
but
little
good
i
trust
i
have
done
less
harm
and
that
none
of
my
adventures
will
be
other
than
a
source
of
amusing
and
pleasant
recollection
to
me
in
the
decline
of
life
god
bless
you
all
with
these
words
pickwick
filled
and
drained
a
bumper
with
a
trembling
hand
and
his
eyes
moistened
as
his
friends
rose
with
one
accord
and
pledged
him
from
their
hearts
there
were
few
preparatory
arrangements
to
be
made
for
the
marriage
of
snodgrass
as
he
had
neither
father
nor
mother
and
had
been
in
his
minority
a
ward
of
pickwick
s
that
gentleman
was
perfectly
well
acquainted
with
his
possessions
and
prospects
his
account
of
both
was
quite
satisfactory
to
wardle
as
almost
any
other
account
would
have
been
for
the
good
old
gentleman
was
overflowing
with
hilarity
and
kindness
and
a
handsome
portion
having
been
bestowed
upon
emily
the
marriage
was
fixed
to
take
place
on
the
fourth
day
from
that
time
the
suddenness
of
which
preparations
reduced
three
dressmakers
and
a
tailor
to
the
extreme
verge
of
insanity
getting
to
the
carriage
old
wardle
started
off
next
day
to
bring
his
mother
back
to
town
communicating
his
intelligence
to
the
old
lady
with
characteristic
impetuosity
she
instantly
fainted
away
but
being
promptly
revived
ordered
the
brocaded
silk
gown
to
be
packed
up
forthwith
and
proceeded
to
relate
some
circumstances
of
a
similar
nature
attending
the
marriage
of
the
eldest
daughter
of
lady
tollimglower
deceased
which
occupied
three
hours
in
the
recital
and
were
not
half
finished
at
last
trundle
had
to
be
informed
of
all
the
mighty
preparations
that
were
making
in
london
and
being
in
a
delicate
state
of
health
was
informed
thereof
through
trundle
lest
the
news
should
be
too
much
for
her
but
it
was
not
too
much
for
her
inasmuch
as
she
at
once
wrote
off
to
muggleton
to
order
a
new
cap
and
a
black
satin
gown
and
moreover
avowed
her
determination
of
being
present
at
the
ceremony
hereupon
trundle
called
in
the
doctor
and
the
doctor
said
trundle
ought
to
know
best
how
she
felt
herself
to
which
trundle
replied
that
she
felt
herself
quite
equal
to
it
and
that
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
go
upon
which
the
doctor
who
was
a
wise
and
discreet
doctor
and
knew
what
was
good
for
himself
as
well
as
for
other
people
said
that
perhaps
if
trundle
stopped
at
home
she
might
hurt
herself
more
by
fretting
than
by
going
so
perhaps
she
had
better
go
and
she
did
go
the
doctor
with
great
attention
sending
in
half
a
dozen
of
medicine
to
be
drunk
upon
the
road
in
addition
to
these
points
of
distraction
wardle
was
intrusted
with
two
small
letters
to
two
small
young
ladies
who
were
to
act
as
bridesmaids
upon
the
receipt
of
which
the
two
young
ladies
were
driven
to
despair
by
having
no
things
ready
for
so
important
an
occasion
and
no
time
to
make
them
in
a
circumstance
which
appeared
to
afford
the
two
worthy
papas
of
the
two
small
young
ladies
rather
a
feeling
of
satisfaction
than
otherwise
however
old
frocks
were
trimmed
and
new
bonnets
made
and
the
young
ladies
looked
as
well
as
could
possibly
have
been
expected
of
them
and
as
they
cried
at
the
subsequent
ceremony
in
the
proper
places
and
trembled
at
the
right
times
they
acquitted
themselves
to
the
admiration
of
all
beholders
how
the
two
poor
relations
ever
reached
london
whether
they
walked
or
got
behind
coaches
or
procured
lifts
in
wagons
or
carried
each
other
by
turns
is
uncertain
but
there
they
were
before
wardle
and
the
very
first
people
that
knocked
at
the
door
of
pickwick
s
house
on
the
bridal
morning
were
the
two
poor
relations
all
smiles
and
shirt
collar
they
were
welcomed
heartily
though
for
riches
or
poverty
had
no
influence
on
pickwick
the
new
servants
were
all
alacrity
and
readiness
sam
was
in
a
most
unrivalled
state
of
high
spirits
and
excitement
mary
was
glowing
with
beauty
and
smart
ribands
the
bridegroom
who
had
been
staying
at
the
house
for
two
or
three
days
previous
sallied
forth
gallantly
to
dulwich
church
to
meet
the
bride
attended
by
pickwick
ben
allen
bob
sawyer
and
tupman
with
sam
weller
outside
having
at
his
a
white
favour
the
gift
of
his
and
clad
in
a
new
and
gorgeous
suit
of
livery
invented
for
the
occasion
they
were
met
by
the
wardles
and
the
winkles
and
the
bride
and
bridesmaids
and
the
trundles
and
the
ceremony
having
been
performed
the
coaches
rattled
back
to
pickwick
s
to
breakfast
where
little
perker
already
awaited
them
here
all
the
light
clouds
of
the
more
solemn
part
of
the
proceedings
passed
away
every
face
shone
forth
joyously
and
nothing
was
to
be
heard
but
congratulations
and
commendations
everything
was
so
beautiful
the
lawn
in
front
the
garden
behind
the
miniature
conservatory
the
the
the
bedrooms
the
and
above
all
the
study
with
its
pictures
and
chairs
and
odd
cabinets
and
queer
tables
and
books
out
of
number
with
a
large
cheerful
window
opening
upon
a
pleasant
lawn
and
commanding
a
pretty
landscape
dotted
here
and
there
with
little
houses
almost
hidden
by
the
trees
and
then
the
curtains
and
the
carpets
and
the
chairs
and
the
sofas
everything
was
so
beautiful
so
compact
so
neat
and
in
such
exquisite
taste
said
everybody
that
there
really
was
no
deciding
what
to
admire
most
and
in
the
midst
of
all
this
stood
pickwick
his
countenance
lighted
up
with
smiles
which
the
heart
of
no
man
woman
or
child
could
resist
himself
the
happiest
of
the
group
shaking
hands
over
and
over
again
with
the
same
people
and
when
his
own
hands
were
not
so
employed
rubbing
them
with
pleasure
turning
round
in
a
different
direction
at
every
fresh
expression
of
gratification
or
curiosity
and
inspiring
everybody
with
his
looks
of
gladness
and
delight
breakfast
is
announced
pickwick
leads
the
old
lady
who
has
been
very
eloquent
on
the
subject
of
lady
tollimglower
to
the
top
of
a
long
table
wardle
takes
the
bottom
the
friends
arrange
themselves
on
either
side
sam
takes
his
station
behind
his
master
s
chair
the
laughter
and
talking
cease
pickwick
having
said
grace
pauses
for
an
instant
and
looks
round
him
as
he
does
so
the
tears
roll
down
his
cheeks
in
the
fullness
of
his
joy
let
us
leave
our
old
friend
in
one
of
those
moments
of
unmixed
happiness
of
which
if
we
seek
them
there
are
ever
some
to
cheer
our
transitory
existence
here
there
are
dark
shadows
on
the
earth
but
its
lights
are
stronger
in
the
contrast
some
men
like
bats
or
owls
have
better
eyes
for
the
darkness
than
for
the
light
we
who
have
no
such
optical
powers
are
better
pleased
to
take
our
last
parting
look
at
the
visionary
companions
of
many
solitary
hours
when
the
brief
sunshine
of
the
world
is
blazing
full
upon
them
it
is
the
fate
of
most
men
who
mingle
with
the
world
and
attain
even
the
prime
of
life
to
make
many
real
friends
and
lose
them
in
the
course
of
nature
it
is
the
fate
of
all
authors
or
chroniclers
to
create
imaginary
friends
and
lose
them
in
the
course
of
art
nor
is
this
the
full
extent
of
their
misfortunes
for
they
are
required
to
furnish
an
account
of
them
besides
in
compliance
with
this
custom
unquestionably
a
bad
one
we
subjoin
a
few
biographical
words
in
relation
to
the
party
at
pickwick
s
assembled
and
winkle
being
fully
received
into
favour
by
the
old
gentleman
were
shortly
afterwards
installed
in
a
house
not
half
a
mile
from
pickwick
s
winkle
being
engaged
in
the
city
as
agent
or
town
correspondent
of
his
father
exchanged
his
old
costume
for
the
ordinary
dress
of
englishmen
and
presented
all
the
external
appearance
of
a
civilised
christian
ever
afterwards
and
snodgrass
settled
at
dingley
dell
where
they
purchased
and
cultivated
a
small
farm
more
for
occupation
than
profit
snodgrass
being
occasionally
abstracted
and
melancholy
is
to
this
day
reputed
a
great
poet
among
his
friends
and
acquaintance
although
we
do
not
find
that
he
has
ever
written
anything
to
encourage
the
belief
there
are
many
celebrated
characters
literary
philosophical
and
otherwise
who
hold
a
high
reputation
on
a
similar
tenure
tupman
when
his
friends
married
and
pickwick
settled
took
lodgings
at
richmond
where
he
has
ever
since
resided
he
walks
constantly
on
the
terrace
during
the
summer
months
with
a
youthful
and
jaunty
air
which
has
rendered
him
the
admiration
of
the
numerous
elderly
ladies
of
single
condition
who
reside
in
the
vicinity
he
has
never
proposed
again

having
previously
passed
through
the

by
benjamin
allen

gentlemen
having
received
surgical
appointments
from
the
east

company
they
each
had
the
yellow
fever
fourteen
times
and
then
resolved
to
try
a
little
abstinence
since
which
period
they
have
been
doing
well
bardell
let
lodgings
to
many
conversable
single
gentlemen
with
great
profit
but
never
brought
any
more
actions
for
breach
of

of
marriage
her
attorneys

fogg

in
business
from
which
they
realise
a
large
income
and
in
which
they
are
universally
considered
among
the
sharpest
of
the
sharp
sam
weller
kept
his
word
and
remained
unmarried
for
two
years
the
old
housekeeper
dying
at
the
end
of
that
time
pickwick
promoted
mary
to
the
situation
on
condition
of
her
marrying
weller
at
once
which
she
did
without
a
murmur
from
the
circumstance
of
two
sturdy
little
boys
having
been
repeatedly
seen
at
the
gate
of
the
back
garden
there
is
reason
to
suppose
that
sam
has
some
family
the
elder
weller
drove
a
coach
for
twelve
months
but
being
afflicted
with
the
gout
was
compelled
to
retire
the
contents
of
the
had
been
so
well
invested
for
him
however
by
pickwick
that
he
had
a
handsome
independence
to
retire
on
upon
which
he
still
lives
at
an
excellent
near
shooter
s
hill
where
he
is
quite
reverenced
as
an
oracle
boasting
very
much
of
his
intimacy
with
pickwick
and
retaining
a
most
unconquerable
aversion
to
widows
pickwick
himself
continued
to
reside
in
his
new
house
employing
his
leisure
hours
in
arranging
the
memoranda
which
he
afterwards
presented
to
the
secretary
of
the
once
famous
club
or
in
hearing
sam
weller
read
aloud
with
such
remarks
as
suggested
themselves
to
his
mind
which
never
failed
to
afford
pickwick
great
amusement
he
was
much
troubled
at
first
by
the
numerous
applications
made
to
him
by
snodgrass
winkle
and
trundle
to
act
as
godfather
to
their
offspring
but
he
has
become
used
to
it
now
and
officiates
as
a
matter
of
course
he
never
had
occasion
to
regret
his
bounty
to
jingle
for
both
that
person
and
job
trotter
became
in
time
worthy
members
of
society
although
they
have
always
steadily
objected
to
return
to
the
scenes
of
their
old
haunts
and
temptations
pickwick
is
somewhat
infirm
now
but
he
retains
all
his
former
juvenility
of
spirit
and
may
still
be
frequently
seen
contemplating
the
pictures
in
the
dulwich
gallery
or
enjoying
a
walk
about
the
pleasant
neighbourhood
on
a
fine
day
he
is
known
by
all
the
poor
people
about
who
never
fail
to
take
their
hats
off
as
he
passes
with
great
respect
the
children
idolise
him
and
so
indeed
does
the
whole
neighbourhood
every
year
he
repairs
to
a
large
family
at
wardle
s
on
this
as
on
all
other
occasions
he
is
invariably
attended
by
the
faithful
sam
between
whom
and
his
master
there
exists
a
steady
and
reciprocal
attachment
which
nothing
but
death
will
terminate
