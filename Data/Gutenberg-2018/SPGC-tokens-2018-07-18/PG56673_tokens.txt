september
a
foreword
of
warning
a
few
years
ago
when
i
began
looking
over
the
map
of
the
world
again
i
chanced
to
have
just
been
reading
prescott
s
conquest
of
peru
and
it
was
natural
that
my
thoughts
should
turn
to
south
america
my
only
plan
at
the
outset
was
to
follow
if
possible
the
old
military
highway
of
the
incas
from
quito
to
cuzco
every
traveler
however
knows
the
tendency
of
a
journey
to
grow
under
one
s
feet
this
one
grew
with
such
tropical
luxuriance
that
before
it
ended
i
had
spent
not
eight
months
but
four
full
years
and
had
covered
not
merely
the
ancient
inca
empire
but
all
the
ten
republics
and
three
colonies
of
south
america
a
considerable
portion
of
this
journey
was
made
on
foot
the
reader
may
be
moved
to
ask
why
first
of
all
i
formed
the
habit
of
walking
early
in
life
developing
an
inability
to
depend
on
others
in
my
movements
then
too
the
route
lay
through
many
regions
in
which
no
other
animal
than
man
can
make
his
way
for
extended
periods
moreover
there
was
the
question
of
caste
it
is
one
of
the
drawbacks
of
south
america
that
a
white
man
can
not
efface
himself
and
be
an
unobserved
observer
as
on
the
highways
of
europe
social
lines
are
so
sharply
drawn
that
he
who
would
be
received
in
frank
equality
by
the
peon
by
the
great
mass
of
the
population
must
live
and
travel
much
as
they
do
merely
to
ride
a
horse
lifts
him
above
the
communality
and
sets
a
certain
barrier
akin
to
race
prejudice
between
him
and
the
hordes
among
whom
my
chief
interest
lay
at
best
these
lines
of
caste
are
a
drag
on
observant
travel
in
south
america
the
gringo
can
never
get
completely
out
of
his
social
stratum
his
very
color
betrays
him
it
is
always
goot
mawning
meestear
too
often
with
a
silly
patronizing
smile
from
the
gente
decente
class
among
the
rest
his
mere
appearance
makes
him
as
conspicuous
as
a
white
man
among
west
indians
never
can
he
be
an
inconspicuous
part
of
the
crowd
as
in
europe
to
get
in
touch
with
the
common
people
requires
actually
living
in
their
huts
and
tramping
their
roads
the
dilettante
method
of
approaching
them
slumming
will
not
do
the
disadvantages
of
the
primitive
means
of
locomotion
in
wild
regions
such
as
the
andes
are
obvious
but
the
advantages
of
walking
over
more
ordinary
methods
of
travel
are
no
less
decided
though
the
means
be
more
laborious
the
mind
is
far
sharper
for
facts
and
impressions
while
on
foot
than
when
lolling
half
asleep
on
a
horse
or
in
a
train
the
mere
pleasure
of
looking
forward
to
his
arrival
subconsciously
building
up
before
his
mind
s
eye
a
picture
of
his
goal
complete
in
every
detail
not
to
mention
that
of
looking
back
upon
the
journey
from
the
comfort
of
his
own
armchair
is
ample
reward
to
any
true
victim
of
wanderlust
thousands
of
men
supplied
with
all
the
comforts
money
can
buy
roam
the
earth
from
top
to
are
supremely
bored
in
the
process
it
is
the
struggle
the
satisfaction
of
physical
action
the
accomplishment
of
something
greatly
desired
and
for
a
long
time
seemingly
impossible
that
brings
real
pleasure
that
makes
every
step
forward
a
satisfaction
every
little
success
in
the
advance
an
enjoyment
for
after
all
real
travel
is
real
labor
he
who
journeys
only
so
far
as
he
can
without
exertion
who
shirks
the
difficulties
will
know
no
more
of
the
real
joy
of
travel
than
he
who
lives
without
toil
seeking
pleasure
only
and
finding
but
the
cold
dead
body
thereof
without
ever
realizing
the
joy
of
life
itself
as
in
ancient
times
so
it
is
in
the
andes
distance
can
not
be
covered
without
fatigue
on
the
other
hand
there
is
the
compensation
of
knowing
completely
the
country
through
which
one
passes
storing
away
in
the
mind
a
picture
of
each
spot
indelible
as
long
as
life
lasts
the
andean
traveler
will
know
the
pleasures
as
well
as
the
drawbacks
of
the
journeys
of
earlier
more
primitive
days
the
joy
of
evening
hours
when
suddenly
from
the
summit
of
the
last
toilsome
ascent
he
discovers
spread
out
in
its
smiling
valley
below
the
peaceful
village
in
which
he
is
to
take
his
night
s
repose
or
when
he
perceives
from
afar
gilded
by
the
rays
of
the
setting
sun
the
towers
of
the
famous
city
so
long
sought
of
a
vivid
joy
that
few
experiences
can
equal
thanks
again
to
the
barriers
of
caste
he
who
would
really
know
the
masses
of
latin
america
should
not
only
live
with
them
but
should
dress
as
plainly
as
they
do
it
is
hard
at
best
to
get
into
more
than
superficial
contact
with
the
south
american
indian
and
to
some
extent
his
traits
like
his
blood
run
through
all
classes
the
latin
american
is
by
nature
a
masquerader
he
treats
a
distinguished
stranger
as
a
real
estate
agent
pilots
a
prospective
buyer
about
the
streets
of
some
new
berlin
cleverly
sidestepping
the
drawbacks
he
shows
his
real
self
only
when
he
is
not
on
parade
before
he
learns
that
he
is
under
observation
and
claps
on
the
mask
he
always
has
instantly
at
hand
when
he
wishes
to
show
himself
and
he
rates
every
man
s
importance
by
the
height
of
his
collar
and
the
color
of
his
spats
cloaking
himself
in
pretense
accordingly
he
who
does
not
wish
to
know
the
truth
about
a
country
should
attire
himself
in
a
a
silk
hat
and
appear
with
letters
of
introduction
to
the
people
of
his
hosts
will
take
him
in
regal
style
along
two
or
three
of
the
best
streets
and
into
the
will
gild
every
that
is
likely
to
fall
under
his
august
eye
and
will
shield
him
from
all
the
unpleasantnesses
of
life
as
carefully
as
the
guardians
of
the
princess
in
the
hence
the
mere
lack
of
ostentation
the
mere
appearance
of
being
one
of
the
negligible
masses
goes
far
toward
giving
the
unassigned
wanderer
a
vast
advantage
in
getting
at
the
unmasked
truth
in
avoiding
false
impressions
over
men
of
more
brilliant
mind
and
better
powers
of
observation
my
purpose
in
journeying
through
south
america
was
primarily
to
study
the
ways
of
the
common
people
i
am
no
more
fond
of
the
unsavory
either
in
physical
contact
or
on
the
printed
page
than
are
the
rest
of
my
but
every
occupation
has
its
drawbacks
no
traveler
through
interior
south
america
with
whom
i
have
yet
spoken
has
found
conditions
better
than
herein
indicated
though
for
some
strange
reason
it
appears
to
be
the
custom
to
shield
readers
from
this
to
tell
intimate
facts
only
privately
and
to
falsify
public
utterances
by
glossing
over
all
the
crudities
the
fact
is
that
the
man
who
has
spent
four
years
afield
south
of
the
rio
grande
and
has
come
back
to
tell
the
tale
can
only
shake
with
laughter
when
an
exponent
of
the
germ
theory
speaks
explorers
with
millionaire
tell
us
that
the
traveler
to
such
a
country
should
take
with
him
numberless
supplies
from
sheets
to
coffee
it
is
the
best
plan
for
those
whose
aim
is
to
live
in
a
still
better
plan
is
to
remain
at
home
far
be
it
from
me
to
censure
the
man
who
journeys
southward
for
other
purposes
for
taking
with
him
all
the
comforts
he
can
carry
but
he
who
seeks
to
know
the
people
intimately
must
not
merely
tramp
their
trails
he
must
become
in
so
far
as
is
possible
physically
one
of
them
we
should
care
little
about
the
impressions
of
a
european
studying
life
in
the
united
states
who
lived
in
his
own
tent
and
subsisted
on
canned
goods
he
brought
with
him
however
much
we
might
admire
his
foresight
it
may
be
argued
that
by
following
the
plan
i
have
outlined
i
saw
only
the
lower
class
and
do
not
report
conditions
among
the
more
fortunate
inhabitants
yet
after
all
the
peon
the
indian
the
masses
comprise
nine
tenths
of
the
population
of
south
america
there
are
fewer
persons
of
pure
european
blood
between
our
southern
boundary
and
cape
horn
than
in
the
state
of
new
york
and
by
no
means
all
of
these
live
in
even
comparative
comfort
the
minority
of
latin
america
has
often
had
its
spokesman
numerically
and
on
the
whole
the
condition
of
these
is
of
as
little
importance
in
the
general
scheme
of
things
as
are
the
doings
of
our
four
hundred
in
the
life
of
our
hundred
million
i
have
therefore
summed
up
briefly
the
ways
of
this
small
if
conspicuous
class
and
its
ways
are
so
monotonously
alike
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
latin
america
that
this
lumping
together
is
not
difficult
the
chief
problem
in
any
country
is
the
status
of
the
great
mass
of
population
the
condition
of
the
common
people
and
it
is
to
this
that
i
have
almost
entirely
confined
myself
in
the
ensuing
pages
have
you
read
s
book
on
brazintine
a
noted
french
traveler
once
asked
me
he
says
all
the
brazintinos
are
immoral
and
dishonest
you
and
i
who
have
been
there
know
this
is
true
but
those
are
things
one
tells
to
a
circle
of
friends
that
one
shares
over
a
pipe
at
the
club
enfin
ça
ne
s
écrit
it
is
due
i
suppose
to
a
lack
of
gallic
finesse
that
i
have
never
been
able
to
grasp
this
point
of
view
why
the
plain
truth
should
be
reserved
for
the
fireside
and
personal
friends
and
should
be
kept
from
one
s
friends
of
the
printed
page
is
beyond
my
fathoming
at
any
rate
i
have
made
no
attempt
to
follow
that
plan
i
tried
not
to
expect
everything
in
south
america
to
be
exactly
as
it
is
in
the
united
should
indeed
have
considered
that
a
misfortune
after
all
i
went
south
to
see
the
latin
american
as
he
is
not
with
the
hope
of
finding
him
another
american
merely
speaking
another
language
i
have
tried
to
judge
him
by
his
own
ideals
and
history
fully
aware
that
in
the
latter
he
did
not
have
a
fair
shake
rather
than
by
our
own
yet
the
traveler
can
not
entirely
lay
aside
his
native
point
of
view
that
would
imply
that
he
was
not
convinced
of
the
wisdom
of
his
own
way
of
life
and
the
question
would
arise
why
not
change
neither
the
nor
the
american
point
of
view
is
all
right
or
all
wrong
they
are
simply
different
because
we
criticize
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
we
claim
superiority
though
i
am
reminded
of
the
american
resident
in
south
america
who
asserted
that
were
he
not
convinced
of
his
superiority
to
his
neighbors
he
would
forthwith
tie
a
about
his
neck
and
jump
in
where
it
was
deep
but
the
traveler
who
does
not
express
his
own
honest
opinions
loses
as
the
brazilians
say
a
splendid
chance
to
keep
i
have
therefore
set
down
my
real
heartfelt
impressions
these
may
be
false
even
worthless
the
reader
has
full
right
to
reject
them
in
toto
but
at
least
they
have
the
virtue
of
frankness
moreover
south
america
has
had
its
fair
share
of
apologists
virtually
every
country
publishes
at
intervals
a
luxurious
volume
of
that
resembles
in
its
point
of
view
the
of
a
high
school
or
college
class
trade
journals
are
constantly
painting
things
south
american
in
the
rosiest
of
colors
it
has
been
the
traditional
policy
of
certain
branches
of
our
government
to
cultivate
friendship
by
a
myopic
disregard
of
all
the
shadows
in
the
picture
in
our
own
capital
there
exists
a
criminally
optimistic
society
for
the
propagation
of
emasculated
information
concerning
our
neighbors
to
the
south
among
distinguished
strangers
from
our
own
land
who
have
visited
latin
america
there
seems
to
have
been
a
conspiracy
to
whitewash
everything
an
agreement
to
have
all
they
see
or
experience
bathed
barbered
and
manicured
before
permitting
it
to
make
its
bow
to
our
public
the
enormous
majority
of
descriptions
of
south
america
resemble
the
original
about
as
much
as
a
portrait
resembles
the
sitter
after
a
professional
photographer
has
finished
with
it
i
do
not
know
what
the
latin
american
may
have
been
in
other
he
was
the
splendid
fellow
many
make
him
out
i
am
merely
telling
as
charitably
as
possible
how
i
found
him
i
am
not
interested
in
winning
or
losing
his
friendship
in
selling
him
goods
or
in
gaining
his
moral
support
to
our
governmental
activities
i
am
interested
only
in
giving
as
faithful
a
picture
as
possible
of
my
experiences
with
him
there
are
good
things
praiseworthy
things
in
south
america
if
in
the
telling
these
have
been
overshadowed
by
the
less
laudable
it
is
because
the
latter
do
so
overshadow
in
point
of
fact
obviously
the
experiences
of
four
years
even
in
latin
america
can
not
be
crowded
within
the
covers
of
a
volume
or
two
i
have
therefore
confined
myself
within
certain
limits
history
for
instance
has
been
almost
completely
eliminated
i
have
taken
for
granted
in
the
reader
a
certain
basic
knowledge
of
south
america
though
in
the
case
of
many
even
americans
this
seems
to
be
taking
much
for
granted
i
have
passed
as
briefly
as
possible
over
those
things
which
are
already
to
be
found
within
the
walls
of
our
libraries
confining
myself
so
far
as
possible
to
that
which
i
have
personally
seen
or
experienced
i
have
however
dipped
as
freely
into
the
literature
of
each
country
as
into
the
life
itself
and
in
the
few
cases
where
i
have
made
use
of
facts
so
acquired
i
have
not
taken
of
my
cramped
space
to
acknowledge
the
debt
in
words
for
similar
reasons
though
it
may
seem
ingratitude
i
have
not
taken
the
reader
s
time
to
thank
individuals
by
name
for
personal
kindnesses
they
were
many
but
the
doers
know
that
their
deeds
were
appreciated
without
thanks
being
detailed
here
or
if
they
do
not
it
is
the
fate
of
those
who
lend
passing
assistance
to
to
take
their
reward
in
inner
satisfaction
the
modern
reader
is
prone
to
tire
quickly
of
mere
description
but
nature
is
so
important
a
factor
in
the
andes
that
it
can
not
be
briefly
passed
over
personally
i
like
an
occasional
sunset
like
it
so
much
that
i
sometimes
go
to
the
unrequited
toil
of
attempting
to
paint
one
the
reader
who
prefers
his
stage
bare
as
in
shakespeare
s
day
can
easily
glide
over
those
pages
if
he
does
without
however
and
relies
only
on
his
imagination
his
picture
is
apt
to
be
false
for
the
imagination
has
very
faulty
materials
from
our
and
the
tales
of
wandering
münchausens
to
work
upon
yet
after
all
even
with
all
one
s
effort
it
is
sad
how
little
of
the
splendid
scenery
the
atmosphere
the
charm
of
it
in
spite
of
its
drawbacks
south
america
has
can
get
down
on
paper
this
was
not
a
voyage
of
discovery
or
rather
if
there
was
discovery
it
was
only
of
a
different
stratum
of
life
and
not
of
new
lands
my
plan
was
not
so
much
to
find
unexplored
country
in
the
ordinary
sense
as
to
go
by
hitherto
unmentioned
paths
through
inhabited
and
known
regions
the
corners
of
familiar
cities
and
the
undescribed
of
mankind
in
that
sense
south
america
is
still
chiefly
lastly
let
me
give
fair
warning
that
this
is
no
tale
of
adventures
i
would
gladly
have
had
it
otherwise
i
sought
eagerly
for
experiences
that
would
make
the
story
more
worth
the
telling
i
tried
my
sincerest
to
get
into
trouble
all
in
vain
in
mexico
i
marched
peacefully
about
between
two
falling
empires
in
guatemala
i
strolled
nonchalantly
among
estrada
cabrara
s
band
of
hired
assassins
in
honduras
i
chatted
with
the
leaders
of
the
latest
revolution
in
colombia
i
met
many
cripples
of
the
civil
war
but
recently
ended
in
ecuador
i
found
only
peace
and
apathy
in
the
very
streets
through
which
an
and
his
henchman
had
been
dragged
to
death
a
few
months
before
in
peru
all
was
love
and
after
i
left
in
the
bolivian
chaco
wild
indians
wiped
out
a
company
of
soldiers
not
a
hundred
miles
from
where
i
was
passing
in
placid
unconcern
in
the
paraguayan
capital
i
sat
with
the
man
who
not
a
year
before
had
captained
a
particularly
bloody
coup
d
état
in
brazil
i
passed
through
two
sections
virtually
in
anarchy
and
in
one
of
its
state
capitals
watched
a
riot
that
came
perilously
near
being
a
revolution
in
venezuela
i
strolled
serenely
through
the
very
ranks
of
revolters
mere
days
before
the
leader
and
many
of
his
band
were
killed
yet
hardly
once
did
i
knowingly
come
near
personal
violence
the
fact
is
that
south
america
is
atrociously
safe
dangers
are
mostly
those
of
popular
novelists
from
the
pages
of
travelers
who
succumb
to
the
natural
temptation
to
draw
the
long
bow
after
the
fashion
of
marco
polo
it
may
be
that
there
was
a
better
way
to
have
told
this
story
than
as
a
narrative
but
even
at
that
it
could
not
honestly
have
escaped
a
certain
monotony
for
monotony
is
ingrained
in
the
fiber
of
south
america
not
to
have
reported
the
journey
chronologically
would
have
made
for
succinctness
but
at
the
expense
perhaps
of
truth
it
may
be
wearisome
to
hear
of
virtually
every
night
s
yet
as
the
traveler
through
the
interior
must
stop
at
almost
every
hut
along
the
way
the
sum
total
of
these
is
a
description
of
the
whole
country
if
the
story
appears
sketchy
and
piecemeal
it
is
because
i
have
denied
myself
erroneously
perhaps
even
the
barrovian
privilege
of
transposing
or
inventing
enough
to
make
a
smoother
and
more
interesting
story
a
book
of
travel
can
not
have
something
always
happening
that
is
the
privilege
of
fiction
the
novelist
can
forge
his
materials
to
his
liking
the
is
very
limited
even
in
opportunity
to
amalgamate
his
material
being
very
hard
and
nonplastic
even
to
transpose
and
combine
incidents
is
often
to
falsify
for
what
is
true
in
one
spot
may
never
have
been
so
a
hundred
miles
further
on
the
necessity
of
suddenly
abandoning
this
task
for
other
and
more
important
duties
has
made
it
impossible
to
give
it
final
polish
to
eliminate
much
that
should
have
been
eliminated
and
to
improve
much
of
what
remains

accounts
for
old
age
amid

that
should
bring
death
early
and
often
long
before
we
reached
our
hotel
we
regretted
our
penuriousness
in
scorning
cabs
and
carriers
not
only
did
the
weight
of
our
suitcases
double
every
few
yards
in
the
leaden
tropical
air
and
the
labyrinthian
way
through
the
city
elude
us
at
every
turn
but
at
least
a
score
of
ragged
boys
trailed
respectfully
but
hopefully
in
our
rear
with
the
anticipatory
manner
of
an
opera
understudy
waiting
in
the
edge
of
the
wings
for
the
principal
to
break
down
at
the
next
note
a
generous
percentage
of
the
population
crowded
the
doorways
and
children
raced
ahead
to
summon
forth
their
families
to
behold
what
was
apparently
the
most
exciting
thing
that
had
taken
place
in
cartagena
in
months
evidently
a
bearing
his
own
material
burdens
was
a
strange
sight
in
south
america
the
populace
stared
fixedly
in
as
impersonal
a
way
as
ruminating
oxen
and
every
few
yards
children
evidently
abetted
by
their
elders
swarmed
out
upon
us
with
shrill
cries
of
wan
sheeling
we
were
soon
reminded
that
we
had
left
behind
our
power
as
well
as
our
emoluments
the
proprietress
whose
oily
hebrew
smile
greeted
us
at
the
hotel
door
was
none
other
than
one
long
wanted
on
the
zone
on
the
charge
of
running
a
disorderly
house
the
room
she
assigned
us
was
enormous
but
the
furnishings
were
scant
and
thin
the
beds
mere
strips
of
canvas
as
befits
a
country
of
perennial
midsummer
while
we
unpacked
and
shaved
a
ragged
brown
urchin
slipped
in
with
the
barranquilla
newspaper
in
a
characteristic
burst
of
generosity
hays
tossed
him
double
the

to
discover
just
after
the
vendor
was
out
of
reach

the

sheet
was
twenty
days
old

was
a

the

already
in

and
yellow

shuffled
in
frequently
supremely
indifferent
to
our
scantiness
of
attire
now
and
then
several
younger
females
of
decidedly
african
ancestry
strolled
by
as
nonchalantly
one
by
one
to
inquire
whether
we
had
any
soiled
clothes
to
wash
and
loitered
about
in
a
manner
to
suggest
that
the
question
was
meant
to
be
taken
figuratively
this
friendliness
was
the
general
attitude
of
all
the
town
outwardly
at
least
we
were
shown
no
discourtesy
and
there
was
little
confirmation
of
the
reputed
hatred
of
americans
yet
almost
from
the
moment
of
our
landing
we
noted
that
colombians
seemed
to
avoid
speaking
to
us
beyond
the
requirements
of
business
or
the
cut
and
dried
forms
of
their
habitual
politeness
still
with
only
an
anemic
candle
to
flicker
its
pale
shadows
on
the
enclosing
wall
of
the
droning
tropical
night
we
settled
down
to
the
conclusion
that
colombia
alleged
the
deadly
enemy
of
all
things
american
and
heretical
was
less
black
than
she
had
been

with
a

could
not
repress
a
millionaire
swagger
when
we
tossed
a
note
on
the
counter

pay
for
a

of
socks

quickly
wilted

was

strutted
behind
he
soon
tossed
it
away
in
disgust

newcomer

apt
to
be
startled
when
he
hears

casually
mention

for

realizes

talking

the
colombian
notes

those
of

intrinsic
value

copper

are
elaborately
engraved
and
the
wonder
grew

could
afford
to

of

the
general
inconspicuousness

artistically

gradually

canny

invited
us
to
inspect

we
soon

perhaps
just

the
matter
had
stood
when
we
sailed
once
arrived
in
cartagena
however
we
found
that
a
toy
train
left
next
day
for
calamar
on
the
magdalena
and
that
a
ticket
to
honda
wherever
that
was
cost
we
had
barely
crammed
ourselves
into
two
seats
of
the
little
car
next
day
when
hays
started
up
with
a
snort
and
thrust
the
morning
newspaper
across
at
me
done
into
english
the
item
that
had
drawn
his
attention
ran
some
one
who
merits
our
entire
confidence
informs
us
that
yesterday
there
were
in
the
city
taking
photographic
views
of
our
forts
and
most
important
edifices
two
foreign
individuals
who
wore
clothing
of
military
cut
of
the
cloth
called
and
felt
hats
with
wide
brim
this
costume
as
it
has
been
described
to
us
is
that
of
the
army
of
the
united
states
can
these
really
be
american
soldiers
or
has
a
great
outward
similarity
caused
the
suspicious
imagination
to
see
that
which
in
reality
did
not
exist
we
can
not
assure
it
we
had
hardly
aspired
to
be
taken
for
a
hostile
invasion
from
the
dreaded
colossus
of
the
it
was
characteristic
of
thinking
processes
for
the
paragrapher
to
fancy
that
such
the
item
covertly
dubbed
appear
in
uniform
we
had
yet
to
learn
however
that
the
makers
of
newspaper
and
of
public
opinion
in
so
far
as
it
exists
in
south
america
would
often
rank
in
our
own
land
as
irresponsible
and
poorly
trained
the
miniature
train
ambling
away
in
a
morning
unoppressive
in
spite
of
the
tropical
sunshine
wound
through
a
thin
jungle
sometimes
climbing
more
often
stopping
at
languorous
staring
thatched
villages
in
a
region
suffering
from
drought
but
of
fertile
appearance
by
and
by
the
jungle
gave
way
to
what
might
almost
have
been
called
prairie
slightly
rolling
and
used
only
for
grazing
toward
noon
beyond
some
swampy
land
we
clattered
into
the
carelessly
whitewashed
town
of
calamar
drowsing
on
the
sandy
bank
of
the
magdalena
here
a
half
mile
wide
even
before
we
jolted
to
a
halt
the
car
filled
with
a
struggling
mob
of
beggars
boys
and
tattered
men
eager
in
their
indolent
tropical
way
for
some
easy
errand
such
unwonted
energy
soon
evaporated
the
population
was
of
as
mongrel
a
mixture
as
the
yellow
dogs
that
slunk
about
in
the
shade
of
trees
and
house
walls
and
appeared
to
hold
identically
the
same
attitude
toward
life
at
length
in
the
cool
of
the
following
evening
the
alicia
began
to
plow
her
way
slowly
upstream
she
was
a
craft
with
a
huge
at
the
stern
her
lower
deck
crowded
with
unassorted
freight
domestic
animals
engines
and
with
deck
hands
native
passengers
pots
and
pans
and
unattractive
habits
among
the
most
conspicuous
of
the
latter
were
those
of
an
den
that
served
as
general
kitchen
twice
a
day
a
small
tub
of
rice
boiled
plantains
and
some
meat
mystery
all
cooked
in
a
single
kettle
was
carried
out
on
one
of
the
barges
alongside
where
it
was
fallen
upon
not
only
by
the
passengers
but
by
the
even
deck
hands
dressed
in
what
had
once
been
trousers
and
the
shirts
so
popular
in
this
region
a
few
owned
spoons
and
others
a
piece
of
cocoanut
shell
but
these
were
no
handicap
to
the
majority
armed
only
with
the
utensils
of
nature
little
had
we
suspected
the
meaning
of
on
the
magdalena
luckily
the
english
agent
of
the
line
had
been
so
shocked
at
sight
of
our
tickets
particularly
perhaps
in
the
hands
of
hays
who
was
in
appearance
the
hero
of
any
of
our
modern
romantic
novels
stepping
bodily
forth
from
the
cardboard
of
any
of
our
popular
illustrators
that
he
had
ordered
the
steward
to
overlook
the
color
thereof
and
treat
us
as
cabin
passengers
on
the
upper
deck
the
steamer
was
open
from
stem
to
stern
a
dining
table
stretching
along
her
center
and
the
sides
lined
by
frail
the
little
canvas
cots
narrow
as
the
of
india
used
alike
by
passengers
and
the
unlaundered
youths
that
passed
for
stewards
were
dragged
to
any
part
of
the
craft
that
suited
the
whims
of
the
sleeper
our
drinking
water
was
the
native
magdalena
sometimes
carelessly
filtered
through
a
porous
stone
there
was
even
a
the
was
elevating
enough
of
the
river
water
to
permit
it
to
function
it
generally
took
most
of
the
morning
and
all
the
stewards
to
find
the
misplaced
key
frequently
for
days
at
a
time
there
were
only
the
two
of
us
to
occupy
the
cane
that
embellished
the
upper
foredeck
here
day
after
day
we
watched
the
monotonous
yellow
bank
unroll
with
infinite
slowness
like
a
film
clogged
in
the
machine
the
country
flat
considerably
wooded
and
characterless
stood
only
a
few
feet
above
the
river
its
soil
sandy
though
not
without
fertility
with
occasional
clearings
and
many
immense
spreading
trees
here
and
there
on
the
extreme
edge
of
the
stream
hung
a
few
scattered
thatched
villages
all
apparently
engaged
in
the
favorite
occupation
of
doing
nothing
living
on
the
few
fruits
and
vegetables
that
grew
themselves
and
drinking
the
yellow
magdalena
pure
at
such
times
there
was
nothing
left
but
to
while
away
the
languid
hours
in
perfecting
our
plans
for
the
journey
ahead
for
once
i
had
chanced
upon
a
traveling
companion
who
had
actually
started
when
the
hour
of
departure
came
and
who
bade
fair
to
pursue
the
expedition
to
the
bitter
end
leo
hays
had
first
seen
the
as
it
is
in
months
later
than
i
but
had
overcome
that
initial
handicap
by
deflecting
the
sun
s
rays
in
many
a
varying
clime
the
schools
had
early
scowled
upon
he
upon
he
had
retaliated
by
gathering
in
his
own
way
much
that
schools
have
never
hoarded
away
in
their
impregnable
warehouses
the
gleaning
had
carried
him
far
afield
in
social
strata
as
well
as
physical
distance
but
it
had
left
him
unburdened
with
the
of
life
so
dear
to
the
bourgeois
soul
wasteful
of
money
and
the
petty
things
of
life
he
was
never
wasteful
of
life
itself
he
was
of
those
who
look
at
the
world
through
a
lens
there
is
a
breadth
of
vision
gained
in
an
existence
varying
from
hobo
printer
and
editor
in
our
pulsating
southwest
to
sugar
estate
overseer
in
the
guianas
from
the
forecastle
to
the
moro
villages
of
the
philippines
that
makes
a
formal
education
seem
cramped
and
restricted
by
comparison
to
those
who
did
not
know
the
canal
zone
in
its
halcyon
days
a
mere
corporal
of
police
demanding
of
himself
the
ability
to
converse
intelligently
a
half
hour
on
any
subject
from
astronomy
to
norse
literature
from
heraldry
to
urdu
philosophy
may
seem
a
fantastic
figure
to
the
experienced
zoner
it
is
commonplace
on
sunday
morning
the
entire
village
of
zambrano
headed
by
its
curate
and
dressed
in
every
imaginable
misfit
of
gaiety
swarmed
on
board
and
subjected
us
to
a
leisurely
detailed
examination
that
gave
us
the
sensation
of
being
museum
exhibits
the
alicia
was
soon
off
again
and
we
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
town
was
migrating
en
masse
a
few
hundred
yards
beyond
however
we
tied
up
to
the
bank
once
more
and
waited
a
long
hour
while
all
zambrano
took
leave
of
the
priest
every
inhabitant
under
fifteen
kissed
his
hand
which
each
of
the
women
pressed
fervently
some
several
times
over
after
which
the
men
approached
him
in
procession
padre
and
layman
throwing
an
arm
about
each
other
s
neck
and
slapping
each
other
some
seven
times
each
between
the
it
was
only
the
customary
colombian
and
the
formality
of
seeing
the
curate
a
little
way
on
his
journey
meanwhile
our
boy
captain
stood
smilingly
by
twisting
the
two
tiny
sprigs
of
mustache
that
gave
him
so
striking
a
resemblance
to
a
chinese
mandarin
turned
river
pirate
he
was
far
too
good
a
catholic
to
cut
short
the
even
had
he
guessed
that
anyone
on
board
chaffed
at
the
delay
the
day
was
much
older
before
we
crawled
out
into
the
middle
of
the
stream
again
but
no
man
journeys
up
to
bogotá
hastily
the
land
of
hurry
was
behind
us
when
we
addressed
him
the
priest
answered
us
courteously
enough
then
dropped
the
conversation
in
a
manner
to
suggest
that
he
did
not
care
to
pursue
it
further
like
his
in
general
he
seemed
to
have
no
hunger
for
knowledge
no
notion
that
he
might
learn
from
others
the
attitude
of
all
the
passengers
was
as
if
an
edict
had
gone
forth
to
dislike
americans
individually
none
had
any
grievance
against
us
collectively
they
seemed
banded
together
in
a
species
of
intellectual
boycott
which
none
of
them
vented
to
the
extent
of
losing
his
reputation
for
politeness
their
manner
suggested
pouting
children
unwilling
to
declare
their
fancied
grievances
and
fight
them
out
like
men
there
were
a
half
dozen
of
us
at
table
that
evening
with
the
priest
in
the
place
of
honor
at
the
head
the
meal
passed
without
a
spoken
word
at
racehorse
speed
it
recalled
a
placard
i
had
seen
in
a
texas
restaurant
on
my
journey
southward
eat
first
then
talk
and
amid
the
opening
chorus
hays
memory
harked
back
to
a
sign
that
once
embellished
a
bowery
institution
soup
should
be
seen
and
not
that
we
paused
for
speech
between
mouthfuls
seemed
to
fill
our
companions
with
a
mixture
of
disgust
and
amazement
it
was
perilous
too
for
ragged
barefooted
waiters
more
numerous
than
the
diners
hovered
over
us
quick
to
snatch
away
the
plate
of
anyone
who
dared
raise
his
head
how
unlike
the
sociable
meals
of
spain
was
this
silent
wolfing
their
own
parents
could
not
have
distinguished
one
meal
from
another
the
soup
was
always
of
the
general
collection
variety
the
two
vegetables
incessantly
the
same
the
beef
varied
from
the
hopelessly
tough
to
the
suspiciously
tender
for
the
system
on
the
river
steamers
of
the
magdalena
is
to
slaughter
a
steer
on
the
lower
deck
the
first
morning
of
the
voyage
and
serve
it
twice
daily
until
passengers
are
unanimous
in
leaving
their
plates
untouched
then
regretfully
to
lead
another
gloomy
animal
forth
to
slaughter
yet
no
one
could
have
complained
on
the
score
of
quantity
we
no
longer
wondered
at
the
sallow
flabbiness
of
those
about
us
in
spite
of
their
life
in
the
open
air
the
voracious
engines
of
the
alicia
required
more
halting
than
movement
barely
had
we
left
the
faint
lights
of
calamar
astern
when
we
tied
up
for
hours
before
a
woodpile
in
the
edge
of
the
jungle
and
never
did
a
half
day
pass
without
a
long
halt
to
replenish
the
fuel
the
sight
of
a
bamboo
hut
or
a
cluster
of
thatched
shacks
crouched
in
a
little
semicircular
space
gouged
out
of
the
immense
forest
was
sure
to
bring
a
shrill
scream
from
the
whistle
and
in
the
soft
air
of
evening
we
crawled
up
to
a
tiny
clearing
where
perhaps
thirty
cords
of
wood
lay
awaiting
a
purchaser
they
were
heavy
slabs
some
three
feet
long
the
piles
separated
by
upright
poles
into
divisions
called
the
conventional
load
perhaps
of
one
ass
on
the
utter
edge
of
the
bank
hung
a
miserable
little
hut
swarming
with
dogs
and
equally
unwashed
human
beings
there
were
the
usual
endless
manoeuvers
to
a
mooring
then
the
entire
crew
went
ashore
on
the
heels
of
the
captain
armed
with
his
measuring
stick
he
and
the
woodsman
a
sturdy
bashful
fellow
gave
each
other
the
customary
greeting
pat
on
the
shoulder
then
stood
a
long
time
each
with
a
hand
on
the
woodpile
discussing
the
details
of
the
imminent
financial
transaction
but
they
could
not
come
to
terms
and
at
length
the
steamer
population
returned
on
board
and
for
ten
minutes
with
much
ringing
of
bells
and
screeching
of
whistles
the
alicia
went
through
the
pretence
of
getting
under
way
the
woodsman
held
his
ground
though
his
wood
looked
as
if
he
had
already
held
it
several
years
at
length
we
returned
to
the
same
mooring
and
a
of
boiled
beef
and
plantains
was
carried
ashore
as
a
peace
offering
this
time
we
struck
a
bargain
and
the
two
populations
exchanged
places
the
countrymen
of
all
ages
and
both
sexes
many
with
evidences
of
loathsome
diseases
one
limping
on
a
foot
white
with
leprosy
swarmed
into
every
corner
of
the
craft
gazing
at
her
unbelievable
magnificence
sitting
cautiously
down
in
the
deck
chairs
thrusting
their
fingers
into
the
saucers
of
dessert
that
had
been
set
out
an
hour
or
two
before
meal
time
to
give
the
flies
fair
play
passing
from
hand
to
hand
anything
that
caught
their
fancy
their
protruding
bellies
suggested
that
the
hookworm
was
prevalent
the
men
wore
over
one
shoulder
a
pouch
called
a
for
their
clothing
was
not
such
as
might
safely
have
been
entrusted
with
their
minor
possessions
meanwhile
we
had
taken
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
stretch
our
legs
ashore
for
whatever
their
faults
these
jungle
people
are
not
addicted
to
thievery
under
the
edge
of
the
forest
into
the
dense
green
depths
of
which
we
could
wander
a
little
way
amid
a
wealth
of
woodland
aromas
and
the
fitful
songs
of
birds
was
planted
a
little
field
of
corn
the
stalks
a
full
ten
feet
high
even
the
ears
in
many
cases
well
above
our
heads
though
the
jungle
was
thick
between
the
rows
and
there
was
no
sign
of
other
labor
than
the
planting
a
bit
of
sugarcane
grew
as
luxuriantly
and
behind
the
hut
stood
a
crude
or
cane
crusher
a
mere
stump
and
lever
above
a
trough
palm
gourd
mango
and
papaya
trees
the
females
of
the
latter
heavy
with
fruit
and
the
males
gay
with
yellow
blossoms
suggested
that
the
spot
might
have
been
one
of
the
most
flourishing
gardens
on
earth
had
the
inhabitants
any
other
industry
or
desire
than
to
roll
about
on
their
earth
floors
from
a
corner
of
the
patch
the
stewards
cut
long
reeds
and
made
trumpets
of
exactly
the
sound
of
army
bugles
the
houses
of
the
region
are
very
simply
built
four
posts
some
six
inches
in
diameter
and
rising
as
many
feet
above
the
ground
are
set
at
the
corners
of
the
house
to
be
halfway
between
these
are
set
four
smaller
upright
poles
giving
each
wall
three
supports
along
the
tops
of
these
saplings
about
four
inches
in
diameter
are
tied
with
green
vines
after
which
pole
rafters
are
raised
across
these
six
to
eight
inches
apart
are
laid
strips
of
split
bamboo
also
tied
with
vines
the
roof
is
then
thatched
with
dried
banana
leaves
laid
lengthwise
with
the
slope
of
the
roof
those
underneath
secured
by
being
bent
over
the
bamboo
strips
and
layer
after
layer
of
them
piled
on
until
the
thatch
is
a
foot
or
more
thick
two
poles
tied
some
distance
apart
with
green
vines
are
then
thrown
over
the
peak
of
the
roof
to
keep
a
sudden
gust
of
wind
from
lifting
the
shelter
off
the
dwellers

and
the
residence

ready
for
occupancy
the
deck
hands
each
wearing
on
his
head
a
grain
sack
split
up
one
side
stood
in
file
beside
the
diminishing
woodpile
when
his
turn
came
each
grasped
the
end
of
his
sack
in
the
right
hand
and
held
the
arm
at
full
length
while
others
heaped
it
high
with
cordwood
as
soon
as
he
had
what
he
considered
a
reasonable
amount
the
carrier
threw
a
rope
held
in
his
left
hand
over
the
load
caught
it
deftly
in
the
already
burdened
right
and
pulling
it
taut
marched
down
some
twenty
feet
of
perpendicular
sandy
bank
and
across
a
wobbly
plank
without
a
quiver
we
envied
them
the
exercise
at
every
landing
but
even
to
have
carried
a
stick
on
board
would
have
been
not
only
to
lose
our
own
caste
but
to
jeopardize
that
of
all
our
nothing
would
be
more
futile
than
to
attempt
to
describe
the
tropical
sunset
exceeded
in
beauty
if
at
all
only
by
sunrise
as
it
spread
across
this
flat
jungle
and
forest
country
the
curving
river
and
woodlands
on
into
the
night
the
languid
wood
loading
continued
lighted
up
in
irregular
patches
by
the
lamps
of
the
steamer
and
flickering
oil
torches
ashore
long
after
dark
as
the
last
of
the
was
disappearing
the
jungle
dweller
came
on
board
in
person
and
fixed
upon
me
to
figure
up
how
much
he
had
coming
openly
putting
his
faith
in
a
foreigner
in
preference
to
a
native
there
were
burros
for
which
he
was
to
receive
fourteen
cents
each
it
totalled
or
as
it
sounded
to
him
and
by
and
by
the
purser
who
would
no
doubt
have
beaten
him
a
few
hundred
dollars
in
the
multiplication
but
for
my
pencil
came
out
of
his
cabin
with
an
australian
gold
sovereign
and
an
immense
handful
of
colombian
bills
i
asked
the
recipient
how
long
he
had
worked
to
get
the
pile
together
and
received
the
expected
south

suns
which
of
course
was
as
exact
as
he
could
be
about
it
strangely
enough
he
resisted
the
wheedling
of
the
ragged
stewards
to
exchange
his
fortune
for
the
cheap
straw
hats
and
brass
rings
they
carried
for
sale
and
got
safely
ashore
with
the
entire
handful
of
what
in
these
wilds
could
not
have
been
of
any
great
practical
value
as
we
pushed
off
the
captain
announced
that
we
had
wood
enough
to
last
until
the
following
noon
one
would
have
fancied
we
had
enough
to
last
to
the
seventh
circle
and
back
here
we
could
still
march
all
night
for
the
river
was
deep
in
spite
of
its
great
width
as
we
sat
in
solitary
glory
on
the
upper
deck
watching
the
moon
come
up
out
of
the
jungle
hays
suddenly
broke
off
a
dissertation
on
the
philosophy
of
life
of
marcus
aurelius
to
exclaim
we
ought
to
swear
off
on
this
if
we
re
going
to
walk
along
the
top
of
the
andes
we
ll
need
all
the
chest
expansion
we
ve
got
and
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
he
chucked
his
cigar
overboard
it
was
not
until
late
next
morning
that
i
saw
him
light
the
next
one
but
i
thought
you
d
sworn
off
i
reminded
him
that
s
the
great
value
of
resolutions
he
answered
you
make
them
to
break
them
and
feel
the
genuine
freedom
of
life
but
i
ll
swear
off
in
earnest
he
did
almost
daily
as
long
as
the
journey
lasted
meanwhile
my
birthday
making
a
good
date
for
it
i
gave
up
the
habit
definitely
myself
none
too
sure
of
its
effect
in
the
lofty
altitudes
before
us
we
moved
at
about
the
speed
of
a
towed
by
a
sunfish
whenever
there
was
danger
of
our
making
a
reasonable
colombian
distance
the
whistle
was
sure
to
sound
and
we
drifted
inshore
to
tie
up
for
hours
before
another
woodpile
sometimes
the
flat
disappointing
banks
of
the
river
were
sheer
for
miles
with
unbroken
stretches
of
swamp
grass
six
feet
high
so
dense
it
did
not
seem
that
a
snake
could
have
wormed
its
way
through
it
the
cerulean
blue
skies
were
equal
to
any
of
italy
the
light
clouds
wandering
lazily
across
them
sometimes
forming
in
battle
array
on
the
rim
of
the
horizon
here
and
there
were
considerable
fields
of
sugarcane
about
a
thatched
village
but
the
vast
fertile
territory
was
almost
entirely
virgin
and
uncleared
one
morning
a
cry
of
caimán
called
attention
to
a
point
of
sand
on
which
lay
a
score
of
alligators
most
of
which
slid
sluggishly
off
into
the
stream
as
we
approached
thereafter
we
had
only
to
glance
along
the
banks
to
be
almost
sure
of
seeing
several
for
some
days
hays
and
i
had
made
up
the
deck
passenger
list
unassisted
sitting
through
our
meals
in
dignified
silence
with
some
waiters
to
miswait
on
we
could
get
their
by
the
chief
steward
who
never
tired
of
boasting
that
he
had
once
made
cigars
in
the
shadow
of
ancon
police
station
his
underlings
received
six
dollars
a
month
such
food
as
they
could
forage
and
the
right
to
wear
what
the
passage
of
years
had
left
of
misfit
cotton
uniforms
to
be
turned
in
at
the
end
of
the
trip
they
were
obliged
to
pay
for
all
breakages
and
life
was
indeed
slender
with
only
two
economical
gringos
as
passengers
the
arrival
of
a
new
was
in
consequence
always
an
exciting
event
five
days
up
in
the
region
known
as
the
opón
country
there
appeared
on
board
a
native
trapper
of
wild
animals
who
had
been
shot
through
the
face
by
an
arrow
of
the
savage
opones
but
had
performed
the
rare
feat
of
making
his
escape
colombia

within
her
confines
several
tribes
of
indians
not
only
uninfluenced
by
the
government
but
without
an
inkling
of
its
existence
the
opones
live
far
back
along
the
tributaries
of
the
magdalena
descending
them
only
in
certain
seasons
and
attacking
any
human
beings
they
come
upon

shoot
an
enormous
arrow
with

point
of
black
palm
barbed
both
ways
that
can
neither
be
pushed
through
nor
pulled
out
of
the
body
of
the
victim
the
arrow
the
trapper
brought
with
him
could
barely
be
forced
into
his
long
trunk
after
being
broken
in
two
and
five
cruel
barbs
still
remained
after
several
others
had
been
cut
off
and
left
in
the
body
of
his
former
companion
a
few
weeks
before
he
reported
a
harmless
fellow
fishing
somewhat
back
from
the
main
river
had
been
made
the
veritable
pincushion
of
such
arrows
the
trapper
had
it
that
the
opones
were
cannibals
asserting
that
a
recent
expedition
into
the
opón
country
had
found
a
colombian
woman
of
good
family
who
was
being
fattened
in
a
cage
of
bamboo
but
whom
the
savages
had
not
yet
eaten
because
of
a
suspicious
sore
on
her
leg

mountains
began
to
appear
in
the
far
blue
distance
with
suggestions
of
higher
ones
in
the
clouds
behind
them
on
the
seventh
day
a
long
rugged
chain
the
sierra
de
peraja
in
the
province
of
santander
had
grown
so
near
that
separate
peaks
and
suggestions
of
villages
could
be
picked
out
of
the
sunlit
distance
next
morning
we
were
half
surrounded
by
deep
blue
ranges
and
the
banks
were
broad
natural
meadows
with
hundreds
of
cattle
in
rich
green
grass
magnificent
spreading
trees
now
stood
out
against
the
sky
and
ranges
the
nights
had
grown
so
cool
that
we
took
to
sleeping
in
our
stateroom
barely
room
enough
left
to
sneeze
when
our
cots
had
been
dragged
in
here
we
began
to
go
aground
frequently
for
the
tendency
of
the
magdalena
is
to
spread
out
more
and
more
as
her
sandy
banks
keep
falling
into
the
river
at
our
speed
the
experience
was
hardly
and
generally
in
the
course
of
a
few
hours
the
alicia
worked
herself
loose
again
there
were
almost
no
other
water
craft
except
an
occasional
a
log
crawling
along
the
extreme
lower
edge
of
the
forest
wall
now
and
then
we
passed
large
rafts
of
hundreds
of
immense
cedar
logs
with
the
colombian
flag
at
the
prow
and
the
crew
camped
aft
with
mat
beds
primitive
kitchens
and
sometimes
their
women
and
a
numerous
progeny
great
trees
which
the
captain
called
rose
slim
and
clear
more
than
a
hundred
feet
to
end
in
a
parasol
tuft
of
branches
frequently
a
flock
of
parrakeets
screamed
noisily
by
overhead
in
places
we
crawled
along
between
sheer
sand
banks
gigantic
trees
of
the
dense
forest
hanging
on
the
brink
of
miniature
culebra
slides
as
the
river
washed
under
them
higher
still
the
stream
grew
so
shallow
that
we
could
march
only
by
day
anchoring
at
dark
one
night
we
tied
up
to
the
bank
on
an
inner
curve
of
the
river
where
the
forest
cut
off
the
breeze
completely
and
left
us
to
toss
in
our
cots
until
dawn
its
first
glimmer
of
light
showed
that
we
had
reached
pureto
berrío
where
a
little
use
the
word
advisedly
for
it
never
gets
medellín
second
city
of
colombia
the
port
itself
suspended
whatever
it
was
in
the
habit
of
doing
to
stare
at
us
in
long
silent
rows
from
the
doorways
its
male
population
not
only
wore
no
shirt
but
did
not
even
trouble
to
conceal
that
fact
by
buttoning
its
tattered
jacket
all
the
natives
seemed
obsessed
with
the
notion
that
as
gringos
we
could
not
speak
spanish
as
often
as
we
addressed
one
though
our
castilian
vocabulary
was
as
ample
and
our
pronunciation
far
less
slovenly
than
his
own
he
refused
to
believe
his
senses
until
the
sensation
had
been
several
times
repeated
we
were
off
again
by
noon
it
had
been
raining
in
the
highlands
beyond
and
the
visibly
rising
river
was
half
covered
with
patches
of
thick
scum
now
and
then
it
bore
by
on
its
swift
silent
surface
a
fragment
of
forest
snatched
from
somewhere
above
we
were
now
some
hundreds
of
feet
above
and
the
forest
air
was
fragrant
and
unfevered
all
day
long
nothing
but
forest
trailed
by
we
passed
timber
enough
in
a
week
to
supply
the
world
for
a
century
and
rich
soil
enough
to
feed
a
large
section
of
it
permanently
but
only
very
rarely
did
a
little
bamboo
hut
roofed
with
leaves
dot
the
monotony
of
virgin
nature
the
river
had
narrowed
down
to
a
placid
powerful
stream
the
weather
was
peerless
though
an
almost
invisible
gnat
began
to
make
life
less
motionless
in
the
purple
gloaming
a
village
of
some
size
stood
out
more
picturesquely
than
usual
on
the
nose
of
a
land
billow
jutting
forth
and
falling
sheer
into
the
river
only
to
have
the
interminable
forest
swallow
it
up
again
yet
there
were
signs
that
we
were
approaching
somewhere
or
other
hays
sat
with
his
feet
on
the
rail
discoursing
on
the
relative
merits
of
turgeniev
and
galdós
the
point
of
his
last
cigar
glowing
in
the
darkness
when
the
captain
passed
with
a
package
wrapped
in
the
customary
inefficiency
of
here
i
used
to
be
one
said
hays
reaching
for
the
bundle
and
rearranging
it
used
to
be
what
i
asked
as
he
handed
it
back
i
was
walking
along
the
street
i
don
t
remember
the
stage
setting
but
it
must
have
been
in
the
states
and
a
long
time
ago
he
began
lighting
a
second
cigar
from
the
butt
of
the
first
for
i
know
i
hadn
t
been
to
sea
or
in
the
army
yet
when
i
saw
a
sign
in
a
window
bundle
wrapper
i
had
to
pass
up
a
hundred
per
as
outside
man
for
a
medicine
faker
to
take
it
but
it
was
something
new
and
and
he
rambled
off
into
one
of
those
experience
sketches
which
jumping
erratically
over
the
face
of
the
globe
frequently
enlivened
the
voyage
in
the
last
hours
of
june
we
bumped
against
the
wharf
of
la
dorada
several
hundred
yards
of
tinware
building
along
a
sloping
river
front
with
a
childish
attempt
at
paving
its
main
street
a
forlorn
pathway
near
the
water
s
edge
dying
away
in
the
on
either
hand
here
we
took
our
leave
of
the
alicia
for
cataracts
make
this
the
end
of
the
run
for
steamers
plying
the
lower
magdalena
next
afternoon
a
train
even
more
diminutive
than
that
to
calamar
wound
away
in
a
half
circle
into
the
forest
with
now
and
then
glimpses
of
hazy
andean
ranges
and
three
hours
later
set
us
down
in
honda
to
our
surprise
we
found
it
a
city
the
first
since
cartagena
as
aged
and
intricate
as
full
of
its
own
local
color
including
many
blind
and
leprous
beggars
as
any
town
of
old
spain
piled
close
along
the
magdalena
here
a
series
of
rocky
rapids
it
is
divided
by
a
gurgling
tributary
across
which
three
picturesque
bridges
fling
themselves
scores
of
aged
stone
buildings
quaint
walls
and
steep
streets
of
pavements
give
it
an
air
reminiscent
of
bruges
or
nürnberg
or
of
some
of
the
ancient
towns
of
mexico
its
narrow
streets
are
crowded
with
laden
mules
and
sunbrowned
arrieros
of
both
sexes
its
patios
seem
primeval
forests
and
mountain
ranges
cut
its
horizon
close
off
in
every
direction
a
muleteer
pointed
out
to
us
the
ancient
trail
to
bogotá
where
it
crossed
a
high
red
bridge
and
climbed
steeply
away
up
one
of
the
natural
walls
of
the
town
on
the
way
to
facatativá
on
the
lofty
plateau
above
but
for
our
baggage
we
should
have
struck
out
for
the
capital

this
route

end
of
the

line
and
beginning
of
the
railroad
to
bogotá
we
went
on
by
rail
in
the
morning
every
woman
and
girl
in
the
to
mention
smoking
the
cigars
of
the
region
the
little
engine
with
its
topheavy
smokestack
consumed
wood
as
gluttonously
as
the
alicia
and
halted
even
more
often
to
replenish
its
supply
colombians
fancy
railroads
will
work
the
complete
regeneration
of
their
torpid
country
but
such
as
we
had
seen
were
only
miniature
samples
of
the
real
thing
of
slight
practical
value
even
were
they
extended
all
over
the
republic
the
natives
had
no
notion
however
that
the
word
train
did
not
stand
for
the
same
tiny
contraptions
the
world
over
as
that
to
which
they
applied
it
on
all
sides
were
enormous
stadiums
of
mountains
not
yet
high
but
already
bulking
and
drought
had
left
the
country
and
fine
sand
drifted
in
and
deposited
itself
upon
us
in
shrouds
as
in
crossing
nevada
the
landscape
suggested
a
cross
between
the
tropics
and
a
western
prairie
choking
for
rain
as
did
even
the
towns
with
their
frontiersman
disarray
their
burros
mules
and
horses
drooping
in
any
patch
of
shade
tattered
boys
and
diseased
loafers
swarmed
into
the
cars
at
every
stop
drinking
from
the
water
jars
washing
in
the
bowls
of
the
coach
making
themselves
completely
at
home
without
a
suggestion
of
protest
from
the
trainmen
even
were
there
laws
against
such
actions
the
languid
officials
would
have
lacked
the
moral
courage
to
enforce
them
the
railway
ended
at
beltrán
where
we
boarded
the
steamer
a
dreary
collection
of
sheds
and
a
few
choking
huts
made
up
the
town
completely
surrounded
by
desert
with
plenty
of
bushy
trees
but
a
desert
for
all
that
the
wind
that
swept
across
the
steamer
at
her
mooring
was
not
the
cool
one
of
the
lower
magdalena
but
one
laden
with
sands
that
stung
the
cheeks
like
tiny
insects
when
the
passengers
had
gulped
their
the
dishes
were
piled
in
the
alleyway
where
beggars
and
gaunt
boys
from
the
shore
came
to
claw
around
in
them
after
which
they
were
roughly
there
is
a
fetching
democracy
about
the
road
to
bogotá
he
who
travels
it
be
he
vagrant
or
man
of
wealth
must
go
through
the
same
uninviting
experiences
it
speaks
poorly
of
colombians
that
they
still
endure
this
medieval
method
of
travel
from
the
outside
world
to
their
capital
wealthy
journey
to
europe
in
luxurious
they
are
on
the
ocean
it
would
seem
wiser
for
them
to
return
steerage
and
gradually
accustom
themselves
to
what
they
must
endure
from
the
landing
in
their
own
country
to
the
arrival
in
bogotá
all
day
long
we
sat
in
the
winds
of
beltrán
while
barefoot
and
stevedores
dribbled
down
the
steep
bank
with
all
manner
of
cargo
there
was
barbed
wire
from
massachusetts
corrugated
iron
from
pittsburg
boxed
lines
that
clattered
and
crashed
as
they
fell
and
finally
though
by
no
means
last
four
pianos
from
germany
that
were
rolled
heels
over
head
down
the
long
stony
bank
although
we
had
real
cabin
tickets
this
time
neither
of
us
had
influence
enough
to
get
a
cabin
we
dragged
our
cots
out
on
the
open
deck
and
indifferent
to
social
rules
marched
through
the
multitude
in
our
pajamas
this
turned
out
to
be
entirely
comme
il
faut
for
even
the
son
of
a
recent
president
of
colombia
soon
appeared
similarly
clad
and
strolled
about
the
deck
chattering
with
his
of
both
sexes
as
nonchalantly
as
if
in
full
dress
we
were
not
off
until
dawn
into
which
the
volcano
ruiz
first
of
the
long
row
of
of
the
andes
which
we
hoped
in
time
to
see
disappear
over
our
shoulders
thrust
its
aged
head
rock
cliffs
along
the
banks
recalled
the
lorelei
fields
of
corn
undulated
like
hair
on
the
summits
of
rounded
hills
at
the
base
of
which
sweltered
the
banana
groves
of
the
tropics
as
the
sun
was
setting
we
passed
a
at
the
foot
of
a
low
range
around
which
the
river
had
swept
in
a
so
many
centuries
that
its
bank
was
a
sheer
rock
wall
surely
sixty
feet
high
the
caribe
with
the
nose
of
a
washtub
panted
for
life
against
the
current
spitting
showers
of
live
coals
from
her
wood
fires
seeming
several
times
about
to
give
up
the
attempt
in
despair
but
she
gained
the
calmer
water
above
at
last
and
soon
after
dark
landed
us
in
jirardot
we
spent
the
fourth
of
july
in
jirardot
not
by
choice
but
because
the
train
to
the
capital
leaves
only
three
times
a
week
the
town
swelters
by
day
on
the
edge
of
the
curving
river
here
hardly
fifty
yards
wide
where
for
more
than
a
mile
stretches
a
vista
of
donkeys
laden
with
kegs
of
water
bands
of
women
all
more
or
less
african
in
ancestry
bathing
washing
and
incessantly
smoking
immense
misshapen
cigars
as
do
even
the
children
of
both
sexes
that
paddle
stark
naked
about
the
bank
in
complete
immunity
to
the
blazing
sun
the
place
seemed
the
headquarters
of
contented
poverty
at
least
half
the
inhabitants
either
had
not
enough
garments
to
completely
conceal
their
dusky
skins
or
had
laid
them
away
for
more
gala
occasions
beggars
halt
blind
misformed
and
idiotic
were
almost
as
numerous
as
in
similar
towns
of
india
even
the
less
miserable
inhabitants
were
dull
neurasthenic
utterly
devoid
of
energy
anemics
with
incessant
smoking
bad
food
and
worse
habits
given
to
living
entirely
according
to
their
appetites
and
never
according
to
will
power
and
reason
it
was
not
without
misgiving
that
we
turned
our
faces
toward
bogotá
next
morning
the
crowd
which
the
train
from
the
plateau
had
landed
the
night
before
had
been
half
hidden
under
the
rugs
blankets
and
overcoats
they
carried
and
not
a
native
of
jirardot
could
speak
of
the
capital
without
visibly
shivering
some
even
crossing
themselves
as
often
as
they
heard
it
mentioned
the
train
left
at
sunrise
by
the
rules
of
the
ferrocarril
de
jirardot
were
obliged
to
check
our
baggage
containing
all
extra
clothing
for
the
first
few
hours
we
were
surrounded
by
mountains
though
still
on
a
slightly
rising
plain
between
them
the
land
appeared
fertile
and
there
was
considerable
indian
corn
yet
it
was
surprising
to
find
here
in
the
capacious
new
world
such
swarms
of
beggars
as
in
egypt
or
india
the
population
along
the
way
increasingly
indian
in
blood
was
extraordinarily
in
a
window
near
us
sat
a
commercial
traveler
who
tossed
at
every
one
he
caught
sight
of
along
the
way
a
pictorial
advertisement
of
an
american
panacea
the
tail
of
the
train
was
always
well
past
them
before
a
single
one
gathered
his
wits
sufficiently
to
pick
up
the
treasure
near
noon
we
were
ourselves
picked
out
by
a
engine
made
in
schenectady
its
boiler
well
forward
and
flanked
by
the
water
tanks
a
small
upright
coalbin
behind
as
we
began
a
series
of
switchbacks
i
caught
a
breath
of
virile
white
man
s
air
for
the
first
time
in
a
half
year
and
the
taste
of
it
was
so
delicious
that
the
sensation
reached
to
my
tingling
toes
regularly
the
vista
of
valleys
surrounded
by
cool
blue
ranges
spread
to
greater
distances
passengers
began
to
turn
to
put
on
overcoats
blankets
rugs
ponchos
gloves
to
wrap
towels
about
their
necks
to
me
the
temperature
was
delightful
but
hays
who
had
been
long
years
in
the
tropics
took
to
applying
other
adjectives
now
the
landscape
of
meadows
and
grazing
cattle
backed
by
towering
mountains
suggested
switzerland
beyond
the
one
tunnel
of
the
line
we
entered
an
immense
valley
walled
by
row
upon
row
of
blue
ranges
higher
still
the
bleak
stony
highlands
resembled
a
more
rugged
scotland
in
late
october
though
cultivation
was
almost
general
and
roads
numerous
it
struck
us
as
strange
that
human
beings
should
shiver
and
toil
for
a
scant
livelihood
in
such
surroundings
when
a
day
s
walk
would
bring
them
to
perpetual
summer
and
nature
s
well
filled
larder
a
plant
must
remain
where
it
chances
to
be
born
but
why
should
man
also
by
four
the
train
had
finished
its
task
of
lifting
its
breathless
passengers
into
the
thin
air
of
facatativá
and
scores
of
barefoot
children
and
ragged
adults
dismally
wandered
the
stony
streets
a
policeman
muffled
to
the
ears
assured
us
with
what
seemed
a
suggestion
of
pride
that
facatativá
was
even
colder
than
bogotá
for
which
hays
gave
fervent
thanks
evidently
the
heat
of
the
tropics
was
yet
in
my
blood
for
i
still
felt
comfortable
an
hour
later
we
were
speeding
across
a
broad
plateau
by
the
ferrocarril
de
la
sabana
a
government
railroad
equipped
with
real
trains
of
american
cars
all
the
languor
and
ragged
indifference
of
the
tropics
seemed
to
have
been
left
forever
behind
the
conductor
was
as
as
light
in
any
in
our
own
land
we
stopped
briefly
at
towns
boasting
all
the
adjuncts
of
civilized
life
somehow
dragged
up
to
these
lofty
realms
here
was
a
country
built
from
the
center
outwardly
the
nearer
we
came
to
its
capital
the
further
we
left
the
world
behind
the
more
modern
and
well
furnished
did
it
become
it
recalled
fanciful
tales
of
men
who
toiling
for
weeks
through
unknown

suddenly
burst
forth
upon
an
unknown
valley
filled
with
all
the
splendors
of
an
ancient
kingdom

indian

and

are

chief
of
the
colombian
capital
yet
we
could
not
but
wonder
why
once
they
had
reached
this
lofty
plateau
the
discoverers
had
not
halted
and
built
their
city
instead
of
marching
far
back
across
it
to
the
foot
of
the
enclosing
range
a
full
miles
the
train
fled
across
the
an
immense
plain
in
appearance
like
one
of
our
north
in
early
april
intersected
here
and
there
by
fences
broad
yellow
fields
of
mustard
appeared
spread
and
disappeared
behind
us
great
droves
of
cattle
frisked
about
in
the
autumn
air
as
if
to
keep
warm
country
dwellings
flashed
by
stony
and
bare
in
setting
but
embellished
with
huge
paintings
of
landscapes
on
the
walls
under
the
veranda
roofs
the
sun
had
barely
smiled
upon
us
since
noon
now
as
the
day
declined
i
began
to
grow
cold
bitter
cold
colder
than
i
had
been
since
descending
from
the
mexican
plateau
seven
months
before
while
hays
hat
brim
shook
with
his
shivering
our
looked
like
summer
excursionists
unexpectedly
caught
in
straw
hats
by
grim
relentless
winter
then
as
evening
descended
the
plain
came
abruptly
to
an
end
and
at
the
very
foot
of
a
forbidding
black
mountain
range
spread
a
cold
smokeless
city
of
bulking
domes
and
towers
we
had
reached
at
last
after
eighteen
days
of
travel
the
most
isolated
of
south
american
capitals
chapter
ii
the
cloistered
city
our
entrance
into
bogotá
was
not
exactly
what
we
had
planned
or
anticipated
the
crowd
that
filled
the
station
and
its
adjacent
streets
in
honor
of
the
linking
with
the
outside
world
was
dressed
like
an
american
city
in
february
except
that
here
black
was
more
general
and
choking
high
collars
and
foppish
canes
far
more
in
evidence
wherefore
seeing
two
men
of
foreign
aspect
visibly
shivering
in
their
strange
uniforms
descending
upon
them
the
pulsating
throng
could
be
dispersed
only
with
difficulty
and
excited
urchins
raced
beside
the
horse
car
that
set
us
down
at
last
before
a
recommended
hotel
hays
who
was
nothing
if
not
as
well
as
tropical
blooded
lost
no
time
in
putting
on
every
wool
garment
his
baggage
contained
and
dived
under
four
blankets
vowing
never
to
be
seen
again
in
public
we
seemed
to
have
reached
the
very
center
of
this
incongruous
civilization
of
the
isolated
fastnesses
of
the
andes
our
suite
took
up
an
entire
corner
of
the
hotel
there
were
carpets
in
which
our
feet
sank
half
out
of
sight
capacious
upholstered
chairs
divans
in
every
corner
tables
that
might
have
graced
a
french
château
pier
glass
mirrors
gleaming
chandeliers
lamps
with
double
burners
in
addition
to
electric
lights
our
parlor
its
huge
windows
resplendent
with
lace
curtains
opened
on
a
balcony
overhanging
the
street
as
did
also
the
adjoining
bedroom
as
richly
furnished
and
with
two
colonial
bedsteads
heaped
high
with
mattresses
their
many
blankets
covered
with
glossy
vicuña
hides
we
were
far
indeed
from
the
frontiersman
steamers
of
the
magdalena
when
the
hunger
of
the
highlands
asserted
itself
we
sneaked
down
to
a
luxurious
to
find
the
menu
and
service
equal
to
that
of
some
travelers
palace
on
the
champs
elysées
the
sumptuous
breakfast
that
a
maid
placed
beside
our
beds
next
morning
was
a
humorous
contrast
to
those
we
had
endured
on
the
yet
all
these
luxuries
borne
to
this
lofty
isolation
by
methods
the
most
primitive
known
to
modern
days
were
ours
at
the
paltry
rate
of
a
day
truly
the
cost
of
high
living
had
not
yet
reached
the
altitude
of
bogotá
it
was
evident
however
that
if
we
were
to
live
here
as
anything
but
public
curiosities
we
must
patronize
a
clothing
store
the
zone
costume
so
splendidly
adapted
to
our
future
plans
was
unfortunately
original
for
and
nowhere
does
originality
of
garb
cause
greater
furore
than
in
the
capital
of
colombia
when
we
summoned
up
courage
to
venture
forth
hays
dodged
into
the
first
tailor
shop
that
crossed
his
path
and
instantly
agreed
to
take
whatever
happened
to
be
offered
him
at
any
price
the
tailor
chose
to
returned
to
remain
in
hiding
for
the
ensuing
hours
until
the
articles
were
altered
meanwhile
i
sallied
forth
from
a
establishment
inconspicuous
in
a
native
shirt
that
came
perilously
near
being
born
a
pajama
and
a
heavy
temporarily
black
suit
of
cashmere
with
a
misgiving
tightness
across
the
trousers
on
second
thought
it
was
not
surprising
that
this
far
away
city
of
the
andes
should
be
so
exacting
in
dress
virtually
cut
off
from
the
world
it
was
supremely
eager
to
appear
cosmopolitan
the
result
is
a
tailor
s
paradise
no
one
who
aspires
to
be
ranked
among
the
ever
dreams
of
permitting
himself
to
be
seen
in
public
lacking
any
detail
of
the
equipment
from
derby
to
patent
leathers
that
makes
up
the
mental
picture
of
a
parisian
boulevardier
at
first
we
took
this
multitude
of
faultlessly
dressed
men
to
mean
that
the
city
rolled
in
wealth
as
time
went
on
many
a
dandy
of
fashion
we
had
fancied
a
bank
president
or
the
son
of
some
prince
of
finance
turned
out
to
be
a
barber
or
the
keeper
of
a
if
not
indeed
without
even
so
legitimate
a
source
of
income
it
is
due
no
doubt
to
some
misinterpretation
of
the
european
fashion
sheets
that
the
main
street
corners
were
habitually
blocked
long
before
noon
by
men
and
youths
in
prince
alberts
who
spent
the
greater
part
of
the
day
leaning
with
parisian
nonchalance
on
canes
the
women
of
the
better
class
on
the
other
hand
are
never
seen
disguised
as
parisians
except
on
rare
gala
occasions
at
morning
mass
or
in
their
circumspect
tours
of
shopping
they
appear
swathed
from
head
to
foot
in
the
black
a
thing
of
thin
texture
wound
about
head
and
body
to
the
hips
and
leaving
only
a
bit
of
the
face
and
a
bare
glimpse
of
their
hair
visible
to
us
the
costume
was
pleasing
in
its
simplicity
bogotanos
however
complain
that
it
is
and
in
time
we
too
came
to
have
that
impression
as
if
the
sex
had
gone
perpetually
into
mourning
for
the
ways
of
its
male
relatives
the
great
underlying
mass
of
the
population
has
no
requirements
in
the
matter
of
dress
in
general
the
del
men
of
the
people
shoddy
trousers
of
indeterminate
hue
soles
held
in
place
by
strips
of
socks
a
soiled
panama
always
very
much
out
of
place
in
this
climate
and
covering
all
else
a
or
blanket
with
a
hole
in
the
center
through
which
to
thrust
the
head
their
women
rarely
wear
black
but
simple
gowns
of
some
light
color
at
least
on
sundays
after
which
its
whiteness
decreases
they
go
commonly
bareheaded
often
barefooted
and
always
stockingless
every
scene
from
street
to
cathedral
shrine
is
enlivened
by
the
bare
legs
of
women
and
girls
often
decidedly
attractive
in
those
who
have
no
great
prejudice
for
the
bath
to
be
nearer
the
center
of
activities
we
had
taken
a
room
in
the
third
story
of
the
municipal
building
on
the
site
of
the
palace
of
the
viceroys
down
below
lay
the
main
plaza
of
colombia
tenerani
s
celebrated
statue
of
bolívar
in
its
center
the
still
unfinished
capitol
building
cutting
it
off
on
the
right
across
the
square
we
could
look
in
at
the
door
of
the
ancient
shake
our
fists
at
its
constantly
clanging
bells
beyond
much
of
the
city
spread
out
before
us
the
thatched
huts
of
misery
spilling
a
little
way
up
the
foot
of
the
dismal
black
range
that
filled
in
the
rest
of
the
picture
the
altitude
of
stands
feet
above
the
level
of
the
fails
to
impress
itself
upon
the
newcomer
many
travelers
do
not
risk
the
sudden
ascent
from
jirardot
to
the
capital
in
a
single
day
but
stop
over
between
trains
at
a
halfway
town
during
the
first
days
i
was
content
to
march
slowly
a
few
blocks
up
and
down
her
slightly
inclined
streets
and
even
then
found
myself
with
the
faint
third
cousin
of
a
headache
several
mild
attacks
of
nose
bleed
and
a
soreness
of
all
the
body
as
if
from
undue
pressure
of
the
blood
until
the
first
effects
wear
away
energy
is
at
its
lowest
ebb
and
time
passes
on
leaden
wings
the
change
in
mood
is
as
marked
as
in
the
character
of
the
permanent
inhabitants
from
the
moment
of
his
arrival
the
traveler
feels
again
that
foresighted
attitude
toward
life
common
to
the
temperate
zone
all
the
light
airy
gay
and
wasteful
ways
of
panama
and
the
tropics
fade
away
like
the
memory
of
some
former
existence
and
it
is
easy
to
understand
why
the
bogotano
is
quite
different
in
temperament
from
the
languid
inhabitants
along
the
magdalena
unlike
many
regions
of
high
altitude
however
bogotá
is
not
a
nervous
city
there
are
lower
places
in
mexico
for
instance
where
the
nerves
seem
always
at
a
tension
here
we
felt
serene
and
unexcited
all
day
long
as
in
the
first
hours
of
waking
from
long
refreshing
sleep
except
in
the
actual
sunshine
the
air
was
raw
even
at
noon
the
wind
from
off
the
backing
range
or
across
the
sabana
cut
through
our
garments
as
if
they
were
of
cheesecloth
the
thermometer
falls
much
lower
in
other
climes
but
here
artificial
heat
is
unknown
and
a
more
penetrating
cold
is
inconceivable
by
night
the
bogotano
wears
an
overcoat
of
the
greatest
obtainable
thickness
he
dines
and
goes
to
the
theater
in
a
temperature
that
would
make
outdoor
new
york
in
early
november
seem
cozy
and
hospitable
well
dressed
men
in
gloves
and
overcoats
and
women
in
furs
walking
briskly
across
the
square
below
our
window
on
their
way
from
the
electric
street
cars
to
the
theater
or
the
circo
keller
gave
the
scene
quite
the
appearance
of
a
similar
one
in
an
american
town
in
the
first
days
of
winter
yet
this
was
july
and
we
were
barely
five
degrees
from
the
equator
beside
us
lay
the
latest
newspapers
from
new
york
half
way
to
the
north
pole
bristling
with
such
items
as
rooms
for
the
summer
four
dead
of
heat
it
is
a
peculiar
climate
some
arctic
perennially
and
the
poorer
people
inured
to
it
from
birth
seem
to
thrive
in
bare
legs
and
summer
garb
frost
is
virtually
unknown
not
because
the
temperature
does
not
warrant
it
but
because
what
would
be
frost
elsewhere
evaporates
in
the
thin
air
once
the
sun
has
set
nothing
seems
quite
so
attractive
whatever
the
plans
made
by
day
as
to
read
for
an
hour
huddled
in
all
spare
clothing
then
to
throw
open
the
windows
and
dive
under
as
many
blankets
as
a
minnesota
farmer
in
january
the
bogotano
does
not
of
course
believe
in
open
windows
though
he
scorns
a
has
never
thought
to
build
has
a
quaking
fear
of
the
night
air
against
which
he
charges
a
score
of
diseases
headed
by
the
dreaded
pneumonia
of
high
altitudes
those
who
venture
out
at
night
habitually
hold
a
handkerchief
over
mouth
and
nostrils
yet
at
least
this
can
be
said
that
nowhere
is
sleep
if
properly
tucked
in
more
sound
and
refreshing
within
a
week
we
found
ourselves
should
i
say
took
to
exploring
the
city
more
thoroughly
the
air
was
still
noticeably
thin
but
there
was
enough
of
it
to
furnish
the
even
for
the
five
mile
stroll
up
to
the
natural
stone
gateway
where
the
highway
to
the
east
clambers
away
through
a
notch
and
begins
the
descent
to
venezuela
looking
down
upon
it
from
here
the
misinformed
traveler
might
easily
fancy
the
broad
sabana
the
plains
of
some
northern
clime
never
guessing
that
forty
miles
to
the
west
the
world
falls
abruptly
away
into
the
torrid
zone
for
bogotá
is
chiefly
remarkable
for
its
location
taken
somewhere
else
it
would
be
like
many
another
city
of
spanish
ancestry
its
streets
are
singularly
alike
wide
straight
a
few
paved
in
macadam
more
in
rough
cobbles
many
and
all
with
a
central
line
of
flagstones
worn
smooth
by
the
feet
of
generations
of
carriers
the
chiefly
houses
toe
sidewalks
so
narrow
that
two
can
seldom
pass
abreast
and
for
those
who
know
spain
or
her
former
colonies
there
is
nothing
unusual
in
the
architecture
the
streets
cross
each
other
at
solemn
right
angles
and
those
which
do
not
fade
away
on
the
plain
fetch
sharply
up
against
the
rusty
black
range
that
backs
the
city
the
system
of
street
numbering
is
excellent
that
of
the
houses
clumsy
and
the
former
is
marred
by
the
habit
of
the
volatile
government
in
changing
familiar
names
as
often
as
some
new
or
forgotten
patriot
is
called
to
its
attention
thus
the
plaza
san
augustín
had
been
the
plaza
ayacucho
up
to
a
short
time
before
our
arrival
yet
before
we
left
it
had
become
the
plaza
sucre
in
honor
of
a
new
statue
of
that
general
unveiled
on
colombia
s
independence
day
july
twentieth
in
like
manner
the
plaza
de
egipto
was
transformed
before
our
very
eyes
into
the
plaza
de
maza
this
weakness
for
honoring
new
heroes
is
characteristic
of
the
whole
country
not
only
are
its
provinces
frequently
renamed
but
in
the
short
century
since
its
independence
the
nation
itself
has
basked
under
a
half
dozen
titles
wit
la
gran
colombia
nueva
granada
confederación
granadina
estados
unidos
de
nueva
granada
estados
unidos
de
colombia
and
since
república
de
colombia
there
are
evidences
that
it
is
not
yet
entirely
satisfied
it
is
less
in
its
material
aspects
than
in
the
ways
of
its
population
that
the
traveler
finds
bogotá
interesting
about
every
inhabitant
hovers
a
glamour
of
romance
either
he
has
always
lived
in
this
miniature
world
or
he
has
at
least
once
made
the
laborious
journey
up
to
it
the
vast
majority
are
born
live
and
die
here
in
their
lofty
isolation
shut
away
by
weeks
of
wilderness
from
the
outside
world
alone
with
its
own
little
trials
and
triumphs
it
seems
something
long
ago
left
behind
up
here
under
the
chilly
stars
by
a
receding
wave
of
civilization
small
wonder
its
people
consider
their
city
the
center
of
the
universe
those
who
travel
a
little
way
out
into
the
world
see
nothing
to
compare
with
it
the
scant
minority
that
reach
paris
are
credited
with
fervid
imaginations
if
indeed
the
picture
of
what
they
have
seen
is
not
effaced
during
the
long
toilsome
journey
back
to
their
own
beloved
capital
perhaps
no
other
city
of
is
more
nearly
what
a
newly
discovered
one
must
have
been
to
the
happy
explorers
of
earlier
times
now
and
then
there
comes
upon
the
traveler
the
regret
that
it
is
not
entirely
cut
off
instead
of
so
a
region
fitted
for
the
development
of
its
own
customs
had
it
been
left
to
its
aboriginal
chibchas
it
might
have
evolved
a
civilization
entirely
its
own
altogether
different
and
not
this
rather
crumpled
copy
of
familiar
world
capitals
bogotá
is
decidedly
a
white
man
s
city
indeed
there
is
hardly
another
of
its
size
south
of
the
canadian
border
in
which
the
percentage
of
pure
white
complexions
is
higher
on
rare
occasions
a
negro
who
had
drifted
up
from
the
hot
lands
below
sat
huddled
in
the
main
plaza
in
all
the
blankets
and
ruanas
he
could
borrow
but
his
face
was
sure
soon
to
be
numbered
among
the
missing
brunettes
predominate
of
course
but
blonds
are
by
no
means
rare
the
bootblack
who
served
us
now
and
then
was
a
decided
towhead
red
cheeks
are
almost
the
rule
slight
atmospheric
pressure
bringing
the
blood
nearer
the
surface
no
doubt
largely
accounts
for
this
but
there
are
many
other
evidences
of
general
good
health
at
this
altitude
the
violation
of
most
of
the
rules
of
sanitation
are
lightly
punished
the
temperature
cold
enough
to
be
invigorating
yet
not
so
cold
as
to
require
our
artificial
heat
combined
with
its
simple
placid
life
makes
bogotá
a
town
of
plump
robust
figures
particularly
among
the
women
unmarked
by
the
dissipation
common
to
the
males
many
of
the
former
may
frankly
be
termed
beautiful
in
spite
of
a
tendency
of
the
sex
to
wear
distinctly
noticeable
black
mustaches
unfortunately
the
men
of
the
class
are
not
believers
in
exercise
or
the
systematic
caring
for
the
body
scorning
every
unnecessary
physical
exertion
letting
themselves
grow
up
haphazard
they
are
noticeably
and
an
american
long
resident
in
the
city
seriously
advised
us
to
get
a
hump
into
your
shoulders
so
you
won
t
attract
so
much
even
the
descendants
of
the
chibchas
that
make
up
much
of
the
population
of
the
outskirts
and
the
surrounding
country
have
a
tinge
of
russet
in
their
cheeks
and
are
by
no
means
so
dark
as
our
aborigines
daily
they
swarm
into
the
city
that
was
once
theirs
short
yet
sturdy
muscular
carriers
and
arrieros
as
often
female
as
male
pass
noiselessly
through
the
streets
with
the
produce
of
their
country
patches
girls
barely
ten
to
old
women
many
of
comely
features
in
spite
of
the
encrusted
dirt
of
years
more
often
so
brutalized
by
toil
as
to
seem
hardly
human
dressed
in
matted
rags
their
feet
and
legs
bare
almost
to
the
knees
plod
past
under
burdens
an
american
workman
could
not
carry
a
hundred
yards
early
in
the
wintry
plateau
mornings
they
set
out
from
their
cobblestone
or
mud
hovels
thatched
with
the
tough
grass
of
the
uplands
that
are
huddled
in
the
mountain
passes
or
strewn
out
along
the
sabana
driving
a
a
steer
since
the
former
animal
loses
much
of
his
belligerency
at
this
its
back
a
load
little
larger
than
that
which
the
female
driver
with
a
strap
about
her
brow
carries
herself
they
are
all
but
indistinguishable
from
the
men
who
tramp
beside
them
a
patchwork
skirt
instead
of
tattered
trousers
is
almost
the
only
difference
in
dress
and
their
manner
is
utterly
devoid
of
any
feminine
touch
brawny
as
the
men
they
march
through
all
the
hardships
of
life
as
sturdily
and
uncomplainingly
as
our
early
pioneers
asking
sympathy
neither
by
word
nor
look
it
is
a
commonplace
sight
in
bogotá
to
see
a
mere
girl
in
years
grasp
the
rope
of
a
bull
and
throw
him
to
his
knees
or
lay
hold
of
a
in
her
calloused
hands
and
with
one
foot
against
the
animal
s
ribs
tighten
the
girth
with
the
skill
of
an
experienced
arriero
girls
and
boys
alike
are
trained
from
their
earliest
years
to
this
life
of
bovine
toil
never
looking
forward
to
any
other
of
the
existence
of
schools
they
have
hardly
an
inkling
to
them
life
is
bounded
by
their
cheerless
hovels
and
the
of
the
city
numerous
as
the
of
mexico
in
every
corner
of
the
capital
these
low
drinking
shops
abound
masquerading
under
such
misnomers
as
el
nido
de
amor
the
love
nest
overrun
by
their
besotted
votaries
of
both
sexes
yet
the
bogotano
indian
drunk
is
quiet
and
peaceful
compared
with
the
mexican
for
seems
chiefly
to
bring
drowsiness
and
contentment
with
life
as
it
is
illustration
bogotá
and
its
from
the
summit
of
guadalupe
illustration
the
central
plaza
of
bogotá
from
the
window
of
our
room
in
the
center
is
the
famous
statue
of
bolívar
by
tenarani
on
the
right
the
new
in
the
middle
foreground
the
cathedral
backed
by
the
peaks
of
guadalupe
and
monserrate
ever
since
our
arrival
hays
and
i
had
been
threatening
to
patronize
one
of
the
two
public
bath
houses
with
a
bogotano
reputation
rumor
had
it
existed
in
the
capital
but
in
a
land
where
the
temperature
rarely
reaches
fifty
and
the
floors
are
tiled
it
takes
courage
and
we
had
been
satisfying
ourselves
and
our
duty
to
humanity
by
bravely
splashing
a
basin
of
icy
water
over
our
manly
forms
each
morning
on
arising
by
dint
of
strong
resolutions
often
repeated
to
be
up
at
six
and
visit
one
of
the
de
we
did
finally
manage
one
morning
to
find
ourselves
wandering
the
streets
by
eight
with
towel
and
soap
under
our
arms
and
stared
at
by
all
we
met
we
discovered
la
violeta
at
last
next
door
to
a
blacksmith
shop
the
keeper
we
woke
up
told
us
we
might
have
a
cold
bath
but
that
the
sign
on
the
front
wall
hot
baths
at
all
hours
was
to
be
taken
with
a
bogotano
meaning
a
few
mornings
later
we
did
actually
find
the
other
establishment
open
we
entered
a
large
patio
the
most
striking
of
several
buildings
within
which
was
a
round
or
more
exactly
an
house
and
in
time
succeeded
in
arousing
the
place
to
the
extent
of
bringing
down
upon
us
a
youth
hugely
excited
at
the
appearance
of
a
crowd
of
two
whole
bathers
all
at
one
time
it
turned
out
that
each
of
the
eight
sides
of
the
strange
building
bathroom
of
the
shape
of
a
slice
of
cake
with
a
frigid
tile
floor
and
an
aged
porcelain
tub
in
which
a
bath
cost
only
at
the
back
was
a
larger
though
none
the
less
dreary
chamber
with
a
or
the
youth
assured
us
there
was
plenty
of
hot
water
i
won
the
toss
and
was
soon
stripped
but
the
shower
was
colder
than
the
bounding
the
pole
when
i
had
caught
my
breath
i
bawled
my
repertory
of
profane
spanish
at
the
youth
who
could
be
seen
through
a
hole
above
pottering
with
some
sort
of
upright
boiler
and
firebox
and
now
and
then
peering
down
upon
me
suddenly
the
water
grew
warm
hot
boiling
then
just
when
i
had
soaped
myself
from
crown
to
toe
in
the
steam
it
turned
as
suddenly
cold
again
and
an
instant
later
stopped
entirely
my
eyes
tight
closed
i
shouted
at
the
youth
above
es
que
el
agua
caliente
se
acabó
he
droned
it
is
that
the
hot
water
has
finished
there
being
no
deadly
weapon
at
hand
i
turned
on
a
tap
of
water
and
raced
to
the
still
half
soaped
hays
scantily
clad
was
gazing
fiercely
at
the
youth
through
a
hole
in
the
door
then
there
isn
t
any
more
hot
water
he
demanded
not
now
señor
but
there
will
be
good
how
soon
early
morning
but
i
want
to
bathe
now
ah
you
want
to
bathe
repeated
the
youth
with
eyes
no
you
son
of
spigdom
exploded
the
ordinarily
i
came
here
and
stripped
to
an
undershirt
that
i
might
dance
in
my
bare
feet
on
this
tile
floor
in
honor
of
josé
maría
de
la
santa
trinidad
simón
bolívar
get
up
on
that
roof
and
fire
up
or
the
youth
was
already
feverishly
stoking
armsful
of
wood
under
the
upright
boiler
and
by
the
time
i
left
for
home
hays
was
shadow
boxing
to
keep
warm
with
a
fair
chance
of
getting
a
bath
before
the
day
was
done
as
is
to
be
expected
from
its
isolation
the
colombian
capital
is
a
deeply
religious
not
to
say
a
fanatical
city
an
infernal
din
of
church
bells
of
the
tone
of
suspended
pans
or
broken
boilers
makes
the
early
morning
hours
hideous
and
continues
at
frequent
intervals
throughout
the
day
here
contrary
to
the
custom
in
most
centers
of
the
latin
race
the
men
as
well
as
the
women
go
to
church
college
professors
and
literary
lights
of
no
mean
ability
seriously
contend
that
the
shinbone
of
some
saint
in
this
shrine
or
that
temple
has
miraculous
power
but
the
superstition
of
isolation
hangs
particularly
heavy
over
the
uneducated
masses
of
late
years
the
liberals
and
the
masons
have
grown
nearly
as
powerful
as
the
conservatives
and
do
not
hesitate
to
express
themselves
freely
in
public
knowing
that
in
case
of
attack
any
representative
body
of
the
population
includes
who
will
come
to
their
rescue
every
public
gathering
is
pregnant
with
possibilities
of
an
outburst
between
the
two
divisions
of
society
the
very
talk
inextricably
entangled
with
the
foreigner
who
wishes
to
hold
the
attention
of
a
colombian
for
a
conversation
of
any
length
must
have
some
knowledge
or
at
least
a
plausible
pretense
of
knowledge
of
interior
political
questions
it
was
a
bare
three
years
since
a
protestant
missionary
had
been
stoned
by
the
populace
of
bogotá
though
he
now
held
his
services
in
peace
in
what
despite
the
lack
of
outward
signs
was
really
a
church
policemen
armed
with
rifles
liberally
besprinkle
every
meeting
in
theater
cathedral
or
public
square
shortly
before
our
arrival
a
dozen
officers
and
citizens
had
been
killed
in
a
religious
riot
in
the
bullring
were
they
less
these
policemen
of
bogotá
might
easily
be
taken
for
irishmen
and
an
american
fancy
himself
back
in
the
new
york
of
a
decade
ago
the
uniform
of
the
day
force
is
a
copy
of
that
of
our
own
metropolis
before
the
helmets
were
abolished
at
night
the
scene
changes
in
every
street
spring
up
officers
in
high
caps
and
long
capes
who
might
have
stepped
directly
from
the
arrondissements
of
paris
with
even
the
short
sword
in
place
of
the
daytime
they
are
a
well
disciplined
body
of
men
quite
unlike
the
childish
inefficient
guardians
of
law
and
disorder
so
familiar
from
the
rio
grande
southward
the
bogotano
officer
would
no
sooner
be
seen
sitting
lounging
or
smoking
on
duty
than
would
one
in
our
own
large
cities
as
in
all
countries
however
the
chief
drawback
to
a
really
efficient
service
is
the
caste
system
the
policemen
are
of
necessity
recruited
from
the
gente
del
pueblo
and
though
they
have
no
hesitancy
in
arresting
one
of
their
own
class
the
sight
of
a
white
collar
paralyzes
them
with
their
ingrown
deference
to
the
more
powerful
rank
of
society
the
result
is
that
a
person
can
commit
anything
short
of
serious
crime
under
the
very
eyes
of
the
police
the
officer
may
keep
the
culprit
under
surveillance
but
rarely
summons
up
courage
actually
to
arrest
him
until
he
has
definite
orders
from
a
superior
there
are
curious
local
customs
in
bogotá
her
small
shops
for
example
have
a
system
of
signs
intelligible
only
to
the
initiated
a
red
flag
announces
meat

sale
a
red
flag

a
yellow
star

end
of
a

the
entrance
to
a
cheap
restaurant
a
tuft
of
faded
flowers
a
chichería
the
bogotano
sees
nothing
incongruous
in
a
building
that
announces
itself
a
primary
school
above
and
an
american
bar
below
on
week
days
the
pedestrian
slinks
through
many
of
the
chief
residential
streets
apparently
unseen
on
a
gala
sunday
afternoon
the
same
stroll
is
to
run
an
unbroken
gauntlet
of
feminine
eyes
for
then
the
señoritas
who
are
seen
if
at
all
during
the
week
hurrying
to
mass
all
but
concealed
in
their
mantos
don
their
most
resplendent
garb
and
with
cushions
under
their
plump
elbows
lean
in
their
window
embrasures
oggling
and
being
oggled
through
the
iron
a
native
of
medellín
where
envy
of
the
capital
and
her
politicians
is
rife
had
assured
us
as
far
away
as
panama
all
they
do
in
bogotá
is
study
and
we
had
only
to
glance
out
our
windows
to
find
basis
for
the
first
part
of
the
assertion
the
plaza
below
was
always
alive
with
students
from
the
local
institutions
of
higher
learning
for
males
marching
slowly
back
and
forth
conning
the
day
s
lessons
the
fireless
houses
are
cold
and
particularly
in
the
morning
and
the
city
long
ago
formed
the
habit
of
studying
afoot
the
racial
dislike
of
solitude
and
the
eagerness
to
be
seen
and
recognized
by
their
fellows
as
devotees
of
learning
may
also
have
some
part
in
a
practice
that
many
a
bogotano
continues
through
life
it
is
commonplace
to
pass
in
almost
any
street
men
even
past
middle
age
strolling
along
with
an
open
book
in
one
hand
and
the
inevitable
cane
in
the
other

colonial
times
bogotá
won
the
reputation
if
not
the
actual
position
of
literary
capital
of
south
her
speech
is
still
the
best
castilian
of
america
with
little
of
that
slovenliness
of
pronunciation
so
general
from
the
rio
grande
southward
to
this
day
the
city
has
a
considerable
intellectual
life
wider
perhaps
than
it
is
deep
everyone
writes
he
is
a
rare
public
man
who
has
not
published
at
least
a
handful
of
versos
in
his
youth
poets
writers
painters
and
musical
composers
are
more
numerous
than
in
many
a
far
larger
center
of
civilization
the
placid
isolation
of
life
in
bogotá
almost
completely
severed
from
the
feverish
distractions
of
the
modern
world
makes
this
natural
there
is
nothing
else
to
do
then
too
lack
of
opportunity
to
compare
their
work
with
that
of
a
wider
world
no
doubt
gives
the
literatos
of
bogotá
a
that
might
otherwise
be
slighter
the
cheap
local
pour
out
a
constant
flood
of
volumes
of
the
local
poets

same
cachacos

filipichines

coats

lean
with
such
parisian
grace

their
canes

the
principal

youth

his
smudged
likeness

no

could
have
been
more
universally
white
of
complexion
indeed
the
gathering
was
strikingly
like
a
similar
one
in
our
own
a
march
evening
when
the
furnace
had
broken
down
or
the
janitor
gone
on
strike

wore
overcoats
and
kept
constantly
bundled
up

solemn
whispering
of
the
audience

it
gathered

unattractiveness
of

women

of
whom
had

left

staid
mien
of

men
in
their
frock
coats
gave
the
scene
the
atmosphere
of
a
meeting
of
highbrows
in
a
corner
of
new
england
but
there
was
superimposed
a
pompous
solemnity
and
a
funereal
tone
peculiar
to
the
to
a
race
that
lays
more
stress
on
the
correctness
of
its
manner
than
the
weight
of
its
matter

misstatement
or
a
palpably
erroneous
fact
or
conclusion

felt
might
pass
muster
but
not
a
slip
in
the
urbanities
of
society
or
the
incorrect
knotting
of
a
cravat
it
was
a
lecture
in
the
french
sense
when
the
president
had
taken
his
place
and
all
was
arranged
in
faultless
parisian
order
the
speaker
removed
his
and
began
solemnly
to
read
from
typewritten
manuscript
he
was
a
man
of
forty
wearing
glasses
with
the
perpendicular
wrinkles
of
close
study
on
his
brow
a
score
of
countries
could
have
reproduced
him
ad
libitum
he
read
drearily
monotonously
with
constant
care
never
to
spill
over
into
the
merely
human
the
discourse
based
itself
on
the
narrow
national
patriotism
common
to
yet
at
times
the
speaker
talked
plainly
admitting
that
colombia
is
illiterate
and
that
half
the
remainder
can
barely
read
and
write
the
church
he
assailed
bitterly
for
its
shortcomings
yet
never
mentioned
it
directly
in
time
as
is
bound
to
happen
sooner
or
later
in
any
public
meeting
in
colombia
he
drifted
into
the
great
national
grievance
and
whined
through
several
pages
on
the
wickedness
of
taking
the
rebel
province
of
panama
away
from
us
a
weak
and
helpless
people
i
caught
several
of
the
audience
gazing
fixedly
at
me
as
if
they
fancied
i
had
taken
some
active
part
in
that
debateable
action
through
all
the
latter
part
of
the
lecture
the
church
bells
across
the
way
kept
up
a
constant
jangling
that
completely
swallowed
up
whatever
conclusions
he
had
gained
from
his
laborious
dissertation
it
was
strangely
as
if
the
voice
of
religion
and
superstition
were
trying
by
din
and
hubbub
to
drown
out
that
of
reason
and
reflection
as
it
has
since
the
first
danced
howling
into
the
circle
of
elders
in
conference
in
the
stone
age
on
the
panama
question
the
attitude
of
the
colombian
man
in
the
street
is
not
exactly
that
of
the
government
a
native
holding
a
small
post
though
clinging
to
the
same
convictions
on
the
taking
of
the
rebel
province
as
the
bulk
of
his
countrymen
expressed
himself
to
me
as
follows
we
ordinary
citizens
feel
that
our
country
should
be
paid
for
the
loss
of
panama
and
the
slight
to
our
national
honor
but
we
hope
very
much
that
your
united
states
will
not
pay
our
government
a
large
sum
of
money
in
cash
as
contemplated
by
the
proposed
treaty
for
almost
all
of
it
would
go
into
the
pockets
of
the
dozen
politicians
who
hold
the
reins
of
government
give
us
works
railway
from
the
coast
to
bogotá
or
a
perfected
harbor
with
docks
and
modern
one
day
soon
after
our
arrival
we
strolled
over
to
the
to
begin
the
colombian
reading
we
had
planned
it
was
wasted
effort
we
brought
up
against
a
heavy
colonial
door
bearing
the
announcement
suspended
until
further
notice
by
order
of
the
ministry
of
public
an
american
resident
interpreted
it
to
mean
oh
some
of
the
readers
have
been
stealing
books
again
we
recalled
the
cynical
native
of
medellín
days
later
however
when
we
gained
unofficial
admission
for
a
few
moments
we
found
that
the
volumes
bequeathed
by
a
colombian
literato
not
unknown
to
a
wider
pombo
who
had
recently
died
in
being
catalogued
several
pedants
were
smoking
innumerable
cigarettes
and
deceiving
themselves
into
the
notion
that
they
were
at
work
arranging
the
books
but
the
national
library
remained
hermetically
sealed
to
the
public
as
long
as
we
remained
in
the
capital
it
was
by
no
means
the
first
nor
the
last
time
we
met
a
similar
disappointment
in
south
america
we
had
put
it
off
a
long
while
before
we
gathered
courage
and
all
our
woolen
garments
and
hurried
through
the
wintry
night
to
bogotá
s
main
theater
as
in
other
restricted
societies
entertainments
are
frequently
got
up
here
chiefly
with
local
talent
it
is
a
long
way
to
any
other
talent
in
bogotá
this
one
was
a
in
honor
of
that
same
rafael
pombo
fortunately
the
audience
was
large
enough
to
keep
the
place
moderately
warm
every
detail
every
movement
the
very
of
the
distinctly
good
looking
if
mustached
ladies
in
boxes
and
stalls
were
as
exact
a
copy
as
was
humanly
possible
of
similar
scenes
at
the
opera
in
paris
a
copy
in
miniature
bearing
the
earmarks
of
having
been
taken
from
some
novel
of
the
boulevards
señora
la
bogotana
used
her
lorgnette
exactly
as
she
had
read
of
her
parisian
counterpart
doing
the
men
in
faultless
evening
dress
down
to
the
last
white
eyeglass
ribbon
about
the
neck
strove
to
act
precisely
as
they
conceived
men
did
on
like
occasions
in
the
wider
world
again
all
was
burdened
by
the
solemn
artificiality
of
the
race
one
after
another
six
men
burst
genteelly
upon
the
stage
and
declaimed
something
or
other
in
that
painful
flamboyant
ranting
so
beloved
of
the
latin
all
the
cut
and
dried
forms
of
cultured
society
were
solemnly
carried
out
flowers
some
one
had
read
were
always
presented
to
the
performers
and
even
the
podgy
pompous
old
fellow
who
forgot
his
piece
several
times
had
solemnly
thrust
upon
him
by
a
stage
lackey
in
gorgeous
livery
two
immense
wreaths
of
blossoms
in
one
matter
at
least
these
bogotanos
were
at
an
advantage
over
amateurs
of
other
lands
natural
declaimers
and
reciters
from
babyhood
their
tongues
always
eager
for
utterance
almost
devoid
of
that
bashfulness
that
works
the
undoing
of
the
less
fluent
but
perhaps
deeper
thinking
races
they
seemed
seasoned
actors
in
those
points
which
called
for
strictly
histrionic
ability
in
another
theater
a
few
nights
later
we
saw
several
spanish
comedies
presented
by
a
company
of
local
amateurs
and
were
astonished
at
the
excellence
of
the
work
that
of
a
few
of
the
principals
would
have
won
praise
on
any
stage
three

bogotá
though
none
of
them
gets
very
far

remarkable
only
for
the
bulking
hill
beside
it
almost
solid
rock

the
mouths
of
a
score
of
small

in
plain
sight
somewhat
up

fine
dissolved
in

evaporated
pressed
and
packed
into
bags
that
are
carried
away
by
women
and

with
a
band
across
their
foreheads
but
the
excursion
par
excellence
is
that
to
the
falls
of
tequendama
the
theme
of
at
least
one
poem
by
every
bogotano
writer
the
unholy
clatter
of
helped
me
arouse
hays
one
morning
in
time
to
catch
the
early
train
on
the
ferrocarril
del
some
twenty
miles
out
we
descended
at
the
isolated
little
station
of
tequendama
and
struck
off
through
a
region
wholly
unwooded
and
almost
desert
dry
as
the
road
mounted
a
bit
from
the
bare
sabana
a
hardy
vegetation
appeared
here
and
there
a
small
grove
of
eucalypti
and
a
bushy
natural
growth
thinly
covering
the
sides
of
the
low
mountains
among
which
we
were
soon
winding
before
long
we
fell
in
with
the
narrow
bogotá
river
idling
placidly
along
little
guessing
what
a
tremendous
tumble
it
was
due
to
get
a
bit
later
tradition
has
it
that
a
god
or
an
inca
desiring
to
drain
the
lake
that
once
covered
the
sabana
opened
the
gap
through
which
the
stream
drops
by
and
by
there
appeared
ahead
a
whirling
mist
cloud
which
grew
until
we
found
ourselves
completely
enveloped
in
a
great
fog
out
of
which
rose
a
dull
roar
of
indistinct
location
directed
by
a
peasant
we
descended
through
a
rustic
gate
and
for
some
yards
down
a
field
of
heather
and
grass
speckled
with
white
clover
blossoms
and
scattered
with
massive
protruding
rocks
the
face
of
the
one
of
these

bogotá
merchant
had
disfigured
in
impertinent
american
fashion
with
an

of
his
superior

had
reached
the

of
yet
so
far
as
seeing
went
we
might
as
well
have
been
in
our
cozy
beds
back
in
the
capital
an
ordinary
brown
stream
some
forty
feet
wide
flowed
down
through
bulging
rocks
pitched
over
in
a
short
fall
on
to
a
stony
ledge
at
our
feet
then
off
into
the
unknown
a
mere
country
brook
in
which
we
could
dip
our
fingers
here
a
foot
beyond
it
was
forever
gone
it
was
as
if
a
whole
world
of
mystery
lay
below
and
about
us
yet
the
curtain
of
swirling
gray
mist
into
which
the
river
plunged
to
be

no
more

note
the

in

we
had
shivered
through
our
lunch
finding
it
difficult
to
believe
that
we
were
five
degrees
from
the
equator
in
the
month
of
july
when
suddenly
the
wind
rose
and
for
a
moment
the
mist
thinned
until
we
caught
a
hint
of
an
immense
chasm
untold
depths
below
then
closed
in
again
the
excursion
seemed
to
have
been
a
failure
we
strolled
on
down
the
highway
in
the
fog
and
loafed
awhile
on
a
bushy
hillside
but
as
we
turned
homeward
the
mist
was
wiped
away
as
suddenly
as
a
curtain
drawn
aside
and
all
tequendama
lay
before
us
i
slid
down
a
steep
bank
to
the
edge
of
the
bottomless
chasm
and
sat
down
where
i
could
remain
as
long
as
i
kept
my
feet
braced
in
the
sod
before
one
of
the
finest
sights
in
the
let
them
slip
and
drop
to
sudden
death
from
the
upper
ledge
the
stream
fell
a
sheer
unbroken
thousand
feet
in
which
the
entire
river
seemed
to
turn
to
spray
and
whatever
was
left
when
it
struck
was
beaten
into
mist
which
rising
like
steam
from
the
yawning
gorge
as
from
some
immense
caldron
hid
all
the
face
of
the
adjacent
country
immeasurably
below
a
much
smaller
stream
could
be
seen
picking
itself
together
again
and
winding
its
way
dizzily
off
through
a
vast
cañon
on
the
perpendicular
walls
of
which
clung
a
few
hardy
plants
and
while
we
remained
in
the
cold
autumn
world
above
the
river
flowed
away
into
the
tropics
into
the
coffee
country
the
land
of
bananas
and
the
perpetual
summer
of
the
magdalena
to
help
float

down
to
the

of
the
many
views
of
bogotá
the
best
is
that
we
had
at
the
end
of
our
stay
from
the
summit
of
guadalupe
a
bit
of
the
backing
range
juts
forth
in
two
peaks
each
with
a
little
white
church
on
its
top
that
seem
almost
sheer
above
the
city
we
climbed
to
the
higher
in
something
more
than
an
hour
massed
clouds
breaking
away
now
and
then
to
flood
with
sunshine
the
ever
widening
sabana
and
the
hazy
mountains
that
seemed
to
cut
off
the
world
completely
and
came
out
at
last
on
a
grassy
platform
where
we
could
look
down
like
the
astonished
conquistadores
on
all
the
vast
plain
and
unlike
them
on
the
city
they
founded
north
and
south
as
far
as
we
could
see
stretched
the
bleak
treeless
range
on
which
we
stood
at
our
feet
this
fell
abruptly
away
to
the
suburban
huts
of
the
city
and
her
encircling
paséo
de
bolívar
every
plaza
and
patio
many
green
with
a
clump
of
eucalypti
every
window
and
was
plainly
visible
the
people
were
so
tiny
we
had
to
look
for
them
carefully
as
for
insects
on
a
carpet
before
we
could
make
them
out
by
hundreds
crawling
along
the
streets
and
specking
the
squares
near
the
cemetery
the
disk
of
the
bullring
filled
now
with
the
tents
of
the
circo
keller
seemed
a
canvas
cover
on
a
small
squat
pail
factories
as
we
understand
the
word
being
unknown
not
a
fleck
of
smoke
smudged
the
expanse
of
the
stoveless
city
its
noises
came
up
to
us
very
faintly
at
times
borne
wholly
away
on
the
wind
and
from
this
height
even
the
diabolic
din
of
sounded
soft
and
almost
musical
a
recent
census
sets
the
population
at
looking
down
upon
the
city
from
guadalupe
this
seems
at
first
an
underestimation
but
gradually
one
realizes
that
not
only
are
its
houses
low
often
of
a
single
story
but
largely
taken
up
by
interior
patios
then
there
are
more
than
a
score
of
churches
innumerable
chapels
eight
large
monasteries
several
seminaries
and
many
residences
of
the
church
authorities
add
to
this
the
many
government
buildings
and
bit
by
bit
the
traveler
grown
skeptical
from
experience
with
figures
begins
to
wonder
if
these
are
not
inflated
there
is
not
a
wooden
building
in
town
treelessness
governs
the
architecture
for
the
surrounding
country
is
above
the
timber
line
though
the
imported
eucalyptus
rises
in
groves
here
and
there
and
flanks
roads
and
railways
a
distinct
line
divides
the
city
from
the
sabana
spread
out
like
a
rich
brown
carpet
cut
up
into
irregular
fields
by
adobe
often
roofed
like
the
houses
with
aged
red
tiles
in
many
places
the
sheen
of
shallow
lakes
recalled
that
the
zipa
of
the
chibchas
built
his
teusaquilla
here
on
the
lower
skirts
of
the
range
to
escape
the
winter
floods
of
the
plain
off
across
it
were
dimly
seen
several
flat
towns
and
here
and
there
a
or
a
cluster
of
them
in
a
grove
of
the
slender
australian
which
merely
accentuated
the
treelessness
of
the
vast
expanse
of
world
six
highways
sally
forth
from
the
city
to
march
waveringly
across
the
plain
mere
threads
lost
at
last
in
the
enclosing
range
broken
gnarled
pitched
and
tumbled
into
every
manner
of
shape
bright
peaks
and
valleys
standing
sharply
forth
where
the
sun
strikes
great
patches
marking
the
shadows
of
the
clouds
beyond
all
else
at
times
lost
in
clouds
at
others
plainly
visible
lay
the
central
range
of
the
cordillera
over
which
we
must
pass
on
our
journey
southward
though
more
than
a
hundred
miles
away
it
bulked
into
the
sky
like
some
vast
supernatural
wall

broad
cone
of

chapter
iii
from
bogotá
over
the
quindio
the
people
of
bogotá
refused
to
take
seriously
our
plan
of
walking
to
quito
it
was
not
merely
that
the
ecuadorian
capital
was
far
away
to
the
inhabitants
of
this
isolated
little
world
it
was
only
a
name
like
moscow
or
lhassa
those
who
had
gone
to
school
as
far
as
the
geography
lessons
had
a
nebulous
notion
that
it
lay
somewhere
to
the
south
and
that
no
sea
intervened
but
their
imaginations
could
not
picture
two
lone
gringos
arriving
by
land
to
seek
information
was
simply
to
waste
time
the
nonexistent
can
not
be
described
the
best
we
could
do
was
to
pore
over
a
page
map
in
a
foreign
atlas
whereon
a
match
according
to
scale
was
miles
long
quito
lay
nearly
three
distant
as
the
crow
flies
without
considering
the
very
mountainous
nature
of
the
country
between
yet
the
hardy
conquistadores
had
somehow
journeyed
thither
and
in
other
parts
of
the
world
we
had
both
traveled
routes
that
the
natives
considered
as
far
away
as
panama
the
horrors
of
this
proposed
tramp
had
been
impressed
upon
me
at
dinner
one
evening
a
typical
stage
englishman
accent
and
all
and
an
incurable
monopolist
of
the
conversation
proved
to
be
the
owner
of
mines
in
colombia
and
i
managed
once
to
cut
in
with
a
query
about
travel
in
that
country
when
the
steamer
lands
you
in
he
began
you
buy
your
mules
ten
or
twelve
hire
your
mozos
and
carriers
and
but
i
plan
to
walk
exploded
my
why
on
earth
should
a
man
wish
to
walk
it
keeps
the
girth
reduced
i
might
have
replied
it
cahn
t
be
done
dogmatized
the
monopolist
absurd
man
cahn
t
travel
on
foot
in
colombia
his
social
standing
depends
on
how
fine
a
mule
he
rides
if
he
walked
he
d
be
taken
for
a
bally
peon
lose
his
caste
entirely
y
know
and
all
that
sort
of
horrible
i
gasped
besides
you
ve
got
to
have
a
to
carry
your
tent
and
bed
and
supplies
and
why
what
on
earth
would
you
eat
huts
i
began
eh
of
the
natives
of
course
but
they
haven
t
a
blessed
thing
to
eat
y
know
they
live
on
corn
cakes
and
beans
and
bananas
and
bread
and
that
sort
of
thing
now
and
then

you

starve
to
death

if
they

a
white
man
coming
they
d
know
he

rob
him

that

of

and
how
are
you
going
to
cross
the
i
tried
to
say
but
the
sentence
was
drowned
in
his
cataract
of
words
and
the
mud
why
bless
me
one
time
a
party
was
going
along
the
road
in
colombia
and
they
saw
a
hat
an
english
hat
lying
in
a
one
of
them
started
to
kick
it
when
a
man
s
voice
shouted
ere
stop
it
that
s
my
bally
ead
what
on
earth
are
you
doing
down
there
said
the
party
sitting
on
my
mule
to
be
sure
said
the
voice
why
bless
me
i
wouldn
t
go
on
foot
in
colombia
for
all
the
gold
in
the
bank
of
england
it
was
the
end
of
july
when
i
tiptoed
out
of
the
american
legation
of
bogotá
bearing
at
last
a
letter
from
our
magnificent
chargé
d
splendid
representative
of
harvard
but
not
thank
god
of
the
united
carried
it
over
to
the
government
building
opposite
the
minister
of
foreign
affairs
to
whom
i
made
my
way
through
a
line
of
typewriters
on
which
officials
were
pounding
out
great
international
matters
with
two
fingers
was
one
of
those
rare
persons
who
know
why
a
man
should
wish
to
walk
though
being
a
colombian
he
had
never
dared
do
so
himself
and
was
moreover
certain
that
quito
could
not
be
reached
by
land
i
was
soon
armed
with
a
gorgeous
if
misspelled
document
in
which
the
government
of
colombia
permitted
itself
to
recommend
los
señores
americanos
therein
named
to
the
authorities
along

america
the
genuine
traveler
sets
out
on
a
journey
by
tossing
a
toothbrush
into
a
pocket
and
strolling
out
of
town
but
even
hays
had
suffered
somewhat
from
that
softening
of
the
vagabond
s
moral
fiber
that
is
the
penalty
for
dallying
with
the
bourgeois
comforts
of
civilization
we
both
had
the
american
hobo
s
disgust
for
the
blanket
stiff
who
packs
his
own
bed
yet
the
andes
offer
no
proper
field
for
orthodox
hoboing
the
journey
of
unknown
duration
and
possibilities
before
us
was
sure
to
have
variations
in
climate
making
extra
clothing
indispensable
moreover
we
could
not
take
the
photographs
along
the
way
unless
we
carried
with
us
means
for
developing
the
negatives
our
first
plan
was
to
buy
a
donkey
and
drive
him
between
us
down
the
crest
of
the
andes
among
the
many
reasons
why
this
fond
dream
could
not
be
realized
was
the
certainty
that
we
should
have
chased
the
animal
off
his
feet
within
a
week
observation
and
reflection
suggested
that
we
should
do
better
to
follow
the
ways
of
the
country
and
hire
a
human
beast
of
burden
for
one
thing
if
the
latter
ran
away
or
dropped
dead
we
lost
nothing
except
perhaps
our
tempers
if
the
donkey
came
to
a
like
end
we
would
be
out
ten
or
twelve
dollars
hays
abandoned
the
plan
with
double
regret
for
with
it
went
the
hope
of
some
day
reporting
the
journey
under
the
arresting
title
three
uncurried
asses
in
the
with
hundreds
of
animated
bundles
of
rags
trotting
about
the
city
ready
to
lug
anything
from
a
load
of
hay
to
a
chest
of
drawers
for
a
mere
piece
we
were
certain
there
would
be
scores
of
native
carriers
eager
to
see
the
world
and
to
substitute
a
dismal
and
intermittent
existence
for
a
steady
job
we
quickly
discovered
however
that
we
were
wrong
in
ascribing
our
own
temperaments
to
the
chibcha
indian
there
was
not
a
youth
among
the
swarming
of
bogotá
who
had
the
faintest
desire
to
see
the
world
the
bare
thought
of
getting
out
of
sound
of
the
clanging
cathedral
bells
filled
them
one
and
all
with
terror
for
the
first
time
we
had
struck
the
basic
economic
fact
that
the
south
american
aboriginal
prefers
to
starve
at
home
rather
than
to
live
in
comparative
opulence
elsewhere
in
prehistoric
times
the
indians
worshipped
the
natural
phenomena
about
their
place
of
birth
each
village
had
its
cave
or
tree
its
stone
or
hill
on
which
it
depended
for
protection
and
the
dread
of
getting
out
of
reach
of
these
still
courses
through
their
primitive
minds
by
dint
of
repeated
packing
and
throwing
away
we
reduced
our
fundamental
necessities
to
little
more
than
the
contents
of
two
swollen
suitcases
word
of
our
nefarious
project
to
contract
a
carrier
to
bear

some
unknown
world
reached
the
last
hovels
of
the
suburbs
but
the
cargadores
we
approached
quickly
named
an
exorbitant
wage
and
fled
at
the
first
opportunity
it
was
not
a
question
of
load
but
of
road
hays
inticed
a
sturdy
fellow
upstairs
one
day
and
pointed
out
our
baggage
on
top
of
an
enormous
chest
the
indian
calmly
picked
up
chest
and
all
murmuring
cheerfully
a
little
heavy
señores
but
i
can
do
it
where
to
when
we
suggested
a
long
trip
however
horror
crept
into
his
eyes
though
his
unemotional
indian
face
showed
none
of
it
and
naming
an
impossible
fee
he
slowly
and
silently
slid
backward
through
the
door
to
our
surprise
a
man
captured
late
on
the
day
before
we
planned
to
start
did
not
show
this
customary
fear
he
proved
to
be
a
native
of
the
eager
to
get
back
to
his
tropical
home
and
asserted
his
ability
to
carry
four
pounds
day
after
day
our
baggage
weighed
far
less
than
that
why
not
take
a
contract
to
go
with
us
by
the
month
i
suggested
cómo
qué
pagarán
los
señores
he
queried
reflectively
we
ll
pay
you
i
answered
setting
the
sum
high
so
that
hays
to
whom
money
was
always
a
minor
detail
could
not
charge
me
with
losing
this
opportunity
a
month
and
food
we
could
see
that
he
fell
for
it
at
once
and
was
merely
procrastinating
in
the
hope
of
getting
more
that
dream
vanished
he
announced
that
he
must
have
a
new
hat
and
for
so
important
a
we
agreed
to
supply
he
turned
up
at
six
in
the
morning
ready
to
start
he
did
not
turn
up
when
we
had
shivered
into
our
clothes
and
gone
to
hang
over
our
cargadores
male
and
female
were
already
plentiful
in
the
wintry
plaza
below
squatted
inside
their
ruanas
or
wandering
aimlessly
about
with
a
rope
over
one
shoulder
out
of
regard
for
the
proprieties
we
beckoned
to
none
but
the
men
it
was
some
time
before
perhaps
had
not
yet
heard
our
at
the
door
we
were
careful
to
mention
only
the
first
town
a
short
day
s
journey
away
and
offered
fifty
cents
at
least
twice
what
he
averaged
in
daily
earnings
convinced
we
would
give
no
more
he
accepted
this
time
we
took
good
care
he
should
not
escape
when
he
had
bound
the
load
with
his
cargador
s
one
indispensable
put
him
outside
and
went
to
breakfast
on
our
return
we
found
him
he
prepared
for
the
journey
not
as
we
of
the
north
would
expect
by
balancing
the
suitcases
on
opposite
sides
but
by
slinging
them
both
on
his
back
the
rope
cutting
deeply
into
his
shoulder
and
set
off
bent
so
low
with
the
weight
chiefly
on
his
hips
that
he
seemed
some
deformed
creature
shuffling
along
behind
us
at
last
we
were
off
marching
out
of
the
main
plaza
of
bogotá
at
eight
on
the
morning
of
august
first
in
our
flannel
shirts
even
with
our
coats
still
on
we
set
all
the
capital
staring
as
we
passed
hays
carried
a
kodak
in
one
pocket
and
ramsey
s
spanish
grammar
in
the
other
my
own
apparatus
and
the
overflow
from
my
suitcase
swung
from
a
shoulder
in
a
or
woven
hemp
bag
even
our
library
consisting
of
a
few
favorite
bits
in
a
languages
bound
into
a
single
book
we
had
been
forced
to
pack
away
on
the
carrier
s
back
we
had
exchanged
instructions
to
cover
any
unexpected
outcome
of
the
journey
those
which
hays
had
handed
me
consisting
chiefly
of
the
command
in
the
event
of
death
with
boots
on
do
not
remove
the
boots
the
morning
paper
that
overtook
us
near
the
statues
of
colombus
and
isabel
announced
that
we
had
left
for
quito
the
day
before
but
failed
to
specify
on
foot
readers
would
have
taken
it
for
a
printer
s
error
anyway
hays
volunteered
to
shadow
the
carrier
for
the
first
day
both
experienced
enough
to
know
that
the
pleasure
of
traveling
together
is
enhanced
by
traveling
apart
we
each
set
our
own
pace
letting
our
moods
take
color
from
the
landscape
drifting
together
now
and
then
when
hungry
for
companionship
or
often
enough
to
assure
ourselves
of
each
other
s
welfare
epictetus
says
as
the
bad
singer
can
not
sing
alone
but
only
in
chorus
so
a
poor
traveler
can
not
travel
alone
but
only
in
hays
having
a
mind
of
his
own
to
feed
on
was
by
virtue
thereof
an
excellent
traveling
companion
at
first
the
way
was
lined
with
houses
of
mud
and
peopled
by
respectful
indians
and
haughty
horsemen
a
bright
sun
frequently
clouded
over
made
it
just
the
day
for
tramping
in
full
garb
the
indian
crawled
along
so
slowly
that
i
soon
forged
ahead
beyond
the
outskirts
the
broad
upland
plain
was
cut
into
irregular
fields
by
adobe
walls
or
fences
often
with
massive
adobe
gate
pillars
fields
dense
with
green
indian
corn
alternated
with
yellow
stretches
of
ripening
grain
here
and
there
potatoes
were
being
planted
masses
of
big
red
roses
of
geraniums
and
daisies
and
unfamiliar
flowers
frequently
beautified
the
scene
two
hours
away
i
caught
the
last
view
of
bogotá
backed
by
her
black
range
then
the
cloistered
city
sank
forever
from
our
sight
as
the
road
dipped
down
from
the
slightest
of
knolls
on
the
all
but
plain
we
had
not
set
out
to
rival
champion
pedestrians
when
appetite
suggested
i
stretched
out
at
the
roadside
with
my
pocket
lunch
reading
swinburne
the
while
and
scattering
him
page
by
page
on
the
gusty
winds
of
the
sabana
hays
and
our
baggage
drifted
languidly
past
all
the
day
we
followed
a
massive
stone
highway
built
by
the
spaniards
of
colonial
times
now
raised
well
above
the
flanking
dirt
roads
preferred
by
the
travel
of
a
large
stone
bridge
of
clumsy
lines
lifted
us
over
the
little
funza
river
which
waters
the
sabana
and
not
far
beyond
we
entered
the
ancient
town
of
mosquiera
on
a
main
corner
of
which
stood
a
statue
of
the
virgin
unusual
only
for
the
fact
that
she
was
of
complexion
as
any
african
chief
to
the
south
american
the
color
line
is
not
sharp
even
in
his
picture
of
the
after
world
some
time
later
having
drifted
together
again
we
met
an
headed
for
bogotá
the
driver
struck
suddenly
at
sight
of
our
strange
garb
and
the
burdened
carrier
behind
us
cried
out
in
consternation
cómo
no
hay
más
función
en
bogotá
we
appreciated
the
implied
compliment
he
had
mistaken
us
for
performers
in
the
keller
circus
a
little
affair
playing
in
the
capital
having
no
doubt
saved
up
his
billetes
for
weeks
and
started
for
town
at
last
with
the
price
of
admission
to
this
wonderful
function
he
was
quite
naturally
dismayed
to
meet
what
seemed
to
be
the
show
trekking
southward
before
he
arrived
at
three
we
strolled
into
serrazuela
officially
named
madrid
hays
pedometer
registered
seventeen
miles
in
the
little
hotel
gaping
with
astonishment
at
our
appearance
we
were
assigned
to
a
room
opening
on
the
patio
and
furnished
with
two
wooden
beds
exactly
five
feet
long
with
very
thin
reed
mattresses
over
the
board
flooring
that
took
the
place
of
springs
in
this
climate
there
was
little
gain
in
traveling
leisurely
and
arriving
early
except
for
a
few
hours
near
noon
it
was
too
cold
to
lounge
along
the
way
once
arrived
we
could
only
wander
aimlessly
about
among
stupid
villagers
uncommunicative
as
their
walls
by
dark
it
had
grown
too
wintry
to
sit
reading
with
comfort
even
had
there
been
any
other
light
than
the
pale
flicker
of
a
small
candle
there
was
nothing
left
but
to
go
to
bed
and
that
had
little
of
the
pleasure
the
phrase
suggests
to
american
ears
when
hays
set
his
feet
against
the
footboard
his
lips
nearly
reached
his
miniature
pillow
he
complained
of
feeling
like
the
victim
of
a
trunk
sometime
in
the
night
i
awoke
to
hear
him
growling
no
wonder
these
people
are
crooked
my
own
was
a
folding
that
i
had
to
fold
up
to
get
into
it
illustration
a
section
of
the
ancient
highway
built
by
the
spaniards
more
than
three
centuries
ago
leading
from
the
of
bogotá
down
into
the
of
the
magdalena
it
was
not
designed
for
wheeled
traffic
hence
is
laid
in
steps
with
a
slope
to
carry
off
the
rains
illustration
at
the
edge
of
the
of
bogotá
though
we
were
afoot
at
chilly
six
at
nine
we
were
still
seeking
a
cargador
the
one
from
bogotá
had
fled
during
the
darkest
hours
moreover
he
had
evidently
spread
startling
reports
of
our
plans
in
a
town
swarming
with
gaunt
and
ragged
we
were
a
long
time
finding
a
man
who
admitted
that
he
sometimes
plied
the
vocation
of
carrier
his
attitude
was
that
of
an
heir
to
unlimited
wealth
whiling
away
the
days
until
he
came
into
his
own
by
an
occasional
choice
and
easy
task
after
an
endless
oration
in
which
he
assured
us
times
without
number
that
he
was
poor
but
honest
just
the
man
required
for
our
very
valuable
baggage
which
the
expensive
leather
boxes
proved
it
and
which
in
his
hands
would
be
perfectly
safe
among
the
robbers
that
swarmed
in
the
road
we
walked
close
beside
admitted
his
willingness
as
a
special
favor
to
accompany
us
to
la
mesa
eighteen
miles
away
for
the
paltry
sum
of
we
offered
fifty
and
he
left
in
scorn
at
the
alcalde
s
office
that
official
had
been
due
only
an
hour
or
so
and
naturally
had
not
yet
arrived
we
spread
our
resplendent
document
before
his
secretary
demanding
a
cargador
at
once
that
s
the
way
the
haughty
traveler
always
did
in
the
accounts
we
had
read
of
journeys
in
the
andes
but
serrazuela
was
evidently
the
secretary
stepped
to
the
door
and
beckoned
a
few
haughty
nearer
suggesting
in
a
soft
voice
that
perhaps
as
a
great
favor
to
him
personally
one
of
them
would
go
with
los
señores
and
carry
a
very
light
little
one
by
one
they
replied
in
as
solemn
tones
as
if
they
fancied
we
believed
them
that
they
were
already
engaged
for
the
day
that
they
had
a
lame
knee
or
a
sore
back
or
an
exacting
spouse
or
were
in
mourning
for
a
mother
s
third
cousin
and
faded
silently
away
among
the
last
to
go
was
our
original
poor
but
honest
applicant
who
paused
to
ask
whether
the
offer
we
had
made
was
paper
or
gold
because
if
we
meant
the
latter
he
just
then
the
alcalde
s
perfume
gladdened
our
nostrils
and
one
of
the
men
rounded
up
by
a
soldier
having
accepted
what
was
still
an
exorbitant
day
s
wage
we
were
off
at
last
the
day
was
bright
and
sunny
behind
across
the
sabana
masses
of
white
clouds
hung
over
unseen
bogotá
and
her
distant
black
range
i
could
keep
pace
with
rain
in
the
face
as
hays
had
dubbed
our
new
acquisition
only
by
holding
each
foot
a
second
or
more
before
setting
it
down
if
i
paused
to
let
him
get
a
bit
ahead
he
was
sure
to
wait
for
me
a
few
yards
beyond
ten
cents
spent
in
a
little
wayside
drunkery
gave
him
new
life
but
only
for
a
short
once
he
fell
in
with
a
friend
driving
an
empty
donkey
and
for
a
space
we
moved
a
little
less
slowly
then
the
friend
turned
off
toward
his
village
and
with
a
groan
rain
in
the
face
took
up
his
burden
again
and
crawled
behind
me
soon
after
we
came
to
the
edge
of
the
world
the
sabana
had
ended
abruptly
before
us
lay
only
a
great
swirling
white
mist
into
which
disappeared
the
old
spanish
highway
that
led
in
broad
low
steps
down
and
ever
down
into
an
unseen
abyss
the
carrier
began
to
tremble
visibly
the
year
before
he
confided
in
a
choked
whisper
he
had
been
held
up
here
by
bandits
who
had
killed
and
robbed
his
employer
only
when
one
of
us
went
close
in
front
and
the
other
at
his
heels
could
he
be
induced
to
move
forward
and
downward
now
and
then
a
group
of
indians
men
and
women
as
heavily
burdened
as
their
loomed
forth
from
the
clouds
and
toiled
slowly
upward
past
us
an
hour
down
we
came
upon
a
rock
grotto
into
which
bareheaded
arrieros
were
crawling
with
lighted
candles
it
is
explained
one
of
them
that
san
antonio
once
appeared
here
and
all
caminantes
stop
to
pray
because
he
aids
protects
and
betters
are
you
sure
i
asked
curious
to
hear
his
answer
sure
he
cried
staring
at
me
with
startled
eyes
señor
i
have
been
arriero
on
this
road
since
i
was
a
boy
always
bringing
a
candle
for
san
antonio
in
all
those
years
i
have
been
robbed
only
three
then
i
had
no
he
crossed
himself
thrice
in
the
intricate
south
american
manner
and
sped
noiselessly
away
into
the
clouds
after
his
animals
it
may
have
been
our
failure
to
offer
tribute
to
the
saint
of
the
grotto
that
all
but
brought
our
expedition
to
grief
thus
early
the
mist
had
thinned
and
the
landscape
that
opened
out
became
more
and
more
tropical
a
single
then
clusters
of
them
grew
up
beside
me
banana
plants
and
clumps
of
bamboo
like
gigantic
ferns
nodded
sluggishly
a
spreading
tree
pink
with
blossoms
added
the
needed
touch
of
color
suddenly
i
realized
that
my
companions
were
not
with
me
and
sat
down
to
wait
a
passed
i
strolled
back
along
the
road
then
hurried
upward
at
sharper
pace
fully
a
mile
up
i
sighted
hays
driving
the
indian
before
him
they
had
already
tiptoed
on
the
edge
of
an
adventure
barely
had
i
passed
from
view
when
there
had
fallen
in
with
them
one
by
one
four
fellows
carrying
sugarcane
staffs
as
thirst
came
each
fell
to
peeling
and
munching
his
cane
hays
lost
in
some
problem
of
urdu
philology
was
suddenly
recalled
to
the
material
world
by
a
throat
gurgle
from
rain
in
the
he
looked
up
to
find
the
four
wayfarers
long
in
hand
still
ostensibly
engaged
in
peeling
sugarcane
but
closing
in
around
him
and
the
shivering
cargador
hays
had
taken
for
fiction
the
stories
of
dangers
on
the
road
and
his
automatic
was
packed
away
on
the
carrier
s
back
but
he
had
been
too
long
a
soldier
to
betray
anxiety
in
the
face
of
danger
the
quartet
continued
their
innocent
occupation
crowding
ever
closer
but
had
not
quite
summoned
up
courage
to
try
their
fortunes
against
so
a
gringo
when
they
fell
in
with
another
group
of
travelers
and
the
four
gradually
faded
away
behind
thenceforth
we
took
care
to
wear
our
weapons
in
plain
sight
rain
in
the
face
had
with
great
difficulty
been
coaxed
to
his
feet
again
when
darkness
fell
he
was
still
wheezing
slowly
onward
far
from
the
day
s
goal
the
abrupt
stony
descent
was
broken
now
and
then
by
sharp
rises
and
we
stumbled
and
sprawled
over
uncounted
loose
stones
and
solid
boulders
at
length
white
huts
began
to
stand
dimly
forth
from
the
night
the
voices
of
unseen
groups
in
the
doorways
under
faintly
suggested
thatch
roofs
fell
silent
with
astonishment
as
we
passed
and
in
a
climate
in
pleasant
contrast
to
that
of
bogotá
we
entered
at
last
the
little
hotel
of
la
mesa
rain
in
the
face
set
down
his
load
for
the
last
time
with
a
stage
groan
grasped
his
fee
after
the
customary
plea
for
more
and
with
the
parting
information
that
he
was
poor
but
honest
raised
his
wreck
of
a
straw
hat
and
disappeared
to
be
seen
no
more
morning
found
us
in
a
long
town
on
a
overhanging
a
great
tumbled
valley
still
a
mile
above
again
facing
the
problem
of
how
to
make
our
baggage
get
up
and
walk
when
we
had
tramped
a
hot
and
stony
without
getting
a
yard
further
on
our
journey
we
returned
to
the
hotel
hays
stretched
out
bed
and
drew
out
his
faithful
ramsey
bent
on
drowning
his
worldly
troubles
in
study
the
first
sentence
that
stepped
forth
from
the
page
inviting
translation
into
spanish
asserted
in
south
america
are
many
arid
regions
through
which
travel
and
the
transportation
of
baggage
is
yet
there
are
those
who
hold
that
are
not
closely
related
to
practical
life
well
on
in
the
day
however
we
did
get
two
feeble
youths
to
agree
to
carry
a
suitcase
each
to
jirardot
for
and
fare
back
to
la
mesa
at
this
rate
we
could
soon
have
better
afforded
to
build
a
railroad
indeed
we
had
already
reduced
to
an
absurdity
the
experiment
of
trying
to
mix
the
tramp
and
the
gentleman
a
sahib
said
kim
is
always
tied
to
his
it
dominates
every
movement
and
is
after
all
of
scant
value
in
proportion
to
the
burden
it
imposes
hire
a
carrier
and
he
is
always
intruding
upon
your
dreams
and
meditations
and
with
all
the
expense
and
trouble
no
article
of
the
pack
can
you
lay
hands
on
during
all
the
day
s
tramp
moreover
i
am
not
of
that
kind
that
can
make
a
beast
of
burden
of
my
i
soon
found
that
a
cargador
toiling
under
my
load
behind
me
made
me
far
more
weary
than
to
carry
it
myself
we
decided
to
revert
to
type
at
the
next
halt
and
play
the
sahib
no
longer
the
road
now
chiefly
unmade
descended
swiftly
into
the
genuine
tropics
and
the
next
afternoon
we
sweated
into
jirardot
on
the
magdalena
a
month
from
the
day
we
had
left
it
to
ascend
to
bogotá
for
all
our
resolutions
however
neither
of
us
contemplated
with
pleasure
the
prospect
of
turning
ourselves
into
we
set
afoot
word
that
we
would
pay
a
high
monthly
wage
to
any
lad
with
a
stout
back
and
no
particular
grade
of
intelligence
who
would
consent
to
leave
home
but
the
youths
of
jirardot
were
even
less
ambitious
than
those
of
the
capital
we
set
a
time
limit
advanced
it
and
at
last
fell
upon
our
possessions
with
the
rage
of
despair
what
we
did
not
succeed
in
throwing
away
we
made
into
two
bundles
of
the
maximum
weight
allowed
by
and
sent
them
down
the
magdalena
to
panama
and
quito
we
were
forced
to
sacrifice
even
the
library
which
did
not
matter
for
we
had
found
it
more
convenient
to
buy
native
novels
and
toss
them
away
leaf
by
leaf
thus
daily
reducing
our
load
moreover
we
had
resolved
to
read
thenceforth
only
the
literature
of
the
country
in
which
we
were
traveling
even
then
there
swung
from
our
shoulders
some
fifteen
pounds
each
besides
the
awkward
filled
with
films
and
chemicals
with
which
we
alternately
burdened
ourselves
when
we
crossed
the
little
over
the
magdalena
and
leaving
the
department
of
cundinamarca
behind
struck
off
into
that
of
tolima
illustration
approaching
the
central
cordillera
of
the
andes
a
typical
andean
or
royal
highway
with
a
bound
for
the
capital
an
extensive
plain
half
desert
with
drought
now
blazing
hot
and
sandy
spread
far
away
before
us
at
first
mud
huts
were
frequent
and
many
country
people
passed
driving
drooping
donkeys
curs
abounded
here
and
there
a
leper
squatted
beside
the
trail
languidly
held
out
his
supplicating
stumps
everywhere
were
the
hills
of
termite
ants
as
the
volcanoes
of
guatemala
while
trains
of
stinging
red
ones
crossed
the
road
at
frequent
intervals
fields
of
tobacco
and
corn
stood
shriveled
beneath
the
unclouded
sun
troops
of
horses
and
mules
laden
with
the
narcotic
weed
rolled
into
de
and
wrapped
in
dry
shuffled
past
in
the
dust
before
their
shrieking
and
whistling
arrieros
bound
for
jirardot
and
modern
transportation
the
still
a
royal
highway
in
spite
of
its
condition
passed
now
and
then
through
clumsy
swinging
gates
that
marked
the
limits
of
otherwise
unbounded
haciendas
we
met
several
haughty
horsemen
in
ruanas
and
the
conventional
wealth
of
accoutrement
and
once
a
cavalcade
of
men
and
women
the
latter
lurching
uncomfortably
back
and
forth
on
their
high
the
peon
behind
them
carried
on
his
back
a
large
chair
with
a
sheet
over
it
only
the
squalling
that
accompanied
him
suggesting
what
it
concealed
the
caste
system
was
noticeable
even
here
on
the
broad
plain
when
we
had
carriers
behind
us
natives
afoot
raised
their
hats
and
horsemen
gave
us
friendly
greetings
now
with
our
possessions
on
our
own
backs
we
received
only
frozen
stares
except
from
an
occasional
peon
who
grunted
at
us
as
equals
a
few
miles
beyond
the
magdalena
we
came
to
the
parting
of
the
ways
one
sandy
trail
led
south
to
neiva
and
popayán
the
other
with
which
we
swung
to
the
right
struck
off
for
ibagué
and
the
quindío
pass
over
the
central
cordillera
of
the
andes
we
took
this
longer
route
to
quito
that
we
might
traverse
the
great
cauca
valley
the
pedometer
registered
a
mere
ten
miles
when
we
halted
at
an
adobe
hut
that
to
the
natives
was
a
very
fine
a
bedraggled
old
woman
pottered
nearly
two
hours
over
a
stick
fire
in
the
back
yard
before
she
brought
us
two
fried
eggs
and
a
small
dish
of
fried
plantains
as
succulent
as
wooden
chips
our
bed
she
prepared
by
throwing
a
reed
mat
on
the
hardest
earth
floor
known
to
geography
and
by
no
means
as
level
as
the
surrounding
plain
my
shoes
and
leggings
did
poor
service
as
pillow
and
hays
charged
ramsey
with
lack
of
foresight
in
not
binding
his
grammar
in
upholstered
plush
we
were
awakened
from
the
first
nap
by
the
hubbub
of
a
group
of
nearly
all
women
who
piled
their
bundles
in
a
corner
and
stretched
themselves
out
on
such
as
we
had
left
unoccupied
yet
the
ethics
of
the
road
are
such
in
that
we
felt
no
misgiving
in
leaving
our
unprotected
possessions
on
a
bench
at
the
door
with
the
first
hint
of
dawn
our
stole
silently
away
hays
was
still
abed
when
i
struck
off
in
a
gorgeous
morning
across
a
sea
of
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
mountain
ranges
behind
with
distance
the
face
of
the
plateau
on
which
sits
bogotá
in
its
solitude
stretched
across
the
eastern
horizon
high
indeed
yet
how
slightly
above
the
earth
as
a
whole
ahead
the
rounded
cone
of
tolima
stood
sharply
forth
above
a
nearer
range
that
cut
off
its
base
while
a
tumbled
mountain
landscape
beyond
promised
less
monotonous
if
more
laborious
days
to
come
a
native
carpenter
working
on
the
new
toll
bridge
over
the
brawling
collo
river
assured
us
he
would
much
rather
be
on
the
road
with
us
but
that
unfortunately
he
was
contracted
for
a
time
broken
ground
and
rocky
foothills
cut
down
our
progress
soon
we
were
back
again
on
a
level
plain
of
vast
extent
a
bit
higher
than
the
preceding
a
garden
spot
in
fertility
though
largely
uncultivated
with
mountains
on
every
hand
and
tolima
close
on
the
west
as
i
had
already
found
in
honduras
these
upland
plains
perfectly
level
covered
with
grass
but
for
a
threading
of
faint
paths
all
following
the
same
general
direction
afford
the
finest
walking
in
the
world
never
hard
always
high
enough
to
catch
a
cool
breeze
often
shaded
generally
winding
enough
to
avoid
the
monotony
of
a
straight
road
they
make
the
journey
like
strolling
across
an
endless
lawn
or
through
some
vast
orchard
now
and
then
we
passed
a
tinkling
a
horseman
or
an
indian
pedestrian
but
never
a
vehicle
to
disturb
the
reflective
peace
of
a
perfect
tramp
every
hour
or
two
we
drifted
together
generally
at
a
hut
selling
a
beverage
of
crude
sugar
and
water
tasting
mildly
like
cider
and
extremely
every
species
of
appeared
horses
donkeys
steers
bulls
women
children
and
even
men
all
toiling
eastward
often
a
dozen
horses
marched
in
a
sort
of
lockstep
the
halter
of
each
tied
to
the
tail
of
the
animal
ahead
many
had
one
or
both
ears
cropped
short
not
by
some
accident
or
gratuitous
cruelty
as
we
at
first
imagined
but
as
a
system
of
branding
now
and
then
a
shifting
load
brought
an
arriero
running
to
throw
his
ruana
over
the
animal
s
eyes
it
until
it
was
prepared
to
go
on
again
one
of
more
than
forty
animals
was
loaded
with
large
boxes
marked

this
roundabout

panama
by

to
buenaventura
by
train
over
the
western
range
and
more
than
half
way
across
colombia
on
pack
animals
all
to
avoid
the
exorbitant
rates
of
steamers
up
the
magdalena
the
haciendas
of
this
region
producing
chiefly
tobacco
are
owned
by
absentee
landlords
and
managed
by
the
peon
laborers
are
paid
twenty
cents
a
day
with
food
arrieros
on
the
road
average
fifty
cents
a
day
and
find
themselves
a
few
of
the
latter
paused
to
inquire
our
destination
and
otherwise
satisfy
a
fathomless
curiosity
our
usual
answer
al
cauca
always
brought
forth
a
startled
cómo
por
tierra
by
land
in
the
andes
the
expression
is
used
with
no
thought
of
the
sea
as
an
alternative
but
as
the
opposite
of
a
caballo
on
horseback
occasionally
we
purposely
astounded
an
inquirer
by
telling
the
whole
truth
after
a
speechless
moment
in
which
his
face
clouded
over
with
an
unspoken
accusation
he
usually
answered
that
though
we
might
perhaps
fancy
we
were
walking
to
quito
we
were
misinformed
and
hurried
on
after
his
animals
without
even
the
customary
now
and
then
we
met
a
lone
arriero
singing
his
troubles
to
the
solitude
as
a
colombian
poet
has
it
and
once
i
was
overtaken
by
a
man
who
cried
breathlessly
as
soon
as
his
voice
could
reach
me
ha
visto
señor
un
muchachito
con
un
burro
vacío
to
which
i
could
only
reply
no
i
regret
to
have
to
tell
you
that
i
have
not
seen
a
small
boy
with
an
empty
donkey
and
watch
the
distracted
fellow
race
on
over
the
horizon
we
early
discovered
the
uselessness
of
asking
countrymen
of
the
andes
that
simple
little
question
how
far
is
it
ramsey
himself
could
not
have
catalogued
all
the
strange
answers
we
received
even
in
the
first
few
days
a
few
of
them
ran
perhaps
an
hour
only
an
hour
no
more
señor
but
because
there
is
much
cuesta
ascent
or
descent
perhaps
it
is
two
or
three
or
the
reply
came
how
far
on
foot
or
on
horseback
señor
or
more
often
by
sea
or
by
land
some
tossing
their
heads
toward
the
sun
replied
at
evening
prayers
you
are
there
or
shook
their
heads
with
no
will
not
arrive
todavía

is
still
how
far
more
or
less
an
hour
or
three
days
between
the
two
three
leagues
then
señores

keep
on

the
other
little
side
a

no
the
little
corner
no
more
little
above
no
más
bajita
down
below
it
remains
so
on
through
all
the
gamut
of
misinformation
never
a
simple
above
all
it
was
fatal
to
ask
a
leading
question
the
misinformant
was
sure
to
agree
with
us
at
all
costs
evidently
out
of
mere
politeness
one
might
fancy
the
ancient
rulers
of
the
andes
demanded
an
affirmative
answer
from
their
subjects
on
penalty
of
death
and
the
supposition
would
account
for
many
of
the
stories
of
miraculous
appearances
of
place
names
and
the
like
gathered
by
the
conquistadores
at
best
we
were
assured
no
hay
donde
is
no
place
to
lose
yourselves
were
almost
sure
to
strike
within
ten
minutes
a
misleading
fork
in
the
trail
with
fifteen
miles
behind
us
i
slipped
gratefully
from
under
my
awkward
thirty
pounds
before
one
of
a
cluster
of
thatched
huts
called
hotel
mi
casa
on
the
earth
floor
of
which
two
cots
were
placed
for
us
water

doled
out
grudgingly
washing
was
a
luxury
none
indulged
in
hays
was
busy
consuming
six
cigars
called
tobacos
comunes
that
had
cost
him
a
sum
total
of
one
cent
as
we
sat
before
the
hovel
watching
the
sunset
throw
its
reflections
on
the
red
cliffs
of
the
range
behind
us
the
day
went
out
like
an
extinguished
lamp
and
the
stars
came
suddenly
forth
in
striking
brilliancy
the
north
star
of
our
home
sky
was
now
below
the
horizon
and
many
a
long
month
was
due
to
pass
before
we
should
see
it
again

hays
seated
before
the
hotel
mi
casa
and
behind
one
of
his
cigars
watching
the
reflection
of
the
sunset
on
the
broken
range
we
had
climbed
during
a
long
stiff
day
illustration
a
bit
of
the
road
by
which
we
mounted
to
the
quindío
pass
over
the
central
range
with
forests
of
the
slender
palms
peculiar
to
the
region
the
trail
is
more
prone
to
pitch
headlong
up
or
down
the
mountainside
than
to
follow
a
flank
in
this
orderly
manner
the
plateau
ahead
was
even
vaster
than
it
seemed
i
had
walked
hours
next
morning
by
one
of
those
easy
haphazard
upland
trails
and
still
it
lay
endless
before
me
clumps
of
short
squat
trees
flecked
it
with
shadows
here
and
there
but
for
the
most
part
it
was
bare
alike
of
the
planting
of
nature
or
man
cattle
grazed
on
every
hand
and
went
and
came
frequently
in
every
direction
stood
row
upon
row
of
jagged
mountain
ranges
fading
away
into
the
haziest
distance
they
seemed
of
a
world
wholly
cut
off
from
the
whispering
stillness
of
the
broad
brown
plain
turning
i
could
see
untold
mile
upon
mile
behind
me
the
blue
central
cordillera
that
shut
off
the
valley
of
the
cauca
lay
piled
into
the
sky
ahead
like
a
hair
on
a
colored
glass
i
could
make
out
our
sharply
ascending
trail
of
the
days
to
come
crawling
upward
toward
the
quindío
on
the
rim
of
the
mountain
lap
that
holds
ibagué
spread
about
a
bulking
church
at
the
base
of
the
first
great
buttresses
of
the
chain
i
came
upon
hays
in
the
shade
of
a
leper
s
hut
before
the
marks
of
his
ailment
came
upon
him
the
outcast
had
climbed
with
his
mules
for
many
years
back
and
forth
over
the
great
barrier
and
something
like
a
tear
glistened
in
his
eye
as
we
turned
our
faces
toward
the
land
of
his
youth
the
hotel
paris
in
the
town
below
looked
a
century
old
with
its
quaint
wooden
rejas
of
colonial
days
to
peer
out
also
in
at
as
a
ibagueño
demonstrated
by
thrusting
his
face
in
upon
us
while
we
were
battling
with
the
stains
of
travel
when
i
took
him
to
task
he
answered
wonderingly
why
every
one
does
it
señor
and
refused
to
take
any
hint
short
of
a
basin
of
water
ibagué
capital
of
the
province
of
tolima
claims
the
count
takes
much
for
granted
it
is
a
peaceful
roomy
little
town
on
a
gentle
grassy
slope
where
every
resident
has
ample
space
to
put
up
his
chalky
little
cottage
yet
all
toe
the
street
line
as
if
fearful
of
missing
anything
that
might
unexpectedly
pass
with
almost
wholly
buildings
its
are
atrociously
cobbled
the
few
sidewalks
worn
perilously
slippery
and
barely
wide
enough
for
two
feet
at
once
a
stream
of
water
gurgles
down
each
street
through
cobbled
gutters
lulling
the
to
furnishing
a
convenient
means
of
washing
photographic
films
we
drank
less
often
however
after
we
had
strolled
up
to
the
edge
of
the
mountain
and
found
three
ladies
bathing
in
the
reservoir
on
a
corner
of
the
plaza
the
nephews
of
jorge
isaacs
greatest
of
colombian
novelists
run
a
clothing
store
but
it
was
our
misfortune
to
find
them
out
of
town
on
another
corner
i
made
my
way
up
an
aged
stone
stairway
of
one
of
the
rare
buildings
of
ibagué
to
the
alcalde
s
office
it
was
lined
with
documents
all
each
batch
marked
with
a
year
before
which
lounged
clerks
incessantly
rolling
cigarettes
when
he
had
read
our
government
paper
in
a
stage
whisper
the
youthful
mayor
at
once
put
the
town
entirely
at
our
disposal
i
suggested
schools
señor
ministro
de
instrucción
pública
he
called
out
with
long
oratorical
cadences
instantly
there
tiptoed
into
the
room
a
long
tremulous
man
of
fifty
almost
shabbily
dressed
though
of
course
with
what
had
once
been
a
white
collar
with
a
pedagogical
cast
of
countenance
and
a
chin
barely
an
inch
below
his
upper
lip
he
bowed
low
at
the
alcalde
s
orders
and
answered
that
the
matter
would
be
attended
to
at
toward
ten
next
morning
the
minister
of
public
instruction
who
had
evidently
laundered
his
collar
during
the
night
left
a
long
line
of
people
waiting
and
set
off
with
me
they
are
only
teachers
waiting
for
their
appointments
or
salaries
he
explained
we
halted
before
a
large
building
the
minister
knocked
meekly
with
his
cane
on
the
heavy
the
door
to
the
patio
and
was
finally
admitted
by
a
muscular
unshaven
priest
who
listened
to
our
request
at
some
length
and
at
last
led
us
to
an
older
churchman
suave
slender
outwardly
effusive
and
of
that
perfectly
polished
exterior
that
marks
the
jesuit
he
was
also
french
when
time
enough
had
elapsed
to
give
warning
of
our
coming
he
led
the
way
into
a
room
of
pupils
boys
of
six
or
seven
except
two
indian
youths
an
exceedingly
young
priest
giving
an
excellent
imitation
of
surprise
at
our
appearance
snapped
a
sort
of
wooden
and
the
entire
class
rose
to
their
feet
bowing
profoundly
some
other
formality
was
imminent
when
i
begged
the
teacher
to
go
on
with
the
lesson
just
as
if
i
were
not
there
he
exchanged
a
glance
with
his
superior
at
this
extraordinary
gringo
request
then
lined
the
class
up
in
military
ranks
and
set
them
to
reading
aloud
the
theme
was
strictly
religious
in
nature
and
most
of
the
words
of
four
or
five
syllables
as
often
as
the
clapper
sounded
the
boys
changed
to
next
and
read
with
such
fluency
that
only
the
tailend
of
a
phrase
here
and
there
was
intelligible
the
priest
made
no
corrections
or
criticisms
whatever
taught
indeed
as
he
might
have
turned
a
handle
i
fancied
the
pupils
extraordinarily
i
strolled
down
the
room
to
the
evident
horror
of
the
adults
and
noted
that
almost
none
of
them
had
the
book
open
at
the
page
they
were
in
a
room
i
was
asked
to
choose
the
lesson
and
suggested
geography
a
youth
passed
a
pointer
swiftly
over
a
spinning
off
a
description
learned
by
rote
of
the
principal
cities
the
youthful
priest
lifting
him
back
on
the
track
whenever
he
forgot
the
exact
language
of
the
original
and
came
to
a
wordless
halt
little
helpful
hints
accompanied
each
question
a
boy
stood
before
the
map
of
colombia
on
which
the
capital
was
printed
in
enormous
letters
what
city
did
quesada
found
in
asked
the
priest
blank
silence
from
the
boy
the
priest
bogotá
shouted
the
boy
my
smiled
complacently
at
his
wisdom
and
what
place
is
this
quizzed
the
teacher
pointing
to
a
strip
of
land
that
curved
like
a
tail
up
into
a
corner
of
the
map
panamá
shrieked
the
boy
a
province
of
colombia
which
is
now
in
rebellion
the
he
was
evidently
going
on
with
still
more
startling
information
when
the
all
but
imperceptible
twitching
of
an
eye
of
the
jesuit
superior
turned
the
pointer
to
other
climes
the
teacher
never
lost
an
opportunity
to
give
a
religious
twist
to
the
proceedings
a
boy
whose
pointer
hovered
over
the
mediterranean
mumbled
and
another
of
the
cities
is
nicea
ah
cried
the
priest
and
what
celebrated
event
in
the
history
of
mankind
took
place
in
nicea
the
great
council
of
the
church
in
which
began
the
youth
and
rattled
on
as
glibly
as
if
he
had
been
there
in
person
when
we
had
turned
out
into
the
street
the
shabby
little
ministro
became
confidential
explaining
that
the
colegio
toward
which
we
were
headed
had
once
held
a
large
student
body
but
now
señor
owing
to
political
changes
before
the
priests
interfered
i
had
an
excellent
experienced
normal
graduate
in
charge
of
that
first
class
he
sighed
as
we
parted
and
now
we
have
that
boy
in
a
cassock
bah
we
left
ibagué
by
taking
the
wrong
road
and
had
to
crawl
for
miles
along
the
steep
bank
of
a
mountain
stream
almost
back
to
town
before
we
were
set
right
then
began
one
of
the
greatest
climbs
of
our
joint
careers
round
and
round
in
intoxicated
zigzags
went
the
trail
as
if
dizzy
at
the
task
before
it
down
into
several
gullies
until
at
last
finding
no
other
means
of
escape
it
took
to
clambering
laboriously
upward
at
first
the
weather
was
hot
then
gradually
cooled
as
views
of
ibagué
and
its
surroundings
spread
out
below
us
the
buttresses
of
the
range
ahead
were
enormous
as
if
nature
planning
to
build
here
such
a
mountain
chain
as
never
before
had
started
the
outcropping
supports
on
her
most
gigantic
scale
toward
nine
i
realized
that
i
was
out
of
the
sunshine
and
no
longer
sweating
despite
the
swiftness
of
the
ascent
at
ten
i
paused
to
pick
wild
strawberries
along
the
way
it
did
not
seem
possible
to
mount
much
further
for
there
was
nothing
higher
visible
but
like
jack
of
the
beanstalk
i
climbed
on
entirely
out
of
the
clouds
that
wholly
shut
off
the
world
below
at
noon
when
i
stretched
out
on
a
swift
slope
to
read
a
few
pages
of
maría
immense
reaches
of
mountains
and
valleys
by
masses
of
mist
like
drapery
that
concealed
yet
revealed
their
plump
feminine
forms
lay
everywhere
below
and
about
me
over
all
the
tumbled
view
were
scattered
little
huts
of
mountaineers
each
in
a
setting
it
seemed
possible
to
have
reached
only
on
wings
the
hovel
where
we
planned
to
spend
the
night
refused
us
posada
and
as
dusk
fell
we
faced
an
all
but
perpendicular
mountain
wall
up
the
stony
face
of
which
the
trail
staggered
the
few
groups
of
men
we
met
carried
ancient
rifles
loosely
as
if
constantly
ready
for
action
at
dark
i
toiled
to
a
summit
to
find
hays
standing
before
a
mud
arguing
with
the
crude
mountaineers
who
would
have
sent
us
on
into
the
night
with
the
threadbare
spanish
prevarication
only
a
little
further
on
there
is
another
house
all
ready
to
receive
in
its
utter
lack
of
comfort
the
place
resembled
the
mountain
hamlets
of
northwestern
spain
the
people
were
shy
yet
once
won
over
there
is
no
bed
they
explained
but
there
is
perhaps
a
leather
you
can
sleep
by
and
by
the
woman
called
us
into
the
kitchen
for
a
bowl
of
hot
water
with
chunks
of
potato
and
an
egg
dropped
in
it
served
with
coarse
then
the
man
led
the
way
into
a
cell
made
entirely
of
mud
even
to
the
bench
along
the
wall
on
which
he
laid
a
hairy
cowhide
fortunately
he
returned
a
little
later
with
several
aged
a
tiny
girl
lighting
the
way
with
a
native
candle
or
we
should
not
have
slept
even
the
bit
we
did
streaks
of
pale
day
were
beginning
to
steal
through
the
chinks
in
our
chamber
when
the
woman
appeared
with
black
coffee
and
a
stony
corn
biscuit
and
we
were
off
for
another
day
of
stiff
ups
and
downs
stalking
down
a
descent
i
heard
a
shout
of
astonishment
from
hays
ahead
what
looked
like
an
ordinary
mountain
stream
cut
across
the
trail
at
the
bottom
of
a
sharp
little
gully
but
the
water
coming
from
the
bowels
of
tolima
that
stood
somewhere
above
us
in
the
mists
of
morning
was
almost
hot
we
had
both
been
on
the
road
in
many
a
clime
but
never
before
where
nature
was
kind
enough
to
heat
a
morning
bath
for
us
we
lost
no
time
in
stripping
for
a
luxury
rare
to
the
traveler
in
colombia
not
far
beyond
we
came
to
the
edge
of
the
valley
of
the
toche
away
below
like
a
miniature
painting
reposed
a
peaceful
little
vale
wholly
shut
in
by
sheer
mountain
walls
a
stream
meandering
the
length
of
it
it
took
us
an
hour
to
make
the
swift
stony
descent
not
all
get
down
so
safely
as
the
skeletons
of
a
horse
and
a
mule
their
shoes
still
on
testified
the
valley
floor
watered
by
the
stream
was
a
fertile
patch
of
earth
and
the
steep
mountain
flanks
were
planted
far
up
with
little
perpendicular
patches
of
corn
all
the
scene
seemed
as
far
removed
from
the
wide
world
as
if
on
another
sphere
a
rocky
trail
climbed
abruptly
up
out
of
the
valley
again
from
the
further
end
higher
than
ever
past
rare
houses
built
of
the
red
boards
of
a
tree
called
from
the
doors
of
which
stared
shy
people
in
bedraggled
tatters
the
quindío
pass
lies
only
feet
above
the
sea
but
that
by
no
means
represents
the
climbing
necessary
to
surmount
the
central
cordillera
of
the
andes
what
is
so
called
is
really
a
long
series
of
ranges
and
no
sooner
did
the
road
reach
some
lofty
summit
than
it
dived
as
swiftly
and
roughly
down
again
it
was
not
a
planned
road
like
the
highways
of
the
alps
but
one
grown
up
of
itself
a
jaguar
once
wandered
over
the
cordillera
a
man
followed
and
the
route
holds
to
the
same
course
toiling
like
gasping
for
breath
in
the
rarefied
air
we
fancied
a
score
of
times
that
we
had
reached
the
summit
only
to
see
the
trail
take
another
switchback
and
disclose
the
perfidious
fact
that
it
had
found
another
ridge
to
surmount
a
few
hundred
feet
above
the
toche
began
clumps
then
entire
forests
of
a
tall
slender
a
species
named
by
humboldt
on
his
journey
over
the
quindío
having
only
a
tuft
of
branches
at
the
top
these
were
often
torn
off
by
the
winds
that
rage
down
through
the
gullies
leaving
a
thing
as
unromantic
as
a
the
valley
below
opened
out
until
half
a
world
with
a
tinge
of
green
lay
below
and
around
us
words
are
hopelessly
inadequate
to
describe
this
bird
s
eye
view
of
range
upon
range
climbing
one
over
the
other
as
if
in
terror
to
escape
some
savage
pursuer
and
fading
away
into
the
dimmest
distance
the
sun
was
low
when
we
came
out
on
as
a
view
ahead
and
saw
the
morrow
s
task
laid
out
before
us
in
the
form
of
a
road
twisting
away
out
of
sight
over
a
great
mountain
barrier
draped
in
clouds
the
puro
quindío
or
chief
range
at
last
as
night
descended
we
entered
volcancito
an
unusually
large
adobe
building
on
a
bleak
slope
the
which
was
also
the
back
corredor
was
overrun
by
a
large
family
chiefly
small
girls
each
in
a
single
thin
cotton
garment
despite
the
wintry
mountain
air
chickens
dogs
and
gaunt
pigs
wandered
everywhere
without
restraint
in
a
corner
slouched
a
woman
sewing
garments
too
small
for
the
smallest
child
in
sight
our
plea
for
lodging
she
treated
with
scorn
volcancito
was
a
posada
not
a
hotel
the
difference
between
the
two
in
being
that
in
a
hotel
the
traveler
is
permitted
to
expect
certain
conveniences
while
in
a
posada
he
accepts
with
smiling
gratitude
whatever
fortune
chooses
to
furnish
him
we
have
only
two
guest
rooms
snapped
the
woman
when
we
persisted
as
if
the
mere
giving
of
the
information
was
an
unusual
favor
one
this
señor
has
with
his
wife
and
baby
the
other
belongs
to
the
the
successful
guest
was
an
actor
on
his
way
from
the
cauca
to
bogotá
a
handsome
fellow
much
for
such
a
journey
with
a
strikingly
beautiful
young
wife
as
we
noted
at
a
glance
through
the
door
but
there
are
five
rooms
on
this
side
of
the
house
i
suggested
family
rooms
shot
back
the
woman
and
this
little
room
in
the
corner
belongs
to
the
servant
she
mumbled
projecting
her
lips
toward
a
slatternly
young
female
who
was
at
that
moment
pursuing
a
thieving
pig
from
the
kitchen
anything
will
do
sighed
hays
gazing
abstractedly
after
the
servant
but
the
landlady
was
in
no
mood
for
crude
jokes
there
is
a
fine
house
with
rooms
and
beds
just
four
cuadros
on
she
lied
after
a
long
silence
fortunately
this
was
by
no
means
my
first
experience
with
the
favorite
trick
of
races
to
be
rid
of
importunate
guests
or
we
might
have
tramped
all
night
on
the
mountain
top
in
a
cold
as
penetrating
as
that
of
january
in
our
own
land
i
slipped
surreptitiously
from
under
my
pack
assuming
the
ingratiating
manner
that
is
the
last
resort
with
the
apathetic
people
of
the
andes
we
were
resolved
to
spend
the
night
there
though
it
be
in
walking
the
floor
nothing
is
more
fatal
than
to
appear
anxious
in
such
situations
however
and
we
affected
indifference
and
a
pretense
of
having
accepted
her
verdict
what
fine
little
girls
she
had
so
pretty
and
healthy
indeed
they
looked
like
irish
children
was
she
not
from
the
cauca
she
was
ah
the
magnificent
cauca
the
most
beautiful
she
was
soon
lost
in
a
panegyric
of
her
native
valley
as
she
shuffled
from
kitchen
to
and
back
again
magnificent
indeed
i
agreed
and
in
only
a
day
or
two
we
shall
be
there
so
what
matters
a
night
of
freezing
in
the
mountains
by
the
way
la
señora
can
perhaps
sell
us
a
bit
of
coffee
and
a
bite
to
eat
before
we
set
out
to
tramp
all
night
she
grunted
assent
and
a
later
we
were
seated
before
a
plentiful
if
not
epicurean
meal
before
we
had
finished
it
she
remarked
casually
that
we
might
arrange
ourselves
in
the
room
with
the
arrieros
the
is
seldom
a
pleasant
but
compared
with
a
night
out
of
doors
probably
with
rain
at
more
than
two
miles
above
any
arrangement
was
welcome
we
fancied
lodging
had
first
been
refused
us
because
we
were
foreigners
soon
after
supper
we
were
undeceived
out
of
the
darkness
came
the
sound
of
horse
s
hoofs
and
as
it
ceased
there
burst
in
upon
us
a
handsome
young
colombian
of
somewhat
dissolute
features
in
the
ruana
false
ringing
cartwheel
spurs
and
the
other
hundred
and
one
details
of
equipment
the
rules
of
society
require
of
a
colombian
of
gente
decente
rank
who
travels
ahorse
he
gave
greeting
in
the
explosive
speech
of
his
class
and
requested
lodging
answered
the
woman
in
the
identical
cold
monotone
she
had
used
toward
us
the
newcomer
began
dancing
on
air
waving
his
ladylike
hands
on
which
gleamed
several
rings
above
him
eloquence
worthy
of
a
world
congress
poured
from
his
lips
his
eyes
seemed
to
spurt
fire
repeated
the
landlady
in
the
same
dead
voice
but
señora
it
is
imperative
i
have
a
lady
with
me
anything
will
as
these
family
rooms
snapped
the
caucana
as
if
reciting
a
learned
dialogue
but
your
guest
rooms
one
this
señor
has
with
his
wife
and
baby
the
other
belongs
to
the
also
jerking
her
head
slightly
toward
us
to
these
two
but
what
am
i
to
do
shrieked
the
colombian
and
a
lady
with
me
the
woman
muttered
a
quién
sabe
with
a
careless
shrug
of
the
shoulders
and
continued
her
sewing
without
looking
up
after
a
last
vain
oration
the
colombian
dashed
off
angrily
his
horseback
garments
standing
out
at
excited
angles
and
rode
away
into
the
night
the
way
we
had
come
toward
better
luck
perhaps
among
the
huts
at
the
bottom
of
the
valley
bedtime
comes
at
about
seven
in
these
wintry
fireless
lightless
regions
the
landlady
now
thoroughly
mollified
broke
off
some
story
of
the
wonders
of
the
cauca
to
say
next
to
the
room
of
the
arrieros
is
a
where
you
can
sleep
alone
many
foreigners
are
englishmen
to
the
rural
slept
in
why
had
she
not
offered
us
this
upon
our
arrival
lack
of
confidence
probably
common
to
these
simple
people
as
is
the
that
can
be
unearthed
by
a
few
simple
wiles
and
flatteries
the
room
was
narrow
but
long
and
high
strewn
with
the
of
mules
and
the
crude
implements
of
husbandry
with
harnesses
and
a
chaos
of
trappings
but
with
space
left
to
spread
on
the
earth
floor
several
wrappings
of
moreover
the
woman
sent
us
a
blanket
later
a
boy
entered
carrying
a
candle
and
a
little
round
hard
pillow
which
he
delivered
with
a
speech
apologetic
with
diminutives
after
the
fashion
of
the
country
people
of
the
andes

illustration
on
the
western
side
of
the
central
cordillera
the
trail
drops
quickly
down
into
the
tropics
again
here
and
there
through
lanes
of
immense
bamboos
hays
in
the
middle
distance
has
his
turn
at
carrying
the
illustration
the
first
days
on
the
road
showing
how
i
would
have
traveled
by
choice
in
contrast
to
later
illustrations
of
how
i
did
travel
by
necessity
for
all
these
unexpected
luxuries
i
can
hardly
say
we
slept
well
before
an
hour
had
passed
a
polar
winter
began
to
creep
up
through
the
earth
floor
through
the
through
our
flesh
and
bones
and
what
with
the
aching
of
hips
and
other
salient
points
that
fitted
the
uneven
earth
poorly
the
night
passed
in
an
endless
series
of
against
death
in
the
polar
seas
as
my
legs
grew
cold
beyond
endurance
i
found
a
pair
of
the
false
of
impervious
cloth
worn
by
horsemen
of
the
region
but
my
glee
quickly
evaporated
for
they
proved
to
be
designed
for
a
boy
humboldt
spent
ten
days
in
passing
the
quindío
we
sincerely
hoped
he
had
been
better
supplied
with
blankets
even
though
his
journey
was
in
the
summer
season
for
once
we
felt
no
anger
when
a
hoarse
rooster
at
last
greeted
the
first
graying
of
the
darkness
the
entire
night
had
been
a
battle
for
the
that
had
covered
us
alternately
with
creaking
legs
i
stepped
out
into
the
icy
dawn
and
washed
in
a
wind
that
cut
through
me
as
a
rapier
through
a
man
of
straw
it
was
still
and
vast
seas
of
mist
lay
in
the
bottomless
chasms
roundabout
far
away
to
the
east
where
the
dawn
and
the
warmth
come
from
was
a
triangular
patch
of
sky
low
down
between
two
ranges
and
roofed
with
black
clouds
in
which
the
brilliant
sunshine
of
the
was
already
blazing
red
one
of
the
bravest
acts
of
my
life
was
the
stripping
and
changing
to
road
garb
after
which
we
joined
the
family
and
our
huddled
under
shawls
and
blankets
with
folds
of
woolen
cloth
about
their
throats
and
over
their
noses
the
landlady
still
abed
issued
orders
from
within
to
her
girls
and
the
servant
one
of
these
threw
into
a
pot
of
boiling
water
a
of
native
chocolate
swirled
the
mess
with
a
stick
and
served
it
to
us
with
a
mixture
of
mashed
corn
and
rice
it
was
no
homeopathic
food
but
none
lasts
long
in
this
thin
exhilarating
air
while
climbing
swift
mountain
flanks
when
we
inquired
for
our
bill
the
woman
called
out
that
we
owed
twenty
cents
each
and
bade
us
godspeed
to
her
beloved
cauca
the
road
was
heavy
and
slippery
with
the
rain
that
had
fallen
during
the
night
the
air
still
sharp
and
penetrating
we
had
all
but
spent
the
night
on
the
summit
of
the
quindío
for
the
highest
point
was
but
three
miles
beyond
though
three
miles
of
climbing
without
respite
most
of
the
world
was
shut
off
by
great
out
of
which
came
frequently
the
bawling
of
arrieros
cursing
their
weary
animals
upward
now
and
then
we
stopped
on
knolls
above
the
trail
to
watch
these
andean
pass
many
of
the
were
bulls
and
steers
of
slight
strength
as
such
compared
to
the
horse
or
mule
but
the
surest
if
slowest
in
muddy
going
the
arrieros
almost
without
exception
wore
as
ruanas
what
had
once
been
united
states
the
stripes
and
lettering
still
clear
upon
them
there
were
several
ridges
so
nearly
alike
in
altitude
that
the
exact
summit
might
easily
have
been
in
dispute
but
at
last
we
reached
the
dividing
line
between
the
departments
of
tolima
and
the
cauca
marked
with
a
post
planted
roundabout
with
scores
of
little
twig
crosses
set
up
by
pious
arrieros
and
travelers
we
were
so
completely
surrounded
by
impenetrable
swirling
mist
that
we
could
see
nothing
whatever
but
the
patch
of
cold
wet
ground
underfoot
a
few
dismal
dripping
bushes
and
here
and
there
a
dishevelled
shivering
flower
of
some
hardy
species
not
a
glimpse
was
to
be
had
of
tolima
that
must
lie
piled
into
the
mist
somewhere
close
at
hand
it
was
the
highest
either
of
us
had
ever
been
in
the
world
while
we
appreciated
the
eminence
it
was
no
place
for
men
gifted
with
profane
vocabularies
to
linger
and
we
were
soon
legging
it
down
the
western
slope
out
of
cloudland
chapter
iv
along
the
cauca
valley
on
the
cauca
side
like
the
french
slope
of
the
pyrenees
the
central
cordillera
of
the
andes
descends
almost
abruptly
to
the
valley
as
we
emerged
from
the
clouds
a
brilliant
sun
lighted
up
vast
landscapes
of
labyrinthian
hills
and
vales
mottled
with
cloud
shadows
bits
of
our
road
ahead
scratched
here
and
there
on
salient
knobs
and
slopes
far
below
with
noon
appeared
the
first
broad
view
of
the
rolling
cauca
valley
nestled
between
the
central
and
the
western
ranges
a
bare
thousand
feet
above
still
as
some
lake
the
little
town
of
salento
in
the
lap
of
an
undulating
bright
green
plain
rose
slowly
up
to
meet
us
we
marched
to
the
alcalde
s
office
in
a
building
of
compacted
clay
only
to
find
the
alcalde
like
beds
for
travelers
out
of
town
a
stupid
clerk
in
a
room
full
of
musty
papers
of
varying
antiquity
admitted
it
was
too
bad
salento
was
so
but
made
no
move
to
decrease
that
backwardness
and
strangers
who
arrive
i
asked
generally
bring
their
beds
with
them
he
replied
or
if
not
they
do
the
best
they
we
took
the
hint
and
forcible
possession
of
an
empty
room
opening
on
the
plaza
when
after
a
basin
bath
i
strolled
out
into
the
town
to
mention
our
strange
exotic
desire
for
sleeping
accommodations
a
dozen
of
the
most
influential
citizens
also
admitted
it
was
too
bad
where
did
we
come
from
and
where
were
we
going
hays
for
once
had
better
luck
having
left
the
mention
of
beds
to
simmer
in
the
mind
of
one
sanchez
who
amused
himself
at
shopkeeping
on
a
corner
of
the
square
he
was
called
over
at
dark
and
offered
the
use
of
several
woolly
white
blankets
that
hung
for
sale
from
the
blackened
beams
of
the
shop
ceiling
sanchez
was
shocked
beyond
measure
when
we
started
to
carry
them
across
the
plaza
ourselves
he
called
for
a
boy
nine
responded
and
the
winner
expressed
great
gratitude
when
we
rewarded
him
with
a
ragged
paper
cent
we
improvised
seats
and
sat
gazing
out
through
the
wooden
reja
far
away
on
a
fuzzy
hillside
our
road
of
the
morning
grew
dim
and
faded
out
like
an
unfixed
photograph
and
a
night
lighted
only
by
stars
quickly
settled
down
out
of
its
black
immensity
came
a
little
later
the
jangling
of
tiny
bells
across
the
plaza
filed
a
half
hundred
boys
in
column
of
twos
weirdly
lighted
by
flickering
torches
utterly
silent
in
their
bare
feet
from
another
direction
came
a
similar
procession
of
girls
the
two
columns
joined
at
the
door
of
the
little
bamboo
church
the
twin
towers
of
which
stood
dimly
forth
against
the
background
of
darkness
and
passed
within
together
for
an
hour
a
weird
infantile
chanting
in
chorus
sounded
almost
unbrokenly
then
the
congregation
filed
forth
again
and
melted
away
into
the
humid
summer
night
the
faint
silhouette
of
the
priest
showed
him
leaning
over
the
reja
of
his
the
fitful
glow
of
his
cigarette
the
only
light
in
town
until
that
too
died
out
and
left
only
the
brilliant
tropical
stars
above
beyond
salento
a
rolling
fertile
land
lay
on
every
hand
in
the
great
forests
spreading
far
up
the
range
beside
and
behind
us
the
most
conspicuous
of
the
flora
was
the
a
tree
that
stood
forth
everywhere
like
blotches
on
the
green
landscape
the
slender
of
the
eastern
slope
had
not
passed
the
crest
the
uplands
of
the
valley
were
still
all
but
covered
with
virgin
forests
it
set
us
reflecting
what
might
have
been
had
the
mayflower
turned
southward
and
peopled
this
land
of
rich
soil
and
unrivalled
climate
instead
of
that
bleak
and
rigorous
country
we
had
left
behind
or
would
this
peerless
climate
have
made
us
too
salentinos
at
the
hut
where
we
paid
two
cents
for
great
bowls
of
creamy
milk
there
was
a
decision
to
make
one
branch
of
the
trail
led
to
pereira
the
other
to
filandia
we
tossed
a
coin
it
fell
tails
and
we
struck
off
to
the
left
by
a
soft
dirt
road
filandia
was
a
quaint
old
place
with
a
wonderful
gingerbread
church
on
a
hilltop
that
rolled
languidly
away
on
all
sides
to
mountain
ridges
the
town
seemed
never
to
have
seen
a
foreigner
before
perhaps
travelers
hitherto
had
all
gone
by
way
of
pereira
when
i
attempted
to
take
a
picture
the
entire
population
men
women
and
the
very
babies
crowded
so
close
around
me
that
i
could
not
fight
them
back
to
a
focal
distance
illustration
like
those
of
the
days
of
shakespeare
the
theater
of
cartago
consists
of
a
split
bamboo
with
a
tile
the
patio
of
the
the
more
expensive
seats
are

in
the
balcony
of
the
second
story
the
populace
stands
in
the
barnyard
illustration
cartago
watching
our
departure
two
of
the
doors
show
no
occupants
only
because
these
had
dodged
inside
to
call
the
rest
of
the
family
by
the
next
afternoon
we
were
in
quite
a
different
country
in
the
tropics
again
with
bananas
and
endless
lanes
of
bamboo
that
giant
fern
as
useful
as
it
is
beautiful
which
nature
so
unkindly
denied
the
north
it
was
not
a
temperature
for
the
preserving
of
undeveloped
films
and
i
paused
with
the
tank
beside
the
first
clear
stream
the
sun
gave
out
before
i
had
more
than
hung
the
strips
up
to
dry
drops
of
rain
began
to
fall
and
night
came
on
apace
i
pushed
on
grasping
a
wet
film
in
either
hand
to
my
dismay
the
road
turned
to
a
narrow
path
through
thick
weeds
and
for
a
long
five
miles
with
eighteen
already
in
my
legs
and
thirty
pounds
straining
from
my
shoulders
i
tramped
swiftly
forward
striving
to
hold
the
films
out
of
reach
of
the
weeds
the
natives
blacker
and
blacker
as
we
descended
stared
with
amazement
from
their
little
bamboo
shelters
along
the
train
to
see
a
strange
being
scurry
by
holding
high
above
his
head
two
black
strips
like
tibetan
small
wonder
they
crossed
themselves
in
superstitious
awe
the
night
had
grown
completely
in
about
me
when
hays
hailed
me
from
an
unseen
doorway
he
had
already
bespoken
supper
and
engaged
a
room
with
a
bed
of
split
bamboo
and
a
quilted
straw
mattress
for
me
was
brought
what
a
candle
proved
to
be
a
canvas
cot
made
of
a
in
the
was
a
lounging
chair
of
the
same
material
where
did
you
get
it
i
asked
the
host
what
that
fine
strong
cloth
oh
the
government
always
has
plenty
of
that
to
sell
he
replied
placidly
the
same
damp
pulsating
jungle
fenced
us
in
all
the
next
morning
far
ahead
across
the
spread
of
the
cauca
valley
the
jagged
blue
line
of
the
western
cordillera
that
cuts
it
off
from
the
pacific
stretched
to
north
and
south
as
far
as
the
eye
could
command
in
some
places
five
ranges
visible
one
behind
the
other
at
noon
suddenly
topping
a
jungled
knoll
we
caught
sight
of
the
town
of
cartago
reddish
with
the
hue
of
its
in
the
center
of
town
dying
away
in
whitish
and
lines
of
outskirt
hovels
it
was
hours
later
that
we
reached
the
level
of
the
valley
floor
and
strolled
in
heavy
grass
through
a
suburb
into
the
weedy
central
plaza
with
a
populous
graveyard
before
the
keel
of
the
mayflower
was
laid
cartago
has
not
yet
advanced
to
what
any
mushroom
town
of
our
west
can
boast
at
the
age
of
three
months
negroes
were
everywhere
though
there
was
no
sharp
and
pure
whites
were
rare
the
cauca
is
to
colombia
what
our
south
is
to
the
united
states
in
colonial
times
slaves
were
imported
in
large
numbers
up
the
atrato
river
and
to
this
day
the
shiftless
african
lolls
in
his
ragged
cabins
speaking
a
spanish
it
was
hard
to
believe
was
not
english
so
exactly
did
their
slovenly
drawl
resemble
that
of
our
southern
states
the
hotel
advertised
comodidad
prontitud
y
esmero
comfort
promptness
and
specklessness
three
things
above
all
others
a
south
american
hotel
is
surest
not
to
have
there
is
never
an
office
in
these
hotels
of
the
andes
a
peanut
vendor
somewhere
up
the
street
is
manager
and
all
the
town
assists
while
the
traveler
makes
his
bargain
if
indeed
it
does
not
gather
en
masse
to
watch
his
ablutions
the
rooms
are
commonly
stark
empty
and
are
furnished
to
order
as
one
selects
a
chicken
on
the
hoof
for
the
evening
meal
we
had
to
implore
each
and
every
requisite
from
cots
to
water
separately
and
individually
several
times
over
before
they
were
supplied
when
we
insisted
on
two
towels
the
young
but
toothless
landlady
muttering
something
about
the
curious
ways
of
tore
an
aged
sheet
in
two
and
as
long
as
we
remained
made
us
feel
that
guests
were
an
unmitigated
nuisance
among
the
luxuries
of
the
town
was
wheat
bread
when
we
demanded
it
with
our
meals
a
boy
of
polished
little
other
sent
wandering
down
to
market
with
a
bushel
basket
on
his
arm
and
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
came
slouching
back
with
three
tiny
buns
lost
in
the
bottom
of
it
but
for
all
the
slovenliness
of
its
habits
antiquarians
would
have
found
cartago
s
hotel
interesting
the
barnyard
patio
into
which
we
flung
our
formed
the
parquet
or
stalls
of
the
village
theater
at
the
back
of
it
was
an
open
building
of
split
bamboo
floor
and
sides
violently
painted
forming
a
stage
quite
similar
to
that
of
shakespeare
s
day
a
score
of
bottles
hung
by
the
neck
like
corpses
at
some
medieval
wholesale
hanging
fringed
the
outer
edge
of
the
platform
the
ends
or
drippings
of
what
had
been
tallow
candles
showing
that
they
had
served
as
proscenium
footlights
the
veranda
our
was
marked
with
the
numbers
of
boxes
around
its
three
sides
from
the
unspeakable
kitchen
to
the
even
more
unmentionable
servants
quarters
when
plays
were
given
the
masses
stood
in
the
yard
below
and
the
looked
on
from
their
chairs
along
the
veranda
unfortunately
histrionic
talent
seemed
to
have
completely
died
out
in
cartago
only
the
languid
tinkling
of
a
or
native
guitar
marked
the
long
evenings
in
which
we
watched
the
golden
moon
rise
over
the
bit
of
mossy
roof
and
the
tops
of
two
lazily
swaying
framed
by
our
balcony
window
if
my
knowledge
of
cartago
is
meager
it
is
because
i
spent
most
of
my
days
there
in
mailing
a
notebook
the
was
the
lower
story
of
a
building
cornering
on
the
plaza
when
i
first
made
my
appearance
its
heavy
wooden
doors
studded
with
immense
were
securely
bolted
is
the
closed
i
asked
a
sí
señor
the
mails
only
came
in
yesterday
but
you
can
knock
and
perhaps
knocking
brought
no
result
an
hour
or
more
later
i
tried
again
with
no
better
luck
early
the
next
afternoon
however
i
found
my
way
in
by
an
inner
door
of
the
patio
though
the
place
was
still
officially
closed
the
two
rooms
looked
much
like
a
garret
of
long
standing
but
by
no
means
like
a
scattered
everywhere
over
floor
and
window
seats
on
decrepit
chairs
and
crippled
tables
lay
fat
all
stout
and
new
from
the
chief
countries
of
the
globe
the
outgoing
colombian
correspondence
was
already
packed
in
aged
pieces
of
mail
of
all
sizes
lay
tumbled
and
littered
over
the
entire
two
rooms
fully
half
of
it
was
from
the
united
states
particularly
pamphlets
and
packages
from
patent
medicine
houses
four
men
dressed
in
great
dignity
and
in
cartago
s
most
correct
attire
with
gloves
and
canes
on
chairs
beside
them
were
seated
around
a
table
smoking
cigarettes
i
handed
one
of
them
the
wrapped
notebook
it
passed
slowly
from
hand
to
hand
each
feeling
it
over
not
so
much
out
of
curiosity
though
that
was
by
no
means
lacking
as
striving
to
bring
his
attention
down
to
it
then
all
four
fell
to
perusing
a
postal
union
but
found
everything
except
the
information
needed
finally
one
rose
and
referred
the
matter
respectfully
to
a
man
evidently
a
superior
seated
in
state
at
a
corner
table
the
rate
was
found
to
be
one
peso
for
each
fifty
grams
the
official
turned
back
and
wandered
for
some
time
at
random
about
the
two
rooms
fingering
the
parcel
over
and
over
and
scratching
his
head
in
a
vain
effort
to
recall
what
he
had
set
out
to
find
he
discovered
it
at
last
ancient
it
found
it
too
small
tried
another
and
spent
an
ample
five
minutes
juggling
with
the
odds
and
ends
that
served
as
weights
before
he
computed
the
balance
then
he
drifted
languidly
back
to
his
companions
in
inefficiency
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
closed
it
again
and
rambled
once
more
across
the
room
to
the
scales
he
had
forgotten
the
weight
this
time
he
took
no
chances
but
announced
the
figures
aloud
and
wrote
them
on
the
parcel
those
who
do
not
know
the
south
american
will
have
difficulty
in
believing
that
the
division
of
this
by
fifty
without
troubling
for
fractions
presented
a
real
problem
all
four
began
pencilling
long
lines
of
figures
on
as
many
sheets
of
paper
several
minutes
passed
before
one
of
them
ventured
to
show
his
result
the
others
compared
and
amid
a
sage
shaking
of
heads
one
announced
solemnly
seven
cents
señor
while
the
rest
gazed
dreamily
at
me
out
of
the
tops
of
their
eyes
as
if
wondering
whether
i
should
weather
the
shock
of
so
great
an
expense
and
registered
seventeen
cents
i
added
for
i
did
not
care
to
have
the
parcel
lie
a
month
or
two
about
the
earth
floor
of
cartago
s
or
find
its
final
in
the
back
yard
when
the
suggestion
had
penetrated
one
of
the
quartet
sat
down
to
enter
the
grave
transaction
in
a
large
ledger
i
still
needed
a
stamp
the
oldest
of
the
four
shuffled
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
sat
down
adjusted
his
legs
and
slowly
pulled
out
a
drawer
stuffed
with
every
manner
of
rubbish
rolled
cigarettes
phials
of
patent
medicine
everything
that
may
come
by
mail
finally
dug
up
a
battered
pasteboard
box
that
had
once
held
no
american
thread
from
this
he
fished
out
a
small
sheet
of
stamps
carefully
tore
one
off
at
the
perforation
first
on
one
side
then
on
the
other
put
the
sheet
back
in
the
the
back
in
the
drawer
carefully
closed
the
latter
and
handed
me
the
stamp
i
tossed
before
him
a
silver
piece
he
opened
the
drawer
again
clawed
out
of
a
far
corner
a
wad
of
those
ragged
bills
indigenous
to
colombia
laid
out
eight
of
them
counted
them
a
second
time
sat
staring
at
them
a
long
minute
while
his
attention
went
on
furlough
asked
one
of
his
colleagues
to
count
them
which
the
latter
did
twice
at
the
same
vertiginous
speed
and
finally
pushed
them
toward
me
with
a
hesitative
movement
as
if
he
were
sure
he
was
losing
somewhere
in
the
transaction
but
could
not
exactly
figure
out
where
meanwhile
he
of
the
ledger
rose
from
dotting
the
last
i
of
an
entry
that
stretched
in
nicely
shaded
copybook
letters
entirely
across
the
double
page
begged
me
to
do
him
the
honor
to
be
seated
dipped
the
clumsy
steel
pen
into
the
dusty
inkwell
and
with
a
wealth
of
politenesses
requested
me
to
sign
when
i
had
done
so
he
gazed
long
and
dreamily
at
the
signature
longer
still
at
space
in
general
and
finally
put
the
parcel
carefully
away
in
a
drawer
with
neither
stamp
nor
mark
of
identification
upon
it
illustration
along
the
cauca
valley
we
met
not
only
peasants
bound
to
town
with
a
load
of
wood
and
carrying
their
prize
roosters
but
now
and
then
the
corpse
of
a
woman
being
brought
in
for
christian
burial
service
after
which
it
would
be
carried
back
and
buried
in
her
native
hills
illustration
in
places
the
cauca
valley
so
swarmed
with
locusts
that
they
rose
like
an
immense
screen
before
us
as
we
advanced
struck
us
in
the
face
in
scores
and
made
a
sound
like
that
of
a
distant
waterfall
but
i
protested
do
you
give
no
receipt
for
registered
mail
great
excitement
arose
among
the
officials
and
the
persons
waiting
ostensibly
to
buy
a
stamp
a
long
conference
ensued
it
is
señor
said
the
postmaster
himself
rising
and
turning
to
me
with
regal
courtesy
that
no
blank
receipts
have
been
sent
from
bogotá
yet
this
year
however
he
called
aside
the
custodian
of
the
precious
ledger
and
gave
him
long
whispered
instructions
the
latter
hunted
up
a
sheet
of
foolscap
stamped
it
carefully
with
the
office
seal
and
wrote
out
with
long
legal
penmanship
is
still
an
art
in
receipt
for
the
parcel
this
he
tore
off
and
carried
across
to
the
postmaster
who
carefully
preparing
another
pen
signed
it
with
his
full
name
not
forgetting
the
elaborate
beneath
it
then
he
read
it
carefully
over
once
more
seemed
dissatisfied
with
something
and
finally
called
the
attention
of
the
writer
to
the
rough
edge
he
had
left
in
tearing
off
the
paper
instructing
him
to
lay
it
under
a
ruler
and
trim
it
with
a
sharp
knife
the
subordinate
did
so
and
at
last
delivered
to
me
a
memento
i
still
have
in
my
possession
to
one
unacquainted
with
ways
the
episode
may
seem
overdrawn
i
have
told
it
however
without
exaggeration
from
the
moment
i
handed
over
the
parcel
until
i
emerged
receipt
in
hand
there
had
elapsed
one
hour
and
twenty
minutes
nor
is
such
a
scene
unusual
from
the
rio
grande
southward
government
offices
are
filled
with
just
such
human
driftwood
and
it
is
common
experience
to
see
several
staid
and
pompous
men
in
spend
more
than
an
hour
doing
what
an
average
american
boy
would
accomplish
in
two
minutes
swinging
due
south
next
morning
through
the
perpetual
summer
of
the
flat
cauca
valley
we
fell
in
with
a
straggling
band
of
nearly
a
hundred
youths
they
were
conscripts
recruited
under
the
new
military
law
of
colombia
chosen
by
lot
to
make
up
the
quota
of
the
province
of
antioquia
bound
south
from
medellín
for
six
months
compulsory
service
the
majority
were
countrymen
some
dressed
in
the
wrecks
of
european
suits
were
undeveloped
boys
of
the
towns
hobbling
painfully
along
on
bruised
and
blistered
feet
bare
except
for
their
cloth
alpargatas
among
the
latter
was
one
policarpo
a
young
fellow
of
high
intelligence
and
considerable
education
who
had
a
very
clear
notion
of
the
weak
spots
in
his
native
land
though
no
inkling
of
a
workable
remedy
another
carried
a
as
well
as
a
pleasing
baritone
voice
and
struck
up
at
every
opportunity
the
languidly
mournful
music
of
the
region
the
highway
now
was
a
series
of
interwoven
paths
fording
the
smaller
streams
crossing
the
larger
on
little
bamboo
bridges
with
faded
thatched
roofs
it
was
hot
yet
not
of
the
oppressive
heat
our
most
northern
states
know
in
all
along
the
way
were
flowers
of
many
colors
and
broad
vistas
of
greenest
grass
stretched
far
across
slightly
rolling
plains
wherever
woods
and
jungle
did
not
choke
it
out
bands
of
butterflies
often
of
the
most
gorgeous
hues
flickered
here
and
there
across
the
face
of
the
landscape
insects
hummed
contentedly
and
lizards
scuttled
away
through
the
fallen
leaves
singing
birds
of
many
kinds
abounded
flocks
of
little
parrots
brilliant
green
in
color
flitted
in
and
out
of
the
bamboo
groves
shrieking
noisily
at
their
games
here
and
there
fences
of
split
bamboo
of
weave
shut
in
a
little
cultivated
patch
and
all
day
long
the
western
cordillera
with
its
wrinkled
folds
and
prominences
stretching
endlessly
north
and
south
seemed
to
cut
off
the
cauca
like
a
world
apart
then
for
a
space
there
were
no
habitations
except
an
abandoned
hut
or
two
and
the
ruins
of
several
razed
ones
the
recruits
murmured
something
about
an
epidemic
but
none
appeared
to
know
anything
definite
concerning
it
at
length
we
descended
through
a
shallow
valley
and
from
then
on
locusts
called
in
the
cauca
rose
in
vast
clouds
as
we
advanced
covering
the
ground
before
us
and
veiling
all
the
landscape
as
with
a
great
screen
new
myriads
rising
at
every
step
until
they
struck
us
incessantly
in
the
face
and
filled
our
ears
with
a
sound
as
of
some
great
waterfall
at
a
distance
in
bogotá
we
had
wondered
to
find
an
important
government
department
entitled
comisión
para
la
extinción
de
la
langosta
now
it
seemed
small
indeed
to
cope
with
the
problem
at
intervals
cactus
hedges
bounded
the
way
and
the
of
desert
lands
stretched
forth
its
stiff
arms
into
the
brilliant
sky
the
cauca
was
suffering
one
of
its
periodical
droughts
and
the
accompanying
scourge
of
locusts
after
which
it
would
bloom
again
like
a
tropical
garden
the
recruits
so
monopolized
accommodations
at
the
village
of
had
not
the
remnant
of
an
to
explain
its
we
had
to
share
a
room
with
three
natives
who
permitted
no
ventilation
whatever
at
four
they
rose
to
light
candles
and
feed
their
mules
and
sat
vociferously
discussing
nothing
at
all
until
daybreak
they
spent
more
time
harnessing
themselves
than
their
animals
for
the
colombian
never
dreams
of
riding
in
anything
less
than
the
complete
outfit
demanded
by
local
convention
a
panama
sombrero
de
junco
or
the
finer
jipijapa
he
calls
his
head
over
his
usual
clothing
which
must
include
coat
vest
cravat
gloves
and
white
collar
no
matter
how
far
he
may
be
from
civilization
nor
what
the
temperature
he
wears
a
ruana
a
garment
similar
to
the
of
mexico
or
the
poncho
in
the
vicinity
of
bogotá
this
is
of
heavy
wool
and
dark
in
color
in
the
cauca
it
is
the
de
of
cotton
generally
gay
with
stripes
beneath
this
the
horseman
wears
ample
false
held
together
by
strips
front
and
back
and
at
the
bottom
sometimes
these
are
of
cowhide
or
shaggy
with
long
white
hair
reminiscent
of
the
chaps
of
our
cowboys
far
more
common
are
those
of
de
rubber
cloth
consisting
of
two
thicknesses
of
canvas
and
rubber
woven
into
an
impenetrable
yet
flexible
material
nearly
an
eighth
of
an
inch
thick
then
come
his
huge
spurs
his
or
lariat
of
twisted
rawhide
hanging
from
his
wrist
his
or
leather
saddlebags
between
his
legs
his
a
long
pouch
arched
over
the
cantel
of
his
saddle
like
a
cavalryman
s
his
long
stirrups
and
usually
a
parasol
or
umbrella
hanging
at
his
side
if
indeed
it
does
not
shade
him
as
he
rides
no
colombian
caballero
who
aspires
to
retain
his
rank
as
such
would
venture
to
mount
a
horse
while
lacking
any
item
of
this
equipment
one
trembles
to
think
what
might
happen
to
a
needing
to
ride
instantly
for
the
doctor
who
could
not
lay
hands
on
his
or
who
had
mislaid
his
gloves
the
cauca
was
now
a
broad
dry
treeless
region
without
streams
though
little
humped
bridges
lifted
us
across
the
waterless
beds
of
what
would
be
such
at
other
seasons
and
which
still
retained
the
name
of
river
in
local
parlance
arrieros
of
this
section
put
red
bands
about
the
brows
of
their
horses
and
mules
perhaps
only
for
the
purpose
of
identification
but
giving
the
animals
the
coy
appearance
of
coquettish
girls
as
we
advanced
the
long
drought
grew
more
and
more
in
evidence
across
the
valley
floor
lay
scattered
the
bleached
bones
of
scores
of
cattle
that
had
died
of
thirst
policarpo
and
i
falling
behind
were
in
danger
of
suffering
the
same
fate
for
the
band
of
recruits
like
another
locust
horde
drank
the
world
ahead
wholly
dry
the
rare
hovels
and
amateur
shops
along
the
way
were
prepared
to
feed
and
minister
to
the
thirst
of
only
the
customary
few
daily
travelers
not
to
the
of
us
that
suddenly
descended
upon
them
out
of
the
north
without
warning
hays
and
i
were
forced
to
stride
on
past
the
avalanche
of
humanity
for
here
and
there
we
got
huge
glasses
of
the
favorite
native
beverage
at
a
cent
or
two
each
so
many
travelers
have
pictured
the
making
of
this
by
toothless
old
women
chewing
yuca
and
spitting
it
into
a
tub
to
ferment
that
the
impression
should
be
corrected
at
the
outset
that
custom
does
exist
but
it
is
found
only
among
the
untamed
tribes
of
the
upper
reaches
of
the
amazon
scarcely
trodden
by
one
in
ten
thousand
south
american
travelers
all
down
the
great
andean
chain
this
nectar
of
the
incas
is
made
chiefly
of
maize
though
also
of
other
grains
berries
and
of
almost
any
vegetable
matter
that
will
ferment
by
just
as
agreeable
processes
as
any
other
cooking
operation
of
the
same
region
the
notion
of
cleanliness
is
at
best
rudimentary
among
the
country
people
of
south
america
yet
the
brewing
of
chicha
certainly
compares
favorably
with
the
ways
of
our
average
a
chicha
indeed
resembles
somewhat
in
taste
the
best
cider
and
is
the
surest
i
have
yet
encountered
distinctly
superior
in
this
respect
to
beer
many
were
the
chicha
recipes
i
gathered
along
the
andes
for
the
interest
of
those
who
wish
to
temper
a
hot
summer
day
with
an
excellent
heritage
from
the
ancient
inca
civilization
let
me
translate
the
most
common
one
chicha

morocho

hard
ripe
corn
is
one
of
the
several
excellent
species
of
maize
that
like
certain
grades
of
the
potato
has
never
been
carried
from
its
original
andean
habitat
to
the
rest
of
the
world
shell
and
boil
for
two
hours
let
it
cool
then
grind
or
crush
under
a
stone
sprinkling
from
time
to
time
with
some
of
the
water
in
which
it
has
been
boiled
keep
this

in
a
jar
as
it
is
needed
mix
with
water
one
soupspoonful
of
the

add
cloves
a
very
little
vanilla
and
as
much
sugar
or
as
is
considered
necessary
mix
with
an
equal
amount
of
cold
water
and
place
in
jars
to
ferment
once
fermented
it
is
ready
to
illustration
worse
than
the
locusts
was
the
flock
of
recruits
that
until
we
outdistanced
them
ate
and
drank
up
everything
the
amateur
shops
tended
by
leprous
old
women
afforded
along
the
way
illustration
the
of
tuluá
with
the
cross
that
protects
it
against
all
sorts
of
those
which
befall
it
we
reached
zarzal
beyond
a
blistered
plain
soon
after
noon
with
nineteen
miles
already
behind
us
it
was
thus
we
would
always
have
arrived
the
day
s
work
done
early
in
the
afternoon
to
wash
eat
and
loaf
awhile
on
the
canvas
cots
in
our
room
then
to
loll
in
the
rawhide
chairs
on
the
broad
veranda
before
our
door
reading
the
literature
of
the
country
languidly
watching
the
afternoon
shower
and
taking
a
stroll
in
the
evening
for
exercise
in
the
andes
however
the
itinerary
is
subjected
to
a
haphazard
arrangement
of
that
make
so
ideal
a
plan
impossible
we
gave
orders
for
dinner
and
supper
upon
our
arrival
the
ignorant
old
landlord
literally
hung
over
us
as
we
ate
fingering
our
dishes
and
even
our
food
the
place
might
with
entire
justice
have
advertised
personal
at
two
we
finished
a
heavy
dinner
at
our
host
waddled
in
to
announce
that
the
large
supper
we
had
ordered
was
ready
we
managed
to
plead
off
until
five
but
for
that
concession
were
obliged
to
eat
the
meal
cold
as
an
abandoned
hope
a
heavy
rain
during
the
coming
seemed
to
have
broken
the
long
the
going
for
the
first
few
hours
until
the
blazing
sun
had
dried
up
the
gumbo
mud
a
richer
region
appeared
as
we
advanced
once
or
twice
it
seemed
as
if
the
central
and
western
ranges
were
about
to
join
hands
and
cut
us
off
but
the
unmade
road
always
found
a
way
through
with
at
most
an
occasional
dip
or
a
slight
winding
climb
during
the
hot
afternoon
we
picked
up
a
recruit
straggler
complaining
of
fever
the
entire
company
was
scattered
for
miles
along
the
valley
as
often
panting
in
a
patch
of
shade
as
hobbling
forward
on
their
blistered
feet
magnificent
trees
stood
out
here
and
there
across
the
rich
bottom
lands
often
the
way
led
through
dense
bamboo
groves
that
waved
their
gigantic
plumes
lazily
in
the
summer
air
here
and
there
the
vegetation
vaulted
entirely
over
a
river
into
which
filtered
only
a
few
rays
of
sun
as
through
the
roof
of
an
abandoned
ruin
occasionally
we
came
upon
a
a
little
farm
with
a
tiny
thatched
hut
faded
with
age
its
floor
of
trampled
earth
surrounded
by
coffee
bushes
and
other
fruit
trees
of
the
tropics
the
sometimes
recently
dwelling
furnished
only
with
a
few
crude
leather
stools
a
wooden
bench
a
lame
table
and
a
few
and
dishes
of
native
pottery
pigs
and
chickens
treated
the
family
with
perfect
equality
under
the
trees
meditated
old
donkeys
broken
down
by
a
lifetime
of
toil
under
heartless
drivers
we
were
indeed
approaching
the
scene
of
maría
in
all
its
photographic
detail
we
prepared
to
leave
tuluá
early
but
we
reckoned
without
our
host
who
was
a
of
nasty
temper
and
stupid
wit
and
no
faith
in
gold
coin
hays
offered
him
a
gold
piece
in
payment
of
our
bill
but
he
demanded
paper
of
the
we
had
none
left
and
a
mulatto
boy
was
sent
out
to
change
the
scorned
yellow
metal
an
hour
elapsed
without
a
second
sight
of
him
when
another
had
drifted
into
the
past
a
search
party
was
organized
investigation
showed
that
the
emissary
had
tried
to
change
the
coin
in
a
couple
of
shops
and
had
then
faded
away
it
was
nearly
noon
when
he
reappeared
the
coin
still
in
his
clenched
hand
he
had
fallen
into
a
game
with
other
boys
and
forgotten
his
errand
we
took
the
task
upon
ourselves
one
after
another
drowsy
wondering
shopkeepers
looked
the
coin
over
as
a
great
curiosity
and
handed
it
back
announcing
that
the
changing
would
be
muy
trabajoso
very
laborious
the
speaker
but
that
we
could
get
it
changed
en
to
as
partes
anywhere
which
as
usual
meant
nowhere
at
last
a
merchant
suggested
that
it
would
be
changed
wherever
we
bought
anything
we
called
his
bluff
by
picking
out
a
notebook
on
his
shelves
and
had
heaped
up
before
us
nearly
in
ragged
billetes
del
país
of
chiefly
one
and
values
the
wad
was
burdensome
but
to
be
caught
on
the
road
in
the
andes
without
small
money
is
often
to
go
hungry
if
not
indeed
thirsty
this
particular
shopkeeper
prided
himself
on
a
knowledge
of
geography
and
the
affairs
of
the
exterior
the
outside
world
above
the
average
of
his
as
we
turned
away
he
called
after
us
by
the
way
do
los
señores
come
from
new
york
or
from
the
united
states
it
was
a
subtle
distinction
we
had
not
to
that
moment
recognized
the
ancient
city
of
buga
one
of
the
largest
in
the
cauca
valley
was
already
familiar
to
us
from
the
pages
of
but
seeing
is
too
often
disillusionment
in
these
cities
of
the
andes
particularly
those
in
which
the
imagination
has
already
dwelt
to
have
seen
one
long
cobbled
unswept
street
of
buga
was
to
have
seen
them
all
checkerboard
in
plan
the
monotonous
line
of
its
continuous
all
standing
close
to
the
street
in
a
strict
right
dress
broken
here
and
there
by
a
massive
stretched
away
out
of
sight
in
both
directions
at
first
glimpse
it
seemed
unduly
modest
in
claiming
only
ten
thousand
inhabitants
when
we
found
that
every
dwelling
had
a
patio
and
a
garden
of
its
own
within
we
realized
that
a
andean
town
is
by
no
means
so
large
as
it
looks
the
place
was
stagnant
as
a
its
main
plaza
a
splendid
study
in
still
yet
buga
was
old
before
boston
was
founded
and
is
favored
with
a
soil
and
climate
superior
to
the
best
of
new
england
in
a
region
where
fruit
should
have
been
unlimited
the
only
shop
that
offered
any
for
sale
was
slightly
stocked
with
a
few
green
samples
the
old
woman
who
kept
it
bestirred
herself
to
finger
over
several
of
her
wares
and
advised
us
to
come
back
mañana
or
the
day
after
when
they
had
had
time
to
ripen
perhaps
it
is
unjust
to
expect
of
buga
the
energy
and
movement
of
a
white
man
s
town
at
least
it
has
unrivalled
evenings
in
which
after
the
sun
has
set
gloriously
over
the
western
range
the
traveler
can
lean
over
the
parapet
of
the
massive
old
spanish
bridge
of
many
the
spaniards
built
to
stay
yet
stayed
a
rise
and
listening
to
the
chatter
of
the
shallow
little
guadalajara
de
las
piedras
that
flanks
the
town
on
the
south
buga
is
a
holy
city
far
above
all
else
bulks
a
modern
gothic
church
of
real
bricks
transported
from
overseas
are
not
de
los
milagros
filled
with
more
religious
trophies
than
any
hindu
temple
we
were
accosted
in
the
nave
by
a
priest
who
inquired
our
desires
with
a
brusk
qué
se
le
ofrece
that
plainly
revealed
his
knowledge
that
we
were
not
of
the
his
familiarity
with
the
outside
world
was
on
a
par
with
that
of
most
colombians
when
we
answered
his
question
of
nationality
by
announcing
ourselves
americans
he
replied
complacently
ah
yes
finding
unheeded
his
strong
hint
to
leave
he
at
length
led
the
way
up
a
ladder
to
a
cell
above
and
back
of
the
altar
here
he
lighted
a
candle
and
fell
on
his
knees
before
the
miraculous
crucifix
the
figure
of
which
was
smeared
with
red
paint
to
simulate
blood
pilgrims
flock
to
buga
from
hundreds
of
miles
around
to
the
themselves
however
their
miracle
seems
to
offer
little
more
than
a
means
of
easy
income
through
the
hawking
of
crucifixes
and
holy
lithographs
to
their
pious
visitors
like
puree
benares
or
lourdes
the
holy
city
is
more
holy
at
a
distance
than
to
those
who
loll
through
life
in
its
shadows
and
it
was
only
at
el
cerrito
a
day
s
march
beyond
that
we
heard
the
story
of
the
milagroso
de
buga
in
all
its
details
in
a
faintly
lighted
corredor
we
sat
with
three
old
women
the
natural
authorities
on
such
subjects
who
told
the
tale
in
low
awed
voices
their
eyes
glowing
in
the
night
with
the
miracle
of
it
their
tongues
breaking
in
frequently
with
a
qué
le
parece
what
do
you
think
of
that
the
miraculous
recital
proceeded
long
years
ago
more
than
two
centuries
when
buga
was
nothing
but
a
row
of
thatched
on
the
bank
of
the
babbling
guadalajara
de
las
piedras
a
very
poor
and
pious
woman
used
to
come
every
day
to
wash
clothes
at
the
river
brink
the
clothes
of
others
that
is
for
you
must
know
that
she
had
long
been
trying
to
get
together
sixty
cents
to
buy
a
crucifix
to
set
up
in
her
hut
where
she
had
nothing
whatever
to
pray
to
at
last
she
economized
the
sixty
cents
and
was
toiling
away
on
the
bank
of
the
guadalajara
dreaming
of
the
joy
of
setting
up
the
crucifix
in
her
on
the
morrow
when
a
poor
lame
man
of
buga
came
by
and
told
her
he
owed
sixty
cents
to
a
rich
caballero
and
would
be
put
in
prison
for
debt
if
he
did
not
pay
it
that
very
night
the
poor
washerwoman
drew
from
within
her
garments
the
silver
she
had
so
carefully
hidden
away
and
gave
it
to
the
lame
man
to
pay
his
debt
the
next
three
days
later
here
a
great
dispute
arose
among
our
the
poor
woman
was
washing
and
praying
that
she
might
some
day
gather
together
another
sixty
cents
there
floated
squarely
into
her
open
hands
and
mixed
itself
up
with
the
was
washing
a
a
little
box
in
which
there
was
illustration
a
view
of
the
sacred
city
of
buga
with
the
new
church
erected
in
honor
of
the
miraculous
virgin
illustration
a
horseman
of
the
cauca
in
full
regalia
in
addition
to
his
town
garb
coat
and
all
he
would
be
a
social
outcast
who
did
not
wear
a
panama
hat
gloves
a
or
poncho
light
in
color
and
weight
or
false
of
and
or
huge
spurs
his
other
possessions
he
carries
in
his
the
long
pouch
on
his
cantel
and
inserts
his
feet
in
heavy
fancily
carved
brass
only
a
simple
little
cross
the
spokeswoman
said
but
she
having
at
that
moment
to
step
into
the
shop
to
sell
two
biscuits
the
others
assured
us
in
hoarse
whispers
that
this
version
was
entirely
erroneous
it
was
not
a
simple
cross
but
a
crucifix
with
a
cristo
attached
just
exactly
the
same
that
you
see
in
el
milagroso
de
buga
only
very
tiny
in
fact
this
momentous
point
in
buga
s
history
i
am
forced
to
leave
unsettled
reporting
merely
what
i
heard
in
the
dark
corredor
of
el
cerrito
the
woman
took
this
and
set
it
up
on
the
wall
of
her
to
her
surprise
and
alarm
the
to
grow
qué
le
parece
it
grew
even
during
the
night
and
the
noises
of
its
stretching
kept
her
awake
when
it
had
grown
to
twice
its
original
size
she
became
so
alarmed
that
she
went
and
told
the
village
curate
the
padre
scoffed
at
her
story
saying
such
things
were
not
possible
ye
of
little
faith
miracles
were
no
longer
done
but
when
she
showed
him
the
thing
lo
it
was
even
then
growing
so
the
priest
took
it
away
with
priests
still
it
grew
it
grew
until
it
reached
the
size
you
see
it
in
el
milagroso
de
buga
then
the
padre
had
an
intimation
from
the
blessed
virgin
that
a
church
should
be
built
on
the
spot
where
the
had
been
found
and
he
called
all
the
people
together
to
build
it
they
put
the
miracle
behind
the
altar
and
there
it
remained
more
than
two
hundred
years
in
the
church
which
is
the
beside
el
milagroso
then
in
the
great
temple
of
bricks
was
raised
for
it
had
long
been
that
those
who
would
worship
and
be
cured
by
the
miraculous
one
could
not
get
into
the
old
church
and
the
milagroso
was
moved
to
the
new
temple
as
easily
as
if
it
were
a
mere
image
of
wood
though
all
the
world
well
knows
that
it
moves
only
when
it
wishes
and
if
it
does
not
all
the
horses
in
the
cauca
can
not
stir
it
and
is
it
true
that
el
milagroso
has
cured
many
invalids
i
asked
all
three
exploded
in
the
colombian
manner
of
expressing
great
truths
such
as
is
buga
larger
than
tuluá
is
it
colder
in
zarzal
than
in
el
cerrito
why
but
from
an
embarrassment
of
proofs
of
the
miraculous
power
of
the
milagroso
of
buga
i
have
space
only
for
this
a
woman
of
sonson
had
been
with
rheumatism
for
twenty
years
at
last
when
they
had
grown
large
enough
her
sons
carried
her
to
buga
and
placed
her
in
a
chair
before
el
milagroso
as
she
prayed
she
leaned
forward
and
touched
the
toe
of
the
miraculous
one
whereupon
she
at
once
rose
up
from
her
chair
perfectly
well
and
walked
home
to
sonson
many
miles
away
that
every
one
in
the
cauca
valley
knows
for
it
happened
only
the
other
year
and
also
put
in
another
of
the
old
women
bent
on
rounding
out
the
story
el
milagroso
can
turn
a
woman
young
and
beautiful
again
back
to
the
day
of
her
marriage
and
the
age
of
eh
began
hays
sitting
up
then
why
but
no
the
question
would
be
unkind
it
is
too
it
was
in
el
cerrito
that
we
first
began
inquiries
about
jorge
isaacs
those
who
have
sought
information
of
carlyle
in
chelsea
or
of
goethe
in
frankfurt
will
be
surprised
to
know
that
the
people
of
el
cerrito
had
heard
of
the
author
of
maría
though
the
corner
and
his
neighbors
spoke
of
him
with
something
of
the
scorn
active
men
of
the
world
always
feel
for
mere
men
of
letters
even
though
they
were
not
averse
to
basking
in
the
sunshine
of
his
fame
some
one
led
us
to
the
little
bridge
below
which
the
village
gossips
and
washes
its
scanty
clothes
and
pointed
away
to
the
east
far
across
the
valley
on
the
lower
skirts
of
the
central
range
we
could
see
plainly
the
novela
casa
the
story
house
a
mere
white
speck
on
the
distant
mountain
flank
there
were
few
spots
in
colombia
to
which
i
had
looked
forward
with
more
interest
than
this
scene
of
south
america
s
greatest
novel
and
the
home
of
its
author
with
the
first
graying
of
the
night
i
was
astir
and
we
were
off
by
sunrise
along
a
trail
at
right
angles
to
our
route
to
ecuador
several
times
this
seemed
to
lose
its
way
and
split
up
in
hopeless
indecision
but
the
house
of
my
fathers
gleaming
steadily
on
the
of
the
central
range
piloted
us
forward
the
only
building
to
be
seen
except
those
on
the
floor
of
the
plain
it
stood
just
high
enough
to
gaze
out
across
the
great
valley
a
single
evergreen
tree
slender
as
a
close
beside
it
the
sun
shot
down
its
rays
as
if
bent
on
setting
on
fire
all
that
the
foliage
of
the
trees
did
not
defend
from
its
rage
when
we
came
to
the
edge
of
the
plain
broken
by
ravines
in
which
we
separated
in
an
attempt
to
keep
together
there
was
nothing
left
but
to
strike
an
unmarked
course
for
the
goal
my
own
soon
plunged
down
into
a
gully
hundreds
of
feet
deep
thick
in
jungle
a
stream
the
zabaletas
of
maría
monologuing
at
its
bottom
i
wandered
long
beside
it
before
i
could
tear
my
way
across
and
longer
still
before
i
found
the
suggestion
of
a
path
by
which
to
climb
out
again
beyond
were
slightly
sloping
brown
fields
with
grazing
herds
and
immense
black
rocks
protruding
from
the
soil
and
behind
the
indistinct
valley
majestic
and
silent
stretched
mile
upon
mile
to
the
wall
of
the
western
cordillera
over
the
crest
of
the
andes
above
hung
like
an
immense
veil
dense
masses
of
fog
from
which
the
winds
of
the
sierra
above
snatched
rags
of
clouds
that
floated
lazily
away
to
the
westward
then
all
at
once
the
modest
little
white
house
appeared
close
at
hand
in
a
grove
of
evergreens
backed
by
the
mountain
flank
i
climbed
a
stone
wall
and
mounting
through
another
brown
field
pushed
open
a
heavy
rustic
gate
to
find
myself
at
last
at
the
home
of
a
woman
of
olive
complexion
with
streaming
in
this
corner
of
the
cauca
far
from
the
royal
highway
travelers
to
say
nothing
of
foreigners
are
rare
me
in
speechless
amazement
as
dripping
with
twelve
miles
of
struggle
i
mounted
the
steps
of
the
house
on
the
veranda
i
was
met
by
a
veritable
delegation
of
women
and
children
headed
by
a
man
who
announced
himself
as
camilo
durán
hacendado
entirely
at
my
service
the
family
was
of
the
farmer
class
of
the
cauca
a
bit
awkward
yet
proud
of
their
rank
in
society
lightly
clad
in
rural
dress
and
decidedly
excited
at
the
extraordinary
event
of
a
visit
by
a
foreigner
from
presented
a
document
from
the
alcalde
of
bogotá
signed
by
none
other
than
the
nephew
of
that
same
don
jorge
for
whom
their
home
was
famous
a
negro
boy
whom
one
might
have
taken
for
juan
angel
in
person
his
woolly
head
protruding
through
the
crown
of
what
had
long
since
been
a
native
straw
hat
came
running
with
a
chair
as
i
sat
down
in
the
cool
corredor
surrounded
by
the
admiring
family
durán
called
for
glasses
and
a
bottle
and
just
then
hays
head
appeared
above
the
stone
fence
of
the
inner
corral
and
his
always
leisurely
legs
brought
him
up
the
steps
to
be
introduced
as
that
very
whom
the
valued
communication
from
bogotá
read
by
natives
the
aguardiente
which
was
ardent
water
indeed
arrived
a
moment
later
and
when
durán
had
drunk
our
health
and
we
his
we
turned
to
look
about
us
would
we
see
novela
we
would
indeed
and
rising
entered
it
the
story
house
was
a
more
modest
dwelling
than
the
imagination
pictures
during
the
reading
of
but
then
all
the
cauca
and
its
ways
and
people
are
simple
and
unassuming
to
the
american
point
of
view
typical
of
the
hacienda
houses
of
the
region
it
was
of
one
story
arranged
with
due
regard
for
the
natural
resources
and
the
needs
of
the
place
and
climate
built
of
stone
and
adobe
it
gave
evidence
of
being
periodically
disguised
under
a
coating
of
whitewash
the
long
deep
veranda
was
flanked
by
two
corner
rooms
and
like
them
floored
with
what
the
french
call
tiles
that
remained
cool
even
at
cauca
noonday
its
thick
walls
were
shaded
by
a
low
projecting
tile
roof
over
the
genuine
been
painted
in
what
hays
referred
to
as
letters
the
information

george
isaacs
the
main
hall
or
parlor
took
up
the
entire
depth
of
the
house
from
the
front
to
the
back
veranda
the
corredor
de
la
montaña
of
the
novel
and
was
fitted
with
heavy
furniture
of
which
an
immense
dining
table
of
construction
formed
the
center
flanking
this
chief
chamber
were
the
private
rooms
of
the
family
that
at
the
corner
of
the
house
encroaching
on
the
front
corredor
had
been
the
room
of
efraín
the
hero
and
of
the
novelist
himself
back
of
it
came
the
the
writer
s
picture
of
which
was
so
photographic
that
we
were
almost
startled
not
to
find
maría
and
emma
and
her
mother
busy
with
their
sewing
at
the
back
across
the
main
hall
stood
the
a
small
chapel
with
the
same
simple
image
of
the
virgin
perhaps
before
which
maría
had
so
often
prayed
in
vain
for
a
happy
life
behind
the
back
veranda
stood
a
wing
barely
connected
with
the
house
proper
with
a
kitchen
clay
and
the
staring
white
eyes
of
negro
servants
of
all
sizes
that
seemed
ornaments
of
the
and
blackened
place
the
entire
dwelling
was
as
densely
inhabited
as
a
new
york
tenement
besides
the
dozen
boys
and
girls
of
olive
tint
and
several
women
of
the
durán
family
servants
and
negroes
swarmed
and
piccaninnies
peered
from
every
opening
and
corner
the
way
led
through
the
across
the
now
weedy
garden
to
the
pila
de
maría
a
pool
in
the
bed
of
the
that
sprang
from
rock
to
rock
down
the
swift
gorge
at
the
foot
of
which
the
story
house
is
situated
maría
with
her
unbound
tresses
was
no
longer
here
instead
several
boys
snatched
their
garments
as
we
approached
and
sought
quick
shelter
the
pila
was
a
basin
of
sandy
bottom
some
four
feet
deep
and
as
many
times
larger
than
the
less
romantic
bathtub
of
civilization
constantly
renewed
by
the
stream
that
wanders
languidly
away
across
the
valley
of
the
cauca
because
of
the
dip
of
the
garden
the
pila
is
out
of
sight
from
the
house
but
from
his
corner
room
efraín
could
even
as
the
novelist
has
pictured
see
the
girls
as
they
returned
from
their
morning
dip
pausing
to
pick
a
flower
here
and
there
along
the
way
durán
gave
us
leave
to
take
a
plunge
but
though
few
things
would
have
been
more
welcome
after
our
dripping
climb
from
el
cerrito
it
would
have
seemed
something
verging
on
sacrilege
something
like
smoking
a
cigar
with
our
feet
on
juliet
s
balcony
to
have
profaned
with
our
dusty
prosaic
vagabond
forms
the
pool
about
which
seemed
still
to
flit
the
spirit
of
adorable
illustration
the
scene
of
maría
most
famous
of
south
american
novels
and
once
the
residence
of
its
author
it
lies
some
distance
back
from

according

people

colombia

is
little
more
than
the
autobiography
of
its
author
polished
into
the
ideal
in
vogue
a
ago
isaacs
like
the
hero
efraín
was
the
son
of
an
english
jew
born
in
jamaica
who
came
to
colombia
as
a
young
man
married
and
embraced
christianity
like
efraín
the

real
life
the
wife
of
a
doctor
of
popayán
carlos
who
first
offered
his
hand
to

on
his
hacienda

few
miles
out
across
the
valley

said
to
be
still

an
old
old

the

tiger
hunting
the
country
weddings
the
simple
and
patriarchal
household
the
life
and
scenes
of
the
cauca
had
all
been
things
of
reality
deftly
lifted
into
the
realms
of
the
imagination
by
the
even
the
evil
stroke
of
fortune
that
had
befallen
the
family
on
that
dismal
night
in
the
hacienda
of
the
valley
was
no
tale
but
a
stern
fact
that
had
left
the
novelist
without
patrimony
and
brought
into
the
hands
of
strangers
the
house
of
my
we
took
our
leave
in
the
early
afternoon
drifting
down
through
sloping
meadows
past
the
great
black
rock
to
which
maría
used
to
climb
to
watch
for
the
return
of
efraín
from
the
valley
which
here
spreads
out
in
all
its
rich
expanse
majestic
and
silent
to
the
dim
western
cordillera
hays
long
lost
in
meditation
broke
it
at
last
to
announce
that
he
had
found
the
end
of
his
wanderings
that
he
would
return
to
the
zone
to
earn
a
new
stake
and
come
back
to
end
his
days
as
the
owner
of
the
novela
he
was
given
to
catching
such
have
them
die
during
the
succeeding
night
it
was
indeed
the
most
splendid
spot
in
all
the
magnificent
cauca
valley
this
simple
dwelling
set
where
it
could
see
and
be
seen
from
untold
leagues
away
from
the
very
crest
of
the
western
range
yet
never
standing
forth
boldly
and
conspicuously
framed
modestly
among
its
evergreens
just
a
little
way
up
the
first
easy
slope
of
the
andean
range
that
piles
into
the
clouds
behind
it
it
seemed
as
unassuming
and
removed
from
the
hubbub
of
the
modern
world
as
gentle
maría
herself
all
the
day
through
our
eyes
were
drawn
back
to
it
at
frequent
intervals
and
as
long
as
the
light
lasted
it
stood
forth
plainly
in
this
clear
air
though
it
shrunk
to
a
house
in
miniature
then
to
a
mere
speck
on
the
of
the
central
range
all
the
hot
afternoon
we
plodded
onward
some
miles
after
falling
in
with
the
again
we
passed
la
manuelita
the
hacienda
of
the
valley
where
isaacs
father
had
set
up
a
sugar
factory
while
the
son
was
still
a
student
in
bogotá
and
where
took
place
both
in
the
novel
and
real
life
that
pathetic
scene
that
marked
the
ruin
of
the
family
the
estate
is
the
property
of
and
its
products
are
known
throughout
all
colombia
beyond
the
little
amaime
river
the
way
led
through
a
forest
of
bamboo
then
across
a
monotonous
and
dusty
the
great
cordillera
occidental
now
like
a
badly
wrinkled
garment
of
hue
drew
ever
nearer
as
did
a
line
of
trees
marking
the
course
of
the
cauca
river
the
central
range
all
but
faded
away
in
the
east
leaving
a
broad
expanse
of
fertile
country
longing
for
the
plow
further
on
a
broken
bridge
or
two
adorned
a
waterless
stream
and
an
occasional
the
first
thing
on
wheels
we
had
seen
since
crossing
the
magdalena
crawled
by
in
the
sand
the
of
african
slavery
was
everywhere
in
evidence
in
little
cabins
thrown
together
from
jungle
rubbish
lounged
swarms
of
ragged
humanity
black
or
in
color
yet
somehow
they
seemed
less
lazy
than
in
our
own
land
perhaps
because
the
activity
of
their
few
lighter
neighbors
gave
less
contrast
swift
tropical
night
was
spreading
its
cloak
over
all
the
cauca
when
we
sighted
the
sharp
of
palmira
where
we
were
soon
housed
in
the
hotel
in
of
the
day
following
we
broke
out
suddenly
on
the
bank
of
the
cauca
river
a
or
ferry
moored
to
wires
that
sagged
from
shore
to
shore
set
us
across
and
with
sunset
we
plodded
into
cali
our
arrival
was
well
timed
the
chief
commercial
city
of
the
cauca
valley
was
en
fête
from
end
to
end
on
the
sunday
morrow
of
our
entrance
the
place
was
crowded
with
happy
rather
dusky
throngs
and
gay
with
the
chiefly
yellow
flag
of
the
nation
and
the
bishop
s
banner
and
mitre
for
on
that
day
the
ancient
church
of
cali
became
a
cathedral
and
one
of
her
sons
a
bishop
dividing
a
territory
ruled
over
for
centuries
by
the
chief
ecclesiastic
of
popayán
the
name
of
the
hijo
de
cali
about
to
don
the
purple
blazed
forth
from
the
façade
of
the
church
in
enormous
electric
letters
like
that
of
some
broadway
star
and
by
sunset
fully
half
the
visible
population
was
reeling
drunk
in
honor
of
the
honor
that
had
fallen
upon
their
native
town
what
you
don
t
look
for
in
cali
you
won
t
find
runs
a
local
proverb
which
is
a
colombian
way
of
saying
that
its
shops
offer
for
sale
anything
man
may
desire
in
a
small
and
colombian
sense
this
is
true
except
on
those
frequent
occasions
when
the
stock
is
exhausted
connected
with
the
pacific
port
of
buenaventura
by
seven
hours
muleback
and
four
hours
was
hard
to
realize
that
we
were
again
only
four
days
from
a
zone
police
place
is
in
more
or
less
constant
connection
with
the
outside
world
but
the
transportation
facilities
of
the
country
are
so
lax
that
the
merchants
of
cali
are
accustomed
to
announce
the
receipt
of
a
shipment
from
europe
or
america
with
a
sarcastic
placard
por
fin
llegaron
at
last
they
have
arrived
the
city
s
rôle
is
chiefly
that
of
distributing
center
for
the
vast
territory
about
and
behind
it
and
on
the
heels
of
this
first
announcement
appears
on
the
chief
shop
fronts
the
information
of
interest
only
to
arrieros
and
the
owners

a
load
for

or
that
town
of
the
interior
life
in
cali
is
largely
governed
by
placards
as
if
she
had
but
recently
discovered
the
art
of
printing
and
were
making
the
most
of
it
hardly
an
establishment
but
is
adorned
with
its
set
of
rules

away

out
here
in
the
sunset
a
great
colorless
stretch
of
plowed
fields
factories
sooting
the
peerless
cauca
heavens
with
their
strident
industry
there
these
velvety
hillsides
would
be
covered
with
the
gaudy

of

acquisitive

a

ugly
american

broken
and

without

chapter
v
down
the
andes
to
quito
from
cali
a
broad
road
still
fresh
with
early
morning
led
forth
to
the
southeast
skirting
some
foothills
of
the
western
cordillera
really
a
meadow
bounded
by
two
cactus
hedges
and
interwoven
with
an
intricate
network
of
paths
like
the
tracks
of
some
great
railway
terminal
it
was
excellent
for
tramping
birds
sang
merrily
in
the
branches
of
the
scattered
trees

sagged
southward
from
bamboo
pole
to
pole
groups
of
ragged
women
balancing
easily
on
their
heads
a
a
coiled
rope
and
a
rolled
straw
mat
were
already
off
to
gather
cali
s
daily
others
we
met
bearing
likewise
on
their
heads
loads
of
a
large
leaf
that
serves
as
wrapping
paper
in
the
shops
of
the
town
here
passed
a
man
leading
two
on
those
frequent
occasions
when
the
leadership
was
a
haughty
horseman
and
beyond
mule
after
donkey
laden
with
everything
from
milk
to
alfalfa
we
strode
lightly
forward
this
time
for
the
had
been
turned
over
to
a
drummer
from
chicago
bound
to
ecuador
by
sea
before
long
the
character
of
the
country
began
to
change
with
a
promise
of
mountains
to
climb
far
ahead
in
the
hazy
appeared
streams
without
bridges
though
often
with
or
the
trunk
of
a
bamboo
thrown
across
them
grew
frequent
and
the
sky
took
to
muttering
ominously
far
off
to
the
eastward
a
strong
young
river
bright
yellow
in
color
and
flecked
with
spume
sped
by
beneath
the
first
roofed
bridge
with
news
of
last
night
s
storm
somewhere
up
in
the
cordillera
before
the
day
was
done
we
had
several
times
to
strip
to
the
waist
to
ford
torrents
that
had
decorated
themselves
with
leaves
and
flowers
and
the
branches
of
trees
snatched
along
the
way
next
morning
the
foothills
began
to
crowd
in
upon
the
trail
now
a
haphazard
hunted
thing
scurrying
in
and
out
over
and
knolls
and
ever
higher
hills
from
the
tops
of
which
we
several
times
caught
what
we
fancied
was
the
last
view
of
the
great
cauca
valley
behind
us
slowly
the
mountains
themselves
closed
in
we
waded
a
river
toiled
up
a
long
slope
and
came
out
far
above
a
beautiful
little
vale
completely
boxed
in
by
perpendicular
hillsides
only
two
houses
were
to
be
seen
on
its
grassy
floor
spotted
with
scores
of
grazing
cattle
over
it
several
hundred
feet
above
hung
a
broad
column
of
locusts
surely
a
mile
long
moving
slowly
northward
with
a
humming
whirr
that
we
could
plainly
hear
far
beyond
and
shading
the
country
beneath
like
some
enormous
veil
beyond
we
descended
again
to
the
cauca
river
here
there
was
no
ferry
or
rather
it
was
out
of
order
tons
of
merchandise
lay
heaped
along
the
bank
while
cursing
arrieros
chased
their
snorting
mules
into
the
stream
the
negro
who
set
us
across
in
a
long
dugout
collected
five
each
for
the
service
but
this
was
evidently
exorbitant
for
the
woman
of
his
own
color
who
went
with
us
paid
only
four
green
plantains
for
herself
a
piccaninny
and
her
load
luckily
we
had
a
long
draught
of
before
facing
the
notorious
de
on
the
third
day
for
the
stories
we
had
long
heard
of
this
fearsome
climb
had
not
been
exaggerated
high
above
anything
we
had
seen
since
passing
the
quindío
we
came
out
suddenly
on
a
platform
on
the
edge
of
one
of
those
bottomless
ravines
that
abound
in
the
andes
a
mighty
hole
in
the
earth
blue
with
the
very
depths
of
it
just
across
at
the
same
height
hung
in
plain
sight
the
wavering
trail
we
could
only
reach
by
undoing
all
the
climbing
of
days
past
and
doing
it
all
over
again
in
one
single
task
hour
after
hour
we
descended
a
mountainside
so
sheer
that
the
struggle
against
gravity
was
like
a
battle
with
some
hardy
wrestler
only
to
face
at
the
bottom
what
seemed
the
full
unbroken
wall
of
the
andes
the
red
trail
zigzagging
into
the
very
sky
above
all
the
blazing
afternoon
we
climbed
incessantly
to
gain
at
evening
a
height
equal
to
that
of
the
morning
only
a
few
miles
further
south
a
task
that
would
have
seemed
impossible
a
month
earlier
struck
us
now
as
amply
rewarded
by
the
indescribable
panorama
of
mountains
that
spread
away
from
the
summit
in
every
direction
for
once
the
trail
held
for
a
time
the
advantage
it
had
gained
passing
through
buenos
aires
and
morales
towns
of
thick
adobe
walls
though
still
in
the
tropics
we
were
now
in
the
temperate
zone
oaks
abounded
and
the
weather
was
like
that
of
our
northern
states
in
early
autumn
the
population
was
still
dark
in
color
but
negroes
had
faded
away
with
the
architecture
of
the
cauca
for
the
first
time
since
descending
from
the
plateau
of
bogotá
we
met
indians
they
were
of
the
guajiro
tribe
of
color
sturdy
fellows
in
white
garments
reaching
only
to
the
knees
all
male
or
female
young
or
old
greeted
us
in
a
as
we
passed
on
the
last
of
august
four
days
from
cali
we
pushed
more
swiftly
forward
for
we
were
nearing
the
famous
old
city
of
popayán
a
forced
march
dipping
down
through
a
mighty
gully
and
panting
upward
through
swirling
dust
brought
us
at
noon
to
the
dry
and
hilltop
village
of
cajibío
the
population
was
almost
entirely
indian
and
the
dusty
central
square
swarmed
with
the
saturday
market
guajiros
of
both
sexes
and
all
ages
flocked
into
town
from
scores
of
miles
around
sat
with
their
bits
of
produce
under
shelters
or
in
the
open
glare
of
the
equatorial
sun
some
had
already
exchanged
their
wares
for
the
weekly
chicha
debauch
and
staggered
about
maudlin
and
or
lay
tumbled
in
noisome
corners
the
village
priest
the
only
visible
resident
of
european
blood
wandered
in
and
out
among
the
hawkers
with
a
on
the
end
of
a
rod
over
one
shoulder
gazing
away
across
the
sepia
hills
and
distant
blue
ranges
as
if
his
mind
were
utterly
detached
from
this
world
the
padre
paused
before
each
hawker
turned
his
back
and
punched
more
often
the
end
of
the
stick
until
a
contribution
to
the
parochial
larder
had
been
dropped
into
the
sack
the
sun
set
amid
wrapping
itself
in
clouds
in
the
crimsoning
west
and
still
popayán
was
leagues
away
we
plodded
on
into
the
night
there
is
however
a
sort
of
reflected
light
in
these
high
altitudes
where
the
very
mountains
seem
low
hills
a
sense
of
being
of
the
world
with
the
sun
just
out
of
sight
around
the
curve
of
the
earth
fires
evidently
of
indians
burning
off
their
dotted
the
night
on
several
sides
of
us
the
road
grew
broader
and
took
on
that
atrocious
cobbling
which
follows
the
spaniard
everywhere
growing
worse
as
it
approaches
a
town
now
it
stumbled
down
to
a
river
across
a
long
stone
bridge
of
the
massive
type
of
long
ago
and
into
a
village
for
a
time
we
imagined
we
saw
at
last
the
lights
of
the
famous
city
it
was
mere
illusion
not
only
did
we
tramp
another
footsore
hour
but
when
we
did
finally
arrive
there
were
no
lights
the
place
had
grown
up
about
us
in
the
dark
before
we
realized
that
we
were
no
longer
in
the
open
country
the
pedometer
registered
miles
and
our
feet
and
appetites
several
times
that
when
we
halted
undecided
in
what
some
sixth
sense
told
us
was
the
central
plaza
most
famous
of
all
the
cities
from
bogotá
to
quito
boasting
itself
a
cradle
of
savants
long
the
capital
of
a
large
section
of
spain
s
american
colonies
and
still
that
of
the
great
department
of
the
cauca
popayán
had
seemed
to
promise
at
least
the
lesser
comforts
of
civilization
for
days
we
had
slept
on
tables
and
mud
benches
wrapped
in
the
fond
hope
of
making
up
here
for
the
cold
hungry
nights
on
the
trail
we
had
even
feared
there
might
be
difficulty
in
choosing
from
a
plethora
of
accommodations
and
had
gravely
set
down
somewhere
to
the
north
the
name
of
the
hotel
colón
as
of
about
the
grade
of
luxury
fitted
to
our
fortunes
it
was
to
laugh
though
it
was
barely
eight
in
the
evening
popayán
was
as
dead
as
a
graveyard
at
darker
later
we
learned
that
the
famous
city
does
have
lights
few
kerosene
lamps
that
burn
out
within
an
hour
unless
a
puff
of
wind
blows
them
out
first
having
been
a
city
in
the
spanish
sense
only
years
it
was
too
much
to
expect
the
place
to
have
learned
already
of
the
existence
of
electricity
we
hobbled
over
slippery
cobblestones
along
monotonous
streets
and
in
and
out
of
thatched
suburbs
for
what
seemed
hours
before
we
caught
a
man
emerging
from
a
hotel
he
ruminated
as
if
striving
to
recall
a
word
he
had
heard
somewhere
long
ago
you
want
a
hotel
no
you
spiggoty
dolt
growled
hays
in
english
nursing
his
blistered
feet
by
standing
on
one
at
a
time
we
only
asked
that
because
we
wanted
to
know
who
won
the
pennant
this
hotel
went
on
the
musing
unheeding
do
you
come
from
and
where
are
you
going
you
will
be
italianos
alemanes
no
we
re
chinamen
i
snapped
and
looking
for
a
pués
señor
chino
he
replied
cleverly
returning
the
sarcasm
there
is
no
hotel
in
popayán
but
if
you
go
down
this
street
four
in
this
direction
and
three
in
that
and
knock
at
the
door
of
the
second
house
beyond
the
fountain
you
may
find
them
willing
to
give
you
they
were
not
however
nor
were
those
to
whom
they
in
turn
directed
us
a
long
hour
more
we
winced
along
the
uneven
slippery
streets
of
popayán
begging
for
a
bite
to
eat
and
a
plank
to
lie
on
as
in
any
indian
village
only
to
be
turned
away
from
some
of
the
most
distressing
holes
ever
man
offered
to
sleep
in
on
a
wager
but
the
races
have
a
proverb
that
que
anda
hueso
and
we
stumbled
finally
upon
a
in
which
several
young
bloods
of
the
town
were
upholding
their
reputation
as
one
señor
fulano
by
he
was
sober
by
habit
as
were
several
of
his
companions
took
us
in
charge
and
led
the
way
uncertainly
to
a
of
a
room
in
his
ancestral
home
there
my
dreams
of
the
comforts
of
popayán
forever
shattered
i
resigned
myself
to
sleep
once
more
on
a
wooden
table
posing
as
a
bed
hays
was
little
more
fortunate
for
though
he
drew
an
aged
divan
he
fell
asleep
quite
literally
several
times
before
he
abandoned
himself
to
the
floor
which
fate
seemed
bent
on
forcing
him
to
occupy
in
the
morning
fulano
s
garrulous
old
mother
made
more
formal
arrangements
for
our
housing
she
did
not
pretend
to
run
a
she
had
no
hesitancy
in
charging
hotel
she
served
two
greasy
meals
a
day
to
several
clerks
from
the
government
offices
and
out
of
charity
seated
us
with
them
but
alas
however
easily
he
may
spend
the
day
the
leads
a
hard
life
at
night
in
a
huge
and
all
but
empty
front
room
was
an
enormous
bedstead
of
viceregal
days
but
this
too
was
wooden
floored
and
the
diaphanous
that
did
duty
as
mattress
had
had
all
life
crushed
out
of
it
years
before
nor
did
the
single
blanket
have
much
influence
over
the
penetrating
mountain
air
of
early
morning
the
deep
window
embrasures
were
built
with
steps
for
the
use
of
occupants
who
would
engage
in
the
favorite
pastime
of
gazing
out
through
the
reja
but
no
provision
whatever
had
been
made
for
another
convenience
essential
to
all
households
in
this
respect
the
house
was
on
a
par
with
all
the
rest
of
the
famous
city
founded
by
benalcazar
in
the
spanish
sense
of
having
a
scribe
record
under
a
name
bristling
with
reference
to
the
as
usual
failed
to
indian
town
ruled
over
by
a
warlike
named
payán
the
capital
of
the
cauca
has
according
to
its
latest
census
men
and
women
a
disproportion
that
is
reflected
in
its
customs
if
its
own
assertion
is
to
be
taken
at
par
it
is
notable
for
its
fine
climate
and
its
illustrious
of
the
climate
there
can
be
little
criticism
just
how
illustrious
its
sons
might
have
been
in
a
wider
world
no
one
who
has
come
to
see
where
and
how
they
lived
can
be
blamed
for
wondering
of
them
all
the
town
is
evidently
most
proud
of
statue
of
whom
adorns
the
central
savant
who
discovered
how
to
determine
altitude
by
boiling
one
who
has
cooked

long
in
making
the
same
who
taught
the
revolted
colonials
how
to
make
to
be
shot
in
bogotá
for
his
pains
so
aged
is
the
town
that
it
has
not
a
red
roof
left
all
are
faded
to
a
maroon
the
place
bristles
with
ancient
religious
edifices
mementoes
of
its
importance
in
colonial
days
hardly
a
block
is
there
without
its
huge
church
of
cavernous
and
dilapidated
interior
the
silent
little
universidad
del
cauca
of
the
aspect
of
some
bent
and
toothless
old
man
is
famous
now
only
for
its
age
though
in
its
dotage
it
fondly
fancies
itself
still
one
of
the
principal
seats
of
learning
in
the
new
world
over
its
unadorned
main
door
may
still
be
read
a
crumbled
inscription

left
it
uninhabited
but
there
was
evidence
of
practical
training

at

one
respect
beds
of
its
dormitory
were
narrow
wooden
boxes
some
five
feet
long
if
popayán
is
dead
by
night
little
more
can
be
said
for
it
by

languid
shopkeeping

almost
its

seems
to
live
on
what
they
sell
one
another
the
ways
of
its
merchants
are
typical
of
those
in
all
the
somnolent
towns
of
the
andes
with
few
exceptions
they
treat
the
prospective
purchaser
in
a
manner
that
seems
to
say
buy
at
this
price
or
go
away
and
let
me
alone
i
want
to
read
last
week
s
newspaper
finish
my
cigarette
and
and
i
don
t
want
you
here
in
my
store
disturbing
my
too
often
in
the
shops
the
mañana
habit
prevails
that
it
is
always
the
place
that
has
what
you
are
looking
for
the
mortality
of
white
ones
being
high
on
andean
trails
i
entered
a
to
ask
do
you
sell
blue
handkerchiefs
señor
shopkeeper
recovering
from
what
was
really
a
sleep
though
ostensibly
awake
días
señor
cómo
está
usté
cómo
está
la
familia
the
señor
was
it
the
señor
requested
the
chances
always
are
that
he
has
heard
the
question
in
his
dreams
and
if
given
time
will
recall
it
handkerchiefs
is
it
not
señor
blue
handkerchiefs
para
qué
cosa
what
for
for
instance
this
question
which
is
seldom
lacking
being
ignored
the
shopkeeper
turned
to
let
his
eyes
wander
dreamily
over
his
shelves
striving
in
vain
to
bring
his
attention
down
to
the
matter
in
hand
finally
he
took
a
stick
from
a
corner
and
fished
from
an
upper
shelf
a
bundle
opened
it
disclosed
a
pairs
of
faded
red
socks
made
in
germany
but
i
said
shopkeeper
suddenly
but
not
unexpectedly
without
a
pause
between
the
questions
where
do
you
come
from
where
are
you
going
the
traveler
answers
according
to
his
character
and
mood
meanwhile
the
merchant
had
fished
down
a
bundle
of
red
handkerchiefs
i
said
blue
but
this
is
blue
a
beautiful
ultramarine
blue
mira
usté
look
and
he
held
it
up
to
the
reflected
sunlight
that
streamed
in
at
the
only
opening
to
the
shop
doorway
no
señor
i
want
shopkeeper
dreamily
ah
señor
are
none
but
you
can
find
them
to
as
you
are
french
perhaps
señor
here
i
caught
sight
of
a
bundle
of
blue
handkerchiefs
in
plain
view
on
a
lower
shelf
and
pointed
them
out
how
much
shopkeeper
pesos
you
must
take
me
for
a
tourist
or
a
gringo
i
ll
give
you
very
well
señor
muchas
gracias
buenos
días
adiós
or
perhaps
the
stranger
wishes
to
visit
some
local
celebrity
and
pauses
in
a
to
ask
can
you
tell
me
where
medrano
lives
you
mean
medrano
de
pisco
y
miel
is
the
only
medrano
in
town
as
the
merchant
well
knows
but
the
matter
must
be
clothed
in
all
customary
his
house
is
the
second
door
beyond
that
of
enrique
castro
y
pelayo
yes
but
i
am
a
stranger
in
town
and
i
don
t
know
where
don
enrique
you
don
t
know
you
don
t
know
where
enrique
castro
y
pelayo
lives
everyone
knows
the
house
of
enrique
ask
anywhere
they
can
tell
you
to
as
can
tell
this
way
of
life
is
not
without
its
advantages
having
occasion
to
cash
a
traveler
s
check
i
dropped
in
upon
a
native
merchant
who
played
at
being
a
banker
after
the
usual
extended
formalities
he
took
the
check
and
looked
it
over
with
a
puzzled
expression
for
he
knew
no
english
as
a
banker
you
are
of
course
familiar
with
the
system
of
traveler
s
checks
i
put
in
no
señor
i
have
never
before
seen
well
it
is
just
as
good
as
money
and
oh
of
course
he
replied
hastily
since
the
señor
offers
it
how
much
do
you
want
for
it
only
its
face
value
ten
dollars
in
american
i
shall
be
pleased
to
take
it
how
much
is
that
in
our
money
of
the
country
only
a
thousand
pesos
señor
i
replied
disdaining
the
temptation
to
multiply
by
ten
muy
bién
señor
he
replied
and
making
out
an
order
to
his
cashier
for
that
amount
tucked
the
check
away
in
a
drawer
it
is
not
good
unless
i
sign
it
i
suggested
ah
no
he
asked
producing
it
again
for
that
purpose
a
thousand
thanks
pués
adiós
señor
until
we
meet
so
unlimited
is
the
faith
in
ingleses
in
these
regions
that
he
had
no
hesitancy
in
accepting
from
a
stranger
a
check
which
he
would
not
have
dreamed
of
cashing
for
one
of
his
fellow
townsmen
without
ample
proof
of
its
value
one
evening
three
men
in
and
the
manners
of
prime
ministers
dropped
in
upon
us
and
announced
themselves
editors
of
the
newspaper
they
had
only
an
hour
or
two
to
spare
however
and
by
the
time
the
introductory
formalities
were
over
they
bowed
themselves
out
with
the
information
that
they
would
come
and
interview
two
days
later
i
chanced
to
meet
one
of
them
again
did
you
say
sursum
is
published
every
week
i
asked
having
had
no
visual
evidence
of
its
existence
since
our
arrival
oh
yes
indeed
cried
the
editor
rolling
another
cigarette
every
week
is
last
week
it
did
not
appear
it
is
true
and
the
week
before
the
was
and
the
week
before
that
he
was
very
busy
as
his
sister
was
getting
married
but
it
is
sure
to
come
out
next
week
or
if
not
then
the
week
after
and
i
am
myself
coming
to
interview
it
was
in
popayán
that
we
found
leaves
for
sale
for
the
first
time
and
met
indians
whose
cheeks
were
disfigured
by
a
cud
of
them
long
before
the
white
man
appeared
on
his
shores
the
indian
of
the
andes
unacquainted
with
the
tobacco
of
his
north
american
brother
was
addicted
to
this
habit
the
which
is
extracted
the
cocaine
of
modern
plucked
from
a
shrub
not
unlike
the
orange
in
appearance
that
grows
down
in
the
edge
of
the
hot
lands
to
the
east
of
the
andean
chain
once
dried
they
are
packed
in
huge
bales
or
crude
baskets
made
on
the
spot
and
sold
in
the
marketplaces
by
old
women
who
weigh
out
the
desired
amount
in
clumsy
scales
or
in
handfuls
by
eye
measure
the
indians
thrust
the
leaves
one
by
one
into
their
mouths
and
as
they
become
moistened
add
a
bit
of
lime
or
ashes
dipped
with
what
looks
like
an
enlarged
toothpick
from
a
tiny
calabash
which
with
a
leather
pouch
for
the
leaves
themselves
constitutes
the
most
indispensable
article
of
the
aboriginal
equipment
how
harmful
the
habit
may
be
it
is
hard
to
gage
its
devotees
are
it
is
true
languid
of
manner
and
slow
of
intellect
but
they
show
no
great
contrast
in
this
particular
from
the
gente
decente
their
neighbors
who
rarely
indulge
in
the
leaves
except
on
some
long
and
wearisome
journey
so
marked
is
this
languor
in
popayán
that
as
in
most
andean
towns
brawls
are
rare
despite
the
that
reigns
youths
merry
with
liquor
or
its
equivalent
raced
their
horses
up
and
down
the
roughly
cobbled
streets
forcing
them
to
capriole
until
hays
took
to
cursing
his
loss
of
police
powers
street
women
may
few
find
it
their
profession
as
openly
as
vegetable
hawkers
even
when
a
dispute
grows
noisy
there
is
no
interference
a
policeman
may
wander
up
in
curiosity
like
any
other
bystander
but
he
is
almost
sure
to
find
that
the
contender
is
some
authority
or
the
second
cousin
of
the
alcalde
or
a
grandson
of
the
bishop
or
wears
a
white
collar
and
wanders
away
again
lest
he
get
himself
into
trouble
so
we
remained
in
popayán
until
it
had
dwindled
from
the
romantic
city
of
the
past
our
imaginations
had
pictured
to
the
miserable
in
after
years
veiled
by
the
haze
of
memory
its
charm
and
romance
may
one
evening
asked
to
have
our
coffee
served
at
a
reasonable
hour
in
the
morning
siempre
se
van
hoy
cried
our
hostess
when
we
appeared
in
road
garb
next
morning
you
are
really
going
it
was
not
so
much
that
she
was
striving
to
cover
her
failure
to
have
the
coffee
ready
her
mind
could
not
conceive
of
so
definite
a
resolution
outliving
the
night
why
do
you
not
remain
until
and
rest
she
rambled
on
an
hour
later
she
stood
staring
after
us
from
her
doorway
an
act
in
no
way
conspicuous
since
all
that
section
of
popayán
was
similarly
engaged
the
entire
town
had
expressed
its
sympathy
that
we
must
go
all
alone
and
so
trabajoso
over
the
wild
mountains
and
valleys
wherever
we
were
bound
for
not
a
single
popayanejo
took
seriously
our
assertion
that
we
really
hoped
to
reach
ecuador
pasto
was
said
to
be
something
like
a
week
distant
by
land
and
the
route
very
dangerous
though
from
what
source
was
not
clear
for
the
first
lazy
hour
a
good
road
led
gradually
upward
but
like
an
incorrigible
small
boy
getting
out
of
sight
of
home
its
good
behavior
ceased
at
the
hilltop
where
we
caught
the
last
view
of
the
cradle
of
ever
more
winding
and
broken
across
ravines
and
streams
with
bridges
and
without
them
now
and
then
seeming
to
drop
completely
out
of
the
world
about
us
only
to
gather
its
forces
again
far
below
and
scramble
to
even
greater
heights
over
a
saddle
of
a
mountain
wall
beyond
from
the
summit
of
which
the
trail
of
hours
before
stood
forth
as
clearly
as
across
an
alleyway
between
tenement
houses
it
struggled
uncertainly
southward
day
after
day
at
the
hamlet
of
dolores
amid
rugged
and
tumbled
mountains
piled
into
the
sky
on
every
hand
we
came
to
a
parting
of
the
ways
and
had
the
choice
of
continuing
by
the
temperate
or
the
torrid
zone
one
route
went
down
into
the
patía
valley
hotter
than
panama
reputed
the
abode
of
raging
fevers
and
the
of
those
swarms
of
locusts
that
devastate
the
cauca
the
other
by
way
of
los
pueblos
lay
cool
and
high
with
frequent
towns
though
it
was
two
days
longer
and
much
more
broken
and
mountainous
we
chose
the
temperate
zone
the
way
turned
back
for
a
time
almost
the
way
we
had
come
then
climbed
until
a
whole
new
world
opened
out
beyond
towering
peaks
piercing
the
clouds
and
strangely
shaped
masses
of
earth
lying
heaped
up
tumultuously
on
every
hand
for
once
the
trail
showed
unusual
intelligence
in
clinging
to
the
top
of
the
ridge
fighting
its
own
natural
tendency
to
pitch
down
into
the
mighty
valleys
on
either
side
and
the
constant
struggle
of
the
ridge
to
throw
it
off
like
an
bronco
its
rider
we
were
following
now
what
the
colombian
calls
a
a
knife
treading
the
very
edge
of
its
blade
along
it
miserable
mud
huts
were
numerous
and
every
indian
we
met
had
a
cheek
distorted
and
his
teeth
and
lips
discolored
by
a
coca
cud
it
struck
us
as
strange
that
even
bad
habits
have
their
local
habitat
and
that
the
magnificent
mountain
scenery
gave
the
dwellers
no
inspiration
to
better
their
conditions
evidently
the
region
held
foreigners
in
great
fear
as
often
as
we
paused
to
ask
for
lodging
some
transparent
excuse
was
trumped
up
to
get
rid
of
us
the
naïveté
of
the
inhabitants
was
amusing
at
one
village
hut
two
women
met
our
plea
for
posada
with
no
señores
los
maridos
no
están
the
husbands
are
out
we
are
not
interested
in
the
husbands
but
in
a
place
to
yes
but
the
husbands
will
be
out
all
night
and
they
would
make
themselves
very
ugly
se
pondrían
muy
bravos
further
on
my
companion
tried
his
luck
again
two
plump
girls
not
unattractive
in
appearance
bade
him
enter
could
they
give
us
posada
they
thought
so
mother
usually
did
but
she
was
out
just
then
all
right
said
hays
sitting
down
i
ll
wait
for
some
time
had
passed
when
it
occurred
to
him
to
ask
when
will
mother
be
back
oh
perhaps
in
a
week
answered
the
innocent
damsels
she
went
to
mojarras
with
a
load
of
it
was
as
useless
to
try
to
get
a
meal
without
the
loss
of
several
hours
as
to
hope
to
eat
it
without
the
entire
village
squatted
around
us
either
there
was
nothing
to
cook
or
no
pan
to
cook
it
in
until
the
woman
next
door
had
baked
s
or
the
stick
fire
in
the
refused
to
burn
or
some
other
unsurmountable
drawback
developed
hays
constantly
labored
under
the
delusion
that
money
could
expedite
matters
and
was
given
to
drawing
forth
his
worldly
wealth
in
one
wad
to
flourish
it
before
the
languorous
cook
and
incidentally
all
the
gaping
town
the
result
was
often
a
doubled
or
trebled
price
if
not
an
inducement
for
some
of
the
village
louts
to
lay
in
ambush
for
us
somewhere
up
the
trail
but
never
an
earlier
meal
if
they
could
stir
up
their
lethargy
to
serve
us
at
all
it
would
be
only
at
their
own
good
leisure
whatever
the
price
many
a
time
there
occurred
a
scene
similar
to
that
at
san
miguel
hays
shook
a
in
the
face
of
a
bedraggled
indian
woman
who
had
perhaps
never
before
seen
so
large
a
sum
at
one
time
offering
it
all
if
she
would
prepare
a
meal
at
once
she
would
not
but
after
long
argument
served
coffee
and
might
easily
rank
as
a
meal
in
the
collected
a
bill
of
seven
cents
for
days
at
a
time
we
tramped
aguas
the
trails
of
the
andes
are
fond
of
this
means
of
crossing
a
mountain
range
high
above
it
we
caught
the
gorge
of
a
river
and
wound
upstream
in
and
out
along
the
towering
wall
that
shut
us
in
it
was
no
road
of
easy
gradient
such
as
abound
in
the
alps
but
one
that
had
chiefly
built
itself
so
that
all
day
long
we
climbed
and
descended
stony
buttresses
of
the
range
until
they
grew
like
the
constant
nagging
of
a
querulous
old
woman
the
gorge
of
the
brawling
river
ever
far
below
here
and
there
a
hut
and
clearing
hung
on
the
opposite
mountain
wall
or
above
us
in
places
where
plows
were
useless
the
indians
cultivated
their
farms
by
burning
off
a
bit
of
the
swift
slope
threw
a
brush
fence
about
it
dropped
their
seeds
into
carelessly
dug
holes
and
sat
back
to
wait
for
whatever
nature
chose
to
send
them
at
length
in
the
course
of
days
the
trail
having
kept
the
same
general
level
the
diminished
river
rose
to
meet
it
for
hours
more
the
path
jumped
back
and
forth
across
the
ever
smaller
stream
until
this
had
dwindled
to
a
mere
brook
racing
down
a
rocky
gorge
from
its
birthplace
up
under
the
snows
then
when
there
was
nothing
else
left
for
it
the
trail
girded
up
its
loins
and
scrambled
alone
up
out
of
the
valley
and
over
the
backing
range
far
above
i
could
make
out
the
wooden
cross
that
marked
the
summit
masses
of
clouds
scurrying
past
it
as
if
pursued
by
some
enemy
beyond
once
i
passed
a
indian
girl
with
a
baby
on
her
back
who
ran
away
down
an
unmarked
place
in
a
way
to
suggest
that
she
had
taken
me
for
the
fiend
in
person
no
doubt
the
resemblance
was
striking
higher
still
two
or
three
groups
of
the
same
tribe
came
down
at
a
queer
little
the
heavy
loads
on
their
backs
supported
by
a
shawl
knotted
across
their
shoulders
the
plump
breasts
of
the
women
undulating
under
their
dirty
garments
in
we
stood
at
last
on
the
summit
of
the
famous
hanged
so
named
from
some
episode
of
the
conquest
a
indeed
where
the
god
of
the
winds
seemed
to
have
his
chief
warehouse
for
once
the
view
was
entirely
free
from
mist
to
the
east
the
valley
up
which
we
had
come
lay
far
below
twisting
away
to
the
left
to
be
lost
at
last
between
hazy
mountain
chains
there
were
many
more
farmers
here
than
in
the
rich
and
level
cauca
valley
either
because
the
government
is
too
far
distant
to
drive
them
out
by
its
exactions
or
because
the
indian
is
in
his
element
among
these
lofty
ranges
on
every
hand
the
steep
mountain
sides
were
flecked
with
little
farms

away

a

with

pole
attached

demanding

the

decidedly
cold

the

quickly
hence
the
sunshades
but
one
could
not
stand
long
in
so
icy
a
wind
to
admire
even
such
a
scene
a
few
yards
below
the
road
forked
one
branch
stumbling
headlong
down
into
that
chaotic
jumble
of
wooded
hills
and
valleys
the
other
striking
off
through
the
forest
along
the
flank
of
the
range
a
mistake
at
that
height
might
mean
hours
or
even
days
of
extra
toil
we
chose
at
random
and
trusted
to
luck
the
soft
almost
level
road
plunged
away
through
a
dense
green
forest
as
truly
bearded
with
moss
as
any
in
our
north
yet
rich
with
parasites
and
ferns
great
oaks
littered
the
ground
with
acorns
i
drew
ahead
and
marched
on
through
utter
solitude
the
stillness
broken
only
by
the
cold
wind
from
the
south
immense
vistas
of
andes
now
and
then
opening
out
through
a
break
in
the
where
the
forest
began
to
give
way
my
misgivings
were
set
at
rest
by
a
group
of
indians
of
both
sexes
their
mouths
stained
with
plodding
upward
in
single
file
still
maudlin
with
the
that
marked
the
vicinity
of
a
town
all
wore
heavy
felt
hats
and
bore
varying
burdens
the
women
carrying
the
heavier
loads
and
in
addition
a
baby
slung
across
their
breasts
by
a
cloth
knotted
behind
the
neck
not
far
beyond
i
burst
out
suddenly
upon
a
full
view
of
almaguer
almost
directly
below
perched
astride
a
narrow
ridge
between
two
mountains
serene
in
its
precarious
seat
despite
the
raging
wind
that
seemed
constantly
threatening
to
blow
it
off
into
oblivion
then
as
suddenly
it
disappeared
and
i
was
almost
within
the
town
before
i
caught
sight
of
it
again
here
we
caught
one
barbara
diaz
in
the
act
of
feeding
her
swarming
family
and
refused
to
be
driven
away
lodging
however
seemed
unattainable
a
woman
seated
on
her
earth
floor
before
an
american
run
by
hand
carelessly
admitted
that
she
had
a
room
to
rent
before
she
thought
to
say
further
but
on
second
thoughts
she
decided
that
it
would
be
muy
trabajoso
to
prepare
it
for
other
words
very
tiresome
to
get
up
from
the
floor
and
produce
a
key
the
alcalde
was
out
of
town
the
one
woman
who
owned
a
vacant
little
shop
asserted
with
an
air
of
finality
that
her
husband
was
not
at
home
i
turned
to
the
court
of
last
appeal
the
village
priest
he
was
a
but
pleasant
fellow
of
forty
educated
in
the
seminary
of
popayán
occupying
with
a
discreet
but
attractive
young
housekeeper
the
building
in
best
being
the
mud
church
adjoining
his
library
in
latin
and
spanish
with
a
few
volumes
in
french
and
english
was
a
feast
for
the
eyes
in
these
bookless
wilds
during
our
long
chat
the
good
padre
asserted
that
all
the
indians
for
a
hundred
miles
around
were
good
and
faithful
catholics
and
that
almost
all
of
them
could
read
and
write
he
had
long
planned
to
learn
english
but
had
such
a
fearful
lot
of
work
to
do
so
many
masses
to
say
every
day
and
confessions
without
he
took
down
a
book
and
requested
me
to
read
some
english
aloud
just
to
hear
how
it
casually
somewhere
during
the
interview
i
brought
in
a
brief
reference
to
lodging
and
the
padre
forthwith
sent
across
the
plaza
a
small
boy
who
soon
returned
and
led
us
to
the
same
woman
who
had
last
turned
us
away
now
that
the
padre
ordered
she
had
no
hesitancy
in
overlooking
the
absence
of
her
husband
the
lodging
cost
us
nothing
which
was
exactly
what
it
was
worth
it
was
the
usual
mud
cavern
with
a
floor
of
trodden
earth
cold
as
a
dungeon
in
contrast
to
the
blazing
sunshine
outside
and
having
once
been
a
shop
was
all
but
filled
with
a
counter
and
yawning
shelves
curtained
and
draped
with
cobwebs
hays
drew
the
counter
but
i
found
room
to
stow
myself
away
on
one
of
the
higher
shelves
though
with
neither
mattress
nor
covering
and
a
wind
as
off
the
antarctic
ice
sweeping
at
express
speed
across
the
thin
between
two
bottomless
andean
gullies
we
did
not
look
forward
to
darkness
with
pleasure
the
only
water
supply
of
almaguer
attached
to
the
world
only
by
the
royal
highway
at
either
end
was
a
little
wooden
spout
projecting
from
the
hillside
the
had
no
lack
of
aguardiente
however
and
as
to
washing
almaguer
avoids
what
would
otherwise
be
a
difficulty
by
never
having
formed
the
habit
the
making
of
candles
is
its
chief
industry
a
bluish
wax
is
gathered
from
a
laurel
tree
which
abounds
in
the
region
and
even
the
acting
alcalde
spent
the
evening
making
candles
by
dipping
pieces
of
string
again
and
again
into
a
bowl
of
molten
wax
that
worthy
was
also
village
and
purveyor
of
patent
medicines
to
almaguer
a
lank
ungainly
man
in
an
habitual
lack
of
shave
with
a
handkerchief
knotted
about
his
neck
like
a
liverpool
before
the
sun
had
set
he
had
given
us
a
score
of
commissions
chiefly
in
the
patent
medicine
line
to
be
fulfilled
when
we
returned
to
the
then
he
fell
to
talking
of
a
meestare
eddy
sone
and
his
inventions
for
some
time
we
fancied
the
personage
in
question
was
some
local
celebrity
and
not
until
the
had
turned
the
conversation
to
a
meestare
frunk
lean
who
was
also
it
seemed
a
great
gringo
electrician
and
answered
to
the
surname
of
benjamin
did
we
catch
the
drift
of
his
monologue
he
had
brought
up
the
subject
it
turned
out
because
he
had
long
been
curious
to
know
whether
the
meestares
frunk
lean
and
eddy
sone
often
met
to
plan
their
work
together
or
whether
as
so
often
happened
among
the
great
men
of
almaguer
they
were
unfortunately
rivals
and
enemies
it
is
always
a
long
time
night
in
this
andean
land
of
no
lights
and
little
covering
the
evenings
seem
interminable
small
wonder
the
inhabitants
are
ignorant
and
when
they
can
only
sit
and
gossip
after
the
sun
goes
down
the
traveler
eats
it
is
to
be
a
walk
talks
awhile
with
some
he
is
gifted
with
the
medieval
art
of
home
sits
around
awhile
on
the
earth
floor
or
an
adobe
block
thinks
over
his
past
history
and
future
he
smoked
and
finally
deciding
to
go
to
bed
looks
at
his
tin
watch
to
find
it
is
almost
seven
in
almaguer
there
were
none
of
these
drawbacks
for
as
i
lay
abed
my
upper
laurel
candle
gave
sufficient
flicker
by
which
to
make
out
the
dimly
printed
pages
of
a
bogotá
long
as
i
kept
wide
enough
awake
to
balance
the
candlestick
on
my
forehead
it
is
not
far
from
almaguer
to
its
twin
city
of
bolívar
yet
they
are
far
apart
on
the
map
one
could
stroll
over
in
an
hour
or
two
pausing
for
a
nap
on
the
way
so
could
one
in
real
life
but
for
a
single
drawback
lack
of
a
bridge
both
towns
the
largest
between
popayán
and
pasto
lie
at
about
the
same
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
but
between
them
is
a
gash
in
the
earth
which
does
not
reach
to
the
infernal
regions
simply
and
only
because
these
are
not
situated
where
some
fancied
them
for
days
now
there
had
been
persistent
rumors
of
highway
robbers
reputed
experts
in
the
art
of
shooting
travelers
in
the
back
from
any
of
the
countless
along
the
trail
every
town
in
turn
asserted
that
its
own
region
was
eminently
safe
the
danger
was
always
in
the
next
one
each
traveler
we
they
were
never
a
rifle
or
a
musket
once
at
an
awkward
defile
we
suddenly
caught
sight
of
an
group
of
ruffians
on
a
knoll
above
and
our
back
muscles
twitched
reflexively
until
we
had
climbed
out
of
range
the
fact
that
our
own
weapons
hung
in
plain
sight
may
have
been
the
cause
of
their
inaction
again
in
san
lorenzo
of
especially
evil
repute
several
fellows
showed
great
interest
in
our
movements
when
we
took
the
opportunity
to
oil
our
and
demonstrate
their
quick
action
however
the
group
assured
us
that
the
robbers
never
troubled
foreigners
and
faded
gradually
away
the
danger
if
it
existed
was
multiplied
by
the
fact
that
we
were
forced
to
canvass
the
town
until
we
had
changed
our
money
into
silver
we
were
about
to
enter
the
department
of
nariño
southernmost
of
colombia
where
the
paper
bills
of
the
central
government
have
never
been
accepted
yet
the
department
has
no
money
of
its
own
silver
coins
of
whatever
origin
have
a
fixed
worth
according
to
size
rather
than
face
value
those
with
holes
in
them
losing
nothing
thereby
pieces
of
the
weight
of
our
silver
dollar
were
known
as
and
valued
at
cents
our
quarter
or
an
english
shilling
was
accepted
as
dos
reales
cents
among
the
hodgepodge
of
coins
that
came
into
my
possession
was
a
piece
of
old
spain
dated
under
the
profile
of
charles
iv
the
shopkeeper
with
whom
i
spent
it
valued
it
at
two
because
it
was
somewhat
smaller
than
the
piece
but
after
an
argument
accepted
it
as
four
the
twenty
dollars
we
each
gathered
made
a
sackful
nearly
as
heavy
as
all
the
rest
of
our
baggage
the
landscape
too
had
changed
instead
of
the
hot
dry
repulsive
ranges
behind
we
were
again
in
woods
and
fields
the
trail
climbing
from
valleys
where
ran
cold
mountain
streams
so
clear
we
could
not
see
the
water
but
only
the
bottom
of
the
bed
to
oaken
heights
in
places
there
were
slight
outcroppings
of
coal
then
a
road
for
hours
up
a
mountainside
now
and
then
when
we
were
ready
to
drop
from
exhaustion
bringing
us
out
on
a
little
level
space
like
a
landing
on
an
endless
stairway
then
scrambling
on
up
still
steeper
heights
when
at
last
we
stood
on
the
of
the
cuchillo
de
bateros
dividing
autonomous
nariño
from
the
rest
of
colombia
bolívar
two
days
behind
lay
as
plainly
in
sight
as
a
house
across
the
street
the
immense
peak
beside
it
sunk
to
an
insignificant
knoll
to
the
west
we
could
look
down
into
the
misty
valley
of
the
wonder
whether
we
would
not
have
done
better
to
have
taken
its
more
level
route

all
its
fevers

south

at
dusk
we
came
out
on
a
headland
and
saw
so
directly
below
that
a
false
step
would
have
pitched
us
or
rather
our
mangled
remains
down
into
its
very
plaza
the
mathematically
regular
town

rich
meadows

east

west
to

rocky

so
steep

we
could
only
hold
our
own
by

our
toes
into
the
shale

keeping
our
taut
as
so
swift
that
the
trail
often
split
to
bits
from
its

momentum

were
startled
to

first
boy

met

that

own

a
room
to
rent

laid
aside
the
hat
he
was
weaving
and
picking
up
a
bunch
of
enormous
keys
stepped
toward
an
adobe
building
across
the
street
but
at
that
moment
a
patched
and
barefoot
man
rushed
down
upon
us
likewise
offering
us
posada
in
a
startling
burst
of
eloquence
for
a
time
it
looked
as
if
for
once
instead
of
having
to
fight
for
lodgings
lodgings
were
going
to
fight
for

settled
the
dispute

the
simple
expedient

asking

his
price

the
boy
defiantly
in
my

the
man
haughtily
it
will
cost
you
nothing
moreover
foreigners
always
lodge
behind
his
bravado
he
seemed
so
nearly
on
the
point
of
weeping
that
we
should
no
doubt
have
chosen
his
office
of
barbering
even
had
there
been
no
such
gulf
between
the
rival
prices

thanked
us
for
the
favor

from
somewhere
about
his
person
an
enormous
key
unlocked
one
of
those
unruly
indigenous
to
rural
south

which
projected
a
shingle

on
one
side

that
we
were
about
to

remember
that
the
sending
to
you
of
the
system
for
a
mere
is
only
a
special
offer
that
we
make
and
if
you
wish
to
have
the
privilege
of
being
the
first
in
your
locality
to
possess
these
great
secrets
you
ought
to
send
this
very
day
without
further
particulars
i
take
great
pleasure
in
signing
myself
your
grateful
and
affectionate
servant
signed
victor
segno
president
per
sec
dictated
to
no
there
was
no
doubt
that
santiago
had
followed
the
injunction
to
read
the
pamphlet
letter
by
letter
thanks
to
his
colombian
schooling
that
was
the
only
way
he
could
read
it
but
how
was
he
to
send
the
mere
to
inspiration
point
without
his
knowing
it
and
perhaps
forestalling
his
opportunity
to
be
the
first
in
his
locality
to
possess
the
powerful
secret
there
is
no
system
between
colombia
and
the
united
states
he
dared
not
send
the
cash
even
if
so
large
an
amount
of
nariño
silver
could
be
enclosed
in
a
parcel
the
post
would
carry
so
he
had
hidden
the
letter
away
and
lain
in
wait
for
the
rare
foreigners
that
drift
into
san
pablo
while
we
read
it
he
sat
on
one
of
our
beds
nervously
fingering
his
toes
when
we
had
finished
he
begged
us
to
find
some
way
of
sending
the
money
imploring
us
on
our
hopes
of
eternity
not
to
whisper
a
word
of
the
secret
to
his
we
promised
to
think
the
matter
over
when
are
you
going
to
open
the
shop
this
morning
asked
hays
as
our
host
turned
toward
the
door
oh
i
shall
not
trouble
to
open
said
the
barber
in
a
weary
voice
and
wandered
away
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
sees
no
need
of
common
toil
when
he
is
on
the
point
of
becoming
the
dictator
of
fate
in
all
his
locality
we
hatched
a
scheme
against
his
return
if
we
fancied
he
might
forget
the
matter
we
were
deceived
nothing
else
seemed
to
be
weighing
on
his
mind
when
he
turned
up
again
in
the
evening
dejected
and
worried
to
have
tried
to
explain
the
truth
to
him
would
have
been
only
to
convince
him
that
we
were
agents
of
some
rival
house
sent
down
here
purposely
to
ruin
his
chances
of
imposing
his
will
upon
san
pablo
if
you
feel
you
must
have
this
system
i
began
i
ll
tell
you
what
i
ll
do
i
have
some
money
in
a
bank
in
the
estados
unidos
and
i
will
give
you
a
personal
check
for
that
you
can
mail
to
the
chirological
magnífico
cried
the
barber
instantly
transformed
from
the
depths
of
gloom
to
the
summits
of
glee
a
thousand
thanks
that
will
be
in
billetes
of
colombia
i
will
get
it
at
once
it
will
be
simpler
i
suggested
to
wait
until
you
hear
the
check
has
arrived
then
send
it
to
me
naturally
i
am
running
no
risk
in
trusting
one
of
the
chief
men
of
san
pablo
anyway
it
would
only
be
in
payment
for
our
magnificent
the
colombian
rarely
needs
much
urging
to
accept
a
favor
and
his
formal
protests
soon
died
away
i
sat
down
to
write
the
check
the
fake
bank

to
the
order
of
the

baron
münchausen
the
barber
carefully
folded
the
valuable
document
and
hid
it
away
in
his
garments
promising
to
send
it
at
the
first
a
plain
envelope
unregistered
for
he
explained
confiding
to
us
a
secret
the
officials
always
steal
any
letter
they
think
has
money
in
it
and
to
register
it
makes
them
sure
it
the
plan
was
cruel
but
we
could
think
of
no
other
no
doubt
santiago
waited
many
anxious
months
for
the
arrival
of
the
system
certainly
no
longer
than
he
would
have
if
he
had
managed
to
send
real
money
meanwhile
as
enthusiasm
shrinks
rapidly
it
may
be
that
he
grew
resigned
to
his
failure
to
become
the
dictator
of
san
pablo
and
took
up
again
the
shaving
of
its
swarthy
faces
and
the
cutting
of
its
coarse
black
hair
every
house
of
san

of

left
to
itself
the

at

blossoms
or

out
in
the

of
a
fern
once
it
has
reached
this
stage
it
is
no
longer
useful
to
the
weaver
of
hats
for
his
purposes
the
leaves
must
be
nipped
in
the
bud
so
to
speak
while
still
in
the
stalk
the
green
layers
that
would
but
for
this
premature
end
have
expanded
later

between
the

of
a

is
no

whatever
except
in
the
width
of
the

boiled
and
laid
out
in
the

these
curl
tightly
together
they
are
then
bleached
white
in
a
sulphur
oven
and
sold
to
the

not

also
a

not
only
coarse

placed

then
just

the
wholesale

about
a

a

virtually
every
inhabitant
of
san
pablo
is
from
childhood
an
expert
weaver
of
hats
we
had
only
to
glance
in
at
a
door
to
be
almost
sure
to
find
the
entire
family
large
and
small
so
engaged
they
squatted
on
their
earth
floors
leaned
in
their
doorways
wandered
the
streets
incessantly
weaving
hats
they
gossiped
and
quarreled
they
grew
vociferous
in
political
discussion
and
still
they
went
on
weaving
they
shouted
across
the
plaza
to
the
two
meestares
that
were
the
guests
of
santiago
the
barber
a
in
one
single
flow
of
words
without
a
pause
for
breath
but
their
fingers
continued
to
weave
hats
as
steadily
as
if
they
were
automatic
contrivances
we
were
told
that
in
all
the
history
of
the
town
only
one
boy
had
been
too
stupid
to
learn
to
weave
he
was
now
the
priest
of
a
neighboring
hamlet
some
make
a
regular
business
of
it
and
weave
several
hats
a
week
as
many
as
one
común
a
day
only
the
rare
victim
of
an
artistic
temperament
prides
himself
on
putting
his
best
efforts
and
from
two
weeks
to
a
month
of
work
into
an
article
of
fine
weave
to
receive
a
small
fortune
of
eight
or
ten
dollars
in
one
windfall
it
is
in
keeping
with
character
that
only
a
very
few
choose
this
extended
effort
instead
of
the
short
task
of
weaving
the
government
telegraph
operator
of

probably
averages
a
dozen
messages

record
of
one
hat

six
hats
a

the
year
round
that
was
probably
at
least
double
the
average
output
for
very
few
worked
with
any
such
marked
industry
the
overwhelming
majority
are
amateur
weavers
making
one
hat
a
week
merely
as
an
avocation
in
the
interstices
of
their
more
regular
occupations
of
cooking

shopkeeping
and

had
they

result
is
that
the

can
almost
tell
the
day

by
the
stage
of
development
of
the
hats
he
meets
along
the
route
the
center
of
the
nariño
hat
industry
is
pasto
not
that
its
inhabitants
are
weavers
but
here
orders
are
received
from
the
outside

and
distributed
among
the
towns
of
the

thus
jesús

finds
its
market
in
habana
the
weavers
of
san
pablo
can
seldom
be
induced
to
make
the
hats
for
women
since
these
can
be
sold
only
in
the
united
states
and
the
market
is
very
uncertain
because
there
a
woman
confided
to
us
the
style
is
always
changing
as
if
they
do
not
know
their
own
unless
they
can
be
sold
in
our
own
land
these
hats
are
worthless
for
the
women

only
what
we
would
consider
men

those
worn
in

his

so
carelessly

for
one
hat
costs
from
one
to
forty
cents
depending
on
the
fineness
the
high
price
of

is
chiefly
due
to
the
long
labor
involved
in

the

in

with

none

admitted

won

the

us
clattering
away
down
the
of
san

the
gigantic
key
protruding
from
its

until
santiago
the
barber
saw
fit
to
awake
from
his
dreams
of
future
glory
at
the
top
of
a
range
beyond
we
met
the
first
horsemen
in
winter
garments
and
heavy
ruanas
of
army
blue
on
the
further
slope

the
rich
uplands
beyond

were
many
indian
hamlets

thatched
house
in
a
little
field
of
its
own
the
grain
of
our
homeland
the
almost
forgotten
wheat
began
to
appear
in
patches
on
the
hillsides
with
little
fenced
of
trodden
earth
round
and
round
which
the
peasants
chased
their
unharnessed
horses
every
family
had
its
patch
of
wheat
corn
or
potatoes
according
to
the
altitude
among
the
latter
were
many
species
unfamiliar
to
us

some
with

whole
acres
of

we
were
nearing

the

drew
us
swiftly
on
as

and

trails
and
the
afternoon
was
still
young
when
we
halted
at
san

miles
from
the
barber
s
door
here
it
made
much
cold
and
we
were
warned
that
it
would
make
even
more
so
in

native
information
on
this
point
is
seldom
of
much

to

in

climate

not

by
location
or
altitude

very
few
of

have
any
notion
why
one
town
differs
in
temperature
from
another

all

fixed
climate

they
consider

of
atrocious
heat
a
neighboring
hamlet
where
the
mercury
really
falls
but
a
few
degrees

or
rises
a

they
accept
the
variation
with
the
same
passive
indifference
that
governs
their
lives
from
mother

back
to
the

their
catholic

stifling
the
query
the
fact
remains
the
sabe

it
was
september
thirteenth
the
first
anniversary
of
the
beginning
of
my
journey
when
we
swung
on
our
packs
again
in
spite
of
our
resolutions
the
proximity
of
a
city
had
the
usual
effect
of
increasing
our
ordinarily
leisurely
gait
sunrise
overtook
us
striding
down
the
great
san
bernardo
valley
a
vast
gorge
cultivated
far
up
the
mountain
sides
sugarcane
mottled
the
landscape
here
and
there
with
its
every
hut
had
its
a
crude
crusher
with
wooden
rollers
operated
by
oxen
or
a
still
cruder
one
run
by
hand
bananas
were
plentiful
oranges
lay
rotting
in
thousands
along
the
way
as
the
sun
rose
higher
the
pastuso
arrieros
and
horsemen
threw
the
sides
of
their
ruanas
back
over
their
shoulders
disclosing
the
bright
red
linings
once
it
had
crossed
the
river
at
the
bottom
of
the
valley
the
it
was
a
real
road
now
speaking
well
of
the
industry
of
nariño
round
and
round
the
toothlike
flanks
of
the
mountain
wall
rising
ever
higher
for
many
miles
yet
so
gradually
that
we
were
scarcely
conscious
of
climbing
here
at
last
we
found
ourselves
in
the
andes
as
the
imagination
had
pictured
them
mammoth
treeless
repulsive
wholly
infertile
mountains
piled
irregularly
into
the
blue
heavens
on
every
hand
under
our
feet
the
road
suddenly
began
a
buck
and
wing
shuffle
and
leaving
it
to
its
vagaries
we
scrambled
and
hays
in
his
toward
the
juanambú
river
to
the
pass
where
general
nariño
fought
one
of
the
great
battles
of
the
war
of
independence
two
hours
beyond
we
came
out
on
the
nose
of
a
cliff
with
a
sheer
fall
of
thousands
of
we
took
care
not
to
a
view
of
the
country
we
had
crossed
for
days
past
the
trail
of
hours
before
climbing
away
into
the
sky
at
what
seemed
but
a
rifle
shot
away
at
boesaco
a
woman
agreed
to
prepare
food
if
i
would
give
her
an
advance
sufficient
to
buy
the
necessary
ingredients
when
hays
arrived
we
sat
down
to
a
dinner
so
plentiful
that
we
rose
again
with
difficulty
life
is
like
that
in
the
andes
the
traveler
must
feed
to
bursting
when
the
opportunity
offers
and
starve
at
times
without
complaint
we
had
already
done
a
reasonable
day
s
tramping
but
the
nearness
of
pasto
overcame
our
better
judgment
a
few
miles
out
a
group
of
pastusos
of
almost
full
caucasian
blood
rode
by
me
with
silent
disdain
evidently
they
disapproved
of
our
mode
of
travel
just
beyond
the
road
broke
up
into
many
faint
paths
across
a
meadow
the
stony
old
trail
of
colonial
days
toiling
up
the
face
of
the
mountain
to
the
right
i
drew
an
arrow
in
the
sand
lest
hays
lost
in
some
reverie
should
fail
to
note
the
shod
feet
by
which
we
tracked
each
other
so
easily
in
a
world
where
all
who
walk
go
barefoot
a
mile
or
two
across
the
meadow
i
fell
in
with
an
excellent
new
highway
well
engineered
that
took
to
scolloping
in
and
out
along
the
flank
of
an
enormous
range
with
a
steady
rise
that
never
for
an
instant
ceased
as
long
as
the
day
lasted
here
and
there
a
clear
cold
stream
trickled
from
the
still
unhealed
mountainside
piled
into
the
sky
above
me
the
visible
world
was
wholly
uninhabited
now
with
cold
bleak
winds
sweeping
across
the
vast
panorama
of
ranges
below
and
above
while
ahead
great
patches
of
mist
the
dense
bearded
forests
through
which
the
road
climbed
doggedly
in
these
solitary
berruecos
ranges
general
sucre
was
but
one
of
many
who
had
been
murdered
by
brigands
or
conspirators
and
every
turn
of
the
lonely
road
offered
splendid
ambush
indeed
it
seemed
strange
that
colombia
had
proved
so
free
from
highway
violence
with
no
other
policing
outside
the
capital
than
in
the
larger
villages
an
occasional
youth
in
one
piece
of
uniform
carrying
a
or
a
toward
nightfall
a
horseman
overtook
me
six
weeks
on
the
road
had
left
me
in
excellent
condition
and
in
spite
of
the
miles
in
my
legs
his
animal
could
barely
hold
my
pace
for
a
long
time
we
mounted
almost
side
by
side
a
new
stretch
of
solitary
highway
staring
us
in
the
face
at
every
turn
cold
night
settling
down
in
utter
solitude
it
had
grown
wholly
dark
when
we
reached
the
summit
damp
with
the
breath
of
the
forest
an
arctic
wind
sweeping
across
it
with
dense
black
night
and
a
suggestion
of
vast
mountain
depths
on
all
sides
the
silent
gloomy
pastuso
was
evidently
suspicious
of
my
intentions
and
refused
to
ride
ahead
nor
was
i
too
sure
of
him
the
dislike
of
having
an
unknown
traveler
behind
me
had
persisted
since
my
tramp
through
mexico
but
there
was
no
other
choice
than
to
take
the
lead
on
the
further
side
the
road
was
poorer
with
a
sharp
grade
and
hundreds
of
fine
chances
to
sprain
an
ankle
colombians
do
not
travel
by
night
when
they
can
avoid
it
and
we
met
not
a
sign
of
life
the
stony
road
descended
so
swiftly
that
i
had
difficulty
in
judging
its
pitch
and
a
constant
struggle
to
keep
from
falling
on
my
face
suddenly
at
a
chaos
of
paths
rocks
and
jagged
holes
as
of
some
earthquake
i
cross
an
unseen
but
noisy
stream
by
a
sagging
log
and
leaving
the
cautious
horseman
behind
saw
him
no
more
on
and
on
the
rough
and
broken
world
dropped
before
me
with
never
a
moment
of
respite
for
my
aching
thighs
i
was
concluding
i
had
lost
the
way
entirely
when
suddenly
there
burst
upon
me
all
the
electric
lights
of
electric
lights
of
them
as
i
could
count
from
my
point
of
vantage
each
of
what
would
have
been
sixteen
had
each
had
some
fourteen
candles
to
help
out
i
slipped
on
my
coat
in
anticipation
of
entering
a
hotbed
of
civilization
for
was
not
pasto
the
largest
city
between
bogotá
and
quito
i
have
ever
been
a
city
it
was
to
be
sure
in
the
south
american
sense
but
travelers
other
than
those
of
the
class
come
rarely
to
pasto
and
those
who
do
arrive
decorously
by
day
and
seek
the
homes
of
friends
i
had
been
given
the
name
of
the
hotel
the
first
passerby
directed
me
to
it
but
added
the
information
that
they
no
longer
assisted
that
is
gave
meals
but
they
have
rooms
no
they
never
did
have
rooms
they
were
only
a
words
have
strange
meanings
in
the
far
interior
of
south
america
all
that
was
left
me
was
the
posada
an
ancient
dark
and
gloomy
building
around
a
patio
full
of
the
scent
and
noises
of
mules
and
horses
and
of
arrieros
wrapped
in
their
blankets
even
the
corner
policeman
advised
me
to
keep
the
room
offered
me
and
be
thankful
it
was
fortunate
that
hays
had
not
arrived
for
both
of
us
could
scarcely
have
crowded
into
the
damp
dungeon
to
say
nothing
of
occupying
the
plank
evidently
he
had
found
lodging
somewhere
along
the
way
during
the
day
i
had
laid
miles
behind
me
yet
so
fresh
had
i
arrived
that
i
went
out
for
a
stroll
before
retiring
to
pass
a
night
almost
as
cold
as
in
bogotá
dressed
in
every
rag
i
owned
with
two
adobe
bricks
as
pillow
and
as
covering
against
the
bitter
cold
that
crept
in
even
through
the
closed
privilege
of
hugging
myself
i
had
taken
my
coffee
and
wandered
the
streets
of
pasto
for
an
hour
next
morning
when
i
suddenly
sighted
hays
accompanied
by
a
native
usually
as
immaculate
as
conditions
permitted
he
was
now
unwashed
unshaven
bedraggled
drawn
of
features
and
generally
disreputable
with
a
sheepish
look
that
turned
to
relief
at
sight
of
me
he
had
a
sad
story
to
tell
lost
in
some
dream
he
had
overlooked
my
arrow
in
the
sand
and
taken
the
old
stony
road
over
the
berruecos
range
it
was
a
shorter
route
in
miles
and
had
the
doubtful
advantage
of
leading
him
past
the
very
spot
at
which
sucre
was
assassinated
but
the
now
abandoned
trail
of
colonial
days
was
in
such
a
condition
that
he
had
several
times
come
near
breaking
a
leg
if
not
his
neck
limping
at
last
into
town
late
at
night
he
had
wandered
the
streets
for
some
time
in
vain
when
two
natives
asked
if
he
was
looking
for
lodging
congratulating
himself
on
his
good
fortune
he
fell
into
step
with
them
a
square
or
two
further
on
one
of
the
pair
disclosed
a
policeman
s
hanging
from
his
arm
hays
excused
himself
and
turned
away
only
to
be
halted
with
the
information
that
the
law
of
pasto
required
that
any
stranger
arriving
after
eight
at
night
be
taken
to
the
police
station
the
of
the
zone
accustomed
for
years
to
order
his
subordinates
to
lock
up
other
men
was
appalled
at
the
notion
of
being
himself
locked
up
his
affronted
dignity
favored
the
pair
with
some
of
the
most
expressive
castilian
to
be
found
within
the
covers
of
ramsey
all
in
vain
at
the
station
the
lieutenant
who
rose
from
a
troubled
sleep
with
a
towel
around
his
head
was
courtesy
itself
explaining
that
pasto
would
not
dream
of
subjecting
so
distinguished
a
foreigner
to
arrest
but
as
the
night
was
late
and
the
streets
cold
they
were
doing
him
the
favor
of
lodging
him
not
in
jail
but
in
the
police
barracks
looked
at
in
that
light
and
at
that
hour
the
affair
assumed
a
new
aspect
hays
voiced
his
thanks
and
slipped
from
under
his
pack
a
policeman
led
him
to
the
squad
room
gave
him
a
reed
mat
to
spread
on
the
floor
beside
the
score
already
asleep
and
covered
him
with
one
of
the
red
and
blue
ruanas
of
pasto
on
such
terms
i
would
gladly
have
spent
the
night
under
arrest
myself
at
midnight
there
had
rushed
into
the
room
all
the
policemen
on
duty
in
town
each
dragged
his
relief
to
his
feet
and
at
once
dived
into
the
vacated
bed
leaving
pasto
for
a
at
the
mercy
of
the
lawless
at
dawn
the
order
to
muster
was
sounded
the
policemen
each
and
all
turned
over
for
another
nap
and
only
rose
when
the
querulous
little
chief
of
police
came
to
give
the
order
in
person
even
then
after
considerable
argument
hays
had
started
to
take
his
leave
but
was
called
back
to
give
his
pedigree
the
government
paper
was
in
my
hands
the
chief
apologized
for
the
necessity
but
put
him
in
charge
of
the
detective
until
he
could
examine
the
document
in
question
we
planned
to
spend
several
days
in
pasto
but
our
efforts
to
get
better
lodgings
did
not
meet
with
rosy
success
we
were
once
even
on
the
point
of
renting
a
house
on
a
corner
of
the
to
find
that
though
it
had
room
enough
to
accommodate
a
score
of
persons
it
was
furnished
simply
and
exclusively
with
the
bedsteads
indigenous
to
the
andes
meanwhile
the
bridal
chamber
of
the
posada
was
vacated

there
were

a

descent
to

and
the

hence
we
saw
in
the
streets
of
pasto
not
merely
the
now
familiar
civilized
indian
of
the
highlands
plodding
behind
his
no
more
stolid
bulls
laden
with
the
produce
of
his
chacras
but
also
no
small
number
of
wild
men
from
the
wilderness
these
have
a
free
happy
independent
air
in
marked
contrast
to
the
manner
of
the
dismal
mountain
indian
none
of
the
cautious
laborious
canny
attitude
toward
life
of
those
subject
to
the
environment
of
high
altitudes
they
appear
to
hold
the
domesticated
indian
in
great
scorn
and
mix
far
more
freely
with
the
other
classes
of
the
population
dressed
in
what
could
easily
be
mistaken
for
the
running
pants
of
an
athlete
their
marvelously
developed
bronzed
legs
are
bare
in
any

a
light
ruana
covers

most
of

only
their
matted
thick
black
hair
cut
short
across
the
neck
in

fashion

were
always
several
women
in
each
group

must
look
sharply
to
make
sure
of
the
sex
dressed
identically
like

male
companions

we
took
leave
of

four
days
after
our
arrival
that
having
his
usual
luck
in
winning
the
single
wooden
slept
on
a
hairy
cowhide
on
the
earth
floor
of
an
indian
hut
beside
the
ancasmayu
or
blue
river
about
the
northern
limit
of
the
inca
empire
at
its
height
and
all
night
long
kept
running
over
me
squeaking
their
incessant
treble
grunt
gnawing
at
anything
that
seemed
edible
besides
the
llama
and
perhaps
the
a
mute
dog
that
is
said
to
have
been
exterminated
by
the
hungry
conquistadores
the
only
domestic
animal
of
the
andes
at
the
time
of
the
conquest
were
these
lively
little
rodents
so
absurdly
misnamed
in
english
since
they
are
neither
of
the
porcine
family
nor
known
in
guinea
being
indigenous
to
south
america
the
spaniards
more
reasonably
called
them
de
rabbits
of
to
the
natives
they
were
and
still
are
known
as
kwee
the
origin
of
which
term
is
evident
to
anyone
who
has
listened
to
their
grunting
squeak
through
an
endless
andean
night
in
llama
being
too
valuable
an
animal
to
eat
even
had
the
herds
not
been
the
personal
property
of
the
cui
probably
constituted
the
only
meat
except
wild
game
of
the
indian
s
scanty
diet
every
hut
in
the
andean
highlands
is
overrun
by
them
the
gente
decente
facetiously
assert
that
the
indians
keep
them
for
two
purposes
eat
and
as
a
means
of
learning
the
art
of
multiplication
next
day
the
road
was
all
but
impassable
or
we
should
have
reached
ipiales
on
the
frontier
that
evening
not
that
it
was
a
bad
road
as
roads
go
in
the
andes
but
rain
had
fallen
most
of
the
night
and
we
skated
down
each
slope
in
constant
expectation
of
a
to
claw
our
way
almost
on
hands
and
knees
to
the
succeeding
summit
once
we
tobogganed
thousands
of
feet
clear
through
a
town
in
which
we
had
planned
to
eat
literally
unable
to
stop
until
we
brought
up
against
a
luckily
placed
boulder
on
the
edge
of
a
stream
in
a
roaring
gorge
far
below
at
iles
where
hays
hurrying
on
in
quest
of
cigarettes
which
he
detested
only
next
to
smokelessness
for
once
arrived
before
me
i
found
dinner
already
preparing
and
my
companion
burdened
with
the
key
to
a
lodging
a
tinsmith
had
left
off
work
for
the
afternoon
that
we
might
have
undisputed
possession
of
his
shop
stocked
with
a
few
ordinary
articles
of
tinware
but
given
over
chiefly
to
the
fabrication
of
tin
saints
strange
to
say
once
they
had
been
sanctified
by
the
priest
the
results
of
his
labors
were
as
sacred
to
the
tinsmith
as
to
his
iles
was
just
finishing
a
huge
new
church
the
only
implements
of
the
workmen
were
shovels
for
the
whole
building
was
of
native
mud
even
to
the
the
entire
indian
population
male
and
female
impressed
into
service
by
the
padre
trotted
in
constant
procession
from
the
spot
where
the
clay
was
mixed
with
mountain
grass
and
trampled
with
bare
feet
carrying
on
their
heads
tiles
filled
with
the
material
the
women
bearing
also
their
babies
slung
on
their
backs
the
free
labor
system
of
the
incas
inherited
by
the
conquistadores
is
still
in
vogue
in
the
isolated
towns
of
the
andes
the
taskmaster
of
being
the
village
cura
as
we
neared
the
frontier
population
grew
less
and
less
frequent
and
there
were
long
stretches
without
an
inhabitant
in
the
afternoon
we
turned
aside
from
the
royal
highway
to
visit
the
virgen
de
las
lajas
the
most
famous
shrine
in
colombia
to
it
come
pilgrims
from
all
the
republic
from
ecuador
and
even
further
afield
to
be
cured
of
their
ills
on
the
way
down
to
it
we
fell
in
with
an
old
man
driving
an
ass
and
heard
the
simple
story
of
the
founding
of
the
sacred
city
centuries
ago
the
virgin
had
appeared
here
and
given
a
small
child
a
statue
of
descended
straight
from
heaven
because
it
has
a
real
face
that
bleeds
if
it
is
pricked
or
if
hair
is
pulled
then
she
had
ordered
the
bishop
of
riobamba
to
build
a
chapel
in
the
living
rock
of
the
mountain
on
the
site
of
the
apparition
our
informant
was
vociferous
in
his
assertion
that
the
virgin
daily
cured
victims
of
lameness
blindness
barrenness
and
a
hundred
other
ailments
but
he
offered
no
explanation
of
the
fact
that
though
he
had
lived
in
las
lajas
all
his
life
he
was
almost
sightless
from
ophthalmia
the
village
stacked
up
the
sheer
wall
of
a
gorge
in
the
far
depths
of
which
roared
a
small
but
powerful
stream
had
about
it
that
something
peculiar
to
all
sacred
cities
intangible
hint
of
unknown
danger
perhaps
from
fanaticism
of
ignorance
something
of
the
sadness
that
comes
upon
the
traveler
at
such
evidences
of
the
gullibility
of
mankind
several
posadas
de
peligrinos
crude
copies
of
the
of
jerusalem
and
many
little
shops
and
stalls
like
those
of
puree
town
of
the
juggernaut
furnish
pilgrims
with
lodgings
food
blessed
trinkets
and
tons
of
english
candles
to
burn
before
the
miraculous
image
ragged
boys
left
off
their
to
beg
una
little
alms
for
the
virgin
as
we
descended
through
the
town
and
went
down
by
the
sharpest
zigzags
to
the
white
temple
with
its
twin
towers
hanging
on
the
edge
of
the
rocky
gorge
like
encrusted
foam
of
the
waterfall
that
pitched
into
it
though
they
make
long
journeys
to
implore
her
favor
the
pilgrims
have
not
reverence
enough
for
their
virgin
to
reform
their
unspeakable
personal
habits
and
every
story
of
the
holy
edifice
was
an
offence
to
eyes
and
nose
the
worker
of
miracles
was
the
usual
placid
faced
doll
in
rich
vestments
and
gleaming
more
likely
paste
imitations
of
those
which
the
monks
keep
safely
locked
away
in
their
a
thick
glass
screen
against
which
indians
flattened
their
noses
in
supplication
the
rolling
hills
of
ecuador
lay
close
before
us
when
we
strode
into
ipiales
the
last
town
of
colombia
and
the
coldest
place
we
had
known
since
our
last
northern
winter
at
this
rate
the
equator
would
prove
the
place
was
said
to
have
much
commerce
with
the
neighboring
republic
but
the
only
signs
we
saw
of
it
were
a
few
troops
of
shivering
donkeys
a
mere
five
miles
separates
ipiales
from
the
frontier
and
we
had
soon
left
behind
the
land
of
liberty
and
order
and
entered
that
of
the
equator
the
road
crawling
dizzily
along
the
face
of
a
precipice
descends
to
a
collection
of
huts
called
for
rock
bridge
which
it
is
indeed
for
the
boundary
river
carchi
races
under
a
huge
natural
arch
across
which
the
camino
real
passes
without
a
tremor
to
our
surprise
there
were
no
frontier
formalities
whatever
ecuador
was
not
even
represented
the
two
colombian
customs
officials
diffident
but
kindly
pastusos
asserted
that
no
duties
were
collected
on
goods
passing
between
the
two
countries
unless
they
were
of
foreign
origin
their
task
was
merely
to
keep
account
of
whatever
passed
the
boundary
for
what
purpose
was
not
apparent
unless
it
was
to
provide
a
sinecure
for
political
henchmen
an
hour
later
we
were
surprising
the
ecuadorians
lolling
about
the
bare
sanded
plaza
of
tulcán
only
a
lone
telegraph
wire
had
followed
us
over
the
frontier
yet
the
two
countries
blended
into
each
other
so
completely
that
an
uninformed
traveler
would
not
have
guessed
that
he
had
crossed
an
international
boundary
in
the
were
housed
a
soldiers
rather
insolent
fellows
despite
their
indian
blood
their
gaily
colored
ruanas
giving
tulcán
a
needed
touch
of
color
engaged
in
the
rather
passive
occupation
of
protecting
their
little
country
from
the
pressure
of
the
larger
one
above
by
the
time
i
had
lessened
our
burden
of
silver
by
changing
it
into
bills
of
the
country
hays
had
fallen
in
with
the
the
of
all
the
canton
who
bade
us
make
our
home
in
his
bachelor
parlor
as
long
as
we
chose
to
remain
the
room
was
the
most
magnificent
we
had
seen
since
bogotá
with
long
solemn
rows
of
upholstered
chairs
and
dignified
framed
family
portraits
that
would
not
have
gladdened
an
artist
s
heart
and
two
long
but
sadly
narrow
sofas
covered
with
a
cloth
that
after
weeks
on
the
planks
and
floors
of
colombia
seemed
elusive
luxury
personified
the
jefe
bade
us
keep
our
hats
on
and
left
us
with
the
quito
newspapers
of
a
week
back
our
first
touch
with
the
outside
world
in
some
time
i
suspected
that
tulcán
s
chief
dignitary
had
not
treated
us
so
regally
out
of
mere
kindness
of
heart
and
the
suspicion
was
duly
verified
we
had
stretched
out
on
our
elusive
couches
and
hays
was
already
feigning
it
most
successfully
the
jefe
arrived
from
a
merry
evening
with
his
aids
and
drew
me
into
a
conversation
that
promised
to
have
no
end
under
the
guise
of
giving
me
information
he
set
himself
to
finding
out
entirely
by
indirection
what
might
be
our
real
motive
in
entering
ecuador
by
the
back
door
unannounced
though
he
never
for
a
moment
suggested
his
suspicions
openly
it
was
a
late
hour
before
he
gave
any
evidence
of
being
convinced
that
there
was
nothing
sinister
and
perilous
to
the
welfare
of
his
country
behind
our
simple
story
then
he
grew
confidential
and
announced
that
as
men
who
had
and
might
again
be
wandering
in
foreign
parts
we
were
sure
to
run
across
two
miscreants
on
whom
he
would
like
to
lay
his
hands
one
was
deciderio
vanquathem
of
belgium
described
as
a
ferrotype
photographer
and
a
performer
of
no
mean
ability
he
had
married
a
cousin
of
the
jefe
and
borrowed
a
thousand
sucres
of
our
host
to
start
a
show
only
to
disappear
a
week
later
leaving
his
wife
but
not
the
thousand
sucres
behind
the
impression
left
by
the
jefe
s
complaint
was
that
if
he
had
reversed
the
process
there
would
have
been
no
hard
feeling
we
were
asked
to
keep
an
eye
out
also
for
one
francisco
fabra
boasting
himself
a
frenchman
who
had
written
from
ashcord
akron
ohio
proposing
marriage
to
one
of
the
jefe
s
sisters
but
who
had
dropped
out
of
sight
upon
receipt
of
her
photograph
no
se
debe
burlarse
así
de
las
man
should
play
such
jests
on
a
woman
cried
the
jefe
fiercely
had
we
not
fallen
in
next
morning
with
two
indians
likewise
bound
i
am
not
sure
we
should
ever
have
reached
san
gabriel
we
were
soon
engaged
in
an
utterly
unpeopled
series
of
páramos
lofty
swept
by
icy
winds
covered
only
with
tufts
of
yellow
and
myriads
of
frailejones
clumps
of
leaves
on
a
stem
from
six
inches
to
two
feet
high
that
peered
at
us
through
the
mist
like
shivering
diffident
mountain
children
our
companions
assured
us
that
the
plant
was
thus
known
because
of
its
resemblance
to
a
priest
in
his
pulpit
and
that
the
leaves
were
highly
efficacious
against
headache
there
was
also
the
a
kind
of
wild
pineapple
with
leaves
that
gave
it
the
appearance
of
that
form
of
cactus
known
as
spanish
bayonet
the
heart
of
which
resembling
a
large
onion
or
a
small
cabbage
is
sold
as
food
in
the
markets
of
the
region
then
for
a
long
way
the
trail
led
through
a
forest
reeking
in
mud
which
we
could
only
pass
by
jumping
from
bog
to
bog
and
clinging
to
trees
along
the
way
san
gabriel
sits
conspicuously
and
apparently
unashamed
on
the
summit
of
an
andean
knoll
its
streets
falling
away
into
the
valley
on
every
side
in
the
outskirts
we
came
upon
a
game
new
to
both
of
us
in
the
irregular
field
that
formed
the
plaza
before
a
bulking
mud
church
a
barefoot
indian
men
and
boys
each
in
a
ruana
of
distinctive
gay
color
reaching
to
the
knees
were
pursuing
a
sphere
about
half
the
size
of
a
football
each
player
had
bound
on
his
right
hand
like
the
of
the
spanish
player
a
large
round
instrument
of
rawhide
of
the
form
of
a
flat
or
a
banjo
the
rules
of
the
game
were
evidently
similar
to
handball
or
tennis
hoping
for
some
suggestion
of
aboriginal
originality
i
asked
a
player
what
the
game
was
called
pelota
ball
señor
he
answered
laconically

left

suddenly
the
bell
of
the
whitewashed

the
players
piled
their
gloves
hastily
in
the
form
of
a
cross
and
every
living
person
in
the
plaza
male
or
female
snatched
off
their
hats
and
poured
into
the
place
of
worship
from
which
arose
some
weird
species
of
music
as
we
pushed
on
into
the
town
a
letter
from
the
jefe
of
tulcán
gave
us
the
entrée
to
the
parlor
of
one
of
his
relatives
the
fortnightly
mail
had
just
arrived
and
don
manuel
was
dictating
letters
to
his
daughter
who
wrote
slowly
and
painfully
in
a
hand
dipping
an
ancient
steel
pen
into
a
medieval
inkwell
between
each
word
when
we
returned
at
dark
from
a
dingy
little
shop
in
which
supper
consisted
chiefly
of
kind
of
corn
pudding
wrapped
in
found
don
manuel
his
wife
and
four
daughters
all
gathered
in
a
family
conference
over
the
letter
each
offering
suggestions
not
as
to
its
subject
matter
but
on
the
dotting
of
the
i
s
and
the
crossing
of
the
t
s
a
controversy
which
raged
long
and
vociferously
then
there
came
marching
into
the
room
a
huge
mattress
under
which
on
close
inspection
we
made
out
the
feet
of
an
indian
boy
and
the
family
announced
that
they
were
going
to
visit
a
polite
subterfuge
to
withdraw
and
leave
us
free
to
go
to
bed
the
parlor
was
typical
of
the
best
room
of
rural
south
americans
a
forest
of
chairs
in
shrouds
and
a
chaos
of
gaudy
cluttered
a
chamber
musty
with
little
use
on
the
walls
were
framed
portraits
of
the
pudgy
family
ancestors
back
to
the
days
of
ruffles
and
powdered
wigs
all
draped
with
mourning
crêpe
the
family
library
consisted
of
barely
a
half
dozen
books
all
of
the
general
style
of
tomás
á

imitación
de

except
for
a
copy
of
an
agricultural
journal
in
spanish
published
in
buffalo
there
are
three
routes
from
san
gabriel
to
ibarra
to
our
surprise
we
learned
that
all
of
them
far
from
following
the
high
plateau
descended
again
into
the
hot
country
for
the
valley
of
the
chota
cuts
a
mighty
slash
entirely
across
ecuador
a
bit
north
of
the
imbabura
volcano
the
indians
told
us
the
road
was
it
was
the
most
exact
information
we
ever
had
from
men
of
their
race
anything
more
stony
would
be
difficult
to
imagine
during
all
the
afternoon
there
was
not
a
moment
in
which
we
were
not
descending
swiftly
our
thigh
muscles
set
with
the
tautness
of
by
an
ever
more
road
that
curved
in
and
out
along
the
flanks
of
a
barren
range
forming
loops
as
perfect
as
the
written
m
of
an
expert
in
penmanship
on
our
left
an
enormous
gash
in
the
earth
dreary
with
no
other
vegetation
than
the
enough
called
méjico
in
this
region
our
right
so
close
it
all
but
grazed
our
elbows
the
tawny
shale
mountainside
seeming
to
rise
and
grow
as
we
descended
where
the
cold
winds
of
the
highlands
turned
tepid
indians
disappeared
for
a
long
space
there
was
no
sign
of
man
with
every
turn
of
the
road
the
heat
grew
more
tropical
a
green
spot
appeared
almost
directly
beneath
us
hazy
as
a
crumpled
green
rag
with
an
indistinct
light
shining
behind
it
then
two
negroes
passed
the
first
we
had
seen
since
leaving
the
cauca
the
road
pitched
headlong
down
a
slope
donkeys
and
more
negroes
appeared
and
the
green
patch
developed
into
fields
of
sugarcane
beyond
them
by
a
bridge
we
crossed
the
chota
river
and
found
ourselves
at
sunset
in
the
caserío
de
la
tropical
huts
of
reeds
and
thatch
quite
unlike
the
adobe
dwellings
of
the
highlands
even
in
form
lay
scattered
along
the
further
bank
the
entire
population
was
jet
black
in
color
the
life
of
the
place
as
different
from
the
plateau
above
as
if
we
had
suddenly
been
transported
to
another
continent
boisterous
laughter
broke
often
on
the
thickening
dusk
above
the
chattering
tongues
resounded
frequently
the
screams
of
an
exploded
jest
or
a
sudden
quarrel
a
piccaninny
bawled
lustily
startling
us
into
the
realization
that
we
had
never
yet
heard
an
indian
baby
cry
the
insolence
of
these
descendants
of
the
slaves
once
imported
in
large
numbers
for
the
sugar
plantations
of
ecuador
who
in
the
half
century
since
the
abolition
of
slavery
had
drifted
into
this
tropical
valley
to
bask
in
the
sun
was
in
striking
contrast
to
the
obsequiousness
of
the
andean
indian
beside
the
two
rows
of
straw
and
reed
shacks
of
the
negroes
stood
a
government
building
of
stone
and
mud
one
end
of
which
was
the
telegraph
office
in
it
the
operator
who
had
left
two
days
before
to
visit
some
relatives
for
a
few
hours
had
locked
two
kids
that
bleated
incessantly
the
open
portion
of
the
building
was
a
shambles
miles
from
the
top
to
the
bottom
of
the
andes
had
left
our
feet
no
fit
even
after
soaking
them
in
the
chota
yet
we
hesitated
long
before
attempting
to
clear
a
space
to
lie
down
luckily
i
still
had
a
in
my
pack
in
a
far
corner
some
energetic
traveler
had
built
a
cot
of
reeds
laid
across
two
sticks
but
it
had
long
since
rotted
to
uselessness
rumor
had
it
that
the
negroes
of
chota
were
skilled
assassins
and
the
demeanor
of
the
hamlet
was
by
no
means
reassuring
we
laid
our
weapons
beside
us
on
the
stone
floor
but
dared
not
close
the
door
for
fear
of
drowning
in
our
own
sweat
all
the
night
through
i
woke
frequently
with
the
sensation
of
some
one
creeping
in
upon
us
but
dawn
broke
without
any
definite
proof
that
the
peril
had
been
anything
worse
than
the
offspring
of
an
overheated
imagination
it
would
be
task
enough
to
climb
from
chota
to
ibarra
on
the
strength
of
a
hearty
meal
to
make
it
from
a
lazy
negro
village
where
not
even
a
swallow
of
coffee
was
to
be
had
approached
torture
hour
after
hour
we
toiled
upward
through
a
choking
desert
of
sand
and
broken
stone
pitched
at
the
angle
of
a
steep
stairway
there
runs
a
story
of
the
chota
suggestive
of
the
barrier
it
presents
to
modern
progress
archer
harman
the
american
who
lifted
the
railway
of
guayaquil
to
the
plains
of
quito
strolling
along
the
streets
of
the
ecuadorian
capital
one
day
chanced
to
meet
one
of
his
american
engineers
he
said
shifting
his
cigar
to
the
other
cheek
get
out
of
here
morning
and
see
what
the
chances
are
for
a
railroad
to
the
engineer
sallied
forth
next
day
on
muleback
with
such
equipment
or
lack
thereof
as
can
be
had
in
quito
in
a
hurry
three
months
later
he
rode
back
into
the
city
of
the
equator
well
you
re
back
eh
said
his
chief
what
d
it
cost
us
to
run
her
through
the
chota
valley
about
seventy
miles
of
grade
in
shale
replied
the
engineer
hum
said
harman
there
won
t
be
any
railroad
to
which
is
one
of
the
many
reasons
why
the
nebulous
railway
still
exists
only
in
the
minds
of
inexperienced
dreamers
hours
up
we
began
to
pass
groups
of
meek
indians
easily
distinguishable
by
their
costume
from
the
tribes
to
the
north
they
spoke
a
guttural
yet
sibilant
language
that
could
be
none
other
than
quichua
the
ancient
tongue
of
the
incas
and
i
took
occasion
to
test
the
vocabulary
we
had
gleaned
by
putting
an
unnecessary
question
ñan
ibarrata
to
which
the
oldest
of
the
group
replied
at
once
in
fluent
though
accented
spanish
without
the
shadow
of
a
smile
sí
señor
this
is
the
road
to
ibarra
before
noon
we
were
sharing
a
gallon
of
chicha
at
the
top
of
the
range
several
volcanoes
thrusting
their
white
heads
through
the
clouds
about
us
ibarra
and
her
fertile
green
slopes
were
plainly
visible
a
dozen
villages
dotted
the
landscape
and
the
two
roads
to
quito
wound
away
over
the
opposite
flanks
of
imbabura
towering
into
the
sky
beyond
and
cutting
off
half
the
southern
horizon
below
us
spread
the
famous
yaguarcocha
the
lake
of
at
the
height
of
his
power
huayna
ccápac
thirteenth
inca
had
pushed
his
conquests
over
the
equator
when
the
caranquis
a
warlike
tribe
of
the
valley
before
us
revolted
the
army
sent
against
them
exterminated
the
caranqui
warriors
and
threw
their
bodies
into
the
lake
turning
its
waters
according
to
the
legend
and
giving
it
the
name
it
bears
to
this
day
its
shores
were
white
with
encrusted
salt
and
like
so
many
lakes
of
the
andean
highlands
so
completely
surrounded
by
reedy
swamps
that
we
were
forced
to
abandon
the
swim
we
had
promised
ourselves
before
entering
the
principal
city
of
ecuador
north
of
the
capital
ibarra
is
a
still
and
dignified
old
town
of
some
inhabitants
founded
in
under
the
spanish
viceroy
from
whom
it
took
its
name
as
a
residence
for
the
white
men
of
the
region
between
pasto
and
quito
on
the
site
of
the
old
indian
village
of
caranqui
in
spite
of
the
extreme
fertility
of
the
surrounding
valley
and
its
peerless
climate
many
of
its
houses
stood
empty
and
several
buildings
of
colonial
days
were
still
the
ruins
the
great
earthquake
of
many
years
ago
had
left
them
the
keeper
of
the
little
that
actually
and
publicly
announced
itself
abandoned
to
us
her
own
quarters
densely
furnished
with
photographs
frail
chairs
tables
sofas
cane
lounge
and
an
immense
canopied
bed
to
say
nothing
of
the
extraordinary
luxury
of
a
newspaper
only
two
days
old
to
offset
the
pleasure
of
the
first
real
bed
in
weeks
however
the
town
kept
us
awake
most
of
the
night
with
a
local
fiesta
we
had
been
so
lacking
in
foresight
as
to
arrive
on
the
day
sacred
to
the
virgen
de
la
the
celebration
began
early
in
the
afternoon
an
endless
train
of
indians
in
a
bedlam
of
colors
trooped
across
the
town
under
great
bundles
of
dry
brush
gathered
far
away
in
the
hills
a
haughty
chief
on
horseback
riding
up
and
down
the
line
giving
his
orders
in
sputtering
quichua
men
women
and
children
deposited
their
loads
on
the
bare
plaza
before
a
old
church
and
ambled
away
for
more
five
immense
heaps
had
been
laid
out
in
the
form
of
a
cross
when
a
priest
sallied
forth
to
sprinkle
them
with
holy
water
in
the
thickening
dusk
the
entire
town
gathered
amid
a
deafening
din
of
battered
church
bells
the
explosion
of
thousands
of
fireworks
and
cannon
crackers
the
blare
of
a
tireless
band
and
the
howling
of
the
populace
and
its
swarming
curs
the
brush
cross
was
lighted
by
a
priest
in
rich
vestments
and
a
pandemonium
that
may
have
been
pleasing
to
the
sleepless
virgin
raged
the
whole
night
through
the
driftwood
of
the
festival
in
the
form
of
chicha
victims
sprawled
on
their
backs
in
streets
and
gutters
littered
the
town
when
we
set
out
to
climb
to
the
frozen
equator
at
cayambe
a
wide
highway
strode
up
through
the
indian
town
of
caranqui
birthplace
of
atahuallpa
best
loved
son
of
huayna
ccápac
and
of
paccha
daughter
of
the
conquered
scyri
who
once
ruled
the
territory
of
the
quitus
and
away
due
southward
over
the
left
shoulder
of
imbabura
for
the
first
miles
it
was
so
crowded
with
indians
in
crude
red
blankets
heavy
gray
felt
hats
and
bare
legs
that
it
seemed
the
migration
of
some
tribe
from
another
world
all
sidestepped
like
hindu
coolies
and
even
the
women
touched
their
hats
to
us
as
they
passed
greeting
us
sometimes
in
spanish
but
more
often
in
quichua
to
the
west
rose
the
peak
of
cotacache
sharp
as
a
dog
s
tooth
and
the
view
of
ibarra
and
her
fertile
valley
opened
up
below
and
behind
us
like
an
unfolding
map
then
a
ridge
wiped
out
town
and
jogging
indians
and
left
us
only
the
gaunt
spreading
mountain
world
to
look
upon
thirty
miles
lay
behind
us
when
we
entered
cayambe
a
drowsy
place
of
no
great
size
the
chill
of
the
blue
capping
the
great
volcano
of
the
same
name
that
bulks
into
the
heavens
close
beside
it
sweeping
through
the
dreary
streets
unhampered
next
day
a
long
and
tiresome
eight
leagues
led
across
a
desolate
and
parched
country
fissured
by
enormous
earthquake
cracks
but
for
the
discovery
of
a
new
drink
of
unknown
might
have
stumbled
across
the
equator
in
far
worse
state
than
those
who
first
pass
it
within
the
realms
of
father
neptune
a
drought
had
fallen
upon
the
region
so
long
since
that
even
the
cactus
had
given
up
in
despair
all
day
long
cayambe
stood
forth
clear
and
blue
over
our
left
shoulders
and
far
off
to
the
hazy
southwest
the
horizon
was
walled
by
a
vast
range
the
highest
point
of
which
was
evidently
pichincha
at
the
foot
of
which
lay
the
end
of
our
present
journey
with
our
goal
so
near
at
hand
we
found
it
difficult
to
hold
ourselves
overnight
in
the
oasis
of
guayllabamba
the
sandy
streets
of
which
were
half
paved
with
the
stones
of
alligator
pears
by
daylight
we
had
descended
to
the
river
and
begun
the
unbroken
climb
of
more
than
feet
to
the
top
of
the
succeeding
range
a
wide
highway
now
led
due
west
between
cactus
hedges
through
a
country
so
desert
dry
that
both
stock
and
people
seemed
to
be
choking
and
the
fear
came
upon
us
that
quito
too
would
be
suffering
such
a
famine
of
thirst
that
our
plan
to
take
up
temporary
residence
there
would
turn
to
disappointment
another
steep
climb
brought
to
view
all
pichincha
and
its
surrounding
world
yet
nowhere
was
there
any
sign
of
quito
the
highway
swung
south
rising
and
falling
gently
here
and
there
between
dry
fields
fenced
with
cactus
or
mud
walls
a
town
tucked
away
in
the
wrinkle
of
the
range
beside
us
in
a
shelter
at
the
roadside
an
indian
woman
selling
steaming
soup
with
a
bit
of
meat
and
tiny
potatoes
in
it
served
us
in
a
single
earthenware
plate
with
wooden
spoons
as
impassively
as
she
did
her
own
people
further
on
groups
of
aborigines
were
burning
off
over
brush
fires
the
bristles
of
slaughtered
pigs
that
lay
in
batches
of
a
split
open
at
the
road
edge
a
carriage
passed
the
first
we
had
seen
in
weeks
then
an
automobile
a
man
in
european
clothes
wearing
shoes
yet
actually
walking
a
child
of
parents
a
motley
crowd
chiefly
indians
in
gaudy
ponchos
came
and
went
large
buildings
grew
up
on
either
side
of
us
the
highway
passing
through
green
groves
of
eucalyptus
pungent
with
the
smell
of
australian
gum
took
on
the
name
of
of
september
it
was
really
the
all
at
once
quito
in
its
afternoon
burst
out
before
us
in
its
mountain
hollow
a
great
grassy
mound
cutting
off
the
horizon
on
the
south
days
had
passed
since
we
had
walked
out
of
the
central
plaza
of
bogotá
during
fifteen
of
which
we
had
done
no
walking
our
pedometer
reported
the
distance
thence
miles
and
we
had
each
spent
a
dollar
for
each
day
of
the
journey
hays
had
set
out
weighing
and
i
we
arrived
weighing
and
respectively
we
may
not
have
presented
quite
so
bedraggled
an
appearance
as
the
remnant
of
gonzalo
pizarro
s
band
on
their
return
from
the
wilderness
of
the

we
were
certainly
no

experiences
to
be
written
but
i
had
long
since
planned
to
become
a
bona
fide
resident
of
a
typical
small
south
american
capital
a
letter
of
introduction
won
me
quarters
in
the
home
of
señor
don
francisco
ordoñez
v
in
the
calle
flores
while
hays
hung
up
his
hat
in
even
more
sumptuous
surroundings
around
the
corner
but
not
so
fast
not
even
don
panchito
would
have
received
me
in
the
state
of
sartorial
delapidation
of
our
arrival
the
people
of
quito
are
somewhat
less
rigid
disciples
of
beau
brummel
than
those
of
bogotá
but
they
are
still
far
from
negligent
in
dress
most
of
the
clothes
indispensable
to
our
entrance
into
the
ranks
of
the
gente
decente
had
been
mailed
in
jirardot
the
rest
had
been
turned
over
to
the
american
drummer
in
cali
the
first
shock
quito
had
in
store
for
us
was
the
information
that
no
parcel
of
any
shape
or
description
had
come
from
colombia
in
months
the
second
was
the
discovery
that
the
had
not
arrived
it
was
hard
to
realize
that
we
had
outwalked
all
the
established
means
of
transportation
in
this
equatorial
land
an
unavoidable
round
of
the
shops
wiped
out
the
remnant
of
my
savings
as
a
policeman
and
brought
me
down
again
to
the
letter
of
credit
that
had
lain
fallow
more
than
a
half
year
except
for
suits
the
cost
of
replenishing
a
wardrobe
was
startling
clothing
for
men
is
rare
in
the
cities
of
the
andes
and
it
is
far
more
economical
to
be
fitted
to
order
in
one
of
the
that
abound
in
almost
every
street
little
rooms
their
fronts
all
doorway
in
which
sit
anemic
youths
sewing
languidly
yet
incessantly
now
and
then
carrying
the
goose
out
into
the
street
to
blow
out
the
ashes
and
as
dependent
on
the
passing
throng
for
inspiration
as
the
craftsmen
of
damascus
as
in
the
more
northern
capital
the
chief
line
of
demarkation
between
the
and
the
of
quito
is
the
white
collar
naturally
the
tendency
is
to
make
it
as
wide
and
distinct
as
possible
i
had
canvassed
the
entire
city
before
i
found
my
customary
brand
of
four
times
its
american
to
discover
that
the
lowest
collar
in
stock
was
designed
for
some
species
of
human
giraffe
you
misunderstand
me
i
protested
i
did
not
ask
for
a
this
is
a
collar
señor
cried
the
shopkeeper
something
lower
but
this
is
a
very
low
collar
it
is
so
low
that
no
one
in
quito
will
wear
it
and
we
are
not
importing
any
more
of
this
in
the
matter
of
shoes
i
found
at
last
a
massachusetts
product
that
might
have
served
but
when
i
had
beaten
the
dealer
down
to
about
twice
the
american
price
a
seven
was
found
to
be
the
largest
size
in
stock
the
merchant
seemed
on
the
verge
of
tears
why
señor
he
gasped
gazing
resentfully
at
the
offending
member
there
is
not
a
foot
in
quito
as
large
as
that
he
did
not
mean
exactly
what
he
said
but
it
was
natural
that
he
should
have
had
in
mind
only
the
minority
of
quiteños
who
wear
shoes
these
squeeze
their
feet
into
articles
of
effeminate
toothpick
shape
for
custom
s
sake
as
they
force
their
necks
into
collars
that
come
little
short
of
hanging
and
have
their
trousers
made
that
their
feet
may
look
still
more
ladylike
one
can
not
of
course
pose
as
an
aristocrat
on
the
broad
hoofs
of
an
indian
in
the
end
i
was
forced
to
submit
to
de
an
imitation
shoe
made
in
guayaquil
hays
concluded
that
with
a
general
overhauling
he
could
pass
muster
until
our
bundles
arrived
but
on
one
point
immediate
renewal
was
unavoidable
he
paused
in
the
doorway
of
one
of
the
little
sewing
dens
to
ask
can
you
make
me
a
pair
of
trousers
by
saturday
night
in
spite
of
having
pillowed
for
weeks
on
ramsey
hays
never
could
remember
that
castilian
trousers
come
singly
un
par
señor
cried
the
tailor
ah
no
that
is
impossible
so
soon
i
can
make
you
a
trouser
by
then
but
not
two
of
them
then
while
you
are
wearing
the
one
i
can
perhaps
make
the
other
if
the
señor
is
in
such
oh
all
right
said
hays
suddenly
recalling
that
trousers
mean
in
spanish
go
ahead
i
ll
try
to
get
along
with
one
over
the
error
persisted
however
it
was
not
three
days
later
that
he
was
halted
at
the
door
of
his
lodgings
by
a
whining
beggar
una
caridad
caballero
have
you
not
perhaps
some
old
clothes
to
give
a
poor
unfortunate
illustration
a
view
of
quito
backed
by
the
panecillo
that
bottles
it
up
on
the
south
there
are
six
in
sight
illustration
a
patio
of
the
monastery
of
san
francisco
one
of
the
eighteen
monasteries
and
convents
of
quito
said
to
be
the
most
extensive
in
the
western
hemisphere
sure
said
the
generous
of
police
i
ll
bring
you
down
a
pair
of
he
did
so
whereupon
the
beggar
growled
angrily
but
you
said
a
pair
where
is
the
other
one
few
quiteño
dwellings
are
equipped
with
bathrooms
i
halted
a
passerby
to
inquire
for
a
public
de
and
was
directed
to
the
foot
of
the
calle
rocafuerte
hot
baths
i
queried
suspiciously
certainly
señor
he
answered
haughtily
if
you
go
there
any
morning
about
ten
when
the
sun
is
shining
you
will
find
them
quite
a
crumbling
old
adobe
gate
marked
baños
de
milagro
gave
entrance
to
an
aged
building
of
the
same
material
passing
through
this
i
was
astonished
to
find
spread
out
before
me
what
looked
like
an
immense
outdoor
it
was
illusion
nearer
approach
showed
a
broad
sheet
of
water
barely
six
inches
deep
a
of
it
warming
in
the
sun
i
suddenly
recalled
that
the
same
word
serves
in
spanish
for
all
degrees
of
temperature
from
hot
to
about
the
basin
were
many
little
adobe
dens
in
the
center
of
each
a
stone
basin
some
four
feet
deep
with
steps
leading
down
into
it
the
fee
was
a
mere
five
cents
for
the
streams
that
course
down
the
face
of
pichincha
are
abundant
an
indian
scrubbed
out
the
pool
with
a
broom
fashioned
from
a
bundle
of
fagots
and
turned
it
full
of
a
water
so
clear
that
i
could
have
read
a
newspaper
at
the
bottom
but
the
heating
apparatus
was
not
particularly
effective
when
the
icy
mountain
water
had
filled
the
stone
basin
cold
as
only
a
shaded
spot
at
this
altitude
can
be
the
uninured
gringo
could
only
grit
his
teeth
clutch
desperately
at
his
bar
of
imported
english
soap
and
plunge
quickly
out
again
one
such
experience
was
enough
to
explain
why
quito
shows
so
decided
an
aversion
to
the
bath
my
residence
in
the
city
was
all
but
nipped
in
the
bud
by
a
mere
matter
of
red
tape
again
the
shock
was
administered
at
the
when
i
presented
the
registry
slips
for
the
package
of
notes
on
which
my
proposed
volume
depended
they
were
all
there
sure
enough
the
seals
still
unbroken
but
as
i
opened
them
for
customs
inspection
the
startled
employees
cried
out
in
horrified
chorus
señor
it
is
against
the
law
to
send
manuscript
by
mail
in
ecuador
these
were
mailed
in
the
united
states
where
it
is
not
against
the
no
importa
it
is
illegal
for
them
to
ride
in
the
ecuadorian
mails
they
will
have
to
be
confiscated
by
the
what
can
the
government
do
with
them
i
asked
innocently
burn
them
of
course
replied
the
clerk
luckily
the
laws
of
ecuador
are
not
so
inexorable
and
incorruptible
as
those
of
some
other
lands
but
i
passed
a
far
from
pleasant
hour
before
i
discovered
that
saving
fact
just
where
the
line
is
drawn
between
manuscrito
and
mere
letters
i
was
never
able
to
learn
at
any
rate
the
sender
of
the
offending
notes
is
still
wanted
i
believe
to
serve
a
year
in
the
penitentiary
of
quito
i
had
not
been
three
days
in
the
city
of
the
equator
when
i
began
to
feel
the
necessity
for
exercise
the
best
families
lead
a
very
sedentary
and
physically
idle
existence
virtually
spending
their
lives
at
the
bottom
of
a
hole
in
the
ground
for
such
the
central
plaza
and
the
few
adjoining
squares
about
which
it
is
customary
to
stroll
might
be
called
yet
there
are
innumerable
views
and
picturesque
corners
to
reward
him
who
will
climb
out
and
climb
he
must
for
the
city
lies
in
a
fold
of
the
skirts
of
pichincha
out
of
which
almost
every
street
mounts
more
or
less
steeply
the
main
plaza
is
the
heart
of
ecuador
in
its
center
instead
of
the
handsome
brass
fountain
of
stevenson
s
day
rises
a
tall
showy
monument
topped
by
a
bronze
victory
or
liberty
or
some
other
exotic
bird
while
at
its
base
cringes
an
allegorical
spanish
lion
with
a
look
of
pained
disgust
on
his
face
and
an
arrow
through
his
liver
much
of
the
square
is
floored
with
cement
blinding
to
the
eyes
under
the
equatorial
sun
and
only
mildly
relieved
by
staid
and
too
carefully
tended
plots
where
violets
pansies
yellow
poppies
and
many
a
flower
known
only
to
the
region
bloom
perennially
its
diagonal
walks
see
most
of
quito
pass
at
least
once
a
day
but
neither
indians
nor
the
ragged
classes
pause
to
sit
on
its
benches
nor
may
anyone
carrying
a
bundle
pass
its
the
guard
chances
to
be
doing
something
other
than
his
appointed
duty
on
the
east
the
square
is
flanked
by
the
government
palace
housing
the
presidency
the
ministry
both
houses
of
congress
the
ecuador
s
main
and
considerable
else
yet
still
finding
room
for
several
shops
under
its
portico
to
the
south
siding
on
rather
than
facing
the
square
its
towers
barely
rising
above
the
roof
is
the
low
cathedral
in
which
are
the
tombs
both
of
sucre
and
his
reputed
assassin
flores
the
washington
of
the
third
and
fourth
sides
are
flanked
by
the
archbishop
s
palace
and
the
municipality
both
with
arcades
beneath
which
are
dozens
of
little
shops
and
filled
from
pillar
to
pillar
with
hawkers
and
their
no
less
motley
wares
every
street
of
the
city
is
roughly
cobbled
with
a
row
of
flagstones
along
its
center
for
indian
carriers
and
beasts
of
burden
and
on
either
side
a
narrow
slanting
walk
on
which
the
pedestrian
whose
appearance
suggests
the
lower
social
standing
is
expected
to
yield
the
passage
rambling
over
a
rolling
at
times
almost
hilly
site
every
street
is
due
sooner
or
later
to
run
off
into
the
air
on
a
hillside
or
to
fade
suddenly
away
into
a
noisome
lane
quito
has
no
residential
section
its
chiefly
buildings
are
with
rare
exceptions
constructed
of
mud
blocks
on
frames
of
the
light
pithy
stalk
of
the
giant
cactus
with
roofs
of
the
familiar
tiles
whitewash
and
paint
of
many
colors
strive
in
vain
to
conceal
this
plebeian
material
and
many
a
façade
is
gay
with
ornamentation
people
who
are
commonly
the
owners
of
the
building
they
dwell
in

the
second
floor
the
lower
story
of
the
city
is
the
business
section
that
portion
of
the
house
facing
the
street
is
almost
certain
to
be
given
over
to
from
one
to
several
shops

patio

as
a
yard
for
the
loading
and
unloading

opening

retainers

dwell
almost
anywhere
in
quito
is
to
live
in
the
upper
air
of
a
combination
of
slums
and
business
houses
and
whatever
the
wealth
or
boasted
aristocracy
of
a
family
it
is
certain
to
come
into
daily
contact
with
the
unwashed
del
that
inhabits
its
lower
regions
and
performs
its
menial
tasks
there
are
shops
enough
in
quito
to
all
appearances
to
supply
the
demands
if
not
the
needs
of
all
the
million
and
a
half
inhabitants
of
ecuador
these
are
for
the
most
part
small
dungeons
without
windows
flush
with
the
sidewalk
with
no
other
front
than
the
doors
that
stand
wide
open
during
business
hours
and
present
at
other
times
their
blank
faces
ornamented
with
several
enormous
padlocks
the
quiteño
puts
no
trust
in
the
small
locks
of
modern
days
many
a
shop
the
entire
stock
of
which
is
not
worth
a
hundred
dollars
is
protected
not
only
by
bolts
and
bars
within
but
by
half
a
dozen
of
those
huge
and
clumsy
contrivances
that
the
rest
of
the
world
used
in
the
middle
ages
to
shut
up
shop
is
a
real
task
in
quito
of
which
the
lugging
home
of
the
enormous
keys
is
by
no
means
the
least
burdensome
naturally
if
a
real
burglar
cared
to
take
the
trouble
to
journey
to
quito
he
would
find
far
less
difficulty
at
his
trade
than
in
a
city
ostensibly
less
secure
besides
the
establishments
of
hundreds
of
men
who
would
rather
wear
a
white
collar
than
work
there
are
innumerable
little
holes
in
the
wall
run
by
women
of
the
people
in
conjunction
with
their
scanty
household
duties
where
chicha
and
stronger
drinks
and
the
few
foodstuffs
of
the
indians
and
the
poorer
classes
are
sometimes
sold
though
there
are
barely
customers
enough
to
go
round
clothing
stores
or
more
exactly
are
perhaps
most
numerous
countless
useless
duplications
of
the
selfsame
stock
with
hundreds
of
bolts
of
as
many
different
weaves
piled
high
in
the
open
doorways
every
merchant
however
meager
his
supplies
announces
himself
an
importer
and
exporter
and
after
morning
mass
women
wander
for
hours
from
shop
to
shop
haggling
for
a
fancied
difference
of
a
half
cent
in
some
purchase
which
in
the
end
is
more
apt
than
not
to
be
abandoned
business
is
petty
at
best
its
ethics
low
and
the
native
quiteño
is
a
weak
competitor
of
the
foreigners
that
swarm

revolution
with
its
accompanying

the
native
shopkeepers
are
frankly
at
the
mercy
of
the
looters
who
only
too
often
are
the
government
itself
but
the
foreigner
despoiled
of
his
wares
can
always
lodge
a
complaint
with
his
home
government
reparation
may
follow
and
even
the
punishment
of
the
looters
is
conceivable
to
warn
these
of
their
peril
and
to
induce
sober
thought
in
times

the

paints
on
his

it
has
much
the
same
atmosphere
of
a
world
apart
a
peaceful
restful
little
sphere
supplied
with
a
few
modern
conveniences
of
a
crude
sort
but
with
little
of
the
complicated
life
of
cities
it
is
a
splendid
place
to
play
at
life
to
lie
fallow
and
catch
up
with
oneself
with
nothing
more
exciting
to
stir
up
existence
than
the
concert
in
the
plaza
mayor
a
score
of
carriages
rattle
over
its
cobbled
streets
the
rails
of
a
tramway
line
had
been
laid
years
before
our
arrival
but
the
cars
had
not
yet
been
ordered
somewhere
there
may
be
a
finer
climate
but
it
would
scarcely
be
worth
while
going
far
to
look
for
it
standing
at
a
height
which
in
the
temperate
zone
would
be
covered
by
eternal
snows
the
city
is
sheltered
by
the
surrounding
ranges
from
the
bitter
chill
that
descends
so
often
upon
less
lofty
bogotá
in
the
colombian
capital
we
were
always
suffering
more
or
less
from
cold
in
our
waking
hours
except
at
midday
in
quito
it
was
possible
to
sit
comfortably
on
a
plaza
bench
at
midnight
with
all
the
stages
of
nature
from
planting
through
blossoms
fruit
and
harvest
existing
side
by
side
its
days
are
like
the
best
culled
from
a
northern
may
there
is
a
popular
saying
that
it
rains
thirteen
months
a
year
in
quito
but
this
is
slander
during
my
long
stay
there
were
to
be
sure
few
days
when
it
did
not
rain
but
the
shower
came
almost
always
at
a
more
or
less
fixed
hour
of
the
afternoon
and
the
resident
soon
learned
to
make
his
plans
accordingly
the
rain
seemed
heavier
than
it
was
in
reality
for
tin
spouts
pour
the
water
noisily
out
into
the
cobbled
streets
the
wide
projecting
eaves
protecting
the
sidewalks
now
and
then
came
a
day
heavy
with
massed
clouds
far
more
often
all
but
an
hour
or
so
was
brilliant
with
sunshine
yet
an
american
schoolma
am
accustomed
to
tell
her
pupils
that
the
people
of
quito
all
dress
in
white
because
it
lies
on
the
equator
would
be
startled
to
see
what
attention
even
a
woman
in
garb
attracts
in
its
streets
on
rare
occasions
a
man
in
white
cotton
passed
through
the
overcoated
plaza
during
the
evening
concert
but
this
meant
only
that
the
train
from
guayaquil
had
arrived
we
met
too
an
american
drummer
more
noted
for
his
ability
as
a
mixer
than
for
his
knowledge
of
geography
who
had
arrived
with
a
carefully
chosen
wardrobe
of
white
linen
proved
a
godsend
to
the
local
tailors
incidentally
he
had
come
down
to
introduce
american
plumbing
in
ecuador
but
that
is
another
and
still
sadder
story
the
truth
is
that
moderate
winter
clothing
is
never
out
of
place
in
the
city
of
the
equator
even
at
noon
with
one
s
shadow
a
round
disk
under
foot
and
the
sun
glaring
to
the
eyes
and
burning
the
skin
in
this
thin
upland
air
a
leisurely
climb
up
one
of
the
longest
streets
brought
no
memories
of
the
tropics
as
in
all
high
altitudes
there
is
a
marked
difference
between
sunshine
and
shade
the
first
greeting
in
a
quiteño
house
is
sure
to
be
cúbrese
usted
put
on
your
hat
and
however
impolite
it
may
seem
to
the
newcomer
none
but
the
unwise
will
disregard
the
suggestion
only
when
one
has
become
acclimated
to
the
room
may
one
uncover
with
impunity
for
to
catch
cold
in
quito
is
a
serious
matter
and
the
road
from
a
cold
to
pneumonia
is
short
and
swift
in
this
thin
air
thanks
to
the
altitude
it
is
the
common
experience
of
newcomers
to
be
either
unduly
exhilarated
or
sunk
in
the
depths
of
despondency
there
is
not
a
chimney
in
quito
and
no
breath
of
smoke
is
ever
known
to
smudge
her
transparent
equatorial
sky
factories
in
the
modern
sense
are
unknown
cooking
is
the
same
simple
operation
as
in
the
rural
districts
of
the
andes
the
quiteño
knows
artificial
heat
if
at
all
only
by
hearsay
i
chanced
to
be
in
the
of
the
minister
of
foreign
affairs
one
afternoon
when
a
newly
appointed
argentine
ambassador
dropped
in
for
his
first
informal
call
in
the
course
of
the
polished
that
ensued
the
diplomat
mentioned
a
new
law
in
buenos
aires
requiring
the
heating
of
public
buildings
during
certain
months
of
the
year
the
minister
an
unusually
man
for
ecuador
stared
a
moment
with
a
puzzled
expression
then
leaning
forward
with
undiplomatic
eagerness
replied
why
i
suppose
you
have
to
have
some
kind
of
artificial
heat
in
those
cold
countries
from
the
center
of
the
city
itself
not
one
of
the
volcanoes
that
encircle
it
like
the
tents
of
a
besieging
army
are
visible
but
a
climb
to
the
rim
of
the
basin
in
any
direction
leads
to
some
point
of
vantage
overlooking
all
quito
and
its
surroundings
of
a
score
of
views
that
is
perhaps
most
striking
from
the
summit
of
the
panecillo
the
little
loaf
that
bottles
up
the
town
on
the
south
is
it
resembles
nothing
so
much
as
a
fat
biscuit
lush
green
in
its
covering
of
perpetual
spring
antiquarians
have
never
agreed
whether
the
panecillo
is
a
natural
hill
or
partly
or
wholly
built
by
man
geologically
it
is
out
of
place
for
all
the
rest
of
the
region
is
rocky
and
broken
and
nowhere
else
in
the
vicinity
has
nature
constructed
any
symmetrical
thing
some
have
it
that
an
already
existing
hill
was
rounded
off
before
the
conquest
as
a
pedestal
for
the
temple
of
the
sun
which
tradition
asserts
adorned
the
summit
long
before
the
coming
of
the
incas
if
it
is
entirely
the
construction
of
the
pyramids
was
an
afternoon
sport
in
comparison
somehow
the
imagination
likes
to
picture
thousands
of
indians
of
both
sexes
and
all
ages
jogging
like
lines
of
tropical
ants
up
and
down
the
sacred
mound
with
baskets
of
earth
on
their
uncomplaining
backs
as
they
still
trot
through
the
streets
of
quito
under
loads
of
every
description
a
road
runs
round
and
round
the
panecillo
making
two
full
revolutions
in
so
leisurely
and
dignified
a
manner
that
it
would
seem
almost
level
did
not
the
city
below
open
out
more
and
more
with
each
step
forward
at
the
summit
across
which
sweeps
a
wind
from
the
south
is
a
view
worth
many
times
such
a
climb
all
quito
lies
huddled
in
its
pocket
below
like
the
body
of
a
spider
with
its
legs
cut
off
at
varying
lengths
the
city
is
clearly
visible
in
its
every
detail
from
the
very
of
its
houses
to
the
ponchos
of
the
indians
crawling
like
minute
specks
across
its
squares
and
along
its
streets
along
the
at
the
base
of
pichincha
s
long
ridge
are
glimpses
of
small
villages
and
countless
little
green
fields
standing
on
the
flank
of
the
range
seem
so
close
at
hand
as
to
be
almost
within
touch
here
the
early
riser
may
watch
the
birth
of
clouds
at
sunrise
the
andes
stand
out
sharp
and
clear
as
if
the
sky
had
been
carefully
swept
during
the
night
then
a
tiny
patch
of
mist
detaches
itself
here
and
there
from
the
damp
flanks
of
pichincha
streaks
of
clouds
begin
to
rise
under
the
warming
sun
like
a
curtain
drawn
from
the
bottom
soon
the
entire
ridge
is
steaming
from
end
to
end
and
before
one
s
very
eyes
come
into
being
and
float
away
across
the
world
those
masses
of
clouds
that
greet
the
late
riser
in
the
transparent
air
of
the
highlands
the
eye
embraces
far
more
than
the
city
the
surrounding
world
being
above
the
is
bare
of
any
vegetation
other
than
the
brown
as
would
be
the
city
and
its
environs
also
but
for
the
thousands
of
eucalyptus
trees
imported
in
the
days
of
garcía
moreno
swinging
round
the
circle
one
catches
sight
of
a
dozen
famous
volcanoes
all
more
or
less
capped
with
snow
almost
due
north
rises
the
bulk
of
cayambe
squatted
squarely
on
the
equator
perhaps
forty
miles
away
yet
seeming
just
over
the
ridge
beyond
the
city
near
it
jagged
cotacache
pierces
the
blue
heavens
further
around
comes
antisana
then
sincholagua
the
giant
that
not
many
years
ago
blew
its
head
off
in
a
fit
of
rage
to
the
east
stands
pasochoa
close
followed
by
rumiñaui
the
of
the

name
as
the
general
who
continued
the

against

spaniards
after
the
capture
of

peers
the
tip
of
cotapaxi
little
corazon
comes
next
with
iliniza
striving
in
vain
to
hide
behind
it
until
finally
the
eye
has
swung
back
to
the
broad
flanks
of
pichincha
up
which
clamber
indian
huts
like
captive
turtles
striving
to
escape
from
their
enclosing
basin
above
them
two
ragged
rock
and

peaks

streaked
with

invisible
from

forth
close
at

against
the
chill
of
the
upland

pichincha
is
rated
a
dead
volcano
having
given
no
signs
of
life
since
but
the
early
history
of
quito
is
strewn
with
its
ashes
and
destruction
quiteños
are
much
given
to
bewailing
their
triste
landscape
yet
few
of
her
canvases
has
nature
painted
with
so
masterly
a
hand
three
weeks
after
our
arrival
hays
burst
in
upon
me
one
morning
with
the
information
that
the
bundles
we
had
mailed
in
jirardot
had
come
well
on
in
the
afternoon
the
officials
saw
fit
to
lay
them
before
us
a
ragged
boy
cut
the
strings
and
spread
out
the
contents
for
customs
inspection
this
over
we
were
preparing
to
carry
them
off
when
we
were
halted
by
the
grunt
of
an
official
deep
in
some
long
arithmetical
process
at
a
nearby
desk
by
and
by
he
rose
and
pushed
toward
each
of
us
a
long
list
of
figures

i
began
scenting
a
long
controversy
true
you
surely
do
not
ask
us
to
pay
duty
on
personal
baggage
travelers
arrive
at
guayaquil
every
week
with
several
trunks
and
pay
no
only
that
is
baggage
which
the
traveler
personally
brings
in
with
him
the
charges
are
each
señores
since
the
parcels
are
of
the
same
but
you
can
see
for
yourself
that
they
are
marked
value
the
law
goes
by
weight
only
why
the
addition
the
new
law
requires
all
duties
to
be
levied
and
this
third
item
for
the
of
the
national
army
and
well
what
is
this
that
is
the
freight
from
but
the
postage
was
prepaid
from
jirardot
to
dollar
doesn
t

to
the

but
by
a
special
treaty
with

united
states
packages

this
the

bodega

but
the

came
through
in
a
without
so
much
as
entering
a
those
are
fixed
charges
irrespective
of
special
conditions
the
brokerage
covers

here
in
the
office
and
the
stamp
is
that
which
you
see
on
the
document
here
the
total
charges
are

growled
hays
turning
away
make
a
present
of
them
to
your
president
or
dress
up
one
of
your
statues
of
naturally
he
spoke
in
english
for
we
still
planned
to
live
some
time
in
quito
as
we
reached
the
door
a
word
from
the
official
caused
us
to
turn
back
he
was
up
to
his
ears
in
another
set
of
figures
we
can
call
it
cotton
instead
of
clothing
he
said
presenting
a
new
list
then
the
charges
will
be
only
make
it
clothing
suggested
hays
the
law
mentions
clothing
without
qualifications
replied
the
official
with
that
patient
courtesy
that
is
the
chief
virtue
of
his
race
the
bundles
do
not
weigh
that
anyway
i
persisted
most
of
it
is
in
the
the
law
specifies
bulk
not
net
keep
them
with
our
compliments
growled
hays
turning
away
i
ll
tell
you
what
you
can
do
señores
suggested
the
official
go
buy
a
stamped
sheet
of
government
paper
at
thirty
cents
and
write
the
director
of
why
can
t
we
write
him
on
ordinary
paper
it
would
not
be
legal
go
buy
a
stamped
paper
and
put
a
stamp
on
what
s
that
for
for
the
of
the
national
army
write
the
director
of
posts
reclaiming
the
duty
you
have
we
have
paid
it
cried
hays
hardly
i
have
had
too
much
experience
with
in
the
end
we
bought
the
stamped
paper
and
wrote
the
director
leaving
the
letter
with
the
official
who
promised
to
forward
it
to
his
as
the
bundles
contained
some
rather
indispensable
odds
and
ends
and
because
i
wished
to
investigate
ecuadorian
government
processes
to
the
bottom
i
followed
the
matter
up
next
day
we
called
twice
at
the
and
finally
late
in
the
afternoon
signed
a
blank
request
to
be
given
the
packages
duty
free
without
which
it
appeared
the
matter
could
not
be
officially
considered
two
days
later
we
were
informed
that
a
had
been
ordered
to
meet
and
pass
on
the
case
there
being
no
precedent
for
action
a
week
passed
the
junta
showed
no
ability
to
get
together
i
took
up
the
quest
spent
an
afternoon
in
gaining
admittance
to
the
sanctum
of
the
director
of
posts
he
was
courtesy
itself
but
the
gist
of
his
remarks
was
that
is
not
baggage
which
comes
in
by
mail
it
is
only
legally
so
when
it
crosses
the
frontier
with
its
owner
however
if
you
wish
you
might
call
on
the
minister
of
public
happens
to
be
also
at
the
present
time
acting
minister
of
the
interior
to
which
department
the
matter
ask
to
have
the
bundles
passed
as
i
spent
the
better
part
of
two
days
in
the
anteroom
of
the
ministry
a
sumptuous
pink
and
blue
adobe
chamber
with
a
score
of
bullet
holes
in
the
of
the
latest
request
of
the
populace
for
the
resignation
of
the
to
learn
the
law
mentions
no
difference
between
old
and
new
clothing
between
fresh
and
soiled
linen
all
clothing
entering
as
the
same
duty
hence
i
see
no
way
you
can
avoid
i
did
not
succeed
in
getting
the
matter
before
at
i
only
missed
taking
it
up
with
the
president
through
an
oversight
of
one
of
his
aids
in
the
end
i
paid
the
to
which
by
some
strange
manipulation
the
official
had
reduced
the
charges
and
carried
the
object
of
controversy
home
to
the
calle
flores
these
small
countries
of
tropical
america
remind
one
less
of
nations
than
of
groups
of
polite
bandits
who
have
taken
possession
of
a
few
mountains
and
valleys
that
they
may
levy
tribute
on
whoever
falls
into
their
hands
all
of
them
have
imitated
larger
powers
by
enacting
a
protective
tariff
without
even
the
scant
excuse
that
has
been
bloated
into
a
reason
for
it
in
other
lands
for
here
there
is
no
industry
to
here
it
is
not
the
lobbies
of
large
financial
interests
that
are
back
of
the
movement
but
the
politicians
who
constitute
the
government
the
tariffs
are
for
revenue
only
for
the
pockets
of
the
politicians
themselves
we
of
more
powerful
nations
hardly
realize
what
it
means
to
live
in
so
small
a
country
as
ecuador
until
it
is
brought
home
by
some
such
incident
as
hearing
the
entire
congress
debating
several
hours
on
the
question
of
whether
two
new
bulbs
shall
or
shall
not
be
placed
in
front
of
the
government
religiously
quito
is
still
in
the
middle
ages
looked
down
upon
from
any
point
of
vantage
it
has
the
aspect
of
an
ecclesiastical
capital
it
would
scarcely
be
an
exaggeration
to
say
that
half
the
city
is
taken
up
by
the
church
besides
its
many
bulking
temples
and
innumerable
chapels
enormous
sections
of
the
town
are
swallowed
up
within
the
confines
of
convents
and
monasteries
the
largest
is
san
francisco
reputed

in
on

floor
in

the
ink
with
which
the
city
was
founded
was
barely
dry
when
three
monks
of
that
order
arrived
afoot
and
breathless
from
guayaquil
to
be
given
an
immense
grant
of
land
running
far
up
the
flanks
of
pichincha
the
great
stone
cloisters
were
a
century
in
building
a
veritable
chinese
wall
of
brick
backed
by
clustered
hovels
of
the

would
have
been

to
continuing
to

it
aloft
until
the
command
was
obeyed

still
loll
under
such
withered
laurels
two
youths
of
quito
s
best
families
accompanied
me
to
san
francisco
a
monk
in
brown
greeted
my
companions
as
befitted
their
high
rank
and
potential
power
of
beneficence
yet
with
an
undercurrent
of
insincerity
and
of
dislike
for
these
sons
of
liberals
which
he
was
unable
wholly
to
conceal
we
passed
through
several
flowery
patios
musical
with
fountains
and
surrounded
by
pillared
arcades
off
which
opened
large
vaulted
chambers
to
an
elysian
orchard
under
the
trees
of
which
a
score
of
monks
strolled
in
pastoral
contentment
far
from
the
hubbub
and
cares
of
the
modern
world
cigarette
butts
littered
the
floor
of
a
kiosk
in
the
center
scarcely
a
face
was
to
be
seen
in
which
the
signs
of
frequent
debauch
could
not
plainly
be
read
the
walls
and
ceiling
of
the
adjoining
church
were
so
covered
with
gold
that
the
imagination
harked
back
to
the
ransom
of
atahuallpa
my
companions
whispered
that
an
american
had
recently
offered
for
the
privilege
of
removing
what
remained
of
the
genuine
metal
promising
to
regild
the
church
so
expertly
that
the
transaction
would
never
be
detected
the
offer
had
been
considered
but
declined
when
some
suspicion
of
the
deal
reached
the
public
ear
the
monks
were
still
open
to
similar
propositions
however
over
a
door
of
the
monastery
hung
an
old
painting
of
maría
dolorosa
by
a
famous
spanish
artist
one
of
my
companions
himself
a
painter
of
some
ability
offered
a
tempting
sum
for
permission
to
replace
the
dusty
old
thing
with
a
brand
new
copy
and
the
impression
left
by
a
deal
of
murmuring
and
pantomime
was
that
the
offer
would
eventually
be
accepted

gave
us

permitted

a
few
months
before
several
young
men
of
the
class
had
formed
a
conspiracy
to
taste
the
unknown
luxury
of
one
night
of
unbroken
slumber
gaining
admission
on
various
pretexts
to
all
the
of
the

the
conspirators
had
stolen
the

believe
we
call
them
in
got
rid
of
them
so
effectually
that
few
were
ever
discovered
the
priests
were
their
faithful
henchmen

replaced

they
quickly
overcame
the
handicap
they
established
the
first

and
brooked
no
competition
besides
enormous
tracts
of
the
most
fertile
land
in
the
colony
they
were
granted
a
monopoly
of

free
from
taxes

necessity
of
paying
the
king

share
and
holding

at
less
than
a
nominal
wage
most
of
which
returned
to
their
coffers

the
form

easily
choked

fearlessly

it

at

one
enterprising
pupil
found
it
possible
to
work
his

through
the
of

the
rules
of

the

little

that
of

be
surmised

the
fact
that
in

they
held

suggestive
of
local
conditions
soon
after
its
erection
an
indian
living
far
up
the
mountainside
above
the
suburb
of
guarico
lost
his
pig
he
tried
every
known
means
of
recovering
the
animal
to
every
available
saint
with
any
reputation
for
miracles
squandered
his
meager
substance
in
burning
candles
before
every
shrine
in
quito
and
purchased
many
a
priestly
prayer
all
in
vain
the
pig
was
not
to
be
found
at
length
a
a
wag
or
a
sincere
believer
is
not
to
the
distracted
indian
that
the
most
powerful
saint
of
all
was
the
new
one
in
the
plaza
santo
domingo
the
credulous
fellow
lost
no
time
on
his
way
to
the
square
where
he
knelt
with
a
lighted
candle
on
either
side
of
him
before
the
pedestal
of
the
hero
of
ayacucho
when
he
looked
up
from
his
first
invocation
he
noted
that
the
statue
was
pointing
to
the
battlefield
on
which
its
original
defeated
the
spaniards
far
up
the
slope
of
pichincha
which
chanced
also
to
be
the
location
of
the
indian
s
hut
he
hurried
homeward
and
sure
enough
found
the
pig
in
a
hollow
not
far
from
his
dwelling
since
then
saint
sucre
has
had
a
great
vogue
with
the
indian
populace
of
quito
it
would
be
out
of
place
to
enumerate
the
many
proofs
from
personal
experiences
to
matters
of
common
knowledge
from
national
literature
to
frequent
notorious
scandals
of
the
moral
laxity
of
the
quiteño
priesthood
whatever
they
may
be
elsewhere
celibacy
and
the
confessional
are
undeniably
institutions
for
a
race
of
ecuadorian
caliber
the
would
not
dream
of
berating
the
churchmen
in
any
such
terms
as
those
which
frequently
fall
from
the
lips
of
educated
men
of
quito
more
than
once
i
have
heard
a
devout
quiteña
mother
bewail
the
fact
that
she
dare
not
send
her
daughter
to
confession
though
convinced
that
the
ceremony
was
requisite
to
the
saving
of
her
soul
one
looks
in
vain
for
any
connection
whatever
between
religion
and
morality
in
this
typical
andean
capital
the
sanctimonious
old
wrapped
in
their
black
mantos
who
haunt
the
churches
and
accompany
every
religious
procession
with
tears
of
hysterical
ecstasy
coursing
down
their
cheeks
are
not
infrequently
procurers
and
of
the
human
vultures
that
dwell
in
as
well
as
out
of
the
monasteries
the
of
quito
are
almost
all
fervent
scores
of
the
same
faces
that
peer
invitingly
out
upon
the
passerby
at
night
may
be
seen
next
morning
kneeling
on
the
pavement
of
the
cathedral
or
walking
on
their
knees
around
the
entire
circle
of
plaster
saints
reciting
a
prayer
formula
before
each
nor
is
this
hypocrisy
these
victims
see
no
incongruity
between
the
evening
s
doings
and
the
morning
s
occupation
to
the
masses
religion
is
a
mixture
of
idol
worship
and
the
performance
of
fixed
ceremonies
wholly
divorced
from
their
personal
actions
the
sins
of
daily
life
are
wiped
out
by
a
in
the
confessional
absolution
is
granted
for
the
payment
of
a
fee
and
the
performance
of
a
set
devotion
the
brain
cells
where
real
morality
might
find
a
foothold
are
packed
with
absurd
catechisms
that
leave
no
room
for
it
and
of
religion
there
remains
nothing
but
unthinking
and
unreasoning
fanaticism
quito
has
been
called
the
most
fanatical
town
of
south
america
among
a
score
like
it
the
present
archbishop
tells
the
following
story
in
his
history
of
about
two
hundred
years
ago
some
one
broke
into
one
of
the
churches
and
stole
the
sacred
wafers
together
with
the
gold
ciborium
in
which
they
were
kept
a
few
days
later
the
stolen
property
was
found
lying
in
the
refuse
of
a
ditch
amid
great
weeping
a
procession
of
the
entire
population
bore
the
sacred
emblem
back
to
its
church
for
weeks
the
whole
town
dressed
in
deepest
mourning
the
gave
all
its
attention
and
the
police
force
all
its
efforts
to
running
down
those
vile
traitors
bestial
swine
and
venial
sinners
as
the
gentle
archbishop
calls
them
leaving
little
misdemeanors
like
robbery
and
murder
to
look
after
themselves
not
a
clue
was
uncovered
at
length
a
famous
jesuit
of
the
time
preached
a
sermon
that
lashed
the
populace
into
such
fervor
that
the
congregation
poured
forth
into
the
streets
beating
themselves
with
chains
and
scourges
most
of
them
men
and
women
naked
to
the
am
quoting
the
a
procession
and
religious
fury
that
lasted
from
eight
at
night
until
two
in
the
morning
a
scapegoat
was
imperative
the
officers
of
the
in
peril
of
being
themselves
forced
to
assume
that
rôle
redoubled
their
efforts
and
at
length
found
some
distance
south
of
the
city
three
indians
and
a
who
were
reputed
to
have
confessed
to
the
nefarious
crime
the
four
miscreants
were
brought
back
to
the
city
kicked
about
the
streets
by
the
populace
trussed
up
in
chains
in
the
church
while
the
priest
preached
a
sermon
on
the
most
atrocious
crime
in
the
history
of
quito
and
were
finally
hanged
drawn
and
quartered
and
hung
up
still
dripping
with
blood
in
sixteen
parts
of
the
town
the
priests
and
their
followers
dug
up
a
potful
of
earth
where
the
holy
wafers
had
been
found
and
deposited
it
in
a
heavy
vase
of
solid
gold
that
is
still
one
of
the
precious
relics
of
the
cathedral
then
they
caused
to
be
erected
over
the
spot
the
chapel
of
jerusalem
where
it
stands
to
this
day
and
adds
the
archbishop
no
faithful
one
will
deny
that
they
met
their
just
fate
for
so
vile
and
unprecedented
a
illustration
a
corner
of
through
a
into
one
of
the
many
ravines
by
which
the
city
is
broken
up
ah
but
that
was
two
centuries
ago
true
but
permit
me
to
bring
the
fanaticism
of
quito
up
to
date
less
than
a
year
before
our
arrival
the
perennial
struggle
between
the
liberals
and
the
conservatives
the
latter
the
church
party
had
broken
out
again
in
revolution
a
little
man
with
a
white
goatee
sprouting
from
a
chin
and
wearing
habitually
a
hat
that
would
have
been
the
envy
of
a
comedian
had
for
years
been
president
of
ecuador
he
had
stolen
unusually
little
for
a
president
and
had
not
allowed
his
friends
to
steal
more
than
the
average
moreover
he
had
done
the
country
much
service
among
other
things
having
induced
an
american
to
complete
the
railroad
from
the
coast
to
quito
also
he
had
curtailed
some
of
the
unbridled
graft
of
the
church
and
strangely
enough
the
church
had
resented
that
species
of
reform
and
turned
the
power
of
the
conservatives
against
him
to
be
sure
the
queer
little
man
had
objected
to
surrendering
his
office
to
a
newly
elected
incumbent
but
that
is
a
common
south
american
peccadillo
when
the
populace
rose
and
drove
him
out
he
went
down
to
the
coast
and
gathered
an
army
of
his
but
luck
had
deserted
him
after
a
few
battles
he
was
captured
together
with
several
sons
nephews
and
henchmen
the
conservatives
were
triumphant
the
government
ordered
the
captives
to
be
sent
up
to
quito
the
general
in
command
at
guayaquil
protested
that
such
action
was
unsafe
until
the
fury
of
the
populace
evaporated
the
government
assured
him
the
danger
was
visionary
and
repeated
the
order
a
special
train
was
made
up
and
set
out
on
the
long
climb
to
the
plateau
that
was
on
a
saturday
next
morning
a
priest
noted
for
his
virulent
eloquence
preached
a
sermon
that
lashed
the
masses
into
fury
at
noon
word
came
that
the
train
had
arrived
and
the
prisoners
hurried
by
automobile
to
the
panóptico
the
penitentiary
up
on
the
lower
flanks
of
pichincha
the
populace
quickly
gathered
the
through
the
false
stone
walls
of
the
dismal
little
mud
cells
in
the
narrow
corners
of
which
the
prisoners
crouched
were
still
fresh
when
we
wandered
through
the
place
months
later
among
the
most
fanatical
of
the
mob
were
the
police
and
those
whose
duty
it
was
to
guard
the
prison
in
the
excitement
some
twoscore
prisoners
escaped
and
joined
the
rioters
the
little
and
his
companions
dead
or
dying
were
stripped
naked
ropes
were
tied
to
their
ankles
and
they
were
dragged
for
hours
through
the
cobbled
streets
of
quito
the
frenzied
populace
raising
the
echoes
of
the
surrounding
ranges
with
shouts
of

of

later
my

as
the
bodies

his

were
passing

to
be
seen
on
through
the
entire
length
of
the
city
the
barbaric
procession
continued
near
the
plaza
san
blas
a
swarm
of
the
lowest
women
in
town
descended
with
knives
from
their
hovels
and
carried
off
gruesome
mementoes
of
the
orgy
at
length
the
mob
reached
the
ejido
the
broad
green
playground
of
quito
where
they
hacked
in
pieces
the
bodies
of
the
victims
with
machetes
and
whatever
implement
came
to
hand
some
carried
to
their
huts
as
souvenirs
the
heads
of
the
and
his
sons
from
which
they
were
recovered
with
difficulty
only
after
the
frenzy
had
died
down
and
been
slept
off
the
rest
was
piled
in
heaps
and
burned
such
were
the
draggings
to
which
the

yet
chiefly
a
void
in
place
of
what
in

would
be

the

is
divided
rather
sharply
between

on

those
who
remain

either
indian

depending
on

don

hurry
a
quiteño
told
me
in
all
seriousness
one
day
people
will
think
you
are
busy
that
is
with
vulgar
work
it
is
customary
to
raise
one
s
hat
to
every
male
acquaintance
of
your
own
class
or
above
to
pause
and
shake
hands
with
every
one
considered
your
equal
to
ask
him
how
he
has
dawned
to
inquire
after
his
family
individually
and
to
shake
hands
again
before
parting
and
that
as
often
as
you
meet
him
though
it
be
every
during
the
day
americans
who
have
lived
long
in
south
america
have
the
habit
chronically
the
greeting
or
more
exactly
the
acknowledgment
of
the
greeting
of
one
s
inferior
varies
from
a
patronizing
heartiness
to
the
corner
tailor
to
a
grunt
to
an
indian
the
latter
is
always
addressed
in
the
tu
form
because
as
one
of
my
beau
brummel
acquaintances
put
it
there
is
no
reason
whatever
to
show
any
respect
to
the
during
several
months
acquaintance
i
found
no
great
reason
to
show
any
to
the
speaker
but
that
perhaps
is
beside
the
point
how
wholly
lacking
the
place
is
in
genuine
democracy
is
frequently
illustrated
i
was
strolling
in
the
one
day
for
instance
with
the
grandson
of
the
washington
of
ecuador
a
youth
of
american
school
training
and
of
unusually
high
standards
when
he
stepped
on
the
flagging
surrounding
the
central
monument
the
cholo
policeman
on
guard
hesitated
but
finally
screwed
up
unusual
courage
and
informed
the
youth
in
a
courteous
not
to
say
humble
manner
that
he
had
been
ordered
not
to
let
any
one
walk
on
the
flagging
the
descendant
of
ecuador
s
founder
turned
a
brilliant
red
as
if
his
noble
house
had
been
vilely
insulted
then
so
white
that
his
blond
hair
seemed
to
become
dark
brown
he
strode
across
to
the
officer
who
was
considerably
larger
than
he
caught
him
by
the
coat
and
all
but
jerked
him
off
his
feet
the
policeman
abjectly
apologized
the
best
people
of
quito
do
not
realize
that
it
is
not
the
individual
policeman
their
inferior
giving
them
orders
but
lawful
and
orderly
society
speaking
through
him
as
in
the
days
of
stevenson
s
travels
a
century
ago
the
principal
occupation
of
persons
of
rank
is
visiting
their
estates
particularly
at
by
far
the
greater
portion
of
the
year
they
spend
in
town
however
leaving
their
haciendas
in
charge
of
little
acquainted
with
modern
agricultural
methods
the
city
has
so
few
recreative
attractions
that
it
is
hard
for
a
man
of
education
to
avoid
a
more
or
less
studious
life
be
it
only
as
a
pastime
yet
quito
does
not
even
aspire
to
rival
bogotá
as
the
athens
of
south
ecuador
is
not
without
her
literature
but
it
has
come
from
other
towns
more
frequently
than
from
the
capital
the
game
of
politics
not
without
its
perils
engrosses
the
attention
of
many
then
as
in
most
countries
not
a
few
dissipate
their
energies
in
the
pursuit
of
pleasure
of
a
rather
specific
kind
so
assiduously
does
the
average
quiteño
devote
himself
to
this
from
early
youth
that
it
is
not
strange
that
an
old
man
of
the
class
is
rarely
seen
there
is
a
considerable
provincialism
even
among
the
best
educated
classes
i
heard
often
such
questions
as
what
is
a
sleigh
when
is
summer
the
story
is
well
vouched
for
that
a
congressman
asked
a
colleague
just
back
from
abroad
can
a
man
get
to
europe
in
three
weeks
on
a
good
mule
the
women
of
the
class
in
quito
are
less
given
to
the
display
of
mustaches
than
those
of
bogotá
not
a
few
are
distinctly
attractive
particularly
in
early
youth
in
later
life
too
many
suggest
in
their
features
some
years
of
a
rather
harrowing
existence
outspoken
quiteños
lay
this
condition
at
the
door
of
the
priests
and
friars
but
mere
economic
pressure
probably
plays
at
least
as
considerable
a
part
the
of
so
many
enormous
ecclesiastical
institutions
can
not
but
drain
the
resources
of
so
stagnant
a
city
wealth
does
not
abound
and
feminine
opportunity
to
earn
a
livelihood
is
narrowly
restricted
it
is
not
strange
then
if
more
than
one
family
still
rated
in
the
gentle
decente
class
remains
with
no
other
barrier
against
starvation
than
the
youthful
freshness
of
its
daughters
in
most
parts
of
the
world
a
glance
suffices
to
distinguish
a
woman
of
public
life
from
her
respected
sisters
in
quito
it
is
not
so
easy
indeed
there
seems
to
be
no
hard
and
fast
line
between
the
two
classes
certain
undercurrents
suggest
a
tacit
admission
that
some
families
have
only
one
means
of
tiding
over
their
existence
until
a
lucky
turn
of
politics
or
of
the
lottery
wheel
sets
them
on
their
feet
again
then
if
the
girl
s
career
has
not
been
too
public
she
may
be
bestowed
on
a
husband
of
a
somewhat
lower
social
level
let
me
not
leave
the
impression
of
a
general
laxity
among
the
women
of
quito
the
sheltered
daughters
of
the
most
responsible
classes
are
models
of
modesty
and
domesticity
but
he
who
dwells
any
length
of
time
in
the
city
would
be
blind
to
overlook
certain
facts
be
they
the
result
of
an
impoverished
society
or
more
directly
fostered
by
those
ecclesiastical
elements
to
whom
the
embittered
men
of
higher
rank
charge
them
thus
far
i
have
said
little
of
the
if
not
most
numerous
at
least
most
conspicuous
class
in
quito
indians
ignoring
the
very
considerable
number
in
whose
veins
runs
a
greater
or
less
percentage
of
aboriginal
blood
those
in
whom
it
is
still
without
admixture
make
up
perhaps
forty
per
cent
of
the
population
and
give
the
city
most
of
its
color
there
is
not
a
house
in
town
from
the
adobe
dwelling
of
the
president
down
without
its
indians
servants
and
huddled
in
the
mud
cells
about
the
cobbled
patio
of
the
lower
story
or
homeless
wretches
who
lie
by
night
in
any
unoccupied
corner
and
pick
up
a
precarious
existence
by
day
in
competition
with
donkeys
and
their
kennels
form
the
of
almost
every
street
they
scatter
out
along
all
the
highways
and
dot
the
flanks
of
every
range
and
mountain
spur
in
the
vicinity
if
they
have
changed
since
the
conquest
it
is
for
the
worse
in
habits
and
condition
they
vary
scarcely
at
all
from
those
of
the
dreary
andean
villages
through
which
we
had
passed
theirs
is
a
purely
animal
existence
they
have
not
the
faintest
notion
of
any
line
between
filth
and
cleanliness
avoiding
only
that
which
is
obviously
poison
by
an
instinct
common
to
the
lower
animals
i
have
seen
them
drink
water
i
am
sure
a
thirsty
horse
would
not
touch
and
that
despite
the
fact
that
fresh
water
was
to
be
had
a
few
yards
away
they
literally
never
wash
so
much
as
a
finger
except
on
some
such
occasion
as
a
church
fiesta
when
they
may
pause
at
a
pool
or
on
the
edge
of
town
to
scrub
their
feet
with
a
stone
they
speak
a
debauched
dialect
of
quichua
the
tongue
of
the
incas
mixed
with
some
words
of
the
conquered
caras
though
all
understand
spanish
or
at
least
the
spoken
in
quito
illustration
after
the
bullfight
a
yearling
is
often
turned
into
the
ring
for
the
amusement
of
the
youthful
male
population
of
quito
illustration
a
group
of
the
indians
that
form
so
large
a
percentage
of
quito
s
population
the
hats
are
light
gray
the
ponchos
skirts
and
shawls
each
some
crude
brilliant
color
many
consider
the
andean
indian
a
debased
mongolian
type
a
theory
not
without
its
basis
in
his
features
in
a
curious
old
book
of
the
national
library
of
history
of
the
kingdom
of
quito
written
in
the
jesuit
padre
velasco
takes
up
the
question
of
the
origin
of
the
indian
and
settles
least
to
his
own
satisfaction
to
begin
with
the
church
has
declared
the
inhabitants
of
the
new
world
rational
that
is
descended
from
adam
and
eve
that
point
being
disposed
of
it
follows
that
the
men
and
animals
who
were
found
in
america
must
be
descendants
of
those
who
emerged
from
noah
s
ark
for
does
not
the
bible
say
that
the
world
was
covered
with
water
even
granted
for
the
sake
of
argument
continues
the
padre
that
the
mountains
of
south
america
protruded
a
bit
above
the
surface
of
those
waters
is
it
conceivable
that
man
could
live
for
months
on
the
highest
peaks
eating
snow
drinking
snow
and
sleeping
in
snow
could
he
even
have
stood
up
for
nearly
a
year
on
those
pyramids
of
snow
and
ice
i
give
it
up
ask
some
polar
explorer
what
then
remains
of
the
argument
of
those
who
still
cling
to
the
authoctonomous
heresy
obviously
there
is
no
other
recourse
then
to
admit
that
the
ancestors
of
the
race
found
their
way
to
america
by
the
behring
strait
or
across
the
pacific
from
the
shores
of
asia
whatever
his
origin
the
indian
of
the
andes
is
a
distinct
reality
distinct
indeed
to
all
the
five
senses
and
he
varies
little
throughout
the
length
of
the
continent
in
build
he
is
stocky
and
short
very
muscular
with
the
strength
of
a
mule
for
carrying
loads
on
his
back
indefatigable
on
foot
but
weak
for
other
labor
his
color
is
between
a
tarnished
copper
and
a
more
or
less
intense
bronze
his
head
is
large
his
neck
thick
and
long
his
eyes
small
black
and
penetrating
yet
at
times
strangely
suggesting
those
of
a
dead
fish
his
nose
is
bulky
and
somewhat
flattened
and
spread
his
teeth
are
white
even
and
always
in
splendid
condition
his
long
hair
worn
sometimes
flying
loose
sometimes
in
a
single
braid
wound
with
red
tape
is
without
luster
abundant
perfectly
straight
strong
and
coarse
as
that
of
a
horse
s
mane
without
even
a
tendency
to
baldness
his
lips
are
thick
and
heavy
the
lower
one
somewhat
hanging
giving
him
a
suggestion
of
sulkiness
his
forehead
is
low
his
mouth
large
and
his
prominent
and
large
ears
give
his
face
an
appearance
of
great
width
he
is
with
a
chest
like
a
barrel
but
slender
of
leg
and
small
of
foot
he
grows
no
beard
and
has
almost
no
hair
on
the
body
men
and
women
alike
except
a
rare
male
with
a
sole
of
leather
secured
by
thongs
are
at
least
halfway
to
the
knees
their
feet
like
calloused
hoofs
marked
by
stony
trails
and
years
of
barnyard
wallowing
the
male
wears
a
broad
round
hat
of
thick
felt
a
kind
of
pajama
shirt
or
blouse
of
fancily
colored
calico
or
a
very
roomy
pair
of
panties
of
thinnest
white
cotton
that
reach
anywhere
from
his
knees
to
halfway
to
his
undomesticated
feet
besides
these
garments
he
is
never
seen
without
his
ruana
or
poncho
which
serves
him
as
a
cloak
and
by
day
and
as
a
bed
and
covering
by
night
this
is
always
of
some
startling
crude
color
deep
red
predominating
with
such
screaming
combinations
as
magenta
and
purple
carmine
and
yellow
though
when
sufficiently
soiled
and
the
old
rose
and
velvety
brown
the
brick
red
or
turquoise
blue
take
on
all
the
soft
richness
of
oriental
rugs
it
is
this
commonly
homespun
garment
and
the
corresponding
one
of
the
women
that
make
quito
such
a
city
the
woman
too
copies
the
dress
of
her
ancestors
to
remote
generations
she
wears
the
same
hat
as
the
are
unknown
to
her
all
down
the
beltless
waist
of
coarse
cloth
either
open
or
thin
and
ragged
several
strips
of
colored
a
woolish
shoddy
wrapped
tightly
around
her
hips
from
waist
to
calves
in
guise
of
skirt
always
slit
open
on
one
side
showing
an
inner
sometimes
in
striking
solid
colors
in
marked
contrast
to
the
outer
skirt
and
a
blanket
smaller
but
as
audible
in
hue
as
the
poncho
of
the
male
thrown
round
her
shoulders
like
a
shawl
she
is
fond
of
gaudy
earrings
of
colored
glass
or
similar
rubbish
ranging
in
size
from
large
to
colossal
from
one
to
a
dozen
strings
of
cheap
red
beads
often
the
bean
of
a
wild
plant
indigenous
to
the
region
hang
around
her
neck
generally
brass
rings
adorn
every
finger
and
often
many
beads
are
wound
round
and
round
her
bare
arms
she
is
completely
devoid
of
feminine
charm
she
needs
none
for
she
is
amply
worth
her
keep
as
a
beast
of
burden
as
far
as
i
know
there
is
no
law
in
quito
requiring
an
indian
woman
not
to
be
seen
without
a
babe
in
arms
or
rather
in
shawl
but
if
one
exists
it
is
seldom
violated
in
an
hour
i
have
seen
by
actual
count
more
than
three
hundred
female
aborigines
pass
my
window
in
the
calle
flores
and
not
a
score
of
them
but
bore
on
her
back
a
child
of
from
two
weeks
to
two
years
of
age
to
say
nothing
of
several
other
bundles
and
her
whirling
spindle
when
the
infant
is
tiny
it
is
carried
lengthwise
at
the
bottom
of
the
knotted
across
the
mother
s
chest
when
it
is
older
it
is
tossed
or
climbs
astride
her
broad
back
lying
face
down
with
legs
spread
while
she
throws
her
outer
garment
about
it
ties
the
knot
on
her
on
her
forehead
if
the
child
is
trots
along
at
her
work
the
day
through
without
the
least
apparent
notice
of
the
offspring
the
babe
falls
asleep
or
gazes
with
curious
yet
rather
dull
eyes
at
the
world
as
it
speeds
by
peering
over
the
mother
s
shoulder
like
an
engineer
from
his
cab
eats
such
food
or
refuse
as
falls
into
its
hands
or
plays
with
the
mother
s
braid
the
indian
woman
never
carries
her
offspring
in
any
other
manner
unless
in
her
rôle
as
a
common
carrier
she
picks
up
a
load
too
bulky
or
heavy
to
place
the
infant
atop
such
as
a
bedstead
a
bureau
or
two
sacks
of
are
not
exaggerations
but
frequent
she
hangs
the
child
in
front
in
the
concave
of
her
figure
like
a
baby
kangaroo
in
the
maternal
pouch
knotting
the
supporting
garment
across
her
shoulders
the
youngest
baby
is
already
inconceivably
dirty
yet
almost
always
robustly
healthy
in
appearance
though
the
infant
mortality
of
the
class
is
appalling
it
is
an
unusual
experience
to
hear
an
indian
baby
cry
from
its
earliest
years
it
seems
to
adopt
that
uncomplaining
attitude
toward
life
that
is
so
marked
a
characteristic
of
the
adults
though
she
treats
her
offspring
with
no
active
all
the
years
i
spent
in
south
america
i
have
never
seen
an
indian
mother
strike
a
aboriginal
woman
seems
to
endure
it
passively
like
any
other
burden
thrust
upon
her
from
which
there
is
no
escape
carrying
it
where
it
will
be
least
troublesome
and
never
at
least
openly
showing
any
caressing
fondness
for
it
the
child
old
enough
to
toddle
about
the
streets
often
remains
on
the
mother
s
back
as
if
to
hold
the
place
for
the
next
comer
it
is
a
common
experience
to
hear
an
indian
child
ask
in
a
perfectly
fluent
tongue
for
a
serving
at
the
maternal
source
of
supply
there
is
scant
difference
in
appearance
between
the
two
sexes
and
none
whatever
in
their
labor
except
that
if
there
is
only
one
load
the
woman
carries
it
and
the
baby
in
addition
in
both
the
and
indian
classes
the
women
are
more
uncleanly
than
the
men
like
the
latter
they
work
at
all
the
coarser
unskilled
tasks
shoveling
earth
mixing
and
carrying
mortar
cobbling
streets
while
in
the
matters
of
loads
there
is
nothing
under
two
hundred
pounds
in
weight
which
once
on
their
backs
they
can
not
jog
along
under
at
a
kind
of
limping
gait
that
seems
tireless
almost
any
day
the
furniture
and
entire
possessions
of
some
moving
household
is
displayed
to
public
gaze
as
it
jogs
through
town
on
the
backs
of
an
indian
family
the
chief
of
quito
is
a
constant
string
of
indians
from
the
fountain
opposite
the
government
palace
with
huge
red
earthen
jars
sitting
on
their
hips
and
supported
by
a
thong
across
the
forehead
it
is
a
commonplace
to
meet
an
indian
carrying
the
gaudy
image
of
some
saint
larger
than
himself
cheap
coffins
of
boards
painted
or
pink
and
decorated
with
strips
of
gilded
paper
frequently
mince
past
secured
by
the
brilliant
poncho
of
the
carrier
knotted
across
his
chest
i
had
occasion
one
day
to
transport
a
typewriter
a
few
blocks
the
indian
prepared
to
sling
it
on
his
back
with
a
rope
when
i
objected
to
this
method
i
found
that
the
fellow
not
only
could
not
carry
it
in
his
hands
but
that
he
could
not
lift
it
to
his
head
when
i
placed
it
there
however
he
ambled
away
as
if
he
had
nothing
on
his
mind
but
his
hat
frequently
an
entire
family
takes
a
large
job
such
as
carrying
a
building
from
one
end
of
town
to
another
adobe
brick
by
brick
such
a
one
passed
my
window
for
weeks
all
day
long
they
back
and
forth
in
single
file
along
the
line
of
flagstones
in
the
middle
of
the
street
their
bare
feet
making
absolutely
no
sound
never
a
word
or
a
sign
of
complaint
finding
outward
expression
the
man
and
woman
each
bore
the
same
number
of
mud
bricks
piled
on
their
backs
and
the
latter
always
carried
the
baby
in
her
pouch
though
they
made
a
hundred
trips
a
day
why
the
infant
could
not
have
been
left
at
one
end
or
the
other
of
the
journey
it
was
hard
to
guess
two
children
one
a
little
fellow
of
five
with
one
brick
on
his
back
his
brother
of
seven
or
eight
with
two
toiled
all
day
long
between
father
and
mother
as
if
they
were
being
systematically
trained
for
the
only
life
before
them
the
andean
indian
is
even
less
like
the
tall
and
haughty
redskin
of
our
country
in
manner
than
in
appearance
compared
with
him
the
mexican
indian
is
bold
and
ferocious
silent
and
abstracted
he
takes
no
apparent
heed
of
what
goes
on
about
him
of
phlegmatic
temperament
a
truly
wooden
equanimity
of
temper
melancholy
taciturn
and
reserved
he
is
noted
above
all
for
a
distrust
that
is
perhaps
natural
but
is
more
likely
the
result
of
centuries
of
privations
since
the
coming
of
the
spaniards
he
has
a
blind
submission
to
authority
great
attachment
to
the
house
in
which
he
lives
and
is
so
cowardly
that
he
lets
himself
be
dominated
by
the
most
despicable
members
of
other
races
a
complete
outsider
in
government
and
public
affairs
he
is
treated
by
the
rest
of
the
population
like
a
domestic
animal
the
merchant
of
quito
who
requires
a
carrier
to
deliver
some
bundle
does
not
wait
for
one
to
offer
himself
he
steps
into
the
street
and
snatches
the
first
indian
who
passes
though
he
be
on
his
way
to
a
dying
parent
or
preparing
his
child
s
funeral
and
the
indian
performs
the
task
as
uncomplainingly
as
some
mechanical
device
and
returns
to
wait
perhaps
an
hour
or
two
for
the
few
cents
the
merchant
chooses
to
give
him
only
when
he
is
drunk
does
the
aboriginal
s
manner
change
then
he
is
garrulous
and
mildly
disorderly
but
even
on
a
saturday
afternoon
when
the
highways
are
lined
with
indians
of
both
sexes
reeling
homeward
the
gringo
passes
unnoticed
in
marked
contrast
with
the
gantlet
of
insolence
if
not
indeed
of
actual
danger
which
he
must
run
under
like
circumstances
in
the
highlands
of
mexico
the
newcomer
s
sympathy
for
the
indian
of
quito
gradually
evaporates
with
the
discovery
that
he
is
utterly
devoid
of
ambition
as
completely
indifferent
to
his
own
betterment
as
any
animal
pad
out
this
fact
with
all
its
details
and
ramifications
discarding
entirely
the
american
s
ingrown
tendency
to
imbue
every
human
being
with
a
striving
character
and
the
hopelessness
of
the
indian
s
condition
will
be
more
clearly
realized
the
government
of
ecuador
gives
scant
attention
to
the
education
of
the
aboriginals
even
if
it
provided
schools
and
forced
attendance
there
would
still
remain
the
problem
of
arousing
in
these
people
any
interest
in
or
effort
for
a
simple
episode
will
go
far
toward
visualizing
the
temperament
of
the
indian
of
quito
and
perhaps
make
a
bit
clearer
the
ease
with
which
pizarro
and
his
handful
of
tramps
overthrew
the
empire
of
the
incas
i
had
gone
out
for
a
stroll
one
afternoon
along
the
road
to
guallabamba
some
three
miles
from
town
a
light
rain
turned
me
back
there
were
no
houses
near
but
numbers
of
indians
were
going
and
coming
a
short
distance
ahead
was
a
group
engaged
in
noisy
contention
suddenly
a
handsome
muscular
young
indian
broke
away
and
ran
toward
me
his
long
black
hair
streaming
out
behind
him
at
his
heels
cursing
came
three
cholos
in
the
dark
hats
more
sober
blankets
and
trousers
of
their
caste
with
shorn
hair
and
straggling
suggestions
of
mustaches
i
was
not
does
not
trouble
to
carry
weapons
about
in
my
bespattered
road
garb
i
had
certainly
no
appearance
of
protective
authority
when
he
reached
me
however
the
frightened
indian
instead
of
running
on
turned
as
sharply
as
about
a
corner
and
pattered
along
close
at
my
heels
breathing
quickly
i
continued
my
stroll
while
the
drunken
far
more
muscular
than
i
hovered
about
ten
steps
in
the
rear
crying
ah
coward
you
run
to
the
señor
for
protection
yet
not
a
step
nearer
did
they
approach
during
the
furlong
or
more
that
the
procession
lasted
then
as
we
passed
the
entrance
to
an
hacienda
the
indian
suddenly
sprinted
away
up
its
avenue
of
faster
than
the
cholos
could
follow
when
they
overtook
me
again
one
protested
in
plaintive
tones
ah
señor
sinvergüenza
de
did
not
deserve
your
then
they
fell
behind
while
i
who
had
been
an
entirely
passive
actor
in
all
the
scene
strolled
on
into
the
city
it
would
be
hard
to
imagine
a
similar
incident
in
mexico
this
indian
s
older
daughter
knocked
at
my
door
one
day
to
say
that
as
it
was
don
panchito
s
birthday
the
celebration
in
the
next
my
own
room
would
probably
keep
me
awake
all
night
anyway
and
had
i
not
better
join
the
party
by
eight
the
beating
of
the
piano
had
begun
when
i
appeared
don
panchito
took
me
on
a
tour
of
the
guests
seated
in
solemn
quadrangle
around
the
four
walls
of
the
room
the
sexes
segregated
the
south
american
has
a
custom
which
might
well
be
imported
into
our
own
land
to
the
relief
of
frequent
embarrassment
as
he
was
introduced
each
man
rose
bowed
profoundly
and
announced
his
own
name
in
tones
enrique
burgos
de
perez
y
silva
servidor
de
the
women
remained
seated
but
made
their
names
similarly
known
a
professional
pianist
a
patched
dishevelled
and
young
man
of
some
indian
blood
had
already
begun
a
very
nearly
continuous
performance
at
fast
time
with
barely
intervals
between
the
dances
in
a
corner
sat
motionless
all
the
evening
two
professional
don
panchito
was
a
old
women
of
none
too
immaculate
habits
wrapped
in
black
mantos
from
which
only
nose
and
eyes
protruded
there
were
no
dance
cards
each
pair
started
in
or
stopped
when
they
saw
fit
quite
irrespective
of
the
others
a
man
stepped
across
the
room
held
out
his
gloved
right
hand
to
a
girl
without
a
word
and
she
rose
to
accept
an
invitation
that
apparently
could
not
be
least
not
one
failed
to
accept
it
though
some
of
the
more
attractive
were
led
out
upon
the
floor
at
least
fifty
times
in
the
course
of
the
evening
evidently
it
was
bad
form
to
carry
on
a
conversation
out
of
hearing
of
the
chaperon
neither
dancer
visibly
spoke
a
word
until
the
girl
wished
to
stop
when
she
murmured
gracias
and
was
at
once
returned
in
silence
to
her
seat
as
the
evening
wore
on
several
young
fops
dropped
in
alleging
conflicting
engagements
as
an
excuse
for
their
tardiness
and
joined
the
celebration
without
removing
their
lavender
gloves
which
indeed
the
chilliness
of
the
room
pardoned
one
of
the
newcomers
in
particular
stirred
up
the
ladies
to
almost
human
expressions
of
interest
he
was
son
of
the
minister
of
the
interior
just
back
from
paris
and
lost
no
opportunity
to
display
the
wisdom
he
had
gleaned
in
the
capital
of
the
world
rather
french
and
an
authoritative
knowledge
of
new
and
more
complicated
manners
of
hopping
about
the
floor
to
music
at
frequent
intervals
our
indian
slavey
mercedes
familiarly
known
as
meech
arrived
with
fiery
drinks
in
which
we
toasted
don
panchito
even
the
young
girls
tossing
it
off
without
a
tear
at
midnight
the
festival
raged
at
its
height
at
one
o
clock
we
sat
down
to
dinner
in
a
temperature
far
from
agreeable
to
those
of
us
who
did
not
dance
then
the
celebration
broke
out
anew
though
the
chaperons
and
pianist
and
even
don
panchito
had
disappeared
the
young
fops
removed
their
gloves
and
took
turns
on
the
stool
the
clock
was
striking
four
when
i
retired
and
little
meech
was
still
serving
liquid
gladness
as
uncomplainingly
and
expressionlessly
as
ever
when
i
awoke
at
eight
she
had
just
finished
tidying
up
the
and
was
beginning
her
regular
daily
labors
gradually
we
made
the
acquaintance
of
various
celebrities
there
was
chispa
for
instance
the
little
spanish
who
gave
a
benefit
and
last
final
performance
in
the
plaza
de
toros
each
sunday
the
royal
sport
of
spain
is
at
best
a
gloomy
pastime
in
even
when
skilled
toreadors
from
across
the
atlantic
are
to
be
had
the
bulls
raised
in
the
andean
highlands
are
so
that
the
game
degenerates
into
little
more
than
public
butchery
the
killing
of
horses
is
forbidden
in
the
of
quito
both
by
law
and
because
of
the
high
price
of
those
rare
animals
and
the
toreador
is
not
permitted
to
stir
up
a
sluggish
bull
by
exploding
de
on
his
flanks
chispa
however
who
was
just
such
a
spark
as
his
suggested
would
have
enlivened
the
most
dreary
entertainment
though
his
companions
were
local
amateurs
so
clumsy
that
he
was
called
upon
to
save
the
life
of
each
a
dozen
times
during
each
corrida
each
succeeding
despedida
had
some
new
feature
to
draw
quito
within
the
circular
mud
walls
one
sunday
the
program
announced
the
engagement
of
hombres
de
yerba
and
hombres
gordos
men
of
hay
and
fat
men
and
the
inventive
spaniard
was
all
but
forced
to
lock
the
gates
against
the
tailend
of
the
throng
one
of
his
amateurs
was
bound
round
and
round
with
green
alfalfa
and
set
in
the
center
of
the
ring
the
bull
however
either
was
not
hungry
or
in
no
mood
for
jests
and
tossed
the
helpless
fellow
scornfully
from
his
path
the
hombres
gordos
were
made
up
with
clown
faces
topped
by
silk
hats
their
bodies
padded
to
enormous
size
with
excelsior
still
the
protection
was
not
sufficient
one
was
thrown
so
savagely
that
the
audience
agreed
he
had
been
the
evening
paper
announced
he
had
merely
broken
a
leg
and
several
ribs
the
fat
man
is
no
more
beloved
in
quito
than
elsewhere
and
the
merriment
went
on
unabated
it
is
quiteño
custom
for
the
matador
to
dedicate
the
death
of
each
bull
to
some
celebrity
or
person
of
means
in
the
audience
tossing
the
favored
one
his
cap
to
hold
during
the
killing
and
expecting
it
to
be
thrown
back
with
a
roll
of
bills
in
proportion
to
the
skill
of
the
de
toward
the
end
of
the
last
final
performances
the
supply
of
local
personages
grew
so
low
that
the
eye
of
chispa
roving
around
the
circle
fell
upon
hays
but
even
as
he
opened
his
mouth
for
the
speech
of
dedication
the
faded
from
public
view
then
there
was
umberto
peyrounel
our
first
really
and
truly
flesh
and
blood
derived
from
the
spanish
word
to
walk
the
term
is
used
in
the
andes
to
designate
a
foreigner
who
travels
on
foot
without
any
particular
excuse
for
traveling
at
all
a
peculiarly
latin
type
of
tramp
loving
to
attract
attention
and
making
his
living
by
so
doing
we
ourselves
had
often
been
styled
andarines
on
the
journey
from
bogotá
though
this
genuine
article
scornfully
rated
us
the
distinction
seems
to
be
not
whether
a
man
andars
on
foot
but
whether
he
makes
his
way
without
using
his
own
money
if
such
he
possesses
illustration
probably
not
his
own
in
spite
of
the
circumstantial
evidence
against
him
illustration
the
undertaker
s
delivery
wagon
the
coffin
is
with
gilt
trimmings
we
saw
umberto
first
at
a
sunday
night
concert
where
he
was
inconspicuously
amusing
himself
by
running
races
with
several
hundred
newsboys
and
bootblacks
around
the
plaza
mayor
a
stocky
fellow
tall
as
hays
of
middle
age
he
was
modestly
dressed
in
a
suit
of
corduroy
leather
leggings
and
a
velvet
cap
of
the
dutch
fisherman
or
quartier
latin
style
across
his
chest
hung
a
row
of
large
medals
a
flaring
mustache
all
but
touched
his
ears
and
his
luxurious
black
hair
hung
loose
almost
to
his
waist
when
he
called
on
us
next
morning
his
coiffure
was
done
up
in
a
simple
maidenly
knot
at
the
back
of
his
head
on
closer
examination
the
gleaming
brass
medals
seemed
to
be
glorified
tobacco
tags
he
announced
himself
the
son
of
italian
parents
born
in
the
argentine
of
a
sect
corresponding
to
the
huguenots
of
france
known
as
the
martyrs
of
leaving
home
three
years
before
he
had
walked
across
his
native
land
to
chile
thence
to
quito
where
he
was
preparing
to
push
on
to
bogotá
to
the
people
along
the
even
to
us
until
he
caught
the
gleam
in
our
announced
that
two
great
dailies
of
buenos
aires
and
new
york
had
offered
him
a
prize
of
to
make
the
journey
on
foot
from
the
door
of
one
to
that
of
the
other
on
the
road
he
was
accompanied
by
a
dog
wore
spurs
as
a
sign
of
his
rank
as
a
and
carried
in
addition
to
a
revolver
and
rifle
some
forty
pounds
of
baggage
most
of
which
consisted
of
bulky
ledgers
filled
with
statements
of
his
arrival
and
departure
on
foot
signed
by
every
corregidor
alcalde
or
native
official
of
whatever
species
by
merchants
lawyers
and
editors
of
every
place
large
or
small
he
had
visited
each
adorned
with
its
official
seal
this
collecting
of
signatures
was
no
mere
whim
it
was
the
customary
excuse
of
his
fellows
for
surreptitiously
appealing
to
charity
at
every
hamlet
he
opened
the
to
give
the
residents
the
pleasure
of
adding
their
names
to
the
roll
of
at
the
psychological
moment
slipped
into
their
hands
a
printed
card
bearing
a
subtle
plea
for
assistance
in
winning
his
great
all
genuine
andarines
umberto
assured
us
did
the
same
and
he
berated
us
soundly
for
not
having
adopted
the
custom
how
can
you
prove
to
the
public
that
you
have
made
the
journey
on
foot
if
you
do
not
have
the
testimonials
of
distinguished
persons
along
the
way
he
cried
scornfully
the
public
has
its

peyrounel
was
a
beggar
though
he
would
have
been
shocked
beyond
words
to
hear
us
say
so
he
called
himself
a
champion
of
god
a
bitter
enemy
of
the
priesthood
and
in
each
town
of
importance
gave
a
lecture
on
his
journey
and
later
on
if
the
population
showed
enough
intelligence
a
sermon
the
religious
fanatic

often
proves
sooner

later
to
be
in
a
sexually
neurotic
state
that
we
were
not
surprised
when
several
days
later
peyrounel
burst
out

could
not

put
one

on
the
loose
screw
but
it
could
frequently
be
heard
rattling
the
following
sunday
we
attended
his
first
on
the
dismal
daytime
stage
of
quito
s
hitherto
lifeless
teatro
sucre
sat
peyrounel
utterly
alone
but
for
the
faithful
dog
at
his
feet
thrown
into
silhouette
by
an
uncurtained
window
at
the
back
his
uniform
looking
more
absurd
than
ever
his
hair
hanging
in
long
wet
careful
curls
about
his
broad
shoulders
quito
has
so
few
entertainments
that
it
will
endure
almost
anything
particularly
if
no
admission
is
charged
and
some
three
hundred
men
were
scattered
about
in
the
painfully
upright
seats
when
the
andarín
rose
he
read
first
some
incomprehensible
rodomontade
on
the
power
of
the
will
then
drew
forth
a
manuscript
purporting
to
give
an
account
of
his
journey
in
reality
strictly
confined
to
a
list
of
the
towns
he
had
visited
with
the
height
of
each
above
the
lecture
was
doubly
unsuccessful
for
when
the
speaker
ended
with
an
appeal
for
funds
to
continue
his
statistical
journey
the
gathering
stampeded
so
effectively
that
all
but
a
few
had
escaped
when
he
reached
the
door
and
the
reward
of
his
labors
was
a
bare
six
dollars
next
sunday
he
announced
when
we
met
him
in
the
plaza
that
evening
i
am
going
to
give
the
public
of
quito
the
benefit
of
my
conclusions
on
suicide
suicide
i
shall
prove
is
always
a
prompting
of
the
devil
therefore
it
can
not
be
the
prompting
of
god
ergo
a
man
should
not
commit
suicide
because
he
should
never
yield
to
the
promptings
of
the
truly
a
solomon
of
pure
reason
had
come
to
quito
yet
somehow
the
authorities
always
backward
in
such
matters
failed
to
take
advantage
of
this
splendid
opportunity
to
give
the
teatro
sucre
another
free
airing
never
since
those
days
in
quito
have
i
heard
the
word
andarín
than
the
picture
of
peyrounel
and
his
curls
has
not
come
to
mind
however
he
had
undoubtedly
covered
long
distances
on
foot
and
we
exchanged
many
a
practical
hint
of
roadway
information
he
planned
to
visit
all
the
important
cities
of
the
united
states
and
to
reach
new
york
within
three
years
his
letters
of
introduction
already
included
many
to
american
officials
he
carried
for
instance
one
to
the
mayor
of
seattle
being
an
experienced
traveler
all
may
have
gone
well
with
him
south
of
the
rio
grande
but
beyond
it
lay
dangers
he
did
not
suspect
for
some
unromantic
justice
of
the
peace
unable
to
distinguish
between
an
andarín
and
a
common
vag
between
the
honorable
profession
of
gathering
seals
and
signatures
and
mere
begging
may
have
the
cruelty
to
reward
him
with
the
notorious
year
and
a
on
october
tenth
there
was
an
eclipse
of
the
sun
total
at
the
boundary
and
visible
in
all
the
southern
hemisphere
in
the
days
of
the
scyri
and
incas
such
a
phenomenon
was
taken
as
a
threat
that
the
end
of
the
world
was
at
hand
a
sign
that
an
angry
god
was
abandoning
his
erring
people
on
this
occasion
many
of
the
classes
remained
in
the
streets
all
night
for
an
earthquake
had
been
prophesied
the
local
observatory
had
assigned
a
scientist
to
note
the
peculiar
actions
of
the
populace
and
the
lower
animals
during
the
it
came
toward
seven
in
the
morning
gradually
the
brilliant
sun
disappeared
until
only
the
slightest
thread
of
crescent
shape
remained
visible
the
world
grew
dark
as
at
early
dusk
on
a
heavily
clouded
evening
then
slowly
lighted
up
again
in
all
its
equatorial
magnificence
observers
reported
that
a
few
fowls
returned
to
roost
the
curs
slinking
about
the
plaza
seemed
for
a
time
undecided
whether
to
seek
their
nightly
lairs
but
the
actions
of
the
populace
were
confined
to
the
incessant
smoking
of
cigarettes
and
to
making
the
most
of
an
excuse
to
put
off
their
day
s
task
as
long
as
of
which
was
unusual
enough
to
be
worthy
of
note
the
majority
unsupplied
with
smoked
glasses
found
this
no
handicap
for
the
reflected
eclipse
in
the
plaza
pool
served
the
same
purpose
world
scientists
had
been
sent
to
many
of
the
larger
south
american
cities
with
elaborate
photographic
equipment
only
to
find
their
long
journeys
wasted
because
of
clouds
they
would
have
done
better
to
have
come
to
quito
where
two
unscientific
vagabonds
caught
excellent
pictures
of
the
phenomenon
in
mere
kodak
snapshots

was
on
the
morning
of
november

from
the

we
had
sailed
together
from

i
set
out
along
the
muddy
cobbled
highway

the

station

in

the
size
of
a
suitcase
by
the
former
corporal

taken
his
wooden
seat
in
the
dingy
little

stowed
his

are

let
pass
unnoticed
its
scheduled

of
departure
several
stocky
americans
of
the
type
easily
recognized
as
railroad
men
and
as
many
negroes
could
be
seen
shouldering
their
way
in

the
motley

among
the
native
passengers
after
a
time
they
decided
to
repair
the
last
coach
and
lay
for
some
time
under
it
tinkering
at
a
rumor
had
it
that
this
was
only
a
ruse
that
the
engineer
assigned
to
the
run
had
been
arrested
the
evening
before
and
that
the
train
could
not
leave
until
his
trial
was
over

the
cause
for
delay
it
ended
at
last
and
with
a
great
snorting
and
straining
and
blowing
of
steam

little
old
baldwin
began
to
drag

of

the

the
point

with
no

he

no

stranger
accustomed

moderate
decencies
of

can
pass
only
in

yet
clients
in
and
outwardly
immaculate
garb
are
never
known
to
raise
a
voice
in
protest
there
is
exactly
one
way
to
escape
these
conditions
in
ecuador
and
that
is
to
keep
out
of
the
country
a
modern
crœsus
would
be
forced
to
endure
the
same
for
though
he
brought
his
own
servants
and
even
his
with
him
the
ecuadorian
would
find
some
means
of
reducing
him
to
an
equality
of
condition
if
only
by
opening
the
supplies
in
customs
and
running
his
unwashed
hands
through
them
among
our
table
companions
were
lawyers
university
professors
newspaper
editors
commonly
with
several
rings
on
their
fingers

rare
was
the
man
whose
were
not
in
deepest
mourning
or
whose
manners
were
not
befitting
a
trough
on
the
street
the
passing
of
the
women
was
usually
marked
by
an
all
but
overwhelming
scent
of
the
cheap
and
pungent
perfumes
to
which
all
the
decente
class
male
or
female
is
addicted

though
their
faces
were
daubed

rosy
alabaster
it
was
rare
to
see

clean
hands

without
a
distinct
showing

the
neck
the
city
is
gashed
by
several
deep
gullies
with
trickling
streams
at
their
bottoms
which
serve
as
general
not
even
the
mounts
to
these
heights
and
the
city
is
denied
the
doubtful
services
of
this
tropical
scavenger
though
the
world
hears
little
of
it
the
from
typhoid
alone
in
the
capital
rivals
that
of
yellow
jacket
in
guayaquil
and
no
precautions
whatever
are
taken
against
it
when
he
has
noted
these
customs
and
worse
the
visitor
will
be
startled
into
shrieks
of
sardonic
laughter
when
he
runs
across
a
large
building
bearing
an
elaborately
painted
shield
announcing
it
the
oficina
de
yet
the
quiteño
is
extremely
jealous
of
any
offer
of
other
races
to
do
for
him
that
which
he
gives
no
evidence
of
being
able
to
do
for
himself
once
out
of
colombia
we
had
hoped
for
relief
from
the
perpetual
growling
at
americans
chiefly
in
fiery
and
newspaper
editorials
barely
had
we
crossed
the
frontier
however
than
we
found
ecuador
raging
with
a
new
grievance
the
government
had
recently
invited
the
doctor
in
charge
of
the
sanitation
of
panama
to
inspect
guayaquil
and
bring
his
recommendations
to
the
capital
a
strict
censorship
on
cable
messages
keeps
the
outside
world
largely
in
ignorance
of
the
real
conditions
in
the
pearl
of
the
inside
the
country
however
the
real
state
of
affairs
is
more
nearly
common
knowledge
one
could
pick
almost
at
random
from
the
local
newspapers
such
items
as
guayaquil
yesterday
forty
cases
of
bubonic
plague
broke
out
in
public
school
no
there
are
seven
survivors
the
resident
too
soon
learns
the
real
motives
that
hamper
the
sanitation
of
that
once
it
is
cleaned
up
argue
its
merchants
foreign
competitors
will
flock
in
upon
them
as
to
themselves
they
are
with
rare
exceptions
immune
to
the
two
plagues
for
which
the
port
is
famous
having
recovered
from
them
at
some
earlier
period
of
life
those
who
have
not
recovered
have
no
voice
in
the
matter
there
are
even
foreign
residents
who
bend
their
energies
to
upholding
this
barrier
to
competition
these
interests
now
abetted
by
unseen
european
elements
fostering
the
discontent
and
the
eagerness
of
the
opposing
party
to
make
political
capital
out
of
any
cloth
whole
or
otherwise
had
stirred
the
noisy
little
native
papers
into
a
furor
genuine
or
financed
against
the
government
the
people
in
their
turn
had
worked
themselves
into
the
conviction
that
the
invitation
was
only
an
opening
wedge
of
the
colossus
of
the
north
to
gain
a
hand
in
the
rule
of
the
country
which
it
is
always
the
part
of
the
opposition
papers
to
paint
as
imminent
we
had
not
been
long
in
quito
when
the
attitude
of
the
populace
grew
so
serious
that
a
joint
meeting
of
both
houses
of
congress
was
called
to
explain
the
government
view
of
the
transaction
the
diplomatic
corps
was
present
in
force
and
as
much
of
the
public
as
could
find
after
the
two
houses
had
been
seated
in
the
largest
chamber
available
in
the
government
palace
the
diminutive
old
minister
of
foreign
affairs
who
had
lived
abroad
long
enough
to
acquire
a
point
of
view
explained
the
exact
truth
of
the
situation
as
clearly
as
a
disinterested
foreigner
might
have
done
but
neither
congress
nor
the
populace
would
hear
his
reasoning
the
latter
hooted
him
vociferously
calling
him
yanqui
and
accusing
him
of
being

the
excitement

so
unusual
an
event
as
going
on
a

the
morning
mists
had
only
begun
to
clothe
the
flanks
of
pichincha
when
i
broke
the
clinch
of
don
panchito
s
last
and
creaked
away
down
the
cobbles
of
calle
flores
and
across
the
plaza
santo
domingo
in
the
suited
to
the
long
stony
trail
and
the
rainy
season
ahead
the
remnant
of
my
letter
of
credit
i
had
turned
into
gold
sovereigns
and
sewed
them
in
the
band
of
my
trousers
on
my
back
were
my
at
least
my
south
including
the
awkward
bulk
of
the
packed
with
films
and
chemicals
that
day
had
passed
when
i
dreamed
of
driving
an
indian
carrier
before
me
and
experience
had
taught
me
not
to
risk
the
assistance
of
the
mails
thus
the
world
roamer
must
leave
behind
in
turn
each
after
growing
somewhat
attached
to
it
for
all
its
faults
to
go
its
way
alone
again
as
in
the
past
merely
once
in
a
while
the
cable
brings
him
a
whisper
of
it
as
from
some
former
existence
it
was
a
familiar
route
for
the
first
few
miles
now
and
again
i
overtook
indians
carrying
enormous
loads
of
earthen
jars
and
pots
of
all
sizes
enclosed
in
a
kind
of
often
topped
by
a
great
roll
of
mats
made
of
which
serve
the
carriers
as
beds
men
and
women
alike
raised
their
hats
to
me
and
mumbled
some
obsequious
greeting
they
were
bound
for
latacunga
market
several
days
distant
from
their
villages
yet
even
on
so
long
a
journey
rare
was
the
woman
from
whose

not
peer

hours
later
near
the

of
the

the
ridge
that
marked
my
hitherto
furthest
south

peaks

standing
sharply
forth

lay
close
beside
me

rolling
green

ridges
subsiding
into
the
mountain
lap
where
quito
like
a
tiny
ant

city
still
lay
visible
the
panecillo
that
bulks
so
large
from
the
central
plaza
sunk
to
an
insignificant

across
it
hovered
the

resolutely
astride

streaked
near

with

time

as

as
i
topped
a

kept
getting
little
broken
glimpses
of
the
town
from
the
world
until
at
last
toward
noon
as
a
mighty
mountain
wave
tossed
me
high
on
its
crest
the
view
of
the
city
of
the
equator
flashed
forth
a
moment
more
then
quito
and
all
its
surroundings
sank
away
into
the
irretrievable
past
before
me
lay
a
new
world
with
the
leisurely
dignity
of
its
builder
garcía

the

descended
into
a
great
one

those

down

there
passed
a

of

of

their

were

into
the

cañar
near
the
village
of
macachi
miles
from
the
capital
i
turned
aside
to
the
hacienda
of
a
quiteño
acquaintance
he
was
a
boy
of
eighteen
scion
of
one
of
the
old
best
families
of
ecuador
who
have
kept
their
spanish
blood
free
from
mixture
to
whom
had
recently
fallen
the
ownership
and
management
of
an
enormous
tract
of
his
little
country
educated
in
our
own
land
he
spoke
a
slow
pedantic
english
among
his
equals
he
was
almost
to
the
point
of
diffidence
but
his
voice
was
commanding
enough
when
he
gave
orders
to
his
or
or
to
any
of
the
hundred
indians
who
lived
clustered
about
the
central
hacienda
house
all
of
whom
addressed
him
as
su
merced
your
grace
and
kowtowed
as
often
as
he
looked
at
them
as
their
ancestors
might
have
done
to
the
imperial
scyri
before
the
sun
set
we
had
time
to
ride
across
a
part
of
the
estate
it
lay
somewhat
too
high
for
wheat
distinctly
so
for
corn
except
for
the
cattle
that
flecked
the
upland
fields
far
and
wide
the
potato
was
most
at
home
fourteen
distinct
varieties
of
this
native
tuber
of
the
andes
several
of
them
unknown
in
the
north
grew
on
the
hacienda
in
one
field
women
were
digging
potatoes
large
as
small
muskmelons
though
nearby
were
other
patches
still
red
or
purple
with
blossoms
the
average
wage
of
the
indian
peons
was
five
cents
a
day
with
for
their
miserable
in
which
the
only
furniture
consisted
of
a
few
odds
and
ends
of
pottery
and
some
sheepskins
which
spread
on
the
earth
floor
by
night
served
the
family
its
and
mangy
curs
as
bed
the
women
and
children
worked
for
nothing
wages
being
reckoned
by
family
rather
than
individually
except
that
the
women
who
milked
the
cows
were
each
paid
a
dollar
a
month
in
reality
the
indians
were
serfs
of
the
estate
when
first
hired
they
are
hooked
by
a
labor
agent
and
having
spent
their
advance
in
a
prolonged
chicha
debauch
must
often
be
arrested
and
forced
to
carry
out
their
part
of
the
contract
usually
remaining
for
years
if
not
a
lifetime
in
debt
to
the
hacendado
it
would
be
an
error
however
to
look
upon
their
condition
from
our
northern
point
of
view
any
custom
taken
out
of
its
native
environment
has
a
far
more
serious
aspect
than
the
reality
warrants
the
indian
trained
during
many
generations
of
inca
rule
to
avoid
all
personal
initiative
or
responsibility
accepts
by
choice
this
patriarchal
arrangement
the
majority
had
been
attached
to
the
hacienda
since
birth
giving
the
community
the
aspect
of
one
immense
family
each
household
had
its
little
plot
of
ground
for
its
own
garden
and
the
privilege
of
pasturing
a
small
flock
or
herd
yet
the
owners
have
the
best
of
the
bargain
nearer
the
capital
were
estates
where
indians
made
adobe
bricks
at
ten
cents
a
day
with
and
food
making
daily
some
three
hundred
each
which
the
owner
sold
at
cents
a
hundred
the
of
sincholagua
and
the
rugged
ridge
of
rumiñaui
faced
the
hacienda
though
little
higher
the
place
was
infinitely
colder
than
quito
in
its
mountain
pocket
for
here
we
caught
the
full
sweep
of
the
winds
off
the
by
dark
we
were
both
huddled
in
the
hacienda
bleak
and
comfortless
in
spite
of
its
extravagant
trinkets
from
the
outer
world
the
peons
for
all
their
awe
of
their
youthful
lord
could
not
deny
themselves
the
pleasure
of
grouping
noiselessly
before
the
door
as
we
ate
listening
to
the
strange
quichua
stranger
still
not
even
their
erudite
master
spoke
with
this
traveler
from
unknown
parts
who
came
on
foot
carrying
his
own
load
like
any
indian
the
crack
of
the
door
grew
ever
wider
the
broad
expressionless
faces
ever
more
numerous
until
a
draft
of
the
bitter
mountain
night
air
caused
his
grace
to
glance
up
in
annoyance
both
crack
and
faces
disappeared
silently
and
suddenly
but
came
again
many
times
before
we
each
crawled
early
under
four
heavy
blankets
next
morning
the
highway
no
longer
cobbled
but
wide
and
smooth
without
wheeled
traffic
soon
brought
illinaza
into
full
sight
before
me
so
skillfully
did
it
bear
me
upward
that
by
noon
i
was
crossing
the
great
of
the
nudo
de
tiopullo
without
the
consciousness
of
having
climbed
at
all
the
andean
for
which
we
have
no
exact
english
word
is
not
the
sharp
mountain
peak
my
imagination
had
pictured
but
is
used
of
any
broad
plain
so
lofty
that
not
even
the
hardy
indian
will
live
upon
it
where
most
of
domestic
plants
refuses
to
grow
a
drear
treeless
upland
covered
only
with
a
tough
brown
that
gives
it
somewhat
the
aspect
of
our
virgin
prairies
to
a
northerner
in
motion
it
was
not
uncomfortable
by
sunshiny
day
but
no
one
passes
these
lofty
plains
at
night
by
choice
only
a
rare
shepherd
s
shelter
of
stones
and
dots
the
immensity
the
shivering
highway
hurried
due
south
across
it
bringing
to
view
another
and
barely
pausing
for
a
last
glance
back
at
the
faint
peak
of
cotacache
and
the
long
bulk
of
pichincha
grown
mere
parts
of
a
broad
hazy
tilted
horizon
raced
downward
into
the
softer
valley
some
miles
south
of
quito
begins
a
veritable
desert
from
a
distance
the
ranges
to
right
and
left
seem
green
yet
the
ascending
valley
grows
so
dry
and
arid
that
even
the
scanty
scrub
trees
die
of
thirst
at
the
top
of
a
barren
divide
i
met
panting
harder
than
i
and
moving
no
faster
the
little
train
from
the
coast
crowded
with
weary
passengers
almost
sheer
above
me
stood
forth
the
beautiful
cone
of
cotopaxi
equalled
in
symmetry
on
all
the
earth
s
surface
only
by
fujiyama
to
the
left
the
hoary
head
of
tungaragua
far
away
in
the
blue
haze
of
the
hot
tropical
oriente
it
looks
down
upon
rose
gradually
higher
into
the
sky
then
the
highway
descended
and
went
ever
more
swiftly
downward
into
a
hole
in
the
ground
and
by
three
i
was
tramping
the
cobbled
streets
of
ambato
the
winter
resort
of
wealthy
quiteños
a
mere
feet
above
to
one
accustomed
to
loftier
quito
it
had
a
tranquil
air
its
people
were
more
friendly
lacking
that
suggestion
of
belligerency
common
to
quiteños
there
was
indeed
something
pleasing
about
it
that
i
had
never
yet
seen
in
ecuador
it
reminded
one
mildly
of
egypt
in
air
and
odor
and
the
dust
sweeping
across
from
the
barren
arid
hills
that
wall
it
in
the
market
of
this
town
hung
midway
between
the
tropics
and
the
temperate
zone
offers
the
fruits
of
and
mangoes
side
by
side
with
apples
pears
peaches
and
native
capulí
at
five
cents
a
raspberries
and
blackberries
and
the
perennial
strawberries
that
are
singsong
daily
through
the
streets
of
quito
it
was
from
the
of
ambato
that
i
caught
my
first
glimpse
of
chimborazo
the
giant
of
the
andes
just
the
crown
of
its
long
glacier
ridge
brilliant
white
against
the
steely
highland
sky
as
it
stood
on
tiptoe
peering
over
the
barren
ridges
of
carhuairazo
barely
had
i
entered
the
hotel
when
its
dishevelled
crowded
around
me
to
ask
if
i
were
an
peyrounel
it
proved
had
once
favored
the
establishment
with
his
distinguished
if
financially
disadvantageous
presence
i
pleaded
too
colorless
garments
to
merit
the
title
to
these
andean
village
youths
the
arrival
of
so
romantic
a
being
was
what
that
of
the
yearly
circus
is
to
our
towns
of
the
far
interior
yet
when
i
offered
any
of
them
double
his
present
wage
to
accompany
me
and
carry
a
few
pounds
of
my
pack
they
shook
their
heads
and
shrunk
fearfully
away
it
is
not
as
i
gradually
learned
to
my
growing
astonishment
merely
because
they
know
no
better
that
the
people
of
the
andes
sleep
on
wooden
beds
in
quito
i
had
found
many
who
refused
to
use
the
imported
springs
and
i
know
at
least
two
doctors
who
prescribed
wooden
beds
for
kidney
trouble
here
in
ambato
a
perfectly
respectable
had
been
completely
floored
over
and
the
unsuspecting
gringo
instead
of
landing
on
a
soft
and
yielding
mattress
found
himself
on
such
a
couch
as
a
thinly
carpeted
floor
might
be
nor
was
this
by
any
means
the
last
bed
out
of
which
i
pulled
the
lumber
and
spread
the
above
the
springs
ambato
claims
the
title
of
athens
of
ecuador
and
indeed
four
of
the
country
s
principal
writers
lived
and
died
here
which
is
more
than
can
be
said
of
the
capital
the
place
of
honor
in
the
main
plaza
gorgeous
with
geraniums
of
every
shade
of
red
is
occupied
by
the
statue
of
juan
montalvo
commonly
rated
the
country
s
chief
literary
light
in
ambato
juan
león
mera
wrote
his
cumandá
the
accepted
classic
among
ecuador
s
novels
and
one
may
still
visit
the
family
of
luis
martínez
whose
a
la
costa
is
worthy
a
place
in
south
american
literature
if
only
for
its
magnificent
descriptions
of
tropical
scenery
i
left
ambato
on
a
morning
so
cold
that
gloves
would
have
been
welcome
one
of
those
mornings
frequent
in
ecuador
when
the
sun
rises
like
a
beauty
of
the
harem
pushing
aside
the
soft
white
curtains
of
her
alcove
when
the
mountains
at
the
bases
of
which
dense
masses
of
clouds
and
mist
have
gathered
seem
gigantic
altars
on
pedestals
of
marble
soon
the
sun
grew
ardent
and
imperious
capriciously
burning
away
the
of
the
night
blazing
down
unrestrained
on
the
rolling
plains
of
huachi
so
arid
and
monotonous
the
road
lay
deep
in
sand
across
a
with
no
other
adornment
than
the
fences
of
of
the
cactus
family
that
replace
the
dividing
ditches
or
mud
further
north
to
mark
the
limits
of
the
poor
heritages
of
the
indians
the
chief
industry
here
is
the
weaving
of
a
coarse
cloth
from
the
fibers
of
the
here
and
there
a
capulí
tree
persisted
and
impenetrable
bushy
clumps
of
the
thorny
bristled
aggressively
the
few
planted
fields
were
sparse
and
drear
though
near
the
town
where
the
thirsty
had
been
transformed
by
irrigation
into
patches
of
green
on
which
the
eyes
rested
gratefully
grew
the
strawberry
large
and
fragrant
higher
and
higher
rose
the
world
though
so
imperceptibly
that
the
ascent
was
noted
only
because
the
landscape
opened
out
to
ever
greater
vistas
it
was
a
day
of
climax
in
volcanoes
around
the
circle
of
the
spreading
horizon
the
white
crests
of
no
fewer
than
eight
of
the
great
of
the
earth
grew
up
about
me
until
i
paused
on
a
high
ridge
to
study
them
to
the
right
for
a
time
looking
like
a
single
mass
of
rock
and
snow
stretched
long
carhuairazo
with
chimborazo
rising
behind
it
then
gradually
the
great
dome
of
this
everest
of
america
detached
itself
and
stood
forth
in
all
its
immensity
far
behind
yet
perfectly
clear
in
spite
of
the
blue
haze
of
some
forty
miles
distance
cotapaxi
once
so
savage
in
its
destruction
reared
itself
into
the
like
an
occidental
twin
sister
of
fujiyama
to
the
left
in
military
precision
three
stood
shoulder
to
antisana
and
one
above
which
rose
a
column
of
smoke
that
marked
it
as
sangai
most
active
of
the
western
world
but
a
few
days
before
in
destructive
eruption
then
came
the
rounded
cone
of
tungarahua
keeping
its
eternal
watch
over
the
tropical
oriente
and
to
the
south
noblest
of
all
peering
forth
first
in
the
early
mists
and
growing
in
grandeur
all
the
morning
stood
dreaded
el
altar
its
beauty
now
completely
unveiled
a
fantastic
mass
of
peaks
and
pinnacles
like
some
phantom
city
of
ice

playing

music
on

made
of
a
section
of
bamboo
for
hours
the
horizon
continued
across
the
sands
of
huachi
travelers
had
been
few
toward
noon
they
grew
plentiful
around
every
turn
appeared
indians
and
their
competitors
with
such
monotonous
persistency
that
i
needed
a
cudgel
to
drive
out
of
my
way
the
asses
which
expressionless
and
impassive
as
their
masters
were
inclined
to
march
serenely
on
irrespective
of
human
obstacles
the
rare
or
tawny
countrymen
who
live
in
their
along
the
way
were
interesting
only
as
evidence
of
how
man
may
become
at
mocha
where
i
halted
in
the
early
afternoon
the
of
chimborazo
lay
piled
into
the
sky
overhead
a
mountain
still
though
the
town
stands
more
than
two
miles
above
the
sea
all
the
following
morning
its
arctic
dome
towered
close
on
my
right
as
i
plodded
along
its
gentle
slope
not
far
below
the
snow
line
often
in
the
ruts
which
generations
of
and
indians
had
worn
in
the
brown
uninhabited
páramo
dreary
with
long
slightly
rolling
stretches
of
across
which
i
only
now
and
then
overtook
a
the
drivers
wrapped
to
their
ears
in
their
heavy
ponchos
behind
across
a
hazy
valley
now
more
than
forty
miles
away
the
symmetrical
cone
of
cotapaxi
gleamed
faintly
forth
in
a
new
dress
of
snow
that
had
fallen
during
the
night
a
cobbled
highway
ran
along
the
bottom
of
a
slight
hollow
some
distance
off
but
travelers
had
scorned
it
so
long
in
favor
of
the
rutted
páramo
that
grass
was
grown
high
between
its
cobbles
and
at
length
as
if
it
resented
the
abandonment
it
swung
off
in
the
direction
of
cajabamba
and
was
gone
the
dozen
ruts
across
the
páramo
finally
joined
forces
to
form
a
kind
of
road
that
turning
its
back
on
chimborazo
around
whose
white
head
a
storm
was
brewing
struck
off
toward
a
long
undulating
hazy
valley
backed
by
blue
heaps
of
ranges
gradually
i
descended
to
almost
a
desert
again
by
a
road
deep
in
sand
rising
and
falling
over
countless
the
peaked
huts
of
indians
tossed
like
abandoned
old
straw
hats
far
up
the
flanks
of
the
drear
mountainsides
on
either
hand
at
one
of
these
i
found
the
first
use
for
my
new
revolver
an
enormous
dog
plainly
bent
on
destruction
bounded
out
upon
me
without
a
sound
halted
abruptly
with
a
faint
yelp
as
i
pressed
the
trigger
turned
a
complete
somersault
and
fell
feet
upward
like
a
captive
turtle
not
two
yards
from
me
ordinarily
there
is
little
to
be
feared
from
the
sneaking
curs
of
all
colors
that
swarm
about
every
hut
throughout
the
length
of
the
andes
before
the
conquest
tradition
has
it
the
indians
had
only
the
mute
now
least
it
is
certain
that
none
of
those
that
remain
are
mute
these
degenerate
descendants
of
the
animals
brought
over
by
the
spaniards
rival
the
original
chaos
of
sound
as
they
rush
out
in
cowardly
packs
upon
any
a
for
as
the
white
man
s
dog
abhors
an
indian
so
do
these
a
white
their
masters
gaze
stolidly
on
without
so
much
as
attempting
to
call
them
off
the
indian
of
the
andes
does
not
raise
dogs
he
has
them
merely
because
he
is
too
passive
to
get
rid
of
them
the
curs
are
never
treated
as
pets
the
only
caress
they
ever
receive
is
a
kick
or
a
prod
from
which
they
retreat
sluggishly
with
a
cowardly
yelp
even
if
the
weapon
misses
its
aim
they
are
never
fed
but
exist
on
such
offal
as
the
indian
himself
disdains
a
mountaineer
to
whom
i
put
the
question
once
briefly
expressed
the
viewpoint
of
his
race
how
can
we
help
having
many
dogs
patrón
they
breed
so
often
from
the
village
of
san
andrés
picturesquely
backed
by
the
of
el
altar
architecturally
as
diffuse
as
the
castle
of
schwerin
a
spreading
highway
bordered
by
endless
cactus
hedges
led
toward
a
great
sandy
plain
far
ahead
a
small
forest
of
eucalypti
that
marked
the
site
of
riobamba
giving
it
center
further
on
for
all
the
aridity
was
plenty
of
corn
with
numberless
peaked
thatched
huts
peering
above
the
vegetation
on
either
hand
at
the
entrance
to
riobamba
i
saw
the
first
llamas
of
my
south
american
journey
once
an
indian
passed
driving
a
llama
and
an
ass
hitched
together
further
on
several
of
these
absurd
peruvian
sheep
pasturing
beyond
the
cactus
hedge
craned
their
long
necks
to
gaze
curiously
after
me
times
without
number
i
had
been
assured
that
not
only
was
the
llama
never
a
draft
or
a
milch
animal
but
that
it
could
never
be
ridden
that
it
would
carry
exactly
a
hundred
pounds
and
would
irrevocably
lie
down
if
another
ounce
were
added
and
that
it
could
under
no
circumstances
be
urged
beyond
a
slow
dignified
walk
imagine
my
surprise
then
when
suddenly
i
beheld
a
llama
bestridden
by
a
indian
come
down
the
road
at
a
brisk
trot
and
watched
them
fade
away
in
the
distance
beyond
in
the
town
beyond
there
was
one
llama
for
every
two
donkeys
riobamba
chief
city
between
quito
and
the
coast
is
commonly
described
as
lying
at
the
foot
of
the
description
must
not
be
taken
too
literally
i
had
imagined
a
cold
haughty
little
town
snuggled
together
in
a
lap
of
the
high
andes
but
if
riobamba
lies
at
the
foot
of
chimborazo
so
in
only
somewhat
lesser
degree
does
guayaquil
the
traveler
turns
his
back
on
the
giant
of
the
andes
and
tramps
a
long
before
he
comes
to
what
in
situation
and
general
appearance
might
be
a
town
on
the
sandy
prairies
of
western
nebraska
its
monotonously
streets
are
unusually
wide
painfully
cobbled
and
swirling
with
sand
its
architecture
is
drearily
like
that
of
any
other
andean
city
it
has
been
several
times
destroyed
by
earthquake
were
it
not
like
quito
more
than
two
miles
aloft
it
would
be
even
more
often
destroyed
by
its
personal
habits
at
sunrise
thrice
a
week
most
of
the
town
turns
out
to
watch
the
trains
that
have
overnighted
here
leave
for
quito
and
guayaquil
respectively
whence
its
suggestion
of
some
frontier
village
of
railroad
hotels
in
our
western
states
unlike
quito
riobamba
has
a
it
is
a
platform
on
wheels
with
a
flat
roof
supported
by
under
which
are
some
crosswise
boards
that
are
called
seats
with
the
same
tolerance
with
which
a
place
to
lie
on
the
floor
is
called
a
bed
and
a
place
the
traveler
may
possibly
be
able
to
make
his
way
through
is
called
a
road
like
some
andean
newspapers
it
appears
every
now
and
then
when
a
pair
of
blasé
mules
drag
it
across
town
to
the
station
and
back
usually
only
on
train
days
many
ride
and
the
more
poorly
dressed
seem
to
pay
for
the
privilege
but
the
indians
take
good
care
not
to
be
caught
on
any
such
risky
contraption
there
is
commonly
not
a
sight
to
be
seen
in
riobamba
unless
it
be
the
stern
white
face
of
chimborazo
looking
down
upon
the
city
from
the
middle
distance
to
the
north
the
traveler
who
chances
upon
the
town
of
a
saturday
or
sunday
however
will
find
it
a
place
of
interest
then
the
indian
population
of
a
thickly
inhabited
region
comes
from
thirty
or
more
miles
around
to
what
is
rated
ecuador
s
greatest
market
the
sandy
plaza
larger
than
an
american
city
block
is
so
densely
packed
with
stolid
men
and
women
in
gray
felt
hats
and
blankets
that
only
by
constant
struggle
can
a
purchaser
thread
his
way
across
it
from
my
room
on
the
corner
above
not
a
foot
of
open
ground
was
visible
the
scene
was
like
a
swarming
of
myriad
ants
of
many
colors
like
a
great
oriental
rug
undulating
in
the
sunshine
as
one
crowds
along
between
the
rows
of
hawkers
all
the
products
of
the
region
seem
to
pass
in
procession

were

many

a

with
only
a
chicken

a
gaunt

a

sat
all

selling

perhaps
ten

bushel

together
with

was
a
pile

ugly

an

glance
toward
the
icy

chimborazo
about
them
hovered
something
akin
to
the
glamour
that
surrounds
the
arctic

all
day
long
was
an
endless
motley
going
and
coming
through
the
adjacent
streets
and
plazas
amid
which
the
imagination
could
easily
drop
back
four
centuries

fancy
what

climbs

until
the
hill

seen
sinks
to
a
dot
on
the
landscape
it
was
so
brilliant
a
sunday
that
chimborazo
seemed
to
hang
almost
sheer
above
the
town
and
the
whole
bulk
of
tungarahua
loomed
clearly
forth
from
its
tropical
home
when
i
set
out
after
midday
for
what
i
had
been
told
was
an
easy
s
tramp
within
an
sudden
are
the
changes
in
weather
zones
icy
rain
was
pouring
down
upon
my
shoulders
bowed
with
the
weight
of
a
pack
at
last
i
sprawled
to
a
summit
with
an
view
of
the
entire
district
of
riobamba
the
city
itself
a
mere
fleck
far
below
in
an
landscape
roofed
by
clouds
through
which
the
unseen
sun
cast
a
single
faint
shaft
as
from
a
weak
spotlight
the
rain
which
in
ecuador
falls
in
zones
sharply
cut
off
one
from
another
ceased
abruptly
at
the
top
of
the
barrier
here
were
two
roads
from
which
to
choose
and
for
hours
thereafter
i
could
not
know
whether
the
one
that
descended
a
sharp
valley
beside
a
tiny
stream
led
anywhere
near
where
i
wished
to
go
well
down
the
vale
were
scattered
hamlets
of
grass
and
mud
huts
of
a
tribe
of
indians
the
men
in
white
goatskin
trousers
that
gave
them
the
appearance
of
greek
satyrs
the
dwellings
often
hung
far
up
the
steep
walls
that
enclosed
the
growing
stream
many
of
the
inhabitants
ran
away
at
my
approach
the
rest
stared
at
me
from
safe
heights
as
i
sped
on
down
the
valley
ugly
white
curs
abounded
in
the
scanty
trees
a
bird
sang
now
and
then
but
for
the
most
part
only
the
sound
of
the
stream
leaping
from
rock
to
rock
broke
the
silence
cold
darkness
fell
and
still
the
broken
trail
descended
swiftly
at
rare
intervals
a
corner
of
the
moon
peered
through
the
clouds
then
in
the
blackest
of
nights
the
road
forked
again
giving
me
another
random
choice
a
wild
windy
uninhabited
hour
beyond
the
path
fell
suddenly
away
under
my
feet
and
i
found
myself
involved
in
a
labyrinth
of
holes
and
chasms
large
as
houses
as
if
the
region
had
been
wrecked
by
a
long
series
of
earthquakes
a
score
of
times
i
climbed
down
hand
over
hand
into
immense
ruts
with
walls
high
above
my
head
certain
i
had
lost
my
way
yet
with
no
other
choice
than
to
press
on
two
hours
at
least
this
riot
of
the
earth
s
surface
continued
before
there
appeared
suddenly
the
lights
of
a
considerable
town
dimly
seen
through
the
night
across
a
wet
blurred
valley
backed
by
an
all
but
invisible
mountainside
a
trail
picked
itself
together
again
under
my
feet
pitched
headlong
down
to
a
roaring
little
river
straddled
by
an
aged
stone
bridge
ghostly
white
in
the
pallid
moonlight
and
led
me
stumbling
into
the
railroad
village
of
guamote
still
booming
with
the
tomtoms
of
the
sunday
fiesta
that
had
left
its
scattered
débris
of
drunken
indians
through
all
the
length
of
the
town
from
guamote
i
followed
the
silent
but
railway
through
a
landscape
like
that
of
southern
texas
winding
in
and
out
between
dreary
hills
peopled
only
by
a
rare
shepherd
in
goatskin
trousers
then
across
broad
stretches
of
slightly
rolling
desert
scantily
covered
with
the
sand
sweeping
over
it
in
clouds
from
palmira
dismal
little
station
buildings
at
some
feet
railroad
drops
steadily
for
all
the
more
than
a
hundred
miles
to
the
coast
some
way
down
the
descending
valley
the
land
turned
almost
suddenly
from
dreary
brown
to
the
green
of
another
that
gradually
climbed
the
mountain
walls
that
shut
me
in
beyond
alausí
next
morning
i
made
a
swift
descent
even
swifter
by
sliding
down
the
face
of
the
notorious
devil
s
nose
where
the
track
mounts
in
three
sections
one
above
the
other
and
reached
the
little
town
of
huigra
in
time
for
here
in
a
green
valley
between
high
hills
falling
abruptly
into
a
prattling
stream
are
the
main
offices
and
hospitals
of
the
railroad
and
an
american
atmosphere
tempered
with
whiffs
of
england
and
ecuador
to
which
the
fever
and
bubonic
of
guayaquil
do
not
mount
nor
the
ills
of
quito
descend
at
huigra
my
route
was
to
turn
southward
over
the
enclosing
mountain
wall
but
i
had
no
objection
to
coasting
down
into
the
tropics
on
a
to
guayaquil
itself
and
when
the
chief
engineer
promised
a
screened
refuge
from
sun
to
sun
i
accepted
the
invitation
gladly
all
that
is
necessary
to
travel
from
huigra
to
is
to
get
something
on
wheels
of
the
right
gage
and
let
her
slide
rather
let
her
slide
within
very
definite
limits
lest
one
reach
the
bottom
far
sooner
and
in
poorer
condition
than
was
planned
with
a
native
employee

of
us

on
the
sheer
front

of
the

the
experienced
hand
of
the

on
the
brake

roared
in
and
out
and
ever
down
the
mountain

the
towering
walls
on
either
side
rising
higher
above
us
with
every
yard
forward
a
foaming
river
keeping
us

not
much
slower
company

at

at

suddenly
reached
the
forests
in
striking
contrast
to
the
bare
upland
plateau
of
ecuador
grew
up
about
us
as
if
by
magic
foaming
mountain
brooks
dashed
down
from
either
towering
wall
to
join
the
to
save
the
company
the
expense
of
building
swiftly
the
trees
changed
in
species
hardy
highland
shrubs
to
voluptuous
tropical
growths
till
the
airy
bamboo
noblest
of
ferns
bowed
to
us
in
graceful
dignity
from
the
crowded
forest
as
we
screamed
past
before
noon
we
swung
out
of
the
gorge
i
had
followed
from
palmira
and
halted
at
bucay
it
had
been
like
dropping
in
two
hours
from
may
to
a
dense
and
heavy
july
from
a
northern
scene
to
one
like
that
of
panama
with
the
same
sticky
atmosphere
negroes
and
outdoor
life
here
we
took
possession
of
the
empty
on
the
rear
of
the
day
s
and
sat
with
our
feet
on
the
back
railing
watching
the
tropical
world
run
away
and
shrink
up
to
nothingness
behind
us
the
track
lay
straight
as
a
s
course
through
the
tunnel
of
forest
and
jungle
indians
and
their
gay
garments
had
disappeared
here
were
only
the
colors
of
nature
along
the
way
thatched
houses
of
split
bamboo
slouched
in
languid
attitudes
and
slightly
dressed
families
peering
from
their
sort
of
verandas
behind
partly
raised
blinds
hinged
at
the
top
for
all
the
lazy
languor
of
the
scene
jungle
products
succeeded
each
other
swiftly
cacao
then
gladdened
the
eyes
the
air
grew
heavier
now
and
then
a
great
field
of
broke
briefly
the

with

along

it
back

favorite

exactly
my

sped
past

numerous
at
stations
the
fruit
lay
in
piles
at
the
feet
of
indifferent
vendors
the
brown
on
its
small
green
trees
appeared
splendid
cocoanut
palms
heavy
with
nuts
heralded
the
sea
maidenly
slender
broad
fields
of
rice
growing
arm
in

with

corn
the
plebeian
tree
with
its
broad
leaves
fancily
cut
as
with
scissors
in
the
hands
of
an
inventive
child
and
always
gigantic
tropical
trees
cut
fantastically
into
the
of
the
day
above
behind
always
fixed
as
fate
itself
the
dim
and
clouded
range
of
the

a
giant
wall
blue
and
unbroken
shut
off
the
world
beyond
here
and
there
a
hoary
peak
showed
above
the
clouds
so
high
one
could
not
believe
it
possible
far
off
in
the
heavens
like
a
great
cloud
chimborazo
stood
white
and
immovable
as
in
the
forest
one
sees
only
trees
so
only
down
here
looking
at
the
chain
as
a
whole
could
one
realize
the
loftiness
of
those
realms
where
one
had
been
living
for
months
more
than
two
miles
above
the
sea
naked
brown
babies
huts
on
ever
longer
legs
hammocks
grew
numerous
and
languid
loungers
to
fill
them
here
and
there
appeared
a
chinaman
some
large
towns
and
all
on
stilts
like
a
army
buzzards
circling
lazily
overhead
amid
scents
that
whispered
of
plague
and
sudden
death
then
on
either
hand
began
to
appear
the
low
hills
of

properly
deep

bravely
above

black
waters

would
soon
swallow
them
up

vast
mountain

across
the
world
behind
had
grown
a
shade
bluer
when
we
drew
into
durán
on
the
banks
of
the
guayas
and
brushing
both
clear
with
housewifely
care
of
any
lurking

through

the
scent
of

sudden
death
is
reputed
to
fly
chiefly
by
night
along
the
guayas
so
only
when
the
sun
was
high
did
we
venture
across
to
ecuador

metropolis
and
guayaquil
outwardly
the
low
city
looked
far
cleaner
than
quito
but
here
filth
grants
no
immunity
during
three
hours
we
saw
the
black
funeral
pass
nine
by
no
means
all
the
population
can
afford
so
splendid
an
exit
from
the
world

here
were
electric
tramways
for
the
first
time

bogotá
larger
shops
and
more
ambitious
displays
than
in
quito

signs
of
greater

activity
the
houses
were
of
wood

low

all
the
windows
with

at

it
was

foreign

a
curious
indifference
to
local

seeming
greater
at
a
distance
than
on
the

americans
yawned
at
the
mention
of
yellow

and
went
about
their
business
with
as
little
apparent
worry
as
a
new

of

by

nothing

next

the
lifted
us
back
to

where
a
new
experience
awaited
me
that
evening
i
sat
writing
in
the
railroad
quarters
two
were
parading
the
broad
veranda
of
the
light
wooden
building
the
only
other
sound
was
the
muffled
chatter
of
the
stream
below
suddenly
the
heavy
table
beneath
my
arm
began
to
move
as
at
some
spiritualist
séance
the
windows
took
to
rattling
as
if
in
some
sudden
terror
to
escape
from
their
frames
the
wall
decorations
swung
back
and
forth
like
pendulums
and
for
what
seemed
a
long
minute
the
entire
building
shook
as
with
a
paludic
fever
i
opened
my
mouth
to
protest
against
what
i
took
for
a
moment
to
be
physical
exuberance
of
the
veranda
paraders
but
i
closed
it
again
as
i
realized
that
i
had
passed
through
my
first
earthquake
and
had
gone
on
writing
for
a
line
or
more
before
i
recognized
the
good
fortune
of
being
in
a
wooden
house
outside
the
strollers
had
not
even
interrupted
their
chat
except
to
remark
pretty
good
one
eh
and
when
the
natives
in
the
town
below
had
left
off
shouting
evidently
in
an
attempt
to
scare
off
the
dreaded
spirit

to
its

the
silence
broken
only
by

prattling
on
through

the

brought
word
that
the

had
fallen

in

a
hundred
and
four
weeks
a
year
where
my
mules
would
sink
to
their
ears
in
mud
and
be
left
to
perish
where
i
myself
would
infallibly
die
of
exposure
if
my
caravan
were
overtaken
by
night
out
on
the
lofty
páramo
i
easily
forestalled
the
peril
to
my
mules
and
the
second
i
resolved
to
avoid
by
not
letting
night
overtake
me
it
was
not
certainly
an
ideal
road
there
were
places
where
the
writhing
trail
was
for
miles
a
series
of
earth
ridges
with
deep
ditches
of
mud
and
water
between
like
an
endless
corduroy
road
and
these
made
hard
going
indeed
for
laden
animals
for
as
often
as
one
of
them
set
foot
on
one
of
these
as
they
are
called
in
the
andes
it
slipped
off
into
the
muddy
ditch
between
as
likely
backward
as
forward
giving
a
very
exaggerated
imitation
of
the
gait
of
a
camel
in
fact
it
is
this
constant
slipping
and
sliding
of
passing
that
turns
certain
wet
regions
of
the
andes
into
camelones
in
places
the
slope
climbed
steep
mountainsides
through
narrow
trails
worn
twenty
feet
deep
down
or
up
which
horses
or
cargo
mules
stumbled
and
sprawled
constantly
threatening
to
smash
their
packs
against
the
side
walls
or
underfoot
but
it
was
a
route
far
worse
for
horsemen
than
for
a
man
afoot
i
stepped
blithely
from
ridge
to
ridge
not
only
but
at
my
regular
pace
easily
leaving
all
competitors
behind
and
while
there
were
germs
of
truth
in
the
warning
that
a
mule
and
his
cargo
slipping
and
falling
upon
me
in
one
of
the
gullies
might
bring
my
journey
to
a
halt
the
very
simple
remedy
for
that
possibility
was
not
to
be
found
loitering
beneath
an
animal
when
he
fell
donkey
carcasses
and
the
skeletons
of
mules
and
horses
were
frequent
along
the
way
and
always
now
broken
now
for
a
time
incessant
came
out
of
the
blind
mist
the
raucous
bawling
of
arrieros
anda
mula
caramba
the
dense
heavy
fog
turned
to
pouring
rain
indeed
there
were
evidences
to
verify
the
assertion
that
this
was
one
of
the
zones
of
ecuador
where
the
rainy
season
reigns
perennially
in
i
passed
a
few
indian
hovels
i
had
been
warned
to
stop
for
the
night
in
the
last
of
these
rare
habitations
if
i
would
not
end
my
wayward
career
out
on
the
arctic
páramo
of
the
nudo
de
azuay
but
the
native
assured
me
there
were
others
a
on
and
i
had
climbed
twice
that
distance
across
a
dismal
stretch
of
without
a
sign
of
life
except
a
scanty
herd
of
wild
shaggy
cattle
before
i
realized
that
the
indian
had
told
the
old
lie
to
be
rid
of
an
importunate
guest
within
me
there
grew
the
conviction
that
in
spite
of
my
best
intentions
i
should
some
day
shoot
a
large
round
hole
through
some
indian
for
sending
me
further
up
into
the
uninhabited
night
however
there
i
was
exactly
where
of
all
places
in
ecuador
i
had
so
often
been
warned
in
several
tongues
not
to
let
night
overtake
me
the
gray
walls
about
me
dimmed
like
a
lamp
turned
out
these
páramo
trails
being
even
by
day
only
a
straggling
of
interwoven
paths
often
effaced
it
was
not
in
the
order
of
things
that
i
should
keep
the
route
long
in
unmitigated
night
for
a
time
i
stumbled
along
an
irregular
ground
full
of
holes
picking
every
step
ahead
with
my
stick
like
a
blind
man
and
even
at
that
now
and
then
sprawling
on
all
fours
as
to
direction
i
could
only
trust
to
luck
then
i
felt
under
foot
and
all
efforts
to
find
the
trail
again
were
wasted
vaguely
i
felt
that
i
had
come
out
on
the
nose
of
a
mountain
through
the
night
there
came
faintly
to
my
ears
the
sound
of
a
waterfall
and
from
somewhere
far
off
the
dismal
howling
of
a
dog
rode
by
on
the
raging
wind
the
ground
under
my
feet
took
on
the
angle
of
a
steep
roof
it
required
stick
hands
and
extreme
vigilance
to
keep
from
pitching
headlong
down
into
the
bottomless
unknown
i
felt
my
way
inch
by
inch
several
hundred
feet
downward
without
finding
a
level
space
as
large
as
my
hand
in
the
end
i
could
only
sit
down
on
my
bundle
in
the
mud
brace
my
feet
against
a
tuft
of
and
piling
my
most
perishable
possessions
in
my
lap
button
my
poncho
over
my
head
sup
on
a
butt
of
bread
and
settle
down
to
keep
my
precarious
seat
until
daylight
he
who
fancies
an
ecuadorian
mountainside
a
pleasant
night
s
merely
because
it
is
near
the
equator
has
still
something
of
geography
to
learn
strangely
enough
it
might
have
been
worse
the
poncho
was
almost
impervious
to
cold
entirely
so
to
rain
as
the
scottish
chieftain
of
earlier
days
soaked
his
tartan
before
lying
down
for
a
night
in
the
highland
heather
so
the
wetness
of
all
about
me
seemed
to
add
warmth
the
rain
redoubled
yet
i
should
scarcely
have
known
it
but
for
its
pelting
above
my
head
i
dozed
now
and
then
into
a
nap
after
one
of
them
i
peered
out
into
the
wintry
night
to
find
the
mist
alive
with
hardy
fireflies
so
large
that
those
which
started
up
near
me
seemed
to
my
dull
fancy
the
lanterns
of
some
prowling
band
twice
some
animal
perhaps
a
wild
romped
by
me
when
i
looked
out
again
a
bright
moon
was
shining
yet
i
felt
too
comfortable
as
i
was
to
take
advantage
of
it
to
push
on
and
fell
asleep
again
not
without
a
drowsy
misgiving
that
some
diligent
hunter
might
try
a
shot
at
my
huddled
shaggy
form
standing
out
in
the
moonlight
against
the
swift
mountainside
until
i
remembered
that
no
native
ever
ventures
out
upon
an
andean
páramo
except
in
the
full
light
of
day
dawn
showed
the
lost
trail
zigzagging
in
three
branches
down
the
face
of
the
mountain
the
waterfall
lay
directly
below
me
yet
so
steep
was
the
slope
on
which
i
was
perched
that
i
had
to
crawl
back
again
up
the
trail
on
all
fours
and
descend
with
it
far
away
across
a
valley
so
deep
i
could
not
see
its
bottom
lay
in
plain
sight
what
i
knew
to
be
the
town
of
cañar
a
mere
white
speck
halfway
up
the
great
mountainside
beyond
it
is
chiefly
noted
for
its
outlook
upon
the
world
from
a
distance
it
seemed
to
hang
upright
on
the
vertical
mountain
flank
once
arrived
i
found
it
occupied
the
flat
top
of
one
of
the
countless
hills
that
pile
higher
and
higher
into
the
sky
to
culminate
in
a
great
andean
chain
here
was
a
land
of
stone
everywhere
in
field
and
valley
rocks
lay
more
profusely
and
far
larger
in
size
than
on
any
abandoned
new
england
farm
if
the
old
town
of
cañar
had
any
features
at
all
different
from
hundreds
of
others
down
the
crest
of
the
andes
it
was
its
large
proportion
of
stone
buildings
over
those
of
mud
it
is
perhaps
the
existence
of
stone
rarer
to
the
north
that
accounts
for
the
presence
near
cañar
of
the
first
ruins
of
unquestionably
inca
origin
their
victorious
march
to
the
north
too
was
so
quickly
followed
by
the
arrival
of
the
spaniards
that
the
children
of
the
sun
left
no
permanent
works
about
quito
and
beyond
the
imperial
highway

cuzco
to
what
is
ecuador
built
by
a
race
less
fearful
of
the
lofty
places
and
mighty
cañons
of
the
andes
was
more
direct
than
the
modern
haphazard
route
where
it
descended
from
the
páramo
of
azuay
and
climbed
out
of
the
gorge
beyond
there
was
built
a
fortress
and
a
for
the
housing
of
the
imperial
cortège
that
is
known
as
ingapirca
which
some
believe
to
be
that
same
tomebamba
where
huayna
ccápac
the
great
was
born
and
where
the
news
of
the
landing
on
the
coast
of
a
strange
tribe

short
his
journey

his
old
age

he
who
would
visit
ingapirca
must
have
either
a
guide
or
a
working
mixture
of
spanish
and
quichua
i
lost
myself
a
dozen
times
in
a
labyrinth
of
paths
each
leading
to
an
isolated
indian
hovel
one
might
have
fancied
the
aboriginals
had
surrounded
the
sacred
inca
relics
with
a
conspiracy
of
silence
for
i
was
forced
at
last
to
drag
an
old
man
forcibly
out
of
a
cluster
of
huts
before
he
pointed
out
to
me
a
path
that
wound
away
upward
and
disappeared
over
the
edge
of
the
world
along
it
i
came
at
last
in
sight
of
ingapirca
the
castle
of
the
gentiles
as
it
is
locally
known
sits
silent
and
on
the
summit
of
a
from
which
the
eye
ranges
in
every
direction
over
a
tumbled
labyrinth
of
valleys
and
ridges
they
built
high
the
incas
as
men
who
preferred
to
see
with
their
own
eyes
what
was
going
on
about
them
and
they
seem
to
have
gloated
over
the
unbroken
sweep
of
the
cold
invigorating
andean
wind
the
chief
ruin
is
that
of
a
fortress
an
oval
wall
with
a
sheer
rock
face
to
the
north
and
symmetrical
stone
steps
leading
up
to
the
entrance
on
the
south
of
large
cut
stones
and
with
ornamental
blind
doors
or
niches
it
is
so
like
the
monuments
of
peru
as
to
leave
no
doubt
of
its
inca
origin
even
on
the
curves
the
stones
are
so
nicely
fitted
apparently
without
humboldt
reported
the
discovery
of
a
kind
of
cement
between
there
are
few
joints
for
which
a
modern
contractor
would
berate
his
workmen
the
walls
are
double
with
earth
between
them
the
inner
wall
less
carefully
constructed
and
undisturbed
centuries
have
filled
the
interior
of
the
fort
to
a
level
above
this
rise
the
remnants
of
a
building
only
adobe
walls
with
some
doorways
still
standing
but
the
many
wrought
stones
to
be
found
in
fences
and
in
the
scattered
heaps
in
which
dwell
the
modern
inhabitants
of
the
region
suggest
that
the
adobe
walls
had
once
a
complete
casing
of
cut
stone
slight
as
are
the
remains
there
is
still
sufficient
setting
for
the
fancy
to
picture
huayna
ccápac
striding
back
and
forth
upon
his
lofty
promenade
looking
upon
his
four
corners
of
the
earth
and
halting
in
his
meditations
to
watch
the
imperial
racing
toward
him
across
the
rugged
landscape
with
news
of
the
landing
in
his
imperial
domains
of
a
tribe
with
hair
on
their
faces
hours
of
strenuous
toil
piloted
only
by
my
brought
me
back
to
the
main
route
for
a
space
it
was
a
real
highway
faced
with
stone
but
soon
degenerated
into
a
writhing
chaos
of
ruts
and
rocky
like
a
road
in
the
throes
of
an
epileptic
fit
the
sun
was
still
high
when
i
caught
sight
of
biblián
its
famous
sanctuary
standing
out
white
and
clear
against
the
dull
mountainside
above
the
town
but
it
was
only
in
the
thickening
dusk
that
i
finally
climbed
into
it
a
youth
replied
to
my
first
inquiry
with
a
cómo
no
as
unexcitedly
as
if
strangers
came
to
biblián
every
year
or
two
in
the
dingy
little
shop
to
which
he
led
me
an
old
woman
whose
greedy
face
warned
me
to
prepare
for
exorbitant
charges
even
before
i
learned
she
went
to
church
four
times
a
day
hunted
up
the
enormous
key
to
an
immense
room
above
in
a
corner
of
it
stood
a
bed
at
least
a
century
old
covered
with
a
marvelous
lace
counterpane
but
harder
than
macadam
while
i
sat
at
more
exactly
at
vegetables
since
biblián
kills
its
weekly
beef
on
sunday
and
by
monday
it
is
customary
delegation
of
citizens
came
to
offer
their
respects
the
town
it
proved
was
oppressed
with
a
great
worry
the
earthquake
of
a
week
before
had
not
merely
tumbled
down
several
mud
of
the
region
but
had
given
new
life
to
a
prophesy
that
clanged
deafeningly
at
intervals
without
a
break
could
not
sleep
of
nights
and
the
priests
were
reaping
a
rich
harvest
all
night
long
i
lay
like
a
hindu
ascetic
on
his
couch
of
nails
listening
to
the
exquisite
torture
of
a
that
clanged
deafeningly
at
intervals
without
a
break
except
for
a
frequent
wild
hellish
jangling
of
several
minutes
duration
when
dawn
broke
the
entire
population
had
already
crowded
into
the
church
for
early
mass
a
bun
was
not
to
be
had
with
my
morning
coffee
because
my
hostess
had
locked
up
the
shop
to
attend
the
second
ceremony
i
ordered
breakfast
for
eleven
and
a
boy
came
to
inform
me
that
i
must
eat
it
at
nine
since
from
that
hour
on
señora
la
patrona
would
again
be
at
church
biblián
is
a
city
of
pilgrimage
by
morning
light
it
proved
to
be
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
fields
of
corn
with
countless
and
masses
of
geraniums
lending
it
even
more
color
than
the
variegated
blankets
of
its
inhabitants
the
valley
was
scattered
with
scores
of
tiled
cottages
of
the
peasants
the
hillsides
a
network
of
paths
and
trails
to
their
huts
and
tiny
farms
the
chief
road
climbed
to
the
on
a
crag
well
above
the
town
it
was
a
costly
structure
richly
decorated
within
though
a
dismal
mud
hut
served
biblián
as
school
the
virgin
of
biblián
is
noteworthy
among
a
host
of
her
sisters
in
not
having
come
personally
to
pick
out
a
spot
and
order
the
building
of
her
shelter
perhaps
her
history
is
still
too
recent
for
the
successful
concoction
of
such
traditions
in
the
valley
of
biblián
was
choking
with
drought
the
local
cura
alive
to
his
opportunity
set
up
an
image
in
a
grotto
on
the
mountainside
and
consulting
his
barometer
implored
rain
the
drought
was
broken
in
honor
of
the
feat
the
image
was
named
the
virgin
of
the
dew
and
pilgrims
began
to
flock
to
biblián
in
the
volume
which
he
has
prepared
for
their
instruction
the
foresighted
cura
bewails
the
fact
that
we
can
not
tell
in
one
book
the
countless
cures
assistances
protections
and
the
blessed
virgen
del
rocío
has
done
for
the
faithful
from
all
over
in
the
face
of
the
appalling
mass
of
proofs
before
him
he
confines
himself
to
none
but
he
does
mention
the
miraculous
fact
that
the
first
chapel
had
been
completed
by
august
of
the
following
year
and
that
two
years
later
the
present
sumptuous
rich
divine
sanctuary
was
sprinkled
with
holy
water
barely
was
this
dry
when
the
troops
of
the
liberal
party
like
the
barbarians
at
the
gates
of
rome
threatened
the
afflicted
capital
of
the
azuay
bringing
inevitable
ruin
for
example
as
the
curbing
of
the
power
of
the
when
the
powerful
blessed
virgen
del
rocío
was
borne
from
biblián
to
beleaguered
cuenca
with
fitting
reverence
and
in
the
midst
of
the
most
crowded
and
pompous
procession
in
the
annals
of
that
catholic
city
whereupon
the
liberal
troops
faded
quickly
away
and
redoubled
the
fame
of
the
virgin
and
the
income
of
biblián
parish
the
minister
plenipotentiary
of
the
vatican
has
seen
fit
to
grant
a
hundred
days
indulgence
to
whoever
visits
the
sanctuary
which
indulgence
may
be
applied
to
souls
in
the
trip
to
biblián
is
worth
at
least
that
lovers
of
justice
will
rejoice
to
know
that
the
foresighted
cura
bids
fair
to
enjoy
for
long
years
to
come
his
of
barometers
it
is
only
a
league
from
biblián
to
azogues
an
hour
s
stroll
along
a
slight
river
through
almost
a
forest
of

with

about

were

of

and

among

spreading
far
away
up

down

shopkeepers
and
their
clerks
made
hats
in

and
even
while
waiting
on
them
indian
and

women
wove
them
as
they
tramped
along
the
roads
with
a
bundle
and
perhaps
a

on
their
backs
as
european
peasant
women

those
of

spin

on

i
was
assured
that
every
living
person
in
azogues
knew
how
to
the
fops
themselves
were
so
engaged
somewhere
out
of
sight
the
weekly
of
azogues
began
on
the
friday
evening
of
my
arrival
as
the
afternoon
declined
there
streamed
in
from
every
point
of
the
compass
from
every
hut
among
the
surrounding
men
women
and
children
each
carrying
a
newly
woven
hat
bushy
with
its
uncut
straw
ends
a
dozen
agents
from
cuenca
bought
these
as
they
arrived
never
at
the
price
demanded
but
after
a
heated
bargaining
to
which
in
the
end
the
weavers
always
meekly
yielded
each
buyer
seemed
to
confine
himself
to
some
particular
grade
or
style
this
one
to
coarse
comunes
that
to
large
sizes
another
to
small
and
only
two
or
three
to
the
finer
weaves
as
he
bought
them
each
agent
piled
the
hats
on
his
own
head
until
his
face
was
completely
hidden
behind
the
protruding
ends
from
the
depths
of
which
the
bargaining
went
on
unabated

strode

along

highway
to

next
morning
throngs
were
pouring
into
the
city
from
every
direction
for
a
full
two
hours
i
passed
an
endless
stream
of
indians
as
close
together
as
an
army
in
column
of
squads
the
women
carrying
on
their
backs
every
product
known
to
southern

the
men
for
the
most
part
were
burdened
only
by
a

one
atop
the
other
the
untrimmed
ends
hiding
their
faces
as
under
shaggy
beards
the
scene
recalled
the
great
trunk
road
of
india
yet
was
of
vastly
less
interest
and
variety
he
who
had
once
seen
an
ecuadorian
indian
had
seen
all
the
procession
a
few
were
weaving
the
last
strands
of
their

his

in

his
weekly
debauch
before
he
sallies
forth
to
squander
his
week
s
earnings
however
he
carefully
lays
away
enough
to
purchase
another
tuft
of
straw
lest
he
have
no
from
which
to
hatch
next
saturday
s
celebration
the
procession
had
thinned
considerably
before
it
occurred
to
me
to
count
the
passersby
and
even
then
persons
passed
me
in
a
minute
each
and
all
bearing
something
for
the
market
of
azogues
during
most
of
the
two
hours
the
number
had
easily
doubled
that
and
this
was
only
one
of
the
many
roads
and
trails
leading
to
this
town

from

such
a
spot
is
cuenca
dimming
by
comparison
its
latest
rival

and
i
find
in
my
notes
of
the
exuberant
first
day
there
the
assertion
of
all
the
earth
as
far
as
i
know
it
cuenca
has
the
most
perfect
always
cool
enough
to
be
mildly
invigorating
to
mind
and
body
yet
never
cold
it
is
unexcelled
as
a
place
for
dreamy
loafing
the
sunshine
vastly
exceeds
the
shadow
and
its
situation
is
in
the
scenery
of
its
surrounding
mountains
which
are
distant
and
low
but
in
the
rich
fertility
of
this
great
vale
of
paucarbamba
flowery
plain
as
the
incas
called
it
cuenca
has
no
fitting
excuse
for
not
being
one
of
the
richest
agricultural
cities
on
earth
yet
its
only
hotels
are
dirty
little
indian
without
sleeping
accommodations
and
the
traveler
must
fall
back
on
the
prehistoric
system
of
hunting
up
a
friend
s
friend
for
once
this
roundabout
method
brought
handsome
results
at
the
home
of
the
montesinos
brothers
i
found
my
most
accommodations
south
of
quito
in
a
highly
cultured
family
with
no
scent
of
the
public
hostelry
about
it
my
front
door
opened
on
a
vista
across
the
patio
and
the
long
market
plaza
usually
shimmering
with
indians
and
clashing
colors
to
the
blue
hills
and
a
strip
of
sky
to
the
west
and
it
is
only
fair
to
the
andes
to
mention
that
this
extraordinary
family
had
erected
in
a
back
patio
a
lavatory
stoutly
padlocked
against
the
indians
of
the
household
the
montesinos
brothers
sons
of
a
former

of

of

as

as

in
the
intellectual
life
of
the
city
excellent
examples
of
the
best
grade
of
one
was
a
teacher
of
french
and
english
which
did
not
seriously
mean
that
he
could
speak
either
of
those
tongues
in
this
bookish
somewhat
effeminate
man
had
started
a
revolution
against
the
alfaro
government
in
the
person
of
general
franco
a
bloodthirsty
from
esmeraldas
who
had
been
made
governor
of
azuay
it
proved
unsuccessful
and
the
instigator
had
been
forced
to
fly
to
the
jungled
oriente
and
live
for
months
among
the
jívaros
indians
i
had
hesitated
to
believe
my
own
convictions
on
certain
conditions
in
ecuador
but
this
frank
and
outspoken
native
outdid
anything
i
might
have
said
his
attitude
was
in
striking
contrast
to
that
belligerent
pride
of
governments
and
their
led
mobs
and
politicians
to
him
the
patriotism
of
his
fellows
was
rubbish
what
he
wanted
was
an
efficient
government
and
a
chance
to
live
a
free
life
whether
he
remained
a
subject
of
the
particular
strip
of
territory
known
as
ecuador
or
of
the
gigantic
so
many
seemed
to
fancy
imminent
he
asserted
that
the
police
of
cuenca
were
its
worst
criminals
all
thieves
and
ruffians
who
could
not
be
openly
convicted
were
sentenced
to
serve
as
policemen
except
in
the
collecting
of
taxes
and
as
a
place
of
reward
for
its
henchmen
the
central
government
leaves
cuenca
and
the
south
of
ecuador
virtually
abandoned
and
that
tendency
so
general
in
countries
for
the
more
distant
parts
to
break
away
and
form
a
free
or
at
least
autonomous
state
is
here
marked
the
region
labors
under
a
thousand
petty
annoyances
for
instance
quito
has
a
service
with
the
outside
world
but
cuenca
has
none
nor
any
system
and
about
one
piece
of
mail
in
three
ever
reaches
an
addressee
in
the
capital
of
the
azuay
a
package
mailed
from
abroad
to
a
cuencano
lies
in
guayaquil
until
the
addressee
appears
in
person
or
appoints
a
lawyer
to
lay
claim
to
it
to
pay
the
fees
and
grease
the
wheels
of
the
legal
and
illegal
formalities
necessary
to
set
it
on
its
way
to
its
destination
to
our
modern
notions
cuenca
is
not
much
of
a
city
yet
here
in
the
almost
untracked
wilderness
it
seemed
enormous
so
rarely
do
strangers
visit
it
that
large
as
it
is
and
in
spite
of
my
entirely
conventional
appearance
i
could
barely
pause
in
the
street
without
all
work
in
the
vicinity
ceasing
and
a
crowd
gathering
about
me
hungry
to
behold
a
new
face
as
the
crew
of
a
windjammer
that
has
gazed
only
upon
themselves
during
long
months
at
sea
their
attitude
seemed
to
say
we
can
work
but
there
is
no
certainty
that
we
can
have
the
pleasure
of
looking
at
a
it
is
hard
for
americans
with
their
wide
outlook
and
accustomed
to
the
complicated
existence
of
our
large
cities
to
realize
the
narrowness
of
life
in
these
placid
old
adobe
towns
hidden
away
in
the
andes
virtually
cut
off
from
the
outside
world
the
cuencanos
are
a
peculiarly
bookish
people
we
do
not
know
said
montesinos
that
there
are
places
on
the
globe
where
men
live
in
freedom
and
decency
except
from
yet
in
spite
of
being
rather
uncertain
of
their
dignity
like
all
isolated
peoples
the
educated
classes
were
as
as
as
any
i
met
in
two
things
only
were
necessary
to
join
the
upper
caste
white
collar
and
the
former
above
a
patched
was
more
effective
than
a
new
suit
worn
with
a
flannel
shirt
and
the
man
who
has
his
name
printed
on
bits
of
cardboard
to
exchange
with
regal
courtesy
and
profound
bows
with
every
acquaintance
is
instantly
accepted
as
of
gente
decente
origin
indeed
visiting
cards
should
be
as
fixed
a
part
of
every
andean
traveler
s
equipment
as
heavy
boots
one
could
not
but
pity
these
ineffectually
ambitious
mortals
kept
down
by
leaden
environment
and
isolation
he
who
does
not
deal
in
panama
hats
has
hardly
an
opening
in
cuenca
except
to
study
medicine
law
or
theology
in
the
local
colegio
hence
there
is
a
plethora
of
doctors
who
can
only
wear
their
titles
and
live
the
life
of
enforced
bookworms
forbidden
by
the
rigid
rules
of
caste
even
the
privilege
of
turning
their
hands
to
some
useful
occupation
as
in
bogotá
the
very
isolation
and
lack
of
opportunity
has
driven
many
to
their
studies
and
cuenca
numbers
many
writers
among
her
sons
producers
chiefly
of
that
languid
pretty
poetry
full
of
the
fine
writing
the
divorce
from
life
and
unlimited
leisure
to
polish
their
gems
of
thought

in
all
cuenca

is
only
one

can
only
as
it
were
feed
upon
each
other
and
form
mutual
admiration
societies
where
admiration
soon
palls
from
too
constant
familiarity
and
lack
of
new
blood
few
even
of
the
best
families
have
ever
been
out
of
the
or
basin
in
which
the
city
lies
and
its
isolation
has
given
the
place
something
of
the
atmosphere
the
traveler
is
always
in
a
world
wholly
removed
from
outside
influence
their
ineffective
eagerness
to
learn
was
pathetic
the
most
nearly
educated
young
men
of
the
town
had
rented
a
hall
near
the
main
plaza
and
decorated
its
façade
with
huge
letters
announcing
it
the
english
language

the
score
or
so
of
more
or
less
residents
of
the
male
sex
gathered
together
several
evenings
a

string
out
in
regular

gradations

the

for
years
however
there
had
not
been
a
genuine
person
living
permanently
anywhere
near
cuenca
in
their
eagerness
to
capture
an
authority
the
club
drafted
me
at
once
and
whole
delegations
were
always
ready
to
go
about
and
show
me
the
town
and
it
was
a
not
too
distant
vicinity
for
they
had
as
great
a
dread
as
the
quiteño
of
getting
far
from
the
central
plaza
i
was
received
kindly
and
eagerly
by
the
educated
men
anywhere
so
long
as
it
did
not
involve
my
intrusion
on
the
moorish
seclusion
of
their
family
life
and
became
a
sort
of
honored
guest
of
the
town
even
if
i
was
not
presented
with
the
key
to
it
which
by
comparison
with
the
would
have
been
a
burden
indeed
they
were
not
spenders
money
comes
slowly
and
with
too
great
a
strain
in
these
parts
but
they
were
ever
on
the
lookout
to
do
me
little
kindnesses
barely
was
i
settled
therefore
when
i
was
hurried
off
to
an
evening
at
the
english
language
club
convoked
in
special
session
for
an
hour
i
sat
like
the
chief
buffoon
in
a
ensemble
in
the
center
of
a
horseshoe
circle
that
included
a
score
of
swarms
with
doctors
and
grandsons
of
presidents
sons
of
ministers
to
washington
and
the
court
of
james
while
the
whole
gathering
like
got
off
a
sentence
or
two
in
more
or
less
english
in
regular
rotation
around
the
circle
until
some
shining
genius
suggested
that
as
they
had
so
illustrious
a
guest
with
them
it
was
merely
a
social
evening
and
not
a
regular
meeting
hence
the
rule
demanding
that
only
english
be
spoken
was
not
in
force
with
a
veritable
explosion
of
relief
the
entire
club
burst
into
spanish
and
alfonzo
was
himself
again
later
experience
proved
that
the
rule
was
largely
a
even
at
regular
meetings
and
only
to
be
enforced
when
the
arrival
of
an
illustrious
stranger
put
the
club
on
parade
the
walls
were
hung
with
several
mottoes
in
english
and
they
had
gathered
together
some
belated
american
magazines
and
a
billiard
table
there
the
members
gathered
several
evenings
a
week
to
play
pocar
and
to
practice
very
intermittently
such
english
as
they
had
learned
from
the
printed
page
forming
their
sentences
was
pronunciation
from
the
rules
books
had
to
offer
and
mixing
in
with
it
a
bit
of
a
similar
brand
of
french
as
if
any
foreign
language
answered
more
or
less
the
purposes
of
the
club
the
rules
forbade
the
use
within
the
of
any
tongue
than
our
own
but
after
the
first
few
set
greetings
of
goot
how
do
yô
do
the
gathering
settled
down
to
an
uproar
of
castilian
broken
only
by
the
few

the

former
ecuadorian
minister
to

who
had
spent
a

or
two
in
shared
with

the
position
of
final
authority
on
the

except
on
those
rare
occasions
when
a
traveler
brought
the
real
article
with
him
even
the
authorities
were
not
faultless
they
said
díssiples
for
pupils
used
habitually
the
expression
i
can
to
go
and
clung
tenaciously
to
similar
choice
bits
of
their
own
convictions
and
what
was
worse
drilled
them
into
their
with
that
dogmatism
strongest
in
those
who
are
wrong
but
the
minister
s
son
had
made
the
most
of
his
american
residence
in
learning
pocar
so
thoroughly
that
he
was
as
real
an
authority
on
that
art
as
he
fancied
himself
in
english
unfortunately
the
combined
efforts
of
the
club
had
not
unearthed
among
all
the
classics
that
had
drifted
together
in
generations
of
cuenca
s
flirting
with
english

fascinating
pastime
whence
they
had
been
forced
to
adopt

on
the
wall
appeared
a
warning
placard
those
which

pocar
are
speaking

and
each

was
sprinkled
with
a
of

punctuated
by
fixed
phrases
of

the
expressions

two
months
before
the

had
not

arrived

he
appeared
nightly
at

his

were
still
somewhere
on

ranged
from

of

fine
a

to

of

renowned
of

amazon
montesinos
had
lived
long
months
among
them
at
the
time
of
his
mishap
and
knew
their
ways
well
a
proud
untamed
race
engaged
in
almost
constant
warfare
with
the
neighboring
tribes
they
consider
the
white
man
an
equal
and
treat
him
as
a
friend
so
long
as
he
does
not
transgress
their
strict
tribal
laws
the
andean
indian
with
his
slinking
air
and
his
heavy
clothing
they
look
down
upon
as
a
weakling
and
a
very
inferior

enemy

reduce
the

to
the
size

with
the
original
features
easily
recognizable
in
this
state
it
is
said
to
be
of
little
use
to
its
rightful
owner
even
if
recovered
the
desiccated
head
must
according
to
tribal
laws
be
kept
until
after
the
yearly
ceremony
to
appease
the
spirit
of
the
dead
man
after
which
it
is
hung
up
as
a
trophy
over
the
entrance
to
the
successful
hunter
s
house
or
what
is
far
more
usual
of
late
years
traded
to
some
passing
white
man
for
a
rifle
or
a
supply
of
cartridges
one
traveler
i
met
had
been
so
eager
to
obtain
one
of
the
dried
heads
that
he
offered
a
jívaro
chief
two
rifles
the
chief
replied
sadly
that
though
he
would
do
anything
possible
to
get
a
rifle
unfortunately
it
happened
that
the
tribe
did
not
have
a
single
dried
head
on
hand
but
he
cried
a
moment
later
his
countenance
brightening
visibly
could
you
wait
a
month
or
so
a
few
years
ago
a
tall
lanky
german
arrived
in
cuenca
and
went
down
among
the
jívaros
to
study
their
customs
and
especially
to
find
out
exactly
how
they
shrink
heads
month
after
month
passed
without
a
word
from
him
but
cuencanos
knew
the
teuton
way
of
pursuing
an
investigation
step
by
step
in
all
its
details
and
ramifications
and
thought
nothing
of
the
prolonged
absence
then
one
day
more
than
a
year
later
there
was
offered
for
sale
in
the
market
of
cuenca
a
splendid
specimen
of
shrunken
head
with
long
blond
hair
and
beard
and
a
scholarly
cast
of
countenance
the
investigation
had
been
thorough
but
the
outside
world
still
remains
in
darkness
on
the
art
of
shrinking
heads
among
the
jívaros
to
the
stranger
perhaps
the
feature
of
cuenca
that
will
remain
longest
in
his
memory
is
her
street
lights
certainly
if
it
happens
to
be
his
lot
to
have
to
find
his
way
home
on
a
black
night
after
a
sad
comedy
in
the
local
of
the
colegio
the
laws
of
cuenca
require
that
every
resident
in
the
principal
streets
set
up
a
candle
before
his
house
but
as
the
which
are
satisfactory
to
the
law
are
short
and
not
particularly
inflammable
and
the
wind
is
given
to
blowing
its
hardest
during
the
first
hour
after
dusk
the
city
changes
long
before
eight
from
long
lanes
between
unseen
to
a
medieval
inky
blackness
the
inhabitant
who
stirs
abroad
carries
a
square
glass
box
containing
a
flickering
candle
or
is
accompanied
by
a
in
true
medieval
fashion
the
stranger
who
being
no
smoker
chances
not
even
to
have
matches
with
him
feels
his
way
homeward
for
an
uncertain
number
of
blocks
by
counting
them
with
his
fingers
at
last
discovering
the
plaza
on
which
he
lives
by
hugging
the
corner
of
it
shivering
with
uncertainty
as
to
whether
his
lodging
is
the
third
or
the
fourth
door
from
the
butchershop
with
the
protruding
hook
here
and
there
stumbling
over
a
piece
of
sidewalk
or
into
a
puddle
he
finally
coaxes
his
gigantic
key
to
fit
its
lock
with
something
far
more
potent
than
satisfaction
thus
life
runs
its
placid
course
in
this
city
of
the
andes
those
who
come
there
after
the
railway
from
huigra
reaches
cuenca
if
plans
some
day
mature
will
no
doubt
find
it
different
more
blasé
and
less
likable
no
longer
one
of
the
rewards
of
toiling
over
the
world
s
byways
even
electric
lights
are
threatened
and
before
them
will
flee
one
of
its
most
nearly
unique
characteristics
the
hope
of
securing
an
ass
to
stagger
out
of
cuenca
under
my
possessions
had
melted
day
by
day
during
my
week
there
in
what
i
had
been
assured
was
the
best
in
ecuador
those
animals
proved
both
scarce
and
high
in
price
toward
the
end
of
my
stay
the
baggage
i
had
sent
from
huigra
had
arrived
both
developing
tank
and
tray
broken
in
spite
of
the
vociferous
promises
of
the
though
still
serviceable
with
elaborate
manipulation
it
was
chiefly
that
forced
me
to
turn
packhorse
had
i
been
able
to
abandon
everything
connected
with
photography
i
might
have
pranced
along
like
a
under
his
knowledge
a
pack
of
nearly
fifty
pounds
remained
in
spite
of
a
rigid
reduction
and
a
desperate
throwing
away
which
included
even
my
medicine
case
bequeathed
to
montesinos
for
ever
since
crossing
the
rio
grande
into
mexico
seventeen
months
before
i
had
been
burdened
with
it
without
a
single
excuse
to
swallow
one
of
its
myriad
pills
if
only
edison
would
take
a
day
off
to
invent
a
baggage
on
legs
that
would
trot
after
its
a
modest
little
baggage
of
say
fifty
would
revolutionize
life
distinguished
visitors
to
the
cities
of
the
andes
are
in
all
accounts
extant
met
upon
their
arrival
and
sent
on
their
way
by
a
cavalcade
of
horsemen
including
all
the
local
celebrities
for
the
first
time
in
my
journey
i
was
accompanied
by
a
guard
of
honor
as
i
plodded
heavily
out
of
cuenca
on
march
tenth
that
is
montesinos
the
master
of
english
strolled
with
me
across
the
ancient
cobbled
bridge
over
the
matadero
and
a
mile
or
more
beyond
until
he
met
the
sun
coming
up
from
the
jungled
montaña
of
the
jívaros
and
turned
back
with
the
indians
to
his
scholastic
duties
the
broad
highway
was
dry
and
hard
as
a
floor
prepared
in
my
heavy
boots
for
the
usual
andean
trail
i
could
have
walked
it
in
the
great
cuenca
shrunk
to
an
fertile
valley
stretching
southward
along
a
little
stream
called
the
tarqui
a
score
of
indians
were
plowing
a
single
field
with
plows
fashioned
from
forest
trees
so
scant
is
his
individual
initiative
that
the
andean
husbandman
works
well
only
in
company
with
his
fellows
and
the
experienced
mayordomo
conducts
his
farming
in
a
succession
of
bees
in
which
all
the
employees
join
efforts
as
in
the
days
of
the
inca
the
andes
grow
higher
and
more
mountainous
to
the
south
beyond
the
hacienda
and
the
hamlet
of
cumbe
next
morning
the
valley
closed
in
and
forced
the
highway
to
scale
like
an
escaping
prisoner
his
walls
the
great
andean
knot
of
portete
bit
by
bit
it
shrunk
to
a
narrow
road
then
to
a
rocky
trail
like
a
man
about
to
begin
some
mighty
task
with
no
longer
time
to
consider
his
personal
appearance
reducing
himself
to
the
bare
essentials
through
clumps
of
blackberries
and
corn
it
climbed
then
shook
off
even
these
and
split
into
faint
diverging
paths
across
another
of
those
lofty
solitary
páramos
of
the
andes
broken
here
and
there
only
scantily
covered
with
the
dreary
of
the
highlands
and
low
bushy
it
would
have
been
more
to
the
point
if
the
sympathy
the
old
woman
of
the
hacienda
behind
had
taken
the
form
of
a
roadster
s
lunch
with
which
to
follow
up
the
coffee
and
diaphanous
roll
of
an
ecuadorian
by
ten
i
was
starving
by
eleven
i
had
eaten
even
the
rose
i
wore
in
a
during
the
next
few
hours
i
found
three
blackberries
hard
and
green
and
shook
dice
with
sudden
death
by
eating
a
handful
of
a
wholly
unknown
and
even
more
tasteless
páramo
berry
the
one
indian
i
met
during
the
afternoon
misinformed
me
before
he
sped
on
out
of
reach
that
nabón
was
a
bare
two
leagues
beyond
and
all
the
rest
of
the
day
my
imagination
persisted
in
heaping
up
mighty
banquets
that
toppled
over
and
faded
away
as
i
prepared
to
fall
upon
them
suddenly
the
páramo
ended
as
if
it
had
been
hacked
off
with
a
dull
gigantic
machete
and
the
haggard
trail
stumbled
blindly
down
into
a
labyrinthian
chaos
of
jagged
white
rocks
like
an
arctic
sea
in
upheaval
an
earthquake
section
as
split
and
smashed
and
broken
as
if
the
world
had
come
into
collision
at
this
point
with
another
planet
or
a
celestial
when
at
last
i
sighted
nabón
long
after
i
had
entered
it
a
score
of
times
in
imagination
it
was
still
a
mere
speck
on
a
broken
edge
of
the
earth
s
crust
which
i
reached
by
dusk
only
by
dint
of
a
herculean
struggle
it
was
a
cornfield
town
of
thatched
mud
huts
of
universally
indian
blood
the
alcalde
was
not
at
home
but
the
priest
s
word
was
law
and
i
was
soon
dropping
my
bundle
from
my
grateful
shoulders
in
the
best
room
of
an
indian
dwelling
my
unwilling
host
removed
the
bedclothes
and
piled
them
on
the
uneven
earth
floor
in
an
adjoining
room
for
himself
wife
and
child
and
left
me
the
bedstead
the
mud
walls
were
embellished
not
merely
with
the
gaudy
colored
chromos
of
various
virgins
but
with
scores
of
the
advertising
pages
of
american
magazines
chiefly
pictorial
for
the
family
could
not
even
read
its
own
tongue
i
did
not
succeed
in
discovering
how
these
exotic
reminders
of
home
had
found
their
way
to
this
unknown
village
of
the
andes
the
indian
and
his
wife
kept
me
awake
half
the
night
with
their
alternating
prayers
and
responses
before
a
lithograph
in
the
adjoining
room
each
prayer
beginning
blessed
santa
maría
give
us
this
blessed
santa
maría
give
us
one
would
have
thought
maría
ran
a
department
store
it
is
only
eighteen
miles
from
nabón
to
oña
but
no
mere
words
can
give
any
suggestion
of
the
labyrinthian
toil
that
lies
between
them
down
in
the
bottom
of
the
mightiest
chasm
of
this
tortured
section
of
the
earth
sits
an
isolated
peak
shaped
like
an
angular
haycock
from
the
lowest
point
of
the
day
s
tramp
i
could
not
see
its
summit
when
i
looked
back
hours
later
upon
the
immense
stretch
of
gashed
and
tumbled
world
behind
me
the
peak
had
sunk
to
a
mere
dot
on
the
landscape
yet
in
a
way
it
was
an
ideal
tramp
a
day
in
the
exhilarating
mountain
air
passed
in
absolute
silence
without
even
the
sight
of
a
fellow
mortal
except
very
rarely
a
lone
shepherd
so
far
away
on
a
bare
brown
mountainside
as
to
be
merely
a
tiny
detail
of
the
scenery
there
was
one
drawback
also
for
the
trails
split
and
spread
at
random
across
the
world
above
at
every
opportunity
and
for
several
hours
at
a
time
i
was
not
at
all
certain
i
was
going
to
peru
at
length
i
rounded
a
lofty
spur
and
another
great
valley
opened
out
before
me
an
hour
later
i
prepared
to
present
my
note
to
the
cura
of
oña
his
two
housekeepers
attractive
chola
girls
received
me
with
the
customary
coldness
of
their
class
toward
strangers
and
the
information
that
the
padre
had
gone
to
the
ya
no
más
de
should
be
back
at
any
moment
one
of
them
which
might
mean
of
course
that
he
would
be
back
in
an
hour
or
a
week
there
was
no
one
else
in
this
hillside
of
mud
huts
around
a
dead
plaza
surrounded
by
cornfields
who
would
be
likely
to
house
me
and
i
could
only
wait
in
hungry
patience
night
was
falling
like
a
quick
curtain
at
the
end
of
a
dismal
act
when
one
of
the
stupid
damsels
admitted
probably
he
will
not
be
back
but
that
they
would
serve
a
little
something
to
eat
if
i
could
wait
awhile
i
was
already
accustomed
to
that
occupation
on
a
worktable
of
the
and
walled
corredor
among
the
parrots
that
kept
calling
the
cholas
by
name
a
chained
monkey
of
homicidal
tendencies
and
other
cural
odds
and
ends
a
meal
of
several
courses
was
at
length
set
before
me
as
rapidly
as
the
single
tin
plate
could
be
washed
and
refilled
oña
does
not
eat
bread
but
so
large
a
helping
of
was
served
that
i
succeeded
in
filling
a
coat
pocket
with
it
well
knowing
that
no
other
provisions
would
be
forthcoming
for
the
morrow
s
uninhabited
trail
as
a
food
this
mess
of
boiled
kernels
of
ripe
corn
chief
sustenance
of
the
andean
indian
on
his
travels
is
like
those
medicines
that
are
worse
than
the
ailment
they
are
designed
to
cure
then
there
was
a
plate
of
black
beans
a
corn
tamale
and
a
tasteless
preserved
fruit
all
but
with
the
or
green
peppers
with
which
all
food
in
the
andes
is
enlivened
hours
later
a
group
of
horsemen
rode
up
out
of
the
night
and
halted
before
the
casa
cural
i
rose
from
a
cramped
doze
on
a
corredor
bench
to
find
the
priest
dismounting
a
brawny
man
of
massive
frame
more
than
six
feet
tall
with
features
and
a
powerful
roman
nose
dressed
in
a
black
robe
reaching
to
his
spurs
and
a
huge
panama
hat
of
exceedingly
fine
present
no
doubt
from
some
fond
member
of
his
flock
among
the
surrounding
towered
far
above
his
companions
a
cigarette
smouldered
between
his
lips
a
week
s
growth
of
dense
black
beard
a
face
that
bore
testimony
to
long
and
deep
experience
in
worldly
matters
and
his
voice
boomed
like
quito
s
largest
yet
his
manner
was
that
syrupy
courtesy
accompanied
by
a
whining
speech
peculiar
to
the
region
he
fawned
upon
all
who
approached
him
addressing
them
with
maudlin
words
of
endearment
ah
compadrecito
oh
my
dearest
of
friends
oh
josecito
cholito
hijito
mío
a
rising
and
falling
inflection
that
made
his
speech
seem
even
more
false
and
insincere
than
it
was
in
reality
me
he
greeted
in
the
same
tone
like
a
amiguito
and
assured
me
the
casa
cural
was
henceforth
my
personal
property
expressing
his
deepest
regret
that
he
had
just
sent
to
cuenca
where
he
was
about
to
be
transferred
his
two
phonographs
and
diez
mil
pesos
worth
of
other
toys
it
was
a
typical
cural
residence
of
the
andes
the
rough
adobe
walls
of
his
cluttered
study
with
mud
benches
in
the
form
of
divans
around
them
were
almost
completely
covered
with
large
lithographs
advertising
various
brands
of
whiskey
and
cigarettes
more
than
half
of
them
showing
nude
female
figures
under
his
table
was
spread
out
to
dry
a
square
patch
of
tobacco
and
at
frequent
intervals
the
padre
reached
under
it
for
the
makings
of
a
cigarette
without
taking
his
eyes
off
his
visitors
nor
ceasing
the
flow
of
his
cadenced
endearments
illustration
plowing
for
wheat
or
corn
on
the
hacienda
of
cumbe
the
indians
work
best
in
bees
as
in
the
time
of
the
incas
the
plows
are
mere
crooked
sticks
without
a
vestige
of
iron
the
yokes
are
fastened
in
front
of
the
horns
with
rawhide
thongs
two
men
chiefly
of
indian
blood
soon
joined
us
one
the
jefe
político
and
the
other
what
might
be
called
in
english
chairman
of
the
town
council
the
former
carried
a
guitar
the
latter
a
quart
bottle
of
aguardiente
and
both
a
stimulated
gaiety
even
greater
than
that
of
the
priest
during
an
affectionate
three
hours
the
trio
toasted
each
other
alternately
in
large
glasses
of
this
concoction
after
suffering
two
or
three
rounds
of
which
i
was
forced
to
allege
a
sore
throat
the
moving
spirit
of
the
feast
was
the
priest
whose
powerful
frame
carried
his
liquor
well
and
the
evening
raged
on
amid
a
riot
of
chatter
and
the
savage
thrumming
of
the
guitar
little
more
than
the
flushed
faces
visible
in
the
atmosphere
of
cigarette
smoke
within
the
tightly
closed
room
the
cura
spoke
french
readily
having
been
in
earlier
years
an
inmate
of
the
french
monastery
of
riobamba
and
affected
it
with
me
all
the
evening
the
jefe
político
was
childishly
eager
to
hear
us
speak
that
strange
tongue
the
town
councilor
roared
with
anger
as
often
as
either
of
us
uttered
a
word
of
it
charging
that
we
were
abusing
him
under
cover
of
that
cursed
castilian
of
the
the
cura
maliciously
added
fuel
to
his
wrath
unostentatiously
keeping
the
bottle
moving
meanwhile
sending
a
boy
to
replenish
it
as
often
as
it
was
emptied
the
enraged
councilor
ended
at
last
by
staggering
out
into
the
night
and
across
the
plaza
shouting
drunkenly
that
he
was
going
for
a
gun
or
a
machete
the
other
two
followed
him
and
for
some
time
a
maudlin
bellowing
intermingled
with
the
wheedling
of
a
velvety
voice
of
rising
and
falling
cadence
awoke
the
echoes
of
the
night
gradually
subsiding
until
at
length
silence
fell
the
priest
at
last
came
slowly
back
without
a
suggestion
of
intoxication
which
he
seemed
to
lay
aside
as
he
might
his
long
black
robe
reached
under
the
table
rolled
a
cigarette
and
explained
apologetically
that
as
his
recent
companions
were
the
chief
civil
authorities
he
must
keep
on
good
terms
with
them
whatever
his
own
tastes
and
then
he
implored
me
to
spend
the
following
day
in
oña
promising
that
we
should
visit
on
muleback
the
many
historical
spots
in
the
vicinity
and
launching
into
a
learned
dissertation
on
the
history
of
the
region
oña
he
asserted
was
the
oldest
town
in
southern
ecuador
and
the
treaty
of
peace
had
been
signed
by
sucre
in
this
very
house
after
the
battle
of
tarqui
in
spite
of
the
impression
that
the
invitation
was
mere
surface
courtesy
i
finally
promised
to
remain
he
threw
his
arms
about
me
in
an
affectionate
showering
upon
me
endearing
terms
all
ending
in
the
spanish
diminutive
and
called
upon
the
housekeepers
to
spread
a
mattress
for
me
on
a
mud
divan
in
the
study
then
the
cura
who
at
least
had
the
virtue
of
living
his
life
frankly
retired
with
the
two
comely
cholas
to
an
adjoining
room
in
which
it
is
true
there
were
two
beds
and
silence
settled
down
over
the
andes
in
the
morning
i
turned
over
for
another
nap
an
hour
later
the
priest
and
his
unofficial
family
marched
in
upon
me
and
it
was
some
time
before
i
could
get
sufficient
privacy
and
liquid
mud
to
shave
and
dress
from
that
hour
until
night
i
had
little
more
than
silent
suffrance
from
the
cura
and
his
household
and
heard
not
a
reference
to
those
many
points
of
historical
importance
he
had
painted
in
such
enticing
terms
in
his
ardent
condition
of
the
night
before
tomás
á
kempis
says
a
sad
morning
often
follows
a
merry
evening
or
words
to
that
effect
but
the
cura
of
oña
had
evidently
overlooked
that
particular
quotation
an
almost
constant
stream
of
indians
and
came
to
inquire
in
soft
cadenced
voices
for
tayta
curita
who
sat
in
his
den
smoking
countless
cigarettes
and
whining
unlimited
endearments
and
blessings
on
all
comers
but
resolutely
squelching
all
applications
for
coin
of
the
realm
or
the
material
things
of
this
world
and
reaching
at
frequent
intervals
for
the
replenished
quart
bottle
about
eleven
the
two
of
us
and
a
carpenter
who
had
been
pottering
about
the
house
all
the
morning
fitting
together
two
boards
that
were
destined
never
to
fit
sat
down
in
a
corner
of
the
wide
back
corredor
of
the
casa
cural
to
a
substantial
dinner
at
which
cat
dog
parrot
and
monkey
helped
themselves
to
every
dish
as
freely
as
we
the
meal
was
adorned
with
a
jar
of
a
drink
which
the
cura
had
taught
his
cholas
to
make
after
reading
of
it
in
an
account
of
mexico
the
rest
of
the
day
drowsed
slothfully
away
amid
the
screaming
of
parrots
the
barking
of
dogs
the
shrieks
of
the
monkey
rattling
his
chain
in
all
but
successful
attempts
to
rend
and
tear
some
unwary
visitor
and
a
swarming
of
flies
that
sounded
like
a
distant
waterfall
typical
life
of
rural
ecuador
punctuated
by
the
occasional
chanting
of
the
velvety
singsong
voice
in
the
mud
church
next
door
as
my
host
hurried
through
a
mass
for
some
departed
soul
toward
sunset
the
household
was
augmented
by
a
third
plump
and
youthful
chola
who
had
been
home
on
a
visit
to
her
parental
mud
hut
among
the
hills
it
seemed
strange
that
the
casa
cural
was
so
and
slatternly
with
so
generous
a
supply
of
housekeepers
at
the
summit
beyond
the
chaotic
chasm
into
which
the
world
falls
away
below
oña
the
nature
of
the
country
changed
from
an
endless
vista
of
barren
and
often
soilless
rocks
the
entire
landscape
was
transformed
to
a
heavily
wooded
region
of
hardy
undergrowth
somewhat
like
small
bushy
oaks
at
times
almost
approaching
a
forest
a
shaggy
world
rolling
away
as
far
as
the
eye
could
follow
in
every
direction
here
and
there
was
a
larger
bush
completely
covered
with
pink
blossoms
then
the
took
gradually
to
rocking
like
a
ship
approaching
a
tempestuous
sea
until
all
at
once
it
spilled
itself
like
the
cargo
of
an
overturned
freighter
into
another
enormous
hole
in
the
earth
hazy
with
the
very
depths
of
it
the
trail
pitched
over
the
edge
with
the
rest
like
a
bit
of
flotsam
from
a
wreck
helplessly
at
the
mercy
of
the
waves
thousands
of
little
green
farms
chiefly
of
corn
with
an
indian
hut
set
in
a
corner
of
each
hung
at
sharp
angles
about
the
enclosing
walls
of
the
valley
i
had
reached
the
famous
vale
of
zaraguro

a
little
world
of
its

the
great
majority
of
its
population
is
indian

a
new
type
of
indian
of
darker
skin
and
more
independent
manner
than
those
to
the
north
still
humble
to
the
gente
decente
when
facing
them
singly
but
verging
on
insolence
when
gathered
in
groups
with
chicha
at
hand
here
each
owns
a
little
patch
of
land
and
refuses
serfdom
his
dress
is
somber
in
marked
contrast
to
the
gaudy
colors
of
his
quiteño

of
the
loose
white
panties
he
clothes
his
legs
to
the
knee
with
a
woolen
garment
and
covers
all
the
rest
of
the
body
with
a
poncho
of
the

color

immensely
thick
almost
white

to
the

of

of
the
best

ever
higher
to
the
realms
of
eternal
silence

from
the
summit
where
i
had
looked
forward
to
the
corresponding
pleasure
of
looping
as
leisurely
down
the
opposite
flank
an
atrocious

headlong
downward
to
the
narrow
valley

a
small
river

a
long
day
pouring
incessantly
with
rain
followed
the
stream
the

mounting
and
descending
rocky
headlands
with
the
monotonous
regularity
of
a
flat
even
where
the
landscape
opened
out
again
at
last
the
plain
was
in
mud
and
it
was
only
by
dint
of
a
constant
struggle
that
i
dragged
myself
and
drenched
on
the
second

never

along

the

in

spent
the
nights
on

on

where
the
customary

winked
weakly
through

i
was
overjoyed
however
to
come
upon
a
placard
announcing
that
the
municipal

was
open
to
the
public
even
at
night
as
it
promised
to
open
first
at
one
of
the
afternoon
i
was
not
surprised
to
find
it
still
locked
when
i
arrived
at
two
i
waited
a
half
hour
peering
greedily
through
the
bars
of
the
reja
at
the
long
shelves
of
books
and
maps
then
i
began
inquiries
the
adjoining
shopkeeper
expressed
unbounded
surprise
that
there
were
persons
so
ignorant
as
not
to
know
the
government
is
so
poor
it
can
not
pay
the

any
more

that
the

been
closed

in
the

of

nearly
three
centuries
ago
a
missionary
to

found
the

grinding
the
bitter

in
their
stone

swallowing
it
as
a
specific
against

do

of

in
a
certain
disdain
by
the
mass
of
his
even
while
they
are
basking
in
the
sunshine
of
his
fame
a
striking
example
of
those
rare
mortals
who
struggle
to
raise
themselves
above
the
low
level
of
their
deadening
environment
in
these
buried
cities
far
from
the
moving
modern
world
i
found
him
in
his
rambling
parlor
of
undusted
efforts
at
grandeur
its
walls
decorated
with
large
maps
of
paris
and
new
york
both
of
which
he
had
once
visited
in
an
effort
to
patent
and
place
his
invention
interspersed
with
the
customary
inartistic
family
portraits
draped
with

member
of

of
loja
s
chief
families
of
pure
spanish
blood
speaking
a
cultured
castilian
with
the
diction
of
a
man
of
books
he
was
in
appearance
a
ludicrous
mixture
of
the
typical
inventor
of
the
comic
supplements
and
of
the
stickler
for
formal
dress
scraggly
gray
whiskers
pursued
themselves
about
his
unimpressive
face
a
months
overdue
emphasized
his
narrow
shoulders
and
flat
chest
his
hands
thin
almost
to
transparency
suggested
something
weak
and
harmless
in
need
of
protection
his
once
stiff
white
shirt
was
innocent
of
buttons
and
with
his
energetic
or
more
exactly
nervous
movements
frequently
opened
to
disclose
a
flaccid
skin
and
a
catholic
charm
hanging
low
about
his
neck
a
collar
buttoned
only
at
one
end
was
adorned
with
a
cravat
that
was
not
a
cravat
but
only
a
strip
of
black
ribbon
that
floated
here
and
there
about
his
throat
his
sine

non
of
respectability
was
gray
with

with

spotted
with
the
mementoes
of
laboratory
accidents
and
the
slender
aristocratic
shoes
possessing
in
common
three
buttons
had
been
worn
completely
heelless
here
in
the
bosom
of
his
disdainful
family
he
wore
a
greasy
old
cap
later
in
the
day
i
met
him
promenading
under
the
portales
of
the
plaza
in
the
same
costume
but
for
the
added
glory
of
a
hat
of
at
least
twenty
years
of
harried
existence
his
or
workshop
overlooking
the
main
square
was
a
chaos
of
odds
and
ends
gathered
by
a
man
who
had
given
his
life
chiefly
to
the
study
of
physics
and
who
was
alternately
tinkering
at
a
score
of
inventions
in
the
absence
of
a
real
source
of
supply
his
apparatus
was
almost
entirely
or
as
he
himself
put
it
a
collection
fashioned
from
cigar
boxes
string
tin
cans
and
whatever
makeshifts
fell
in
his
way
resembling
nothing
so
much
as
the
playthings
of
some
isolated
but
inventive
farmer
s
boy
a
shoemaker
s
needle
on
the
plan
of
a
shuttle
that
was
designed
to
revolutionize
the
making
of
footwear
had
been
constructed
from
the
shell
of
a
rifle
cartridge
of
as
plebeian
materials
he
had
built
a
little
transparent
box
to
place
above
the
needle
of
a
phonograph
to
do
away
with
the
metallic
sound
of
that
in
fashion
his
phonograph
was
out
of
order
and
did
not
another
crude
apparatus
he
pointed
out
as
a
proof
that
a
sphere
revolve
on
two
axes
at
once
ball
of
yarn
representing
the
earth
was
twirled
by
a
tiny
dynamo
and
at
the
same
time
given
a
rotary
motion
by
a
string
so
on
through
all
the
realms
of
physics
which
he
taught
here
in
his
taller
several
times
a
week
to
the
boys
of
the
local
colegio
the
original
of
his
most
important
invention
was
out
of
order
and
i
was
not
favored
with
a
test
of
the
celífono
on
which
he
had
tinkered
intermittently
more
than
thirty
years
his
inventiveness
did
not
confine
itself
to
merely
physical
matters
before
i
left
he
pressed
upon
me
a
pamphlet
of
which
he
was
the
author
it
was
entitled
the
virgin
maría
in
america
before
its
discovery
by
columbus
wherein
the
writer
proved
beyond
question
to
use
his
own
words
that
the
blessed
virgin
was
not
an
unknown
personage
in
america
when
it
was
discovered
by
the
beginning
a
visionary
journey
in
canada
he
descended
step
by
step
through
all
the
western
hemisphere
proving
by
shaky
tradition
by
the
doctored
yarns
of
early
missionaries
and
by
personal
lucubrations
that
all
the
indian
tribes
had
the
tradition
of
adam
and
eve
of
the
serpent
and
the
apple
of
original
sin
and
of
a
god
born
of
a
the
fact
that
the
city
of
loja
had
published
this
masterpiece
fully
describes
its
mentality
i
had
known
him
three
or
four
days
before
the
inventor
took
me
into
his
confidence
and
whispered
that
the
invention
of
the
celífono
had
been
merely
a
means
to
an
end
that
he
had
taken
it
to
new
york
and
europe
in
the
hope
of
raising
funds
to
pursue
his
really
important
invention
which
he
had
thought
on
for
forty
years
and
already
perfected
in
his
mind
though
he
had
not
yet
begun
its
construction
this
was
a
flying
machine
that
is
neither
balloon
nor
aeroplane
perfectly
safe
and
commercially
as
nearly
as
my
unmechanical
faculties
grasped
the
situation
from
his
elaborate
explanation
it
was
a
close
replica
of
that
of
darius
green
whose
fame
has
never
reached
this
corner
of
the
andes
fortunately
there
is
no
building
in
loja
high
enough
to
bring
the
inventor
to
serious
grief
should
he
ever
succeed
in
collecting
the
materials
essential
to
the
actual
construction
of
this
perfected
child
of
his
imagination
but
his
hope
was
still
youthful
and
he
besought
my
advice
as
to
how
a
poor
inventor
could
get
his
masterpiece
before
the
world
without
being
despoiled
of
the
fruits
of
his
labors
as
in
the
case
of
the
celífono
by
the
practical
business
men
of
that
great
universe
beyond
his
horizon
i
regretted
my
ignorance
of
any
panacea
for
that
condition
carrión
is
but
a
type
of
those
closet
geniuses
who
live
toil
and
fade
away
unknown
in
the
dim
recesses
of
the
andes
men
in
some
cases
who
might
have
ranked
high
among
modern
inventors
writers
or
artists
had
their
lot
been
cast
in
happier
climes
than
in
this
leaden
environment
of
impracticability
burdened
by
enervating
superstitions
denied
the
simplest
materials
for
their
purposes
in
a
land
where
even
twine
and
are
commonly
unobtainable
and
so
lacking
in
that
grasping
so
necessary
to
front
modern
society
successfully
that
even
the
scant
fruits
of
their
labors
go
to
swell
the
already
swollen
pockets
of
more
practical
men
of
the
world
while
they
dream
on
like

loja
southernmost

by
her
endless
labyrinth
of
mountains
chapter
ix
the
wilds
of
northern
peru
i
had
been
a
full
in
ecuador
when
i
turned
my
attention
to
the
problem
of
getting
out
of
it
that
disintegration
that
tendency
for
neighboring
countries
to
hold
no
communication
between
each
other
at
which
the
american
can
not
but
marvel
in
south
america
was
here
in
full
evidence
ecuador
seemed
as
completely
cut
off
from
the
country
just
over
her
southern
boundary
as
from
europe
the
cura
of
oña
had
assured
me
that
the
one
way
to
reach
peru
from
loja
would
be
to
walk
to
puerto
bolívar
on
the
coast
take
a
to
guayaquil
then
a
big
steamer
to
paita
or
pacasmayo
only
he
who
knows
south
american
geography
well
can
appreciate
the
unconscious
humor
of
such
advice
even
the
rare
lojanos
who
admitted
it
might
be
possible
to
go
to
peru
by
land
asserted
that
i
must
walk
to
piura
which
would
have
been
to
cross
a
burning
tropical
desert
far
out
of
my
way
to
that
coast
i
was
purposely
avoiding
the
government
map
of
the
province
of
loja
was
as
faulty
and
scanty
of
information
as
the
american
one
i
carried
it
showed
a
road
leading
south
from
the
provincial
capital
into
that
labyrinth
of
mountains
through
the
villages
of
vilcabamba
and
valladolid
but
all
the
town
was
agreed
that
no
one
could
travel
in
these
modern
days
along
the
remnants
of
the
great
military
highway
of
the
incas
crawling
along
the
crest
of
the
cordillera
oriental
through
regions
for
days
utterly
uninhabited
and
well
i
knew
that
prescott
s
hanging
withe
bridges
over
awful
chasms
were
sure
to
be
out
of
repair
in
these
effeminate
times
even
where
they
ever
existed
at
length
a
few
bold
lojanos
admitted
that
i
might
be
able
to
push
on
to
the
frontier
by
way
of
gonzanamá
though
they
persisted
in
calling
it
a
terrible
undertaking
even
for
a
man
who
claimed
to
have
walked
from
quito
that
route
led
far
west
of
a
line
drawn
through
huancabamba
to
cajamarca
and
there
was
nothing
to
show
that
it
would
connect
with
any
trail
beyond
the
frontier
the
best
i
could
do
was
to
hope
i
might
be
able
to
struggle
across
to
ayavaca
in
peru
where
i
could
perhaps
get
peruvian
information
then
there
came
a
complete
division
of
opinion
as
to
the
road
to
gonzanamá
and
loja
split
into
two
irreconcilable
factions
the
one
contending
that
i
should
take
the
road
due
south
from
the
west
side
of
the
plaza
the
other
insisting
on
that
due
west
from
the
south
side
in
the
end
they
all
washed
their
hands
of
the
matter
the
rainy
season
was
nearing
its
height
sure
death
lurked
along
the
frontier
none
but
amphibious
animals
and
gringos
would
stir
forth
from
the
cozy
little
city
on
the
morning
of
april
twentieth
i
finally
took
the
south
road
it
climbed
leisurely
over
the
low
interandean
shutting
in
loja
s
concave
valley
and
falling
in
with
a
hurried
mountain
stream
raced
with
it
all
day
crossing
its
branches
sometimes
by
bridges
more
often
by
fords
the
few
arrieros
i
met
carried
rusty
old
suggesting
the
dangers
of
the
frontier
the
huts
along
the
way
grew
more
and
more
rare
and
degenerated
from
thick
adobe
walls
to
upright
reeds
carelessly
stopped
with
mud
beyond
malacatos
among
its
banana
groves
where
i
spent
the
night
on
a
plank
bench
in
the
casa
cural
of
a
young
french
priest
who
had
already
lost
the
habit
of
speaking
anything
but
spanish
the
trail
climbed
relentlessly
up
through
a
region
as
uninhabited
as
an
undiscovered
sphere
the
afternoon
was
before
the
world
opened
out
again
and
gave
a
brief
glimpse
through
the
trees
of
gonzanamá
set
out
in
three
rows
on
a
tiny
plain
untold
depths
below
raging
rains
had
torn
and
gullied
the
further
slope
until
the
five
miles
downward
was
like
descending
the
ruins
of
a
giant
s
stairway
gonzanamá
was
in
fiesta
hundreds
of
and
mestizos
with
very
little
color
in
their
garments
squatted
about
the
church
and
casa
cural
they
were
a
people
as
simple
and
unsophisticated
as
children
it
was
viernes
santo
good
friday
and
all
the
town
gathered
around
to
see
me
eat
the
meat
a
pious
old
woman
served
me
with
a
shrug
of
her
shoulders
when
i
scorned
her
warning
not
to
anger
the
saints
and
dispersed
prophesying
an
early
calamity
to
me
on
the
road
ahead
when
i
arose
apparently
uninjured
the
son
of
the
teniente
político
in
whose
house
i
was
the
honored
guest
in
so
far
as
their
means
made
honoring
possible
proved
to
be
an
old
acquaintance
a
medical
student
of
quito
home
on
his
vacation
he
was
already
the
chief
practicing
physician
of
the
region
on
his
journey
from
the
capital
he
had
performed
a
score
of
operations
among
them
one
with
a
for
abscess
of
the
liver
the
room
i
occupied
which
was
also
his
place
of
consultation
the
family
parlor
the
municipal
offices
and
his
own
sleeping
quarters
was
invaded
by
a
constant
stream
of
uncomplaining
infirmities
outside
the
entire
population
marched
in
procession
until
midnight
attended
a
service
in
the
adobe
church
and
wandered
the
three
streets
with
throbbing
tomtoms
and
the
gaiety
imbibed
from
bottles
until
the
eastern
horizon
paled
to
gray
the
practicing
medical
student
did
not
take
to
his
bed
until
four
and
an
hour
later
he
arose
to
set
me
on
my
way
forcing
upon
me
with
regal
eloquence
a
can
of
salmon
from
europe
your
own
land
to
be
opened
only
on
easter
sunday
only
those
rare
mortals
who
have
jaunted
in
the
andes
can
have
any
conception
of
the
heights
i
scaled
the
bottomless
quebradas
through
which
i
tore
my
way
the
streams
i
forded
and
the
paths
that
faded
out
under
my
feet
during
that
day
one
of
these
last
had
dragged
me
remorselessly
over
every
manner
of
ruggedness
when
well
on
in
the
afternoon
it
disappeared
at
the
door
of
a
hut
the
trails
of
the
andes
do
not
run
merely
from
town
to
town
but
from
hovel
to
hovel
like
foraging
soldiers
giving
the
traveler
a
zigzag
course
that
at
least
trebles
the
distance
i
was
prowling
about
this
apparently
unoccupied
human
kennel
striving
to
pick
up
the
scent
again
when
i
was
set
upon
by
three
unusually
large
aggressive
curs
i
did
my
best
to
drive
them
off
with
sticks
and
stones
but
when
there
remained
no
other
alternative
i
drew
my
weapon
and
sent
the
largest
to
his
happy
instantly
a
crashing
of
the
bushes
sounded
high
up
in
a
jungled
patch
above
and
the
angry
voice
of
an
unseen
countryman
screamed
in
the
dialect
of
the
region
scoundrel
you
ll
pay
me
for
my
dog
caramba
crime
is
frequently
immune
so
near
an
international
boundary
and
i
rounded
the
hillside
cautiously
my
cocked
revolver
in
hand
but
the
bellowing
of
the
invisible
native
was
soon
swallowed
up
behind
me
and
only
the
oppressive
silence
of
the
mountain
solitude
surrounded
me
once
more
it
was
evident
that
i
should
not
reach
the
frontier
perhaps
not
even
shelter
before
dark
when
at
some
distance
off
in
a
setting
of
primeval
forest
solitude
i
was
astonished
to
catch
sight
of
a
large
hacienda
house
a
gaunt
rambling
building
that
suggested
some
starving
creature
lost
in
the
wilderness
almost
as
i
reached
it
a
broke
with
a
crash
and
set
a
hundred
brooks
tearing
their
way
down
the
swift
mountainside
on
which
the
building
clung
the
house
was
locked
and
unoccupied
two
indian
boys
of
eight
and
twelve
were
huddled
under
the
projecting
eaves
of
a
outbuilding
across
the
cobbled
yard
for
a
full
hour
they
answered
my
every
question
with
el
patrón
no
stá
uttered
in
the
dull
monotonous
voice
of
some
mechanical
instrument
i
cajoled
them
at
last
to
start
a
on
the

there
over
the
scanty
fire
prowling
about
the
hacienda

when
the
storm
slackened
i
found
in
one
end
a
room
that
was
locked
with
a
piece
of
string

to
the

speechless

stood
a
bedstead
with
a
rough
board
flooring
dusk
was
thickening
into
wet
night
when
the
indian
boys
crept
up
to
where
i
sat
on
the
broad
veranda
overlooking
a
yet
indistinct
vista
of
wooded
mountains
and
valleys
to
assure
me
i
should
be
killed
and
robbed
during
the
night

are
all
so
poor

when
a
rich

only
a
few
days
since
a
traveler
was
killed
down
in
the
valley
there
last
i
glanced
over
my
and
bespattered
form
in
vain
for
the
evidences
of
wealth
so
patent
to
other
eyes
yet
i
could
not
but
recall
the
carcass
of
a
dog
a
few
miles
back
and
the
golden
weight
of
the
band
of
my
trousers
reminded
me
that
several
fellows
had
halted
awhile
under
the
hacienda
eaves
during
the
height
of
the
storm
and
slipped
away
somewhere
into
the
night
moreover
the
prophesied
destruction
of
all
ecuador
by
earthquake
was
at
hand
for
the
morrow
would
it
ever

plainly
all
the
signs
pointed
to
an
exciting
night

the
on
which
i
feasted
upon

the
indians
of

are
different
both
in
type
and

from
the
meeker
types
of
quito
and

my
small
faith
in
prophecy
did
not
however
hinder
me
from
making
sure
that
my
revolver
was
and
hung
on
a
the
window
of
the
high
above
the

only
a

from
the

enough
to
wake
me
in
case
of
attempted
intrusion
i
found
several
old
sacks
to
serve
as
mattress
and
stripping
off
my
day
garb
slipped
into
the
woolen
and
socks
that
made
up
my
sleeping
costume
however
much
i
might
reduce
my
load
in
my
indifference
to
outward
appearance
i
would
not
have
been
without
this
complete
change
for
the
night
if
i
had
had
to
make
two
trips
to
fetch
them
i
had
no
matches
and
the
boys
had
been
unable
to
produce
a
candle
the
rain
had
died
down
and
everywhere
utter
stillness
reigned
i
rolled
up
in
my
poncho
and
fell
asleep
a
suspicious
noise
woke
me
in
what
was
probably
a
few
minutes
scores
of
mice
were
scampering
over
the
uneven
floor
squeaking
hilariously
by
the
time
i
had
grown
accustomed
to
the
sound
i
had
dozed
off
again
from
a
chaotic
dream
of
crowded
and
varied
incidents
i
came
gradually
to
the
consciousness
of
a
rattling
at
the
wooden
i
sprang
across
the
floor
and
peered
out
into
the
unfathomable
mountain
night
but
i
have
never
been
certain
whether
the
sound
i
heard
was
the
hurrying
of
bare
feet
in
soft
mud
and
the
tail
of
a
whisper
or
the
creature
of
a
startled
imagination
with
thirty
miles
in
my
legs
i
was
in
no
mood
to
sit
up
waiting
for
trouble
and
making
sure
once
more
that
my
revolver
was
within
easy
reach
i
set
the
creaking
again
my
next
consciousness
was
of
a
dawn
bright
with
the
promise
of
an
unclouded
day
peering
in
upon
me
through
the
and
of
the
indian
boys
whispering
through
the
barricaded
door
to
know
whether
i
was
still
alive
and
ready
for
the
two
raw
eggs
they
had
collected
an
erratic
mountain
path
that
it
was
not
easy
to
distinguish
from
the
beds
of
mountain
brooks
and
generally
deep
in
mud
clambered
without
apparent
direction
into
wooden
mountain
ranges
sometimes
plunging
headlong
down
through
bottomless
valleys
sometimes
flanking
them
in
enormous
horseshoe
curves
how
i
pushed
on
all
the
morning
without
getting
lost
i
do
not
know
for
certainly
there
were
a
score
of
times
when
there
was
no
plausible
excuse
for
picking
the
right
one
of
a
paths
i
sighted
several
miserable
huts
and
once
a
village
but
these
were
never
near
the
trail
and
when
i
decided
to
apply
for
food
at
the
next
one
another
of
those
sudden
changes
of
climate
left
the
dripping
forested
mountains
behind
me
and
underfoot
was
a
world
which
even
the
hardy
dwellers
of
two
decrepit
huts
had
long
since
abandoned
in
southern
ecuador
and
northern
peru
the
andes
break
up
and
all
but
disintegrate
there
are
still
plenty
of
mountains
but
true
to
their
environment
they
lack
and
do
not
stick
together
sufficiently
to
give
the
traveler
footing
upon
them
directly
before
me
ecuador
fell
unfathomably
away
to
the
macará
like
an
auburn
hair
across
a
painted
landscape
while
beyond
to
appearances
unattainable
peru
lay
piled
into
the
southern
sky
it
was
as
if
the
carpenter
of
the
universe
had
said
let
here
be
the
dividing
line
between
two
distrusting
nations
and
had
smote
the
earth
with
his
mightiest
tool
over
all
the
scene
was
a
utterly
uninhabited
silence
as
of
some
valley
of
desolation
from
which
all
life
had
forever
fled
the
trail
down
which
i
jolted
had
exploded
into
a
score
of
barely
visible
paths
that
spread
in
every
direction
over
the
drear
hills
it
seemed
as
if
once
near
the
frontier
every
traveler
either
dashed
blindly
forward
to
get
quickly
across
it
unseen
or
lost
his
courage
and
fled
back
into
the
interior
i
set
a
due
course
for
the
river
almost
directly
below
at
high
noon
my
every
joint
jarred
loose
i
stood
at
last
on
the
extreme
edge
of
ecuador
the
waters
of
the
macará
lapping
at
my
blistered
feet
and
on
every
hand
a
blazing
utterly
unpeopled
desert
with
nowhere
the
vestige
of
track
or
trail
the
river
nearly
a
wide
swollen
by
the
rains
above
raged
swiftly
by
a
barrier
of
unknown
possibilities
its
surface
covered
everywhere
with
ripples
suggested
that
it
was
less
deep
than
broad
i
piled
my
baggage
on
the
shore
and
stripping
to
the
waist
waded
in
the
powerful
current
all
but
swept
me
off
my
feet
and
the
water
quickly
reached
my
upper
garments
i
returned
to
strip
entirely
strapped
my
revolver
about
my
chest
and
picking
a
stout
stick
from
the
undergrowth
fought
my
way
inch
by
inch
to
the
opposite
shore
but
i
had
to
go
back
to
ecuador
for
my
possessions
it
required
five
crossings
trusting
only
a
few
of
them
at
a
time
to
the
treacherous
current
and
more
than
an
hour
of
unremitting
vigilance
before
i
had
landed
my
bedraggled
belongings
at
last
on
the
shores
of
peru
more
forlorn
than
at
the
landing
of
pizarro
and
his
by
careful
calculation
checked
by
native
record
i
was
miles
south
of
quito
and
from
the
colombian
border
under
some
barbed
bushes
i
picked
a
spot
as
nearly
shaded
as
could
be
found
along
the
desert
bank
and
having
shaved
that
i
might
enter
the
new
republic
in
disguise
dipped
up
a
can
of
macará
and
fell
upon
the
the
indian
boys
had
sold
me
and
the
can
of
salmon
which
i
had
preserved
for
easter
sunday
only
by
the
exercise
of
sternest
it
was
three
fourths
full
of
a
pale
watery
liquid
in
which
floated
dejectedly
a
few
small
lumps
of
what
had
once
long
ago
been
carp
or
luckily
there
was
a
difference
in
the
size
of
the
cans
so
that
i
could
generally
tell
whether
i
was
drinking
salmon
or
the
macará
then
when
i
had
written
up
my
notes
i
proceeded
to
turn
the
meal
into
a
banquet
in
comparison
by
reading
that
chapter
of
prescott
recounting
what
pizarro
and
his
did
not
find
to
eat
on
their
first
landing
being
far
from
mortal
ken
in
an
uncharted
crack
of
the
earth
it
may
be
fancied
i
should
have
been
eager
to
hurry
on
somehow
now
i
had
reached
peru
there
came
over
me
a
languorous
indifference
to
further
advance
the
sun
was
low
before
i
rose
and
turned
my
attention
to
the
task
of
discovering
my
whereabouts
i
found
myself
gazing
along
a
dreary
sheer
grown
only
with
sparse
bristling
cactus
shrubs
that
refused
a
seeking
a
place
to
insert
my
toes
and
start
southward
leisurely
but
decidedly
i
grasped
the
first
possibility
and
for
an
hour
or
more
might
have
been
there
been
eyes
to
goat
along
the
face
of
calcined
hills
that
fell
so
abruptly
into
the
racing
macará
that
they
came
a
score
of
times
uncomfortably
near
taking
me
with
them
during
that
hour
i
advanced
fully
five
hundred
a
direction
i
did
not
care
to
cactus
thorns
at
every
step
and
ended
down
at
the
edge
of
the
river
again
exactly
as
far
into
peru
as
when
i
had
begun
the
struggle
upward
an
hour
before
here
were
a
few
yards
of
level
shore
and
when
i
had
drunk
the
stream
perceptibly
lower
i
made
my
way
along
until
i
came
upon
a
labyrinth
of
that
one
which
most
nearly
agreed
with
my
compass
turned
due
east
and
crawled
off
through
the
bushes
as
if
fearful
of
being
followed
and
left
me
standing
pathless
in
a
maze
of
barren
hills
tearing
my
way
over
them
by
dead
reckoning
now
struggling
to
a
summit
from
which
stretched
vistas
of
more
hills
now
crashing
with
lacerated
skin
down
into
another
desert
valley
where
a
few
wild
browsed
on
the
scanty
leaves
of
bristling
bushes
i
surmounted
again
and
again
the
same
identical
scene
of
dreary
nothingness
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
beyond
the
region
was
waterless
evidently
i
was
doomed
to
suffer
that
hell
of
the
desert
traveler
an
thirst
for
dusk
was
already
thickening
the
very
leaves
of
the
invariably
thorny
bushes
were
shrivelled
and
brown
even
the
air
seemed
wholly
devoid
of
moisture
then
suddenly
as
i
tore
my
way
to
another
tangled
summit
there
sounded
faintly
far
off
to
the
right
the
sweetest
music
known
to
the
tropical
wanderer
babble
of
running
water
i
plunged
down
through
the
militant
vegetation
to
where
a
clear
little
river
was
hurrying
down
along
a
bed
several
times
too
large
for
it
to
join
the
parent
macará
enormous
boulders
and
tumbled
rocks
bordered
the
stream
in
the
tail
of
the
day
i
stumbled
along
up
it
jealous
of
being
separated
from
it
as
from
a
beloved
being
and
when
night
called
a
halt
i
stacked
my
belongings
and
spread
my
poncho
on
the
stony
bank
with
its
prattle
in
my
ears
that
it
should
not
escape
unheard
during
the
night
the
brigands
reputed
to
infest
the
frontier
had
faded
away
into
the
nebulous
realms
of
fiction
i
would
almost
have
invited
robbery
for
an
opportunity
to
inquire
my
whereabouts
but
the
stream
muffled
my
movements
and
the
munching
of
the
lump
of
crude
sugar
and
when
i
had
listened
awhile
to
the
singing
of
the
tropical
night
and
watched
the
fireflies
coming
with
their
lanterns
to
look
me
over
i
fell
asleep
uncovered
and
but
slightly
dressed
so
warm
was
this
sunken
chasm
of
the
andes
the
fate
of
serving
as
to
platoons
of
tropical
insects
robbed
me
of
the
sound
sleep
the
lullaby
of
the
stream
should
have
afforded
dawn
found
me
emerging
from
a
dip
and
when
i
had
disciplined
a
stomach
that
seemed
sure
to
have
its
plaints
unheeded
for
the
rest
of
the
day
at
least
by
eating
bit
by
bit
the
remaining
lump
of
rapadura
i
took
up
the
serious
problem
of
how
to
get
somewhere
else
the
ghost
of
a
path
crossed
the
stream
not
far
above
but
soon
played
the
stale
joke
of
fading
to
a
goat
trail
then
into
thin
air
and
left
me
to
tear
my
way
back
to
the
stream
this
i
noted
came
down
more
or
less
from
the
south
and
i
set
out
along
it
determined
to
push
as
far
up
country
as
possible
for
several
hours
i
had
explored
my
way
more
or
less
southward
crossing
the
wandering
stream
every
few
yards
by
jumps
from
rock
to
rock
when
i
was
suddenly
startled
by
the
sight
of
human
beings
a
indian
woman
in
some
remnants
of
garments
a
child
astride
her
back
a
boy
at
her
heels
appeared
from
nowhere
in
the
with
a
laconic
greeting
she
led
the
way
once
she
took
to
the
jungled
plain
beside
it
and
sent
the
boy
up
a
tree
to
knock
down
some
oranges
down
in
the
again
the
god
of
the
incas
poured
down
his
perpendicular
rays
like
molten
lead
at
length
the
woman
mumbled
a
few
words
in
a
monotone
pointed
out
a
faint
path
up
the
face
of
the
eastern
sand
cliff
in
which
hundreds
of
screaming
parrakeets
had
their
nests
grasped
the
coin
i
held
out
to
her
and
glided
noiselessly
away
into
the
wilderness
the
path
disappeared
even
sooner
than
i
had
expected
i
clambered
up
several
more
perpendicular
miles
only
to
descend
and
lose
myself
in
a
quebrada
inch
by
inch
i
tore
my
way
through
the
densest
wilderness
of
briars
and
brambles
struggling
to
release
the
bundle
on
my
shoulders
after
i
had
myself
escaped
ever
on
the
watch
for
snakes
and
wild
animals
without
real
food
for
days
burning
with
tropical
thirst
my
hand
to
hand
conflict
with
the
jungle
was
near
a
when
there
appeared
far
above
me
three
scattered
indian
huts
a
precipitous
ravine
armed
to
the
teeth
lay
between
i
dived
down
into
it
to
emerge
almost
an
hour
afterward
torn
bleeding
and
smeared
with
earth
at
the
edge
of
another
and
hitherto
unseen
jungled
chasm
backed
by
a
nearly
impassable
patch
of
uncultivated
my
legs
were
as
ropes
of
sand
when
i
approached
an
indian
in
his
hut
door
but
i
set
up
a
stern
outward
appearance
to
suggest
what
might
happen
if
he
refused
me
food
and
drink
though
expressionless
as
all
his
race
he
proved
unusually
tractable
and
soon
brought
out
to
where
i
sat
in
the
shade
against
the
eastern
a
steaming
gourdful
of
the
ordinarily
despised
yuca
and
what
seemed
to
be
very
young
pork
i
had
the
dish
before
a
bone
too
tiny
for
such
an
origin
caused
me
to
look
up
inquiringly
cui
said
the
indian
laconically
though
i
had
often
heard
them
squeaking
about
the
earth
floors
of
wayside
huts
it
was
my
first
taste
of
to
this
day
the
chief
meat
of
the
andean
indian
i
think
it
was
not
entirely
due
to
my
prolonged
fast
that
i
found
it
more
palatable
than
pork
but
small
distressingly
small
even
after
the
indian
s
mate
had
added
several
steaming
rolls
of
crushed
green
corn
wrapped
in
husks
the
to
ayavaca
lay
in
plain
sight
across
the
gully
and
the
town
according
to
the
indian
was
but
two
leagues
off
but
the
andean
traveler
must
learn
not
to
let
his
hopes
grow
buoyant
and
playful
and
to
remember
that
two
leagues
from
the
lips
of
an
aboriginal
is
as
apt
to
mean
a
hard
day
s
travel
as
an
hour
s
stroll
never
once
did
the
royal
highway
pause
in
its
climb
into
the
lofty
range
ahead
my
spirits
rose
and
fell
with
each
opportunity
to
inquire
the
distance
within
two
hours
i
had
been
answered
two
leagues
six
leagues
four
hours
ya
no

todavía
stá
retiradita
ah
it
is
far
away
patrón
and
more
than
two
tambos
from
the
inca
word
for
inn
or
seems
to
mean
about
a
half
day
s
travel
sunset
found
me
far
up
on
a
great
bleak
tableland
a
rolling
broken
world
wherein
was
no
suggestion
of
a
town
stretching
away
on
all
sides
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
even
in
the
transparent
air
of
these
heights
beyond
the
trail
passed
close
to
a
large
tiled
house
where
a
barefoot
man
of
indian
type
though
white
of
skin
as
myself
answered
my
request
for
posada
by
silently
spreading
a
small
square
of
cloth
on
a
log
under
the
projecting
eaves
and
went
on
with
his
task
of
mending
with
an
adz
the
crooked
stick
that
served
him
as
plow
an
enamelled
sign
on
the
announcing
it
an
estanco
de
sal
was
the
only
outward
evidence
that
i
had
left
ecuador
behind
in
peru
salt
like
tobacco
is
a
government
monopoly
sold
only
in
licensed
shops
near
me
several
thinly
attired
women
were
balling
newly
dyed
yarn
and
children
were
sprawling
about
the
ground
with
goats
chickens
and
yellow
curs
a
heavy
rain
was
falling
uncomfortable
as
was
my
position
i
could
do
nothing
else
than
keep
it
it
was
not
that
the
family
was
indifferent
or
merely
that
i
had
reached
what
to
their
apathetic
way
of
life
was
a
happy
state
on
a
log
under
the
eaves
and
it
would
hardly
have
been
possible
to
explain
to
them
that
something
else
would
have
been
needed
for
perfect
comfort
the
man
was
plainly
of
kindly
temperament
with
some
education
of
a
sort
yet
i
was
left
to
squat
on
the
log
until
black
night
had
settled
down
without
even
an
opportunity
to
remove
the
outer
evidence
of
the
gaunt
and
strenuous
days
behind
well
after
dark
a
girl
set
before
me
a
little
wooden
box
covered
it
with
a
cloth
and
served
me
an
egg
soup
followed
by
a
hot
stew
of
yuca
and
beans
gradually
the
family
advanced
from
silence
to
latin
garrulousness
by
the
time
i
had
been
invited
inside
and
given
one
of
several
bare
divans
of
reeds
set
into
the
mud
walls
the
conversation
i
had
sought
in
vain
to
set
going
during
the
first
hours
ran
on
unchecked
until
long
after
i
would
have
been
asleep
a
dense
fog
enveloping
the
mountainside
turned
to
rain
as
i
waded
away
in
the
morning
only
by
waiting
hours
could
i
have
gotten
anything
more
than
the
aguita
a
cup
of
hot
water
with
a
bit
of
rapadura
melted
in
it
on
which
i
set
out
for
whatever
the
new
day
had
in
store
i
had
only
the
height
of
the
world
before
me
for
hours
i
strained
upward
into
ever
cooler
green
mountains
reeking
mud
underfoot
with
some
travel
yet
always
a
sense
of
solitude
even
just
over
the
next
knoll
beyond
a
passing
group
once
i
met
a
blind
traveler
picking
his
way
quite
swiftly
with
his
stick
along
the
slippery
descending
mountain
road
by
noon
i
was
far
up
where
the
rivers
are
born
fog
and
clouds
hiding
all
but
the
immediate
world
about
me
all
the
hunger
of
the
past
days
seemed
to
have
accumulated
until
i
felt
like
some
starving
beast
of
prey
ready
to
pounce
pitilessly
upon
whatever
fell
in
my
way
just
beyond
the
the
cold
pass
at
the
summit
of
the
climb
i
came
upon
a
house
of
considerable
size
half
skating
half
wading
down
to
the
door
i
found
an
old
and
a
young
woman
of
much
indian
blood
squatting
in
the
kitchen
near
a
large
steaming
kettle
over
the
familiar
of
the
andes
no
hay
absolutamente
nada
they
replied
unfeelingly
i
stepped
in
swung
off
my
load
and
showing
peruvian
silver
announced
that
i
had
come
to
stay
until
they
had
sold
me
food
the
women
sat
motionless
with
that
passiveness
the
indian
so
often
depends
upon
to
drive
off
importunate
persons
i
offered
any
reasonable
price
for
one
of
the
chickens
wandering
about
the
room
the
older
woman
mumbled
that
clumsy
threadbare
lie
son
ajenos
they
belong
to
someone
else
to
my
suggestion
of
roasted
plantains
she
answered
that
she
was
ill
when
i
inquired
the
contents
of
the
kettle
both
took
refuge
in
the
exasperating
silence
that
is
the
last
weapon
of
their
race
a
certain
amount
of
patience
is
a
virtue
too
much
is
an
asininity
i
picked
the
kettle
off
the
fire
raked
from
the
ashes
one
of
the
roasting
plantains
found
a
tin
plate
and
a
wooden
spoon
stuck
behind
a
sapling
beam
of
the
mud
wall
and
retired
again
to
the
block
of
wood
on
which
i
had
been
seated
the
pair
watched
me
in
stolid
silence
when
i
had
filled
the
plate
the
younger
one
rose
to
carry
off
the
kettle
i
requested
her
in
the
voice
of
an
general
commanding
a
widely
scattered
regiment
to
leave
it
where
it
was
until
i
had
had
my
fill
and
the
pair
fled
precipitously
from
the
room
flinging
over
their
shoulders
some
threat
of
calling
the
man
of
the
house
i
knew
the
andean
indian
too
well
to
fear
trouble
but
turned
my
face
to
the
door
and
loosened
my
revolver
in
its
holster
the
kettle
contained
a
stew
of
beans
and
corn
sufficient
to
have
fed
a
dozen
men
six
of
them
might
still
have
feasted
on
what
was
left
when
i
tossed
a
easily
four
times
the
whole
kettle
s
worth
into
the
empty
plate
and
marched
on
down
the
reeking
mountainside
had
i
but
known
it
however
i
might
have
avoided
resorting
to
force
barely
a
mile
beyond
appeared
ayavaca
a
dismal
and
orderless
collection
of
gloomy
adobe
tiled
houses
sprawling
on
the
edge
of
what
evidently
would
have
been
a
great
valley
on
a
clear
day
and
literally
running
with
red
mud
i
skated
down
into
the
plaza
and
marching
into
the
open
office
of
the
subprefect
sent
the
bedraggled
soldier
on
guard
to
announce
my
arrival
a
gaping
group
of
awkward
mountaineers
quickly
surrounded
me
but
with
them
arrived
several
white
men
in
modern
garb
one
of
whom
announced
himself
subprefect
of
the
province
of
ayavaca
entirely
at
my
service
i
displayed
my
american
and
ecuadorian
documents
requesting
him
to
take
official
cognizance
of
my
entry
into
peru
and
expressed
my
august
desire
to
rent
for
a
day

two

andean

to
specify

be
handed

you
are
in
your
own
house
replied
the
subprefect
assuming
the
attitude
of
a
sovereign
receiving
credentials
from
an
ambassador

have
only

a

was
soon
spread
on
the
official
government
desk
and
less
than
an
hour
after
requisitioning
rations
in
the
mountain
hut
i
was
sitting
with
the
provincial
commander
and
his
assistants
before
an
abundance
of
native
viands
that
included
even
the
luxury
of
wheat
bread
for
i
had
chanced
to
arrive
just
in
time
for
the
banquet
offered
by
the
town
to
its
new
ruler
in
honor
of
his
inauguration
but
alas
i
had
gained
nothing
in
comfort
by
coming
to
peru
the
available
chamber
in
my
own
house
proved
to
be
a
den
adjoining
the
subprefect
s
quarters
the
provincial
room
it
was
only
by
much
cajolery
that
i
finally
got
it
furnished
with
a
narrow
plank
bench
and
a
pair
of
ragged
but
at
least
i
could
read
by
night
such
literature
as
i
chanced
to
have
with
depriving
the
town
of
one
of
its
few
when
a
soldier
came
to
distribute
them
in
the

life
was
dismal
at
best
in
ayavaca
the
cold
and
clammy
downpour
continued
unabated
while
i
developed
my
exposed
films
in
water
supplied
by
an
eavestrough
the
population
blocked
the
doorway
of
my
room
making
every
exit
and
entry
like
boarding
a
subway
train
in
the
rush
hour
there
were
no
real
shops
in
the
dreary
mountain
town
but
only
gloomy
mud
huts
where
a
few
products
were
unofficially
sold
the
one
sidewalk
was
taken
up
by
drenched
and
downcast
asses
forcing
pedestrians
to
splash
through
the
unpaved
street

products

the

were
not
high
priced

the
most
plentiful
product
of
the
five
cents
a
live

fifteen
but
it
was
always
easier
to
pay
the
price
than
to
find
the
chicken
for
sale
commerce
was
on
the
basis
and
he
who
would
purchase

be
well
acquainted
with

only
liquor
was
to
be
had
in
abundance
the
provincial
officials
from
my
host
down
to
the
village
were
more
or
less
intoxicated
from
to
midnight
in
that
state
frankness
protruded
through
their
racial
courtesy
and
they
were
divided
in
their
assertions
between
the
opinion
that
i
was
a
spy
sent
out
by
my
government
and
the
conviction
that
i
had
been
offered
some
colossal
prize
for
covering
the
world
on
foot
it
was
with
difficulty
that
i
avoided
sinking
into
the
general
intoxication
whenever
two
or
three
are
gathered
together
in
peru
it
is
the
custom
for
one
of
the
group
to
fill
a
glass
from
the
inevitable
peruvian
aguardiente

no
harmless
ask

to

tal
fulano
and
proceeds
to
drink
the
same
health
of
his
nearest
companion
and
so
on
round
and
round
the
circle
to
infinity
and
complete
insobriety
the
inexperienced
gringo
who
fails
in
the
etiquette
of
this
custom
whatever
the
number
of
rounds
is
looked
upon
with
much
the
same
contempt
as
the
american
who
lets
his
saloon
companions
set
em
up
repeatedly
without
offering
to
do
so
himself
and
runs
the
risk
of
having
an
incensed
subprefect
too
far
gone
in
frankness
turn
upon
him
and
invite
him
to
make
his
home
elsewhere
every
minute
of
the
day
following
my
arrival
it
rained
slackening
somewhat
at
rare
intervals
only
to
begin
again
with
a
roar
that
sounded
like
an
avalanche
down
a
nearby
mountainside
hours
later
my
films
were
as
wet
as
when
first
hung
up
water
and
mud
invaded
even
our
minds
rivers
of
liquid
mud
raced
down
every
street
and
across
the
broad
plaza
not
once
during
the
day
did
the
eye
catch
a
hint
of
the
great
valley
on
the
edge
of
which
ayavaca
is
perched
the
few
residents
forced
to
go
out
of
doors
wore
wooden
clog
overshoes
something
like
the
footwear
of
the
japanese
that
increased
the
wearer
s
height
by
a
or
more
the
majority
huddled
in
their
dreary
mud
houses
crowding
into
the
low
doorways
to
stare
after
me
when
i
passed
commenting
aloud
on
my
raison
d
être
the
postmaster
of
ayavaca
was
a
comely
young
woman
of
considerable
indian
blood
her
office
scattered
promiscuously
about
the
baked
of
her
parents
i
had
concluded
to
mail
the
films
and
notebooks
on
hand
rather
than
risk
their
loss
or
destruction
in
what
promised
to
be
difficult
going
ahead
and
having
ransacked
the
town
for
the
necessary
wrapping
paper
and
tied
the
package
with
government
tape
i
presented
it
for
registry
it
seemed
better
to
make
a
clear
breast
of
the
matter
than
to
risk
the
pandoric
curiosity
of
the
ayavaca
postal
system
and
i
explained
that
while
the
contents
was
of
vast
value
to
me
and
the
future
history
of
peru
it
was
of
none
whatever
to
anyone
else
stamps
were
at
length
found
in
the
drawer
of
the
hand
on
the
earth
floor
a
native
ink
was
brewed
over
the
in
the
kitchen
for
the
imprinting
of
the
official
seal
dug
out
from
a
chest
of
stockings
and
feminine
and
after
a
social
call
of
more
than
an
hour
s
duration
i
shook
hands
with
the
entire
family
twice
with
the
herself
and
left
with
her
repeated
reassurance
ringing
in
my
ears
no
tenga
no
sleep
over
it
señor
it
will
go
safely
to
europe
and
the
united
states
without
being
some
time
after
dark
the
rain
having
at
last
left
off
with
sullen
grace
i
was
limbering
up
my
legs
for
an
early
start
in
the
morning
when
i
chanced
to
pass
the
the
door
was
closed
but
this
was
one
of
the
few
houses
of
ayavaca
boasting
a
without
glass
unknown
to
most
towns
of
the
with
wooden
bars
inside
gathered
about
an
apathetic
candle
sat
the
and
her
entire
family
the
open
package
in
her
my
films
from
hand
to
hand
and
puzzling
in
vain
over
my
notebooks
with
a
leisureliness
that
showed
they
had
settled
down
to
make
the
most
of
a
long
evening
s
entertainment
my
first
impulse
to
snatch
open
the
door
was
succeeded
by
reflection
knowing
the
extreme
sensibility
of
these
andean
townsmen
i
suspected
that
were
my
discovery
known
to
her
the
would
be
more
than
apt
out
of
pique
to
lose
or
destroy
the
cause
of
her
undoing
before
i
could
recover
them
from
government
possession
i
swallowed
the
impulse
and
splashed
on
through
the
night
months
afterward
i
had
word
that
the
package
reached
the
addressee
in
perfect
condition
though
in
disorder
with
little
more
information
than
that
the
next
town
i
must
hunt
out
of
the
wilderness
was
huancabamba
i
slid
down
the
red
slopes
from
ayavaca
now
and
then
glancing
back
to
wonder
what
excuse
even
spaniards
could
have
considered
sufficient
to
found
a
town
in
such
a
location
the
subprefect
far
from
providing
the
indian
guide
and
carrier
he
had
so
often
promised
in
his
cups
had
bade
me
adiós
from
his
bed
with
the
cheering
assurance
that
i
was
bound
soon
to
lose
my
way
and
perish
my
load
was
several
pounds
heavier
than
on
my
arrival
for
i
had
added
to
it
not
only
a
block
of
rapadura
and
seventeen
loaves
of
a
huge
chunk
of
fresh
beef
even
my
money
had
become
a
burden
again
for
instead
of
the
bills
of
ecuador
my
must
now
be
carried
in
silver
the
daily
of
ayavaca
had
appeared
the
evening
before
with
an
astonishing
history
of
the
town
s
distinguished
guest
honoring
me
with
the
title
of
that
intrepid
explorer
a
designation
which
the
subprefect
made
use
of
in
his
official
orders
to
his
subordinates
along
the
way
and
which
copied
from
one
document
to
another
was
destined
to
cling
to
me
all
the
length
of
peru
my
eye
never
fell
upon
it
that
i
did
not
recall
the
native
dishes
i
was
so
often
forced
to
delve
into
during
the
journey

the

lost
my
possessions
immense
gray
curtains
of
fog
left
me
only
instinct
and
my
compass
by
which
to
choose
between
the
faint
sandy
paths
that
split
and
forked
at
every
opportunity
the
trail
i
happened
to
take
zigzagged
quickly
down
into
the
bed
of
a
snarling
mountain
stream
between
sheer
rock
walls
choked
with
tough
thorny
undergrowth
along
which
it
sprang
back
and
forth
from
rock
to
rock
dragging
me
in
pursuit
through
an
endless
tangle
of
vegetation
often
by
vaulted
tunnels
through
which
i
could
only
tear
my
way
by
creeping
on
all
fours
by
dusk
it
had
widened
sufficiently
to
give
the
path
foothold
along
one
bank
and
when
darkness
brought
me
to
a
halt
i
found
space
under
a
scraggly
tree
to
spread
my
poncho
in
my
pack
the
seventeen
loaves
of
bread
had
amalgamated
with
the
crude
sugar
and
formed
a
coating
about
the
boiled
beef
i
stowed
away
in
my
hat
for
safekeeping
the
few
more
or
less
whole
loaves
and
fell
upon
the
pulp
that
remained
it
was
a
dry
meal
for
all
the
rain
though
the
stream
close
below
sounded
tantalizingly
in
my
ears
all
the
night
through
an
impenetrable
jungle
cut
me
off
from
it
and
only
the
few
wild
lemons
i
had
picked
along
the
way
ministered
to
the
of
a
long
day
s
tramp
the
pleasure
of
dressing
at
dawn
in
garments
still
dripping
wet
was
enhanced
by
the
discovery
that
a
colony
of
red
ants
appointing
a
had
formed
a
from
my
hat
to
their
neighboring
village
and
reduced
me
to
a
breakfast
of
river
water
where
the
trail
again
touched
the
stream
a
mile
beyond
three
solitary
hours
later
i
came
upon
a
miserable
little
shack
of
reeds
and
upright
poles
topped
by
thatch
on
the
ground
beside
it
a
slatternly
female
was
cooking
for
several
horsemen
two
rivers
ahead
were
reported
greatly
swollen
and
i
accepted
an
invitation
to
wait
and
accompany
a
youth
bound
for
his
employer
s
hacienda
wait
i
did
a
full
three
hours
amid
the
usual
fauna
of
an
andean
hut
while
the
travelers
took
final
leave
of
each
other
a
score
of
times
in
as
many
rounds
of
de
a
native
concoction
of
distilled
sugarcane
each
swallow
of
which
is
to
an
ordinary
mortal
not
unlike
a
sudden
blow
on
the
head
with
a
spiked
in
the
end
a
calabash
of
yuca
stew
rewarded
my
patience
the
youth
staggered
aboard
his
shaggy
horse
at
last
and
we
descended
quickly
into
a
dense
valley
with
a
broad
swift
river
i
mounted
the
horse
s
rump
to
cross
two
arms
of
the
stream
and
a
stretch
of
swamp
between
in
constant
peril
of
tobogganing
down
the
animal
s
tail
my
load
dragging
heavily
from
my
shoulders
the
moment
i
slipped
off
on
dry
land
the
youth
still
distinctly
under
the
influence
of
concentrated
demanded
a
peseta
for
his
services
long
hot
hours
we
marched
along
river
beds
in
narrow
fertile
valleys
enclosed
by
sterile
though
mountainsides
bristling
with
cactus
the
trail
panted
frequently
over
a
steep
desert
hillock
the
crupper
of
the
animal
saving
me
much
time
in
disrobing
at
a
dozen
smaller
brooks
between
which
my
companion
rode
at
my
heels
in
gloomy
silence
at
a
larger
stream
he
collected
a
and
announced
that
the
fee
for
crossing
a
river
ahead
would
be
another
as
the
effects
of
permitting
the
unbridled
drinking
of
his
health
wore
off
he
recalled
the
in
his
and
paused
to
offer
me
with
the
patronizing
air
befitting
a
horseman
toward
a
man
afoot
a
handful
of
parched
corn
and
a
rag
of
beef
gradually
he
became
less
taciturn
then
garrulous
and
gay
he
was
by
no
means
a
peon
being
assistant
mayordomo
of
the
estate
toward
which
we
were
headed
and
even
wore
shoes
yet
when
i
photographed
him
it
required
considerable
explanation
to
give
him
any
clear
conception
of
what
the
result
would
be
of
pointing
the
foolish
little
machine
at
him
y
su
aposento
donde
está
where
is
your
native
land
he
inquired
when
i
had
answered
he
rode
fully
ten
minutes
in
puzzled
silence
then
he
called
out
over
his
shoulder
y
ese
país
suyo
ese
esta
os
uni
os
es
pueblo
ó
hacienda
that
country
of
yours
is
it
a
village
or
a
plantation
the
world
as
he
knew
his
knowledge
was
on
a
par
with
that
of
thousands
of
dwellers
in
the
made
up
of
those
two
divisions
we
left
a
curving
river
labored
over
a
divide
and
descended
to
the
aranza
a
furlong
wide
roaring
angrily
at
sight
of
it
the
youth
regretted
the
bargain
he
had
made
fearing
his
horse
could
not
breast
the
swift
current
under
the
weight
of
both
of
us
and
suggested
that
i
strip
and
swim
letting
him
carry
my
clothing
and
bundle
there
seemed
to
be
no
way
to
avoid
risking
the
wealth
in
my
trousers
but
these
simple
countrymen
of
the
andes
are
commonly
more
reliable
in
matters
of
trust
than
appearances
suggest
and
a
bullet
would
avert
any
tendency
to
decamp
i
strapped
my
revolver
about
my
head
and
plunged
in
for
a
struggle
with
the
current
but
it
was
not
without
relief
that
i
landed
beside
the
exhausted
horse
and
regained
my
possessions
we
were
already
within
the
territory
of
the
hacienda
san
pablo
though
still
miles
from
the
dwelling
on
all
sides
as
far
as
the
eye
could
strain
the
river
valley
and
the
mountains
above
were
unbroken
wilderness
utterly
uninhabited
yet
the
region
was
rich
in
produce
the
that
vegetable
icecream
of
the
tropics
hung
in
from
the
trees
small
but
compact
and
juicy
wild
lemons
carpeted
the
trail
parrots
and
screaming
bands
of
parrakeets
flitted
in
and
out
of
guayaba
and
sapote
trees
here
and
there
the
dome
of
a
mango
tree
shouldered
its
way
up
through
its
punier
fellows
of
the
forest
it
was
nearing
dusk
and
i
was
near
exhaustion
under
my
load
and
the
pitiless
tropical
sun
of
seven
unbroken
hours
of
swift
rough
tramping
when
my
companion
pointed
out
far
ahead
where
the
wall
of
the
central
cordillera
shut
off
the
horizon
a
red
dot
in
the
green
immensity
hacienda
house
black
night
had
fallen
when
we
reached
the
building
and
we
stumbled
on
for
some
time
more
before
we
came
upon
the
rambling
thatched
ruin
in
which
the
owner
still
lived
he
was
eduardo
medina
once
a
law
student
in
the
university
of
san
marcos
of
lima
a
sane
earnest
man
contrasting
strangely
with
the
uncouth
countrymen
about
him
his
wife
a
handsome
limeña
was
the
first
woman
of
education
i
had
so
far
seen
in
rural
south
america
this
extraordinary
couple
noting
the
swarms
of
lawyers
that
vegetate
in
provincial
capitals
had
renounced
the
uninspiring
fleshpots
of
the
cities
and
purchasing
for
a
song
some
square
leagues
of
solitude
had
come
to
start
life
anew
in
this
wilderness
with
the
shaggy
world
piled
up
on
all
sides
and
set
their
race
a
much
needed
example
here
was
such
a
welcome
as
the
wilderness
traveler
often
dreams
but
seldom
attains
not
merely
did
they
offer
the
accommodation
andean
custom
requires
all
hacendados
to
furnish
travelers
each
according
to
his
caste
but
their
hospitality
was
genuine
and
active
the
adobe
into
which
i
was
led
for
the
astonishing
andean
purpose
of
washing
up
before
supper
had
not
only
a
real
bed
mattress
and
all
on
springs
of
split
bamboo
but
the
first
sheets
and
pillows
and
suggestion
of
civilized
comfort
i
had
seen
in
peru
it
did
not
require
the
reminder
that
the
morrow
was
sunday
and
medina
s
assertion
that
they
were
famished
for
civilized
conversation
to
make
me
accept
his
invitation
to
prolong
my
stay
my
companion
of
the
day
never
recovered
from
his
astonishment
at
seeing
the
patrón
seat
at
his
own
table
and
treat
as
an
equal
a
man
who
traveled
on
foot
and
as
often
as
i
caught
his
eye
among
the
group
that
hovered
about
the
door
all
the
evening
he
gazed
at
me
in
a
manner
that
seemed
to
implore
me
not
to
mention
the
reals
he
had
collected
under
the
impression
that
i
was
a
mere
man
and
not
a
caballero
fertile
tracts
of
valleys
and
mountains
miles
square
can
be
bought
in
this
section
of

for
yet
this
does
not
mean
that
wealth
awaits
the
purchaser
faltan

as
the
peruvian
puts
it
arms
are
lacking
the
scanty
population
has
no
stimulus
to
exertion
in
a
region
where
nature
supplies
their
simple
wants
almost
without
labor
and
to
medina
life
was
a
constant
struggle
for
employees
in
days
of
fiesta
when
money
was
needed
to
pay
the
priest
or
celebrate
a
festival
many
came
to
contract
their
services
and
accept
an
advance
but
with
no
representative
of
government
at
hand
there
was
no
means
of
forcing
them
to
do
the
work
for
which
they
had
been
prepaid
some
labored
languidly
and
intermittently
a
few
weeks
a
year
none
more
than
half
the
days
that
were
not
sacred
to
some
festival
and
general
drunkenness
on
the
hacienda
were
a
scattered
score
of
native
families
who
rent
a
patch
of
ground
on
which
to
build
a
hut
and
plant
a
bit
of
yuca
and
corn
with
the
right
to
pasture
a
few
cattle
on
the
estate
all
for
a
yearly
rental
of
which
was
commonly
as
hard
to
collect
as
labor
the
almost
total
lack
of
transportation
gave
no
market
for
any
excess
of
produce
and
here
was
the
extraordinary
case
of
a
man
and
wife
owning
what
would
be
with
us
an
entire
county
living
a
existence
very
little
above
abject
poverty
oranges
which
the
owner
asserted
he
would
be
only
too
happy
to
sell
at
five
cents
a
hundred
rotted
under
the
trees
faster
than
the
hogs
could
eat
them
mangoes
lay
where
they
fell
and
the
splendid
chirimoya
was
a
mere
worthless
wild
fruit
no
one
took
the
trouble
to
gather
except
as
personal
appetite
prompted
the
sugarcane
they
succeeded
in
raising
they
were
glad
to
get
any
price
for
after
it
had
been
squeezed
in
crude
presses
run
by
hand
and
the
boiled
down
into
blocks
of
rapadura
and
wrapped
in
banana
leaves
most
of
it
was
turned
into
aguardiente
that
could
occasionally
be
sent
to
town
my
postal
experience
in
ayavaca
recalled
to
medina
one
of
his
own
before
they
left
lima
to
take
up
their
newly
acquired
residence
the
couple
had
found
there
were
two
at
ayavaca
and
pacaipampa
about
equal
distance
from
it
days
on
muleback
it
chanced
that
señora
medina
had
ordered
her
modas
femininas
sent
to
ayavaca
while
her
husband
gave
pacaipampa
as
his
address
to
the
subscription
department
of
the
daily
el
after
the
first
few
numbers
only
one
or
two
copies
of
the
newspaper
adorned
the
weekly
of
the
hacienda
la
señora
also
noted
that
she
was
not
receiving
her
fashion
journal
regularly
the
hacendado
started
an
investigation
he
found
that
the
comely
of
ayavaca
had
recently
acquired
a
considerable
reputation
as
an
authority
on
fashions
in
pacaipampa
he
discovered
that
the
government
mail
service
was
in
the
hands
of
an
old
man
unusually
well
versed
in
the
politics
of
the
day
husband
and
wife
wrote
to
lima
ordering
el
comercio
sent
to
ayavaca
and
the
modas
femininas
by
way
of
pacaipampa
since
then
both
had
received
their
respective
journals
as
regularly
as
transportation
conditions
in
these
primitive
regions
made
reasonable
you
have
no
inconvenience
in
riding
asked
my
host
as
we
set
out
on
horseback
to
visit
the
estate
on
sunday
not
at
all
then
i
shall
furnish
you
a
mount
to
huancabamba
he
announced
i
declined
it
seemed
foolish
to
besmirch
my
long
unbroken
record
afoot
but
he
insisted
on
at
least
sending
a
peon
to
carry
my
baggage
and
to
serve
as
guide
and
actually
kept
his
promise
it
dawned
raining
as
they
say
in
the
andes
but
the
peon
assigned
the
task
because
his
rent
was
in
arrears
was
already
astride
a
good
when
i
stepped
out
into
the
storm
another
debtor
had
been
ordered
to
furnish
a
boiled
chicken
the
cook
a
bag
of
rice
with
few
respites
we
zigzagged
all
day
up
into
the
cordillera

ever
vaster
views
of
the
valleys
about
san
pablo
opening
out
though
advancing
little
except
upward
relieved
of
my
load
i
seemed
to
have
wings
and
in
the
steeper
places
had
often
to
wait
for
the
horseman
barely
a
hut
and
not
a
traveler
did
we
pass
during
a
day
which
ended
with
a
perpendicular
climb
to
a
miserable
mud
hovel
on
a
high
and
wintry
pampa
alone
accommodation
might
have
been
refused
me
but
my
companion
was
distantly
related
to
the
two
crabbed
females
who
with
their
tawny
flock
of
children
existed
in
this
cheerless
spot
and
i
was
passively
suffered
to
remain
in
their
mud
den
where
the
usual
was
blazing
under
an
ancient
and
enormous
kettle
set
on
three
stones
i
sat
down
on
a
sort
of
short
trough
with
legs
one
of
the
chairs
of
this
region
when
any
exist
and
some
time
later
we
were
served
in
bowls
made
of
gourds
a
mixture
of
potatoes
and
some
mountain
mystery
still
unsatisfied
i
drew
out
my
bag
of
rice
válgame
diós
if
that
lazy
cook
of
the
hacienda
san
pablo
had
not
delivered
it
to
me
uncooked
i
followed
the
custom
of
the
place
and
circumstances
by
presenting
the
women
with
enough
of
the
grain
to
feed
her
entire
family
for
a
day
or
two
then
asked
that
a
bowlful
be
cooked
for
me
now
hay
is
no
lard
mumbled
one
of
the
females
eureka
i
cried
then
for
once
i
can
have
it
cooked
as
it
should
there
is
no
other
kettle
said
the
woman
in
a
faint
monotone
projecting
her
lips
toward
that
containing
the
stew
illustration
the
or
of
jaen
whose
duty
it
was
at
sight
of
my
official
papers
to
find
me
lodging

make
himself
generally
useful

and
i
in
the
hungry
jungles
of
jaen
some
hours
after
the
last
glimpse
of
a
human
being
i
will
wait
until
it
is
empty
i
replied
cheerfully
with
no
other
excuse
to
offer
she
took
refuge
in
silence
an
hour
passed
before
i
broke
it
again
and
the
rice
señora
i
suggested
no
hay
manteca
she
repeated
in
the
same
dull
monotone
and
the
conversation
went
on
again
around
the
same
vicious
circle
for
more
than
an
hour
i
coaxed
and
cajoled
for
a
single
harsh
or
loud
word
to
these
unwashed
can
undo
a
day
s
careful
pleading
as
constant
dripping
of
water
in
time
wears
away
even
stone
so
my
incessant
return
to
the
subject
at
length
became
even
more
painful
than
the
stirring
from
their
customary
lethargy
the
younger
female
rose
languidly
and
took
from
the
wall
in
a
dark
corner
a
perfectly
sound
kettle
just
suited
to
the
purpose
and
after
deftly
stealing
about
half
of
it
set
to
boiling
what
i
had
kept
for
myself
the
adjoining
den
had
not
only
an
earth
floor
but
the
hillside
had
not
been
levelled
before
building
the
peon
spread
a
and
one
of
his
own
ponchos
for
me
as
solicitously
as
a
valet
preparing
his
master
s
quarters
yet
in
as
impersonal
a
manner
as
he
might
have
herded
his
sheep
into
their
corral
for
the
night
with
this
protection
and
my
own
garments
wrapped
about
my
head
i
passed
a
tolerable
night
virtually
on
the
ridge
of
the
central
range
of
the
andes
my
peon
the
two
women
several
children
two
youths
who
had
arrived
long
after
dark
at
least
six
dogs
and
a
score
of
all
slept
in
the
same
that
is
except
the
which
spent
most
of
it
squeaking
about
in
the
dark
and
now
and
then
running
over
my
prostrate
form
on
the
bleak
rolling
pampa
of
sear
yellow
dotted
by
a
few
shaggy
wild
cattle
across
which
howled
wintry
winds
i
was
not
uncomfortable
afoot
but
the
peon
from
the
tierra
caliente
of
his
native
valley
was
and
chattering
with
cold
even
with
his
head
through
several
heavy
blankets
and
a
scarf
about
his
face
i
was
passing
back
over
the
cordillera
central
for
the
first
time
since
hays
and
i
had
traversed
it
by
the
quindío
pass
not
far
below
the
arctic
summit
we
sighted
the
huancabamba
river
born
a
few
leagues
to
the
north
its
broad
spotted
with
little
green
and
gradually
dropped
into
summer
again
trees
grew
up
about
us
birds
began
once
more
to
sing
cultivated
fields
shut
in
by
cactus
hedges
bordered
the
trail
when
at
last
we
sighted
the
town
of
huancabamba
from
far
off
the
peon
halted
and
asked
to
be
allowed
to
turn
back
he
seemed
to
fancy
his
services
had
been
chiefly
those
of
guide
instead
of
i
refused
to
take
up
my
burden
again
merely
for
what
i
took
to
be
a
whim
to
be
back
lolling
in
the
shade
of
his
own
mango
tree
it
was
not
until
later
that
i
realized
that
like
most
country
youths
of
his
class
in
peru
he
dreaded
entering
the
provincial
capital
lest
he
be
held
and
forced
to
serve
in
the
army
the
swift
huancabamba
river
we
crossed
astride
the
peon
s
horse
though
not
both
at
a
time
when
i
had
dismounted
on
the
further
bank
my
companion
called
the
animal
back
by
a
peculiar
sound
half
whistle
half
cluck
and
not
long
afterward
we
clattered
into
the
famous
city
of
huancabamba
once
dismissed
the
peon
left
town
at
once
though
darkness
was
already
at
hand
medina
had
insisted
that
i
pay
him
nothing
as
he
owed
the
hacienda
more
than
two
years
nearly
four
dollars
on
the
map
huancabamba
seems
of
about
the
size
and
importance
of
philadelphia
on
the
ground
it
is
a
moribund
mud
village
in
a
hollow
between
barren
towering
mountains
historically
it
is
famous
prescott
assures
us
that
guancabamba
was
large
populous
and
many
of
its
houses
of
solid
stone
a
river
which
passed
through
the
town
had
a
bridge
over
which
ran
a
fine
inca
how
times
do
change
officially
to
be
sure
it
is
still
a
city
but
a
city
in
this
region
is
a
place
where
bread
is
made
as
those
who
wear
shoes
are
white
and
those
who
wear
bayeta
are
cholos
or
indians
picturesqueness
of
costume
there
was
none
this
having
disappeared
near
cuenca
along
with
the
quichua
tongue
indians
of
pure
race
and
distinctive
garb
had
been
rare
south
of
zaraguro
here
was
still
plenty
of
indian
blood
but
only
in
the
veins
of
civilized
mestizos
it
is
not
far
from
the
watershed
of
the
andes
the
town
of
huarmaca
just
up
on
the
ridge
of
the
cordillera
above
has
a
church
one
side
of
the
roof
of
which
sends
its
waters
to
the
pacific
and
the
other
to
the
atlantic
there
was
no
suggestion
of
hotel
the
subprefect
studied
my
papers
in
great
curiosity
with
half
the
town
looking
over
his
shoulder
before
he
answered
my
most
important
query
with
ah
it
is
impossible
on
such
short
notice
but
i
need
it
i
protested
knowing
it
was
only
a
question
of
insisting
to
overcome
the
racial
apathy
then
i
will
give
you
bed
and
sleep
on
the
floor
cried
the
subprefect
in
that
pompous
moment
with
a
large
delegation
of
huancabambinos
looking
on
no
doubt
he
would
but
such
andean
quickly
fades
away
once
the
limelight
is
switched
off
i
prefer
to
rent
a
room
of
my
own
i
persisted
ah
that
is
impossible
but
i
bowed
my
way
out
throwing
over
my
shoulder
the
information
that
i
would
go
down
to
the
bank
of
the
river
and
sleep
on
the
ground
it
would
be
softer
and
there
were
bathing
facilities
horror
spread
over
all
faces
a
man
an
estranjero
who
came
with
the
recommendations
of
great
governments
impossible
the
city
of
huancabamba
could
not
permit
it
when
word
of
it
reached
the
outside
world
soldiers
were
sent
scurrying
in
all
two
minutes
later
one
of
them
found
a
room
for
rent
in
the
home
of
one
of
the
best
families
exactly
across
the
street
from
the
subprefectura
it
can
hardly
be
that
i
was
the
first
stranger
to
enter
huancabamba
since
hernando
de
soto
was
sent
by
pizarro
to
reconnoiter
the
region
after
the
capture
of
the
inca
yet
one
might
have
fancied
so
whether
it
was
due
to
some
canine
sense
of
smell
we
of
less
favored
lands
lack
i
never
succeeded
in
getting
within
ten
yards
of
a
huancabambino
before
he
was
staring
at
me
with
bulging
eyes
and
hanging
jaw
all
work
movement
and
even
conversation
ceasing
as
i
drew
near
if
i
passed
behind
a
group
on
a
street
corner
their
necks
went
round
with
one
accord
like
those
of
owls
and
they
stared
after
me
in
unbroken
silence
as
long
as
i
remained
in
sight
men
and
women
and
outwardly
intelligent
dodged
back
into
their
house
or
shop
as
i
appeared
to
call
wife
or
children
as
they
might
for
a
passing
circus
parade
the
few
sidewalks
were
really
house
verandas
sometimes
roofed
and
on
all
ordinary
occasions
pedestrians
strolled
along
the
center
of
the
street
now
there
was
a
stranger
in
town
virtually
all
took
pains
to
cross
to
my
side
of
the
way
and
though
it
required
a
distinct
exertion
to
climb
up
to
and
down
from
this
few
yards
of
raised
sidewalk
every
inhabitant
seemed
to
find
some
excuse
every
few
minutes
to
wander
by
my
door
at
a
snail
s
pace
in
his
noiseless
bare
feet
if
i
began
any
species
of
activity
write
load
my
kodak
read
or
even
to
wash
my
hands
the
human
stream
was
clogged
like
a
against
a
snag
and
the
population
stacked
up
about
my
door
until
a
anything
broke
the
keystone
log
and
gave
me
again
for
a
moment
light
and
air
it
was
the
hospitable
huancabambino
custom
to
give
me
greeting
even
when
i
was
busy
well
inside
the
room
and
to
repeat
the
phrase
in
a
louder
and
louder
voice
until
i
acknowledged
it
those
few
who
passed
on
the
further
side
of
the
street
never
failed
to
shout
buenos
días
across
at
me
though
they
might
have
looked
in
upon
me
a
bare
two
minutes
before
now
and
then
a
more
friendly
member
of
society
wandered
complacently
into
the
room
to
peer
over
my
shoulder
or
to
handle
with
the
innocence
of
a
old
child
such
of
my
possessions
as
took
his
fancy
some
drifted
in
even
at
night
long
after
i
had
retired
for
there
being
no
other
opening
to
have
closed
the
door
would
have
been
to
smother
in
the
far
recesses
of
the
andes
the
simplest
matter
may
become
complex
my
flannel
had
at
last
succumbed
to
its
varied
hardships
now
buying
a
shirt
may
seem
too
trivial
an
experience
to
be
worthy
of
mention
in
the
wilds
of
peru
it
is
a
transaction
of
deep
importance
huancabamba
is
overstocked
with
but
what
shopkeepers
honestly
believe
a
very
heavy
shirt
would
fall
to
pieces
in
three
days
under
the
exertions
of
a
society
darling
one
garment
promising
moderate
endurance
i
did
find
but
the
combined
jangling
of
all
the
bells
of
quito
was
as
nothing
compared
to
its
color
scheme
beside
it
the
good
old
american
flag
would
have
looked
dull
and
colorless
i
set
out
to
find
a
woman
willing
to
make
a
new
shirt
on
the
pattern
of
the
old
most
of
them
did
not
wish
to
most
of
the
others
were
too
tired
two
or
three
had
less
commonplace
reasons
such
as
being
in
mourning
or
having
a
pan
to
wash
before
sunday
or
a
son
to
be
married
next
week
or
not
having
gone
to
confession
recently
toward
noon
i
caught
a
shoemaker
s
wife
unawares
and
had
her
promise
to
undertake
the
task
before
she
could
think
of
a
plausible
excuse
she
thought
a
just
price
i
to
furnish
the
cloth
would
be
twenty
cents
i
canvassed
the
shops
for
heavy
khaki
the
stoutest
on
sale
was
flimsy
as
a
s
bodice
its
color
plainly
as
evanescent
as
her
complexion
i
chose
at
last
from
a
bolt
of
cloth
designed
for
afternoon
trousers
adding
a
spool
of
the
strongest
thread
to
be
had
experience
had
long
since
taught
me
that
the
tailors
of
latin
america
use
a
thread
so
fine
that
a
deep
breath
is
almost
sure
to
burst
a
seam
or
two
i
delivered
the
materials
and
retired
for
a
belated
almuerzo
in
the
mud
hut
where
the
daily
cow
sacrificed
to
huancabamba
s
appetite
is
sold
in
nibbles
now
and
then
an
urchin
entered
clutching
a
nickel
in
one
besmeared
fist
to
say
in
the
uninflected
monotone
of
a
piece
learned
in
school
media
carne
media
vuelta
cents
worth
of
meat
cents
change
to
which
the
answer
was
almost
sure
to
be
no
hay
vuelta
there
is
no
change
whereupon
the
emissary
wandered
homeward
still
clutching
the
coin
and
the
family
evidently
passed
another
meatless
day
barely
had
i
returned
to
my
room
when
a
fever
fell
upon
me
at
the
height
of
the
attack
when
every
movement
was
a
mighty
effort
and
every
motionless
moment
an
hour
of
deep
enjoyment
an
urchin
appeared
with
the
spool
of
thread
i
had
provided
saying
it
was
heavier
than
huancabamba
was
accustomed
to
use
and
that
i
must
supply
a
spool
of
no
i
reached
for
the
brick
that
held
back
one
of
the
leaves
of
the
door
and
he
disappeared
from
my
field
of
vision
an
hour
later
he
came
back
to
report
that
the
seamstress
had
broken
a
needle
and
refused
to
risk
another
i
suspended
him
by
as
much
of
a
garment
as
he
wore
long
enough
to
promise
to
cut
off
his
ears
to
have
the
subprefect
put
the
seamstress
in
prison
and
to
bring
down
another
earthquake
upon
huancabamba
unless
the
contract
solemnly
entered
into
was
fulfilled
before
sundown
and
i
was
not
enough
to
distinguish
his
little
brown
legs
one
from
the
other
as
he
sped
back
to
the
zapatería
at
dusk
the
shirt
was
delivered
an
exact
copy
of
the
original
which
was
bequeathed
to
the
miniature
messenger
a
diet
chiefly
of
quinine
soon
had
me
ready
for
the
road
again
my
load
was
more
burdensome
than
ever
a
long
stretch
of
wilderness
ahead
required
the
carrying
of
many
pounds
of
food
and
on
down
the
valley
of
the
huancabamba
i
wobbled
like
an
octogenarian
most
of
the
day
lay
across
a
desert
of
mighty
broken
chasms
under
the
blazing
sun
scarred
gashed
and
split
with
scores
of
lines
almost
any
of
which
might
have
been
mistaken
for
the
trail
somehow
i
chanced
to
pick
the
right
one
and
brought
up
at
dusk
at
the
hut
of
alexandro
bobbío
far
up
the
chasm
of
a
small
tributary
bobbío
was
a
wiry
man
of
fifty
son
of
an
italian
though
officially
a
peruvian
speaking
only
spanish
but
and
of
infinitely
more
industry
and
initiative
than
the
natives
unlike
our
own
immigrants
those
to
south
america
retain
for
generations
a
distinct
evidence
of
their
origin
to
the
society
about
them
they
are
still
known
as
hijos
de
italiano
alemán
inglés
and
the
like
and
the
traveler
is
almost
certain
to
find
the
man
thus
designated
of
far
more
worth
than
his
neighbors
though
commonly
inferior
to
the
race
of
his
fathers
bobbío
was
a
government
employee
stationed
here
in
his
thatched
hut
to
check
the
cargoes
of
leaf
tobacco
that
salen
pa
fuera
or
pass
out
of
jaen
province
in
large
quantities
for
huancabamba
and
the
coast
in
bundles
on
horses
mules
and
cattle
like
several
of
europe
the
peruvian
government
retains
the
monopoly
of
tobacco
for
an
official
load
of
kilograms
it
pays
and
in
some
remote
districts
only
each
kilo
produces
twenty
packages
of
cigarettes
selling
for
thirty
centavos
each
in
other
words
the
kilos
bring
the
government
gold
this
system
is
directly
inherited
from
spain
and
colonial
days
stevenson
found
that
the
king
purchased
tobacco
at
three
reals
of
a
dollar
and
sold
it
at
though
much
was
spent
on
it
remained
for
republican
peru
to
open
a
truly
enormous
gulf
between
producer
and
consumer
i
wish
i
could
buy
a
burro
even
a
one
i
sighed
half
to
myself
as
i
was
straightening
up
under
my
burden
next
morning
had
he
been
an
unalloyed
bobbío
would
have
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
murmured
something
about
life
being
a
sad
matter
at
best
instead
he
cried
why
didn
t
you
say
so
and
stepping
out
into
the
sunshine
flooding
the
arid
world
like
a
shower
of
gold
waved
his
arms
in
some
local
code
of
wigwagging
at
a
hut
hung
high
up
on
the
desert
hillside
across
the
not
long
after
there
drifted
up
before
the
corredor
where
we
sat
in
the
shade
a
mestizo
youth
leading
a
small
donkey
shaggy
as
a
bear
just
emerging
from
his
winter
s
den
it
proved
to
be
a
female
of
the
species
about
sweet
sixteen
as
donkeys
go
and
due
in
the
years
to
come
to
double
in
size
moreover
she
was
in
other
words
had
never
yet
contributed
to
the
labor
of
the
world
and
appeared
to
the
youth
to
be
worth
twelve
there
ensued
the
usual
verbal
skirmish
before
we
compromised
at
ten
clipping
an
effigy
of
the
king
of
england
from
my
i
held
it
out
to
the
mestizo
he
shied
at
it
like
a
colt
at
a
flying
newspaper
the
incas
we
are
told
forbade
the
common
people
to
possess
gold
whether
it
is
due
to
that
prohibition
passed
down
by
tradition
to
the
present
day
or
to
mere
contrariness
the
countrymen
of
the
andes
still
insist
on
doing
their
transactions
in
silver
indeed
plata
is
the
most
common
word
for
money
in
all
the
region
bobbío
had
no
prejudice
against
gold
however
and
taking
ten
silver
cartwheels
from
a
hairy
cowhide
chest
in
a
far
corner
of
his
hut
he
dropped
them
into
the
youth
s
outspread
hands
and
the
latter
sped
away
up
the
hillside
to
his
hovel
leaving
me
in
possession
of
a
no
size
donkey
and
the
ancient
hawser
with
which
it
was
moored
to
a
post
of
bobbío
s
dwelling
the
first
necessity
was
a
name
for
the
animal
her
startling
beauty
against
the
background
of
the
egyptian
landscape
made
cleopatra
obvious
then
came
the
problem
of
the
furniture
without
which
no
andean
donkey
will
carry
even
a
man
s
load
bobbío
donated
an
old
over
this
went
my
poncho
thirty
centavos
seemed
a
just
price
for
a
a
donkey
saddle
of
wood
of
shape
for
another
sol
i
became
the
legal
possessor
of
a
large
and
stout
if
rather
aged
pair
of
or
cloth
in
which
my
forty
pounds
could
be
evenly
balanced
around
these
donkey
and
all
bobbío
wound
with
the
intricacy
of
long
experience
several
yards
of
rope
and
at
blazing
ten
i
was
off
at
have
my
entire
worldly
possessions
immediately
dash
away
up
the
hillside
into
a
jungle
when
they
had
been
recovered
a
nephew
of
bobbío
volunteered
to
pilot
my
new
ship
out
of
harbor
with
the
and
a
cudgel
in
hand
he
got
the
craft
under
way
then
gradually
the
cudgel
sufficed
both
as
rudder
and
throttle
a
mile
from
home
he
turned
the
command
over
to
me
and
away
we
went
alone
up
the
narrowing
valley
into
the
huazcaray
range
cleopatra
waltzing
ahead
of
me
up
the
slope
like
a
on
a
holiday
it
seemed
ridiculous
that
any
traveler
with
a
donkey
should
ever
have
had
he
expected
a
bag
filled
even
in
the
middle
to
lie
contentedly
on
the
animal
s
back
with
only
a
slight
shift
to
one
side
or
the
other
every
hour
or
two
the
alforjas
rode
like
a
cavalryman
we
zigzagged
high
over
a
range
coming
out
above
what
was
evidently
an
immense
valley
heaped
full
of
white
clouds
as
the
basket
of
a
with
cotton
and
began
to
go
swiftly
down
through
reddish
mud
ruts
deeper
than
cleopatra
was
high
then
we
picked
up
the
tamborapo
river
near
its
source
and
descended
along
a
grassy
valley
walled
by
bushy
hillsides
in
this
region
of
northern
peru
the
andes
break
down
into
great
sweltering
gorges
and
tropical
wildernesses
instead
of
the
unbroken
high
pampas
the
range
seems
to
promise
the
traveler
so
foolish
as
to
journey
through
it
catches
the
valley
of
a
river
as
it
tears
its
way
across
the
jungled
mountain
wilderness
follows
it
as
far
as
possible
then
fights
his
way
across
a
divide
to
descend
or
ascend
another
stream
neither
waterway
is
likely
to
run
in
anything
like
the
direction
he
would
go
but
by
tacking
like
a
ship
against
a
head
wind
he
advances
bit
by
bit
with
an
exertion
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
actual
progress
toward
the
nebulous
goal
he
has
set
himself
the
distance
between
two
hamlets
a
hundred
miles
apart
is
often
three
hundred
miles
in
this
labyrinthian
province
of
jaen
officially
a
province
of
peru
but
still
disputed
by
ecuador
as
the
boundary
was
between
atahuallpa
and
huascar
at
the
coming
of
the
spaniards
so
low
is
the
region
that
the
local
expression
for
entering
la
provincia
as
jaen
is
known
locally
is
va

as
might
be
designated
the
entrance
into
the
realms
of
the
unrighteous
departed
perfection
alas
is
not
of
this
world
now
that
i
might
have
added
a
plentiful
supply
of
foodstuffs
to
my
pack

increasing

cleopatra

section
of
the

food
is
under
no
circumstances
for

furthermore
with
a
thousand
miles
of
road
just
suited
to
donkeys
behind
me
it
must
be
my
fortune
the
morning
after
at
last
acquiring
one
to
strike
the
worst
possible
road
for
them
strictly
speaking
there
was
no
road
but
for
certain
spaces
trees
enough
had
been
felled
to
make
passage
through
the
forest
possible
and
the
rainy
season
and
had
combined
to
turn
these
clearings
into
unbroken
miles
of
those
ridges
of
hard
earth
with
a
coating
of
slippery
mud
alternating
with
ditches
of
liquid
mud
from
two
to
three
feet
deep
a
pedestrian
even
with
forty
pounds
on
his
back
may
trip
along
the
tops
of
these
as
blithely
as
a
youthful
opera
company
counting
the
ties
from
red
cloud
to
chicago
but
to
attempt
to
drive
a
jackass
laden
with
all
the
driver
s
earthly
possessions
in
far
from
waterproof
cloth
sacks
through
mile
after
monotonous
mile
of
them
under
an
endless
tropical
downpour
is
an
experience
to
stir
the
most
blazé
and
soul
those
steps
at
which
the
uncomplaining
little
brute
did
not
slip
off
into
the
ditch
behind
the
ridge
on
which
she
had
set
her
feet
were
those
in
which
she
fell
with
a
still
more
splash
into
the
ditch
ahead
usually
each
pair
of
feet
was
divided
in
its
allegiance
and
reduced
the
animal
to
that
artistic
performance
popularly
known
in
circles
as
splitting
the
more
times
than
i
could
have
counted
cleopatra

me
with
mud
from
the
crown

my
hat
to
my
inundated
boots
soaking
my
possessions
in
seas
of
mud
now
and
then
frankly
lying
down
in
despair
as
often
attempting
to
shirk
her
just
portion
of
this
world

troubles
by
dashing
into
the
impenetrable
dripping
jungle
and
smashing
my
maltreated
belongings
against
the
trees
from
time
to
time
she
became
hopelessly
entangled
with
a
train
of
going
outside
forcing
me
to
wade
in
and
lift
her
bodily
pack
and
all
out
of
some
slough
above
which
little
more
than
her
drooping
ears
were
visible
in
short
when
this
royal
highway
waded
across
the
barnyard

the
hacienda

sell
anything

the
rapadura
and
they
look
upon
as
their
legitimate
source

income
yet
they
are
too
miserly
to
give
much
the
best
i
could
do
was
to
accept
with

of
deep
gratitude
two
small
cotton
sackfuls
of
and
the
former
slices
of
plantains
warranted
to
keep
forever

taste

oak

any
appetite
the
latter
hard
squares
of
fried
fat
pork
of
the
size
of
small

then
of
course
there
was
the
inevitable
slab
of
crude
sugar
wrapped
in
banana
leaves
the
road
was
worse
than
that
of
the
day
before
times
without
number
i
concluded
the
end
of
the
journey
had
come
for
one
of
us
yet
somehow
the
maltreated
little
brute
sprawled
forward
through
the
pouring
rain
dense
dripping
unbroken
forests
abounding
with
the
red
berries
of
wild
coffee
crowded
close
on
either
hand
below
the
swollen
tamborapo
roared
incessantly
close
alongside
adding
to
the
constant
fear
of
losing
all
my
possessions
the
continual
dread
of
reaching
some
impassable
stream
toward
the
end
of
a
day
during
which
we
had
forded
a
dozen
difficult
tributaries
we
were
halted
by
a
raging
branch
plainly
foolhardy
to
attempt
i
chased
cleopatra
up
through
the
jungle
alongside
it
until
darkness
came
on
and
forced
us
to
camp
in
a
tiny
open
space
my
perishable
possessions
hung
in
the
trees
against
destruction
by
ants
and
the
donkey
tied
to
the
trunk
that
formed
my
all
night
long
the
animal
walked
round
and
round
over
me
though
without
once
stepping
on
my
prostrate
form
or
the
baggage
in
the
morning
we
tore
our
way
far
on
up
the
tributary
before
we
came
in
sight
of
a
bridge
that
is
two
poles
tied
with
vines
to
a
tree
on
either
bank
i
had
piled
my
garments
on
top
of
the
load
and
was
just
dragging
my
reluctant
into
the
stream
when
a
youth
appeared
on
the
opposite
bank
making
wild
signs
to
me
across
the
uproar
of
waters
by
the
time
i
had
regained
the
shore
he
arrived
in
abbreviated
shirt
by
way
of
the
bridge
carrying
a
stout
staff
and
a
rope
with
these
he
dragged
the
donkey
stripped
stark
naked
into
the
stream
and
fervently
crossing
himself
twice
fought
his
way
with
it
into
the
torrent
while
i
made
three
trips
along
the
poles
with
the
baggage
that
would
infallibly
have
been
washed
away
but
for
this
experienced
his
particular
saint
did
not
fail
him
and
having
delivered
the
drenched
and
disgusted
animal
to
me
on
the
further
bank
he
accepted
a
with
a
gratitude
that
suggested
he
considered
himself
for
risking
his
life
slowly
monotonously
day
after
day
we
pushed
on
through
the
amazonian
not
only
in
appearance
but
because
the
tamborapo
soon
to
join
the
marañón
forms
a
part
of
the
great
network
of
the
father
of
waters
the
unpeopled
forest
draped
with
vines
that
here
and
there
like
broken
cables
dipped
their
ends
in
the
stream
seemed
to
have
no
end
the
absolute
solitude
of
the
region
ever
shut
in
by
impenetrable
jungle
with
never
a
view
of
the
horizon
with
no
sign
of
the
existence
of
humanity
and
no
other
sounds
than
the
occasional
scream
of
a
bird
and
the
constant
roar
of
the
stream
had
a
peculiar
effect
on
the
moods
one
felt
abandoned
by
the
world
and
came
to
look
upon
all
nature
as
a
cruel
determined
that
his
prisoner
should
never
again
be
permitted
to
pick
up
the
threads
of
his
existence
nor
even
communicate
with
the
world
that
had
abandoned
him
the
very
silence
added
to
the
gloom
until
i
felt
like
screaming
well
speak
burro
it
was
a
relief
not
to
sweat
under
my
own
load
but
it
was
distinctly
more
laborious
to
drive
it
before
me
day
after
day
i
beat
up
cleopatra
s
rear
from
dawn
to
dusk
without
a
pause
yet
covered
scarcely
half
the
distance
i
might
have
plodded
alone
even
where
the
trail
was
level
and
dry
the
docile
yet
headstrong
brute
could
not
exceed
two
miles
an
hour
wherever
a
bit
of
slope
or
stones
and
mud
intervened
she
picked
her
way
with
the
cautious
deliberation
of
an
old
lady
entering
a
insects
swarmed
my
unshaven
face
and
all
the
expanse
of
skin
from
crown
to
toes
were
blotched
and
swollen
with
their
visitations
the
chifles
and
charol
gave
out
and
left
only
the
rapadura
and
as
hunger
antidotes
on
the
third
day
even
the
last
chunk
of
crude
sugar
disappeared
and
still
the
two
of
us
plodded
on
equally
gaunt
and
lacking
in
ambition
and
energy
i
had
lived
on
for
more
than
hours
and
lost
my
way
several
times
on
forking
trails
that
climbed
to
nowhere
far
above
or
were
swallowed
up
in
the
jungle
when
i
guessed
again
at
a
path
that
climbed
up
out
of
the
valley
of
the
river
by
and
by
it
sweated
up
to
a
hut
of
poles
where
lived
a
in
charge
of
the
stock
of
a
vast
hacienda
of
the
wilderness
only
a
little
girl
of
eight
was
at
home
and
she
did
not
know
that
roads
were
meant
to
lead
anywhere
tying
cleopatra
in
the
shade
of
the
eaves
i
sat
down
to
await
adult
information
starvation
seemed
to
have
danced
its
orgy
for
weeks
before
my
weary
eyes
when
the
child
came
out
with
a
fat
ripe
chirimoya
to
lisp
in
a
shaky
voice
le
gu
ta
e
ta

hours
later
a
gaunt
man
appeared
and
at
sight
of
me
shouted
the
stereotyped
greeting
of
all
his
class
to
any
visitor
ahorse
or
afoot
when
i
declined
with
the
customary
formalities
he
opened
preliminary
inquiries
as
to
my
biography
i
broke
in
upon
them
to
suggest
food
entra

descansa
señor
he
replied
the
rural
peruvian
would
invite
one
to
enter
and
take
a
a
block
of
he
came
to
put
out
a
fire
he
produced
a
glass
made
from
a
broken
bottle
and
insisted
on
my
partaking
of
his
hospitality
to
the
extent
of
drinking
his
health
in
the
aguardiente
into
which
he
turned
his
in
a
little
thatched
distillery
down
in
a
hollow
nearby
but
my
every
hint
of
a
desire
to
buy
food
was
diplomatically
ignored
except
that
he
accepted
readily
enough
a
real
and
sent
the
child
upstairs
that
is
to
crawl
up
to
and
along
the
reed
ceiling
to
fetch
me
a
chunk
of
rapadura
the
invisible
trail
he
pointed
out
pitched
down
a
and
almost
perpendicular
of
loose
stones
to
another
stream
then
struggled
breathlessly
upward
through
unbroken
forest
over
the
guaranguia
range
a
jungled
mountain
spur
from
the
crest
of
which
there
spread
out
before
me
the
vast
panorama
of
an
the
tamborapo
far
below
squirming
away
through
its
steep
valley
and
all
about
it
hills
of
varying
colors
that
gave
the
landscape
the
appearance
of
a
tempestuous
sea
turned
to
jungle
earth
red
cliffs
like
our
western
flashed
their
faces
in
the
sunset
and
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
in
any
direction
was
no
sign
that
man
had
ever
before
entered
this
trackless
wilderness
it
was
nearing
dusk
when
the
world
fell
away
before
us
into
a
great
wooded
quebrada
its
bottom
unfathomable
but
with
a
trail
in
plain
sight
fighting
its
way
up
the
opposite
slope
the
path
underfoot
melted
away
and
where
cleopatra
led
i
followed
certain
she
knew
the
way
as
well
as
i
the
ghost
of
a
trail
she
had
chosen
turned
to
a
perpendicular
down
which
the
animal
sprawled
and
stumbled
bumping
her
load
against
the
trees
but
unable
to
fall
far
through
the
dripping
forest
that
grew
up
impenetrably
about
us
dense
black
night
found
us
at
the
bottom
of
a
valley
i
sought
the
corresponding
path
on
the
opposite
side
of
its
small
stream
by
feeling
with
both
feet
and
hands
but
it
was
as
intangible
as
the
straight
and
narrow
path
of
theological
phraseology
to
cheer
things
on
it
began
to
rain
in
deluges
i
made
the
most
of
a
genuinely
peruvian
situation
by
halting
for
the
night
where
there
was
at
least
drinkingwater
so
sharp
was
the
valley
that
there
was
not
even
a
flat
space
large
enough
to
stretch
out
and
i
could
only
curl
up
in
the
muddy
path
that
had
brought
us
to
this
sad
pass
tumbling
my
soaked
baggage
somewhere
beside
me
and
tying
the
exhausted
animal
to
something
in
the
dark
where
there
was
neither
a
leaf
to
eat
nor
a
spot
for
the
brute
to
lie
down
in
by
morning
light
i
found
that
cleopatra
s
inexperience
and
asinine
judgment
had
led
us
to
a
place
where
wild
cattle
came
to
drink
and
we
were
forced
to
struggle
back
to
the
crest
of
the
hill
and
descend
again
by
another
trail
that
linked
up
with
the
one
we
had
seen
the
afternoon
before
at
its
foot
was
a
field
of
in
which
the
starving
animal
spent
the
rest
of
the
morning
in
regaining
strength
for
the
climb
ahead
above
a
new
style
of
landscape
spread
out
before
us
a
vast
bushy
plain
was
passable
only
by
following
the
windings
of
a
sandy
and
stony
and
wading
with
monotonous
frequency
the
stream
that
swung
back
and
forth
across
it
like
a
person
utterly
devoid
of
a
sense
of
direction
or
power
of
decision
beyond
we
tramped
monotonously
on
through
endless
chaparral
bushy
woods
where
reigned
an
utter
solitude
only
enhanced
by
the
mournful
cry
of
some
unseen
bird
the
most
constantly
recurring
form
of
vegetation
was
the
a
sort
of
cottonwood
tree
with
a
trunk
swollen
as
a
gormand
s
endlessly
this
dismal
wilderness
stretched
onward
from
dawn
to
dark
until
the
traveler
could
fancy
himself
in
solitary
confinement
for
life
and
in
danger
of
losing
the
mind
for
which
he
could
find
no
employment
the
region
would
have
been
more
endurable
had
i
been
able
to
stride
forward
at
my
own
pace
but
cleopatra
sentenced
me
to
a
monotonous
unchanging
snail
s
gait
that
gave
sufficient
exercise
only
to
my
right
arm
and
the
cudgel
it
bore
hundreds
of
red
centipedes
littered
the
ground
the
dead
dry
silence
was
broken
only
by
the
rhythmic
mournful
cry
of
a
jungle
bird
but
here
the
going
was
smooth
and
for
long
distances
our
pace
was
so
unbroken
that
there
ran
through
my
unoccupied
mind
for
hours
at
a
time
the
paraphrase
of
an
old
refrain
two
jacks
with
but
a
single
gait
six
feet
that
walk
as
next
to
the
the
tree
that
most
often
repeated
itself
was
the
producing
a
fruit
like
large
brown
filled
with
black
seeds
the
white
pulp
of
which
had
qualities
and
a
taste
mildly
resembling
the
watermelon
i
had
lost
account
of
days
entirely
but
subsequent
checking
up
proved
it
was
a
sunday
afternoon
when
i
halted
at
the
hacienda
shumba
and
spreading
out
my
mouldy
garments
on
the
thatch
roof
of
its
only
hut
awaited
the
owner
he
proved
to
be
the
teniente
gobernador
the
of
the
region
in
the
remnants
of
two
garments
and
a
hat
having
turned
cleopatra
into
a
pasture
he
settled
down
to
spell
out
the
documents
i
presented
strictly
speaking
he
was
not
the
hacienda
owner
but
only
an
though
i
had
not
suspected
it
i
had
been
traveling
for
days
through
estates
which
as
or
belong
to
the
bishopric
of
trujillo
and
it
is
partly
the
heavy
hand
of
the
church
that
keeps
this
region
so
solitary
and
uninhabited
the
owners
are
really
agents
who
administer
them
for
the
tonsured
landlords
collecting
a
rental
from
the
few
families
who
raise
a
bit
of
rice
cacao
and
cattle
the
region
is
far
less
rich
than
it
is
locally
reputed
the
soil
of
the
is
fertile
but
the
mountains
are
rocky
and
often
arid
and
especially
in
this
section
poorly
served
by
the
rains
a
government
official
himself
my
host
complained
bitterly
against
the
government
tax
on
tobacco
liquor
sugar
salt
and
matches
the
first
he
asserted
was
no
longer
worth
planting
all
were
gringos
to
the
teniente
gobernador
a
of
mine
he
asserted
had
spent
a
night
with
him
two
years
before
he
s
italian
no
a
german
though
he
could
read
and
write
laboriously
and
had
long
been
a
government
compulsion
and
without
world
as
he
conceived
it
consisted
of
peru
and
another
very
much
smaller
country
with
several
towns
of
more
or
less
the
same
size
and
conditions
as
the
two
villages
of
jaen
and
tocabamba
he
had
seen
named
germany
italy
estados
unidos
and
so
on
from
which
came
the
various
types
of
indeed
he
wished
to
know
is
germany
in
the
same
country
as
the
united
states
what
do
you
call
a
native
of
jaen
i
chanced
to
ask
him
in
the
course
of
our
conversation
a
jaense
to
be
sure
he
replied
just
as
you
call
a
native
of
italy
an
italiano
or
a
man
from
the
town
named
france
a
but
if
his
knowledge
was
slight
it
was
no
less
tenacious
and
he
could
no
more
be
talked
out
of
his
geographical
conceptions
than
out
of
his
conviction
that
all
the
world
lives
in
huts
with
earth
floors
goes
habitually
barefoot
and
considers
its
dwellings
fit
for
when
i
asked
him
if
the
road
beyond
jaen
was
good
i
was
startled
to
hear
the
assurance
ah
yes
indeed
there
are
no
bad
roads
in
peru
a
divan
of
reeds
set
into
the
mud
wall
of
the
single
room
and
covered
with
a
hairy
cowhide
was
quite
soft
enough
as
a
bed
for
one
who
had
long
since
left
effeminate
civilization
behind
until
long
after
dark
we
two
men
and
a
woman
squatted
in
chairs
fitting
to
a
doll
s
house
and
fed
ourselves
over
our
knees
yet
the
conventions
of
society
are
quite
as
fixed
in
these
hovels
of
the
wilderness
as
in
any
palace
of
aristocracy
it
was
quite
à
la
mode
a
sign
of
good
breeding
in
fact
to
ask
for
a
second
helping
of
the
bean
and
yuca
is
invariably
served
so
boiling
hot
that
even
the
experienced
gringo
s
teeth
under
no
circumstances
for
a
third
when
they
had
been
emptied
a
second
time
the
gourd
bowls
were
piled
up
on
the
floor
in
a
corner
to
be
washed
when
the
spirit
moved
and
as
if
at
a
signal
that
there
was
no
second
course
the
one
glass
in
the
house
tied
together
with
a
string
and
evidently
regarded
as
a
great
treasure
and
heirloom
was
filled
with
and
passed
around
the
circle
beginning
with
the
guest
the
feeble
imitation
of
a
candle
soon
flickered
out
and
by
eight
we
were
all
scattered
along
the
walls
of
the
hut
on
our
reed
divans
quarreling
pigs
shaking
the
house
as
they
jostled
against
it
and
the
rain
that
fell
heavily
all
night
long
dripping
upon
us
here
and
there
through
the
thatched
roof
cleopatra
was
so
nearly
bushed
morning
that
even
under
her
slight
load
she
wabbled
drunkenly
and
kept
her
footing
chiefly
because
the
heavy
mud
clung
to
our
feet
like
pedestals
to
a
statue
for
one
considerable
space
the
way
led
through
a
swamp
where
i
was
several
times
forced
to
wade
to
carry
out
the
load
and
lift
the
bemired
animal
to
her
feet
yet
drinkable
water
was
not
to
be
had
and
the
choking
tropical
humidity
was
the
more
tantalizing
as
rain
broke
every
few
minutes
and
everything
in
sight
was
dripping
wet
though
the
sandy
soil
swallowed
each
shower
as
it
fell
toward
noon
the
now
considerable
trail
split
marking
an
important
parting
of
the
way
for
the
branch
to
the
left
leads
quickly
down
to
bellavista
on
the
bank
of
the
marañón
whence
rafts
descend
to
iquitos
and
the
rubber
country
and
so
by
the
amazon
to
the
atlantic
while
i
bearing
to
the
right
plodded
on
along
the
highlands
of
the
andes
in
the
woods
a
few
decrepit
and
huts
grew
up
several
drowsy
beings
in
human
form
gazing
languidly
after
me
from
the
doorways
and
before
i
knew
it
i
was
treading
the
streets
of
the
provincial
capital
and
city
of

chapter
x
approaching

small
wonder
that
the
traveler
who
has
splashed
and
waded
a
long
week
through
the
mournful
wilderness
living
chiefly
on
fond
hopes
salted
with
the
anticipations
of
an
unschooled
imagination
and
washed
down
with
river

should
fetch
up
in
jaen
with
a
decided
shock
occupying
a
large
and
distinct
place
on
the
map
this
provincial
capital
proved
to
be
a
disordered
cluster
of
a
wretched
thatched
huts
the
roofs
full
of
holes
the
gables
often
missing
scattered
like
abandoned
junk
among
the
weeds
and
bushes
of
a
clearing
in
the
selfsame
gloomy
forest
and
spiny
jungle
that
had
so
long
shut
me
in
the
barefoot
inhabitants
of
mongrel
breed
stared
curiously
from
their
mud
doorways
as
i
stalked
past
smeared
with
dried
mud
from
head
to
foot
sunburned
shaggy
with
whiskers
and
dragging
behind
me
by
main
force
an
emaciated
donkey
trembling
with
excitement
at
the
unwonted
sights
or
with
fear
at
the
unknown
dangers
of
so
vast
a
metropolis
from
one
hut

no

from
its
neighbors

the
city

the
teacher
with
a
ragged
cap
on
his
head
and
a
drooping
cigarette
smouldering
between
his
lips
to
stare
after
me
with
the
rest
every
building
in
town
the
church
included
consisted
of
a
single
mud
room
with
an
unleveled
earth
floor
windowless
and
with
a
small
reed
or
pole

giving
entrance

and
such
air
and
light
as
could
force

the

which
i
tied
cleopatra
to
the
official
bamboo
flagpole
in
the
geographical
center
of
the
capital
was
closed
with
a
flourish
of
my
papers
i
summoned
the
authorities
to
step
forward
and
make
themselves
known
but
the
manoeuver
brought
only
the
information
that
the
subprefect
was
away
for
a
few
days
but
he
ll
soon
be
back
next
week
no
más
or
the
week
after
at
any
rate
entra

the
gobernador
was
likewise
among
the
indefinitely
missing
whence
the
mantle
of
power
descended
upon
the
shoulders
of
the
alcalde
that
worthy
was
soon
produced
somewhat
the
worse
for
concentrated
but
remarkable
for
at
least
two
features
he
wore
what
might
still
with
some
stretch
of
veracity
be
called
shoes
and
alone
of
all
the
town
could
have
passed
for
a
white
man
had
he
seen
fit
to
remove
a
stringy
little
indian
mustache
when
he
had
read
aloud
to
the
congregated
male
population
all
my
credentials
in
task
not
unlike
that
of
a
man
walking
without
his
crutches
after
spraining
his
ankle
and
suffering
a
requested
me
to
name
my
desires
they
were
modest
bed
table
chair
water
food
for
myself
and
pasture
for
the
other
one
of
us
until
day
after
slowly
and
bit
by
bit
but
none
the
less
surely
my
requirements
were
met
a
key
was
found
that
manipulated
the
creaking
padlock
of
one
of
the
thatched
with
sagging
reed
divans
around
its
walls
a
crippled
table
was
dragged
in
and
a
squad
of
soldiers
sent
for
old
newspapers
to
cover
it
in
due
time
and
with
the
assistance
of
the
entire
population
in
a
house
to
house
canvass
a
gourd
was
discovered
then
a
gourd
with
a
hole
in
one
end
from
which
one
drank
and
into
which
the
boy
thrust
a
finger
to
carry
it
after
filling
it
at
the
stream
at
the
edge
of
the
town
a
chair
was
unofficially
subtracted
from
the
government
palace
and
last
of
all
a
mirror
was
pinned
to
the
mud
wall
i
had
barely
removed
the
hirsute
adornment
of
a
week
by
such
light
as
jaen
massed
in
and
about
the
door
left
me
when
a
barefoot
female
glided
noiselessly
into
my
den
and
announcing
herself
the
owner
carried
off
the
glass
as
too
precious
a
possession
to
be
long
out
of
her
sight
the
first
stroll
disclosed
the
hitherto
unsuspected
fact
that
several
of
the
were
shops
one
of
them
posed
as
a
restaurant
but
its
restorative
powers
were
at
best
anemic
jaen
is
probably
the
hottest
and
certainly
the
hungriest
provincial
capital
in
peru
to
retain
its
rank
as
a
city
it
fulfilled
nominally
the
test
as
a
place
where
bread
is
made
tiny
soggy
bun
selling
for
the
price
of
an
american
loaf
milk
and
fruit
which
might
easily
have
been
superabundant
here
were
unknown
luxuries
and
the
customary
food
of
the
populace
included
nothing
a
dog
would
have
touched
in
any
but
a
ravenous
state
a
dozen
of
us
without
families
including
the
alcalde
were
dependent
upon
the
restaurant
and
we
agreed
upon
a
fixed
ration
of
bread
and
eggs
the
supply
of
which
never
approached
even
the
normal
demand
but
the
alcalde
quickly
formed
the
habit
of
sneaking
over
before
the
hour
set
and
by
virtue
of
his
official
powers
consuming
most
of
the
provender
to
forestall
him
the
rest
of
us
took
to
arriving
earlier
until
it
grew
customary
to
appear
for
the
noonday
meal
at
about
nine
and
to
sit
down
to
supper
toward
three
eyeing
each
other
ravenously
and
jealously
watching
the
cook
s
every
movement
he
who
is
accustomed
to
complain
of
the
high
cost
of
living
should
try
the
antidote
of
a
journey
down
the
andes
where
the
high
cost
reigns
supreme
without
the
living
in
these
languid
corners
of
the
world
where
life
is
reduced
to
its
lowest
terms
food
and
lodging
assume
the
first
place
of
importance
and
the
mind
is
never
free
from
these
primitive
apprehensions
no
sooner
does
one
eat
than
the
worry
arises
as
to
where
the
next
meal
will
come
from
as
each
day
s
pleasure
on
the
road
is
tempered
by
wondering
what
hardship
the
night
will
have
in
store
there
were
some
evidences
of
negro
blood
in
jaen
though
that
of
the
aboriginal
indian
tribe
of
the
region
was
universal
in
the
percentage
of
one
half
to
a
far
smaller
fraction
in
varying
individuals
the
men
wore
garments
of
the
cheapest
cotton
patched
and
generally
no
shirt
with
merely
a
kerchief
knotted
about
the
neck
above
the
undershirt
and
de
hats
woven
of
a
species
of
or
reeds
which
a
few
weeks
of
sun
and
rain
gave
the
appearance
of
a
badly
thatched
roof
the
women
wore
no
hats
combed
their
hair
flat
and
smooth
without
adornments
and
let
it
hang
down
their
backs
in
a
single
braid
like
all
the
cholas
and
of
the
sex
in
the
andes
they
dragged
their
misshapen
skirts
constantly
in
the
mire
of
the
streets
and
the
floors
of
their
huts
and
were
habitually
even
less
cleanly
in
their
habits
than
the
men
the
stage
of
education
may
be
gaged
from
the
fact
that
the
government
telegraph
operator
assured
me
i
could
not
reach
cerro
de
pasco
by
land
but
must
cross
the
sea
to
lima
and
take
the
railroad
from
there
jaen
s
chief
pastime
for
speeding
up
the
monotonous
stretch
between
the
cradle
and
the
grave
is
the
consumption
of
the
native
cañazo
and
only
those
who
rose
early
were
likely
to
find
a
completely
sober
man
a
sort
of
harmless
anarchy
reigned
a
man
merry
with
might
sit
outside
the
mud
and
keep
school
from
functioning
all
day
long
without
interference
an
amorous
youth
going
on
a
drunken
rampage
among
the
huts
or
the
washerwomen
on
the
banks
of
the
irrigating
ditch
was
avoided
if
possible
but
was
never
forcibly
restrained
as
is
frequent
in
tropical
towns
there
was
little
evidence
of
religion
pseudo
or
otherwise
which
thrives
best
in
the
high
cold
regions
of
the
mysterious
páramos
the
mud
church
with
its
tower
melted
off
unevenly
at
the
top
like
a
candle
in
a
wind
had
long
since
lost
its
cura
and
served
now
as
provincial
jail
by
the
simple
addition
of
a
few
poles
set
in
adobe
across
the
door
and
a
few
languid
soldiers
lolling
in
the
general
vicinity
whenever
they
had
no
particular
desire
to
be
somewhere
else
on
the
afternoon
of
my
arrival
the
rumor
floated
languidly
over
the
town
that
the
weekly
cow
was
to
be
butchered
next
morning
but
it
was
denied
later
in
the
evening
i
made
the
most
of
my
day
of
leisure
by
acquiring
a
bar
of
native
soap
of
the
appearance
of
a
and
the
scent
of
boiling
glue
and
spending
some
two
hours
in
the
irrigating
ditch
stringing
across
the
main
street
from
a
telegraph
pole
to
a
rafter
of
my
house
all
the
garments
that
could
be
spared
from
use
in
an
unexacting
society
nothing
was
more
certain
than
that
i
should
start
again
at
daylight
of
the
second
news
arrived
that
the
river
eighteen
miles
south
was
impassable
until
the
waters
receded
it
was
evident
too
that
i
must
deny
myself
the
companionship
of
she
hung
wilted
and
dejected
in
the
town
pasture
and
at
best
there
was
no
hope
that
she
would
last
many
days
further
even
if
there
were
any
means
of
getting
her
across
the
swollen
river
i
accepted
the
alcalde
s
offer
of
for
the
animal
and
her
furniture
and
felt
a
glow
of
satisfaction
tempered
with
regret
at
the
loss
of
a
good
companion
for
all
her
faults
that
i
should
no
longer
have
to
drag
my
feet
behind
me
at
her
snail
s
pace
and
be
dependent
on
my
right
arm
for
advancement
on
the
morning
i
should
have
started
the
rumor
again
ran
riot
that
the
town
was
going
to
un
peel
a
this
time
matters
went
so
far
as
to
lead
the
octogenarian
victim
out
into
the
main
street
where
the
population
gathered
in
an
attitude
of
anticipation
a
dozen
or
more
armed
with
axes
and
knives
the
rest
with
pots
and
gourds
for
a
long
time
the
languid
hubbub
of
some
discussion
rose
and
fell
about
the
downcast
animal
then
gradually
the
gathering
disintegrated
and
scattered
to
its
huts
each
pausing
at
sight
of
a
face
to
drone
in
that
singularly
indifferent
monotone
of
the
tropics
no

agent
of
a
neighboring
hacienda
it
turned
out
had
offered
for
the
animal
and
jaen
did
not
feel
justified
in
squandering
any
such
fortune
for
mere
food
my
rosy
dream
of
again
tasting
fresh
meat
and
of
carrying
supplies
on
my
journey
was
once
more
rudely
dissipated
the
east
was
blushing
from
the
first
kiss
of
the
bold
tropical
sun
when
i
sallied
forth
on
the
morning
i
had
concluded
to
start
river
or
no
river
and
went
to
wake
up
the
restaurant
keeper
sleeping
on
his
with
the
precious
under
his
head
the
alcalde
appeared
almost
at
the
same
instant
from
the
direction
of
the
irrigation
ditch
his
towel
about
his
neck
he
greeted
me
with
forced
courtesy
his
solemn
promise
to
arrange
to
have
my
baggage
transported
to
the
river
in
consideration
for
the
low
price
at
which
he
had
acquired
cleopatra
had
gone
the
way
of
most
south
american
thin
air
now
i
reminded
him
of
it
he
would
order
a
soldier
to
accompany
me
at
once
the
earth
swung
a
long
way
eastward
on
its
axis
without
any
other
sign
of
activity
then
some
one
came
to
say
that
a
soldier
would
not
be
sent
because
anastasio
centurión
returning
to
his
hacienda
algarrobo
forthwith
would
be
delighted
to
carry
my
belongings
on
his
mule
an
hour
later
he
declined
to
carry
them
then
he
was
prevailed
upon
by
his
the
to
renew
his
offer
then
he
again
concluded
the
weight
was
too
great
and
finally
sent
an
urchin
for
my
before
they
were
loaded
however
a
dispute
broke
out
over
the
ownership
of
a
silver
spur
that
had
been
picked
up
in
the
sand
of
the
main
street
and
the
town
followed
the
alcalde
to
the
mud
hut
that
served
as
court
of
justice
it
was
also
the
city
bakery
and
the
wife
of
the
justice
who
had
put
off
baking
the
morning
before
and
was
not
yet
mixing
the
dough
ceded
a
corner
of
the
kitchen
table
to
the
court
which
in
the
course
of
an
hour
settled
the
case
in
the
customary
deciding
that
the
disputed
property
should
remain
in
the
hands
of
illustration
a
woman
of
the
jungles
of
jaen
preparing
me
the
first
meal
in
days
at
the
typical
ecuadorian
she
declined
to
pose
for
her

a
soldier
was
at
length
sent
to
round
up
one
of
the
donkeys
grazing
in
the
main
plaza
gradually
the
disgusted
animal
was
fitted
with
my
former
amid
the
contrary
suggestions
of
the
populace
and
the
alcalde
furnished
me
an
order
to
the
ferrymen
at
the
river
to
set
me
across
in
the
name
of
the
to
return
donkey
and
a
winding
narrow
stony
path
that
wet

feet
at

very
outset
squirmed
away
through

how
it
could
give
more
turns
than
the
one
we
were
following
it
was
hard
to
imagine
my
this
time
was
a
matron
of
forty
comparatively
speaking
and
correspondingly
set
in
her
ways
within
the
first
mile
se
me
escapó
as
the
natives
have
it
that
is
she
suddenly
bolted
into
the
thorny
wilderness
at
the
first
suggestion
of
an
opening
and
left
me
dripping
with
sweat
and
speckled
with
the
blood
of
a
dozen
superficial
lacerations
before
i
again
laid
hands
on
her
in
an
impassable
clump
of
brambles
and
cactus
anastasio
tied
her
to
his
saddle
and
for
an
hour
or
so
she
seemed
completely
resigned
to
her
fate
but
evidently
there
is
no
trusting
the
sex
at
that
age
no
sooner
was
she
paroled
than
she
bolted
again
and
led
me
a
chase
of
several
miles
through
a
wild
and
waterless
solitude
yet
after
all
manipulating
a
donkey
is
a
splendid
apprenticeship
for
dealing
with
no
better
training
could
be
suggested
for
the
prospective
salesman
south
of
the
rio
grande
the
going
ranged
from
to
now
along
the
stony
bed
of
a
meandering
river
yesterday
all
but
impassable
so
bone
dry
there
was
only
a
bit
of
running
mud
to
quench
the
thirst
now
over
a
sharp
knoll
bristling
with
jagged
loose
stones
at
noon
we
reached
the
huancabamba
river
now
grown
to
man
s
estate
where
it
swings
around
to
join
the
marañón
and
divides
the
province
of
jaen
from
that
of
cutervo
a
laborious
two
hours
up
it
brought
us
to
the
puerto
sauce
where
the
government
maintains
a
ferry
small
logs
bound
together
with
vines
and
manned
by
three
housed
in
two
here
we
squatted
out
the
day
watching
the
stream
race
by
on
its
long
journey
to
the
atlantic
with
all
the
impetuosity
of
the
rainy
season
the
government
had
been
sitting
here
nearly
a
week
his
stacked
and
his
horse
tethered
close
at
hand
only
out
on
the
extreme
edge
of
the
bank
where
an
occasional
breath
of
tepid
breeze
tempered
the
heat
and
thinned
the
swarms
of
stinging
insects
was
life
endurable
my
skin
was
a
patchwork
of
mementoes
of
all
the
minute
fauna
of
the
past
week
and
an
itching
like
the
constant
prick
of
myriad
needles
was
relieved
only
briefly
by
each
dip
in
the
stream
during
one
of
them
i
advanced
well
into
the
river
and
it
seemed
i
could
have
crossed
it
that
even
the
peruvians
might
have
made
the
passage
had
they
male
blood
in
their
veins
but
then
had
they
been
men
they
would
long
since
have
built
a
bridge
all
through
the
night
there
kept
running
through
my
head
amid
the
sweep
of
the
waters
that
illuminating
remark
of
kim
a
sahib
is
always
tied
to
his
baggage
and
in
my
condition
i
resolved
when
morning
broke
to
cast
away
all
but
a
and
a
hat
and
travel
henceforth
in
comfort
uso
del
but
alas
the
least
formal
of
us
can
not
rid
himself
of
all
the
adjuncts
of
civilization
and
there
was
photography
to
say
nothing
of
food
and
covering
for
the
highlands
ahead
to
be
considered
when
dawn
turned
its
light
upon
the
scene
the
dream
quickly
faded
and
i
settled
down
to
watch
another
day
drag
by
into
the
past
tense
beside
the
racing
brown
waters
of
the
huancabamba
the
feeling
was
rampant
that
nature
had
played
me
a
scurvy
trick
i
had
bargained
on
following
the
cool
and
pleasant
crest
of
the
andes
and
they
had
crumbled
away
beneath
me
and
forced
upon
me
this
unsought
experience
of
the
tropics
not
until
the
morning
of
the
third
day
did
the
balseros
conclude
to
attempt
to
pass
over
the
government
people
and
this
impatient
gringo
with
the
official
order
from
the
alcalde
the
raft
had
been
dragged
well
where
we
waded
to
it
through
bristling
jungle
and
mud
the
chasqui
s
horse
long
experienced
in
these
matters
from
years
of
carrying
the
mails
over
this
route
was
driven
in
and
forced
to
swim
to
a
well
out
in
the
stream
for
a
long
time
the
animal
stood
like
a
prisoner
at
bay
against
the
shouting
and
stoning
and
shaking
of
cudgels
of
those
on
the
bank
but
at
length
seeing
no
other
escape
it
set
out
to
attempt
the
main
branch
its
brute
instinct
would
have
proved
a
better
guide
than
the
opinions
of
more
rational
beings
struggling
until
its
snorting
echoed
back
from
the
surrounding
jungle
it
fought
the
brown
racing
waters
gradually
nearing
the
further
bank
yet
swept
even
more
swiftly
along
by
the
inexorable
stream
amid
from
the
rocky
passes
above
strained
savagely
to
reach
the
strip
of
beach
that
served
as
until
swept
past
it
without
gaining
a
footing
it
seemed
suddenly
to
give
up
in
despair
and
only
its
head
swinging
slowly
round
and
round
with
the
current
was
seen
a
short
minute
more
tiny
against
the
race
of
the
yellower
waters
before
it
swept
on
out
of
sight
down
the
torrent
the
chasqui
gazed
after
the
lost
animal
for
a
long
moment
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
the
resigned
vaya
of
a
confirmed
fatalist
and
took
his
seat
beside
me
on
our
baggage
tied
securely
near
the
back
of
the
frail
craft
the
three
brown
balseros
naked
but
for
hats
and
a
strip
of
rag
between
their
legs
each
crossed
himself
elaborately
and
took
a
deep
draught
at
anastasio
s
quart
bottle
of
cañazo
then
they
pointed
the
nose
of
the
raft
pushed
off
snatched
up
their
clumsy
paddles
with
a
hoarse
imploration
to
the
virgin
and
fought
for
dear
life
and
the
this
gained
we
disembarked
and
manoeuvered
to
the
further
side
then
pushed
off
into
the
main
stream
it
snatched
at
us
like
some
greedy
monster
the
raced
away
at
express
speed
the
further
bank
sped
past
like
a
blurred
cinematograph
ribbon
the
paddlers
urged
on
by
their
own
and
the
s
raucous
shouts
and
imprecations
battled
as
with
some
mortal
enemy
stabbing
their
paddles
in
swift
breathless
succession
into
the
brown
stream
and
following
each
dig
with
a
savage
jerk
that
tore
the
wound
wide
open
and
brought
out
the
lean
muscles
beneath
their
dingy
skins
like
steel
cables
under
leather
coverings
the
rules
of
caste
are
more
important
than
life
itself
in
south
america
and
both
the
and
i
had
been
refused
paddles
relentlessly
the
further
shore
galloped
by
the
bit
of
clearing
required
for
landing
approached
beckoned
to
us
tantalizingly
flashed
on
and
the
raft
sped
swiftly
after
the
lost
horse
the
balseros
abetted
by
the
chasqui
increased
their
efforts
to
a
screaming
uproar
in
which
i
caught
here
and
there
a
fragmentary
nta
virgen
yuda
fortunately
they
did
not
put
all
their
trust
in
superhuman
assistance
and
their
paddles
tore
at
the
stream
with
a
viciousness
that
drenched
us
with
its
aftermath
bit
by
bit
we
strained
nearer
the
hurrying
wall
of
verdure
every
lunge
seemed
to
lift
the
paddlers
into
the
air
the
cords
on
their
necks
stood
out
like
creepers
on
a
forest
tree
their
yells
hoarse
and
savage
enough
to
have
frightened
off
any
malignant
spirit
of
the
waters
came
strained
and
broken
now
from
lack
of
breath
now
we
could
all
but
touch
the
racing
i
snatched
in
vain
at
a
sapling
bowing
its
head
in
the
stream
with
a
last
faint
gasp
and
a
spent
stroke
the
balseros
dropped
their
paddles
on
the
raft
and
all
five
of
us
grasped
at
the
vegetation
that
tore
and
lacerated
us
in
its
struggle
to
escape
our
desperate
embrace
when
we
had
each
gathered
an
armful
of
it
we
clung
so
stoutly
to
this
last
hold
to
earth
that
the
raft
was
all
but
swept
from
under
us
before
we
swung
it
up
into
a
bit
of
cove
where
the
balseros
falling
at
once
into
their
racial
apathy
drooped
like
wilted
rags
at
the
bow
while
one
of
them
panted
weakly
a
little
more
señores
and
we
were
gone
as
lazily
as
they
had
been
energetic
in
the
crossing
the
ferrymen
coaxed
the
raft
up
along
the
edge
of
the
forest
to
the
little
clearing
where
i
swung
my
over
a
shoulder
waded
to
dry
land
and
plodded
on
along
the
blazing
hot
bank
of
the
huancabamba
slowly
my
shadow
crawled
from
under
my
feet
in
this
sweltering
desert
valley
now
staggering
through
hot
sand
and
a
dwarf
vegetation
savage
with
thorns
now
clambering
constantly
over
steep
headlands
that
broke
into
cliffs
at
the
river
s
edge
and
stumbling
down
again
through
veritable
quarries
of
loose
stones
my
burden
augmented
with
a
sack
of
rice
and
a
roll
of
beef
as
well
as
the
tropical
sun
that
seemed
to
lean
physically
on
my
shoulders
became
unbearable
i
resolved
to
pitch
camp
in
the
first
open
space
and
wait
till
doomsday
if
necessary
for
some
susceptible
to
the
glitter
of
silver
coins
puerto
sauce
was
probably
not
more
than
seven
miles
behind
me
when
i
found
between
trail
and
river
a
narrow
sloping
down
to
the
racing
brown
waters
and
backed
by
a
barren
stony
over
which
the
road
promised
to
bring
out
in
relief
against
the
sky
anyone
who
might
pass
my
way
grass
could
not
find
sustenance
on
this
spot
but
centipedes
and
a
score
of
other
venomous
things
might
exist
scattered
along
the
bank
were
many
sapling
poles
the
wreckage
evidently
of
some
hut
that
had
been
swept
here
by
the
raging
river
i
gathered
an
armful
of
these
and
laid
their
ends
on
two
small
logs
covered
them
with
such
brush
and
branches
as
were
without
thorns
and
had
a
far
more
comfortable
couch
than
the
wealthiest
hacendado
of
the
region
over
me
hung
a
wild
the
fruit
of
which
made
the
yellow
huancabamba
more
nearly
drinkable
about
its
trunk
within
instant
reach
i
strapped
my
revolver
and
lay
down
almost
in
the
royal
highway
fully
prepared
for
anything
except
a
sudden
burst
of
rain
across
the
river
in
dense
greener
jungle
were
the
huts
of
several
natives
but
they
might
as
well
have
been
in
another
world
for
i
could
not
have
heard
a
whisper
above
the
roar
of
the
huancabamba
had
they
stood
on
the
opposite
bank
screaming
across
at
me
i
possessed
a
maltreated
copy
of
prescott
and
there
is
great
compensation
for
the
hardships
of
the
trail
in
golden
moments
snatched
like
this
for
nowhere
does
the
mind
grip
the
printed
page
so
firmly
as
at
the
end
of
a
day
on
the
road
after
long
turning
the
leaves
of
no
other
page
than
nature
s
the
afternoon
passed
faded
to
a
violent
sunset
and
blackened
into
night
without
a
human
sight
or
sound
i
took
another
swim
careful
not
to
lose
my
grasp
on
the
shore
and
turned
my
lounge
into
a
bed
there
had
been
many
rumors
of
bears
and
tigers
in
these
parts
the
real
peril
was
the
incitement
to
suicide
caused
by
the
swarming
insect
life
whenever
the
breeze
failed
for
an
instant
in
my
dreams
the
roar
of
the
huancabamba
turned
to
that
of
new
york
and
i
fancied
i
had
suddenly
left
off
my
journey
down
the
andes
to
run
home
for
a
single
day
at
the
end
of
which
i
should
take
up
my
task
where
i
had
left
off
when
dawn
awoke
me
i
refused
to
rise
but
hour
after
hour
passed
without
a
break
in
the
drear
monotony
of
the
arid
landscape
in
patience
exploded
and
throwing
my
load
over
a
shoulder
i
toiled
on
when
at
the
end
of
some
fifteen
miles
my
legs
refused
to
push
me
further
i
struggled
through
the
jungle
to
the
but
there
was
not
a
cleared
space
sufficient
to
sit
on
much
less
to
lie
down
in
by
wading
i
reached
the
breezy
nose
of
an
island
in
the
huancabamba
and
made
my
bed
on
the
damp
but
i
had
chosen
poorly
if
choice
it
might
be
called
without
even
leaves
to
spread
under
me
the
night
was
one
of
unmitigated
torture
myriads
of
crawling
stinging
tropical
life
made
my
entire
frame
a
pasture
and
playground
and
at
best
i
got
only
a
few
snatches
of
sleep
troubled
with
the
threatening
rumble
of
the
river
for
safety
s
sake
i
had
hung
many
of
my
belongings
in
the
branches
of
trees
but
not
enough
of
them
daylight
showed
a
populous
colony
of
enormous
black
ants
in
possession
of
all
that
lay
on
the
ground
they
had
not
only
eaten
to
the
last
crumb
the
chancaca
i
had
lugged
for
two
blazing
days
and
left
me
barely
a
spoonful
of
rice
for
breakfast
but
they
had
all
but
destroyed
the
cover
of
my
kodak
had
decorated
my
hat
with
a
fringe
and
had
bitten
into
a
dozen
pieces
my

scattering
all
the
vicinity
with
crumbs
of
red
rubber
another
lone
day
we
struggled
i
say
we
is
myself
and
i
point
for
taking
up
my
own
load
again
i
could
not
rid
myself
of
the
fancy
that
i
was
two
distinct
persons
one
of
whom
was
forcing
the
other
to
make
the
journey
in
the
night
i
often
started
up
fancying
the
other
one
who
did
the
walking
and
carried
the
escaped
could
he
know
the
truth
beforehand
no
sane
man
would
sentence
himself
to
tramp
this
route
of
the
andes
to
suffer
almost
incessant
hardships
the
monotony
of
the
same
experiences
over
and
over
again
the
dreary
intercourse
with
a
people
so
stupid
so
low
of
intelligence
that
long
contact
with
their
childish
minds
brings
with
it
the
danger
of
one
s
own
faculties
turning
childish
like
that
of
a
lifetime
of
only
the
american
habit
of
carrying
out
to
the
bitter
end
a
plan
once
made
could
force
him
on
late
the
next
morning
the
most
exciting
event
of
several
days
happened
met
a
human
being
he
was
lolling
before
a
slatternly
hut
of
reeds
inside
which
a
woman
squatted
on
the
earth
peeling
on
such
a
journey
the
civilized
traveler
unconsciously
builds
up
a
certain
pity
for
himself
which
he
feels
should
be
shared
by
others
but
he
is
sure
of
a
rude
awakening
among
these
inhabitants
of
the
wilderness
should
a
living
skeleton
crawl
into
an
andean
hut
announcing
he
had
not
tasted
food
for
a
fortnight
had
seven
species
of
tropical
fever
and
had
been
bitten
by
a
baker
s
dozen
of
venomous
serpents
the
greeting
would
be
the
same
motionless
indifferent
grunt
and
drowsily
mumbled
vaya
with
which
this
female
acknowledged
my
presence
no
offer
of
money
would
have
brought
her
to
her
feet
much
less
have
induced
her
to
cook
one
of
the
even
yellow
overran
the
place
as
i
picked
up
my
burden
in
disgust
however
she
murmured
through
her
lips
se
irá
usté
almorzando
other
words
that
i
might
wait
if
i
chose
to
partake
of
the
camote
stew
she
was
lazily
concocting
over
the
stick
fire
in
the
center
of
the
floor
on
the
surface
this
stereotyped
invitation
looks
like
genuine
hospitality
at
bottom
it
is
less
so
than
a
habit
tinged
with
superstition
and
fear
of
malignant
spirits
and
above
all
the
impossibility
of
an
uninitiative
race
daring
to
or
even
thinking
of
varying
a
custom
of
all
their
known
world
it
was
no
time
to
stand
on
my
dignity
however
even
had
the
foodless
days
behind
left
me
any
such
support
and
i
sat
down
again
a
ravenous
two
hours
dragged
by
before
the
mess
of
native
roots
and
herbs
met
the
approval
of
the
expressionless
female
who
tasted
a
wooden
spoonful
of
it
now
and
then
and
tossed
the
residue
back
into
the
kettle
several
peons
had
drifted
in
genuine
human
clods
apparently
as
devoid
of
intelligence
as
the
hogs
rooting
about
under
their
hoofed
feet
and
gathered
about
a
flat
log
raised
a
bit
above
the
earth
with
a
steaming
calabash
of
the
tasteless
stew
before
each
of
us
and
a
single
bowl
of
mixed
with
bits
of
pork
rind
into
which
all
shovelled
at
once
we
finished
the
meal
in
utter
silence
then
the
first
peon
wiping
his
horny
hand
across
his
mouth
with
a
disgusting
sucking
sound
mumbled
diós
se
lo
pagará
a
formula
repeated
by
each
as
we
rose
to
our
feet
however
much
he
may
prefer
to
liquidate
the
matter
himself
rather
than
to
leave
it
to
so
uncertain
and
unindebted
a
source
this
god
will
pay
you
for
it
is
the
only
return
the
traveler
who
sits
in
at
their
tasteless
repasts
can
force
upon
these
mongrel
people
of
the
andean
wilderness
how
far
out
of
my
course
i
had
mounted
the
huancabamba
when
i
picked
up
a
tributary
along
the
only
a
professional
geographer
could
say
through
the
of
northern
peru
direction
yields
to
the
accidents
of
nature
and
jaen
had
been
as
far
east
of
a
line
due
southward
as
ayavaca
had
been
to
the
west
when
early
sunset
fell
in
the
bottom
of
the
deep
valley
i
had
mounted
several
hundred
feet
above
the
level
of
the
huancabamba
and
with
a
welcome
coolness
came
more
human
manners
heralding
the
highlands
again
both
fructuoso
carrera
and
his
far
younger
though
no
less
cheery
wife
treated
me
more
like
a
prodigal
son
than
as
an
importunate
guest
who
had
fallen
upon
them
out
of
the
unknown
amid
the
culinary
operations
suited
to
my
case
they
gave
me
in
detail
the
recipe
of
the
bread
probably
used
before
the
finally
rounded
off
our
repast
late
in
the
evening
for
the
benefit
of
housewives

me
to
pass
on

off

kernels
of
green
corn

still
small
and
fairly
soft
crush
them
to
a
a
round
stone
on

broad
flat

out
beneath
the
thatched
eaves
if
it
is
desired
to
keep
the
local
color

lightly
on
the
mass
from
time
to
time
when
the
whole
has
been
reduced
to
a
somewhat
adhesive
dough

in
rolls
of
the
stuff
about
the
size
and
shape
of
an
ear
of

sit
down
on

in
a
corner
of

packages
one
by
one
into
a
kettle
of
boiling
water
supported
by
three
stones
let
boil
from
twenty
minutes
to
a
half
on
the
energy
with
which
fagots
have
been
gathered
during
the
care
that
none
of
the
gaunt
curs
prowling
about
between
the
legs
of
the
cook
and
through
other
unexpected
openings
thrust
their
noses
into
the
kettle
as
they
would
be
sure
to
be
burned
those
who
succeed
in
beginning
the
task
while
daylight
still
lingers
should
also
beware
any
of
the
family
chickens
climbing
to
a
convenient
shoulder
and
springing
into
the
pot
as
this
would
result
not
in

but
in

is
a
far
more
expensive

added
by
a
successful
attempt
surreptitiously
to
get
into

a
couple
of
the
choclo

the
land
of
starvation
that
is
expected
ahead
several
times
during
the
night

descended
to
alleviate
my
skin
by
a
plunge
in
the
clear
cold
mountain
stream
that
sounds
in
the
carrera
family
ears
days
a
year
in
the
morning
i
was
forced
to
dress
under
my
poncho
with
far
less
convenience
than
in
an
upper
pullman
berth
for

already
grinding

for

owed

anything

that
day
the
trail
wandering
back
and
forth
across
the
river
first
by
little
thatched
or
then
as
the
stream
dwindled
by
precarious
climbed
ever
higher
at
times
through
stretches
of
mud
where
dense
overhanging
forests
had
retained
the
rainfall
mankind
grew
more
frequent
in
this
more
habitable
rising
world
thatched
cottages
were
tucked
away
here
and
there
in
patches
of
bananas
and
coffee
and
the
pilfering
of
the
tandas
to
weigh
down
my
load
proved
an
entirely
gratuitous
felony
the
very
air
of
tablabamba
where
i
slept
on
dried
in
an
unwalled
hung
well
up
the
side
of
the
new
constricted
valley
as
humid
and
green
as
jaen
province
had
been
and
arid
teemed
with
stories
of
robbers
and
assassins
among
the
mountain
defiles
ahead
the
only
visible
danger
i
encountered
however
was
the
notorious
it
if
you
can
the
terrors
of
which
had
grown
daily
more
persistent
for
a
fortnight
past
this
was
one
of
those
endless
zigzags
by
which
andean
trails
climb
from
one
river
system
when
near
its
source
to
another
revealing
its
nefarious
purpose
only
bit
by
bit
and
subtly
enticing
the
traveler
ever
upward
in
an
undertaking
he
might
not
have
the
courage
to
face
as
a
whole
a
rut
piled
full
of
loose
rocks
down
which
trickled
enough
water
to
suggest
what
the
climb
might
have
been
on
a
rainy
day
carried
me
into
the
very
sky
above
and
taking
there
new
foothold
scaled
doggedly
on
into
the
realms
of
eternal
silence
where
even
birds
were
no
longer
heard
and
sturdy
squat
trees
sighing
fitfully
as
if
struggling
for
breath
at
length
gave
up
in
despair
and
abandoned
the
scene
to
huge
black
rocks
protruding
from
a
soil
that
gave
sustenance
only
to
the
of
andean
heights

my
host
of
the
night
had
mumbled
lugubriously
but
i
was
aware
only
of
the
music
of
the
wind
and
the
joyful
realization
that
the
broken
mountains
had
gathered
themselves
together
again
under
my
feet
and
raised
me
once
more
to
my
accustomed
temperate
zone
by
cold
noonday
a
tumbled
blue
world
lay
about
and
below
me
only
an
insignificant
dent
in
it
representing
that
overheated
hell
locally
known
as
the
province
of
jaen
like
life
itself
what
had
seemed
at
its
base
a
mighty
climb
proved
here
at
the
top
to
have
been
only
an
insignificant
little
knoll
down
in
the
valley
and
only
when
one
had
reached
the
real
summit
and
could
look
back
upon
the
region
as
a
whole
after
all
was
accomplished
did
each
little
struggle
and
petty
suffering
assume
its
correct
proportion

in
one
of
the
most
magnificent
highland
valleys
of
the
andes
another
step
forward
and
before
my
glad
eyes
spread
one
of
those
broad
green
interandean
valleys
backed
by
serrated
black
ranges
their
brows
wrinkled
and
furrowed
with
age
the
clouds
trailing
their
purple
shadows
across
a
panorama
of
little
cultivated
valleys
into
which
i
descended
from
the
unconscionable
summit
by
a
natural
stairway
the
peaks
turned
to
lilac
in
the
last
rays
of
the
chill
highland
sun
then
faded
away
into
the
luminous
sky
of
night
as
the
mountain
cold
settled
down
like
an
icy
poncho
and
with
dusk
i
tramped
through
a
long
adobe
street
into
the
central
plaza
of
cutervo
my
legs
seemed
to
have
pushed
me
again
into
the
outskirts
of
civilization
not
only
did
the
subprefect
drive
off
of
his
own
initiative
the
throng
that
gathered
about
his
door
rather
than
read
my
papers
aloud
to
them
but
here
at
last
was
a
peruvian
town
that
actually
recognized
the
existence
of
strangers
with
appetites
and
a
large
adobe
hut
publicly
admitted
itself
a
cutervo
was
in
reality
monotonously
like
any
other
town
of
the
sierra
to
one
coming
upon
it
out
of
the
trackless
wilderness
however
it
seemed
at
first
sight
a
place
of
mighty
importance
and
only
gradually
dwindled
to
its
true
proportions
like
a
man
just
returned
from
long
months
in
the
polar
ice
i
had
an
all
but
irresistible
desire
to
rush
in
and
buy
everything
in
sight
as
i
wandered
past
its
long
line
of
open
the
capital
of
a
department
recently
cut
off
from
the
neighboring
one
of
chota
it
was
the
first
place
in
peru
where
any
appreciable
number
of
the
inhabitants
could
unreservedly
be
called
white
and
boasted
the
first
specimens
of
beauty
among
the
fair
sex
even
the
lima
newspapers
were
there
to
give
me
a
skeleton
sketch
of
the
activities
of
a
world
there
is
a
reserve
of
strength
in
the
human
body
which
few
suspect
until
they
tax
it
in
an
emergency
but
it
is
only
after
recovery
that
the
traveler
through
the
rough
places
of
the
earth
realizes
how
weak
he
has
gradually
become
from
hardships
and
lack
of
real
nourishment
the
invigorating
air
of
the
temperate
zone
and
the
meat
of
cutervo
s
fonda
however
had
soon
given
me
new
energy
and
seemed
to
have
reduced
to
half
the
weight
of
my
load
hope
brutally
felled
to
earth
ever
crawls
dizzily
to
its
feet
again
i
could
no
more
rid
myself
of
the
fond
dream
of
some
day
ceasing
to
stagger
under
my
own
baggage
than
a
leper
can
shake
off
his
affliction
yet
the
solemn
promise
of
the
ruler
of
cutervo
to
furnish
me
a
carrier
resulted
only
in
a
lost
day
and
i
struck
off
across
the
rolling
mountains
and
valleys
beyond
convinced
at
last
so
i
fancied
that
i
should
dream
no
longer
so
persistent
had
been
the
promise
of
foul
play
on
this
day
s
route
that
despite
a
lifetime
of
disappointments
i
could
not
but
peer
hopefully
into
the
many
splendid
of
the
wild
upland
i
followed
in
utter
solitude
all
the
gorgeous
day
from
cutervo
to
chota
the
next
provincial
capital
only
once
did
i
catch
sight
of
a
group
of
arrieros
with
laden
asses
paused
dubiously
near
the
top
of
the
range
where
they
caught
the
first
glimpse
of
me
then
ventured
forward
and
halted
to
ask
anxiously
are
the
robbers
not
attacking
this
morning
my
answer
they
greeted
with
a
fervent
ave
maría
purísima
and
crossing
themselves
ostentatiously
that
the
saints
should
not
by
any
chance
overlook
their
devotion
pushed
hurriedly
on
toward
cutervo
early
in
the
afternoon
i
came
out
on
the
upper
edge
of
an
enormous
valley
just
across
which
in
the
lap
of
a
rolling
plain
sloping
toward
me
and
the
winding
river
at
its
bottom
lay
the
end
of
the
day
s
journey
a
tiny
patch
in
a
immensity
of
world
the
two
towers
of
its
not
too
conspicuous
church
the
horizon
in
the
transparent
air
of
the
highlands
it
seemed
at
most
a
short
two
hours
away
in
reality
i
had
not
in
that
time
picked
my
stony
way
to
the
bottom
of
the
valley
and
it
was
long
after
night
had
cast
its
black
poncho
over
all
the
world
that
i
stumbled
at
last
into
the
elusive
town
chota
feet
inhabitants
doors
no
windows
nearly
as
cold
as
quito
is
a
provincial
capital
with
streets
and
a
broad
expanse
of
plaza
all
tilting
to
the
north
by
far
the
largest
peruvian
city
i
had
yet
seen
almost
the
equal
in
size
of
loja
in
ecuador
the
stock
of
its
many
little
shops
comes
in
by
way
of
pacasmayo
and
the
railroad
to
chilete
showing
that
i
was
over
the
divide
and
approaching
cajamarca
on
august
it
was
destroyed
by
the
los
malditos
chilenos
as
the
inhabitants
still
call
andean
building
material
being
plentiful
it
soon
rose
from
its
mud
ruins
the
cura
was
even
then
superintending
the
cholos
tramping
together
with
their
bare
feet
the
clay
and
chopped
that
was
to
be
a
new
church
there
were
numerous
fondas
as
befitted
a
great
capital
that
is
mud
dens
with
a
reed
shanty
in
the
barnyard
behind
serving
as
kitchen
kept
by
but
unprepossessing
females
who
wiped
the
inside
of
each
plate
religiously
on
their
ample
hips
those
same
hips
on
which
they
squatted
on
the
earth
floor
to
fill
the
receptacles
similarly
placed
while
driving
off
with
the
free
hand
the
curs
and
and
the
chickens
perching
on
the
edge
of
the
kettles
there
were
even
in
a
few
of
the
more
pretentious
shops
and
mansions
though
almost
all
without
chimneys
not
easily
imported
from
the
other
side
of

world
by
ship
and
muleback
over
breakneck
trails
haughty
belligerent
roosters
stood
tied
by
a
leg
before
half
the
doors
in
town
so
that
each
street
was
a
long
vista
of
pugnacious
cocks
frequently
submitting
to
the
anxious
ministrations
of
their
proud
owners
even
without
them
i
should
not
have
slept
unbrokenly
official
assistance
had
gained
me
lodging
on
the
counter
of
an
empty
shop
hung
with
cobwebs
and
perfumed
with
the
mustiness
of
several
generations
the
door
of
which
flush
with
the
narrow
sidewalk
of
course
was
the
only
source
of
air
there
as
often
as
a
passed
on
his
way
home
from
the
local
billar
he
paused
to
beat
me
awake
with
the
rapping
of
his
cane
and
to
in
that
dulcet
voice
of
the
mellow
with
late
hours
your
door
is
open
señor
i
will
close
it
for
and
if
instead
of
reaching
under
the
counter
for
my
revolver
or
a
convenient
adobe
brick
i
did
not
summon
a
patient
courtesy
i
do
not
possess
and
answer
mil
gracias
señor
no
thank
you
leave
it
open
please
and
then
rise
and
open
it
again
because
he
fancied
his
ears
had
deceived
him
i
should
have
lost
the
rating
of
simpático
and
been
branded
a
rude
and
discourteous
gringo
bambamarca
an
atrociously
stony
beyond
chota
and
its
surrounding
bowl
like
a
mosaic
of
little
farms
where
female
shepherds
bare
to
their
knees
incessantly
turn
the
white
brown
and
black
fleece
of
their
flocks
into
yarn
on
their
crude
incaic
spindles
reported
the
trail
ahead
the
worst
road
in
peru
is
indeed
strong
language
they
were
certain
too
that
though
i
the
accent
on
the
arrived
from
la
provincia
alive
the
marauders
beyond
would
see
to
it
that
i
did
not
reach
cajamarca
in
that
condition
a
cold
rain
fell
incessantly
from
sullen
skies
during
a
day
of
unbroken
plodding
first
up
the
cañon
of
a
small
river
crossed
now
and
then
by
thatched
bridges
until
it
dwindled
away
and
left
me
to
splash
at
random
over
a
reeking
i
had
been
lost
for
hours
and
was
dripping
water
at
every
pore
when
i
spied
toward
what
would
have
been
sunset
four
little
indian
boys
huddled
under
the
ruin
of
a
hut
and
signed
to
them
to
give
me
information
instead
they
took
to
their
heels
as
if
all
the
evil
spirits
of
the
inca
religion
had
suddenly
crested
the
range
i
set
after
them
but
my
best
pace
under
my
load
being
barely
equal
to
theirs
i
drew
my
revolver
and
fired
twice
into
the
air
whereupon
they
halted
and
awaited
me
in
ashen
fear
the
one
i
chose
as
guide
led
me
over
a
rolling
páramo
deeply
gashed
by
streams
and
abandoned
me
within
sight
of
the
imposing
of
what
turned
out
to
be
the
hacienda
in
the
corredor
just
out
of
reach
of
the
drenching
rain
stood
a
white
man
in
khaki
monarch
of
half
the
visible
world
and
so
little
like
the
uncouth
illiterate
i
expected
that
he
replied
in
faultless
castilian
to
my
remark
about
the
absence
of
roads
yes
unfortunately
south
america
fell
to
the
spaniards
whereas
it
should
have
been
settled
by
here
for
the
first
time
in
peru
was
an
hacendado
who
had
trained
his
dogs
and
servants
to
some
understanding
of
their
respective
spheres
and
had
even
given
the
latter
an
inkling
of
that
thin
gray
line
between
cleanliness
and
its
opposite
a
trivial
incident
will
demonstrate
to
what
lowly
point
of
view
my
recent
experiences
had
brought
me
when
my
host
showed
me
into
a
large
i
caught
sight
in
the
of
a
reed
mat
on
the
floor
and
through
me
flashed
a
thrill
of
joy
that
i
should
have
this
to
sleep
on
instead
of
the
cold
dank
tiles
whereas
on
closer
view
this
proved
to
be
the
before
a
huge
colonial
bedstead
regally
furnished
with
soft
mattresses
and
spotless
woolen
blankets
my
host
even
apologized
for
the
absence
of
sheets
as
if
i
should
have
recognized
that
forgotten
flora
even
in
its
native
habitat
yet
my
misgivings
of
playing
the
rôle
of
hugo
s
maltreated
hero
materialized
whether
it
was
due
to
the
fever
within
me
struggling
for
existence
or
to
the
return
to
luxury
i
tossed
sleeplessly
well
into
the
night
and
it
was
rolled
up
on
the
mat
on
the
tile
floor
that
the
cold
dawn
creeping
in
at
the
windows
found
me
the
road
across
soggy
highland
meadows
and
past
those
fantastic
peaks
and
splintered
ranges
of
black
rocks
that
give
the
hacienda
yanacancha
black
rocks
its
name
was
largely
imaginary
at
first
within
sprinting
distance
of
the
house
were
a
few
inhabited
haycocks
of
shepherds
like
esquimaux
dwellings
of
in
place
of
snow
and
ice
with
a
hole
to
crawl
in
at
on
all
fours
then
the
visible
world
straining
ever
higher
spread
out
into
a
rolling
a
totally
uninhabited
region
where
was
heard
only
the
mournful
sighing
of
the
wind
across
a
boundless
rolling
sea
of
the
dreary
of
the
upper
andes
across
it
the
often
invisible
way
undulated
with
such
regularity
that
i
was
continually
descending
into
or
climbing
out
of
hollows
trodden
to
a
mud
pudding
about
the
cold
streams
that
wandered
down
from
the
scarcely
more
lofty
heights
there
were
myriad
behind
the
jagged
gray
rocks
piled
erratically
along
the
way
from
which
might
have
picked
me
off
so
notorious
is
this
region
for
its
mishaps
to
travelers
that
natives
rarely
cross
it
except
in
large
groups
but
the
wholesome
respect
in
which
a
gringo
especially
one
who
carries
a
prominently
displayed
is
held
is
the
best
protection
in
far
more
so
than
an
escort
of
native
soldiers
the
presence
of
which
is
apt
to
imply
to
the
lurking
bandit
an
admission
of
inability
to
depend
on
one
s
gringo
self
even
if
the
soldiers
do
not
prove
confederates
of
the
outlaws
or
run
away
at
sight
of
them
on
and
ever
on
the
cold
desolate
inhospitable
despoblado
rose
and
fell
in
broad
swells
or
billows
the
barren
yellow
uninhabited
world
sighing
mournfully
to
itself
this
long
day
is
obligatory
on
all
who
come
to
cajamarca
from
the
north
for
there
is
no
in
all
the
expanse
of
puna
south
of
yanacancha
i
should
have
covered
the
miles
before
the
day
was
done
had
not
a
long
dormant
or
newly
acquired
fever
suddenly
broken
out
in
every
setting
of
one
leg
before
the
other
was
as
great
an
effort
as
jumping
over
a
yet
i
must
prod
myself
pitilessly
on
for
to
be
overtaken
by
night
on
this
inhospitable
puna
would
have
been
worse
than
fever
with
infinite
struggle
i
came
at
last
to
where
this
broadest
of
páramos
began
to
fall
away
toward
the
north
then
the
slope
contracted
to
a
gully
that
gathered
together
the
score
or
more
of
separate
but
not
distinct
paths
that
make
up
the
highway
across
the
lofty
plain
and
brought
me
before
sunset
to
the
first
of
a
scattered
cluster
of
stone
and
mud
kennels
a
old
indian
speaking
the
first
quichua
i
had
heard
since
cuenca
gave
me
a
handful
of
to
sit
on
outside
the
smaller
of
his
two
huts
and
left
me
to
the
company
of
his
prowling
yellow
curs
night
had
fallen
completely
before
a
woman
brought
me
a
gourd
of
boiling
potato
mush
but
at
length
the
chary
old
indian
overcoming
his
racial
indifference
and
distrust
opened
the
door
of
the
hut
against
which
i
lay
and
let
me
into
a
sort
of
incaic
warehouse
in
it
were
heaps
of
the
huge
balls
of
yarn
spun
by
the
indian
women
on
their
prehistoric
spindles
a
supply
of
páramo
grass
i
might
spread
on
the
earth
floor
and
several
large
bolts
of
homespun
cloth
of
coarse
texture
and
cruder
colors
with
which
i
might
feather
my
arctic
nest
once
it
was
late
enough
to
hope
the
owner
would
not
catch
me
at
it
in
the
adjoining
family
hut
a
baby
had
been
crying
incessantly
for
an
hour
or
more
the
of
the
fever
was
settling
upon
me
when
a
young
indian
entered
bearing
the
infant
and
a
handful
of
twisted
grass
as
torch
without
preliminary
he
requested
me
if
i
understood
his
language
to
spit
in
the
child
s
face
i
don
t
get
you
i
replied
in
my
most
colloquial
if
imperfect
quichua
do
me
the
favor
to
spit
in
its
face
he
repeated
and
by
way
of
illustration
spat
swiftly
and
lightly
with
the
point
of
his
tongue
between
his
lips
a
fine
spray
in
the
face
of
the
squalling
infant
but
why
not
do
it
yourself
i
protested
manam
viracocha
it
must
be
some
one
the
guaguita
does
not
when
it
had
become
evident
that
there
was
no
other
way
of
being
left
in
peace
i
rose
and
sprayed
the
infant
to
my
astonishment
it
ceased
its
wailing
instantly
stared
into
my
face
until
the
father
turned
away
and
was
not
again
heard
during
the
night
benedicts
may
adopt
this
bit
of
domestic
science
from
the
ancient
civilization
of
the
incas
free
of
charge
there
were
but
nine
miles
left
to
do
in
the
morning
but
the
mere
numeral
gives
little
hint
of
the
real
task
both
road
and
bridges
continued
strikingly
conspicuous
by
their
absence
for
hours
the
atrocious
trail
zigzagged
unevenly
at
times
almost
perpendicularly
down
what
was
left
of
the
mountainside
then
it
forded
the
cajamarca
river
and
joining
a
procession
of
indians
with
a
clashing
of
colors
almost
equal
to
those
of
quito
picked
its
way
around
stony
foothills
along
a
slowly
widening
valley
gradually
checkered
with
the
varying
greens
of
cultivation
the
cool
summer
air
and
a
more
passable
road
drew
me
ever
more
swiftly
on
the
sound
of
musically
distant
floating
northward
on
the
breeze
located
vaguely
somewhere
among
the
eucalyptus
trees
ahead
the
end
of
the
third
stage
of
my
andean
journey
huts
turned
to
houses
thicker
and
thicker
along
the
way
until
they
grew
together
into
two
unbroken
rows
the
air
grew
heavy
with
the
scent
of
the
australian
gum
i
passed
under
an
aged
whitewashed
arch
straddling
the
street
and
on
april
at
the
hour
of
the
return
from
mass
found
myself
creaking
along
the
canted
flagstone
sidewalks
of
famous
old
cajamarca
the
first
real
city
even
in
the
sense
i
had
come
upon
in
peru
armed
and
bedraggled
with
an
alforja
hanging
heavy
over
one
shoulder
i
presented
no
conventional
sight
yet
the
cajamarquinos
gave
me
comparatively
slight
attention
no
doubt
they
were
accustomed
to
such
apparitions
pizarro
and
his
could
have
been
little
less
and
when
they
rode
in
upon
cajamarca
over
these
same
hills
according
to
careful
calculation
i
had
walked
miles
from
bogotá
from
quito
of
the
days
from
the
ecuadorian
capital
i
had
spent
thirty
in
the
towns
and
hamlets
along
the
way
and
the
remainder
in
whole
or
part
on
the
road
as
far
back
as
ayavaca
i
had
begun
to
hear
praises
of
the
magnificent
hotels
of
cajamarca
the
disappointment
was
proportionately
bitter
the
hotel
internacional
was
a
defunct
the
hotel
amazonas
further
on
merely
a
row
of
rooms
opening
on
the
balcony
they
were
tolerable
rooms
with
flagstone
floors
and
wooden
and
had
the
extraordinary
advantage
of
being
in
the
second
story
out
of
reach
of
staring
passersby
but
they
were
furnished
only
with
the
bare
necessities
and
were
covered
everywhere
with
a
more
or
less
of
dust
this
was
hardly
to
be
wondered
at
pizarro
and
his
band
of
tramps
must
have
raised
a
deuce
of
a
dust
when
they
perpetrated
the
conquest
of
peru
and
took
atahuallpa
into
their
tender
keeping
in
the
great
plaza
a
short
block
away
on
that
saturday
evening
years
before
strangest
of
all
the
hotel
rates
were
posted
in
plain
sight
where
even
foreigners
might
see
forty
cents
a
night
or
thirty
if
the
room
was
occupied
a
month
or
more
evidently
another
fussy
gringo
had
been
here
before
me
for
the
printed
rules
contained
the
following
bylaw
the
señor
passenger
who
shall
desire
to
use
two
mattresses
on
the
same
bed
will
subject
himself
to
the
payment
of
ten
cents
above
the
ordinary
the
original
motive
could
not
have
been
hays
for
the
notice
was
yellow
with
time
and
the
though
he
gave
me
many
details
of
the
doings
of
my
erstwhile
companion
as
he
gradually
got
my
indispensable
requirements
together
with
great
care
not
to
remove
the
historic
dust
anywhere
did
not
mention
any
such
gringo
idiosyncrasy
every
of
cajamarca
be
he
a
tawny
indian
from
up
in
the
hills
or
the
representative
of
some
ambitious
european
house
eats
in
one
of
two
chinese
or
restaurants
not
far
off
the
main
plaza
the
transient
enters
a
celestial
passes
through
it
and
a
dingy
room
crowded
with
tables
about
which
barefoot
indians
male
and
female
their
aged
felt
hats
on
their
heads
are
helping
themselves
with
spoons
or
fingers
and
through
another
doorless
door
into
a
smaller
chamber
with
a
single
long
table
covered
by
an
oilcloth
of
long
and
troubled
history
where
he
is
sure
to
find
a
place
because
of
the
requirement
of
shoes
during
the
process
he
will
pass
close
by
the
open
kitchen
with
its
iron
first
i
had
seen
in
south
by
a
grizzled
old
chinaman
the
service
is
à
la
carte
and
but
for
the
shoes
and
oilcloth
identical
in
both
here
one
will
find
a
greasy
strip
of
paper
with
a
printed
menu
easily
comprehensible
to
anyone
with
a
spanish
and
quichua
dictionary
a
treatise
on
peruvian
coast
slang
and
some
smacking
of
chinese
in
spanish
misspelling
or
which
in
the
very
likely
event
of
the
client
being
unable
to
read
the
barefoot
waiter
will
recite
in
shakespearean
cadence
and
breathless
continuity
indeed
but
for
the
language
one
might
fancy
oneself
back

it
is
seven
degrees
below
the
equator
and
somewhat
warmer
than
quito
it
stands
meters
above
the
sea
with
some
inhabitants
for
every
meter
in
all
but
its
history
it
is
tiresomely
like
any
other
city
of
the
andes
the
streets
monotonously
are
rudely
cobbled
with
open
sewers
down
the
center
the
sidewalks
narrow
flagstones
on
which
he
who
would
walk
must
jostle
indians
donkeys
and
stagnant
groups
of
less
useful
residents
the
adobe
houses
often
and
always
toeing
the
are
roofed
and
anciently
whitewashed
dingy
little
shops
of
odds
and
ends
below
the
patios
of
even
the
families
are
surrounded
on
the
ground
floor
by
the
dens
of
servants
and
the
ragged
and
more
numerous
population
as
in
quito
it
was
the
first
place
in
peru
where
i
had
seen
by
night
its
streets
are
lighted
with
miniature
kerosene
lamps
inside
square
lanterns
that
are
given
to
succumbing
to
the
first
strong
puff
of
breeze
even
if
those
whose
duty
it
is
to
light
them
do
not
have
more
pressing
engagements
the
central
plaza
is
enormous
square
in
form
but
coinciding
more
or
less
with
the
triangular
one
in
which
pizarro
and
the
inca
collided
on
that
dusty
saturday
evening
of
an
earlier
century
tended
with
less
monotonous
formality
than
those
of
quito
bloom
chiefly
with
geraniums
and
among
them
the
historically
informed
inhabitants
point
out
the
stone
on
which
atahuallpa
succumbed
to
the
amid
the
ministrations
of
good
old
father
greenvale
as
in
quito
there
remain
almost
no
monuments
of
days
for
the
incas
seem
to
have
built
here
chiefly
of
adobe
the
most
intelligent
of
cajamarca
s
monks
doubted
whether
there
was
even
a
temple
of
the
sun
or
a
house
of
the
virgins
to
transform
into
monastery
or
convent
not
far
off
the
main
plaza
however
set
cornerwise
in
the
center
of
a
modern
block
is
the
room
that
was
to
be
filled
with
gold
for
atahuallpa
s
ransom
said
to
be
of
massive
dressed
stone
like
the
palaces
of
cuzco
stevenson
who
was
in
cajamarca
just
a
hundred
years
before
me
found
still
visible
around
the
wall
the
mark
that
was
to
measure
the
height
of
the
treasure
and
the
room
the
residence
of
a
cacique
it
is
an
orphanage
where
a
german
nun
was
teaching
a
score
of
female
orphans
to
earn
a
livelihood
on
american
and
the
as
well
as
all
evidence
of
stone
structure
had
been
whitewashed
out
of
existence
as
something
of
los
gentiles
not
worth
preserving
the
unique
characteristic
of
cajamarca
and
almost
her
only
stone
buildings
are
her
splendid
old
churches
by
time
as
those
of
salamanca
and
having
the
appearance
of
being
by
earthquakes
the
natives
asserted
however
that
they
were
left
incomplete
because
in
colonial
days
every
finished
building
must
pay
tribute
to
the
king
of
spain
whatever
the
cause
their
condition
gives
an
unusual
architectural
effect
that
could
not
have
been
equalled
by
any
design
of
man
and
all
who
find
pleasure
in
the
picturesque
must
hope
that
cajamarca
will
never
grow
wealthy
enough
to
finish
misfortune
that
is
not
imminent
the
chilians
came
in
august
and
taking
a
note
from
pizarro
s
more
exactly
from
that
of
his
secretary
since
the
of
estremadura
was
not
fitted
to
keep
his
all
the
gold
and
jewels
of
the
churches
even
the
laboratory
equipment
of
the
schools
and
anything
else
that
chanced
to
be
lying
around
though
they
found
no
one
worth
holding
for
ransom
one
of
the
principal
churches
bears
an
inscription
now
all
but
effaced
by
the
ubiquitous
whitewash
announcing
that
this
santa
eglesia
was
erected
at
the
cost
of
one
million
pesos
and
fifteen
centavos
the
extra
seven
cents
being
the
cost
of
in
the
great
monastery
of
san
francisco
facing
the
main
plaza
some
forty
amiable
but
ignorant
friars
loll
through
life
chiefly
in
the
breezy
retiring
kiosk
carpeted
like
that
of
quito
with
burnt
matches
and
cigarette
butts
they
knew
nothing
of
the
tomb
of
atahuallpa
but
the
spanish
organist
who
looked
like
a
baseball
fan
on
a
hot
day
led
me
to
the
church
and
played
in
my
honor
on
the
largest
and
best
in
peru
not
only
our
national
air
but
several
spanish
fandangos
and
a
recent
broadway
favorite
that
is
seldom
admitted
to
ecclesiastical
circles
the
indians
and
gente
del
pueblo
of
cajamarca
have
nearly
as
much
color
of
dress
as
those
of
quito
and
are
even
more
ragged
and
abjectly
filthy
maimed
beggars
adorn
the
façades
of
churches
and
the
aboriginals
speak
a
mushy
mouthful
dialect
of
quichua
though
all
know
spanish
none
of
the
chinese
residents
have
families
yet
every
now
and
then
one
passes
a
child
with
quaintly
shaped
eyes
that
testify
to
the
ingratiating
manners
of
the
celestials
the
upper
classes
struggle
to
keep
the
theoretically
white
collars
and
the
dandified
shoes
that
mark
their
caste
and
dawdle
through
life
as
shopkeepers
lawyers
without
clients
doctors
whose
degrees
furnish
them
little
but
the
title
or
at
any
makeshift
occupation
that
will
spare
them
from
soiling
their
tapering
fingers
with
vulgar
labor
opportunity
is
a
rare
visitor
yet
in
a
century
perhaps
there
has
not
been
born
in
cajamarca
a
boy
with
the
initiative
and
energy
to
tramp
three
days
over
the
western
range
and
stow
away
for
somewhere
that
he
could
make
a
man
of
himself
as
to
personal
habits
a
drug
clerk
graduated
in
lima
pours
out
of
their
bottles
the
pills
he
recommends
and
plays
them
idly
back
and
forth
from
one
unwashed
hand
to
the
other
before
returning
them
to
the
shelf
yet
it
was
a
relief
to
loll
away
several
days
in
civilization
even
peruvianly
speaking
if
the
passing
stranger
was
not
entirely
free
from
the
open
mouth
and
vacant
eye
he
could
pass
a
corner
group
without
all
falling
silent
and
craning
their
necks
after
him
and
might
even
sit
down
at
the
fonda
table
without
all
interrupting
their
noisy
eating
to
mumble
over
their
mouthful
where
do
you
come
from
and
where
are
you
going
but
even
a
peruvian
department
capital
has
not
yet
reached
that
stage
which
makes
photography
easy
or
the
coarsest
sarcasm
effective
as
often
as
i
opened
my
kodak
some
educated
member
of
society
was
sure
to
crowd
close
to
me
keeping
persistently
in
front
of
the
lens
and
when
i
had
at
length
manoeuvered
and
tricked
him
out
of
the
view
more
or
less
i
was
seeking
he
was
certain
to
bleat
with
his
blandest
smile
sacando
una
plancha
no
señor
if
i
made
answer
no
my
esteemed
friend
of
ancient
and
noble
blood
i
am
building
an
aeroplane
on
to
cross
the
icy
stretches
of
the
amazon
the
son
of
the
wilderness
might
reflect
solemnly
a
moment
or
two
before
making
some
such
inane
reply
as
yes
it
a
long
way
to
the
almost
at
the
hour
of
my
arrival
an
enamored
youth
of
cajamarca
committed
suicide
leaving
a
letter
in
which
he
declared
life
was
a
farce
had
he
been
with
me
through
the
province
of
jaen
he
would
have
found
it
more
nearly
a
melodrama
only
those
who
have
endured
the
hardships
of
a
long
trail
can
know
the
compensating
pleasure
of
a
return
to
even
comparative
comfort
like
the
burgeoning
of
spring
after
a
hard
winter
but
after
all
the
joys
of
the
trail
in
the
andes
are
chiefly
those
of
anticipation
and
the
sense
of
accomplishment
of
in
tramping
where
few
men
have
tramped
before
for
there
can
be
slight
pleasure
of
intercourse
in
towns
where
the
youths
of
the
best
families
follow
the
foreigner
with
cries
of
goot
neeght
awe
right
broken
by
snickers
of
silly
laughter
and
where
dreams
of
long
hours
in
something
resembling
a
bed
are
rudely
dispelled
by
the
din
of
the
whistles
of
lonesome
policemen
and
all
the
thousand
and
one
noises
with
which
the
can
make
life
hideous
in
the
matter
of
libraries
and
peru
is
even
less
advanced
than
the
countries
to
the
north
there
was
to
be
sure
a
department
library
in
cajamarca
but
for
the
present
it
was
closed
in
despair
i
canvassed
the
town
for
a
book
a
clerk
whom
i
asked
why
no
printed
matter
was
to
be
had
replied
no
hay
aficionados
á
la
lectura
en
estas
partes
amateurs
of
reading
indeed
as
one
might
say
aficionados
of
billiards
fans
of
merely
an
amusing
game
to
pass
the
time
but
what
on
earth
do
people
do
with
their
minds
i
gasped
they
go
to
church
señor
replied
the
clerk
but
the
best
of
cajamarca
is
her
wonderful
green
and
checkered
valley
as
seen
from
the
rocky
hillock
ten
minutes
above
the
main
plaza
now
serving
as
a
quarry
of
soft
whitish
stone
but
on
which
if
anywhere
must
have
been
the
fortress
historians
tell
us
overlooked
the
inca
city
there
is
indeed
the
remnants
of
a
and
adobe
building
on
the
summit
and
cajamarquinos
who
climb
there
to
enjoy
the
widespread
view
asserted
that
atahuallpa
used
to
watch
from
this
height
the
rising
and
setting
of
the
sun
prescott
might
almost
have
sat
on
the
rocky
hillock
in
person
when
he
wrote
the
valley
of
cajamarca
enamelled
with
all
the
beauties
of
cultivation
lay
unrolled
like
a
rich
and
variegated
carpet
of
verdure
in
strong
contrast
with
the
dark
forms
of
the
andes
that
rose
up
everywhere
about
it
the
vale
is
of
oval
shape
extending
about
five
leagues
in
length
by
three
in
breadth
and
was
inhabited
by
a
superior
population
to
any
the
spaniards
had
yet
seen
with
ten
thousand
houses
of
clay
hardened
in
the
sun
and
some
ambitious
dwellings
of
hewn
the
valley
stretching
away
is
not
so
extensive
as
the
reading
of
prescott
leads
the
imagination
to
picture
except
in
one
place
where
it
spreads
out
like
the
arms
of
a
cross
it
is
surely
not
more
than
a
league
in
width
but
the
suave
spring
view
across
it
green
with
the
deep
green
of
the
cactus
and
clumped
now
by
the
australian
eucalyptus
in
contrast
to
the
treeless
days
of
the
incas
is
in
certain
moods
and
aspects
the
most
beautiful
of
the
andes
though
lacking
the
surrounding
snowclads
that
add
so
much
to
the
vale
of
quito
here
i
came
often
to
sit
above
the
murmur
of
the
town
until
the
god
of
the
incas
after
his
daily
journey
around
the
earth
to
see
that
all
was
well
sank
behind
the
broad
páramo
of
yanacancha
blotting
out
the
valley
stretching
away
to
the
southward
where
the
trail
following
the
old
inca
highway
down
the
backbone
of
the
continent
was
already
beckoning
me
on
chapter
xi
drawbacks
of
the
trail
tramping
down
the
andes
is
like
walking
on
the
ridge
of
a
steep
roof
there
is
a
constant
tendency
to
slip
off
on
one
side
or
the
other
and
slide
down
to
the
pacific
or
the
amazon
the
is
only
too
prone
to
follow
the
line
of
least
resistance
and
that
line
is
along
the
crest
of
the
andes
where
the
more
manly
incas
traveled
the
villager
obliged
to
journey
to
another
town
of
the
sierra
a
hundred
miles
north
or
south
will
ride
muleback
something
more
than
that
to
the
nearest
port
take
ship
to
another
harbor
and
ride
another
hundred
miles
up
into
the
interior
to
his
destination
hence
the
excellent
highway
that
might
have
been
built
down
all
the
backbone
of
the
continent
or
at
least
the
inca
one
that
might
have
been
kept
up
does
not
exist
each
community
is
confined
to
its
own
valley
and
cut
off
from
the
rest
by
almost
untrodden
mountain
ranges
or
by
trackless
bare
ridges
where
only
sheep
and
their
hardy
shepherds
can
live
under
the
beneficent
rule
of
the
incas
means
of
intercommunication
were
infinitely
better
than
then
roads
and
bridges
were
kept
in
constant
repair
and
in
all
exposed
parts
at
intervals
along
the
cold
punas
and
among
the
mountain
gorges
were
government
with
shelter
and
food
for
both
man
and
llamas
to
journey
from
cajamarca
to
lima
would
have
been
easy
i
had
only
to
hire
a
mule
to
pacasmayo
and
catch
a
passing
steamer
but
to
reach
there
by
the
route
i
had
proposed
to
myself
was
another
matter
even
raimondi
s
famous
map
of
peru
in
folios
over
which
i
spent
a
morning
in
the
prefect
s
parlor
offered
scanty
information
a
few
faint
lines
representing
trails
leading
almost
anywhere
except
where
i
would
go
the
only
route
at
all
suited
to
my
purpose
seemed
to
be
one
through
huamachuco
and
huraraz
and
along
the
valley
of
the
santa
river
near
the
source
of
this
it
looked
as
if
i
must
turn
back
almost
due
north
and
climb
over
the
uninhabited
snowclad
cordillera
central
whence
it
might
be
possible
to
reach
cerro
de
pasco
local
information
was
not
even
equal
to
the
assertion
of
had
never
been
nearer
south
america
than
the
southern
coast
of
the
messengers
of
pizarro
from
caxamalca
to
cuzco
followed
the
elevated
regions
of
the
cordillera
through
many
populous
towns
of
which
the
chief
were
guamachuco
guánuco
and
at
best
i
had
to
leave
the
scene
of
atahuallpa
s
undoing
with
little
knowledge
of
where
i
was
going
except
southward
certain
preparations
were
essential
before
i
plunged
again
into
the
all
but
unknown
the
trip
from
longest
sustained
hardship
i
had
ever
left
me
a
sadly
depleted
wardrobe
especially
were
my
in
the
last
stages
the
shops
of
cajamarca
had
no
heavy
ones
among
their
stock
but
i
had
hoped
with
the
assistance
of
the
prefect
to
buy
a
pair
of
the
shoes
manufactured
for
the
use
of
the
the
department
chief
however
put
off
wiring
the
president
or
laying
the
matter
before
congress
until
it
was
too
late
a
friendly
shoemaker
advised
me
to
apply
privately
to
a
soldier
or
policeman
but
they
have
only
one
pair
each
i
protested
true
replied
the
zapatero
pero
se
roban
entre
steal
from
each
this
hint
also
had
been
too
long
delayed
and
i
was
forced
to
trust
to
native
patching
to
carry
me
over
the
indefinite
region
to
the
next
source
of
supply
as
to
socks
i
had
found
that
the
best
for
tramping
the
andes
were
none
at
all
that
is
a
better
substitute
were
the
fusslappen
of
the
german
soldier
square
of
cotton
flannel
on
which
to
set
the
foot
diagonally
fold
over
the
three
corners
and
thrust
it
into
the
boot
the
small
silver
pieces
that
came
to
me
each
time
i
threw
down
a
sovereign
on
the
chinaman
s
counter
i
had
laid
away
for
the
road
ahead
spending
the
heavy
coppers
and
the
cartwheel
this
petty
point
is
extremely
important
in
the
andes
for
even
the
man
able
and
willing
to
toss
out
gold
for
every
banana
he
buys
often
finds
villages
of
the
sierra
where
the
yellow
metal
will
not
be
accepted
and
those
who
might
otherwise
be
willing
to
change
a
large
coin
are
frequently
afraid
to
show
that
they
have
so
much
money
on
hand
the
rucksack
style
of
carrying
had
proved
burdensome
for
the
load
that
remained
i
made
a
leather
harness
not
unlike
suspenders
with
half
my
possessions
balanced
against
the
rest
then
having
squandered
cents
in
the
greatest
banquet
known
to
the
chinaman
s
back
room
i
climbed
the
fortress
hill
to
watch
for
the
last
time
the
interwoven
colors
of
the
setting
sun
across
the
rich
vale
of
cajamarca
it
was
the
seventh
of
may
when
i
struck
southward
again
along
the
valley
floor
a
wide
highway
sidestepped
out
of
the
city
but
barely
had
the
scent
of
this
been
left
behind
than
a
shallow
river
took
possession
of
the
entire
width
of
the
road
there
is
a
sort
of
lawlessness
both
of
man
and
nature
in
the
andes
and
many
is
the
hacendado
who
thus
calmly
makes
use
of
the
public
highway
as
his
irrigation
ditch
when
hernando
de
soto
was
sent
with
fifteen
horse
to
visit
the
inca
at
his
baths
a
few
miles
south
of
the
city
they
followed
a
fine
causeway
across
the
plain
and
came
to
a
small
stream
with
a
bridge
but
distrusting
its
strength
dashed
through
the
an
hour
from
town
i
too
was
dashing
through
the
water
boots
in
hand
not
because
i
distrusted
the
bridge
but
because
there
was
not
the
vestige
of
a
bridge
left
to
distrust
beyond
the
stream
were
the
famous
baños
del
inca
now
owned
by
the
city
of
cajamarca
in
the
barnyard
of
a
stone
and
adobe
hacienda
a
chola
woman
sent
an
indian
boy
to
open
for
me
an
adjoining
room
in
the
floor
of
which
was
a
nearly
ten
feet
square
into
this
steaming
sulphurous
water
was
pouring
but
as
a
group
of
indians
were
washing
themselves
and
their
rags
in
the
source
of
supply
outside
i
was
forced
to
relinquish
the
rare
pleasure
of
a
hot
bath
even
in
so
famous
a
setting
historians
report
the
existence
of
an
ancient
stone
bathtub
that
was
used
by
the
incas
but
the
woman
was
certain
there
had
been
none
in
the
vicinity
during
her
career
as
caretaker
the
road
she
pointed
out
emerged
from
the
back
gate
of
the
hacienda
and
mounted
the
steaming
brook
higher
up
where
i
thrust
a
hand
in
it
the
water
was
just
hot
enough
to
be
bearable
the
valley
of
cajamarca
stretching
far
southward
had
promised
level
going
for
a
day
or
two
but
though
there
was
plenty
of
space
for
it
on
the
valley
floor
the
camino
real
true
to
its
andean
environment
preferred
to
clamber
up
and
down
over
stony
barren
broken
ridges
before
noon
it
had
raised
me
to
a
páramo
where
several
cold
blue
lakes
swarmed
with
wild
ducks
that
were
not
even
an
indian
i
fell
in
with
said
they
were
never
hunted
because
when
they
fall
there
is
no
way
to
enter
the
water
and
get
evidently
like
his
forebears
of
centuries
ago
he
had
never
heard
of
a
strange
invention
called

remaining

over
appalling

the
place
of
the

times

thirsty
despite
the
frequent
fording
of
streams
gray
with
decomposed

brought
me
to
san

in
a
tropical
and
fruitful
valley
withered
by
a
long
drought
on
the
façade
of
the
little
drygoods
shop
and
government
of
the
absent

hung
a
huge
sign
beginning
socorro

implying
that
the
owner
was
also
a
hooker
of
workmen
for
a
sugar
estate
down
on
the
coast
when
i
presented
my
order
from
the
prefect
of
the
department
the
wife
of
san

chief
authority
ordered
her
cholas
to
prepare
me
dinner
at
once
i
did
not
come
to
the
gobernador
that
he
should
personally
furnish
me
accommodations
i
protested
i
only
want
him
to
use
his
authority
with
those
who
make
a
business
of
lodging
there
is
no
such
place
in
san

replied
the
woman
locking
up
shop
and
leading
me
into
her
parlor
musty
with
disuse
but
all
travelers
are
welcome
behind
the
divan
to
which
she
motioned
me
stood
a
figure
of
the
virgin
flanked
by
another
of
saint
somebody
in
honor
of
the
arrival
of
a
stranger
perhaps
the
matron
soon
reappeared
with
several
and
stripping
the
madre
de
diós
to
her
nudity
reattired
her
in
four
gowns
each
of
which
was
far
more
costly
than
those
worn
by
any
of
the
living
beings
present
then
she
set
a
newly
polished
crown
on
the
head
of
the
image
and
falling
on
her
knees
before
it
began
to
rock
back
and
forth
imploring
her
intercession
in
a
monotonous
singsong
with
dusk
appeared
the
gobernador
accompanied
by
two
traveling
salesmen
and
having
ordered
the
three
mules
picketed
he
spent
a
long
evening
bewailing
with
them
the
rising
cost
of
commodities
of
first
necessity
even
our
very
aguardiente
and
pisco
in
the
act
of
looking
over
my
papers
his
eye
was
caught
by
a
typewritten
document
in
english
ah
los
yanquis
he
cried
they
are
so
they
even
avoid
the
labor
of
writing
by
having
their
letters
printed
but
how
can
they
afford
it

explained
a
he
gasped
is
there
such
a
thing
i
must
have
one
at
once
for
i
never
spell
things
the
village
church
having
lost
its
roof
most
of
the
old
women
in
town
gathered
with
my
hostess
in
the
adjoining
parlor
and
droned
for
hours
before
her
bamboo
saints
for
a
long
time
the
gobernador
gave
no
heed
to
the
uproar
though
it
forced
him
to
raise
his
voice
almost
to
a
shout
then
suddenly
he
broke
off
an
enumeration
of
prices
with
an
angry
hágame
el
favor
in
the
andes
the
expression
corresponds
closely
to
our
colloquial
what
do
you
know
about
that
por
diós
those
beatas
would
pray
a
man
insane
and
dashing
into
the
parlor
he
broke
up
the
meeting
forthwith
and
sent
the
women
scurrying
out
through
the
zaguan
like
startled
crows
for
all
her
religious
duties
my
hostess
found
time
to
set
down
in
my
the
recipe
of
the
most
potent
beverage
that
has
come
down
from
the
inca
civilization
de
at
the
making
of
which
that
served
with
the
evening
meal
proved
her
an
adept
in
a
laborious
hand
and
with
a
wealth
of
misspelling
that
suggested
that
she
too
could
have
used
a
to
advantage
she
wrote
take
ripe
shelled
corn
cover
with
water
and
leave
a
week
or
more
until
the
kernels
have
sprouted
dry
in
the
sun
two
or
three
days
crush
to
a
mass
boil
and
place
when
cold
in
jars
full
adding
sugar
sufficient
to
cause
despite
her
piety
and
attitude
of
moorish
seclusion
she
entered
into
the
conversation
with
a
frankness
peculiar
to
the
latin
race
not
the
least
startling
of
her
naïve
questions
was
how
many
children
have
you
i
am
not
married
i
answered
of
course
you
are
not
married
she
replied
being
a
traveler
all
over
peru
and
the
outside
world
but
have
you
really
no
children
at
all
at
daybreak
the
gobernador
sent
a
boy
and
a
horse
to
set
me
all
but
spill
me
river
below
the
town
because
it
is
very
dangerous
to
wet
the
feet
in
the
ichocán
two
leagues
beyond
san
marcos
sits
high
and
cold
on
an
eminence
behind
it
the
trail
sloped
languidly
upward
then
pitched
headlong
down
through
a
stony
wilderness
inhabited
only
by
cactus
and
wild
asses
to
the
condebamba
river
its
lower
valley
of
a
relieving
contrast
to
the
dreary
arid
mountain
flanks
across
the
roaring
gorge
a
bridge
of
steel
cables
supported
by
railway
rails
has
taken
the
place
of
the
of
woven
willow
withes
of
inca
days
but
it
still
looked
frail
and
aërial
enough
swaying
high
above
the
racing
stream
that
would
quickly
have
swept
a
stumbling
traveler
through
hills
to
the
marañón
and
the
amazon
and
the
few
arrieros
who
follow
this
route
have
no
easy
task
in
driving
their
donkeys
across
it
a
hut
on
the
dreary
slope
of
the
further
bank
housed
the
guardian
of
the
bridge
a
skeleton
who
was
barely
able
to
crawl
after
an
unbroken
year
of
the
intermittent
fever
of
the
andes
that
lurks
in
all
such
sunken
valleys
as
that
of
the
condebamba
i
might
better
have
spent
the
night
on
the
hillside
beyond
than
to
have
tossed
it
through
on
the
hut
floor
swarming
with
some
species
of
insect
luckily
i
was
not
offered
the
first
bowl
of
chicha
before
i
found
the
guardian
s
female
companion
concocting
the
family
supply
for
her
method
was
little
less
disillusioning
than
that
of
the
jívaros
indians
when
it
had
been
boiled
in
a
huge
kettle
that
spent
its
days
of
disuse
as
a
for
the
family
curs
the
liquid
was
poured
off
into
a
long
shallow
tub
like
a
small
canoe
the
same
one
that
would
serve
another
purpose
on
squatted
on
the
ground
beside
it
the
woman
was
stirring
it
slowly
with
a
stick
she
had
caught
up
at
random
bit
by
bit
two
gaunt
and
mangy
curs
slunk
nearer
until
their
noses
all
but
touched
the
steaming
liquid
whereupon
the
woman
left
off
her
stirring
long
enough
to
rap
them
over
the
head
with
the
ladle
the
dogs
retreated
a
yard
or
two
with
cowardly
yelps
only
to
repeat
the
advance
over
and
over
again
the
chola
s
vigilance
it
turned
out
was
not
due
to
any
unwonted
sense
of
cleanliness
she
was
merely
bent
on
saving
the
animals
from
burning
themselves
as
soon
as
she
judged
the
liquid
cool
enough
she
gave
a
sign
and
the
curs
fell
upon
the
tub
and
greedily
lapped
up
the
scum
thus
saved
the
labor
of
skimming
it
the
female
crawled
to
her
feet
and
set
the
stuff
away
in
earthen
jars
to
ferment
one
barren
stony
ridge
after
another
in
pitiless
succession
carried
me
much
higher
before
the
following
noonday
my
course
now
lay
well
east
of
south
for
i
had
caught
the
swing
of
the
west
coast
of
south
america
one
last
mighty
surge
and
the
world
fell
away
before
me
disclosing
almost
within
shouting
distance
the
provincial
capital
of
cajabamba
but
it
is
a
good
rule
in
the
andes
never
to
sit
down
in
the
plaza
until
you
reach
the
town
between
me
and
the
day
s
goal
lay
hidden
one
of
those
mighty
holes
in
the
earth
that
mean
the
undoing
and
repetition
of
all
the
toil
that
has
gone
before
the
shadows
were
beginning
to
climb
the
eastern
wall
of
cajabamba
s
valley
before
i
reached
the
cobbles
of
the
street
that
had
swallowed
up
the
converging
trails
the
plump
young
subprefect
who
was
awaiting
me
in
state
upon
my
return
from
the
chinese
fonda
to
which
a
soldier
had
piloted
me
would
have
been
had
not
some
careless
ancestor
faintly
clouded
his
family
tree
and
given
a
quaint
kink
to
his
hair
he
returned
my
papers
with
a
regal
bow
and
bade
me
make
my
home
in
his
office
as
long
as
i
chose
to
honor
cajabamba
with
my
presence
the
bed
was
a
blanket
on
the
yielding
floor
but
i
had
twenty
soldiers
at
my
beck
and
call
and
what
mattered
it
if
each
time
i
would
make
my
toilet
i
must
go
to
jail
luckily
the
doors
and
gates
creaked
with
as
pompous
humility
and
dignified
alacrity
for
my
exit
as
to
admit
me
though
there
were
those
within
who
had
not
passed
them
in
twenty
years
by
the
time
i
was
the
subprefect
pomaded
and
within
an
inch
of
his
life
fluttered
into
my
boudoir
to
ask
in
breathless
oratorical
periods
if
inasmuch
as
he
had
just
been
married
last
week
or
during
the
night
and
mother
down
on
the
coast
was
dying
to
know
what
the
new
acquisition
looked
like
and
there
were
no
photographers
in
cajabamba
and
it
was
a
pity
peru
was
so
backward
would
i
not
have
the
fineza
to
take
fifteen
or
twenty
pictures
of
him
and
his
novia
and
deliver
a
few
dozen
finished
and
mounted
prints
for
him
and
her
and
their
relatives
and
friends
and
compadres
and
associates
within
an
hour
or
two
as
the
carelessness
of
my
american
agent
had
left
me
almost
filmless
this
was
neither
the
first
nor
the
last
time
i
was
put
to
the
unpleasant
necessity
of
faking
a
picture
to
have
refused
his
request
even
with
humble
apologies
and
laborious
explanations
would
have
been
to
win
the
of
cajabamba
s
ruler
and
all
his
dependents
had
it
not
resulted
in
the
trumping
up
of
some
transparent
excuse
to
turn
me
out
and
refuse
me
official
assistance
in
finding
other
lodgings
a
photographer
speaking
some
spanish
could
pick
up
much
silver
down
the
crest
of
the
andes
it
would
have
been
a
kindness
if
he
had
made
the
trip
a
few
days
ahead
of
me
to
be
sure
these
official
requests
were
always
useful
in
a
way
while
the
powdered
and
perfumed
authorities
were
puffing
themselves
up
to
the
requisite
pomposity
the
town
was
sure
to
gather
alongside
and
as
neither
the
fancied
nor
the
real
subjects
were
well
enough
versed
in
mechanics
to
know
whether
a
kodak
operates
endwise
or
sidewise
i
caught
many
a
nonchalant
pose
of
some
really
worthwhile
bystander
that
i
might
have
begged
for
in
vain
on
this
occasion
the
novia
having
spent
a
few
hours
in
completely
disguising
herself
as
women
will
under
the
circumstances
the
world
over
appeared
at
last
deathly
pale
with
rice
powder
and
the
pair
assumed
a
score
of
fetching
poses
under
my
direction
true
it
was
dark
by
that
time
but
the
subprefect
saw
no
reason
why
a
photograph
should
not
be
taken
by
the
light
of
three
sputtering
candles
he
preferred
it
indeed
to
embracing
his
treasure
in
the
public
glare
of
day
but
the
night
had
grown
aged
before
he
feigned
to
understand
the
impossibility
of
immediate
delivery
and
he
accepted
only
sulkily
my
promise
to
send
the
finished
portraits
back
from
the
next
city
if
they
turned
out
during
my
morning
stroll
about
town
i
was
accosted
in
english
from
the
zaguan
of
a
building
of
dilapidated
adobe
splendor
so
often
had
i
heard
a
laborious
goot
mawnin
seer
how
dō
yō
dō
from
some
silly
youth
whose
knowledge
of
foreign
tongues
began
and
ended
with
that
phrase
that
i
nodded
and
passed
on
i
have
too
much
affection
for
my
mother
tongue
to
hear
it
gratuitously
maltreated
moreover
it
had
lain
so
long
idle
that
to
speak
it
had
come
to
seem
an
affectation
this
time
however
the
speaker
continued
with
faultless
fluency
i
hear
you
are
an
just
i
am
carlos
traverso
at
your
service
graduate
of
an
american
which
one
indeed
so
am
válgame

gasped
the
youth
betrayed
by
astonishment
into
his
native
tongue
for
a
moment
can
t
you
come
around
to
my
room
your
own
house
as
i
should
say
in
peru
you
probably
haven
t
seen
the
latest
copy
of
the
alumnus
nor
the
twenty
latest
ones
with
the
greatest
of
in
spite
of
myself
i
found
my
tongue
translating
the
set
castilian
phrases
i
had
so
long
been
using
instead
of
falling
into
the
colloquialisms
of
my
own
land
when
i
was
ensconced
in
an
american
armchair
battered
with
the
evidence
of
a
long
journey
and
of
the
crude
unloading
facilities
of
west
coast
ports
surrounded
by
walls
hidden
under
banners
and
photographs
that
seemed
to
turn
the
adobe
chamber
into
a
college
dormitory
transported
to
the
wilds
of
the
andes
the
youth
went
on
the
government
of
peru
gives
four
that
is
sends
yearly
an
honor
student
to
each
of
four
american
universities
with
an
allowance
of
a
hundred
dollars
a
month
that
is
you
had
for
the
course
at
michigan
yes
with
traveling
expenses
you
probably
had
about
the
same
allowance
fortunately
not
or
i
should
long
since
have
been
gracing
some
home
for
inebriates
and
is
this
just
a
present
from
the
government
no
on
our
return
we
must
serve
the
government
for
three
years
at
the
same
salary
i
am
superintendent
of
schools
in
this
and
the
neighboring
province
of
the
son
of
a
scandinavian
father
traverso
had
evidently
overcome
the
handicap
of
an
allowance
the
spending
of
which
would
have

the

leans
decidedly
to
the
west
whence
the
next
day
was
largely
one
of
mounting
but
the
region
is
so
high
that
climbing
was
not
laborious
in
the
invigorating
mountain
air
that
cuts
into
the
lungs
like
strong
wine
and
even
a
man
inclined
to
that
frailty
could
not
have
felt
lonely
with
so
much
of
the
world
spread
out
in
plain
sight
about
him
there
were
few
long
spaces
without
houses
or
once
i
fell
in
with
a
government
chasqui
driving
a
horse
and
an
ass
laden
with
sacks
of
mail
among
which
stood
out
one
marked
conspicuously
u
mail
the
correspondence
he
assured
me
was
not
bound
for
the
exterior
but
was
merely
local
matter
between
towns
of
the
route
that
had
been
farmed
out
to
him
a
statement
that
was
confirmed
at
the
next
a
mighty
crack
in
the
earth
into
and
out
of
which
the
trail
zigzagged
like
some
badly
wounded
creature
marked
my
exit
at
last
from
the
department
of
cajamarca
into
that
of
libertad
the
ancient
inca
highway
is
said
to
have
followed
this
same
route
over
these
high
undulating
plains
but
there
were
no
certain
vestiges
of
it
in
the
late
afternoon
i
burst
suddenly
out
upon
a
broad
view
of
the
famous
old
city
of
huamachuco
much
like
quito
in
setting
though
more
dreary
backed
by
a
ragged
black
range
half
cut
off
by
a
nearer
slope
that
might
have
been
pichincha
itself
the
two
peaks
streaked
with
the
first
snow
i
had
seen
since
leaving
central
ecuador
traverso
had
given
me
a
note
of
introduction
to
his
compadre

only
physician

hard
days

in
any
direction

at
salary
of
a
month
exceeding
even
that
of
the
haughty
subprefect
the
son
of
a
hamlet
far
up
in
the
hills
he
was
a
plain
earnest
little
man
with
a
heart
several
times
larger
than
the
average
of
his
from
his
lips
the
stereotyped
here
you
are
in
your
own
house
had
real
meaning
his
library
included
spanish
editions
of
taine
nietzsche
roosevelt
his
phonograph
was
of
high
grade
and
his
records
well
chosen
edison
was
his
ideal
of
a
straw
vote
in
the
andes
would
certainly
show
the
wizard
of
orange
the
most
popular
he
was
wont
to
boast
jokingly
that
his
own
name
was
the
same
as
one
of
those
of
the
inventor
showing
that
some
of
our
ancestors
were
the
toward
the
end
of
my
stay
i
discovered
that
the
doctor
having
installed
me
in
his
was
himself
huddling
out
the
cold
nights
on
a
bag
of
straw
and
a
wooden
table
in
the
mud
den
behind
his
it
was
not
until
we
had
grown
rather
well
acquainted
that
alva
confided
to
me
the
fact
that
he
had
worked
his
way
through
the
medical
school
of
lima
even
acting
as
waiter
señor
in
a
fonda
and
working
in
the
summer
like
any
peon
but
don
t
whisper
a
word
of
this
to
anyone
in
peru
he
implored
as
if
he
suddenly
regretted
having
taken
me
into
his
confidence
up
in
my
country
those
of
us
who
did
that
are
inclined
to
boast
of
it
i
laughed
ah
sí
señor
i
know
he
answered
in
an
undertone
glancing
cautiously
about
him
i
know
even
tomás
edison
was
a
newsboy
but
if
huamachuco
ever
hears
of
it
i
shall
be

which
hernando

was
sent
soon
after
the

to
investigate
the
rumor
that
an

was
being
raised
to

this
could
be
said

the

not

coincide
with

the
effete
descendants
of
a
more
hardy
race
have
crawled
down
into
a
sheltering
valley
leaving
uninhabited
the
ancient
city
of
the
gentiles
on
the
mountain
above
a
local
editor
apparently
for
no
better
reason
than
the
pleasure
of
basking
in
a
gringo
smile
offered
to
serve
me
as
guide
a
stony
road
flanked
ever
higher
along
a
perpendicular
then
rose
and
fell
over
lofty
undulations
and
at
some
six
miles
from
the
modern
town
brought
us
to
the
first
ruins
far
below
across
a
deep
quebrada
lay
like
a
relief
map
the
great
rectangle
of
a
ruined
city
in
perfect
squares
the
roofless
stone
gables
standing
forth
in
fantastic
array
above
a
forest
of
low
trees
this
was
viracochapampa
or
plain
of
the
nobles
the
resident
city
at
the
time
of
the
conquest
through
its
broad
central
street
passed
the
great
inca
highway
from
quito
to
cuzco
but
that
was
the
least
important
part
of
ancient
huamachuco
here
on
the
barren
stood
in
olden
times
protecting
the
on
the
stony
plain
below
above
the
modern
town
are
still
to
be
found
remnants
of
the
or
stone
trough
by
which
the
ancient
race
brought
water
to
this
lofty
summit
by
some
system
that
has
been
lost
in
the
haze
of
time
about
us
as
we
advanced
rose
ruin
after
stone
ruin
of
what
had
evidently
been
an
elaborate
series
of
fortresses
these
spread
mile
upon
mile
across
the
rugged
undulating
tableland
some
densely
interwoven
with
brambles
and
impenetrable
thickets
all
surrounded
by
the
utter
silence
of
a
world
long
since
abandoned
by
man
and
brute
indeed
the
place
was
less
remarkable
for
its
construction
than
for
the
vast
extent
of
the
ruins
several
large
edifices
square
or
triangular
in
shape
were
built
of
huge
blocks
of
stone
still
in
the
same
form
in
which
they
might
have
been
found
as
mountain
boulders
and
unlike
the
fortress
of
ingapirca
nowhere
nicely
fitted
together
on
the
contrary
nearly
every
joint
was
filled
in
with
chips
of
stone
and
in
the
thick
interior
walls
had
been
used
a
sort
of
crude
concrete
now
mere
gravelly
mud
that
could
be
picked
out
with
the
fingers
whether
was
built
by
an
earlier
people
or
by
a
more
careless
tribe
of
the
race
that
left
behind
the
palaces
of
cuzco
their
method
of
construction
did
not
make
for
durability
the
ruins
were
all
serrated
and
with
only
here
and
there
a
jagged
point
suggesting
the
original
height
the
whole
cutting
the
horizon
with
a
fantastic
broken
an
enormous
wall
had
evidently
once
surrounded
the
entire
peak
and
beyond
set
close
together
was
a
series
of
almost
round
fortresses
each
of
three
stone
walls
one
inside
the
other
one
more
carefully
constructed
edifice
gave
evidence
of
having
been
the
chief
palace
and
from
it
stretched
an
unobstructed
view
of
all
the
surrounding
landscape
in
which
an
advancing
enemy
might
have
been
sighted
league
upon
league
away
in
any
direction
it
was
in
huamachuco
that
the
first
hint
of
what
later
proved
to
be
amœbic
dysentery
overtook
me
recalling
to
memory
the
i
had
abandoned
in
cuenca
as
a
useless
burden
a
disturbing
lack
of
energy
settled
upon
me
my
appetite
startling
symptom
i
felt
as
if
i
had
inadvertently
swallowed
one
of
the
largest
ruins
of
it
was
with
no
rousing
pleasure
therefore
that
i
set
off
laden
with
eggs
and
a
supply
of
the
stony
local
bread
on
the
lonely
tramp
that
intervenes
between
the
residence
of
alva
and
the
next
town
four
leagues
south
the
road
swung
to
the
right
and
wading
the
shallow
huamachuco
river
i
struck
off
for
trujillo
and
comparative
civilization
on
the
coast
the
faint
path
to
the
left
bore
me
even
higher
across
an
uninhabited
world
dreary
with
its
endless
expanse
of
ichu
here
were
distinct
remnants
of
the
old
inca
highway
for
several
miles
across
the
undulating
páramo
the
way
lay
between
two
rows
of
stones
set
upright
a
considerable
distance
apart
and
enclosing
a
space
wide
enough
for
six
or
seven
carriages
had
they
existed
to
pass
abreast
if
as
the
inhabitants
of
the
region
assert
this
is
a
good
example
of
that
great
military
highway
of
the
incas
the
descriptions
of
chroniclers
and
historians
have
far
outdone
the
reality
gomara
reports
it
feet
wide
cut
in
a
straight
line
from
the
living
rock
or
made
of
stone
and
lime
turning
aside
neither
for
mountains
nor
prescott
speaks
of
highways
carefully
constructed
of
cut
slabs
of
freestone
and
porphyry
which
only
proves
how
incompetent
to
judge
things
south
american
is
the
most
competent
man
who
has
not
been
there
in
person
those
who
have
visited
spain
know
how
easily
the
title
camino
is
granted
and
the
conquistadores
like
the
peruvians
of
having
in
many
cases
probably
never
seen
a
real
road
had
no
means
of
comparison
certainly
this
inca
highway
had
nothing
to
justify
the
extravagant
praise
of
those
who
compared
it
to
the
old
roman
roads
the
most
that
had
been
done
in
the
way
of
road
building
was
to
clear
the
plain
of
loose
conspicuous
contrast
to
the
modern
peruvians
who
look
upon
a
road
as
a
convenient
place
to
toss
the
stones
picked
up
in
their
fields
here
and
there
along
the
andes
mark
forever
the
routes
of
travel
of
inca
days
but
they
are
chiefly
piles
thrown
up
by
travelers
who
tossed
upon
them
as
votary
offering
a
cud
of
coca
of
the
maintained
at
frequent
intervals
by
the
imperial
government
like
the
of
india
not
even
the
ruins
of
one
in
a
hundred
remain
standing
and
the
traveler
of
is
far
more
exposed
to
the
elements
than
in
the
times
of
the
incas
the
andes
rise
ever
higher
from
north
to
south
and
from
west
to
east
whence
i
was
far
above
huamachuco
when
i
dragged
myself
into
the
vaquería
angasmarca
a
cluster
of
cobblestone
hovels
barely
four
feet
high
home
of
an
indian
in
one
of
the
most
dreary
stony
settings
in
south
america
unable
to
get
even
hot
water
i
dared
not
eat
the
heavy
i
carried
i
had
huddled
for
hours
on
a
stone
under
the
projecting
roof
when
after
dark
the
himself
rode
in
from
huamachuco
having
been
a
soldier
trained
to
a
bit
less
immobility
of
temperament
than
his
mate
he
was
partly
cajoled
partly
deceived
into
ordering
her
to
serve
me
a
gourdful
of
potato
soup
prepared
under
circumstances
better
imagined
than
described
for
a
long
time
he
replied
with
dogged
apathetic
persistence
that
he
only
gave
posado
in
the
corredor
but
i
succeeded
at
last
in
inducing
him
to
furnish
me
a
ragged
blanket
in
a
corner
of
his
own
sty
on
the
earth
floor
of
which
huddled
the
entire
family
and
the
customary
menagerie
of
small
animals
the
traveler
who
crawls
out
blue
with
cold
after
a
night
in
one
of
these
cobble
caves
of
the
highland
indian
to
squat
against
the
eastern
wall
until
a
gourd
of
warm
water
savored
with
corn
and
the
over
which
it
is
slowly
is
thrust
out
at
him
no
longer
wonders
that
the
aboriginals
of
the
andes
worshipped
the
sun
every
step
of
that
day
of
excruciating
climbs
and
stony
descents
across
dreary
páramos
on
which
i
several
times
lost
my
way
was
a
bitter
struggle
for
all
the
demands
of
the
will
my
legs
could
not
push
me
forward
two
miles
an
hour
and
ever
and
anon
they
seemed
to
turn
to
straw
and
dropped
me
suddenly
to
the
ground
all
the
visible
world
lay
high
and
treeless
now
with
touches
of
snow
on
several
black
peaks
of
the
cordillera
to
the
eastward
during
the
day
i
had
passed
several
more
remnants
of
the
old
inca
highway
two
continuous
lines
of
upright
stones
set
far
apart
on
either
side
of
a
space
a
full
wide
toward
sunset
the
trail
began
to
descend
into
a
stony
far
down
which
i
made
out
a
tiled
building
among
eucalyptus
trees
a
passing
horseman
carelessly
answered
my
question
while
more
engrossed
in
my
appearance
by
assuring
me
it
was
the
hacienda
house
i
was
seeking
and
i
toiled
a
up
the
mountainside
to
it
only
to
have
the
solitary
indian
female
who
occupied
it
point
out
far
below
in
the
valley
of
the
river
the
patrón
s
house
of
the
hacienda
it
was
the
most
imposing
country
dwelling
i
had
yet
seen
in
peru
a
large
village
and
two
churches
clustered
about
it
the
entrance
like
that
to
some
rough
old
medieval
palace
the
swarms
of
dependents
carrying
the
mind
back
to
feudal
days
around
an
immense
flower
and
patio
in
which
indian
hostlers
were
struggling
to
unload
a
score
of
mules
and
horses
were
some
thirty
rooms
each
with
a
number
above
the
door
i
did
not
learn
whether
it
was
the
custom
of
the
owner
to
collect
hotel
charges
but
the
establishment
was
conducted
in
as
heartless
and
impersonal
a
manner
as
if
he
did
he
was
a
snarly
old
invalid
who
crawled
about
with
a
cane
growling
orders
to
his
cringing
indians
and
too
much
taken
up
with
his
own
infirmities
to
waste
sympathy
on
others
with
a
grunt
he
thrust
my
letter
of
introduction
into
a
pocket
ordering
an
indian
to
unlock
one
of
the
numbered
rooms
stagnant
with
the
atmosphere
of
a
cheap
hotel
it
contained
a
bed
with
leather
springs
a
billowy
mattress
and
a
sack
of
ichu
as
pillow
and
only
after
a
long
struggle
did
i
obtain
a
bowl
of
soup
filled
with
tough
beef
and
yuca
and
potatoes
a
dish
barely
endurable
to
a
strong
man
in
full
health
it
was
late
next
morning
before
infinite
patience
won
me
a
bowl
of
hot
milk
and
i
dragged
myself
away
almost
due
north
across
the
world
south
of
angasmarca
yawned
a
bottomless
valley
beyond
which
a
rocky
rose
to
the
very
heavens
the
road
which
should
have
followed
in
that
direction
was
left
to
sneak
out
like
some
hunted
thing
for
a
vast
detour
even
before
it
began
to
crawl
away
eastward
at
right
angles
to
the
way
i
would
have
gone
at
the
outset
was
a
laborious
stony
climb
from
the
summit
of
which
the
hacienda
tulpo
lay
in
plain
sight
but
across
one
of
those
heartbreaking
gashes
in
the
earth
so
frequent
in
the
andes
on
the
left
stood
sharp
stark
of
the
cordillera
which
seemed
to
grow
mightier
with
each
day
southward
noon
had
long
since
passed
yet
there
were
barely
eight
miles
behind
me
when
i
entered
the
general
store
of
an
hacienda
building
forming
a
hollow
square
around
a
dreary
barnyard
the
shopkeeper
announced
himself
the
owner
of
the
by
poetic
license
there
is
a
careful
graduation
of
caste
in
the
andes
that
makes
it
easy
for
the
experienced
traveler
to
set
any
man
s
place
in
the
local
society
this
fellow
s
dress
color
his
familiar
yet
commanding
manner
toward
the
indians
who
sneaked
in
all
that
saturday
afternoon
to
dawdle
about
the
counter
and
buy
bits
of
trash
draughts
of
native
anything
the
place
afforded
except
what
might
have
been
of
some
use
to
them
generally
on
credit
thus
lengthening
their
slavery
to
the
estate
all
gave
the
lie
to
his
assertion
but
for
all
his
posing
he
turned
out
a
kindly
fellow
he
not
only
sold
me
a
itself
a
great
kindness
in
the
dragged
down
from
a
shelf
a
sort
of
and
them
when
i
had
drunk
these
surrounded
by
a
solid
wall
of
indians
who
seemed
to
consider
the
feat
remarkable
i
still
could
not
bestir
myself
to
push
on
by
and
by
my
eyes
wandering
aimlessly
over
the
stock
that
covered
two
walls
to
the
ceiling
caught
sight
of
a
familiar
can
of
american
tomatoes
i
bought
them
at
sixty
cents
long
after
an
old
woman
had
carried
off
the
precious
empty
can
the
shopkeeper
spent
all
the
leisure
left
him
by
the
sluggish
flow
of
now
indians
in
thumbing
over
great
sheaves
of
foreign
bills
of
lading
and
at
length
handed
me
thirty
cents
with
the
announcement
that
he
had
inadvertently
charged
me
for
the
whole
shipment
two
cans
when
the
dreary
afternoon
had
at
last
dragged
its
leaden
way
into
the
past
tense
and
chill
sunset
was
creeping
across
this
lofty
world
i
mentioned
to
the
shopkeeper
that
i
needed
a
spot
on
which
to
spend
the
night
the
idea
evidently
had
never
occurred
to
him
the
estate
was
mine
and
all
the
wonders
for
all
that
two
more
endless
hours
passed
before
a
indian
led
me
to
an
icy
and
pointed
out
two
bare
on
the
earth
floor
certainly
that
man
is
a
fool
who
sets
out
on
a
trip
down
the
andes
for
pleasure
for
after
the
first
joys
of
roughing
it
have
worn
off
no
more
monotonously
pleasureless
existence
is
conceivable
there
is
to
be
sure
a
certain
feeling
of
exclusiveness
a
certain
satisfaction
in
living
through
hardships
of
moving
by
one
s
own
efforts
over
those
parts
of
the
earth
where
modern
means
of
transportation
are
unknown
but
even
this
soon
wears
off
and
with
the
dreary
sameness
of
each
day
the
journey
becomes
chiefly
a
waste
of
time
and
effort
and
a
disappointment
in
the
morning
i
crawled
away
along
a
world
growing
ever
higher
until
suddenly
it
fell
abruptly
into
a
chasm
anything
i
had
yet
seen
in
my
worst
nightmares
across
it
so
high
even
from
this
height
that
it
seemed
not
of
our
world
a
town
was
pitched
on
the
very
tip
of
a
gashed
and
haggard
range
fortunately
my
route
seemed
to
lead
off
down
the
valley
and
i
was
finding
some
grains
of
comfort
in
not
having
to
ascend
to
that
heavenly
of
man
whatever
it
might
be
called
when
a
passing
horseman
sapped
my
last
drop
of
ambition
by
telling
me
it
was
the
place
in
which
i
must
spend
the
night
a
long
time
had
passed
before
i
coaxed
myself
to
creep
slowly
on
avoiding
the
view
of
the
task
before
me
as
a
criminal
about
to
be
executed
might
shade
his
eyes
from
the
scaffold
an
unconscionable
distance
down
in
the
bottomless
intervening
valley
yet
still
high
i
met
the
first
foreign
tramp
i
had
yet
seen
on
the
road
in
south
america
he
was
an
austrian
of
fifty
looking
in
his
matted
lusterless
hair
and
beard
and
his
drooping
rags
like
a
corpse
that
had
arisen
for
a
stroll
gehen
sie
nicht
no
further
south
he
pleaded
weakly
there
everyone
is
dying
of
dysentery
turn
back
with
me
to
trujillo
and
his
illness
had
reached
that
stage
when
the
invalid
sees
the
leering
head
of
disease
rising
on
all
sides
and
fancies
he
may
run
away
from
what
he
carries
with
him
i
could
not
naturally
abandon
a
plan
of
years
standing
merely
because
of
a
temporary
disability
and
when
we
had
exchanged
some
bits
of
road
information
each
crawled
slowly
on
his
way
in
the
hamlet
of
mollepata
near
the
bottom
of
the
quebrada
an
old
woman
stirred
herself
to
brew
me
some
herb
tea
into
which
she
put
a
branch
of
wormwood
with
the
assurance
that
this
was
a
quick
and
certain
cure
for
my
ailment
the
descent
had
been
bad
enough
the
climb
out
of
that
breathless
gash
in
the
earth
was
probably
the
most
dismal
experience
of
my
career
i
had
not
to
that
day
nor
do
i
expect
again
during
this
life
to
accomplish
a
more
bitter
task
than
that
struggle
in
intermittent
rain
under
my
leaden
load
and
poncho
from
the
or
across
the
river
forming
the
northern
boundary
of
the
department
of
ancachs
to
pallasca
to
make
matters
worse
the
natives
were
united
in
the
assertion
that
the
source
of
my
trouble
was
my
habit
of
drinking
at
streams
along
the
way
that
at
this
altitude
the
water
was
not
only
too
cold
but
held
in
solution
many
minerals
that
made
it
unsafe
long
afterward
i
had
reason
to
believe
that
this
had
little
to
do
with
the
matter
but
ready
at
the
time
to
grasp
at
any
straw
i
threw
away
the
that
had
served
me
as
drinking
vessel
resolved
that
not
another
drop
of
raw
water
should
pass
my
at
least
my
throat
the
resolution
called
for
every
ounce
of
one
of
the
chief
pleasures
of
a
walking
trip
had
always
been
to
quench
my
thirst
whenever
opportunity
offered
now
the
mountain
rivulets
that
babbled
down
across
my
trail
were
tantalizing
beyond
belief
and
i
would
gladly
have
given
a
gold
long
as
they
have
been
able
to
drink
my
fill
at
each
with
impunity
worst
of
all
there
were
no
substitutes
for
water
to
be
had
neither
fruits
prepared
drinks
nor
any
other
relief
from
torture
on
the
day
we
sailed
from
panama
a
zone
doctor
had
warned
hays
and
me
as
the
first
and
primary
rule
of
the
journey
before
us
always
to
boil
our
water
he
little
guessed
the
difficulty
not
to
say
impossibility
of
obeying
that
apparently
simple
commandment
in
the
andes
black
night
had
long
since
fallen
when
i
dragged
myself
into
the
central
plaza
of
pallasca
silent
and
dark
except
in
the
densely
packed
church
a
dimly
illuminated
shop
on
a
far
corner
proved
to
be
a
tavern
my
thirst
had
reached
the
point
where
drink
was
imperative
though
the
sentence
were
sudden
death
i
ran
my
eye
over
the
shelves
there
is
wheesky
cuzqueños
wheedled
the
keeper
and
rhum
jamaïca
or
french
absinthe
or
have
you
anything
i
croaked
cómo
no
señor
there
is
wine
and
beer
from
lima
in
south
america
anything
short
of
alcohol
does
not
count
as
such
even
the
law
does
not
rate
beer
and
wine
alcoholic
there
being
nothing
better
i
pointed
out
a
bottle
bearing
the
stamp
of
a
lima
brewery
the
sentence
was
not
exactly
sudden
death
but
that
may
be
because
i
had
grown
calloused
to
similar
hardships
this
peruvian
imitation
of
a
german
dark
beer
was
thick
and
black
as
crude
molasses
bitter
as
cascarilla
bark
and
more
nauseating
than
medicine
with
only
the
edge
of
my
thirst
blunted
i
forced
the
rest
of
the
bottle
upon
a
bystander
not
maliciously
but
because
i
knew
that
a
lifetime
in
the
andes
had
hardened
him
to
anything
and
turned
to
the
question
of
lodging
you
come
right
along
with
me
cried
the
grateful
bystander
smacking
his
lips
you
will
stop
with
the
señor
cura
like
all
travelers
of
but
the
señor
cura
was
in
no
condition
to
receive
guests
in
his
large
parlor
around
the
corner
the
padre
lay
on
a
couch
the
slouch
hat
over
his
head
and
a
lack
of
shave
giving
him
a
startling
resemblance
to
the
spanish
bandits
of
operatic
fancy
no
compadre
i
am
sick
and
i
can
not
give
lodging
he
replied
to
every
plea
of
my
officious
sponsor
the
several
persons
in
the
room
entered
into
a
whispered
conference
some
time
later
i
was
aroused
from
my
lethargy
and
my
cicerone
and
a
youth
led
the
way
across
the
black
plaza
and
up
a
steep
cobbled
street
which
my
legs
all
but
refused
to
navigate
under
my
heavy
though
he
would
not
leave
a
man
who
had
treated
him
to
the
luxury
of
a
glass
of
beer
from
the
capital
at
a
fabulous
price
until
he
had
seen
him
safely
housed
neither
the
bystander
nor
his
companion
could
sink
their
caste
to
the
depth
of
carrying
a
bundle
in
the
public
street
even
on
a
dark
night
when
morning
dawned
i
found
myself
rolled
up
in
a
heap
of
blankets
on
the
earth
floor
of
a
parlor
hours
passed
without
a
human
being
appearing
i
pulled
myself
together
and
shuffled
out
into
the
patio
of
an
immense
dilapidated
house
at
the
tiptop
of
the
town
overlooking
half
a
world
and
swept
by
all
the
winds
of
heaven
pallasca
has
been
likened
to
so
like
a
pair
of
saddlebags
on
the
rump
of
a
does
it
hang
down
the
two
sides
of
a
lofty
nose
of
the
range
across
the
void
in
spite
of
the
penetrating
glare
of
the
andean
sunshine
the
cordillera
had
tumbled
her
mountains
recklessly
in
a
tumultuous
heap
as
if
the
builder
of
the
world
had
left
here
his
surplus
of
materials
the
andes
have
little
of
the
color
and
varied
charm
of
the
alps
but
in
awesome
grandeur
and
repulsive
savage
mightiness
they
dwarf
the
latter
by
comparison
in
a
room
down
on
the
sunken
street
on
which
opened
the
patio
zaguan
the
youth
and
his
brother
kept
the
town
they
were
the
sons
of
a
german
who
had
married
in
peru
yet
only
their
more
robust
frames
and
greater
physical
virility
distinguished
them
from
the
common
run
of
natives
in
temperament
they
were
as
thoroughly
what
the
canal
zoner
calls
spig
as
the
most
enemic
of
their
the
older
was
an
amateur
the
accent
on
the
only
one
for
scores
of
miles
around
he
prepared
me
a
capsules
of
the
andean
bismuth
prescribed
a
diet
of
name
for
a
thin
cornmeal
might
be
substituted
by
chuño
inglés
a
liquid
wheat
or
rice
soup
and
assured
me
that
i
would
be
completely
recovered
in
the
morning
all
the
articles
of
diet
were
contingent
on
the
possibility
of
getting
the
ingredients
which
in
the
andes
is
a
distinct
contingency
for
thirst
i
was
advised
to
take
only
boiled
water
with
cinnamon
or
bark
but
even
to
get
the
former
cost
a
constant
struggle
with
the
apathetic
servants
and
the
necessity
of
dragging
myself
down
to
the
stream
on
a
corner
of
the
plaza
to
cool
the
boiling
pot
later
in
the
day
while
i
lay
contemplating
the
immense
distance
across
the
room
a
young
came
to
say
that
the
cura
wished
to
see
me
the
mere
novelty
of
a
man
of
the
cloth
desiring
my
presence
was
so
astonishing
that
it
lent
a
bit
of
stiffness
to
my
legs
i
rose
and
wandered
down
across
the
main
plaza
from
the
further
side
of
which
the
world
falls
precipitously
away
into
unfathomable
void
illustration
detail
of
the
ruins
of
high
up
on
the
mountain
above
the
modern
town
of
that
name
they
are
reputed
to
be
at
least
years
old
illustration
pallasca
to
which
i
climbed
from
one
of
the
mightiest
in
the
andes
sits
on
the
tiptop
of
the
world
and
falls
sheer
away
at
a
corner
of
its
plaza
into
a
fathomless
void
the
unshaven
papist
still
wore
his
slouch
hat
and
by
day
his
aspect
was
increased
by
a
complexion
like
unpolished
he
motioned
me
to
a
chair
beneath
the
lithograph
of
a
ravishing
nude
figure
advertising
a
foreign
brand
of
cigarettes
and
trusted
with
all
the
smoothness
of
which
the
spanish
tongue
is
capable
that
i
had
not
misunderstood
his
inhospitality
of
the
night
before
gradually
i
turned
the
conversation
to
the
history
of
his
native
region
he
had
made
a
serious
study
of
the
period
and
was
sure
that
the
indians
lived
in
just
such
unwashed
misery
under
the
incas
as
only
as
each
group
of
ten
had
its
commander
who
set
its
tasks
and
carried
his
investigations
into
the
very
bosom
of
the
family
they
were
not
then
so
unspeakably
lazy
i
had
started
to
take
my
leave
after
some
desultory
remarks
on
my
journey
during
which
he
desired
to
know
if
i
had
walked
all
the
way
from
europe
when
the
priest
remarked
before
going
you
will
allow
me
to
give
you
a
little
remembrance
cómo
no
gracias
i
answered
fancying
the
old
fellow
was
about
to
favor
me
with
a
tin
crucifix
or
a
bottle
of
holy
water
he
sat
up
slowly
and
pulling
open
a
drawer
of
his
massive
desk
took
out
five
silver
and
held
them
toward
me
mil
gracias
no
señor
i
cried
in
astonishment
them
as
a
memento
he
persisted
attempting
to
thrust
the
coins
into
my
pocket
plainly
he
regarded
my
refusal
a
mere
preliminary
formality
to
save
my
face
so
ingrained
is
the
notion
that
no
man
exerts
himself
physically
except
under
compulsion
that
for
all
my
explanations
he
still
cherished
the
idea
that
i
traveled
on
foot
because
i
had
not
the
means
to
travel
otherwise
nor
did
i
avoid
his
proposed
charity
without
a
great
waste
of
flowery
castilian
and
for
all
that
left
him
somewhat
offended
even
the
sons
of
the
misled
german
could
not
be
made
to
understand
why
i
had
refused
the
proposed
benefaction
andarines
of
the
peyrounel
variety
have
given
these
isolated
towns
of
the
andes
the
impression
that
all
foreigners
arriving
on
foot
were
living
on
the
tramps
in
our
sense
of
the
word
are
unknown
in
the
andes
the
few
foreign
who
reach
peru
rarely
get
beyond
lima
and
the
indians
still
cling
to
the
inca
they
may
no
longer
know
that
an
inca
ever
each
man
sticking
pertinaciously
to
his
own
birthplace
it
is
as
impossible
for
the
american
to
realize
the
absolute
lack
of
anything
approaching
wanderlust
in
the
andean
and
his
dread
of
moving
away
from
his
native
pueblo
as
it
is
for
the
indian
to
understand
why
the
american
is
so
far
from
home
even
among
the
more
or
less
educated
officials
i
could
not
shake
off
the
title
more
than
one
rural
authority
showed
himself
aggrieved
because
i
did
not
ask
for
his
testimonial
seal
and
signature
fancying
himself
slighted
as
of
too
little
importance
many
another
assured
the
gaping
bystanders
ah
ganan
un
platal
esa
fellows
win
a
wad
of
money
when
he
gets
back
his
government
will
give
him
a
great
prize
at
least
soles
for
the
trip
a
prize
indeed
as
if
there
were
not
a
prize
at
every
turn
of
the
winding
trail
in
every
new
vista
of
tumultuous
nature
under
the
clear
metallic
blue
of
the
highland
sky
i
determined
to
push
on
next
morning
for
pallasca
was
no
nearer
recovery
than
my
journey
s
end
the
diluted
germans
had
promised
to
have
an
indian
carrier
ready
at
dawn
but
they
were
true
peruvians
the
morning
was
half
gone
when
i
gave
up
in
disgust
and
set
out
alone
at
the
zaguan
however
a
indian
rose
to
his
feet
to
say
that
he
had
been
sent
by
the
gobernador
to
assist
me
and
i
piled
my
bundle
upon
him
forthwith
though
pallasca
seems
to
perch
on
the
very
summit
of
the
world
the
trail
managed
to
find
another
range
to
climb
scores
of
cold
streams
babbled
tantalizingly
across
my
path
a
cosmic
wilderness
of
gaunt
and
haggard
mountains
here
throwing
forward
bare
and
repulsive
outliers
there
weirdly
decorated
with
of
clouds
and
jutting
headlands
lay
tumbled
on
every
hand
as
far
as
the
eye
could
range
the
indian
chewed
coca
constantly
pausing
frequently
to
dip
a
bit
of
lime
from
the
gourd
he
carried
at
his
waist
and
appeared
to
have
as
little
energy
as
i
when
we
had
crawled
some
six
miles
and
a
scattered
hamlet
was
visible
about
as
far
ahead
with
a
deep
gash
of
the
earth
between
he
began
to
complain
of
pains
and
finally
lay
down
in
the
trail
i
did
not
regret
the
halt
but
when
i
had
waited
a
and
his
groans
still
sounded
i
sought
to
urge
him
on
it
was
useless
whether
he
was
really
sunday
may
have
left
him
with
what
is
technically
known
in
sporting
circles
as
a
was
merely
taking
this
means
of
shirking
an
unwelcome
task
now
we
were
far
enough
away
so
that
i
was
not
likely
to
return
to
complain
to
the
gobernador
arguments
and
threats
moved
him
exactly
as
they
would
have
the
rocks
on
which
he
writhed
consigning
him
to
the
nethermost
regions
i
struggled
to
my
feet
under
my
harness
and
staggered
on
down
the
stony
bajada
hours
afterward
utterly
exhausted
by
the
short
dozen
miles
i
entered
the
mud
hamlet
of
huandoval
expecting
a
miserable
night
on
the
earth
floor
of
some
icy
dungeon
hut
it
was
not
quite
so
bad
as
that
at
the
first
doorway
where
i
paused
to
inquire
for
the
gobernador
a
young
woman
of
unusual
andean
intelligence
offered
me
lodging
where
i
stood
the
den
was
as
dreary
as
usual
but
in
a
corner
stood
a
bare
slat
bedstead
under
an
immense
heap
of
potatoes
early
as
it
was
i
spread
my
poncho
and
lay
down
anticipating
a
welcome
to
discover
that
i
was
lodged
in
the
huandoval
telephone
exchange
on
the
wall
hung
an
aged
errickson
instrument
the
strange
vagaries
of
which
brought
the
chola
in
upon
me
as
often
as
its
jangle
sounded
the
place
too
like
telephone
exchanges
the
world
over
was
exceedingly
popular
with
the
young
men
of
the
town
and
when
my
rest
was
not
being
broken
by
some
mistaken
call
from
another
exchange
it
was
disrupted
by
the
labored
wit
of
some
rural
lothario
it
is
but
eight
miles
from
huandoval
to
cabana
capital
of
the
province
yet
it
required
nine
hours
of
the
most
concentrated
effort
both
mental
and
physical
to
drive
myself
over
the
low
barren
ridge
that
separates
the
two
towns
the
story
of
the
next
few
days
trivial
in
detail
i
give
in
no
spirit
of
complaint
but
merely
because
it
sheds
so
direct
a
light
on
the
character
of
the
andean
peruvian
i
had
learned
that
there
was
a
hospital
in
huaráz
the
department
capital
and
requested
the
subprefect
of
cabana
to
use
his
authority
to
help
me
hire
a
horse
as
he
was
in
duty
bound
to
do
by
the
official
orders
i
carried
pierda
cuidado
orated
the
thin
angular
fellow
peering
at
me
with
his
squint
the
government
will
furnish
you
a
horse
and
all
that
is
nobody
wanted
the
government
to
furnish
me
anything
but
i
did
not
stop
to
argue
the
matter
my
entire
attention
was
taken
up
just
then
with
resisting
the
efforts
of
the
authorities
to
throw
me
into
a
dank
mud
den
under
the
allegation
that
it
was
a
lodging
fortunately
there
was
some
one
else
than
peruvians
in
the
town
it
was
through
the
village
priest
that
i
won
at
last
a
room
above
the
prefectura
of
mud
floor
in
spite
of
its
elevation
supported
on
poles
that
yielded
to
the
tread
he
was
a
tall
basque
of
fifty
with
a
massive
roman
nose
and
in
memory
of
his
a
set
awry
on
his
head
and
matching
his
long
flowing
gown
only
in
color
he
had
suffered
from
the
same
ailment
during
his
first
year
in
this
foreign
land
and
was
sure
he
knew
an
instant
instead
of
merely
talking
about
it
like
a
native
he
sent
a
man
to
prepare
it
this
was
a
of
wine
boiled
with
the
bark
of
a
mountain
tree
called
the
but
whatever
effectiveness
it
might
have
possessed
was
offset
by
the
impossibility
of
keeping
to
a
proper
diet
or
even
of
getting
boiled
water
to
drink
there
was
no
doctor
in
cabana
yet
all
cabana
posed
as
physicians
now
some
fellow
would
drop
in
to
say
the
very
best
thing
you
can
eat
is
and
he
would
scarcely
be
out
of
sight
before
another
paused
to
assure
me
that
would
kill
me
within
an
hour
eat
the
whites
of
eggs
cried
another
you
can
eat
almost
anything
asserted
the
next
comer
except
the
whites
of
again
the
room
would
be
darkened
by
a
shadow
in
the
doorway
and
a
man
would
step
forward
to
say
now
here
is
an
old
indian
woman
from
up
in
the
mountains
whose
grandfather
s
nephew
died
of
dysentery
and
all
night
the
town
boomed
with
fireworks
the
howling
of
dogs
the
bawling
of
drunken
citizens
and
the
atrocious
uproar
of
a
local
band
for
it
was
the
eve
of
something
or
other
far
from
finding
the
promised
horse
waiting
for
me
at
dawn
i
did
not
see
the
shadow
of
a
person
until
after
ten
then
a
stupid
insolent
soldier
came
to
ask
if
i
wanted
at
twelve
he
had
not
returned
i
dragged
myself
down
to
the
plaza
the
subprefect
and
all
his
henchmen
were
making
merry
in
a
i
requested
him
to
have
some
one
prepare
me
food
at
any
price
price
they
were
horrified
of
course
they
could
not
think
of
letting
me
for
anything
i
was
the
guest
of
cabana
they
would
me
a
magnificent
meal
at
once
cried
the
subprefect
tying
himself
in
several
knots
in
his
excess
of
courtesy
what
would
i
like
roast
lamb
with
eggs
a
fine
steak
with
no
i
would
be
completely
satisfied
with
a
bowl
of
gruel
ah
certainly
i
should
have
it
at
once
and
a
basket
of
fruit
and
and
there
they
dropped
the
matter
until
the
priest
discovering
my
plight
well
on
in
the
afternoon
sent
up
a
dish
of
rice
gruel
everything
does
not
come
to
him
who
waits
in
the
andes
and
i
descended
again
to
mention
the
word
horse
to
the
now
reeling
subprefect
have
no
care
he
hiccoughed
the
government
will
attend
to
all
knowing
he
was
merely
showing
off
before
his
and
that
he
would
really
let
me
lie
where
i
was
or
at
most
furnish
me
some
crippled
rozinante
to
carry
me
to
tauca
three
miles
away
i
refused
his
putative
charity
he
turned
to
the
crowd
about
us
with
a
pretense
of
being
hurt
to
the
quick
then
sent
a
boy
to
summon
the
gobernador
likewise
maudlin
with
the
celebration
since
this
señor
has
declined
my
offer
to
furnish
him
all
that
is
needed
stuttered
the
offended
subprefect
you
will
have
a
horse
with
saddle
and
bridle
ready
for
but
why
not
i
protested
absurd
señor
is
the
great
corpus
cristi
procession
and
you
would
not
wish
to
miss
that
even
if
you
could
get
an
indian
to
go
with
the
procession
set
for
started
soon
after
my
return
to
my
room
from
the
altar
of
the
church
it
encircled
the
plaza
and
returned
whence
it
had
come
the
route
had
been
carefully
scraped
and
for
the
only
time
during
the
ragged
indians
forced
to
contribute
this
pious
labor
by
the
several
grades
of
authorities
howling
over
them
then
it
had
been
spread
with
a
long
strip
of
carpet
after
which
came
scores
of
barefoot
women
to
cover
it
with
a
fixed
design
of
of
all
colors
then
forth
from
the
mud
church
issued
the
basque
priest
in
vestments
his
boína
and
incessant
cigarette
gone
four
indians
protecting
him
from
the
dull
sunless
day
by
a
rich
canopy
proceeded
followed
or
surrounded
by
all
the
bareheaded
piety
of
cabana
the
distressing
band
blowing
itself
he
moved
slowly
forward
only
his
own
sacred
feet
touching
the
carpet
women
and
children
pouncing
upon
the
flower
petals
behind
as
rapidly
as
they
were
blessed
by
his
tread
and
carrying
them
off
as
sacred
relics
outwardly
he
seemed
sunk
in
the
profoundest
depths
of
devotion
yet
twice
at
a
sign
from
me
he
halted
the
procession
as
by
previous
understanding
until
i
had
caught
a
picture
over
the
door
of
the
towered
into
which
the
throng
crowded
after
him
were
the
words
haec
est
domus
dei
et
porta
no
doubt
they
were
right
but
it
would
have
been
easy
to
have
mistaken
it
for
something
else
toward
evening
the
subprefect
s
secretary
brought
a
indian
and
introducing
him
as
the
owner
of
a
horse
called
upon
me
to
pay
cents
at
once
for
the
use
of
it
the
moment
i
had
done
so
he
produced
a
still
dirtier
indian
and
introducing
him
as
my
guide
demanded
that
he
be
paid
fifty
cents
that
over
the
secretary
mentioned
that
it
was
customary
to
give
a
gratification
to
owner
and
guide
that
they
might
drink
my
good
health
for
the
coming
voyage
at
the
end
of
which
he
further
hinted
it
was
costumbre
to
grant
the
guide
a
for
alfalfa
for
the
animal
and
something
for
himself
for
chicha
and
but
by
that
time
i
had
withdrawn
to
my
quarters
at
six
in
the
morning
i
was
dressed
and
ready
at
seven
the
guide
came
to
know
if
he
really
should
bring
the
horse
at
eight
i
burst
in
upon
the
sleeping
subprefect
to
know
what
had
become
of
his
boisterous
promise
to
have
food
prepared
for
me
at
dawn
a
soldier
was
sent
to
investigate
in
due
time
he
came
back
with
the
information
that
the
cook
was
not
up
yet
at
nine
the
horse
arrived
it
was
a
wild
hairy
mountain
colt
a
bit
larger
than
an
ass
which
had
never
been
shod
curried
or
trimmed
the
equipment
it
wore
was
wholly
bridle
of
braided
rawhide
without
bits
like
that
with
which
our
american
indian
rides
his
mustang
a
tiny
crude
wooden
saddle
with
one
thickness
of
leather
stretched
over
it
and
huge
wooden
now
let
nothing
worry
you
cried
the
subprefect
as
i
bade
farewell
to
the
noble
city
of
cabana
the
guide
trotting
on
foot
behind
i
ll
telegraph
the
gobernador
of
corongo
and
huaylas
and
the
subprefect
of
the
next
province
so
that
he
can
telegraph
his
governors
and
the
prefect
in
huaráz
no
se
moleste
señor
everything
will
be
arranged
by
the
hours
of
unbroken
climbing
brought
us
to
a
páramo
where
flakes
of
snow
actually
fell
and
across
the
icy
lagoons
of
which
a
wind
that
penetrated
to
the
marrow
swept
from
off
the
surrounding
so
small
was
my
animal
that
i
expected
him
to
drop
under
me
at
every
step
so
tiny
that
his
front
knees
constantly
knocked
the
stirrups
off
my
feet
and
so
wobbly
in
his
movements
that
it
was
like
riding
a
at
last
we
caught
the
valley
of
a
descending
river
and
racked
and
shaken
in
every
bone
i
rode
into
the
plaza
of
corongo
the
population
of
which
seemed
to
take
a
pleasure
in
the
predicaments
of
others
evidently
this
was
no
new
characteristic
for
stevenson
writing
a
century
ago
states
corongo
is
certainly
the
most
disagreeable
indian
town
i
ever
the
gobernador
sat
gossiping
in
the
mud
hut
to
which
the
telegraph
wire
led
he
had
not
however
received
any
message
from
cabana
as
telegrams
cost
authorities
nothing
i
had
permitted
myself
to
hope
that
at
least
this
promise
would
be
kept
having
no
other
way
of
getting
rid
of
me
however
the
town
ruler
led
the
way
to
his
own
hovel
where
long
after
dark
his
females
prepared
me
a
bowl
of
gruel
with
which
to
break
an
fast
the
language
of
corongo
is
chiefly
quichua
little
in
evidence
since
ecuador
but
due
from
now
on
to
be
more
general
than
spanish
the
gobernador
ran
no
unnecessary
risk
of
having
me
left
on
his
hands
and
by
six
next
morning
the
owner
of
a
new
horse
an
even
more
striking
caricature
of
what
he
was
supposed
to
represent
than
that
of
the
day
before
had
collected
his
fee
and
that
of
the
new
these
paid
he
began
at
once
to
complain
that
the
animal
could
not
travel
far
without
being
shod
a
luxury
which
like
his
master
he
had
thus
far
never
enjoyed
on
the
advice
of
the
gobernador
i
added
a
for
that
purpose
two
hours
later
i
raised
so
effective
a
protest
against
further
delay
that
the
animal
was
dragged
in
still
unshod
as
he
would
be
to
the
end
of
time
and
made
ready
the
price
more
or
less
exorbitant
in
honor
of
my
helpless
situation
and
gringo
blood
would
not
have
mattered
had
not
each
authority
stood
in
cahoots
with
the
owners
and
wasted
my
time
and
energy
with
their
clumsy
grafts
under
a
brilliant
sun
we
squirmed
away
out
of
town
and
began
a
sharp
descent
into
one
of
the
mightiest
desert
gorges
in
all
the
andes
my
guide
a
fellow
speaking
only
quichua
who
had
plodded
at
a
horse
s
tail
all
his
days
slapping
along
behind
me
in
his
leather
sandals
incessantly
feeding
himself
lime
and
coca
leaves
it
would
have
been
difficult
enough
for
a
man
in
the
best
of
health
to
sit
such
an
animal
standing
still
on
the
level
let
those
who
can
imagine
one
with
barely
the
strength
left
to
hold
himself
together
riding
him
down
shale
hillsides
often
at
a
sharp
angle
the
stirrups
knocked
from
his
inert
feet
every
few
yards
now
the
entire
range
cutting
off
the
world
on
the
east
was
capped
with
snow
making
the
scorched
and
thirsty
valley
the
more
tantalizing
by
comparison
on
through
blazing
noon
i
clung
to
that
diminutive
brute
with
his
murderous
over
blistered
waterless
hills
harsh
and
repulsive
in
their
barrenness
to
fetch
up
at
sunset
more
dead
than
alive
in
yuramarca
a
scattered
village
of
far
more
than
respectable
inhabitants
here
instead
of
the
penetrating
cold
of
corongo
was
to
be
feared
the
fever
of
the
hot
lands
the
gobernador
was
a
ragged
barefoot
indian
not
over
eighteen
one
of
the
few
in
town
who
spoke
spanish
and
inclined
to
insolence
in
consequence
he
pointed
out
a
mud
cave
on
the
plaza
as
the
of
all
travelers
i
protested
against
lying
on
the
bare
earth
no
hay
más
growled
the
haughty
official
of
course
there
was
nothing
more
there

the
first
ten
or
twelve
requests
among
these
pitiless
aboriginals
an
hour

coaxing
and
threatening
nicely
interwoven
and
the
gobernador
strolled
across
the
plaza
and
came
back
with
just
the
thing
six
by
door
covered
on
one
side
with
zinc
i
ordered
the
guide
to
place
the
saddle
in
the
room
lest
he
decamp
during
the
night
gave
him
a
for

for

the

twice
the
necessary
amount
to
find

for
a

of
gruel
to
the
unspeakable
old
female
he
ordered
to
prepare
it

she
delivered

after

my
nurses
in
the
hospital
of
caráz
before
daylight
of
a
moonlit
sunday
morning
we
were
off
again
through
the
same
dreary
desert
the
sun
having
first
to
climb
the
cordillera
only
overtook
us
as
we
were
crossing
the
decrepit
little
bridge
high
above
the
santa
river
racing
through
its
resounding
gorge
on
its
way
to
the
pacific
the
endless
climb
beyond
was
by
so
narrow
a
trail
along
the
face
of
a
yawning
precipice
that
my
saddlebags
scraped
continually
along
the
mountain
wall
and
here
and
there
a
jutting
rock
thumped
me
sharply
on
the
knee
at
scorching
high
noon
we
caught
sight
between
grim
austere
mountain
flanks
of
a
long
tilted
valley
lightly
covered
in
all
its
extent
with
tiled
houses
among
scrub
trees
which
my
peon
announced
was
huaylas
i
had
heard
such
rosy
reports
of
this
city
that
my
hopes
grew
buoyant
again
before
a
view
delightful
to
the
eye
weary
with
the
savage
solitudes
behind
but
it
turned
out
to
be
but
another
of
those
bowelless
mountain
towns
whose
ragged
inhabitants
remind
one
of
buzzards
hovering
about
a
moribund
each
snatching
what
he
can
as
soon
as
he
dares
don

an
anemic
dwarf
of
outwardly
white

owner
of
the
chief
shop
of
huaylas
ran
a
sort
of
amateur
hotel
at
prices
the
on
the
back
veranda
guests
likewise
struggled
to
jumble
of
ancient
and
noisome
structures
and
in
the
most
distressing
of
which
a
leprous
old
hag
concocted
the
inedible
messes
that
were
poked
through
a
repulsive
hole
in
the
wall
an
unconscionable
time
after
they
were
ordered
the
rheumatic
and
dismal
den
to
which
i
was
assigned
was
below
the
street
level
though
i
could
see
through
the
window
the
brilliant
sunny
day
outside
and
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
serrated
line
of
snow
peaks
away
to
the
east
but
the
good
people
of
huaylas
informed
in
some
way
of
my
place
of
lodging
amused
themselves
by
pounding
on
the
window
bars
shouting
amiable
insults
in
upon
me
and
now
and
then
tossing
in
clods
of
earth
and
an
occasional
stone
that
did
not
always
fall
short
of
their
aim
as
i
had
had
no
quarrel
with
the
priest
he
could
not
have
denounced
me
as
a
heretic
it
must
have
been
simply
their
racial
delight
in
producing
or
watching
suffering
the
same
trait
that
brings
them
joy
during
the
sorriest
moments
of
a
and
causes
them
to
gather
in
crowds
to
tease
and
jeer
at
an
idiot
or
a
cripple
it
was
taco
who
finally
came
to
my
rescue
taco
was
a
japanese
chief
servant
of
don
ricardo
and
the
only
really
intelligent
or
humane
person
i
had
met
since
walking
out
of
the
doctor
s
house
in
huamachuco
it
was
with
deep
regret
that
i
paid
his
worthless
master
for
what
the
servant
really
furnished
the
peon
who
was
to
start
with
me
at
dawn
next
day
was
still
wallowing
among
the
at
blazing
ten
and
i
was
weakly
urging
a
the
journey
was
an
imposing
personage
of
white
skin
wearing
a
leather
cap
and
real
shoes
pushed
through
the
jeering
throng
and
announced
himself
the
congressman
for
that
district
having
heard
my
tale
of
woe
he
gave
me
a
card
ordering
the
of
caráz
to
admit
me
to
the
hospital
there
and
in
due
time
prevailed
upon
the
besotted
peon
to
be
off
the
order
was
addressed
to
one
luís
phillips
and
vastly
buoyed
up
by
the
promise
inherent
in
such
a
name
i
endured
uncomplainingly
the
trot
to
which
the
delayed
start
had
sentenced
me
town
after
town
had
proved
such
dismal
disappointments
that
i
did
not
look
forward
to
caráz
with
any
overwhelming
glee
but
my
hopes
rose
high
when
we
surmounted
one
of
the
countless
desert
ridges
and
sighted
at
last
a
vast
level
though
somewhat
tilted
plain
between
the
santa
river
and
the
brilliant
white
snow
peaks
of
the
ever
higher
cordillera
with
hundreds
upon
hundreds
of
inviting
houses
specking
with
red
its
many
orchards
and
checkered
green
patches
of
cultivation
the
andes
rise
to
appalling
heights
in
these
parts
and
take
on
a
variety
of
color
and
form
almost
comparable
to
the
alps
in
beauty
vastly
outdoing
them
in
a
certain
wild
somber
undomesticated
grandeur
under
the
declining
sun
the
bold
and
impressive
range
turned
from
tawny
brown
to
deep
purple
then
to
tender
violet
and
soft
lilac
as
they
receded
the
snowy
heads
of
the
peaks
seeming
to
hang
suspended
in
the
evening
sky
the
bridge
to
the
north
was
in
ruins
and
i
had
to
ride
more
than
a
mile
beyond
the
town
to
catch
the
road
from
the
south
that
carried
us
at
last
into
the
place
as
the
shopkeepers
were
putting
up
their
wooden
shutters
it
was
almost
a
city
with
evidence
of
considerable
commerce
and
civilization
great
glaciers
gazing
coldly
down
from
the
transparent
sky
of
evening
into
the
neat
little
plaza
a
considerable
percentage
of
the
inhabitants
were
white
in
color
but
this
was
apparently
only
at
the
entrance
to
the
doctor
s
patio
i
was
met
by
his
wife
a
woman
to
all
outward
appearances
educated
and
civilized
but
environment
is
a
powerful
factor
she
differed
not
in
the
least
from
the
indians
of
corongo
having
informed
me
with
an
icy
indifference
that
the
doctor
was
somewhere
in
the
town
she
refused
even
to
permit
me
to
enter
the
patio
to
wait
for
him
there
being
nowhere
else
to
go
i
was
forced
to
remain
more
than
an
hour
astride
the
animal
i
could
scarcely
cling
to
after
eight
hours
of
racking
trot
not
a
drop
of
anything
could
i
get
for
my
raging
thirst
instead
the
woman
s
saucy
children
joined
a
score
of
other
urchins
of
the
town
in
crowding
around
me
and
concocting
all
manner
of
annoyances
even
to
throwing
stones
and
striking
the
horse
unawares
on
the
legs
while
a
score
of
adults
looked
on
from
the
street
corners
or
their
doorways
at
the
at
first
sight
of
the
doctor
long
after
dark
my
hopes
gushed
up
like
a
spurting
geyser
but
they
fell
leadenly
to
the
ground
as
he
opened
his
lips
the
son
of
an
englishman
stranded
a
ago
in
this
corner
of
peru
he
looked
as
british
as
any
stroller
along
piccadilly
yet
in
speech
manner
and
mental
processes
he
was
spig
to
the
core
with
a
eagerness
to
be
rid
of
anything
suggesting
labor
or
annoyance
he
asked
a
few
superficial
questions
grunted
twice
after
the
manner
of
physicians
and
led
the
way
down
the
cobbled
street
my
habit
of
picturing
in
detail
every
coming
scene
had
only
been
increased
by
my
condition
and
i
braced
myself
to
enter
a
dismal
barren
mud
room
with
a
score
of
beds
filled
with
peruvian
soldiers
in
which
the
pilfering
of
my
possessions
would
be
the
least
of
the
annoyances
awaiting
me
i
was
most
agreeably
disillusioned
the
hospital
at
caráz
was
a
new
whitewashed
pleasant
little
building
recently
erected
by
a
society
of
inhabitants
there
were
not
a
patients
and
in
painting
my
picture
i
had
completely
overlooked
the
andean
rules
of
caste
however
nastily
he
may
treat
him
otherwise
the
meanest
peruvian
would
not
so
far
forget
his
training
as
to
put
a
white
man
among
indians
or
soldiers
i
was
given
full
possession
of
a
long
room
opening
on
the
patio
and
with
a
large
barred
window
on
the
street
the
best
chamber
in
the
building
indeed
except
the
director
s
office
true
the
bed
was
and
i
had
to
ask
the
caretaker
to
remove
his
champion
gamecock
from
the
he
tied
him
by
a
leg
just
outside
the
who
could
be
so
cruel
as
to
ask
a
peruvian
to
keep
his
rooster
where
he
can
not
gloat
over
him
as
he
works
the
doctor
came
for
a
minute
and
a
half
every
morning
the
hospital
being
a
public
institution
and
he
a
government
doctor
he
scowled
at
my
offer
to
pay
for
treatment
the
caretaker
and
especially
his
wife
with
a
seared
and
face
like
that
of
a
old
german
peasant
woman
were
kindly
if
not
experienced
nurses
i
could
scarcely
have
fallen
upon
a
finer
spot
as
nature
goes
to
be
laid
on
the
caráz
feet
above
was
at
an
ideal
height
as
a
place
of
recuperation
its
splendid
climate
tempered
and
clarified
by
the
snowclads
above
an
open
stream
made
music
by
my
window
the
sun
was
unbrokenly
brilliant
from
the
time
it
crawled
over
the
to
the
east
till
it
dropped
behind
the
western
ranges
i
needed
no
clock
to
tell
the
time
of
day
it
was
when
the
first
golden
streak
fell
upon
the
whitewashed
wall
beneath
the
window
when
the
golden
rectangle
that
marked
the
open
door
to
the
patio
stood
upright
when
the
cast
their
first
shadow
on
the
tiled
floor
and
when
these
elongated
to
emaciated
slenderness
faded
away
into
the
purple
darkness
of
evening
two
youths
of
the
town
dropped
in
on
me
one
day
and
brought
an
ancient
book
of
tales
but
it
goes
without
saying
that
i
had
no
hint
of
what
was
going
on
in
the
wide
world
beyond
the
encircling
ranges
the
unique
feature
of
the
hospital
was
that
no
provision
whatever
was
made
for
patients
to
wash
even
face
and
hands
bathing
was
looked
upon
as
highly
dangerous
to
invalids
and
it
was
only
after
several
days
and
at
the
expense
of
much
argument
that
i
finally
caused
a
washtub
of
tepid
water
to
be
dragged
into
the
room
chapter
xii
the
roof
of
peru
for
a
week
i
improved
under
the
doctor
s
care
i
had
already
strolled
once
or
twice
around
the
neat
little
plaza
down
upon
which
the
massive
snowclad
peaks
gaze
with
paternal
serenity
but
my
legs
were
still
in
that
condition
that
made
my
feet
lead
ingots
and
no
pleasure
quite
outdid
that
of
lying
abed
watching
the
sunshine
crawl
across
the
floor
and
listening
to
the
keeper
s
rooster
challenging
the
world
to
combat
i
should
have
regretted
a
controversy
with
that
rooster
during
those
days
i
am
sure
he
would
have
worsted
me
on
sunday
the
first
of
june
the
doctor
did
not
appear
nor
the
next
day
nor
the
next
medicines
and
tonics
ran
out
i
decided
to
push
on
next
morning
before
what
strength
i
had
regained
evaporated
entirely
but
during
the
night
there
came
upon
me
a
pain
under
which
i
could
only
writhe
and
stuff
my
throat
with
bedclothes
when
i
had
enjoyed
this
an
hour
or
two
a
brilliant
thought
struck
me
all
the
night
only
the
rooster
slept
within
shouting
painted
fanciful
pictures
of
a
grave
looked
down
upon
by
the
paternal
serene
peaks
through
the
ages
to
come
for
it
was
easy
to
guess
how
effectively
the
surgeons
of
the
andes
would
their
and
in
the
morning
i
sent
the
caretaker
to
summon
the
doctor
before
he
set
out
on
his
rounds
about
nine
he
came
back
to
announce
in
a
manner
suspiciously
sheepish
that
the
señor
doctor
médico
titular
was
confined
to
his
bed
as
the
day
wore
on
the
fellow
overcame
his
racial
lack
of
initiative
to
the
extent
of
bringing
me
a
potion
from
the
chief
but
it
had
little
effect
then
all
at
once
taco
the
japanese
of
huaylas
grinned
in
on
me
through
the
bars
of
my
window
and
a
later
the
keeper
of
the
had
come
in
person
it
is
congestion
of
the
bowels
señor
he
announced
these
pílduras
will
relieve
it
the
doctor
was
to
have
changed
the
treatment
on
sunday
to
avoid
this
is
the
doctor
seriously
ill
i
asked
señor
said
the
druggist
after
a
moment
of
hesitation
on
saturday
night
the
médico
titular
took
some
liquor
at
a
tertulia
it
is
fatal
to
him
he
can
not
stop
it
is
now
four
days
that
he
has
lain
mareado
seasick
and
he
has
not
been
able
to
visit
one
of
his
patients
out
in
the
pueblos
three
have
already
died
for
there
is
no
other
i
had
been
ten
days
in
caráz
when
in
spite
of
a
soreness
within
and
an
annoying
lack
of
vigor
i
decided
to
push
on
afoot
a
broad
road
led
south
along
the
green
and
fertile
valley
of
the
santa
shut
in
on
either
hand
by
the
yellow
flanks
of
barren
mountains
as
between
unscalable
walls
the
way
was
with
stolid
indians
speaking
no
spanish
and
a
felt
hat
of
was
now
taking
the
place
of
the
dingy
panamas
that
had
been
almost
universal
since
southern
ecuador
it
was
only
a
simple
day
s
walk
eight
miles
to
another
provincial
capital
but
it
seemed
at
least
twenty
especially
as
the
perfectly
level
road
kept
mounting
steadily
for
yungay
is
a
thousand
feet
higher
than
caráz
the
mass
of
huascarán
king
of
that
magnificent
range
that
dwarfs
the
alps
bulked
menacingly
almost
sheer
above
the
bucolic
old
plaza
when
i
plodded
across
it
in
the
sleepy
silence
of
noonday
to
the
dwelling
of
an
unusually
subprefect
next
morning
yungay
stretched
for
miles
along
the
highway
and
had
scarcely
ended
when
mancos
began
this
department
of
ancachs
and
the
valley
of
the
santa
is
the
most
densely
populated
region
of
peru
the
fifteen
miles
to
carhuáz
was
what
the
peruvians
call
an
excellent
road
to
a
people
of
wider
outlook
it
would
have
been
recognizable
as
a
broad
expanse
of
loose
stones
undulating
over
barren
ridges
relieved
by
the
bracing
mountain
air
from
off
the
bulk
of
huascarán
here
seeming
to
hang
suspended
overhead
the
water
of
all
this
valley
is
reputed
a
source
of
several
dread
diseases
among
them
the
warty
indigenous
to
peru
the
bottle
of
boiled
swinging
from
my
leather
harness
lasted
but
a
few
dry
miles
and
i
could
only
fall
back
not
without
misgiving
on
chicha
announced
for
sale
by
a
little
red
flag
before
an
occasional
hut
along
the
way
the
bridge
that
once
lifted
the
camino
real
across
the
swift
cold
stream
at
the
edge
of
the
green
oasis
that
marked
the
end
of
the
day
s
tramp
had
gone
the
way
of
most
peruvian
bridges
and
left
me
to
wade
strangely
enough
my
host
of
yungay
had
kept
his
word
to
telegraph
the
gobernador
of
carhuáz
and
i
sat
down
almost
upon
arrival
with
the
family
at
a
dinner
served
after
the
patriarchal
manner
of
the
andes
to
those
of
us
at
table
the
wife
at
the
head
granted
the
full
meal
from
the
hot
peppery
soup
of
ancachs
to
the
dessert
of
fried
plantains
in
honey
crude
sugar
to
the
dozen
indian
servants
squatted
along
the
wall
she
dished
out
frugally
the
coarser
viands
to
each
according
to
his
station
in
life
the
bedraggled
scullion
getting
only
a
small
gourdful
of
boiled
corn
and
yuca
during
our
sunday
stroll
in
the
plaza
the
gobernador
introduced
me
in
the
same
careful
order
to
every
town
celebrity
down
to
the
last
teniente
after
which
we
of
the
élite
gathered
round
the
town
clerk
in
a
corner
of
the
square
to
hear
read
the
weekly
bulletin
from
the
cable
of
foreign
news
via
lima
to
the
last
testimonial
to
the
efficacy
of
the
pills
of
ross
as
a
panacea
of
all
earthly
misfortunes
i
was
miles
south
before
the
first
rays
of
monday
s
sun
fell
upon
me
and
even
after
that
was
able
to
sneak
along
for
hours
in
the
shadow
of
the
cordillera
so
closely
did
it
stand
above
me
town
rapidly
succeeded
town
with
miles
of
almost
unbroken
crowding
a
damnably
cobbled
road
to
barely
the
width
of
a
wheeled
vehicle
not
even
along
an
english
highway
would
more
houses
have
been
shops
the
male
population
spoke
a
more
or

was
setting
when
i
halted
at
a
corner
of
huaráz
main
plaza
my
legs
leaden
with
the
undulating
stony
miles
behind
me
to
inquire
for
that
famous
hotel
rumor
had
pictured
for
weeks
gone
by
the
conviction
came
upon
me
that
there
would
not
be

hotel
even
in

a
citizen
of
huaráz
did
point
out
to
me
a
building
boasting
itself
the

but
all
it
offered
was
a
few
rooms
to
let
to
me
fell
that
of

a
chamber
forming
a
front
corner
of
the
building
and
opening
on
both
the
street
and
the
entrance
to
the
patio
it
had
once
been
the
oratorio
of
a
private
dwelling
and
the
altar
and
its
decorations
were
still
intact
except
that
the
virgin
had
flown
from
her
niche
across
the

was
a
chinese
fonda
with
the
same
bill
of

worse

worse

more

this
was
the
of
the
élite
among
the
homeless
transients
i
had
not
the
courage
to
investigate
the
dozen
other
chinese
and
native
restaurants
scattered
about
town
huaráz
capital
of
the
most

and
the
largest

i
had
yet
seen
since
crossing

is
really
but
another
mud
village
of
the
andes
differing
from
the
rest
only
in
size
its
adobe
buildings
seldom
rise
above
a
story
and
a
half
in
height
its
rusticated
inhabitants
in
ragged
costumes
the
majority
speaking
only
quichua
were
for
the
most
part
and
disagreeable
in
manner

to
gringos
whose

or

they
seemed
to
resent
even
the
small
percentage
of

that
is
for
there
were
many
who
no
doubt
mistakenly
considered
themselves
gaping
mountaineers
to
be
sure
was
to
be
found
and
there
were
actually
three
or
four
clumsy
carts
like
the
rural
wagons
of
england
the
arrival
of
which
was
no
doubt
an
event
in
the
town
history
foreign
residents
were
numerous
especially
chinamen
who
owned
many
of
the
shops
of
importance
leaving
the
natives
to
squat
in
the
street
with
their
few
cents
of
wares
the
town
itself
has
nothing
picturesque
about
it
neither
in
the
color
and
style
of
its
houses
nor
the
rags
of
its
inhabitants
but
this
is
far
more
than
made
up
for
by
the
magnificent
range
of
snowclad
peaks
that
climb
up
into
the
blue
all
about
it
towering
close
above
the
town
on
the
east
and
stretching
away
into
the
north
to
end
in
the
enormous
mass
of
huascarán
its
climate
colder
than
that
of
quito
and
with
a
perpetually
brilliant
sunshine
and
an
invigorating
crispness
to
the
air
was
delightful
there
was
even
a
shelf
of
books
for
sale
in
one
of
the
larger
establishments
though
the
nearest
i
came
to
finding
literature
of
the
country
for
the
road
ahead
was
björnson
s
sendas
de
diós
whatever
it
may
be
called
in
norwegian
rumor
had
it
that
the
tramp
over
the
icy
cordillera
central
that
now
lay
before
me
would
be
impossible
even
to
a
man
in
the
most
sturdy
condition
to
slip
down
to
the
coast
and
sail
for
lima
would
have
been
easy
but
a
racial
obstinacy
forced
me
to
pursue
to
the
bitter
end
the
task
i
had
set
myself
though
it
promised
only
the
monotony
of
familiar
experience
and
further
intercourse
with
a
people
that
had
grown
utterly
antipathetic
in
habit
feature
and
character
an
american
resident
furnished
me
a
horse
and
a
peon
for
the
first
day
s
journey
the
prefect
had
favored
me
with
the
customary
flowery
document
to
his
subordinates
along
the
way
ordering
them
to
lend
me
all
classes
of
it
would
have
been
far
more
to
the
point
had
he
commanded
them
more
specifically
to
assist
me
to
acquire
an
occasional
plate
of
beans
the
dusty
road
close
along
the
diminishing
river
was
well
traveled
chiefly
by
long
donkey
trains
and
plodding
expressionless
indians
huts
and
even
small
villages
were
frequent
the
barren
ranges
crowding
ever
closer
and
dwindling
almost
to
foothills
or
rather
seeming
so
to
dwindle
as
we
mounted
ever
higher
beyond
the
bridge
that
carried
us
back
to
the
right
bank
of
the
santa
were
scores
of
little
often
hanging
far
up
the
steep
hillsides
and
indians
were
threshing
the
grain
by
driving
their
animals
round
and
round
the
circles
of
hard
earth
in
which
it
had
been
spread
and
tossing
it
high
in
the
air
with
wooden
shovels
until
the
wind
had
carried
away
the
chaff
the
monotonous
mud
town
of
recuay
notorious
for
its
gazed
stolidly
upon
us
as
we
trotted
on
to
ticapampa
headquarters
of
a
french
mining
company
the
several
tall
chimneys
of
which
were
belching
their
smoke
into
the
brilliant
sky
their
ugliness
offset
by
the
first
suggestion
of
industry
in
peru
it
cost
me
three
days
and
several
tramps
back
to
recuay
to
find
a
mount
for
the
journey
ahead
walking
would
have
been
far
less
laborious
but
there
were
sixteen
leagues
of
bleak
foodless
páramos
and
two
ranges
separating
me
from
the
first
suggestion
of
habitation
on
the
further
side
of
the
great
central
chain
of
the
andes
that
stretched
away
to
north
and
south
further
than
the
eye
could
command
like
an
impassable
barrier
set
by
nature
against
the
wilfulness

within
a

the

of

so
effectually
that

drunken

the

ordered
the
abject

to
be
ready
at
six
in
the
morning
to
accompany
me
to
huallanga
some
two
leagues
further
up
the
contracted
valley
we
crossed
the
now
tiny
santa
by
a
bridge
of
sticks
and
catching
the
gorge
of
a
little
stream
fed
by
the
glaciers
above
plunged
due
east
into
the
mountains
the
sun
had
burned
our
faces
in
the
river
valley
an
hour
afterward
it
was
cold
as
late
november
rain
began
but
quickly
turned
to
a
mixture
of
hail
and
snow
dusk
overtook
us
at
the
foot
of
a
mighty
glacier
though
not
until
we
had
sighted
one
of
the
rare
shepherd
s
huts
that
huddled
in
an
occasional
stony
hollow
these
miserable
indian
of
the
upper
heights
are
built
of
heaped
up
to
the
height
of
a
and
covered
with
brown
ichu
grass
hardly
as
large
and
quite
as
crude
as
those
the
beaver
fashions
defending
their
miserable
inmates
neither
from
wind
nor
rain
a
single
room
which
can
only
be
entered
on
hands
and
knees
houses
the
whole
family
whom
a
sheepskin
or
two
serves
as
bed
and
two
or
three
earthen
pots
as
utensils
in
which
to
cook
their
scanty
fare
over
an
ichu
or
fire
in
the
center
of
the
windowless
hovel
totally
indifferent
to
wealth
or
comfort
with
hardly
fuel
enough
for
cooking
purposes
the
stolid
inhabitants
slink
into
their
squalid
dens
as
soon
as
the
sun
has
withdrawn
his
genial
rays
and
shiver
through
a
night
during
which
they
get
almost
no
unbroken
sleep
with
scarcely
enough
food
to
keep
themselves
from
starvation
the
house
swarms
of
mangy
curs
that
curl
up
among
them
by
night
and
which
being
never
fed
dash
greedily
at
any
offal
like
the
pigs
of
central
america
here
there
was
a
second
kennel
oval
in
shape
which
the
woman
permitted
us
to
occupy
because
she
was
asked
in
her
own
tongue
by
one
of
her
own
people
both
she
and
her
children
were
barefoot
and
in
scanty
garb
yet
appeared
completely
indifferent
to
the
icy
cold
which
if
less
in
degrees
than
in
a
canadian
was
more
penetrating
we
carried
blankets
sufficient
to
pass
the
night
comfortably
huddled
close
together
but
as
often
as
i
stepped
out
into
the
brilliant
moonlight
in
which
the
above
us
stood
forth
like
fissured
and
fantastic
the
very
marrow
in
my
bones
seemed
to
congeal
covered
the
earth
and
ice
a
thick
lay
on
the
stagnant
puddles
when
we
set
out
in
the
bitter
cold
dawn
across
a
region
drear
in
the
extreme
stiff
stony
climbs
carried
us
up
to
the
very
edges
of
immense
glaciers
and
through
patches
of
snow
that
threw
the
sharp
rays
of
the
highland
sun
into
our
eyes
and
faces
like
a
spray
of
needles
the
day
was
as
laborious
as
any
i
had
ever
spent
afoot
miles
over
the
wintry
double
crest
of
the
central
cordillera
on
a
mule
who
jolted
my
unaccustomed
frame
to
a
wreck
before
i
finally
slid
gratefully
to
the
ground
in
the
bleak
of
huallanga
this
was
a
slight
oasis
of
imported
life
in
a
wild
almost
uninhabited
region
the
peruvian
of
which
was
extraordinary
from
at
least
two
points
of
view
was
blond
as
a
norseman
and
so
advanced
in
his
customs
that
i
dared
even
address
his
wife
directly
at
table
next
day
i
a
decided
caravan
of
a
local
merchant
whose
arrieros
were
bound
for
cerro
de
pasco
with
a
troop
of
a
civilized
indian
that
is
one
who
wore
shoes
and
spoke
spanish
called
for
me
with
a
horse
the
crude
native
saddle
covered
with
a
the
hairy
all
horsemen
use
in
this
region
and
soon
after
noon
we
jogged
away
down
a
stony
little
river
the
merchant
had
duly
and
honestly
warned
me
that
being
only
his
were
gifted
with
no
gentle
pace
but
he
had
not
warned
me
that
i
was
joining
a
i
drew
on
ahead
in
spite
of
myself
and
when
barely
eight
miles
from
huallanga
the
shrieks
and
whistles
of
the
drivers
died
out
behind
i
waited
a
in
vain
then
went
back
some
distance
to
find
them
lassoing
the
animals
one
by
one
piling
their
loads
or
in
a
hollow
square
and
turning
them
loose
with
their
front
feet
crudely
hobbled
there
were
nineteen
animals
mostly
in
ballast
attended
by
four
arrieros
too
lazy
apparently
to
unsling
their
pots
and
cook
supper
the
patched
and
quartet
munched
a
bit
of
parched
corn
and
a
sheet
of
beef
and
sat
all
night
drinking
and
wailing
maudlin
ballads
the
tent
stretched
over
the
packs
was
so
low
that
i
had
to
lie
down
on
the
ground
and
roll
under
it
and
so
thin
that
the
rain
dripped
in
upon
me
almost
in
streams
it
was
still
black
night
when
the
canvas
was
pulled
off
me
and
i
found
the
arrieros
already
engaged
in
a
riotous
effort
to
round
up
the
animals
this
was
no
simple
task
in
spite
of
the
hobbles
and
the
morning
was
well
advanced
before
the
last
of
the
troop
had
been
lassoed
and
loaded
during
the
operation
i
suggested
that
we
prepare
at
least
a
pot
of
tea
but
valenzuela
the
chief
arriero
dismissed
the
matter
with
a
grimace
and
a
neither
wood
nor
grass
will
burn
after
the
rain
and
i
could
only
choke
my
hunger
with
a
lump
of
bread
and
shiver
under
my
poncho
until
i
mounted
this
time
a
mule
to
spare
the
animal
of
the
day
before
we
followed
the
so
long
that
it
turned
almost
uncomfortably
warm
then
suddenly
abandoning
the
highway
to
modern
huánuco
and
the
roundabout
but
warm
and
route
to
cerro
de
pasco
the
arrieros
drove
the
animals
up
a
steep
gorge
between
towering
mountain
walls
by
what
looked
like
a
spillway
from
a
this
was
the
very
route
i
should
have
chosen
for
while
the
longer
one
would
have
been
more
comfortable
this
followed
very
closely
the
ancient
inca
highway
topping
the
horizon
we
trotted
on
across
an
enormous
plain
of
scanty
ichu
vegetation
that
stretched
away
to
the
hazy
foot
of
what
looked
from
this
height
like
low
hills
here
was
just
such
a
place
as
the
incas
requiring
an
unbroken
outlook
over
the
surrounding
world
and
grazing
land
for
their
llamas
chose
for
their
cities
i
was
not
surprised
therefore
to
find
a
long
expanse
of
the
páramo
covered
with
hundreds
of
stone
ruins
only
the
walls
still
standing
from
one
to
eight
feet
high
in
broken
fantastic
disarray
this
was
huánuco
el
viejo
which
the
spaniards
found
an
important
city
at
the
time
of
the
conquest
but
which
the
less
hardy
descendants
abandoned
as
in
so
many
cases
for
a
warmer
valley
eighteen
leagues
to
the
east
history
does
not
reach
back
to
the
origin
of
old
huánuco
the
ruins
of
which
still
occupy
almost
a
square
mile
of
the
silent
utterly
uninhabited
plain
the
mere
interweaving
of
faint
paths
across
the
andean
within
five
hundreds
yards
of
the
ruins
but
the
caravan
pushed
on
without
a
halt
as
if
these
monuments
of
their
ancestors
were
mere
unworthy
a
glance
of
attention
i
turned
and
trotted
away
across
the
plain
bathed
in
the
cold
glaring
sunshine
of
the
andean
plateau
toward
the
site
valenzuela
after
a
shout
of
protest
stuck
close
on
my
heels
whether
out
of
fear
that
i
would
decamp
with
the
mule
or
lay
hands
on
some
old
inca
treasure
or
from
some
superstition
connected
with
the
gentiles
i
do
not
know
there
was
really
little
to
be
seen
every
one
of
the
countless
ruins
of
large
and
small
buildings
arranged
more
or
less
in
squares
were
sections
of
walls
mere
without
sign
of
mortar
as
crude
as
the
of
shepherds
now
fallen
until
in
many
places
only
their
symmetrical
arrangement
suggested
the
hand
of
man
to
this
there
was
only
one
exception
some
three
hundred
yards
from
the
rest
of
the
ruins
was
a
rectangular
fortress
of
carefully
cut
and
nicely
fitted
stone
blocks
with
suggestions
of
cement
now
mere
walls
some
fifteen
feet
high
filled
level
full
of
earth
on
which
the
drear
ichu
grew
as
thickly
as
on
the
surrounding
plain
except
in
extent
the
ruins
were
not
to
be
compared
with
those
of
though
the
castillo
closely
resembled
in
construction
and
the
single
monument
of
ingapirca
in
southern
ecuador
we
trotted
on
after
the
and
rode
for
some
hours
over
low
ridges
each
of
which
brought
to
view
a
new
expanse
of
dreary
yellowish
landscape
occasionally
an
arriero
broke
forth
in
a
mournful
song
that
rose
and
fell
with
the
same
monotony
as
the
undulating
páramo
now
and
then
as
a
pack
worked
loose
one
of
the
muleteers
dismounted
and
deftly
slipping
out
of
his
poncho
threw
it
over
the
head
of
the
animal
and
readjusted
the
load
to
my
surprise
quickly
followed
by
my
disgust
the
train
soon
after
noon
swung
into
the
field
of
a
low
hut
similar
to
but
far
more
miserable
and
tiny
than
those
of
the
ancient
city
behind
greeting
the
barefoot
indian
woman
who
emerged
on
all
fours
from
the
hut
the
arrieros
began
to
round
up
and
unload
the
animals
though
we
had
not
made
fifteen
miles
we
were
to
stop
here
for
the
night
i
swallowed
my
wrath
reflecting
that
he
who
joins
a
must
not
expect
express
speed
it
was
too
cold
to
sit
and
i
took
to
promenading
weakly
about
the
hillside
down
in
a
hollow
beyond
i
came
upon
a
family
preparing
their
crop
of
potatoes
after
the
ancient
inca
fashion
still
common
to
the
andes
this
in
the
chief
vegetable
of
andean
marketplaces
and
the
principal
food
of
the
indians
of
the
sierra
the
newly
dug
potatoes
are
spread
out
on
the
ground
at
a
high
altitude
preferably
on
the
bank
of
a
highland
lake
or
stream
and
left
to
freeze
by
night
they
are
small
potatoes
for
the
indian
s
mode
of
selection
has
been
to
plant
only
the
smallest
eating
or
selling
the
larger
until
the
tubers
indigenous
to
peru
have
degenerated
to
the
same
low
level
as
their
horses
and
dogs
when
the
sun
has
thawed
the
potatoes
the
indians
of
the
household
tread
out
the
juice
with
their
bare
feet
then
spread
them
in
the
sun
to
dry
this
produces
the
or
black
chuño
which
in
the
time
of
the
incas
was
the
only
kind
permitted
the
common
people
and
which
forms
the
chief
product
of
the
process
those
who
prefer
the
twice
frozen
white
chuño
which
graced
only
the
tables
of
the
incas
and
nobles
put
the
tubers
inside
a
well
of
under
the
surface
of
a
river
or
lake
and
leave
them
from
two
to
eight
days
after
which
they
are
dried
in
the
sun
the
result
is
a
food
that
will
keep
indefinitely
but
which
has
very
much
the
same
taste
as
so
much
fried
sand
the
most
common
method
of
preparing
these
frozen
potatoes
is
to
grind
them
in
a
stone
mortar
and
use
the
powdered
chuño
to
thicken
soup

barely
nine
degrees
below
the
equator
in
the
foreground
is
my
guide
of
the
obstreperous
wife
when
the
head
of
the
indian
household
arrived
he
opened
with
valenzuela
a
conversation
in
quichua
of
which
i
caught
enough
to
learn
that
we
were
to
drive
a
league
west
in
the
morning
to
wait
a
day
for
some
species
of
cargo
stop
to
pick
up
another
load
a
few
leagues
beyond
and
so
on
indefinitely
i
called
the
arriero
aside
and
protested
that
aside
from
the
hardships
and
exposure
of
lying
out
on
every
i
was
steadily
growing
worse
for
lack
of
treatment
to
my
surprise
he
proposed
that
i
ride
on
alone
next
day
as
he
would
never
have
dreamed
of
making
such
a
proposal
to
a
peruvian
stranger
it
spoke
well
of
the
opinion
he
had
gathered
of
americans
from
contact
with
them
in
the
mining
town
toward
which
we
were
headed
a
bed
of
several
was
spread
for
me
beneath
the
flap
of
the
canvas
covering
our
packs
out
under
the
shivering
stars
that
stood
forth
in
the
luminous
highland
sky
with
the
unnatural
luster
of
electric
bulbs
during
the
later
hours
of
the
night
when
i
rolled
out
into
the
cold
still
air
a
brilliant
full
moon
was
flooding
with
almost
the
light
of
noonday
the
rolling
mountainous
world
about
us
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
i
knew
only
too
well
that
a
matter
settled
the
night
before
would
have
to
be
argued
out
anew
in
the
morning
dawn
crept
up
over
the
eaves
of
the
east
and
the
god
of
the
incas
flung
his
horizontal
rays
across
the
empty
plateau
but
valenzuela
assuming
the
customary
air
in
such
cases
that
we
had
neither
of
us
meant
what
we
had
said
the
evening
before
made
no
move
to
prepare
for
my
departure
when
i
reminded
him
of
his
promise
he
announced
that
he
would
of
course
keep
it
if
i
really
seriously
desired
it
only
it
would
be
utterly
impossible
for
a
man
unacquainted
with
the
route
to
find
his
way
across
the
often
unmarked
punas
and
pampas
ahead
then
too
it
was
infested
with
bands
of
robbers
who
at
times
attacked
whole
to
say
nothing
of
one
lone
helpless
gringo
if
only
i
would
wait
until
he
and
i
would
ride
on
alone
at
breakneck
speed
and
make
up
for
all
the
delay
i
had
long
since
learned
the
close
resemblance
of
the
south
american
mañana
to
a
greased
pig
moreover
i
had
no
desire
to
ride
at
breakneck
speed
he
muttered
under
his
breath
at
this
gringo
obstinacy
and
ordered
the
youngest
arriero
to
saddle
a
horse
and
accompany
me
the
latter
refused
valenzuela
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
a
gesture
that
meant
you
see
it
is
out
of
the
but
the
experienced
andean
traveler
can
always
win
his
point
if
he
insists
long
and
hard
enough
the
chief
arriero
gave
up
at
last
and
sent
a
man
to
lassoo
and
saddle
not
the
stout
mule
he
had
promised
the
evening
before
but
one
of
the
saddest
imitations
of
the
genus
horse
in
camp
and
late
in
the
morning
i
rode
down
through
the
gully
and
away
over
the
brown
and
sterile
world
spread
broad
and
high
before
me
the
arriero
s
first
prophecy
came
quickly
true
i
lost
the
road
a
stretch
of
what
was
evidently
the
old
inca
highway
broad
and
and
lined
by
two
rows
of
stones
pushed
straight
on
over
all
obstacles
in
what
seemed
to
be
the
right
direction
but
it
did
not
fit
the
descriptions
that
had
been
given
me
the
trail
i
followed
led
me
down
into
two
gaping
hamlets
that
had
not
been
mentioned
and
doubled
the
miles
to
baños
somnolent
as
an
italian
village
at
summer
noonday
down
in
the
throat
of
a
gorge
the
frowsy
chusco
already
gave
signs
of
not
being
able
to
endure
the
journey
all
i
demanded
was
a
reasonable
walking
pace
yet
it
cost
me
far
more
labor
than
to
have
made
the
trip
afoot
to
keep
the
animal
moving
a
scant
two
miles
an
hour
it
was
evident
that
for
all
my
incessant
labor
we
should
not
reach
before
nightfall
the
hacienda
we
were
seeking
and
when
it
came
on
to
rain
and
hail
in
a
cold
bleak
bowl
of
mountains
i
turned
toward
a
collection
of
huts
that
stood
out
dimly
as
an
animal
of
protective
coloring
on
the
upper
edge
of
the
hollow
the
indian
men
patronizing
and
arrogant
in
their
clumsy
way
as
usual
in
such
situations
offered
me
the
customary
block
of
wood
on
which
to
squat
under
the
eaves
of
the
i
took
weakly
to
promenading
the
miles
in
the
saddle
out
of
my
legs
and
furtively
inspected
the
six
huts
that
made
up
the
collection
all
were
dens
roofed
with
ichu
against
several
of
which
immense
quantities
of
dried
were
stacked
like
cordwood
the
women
squatting
over
the
fire
in
the
center
of
one
of
the
huts
handled
fuel
and
food
at
one
and
the
same
time
though
they
were
barefoot
and
scantily
clad
the
men
wore
heavy
wool
stockings
to
their
knees
and
crude
moccasins
of
a
strip
of
hairy
cowhide
drawn
together
over
the
foot
with
a
puckering
string
of
rawhide
the
males
spoke
considerable
spanish
but
the
women
knew
or
pretended
to
know
only
quichua
there
were
attached
to
the
place
at
least
a
score
of
dogs
who
set
up
a
chorus
as
often
as
i
stirred
and
at
intervals
even
without
that
provocation
across
the
shallow
hollow
the
long
line
of
peaks
that
had
grown
up
along
the
entire
eastern
horizon
during
the
day
stood
forth
in
bold
and
impressive
majesty
in
the
light
of
evening
a
light
that
seemed
strained
through
crystals
when
the
mountain
cold
settled
down
like
an
icy
sheet
i
asked
where
i
might
sleep
why
there
in
the
corredor
to
be
sure
mumbled
the
indian
we
gente
blanca
have
not
the
indifference
to
cold
of
los
naturales
i
replied
well
then
here
in
the
kitchen
he
grumbled
how
about
that
casita
i
asked
pointing
to
a
against
the
largest
hut
that
is
where
the
family
and
that
i
persisted
indicating
a
structure
of
beehive
or
shape
built
entirely
of
ichu
and
with
a
rounded
door
not
three
feet
high
that
stood
forth
on
a
knoll
behind
the
others
but
that
it
seemed
was
where
the
watchman
what
he
watched
was
not
apparent
after
a
long
conference
in
quichua
however
this
was
assigned
me
with
sullen
grace
a
boy
was
sent
to
drag
out
the
watchman
s
bed
of
sheepskins
and
i
struggled
up
to
the
shelter
with
saddle
pack
and
equipment
and
crawled
inside
on
hands
and
knees
the
choza
was
constructed
on
the
same
plan
as
the
wigwams
of
the
american
red
men
pole
frame
set
up
and
covered
with
mountain
grass
through
which
the
bitter
wind
that
swept
across
this
sterile
upland
cut
as
a
knife
through
cheesecloth
and
so
low
that
even
in
the
center
i
could
barely
stand
upright
on
my
knees
the
chusco
had
been
turned
over
to
a
boy
who
was
to
watch
it
all
night
for
a
week
s
wage
it
was
not
that
i
took
much
stock
in
the
indian
s
assertion
that
there
was
in
these
parts
but
i
hoped
by
this
arrangement
to
forestall
any
rascality
he
might
himself
set
afoot
the
watching
however
was
evidently
by
some
species
of
aboriginal
telepathy
for
not
only
was
no
sign
of
a
guardian
to
be
seen
as
often
as
i
crawled
out
into
that
interminable
night
but
when
morning
came
the
head
of
the
household
greeted
me
with
el
chusco
se
ha
animal
has
lost
lost
i
cried
sí
señor
but
it
will
be
found
again
the
boy
has
already
been
sent
to
search
for
how
even
my
instinct
for
guessing
aright
among
a
hundred
splendid
chances
to
go
astray
saved
me
from
getting
hopelessly
lost
during
that
day
i
have
never
been
able
to
fathom
across
the
utterly
uninhabited
and
almost
untraveled
the
trail
was
at
best
faintly
marked
and
finally
beyond
the
cold
blue
lake
of
lauracocha
reputed
the
real
source
of
the
amazon
it
disappeared
altogether
for
hours
i
prodded
my
wretched
imitation
of
a
horse
forward
by
compass
over
hill
and
dale
and
by
some
stroke
of
luck
fell
upon
the
trail
again
beyond
soon
the
pampa
gave
way
to
green
and
tremulous
sod
and
a
swamp
in
which
i
all
but
mired
the
animal
beyond
recovery
nor
did
the
route
hold
to
the
same
direction
but
frequently
sidestepped
unexpectedly
for
no
apparent
reason
and
it
was
only
by
the
general
lay
of
the
hills
and
the
instinct
of
long
practice
that
i
picked
it
up
again
once
it
split
evenly
and
the
branch
i
chose
led
far
up
the
face
of
a
cliff
the
path
hewn
in
the
sheer
wall
growing
ever
narrower
until
the
animal
thumped
my
knee
against
the
stone
precipice
and
all
but
pitched
us
headlong
into
the
appalling
ravine
below
to
dismount
was
no
simple
task
and
had
the
horse
been
a
foot
longer
i
should
not
have
succeeded
in
turning
him
around
and
leading
the
way
back
to
the
fork
on
the
other
side
of
the
peak
was
a
great
natural
stone
stairway
down
which
the
animal
slipped
and
dropped
with
a
painful
succession
of
jolts
the
gorge
narrowed
and
deepened
then
suddenly
close
at
hand
on
the
steep
flank
of
the
mountain
appeared
the
first
llamas
i
had
seen
in
peru
a
whole
flock
of
them
from
then
on
they
were
so
frequent
that
within
the
next
i
had
seen
far
more
llamas
than
in
all
the
rest
of
my
life
a
new
costume
for
men
at
first
sight
ludicrous
came
into
evidence
almost
at
the
same
time
instead
of
trousers
they
wore
very
roomy
breeches
cut
off
exactly
at
the
knee
so
that
the
first
glimpse
of
their
wearers
at
a
distance
was
little
short
of
startling
suggesting
for
a
moment
the
astounding
incongruity
of
an
indian
woman
sporting
the
skirt
of
a
below
these
garments
they
wore
the
long
knitted
wool
stockings
gray
or
black
and
the
hairy
cowhide
moccasins
that
had
first
appeared
a
few
days
before
and
as
they
passed
me
they
snatched
off
their
heavy
brown
felt
hats
with
some
mumbled
greeting
in
quichua
while
enjoying
a
racking
fever
in
the
comparatively
comfortable
home
of
the
gobernador
of
yanahuanca
i
learned
that
there
were
two
ways
of
reaching
cerro
de
pasco
one
was
to
ride
nine
leagues
across
a
trackless
puna
on
which
a
lone
gringo
was
sure
to
get
lost
and
die
of
exposure
the
other
was
to
travel
about
half
that
distance
by
a
road
to
goyllarisquisca
where
los
americanos
have
their
coal
mines
and
whence
there
ran
a
daily
train
i
could
not
believe
that
fate
would
be
so
crude
a
practical
joker
as
to
let
a
man
who
had
found
his
way
clear
from
bogotá
go
astray
on
the
last
day
of
his
journey
but
i
could
easily
conceive
of
the
wreck
of
a
horse
wilting
between
my
leaden
legs
somewhere
out
on
the
unmarked
pampa
moreover
the
sight
of
a
railroad
would
be
a
comparatively
new
experience
i
decided
on
the
shorter
route
it
necessitated
the
gobernador
calling
me
at
two
in
the
morning
before
a
raging
fever
had
entirely
burned
itself
out
an
indian
in
flowing
breeches
leading
a
horse
that
was
to
bring
back
some
arrival
by
train
and
another
astride
a
pitifully
small
pony
led
the
way
out
into
the
luminous
starlit
night
a
good
road
tacked
gradually
upward
through
a
sleeping
village
hanging
like
some
prehensile
creature
on
the
swift
hillside
where
the
dogs
sang
us
a
rousing
chorus
and
lifted
us
in
some
three
hours
to
the
summit
of
a
ridge
down
the
further
slope
of
which
sprawled
headlong
a
still
larger
town
fantastic
of
profile
in
the
morning
starlight
we
labyrinthed
through
it
meeting
scores
of
and
moccasined
indians
and
barefoot
women
and
girls
toiling
marketward
under
atrocious
burdens
for
the
day
was
sunday
below
the
town
we
came
out
on
a
road
paralleling
a
stupendous
gorge
and
across
it
so
high
above
that
i
could
scarcely
believe
it
possible
a
cluster
of
electric
lights
suspended
in
the
night
between
earth
and
heaven
mingled
with
the
stars
and
half
blotted
out
at
intervals
by
the
smoke
of
american
industry
marked
goyllarisquisca
a
city
of
the
sky
to
see
which
we
must
crane
our
necks
like
countrymen
at
the
foot
of
man
s
mightiest
monument
the
stars
went
out
one
by
one
like
turned
off
by
hurrying
the
luminous
night
turned
to
colorless
opaque
dawn
in
which
the
jagged
sierra
stood
out
flat
and
featureless
as
if
cut
out
of
cardboard
we
went
down
and
ever
down
into
an
unconscionable
gorge
to
is
the
ghastly
futility
of
insignificant
stream
then
quickly
began
to
climb
again
there
was
a
path
straight
up
the
to
goyllarisquisca
a
path
which
a
man
unsusceptible
to
dizziness
and
capable
of
climbing
a
steep
stairway
of
a
hundred
thousand
steps
without
or
a
landing
on
which
to
pause
for
breath
might
cover
in
a
instead
we
wound
around
the
entire
mountain
through
another
town
fantastic
in
its
perpendicular
setting
as
the
last
yet
reduced
in
the
disillusioning
light
of
day
to
its
drab
reality
and
uncovering
others
pitched
at
queer
places
on
unattainable
noses
and
hollows
of
the
range
in
which
the
shadows
still
lurked
like
skulking
bandits
the
mountains
beyond
were
garbed
from
head
to
foot
in
white
robes
and
in
the
valleys
lay
seas
of
mist
from
which
emerged
crags
and
peaks
like
uninhabited
rocky
islands
less
beautiful
perhaps
in
its
aspect
than
the
more
colorful
alps
the
scene
vastly
outdid
these
in
its
rugged
masculine
grandeur
little
by
little
we
fell
in
with
an
almost
unbroken
procession
of
indians
here
and
there
one
clad
in
exotic
overalls
whispered
the
approach
of
american
influence
and
at
length
our
breathless
animals
staggered
over
the
last
ridge
into
the
village
of
the
name
before
me
lay
a
small
pittsburgh
not
so
small
at
that
with
great
cranes
swinging
across
the
gorges
unsentimental
stone
buildings
roaring
and
chimneys
belching
forth
the
sooty
smoke
of
industry
long
rows
of
decent
were
interspersed
with
longer
ones
of
box
and
flat
cars
and
sprawling
about
the
higher
levels
were
native
shacks
so
tinged
with
the
foreign
influence
that
even
a
protruded
here
and
there
from
their
roofs
of
wavy
across
the
scene
floated
the
sweet
music
of
a
american
train
whistle
and
on
every
hand
was
the
evidence
of
diligence
masculine
toil
and
effective
that
quickened
my
northern
pulse
like
a
deep
draft
of
wine
it
was
like
coming
back
to
my
native
world
after
a
long
absence
scores
of
things
i
had
never
before
seen
in
south
america
surged
up
about
me
and
upon
me
came
drowsy
contentment
that
my
struggles
were
behind
me
and
that
i
had
already
virtually
set
foot
in
the
central
plaza
of
lima
i
slipped
clumsily
off
the
miserable
chusco
and
turned
him
over
trappings
and
all
to
the
indian
who
was
to
deliver
him
to
valenzuela
when
he
passed
through
yanahuanca
my
legs
obeyed
me
sullenly
as
if
weighted
with
ball
and
chain
and
my
physical
condition
gave
to
my
movements
a
hesitating
deliberate
dignity
at
the
station
was
a
restaurant
run
by
a
chinaman
with
peruvian
assistance
where
the
american
influence
by
no
means
ceased
at
bacon
and
eggs
but
had
reached
the
height
of
butter
and
sliced
bread
and
rosy
bottles
of
catsup
in
a
corner
of
the
room
a
blazed
merrily
the
first
artificial
heat
i
had
felt
in
a
long
two
years
i
wandered
out
upon
the
platform
at
the
far
end
stood
a
man
fondling
a
dog
a
real
dog
not
an
andean
cur
and
as
i
approached
he
protested
affectionately
and
ineffectually
now
you
get
down
you
re
dirtying
my
there
was
no
mistaking
that
vocabulary
even
if
the
strangely
nasal
accent
that
struck
my
unaccustomed
ear
rudely
had
not
sufficed
to
betray
the
speaker
s
nationality
peruvians
do
not
fondle
dogs
nor
do
they
refer
to
their
nether
garments
in
that
abrupt
and
familiar
fashion
i
was
soon
seated
in
a
comfortable
a
stack
of
new
york
papers
beside
me
but
i
gave
up
in
despair
explaining
how
i
had
come
to
pronounce
it
having
ever
been
either
in
lima
or
the
cerro
and
i
fancy
i
had
convinced
my
host
of
nothing
except
that
i
was
a
clumsy
and
unconscionable
liar
before
the
giant
baldwin
rolled
in
dragging
behind
it
a
american
as
if
some
branch
of
the
railways
of
my
own
land
had
pierced
this
lofty
nook
of
the
andes
the
official
business
of
the
line
is
to
transport
coal
to
the
mines
at
cerro
de
pasco
and
passengers
are
accepted
only
on
suffrance
the
coach
was
the
familiar
old
american
caboose
with
a
line
of
leather
cushions
along
the
walls
and
a
coal
stove
in
the
center
it
was
empty
when
i
entered
but
had
i
not
almost
forgotten
the
ways
of
travelers
i
should
not
have
been
so
surprised
when
it
at
length
filled
to
overflowing
with
noisy
native
women
a
few
men
of
the
class
drummers
for
the
most
part
hideous
with
rings
and
every
species
of
bundle
and
cumbersome
baggage
then
two
robust
american
trainmen
genuine
as
if
they
had
that
moment
been
picked
off
the
top
of
a
transcontinental
stamped
in
climbed
into
their
cupola
and
we
were
off
it
was
the
reaction
no
doubt
from
the
straining
months
behind
me
that
brought
on
a
paludismo
that
set
me
shaking
even
under
my
poncho
but
the
unaccustomed
artificial
heat
all
but
choked
me
and
when
i
had
accepted
an
orange
and
gravely
refused
the
whiskey
brandy
and
black
coffee
my
sympathetic
would
have
forced
upon
me
as
sure
cures
i
climbed
into
the
cupola
the
landscape
would
not
have
been
joyful
under
the
best
of
conditions
a
bare
faintly
rolling
its
frosty
soil
cherishing
no
vegetation
except
the
dreary
ichu
of
the
uplands
stretched
monotonously
away
on
every
hand
its
surface
flooded
with
the
brilliant
thin
sunshine
of
andean
plateaux
and
mottled
here
and
there
with
fleecy
cloud
shadows
now
and
then
a
flock
of
llamas
lifted
their
absurd
heads
to
gaze
after
us
as
we
sped
past
once
or
twice
we
stopped
at
a
standing
out
pitifully
unsheltered
on
the
treeless
waste
halted
an
hour
at
grimy
la
fundición
with
its
smelters
and
drew
up
at
dusk
in
bare
and
dreary
cerro
de
pasco
it
was
june
three
months
from
the
peruvian
frontier
and
miles
from
bogotá
of
which
i
had
covered
on
horseback
and
by
rail
on
the
train
i
had
been
the
of
a
heated
difference
of
opinion
the
peruvian
passengers
contended
that
i
should
descend
by
the
morning
express
to
lima
where
i
would
quickly
recover
under
the
care
of
famous
physicians
of
the
capital
the
that
i
should
enter
the
hospital
of
the
american
mining
company
on
the
there
could
be
no
debate
between
entrusting
myself
again
to
the
careless
inefficiency
of
native
practitioners
and
the
happy
opportunity
of
entering
an
institution
conducted
by
men
of
my
own
race
when
i
had
found
a
boy
to
carry
my
baggage
i
set
out
with
high
hopes
if
slow
steps
for
the
american
hospital
it
was
an
imposing
building
covering
a
space
equal
to
a
city
block
and
forming
a
hollow
square
around
an
extensive
patio
on
the
far
edge
of
the
drear
and
colorless
american
mining
town
well
removed
from
its
smoke
and
swirling
dust
and
disturbing
noises
my
welcome
was
not
to
be
sure
exactly
what
a
morbid
imagination
had
led
me
to
picture
but
that
was
no
doubt
due
to
the
fact
that
both
doctors
were
at
the
moment
absent
the
overcame
in
time
her
inclination
to
refuse
me
admittance
and
sent
an
indian
boy
closely
related
in
personal
habits
to
the
occupants
of
chozas
to
show
me
into
a
ward
in
appearance
it
was
all
that
a
hospital
ward
should
be
its
ten
imported
cots
all
unoccupied
the
boy
jerked
his
head
sidewise
toward
a
chair
and
disappeared
two
empty
hours
dragged
funereally
by
then
another
indian
youth
startlingly
like
a
personification
of
squalor
and
uncleanliness
in
a
masque
gotten
up
by
some
stern
disciple
of
the
zola
school
of
realism
burst
in
upon
my
feverish
dreams
and
before
i
could
raise
a
hand
in
protest
thrust
a
thermometer
into
my
mouth
evidently
it
was
his
assigned
duty
to
take
the
temperature
of
anyone
caught
on
the
premises
had
i
come
into
the
ward
to
recane
the
chairs
no
doubt
he
would
have
forced
a
thermometer
down
my
throat
like
some
automatic
machine
worked
by
springs
removed
and
shaken
it
wiped
it
on
the
seat
of
his
trousers
and
pattered
away
on
his
bare
feet

dashed

had
no

about
to
be
served
and
ordering
me
to

for

again
i
protested
that
i
had
brought
with
me
the
unpleasant
evidence

long

travel

jerked
a
thumb
over
his
shoulder
with
a
parting
mumble
of
there
was
one
even
as
he
had
indicated
with
all
modern
appliances
but
like
most
inventions
transplanted
to

andes
it
did
not
another
example
of
the
peruvian
abhorrence
of
soap
was
ordered
to
bring
a
pails
of
hot
water

in

haste
to
be
done
with
the
task
he
translated
into

and

at
last

cots

afterward
the
indian
boy
came
to
climb
into
another

the
same
identical
rags
he
wore
by
day
the
dinner
was
evidently
a
prolonged
and
engaging
function
for
neither
the
doctor
nor
any
other
sign
of
human
interest
appeared
again
during
a
night
in
which
i
tossed
incessantly
with
fever
while
the
ward
blazed
with
electric
lights
and
the
ineffectual
thumped
and
pounded
like
an
adjacent
i
am
happy
to
be
able
to
say
that
neither
the
two
physicians
whom
we
will
disguise
under
the
pseudonyms
of
f
and
d
nor
the
of
the
american
hospital

came
from
further
north
materially
an
establishment
to
boast
of
its
condition
in
anything
touched
by
the
personal
equation
was
incredible
homeopathic
in
creed
it
put
its
trust
in
pills
and
left
the
rest
to
eight
immature
indians
as
devoid
of
human
instincts
as
of
supervision
in
a
second
cheerless
bare
ward
adjoining

one
i
occupied
were
a
score
of
injured
or
ailing
indian
workmen
yet
no
precaution
whatever
was
taken
to
keep
infection
from
passing
from
one
room
to
the
other
a
single
thermometer
served
all
alike
twice
a
day
the
automatic
youth
of
the
bare
feet
went
the
rounds
in
quest
of
temperatures
carrying
a
bottle
of
antiseptic
so
low
in
stock
that
it
did
not
reach
a
third
as
far
up
the
instrument
as
did
the
lips
of
patients
and
too
indolent
to
go
to
the
dispensary
for
cotton
he
wiped
it
after
each
use
on
whatever
came
within

his
trousers

the
noisome
rag
each
servant
carried
over

the
ten
cots
had
been
full
instead
of
the
four
that
represented
the
maximum
of
occupancy
during
my
stay
i
do
not
know
what
habits
we
might
have
adopted
for
there
were
only
three
cups
three
tablespoons
and
one
teaspoon
attached
to
the
ward
the
printed
rules
announced
that
were
and
in
practice
they
averaged
breakfast
to
dinner
to
and
supper
about
the
same
stern
placard
called
attention
to
the
fact
that
visitors
were
admitted
only
on
sunday
afternoons
yet
scarcely
a
night
passed
without
a
mob
of
indians
or
cholos
male
and
female
friends
of
the
internes
or
of
some
inmate
stamping
into
the
ward
as
soon
as
darkness
had
settled
down
and
often
keeping
up
an
uproar
until
long
after
midnight
then
it
was
the
unexplainable
custom
on
those
days
set
for
that
ceremony
to
drag
out
a
at
four
in
the
morning
and
wash
down
the
ward
like
the
deck
of
a
ship
flooding
the
floor
an
inch
or
more
deep
in
icy
highland
water
through
which
patients
put
to
that
necessity
might
wade
to
and
from
their
cots
in
the
sumptuous
quarters
of
physicians
and
nurses
occupying
all
the
front
half
of
the
building
the
formal
repasts
were
provided
with
every
obtainable
delicacy
and
enlivened
with
music
and
gaiety
in
the
wards
the
ostensibly
diet
monotonously
reduced
itself
in
practice
to
the
leathery
green
beefsteaks
of
the
andes
and
two
or
three
other
articles
sanctioned
by
prehistoric
andean
the
racial
lack
of
initiative
is
nowhere
more
in
evidence
than
in
the
kitchen
if
doctor
or
nurse
prescribed
some
special
dish
for
a
patient
there
came
back
in
authority
had
disappeared
from
the
threadbare
peruvian
prevarication
no
hay
which
meant
that
the
cook
was
giving
vent
to
his
temperamental
grouchiness
was
too
lazy
to
set
another
pot
on
the
fire
or
was
keeping
the
delicacy
for
himself
or
some
the
youthful
trained
in
the
far
north
was
supremely
ignorant
of
tropical
diseases
and
what
was
worse
had
no
inclination
to
add
to
his
professional
knowledge
his
interests
were
confined
to
the
contents
of
a
row
of
unhomeopathic
bottles
and
the
manipulation
of
small
cardboards
at
the
a
few
blocks
away
where
he
might
be
not
easily
almost
any
hour
ensconced
in
one
of
the
lounges
before
the
blazing
fireplace
the
gringa
chose
to
do
duty
by
day
and
arising
every
forenoon
came
in
to
smile
at
each
of
us
about
ten
and
sometimes
again
in
the
early
afternoon
before
it
was
time
to
dress
for
her
daily
bridge
and
tea
in
a
loquacious
moment
she
confided
to
me
that
she
just
loved
to
travel
and
having
always
longed
to
see
strange
foreign
countries
like
peru
had
been
delighted
to
get
an
appointment
to
spend
a
year
or
two
in
it
the
was
the
most
disturbingly
beautiful
peruvian
it
had
so
far
been
my
fortune
to
set
eyes
upon
she
took
the
customary
advantage
of
that
fact
by
making
no
effort
to
be
anything
else
being
a
subordinate
she
was
obliged
to
take
the
but
being
also
a
peruvian
she
did
not
often
permit
that
misfortune
to
break
her
night
s
rest
five
days
i
had
studied
its
ceiling
when
the
morning
brought
f
physician
in
chief
who
had
been
absent
on
a
round
of
the
company
s
hospitals
hurrying
into
the
ward
he
was
a
far
more
successful
practitioner
than
his
youthful
that
he
made
the
daily
round
in
about
five
minutes
less
than
the
ten
which
d
squandered
two
or
three
mornings
later
he
paused
at
my
cot
to
grumble
querulously
it
s
funny
you
don
t
get
better
it
must
be
you
are
not
making
up
your
mind
to
mental
attitude
you
know
as
soon
as
you
had
that
purge
these
pills
should
have
taken
hold
at
that
what
i
murmured
oh
don
t
be
stupid
the
d
gave
you
a
day
after
you
turned
up
here
the
basis
of
our
system
of
i
have
had
only
nonsense
d
what
day
did
this
man
have
his
purge
i
prescribed
it
last
monday
yawned
the
assistant
of
course
now
but
i
assure
you
i
have
yet
to
know
the
taste
of
who
gave
him
the
oil
the
doctor
flung
over
a
shoulder
señorita
replied
the
subordinate
naming
the
peruvian
nurse
she
chanced
to
pass
the
door
in
fetching
a
moment
later
and
was
called
in
to
confirm
the
statement
ah
es
verdad
she
lisped
in
her
beautiful
nonchalance
me
forgot
and
with
a
bewitching
smile
at
the
physicians
she
hurried
away
to
her
daytime
engagements
determined
not
to
celebrate
my
nation
s
birthday
as
i
had
my
own
i
forced
my
leaden
legs
to
carry
me
on
an
afternoon
stroll
through
the
famous
mining
town
the
skies
of
cerro
de
pasco
three
miles
aloft
and
boasting
itself
the
highest
city
in
the
world
are
clear
beyond
any
description
in
mere
words
not
once
during
my
sojourn
there
was
the
penetrating
brilliancy
flecked
by
the
slightest
whiff
of
cloud
the
sun
blazed
down
with
an
intensity
that
burned
the
cheeks
as
at
the
open
mouth
of
a

even
at
blinding

cold

a
power
of
penetration
unknown
to
a
northern
day
on
which
the
mercury
falls
far
lower
those
who
ascend
the
hill
from
lima
complain
of
a
leaden
inertia
and
pains
varying
in
intensity
and
duration
brought
on
by
an
altitude
that
is
fatal
to
weak
hearts
and
to
victims
of
pneumonia
inured
to
the
heights
and
scantiness
of
air
almost
unbrokenly
from
bogotá
i
had
no
consciousness
of
any
such
effects
nearly
a
mile
from
the
hospital
the
american
town
of
stone
buildings
and
even
less
attractive
structures
such
as
the
tin
can
an
ugly
red
barracks
that
houses
the
garden
variety
of
gringo
employees
scattered
among
bare
protruding
rocks
of

landscape
dreary
beyond
conception
gives
way
to
the
old
familiar
peruvian
huts
and
hovels
these
in
turn
develop
further
on
into
dwellings
above
and
shops
below
often
quaint
and
striking
in
architecture
if
any
city
of
peru
may
be
called
unique
in
appearance
it
is
el
even
in
the
center
of
the
town
roofs
of
ancient
straw
alternate
with
those
of
wavy
instead
of
the
monotonously
square
blocks
of
other
andean
cities
its
older
section
is
a
tangle
of
narrow
streets
and
misshapen
buildings
like
a
change
from
our
middle
west
to
boston
perched
on
the
summit
of
the
world
with
scarcely
a
knoll
overtopping
it
or
the
suggestion
of
a
shrub
to
shelter
it
the
cerro
is
the
unhampered
playground
of
icy
mountain
winds
laden
with
stinging
sand
and
the
soot
and
smoke
and
powdered
ore
from
its
mines
bronzed
foreigners
and
miners
in
leather
leggings
and
boots
squeaking
through
the
streets
afoot
or
astride
mules
lend
the
place
an
air
of
modernity
for
all
its
swarms
of
indians
in
contrast
droves
of
llamas
with
gaily
colored
ribbons
in
their
ears
slip
past
in
noiseless
dignity
or
stand
in
patient
groups
before
a
chichería
awaiting
their
drivers
the

similar
trades

stocks
unknown
to
those
sections
of
the
andes
where
the
imports
depend
on
transportation
en

even
the
pulperías
are
with
foodstuffs
testifying
to
the
american
influence
from
a
knoll
rising
a
bit
above
the
rest
the
eye
is
gladdened
by
the
glimpse
of
a
lake
of
considerable
size
strangely
beautiful
in
its
drear
and
dismal
setting
from
this
point
of
vantage
too
the
stranger
becomes
aware
that
el
cerro
is
much
more
of
a
city
than
he
suspected
filling
the
great
lap
of
a
repulsive
barren
range
and
stretching
away
in
several
directions
under

with

the
immaculate
staff
of
the
cerro
de
pasco
hospital
twelve
days
i
had
tarried
in
cerro
de
pasco
and
had
advanced
from
my
original
ailment
to
one
distinctly
more
serious
when
i
concluded
to
descend
to
lima
while
i
still
had
strength
to
do
so
the
company
collected
a
fee
that
more
than
doubled
my
expenditures
since
leaving
quito
and
spared
himself
the
annoyance
of
penning
a
receipt
or
of
any
other
formality
beyond
that
of
dropping
the
handful
of
gold
sovereigns
into
his
pocket
on
his
breathless
morning
round
the
night
sky
was
turning
slightly
more
transparent
along
the
cold
eastern
horizon
when
i
tottered
out
of
the
hospitable
cerro
de
pasco
hospital
on
my
way
to
the
station
the
car
was
a
stoveless
densely
packed
with
indians
and
all
the
aboriginal
is
accustomed
to
carry
with
him
a
glance
at
it
sufficed
to
dissipate
my
resolution
to
save
a
sovereign
from
the
wreck
of
my
fortune
the
coach
was
an
american
car
scantily
filled
with
peruvians
and
and
americans
under
forty
husky
in
build
and
untrammelled
in
manners
the
wintry
july
dawn
climbed
up
over
the
far
edge
of
the
bleak
treeless
world
and
at
smelter
cheerless
beyond
words
in
the
daylight
we
were
joined
by
more
americans
wrapped
as
were
also
many
of
the
natives
in
huge
sweaters
dressed
even
in
all
the
clothing
i
possessed
i
kept
my
poncho
close
about
me
for
the
in
the
front
end
of
the
car
was
no
match
for
the
frigidity
of
the
vast
pampa
de
junín
across
which
we
were
soon
speeding
only
by
frequently
scratching
a
in
the
frosted
window
could
i
gaze
out
upon
the
drear
yellow
world
with
its
snow
peaks
rising
slightly
above
it
in
the
distance
and
its
great
flocks
of
llamas
feeding
along
the
way
between
streams
and
pools
off
in
both
directions
stood
scattered
stone
huts
with
roofs
before
which
barefoot
brr
indian
women
stood
or
squatted
and
scantily
clad
children
gazed
after
the
train
with
the
stolidity
and
indifference
to
the
bitter
cold
of
the
adobe
images
they
somehow
suggested
here
was
the
scene
of
the
great
battle
of
junín
in
which
the
soldiers
of
bolívar
defeated
the
spanish
host
but
it
is
not
likely
that
either
pursued
or
pursuers
dripped
with
perspiration
a
dreary
walk
indeed
this
would
have
been
across
the
icy
endless
yellow
pampa
a
brilliant
sun
popped
up
instantly
in
a
faultless
sky
like
some
suddenly
released
but
though
it
flooded
all
the
visible
world
with
golden
light
it
brought
slight
warmth
beside
each
seat
of
our
car
was
an
electric
button
and
beneath
it
a
list
of
possibilities
in
english
and
spanish
one
had
only
to
press
it
and
presto
a
big
black
my
memories
of
other
days
deceive
me
no
big
black
negro
would
get
this
high
in
the
world
unless
he
were
dragged
there
by
main
little
dapper
noiseless
inscrutable
chinaman
slipped
down
upon
one
and
lent
an
attentive
yet
haughty
ear
into
which
one
whispered
the
desires
of
the
inner
man
tempered
by
a
subconscious
regard
for
one
s
purse
calling
modestly
for
toast
and
coffee
if
one
were
a
mere
american
vagabond
who
had
recently
fallen
among
pardon
physicians
or
for
the
whole
damn
works
which
meant
the
same
coffee
and
toast
plus
a
plate
of
bacon
and
eggs
if
one
were
an
american
miner
homeward
bound
to
whom
money
is
as
water
to
the
man
whose
pocket
holdeth
a
quart
bottle
of
concentrated
joyfulness
across
the
aisle
were
two
such
from
whom
sounded
now
and
then
some
pleasant
anticipation
of
homecoming
an
when
i
get
back
to
pittsburgh
i
m
goin
into
the
house
bar
and
tell
joe
to
mix
me
a
real
an
when
he
says
where
t
ell
you
been
these
two
years
hank
i
ll
jus
say
diggin
coal
down
in
joe
an
he
ll
call
the
bouncer
to
throw
me
a
big
blue
lake
chinchaycocha
on
the
distant
right
drew
the
eyes
toward
it
then
came
a
brief
halt
at
the
town
of
junín
an
extensive
collection
of
huts
and
fences
with
a
church
in
their
midst
and
steam
rising
on
the
wintry
air
from
the
nostrils
of
every
living
being
then
at
last
after
an
extended
wandering
search
the
train
found
the
rocky
bed
of
a
small
river
and
wound
and
squirmed
with
it
through
openings
in
the
hills
until
a
masculine
whistle
caused
us
to
scratch
a
new
in
the
frosted
window
to
find
oroya
rising
up
to
meet
us
here
the
american
train
and
roadbed
abandoned
us
to
the
tender
mercies
of
the
ferrocarril
central
theoretically
under
english
management
but
in
practice
dismally
from
to
trailing
packed
into
the
far
corner
of
a
seat
upholstered
only
in
name
i
had
frozen
from
toes
to
the
bottom
of
my
poncho
for
two
mortal
hours
before
the
peruvian
engineer
came
to
an
understanding
with
the
peruvian
conductor
and
and
dragged
us
slowly
out
of
town
from
a
spot
on
the
nothing
ticlio
summit
of
the
line
we
began
the
long
coast
down
to
the
pacific
through
all
the
customary
tunnels
bridges
and
switchbacks
where
for
the
brakes
to
lose
control
would
have
been
to
land
us
in
hades
instead
of
lima
hour
after
hour
the
arid
savage
scenery
slid
upward
here
the
train
glided
serenely
along
on
the
bottomless
edge
of
things
now
and
again
we
came
out
directly
above
a
thousand
feet
above
a
dusty
town
with
rows
of
stones
laid
on
the
roofs
to
keep
them
from
escaping
such
dreary
surroundings
and
zigzagged
an
hour
often
on
six
tracks
one
above
the
other
down
to
it
only
to
continue
the
descent
as
swiftly
beyond
a
score
of
places
recalled
the
story
of
the
young
graduate
engineer
who
protested
to
the
american
whose
name
is
forever
linked
with
this
engineering
feat
why
meiggs
we
can
t
run
a
railroad
along
there
in
that
sliding
shale
can
t
eh
the
anecdote
continues
well
young
man
that
s
just
where
she
s
got
to
go
and
if
you
can
t
find
room
for
her
on
the
ground
we
ll
hang
her
from
bit
by
bit
the
andes
began
to
take
on
slight
touches
of
green
the
rimac
chattering
downward
toward
the
sea
gave
us
more
and
more
the
town
of
chosica
flashed
past
us
like
an
oasis
of
civilization
and
we
sped
in
truly
metropolitan
fashion
on
down
the
darkening
valley
surrounded
by
whole
mountains
of
broken
rock
tufts
of
cactus
and
a
few
hardy
willows
drinking
their
life
from
the
widening
stream
on
toward
the
glowing
sunset
and
into
the
black
night
electric
lights
real
lights
in
their
full
began
to
dot
the
darkness
then
flashed
past
us
throwing
their
insolent
glare
into
our
faces
the
roar
of
a
real
city
with
clanging
and
rumbling
wagons
rose
about
us
a
long
crowded
with
an
urban
throng
came
to
a
halt
beside
us
and
i
descended
in
the
thickness
of
the
summer
night
in
the
city
of
kings
three
miles
below
where
i
had
stepped
forth
that
morning
into
the
wintry
dawn
chapter
xiii
round
about
the
peruvian
capital
it
is
due
i
suppose
to
some
error
in
my
that
my
interest
in
any
given
corner
of
the
earth
fades
in
proportion
as
it
approaches
modern
civilization
and
easy
accessibility
to
your
incurable
vagabond
may
come
a
momentary
thrill
if
not
of
pleasure
at
least
of
contentment
with
the
feel
of
city
pavements
once
more
under
his
feet
after
long
hand
to
hand
combat
with
the
wilderness
and
the
knowledge
that
to
go
a
journey
he
has
only
to
signal
an
electric
on
the
nearest
corner
but
the
attraction
quickly
palls
visions
of
the
winding
trail
soon
begin
again
to
torture
him
with
their
solicitations
the
placid
ways
of
urban
man
take
on
a
drab
and
colorless
artificiality
and
once
more
the
realization
comes
that
to
him
life
offers
genuine
satisfaction
only
when
he
is
struggling
onward
toward
some
distant
and
possibly
unattainable
goal
such
a
place
is
lima
the
former
capital
of
spanish
america
has
to
be
sure
its
points
of
interest
old
colonial
palaces
where
the
shades
of
cloaked
viceroys
seem
still
to
linger
cloistered
walls
inclosing
the
tonsured
and
cowled
atmosphere
of
the
middle
ages
narrow
streets
with
long
vistas
of
overhanging
moorish
balconies
wherein
still
lurks
the
charm
of
other
days
but
these
things
are
all
but
buried
under
the
stereotyped
conveniences
and
commonplace
manners
of
the
modern
world
upon
the
romance
and
air
of
antiquity
of
a
spanish
city
of
long
ago
transplanted
to
this
sandy
coast
has
intruded
the
aggressive
urge
of
commerce
from
between
the
carved
mahogany
bars
of
quaint
peers
the
face
of
trade
in
and
out
of
massive
old
wooden
studded
with
brass
come
bales
of
merchandise
often
stacked
high
in
the
beautiful
patios
and
secluded
retreats
of
former
generations
here
for
the
first
time
in
south
america
were
rumors
of
strikes
and
complaints
of
the
servant
workmen
and
domestics
advanced
already
to
a
scale
of
wages
about
half
that
of
our
own
land
were
coming
more
and
more
to
a
knowledge
of
their
worth
and
power
their
striving
unfortunately
taking
that
form
of
careless
workmanship
and
insolence
here
for
the
first
time
the
militant
cost
of
living
weighed
down
on
the
mass
of
mankind
like
a
leaden
blanket
lima
s
thousand
and
one
do
none
of
them
seek
a
virgin
field
in
the
highlands
their
clients
with
the
mechanical
impersonality
of
world
capitals
like
the
population
these
show
that
absence
of
a
middle
class
characteristic
of
society
the
marked
contrast
of
the
great
bulk
of
sandaled
poor
rubbing
shoulders
with
faultless
parisian
attire
either
they
are
repulsive
workingmen
s
dumps
or
outwardly
regal
in
manner
and
inwardly
of
properties
where
nothing
national
and
unique
is
to
be
found
unless
it
be
some
rare
local
delicacy
such
as
de
leg
of
young
goat
whatever
exclusive
and
characteristic
remains
on
the
surface
is
grouped
in
and
about
the
great
covered
where
long
rows
of
strange
indigenous
and
familiar
foreign
wares
stretch
in
and
quaint
juxtaposition
or
hovers
about
a
few
surviving
customs
of
bygone
days
such
as
the
is
more
often
a
his
morning
round
astride
horse
or
mule
with
his
cans
hanging
like
from
between
his
legs
he
who
comes
down
upon
them
from
above
will
find
the
people
of
the
coast
more
vivacious
than
those
of
the
chilly
upper
andes
where
the
perennial
gauntness
of
nature
inclines
to
perpetual
gloom
the
limeño
has
been
likened
to
the
andalusian
in
his
fondness
for
dress
variety
and
dissipation
in
his
gaiety
and
quickness
of
wit
his
open
frankness
and
tendency
to
extravagance
certainly
his
speech
has
the
lisp
of
do
copita
de
pi
co
señore
his
castilian
has
not
the
purity
of
that
of
bogotá
yet
his
gaiety
is
only
comparative
there
is
an
innate
gloominess
and
passive
pessimism
everywhere
in
south
american
society
that
can
not
but
strike
the
visitor
who
comes
direct
from
more
favored
lands
the
morose
indian
of
the
uplands
forms
a
scarcely
noticeable
part
of
the
population
of
lima
on
those
rare
occasions
when
he
comes
down
or
more
often
is
brought
as
a
conscript
to
serve
his
time
as
soldier
in
the
capital
he
often
falls
quick
victim
to
the
white
plague
which
finds
easy
in
the
disused
cells
of
his
overdeveloped
lungs
built
for
the
scant
thin
air
of
the
sierra
the
cholo
or
mestizo
commonly
of
a
lesser
percentage
of
aboriginal
than
of
spanish
blood
makes
up
the
bulk
of
the
population
then
there
is
the
bred
of
the
intermingling
of
the
indian
and
negro
a
robust
stubborn
and
revengeful
fellow
merchants
from
all
the
varying
nationalities
of
europe
keep
shop
side
by
side
with
an
intermingling
of
turks
and
even
more
distant
races
and
american
engineers
stride
through
the
streets
at
all
hours
of
the
day
yet
lima
is
essentially
a
city
for
all
that
where
the
pallid
waxy
complexion
of
the
gente
decente
is
much
in
evidence
the
women
of
this
caste
are
often
beautiful
so
for
that
matter
are
the
men
in
a
population
that
may
almost
be
termed
cosmopolitan
the
chinaman
holds
a
considerable
place
after
the
abolition
of
slavery
in
large
numbers
of
coolies
were
imported
for
the
plantations
of
the
peruvian
coast
and
celestials
of
higher
caste
have
since
taken
advantage
of
peru
s
policy
and
the
japanese
steamship
lines
so
that
there
are
temples
and
and
opium
dens
in
lima
and
men
in
european
dress
who
are
not
europeans
lean
in
the
doorways
of
old
colonial
mansions
transformed
into
oriental
shops
the
chinese
of
lima
occupy
a
wider
field
of
activity
than
almost
anywhere
else
in
the
western
hemisphere
not
only
is
a
large
percentage
of
the
retail
and
restaurant
business
in
their
hands
but
scores
of
herbists
we
might
say
have
stretched
their
signs
across
the
façades
and
blinded
miradores
of
what
were
in
viceregal
days
the
residences
of
haughty
families
only
the
old
men
still
cling
to
the
national
dress
and
the
pigtail
has
entirely
disappeared
here
too
the
chinaman
sinks
to
depths
not
familiar
to
us
of
the
north
and
not
only
does
the
race
furnish
many
of
the
of
the
capital
but
it
is
no
rare
sight
to
see
an
personification
of
poverty
hobbling
along
the
main
thoroughfares
shooting
snipes
in
the
gutters
the
masses
of
lima
dwell
in
which
are
none
the
less
tenements
for
being
packed
together
on
the
ground
floor
along
either
side
of
narrow
blind
alleys
in
which
all
the
activities
of
the
household
from
baby
s
bath
to
the
worship
of
a
tin
virgin
intermingle
instead
of
being
piled
one
above
the
other
the
better
houses
are
spacious
and
airy
within
though
outwardly
monotonous
built
of
mud
and
cane
and
plaster
their
façades
here
resembling
marble
at
a
distance
there
painted
pale
blue
or
pink
or
yellow
in
the
cathedral
the
most
imposing
in
appearance
in
spanish
america
the
mummified
skeleton
of
pizarro
the
jaws
wired
like
those
of
some
prehistoric
creature
in
a
museum
is
made
a
after
the
crude
spanish
fashion
the
cine
has
all
but
driven
out
the
theater
and
whatever
of
national
or
racial
the
latter
brought
with
it
the
visitor
who
knows
no
spanish
could
easily
guess
the
business
of
a
shop
announcing
itself
a
plomería
y
the
lima
barber
calling
his
establishment
a
peluquería
y
perfumería
leaves
no
doubt
as
to
what
effeminate
fate
may
befall
one
who
ventures
into
his
den
this
season
of
july
and
august
they
say
is
no
time
to
see
lima
at
its
best
the
traveler
who
has
been
a
thousand
times
assured
that
rain
never
falls
on
the
coast
of
peru
will
be
astonished
to
find
the
streets
often
slimy
and
soaking
wet
with
the
scotch
mist
that
turns
everything
clammy
and
chill
yet
never
reaches
the
point
where
the
shops
find
it
worth
while
to
include
umbrellas
among
their
stock
for
days
and
even
weeks
the
sun
is
invisible
and
the
capital
lies
heavy
under
leaden
skies
and
a
muggy
blanket
of
mist
cold
dank
and
gloomy
that
is
a
rare
day
in
this
season
when
a
brilliant
sun
makes
it
worth
while
to
climb
san
cristobal
hill
a
bare
peaked
pyramid
rising
close
above
lima
on
the
north
from
which
he
who
has
chosen
his
time
well
may
catch
a
view
not
only
of
callao
and
its
island
framed
by
the
intense
blue
of
the
pacific
but
of
the
snowclads
of
the
sierra
the
city
with
its
inhabitants
lies
flat
in
its
arid
setting
the
disk
of
the
in
the
foreground
an
irregular
triangle
with
its
base
resting
on
the
babbling
rimac
without
chimneys
almost
without
for
its
industries
are
still
chiefly
confined
to
handicraft
the
red
tiles
that
give
the
prevailing
color
to
the
cities
of
the
andes
are
here
unknown
the
roofs
made
of
sticks
and
mud
are
flat
like
those
of
palestine
and
are
the
family
promenades
and
and
the
abode
of
smaller
live
stock
especially
of
roosters
whose
raucous
saluting
of
each
new
day
is
not
to
be
escaped
by
the
most
fortunate
resident
is
still
the
most
popular
sport
of
the
cholo
classes
it
is
impossible
to
appear
in
public
without
being
pestered
by
a
constant
procession
of
or
of
who
fill
the
streets
with
their
bawling
from
morning
for
lima
is
no
early
midnight
for
all
its
modern
aspect
lima
is
still
in
temperament
dawn
brings
to
light
personal
habits
little
less
reprehensible
than
those
of
quito
a
package
of
films
mailed
from
the
united
states
cost
me
two
days
of
at
the
and
the
charges
exceeded
the
original
cost
a
dozen
bags
of
mail
from
the
north
were
lost
in
callao
harbor
through
the
inexcusable
carelessness
of
the
bargemen
the
government
refused
to
make
reparation
to
the
addressees
on
the
ground
that
the
law
relieved
it
of
responsibility
for
unavoidable
losses
by
shipwreck
an
abortive
revolution
enlivened
the
last
days
of
july
strolling
into
the
plaza
one
evening
i
was
jostled
by
a
group
of
youthful
roughs
firing
revolvers
into
the
air
as
they
went
that
night
the
mob
assaulted
the
home
of
a
former
president
with
casualties
of
three
killed
and
a
dozen
wounded
and
the
executive
of
a
year
before
was
lodged
in
a
cell
at
the
penitentiary
yet
the
films
at
a
cine
a
block
away
ran
on
without
a
tremor
and
but
for
the
fact
that
the
shops
took
down
their
shutters
somewhat
later
than
usual
there
was
nothing
left
next
morning
to
recall
the
occurrence
a
few
days
later
the
principal
newspaper
announced
solemnly
that
the
had
gone
to
panama
for
motives
of
the
national
museum
was
officially
open
though
unofficially
closed
on
the
day
of
my
visit
but
the
experienced
traveler
can
always
win
his
point
with
the
doorkeeper
of
a
south
american
institution
and
i
was
soon
treading
the
resounding
halls
between
lines
of
a
dead
world
s
relics
mummies
from
prehistoric
days
their
knees
drawn
up
to
their
chins
a
look
half
of
disgust
half
of
pain
on
their
osseous
features
squatted
along
a
wall
some
were
still
covered
with
wrappings
enclosing
in
clumsy
bundles
not
merely
their
bodies
but
all
their
possessions
their
protruding
heads
still
in
fantastic
masks
and
wigs
just
as
they
had
been
found
in
the
burial
caves
of
the
sierra
others
reputed
incas
were
contained
in
huge
bales
in
which
they
stood
erect
as
befitted
their
high
caste
their
heads
unmasked
the
whole
covered
with
a
cloth
the
floor
of
one
large
room
was
completely
covered
with
hundreds
of
skulls
in
careful
rows
some
showed
prehistoric
trepanning
irregular
holes
sawed
out
of
them
and
the
subsequent
growth
of
the
bone
proving
that
the
warrior
had
lived
long
after
his
overthrow
in
battle
a
drowsy
cholo
was
breaking
up
skeletons
and
clawing
earth
out
of
skulls
with
the
expressionless
placidity
with
which
he
might
have
sorted
potatoes
the
director
deigned
to
show
me
in
person
through
the
gallery
of
paintings
we
paused
first
before
an
immense
canvas
depicting
the
funeral
of
atahuallpa
a
modern
work
i
remarked
merely
to
make
conversation
no
no
señor
replied
the
director
vehemently
that
is
antigua
it
was
painted
nearly
forty
years
the
fat
priest
is
valverde
i
suppose
and
this
man
with
a
beard
must
be
pizarro
just
so
señor
and
the
man
behind
is
pizarro
s
brother
his
brother
illustration
the
lottery
drawing
in
the
main
plaza
of
lima
two
of
the
men
who
turn
the
hollow
spheres
are
blind
and
the
boys
who
thrust
in
a
hand
to
draw
out
a
number
are
supposedly
below
the
age
of
corruption
illustration
all
aboard
a
sunday
excursion
that
was
not
posed
but
was
snapped
just
as
it
came
along
the
road
near
pachacámac
on
the
peruvian
coast
but
the
director
persisted
in
the
unhistorical
relationship
in
which
he
was
confirmed
by
an
assistant
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
figure
in
question
represented
a
man
some
fifteen
years
younger
than
the
chief
conquistador
why
is
the
back
of
almagro
s
head
missing
ah
señor
sighed
the
director
with
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
what
would
you
the
chilians
cut
out
this
picture
and
carried
it
home
it
used
to
be
several
feet
longer
and
there
were
many
other
caballeros
in
the
among
whom
was
the
real
almagro
no
doubt
i
made
the
circuit
of
the
gallery
then
turned
an
inquiring
eye
on
my
companion
are
looking
for
the
picture
that
used
to
be
here
he
stammered
quick
to
catch
my
expression
yes
the
famous
portrait
of
well
it
used
to
hang
right
here
said
the
director
pointing
to
a
blank
space
on
the
wall
as
at
some
object
of
extraordinary
interest
but
a
few
weeks
ago
the
señor
presidente
de
la
república
sent
for
it
because
he
wants
it
in
his
own
on
my
return
i
dropped
in
at
the
university
of
san
marcos
oldest
in
america
and
antedating
our
most
ancient
by
nearly
a
century
it
was
pitifully
like
other
schools
the
rector
having
led
me
through
a
dozen
empty
grouped
about
several
patios
and
having
given
the
history
in
detail
of
a
collection
of
silver
cups
graciously
awarded
the
university
by
the
king
of
this
and
the
emperor
of
that
expressed
unbounded
surprise
that
i
should
wish
to
see
a
class
at
work
when
it
became
evident
that
he
could
not
shake
me
off
with
babbling
courtesies
he
pointed
out
the
door
of
a
class
in
law
and
disappeared
as
if
he
would
not
have
it
known
who
was
responsible
for
the
unusual
intrusion
some
young
men
not
so
young
either
being
almost
all
adorned
with
mustaches
were
lounging
on
benches
of
the
amphitheater
the
professor
comfortably
seated
in
a
sort
of
pulpit
was
reading
in
a
languid
and
utterly
dispassionate
a
lecture
he
had
himself
prepared
but
from
a
book
purchasable
at
a
dollar
or
two
and
readable
i
trust
by
the
students
themselves
meanwhile
the
students
napped
wrote
letters
exchanged
jokes
and
discussed
with
their
neighbors
the
extraordinary
advent
of
a
stranger
in
their
midst
no
doubt
they
had
some
other
means
and
place
of
acquiring
the
knowledge
indispensable
even
to
a
south
american
lawyer
but
what
they
gained
by
attending
classes
was
hard
to
guess
i
had
been
the
object
of
curiosity
for
some
time
before
the
professor
caught
sight
of
me
he
left
off
reading
at
once
and
sparred
for
time
with
a
string
of
stale
pedagogical
jokes
until
i
saw
fit
to
remove
my
annoying
presence
other
demonstrated
that
famous
old
san
marcos
is
still
in
the
world
of
long
ago
its
methods
of
instruction
as
antiquated
as
its
heritages
of
a
jesuitical
past
unavoidably
so
because
of
the
rarity
of
spanish
translations
of
modern
works
during
all
july
my
ambition
remained
at
a
low
ebb
and
my
most
extended
acquaintance
was
with
the
medical
profession
yu
sui
herbolario
de
pekin
physician
extraordinary
to
his
excellency
the
chinese
minister
assured
me
i
had
dysentery
but
no
fever
and
concocted
the
daily
bottle
of
herbs
accordingly
the
chief
italian
specialist
based
his
treatment
on
the
fact
that
i
had
fever
but
no
dysentery
fortunately
lima
has
not
yet
been
invaded
by
that
sect
that
would
have
robbed
me
of
the
gloomy
pleasure
of
having
anything
every
gringo
who
had
ever
ventured
a
hundred
miles
into
the
interior
had
his
own
individual
sure
cure
and
i
had
reached
the
point
where
i
would
have
worn
a
tin
charm
about
my
neck
had
anyone
asserted
it
efficacious
yet
when
once
i
had
discovered
a
real
physician
in
blood
and
of
tropical
experience
the
injections
of
quickly
effective
a
no
less
potent
factor
in
the
recovery
however
was
the
hospitality
of
mine
own
people

of

genuine
sped
across
the
cool
flat
country
in
a
brief
from
the
capital
to
the
edge
of
the
pacific
i
had
not
seen
since
landing
in
cartagena
thirteen
months
before
here
it
was
often
brilliant
summer
and
from
the
housetop
promenade
spread
out
all
callao
harbor
jutting
la
punta
and
the
island
of
san
lorenzo
in
their
intense
blue
setting
and
perhaps
even
the
line
of
the
sierra
while
over
the
capital
a
bare
eight
miles
away
hung
the
opaque
blanket
of
haze
and
gloom
the
beach
was
near
at
hand
the
constant
and
the
soporific
roar
of
the
surf
never
silent
the
landscape
flat
and
arid
had
a
charm
of
its
own
and
a
network
of
mud
fences
on
the
broad
tops
of
which
one
might
promenade
for
miles
one
sunday
during
convalescence
i
visited

pachacámac
swift
interurban
cars
bore
us
through
miraflores
and
barranco
to
chorillos
proudest
of
the
rainless
peruvian
coast
where
we
mounted
horses
and
rode
away
into
the
desert
by
a
broad
trail
that
paralleled
the
shore
within
hearing
of
the
dull
roll
of
the
surf
it
was
a
veritable
sahara
in
which
the
sand
everywhere
lay
in
ridges
the
horizon
rose
before
us
as
at
sea
and
the
mirage
of
seemed
rivers
flowing
landward
the
uncorrected
imagination
is
wont
to
picture
the
coast
of
peru
as
utterly
flat
as
well
as
sandy
it
is
so
only
in
part
hills
of
sand
that
were
almost
mountains
stretched
down
to
the
sea
like
buttresses
fashioned
to
support
the
mammoth
wall
of
the
andes
that
bounded
the
horizon
on
the
left
the
summits
of
many
were
hidden
in
mists
the
garúa
from
which
had
given
life
to
the
brilliant
green
and
patches
where
flocks
feed
in
certain
seasons
and
the
smiling
valley
of
lurín
watered
by
a
stream
smaller
than
the
rimac
and
still
cold
from
the
snows
above
was
as
inviting
in
its
contrast
to
the
repulsive
naked
hills
as
any
desert
oasis
down
on
the
floor
of
the
valley
this
too
seemed
sandy
and
dry
but
the
that
still
water
it
as
in
the
days
of
the
incas
sustain
a
wilderness
of
scrubby
trees
among
which
a
chiefly
negro
population
lolls
in
huts
nature
seems
to
have
arranged
her
seasons
with
foresight
here
for
when
the
garúa
gives
way
to
blazing
summer
the
rainy
season
and
the
melting
snows
above
swell
the
rivers
to
a
volume
that
affords
widespread
irrigation
pachacámac
the
animator
of
the
universe
not
to
be
confused
with
the
of
the
incas
had
his
temple
on
the
edge
of
this
forbidding
waste
of
sand
overlooking
the
sea
that
chafes
incessantly
at
its
feet
it
was
the
benares
of
the
ancient
peruvians
not
merely
because
it
drew
pilgrims
from
all
the
surrounding
world
but
because
here
those
who
could
brought
and
disposed
of
their
dead
conquered
by
the
incas
nearly
two
centuries
before
the
coming
of
the
spaniards
a
temple
of
the
sun
was
added
but
the
like
their
conquerors
in
turn
were
too
politic
to
suppress
the
earlier
religion
entirely
and
merely
merged
it
with
their
own
in
a
room
closely
shut
and
stinking
says
estete
the
spanish
chronicler
was
an
idol
made
of
wood
very
dirty
which
they
called
god
who
creates
and
sustains
us
it
was
held
in
great
veneration
and
at
its
feet
were
different
indeed
from
many
an
andean
place
of
worship
it
is
a
place
of
death
in
a
double
sense
scuttling
lizards
and
are
the
only
forms
of
life
that
accentuate
its
silent
repulsive
sterility
human
skulls
kick
about
underfoot
through
all
the
extent
of
the
ruins
and
disintegrated
skeletons
lie
everywhere
only
the
earthen
pots
and
are
of
financial
value
to
the
looters
the
heads
of
the
men
who
made
them
are
not
worth
the
gathering
the
ruins
are
extensive
a
few
of
the
great
terraced
temples
still
moderately
well
preserved
but
being
of
clay
or
adobe
dreary
they
offer
no
contrast
in
color
to
the
surrounding
desert
hills
and
nothing
to
compare
with
the
splendid
monuments
of
those
wonderful
architects
the
ancient
peruvians
of
the
highlands
the
year
had
run
over
into
september
before
i
turned
my
face
upward
again
toward
the
sierra
to
pick
up
the
broken
thread
of
my
journey
beyond
chosica
the
naked
hills
closed
in
and
the
train
climbed
all
day
between
barren
echoing
walls
of
rock
the
exhilarating
mountain
air
cutting
ever
deeper
into
my
lungs
as
the
glorious
italian
skies
of
the
cloudless
upper
plateau
spread
their
canopy
above
snow
appeared
on
peaks
descended
to
meet
us
and
spread
in
patches
about
and
below
us
as
the
air
thinned
our
faces
flushed
and
tingled
a
tendency
to
sleepiness
was
succeeded
by
a
feeling
of
exhilaration
and
an
inclination
to
grow
talkative
my
began
to
show
signs
of
distress
at
the
altitude
growing
more
and
more
with
bloodshot
eyes
then
one
by
one
they
frankly
succumbed
to
mountain
sickness
as
the
train
continued
inexorably
upward
as
the
experienced
sailor
struts
about
among
his
seasick
fellows
so
i
caught
myself
gazing
with
haughty
scorn
upon
the
weaklings
about
me
obviously
a
man
who
had
tramped
the
lofty
páramos
from
bogotá
often
under
a
heavy
pack
was
immune
to
any
effects
of
altitude
but
there
is
imbedded
in
ancient
literature
something
to
the
effect
that
pride
is
often
closely
attended
by
a
downfall
at
ticlio
in
the
crisp
cold
afternoon
i
noted
that
the
mere
exertion
of
lifting
my
baggage
from
the
main
to
the
train
set
my
heart
in
a
strange
flutter
a
more
cautious
person
too
would
not
have
drunk
three
cups
of
black
coffee
in
the
miserable
little
station
so
soon
after
weeks
of
rigid
diet
laboriously
we
climbed
to
the
highest
railroad
point
in
the
world
flanked
by
an
immense
blue
glacier
up
again
on
the
bare
treeless
silent
pampas
among
hovels
and
ichu
the
stolid
expressionless
indians
of
the
highlands
and
drew
up
at
dusk
in
morococha
the
cheerless
more
than
three
miles
above
the
sea
lay
scattered
along
a
dreary
valley
with
a
vista
of
three
cold
lagoons
across
which
the
enclosing
snowclads
threw
their
violet
evening
shadows
in
this
breathless
region
my
pulse
started
savagely
at
every
exertion
but
being
already
arrived
i
supposed
myself
as
safe
from
mountain
sickness
as
a
disembarking
passenger
from
mal
de
mer
in
the
manager
s
cozy
quarters
the
blazing
fireplace
with
its
unaccustomed
artificial
heat
and
its
clouds
of
threatened
suffocation
and
forced
me
to
step
out
frequently
into
the
crisp
night
air
to
catch
my
breath
but
no
indian
of
the
highland
could
have
boasted
himself
in
finer
physical
spirits
when
we
wandered
away
toward
ten
panting
considerably
to
be
sure
even
at
a
very
moderate
pace
up
the
slope
to
the
superintendent
s
dwelling
barely
had
i
turned
in
however
when
i
began
gasping
for
breath
within
an
hour
my
host
found
that
i
had
a
respiration
of
and
a
pulse
of
all
night
long
i
struggled
with
the
sound
of
an
accelerated
in
bad
repair
my
heart
engaged
in
what
promised
to
be
a
successful
attempt
to
pound
its
way
out
through
my
back
until
my
very
ached
and
all
the
valley
of
morococha
seemed
to
echo
with
its
thumping
it
was
too
much
to
be
scarcely
recovered
from
one
long
laborious
andean
ailment
only
to
blow
up
of
my
own
steam
in
this
absurd
land
in
the
morning
the
came
with
his
stethescope
mumbled
soroche
in
a
weary
unsympathetic
voice
left
some
pills
and
instructions
and
was
gone
all
day
long
i
lay
fasting
the
snowclads
gazing
down
upon
me
with
icy
andean
indifference
gradually
the
pounding
of
my
heart
ceased
to
drown
out
all
other
sounds
and
my
lungs
resumed
their
accustomed
action
on
the
following
morning
though
still
weak
and
aching
from
crown
to
toe
i
was
able
to
be
about
the
day
after
i
strode
slowly
about
the
camp
with
something
of
the
vigor
in
the
end
the
experience
seemed
to
be
advantageous
for
with
every
day
thereafter
i
advanced
to
a
faultless
physical
condition
that
was
to
accompany
me
on
all
the
rest
of
the
journey
there
are
a
score
of
theories
concerning
this
known
throughout
peru
by
the
quichua
word
and
in
the
basin
of
the
titicaca
as
who
may
be
subject
to
it
what
will
prevent
it
whether
or
not
previous
experience
will
or
will
not
give
immunity
are
even
greater
mysteries
than
those
surrounding
its
prototype
the
bugbear
of
ocean
travel
no
two
persons
are
ever
affected
alike
by
it
commonly
it
is
accompanied
by
a
raging
headache
all
foreigners
contracted
for
mine
employment
in
this
region
are
subjected
to
a
rigid
physical
examination
before
they
ascend
the
hill
yet
it
is
not
unusual
to
make
up
a
special
train
and
rush
a
victim
down
to
the
coast
among
horses
with
which
it
takes
the
form
of
and
often
renders
the
animal
unfit
for
further
service
it
is
known
as
from
the
aboriginal
superstition
that
it
is
caused
by
veins
of
ore
vetas
in
the
earth
morococha
like
its
rival
cerro
de
pasco
is
a
little
world
of
its
own
exclusively
mining
in
its
raison
d
être
and
considerably
marked
by
influence
though
many
of
the
natives
still
huddle
in
dismal
huts
without
windows
and
with
dirt
floors
the
civilizing
effect
of
the
gringo
is
in
some
evidence
at
least
in
those
superficial
matters
of
small
habits
amusements
and
clothing
american
boots
are
almost
as
frequently
worn
by
the
indian
men
as
the
or
hairy
cowhide
sandal
bitter
cold
though
it
is
even
at
noonday
the
indians
of
female
persuasion
go
scantily
clad
and
almost
universally
barefoot
the
miners
work
nine
hours
a
day
seven
days
a
week
and
receive
an
average
of
something
more
than
a
dollar
a
high
wage
from
the
andean
indian
point
of
view
the
considerable
efficiency
of
both
indian
and
cholo
workmen
is
curtailed
by
much
and
hard
drinking
following
each
and
during
the
many
fiestas
a
majority
of
the
native
miners
go
on
an
extended
debauch
leaving
the
mines
often
so
that
operations
virtually
cease
the
effect
of
the
celebration
does
not
wear
off
for
several
days
so
that
enterprise
is
commonly
paralyzed
a
week
or
more
in
every
month
the
company
is
powerless
to
remedy
this
drawback
and
the
scapegoat
of
all
imperfections
throughout
south
no
disposition
to
better
conditions
even
were
it
possible
an
indian
injured
in
the
mine
is
more
apt
to
run
away
than
to
report
at
the
hospital
and
to
appear
later
as
a
litigant
against
the
company
with
government
aid
frequently
sinecure
for
life
even
when
the
injured
man
is
attended
by
the
and
his
broken
leg
bound
with
splints
or
his
wound
properly
treated
with
antiseptic
care
he
is
likely
to
be
found
next
morning
with
the
bandages
torn
off
and
with
coca
leaves
or
a
chicken
leg
or
something
as
efficacious
substituted
it
must
be
admitted
that
his
gringo
superiors
do
not
set
the
native
miner
a
perfect
example
in
his
chief
vice
the
excessive
consumption
of
alcohol
in
the
social
vacuum
that
must
necessarily
exist
in
such
a
community
drinking
and
gambling
are
the
favorite
methods
of
putting
to
rout
dull
care
the
altitude
soon
gets
on
the
nerves
seeming
to
call
for
some
such
stimulant
at
least
it
is
the
custom
to
lay
to
the
altitude
any
species
of
misdemeanor
or
the
formation
of
habits
unknown
to
the
subject
before
his
arrival
somehow
it
strikes
the
passing
observer
as
wicked
to
send
these
men
of
other
climes
up
here
to
gasp
through
life
at
a
height
fitted
only
to
the
indian
and
his
of
burden
the
llama
both
physically
and
temperamentally
the
effect
of
the
altitude
is
curious
water
boils
at
so
low
a
temperature
that
a
finger
can
almost
be
thrust
into
it
with
impunity
fireplaces
are
set
in
action
by
nonchalantly
throwing
two
or
three
of
kerosene
into
the
blaze
those
accustomed
to
the
heights
for
generations
are
far
sturdier
and
less
vivacious
than
those
of
lower
levels
newcomers
on
the
other
hand
are
easily
excited
and
dashing
about
like
the
proverbial
hen
with
its
head
cut
off
futile
in
proportion
to
their
striving
in
the
gringo
community
it
is
a
standing
jest
that
the
american
or
englishman
most
phlegmatic
at
will
spend
an
hour
trying
to
shave
and
grow
so
over
that
simple
task
that
he
often
gives
up
in
despair
the
exhilaration
is
physical
as
well
as
mental
baseball
players
far
from
losing
their
customary
prowess
in
this
thin
air
are
given
to
running
their
legs
off
in
their
excitement
and
must
often
be
restrained
lest
they
burst
their
lungs
it
is
asserted
that
after
a
few
months
in
the
mines
it
is
not
safe
to
open
a
bottle
or
a
in
the
presence
of
a
minister
s
son
unfortunately
the
jest
seems
to
have
serious
basis
in
fact
the
tighter
the
lines
that
bound
their
youth
the
more
completely
do
the
newcomers
cast
them
off
when
removed
from
the
influence
of
home
ties
and
neighborly
opinion
small
wonder
the
latin
races
accuse
the
of
hypocrisy
the
americans
who
live
and
mine
up
and
down
the
sierra
have
convinced
peruvians
that
every
living
american
drinks
quarts
of
whiskey
neat
every
day
and
squanders
his
substance
in
gambling
or
if
luck
runs
his
way
in
the
stews
of
lima
this
is
not
to
say
that
all
gringos
in
morococha
and
cerro
de
pasco
fall
into
an
evil
manner
of
life
or
that
there
are
not
many
more
who
perform
their
tasks
fully
and
efficiently
in
spite
of
an
occasional
debauch
those
who
bring
with
them
very
strong
wills
or
some
equivalent
for
them
retain
the
tautness
of
their
moral
fiber
for
all
the
altitude
the
percentage
of
men
who
go
astray
is
such
however
that
it
becomes
almost
a
subject
for
congratulation
to
see
a
frame
and
a
wholesome
unlined
face
in
these
andean
communities
where
dissipated
countenances
are
rather
the
rule
than
the
exception
then
too
often
arriving
as
youths
with
little
experience
of
life
except
the
one
of
our
colleges
the
younger
seem
to
feel
it
necessary
to
prove
themselves
men
and
to
keep
up
the
local
reputation
for
what
a
missionary
referred
to
as
those
rough
mining
fellows
by
assuming
a
bold
gruff
even
vulgar
exterior
all
question
of
morality
aside
the
mere
materialistic
problem
of
keeping
up
the
efficiency
of
their
force
would
seem
to
make
some
curtailment
of
the
prevailing
customs
worth
the
trouble
of
the
but
even
those
sent
down
to
assume
charge
too
often
fall
victims
to
that
false
philosophy
of
a
short
life
and
a
merry
gringo
employees
of
higher
rank
command
generous
salaries
and
are
well
housed
with
all
the
comforts
that
can
conveniently
be
transported
to
this
lofty
region
coming
for
the
most
part
directly
from
england
or
the
united
states
they
take
naturally
to
the
artificial
heat
which
the
natives
rarely
adopt
before
the
fireplace
at
the
club
the
conversation
jumps
from
bridge
to
tetrahydrite
ore
and
back
again
to
poker
with
to
the
layman
a
vertiginous
speed
amid
the
rattle
of
glasses
and
bottles
and
the
strains
of
a
tireless
phonograph
a
considerable
portion
of
the
talk
might
frankly
be
called
gossip
for
south
america
has
this
in
common
with
small
towns
that
every
gringo
up
and
down
the
continent
knows
every
other
at
least
by
hearsay
his
private
character
and
his
domestic
difficulties
the
traveler
through
south
america
is
frequently
struck
by
the
fact
that
large
enterprises
even
british
in
ownership
are
more
often
than
not
actually
and
practically
in
charge
of
americans
the
manager
and
most
of
the
office
force
may
be
english
but
the
actual
motive
power
the
man
who
makes
the
ore
fly
or
sets
the
trains
to
running
is
apt
to
be
a
youthful
superintendent
or
engineer
but
a
few
years
out
of
one
of
our
technical
colleges
this
is
no
argument
for
or
against
the
mentality
or
ability
of
either
nationality
these
are
their
natural
spheres
of
action
purely
the
result
of
environment
the
american
coming
from
a
land
where
precedent
is
given
short
shrift
and
accustomed
to
furnish
his
own
initiative
is
best
fitted
for
pushing
the
pioneer
work
for
attacking
unprecedented
problems
and
carrying
the
enterprise
on
to
the
point
where
it
is
established
and
running
smoothly
the
englishman
product
of
an
older
and
more
settled
society
is
more
easily
content
to
continue
an
established
undertaking
to
stick
on
the
job
while
the
american
moves
on
to
attack
new
and
unfamiliar
problems

copper

up

us
through

opened
out

no

have

dropped

the
truly
romantic

of
course
would
have
been
to
buy
a
llama
to
bear
my

to
the
capital

ancient

but
however
in
keeping
with
the
local
color
that
prehistoric
denizen
of

might
have
been
there
were
at

a
score
of
cold
practical

reasons
why
he
was
not

of
them
such
as

of

uncompanionable
temperament

the
drawback
of
unattainability
for
the

i
have
this
in
our
wealth

not
unlimited
there
remained
however
an
animal
unknown
to
mankind
at
large
that
fitted
my
requirements
exactly
as
exactly
at
least
as
is
possible
in
this
imperfect
world
peruvian
imitation
of
a
horse
in
a
bare
three
centuries
this
descendent
of
our
fine

has
adapted
himself
to
andean
conditions
his
small
compact
hoofs
are
almost
as
sure
on
precarious
as
those
of
the
mule
he
is
gifted
with
an
uncomplaining
endurance
far
beyond
what
his
appearance
suggests
and
he
possesses
an
even
peaceful
temper
and
an
absence
of
ambition
and
personal
initiative
equal
to
his

moreover
he
is
capable
of
sustaining
life
and
strength
for
an
indefinite
period
on
the
sparse
and
hardy
vegetation
of
the
uplands
and

at
certain
seasons

of
a
modest
purse

owned
such
a
and
the
feast
of
his
patron
saint
being
near
at
hand
was
induced
to
sell
i
took
to
the
animal
at
first
sight
not
that
he
was
a
thing
of
beauty
in
his
shaggy
coat
of
shedding
but
it
was
this
very
air
of
unpretentious
modesty
and
unandean
sense
of
duty
over
mere
personal
appearance
that
won
my
instant
regard
here
surely
was
a
companion
who
would
keep
his
own
counsel
under
the
most
trying
circumstances
being
no
larger
than
a
large
donkey
he
was
nicely
fitted
to
the
modest
load
of
some
sixty
pounds
that
was
destined
to
represent
his
share
of
the
world
s
labor
not
merely
was
he
newly
shod
but
he
had
been
enjoying
the
unbroken
freedom
of
a
for
several
days
and
should
therefore
be
in
condition
to
hold
his
own
for
an
indefinite
period
provided
i
did
not
set
too
swift
a
pace
the
masculine
gender
was
an
asset
not
to
be
overlooked
not
merely
did
my
sense
of
chivalry
forbid
sentencing
any
member
of
the
other
sex
to
the
hardships
that
rumor
insisted
lay
before
us
but
once
they
had
been
surmounted
i
would
not
have
my
glory
smudged
by
the
possibility
of
a
mere
female
boasting
that
she
had
also
accomplished
the
feat
again
the
animal
had
never
been
fifty
miles
east
of
huancayo
and
i
am
of
those
who
find
no
pleasure
in
a
trip
with
a
companion
who
has
already
been
over
the
route
the
mere
nine
dollars
at
which
we
finally
came
to
terms
seemed
a
slight
equivalent
for
all
these
virtues
though
i
took
care
not
to
hint
that
impression
to
the
erstwhile
owner
the
matter
of
a
name
was
no
problem
at
all
even
the
peruvians
unconsciously
tacked
on
the
diminutive
as
often
as
they
referred
to
my
new
and
it
was
natural
that
i
should
have
instantly
dubbed
him
chusquito
relieved
of
the
necessity
of
being
my
own
packhorse
i
could
somewhat
increase
my
outfit
in
lima
i
had
acquired
a
with
and
attachments
that
closed
up
into
a
compact
kitchenette
about
six
inches
in

this
went

bottle
of
alcohol
that
could
be
filled
at
any
town

along
the

foxy
himself
whose
faults
as
every
gringo
up
and
down
the
andes
knows
do
not
include
a
lack
of
generosity
insisted
that
he
would
be
forced
to
throw
away
a
somewhat
worn
but
still
very
serviceable
rubber
poncho
unless
i
carried
it
off
and
this
with
my
poncho
from
quito
was
destined
to
shield
me
from
many
a
bitter
night
on
lofty
the
clothing
requisite
for
every
possible
variation
of
altitude
and
photographic
supplies
sufficient
to
avoid
the
of
local
authorities
made
up
the
bulk
of
my
alforjas
then
there
was
room
for
a
native
and
a
foreign
book
for
a
of
pisco
with
which
to
win
the
esteem
of
isolated
indians
a
bag
of
cocoa
leaves
and
the
accompanying
lime
to
sustain
such
estimation
a
candle
for
the
endless
andean
evenings
and
a
sufficient
supply
of
imperishable
foodstuffs
to
relieve
my
mind
of
the
harassing
daily
preoccupation
of
finding
hospitality
before
dark
even
my
coat
and
kodak
could
be
hung
on
the
pack
leaving
me
free
to
stride
lazily
along
dressed
in
my
and
a
cynical
smile
it
was
the
tenth
day
of
september
when
i
creaked
my
hobnailed
way
out
of
huancayo
s
interminable
street
my
only
load
the
end
of
a
that
tempered
chusquito
s
pace
to
my
own
at
the
principal
his
former
owner
drank
my
health
in
pisco
and
though
he
shed
no
tear
it
might
easily
have
made
a
clean
mark
down
his
cheek
of
the
road
to
cuzco
i
knew
nothing
except
that
it
led
through
four
cities
and
that
i
should
never
reach
much
less
bring
my
companion
to
the
end
of
a
journey
on
which
not
even
a
son
of
the
country
would
venture
himself
without
a
guide
and
a
of
mules
and
arrieros
for
myself
i
had
no
misgivings
as
to
chusquito
i
trusted
to
frequent
halts
and
a
militant
attitude
that
should
win
him
an
unaccustomed
wealth
of
fodder
to
confound
the
pessimists
all
huancayo
gazed
after
me
from
their
doorways
with
a
mixture
of
astonishment
and
incredulity
as
i
set
out
now
is
it
not
strange
when
walking
is
the
first
and
indeed
the
only
natural
means
of
locomotion
that
people
who
look
with
complacency
upon
men
on
horseback
and
upon
trains
men
who
have
heard
of
automobiles
and
aëroplanes
should
gasp
with
wonder
to
see
a
man
journeying
afoot
and
that
may
go
about
living
on
the
country
and
gathering
certificates
from
every
possible
source
to
prove
they
do
walk
as
if
there
were
any
virtue
in
that
action
except
the
purely
personal
pleasure
of
it
or
nothing
even
the
burden
of
the
did
not
last
long
chusquito
being
an
experienced
i
soon
found
could
be
left
to
his
own
devices
in
his
own
country
he
knew
fully
as
well
as
i
how
to
climb
up
and
down
rocky
mountain
trails
and
if
he
showed
a
tendency
now
and
then
to
wander
off
across
the
pampa
especially
at
sight
of
some
of
his
own
kindred
it
was
natural
that
he
should
have
been
somewhat
bored
at
merely
human
companionship
within
two
days
we
were
strolling
along
like
lifelong
friends
at
an
even
gait
that
never
called
for
cudgel
acceleration
and
i
journeyed
as
serenely
as
if
i
had
found
at
last
that
automatic
baggage
of
which
i
had
so
long
dreamed
only
subconsciously
aware
that
my
possessions
were
marching
peacefully
before
me
the
mind
ran
unbidden
over
the
many
improvements
that
might
be
added
tent
and
more
supplies
or
i
might
even
become
an
itinerant
photographer
or
peddler
and
earn
my
way
as
i
went
instead
of
greeting
with
disdainful
silence
the
frequent
question
qué
lleva
de
venta
but
on
one
point
i
was
quickly
disillusioned
somehow
i
had
pictured
a
as
simply
a
perambulating
chest
of
drawers
fancying
that
i
had
merely
to
hang
my
possessions
on
the
animal
s
back
snatching
up
anything
as
i
chanced
to
need
it
whereas
in
real
life
i
found
that
everything
must
be
made
snug
and
tight
and
secured
by
the
intricate
that
made
it
as
inaccessible
on
the
march
as
if
it
had
been
left
behind
at
pucará
where
the
great
valley
of
the
huancas
narrows
and
begins
to
squeeze
the

upward
the
inhabitants
were
killing
a
cow
and
stringing
it
up
between
two
trees
in
the
center
of
the
plaza
all
the
beef
that
could
not
be
disposed
of
on
the
spot
was
cut
into

a

left
to
dry
in

this
treatment

it

is
scarce
or
treated
to
the
same
process
and
pork
is
of
hebraic
rarity
besides
the
traveler
who
longs
for
a
rasher
of
crisp
bacon
is
more
easily
content
to
assuage
his
appetite
in
beef
when
experience
has
taught
him
what
the
pigs
of
the
andes
feed
on
there
was
no
public
in
pucará
a
party
of
a
dozen
men
and
women
however
all
more
or
less
gay
with
pisco
were
glad
of
assistance
in
making
away
with
their
share
in
the
weekly
killing
i
tied
chusquito
before
a
bundle
of
wheat
straw
at
a
corner
of
the
plaza
and
we
crowded
around
a
table
in
a
neighboring
mud
room
and
dined
amid
an
uproar
of
maudlin
hilarity
and
a
series
of
stories
often
of
a
distinctly
raw
nature
in
which
the
females
easily
held
their
own
here
or
toasted
ripe
shelled
corn
did
duty
as
bread
and
each
helping
of
beef
was
flanked
by
boiled
or
small
frozen
potatoes
then
there
were
de
la
one
of
the
several
species
of
the
potato
family
unknown
in
other
lands
a
soft
sweetish
mushy
tuber
of
the
shape
of
a
large
peanut
which
it
was
à
la
mode
to
pick
from
the
plate
with
the
fingers
and
dip
before
each
bite
into
the
general
bowl
of
the
incaic
peppers
so
beloved
of
the
ancient
peruvians
as
in
all
peru
it
was
the
custom
here
to
drink
the
health
of
a
companion
and
expect
him
to
round
the
circle
ad
infinitum
et
intoxicatum
luckily
my
companions
were
so
far
gone
in
liquor
even
before
my
arrival
that
i
managed
to
avoid
most
of
the
fiery
copitas
without
giving
offense
in
the
group
was
the
cholo
of
the
fiscal
de
across
the
plaza
he
was
a
native
of
carhuáz
and
grew
so
excited
over
the
extraordinary
fact
that
i
had
not
only
been
in
his
birthplace
but
had
traveled
thence
by
land
that
irrespective
of
the
pisco
he
was
unable
to
begin
the
afternoon
session
when
the
boys
gathered
at
one
o
clock
it
didn
t
matter
anyway
he
confided
since
he
spoke
no
quichua
and
the
pupils
almost
no
spanish
and
he
would
get
his
the
government
had
the
he
pretended
to
teach
or
not
the
school
system
of
peru
being
centralized
like
that
of
france
orders
from
lima
sometimes
transfer
a
from
one
province
to
another
without
any
notion
as
to
whether
or
not
he
is
fitted
to
his
new
assignment
the
boys
all
but
one
of
whom
were
at
least
half
indian
could
mispronounce
a
few
sentences
from
the
lives
of
the
saints
but
few
could
recognize
one
letter
from
another
though
he
had
nothing
to
show
in
the
way
of
teaching
the
pointed
with
pride
to
the
in
huge
red
letters
all
but
covering
the
adobe
façade
as
an
example
of
his
handiwork
and
we
spent
an
hour
or
more
in
posing
the
school
for
a
group
in
the
act
of
saluting
the
national
flag
the
teacher
insisting
on
changing
his
brilliant
red
poncho
for
a
khaki
coat
before
he
would
face
the
kodak
and
of
course
he
grew
enraged
because
i
was
so
miserly
as
to
refuse
to
deliver
a
dozen
copies
of
the
picture
on
the
spot
another
round
of
copitas
restored
his
amiability
however
and
he
insisted
on
giving
me
something
not
to
forget
him
by
and
forced
upon
me
one
of
the
unvarnished
which
the
government
supplied
his
pupils
travelers
were
frequent
on
the
vast
rising
world
beyond
where
the
great
valley
of
the
huantas
shrivelled
and
disappeared
into
the
past
indian
women
trotted
by
not
only
with
a
load
and
a
baby
on
their
backs
but
often
suckling
the
infant
as
they
went
as
the
incas
called
goitre
was
common
driven
by
noiseless
indians
with
colored
rags
around
their
heads
under
their
thick
gray
felt
hats
passed
frequently
there
are
few
more
interesting
sights
than
that
afforded
by
two
of
these
trains
shuttling
through
each
other
on
a
narrow
mountain
trail
each
animal
keeping
its
course
as
unerringly
as
a
at
a
rocky
turn
of
the
road
one
of
the
frail
beasts
lay
dying
an
indian
boy
slashing
the
gay
ribbons
out
of
its
still
quivering
ears
with
a
crude
cutlass
chusquito
strongly
objected
to
passing
a
scene
so
fraught
with
the
dangers
and
cruelties
of
the
trail
it
was
our
first
real
difference
of
opinion
from
inca
days
it
seems
to
have
been
the
custom
to
decorate
the
ears
of
llamas
with
these
bits
of
bright
cloth
less
from
artistic
notions
than
as
a
means
of
designating
the
ownership
even
the
cows
bulls
goats
and
sheep
of
certain
regions
are
thus
with
ludicrous
results
when
as
here
the
matter
is
carried
so
far
as
to
beribbon
the
donkeys
it
seems
time
to
call
a
halt
for
what
can
look
more
absurdly
incongruous
than
a
plodding
ass
solemnly
waving
with
the
monotonous
rhythm
of
his
gait
his
gaily
bedecked
ears
beyond
marcavalle
on
the
second
day
the
stony
road
was
for
a
time
even
more
densely
populated
by
llama
donkey
and
by
haughty
gentry
ahorse
and
villagers
afoot
all
gente
arrieros
indians
of
both
sexes
and
one
could
almost
believe
the
very
or
stupid
with
drink
even
the
women
chewed
coca
each
bulging
cheek
suggesting
a
cud
of
tobacco
indian
women
that
is
for
in
a
land
where
every
man
rides
it
is
the
rarest
sight
to
see
a
woman
on
horseback
and
even
the
chola
who
drags
her
skirts
through
the
accumulations
of
years
in
her
native
hamlet
would
sooner
break
the
seventh
commandment
than
ride
astride
then
bit
by
bit
the
travel
died
out
the
single
telegraph
wire
strode
away
over
an
uninhabited
world
and
for
an
unbroken
half
day
we
tramped
across
a
vast
brown
pampa
with
only
an
occasional
flock
of
sheep
the
stone
and
straw
kennels
of
shepherds
at
so
great
a
distance
off
that
i
must
trust
as
usual
to
luck
in
guessing
aright
among
many
faint
paths
and
at
times
even
total
absence
thereof
the
indian
hamlet
of
nahuinpuquio
was
celebrating
some
church
holiday
the
air
pulsated
with
the
harsh
and
discordant
noise
of
fife
and
drum
in
the
melancholy
rhythm
of
all
music
of
the
aboriginals
and
the
drear
landscape
was
brightened
here
and
there
by
groups
of
dancers
indians
in
fantastic
costumes
and
ludicrous
masks
who
danced
in
fixed
spots
without
moving
a
yard
an
hour
in
any
direction
over
the
valleyed
and
rocky
face
of
the
mountain
beyond
a
bit
of
the
road
consisted
of
steps
that
may
have
been
part
of
the
old
inca
highway
then
the
trail
pitched
down
into
an
ever
warmer
valley
the
enclosing
hillsides
and
rocky
ranges
marked
off
in
hundreds
of
little
patches
most
of
them
newly
plowed
and
waiting
for
rain
toward
sunset
we
came
out
suddenly
above
a
river
brilliant
green
with
the
patches
of
verdure
stretching
along
it
as
far
as
the
eye
could
command
mantaro
racing
amazonward
through
its
gorge
with
villages
tucked
away
here
and
there
up
the
face
of
the
great
cliffs
that
rose
ever
higher
as
we
wound
forever
downward
round
and
round
the
headlands
in
the
parlor
of
the
hacienda
casma
where
were
prepared
for
three
travelers
whom
chance
had
brought
together
in
the
throat
of
the
valley
lay
piled
the
mail
virtually
new
american
the
unusually
noiseless
sincerity
of
our
host
and
the
extraordinary
order
of
his
establishment
surprised
me
not
a
little
until
i
learned
that
he
was
argentine
born
these
rural
haciendas
take
life
easily
it
was
nearly
eight
next
morning
before
we
drifted
together
for
coffee
bread
and
cheese
and
some
time
later
that
the
mayordomo
prevailed
upon
his
indian
assistants
to
drive
from
the
hacienda
pasture
a
score
of
mules
and
horses
from
which
we
each
chose
our
animals
while
i
sat
reading
in
the
fresh
june
morning
awaiting
my
companion
a
indian
slipped
noiselessly
into
the
yard
with
a
letter
which
the
wife
of
the
hacendado
opened
and
began
to
read
her
suppressed
laughter
soon
drew
the
attention
of
her
husband
who
having
taken
possession
of
the
epistle
began
in
his
turn
to
shake
with
mirth
when
he
had
finished
he
sent
out
of
the
indians
who
flocked
in
and
about
the
corredor
and
read
the
note
to
his
guests
it
was
from
the
parish
priest
high
up
on
the
mighty
range
that
shut
in
the
river
and
ran
in
part
all
in
a
solemn
almost
sanctimonious
tone
yesterday
dear
compadre
while
on
a
round
of
confession
among
my
scattered
flock
to
whom
god
grant
all
blessings
i
found
in
the
house
of
the
widow
a
poor
little
orphan
newly
born
now
i
beg
of
you
in
the
name
of
charity
and
the
holy
church
to
do
me
the
inestimable
service
of
acting
as
godfather
to
this
unfortunate
little
innocent
that
it
may
not
be
in
danger
of
dying
in
mortal
sin
for
want
of
baptism
we
will
ride
there
on
thursday
now
i
beg
and
pray
you
dear
compadre
to
grant
me
this
favor
and
above
all
to
say
nothing
whatever
of
this
matter
to
anyone
since
it
is
of
no
importance
to
any
but
ourselves
not
even
to
mention
it
to
your
good
and
pious
wife
whom
god
i
began
somewhat
at
a
loss
to
account
for
the
roars
of
laughter
that
increased
with
each
phrase
illustration
a
hint
of
what
the
traveler
on
peruvian
railways
must
put
up
the
clashing
of
colors
and
the
odors
of
and
chicha
illustration
the
wide
main
street
and
a
part
of
the
immense
market
of
huancayo
said
to
be
the
largest
in
peru
the
indians
dressed
in
every
shade
of
vivid
colors
and
carrying
every
species
of
native
product
trot
in
from
a
hundred
miles
around
for
this
sunday
gathering
why
it
see
it
the
padre
knows
the
widow
well
very
well
indeed
explained
my
host
wiping
his
eyes
with
a
corner
of
his
poncho
and
this
is
the
fourth
time
since
i
became
owner
of
casma
that
he
has
asked
me
to
be
godfather
to
some
poor
little
orphan
he
has
found
in
different
parts
of
his
scattered
parish
he
is
a
man
of
force
is
the
padre
but
of
course
he
doesn
t
want
the
good
and
pious
señoras
of
his
flock
to
know
about
his
little
amusements
we
argentinos
who
knows
the
secret
of
keeping
a
secret
from
a
woman
he
concluded
gazing
after
his
wife
as
she
hurried
away
her
shoulders
still
shaking
at
the
ancient
and
graceful
arched
bridge
across
the
mantaro
a
further
down
i
came
to
the
parting
of
the
ways
the
direct
trail
to
ayacucho
continued
along
the
stony
winding
to
tablachaca
but
huancavelica
promised
interest
in
proportion
to
its
isolation
and
i
prevailed
upon
chusquito
to
undertake
the
long
stiff
climb
up
the
face
of
the
range
under
the
vertical
blazing
sunshine
little
patches
inhabited
since
time
immemorial
stood
out
here
and
there
their
green
trees
flowers
and
in
as
sharp
contrast
to
the
grim
mountain
flanks
as
any
oasis
of
the
sahara

above

ancient
town
of
izcochaca

up

hillside

faint
red
or
purple
hue

dug
out
of
the
mountainside
and
tied
in
pairs
on
the
backs
of
donkeys
or
llamas
scores
of
which
we
passed
on
their
way
to
the
great
market
of
huancayo
even
the
inexperienced
andean
traveler
might
easily
have
guessed
what
these
stones
were
from
the
habit
of
the
donkeys
of
licking
the
burdens
of
their
fellows
at
every
halt
salt
is
a
government
monopoly
in
peru
and
truly
peruvian
in
its
condition
in
the
rural
districts
he
who
asks
for
salt
is
handed
a
a
hammer
with
which
to
break
it
or
in
lieu
of
the
latter
he
may
beat
two
slabs
of
this
mountainside
rock
together
and
sprinkle
the
resultant
gravel
on
his
food
it
behooves
the
wise
traveler
to
carry
his
own
of
civilized
salt
for
even
in
the
larger
towns
this
is
often
unattainable
all
the
afternoon
we
undulated
across
a
lofty
with
a
few
human
kennels
of
shepherds
stuck
on
along
the
way
passing
through
one
straw
hamlet
bright
new
in
outward
appearance
since
had
but
recently
passed
in
huando
one
of
those
dismal
rocky
comfortless
cold
indian
towns
that
abound
in
the
sierra
i
made
my
first
acquaintance
with
carrying
staffs
of
office
his
bedraggled
wife
who
was
much
more
at
home
in
quichua
than
in
spanish
sent
a
messenger
to
announce
my
arrival
to
the
gobernador
the
latter
was
a
quaint
little
man
in
wearing
the
only
even
theoretically
white
collar
in
town
and
a
not
too
successful
imitation
of
european
garb
that
did
not
exactly
set
off
to
advantage
his
bashful
rural
dignity
there
ensued
that
long
diplomatic
parley
by
means
of
which
the
traveler
at
length
wins
rural
peru
the
word
must
be
taken
with
a
scanty
meaning
since
it
commonly
consists
of
permission
to
spread
one
s
own
trappings
on
the
earth
floor
of
the
corredor
he
who
would
be
successful
even
in
this
must
never
state
his
wants
abruptly
but
only
gradually
drift
toward
them
without
appearing
to
care
particularly
whether
he
be
granted
the
permission
or
not
ramón
lagos
however
for
all
his
childlike
simplicity
knew
the
duty
of
a
gobernador
toward
a
distinguished
traveler
even
though
he
could
not
fathom
my
reason
for
coming
on
foot
by
the
time
cold
night
was
settling
down
he
had
sent
an
indian
to
pile
my
possessions
in
the
corredor
and
in
due
season
the
most
soapless
of
indian
girls
arrived
with
a
the
of
the
andes
containing
the
wing
and
drumstick
of
a
and
carrying
carefully
on
the
end
of
a
doubt
after
having
stuck
it
there
with
her
unmentionable
fat
leg
of
the
same
squeaky
rodent
then
there
was
ancient
bread
and
weak
tea
and
la
my
hostess
came
to
share
with
me
a
delicacy
she
called
chicharrón
of
pork
meanwhile
i
had
diplomatically
put
the
gobernador
in
possession
of
ten
cents
with
which
to
buy
fodder
for
chusquito
a
messenger
went
forth
and
in
due
time
an
indian
on
the
of
life
appeared
bearing
his
with
all
the
dignity
of
an
english
beadle
behind
him
came
several
youthful
assistants
with
less
pretentious
staffs
of
office
though
they
are
appointed
by
compulsion
these
aids
to
the
ruler
of
an
andean
town
are
proud
in
their
undemonstrative
way
of
being
thus
raised
above
the
common
rabble
none
of
them
would
permit
even
the
wife
of
the
gobernador
to
take
the
black
cane
with
silver
bands
out
of
his
hands
and
i
could
only
admire
them
at
a
distance
not
one
of
the
alguaciles
spoke
a
word
of
spanish
the
gobernador
in
a
napoleonic
voice
gave
the
old
man
an
order
for
two
nickel
s
worth
of
straw
apparently
it
was
not
etiquette
for
the
younger
aids
of
government
to
understand
the
command
direct
from
the
lips
of
the
great
gobernador
himself
the
chief
alcalde
bowed
faintly
and
turned
to
stride
away
with
an
authoritative
if
tread
to
carry
out
the
order
himself
no
indeed
instead
he
passed
it
on
to
one
of
the
youths
whose
badge
of
office
was
a
much
shorter
staff
tied
to
his
wrist
that
it
might
not
interfere
with
the
actual
and
physical
carrying
out
of
the
command
somewhat
later
one
of
these
returned
struggling
under
a
great
bundle
of
straw
the
old
indian
strutting
behind
him
in
all
the
dignity
of
his
high
authority
still
firmly
grasping
his
barajo
after
them
came
a
girl
evidently
the
inferior
of
another
of
the
authoritative
youths
carrying
at
least
a
peck
of
or
barley
i
sat
late
superintending
the
repast
of
my
companion
for
only
the
inexperienced
andean
traveler
will
trust
to
native
supervision
of
his
animal
s
requirements
not
only
do
the
indian
alcaldes
and
alguaciles
hold
office
for
the
mere
honor
of
the
position
but
the
gobernadores
themselves
are
appointed
on
compulsion
and
receive
no
reward
except
from
the
traveler
who
with
great
care
not
to
give
offense
chooses
to
make
up
for
this
governmental
oversight
the
news
of
my
arrival
had
spread
through
the
town
and
in
the
morning
the
alguaciles
had
increased
to
a
who
sat
motionless
about
the
yard
staring
like
ruminating
oxen
and
accepting
with
leisurely
avidity
the
crusts
of
my
desayuno
handed
them
by
the
gobernador
that
official
certain
i
could
not
find
my
way
alone
had
ordered
a
youth
to
accompany
me
but
as
he
was
not
overjoyed
at
the
appointment
it
was
no
hard
matter
to
lose
him
in
the
bleak
and
gloomy
labyrinthian
town
an
tramp
across
an
often
laborious
upland
brilliant
for
all
its
waste
under
the
broad
blue
lift
of
the
sky
raised
a
range
at
the
foot
of
which
lies
huancavelica
the
rolling
uplands
were
alive
now
with
llamas
alpacas
and
sheep
grazing
together
as
one
family
here
was
the
home
of
the
by
the
way
is
the
quichua
term
for
domesticated
only
beast
of
burden
known
to
the
inhabitants
of
peru
before
the
coming
of
the
conquistadores
their
only
domestic
animal
in
fact
except
the
unless
we
count
the
now
exterminated
relics
of
an
ancient
civilization
in
which
they
held
chief
place
the
llama
and
the
indian
of
the
andes
have
much
in
common
they
seem
two
branches
of
the
same
race
who
have
fallen
on
evil
days
together
to
plod
through
modern
life
like
ghosts
of
a
past
both
endure
only
the
high
altitudes
both
are
firmly
wedded
to
their
ancestral
home
both
suffer
uncomplainingly
both
are
temperamentally
incapable
of
haste
the
llama
will
not
travel
alone
but
only
in
company
with
its
fellows
the
indian
is
a
moderately
effective
workman
in
bees
or
bands
but
lacks
the
requisite
to
individual
accomplishment
as
the
indian
squanders
half
his
time
in
fiestas
and
celebrations
and
breaks
his
labors
frequently
for
a
so
the
llama
can
work
but
twelve
or
fifteen
days
a
month
spending
the
rest
in
feeding
the
only
an
indian
can
drive
as
as
the
animals
themselves
never
shouting
or
urging
them
on
with
those
cries
common
to
all
other
arrieros
the
llama
however
is
more
cleanly
in
his
instincts
than
the
indian
does
not
rival
him
as
a
drunkard
and
above
all
retains
a
manly
air
even
under
adversity
in
striking
contrast
to
the
slinking
manner
of
his
human
companion
he
is
the
aristocrat
among
animals
ever
he
has
a
bleat
or
cry
i
have
never
heard
gentle
liquid
eyes
seem
to
look
unseeing
clear
through
one
he
gazes
upon
the
world
about
him
with
an
expression
of
timorous
disdain
and
the
indifference
of
convinced
superiority
his
dignified
attitude
suggests
a
proud
inca
set
to
carrying
or
a
decayed
gentlewoman
refusing
to
be
outwardly
cast
down
by
her
misfortunes
his
air
is
dreamy
as
if
he
were
looking
back
to
the
time
when
he
and
the
incas
reigned
supreme
over
all
the
andean
plateau
like
an
aristocratic
prisoner
on
parole
all
the
security
he
requires
is
a
rope
laid
across
his
neck
or
a
corral
bordered
round
with
stones
a
foot
high
if
the
figure
may
be
carried
still
further
there
is
yet
another
suggestion
of
the
aristocrat
in
the
fact
that
beneath
his
haughty
exterior
he
is
apt
to
be
stupid
assuming
his
impressive
dignity
of
manner
to
cover
this
interior
paucity
of
matter
had
the
llama
been
found
in
north
america
he
would
have
been
exterminated
even
more
completely
than
was
the
indian
he
is
far
too
slow
and
ineffective
a
beast
of
burden
to
endure
long
against
our
national
impatience
he
carries
barely
a
hundred
pounds
and
covers
at
best
ten
miles
a
day
grazing
along
the
way
since
he
can
not
feed
by
night
but
in
the
leisurely
southern
continent
he
still
survives
on
the
high
cold
plateaux
that
are
his
natural
home
as
the
thin
hardy
vegetation
of
páramos
and
punas
is
his
natural
food
and
in
this
day
of
trains
and
automobiles
caravans
of
these
frail
graceful
creatures
their
ears
gaily
decorated
with
bright
ribbons
still
glide
across
the
frigid
heights
as
in
the
centuries
when
they
represented
the
only
freighters
of
an
immense
empire
graceful
when
he
walks
the
llama
runs
with
much
the
same
awkward
gait
as
the
kangaroo
throwing
his
neck
and
looking
at
a
distance
like
an
ostrich
on
four
legs
in
the
region
round
about
us
were
grazing
also
many
called
far
uglier
animal
in
its
thick
wool
of
many
colors
from
black
to
gray
than
the
gracefully
formed
and
generally
white
llama
he
is
suggestive
of
a
shaggy
spring
bear
and
though
he
too
occasionally
serves
as
a
beast
of
burden
his
chief
value
is
in
his
wool
two
other
members
of
the
same
andean
family
the
and
the
found
chiefly
in
the
wilder
regions
further
south
are
never
domesticated
the
latter
graceful
and
delicate
as
a
fawn
produces
the
most
valuable
wool
to
be
found
in
the
western
hemisphere
a
native
horseman
or
more
exactly
muleman
had
fallen
in
with
us
after
striving
for
hours
to
overtake
us
we
rose
and
fell
two
or
three
times
more
over
rocky
ridges
then
came
out
suddenly
on
the
brow
of
a
tremendous
ravine
above
huancavelica
in
a
situation
extraordinary
even
in
comparison
with
the
many
striking
ones
throughout
the
andes
grim
almost
perpendicular
mountains
their
jagged
summits
of
rock
like
decaying
fangs
lay
piled
into
the
sky
on
every
hand
and
completely
boxed
in
a
or
little
flat
plain
in
the
center
of
which
close
at
hand
yet
far
below
us
every
patio
of
the
city
lay
as
plainly
in
sight
as
the
unroofed
houses
of
paris
under
the
gaze
of
diable
the
trail
pitched
so
steeply
downward
that
the
native
was
forced
to
dismount
and
lead
his
mule
you
see
he
boasted
pointing
to
several
iron
crosses
on
almost
inaccessible
crags
high
above
the
city
this
is
a
christian
by
which
he
meant
catholic
the
retort
suggested
itself
that
there
were
other
and
even
less
pleasant
proofs
of
that
fact
but
there
would
have
been
no
gain
in
talking
plainly
to
one
of
his
low
mental
caliber
the
can
always
build
crosses
along
his
roads
even
if
he
can
not
build
the
roads
themselves
our
thighs
ached
from
the
swift
descent
long
before
we
passed
through
the
suburb
of
san
cristobal
separated
from
the
town
proper
by
the
little
mountain
river
ichu
and
we
had
all
but
encircled
the
department
capital
before
an
ancient
bridge
of
a
mixture
of
mud
stones
and
plaster
at
last
gave
us
admittance
rare
is
the
traveler
of
who
passes
through
huancavelica
as
i
climbed
the
slippery
squeaky
streets
toward
the
central
plaza
i
was
quickly
reminded
that
i
was
far
from
the
haunts
of
civilized
man
in
an
isolated
world
where
even
the
sight
of
a
strange
face
is
a
rare
treat
to
say
nothing
of
a
foreigner
in
armed
with
a
revolver
and
a
struggling
to
drag
with
him
a
diminutive
shaggy
mountain
pony
laden
with
miscellaneous
junk
for
chusquito
bewildered
by
the
surroundings
of
an
unknown
city
displayed
an
excitement
and
a
waywardness
of
which
i
had
not
suspected
him
capable
as
i
entered
the
cobbled
and
grassy
plaza
across
which
the
towering
western
was
already
throwing
its
cold
evening
shadow
the
chiefly
indian
soldiers
on
guard
before
the
prefectura
stared
with
bulging
eyes
and
rubbed
their
hands
across
their
brows
as
if
wondering
whether
they
saw
aright
and
whether
they
should
do
anything
about
it
the
adjoining
streets
were
long
lines
of
gaping
faces
each
new
group
falling
suddenly
silent
as
they
caught
sight
of
the
unexpected
apparition
that
had
descended
unheralded
upon
them
and
the
at
best
slight
industry
and
energy
of
huancavelica
came
completely
to
a
standstill
i
was
supplied
with
no
fewer
than
six
letters
of
introduction
the
prefectura
was
officially
closed
which
made
one
useless
i
dragged
chusquito
into
the
patio
of
durán
next
door
and
announced
myself
possessor
of
a
recommendation
to
the
lawyer
from
his
best
friend
in
lima
he
acted
like
a
peruvian
not
merely
did
he
decline
to
step
out
of
his
office
but
sent
an
indian
boy
to
demand
the
letter
when
i
presented
myself
in
the
doorway
instead
he
read
it
with
fear
plainly
depicted
on
his
features
that
he
might
be
obliged
to
offer
hospitality
to
a
man
who
could
not
be
a
caballero
since
he
came
on
foot
and
as
plainly
sought
some
loophole
to
avoid
that
necessity
he
found
one
too
when
he
turned
again
to
the
envelope
the
writer
had
carelessly
written
the
first
name
and
though
he
had
explained
the
error
had
not
taken
the
trouble
to
change
it
ah
but
this
letter
is
not
for
me
cried
the
lawyer
triumphantly
it
is
addressed
to
felipe
and
i
am
enrique
he
knew
as
well
as
i
that
there
was
not
another
durán
in
all
huancavelica
the
throng
that
had
massed
about
the
zaguán
led
me
en
masse
to
a
building
that
had
once
been
a
hotel
on
the
further
corner
of
the
plaza
it
was
too
much
to
expect
the
inhabitants
to
know
already
that
it
had
ceased
its
ministrations
to
proprietor
had
been
barely
four
years
dead
the
whispering
chorus
about
me
swelled
gradually
to
the
audible
assertion
that
there
was
another
establishment
a
few
squares
away
which
sometimes
had
given
accommodations
to
at
that
moment
a
soldier
bearing
a
naked
sword
in
one
hand
and
a
musket
in
the
other
came
running
to
say
that
the
ayudante
wished
to
know
who
i
was
why
where
whence
and
all
the
rest
of
it
that
i
was
to
report
to
him
at
once
i
commandeered
the
messenger
to
lead
me
to
the
rumored
hostelry
before
we
reached
it
however
a
boy
shouted
to
a
shopkeeper
leaning
out
over
his
to
watch
the
unwonted
excitement
fact
i
had
chanced
to
mention
to
some
one
whereupon
it
instantly
became
general
had
a
letter
for
solomón
atala
the
turk
for
such
he
was
dashed
into
the
crowd
and
announced
himself
the
addressee
very
well
you
will
come
and
live
at
my
house
he
cried
when
he
had
perused
the
note
i
protested
that
a
public
hostelry
in
the
andes
was
too
rare
a
luxury
to
be
lightly
given
up
and
that
it
was
bad
enough
to
intrude
upon
private
families
when
there
was
no
other
alternative
the
turk
would
not
hear
any
such
argument
i
had
been
recommended
by
his
good
friend
and
i
belonged
to
him
as
long
as
i
chose
to
remain
in
huancavelica
memories
of
palestine
reminded
me
that
to
men
of
his
race
hospitality
has
none
of
the
hollow
nothingness
common
to
peru
while
we
stood
talking
a
boy
surreptitiously
led
chusquito
off
down
a
gaping
to
the
turk
s
home
and
i
had
perforce
to
follow
my
possessions
disappeared
through
a
narrow
door
within
a
door
once
through
which
i
found
myself
in
the
littered
patio
of
an
ancient
house
of
ample
rambling
proportions
a
female
voice
bade
me
mount
a
stairway
to
a
sagging
balcony
completely
surrounding
the
yard
barely
had
i
dubiously
set
foot
upon
it
than
there
popped
out
several
slatternly
women
and
the
mightiest
swarm
of
unassorted
children
i
had
ever
yet
seen
in
captivity
my
imagination
began
to
picture
what
sleeping
and
writing
notes
and
getting
the
few
days
rest
to
which
i
was
entitled
would
be
in
that
swarming
household
and
unable
to
think
of
any
ceremonial
excuse
i
slipped
down
the
aged
stairs
untied
chusquito
and
dragged
him
away
up
the
slippery
cobbled
street
the
worst
of
it
was
that
i
had
to
pass
the
turk
s
shop
again
to
reach
the
hotel
the
good
fellow
was
just
locking
up
to
come
home
and
entertain
me
and
he
pounced
upon
me
at
once
quite
literally
throwing
his
arms
about
me
and
attempting
to
drag
me
off
bodily
while
huancavelica
stared
upon
us
from
every
doorway
but
i
had
set
my
heart
on
the
repose
of
a
room
of
my
own
beating
off
the
affectionate
turk
with
one
hand
and
struggling
in
vain
to
keep
chusquito
off
the
sidewalk
and
out
of
each
succeeding
shop
with
the
other
i
gradually
worked
my
way
forward
leaving
my
host
on
the
verge
of
tears
and
gained
at
last
the
it
was
a
dislocated
little
building
of
long
long
ago
wrapped
like
a
carelessly
flung
garment
around
a
tiny
patio
its
most
conspicuous
feature
the
city
in
which
a
youths
of
sporting
proclivities
were
least
until
they
caught
sight
of
us
summoned
from
the
mysterious
interior
the
respectful
and
astonished
proprietor
went
in
quest
of
a
key
and
unlocked
the
padlock
of
one
of
three
small
doors
tucked
away
in
as
many
corners
of
the
made
of
battered
drygoods
boxes
with
the
lettering
still
upon
them
so
precious
is
lumber
in
these
treeless
that
the
other
two
rooms
were
ocupados
with
empty
bottles
or
certainly
not
with
guests
the
chamber
assigned
me
awoke
my
gratitude
it
was
to
be
sure
so
small
that
i
could
touch
both
walls
at
once
windowless
and
doorless
except
for
the
narrow
opening
by
which
i
squeezed
in
gloomy
and
chill
after
the
fashion
of
adobe
mountain
rooms
long
closed
but
it
was
furnished
even
to
a
bed
with
real
springs
barely
had
i
carried
my
traps
inside
when
there
burst
into
the
patio
another
turk
who
asserted
in
gestureful
spanish
that
was
the
real
solomón
atala
to
whom
i
belonged
during
my
stay
in
huancavelica
the
other
being
merely
his
brother
who
had
opened
the
letter
in
the
brotherly
way
of
palestinians
he
too
was
a
believer
in
forcible
hospitality
and
the
hotel
proprietor
looked
on
in
helpless
dismay
at
what
promised
to
be
a
successful
attempt
to
carry
off
his
only
guest
patron
saint
of
hoteleros
knows
how
long
a
bed
with
springs
in
a
room
by
myself
however
was
not
a
luxury
to
be
given
up
for
the
mere
danger
of
making
a
few
turkish
enemies
and
in
the
end
the
engaging
syrian
seeing
no
way
out
of
it
admitted
with
bad
grace
that
as
i
already
had
my
possessions
scattered
about
the
hotel
room
it
would
be
unfair
to
the
proprietor
not
to
retain
it
i
should
remain
where
i
was
until
morning
when
we
would
talk
the
matter
over
he
agreed
under
protest
and
at
length
gloomily
took
his
departure
this
friend
in
town
is
the
bugbear
of
or
keepers
in
the
andes
the
arabian
notion
of
hospitality
inherited
from
the
moors
and
mixed
perhaps
with
the
traditions
of
inca
days
with
their
free
and
public
tambos
along
all
the
highways
of
the
empire
still
holds
sway
at
least
superficially
the
peruvian
will
all
his
life
put
up
with
begging
lodging
food
and
fodder
on
his
travels
often
going
without
them
entirely
rather
than
help
support
a
hotel
considering
it
a
sign
of
high
rank
to
be
housed
by
an
outwardly
delighted
acquaintance
and
thus
cheat
the
struggling
hotelero
out
of
a
livelihood

of
the

with

stalked
in

down
at

end
of
a
long
table
near
a
small
opening

the
wall

looked

proprietor
proceeded
with
fitting
gravity
to
serve
me
a
thoroughly
peruvian
meal
of
which
the
chief
ingredient
was
a

steak
not

beef

i
at
first
fancied

to

a
corner
of
the
barnyard
to
poke
the
various
dishes
through
the
hole
in
the
wall
and
then
reappeared
within
to
serve
them
it
may
have
been
a
long
time
since
he
had
been
honored
with
a
guest
but
he
had
not
forgotten
the
proper
form
of
service
after
each
trip
he
balanced
on
alternate
legs
staring
at
me
silently
until
at
last
his
tongue
refused
longer
to
obey
his
will
when
he
burst
out
tremulously
usté
es
andarín
no
not
at
all
i
replied
to
his
patent
disappointment
you
see
i
haven
t
a
single
medal
on
my
ah
then
you
travel
to
sell
something
jewelry
perhaps
like
all
franceses
squier
traveling
through
the
andes
a
ago
found
that
in
the
sierra
all
foreigners
are
supposed
to
be
french
in
nationality
and
peddlers
of
jewelry
by
profession
and
conditions
have
changed
little
to
this
day
the
was
openly
incredulous
of
my
second
denial
but
once
the
of
his
curiosity
had
been
opened
the
flow
of
words
swamped
even
the
service
and
the
soup
had
long
since
become
a
memory
of
the
dim
past
before
he
poked
the
of
melted
panela
through
to
himself
i
made
my
escape
at
last
and
went
to
sit
on
the
wooden
sofa
in
the
as
the
only
place
in
town
with
light
enough
to
see
oneself
by
but
my
distinguished
presence
was
so
evidently
the
cause
of
bad
shots
that
gradually
turned
the
players
bitterly
resentful
and
the
atmosphere
was
so
decidedly
wintry
that
i
soon
hit
the
hay
literally
for
such
proved
to
be
the
filling
of
the
outwardly
mattress
i
had
barely
ventured
into
the
street
next
morning
when
i
was
dragged
into
the
shop
of
the
two
palestinians
after
a
bitter
and
noisy
struggle
we
patched
up
a
truce
as
follows
since
i
was
already
enstalled
there
i
was
to
keep
my
room
at
the
hotel
but
it
was
at
their
house
that
i
must
take
breakfast
and
dinner
and
desayuno
cried
the
turks
as
one
man
you
must
also
come
and
take
breakfast
with
us
if
you
like
eggs
or
steak
or
pickled
pigs
feet
or
very
well
even
if
you
take
only
coffee
and
bread
like
a
peruvian
though
it
was
barely
ten
of
a
brilliant
sunday
morning
the
andean
merchant
s
richest
hour
they
shut
up
shop
in
spite
of
the
mild
protests
of
a
dozen
ponchoed
shoppers
and
led
the
way
to
their
rambling
residence
a
meal
heavy
with
meat
was
enlivened
with
an
excellent
wine
that
could
have
cost
little
less
than
a
small
fortune
at
this
altitude
the
manners
of
the
household
recalled
palestine
we
three
men
sat
at
table
with
our
hats
on
in
arabic
as
well
as
andean
fashion
while
the
women
hovered
more
or
less
inconspicuously
in
the
background
a
dozen
small
children
of
both
sexes
crawled
and
climbed
and
sprawled
and
displayed
their
plump
unwashed
nakedness
on
around
and
under
the
table
drinking
wine
and
swearing
like
arrieros
in
both
spanish
and
quichua
they
were
being
brought
up
in
the
palestinian
which
is
to
some
extent
the
fashion
that
forbade
coercion
and
were
heartily
laughed
at
and
dubbed
cute
whenever
they
did
anything
particularly
naughty
or
disobedient
the
two
syrians
as
we
would
call
them
or
turks
as
their
are
known
through
all
south
america
had
left
bethlehem
some
eight
years
before
they
announced
themselves
christians
which
meant
merely
that
they
were
not
mohammedans
though
as
behooves
ambitious
merchants
they
diplomatically
avoided
any
religious
controversy
with
their
clients
for
several
years
they
had
peddled
on
foot
over
all
the
accessible
portion
of
central
peru
descending
even
into
the
montaña
or
great
hot
lands
to
the
east
the
abode
of
rubber
fever
and
wild
indians
bit
by
bit
they
had
established
shops
in
various
towns
until
they
had
come
to
be
among
the
most
important
merchants
of
the
region
with
headquarters
in
huancavelica
and
branches
in
charge
of
more
youthful
in
the
chief
centers
of
population
of
the
department
their
success
was
typical
of
thousands
of
men
of
their
race
throughout
the
southern
continent
for
the
native
equally
scanty
of
initiative
industry
and
the
inclination
to
risk
his
capital
is
at
best
an
ineffective
competitor
of
this
tireless
race
of
born
shopkeepers
of
productive
labor
great
as
is
the
call
for
it
in
this
backward
andean
land
the
turk
brings
nothing
nor
is
his
example
likely
to
better
the
personal
habits
of
the
native
population
though
it
may
breed
more
effective
business
methods
and
even
a
higher
grade
of
commercial
say
nothing
of
hospitality
it
is
not
by
such
immigration
however
that
the
dormant
continent
will
be
rejuvenated
my
irrepressible
hosts
cherished
a
hazy
dream
of
some
day
returning
to
palestine
with
their
fortune
yet
their
children
spoke
not
a
word
of
the
arabic
that
still
served
for
most
of
the
intercourse
between
the
men
and
their
slatternly
wives
the
brothers
themselves
were
fluent
not
only
in
spanish
but
in
quichua
the
throaty
dialect
of
the
aboriginals
has
much
in
common
with
the
no
less
guttural
arabic
as
the
similarity
of
customs
and
point
of
view
makes
the
race
particularly
adaptable
to
peruvian
surroundings
no
other
foreigner
fits
better
into
the
life
of
the
andes
and
it
is
not
strange
that
the
syrian
has
most
effectively
invaded
andean
commerce
even
the
chinaman
who
quickly
disappears
as
the
traveler
turns
his
back
on
lima
has
found
it
impossible
to
compete
with
these
more
western
orientals
it
is
unfortunate
that
the
traveler
given
to
reporting
his
wanderings
can
not
have
his
mind
erased
every
little
while
like
a
slate
for
so
quickly
do
the
sights
and
sounds
of
a
strange
country
sink
to
the
commonplace
that
many
things
that
might
delight
the
pass
unnoticed
thus
an
american
untouched
with
the
contempt
of
familiarity
suddenly
set
down
in
huancavelica
would
no
doubt
find
it
abounding
with
local
hays
who
journeyed
overland
to
cuzco
some
months
before
me
enthusiastically
proclaimed
it
the
most
picturesque
town
in
south
but
to
one
who
had
followed
the
andes
step
by
step
it
was
rather
monotonously
like
any
other
town
of
the
sierra
its
customs
varying
only
in
a
few
minor
details
from
those
that
had
long
since
grown
familiar
by
night
it
lies
silent
and
dead
under
its
cold
stars
dawn
finds
the
fountain
in
its
central
plaza
de
la
independencia
bearded
with
icicles
and
no
clock
or
could
give
the
hour
more
exactly
than
the
regularity
with
which
these
drip
away
to
nothing
in
the
late
morning
for
the
sun
falls
tardily
on
huancavelica
having
first
to
climb
the
mountain
rampart
that
shuts
it
in
on
the
east
the
town
wisely
remains
in
bed
until
the
god
of
the
incas
has
asserted
his
brilliant
undisputed
sway
and
my
of
rising
at
daybreak
gave
me
the
sensation
of
strolling
through
a
city
from
which
the
entire
populace
had
fled
indeed
the
only
really
comfortable
place
in
town
was
in
bed
all
day
long
one
shivered
in
the
shade
or
burned
in
the
sun
in
my
dank
dungeon
cell
it
was
distinctly
too
dark
cold
and
gloomy
to
read
or
write
on
the
red
benches
of
the
plaza
the
glare
of
the
molten
disk
above
was
too
brilliant
to
endure
even
when
some
unsophisticated
old
native
did
not
join
me
and
remain
deaf
to
all
hints
that
even
a
traveler
has
his
work
to
do
i
soon
formed
the
habit
of
taking
daily
possession
of
the
ancient
facing
the
white
here
was
a
bench
on
which
i
could
by
constant
manipulation
keep
myself
in
the
sun
and
my
in
the
shade
and
as
it
was
apparently
against
the
rules
or
contrary
to
for
a
native
to
occupy
the
structure
i
sat
here
hour
after
hour
in
solitary
glory
flanked
by
the
four
staring
sides
of
the
plaza
the
activity
of
an
andean
town
can
generally
be
gaged
by
its
plaza
and
by
that
token
huancavelica
was
inactive
indeed
evidently
no
industry
more
important
than
a
could
be
run
by
natives
and
foreigners
were
rare
charcoal
braziers
or
the
at
the
backs
of
huts
where
crouched
old
women
almost
too
feeble
to
drive
off
the
curs
that
swarmed
around
the
steaming
earthen
calabashes
represented
the
ordinary
cooking
processes
the
fires
being
now
and
then
given
new
life
with
a
bamboo
or
fan
so
bucolic
was
the
populace
that
every
stroll
through
the
streets
brought
a
score
of
inquiries
as
to
what
i
was
selling
many
regarding
even
my
kodak
as
a
and
inviting
me
to
enter
while
children
and
alike
hastened
to
summon
the
rest
of
the
family
as
often
as
i
hove
in
sight
in
common
with
all
latins
the
people
are
lovers
of
perpetual
noise
and
have
no
conception
of
our
desire
to
be
occasionally
let
alone
though
the
annoyances
were
always
innocent
rather
than
intentional
i
could
not
pause
for
a
moment
that
i
did
not
have
a
surrounding
mob
and
there
was
almost
constantly
a
procession
of
boys
and
even
those
old
enough
to
know
better
at
my
heels
if
i
paused
to
look
at
an
old
carved
or
an
ancient
balcony
necks
were
craned
in
wonder
as
to
what
on
earth
an
from
the
great
outside
world
could
find
of
interest
in
the
lifelong
sights
of
their
drowsy
capital
yet
there
was
a
peculiar
repose
and
quiet
about
the
place
as
if
it
were
literally
shut
off
by
its
grim
from
all
the
troubles
of
the
great
world
shopkeepers
locked
up
and
went
home
to
play
or
sleep
whenever
the
whim
struck
them
though
a
department
capital
there
was
not
a
physician
in
town
nor
any
open
evidence
of
a
and
while
there
was
no
doubt
some
advantage
in
this
state
of
affairs
the
from
dysentery
and
pneumonia
was
high
an
awkward
mountain
people
they
had
not
even
the
usual
mountaineer
virtue
of
shyness
being
as
forward
in
their
manner
as
hebrews
i
was
never
out
of
sight
of
at
least
one
authority
a
ragged
indian
from
some
neighboring
hamlet
up
among
the
higher
ranges
clinging
jealously
to
his
black
cane
of
office
pacos
and
llamas
could
be
made
out
tiny
as
mice
feeding
on
the
perpendicular
crags
sheer
above
the
town
among
the
abrupt
splintered
masses
of
rock
that
cut
all
the
surrounding
sharply
with
their
jagged
crests
as
i
was
strolling
about
town
the
day
after
my
arrival
a
soldier
again
came
running
after
me
to
say
that
the
prefect
himself
desired
me
to
report
and
explain
myself
i
handed
the
menial
my
card
and
heard
no
more
of
the
matter
the
printed
name
on
a
bit
of
cardboard
is
proof
sufficient
of
aristocracy
in
most
of
south
america
burglars
and
highwaymen
contemplating
entrance
into
that
field
of
activities
would
do
well
to
provide
themselves
with
a
plentiful
supply
of
visiting
cards
the
larger
and
more
imposing
the
better
later
on
when
i
called
on
the
department
ruler
at
my
own
volition
and
with
the
dignity
befitting
an
envoy
from
the
outside
world
a
man
was
assigned
to
attend
me
on
any
excursions
i
chose
to
make
in
or
about
the
town
the
origin
of
the
name
of
huancavelica
is
curious
there
was
it
seems
no
town
here
at
the
time
of
the
conquest
to
the
incas
this
flat
enclosed
plain
with
its
clear
little
river
offered
too
fine
an
opportunity
for
their
enemies
to
roll
rocks
down
upon
them
from
the
towering
heights
above
centuries
ago
there
settled
on
the
spot
an
indian
of
the
huanca
tribe
inhabiting
the
great
valley
between
jauja
and
huancayo
he
died
young
and
for
long
years
his
wife
dwelt
alone
in
the
only
hut
in
this
capacious
her
name
was
isabel
which
in
south
america
becomes
familiarly
or
affectionately
her
hut
was
a
sort
of
tambo
where
a
bit
of
corn
or
eggs
might
occasionally
be
had
or
at
least
pasture
for
and
shelter
from
the
páramo
winds
hence
travelers
through
the
region
asked
where
they
would
spend
the
night
announced
voy
llegar
donde
la
huanca
then
it
was
discovered
that
the
grim
treeless
mountains
piled
into
the
sky
about
the
little
valley
were
rich
in
quicksilver
and
a
mining
town
built
itself
up
about
the
hut
of
isabel
the
huanca
for
centuries
the
great
santa
barbara
mine
high
above
the
town
and
several
smaller
workings
in
the
vicinity
yielded
the
mercury
used
in
potosi
and
in
all
the
mines
of
peru
high
or
low
which
was
brought
from
huancavelica
on
the
backs
of
llamas
then
as
more
scientific
methods
came
into
vogue
the
miners
turned
to
california
for
their
supply
until
the
mercury
queen
is
but
an
echo
of
her
former
greatness
and
the
open
shafts
of
her
cinnabar
mines
which
rumor
has
it
left
several
of
the
surrounding
ranges
great
hollow
caverns
stand
silent
and
deserted
it
is
this
failure
to
keep
up
with
modern
times
that
has
left
huancavelica
one
of
the
most
picturesque
department
capitals
with
poverty
her
chief
handmaid
lack
of
transportation
is
her
principal
drawback
the
very
town
itself
is
said
to
sit
on
top
of
great
deposits
of
quicksilver
workmen
digging
for
the
foundation
of
a
new
building
on
a
corner
of
the
plaza
during
my
sojourn
found
mercury
bubbling
up
out
of
the
ground
modern
miners
however
refuse
to
operate
where
only
the
slow
and
unreliable
llama
must
be
depended
on
for
transportation
and
only
when
the
railroad
arrives
will
huancavelica
come
into
her
own
again
the
chief
point
of
interest
was
the
famous
old
mercury
mine
of
santa
barbara
strangely
enough
the
cicerone
appeared
within
an
hour
of
the
daylight
time
set
though
without
breakfast
and
shared
with
me
the
results
of
my
own
handicraft
a
roundabout
but
exceedingly
steep
road
on
which
we
panted
audibly
in
spite
of
frequent
halts
for
breath
brought
us
to
our
goal
far
above
the
town
near
a
silent
cold
indian
hamlet
with
an
aged
spanish
church
facing
its
dreary
plaza
was
the
ruin
of
a
of
colonial
days
and
behind
it
the
imposing
arched
entrance
to
the
enormous
caverns
said
to
undermine
all
the
neighboring
range
above
this
was
a
large
spanish
cut
in
stone
with
the
information
that
the
arch
had
been
constructed
by
general
fulano
in
and
the
relief
of
a
saint
holding
a
child
the
silence
of
long
abandonment
brooded
over
all
the
scene
we
lighted
the
medieval
borrowed
from
the
hotel
and
disappeared
within
the
tunnel
that
led
straight
into
the
mountainside
was
large
enough
if
not
for
a
railway
train
at
least
for
a
horseman
to
have
ridden
in
comfortably
its
floor
easily
as
good
a
road
as
the
average
peruvian
one
outside
here
and
there
we
crawled
over
a
heap
of
stones
and
earth
where
a
part
of
the
wall
had
fallen
and
at
paces
from
the
mouth
were
halted
by
a
that
had
choked
up
the
entire
tunnel
my
companion
had
assured
me
that
the
spirits
of
ancient
spaniards
and
their
indian
victims
lying
in
wait
for
unwary
moderns
made
our
entrance
perilous
in
the
extreme
and
once
permission
was
given
lost
no
time
in
retreating
from
the
exit
we
went
skirting
the
mountain
to
the
ancient
mining
village
of
chaclatacana
about
which
and
scattered
over
all
the
vicinity
were
the
evidences
of
little
mines
the
indians
had
dug
on
their
own
account
the
cinebrio
deposits
of
the
region
were
first
disclosed
to
the
spaniards
in
by
the
custom
of
the
aboriginals
of
painting
their
faces
with
it
my
guide
asserted
that
condors
were
numerous
and
often
dangerous
to
the
eyes
of
men
wandering
over
these
lofty
heights
but
it
was
my
luck
not
to
catch
sight
of
one
of
those
giant
birds
of
the
andes
i
was
rewarded
however
for
taking
the
that
proved
longer
and
more
laborious
than
the
road
by
a
bird
s
eye
view
of
huancavelica
so
directly
below
us
that
we
could
have
tossed
our
hats
into
the
central
plaza
here
too
among
the
split
and
jagged
we
stumbled
upon
a
colony
of
biscachos
my
companion
called
the
only
quadruped
besides
the
and
the
llama
family
indigenous
to
the
peruvian
highlands
the
creature
is
sometimes
dubbed
the
squirrel
of
the
andes
but
its
size
was
more
nearly
that
of
the
rabbit
its
prominent
tail
and
means
of
locomotion
suggestive
of
some
diminutive
species
of
the
kangaroo
its
color
not
unlike
that
of
our
prairie
dog
which
it
resembled
somewhat
also
in
its
manner
of
dodging
in
and
out
among
the
rocks
and
crags
as
if
inviting
us
to
a
game
of
hide
and
according
to
my
attendant
the
meat
of
the
animal
is
even
more
succulent
than
providing
the
tail
is
cut
off
at
the
moment
of
killing
but
for
the
unkindness
of
fate
there
would
have
been
a
gala
in
huancavelica
on
the
sunday
of
my
stay
the
one
negro
i
had
seen
shivering
about
town
turned
out
to
be
a
torero
at
his
own
lima
for
the
occasion
the
corral
behind
the
rambling
dwelling
of
my
hosts
had
been
turned
into
a
ring
a
square
one
to
be
sure
laboriously
fenced
with
poles
tied
with
bark
and
cords
to
upright
stakes
but
on
saturday
afternoon
just
as
the
town
was
rubbing
its
hands
together
at
the
prospect
of
a
entertainment
the
one
bull
that
was
to
have
furnished
it
sprang
through
the
barrier
and
over
the
low
wall
to
the
sunken
street
below
fifteen
feet
if
it
was
an
inch
and
instead
of
dying
on
the
spot
was
last
seen
making
record
time
for
his
mountain
pasture
the
irrepressible
turks
were
wellnigh
obnoxious
in
their
hospitality
the
most
of
travelers
acquires
gradually
and
unconsciously
a
new
point
of
view
with
respect
to
his
pack
when
he
is
no
longer
forced
to
burden
his
own
shoulders
with
it
and
articles
that
have
hitherto
seemed
only
useless
weight
take
on
the
aspect
of
necessities
but
after
they
had
sold
me
an
enamel
cup
and
a
roll
of
for
fusslappen
the
syrians
refused
vociferously
to
accept
payment
when
i
caught
sight
of
a
that
might
have
served
to
while
away
the
tramp
across
the
lonely
uninhabited
world
ahead
my
mere
glance
at
it
caused
josé
to
drop
it
into
my
pocket
when
i
was
off
my
guard
a
wordy
battle
ended
with
his
acceptance
of
a
which
he
swore
was
the
wholesale
price
of
an
instrument
marked
to
retail
for
five
times
that
amount
but
it
cost
me
eternal
vigilance
to
keep
now
one
now
the
other
brother
from
surreptitiously
returning
the
coin
there
was
nothing
left
but
to
curtail
my
purchases
to
choose
from
their
stock
was
to
have
charity
thrust
upon
me
to
buy
off
their
rivals
would
have
been
the
height
of
insults
and
would
quickly
have
published
to
all
the
town
their
lack
of
hospitality
or
my
ingratitude
my
last
day
with
them
the
firm
of
atala
hermanos
spent
in
writing
me
letters
of
introduction
to
all
their
countrymen
from
huancavelica
to
cape
horn
and
when
i
sneaked
into
their
patio
at
dawn
next
morning
bent
on
abducting
chusquito
unseen
the
entire
household
was
already
waiting
to
drag
me
in
to
an
extraordinary
breakfast
not
satisfied
with
that
they
forced
upon
me
a
boiled
and
several
other
delicacies
among
them
a
dozen
raw
eggs
which
tied
in
a
handkerchief
on
chusquito
s
back
broke
one
by
one
with
his
jolting
gait
and
ran
in
yellow
streams
down
the
rubber
poncho
that
covered
the
pack
all
huancavelica
united
in
attempting
to
force
a
guide
upon
me
asserting
that
even
hijos
del
lugar
frequently
lost
themselves
on
the
trackless
puna
beyond
i
smiled
indulgently
at
what
had
long
since
become
a
threadbare
prophesy
but
had
occasion
to
recall
it
before
the
day
was
done
the
way
mounted
steadily
all
the
morning
uncovering
a
vast
world
that
stretched
forever
before
me
in
the
early
hours
it
was
scantily
inhabited
by
wild
shepherds
watching
over
flocks
of
llamas
pacos
or
sheep
and
leisurely
busy
turning
wool
into
yarn
on
their
crude
spindles
an
occupation
that
gave
the
men
a
curiously
effeminate
air
out
of
all
keeping
with
their
rough
exterior
these
chary
fellows
took
good
care
that
we
should
not
come
within
shouting
distance
of
them
and
even
the
rare
travelers
and
llama
drivers
made
wide
circuits
to
avoid
us
as
if
fearful
of
their
defenselessness
on
this
bleak
shelterless
top
of
the
world
if
taken
unaware
in
some
fold
of
the
earth
they
muttered
some
stupidity
in
the
quichua
slang
dialect
of
the
region
and
sped
away
like
startled
hares
unable
to
make
inquiries
i
could
only
trust
to
chance
compass
and
the
instinct
that
develops
with
long
andean
travel
for
on
these
broad
the
traveler
is
by
no
means
master
of
the
situation
and
to
guess
wrong
between
several
at
best
faintly
marked
paths
may
be
to
go
hopelessly
astray
and
come
out
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
andes
from
that
toward
which
one
is
headed
for
long
stretches
the
dreary
páramo
showed
no
sign
whatever
of
travel
though
here
and
there
the
droppings
of
llamas
gave
the
route
a
more
or
less
fixed
direction
a
jolly
old
indian
whom
i
came
upon
in
the
afternoon
plodding
patiently
behind
his
haughty
train
had
seen
enough
of
the
world
to
have
lost
some
of
his
fear
of
white
men
and
assured
me
i
was
still
on
the
right
road
but
he
must
have
been
mistaken
or
else
i
guessed
wrong
at
the
next
opportunity
for
the
bit
of
trail
that
had
grown
up
under
my
feet
split
irreconcilably
and
left
at
the
hour
when
i
should
have
come
upon
an
hacienda
reputed
hospitable
to
travelers
only
the
rolling
trackless
yellow
puna
stretching
away
on
every
hand
illustration
huancavelica
one
of
the
most
picturesque
and
provincial
capitals
of
peru
is
completely
boxed
in
by
grim
rocky
mountain
walls
noted
for
their
deposits
of
mercury
the
city
itself
is
more
than
two
miles
above
a
raging
of
rain
and
hail
under
which
the
vast
land
and
skyscape
turned
dark
as
night
soon
broke
upon
us
i
had
struggled
a
long
distance
through
the
storm
when
i
faintly
made
out
a
little
cluster
of
huts
some
distance
to
the
right
in
a
wrinkle
of
the
pampa
after
i
had
overcome
my
own
disinclination
to
go
out
of
my
way
to
seek
lodging
there
was
needed
a
laborious
argument
to
bring
my
companion
to
my
way
of
thinking
for
chusquito
would
have
none
of
your
side
trips
the
truth
is
i
had
been
somewhat
deceived
and
disappointed
in
the
disposition
of
my
chosen
as
long
as
the
road
lay
straight
and
undoubtedly
before
us
he
was
an
ideal
companion
never
breaking
the
thread
of
my
reflections
by
calling
attention
to
the
scenery
nor
otherwise
making
himself
humanly
obnoxious
but
in
temperament
he
might
best
be
likened
to
a
cat
accepting
all
favors
and
friendly
overtures
with
a
complacent
aloofness
and
manner
that
resembled
ingratitude
refusing
to
be
won
over
even
by
caresses
to
the
faintest
expression
of
a
reciprocal
affection
moreover
he
had
a
will
not
to
say
a
wilfulness
of
his
own
that
is
inimical
to
all
genuine
companionship
on
the
road
and
a
respect
for
that
betrayed
his
training
i
felt
no
compunction
in
having
recourse
to
brute
force
in
a
dispute
under
such
circumstances
as
then
faced
us
however
and
we
soon
gained
the
only
visible
shelter
on
a
cold
cheerless
spot
almost
devoid
of
even
the
vegetation
of
high
pampas
i
found
five
miserable
human
kennels
of
loosely
laid
stones
and
ichu
grass
in
charge
of
several
gaunt
savage
yet
cowardly
curs
and
an
indian
boy
speaking
only
monosyllabic
quichua
all
the
huts
except
a
structure
that
served
as
kitchen
had
huge
native
padlocks
on
the
doors
choked
with
thirst
in
tantalizing
contrast
to
my
dripping
garments
and
the
raging
storm
i
called
for
water
manam
cancha
murmured
the
boy
dully
using
the
quichua
version
of
that
stereotyped
andean
falsehood
there
is
yacu
i
shouted
jokingly
laying
a
hand
on
my
revolver
he
slunk
away
and
picked
up
a
battered
cup
behind
one
of
the
huts
wiping
this
on
his
lifelong
sleeve
he
scraped
the
bottom
of
a
huge
earthen
jar
that
leaned
awry
in
what
would
have
needed
only
a
fence
to
be
a
barnyard
at
an
angle
that
enabled
the
dogs
to
help
themselves
at
the
same
source
and
presented
the
vessel
to
me
there
was
no
second
choice
in
the
matter
for
this
region
untold
miles
above
had
no
other
supply
of
water
than
the
rain
that
chanced
to
drop
into
the
leaning
cántaros
fortunately
the
taste
bore
little
evidence
of
what
the
appearance
suggested
i
made
a
round
of
the
huts
resolved
to
spend
the
night
there
even
if
i
had
to
break
into
one
of
the
buildings
i
cried
patching
my
quichua
together
after
my
own
fashion
and
pointing
to
one
of
the
padlocks
manam
cancha
repeated
the
in
the
same
dull
monotone
i
held
out
what
would
have
seemed
a
fortune
of
small
coins
to
a
country
boy
of
other
lands
but
he
shook
his
head
doggedly
without
a
gleam
of
interest
casting
a
glance
at
my
weapon
an
older
youth
who
had
appeared
noiselessly
from
somewhere
treated
the
offer
of
money
with
the
same
indifference
and
settled
down
to
a
silent
attempt
to
drive
me
off
in
spite
of
the
storm
and
the
night
that
was
closing
in
it
was
then
that
i
thought
of
the
sack
i
had
filled
in
the
market
of
huancayo
at
the
magic
word
coca
the
pair
awoke
to
a
new
interest
in
life
each
snatched
off
his
hat
to
receive
a
handful
of
leaves
mumbling
a
gracias
and
the
older
youth
ordered
the
other
to
clear
away
a
miscellaneous
assortment
of
junk
bundles
of
old
sheepskins
and
a
heap
of
gathered
for
fuel
from
one
end
of
the
hut
porch
under
the
edge
of
which
i
was
seated
as
he
worked
there
fell
from
somewhere
under
the
projecting
eaves
the
corpse
of
a
tiny
black
pig
that
had
quite
evidently
died
a
natural
death
but
which
the
family
just
as
evidently
proposed
to
eat
for
the
boy
carried
it
off
to
a
safer
spot
plainly
doubting
my
honesty
in
a
corner
lay
two
bundles
of
ichu
grass
i
tossed
one
to
chusquito
standing
dejected
and
disgusted
beside
me
and
spread
out
the
other
as
a
mattress
the
youth
made
no
protest
but
shook
his
head
at
the
i
offered
in
payment
a
howling
wind
that
even
the
stone
hut
failed
to
break
made
it
useless
to
attempt
to
set
up
my
cooking
outfit
as
i
drew
cold
food
from
my
pack
the
indians
sat
motionless
as
stone
statues
but
watched
with
keen
eyes
my
every
move
i
shared
the
lunch
with
them
though
i
should
much
have
preferred
paying
them
in
money
for
their
dubious
hospitality
it
is
one
of
the
drawbacks
of
andean
journeying
that
the
traveler
is
expected
to
share
his
scanty
supplies
not
merely
with
his
human
companions
of
the
moment
but
is
invariably
surrounded
under
such
circumstances
by
a
ravenous
swarm
of
begging
and
thieving
dogs
pigs
and
fowls
except
for
a
score
of
llamas
lying
in
patrician
aloofness
beyond
the
huts
every
living
creature
crowded
round
to
appeal
to
my
generosity
or
to
catch
me
off
my
guard
the
indians
accepted
each
morsel
with
a
murmured
gracias
that
plainly
proceeded
from
custom
rather
than
from
any
real
thankfulness
innumerable
experiments
from
the
rio
grande
southward
had
demonstrated
that
the
american
aboriginal
has
not
a
trace
of
gratitude
in
his
indeed
the
use
of
the
spanish
term
suggests
that
the
native
language
did
not
even
include
a
word
for
thanks
the
thirst
that
follows
an
tramp
outlived
the
available
supply
of
water
and
even
the
bottle
of
pisco
i
dared
not
bring
to
light
until
darkness
had
concealed
my
movements
from
the
indians
could
not
be
shared
with
chusquito
no
doubt
choking
within
in
spite
of
his
bedraggled
dripping
flanks
as
the
storm
died
down
the
evening
spread
wonderful
colors
across
this
bleak
upper
world
bringing
out
in
lilac
tints
shading
to
purple
and
then
to
black
the
range
bounding
the
horizon
on
the
far
south
the
night
would
have
been
bitter
cold
even
inside
one
of
the
huts
to
say
nothing
of
lying
on
the
earth
floor
of
the
open
mud
corredor
yet
the
cold
which
my
rubber
poncho
kept
out
was
no
less
surprising
than
the
heat
which
the
wooly
one
kept
in
and
my
sleep
might
easily
have
been
much
more
broken
than
it
was
during
my
first
doze
there
arrived
an
old
indian
evidently
the
head
of
the
household
that
had
hitherto
kept
itself
successfully
concealed
he
was
somewhat
the
worse
for
fiery
waters
and
being
apprized
of
his
visitor
set
up
a
deal
of
howling
and
shouting
in
quichua
receiving
no
answer
he
ventured
to
take
a
mild
poke
at
me
with
his
stick
it
would
have
been
heroic
indeed
to
have
gotten
out
of
instead
i
turned
loose
a
string
of
american
and
spanish
words
of
high
voltage
which
experience
had
shown
to
have
a
withering
effect
on
his
race
though
he
did
not
understand
them
individually
he
evidently
grasped
their
general
import
for
he
subsided
at
once
and
retired
to
the
beehive
kitchen
where
for
a
long
time
he
howled
and
yelped
as
brave
men
will
in
the
midst
of
their
trembling
and
admiring
families
bit
by
bit
his
women
pacified
him
in
the
way
women
have
perhaps
with
more
pisco
and
coca
for
i
heard
him
laugh
several
times
thereafter
with
a
sound
like
that
of
a
choking
cow
before
anything
resembling
silence
settled
down
over
the
lofty
world
real
silence
is
rare
in
these
indian
huts
at
night
either
the
lack
of
comfort
they
are
too
lazy
or
uninitiative
to
remedy
or
the
chewing
of
coca
keeps
the
miserable
inhabitants
and
periods
of
growling
and
grumbling
are
seldom
far
apart
from
dark
to
dawn
i
fancy
it
was
midnight
more
or
less
when
i
became
drowsily
aware
that
chusquito
tied
within
a
foot
of
my
head
was
munching
some
fodder
i
knew
he
did
not
possess
but
i
was
too
nearly
asleep
to
rise
and
investigate
the
moon
testified
that
it
was
some
two
hours
later
when
i
was
awakened
to
find
the
head
of
the
household
standing
beside
me
his
hand
on
a
damaged
roof
and
bellowing
a
guttural
stream
in
which
i
caught
several
times
the
words
huasi
my
this
would
be
an
impoliteness
in
any
land
and
i
bravely
forced
myself
to
slip
into
my
brogans
and
out
into
the
icy
moonlight
chusquito
had
scalloped
out
the
bangs
of
the
grass
roof
in
a
new
style
that
to
my
notion
was
more
fetching
than
the
original
if
only
the
indians
of
the
andes
were
not
so
stonily
conservative
my
host
would
have
thanked
me
for
the
improvement
instead
of
sputtering
with
rage
i
tied
the
innocent
culprit
to
a
nearby
which
was
also
an
unfortunate
choice
for
i
heard
him
knock
down
most
of
that
in
the
hours
that
remained
before
daylight
during
the
long
uproar
that
ensued
in
the
kitchen
no
doubt
the
old
indian
told
his
family
many
times
over
that
had
been
at
home
when
i
arrived
i
should
not
have
remained
but
in
that
he
was
mistaken
for
it
would
have
taken
a
considerable
band
of
south
american
indians
to
have
denied
me
hospitality
i
lay
down
again
with
my
revolver
and
handy
under
the
edge
of
the
ponchos
not
that
there
was
any
danger
but
because
i
do
not
care
to
be
numbered
among
those
who
take
foolish
chances
the
next
i
knew
distinctly
it
was
dawning
i
fed
my
mattress
to
chusquito
and
set
up
my
kitchenette
in
the
most
sheltered
corner
of
the
corredor
bent
on
concocting
a
hot
broth
with
a
lump
of
ice
from
the
bottom
of
a
leaning

the
directions
on
my
magic
can
of
concentrated
soup
asserted
that
one
cube
with
hot
water
makes
a
delicious
but
this
experience
had
demonstrated
should
be
taken
with
a
grain
of
four
other
cubes
even
under
the
lee
of
my
alforjas

went
out
at
the
faintest
breath
of
wind
but
by
constant
coaxing
and
at
the
imminent
risk
of
setting
fire
to
my
possessions
i
managed
even
to
boil
the
two
eggs
that
remained
whole
though
so
great
was
the
altitude
that
with
eight
minutes
of
boiling
they
were
still
soft
gravelly
bread
of
huancavelica
and
a
native
chocolate
that
was
really
a
pebbly
brown
sugar
topped
off
a
meal
i
might
have
longed
for
in
vain
at
that
hour
in
the
best
hotel
of
peru
many
an
hour
on
the
road
during
the
best
part
of
the
day
for
walking
that
simple
little
contrivance
gave
me
when
i
should
otherwise
have
been
waiting
on
the
sleepy
natives
for
breakfast
by
the
time
i
had
eaten
the
householder
appeared
in
his
slit
panties
with
white
buttons
down
the
sides
and
a
fancy
upper
garment
evidently
intended
to
impress
me
with
his
importance
but
when
he
noted
by
daylight
with
whom
he
had
to
do
he
gradually
shrivelled
up
to
a
smile
and
accepted
with
a
pretence
of
gratitude
a
coin
for
his
forced
hospitality
and
newly
decorated
roof
a
black
cane
leaning
against
what
chusquito
had
seen
fit
to
leave
of
the
stone
wall
proved
him
one
of
the
authorities
of
the
region
above
it
stood
a
crude
cross
decorated
with
dry
grass
designed
to
keep
evil
those
in
from
the
cluster
of
huts
either
my
host
s
knowledge
of
the
trail
ahead
or
his
manner
of
imparting
it
was
extremely
hazy
and
i
dragged
chusquito
away
across
the
pampa
in
the
cutting
cold
but
invigorating
mountain
air
burdened
with
the
task
of
finding
ourselves
once
more
within
an
hour
we
were
so
fortunate
as
to
fall
again
upon
a
trail
where
i
could
relinquish
the
tiller
and
drift
into
those
that
come
upon
the
solitary
traveler
across
these
vast
andean
punas
snow
had
fallen
during
the
night
and
a
great
white
immensity
slightly
undulating
spread
out
to
infinity
before
us
we
shared
an
thirst
that
set
us
both
to
munching
snow
at
frequent
intervals
by
ten
the
sun
had
burned
away
the
whiteness
and
restored
to
the
scene
its
accustomed
monk
s
robe
of
faded
all
morning
i
continued
to
guess
the
way
across
a
steadily
rising
world
in
the
utter
silence
that
makes
more
impressive
the
dreariness
of
these
lofty
regions
until
at
noon
we
panted
over
a
jagged
from
which
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
lay
spread
out
below
us
tumbled
broken
and
velvety
brown
as
far
as
the
eye
could
command
even
in
this
transparent
air
as
we
started
gradually
downward
shepherds
and
their
flocks
appeared
once
more
then
little
fenced
patches
and
hovels
then
we
dropped
almost
suddenly
into
the
blazing
hot
valley
of
a
little
river
along
which
tiled
huts
and
travelers
were
numerous
several
times
i
went
astray
and
waged
pitched
battle
with
chusquito
past
hovels
swarming
like
disturbed
beehives
with
barking
dogs
before
i
once
more
got
securely
under
our
feet
the
trail
that
was
to
lead
us
upward
again
over
the
next
páramo
it
is
not
merely
that
the
stupid
inhabitants
of
these
regions
speak
only
quichua
but
they
are
incapable
of
giving
intelligent
directions
even
in
that
tongue
there
is
something
exhilarating
in
the
air
of
andean
heights
that
breeds
reflection
and
a
peaceful
serenity
of
mind
but
it
is
nature
rather
than
humanity
that
awakens
the
marked
optimism
of
spirits
the
traveler
grows
inspired
lifted
up
out
of
himself
by
the
magnificence
of
the
scene
realizing
for
a
moment
how
marvelous
is
this
world
we
inhabit
then
suddenly
an
indian
a
human
being
intrudes
and
snatches
him
back
to
earth
again
time
after
time
i
caught
sight
of
an
approaching
figure
which
the
mind
from
youthful
force
of
habit
imbued
with
human
as
many
times
it
turned
out
to
be
a
shuffling
indian
stupid
and
from
the
quid
of
coca
in
his
cheek
and
the
chicha
and
pisco
of
the
last
hamlet
in
his
belly
who
cringed
like
some
degenerate
animal
as
he
passed
mumbling
some
quichua
monosyllable
incapable
of
intelligent
reply
even
when
they
are
not
in
a
stupor
these
plodding
creatures
have
a
very
hazy
notion
of
distance
the
or
time
of
duration
of
a
quid
of
coca
which
they
throw
on
the
or
symbolical
along
the
way
is
at
best
but
an
uncertain
term
of
length
and
their
besotted
intellects
seldom
retain
the
memory
of
any
number
above
three
or
four
so
that
in
spite
of
the
frequent
appearance
of
i
had
perforce
to
be
satisfied
with
the
that
i
was
on
the
right
road
without
any
notion
of
whether
the
nearest
shelter
was
one
or
ten
leagues
distant
clouds
crawled
into
the
evening
sky
again
where
the
daytime
sunshine
had
swept
it
clean
the
purple
shadows
of
the
mountains
across
the
tops
of
which
the
setting
sun
cast
a
crimson
glow
spread
and
darkened
and
i
had
visions
of
shivering
out
another
night
in
the
corredor
of
an
indian
hut
or
out
on
the
bare
freezing
pampa
i
had
suffered
so
many
dreary
nights
twelve
hours
long
in
south
america
that
it
had
become
a
habit
to
lose
my
cheerful
mood
in
the
late
afternoon
and
succumb
to
apprehension
as
of
some
impending
misfortune
under
this
i
developed
unconsciously
a
pace
so
swift
that
chusquito
like
a
small
boy
trying
to
keep
up
with
an
inconsiderate
father
took
to
trotting
every
little
while
some
distance
ahead
we
were
now
far
up
again
on
a
cold
puna
across
which
the
bitter
mountain
wind
swept
unchecked
and
even
my
companion
seemed
to
cast
apprehensive
glances
at
the
angry
black
clouds
overspreading
the
sky
and
at
the
cold
dusk
descending
upon
us
we
hurried
unbrokenly
on
without
a
sign
of
town
or
hamlet
though
the
last
indian
stragglers
still
bore
sufficient
evidences
of
intoxication
that
proved
it
could
be
no
great
distance
off
then
in
the
last
rays
of
daylight
we
turned
a
boulder
and
caught
sight
of
the
place
far
off
in
the
lap
of
a
stony
valley
well
aware
from
long
andean
experience
that
the
intervening
distance
was
much
greater
than
appearance
suggested
black
night
had
long
since
settled
down
when
i
found
myself
surrounded
by
indistinct
low
structures
that
turned
out
to
be
acobamba
home
of
one
zambrano
for
whom
i
bore
a
letter
from
the
as
often
as
i
inquired
for
him
however
there
came
back
that
mumble
of
indifference
and
distrust
más
arriba
up
until
i
felt
like
a
district
attorney
on
the
trail
of
when
a
youth
in
store
clothes
gave
me
the
same
identical
lackadaisical
answer
for
the
tenth
or
twentieth
time
i
caught
him
by
the
slack
of
the
garments
and
jerked
him
into
the
street
with
a
polite
ultimatum
to
conduct
me
in
person
to
that
elusive
upper
region
he
led
the
interminable
cobbled
way
down
one
street
and
up
another
equally
unlighted
and
finally
stopped
before
a
zaguán
with
an
aquí
i
cut
off
his
proposed
escape
and
drove
him
into
the
patio
to
summon
the
man
of
the
house
he
returned
with
the
indian
mayordomo
and
the
information
that
the
zambrano
who
lived
there
was
not
the
one
i
sought
and
was
moreover
out
of
town
the
youth
proposed
that
he
go
look
for
the
right
zambrano
no
indeed
my
friend
i
countered
you
will
stay
right
with
me
while
look
for
sí
señor
said
the
youth
in
a
shivering
voice
then
he
turned
back
across
town
and
plaza
by
another
route
and
pointed
out
the
zambrano
household
exactly
two
doors
from
the
one
out
of
which
i
had
originally
snatched
him
the
flock
of
women
who
surged
out
upon
me
greeted
me
with
the
threadbare
no
stá
cá
he
never
i
bore
a
letter
to
him
the
wife
spelled
it
out
laboriously
under
the
blinking
light
of
a
tallow
candle
then
invited
me
into
the
parlor
separated
by
a
calico
curtain
from
the
little
shop
she
kept
there
is
no
one
in
acobamba
who
prepares
food
for
strangers
she
replied
to
my
roundabout
hint
but
we
shall
serve
you
such
as
we
can
here
in
our
poor
while
the
mystery
to
come
was
cooking
i
managed
to
get
inoffensively
into
her
possession
the
price
of
a
peck
of
grain
for
some
time
later
found
the
poor
misused
animal
munching
about
two
cents
worth
of
old
dry
in
the
corral
it
is
murmured
the
wife
in
reply
to
my
questioning
gesture
that
there
is
no
grain
in
these
but
though
she
would
have
considered
an
insult
any
direct
offer
of
a
traveler
consigned
to
her
husband
by
letter
to
pay
for
his
accommodation
she
carefully
avoided
any
further
reference
to
the
it
would
have
been
in
the
highest
degree
scandalous
to
have
lodged
a
stranger
in
her
own
dwelling
during
the
absence
of
the
head
of
the
household
but
the
delegation
of
females
having
discovered
by
dint
of
turning
the
house
out
the
massive
key
of
a
door
across
the
street
let
me
into
an
abandoned
shop
lumbered
with
the
accumulated
odds
and
ends
of
many
years
an
immense
hogshead
full
of
shelled
corn
bulking
above
the
rest
a
creaking
board
counter
barely
five
feet
long
was
the
only
available
sleeping
space
the
only
means
of
avoiding
asphyxiation
was
to
leave
the
door
open
to
any
passing
or
congenital
hater
of
gringos
but
even
had
the
risk
been
great
the
key
would
have
proved
an
effective
weapon
unfortunately
it
would
have
been
to
have
felled
with
it
the
solicitous
who
called
my
frequent
attention
to
the
perils
of
night
air
not
merely
by
rapping
on
the
door
but
by
prodding
me
in
the
ribs
with
their
sticks
it
was
butchering
day
in
acobamba
when
i
awoke
and
at
the
suggestion
of
my
hostess
i
sent
a
servant
to
buy
ten
cents
worth
of
meat
she
returned
with
an
entire
basketful
slabs
of
raw
red
beef
each
as
large
as
an
honest
sirloin
steak
for
virtually
every
shop
in
town
being
a
pulpería
it
was
easy
to
lay
in
supplies
for
the
road
ahead
but
though
competition
was
brisk
in
all
other
wares
for
some
reason
i
was
never
able
to
fathom
in
all
the
region
of
the
central
andes
my
favorite
food
was
always
hedged
round
with
refusals
as
often
as
i
stepped
into
a
shop
where
a
basket
of
eggs
was
displayed
i
was
sure
to
be
informed
in
a
dull
uninviting
monotone
no
están
de
of
course
they
are
not
for
sale
the
experienced
peruvian
wayfarer
soon
learns
to
reply
no
andean
lady
who
considers
herself
a
lady
would
think
of
selling
eggs
picking
out
the
largest
specimens
of
the
fruit
in
i
have
taken
a
dozen
how
much
the
answer
was
sure
to
be
a
meek
dos
cents
over
the
lofty
tumbled
world
ahead
the
way
was
often
so
steep
and
stony
and
contorted
that
chusquito
more
than
once
fell
on
his
neck
and
threatened
to
twist
himself
permanently
out
of
shape
it
was
a
land
so
dry
and
barren
that
only
the
of
pisco
kept
my
thirst
endurable
whenever
i
paused
for
a
sip
my
companion
glanced
furtively
and
anxiously
back
at
me
as
if
he
remembered
other
masters
who
had
got
bad
tempers
out
of
bottles
along
the
way
but
his
was
none
of
your
meek
and
canine
dispositions
that
permit
abuse
unprotestingly
on
the
level
high
pampas
with
all
the
world
spread
out
in
full
view
about
us
the
exhilaration
of
scene
and
air
caused
me
unconsciously
to
set
so
swift
a
pace
that
i
was
obliged
frequently
to
kick
the
brute
out
from
under
my
he
retaliated
by
suddenly
projecting
one
small
shod
hoof
against
a
shin
that
i
was
distinctly
aware
of
for
days
afterward
one
afternoon
not
fifty
miles
beyond
acobamba
i
was
threatened
with
violence
for
the
first
time
during
my
fifteen
months
in
south
america
i
sat
beside
a
mountain
pool
coaxing
my
under
shelter
of
my
alforjas
when
two
with
drink
appeared
on
stout
mules
they
had
nearly
passed
when
they
caught
sight
of
me
and
charged
forward
in
drunken
insolence
all
but
trampling
my
possessions
under
the
hoofs
of
their
animals
in
the
haste
of
the
moment
i
made
the
error
of
showing
aggressiveness
to
the
point
of
drawing
my
came
perilously
near
having
to
use
it
for
my
mistake
when
reflection
caused
me
to
change
my
tactics
and
humor
them
like
the
witless
children
they
were
the
danger
was
dissipated
like
a
puff
of
smoke
within
ten
minutes
the
pair
grew
so
maudlinly
affectionate
that
they
insisted
on
shaking
hands
alternately
a
dozen
times
each
and
at
length
rode
slowly
away
casting
frequent
besotted
loving
glances
behind
them
across
a
barren
páramo
ahead
the
mood
struck
me
to
cheer
the
long
hours
with
my
even
the
indian
carries
one
of
these
or
a
reed
flute
on
his
journeys
and
whiles
away
the
solitudes
with
monotonous
ditties
but
i
was
soon
forced
to
forgo
the
pleasure
not
merely
did
that
plebian
instrument
in
the
hands
of
a
gringo
bring
glances
of
unconcealed
contempt
from
the
rare
horsemen
who
passed
but
i
could
no
sooner
strike
up
than
chusquito
unhumanly
frank
and
honest
in
his
criticisms
would
lay
back
his
ears
and
trot
ahead
well
out
of
hearing
with
some
peril
to
my
pack
before
he
would
consent
to
fall
again
into
a
walk
chapter
xv
the
route
of
the
conquistadores
it
was
in
the
scattered
of
marcas
that
i
overtook
a
traveling
piano
i
had
barely
installed
myself
by
force
and
strategy
in
a
mud
den
and
tied
chusquito
to
a
tree
before
a
heap
of
straw
in
which
he
alternately
rolled
and
ate
when
a
party
of
arrived
among
them
an
old
woman
of
the
chola
class
carried
astride
the
shoulders
of
an
indian
their
chief
spokesman
was
a
lawyer
named
anchorena
a
white
man
of
some
education
and
even
a
slight
inkling
of
geography
who
was
importing
an
upright
piano
for
his
mansion
in
ayacucho
with
the
descending
night
came
a
score
of
indians
carrying
a
large
crude
harp
several
fifes
and
guitars
and
a
drum
to
install
themselves
along
the
mud
benches
of
the
corredor
of
the
building
inside
which
the
more
or
less
gente
had
spread
themselves
it
is
never
the
peruvian
s
way
to
interfere
with
the
celebrations
of
his
underlings
however
disturbing
these
may
be
and
far
into
the
night
the
musicians
kept
up
an
unbroken
dismal
tuneless
indigenous
wail
that
forced
whoever
would
be
heard
to
shout
anchorena
professionally
inclined
to
like
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
best
bellowed
the
evening
through
in
an
endless
account
of
a
s
visit
to
new
york
a
bare
ten
years
before
of
all
the
marvelous
experience
what
seemed
to
astonish
both
the
teller
and
his
hearers
most
all
but
choking
the
old
woman
with
incredulity
as
often
as
he
repeated
it
was
the
alleged
fact
that
in
the
best
new
york
hotels
guests
were
not
permitted
to
spit
on
the
floor
come
to
think
of
it
that
probably
would
astonish
a
peruvian
to
my
surprise
the
natives
were
off
ahead
of
us
in
the
morning
and
chusquito
had
picked
his
way
many
hundred
feet
down
a
trail
before
we
sighted
the
boxed
piano
lying
on
its
back
on
a
bit
of
level
ground
far
below
with
some
indians
squatted
about
it
the
lawyer
shook
hands
effusively
and
putting
chusquito
in
charge
of
the
barefoot
squire
who
was
leading
his
own
coast
horse
invited
me
to
listen
to
his
endless
chatter
while
we
continued
the
swift
descent
together
the
piano
made
in
germany
had
been
set
down
in
lima
for
freight
to
huancayo
had
added
ten
percent
to
the
cost
from
the
end
of
the
railway
to
ayacucho
a
scant
two
hundred
miles
the
exotic
plaything
must
be
transported
on
men
s
backs
as
the
incas
imported
a
thousand
not
the
days
of
their
power
this
stage
of
the
journey
would
under
ordinary
circumstances
have
nearly
doubled
the
cost
of
the
instrument
but
anchorena
had
the
advantage
of
owning
a
large
hacienda
in
the
great
hot
valley
toward
which
we
were
descending
and
was
able
to
cut
the
expense
in
two
by
drawing
upon
his
own
peons
for
the
labor
of
transportation
three
distinct
gangs
had
been
sent
from
his
estate
each
to
bear
the
burden
a
third
of
the
distance
they
were
paid
the
extraordinary
wage
of
twenty
cents
a
day
and
supplied
food
chicha
and
coca
each
gang
carried
the
piano
for
a
week
and
it
was
the
second
party
celebrating
the
arrival
of
the
third
that
had
made
noisy
the
night
at
marcas
each
morning
shortly
after
midnight
the
indians
rose
to
munch
or
boiled
corn
for
an
hour
or
more
after
which
a
heavy
soup
of
corn
potatoes
beans
and
charqui
was
served
then
for
another
hour
the
men
poked
coca
leaves
one
by
one
into
their
cheeks
mixing
them
with
lime
from
their
little
gourds
and
by
dawn
the
effect
of
the
chewing
having
made
itself
felt
they
rose
to
their
feet
and
were
off
some
forty
peons
set
their
shoulders
to
the
several
poles
attached
to
the
boxed
piano
a
with
shovels
axes
and
ropes
was
thrown
out
in
advance
to
widen
the
trail
and
lend
assistance
in
the
steeper
places
and
an
army
of
servants
cooks
squires
and
the
numerous
or
bosses
required
for
any
effective
indian
labor
brought
up
the
rear
of
the
expedition
from
the
punas
of
the
day
before
totally
barren
but
for
the
dreary
yellow
ichu
we
had
descended
through
a
zone
of
scrub
bushes
lower
still
through
thirstless
cactus
and
were
now
dropping
swiftly
through
a
dead
desert
landscape
by
zigzag
trails
as
painfully
steep
and
unpeopled
as
those
of
the
boundary
architecture
changed
with
the
altitude
so
that
the
openwork
huts
became
little
more
than
thatch
roofs
on
poles
shading
the
languid
loafing
inhabitants
of
a
place
called
huarpo
hot
as
panama
on
the
edge
of
a
river
cutting
off
a
broad
sandy
valley
i
had
seen
from
the
sky
the
day
before
the
surrounding
region
was
a
that
is
it
belonged
to
some
wooden
saint
to
whom
it
had
been
bequeathed
by
a
one
of
the
many
pious
old
women
who
have
thus
left
great
tracts
of
the
andes
perpetually
in
morte
main
for
the
desire
of
these
sanctimonious
matrons
is
to
provide
a
permanent
income
for
the
masses
requisite
to
the
repose
of
their
souls
and
as
their
piety
is
commonly
tempered
with
experience
of
the
ways
of
this
world
they
usually
reject
the
suggestion
of
the
church
to
sell
the
property
and
give
the
money
directly
to
the
priest
lest
he
grow
forgetful
in
a
way
even
priests
have
and
neglect
his
duty
toward
the
dwellers
in
purgatory
huarpo
is
also
paludic
or
raging
with
intermittent
fevers
and
no
wise
man
drinks
water
within
sight
of
it
the
appearance
of
a
gringo
in
their
midst
aroused
even
these
languid
desert
people
to
an
unusual
concentration
of
attention
one
bedraggled
female
bursting
out
at
last
with
a
remark
in
quichua
too
rapid
for
my
ears
but
which
the
lawyer
translated
caramba
si
yo
estaba
preñada
de
seguro
saldría
la
cara
gringuita
it
is
a
common
superstition
in
the
andes
that
a
child
will
closely
resemble
the
person
the
mother
has
looked
most
fixedly
upon
during
the
months
before
its
birth
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
everything
i
owned
in
south
america
not
only
my
letter
of
credit
and
the
papers
necessary
to
prove
my
identity
but
even
my
money
had
been
left
in
my
alforjas
under
the
tender
care
of
an
indian
boy
miles
behind
i
did
little
worrying
the
andean
traveler
soon
grows
accustomed
to
trusting
his
possessions
to
penniless
peons
for
losses
are
astonishingly
rare
for
all
that
i
caught
myself
glancing
anxiously
now
and
then
up
the
wall
of
shale
and
loose
rock
that
piled
into
the
sky
above
us
the
made
good
time
in
spite
of
many
a
zigzag
and
desert
precipice
where
rope
and
tackle
and
the
widening
of
the
trail
were
often
necessary
we
had
not
enjoyed
the
shade
of
the
huts
an
hour
before
the
vanguard
appeared
and
shortly
afterward
the
lawyer
s
bulky
toy
was
laid
in
the
baking
sand
beside
us
and
the
sweating
carriers
swarmed
about
the
huge
jar
of
de
that
had
been
purchased
for
them
progress
would
have
been
much
less
rapid
but
for
the
fact
that
the
third
gang
knowing
theirs
was
the
last
shift
realized
the
advantage
of
finishing
the
journey
to
ayacucho
as
soon
as
possible
yet
their
conception
of
hurrying
was
not
exactly
vertiginous
they
halted
a
long
hour
not
to
eat
which
they
did
only
morning
and
evening
but
to
prepare
new
quids
of
coca
from
a
large
the
lawyer
dealt
out
to
each
of
the
peons
with
his
own
fair
hand
a
small
handful
of
the
narcotic
leaves
they
slunk
forward
one
by
one
with
outstretched
hats
and
a
hint
of
eagerness
on
their
besotted
expressionless
faces
with
the
air
of
men
who
would
have
sold
their
souls
for
this
few
cents
worth
of
brutalizing
leaves
illustration
on
the
road
to
ayacucho
i
overtook
a
lawyer
who
was
importing
a
piano
it
required
three
gangs
of
indians
and
nearly
a
month
s
time
to
transport
the
instrument
less
than
miles
from
the
end
of
the
railway
line
illustration
carrying
the
piano
across
one
of
the
typical
bridges
of
the
peruvian
andes
in
many
places
the
trail
had
to
be
widened
or
recut

the
instrument
had
now
and
then
to
be
let
down
or
hauled
up
with
ropes

had
appeared
at
last
all
intact
but
as
covered
with
fine
sand
as
from
a
trip
across
the
sahara
was
too
tiny
to
have
crossed
the
river
without
wetting
my
baggage
it
was
the
coast

that
saved
me
a
detour
of
several
miles
to
a
bridge
downstream
except
for
the
lawyer
and
his
mayordomos
the
expedition
stripped
to
the
waist
and
forded
the
stream

inch
under
the
piano
slipping
individually
but
fortunately
not
in
unison
on
the
stones
at
the
bottom
and
spending
a
in
a
precarious
task
that
would
have
been
impossible
in
any
but
the
dry
season
in
the
shade
of
a
molle
grove
beyond
anchorena
who
had
recently
been
won
to
methods
dealt
out
a
quinine
pill
to
each
of
the
indians
few
were
able
to
swallow
them
without
chewing
and
made
wry
faces
and
animal
noises
in
consequence
several
surreptitiously
got
rid
of
the
detested
white
man
s
remedy
while
their
master
s
eyes
were
not
upon
them
though
the
day
was
still
young
the
cavalcade
was
to
camp
on
the
edge
of
the
drowsy
town
of
izcutaco
a
bare
mile
above
the
river
and
when
i
left
them
the
cooks
were
already
heating
over
a
blazing
fire
of
molle
berries
the
enormous
iron
kettle
six
feet
in
diameter
under
which
an
indian
had
plodded
bent
double
all
day
when
i
took
leave
of
the
lawyer
he
hoped
to
reach
ayacucho
in
four
days
making
the
journey
from
huancayo
three
weeks
in
duration
at
a
total
cost
of
about
without
reckoning
the
labor
lost
on
his
hacienda
while
the
three
gangs
were
going
and
coming
and
recuperating
from
their
unwonted
toil
the
molle
tree
covered
all
the
great
tilted
plain
before
me
lending
it
an
inviting
green
tinge
in
spite
of
its
character
its
leaves
are
not
unlike
those
of
the
willow
and
it
produces
in
clusters
great
quantities
of
a
peppery
red
berry
somewhat
resembling
the
currant
in
appearance
and
those
of
our
red
cedar
in
taste
these
are
well
supplied
with
saccharine
and
ferment
readily
constituting
the
chief
curse
of
the
region
in
the
form
of
an
intoxicant
so
cheap
and
plentiful
that
the
inhabitants
are
more
often
drunk
than
working
in
huanta
the
addressee
of
my
turkish
letter
was
don
emilio
a
hearty
countryman
pleasantly
free
from
the
tiresome
polish
of
the
early
in
our
conversation
he
took
pains
to
inform
me
that
he
never
permitted
a
priest
to
cross
his
threshold
a
later
confided
to
me
that
the
prohibition
dated
from
the
day
that
the
oldest
daughter
of
my
host
had
been
betrayed
through
the
ministrations
of
the
confessional
there
was
something
pleasantly
reminiscent
of
old
patriarchial
days
in
the
way
we
all
sat
at
meat
together
around
the
long
table
in
the
back
corredor
surrounded
by
a
flock
of
servants
the
older
girls
rising
now
and
then
during
the
meal
to
tend
shop
yet
it
is
not
easy
to
make
oneself
agreeable
to
such
a
family
for
lack
of
intellectual
interests
cuts
down
the
conversation
to
the
simplest
matters
the
women
of
the
household
preferred
the
guttural
quichua
but
don
emilio
found
that
tongue
more
difficult
than
his
accustomed
spanish
my
host
was
one
of
the
city
fathers
and
perhaps
the
man
in
the
community
yet
he
referred
to
the
united
states
and
europe
as
a
place
somewhere
up
the
coast
and
desired
to
know
whether
italy
was
in
new
york
or
new
york
in
italy
i
attempted
in
my
struggle
to
make
conversation
to
give
the
family
some
conception
of
our
northern
midwinters
brr
nearly
as
cold
as
huancavelica
it
must
be
shivered
the
wife
how
high
is
the
highest
andes
in
your
united
states
asked
don
emilio
with
a
hint
of
suspicion
in
his
voice
i
told
him
then
it
is
impossible
for
it
to
be
cold
there
he
cried
conclusively
for
that
is
scarcely
higher
than
huanta
huanta
lies
close
to
the
great
or
amazonian
and
the
chocolate
de
huanta
is
famous
throughout
peru
but
the
trails
to
that
fruitful
region
are
so
nearly
impassable
that
the
interchange
of
products
is
only
a
fraction
of
what
it
might
be
set
in
one
of
the
dry
belts
that
are
so
frequent
in
the
andes
the
great
tilted
plain
depends
on
irrigation
for
most
of
its
fruits
molle
fig
and
willow
trees
abound
yet
the
ground
beneath
them
is
barren
of
grass
eighty
percent
of
the
valley
is
said
to
be
chiefly
indian
in
blood
peons
are
paid
an
average
of
twelve
cents
a
day
and
judging
from
what
i
saw
of
them
they
are
grossly
overpaid
nearly
a
ago
squier
found
drunkenness
universal
throughout
the
sierra
and
nothing
neglected
that
could
be
turned
into
intoxicating
to
this
day
there
is
slight
improvement
in
this
respect
thanks
to
the
molle
berry
intemperance
is
high
even
for
peru
and
laziness
reaches
its
culmination
during
the
season
when
the
ripening
on
the
cactus
hedges
feed
alike
birds
and
indians
in
the
town
almost
every
hut
is
a
little
drunkery
with
an
inviting
display
of
bottles
of
all
shapes
and
sizes
the
life
of
the
place
was
typified
by
a
lump
of
a
man
sitting
in
the
shade
of
his
shop
drowsily
switching
flies
off
himself
with
a
horse
s
tail
mounted
on
a
wooden
handle
to
have
seen
him
reading
a
book
or
even
whittling
a
stick
would
have
been
entirely
out
of
keeping
with
the
local
color
unknown
in
the
upper
altitudes
were
more
than
numerous
cats
too
were
in
evidence
for
almost
the
first
time
in
the
sierra
the
assertion
of
scientists
that
these
can
not
endure
high
regions
was
denied
by
the
natives
who
attributed
their
absence
elsewhere
to
the
lack
of
rats
to
feed
on
dogs
unfortunately
are
indifferent
to
either
drawback
and
the
andean
town
has
yet
to
be
discovered
that
does
not
swarm
with
them
llamas
avoid
huanta
and
the
climate
is
more
fitted
to
donkeys
than
to
mountain
ponies
an
indian
trotted
in
from
one
of
the
irrigated
on
the
edge
of
town
with
a
of
fresh
green
alfalfa
gay
with
purple
and
red
flowers
soon
after
our
arrival
but
at
the
first
taste
of
this
new
species
of
fodder
chusquito
showed
keen
disappointment
like
myself
he
preferred
regions
of
ten
thousand
feet
and
upward
during
most
of
our
stay
he
hung
sad
and
dejected
as
if
homesick
for
the
cold
penetrating
air
and
the
wiry
grass
of
his
native
mountains
and
it
was
here
that
i
saw
him
lie
down
for
the
first
time
since
we
had
joined
forces
we
pushed
on
to
ayacucho
under
no
very
auspicious
circumstances
for
the
department
capital
was
reported
to
be
raging
with
an
epidemic
of
typhoid
and
smallpox
that
had
forced
it
to
ask
aid
of
the
central
government
the
day
s
tramp
varied
from
a
blazing
gorge
to
a
barren
waterless
range
so
lofty
that
i
found
it
necessary
to
stretch
out
on
my
back
at
the
summit
to
catch
my
breath
a
contrary
mood
or
too
long
a
rest
made
chusquito
choose
to
be
obstreperous
beyond
all
custom
and
twice
he
set
his
heart
wilfully
on
branch
trails
and
came
perilously
near
escaping
with
all
my
possessions
thereafter
i
kept
him
tied
to
my
belt
and
for
once
he
set
a
pace
more
swift
than
i
would
have
had
it
early
in
the
afternoon
the
blazing
desert
landscape
was
broken
by
the
sight
of
a
city
that
could
have
been
no
other
than
ayacucho
filling
the
hollow
of
a
green
bowl
several
streets
radiating
upward
from
it
like
the
legs
of
some
great
tarantula
stretched
on
its
back
a
perfectly
level
road
seemed
to
promise
a
quick
entrance
but
almost
at
the
edge
of
the
town
the
world
fell
suddenly
away
into
a
bottomless
earthquake
crack
where
we
sweated
for
an
hour
in
a
headlong
descent
far
out
of
sight
of
human
habitation
and
toiled
upward
again
to
the
crest
of
the
horizon
all
to
advance
a
bare
five
hundred
yards
raging
with
thirst
we
strode
swiftly
down
upon
the
town
only
to
be
blocked
at
the
edge
of
it
by
a
religious
procession
of
hundreds
of
girls
in
dress
as
if
to
show
off
before
his
chusquito
redoubled
his
cussedness
and
persisted
in
spite
of
all
my
efforts
in
taking
advantage
of
the
smooth
flagstone
sidewalks
forcing
pedestrians
into
the
street
it
did
not
occur
to
me
that
he
too
might
be
footsore
at
the
first
open
door
through
which
i
spied
bottles
he
attempted
to
enter
with
me
and
watched
me
disgustedly
while
i
opened
a
bottle
of
native
a
second
then
a
third
until
the
proprietress
all
but
fainted
with
astonishment
at
sight
of
a
man
who
came
on
foot
drinking
up
a
whole
fifteen
cents
worth
at
actually
paying
for
it
both
the
hotels
of
ayacucho
were
the
usual
low
buildings
extending
around
a
large
court
one
entered
beneath
a
topheavy
archway
where
guests
appeared
to
be
considered
a
nuisance
to
be
avoided
by
both
host
and
servants
as
long
as
possible
i
was
finally
awarded
a
dungeon
opening
directly
on
all
the
assorted
activities
misdemeanors
and
indecencies
indigenous
to
the
cobbled
patios
of
andean
hotels
but
which
had
the
unusual
feature
of
a
wooden
bars
for
glass
is
a
luxury
even
in
an
important
department
capital
the
chamber
was
cool
to
the
point
of
sogginess
and
had
of
course
to
be
cleared
out
and
furnished
to
my
order
it
was
apparent
that
here
was
a
city
that
would
reward
several
days
stay
and
i
set
about
finding
more
fitting
accommodations
for
chusquito
than
the
circle
about
a
post
to
which
he
had
been
confined
at
every
halt
since
he
had
come
into
my
possession
long
search
and
persistent
inquiry
brought
me
to
a
professional
a
term
supposed
to
designate
a
green
pasture
in
which
an
animal
accepted
as
guest
can
wallow
and
gorge
to
his
heart
s

fortunately
i
am
nothing
if
not
sceptical
in
such
peruvian
matters
and
sure
enough
investigation
proved
the
place
to
be
only
a
bare
field
in
which
the
owner
promised
to
give
plenty
of
food
and
water
at
ten
cents
a
day
promises
and
starvation
are
too
closely
allied
in
the
andes
where
he
who
will
know
his
animal
well
fed
must
see
to
the
feeding
in
person
i
had
all
but
resigned
myself
and
the
maltreated
beast
to
the
inevitable
and
had
ordered
a
load
of
alfalfa
brought
to
the
hotel
patio
when
i
ran
across
the
piano
importer
who
begged
me
to
do
him
the
honor
of
letting
him
send
the
animal
to
his
farm
a
few
miles
out
of
town
when
at
last
i
got
to
bed
my
sleep
was
full
of
feverish
dreams
in
which
i
was
dragged
to
destruction
times
without
number
over
bottomless
precipices
by
a
rope
tied
to
my
belt
while
i
gazed
about
me
in
vain
for
a
patch
of
green
in
a
bald
and
blistered
landscape
at
first
sight
this
hole
in
the
ground
surrounded
by
stretches
of
loose
stones
and
bare
repulsive
mountains
seemed
a
queer
place
for
a
city
but
the
situation
improves
somewhat
upon
closer
acquaintance
under
the
scanty
trees
that
lend
the
hollow
its
color
the
soil
is
fertile
when
favored
by
the
rains
and
those
who
can
avoid
going
out
in
the
middle
of
the
day
will
find
the
climate
little
short
of
perfect
the
main
drawbacks
to
what
might
be
a
not
unpleasant
are
the
absence
of
even
the
rudiments
of
hygiene
and
the
whirlwinds
that
spring
up
often
with
sudden
unexpected
violence
and
envelop
the
town
in
clouds
of
dust
and
evidence
of
the
absence
of
or
bring
down
a
wintry
wave
from
the
snowclad
to
the
south
that
lends
its
contrast
to
the
picture
at
the
time
of
the
conquest
the
only
gathering
of
mankind
corresponding
to
the
present
city
was
what
prescott
calls
huamanga
midway
between
lima
and
the
story
runs
that
an
inca
passing
through
the
region
was
sitting
at
meat
when
he
saw
circling
above
him
a
magnificent
quichua
for
falcon
struck
with
admiration
he
held
up
a
choice
morsel
crying
huaman
ca
it
falcon
whatever
the
truth
of
the
legend
the
department
of
which
ayacucho
is
the
capital
is
still
known
as
huamanga
the
city
itself
takes
its
name
from
the
quichua
terms
corpse
and
corner
in
other
words
dead
man
s
long
before
the
arrival
of
the
spaniards
all
this
region
was
thus
known
because
of
a
great
battle
between
the
fierce
local
tribes
and
those
of
cuzco
in
which
the
latter
were
routed
but
the
tables
were
turned
under
huayna
ccápac
the
great
who
colonized
the
territory
by
the
customary
inca
method
of
settling
it
with
or
transplanted
people
from
another
province
the
great
military
highway
passed
close
to
the
present
site
but
the
only
town
of
any
size
between
huancayo
and
cuzco
in
early
colonial
days
was
huari
now
an
insignificant
indian
village
lost
among
the
stony
hills
manco
the
revolted
inca
and
his
followers
formed
the
chronic
habit
of
falling
upon
travelers
between
the
ancient
and
the
new
capital
of
peru
and
in
pizarro
ordered
a
city
founded
for
their
protection
usually
known
as
huamanga
not
until
after
what
is
known
to
history
as
the
battle
of
ayacucho
in
which
sucre
defeated
the
spanish
veterans
who
had
fled
before
bolívar
from
the
icy
pampa
of
junín
and
brought
to
an
end
the
struggle
of
the
new
world
for
political
freedom
begun
in
new
england
a
before
was
the
older
and
more
appropriate
name
revived
in
colonial
times
it
was
a
far
more
important
city
a
census
taken
by
a
german
in
showed
a
population
of
more
than
it
has
barely
two
inhabitants
for
each
of
its
feet
elevation
above
even
squier
found
it
laid
out
on
a
grand
scale
but
with
unmistakable
signs
of
a
great
decline
in
wealth
and
epidemics
of
smallpox
typhoid
and
yellow
fever
the
advance
of
machinery
and
foreign
importation
over
the
local
handicraft
manufacture
of
cloth
from
the
cactus
fiber
or
blankets
and
native
shoes
with
the
corresponding
decrease
in
the
growing
of
cotton
in
the
region
were
the
chief
causes
of
this
decline
then
too
the
building
of
railroads
left
the
ancient
route
from
lima
to
cuzco
stranded
and
only
a
rare
gringo
andarín
driving
a
shaggy
and
chusquito
comes
now
to
visit
the
once
proud
city
should
the
railway
across
peru
ever
come
to
pass
ayacucho
like
huancavelica
may
come
more
or
less
into
her
own
again
the
cities
of
our
own
land
are
not
without
their
faults
but
he
who
would
fully
realize
the
advantages
of
even
the
most
backward
of
them
should
come
and
dwell
for
a
time
in
one
of
these
shipwrecked
capitals
of
the
andes
by
night
ayacucho
is
lighted
by
dim
kerosene
contrivances
mildly
resembling
a
miner
s
torch
inside
square
lanterns
of
medieval
origin
each
paying
from
five
to
twenty
cents
a
month
for
his
share
of
the
illumination
gradually
however
electric
lights
were
being
pale
bulbs
indigenous
to
andean
which
a
considerable
opposition
had
developed
because
of
the
threatened
cost
of
nearly
a
dollar
monthly
to
each
householder
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
average
shop
rents
for
a
month
it
was
natural
that
so
decided
an
increase
in
expenses
should
be
resented
the
huge
main
plaza
is
garnished
only
with
a
central
fountain
surrounded
by
the
customary
iron
fence
due
to
the
untold
patriotism
of
juan
fulano
and
a
few
ancient
backless
benches
the
favorite
loafers
is
under
the
or
arcades
that
surround
the
square
on
three
sides
these
are
lined
with
shops
into
the
shadows
of
which
the
s
eyes
peer
gratefully
but
wellnigh
blindly
from
the
blazing
sunshine
outside
compared
even
with
spain
ayacucho
harbors
an
unbelievable
number
of
hundreds
of
little
shops
endlessly
duplicated
stretch
away
along
its
every
street
tended
by
lounging
men
and
women
with
no
other
desire
in
life
than
to
sell
a
few
cents
worth
of
something
particularly
strong
drink
and
not
even
desiring
that
very
decidedly
their
business
methods
are
crude
in
the
extreme
the
town
for
example
is
noted
for
its
native
chocolate
the
cacao
beans
grown
in
the
montaña
on
the
east
are
hulled
and
roasted
mixed
with
crude
sugar
and
vanilla
and
crushed
and
rolled
again
and
again
by
hand
under
stone
rollers
producing
a
gravelly
but
not
untoothsome
product
yet
though
every
merchant
in
town
is
ready
to
sell
these
individually
at
cents
a
cake
not
one
of
them
can
be
induced
to
sell
by
weight
no
es
costumbre
answers
every
man
woman
and
child
tending
shop
and
though
all
hover
on
the
verge
of
poverty
not
a
man
among
them
will
overstep
fixed
custom
even
to
this
extent
to
win
a
less
precarious
livelihood
for
a
country
where
trusts
are
unknown
the
entire
town
is
rather
staunchly
agreed
on
prices
the
money
in
use
is
almost
exclusively
silver
which
is
lugged
back
and
forth
through
the
streets
in
cotton
bags
many
of
the
coins
having
at
some
time
served
as
female
adornment
have
holes
in
them
and
though
these
are
perfectly
acceptable
to
ayacucho
they
are
worthless
elsewhere
in
the
country
so
that
to
my
usual
task
of
gathering
small
change
for
the
road
ahead
was
added
that
of
carefully
weeding
out
all
holed
pieces
the
average
ayacuchano
has
a
kind
of
crude
insolence
and
an
arrogance
bred
in
isolated
places
which
added
to
his
mountaineer
uncouthness
makes
him
not
over
pleasant
toward
me
they
assumed
a
suspicious
air
that
suggested
some
foreigner
had
once
long
ago
cheated
some
one
among
them
out
of
ten
cents
even
for
peruvians
the
plighted
word
of
every
grade
of
inhabitant
is
peculiarly
worthless
of
a
dozen
or
more
promises
of
larger
or
smaller
importance
made
me
during
my
stay
not
one
ever
reached
even
the
point
of
attempted
fulfilment
the
population
is
very
largely
in
diluted
genuinely
white
persons
are
decidedly
rare
certainly
not
ten
though
there
are
many
more
than
that
strutting
about
in
what
ayacucho
fancies
faultless
dress
who
consider
themselves
such
and
who
would
be
astonished
at
the
their
pretentions
would
receive
in
more
exacting
communities
the
town
swarms
with
tailors
chiefly
boys
and
youths
with
slight
ability
at
their
trade
who
sit
like
the
craftsmen
of
damascus
in
little
shops
the
entire
front
of
which
is
open
door
and
work
steadily
but
languidly
on
miserable
materials
that
barely
last
long
enough
for
purchaser
and
seller
to
part
their
attention
chiefly
on
whatever
passes
in
the
street
the
indians
of
the
region
still
weave
a
heavy
wool
frazada
of
astounding
combinations
of
color
and
the
town
is
somewhat
noted
for
the
filigree
work
and
for
which
it
was
once
famous
but
for
the
most
part
it
is
silent
smokeless
and
as
any
village
of
the
andes
without
a
single
wheeled
vehicle
to
rumble
over
its
cobbles
its
water
is
so
bad
that
even
the
natives
admitted
i
should
not
drink
it
indeed
i
did
not
even
dare
develop
films
in
it
not
that
its
source
is
but
in
the
several
miles
of
open
conduit
to
the
city
the
indians
make
free
use
of
it
for
any
of
their
lavatory
processes
the
local
quichua
dialect
varies
much
from
that
of
cuzco
the
florence
of
the
inca
tongue
so
that
indians
from
the
two
towns
understand
each
other
with
difficulty
ayacucho
is
about
as
badly
overdone
in
churches
as
any
town
in
south
america
in
colonial
days
a
religious
edifice
was
built
on
the
slightest
provocation
of
if
possible
of
cobbles
or
adobe
if
necessary
until
the
entire
population
might
be
housed
five
times
over
in
those
that
are
left
not
a
few
are
things
of
beauty
in
their
delapidation
the
cathedral
centuries
old
is
surpassed
in
all
peru
only
by
those
of
lima
and
cuzco
externally
and
at
some
distance
like
so
many
things
of
spanish
origin
it
has
an
imposing
and
not
inartistic
appearance
but
the
interior
is
disappointing
here
is
the
usual
garish
gaudiness
of
wooden
tin
and
porcelain
saints
with
no
suggestion
of
art
except
in
the
intricately
carved
wooden
pulpit
and
the
choir
stalls
flanking
the
altar
behind
each
of
the
latter
a
boy
stands
during
services
holding
a
candle
above
the
chanting
friar
whose
bulk
amply
fills
the
niche
a
spittoon
is
provided
for
each
of
the
singers
had
evidently
not
yet
come
into
style
an
unusual
feature
was
seats
for
the
congregation
which
in
most
churches
of
the
andes
is
left
to
kneel
on
the
bare
floor
or
to
bring
a
servant
carrying
a
it
was
the
first
place
in
peru
where
the
beating
of
reached
anything
like
the
hubbub
of
ecuador
or
colombia
for
ayacucho
is
so
fanatical
that
the
law
against
this
is
openly
disobeyed
sleek
priests
are
everywhere
in
evidence
scores
of
barefoot
friars
in
their
stout
leather
sandals
waddle
about
town
with
the
of
the
sacred
bulls
of
india
and
the
public
appearance
of
the
bishop
brings
all
activity
to
a
standstill
and
all
beholders
except
the
men
to
their
knees
illustration
the
striking
headdress
of
the
women
of
this
case
purple
embroidered
with
red
the
about
the
shoulders
is
blue
illustration
the
friendly
and
ingratiating
waiters
of
our
hotel
in
ayacucho
they
had
two
shoes
three
eyes
and
not
a
crumb
of
soap
between
them
one
wears
a
bright
pink
shirt
the
other
one
of
brilliant
maroon
as
in
most
centers
of
religious
fanaticism
the
town
reeks
with
poverty
even
for
south
america
the
overwhelming
display
of
rags
is
striking
and
ignorance
and
debauch
is
in
constant
evidence
yet
the
children
the
babies
particularly
sometimes
have
a
brightness
and
an
innocence
about
them
that
suggests
what
might
be
made
of
them
could
they
be
caught
young
very
very
young
and
taken
away
from
this
environment
of
dirt
and
ignorance
and
immorality
and
priests
yet
who
knows
the
more
one
travels
the
more
one
s
opinion
wavers
between
the
effects
of
ancestry
and
environment
it
has
been
said
of
ayacucho
that
her
chief
occupations
are
drinking
and
religious
processions
the
last
is
most
in
public
evidence
the
first
fiesta
to
break
out
after
my
arrival
was
that
of
the
virgen
de
las
all
shops
closed
for
the
occasion
and
the
entire
region
boomed
and
clanged
with
the
exertions
of
gangs
of
boys
filling
every
belfry
and
vying
with
each
other
in
adding
to
the
uproar
at
four
of
the
afternoon
when
the
sun
had
lost
some
of
its
glare
the
cathedral
disgorged
a
solemn
throng
escorting
three
huge
floats
that
began
a
circuit
of
the
broad
plaza
halting
before
every
building
of
importance
while
the
choir
sang
some
latin
anthem
before
the
virgin
and
her
two
accompanying
saints
all
flashing
with
rich
and
silks
marched
teams
of
beatas
with
ribbons
over
their
shoulders
feigning
to
supply
the
motive
power
which
was
in
reality
furnished
by
toiling
and
sweating
indians
beneath
the
massive
floats
as
the
head
of
the
procession
reached
certain
points
an
aged
indian
acolyte
set
off
fireworks
of
intricate
and
design
that
filled
the
air
as
with
a
sudden
bombardment
the
instant
these
fell
silent
swarms
of
boys
raced
into
the
smoke
from
every
side
to
fight
with
the
functionary
for
possession
of
the
charred
framework
every
male
as
well
as
the
indian
women
uncovered
as
the
figures
myself
too
busy
with
photography
to
honor
the
local
customs
yet
where
a
century
ago
such
sign
of
the
heretic
would
have
caused
homicidal
riot
i
heard
only
one
audible
some
one
of
the
newsboy
order
of
course
few
inhabitants
of
the
town
had
any
notion
of
its
history
back
of
their
own
lifetime
nor
any
real
interest
in
abetting
my
investigations
though
all
pretended
to
bubble
over
with
enthusiasm
for
them
a
blank
indifference
hangs
like
moss
over
the
records
of
the
past
throughout
all
the
andes
and
the
curious
traveler
will
find
more
by
wandering
around
until
he
stumbles
upon
them
than
by
making
inquiries
not
only
are
the
natives
ignorant
of
all
points
of
historical
interest
but
utterly
incapable
of
distinguishing
any
such
from
so
much
junk
it
is
just
as
useless
to
call
upon
the
representative
men
for
the
minds
of
these
differ
only
in
slight
degree
from
the
gente
del
pueblo
ayacucho
has
more
than
the
usual
excuse
for
this
ignorance
of
her
past
however
for
in
the
chilians
marched
into
the
region
took
possession
of
the
town
its
houses
goods
and
attractive
women
and
camping
in
the
city
hall
and
the
prefect
s
office
boiled
their
soup
over
the
archives
for
a
few
brief
months
before
their
arrival
ayacucho
was
the
proud
capital
of
peru
congress
held
its
sessions
in
the
old
church
of
san
augustín
cornering
on
the
plaza
and
for
a
while
money
was
coined
there
local
information
might
have
ended
with
that
but
for
the
fact
that
an
ayacuchano
who
eked
out
an
existence
santiago
knows
how
in
one
of
the
little
shops
under
the
portales
was
aficionado
to
the
history
of
the
region
i
spent
long
hours
with
him
for
clients
were
of
scant
importance
compared
to
his
hobby
he
was
unshakable
in
his
conviction
that
the
indian
was
just
as
ambitionless
and
in
his
habits
before
the
conquest
as
ayacucho
has
a
local
heroine
in
one
maría
parado
de
bellido
about
whom
already
strange
legends
have
gathered
a
chola
woman
of
the
who
could
neither
read
nor
write
she
took
a
leading
part
in
the
revolution
against
spanish
rule
having
undertaken
the
delivery
of
a
treasonable
letter
written
at
her
instigation
she
was
captured
by
the
spaniards
and
swallowing
the
missive
refused
to
betray
the
writer
for
which
hardheadedness
she
was
shot
before
the
broad
central
pillar
of
the
municipalidad
this
was
the
scene
of
many
an
execution
in
colonial
times
those
condemned
to
die
were
kept
three
days
in
the
arched
dungeon
that
forms
a
corner
of
the
building
gorged
with
all
spiritual
and
material
and
beefsteaks
and
the
like
as
my
informant
put
it
and
then
shot
he
asserted
that
in
ayacucho
none
were
burned
nor
otherwise
executed
by
the
inquisition
but
the
statement
has
not
all
the
earmarks
of
veracity
not
only
is
the
edifice
on
the
adjoining
corner
still
known
as
the
church
of
the
inquisition
but
a
city
whose
population
never
exceeded
that
could
build
the
large
churches
and
countless
chapels
still
existent
to
say
nothing
of
the
many
that
have
disappeared
just
because
the
priest
of
each
ward
cried
come
let
us
build
a
church
and
they
came
and
built
it
was
not
likely
to
be
contented
without
seeing
an
occasional
heretic
roasted
in
the
central
plaza
on
a
gala
sunday
afternoon
there
was
one
sight
which
the
authorities
were
so
bent
on
my
visiting
and
picturing
to
the
world
that
the
prefect
detailed
a
soldier
to
accompany
me
to
it
the
battle
of
ayacucho
really
took
place
at
la
quinua
on
the
sloping
brown
some
twelve
miles
to
the
northeast
of
the
city
from
any
high
place
in
town
the
village
backed
by
its
white
monument
and
the
dark
face
of
cundurcunca
the
condor
s
nest
is
plainly
visible
one
can
even
make
out
the
highway
on
which
the
spanish
veterans
zigzagged
up
to
the
deep
quebrada
in
which
la
serna
capitulated
almost
at
the
very
hour
that
phillip
v
in
spain
was
making
him
duke
of
the
andes
as
a
reward
for
his
victorious
campaign
there
was
no
cable
in
those
days
but
i
knew
no
way
of
telling
the
prefect
without
insult
that
i
did
not
choose
to
tramp
thirsty
miles
to
gaze
upon
a
plaster
monument
that
i
could
study
to
my
heart
s
content
from
where
i
sat
and
i
was
reduced
to
the
customary
strategy
of
intercourse
the
soldier
came
to
wake
me
at
is
the
south
american
way
to
fulfill
only
those
promises
one
hopes
will
be
forgotten
i
greeted
him
with
the
announcement
that
i
had
decided
to
put
off
the
trip
until
the
following
week
he
showed
distinct
signs
of
relief
at
not
having
to
drive
his
legs
with
heavy
unaccustomed
shoes
on
the
ends
of
them
all
day
and
as
everything
always
is
postponed
in
ayacucho
the
decision
caused
no
surprise
is
there
a
public
library
in
town
i
asked
a
native
son
cómo
no
he
cried
as
if
the
question
were
an
insult
to
the
culture
and
progress
for
which
ayacucho
fancies
itself
famed
following
his
directions
i
hurried
over
to
the
municipalidad
cheerful
with
the
prospect
of
spending
a
few
quiet
hours
among
its
books
for
some
time
i
wandered
through
several
patios
and
corredors
of
the
rambling
building
peering
into
many
a
room
with
uneven
earth
floor
without
finding
anything
even
mildly
resembling
a
library
at
length
i
stumbled
upon
a
chamber
marked
secretaría
in
which
six
men
of
varying
shades
of
color
were
discussing
the
coming
rolling
cigarettes
sleeping
and
otherwise
earning
their
salaries
a
long
search
brought
to
light
a
key
and
a
procession
of
the
full
municipal
force
of
ayacucho
escorted
me
through
several
more
empty
rooms
to
a
door
at
the
rear
of
the
building
you
see
explained
the
official
with
the
most
nearly
white
collar
and
the
longest
right
to
keep
his
hat
on
we
have
only
just
begun
to
form
the
library
so
the
catalogue
is
not
yet
available
nor
any
of
the
books
arranged
however
as
the
sign
over
the
door
announced
that
this
evidence
of
culture
and
progress
had
only
been
founded
in
it
was
natural
that
it
should
not
yet
be
set
in
order
one
can
not
expect
things
to
be
done
in
a
minute
in
latin
america
the
walls
of
the
mud
room
were
almost
hidden
by
books
however
nearly
all
of
them
bound
in
ancient
parchment
or
imitations
of
the
same
i
ran
my
eyes
along
them
the
six
municipal
employees
grouped
in
a
staring
semicircle
about
me
row
after
row
stretched
books
in
latin
italian
spanish
and
french
with
such
titles
as
the
infallibility
of
the
church
by
padre
the
life
of
saint
quién
sabe
by
a
brother
of
the
order
but
nowhere
was
there
one
with
a
suggestion
of
modern
utility
this
looks
much
like
a
priest
s
library
i
remarked
when
i
had
read
most
of
the
titles
cabalmente
señor
said
the
official
exactly
it
was
given
by
the
holy
bishop
who
died
a
few
years
ago
where
are
those
friars
who
were
arranging
the
books
he
demanded
querulously
glaring
at
his
inferiors
grouped
about
us
i
think
they
have
not
come
back
from
lunch
yet
tremulously
suggested
one
of
the
five
as
the
dust
lay
at
least
an
eighth
of
an
inch
thick
on
every
book
in
sight
the
good
friars
must
have
been
called
to
a
sumptuous
repast
indeed
isn
t
there
some
book
in
the
collection
that
will
give
me
something
of
interest
about
ayacucho
i
asked
as
to
no
indeed
here
you
have
the
five
volumes
of
bossuet
here
is
the
imitación
de
cristo
parchment
as
you
my
slightest
finger
movement
was
followed
by
six
pairs
of
eyes
as
closely
as
an
aficionado
of
the
watches
those
of
his
favorite
matador
had
i
found
anything
worth
reading
i
should
not
have
been
left
in
peace
to
read
it
first
because
of
the
excitement
which
the
sight
of
a
stranger
arouses
in
ayacucho
trebled
by
unbounded
wonder
that
any
man
should
be
interested
in
books
and
libraries
second
because
every
knows
that
any
person
left
alone
for
a
moment
in
a
library
is
sure
to
carry
off
as
many
books
as
he
can
conceal
about
his
person
the
most
modern
volumes
brought
to
light
by
a
more
careful
scrutiny
were
racine
s
works
and
a
spanish
edition
of
richardson
s
clarissa
harlowe
but
this
last
i
am
sure
some
practical
joker
had
given
the
good
bishop
so
late
in
life
that
he
had
not
found
time
to
read
and
destroy
it
before
he
was
called
to
whatever
reward
awaited
him
we
tiptoed
out
into
the
hallway
again
and
carefully
locked
up
the
dust
and
parchments
as
they
will
no
doubt
remain
until
the
worthy
friars
come
back
from
lunch
around
the
corner
the
cobbled
street
was
blocked
by
a
horseshoeing
contest
this
is
always
considered
a
very
serious
business
in
the
andes
though
the
average
horse
is
so
small
that
a
real
blacksmith
could
toss
him
about
at
will
a
barefoot
had
emerged
from
his
mud
dungeon
shop
containing
a
forge
from
vulcan
s
time
but
by
no
means
the
space
necessary
to
admit
the
animal
and
stood
watching
the
preparations
for
his
feat
with
the
anxious
and
critical
eye
of
an
aviator
about
to
attack
the
world
s
record
one
of
the
three
attendant
indians
threw
his
poncho
over
the
head
of
the
chusco
and
bound
its
eyes
then
a
rope
was
drawn
tightly
around
its
neck
with
a
choking
about
its
nose
an
indian
clinging
desperately
to
the
end
of
it
as
long
as
the
contest
lasted
next
a
lassoo
was
bound
to
the
animal
s
nigh
front
fetlock
and
the
foot
hoisted
by
another
attendant
on
the
off
side
who
used
the
back
of
the
brute
as
a
pulley
a
third
indian
held
the
foot
by
hand
when
all
was
ready
the
valorous
blacksmith
sneaked
up
and
pared
the
hoof
a
bit
with
an
instrument
much
like
a
small
sharp
shovel
with
a
long
it
very
imperfectly
as
is
the
way
of
andean
blacksmiths
leaving
so
much
of
the
toe
that
the
animal
was
in
constant
danger
of
having
an
ankle
broken
on
some
trail
then
he
hunted
up
a
cold
horseshoe
without
caulk
just
as
it
came
from
the
hardware
store
that
had
imported
it
from
the
united
the
andean
blacksmith
never
heats
a
shoe
much
less
alters
laid
it
gingerly
on
the
hoof
evidently
to
the
inexact
eye
of
the
herrero
it
fitted
he
clawed
around
among
the
cobbles
and
refuse
of
the
street
where
his
tools
lay
strewn
and
scattered
until
he
found
several
horseshoe
nails
of
the
style
in
vogue
in
our
own
land
before
the
civil
war
and
standing
afar
off
like
a
man
willing
to
risk
his
life
to
do
his
duty
yet
not
to
risk
it
beyond
reason
started
one
of
the
nails
with
a
hammer
suddenly
the
foot
twitched
the
blacksmith
sprang
backward
a
long
yard
with
blanched
countenance
the
fled
and
the
two
remaining
indians
cried
out
in
startled
quichua
while
clinging
to
the
far
ends
of
their
ropes
bit
by
bit
the
herrero
crept
up
again
and
took
to
driving
the
nails
at
long
range
as
if
he
were
mashing
the
head
of
a
venomous
snake
poised
on
his
toes
ready
to
spring
away
at
the
slightest
sign
of
life
in
the
blindfolded
animal
gradually
the
eight
nails
were
driven
not
without
several
repetitions
of
the
blanching
fright
and
the
operation
repeated
with
the
other
hoofs
finally
the
blacksmith
maneuvered
to
positions
in
which
he
could
twist
off
and
crudely
clinch
the
protruding
rubbed
a
rasp
once
or
twice
over
them
and
the
perilous
job
was
done
the
fiery
steed
was
relieved
of
the
blinding
poncho
the
indians
went
to
restore
their
nerves
with
a
of
pisco
and
the
blacksmith
collecting
fifteen
cents
a
shoe
from
the
owner
of
the
animal
shut
up
shop
forthwith
as
if
he
had
risked
his
life
enough
for
one
day
the
milking
of
a
cow
is
a
no
less
serious
business
in
the
andes
and
requires
as
large
a
force
first
the
cow
must
be
captured
and
confined
in
a
corral
overnight
calves
are
never
weaned
but
are
kept
away
from
the
mothers
until
the
hour
of
milking
as
each
cow
s
turn
comes
its
calf
is
freed
for
a
moment
then
dragged
away
by
main
force
and
either
tied
to
the
mother
s
front
leg
or
held
by
a
boy
close
enough
to
deceive
the
animal
into
fancying
she
is
feeding
her
own
offspring
another
youth
after
tying
her
hind
legs
together
at
the
ankles
clings
to
a
rope
about
her
neck
a
third
assistant
holds
a
or
shallow
under
the
udder
and
a
it
must
always
be
a
woman
i
know
not
but
the
fact
on
her
heels
at
arm
s
length
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
animal
and
falls
to
milking
with
much
the
same
attentive
regard
for
her
welfare
as
the
blacksmith
as
often
as
the
is
filled
the
milk
is
poured
into
a
vessel
outside
the
fence
or
one
in
the
hands
of
a
waiting
purchaser
the
woman
or
one
of
the
boys
laps
up
the
few
drops
left
in
the
socobe
and
the
task
continues
until
two
teats
are
stripped
the
two
remaining
belong
by
ancient
custom
to
the
calf
in
view
of
the
fact
that
cows
are
milked
at
most
once
a
day
and
often
at
irregular
or
broken
intervals
it
is
not
strange
that
milk
is
rare
and
butter
unknown
even
on
large
haciendas
well
stocked
with
cattle
saturday
is
beggar
s
day
in
ayacucho
as
in
most
towns
of
south
america
from
morning
till
night
a
constant
procession
of
disease
and
decrepitude
comes
whining
by
the
shops
so
endless
in
its
appeals
that
the
town
has
adopted
a
custom
similar
to
the
merchants
of
india
with
their
bowls
of
or
on
saturday
morning
each
shopkeeper
opens
a
package
of
large
needles
three
to
four
inches
long
one
of
which
he
bestows
upon
each
beggar
who
presents
himself
the
mendicant
mumbles
a
diós
pagarasunqui
and
shuffles
on
to
the
next
doorway
when
he
has
collected
ten
or
twelve
needles
if
he
be
so
lucky
he
sells
them
to
certain
dealers
for
a
cents
on
which
apparently
he
lives
until
the
next
saturday
in
some
parts
of
peru
the
indians
wear
a
large
needle
in
their
hatbands
evidently
as
a
weapon
of
defense
but
those
of
ayacucho
seem
to
have
no
practical
use
except
as
legal
tender
some
time
during
the
ensuing
week
the
purchasers
sell
them
back
to
the
shopkeepers
saturday
sees
them
again
distributed
and
so
they
go
on
indefinitely
around
the
circle
among
other
things
of
long
ago
ayacucho
used
to
have
a
university
her
highest
institution
of
learning
is
the
colegio
nacional
de
san
román
corresponding
to
our
high
in
the
impudence
of
its
pupils
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
supplying
this
institution
with
an
athletic
possession
it
seemed
in
this
a
benefit
was
perpetrated
on
the
sunday
of
my
stay
the
headed
by
currito
and
ramito
of
sevilla
my
at
the
hotel
were
the
same
modest
fellows
with
a
noisy
joy
in
life
that
i
had
found
most
of
their
fellows
in
spain
both
the
principals
had
come
over
with
posadas
one
of
the
friends
of
my
spanish
journey
who
had
returned
a
year
later
only
to
be
killed
by
a
miura
while
these
his
companions
remained
to
eke
out
a
livelihood
in
chile
peru
and
bolivia
all
the
gente
decente
of
ayacucho
and
their
wives
in
full
powder
were
on
hand
when
the
gala
corrida
began
we
of
the
élite
occupied
the
palcos
or
rows
of
chairs
shaded
by
a
faded
strip
of
canvas
up
on
the
roof
of
the
ancient
colegio
the
aged
red
tiles
of
which
were
trodden
to
powder
underfoot
the
ring
in
the
patio
below
fenced
by
poles
tied
to
uprights
and
other
rustic
makeshifts
was
surrounded
by
the
excited
gente
del
pueblo
the
scene
was
backed
by
a
massive
old
crumbling
would
have
been
hard
to
avoid
such
a
backing
in
a
view
of
most
of
the
town
sprinkled
away
through
its
valley
rasuillca
the
snowclad
and
the
black
range
of
cundurcunca
with
its
white
battle
monument
and
its
highway
zigzagging
away
over
into
the
great
amazonian
montaña
beyond
as
plainly
visible
as
if
they
stood
a
bare
mile
away
the
exciting
national
sport
of
spain
degenerates
at
best
to
a
dismal
pastime
in
the
new
world
the
imported
toreros
were
well
enough
but
the
bulls
of
the
andes
leave
much
to
be
desired
even
dogs
lose
their
aggressiveness
in
high
altitudes
it
is
said
at
any
rate
the
animals
gathered
for
the
occasion
on
the
broad
pampas
at
the
foot
of
cundurcunca
could
seldom
be
roused
to
face
the
toreros
and
spent
their
efforts
chiefly
in
racing
around
the
ring
in
vain
efforts
to
escape
until
they
were
at
length
tortured
out
of
existence
in
fact
about
all
the
gala
corrida
amounted
to
was
the
substitution
of
these
heroes
from
across
the
seas
for
the
native
butchers
accustomed
to
prepare
ayachucho
s
weekly
meat
supply
as
they
fell
the
animals
were
dragged
out
and
cut
up
within
full
sight
of
the
crowd
the
meat
in
some
cases
being
raffled
off
to
the
of
the
it
was
the
that
the
gathering
hooted
most
vociferously
picadores
and
horses
are
rarely
in
evidence
in
the
of
but
the
program
had
featured
the
promise
of
removing
the
carcasses
from
the
ring
al
estilo
de
españa
that
is
by
gaily
caparisoned
mules
it
was
this
new
evidence
of
culture
and
progress
that
much
of
ayacucho
had
come
to
see
but
when
the
first
victim
sprawled
in
the
dust
the
mules
were
missing
and
the
customary
gang
of
indians
crawled
through
the
barrier
and
tugging
at
its
tail
and
legs
and
raising
clouds
of
dust
that
their
activities
gradually
removed
the
fallen
brute
in
the
andean
manner
as
the
supply
of
meat
promised
to
exceed
the
demand
the
fifth
and
sixth
bulls
were
merely
decorated
with
banderillas
and
sent
back
to
the
corral
then
a
pair
of
were
turned
over
to
the
a
dozen
youths
of
the
best
families
descended
into
the
ring
in
their
most
impressive
sunday
garb
and
with
borrowed
from
the
toreros
and
demonstrated
their
own
skill
as
a
fulano
in
private
life
a
civil
engineer
at
least
on

have
come

the
most
striking
thing
in
ayacucho
of
its
women
in
the
andes
fashions
change
not
with
time
but
with
place
in
inca
days
each
district
had
its
own
distinctive
garb
or
at
least
a
custom
which
was
strictly
enforced
in
colonial
times
in
order
that
indians
belonging
to
one
province
might
not
escape
compulsory
labor
by
going
to
another
what
a
convenience
it
would
be
in
our
own
land
if
we
could
recognize
each
man
s
place
of
birth
by
the
shape
or
color
of
his
derby
the
bonnets
of
ayacucho
are
hard
to
believe
though
i
had
been
duly
warned
in
advance
the
first
glimpse
of
an
ayacuchana
caught
me
unawares
i
fancied
she
was
carrying
home
some
purchase
on
her
head
when
others
like
her
began
to
appear
from
all
directions
however
i
recalled
to
what
lengths
fair
woman
will
go
to
keep
in
fashion
the
wildest
nightmares
perpetrated
by
the
milliners
of
more
familiar
lands
by
no
means
come
so
perilously
near
reducing
the
mere
male
beholder
to
hysterics
as
this
which
at
first
sight
gives
a
suggestion
of
that
thrill
the
traveler
to
mars
might
experience
at
coming
suddenly
face
to
face
with
something
totally
new
and
unprecedented
the
rank
and
file
of
ayacucho
women
wear
on
their
heads
a
blanket
gay
in
hue
and
large
enough
to
serve
as
a
bedspread
nicely
folded
in
triangular
form
with
one
sharp
corner
protruding
over
the
face
each
one
is
distinct
in
color
with
an
embroidered
border
and
is
usually
lined
with
silk
even
the
women
from
the
suburbs
driving
to
market
donkeys
all
but
hidden
under
loads
of
burden
protected
from
its
hungry
carrier
by
a
large
wooden
gag
in
the
animal
s
this
contraption
on
their
heads
through
all
their
labors
no
one
in
ayacucho
could
tell
me
the
origin
of
so
absurd
a
fashion
though
all
were
agreed
it
had
been
in
vogue
a
very
long
time
nor
had
any
of
them
ever
developed
enough
curiosity
to
enquire
except
the
prefect
a
newcomer
in
this
region
who
had
investigated
in
vain
anchorena
the
piano
importer
had
promised
on
his
caballero
honor
to
have
chusquito
back
in
the
hotel
patio
on
sunday
night
that
i
might
continue
my
journey
at
dawn
knowing
only
too
well
the
nebulous
stuff
of
which
promises
are
made
i
set
out
on
saturday
to
jog
his
memory
the
houses
of
ayacucho
are
not
numbered
but
the
thumping
of
a
piano
in
the
throes
of
amateur
tuning
easily
guided
me
to
the
lawyer
s
dwelling
surrounded
by
the
gaudily
overdecorated
magnificence
of
his
parlor
he
laughed
at
my
absurd
misgivings
and
repeated
his
palabra
de
yet
when
night
fell
on
sunday
no
horse
had
appeared
i
hurried
back
to
the
anchorena
residence
the
lawyer
received
me
with
that
complacent
indifference
to
his
plighted
word
without
even
an
attempt
to
excuse
himself
which
is
common
to
his
race
as
in
the
days
of
the
conquest
when
betrayal
was
an
everyday
affair
the
word
of
the
most
important
resident
of
the
andes
is
not
worth
the
breath
required
to
utter
it
most
annoying
of
all
they
treat
any
protest
against
their
devotion
to
mañana
as
a
gringo
weakness
they
must
put
up
with
but
to
which
they
hope
never
to
fall
victims
themselves
even
as
they
listen
a
sneaking
smile
lurks
just
behind
their
solemn
countenances
as
if
they
were
hearing
the
plaints
of
a
querulous
child
were
we
in
this
world
merely
to
see
how
easily
we
could
drift
through
it
the
andean
point
of
view
would
be
superb
to
those
of
us
burdened
with
the
notion
that
we
are
here
to
get
some
little
thing
done
it
is
maddening
team
ess
eh
squeaked
the
lawyer
with
a
condescending
smirk
if
the
horse
does
not
arrive
perhaps
it
will
come
or
if
not
what
is
the
difference
whether
you
go
or
the
day
after
the
difference
my
friend
between
an
american
and
a
i
could
not
refrain
from
replying
and
may
it
ever
grow
thus
when
i
would
gladly
have
added
ayacucho
to
my
past
i
found
myself
helpless
to
advance
for
the
lawyer
would
not
even
direct
me
to
his
estate
that
i
might
bring
the
animal
myself
the
next
afternoon
an
indian
arrived
from
the
the
wrong
horse
i
joined
the
strolling
about
town
with
the
monday
languor
customary
to
their
profession
and
whiled
away
several
more
funereal
hours
then
at
dusk
i
returned
to
the
hotel
to
find
chusquito
lounging
against
a
pillar
in
front
of
my
door
looking
not
an
inch
rounder
for
all
the
very
rich
feed
with
which
the
hacienda
was
reputed
to
abound
the
way
he
fell
upon
a
bundle
of
alfalfa
bought
off
the
indian
woman
and
girl
who
sleep
on
the
of
santo
domingo
plaza
beside
a
heap
of
it
suggested
that
he
had
spent
the
week
grazing
on
bare
ground
yet
the
indian
who
brought
him
had
presented
an
exorbitant
bill
for
his
accommodation
from
the
of
the
man
who
had
implored
the
honor
of
giving
him
free
pasture
on
his
own
hacienda
i
was
awake
at
religious
by
the
time
the
birds
in
the
trees
began
to
twitter
we
had
left
the
acknowledged
cemetery
of
dead
man
s
corner
behind
and
were
climbing
away
toward
the
sunrise
the
road
true
to
its
environment
left
town
with
great
enthusiasm
but
soon
petered
out
to
a
wearisome
trail
of
several
villages
of
indians
noted
for
their
passive
resistance
to
all
the
demands
of
the
traveler
the
most
typical
was
ocros
we
came
out
far
above
it
one
morning
on
the
lofty
crest
of
a
range
from
which
the
trail
pitched
for
a
time
blindly
down
into
a
vast
sea
of
mist
hiding
all
the
unknown
world
before
us
bit
by
bit
vast
rocks
loomed
up
out
of
the
fog
like
black
misshapen
giants
then
huts
appeared
once
more
with
here
and
there
an
indian
plowing
a
bit
of
hillside
with
a
wooden
stick
and
a
pair
of
oxen
he
seemed
in
constant
peril
of
suddenly
losing
down
the
sheer
then
at
last
the
mist
cleared
and
disclosed
cramped
in
its
narrow
vale
far
below
among
dwarf
trees
a
town
which
rose
gradually
up
to
us
and
at
noon
after
all
but
losing
chusquito
and
my
other
worldly
belongings
through
a
bridge
that
showed
no
sign
of
having
been
condemned
until
we
were
upon
it
i
halted
at
the
hut
of
the
gobernador
he
was
probably
meant
that
he
was
hiding
in
one
of
the
ancient
mud
structures
that
surrounded
his
his
females
were
taciturn
i
displayed
my
government
order
and
asked
to
have
food
prepared
manam
cancha
mumbled
one
of
the
women
all
of
whom
kept
silently
and
impassively
at
work
with
their
primitive
spindles
i
must
have
fodder
for
the
animalito
i
protested
manam
cancha
came
the
monotonous
answer
again
with
that
inflection
peculiar
to
the
andean
indian
which
seems
to
say
there
isn
t
any
but
there
might
be
if
i
felt
like
going
to
get
i
should
have
preferred
hunger
to
a
scene
but
i
declined
to
allow
anyone
out
of
mere
apathy
to
starve
chusquito
manam
cancha
eh
i
cried
snatching
the
grass
roof
off
a
and
tossing
it
before
the
animal
sentimentalists
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding
the
surest
way
to
impress
an
andean
indian
is
to
appeal
to
force
gradually
the
most
democratic
traveler
learns
to
adopt
the
native
habit
of
addressing
him
as
tu
and
to
treat
him
like
the
balky
domestic
animal
he
so
closely
resembles
i
picked
up
a
boy
from
behind
the
mud
wall
surrounding
the
females
and
thrusting
a
coin
upon
him
ordered
him
to
go
and
buy
eggs
once
the
traveler
can
force
money
into
an
indian
s
possession
his
prospects
of
provisions
brighten
for
it
is
as
easy
for
the
latter
to
produce
them
as
to
come
and
return
the
coin
the
eggs
were
soon
forthcoming
and
taking
possession
of
a
table
under
the
projecting
roof
and
marching
into
the
kitchen
for
water
i
lighted
my
and
fell
to
preparing
a
meal
by
the
time
i
had
effectively
demonstrated
my
importance
the
same
woman
who
had
manam
me
in
the
beginning
came
to
say
that
if
i
would
give
her
a
medio
she
would
buy
fodder
and
a
few
moments
later
she
returned
carrying
in
her
own
arms
a
huge
bundle
of
or
dry
cornstalks
over
which
chusquito
struggled
during
the
rest
of
our
stay
in
competition
with
the
family
calf
pigs
and
chickens
it
was
probably
as
much
out
of
a
desire
to
inspect
my
cooking
outfit
as
fear
for
her
that
had
won
me
attendance
behind
the
mask
that
hides
his
emotions
the
indian
of
the
andes
is
filled
with
curiosity
there
runs
an
andean
anecdote
that
well
illustrates
this
characteristic
one
of
their
own
race
who
had
served
in
the
army
and
learned
other
things
without
forgetting
the
ways
of
his
own
people
came
at
night
to
an
indian
hut
and
requested
lodging
when
this
was
granted
in
the
customary
by
not
being
asked
for
food
manam
cancha
came
the
expected
reply
well
sell
me
something
and
i
will
cook
for
manam
the
soldier
was
well
aware
that
there
were
plenty
of
supplies
hidden
away
in
the
hut
he
knew
also
the
indian
temperament
well
i
suppose
i
ll
have
to
get
along
on
a
chupe
de
guijarros
he
sighed
using
spanish
to
make
his
speech
more
impressive
a
stone
soup
murmured
the
household
betrayed
by
astonishment
into
understanding
a
tongue
they
pretended
not
to
know
yes
it
is
what
we
use
in
the
army
when
there
is
nothing
he
wandered
down
to
the
mountain
stream
below
the
hut
and
returning
with
a
dozen
large
smooth
pebbles
washed
them
carefully
and
laid
them
out
on
his
bundle
you
won
t
mind
lending
me
an
olla
he
murmured
to
the
wall
of
expressionless
faces
about
him
a
woman
brought
the
kettle
in
silence
the
soldier
humming
a
ballad
the
pot
with
water
set
it
over
the
fire
dropped
in
the
stones
one
by
one
and
squatted
on
his
heels
with
a
sigh
of
contentment
by
and
by
he
borrowed
a
wooden
spoon
and
tasted
the
concoction
from
time
to
time
throwing
the
residue
back
into
the
kettle
in
approved
andean
fashion
you
don
t
happen
to
have
a
bit
of
salt
he
murmured
after
a
time
to
the
family
now
gathered
close
around
him
watching
this
possible
miracle
silently
but
intently
cachi
that
we
have
said
the
woman
handing
him
a
piece
of
purple
rock
which
he
beat
up
and
sprinkled
into
the
now
steaming
pot
too
bad
i
haven
t
a
few
potatoes
to
put
in
he
droned
as
if
to
himself
it
would
help
the
the
old
woman
shambled
away
into
the
darkness
of
a
far
corner
and
came
back
some
time
later
to
thrust
silently
toward
him
a
handful
of
small
potatoes
her
eyes
glued
on
the
miraculous
pot
when
these
were
about
the
soldier
again
broke
off
his
song
to
murmur
this
is
going
to
be
one
of
the
finest
chupes
de
guijarros
i
ve
ever
made
all
it
lacks
now
is
a
bit
of
ají
to
give
it
the
old
woman
muttered
something
to
one
of
the
ragged
girls
beside
her
and
the
latter
went
to
dig
two
red
peppers
out
of
the
thatch
a
piece
of
cabbage
would
make
it
perfect
sighed
the
soldier
the
indians
too
engrossed
in
the
production
of
a
stone
soup
and
too
slow
of
mind
to
have
caught
up
yet
with
the
course
of
events
brought
to
light
a
small
cabbage
by
this
time
they
were
so
consumed
with
curiosity
that
the
old
man
asked
innocently
but
do
you
make
a
stone
soup
without
meat
ah
to
be
sure
a
strip
of
charqui
always
improves
it
replied
the
soldier
indifferently
but
a
girl
was
sent
to
fetch
a
sheet
of
beef
which
the
former
conscript
cut
up
slowly
and
dropped
bit
by
bit
into
the
now
chupe
a
later
he
lifted
the
kettle
off
the
fire
the
old
woman
handed
him
a
gourd
plate
and
some
cold
boiled
yuca
as
bread
and
having
given
half
of
it
to
the
family
he
ate
the
stone
soup
with
great
except
the
dozen
smooth
round
stones
at
the
bottom
of
the
olla
all
that
afternoon
we
slipped
and
slid
down
a
that
bruised
my
toes
if
not
chusquito
s
into
a
repulsive
and
desert
in
which
a
tropical
sun
blazed
with
homicidal
intensity
no
wonder
its
blistering
rays
faded
the
cloth
of
my
breeches
when
it
bleached
even
chusquito
s
coat
to
a
pale
reddish
yellow
had
i
not
come
upon
an
isolated
hut
and
a
gourdful
of
chicha
de
jora
just
when
i
did
it
is
by
no
means
certain
that
i
should
not
have
perished
of
thirst
before
the
day
was
done
the
hacienda
pajo
nal
in
the
valley
of
the
pampas
river
where
sunset
overtook
us
was
in
charge
of
a
white
and
cultured
woman
engaged
in
the
inviting
occupation
of
dealing
out
to
indians
the
concentrated
juice
of
a
large
hogshead
in
the
liquor
room
the
husband
who
loomed
up
through
the
tropical
twilight
was
the
graduate
of
an
american
agricultural
college
but
the
hacienda
under
charge
of
his
mayordomo
was
farmed
in
the
same
backward
manner
as
in
the
times
of
the
incas
without
even
their
energy
and
his
foreign
training
had
given
him
no
inkling
of
the
proper
occupation
for
wives
nor
did
he
give
any
evidence
of
ability
to
speak
english
after
the
patriarchial
supper
around
a
long
table
he
set
in
motion
a
large
phonograph
and
we
heard
not
only
the
best
opera
stars
of
the
day
but
such
exotic
selections
as
the
old
gray
bonnet
and
a
tale
of
love
and
moonlight
along
the
wabash
a
veritable
crowd
of
arrieros
and
native
travelers
who
had
made
this
their
night
s
stopping
place
and
the
uncouth
indian
laborers
of
the
hacienda
gathered
on
the
edge
of
the
darkness
and
stood
like
statues
as
long
as
the
entertainment
lasted
evidently
they
were
amused
or
they
would
not
have
remained
but
the
absolute
stoniness
of
their
expression
without
the
faintest
outward
evidence
of
pleasure
would
have
brought
dismay
to
a
living
entertainer
we
had
dropped
again
into
a
genuine
warm
as
the
cauca
valley
where
tiny
gnats
decorated
my
skin
with
an
annoyance
that
was
to
last
for
days
to
come
and
though
i
was
favored
with
the
all
important
peruvian
haciendas
provide
for
travelers
the
corredor
outside
my
door
and
all
the
neighboring
patios
and
corrals
was
strewn
with
indians
of
both
sexes
stretched
out
among
their
bales
and
trappings
an
hour
or
more
next
morning
along
the
flat
planted
with
brought
us
to
one
of
those
swaying
bridges
over
a
roaring
stream
compressed
between
precipitous
so
numerous
in
the
time
of
the
incas
but
instead
of
woven
willow
withes
it
was
supported
by
cables
and
as
if
to
recall
the
provident
incas
by
contrast
was
sadly
in
need
of
the
repair
that
had
just
begun
chusquito
crossed
the
precarious
contraption
only
under
protest
after
the

should
have

up
at

days
until
the
languid
workmen
finished
their
task
we
were
now
in
the
department
of
apurímac
some
miles
further
along
the
river
through
a
sandy
wilderness
of
noisy
with
flocks
of
screaming
green
parrots
the
trail
struck
upward
on
the
famous
ascent
of
bombón
it
was
another
of
those
infernally
stony
endless
blazing
absolutely
waterless
climbs
that
must
be
endured
wherever
a
river
has
cut
its
way
deep
into
the
andes
requiring
a
day
of
laborious
toil
to
advance
a
few
miles
across
a
chasm
that
might
almost
be
bridged
even
chusquito
seemed
ready
to
stretch
out
on
his
back
when
at
last
we
reached
the
summit
the
lofty
plateau
again
spreading
away
cool
and
inviting
before
us
in
chincheros
the
gobernador
attempted
at
first
to
deny
the
honor
but
being
caught
in
the
act
as
it
were
accepted
the
situation
with
good
grace
as
became
a
caballero
of
considerable
spanish
ancestry
in
the
black
shale
of
his
back
corredor
all
the
local
authorities
were
gathered
about
a
long
table
that
groaned
as
with
the
gout
each
time
any
of
its
legs
was
subjected
to
undue
weight
their
state
papers
seals
and
and
a
goodly
array
of
large
bottles
spread
out
before
them
when
he
had
spelled
out
my
papers
the
gobernador
invited
me
to
make
the
veranda
my
home
as
long
as
i
chose
to
grace
chincheros
with
my
countenance
and
i
spent
what
remained
of
the
day
amid
a
mixture
of
chicha
pisco
and
justice
a
fully
sober
person
was
not
to
be
expected
at
that
hour
in
peru
but
the
authorities
were
still
sufficiently
aware
of
the
dignity
of
their
position
to
whisk
the
bottles
out
of
sight
when
i
prepared
to
photograph
the
group
that
an
andarín
should
not
present
a
book
for
their
seals
and
signatures
they
took
as
a
slight
and
i
was
forced
to
submit
several
pages
of
my
to
their
official
decoration
during
all
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
indians
and
came
slinking
in
before
the
authoritative
crowd
one
of
whom
was
a
notary
public
to
mumble
their
petitions
or
complaints
with
many
a
cringing
and
the
air
of
slaves
before
masters
the
otherwise
subservient
proceedings
were
broken
once
by
a
wordy
between
the
gobernador
and
an
aged
caballero
dressed
in
rags
and
pride
who
bade
a
formal
farewell
to
the
women
of
the
family
and
other
officials
but
left
without
the
customary
handshake
with
the
gobernador
marking
this
as
the
most
serious
quarrel
i
had
yet
witnessed
in
south
america
when
the
business
of
the
day
was
over
the
authorities
all
joined
in
a
game
of
quoits
with
silver
soles
in
place
of
horseshoes
to
determine
which
of
them
should
supply
the
wine
that
topped
off
the
festivities
the
family
supper
was
served
on
the
table
so
recently
occupied
by
the
affairs
of
justice
and
i
spread
my
bed
on
two
of
the
benches
that
had
sustained
the
weight
of
the
august
judges
here
and
there
on
the
mud
floor
of
the
an
indian
slept
curled
up
like
a
contented
yellow
dog
on
a
bundle
of
rags
or
i
had
assigned
to
the
long
hard
day
across
the
great
range
beyond
chincheros
the
experience
of
chewing
coca
said
to
sustain
the
andean
indian
on
his
laborious
journeyings
as
we
undulated
across
the
barren
brown
top
of
the
world
i
began
feeding
myself
leaf
by
leaf
adhering
strictly
to
the
accepted
rules
of
this
indigenous
sport
until
i
had
formed
a
bulging
cud
in
my
right
left
is
also
permitted
by
the
rules
the
taste
was
not
unlike
that
of
dry
hay
then
i
bit
off
several
nibbles
of
lime
from
the
burnt
stone
i
had
bought
in
the
market
of
huancayo
and
mixing
it
with
the
leaves
began
to
chew
the
only
sensation
i
was
clearly
aware
of
was
that
the
lime
burned
my
gums
atrociously
as
it
would
have
done
had
the
coca
leaf
never
been
discovered
i
am
not
sure
that
i
did
not
feel
a
slight
increase
in
exhilaration
that
caused
me
to
lift
my
feet
a
trifle
faster
but
this
may
easily
have
been
due
to
the
beauty
of
the
scene
that
stretched
to
infinity
on
every
hand
for
even
chusquito
seemed
inspired
to
bestir
his
dainty
hoofs
with
more
than
his
accustomed
sprightliness
the
hazy
valley
of
the
pampas
river
with
its
biting
gnats
had
disappeared
into
the
past
and
only
the
bare
brown
world
spread
before
us
to
a
far
distant
horizon
that
seemed
to
move
forward
as
we
advanced
small
wonder
the
natives
were
astonished
that
i
kept
the
road
i
could
not
but
be
surprised
myself
that
instinct
and
the
slight
assistance
of
my
guided
me
aright
across
this
unpeopled
where
the
traveler
must
constantly
watch
the
faintly
marked
path
lest
it
take
advantage
of
the
briefest
inattention
to
dodge
from
under
his
feet
and
leave
him
hopelessly
stranded
high
up
on
a
dreary
puna
trackless
as
the
sea
itself
on
these
shelterless
heights
it
was
easy
to
understand
why
each
succeeding
town
had
watched
my
departure
with
gaping
mouths
and
that
the
boldest
inhabitants
had
cried
out

the

began
to

at
last
and
we
came
out
far
above
a
long
winding
valley
in
the
dim
end
of
which
i
could
make
out
a
green
speck
that
was

only
the
disordered
imagination
seemed
capable

creating
we
began
to
go
down
and
forever
down
so
swiftly
that
we
could
have
kicked
each
other
in
our
disgust

slipping
and
stumbling
along
toboggans
of
loose
stones

picking
our
way

natural

descending

steep
meadows

with
his

gave
a
ludicrous

some
silly
fellow
attempting
to
skate

slope
moderated
its
pace
and
took
on
a

garb

and

on
which
we
had
been
walking
a
bare
two
hours
before
now
towering
into
the
sky

the
village
of
moyabamba
so
renowned
for
its
that
we
lost
no
time
in
leaving
it
behind
us
the
valley
narrowed
to
a
gorge
in
which
our
progress
was
blocked
by
a
of
ica

fell
in
with

at
the
rear

richter
addressee

kept
a
little
on
a
corner
of
the
plaza

and
i
waited
in
the
streak
of
shade
before
his
shop
until
he
had
spelled
out
the
missive
with
teutonic
deliberation
in
marked
contrast
to
the
quickness
of
welcome
which
almost
as
quickly
explodes
into
thin
air
our
new
host
had
first
emigrated
forty
years
before
from
poland
to
new
york
where
he
had
lived
several
months
in
schtreet
a
fact
he
never
lost
an
opportunity
to
mention
evidently
under
the
impression
that
it
was
still
the
aristocratic
center
of
the
city
during
that
time
he
had
worked
in
a
store
way
uptown
in
oonion
he
still
boasted
a
brother
in
the
kosher
district
of
harlem
but
for
some
reason
that
does
not
apply
to
most
of
his
race
he
had
drifted
on
to
peru
and
become
a
true
peruvian
even
to
taking
off
his
hat
when
a
tin
virgin
passed
in
the
street
yet
we
spoke
german
together
he
seemed
to
prefer
it
to
spanish
even
after
half
a
lifetime
in
the
andes
and
despite
a
peruvian
wife
and
half
a
dozen
children
entirely
ignorant
of
the
former
tongue
the
richter
meals
were
more
than
substantial
and
his
family
bubbled
over
with
but
he
was
forced
to
share
the
honor
of
a
guest
from
américa
del
norte
with
one
da
pozzo
who
dwelt
in
solitary
state
in
an
ancient
ruin
on
a
knoll
across
the
prattling
chumbau
he
was
a
venetian
on
the
sadder
side
of
forty
once
an
architect
of
high
standing
who
had
laid
out
more
than
one
plaza
de
armas
in
peru
and
bolivia
several
turns
of
the
wheel
of
fate
in
the
wrong
direction
among
them
a
peruvian
wife
the
confessional
and
the
fiery
waters
that
partly
drown
such
memories
had
reduced
his
ambition
to
a
low
level
and
his
income
to
what
may
be
picked
up
by
the
building
of
mud
houses
in
these
drowsy
towns
of
the
interior
in
his
customary
condition
he
was
maudlinly
affectionate
to
the
point
of
making
even
my
cheeks
the
target
of
his
bewhiskered
kisses
and
vociferous
in
his
assertion
that
he
was
a
masón
and
a
hater
of
priests
in
all
lands
and
languages
but
what
mattered
all
this
or
the
fact
that
his
ruin
boasted
only
one
bed
and
that
the
rotting
old
balcony
seemed
always
on
the
point
of
dropping
from
under
one
for
it
overlooked
splendid
groves
and
rows
of
the
slender
eucalyptus
where
birds
sang
merrily
as
well
as
the
brown
flanks
of
the
andes
rolling
up
out
of
both
sides
and
ends
of
a
valley
enlivened
by
a
constant
going
and
coming
of
indians
along
its
broad
roadway
then
too
there
was
rich
alfalfa
on
which
chusquito
might
gorge
himself
at
no
other
expense
than
an
occasional
medio
to
the
indian
boy
assigned
the
task
of
cutting
that
he
have
affection
for
you
and
your
andahuaylas
is
really
nothing
but
an
example
of
how
life
may
be
made
a
perennial
pastime
scattered
almost
thickly
along
the
entire
two
leagues
from
talavera
to
san
jerónimo
yet
its
situation
and
climate
give
it
a
charm
peculiarly
its
own
and
it
would
be
hard
to
imagine
a
better
place
in
which
to
drift
through
its
inhabitants
seem
to
recognize
though
the
long
valley
is
extremely
fertile
it
produces
little
the
indians
of
more
or
less
full
blood
that
make
up
the
bulk
of
the
population
will
not
work
the
white
man
can
not
lest
he
forever
lose
his
precious
caste
the
laziest
american
laborer
known
to
charity
bureaus
will
do
more
and
better
work
in
an
hour
unwatched
than
the
liveliest
indian
of
andahuaylas
in
a
day
with
a
boss
standing
over
him
without
in
the
least
hurrying
i
could
descend
from
the
upper
story
of
our
ruin
to
the
river
return
with
a
pail
of
water
complete
my
toilet
and
throw
out
the
water
before
the
indian
boy
whose
only
duty
in
life
was
to
attend
me
would
if
called
appear
from
his
seat
directly
below
my
balcony
to
get
the
he
would
smash
before
he
got
back
if
there
was
any
possible
way
of
doing
so
and
into
which
he
would
certainly
manage
to
get
some
sort
of
filth
if
he
had
to
pick
it
up
and
throw
it
in
the
lay
the
blame
of
this
condition
on
the
the
free
complaining
that
there
is
no
longer
service
for
as
soon
as
the
cholo
has
been
to
school
he
wants
to
be
a
faltan
are
lacking
they
wail
gazing
across
the
all
but
uncultivated
valley
yet
not
one
of
them
notices
the
two
hanging
idly
at
his
own
sides
a
shower
of
medios
failed
to
win
from
the
indian
boy
an
affection
sufficient
to
keep
chusquito
from
starvation
i
obtained
permission
to
tie
the
animal
in
a
corner
of
the
fat
alfalfa
field
that
would
not
come
to
him
and
all
day
long
i
could
see
him
across
the
little
river
a
contented
dot
of
red
against
the
deep
green
background
of
the
field
from
which
he
never
raised
his
head
the
whole
day
through
yet
the
products
of
the
valley
are
cheap
enough
when
they
exist
eggs
were
five
cents
a
dozen
one
morning
an
indian
who
needed
the
money
came
to
the
ruin
to
offer
me
eight
for
a
medio
cents
four
liters
of
milk
might
be
had
for
cents
but
let
the
harassed
american
householder
pause
a
moment
and
reflect
before
he
sells
his
chattels
and
hurries
down
to
andahuaylas
to
obtain
those
four
liters
one
must
take
a
pail
and
wander
several
miles
along
the
valley
at
about
nine
in
the
morning
wait
around
some
hacienda
corral
where
the
indians
have
concluded
not
to
abandon
the
daily
milking
and
never
get
home
before
noon
the
best
families
have
a
special
who
does
nothing
frequently
not
even
go
milk
hunting
and
on
an
average
he
is
robbed
on
his
way
home
of
the
contents
of
his
pail
about
every
third
morning
by
some
group
of
indians
who
come
upon
him
out
of
sight
of
any
member
of
the
gente
class
there
is
a
type
of
white
indian
in
the
andahuaylas
valley
apparently
without
admixture
of
european
blood
yet
with
a
very
light
skin
and
delicate
pink
cheeks
in
the
color
of
their
garments
they
nearly
rival
those
of
quito
the
heavy
woolen
socks
and
hairy
sandals
of
more
lofty
regions
are
unknown
and
the
barefoot
patter
again
reigns
supreme
in
manner
the
aboriginal
is
cringing
and
timorous
yet
if
the
word
of
the
shod
minority
was
trustworthy
he
has
more
than
once
been
known
to
sneak
up
on
a
sleeping
gringo
and
mash
his
head
with
a
rock
nor
will
he
squeal
on
one
of
his
own
race
even
when
put
to
the
torture
in
the
wilderness
of
weeds
that
passed
for
the
local
cemetery
i
came
upon

might
have
thrown
away

first

tied
ropes
by
which
a

of
equally
muscular

ten
minutes

so
nearly

the
chief
among
many
absurdities
testifying
to
the
local
absence
of
a
sense
of
humor
were
the
figures
in
the
main
these
were
statues
of
christ
and
the
virgin
the
former
in
a
sort
of
precieux
gown
and
a
red
hat
with
a
pink
band
the
latter
in
a
still
broader
blue
one
giving
the
pair
a
ludicrous
resemblance
to
the
shepherds
into
which
the
nobles
of
the
french
court
of
two
centuries
ago
used
to
disguise
themselves
an
impression
increased
by
the
cross
between
a
and
a
hook
carried
by
the
cristo
yet
the
simple
indians
pattered
in
all
through
the
day
to
kneel
and
gaze
with
a
beatified
expression
in
which
there
was
not
the
shadow
of
a
smile
at
these
absurd
figures
no
doubt
considering
them
the
last
word
in
beauty
when
all
is
said
and
done
there
is
a
subtle
lazy
charm
about
the
valley
of
andahuaylas
that
holds
the
traveler
long
after
he
should
have
moved
on
sometimes
as
the
placid
days
drifted
smoothly
by
one
caught
the
native
point
of
view
and
regretted
the
intrusion
of
strenuous
gringo
activity
in
the
midst
of
nature
s
and
man
s
repose
a
realization
that
we
of
the
north
do
much
which
is
not
much
even
when
we
get
it
done
here
one
could
lie
in
perfect
contentment
and
watch
the
road
looping
away
out
of
the
valley
over
a
sunlit
hill
without
feeling
too
strong
for
resistance
the
itch
to
be
off
yet
in
the
end
the
only
sure
means
of
enjoying
an
andean
range
is
to
know
that
some
day
one
is
going
to
tramp
away
into
it
to
follow
the
trail
that
shoulders
its
way
mysteriously
off
through
those
shaded
valleys
and
rugged
quebradas
beckoning
one
toward
another
and
a
new
world

chapter
xvi
the
city
of
the
sun
i
grew
suddenly
tired
of
andahuaylas
one
afternoon
and
sunrise
next
morning
found
me
driving
chusquito
over
the
neighboring
divide
we
had
turned
aside
from
the
direct
route
to
abancay
following
the
valley
of
the
chumbau
for
the
least
we
could
do
for
our
recent
hosts
was
to
carry
their
greetings
to
an
isolated
his
civilized
hacienda
sloped
up
from
the
shore
of
a
beautiful
mountain
lake
some
twenty
miles
in
circumference
as
some
immense
emerald
with
rising
all
about
it
and
a
village
tucked
away
in
one
corner
but
as
so
often
in
the
high
andes
its
entire
shore
was
bordered
with
slime
and
reeds
that
made
access
almost
impossible
mine
host
shouldered
his
and
easily
provided
a
brace
of
ducks
for
the
evening
meal
but
he
refused
vociferously
to
swim
and
watched
my
preparations
with
patent
misgiving
i
succeeded
in
finding
an
entrance
and
took
a
header
into
the
seemingly
bottomless
immensity
of
icy
water
to
the
vast
astonishment
of
all
the
indian
shepherds
male
and
female
who
live
out
their
lives
among
their
flocks
on
the
edge
of
this
magnificent
body
of
water
without
ever
washing
a
foot
in
it
to
say
nothing
of
contriving
a
boat
the
lake
is
said
to
be
famous
for
its
floating
islands
that
blow
back
and
forth
across
it
with
cattle
grazing
serenely
upon
them
but
it
was
my
luck
to
find
even
this
andean
invention
out
of
order
and
no
longer
my
host
was
of
rare
adaptability
for
a
and
of
no
slight
mechanical
ability
he
not
only
had
a
real
but
his
wheat
before
grinding
it
this
removes
him
at
once
and
forever
from
the
spig
class
his
own
electric
plant
furnished
the
most
satisfactory
light
i
had
read
by
since
leaving
lima
a
telephone
connected
him
with
the
outside
this
contrivance
was
not
yet
considered
a
fitting
messenger
for
the
greetings
of
his
compadres
in
andahuaylas
with
the
advertisement
of
a
singola
as
a
model
he
had
fitted
his
small
phonograph
into
a
cedar
box
making
it
an
instrument
quite
equal
both
in
tone
and
appearance
to
that
in
the
catalogue
only
he
who
knows
how
devoid
of
mechanical
ability
is
the
average
can
realize
how
vastly
this
feat
lifted
the
hacendado
above
his
fellows
i
had
the
lake
and
crossed
a
stony
range
next
day
when
near
noon
in
a
collection
of
huts
called
pincos
at
the
bottom
of
a
mighty
quebrada
i
caught
sight
of
something
i
had
never
before
seen
in
south
america
it
was
a
white
boy
perhaps
twelve
years
old
wearing
shoes
yet
in
spite
of
that
carrying
a
bundle
over
one
shoulder
like
one
bound
on
a
journey
going
somewhere
i
asked
al
cuzco
was
the
astonishing
reply
a
peruvian
boy
actually
leaving
home
to
go
somewhere
else
just
like
a
live
american
then
we
d
better
go
together
i
answered
as
soon
as
i
had
recovered
my
breath
the
child
rose
without
a
word
and
turned
his
face
with
me
toward
the
trail
looping
upward
across
the
chasm
what
s
your
name
i
began
lamely
as
we
strained
along
at
the
heels
of
chusquito
who
had
seemed
little
less
surprised
than
i
at
this
extraordinary
apparition
teófilo
fulano
replied
our
new
companion
fulano
relative
perhaps
of
the
señor
fulano
at
whose
hacienda
i
spent
last
night
yes
don
faustino
is
my
impossible
i
cried
he
is
only
recently
married
and
has
no
not
since
he
is
married
replied
the
child
innocently
and
he
won
t
recognize
and
your
mother
i
continued
after
a
time
she
keeps
a
in
andahuaylas
answered
the
boy
she
used
to
love
don
for
hours
we
rose
steadily
the
valley
of
pincos
and
the
little
river
frothing
over
the
stones
at
its
bottom
sinking
lower
and
lower
beneath
us
a
damp
coolness
tempering
our
toil
and
somewhat
offsetting
the
absence
of
drinkingwater
our
shadows
crawled
from
under
our
feet
and
grew
to
erectness
before
us
and
still
the
rather
roadway
looped
upward
why
do
you
go
to
cuzco
i
asked
breaking
in
upon
the
story
of
some
boyish
prank
for
once
i
had
won
his
confidence
the
child
was
garrulous
after
the
manner
of
his
race
one
of
my
relatives
lives
there
he
muttered
the
answer
was
too
exactly
in
the
tone
of
the
same
reply
in
another
tongue
i
had
so
often
heard
from
the
lips
of
hoboing
youngsters
in
my
own
land
to
be
taken
for
more
than
a
subterfuge
i
hold
it
any
man
s
privilege
to
keep
his
own
counsel
however
even
though
he
has
not
yet
reached
the
mark
and
he
was
soon
prattling
on
again
as
unbrokenly
as
if
the
steep
slopes
of
his
native
mountains
were
level
plain
a
crude
cross
surrounded
by
an
irregular
heap
of
stones
tossed
there
one
by
one
by
passing
indians
marked
the
summit
on
the
bit
of
pampa
that
preceded
another
stony
descent
stood
the
ruin
of
what
may
have
been
an
inca
fortress
or
lookout
with
another
crazy
cross
atop
from
it
spread
a
vast
view
with
the
morrow
s
road
plainly
in
sight
squirming
out
of
a
valley
and
panting
away
over
another
of
the
countless
andean
ridges
that
divide
this
region
as
with
a
series
of
mighty
walls
but
it
was
long
afterward
that
we
came
in
sight
of
huancarama
wedged
in
the
throat
of
the
gorge
and
extremely
inviting
at
a
distance
to
three
famished
and
choking
roadsters
our
reception
there
was
so
typical
that
i
am
minded
to
describe
it
for
all
its
similarity
to
other
experiences
we
had
explored
the
place
rather
thoroughly
before
we
located
the
dwelling
of
ezequiel
palomino
the
gobernador
it
is
a
common
ruse
of
the
rural
authorities
of
peru
not
only
to
hide
from
an
arriving
stranger
but
to
swear
the
rest
of
the
town
to
secrecy
small
wonder
since
they
hold
their
positions
on
compulsion
and
without
emoluments
moreover
their
inability
to
visualize
that
which
is
absent
gives
these
isolated
rural
officials
a
contempt
for
the
government
and
its
orders
unless
it
is
actually
there
in
person
and
well
armed
the
doors
of
don
ezequiel
s
shop
facing
the
plaza
were
closed
and
his
indian
women
in
the
patio
as
stupid
in
their
indifference
and
as
clumsy
as
usual
at
covering
up
their
lies
the
set
answer
to
any
inquiry
for
the
head
of
such
a
household
is
a
mumbled
no
stá
cá
or
its
quichua
equivalent
yet
if
one
answer
i
did
not
ask
where
he
was
you
daughter
of
a
father
without
understanding
i
asked
is
he
one
is
considered
rude
and
unsimpático
a
long
struggle
brought
only
the
information
that
the
gobernador
was
in
some
indefinite
place
somewhere
or
near
at
hand
and
that
he
might
or
might
not
return
in
the
natural
course
of
events
but
this
time
there
was
a
loophole
in
the
defenses
of
the
besieged
a
it
as
well
as
all
its
accumulated
stock
seemed
to
be
the
extent
of
his
the
plaza
turned
out
to
be
the
alcalde
who
evidently
was
privately
disgruntled
with
his
for
when
my
questions
grew
pressing
he
swore
me
to
secrecy
and
whispered
the
gobernador
is
at
home
asleep
in
his
own
house
because
he
is
seasick
and
he
winked
ever
so
faintly
at
the
generous
display
of
bottles
on
the
shelves
beside
us
far
be
it
from
me
to
blame
any
man
for
whiling
away
an
andean
existence
in
the
only
available
fashion
but
poor
uncomplaining
chusquito
had
already
stood
a
long
hour
unfed
and
unwatered
his
burden
still
upon
him
and
steep
and
stony
miles
in
his
slender
legs
i
lost
no
time
in
returning
to
the
patio
the
indian
women
seeing
no
way
out
of
it
admitted
that
their
lord
and
master
was
sick
in
bed
but
ya
no
más
ha
de
venir
may
mean
he
is
coming
at
once
or
that
he
may
come
the
day
after
i
strode
up
the
outside
stairs
to
the
veranda
and
throwing
open
the
several
doors
discovered
at
last
the
elusive
official
a
of
the
most
disgusting
type
i
slapped
him
in
the
face
figuratively
at
least
with
my
government
order
and
with
a
savage
leer
and
an
unhuman
growl
he
ordered
a
servant
to
open
for
us
a
mud
den
facing
the
street
as
to
alfalfa
that
he
mumbled
was
far
i
thrust
a
coin
upon
him
piled
our
junk
in
the
bare
dungeon
with
the
little
fatherless
one
to
watch
over
it
and
set
out
to
forage
food
for
ourselves
when
i
returned
the
gobernador
had
carried
out
the
legal
requirements
of
his
office
by
causing
an
indian
to
toss
before
chusquito
a
small
handful
of
last
year
s
this
time
he
had
hidden
himself
effectually
i
began
a
systematic
search
of
the
premises
in
a
behind
the
patio
wall
i
found
a
of
the
gobernador
s
fat
horses
stuffing
themselves
to
bursting
from
an
enormous
heap
of
fresh
green
alfalfa
the
indian
whom
i
caught
by
the
slack
of
the
garment
and
drove
before
me
under
all
the
load
he
could
carry
pocketed
a
with
a
promise
to
watch
over
the
fodder
and
to
repeat
the
dose
at
dawn
but
i
also
hovered
for
some
time
in
the
shadow
near
at
hand
in
the
hope
of
catching
some
one
attempting
to
snatch
away
chusquito
s
meal
that
i
might
fittingly
express
my
feelings
with
the
toe
of
a
boot
no
victim
offered
himself
however
and
the
little
and
i
rolled
up
together
in
my
ponchos
on
the
dirt
floor
to
spend
a
night
during
which
the
rain
poured
as
it
seldom
does

the
upper

capital
from
the
summit
of

we
were
off
at
daylight
as
travelers
should
be
along
a
fertile
valley
the
rain
had
given
the
morning
a
scent
of
fresh
lushness
rare
in
the
dry
andes
birds
sang
gaily
in
the
willows
along
the
stream
and
great
masses
of
clouds
lay
banked
in
the
hollows
of
the
mountains
then
came
another
mighty
climb
to
a
stagnant
lagoon
and
the
usual
hundred
yards
or
so
of
level
going
before
we
pitched
down
another
of
the
stony
that
seem
to
shake
all
the
bolts
of
the
anatomy
loose
like
a
runaway
railway
train
bumping
over
the
ties
suddenly
there
disclosed
itself
to
view
one
of
those
andean
vistas
so
tantalizing
to
the
photographer
since
any
attempt
to
reproduce
them
on
a
film
results
only
in
a
waste
of
effort
and
material
the
earth
had
been
scolloped
out
into
an
enormous
valley
with
a
very
green
river
racing
amazonward
far
down
in
its
rocky
gorge
hundreds
of
little
patches
newly
plowed
to
await
the
rain
were
scattered
far
and
near
on
all
the
fertile
enclosing
mountainsides
that
rose
higher
and
higher
as
we
descended
each
indian
chacra
showed
two
tiny
white
houses
connected
by
a
high
wall
which
no
doubt
enclosed
the
corral
least
at
a
their
specklessness
then
far
far
off
across
a
vast
expanse
of
gashed
and
tumbled
valley
at
the
back
of
a
great
tilted
field
broken
into
squares
of
the
of
alternating
with
the
deeper
line
of
alfalfares
with
a
ribbon
of
road
winding
to
and
swallowed
up
within
it
could
be
plainly
made
out
the
little
city
of
abancay
backed
by
mountains
capped
with
clouds
the
brilliant
sun
had
reduced
things
again
to
the
old
familiar
condition
making
a
torture
the
long
perpetual
zigzag
down
to
the
river
pachachaca
flowing
north
through
a
deep
cleft
in
the
mountains
to
the
hot
amazonian
montaña
and
the
atlantic
the
gleam
of
its
blue
waters
tantalizing
to
our
choking
desert
thirst
i
reached
at
last
the
stone
and
cement
bridge
of
graceful
arch
straddling
the
gorge
only
to
find
to
my
dismay
that
this
passed
high
out
of
reach
of
the
water
but
we
would
not
be
choked
thus
in
plain
sight
of
the
inviting
stream
i
turned
chusquito
up
along
the
bank
and
tramped
a
long
distance
through
cactus
and
chaparral
dust
and
tropical
heat
without
finding
a
break
in
the
precipitous
bank
at
last
unable
to
endure
the
tantalizing
sight
longer
i
took
chance
by
the
forelock
and
dragged
the
animal
down
through
the
clutching
trees
and
undergrowth
as
far
as
he
could
possibly
go
then
unloaded
him
standing
on
a
huge
rock
as
on
a
pedestal
and
carried
my
junk
the
rest
of
the
way
to
a
shady
spot
beside
the
racing
stream
there
i
cooked
ate
read
wrote
bathed
washed
all
my
available
clothing
and
napped
and
it
was
before
i
had
loaded
again
the
little
son
of
the
had
fallen
behind
in
the
long
descent
as
i
ate
he
crossed
the
bridge
above
but
though
i
fired
my
revolver
several
times
to
attract
his
attention
he
went
on
unheeding
all
the
four
hours
had
been
burdened
with
the
worry
of
perhaps
finding
it
impossible
to
get
chusquito
back
again
up
that
jungled
precipice
and
but
the
little
beast
climbed
it
like
a
chamois
in
his
native
mountains
though
a
real
horse
would
have
refused
to
attempt
it
abancay
is
one
of
the
most
insignificant
of
department
capitals
the
lowest
and
most
nearly
tropical
city
of
all
this
trip
hot
as
it
is
there
are
snowclads
close
behind
and
seeming
hardly
a
away
from
the
town
and
back
along
the
valley
through
which
we
had
come
the
double
indian
houses
stood
out
as
clear
white
specks
far
up
the
perpendicular
mountain
walls
fifteen
and
even
twenty
miles
away
the
place
has
probably
fewer
than
inhabitants
of
whom
easily
ninety
percent
are
more
or
less
indian
the
few
whites
being
chiefly
importations
in
the
form
of
government
officials
the
town
is
not
old
and
is
somewhat
built
to
order
yet
it
has
not
only
electric
lights
but
a

is
a
simple

designed
by
my
former
host

to
a
local
hero
who
rose
to
the
lofty
heights
of
a
department
prefectship
one
of
the
few
artistic
things
in

because
of
its
absence
of

was
again
worth
nearly
its

as

common
among
the

turning
the

is
also
a

its

to
attain
white

by
acid
treatment
some
of
the

women
are
decidedly
pretty
in

of
their
habits
but
as
so
often
with
their
sex
the
world
over
once
they
begin
to
suspect
that
fact
they
are
prone
to
attempt
to
improve
on
nature
with
distressing
results
every
woman
wears
the
a
square
of

richly
embroidered
and
worked
with
flowers
about
her
shoulders
in
it
a

is
carried
when
the

not

none
go

this
article
of

he
who
does
not
look
closely
will
scarcely
notice
whether
the
dicclla
is
full
of
baby
or
is
empty
in
my
first
stroll
about
town
i
came
upon
the
boy
of
andahuaylas
in
one
of
the
huts
on
the
outskirts
where
he
was
evidently
avoiding
me
because
he
had
five
eggs
i
had
given
him
to
carry
he
had
fallen
in
with
friends
and
demonstrated
his
temperament
by
giving
up
his
plan
to
walk
to
cuzco
the

trujillo

like
abancay
more
easily
imagined
than
described
a
rectangle
full
of
flapping
with
garments
of
both
sexes
of
indian
and
chola
women
and
children
of
all
degrees
of
ignorance
of
soap
of
parrots
turkeys
a
belligerent
goose
chickens
without
number
countless
yellow
curs
a
dozen
fat
and
pigs
and
an
occasional
drunken
man
formed
its
center
a
wall
it
from
the
barnyard
and
kitchen
beneath
which
flowed
an
open
sewer
and
my
room
was
an
ancient
lopsided
scarfaced
airless
den
opening
directly
off
this
with
the
dust
of
ages
on
its
battered
and
medieval
furniture
the
longer
of
the
two
maltreated
wooden
platforms
on
legs
that
posed
as
bedsteads
was
at
least
a
foot
shorter
than
i
though
i
make
no
great
requirements
in
that
respect
and
i
had
either
to
hang
my
legs
over
the
of
the
footboard
or
thrust
one
out
at
each
corner
in
these
andean
hostelries
the
landlord
may
hover
around
the
guest
on
the
day
of
his
arrival
chiefly
out
of
curiosity
commanding
the
servants
who
furnish
the
room
to
order
but
he
never
does
so
on
the
succeeding
days
as
his
attention
is
fully
taken
up
with
the
little
grocery
drunkery
and
on
which
his
real
income
depends
and
one
is
lucky
indeed
to
lay
hands
once
a
day
on
a
servant
to
bring
a
pitcher
of
water
and
empty
the
basura
as
to
a
clean
towel
or
a
change
of
sheets
the
only
way
to
obtain
them
whatever
the
length
of
stay
is
to
move
to
another
the
unlikely
event
that
one
exists
but
the
accomplished
bachelor
prefers
on
the
whole
to
be
his
own
chambermaid
rather
than
admit
to
his
room
the
average
variety
of
andean
hotel
servant
the
service
was
genuinely
table
d
hôte
in
that
we
gathered
around
the
table
with
the
entire
family
of
our
host
his
children
dogs
and
chickens
some
local
government
officials
and
the
ubiquitous
german
with
his
stale
jokes
and
attempts
to
make
himself
on
sunday
we
had
to
dinner
a
but
still
bright
old
lady
who
claimed
to
remember
the
battle
of
ayacucho
years
before
and
to
have
seen
as
a
small
girl
the
beaten
spaniards
racing
through
dead
man
s
yacarias
had
learned
none
of
those
tricks
of
his
tribe
that
are
the
burden
of
the
traveler
almost
the
world
over
though
his
rates
were
ninety
cents
a
day
he
refused
to
collect
for
the
meal
or
two
i
ran
over
and
when
i
left
he
forced
upon
me
a
roast
chicken
for
my
or
road
lunch
as
a
little
moreover
to
my
astonishment
he
actually
had
chusquito
back
from
his
pasture
and
tied
in
the
patio
with
a
juicy
bundle
of
alfalfa
before
him
by
the
time
the
religious
fiesta
had
sunk
into
its
drunken
sleep
and
quiet
had
settled
down
over
the
andes
to
have
a
promise
to
do
a
thing
and
then
to
do
it
the
same
day
was
a
experience
indeed
we
were
off
at
the
crack
of
dawn
on
the
last
stage
of
my
march
to
the
ancient
capital
of
the
inca
empire
that
eagerness
the
traveler
always
feels
in
nearing
the
scene
of
boyhood
dreams
caused
me
to
scold
chusquito
more
than
usual
for
not
keeping
out
from
underfoot
on
the
famous
climb
to
the
next
mountain
notch
with
its
or
on
which
indians
are
said
to
have
tossed
their
since
long
before
the
conquest
the
descent
was
even
swifter
and
by
three
we
had
ended
the
nine
leagues
to
curahuasi
a
scattered
collection
of
huts
on
a
high
shelf
of
mountain
chusquito
had
brought
with
him
his
own
dinner
wrapped
in
my
rubber
poncho
in
the
form
of
a
wad
of
alfalfa
he
had
not
been
able
to
finish
in
abancay
but
though
he
managed
to
make
away
with
it
he
seemed
to
prefer
the
short
dry
of
the
central
plaza
consisting
of
a
large
open
space
adorned
by
one
lone
eucalyptus
i
was
soon
possessor
of
the
key
and
padlock
of
the
an
empty
mud
cave
furnished
by
the
municipalidad
to
which
the
traveler
is
as
legally
entitled
as
to
lodging
in
a
french
de
the
same
building
included
the
jail
full
of
the
aftermath
of
the
religious
fiesta
in
the
persons
of
indians
thrusting
their
faces
through
the
wooden
bars
of
the
single
window
imploring
liquor
and
tobacco
but
though
i
had
wine
chicha
and
pisco
and
peruvian
prisoners
are
permitted
anything
they
can
lay
hands
on
it
seemed
wiser
to
let
them
reflect
on
the
error
of
their
ways
the
ragged
came
to
inquire
if
he
should
send
a
cholita
to
keep
me
company
and
seemed
to
consider
my
negative
reply
a
personal
affront
now
and
then
an
indian
all
but
hidden
under
a
load
of
green
alfalfa
loped
across
the
plaza
pursued
by
several
asses
taking
a
bite
at
every
jump
it
is
the
custom
in
this
region
for
all
aboriginals
men
women
or
children
to
snatch
off
their
hats
and
murmur
buenas
tardes
the
time
of
every
white
man
if
i
failed
to
answer
they
repeated
that
inane
redundant
and
not
always
truthful
remark
in
a
loud
distressed
voice
until
i
replied
as
if
they
feared
some
punishment
unless
their
greeting
was
returned
when
it
came
to
every
passerby
thus
insisting
on
recognition
as
often
as
he
passed
the
cabildo
doorway
in
which
i
sat
writing
my
notes
it
was
hard
to
refrain
from
replying

which
she
thrusts
out

the
servants
at
her
nefarious
concoctions
birds
were
singing
merrily
in
the
molle
trees
when
we
descended
a
bristling
with
cactus
then
through
precipitous
stony
quebradas
at
the
bottoms
of
which
excited
streams
rushed
headlong
down
from
the
mountain
heights
in
their
haste
to
join
the
unseen
river
below
on
its
journey
to
the
atlantic
we
were
approaching
the
famous
apurímac
the
roar
of
whose
waters
already
came
up
to
us
and
the
crossing
of
which
travelers
have
always
looked
forward
to
with
misgiving
yet
it
was
only
a
very
moderate
river
we
came
in
sight
of
in
exceedingly
far
down
in
the
precipitous
gorge
it
has
cut
for
itself
during
the
centuries
the
descent
seemed
endless
the
road
wound
incessantly
round
the
mountain
far
up
each
profound
ravine
and
back
again
so
that
a
walk
was
barely
a
gain
travelers
now
were
numerous
with
goods
from
the
outside
world
by
way
of
cuzco
appeared
as
dots
on
the
crest
of
the
range
beyond
and
crawled
slowly
down
its
barren
face
indians
bearing
on
their
backs
chickens
pigs
or
the
scanty
produce
of
their
chacras
climbed
past
us
into
the
hot
world
above
the
blazing
sun
stood
sheer
overhead
when
we
reached
the
river
or
more
exactly
tablachaca
the
high
above
it
since
long
before
the
conquest
the
swaying
inca
bridges
of
braided
withes
have
been
thrown
across
this
mighty
gorge
at
various
points
so
that
the
passing
of
the
apurímac
has
long
been
synonymous
with
taking
one
s
life
in
one
s
hands
but
the
tameness
of
modern
times
has
intruded
even
here
a
solid
bridge
built
by
a
philadelphian
and
maintained
not
by
the
government
but
by
the
neighboring
hacendados
carries
the
traveler
across
without
a
tremor
in
an
openwork
hut
beside
it
live
the
a
curiously
old
youth
and
his
mother
boasting
themselves
the
grandson
and
daughter
respectively
of
the
builder
yet
so
purely
peruvian
that
they
can
not
even
pronounce
the
name
of
their
illustrious
ancestor
finding
it
possible
to
descend
to
the
river
by
a
series
of
natural
stone
steps
i
determined
to
enjoy
the
distinction
of
a
dip
into
the
famous
stream
the
astonished
wished
to
know
if
i
was
a
great
swimmer
as
their
father
and
grandfather
from
philadelphia
had
been
and
could
i
even
him
by
swimming
clear
across
the
river
i
admitted
that
i
could
come
near
to
making
it
if
there
were
a
sheriff
s
posse
at
my
heels
and
no
bridge
but
neither
of
those
contingencies
staring
me
in
the
face
i
saw
no
reason
to
risk
coming
home
by
way
of
the
amazon
in
the
garb
of
adam
by
attempting
a
gratuitous
stunt
worthy
of
a
genuine
andarín
as
i
stood
soaping
my
frame
however
i
fell
to
wondering
why
pedro
de
la
gasca
should
have
lost
most
of
his
horses
and
mules
here
on
the
way
to
his
famous
game
with
gonzalo
pizarro
on
the
field
of
xaquixaguana
for
though
it
snarled
and
fretted
against
its
rocky
barriers
with
considerable
force
and
speed
to
any
but
a
people
the
stream
lapping
at
my
knees
would
not
exactly
seem
a
great
river
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
his
misfortune
must
have
been
due
to
the
fact
that
pedro
was
a
priest
and
to
test
the
theory
swam
across
sat
a
moment
against
the
sheer
rock
wall
that
bounds
the
resounding
gorge
on
the
further
side
and
swam
back
again
true
the
stream
moved
with
something
more
than
peruvian
energy
and
not
far
below
there
was
a
fall
with
a
threatening
hollow
roar
where
the
man
so
foolish
as
to
let
himself
be
carried
over
might
have
sustained
a
few
bumps
and
gashes
but
there
was
nothing
in
the
escapade
to
get
excited
over
much
less
to
lose
one
s
horses
imagine
my
surprise
therefore
as
i
gripped
my
prehensile
toes
once
more
on
the
hither
bank
to
discover
just
in
time
to
save
myself
from
shattering
the
proprieties
to
fragments
that
all
the
surrounding
countryside
large
and
small
male
and
female
indian
and
was
hanging
over
the
precipice
and
bridge
above
watching
with
open
mouths
my
marvelous
and
unprecedented
feat
as
i
climbed
the
bank
reclad
the
vigilante
del
puente
and
his
mother
fell
upon
me
insisting
that
such
unrivalled
prowess
should
not
pass
unrecorded
and
getting
possession
of
my
they
spent
most
of
the
afternoon
in
concocting
a
certificate
of
my
adventure
with
all
the
signatures
rúbricas
and
seals
thereunto
appertaining
beyond
the
river
now
in
the
great
department
of
cuzco
we
climbed
a
sheer
mountain
face
and
descended
with
sunset
to
a
mass
of
buildings
on
a
bluff
among
immense
stretches
of
canefields
this
was
the
hacienda
la
estrella
of
senator
montes
whom
official
duties
held
in
lima
but
whose
son
once
he
had
overcome
his
racial
prejudice
against
a
man
who
came
on
foot
and
without
a
servant
appointed
an
indian
valet
to
chusquito
and
took
upon
himself
my
entertainment
his
newly
constructed
mansion
boasted
all
modern
improvements
from
electric
lights
to
paintings

the
walls
of

and

so
on

at

as
we
sat
the

his
white
overseers
and
the
the
door
of
the
cabin
that
had
been
assigned
me
the
tropical
full
moon
casting
over
the
scene
a
brightness
almost
equal
to
that
of
a
sunny
day
a
hundred
picturesquely
clad
indian
peons
carrying
medieval
hoes
and
axes
lined
up
before
us
for
then
scattered
to
their
huts
the
hacienda
s
vast
army
of
laborers
refuse
for
the
most
part
to
live
in
the
houses
in
long
identical
rows
of
which
my
own
lodging
was
one
but
insisted
with
the
conservatism
so
deeply
engrained
in
their
race
on
building
their
own
huts
of
far
poorer
accommodations
each
peon
was
given
a
piece
of
land
on
which
to
erect
his
dwelling
and
plant
his
garden
free
pasturage
for
a
few
animals
and
a
wage
of
cents

day
when
he
worked
for
the
hacienda

he
did
only
every
other
month
and
thanks
to
church
festivals
and
the
concentrated
with
which
they
are
enlivened
by
no
means
all
the
days
of
that
the
women
had
no
obligations
to
the
hacienda
but
lived
on
it
merely
as
appendices
to
their
maids
of
course
are
unknown
among
south
american
only
such
work
about
the
as
they
could
be
coaxed
to
do
or
what
they
were
ordered
by
their
under
the
moon
the
gathering
of
grew
reminiscent
and
on
every
hand
floated
stories
of
peru
ending
with
one
by
the
son
which
explained
why
montes
the
elder
had
become
wealthy
and
a
senator
and
had
had
such
extraordinary
he
had
picked
up
at
the
chicago
exposition
twenty
years
before
a
horseshoe
which
was
still
carefully
guarded
the
moon
had
set
though
the
forerunner
of
day
had
not
yet
appeared
when
after
trying
in
vain
to
punch
awake
the
peon
montes
had
ordered
to
attend
me
i
entered
the
immense
hacienda
corral
to
or
fish
out
as
the
peruvians
say
my
horselet
from
the
army
of
mules
and
horses
munching
the
dry
pulp
of
crushed
sugarcane
that
constitutes
the
fodder
of
these
regions
i
had
no
difficulty
in
recognizing
my
own
animal
in
the
dark
not
only
by
his
diminutiveness
but
by
his
picturesquely
docked
tail
looking
back
on
that
day
however
i
am
sorry
i
did
not
pescar
another
animal
by
mistake
as
i
prepared
to
load
him
before
my
cabin
door
i
was
startled
to
find
that
chusquito
seemed
to
have
turned
zebra
during
the
night
several
dark
lines
ran
from
his
spine
down
either
side
to
his
shaggy
belly
the
sense
of
smell
astonished
me
with
the
information
that
these
were
of
blood
i
got
water
and
washed
him
off
meanwhile
cursing
the
savage
mules
that
had
evidently
spent
most
of
the
night
biting
the
helpless
little
brute
as
a
former
zone
policeman
trained
to
arrest
every
panamanian
coachman
who
dared
enter
the
canal
zone
with
a
horse
i
had
taken
extreme
care
to
keep
my
own
animal
free
from
those
so
atrociously
frequent
and
unattended
in
the
andes
but
the
soft
alforjas
could
not
add
to
his
injuries
i
too
had
been
bitten
until
my
frame
was
one
single
expanse
of
tattooing
and
chusquito
must
bear
his
share
of
troubles
unavoidable
in
the
tropics
i
arranged
the
load
as
carefully
as
possible
and
we
were
off
it
was
not
long
however
before
i
realized
that
something
perhaps
the
impossibility
of
eating
during
the
night
had
decidedly
sapped
my
companion
s
strength
he
did
not
tramp
with
his
vim
the
joy
of
life
seemed
to
have
departed
from
him
i
moderated
my
pace
thinking
my
haste
to
reach
the
climax
of
my
south
american
journey
was
unconsciously
causing
me
to
outdo
the
pace
we
had
long
since
agreed
upon
still
he
would
not
keep
out
from
under
my
feet
for
almost
the
first
time
in
our
acquaintance
i
found
it
necessary
to
touch
him
up
with
a
stick
we
were
moving
along
a
hollow
amid
the
deafening
scream
of
parrakeets
with
an
occasional
sharp
dip
into
and
climb
out
of
a
stony
quebrada
from
which
i
had
almost
to
carry
him
by
main
force
he
moved
like
a
clock
that
was
running
down
and
for
the
life
of
me
i
could
not
contrive
the
means
of
winding
him
up
again
then
all
at
once
i
realized
what
had
befallen
him
the
poor
misused
brute
had
been
bitten
not
by
mules
but
by
those
loathsome
vampire
bats
of
tropical
valleys
that
sometimes
find
even
human
victims
for
their
propensities
illustration
a
religious
procession
in
abancay
note
the
group
of
urchins
in
the
vying
with
each
other
in
beating
the
bells
into
an
uproar
we
crawled
at
last
into
the
mud
village
of
limatambo
only
to
be
informed
that
there
was
no
alfalfa
in
town
and
that
we
must
push
on
at
least
to
the
hacienda
challabamba
half
a
league
up
the
valley
as
we
turned
toward
it
i
was
startled
to
find
the
way
bordered
by
a
splendid
wall
of
cut
stone
about
which
the
effete
modern
inhabitants
had
pitched
their
miserable
mud
huts
for
here
commanding
the
narrow
entrance
to
the
valley
stood
one
of
those
four
fortresses
with
which
the
ancient
emperors
of
tavantinsuyo
had
defended
at
some
twelve
leagues
from
the
capital
the
highways
radiating
to
the
four
corners
of
the
earth
chusquito
had
lost
all
response
to
any
species
of
outside
influence
push
as
i
would
putting
my
shoulder
to
the
would
say
digging
my
toes
into
the
trail
we
could
not
advance
a
mile
an
hour
the
drooping
animal
took
a
half
minute
to
lift
each
separate
foot
a
pebble
caused
him
to
stumble
a
rock
step
made
him
groan
audibly
he
did
not
look
particularly
he
was
fatter
if
anything
than
the
day
i
had
bought
him
and
surely
even
a
man
could
have
gone
the
mile
or
two
more
on
his
instead
he
came
to
a
complete
standstill
this
would
never
do
at
least
we
must
reach
the
hacienda
and
its
much
as
it
grieved
me
to
raise
a
hand
against
a
faithful
companion
i
rapped
him
soundly
across
the
quarters
with
my
stick
he
uttered
a
sudden
pathetic
groan
and
dropped
in
the
middle
of
the
road
as
suddenly
as
a
bull
in
a
spanish
his
legs
quivered
a
moment
his
eyes
opened
wide
closed
then
opened
again
in
a
glassy
stare
despite
all
my
blustering
before
soulless
gobernadores
who
would
have
starved
him
in
the
midst
of
plenty
despite
all
my
struggles
to
find
him
food
when
even
i
had
gone
without
the
patient
little
brute
had
come
to
this
sad
end
never
had
i
felt
the
loss
of
a
traveling
companion
more
keenly
for
six
weeks
we
had
toiled
together
over
lofty
andean
ranges
across
vast
páramos
with
nothing
in
sight
but
their
dreary
nothingness
how
often
had
we
not
listened
to
each
other
contentedly
dining
in
our
adjacent
chambers
at
the
end
of
a
laborious
day
if
we
had
had
differences
they
had
been
only
those
which
arise
between
all
beings
with
wills
of
their
own
joined
together
on
a
long
journey
and
the
end
of
that
journey
had
been
so
near
at
hand
i
had
long
looked
forward
to
our
triumphal
entry
into
cuzco
together
to
having
our
pictures
proudly
taken
side
by
side
in
the
main
plaza
and
to
the
pleasure
of
presenting
him
as
a
pet
to
the
children
of
the
one
american
i
knew
dwelt
in
the
ancient
it
turn
out
that
the
latter
had
any
such
he
might
toil
no
more
and
end
his
days
in
the
beloved
mountain
air
of
his
native
heights
instead
of
which
here
i
sat
on
the
edge
of
a
peruvian
trail
gazing
at
a
shattered
dream
stiffening
in
the
blazing
sunshine
before
me
but
the
experienced
traveler
will
not
let
misfortune
long
interfere
with
the
regular
flow
of
his
existence
behind
the
bristling
cactus
hedges
lining
the
road
were
several
indian
hovels
i
risked
leaving
alone
what
was
left
of
my
possessions
to
walk
to
the
nearest
some
fifty
yards
away
two
arrieros
a
boy
and
a
woman
were
lounging
within
it
the
muleteers
spoke
a
quichua
somewhat
different
from
that
i
had
picked
up
moreover
they
were
half
drunk
i
offered
them
a
good
reward
to
toss
my
stuff
on
one
of
their
grazing
mules
and
carry
it
to
but
they
were
bound
for
la
estrella
five
or
six
hours
could
not
turn
back
perhaps
it
brings
bad
luck
the
woman
would
not
be
compromised
even
to
the
extent
of
admitting
my
existence
as
a
final
straw
the
boy
refused
a
peseta
to
carry
a
note
to
the
hacienda
i
returned
to
the
scene
of
the
disaster
and
sat
down
hopelessly
in
the
shrinking
shadow
of
the
hedge
the
connecting
link
between
a
sahib
and
his
baggage
kept
running
like
a
refrain
through
my
head
indian
travelers
and
passed
to
and
fro
staring
curiously
and
seeming
in
so
far
as
the
impassive
indian
face
shows
anything
to
smirk
with
satisfaction
at
my
plight
at
least
i
could
pull
my
belongings
off
the
corpse
though
not
easily
with
the
and
the
ropes
wound
round
and
round
the
body
luckily
the
animal
had
fallen
on
the
side
carrying
my
city
clothing
and
had
spared
the
i
disentangled
my
still
existent
possessions
and
piled
them
beside
me
in
the
shade
an
hour
crawled
by
another
was
crawling
something
must
be
done
i
could
neither
leave
my
baggage
unprotected
here
beside
one
of
the
four
royal
highways
leading
into
or
out
of
the
city
of
the
on
which
way
one
was
going
were
one
going
at
could
i
carry
it
myself
such
was
the
bulk
to
which
it
had
accumulated
i
drew
out
a
that
proof
of
the
caballero
caste
in
south
america
and
wrote
upon
it
vengo

los
señores

ha
muerto

para
que

the
owners
of
challabamba
were
relatives
of
my
host
of
the
first
night
out
of
andahuaylas
and
he
had
implored
me
to
stop
with
them
as
to
the
horse
it
was
best
not
to
try
to
explain
offhand
that
it
was
not
one
i
had
been
riding
awaiting
my
chance
i
picked
out
an
old
indian
woman
stubbing
along
the
stony
rising
trail
twirling
her
ubiquitous
and
explained
to
her
in
my
most
fluent
and
incaic
not
to
say
archaic
quichua
that
she
was
to
give
the
note
to
don
francisco
when
she
passed
his
hacienda
but
like
most
of
her
race
sent
on
errands
she
probably
forgot
it
or
concluded
i
didn
t
mean
what
i
had
said
or
thought
of
some
other
incomprehensible
reason
for
not
delivering
it
such
as
not
having
the
consent
of
her
or
father
confessor
or
she
decided
to
keep
it
as
fuel
or
don
francisco
was
no
stá
cá
as
usual
or
he
didn
t
care
to
have
travelers
recomendado
by
his
relatives
or
qué
sé
yo
the
empty
blazing
minutes
expanded
into
half
hours
these
in
turn
into
hours
and
still
life
drifted
eventlessly
on
i
dug
out
a
battered
copy
of
marcus
aurelius
and
strove
to
pass
the
time
as
pleasantly
as
possible
until
fate
saw
fit
to
make
a
suggestion
limping
old
epictetus
would
have
been
far
more
to
the
point
under
the
circumstances
the
sun
drew
relentlessly
away
on
its
westward
journey
the
handful
of
shade
crawled
on
all
fours
under
the
cactus
hedge
and
spread
into
the
uninviting
field
beyond
i
transferred
my
sundry
not
to
say
chattels
to
the
other
side
of
the
road
and
continued
my
reading
an
old
fellow
hobbled
past
and
desired
to
know
what
i
was
doing
there
i
replied
that
the
densest
of
human
beings
could
see
that
i
was
installing
an
electric
plant
and
could
he
as
quite
evidently
the
oldest
resident
of
these
parts
and
a
man
of
extraordinary
intelligence
suggest
any
means
of
starting
the
dynamo
his
brilliant
but
not
wholly
unexpected
reply
was
where
do
you
come
from
where
are
you
going
if
one
dragged
a
peruvian
out
of
bed
at
midnight
to
say
that
his
wife
had
just
hanged
herself
in
the
patio
and
should
be
cut
down
as
soon
as
convenient
he
would
certainly
cry
y
á
onde
vueno
i
finally
stirred
up
his
drivelling
intellect
to
the
point
where
he
announced
himself
the
owner
of
a
small
hacienda
not
far
away
and
he
promised
that
as
soon
as
he
returned
from
a
social
call
up
the
road
he
would
see
whether
he
had
an
animal
that
could
carry
my
stuff
to
his
house
and
an
indian
that
cared
to
fetch
it
i
picked
up
my
book
once
just
then
chusquito
raised
his
head
and
gazed
listlessly
about
him
like
one
of
the
opposite
sex
coming
out
of
a
faint
or
one
of
our
own
regaining
the
first
consciousness
of
the
cold
gray
dawn
of
a
morning
after
then
getting
unsteadily
to
his
feet
that
deceitful
ungrateful
rascal
stood
up
staggered
through
the
cactus
hedge
and
fell
to
nibbling
the
stubble
of
the
field
beyond
the
octogenarian
had
not
mentioned
the
date
of
his
proposed
return
and
whatever
it
was
it
had
not
arrived
when
there
appeared
along
the
road
i
would
have
traveled
a
in
some
clothing
and
the
same
kind
of
spanish
leading
a
stout
empty
mule
don
francisco
as
i
had
suspected
was
not
at
home
and
la
señora
had
evidently
slept
the
siesta
on
the
note
before
acting
upon
it
chusquito
though
on
his
feet
again
was
of
course
too
weak
to
be
reloaded
and
even
in
the
clothes
he
stood
in
i
could
only
drag
him
along
a
few
feet
to
the
minute
by
pulling
like
a
more
exactly
a
dutch
a
canal
the
inscrutable
with
the
mule
bearing
my
baggage
bringing
up
the
funereal
rear
a
score
of
times
i
was
on
the
point
of
abandoning
the
derelict
far
from
port
and
alfalfa
but
contained
myself
in
patience
recalling
the
former
virtues
of
the
deceiving
creature
and
sweated
at
last
with
him
into
the
hacienda
corral
the
estate
was
just
then
in
supreme
command
of
a
woman
of
such
cold
indifference
to
my
sad
tale
that
she
might
as
well
have
spoken
only
quichua
instead
of
being
so
versed
in
spanish
that
she
was
performing
the
extraordinary
feat
for
a
south
american
of
reading
a
novel
of
dumas
in
that
tongue
the
parlor
of
the
low
adobe
building
was
papered
with
the
pages
of
illustrated
weeklies
from
many
lands
and
in
many
languages
and
there
the
illustrious
and
the
notorious
of
all
countries
rubbed
shoulders
latest
champion
of
the
fistic
world
beside
the
dome
of
an
experienced
american
presidential
candidate
the
pope
in
the
act
of
blessing
a
group
of
mexican
bandits
the
american
rector
of
the
university
of
cuzco
arm
in
arm
as
it
were
with
a
famous
spanish
in
a
corner
of
the
corral
chusquito
had
fallen
upon
a
heap
of
alfalfa
in
a
way
to
show
that
whatever
his
appearance
he
was
far
from
dead
but
the
hacienda
people
assured
me
the
animal
could
not
possibly
carry
my
stuff
to
cuzco
that
like
a
nervous
breakdown
his
ailment
called
for
long
rest
and
weeks
of
good
feeding
i
might
perder
cuidado
however
as
they
would
lend
me
a
chusco
and
an
indian
for
the
rest
of
the
journey
from
their
careful
avoidance
of
any
suggestions
on
the
subject
it
was
evident
that
they
fancied
i
would
leave
chusquito
where
he
was
and
that
they
would
automatically
fall
heir
to
him
i
may
look
like
that
in
my
pictures
but
photography
is
at
best
deceiving
moreover
i
had
not
forgotten
that
it
is
a
common
human
failing
to
take
far
less
care
of
that
which
is
given
than
of
that
which
is
bought
a
wily
old
compadre
of
the
family
smelling
how
the
wind
blew
said
he
would
buy
the
animal
himself
were
it
not
that
he
had
only
that
week
finished
and
a
won
a
lawsuit
against
some
franciscan
friars
for
the
possession
of
an
hacienda
and
was
penniless
in
consequence
the
brother
of
the
absent
don
francisco
who
chanced
to
ride
over
from
his
neighboring
hacienda
assured
me
the
eighteen
i
had
paid
in
huancayo
was
an
atrocious
price
and
after
the
rest
of
the
usual
prelude
to
a
bargain
in
peru
offered
me
eight
i
forgot
myself
and
accepted
too
quickly
whereupon
he
walked
slowly
around
the
animal
until
finding
a
discolored
fetlock
or
some
other
fatal
blemish
he
lightly
broke
his
word
and
offered
six
after
a
sharp
and
scintillating
exchange
of
gypsying
i
pocketed
seven
and
sadly
watched
the
constant
companion
of
my
most
pleasant
six
weeks
on
the
road
in
peru
led
slowly
away
to
a
large
green
spot
up
the
valley
the
order
of
his
new
master
to
give
him
all
the
alfalfa
he
could
eat
ringing
in
his
ears
yet
i
knew
only
too
well
his
preference
for
the
tough
páramo
grasses
of
his
native
upper
heights
la
señora
had
promised
that
i
should
start
by
six
whence
it
was
unusually
good
luck
that
i
actually
dashed
out
through
the
hacienda
gate
at
seven
my
possessions
behind
me
on
a
little
gray
chusco
in
charge
of
one
of
the
indians
of
the
region
sent
to
lead
the
animal
to
cuzco
and
back
the
first
half
of
his
task
did
not
last
long
after
i
had
paused
to
wait
for
him
a
dozen
times
or
more
in
the
first
furlong
i
came
back
to
kick
him
off
the
end
of
the
and
take
personal
charge
of
the
expedition
gradually
the
great
valley
where
chusquito
had
found
the
end
of
his
journeyings
shrunk
to
a
hollow
in
the
earth
then
to
a
mere
hole
wavy
blue
with
distance
that
finally
disappeared
forever
from
my
eyes
the
brown
pampa
and
exhilarating
air
of
upper
heights
appeared
once
more
with
magnificent
views
of
the
andes
on
every
hand
as
far
as
the
eye
could
range
the
wooden
indian
disappeared
for
hours
and
i
fancied
i
was
rid
of
him
for
the
rest
of
the
journey
but
he
caught
up
and
dropped
at
the
roadside
with
an
almost
audible
sigh
of
relief
the
coca
quid
still
in
his
cheek
the
bag
of
eggs
i
had
entrusted
to
him
still
intact
where
i
paused
for
dinner
on
the
edge
of
a
plain
that
had
evidently
once
been
a
the
mood
came
upon
me
to
treat
him
as
an
equal
to
see
what
the
effect
might
be
i
shared
with
him
such
a
meal
as
he
had
certainly
never
before
enjoyed
but
his
outward
expression
showed
neither
gratitude
nor
any
other
emotion
though
he
mumbled
the
customary
gracias
in
the
tone
one
would
expect
from
a
wooden
indian
a
more
passive
human
being
it
would
be
hard
to
imagine
he
ate
boiled
oatmeal
without
a
murmur
though
it
was
plain
he
neither
recognized
nor
liked
it
when
i
pointed
to
the
approaching
storm
and
murmured
rains
he
muttered
para
munanquichu
cocata
i
asked
ari
señor
he
mumbled
and
waited
like
a
stone
image
until
i
had
handed
him
a
pinch
of
coca
leaves
munanquichu
copita
ari
señor
and
he
drank
the
pisco
as
impassively
as
he
had
eaten
the
oatmeal
had
i
announced
that
it
was
snowing
or
asked
him
to
take
poison
i
should
have
expected
the
same
passive
acquiescence
the
plain
broadened
to
the
immense
pampa
de
anta
the
plain
of
xaquixaguana
of
prescott
stretching
to
on
either
hand
along
the
base
of
these
to
the
left
hung
some
splendid
examples
of
ancient
inca
or
terraced
fields
thousands
of
cattle
speckled
the
plain
in
every
direction
dim
villages
stood
forth
on
projecting
headlands
while
several
peered
over
the
bordering
range
to
the
north
the
ground
was
but
a
broad
partly
paved
raised
highway
stretched
straight
ahead
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
it
began
to
rain
it
always
does
on
the
pampa
de
anta
if
local
information
is
trustworthy
it
was
such
a
rain
as
one
rarely
encounters
in
the
high
andes
mixed
with
hail
and
punctuated
by
roaring
crashes
of
thunder
lightning
is
so
frequent
on
the
pampa
de
anta
that
natives
always
fee
their
favorite
saint
before
crossing
it
and
the
government
a
bit
more
materialistic
in
its
superstitions
has
provided
each
pole
of
the
telegraph
line
with
a
peruvian
had
advised
me
if
as
was
certain
i
should
be
overtaken
by
a
on
the
pampa
to
take
refuge
at
once
under
a
and
remain
there
until
the
storm
was
over
instead
i
splashed
on
wet
to
the
thighs
singing
between
the
crashes
of
thunder
so
great
was
my
joy
at
approaching
cuzco
as
the
storm
slackened
the
world
about
me
became
musical
with
the
chorus
of
frogs
all
day
the
costume
of
indians
had
been
gradually
changing
the
pancake
hat
of
cuzco
was
now
in
the
majority
the
knee
breeches
and
skirts
were
shorter
the
faces
were
distinctly
was
it
dirtier
even
more
stupid
than
the
type
with
which
i
had
grown
so
familiar
greetings
were
more
obsequious
than
ever
even
the
women
raised
their
hats
to
me
as
they
by
and
more
than
one
carried
my
thoughts
back
to
inca
days
by
a
respectful
buenas
tardes
it
became
evident
we
could
not
reach
cuzco
by
daylight
we
halted
at
izcochaca
the
indian
curling
up
in
a
far
corner
of
the
mud
corredor
assigned
us
with
only
his
thin
garb
upon
him
too
passive
to
find
himself
the
ragged
old
poncho
i
discovered
in
a
corner
and
threw
over
him
it
rained
most
of
the
night
making
much
of
the
twelve
miles
left
a
quagmire
broken
by
patches
of
atrocious
cobbling
no
conquistador
of
old
looked
forward
more
eagerly
than
i
to
the
first
glimpse
of
the
navel
of
the
inca
empire
yet
as
always
at
the
end
of
a
long
journey
the
last
miles
seemed
trebly
drawn
out
the
road
that
had
been
perfectly
level
since
the
preceding
noonday
began
to
clamber
over
bumps
and
rises
from
the
tops
of
each
of
which
i
strained
my
eyes
in
vain
for
the
sight
towns
grew
up
along
the
way
birds
sang
in
clumps
of
eucalypti
the
peon
slapped
sluggishly
along
behind
me
apparently
seeing
no
further
than
his
broad
vistas
of
a
tumbled
and
mountain
world
with
an
occasional
flash
of
the
long
snow
and
cordillera
spread
and
contracted
as
i
hurried
onward
the
road
passed
through
hollows
and
under
the
graceful
old
arch
of
an
aqueduct
ranging
away
with
giant
strides
across
the
rolling
uplands
but
still
no
city
again
and
again
i
topped
a
ridge
only
to
be
newly
disappointed
until
i
came
almost
to
fancy
this
was
only
some
dream
city
of
the
imagination
toward
which
we
were
headed
then
all
at
once
without
warning
the
road
dived
downward
turned
a
sharp
angle
and
there
below
and
before
me
in
of
october
lay
spread
out
in
all
its
extent
the
city
of
the
sun
like
the
passing
indians
i
too
paused
on
the
edge
of
the
rocky
shelf
and
was
almost
moved
to
follow
their
lead
in
snatching
off
my
hat
and
murmuring
reverently
o
ccoscco
hatun
llacta
napai
cuzco
great
city
i
salute
thee
for
to
the
aboriginals
cuzco
is
still
a
sanctified
spot
venerated
not
only
as
the
abode
of
the
incas
but
of
all
those
deities
that
still
in
spite
of
its
outward
christianity
preside
over
the
ancient
empire
of
tavantinsuyo
my
peon
showed
not
a
hint
of
surprise
when
i
knelt
to
make
a
tripod
of
stones
for
my
kodak
no
doubt
fancying
it
some
instrument
of
worship
it
was
quite
natural
any
human
being
should
set
up
at
first
sight
of
what
to
all
mankind
must
be
the
noblest
scene
in
all
the
world
in
a
way
his
veneration
was
justified
some
have
it
that
cuzco
is
superior
in
situation
to
even
bogotá
and
quito
in
physical
beauty
alone
this
is
not
quite
true
but
what
with
that
combined
with
its
historical
memories
there
are
few
such
fascinating
moments
in
the
traveler
s
experience
as
this
first
glimpse
of
the
ancient
inca
capital
i
for
one
at
least
looked
down
upon
it
with
a
thrill
exceeding
even
that
awakened
by
rome
or
jerusalem
the
city
covered
the
northern
and
more
elevated
end
of
a
plain
enclosed
by
mountain
flanks
and
dying
away
in
hazy
labyrinthian
distance
on
the
edge
of
the
ridge
on
which
we
stood
sacsahuaman
a
mere
knoll
from
this
height
with
its
fortress
frowned
down
upon
the
city
a
hulking
cathedral
faced
an
immense
plaza
faded
red
roofs
giving
the
scene
its
chief
color
until
this
broke
into
the
velvet
green
of
the
plain
which
in
turn
shaded
into
the
soft
brown
of
the
surrounding
ranges
but
neither
words
nor
photographs
can
give
more
than
a
faint
hint
of
the
charm
and
fascination
of
what
is
in
many
respects
the
most
interesting
spot
in
the
western
hemisphere
a
charm
enhanced
by
the
anticipation
of
a
long
overland
journey
there
came
upon
me
pity
for
the
tourist
who
comes
sneaking
into
the
famous
city
by
train
along
the
valley
below
this
in
its
turn
was
succeeded
by
a
regret
that
the
hands
of
time
could
not
be
set
back
years
to
the
day
when
balboa
first
peered
out
upon
the
pacific
that
i
might
sit
here
and
watch
the
activities
of
a
world
totally
different
from
that
we
know
a
regret
that
what
men
call
the
conquest
of
peru
ever
happened
what
days
were
those
when
there
were
really
new
worlds
to
discover
what
would
i
not
have
given
to
have
preceded
pizarro
a
been
provided
with
the
magic
cap
of
invisibility
to
save
me
from
being
served
up
as
an
exotic
delicacy
on
the
inca
s
table
a
swift
stony
descent
that
soon
became
a
regular
cobbled
stairway
once
topped
by
the
huancapuncu
or
west
gate
led
through
none
too
pleasantly
scented
suburbs
the
population
staring
agape
at
sight
of
a
white
man
in
and
belligerently
armed
descending
afoot
into
the
famous
city
the
chusco
and
indian
followed
at
my
heels
across
a
great
market
square
past
a
prettily
flowered
little
rectangle
and
i
marched
at
last
out
upon
the
broad
central
plaza
so
densely
populated
with
the
shades
of
history
i
had
loafed
away
days
since
leaving
huancayo
though
only
of
them
had
been
even
partly
spent
on
the
road
the
distance
had
proved
almost
exactly
miles
making
a
total
of
miles
that
i
had
covered
on
foot
since
hays
and
i
walked
out
of
the
central
plaza
of
bogotá
nearly
fourteen
months
before
the
city
of
the
sun
ancient
capital
of
the
inca
empire
which
garsilaso
called
cozco
and
stevenson
couzcou
is
but
a
shadow
of
its
once
imperial
grandeur
the
famous
inca
historian
states
that
the
name
corresponded
to
the
spanish
and
from
his
day
to
this
writers
have
referred
to
it
as
the
navel
of
the
inca
empire
educated
cuzqueños
of
deny
this
derivation
asserting
that
the
quichua
word
for
navel
is
and
always
has
been
the
talkative
old
successor
of
valverde
chanced
when
i
called
upon
him
to
have
just
been
reading
an
ancient
manuscript
in
which
the
words
crumbs
or
shavings
of
gold
occurred
frequently
in
the
description
of
the
city
and
he
held
this
to
be
the
real
origin
of
the
name
whatever
of
truth
or
exaggeration
there
may
have
been
in
the
statements
of
old
chroniclers
that
the
city
gleamed
with
gold
at
the
time
of
the
conquest
little
of
that
royal
aspect
remains
the
chief
and
almost
only
material
reminders
of
the
days
of
the
incas
are
long
walls
of
beautiful
cut
stone
in
the
central
portion
of
the
modern
city
indeed
in
all
peru
the
mementoes
of
the
ancient
race
are
almost
wholly
confined
to
walls
some
of
these
are
dressed
down
so
smoothly
that
the
joints
seem
mere
most
of
them
are
cyclopean
boulders
of
irregular
size
and
shape
similar
to
the
pitti
palace
in
florence
which
is
by
no
means
so
perfect
in
workmanship
there
are
almost
no
curved
or
circular
walls
the
chief
exception
to
this
being
the
former
temple
of
the
sun
now
the
dominican
monastery
where
like
mud
huts
superimposed
on
the
ruins
of
a
mighty
race
contented
old
friars
lounge
among
the
glories
of
long
ago
the
remnants
are
chiefly
street
after
street
in
which
the
old
walls
have
been
left
standing
from
six
to
twenty
feet
high
the
whitewashed
adobe
of
the
ambitionless
modern
descendants
above
them
for
the
most
part
these
form
only
one
side
of
each
street
for
the
passageways
of
the
incas
of
which
one
still
remains
intact
were
too
narrow
even
for
spanish
notions
but
the
city
of
is
still
defined
by
these
long
reaches
of
elaborately
cut
stones
which
legend
has
it
divided
the
ancient
capital
into
regular
squares
they
are
egyptian
in
aspect
these
massive
walls
shrinking
toward
the
top
as
do
the
rare
doors
and
openings
of
inca
construction
that
have
survived
here
and
there
they
have
been
rudely
torn
open
to
give
entrance
to
a
a
bakery
a
chicharia
or
it
would
seem
for
no
other
reason
than
the
mere
lust
for
destruction
everywhere
old
walls
stare
out
upon
the
passerby
with
indian
stolidity
as
if
refusing
to
tell
the
stories
they
might
so
easily
if
they
chose
even
where
the
walls
themselves
have
disappeared
to
furnish
building
material
for
the
churches
and
monasteries
of
the
conquerors
the
magnificent
doorways
have
sometimes
been
preserved
as
the
entrance
to
some
modern
hovel
and
give
a
suggestion
of
what
this
imperial
city
so
ruthlessly
destroyed
might
have
been
it
is
only
these
walls
and
the
historical
memories
with
which
they
are
saturated
that
distinguish
cuzco
from
any
other
city
of
the
sierra
the
life
of
the
place
is
drab
and
uninspiring
wellnigh
as
colorless
as
the
most
monotonous
village
of
the
andes
the
metropolis
no
doubt
of
the
western
hemisphere
in
the
fifteenth
century
in
the
twentieth
it
seems
a
little
backwater
almost
wholly
cut
off
from
the
main
stream
of
life
for
a
long
time
after
the
conquest
it
was
queen
of
the
andes
greater
even
than
lima
then
as
the
inca
highway
fell
into
decay
under
the
squabbling
and
incompetent
successors
of
the
provident
incas
it
shrunk
away
into
its
isolation
until
it
is
less
known
to
peru
itself
than
is
london
or
berlin
for
one
limeño
who
has
visited
cuzco
the
historical
gem
of
the
continent
a
hundred
have
journeyed
to
paris
the
conquistadores
fond
of
exaggerating
their
prowess
by
multiplying
the
numbers
of
their
defeated
enemies
ascribed
to
cuzco
inhabitants
this
is
inconceivable
a
trustworthy
census
taken
by
the
american
rector
of
the
university
a
few
weeks
before
my
arrival
shows
the
population
to
be
slightly
under
it
may
this
authority
fancies
have
numbered
at
the
time
of
the
conquest
the
percentage
of
marriages
was
found
to
be
extremely
low
though
the
holds
its
own
a
few
white
officials
and
what
would
be
called
petty
shopkeepers
elsewhere
are
in
evidence
otherwise
cuzco
has
chiefly
the
aspect
of
an
indian
town
its
plazas
too
vast
for
its
shrunken
population
an
ancient
chronicler
tells
us
that
through
the
heart
of
the
capital
ran
a
river
of
pure
water
its
sides
faced
with
stone
for
a
distance
of
twenty
granting
that
he
carelessly
wrote
leagues
when
he
would
have
said
none
but
a
spaniard
would
call
the
stream
a
river
and
the
purity
of
its
water
if
it
ever
existed
has
long
since
departed
this
huatenay
at
the
bottom
of
its
gorge
becomes
a
trickling
sewer
as
it
enters
the
town
passing
directly
beneath
the
principal
buildings
and
carrying
off
such
refuse
as
its
sluggishness
makes
possible
the
vast
central
plaza
far
from
level
and
once
even
larger
than
is
faced
as
usual
by
the
cathedral
second
only
to
that
of
lima
or
being
of
stone
rather
than
of
reeds
and
plaster
perhaps
to
be
rated
the
first
in
peru
there
is
something
of
the
soft
of
salamanca
about
the
churches
of
cuzco
that
calls
not
for
a
kodak
but
for
an
artist
the
plaster
interior
pretending
to
be
also
of
cut
stone
is
divided
after
the
spanish
custom
by
the
choir
with
splendid
carved
stalls
in
the
sacristy
are
ranged
the
dusky
portraits
of
all
the
bishops
of
cuzco
from
sophistical
old
valverde
to
him
of
the
theory
in
the
scented
twilight
of
the
nave
gather
all
the
motley
population
the
male
only
excepted
after
the
manner
of
andean
churches
dogs
are
not
permitted
to
enter
but
it
is
a
strange
rule
that
can
not
be
circumvented
i
have
seen
a
chola
pause
at
the
door
sling
her
puppy
in
the
manto
on
her
back
as
she
would
have
carried
a
baby
and
enter
to
kneel
before
a
tinselled
image
the
puppy
licking
her
face
affectionately
from
time
to
time
as
she
prayed
in
the
center
of
the
plaza
stands
a
fountain
topped
by
a
bronze
indian
a
figure
of
some
great
inca
no
indeed
but
a
north
american
redskin
feathers
in
buckskins
unandean
haughtiness
and
all
armed
with
such
a
bow
and
arrows
as
no
inca
ever
beheld
the
exotic
is
ever
more
pleasing
than
the
local
the
ornate
façade
of
la
compañía
testimonial
to
jesuit
wealth
in
colonial
days
stares
awry
at
the
cathedral
around
the
other
sides
of
the
square
are
the
usual
arched
and
pillared
arcades
gaudy
with
everything
that
appeals
to
the
eye
and
purse
of
the
peruvian
muleteer
here
are
gay
leather
knapsacks
in
which
to
carry
his
coca
and
less
valuable
possessions
richly
decorated
trappings
for
his
animals
or
fifes
to
while
away
the
weary
hours
across
the
unpeopled
páramos
and
the
with
earlaps
which
are
worn
not
only
by
babies
but
by
many
of
the
indians
of
surrounding
hamlets
the
clashing
of
shod
hoofs
sounds
now
and
then
over
the
cobbles
but
the
absence
of
vehicles
which
is
so
curious
a
feature
of
the
interior
cities
of
the
andes
would
be
striking
to
a
newcomer
a
ferrocarril
de
sangre
what
we
might
call
a
of
flesh
and
roofed
platform
on
wheels
behind
phlegmatic
down
to
the
station
on
memories
of
viceregal
times
hover
about
the
rare
that
serves
the
same
purpose
cuzco
had
no
electric
lights
as
yet
though
she
continued
to
hope
and
my
friend
martinelli
had
enstalled
a
dynamo
to
operate
his
cinema
in
the
patio
of
the
hotel
cuzco
was
the
first
place
in
south
america
with
any
hint
of
a
tourist
resort
about
it
visitors
have
become
almost
familiar
sights
and
there
was
already
developing
that
pest
of
european
unwashed
and
officious
urchins
offering
their
services
as
guides
an
occupation
undreamed
of
elsewhere
on
the
continent
a
wily
catalan
resident
pays
any
street
arab
twenty
cents
for
bringing
him
first
news
of
the
arrival
of
a
train
those
who
tramp
in
from
the
north
are
of
course
a
sporting
chance
on
recovering
the
from
the
possible
victim
but
the
business
is
still
in
embryo
though
there
are
those
who
prophesy
that
cuzco
will
some
day
become
the
rome
of
south
entirely
to
its
own
advantage
there
are
many
points
of
similarity
between
cuzco
and
quito
located
at
opposite
ends
of
what
is
left
of
the
ancient
inca
highway
in
climate
they
are
much
alike
being
feet
above
the
sea
and
on
the
thirteenth
parallel
south
surrounded
by
high
and
snowy
mountains
even
though
at
some
distance
one
would
expect
the
former
capital
of
tavantinsuyo
to
be
colder
but
even
in
this
rainy
season
though
the
atmosphere
was
often
from
the
almost
constant
downpour
it
was
only
more
dreary
not
lower
in
temperature
neither
of
the
two
cities
has
a
river
worthy
the
name
the
machángara
and
the
huatenay
with
their
slight
branches
serve
alike
as
and
equally
break
the
soil
with
deep
quebradas
splendid
views
of
both
cities
may
be
had
from
the
mountains
that
shut
them
in
though
in
this
respect
quito
surpasses
the
soft
evening
air
the
singing
of
birds
the
rows
of
tall
eucalyptus
trees
behind
massive
mud
walls
the
long
roads
to
the
railway
stations
are
alike
characteristic
of
the
two
towns
in
both
an
atrocious
din
of
tortures
the
hours
before
dawn
though
here
again
the
ecuadorian
capital
wins
the
palm
nor
can
the
cuzqueño
policeman
rival
his
fellow
of
the
equator
in
shrilling
away
the
monotonous
hours
of
darkness
to
nearly
as
great
an
extent
as
in
quito
the
patios
and
lower
stories
are
given
over
to
indians
and
servants
with
the
gente
decente
holding
the
upper
floor
both
towns
are
colorful
in
garb
both
are
peerless
when
the
sun
shines
and
gloomy
under
clouds
both
have
the
drowsy
air
of
places
far
removed
from
the
real
world
with
many
times
the
number
of
shops
needed
droning
through
a
precarious
existence
on
the
other
hand
whereas
the
indians
of
quito
speak
spanish
also
here
one
must
know
quichua
to
carry
on
any
extended
intercourse
there
are
a
few
beautiful
women
in
quito
too
i
never
saw
one
in
cuzco
though
this
may
be
merely
another
instance
of
my
abominable
luck
some
indian
girls
between
five
and
fifteen
are
pretty
but
they
are
so
often
veiled
by
the
grime
of
years
that
the
virtue
must
be
chiefly
accepted
on
faith
nor
has
cuzco
anything
approaching
that
unrivalled
circle
of
peaks
that
ennobles
the
vista
of
its
rival
to
the
north
the
two
cities
would
probably
be
about
equal
in
population
were
cuzco
also
the
national
it
should
and
hopes
some
day
to
be
we
want
to
free
ourselves
from
those
degenerate
negroes
of
lima
and
establish
an
independent
government
under
an
american
protectorate
a
lineal
descendant
of
the
incas
by
way
of
tupac
amaru
confided
to
me
as
it
is
quito
is
more
than
three
times
the
larger
cuzco
has
been
called
the
dirtiest
city
on
earth
i
am
not
sure
it
merits
the
title
the
andean
town
that
aspires
to
that
proud
and
haughty
position
will
have
to
exert
itself
cuzqueño
always
on
the
alert
for
new
and
hitherto
uninvented
styles
of
uncleanliness
for
it
will
have
dogged
unrelenting
competition
vastly
more
determined
and
energetic
than
any
other
form
of
industry
quito
for
instance
is
a
formidable
rival
in
this
also
especially
as
cuzco
has
the
handicap
of
a
much
smaller
in
a
contest
of
this
kind
every
little
one
helps
but
though
it
is
too
early
to
prophesy
the
final
rating
there
is
little
doubt
that
the
former
inca
capital
will
at
least
win
honorable
she
continues
to
import
american
alcaldes
which
brings
me
to
the
chief
influence
in
modern
cuzco
among
the
legends
of
the
origin
of
the
inca
empire
is
the
tradition
of
a
tall
imperious
man
of
white
skin
with
blond
hair
on
both
head
and
cheeks
who
arose
from
the
sea
and
took
up
the
task
of
teaching
the
children
of
the
sun
more
proper
ways
of
living
he
was
called
ingasman
whence
some
have
held
that
he
was
a
castaway
briton
from
some
ship
blown
to
these
distant
shores
long
before
the
days
of
columbus
a
fantastic
yarn
yet
is
it
impossible
the
imagination
likes
to
dwell
on
the
possibility
of
the
improbable
story
such
an
origin
might
account
for
the
stolid
british
temperament
of
the
indians
of
the
andes
as
to
complexion
leave
an
englishman
in
the
tropics
for
generations
and
the
result
would
be
no
darker
than
the
lineal
descendant
of
tupac
amaru
above
mentioned
whatever
the
truth
of
the
legend
the
modern
teacher
of
the
children
of
the
sun
came
from
the
sea
also
enthusiastic
hopeful
young
american
who
is
officially
rector
of
the
university
but
who
as
town
councilor
and
even
mayor
has
been
responsible
for
most
of
the
local
improvements
of
recent
years
for
all
the
labors
of
ingasman
the
town
was
probably
not
noted
for
its
immaculateness
before
the
conquest
it
is
of
that
stagnant
temperament
that
can
be
set
in
motion
only
by
some
external
force
thus
we
have
the
anomaly
of
seeing
that
picturesqueness
so
often
closely
allied
to
uncleanliness
which
americans
travel
to
cuzco
to
see
being
constantly
reduced
by
one
of
their
own
race
yet
the
influence
of
a
single
individual
however
energetic
is
limited
hence
one
must
still
be
circumspect
in
inspecting
old
walls
and
inca
ruins
and
the
wise
man
always
boils
his
water
on
the
banks
of
the
stinking
huatenay
of
the
old
inca
race
there
remain
few
traces
the
vast
majority
of
the
cuzqueños
are
descendants
of
the
incas
only
in
the
loose
acceptance
of
that
phrase
for
want
of
a
proper
name
the
people
of
tavantinsuyo
the
four
corners
of
the
earth
have
come
to
be
called
incas
as
the
inhabitants
of
the
united
states
are
called
americans
for
lack
of
a
national
adjective
as
a
matter
of
fact
an
was
a
member
of
the
royal
family
of
which
the
was
the
ruling
chief
it
is
easy
to
imagine
other
peoples
quarreling
with
the
race
over
their
their
supreme
indifference
protesting
that
they
too
inhabited
the
four
corners
of
the
earth
with
the
same
right
to
the
term
as
the
tribes
of
cuzco
and
referring
to
the
latter
privately
by
something
corresponding
to
yanqui
or
the
thick
upper
lip
wide
nostrils
and
broad
face
of
the
aboriginal
race
shows
in
some
degree
in
all
but
a
few
cuzqueños
those
of
full
indian
blood
still
make
up
a
large
percentage
of
the
population
the
cuzco
indian
is
a
type
by
himself
his
skin
is
darker
his
manner
more
cringing
his
gait
more
slinking
than
his
fellows
elsewhere
the
faces
of
both
males
and
females
have
a
brutalized
expression
that
seems
to
mark
them
as
the
most
degenerate
of
all
the
andean
tribes
rumor
has
it
that
they
retain
some
slight
and
sadly
mixed
traditions
of
huayna
ccápac
and
of
the
days
when
the
native
empire
occupied
this
vast
plateau
but
they
are
extremely
chary
of
sharing
any
information
they
may
possess
the
inca
rule
of
having
distinguishing
costumes
for
each
community
still
holds
especially
in
the
matter
of
and
it
is
as
easy
for
the
initiated
to
recognize
the
birthplace
of
an
indian
by
his
garments
as
to
know
a
hindu
s
caste
from
his
turban
many
from
the
towns
surrounding
cuzco
wear
knitted
tasseled
caps
of
gay
colors
with
earlaps
those
of
the
city
are
noted
for
their
pancake
hats
common
to
both
sexes
these
are
round
disks
of
straw
covered
with
flannel
or
an
imitation
of
velveteen
one
side
of
faded
black
with
stripes
of
color
or
gilt
braid
the
other
brilliant
or
dull
red
according
to
its
age
which
is
generally
advanced
in
fine
weather
this
is
worn
black
side
up
in
wet
it
is
reversed
the
women
are
invariably
barefoot
the
men
usually
so
or
with
at
most
a
strip
of
leather
to
protect
their
soles
except
that
old
men
who
have
once
wielded
the
cane
of
authority
over
their
section
of
the
community
uphold
their
dignity
by
wearing
on
sundays
and
heavy
native
shoes
often
with
large
buckles
and
always
without
socks
the
women
wear
carelessly
fastened
blouses
of
coarse
material
heavy
skirts
bunched
about
their
waists
and
a
shawl
fastened
with
one
pin
of
large
fanciful
head
the
men
dress
in
tight
ragged
or
loose
shoddy
trousers
of
varying
lengths
and
ponchos
which
prove
that
full
use
is
made
of
the
little
packages
of
crude
aniline
dyes
sold
in
the
the
quiet
of
this
chief
is
unusual
it
has
no
clatter
but
only
a
suppressed
hum
for
the
indian
of
cuzco
is
as
silent
as
he
is
inoffensive
here
huge
strawberries
are
sold
at
cents
a
hundred
the
female
vendors
counting
them
out
by
tens
in
hissing
quichua
sibilants
the
hot
country
is
only
a
day
s
tramp
from
cuzco
hence
tropical
as
well
as
temperate
fruits
are
displayed
though
often
sadly
crushed
and
maltreated
by
their
transportation
in
sacks
or
nets
on
human
backs
the
indians
are
here
the
same
beasts
of
burden
as
elsewhere
in
the
andes
it
is
no
uncommon
thing
to
see
a
rather
small
man
trot
the
mile
from
market
to
railway
station
with
half
a
beef
on
his
back
the
of
the
aboriginal
as
well
as
his
lack
of
strength
for
any
labor
except
carrying
is
often
in
evidence
i
saw
one
ordered
to
take
an
iron
wheelbarrow
to
another
part
of
town
he
removed
the
wheel
and
bound
it
on
his
wife
s
back
with
a
rope
slung
the
rest
on
his
own
shoulders
in
the
same
manner
and
away
they
trotted
one
behind
the
other
when
all
is
said
and
done
the
andean
indian
remains
an
enigma
to
the
foreigner
at
the
end
of
a
year
of
constant
intercourse
with
him
the
traveler
can
quickly
sum
up
his
real
knowledge
of
a
race
whose
internal
workings
he
has
only
guessed
confessing
an
inability
to
see
from
the
aboriginal
s
point
of
view
to
be
aware
with
his
consciousness
there
is
an
enormous
difference
between
the
south
american
indian
and
the
bearers
of
the
same
misnomer
in
our
own
country
the
majority
of
our
tribes
were
warriors
with
an
obstinate
courage
that
took
little
account
of
odds
they
could
be
killed
they
could
never
be
enslaved
to
a
degree
that
made
them
profitable
servants
from
tehuantepec
southward
on
the
other
hand
the
aboriginals
are
noted
for
a
subservience
not
to
say
timidity
that
made
it
possible
for
the
spaniards
to
exploit
them
ruthlessly
as
do
their
descendants
to
this
day
was
this
characteristic
the
result
or
the
cause
of
the
government
under
which
the
conquistadores
found
them
ruled
by
the
incas
in
a
far
more
autocratic
form
of
imperialism
than
the
worst
known
carrying
authority
into
the
very
depths
of
their
cabins
and
the
most
personal
conduct
of
their
lives
the
indians
of
the
andes
were
robbed
of
all
that
they
ever
possessed
became
the
most
passive
of
human
creatures
having
imbued
their
subjects
with
a
sort
of
fatalism
a
to
anything
they
conceived
as
authority
above
all
by
convincing
them
of
their
own
divine
origin
the
incas
made
their
conquest
by
the
spaniards
easy
for
the
credulous
masses
readily
accepted
these
bearded
strangers
as
children
of
the
sun
also
to
whom
any
resistance
would
be
absurd
thus
must
all
false
doctrines
prove
in
time
a
boomerang
to
those
who
foster
them

woman
of
abancay
who
refused
to
run
the
risk
of
having
the
infant

assured
that
it
was
the

wearing
the
which
all
put
on
at
the
age
of
puberty
and
in
which
the

carried
when
one
arrives
the
domination
once
held
by
the
incas
has
been
taken
over
by
the
priests
public
functionaries
and
the
whose
wills
are
obeyed
without
question
in
the
eyes
of
the
indian
the
priest
is
the
representative
of
god
on
earth
to
whom
he
must
show
absolute
submission
and
obedience
as
to
one
who
holds
the
key
to
that
place
of
primitive
joys
and
freedom
from
the
sorrows
and
hardships
of
this
world
to
which
he
conceives
death
to
lead
that
the
priest
may
be
harsh
and
unkindly
or
worse
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
even
the
god
of
his
conception
is
cruel
and
vengeful
taking
pleasure
in
bringing
down
misfortunes
on
his
head
and
to
be
placated
by
any
means
in
his
power
were
priest
and
authorities
true
to
their
missions
their
domination
over
the
indian
might
be
advantageous
too
often
they
are
quite
the
contrary
the
authorities
are
disdainful
looking
upon
their
positions
merely
as
opportunities
for
personal
gain
the
priest
is
less
often
a
shepherd
than
a
wolf
preying
upon
his
flock
with
impunity
too
often
priest
and
authorities
join
together
to
exploit
the
aboriginal
with
liquor
and
church
festivals
his
only
recreations
at
times
even
inventing
the
latter
to
make
an
excuse
for
exploitation
whatever
he
may
once
have
been
the
indian
of
the
cordillera
is
a
child
to
be
governed
by
a
kindly
father
as
the
incas
seem
to
some
extent
to
have
been
the
civilization
which
the
spaniard
is
reputed
to
have
brought
him
is
nothing
of
the
sort
garsilaso
assures
us
that
the
masses
were
little
better
than
domestic
animals
even
at
the
time
of
the
conquest
they
were
certainly
in
no
worse
state
than
that
he
should
have
remained
or
fallen
so
low
is
difficult
for
us
of
the
hopeful
united
states
to
understand
it
would
be
more
easily
understood
in
india
with
its
fixed
castes
or
even
in
england
where
certain
boys
are
born
with
the
necessity
of
lifting
their
caps
to
certain
other
boys
his
stolidity
passes
all
conception
he
is
native
to
and
of
a
piece
with
the
pampa
the
bare
treeless
upland
world
where
the
dreary
expanse
of
brown
earth
and
cold
blue
sky
incites
neither
ambition
nor
friendliness
neither
hopes
nor
aspirations
hence
his
flat
joyless
face
with
its
furtive
eyes
suggests
a
soul
contracted
upon
itself
an
aridity
of
sentiments
an
absolute
lack
of
aesthetic
affections
passively
sullen
morose
and
uncommunicative
he
neither
desires
nor
aspires
and
loves
or
abhors
with
moderation
the
native
language
is
scanty
and
cold
in
terms
of
endearment
i
have
never
seen
the
faintest
demonstration
of
affection
between
indians
of
the
two
sexes
though
plenty
of
evidence
of
bestial
lust
even
his
music
is
a
monotonous
wailing
an
interminable
sob
on
a
minor
key
he
lacks
perseverance
confidence
either
in
himself
or
others
and
has
a
profound
abhorrence
of
any
ways
that
are
not
his
ways
he
works
best
in
bees
with
the
beating
of
a
drum
the
wail
of
a
quena
and
frequent
libations
of
chicha
to
cheer
him
on
as
no
doubt
in
the
days
of
the
incas
he
is
noted
for
endurance
yet
this
is
not
so
great
as
is
commonly
fancied
like
an
animal
he
can
not
go
on
his
nerve
or
will
not
which
amounts
to
the
same
thing
try
to
hurry
him
and
it
will
be
found
that
he
needs
fifteen
days
rest
each
month
like
the
llama
from
his
earliest
years
the
andean
indian
forms
a
conception
of
life
as
something
sinister
and
painful
as
a
baby
as
soon
as
another
uncomplaining
little
creature
usurps
his
place
on
the
maternal
back
he
is
shut
up
in
some
noisome
patio
or
hut
along
with
chickens
and
sheep
with
which
he
fights
for
his
scanty
fare
of
a
handful
of
toasted
corn
rolling
about
in
his
own
filth
and
that
of
the
animals
who
now
and
again
all
but
outdo
him
in
combat
he
reaches
the
age
of
four
or
five
and
then
begins
his
struggle
with
hostile
nature
in
the
country

to
this
that

was
forbidden
the

it

the

by

lives
for

on

knowing
that
if

he
will
some
day
come

the

he
has
an
irrepressible
love
for
his
native
spot
the
mud

where
he
was
born
however
miserable
or
inclement
and
will
not
abandon
his
home
permanently
under
any
circumstances
if
he
does
not
return
it
is
because
some
misfortune
has
overtaken
him
on
the
trail
the
woman
lives
the
same
life
from
babyhood
and
in
some
ways
her
duties
are
still
more
onerous
rude
and
torpid

the

neither
conceives
nor
possesses
any
of
those
softer

suffers

at
an
utter
stranger

in
either
its
passive
or
active
form
strong
as
a
she
knows
none
of
the
infirmities
to
which
modern
civilized
woman
is
subject
she
gives
birth
to
a
child
virtually
every
year
often
from
the
age
of
fifteen
on
without
any
species
of
preparation
or
precaution
washes
it
in
the
nearest
brook
slings
it
on
her
back
and
goes
on
about
her
business
the
husbandman
of
the
puna
plants
a
few
potatoes
a
little
quinoa
perhaps
some
barley
clinging
to
the
primitive
ways
of
his
ancestors
to
remote
generations
a
good
harvest
does
not
depend
upon
proper
planting
or
fertilization
but
on
the
changes
of
the
moon
and
stars
and
the
propitiation
of
the
fetishes
to
which
he
still
secretly
gives
his
adherence
in
spite
of
his
ostensible
conversion
to
christianity
he
considers
himself
a
being
apart
from
the
governing
class
referring
to
himself
as
gente
natural
and
to
his
superiors
as
gente
blanca
as
our
southern
negroes
distinguish
between
white
folks
and
colored
he
takes
no
part
whatever
in
political
matters
rarely
indeed
having
any
conception
of
the
country
to
which
he
belongs
anything
which
does
not
touch
him
personally
he
looks
upon
with
profound
indifference
and
disdain
he
is
submissive
as
a
brute
lives
without
enthusiasms
without
ambitions
in
a
purely
animal
passivity
that
is
the
despair
of
those
who
are
moved
to
an
attempt
to
better
his
lot
some
knowledge
of
quichua
is
essential
to
intercourse
with
the
mass
of
the
population
of
cuzco
as
it
is
to
the
convenience
of
the
lone
traveler
down
the
andes
even
in
the
city
a
large
number
of
the
gente
del
pueblo
can
not
or
will
not
speak
spanish
in
the
villages
round
about
it
is
a
rare
man
who
has
a
suggestion
of
castilian
all
classes
on
the
other
hand
speak
the
aboriginal
tongue
by
necessity
if
not
by
choice
the
majority
indeed
imbibe
it
with
their
nurse
s
milk
learning
spanish
as
an
alien
language
later
in
life
a
professor
of
the
local
university
boasting
a
assured
me
that
he
did
not
know
a
word
of
castilian
when
he
first
entered
school
at
the
age
of
seven
after
the
revolt
of
tupac
amaru
an
edict
was
promulgated
prohibiting
the
use
of
quichua
as
it
did
the
native
costume
and
even
commanded
that
all
musical
instruments
of
the
aboriginals
be
destroyed
but
like
many
a
law
this
was
never
strictly
enforced
cuzco
is
the
florence
of
quichua
where
it
has
retained
its
purest
form
least
influenced
by
the
spanish
and
there
are
many
persons
of
high
social
standing
the
women
especially
who
speak
it
by
preference
it
is
typical
of
the
that
those
things
which
are
of
the
soil
and
have
been
familiar
since
childhood
are
treated
with
contempt
are
considered
inferior
to
anything
possessing
the
glamor
of
distance
thus
quichua
like
all
survivals
of
los
géntiles
is
looked
down
upon
by
the
cultured
caste
throughout
the
andes
as
something
appertaining
to
the
lower
classes
to
be
avoided
as
diligently
as
manual
labor
vulgarly
speaking
is
the
expression
with
which
the
peruvian
apologetically
prefaces
any
use
of
the
native
tongue
no
se
dice
se
dice
a
mother
reproves
the
child
that
points
to
a
dog
with
a
lisp
of
the
aboriginal
word
but
as
usual
environment
is
more
powerful
than
maternal
desires
and
the
child
grows
more
fluent
in
the
speech
of
the
indians
than
in
the
aristocratic
spanish
the
tendency
to
scorn
it
seems
a
pity
to
the
traveler
for
the
ancient
tongue
is
certainly
worth
preserving
and
its
preservation
depends
chiefly
on
cuzco
the
american
rector
of
the
university
has
done
much
to
reassure
the
town
on
the
importance
of
its
mission
in
this
respect
already
much
has
been
lost
the
best
quichuaist
in
town
did
not
know
the
words
for
boat
or
island
though
these
are
familiar
enough
wherever
any
body
of
water
exists
in
the
andes
shortly
before
my
arrival
the
ancient
drama
ollantay
had
been
performed
and
was
found
to
contain
many
words
which
even
those
whose
is
quichua
did
not
understand
as
the
or
knotted
strings
was
the
only
form
of
writing
known
to
the
incas
authoritative
interpretation
has
been
lost
with
the
who
were
trained
to
read
them
the
tongue
of
has
suffered
much
admixture
many
spanish
words
having
been
quichuaized
when
there
was
no
necessity
for
it
until
there
remains
a
language
as
bastardized
as
the
german
of
rural
pennsylvania
not
a
few
have
a
distinctly
hazy
notion
of
the
line
between
the
two
tongues
medio

alejandro
my

which

which
of
the
two
languages
he
had
spoken
from
childhood
neither
of
which
he
could
read
nor
write
there
is
less
excuse
for
the
assurance
of
persons
of
some
education
that
asno

quichua

overlooking
the
fact
that

and
looking
down
upon
the
city
of
the

murmur
oh

it
requires
at
least
three
persons
to
shoe
a
horse

mule
as
it
does
to
milk
a
cow
in

one
of
the
many
old

the
modern

are
superimposed

after
all
the
ancient
tongue
of
the
incas
variously
called
quichua
quechua
and
keshua
with
the
most
guttural
of
sounds
has
survived
to
a
greater
extent
than
any
other
american
dialect
some
have
called
it
runa
simi
or
general
language
of
the
common
people
but
the
quichuaists
of
cuzco
insist
that
it
is
rather
the
inca
or
court
language
that
has
remained
garsilaso
complained
that
even
in
the
time
of
the
incas
there
was
a
confusion
and
multitude
of
tongues
with
a
new
dialect
almost
every
league
he
who
has
attempted
to
make
his
way
down
the
andes
on
a
fixed
vocabulary
will
recognize
the
justice
of
this
plaint
before
we
left
panama
hays
and
i
had
made
up
a
lexicon
only
to
find
that
all
but
the
commonest
words
changed
so
often
that
it
was
of
little
value
what
is
called
quichua
is
spoken
more
or
less
continuously
from
quito
to
southern
bolivia
with
scatterings
through
northern
argentine
but
the
dialects
of
ayacucho
huancayo
the
valley
of
ancachs
and
especially
of
cajamaca
and
further
north
include
many
terms
which
the
purists
of
cuzco
will
not
grant
an
honest
pedigree
only
in
the
ancient
capital
has
it
retained
anything
like
the
original
pronunciation
with
those
sounds
harsh
and
disagreeable
to
our
ears
which
garsilaso
sought
to
soften
with
editorial
license
philologists
assure
us
that
the
language
rose
in
the
north
and
moved
southward
citing
the
use
of
more
archaic
terms
in
the
more
southern
dialects
for
example
which
is
water
in
the
north
is
flowing
water
or
river
in
the
south
where
designates
the
liquid
the
spread
of
quichua
has
been
attributed
to
culture
rather
than
conquest
that
is
it
was
adopted
by
new
tribes
coming
under
the
inca
influence
not
because
it
was
forced
upon
them
but
because
it
afforded
a
more
perfect
means
of
communication
than
their
primitive
dialects
it
is
a
real
language
with
complete
grammar
and
all
the
flexibility
and
shades
of
expression
of
our
classical
tongues
philologists
have
attempted
in
vain
to
represent
its
sounds
by
roman
letters
or
combinations
thereof
even
by
inventing
new
characters
but
these
are
makeshifts
at
best
and
the
pronunciation
can
only
be
learned
by
practice
in
its
native
land
roughly
speaking
it
includes
all
the
letters
of
the
spanish
alphabet
except
b
d
f
g
j
v
x
and
z
but
many
of
those
remaining
must
be
doubled
or
otherwise
modified
to
represent
sounds
unknown
to
european
tongues
l
is
rare
while
the
sound
represented
by
the
spanish
ll
is
frequent
there
is
no
rr
but
r
is
much
used
harsh
in
its
phonetics
it
has
a
suggestion
of
the
chinese
in
that
three
pronunciations
of
the
same
word
labial
palatal
or
throaty
give
it
quite
different
meanings
the
traveler
who
pauses
in
the
trail
to
call
out
cancha
acca
to
an
indian
hut
displaying
the
white
flag
that
announces
chicha
for
sale
would
say
something
quite
different
than
he
intended
if
he
gave
the
cc
the
sound
represented
by
the
single
the
accent
is
nearly
always
on
the
penult
lending
the
speech
a
fixed
and
almost
monotonous
rhythm
technically
speaking
quichua
is
agglutinative
that
is
formed
by
the
tacking
on
of
suffix
after
suffix
until
in
some
cases
an
entire
sentence
consists
of
a
single
word
making
it
possible
to
express
fine
shades
of
meaning
fully
equal
to
the
spanish
with
its
diminutives
and
affixes
it
has
no
articles
no
genders
at
least
expressed
no
individual
prepositions
and
has
virtually
only
one
verb
conjugation
the
plural
is
formed
by
adding
the
six
cases
corresponding
to
the
latin
by
suffixes
thus
is
boy
boys
is
the
accusative
of
the
boys
in
like
manner
the
genitive
is
formed
by
combination
is
chicha
house
and
tavern
the
doubling
of
words
gives
a
collective
and
often
quite
different
meaning
thus
is
stone
a
stony
place
is
man
a
crowd
is
bark
the
medicinal
bark
from
which
we
get
quinine
as
well
as
the
name
thereof
its
system
of
counting
is
built
up
on
the
fingers
as
in
all
languages
but
is
somewhat
cumbersome
in
larger
none
of
the
ignorant
indians
of
are
capable
of
using
thus
is
as
in
the
case
of
all
more
or
less
primitive
languages
quichua
is
often
onomatopoetic
words
formed
from
sounds
connected
with
the
object
expressed
why
the
animal
we
miscall
should
be
kwee
to
the
natives
of
the
andes
no
one
who
has
shivered
through
a
night
in
an
indian
hut
listening
to
the
falsetto
grunting
squeak
of
those
irrepressible
little
creatures
will
wonder
why
a
baby
is
a
wawa
none
need
ask
as
in
most
languages
is
mother
on
the
other
hand
father
is
or
the
newcomer
finds
already
in
use
to
designate
potato
as
it
has
come
to
in
all
as
well
as
in
andalusia
the
primitive
origin
of
the
inca
tongue
is
further
demonstrated
by
many
crudities
of
expression
and
an
indelicacy
in
the
use
of
certain
terms
that
have
been
banished
from
polite
intercourse
among
european
nations
or
shame
are
cases
in
point
is
literally
the
time
to
chase
a
it
is
natural
that
many
more
aboriginal
words
should
have
survived
and
become
a
part
of
the
general
language
in
a
land
where
the
indians
have
survived
themselves
than
in
one
where
the
race
has
been
virtually
wiped
out
or
at
least
set
apart
as
with
us
hence
the
language
of
is
much
richer
than
our
own
in
terms
from
the
aboriginal
tongue
the
ignorant
spanish
conquistadores
as
devoid
of
language
sense
as
the
most
uncouth
american
drummer
gave
many
of
the
native
words
queer
twists
to
their
untrained
ears
sounded
like
andes
like
tambo
like
bamba
and
like
peru
yet
quichua
has
enriched
even
the
languages
of
the
world
at
large
with
many
words
such
as
llama
pampa
condor
and
alpaca
a
brief
sample
of
the
ancient
tongue
might
not
be
amiss
few
works
except
the
bible
have
been
printed
in
the
vernacular
and
this
was
done
not
that
the
indians
might
read
it
since
there
probably
exists
no
man
able
to
read
quichua
who
can
not
also
read
spanish
but
for
the
use
of
missionaries
and
priests
among
the
andean
tribes
many
words
for
which
there
existed
no
equivalent
have
of
course
been
quichuaized
and

letters

their

values

this
hotbed
of
fanaticism
the
prefect
does
not
interpret
his
duties
too
severely
with
a
din
that
awoke
the
echoes
of
the
distant
that
shut
her
in
cuzco
sallied
frequently
forth
in
a
long
religious
procession
not
a
single
white
man
gracing
it
except
the
priests
these
latter
did
not
permit
the
most
solemn
formalities
to
weigh
heavily
upon
them
even
within
the
cathedral
itself
i
have
seen
the
chief
padre
carrying
the
host
or
whatever
it
is
and
marching
with
sanctimonious
tread
under
his
embroidered
canopy
wrinkle
up
his
lascivious
countenance
and
make
unbelievably
scurrilous
jokes
with
the
priests
close
around
him
about
the
attractive
girls
of
the
pious
downcast
audience
peru
has
long
been
one
of
the
most
intolerant
of
nations
at
least
theoretically
since
the
adoption
of
her
constitution
public
worship
by
has
been
forbidden
its
fourth
article
reading
the
nation
professes
the
catholic
religion
apostolic
and
roman
the
state
protects
it
and
does
not
permit
the
public
exercise
of
any
an
attempt
had
recently
been
made
to
amend
this
to
the
extent
of
striking
out
the
last
clause
there
has
long
been
violation
of
the
law
lima
has
an
episcopal
church
of
long
standing
and
considerable
congregation
and
as
the
membership
is
largely
english
and
american
peru
has
not
risked
a
controversy
with
those
countries
by
enforcing
the
constitution
in
fact
the
strongest
and
chief
argument
of
the
senators
supporting
the
proposed
amendment
was
not
that
liberty
of
cult
is
just
but
that
the
law
is
not
being
enforced
anyway
so
let
s
change
a
very
few
grasped
the
fact
that
this
is
one
of
the
many
reforms
needed
to
draw
to
peru
the
immigration
indispensable
to
her
modern
advancement
the
arguments
of
the
hidebound
clerical
senators
against
the
proposed
change
afforded
reading
compared
to
which
the
efforts
of
the
world
s
chief
humorists
are
staid
and
funereal
great
excitement
broke
out
in
the
more
conservative
cities
of
the
interior
when
the
news
came
up
from
lima
headed
by
the
archbishop
ecclesiastics
of
every
grade
issued
orders
to
all
to
combat
por
cualquier
any
means
whatever
this
vile
attack
on
the
holy
mother
church
the
morality
of
the
family
and
the
honor
of
peru
by
the
and
of
the
from
all
the
telegrams
poured
in
calling
upon
the
senators
to
suppress
this
absurd
resolution
on
the
liberty
of
cults
unnatural
to
peru
and
abhorred
by
all
the
every
scurrilous
little
catholic
the
most
outspoken
journal
of
our
southwest
can
not
approach
these
in
vituperation
and
positive
indecency
of
language
in
attacking
their
with
raging
editorials
in
cuzco
it
was
planned
to
parade
the
patron
saint
through
the
streets
ostensibly
as
a
mere
protest
a
few
years
ago
the
bishop
would
have
met
the
issue
by
calling
together
a
few
hundred
of
the
most
fanatical
filling
them
with
concentrated
courage
and
preaching
a
careful
sermon
that
would
really
have
been
an
order
to
sack
and
kill
the
hated
liberals
though
with
a
clever
wording
to
clear
his
own
skirts
of
the
matter
such
things
have
often
happened
in
cuzco
this
time
a
rumor
that
the
procession
was
to
be
merely
an
excuse
for
the
priests
to
incite
their
followers
of
dull
complexion
and
understanding
to
riot
reached
the
students
of
the
university
though
all
are
catholics
these
fiery
liberals
are
ardent
haters
of
priests
only
a
few
years
before
they
had
bodily
flung
the
clerical
faculty
out
of
the
institution
now
they
secretly
gathered
revolvers
and
planned
to
lay
in
wait
for
some
of
the
more
fanatical
priests
when
the
procession
started
wind
of
this
reached
some
one
of
higher
authority
and
intelligence
the
news
was
wired
to
lima
and
in
the
nick
of
time
orders
came
to
the
prefect
to
forbid
the
parade
an
amendment
to
the
constitution
in
peru
requires
the
consent
of
two
consecutive
congresses
and
the
signature
of
the
president
after
each
passage
a
year
later
the
amendment
on
the
liberty
of
cult
was
carried
and
became
law
amid
a
scene
of
riot
in
the
senate
during
which
a
fanatical
representative
snatched
the
bill
from
the
hands
of
a
clerk
and
tore
it
to
bits
it
occurred
to
me
one
day
that
it
might
be
unpatriotic
to
leave
cuzco
without
calling
on
the
only
american
a
lone
preacher
in
had
so
far
heard
of
in
south
america
on
the
edge
of
town
i
found
my
way
at
length
into
a
compound
of
some
fifteen
acres
with
fat
green
alfalfa
an
exotic
windmill
and
a
mansion
surrounded
by
i
had
paused
near
what
seemed
to
be
the
main
door
and
stood
gazing
admiringly
at
the
wall
that
shut
out
all
the
troubles
of
this
rude
world
when
a
window
opened
and
a
lean
man
of
forty
his
mission
plainly
imprinted
on
his
gaunt
features
a
finger
between
the
leaves
of
a
put
out
his
head
and
murmured
buenas
is
this
i
asked
in
english
it
well
i
just
happened
to
be
in
town
and
thought
i
d
but
no
doubt
you
are
very
busy
yes
i
am
busy
came
the
reply
in
a
bona
fide
missionary
voice
but
don
t
let
that
keep
you
from
coming
you
want
naturally
i
grasped
so
urgent
an
invitation
with
both
hands
oh
no
i
protested
i
wouldn
t
think
of
disturbing
you
i
ll
stay
out
here
and
look
at
the
yes
look
at
the
scenery
replied
the
urgent
gentleman
as
he
and
the
disappeared
behind
the
closed
window
inside
arose
sounds
not
unlike
a
methodist
meeting
and
i
had
begun
to
wander
stealthily
away
when
the
door
opened
and
the
missionary
s
more
cordial
better
half
informed
me
that
they
were
not
holding
reassured
i
entered
the
cozy
parlor
two
women
and
a
man
were
gathered
about
a
diminutive
melodeon
singing
mournful
hymns
naturally
at
sight
of
me
the
musicians
lost
their
nerve
and
the
cheerful
pastime
came
to
a
standstill
in
due
time
i
discovered
that
the
youthful
organist
had
just
been
shipped
down
fresh
and
untarnished
from
a
canadian
theological
seminary
to
bring
the
poor
peruvians
to
his
qualifications
for
that
feat
were
that
he
had
not
up
to
his
arrival
seen
a
printed
page
of
spanish
had
never
heard
of
quichua
or
pizarro
and
though
he
did
remember
the
name
prescott
he
didn
t
know
he
had
written
about
foreign
i
found
that
peyrounel
he
of
the
maidenly
hair
chestful
of
medals
and
andarín
reputation
had
lived
a
month
at
the
mission
the
year
before
having
posed
as
a
poor
persecuted
huguenot
among
bloodthirsty
catholics
he
had
filled
the
scanty
imaginations
of
the
group
with
so
many
wild
tales
of
the
road
that
i
could
not
refrain
from
giving
my
own
inventiveness
vent
and
at
the
end
of
a
dozen
bloodcurdling
episodes
the
fresh
young
product
of
the
seminary
remarked
in
a
ladylike
voice
that
must
have
been
quite
looked
at
from
that
point
of
view
perhaps
he
was
right
in
the
early
days
of
their
mission
the
ladies
had
been
received
and
called
on
socially
by
the
haughtiest
of
their
sex
in
cuzco
but
they
had
soon
been
ostracized
not
because
of
their
from
the
cuzco
point
of
view
lack
because
having
been
detected
in
the
act
of
sweeping
out
their
own
parlor
it
was
concluded
that
they
were
in
their
own
country
and
not
fit
to
associate
with
gente
decente
unless
the
time
of
my
stay
there
was
exceptional
suicide
is
à
la
mode
in
cuzco
almost
on
the
day
of
my
arrival
one
bold
youth
of
decided
to
die
because
señorita
fulana
scorned
his
attentions
he
wrote
a
long
poem
explaining
to
the
disdainful
damsel
and
the
world
at
large
why
he
was
leaving
life
so
afterward
graced
the
contribution
page
of
one
of
the
local
fired
four
revolver
shots
one
grazed
his
chest
a
second
tore
a
hole
in
the
tail
of
his
the
third
smashed
a
lamp
on
the
mantelpiece
and
the
fourth
scared
the
family
cat
off
the
divan
the
date
of
the
wedding
was
soon
to
be
announced
when
i
left
cuzco
among
the
host
of
disciples
of
this
heroic
and
enviable
deed
among
the
excitable
of
cuzco
were
several
youth
of
like
age
who
attempted
to
imitate
it
from
equally
absurd
motives
all
carried
the
act
to
a
more
or
less
successful
conclusion
except
one
who
either
because
he
took
the
matter
too
seriously
or
neglected
to
practice
beforehand
or
because
he
was
not
a
native
cuzqueño
or
had
been
reading
ibsen
shot
himself
through
the
temple
the
subject
of
suicide
leads
us
naturally
to
the
cemetery
that
of
cuzco
celebrated
a
sort
of
decoration
day
during
my
stay
placards
announced
that
for
reasons
of
hygiene
the
alcalde
permitted
no
one
but
actual
mourners
to
visit
it
but
it
is
always
easy
to
find
something
to
mourn
over
in
peru
an
endless
stream
of
humanity
was
pouring
in
through
the
gate
by
which
i
entered
while
a
score
of
soldiers
on
guard
stood
drinking
chicha
gambling
and
making
love
as
in
all
spanish
countries
the
corpses
were
away
bricked
in
and
marked
with
the
date
on
which
the
rent
would
fall
due
with
unlimited
space
about
the
city
it
is
hard
to
understand
why
the
dead
must
be
tucked
away
in
this
expensive
fashion
except
that
the
priests
refuse
to
sprinkle
with
holy
water
those
planted
elsewhere
at
the
gate
was
posted
a
long
list
of
corpses
whose
rent
had
run
out
with
the
information
that
unless
it
was
paid
by
the
end
of
the
month
the
contents
would
be
dumped
in
the
boneyard
a
visit
to
any
cemetery
is
equal
to
sitting
through
a
comedy
so
lacking
is
the
native
sense
of
propriety
between
the
padlocked
iron
reja
and
the
bulkhead
of
each
grave
is
a
narrow
space
which
it
is
à
la
mode
to
fill
with
flowers
but
as
flowerpots
are
rare
and
expensive
in
cuzco
there
were
substituted
cans
that
had
once
held
horiman
s
tea
or
smith
s
mixed
pickles
many
with
gay
labels
adorned
with
the
portraits
of
scantily
clad
actresses
of
international
notoriety
still
upon
them
here
and
there
a
family
with
a
praiseworthy
sense
of
economy
had
caused
the
to
be
marked
with
the
brass
that
formerly
graced
the
place
of
business
of
the
deceased
others
had
renewed
to
crudely
scratched
in
the
cement
bearing
witness
to
an
unusually
tenacious
grief
on
the
part
of
the
to
a
will
many
tombs
were
decorated
with
atrocious
photographs
of
the
occupant
others
had
doubt
the
author
would
call
them
printed
some
laboriously
pasted
against
them
and
glassed
over
like
the
photographs
here
and
there
the
bulkhead
of
a
member
of
society
was
entirely
covered
by
a
painting
depicting
the
untold
grief
of
those
left
behind
most
cases
a
picture
of
the
coffin
of
the
deceased
with
a
string
of
his
male
relatives
and
friends
on
one
side
and
the
female
mourners
opposite
all
dressed
in
their
most
correct
the
best
the
painter
could
furnish
them
from
his
standing
exact
distances
apart
in
exactly
the
same
attitude
of
weeping
copiously
into
a
large
handkerchief
á
dos
reales
in
any
shop
only
as
the
painter
who
is
seldom
a
direct
descendant
of
murillo
always
paints
in
the
eyes
the
handkerchief
the
impression
conveyed
is
that
the
entire
group
is
suffering
from
a
bad
cold
that
the
funeral
was
inadvertently
put
off
too
long
or
that
each
is
keeping
a
worldly
eye
out

any
suspicious
move

the
teacher
s
knowledge
of
his
subject
was
such
as
might
be
gathered
in
the
dormitories
of
that
seat
of
jesuitical
learning
above
mentioned
but
was
not
exactly
what
he
might
have
learned
had
he
been
permitted
to
mingle
with
the
profane
outside
world
it
would
not
have
been
so
bad
had
he
been
content
to
stick
to
his
cortina
grammar
though
his
pronunciation
was
at
best
but
like
so
many
persons
he
regarded
himself
as
the
source
of
all
wisdom
and
insisted
on
using
his
own
judgment
when
he
possessed
none
he
was
dictating
dialogues
between
two
american
boys
and
forcing
his
students
to
learn
to
them
just
such
expressions
as
we
have
all
no
doubt
heard
american
boys
use
to
each
other

not
even
the

virtue
of
being
true

up
the
jesuited
instructor
had
no
doubt
often
heard
this
hasty
word
in
the
dormitories
but
having
never
chanced
to
see
it
in
print
he
had
chosen
his
own
spelling
with
this
happy
result

now
shall
go
to
the

distressing

john
thank
you
what
are
the
news
several
students
made
the
error
of
using
a
singular
verb
in
this
sentence
but
they
were
quickly
and
sarcastically
reminded
that
the
noun
ends
in
an
s
which
any
fool
knows
is
a
sign
of
the
plural

in

the

and
so
on
always
with
a
distinctly
pronunciation
the
traveler
can
scarcely
blame
himself
if
he
does
not
understand
his
native
tongue
when
it
is
shouted
after
him
in
the
streets
of
cuzco
by
the
proud
students
of
the
colegio
the
higher
institution
is
the
ancient
university
of
cuzco
founded
nearly
a
before
our
oldest
and
occupying
the
great
stone
cloisters
of
the
former
jesuit
monastery
a
young
and
enthusiastic
american
rector
has
done
much
to
give
it
new
impulse
but
one
man
can
not
reform
the
character
its
students
from
the
four
surrounding
departments
have
increased
both
in
numbers
and
diligence
since
the
conservative
professors
were
thrown
out
but
their
point
of
view
is
still
not
exactly
that
of
our
own
college
men
among
others
i
attended
a
class
on
special
it
was
a
course
of
seven
students
the
hour
from
three
to
four
i
arrived
at
and
found
the
professor
a
cuzco
whose
wide
nostrils
broad
face
and
prominent
cheek
bones
proved
him
chiefly
of
aboriginal
blood
pacing
up
and
down
the
corredor
smoking
a
cigarette
at
a
white
youth
of
about
with
a
mustache
drifted
languidly
across
the
patio
swinging
his
cane
he
and
the
professor
bowed
low
shook
hands
exchanged
the
unavoidable
buenas
tardes
señor
cómo
está
usted
cómo
está
la
familia
lifted
their
hats
and
at
length
broke
the
clinch
the
professor
produced
from
his
pocket
a
massive
key
and
opened
a
cubical
whitewashed
room
having
installed
himself
in
which
he
began
to
lecture
on
calderón
de
la
barca
at
a
student
stamped
into
the
room
and
interrupted
the
proceedings
with
a
loud
buenas
tardes
señor
causing
the
professor
to
lose
the
thread
of
his
discourse
for
a
minute
or
more
when
the
interruption
had
subsided
he
continued
to
lecture
pausing
now
and
then
to
look
at
his
outline
notes
more
often
to
inhale
the
smoke
of
the
cigarette
he
still
held
backward
between
his
fingers
the
white
youth
soon
fell
asleep
woke
as
his
head
dropped
spat
on
the
floor
and
then
frankly
and
openly
laid
his
head
back
against
the
wall
and
slept
the
other
half
of
the
class
sat
with
the
filmy
eyes
of
a
man
who
is
dreaming
of
his
cholita
of
not
too
unobliging
morals
in
some
hut
on
the
outskirts
of
town
it
would
have
been
of
the
professor
and
galling
to
the
pride
of
his
class
to
have
waked
them
he
finished
his
cigarette
and
droned
unbrokenly
on
at
another
haughty
his
cane
held
at
the
approved
parisian
angle
broke
in
upon
the
lecture
with
a
greeting
which
the
professor
interrupted
his
remarks
to
acknowledge
at
he
took
advantage
of
the
awakening
caused
by
the
new
arrival
to
begin
a
quiz
asking
the
white
student
something
about
the
subject
of
his
discourse
the
usual
long
preliminary
sparring
for
wind
in
the
form
of
señor
don
pedro
calderón
de
la
garca
one
of
the
most
important
authors
of
his
epoch
in
spain
and
so
through
a
long
list
of
stock
phrases
was
followed
by
a
mumbling
of
some
vague
and
general
rubbish
he
could
easily
have
framed
up
had
he
not
known
whether
señor
don
pedro
was
man
woman
or
priest
when
he
had
said
nothing
for
about
two
minutes
one
of
the
others
was
given
the
doubt
the
professor
apologized
later
for
being
obliged
to
call
upon
them
because
of
the
presence
of
a
distinguished
foreign
launched
forth
in
another
set
of
phrases
like
the
other
he
did
not
know
the
title
of
any
of
calderón
s
dramas
who
left
only
a
hundred
or
two
to
choose
from
though
the
class
had
studied
several
of
those
works
during
the
year
s
course
after
each
question
the
professor
broke
in
upon
the
meaningless
mumble
to
answer
his
query
himself
and
as
he
named
the
works
one
by
one
the
student
cried
out
each
time
with
a
great
display
of
wisdom
ah
sí
señor
es
verdad
señor
as
he
would
have
done
had
the
former
inadvertently
included
quo
vadis
or
at
the
professor
carefully
called
the
roll
to
find
out
how
many
of
the
seven
were
present
entered
that
important
fact
on
an
official
blank
to
be
left
with
the
rector
at
the
end
of
the
day
and
with
much
bowing
and
ceremonious
formality
the
class
took
leave
of
themselves
lighted
their
cigarettes
tucked
their
canes
under
their
arms

faded
away

long

at

reminded
me
of
some
scene
from
the
pages
of
dickens
i
was
bowed
to
an
ancient
couch
at
one
side
of
the
dismal
adobe
room
the
secretary
in
an
aged
overcoat
of
various
degrees
of
fadedness
and
an
enormous
neck
muffler
sitting
at
a
medieval
table
my
friend
the
judge
of
the
first
instance
in
sartorial
splendor
sat
at
another
his
silk
hat
upside
down
before
him
he
had
arranged
the
case
of
an
italian
shopkeeper
who
had
been
robbed
the
saturday
before
the
italian
being
summoned
entered
bowed
remained
standing
gave
his
name
age
and
other
personal
details
took
the
oath
then
he
told
his
story
in
his
own
words
to
the
judge
who
asked
questions
but
made
no
attempt
at
rather
helping
the
witness
in
his
answers
when
he
stumbled
or
paused
for
want
of
a
spanish
word
meanwhile
the
secretary
busied
himself
with
rolling
and
consuming
innumerable
cigarettes
when
he
had
finished
his
tale
the
italian
was
shown
for
the
purpose
of
identification
some
articles
sent
over
from
the
intendencia
as
taken
from
the
prisoner
s
pocket
after
which
they
still
remained
in
the
hands
of
then
the
witness
sat
down
and
the
judge
himself
dictated
the
story
in
his
own
words
to
the
secretary
the
latter
armed
himself
with
a
steel
pen
dipped
it
incessantly
into
a
viceregal
inkwell
and
peering
over
the
top
of
his
glasses
laboriously
wrote
in
a
copybook
hand
three
words
at
a
time
repeating
them
aloud
shorthand
is
unknown
in
the
government
offices
of
the
andes
it
would
be
too
much
to
ask
a
political
henchman
to
learn
stenography
or
anything
else
for
the
mere
purpose
of
holding
a
government
position
typewriters
are
expensive
moreover
typewritten
documents
are
not
legal
in
most
governmental
formalities
so
a
system
would
be
lacking
in
dignity
for
such
solemn
purposes
and
its
introduction
would
require
new
effort
on
the
part
of
secretaries
whose
only
asset
is
the
medieval
art
of
penmanship
the
endless
task

and

italian
dismissed
one
of
the
prisoners
a
boy
of
eighteen
of
degenerate
type
was
brought
in
by
an
indian
soldier
and
testified
in
the
same
manner
as
the
plaintiff
had
done
he
was
not
required
to
take
the
oath
but
was
warned
to
tell
the
truth
again
it
was
his
own
story
just
as
he
chose
to
tell
it
with
no
attempt
to
trip
him
up
and
even
occasional
assistance
this
the
judge
redictated
in
his
own
more
cultured
language
that
the
archives
of
cuzco
should
not
be
marred
by
the
undignified
speech
of
the
masses
and
the
trial
was
over
a
wished
to
testify
in
the
case
but
as
there
are
no
schools
in
peru
for
those
so
afflicted
there
was
no
one
who
could
understand
him
in
short
a
trial
in
consists
of
nothing
but
the
making
of
affidavits
there
called
these
are
seen
only
by
the
judge
not
even
the
prisoner
s
lawyer
being
to
them
later
if
there
is
found
time
for
it
comes
the
in
which
the
judge
reads
in
his
private
study
the
various
declarations
and
passes
judgment
and
sentence
likewise
in
privacy
which
sentence
must
be
reviewed
by
the
superior
court
of
the
department
the
curious
may
ask
where
the
lawyer
for
the
prisoner
comes
in
i
was
informed
that
he
sees
the
prisoner
first
and
tells
him
what
to
say
in
his
thus
is
the
secret
mysterious
justice
of
a
joke
at
so
much
a
word
as
they
call
it
in
ecuador
administered
if
one
has
a
man
arrested
one
must
hire
a
lawyer
to
find
out
what
happened
to
him
i
next
went
with
the
judge
in
his
gleaming
hat
and
surrounded
by
his
suite
of
courtiers
to
the
prison
on
the
banks
of
the
noisome
huatenay
the
departmental
place
of
confinement
consisted
of
an
spanish
dwelling
built
around
a
large
courtyard
a
dismal
patio
in
which
were
gathered
prisoners
from
all
parts
of
peru
s
largest
department
from
white
men
of
the
capital
to
indians
of
the
who
know
so
little
of
the
ways
of
government
that
they
thought
they
were
being
held
by
their
tribal
enemies
everyone
was
doing
whatever
he
chose
with
a
freedom
from
restraint
that
recalled
the
debtors
prisons
of
england
a
century
ago
as
in
most
penal
institutions
there
was
no
evidence
of
cruelty
or
unkindness
to
inmates
except
the
passive
cruelty
of
neglect
most
of
the
outward
forms
of
courtesy
being
kept
up
between
officials
and
prisoners
by
night
the
latter
slept
in
mud
cells
of
the
rambling
adobe
building
on
earth
floors
as
bare
as
those
of
an
indian
hut
unless
like
the
traveler
in
the
sierra
they
brought
their
own
beds
with
them
no
food
worthy
the
name
was
furnished
outside
the
patio
separated
from
it
by
a
massive
iron
wicket
were
the
wives
temporary
or
otherwise
of
the
prisoners
who
had
brought
them
dinner
in
baskets
pots
or
knotted
cloths
this
custom
of
having
the
judge
visit
the
place
of
confinement
is
not
without
its
advantages
at
least
it
gives
him
a
personal
knowledge
of
what
a
sentence
means
as
long
as
we
remained
a
constant
line
of
prisoners
crowded
around
my
companion
to
tell
their
grievances
those
who
wore
hats
carried
them
in
their
hands
but
the
cringing
indians
who
mumbled
their
complaints
in
quichua
did
not
remove
their
earlap
skating
caps
the
petitioners
ranged
all
the
way
from
four
wildmen
from
the
to
the
east
to
a
white
and
youth
who
began
your
honor
excuses
me
but
i
have
now
been
here
seven
months
and
if
you
could
be
pleased
to
arrange
that
they
have
my
trial
some
day
before
long
it
is
a
short
but
rather
breathless
climb
in
this
altitude
from
the
level
of
the
town
to
the
ancient
fortress
of
sacsahuaman
frowning
down
upon
cuzco
from
feet
above
on
the
city
side
the
hill
hangs
almost
precipitous
the
town
piled
part
way
up
it
but
a
flanking
road
soon
brings
one
out
beside
the
most
massive
monument
of
aboriginal
art
on
the
american
continent
the
cyclopean
ruins
are
as
garsilaso
put
it
rather
cliffs
than
walls
and
how
these
enormous
boulders
of
which
mathematicians
compute
the
largest
to
weigh
a
little
matter
of
tons
were
set
in
position
on
this
lofty
headland
by
a
race
that
knew
neither
horses
nor
oxen
will
ever
remain
as
great
a
mystery
as
the
building
of
the
pyramids
only
one
thing
is
certain
that
the
builders
had
unlimited
labor
at
their
command
and
that
time
was
no
object
prescott
s
so
finely
wrought
it
was
impossible
to
detect
the
line
of
junction
between
the
rocks
is
scarcely
true
the
detection
is
more
than
easy
but
it
is
hard
to
believe
these
monster
walls
were
constructed
by
the
ancestors
of
the
stolid
and
ambitionless
indians
one
sees
peddling
their
wares
in
the
of
cuzco
these
downtrodden
descendants
take
the
amazing
works
of
their
forebears
for
granted
as
we
accept
the
constructions
of
nature
and
never
dream
of
attempting
to
imitate
them
indeed
many
contend
that
they
were
not
built
but
grew
up
by
enchantment
nations
like
individuals
have
enthusiasm
and
initiative
for
great
enterprises
in
their
youth
and
are
apt
to
settle
down
to
contentment
with
the
mediocre
in
middle
age
which
there
are
hints
that
the
race
we
roughly
call
inca
had
reached
at
the
time
of
the
conquest
the
massive
triple
walls
of
the
fortress
were
built
in
zigzag
form
with
salient
angles
from
which
the
defenders
within
could
fall
upon
their
enemies
making
it
sufficient
protection
to
the
imperial
city
without
the
necessity
of
surrounding
that
with
walls
even
after
the
effete
modern
inhabitants
have
tumbled
all
the
stones
they
could
move
down
into
the
city
to
build
their
own
temples
and
efforts
of
lilliputians
among
despite
the
damage
wrought
by
ruthless
the
main
portion
of
the
great
fortress
of
sacsahuaman
still
remains
intact
to
bring
upon
the
beholder
a
rage
that
pizarro
and
his
should
have
destroyed
like
bulls
in
a
the
empire
that
wrought
such
marvels
a
wonder
at
what
might
have
been
had
the
conquest
of
peru
never
taken
place
in
ancient
days
whenever
the
son
of
an
inca
put
a
bent
pin
of
champi
in
the
imperial
chair
the
resulting
box
on
the
ear
must
have
been
accompanied
with
a

is

rational
explanation

mutilation
which
every

and
for
a
circuit
of
many
miles
around
the
city
of
the
sun
suffered
before
the
conquest
everywhere
huge

in

are
fantastically

imaginable
form
with

had
nothing
to

sit
around
admiring

from

which
his
dynasty
was
so
fond

imagination

to
picture
him
watching
athletic

on

little

before

chuckling
behind
his
imperial
mask
at
the
antics
of
children
sliding
down

or
as
do
still
those
youths
of
cuzco
who
are
low
enough
in
caste
not
to
jeopardize
their
dignity
by
such
antics
over
behind
the
ruins
and
carved
rocks
i
found
all
the
provincial
authorities
gathered
one
sunday
to
uncover
another
of
the
many
immense
boulders
that
had
lain
for
centuries
disguised
as
a
mound

the

confined
their

to

was
done
by
the
alguaciles
jealously
clinging
to
their
staffs
of
office
even
as
they
toiled
the
digging
brought
to
light
not
only
another
huge
fantastically
carved
but
a
hint
of
how
sacsahuaman
might
have
been
built
the
incas
had
but
to
call
in
men
from
all
the
district
roundabout
under
their
commanders
of
tens
and
if
a
thousand
did
not
suffice
to
move
a
stone
nothing
was
easier
than
to
summon
two
or
five
or
ten
thousand
thus
the
government
of
has
continued
many
of
the
ancient
ways
as
the
church
has
grafted
its
own
forms
on
the

is
the
view
of
cuzco
from
the

of
the

wooden

at
the
summit

so
steep
is
the
hill
on

side

so
close
to
the
town
that
it
seems
almost
to
bulge
out
over
it
and
all
the
imperial
city
lies
spread
out
beneath
as
from
an
aeroplane
its
every
plaza
and
patio
in
full
view
to
its
very
depths
the
activities
of

as
plainly
visible

lifted
away

an

along

between

the

to
the

as

with
perfect
regularity
adorned
with
beautiful
palaces
and

even
under
the

of
the
unclouded

it
is
a
scene
no
mere
words
can
bring
to
him
who
has
not
looked
down
upon
it
in

the
soft
red
of
its

the

of

no

up
distinctly
playing
in
the

haughtily
challenging
the

to
combat
a
weary

booming
a
belated
summons
the
screech
of

rising
as
a
regiment
of
the
garrison
that
keeps
cuzco
loyal
to
those
degenerate

sets
out
on

all
blending

into

that

bodily

chapter
xvii
a
forgotten
city
of
the
andes
the
traveler
of
is
seldom
granted
the
pleasure
of
visiting
really
new
territory
how
much
more
rarely
comes
the
joy
of
being
one
of
the
first
of
modern
men
to
tread
the
streets
of
an
entire
city
unrivaled
in
location
and
unknown
to
history
such
however
is
the
privilege
of
those
who
come
up
to
cuzco
in
these
days
with
the
time
and
disregard
for
roughing
it
necessary
to
visit
machu
picchu
the
mysterious
city
of
the
incas
or
their
predecessors
now
called
by
that
name
was
unknown
to
civilized
man
and
the
world
until
professor
hiram
bingham
of
yale
visited
the
site
in
to
come
back
a
year
later
in
charge
of
the
expedition
that
cleared
it
of
the
rampant
jungle
growth
and
the
oblivion
of
ages
here
was
uncovered
what
are
perhaps
the
most
splendid
ruins
in
the
western
hemisphere
most
splendid
because
in
addition
to
being
the
most
cuzco
since
the
conquest
they
have
not
been
wrecked
by
or
confused
with
spanish
building
the
account
of
the
find
had
overtaken
me
in
lima
and
all
the
tramp
across
peru
to
the
ancient
city
of
the
sun
had
been
gladdened
by
the
anticipation
of
visiting
a
spot
that
not
only
promised
extraordinary
interest
in
itself
but
had
the
added
attraction
of
being
difficult
of
access
i
had
planned
to
travel
to
machu
picchu
alone
and
afoot
in
cuzco
however
it
was
my
good
fortune
to
run
across
professor
of
our
middle
west
and
to
change
in
consequence
my
customary
mode
of
transportation
we
called
on
the
prefect
together
his
mind
wandered
as
do
those
of
all
his
class
to
his
or
whatever
it
is
that
sends
the
andean
official
even
while
he
puzzled
to
account
for
the
joint
appearance
of
a
famous
sociologist
recommended
by
the
president
of
the
republic
and
a
tramp
who
had
arrived
on
foot
his
secretary
at
length
delivered
an
impressive
document
informing
whomever
it
might
concern
that
we
were
going
to
when
i
protested
the
prefect
assured
the
professor
it
was
often
spelled
that
way
i
insisted
whereupon
he
and
the
secretary
sneaked
off
and
found
a
geography
and
this
time
got
all
right
except
the
date
that
was
a
week
behind
time
which
was
perhaps
in
keeping
with
the
local
color
martinelli
of
the
cinema
who
volunteered
to
accompany
us
owned
a
coast
horse
and
a
wise
gray
leaving
the
prefect
to
obey
his
telegraphic
orders
only
to
the
extent
of
furnishing
another
animal
capable
of
keeping
the
professor
s
feet
off
the
ground
this
was
not
so
easy
as
it
may
sound
for
the
professor
had
finally
halted
in
his
physical
rise
in
the
world
about
midway
between
the
six
and
seven
foot
mark
and
the
horses
of
the
andes
are
rarely
spoken
of
without
tacking
on
the
spanish
diminutive
having
already
spent
more
than
a
year
among
the
people
of
the
andes
i
was
by
no
means
so
surprised
as
the
professor
when
upon
descending
in
full
road
regalia
to
the
cobbled
street
at
six
we
found
no
sign
of
the
horse
the
prefect
had
solemnly
promised
to
have
standing
saddled
at
our
hotel
door
at
five
some
things
come
to
him
who
in
peru
however
and
by
the
time
the
third
round
of
anecdotes
was
ended
there
broke
the
street
vista
and
drifted
down
upon
us
a
peruvian
soldier
in
full
accoutrements
bestriding
a
sorrowful
little
black
mule
and
leading
as
gaunt
and
decrepit
a
as
even
i
had
ever
seen
among
those
shaggy
ponies
that
masquerade
under
the
name
of
horse
throughout
the
andes
the
soldier
dismounted
and
saluted
the
professor
stood
gazing
abstractedly
down
upon
the
animal
no
doubt
drawing
a
mental
picture
of
himself
in
the
rôle
of
don
quixote
with
the
added
touch
of
dragging
his
toes
on
the
ground
over
miles
of
andean
trails
with
a
snort
and
a
speed
that
proved
his
four
years
in
the
united
states
had
not
been
entirely
misspent
martinelli
disappeared
in
the
direction
of
the
prefectura
before
another
hour
had
drifted
into
the
past
he
reappeared
followed
by
a
second
soldier
leading
a
real
horse
from
the
corral
of
the
officers
of
the
garrison
how
did
you
manage
it
i
asked
in
admiration
i
raised
hell
said
martinelli
tightening
the
girth
of
his
own
animal
what
peru
most
needs
mused
the
professor
who
has
the
happy
faculty
of
now
and
then
giving
his
professional
vocabulary
a
furlough
is
about
ten
thousand
of
you
young
fellows
educated
abroad
to
come
home
here
and
raise
plainly
the
professor
was
already
beginning
to
get
a
real
mental
grasp
on
south
america
we
transferred
the
government
saddle
to
the
real
horse
and
by
eight
were
clattering
away
over
the
cobblestones
of
the
city
of
the
incas
the
soldier
on
his
sorrowful
black
mule
bringing
up
a
funereal
rear
this
was
doing
very
well
indeed
to
get
off
on
the
same
day
planned
at
any
hour
whatever
is
no
slight
feat
in
the
andes
such
of
cuzco
as
had
already
lifted
its
frowsy
head
from
the
pillow
gazed
out
upon
us
as
we
wound
and
clashed
our
stony
way
up
out
of
the
city
by
that
breakneck
stairway
down
which
i
had
descended
from
my
journey
the
morning
sunlight
fell
weirdly
upon
the
city
of
the
sun
below
when
we
reached
the
notch
in
the
hills
where
all
indians
pause
before
the
last
view
of
the
sacred
capital
of
their
ancestors
to
murmur
with
bared
heads
o
cuzco
great
city
i
bid
thee
adieu
as
we
jogged
on
in
the
sunny
october
morning
across
the
bare
colorful
cool
hills
of
cuzco
toward
the
lofty
pampa
beyond
i
turned
to
ask
the
soldier
behind
cómo
te
llamas
tomás
he
replied
with
a
military
salute
tomás
cobino
sargento
de
la
gendarmería
can
you
be
that
same
tomás
who
was
with
the
americans
in
machu
picchu
sí
señor
i
attended
three
months
in
their
the
means
has
not
yet
been
found
of
convincing
the
people
of
the
sierra
that
digging
about
old
ruins
can
have
any
motive
other
than
that
of
seeking
the
traditional
treasures
of
the
incas
a
few
miles
out
the
road
was
in
the
throes
of
repair
by
a
large
gang
of
indians
under
command
of
the
alguaciles
of
the
neighboring
hamlets
who
stood
haughtily
by
firmly
grasping
their
staffs
of
office
they
looked
not
at
all
like
worldlings
but
like
men
from
mars
commanded
by
pirates
at
first
we
met
many
the
leaders
wearing
about
their
necks
long
jangling
bells
with
wooden
clappers
the
cuzco
indian
of
the
color
of
old
brass
with
his
bare
legs
scanty
and
flat
sneaked
noiselessly
by
with
the
air
of
a
whipped
cur
fawningly
removing
his
pancake
hat
and
murmuring
an
abject
the
greeting
sounded
like
quichua
but
is
merely
what
becomes
of
the
spanish
ave
maría
purísima
in
the
mouth
of
the
aboriginal
the
professor
showed
great
astonishment
to
find
even
the
women
raising
their
hats
in
salutation
but
martinelli
and
i
had
long
since
grown
to
expect
it
in
his
democracy
he
touched
his
own
hat
and
repeated
buenos
días
señor
to
each
indian
s
greeting
instead
of
acknowledging
it
with
a
surly
grunt
or
haughty
silence
in
the
peruvian
fashion
he
would
have
been
astonished
to
know
how
the
startled
native
cudgeled
his
primitive
brain
all
the
way
home
there
to
roll
about
his
mud
hut
telling
his
fellows
how
he
had
met
a
kara
so
roaring
drunk
that
he
called
him
señor
as
if
he
were
a
white
man
within
an
hour
the
trail
swung
to
the
right
away
over
our
left
shoulders
lay
that
splendid
plain
of
anta
rich
with
cattle
and
historical
memories
of
the
conquistadores
the
distant
bleat
of
sheep
now
and
then
drew
our
eyes
to
a
bedraggled
little
indian
shepherdess
armed
with
a
sling
and
spinning
incessantly
automatically
the
crude
native
yarn
on
her
cruder
spindle
of
a
run
through
a
potato
as
as
she
edged
cautiously
away
these
lonely
guardians
of
the
flocks
are
not
infrequently
pursued
with
impunity
by
native
travelers
and
are
even
known
to
resort
to
mechanical
means
to
frustrate
attack
in
this
treeless
region
the
doors
of
the
indians
dismal
mud
hovels
were
of
stiff
hairy
cowhides
as
the
bare
world
rose
still
higher
even
these
miserable
dwellings
died
out
and
only
the
bleak
brown
uplands
of
the
andes
spread
about
us
on
every
hand
in
we
topped
a
great
bare
from
the
chilly
summit
of
which
the
central
cordillera
stretched
like
some
mighty
wall
across
the
entire
horizon
the
and
glaciers
thrusting
their
hoary
heads
through
the
banks
of
clouds
then
a
vast
andean
valley
like
those
that
had
long
since
grown
so
familiar
to
me
yet
were
always
beautiful
opened
out
before
us
in
its
lap
the
town
of
maras
tinted
the
pale
red
of
its
aged
tile
roofs
the
great
rolling
basin
was
surrounded
by
mountainsides
speckled
with
little
shadowed
valleys
and
perpendicular
or
tiny
indian
farms
hung
on
their
flanks
like
small
paintings
on
slightly
inclined
walls
we
halted
for
dinner
with
the
gobernador
and
for
as
the
incas
called
dried
cornstalks
with
ears
and
to
admire
the
view
and
the
doorways
of
mud
houses
sculptured
with
bastard
designs
we
went
on
again
over
the
high
brown
barren
world
the
summit
of
each
succeeding
bringing
again
above
the
horizon
the
great
wall
that
each
time
seemed
near
yet
all
the
jogging
day
appeared
not
a
yard
nearer
at
three
we
came
suddenly
to
a
vast
split
in
the
earth
into
which
we
began
to
go
down
and
ever
down
by
acute
zigzags
and
stony
that
grew
so
steep
we
had
to
dismount
and
lead
our
animals
before
and
below
us
spread
the
magnificent
cañon
of
the
urubamba
that
river
of
many
names
which
rising
near
titicaca
at
length
adds
its
bit
to
the
giant
amazon
spring
plowing
was
in
progress
on
the
valley
floor
walled
by
mountains
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
in
either
direction
over
this
rampart
the
sun
still
peered
when
we
reached
the
level
of
the
river
at
last
and
picking
up
the
road
from
up
the
valley
jogged
down
along
it
terraces
of
the
incas
were
frequent
here
and
there
far
up
the
sheer
enclosing
bluffs
were
the
ruins
of
of
rough
stone
at
times
the
road
was
itself
one
of
these
ancient
terraces
the
retaining
wall
of
the
one
above
rubbing
our
left
elbows
a
sheer
drop
of
some
eight
feet
to
that
below
close
on
our
right
in
places
the
river
itself
was
faced
and
narrowed
by
massive
the
exotic
iron
bridge
replacing
the
former
one
of
braided
withes
by
which
we
crossed
to
ollantaytambo
had
a
central
pier
of
those
enormous
boulders
which
the
bygone
race
seemed
to
toss
about
at
will
we
rode
to
the
bare
plaza
past
splendid
walls
of
what
had
once
been
palaces
little
inferior
to
those
of
cuzco
the
local
authority
bowed
low
over
our
passport
and
turned
the
over
to
us
for
the
night
this
was
an
all
but
windowless
room
opening
on
the
unfurnished
plaza
with
a
springy
earth
floor
laid
on
poles
into
it
shrinking
alguaciles
lugged
our
baggage
and
a
rheumatic
table
and
bench
without
once
releasing
their
staffs
of
office
tomás
our
had
found
the
bringing
up
of
the
rear
a
heavy
task
and
he
and
his
worn
and
sorrowful
black
mule
arrived
with
the
last
rays
of
the
setting
sun
meanwhile
the
egg
supply
of
ollantaytambo
having
been
greatly
reduced
we
spread
our
and
lay
down
with
heads
to
the
walls
for
the
slope
of
the
floor
was
such
that
to
stretch
along
them
would
have
been
to
fetch
up
before
morning
in
a
tangled

that

flat
with

a

in

succeeding

on

swift

and
for
miles
up
a
side
gully
to
the
east
the
inhabitants
of
unemotional
indians
as
in
all
this
region
still
occupy
much
of
the
old
inca
town
with
its
streets
between
massive
stone
walls
that
grow
more
and
more
careless
in
construction
in
direct
ratio
to
their
distance
from
the

whole

of
these
ancient
houses
are
still
intact
except
for
the
roofs
a
single
doorway
giving
entrance
to
each
block
strangely
enough
this
was
the

unbroken
exterior

around
an
interior

it
fallen
to
men
of
the

more
struck

there
incorporated
with

as
in

many
an

has
been
superimposed
on
the

of
what
must
have
been
at
least
a
king
s
palace
far
up
the
sheer
bluff
behind
the
ancient
town
hangs
the
school
bright
yellow
in
color
constructed
according
to
the
alcalde
of
some
substance
that
has
not
disintegrated
under
the
rain
and
sunshine
of
centuries
from
below
it
looks
more
like
a
building
than
the
five
terraces
piled
one
above
the
other
on
the
inaccessible
face
of
the
mountain
which
it
really
is
if
as
is
commonly
accepted
it
was
a
school
for
children
of
the
the
incas
like
the
priests
who
have
inherited
their
power
did
not
believe
in
education
for
the
common
daily
climb
to
and
descent
from
it
eliminated
any
necessity
for
a
course
in
physical
training
whether
the
school
was
built
by
another
race
or
whether
those
whose
massive
monuments
cover
the
site
below
could
not
carry
their
blocks
of
stone
so
far
aloft
is
but
another
of
those
baffling
mysteries
that
hover
forever
over
the
ruins
of
the
andes
about
the
town
are
several
baths
of
carved
stone
which
may
rather
have
been
reservoirs
for
drinking
for
one
will
not
believe
that
a
bath
was
ever
a
part
of
the
equipment
of
the
andean
indian
as
everywhere
within
a
radius
of
many
miles
about
cuzco
every
possible
boulder
or
is
carved
into
seats
steps
grottoes
every
fantastic
shape
a
tyrannic
mind
could
have
conceived
a
score
of
grotesque
forms
that
can
only
be
accounted
for
as
the
whims
of
some
despot
the
ancient
peruvian
emperors
seem
to
have
believed
as
firmly
as
the
windjammer
s
bo
s
n
who
sets
his
crew
to
picking
oakum
in
the
relationship
between
idle
hands
and
mischief
and
to
have
assigned
the
otherwise
unengaged
the
task
of
carving
the
nearest
boulder

the
remaining
half
of
the
miles
from
cuzco
to
mandorpampa

us
we
were
away
betimes
in
the
soft
morning
tinged
with
coolness
from
off
the
above
as
we
rode
northeastward
into
the
sunrise
down
the
right
bank
of
the
urubamba
gradually
as
the
morning
warmed
the
glaciers
of
piri
and
its
neighbors
shook
off
their
night
wraps
of
clouds
until
they
stood
forth
above
us
in
all
their
massive
grandeur
the
valley
narrowed
to
a
cañon
and
that
to
a
gorge
with
repulsive
bare
mountain
walls
standing
precipitously
more
than
a
thousand
feet
into
the
sky
on
either
hand
here
and
there
the
river
was
hurried
between
retaining
walls
laboriously
constructed
by
the
bygone
race
often
these
alone
held
us
up
as
the
precipice
shouldered
us
to
the
sheer
edge
of
the
stream
sometimes
indeed
the
road
was
hewn
out
of
the
perpendicular
mountainside
and
carried
tremulously
across
from
one
solid
foothold
to
another
on
props
of
stone
straight
above
us
on
virtually
unassailable
crags
were
the
ruins
of
walls
and
perhaps
small
forts
the
holders
of
which
might
have
showered
down
boulders
squarely

marvelous

went
down
by
frequent
little
stony
descents
with
no

rises
of
now
and

standing
in

stirrups
as
our
animals
dropped
from

conscious
self
gazing
at

enthralling
scene

fiery
native

in

inside
wooden
frames
or
long
cylindrical
packages
of
such
as
the
drivers
were
chewing
often
the
meetings
were
at
points
where
only
extreme
vigilance
saved
us
from
being
pushed
over
the
precipice
for
though
our
right
of
way
gave
us
the
mountainside
the
shy
of
the
roaring
stream
below
sought
to
crowd
in

us
and
the
wall
in
spite
of
the
threatening
cries
and
whistling
of
their
arrieros
at
eleven
we
stopped
for
by
the
time
we
were
in
the
saddle
again
the
vegetation
began
to
grow
frankly
tropical
the
approach
to
the
vast
amazonian
lowlands
was
heralded
by
trees
then
by
whole
forests
climbing
the
lower
flanks
of
the
hills
that
cut
in
alternately
from
either
side
then
they
began
clothing
the
lower
ridges
and
the
flanks
of
the
mountains
themselves
in
delightful
contrast
to
the
dreary
treelessness
of
the
upper
heights
the

trees
of
the

crowding
in
among
the
hardy
shrubs
of
the
lower

began
to
stand
forth
against
the
irregular
patches
of
sky
ahead
jungle
brush
and
undergrowth
sprang
up
about
us
moss
and
tropical
herbage
took
to
draping
the
moist
rocks
and
boulders
until
even
the
perpendicular
face
of
the
mountain
clothed
itself
in
vegetation
ferns
the
first
i
had
seen
in
months
appeared
and
quickly
grew
to
their
gigantic
tropical
forms

were
plentiful

brilliant
colors

telegraph
wire
that
had
followed
us
across
the
bleak
puna
the
day
before
on
poles
shriveled
with
the
cold
began
to
jump
gaily
from
tree
to
tree
brooks
of
sparkling
clear
water
came
leaping
down
from
the
unseen
glaciers
and
frozen
heights
above
to
the
joy
of
both
man
and
beast
a
condor
volplaning
on
motionless
wings
high
above
the
mountain
wall
looked
like
a
sparrow
mingled
with
the
white
clouds
that
flecked
the
summer
sky
a
soft
wind
caressed
us
and
upon
us
fell
that
lazy
contented
mood
that
always
follows
a
descent
from
the
cold
páramo
as
we
descended
still
deeper
into
the
fastnesses
of
the
andes
the
solid
granite
precipices
rising
sheer
thousands
of
feet
from
the
foaming
rapids
to
the
clouds
remained
at
the
same
height
but
the
valley
of
the
river
continued
to
descend
and
gave
us
the
curious
effect
of
seeming
to
see
the
mountains
that
shut
us
in
rise
ever
higher
into
the
sky
the
cañon
of
the
urubamba
had
shrunk
to
a
resounding
gorge
of
sharp
with
virtually
no
room
left
for
cultivation
so
that
even
the
hardy
of
the
ancients
were
crowded
out
of
existence
and
only
the
imperious
river
forced
its
way
through
the
mountains
permitting
the
narrow
road
to
follow
on
the
precarious
footholds
blasted
for
it
along
one
of
the
towering
granite
walls
we
began
to
meet
yellow
walking
skeletons
straggling
languidly
up
from
the
tropical
valleys
these
increased
until
all
the
few
travelers
were
gaunt
and
and
of
a
lifeless
cast
of
countenance
now
a
humid
jungle
hemmed
us
in
impenetrable
tropical
forest
covered
all
the
tumbled
mountain
world
about
us
the
further
ranges
with
distance
an
unbroken
wilderness
in
which
might
lie
buried
a
score
of
forgotten
cities
trees
assumed
those
fantastic
shapes
that
startle
or
mock
the
tropical
traveler
lianas
those
great
climbing
vines
over
which
the
northern
dreams
before
his
open
geography
while
the
snow
swirls
about
the
shivering
window
swung
languidly
from
these
giants
of
the
jungle
the
rampant
vegetation
clutched
playfully
at
us
along
the
way
now
and
again
a
branch
reached
forth
and
whipped
us
in
our
sweated
faces
the
drowsy
chorus
of
the
jungles
sounded
about
us
the
tropical
joy
of
life
took
possession
even
of
the
professor
rousing
him
to
song
so
that
the
cañon
resounded
with
discordant
rumbling
noises
toward
four
the
beautiful
jagged
peak
of
huayna
picchu
came
into
sight
down
the
winding
gorge
puffs
of
white
clouds
hovering
about
it
and
we
knew
we
were
approaching
our
goal
but
things
moved
with
ever
more
tropical
languor
in
places
the
road
became
a
stony
stairway
down
which
we
must
pick
our
way
step
by
step
in
others
it
was
pieced
together
with
slivers
of
rock
to
keep
it
from
falling
sheer
into
the
angry
stream
below
the
impending
crags
squeezed
the
trail
to
the
extreme
edge
so
that
an
unwary
horseman
gazing
at
the
riches
of
nature
about
him
was
not
infrequently
rapped
on
the
head
by
jagged
points
of
rock
left
by
the
dynamite
of
the
tropical
birds
of
startling
plumage
flitted
in
and
out
of
the
impenetrable
undergrowth
the
pungent
yet
enticing
scent
of
the
tropics
filled
our
nostrils
the
sun
abandoned
us
early
and
left
us
with
a
sense
of
being
down
in
some
great
well
dreamily
wondering
whether
we
should
ever
again
reach
the
broad
open
world
above
dusk
was
falling
when
the
road
wandered
out
upon
a
bit
of
flat
meadow
squeezed
between
the
mountain
wall
and
the
now
calmer
river
facing
the
breakneck
slopes
of
huayna
picchu
this
was
mandorpampa
a
hut
on
poles
served
as
tambo
as
we
hung
our
alforjas
over
the
unhewn
beams
an
unattractive
past
middle
age
and
scented
with
appeared
from
the
adjoining
hut
he
occupied
with
a
flock
of
women
and
children
it
was
he
who
had
first
guided
to
the
then
machu
picchu
he
had
long
known
of
the
ruins
as
had
other
natives
but
had
never
considered
them
extensive
or
important
indeed
he
seemed
still
to
have
a
distinctly
low
opinion
of
them
as
things
of
the
gentiles
not
to
be
compared
with
the
cathedral
of
cuzco
with
its
tin
saints
and
tinseled
virgins
he
promised
to
climb
to
the
site
with
us
in
the
morning
however
for
a
consideration
and
i
fell
to
preparing
supper
over
my
miniature
after
it
we
sat
for
a
time
in
the
heavy
humming
tropical
night
listening
to
the
of
jungle
crickets
and
striving
by
anecdote
and
song
to
keep
up
the
professor
s
spirits
drooping
under
the
dread
of
snakes
and
vipers
and
the
thousand
subtle
dangers
of
the
tropics
for
the
night
we
arranged
that
martinelli
should
share
with
the
family
chickens
the
pole
couch
of
the
indian
s
knowing
that
as
a
peruvian
he
preferred
to
sleep
in
as
airless
a
spot
as
possible
while
the
professor
and
i
prepared
to
hoist
ourselves
up
into
the
garret
of
small
poles
under
the
low
thatched
roof
of
the
tambo
it
was
like
stowing
a
piano
on
an
upper
bookshelf
but
we
got
a
bit
of
our
beds
bunched
under
us
at
last
and
when
the
poles
had
ceased
to
sag
and
creak
i
fell
asleep
the
humid
darkness
was
showing
signs
of
fading
when
i
woke
the
professor
from
a
night
during
which
by
his
own
testimony
he
had
not
slept
a
wink
the
cause
of
his
insomnia
was
not
lack
of
comfort
for
the
professor
is
an
experienced
man
of
the
woods
but
a
great
mental
anguish
an
insect
had
stung
him
on
a
knuckle
now
the
professor
had
just
come
from
investigating
that
dread
disease
of
the
andes
knows
as
from
the
quichua
word
for
rot
which
beginning
in
just
such
an
insect
bite
eats
away
the
victim
s
flesh
until
he
is
hurried
at
breakneck
speed
into
the
grave
his
was
too
fixed
a
place
in
the
life
of
our
middle
west
to
afford
to
be
rotted
away
here
in
the
peruvian
jungle
by
a
mere
insect
naturally
he
wanted
our
earnest
examination
and
experienced
opinion
whether
we
should
after
all
climb
to
machu
picchu
or
hurry
back
to
cuzco
to
call
a
conference
of
the
medical
wiseacres
i
examined
the
bite
solicitously
there
was
no
doubt
that
it
was
merely
the
preliminary
nibble
of
the
myriad
insects
that
would
have
fallen
upon
us
in
earnest
and
tattooed
us
with
the
strange
patterns
i
had
already
often
worn
had
we
descended
another
five
thousand
feet
into
the
real
tropics
but
one
can
not
put
such
things
cruelly
and
baldly
to
a
companion
weighed
down
by
the
intangible
dread
of
the
subtle
from
which
no
man
is
free
upon
his
first
descent
into
them
between
us
we
convinced
the
professor
that
he
would
in
all
probability
outlive
the
day
and
by
six
we
were
off
illustration
as
we
rode
eastward
into
the
sunrise
down
the
gorge
of
the
urubamba
piri

threw
off
its
night
wraps
of
clouds
illustration
the
semicircular
tower
and
some
of
the
finest
and
fitting
of
machu
picchu
the
vegetation
had
already
begun
to
grow
up
again
but
a
few
months
after
the
site
had
been
cleared
the
lover
of
ardent
waters
had
concluded
that
he
could
not
possibly
get
his
various
activities
in
shape
to
accompany
us
before
eight
and
we
decided
to
hobble
along
without
his
historical
assistance
we
paid
him
two
to
keep
the
animals
well
fed
and
lest
the
matter
slip
his
mind
left
tomás
with
him
as
a
perpetual
reminder
this
left
us
well
burdened
with
our
beds
and
the
supplies
necessary
to
pass
the
night
for
i
would
not
hear
of
paying
the
forgotten
city
only
a
flying
visit
being
the
only
one
in
andean
training
i
volunteered
to
carry
the
surplus
and
bowed
under
a
bulky
pounds
held
by
a
rope
across
my
chest
like
any
indian
cargador
i
led
the
way
back
along
the
road
planning
to
boast
myself
forever
after
the
equal
of
any
aboriginal
of
the
andes
barely
had
i
reconciled
myself
to
the
perpendicular
climb
in
store
for
us
under
such
a
load
however
when
we
came
upon
a
gang
of
indians
chopping
the
roadway
higher
back
under
the
edge
of
the
cliff
for
the
foreman
offered
us
carriers
none
of
them
were
large
beside
the
professor
the
impassive
fellows
approached
dwarfishness
and
i
uttered
a
protest
when
martinelli
waved
a
thumb
at
by
no
means
the
largest
but
my
fancied
equality
to
the
human
of
the
andes
oozed
away
as
suddenly
as
the
rotundity
of
a
pricked
when
the
indian
had
swung
upon
his
back
the
burden
i
had
been
staggering
under
on
a
level
roadway
martinelli
nonchalantly
tossed
his
pounds
on
top
of
it
a
bit
further
on
that
unfeeling
savage
paused
at
one
of
the
shelters
of
the
workmen
under
the
edge
of
the
impending
cliff
and
added
a
pair
of
blankets
a
and
several
other
personal
odds
and
ends
then
waltzed
away
as
lightly
as
a
prairie
chicken
under
its
than
we
cared
to
follow
perhaps
two
miles
back
a
hidden
path
plunged
swiftly
down
through
the
wet
clinging
jungle
to
the
sapling
bridge
that
hung
precariously
from
rock
to
boulder
across
the
river
beyond
the
snarling
stream
which
snatched
impotently
at
us
as
we
passed
sagging
a
perpendicular
jungled
mountainside
apparently
impenetrable
stared
impassively
down
upon
us
but
when
we
had
clambered
and
tripped
some
distance
over
the
rocks
and
jagged
boulders
at
the
edge
of
the
raging
torrent
a
hole
in
the
undergrowth
like
the
lair
of
some
wild
animal
proved
to
be
the
beginning
of
a
trail
now
overgrown
almost
to
nothing
the
first
mile
up
was
through
densest
wet
jungle
we
climbed
clutching
at
the
vegetation
as
at
the
hair
of
some
giant
head
we
were
striving
to
surmount
the
average
slope
was
perhaps
degrees
though
there
were
places
virtually
perpendicular
where
to
lose
an
andean
would
have
been
to
pitch
many
yards
down
toward
the
now
hoarse
river
below
according
to
local
repute
this
section
was
notorious
for
its
venomous
snakes
particularly
a
little
whose
bite
is
certain
death
unless
the
victim
instantly
adopts
the
heroic
measures
of
the
indians
and
carves
out
a
shylockian
chunk
of
flesh
cauterize
the
wound
with
a
hot
iron
and
retire
a
to
recuperate
but
as
with
all
tales
of
robbers
dangers
and
sudden
death
on
the
road
ahead
that
behind
me
trailed
out
harmless
and
unexciting
gradually
the
heavy
jungle
gave
way
to
a
lighter
stunted
growth
that
had
once
been
burned
over
and
on
which
the
sun
blazed
down
mercilessly
up
the
all
but
sheer
face
of
this
the
trail
sweated
in
sharp
zigzags
rumiñaui
as
we
had
dubbed
our
carrier
kept
steadily
above
us
and
though
he
panted
a
bit
it
was
the
least
burdened
of
us
who
called
now
and
then
for
a
with
thirst
we
came
at
last
to
an
almost
level
shelf
of
the
mountain
with
a
patch
of
shade
in
it
grew
a
spanish
tomato
shaped
like
a
huge
strawberry
of
a
double
acidity
that
throttled
our
thirst
for
the
moment
somewhat
higher
we
found
ourselves
mounting
ancient
agricultural
terraces
these
were
walls
of
rough
stone
head
high
that
sustained
level
spaces
of
like
width
far
from
being
under
cultivation
the
rich
black
soil
of
these
artificial
mountain
shelves
nourished
an
all
but
impassable
tangle
of
new
jungle
growth
and
the
trunks
of
great
trees
that
had
been
felled
and
charred
over
cut
us
off
in
many
directions
by
working
our
way
laboriously
back
and
forth
and
gradually
mounting
several
terraces
now
by
a
canted
now
by
the
four
projecting
stones
set
in
the
faces
of
the
walls
by
which
the
prehistoric
husbandmen
mounted
and
descended
we
found
a
terrace
along
which
we
could
tear
our
way
and
came
out
at
last
nearly
two
hours
above
the
river
on
the
sheer
edge
of
things
machu
picchu
lay
before
us
my
first
impression
was
tinged
with
disappointment
aside
from
the
universal
experience
of
finding
a
scene
striking
in
inverse
ratio
to
the
length
of
time
the
imagination
has
fed
upon
it
my
mental
picture
of
a
city
seemed
to
call
for
skyscrapers
crowded
together
over
a
vast
area
that
could
be
bound
closely
together
only
by
a
system
measured
by
these
subconscious
standards
the
town
the
incas
or
their
predecessors
had
left
here
in
the
beautiful
fastnesses
of
the
urubamba
was
small
but
at
least
it
had
been
our
good
fortune
to
catch
the
first
sight
of
it
from
a
splendid
point
of
vantage
well
below
us
and
across
a
gully
so
deep
as
to
be
almost
a
valley
the
abandoned
city
lay
spread
out
under
the
gorgeous
andean
sunshine
in
all
its
brilliancy
and
if
all
the
town
could
not
be
included
in
a
view
from
this
point
or
from
any
other
that
view
included
all
the
finer
buildings
and
left
out
chiefly
the
extensive
and
the
houses
of
those
who
lived
on
and
worked
them
though
roofless
it
was
otherwise
a
complete
city
in
so
fine
a
state
of
preservation
that
the
beholder
felt
like
one
of
the
old
spanish
conquistadores
in
those
enviable
years
when
there
were
still
new
worlds
to
discover
on
a
gigantic
scale
its
site
was
that
of
an
ancient
feudal
castle
a
mountain
ridge
defended
by
nature
in
one
of
her
most
solitary
moods
and
including
within
its
confines
the
peak
of
huayna
picchu
fell
away
on
every
side
by
tremendous
precipices
into
the
fearful
void
of
the
urubamba
a
sheer
unbroken
two
thousand
feet
to
the
river
that
makes
a
three
fourths
circle
around
it
while
beyond
pregnant
with
mystery
of
impassable
jungle
and
the
story
of
a
bygone
race
lay
a
wonderful
wilderness
of
andean
ranges
shaggy
with
dense
forest
pitched
and
tumbled
and
fading
away
in
the
of
unfathomable
distance
yet
how
strange
that
an
entire
city
a
mere
two
days
ride
from
cuzco
should
thus
have
remained
for
centuries
unknown
only
he
who
knows
the
will
comprehend
how
machu
picchu
could
be
so
seldom
visited
even
now
after
have
uncovered
it
though
the
cuzqueños
who
passively
wait
for
foreigners
to
come
and
do
what
they
themselves
should
long
since
have
done
blandly
assume
credit
for
the
newly
discovered
city
as
if
they
had
some
part
in
it
because
the
blood
of
its
builders
runs
in
their
veins
yet
to
the
world
at
large
its
existence
was
never
suspected
squier
noted
for
his
accuracy
says
ollantaytambo
was
the
frontier
town
and
fortress
of
the
incas
in
the
valley
of
the
ucayali
as
it
is
of
their
conquerors
there
were
outlying
works
some
leagues
lower
down
at
havaspampa
but
the
bulwark
of
the
empire
against
the
savage
antis
in
this
direction
was
small
wonder
he
heard
nothing
of
a
place
not
a
whisper
of
which
has
crept
into
all
the
writings
of
peru
since
pizarro
s
secretary
first
took
to
setting
down
the
prowess
of
his
commander
machu
picchu
was
indeed
a
city
of
refuge
there
is
no
need
of
incaic
lore
and
the
furrowed
brow
of
the
archeologist
to
be
certain
of
that
only
men
scared
beyond
the
functioning
of
would
have
scurried
away
into
this
most
inaccessible
nook
of
the
andes
and
scrambled
up
these
appalling
cliffs
to
escape
their
pursuers
only
men
to
whom
labor
was
nothing
as
compared
with
the
fear
of
bodily
violence
would
have
toiled
a
century
fitting
together
these
gigantic
boulders
rather
than
sally
forth
and
take
their
chances
against
the
slings
or
poisoned
arrows
of
their
enemies
the
slinking
cuzco
indian
of
may
easily
be
their
lineal
descendant
effectively
defended
by
nature
though
they
were
these
champions
of
precaution
left
no
loopholes
across
the
gully
between
where
we
sat
and
the
lost
city
they
had
thrown
two
massive
stone
walls
from
sheer
precipice
to
sheerer
outside
this
were
most
of
the
agricultural
terraces
for
within
the
city
proper
was
scant
space
for
cultivation
and
in
case
of
attack
the
peasants
no
doubt
abandoned
their
fields
and
raced
to
town
between
these
walls
lay
a
dry
moat
deep
and
wide
while
at
the
city
gate
the
fortress
was
constructed
on
the
salient
system
of
sacsahuaman
so
that
while
a
besieger
was
gently
knocking
for
admittance
some
member
of
the
clan
could
stroll
out
on
the
wall
above
and
drop
a
boulder
on
his
astonished
head
nor
was
that
all
in
every
least
crevice
or
foothold
across
which
the
champion
trapeze
performer
or
artist
of
the
besieging
tribes
could
by
any
stretch
of
the
trembling
imagination
have
squirmed
his
way
the
defenders
built
little
patches
of
in
places
he
only
will
believe
who
has
climbed
to
see
and
on
the
tiptop
of
the
neighboring
heights
on
machu
picchu

on
the
of
huayna
picchu
in
every
crow
the
most
athletic
indian
could
hope
to
reach
were
stone
sometimes
invisible
from
which
certainly
the
sentinels
had
some
telegraphic
means
of
passing
word
down
to
the
cautious
city
there
were
no
adventurers
among
the
builders
of
machu
picchu
they
took
no
chances
when
we
had
drunk
in
this
comprehensive
view
of
the
forgotten
city
we
descended
by
projecting
terrace
stones
and
jungled
zigzags
and
finally
by
a
great
stone
stairway
to
the
dry
moat
then
by
a
graded
approach
to
the
city
gate
always
tearing
our
way
through
thick
undergrowth
for
though
los
chapetes
had
cleared
away
the
dense
tropical
forest
that
had
hidden
the
city
from
civilized
man
since
historical
time
began
the
rampant
vegetation
was
striving
quickly
to
conceal
it
again
as
if
jealous
of
its
beauty
or
guardian
of
its
secret
being
far
more
determined
in
its
efforts
than
the
apathetic
peruvians
it
bade
fair
to
succeed
already
the
waved
impudently
everywhere
and
what
might
grow
to
such
trees
as
had
been
felled
in
hundreds
were
already
sprouting
forth
again
here
and
there
from
between
the
interstices
of
the
splendid
walls
a
caretaker
had
been
appointed
by
the
government
but
he
was
caring
for
both
machu
picchu
and
ollantaytambo
by
living
in
cuzco
on
his
salary
illustration
we
came
out
on
the
edge
of
things
and
machu
picchu
lay
before
us
we
sent
rumiñaui
ahead
to
stack
our
junk
under
the
thatch
roof
supported
by
four
slender
legs
down
in
a
central
space
that
might
have
been
a
or
a
garden
to
fall
back
upon
in
time
of
siege
there
we
hastened
to
disentangle
the
canvas
bucket
and
bade
him
unuta
but
it
was
more
easily
ordered
than
brought
the
basins
to
which
small
had
once
carried
water
down
off
the
shoulders
of
the
range
behind
had
gone
and
as
we
lay
choking
in
the
welcome
shade
surviving
only
on
the
anticipation
of
the
cooling
draughts
soon
to
come
the
indian
came
wandering
back
with
that
apathetic
expressionlessness
of
his
bucket
empty
martinelli
rose
up
cursing
in
three
tongues
to
lead
him
and
soon
returned
to
say
that
a
bucket
was
following
close
behind
but
martinelli
was
a
peruvian
given
like
all
his
race
to
counting
his
chickens
before
the
eggs
are
laid
after
fighting
his
way
through
the
jungle
to
the
edge
of
the
hollow
where
the
spring
really
is
he
had
neglected
to
descend
ten
yards
further
through
the
bushes
to
find
whether
the
spring
really
was
so
that
a
few
yards
behind
his
resuscitating
announcement
came
trailing
rumiñaui
more
than
ever
still
carrying
a
collapsed
bucket
audible
expression
of
our
inmost
sentiments
would
have
been
the
opposite
of
and
as
each
day
consists
of
a
limited
number
of
hours
even
in
the
waterless
tropics
i
slung
my
kodak
over
a
shoulder
and
set
out
to
see
as
much
as
possible
before
preservation
of
life
might
force
a
hurried
descent
to
the
river
the
fancied
disappointment
of
the
first
view
had
worn
completely
away
as
the
mind
adapted
itself
to
standards
the
abandoned
city
assumed
its
true
aspect
that
of
a
delicate
work
of
art
of
intensive
construction
here
in
this
eagle
s
nest
of
the
andes
virtually
cut
off
from
the
rest
of
the
world
had
lived
an
artistic
and
adaptable
people
with
a
capacity
for
concentration
of
effort
for
sustained
endeavor
and
a
high
grade
of
efficiency
now
lost
among
the
peruvians
virtually
all
the
stone
work
of
the
better
part
of
the
city
was
of
the
very
best
inca
style
in
plan
cut
and
fit
nothing
i
had
seen
in
all
the
length
of
the
andes
from
cañar
in
the
far
north
could
surpass
these
walls
rivaled
only
by
those
of
cuzco
and
even
those
of
the
city
of
the
sun
can
not
match
the
charming
uniform
color
of
this
granite
approaching
in
beauty
to
pure
marble
whereas
sacsahuaman
and
ollantaytambo
seemed
massive
cyclopean
this
new
city
of
old
gives
the
effect
of
a
delicate
gem
in
a
peerless
the
man
of
ordered
to
tote
the
smallest
block
in
the
average
wall
would
not
exactly
refer
to
it
as
delicate
like
the
remains
of
cuzco
the
ruins
are
exclusively
confined
to
walls
the
inca
civilization
seems
to
have
been
of
that
utilitarian
turn
of
mind
that
gives
its
attention
chiefly
to
the
practical
with
the
result
that
there
is
not
a
statue
in
the
length
and
breadth
of
peruvian
ruins
and
the
roofs
beyond
which
these
unrivaled
did
not
advance
may
have
fallen
in
centuries
before
pizarro
first
herded
his
pigs
among
the
foothills
of
estremadura
but
as
walls
they
are
unsurpassed
fitted
with
so
tireless
a
nicety
that
even
without
mortar
they
stand
except
where
the
roots
of
trees
have
crowded
in
between
them
striking
illustrations
of
that
phrase
of
all
peruvian
chroniclers
from
garsilaso
to
squier
so
that
a
can
not
be
inserted
between
walls
there
were
so
splendidly
symmetrical
that
time
after
time
the
enraptured
eye
stole
along
them
as
over
a
beloved
form
as
with
all
inca
architecture
everything
doors
in
size
toward
the
top
at
about
the
slope
of
the
surrounding
precipices
carrying
the
mind
back
to
karnak
and
the
ruins
of
the
nile
every
possible
or
and
was
made
full
use
of
and
the
eye
at
times
hardly
detects
where
the
building
of
nature
leaves
off
and
the
planning
of
man
begins
hidden
away
from
the
iconoclastic
spaniards
and
so
far
distant
from
the
dwellings
of
his
effete
descendants
that
transportation
of
its
blocks
for
their
own
botching
is
impossible
machu
picchu
has
escaped
the
common
fate
of
the
other
ruins
of
the
andes
and
remains
a
city
intact
like
pompeii
as
genuine
as
when
its
inhabitants
abandoned
it
carrying
off
perhaps
their
household
gods
and
the
revered
remains
of
their
ancestors
but
for
the
missing
roof
scores
of
buildings
are
as
well
preserved
as
on
the
day
their
dwellers
departed
windowed
both
humboldt
and
prescott
deny
the
existence
of
gables
or
windows
in
ancient
everywhere
peaked
above
the
general
level
sometimes
still
bearing
the
stump
of
a
great
tree
the
roots
of
which
had
curled
and
twined
in
among
the
stones
wherever
a
handful
of
soil
was
to
be
found
to
feed
upon
the
ruins
seemed
to
sprout
flowers
and
trees
giants
of
the
forest
grew
wherever
there
was
a
suggestion
of
foothold
with
a
jewish
persistency
they
had
crowded
in
between
apparently
inseparable
stone
blocks
great
trees
had
sprung
up
and
grown
to
man
s
estate
in
unbelievable
places
on
the
very
peaks
of
frail
stone
gables
even
out
from
between
the
still
granite
boulders
the
task
of
los
yanquis
had
been
no
sinecure
they
had
felled
an
entire
tropical
forest
with
giant
trees
a
century
old
the
charred
trunks
of
a
few
of
which
lay
as
they
had
fallen
like
gluttonous
bandits
overtaken
at
their
stolen
feast
convenient
stairways
now
from
one
terrace
to
another
but
much
care
had
been
necessary
many
a
stump
must
be
left
where
it
stood
for
even
to
attempt
its
removal
would
frequently
have
brought
down
half
the
structure
it
grew
in
besides
clearing
it
of
the
concealing
vegetation
the
americans
had
dug
away
in
places
several
feet
of
soil
and
had
presented
at
last
the
entire
city
with
its
alignment
of
streets
its
baths
temples
palaces
and
blocks
of
dwellings
the
finest
ruins
of
the
western
hemisphere
the
mystery
of
this
city
of
the
unpeopled
wilderness
trebles
its
fascination
how
could
such
a
place
have
completely
eluded
the
foraging
spaniards
how
could
long
centuries
have
passed
during
which
ollantaytambo
was
accepted
as
the
last
monument
of
importance
in
the
valley
of
the
urubamba
but
just
then
a
cry
of
cancha
unu
from
martinelli
who
affected
quichua
since
he
found
i
had
some
knowledge
of
it
brought
me
tearing
back
through
the
undergrowth
to
the
roof
on
legs
back
along
one
of
the
terraces
a
trickling
supply
of
water
had
been
found
and
now
we
might
take
time
to
view
the
ruins
more
leisurely
we
concocted
a
lunch
and
sent
to
carry
our
possessions
to
a
sacred
cave
among
the
palaces
the
town
centers
about
the
main
plaza
with
its
splendid
temple
backed
by
the
priest
s
dwelling
with
the
sacred
hill
piled
up
behind
it
here
too
is
the
temple
of
the
three
windows
so
unusual
a
feature
of
prehistoric
peruvian
architecture
that
the
chief
of
the
excavators
connects
it
with
the
tradition
of
the
three
brothers
who
came
out
of
as
many
windows
to
found
the
empire
of
the
incas
al
principio
del
mundo
as
garsilaso
puts
it
in
the
beginning
of
the
world
say
the
indians
who
live
to
the
east
and
north
of
the
city
of
cuzco
three
brothers
sallied
forth
through
some
windows
in
some
rocks
which
they
called
royal
certainly
if
this
is
the
original
tampu
tocco
from
which
came
the
founders
of
the
empire
they
improved
little
in
their
building
during
the
long
years
between
machu
picchu
and
the
construction
of
cuzco
its
sponsor
considers
the
city
a
thousand
years
old
yet
though
the
virile
simplicity
of
its
construction
is
untouched
by
the
beginning
of
that
ornateness
that
marks
decadence
in
all
civilizations
there
is
something
of
delicacy
and
artistic
splendor
even
amid
a
curious
mixture
of
the
crude
and
primitive
that
does
not
seem
to
bespeak
an
older
and
people
than
the
builders
of
cuzco
the
long
solid
walls
are
broken
as
in
most
inca
structures
by
niches
large
and
small
mere
shallow
closets
without
doors
with
cylindrical
projecting
stones
alternating
between
them
these
have
been
fancied
among
other
things
to
have
wardrobes
and
hooks
for
clothing
but
the
habit
of
their
descendants
suggest
that
the
builders
were
content
to
hang
their
garments
on
the
floor
though
larger
than
the
average
andean
dwelling
of
houses
of
more
than
one
room
are
rare
the
ancient
peruvians
were
evidently
as
indifferent
to
lack
of
privacy
as
their
modern
successors
along
the
walls
are
stone
couches
as
comfortable
as
those
of
mud
which
the
weary
traveler
is
fortunate
to
find
in
the
houses
of
the
interior
to
this
day
they
probably
had
as
little
furniture
as
their
descendants
and
the
host
of
long
ago
no
doubt
greeted
his
guest
with
that
selfsame
tome
asiento
be
seated
and
a
wave
of
the
hand
toward
a
block
of
wood
or
a
sharp
corner
of
stone
they
lived
apparently
more
thickly
than
in
any
modern
and
the
problem
of
increase
of
population
must
have
been
acute
was
it
this
internal
pressure
that
forced
them
finally
to
abandon
their
eagle
every
square
foot
of
ground
was
utilized
the
rooms
densely
crowded
together
with
even
subterranean
dwellings
and
long
rows
of
houses
stand
steeply
one
above
the
other
on
the
swift
precipices
of
the
city
for
all
its
ups

it
was
next
to
impossible
to
go

common
to
this
ingenious

have

rare
as

of

even
los

found
no
ruins

the

using
the
word
broadly
showed
an
extraordinary
liking
for
building
where
they
had
an
unbroken
outlook
over
all
the
surrounding
world
lovers
of
nature
perhaps
though
the
apparently
complete
indifference
of
their
descendants
to
its
charms
and
moods
makes
this
debatable
they
were
above
all
practical
fellows
moved
less
by
esthetic
reasons
than
by
an
overwhelming
dislike
of
being
awakened
from

afternoon

by

had
their

been
unrivaled

could
scarcely
have
been
improved

faint
idea
of
the
unique
charm
of
the
place
men
not
merely
of
iron
will
and
endless
patience
they
must
also
have
had
a
fixed
and
unchanging
policy
for
generations
for
with
such
tools
as
they
possessed
it
is
inconceivable
that
they
could
have
built
machu
picchu
in
less
than
a
century
not
even
their
ambitionless
descendants
of
have
less
of
the
wanderlust
than
they
and
what
a
conviction
of
the
perpetual
endurance
of
the
status
quo
was
theirs
to
take
such
infinite
pains
in
their
building
that
they
need
not
even
be
repaired
for
centuries
were
they
driven
out
by
the
fierce
aymarás
from
the
south
or
by
the
dreaded
the
breechless
tribes
from
the
below
which
the
meek
indian
of
the
highlands
fears
to
this
day
were
they
suddenly
wiped
out
by
an
epidemic
or
did
they
gather
strength
and
courage
after
centuries
of
hiding
in
this
lofty
nest
and
sally
forth
with
the
avowed
intention
of
conquering
the
world
perhaps
to
be
destroyed
and
the
secret
of
their
city
with
them
every
traveler
knows
how
isolated
groups
of
men
gradually
come
to
fancy
themselves
superior
to
all
the
rest
of
the
universe
whatever
the
cause
of
the
migration
it
must
have
taken
stern
renunciation
to
leave
behind
so
much
of
the
work
of
themselves
and
their
ancestors
i
was
aroused
from
my
musings
by
a
crashing
in
the
jungle
and
the
professor
hailed
me
with
wait
i
want
your
advice
it
was
that
awful
bite
on
the
knuckle
again
by
this
time
it
had
grown
to
nearly
the
size
of
the
second
letter
of
this
word
was
a
pale
red
in
color
and
about
it
was
a
swelling
that
could
plainly
be
seen
under
a
microscope
or
without
one
by
a
man
with
good
eyes
and
a
badly
worried
imagination
now
of
course
this
might
not
turn
out
to
be
uta
said
the
victim
in
an
agitated
voice
but
if
it
should
hours
delay
might
make
all
the
difference
in
the
world
and
i
wonder
if
it
wouldn
t
be
at
least
to
go
down
now
and
get
started
back
to
i
examined
the
alarming
symptom
with
care
there
was
no
doubt
that
it
was
the
dreaded
rot
rot
in
fact
as
to
the
swelling
had
not
i
myself
more
than
once
been
so
swollen
by
tropical
insects
that
my
best
friends
would
not
have
recognized
me
in
a
moreover
i
was
not
to
be
cheated
out
of
the
night
i
had
promised
myself
in
the
abandoned
city
and
from
words
of
sympathy
and
reassurance
i
led
the
conversation
deftly
and
gently
back
through
the
mention
of
the
professor
s
large
policy
to
the
dangers
of
life
here
in
the
days
of
the
incas
who
had
not
even
those
sops
to
make
existence
bearable
until
the
terror
of
the
tropics
inherent
in
all
men
of
the
temperate
zone
was
buried
beneath
the
fascinating
mystery
of
the
fathomless
past
the
earth
offers
few
such
views
as
that
from
the
the
place
where
the
sun
was
tied
at
the
top
of
the
town
there
the
great
topping
boulder
has
been
carved
into
an
upright
shaft
of
stone
of
symbolic
sacredness
no
doubt
in
those
bygone
days
when
the
people
of
peru
made
the
error
of
worshipping
the
sun
instead
of
bowing
down
before
wooden
images
though
it
looks
as
much
like
a
as
a
the
scene
is
best
enjoyed
alone
the
intrusion
of
modern
man
seems
to
break
the
spell
and
the
imagination
halts
lamely
in
its
striving
to
build
up
the
past
literally
at
my
feet
the
world
dropped
away
sheer
to
the
urubamba
like
a
copper
thread
all
but
encircling
the
entire
city
with
what
is
virtually
one
precipice
the
altitude
of
machu
picchu
is
put
at
feet
and
that
of
the
river
at
less
yet
it
is
surprising
how
distinctly
the
roar
of
the
stream
comes
up
to
the
very
top
of
the
invulnerable
city
utterly
unpeopled
the
visible
world
is
one
tumbled
mass
of
gigantic
mountains
rolling
away
to
inaccessible
ranges
rising
afar
off
to
crests
mingled
with
the
sky
here
are
not
the
haggard
and
sterile
andes
of
elsewhere
but
softened
undulating
forms
so
densely
wooded
that
nowhere
is
a
spot
of
earth
visible
swing
round
the
circle
and
on
the
other
side
the
gaze
falls
as
precipitously
into
the
urubamba
there
three
great
ranges
rise
one
behind
another
fading
from
blue
to
the
purple
of
vast
distances
until
the
icy
wall
of
the
central
cordillera
shuts
off
all
the
world
beyond
in
another
direction
the
rolling
purple
ranges
die
enticingly
away
one
beyond
the
other
into
the
great
and
the
of
the
amazon
while
masses
of
pure
white
clouds
come
floating
majestically
up
out
of
brazil
beyond
one
regrets
having
to
return
as
he
came
always
a
misfortune
and
the
gaze
falls
again
to
the
hoarse
thread
of
river
below
watching
it
wind
away
into
the
mystery
of
the
unknown
to
break
through
the
central
range
beyond
where
the
eye
loses
it
and
so
on
away
away
but
the
chief
hardship
of
travel
is
renunciation
here
in
what
is
the
home
only
of
the
condor
one
may
muse
but
muse
in
vain
on
the
history
of
machu
picchu
a
thousand
years
old
and
a
thousand
years
hence
it
will
still
be
here
why
is
man
of
such
perishable
stuff
that
mere
rocks
and
stones
may
laugh
at
the
brevity
of
his
existence
if
only
one
could
call
back
the
ancient
inhabitants
to
tell
their
story
did
they
build
so
long
before
the
conquest
that
the
city
was
already
overgrown
and
forgotten
when
the
bearded
centaurs
first
appeared
to
startle
and
undo
their
descendants
or
was
this
some
secret
holy
spot
the
indians
concealed
by
silence
even
from
the
garrulous
descendant
of
huayna
ccápac
were
its
existence
known
to
them
why
did
not
tupac
amaru
and
his
followers
set
up
a
defence
here
against
the
spaniards
for
even
in
those
days
the
place
would
have
been
invulnerable
against
anything
but
treachery
from
within
however
baffling
its
story
it
is
not
difficult
for
one
who
has
wandered
along
the
andes
to
build
up
a
picture
of
the
living
city
of
the
past
as
he
sits
here
in
the
declining
day
lulled
yet
excited
by
the
ceaseless
music
of
the
urubamba
far
below
mysterious
in
its
impassiveness
as
if
it
knew
but
were
sworn
forever
to
guard
the
secret
it
has
girdled
with
its
impregnable
precipices
for
unknown
centuries
before
the
inner
eye
the
many
stone
stairways
take
on
life
up
and
down
them
move
unhurriedly
yet
actively
men
and
women
with
broad
faces
noiseless
in
their
bare
feet
their
garments
a
constant
interweaving
of
many
bright
colors
the
hundreds
of
peaked
gables
take
on
roofs
of
thatch
symmetrical
carefully
made
perhaps
with
decorated
ceilings
within
at
least
in
the
temples
and
palaces
llamas
step
silently
through
the
narrow
streets
gazing
with
haughty
dreaminess
about
them
from
all
the
crowded
city
rises
the
hum
of
busy
bucolic
life
yet
not
noisily
for
the
general
tone
is
peaceful
industry
and
a
phlegmatic
preoccupation
now
and
again
the
hollow
boom
of
a
wooden
gong
rises
and
dies
away
in
one
of
the
sacred
temples
as
the
shadows
lengthen
workmen
a
cheek
swollen
with
a
cud
of
coca
mount
up
the
breakneck
terraces
below
waving
with
indian
corn
or
purple
with
pass
silently
along
the
brow
of
the
intihuatana
hill
and
hurry
unhurriedly
on
to
their
huts
in
the
crowded
outskirts
a
greater
hush
than
before
falls
on
all
the
scene
except
for
the
voice
of
the
urubamba
as
the
inca
majestic
of
mien
the
royal
about
his
forehead
attended
a
certain
distance
by
respectful
nobles
bearing
the
symbolic
burden
on
their
shoulders
mounts
to
the
sacred
rock
there
alone
or
attended
at
respectful
aloofness
only
by
the
of
the
little
temple
behind
he
watches
the
god
of
the
peruvians
of
old
sink
swiftly
as
it
was
sinking
now
behind
the
snow
range
that
stands
out
cold
and
clear
to
the
west
and
sees
the
labyrinth
of
shaggy
wooded
ranges
beyond
the
bottomless
void
below
melt
and
merge
into
one
common
whole
off
in
a
corner
of
the
city
on
the
brow
of
the
headlong
precipice
comes
faintly
to
the
imperial
ears
the
sound
of
stone
striking
stone
where
the
miscreant
sentenced
that
day
to
carve
a
new
seat
in
an
boulder
before
the
coming
of
the
new
moon
plies
his
task
with
full
darkness
even
this
ceases
the
faint
of
the
die
away
and
before
the
night
is
an
hour
old
the
entire
city
is
sunk
in
slumber
save
only
the
watchmen
in
their
towers
and
aeries
behind
and
above
and
along
the
city
wall
in
the
hollow
beneath
from
these
come
faint
glows
to
punctuate
the
darkness
of
the
andean
night
then
nothing

from

the

rumiñaui
seated
on
the
or
at
the
top
of
the
town
from
which
the
world
falls
away
a
sheer
feet
to
the
urubamba
below
martinelli
was
inclined
to
sleep
in
the
sacred
cave
under
the
circular
tower
to
this
the
professor
objected
as
too
snaky
and
they
compromised
on
the
long
stone
bench
above
near
the
finest
wall
in
machu
picchu
when
they
were
settled
i
piled
my
bedding
on
the
back
of
rumiñaui
and
drove
him
away
into
the
humid
darkness
sailing
under
sealed
orders
he
tore
his
way
fearfully
through
the
undergrowth
that
clutched
at
him
with
a
thousand
unseen
fingers
down
through
the
heart
of
the
town
and
across
the
sacred
plaza
its
three
great
windows
staring
all
but
invisible
at
us
in
the
night
on
i
pursued
the
trembling
wretch
into
the
the
most
imposing
structure
of
machu
picchu
and
three
times
bade
him
pile
his
load
up
on
the
stone
altar
before
he
would
believe
his
ears
when
i
murmured
illimni
all
right
he
turned
tail
and
fled
so
suddenly
that
he
forgot
even
the
customary
above
below
and
all
about
me
the
night
was
chanting
its
mysterious
pagan
song
the
distant
roar
of
the
urubamba
came
up
clear
and
sharp
in
the
sky
above
myriad
stars
shone
forth
with
that
unusual
brightness
of
upper
heights
the
rest
was
blackness
i
cleared
away
a
few
plants
and
parasites
from
the
altar
and
the
niches
above
it
was
an
immense
fourteen
feet
long
and
five
high
but
a
bare
three
feet
wide
and
a
long
drop
for
an
uneasy
sleeper
i
rolled
out
and
ponchos
to
form
the
bed
of
many
an
andean
night
then
unconsciously
in
an
instant
i
solved
the
niche
problem
that
has
been
harassing
peruvian
antiquarians
for
centuries
nothing
could
be
simpler
the
bygone
race
broke
the
long
surfaces
of
their
walls
with
these
neither
as
settings
for
their
idols
nor
as
stations
for
their
guards
but
as
convenient
places
in
which
to
lay
their
leggings
hobnailed
boots
and
tin
watches
for
the
night
i
am
by
no
means
the
only
one
who
will
be
glad
to
have
the
problem
solved
at
last
it
would
have
been
easy
for
the
high
priest
to
have
dropped
in
on
me
during
the
night
or
to
have
sent
his
henchmen
to
do
likewise
with
a
few
rocks
and
boulders
even
if
he
could
not
have
arranged
for
me
a
dance
of
his
private
especially
as
the
temple
is
now
roofless
but
i
slept
the
night
through
monotonously
undisturbed
waking
only
once
to
congratulate
myself
on
being
so
far
removed
from
the
disturbing
living
world
and
falling
asleep
again
without
even
feeling
to
find
whether
my
revolver
still
hung
within
easy
reach
long
wilderness
travel
seems
to
develop
in
the
nostrils
a
power
to
scent
the
dawn
i
had
finished
dressing
when
the
night
began
to
pale
along
its
eastern
rim
and
striding
away
through
the
jungle
and
down
the
great
central
stone
stairway
i
came
upon
the
professor
and
martinelli
huddled
together
end
to
end
on
their
roofless
stone
couch
snoring
oblivious
of
the
fact
that
the
daylight
in
which
no
true
traveler
sleeps
had
already
come
the
opportunity
for
correction
was
too
precious
to
lose
close
beside
them
i
drew
my
revolver
and
fired
a
roaring
shot
into
the
rosy
dawn
overhead
mere
words
are
powerless
to
picture
the
slothful
pair
as
they
exploded
forth
from
their
coverings
with
the
rampant
hair
and
eyes
of
puritans
suddenly
fallen
upon
by
a
band
of
indians
in
the
good
old
days
when
puritans
were
fair
prey
in
the
sacred
cave
below
i
found
rumiñaui
also
sitting
up
in
his
bed
scratching
the
sleep
out
of
his
eyes
and
having
sent
him
for
my
possessions
set
to
boiling
coffee
while
listening
to
the
sad
story
of
my
companions
barely
had
i
left
them
to
their
own
protection
the
evening
before
when
martinelli
thought
he
felt
a
snake
strike
his
boot
and
shouted
in
alarm
by
morning
light
he
found
a
had
pricked
him
through
the
leather
then
rumiñaui
had
come
with
a
long
and
dolorous
quichua
tale
of
the
tribes
of
víboras
that
had
their
nests
in
the
interstices
of
the
wall
beside
and
above
them
and
only
awaited
the
stillness
of
the
night
to
sally
forth
on
their
deadly
errands
this
in
turn
recalled
to
the
professor
that
the
circular
were
in
this
very
building
and
caused
him
to
scrunch
down
head
and
all
into
his
hoping
against
hope
that
no
deadly
viper
could
bite
through
its
several
thicknesses
to
make
life
even
more
miserable
another
gnat
had
stung
him
on
another
knuckle
voracious
creature
evidently
so
bent
on
destruction
that
it
had
made
a
special
trip
up
from
the
valley
below
for
this
nefarious
purpose
since
insects
do
not
commonly
inhabit
machu
picchu
now
it
might
be
that
the
first
bite
had
not
injected
the
dread
but
surely
no
ordinary
man
could
hope
to
survive
a
second
so
that
all
the
bitter
night
through
the
professor
more
exactly
and
motionless
within
his
on
the
extreme
outer
edge
of
the
stone
divan
as
far
as
possible
from
the
viperous
wall
yet
always
in
fear
of
taking
the
awful
drop
to
the
reptilian
ground
beneath
while
before
his
sunken
eyes
passed
in
cinematographic
succession
the
picture
of
the
dread
rot
he
could
distinctly
feel
creeping
and
crawling
through
all
his
frame
devouring
it
limb
by
limb
feature
by
feature
the
awful
news
seeping
out
into
the
middle
west
that
one
of
his
most
cherished
citizens
had
been
brought
to
grief
by
a
mere
insect
of
the
andes
but
enough
of
the
harrowing
details
yet
the
worst
is
still
to
be
heard
all
the
endless
night
through
things
kept
dropping
down
upon
the
sleepers
from
the
wall
above
to
my
unromantic
mind
these
were
bits
of
twigs
and
leaves
yet
in
the
subtle
silence
of
the
tropical
night
small
wonder
each
was
a
possible
to
the
sufferer
within
the
assuring
himself
a
thousand
times
that
no
viper
could
bite
through
it
yet
lacking
faith
in
his
own
assurance
the
most
anguishing
moment
of
all
was
that
when
there
dropped
squarely
upon
him
with
a
soft
thud
something
that
proved
by
daylight
that
he
had
hung
carelessly
in
the
incaic
niche
above
one
of
his
woolen
socks
the
descent
was
harder
than
the
climb
also
it
was
quicker
so
slippery
was
the
wet
trail
at
that
angle
that
whenever
our
heels
failed
to
bite
into
the
soil
we
sat
down
emphatically
on
the
backs
of
our
necks
some
feet
further
down
the
slope
fetching
it
a
resounding
wallop
with
the
rest
of
the
body
there
is
talk
of
some
day
building
an
electric
line
from
cuzco
and
a
funicular
up
to
the
ruins
with
perhaps
a
tourist
hotel
among
them
fortunately
talk
does
not
easily
breed
action
in
peru
one
of
the
chief
charms
of
machu
picchu
is
inherent
in
the
difficulty
of
reaching
it
a
scene
once
made
accessible
to
fat
ladies
is
ready
to
be
marked
off
the
traveler
s
itinerary
and
to
be
turned
over
to
the
tender
mercies
of
the
tourist
we
ended
the
descent
without
broken
bones
though
not
without
shattered
tempers
and
finding
the
precarious
connection
with
the
outer
world
still
sagging
between
the
roaring
boulders
climbed
the
wet
jungled
bank
beyond
here
rumiñaui
in
addition
to
his
regular
government
wage
of
twenty
cents
was
rewarded
with
a
shilling
and
a
handful
of
only
the
latter
seeming
to
be
of
any
interest
to
him
and
here
strangely
enough
tomás
was
waiting
as
he
had
been
ordered
with
the
four
animals
their
heads
turned
toward
cuzco

on
november
i
took
train
southward
though
my
original
plan
of
following
the
inca
highway
from
quito
to
cuzco
had
been
accomplished
the
thought
of
turning
homeward
with
half
the
continent
still
unexplored
had
become
an
absurdity
but
the
scattered
life
of
that
dreary
region
to
the
south
of
the
imperial
city
promised
too
little
of
new
interest
to
be
worth
covering
on
foot
if
i
did
walk
down
to
the
station
behind
my
belongings
on
jogging

it
was
because
to
have
waited
for
the
nine

would
probably
have
been
to
miss
the

its
rival

with
the

at

and
another
at

whence
a
branch
descends
to

every
friday
there
is
a
vertiginous
express
that
makes
puno
in
one
day
a
fertile
valley
the
great
or
mountain
pocket
that
stretches
from
the
pampa
of
anta
in
the
north
to
urcos
on
the
south
with
many
grazing
cattle
frequent
villages
and
strings
of
laden
indians
and
asses
rolled
slowly
past
before
noon
we
caught
the
gorge
of
the
muddy
vilcañota
the
same
stream
that
under
the
name
of
urubamba
encircles
machu
picchu
with
little
far
up
the
face
of
the
enclosing
ranges
and
here
and
there
steep
narrow
side
valleys
rich
with
cultivation
yet
cultivatable
ground
was
scarce
so
scarce
that
it
was
easy
to
understand
why
the
ancient
population
spared
as
much
of
it
as
possible
by
walling
up
their
dead
in
caves
and
planting
all
but
perpendicular
slopes
next
day
the
valley
rose
gradually
until
cultivation
gave
way
completely
to
cattle
and
sheep
then
to
llama
and
alpaca
herds
grazing
on
the
tough
ichu
of
broad
punas
stretching
to
arid
foothills
that
in
turn
rolled
up
into
a
great
range
on
our
left
an
aggressive
despairing
aridity
rarely
touched
with
a
cheering
note
of
green
spread
in
every
direction
a
dreary
land
indeed
would
this
have
been
to
journey
through
afoot
small
wonder
the
race
accustomed
always
to
this
desolate
landscape
is
of
melancholy
temperament
given
to
personifying
nature
as
a
host
of
evil
spirits
inimical
to
man
the
drear
and
barren
land
across
which
lay
the
branch
line
of
the
third
day
rolled
ever
higher
to
the
crucero
alto
at
feet
two
large
lakes
cold
in
tint
with
a
few
barren
islands
broke
upon
the
scene
and
sank
slowly
as
we
panted
upward
patches
of
snow
lay
above
around
and
then
below
us
the
glare
of
the
arid
landscape
grew
painful
to
the
eyes
recalling
that
many
an
andean
traveler
holds
colored
glasses
an
indispensable
part
of
his
equipment
towns
there
were
none
and
the
stations
consisted
of
one
or
two
buildings
of
stone
or
dismal
beyond
conception
then
we
descended
gradually
here
and
there
in
the
edge
of
reedy
lagoons
stood
birds
the
feathers
of
which
in
olden
days
formed
the
inca
s
when
capital
punishment
was
meted
out
to
anyone
of
lesser
rank
who
dared
decorate
himself
with
them
equally
sacred
were
the
the
undomesticated
species
of
the
llama
family
that
furnished
the
imperial
ermine
ordinarily
the
traveler
is
fortunate
to
catch
sight
from
the
train
of
one
or
two
of
those
timid
animals
a
group
of
fourteen
appeared
not
five
hundred
yards
away
across
the
pampa
then
within
an
hour
we
passed
close
by
flocks
of
nine
twelve
seven
and
eight
respectively
a
total
of
fifty
more
than
my
peruvian
who
crossed
this
line
several
times
a
year
had
seen
in
all
his
life
unlike
the
three
domesticated
species
llama
alpaca
and
guanaco
the
vicuñas
are
uniform
in
color
a
with
whitish
belly
legs
and
tail
not
unlike
a
fawn
in
general
appearance
a
more
delicate
animal
could
scarcely
be
imagined
the
neck
seemed
hardly
larger
than
a
man
s
wrist
the
legs
fragile
in
their
slender
daintiness
they
were
graceful
as
well
as
swift
even
in
their
running
which
resembled
the
gait
of
the
in
the
way
they
brought
front
and
hind
legs
together
the
flocks
still
belong
to
the
government
as
in
the
days
of
the
incas
when
they
were
protected
by
royal
edict
under
penalty
of
death
for
some
ten
years
past
peruvian
law
too
has
forbidden
killing
them
but
the
valuable
wool
and
skins
are
still
to
be
had
in
the
larger
cities
for
are
conspicuous
by
their
absence
what
seemed
a
hopeless
desert
thinly
covered
with
dry
wiry
now
spread
in
all
directions
we
were
crossing
the
vast
pampa
de
arguelles
so
named
from
the
family
that
has
leased
hundreds
of
square
miles
of
it
from

government

the
indians
permission
to
graze
their
cattle

a

for

animals
twice
that
for

to
permit
the

to
live
on

as
of
rivers
flowing

appeared
now
and
then
across
the
arid
immensity
at
stations
lay
piled
great
heaps
of
a
fuel
resembling
a
cross
between
peat
and
giant
mushrooms
further
down

scraggly
bush

cut
for
the
same
purpose
and
carried
in

on

soon
that
dreary
sahara
of
the
west
coast
lay
on
every
hand
massive
rocks
piled
up
fantastically
monotonous
to
the
last
degree
yet
not
without
a
certain
striking
beauty
under
some
moods
the
landscape
was
what
the
germans
call
of
a
rich
dusted
by
the
winds
and
bleached
by
the
suns
of
centuries
and
spreading
away
to
infinity
with
a
hint
of
the
vastness
of
the
earth
which
even
the
sea
does
not
give
suddenly
a
patch
of
alfalfa
burst
out
among
the
glaring
rocks
trebling
their
barrenness
by
contrast
it
was
the
little
oasis
of
yura
fed
by
a
small
stream
the
water
of
which
reputed
efficacious
to
disordered
livers
is
bottled
and
widely
than
before

priests
whose
rival
establishment

water

to
blackball
out
of

anyone
who
drank

far
away
across
the
world
the
eye
made
out
well
below
at
first
dimly
a
green
oasis
with
a
great
or
at
least
a
widespread
city
covering
about
half
of
it
ari
quepay
yes
let
us
stay
a
while
the
first
settlers
are
said
to
have
cried
when
they
caught
sight
of
this
garden
spot
and
the
train
seemed
setting
us
down
at
last
in
arequipa
second
city
of
peru
three
dawdling
days
had
been
required
to
cover
miles
the
only
place
of
importance
between
the
pacific
and
titicaca
is
strikingly
oriental
in
atmosphere
with
a
suggestion
of
cairo
thanks
to
its
shuffling
hole
is
slit
in
their
nostrils
that
they
may
more
easily
breathe
this
highland
its
encircling
desert

exceeding
the

beauty
by
reason
of
the
snowclads
hovering
about

by

from

the

away
as
from
the
summit
of
the

to
a
horizon
far
more
broken
and
tumbled
than
that
of
the
sahara
the
hills
are
streaked
with
what
looks
like
snow
but
is
really
fine
sand
the
same
sand
that
lies
in
waves
monotonously
multiplied
in
the
form
of
wandering
nearer
the
coast
whence
quantities
of
it
are
shipped
to

to
make
a

pastures
in
an
oasis
where
irrigation
produces
alfalfa
as
well
as
many
fruits
in
abundance
the
desert
air
is
clear
beyond
words
bringing
the
newcomer
from
the
bleak
highlands
above
the
impression
that
summer
an
unoppressive
midsummer
of
the
north
has
suddenly
come
again
every
evening
wonderful
sunsets
ranging
from
lurid
pink

across
the
surrounding
desert
world
the
city
itself
is
flat
of
one
or
at
most
two
stories
always
with
the
bulking
mass
of
misti
or
its
neighbors
behind
it
earthquakes
have
been
frequent
in
arequipa
because
of
these
visitations
perhaps
the
town
has
everywhere
an
unfinished
appearance
most
buildings
ceasing
abruptly
just
above
the
first
story
and
looking
as
if
the
rest
had
been
shaken
off
or
suddenly
abandoned
a
few
have
ventured
to
crawl
up
again
to
two
stories
and
here
and
there
a
bold
adventurer
to
three
these
latter
commonly
of
seeming
constantly
to
tremble
at
their
own
temerity
as
in
lima
and
the
lands
of
the
arab
the
roofs
are
flat
places
of
promenade
and
evening
for
rain
falls
if
at
all
only
in
brief
afternoon
showers
the
town
is
built
largely
of
a
soft
white
stone
almost
chalk
in
composition
and
light
in
weight
as
which
is
chopped
or
sawed
out
of
a
desert
quarry
not
far
away
and
which
though
it
hardens
in
the
air
can
still
be
carved
with
a
knife
two
arched
bridges
with
massive
piers
mildly
suggesting
those
by
which
one
enters
toledo
in
spain
span
the
little
chili
the
eucalyptus
seems
less
at
home
here
than
in
the
higher
cities
of
the
sierra
but
drooping
willows
abound
as
everywhere
on
the
west
coast
of
peru
massive
mud
fences
afford
places
of
promenade
in
the
outskirts
i
was
treading
close
on
the
heels
of
civilization
of
a
material
sort
electric
had
appeared
in
arequipa
a
bare
three
months
before
with
motormen
imported
from
lima
they
afforded
an
efficient
service
to
nearly
every
corner
of
the
oasis
the
innovation
had
not
been
without
its
difficulties
strolling
one
morning
i
met
three
cholos
driving
a
dozen
donkeys
marketward
suddenly
they
began
to
shout
and
dance
about
the
animals
as
if
some
danger
were
imminent
a
block
away
sounded
the
gong
of
a
bright
new
tramcar
but
as
i
had
never
known
one
least
of
all
in
south
america
deliberately
to
run
down
an
animal
i
wondered
at
the
uproar
to
my
surprise
the
car
came
on
without
slackening
speed
the
shrieking
cholos
succeeded
in
hauling
pushing
or
coaxing
most
of
the
stubborn
brutes
off
the
line
but
one
pair
refused
to
vary
their
set
course
at
the
last
moment
one
of
these
lost
courage
and
sidestepped
but
his
sturdy
black
companion
kept
serenely
on
with
stubborn
ears
and
a
flip
of
the
just
then
a
corner
of
the
swiftly
moving
car
caught
him
on
the
starboard
beam
he
turned
a
complete
somersault
on
the
cobbles
rolled
on
to
his
feet
and
gazed
after
the
still
speeding
car
with
a
scowl
not
unmixed
with
a
ludicrous
expression
of
astonishment
later
i
learned
from
the
american
manager
of
the
line
that
a
number
of
donkeys
burritos
and
dogs
had
been
killed
during
the
first
month
of
operation
decrees
and
warnings
had
been
utterly
wasted
and
arequipa
s
donkeys
would
have
stagnated
the
lines
and
again
taken
possession
of
the
gait
of
life
without
this
resort
to
the
teaching
of
experience
cuzco
and
arequipa
are
reputed
the
peruvian
strongholds
of
conservatism
of
the
two
the
latter
is
probably
more
deeply
under
the
spell
of
the
ancient
church
the
din
of
bells
was
almost
constant
during
my
week
in
the
city
i
saw
no
fewer
than
five
images
of
the
virgin
paraded
through
the
streets
to
the
usual
accompaniment
of
kneeling
cholos
bareheaded
whites
and
scores
of
old
beatas
following
with
funereal
step
several
of
arequipa
s
fiestas
are
noted
for
the
dancing
of
wooden
saints
to
barbaric
music
in
the
public
squares
others
have
fixed
periods
of
calling
on
their
fellows
sallying
forth
from
their
home
churches
to
the
plaza
where
manipulated
by
the
cholo
bearers
beneath
they
bow
to
and
finally
kiss
each
other
to
the
fanatical
applause
of
the
multitude
the
town
boasts
also
several
crucified
figures
operated
by
wires
that
cause
the
eyes
to
roll
the
limbs
to
quiver
and
the
head
finally
to
droop
as
in
death
after
which
a
gang
of
workmen
carrying
towels
over
their
arms
to
wipe
away
the
blood
climb
up
to
remove
the
nails
and
lay
the
body
of
jesus
away
in
a
glass
coffin

next

arequipa
is
built
of
stones
light
as
wood
cut
from
a
neighboring
quarry
they
harden
when
exposed
to
the
air
from
a
score
of
stories
typical
of
arequipa
with
which
i
was
favored
by
a
who
had
spent
many
years
as
the
alpaca
expert
of
the
chief
local
warehouse
i
pass
on
two
for
months
he
and
his
wife
had
been
annoyed
by
the
throngs
of
beggars
who
gathered
for
a
bowl
of
soup
each
noon
at
the
monastery
just
across
the
narrow
street
from
his
residence
and
then
slept
out
the
day
in
the
sandy
hollows
nearby
like
the
dogs
of
constantinople
what
particularly
aroused
his
ire
were
the
habits
of
an
old
fellow
of
ninety
or
so
whom
he
had
known
for
years
a
few
weeks
before
finding
him
in
the
all
too
scanty
remnants
of
what
had
once
been
shirt
and
trousers
the
american
had
smuggled
him
into
his
workshop
and
given
him
a
complete
new
outfit
from
his
own
wardrobe
the
mendicant
returned
to
his
customary
hollow
a
hundred
yards
up
the
street
which
he
was
accustomed
to
share
with
several
curs
and
a
donkey
or
two
and
during
the
night
his
robbed
him
of
the
new
garments
what
then
was
the
donor
s
surprise
and
american
disgust
when
he
set
out
on
his
early
stroll
next
morning
to
find
the
old
fellow
parading
up
and
down
the
street
begging
of
the
women
bound
for
mass
in
the
monastery
church
without
a
lickin
stitch
on
him
as
naked
as
the
day
he
was
born
if
you
d
tell
it
in
the
states
they
d
say
you
was
lyin
and
that
he
must
have
had
a
shirt
an
britches
on
anyway
but
no
sir
just
as
i
m
telling
you
without
a
lickin
stitch
an
parading
his
wrinkled
old
carcass
up
an
down
amongst
all
them
women
goin
to
but
the
ladies
seemed
merely
to
be
mildly
amused
and
the
native
policeman
saw
nothing
in
the
sight
worthy
of
comment
children
now
and
then
roam
the
streets
of
arequipa
in
their
birthday
clothes
and
the
old
fellow
had
long
since
been
in
his
second
childhood
my
outraged
went
across
town
to
make
complaint
to
his
friend
the
prefect
the
latter
did
not
see
what
he
could
do
about
it
why
don
t
you
send
him
to
the
hospital
grumbled
the
they
wouldn
t
receive
him
with
no
one
to
pay
for
his
well
sir
i
couldn
t
stand
it
no
longer
having
that
ol
feller
paradin
around
before
my
house
with
my
wife
inside
an
all
of
them
women
folks
goin
to
mass
as
naked
as

until

an
when

opened
the
street
door
in
tumbles
a
woman
that
had
been
leanin
up
against
all
saints
just
fell
down
into
the
parlor
here
an
by
the
time
i
rolled
her
out
again
an
got
jayzoóse
home
i
was
sweatin
some
i
can
tell
i
strolled
out
one
afternoon
in
a
leisurely
hour
from
the
central
plaza
by
a
street
growing
ever
rougher
and
less
cobbled
to
the
harvard
observatory
on
the
flank
of
misti
with
a
splendid
view
of
the
cone
towering
into
the
sky
close
beside
it
and
a
marvelous
outlook
over
all
the
oasis
of
arequipa
here
in
a
household
where
it
was
easy
to
fancy
myself
suddenly
set
back
in
the
heart
of
my
own
land
american
scientists
photograph
the
heavens
on
large
with
exposures
of
from
one
to
eight
hours
through
telescopes
automatically
regulated
to
the
speed
of
the
earth
but
requiring
also
constant
hand
adjustment
arequipa
however
is
growing
less
ideal
for
the
purpose
since
the
number
of
its
cloudy
days
has
more
than
doubled
the
sun
was
sinking
behind
the
sahara
hills
when
i
turned
homeward
through
the
caressing
air
of
evening
the
desert
flanks
of
misti
and
chachani
and
pichapichu
glowing
a
velvety
red
from
the
reflection
of
the
opposite
horizon
the
white
oriental
city
growing
dimmer
and
dimmer
then
suddenly
bursting
out
in
a
spray
of
electric
lights
above
which
the
two
white
spires
of
the
cathedral
more
than
ever
resembled
minarets
next
day
i
returned
to
the
highlands
in
the
private
car
of
the
railway
superintendent
a
the
day
was
brilliant
the
leprous
desert
flashing
in
the
sun
even
after
it
had
given
way
to
the
tablelands
of
the
great
plateau
misti
bulking
as
large
a
hundred
kilometers
away
as
out
at
the
observatory
on
her
flanks
and
springing
up
into
the
luminous
sky
about
us
to
all
points
of
the
compass
all
the
afternoon
we
loafed
in
cushioned
armchairs
facing
the
back
platform
on
which
sat
our
host
shooting
with
automatic
at
vicuñas
a
pastime
strictly
against
the
law
but
peruvian
statutes
scarcely
reach
the
altitude
of
a
railway
superintendent
fortunately
the
animals
were
scarce
and
far
away
and
the
nearest
he
came
to
breaking
the
law
was
to
raise
the
desert
dust
about
them
and
send
them
scampering
across
the
rolling
pampa
at
a
lope
between
that
of
and
a
deer
sparing
us
the
necessity
of
halting
the
train
and
sending
out
the
crew
to
bring
in
the
game
from
juliaca
we
turned
south
along
a
flat
arms
and
branches
of
titicaca
full
of
shivering
reeds
broke
in
upon
the
dusk
that
thickened
into
night
just
as
we
pulled
into
puno
cold
dreary
and
monotonously
like
all
other
towns
of
the
high
sierra
i
had
timed
my
arrival
to
take
instead
of
the
regular
steamer
directly
across
the
lake
the
yapura
that
makes
the
round
of
its
shore
with
many
stops
we
were
off
at
ten
and
out
upon
the
open
sea
by
midnight
a
huge
distorted
moon
rising
off
the
starboard
bow
into
the
prismatic
wake
of
which
we
wheezed
slowly
but
steadily
until
it
crawled
up
under
the
black
skirts
of
the
clouds
that
covered
the
edges
of
an
otherwise
starlit
sky
a
wind
as
penetrating
as
that
off
cape
race
caused
our
diminutive
craft
to
roll
and
plunge
merrily
to
the
distress
of
the
priest
lawyer
and
with
whom
i
shared
the
titicaca
by
daylight
has
the
identical
color
of
the
sea
itself
and
we
awoke
to
find
ourselves
wheezing
along
in
so
to
speak
at
eighteen
two
or
three
hours
we
cast
anchor
first
before
the
red
town
of
juli
in
a
lap
of
bare
hills
sloping
up
from
the
lake
i
dropped
on
top
of
the
first
boatload
of
cargo
and
went
ashore
the
captain
having
orders
not
to
start
without
me
promising
to
blow
a
special
signal
the
jesuits
claim
to
have
set
up
in
juli
the
first
in
america
and
here
quichua
was
first
reduced
to
writing
it
is
a
mere
dawdling
village
distinguished
by
the
voluminous
dutchman
breeches
of
its
indians
at
noon
pomata
held
us
long
enough
to
unload
the
priest
and
a
few
boxes
and
bales
at
the
usual
cobblestone
wharf
this
same
good
padre
had
assured
me
that
it
was
a
fact
that
saint
thomas
had
visited
america
before
the
conquest
and
had
brought
the
indians
their
civilization
being
known
to
them
as
tomi
bit
familiar
to
say
the
least
how
persistently
mankind
seeks
to
rob
poor
old
columbus
of
his
glory
in
the
afternoon
we
churned
into
a
wide
semicircular
bay
as
far
as
shallow
water
and
rustling
reeds
permitted
and
i
was
soon
climbing
the
easy
slope
to
yunguyo
here
and
there
was
much
freight
to
discharge
when
i
expressed
my
surprise
at
the
consumptive
powers
of
so
small
a
town
the
captain
winked
an
eye
and
breathed
rather
than
murmured
i
had
come
at
last
to
the
end
of
endless
peru
with
the
unexpected
privilege
of
walking
out
of
it
as
i
had
entered
it
eight
months
before
yunguyo
lies
on
the
neck
of
a
little
peninsula
part
of
which
by
the
arbitrariness
of
international
frontiers
is
bolivian
the
steamer
had
orders
to
pick
me
up
in
the
morning
and
slipping
on
kodak
and
revolver
i
struck
out
for
the
sacred
city
of
copacabana
a
league
from
the
landing
the
road
mounted
a
stony
ridge
passed
through
the
two
arches
of
an
uninhabited
rural
chapel
and
left
the
historical
if
sometimes
land
of
peru
forever
behind
to
that
day
i
had
never
to
my
knowledge
met
a
bolivian
those
born
beyond
the
boundary
evidently
kept
the
fact
a
profound
secret
and
in
peru
the
silence
about
the
adjoining
land
was
as
if
it
were
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
earth
once
in
bolivia
it
was
as
rare
to
hear
anything
of
peru
it
was
a
stony
country
in
fact
there
were
more
stones
than
country
everywhere
they
lay
piled
up
in
high
massive
fences
with
patches
between
them
the
wide
road
was
with
indians
afoot
indians
darker
and
of
more
independent
mien
than
those
of
cuzco
this
was
the
route
by
which
according
to
tradition
manco
ccápac
set
out
from
the
island
of
titicaca
to
found
the
inca
empire
the
countrymen
were
engaged
in
a
sort
of
planting
and
plowing
bee
a
festival
their
hatbands
decorated
with
newly
picked
flowers
the
instant
i
passed
the
boundary
the
of
the
women
changed
to
an
ugly
round
felt
hat
hitherto
unknown
on
the
peruvian
side
the
shores
of
the
lake
had
been
reedy
and
shallow
lisping
with
and
a
melancholy
wind
from
off
titicaca
as
if
the
sea
were
thinking
sadly
of
its
lost
glory
but
as
i
topped
the
ridge
of
the
peninsula
there
opened
suddenly
before
me
the
vast
lake
as
against
the
base
of
the
hills
as
if
dug
with
some
gigantic
spade
rolling
away
in
one
direction
over
the
horizon
like
an
atlantic
the
island
of
titicaca
standing
forth
in
the
middle
distance
sharp
as
an
etching
rocks
which
the
superstitious
indians
fancy
are
impious
men
turned
to
stone
stood
forth
on
every
hand
children
along
the
way

me
as
tata
the
aymará
version
of
the
quichua
tayta
father
at
the
end
of
a
stroll
the
stony
highway
broke
forth
into
a
little
town
the
church
and
monastery
sacred
to
our
lady
of
copacabana
roofed
with
glistening
green
and
yellow
tiles
in
a
square
surrounded
by
heavy
walls
brilliant
with
the
crimson
del
nestles
in
a
lap
of
rocky
hills
a
bit
back
from
the
lake
and
bulks
high
above
the
haunts
of
mere
men
at
its
feet
in
the
days
of
the
incas
this
was
a
holy
city
with
a
certain
idol
of
vast
renown
among
the
gentiles
a
place
of
purification
whence
pilgrims
embarked
for
the
island
of
titicaca
the
church
militant
would
not
have
been
itself
had
it
lost
this
opportunity
of
grafting
its
own
superstitions
on
those
of
the
aboriginals
and
some
three
centuries
ago
the
present
virgen
de
copacabana
was
set
up
with
the
usual
marvelous
tale
of
her
miraculous
appearance
in
this
spot
her
servants
have
been
realizing
richly
on
their
foresight
ever
since
a
steady
stream
of
pilgrims
pours
into
the
holy
city
from
peru
as
well
as
bolivia
and
even
from
further
off
the
year
round
though
august
and
february
are
the
days
of
chief
festival
and
mightiest
crowds
near
the
monastery
is
a
large
a
for
pilgrims
with
a
great
rectangular
patio
opening
through
an
archway
in
the
town
roundabout
is
that
curious
atmosphere
of
a
mixture
of
piety
and
commercial
advantage
common
to
rome
jerusalem
benares
and
puree
an
air
of
something
hard
to
believe
yet
highly
advantageous
to
accept
at
least
outwardly
the
costumes
of
the
populace
had
grown
frankly
bolivian
in
several
of
the
shops
stocked
with
sacred
baubles
facing
the
immense
plaza
women
were
rolling
cigarettes
new
proof
that
i
was
in
bolivia
for
to
roll
a
cigarette
in
peru
is
the
exclusive
privilege
of
the
government
the
priest
of
pomata
had
given
me
a
note
to
the
superior
of
the
monastery
a
doorkeeper
led
me
into
pillared
cloisters
opening
on
a
patio
and
softly
into
the
sanctum
of
father
basoberri
deep
in
conversation
with
a
parish
priest
who
had
brought
a
flock
of
pilgrims
from
a
neighboring
town
being
a
european
he
created
a
better
impression
than
the
average
native
churchman
to
celebrate
my
arrival
he
ordered
a
servant
to
uncork
a
bottle
of
imported
beer
and
after
the
first
formalities
had
him
set
me
down
in
the
monastery
where
an
excellent
meal
stopped
abruptly
short
of
dessert
and
coffee
the
superior
conducted
me
in
person
to
the
large
room
reserved
for
distinguished
guests
opening
on
the
now
expanse
of
titicaca
and
advised
me
to
fasten
the
padlock
and
put
the
key
in
my
pocket
for
though
we
are
here
in
a
monastery
there
are
people
passing
back
and
forth
and
it
is
safer
now
he
went
on
if
you
wish
to
see
the
customs
of
the
pilgrims
you
have
only
to
mount
that
i
climbed
two
stone
flights
in
and
found
myself
in
a
narrow
wooden
gallery
at
the
back
of
a
large
high
chamber
suffused
with
a
dim
religious
it
was
painted
blue
with
a
sprinkling
of
golden
stars
as
nearly
the
painter
s
visualization
of
heaven
no
doubt
as
the
crudity
of
his
workmanship
permitted
him
to
express
confession
and
a
contribution
to
the
attendant
priests
are
requirements
for
admittance
to
the
floor
of
the
church
below
at
the
further
end
stood
the
gaudy
altar
in
its
center
a
alcove
containing
the
virgin
of
copacabana
the
figure
scarcely
three
feet
high
was
cumbered
with
several
rich
silk
gowns
laden
with
gold
and
jewels
and
with
a
blazing
golden
crown
many
sizes
too
large
her
were
expanses
of
heavens
and
half
a
hundred
of
what
looked
to
a
layman
like
large
daggers
threatened
her
from
all
sides
the
original
idol
had
been
destroyed
by
the
spaniards
the
present
incumbent
having
been
fashioned
in
by
lineal
descendant
of
the
incas
he
was
no
artist
but
was
said
to
have
been
inspired
by
the
virgin
herself
the
place
was
unusually
immaculate
for
the
andes
as
becomes
a
famous
shrine
where
money
pours
in
the
year
around
and
was
in
striking
contrast
to
the
squalor
of
the
surrounding
region
the
entire
floor
below
was
crowded
with
kneeling
pilgrims
weirdly
by
candles
except
around
the
altar
where
there
was
light
enough
to
make
priests
acolytes
and
the
virgin
stand
out
brilliantly
a
week
is
the
customary
length
of
stay
for
pilgrims
with
a
ceremony
of
welcome
and
one
of
dismissal
separated
by
a
long
series
of
masses
confessions
and
to
mention
the
ubiquitous
fees
it
is
perfectly
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
andes
as
the
priest
from
the
neighboring
town
having
taken
me
in
hand
as
soon
as
i
appeared
in
the
gallery
whispered
above
the
rumble
of
the
services
that
nuestra
señora
de
copacabana
is
an
champion
in
the
miracle
line
for
instance
hardly
a
year
back
she
had
picked
up
a
ship
about
to
be
wrecked
on
the
coast
of
chile
and
set
it
out
a
thousand
miles
or
so
into
the
pacific
merely
because
one
of
the
sailors
had
had
the
presence
of
mind
to
call
upon
her
at
the
height
of
the
storm
the
newspapers
of
the
time
seem
to
have
covered
the
service
poorly
or
there
was
the
case
of
the
indian
in
my
cicerone
s
own
parish
who
working
in
his
field
far
up
the
side
of
a
mountain
sloping
swiftly
toward
titicaca
suddenly
fell
headlong
down
the
precipice
he
would
infallibly
have
been
dashed
to
pieces
on
the
rocks
below
had
he
not
suddenly
halfway
down
uttered
the
name
of
the
i
never
knew
the
mind
of
an
andean
indian
to
work
with
such
instantly
found
himself
comfortably
seated
back
in
his
own
field
again
the
fact
should
not
be
lost
sight
of
however
in
rating
this
marvel
that
the
aymará
husbandman
cheers
on
his
labors
with
an
even
stronger
chicha
than
that
of
his
quichua
cousins
to
the
north
the
ceremony
we
were
now
witnessing
was
that
of
dismissing
the
departing
pilgrims
at
about
intervals
there
knelt
on
the
steps
of
the
altar
one
person
a
man
and
wife
or
sometimes
a
man
wife
and
child
always
of
the
same
family
an
indian
acolyte
in
red
thrust
a
lighted
candle
into
a
hand
of
each
the
chief
priest
bowed
down
before
the
image
while
back
beside
us
in
the
gallery
an
indian
in
a
poncho
pumped
a
wheezing
melodeon
and
the
choir
consisting
of
several
boys
four
old
women
wrapped
to
the
ends
of
their
noses
in
black
mantos
and
three
merry
little
girls
who
managed
to
keep
up
a
constant
gossip
and
game
through
it
all
knelt
on
the
floor
about
the
instrument
and
moaned
weird
hymns
if
the
pilgrim
was
of
the
gente
decente
class
the
hymn
was
in
spanish
if
an
indian
it
was
in
aymará
during
the
singing
and
the
chanting
of
the
priest
another
acolyte
in
a
still
more
striking
robe
stepped
forth
and
covered
the
kneeling
person
or
persons
at
the
altar
with
what
looked
like
a
richly
embroidered
blanket
this
the
priest
beside
me
asserted
was
the
virgin
s
cloak
capable
of
protecting
from
all
evil
for
a
certain
length
of
perhaps
with
the
fee
then
suddenly
the
cloak
was
snatched
away
the
candles
were
jerked
out
of
the
hands
of
the
worshippers
the
latter
were
all
but
bodily
pushed
aside
and
a
priest
on
the
called
out
the
next
name
from
the
list
in
his
hands
this
was
startlingly
unbolivian
in
efficiency
keeping
things
moving
with
a
rush
and
calling
the
next
group
almost
before
the
acolyte
reached
for
the
blue
blanket
the
attitude
of
all
those
professionally
connected
with
the
ceremony
was
scornful
careless
and
a
new
york
barber
who
is
convinced
there
is
no
tip
coming
the
fifth
group
to
appear
however
was
less
cavalierly
treated
a
tall
man
stepped
forward
and
an
acolyte
quickly
slipped
in
front
of
him
a
or
with
high
back
of
the
style
used
in
church
by
south
american
women
then
to
my
surprise
two
young
men
in
riding
breeches
and
leggings
who
had
been
standing
near
us
in
the
gallery
stumbled
over
each
other
in
their
haste
to
get
down
to
the
floor
below
and
kneel
on
either
side
of
the
older
man
ese
caballero
whispered
the
priest
beside
me
with
a
distinct
tone
of
pride
in
his
voice
is
a
famous
lawyer
and
from
la
paz
and
those
are
his
two
sons

are

on

when
the
cloak
had
been
laid
away
for
the
night
the
chief
priest
mounted
a
pulpit
projecting
from
the
and
in
the
same
drawl
in
which
he
had
chanted
at
the
altar
compared
with
which

soft
and

either
preached

recited
a

imparted
some
stern
orders
from

neither

am
certain
any
other
hearer
not
previously
informed
ever
guessed
for
the
monotonous
drone
in
which
he
hurried
through
the
thing
like
a
man
with
an
appointed
tryst

such
that
during
the
full
twenty
minutes
it
lasted
i
had
not
the
faintest
notion
whether
it
was
in
latin
spanish
or
aymará
the
only
intelligible
word
i
caught
was
an
slovenly
then
the
acolytes
hastily
snuffed
the
candles
and
we
filed
out
at
the
foot
of
the
stairway
my
companion
was
fallen
upon
by
an
old
indian
and
his
son
who
imprinting
a
of
kisses
on
his
by
no
means
hands
begged
him
to
hear
them
confess
he
waved
them
aside
as
one
might
an
importunate
cur
until
the
indian
redoubling
his
osculations
assured
him
he
had
real
coin
to
pay
for
the
service
whereupon
the
good
padre
took
courteous
leave
of
me
and
led
the
pair
to
his
room
in
the
monastery
i
was
hurrying
into
my
clothes
in
the
bitter
cold
titicaca
dawn
when
the
faint
whistle
of
the
yapura
was
borne
to
my
ears
to
my
astonishment
it
was
barely
five
so
great
is
the
difference
in
the
hour
of
sunrise
in
the
few
degrees
i
had
moved
southward
since
leaving
cuzco
copacabana
in
its
lap
of
terraced
hills
shrunk
into
the
past
as
we
slipped
away
around
the
peninsula
of
the
same
name
before
us
rose
the
island
of
the
sun
traditional
cradle
of
the
inca
race
and

with
terraces

up
some
of
its
rugged

owner
of

island
it
produces
potatoes
maize
and

on
the

too
all
the
shores
were
terraced
and
cultivated
from
the
water
s
edge
to
the
tops
of
the
ridges

lay
piled
into
the
sky
and
cut
off
from
the
solid
earth
by
vast
banks
of
white
clouds

long
we
passed
a
bit
further
off

island
of

moon

low
ridge
terraced
from
end
to
end
constituting
a
single

for
its
fertility

words
give
but
a
faint
notion
of
the
beauty
of
titicaca
on
a
brilliant
morning
with
its
striking
combinations
of
soft
colors
dense
of
the
lake
curtained
by
tumbled
banks
of
clouds
the
velvety
islands
and
mainland
with
the
playing
across
them
the
mighty
glacier
bulk
of
sorata
piercing
the
sky
seemed
to
move
forward
also
as
the
steamer
slipped
lazily
on
frequently
bringing
into
view
new
and
more
delicately
beautiful
combinations
of
the
same
elements
the
bolivian
mainland
we
drew
near
in
the
early
afternoon
was
of
a
reddish
soil
with
many
patches
of
bright
green
and
pretty
little
tilted
fields
checkering
the
ridges
clear
down
to
the
water
s
edge
at
guaqui
the
no
train
was
to
leave
for
hours
and
i
set
out
afoot
across
the
exhilarating
plains
of
bolivia
for
tiahuanaco
twelve
miles
away
it
was
a
fertile
land
where
the
remaining
stubble
suggested
wheat
as
the
chief
product
the
sun
dropped
behind
a
dense
bank
of
clouds
hanging
like
a
pall
over
titicaca
behind
and
there
was
no
sunset
when
the
time
for
it
came
but
only
a
gradual
steady
fading
of
light
to
a
faint
gleam
in
which
the
eyes
could
barely
make
out
the
ground
underfoot
the
evening
stillness
was
broken
only
by
the
rare
lowing
of
a
cow
afar
off
a
shower
that
was
half
hail
and
all
cold
beat
stingingly
into
my
face
but
for
the
storm
and
wind
an
absolute
silence
lay
like
a
solid
wall
on
every
hand
with
nowhere
the
suggestion
of
a
light
the
many
clusters
of
indian
huts
that
had
speckled
the
plain
by
day
seeming
to
keep
disconfidently
out
of
reach
of
highway
and
railroad
at
eight
i
stumbled
into
the
station
building
of
tiahuanaco
the
telegraph
operator
was
sufficiently
impressed
by
my
familiarity
with
the
name
of
the
gringo
superintendent
to
induce
the
woman
across
the
track
to
serve
me
stale
bread
and
native
cheese
and
tea

of
the
water
of
titicaca
brought
here

several
of

was
difficult
to
think
of
that
city
as
the
capital

eight
months
of
considering
lima
the
center
of
the
which
the
world
s
news
all
at
once
jumped
up
to
date
but
it
was
like
reading
a
serial
story
of
which
one
has
lost
several
chapters
and
finds
it
impossible
to
pick
up
all
the
threads
again

unprotected

frigid
by

bulking
stone
church
from
a
slight
rise
of
ground
the
flat
plain
sprinkled
with
many
clusters
of
mud
huts
stretches
away
to
a
gouged
and
broken
ridge
here
reddish
there
green
with
vegetation
that
fences
it
in
huge
blocks
of
stone
lie
tumbled
and
scattered
over
a
vaster
extent
than
at
luxor
and
karnak
in
a
disarray
at
once
suggesting
earthquake
for
they
seem
too
immense
to
have
been
overthrown
by
a
merely
human
destroying
vengeance
in
the
region
roughly
known
as
peru
there
were
several
detached
and
separate
civilizations
some
of
which
clearly
antedated
the
incas
and
tiahuanaco
has
little
in
common
with
the
ruins
further
north
there
the
relics
consist
almost
exclusively
of
stone
walls
here
there
are
virtually
none
though
excavations
might
uncover
a
few
remnants
what
is
left
looks
in
contrast
to
the
stem
practicability
of
inca
ruins
like
the
caprice
of
some
childish
sovereign
but
it
is
not
certain
how
justly
we
may
judge
of
the
whole
original
plan
since
not
only
the
neighboring
hamlet
as
well
as
la
paz
has
helped
itself
freely
to
the
materials
for
its
own
chief
buildings
but
the
railroad
has
carried
off
vast
quantities
of
it
for
the
construction
of
bridges
and
culverts
the
still
existing
monuments
are
chiefly
immense
stone
blocks
too
great
to
be
moved
by
puny
modern
man
some
still
upright
some
fallen
of
which
machu
picchu
offers
none
are
numerous
sculptured
figures
are
unknown
among
the
ruins
of
peru
while
here
there
are
several
some
resemble
totem
poles
of
stone
the
most
striking
is
a
sturdy
rock
god
his
features
defaced
by
the
revolver
shots
of
the
enlightened
youths
of
la
paz
on
their
sunday
excursions
which
like
the
twin
figures
of
thebes
sits
abandoned
out
on
the
plain
the
monolithic
gateway
a
single
block
of
dark
gray
stone
on
which
the
intricate
carving
and
still
stand
forth
clear
yet
inscrutable
has
been
set
together
again
since
squier
s
day
as
i
sat
gazing
across
the
disordered
mystery
of
long
ago
an
indian
woman
the
ubiquitous
bundle
and
second
generation
on
her
back
a
crude
sling
in
one
hand
drove
her
pigs
out
into
what
seems
once
to
have
been
the
main
square
of
the
ruined
city
as
the
animals
fell
to
rooting
about
among
the
ruins
the
woman
walked
across
to
the
inscrutable
stone
god
and
bowed
down
before
it
with
a
strange
heathenish
courtesy
i
attempted
to
work
my
way
around
to
leeward
in
the
hope
of
catching
a
photograph
of
the
aboriginal
rite
but
while
i
was
still
some
distance
off
she
either
spied
or
scented
me
and
raced
away
toward
the
town
at
a
greater
speed
than
i
had
ever
before
witnessed
in
one
of
her
race
in
the
modern
town
dwells
an
indolent
not
to
say
insolent
population
of
cholos
and
indians
ignorant
as
the
arabs
of
the
nile
of
the
motive
that
brings
strange
beings
from
far
off
to
view
the
disdained
remnants
of
long
ago
yet
ready
to
take
all
possible
advantage
of
that
absurd
custom
the
place
bids
fair
to
become
as
overrun
with
the
pests
of
tourist
centers
as
the
of
europe
already
the
stranger
is
greeted
by
a
rabble
of
unsoaped
urchins
offering
for
sale
as
antigüedades
all
manner
of
worthless
pebbles
aware
that
visitors
for
some
strange
reason
are
interested
only
in
things
of
great
age
these
children
vociferously
proclaim
everything
in
sight
muy
antigua
even
to
the
loaves
and
meat
displayed
in
the
shops
a
statement
for
which
there
is
some
basis
the
bulking
church
of
the
town
as
well
as
portions
of
the
rudest
edifices
is
constructed
of
splendid
on
either
side
of
the
entrance
are
the
torsos
of
a
man
and
a
woman
crudely
carved
from
reddish
sandstone
sadly
defaced
and
having
an
even
greater
air
of
antiquity
than
the
chief
monuments
out
on
the
plain
they
would
be
more
properly
in
their
setting
out
among
the
other
ruins
here
they
are
startling
as
one
bursts
unexpectedly
upon
them
facing
the
empty
plaza
of
the
dawdling
village
the
train
snorted
in
soon
after
noon
across
the
bleak
collao
spring
plowing
was
at
its
height
amid
much
ceremony
many
of
the
sleek
oxen
were
by
the
red
and
yellow
flags
of
bolivia
set
upright
on
the
yoke
across
their
horns
gay
streamers
and
banners
decorated
animals
and
plow
while
the
indian
family
that
in
each
case
had
come
in
full
force
to
see
the
propitiation
of
the
spirits
that
rule
over
the
fields
was
garbed
in
its
gayest
for
not
only
must
the
moon
be
in
a
particular
phase
but
all
gods
must
be
won
over
all
demons
exorcised
and
all
signs
promising
before
it
is
worth
while
to
begin
the
year
s
sowing
what
a
fertile
plateau
it
was
compared
to
stony
peru
the
plowing
unchecked
over
hill
and
dale
of
the
slightly
rolling
plain
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
an
official
passing
through
the
train
to
examine
the
bundles
for
contraband
was
the
only
formality
that
had
marked
the
passing
of
the
frontier
in
the
car
i
began
to
gather
the
impression
that
the
aymará
indian
if
morose
and
even
less
given
to
smiling
was
on
the
whole
a
more
promising
type
of
humanity
than
the
quichuas
for
though
he
was
more
inclined
to
insolence
he
was
far
less
obsequious
more
manly
than
the
slinking
race
to
the
north
less
passive
and
obedient
more
bellicose
and
jealous
of
his
rights
and
as
long
as
there
is
any
fight
left
in
a
man
there
is
still
hope
for
him
the
day
waned
a
plowman
driving
his
oxen
homeward
and
carrying
the
plow
on
his
own
shoulder
is
a
touch
gray
did
not
catch
the
plain
grew
less
fertile
and
was
dotted
now
with
countless
illimani
and
a
long
grew
up
before
us
we
climbed
somewhat
though
the
world
roundabout
seemed
level
as
before
the
railroad
swung
to
the
left
the
scores
of
mule
donkey
and
llama
however
kept
straight
on
across
the
bleak
plain
till
suddenly
at
a
white
pillar
a
few
miles
away
they
seemed
to
drop
all
at
once
into
the
unknown
over
the
edge
of
the
near
horizon
where
the
train
halted
i
scorned
the
electric
trolley
and
walking
a
few
yards
saw
suddenly
burst
upon
me
a
scene
for
once
superior
to
the
anticipation
paz
america
s
most
lofty
capital
in
its
hole
in
the
ground
up
there
at
the
alto
feet
above
the
sea
all
was
brown
cold
barren
unenticing
all
about
behind
and
around
me
the
bleak
uninhabited
andean
plateau
stony
and
drear
cherishing
nothing
but
bunches
of
tough
stretched
away
like
a
faded
brown
sea
to
the
hazy
distance
then
at
my
very
feet
this
gave
way
and
all
the
nearby
world
pitched
headlong
down
into
a
gashed
and
broken
chasm
feet
down
measuring
perhaps
two
miles
across
from
where
i
stood
to
an
equal
height
on
the
tumbled
and
ramified
foothills
opposite
these
breaking
and
splitting
and
falling
away
into
unseen
valleys
and
climbing
out
again
to
become
more
rugged
and
higher
ridges
finally
culminated
in
a
vast
and
jagged
mass
of
snow
and
ice
cut
off
from
the
solid
earth
by
banks
of
clouds
above
which
the
reflection
of
the
descending
sun
streamed
in
brilliant
rose
color
upon
the
glaciered
pinnacle
of
giant
illimani
feet
above
the
sea
across
the
broad
puna
a
cold
fitful
wind
whistled
lugubriously
down
below
though
barely
a
sound
of
life
except
the
snort
of
a
regimental
band
came
up
this
sheer
from
the
city
all
seemed
pleasantly
cozy
and
warm
the
lower
flanks
of
the
great
were
checkered
with
little
indian
farms
now
mostly
from
being
newly
plowed
some
still
the
of
old
crops
and
all
hanging
at
a
decided
angle
further
down
on
the
floor
of
the
valley
itself
were
similar
irregular
patches
chiefly
of
the
brilliant
green
of
alfalfa
of
every
conceivable
shape
triangular
horseshoe
veritable
gerrymanders
in
the
strange
forms
given
them
by
the
configurations
of
the
ground
for
once
down
below
it
this
proves
by
no
means
so
as
it
seems
from
above
in
the
very
bottom
of
the
valley
rather
on
the
further
side
and
stretching
a
bit
up
the
opposite
slope
lay
la
paz
itself
it
was
a
compact
city
so
compact
that
it
seemed
one
conglomerate
mass
into
which
the
eye
broke
only
once
the
central
plaza
tiny
from
here
as
a
green
paster
on
a
vast
from
this
height
one
saw
little
but
the
roofs
the
of
the
tiles
greatly
too
much
red
as
in
the
garments
of
an
indian
gathering
next
came
the
white
and
colored
then
the
sober
gray
of
old
churches
and
finally
here
and
there
the
edge
of
a
blue
green
or
even
an
orange
wall
peering
above
the
mass
all
about
the
city
proper
imperceptibly
joining
it
and
stretching
away
on
nearly
all
sides
over
vastly
more
space
than
the
town
itself
were
perhaps
half
as
many
buildings
scattered
singly
or
in
small
clusters
forming
an
almost
unbroken
row
down
the
valley
to
the
southeastward
here
and
there
one
of
these
ostentated
itself
in
brilliant
red
most
of
them
were
or
the
gray
of
and
everywhere
between
them
were
the
irregular
green
of
plowed
patches
with
now
and
then
a
grove
of
eucalyptus
or
a
patch
of
willows
enticing
from
this
treeless
height
where
once
the
eye
rose
a
bit
from
the
floor
of
the
valley
there
was
not
the
suggestion
of
a
shrub
not
the
least
striking
feature
of
the
scene
was
the
glassy
clearness
of
the
atmosphere
with
nowhere
a
puff
of
smoke
and
absolutely
nothing
to
dim
the
view
if
the
clock
in
the
tower
of
the
congress
building
had
been
larger
it
would
have
been
easy
to
tell
the
time
by
it
brown
ribbons
of
roads
all
starting
at
a
pillar
on
the
plateau
above
strung
like
drippings
of
syrup
down
all
sides
of
the
cuenca
except
on
the
rugged
uninhabited
flank
opposite
and
along
all
of
them
on
this
saturday
afternoon
crawled
at
what
seemed
a
snail
s
pace
files
of
indians
with
their
laden
donkeys
and
llamas
the
cargoes
generally
covered
with
straw
the
drivers
chiefly
in
red
ponchos
though
so
like
tiny
crawling
ants
were
they
from
this
height
that
the
colors
were
barely
noted
seldom
broken
these
strings
of
stretched
from
the
edge
of
the
plateau
to
where
the
head
of
each
procession
to
the
morrow
s
market
was
swallowed
up
in
the
compact
silent
city
i
walked
on
around
the
yawning
chasm
the
wind
that
howled
across
the
puna
reaching
the
very
marrow
of
my
bones
a
raging
beating
upon
me
for
a
brief
moment
and
making
the
city
below
seem
doubly
snug
and
serene
by
contrast
the
little
great
river
of
la
paz
one
did
not
see
at
all
so
tiny
is
it
and
worn
so
far
down
into
the
clay
soil
of
the
valley
in
a
gorge
descending
through
tumbled
ranges
of
gnarled
hills
toward
the
as
the
bolivian
calls
the
tropical
below
mere
words
give
but
a
faint
notion
of
this
lower
end
of
the
cuenca
of
la
paz
for
so
broken
and
pitched
and
tumbled
so
fantastically
gashed
by
the
rains
is
it
that
it
would
be
an
indescribably
beautiful
thing
even
if
there
were
not
added
the
wonderful
colors
and
a
rich
predominating
over
the
countless
split
and
torn
and
hollows
and
needles
and
pinnacles
of
earth
across
which
the
play
incessantly
the
mournful
notes
of
a
or
rude
indian
flute
floated
sadly
by
on
the
wind
then
sunset
crept
relentlessly
across
the
valley
to
the
town
that
seemed
to
crouch
motionless
with
fear
of
the
darkness
descending
upon
it
paused
a
moment
to
do
its
work
well
swallowing
up
all
before
it
in
the
purple
twilight
of
tropical
altitudes
then
climbed
slowly
again
out
of
the
hollow
on
the
further
side
and
spread
at
last
across
all
the
world
the
city
s
bright
colors
had
faded
to
an
indistinct
sameness
the
brown
hills
and
deeply
eroded
clay
cliffs
were
blotched
red
by
the
departing
sun
though
the
snow
peaks
above
were
still
ablaze
with
light
the
purple
bases
of
the
range
receded
into
black
then
into
nothing
leaving
illimani
standing
forth
white
and
cold
as
a
once
ardent
hope
utterly
alone
in
the
luminous
sky
of
the
andean
night
i
descended
afoot
behind
the
last
a
stony
from
the
pillar
to
the
central
plaza
the
first
information
to
reach
me
was
that
la
paz
outdid
in
cost
of
living
even
lima
which
is
criminal
the
having
but
four
fifths
the
value
of
the
i
had
fancied
prices
would
be
correspondingly
lower
but
here
units
were
often
required
where
one
had
sufficed
before
and
the
great
majority
scorned
to
do
business
in
smaller
coins
the
hotels
which
my
sadly
mutilated
letter
of
credit
permitted
me
to
enter
were
not
only
unsavory
and
atrociously
managed
but
had
the
barbarous
custom
of
several
beds
in
a
room
each
in
turn
attempted
to
thrust
me
into
a
rumpled
nest
with
four
or
five
others
of
unknown
nationality
or
antecedents
close
beside
it
within
a
battered
door
to
which
there
was
neither
lock
nor
bolt
whatever
else
i
may
be
i
am
distinctly
not
a
gregarious
being
in
that
sense
whereupon
they
offered
me
a
room
with
only
companion
as
if
there
were
any
particular
virtue
in
numbers
i
brought
up
at
last
in
the
tambo
quirquincha
facing
the
plaza
alonzo
de
mendoza
an
inn
favored
almost
entirely
by
natives
arriving
on
horseback
the
constitution
of
bolivia
asserts
that
sucre
is
the
real
capital
but
permits
congress
to
choose
its
place
of
meeting
and
because
of
the
constant
danger
from
our
two
chief
enemies
peru
and
chile
at
the
northern
end
of
the
republic
the
government
really
resides
in
la
how
much
the
choice
is
governed
by
the
fact
that
there
is
no
railroad
but
only
a
mule
trail
to
the
real
capital
is
a
matter
of
conjecture
at
any
rate
the
president
has
not
been
in
sucre
in
more
than
a
dozen
years
congress
has
its
seat
in
la
paz
and
the
head
of
the
army
resides
which
will
no
doubt
continue
at
least
until
the
railroad
reaches
sucre
on
the
other
hand
the
former
chuquisaca
is
honored
with
the
presence
of
the
supreme
court
and
the
archbishop
of
bolivia
who
do
not
have
to
move
often
enough
to
make
mule
trails
burdensome
but
sucre
will
not
be
comforted
her
chief
newspaper
is
named
la
capital
each
of
its
editorials
ends
with
the
argument
la
capital
and
it
always
refers
to
la
paz
as
the
present
seat
of
this
seat
of
government
perhaps
the
most
indian
capital
of
all
south
america
has
the
most
purely
spanish
name
it
should
still
be
called
chuquiyapu
as
the
aboriginals
refer
to
it
rather
than
by
the
trite
castilian
designation
that
is
duplicated
a
score
of
times
throughout
the
census
of
discovered
persons
in
the
entire
hole
in
the
ground
of
these
were
rated
white
but
as
usual
in
the
enumerators
got
the
color
sadly
mixed
with
the
social
position
of
the
enumerated
indeed
the
chief
of
the
census
goes
on
to
explain
white
as
descendants
more
or
less
pure
of
spaniards
europeans
or
north
americans
other
words
anyone
with
a
distinct
trace
of
european
blood
there
may
be
a
third
that
many
of
strictly
caucasian
race
of
the
foreign
residents
were
americans
of
were
foreign
men
foreign
women
bolivian
men
chiefly
atheists
and
bolivian
woman
bold
woman
indeed
to
admit
it
the
census
rated
of
the
population
as
indians
but
here
again
the
social
status
must
have
played
its
part
or
else
there
are
many
country
indians
often
in
the
city
african
blood
is
extremely
rare
though
slavery
was
not
abolished
until
it
is
no
climate
for
negroes
the
unmarried
american
women
are
nearly
all
teachers
the
report
continues
then
takes
a
rap
at
the
country
s
chief
enemy
for
stealing
her
seaport
and
bottling
her
up
within
south
america
by
remarking
las
chilenas
living
in
la
paz
are
almost
without
exception
most
striking
of
all
the
data
perhaps
is
the
fact
that
of
the
inhabitants
over
nineteen
years
of
age
only
are
married
but
this
does
not
mean
that
race
suicide
is
imminent
rather
that
the
priests
have
made
the
cost
of
marriage
all
but
prohibitive
to
the
lower
classes
and
that
many
others
are
thereby
influenced
to
consider
the
ceremony
of
minor
importance
in
the
entire
republic
are
alfabéticos
that
is
know
their
letters
a
much
more
handy
expression
in
statistics
than
read
and
only
honduras
in
all
america
is
so
low
in
this
respect

before
which
the

bowed
down
in
worship
roughly
speaking
the
population
is
divided
into
three
classes
as
everywhere
in
the
andes
each
shading
into
the
other
until
the
lines
of
demarkation
are
at
best
hazy
of
the
whites
the
census
report
itself
asserts
sequestered
they
knew
more
of
theological
subtleties
than
of
religion
were
more
devout
than
moral
and
had
more
preoccupations
than
ideas
there
is
even
no
stimulus
for
their
best
faculties
and
they
have
lost
almost
completely
that
virile
character
bequeathed
them
by
their
spanish
ancestors
they
will
work
only
at
commerce
or
government
employments
that
demand
no
corporeal
effeminate
is
the
description
that
most
quickly
occurs
to
the
foreigner
but
they
are
no
more
so
than
all
men
of
the
gente
decente
class
throughout
south
america
even
the
whites
take
on
something
of
that
sulky
that
unobliging
insolence
of
the
aymará
character
and
one
quickly
catches
the
feeling
that
the
foreigner
is
disliked
in
bolivia
at
least
far
more
so
than
in
peru
another
native
with
the
point
of
view
of
wide
travel
assures
us
the
whites
are
really
indians
and
cholos
in
their
mode
of
thought
thanks
to
the
aymará
blood
in
his
veins
or
to
the
effect
of
that
environment
on
his
character
the
paceño
lacks
docility
is
uncommunicative
and
is
bored
at
all
times
at
everything
hence
his
desire
for
excitement
for
noise
and
the
resultant
life
in
the
canteens
in
the
three
cold
cities
of
bolivia
more
liquor
is
consumed
than
in
all
the
rest
of
the
country
alcoholism
is
the
national
vice
par
excellence
and
the
surest
way
to
win
a
fortune
is
to
run
a
but
in
any
strict
census
the
cholo
is
the
most
numerous
class
of
la
paz
a
native
writer
succinctly
explains
the
rise
of
this
mixed
race
as
in
the
beginning
the
spaniards
had
not
within
reach
many
women
of
their
own
race
they
satisfied
the
physical
and
moral
necessities
of
the
sex
with
women
of
the
vanquished
tribes
a
few
of
these
succeeded
in
inspiring
real
passion
in
the
breasts
of
the
hardy
conquistadores
sometimes
even
to
the
extent
of
causing
the
latter
to
marry
themselves
legally
and
catholicly
with
our
indian
all
hail
to
the
inspiring
indian
women
one
must
not
however
overlook
the
fact
that
real
passion
among
the
old
spanish
conquistadores
was
not
so
closely
allied
to
soap
and
as
in
our
own
days
short
and
the
women
who
do
not
wear
themselves
out
with
quick
little
eyes
the
cholos
have
much
of
the
independence
of
the
aymará
character
they
are
quite
the
opposite
of
servile
and
somewhat
despise
both
the
whites
and
the
aboriginals
no
country
of
south
america
has
so
large
a
percentage
of
pure
indian
population
as
bolivia
the
aymará
is
by
nature
silent
and
aloof
more
sullen
and
cruel
than
the
quichua
and
by
no
means
so
obsequious
as
the
aboriginals
of
cuzco
he
never
touches
his
hat
to
a
passing
gringo
unlike
the
indian
of
quito
he
crosses
the
main
plaza
in
any
dress
he
chooses
even
carrying
bundles
and
sitting
on
the
benches
in
the
region
roundabout
the
race
has
inner
organizations
under
their
own
chiefs
which
are
virtually
independent
of
the
government
yet
in
town
he
does
as
he
is
ordered
though
sullenly
and
shopkeepers
drag
him
in
to
perform
any
low
task
at
whatever
reward
they
choose
to
give
him
as
or
he
is
farmed
out
as
a
child
and
becomes
virtually
a
slave
that
condition
worries
him
little

in

papers
of

reserves
as
a
day
to

are
reputed
to
take
turns
at
this
recreation
so
that
one
may
be
in
condition
to
lead
the
other
home
when
it
is
over
his
music
is
melancholy
beyond
words
as
a
bolivian
puts
it
he
lives
without
inquietude
and
without
remorse
being
dangerous
only
when
he
is
full
of
liquor
or
religion
he
is
a
beast
of
burden
uncomplaining
desires
nothing
is
apparently
content
with
his
fate
and
looks
with
supreme
indifference
on
all
the
rest
of
the
world
and
its
the
contrasts
of
life
in

are
striking

even
then
it
was
somewhat
wretched
after

and
no
one
would
choose
to
sit
in
pajamas
in
the
central
plaza
at
night
from
eleven
to
three
it
grew
almost
uncomfortably
warm
for
climbing
about

and
the
brilliant
unclouded
sky
was
hard
both
on
eyes
and
nerves
at

it

difficult
for
the

to
get
accustomed
to
seeing
droves
of
llamas
with
drivers
dressed
in
the
style
of

circular

they
smoked
frequently

were
largely
white
though
the
cholo
class
was
by
no
means
unrepresented
and
among
them
were
two
priests
in
full
vestments
their
tonsures
shining
up
at
us
like
rays
from
the
middle
ages
there
were
also
several
who
strangely
resembled

nowhere
was
there
any
outward
sign
of
genius

otherwise

is
a
distinct
gradation
in
the
costumes

especially
among
the
women
the
men
of
the

class
the
whites
and
the

the
best
of
their
ability
as
in
all
andean
capitals
the
cholo
ranging
from
to
both
the
american
and
english
more
or
less
countrified
and
european
garb
even
to
gloves
and
a
cane
on
sunday
if
he
can
get
them
for
social
standing
depends
chiefly
on
dress
the
less
ambitious
wears
the
same
leather

as
the
indian
a
coat
showing
a
bit
above
or
below
his
more
or
less
poncho
a
coarse
shirt
without
collar
and
a
heavy
felt
hat
a
peculiarity
of
the
paceño
costume
as
universal
among
the
indians
and
poorer
cholos
as
the
cord
around
the
knee
of
british
workmen
is
a
slit
in
the

white
undergarment
above
the
bare
brown
ankle
the
indians
conservative
as
all
their
race
are
slow
to
adopt
the
slightest
change
and
still
dress
much
as
in
the
time
of
the
incas
the
men
wear
peaked
of
gay
colors
with
earlaps
like
clowns
in
a
circus
often
with
a
felt
hat
of
varying
tones
of
gray
on

of
it
their
ponchos
of

of
solid
colors
scarlet
purple
some
tone
of
red
always
the
ruling
favorite
much
of
this
cloth
has
for
years
come
from
germany
though
there
is
still
considerable

weaving
some
go
barefoot
more
often
they
wear
the
heavy
leather

are
displayed
in
large
quantities
in

the
men
of
la
paz
lend
it
little
color
compared
to
the
women
these
may
be
roughly
divided
following
the
local
phraseology
into
señoritas
cholas
and
indias
though
these
in
turn
subdivide
until
there
are
six
rather
distinct
costume
classes
all
shading
somewhat
into
one
another
first
the
foreign
women
and
a
small
number
of
native
white
ones
copy
the
styles
of
paris
with
more
or
less
success
second
the
moderately
all
those
of
the
gente
decente
class
during
the
morning
hours
of
mass
it
being
against
the
rules
to
wear
a
hat
in
themselves
from
head
to
foot
in
the
jet
black
that
gives
them
the
appearance
of
stalking
crows
these
commonly
powder
their
faces
with
what
seems
to
be
cheap
flour
and
are
rarely
startling
in
their
beauty
though
many
are
physically
attractive
between
the
ages
of
seventeen
and
illustration
arequipa
second

in

backed

suddenly
the
bleak
pampa
falls
away
at
one
s
feet
and
la

in
its
hole
in
the
ground
feet
below
spreads
out
at
the
foot
of
illimani
and
its
sister
peaks
third
to
be
marked
with
two
stars
comes
the
most
picturesque
figure
in
bolivia
if
not
in
south
america
chola
de
la
paz
her
mate
may
blossom
out
in
all
the
atrocities
or
european
attire
but
la
chola
clings
tenaciously
and
wisely
to
the
costume
of
her
ancestors
moreover
in
this
case
the
picturesque
is
not
attended
by
its
usual
handmaid
uncleanliness
la
paz
is
not
immaculate
by
modern
standards
but
at
least
la
chola
does
her
share
toward
making
it
seem
so
she
wears
the
usual
multiplicity
of
skirts
but
of
a
finer
material
and
better
fit
than
elsewhere
so
that
while
she
is
still
somewhat
bulky
about
the
hips
she
is
not
disagreeably
so
her
outer
skirt
is
always
of
a
solid
color
distinctly
gay
but
never
of
the
crudeness
this
garment
attains
among
the
indian
women
of
cloth
it
stops
just
halfway
from
foot
to
knee
never
high
enough
to
suggest
immodesty
and
never
low
enough
to
drag
on
the
ground
as
is
the
distressing
custom
among
many
of
the
women
up
and
down
the
andes
above
this
she
wears
two
least
that
is
the
nearest
english
equivalent
in
a
male
some
excellent
material
closely
resembling
silk
with
perpendicular
stripes
of
varying
width
and
color
the
whole
gay
in
the
extreme
yet
never
clashing
with
the
rest
of
the
costume
so
far
as
the
mere
male
eye
can
detect
these
being
large
they
are
folded
in
the
middle
and
thrown
about
the
shoulders
a
glimpse
of
the
inner
one
adding
to
the
gaiety
of
the
ensemble
the
fringe
of
both
sweeping
her
ankles
her
hair
jet
black
and
coarse
as
a
horse
s
mane
she
parts
in
the
middle
and
combs
flat
on
either
side
the
ends
of
the
braids
without
the
suggestion
of
a
decoration
of
ribbon
or
flower
hanging
sometimes
inside
sometimes
outside
the
shawls
from
her
ears
swing
heavy
earrings
of
fantastic
design
some
two
inches
long
most
striking
of
all
is
her
unique
hat
this
is
of
straw
of
panama
texture
with
the
general
form
of
our
derby
or
the
englishman
s
bowler
lacquered
or
glazed
over
with
something
that
causes
it
to
reflect
the
brilliant
sunlight
of
these
heights
like
a
mirror
and
seeming
at
first
sight
as
absurd
and
out
of
place
as
our
own
ard
at
might
to
a
visitor
from
mars
but
one
soon
gets
used
to
it
and
even
to
like
it
especially
as
la
chola
wears
it
at
just
the
suggestion
of
a
rakish
angle
ever
so
slightly
inclined
over
the
right
eye
though
the
that
she
is
wholly
unconscious
of
that
fact
only
adds
to
the
attractiveness
when
she
grows
excited
as
in
arguing
the
price
of
a
nickel
of
beans
in
the
she
has
a
way
of
giving
the
front
rim
a
flip
of
the
finger
that
knocks
the
hat
back
from
her
brow
under
which
circumstances
she
so
vividly
recalls
a
western
drummer
in
a
heated
but
friendly
argument
in
a
that
one
sighs
with
regret
that
she
has
not
a
cigar
protruding
at
an
aggressive
angle
from
the
corner
of
her
mouth
to
complete
the
picture
there
remains
but
to
speak
of
her
footwear
this
consists
of
a
high
shoe
on
a
very
parisian
last
with
high
slender
french
heels
of
every
color
a
shoe
could
be
by
any
stretch
of
propriety
but
with
cream
or
the
favorite
a
bow
of
the
same
seems
to
be
near
the
toe
and
a
bundle
of
tassels
at
the
top
occasionally
the
shoes
are
high
enough
to
join
company
with
the
skirt
below
which
peers
the
white
lace
of
an
inner
petticoat
but
even
then
when
she
stoops
over
in
arguing
a
purchase
one
notes
a
clocked
stocking
that
adds
still
more
to
the
debauch
of
colors
going
on
least
to
where
it
is
fitting
for
a
stranger
to
cease
investigation
astonishment
grows
that
la
chola
can
afford
such
garments
the
shoes
alone
cost
as
high
as
and
every
stitch
in
sight
is
of
a
grade
and
workmanship
that
come
high
in
bolivia
that
would
not
indeed
be
cheap
in
a
far
more
productive
country
yet
the
chief
wonder
is
the
specklessness
of
her
entire
wonderful
to
one
of
long
andean
experience
the
glazed
hat
shines
like
the
polished
dome
of
a
mosque
the
skirts
and
shawls
always
look
as
if
they
had
just
that
moment
come
out
of
a
parisian
shop
and
the
shoes
have
not
a
upon
them
yet
la
chola
wears
this
costume
at
any
hour
and
under
all
the
street
at
carries
on
her
often
soiling
business
in
all
parts
of
town
some
assert
that
she
starves
herself
to
dress
but
her
appearance
does
not
uphold
the
contention
however
she
affords
it
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
the
means
will
continue
and
that
she
will
not
some
day
abandon
in
favor
of
the
atrocities
of
foreign
fashions
the
most
picturesque
costume
in
south
america
and
the
chief
decoration
of
every
outdoor
scene
and
public
gathering
in
la
paz
the
chola
is
not
exactly
the
bequeathed
her
by
indian
forebears
makes
that
word
fail
but
she
is
as
nearly
so
as
the
andean
indian
type
can
become
and
as
she
trips
along
at
a
snappy
energetic
stride
up
and
down
the
cobbled
streets
of
la
paz
in
her
french
heels
and
not
only
does
break
her
neck
but
does
not
even
jar
from
its
angle
her
stiff
at
the
eye
is
as
certain
to
note
her
passing
as
it
would
that
of
a
meteor
in
the
sky
above
she
is
always
and
plump
often
good
to
look
at
in
spite
of
her
rather
bulky
indian
features
and
aggressively
independent
going
anywhere
at
any
time
she
chooses
in
complete
indifference
to
the
oriental
seclusion
that
still
clings
about
the
upper
class
women
she
treats
the
rest
of
the
world
with
a
manner
midway
between
sauciness
and
impudence
scorning
anything
on
the
plane
of
reading
and
writing
with
the
disdain
of
her
indian
forebears
she
holds
most
of
the
places
in
the
market
and
the
or
little
liquor
and
food
shops
and
ranges
all
the
way
from
small
shopkeeper
to
unservile
to
women
one
gets
the
impression
from
a
brief
acquaintance
that
she
is
as
superior
to
her
mate
the
cholo
as
are
the
women
of
tehuantepec
to
their
men
she
speaks
aymará
by
choice
but
will
use
spanish
when
necessary
and
she
is
always
at
least
comparatively
young
one
sees
cholas
up
to
thirty
or
but
as
they
do
not
look
as
if
they
died
off
at
that
age
the
natural
conclusion
is
that
they
fall
into
a
more
somber
and
less
agreeable
costume
la
chola
is
seldom
married
legally
and
catholicly
but
if
she
has
a
baby
a
mishap
that
not
infrequently
befalls
her
she
wears
it
as
all
andean
women
wear
their
babies
her
back
instead
of
being
carelessly
slung
in
a
blanket
tied
across
mother
s
chest
however
this
fortunate
mite
sits
in
a
whole
nest
of
clean
gay
garments
the
spotless
white
lining
hanging
down
a
foot
or
more
on
all
sides
of
it
ending
in
a
lace
fringe
indeed
this
better
care
of
baby
is
notable
in
la
paz
and
has
its
influence
even
among
the
indian
women
but
i
set
out
to
give
a
female
classes
the
fourth
is
the
same
chola
just
a
shade
lower
in
the
scale
she
also
wears
a
little
round
hat
but
of
brown
or
black
felt
her
skirts
and
shawls
are
less
gay
and
of
coarser
texture
her
stockings
are
dark
and
her
footwear
a
low
slipper
without
heel
the
fifth
is
usually
a
common
servant
almost
touching
on
the
indian
woman
her
garments
sometimes
descending
to
the
plebeian
in
which
the
higher
grade
chola
would
scorn
to
be
seen
though
it
is
almost
universal
to
her
class
elsewhere
in
the
andes
she
wears
also
a
shiny
black
slipper
but
no
stockings
though
her
brown
plump
leg
looks
almost
like
finely
woven
silk
there
is
no
suggestion
of
immodesty
in
this
absence
of
nether
covering
yet
when
one
of
this
class
for
some
reason
suddenly
appears
in
the
bare
white
legs
of
what
at
first
glance
seems
a
lady
of
our
own
race
the
sight
brings
something
of
a
shock
of
the
three
types
of
chola
the
third
and
fourth
may
blend
a
bit
sometimes
to
the
extent
of
coiffing
the
latter
in
a
glazed
hat
but
only
the
first
ever
falls
into
the
foolishness
of
the
upper
class
in
flouring
her
face
a
bit
and
at
worst
it
is
confined
to
a
few
sporadic
cases
at
the
bottom
of
the
scale
as
everywhere
in
the
andes
comes
the
indian
woman
varying
a
bit
in
garb
according
to
the
degree
of
her
poverty
she
wears
the
round
felt
hat
and
endures
the
chill
highland
winds
by
wrapping
several
thick
bayeta
skirts
of
clashing
colors
around
her
waist
in
bunches
until
she
looks
am
at
a
loss
for
a
comparison
that
is
ugly
awkward
and
bulky
enough
i
say
like
a
very
badly
packed
sack
of
assorted
hardware
with
the
looser
and
lighter
things
above
the
compressed
middle
she
likes
red
best
and
as
the
day
warms
every
second
or
third
of
the
skirts
she
removes
one
by
one
is
of
some
shade
of
that
color
below
them
are
bronzed
legs
and
either
bare
feet
with
soles
or
as
la
paz
and
vicinity
are
distinctly
stony
as
well
as
cold
with
a
flat
sandal
of
a
single
piece
of
leather
with
thongs
over
the
heel
and
between
the
large
toe
and
the
others
solidly
built
as
she
is
one
wonders
how
the
indian
woman
s
waist
can
support
the
weight
of
six
or
eight
heavy
bayeta
skirts
yet
always
in
addition
to
these
night
or
day
young
or
old
drunk
or
sober
filthy
or
only
dirty
she
carries
a
bundle
on
her
back
in
the
colored
blanket
tied
across
her
chest
with
whenever
her
possibilities
in
this
line
are
head
of
a
baby
protruding
somewhere
from
the
load
now
gazing
earnestly
at
the
road
ahead
now
dancing
a
crowing
hornpipe
on
the
broad
back
of
the
utterly
unresponsive
mother
now
mix
all
these
types
put
at
least
half
the
male
population
in
gay
ponchos
with
every
known
shade
of
saffron
red
orange
purple
and
the
like
sprinkle
among
them
youths
with
long
hair
tied
in
queues
wearing
ponchos
that
conceal
all
but
their
sturdy
brown
legs
who
straggle
up
out
of
the
tropical
to
the
east
to
mingle
with
the
city
life
add
a
distinctive
costume
for
each
surrounding
village
the
noiseless
in
his
absurd
cap
a
number
of
germans
in
bolivian
army
uniforms
monks
in
black
brown
and
white
nuns
in
gray
soldiers
in
uniforms
policemen
in
brown
ones
hundreds
of
personal
idiosyncracies
in
color
and
style
and
it
will
be
more
easily
understood
why
la
paz
is
justly
entitled
to
that
overworked
word
picturesque
and
why
the
aboriginal
name
of
chuquiyapu
would
still
be
more
fitting
than
the
trite
spanish
one
by
which
bolivia
s
unofficial
capital
is
known
to
the
world
moreover
children
dress
exactly
like
father
or
mother
as
soon
as
they
can
walk
la
chola
s
little
girl
is
her
mother
s
exact
miniature
glazed
hat
gay
shawl
fancy
little
shoes
and
all
as
likely
as
not
with
a
doll
in
fancy
garments
on
her
back
the
cholo
s
son
paddles
behind
his
father
in
long
breeches
slit
up
the
back
gay
poncho
and
felt
hat
the
little
indian
girl
trots
after
her
mother
in
the
selfsame
red
green
or
magenta
skirts
of
bayeta
the
round
felt
hat
on
her
head
and
always
a
bundle
on
her
back
though
she
be
barely
three
years
old
and
the
burden
only
a
bundle
of
if
to
accustom
her
early
to
the
life
she
must
lead
to
the
day
of
her
funeral
illustration
llamas
of
la
paz
patiently
awaiting
the
return
of
their
driver
illustration
down
the
valley
below
la
paz
the
pink
and
yellow
soil
stands
in
fantastic
cliffs
there
are
many
fine
walks
in
and
about
la
paz
on
a
sunny
afternoon
as
an
afternoon
can
be
only
at
this
height
it
is
a
joy
to
follow
a
muddy
little
creek
known
as
the
chuquiyapu
down
through
the
broken
and
tumbled
gorge
below
the
town
where
the
clay
soil
now
sandy
white
now
soft
red
is
into
a
hundred
fantastic
shapes
the
slender
eucalyptus
and
a
species
of
line
the
way
illimani
raises
its
hoar
head
higher
and
higher
into
the
sky
above
seeming
to
calm
the
spirits
with
its
majestic
serenity
and
promise
of
perpetual
coolness
so
imperceptibly
does
the
valley
descend
that
one
could
drift
clear
down
into
the
languid
tropical
that
draws
one
on
like
a
lodestone
like
the
spicy
garlic
smells
of
the
far
east
until
suddenly
realizing
how
far
the
city
has
been
left
behind
one
takes
oneself
figuratively
by
the
neck
and
turns
back
to
the
town
or
there
is
the
climb
out
of
the
cuenca
itself
a
stiff
hour
to
the
pillar
above
once
on
the
bleak
puna
i
wandered
along
the
edge
of
the
chasm
to
get
a
view
of
the
city
below
from
all
angles
near
the
station
my
eye
was
caught
by
the
private
car
of
a
railroad
superintendent
fancying
it
might
be
that
of
my
host
on
the
journey
up
from
arequipa
i
strolled
toward
it
a
dishevelled
fellow
his
ragged
coat
close
up
around
his
neck
his
long
hair
protruding
like
straw
from
a
scarecrow
a
two
weeks
black
beard
bristling
sat
on
the
back
platform
peeling
potatoes
está
aqui
el
señor
i
asked
casually
a
cloud
of
incomprehension
seemed
to
pass
over
the
scarecrow
face
i
repeated
the
question
thinking
he
might
be
one
of
those
natives
so
often
found
at
large
in
south
america
english
english
is
all
i
talks
came
the
startling
reply
out
of
the
depths
of
the
unshaven
one
not
only
the
accent
but
the
presence
of
a
few
blackened
stumps
in
lieu
of
teeth
betraying
both
the
nationality
and
the
caste
of
the
speaker
as
i
had
never
since
leaving
panama
seen
a
white
man
much
less
an
person
doing
manual
labor
my
mistake
was
natural
thanks
to
the
pleasure
of
having
a
hearer
who
could
understand
him
the
exile

sad
not
to
say
jumbled

to
sweep
across
the
plateau
was
not
the
only
reason
i
decided
to
be
on
my
way
as
the
sun
sets
gradually
down
through
the
cuenca
of
la
paz
so
it
rises
gilding
first
the
western
precipice
far
up
near
the
edge
of
the
plateau
plainly
seen
from
my
pillow
in
the
tambo
quirquincha
then
slowly
crawling
down
into
the
valley
until
long
after
its
first
appearance
it
finally
floods
in
upon
the
city
itself
and
lights
up
its
streets
and
eastern
on
such
a
cool
morning
known
to
the
calendar
as
december
fourth
a
cholo
boy
of
eleven
presented
himself
to
carry
my
baggage
to
the
station
and
did
so
easily
though
i
should
have
groaned
at
the
load
myself
the
coaches
here
tramcars
left
first
and
slowly
corkscrewed
up
out
of
the
valley
the
motorman
once
we
were
started
coming
inside
where
it
was
a
bit
less
frigid
closing
the
door
behind
him
and
giving
all
his
attention
to
two
comely
cholas
whose
little
black
eyes
jumped
about
like
those
of
on
the
alto
a
brilliant
sun
somewhat
tempered
the
biting
cold
of
the
puna
at
this
early
hour
at
viacha
a
better
train
awaited
us
her
engine
turned
south
vestibuled
cars
marked
ferrocarril
á
bolivia
and
plying
to
antofagasta
a
smooth
roadbed
that
spoke
of
chile
and
more
modern
countries
a
diner
ready
for
those
who
did
not
choose
to
buy
boiled
goat
and
frozen
potatoes
of
the
indian
women
squatting
at
the
stations
once
off
across
the
sandy
wilderness
flat
as
a
sea
with
herds
of
llamas
grazing
here
and
there
and
little
farms
of
all
shapes
hanging
on
the
slopes
of
and
gradually
receding
hillsides
the
train
sped
on
as
if
it
never
intended
to
stop
again
in
truth
there
was
little
reason
to
do
so
for
it
was
as
dreary
a
region
as
the
imagination
could
picture
the
few
stations
at
which
we
halted
briefly
single
huts
on
the
edge
of
salt
marshes
bore
names
fitting
to
the
landscape
soledad
a
lone
tree
afforded
the
only
feature
to
which
a
name
could
be
attached
now
and
then
mirages
across
the
dismal
desert
gave
the
the
appearance
of
islands
the

seeming
to
be

in
their
striking
costume
in

arose
across
the
brown
pampa
as
port
saïd
rises
from
her
muddy
sea
and
we
rumbled
into
a
flat
miserable
if
from
the
miner
s
point
of
view
important
town
gloomy
bleak
perhaps
the
most
desolate
city
my
eyes
had
ever
fallen
upon
the
squat
adobe
buildings
chiefly
were
in
many
cases
thatched
over
tile
roofs
giving
them
the
appearance
of
wearing
a
hat
over
colored
caps
like
the
indians
of
la
paz
utterly
barren
desert
hills
with
mine
openings
formed
the
background
the
wind
drove
the
sand
like
needles
into
our
faces
and
seemed
bent
on
cutting
our
eyes
out
cholas
ostentated
themselves
in
somewhat
the
same
costume
as
those
of
the
seat
of
government
but
dulled
and
soiled
by
the
dust
siberian
dreary
comfortless
the
place
seemed
yet
its
stores
were
and
there
were
more
gringos
per
capita
than
i
had
seen
in
many
a
day
seeming
to
hate
themselves
and
life
in
general
even
the
americans
had
a
haughty
unapproachable
air
as
in
so
many
mining
towns
of
the
andes
the
unconscious
result
no
doubt
of
caste
treatment
of
indian
workmen
i
was
only
too
glad
when
the
train
on
a
carried
us
off
northeastward
late
next
morning
a
long
string
of
mud
monuments
still
marks
the
centuries
route
across
the
trackless
desert
huts
of
mud
huddled
in
the
sunshine
here
and
there
we
climbed
in
long
zigzags
over
the
crest
of
the
cuesta
colorada
drear
hills
of
broken
rock
where
only
a
scant
brown
finds
foothold
below
the
divide
hearty
gringo
faces
more
cheerful
in
this
lower
altitude
broke
in
now
and
then
on
the
monotony
of
features
many
tents
marked
with
large
letters
f
lined
the
way
interspersed
with
the
stone
kennels
of
workmen
and
their
women
and
the
swarming
natural
consequences
there
is
something
about
a
railroad
more
suggestive
of
the
world
s
progress
than
almost
any
other
labor
of
man
the
new
line
petered
out
in
the
stony
village
of
changolla
some
miles
from
oruro
and
halfway
to
cochabamba
which
it
is
in
time
due
to
reach
a
offered
accommodations
for
the
rest
of
the
trip
but
the
joy
of
jolting
all
day
in
the
thing
was
not
commensurate
with
the
pleasure
of
a
new
experience
even
had
the
fare
for
both
passengers
and
baggage
not
been
prohibitive
to
a
scantily
supplied
wanderer
see
sinclair
there
suggested
the
gringo
chief
pointing
to
a
sandy
unshaven
scot
of
more
than
six
energetic
feet
who
was
superintending
the
loading
of
all
manner
of
railroad
material
into
ponderous
carts
and
the
hint
was
sufficient
changolla
would
have
been
excited
that
night
were
it
possible
for
railroad
constructors
of
long
experience
in
many
wild
regions
to
become
so
a
and
predecessor
of
the
new
zealander
in
charge
of
the
camp
had
gone
on
a
rampage
with
an
american
youth
and
turned
bandits
in
style
filled
with
distilled
bravery
they
had
held
up
a
nearby
camp
under
the
impression
that
the
paymaster
had
arrived
and
disappointed
in
this
they
had
shot
a
harmless
chilian
employee
it
took
some
time
and
all
my
papers
to
calm
the
suspicions
of
changolla
before
i
was
offered
lodging
with
the
new
zealander
the
bandits
had
sworn
to
shoot
him
and
his
assistants
on
sight
and
a
cardboard
had
been
fastened
over
the
window
to
prevent
them
from
carrying
out
the
threat
by
as
we
ate
though
none
of
the
group
showed
any
nervousness
at
the
prospect
but
the
highwaying
of
the
pair
was
amateurish
at
best
they
had
made
no
plans
whatever
for
getting
out
of
town
had
even
to
ask
the
way
and
had
as
bottles
of
whiskey
thus
it
was
not
strange
that
they
were
rounded
up
before
morning
and
my
hosts
showed
no
surprise
when
dawn
disclosed
the
prisoners
shackled
in
one
of
the
they
had
been
taken
asleep
some
ten
miles
from
the
scene
of
the
crime
with
a
bottle
in
one
hand
and
a
gun
in
the
other
the
chief
looked
his
over
expressed
his
sentiments
with
a
you
re
a
hell
of
a
bandit
you
are
lit
a
cigarette
and
went
on
about
his
day
s
work
mounted
on
asses
with
a
stick
through
their
elbows
behind
them
the
pair
set
out
for
cochabamba
guarded
by
a
score
of
soldiers
the
punishment
for
murder
in
bolivia
is
to
be
taken
back
to
the
scene
of
the
crime
and
shot
though
there
is
many
a
slip
between
the
law
and
its
execution
and
judges
according
to
my
hosts
must
be
properly
greased
before
they
will
even
indict
a
criminal
particularly
when
the
complainant
is
a
rich
foreign
company
meanwhile
nine
enormous
carts
each
drawn
by
six
sleek
and
mighty
mules
laden
with
all
the
bulky
material
required
for
railroad
construction
to
say
nothing
of
my
baggage
and
covered
in
fashion
got
under
way
i
set
off
ahead
the
trail
followed
a
broad
stony
and
sandy
across
which
serpentined
a
yellow
brook
of
brackish
water
which
it
was
impossible
by
just
two
steps
to
cross
the
unfinished
railroad
flanked
the
barren
stony
hills
on
the
left
the
embankment
carved
out
of
them
being
broken
by
unbuilt
bridges
and
incomplete
cuts
and
tunnels
that
cost
me
many
a
steep
scramble
in
the
below
passed
a
broken
stream
of
indians
and
cholos
driving
donkeys
and
mules
as
were
most
of
the
drivers
themselves
their
ponchos
chiefly
of
red
with
narrow
perpendicular
stripes
standing
out
against
the
barren
brown
landscape
every
little
green
patch
on
its
edge
was
many
a
hacienda
or
small
village
having
become
a
railway
construction
camp
where
haughty
young
englishmen
gazed
coldly
and
suspiciously
at
one
of
their
race
sinking
his
caste
to
travel
on
foot
the
briton
who
has
knocked
about
the
world
until
the
corners
have
been
blunted
is
an
agreeable
fellow
but
in
his
youthful
days
he
is
best
avoided
the
embankment
gave
out
and
we
struck
a
gorge
where
the
carts
were
saved
only
by
the
vigilance
of
sandy
astride
his
splendid
macho
and
the
mules
as
by
a
miracle
in
the
blazing
dusty
sweat
poured
profusely
as
i
plodded
clinging
to
the
tail
of
a
cart
to
be
snatched
across
the
stream
the
towns
were
miserable
yet
misery
seems
far
less
pitiful
in
perpetual
summer
worst
of
all
there
was
no
water
a
man
dared
drink
the
banks
of
the
river
were
lined
for
broken
spaces
with
large
quantities
of
cobbles
inside
wire
argentine
idea
according
to
the
keep
the
river
from
undermining
and
washing
away
the
coming
railroad
it
seemed
absurd
to
have
to
take
such
precautions
against
a
tiny
meandering
brook
but
in
the
rainy
season
this
increases
to
a
rushing
torrent
filling
all
the
valley
it
was
starving
before
sandy
called
a
halt
for
breakfast
and
the
peons
prepared
a
stew
of
potatoes
charqui
rice
and
anything
else
that
it
occurred
to
them
to
toss
into
the
pot
at
sunset
we
camped
like
gypsies
in
the
stony
waterless
the
mules
were
turned
loose
among
several
heaps
of
straw
carried
in
one
of
the
carts
and
we
rolled
up
in
blankets
on
the
sand
the
drivers
were
a
motley
gang
of
bolivian
argentine
and
chilian
cholos
each
with
the
accent
peculiar
to
his
nationality
all
had
long
knives
in
their
belts
and
were
inclined
to
use
them
on
slight
provocation
several
carried
their
wives
or
at
least
their
women
with
them
in
the
carts
sometimes
with
a
child
or
two
in
addition
next
day
as
i
plodded
beside
his
mule
sandy
whiled
away
the
long
hot
hours
with
reminiscences
did
they
tell
you
in
juliaca
how
i
cleaned
out
their
damned
hotel
he
asked
they
had
but
i
wanted
sandy
s
own
version
of
the
affair
well
we
were
playing
billiards
when
some
greaser
said
something
about
gringos
and
i
told
him
to
shut
up
the
crowd
was
too
drunk
to
know
better
so
i
had
to
take
a
bunch
of
and
clean
out
the
of
them
it
cost
me
just
a
hundred
and
twelve
for
the
greasers
and
a
hundred
to
get
my
friend
the
subprefect
to
lie
low
until
i
could
get
over
the
line
before
the
railway
came
i
used
to
transport
across
the
desert
from
arica
he
went
on
steering
his
mule
around
a
hollow
of
broken
rock
and
i
had
a
little
dog
named
bobbie
burns
he
was
a
wise
little
dog
and
as
the
desert
sand
burned
his
feet
he
got
still
wiser
and
used
to
run
way
ahead
of
me
a
mile
or
so
so
far
he
could
just
see
me
and
then
dig
a
hole
in
the
sand
and
lie
in
it
until
i
was
a
mile
ahead
and
almost
out
of
sight
again
and
then
he
would
race
by
me
with
a
yelp
and
dig
another
hole
a
chileno
greaser
killed
that
little
dog
said
sandy
gazing
dreamily
across
the
landscape
and
i
never
got
a
chance
to
do
as
much
for
the
capinota
river
we
had
been
following
or
rather
for
two
days
came
to
an
village
exceedingly
restful
to
eyes
that
had
been
gazing
unbrokenly
on
the
desert
and
the
trail
struck
off
at
right
angles
up
a
branch
of
a
stream
milky
with
dust
that
night
we
camped
again
in
the
sand
at
the
end
of
the
haul
in
celebration
of
which
sandy
shaved
and
put
on
a
purple
neckcloth
to
scream
at
his
red
hair
there
i
took
leave
of
him
with
seventeen
miles
still
separating
me
from
cochabamba
it
was
not
the
problem
of
transporting
myself
but
rather
my
baggage
that
forced
me
to
trot
several
times
into
parotani
in
quest
of
a
in
vain
at
chances
one
takes
in
south
caught
a
total
stranger
bound
for
the
city
and
he
was
soon
lost
in
the
dust
ahead
with
all
my
possessions
on
the
crupper
of
his
mule
the
sweating
trail
with
its
plaguing
brook
grew
in
time
into
a
road
on
the
left
bank
huts
then
entire
villages
sprang
up
beside
me
troops
of
increased
to
an
almost
steady
stream
and
at
four
i
overtook
my
baggage
in
vinto
recovered
it
by
payment
of
a
and
was
soon
screaming
in
a
little
toy
train
on
a
track
at
the
terrifying
speed
of
an
hour
and
forty
minutes
for
the
twelve
miles
into
the
second
city
of
bolivia
chapter
xix
on
foot
across
tropical
bolivia
there
are
three
such
railroads
running
out
of
cochabamba
though
none
of
them
venture
more
than
a
few
miles
all
were
brought
up
piecemeal
on
muleback
or
on
massive
carts
like
the
first
steamers
on
titicaca
for
it
is
what
the
natives
call
a
mediterranean
town
one
is
a
steam
line
with
a
single
toy
locomotive
which
starts
every
hour
from
the
central
plaza
for
the
suburb
calacala
noted
for
its
baths
splitting
the
ears
with
its
infantile
shriek
and
spitting
hot
cinders
upon
all
the
in
the
vicinity
a
cochabambino
assured
me
that
i
could
not
believe
it
possible
this
enormous
locomotive
had
been
brought
from
germany
on
muleback
but
as
he
had
never
been
further
out
of
town
than
its
three
little
lines
could
carry
him
his
conception
of
locomotives
was
somewhat
atrophied
this
one
was
so
childlike
that
once
when
it
suddenly
started
up
as
i
was
crossing
the
street
i
unconsciously
put
out
a
hand
to
thrust
it
back
until
i
had
passed
cochabamba
inhabitants
by
its
own
count
the
majority
of
whom
have
never
left
its
suburbs
is
conceded
to
be
the
second
city
of
bolivia
and
considers
itself
the
first
after
the
south
american
fashion
it
is
constantly
quarrelling
with
la
paz
as
to
which
shall
furnish
the
country
its
president
a
truce
being
usually
patched
up
by
alternating
the
honor
the
population
of
bolivia
is
made
up
of
just
such
heterogeneous
groups
among
which
there
exists
a
profound
aversion
the
rivalry
is
particularly
tenacious
between
the
those
chiefly
of
the
aymará
race
inhabiting
the
or
northern
portion
of
the
country
bordering
on
titicaca
and
the
south
of
the
republic
containing
a
large
proportion
of
quichua
blood
and
partaking
of
many
of
the
characteristics
of
that
timid
dreamy
race
like
the
quichua
in
general
the
cochabambino
is
wedded
to
his
native
soil
with
an
ineradicable
affection
for
it
partly
because
isolation
keeps
its
customs
largely
unchanged
the
tongue
of
the
incas
is
still
the
chief
one
of
the
lower
classes
the
town
s
name
indeed
is
derived
from
the
quichua
words
lake
and
plain
the
conquistadores
as
usual
corrupted
by
pronouncing
it
as
if
they
had
a
cold
in
the
head
there
is
little
question
but
that
the
surrounding
valley
was
once
a
founded
in
the
place
was
christened
by
a
spanish
name
which
as
so
often
happened
in
south
america
failed
to
stick
it
has
a
restful
air
with
birds
singing
in
its
shaded
alamedas
reminding
one
faintly
of
granada
with
its
sand
and
cactus
and
soil
requiring
irrigation
the
little
river
cocha
wanders
by
the
north
and
east
sides
of
the
town
on
its
way
to
join
the
mamoré
the
surrounding
hills
are
less
brown
than
the
altiplanicie
with
trees
and
with
patches
of
green
running
up
the
sides
of
the
range
the
showers
were
no
highland
drizzles
but
perfect
sheets
of
water
for
an
hour
or
prospects
for
my
continued
travels
at
the
end
of
yet
it
is
a
colorless
place
compared
to
la
paz
adobe
is
the
chief
building
material
there
is
no
structure
of
great
importance
though
la
compañía
of
the
early
jesuits
has
the
usual
ornate
façade
its
houses
are
of
the
light
yellow
mud
of
the
surrounding
plain
less
painted
than
those
of
the
capital
and
even
the
tile
roofs
are
of
so
dull
and
dusty

red
as
scarcely
to
excite
the
eye
on
a
barren
knoll
at
the
back
of
the
town
is
a
ruined
adobe
once
large
and
ornate
and
still
higher
up
before
the
monument
to
the
heroes
of
cochabamba
the
gaze
stretches
away
across
a
yellowish
land
flat
as
a
sea
baking
in
the
blazing
sunshine
costumes
too
show
far
less
color
than
those

la
chola

a
similar

but
it
is
flatter
and
therefore
uglier
and
she
has
neither
the
immaculateness

for
pleasing
color
combinations
nor
the
sprightliness
of
her
aymará
cousin
natives
of
pure
caucasian
blood
are
so
rare
as
to
be
almost
conspicuous
important
commerce
is
largely
in
the
hands
of
germans
even
the
english
was
a
teuton
the
municipal
library
bore
a
large
sign
announcing
that
it
was
open
from
to
to
and
to
at
the
doddering
old
librarian
appeared
and
at
when
he
had
finished
reading
the
morning
paper
and
smoking
his
cigarette
he
put
on
his
hat
and
remarked
nos
vamos
señores
and
go
we
did
sure
enough
in
the
afternoon
and
evening
he
did
not
appear
cochabamba
has
been
called
the
paradise
of
priests
fat
men
of
the
cloth
swarm
and
the
town
is
rated
the
most
fanatical
in
bolivia
as
late
as
ten
years
ago
a
was
lighted
in
the
central
plaza
to
carry
out
an
de
against
a
protestant
who
had
dared
to
preach
his
doctrines
in
a
private
house
the
materials
for
the
inquisitorial
bonfire
being
the
holy
books
and
furniture
of
the
evangelist
the
troops
were
called
upon
to
interfere
and
prevented
the
consummation
of
the
act
but
they
were
not
able
to
keep
the
heretics
from
being
cruelly
stoned
by
the
populace
the
approach
of
the
railway
however
the
arrival
of
many
gringos
and
a
now
firmly
established
with
a
government
subsidy
is
wearing
down
somewhat
this
medieval
point
of
view
in
a
corner
of
the
main
plaza
of
cochabamba
where
the
sunshine
streaks
upon
it
through
the
trees
was
the
gringo
bench
a
rendezvous
at
which
there
was
always
to
be
found
at
least
an
american
and
an
odd
englishman
or
two
generally
miners
and
even
more
generally
penniless
for
bolivia
had
proved
less
golden
than
the
rumors
that
had
oozed
forth
from
her
interior
and
there
is
no
better
climate
than
that
of
cochabamba
in
which
to
sit
waiting
for
whatever
chooses
to
turn
up
next
at
the
time
of
my
arrival
the
bench
had
three
principal
occupants
the
most
permanent
fixture
was
old
man
simpson
over
eighty
not
merely
a
but
originally
from
the
same
town
in
which
i
had
spent
my
youth
indeed
he
was
still
a
subscriber
to
the
weekly
newspaper
i
had
earned
more
than
one
dollar
folding
and
a
who
had
drifted
from
california
to
chile
he
had
been
in
south
america
frequently
broke
more
years
than
i
had
been
on
earth
his
fortunes
rising
and
falling
with
miner
s
luck
and
his
spanish
still
atrocious
now
he
was
so
nearly
blind
that
he
could
recognize
us
one
from
another
only
by
our
voices
and
every
day
he
sat
from
sunrise
to
dusk
except
for
his
breakfast
and
siesta
from
eleven
to
one
in
the
shaded
corner
of
the
plaza
a
cud
of
in
one
cheek
his
gnarled
and
leathery
hands
folded
on
the
head
of
his
cane
all
day
long
he
would
weave
endless
tales
of
the
prospector
s
life
wandering
disconnectedly
over
all
the
western
side
of
the
continent
as
long
as
he
could
get
a
single
gringo
to
sit
and
listen
when
he
could
not
and
was
or
fancied
himself
alone
he
sat
hour
after
hour
motionless
murmuring
each
time
the
clock
in
the
tower
above
struck
well
it
s
o
clock
and
relapsing
again
into
silence
after
simpson
came
sampson
an
extraordinary
cockney
resourceful
full
of
quaint
sayings
of
a
strikingly
personal
philosophy
of
life
so
much
of
a
hustler
that
his
initiative
often
boiled
over
into
audacity
he
spoke
fluently
a
colloquial
spanish
and
considerable
quichua
chewed
coca
incessantly
and
came
close
to
being
the
ugliest
man
i
had
ever
set
eyes
upon
this
last
mentioned
quality
was
enhanced
by
the
clown
garb
he
wore
overalls
with
a
bib
some
remnants
of
shoes
here
and
there
about
his
feet
a
woolen
neckcloth
à
la
whitechapel
and
an
indian
felt
hat
on
the
back
of
his
bullet
head
his
view
of
life
he
summed
with
i
am
strictly
honest
i
never
tyke
anything
i
can
t
as
to
his
resourcefulness
in
this
identical
garb
he
had
gained
the
entrée
to
the
haughtiest
class
of
natives
with
whom
outward
appearances
constitute
some
and
had
talked
his
hypnotic
way
into
the
confidence
of
a
lawyer
and
of
cochabamba
to
such
an
extent
that
the
latter
contemplated
giving
him
charge
of
a
large
tract
of
land
to
plant
with
cotton
the
third
bencher
tommy
cox
had
been
down
inside
with
sampson
on
some
prospecting
scheme
that
had
failed
originally
from
toronto
he
was
in
appearance
and
speech
a
typical
englishman
a
little
fellow
of
the
antithesis
of
his
companion
in
initiative
of
so
dim
a
personality
compared
to
sampson
that
one
barely
noted
his
existence
when
the
two
were
together
when
i
arrived
in
cochabamba
nothing
was
more
certain
than
that
i
should
continue
my
tramp
down
the
andes
through
sucre
and
potosí
into
the
argentine
but
plans
do
not
keep
well
in
so
warm
a
climate
i
sat
one
day
musing
on
the
trip
ahead
of
me
when
sampson
cut
in
ere
if
you
re
looking
for
something
new
why
don
t
you
shoot
across
country
by
santa
cruz
to
the
paraguay
river
and
down
to
asunción
and
b
least
i
don
t
think
it
s
never
been
done
by
a
white
man
alone
and
the
idea
sprouted
i
suddenly
discovered
that
i
was
weary
of
high
altitudes
and
treeless
of
the
drear
sameness
of
the
andes
and
the
constant
repetition
of
the
that
inhabit
them
to
that
moment
i
had
like
most
of
the
world
conceived
of
bolivia
as
a
lofty
plateau
arid
and
cold
whereas
more
than
half
of
it
is
a
vast
tropical
lowland
spreading
away
from
the
slopes
of
the
andes
to
the
borders
of
brazil
paraguay
and
argentina
making
it
the
third
largest
country
of
south
america
there
was
it
seemed
a
fourth
way
of
entering
or
leaving
this
mediterranean
land
and
it
was
neither
by
way
of
mollendo
arica
nor
antofagasta
but
a
route
all
but
unknown
to
the
world
at
large
yet
followed
by
many
of
its
imports
and
exports
the
or
promised
a
new
type
of
people
a
new
style
of
life
a
knowledge
of
south
america
would
be
only
half
complete
without
including
in
my
itinerary
the
immense
and
wilderness
stretching
eastward
from
the
andes
i
wished
some
day
to
visit
paraguay
anyway
the
distance
to
puerto
suarez
was
evidently
greater
than
to
railhead
in
the
striking
an
average
of
varying
information
with
the
assistance
of
such
maps
as
the
local
librarian
gave
me
time
to
glance
over
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
roughly
on
the
other
hand
much
of
this
new
route
was
and
i
had
had
my
fill
of
climbing
over
such
labyrinths
of
mountain
ranges
as
lay
to
the
south
true
in
this
season
the
region
to
the
east
would
be
wet
and
muddy
but
with
no
bitter
cold
nights
in
prospect
i
could
throw
away
much
of
my
load
and
at
least
there
would
be
brilliant
sunshine
most
of
the
time
which
is
half
of
life
besides
is
not
the
chief
joy
of
travel
the
privilege
of
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
smashing
fixed
plans
to
replace
them
with
something
hitherto
undreamed
to
all
these
arguments
there
was
added
another
still
more
potent
when
i
began
to
make
inquiries
i
learned
that
the
proposed
trip
was
several
of
my
informants
quoted
recently
received
letters
to
prove
it
the
last
hundred
leagues
would
be
entirely
under
water
the
wild
indians
of
the
monte
grande
would
see
to
it
that
i
should
not
get
so
far
to
say
nothing
of
miles
of
tigers
and
swarms
of
even
more
savage
insects
and
many
days
without
food
or
human
habitation
that
settled
it
in
bogotá
the
tramp
down
the
andes
had
been
impossible
but
had
long
since
lost
completely
that
charming
quality
i
decided
to
strike
eastward
in
quest
of
the
paraguay
i
wouldn
t
mind
tackling
it
myself
sighed
tommy
when
i
mentioned
my
decision
to
the
benchers
i
m
badly
needed
in
b
a
but
i
m
stony
broke
of
course
if
i
could
find
anyone
who
would
take
along
a
man
as
excess
if
the
senator
doesn
t
make
up
his
wandering
bolivian
mind
soon
i
ll
quit
embellishing
this
plaza
myself
put
in
the
cockney
though
there
was
a
glint
in
his
eye
that
suggested
long
afterward
that
he
had
meant
the
hint
as
a
hoax
and
considered
the
trip
as
impossible
as
did
the
rest
of
cochabamba
were
i
to
have
a
companion
i
should
not
have
chosen
sampson
he
was
a
man
with
far
too
much
mind
of
his
own
to
be
good
company
in
an
uncivilized
wilderness
tommy
diffident
unresourceful
totally
lacking
in
initiative
without
wholly
innocent
of
spanish
to
all
appearance
tractable
and
harmless
was
much
to
be
preferred
moreover
he
was
better
looking
though
i
was
thinly
furnished
with
and
the
nearest
possible
source
of
supply
was
buenos
aires
i
concluded
that
the
code
of
forbade
me
to
leave
tommy
to
waste
away
on
the
gringo
bench
and
we
joined
forces
he
was
to
carry
his
proportionate
share
of
such
baggage
as
i
could
not
throw
away
including
the
tin
kitchenette
and
the
bottle
of
percent
alcohol
that
went
with
experience
proved
i
could
trust
him
with
me
thanks
also
to
the
offer
of
a
to
carry
the
to
santa
cruz
on
his
only
a
moderate
load
i
should
have
bought
a
donkey
or
another
rather
than
turn
ourselves
into
but
for
two
reasons
first
such
a
purchase
would
have
relieved
me
of
most
of
the
billetes
i
had
left
secondly
the
fate
of
cleopatra
and
chusquito
caused
me
to
doubt
whether
any
animal
could
endure
the
journey
it
was
two
months
from
the
day
i
had
walked
into
cuzco
that
one
of
cochabamba
s
toy
trains
carried
us
past
adobe
towns
and
mud
fences
with
huts
that
gave
the
scene
an
oriental
touch
and
set
us
down
in
punata
in
time
for
dinner
in
the
where
tommy
had
once
before
washed
down
a
similar
plate
of
stringy
roast
pork
with
a
glass
of
chicha
then
we
swung
on
our
packs
and
struck
eastward
into
the
unknown
beyond
arani
next
morning
came
the
real
parting
of
the
ways
the
trail
that
swung
to
the
right
along
the
base
of
the
hills
went
on
to
sucre
and
the
silver
mountain
that
by
which
we
zigzagged
up
the
face
of
a
stony
range
led
across
the
continent
here
the
mountains
closed
in
and
the
vast
fertile
yet
dreary
and
desolate
plain
of
cochabamba
that
had
seemed
to
stretch
out
interminably
in
the
brilliant
sunshine
disappeared
at
length
below
a
swell
of
land
and
was
lost
forever
behind
us
for
a
week
the
going
was
not
unlike
that
down
the
andes
though
it
grew
gradually
lower
as
the
endless
ridges
of
the
eastern
slope
calmed
down
slowly
like
the
waves
of
some
tempestuous
sea
it
was
only
on
the
road
that
i
began
really
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
tommy
in
spite
of
his
canadian
birth
he
dressed
like
a
liverpool
with
a
heavy
cap
a
kerchief
about
his
neck
and
a
heavy
winter
is
w
stc
t
he
could
not
be
induced
to
shed
however
hot
the
climate
though
he
readily
enough
removed
his
coat
he
spoke
with
a
strong
english
accent
and
a
man
following
behind
with
a
basket
could
have
picked
up
enough
h
s
to
have
started
a
of
those
scarce
articles
in
whitechapel
itself
he
had
given
cochabamba
ample
opportunity
to
show
its
gratitude
at
his
departure
but
the
fourteen
of
his
last
eleemosynary
gleanings
turned
out
to
be
barely
sufficient
to
keep
him
in
cigarettes
on
the
journey
his
share
of
the
load
he
carried
in
the
half
of
a
hectic
tablecloth
of
mysterious
origin
tied
across
his
chest
as
an
indian
woman
carries
her
latest
offspring
his
own
possessions
consisted
wholly
and
exclusively
of
a
large
trowel
for
tommy
was
by
profession
a
bricklayer
and
mason
this
general
convenience
weapon
sign
of
caste
and
hope
of
better
days
to
come
he
wore
through
the
band
of
his
trousers
as
the
bolivian
peon
carries
his
long
knife
and
the
services
it
performed
were
unlimited
i
was
never
nearer
throwing
my
kodak
into
a
than
when
it
failed
to
catch
tommy
solemnly
eating
eggs
with
the
point
of
his
faithful
trowel
the
hospitality
of
the
bolivian
soon
proved
low
even
in
comparison
with
the
rest
of
the
andes
and
every
meal
and
lodging
cost
us
a
struggle
at
pocona
for
example
i
ended
a
walk
down
the
nose
of
a
range
on
which
a
coach
road
descended
by
s
s
to
a
narrow
valley
bottom
below
tommy
had
fallen
behind
and
i
had
begun
to
wonder
whether
he
could
endure
the
pace
our
scantiness
of
funds
made
necessary
as
i
debouched
into
the
plaza
i
paused
to
ask
a
person
drowsing
before
one
of
the
doors
where
one
could
find
a
night
s
lodging
he
silently
projected
his
lips
toward
a
building
before
which
stood
the
empty
there
a
group
of
supercilious
unwashed
cholos
of
varying
stages
of
insobriety
informed
me
with
an
air
that
plainly
said
we
are
purposely
deceiving
you
first
that
there
was
no
tambo
in
town
then
that
there
was
accommodation
only
for
travelers
á
for
horsemen
only
eh
i
cried
in
the
voice
natural
to
an
fast
where
does
the
corregidor
live
what
are
gobernadores
in
peru
become
corregidores
in
bolivia
down
the
street
mouthed
a
fellow
with
a
lazy
toss
of
the
head
in
no
particular
direction
i
snatched
a
youth
out
of
the
group
and
pushed
him
before
me
some
way
down
the
cobbles
he
halted
at
the
open
door
of
the
usual
slatternly
room
saying
the
corregidor
lives
go
in
and
fetch
him
i
answered
blocking
his
attempted
retreat
he
called
out
two
or
three
times
in
the
singsong
with
which
neighbors
greet
neighbors
in
the
andes
then
obeyed
my
order
to
enter
and
summon
the
authority
least
he
disappeared
inside
the
building
some
time
later
two
chola
girls
appeared
at
the
door
to
ask
in
pretended
surprise
what
i
desired
where
is
the
corregidor
he
is
in
the
country
he
doesn
t
live
here
they
replied
respectively
in
one
breath
betraying
themselves
by
their
carelessness
in
not
rehearsing
the
reply
before
appearing
where
is
the
boy
who
brought
me
here
the
back
i
had
long
ago
learned
this
trick
of
local
authorities
in
andean
villages
of
hiding
away
at
the
approach
of
a
stranger
bearing
orders
from
the
government
and
the
complicity
of
all
the
population
in
the
concealment
but
i
had
learned
also
one
means
of
bringing
him
to
light
i
marched
into
the
house
and
throwing
my
pack
on
an
adobe
divan
covered
with
blankets
announced
that
i
should
sleep
there
the
cholas
would
call
the
corregidor
at
once
they
had
called
him
they
couldn
t
call
him
he
was
coming
in
a
minute
he
did
not
live
in
town
and
a
dozen
other
falsehoods
poured
in
a
chaotic
flood
from
their
lips
for
an
hour
i
held
to
the
divan
but
as
evening
settled
down
it
became
evident
that
the
ruse
of
peru
would
not
work
in
bolivia
that
though
i
might
sleep
there
by
force
i
should
remain
thirsty
and
hungry
i
shouldered
my
bundle
and
hobbled
back
to
the
plaza
there
ten
centavos
spent
for
chicha
convinced
the
sceptical
inhabitants
that
i
was
not
penniless
and
in
time
it
paved
the
way
to
a
request
for
food
cómo
no
came
the
mechanical
answer
and
a
long
time
after
dark
a
big
bowl
of
broth
of
temperature
but
sizzling
hot
with
was
followed
by
some
hashed
black
or
frozen
potatoes
mixed
with
an
egg
and
some
bread
how
much
do
i
owe
i
asked
when
i
finished
setenta
está
bién
and
who
is
going
to
sleep
on
those
beds
i
continued
pointing
to
the
long
adobe
divans
each
with
a
roll
of
thin
mattress
and
blankets
at
either
end
of
the
room
no
one
how
much
do
you
charge
for
a
bed
un
boliviano
no
más
replied
the
chola
in
that
droning
soothing
voice
in
which
the
andean
always
names
an
exorbitant
price
which
he
knows
the
traveler
can
not
refuse
to
pay
voy
á
tender
no
yes
spread
it
i
was
stripping
to
crawl
into
the
star
bed
of
the
which
only
horsemen
are
there
sounded
at
the
door
i
had
fastened
ajar
with
a
bench
the
worn
and
humble
voice
of
tommy
having
fallen
behind
because
of
a
ankle
he
had
stumbled
on
into
town
down
that
stony
looping
descent
which
i
had
found
bad
enough
even
by
day
fortunately
there
was
a
bit
of
cold
broth
and
some
chuño
left
after
devouring
which
he
turned
in
on
the
other
divan
next
day
we
passed
a
plain
with
a
few
huts
on
which
to
practice
my
neglected
quichua
and
early
in
the
afternoon
reached
totora
so
named
from
a
long
rush
which
grows
in
swampy
ground
it
is
the
largest
town
between
cochabamba
and
santa
cruz
and
capital
of
a
province
with
several
thousand
inhabitants
set
in
a
hollow
of
the
treeless
hills
it
was
dreary
and
colorless
as
a
mining
town
with
breakneck
cobbled
streets
and
a
little
plaza
surrounded
by
what
tommy
called
drapers
shops
all
with
the
selfsame
display
of
bayeta
and
other
cloths
the
vista
of
many
a
street
was
enlivened
by
swinging
red
signs
like
japanese
or
chinese
banners
above
the
doors
where
chicha
was
for
sale
far
better
and
almost
given
away
in
colombia
this
native
drink
had
come
to
cost
twice
what
a
larger
glass
of
beer
would
in
the
united
states
in
the
upper
corner
of
the
plaza
we
spread
ourselves
at
ease
on
a
shaded
bench
around
the
in
the
center
of
the
square
a
constant
crowd
carrying
earthen
jars
fought
for
the
two
trickles
of
water
behind
us
stood
what
dared
to
call
itself
the
hotel
union
consisting
of
a
and
an
absent
proprietor
who
according
to
the
disinterested
cholas
might
be
back
during
the
evening
to
discuss
with
us
our
offer
to
spend
the
night
with
him
the
neighboring
tambo
was
closed
because
of
a
wedding
in
the
family
so
rare
a
ceremony
in
bolivia
that
we
had
not
the
heart
to
complain
tommy
tired
of
sitting
and
went
to
lie
down
in
frank
hobo
fashion
in
the
plaza
as
dusk
came
on
we
made
a
round
of
the
shops
warned
that
there
would
be
none
for
some
days
ahead
we
bought
eggs
and
blocks
of
crude
sugar
now
called
coca
to
chew
when
thirsty
several
loaves
of
the
bread
that
weighed
us
down
like
grindstones
and
some
shelled
peanuts
which
we
found
next
day
to
be
unroasted
any
chip
of
stone
or
scrap
of
iron
served
as
weights
in
the
shops
though
some
had
brass
cups
full
of
shot
over
which
a
paper
was
pasted
by
the
rare
government
inspector
soon
to
break
itself
until
he
came
again
that
purchaser
who
got
twelve
ounces
to
his
pound
was
as
lucky
as
the
one
whose
came
anywhere
near
being
a
yard
long
a
weight
was
commonly
the
heaviest
on
hand
and
the
old
woman
who
sold
us
sugar
poured
that
amount
in
with
the
weight
in
the
other
side
of
the
scales
and
so
on
until
she
had
made
up
the
unprecedented
quantity
we
demanded
a
telegraph
wire
strode
over
the
hills
with
us
on
the
twenty
broken
and
panting
miles
to
duraznillo
across
a
flanking
valley
the
range
was
mottled
with
all
colors
from
deep
red
to
the
depths
of
its
gullies
purple
under
dense
while
all
the
rest
of
the
world
lay
in
brilliant
sunshine
and
vast
banks
of
clouds
took
on
fantastic
shapes
which
the
imagination
could
animate
into
all
manner
of
strange
beings
or
people
with
innumerable
plots
and
one
mighty
descent
brought
us
to
a
river
but
at
the
very
moment
we
reached
it
it
turned
suddenly
muddy
from
rains
somewhere
in
the
hills
above
and
spoiled
our
plan
for
a
bathe
as
tommy
expressed
it
in
the
dry
burning
hills
beyond
my
companion
went
astray
but
found
himself
again
by
following
my
footsteps
he
had
so
little
initiative
that
he
would
not
lead
the
way
and
his
favorite
plan
of
plodding
at
my
very
heels
having
been
vetoed
as
he
did
not
mix
well
with
the
landscape
he
commonly
trailed
a
behind
usually
taking
care
not
to
lose
sight
of
me
duraznillo
had
a
public
that
had
once
been
an
adobe
chapel
but
which
was
now
as
bare
as
a
millionaire
s
room
in
heaven
i
boiled
oatmeal
and
eggs
in
the
water
tommy
brought
from
a
stagnant
pool
not
far
away
but
waited
in
vain
for
the
return
of
the
only
resident
who
had
volunteered
to
arrange
as
the
shades
of
night
spread
the
floor
looked
harder
and
harder
and
in
nosing
about
we
were
astonished
to
discover
several
mattresses
covering
a
pile
of
adobe
bricks
in
the
back
of
the
chief
house
of
the
village
apparently
uninhabited
still
it
was
possible
that
the
local
authority
would
in
time
come
out
of
hiding
and
we
lolled
patiently
if
in
the
moonlight
we
had
waited
perhaps
eight
though
without
a
watch
it
seemed
hours
later
when
patience
ceased
to
be
a
virtue
and
we
slipped
through
a
hole
in
the
mud
fence
each
to
embrace
a
mattress
it
may
be
that
a
trap
had
been
set
for
us
as
we
approached
the
wall
again
an
unusually
large
wrapped
in
a
poncho
loomed
up
on
the
other
side
and
shouted
in
an
authoritative
voice
what
are
you
doing
inside
that
fence
now
i
do
not
like
any
man
to
address
me
in
that
tone
least
of
all
a
south
american
indian
it
is
neither
good
training
for
his
own
primitive
character
nor
advantageous
to
future
gringo
travelers
speaking
to
me
indio
i
demanded
i
am
corregidor
of
duraznillo
also
guardian
of
this
corregidor
then
you
are
the
very
fellow
we
have
been
looking
for
these
last
four
hours
you
will
kindly
lend
us
two
mattresses
to
sleep
i
will
not
lend
you
mattress
to
sleep
on
what
are
you
doing
plainly
he
was
of
aymará
rather
than
meek
quichua
blood
and
where
have
you
been
hiding
yourself
señor
corregidor
we
have
a
letter
for
you
from
the
ugh
he
snorted
with
an
effort
at
sarcasm
let
s
see
that
letter
from
the
it
is
in
my
pack
in
the
bring
it
over
since
when
have
caballeros
run
after
indians
to
show
them
government
orders
are
you
going
to
lend
us
two
mattresses
not
one
tommy
chuck
them
he
did
so
with
trembling
hands
for
something
had
given
the
diminutive
bricklayer
an
extraordinary
respect
for
the
corregidor
followed
at
our
heels
bellowing
as
we
carried
our
finds
into
the
and
spread
them
out
a
stocky
youth
and
a
woman
with
a
flickering
candle
appeared
behind
him
in
the
doorway
and
the
indian
demanded
my
papers
can
you
read
i
asked
i
can
he
snarled
which
he
could
to
the
extent
of
spelling
out
the
order
at
about
a
line
a
minute
bien
he
admitted
at
last
in
a
surly
voice
but
you
are
to
ask
for
things
not
take
from
a
corregidor
who
hides
himself
and
the
prefect
orders
that
you
be
furnished
what
you
need
a
just
he
added
triumphantly
ignoring
my
reply
then
you
will
pay
two
bolivianos
for
each
very
well
but
you
will
first
make
out
a
receipt
for
that
amount
that
i
may
send
it
back
to
the
it
was
not
the
first
time
i
had
played
this
unfailing
card
against
an
andean
authority
attempting
extortion
he
knew
he
was
beaten
for
though
he
could
read
after
a
bolivian
fashion
he
probably
could
not
write
and
certainly
would
not
dare
let
such
a
document
reach
the
prefect
like
a
true
however
he
saved
his
face
as
long
as
possible
very
well
give
me
some
paper
to
write
it
as
corregidor
you
should
furnish
your
own
paper
i
have
well
you
may
use
one
mattress
but
not
two
he
growled
you
lose
in
country
we
are
not
accustomed
to
sleep
two
on
the
same
a
shiver
of
rage
seemed
to
pass
over
him
while
his
castilian
pride
struggled
for
expression
behind
his
mask
of
indian
features
then
he
faded
away
into
the
night
and
was
heard
no
more
though
i
was
not
so
certain
of
him
as
not
to
prop
a
heavy
wooden
beam
against
the
door
in
such
a
way
that
an
attempt
to
sneak
in
upon
us
during
the
night
would
quite
likely
have
been
followed
in
the
morning
by
the
intruder
s
funeral
spiral
descents
so
steep
we
had
to
set
the
brakes
constantly
making
our
thighs
ache
brought
us
at
last
to
a
hot
and
stony
across
which
a
river
snaked
its
way
incessantly
we
stuffed
leggings
and
into
our
bundles
and
walked
all
the
rest
of
the
day
barefoot
in
our
unlaced
boots
crossing
the
stream
perhaps
a
hundred
times
and
envying
the
natives
as
often
as
we
paused
to
pull
on
our
footwear
tommy
found
it
too
much
trouble
to
roll
down
his
trousers
after
each
crossing
and
complained
of
sunburned
legs
for
days
to
come
but
at
least
the
going
was
level
the
stillness
and
lack
of
population
recalled
jaen
in
the
far
north
of
peru
for
hours
we
tramped
stonily
between
ever
lower
hills
only
the
mournful
note
of
the
breaking
the
silence
the
first
gnats
and
insects
we
were
doomed
to
endure
more
and
more
as
we
advanced
to
the
eastward
began
to
annoy
us
as
scrub
trees
thickened
bird
life
grew
more
prevalent
bands
of
parrakeets
screamed
by
as
always
along
these
dry
tropical
now
and
then
a
parrot
or
two
forerunners
of
many
to
come
passed
overhead
the
rare
huts
squatting
in
scant
patches
of
shade
were
now
of
mere
poles
to
sleep
in
them
was
far
less
inviting
than
to
lie
on
the
ground

but
the
andes
did
not
subside
so
easily
next
morning
the
trail
shook
off
the
river
and
climbed
wearily
to
a
puna
then
dropped
by
a
into
another
cañon
with
a
muddy
lukewarm
brook
only
to
pant
upward
again
to
another
summit
several
times
each
day
we
sweated
to
a
hilltop
and
lay
down
in
a
cool
breeze
we
should
not
often
enjoy
in
the
days
to
come

the

recalled

inhospitable

tucked
away
in
the
undergrowth
yet
surely
if
slowly
the
andes
were
flattening
down
and
each
summit
was
less
lofty
than
the
preceding
one
afternoon
passing
arrieros
told
us
that
three
of
our
were
not
far
ahead
we
increased
our
pace
and
strode
at
five
with
thirty
miles
in
our
legs
into
the
miserable
mud
town
of
chilón
in
the
corral
and
corredor
back
through
one
of
the
dismal
dwellings

found

with

these

seeker
after

a

passes
the
buck
by
sending
the
inquirer
on
to
someone
else
the
traveler
who
has
lived
for
days
chiefly
on
the
anticipation
of
what
he
will
eat
in
the
town
he
has
been
assured
is
provided
with
everything
is
fortunate
to
collect
the
ingredients
of
even
one
real
meal
and
that
only
at
the
expense
of
wandering
from
door
to
door
like
a
buddhist
priest
with
his
chilón
was
even
more
anemic
and
indifferent
than
usual
it
is
rated
the
most
region
of
bolivia
and
the
government
has
striven
in
vain
to
drive
out
the
almost
universal
by
planting
the
eucalyptus
and
sending
doctors
to
study
its
cause
the
only
water
to
be
had
was
a
yellow
liquid
mud
dipped
up
in
the
back
yard
kimball
prepared
to
cook
in
it
some
of
the
he
had
bought
at
blockade
prices
only
to
bring
to
light
a
swarm
of
maggots
a
can
of
peaches
from
time
in
the
last
two
bolivianos
four
ounces
of
tea
a
boliviano
a
pound
of
sugar
as
much
and
at
that
it
was
a
coarse
dirty
stony
stuff
so
hard
an
ax
was
required
to
break
it
one
slattern
a
bit
less
sullen
in
aspect
than
the
town
in
general
asked
if
we
knew
how
to
eat
and
we
assured
her
we
knew
how
to
eat
anything
we
could
get
our
fingers
on
and
she
set
before
us
a
single
plate
of
boiled
shelled
corn
and
little
cubes
of
fried
fat
pork
which
we
ate
with
the
spoons
nature
had
provided
us
in
the
entire
town
we
gleaned
two
whole
eggs
most
of
the
huts
that
displayed
them
answered
with
that
clumsy
old
andean
lie
son
belong
to
some
one
a
woman
squatting
behind
one
of
the
huts
admitted
she
had
eggs
to
sell
but
said
she
did
not
feel
like
getting
up
to
sell
them
that
was
the
attitude
of
all
chilón
it
may
be
that
the
hookworm
as
well
as
the
was
prevalent
when
i
awoke
at
dawn
kimball
in
retaliation
for
the
state
of
the
charqui
had
already
picked
a
chicken
from
one
of
the
trees
in
the
corral
and
managed
to
stuff
it
into
his
alforjas
without
a
squawk
by
the
time
we
were
off
it
began
to
rain
a
road
splashed
and
skated
away
through
scrub
woods
caking
our
feet
with
mud
and
soaking
our
garments
from
both
inside
and
out
in
spite
of
the
rain
the
tropical
heat
weighed
down
upon
us
like
blankets
and
nowhere
was
there
water
to
drink
rarely
among
the
spiny
scrub
trees
we
came
upon
a
miserable
hut
of
poles
and
sticks
in
each
of
which
lounged
a
dozen
or
so
of
the
colorless
mongrel
natives
of
the
region
was
being
cooked
in
one
such
hovel
and
though
the
householders
showed
no
joy
or
any
other
species
of
emotion
at
our
presence
when
the
meal
was
ready
a
small
of
rice
charqui
and
pepper
stew
was
set
on
the
ground
before
us
and
we
were
each
silently
handed
a
wooden
spoon
there
was
of
course
no
bread
but
a
gourd
bowl
of
was
added
for
our
competition
this
was
one
contest
in
which
tommy
was
easily
my
superior
the
languid
chola
would
not
accept
payment
for
the
food
though
she
did
so
readily
enough
for
the
chica
we
had
drunk
calling
up
to
tommy
memories
of
the
land
of
free
lunch
so
that
several
times
during
the
blazing
afternoon
i
heard
his
voice
torturing
the
wilderness
behind
me
with
his
own
version
of
a
broadway
favorite
me
back
to
new
york
town
not
two
hours
beyond
we
drifted
into
a
hacienda
and
before
i
knew
it
tommy
had
told
his
tale
so
feelingly
to
the
italian
owner
who
had
the
misfortune
to
understand
a
little
english
that
we
must
go
in
and
have
a
plate
of
cold
spaghetti
imported
to
these
wilds
at
prices
best
of
all
after
nothing
better
than
liquid
mud
for
days
was
several
glasses
of
almost
clear
water
the
italian
was
bubbling
over
about
some
new
invention
by
one
of
his
countrymen
that
would
forever
abolish
war
half
the
world
might
be
abolished
without
our
hearing
of
it
in
these
wilds
before
we
left
he
inquired
whether
we
had
quinine
and
forced
upon
tommy
a
box
of
pills
with
the
urgent
advice
to
take
one
every
morning
i
had
already
begun
to
dose
myself
daily
but
was
never
able
to
convince
my
companion
that
ills
might
be
forestalled
far
more
easily
than
they
could
be
ousted
after
they
had
staked
their
claims
it
was
december
the
longest
day
of
the
year
and
the
sun
was
still
high
when
we
again
overtook
our
paisanos
camped
this
time
along
a
corredor
under
the
projecting
eaves
of
a
large
among
scrub
trees
and
scattered
huts
to
the
right
of
the
trail
the
building
was
imposing
for
the
region
for
the
owner
held
title
to
a
vast
tract
and
many
cattle
i
recalled
the
plump
hospitality
of
many
a
similar
hacendado
of
peru
but
was
quickly
reminded
that
we
were
in
bolivia
our
paisanos
had
already
eaten
having
come
on
foot
tommy
and
i
were
too
low
caste
to
be
invited
into
the
with
the
swarming
family
after
much
reconnoitering
i
found
a
hut
where
a
lean
chicken
could
be
bought
at
a
high
price
and
the
señora
of
the
hacienda
grudgingly
agreed
to
have
her
servants
cook
it
here
too
the
only
water
was
a
thick
yellow
liquid
flowing
behind
the
house
and
common
to
all
its
animals
at
sight
of
it
we
had
abandoned
our
plan
to
bathe
yet
we
must
drink
it
and
cook
in
it
the
apathy
of
life
in
these
parts
is
exemplified
by
the
fact
that
an
hacendado
of
comparative
wealth
will
drink
mud
all
his
life
rather
than
dig
a
well
long
after
dark
an
unwashed
chola
came
waddling
into
the
corredor
with
a
single
bowl
of
charqui
stew
and
two
wooden
spoons
tommy
fell
upon
this
gratefully
as
he
would
have
upon
a
bone
discarded
by
a
dog
personally
i
was
not
pleased
with
the
metamorphosis
the
fowl
had
undergone
and
calling
out
the
haughty
hacendado
i
thrust
a
handful
of
bills
toward
him
asking
if
he
could
not
sell
us
something
fit
to
eat
even
if
he
did
want
the
chicken
for
himself
the
hint
caused
him
to
turn
a
livid
green
these
landowners
of
the
interior
too
proud
to
sell
food
to
travelers
are
yet
too
to
give
it
away
and
a
lifetime
on
their
own
broad
if
worthless
acres
with
only
a
few
cringing
indians
about
them
lording
it
over
even
their
own
women
causes
them
to
consider
themselves
vastly
superior
to
all
mankind
and
to
treat
travelers
accordingly
so
thoroughly
had
i
ruffled
his
pomposity
that
the
fellow
visibly
shaking
with
anger
went
to
sit
under
a
scraggly
tree
in
the
grassless
sand
before
the
house
and
rage
in
silence
then
took
to
pacing
back
and
forth
in
and
out
of
the
building
and
kept
it
up
until
well
into
the
morning
he
might
have
vented
his
rage
more
effectually
for
law
has
but
slight
foothold
in
these
wild
regions
but
for
the
revolvers
rifles
and
pistols
lying
about
us
in
the
corredor
meanwhile
a
servant
brought
my
chicken
in
a
pot
and
though
it
was
tougher
than
life
in
bolivia
we
drank
the
broth
and
hung
the
remnants
of
the
fowl
to
a
rafter
above
our
heads
out
of
reach
of
dogs
indians
or
ants
it
rained
most
of
the
night
and
the
wood
we
could
find
in
the
chill
dawn
was
so
wet
that
it
was
a
good
hour
before
we
boiled
tea
and
rice
in
the
yellow
coaxed
tommy
to
get
up
in
time
to
eat
barely
two
hundred
yards
beyond
we
came
to
the
muddy
river
must
unshoe
the
feet
we
had
just
carefully
shod
for
the
day
and
had
a
provoking
task
dressing
them
again
on
the
further
bank
tommy
went
to
hunt
are
to
be
had
in
these
parts
only
by
inquiring
at
each
hut
until
one
has
found
some
old
woman
who
has
inadvertently
rolled
a
dozen
or
two
beyond
her
own
it
was
hours
later
that
he
overtook
me
we
undulated
on
over
country
a
desert
without
sight
or
sound
of
human
life
grown
with
thousands
of
immense
cactus
trees
of
the
species
from
which
fell
myriads
of
an
apple
tommy
called
it
the
outer
spines
of
which
fall
off
when
ripe
the
juicy
interior
full
of
tiny
black
seeds
with
mildly
the
taste
of
strawberries
effective
at
least
in
quenching
the
thirst
at
a
scattered
cluster
of
huts
called
mataral
we
found
a
group
of
drunken
indians
male
and
female
celebrating
the
customary
wake
in
and
about
a
hut
where
a
baby
had
died
the
corpse
of
the
lay
and
half
naked
on
a
bare
table
a
lighted
candle
on
either
side
of
its
head
its
nostrils
stuffed
with
cotton
and
already
beginning
to
make
its
presence
known
to
another
of
the
five
senses
while
all
about
the
premises
rolled
maudlin
only
too
glad
of
any
excuse
for
consuming
gallons
of
overripe
chicha
outside
a
cholo
was
piecing
a
coffin
together
from
the
odds
and
ends
of
boxes
that
had
once
held
foreign
imports
the
priest
s
assurance
that
infants
properly
baptized
go
directly
to
heaven
makes
such
a
death
the
cause
almost
for
rejoicing
among
the
ignorant
population
of
bolivia
even
if
it
leads
to
nothing
worse
than
passive
infanticide
frequent
ridges
and
a
stream
that
forced
us
to
unshoe
and
shoe
a
score
of
times
reddening
our
legs
where
our
leggings
should
have
been
decidedly
reduced
our
pace
not
without
surprise
therefore
did
i
sight
at
dusk
among
the
trees
on
a
low
bluff
across
a
nearly
waterless
a
village
of
moderate
size
thirty
miles
from
where
we
had
started
in
the
morning
it
was
pampa
grande
my
had
already
commandeered
a
mud
room
on
a
corner
of
the
second
street
and
chucked
their
possessions
into
it
among
the
luxuries
the
place
offered
was
bread
soggy
and
gritty
dark
of
complexion
as
the
inhabitants
but
bread
for
all
that
while
we
were
swallowing
chunks
of
this
and
of
some
one
discovered
that
it
was
christmas
eve
a
celebration
was
imperative
kimball
dug
up
an
ancient
fife
from
his
pack
i
still
possessed
a
battered
and
all
but
owen
who
had
none
lent
their
voices
to
the
lusty
if
not
musical
carols
that
astonished
the
apathetic
hamlet
so
thoroughly
that
a
few
found
energy
to
gather
in
a
drooping
group
in
the
noiseless
street
outside
we
ended
with
our
patriotic
anthem
in
the
midst
of
which
kimball
s
fife
suddenly
broke
off
its
wail
long
enough
for
him
to
assure
tommy
here
young
feller
don
t
get
it
into
your
nut
that
s
gawd
save
no
king
we
re
treatin
these
greasers
to
the
prospectors
pushed
on
in
the
morning
but
finding
ourselves
a
day
ahead
of
our
schedule
and
that
we
could
still
reach
santa
cruz
before
the
end
of
the
year
we
decided
to
spend
christmas
in
pampa
grande
it
was
ideal
christmas
weather
the
village
stands
on
the
eighteenth
parallel
at
an
altitude
of
some
feet
giving
it
a
soft
midsummer
air
with
a
caressing
breeze
and
a
most
restful
atmosphere
life
had
slowed
down
to
a
snail
s
pace
the
inhabitants
were
too
indolent
to
make
a
noise
or
disturbance
even
our
neighbors
were
too
apathetic
to
come
and
satisfy
their
curiosity
by
staring
at
us
lying
on
the
adobe
couch
under
the
eaves
we
could
let
our
eyes
roam
lazily
over
the
surrounding
sandy
country
of
unabrupt
hills
utterly
silent
but
for
the
occasional
faint
note
of
the
mourning
but
the
question
was
christmas
dinner
the
boyish
corregidor
was
duly
impressed
by
my
papers
and
assured
me
we
could
have
anything
we
might
i
took
him
at
his
word
and
handed
over
a
boliviano
with
a
request
for
eggs
he
called
in
a
sandaled
youth
and
sent
him
away
with
orders
to
round
up
a
basketful
then
he
wandered
home
after
a
time
the
youth
came
shuffling
back
to
say
he
could
not
find
a
single
egg
and
thrust
the
coin
toward
me
i
was
too
experienced
an
andean
traveler
to
accept
it
and
thus
absolve
the
authorities
of
any
further
aid
blocked
in
his
turn
the
corregidor
came
again
in
person
to
suggest
a
chicken
at
a
boliviano
my
extravagance
in
accepting
this
offer
startled
him
but
he
dropped
the
coin
deftly
into
my
hand
and
hurried
languidly
off
ostensibly
to
look
for
the
fowl
really
to
sneak
home
by
a
roundabout
route
he
could
not
be
blamed
much
for
such
conduct
appointed
by
force
and
obliged
to
serve
without
emoluments
the
rural
authority
lives
between
two
millstones
the
lower
composed
of
his
and
lifelong
friends
with
whom
he
must
continue
his
existence
a
far
more
tangible
and
permanent
reality
than
the
somewhat
nebulous
government
that
furnishes
travelers
with
imperative
orders
from
la
paz
or
cochabamba
but
a
christmas
dinner
is
nothing
to
grow
sentimental
or
sympathetic
about
when
i
had
loafed
and
drowsed
and
read
an
hour
or
more
longer
i
wandered
a
few
yards
up
the
sandy
street
to
the
corregidor
s
hut
no
he
mourned
regretfully
from
his
hammock
i
have
not
been
able
to
find
a
chicken
nobody
wants
to
but
señor
corregidor
i
protested
we
haven
t
a
thing
with
which
to
make
dinner
and
the
minister
of
the
interior
in
la
paz
told
the
official
name
brought
him
slowly
from
the
hammock
to
his
feet
a
worried
look
on
his
face
very
well
he
sighed
then
we
will
make
you
an
almuerzo
here
in
my
house
which
is
your
not
at
all
señor
we
would
not
dream
of
troubling
you
but
if
you
have
wherewith
to
make
an
almuerzo
let
us
have
the
ingredients
and
we
will
cook
them
to
suit
well
there
is
don
t
mention
it
we
don
t
want
to
insult
our
stomachs
even
on
christmas
i
was
speaking
of
well
there
is
a
house
down
at
the
edge
of
the
river
where
they
have
killed
a
yes
three
days
ago
and
the
lump
of
it
my
compatriots
bought
this
morning
all
but
lifted
the
roof
off
our
hut
a
slice
carved
out
of
the
middle
of
it
was
the
yellow
dog
that
picked
up
both
chunks
of
it
when
we
threw
it
into
the
street
may
have
had
the
christmas
dinner
of
his
life
but
he
is
not
likely
to
see
ay
diós
señor
then
there
is
nothing
now
for
the
good
of
pampa
grande
i
advise
you
there
are
plenty
of
chickens
in
the
people
will
not
sell
the
only
way
is
for
you
to
go
out
and
shoot
one
with
your
i
never
risk
my
aim
on
anything
smaller
than
a
bullock
cartridges
are
expensive
in
the
wilds
of
such
gringo
persistency
was
annoying
native
travelers
needed
only
to
be
told
the
same
lie
two
or
three
times
before
they
left
him
in
peace
to
drowse
in
his
hammock
with
a
badly
concealed
sigh
he
wandered
into
the
street
and
led
the
way
across
the
noiseless
sanded
plaza
to
the
house
of
his
friend
the
alcalde
the
two
conferred
together
and
finally
sent
out
a
cholo
with
orders
to
run
down
a
anybody
s
at
the
emissary
returned
by
and
by
to
report
that
he
could
not
find
one
the
pair
looked
at
me
as
much
as
to
say
there
you
see
the
last
hope
has
i
ignored
the
hint
in
despair
they
called
in
another
cholo
and
with
a
mumbled
order
handed
him
a
shotgun
a
long
time
later
a
report
was
heard
some
distance
off
the
two
officials
shivered
by
and
by
the
cholo
returned
with
the
shotgun
and
announced
that
it
was
badly
he
said
nothing
about
the
aiming
the
officials
looked
at
me
imploringly
i
remained
like
a
statue
of
patience
seated
on
a
cactus
at
last
the
alcalde
with
the
air
of
a
member
of
a
suicide
club
who
has
drawn
the
black
bean
snatched
up
the
gun
and
calling
upon
the
cholo
to
follow
disappeared
into
the
sunshine
for
a
time
only
the
chirp
of
an
insect
in
the
thatch
above
sounded
then
a
shot
was
heard
and
a
moment
later
the
alcalde
dodged
into
the
room
like
a
man
pursued
by
bandits
thrust
the
weapon
quickly
under
a
reed
mat
and
assumed
his
seat
and
his
most
innocent
air
legally
he
might
shoot
all
his
neighbors
chickens
on
government
order
practically
he
was
not
anxious
to
be
seen
at
it
the
corregidor
looked
sorrowfully
but
appealingly
up
at
him
his
voice
was
a
weak
whisper
yes
we
got
him
it
was
don
panchito
s
red
one
no
the
pullet
no
none
of
the
family
seemed
to
see
me
but
quién
sabe
for
a
considerable
time
more
nothing
happened
i
began
to
wonder
if
this
too
had
been
a
ruse
now
and
then
the
alcalde
or
the
corregidor
rose
and
peered
anxiously
down
the
street
through
the
crack
of
the
door
whenever
the
patter
of
footsteps
sounded
outside
the
pair
grew
stiff
with
misgiving
then
suddenly
in
burst
the
cholo
carrying
under
his
poncho
the
already
relieved
of
its
feathers
thus
accounting
for
the
last
delay
it
was
a
tolerably
plump
bird
and
the
corregidor
thought
fifty
centavos
would
be
a
just
price
he
would
give
it
to
don
panchito
when
his
wrath
had
cooled
i
paid
it
and
hurried
home
there
followed
an
hour
s
wandering
and
pleading
all
of
which
i
must
do
in
person
since
tommy
spoke
no
spanish
and
several
more
appeals
to
the
corregidor
before
i
got
lard
rice
tiny
potatoes
at
ten
cents
a
pound
as
well
as
an
unexpected
bowl
of
what
purported
to
be
stewed
peaches
the
pot
the
corregidor
could
lend
us
was
large
enough
for
an
army
tommy
who
had
once
been
second
cook
on
board
they
had
found
appointed
fireman
and
general
assistant
and
soon
had
the
fagot
out
under
the
back
porch
roaring
then
with
plantains
fried
in
lard
and
but
why
enumerate
by
the
time
we
had
fed
the
ragamuffins
at
the
back
door
and
hung
the
not
yet
empty
kettle
on
the
top
of
a
even
tommy
s
inclination
to
make
tea
had
evaporated
it
may
not
have
been
a
genuine
christmas
dinner
pumpkin
pie
for
instance
was
painfully
conspicuous
by
its
absence
but
it
produced
the
same
effect
while
tommy
stretched
out
on
a
mud
divan
i
spread
my
poncho
on
the
sand
under
a
tree
in
the
back
yard
where
the
gusts
of
breeze
came
often
enough
to
lull
me
quickly
into
a
siesta
i
had
barely
fallen
asleep
when
the
came
to
give
me
information
about
the
town
and
i
must
get
up
and
go
back
to
the
room
with
him
there
he
picked
up
the
scattered
pages
of
ibañez
flor
de
mayo
i
had
discarded
as
i
read
then
clawed
out
my
copy
of
a
cochabamba
newspaper
when
he
had
perused
that
he
took
to
fingering
my
which
fortunately
he
could
not
read
until
at
last
in
disgust
i
spread
my
poncho
again
on
the
brick
floor
and
was
soon
sound
asleep
when
i
woke
again
at
sunset
both
informant
and
information
had
faded
away
i
went
out
on
the
porch
to
write
and
a
neighbor
came
to
pull
the
out
of
my
hands
and
solemnly
read
it
quite
oblivious
in
his
illiteracy
to
the
fact
that
there
was
hardly
a
word
of
spanish
in
it
besides
being
legible
only
to
the
elect
then
he
must
inspect
my
and
learn
all
its
inner
secrets
when
i
recovered
it
and
continued
writing
with
what
ink
was
not
smeared
over
his
person
he
thrust
his
nose
between
the
pages
inquiring
are
you
noting
all
the
inhabitants
of
pampa
grande
ah
only
the
notable
ones
then
alas
no
you
see
i
have

our
impromptu
celebration
of
christmas
eve
in
pampa
grande
in
the
cool
of
evening
the
corregidor
came
again
to
share
his
troubles
with
me
bewailing
the
fact
that
pampa
grande
no
longer
had
a
christmas
celebration
because
they
had
no
cura
by
the
same
token
there
was
no
longer
a
public
market
on
sundays
and
for
the
indians
only
come
to
town
to
sell
if
there
is
a
church
fiesta
at
which
they
can
drink
god
save
us
he
sighed
as
he
rose
to
leave
for
want
of
a
priest
we
are
all
turning
protestants
i
respread
my
bed
early
but
the
aftermath
of
the
christmas
dinner
had
not
yet
run
its
course
some
time
far
into
night
i
was
for
a
long
time
of
some
hubbub
and
at
last
woke
entirely
on
his
piece
of
blanket
on
the
floor
tommy
was
rolling
from
side
to
side
in
one
hand
his
precious
trowel
which
he
was
beating
on
the
flaggings
until
it
rang
again
while
shouting
at
the
top
of
his
voice
mortar
mortar
how
in
can
i
lay
bricks
if
you
don
t
keep
me
in
mortar
all
next
day
he
dragged
far
behind
in
the
miles
to
samaipata
second
largest
town
of
this
leg
of
the
journey
ahead
of
us
was
a
tramp
without
the
suggestion
of
a
village
and
we
were
forced
to
weigh
ourselves
down
under
such
supplies
as
we
could
purchase
some
two
hours
beyond
samaipata
feet
or
more
above
the
road
up
the
range
on
the
right
stands
what
the
natives
of
the
region
call
el
here
in
a
splendid
strategic
position
covering
the
flat
top
of
an
entire
hill
were
and
still
are
extensive
terraces
and
the
mostly
fallen
remains
of
what
must
have
been
important
buildings
now
overgrown
with
brush
though
there
are
few
or
no
real
trees
scattered
about
this
cold
and
barren
plateau
some
feet
above
are
many
carved
seats
similar
to
those
of
cuzco
and
vicinity
and
figures
cut
in
sandstone
among
which
jaguars
ostriches
and
other
fauna
of
the
andes
can
still
be
distinguished
though
many
are
and
beyond
identification
practical
miners
who
have
visited
the
spot
report
the
existence
of
apparatus
of
hewn
stone
according
to
tradition
the
incas
had
here
their
easternmost
stronghold
built
by
yupanqui
the
emperor
who
aspired
to
conquer
the
hated
the
breechless
tribes
of
the
tropical
lowlands
at
present
el
fuerte
is
utterly
uninhabited
for
many
years
one
aged
indian
lived
here
long
reputed
to
be
more
than
a
century
old
the
people
of
the
region
called
him
the
inca
and
credited
him
with
supernatural
powers
and
untold
wealth
the
usual
rumors
of
hidden
gold
and
jewels
and
of
subterranean
passages
from
temple
to
hover
about
the
place
so
far
as
is
known
the
site
has
never
been
visited
or
at
least
explored
by
archeologists
to
whom
it
might
bring
rewards
not
inferior
to
those
of
machu
picchu
as
the
andes
flattened
down
ever
slowly
and
as
if
under
protest
the
population
showed
more
african
blood
and
if
the
people
did
not
grow
more
friendly
at
least
they
were
less
incommunicative
than
those
of
the
highlands
the
women
took
to
smoking
a
custom
almost
unknown
to
the
sex
on
the
until
it
become
quite
the
fashion
quichua
had
finally
died
out
near
totora
real
tropical
heat
such
as
i
had
all
but
forgotten
the
existence
of
weighed
down
upon
us
though
it
did
not
induce
tommy
to
be
seen
without
his
winter
vest
we
moved
forward
steadily
but
no
longer
pushed
the
pace
the
tropics
is
no
place
for
that
wandering
comfortably
along
sandy
trails
through
we
came
now
and
then
upon
a
cluster
of
wooden
crosses
tied
together
with
vines
with
rudely
carved
and
misspelled
lettering
such
as
rogad
adiós
por
el
alma
de
pablo
morales
fallesió
julio
de
the
alcalde
of
monos
which
consisted
of
a
single
hut
at
the
top
of
a
stiff
zigzag
had
already
held
that
honor
for
years
in
spite
of
his
protests
when
i
handed
him
the
order
from
his
chief
in
samaipata
he
returned
it
asking
me
to
read
it
aloud
as
he
could
not
i
did
so
fairly
without
taking
advantage
of
the
occasion
to
include
a
command
from
the
president
of
the
republic
for
him
to
stand
on
his
head
and
duly
impressed
he
spread
a
cowhide
for
us
on
the
unlevelled
earth
floor
of
his
and
set
his
women
to
preparing
us
a
caldo
of
which
we
furnished
the
rice
and
they
the
fire
labor
and
a
bit
of
what
looked
and
tasted
like
grass
food
had
grown
so
tasteless
that
we
had
to
force
it
down
like
medicine
simply
because
we
needed
the
strength
to
me
fell
the
task
of
making
the
family
understand
why
we
should
wish
to
eat
again
in
the
morning
before
we
started
a
couple
of
hours
beyond
i
came
upon
tommy
who
for
once
had
forged
ahead
seated
beside
the
trail
and
overcome
with
sadness
with
reason
as
the
spaniard
says
far
away
across
the
bottomless
wooded
hole
in
the
earth
at
our
feet
rose
a
sharp
range
with
red
rock
cliffs
up
which
the
trail
climbed
to
the
very
gates
of
we
should
find
locked
no
doubt
when
we
arrived
as
tommy
put
it
i
think
they
must
have
to
take
part
of
that
hill
away
when
the
moon
comes
we
slept
that
night
higher
than
samaipata
but
this
was
the
last
surge
of
the
andean
billows
next
morning
we
came
out
on
a
wonderful
vista
of
tropical
south
america
an
unbroken
sea
of
green
rolling
and
more
hilly
than
i
had
imagined
it
spreading
away
in
all
directions
into
the
purple
haze
of
vast
distances
we
had
come
at
last
to
the
end
of
the
andes
now
and
then
thereafter
came
a
short
descent
but
no
more
rises
and
we
were
soon
in
real
jungle
with
of
many
species
banana
plants
appeared
and
insects
bit
us
from
hair
to
ankles
upon
us
came
that
languor
of
the
tropics
and
for
the
first
time
i
realized
the
strain
of
living
and
tramping
two
or
three
miles
aloft
dense
vegetation
crowded
the
trail
now
heavy
in
sand
in
which
the
constant
slap
of
our
feet
grew
monotonous
close
on
either
hand
night
had
no
terrors
now
for
we
could
lie
down
anywhere
fruit
of
many
kinds
grew
bananas
melons
oranges
green
in
color
papayas
was
rarely
for
sale
the
rare
inhabitants
had
a
more
kindly
air
addressing
us
as
ché
hola
ché
gringo
familiar
and
affectionate
term
evidently
from
the
guaraní
for
look
or
listen
which
we
were
to
hear
often
from
now
on
clear
into
the
argentine
but
they
were
still
not
noted
for
unselfishness
a
belligerent
attitude
might
have
won
more
but
that
we
had
left
behind
with
the
bleak
highlands
besides
through
it
all
tommy
would
have
hung
on
my
had
i
worn
one
shuddering
in
his
english
voice
don
t
don
t
tyke
it
the
police
once
anything
had
been
obtained
he
would
have
made
away
with
it
so
swiftly
that
i
should
have
caught
little
more
than
its
vagrant
aroma
the
desire
for
sweets
was
alarming
indeed
it
was
a
craving
for
food
rather
than
hunger
that
troubled
us
we
ate
great
chunks
of
and
an
hour
after
the
best
meal
we
should
have
jumped
to
accept
an
invitation
to
a
dinner
we
were
following
now
the
course
of
the
little
all
but
waterless
piray
some
day
to
join
the
mamoré
and
the
amazon
there
were
many
of
donkeys
and
mules
going
and
coming
thunder
grumbled
frequently
far
off
to
the
east
toward
sunset
we
came
upon
an
before
which
hung
a
bullock
on
a
the
process
of
being
charquied
and
already
as
succulent
as
the
sole
of
an
old
boot
the
haughty
hacendado
grudgingly
sold
us
chunks
of
the
animal
at
the
price
of
fifty
centavos
a
pound
and
steeping
tea
in
water
so
thick
it
could
all
but
stand
alone
we
cut
off
slabs
of
the
meat
and
thrust
them
into
the
fire
on
the
ends
of
sticks
to
eat
it
and
unaccompanied
like
gauchos
of
the
pampas
about
the
house
was
thick
grass
an
unusual
feature
in
south
america
for
ordinarily
either
the
altitude
is
too
great
for
it
or
the
jungle
so
thick
it
can
not
grow
in
the
constant
shade
the
hacendado
gave
us
permission
to
lie
anywhere
in
the
yard
with
a
graciousness
that
implied
we
might
also
eat
the
longest
grass
if
we
chose
all
the
corrals
in
the
neighborhood
were
filled
with
and
with
arrieros
speaking
both
spanish
and
the
quichua
of
the
highlands
on
the
way
to
or
from
santa
cruz
with
cargoes
of
alcohol
hides
and
tobacco
coming
out
and
foreign
merchandise
going
in
for
a
long
time
we
sat
in
the
velvety
air
of
a
jungle
evening
listening
to
the
singing
of
and
crickets
and
the
occasional
faint
tinkle
of
a
grazing
s
bell
with
now
and
then
the
sharp
excited
chorus
of
birds
interwoven
with
the
voices
of
the
arrieros
then
i
picked
a
spot
as
apt
to
be
free
from
snakes
on
the
clipped
grass
a
few
yards
from
the
house
and
lay
down
on
my
rubber
poncho
the
soft
breeze
soon
lulled
me
to
sleep
in
spite
of
the
itching
of
countless
i
had
not
slept
long
probably
when
i
was
awakened
by
rain
striking
me
in
the
face
it
would
not
last
long
i
fancied
i
pulled
the
poncho
over
me
and
let
it
rain
it
did
quickly
it
increased
to
a
hollow
roar
trickles
of
water
began
to
tickle
me
along
the
ribs
evidently
i
had
picked
a
slight
slope
for
the
water
was
soon
pouring
in
upon
me
in
streams
i
caught
up
my
scattered
belongings
and
dashed
for
the
house
the
wet
poncho
lapping
up
all
the
mud
in
the
vicinity
and
some
of
my
effects
dropping
at
each
step
forcing
me
to
await
the
next
flash
of
lightning
to
find
them
under
the
corredor
roof
there
was
barely
room
to
roll
up
beside
tommy
on
the
earth
floor
trampled
hard
as
an
iron
casting
and
for
an
hour
there
roared
such
a
tropical
deluge
as
i
had
never
known
in
the
western
hemisphere
the
piray
now
a
wide
raging
river
of
red
mud
forced
us
to
strip
to
the
waist
and
even
then
splashed
us
redly
far
higher
as
we
breasted
the
powerful
current
all
day
we
plowed
through
dense
forest
wet
and
soggy
singing
with
insect
life
a
roaring
tropical
shower
bursting
upon
us
now
and
then
after
each
of
which
the
red
sun
blazed
out
through
the
thick
humid
air
with
dusk
we
waded
into
la
guardia
sticky
and
sweated
as
the
dweller
in
the
tropics
must
always
be
who
can
not
spend
the
day
in
a
hammock
fighting
swarms
of
gnats
while
we
waited
patiently
for
the
promised
antidote
for
our
raging
appetites
twice
during
the
day
we
had
climbed
padlocked
bars
across
the
trail
i
had
fancied
them
but
found
they
were
little
for
the
collection
of
duty
on
goods
entering
or
produce
leaving
the
department
of
santa
cruz
each
hide
exported
paid
about
cents
the
flour
that
had
come
all
the
way
from
tacoma
washington
by
ship
train
and
mule
had
added
to
its
already
exorbitant
price
a
high
departmental
duty
no
wonder
chunks
of
boiled
yuca
commonly
took
the
place
of
bread
beyond
la
guardia
the
country
was
more
open
the
forest
at
times
giving
place
to
with
single
trees
and
grazing
cattle
across
which
drifted
a
breeze
that
tempered
the
midsummer
heat
the
way
lay
so
straight
across
the
country
that
the
line
of
telegraph
poles
beside
it
looked
like
a
single
pole
standing
forth
against
the
horizon
there
were
many
huts
now
roofed
and
sometimes
entirely
made
of
palm
branches
warm
muddy
water
was
our
only
drink
for
we
had
descended
so
low
that
the
inhabitants
were
too
lazy
even
to
make
chicha
once
we
got
a
watermelon
which
are
small
here
and
far
from
being
on
ice
in
passing
another
hut
i
was
startled
by
a
cry
of
se
vende
pan
and
went
in
to
pay
two
females
whose
faces
were
a
patchwork
of
an
astounding
price
for
some
tiny
soggy
biscuits
ponderous
with
solid
wooden
wheels
crawled
by
noiselessly
in
the
deep
sand
behind
three
and
even
four
pairs
of
drowsy
oxen
everything
even
the
breeze
moved
now
with
the
leisureliness
of
the
tropics
the
jungle
ahead
was
so
flat
and
green
so
banked
by
clouds
that
one
had
the
feeling
that
the
sea
was
soon
to
open
out
beyond
we
loafed
languidly
on
certain
that
our
goal
was
near
yet
though
there
were
other
evidences
that
we
were
approaching
a
city
there
were
no
more
visible
signs
of
it
than
in
approaching
port
saïd
from
the
sea
at
last
so
gradually
that
we
were
some
time
in
distinguishing
it
from
a

in

with
the

we
drifted
inertly
into
a
silent
tropical
city
street
past
rows
of
languid
stares
and
on
the
last
afternoon
of
the
year
with
cochabamba
miles
behind
us
sat
down
dripping
a
week
s
lack
of
shave
veiling
our
features
in
the
central
plaza
of
santa
cruz
de
la
sierra
tommy
had
heard
so
many
stories
of
the
generosity
of
the
cruceños
that
he
was
astonished
to
have
reached
the
center
of
town
without
being
invited
from
some
doorway
to
come
in
and
make
his
home
there
as
long
as
he
chose
this
was
doubly
annoying
since
rumor
had
it
that
white
men
were
so
in
favor
with
the
gentler
sex
that
a
one
as
handsome
as
tommy
fancied
himself
to
be
was
in
danger
of
being
damaged
by
the
feminine
rush
his
appearance
was
sure
to
precipitate
after
a
time
he
rose
to
carry
his
perplexity
back
to
where
we
had
seen
the
british
shield
covering
the
front
of
a
house
when
i
met
him
again
he
had
told
his
sad
tale
so
effectively
that
he
had
been
put
up
at
both
hotels
by
as
many
compatriots
and
was
eating
regularly
at
each
though
taking
care
not
to
let
his
right
hand
know
what
the
left
was
carrying
to
his
mouth
after
dark
in
a
humid
night
made
barely
visible
by
a
few
candle
i
splashed
out
to
the
hut
of
manuel
abasto
in
the
outskirts
to
sleep
under
the
trees
in
the
hammock
of
one
of
the
american
prospectors
the
legitimate
occupant
being
engaged
in
the
rôle
of
don
juan
in
the
city
the
hut
was
crowded
with
peons
already
half
drunk
languidly
fingering
several
guitars
and
now
and
then
raising
mournful
voices
in
some
amorous
ballad
at
midnight
rang
and
one
distant
whistle
blew
weakly
to
greet
the
incoming
year
but
the
music
of
the
tropical
rain
on
the
canvas
over
my
head
soon
lulled
me
to
sleep
again

capital
of

the

owes
its
fame
largely
to
its
isolation
like

corners
of

it
is

only
because
of

almost
an

to

those

common
also
to

loss
of
health
but
his
energetic
view
of
life
which
the
caucasian
immigrant
risks
especially
during
this
hottest
season
of
january
the
heat
was
humid
and
heavy
and
i
found
myself
falling
quickly
into
the
local
mood
of
contentment
just
to
lie
in
a
hammock
and
let
the
world
drift
on
without
me
it
took
an
unusual
length
of
time
to
make
up
my
mind
to
do
anything
and
then
required
more
than
usual
to
force
myself
to
get
up
and
do
it
particularly
to
keep
on
doing
it
until
it
was
finished
but
it
is
perhaps
as
largely
due
to
environment
as
to
the
climate
that
santa
cruz
is
visibly
lazy
the
region
roundabout
is
so
fertile
that
almost
every
staple
except
wheat
and
potatoes
grow
and
the
slightest
exertion
earns
sustenance
there
are
sugar
plantations
and
and
establishments
scattered
here
and
there
the
province
of
sara
to
the
north
supplies
food
not
only
to
the
city
but
to
the
rubber
districts
as
far
away
as
the
acre
coffee
rice
and
tobacco
can
be
produced
in
abundance
hides
already
constitute
an
important
export
the
region
to
the
west
is
reputed
rich
in
oil
yet
santa
cruz
makes
small
use
of
her
possibilities
languidly
waiting
for
the
arrival
of
a
railroad
and
the
influx
of
foreign
capital
to
develop
them
the
rumors
that
seep
up
out
of
santa
cruz
of
her
beautiful
types
are
largely
of
artificial
propagation
it
is
true
that
she
has
a
larger
percentage
of
spanish
blood
than
any
other
city
of
bolivia
but
this
is
rarely
found
in
its
unadulterated
form
some
negro
and
considerable
indian
ancestry
has
left
its
mark
and
while
there
is
not
a
african
or
perhaps
a
full
indian
in
town
and
spanish
is
the
universal
if
slovenly
tongue
genuine
white
natives
are
few
in
number
as
to
the
beautiful
girls
and
women
of
popular
fancy
they
do
exist
but
certainly
in
no
larger
proportion
than
pearls
in
oysters
the
overwhelming
majority
are
with
heavy
noses
and
sensual
lips
crumbling
teeth
that
hint
at
degeneration
and
little
attractiveness
beyond
the
physical
one
of
youth
some
cynic
has
said
that
a
wall
set
about
santa
cruz
de
la
sierra
would
enclose
the
largest
house
of
on
earth
so
broad
a
statement
is
unkind
yet
not
merely
are
the
majority
of
cruceños
born
out
of
much
can
be
said
of
all
those
who
are
accustomed
to
investigate
such
matters
agree
that
the
seeker
after
feminine
favors
in
santa
cruz
need
never
leave
the
block
in
which
he
chances
to
find
himself
foreign
residents
put
it
baldly
that
virginity
never
survives
the
twelfth
year
but
this
is
no
doubt
an
exaggeration
the
causes
of
this
lack
of
social
tautness
are
several
the
overstock
of
one
sex
due
largely
to
the
migration
of
the
young
men
to
the
rubber
forests
of
the
beni
often
never
to
return
a
widespread
poverty
and
the
lack
of
any
independent
means
of
livelihood
for
women
and
a
tropical
apathy
even
of
character
are
perhaps
the
chief
then
too
there
is
a
marked
absence
of
good
example
the
higher
officials
and
more
wealthy
men
have
with
rare
exceptions
at
least
one
irregular
household
not
a
few
have
only
irregular
ones
the
story
is
current
of
one
of
the
chief
political
powers
of
the
department
who
decided
to
visit
his
daughter
at
school
in
germany
forewarned
that
startled
young
lady
hastened
to
write
if
you
and
mama
are
coming
to
germany
you
must
get
married
the
father
yielded
to
this
quaint
whim
of
a
favorite
daughter
and
during
the
weeks
before
his
departure
spread
the
story
far
and
wide
as
one
of
his
best
witticisms
the
native
priests
almost
invariably
have
concubines
some
using
the
transparent
subterfuge
common
to
all
refer
to
their
families
as
housekeeper
and
not
a
few
frankly
speak
of
the
mother
of
my
with
rare
exceptions
this
runs
to
the
plural
among
the
masses
naturally
these
conditions
are
not
improved
upon
marriage
troublesome
expensive
and
conspicuous
hardly
bringing
even
the
advantage
of
neighborly
approbation
is
apt
to
be
looked
upon
as
a
nuisance
and
it
is
always
hard
to
go
to
useless
trouble
in
the
tropics
the
son
of
an
american
resident
was
pointed
out
by
both
sexes
as
a
curiosity
because
he
was
still
without
natural
children
the
laws
of
bolivia
recognize
three
classes
of
offspring
natural
and
unnatural
the
second
are
inalienable
heirs
to
one
fifth
the
father
s
property
the
third
division
comprises
those
born
out
of
wedlock
to
parents
who
could
not
marry
if
they
wished
is
one
or
both
of
whom
is
already
married
or
has
taken
the
priestly
vows
of
celibacy
the
town
has
little
notion
of
the
viewpoint
of
the
rest
of
the
world
on
this
subject
like
an
island
far
out
at
sea
all
but
cut
off
from
the
rest
of
mankind
it
has
developed
a
lack
of
its
own
its
individual
point
of
view
and
like
all
isolated
groups
it
is
sure
of
its
own
importance
in
exact
ratio
to
the
lack
of
outside
influence
so
that
barefooted
cruceños
are
firmly
convinced
that
their
ways
are
vastly
superior
to
those
of
the
rest
of
the
world
which
they
judge
by
the
few
sorry
specimens
thereof
who
drift
in
upon
them
bedraggled
by
weeks
on
wilderness
trails
the
term
colla
used
to
designate
the
people
of
the
bolivian
highlands
and
passed
on
by
the
masses
to
the
world
at
large
is
here
a
word
of
deprecation
with
few
exceptions
the
foreign
residents
soon
fall
into
this
easy
tropical
way
of
life
the
two
belgian
firms
bring
in
scores
of
young
german
employees
trained
in
the
european
main
house
and
there
are
normally
some
teutonic
residents
the
percentage
of
these
is
low
who
are
not
established
within
a
month
of
their
arrival
in
any
part
of
the
region
with
their
own
the
recruit
is
shown
the
expediency
of
this
arrangement
by
both
the
precept
and
the
example
of
his
celibacy
is
alleged
to
be
doubly
baneful
in
the
tropics
there
are
no
hotels
or
restaurants
worthy
the
name
the
pleasure
of
forming
a
part
of
the
best
native
family
would
soon
wear
threadbare
even
if
the
moorish
seclusion
of
these
did
not
make
admittance
impossible
to
live
with
even
a
modicum
of
comfort
in
these
wilds
the
white
man
must
have
a
home
of
his
own
the
frail
walls
thereof
are
slight
protection
against
theft
unless
he
will
reduce
his
possessions
to
what
he
can
carry
to
and
from
his
stool
or
counter
each
day
a
housekeeper
is
imperative
though
a
neighbor
might
be
induced
to
provide
meals
and
such
housekeeping
as
she
has
time
for
the
cruceña
brings
her
personal
interest
to
bear
only
on
those
things
of
which
she
is
genuinely
if
temporarily
a
part
to
her
wages
are
neither
customary
nor
attractive
the
reward
for
her
labors
must
be
a
temporarily
permanent
home
hence
the
servant
problem
is
most
easily
solved
by
adopting
the
servant
whatever
principles
contrary
to
this
mode
of
life
the
youthful
teuton
brings
with
him
from
his
native
land
they
quickly
melt
away
under
the
tropical
sun
and
there
is
commonly
little
resistance
to
the
new
environment
let
it
not
be
understood
that
there
is
unusual
betrayal
or
persecution
of
innocent
womanhood
in
santa
cruz
rather
the
contrary
is
true
it
is
the
man
who
runs
the
most
constant
gauntlet
of
temptation
the
arrival
of
a
new
clerk
is
sure
to
cause
a
crowding
of
young
women
about
the
door
of
the
establishment
and
to
swamp
it
with
pretended
purchasers
report
has
it
that
a
daughter
of
almost
the
best
families
may
be
won
by
the
employee
who
will
remain
a
few
years
and
buy
her
a
house
or
leave
her
a
small
income
at
his
departure
with
the
poorer
classes
the
usual
procedure
is
to
open
negotiations
with
the
girl
s
family
to
give
her
mother
a
present
or
win
her
consent
through
her
taste
for
strong
drink
in
the
wilder
regions
of
the
interior
the
gift
of
a
rifle
or
something
equally
coveted
to
the
father
is
usually
sufficient
daughters
are
easily
acquired
but
rifles
are
scarce
coming
under
short
contract
the
recruit
grown
to
a
bookkeeper
or
goes
his
way
or
is
transferred
and
leaves
behind
whatever
family
may
have
befallen
him
frequently
recommending
his
widow
to
a
newly
arrived
compatriot
though
there
is
said
to
be
less
taking
of
housekeepers
than
formerly
in
a
given
group
of
thirty
germans
twenty
had
female
companions
six
had
german
wives
and
four
legal
cruceña
wives
at
the
time
of
my
stay
in
santa
cruz
native
women
were
calling
monthly
upon
the
cashier
of
a
single
commercial
house
for
the
pension
granted
them
for
the
rearing
of
their
from
one
to
six
children
and
these
were
the
abandoned
mates
only
of
such
as
were
still
employees
of
the
firm
elsewhere
or
of
the
rare
few
who
had
themselves
left
some
stipend
for
their
offspring
the
point
of
view
of
the
teuton
on
this
subject
is
that
he
is
no
worse
but
merely
more
free
from
hypocrisy
than
the
even
the
german
women
accept
the
condition
with
little
protest
often
joining
in
the
celebration
at
the
baptism
of
the
illegitimate
infant
of
a
compatriot
in
an
isolated
corner
of
the
department
i
found
a
likable
german
keeping
house
with
a
negro
girl
and
not
only
was
his
wife
in
germany
aware
of
the
arrangement
and
amused
by
his
letters
concerning
his
companion
but
advised
him
to
keep
her
as
long
as
he
remained
in
bolivia
that
he
might
have
some
one
to
look
after
him
and
keep
him
in
were
the
results
of
these
attachments
an
improved
human
stock
there
might
be
less
to
condemn
for
in
its
present
stage
of
progress
tropical
bolivia
is
more
amenable
to
economic
than
to
moral
improvement
and
the
country
is
sorely
in
need
of
population
but
the
foreign
blood
injected
into
cruceño
arteries
is
as
nothing
against
the
environment
the
sons
of
europeans
may
be
an
improvement
upon
the
natives
at
least
in
those
rare
cases
where
the
father
has
remained
to
add
the
vigor
of
his
training
but
the
succeeding
generation
is
only
too
apt
to
degenerate
quickly
into
the
most
native
of
natives
the
assertion
of
scientists
that
new
blood
must
constantly
be
brought
to
the
tropics
if
these
regions
are
to
progress
is
plainly
demonstrated
in
santa
cruz
throughout
the
department
may
be
seen
in
the
flesh
those
conditions
which
centuries
ago
followed
the
coming
of
the
conquistadores
without
their
own
women
or
the
puritan
s
point
of
view
which
have
made
from
end
to
end
the
abode
of
a
chiefly
mongrel
race
attempted
improvement
of
the
status
quo
meets
with
as
little
approval
as
in
all
other
centers
of
the
universe
the
american
directress
of
the
government
girls
school
found
herself
balked
at
the
outset
in
the
simplest
matters
her
edict
that
pupils
must
not
come
to
school
without
some
other
nether
garment
than
the
customary
skirt
was
bitterly
opposed
both
by
mothers
and
by
her
assistants
on
the
ground
that
it
is
so
hot
in
santa
cruceños
blame
the
heat
for
most
of
their
shortcomings
as
the
gringo
miners
of
the
andes
sweepingly
lay
it
to
the
in
the
school
in
question
there
were
girls
of
the
best
families
of
santa
cruz
one
in
every
four
of
them
was
of
legitimate
birth
the
teachers
were
in
many
cases
decrepit
yet
no
one
with
a
relative
or
a
friend
in
the
government
offices
could
be
removed
because
these
saw
to
it
that
no
report
against
their
protegees
ever
reached
higher
officials
in
the
faculty
meetings
it
was
impossible
to
criticize
a
pupil
whatever
her
delinquency
for
she
was
sure
to
have
at
least
one
relative
among
the
teachers
to
precipitate
an
uproar
on
new
year
s
day
i
had
taken
up
my
abode
with
the
only
permanent
american
resident
of
santa
cruz
juan
bowles
born
in
cavalry
troop
of
which
state
he
had
commanded
from
atlanta
to
the
come
to
brazil
nine
years
after
the
war
and
ascended
to
santa
cruz
by
way
of
the
amazon
in
the
years
when
days
of
hard
labor
were
required
to
cover
the
miles
now
served
by
the
railroad
he
had
never
since
seen
his
native
land
his
was
for
many
years
the
only
producer
of
that
exotic
commodity
in
tropical
bolivia
where
in
the
early
days
it
ranked
as
a
luxury
at
cents
a
pound
under
his
unwilted
american
energy
and
indifference
to
local
caste
rules
the
plant
still
produced
its
daily
quota
if
at
something
less
than
that
regal
reward
on
his
back
veranda
stood
a
leather
stretched
on
a
wooden
frame
on
the
place
to
spend
a
cruceño
night
and
his
stories
of
johnny
rebs
alone
made
the
week
i
spent
there
well
worth
while
sometimes
though
with
difficulty
his
reminiscences
could
be
staged
in
bolivia
after
santa
cruz
had
drunk
and
died
of
swamp
water
savored
with
dead
cats
for
some
three
centuries
this
energetic
new
resident
imported
machinery
and
drove
an
artesian
well
coming
upon
excellent
water
some
fifty
feet
below
the
surface
this
he
offered
for
sale
putting
out
of
business
the
friars
who
watching
the
barometer
successfully
prayed
to
the
virgin
for
rain
the
first
woman
to
arrive
with
her
on
her
head
asked
the
son
in
charge
if
he
were
not
ashamed
to
sell
the
water
god
but
he
didn
t
give
the
pump
or
drive
the
well
retorted
the
boy
there
is
plenty
of
god
s
free
water
over
there
in
the
the
former
captain
of
cavalry
has
ten
wells
to
his
credit
and
is
trying
to
get
the
municipality
to
let
him
install
an
for
all
his
long
residence
the
ohioan
had
by
no
means
reconciled
life
to
the
cruceño
point
of
view
his
criticisms
on
this
subject
were
biting
though
the
town
swarmed
with
educated
loafers
according
to
their
ideals
it
was
all
but
impossible
to
get
native
assistants
the
youths
egged
on
by
their
mothers
flocked
to
the
already
overcrowded
professions
rather
than
become
mechanics
or
learn
to
run
an
engine
two
occupations
sadly
needed
in
santa
cruz
as
the
old
man
put
it
they
won
t
come
here
and
learn
a
good
useful
trade
with
pay
while
learning
yet
if
you
throw
a
stone
at
a
dog
anywhere
in
town
and
miss
him
you
are
sure
to
hit
a
priest
a
lawyer
or
a
nothing
to
the
boys
he
could
hire
of
the
most
families
would
not
work
where
anyone
could
see
them
agapito
would
tote
bricks
within
the
patio
without
a
protest
but
he
would
take
his
discharge
rather
than
carry
a
parcel
to
or
from
the
the
mothers
would
rather
have
their
daughters
earn
their
living
in
the
local
feminine
way
than
have
their
sons
descend
to
manual
labor
a
caballero
wearing
shoes
without
socks
requiring
his
gun
repaired
to
go
hunting
could
not
get
it
to
the
shop
until
he
could
find
an
indian
to
carry
it
there
bowles
was
an
interesting
example
of
the
transplanted
american
a
man
of
education
and
of
shrewd
native
wit
he
had
developed
here
in
the
wilderness
a
quaint
isolated
philosophy
of
his
own
and
was
one
of
those
rare
white
men
who
have
spent
many
years
unbrokenly
in
such
an
environment
and
climate
without
going
to
not
merely
was
he
a
wide
and
reflective
reader
on
all
subjects
from
the
scientific
to
the
curious
but
still
at
produced
in
the
interstices
of
his
labors
as
chief
mechanic
of
the
region
authoritative
articles
for
the
buenos
aires
london
and
american
periodicals
how
great
a
feat
this
is
only
those
can
understand
who
know
the
enervating
effect
on
both
mind
and
body
of
long
tropical
residence
his
staunch
individualism
and
independence
of
the
verdict
of
the
world
was
little
short
of
startling
to
those
of
us
who
live
more
nearly
in
it
set
away
in
the
fastnesses
of
the
earth
with
only
his
own
mind
to
feed
upon
instead
of
having
his
opinions
delivered
at
his
door
each
morning
by
the
newsboy
he
had
developed
a
of
his
own
that
grasped
firmly
whatever
it
took
hold
of
and
a
hard
unsentimental
common
sense
fitted
to
his
environment
his
speech
carried
one
back
to
the
civil
war
and
his
vocabulary
had
quaint
amusing
touches
for
the
words
he
had
added
to
it
since
his
migration
had
been
chiefly
from
books
with
rare
and
brief
intercourse
with
persons
thus
his
pronunciation
of
many
terms
unknown
to
the
world
in
the
seventies
had
been
evolved
from
his
own
mind
amid
his
environment
he
spoke
of
alumeénum
and
called
the
recently
discovered
cause
of
all
earthly
ills
words
like
poligamic
rarely
heard
from
any
but
scientific
mouths
appeared
in
the
same
sentence
with
ketched
the
past
participle
of
civil
war
days
edison
s
noisy
invention
he
called
but
the
word
leisurely
he
pronounced
correctly
not
a
common
american
feat
this
new
year
s
day
was
notable
to
bowles
for
another
reason
his
youngest
son
and
last
effective
assistant
made
his
first
appearance
in
the
uniform
of
a
bolivian
soldier
and
moved
from
home
to
the
cuartel
conscription
is
theoretically
universal
in
bolivia
on
the
first
day
of
each
year
every
youth
within
the
republic
who
has
reached
his
nineteenth
birthday
must
report
at
the
capital
of
his
department
ready
for
service
those
that
are
not
physically
unfit
or
have
not
sufficient
influence
are
given
three
months
training
after
which
they
draw
lots
to
serve
two
years
at
centavos
a
day
during
my
time
there
the
plaza
of
santa
cruz
was
overrun
with
lank
country
boys
and
sallow
city
youths
in
most
cases
still
in
their
civilian
garb
of
baggy
linen
or
attire
awkwardly
practicing
the
right
and
left
face
under
the
commands
of
youthful
officers
by
bolivian
law
a
child
born
in
bolivia
is
a
bolivian
whatever
the
nationality
of
the
father
the
civil
war
veteran
who
had
strictly
kept
his
american
citizenship
though
married
to
a
bolivian
wife
had
appealed
in
vain
to
the
american
minister
in
la
paz
prospective
immigrants
to
this
as
to
several
other
south
american
countries
should
not
overlook
this
point
in
the
future
of
their
children
as
bowles
expressed
it
fifteen
hundred
bolivianos
for
every
son
born
in
the
country
is
too
much
tax
to
pay
for
the
privilege
of
living
in
when
the
time
came
for
choosing
by
lot
the
recruits
needed
to
make
up
the
peace
quota
of
the
bolivian
army
teutonic
in
its
discipline
and
formation
this
useful
son
of
an
american
drew
unlucky
and
was
obliged
to
serve
two
years
though
fate
had
left
behind
in
santa
cruz
many
a
worthless
native
loafer
but
the
then
most
gringo
sojourner
in
santa
cruz
was
an
englishman
who
chose
to
call
himself
jack
his
habitat
was
the
departmental
prison
his
story
was
to
the
penny
dreadful
or
the
cinema
screen
some
years
ago
thompson
and
a
had
drifted
out
of
the
interior
of
brazil
into
corumbá
and
offered
to
sell
their
rights
to
a
rubber
forest
they
had
discovered
the
teutonic
house
that
showed
interest
asked
them
to
await
a
decision
and
meanwhile
offered
them
employment
in
the
escort
of
a
party
of
german
employees
peons
and
muleteers
carrying
in
gold
to
a
branch
of
the
establishment
in
the
interior
of
bolivia
on
the
trail
a
german
of
the
escort
drew
the
englishmen
into
a
plot
to
hold
up
the
party
a
week
or
more
inland
at
a
rivulet
called
ypias
the
trio
suddenly
fell
upon
their
companions
and
killed
three
germans
a
frenchman
a
bolivian
muleteer
and
the
chola
housekeeper
of
the
chief
of
the
expedition
the
rest
scattered
into
the
jungle
except
one
old
indian
arriero
who
unable
to
run
managed
to
crawl
up
into
the
branches
of
a
nearby
tree
there
he
witnessed
the
second
act
of
the
melodrama
for
a
time
the
trio
remained
in
peace
and
concord
washed
drank
and
concocted
a
meal
over
jungle
brush
but
soon
the
question
of
the
division
of
the
gold
became
a
dispute
the
german
asserted
that
as
author
of
the
plan
he
should
take
half
the
englishmen
insisted
on
an
equal
division
the
dispute
became
a
quarrel
at
length
late
in
the
afternoon
when
the
unknown
observer
was
ready
to
drop
to
the
ground
and
a
quick
death
from
exhaustion
fear
and
thirst
the
englishmen
fell
upon
their
confederate
with
a
revolver
two
rifles
and
a
sabre
even
a
german
must
succumb
under
such
odds
leaving
the
body
where
it
fell
the
pair
divided
the
gold
and
each
swinging
a
pair
of
saddlebags
over
a
shoulder
struck
off
into
the
trackless
jungle
for
some
reason
fancying
this
a
surer
escape
than
to
mount
mules
and
dash
for
safety

often
catches
a
glimpse
of
the
patio
a
garden
gay
with
flowers
meanwhile
some
of
the
refugees
had
reached
nearby
settlements
several
search
parties
were
made
up
and
having
buried
what
the
vultures
had
left
took
up
the
scent
the
natives
of
these
jungle
regions
are
not
easily
eluded
in
their
own
element
for
four
days
the
britons
struggled
through
the
tropical
wilderness
from
it
was
september
at
the
end
of
the
dry
soon
reduced
to
a
few
native
berries
as
food
the
gold
became
too
heavy
for
their
waning
forces
they
managed
to
climb
to
the
summit
of
a
jungle
bluff
and
bury
most
of
it
on
the
fifth
day
a
search
party
came
upon
them
resting
in
a
shaded
thicket
a
volley
killed
his
companion
and
slightly
wounded
leaving
the
corpse
for
the
vultures
the
pursuers
tracked
the
wounded
man
all
night
and
next
morning
caught
him
at
bay
having
pointed
out
the
of
the
gold
he
was
set
backward
astride
a
mule
with
his
hands
tied
behind
him
and
amid
such
persecution
as
the
savage
bolivian
can
invent
was
escorted
to
san
josé
and
later
driven
through
the
jungle
and
lodged
in
the
departmental
prison
all
this
had
occurred
three
years
before
twice
thompson
who
was
a
mason
as
are
some
of
the
officials
of
bolivia
the
first
time
he
was
found
drunk
in
the
plaza
before
his
evasion
was
known
the
second
he
walked
the
leagues
to
yacuiva
through
the
jungle
without
once
touching
the
trail
only
to
celebrate
too
early
what
he
fancied
for
lack
of
geographical
knowledge
was
his
escape
into
the
argentine
and
be
forced
to
walk
all
the
way
back
finally
after
more
than
a
year
in
prison
he
had
been
paper
as
in
all
within
another
had
coaxed
the
judge
to
deliver
his
verdict
and
sentence
be
shot
the
supreme
court
and
the
president
had
still
to
pass
upon
the
matter
and
another
year
had
drifted
by
of
late
years
it
is
not
easy
to
gain
admittance
to
the
prison
of
santa
cruz
about
its
doors
swarm
ragged
sentinels
who
scream
frantically
cabo
de
guardia
corporal
of
the
guard
and
swing
their
aged
muskets
menacingly
whenever
a
stranger
pauses
to
speak
to
them
but
a
note
from
the
prefect
brought
me
the
attention
of
the
haughty
superiors
of
the
policía
de
seguridad
who
saw
fit
to
permit
me
to
wade
across
the
first
patio
of
the
prison
there
an
insolent
in
the
remnants
of
a
faded
khaki
uniform
felt
me
carefully
over
for
firearms
and
at
length
deigned
to
open
a
door
beyond
another
anteroom
and
through
another
wooden
gate
i
found
myself
in
a
bare
patio
some
forty
feet
square
with
a
deep
open
well
and
signs
that
the
entire
yard
became
a
pond
whenever
it
rained
this
was
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
an
ancient
low
building
of
adobe
under
the
projecting
eaves
of
which
on
the
ground
or
in
hammocks
and
inside
squalid
rooms
loafed
a
score
or
more
of
men
and
several
women
of
all
known
human
complexions
and
degrees
of
undress
a
single
boy
soldier
of
simian
brow
with
a
disproportionately
heavy
loaded
rifle
on
his
shoulder
paraded
in
the
shade
of
the
eaves
he
looked
indeed
like
one
to
whose
ingrown
intelligence
could
safely
be
trusted
matters
of
life
and
death
my
errand
made
known
several
of
the
prisoners
without
rising
began
to
shout
don
arturo
by
and
by
a
voice
came
back
stá
bañandose
i
crossed
to
one
of
the
cells
a
small
room
filled
with
sundry
junk
chiefly
the
tools
of
a
mechanic
of
which
the
door
stood
ajar
inside
on
a
piece
of
board
laid
on
the
earth
floor
stood
thompson
in
the
costume
of
adam
pouring
a
bucket
of
water
over
his
head
i
explained
that
i
was
drifting
through
bolivia
and
fancied
he
might
be
glad
to
hear
his
native
tongue
again
he
was
having
had
only
two
such
visitors
during
the
year
just
ended
wrapping
a
towel
about
his
loins
he
stood
and
chatted
while
an
anemic
in
what
had
once
been
khaki
leaned
against
the
watching
our
every
movement
and
several
other
prisoners
crowded
round
in
the
customary
south
american
fashion
thompson
was
an
unattractive
man
in
middle
life
rather
thin
with
the
accent
and
bad
teeth
of
the
englishman
of
the
mechanic
class
and
the
uninspired
and
rather
hopeless
philosophy
of
life
common
to
that
caste
otherwise
his
attitude
was
in
no
way
different
from
what
it
would
have
been
had
we
been
a
pair
of
tramps
met
on
the
road
he
smiled
frequently
as
he
talked
and
was
neither
more
sad
nor
more
cynical
than
the
average
of
his
class
he
made
no
secret
of
his
part
in
what
he
referred
to
as
our
stunt
and
gave
me
detailed
information
on
how
to
find
the
graves
along
the
trail
where
we
pulled
it
off
in
case
i
should
continue
to
the
eastward
he
plainly
regretted
the
crime
but
only
because
he
had
been
caught
knowing
he
had
already
published
a
doctored
account
of
the
occurrence
in
an
english
monthly
and
had
found
the
remuneration
exceedingly
useful
in
eking
out
his
existence
in
a
bolivian
prison
i
suggested
the
writing
of
the
whole
story
aye
but
they
re
not
going
to
give
me
time
he
answered
rolling
and
lighting
a
cigarette
i
just
got
word
from
sucre
that
they
have
confirmed
the
sentence
now
as
soon
as
the
president
signs
it
they
ll
call
me
out
and
oh
i
don
t
believe
montes
would
do
that
to
a
gringo
i
remarked
encouragingly
he
is
a
mason
well
i
don
t
care
a
rap
whether
they
do
or
not
he
replied
with
considerable
heat
i
m
perfectly
willing
they
do
it
and
have
it
over
with
even
if
he
commutes
the
sentence
it
means
ten
years
more
of
this
pointed
to
the
slovenly
yard
and
dirtier
and
it
s
quite
as
bad
as
the
other
i
don
t
know
but
when
he
had
dressed
and
stepped
outside
to
pose
for
a
photograph
he
presented
rather
a
natty
appearance
though
his
face
could
not
be
disguised
together
we
wandered
through
the
prison
thompson
in
his
striving
to
be
simpático
amid
his
surroundings
had
become
quite
a
caballero
in
his
manner
and
spoke
spanish
unusually
well
for
one
of
his
class
and
nationality
the
prisoners
found
it
as
necessary
to
earn
their
own
living
inside
the
prison
as
outside
for
though
the
government
theoretically
furnishes
food
it
would
not
have
kept
the
smallest
inmate
alive
for
a
week
thompson
asserted
that
he
had
not
touched
prison
fare
since
his
incarceration
his
cell
was
fitted
up
as
a
workshop
with
a
bench
a
small
vise
and
such
tools
of
a
mechanic
as
he
had
been
able
to
collect
and
he
earned
a
meager
fare
and
other
necessities
by
mending
watches
and
at
the
various
tinkering
jobs
that
reached
him
from
outside
was
the
favorite
occupation
of
his
more
than
a
dozen
had
their
open
cells
scattered
with
odds
and
ends
of
leather
and
footwear
formerly
the
public
had
passed
freely
in
and
out
of
the
prison
and
prisoners
underbidding
free
labor
since
their
lodging
was
already
supplied
them
had
always
earned
enough
to
satisfy
their
appetites
now
the
rules
had
become
somewhat
more
strict
at
least
to
outsiders
and
with
less
opportunity
to
sell
their
wares
more
than
one
inmate
suffered
from
hunger
we
passed
into
one
of
the
two
large
common
rooms
mud
dens
in
which
thompson
had
seen
as
many
as
persons
of
both
sexes
and
all
degrees
of
crime
age
and
condition
sometimes
for
an
entire
month
by
some
whim
of
or
judge
the
room
being
completely
innocent
of
any
convenience
whatever
the
conditions
of
prisoners
and
prison
when
the
door
might
finally
be
unlocked
needs
no
description
just
now
the
room
was
open
and
there
were
but
inmates
men
and
women
mixed
indiscriminately
for
there
were
no
rules
even
at
night
as
to
the
of
the
two
sexes
the
female
prisoners
in
fact
earned
their
food
as
do
so
many
cruceñas
outside
from
such
of
the
male
inmates
and
soldier
guards
as
could
reward
their
favors
and
had
advanced
to
a
point
where
even
privacy
was
no
longer
requisite
even
then
several
slovenly
couples
reclined
together
on
the
uneven
floor
in
attitudes
and
on
a
species
of
crippled
bed
in
a
corner
sat
an
fellow
of
some
negro
blood
on
the
floor
at
whose
feet
her
uncurried
head
resting
affectionately
between
his
legs
squatted
a
native
woman
in
the
early
thirties
who
might
years
before
have
been
almost
beautiful
she
had
killed
the
turk
with
whom
she
had
been
living
and
was
for
a
time
under
sentence
to
be
shot
the
president
however
after
making
her
two
accomplices
draw
lots
for
fifteen
years
imprisonment
and
execution
bolivian
law
two
persons
can
not
be
executed
for
the
same
supreme
penalty
falling
upon
a
chilian
had
commuted
her
sentence
to
ten
years
outside
the
prison
the
rumor
was
prevalent
that
her
lenient
treatment
arose
from
the
fact
that
she
had
borne
a
son
to
the
prosecuting
attorney
during
my
stroll
my
companion
ceremoniously
introduced
me
to
several
of
the
six
gringo
prisoners
one
was
a
eight
months
before
the
manager
of
a
local
bank
and
since
then
in
prison
still
untried
on
the
charge
of
disposing
of
bad
drafts
when
a
powerful
company
does
not
feel
it
has
sufficient
evidence
to
convict
a
man
whose
arrest
it
has
caused
it
is
the
bolivian
custom
to
see
that
the
judge
does
not
bring
the
case
to
trial
nearly
every
government
official
having
his
price
the
prisons
are
apt
to
hold
chiefly
those
who
have
underbid
in
the
contest
for
thompson
he
was
corroborated
by
many
outside
the
for
some
he
could
make
his
escape
the
savage
conscripts
serving
as
carceleros
vented
their
hatred
of
the
gringos
at
every
opportunity
and
made
their
lives
constantly
miserable
by
watching
for
the
slightest
breaking
of
the
rules
to
give
them
an
excuse
to
shoot
in
former
times
when
rubber
was
high
in
price
the
intendente
de
la
policía
frequently
sold
prisoners
to
the
rubber
kings
of
the
beni
at
bolivianos
a
head
and
it
was
a
rare
victim
of
this
system
who
did
not
end
his
days
as
a
virtual
slave
in
the
amazonian
forests
as
we
shook
hands
at
the
gate
of
the
inner
patio
thompson
remarked
if
montes
signs
it
i
ll
have
hours
left
with
nothing
to
do
and
i
ll
write
you
something
i
believe
the
thoughts
of
a
man
waiting
to
be
shot
was
the
only
time
he
used
that
word
during
the
would
make
interesting
reading
the
ending
would
be
all
right
if
these
indians
could
make
a
good
job
of
it
but
they
ll
end
by
bashing
in
my
head
with
the
butts
of
their
muskets
as
they
have
all
the
if
i
have
inadvertently
given
the
impression
that
there
are
no
stern
laws
and
rules
of
personal
conduct
in
santa
cruz
de
la
sierra
let
me
hasten
to
disavow
it
as
quickly
as
i
was
disabused
in
the
matter
myself
for
it
was
here
that
i
tarnished
my
hitherto
spotless
record
for
in
south
america
i
had
come
to
give
thompson
a
bundle
of
american
weeklies
and
was
leaving
the
prison
again
when
a
german
who
had
ridden
in
from
cochabamba
asked
me
to
serve
as
interpreter
while
he
procured
a
gun
license
as
we
stepped
into
the
comandancia
an
anemic
youth
in
uniform
shouted
in
the
most
insolent
tone
at
his
command
take
off
your
hats
the
german
quickly
snatched
his
bullet
head
bare
but
the
tone
aroused
my
antagonism
in
spite
of
myself
moreover
a
dozen
unwashed
natives
lounged
about
the
miserable
mud
hall
with
their
hats
on
to
obey
the
orders
of
this
class
of
officials
requires
a
certain
degree
of
humility
of
which
thank
god
i
have
not
a
trace
at
the
second
command
i
retorted
what
for
in
respect
for
the
bolivian
government
shrieked
the
official
behind
the
main
desk
but
i
have
no
respect
whatever
for
the
bolivian
government
i
protested
warding
off
with
an
elbow
the
boy
soldier
who
was
attempting
to
snatch
the
hat
from
my
head
and
i
stepped
out
into
the
street
there
i
was
legally
immune
there
is
no
law
requiring
one
to
uncover
in
the
streets
even
in
santa
cruz
but
the
legal
aspect
of
a
case
is
easily
overlooked
in
bolivia
the
official
screamed
cabo
de
la
guardia
and
there
poured
out
upon
me
five
boy
soldiers
with
loaded
muskets
who
clutching
at
me
like
cats
began
pushing
me
back
into
the
prison
i
had
been
long
enough
a
policeman
myself
to
know
the
folly
of
resisting
arrest
however
unjustified
moreover
there
was
an
entire
regiment
of
these
little
brown
fellows
in
town
most
of
whom
would
be
only
too
happy
to
give
vent
to
their
dislike
of
gringos
once
i
had
entered
an
empty
mud
room
on
the
first
patio
the
door
was
quickly
bolted
behind
me
and
i
stood
looking
out
through
the
window
upon
the
yard
back
and
forth
across
which
marched
the
jeering
little
soldiers
and
several
loungers
grinning
at
me
nastily
behind
their
blackened
stumps
of
teeth
i
was
in
great
i
should
be
late
for
the
dinner
to
which
i
had
been
invited
at
eleven
for
though
my
arrest
was
not
legal
those
responsible
for
it
had
the
very
simple
old
expedient
of
holding
me
incomunicado
and
keeping
everyone
outside
ignorant
of
my
plight
i
sat
down
on
the
and
fell
to
reading
the
spanish
paper
edition
of
ernst
haeckel
i
was
so
fortunate
as
to
have
with
me
a
passed
meanwhile
that
dinner
was
a
bare
hour
away
and
formal
feasts
are
not
so
frequent
in
tropical
bolivia
as
to
be
missed
without
regret
luckily
i
caught
tommy
s
eye
as
he
dodged
under
the
eaves
to
escape
a
new
and
beckoning
him
to
the
window
managed
to
say
before
he
was
driven
off
by
three
soldiers
with
fixed
bayonets
go
tell
the
prefect
the
matter
never
got
as
far
as
the
prefect
no
sooner
did
the
comandante
of
the
prison
learn
that
a
man
who
only
yesterday
had
been
hobnobbing
with
the
supreme
chief
of
the
department
had
been
visited
with
the
indignity
of
imprisonment
than
he
hastened
to
order
me
set
at
liberty
before
we
leave
santa
cruz
the
story
of
thompson
permits
a
bit
of
anticipation
months
later
in
far
southern
chile
i
chanced
to
pick
up
a
newspaper
among
the
scant
foreign
despatches
of
which
my
eye
fell
upon
bolivia
santa
cruz
de
la
sierra
was
shot
the
criminal
thompson
of
english
nationality
condemned
to
the
supreme
penalty
for
having
assassinated
the
conductors
of
money
of
some
local
another
passed
before
there
reached
me
in
brazil
local
papers
and
letters
giving
details
according
to
these
the
judge
wept
when
he
read
the
sentence
but
thompson
shook
hands
with
him
telling
him
the
sentence
was
just
and
that
the
only
criticism
he
had
to
offer
was
that
the
execution
had
been
so
long
delayed
as
his
last
favor
he
asked
that
jail
conditions
be
improved
that
his
friends
might
be
more
humanly
housed
on
his
last
night
he
got
permission
to
have
a
few
of
dinner
with
him
but
refused
to
touch
liquor
himself
so
i
shall
be
able
to
take
in
every
detail
in
the
morning
he
informed
friends
that
he
had
parents
brothers
and
sisters
in
london
and
a
wife
and
son
in
the
united
states
to
these
he
had
been
writing
since
his
arrest
that
he
was
engaged
in
an
enterprise
that
would
in
time
make
him
rich
if
luck
was
with
him
on
the
evening
before
his
execution
he
wrote
bidding
them
all
farewell
saying
he
had
suddenly
contracted
a
tropical
disease
the
doctors
despaired
of
and
would
be
dead
by
the
time
they
got
the
letter
he
was
shot
at
noon
while
the
bells
of
the
cathedral
were
striking
so
that
nothing
should
be
heard
outside
the
prison
in
santa
cruz
tommy
fell
victim
to
that
loathsome
ailment
popularly
known
as
cold
an
attack
of
fever
and
a
hazy
promise
of
employment
for
his
trusty
trowel
were
no
doubt
among
the
causes
it
is
probable
too
that
he
had
not
entirely
lost
faith
in
the
attractiveness
of
sandy
hair
but
the
inoculation
was
chiefly
due
to
the
replies
to
our
inquiries
about
the
road
ahead
these
were
not
exactly
reassuring
it
was
characteristic
of
tommy
however
that
he
pretended
to
be
eager
to
push
on
while
secretly
planning
to
remain
behind
there
is
one
of
the
sand
streets
of
santa
cruz
de
la
sierra
which
does
not
run
out
to
nothing
in
the
surrounding
jungle
but
dwindles
to
what
is
known
locally
as
the
camino
de
chiquitos
and
pushes
on
to
the
paraguay
river
some
miles
distant
road
in
the
cruceño
sense
however
means
anything
but
a
comfortable
highway
as
usual
the
town
was
scornful
of
the
suggestion
that
two
lone
gringos
could
make
the
journey
on
foot
disheartening
stories
assailed
us
of
the
dangers
from
snakes
and
tigers
of
the
unending
pest
of
insects
of
the
almost
total
lack
of
and
even
of
supplies
for
the
first
week
we
must
carry
all
food
with
us
in
this
rainy
season
the
route
was
sure
to
abound
with
and
miles
of
swamps
the
last
twenty
leagues
near
the
paraguay
would
be
completely
inundated
and
impassable
for
months
until
the
waters
subsided
or
if
the
rains
did
not
come
on
at
their
accustomed
time
there
was
as
much
danger
of
the
country
being
wholly
waterless
for
long
distances
moreover
beyond
the
rio
guapay
eight
leagues
east
of
the
capital
stretched
the
notorious
monte
grande
a
dense
unbroken
forest
in
which
roamed
wild
indians
given
to
shooting
arrows
of
or
black
palm
from
their
bows
with
such
force
that
they
pass
clear
through
a
man
at
fifty
yards
this
was
said
to
be
quite
painful
nor
were
these
mere
idle
rumors
we
had
only
to
drop
in
on
one
of
several
men
in
town
to
be
shown
arrows
taken
from
the
bodies
of
victims
and
a
sojourning
had
several
relics
of
the
tribe
he
had
had
the
good
fortune
to
see
first
while
prospecting
on
the
banks
of
the
guapay
reading
tommy
s
real
opinion
of
the
journey
behind
his
face
i
laid
plans
to
continue
alone
experienced
travelers
asserted
that
boiled
water
a
careful
diet
a
selected
waterproofs
a
tropical
helmet
and
a
woolen
for
night
chills
were
prime
necessities
i
had
all
but
six
of
this
requisites
by
choice
i
should
have
turned
rural
native
entirely
and
worn
a
straw
hat
a
breechclout
a
pair
of
leather
sandals
and
a
towel
but
life
can
seldom
be
reduced
to
such
charming
simplicity
two
things
at
least
were
indispensable
cloth
hammock
and
a
to
hang
over
it
for
the
only
on
most
of
the
journey
would
be
that
which
the
traveler
carried
with
him
then
i
must
hacer
tapeque
as
they
say
in
santa
cruz
or
pack
a
bag
of
rice
and
some
sheets
of
beef
to
say
nothing
of
distributing
about
my
person
a
kodak
revolver
cartridges
and
money
in
various
forms
of
metal
add
to
this
a
few
indispensable
garments
sealed
tins
of
salt
and
matches
kitchenette
photographic
and
writing
materials
and
the
other
unavoidable
odds
and
ends
for
a
scantily
inhabited
trip
of
unknown
duration
and
it
will
be
readily
understood
why
after
mailing
the
and
even
my
coat
razor
and
accessories
i
staggered
heavily
across
town
on
january
to
begin
the
longest
single
leg
of
my
south
american
journey
fortunately
the
german
who
had
sought
my
assistance
in
the
matter
of
the
gun
license
was
bound
for
at
least
a
few
days
in
the
same
direction
heinrich
konanz
born
in
karlsruhe
had
served
the
last
of
three
years
as
a
conscript
in
the
expedition
against
the
chinese
boxers
and
had
since
worked
as
a
carpenter
in
china
and
california
until
he
had
concluded
to
seek
a
permanent
home
as
a
colonist
in
some
region
where
population
was
less
numerous
he
was
largely
innocent
of
geography
spoke
habitually
a
painful
cross
between
his
once
native
tongue
and
what
he
fondly
fancied
was
english
with
a
peppering
of
chinese
and
knew
almost
no
spanish
the
mule
that
had
carried
him
from
cochabamba
he
found
it
necessary
to
turn
into
a
for
the
tools
materials
and
provisions
he
had
purchased
in
santa
cruz
and
was
to
continue
on
foot
he
had
been
placidly
making
plans
to
push
on
alone
when
rumors
in
his
own
tongue
suddenly
reached
him
of
the
monte
grande
and
its
playful
indians
his
first
inclination
had
been
to
throw
up
the
sponge
and
return
to
cochabamba
but
his
capital
had
been
greatly
reduced
and
his
hotel
room
was
heaped
with
the
supplies
sold
him
by
his
local
who
would
not
have
taken
them
back
at
a
fourth
of
the
original
cost
he
made
a
virtue
of
necessity
added
a
new
rifle
to
his
revolver
and
shotgun
and
offered
to
find
room
on
the
mule
for
the
heavier
portion
of
my
baggage
in
return
for
the
reassurance
of
my
company

it
was
a
brilliant
day
when
i
shouldered
the
german
s
rifle
my
own
revolver
well
oiled
and
freshly
loaded
and
led
the
way
out
of
town
along
which
we
picked
our
way
on
rows
of
the
whitened
skulls
of
cattle
soon
gave
place
to
a
great
pampa
with
tall
coarse
grass
and
scattered
trees
across
which
lay
a
silent
sand
road
so
utterly
dry
that
we
had
already
suffered
long
from
thirst
when
we
reached
the
first
well
a
thick
with
green
slime
attesting
by
its
taste

also
visible
fact
that
all
the
cattle
for
miles
around
made

took
to
lapping
up

and
the
footprints

cattle
along
the
trail
i
held
out

i
overtook
a

day

met

forest
closed
in
about
us
and
we
plodded
on
through
deep
sand
alternating
with
soon
all
the
woods
about
us
were
screaming
like
a
dozen
suffragette
meetings
in
full
session
and
fancying
the
uproar
came
from
edible
wild
fowls
i
crept
in
upon
them
rifle
in
hand
to
my
astonishment
i
found
a
band
of
small
monkeys
shrieking
together
in
a
huge
even
a
monkey
steak
would
not
have
been
unacceptable
i
fired
into
the
branches
instantly
there
fell
not
the
wherewithal
for
a
sumptuous
evening
repast
but
the
most
absolute
silence
the
little
creatures
did
not
flee
however
but
each
sprang
a
limb
or
two
higher
and
watched
my
slightest
movement
with
brilliant
roving
eyes
a
qualm
came
upon
me
and
i
hurried
after
the
german
that
night
we
camped
in
a
clump
of
trees
about
a
the
native
who
pointed
out
the
trail
to
it
did
so
in
a
surly
regretful
manner
as
if
he
resented
the
consumption
by
strangers
who
should
have
remained
in
their
own
country
of
a
priceless
treasure
insufficient
for
home
consumption
down
at
the
bottom
of
a
deep
hole
in
the
sand
strongly
fenced
with
split
rails
was
an
irregular
puddle
barely
four
inches
deep
full
of
fallen
leaves
wrigglers
and
decayed
vegetable
matter
yet
from
it
radiated
trails
in
all
directions
the
blocks
of
crude
brown
sugar
we
had
purchased
that
morning
had
melted
during
the
day
and
smeared
everything
within
reach
the
boiled
leg
of
mutton
already
whispered
its
condition
to
the
nostrils
the
breeze
a
slight
knoll
promised
treacherously
died
down
and
the
swarms
of
insects
that
sung
about
us
all
night
frequently
struck
home
in
spite
of
the
that
kept
us
running
with
sweat
until
near
dawn
monkeys
were
already
howling
in
the
nearby
woods
when
we
pulled
on
our
clothes
wet
and
sticky
in
a
soggy
morning
that
soon
carried
out
its
promise
of
rain
and
parrots
now
and
then
screamed
at
us
in
mood
a
heavy
shower
paused
for
a
new
start
and
became
a
true
jungle
deluge
my
poncho
would
have
been
useless
besides
it
was
wrapped
in
australian
swag
style
around
my
possessions
on
the
mule
past
experience
told
me
that
the
only
reliable
waterproof
in
the
tropics
is
to
let
it
dry
out
again
when
opportunity
offers
we
settled
down
to
splash
on
indifferently
soaked
through
and
through
from
hat
to
shoes
dripping
at
every
seam
the
weather
was
not
over
warm
either
and
only
the
heaviest
moments
of
the
storm
dispersed
the
swarms
of
ravenous
mosquitoes
in
dense
woods
punctuated
with
a
yellow
youth
in
two
cotton
garments
overtook
us
well
on
in
the
afternoon
and
asked
if
we
would
need
a
we
would
he
stopped
at
a
jungle
hut
some
distance
beyond
and
emerged
with
an
entire
and
still
covered
with
the
long
red
hair
of
its
original
owner
folded
in
four
like
a
sheet
of
writing
paper
on
his
head
for
a
mile
or
more
he
plodded
noiselessly
behind
us
then
suddenly
the
forest
opened
out
upon
the
notorious
guapay
or
rio
grande
a
stream
wide
as
the
lower
connecticut
flowing
swiftly
northward
to
join
the
mamoré
on
its
journey
to
the
amazon
we
splashed
a
mile
or
more
up
along
its
edge
to
offset
the
distance
we
should
be
carried
downstream
before
striking
a
landing
opposite
here
two
men
of
skin
each
completely
naked
but
for
a
hat
securely
tied
on
relieved
our
companion
of
his
load
and
set
about
turning
it
into
a
boat
these
pelotas
de
cuero
leather
balls
are
the
ferries
of
all
this
region
being
transportable
whereas
a
wooden
boat
left
behind
would
be
stolen
by
the
indios
around
the
edge
of
the
hide
were
a
dozen
loopholes
through
which
was
threaded
a
cord
that
drew
it
up
into
the
form
of
a
rude
tub
to
add
firmness
to
this
the
laid
a
corduroy
of
green
poles
in
the
bottom
then
they
piled
our
baggage
into
it
set
the
german
atop
and
dragged
it
down
the
sloping
mud
bank
into
the
water
while
the
youth
coaxed
the
mule
into
the
stream
and
swam
with
it
for
the
opposite
shore
this
seemed
load
enough
and
to
spare
but
when
i
had
fulfilled
my
duties
as
official
photographer
of
the
expedition
i
too
was
lifted
in
as
they
would
no
doubt
have
piled
in
tommy
also
had
he
been
with
us
and
away
we
went
easily
pounds
speeding
down
the
racing
yellow
stream
the
naked
ferrymen
first
wading
then
swimming
beside
us
clutching
the
pelota
the
gunwales
of
which
were
in
places
by
no
means
an
inch
above
the
water
had
the
cord
broken
the
hide
would
instantly
have
flattened
out
and
left
an
passengers
on
the
magic
carpet
of
oriental
before
and
high
above
us
where
the
coaxed
the
crazy
craft
ashore
stretching
like
a
chinese
wall
of
vegetation
further
than
the
eye
could
follow
in
either
direction
stood
an
impenetrable
forest
the
famous
monte
grande
or
great
wilderness
of
bolivia
here
was
the
chief
haunt
of
the
wild
indians
of
the
penetrating
arrow
a
region
otherwise
uninhabited
through
which
the
road
to
the
paraguay
squeezes
its
way
for
hundreds
of
miles
almost
without
a
shift
of
direction
we
swung
our
hammocks
on
the
extreme
edge
of
the
river
where
the
breeze
promised
to
failed
of
its
promise
like
most
things
for
though
the
day
was
not
yet
spent
the
journey
through
the
monte
grande
is
fixed
in
its
itinerary
by
the
four
garrisons
maintained
some
five
leagues
apart
by
the
bolivian
government
as
a
theoretical
protection
against
the
nomadic
indians
at
dusk
a
man
swam
the
river
with
his
clothing
and
possessions
in
the
brim
of
his
hat
and
soon
afterward
the
stream
began
to
rise
so
rapidly
that
it
is
doubtful
if
we
could
have
passed
it
for
several
days
almost
at
once
in
the
morning
we
met
a
train
of
nine
enormous
roofed
carts
of
merchandise
from
europe
by
way
of
montevideo
each
drawn
by
eight
yoke
of
gaunt
oxen
straining
through
the
mire
at
a
turtle
s
pace
the
forest
crowded
them
so
closely
on
either
hand
that
we
must
back
into
it
as
into
the
shallow
niche
of
an
inca
wall
and
stand
erect
and
motionless
until
the
train
had
crawled
by
the
wilderness
bawling
and
echoing
a
with
the
cries
of
the
dozen
drivers
with
their
long
goads
dodging
in
and
out
in
mud
among
the
panting
brutes
we
met
no
other
person
during
the
day
travelers
through
the
monte
grande
go
always
in
bands
and
the
stared
at
us
setting
out
alone
as
at
gringo
madmen
we
deployed
in
campaign
formation
our
revolvers
loose
in
their
holsters
the
german
marched
ahead
closely
followed
by
his
affectionate
mool
while
i
brought
up
the
rear
with
his
new
winchester
mine
was
the
post
of
honor
and
most
promise
for
the
indians
of
the
monte
grande
do
not
face
their
intended
victims
but
spring
from
behind
a
tree
to
shoot
the
traveler
in
the
back
and
dodge
back
out
of
sight
again
they
shoot
seated
using
the
feet
to
stretch
the
bow
a
slight
advantage
in
point
of
time
to
their
prey
rumor
has
it
that
the
tribe
is
by
nature
peaceful
but
they
were
long
hunted
for
sport
and
are
still
shot
on
sight
with
no
questions
asked
and
so
have
come
to
look
upon
all
travelers
as
tribal
enemies
they
are
said
to
be
entirely
nomadic
to
wear
nothing
but
a
feather
clout
and
to
bind
their
limbs
in
childhood
so
that
the
forearm
and
the
leg
below
the
knee
become
mere
bone
and
sinew
with
which
they
can
thrust
their
way
through
the
spiny
undergrowth
without
pain
this
improvement
on
nature
draws
the
foot
out
of
shape
and
the
footprint
of
a
savage
showing
only
the
imprint
of
the
heel
the
outer
edge
of
the
foot
and
the
crooked
big
toe
is
easily
distinguished
from
that
of
the
ordinary
native
however
that
was
not
my
lucky
day
and
i
caught
not
so
much
as
a
at
a
feather
clout
though
i
glanced
frequently
over
my
shoulder
all
the
day
through
but
if
the
indians
failed
us
there
were
other
visitations
to
make
up
for
them
every
instant
of
the
day
we
fought
swarms
of
gnats
and
mosquitos
though
the
sun
rarely
got
a
peep
in
upon
us
its
damp
heavy
heat
kept
us
with
the
salt
sweat
in
our
eyes
the
road
was
really
a
long
tunnel
through
unbroken
forest
meeting
overhead
into
which
the
thorny
undergrowth
crowded
in
spite
of
the
traffic
all
day
long
often
for
long
distances
completely
occupied
the
narrow
forest
lane
the
region
being
utterly
flat
the
waters
of
the
rainy
season
gather
in
the
slightest
depression
which
passing
plough
into
a
slough
beyond
description
while
the
barest
suggestion
of
a
stream
inundates
to
a
swamp
all
the
surrounding
territory
for
the
first
mile
we
sought
in
our
inexperience
to
tear
our
way
around
these
through
the
edge
of
the
forest
but
so
dense
was
this
that
it
barred
us
as
effectually
as
a
cactus
hedge
we
took
to
wading
now
to
the
knees
now
to
the
waist
sometimes
slipping
into
unseen
and
plunging
to
the
shoulders
in
noisome
slime

it
grew
monotonous
but
so
does
life
under
the
best
of
conditions
moreover
whatever
gloom
our
surroundings
created
was
more
than
offset
by
the
german
not
that
he
was
gay
nor
indeed
cheerful
under
adversity
but
the
genuine
comedian
like
an
italian
hamlet
has
no
inkling
of
his
humor
konanz
was
at
his
best
when
he
fancied
himself
most
tragic
putting
me
frequently
to
excruciating
labor
to
preserve
outwardly
that
solemn
gravity
that
was
indispensable
to
peace
between
us
he
insisted
on
speaking
this
astounding
tongue
he
had
concocted
by
the
simple
rule
of
learning
the
corresponding
english
for
each
german
word
and
jealously
retaining
the
german
grammar
and
form
all
this
with
so
guttural
an
accent
that
the
hearer
could
not
distinguish
lake
from
thus
i
was
informed
that
he
put
it
his
hat
in
and
he
set
him
by
a
boat
the
river
our
was
of
that
affectionate
nature
that
craves
constant
companionship
but
the
teuton
had
no
affection
to
spare
and
whenever
the
animal
chanced
to
stray
a
yard
from
the
spot
in
which
he
had
left
her
he
fell
upon
the
poor
brute
with
a
bellow
of
rage

we
waded
through
a
barred
gate
into
the
or
tiny
natural
clearing
of
cañada

the
first
of
the
four
five
miserable
thatched
huts
some
without
walls
and
the
others
of
poles
set
upright
were
occupied
by
eight
boyish
soldiers
in
faded
rags
of
khaki
and
ancient
cork
helmets
of
the
same
color
and
a
slattern
female
belonging
to
the
lieutenant
the
latter
was
a
haughty
fellow
of
sallow
with
fever
and
gaunt
from
long
tropical
residence
a
graduate
of
the
bolivian
west
point
in
la
paz
and
permanently
in
command
of
all
the
garrisons
of
the
monte
grande
the
others
were
conscripts
between
nineteen
and
assigned
to
the
forts
for
a
year
usually
to
be
forgotten
by
the
government
and
left
there
months
longer
our
official
paper
ordered
the
commander
to
give
us
all
facilities
wood
and
water
and
to
sell
us
there
was
he
waved
a
hand
in
a
bored
tropical
way
and
two
of
the
handsomest
children
in
uniform
brought
us
wood
and
soon
came
lugging
a
huge
bucket
of
water
on
a
pole
across
their
shoulders
what
food
could
he
sell
us
not
a
thing
some

at

we
have
only
half
rations
of

but
the
prefect
said
we
could
depend
the
prefect
señor
has
not
sent
us
any
supplies
for
more
than
a
month
there
was
nothing
left
but
to
cook
some
of
our
own
rice
and
charqui
and
try
to
be
thankful
for
even
that
miserable
substitute
for
food
its
staying
powers
were
slight
twice
during
the
night
i
ate
a
large
plate
of
it
cold
and
spent
most
of
the
time
hungry
at
that
not
that
i
got
up
to
eat
much
of
the
night
i
wandered
up
and
down
the
pascana
fighting
the
mosquitos
and
a
tiny
gnat
whose
bite
was
out
of
all
proportion
to
its
size
and
which
the
fine
gauze
mosquitero
designed
for
the
purpose
by
no
means
kept
out
though
it
did
effectually
any
breeze
that
stirred
the
lieutenant
insisted
on
sending
along
a
soldier
to
protect
us
from
the
savages
he
was
a
boy
of
indian
features
armed
with
an
ancient
winchester
of
broken
butt
thick
with
rust
inside
and
out
most
of
the
day
he
lagged
far
behind
for
the
stretches
of
road
between
the
swamps
and
hurt
even
his
calloused
feet
we
tramped
unbrokenly
for
seven
hours
the
endless
close
on
either
hand
without
sighting
another
human
being
until
the
jungle
opened
out
slightly
on
the
little
pascana
of
tres
cruces
the
sergeant
in
command
dragged
himself
out
a
few
yards
to
meet
us
a
having
warned
him
of
our
approach
he
had
four
soldiers
and
a
female
they
called
the
bucketful
they
brought
us
from
a
swamp
excellent
it
clear
to
be
sure
and
a
decided
improvement
on
what
we
had
drunk
from
the
during
the
day
the
swampy
taste
not
quite
overwhelming
but
it
was
lukewarm
from
lying
out
under
the
sun
and
had
at
least
a
hundred
tadpoles
swimming
merrily
about
in
it
one
dipped
up
a
cupful
picked
out
the
tadpoles
gently
but
firmly
and
forced
as
much
of
their
vacated
bath
as
possible
down
the
feverish
throat
the
gnats
of
tres
cruces
quickly
got
wind
of
the
arrival
of
fresh
supplies
and
attacked
us
in
battalions
the
previous
camp
had
been
gnatless
compared
to
this
known
to
the
natives
as
they
are
almost
invisible
yet
they
can
bite
through
a
woolen
garment
or
a
cloth
hammock
so
effectively
that
the
mosquito
s
puny
efforts
pass
unnoticed
in
comparison
wherever
they
alight
they
leave
a
red
spot
the
size
of
a
that
itches
and
burns
for
days
afterward
what
such
a
host
of
them
had
hoped
to
feed
on
had
we
not
unexpectedly
turned
up
i
can
not
guess
surely
they
were
taking
long
chances
of
starvation
here
in
the
unpeopled
wilderness
under
no
circumstances
did
they
give
us
a
moment
of
respite
even
the
soldiers
tropical
born
and
long
accustomed
to
them
ate
their
supper
plate
in
hand
marching
swiftly
up
and
down
the
and
striking
viciously
at
themselves
with
the
free
hand
we
could
not
leave
off
fighting
them
long
enough
to
lift
a
kettle
off
the
fire
without
a
hundred
instantly
stinging
us
in
as
many
distinct
spots
in
bookless
santa
cruz
i
had
had
the
luck
to
pick
up
a
paper
edition
of
nietzsche
in
spanish
but
even
in
that
tongue
the
journey
through
an
entire
sentence
was
impossible
i
could
not
write
a
word
or
speak
a
sentence
without
pausing
to
slap
savagely
at
some
portion
of
my
anatomy
my
notes
of
those
days
are
all
short
and
choppy
a
long
sentence
was
impossible
it
seemed
unbelievable
so
tiny
a
thing
could
bite
so
the
mosquitero
was
useless
they
could
bite
through
a
real
dinner
would
have
been
a
joy
but
an
hour
s
relief
from
these
incessant
pests
would
have
outdone
a
week
of
banquets
one
wanted
to
run
and
dance
and
scream
but
tired
feet
forbade
much
as
we
needed
rest
we
must
keep
walking
swiftly
up
and
down
the
pascana
wondering
how
long
a
man
would
last
on
charqui
and
rice
walking
day
and
night
oh

konanz
attempting
in

to

aber
here
tramping
doggedly
back
and
forth
in
the
dusk
i
heard
the
sergeant
in
his
hut
singing
and
apparently
happy
i
raced
to
his
door
eureka
necessity
is
the
mother
of
invention
even
among
the
uninventive
he
was
swinging
swiftly
back
and
forth
in
his
hammock
i
grasped
a
and
was
soon
rushing
swiftly
through
the
of
a
circle
the
relief
was
startling
but
to
work
incessantly
with
the
arms
was
little
better
than
tramping
the
pascana
if
only
the
inventor
of
perpetual
motion
had
not
put
his
invention
off
so
long
the
relief
from
torture
quickly
made
me
drowsy
but
if
the
swinging
flagged
for
an
instant
the
jejenes
at
once
brought
me
wide
awake
before
long
too
a
few
hardy
gnats
solved
the
problem
of
catching
their
prey
on
the
fly
like
experienced
more
and
more
learned
the
trick
until
i
gave
up
in
despair
and
took
once
more
to
tramping
the
kept
it
up
indeed
most
of
the
brilliant
moonlit
night
in
the
morning
i
found
that
ants
had
eaten
into
decorative
fringes
the
edges
of
my
leather
leggings
vampire
bats
had
smeared
our
white
mule
with
her
own
blood
for
a
long
time
i
could
not
make
the
german
understand
what
had
happened
to
the
animal
until
i
dug
up
out
of
the
depths
of
memory
the
word
to
watch
him
pack
was
always
a
torture
he
had
learned
to
do
everything
in
the
german
style
of
systematized
routine
in
which
the
longest
way
round
is
always
the
shortest
way
between
two
points
and
he
knew
nothing
of
efficiency
of
that
dovetailing
of
work
in
such
a
way
as
to
hasten
the
process
instead
of
lighting
a
fire
first
and
having
his
breakfast
ready
by
the
time
he
was
dressed
he
must
be
entirely
garbed
before
touching
a
stick
or
a
pot
and
so
on
clear
through
the
loading
however
often
he
made
up
the
pack
each
detail
must
be
laboriously
thought
out
again
and
as
he
could
never
think
of
more
than
one
thing
at
a
time
the
operation
was
endless
bring
him
what
he
needed
to
load
next
and
he
stared
at
me
as
if
wondering
why
i
was
trying
to
disturb
his
meditations
though
we
rose
at
dawn
we
were
fortunate
to
be
off
before
the
sun
had
surmounted
the
jungle
the
sergeant
insisted
languidly
and
tropically
on
sending
one
of
his
armed
boys
along
we
refused
should
anything
have
happened
to
the
child
such
as
a
sprained
ankle
in
protecting
us
from
the
savages
we
could
never
have
forgiven
ourselves
all
day
long
we
tramped
due
eastward
through
unbroken
forest
monotonously
the
swamps
and
continued
it
would
not
have
been
so
bad
could
we
have
waded
all
the
way
barefoot
but
the
stretches
between
made
shoes
imperative
never
a
patch
of
clearing
never
a
sign
of
human
i
still
glanced
frequently
over
my
the
suggestion
of
a
breeze
to
temper
the
heat
or
to
break
the
ranks
of
the
swarming
insects
we
threw
ourselves
at
any
or
gratefully
to
drink
it
was
crawlin
an
it
stunk
but
that
can
by
any
stretch
of
the
word
be
called
water
is
only
too
welcome
in
tropical
bolivia
the
poison
with
which
the
gnats
of
days
past
had
inoculated
us
from
head
to
foot
itched
murderously
amateur
wilderness
travelers
have
a
theory
that
dope
smeared
over
the
body
will
afford
protection
in
such
cases
but
it
would
be
a
strong
concoction
indeed
that
could
rout
the
jejenes
of
the
monte
grande
the
only
method
is
to
get
bit
and
heal
again
as
one
gets
wet
and
dries
again
or
goes
astray
and
finds
oneself
again
the
one
absolute
rule
is
t
scratch
not
to
scratch
may
drive
the
sufferer
mad
but
to
do
so
will
drive
him
doubly
insane
and
swamp
water
is
infectious
to
any
abrasion
of
the
skin
and
an
open
sore
is
the
greatest
peril
of
tropical
travel
let
it
not
be
fancied
however
that
life
was
sad
even
with
these
drawbacks
the
song
of
the
jungle
was
unbroken
the
brilliant
sunshine
joyful
for
all
its
heat
in
places
the
road
was
completely
veiled
by
clouds
of
beautiful
white
butterflies
sweating
freely
there
was
a
spontaneous
play
of
the
mental
spirits
and
a
sense
of
splendid
physical
not
the
gloom
of
our
northern
winters
up
on
the
high
plateau
the
mind
might
work
as
freely
but
with
this
difference
there
it
seemed
to
be
using
itself
up
each
period
of
exaltation
being
followed
by
the
feeling
that
one
was
much
older
much
more
worn
out
while
here
there
were
no
such
after
effects
though
we
drank
water
which
in
civilization
would
have
caused
us
to
die
of
cramps
within
an
hour
the
constant
sweating
carried
off
its
evil
effects
and
though
gaunt
and
we
both
looked
the
picture
of
the
main
rule
for
keeping
well
in
the
tropics
is
to
live
on
the
country
to
avoid
canned
food
and
dissipation
and
above
all
to
get
plenty
of
hard
exercise
and
exposure
to
the
elements
unfortunately
where
food
is
most
needed
it
is
most
difficult
to
obtain
a
toilsome
eighteen
miles
ended
at
pozo
del
was
something
fetching
about
the
name
of
this
third
fortín
tiger
s
here
were
four
boys
a
cossack
post
in
command
of
a
corporal
also
at
last
there
was
something
for
sale
for
some
one
had
planted
a
patch
of
corn
back
in
the
forest
two
soldiers
brought
us
and
for
ourselves
and
stalks
of
the
same
for
the
mule
the
conscripts
preferred
coffee
and
rice
in
payment
for
money
is
of
slight
value
beyond
the
rio
grande
but
demanded
five
times
what
the
stuff
was
worth
it
was
not
and
was
either
or
overripe
but
was
welcome
for
all
that
we
threw
the
ears
into
the
fire
and
raked
them
out
to
munch
what
was
not
entirely
burned
or
still
raw
the
jejenes
made
it
impossible
to
hold
them
over
the
fire
to
toast
we
squatted
so
closely
over
the
blaze
it
all
but
burned
our
garments
yet
the
relief
was
so
great
in
spite
of
the
smoke
in
our
eyes
that
we
all
but
fell
asleep
into
the
fire
the
life
of
these
garrisons
is
dismal
in
the
extreme
the
soldiers
had
absolutely
no
drill
or
other
fixed
duty
in
most
cases
they
were
too
apathetic
to
plant
anything
even
to
dig
a
well
however
heavily
time
hung
on
their
hands
preferring
to
starve
on
to
choke
in
the
dry
season
and
drink
mud
in
the
wet
rather
than
to
exert
themselves
each
fort
had
in
the
center
of
the
a
crude
made
of
a
sapling
but
it
was
used
only
for
a
languid
moment
when
utter
ennui
drove
some
one
to
it
the
impossibility
of
among
was
never
more
clearly
demonstrated
than
by
the
fact
that
each
soldier
cooked
his
own
food
separately
three
times
a
day
over
his
own
stick
fire
there
was
not
faith
enough
among
them
even
to
permit
division
of
labor
in
bringing
each
set
his
a
soldier
s
tin
shaped
to
fit
between
the
shoulders
on
the
ends
of
burning
sticks
and
sat
constantly
on
his
heels
beside
it
lest
it
spill
over
as
one
of
the
fagots
burned
away
the
fellows
were
astonished
to
learn
the
use
of
sticks
for
hanging
their
kettles
toward
morning
i
slept
an
hour
or
two
from
utter
exhaustion
it
was
astonishing
how
one
recuperated
for
all
the
day
ahead
with
so
short
a
rest
after
all
tramping
is
not
like
mental
labor
a
brief
repose
is
all
that
is
necessary
the
savages
having
deceived
us
for
three
days
we
lessened
our
burdens
by
fastening
rifle
and
shotgun
within
quick
reach
on
the
mule
though
still
keeping
our
revolvers
handy
wild
animals
are
commonly
hidden
away
in
the
silence
of
the
forest
even
in
such
wildernesses
and
rarely
cross
a
path
used
by
man
but
they
are
not
always
unseen
we
were
tramping
side
by
side
when
i
pointed
excitedly
at
the
narrowing
vista
of
the
road
ahead
deer
i
cried
the
german
his
mind
perhaps
on
indians
all
but
sprang
over
his
mule
some
two
hundred
yards
ahead
a
reddish
fawn
stood
grazing
and
fresh
meat
would
have
been
more
acceptable
just
then
than
eternal
riches
as
a
soldier
it
was
surely
my
companion
s
place
to
shoot
besides
the
rifle
and
cartridges
were
his
but
he
marched
stolidly
forward
with
no
officer
behind
to
give
a
stentorian
command
his
mind
refused
to
work
every
step
was
increasing
the
probability
of
seeing
a
splendid
venison
repast
for
ourselves
and
for
the
soldiers
ahead
bound
away
into
the
trackless
forest
schüsse
doch
i
cried
in
a
hoarse
whisper
alas
i
had
overlooked
the
preliminary
routine
of
ready
load
aim
the
german
snatched
hastily
and
blindly
at
the
pack
leveled
a
gun
and
fired
a
discharge
of
sprinkled
the
nearby
and
the
startled
deer
sprang
with
one
leap
into
the
unknown
konanz
had
caught
up
the
shotgun
instead
of
the
rifle
it
must
not
be
gathered
however
that
he
was
not
an
effective
hunter
given
prey
fitted
to
his
abilities
all
this
region
is
noted
for
its
a
large
with
the
empty
charred
shells
of
which
any
is
sure
to
be
scattered
during
the
afternoon
the
german
actually
ran
one
down
tied
on
the
pack
it
arrived
at
the
fourth
and
last
of
the
monte
grande
guayritos
a
larger
clearing
surrounded
by
or
swamps
and
noted
for
attacks
by
the
savages
the
corporal
ordered
one
of
his
three
men
to
prepare
the
turtle
he
split
it
open
with
a
machete
and
removing
all
the
meat
spitted
the
liver
the
chief
delicacy
on
a
stick
while
i
set
the
rest
to
boiling
when
it
had
cooked
for
an
hour
the
addition
of
a
handful
of
rice
and
a
chip
of
salty
rock
made
the
most
savory
repast
of
several
days
all
through
the
cooking
konanz
had
sat
moodily
by
fighting
clouds
of
jejenes
and
smoking
furiously
for
protection
when
the
meal
was
ready
he
refused
to
touch
it
evidently
turtle
is
not
eaten
in
the
german
army
but
for
once
the
inner
man
all
but
overcame
the
iron
discipline
of
years
it
may
have
been
the
smoke
that
brought
tears
to
his
eyes
as
i
fell
upon
the
mess
at
any
rate
he
moved
away
from
the
fire
and
went
to
tramp
gloomily
up
and
down
the
edge
of
the
pascana
the
thick
muscles
that
in
life
are
so
strong
that
a
man
can
not
pull
a
leg
from
its
shell
by
main
force
were
of
a
meat
far
superior
to
the
finest
appetite
deceived
almost
boneless
the
comatose
condition
induced
by
the
feast
lasted
with
only
an
occasional
break
all
night
so
that
i
slept
considerably
even
though
the
gnats
roared
about
my
net
like
a
raging
sea
on
a
distant
coast
and
a
few
hundred
managed
to
gain
admittance
a
tropical
shower
was
raging
when
we
finished
loading
even
the
soldiers
were
in
a
snarling
mood
the
going
was
so
slippery
that
it
was
painful
for
long
distances
there
were
or
as
the
interminable
mud
ridges
with
troughs
of
slime
between
them
are
called
every
step
was
perilous
until
we
were
splashed
and
soaked
from
down
after
that
a
misstep
and
a
sprawl
did
not
matter
skeletons
of
oxen
were
numerous
along
the
way
when
the
rain
ceased
the
day
remained
thick
and
the
heat
was
heavy
enough
to
cut
with
a
spade
for
long
stretches
we
waded
through
swamps
of
long
green
grasses
a
few
slight
pascanas
began
to
break
the
endless
forest
in
one
of
them
and
scattered
far
beyond
we
met
the
first
travelers
since
entering
the
woods
rusty
and
wagons
hopelessly
mired
others
with
their
several
yokes
of
oxen
lying
indifferently
in
water
mud
or
on
dry
land
that
afternoon
our
journey
seemed
to
have
come
ignominiously
to
an
end
an
immense
swamp
or
lake
a
wide
spread
across
the
trail
and
far
away
in
both
directions
into
the
now
thinner
forest
the
notorious
curiche
de
we
attempted
to
flank
it
only
to
have
a
faint
side
path
end
in
the
impassable
tangles
of
an
even
greater
swamp
wandering
in
this
for
an
hour
we
regained
the
road
at
last
and
putting
everything
damageable
in
our
hats
and
strapping
our
revolvers
about
our
necks
attempted
the
crossing
the
lake
proved
only
but
the
all
but
swallowed
up
the
mule
and
the
pack
emerged
streaming
water
from
every
corner
the
sun
was
getting
low
when
we
sighted
a
little
wooded
hill
above
the
forest
ahead
the
road
dodged
the
hillock
however
and
we
slushed
hopelessly
on
through
endless
virgin
forest
night
was
coming
on
the
insignificance
of
man
in
these
primeval
woods
was
appalling
suddenly
a
large
cornfield
appeared
in
a
clearing
beside
the
road
but
this
plunged
on
again
into
the
wilderness
without
disclosing
any
other
sign
of
humanity
darkness
was
upon
us
when
a
man
in
white
rode
out
of
the
gloom
ahead
and
all
but
fell
from
his
mule
in
astonishment
we
had
passed
unseen
the
branch
trail
to
the
scattered
hamlet
of
el
cerro
a
score
of
thatched
huts
constituting
the
first
civilian

chapter

skirting
the
gran
chaco
we
took
possession
of
a
a
thatched
roof
on
poles
up
in
the
edge
of
the
jungle
but
the
anticipated
feast
was
scanty
el
cerro
had
little
to
sell
and
less
desire
to
sell
it
konanz
was
so
completely
worn
out
that
he
threw
himself
down
supperless
without
even
swinging
his
after
a
hut
to
hut
canvass
i
coaxed
a
cerrito
to
sell
a
pound
of
fresh
beef
which
with
rice
and
some
little
red
beans
made
such
a
stew
as
roused
even
the
german
from
his
stupor
we
topped
it
off
with
the
succulent
luxury
of
an
a
smeary
block
of
crude
unpurified
sugar
wrapped
in
leaves
and
costing
eight
times
what
it
would
have
in
the
jungles
of
north
peru
of
this
we
each
ate
fully
a
pound
so
great
was
our
craving
for
sweets
gnats
were
few
in
el
cerro
and
we
slept
such
a
night
as
seldom
comes
to
the
tropical
wanderer
two
of
them
for
that
matter
for
a
time
next
morning
it
looked
as
if
i
should
have
to
continue
alone
packing
my
own
food
and
possessions
konanz
liked
the
appearance
of
the
soil
round
about
el
cerro
and
was
half
inclined
to
settle
there
we
went
to
discuss
the
matter
with
the
horseman
of
the
night
before
a
spaniard
long
resident
in
the
region
i
acting
as
interpreter
but
in
spite
of
my
in
trying
not
to
influence
his
plans
the
german
decided
to
push
on
a
few
days
further
chiefly
because
the
best
land
was
largely
held
by
absentee
owners
but
he
insisted
on
resting
for
a
day
we
removed
some
of
the
grime
of
travel
and
dried
out
ourselves
and
possessions
and
in
the
end
even
fed
for
seeing
us
by
daylight
the
people
of
el
cerro
regained
confidence
and
decided
that
they
had
more
to
sell
than
they
had
fancied
for
twenty
centavos
a
woman
brought
us
the
first
bucketful
of
clear
water
we
had
seen
beyond
santa
cruz
i
canvassed
the
town
thoroughly
and
gleaned
some
green
plantains
three
eggs
and
a
sheet
of
charqui
and
finally
metamorphized
sixty
centavos
into
a
spring
chicken
most
of
the
inhabitants
were
too
apathetic
to
plant
anything
to
break
the
endless
monotony
of
their
rice
diet
to
say
nothing
of
being
too
selfish
to
part
with
what
little
they
did
grow
their
clothing
consisted
of
two
calico
garments
and
a
straw
hat
for
the
men
and
a
species
of
flying
for
the
women
and
their
industry
was
chiefly
confined
to
lying
in
a
hammock
in
the
shade
the
women
carried
their
children
astride
a
hip
as
in
the
orient
the
andean
custom
of
slinging
the
papoose
on
the
back
having
entirely
disappeared
each
family
kept
a
smudge
fire
burning
just
outside
the
door
as
a
protection
against
the
jejenes
rested
up
and
somewhat
relieved
from
the
pinch
of
insects
konanz
grew
reminiscent
and
now
and
then
prefaced
some
characteristically
teutonic
anecdote
with
some
such
dreamy
remark
as
in
china
ve
every
day
chip
more
ass
two
hunderd
heads
from
der
boxers
beyond
el
cerro
the
landscape
changes
the
dense
monte
grande
with
its
loam
gives
place
to
a
few
suggestions
of
rocks
and
hills
and
the
and
vegetation
characteristic
of
chiquitos
appear
from
the
panteón
a
bit
of
clearing
in
the
jungle
with
blackened
wooden
crosses
tied
together
with
jungle
creepers
standing
over
the
graves
of
former
residents
of
el
cerro
we
caught
a
through
somewhat
thinner
forest
to
the
scattered
hamlet
of
motococito
so
named
from
the
with
which
the
roofs
are
thatched
then
we
went
on
all
day
without
another
sight
of
humanity
now
and
again
the
trail
undulated
over
little
rocky
ridges
where
the
woods
were
a
bit
more
open
and
the
danger
from
wild
there
ever
was
all
day
the
unshaded
tropical
sun
beat
down
upon
us
like
molten
lead
in
the
afternoon
an
enormous
swamp
with
a
sort
of
growth
protruding
from
the
water
and
thickly
grown
with
slender
out
on
our
left
and
we
should
have
had
to
wade
for
miles
but
for
a
new
trail
recently
cut
along
the
edge
of
the
stony
wooded
hills
not
always
out
of
reach
of
the
rising
waters
birds
large
and
small
from
herons
to
noisy
parrakeets
enlivened
the
vast
flooded
wilderness
about
four
we
made
out
through
the
salt
sweat
in
our
eyes
the
first
beyond
the
rio
grande
and
soon
limped
into
the
corral
of
the
estancia
equito
at
the
foot
of
a
slight
knoll
a
large
house
in
wretched
condition
faced
a
yard
overrun
with
swine
and
carpeted
with
the
trodden
droppings
of
animals
from
the
balcony
above
a
surly
female
grumpily
gave
us
permission
to
spend
the
night
where
we
were
and
offered
no
further
assistance
konanz
had
dropped
on
his
back
in
the
first
patch
of
shade
and
could
not
be
stirred
even
to
unload
the
mule
which
was
as
well
for
when
tired
out
he
was
hopelessly
and
apt
to
be
of
more
annoyance
than
assistance
while
i
piled
our
possessions
into
a
covered
cart
out
of
reach
of
the
militant
pigs
he
complained
of
being
ill
and
for
the
first
time
accepted
some
quinine
pills
evidently
these
are
permitted
the
kaiser
s
troops
once
they
are
visibly
ailing
the
meanness
of
the
was
so
bolivian
that
they
would
not
even
point
out
a
i
hobbled
about
for
some
time
without
finding
anything
better
than
a
which
dogs
fowls
and
the
indian
servants
used
indiscriminately
the
breath
of
the
cattle
corral
drove
off
the
insects
somewhat
but
the
inhabitants
two
and
gave
us
no
peace
where
i
had
swung
the
hammocks
after
much
effort
i
coaxed
the
german
to
his
feet
and
with
half
the
load
on
the
mule
half
on
my
own
back
led
the
way
a
few
hundred
yards
down
the
road
to
some
abandoned
shacks
it
required
a
considerable
tramp
to
gather
dry
wood
and
the
water
sickly
warm
and
had
to
be
carried
a
long
distance
from
a
swamp
completely
covered
with
a
weedy
bulb
luckily
we
had
acquired
in
el
cerro
the
sister
of
yesterday
s
chicken
which
in
spite
of
having
jolted
on
the
pack
all
day
under
the
blazing
sun
was
still
by
the
time
i
had
chipped
off
its
head
performed
the
autopsy
with
a
dull
machete
and
finally
sat
down
to
to
get
up
again
under
the
flagellation
of
tropical
night
had
fallen
and
it
was
not
easy
to
fetch
more
water
to
wash
the
dishes
without
falling
into
the
source
of
supply
the
german
had
not
stirred
since
he
had
dropped
on
his
back
to
drink
a
pail
of
soup
and
eat
two
drumsticks
and
a
wing
then
i
must
fetch
another
sackful
of
water
for
the
sweat
of
the
day
drying
on
the
body
made
the
skin
so
many
square
inches
of
torture
under
the
circumstances
bathing
was
no
easy
task
to
have
calmly
disrobed
would
have
been
to
be
instantly
flayed
alive
by
the
army
of
insects
i
piled
on
brush
until
the
flames
blazed
high
though
artificial
heat
was
not
exactly
required
then
threw
sand
upon
them
until
only
a
heavy
smudge
remained
standing
astride
this
weeping
copiously
mosquitos
and
jejenes
falling
furiously
in
massed
formation
upon
any
patch
of
skin
for
an
instant
unsmoked
i
poured
the
sackful
over
me
and
finally
rolled
into
my
hammock
in
the
streaming
moonlight
between
two
under
the
mosquitero
the
sweat
ran
in
streams
along
my
itching
skin
outside
it
millions
of
insects
fought
to
reach
me
not
a
few
succeeding
bulls
wandered
by
bellowing
in
amorous
anger
now
and
then
one
paused
to
sniff
at
me
pawed
the
earth
savagely
and
thrust
his
snout
and
horns
madly
into
it
long
rolls
of
thunder
sounded
in
the
east
growing
louder
and
nearer
the
flashes
of
lightning
became
almost
continuous
but
the
sudden
coolness
and
the
fleeing
of
the
insects
before
the
rising
wind
gave
such
a
relief
from
torture
that
i
fell
quickly
asleep
suddenly
huge
raindrops
struck
me
in
the
face
and
before
i
could
snatch
down
the
hammock
and
race
for
one
of
the
ruined
shacks
the
skies
were
pouring
then
i
must
go
back
for
my
possessions
the
damageable
portion
of
which
i
had
taken
the
precaution
to
tie
in
a
bundle
konanz
had
gone
to
no
such
trouble
so
that
all
he
owned
was
scattered
over
the
surrounding
country
and
such
things
as
we
were
able
to
snatch
in
the
flashes
of
lightning
proved
in
the
morning
to
be
those
that
could
best
have
stood
a
wetting
we
swung
our
hammocks
again
in
separate
shacks
and
enjoyed
some
relief
from
heat
and
insects
but
only
a
corner
of
the
roof
above
me
did
not
leak
like
a
sieve
and
that
was
not
sufficient
to
cover
more
than
half
my
length
the
rain
had
spoiled
a
tolerable
road
tons
of
which
we
carried
along
in
the
first
fatiguing
miles
of
slipping
and
sliding
with
every
step
all
day
we
slapped
through
der
chungle
with
no
other
sound
than
the
swish
of
our
footsteps
as
monotonously
rhythmical
as
the
ticking
of
a
clock
the
mule
had
transferred
her
affections
to
me
perhaps
because
i
did
not
use
a
cudgel
on
her
flanks
or
torture
her
ears
with
a
stentorial
guttural
bellow
at
every
step
and
no
dog
ever
followed
a
fond
master
more
closely
had
i
climbed
a
tree
the
animal
would
certainly
have
got
up
after
me
somehow
konanz
was
therefore
advanced
to
the
woods
being
a
bit
more
open
we
managed
to
dodge
some
of
the
sloughs
by
crawling
around
them
though
at
the
expense
of
being
torn
and
cut
by
cactus
wild
pineapple
leaves
and
every
known
species
of
thorny
tropical
undergrowth
so
that
each
day
saw
us
bleeding
from
a
score
of
superficial
lacerations
and
our
clothing
rapidly
becoming
a
tissue
of
tatters
but
the
mule
hated
to
wet
her
dainty
feet
and
must
be
pushed
bodily
into
each
and
driven
through
it
with
loud
words
and
clods
even
then
often
turning
back
to
follow
me
through
the
underbrush
once
in
when
i
fancied
her
well
across
a
slough
i
heard
a
crashing
in
the
brush
behind
me
and
turned
just
in
time
to
see
the
affectionate
animal
emerge
stark
naked
from
between
two
trees
the
pack
stripped
completely
off
her

rate
of
travel
about
two
miles
an
hour
now
you
see
vat
you
do
cried
the
german
tearfully
what
who
did
i
demanded
is
it
any
fault
of
mine
that
the
sex
pursues
me
through
thick
and
thin
but
he
was
already
studying
out
which
knot
of
the
to
tackle
first
in
such
an
emergency
in
a
way
it
would
have
been
easier
to
carry
my
own
bundle
than
to
work
for
and
humor
the
german
so
incessantly
a
species
of
tropical
madness
familiar
to
many
travelers
in
the
wilds
frequently
came
upon
him
the
simple
question
of
whether
or
not
he
wished
a
block
to
sit
on
would
bring
from
him
a
roar
of
rage
as
if
he
who
did
not
know
his
wishes
in
the
matter
were
the
king
of
fools
it
was
all
but
impossible
to
keep
up
my
notes
to
say
nothing
of
lifting
myself
above
the
surroundings
by
an
occasional
page
of
nietzsche
if
i
dared
draw
out
pen
or
book
during
a
pause
in
the
shade
at
noonday
steeling
myself
against
the
swarming
insects
my
companion
took
to
looking
askance
at
such
occupation
like
most
by
that
those
who
but
have
not
the
habit
of
subconsciously
resented
such
action
perhaps
it
isn
t
done
in
the
best
circles
of
the
german
army
he
had
not
heard
of
nietzsche
but
admitted
during
a
cheerful
mood
that
it
sounded
like
a
german
name
in
most
cases
he
quickly
found
some
useless
topic
of
conversation
or
some
chore
for
me
to
do
going
so
far
as
to
fly
into
an
open
rage
if
i
ignored
these
hints
his
moods
were
varied
from
the
deepest
gloom
in
which
he
would
not
answer
yes
or
no
to
the
simplest
question
he
would
grow
suddenly
bland
and
garrulous
almost
maudlin
in
his
good
humor
from
no
apparent
cause
and
a
bare
after
some
fit
of
rage
he
would
be
bellowing
songs
of
the
fatherland
in
a
voice
to
call
down
upon
us
all
the
savages
of
the
region
had
the
peril
not
been
neutralized
by
a
lack
of
tunefulness
tending
to
produce
the
opposite
effect
the
german
army
ration
he
took
frequent
occasion
to
specify
consists
of
exactly
so
many
grams
of
this
that
and
the
other
and
konanz
considered
any
man
who
wanted
his
supplies
in
any
other
proportions
a
pervert
a
weakling
and
a
rascal
once
we
passed
a
train
of
laden
with
boxes
of
merchandise
marked
via
montevideo
en
transito
para
bolivia
suggesting
that
the
atlantic
was
becoming
more
accessible
than
the
pacific
most
of
them
also
bore
the
information
ausfuhrgut
denoting
their
origin
and
all
were
so
old
and
that
they
seemed
to
have
been
months
on
the
road
indeed
goods
for
santa
cruz
have
been
known
more
than
once
to
be
two
years
en
route
the
government
seeks
to
make
this
route
more
popular
by
reducing
by
percent
the
duty
on
imports
by
way
of
puerto
suarez
beyond
a
swamp
which
we
managed
only
partly
to
dodge
we
met
a
disorganized
band
of
soldiers
each
attended
by
his
chola
who
might
be
but
probably
in
most
cases
was
not
his
wife
crawling
painfully
toward
santa
cruz
with
strange
assortments
of
odds
and
ends
on
their
backs
including
the
indispensable
hammock
each
and
several
babies
according
to
them
the
next
settlement
was
so
far
distant
that
we
gave
up
hope
of
reaching
it
that
day
and
camped
in
the
road
where
there
was
barely
room
to
pile
our
baggage
beside
a
for
cooking
and
drinking
every
hint
of
breeze
was
cut
off
by
the
forest
walls
high
above
us
and
the
night
that
followed
our
stew
of
rice
beans
and
charqui
was
one
to
be
quickly
possible
stripped
naked
the
sweat
ran
off
me
in
streams
soaking
through
the
hammock
into
this
the
insects
swarmed
in
such
masses
in
spite
of
the
net
that
i
was
forced
to
abandon
it
to
them
entirely
for
a
time
i
tramped
up
and
down
the
road
in
the
moonlight
but
every
few
steps
i
stumbled
half
asleep
i
built
a
fire
about
my
hammock
and
covered
it
with
sand
but
the
smudge
had
little
effect
on
the
insects
and
made
the
heat
and
sweat
all
the
more
unendurable
so
that
i
stumbled
back
and
forth
in
the
roadway
most
of
the
night
we
tramped
four
hours
to
piococa
all
but
falling
on
our
faces
from
sleepiness
and
dodging
the
worst
sloughs
only
by
many
a
struggle
with
the
jungle
here
in
a
small
open
green
backed
by
wooded
hillocks
was
the
of
a
cruceño
to
whom
i
had
a
letter
only
an
indian
girl
stupid
and
filthy
beyond
words
was
there
however
and
we
got
a
and
some
boiled
yuca
at
last
only
by
infinite
coaxing
at
least
there
was
plenty
of
rich
grass
for
the
mule
and
a
clear
running
stream
in
which
i
bathed
and
laundered
and
lay
emerged
most
of
the
afternoon
in
protection
from
the
gnats
in
our
hammocks
under
the
trees
the
insects
were
almost
as
bad
as
ever
the
only
possible
relief
was
to
walk
swiftly
up
and
down
had
i
been
alone
i
should
have
pushed
on
without
a
stop
until
i
reached
a
place
of
rest
but
the
german
was
so
worn
out
that
not
even
the
pinching
of
the
mosquitos
could
stir
him
up
there
was
at
least
a
certain
curiosity
to
know
how
long
the
human
frame
could
hold
up
under
these
unbroken
hardships
at
dusk
three
youths
rode
up
on
saddled
steers
the
chief
means
of
transportation
in
these
parts
the
saddles
were
not
unlike
our
texas
and
the
single
leather
rein
passed
from
the
ring
in
the
nose
over
the
forehead
of
the
animal
between
the
horns
steers
cross
deep
mud
more
easily
than
horses
or
mules
but
are
much
slower
and
more
easily
exhausted
and
the
width
of
their
flanks
makes
long
riding
painful
to
the
hips
the
motion
is
mildly
like
that
of
the
camel
the
natives
sat
for
hours
all
but
motionless
smoking
de
cigarettes
rolled
in
between
a
few
snatches
of
sleep
i
tramped
the
yard
pausing
now
and
then
to
squat
beside
the
fire
that
smudged
all
night
before
the
native
hut
forming
a
veritable
curtain
of
smoke
through
which
the
insects
hesitated
to
pass
the
family
inside
swung
in
their
hammocks
all
the
night
through
what
secret
means
the
people
of
this
region
have
to
keep
their
hammocks
constantly
moving
while
to
all
appearances
they
are
sound
asleep
i
was
never
able
to
learn
more
than
once
i
watched
them
for
a
long
swinging
back
and
forth
with
no
evident
means
of
propulsion
lying
all
but
on
their
backs
one
bare
leg
hanging
over
the
edge
of
the
as
if
these
children
of
the
wilderness
had
long
since
solved
the
problem
of
perpetual
motion
that
civilization
has
so
far
sought
in
vain
in
the
morning
the
tendency
to
fall
down
asleep
in
full
march
remained
the
road
was
wider
and
the
forest
more
open
so
that
the
sun
beat
upon
us
like
an
open
we
paused
to
drink
from
any
or
swamp
and
to
wash
from
our
eyes
the
blinding
sweat
that
quickly
filled
them
again
a
huge
hairy
spider
now
and
then
ran
by
underfoot
the
natives
say
they
are
deadly
we
did
not
halt
to
investigate
beyond
the
breathless
corner
of
the
woods
where
we
cooked
the
last
of
our
beans
we
met
a
welcome
sight
woman
with
a
bundle
on
her
head
not
merely
the
first
traveler
since
passing
the
soldiers
but
a
sign
that
we
were
approaching
a
town
an
hour
further
on
we
waded
a
small
river
climbed
a
gentle
slope
heavy
in
sand
and
found
ourselves
in
a
silent
hamlet
of
sandy
streets
and
an
enormous
plaza
backed
by
a
stone
church
as
out
of
proportion
to
its
surroundings
as
the
escorial
in
its
village
we
had
reached
at
last
the
famous
old
town
of
saint
joseph
the
heels
of

protruded
from

off

no

from
the

but
all
strangers
lodge
in

hobbled
in
at
a

swung
our

and
picketed

on

san

de
chiquitos
is
the
capital
of
a
province
so
named
because
the
early
spaniards
found
the
doors
of
the
native
huts
so
small
as
a
protection
against
gnats
and
their
tribal
enemies
that
they
could
only

may
still
be

a
league
away
at
the
foot
of
a
hill
this
first
settlement
was
later
removed
to
its
present
site
but
in
the
jesuits
established
here
in
what
is
bolivian
territory
under
the
name
of
san
josé
one
of
their
ten
not
even
the
ruins
of
paraguay
the
republic
most
associated
with
the
memory
of
the
loyalists
give
a
better
notion
of
the
establishments
in
which
the
indian
tribes
converted
by
the
good
fathers
were
gathered
to
toil
for
the
safety
of
their
souls
and
the
filling
of
the
coffers
of
the
society
in
paris
the
mission
remains
much
as
it
was
when
the
order
was
expelled
from
spanish
territory
too
isolated
to
be
picked
to
pieces
by
visitors
its
people
too
apathetic
to
make
use
of
its
for
their
own
buildings
these
reductions
were
all
alike
in
plan
large
central
square
was
enclosed
by
a
wall
a
ditch
and
a
stockade
as
much
to
keep
the
converts
from
escaping
as
to
protect
them
from
the
wild
indians
and
the
of
brazil
who
came
in
quest
of
slaves
an
immense
church
in
the
building
of
which
the
padres
made
use
of
their
subjects
as
freely
as
the
pharaohs
stood
high
above
all
else
the
enormous
mission
of
san
josé
conspicuous
in
its
grandeur
amid
the
solitude
of
the
jungle
as
are
the
monuments
of
egypt
in
their
desert
setting
was
built
of
brick
and
stone
under
spanish
artisans
the
tower
bearing
the
date
and
a
stone
in
the
center
of
the
patio
by
which
we
could
still
tell
the
hour
that
of
from
the
summit
of
the
tower
the
town
below
looked
like
an
oasis
in
a
desert
of
dense
green
stretching
on
every
hand
the
huge
bells
were
still
suspended
by
ropes
of
a
vine
used
in
place
of
nails
in
modern
constructions
and
so
strong
and
durable
that
it
has
held
these
immense
masses
in
place
more
than
a
hundred
years
the
tolling
of
striking
even
amid
the
rumble
of
civilization
was
solemn
in
the
extreme
above
the
utter
silence
of
the
trackless
and
savage
tropical
solitudes
the
evidence
is
convincing
that
the
first
jesuits
to
arrive
were
idealists
filled
with
a
zeal
for
converts
that
made
even
trickery
indians
abundance
of
food
dances
and
play
conversion
was
absurdly
simple
catch
an
indian
sprinkle
him
with
holy
water
and
shut
him
up
within
the
mission
stockade
and
his
soul
was
safely
on
the
road
to
heaven
but
once
these
idealists
had
gathered
the
indians
together
and
won
their
confidence
they
were
superseded
by
astute
men
of
keen
business
ability
less
interested
in
saving
souls
than
in
winning
temporal
power
and
earthly
riches
for
their
society
the
later
padres
lived
like
the
princes
of
medieval
europe
surrounded
by
every
luxury
the
forced
labor
of
the
indians
could
buy
with
virtually
a
monopoly
in
trade
having
neither
wages
nor
taxes
to
pay
they
were
almost
wholly
free
from
individual
competition
they
gave
each
indian
the
education
they
considered
fitting
to
his
place
in
life
taught
as
many
trades
as
the
society
had
need
of
forbade
intercourse
with
strangers
or
the
learning
of
the
spanish
language
made
early
marriage
compulsory
often
mating
couples
offhand
as
did
the
incas
and
ruled
over
their
subjects
sternly
requiring
all
to
rise
eat
work
and
sleep
in
unison
at
the
beating
of
a
bell
or
drum
in
short
they
treated
the
converts
like
valuable
domestic
animals
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
the
indian
lived
in
complete
submission
to
the
padres
in
church
and
at
work
there
was
a
complete
segregation
of
the
sexes
under
the
old
régime
but
by
night
all
were
gathered
together
often
several
families
under
the
roof
of
a
single
with
all
the
degeneration
of
customs
thereby
suggested
thanks
to
the
careful
fostering
of
the
race
there
is
said
to
have
been
converts
in
the
reductions
at
the
height
of
jesuit
power
san
josé
is
doubly
notable
historically
for
it
was
here
rumor
has
it
that
the
loyalists
were
planning
to
build
the
capital
of
a
kingdom
of
their
own
when
they
were
overtaken
by
the
decree
banishing
them
from
spanish
dominions
the
last
census
in
jesuit
days
credited
san
josé
with
more
than
inhabitants
it
has
barely
a
fourth
as
many
drowsing
through
life
in
low
mud
huts
scattered
carelessly
along
the
sand
streets
some
three
blocks
on
all
sides
of
the
plaza
not
a
few
of
the
original
converts
of
the
jesuits
suddenly
regaining
their
liberty
at
the
expulsion
of
the
padres
went
back
to
the
bush
which
accounts
for
the
unmistakable
signs
of
european
blood
in
more
than
one
naked
savage
laid
low
by
a
traveler
s
rifle
even
such
reversions
to
type
are
not
unknown
and
this
with
the
drain
of
the
rubber
fields
of
the
beni
has
done
most
to
reduce
the
population
to
its
present
low
ebb
the
inhabitants
belong
to
the
same
general
family
as
the
several
tribes
of
wild
indians
that
attack
travelers
on
the
road
across
bolivia
and
which
are
even
the
terror
of
san
josé
itself
having
more
than
once
assaulted
the
place
with
fury
but
in
the
town
this
indian
blood
is
commonly
mixed
with
negro
or
white
and
though
spanish
is
more
general
the
tongue
a
branch
of
the
guaraní
or
tupy
of
eastern
south
america
is
still
spoken
the
chiquitano
is
in
features
about
the
antithesis
of
our
inherited
greek
idea
of
beauty
his
head
is
round
with
little
or
no
back
to
it
the
hair
thick
and
coarse
as
a
horse
s
mane
his
face
wide
all
its
features
bulky
especially
the
nose
which
recalls
the
negro
as
do
also
the
thick
prominent
lips
his
eyes
are
black
and
rather
small
his
ears
plump
and
prominent
his
teeth
generally
white
and
strong
the
chin
neither
prominent
nor
receding
in
color
he
is
not
unlike
the
the
tint
of
a
tan
shoe
after
a
month
of
wear
and
polish
his
body
is
heavy
and
muscular
though
without
what
we
call
development
of
any
particular
set
of
muscles
this
is
even
more
noticeable
in
the
women
than
among
the
men
the
former
being
more
erect
and
from
carrying
and
other
heavy
loads
on
their
heads
from
childhood
the
feet
are
large
with
strong
toes
their
clothing
is
simple
and
excellently
adapted
to
the
tropics
where
the
looser
the
garment
the
better
the
health
the
men
wear
a
felt
or
straw
hat
and
thin
cotton
jacket
and
trousers
and
generally
white
in
origin
with
a
wide
leather
belt
containing
several
pockets
and
frequently
decorated
with
large
silver
coins
the
women
never
cover
their
heads
and
wear
nothing
whatever
except
the
a
single
loose
gown
thin
and
white
as
a
without
sleeves
and
with
the
neck
cut
as
low
as
is
possible
without
danger
of
losing
the
garment
entirely
in
these
they
frequently
march
into
the
stream
behind
the
the
inhabitants
of
this
tropical
region
are
far
more
cleanly
than
those
of
the
upper
up
the
garment
as
the
water
covers
them
until
it
is
folded
on
the
head
in
the
form
of
a
turban
as
they
arise
from
the
bath
they
unfold
a
clean
gown
so
skillfully
that
the
sharpest
glance
will
catch
nothing
but
tipoy
and
water
as
a
race
the
chiquitanos
are
extremely
independent
and
very
incommunicative
to
any
than
their
own
people
like
all
american
aborigines
they
show
outwardly
very
little
of
their
thoughts
and
impressions
hurrying
is
utterly
unknown
to
them
though
at
times
they
work
with
a
leisurely
steadiness
they
show
few
signs
of
affection
or
on
the
other
hand
of
aversion
or
anger
being
indeed
strangely
like
automatons
or
in
their
deportment
there
is
far
less
religion
or
at
least
outward
sign
of
it
in
these
tropical
towns
than
up
on
the
bleak
andean
plateau
is
it
because
the
highlands
drear
and
mysterious
like
palestine
or
the
wastes
of
arabia
bring
on
a
dread
that
is
not
felt
in
the
tropics
where
nature
is
or
at
least
seems
more
kindly
when
a
native
dies
he
is
buried
at
once
then
his
family
and
friends
start
a
santa
novena
days
of
mourning
in
which
they
gather
together
each
day
to
pray
and
to
drink
themselves
into
complete
intoxication
he
who
has
given
occasion
for
the
festival
is
looked
upon
almost
as
a
benefactor
but
there
is
very
little
hint
of
mysticism
or
worship
in
these
antics
in
the
good
old
days
of
chiquitos
following
the
expulsion
of
the
jesuits
the
brought
each
traveler
a
maid
for
his
service
it
is
the
mothers
or
sisters
who
offer
the
guest
of
the
monastery
a
companion
during
his
stay
not
even
santa
cruz
can
compare
with
the
former
reduction
in
the
complacency
of
its
customs
the
indians
of
all
this
region
it
seems
were
as
free
and
natural
in
their
sexual
relations
as
the
ancient
greeks
or
several
other
nations
seeing
no
harm
in
the
indulgence
of
a
natural
appetite
and
while
the
jesuit
fathers
had
a
decided
influence
in
other
matters
they
had
little
in
this
respect
indeed
there
is
evidence
that
the
padres
set
an
example
in
this
regard
quite
at
variance
with
their
preaching
in
san
josé
i
discovered
that
konanz
could
not
speak
his
mother
tongue
we
had
called
on
the
manager
of
one
of
the
two
belgian
houses
for
information
in
the
matter
of
homestead
colonists
in
the
region
and
at
every
few
words
my
companion
spilled
over
into
his
a
dozen
times
i
had
to
remind
him
that
the
manager
did
not
understand
that
tongue
here
was
exactly
the
type
of
immigrant
bolivia
sadly
needs
a
man
prepared
to
spend
his
life
in
the
country
capable
of
sustained
toil
and
likely
to
leave
strong
children
behind
him
yet
already
the
politicians
of
la
paz
had
given
three
large
syndicates
title
almost
for
nothing
to
all
the
fertile
portions
of
this
immense
territory
and
these
held
it
shut
against
settlers
who
did
not
accept
their
terms
which
as
i
heard
them
outlined
to
konanz
virtually
made
them
vassals
to
the
companies
instead
of
assisting
a
far
off
here
in
the
wilderness
the
manager
used
all
his
suave
persuasiveness
to
get
my
companion
s
name
signed
to
a
contract
of
benefit
only
to
his
own
belgian
house
and
would
in
all
probability
have
succeeded
had
i
not
been
there
with
counteracting
advice
in
english
these
houses
are
more
jesuitical
than
their
predecessors
in
exploiting
the
and
their
own
employees
a
former
one
has
added
on
reading
my
notes
the
bribery
of
government
officials
to
obtain
immense
concessions
of
land
which
they
make
no
effort
to
develop
is
a
mere
detail
of
their
business
methods
they
sell
at
from
to
percent
increase
over
buying
prices
even
of
puerto
suarez
a
german
imitation
of
a
american
plow
was
held
at
bolivianos
a
roll
of
barbed
wire
at
bls
ordinary
shoes
as
much
a
can
of
kerosene
bls
not
merely
do
the
germans
take
advantage
of
their
virtual
monopoly
to
buy
of
the
natives
at
a
fifth
of
the
just
value
and
sell
again
at
five
times
that
but
even
their
dealings
with
each
other
are
unprincipled
one
episode
will
stand
as
typical
a
bank
failed
in
la
paz
the
government
seeing
all
the
germans
as
brothers
notified
one
of
the
firms
that
the
bills
issued
by
that
bank
had
become
worthless
expecting
one
house
to
warn
the
other
instead
the
manager
gathered
together
all
the
worthless
in
his
possession
and
sent
them
one
at
a
time
by
natives
to
the
rival
house
with
orders
to
make
some
small
purchase
and
bring
back
the
change
in
good
money
barter
is
the
chief
form
of
commerce
in
all
this
region
we
chanced
to
be
chattering
with
the
manager
of
a
belgian
house
in
san
josé
when
the
old
cura
came
in
with
a
long
document
written
on
the
firm
s
stationery
it
proved
to
be
the
certificate
of
baptism
of
a
daughter
recently
born
to
the
manager
whose
housekeeper
had
insisted
on
this
formality
after
much
chaffering
the
priest
was
at
last
beaten
down
to
three
bolivianos
for
his
divine
services
caramba
cried
the
german
in
pretended
anger
if
you
re
going
to
mulct
me
this
way
every
time
i
ll
discharge
my
housekeeper
and
bring
you
no
more
to
baptise
and
what
are
you
going
to
take
for
those
three
billetes
he
went
on
the
priest
ran
his
dull
eyes
around
the
shelves
packed
with
all
manner
of
cheap
imports
until
they
fell
upon
a
long
array
of
bottles
then
he
glanced
back
at
the
manager
who
was
at
that
moment
offering
him
a
cigarette
pues
señor
mumbled
the
old
ecclesiastic
as
he
accepted
a
light
i
wonder
if
you
have
a
real
good
wine
proper
to
say
mass
cómo
no
cried
the
german
in
his
throaty
but
spanish
there
is
a
splendid
wine
just
the
thing
for
mass
worth
five
bolivianos
even
in
europe
but
a
wink
at
konanz
and
myself
to
you
as
my
compadre
as
well
as

i
ll
make
it

accepted
the
exchange
and
wandered
back
to
the
monastery
with
the
bottle
under
his
arm
to
judge
from
the
condition
he
was
in
when
we
returned
to
our
lodging
he
said
at
least
a
masses
that
very
evening
we
were
lolling
luxuriously
in
our
hammocks
one
morning
when
a
man
in
a
straw
hat
cotton
jacket
and
trousers
a
long
lack
of
shave
and
feet
that
had
never
known
the
restraint
of
shoes
wandered
into
the
compound
and
asked
konanz
if
he
spoke
english
the
latter
full
of
the
of
his
race
had
already
misinformed
the
newcomer
in
the
affirmative
when
i
drew
his
attention
there
was
not
a
hair
of
the
man
s
head
that
did
not
cry
native
yet
he
spoke
my
own
tongue
rapidly
with
only
the
intangible
hint
of
a
foreign
accent
where
did
you
learn
english
i
yawned
why
i
am
an
american
came
the
startling
answer
my
name
is
jim
powell
we
was
born
in
texas
he
went
on
without
urging
i
don
t
remember
what
place
an
when
i
was
small
paw
an
maw
they
went
away
with
five
of
us
children
because
north
america
was
fixin
to
fight
i
don
t
know
what
country
they
was
aimin
to
fight
but
paw
he
didn
t
want
to
n
so
we
sailed
across
the
ocean
to
bolivia
the
other
seven
children
was
born
in
chiquitos
an
finally
paw
he
up
an
died
last
year
maw
she
s
livin
out
to
san
antonio
an
the
rest
is
mostly
scattered
around
one
of
the
girl
s
married
to
a
judge
in
santa
cruz
an
the
others
is
on
the
his
language
was
that
of
the
white
trash
of
our
southern
states
but
was
academic
compared
to
the
illiterate
brogue
of
his
brother
hughtie
who
arrived
soon
after
him
the
latter
had
come
to
bolivia
so
young
that
spanish
and
chiquitana
were
his
native
tongues
he
was
a
for
a
native
owning
several
carts
and
had
recently
been
released
from
eight
months
in
the
prison
of
santa
cruz
at
the
cost
of
all
he
owned
jes
becoze
i
killed
a
feller
thet
was
monkeyin
with
one
o
my
accustomed
as
we
are
to
transplanted
foreigners
of
all
nationalities
in
our
own
country
it
was
a
distinct
shock
to
come
upon
a
bolivianized
american
such
atavism
brought
the
reflection
that
civilization
is
at
best
a
weak
and
artificial
thing
so
completely
native
had
the
pair
become
that
the
natives
themselves
never
thought
of
them
as
foreigners
hughtie
was
soon
to
leave
for
the
paraguay
river
with
a
train
of
carts
and
invited
us
to
go
along
pretending
native
fashion
that
he
was
in
charge
of
the
expedition
of
which
in
reality
he
was
a
mere
peon
when
the
time
set
came
he
wandered
into
the
monastery
to
say
that
we
should
start
the
following
if
thet
there
mozo
finds
thet
there
bull
that
run
away
or
if
not
then
the
next
night
hughtie
was
a
true
bolivian
in
putting
his
trust
chiefly
in
the
shadow
across
the
jesuit
was
exactly
horizontal
when
refreshed
by
four
long
gnatless
days
and
nights
in
san
josé
we
pushed
on
along
a
road
that
stretched
like
a
tunnel
through
the
greenery
konanz
had
decided
to
travel
a
few
days
further
eastward
the
road
was
of
sand
that
drunk
up
the
rains
quickly
but
thirst
was
correspondingly
worse
jejenes
were
fewer
though
swarms
of
swamp
flies
added
their
annoyance
the
danger
of
savages
was
less
than
in
the
monte
grande
on
the
other
hand
tigers
as
the
natives
call
the
jaguar
were
said
to
be
plentiful
the
mosquitero
protected
us
from
these
however
were
any
protection
needed
even
when
sleeping
in
the
wilderness
for
the
animal
is
never
known
to
attack
unless
it
can
see
the
head
of
its
victim
we
were
soon
splashing
again
through
swamps
and
often
wading
as
laboriously
through
deep
sand
between
them
beyond
the
hamlet
of
dolores
where
we
saw
our
first
wild
ostriches
the
country
grew
more
open
with
scrub
trees
the
way
strewn
with
appetizing
or
land
turtles
the
hollow
charred
shells
of
which
marked
more
than
one
of
former
travelers
we
should
have
reached
the
ranch
of
an
american
off
the
main
trail
on
the
second
day
had
not
the
german
given
out
at
las
taperas
a
cluster
of
three
huts
at
the
forking
of
the
ways
we
camped
under
a
heavily
loaded
lemon
tree
beside
a
swampy
lake
backed
far
off
by
a
blue
range
of
low
hills
from
this
flowed
a
clear
little
stream
in
which
i
lay
most
of
the
afternoon
with
only
my
nose
and
hands
out
of
water
and
finished
the
volume
of
nietzsche
to
the
disgust
of
the
german
who
did
not
believe
in
vashing
all
over
der
in
the
morning
we
struck
off
by
the
faint
trail
around
the
lake
the
day
was
brilliant
and
the
going
pleasant
enough
to
be
enjoyed
amid
my
own
meditations
i
let
the
german
and
his
animal
draw
on
ahead
until
they
were
lost
to
view
in
the
placid
chiquitano
landscape
at
las
taperas
we
had
bought
for
twenty
cents
a
whole
bunch
of
the
fat
little
silky
bananas
of
the
region
and
hung
them
on
the
pack
as
i
plodded
on
through
a
low
scrub
forest
and
a
tough
and
wiry
grass
hunger
gradually
intruded
upon
my
dreams
and
almost
at
the
instant
it
grew
tangible
a
fresh
banana
appeared
in
the
trail
before
me
after
that
they
were
as
nicely
proportioned
to
my
requirements
as
manna
to
the
israelites
in
a
not
wholly
dissimilar
wilderness
but
what
had
become
of
konanz
hour
after
hour
passed
without
a
sign
of
him
he
was
not
accustomed
to
lead
the
way
for
so
prolonged
a
period
i
pushed
on
more
rapidly
not
entirely
free
from
visions
of
savages
falling
upon
him
the
sun
stood
high
overhead
casting
down
its
rays
like
the
contents
of
an
overturned
when
i
caught
sight
of
him
at
last
some
distance
beyond
he
lay
panting
and
dripping
in
the
scant
shade
of
a
bush
while
the
mule
stood
tied
to
another
eyeing
him
suspiciously
it
was
a
full
minute
before
he
gathered
breath
to
relieve
my
anxiety
oh
you
mool
he
gasped
shaking
his
fist
at
the
animal
so
savagely
that
it
all
but
tore
itself
loose
rhight
avay
now
i
shoot
you
der
head
through
you
expurgated
of
its
adjectives
the
story
during
which
i
was
forced
to
retain
a
deep
solemnity
was
that
the
mule
having
been
beaten
and
kicked
during
all
the
loading
that
suddenly
taken
fright
when
the
german
started
up
from
a
log
on
which
he
had
rested
for
a
moment
and
had
run
away
for
hours
the
angry
teuton
had
pursued
the
animal
trailing
her
by
the
clue
of
bananas
she
had
dropped
at
intervals
for
my
benefit
until
no
doubt
frightened
to
find
herself
alone
in
the
wilderness
she
come

the
pampa
gave
place
to
dense
tangled
growth
not
tall
enough
to
shade
us
from
the
blazing
afternoon
sun
yet
high
enough
to
cut
us
off
in
the
trail
from
every
breath
of
breeze
until
our
tongues
and
throats
went
parched
and
and
the
sand
sifted
in
through
the
holes
in
my
shoes
and
burned
my
toes
konanz
could
only
be
coaxed
along
a
mile
at
a
time
between
which
he
lay
like
a
log
in
any
patch
of
shade
to
be
found
luckily
the
sun
was
still
above
the
horizon
when
the
endless
jungle
was
enlivened
by
the
welcome
sight
of
a
thatched
house
framed
in
corn
and
banana
fields
and
backed
by
slight
wooded
ridges
about
the
gate
toward
which
we
tore
our
way
through
jungle
grass
were
toiling
three
men
in
hair
and
beards
barefoot
in
their
leather
and
wearing
the
customary
chiquitano
garb
of
two
thin
and
faded
garments
topped
by
hats
of
local
weave

on

astonishment
all

turned
out
to
be
americans
henry
halsey
whose
welcome
was
as
genuine
as
any
i
received
in
south
america
though
less
expressed
in
words
than
deeds
was
owner
of
this
wilderness
estate
his
employees
were
chris
and
george
powell
younger
brothers
of
the
pair
we
had
met
in
san
josé
halsey
was
a
virginian
whose
career
had
ranged
from
teaching
country
school
to
mining
in
zaruma
and
cerro
de
pasco
the
altitude
bothered
him
and
he
had
drifted
to
paraguay
only
to
find
too
much
government
and
to
push
on
into
this
wilderness
as
far
from
the
world
as
a
man
can
easily
get
not
because
the
government
of
bolivia
is
an
improvement
on
that
of
paraguay
but
because
its
tentacles
rarely
reach
so
far
into
the
wilds
he
had
prospered
he
had
all
but
come
to
grief
at
the
outset
however
barely
had
he
chosen
a
knoll
on
which
to
build
his
hut
when
he
was
bitten
by
a
small
viper
that
swelled
one
leg
to
thrice
its
natural
size
and
left
him
half
paralyzed
for
four
days
he
could
not
move
from
where
he
lay
and
only
by
good
fortune
had
he
water
within
reach
for
no
other
human
being
appeared
until
long
after
his
recovery
now
with
a
native
wife
and
child
as
well
as
his
peons
he
was
in
no
danger
of
repeating
the
experience
with
american
energy
he
had
cleared
of
the
primeval
tropical
forest
a
large
space
that
now
waved
with
and
with
bananas
and
productive
and
had
built
a
large
house
in
the
native
style
and
a
distillery
to
turn
his
into
value
while
his
cattle
spread
over
a
broad
region
in
which
he
had
no
neighbor
to
dispute
his
sway
his
chief
problem
was
to
get
peons
for
as
often
as
a
native
was
named
subprefect
of
the
district
he
rounded
up
all
the
laborers
for
many
miles
around
and
forced
them
to
work
on
his
own
estate
thus
halsey
was
reduced
to
the
intermittent
assistance
of
chris
and
george
these
sons
of
the
texan
who
didn
t
aim
to
fight
were
as
truly
peons
as
the
lowest
of
the
natives
they
were
subject
to
the
same
slavery
that
prevails
in
all
the
region
hiring
themselves
out
for
an
advance
and
getting
ever
more
deeply
into
debt
to
their
employer
chris
was
just
then
working
out
a
rifle
and
his
brother
a
they
had
all
the
diffidence
of
the
native
peon
the
same
point
of
view
the
same
loose
habits
spoke
english
only
when
forced
to
lamely
and
without
ending
every
sentence
with
an
appealing
ain
t
thet
right
maw
to
their
mother
the
latter
was
strikingly
typical
of
the
erosion
of
customs
a
poor
white
of
our
south
grafted
upon
the
life
of
tropical
bolivia
completely
illiterate
barefoot
bedraggled
as
any
native
woman
whom
she
went
one
better
by
incessantly
chewing
tobacco
she
had
wholly
succumbed
to
her
environment
and
spoke
fluently
one
of
the
most
atrocious
imitations
of
spanish
it
has
ever
been
my
fortune
to
hear
in
a
long
experience
with
all
grades
of
that
tongue
here
we
made
up
royally
for
all
the
hungry
days
behind
us
the
products
of
halsey
s
exotic
industry
ranged
all
the
way
from
fowls
to
bowls
of
real
milk
unboiled
unspoiled
in
any
only
bread
which
could
not
be
had
in
these
wilds
at
a
dollar
a
nibble
its
rôle
was
filled
by
cold
boiled
squash
or
plantains
fried
in
lard
the
craving
for
sweets
i
found
was
no
personal
weakness
halsey
ate
huge
quantities
of
he
refined
by
the
primitive
method
of
covering
it
with
a
layer
of
it
on
every
possible
dish
and
often
munching
it
like
candy
the
longing
for
fats
or
grease
commonly
supposed
to
be
chiefly
confined
to
the
arctic
regions
was
also
extraordinary
in
this
climate
so
great
was
the
demand
for
lard
that
it
sold
at
cents
a
pound
the
supplied
by
the
owners
of
was
mixed
with
soap
to
prevent
the
peon
drivers
from
eating
it
among
the
children
of
the
region
due
to
some
morbid
condition
of
the
stomach
is
almost
universal
frequently
resulting
in
death
unless
the
vigilance
of
parents
is
constant
the
majority
are
chalky
white
weak
and
sickly
with
enormous
protruding
bellies
one
of
halsey
s
sources
of
income
was
the
carting
of
salt
from
the
shallow
lakes
some
days
to
the
south
around
the
shores
of
which
it
gathers
in
large
quantities
to
the
neighboring
hamlet
of
san
juan
where
it
sold
at
bolivianos
a
the
region
was
well
stocked
with
deer
wild
cattle
belonged
to
whoever
shot
them
jaguars
were
not
hard
to
find
and
were
so
numerous
that
he
shot
at
least
one
a
week
to
feed
his
hogs
this
stout
bulky
animal
largest
of
the
south
american
fauna
known
to
us
as
the
tapir
lives
in
the
dense
thickets
near
streams
or
in
which
it
bathes
by
moonlight
or
in
the
gray
of
dawn
the
experienced
hunter
has
little
difficulty
in
waylaying
the
anta
since
it
always
follows
the
same
path
to
and
from
the
water
the
bolivian
variety
is
about
the
size
of
a
yearling
calf
with
short
legs
and
a
long
flexible
porcine
snout
its
skin
excellent
for
the
making
of
harness
is
so
tough
that
it
dashes
with
impunity
through
the
densest
spiny
thickets
often
tearing
from
its
back
by
this
means
its
chief
enemy
the
jaguar
caught
young
the
anta
becomes
as
tame
as
a
puppy
following
its
master
with
marked
devotion
four
days
i
swung
my
hammock
under
a
great
tree
before
halsey
s
door
reading
belated
magazines
of
the
order
the
neurotic
artificiality
of
which
seemed
particularly
ridiculous
against
this
background
of
primitive
nature
as
the
complexity
of
life
in
great
cities
stood
out
by
contrast
to
the
simple
ways
of
the
region
lounging
in
the
tropical
shade
it
was
easy
to
understand
why
men
so
often
settle
down
in
the
tropics
and
let
the
world
drift
on
without
them
easy
to
lose
the
feeling
that
life
is
short
and
fleeting
that
one
will
be
a
long
time
dead
and
must
grasp
existence
as
it
passes
the
day
after
our
arrival
konanz
had
fallen
victim
to
chills
and
fever
my
regret
was
tempered
by
the
memory
of
many
a
vain
struggle
to
get
him
to
take
a
daily
dose
of
quinine
when
he
recovered
which
did
not
promise
to
be
soon
he
planned
to
explore
the
region
round
about
for
a
spot
on
which
to
settle
i
took
leave
of
my
on
one
of
the
last
mornings
of
january
and
struck
off
alone
that
day
s
experience
emphasized
the
difference
between
trackless
jungle
and
even
the
poorest
of
roads
some
twelve
miles
separated
halsey
s
estate
from
the
traveled
trail
the
faint
path
through
wiry
grasses
and
low
brush
which
he
had
pointed
out
to
me
died
out
even
sooner
than
i
had
feared
i
pushed
on
in
the
direction
i
knew
i
must
go
and
a
shade
east
a
wooded
bluff
standing
above
the
jungle
landscape
like
the
irish
coast
from
the
sea
gave
an
objective
point
it
was
on
the
summit
of
this
that
thompson
and
his
had
planted
in
vain
their
gold
in
just
such
jungle
as
that
about
me
they
had
wandered
starved
and
choking
for
days
somewhere
in
this
sea
of
vegetation
lay
the
and
bones
of
the
more
fortunate
of
the
pair
to
keep
a
due
course
in
the
trackless
wilderness
is
not
so
easy
as
to
set
it
i
was
soon
among
heavier
undergrowth
that
cut
down
my
progress
like
a
head
wind
that
of
a
windjammer
then
in
jungle
that
made
every
step
a
struggle
then
in
full
forest
with
the
densest
undergrowth
snatching
clinging
tearing
at
me
for
all
the
world
like
living
beings
determined
to
stop
my
advance
at
any
cost
vines
enwrapped
me
head
chest
waist
and
feet
at
every
step
thorns
and
brambles
gashed
and
tore
my
clothing
leaves
of
wild
pineapple
laid
bare
my
bleeding
knees
the
jungle
reached
forth
and
snatched
a
sleeve
from
my
shirt
slashed
my
hands
broke
my
bootlaces
poured
blinding
sweat
into
my
eyes
and
treacherously
tripped
me
up
so
that
i
smashed
headlong
into
masses
of
vegetation
where
who
knew
what
might
be
sleeping
or
lurking
the
scent
of
wild
animals
was
pungent
now
and
then
i
fell
into
their
recent
lairs
or
signs
of
their
passing
every
plunge
left
me
so
breathless
from
the
incessant
struggle
that
i
was
several
minutes
gathering
strength
to
crawl
to
my
feet
and
tear
my
way
onward
all
day
i
fought
nature
hand
to
hand
with
the
growing
conviction
that
i
should
still
be
struggling
when
night
came
upon
me
the
sun
beat
pitilessly
down
into
the
breathless
tangle
once
when
thirst
seemed
no
longer
endurable
i
had
broken
out
upon
a
small
swamp
and
thrown
myself
to
drink
it
half
dry
from
it
radiated
the
paths
of
wild
animals
and
every
inch
of
the
wet
sand
was
marked
with
their
footprints
as
fresh
as
if
they
had
that
moment
passed
i
recognized
those
of
the
deer
the
anta
the
jaguar
and
those
of
at
least
a
score
of
smaller
species
were
plainly
visible
beyond
the
swamp
the
waterless
jungle
was
even
thicker
the
blue
headland
of
ypias
had
long
since
been
lost
to
view
and
i
found
that
i
was
indeed
going
round
in
a
circle
like
the
heroes
of
fiction
until
i
drew
out
my
compass
and
insisted
that
nature
let
me
through
the
way
it
indicated
hunger
was
completely
routed
by
a
thirst
like
a
raging
furnace
within
me
frequently
i
brought
up
against
thickets
so
dense
that
further
progress
seemed
impossible
and
must
tear
my
way
back
and
forth
as
along
some
fortress
wall
seeking
a
weak
spot
in
the
impregnable
density
then
all
at
once
toward
sunset
when
i
had
concluded
i
was
hopelessly
lost
i
fell
suddenly
out
of
the
jungle
into
a
sandy
road
fell
indeed
on
hands
and
knees
for
the
way
was
worn
several
feet
deep
into
the
soft
soil
an
hour
along
it
brought
me
to
the
of
ypias
uninhabited
yet
like
all
these
rare
natural
clearings
on
the
route
so
important
as
to
have
its
name
solemnly
engraved
on
the
map
of
the
republic
this
was
the
scene
of
what
thompson
had
called

in

bit
of

jungle

the
six
wooden
crosses
of
the

carved

the
names
of
all

the
german
confederate

its
at
a
sharp
angle

natives
of
the
region
apparently
resenting
his
claim
to
full
christian
burial
beyond
the
clear
little
stream
that
makes
ypias
a
favorite
four
were
preparing
for
the
customary
night
journey
after
a
day
of
rest
and
grazing
one
of
the
barefoot
drivers
under
command
of
a
cholo
astride
a
proved
to
be
hughtie
powell
i
climbed
into
his
wagon
and
stretched
out
on
the
great
balls
of
rubber
from
the

with
which
it
was
loaded

selling

of

each
cart
was
drawn
by
twenty
oxen
gaunt
reddish
animals
that
seemed
patience
done
in
flesh
and
bone
their
pace
averaged
perhaps
two
miles
an
hour
now
and
then
hughtie
like
the
other
drivers
sprang
noiselessly
into
the
sand
and
racing
ahead
lashed
each
yoke
in
turn
with
insulting
words
of
encouragement
and
the
entire
team
crowded
into
one
of
the
jungle
walls
until
the
massive
cart
was
dragged
over
small
trees
and
bushes
at
a
slight
acceleration
of
pace
a
dozen
strange
cries
were
used
in
urging
the
phlegmatic
animals
forward
when
a
halt
was
ordered
the
drivers
sprang
to
the
ground
and
ran
alongside
them
voicing
a
long
soothing
wail
of
peculiarly
mournful
that
often
lasted
a
full
minute
once
in
the
thick
black
night
the
train
halted
to
boil
rice
and
make
tea
of
a
jungle
leaf
then
dragged
drowsily
on
at
daylight
we
broke
out
into
the
pascana
of
motococito
where
the
animals
were
turned
loose
to
graze
for
the
day
each
pair
still
yoked
together
by
a
beam
that
was
almost
a
log
fastened
across
the
front
of
their
horns
with
rawhide
thongs
while
the
peons
swung
their
hammocks
under
an

thatched
roof

we
had
made
four
leagues
or
a

twelve
miles
during
the
night
i
made
my

to
the
home

nearby
for
no
traveler
across
bolivia
misses
the
opportunity
of
at
least
one
meal
with
this
of
bolivians
outwardly
ugly
he
was
a
man
of
fascinating
personality
before
whom
one
could
sit
for
hours
listening
to
anecdotes
frequently
emphasized
in
his
excitement
by
the
snapping
of
his
long
forefinger
and
marveling
at
the
grasp
of
mind
of
a
man
who
has
never
emerged
from
this
inland
wilderness
so
great
was
his
magnetism
that
he
had
imposed
on
all
those
about
him
a
degree
of
human
kindness
and
common
decency
rare
in
the
region
the
education
of
this
corner
of
the
republic
wholly
neglected
by
the
government
he
had
taken
upon
himself
had
turned
one
of
his
thatched
buildings
into
a
school
for
the
children
of

motococito
is
frequently
favored
with
attacks
by
the
wild
indians
and
not
the
least
dramatic
of
don
cupertino
s
stories
was
that
of
the
routing
of
a
band
of
los
bárbaros
the
night
before
the
pace
of
the
was
so
slow
that
i
pushed
on
alone
the
sky
was
incessantly
growling
off
to
the
southwest
banks
of
clouds
frequently
wiped
out
the
brilliant
sun
and
many
a
roaring
tropical
deluge
set
me
slipping
and
sliding
at
every
step
swamps
of
varying
length
and
depth
continued
monotonously
to
intrude
until
i
became
amphibious
with
water
almost
my
natural
element
where
the
road
forked
one
afternoon
i
took
the
fainter
trail
for
a
to
the
town
of
santiago
de
chiquitos
the
rumor
was
persistent
that
americanos
lived
there
moreover
it
was
said
to
be
situated
on
a
ridge
unknown
to
insects
the
heights
to
be
surmounted
were
not
piled
into
the
sky
ahead
as
in
the
andes
i
knew
i
was
rising
only
by
the
changing
character
of
soil
and
woods
the
former
increasing
in
rocky
sandstone
formations
the
latter
more
open
with
diminishing
undergrowth
after
the
first
few
miles
up
the
forest
opened
out
now
and
then
on
little
grassy
pampas
with
gaps
in
the
wooded
hills
through
which
one
could
look
back
upon
tropical
bolivia
spreading
away
humid
blue
to
infinity
in
every
direction
with
a
vast
sense
of
relief
after
weeks
of
never
seeing
the
woods
for
the
trees
that
had
shut
me
in
the
trail
split
at
last
into
several
branches
the
one
i
took
at
random
led
me
to
a
thatched
hut
then
suddenly
broke
out
upon
the
grassy
plaza
of
a
great
or
a
tiny
town
according
to
the
point
of
view
and
the
immediate
previous
experience
a
native
lolling
in
a
hammock
answered
my
question
with
a
sí
hay
in
the
impersonal
monotone
common
to
the
tropics
languidly
nodding
toward
one
of
the
huts
facing
the
plaza
and
all
but
shoeless
my
reddened
knees
protruding
through
the
remnant
of
my
breeches
my
shirt
lacking
a
sleeve
and
otherwise
mutilated
beyond
recognition
unkempt
and
showing
many
a
patch
of
my
hide
my
face
bristling
with
four
razorless
weeks
unquestionably
the
most
disreputable
sight
in
all
that
disreputable
region
a
hunger
like
the
old
man
of
the
sea
riding
my
shoulders
i
strode
across
to
the
building
indicated
and
paused
in
the
doorway
inside
seated
about
a
table
backed
by
a
butler
of
african
dignity
sat
five
gringos
in
speckless
white
dipping
their
soup
noiselessly
and
without
haste
with
a
calm
backward
motion
santiago

that
died
for

were
countless
the

in

evidence

were

to
read
by
even
at
night
and
books
to
read
by
them
when
the
sun
touched
the
jungle

the
west
los
americanos
strolled
homeward
from
the
office
pausing
to
play
ball
until
dark
with
real
gloves
but
picking
green
oranges
from
the
plaza
trees
as
often
as
they
needed
a
new
great
bands
of
parrakeets
flew
by
high
overhead
screaming
and
gossiping
deafeningly
but
with
no
suggestion
of
stopping
in
a
place
so
high
and
cold
from
this
mountain
top
the
sunsets
across
the
flat
jungle
were
indescribable
particularly
after
a
rainy
day
the
enormous
conflagrations
blazed
for
a
brief
time
across
all
the
western
world
faded
to
red
to
pink
then
into
the
of
a
tropical
evening
the
distant
hills
turned
from
deep
blue
to
purple
banks
of
white
clouds
floating
up
out
of
the
wilderness
below
the
sky
above
faded
through
all
the
shades
of
pink
to
lilac
and
to
purple
until
even
the
flecks
of
clouds
tinged
with
the
last
reflected
rays
were
wiped
out
entirely
at
night
looking
south
we
could
see
the
fires
of
the
wild
indians
of
the
gran
chaco
besides
the
there
were
the
managers
of
two
belgian
only
stores
for
some
hundred
miles
around
mere
thatched
huts
like
the
rest
with
no
distinguishing
odd
german
or
two
an
argentino
who
wore
shoes
and
the
rest
were
barefoot
natives

for
an
occasional
passerby
like
san

santiago
de

set
almost
exactly
in
the
geographical
center
of
south
america
was
a
reduction
of
the
jesuits
with
more
than
inhabitants
at
the
time
of
their
expulsion
it
is
a
sleepy
little
hamlet
of
some
two
streets
of
huts
among
gentle
and
hills
with
a
constant
breeze
and
no
insects
lolling
through
an
easy
barefoot
existence
chiefly
in
hammocks
coffee
bushes
fill
every
back
yard
the
coffee
of
santiago
being
famous
through
all
chiquitos
a
languid
commerce
in
cattle
sugar
and
alcohol
is
carried
on
intermittently
the
region
round
about
is
rich
in
timber
high
above
all
else
a
wonderfully
beautiful
stands
out
against
the
cerulean
sky
the
inhabitants
retain
many
of
the
customs
bequeathed
them
by
the
jesuits
only
a
wooden
church
was
built
here
with
four
bells
in
a
wooden
tower
on
legs
some
distance
from
the
main
building
into
this
an
indian
climbs
several
times
a
day
and
more
often
by
night
to
make
life
hideous
why
the
loyalists
were
so
fond
of
the
continual
hammering
of
these
instruments
of
torture
was
a
mystery
to
me
at
the
time
but
in
the
library
of
asunción
i
ran
across
an
old
volume
that
explained
the
matter
the
writer
a
european
member
of
the
brotherhood
visiting
a
reduction
asked
the
superior
why
the
padres
saw
fit
to
keep
themselves
awake
most
of
the
night
for
no
apparent
reason
the
jesuit
answered
brother
we
keep
our
faithful
flock
toiling
all
day
in
the
fields
after
the
evening
meal
they
drop
at
once
to
sleep
without
remembering
their
marital
duties
their
first
fatigue
worn
off
we
remind
them
of
those
duties
now
and
then
during
the
night
waking
them
up
with
the
noise
of
drums
and
bells
to
the
end
that
the
succeeding
generation
may
be
larger
to
the
glorification
of
the
sacred
church
and
our
holy
and
to
think
that
i
had
fancied
the
jangling
of
all
down
the
length
of
the
andes
to
be
a
mere
caprice
of
the
holy
fathers
the
fiestas
of
jesuit
days
are
religiously
preserved
several
nights
we
were
kept
awake
by
the
monotonous
heathenish
beating
of
a
drum
often
accompanied
by
a
shrill
fife
by
day
to
the
music
of
these
most
of
the
population
marched
round
and
round
the
town
holding
hands
and
swinging
them
high
before
and
behind
them
in
a
kind
of
shuffle
and
whirl
on
their
bare
feet
in
the
silent
sand
streets
getting
ever
drunker
on
chicha
of
maize
or
the
stronger
they
danced
also
the
to
the
accompaniment
of
the
a
hollow
calabash
with
seeds
inside
it
there
was
no
resident
priest
but
an
old
indian
who
had
assisted
the
former
cura
conducted
a
service
each
sunday
always
ending
it
with
a
debauch
that
hung
over
into
the
middle
of
the
week
there
is
one
custom
however
which
even
the
jesuits
could
not
bequeath
them
of
industry
in
the
olden
days
the
entire
population
was
sent
to
work
each
morning
with
drums
prayers
and
processions
only
the
processions
prayers
and
drums
remain
as
in
all
chiquitos
the
women
and
girls
of
santiago
chiefly
indian
in
blood
with
now
and
then
a
trace
of
the
negro
solidly
built
as
an
wear
only
the
loose
their
customs
are
if
possible
even
more
than
those
of
san
josé
yet
they
are
by
no
means
forward
being
rather
bashful
indeed
with
little
sense
of
and
are
said
to
yield
more
easily
to
blandishments
and
trinkets
than
to
money
the
former
priest
demanded
fabulous
sums
for
his
services
which
is
no
doubt
one
of
several
reasons
why
virtually
none
even
of
the
best
families
are
married
the
moral
attitude
of
the
place
may
most
easily
be
gaged
by
an
episode
that
occurred
during
my
stay
a
shoemaker
living
in
the
other
half
of
the
thatched
hut
occupied
by
los
americanos
learned
that
the
young
woman
who
passed
as
his
wife
had
yielded
to
the
entreaties
of
one
of
the
foreigners
he
beat
the
girl
until
her
cries
could
be
heard
in
the
office
across
the
broad
plaza
but
when
next
day
he
met
the
offending
american
he
bowed
respectfully
with
a
polite

the
reality
on
canvas
would
be
accused
of
gross
exaggeration
a
strip
of
delicate
pink
sky
blended
quickly
into
the
of
the
endless
jungle
darkness
settled
quickly
down
and
we
rode
noiselessly
on
the
sky
an
immense
field
of
stars
bats
circling
around
our
heads
and
alighting
again
and
again
in
the
sandy
road
ahead
to
spring
up
with
a
peculiar
little
squeak
when
the
mule
s
hoofs
had
all
but
touched
them
no
other
sound
was
heard
except
the
chirping
of
the
jungle
chiefly
the
creak
and
short
staccato
of
two
species
of
crickets
and
occasionally
the
noise
of
some
wild
animal
fleeing
unseen
at
our
approach
on
such
a
night
we
came
to
the
tucabaca
the
only
river
of
size
between
the
guapay
and
the
paraguay
i
ordered
a
halt
until
the
moon
appeared
but
clouds
hid
it
and
we
came
perilously
near
losing
a
mule
in
forcing
the
frightened
animals
across
frequently
the
tucabaca
rises
in
a
few
hours
to
a
raging
torrent
that
can
only
be
crossed
in
a
or
in
the
dugout
of
a
surly
old
brazilian
negro
living
in
a
cluster
of
huts
on
the
further
bank
at
santa
ana
eighteen
waterless
miles
beyond
we
were
overtaken
by
two
of
the
gringo
colony
of
santiago
calling
itself
a
city
the
place
is
merely
a
row
of
thatched
huts
around
a
space
with
a
to
keep
it
alive
saintly
in
its
customs
as
all
the
towns
of
this
saintly
route
its
corregidor
takes
orders
not
from
the
subprefect
of
san

but
from

sent
out
from

by

the

the

descend
upon
it
periodically
at
the
very
edge
of
the
hamlet
lies
a
a
three
miles
long
famous
for
its
victims
but
beyond
territory
which
the
year
before
had
been
an
almost
unbroken
lake
was
for
long
stretches
without
water
to
drink
though
we
wallowed
in
more
than
one
swamp
and
slough
near
the
corrals
of
yacuces
in
a
low
humid
region
where
rain
often
falls
we
came
upon
old
and
sagging
heavy
with
parasites
and
creepers
the
line
planned
by
the
government
from
puerto
suarez
to
santa
cruz
had
been
abandoned
some
forty
miles
out
and
now
cut
down
the
poles
and
use
the
wire
to
repair
their
wagons
on
the
last
morning
we
woke
at
two
to
find
the
moon
brilliant
and
pulling
on
our
soggy
garments
pushed
eagerly
forward
on
the
right
the
southern
cross
stood
forth
brightly
whenever
a
fleck
of
cloud
veiled
the
moon
away
in
the
forest
monkeys
wailed
their
everlasting
plaint
great
masses
of
green
vines
covering
irregular
giant
bushes
looked
like
german
castles
in
the
moonlight
the
first
flush
of
day
showed
in
the
opening
ahead
the
shoulders
of
the
advance
horseman
cutting
into
the
paling
sky
and
blotting
out
the
bright
morning
star
then
dawn
came
up
like
thunder
out
of
the
endless
wilderness
and
somehow
it
seemed
wasteful
to
keep
the
moon
burning
after
the
tropical
sunshine
had
flooded
all
the
scene
tall
slender
palms
and
all
possible
forms
of
trees
festooned
and
draped
with
vines
in
fantastic

and

stood
out
against
the

of

quickly
shrunk
under

glare
brown
flicking
their
black
tails
saucily
foraged
about
and
flew
clumsily
like
chickens
with
little
as
we
passed
beyond
the
pascana
of
tacuaral
with
its
myriad
of
slim
palms
the
country
that
should
have
been
flooded
at
this
season
was
utterly

after

we
jogged
on
our
thirsty
animals

in

occasional
hut
with

in
a
tiny
space
shaved
out
of
the
bristling

through
the
heat

ahead
a
wide
street
with
buildings
and
open

backed
far
away
by
low
wooded
ridges
and
the

at

it
was
two

to

dawn
was
just
beginning
to
paint

the

between

across
the

a
backwater
of
the

when
i
descended
to
its
edge
and
by
dint
of
acrobatic
feats
of
equilibrium
managed
a
bath
and
left
behind
in
the
mud
and
slime
like
fallen
heroes
of
many
a
campaign
the
remnants
of
my
tramping
garb
as
i
climbed
the

there
persisted
the
feeling
that
i
had
heartlessly
abandoned
some
faithful
friend

long
standing
the

chugged
more
than
two
hours
across
the

the

of

lone
traveler
from

ferocious

of

was

the
of

to

stopped
at
several
towns
and
now
in

now
in

here
and
there
a
lone
passenger
standing
erect
in
his
boat
was
rowed
out
by
a
pair
of
peons
and
picked
up
as
we
slowed
down
for
a
moment
on
the
second
morning
we
halted
at
the
estate
of
an
irishman
on

the

going
to
inspect
a
jaguar
and
a

in
cages
while
roped
a
steer
and
dragging
it
down
to
the
edge
of

to
spare
themselves
the

of
carrying
the
carcass
slaughtered
in
plain
sight
of
all
what
was
served
as
beefsteak
that
noon
and
evening
now
and
again
we
put
in
at
a
little
paraguayan
town
swarming
with
barefoot
in
faded
khaki
with
a
reputation
for
shooting
on
the
slightest
provocation
old
women
came
on
board
with
bread
watermelons
and
clumsy
native
cigars
scorning
brazilian
money
and
demanding
the
ragged
and
all
but
worthless
bills
of
their

here
a
new

appeared
the

sounding
on
all
sides
the
evening
of
the

day
brought
us
to
villa

one
of
the
six
incorporated
cities
of
paraguay
which
might
easily
be
mistaken
for
a
village
an

a
little
railroad
with
screeching

and
an
electric
lighting

of

had
the

of

kerchief
about
his
neck
the

with

against

and
in

with
a

fringe

for
riders
through
the
thorny
undergrowth
over
this
all
wore
a
wide
leather
belt
with
several
buttoned
pockets
bulging
with
their
probably
not
great
wealth
and
a
big
knife
in
a
leather
scabbard
stuck
in
carelessly
behind
as
if
ever
ready
to
be
drawn
on
the
instant
on
the
morning
of
the
fourth
day
i
was
awakened
by
a
long
blast
of
the
whistle
and
peered
out
of
my
hammock
to
find
the
steamer
anchored
among
extensive
docks
it
was
that
soft
moment
of
dawn
when
the
sun
is
just
trembling
in
below
the
eastern
horizon
the
lower
sky
streaked
with
delicate
colors
the
air
of
that
velvety
texture
known
only
at
such
hours
in
the
tropics
then
the
day
blazed
forth
in
all
its
brilliancy
putting
the
night
breeze
to
ignominious
rout
and
disclosing
a
low
city
its
chief
square
lined
by
buildings
the
largest
of
which
i
recognized
from
photographs
as
paraguay
s
government
palace
one
of
a
score
of
hirsute
boatmen
names
painted
in
gaudy
colors
on
the

of
their

me
ashore
with
a
few
strokes
and
at
the
wooden
steps
of

my
how
much
with
a
what
it
pleases
you
either
the
boatmen
of
asunción
are
unlike
their
tribe
elsewhere
or
my
face
had
lost
that
innocent
childlike
air
of
earlier
days
i
rewarded
his
honesty
with
two
paraguayan
dollars
is
about
eleven
cents
marching
through
my
thrust
my
bundle
toward
a
pompous
cholo
in

my
deerskin
asked

waved
a
hand
with
a

you

yourself
and
i
stepped
ashore
in
asunción
del
paraguay
the
capital
of
the
inland
republic
is
its
only
real
city
claiming
some
eighty
thousand
inhabitants
or
one
tenth
the
present
population
of
a
land
that
once
with
nearly
two
millions
ranked
with
brazil
and
the
argentine
as
the
most
important
of
south
america
thanks
to
revolutions
anarchy
lopez
and
his
french
mistress
and
the
consequent
stagnation
it
is
in
the
far
background
of
modern
progress
it
spreads
over
a
considerable
space
of
what
is
really
rolling
to
one
fresh
from
nearly
two
years
in
the
andes
it
seemed
monotonously
flat
across
the
river
on
a
curve
of
which
it
halts
abruptly
lies
the
trackless
the
abode
of
nomadic
indians
by
day
and
fading
to
purple
under
the
setting
sun
unfortunately
francia
el
supremo
dictator
for
a
third
of
a
century
sought
to
beautify
the
town
by
filling
its
lagoons
straightening
its
jumble
of
tortuous
lanes
and
reducing
it
to
a
featureless
similarity
to
all
other
capitals
of
its
kind
and
size
travelers
of
past
centuries
are
agreed
that
the
chief
charm
of
old
asunción
was
due
to
its
delightful
irregularity
certainly
its
ancient
fascination
is
gone
and
it
is
nothing
but
a
languid
little
capital
of
a
stagnant
country
the
least
interesting
of
any
i
had
seen
in
south
america
the
assertion
that
the
population
of
paraguay
is
wholly
indian
in
blood
is
a
decided
overstatement
in
asunción
one
sees
at
least
as
many
whites
as
in
la
paz
nor
is
it
true
that
there
are
nine
women
to
every
man
true
francia
wiped
out
the
old
spaniards
for
conspiring
against
him
forty
years
ago
in
the
days
of
lopez
the
wars
reduced
the
proportion
to
seventeen
to
one
but
time
and
migrating
males
have
all
but
repaired
these
ravages
though
many
a
man
still
lives
on
the
exertions
of
his
harem
one
of
the
several
women
of
which
is
his
legal
wife
and
the
majority
of
children
born
in
the
country
are
illegitimate
in
general
the
place
has
a
different
atmosphere
a
blasé
air
little
like
the
towns
of
the
andes
among
these
less
simple
people
particularly
the
denizens
of
the
centro
español
where
i
was
put
up
during
my
stay
one
got
the
feeling
that
conventionality
was
not
morality
there
was
something
about
their
suave
manners
that
made
one
feel
that
deep
down
they
were
no
such
sticklers
for
honesty
and
justice
as
for
the
urbanities
of
life
or
would
the
artificiality
of
any
civilized
place
have
struck
a
discordant
note
to
one
coming
suddenly
out
of
a
long
stay
in
the
wilderness
it
is
in
asunción
that
the
traveler
from
the
north
notes
the
first
advance
of
the
immigration
that
is
to
increase
to
swamping
proportions
in
the
argentine
as
he
moves
southward
paraguay
is
making
strenuous
though
not
very
tactful
efforts
to
increase
immigration
under
an
immigration
bureau
in
the
hands
of
a
german
commerce
and
government
are
largely
in
the
hands
of
foreigners
at
least
of
the
second
generation
even
the
president
being
a
swiss
in
blood
and
name
paraguay
s
civilization
is
not
strong
enough
to
absorb
the
newcomers
one
hears
german
italian
or
catalan
almost
as
often
as
the
native
guarani
this
latter
is
the
real
speech
of
the
country
spanish
is
spoken
only
in
the
cities
and
even
there
the
people
use
among
themselves
the
remnants
of
the
aboriginal
tongue
teachers
in
large
villages
often
can
not
speak
castilian
the
few
paraguayan
countrymen
who
know
it
are
afraid
to
use
it
for
fear
their
fellows
will
ridicule
them
for
trying
to
show
off
there
has
been
more
than
one
movement
on
foot
to
make
guarani
the
official
as
well
as
the
actual
language
of
the
country
the
money
of
paraguay
has
fallen
to
low
estate
step
into
a
bank
and
throw
down
an
english
sovereign
and
there
will
be
thrust
upon
you
some
in

bringing
the
peso
down
to
little
more
than
the
value
of
our
nickel
metal
money
is
unknown
the
paper
bills
made
in
london
and

are
in
universal
use
the
smaller
denominations
being
ragged
and
dirty
to
the
point
of
illegibility
and
often
patched
with
scraps
of
newspaper
the
nation

the
device
on
these
tattered
recognizes
this
bill
as
fifty
strong
dollars
which
is
quite
different
from
saying
it
will
be
redeemed
at
that
rate
fares
now
had
been

the

had
found
it
necessary
to
print
its
own
change
in
pieces
let

figure
it
out

at
a
dozen
a

it

not

postage
is
the
cheapest
on
earth
evidently
because
the
rates
had
been
established
and
the
stamps
printed
before
the
money
depreciated
after
the
first
investigation
i
put
off
replenishing
my
wardrobe
until
i
should
reach
buenos
aires
it
was
not
merely
because
the
tailor
showed
me
shoddy
stuff
and
demanded
for
a
suit
of
it
the
local
styles
were
even
more
startling
than
the
price
mentioned
in
so
offhand
a
manner
the
trousers
demanded
by
custom
for
example
be
they
made
by
a
local
tailor
or
imported
from
europe
are
built
up
as
high
as
trousers
could
by
any
stretch
of
the
word
go
then
on
top
of
this
comes
an
enormous
so
wide
that
it
requires
three
buttons
to
fasten
it
clamping
the
garment
up
about
the
armpits
if
only
they
would
use
a
couple
of
inches
more
they
could
button
the
trousers
about
the
neck
fasten
a
collar
on
them
and
dispense
with
the
expense
of
a
shirt
entirely
in
the
olden
days
it
is
said
the
inca
tribes
gave
the
inhabitants
of
this
region
the
name
of
breechless
ones
the
amplitude
of
the
trousers
of
the
countryman
and
the
height
of
those
of
his
city
cousin
suggests
that
they
resent
the
implied
insult
keenly
and
have
resolved
to
leave
no
opportunity
for
its
repetition
somewhere
around
this
uncharted
expanse
of

every

to

a
leather
belt
at

six
inches
wide

combination
of

with

later
the

vary
greatly
the

subjected
to
the
competition
of
the

and

buenos

are
and

local
fares

and
luckily
this
is
in

even
when
turned
into

it

was

speeding

monotonous
vast
plains
of

and
coarse
grass
stretching
away
until
lost
to

here
and
there
broken
by
thick
clumps
of

ever
and
again
we
were
slowed
down
or
halted
by
reddish
cattle
on
the
unfenced
track
the
pampa
was
sprinkled
with
them
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
the
plains
either
are
or
are
fancied
to
be
of
no

are
left
to
grazing

the
languid
natives
swinging
in
their
hammocks
under
their
roofs
in
the
edges
of
the
forest
clumps
raised
a
bit
of
corn
and
tobacco
in

hacked
out
of

and
trusted

for
the
rest

seemed

in

my
companions
told
of
erected
during
a
single
night
in
the
middle
of
dwellings
and
requiring
the
exertions
of
a
band
of
workmen
to
dig
them
out
at
length
we
drew
up
before
the
headquarters
at
charaná
it
being
saturday
evening
the
entire
region
men
women
and
children
proposed
to
ride
into
borja
on
the
to
squander
their
month
s
wages
and
remain
several
days
drunk
the
young
american
superintendent
however
issued
orders
to
the
paraguayan
soldiers
that
had
been
assigned
him
and
though
these
looked
anything
but
fierce
in
their
ragged
khaki
and
bare
feet
the
throng
lost
no
time
in
obeying
their
orders
to
disembark
for
all
their
childlike
demeanor
the
soldiers
of
paraguay
have
a
reputation
for
shooting
on
scant
provocation
we
pushed
on
along
battered
old
rails
through
forest
and
jungle
with
here
and
there
a
bank
of
red
clay
some
ten
miles
to
railhead

squirming
its

around
every
knoll
the
cheap
engines
to
be
employed
requiring
that
there
be
nothing
steeper
than
a
one
percent
grade
advance
gangs
had
hacked
out
a
for
some
distance
beyond
where
the
territory
was
growing
so
and
hilly
that
the
superintendent
was
considering
the
use
of
balloons
to
survey
the
country
back
at
the
main
camp
i
had
my
first
or
paraguayan
the
is
to
the
life
of
paraguay
and
its
adjoining
regions
what
coca
leaves
are
to
the
andes
in
the
the
leaves
and
smaller
branches
of
an
evergreen
bush
not
unlike
the
holly
growing
among
taller

are
spread
on
a
raised
platform
of
poles
smoked
and
dried
forced
through
to
the
earth
floor
beneath
beaten
almost
to
a
powder
with
clubs
and
packed
in
by
sewing
up

which
shrink
until
the

the
gringo
engineers
had
come
to
prefer
this
native
beverage
to
coffee
or
tea
though
they
drank
it
in
cups
with
sugar
and
milk
the
native
way
is
to
put
a
spoonful
of
the
powdered
yerba
in
a
little
gourd
pour
this
full
of
boiling
water
and
suck
the
tea
through
a
brass
or
silver
tube
or
in
the
case
of
the
poorer
people
a
reed
one
spoonful
suffices
for
a
score
of
persons
the
gourd
being
passed
from
one
to
another
of
a
group
each
time
being
refilled
with
water
the
drinker
taking
care
not
to
burn
hands
or
lips
on
gourd
or
tube
to
any
but
a
foreigner
it
would
be
an
insult
to
offer
a
separate
bowl
the
greenish
liquid
was
bitter
in
taste
and
by
no
means
pleasant
but
was
due
in
time
to
become
my
favorite
beverage
as
it
does
with
most
gringos
who
continue
the
use
of
it
everywhere
in
this
region
one
runs
upon
natives
loafing
in
the
shade
a
sometimes
carved
with
fantastic
figures
grasped
in
one
hand
lazily
imbibing
the
liquid
at
regular
intervals
unlike
the
coca
it
has
no
narcotic
effect
it
is
on
the
contrary
beneficial
in
stomachic
ailments
the
of
the
pampas
makes
it
serve
as
bread
and
vegetables
in
his
fixed
diet
of
con
or
beef
roasted
in
the
hide
many
an
attempt
has
been
made
to
introduce
to
the
rest
of
the
world
so
far
unfortunately
in
vain
i
fell
asleep
toward
dawn
on
a
cot
set
out
in
the
breeze
to
the
rattle
of
the
clinking
of
bottles
and
glasses
and
cries
of
one
hundred
dollars
two
hundred
and
fifty
from
the
office
in
which
the
gringo
community
had
gathered
next
evening
a
local
train
set
me
down
in
the
heavy
darkness
at
villa
encarnación
up
to
a
few
months
before
the
for
the
night
of
the
in
name
one
of
the
six
cities
of
paraguay
the
place
was
a
drowsy
barefoot
isolated
cluster
of
buildings
rather
than
a
town
strewn
along
the
side
of
a
red
hill
amid
vegetation
on
the
banks
of
the
paraná
the
southern
boundary
of
paraguay
it
covered
a
considerable
space
of
rolling
grassy
ground
with
wide
paths
of
reddish
sand
where
streets
should
have
been
its
slight
commerce
was
chiefly
in
the
hands
of
germans
it
was
humid
with
the
rainy
season
and
insolent
with
its
big
ragged
garrison
green
parrots
screamed
in
and
out
of
the
the
fruit
of
which
was
green
in
color
even
when
ripe
and
of
rather
acid
taste
across
the
paraná
as
wide
as
the
hudson
posadas
in
the
argentine
lay
banked
up
on
the
sloping
opposite
shore
in
plain
sight
from
any
part
of
the
town
life
is
free
and
easy
in
paraguay
close
to
nature
its
women
in
their
loose
gowns
and
bare
feet
very
erect
from
the
practice
of
carrying
loads
on
their
heads
from
childhood
have
a
childlike
simplicity
as
well
as
an
extremely
graceful
carriage
yet
i
found
this
the
least
interesting
of
south
american
countries
its
old
missions
to
the
ruined
churches
of
which
overgrown
with
creepers
a
ride
of
a
day
or
two
from
the
railroad
at
almost
any
point
brings
one
attract
many
travelers
but
i
had
already
seen
these
and
better
in
tropical
bolivia
with
its
education
at
a
low
ebb
chiefly
in
the
hands
of
priests
to
whom
sacred
history
and
catechisms
are
the
sum
total
of
wisdom
the
present
inhabitants
of
paraguay
leave
the
impression
of
being
incapable
of
much
advancement
the
change
from
this
languid
little
country
to
the
live
one
across
the
river
was
almost
startling
when
the
sun
had
declined
somewhat
a
chugged
across
to
posadas
with
a
score
of
passengers
where
we
landed
without
ceremony
among
a
group
of
argentine
officials
and
courteously
to
those
coming
upon
it
from
the
direction
of
buenos
aires
posadas
may
seem
small
and
backward
in
contrast
with
the
drowsy
little
paraguayan
city
still
in
plain
sight
across
the
paraná
it
is
very
much
alive
the
capital
of
the
territory
of
misiones
that
tongue
of
land
piercing
far
up
between
brazil
and
paraguay
and
taking
its
name
from
the
jesuit
establishments
of
olden
times
it
already
boasts
some
ten
thousand
inhabitants
or
more
than
the
entire
territory
contained
ten
years
ago
in
spite
of
being
tolerably
compact
and
in
the
business
section
the
town
covers
a
vast
amount
of
ground
with
very
wide
streets
and
ample
everywhere
except
in
the
clustered
shacks
of
laborers
along
the
a
single
church
its
old
tower
still
unfinished
rather
protestant
than
catholic
in
appearance
by
reason
of
the
simplicity
of
its
adornments
and
the
existence
of
seats
within
takes
the
place
of
the
score
or
more
that
would
bulk
above
a
town
of
similar
size
in
the
andes
here
were
streets
instead
of
steam
and
machinery
business
activity
and
shoes
parks
with
plenty
of
benches
large
prominent
buildings
as
opening
for
the
new
year
in
this
first
week
in
policemen
of
manly
demeanor
canvas
cots
had
taken
the
place
of
hammocks
boys
were
busy
polishing
brass
before
important
business
houses
the
red
now
adorned
all
government
shields
while
the
most
beautiful
flag
of
south
america
the
argentinian
white
and
flew
at
the
crest
of
many
a
façade
here
a
stranger
could
pass
in
the
streets
without
being
stared
out
of
countenance
the
inhabitants
had
a
look
of
eagerness
and
hope
in
their
faces
signs
of
at
least
a
material
prosperity
in
striking
contrast
to
the
dreary
hopelessness
of
andean
regions
yet
posadas
is
not
forty
years
old
while
encarnación
across
the
river
was
founded
by
the
jesuits
more
than
three
centuries
ago
in
the
car
of
the
the
nord
este
argentino
there
were
no
indian
passengers
and
though
only
a
the
train
made
good
progress
at
the
very
first
farm
outside
posadas
an
american
binder
was
felling
the
autumn
i
had
not
seen
so
much
as
a
mower
since
crossing
the
rio
grande
thirty
months
before
at
every
station
were
uniformed
police
mounted
officers
patroled
the
country
roads
houses
along
the
way
were
not
the
dens
of
human
animals
but
were
supplied
with
the
comforts
of
home
even
american
tucked
away
in
the
shade
of
their
verandas
i
had
come
to
the
end
of
the
great
south
american
and
jungle
and
from
now
on
the
great
argentine
pampas
grew
ever
broader
slightly
rolling
here
stretching
away
to
infinity
on
each
hand
the
soil
of
misiones
was
given
over
to
grazing
rather
than
to
agriculture
though
we
passed
long
the
ears
broken
half
off
and
hanging
over
to
ripen
cattle
were
everywhere
and
were
roping
them
here
and
there
while
careered
across
the
broad
plains
on
their
hardy
the
railroad
and
all
its
appurtenances
were
just
as
orderly
as
they
would
have
been
in
england
the
railway
architecture
of
which
it
resembled
though
the
cars
were
of
the
american
style
everything
from
engine
to
yards
was
so
english
one
felt
sure
that
had
they
spoken
their
language
the
traincrews
would
have
called
the
little
and
spoken
of
metals
and
illustration
the
mixture
of
types
in
the
argentine
native
in
and
a
basque
immigrant
from
the
pyrenees
it
was
some
time
after
dark
that
we
pulled
into
santo
tomé
or
at
least
into
a
station
bearing
that
name
and
i
concluded
that
i
had
ridden
far
enough
for
the
time
being
the
train
did
not
enter
the
town
perhaps
because
it
would
have
been
hard
to
decide
just
where
the
town
was
in
the
argentine
these
are
scattered
over
a
vast
amount
of
ground
in
striking
contrast
to
the
crowding
common
to
the
andes
a
the
flat
country
far
and
wide
i
set
out
in
the
moonlight
along
a
broad
highway
and
wandered
until
any
hope
of
finding
a
town
died
out
then
ran
upon
a
few
low
scattered
houses
that
suggested
some
insignificant
village
like
bolivia
s
tropical
cities
then
i
went
on
and
on
until
there
grew
up
about
me
an
immense
town
never
crowded
together
yet
with
an
enormous
plaza
long
stretches
of
electric
a
checkerboard
city
of
wide
streets
and
long
blocks
each
house
set
in
its
own
big
garden
a
town
citified
with
many
automobiles
and
but
a
single
church
of
moderate
size
and
inconspicuous
life
began
to
renew
about
the
station
at
the
restaurant
opened
watchmen
lighted
big
gasoline
the
international
rolled
in
and
we
were
off
again
with
ample
room
even
in
the
car
three
hours
later
i
sat
up
to
watch
the
sun
rise
red
out
of
uruguay
across
the
river
about
the
vast
unkempt
plains
stood
clumps
of
pampa
trees
at
the
towns
were
many
gay
with
blossoms
i
had
almost
written
until
i
remembered
it
was
autumn
the
a
bird
not
unlike
a
small
robin
in
appearance
though
with
less
red
began
to
build
its
mud
nest
on
the
wooden
of
the
all
day
long
for
hundreds
of
miles
there
was
an
average
of
a
nest
on
every
third
pole
always
on
the
side
farthest
from
the
railroad
as
if
the
noise
of
the
trains
were
annoying
to
its
inhabitants
the
arched
doorway
always
toward
the
direction
from
which
we
catch
perhaps
the
warmer
breezes
among
hundreds
of
nests
i
saw
only
three
or
four
exceptions
to
this
and
all
day
long
only
one
built
anywhere
else
than
on
the
close
against
the
pole
one
daring
architect
had
set
his
on
the
top
of
the
pole
itself
neatly
capping
it
as
this
particular
pole
had
its
already
occupied
it
looked
as
if
the
bird
above
was
a
fellow
who
had
failed
to
stake
his
claim
in
time
but
who
insisted
nevertheless
on
living
in
that
particular
spot
the
country
grew
more
and
more
like
our
own
in
climate
creature
comforts
uniformed
mailmen
carts
and
wagons
some
of
them
of
the
style
of
poland
rattling
past
on
broad
highways
busy
towns
along
the
way
at
only
the
more
important
of
which
the
train
halted
briefly
and
between
them
raced
swiftly
and
smoothly
southward
through
the
windows
the
horizon
of
the
great
rolling
pampa
continually
rose
and
fell
sometimes
it
was
punctuated
with
a
grove
of
trees
more
rarely
with
a
small
forest
the
chiefly
unfenced
plains
everywhere
sprinkled
with
cattle
here
and
there
a
the
south
american
ostrich
trotted
awkwardly
away
across
the
prairie
where
there
were
fences
the
wires
ran
through
the
posts
by
holes
bored
in
them
rather
than
being
secured
by
staples
fields
of
in
long
rows
seemed
incongruous
in
south
america
it
brought
a
feeling
of
satisfaction
to
see
industry
and
decent
living
again
things
being
done
instead
of
merely
doing
themselves
some
industrious
country
boys
climbed
a
fence
with
bags
of
large
juicy
watermelons
for
sale
boys
merely
in
quest
of
and
not
because
their
livelihood
depended
upon
it
the
population
at
large
was
too
busy
to
bother
with
station
hawking
countrymen
wore
enormous
trousers
tucked
into
soft
or
drawn
up
about
the
bare

above

if
the
cost
of
cloth
were
of
no
importance
any
lady
would
have
remained
ladylike
in
them
now
and
then
the
river
drew
up
so
close
beside
us
that
we
could
look
far
off
across
uruguay
spread
out
on
the
other
side
at
length
we
sighted
ahead
a
sort
of
oriental
mist
hovering
about
it
a
whitish
city
with
a
church
suggesting
minarets
a
city
set
on
a
knoll
not
unlike
jerusalem
yet
this
was
not
the
town
we
were
approaching
but
salto
in
the
república
oriental
over
the
river
great
fields
of
grapes
well
tended
began
to
race
by
us
suburban
houses
thickened
and
we
drew
up
at
the
city
of
concordia
four
hundred
miles
south
of
posadas
on
the
frontier
i
had
left
hours
before
in
the
andes
cities
had
been
mere
languid
villages
in
the
argentine
places
the
world
at
large
had
never
heard
of
were
large
flourishing
metropolises
concordia
numbers
twenty
thousand
inhabitants
virtually
all
white
and
all
alive
yet
it
is
not
even
the
capital
but
merely
the
second
city
of
the
province
of
the
entre
between
the
rivers
paraná
and
uruguay
famous
for
its
or
establishments
well
spread
out
it
has
few
churches
and
no
of
priests
the
former
with
few
bells
and
those
of
agreeable
tone
which
are
not
too
often
instead
of
being
beaten
with
an
infernal
din
are
few
the
majority
of
the
population
finds
something
more
worth
while
than
shopkeeping
its
inhabitants
know
how
to
pass
two
abreast
on
the
sidewalks
women
on
bicycles
bring
a
frequent
start
of
surprise
swarms
of
cleanly
dressed
boys
and
girls
sally
forth
from
big
schools
where
coeducation
reigns
bootblacks
clad
like
business
men
and
carrying
upholstered
and
decorated
seats
seek
their
clients
in
the
streets
and
plazas
electric
give
excellent
service
electric
lights
both
in
streets
and
houses
were
even
more
brilliant
than
our
own
the
public
library
was
actually
open
and
functioning
and
did
hot
spend
its
time
staring
at
the
foreigner
who
had
come
to
read
in
the
hotel
garabaldi
such
a
place
as
the
name
was
served
with
meals
as
freely
as
in
europe
and
though
only
the
abode
of
workingmen
it
was
superior
to
the
best
hostelry
of
andean
cities
real
beds
had
now
taken
the
place
of
canvas
cots
at
the
rear
was
an
de
or
outdoor
bowling
alley
for
the
clientèle
of
italian
workmen
i
slipped
across
the
river
next
afternoon
to
salto
in
uruguay
adding
another
country
to
my
growing
collection
one
went
and
came
freely
without
frontier
formalities
salto
is
large
and
several
times
older
than
concordia
with
many
buildings
yet
with
a
suggestion
of
seediness
a
bit
more
squalor
and
barefootedness
its
church
not
so
imposing
and
as
it
looks
at
a
distance
its
policemen
in
rather
shiny
and
threadbare
uniforms
its
streets
cobbled
rather
than
smoothly
paved
in
short
it
is
more
spanish
in
type
more
clustered
together
with
a
general
air
suggesting
that
this
is
not
quite
so
live
and
hopeful
a
country
as
that
over
the
river
many
proud
old
families
live
here
yet
the
head
of
more
than
one
of
them
slips
across
daily
to
do
business
in
the
argentine
one
can
go
on
from
concordia
to
buenos
aires
by
rail
but
i
chose
to
take
the
overnight
journey
on
a
big
mihanovich
with
all
the
conveniences
of
an
ocean
liner
the
flat
sometimes
rolling
occasionally
bushy
shores
of
the
uruguay
were
broken
by
several
towns
notably
the
two
model
establishments
producing
leibig
s
extract
of
beef
when
i
returned
on
deck
next
morning
a
brilliant
sun
was
pouring
its
rays
blindingly
over
the
stream
misnamed
the
plata
the
river
of
silver
by
sebastian
gaboto
was
none
other
than
our
own
sebastian
he
fancied
it
ran
uphill
to
the
silver
mines
of
peru
the
indians
called
it
the
the
river
large
as
a
sea
a
truer
name
for
on
the
right
it
stretched
away
to
the
dimmest
of
broken
land
forms
and
soon
these
too
disappeared
and
a
sea
spread
unbroken
to
the
horizon
for
a
time
we
hugged
the
uruguayan
shore
then
swung
the
blazing
sun
around
behind
us
and
struck
out
for
what
but
for
its
color
might
have
been
the
open
sea
soon
we
began
to
pass
buoys
of
the
argentine
government
marked
r
with
the
kilometers
to
the
end
of
my
journey
painted
upon
them
toward
eight
where
the
yellow
sea
and
the
sky
met
the
vast
perfect
circle
of
the
horizon
was
broken
by
a
patch
of
faint
white
it
was
only
a
tiny
narrow
line
down
at
the
extreme
edge
of
the
great
inverted
bowl
of
sky
above
us
yet
so
inches
in
should
it
turn
out
to
be
a
city
as
i
began
to
suspect
since
we
were
headed
directly
for
it
it
would
be
a
large
one
indeed
then
the
white
patch
began
to
take
on
faint
individual
shape
and
above
us
the
wireless
was
spitting
its
message
to
the
yet
invisible
world
ahead
an
hour
later
we
were
in
the
midst
of
buoys
large
and
small
marking
the
canal
sur
or
south
channel
boats
and
steamers
appeared
and
sailing
vessels
spread
their
white
wings
across
the
yellow
waters
on
all
sides
of
us
while
the
city
stretched
along
the
horizon
ahead
had
turned
from
white
to
gray
with
a
tint
of
red
neither
color
nor
edifice
conspicuous
except
for
two
groups
of
huge
brick
belching
forth
into
the
brilliant
sky
even
after
the
long
line
of
buildings
had
taken
on
definite
form
and
one
could
all
but
count
their
windows
the
city
seemed
still
to
sit
on
the
yellow
sea
one
was
struck
too
by
the
narrowness
of
the
strip
the
buildings
seemed
for
the
most
part
a
bare
four
stories
with
only
here
and
there
one
as
high
as
ten
cutting
into
the
landless
two
tugs
took
possession
of
us
dragging
us
up
a
narrow
channel
through
a
wilderness
of
shipping
where
we
must
soon
stop
for
lack
of
space
until
we
spied
an
unoccupied
bit
of
wharf
and
warped
gradually
into
it
it
was
a
morning
the
ninth
of
march
while
the
rest
waited
for
their
baggage
to
be
examined
an
official
glanced
at
my
bundle
jerked
a
thumb
scornfully
over
a
shoulder
and
i
stepped
out
into
the
metropolitan
rumble
