frontispiece
several
times
she
circled
around
high
over
the
smiling
pool
some
folks
call
him
alligator
and
some
just
just
tuck
that
fact
away
in
that
empty
head
of
yours
and
never
say
ca
yes
said
he
in
a
low
voice
i
am
quack
those
were
happy
days
indeed
for
and

pond

i
peter
rabbit
becomes
acquainted
with
quack
make
a
new
acquaintance
every
time
you
can
you
find
it
interesting
and
a
very
helpful
plan
it
means
more
knowledge
you
can
not
meet
any
one
without
learning
something
from
him
if
you
keep
your
ears
open
and
your
eyes
open
every
one
is
at
least
a
little
different
from
every
one
else
and
the
more
people
you
know
the
more
you
may
learn
peter
rabbit
knows
this
and
that
is
one
reason
he
always
is
so
eager
to
find
out
about
other
people
he
had
left
jimmy
skunk
and
bobby
coon
in
the
green
forest
and
had
headed
for
the
smiling
pool
to
see
if
grandfather
frog
was
awake
yet
he
had
no
idea
of
meeting
a
stranger
there
and
so
you
can
imagine
just
how
surprised
he
was
when
he
got
in
sight
of
the
smiling
pool
to
see
some
one
whom
he
never
had
seen
before
swimming
about
there
he
knew
right
away
who
it
was
he
knew
that
it
was
quack
the
duck
because
he
had
often
heard
about
her
and
then
too
it
was
very
clear
from
her
looks
that
she
was
a
cousin
of
the
ducks
he
had
seen
in
farmer
brown
dooryard
the
difference
was
that
while
they
were
big
and
white
and
quack
was
smaller
brown
very
trim
and
looked
anything
but
stupid
peter
was
so
surprised
to
see
her
in
the
smiling
pool
that
he
almost
forgot
to
be
polite
i
am
afraid
he
stared
in
a
very
impolite
way
as
he
hurried
to
the
edge
of
the
bank
i
suppose
said
peter
that
you
are
quack
but
i
never
expected
to
see
you
unless
i
should
go
over
to
the
big
river
and
that
is
a
place
i
never
have
visited
and
hardly
expect
to
because
it
is
too
far
from
the
dear
old
you
are
quack
are
you
yes
replied
quack
and
you
must
be
peter
rabbit
i
heard
of
you
very
all
the
time
quack
was
swimming
back
and
forth
and
in
little
circles
in
the
most
uneasy
way
i
hope
you
heard
nothing
but
good
of
me
replied
peter
quack
stopped
her
uneasy
swimming
for
a
minute
and
almost
smiled
as
she
looked
at
peter
the
worst
i
have
heard
is
that
you
are
very
curious
about
other
people
affairs
said
she
peter
looked
a
wee
wee
bit
foolish
and
then
he
laughed
right
out
i
guess
that
is
true
enough
said
he
i
like
to
learn
all
i
can
and
how
can
i
learn
without
being
curious
i
curious
right
now
i
wondering
what
brings
you
to
the
smiling
pool
when
you
never
have
been
here
before
it
is
the
last
place
in
the
world
i
ever
expected
to
find
that
why
i
here
replied
quack
i
hope
others
feel
the
same
way
i
came
here
because
i
just
had
to
find
some
place
where
people
would
expect
to
find
me
and
so
would
come
looking
for
me
little
joe
otter
saw
me
yesterday
on
the
big
river
and
told
me
of
this
place
and
so
because
i
just
had
to
go
somewhere
i
came
peter
eyes
opened
very
wide
with
surprise
why
he
exclaimed
i
should
think
you
would
be
perfectly
safe
on
the
big
river
i
do
see
how
any
harm
can
possibly
come
to
you
out
the
words
were
no
sooner
out
of
peter
mouth
than
a
faint
bang
sounded
from
way
off
towards
the
big
river
quack
gave
a
great
start
and
half
lifted
her
wings
as
if
to
fly
but
she
thought
better
of
it
and
then
peter
saw
that
she
was
trembling
all
over
did
you
hear
that
she
asked
in
a
faint
voice
peter
nodded
that
was
a
gun
a
terrible
gun
but
it
was
a
long
way
from
here
said
he
it
was
over
on
the
big
river
said
quack
that
why
it
is
safe
for
me
over
there
that
why
i
just
had
to
find
some
other
place
oh
dear
the
very
sound
of
a
gun
sets
me
to
shaking
and
makes
my
heart
feel
as
if
it
would
stop
beating
are
you
sure
i
am
perfectly
safe
here
perfectly
spoke
up
jerry
muskrat
who
had
been
listening
from
the
top
of
the
big
rock
where
he
was
lunching
on
a
clam
unless
you
are
not
smart
enough
to
keep
out
of
the
clutches
of
reddy
fox
or
old
man
coyote
or
hooty
the
owl
or
redtail
the
i
not
afraid
of
them
declared
quack
it
those
creatures
with
terrible
guns
i
afraid
of
and
she
began
to
swim
about
more
uneasily
than
ever
ii
quack
is
distrustful
jerry
muskrat
thinks
there
is
no
place
in
the
world
like
the
smiling
pool
so
for
the
matter
of
that
does
grandfather
frog
and
also
spotty
the
turtle
you
see
they
have
spent
their
lives
there
and
know
little
about
the
rest
of
the
great
world
when
quack
explained
that
all
she
feared
was
that
a
creature
with
a
terrible
gun
might
find
her
there
jerry
muskrat
hastened
to
tell
her
that
she
had
nothing
to
worry
about
on
that
account
no
one
hunts
here
now
that
farmer
brown
boy
has
put
away
his
terrible
gun
explained
jerry
there
was
a
time
when
he
used
to
hunt
here
and
set
traps
which
are
worse
than
terrible
guns
but
that
was
long
ago
before
he
knew
any
who
is
farmer
brown
boy
demanded
quack
looking
more
anxious
than
ever
is
he
one
of
those
creatures
yes
said
peter
rabbit
who
had
been
listening
with
all
his
ears
but
he
is
the
best
friend
we
quaddies
have
got
he
is
such
a
good
friend
that
he
ought
to
be
a
quaddy
himself
why
this
last
winter
he
fed
some
of
us
when
food
was
scarce
and
he
saved
grouse
when
she
was
caught
in
a
snare
which
you
know
is
a
kind
of
trap
he
wo
let
any
harm
come
to
you
here
i
would
trust
him
not
for
one
single
little
minute
declared
quack
i
would
trust
one
of
those
creatures
not
one
you
say
he
fed
some
of
you
last
winter
but
that
mean
anything
good
do
you
know
what
i
known
these
creatures
to
do
what
demanded
peter
and
jerry
together
i
known
them
to
scatter
food
where
we
ducks
would
be
sure
to
find
it
and
to
take
the
greatest
care
that
nothing
should
frighten
us
while
we
were
eating
and
then
after
we
had
got
in
the
habit
of
feeding
in
that
particular
place
and
had
grown
to
feel
perfectly
safe
there
they
have
hidden
close
by
until
a
lot
of
us
were
feeding
together
and
then
fired
their
terrible
guns
and
killed
a
lot
of
my
friends
and
dreadfully
hurt
a
lot
more
i
would
trust
one
of
them
not
one
oh
how
dreadful
cried
peter
looking
quite
as
shocked
as
he
felt
then
he
added
eagerly
but
our
farmer
brown
boy
would
do
anything
like
that
you
have
the
least
thing
to
fear
from
perhaps
not
said
quack
shaking
her
head
doubtfully
but
i
would
trust
him
i
would
trust
him
as
far
off
as
i
could
see
him
the
smiling
pool
is
a
very
nice
place
although
it
is
dreadfully
small
but
if
farmer
brown
boy
is
likely
to
come
over
here
i
guess
i
better
look
for
some
other
place
though
goodness
knows
where
i
will
find
one
where
i
will
feel
perfectly
you
are
safe
right
here
if
you
have
sense
enough
to
stay
here
declared
jerry
muskrat
rather
testily
do
you
suppose
peter
and
i
know
what
we
are
talking
about
i
wish
i
could
believe
so
returned
quack
sadly
but
if
you
had
been
through
what
i
been
through
and
suffered
what
suffered
you
would
believe
any
place
safe
and
you
certainly
would
trust
one
of
those
creatures
why
for
weeks
they
have
given
me
a
chance
to
get
a
square
meal
and
and
i
do
know
what
has
become
of
quack
and
i
all
alone
there
was
a
little
sob
in
her
voice
and
tears
in
her
eyes
tell
us
all
about
it
begged
peter
perhaps
we
can
help
iii
quack
tells
about
her
home
it
a
long
story
said
quack
shaking
the
tears
from
her
eyes
and
i
hardly
know
where
to
begin
at
the
beginning
said
jerry
muskrat
your
home
is
somewhere
way
up
in
the
northland
where
honker
the
goose
lives
is
it
quack
nodded
i
wish
i
were
there
this
very
minute
she
replied
the
tears
coming
again
but
sometimes
i
doubt
if
ever
i
get
there
again
you
folks
who
do
have
to
leave
your
homes
every
year
do
know
how
well
off
you
are
or
how
much
you
have
to
be
thankful
i
never
could
understand
what
people
want
to
leave
their
homes
for
anyway
declared
peter
we
do
leave
because
we
want
to
but
because
we
have
to
replied
quack
and
we
go
back
just
as
soon
as
we
can
what
would
you
do
if
you
could
find
a
single
thing
to
eat
i
guess
i
starve
replied
peter
simply
i
guess
you
would
and
that
is
just
what
we
would
do
if
we
take
the
long
journey
south
when
jack
frost
freezes
everything
tight
up
there
where
my
home
is
returned
quack
he
comes
earlier
up
there
and
stays
twice
as
long
as
he
does
here
and
makes
ten
times
as
much
ice
and
snow
we
get
most
of
our
food
in
the
water
or
in
the
mud
under
the
water
as
of
course
you
know
and
when
the
water
is
frozen
there
is
a
scrap
of
anything
we
can
get
to
eat
we
just
have
to
come
south
it
is
because
we
want
to
but
because
we
must
there
is
nothing
else
for
us
to
then
i
do
see
what
you
want
to
make
your
home
in
such
a
place
for
said
practical
peter
i
should
think
you
would
make
it
where
you
can
live
all
the
year
i
was
born
up
there
and
i
love
it
just
as
you
love
the
dear
old
replied
quack
simply
it
is
home
and
there
is
no
place
like
home
besides
it
is
a
very
beautiful
and
a
very
wonderful
place
in
summer
there
is
everything
that
ducks
and
geese
love
we
have
all
we
want
of
the
food
we
love
best
everywhere
is
shallow
water
with
tall
grass
growing
in
huh
interrupted
peter
i
would
think
much
of
a
place
like
that
because
you
do
know
what
is
good
snapped
jerry
muskrat
it
would
suit
me
he
added
with
shining
eyes
there
are
the
dearest
little
islands
just
made
for
safe
continued
quack
without
heeding
the
interruptions
and
the
days
are
long
and
it
is
easy
to
hide
and
there
is
nothing
to
fear
for
creatures
with
terrible
guns
never
come
if
there
is
nothing
to
fear
why
do
you
care
about
places
to
hide
demanded
peter
well
of
course
we
have
enemies
just
as
you
do
here
but
they
are
natural
enemies
foxes
and
minks
and
hawks
and
owls
explained
quack
of
course
we
have
to
watch
out
for
them
and
have
places
where
we
can
hide
from
them
but
it
is
our
wits
against
their
wits
and
it
is
our
own
fault
if
we
get
caught
that
is
perfectly
fair
so
we
do
mind
that
it
is
only
men
who
are
not
fair
they
do
know
what
fairness
peter
nodded
that
he
understood
and
quack
went
on
last
summer
quack
and
i
had
our
nest
on
the
dearest
little
island
and
no
one
found
it
first
we
had
twelve
eggs
and
then
twelve
of
the
dearest
babies
you
ever
maybe
said
peter
doubtfully
thinking
of
his
own
babies
they
grew
so
fast
that
by
the
time
the
cold
weather
came
they
were
as
big
as
their
father
and
mother
continued
quack
and
they
were
smart
too
they
had
learned
how
to
take
care
of
themselves
just
as
well
as
i
could
i
certainly
was
proud
of
that
family
but
now
i
do
know
where
one
of
them
quack
suddenly
choked
up
with
grief
and
peter
rabbit
politely
turned
his
head
away
iv
quack
continues
her
story
when
quack
told
of
her
twelve
children
and
how
she
did
know
where
one
of
them
was
peter
rabbit
and
jerry
muskrat
knew
just
how
badly
she
was
feeling
and
they
turned
their
heads
away
and
pretended
that
they
did
see
her
tears
in
a
few
minutes
she
bravely
went
on
with
her
story
when
jack
frost
came
and
we
knew
it
was
time
to
begin
the
long
journey
quack
and
myself
and
our
twelve
children
joined
with
some
other
duck
families
and
with
quack
in
the
lead
we
started
for
our
winter
home
which
really
is
a
home
but
just
a
place
to
stay
for
a
while
we
had
nothing
much
to
fear
we
would
fly
by
day
and
at
night
rest
in
some
quiet
lake
or
pond
or
on
some
river
with
the
great
woods
all
about
us
or
sometimes
great
marshes
perhaps
you
do
know
what
marshes
are
if
the
green
meadows
here
had
little
streams
of
water
running
every
which
way
through
them
and
the
ground
was
all
soft
and
muddy
and
full
of
water
and
the
grass
grew
tall
they
would
be
jerry
muskrat
eyes
sparkled
i
would
like
a
place
like
that
he
exclaimed
you
certainly
would
replied
quack
we
always
find
lots
of
your
relatives
in
such
marshes
must
be
something
like
swamps
ventured
peter
rabbit
who
had
been
thinking
the
matter
over
very
much
the
same
only
with
grass
and
rushes
in
place
of
trees
and
bushes
replied
quack
there
is
plenty
to
eat
and
the
loveliest
in
some
of
these
we
stayed
days
at
a
time
in
fact
we
stayed
until
jack
frost
came
to
drive
us
out
then
as
we
flew
we
began
to
see
the
homes
of
these
terrible
creatures
called
men
and
from
that
time
on
we
never
knew
a
minute
of
peace
excepting
when
we
were
flying
high
in
the
air
or
far
out
over
the
water
if
we
could
have
just
kept
flying
all
the
time
or
never
had
to
go
near
the
shore
we
would
have
been
all
right
but
we
had
to
of
course
said
peter
everybody
has
to
and
we
had
to
rest
said
quack
certainly
said
peter
everybody
has
to
do
and
to
eat
we
had
to
go
in
close
to
shore
where
the
water
was
not
at
all
deep
because
it
is
only
in
such
places
that
we
can
get
food
continued
quack
it
takes
a
lot
of
strength
to
fly
as
we
fly
and
strength
requires
plenty
of
food
quack
knew
all
the
best
for
he
had
made
the
long
journey
several
times
so
every
day
he
would
lead
the
way
to
one
of
these
he
always
chose
the
wildest
and
most
lonely
looking
places
he
could
find
as
far
as
possible
from
the
homes
of
men
but
even
then
he
was
never
careless
he
would
lead
us
around
back
and
forth
over
the
place
he
had
chosen
and
we
would
all
look
with
all
our
might
for
signs
of
danger
if
we
saw
none
we
would
drop
down
a
little
nearer
and
a
little
nearer
but
with
all
our
watchfulness
we
never
could
be
sure
absolutely
sure
that
all
was
safe
sometimes
those
terrible
creatures
would
be
hiding
in
the
very
middle
of
the
wildest
most
lonely
looking
marshes
they
would
be
covered
with
grass
so
that
we
could
see
them
then
as
we
flew
over
them
would
come
the
bang
bang
bang
bang
of
terrible
guns
and
always
some
of
our
flock
would
drop
we
would
have
to
leave
them
behind
for
we
knew
if
we
wanted
to
live
we
must
get
beyond
the
reach
of
those
terrible
guns
so
we
would
fly
our
hardest
it
was
awful
just
simply
awful
quack
paused
and
shuddered
and
peter
rabbit
and
jerry
muskrat
shuddered
in
sympathy
sometimes
we
would
have
to
try
three
or
four
before
we
found
one
where
there
were
no
terrible
guns
and
when
we
did
find
one
we
would
be
so
tired
and
frightened
that
we
enjoy
our
food
and
we
did
dare
to
sleep
without
some
one
on
watch
all
the
time
it
was
like
that
every
day
the
farther
we
got
the
worse
it
became
our
flock
grew
smaller
and
smaller
those
who
escaped
the
terrible
guns
would
be
so
frightened
that
they
would
forget
to
follow
their
leader
and
would
fly
in
different
directions
and
later
perhaps
join
other
flocks
so
it
was
that
when
at
last
we
reached
the
place
in
the
sunny
southland
for
which
we
had
started
quack
and
i
were
alone
what
became
of
our
twelve
children
i
do
know
i
am
afraid
the
terrible
guns
killed
some
i
hope
some
joined
other
flocks
and
escaped
but
i
do
i
hope
they
did
too
said
peter
v
peter
learns
more
of
quack
troubles
it
often
happens
when
we
know
the
troubles
that
our
friends
pass
through
our
own
seem
very
small
indeed
always
find
that
this
is
true
my
you
must
have
felt
glad
when
you
reached
your
winter
home
exclaimed
peter
rabbit
when
quack
finished
the
account
of
her
long
terrible
journey
from
her
summer
home
in
the
far
northland
to
her
winter
home
in
the
far
southland
i
did
replied
quack
but
all
the
time
i
could
forget
those
to
whom
terrible
things
had
happened
on
the
way
down
and
then
too
i
kept
dreading
the
long
journey
i
do
see
why
you
did
stay
right
there
i
would
have
said
peter
nodding
his
head
with
an
air
of
great
wisdom
not
if
you
were
i
replied
quack
in
the
first
place
it
is
a
proper
place
in
which
to
bring
up
young
ducks
and
make
them
strong
and
healthy
in
the
second
place
there
are
more
dangers
down
there
for
young
ducks
than
up
in
the
far
northland
in
the
third
place
there
is
room
for
all
the
ducks
to
nest
properly
and
lastly
there
is
a
great
longing
for
our
real
home
which
old
mother
nature
has
put
in
our
hearts
and
which
just
makes
us
go
we
be
happy
if
we
is
the
journey
back
as
bad
as
the
journey
down
asked
peter
worse
very
much
worse
replied
quack
sadly
you
can
see
for
yourself
just
how
bad
it
is
for
here
i
am
all
tears
filled
quack
eyes
it
is
almost
too
terrible
to
talk
about
she
continued
after
a
minute
you
see
for
one
thing
food
as
plentiful
as
it
is
in
the
fall
and
we
just
have
to
go
wherever
it
is
to
be
found
those
creatures
know
where
those
are
just
as
well
as
we
do
and
they
hide
there
with
their
terrible
guns
just
as
they
did
when
we
were
coming
south
but
it
is
much
worse
now
very
much
worse
you
see
when
we
were
going
the
other
way
if
we
found
them
at
one
place
we
could
go
on
to
another
but
when
we
are
going
north
we
can
not
always
do
that
we
can
not
go
any
faster
than
jack
frost
does
sometimes
we
are
driven
out
of
a
place
by
the
bang
bang
of
the
terrible
guns
and
go
on
only
to
find
that
we
have
caught
up
with
jack
frost
and
that
the
ponds
and
the
rivers
are
still
covered
with
ice
then
there
is
nothing
to
do
but
to
turn
back
to
where
those
terrible
guns
are
waiting
for
us
we
just
have
to
do
quack
stopped
and
shivered
it
seems
to
me
i
have
heard
nothing
but
the
noise
of
those
terrible
guns
ever
since
we
started
said
she
i
have
had
a
good
square
meal
for
days
and
days
nor
a
good
rest
that
is
what
makes
me
so
dreadfully
nervous
sometimes
when
we
had
been
driven
from
place
to
place
until
we
had
caught
up
with
jack
frost
there
would
be
nothing
but
ice
excepting
in
small
places
in
a
river
where
the
water
runs
too
swiftly
to
freeze
we
would
just
have
to
drop
into
one
of
these
to
rest
a
little
because
we
had
flown
so
far
that
our
wings
ached
as
if
they
would
drop
off
then
just
as
we
would
think
we
were
safe
for
a
little
while
there
would
come
the
bang
of
a
terrible
gun
then
we
would
have
to
fly
again
as
long
as
we
could
and
finally
come
back
to
the
same
place
because
there
was
no
other
place
where
we
could
go
then
we
would
have
to
do
it
all
over
again
until
night
came
sometimes
i
think
that
those
men
with
terrible
guns
must
hate
us
and
want
to
kill
every
one
of
us
if
they
did
they
would
have
a
little
bit
of
pity
they
simply
have
any
hearts
at
it
does
seem
so
agreed
peter
but
wait
until
you
know
farmer
brown
boy
he
got
a
heart
he
added
brightly
i
do
want
to
know
him
retorted
quack
if
he
comes
near
here
you
see
me
leave
in
a
hurry
i
would
trust
one
of
them
not
one
minute
you
do
think
he
will
come
do
you
peter
sat
up
and
looked
across
the
green
meadows
and
his
heart
sank
he
coming
now
but
i
sure
he
wo
hurt
you
quack
said
he
but
quack
would
wait
to
see
with
a
hasty
promise
to
come
back
when
the
way
was
clear
she
jumped
into
the
air
and
on
swift
wings
disappeared
towards
the
big
river
vi
farmer
brown
boy
visits
the
smiling
pool
farmer
brown
boy
had
heard
welcome
robin
singing
in
the
old
orchard
quite
as
soon
as
peter
rabbit
had
and
that
song
of
cheer
up
cheer
up
cheer
up
cheer
had
awakened
quite
as
much
gladness
in
his
heart
as
it
had
in
peter
heart
it
meant
that
mistress
spring
really
had
arrived
and
that
over
in
the
green
forest
and
down
on
the
green
meadows
there
would
soon
be
shy
blue
and
just
as
shy
white
violets
to
look
for
and
other
flowers
almost
if
not
quite
as
sweet
and
lovely
it
meant
that
his
feathered
friends
would
soon
be
busy
and
building
it
meant
that
his
little
friends
in
fur
would
also
be
doing
something
very
similar
if
they
had
not
already
done
so
it
meant
that
soon
there
would
be
a
million
lovely
things
to
see
and
a
million
joyous
sounds
to
hear
so
the
sound
of
welcome
robin
voice
made
the
heart
of
farmer
boy
even
more
happy
than
it
was
before
and
as
welcome
robin
just
had
to
sing
so
farmer
brown
boy
just
had
to
whistle
when
his
work
was
finished
it
seemed
to
farmer
brown
boy
that
something
was
calling
him
calling
him
to
get
out
on
the
green
meadows
or
over
in
the
green
forest
and
share
in
the
happiness
of
all
the
little
people
there
so
presently
he
decided
that
he
would
go
down
to
the
smiling
pool
to
find
out
how
jerry
muskrat
was
and
if
grandfather
frog
was
awake
yet
and
if
the
sweet
singers
of
the
smiling
pool
had
begun
their
wonderful
spring
chorus
down
the
crooked
little
path
cross
the
green
meadows
he
tramped
and
as
he
drew
near
the
smiling
pool
he
stopped
whistling
lest
the
sound
should
frighten
some
of
the
little
people
there
he
was
still
some
distance
from
the
smiling
pool
when
out
of
it
sprang
a
big
bird
and
on
swift
whistling
wings
flew
away
in
the
direction
of
the
big
river
farmer
brown
boy
stopped
and
watched
until
the
bird
had
disappeared
and
on
his
face
was
a
look
of
great
surprise
as
i
live
that
was
a
duck
he
exclaimed
that
is
the
first
time
i
ever
known
a
wild
duck
to
be
in
the
smiling
pool
i
wonder
what
under
the
sun
could
have
brought
her
over
just
then
there
was
a
distant
bang
in
the
direction
of
the
big
river
farmer
brown
boy
scowled
and
it
made
his
face
very
that
it
he
muttered
hunters
are
shooting
the
ducks
on
their
way
north
and
have
driven
the
poor
things
to
look
for
any
little
mudhole
where
they
can
get
a
little
rest
probably
that
duck
has
been
shot
at
so
many
times
on
the
big
river
that
she
felt
safer
over
here
in
the
smiling
pool
little
as
it
farmer
brown
boy
had
guessed
exactly
right
as
you
and
i
know
and
as
peter
rabbit
and
jerry
muskrat
knew
it
a
shame
a
downright
shame
that
any
one
should
want
to
shoot
birds
on
their
way
to
their
and
that
the
law
should
let
them
if
they
do
want
to
some
people
have
any
hearts
they
all
stomachs
i
hope
that
fellow
who
shot
just
now
over
there
on
the
big
river
hit
anything
and
i
wish
that
gun
of
his
might
have
kicked
a
little
sense
of
what
is
right
and
fair
into
his
head
but
of
course
it
he
grinned
at
the
idea
and
then
he
continued
his
way
towards
the
smiling
pool
he
hoped
he
might
find
another
duck
there
and
he
approached
the
smiling
pool
very
very
carefully
but
when
he
reached
a
point
where
he
could
see
all
over
the
smiling
pool
there
was
no
one
to
be
seen
save
jerry
muskrat
sitting
on
the
big
rock
and
peter
rabbit
on
the
bank
on
the
other
side
farmer
brown
boy
smiled
when
he
saw
them
hello
jerry
muskrat
said
he
i
wonder
how
a
bite
of
carrot
would
taste
to
he
felt
in
his
pocket
and
brought
out
a
couple
of
carrots
one
he
put
on
a
little
tussock
in
the
water
where
he
knew
jerry
would
find
it
the
other
he
tossed
across
the
smiling
pool
where
he
felt
sure
peter
would
find
it
presently
he
noticed
two
or
three
feathers
on
the
water
close
to
the
edge
of
the
bank
quack
had
left
them
there
i
believe
that
was
a
mallard
duck
said
he
as
he
studied
them
i
know
what
i
do
i
go
straight
back
home
and
get
some
wheat
and
corn
and
put
it
here
on
the
edge
of
the
smiling
pool
perhaps
she
will
come
back
and
find
and
this
is
just
what
farmer
brown
boy
did
vii
quack
returns
peter
rabbit
just
could
go
back
to
the
dear
old
he
just
had
to
know
if
quack
would
come
back
to
the
smiling
pool
he
had
seen
farmer
brown
boy
come
there
a
second
time
and
scatter
wheat
and
corn
among
the
brown
stalks
of
last
rushes
and
he
had
guessed
why
farmer
brown
boy
had
done
this
he
had
guessed
that
they
had
been
put
there
especially
for
quack
and
if
she
should
come
back
as
she
had
promised
to
do
he
wanted
to
be
on
hand
when
she
found
those
good
things
to
eat
and
hear
what
she
would
say
so
peter
stayed
over
near
the
smiling
pool
and
hoped
with
all
his
might
that
reddy
fox
or
old
man
coyote
would
not
take
it
into
his
head
to
come
hunting
over
there
as
luck
would
have
it
neither
of
them
did
and
peter
had
a
very
pleasant
time
gossiping
with
jerry
muskrat
listening
to
the
sweet
voices
of
unseen
singers
in
the
smiling
pool
the
hylas
which
some
people
call
peepers
and
eating
the
carrot
which
farmer
brown
boy
had
left
for
him
jolly
round
red
sun
was
just
getting
ready
to
go
to
bed
behind
the
purple
hills
when
quack
returned
the
first
peter
knew
of
her
coming
was
the
whistle
of
her
wings
as
she
passed
over
him
several
times
she
circled
around
high
over
the
smiling
pool
and
peter
simply
stared
in
admiration
at
the
speed
with
which
she
flew
it
did
seem
possible
that
one
so
big
could
move
through
the
air
so
fast
twice
she
set
her
wings
and
seemed
to
just
slide
down
almost
to
the
surface
of
the
smiling
pool
only
to
start
her
stout
wings
in
motion
once
more
and
circle
around
again
it
was
very
clear
that
she
was
terribly
nervous
and
suspicious
the
third
time
she
landed
in
the
water
with
a
splash
and
sat
perfectly
still
with
her
head
stretched
up
looking
and
listening
with
all
her
might
it
all
right
there
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
said
jerry
muskrat
are
you
sure
asked
quack
anxiously
i
been
fooled
too
often
by
men
with
their
terrible
guns
to
ever
feel
absolutely
sure
that
one
is
hiding
and
waiting
to
shoot
as
she
spoke
she
swam
about
nervously
peter
rabbit
and
i
have
been
here
ever
since
you
left
and
i
guess
we
ought
to
know
replied
jerry
muskrat
rather
shortly
there
has
been
anybody
near
here
excepting
farmer
brown
boy
and
we
told
you
he
would
hurt
he
brought
us
each
a
carrot
peter
rabbit
broke
in
eagerly
just
the
same
i
would
trust
him
replied
quack
where
is
he
now
he
left
ever
so
long
ago
and
he
wo
be
back
declared
peter
confidently
i
hope
not
said
quack
with
a
sigh
did
you
hear
the
bang
of
that
terrible
gun
just
after
i
left
here
yes
replied
jerry
muskrat
was
it
fired
at
you
quack
nodded
and
held
up
one
wing
peter
and
jerry
could
see
that
one
of
the
long
feathers
was
missing
i
thought
i
was
flying
high
enough
to
be
safe
said
she
but
when
i
reached
the
big
river
there
was
a
bang
from
the
bushes
on
the
bank
and
something
cut
that
feather
out
of
my
wing
and
i
felt
a
sharp
pain
in
my
side
it
made
me
feel
quite
ill
for
a
while
and
the
place
is
very
sore
now
but
i
guess
i
lucky
that
it
was
no
worse
it
is
very
hard
work
to
know
just
how
far
those
terrible
guns
can
throw
things
at
you
next
time
i
will
fly
where
have
you
been
since
you
left
us
asked
peter
eight
in
the
middle
of
the
big
river
replied
quack
it
was
the
only
safe
place
i
did
dare
go
near
either
shore
and
i
nearly
starved
i
have
had
a
mouthful
to
eat
peter
opened
his
mouth
to
tell
her
of
the
wheat
and
corn
left
by
farmer
brown
boy
and
then
closed
it
again
he
would
let
her
find
it
for
herself
if
he
told
her
about
it
she
might
suspect
a
trick
and
refuse
to
go
near
the
place
he
never
had
seen
any
one
so
suspicious
not
even
old
man
coyote
but
he
could
blame
her
after
all
she
had
been
through
so
he
kept
still
and
waited
he
was
learning
was
peter
rabbit
he
was
learning
a
great
deal
about
quack
viii
quack
has
a
good
meal
and
a
rest
there
nothing
like
a
stomach
full
to
make
the
heart
feel
light
to
chase
away
the
clouds
of
care
and
make
the
world
seem
bright
that
a
fact
a
full
stomach
makes
the
whole
world
seem
different
brighter
better
and
more
worth
living
in
it
is
the
hardest
kind
of
hard
work
to
be
cheerful
and
see
only
the
bright
side
of
things
when
your
stomach
is
empty
but
once
fill
that
empty
stomach
and
everything
is
changed
it
was
just
that
way
with
quack
for
days
at
a
time
she
had
had
a
full
stomach
because
of
the
hunters
with
their
terrible
guns
and
when
just
before
dark
that
night
she
returned
to
the
smiling
pool
her
stomach
was
quite
empty
i
do
suppose
i
find
much
to
eat
here
but
a
little
in
peace
and
safety
is
better
than
a
feast
with
worry
and
danger
said
she
swimming
over
to
the
brown
bulrushes
on
one
side
of
the
smiling
pool
and
appearing
to
stand
on
her
head
as
she
plunged
it
under
water
and
searched
in
the
mud
on
the
bottom
for
food
peter
rabbit
looked
over
at
jerry
muskrat
sitting
on
the
big
rock
and
jerry
winked
in
a
minute
up
bobbed
the
head
of
quack
and
there
was
both
a
pleased
and
a
worried
look
on
her
face
she
had
found
some
of
the
corn
left
there
by
farmer
brown
boy
at
once
she
swam
out
to
the
middle
of
the
smiling
pool
looking
suspiciously
this
way
and
that
way
there
is
corn
over
there
said
she
do
you
know
how
it
came
there
i
saw
farmer
brown
boy
throwing
something
over
there
replied
peter
did
we
tell
you
that
he
would
be
good
to
you
quack
quack
quack
i
seen
that
kind
of
kindness
too
often
to
be
fooled
by
it
snapped
quack
he
probably
saw
me
leave
in
a
hurry
and
put
this
corn
here
hoping
that
i
would
come
back
and
find
it
and
make
up
my
mind
to
stay
here
a
while
he
thinks
that
if
i
do
he
have
a
chance
to
hide
near
enough
to
shoot
me
i
did
believe
this
could
be
a
safe
place
for
me
and
now
i
know
it
i
stay
here
but
i
try
to
find
some
other
place
oh
dear
it
dreadful
not
to
have
any
place
at
all
to
feel
safe
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
peter
thought
of
the
dear
old
and
how
safe
he
always
felt
there
and
he
felt
a
great
pity
for
poor
quack
who
feel
safe
anywhere
and
then
right
away
he
grew
indignant
that
she
should
be
so
distrustful
of
farmer
brown
boy
though
if
he
had
stopped
to
think
he
would
have
remembered
that
once
he
was
just
as
distrustful
i
should
think
said
peter
with
a
great
deal
of
dignity
that
you
might
at
least
believe
what
jerry
muskrat
and
i
who
live
here
all
the
time
tell
you
we
ought
to
know
farmer
brown
boy
if
any
one
does
and
we
tell
you
that
he
wo
harm
a
feather
of
he
wo
get
the
chance
snapped
quack
jerry
muskrat
sniffed
in
disgust
i
do
doubt
you
have
suffered
a
lot
from
men
with
terrible
guns
said
he
but
you
do
suppose
peter
and
i
have
lived
as
long
as
we
have
without
learning
a
little
do
you
i
would
trust
many
of
those
creatures
myself
but
farmer
brown
boy
is
different
if
all
of
them
were
like
him
we
would
have
a
thing
to
fear
from
them
he
has
a
heart
yes
indeed
he
has
a
heart
now
you
take
my
advice
and
eat
whatever
he
has
put
there
for
you
be
thankful
and
stop
worrying
peter
and
i
will
keep
watch
and
warn
you
if
there
is
any
i
do
know
as
even
this
would
have
overcome
quack
fears
if
it
had
been
for
the
taste
of
that
good
corn
in
her
mouth
and
her
empty
stomach
she
could
she
just
could
resist
these
and
presently
she
was
back
among
the
rushes
hunting
out
the
corn
and
wheat
as
fast
as
ever
she
could
when
at
last
she
could
eat
no
more
she
felt
so
comfortable
that
somehow
the
smiling
pool
seem
such
a
dangerous
place
after
all
and
she
quite
forgot
farmer
brown
boy
she
found
a
snug
among
the
rushes
too
far
out
from
the
bank
for
reddy
fox
to
surprise
her
and
then
with
a
sleepy
good
night
to
jerry
and
peter
she
tucked
her
head
under
her
wing
and
soon
was
fast
asleep
peter
rabbit
tiptoed
away
and
then
he
hurried
to
the
dear
old
to
tell
peter
all
about
quack
ix
peter
rabbit
makes
an
early
call
peter
rabbit
was
so
full
of
interest
in
quack
and
her
troubles
that
he
was
back
at
the
smiling
pool
before
sun
had
kicked
off
his
rosy
blankets
and
begun
his
daily
climb
up
in
the
blue
blue
sky
you
see
he
felt
that
he
had
heard
only
a
part
of
story
and
he
was
dreadfully
afraid
that
she
would
get
away
before
he
could
hear
the
rest
with
the
first
bit
of
daylight
quack
swam
out
from
her
among
the
brown
rushes
it
looked
to
peter
as
if
she
sat
up
on
the
end
of
her
tail
as
she
stretched
her
neck
and
wings
just
as
far
as
she
could
and
he
wanted
to
laugh
right
out
then
she
quickly
ducked
her
head
under
water
two
or
three
times
so
that
the
water
rolled
down
over
her
back
and
again
peter
wanted
to
laugh
but
he
did
he
kept
perfectly
still
quack
shook
herself
and
then
began
to
carefully
dress
her
feathers
that
is
she
carefully
put
back
in
place
every
feather
that
had
been
rumpled
up
she
took
a
great
deal
of
time
for
this
for
quack
is
very
neat
and
tidy
and
takes
the
greatest
pride
in
looking
as
fine
as
she
can
of
course
it
was
very
impolite
of
peter
to
watch
her
make
her
toilet
but
he
did
think
of
that
he
did
mean
to
be
impolite
and
then
it
was
so
interesting
huh
said
he
to
himself
i
see
what
any
one
wants
to
waste
so
much
time
on
their
clothes
you
know
peter
does
waste
any
time
on
his
clothes
in
fact
he
does
seem
to
care
a
bit
how
he
looks
he
has
learned
yet
that
it
always
pays
to
be
as
neat
and
clean
as
possible
and
that
you
must
think
well
of
yourself
if
you
want
others
to
think
well
of
you
when
at
last
quack
had
taken
a
final
shower
bath
and
appeared
satisfied
that
she
was
looking
her
best
peter
opened
his
mouth
to
ask
her
the
questions
he
was
so
full
of
but
closed
it
again
as
he
remembered
people
are
usually
better
natured
when
their
stomachs
are
full
and
quack
had
not
yet
breakfasted
so
he
waited
as
patiently
as
he
could
which
was
patiently
at
all
at
last
quack
finished
her
breakfast
and
then
she
had
to
make
her
toilet
all
over
again
finally
peter
hopped
to
the
edge
of
the
bank
where
she
would
see
him
good
morning
quack
said
he
very
politely
i
hope
you
had
a
good
rest
and
are
feeling
very
well
this
thank
you
replied
quack
i
feeling
as
well
as
could
be
expected
in
fact
i
feeling
better
than
i
have
felt
for
some
time
in
spite
of
the
sore
place
made
by
that
terrible
gun
yesterday
you
see
i
have
had
a
good
rest
and
two
square
meals
and
these
are
things
i
have
had
since
goodness
knows
when
this
is
a
very
nice
place
let
me
see
what
is
it
you
call
it
the
smiling
pool
said
peter
that
a
good
name
for
it
returned
quack
if
only
i
could
be
sure
that
none
of
those
hunters
would
find
me
here
and
if
only
quack
were
here
i
would
be
content
to
stay
a
at
the
mention
of
quack
the
eyes
of
quack
suddenly
filled
with
tears
peter
felt
tears
of
sympathy
in
his
own
eyes
where
is
quack
he
asked
i
do
know
sobbed
quack
i
wish
i
did
i
have
seen
him
since
one
of
those
terrible
guns
was
fired
at
us
over
on
the
big
river
yesterday
morning
a
little
while
before
little
joe
otter
told
me
about
the
smiling
pool
ever
since
we
started
for
our
home
in
the
far
north
i
have
been
fearing
that
something
of
this
kind
might
happen
i
ought
to
be
on
my
way
there
now
but
what
is
the
use
without
quack
without
him
i
would
be
all
alone
up
there
and
would
have
any
wo
you
tell
me
all
that
has
happened
since
you
started
on
your
long
journey
asked
peter
perhaps
some
of
us
can
help
i
afraid
you
ca
replied
quack
sadly
but
i
tell
you
all
about
it
so
that
you
may
know
just
how
thankful
you
ought
to
feel
that
you
do
not
have
to
suffer
what
some
of
us
x
how
and
quack
started
north
peter
rabbit
was
eager
to
help
quack
in
her
trouble
though
he
had
the
least
idea
how
he
could
help
and
neither
had
she
how
any
one
who
dislikes
water
as
peter
does
could
help
one
who
lives
on
the
water
all
the
time
was
more
than
either
one
of
them
could
see
and
yet
without
knowing
it
peter
was
helping
quack
he
was
giving
her
his
sympathy
and
sympathy
often
helps
others
a
great
deal
more
than
we
even
guess
it
sometimes
is
a
very
good
plan
to
tell
your
troubles
to
some
one
who
will
listen
with
sympathy
it
was
so
with
quack
she
had
kept
her
troubles
locked
in
her
own
heart
so
long
that
it
did
her
good
to
pour
them
all
out
to
peter
mr
quack
and
i
spent
a
very
comfortable
winter
way
down
in
the
sunny
southland
said
she
with
a
look
it
was
very
warm
and
nice
down
there
and
there
were
a
great
many
other
ducks
spending
the
winter
with
us
the
place
where
we
were
was
far
from
the
homes
of
men
and
it
was
only
once
in
a
long
while
that
we
had
to
watch
out
for
terrible
guns
of
course
we
had
to
have
our
wits
with
us
all
the
time
because
there
are
hawks
and
owls
and
minks
down
there
just
as
there
are
up
here
but
any
duck
who
ca
keep
out
of
their
way
deserves
to
furnish
one
of
them
a
dinner
then
there
was
another
fellow
we
had
to
watch
out
for
a
queer
fellow
whom
we
never
see
anywhere
but
down
there
it
was
never
safe
to
swim
too
near
an
old
log
floating
in
the
water
or
lying
on
the
bank
because
it
might
suddenly
open
a
great
mouth
and
swallow
one
of
us
what
that
peter
rabbit
leaned
forward
and
stared
at
quack
with
his
eyes
popping
right
out
what
that
he
repeated
how
can
an
old
log
have
a
mouth
quack
just
had
to
smile
peter
was
so
in
earnest
and
looked
so
astonished
of
course
said
she
no
really
truly
log
has
a
mouth
or
is
alive
but
this
queer
fellow
i
was
speaking
of
looks
so
much
like
an
old
log
floating
in
the
water
unless
you
look
at
him
very
sharply
that
many
a
heedless
young
duck
has
discovered
the
difference
when
it
was
too
late
then
too
he
will
swim
under
water
and
come
up
underneath
and
seize
you
without
any
warning
he
has
the
biggest
mouth
i
ever
seen
with
teeth
and
could
swallow
me
illustration
with
caption
some
folks
call
him
alligator
and
some
just
by
this
time
peter
eyes
looked
as
if
they
would
fall
out
of
his
head
what
is
his
name
whispered
peter
it
old
ally
the
replied
quack
some
folks
call
him
alligator
and
some
just
but
we
call
him
old
ally
he
a
very
interesting
old
fellow
some
time
perhaps
i
tell
you
more
about
him
quack
and
i
kept
out
of
his
reach
you
may
be
sure
we
lived
quietly
and
tried
to
get
in
as
good
condition
as
possible
for
the
long
journey
back
to
our
home
in
the
north
when
it
was
time
to
start
a
lot
of
us
got
together
just
as
we
did
when
we
came
down
from
the
north
only
this
time
the
young
ducks
felt
themselves
quite
grown
up
in
fact
before
we
started
there
was
a
great
deal
of
and
each
one
chose
a
mate
that
was
a
very
happy
time
a
very
happy
time
indeed
but
it
was
a
sad
time
too
for
us
older
ducks
because
we
knew
what
dreadful
things
were
likely
to
happen
on
the
long
journey
it
is
hard
enough
to
lose
father
or
mother
or
brother
or
sister
but
it
is
worse
to
lose
a
dear
quack
eyes
suddenly
filled
with
tears
again
oh
dear
she
sobbed
i
wish
i
knew
what
became
of
peter
said
nothing
but
looked
the
sympathy
he
felt
presently
quack
went
on
with
her
story
we
had
a
splendid
big
flock
when
we
started
made
up
wholly
of
pairs
each
pair
dreaming
of
the
home
they
would
build
when
they
reached
the
far
north
quack
was
the
leader
as
usual
and
i
flew
right
behind
him
we
had
gone
far
before
we
began
to
hear
the
terrible
guns
and
the
farther
we
went
the
worse
they
got
quack
led
us
to
the
safest
feeding
and
resting
grounds
he
knew
of
and
for
a
time
our
flock
escaped
the
terrible
guns
but
the
farther
we
went
the
more
guns
there
quack
paused
and
peter
waited
xi
the
terrible
terrible
guns
bang
bang
bang
not
a
feather
spare
kill
kill
kill
wound
and
rip
and
tear
that
is
what
the
terrible
guns
roar
from
morning
to
night
at
quack
and
her
friends
as
they
fly
on
their
long
journey
to
their
home
in
the
far
north
i
do
wonder
that
she
was
terribly
uneasy
and
nervous
as
she
sat
in
the
smiling
pool
talking
to
peter
rabbit
do
you
yes
said
she
continuing
her
story
of
her
long
journey
from
the
sunny
southland
where
she
had
spent
the
winter
the
farther
we
got
the
more
there
were
of
those
terrible
guns
it
grew
so
bad
that
as
well
as
quack
knew
the
places
where
we
could
find
food
and
no
duck
that
ever
flew
knew
them
better
he
could
find
one
where
we
could
feel
perfectly
sure
that
we
were
safe
the
very
places
sometimes
were
the
most
dangerous
if
you
saw
a
lot
of
rabbits
playing
together
on
the
green
meadows
you
would
feel
perfectly
safe
in
joining
them
would
you
peter
nodded
i
certainly
would
said
he
if
it
was
safe
for
them
it
certainly
would
be
safe
for
well
that
is
just
the
way
we
felt
when
we
saw
a
lot
of
ducks
swimming
about
on
the
edge
of
one
of
those
we
were
tired
for
we
had
flown
a
long
distance
and
we
were
hungry
it
was
still
and
peaceful
there
and
not
a
thing
to
be
seen
that
looked
the
least
bit
like
danger
so
we
went
straight
in
to
join
those
ducks
and
then
just
as
we
set
our
wings
to
drop
down
on
the
water
among
them
there
was
a
terrible
bang
bang
bang
bang
my
heart
almost
stopped
beating
then
how
we
did
fly
when
we
were
far
out
over
the
water
where
we
could
see
that
nothing
was
near
us
we
stopped
to
rest
and
there
we
found
only
half
as
many
in
our
flock
as
there
had
where
were
the
others
asked
peter
although
he
guessed
killed
or
hurt
by
those
terrible
guns
replied
quack
sadly
and
that
was
the
worst
of
it
i
told
you
that
when
we
started
each
of
us
had
a
mate
now
we
found
that
of
those
who
had
escaped
four
had
lost
their
mates
they
were
heartbroken
when
it
came
time
for
us
to
move
on
they
would
go
they
said
that
if
they
did
reach
the
in
the
far
north
they
could
have
nests
or
eggs
or
young
because
they
had
no
mates
so
what
was
the
use
besides
they
hoped
that
if
they
waited
around
they
might
find
their
mates
they
thought
they
might
not
have
been
killed
but
just
hurt
and
might
be
able
to
get
away
from
those
hunters
so
they
left
us
and
swam
back
towards
that
terrible
place
calling
for
their
lost
mates
and
it
was
the
saddest
sound
i
know
now
just
how
they
felt
for
i
have
lost
quack
and
that
why
i
quack
drew
a
wing
across
her
eyes
to
wipe
away
the
tears
but
what
happened
to
those
ducks
that
were
swimming
about
there
and
made
you
think
it
was
safe
asked
peter
with
a
puzzled
look
on
his
face
nothing
replied
quack
they
had
been
fastened
out
there
in
the
water
by
the
hunters
so
as
to
make
us
think
it
safe
and
the
terrible
guns
were
fired
at
us
and
not
at
them
the
hunters
were
hidden
under
grass
and
that
is
why
we
did
see
peter
blinked
his
eyes
rapidly
as
if
he
were
having
hard
work
to
believe
what
he
had
been
told
why
said
he
at
last
i
never
heard
of
anything
so
dreadfully
unfair
in
all
my
life
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
those
hunters
actually
made
other
ducks
lead
you
into
danger
that
just
what
i
mean
returned
quack
those
creatures
do
know
what
fairness
is
why
some
of
them
have
learned
our
language
and
actually
call
us
in
where
they
can
shoot
us
just
think
of
that
they
tell
us
in
our
own
language
that
there
is
plenty
to
eat
and
all
is
safe
so
that
we
will
think
that
other
ducks
are
hidden
and
feeding
there
and
then
when
we
go
to
join
them
we
are
shot
at
you
ought
to
be
mighty
thankful
peter
rabbit
that
you
are
not
a
i
am
replied
peter
he
knew
that
not
one
of
the
meadow
and
forest
people
who
were
always
trying
to
catch
him
would
do
a
thing
like
that
it
all
true
said
quack
and
those
hunters
do
other
things
just
as
unfair
sometimes
awful
storms
will
come
up
and
we
just
have
to
find
places
where
we
can
rest
those
hunters
will
hide
near
those
places
and
shoot
at
us
when
we
are
so
tired
that
we
can
hardly
move
a
wing
it
would
be
so
bad
if
a
hunter
would
be
satisfied
to
kill
just
one
duck
just
as
reddy
fox
is
but
he
seems
to
want
to
kill
every
duck
foxes
and
hawks
and
owls
catch
a
good
many
young
ducks
just
as
they
do
young
rabbits
but
you
know
how
we
feel
about
that
they
only
hunt
when
they
are
hungry
and
they
hunt
fairly
when
they
have
got
enough
to
make
a
dinner
they
stop
they
keep
our
wits
sharp
if
we
do
not
keep
out
of
their
way
it
is
our
own
fault
it
is
a
kind
of
game
the
game
of
life
i
guess
it
is
old
mother
nature
way
of
keeping
us
and
sharpening
our
wits
and
so
making
us
better
fitted
to
live
with
these
creatures
with
terrible
guns
it
is
all
different
we
do
have
any
chance
at
all
if
they
hunted
us
as
reddy
fox
does
tried
to
catch
us
themselves
it
would
be
different
but
their
terrible
guns
kill
when
we
are
a
long
way
off
and
there
is
any
way
for
us
to
know
of
the
danger
and
then
when
one
of
them
does
kill
a
duck
he
is
satisfied
but
keeps
on
killing
and
killing
and
killing
i
sure
one
would
make
him
a
dinner
if
that
is
what
he
wants
and
they
often
simply
break
the
wings
or
otherwise
terribly
hurt
the
ones
they
shoot
at
and
then
leave
them
to
suffer
unable
to
take
care
of
themselves
oh
dear
i
afraid
that
is
what
has
happened
to
once
more
poor
quack
was
quite
overcome
with
her
troubles
and
sorrows
peter
wished
with
all
his
heart
that
he
could
do
something
to
comfort
her
but
of
course
he
could
so
he
just
sat
still
and
waited
until
she
could
tell
him
just
what
did
happen
to
quack
xii
what
did
happen
to
quack
when
did
you
last
see
quack
asked
jerry
muskrat
who
had
been
listening
while
quack
told
peter
rabbit
about
her
terrible
journey
early
yesterday
morning
replied
quack
the
tears
once
more
filling
her
eyes
we
had
reached
the
big
river
over
there
just
six
of
us
out
of
the
big
flock
that
had
started
from
the
sunny
southland
how
we
got
as
far
as
that
i
do
know
but
we
did
and
neither
quack
nor
i
had
lost
a
feather
from
those
terrible
guns
that
had
banged
at
us
all
the
way
up
and
that
had
killed
so
many
of
our
friends
we
were
flying
up
the
big
river
and
everything
seemed
perfectly
safe
we
were
in
a
hurry
and
when
we
came
to
a
bend
in
the
big
river
we
flew
quite
close
to
shore
so
as
not
to
have
to
go
way
out
and
around
that
was
where
quack
made
a
mistake
even
the
smartest
people
will
make
mistakes
sometimes
you
peter
rabbit
nodded
i
know
said
he
i
made
them
and
then
he
wondered
why
jerry
muskrat
laughed
right
out
yes
continued
quack
that
is
where
quack
made
a
mistake
a
great
mistake
i
suppose
that
because
not
a
single
gun
had
been
fired
at
us
that
morning
he
thought
perhaps
there
were
no
hunters
on
the
big
river
so
to
save
time
he
led
us
close
to
shore
and
then
it
happened
there
was
a
bang
bang
of
a
terrible
gun
and
down
fell
quack
just
as
we
had
seen
so
many
fall
before
it
was
awful
there
was
quack
flying
in
front
of
me
on
swift
strong
wings
and
there
never
was
a
swifter
stronger
flier
or
a
handsomer
duck
than
quack
and
then
all
in
the
wink
of
an
eye
he
was
tumbling
helplessly
down
down
to
the
water
below
and
i
was
flying
on
alone
for
the
other
ducks
turned
off
and
i
do
know
what
became
of
them
i
could
stop
to
see
what
became
of
quack
because
if
i
had
that
terrible
gun
would
have
killed
me
so
i
kept
on
a
little
way
and
then
turned
and
went
back
only
i
kept
out
in
the
middle
of
the
big
river
i
dropped
down
on
the
water
and
swam
about
calling
and
calling
but
i
did
get
any
answer
and
so
i
do
know
what
has
become
of
quack
i
am
afraid
he
was
killed
and
if
he
was
i
wish
i
had
been
killed
here
quack
choked
up
so
that
she
could
say
another
word
peter
own
eyes
were
full
of
tears
as
he
tried
to
comfort
her
perhaps
said
he
mr
quack
was
killed
and
is
hiding
somewhere
along
the
big
river
i
do
know
why
i
feel
so
but
i
feel
sure
that
he
was
killed
and
that
you
will
find
him
that
why
i
waited
instead
of
going
on
replied
quack
between
sobs
though
it
would
have
been
of
any
use
to
go
on
without
my
dear
mate
i
going
back
to
the
big
river
now
to
look
for
him
the
trouble
is
i
do
dare
go
near
the
shore
and
if
he
is
alive
he
probably
is
hiding
somewhere
among
the
rushes
along
the
banks
i
think
i
be
going
along
now
but
i
be
back
if
nothing
happens
to
me
you
folks
who
can
always
stay
at
home
have
a
great
deal
to
be
thankful
it
lucky
for
me
that
peter
was
here
to
hear
her
say
that
said
peter
as
he
and
jerry
muskrat
watched
quack
fly
swiftly
towards
the
big
river
mrs
peter
is
forever
worrying
and
scolding
because
i
do
stay
in
the
dear
old
if
she
had
heard
quack
say
that
i
never
would
have
heard
the
last
of
it
i
wish
there
was
something
we
could
do
for
quack
going
back
to
the
dear
old
to
think
it
over
and
i
guess
the
sooner
i
start
the
better
for
that
looks
to
me
like
reddy
fox
over
there
and
he
headed
this
so
off
for
home
started
peter
as
fast
as
he
could
go
and
all
the
way
there
he
was
turning
over
in
his
mind
what
quack
had
told
him
and
trying
to
think
of
some
way
to
help
her
xiii
peter
tells
about
quack
to
get
things
done
if
you
but
try
you
always
find
there
is
a
way
what
you
yourself
ca
do
alone
the
chances
are
another
may
when
peter
rabbit
was
once
more
safely
back
in
the
dear
old
he
told
peter
all
about
poor
quack
and
her
troubles
then
for
a
long
long
time
he
sat
in
a
brown
study
a
brown
study
you
know
is
sitting
perfectly
still
and
thinking
very
hard
that
was
what
peter
did
he
sat
so
still
that
if
you
had
happened
along
you
probably
would
have
thought
him
asleep
but
he
was
asleep
no
indeed
he
was
just
thinking
and
thinking
he
was
trying
to
think
of
some
way
to
help
quack
at
last
he
gave
a
little
sigh
of
disappointment
illustration
with
caption
just
tuck
that
fact
away
in
that
empty
head
of
yours
and
never
say
it
ca
be
done
said
he
there
is
any
what
ca
be
done
demanded
a
voice
right
over
his
head
peter
looked
up
there
sat
sammy
jay
peter
had
been
thinking
so
hard
that
he
had
seen
sammy
arrive
what
ca
be
done
repeated
sammy
there
is
anything
that
ca
be
done
there
are
plenty
of
things
that
you
ca
do
but
what
you
ca
do
some
one
else
can
just
tuck
that
fact
away
in
that
empty
head
of
yours
and
never
say
you
know
sammy
dearly
loves
to
tease
peter
peter
made
a
face
at
sammy
which
means
i
suppose
that
what
i
ca
do
you
can
you
always
did
have
a
pretty
good
opinion
of
yourself
sammy
said
he
nothing
of
the
kind
retorted
sammy
i
simply
mean
that
nobody
can
do
everything
and
that
very
often
two
heads
are
better
than
one
it
struck
me
that
you
had
something
on
your
mind
and
i
thought
i
might
be
able
to
help
you
get
rid
of
it
but
of
course
if
you
do
want
my
help
supposing
i
could
and
would
give
it
to
you
that
is
an
end
of
the
matter
and
i
guess
i
be
on
my
way
the
old
is
rather
a
dull
place
peter
started
to
make
a
sharp
retort
but
thought
better
of
it
instead
he
replied
mildly
i
was
just
trying
to
think
of
some
way
to
help
poor
help
quack
exclaimed
sammy
in
surprise
where
under
the
sun
did
you
get
acquainted
with
quack
what
the
matter
with
her
she
always
has
looked
to
me
quite
able
to
help
well
she
is
that
is
she
needs
others
to
help
her
just
now
replied
peter
and
i
been
most
thinking
my
head
off
trying
to
find
a
way
to
help
then
he
told
sammy
how
he
had
met
quack
at
the
smiling
pool
and
how
terrible
her
long
journey
up
from
the
sunny
southland
had
been
and
how
quack
had
been
shot
by
a
hunter
with
a
terrible
gun
and
how
poor
quack
was
quite
heartbroken
and
how
she
had
gone
over
to
the
big
river
to
look
for
him
but
did
dare
go
near
the
places
where
he
might
be
hiding
if
he
were
still
alive
and
hurt
so
that
he
could
fly
and
how
cruel
and
terribly
unfair
were
the
men
with
terrible
guns
and
all
the
other
things
he
had
learned
from
quack
sammy
listened
with
his
head
cocked
on
one
side
and
for
once
he
did
interrupt
peter
or
try
to
tease
him
or
make
fun
of
him
in
fact
as
peter
looked
up
at
him
he
could
see
that
sammy
was
very
serious
and
thoughtful
and
that
the
more
he
heard
of
story
the
more
thoughtful
he
looked
when
peter
finished
sammy
flew
down
a
little
nearer
to
peter
i
beg
your
pardon
for
saying
your
head
is
empty
peter
said
he
your
heart
is
right
anyway
of
course
there
is
anything
you
can
do
to
help
quack
but
as
i
told
you
in
the
beginning
what
you
ca
do
others
can
now
i
do
say
that
i
can
help
quack
but
i
can
try
i
believe
i
do
a
little
thinking
so
sammy
jay
in
his
turn
went
into
a
brown
study
and
peter
watched
him
anxiously
and
a
little
hopefully
xiv
sammy
jay
plan
to
help
quack
sammy
jay
sat
on
the
lowest
branch
of
a
little
tree
in
the
dear
old
just
over
peter
rabbit
head
thinking
as
hard
as
ever
he
could
peter
watched
him
and
wondered
if
sammy
would
be
able
to
think
of
any
plan
for
helping
poor
quack
he
hoped
so
he
himself
had
thought
and
thought
until
he
felt
as
if
his
brains
were
all
mixed
up
and
he
could
think
any
more
so
he
watched
sammy
and
waited
and
hoped
presently
sammy
flirted
his
wings
in
a
way
which
peter
knew
meant
that
he
had
made
up
his
mind
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
quack
said
that
if
quack
is
alive
he
probably
is
hiding
among
the
rushes
along
the
banks
of
the
big
river
he
asked
peter
nodded
and
that
she
said
that
she
does
dare
go
near
the
banks
because
of
fear
of
the
terrible
guns
again
peter
nodded
well
if
that
the
case
what
is
the
matter
with
some
of
us
who
are
not
afraid
of
the
terrible
guns
looking
for
quack
said
sammy
i
will
for
one
and
i
quite
sure
that
my
cousin
blacky
the
crow
will
for
another
he
surely
will
if
he
thinks
it
will
spoil
the
plans
of
any
hunters
blacky
would
go
a
long
distance
to
do
that
he
hates
terrible
guns
and
the
men
who
use
them
and
he
knows
all
about
them
he
has
very
sharp
eyes
has
blacky
and
he
knows
when
a
man
has
got
a
gun
and
when
he
has
more
than
that
he
can
tell
better
than
any
one
i
know
of
just
how
near
he
can
safely
go
to
one
of
those
terrible
guns
he
is
smart
my
cousin
blacky
is
and
if
he
will
help
me
look
for
quack
we
find
him
if
he
is
that
will
be
splendid
cried
peter
clapping
his
hands
but
are
you
afraid
of
those
terrible
guns
sammy
not
when
the
hunters
are
trying
for
ducks
replied
sammy
if
there
is
a
duck
anywhere
in
sight
they
wo
shoot
at
poor
little
me
or
even
at
blacky
though
they
would
shoot
at
him
any
other
time
you
see
they
know
that
shooting
at
us
would
frighten
the
ducks
blacky
knows
all
about
the
big
river
in
the
winter
he
often
gets
considerable
of
his
food
along
its
banks
i
been
over
there
a
number
of
times
but
i
do
know
so
much
about
it
as
he
does
now
here
is
my
plan
i
go
find
blacky
and
tell
him
all
about
what
we
want
to
do
for
quack
then
when
quack
comes
back
to
the
smiling
pool
if
she
has
found
quack
we
tell
her
what
we
are
going
to
do
and
what
she
must
do
she
must
swim
right
up
the
big
river
keeping
out
in
the
middle
where
she
will
be
safe
if
there
are
any
hunters
hiding
along
the
bank
they
will
see
her
and
then
they
wo
shoot
at
blacky
or
me
because
they
will
keep
hoping
that
quack
will
swim
in
near
enough
for
them
to
shoot
her
blacky
will
fly
along
over
one
bank
of
the
big
river
and
i
will
do
the
same
over
the
other
bank
keeping
as
nearly
opposite
quack
as
we
can
being
up
in
the
air
that
way
and
looking
down
we
will
be
able
to
see
the
hunters
and
also
quack
if
he
is
hiding
among
the
rushes
are
you
quite
sure
that
quack
will
come
back
to
the
smiling
pool
she
said
she
would
replied
peter
last
night
she
came
just
a
little
while
before
dark
and
i
think
she
will
do
the
same
thing
to
see
if
any
more
corn
has
been
left
for
her
you
know
farmer
brown
boy
put
some
there
yesterday
and
it
tasted
so
good
to
her
that
i
do
believe
she
will
be
able
to
stay
away
even
if
she
wants
to
i
think
your
plan
is
perfectly
splendid
sammy
jay
i
do
hope
blacky
the
crow
will
he
will
do
worry
about
that
replied
sammy
hello
there
goes
farmer
brown
boy
over
to
the
smiling
pool
then
there
will
be
some
more
corn
for
quack
i
just
know
it
cried
peter
he
is
going
to
see
if
quack
is
there
and
i
just
know
he
has
his
pockets
full
of
i
would
mind
a
little
of
it
myself
said
sammy
well
i
must
go
along
to
hunt
up
blacky
and
good
luck
replied
peter
i
always
said
you
are
not
half
such
a
bad
fellow
as
you
try
to
make
folks
think
you
are
sammy
thanks
said
sammy
and
started
for
the
green
forest
to
look
for
his
cousin
blacky
the
crow
xv
the
hunt
for
quack
in
spite
of
her
hopelessness
in
regard
to
quack
there
is
no
doubt
that
quack
felt
better
that
night
after
she
had
eaten
the
corn
left
among
the
rushes
of
the
smiling
pool
by
farmer
boy
now
she
had
that
very
comfortable
feeling
that
goes
with
a
full
stomach
she
could
think
better
as
the
black
shadows
crept
across
the
smiling
pool
she
turned
over
in
her
mind
sammy
plan
for
helping
her
the
next
day
the
more
she
thought
about
it
the
better
it
seemed
and
she
began
to
feel
a
little
ashamed
that
she
had
not
appeared
more
grateful
to
sammy
when
he
told
her
at
the
time
she
had
been
tired
and
hungry
and
discouraged
now
she
was
beginning
to
feel
rested
and
she
was
no
longer
hungry
these
things
made
all
the
difference
in
the
world
as
she
thought
over
sammy
plan
she
began
to
feel
a
little
hope
and
when
at
last
she
put
her
head
under
her
wing
to
go
to
sleep
she
had
made
up
her
mind
that
the
plan
was
worth
trying
and
that
she
would
do
her
part
bright
and
early
the
next
morning
sammy
jay
and
blacky
the
crow
were
in
the
big
near
the
smiling
pool
ready
to
start
for
the
big
river
to
hunt
for
quack
peter
rabbit
had
been
so
afraid
that
he
would
miss
something
that
he
had
stayed
near
the
smiling
pool
all
night
so
he
was
on
hand
to
see
the
start
it
had
been
agreed
that
quack
was
to
go
to
a
certain
place
on
the
big
river
and
then
swim
up
as
far
as
she
thought
it
would
be
of
any
use
she
was
to
stay
in
the
middle
of
the
river
where
she
would
be
quite
safe
from
hunters
with
terrible
guns
and
where
also
these
same
hunters
would
be
sure
to
see
her
and
so
not
be
tempted
to
shoot
at
blacky
the
crow
if
he
happened
to
fly
over
them
you
see
they
would
hope
that
quack
would
swim
in
near
enough
to
be
shot
and
so
would
not
risk
frightening
her
by
shooting
at
blacky
when
quack
had
finished
her
breakfast
she
started
for
the
big
river
and
her
stout
wings
moved
so
swiftly
that
they
made
a
whistling
sound
sammy
jay
and
blacky
the
crow
followed
her
but
though
they
flew
as
fast
as
they
could
quack
had
reached
the
big
river
before
they
had
gone
half
the
way
when
they
did
get
there
they
saw
quack
out
in
the
middle
swimming
about
and
watching
for
them
blacky
flew
across
the
river
and
pretended
to
be
hunting
for
food
along
the
farther
bank
just
as
every
hunter
knows
he
often
does
sammy
jay
did
the
same
thing
on
the
other
bank
quack
swam
slowly
up
the
big
river
keeping
in
the
middle
and
blacky
and
sammy
followed
along
up
the
two
banks
all
the
time
using
their
sharp
eyes
for
all
they
were
worth
to
find
quack
hiding
among
the
rushes
or
under
the
bushes
in
the
water
for
the
big
river
had
overflowed
its
banks
and
in
some
places
bushes
and
trees
were
in
the
water
now
sammy
jay
dearly
loves
to
hunt
for
things
whenever
he
knows
that
one
of
his
neighbors
in
the
green
forest
has
hidden
something
he
likes
to
hunt
for
it
it
is
so
much
that
he
wants
what
has
been
hidden
as
it
is
that
he
wants
to
feel
he
is
smart
enough
to
find
it
when
he
does
find
it
he
usually
steals
it
i
sorry
to
say
but
it
is
the
fun
of
hunting
that
sammy
enjoys
most
so
now
sammy
thoroughly
enjoyed
hunting
for
quack
he
peered
into
every
likely
and
became
so
interested
that
he
quite
forgot
about
the
hunters
who
might
be
waiting
along
the
bank
so
it
happened
that
he
did
see
a
boat
drawn
in
among
the
bushes
until
he
was
right
over
it
sitting
in
it
was
a
man
with
a
terrible
gun
very
intently
watching
quack
out
in
the
middle
of
the
big
river
sammy
was
so
startled
that
before
he
thought
he
opened
his
mouth
and
screamed
thief
thief
thief
at
the
top
of
his
lungs
and
flew
away
with
all
his
might
quack
heard
his
scream
and
understood
just
what
it
meant
a
little
later
blacky
the
crow
discovered
another
hunter
hiding
behind
the
bushes
on
his
side
caw
caw
caw
shouted
blacky
flying
out
over
the
water
far
enough
to
be
safe
from
that
terrible
gun
he
could
see
quack
quack
replied
quack
which
meant
that
she
understood
and
so
the
hunt
went
on
without
a
sign
of
poor
quack
xvi
sammy
jay
sees
something
green
for
all
their
peeking
and
peering
among
the
rushes
and
under
the
bushes
along
the
banks
of
the
big
river
and
no
sharper
eyes
ever
peeked
and
peered
sammy
jay
and
blacky
the
crow
had
found
no
sign
of
the
missing
quack
i
guess
quack
was
right
and
that
quack
was
killed
when
he
was
shot
muttered
sammy
to
himself
probably
one
of
those
hunters
had
him
for
dinner
long
ago
hello
there
another
hunter
up
where
the
laughing
brook
joins
the
big
river
i
guess
i
take
any
chances
i
like
to
find
quack
but
sammy
jay
is
a
lot
more
important
to
me
than
quack
and
that
fellow
just
might
happen
to
take
it
into
his
head
to
shoot
at
so
sammy
silently
flew
around
back
of
the
hunter
and
stopped
in
a
tree
where
he
could
watch
all
that
the
man
did
for
some
time
sammy
sat
there
watching
the
hunter
was
sitting
behind
a
sort
of
fence
of
bushes
which
quite
hid
him
from
any
one
who
might
happen
to
be
out
on
the
big
river
but
of
course
sammy
could
see
him
perfectly
because
he
was
behind
him
out
in
front
of
that
little
fence
which
was
on
the
very
edge
of
the
water
were
a
number
of
what
sammy
at
first
took
to
be
some
of
quack
relatives
why
he
shoot
them
thought
sammy
he
puzzled
over
this
as
he
watched
them
until
suddenly
it
came
into
his
head
that
he
had
seen
one
of
them
move
since
he
began
watching
them
the
man
changed
his
position
and
still
those
ducks
did
move
although
some
of
them
were
so
near
that
they
simply
could
have
helped
knowing
when
the
hunter
moved
unless
they
were
more
stupid
than
any
one
of
acquaintance
this
was
very
curious
very
curious
indeed
sammy
flew
a
little
nearer
and
then
a
little
nearer
taking
the
greatest
care
not
to
make
a
sound
pretty
soon
he
was
so
near
that
he
could
see
those
ducks
very
plainly
and
he
stared
with
all
his
might
he
see
any
feathers
no
sir
he
could
see
any
feathers
then
he
understood
huh
said
he
to
himself
those
are
not
ducks
at
all
they
are
just
pieces
of
wood
made
to
look
like
ducks
now
i
wonder
what
they
are
in
a
few
minutes
he
found
out
he
saw
the
hunter
crouch
down
a
little
lower
and
look
down
the
big
river
sammy
looked
too
he
saw
a
flock
of
real
ducks
flying
swiftly
just
above
the
middle
of
the
big
river
suddenly
the
leader
turned
straight
towards
the
place
where
the
hunter
was
hiding
and
the
others
followed
him
he
could
hear
quack
calling
excitedly
out
in
the
middle
of
the
big
river
but
the
strangers
did
not
heed
her
they
had
their
eyes
on
those
wooden
ducks
and
were
coming
straight
in
to
join
them
they
think
they
are
real
ducks
and
so
this
place
is
perfectly
safe
thought
sammy
he
saw
the
hunter
make
ready
to
shoot
with
his
terrible
gun
and
then
without
stopping
to
think
what
might
happen
to
him
he
opened
his
mouth
and
screamed
at
the
top
of
his
voice
he
saw
the
ducks
suddenly
swing
out
towards
the
middle
of
the
big
river
and
knew
that
they
had
heard
his
warning
he
saw
the
hunter
suddenly
rise
and
point
his
gun
at
the
flying
ducks
he
heard
the
bang
bang
of
the
terrible
gun
but
not
one
of
the
flock
was
hit
the
distance
was
too
great
sammy
chuckled
happily
then
he
remembered
that
he
himself
was
within
easy
reach
of
that
terrible
gun
and
probably
the
hunter
was
very
angry
in
great
fright
sammy
turned
and
flew
dodging
behind
trees
and
every
second
expecting
to
hear
again
the
roar
of
that
terrible
gun
but
he
did
and
so
when
he
thought
he
was
safe
he
stopped
now
in
flying
away
from
the
hunter
he
had
followed
the
laughing
brook
where
it
winds
through
a
sort
of
swamp
before
it
joins
the
big
river
because
there
was
more
water
than
could
be
kept
between
the
banks
of
the
big
river
it
had
crept
over
the
banks
and
all
the
trees
of
the
swamp
were
standing
in
water
just
beyond
where
sammy
was
sitting
was
a
pile
of
brush
in
the
water
a
jolly
little
sunbeam
dancing
down
through
the
tree
tops
touched
something
under
the
edge
of
the
brush
and
sammy
sharp
eyes
caught
a
flash
of
green
idly
he
watched
it
and
presently
it
moved
instantly
sammy
was
all
curiosity
he
flew
over
where
he
could
see
better
now
what
can
that
be
thought
sammy
as
he
peered
down
at
the
pile
of
brush
and
tried
to
see
under
it
xvii
quack
is
found
at
last
sammy
jay
eyes
sparkled
as
he
watched
that
spot
of
green
under
the
pile
of
brush
in
the
swamp
through
which
the
laughing
brook
finds
its
way
to
join
the
big
river
all
around
was
water
for
you
know
it
was
spring
and
the
melting
snows
on
the
hills
way
up
where
the
big
river
has
its
beginning
were
pouring
more
water
into
the
big
river
than
its
banks
would
hold
as
it
hurried
down
to
the
great
ocean
it
just
could
hurry
fast
enough
to
take
all
that
water
down
as
fast
as
it
ran
into
the
big
river
and
so
the
water
had
crept
over
the
banks
in
places
it
had
done
this
right
here
in
the
little
swamp
where
sammy
was
sammy
sat
perfectly
still
for
he
learned
long
ago
that
only
by
keeping
perfectly
still
may
one
see
all
that
is
to
be
seen
that
green
spot
had
moved
he
was
sure
of
that
and
if
it
moved
it
must
be
something
alive
if
it
were
alive
it
must
be
somebody
and
sammy
wanted
to
know
who
it
was
try
as
he
would
he
remember
any
one
who
wore
such
glossy
green
as
that
so
he
sat
perfectly
still
for
he
knew
that
if
whoever
was
hiding
under
that
brush
should
even
guess
that
he
was
being
watched
he
would
not
come
out
so
his
eyes
sparkling
with
excitement
sammy
watched
he
was
impatiently
patient
did
you
know
that
it
is
possible
to
be
impatiently
patient
well
it
is
sammy
was
just
boiling
with
impatience
inside
but
he
did
let
that
impatience
spoil
the
patience
of
his
waiting
he
sat
there
just
as
still
as
still
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
that
green
spot
and
you
would
never
have
guessed
that
he
was
fairly
bursting
with
impatience
to
know
who
it
was
he
was
watching
that
is
what
is
called
it
means
the
power
to
make
yourself
do
a
certain
thing
no
matter
how
much
you
may
want
to
do
something
else
it
is
a
splendid
thing
to
have
is
after
what
seemed
to
sammy
a
very
long
time
the
green
spot
moved
again
little
by
little
something
reached
out
from
under
the
pile
of
brush
it
was
a
head
a
very
beautiful
green
head
and
it
was
exactly
like
quack
head
only
hers
was
a
sober
brown
instead
of
green
sammy
choked
back
a
little
gasp
of
surprise
as
a
sudden
thought
popped
into
his
head
could
this
be
the
lost
quack
he
had
forgotten
that
probably
quack
dressed
differently
from
quack
and
so
of
course
he
had
been
looking
for
some
one
all
in
brown
there
was
the
bang
of
a
gun
somewhere
over
on
the
big
river
and
the
green
head
was
hastily
withdrawn
under
the
bush
but
not
before
sammy
had
seen
a
look
of
terrible
fear
in
his
eyes
i
believe
it
is
quack
thought
sammy
if
it
is
i
have
the
best
news
ever
to
tell
quack
just
trust
sammy
jay
to
find
anything
he
goes
looking
this
was
just
plain
boasting
and
sammy
knew
it
but
sammy
always
does
have
a
good
opinion
of
himself
it
is
one
of
his
faults
he
quite
lost
sight
of
the
fact
that
it
was
entirely
by
accident
that
he
had
come
over
to
this
swamp
now
that
he
had
guessed
who
this
might
be
he
was
less
impatient
he
waited
as
still
as
you
please
and
at
last
the
green
head
was
slowly
stretched
out
again
and
sammy
could
see
that
the
neck
was
green
too
and
that
around
the
neck
was
a
white
collar
sammy
could
keep
still
no
longer
illustration
with
caption
yes
said
he
in
a
low
voice
i
am
are
you
quack
he
asked
eagerly
the
beautiful
head
disappeared
like
a
flash
sammy
waited
a
minute
or
two
before
he
repeated
his
question
adding
you
need
be
afraid
there
is
anybody
here
but
me
and
i
your
friend
i
just
want
to
know
if
you
are
quack
because
i
been
looking
for
you
for
quack
are
you
slowly
looking
this
way
and
that
way
with
fear
and
suspicion
in
his
eyes
a
handsome
duck
came
out
from
under
the
pile
of
brush
yes
said
he
in
a
low
voice
i
am
quack
where
is
quack
safe
and
sound
over
on
the
big
river
replied
sammy
joyfully
oh
i
so
glad
i
found
you
xviii
sammy
jay
sends
quack
to
the
swamp
when
sammy
jay
left
quack
in
the
swamp
over
by
the
bank
of
the
big
river
he
flew
straight
back
to
the
smiling
pool
at
first
he
thought
of
flying
out
over
the
big
river
and
screaming
the
news
to
quack
who
you
know
was
swimming
about
out
there
but
he
knew
that
if
he
did
she
would
very
likely
fly
right
over
where
quack
was
and
that
would
do
at
all
no
indeed
that
do
at
all
one
of
the
hunters
would
be
sure
to
see
her
so
sammy
wisely
flew
back
to
the
smiling
pool
to
wait
until
quack
should
come
back
there
for
the
night
of
course
he
told
peter
rabbit
all
about
quack
and
peter
was
so
delighted
at
the
thought
that
quack
was
alive
that
he
capered
about
in
quite
the
craziest
way
does
quack
know
yet
asked
peter
sammy
shook
his
head
i
going
to
tell
her
when
she
comes
back
here
he
explained
i
was
afraid
if
i
told
her
before
then
she
would
fly
straight
to
him
and
perhaps
get
them
both
in
quite
right
sammy
quite
right
peter
exclaimed
i
have
thought
of
that
my
wo
she
be
happy
when
you
do
tell
her
i
wonder
what
she
say
and
what
she
do
i
going
to
stay
right
here
so
as
to
see
her
when
she
hears
the
good
news
here
comes
your
cousin
blacky
the
crow
does
he
know
yet
no
replied
sammy
but
i
going
to
tell
him
as
soon
as
he
gets
they
watched
blacky
draw
nearer
and
nearer
and
as
soon
as
he
was
within
hearing
sammy
shouted
the
news
caw
caw
caw
replied
blacky
hurrying
a
little
faster
as
soon
as
he
reached
the
big
sammy
told
the
whole
story
over
again
and
blacky
was
quite
as
glad
as
the
others
while
they
waited
for
quack
he
told
how
he
had
hunted
and
hunted
along
the
farther
bank
of
the
big
river
and
how
he
had
seen
the
hunters
with
their
terrible
guns
hiding
and
had
warned
quack
just
where
each
one
was
jolly
round
red
sun
was
getting
ready
to
go
to
bed
behind
the
purple
hills
and
the
black
shadows
were
beginning
to
creep
out
over
the
green
meadows
before
quack
came
in
fact
sammy
jay
and
blacky
were
getting
very
uneasy
it
was
almost
for
them
for
neither
of
them
dared
stay
out
after
dark
they
had
almost
made
up
their
minds
to
leave
peter
to
tell
the
news
when
they
saw
quack
coming
swiftly
from
the
direction
of
the
big
river
she
looked
so
sad
and
discouraged
that
even
blacky
the
crow
was
sorry
for
her
and
you
know
blacky
is
much
given
to
such
feelings
what
the
news
quack
asked
peter
his
eyes
dancing
there
is
any
replied
quack
oh
yes
there
is
cried
sammy
jay
who
could
possibly
keep
still
any
longer
what
is
it
demanded
quack
eagerly
and
it
seemed
to
peter
that
there
was
a
wee
bit
of
hope
in
her
voice
did
you
happen
to
notice
that
just
before
the
laughing
brook
joins
the
big
river
it
flows
through
a
little
swamp
asked
sammy
quack
nodded
her
head
rapidly
what
of
it
she
demanded
nothing
much
only
if
i
were
you
i
would
go
down
there
after
dark
replied
sammy
quack
looked
up
at
sammy
sharply
why
should
i
go
down
there
she
asked
if
i
tell
you
will
you
wait
until
i
get
quite
through
asked
sammy
in
his
turn
quack
promised
that
she
would
well
then
replied
sammy
this
afternoon
i
found
a
stranger
hiding
in
there
a
stranger
with
a
beautiful
green
head
and
neck
and
a
white
mr
quack
oh
it
was
quack
cried
quack
joyfully
and
lifted
her
wings
as
if
she
would
start
for
the
swamp
at
once
stop
cried
sammy
sharply
you
said
you
would
wait
until
i
am
through
it
wo
do
for
you
to
go
there
until
after
dark
because
there
is
a
hunter
hiding
very
near
quack
wait
until
it
is
dark
and
he
has
gone
home
then
take
my
advice
and
when
you
have
found
quack
bring
him
right
up
here
to
the
smiling
pool
he
ca
fly
but
he
can
swim
up
the
laughing
brook
and
this
is
the
safest
place
for
both
of
you
now
good
night
and
good
xix
jerry
muskrat
great
idea
a
friendly
friend
is
a
friend
indeed
when
he
proves
a
friend
in
the
time
of
need
and
quack
had
been
so
much
taken
up
with
each
other
and
with
their
troubles
that
they
had
quite
forgotten
they
were
not
alone
in
the
smiling
pool
which
they
had
reached
by
swimming
up
the
laughing
brook
so
it
happened
that
when
quack
suggested
that
if
quack
wing
got
strong
they
might
be
able
to
find
a
lonesome
pond
not
too
far
away
where
they
could
make
their
home
for
the
summer
they
were
a
little
startled
to
hear
a
voice
say
i
know
where
there
is
one
and
you
will
not
have
to
fly
at
all
to
get
to
both
jumped
a
little
you
see
their
nerves
had
been
very
much
upset
for
a
long
time
and
the
least
unexpected
thing
made
them
jump
then
both
laughed
hello
jerry
muskrat
we
forgotten
all
about
you
said
quack
what
was
that
you
said
jerry
repeated
what
he
had
said
quack
face
brightened
do
you
really
mean
it
she
asked
eagerly
do
you
really
mean
that
you
know
of
a
pond
where
we
could
live
and
not
be
likely
to
be
seen
by
these
creatures
called
men
that
what
i
said
replied
jerry
briefly
oh
jerry
you
not
joking
are
you
tell
me
you
not
joking
begged
quack
of
course
i
not
joking
returned
jerry
just
a
little
bit
indignantly
i
am
not
the
kind
of
a
fellow
to
joke
people
who
are
in
such
trouble
as
you
and
quack
seem
to
be
in
the
idea
came
to
me
while
you
were
talking
i
could
help
overhearing
what
you
were
saying
and
the
minute
you
mentioned
a
lonesome
pond
the
idea
came
to
me
and
i
think
it
a
perfectly
splendid
idea
i
know
of
just
the
lonesomest
kind
of
a
lonesome
pond
and
you
wo
have
to
fly
a
stroke
to
get
to
it
if
you
are
smart
enough
not
to
be
caught
by
reddy
fox
or
hooty
the
owl
or
billy
mink
or
any
of
those
people
who
hunt
for
a
living
there
is
any
reason
i
know
of
why
you
should
spend
the
summer
there
in
peace
and
quack
eyes
fairly
shone
with
hope
and
eagerness
oh
jerry
tell
us
where
it
is
and
we
start
for
it
right
away
she
cried
jerry
eyes
twinkled
of
course
the
owner
of
that
pond
might
not
like
to
have
neighbors
i
had
thought
of
that
said
he
perhaps
he
ought
to
be
asked
quack
face
fell
who
is
the
owner
she
asked
my
cousin
paddy
the
beaver
he
made
it
replied
jerry
proudly
quack
face
lighted
up
again
at
once
i
sure
he
object
said
she
we
know
a
great
many
of
the
beaver
family
in
fact
they
are
very
good
neighbors
of
ours
in
our
home
in
the
far
northland
i
did
suppose
there
was
a
beaver
pond
anywhere
around
here
tell
me
where
it
is
jerry
and
i
go
right
up
there
and
call
on
your
all
you
got
to
do
is
to
follow
the
laughing
brook
way
back
into
the
green
forest
and
you
come
to
paddy
pond
said
he
he
made
that
pond
himself
two
years
ago
he
came
down
from
the
great
woods
and
built
a
dam
across
the
laughing
brook
way
back
there
in
the
green
forest
and
gave
us
a
great
scare
here
in
the
smiling
pool
by
cutting
off
the
water
for
a
few
days
he
has
got
a
very
nice
pond
there
now
honker
the
goose
and
his
flock
spent
a
night
in
it
on
their
way
south
last
quack
waited
to
hear
no
more
she
shot
up
into
the
air
and
disappeared
over
the
tops
of
the
trees
in
the
green
forest
what
do
you
think
of
my
idea
asked
jerry
as
he
and
quack
watched
her
out
of
sight
i
think
it
is
great
just
simply
great
replied
quack
xx
happy
days
for
and
quack
whose
heart
is
true
and
brave
and
strong
who
gives
up
to
grim
despair
will
find
some
day
that
skies
are
blue
and
all
the
world
is
bright
and
fair
if
you
do
believe
it
just
ask
and
quack
they
know
certainly
the
world
never
looked
darker
for
any
one
than
it
did
for
them
when
the
terrible
gun
of
a
hunter
broke
quack
wing
on
the
big
river
and
ended
all
their
dreams
of
a
home
in
the
far
northland
then
through
the
help
of
jerry
muskrat
they
found
the
lonely
pond
of
paddy
the
beaver
deep
in
the
green
forest
and
there
because
their
secret
had
been
well
kept
presently
they
found
peace
and
hope
and
then
happiness
you
see
the
heart
of
quack
was
true
and
brave
and
strong
she
was
the
kind
to
make
the
best
of
things
and
she
at
once
decided
that
if
they
could
have
their
home
where
they
wanted
it
they
would
have
it
where
they
could
have
it
she
was
determined
that
they
should
have
a
home
anyway
and
paddy
the
beaver
little
pond
was
not
such
a
bad
place
after
all
so
she
wasted
no
time
she
examined
every
inch
of
the
shore
of
that
little
pond
at
last
a
little
back
from
the
water
she
found
a
place
to
suit
her
a
place
so
well
hidden
by
bushes
that
only
the
sharpest
eyes
ever
would
find
it
and
a
little
later
it
would
be
still
harder
to
find
as
she
well
knew
for
all
about
clumps
of
tall
ferns
were
springing
up
and
when
they
had
fully
unfolded
not
even
the
keen
eyes
of
sammy
jay
looking
down
from
a
tree
would
be
able
to
discover
her
secret
there
she
made
a
nest
on
the
ground
a
nest
of
dried
grass
and
leaves
and
lined
it
with
the
softest
and
most
beautiful
of
linings
down
plucked
from
her
own
breast
in
it
she
laid
ten
eggs
then
came
long
weeks
of
patient
sitting
on
them
watching
the
wonder
of
growing
things
about
her
the
bursting
into
bloom
of
shy
wood
flowers
the
unfolding
of
leaves
on
bush
and
tree
the
springing
up
in
a
night
of
queer
mushrooms
which
people
call
toadstools
and
all
the
time
dreaming
beautiful
duck
dreams
of
the
babies
which
would
one
day
hatch
from
those
precious
eggs
she
never
left
them
save
to
get
a
little
food
and
just
enough
exercise
to
keep
her
well
and
strong
and
when
she
did
leave
them
she
always
carefully
pulled
soft
down
over
them
to
keep
them
warm
while
she
was
away
quack
knew
all
about
that
nest
though
he
had
taken
no
part
in
building
it
and
had
no
share
in
the
care
of
those
eggs
he
was
very
willing
that
she
should
do
all
the
work
and
thought
it
quite
sufficient
that
he
should
be
on
guard
to
give
warning
if
danger
should
appear
so
he
spent
the
long
beautiful
days
lazily
swimming
about
in
the
little
pond
gossiping
with
paddy
the
beaver
and
taking
the
best
of
care
of
himself
the
broken
wing
healed
and
grew
strong
again
for
it
had
not
been
so
badly
broken
after
all
if
he
missed
the
company
of
others
of
his
kind
which
he
would
have
had
during
these
long
days
of
waiting
had
they
been
able
to
reach
their
usual
in
the
far
northland
he
never
mentioned
it
unknown
to
them
farmer
brown
boy
discovered
where
they
were
later
he
came
often
to
the
pond
and
was
content
to
sit
quietly
on
the
shore
and
watch
quack
so
that
quack
grew
quite
used
to
him
and
did
not
fear
him
at
all
in
fact
after
the
first
few
times
he
made
no
attempt
to
hide
you
see
he
discovered
that
farmer
brown
boy
was
a
friend
always
after
he
had
left
there
was
something
good
to
eat
near
where
he
had
been
sitting
for
farmer
brown
boy
brought
corn
and
oats
and
sometimes
a
handful
of
wheat
he
knew
and
quack
knew
that
he
knew
that
somewhere
near
was
a
nest
but
he
did
not
try
to
find
it
much
as
he
longed
to
for
he
knew
that
would
frighten
and
worry
quack
so
the
dear
precious
secret
of
and
quack
was
kept
for
not
even
paddy
the
beaver
knew
just
where
that
nest
was
and
in
due
time
early
one
morning
quack
proudly
led
forth
for
their
first
swim
ten
downy
funny
ducklings
illustration
with
caption
those
were
happy
days
indeed
for
and
quack
in
the
pond
of
paddy
the
beaver
oh
those
were
happy
days
indeed
for
and
quack
in
the
pond
of
paddy
the
beaver
and
in
their
joy
they
quite
forgot
for
a
time
the
terrible
journey
which
had
brought
them
there
but
finally
the
ducklings
grew
up
and
when
jack
frost
came
in
the
fall
the
whole
family
started
on
the
long
journey
to
the
sunny
southland
i
hope
they
got
there
safely
do
you
among
those
whom
and
quack
came
to
know
very
well
while
they
lived
in
the
pond
of
paddy
the
beaver
was
that
funny
fellow
who
wears
rings
on
his
tail

coon
