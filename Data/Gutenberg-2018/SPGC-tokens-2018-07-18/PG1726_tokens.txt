theaetetus
by
plato
translated
by
benjamin
jowett
introduction
and
analysis
some
dialogues
of
plato
are
of
so
various
a
character
that
their
relation
to
the
other
dialogues
can
not
be
determined
with
any
degree
of
certainty
the
theaetetus
like
the
parmenides
has
points
of
similarity
both
with
his
earlier
and
his
later
writings
the
perfection
of
style
the
humour
the
dramatic
interest
the
complexity
of
structure
the
fertility
of
illustration
the
shifting
of
the
points
of
view
are
characteristic
of
his
best
period
of
authorship
the
vain
search
the
negative
conclusion
the
figure
of
the
midwives
the
constant
profession
of
ignorance
on
the
part
of
socrates
also
bear
the
stamp
of
the
early
dialogues
in
which
the
original
socrates
is
not
yet
platonized
had
we
no
other
indications
we
should
be
disposed
to
range
the
theaetetus
with
the
apology
and
the
phaedrus
and
perhaps
even
with
the
protagoras
and
the
laches
but
when
we
pass
from
the
style
to
an
examination
of
the
subject
we
trace
a
connection
with
the
later
rather
than
with
the
earlier
dialogues
in
the
first
place
there
is
the
connexion
indicated
by
plato
himself
at
the
end
of
the
dialogue
with
the
sophist
to
which
in
many
respects
the
theaetetus
is
so
little
akin
the
same
persons
reappear
including
the
younger
socrates
whose
name
is
just
mentioned
in
the
theaetetus
the
theory
of
rest
which
socrates
has
declined
to
consider
is
resumed
by
the
eleatic
stranger
there
is
a
similar
allusion
in
both
dialogues
to
the
meeting
of
parmenides
and
socrates
soph
and
the
inquiry
into
in
the
sophist
supplements
the
question
of
false
opinion
which
is
raised
in
the
theaetetus
compare
also
theaet
and
soph
for
parallel
turns
of
thought
secondly
the
later
date
of
the
dialogue
is
confirmed
by
the
absence
of
the
doctrine
of
recollection
and
of
any
doctrine
of
ideas
except
that
which
derives
them
from
generalization
and
from
reflection
of
the
mind
upon
itself
the
general
character
of
the
theaetetus
is
dialectical
and
there
are
traces
of
the
same
megarian
influences
which
appear
in
the
parmenides
and
which
later
writers
in
their
matter
of
fact
way
have
explained
by
the
residence
of
plato
at
megara
socrates
disclaims
the
character
of
a
professional
eristic
and
also
with
a
sort
of
ironical
admiration
expresses
his
inability
to
attain
the
megarian
precision
in
the
use
of
terms
yet
he
too
employs
a
similar
sophistical
skill
in
overturning
every
conceivable
theory
of
knowledge
the
direct
indications
of
a
date
amount
to
no
more
than
this
the
conversation
is
said
to
have
taken
place
when
theaetetus
was
a
youth
and
shortly
before
the
death
of
socrates
at
the
time
of
his
own
death
he
is
supposed
to
be
a
man
allowing
nine
or
ten
years
for
the
interval
between
youth
and
manhood
the
dialogue
could
not
have
been
written
earlier
than
when
plato
was
about
years
of
age
no
more
definite
date
is
indicated
by
the
engagement
in
which
theaetetus
is
said
to
have
fallen
or
to
have
been
wounded
and
which
may
have
taken
place
any
time
during
the
corinthian
war
between
the
years
the
later
date
which
has
been
suggested
when
the
athenians
and
lacedaemonians
disputed
the
isthmus
with
epaminondas
would
make
the
age
of
theaetetus
at
his
death
or
this
a
little
impairs
the
beauty
of
socrates
remark
that
would
be
a
great
man
if
he
lived
in
this
uncertainty
about
the
place
of
the
theaetetus
it
seemed
better
as
in
the
case
of
the
republic
timaeus
critias
to
retain
the
order
in
which
plato
himself
has
arranged
this
and
the
two
companion
dialogues
we
can
not
exclude
the
possibility
which
has
been
already
noticed
in
reference
to
other
works
of
plato
that
the
theaetetus
may
not
have
been
all
written
continuously
or
the
probability
that
the
sophist
and
politicus
which
differ
greatly
in
style
were
only
appended
after
a
long
interval
of
time
the
allusion
to
parmenides
compared
with
the
sophist
would
probably
imply
that
the
dialogue
which
is
called
by
his
name
was
already
in
existence
unless
indeed
we
suppose
the
passage
in
which
the
allusion
occurs
to
have
been
inserted
afterwards
again
the
theaetetus
may
be
connected
with
the
gorgias
either
dialogue
from
different
points
of
view
containing
an
analysis
of
the
real
and
apparent
schleiermacher
and
both
may
be
brought
into
relation
with
the
apology
as
illustrating
the
personal
life
of
socrates
the
philebus
too
may
with
equal
reason
be
placed
either
after
or
before
what
in
the
language
of
thrasyllus
may
be
called
the
second
platonic
trilogy
both
the
parmenides
and
the
sophist
and
still
more
the
theaetetus
have
points
of
affinity
with
the
cratylus
in
which
the
principles
of
rest
and
motion
are
again
contrasted
and
the
sophistical
or
protagorean
theory
of
language
is
opposed
to
that
which
is
attributed
to
the
disciple
of
heracleitus
not
to
speak
of
lesser
resemblances
in
thought
and
language
the
parmenides
again
has
been
thought
by
some
to
hold
an
intermediate
position
between
the
theaetetus
and
the
sophist
upon
this
view
the
sophist
may
be
regarded
as
the
answer
to
the
problems
about
one
and
being
which
have
been
raised
in
the
parmenides
any
of
these
arrangements
may
suggest
new
views
to
the
student
of
plato
none
of
them
can
lay
claim
to
an
exclusive
probability
in
its
favour
the
theaetetus
is
one
of
the
narrated
dialogues
of
plato
and
is
the
only
one
which
is
supposed
to
have
been
written
down
in
a
short
introductory
scene
euclides
and
terpsion
are
described
as
meeting
before
the
door
of
euclides
house
in
megara
this
may
have
been
a
spot
familiar
to
plato
for
megara
was
within
a
walk
of
athens
but
no
importance
can
be
attached
to
the
accidental
introduction
of
the
founder
of
the
megarian
philosophy
the
real
intention
of
the
preface
is
to
create
an
interest
about
the
person
of
theaetetus
who
has
just
been
carried
up
from
the
army
at
corinth
in
a
dying
state
the
expectation
of
his
death
recalls
the
promise
of
his
youth
and
especially
the
famous
conversation
which
socrates
had
with
him
when
he
was
quite
young
a
few
days
before
his
own
trial
and
death
as
we
are
once
more
reminded
at
the
end
of
the
dialogue
yet
we
may
observe
that
plato
has
himself
forgotten
this
when
he
represents
euclides
as
from
time
to
time
coming
to
athens
and
correcting
the
copy
from
socrates
own
mouth
the
narrative
having
introduced
theaetetus
and
having
guaranteed
the
authenticity
of
the
dialogue
compare
symposium
phaedo
parmenides
is
then
dropped
no
further
use
is
made
of
the
device
as
plato
himself
remarks
who
in
this
as
in
some
other
minute
points
is
imitated
by
cicero
de
amicitia
the
interlocutory
words
are
omitted
theaetetus
the
hero
of
the
battle
of
corinth
and
of
the
dialogue
is
a
disciple
of
theodorus
the
great
geometrician
whose
science
is
thus
indicated
to
be
the
propaedeutic
to
philosophy
an
interest
has
been
already
excited
about
him
by
his
approaching
death
and
now
he
is
introduced
to
us
anew
by
the
praises
of
his
master
theodorus
he
is
a
youthful
socrates
and
exhibits
the
same
contrast
of
the
fair
soul
and
the
ungainly
face
and
frame
the
silenus
mask
and
the
god
within
which
are
described
in
the
symposium
the
picture
which
theodorus
gives
of
his
courage
and
patience
and
intelligence
and
modesty
is
verified
in
the
course
of
the
dialogue
his
courage
is
shown
by
his
behaviour
in
the
battle
and
his
other
qualities
shine
forth
as
the
argument
proceeds
socrates
takes
an
evident
delight
in
wise
theaetetus
who
has
more
in
him
than
bearded
men
he
is
quite
inspired
by
his
answers
at
first
the
youth
is
lost
in
wonder
and
is
almost
too
modest
to
speak
but
encouraged
by
socrates
he
rises
to
the
occasion
and
grows
full
of
interest
and
enthusiasm
about
the
great
question
like
a
youth
he
has
not
finally
made
up
his
mind
and
is
very
ready
to
follow
the
lead
of
socrates
and
to
enter
into
each
successive
phase
of
the
discussion
which
turns
up
his
great
dialectical
talent
is
shown
in
his
power
of
drawing
distinctions
and
of
foreseeing
the
consequences
of
his
own
answers
the
enquiry
about
the
nature
of
knowledge
is
not
new
to
him
long
ago
he
has
felt
the
of
philosophy
and
has
experienced
the
youthful
intoxication
which
is
depicted
in
the
philebus
but
he
has
hitherto
been
unable
to
make
the
transition
from
mathematics
to
metaphysics
he
can
form
a
general
conception
of
square
and
oblong
numbers
but
he
is
unable
to
attain
a
similar
expression
of
knowledge
in
the
abstract
yet
at
length
he
begins
to
recognize
that
there
are
universal
conceptions
of
being
likeness
sameness
number
which
the
mind
contemplates
in
herself
and
with
the
help
of
socrates
is
conducted
from
a
theory
of
sense
to
a
theory
of
ideas
there
is
no
reason
to
doubt
that
theaetetus
was
a
real
person
whose
name
survived
in
the
next
generation
but
neither
can
any
importance
be
attached
to
the
notices
of
him
in
suidas
and
proclus
which
are
probably
based
on
the
mention
of
him
in
plato
according
to
a
confused
statement
in
suidas
who
mentions
him
twice
over
first
as
a
pupil
of
socrates
and
then
of
plato
he
is
said
to
have
written
the
first
work
on
the
five
solids
but
no
early
authority
cites
the
work
the
invention
of
which
may
have
been
easily
suggested
by
the
division
of
roots
which
plato
attributes
to
him
and
the
allusion
to
the
backward
state
of
solid
geometry
in
the
republic
at
any
rate
there
is
no
occasion
to
recall
him
to
life
again
after
the
battle
of
corinth
in
order
that
we
may
allow
time
for
the
completion
of
such
a
work
muller
we
may
also
remark
that
such
a
supposition
entirely
destroys
the
pathetic
interest
of
the
introduction
theodorus
the
geometrician
had
once
been
the
friend
and
disciple
of
protagoras
but
he
is
very
reluctant
to
leave
his
retirement
and
defend
his
old
master
he
is
too
old
to
learn
socrates
game
of
question
and
answer
and
prefers
the
digressions
to
the
main
argument
because
he
finds
them
easier
to
follow
the
mathematician
as
socrates
says
in
the
republic
is
not
capable
of
giving
a
reason
in
the
same
manner
as
the
dialectician
and
theodorus
could
not
therefore
have
been
appropriately
introduced
as
the
chief
respondent
but
he
may
be
fairly
appealed
to
when
the
honour
of
his
master
is
at
stake
he
is
the
of
his
orphans
although
this
is
a
responsibility
which
he
wishes
to
throw
upon
callias
the
friend
and
patron
of
all
sophists
declaring
that
he
himself
had
early
away
from
philosophy
and
was
absorbed
in
mathematics
his
extreme
dislike
to
the
heraclitean
fanatics
which
may
be
compared
with
the
dislike
of
theaetetus
to
the
materialists
and
his
ready
acceptance
of
the
noble
words
of
socrates
are
noticeable
traits
of
character
the
socrates
of
the
theaetetus
is
the
same
as
the
socrates
of
the
earlier
dialogues
he
is
the
invincible
disputant
now
advanced
in
years
of
the
protagoras
and
symposium
he
is
still
pursuing
his
divine
mission
his
labours
of
which
he
has
described
the
origin
in
the
apology
and
he
still
hears
the
voice
of
his
oracle
bidding
him
receive
or
not
receive
the
truant
souls
there
he
is
supposed
to
have
a
mission
to
convict
men
of
in
the
theaetetus
he
has
assigned
to
him
by
god
the
functions
of
a
who
delivers
men
of
their
thoughts
and
under
this
character
he
is
present
throughout
the
dialogue
he
is
the
true
prophet
who
has
an
insight
into
the
natures
of
men
and
can
divine
their
future
and
he
knows
that
sympathy
is
the
secret
power
which
unlocks
their
thoughts
the
hit
at
aristides
the
son
of
lysimachus
who
was
specially
committed
to
his
charge
in
the
laches
may
be
remarked
by
the
way
the
attempt
to
discover
the
definition
of
knowledge
is
in
accordance
with
the
character
of
socrates
as
he
is
described
in
the
memorabilia
asking
what
is
justice
what
is
temperance
and
the
like
but
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
he
would
have
analyzed
the
nature
of
perception
or
traced
the
connexion
of
protagoras
and
heracleitus
or
have
raised
the
difficulty
respecting
false
opinion
the
humorous
illustrations
as
well
as
the
serious
thoughts
run
through
the
dialogue
the
snubnosedness
of
theaetetus
a
characteristic
which
he
shares
with
socrates
and
the
of
socrates
are
not
forgotten
in
the
closing
words
at
the
end
of
the
dialogue
as
in
the
euthyphro
he
is
expecting
to
meet
meletus
at
the
porch
of
the
king
archon
but
with
the
same
indifference
to
the
result
which
is
everywhere
displayed
by
him
he
proposes
that
they
shall
reassemble
on
the
following
day
at
the
same
spot
the
day
comes
and
in
the
sophist
the
three
friends
again
meet
but
no
further
allusion
is
made
to
the
trial
and
the
principal
share
in
the
argument
is
assigned
not
to
socrates
but
to
an
eleatic
stranger
the
youthful
theaetetus
also
plays
a
different
and
less
independent
part
and
there
is
no
allusion
in
the
introduction
to
the
second
and
third
dialogues
which
are
afterwards
appended
there
seems
therefore
reason
to
think
that
there
is
a
real
change
both
in
the
characters
and
in
the
design
the
dialogue
is
an
enquiry
into
the
nature
of
knowledge
which
is
interrupted
by
two
digressions
the
first
is
the
digression
about
the
midwives
which
is
also
a
leading
thought
or
continuous
image
like
the
wave
in
the
republic
appearing
and
reappearing
at
intervals
again
and
again
we
are
reminded
that
the
successive
conceptions
of
knowledge
are
extracted
from
theaetetus
who
in
his
turn
truly
declares
that
socrates
has
got
a
great
deal
more
out
of
him
than
ever
was
in
him
socrates
is
never
weary
of
working
out
the
image
in
humorous
details
discerning
the
symptoms
of
labour
carrying
the
child
round
the
hearth
fearing
that
theaetetus
will
bite
him
comparing
his
conceptions
to
asserting
an
hereditary
right
to
the
occupation
there
is
also
a
serious
side
to
the
image
which
is
an
apt
similitude
of
the
socratic
theory
of
education
compare
republic
sophist
and
accords
with
the
ironical
spirit
in
which
the
wisest
of
men
delights
to
speak
of
himself
the
other
digression
is
the
famous
contrast
of
the
lawyer
and
philosopher
this
is
a
sort
of
or
break
in
the
middle
of
the
dialogue
at
the
commencement
of
a
great
discussion
the
reflection
naturally
arises
how
happy
are
they
who
like
the
philosopher
have
time
for
such
discussions
compare
republic
there
is
no
reason
for
the
introduction
of
such
a
digression
nor
is
a
reason
always
needed
any
more
than
for
the
introduction
of
an
episode
in
a
poem
or
of
a
topic
in
conversation
that
which
is
given
by
socrates
is
quite
sufficient
viz
that
the
philosopher
may
talk
and
write
as
he
pleases
but
though
not
very
closely
connected
neither
is
the
digression
out
of
keeping
with
the
rest
of
the
dialogue
the
philosopher
naturally
desires
to
pour
forth
the
thoughts
which
are
always
present
to
him
and
to
discourse
of
the
higher
life
the
idea
of
knowledge
although
hard
to
be
defined
is
realised
in
the
life
of
philosophy
and
the
contrast
is
the
favourite
antithesis
between
the
world
in
the
various
characters
of
sophist
lawyer
statesman
speaker
and
the
philosopher
between
opinion
and
knowledge
between
the
conventional
and
the
true
the
greater
part
of
the
dialogue
is
devoted
to
setting
up
and
throwing
down
definitions
of
science
and
knowledge
proceeding
from
the
lower
to
the
higher
by
three
stages
in
which
perception
opinion
reasoning
are
successively
examined
we
first
get
rid
of
the
confusion
of
the
idea
of
knowledge
and
specific
kinds
of
knowledge
a
confusion
which
has
been
already
noticed
in
the
lysis
laches
meno
and
other
dialogues
in
the
infancy
of
logic
a
form
of
thought
has
to
be
invented
before
the
content
can
be
filled
up
we
can
not
define
knowledge
until
the
nature
of
definition
has
been
ascertained
having
succeeded
in
making
his
meaning
plain
socrates
proceeds
to
analyze
the
first
definition
which
theaetetus
proposes
is
sensible
perception
this
is
speedily
identified
with
the
protagorean
saying
is
the
measure
of
all
things
and
of
this
again
the
foundation
is
discovered
in
the
perpetual
flux
of
heracleitus
the
relativeness
of
sensation
is
then
developed
at
length
and
for
a
moment
the
definition
appears
to
be
accepted
but
soon
the
protagorean
thesis
is
pronounced
to
be
suicidal
for
the
adversaries
of
protagoras
are
as
good
a
measure
as
he
is
and
they
deny
his
doctrine
he
is
then
supposed
to
reply
that
the
perception
may
be
true
at
any
given
instant
but
the
reply
is
in
the
end
shown
to
be
inconsistent
with
the
heraclitean
foundation
on
which
the
doctrine
has
been
affirmed
to
rest
for
if
the
heraclitean
flux
is
extended
to
every
sort
of
change
in
every
instant
of
time
how
can
any
thought
or
word
be
detained
even
for
an
instant
sensible
perception
like
everything
else
is
tumbling
to
pieces
nor
can
protagoras
himself
maintain
that
one
man
is
as
good
as
another
in
his
knowledge
of
the
future
and
expedient
if
not
just
and
true
belongs
to
the
sphere
of
the
future
and
so
we
must
ask
again
what
is
knowledge
the
comparison
of
sensations
with
one
another
implies
a
principle
which
is
above
sensation
and
which
resides
in
the
mind
itself
we
are
thus
led
to
look
for
knowledge
in
a
higher
sphere
and
accordingly
theaetetus
when
again
interrogated
replies
that
is
true
opinion
but
how
is
false
opinion
possible
the
megarian
or
eristic
spirit
within
us
revives
the
question
which
has
been
already
asked
and
indirectly
answered
in
the
meno
can
a
man
be
ignorant
of
that
which
he
knows
no
answer
is
given
to
this
not
unanswerable
question
the
comparison
of
the
mind
to
a
block
of
wax
or
to
a
decoy
of
birds
is
found
wanting
but
are
we
not
inverting
the
natural
order
in
looking
for
opinion
before
we
have
found
knowledge
and
knowledge
is
not
true
opinion
for
the
athenian
dicasts
have
true
opinion
but
not
knowledge
what
then
is
knowledge
we
answer
opinion
with
definition
or
explanation
but
all
the
different
ways
in
which
this
statement
may
be
understood
are
set
aside
like
the
definitions
of
courage
in
the
laches
or
of
friendship
in
the
lysis
or
of
temperance
in
the
charmides
at
length
we
arrive
at
the
conclusion
in
which
nothing
is
concluded
there
are
two
special
difficulties
which
beset
the
student
of
the
theaetetus
he
is
uncertain
how
far
he
can
trust
plato
account
of
the
theory
of
protagoras
and
he
is
also
uncertain
how
far
and
in
what
parts
of
the
dialogue
plato
is
expressing
his
own
opinion
the
dramatic
character
of
the
work
renders
the
answer
to
both
these
questions
difficult
in
reply
to
the
first
we
have
only
probabilities
to
offer
three
main
points
have
to
be
decided
a
would
protagoras
have
identified
his
own
thesis
is
the
measure
of
all
things
with
the
other
knowledge
is
sensible
perception
b
would
he
have
based
the
relativity
of
knowledge
on
the
heraclitean
flux
c
would
he
have
asserted
the
absoluteness
of
sensation
at
each
instant
of
the
work
of
protagoras
on
we
know
nothing
with
the
exception
of
the
two
famous
fragments
which
are
cited
in
this
dialogue
is
the
measure
of
all
things
and
there
are
gods
or
not
i
can
not
tell
nor
have
we
any
other
trustworthy
evidence
of
the
tenets
of
protagoras
or
of
the
sense
in
which
his
words
are
used
for
later
writers
including
aristotle
in
his
metaphysics
have
mixed
up
the
protagoras
of
plato
as
they
have
the
socrates
of
plato
with
the
real
person
returning
then
to
the
theaetetus
as
the
only
possible
source
from
which
an
answer
to
these
questions
can
be
obtained
we
may
remark
that
plato
had
truth
of
protagoras
before
him
and
frequently
refers
to
the
book
he
seems
to
say
expressly
that
in
this
work
the
doctrine
of
the
heraclitean
flux
was
not
to
be
found
told
the
real
truth
not
in
the
book
which
is
so
entitled
but
to
his
disciples
words
which
imply
that
the
connexion
between
the
doctrines
of
protagoras
and
heracleitus
was
not
generally
recognized
in
greece
but
was
really
discovered
or
invented
by
plato
on
the
other
hand
the
doctrine
that
is
the
measure
of
all
things
is
expressly
identified
by
socrates
with
the
other
statement
that
appears
to
each
man
is
to
him
and
a
reference
is
made
to
the
books
in
which
the
statement
occurs
this
theaetetus
who
has
read
the
books
is
supposed
to
acknowledge
so
cratylus
and
protagoras
in
the
speech
attributed
to
him
never
says
that
he
has
been
misunderstood
he
rather
seems
to
imply
that
the
absoluteness
of
sensation
at
each
instant
was
to
be
found
in
his
words
he
is
only
indignant
at
the
ad
absurdum
devised
by
socrates
for
his
mensura
which
theodorus
also
considers
to
be
too
bad
the
question
may
be
raised
how
far
plato
in
the
theaetetus
could
have
misrepresented
protagoras
without
violating
the
laws
of
dramatic
probability
could
he
have
pretended
to
cite
from
a
writing
what
was
not
to
be
found
there
but
such
a
shadowy
enquiry
is
not
worth
pursuing
further
we
need
only
remember
that
in
the
criticism
which
follows
of
the
thesis
of
protagoras
we
are
criticizing
the
protagoras
of
plato
and
not
attempting
to
draw
a
precise
line
between
his
real
sentiments
and
those
which
plato
has
attributed
to
him
the
other
difficulty
is
a
more
subtle
and
also
a
more
important
one
because
bearing
on
the
general
character
of
the
platonic
dialogues
on
a
first
reading
of
them
we
are
apt
to
imagine
that
the
truth
is
only
spoken
by
socrates
who
is
never
guilty
of
a
fallacy
himself
and
is
the
great
detector
of
the
errors
and
fallacies
of
others
but
this
natural
presumption
is
disturbed
by
the
discovery
that
the
sophists
are
sometimes
in
the
right
and
socrates
in
the
wrong
like
the
hero
of
a
novel
he
is
not
to
be
supposed
always
to
represent
the
sentiments
of
the
author
there
are
few
modern
readers
who
do
not
side
with
protagoras
rather
than
with
socrates
in
the
dialogue
which
is
called
by
his
name
the
cratylus
presents
a
similar
difficulty
in
his
etymologies
as
in
the
number
of
the
state
we
can
not
tell
how
far
socrates
is
serious
for
the
socratic
irony
will
not
allow
him
to
distinguish
between
his
real
and
his
assumed
wisdom
no
one
is
the
superior
of
the
invincible
socrates
in
argument
except
in
the
first
part
of
the
parmenides
where
he
is
introduced
as
a
youth
but
he
is
by
no
means
supposed
to
be
in
possession
of
the
whole
truth
arguments
are
often
put
into
his
mouth
compare
introduction
to
the
gorgias
which
must
have
seemed
quite
as
untenable
to
plato
as
to
a
modern
writer
in
this
dialogue
a
great
part
of
the
answer
of
protagoras
is
just
and
sound
remarks
are
made
by
him
on
verbal
criticism
and
on
the
importance
of
understanding
an
opponent
meaning
which
are
conceived
in
the
true
spirit
of
philosophy
and
the
distinction
which
he
is
supposed
to
draw
between
eristic
and
dialectic
is
really
a
criticism
of
plato
on
himself
and
his
own
criticism
of
protagoras
the
difficulty
seems
to
arise
from
not
attending
to
the
dramatic
character
of
the
writings
of
plato
there
are
two
or
more
sides
to
questions
and
these
are
parted
among
the
different
speakers
sometimes
one
view
or
aspect
of
a
question
is
made
to
predominate
over
the
rest
as
in
the
gorgias
or
sophist
but
in
other
dialogues
truth
is
divided
as
in
the
laches
and
protagoras
and
the
interest
of
the
piece
consists
in
the
contrast
of
opinions
the
confusion
caused
by
the
irony
of
socrates
who
if
he
is
true
to
his
character
can
not
say
anything
of
his
own
knowledge
is
increased
by
the
circumstance
that
in
the
theaetetus
and
some
other
dialogues
he
is
occasionally
playing
both
parts
himself
and
even
charging
his
own
arguments
with
unfairness
in
the
theaetetus
he
is
designedly
held
back
from
arriving
at
a
conclusion
for
we
can
not
suppose
that
plato
conceived
a
definition
of
knowledge
to
be
impossible
but
this
is
his
manner
of
approaching
and
surrounding
a
question
the
lights
which
he
throws
on
his
subject
are
indirect
but
they
are
not
the
less
real
for
that
he
has
no
intention
of
proving
a
thesis
by
a
argument
nor
does
he
imagine
that
a
great
philosophical
problem
can
be
tied
up
within
the
limits
of
a
definition
if
he
has
analyzed
a
proposition
or
notion
even
with
the
severity
of
an
impossible
logic
if
have
been
compared
by
him
with
other
if
he
has
cleared
up
or
advanced
popular
ideas
or
illustrated
a
new
method
his
aim
has
been
sufficiently
accomplished
the
writings
of
plato
belong
to
an
age
in
which
the
power
of
analysis
had
outrun
the
means
of
knowledge
and
through
a
spurious
use
of
dialectic
the
distinctions
which
had
been
already
from
the
void
and
formless
infinite
seemed
to
be
rapidly
returning
to
their
original
chaos
the
two
great
speculative
philosophies
which
a
century
earlier
had
so
deeply
impressed
the
mind
of
hellas
were
now
degenerating
into
eristic
the
contemporaries
of
plato
and
socrates
were
vainly
trying
to
find
new
combinations
of
them
or
to
transfer
them
from
the
object
to
the
subject
the
megarians
in
their
first
attempts
to
attain
a
severer
logic
were
making
knowledge
impossible
compare
they
were
asserting
one
good
under
many
names
and
like
the
cynics
seem
to
have
denied
predication
while
the
cynics
themselves
were
depriving
virtue
of
all
which
made
virtue
desirable
in
the
eyes
of
socrates
and
plato
and
besides
these
we
find
mention
in
the
later
writings
of
plato
especially
in
the
theaetetus
sophist
and
laws
of
certain
impenetrable
godless
persons
who
will
not
believe
what
they
can
not
hold
in
their
hands
and
can
not
be
approached
in
argument
because
they
can
not
argue
theat
no
school
of
greek
philosophers
exactly
answers
to
these
persons
in
whom
plato
may
perhaps
have
blended
some
features
of
the
atomists
with
the
vulgar
materialistic
tendencies
of
mankind
in
general
compare
introduction
to
the
sophist
and
not
only
was
there
a
conflict
of
opinions
but
the
stage
which
the
mind
had
reached
presented
other
difficulties
hardly
intelligible
to
us
who
live
in
a
different
cycle
of
human
thought
all
times
of
mental
progress
are
times
of
confusion
we
only
see
or
rather
seem
to
see
things
clearly
when
they
have
been
long
fixed
and
defined
in
the
age
of
plato
the
limits
of
the
world
of
imagination
and
of
pure
abstraction
of
the
old
world
and
the
new
were
not
yet
fixed
the
greeks
in
the
fourth
century
before
christ
had
no
words
for
and
and
no
distinct
conception
of
them
yet
they
were
always
hovering
about
the
question
involved
in
them
the
analysis
of
sense
and
the
analysis
of
thought
were
equally
difficult
to
them
and
hopelessly
confused
by
the
attempt
to
solve
them
not
through
an
appeal
to
facts
but
by
the
help
of
general
theories
respecting
the
nature
of
the
universe
plato
in
his
theaetetus
gathers
up
the
sceptical
tendencies
of
his
age
and
compares
them
but
he
does
not
seek
to
reconstruct
out
of
them
a
theory
of
knowledge
the
time
at
which
such
a
theory
could
be
framed
had
not
yet
arrived
for
there
was
no
measure
of
experience
with
which
the
ideas
swarming
in
men
minds
could
be
compared
the
meaning
of
the
word
could
scarcely
be
explained
to
them
except
from
the
mathematical
sciences
which
alone
offered
the
type
of
universality
and
certainty
philosophy
was
becoming
more
and
more
vacant
and
abstract
and
not
only
the
platonic
ideas
and
the
eleatic
being
but
all
abstractions
seemed
to
be
at
variance
with
sense
and
at
war
with
one
another
the
want
of
the
greek
mind
in
the
fourth
century
before
christ
was
not
another
theory
of
rest
or
motion
or
being
or
atoms
but
rather
a
philosophy
which
could
free
the
mind
from
the
power
of
abstractions
and
alternatives
and
show
how
far
rest
and
how
far
motion
how
far
the
universal
principle
of
being
and
the
multitudinous
principle
of
atoms
entered
into
the
composition
of
the
world
which
could
distinguish
between
the
true
and
false
analogy
and
allow
the
negative
as
well
as
the
positive
a
place
in
human
thought
to
such
a
philosophy
plato
in
the
theaetetus
offers
many
contributions
he
has
followed
philosophy
into
the
region
of
mythology
and
pointed
out
the
similarities
of
opposing
phases
of
thought
he
has
also
shown
that
extreme
abstractions
are
and
indeed
hardly
distinguishable
from
one
another
but
his
intention
is
not
to
unravel
the
whole
subject
of
knowledge
if
this
had
been
possible
and
several
times
in
the
course
of
the
dialogue
he
rejects
explanations
of
knowledge
which
have
germs
of
truth
in
them
as
for
example
resolution
of
the
compound
into
the
simple
or
opinion
with
a
mark
of
difference
terpsion
who
has
come
to
megara
from
the
country
is
described
as
having
looked
in
vain
for
euclides
in
the
agora
the
latter
explains
that
he
has
been
down
to
the
harbour
and
on
his
way
thither
had
met
theaetetus
who
was
being
carried
up
from
the
army
to
athens
he
was
scarcely
alive
for
he
had
been
badly
wounded
at
the
battle
of
corinth
and
had
taken
the
dysentery
which
prevailed
in
the
camp
the
mention
of
his
condition
suggests
the
reflection
a
loss
he
will
be
indeed
replies
euclid
just
now
i
was
hearing
of
his
noble
conduct
in
the
battle
i
should
expect
but
why
did
he
not
remain
at
megara
wanted
him
to
remain
but
he
would
not
so
i
went
with
him
as
far
as
erineum
and
as
i
parted
from
him
i
remembered
that
socrates
had
seen
him
when
he
was
a
youth
and
had
a
remarkable
conversation
with
him
not
long
before
his
own
death
and
he
then
prophesied
of
him
that
he
would
be
a
great
man
if
he
lived
true
that
has
been
how
like
all
that
socrates
said
and
could
you
repeat
the
conversation
from
memory
but
i
took
notes
when
i
returned
home
which
i
afterwards
filled
up
at
leisure
and
got
socrates
to
correct
them
from
time
to
time
when
i
came
to
athens
terpsion
had
long
intended
to
ask
for
a
sight
of
this
writing
of
which
he
had
already
heard
they
are
both
tired
and
agree
to
rest
and
have
the
conversation
read
to
them
by
a
servant
is
the
roll
terpsion
i
need
only
observe
that
i
have
omitted
for
the
sake
of
convenience
the
interlocutory
words
said
i
said
he
and
that
theaetetus
and
theodorus
the
geometrician
of
cyrene
are
the
persons
with
whom
socrates
is
conversing
socrates
begins
by
asking
theodorus
whether
in
his
visit
to
athens
he
has
found
any
athenian
youth
likely
to
attain
distinction
in
science
socrates
there
is
one
very
remarkable
youth
with
whom
i
have
become
acquainted
he
is
no
beauty
and
therefore
you
need
not
imagine
that
i
am
in
love
with
him
and
to
say
the
truth
he
is
very
like
you
for
he
has
a
snub
nose
and
projecting
eyes
although
these
features
are
not
so
marked
in
him
as
in
you
he
combines
the
most
various
qualities
quickness
patience
courage
and
he
is
gentle
as
well
as
wise
always
silently
flowing
on
like
a
river
of
oil
look
he
is
the
middle
one
of
those
who
are
entering
the
palaestra
socrates
who
does
not
know
his
name
recognizes
him
as
the
son
of
euphronius
who
was
himself
a
good
man
and
a
rich
he
is
informed
by
theodorus
that
the
youth
is
named
theaetetus
but
the
property
of
his
father
has
disappeared
in
the
hands
of
trustees
this
does
not
however
prevent
him
from
adding
liberality
to
his
other
virtues
at
the
desire
of
socrates
he
invites
theaetetus
to
sit
by
them
says
socrates
i
may
see
in
you
theaetetus
the
image
of
my
ugly
self
as
theodorus
declares
not
that
his
remark
is
of
any
importance
for
though
he
is
a
philosopher
he
is
not
a
painter
and
therefore
he
is
no
judge
of
our
faces
but
as
he
is
a
man
of
science
he
may
be
a
judge
of
our
intellects
and
if
he
were
to
praise
the
mental
endowments
of
either
of
us
in
that
case
the
hearer
of
the
eulogy
ought
to
examine
into
what
he
says
and
the
subject
should
not
refuse
to
be
examined
theaetetus
consents
and
is
caught
in
a
trap
compare
the
similar
trap
which
is
laid
for
theodorus
theaetetus
you
will
have
to
be
examined
for
theodorus
has
been
praising
you
in
a
style
of
which
i
never
heard
the
like
was
only
jesting
that
is
not
his
way
and
i
can
not
allow
you
on
that
pretence
to
retract
the
assent
which
you
have
already
given
or
i
shall
make
theodorus
repeat
your
praises
and
swear
to
them
theaetetus
in
reply
professes
that
he
is
willing
to
be
examined
and
socrates
begins
by
asking
him
what
he
learns
of
theodorus
he
is
himself
anxious
to
learn
anything
of
anybody
and
now
he
has
a
little
question
to
which
he
wants
theaetetus
or
theodorus
or
whichever
of
the
company
would
not
be
to
the
rest
to
find
an
answer
without
further
preface
but
at
the
same
time
apologizing
for
his
eagerness
he
asks
is
knowledge
theodorus
is
too
old
to
answer
questions
and
begs
him
to
interrogate
theaetetus
who
has
the
advantage
of
youth
theaetetus
replies
that
knowledge
is
what
he
learns
of
theodorus
geometry
and
arithmetic
and
that
there
are
other
kinds
of
knowledge
shoemaking
carpentering
and
the
like
but
socrates
rejoins
that
this
answer
contains
too
much
and
also
too
little
for
although
theaetetus
has
enumerated
several
kinds
of
knowledge
he
has
not
explained
the
common
nature
of
them
as
if
he
had
been
asked
is
clay
and
instead
of
saying
is
moistened
earth
he
had
answered
is
one
clay
of
another
of
potters
another
of
theaetetus
at
once
divines
that
socrates
means
him
to
extend
to
all
kinds
of
knowledge
the
same
process
of
generalization
which
he
has
already
learned
to
apply
to
arithmetic
for
he
has
discovered
a
division
of
numbers
into
square
numbers
which
are
composed
of
equal
factors
and
represent
figures
which
have
equal
sides
and
oblong
numbers
which
are
composed
of
unequal
factors
and
represent
figures
which
have
unequal
sides
but
he
has
never
succeeded
in
attaining
a
similar
conception
of
knowledge
though
he
has
often
tried
and
when
this
and
similar
questions
were
brought
to
him
from
socrates
has
been
sorely
distressed
by
them
socrates
explains
to
him
that
he
is
in
labour
for
men
as
well
as
women
have
pangs
of
labour
and
both
at
times
require
the
assistance
of
midwives
and
he
socrates
is
a
midwife
although
this
is
a
secret
he
has
inherited
the
art
from
his
mother
bold
and
bluff
and
he
ushers
into
light
not
children
but
the
thoughts
of
men
like
the
midwives
who
are
bearing
children
he
too
can
have
no
offspring
the
god
will
not
allow
him
to
bring
anything
into
the
world
of
his
own
he
also
reminds
theaetetus
that
the
midwives
are
or
ought
to
be
the
only
matchmakers
this
is
the
preparation
for
a
biting
jest
for
those
who
reap
the
fruit
are
most
likely
to
know
on
what
soil
the
plants
will
grow
but
respectable
midwives
avoid
this
department
of
practice
they
do
not
want
to
be
called
procuresses
there
are
some
other
differences
between
the
two
sorts
of
pregnancy
for
women
do
not
bring
into
the
world
at
one
time
real
children
and
at
another
time
idols
which
are
with
difficulty
distinguished
from
them
first
says
socrates
in
his
character
of
the
patients
are
barren
and
stolid
but
after
a
while
they
round
apace
if
the
gods
are
propitious
to
them
and
this
is
due
not
to
me
but
to
themselves
i
and
the
god
only
assist
in
bringing
their
ideas
to
the
birth
many
of
them
have
left
me
too
soon
and
the
result
has
been
that
they
have
produced
abortions
or
when
i
have
delivered
them
of
children
they
have
lost
them
by
an
ill
bringing
up
and
have
ended
by
seeing
themselves
as
others
see
them
to
be
great
fools
aristides
the
son
of
lysimachus
is
one
of
these
and
there
have
been
others
the
truants
often
return
to
me
and
beg
to
be
taken
back
and
then
if
my
familiar
allows
me
which
is
not
always
the
case
i
receive
them
and
they
begin
to
grow
again
there
come
to
me
also
those
who
have
nothing
in
them
and
have
no
need
of
my
art
and
i
am
their
matchmaker
see
above
and
marry
them
to
prodicus
or
some
other
inspired
sage
who
is
likely
to
suit
them
i
tell
you
this
long
story
because
i
suspect
that
you
are
in
labour
come
then
to
me
who
am
a
midwife
and
the
son
of
a
midwife
and
i
will
deliver
you
and
do
not
bite
me
as
the
women
do
if
i
abstract
your
for
i
am
acting
out
of
towards
you
the
god
who
is
within
me
is
the
friend
of
man
though
he
will
not
allow
me
to
dissemble
the
truth
once
more
then
theaetetus
i
repeat
my
old
question
what
is
knowledge
take
courage
and
by
the
help
of
god
you
will
discover
an
answer
answer
is
that
knowledge
is
perception
is
the
theory
of
protagoras
who
has
another
way
of
expressing
the
same
thing
when
he
says
man
is
the
measure
of
all
things
he
was
a
very
wise
man
and
we
should
try
to
understand
him
in
order
to
illustrate
his
meaning
let
me
suppose
that
there
is
the
same
wind
blowing
in
our
faces
and
one
of
us
may
be
hot
and
the
other
cold
how
is
this
protagoras
will
reply
that
the
wind
is
hot
to
him
who
is
cold
cold
to
him
who
is
hot
and
is
means
appears
and
when
you
say
appears
to
him
that
means
he
feels
thus
feeling
appearance
perception
coincide
with
being
i
suspect
however
that
this
was
only
a
facon
de
parler
by
which
he
imposed
on
the
common
herd
like
you
and
me
he
told
the
truth
in
allusion
to
the
title
of
his
book
which
was
called
the
truth
in
secret
to
his
disciples
for
he
was
really
a
votary
of
that
famous
philosophy
in
which
all
things
are
said
to
be
relative
nothing
is
great
or
small
or
heavy
or
light
or
one
but
all
is
in
motion
and
mixture
and
transition
and
flux
and
generation
not
being
as
we
ignorantly
affirm
but
becoming
this
has
been
the
doctrine
not
of
protagoras
only
but
of
all
philosophers
with
the
single
exception
of
parmenides
empedocles
heracleitus
and
others
and
all
the
poets
with
epicharmus
the
king
of
comedy
and
homer
the
king
of
tragedy
at
their
head
have
said
the
same
the
latter
has
these
words
ocean
whence
the
gods
sprang
and
mother
tethys
and
many
arguments
are
used
to
show
that
motion
is
the
source
of
life
and
rest
of
death
fire
and
warmth
are
produced
by
friction
and
living
creatures
owe
their
origin
to
a
similar
cause
the
bodily
frame
is
preserved
by
exercise
and
destroyed
by
indolence
and
if
the
sun
ceased
to
move
chaos
would
come
again
now
apply
this
doctrine
of
all
is
motion
to
the
senses
and
first
of
all
to
the
sense
of
sight
the
colour
of
white
or
any
other
colour
is
neither
in
the
eyes
nor
out
of
them
but
ever
in
motion
between
the
object
and
the
eye
and
varying
in
the
case
of
every
percipient
all
is
relative
and
as
the
followers
of
protagoras
remark
endless
contradictions
arise
when
we
deny
this
here
are
six
dice
they
are
more
than
four
and
less
than
twelve
more
and
also
less
would
you
not
say
protagoras
will
retort
can
anything
be
more
or
less
without
addition
or
subtraction
should
say
no
if
i
were
not
afraid
of
contradicting
my
former
answer
if
you
say
yes
the
tongue
will
escape
conviction
but
not
the
mind
as
euripides
would
say
thoroughbred
sophists
who
know
all
that
can
be
known
would
have
a
sparring
match
over
this
but
you
and
i
who
have
no
professional
pride
want
only
to
discover
whether
our
ideas
are
clear
and
consistent
and
we
can
not
be
wrong
in
saying
first
that
nothing
can
be
greater
or
less
while
remaining
equal
secondly
that
there
can
be
no
becoming
greater
or
less
without
addition
or
subtraction
thirdly
that
what
is
and
was
not
can
not
be
without
having
become
but
then
how
is
this
reconcilable
with
the
case
of
the
dice
and
with
similar
examples
that
is
the
question
am
often
perplexed
and
amazed
socrates
by
these
difficulties
is
because
you
are
a
philosopher
for
philosophy
begins
in
wonder
and
iris
is
the
child
of
thaumas
do
you
know
the
original
principle
on
which
the
doctrine
of
protagoras
is
based
i
will
tell
you
but
we
must
not
let
the
uninitiated
hear
and
by
the
uninitiated
i
mean
the
obstinate
people
who
believe
in
nothing
which
they
can
not
hold
in
their
hands
the
brethren
whose
mysteries
i
am
about
to
unfold
to
you
are
far
more
ingenious
they
maintain
that
all
is
motion
and
that
motion
has
two
forms
action
and
passion
out
of
which
endless
phenomena
are
created
also
in
two
forms
sense
and
the
object
of
sense
which
come
to
the
birth
together
there
are
two
kinds
of
motions
a
slow
and
a
fast
the
motions
of
the
agent
and
the
patient
are
slower
because
they
move
and
create
in
and
about
themselves
but
the
things
which
are
born
of
them
have
a
swifter
motion
and
pass
rapidly
from
place
to
place
the
eye
and
the
appropriate
object
come
together
and
give
birth
to
whiteness
and
the
sensation
of
whiteness
the
eye
is
filled
with
seeing
and
becomes
not
sight
but
a
seeing
eye
and
the
object
is
filled
with
whiteness
and
becomes
not
whiteness
but
white
and
no
other
compound
of
either
with
another
would
have
produced
the
same
effect
all
sensation
is
to
be
resolved
into
a
similar
combination
of
an
agent
and
patient
of
either
taken
separately
no
idea
can
be
formed
and
the
agent
may
become
a
patient
and
the
patient
an
agent
hence
there
arises
a
general
reflection
that
nothing
is
but
all
things
become
no
name
can
detain
or
fix
them
are
not
these
speculations
charming
theaetetus
and
very
good
for
a
person
in
your
interesting
situation
i
am
offering
you
specimens
of
other
men
wisdom
because
i
have
no
wisdom
of
my
own
and
i
want
to
deliver
you
of
something
and
presently
we
will
see
whether
you
have
brought
forth
wind
or
not
tell
me
then
what
do
you
think
of
the
notion
that
all
things
are
becoming
i
hear
your
arguments
i
am
marvellously
ready
to
assent
i
ought
not
to
conceal
from
you
that
there
is
a
serious
objection
which
may
be
urged
against
this
doctrine
of
protagoras
for
there
are
states
such
as
madness
and
dreaming
in
which
perception
is
false
and
half
our
life
is
spent
in
dreaming
and
who
can
say
that
at
this
instant
we
are
not
dreaming
even
the
fancies
of
madmen
are
real
at
the
time
but
if
knowledge
is
perception
how
can
we
distinguish
between
the
true
and
the
false
in
such
cases
having
stated
the
objection
i
will
now
state
the
answer
protagoras
would
deny
the
continuity
of
phenomena
he
would
say
that
what
is
different
is
entirely
different
and
whether
active
or
passive
has
a
different
power
there
are
infinite
agents
and
patients
in
the
world
and
these
produce
in
every
combination
of
them
a
different
perception
take
myself
as
an
instance
socrates
may
be
ill
or
he
may
be
well
and
remember
that
socrates
with
all
his
accidents
is
spoken
of
the
wine
which
i
drink
when
i
am
well
is
pleasant
to
me
but
the
same
wine
is
unpleasant
to
me
when
i
am
and
there
is
nothing
else
from
which
i
can
receive
the
same
impression
nor
can
another
receive
the
same
impression
from
the
wine
neither
can
i
and
the
object
of
sense
become
separately
what
we
become
together
for
the
one
in
becoming
is
relative
to
the
other
but
they
have
no
other
relation
and
the
combination
of
them
is
absolute
at
each
moment
in
modern
language
the
act
of
sensation
is
really
indivisible
though
capable
of
a
mental
analysis
into
subject
and
object
my
sensation
alone
is
true
and
true
to
me
only
and
therefore
as
protagoras
says
to
myself
i
am
the
judge
of
what
is
and
what
is
not
thus
the
flux
of
homer
and
heracleitus
the
great
protagorean
saying
that
man
is
the
measure
of
all
things
the
doctrine
of
theaetetus
that
knowledge
is
perception
have
all
the
same
meaning
and
this
is
thy
child
which
by
my
art
i
have
brought
to
light
and
you
must
not
be
angry
if
instead
of
rearing
your
infant
we
expose
him
will
not
be
angry
says
theodorus
is
very
but
i
should
like
to
know
socrates
whether
you
mean
to
say
that
all
this
is
untrue
reminding
you
that
i
am
not
the
bag
which
contains
the
arguments
but
that
i
extract
them
from
theaetetus
shall
i
tell
you
what
amazes
me
in
your
friend
protagoras
may
that
be
like
his
doctrine
that
what
appears
is
but
i
wonder
that
he
did
not
begin
his
great
work
on
truth
with
a
declaration
that
a
pig
or
a
baboon
or
any
other
monster
which
has
sensation
is
a
measure
of
all
things
then
while
we
were
reverencing
him
as
a
god
he
might
have
produced
a
magnificent
effect
by
expounding
to
us
that
he
was
no
wiser
than
a
tadpole
for
if
sensations
are
always
true
and
one
discernment
is
as
good
as
another
and
every
man
is
his
own
judge
and
everything
that
he
judges
is
right
and
true
then
what
need
of
protagoras
to
be
our
instructor
at
a
high
figure
and
why
should
we
be
less
knowing
than
he
is
or
have
to
go
to
him
if
every
man
is
the
measure
of
all
things
my
own
art
of
midwifery
and
all
dialectic
is
an
enormous
folly
if
protagoras
truth
be
indeed
truth
and
the
philosopher
is
not
merely
amusing
himself
by
giving
oracles
out
of
his
book
theodorus
thinks
that
socrates
is
unjust
to
his
master
protagoras
but
he
is
too
old
and
stiff
to
try
a
fall
with
him
and
therefore
refers
him
to
theaetetus
who
is
already
driven
out
of
his
former
opinion
by
the
arguments
of
socrates
socrates
then
takes
up
the
defence
of
protagoras
who
is
supposed
to
reply
in
his
own
person
people
you
sit
and
declaim
about
the
gods
of
whose
existence
or
i
have
nothing
to
say
or
you
discourse
about
man
being
reduced
to
the
level
of
the
brutes
but
what
proof
have
you
of
your
statements
and
yet
surely
you
and
theodorus
had
better
reflect
whether
probability
is
a
safe
guide
theodorus
would
be
a
bad
geometrician
if
he
had
nothing
better
to
offer
theaetetus
is
affected
by
the
appeal
to
geometry
and
socrates
is
induced
by
him
to
put
the
question
in
a
new
form
he
proceeds
as
follows
we
say
that
we
know
what
we
see
and
hear
the
sound
of
words
or
the
sight
of
letters
in
a
foreign
tongue
should
say
that
the
figures
of
the
letters
and
the
pitch
of
the
voice
in
uttering
them
were
known
to
us
but
not
the
meaning
of
them
i
want
you
to
grow
and
therefore
i
will
leave
that
answer
and
ask
another
question
is
not
seeing
perceiving
true
he
who
sees
knows
he
who
remembers
remembers
that
which
he
sees
and
knows
true
if
he
closes
his
eyes
does
he
not
remember
does
he
may
remember
and
not
see
and
if
seeing
is
knowing
he
may
remember
and
not
know
is
not
this
a
reductio
ad
absurdum
of
the
hypothesis
that
knowledge
is
sensible
perception
yet
perhaps
we
are
crowing
too
soon
and
if
protagoras
the
father
of
the
myth
had
been
alive
the
result
might
have
been
very
different
but
he
is
dead
and
theodorus
whom
he
left
guardian
of
his
orphan
has
not
been
very
zealous
in
defending
him
theodorus
objects
that
callias
is
the
true
guardian
but
he
hopes
that
socrates
will
come
to
the
rescue
socrates
prefaces
his
defence
by
resuming
the
attack
he
asks
whether
a
man
can
know
and
not
know
at
the
same
time
quite
possible
if
you
maintain
that
seeing
is
knowing
the
confident
adversary
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
shuts
one
of
your
eyes
and
now
says
he
you
see
and
do
not
see
but
do
you
know
and
not
know
and
a
fresh
opponent
darts
from
his
ambush
and
transfers
to
knowledge
the
terms
which
are
commonly
applied
to
sight
he
asks
whether
you
can
know
near
and
not
at
a
distance
whether
you
can
have
a
sharp
and
also
a
dull
knowledge
while
you
are
wondering
at
his
incomparable
wisdom
he
gets
you
into
his
power
and
you
will
not
escape
until
you
have
come
to
an
understanding
with
him
about
the
money
which
is
to
be
paid
for
your
release
but
protagoras
has
not
yet
made
his
defence
and
already
he
may
be
heard
contemptuously
replying
that
he
is
not
responsible
for
the
admissions
which
were
made
by
a
boy
who
could
not
foresee
the
coming
move
and
therefore
had
answered
in
a
manner
which
enabled
socrates
to
raise
a
laugh
against
himself
i
can
not
be
fairly
charged
he
will
say
an
answer
which
i
should
not
have
given
for
i
never
maintained
that
the
memory
of
a
feeling
is
the
same
as
a
feeling
or
denied
that
a
man
might
know
and
not
know
the
same
thing
at
the
same
time
or
if
you
will
have
extreme
precision
i
say
that
man
in
different
relations
is
many
or
rather
infinite
in
number
and
i
challenge
you
either
to
show
that
his
perceptions
are
not
individual
or
that
if
they
are
what
appears
to
him
is
not
what
is
as
to
your
pigs
and
baboons
you
are
yourself
a
pig
and
you
make
my
writings
a
sport
of
other
swine
but
i
still
affirm
that
man
is
the
measure
of
all
things
although
i
admit
that
one
man
may
be
a
thousand
times
better
than
another
in
proportion
as
he
has
better
impressions
neither
do
i
deny
the
existence
of
wisdom
or
of
the
wise
man
but
i
maintain
that
wisdom
is
a
practical
remedial
power
of
turning
evil
into
good
the
bitterness
of
disease
into
the
sweetness
of
health
and
does
not
consist
in
any
greater
truth
or
superior
knowledge
for
the
impressions
of
the
sick
are
as
true
as
the
impressions
of
the
healthy
and
the
sick
are
as
wise
as
the
healthy
nor
can
any
man
be
cured
of
a
false
opinion
for
there
is
no
such
thing
but
he
may
be
cured
of
the
evil
habit
which
generates
in
him
an
evil
opinion
this
is
effected
in
the
body
by
the
drugs
of
the
physician
and
in
the
soul
by
the
words
of
the
sophist
and
the
new
state
or
opinion
is
not
truer
but
only
better
than
the
old
and
philosophers
are
not
tadpoles
but
physicians
and
husbandmen
who
till
the
soil
and
infuse
health
into
animals
and
plants
and
make
the
good
take
the
place
of
the
evil
both
in
individuals
and
states
wise
and
good
rhetoricians
make
the
good
to
appear
just
in
states
for
that
is
just
which
appears
just
to
a
state
and
in
return
they
deserve
to
be
well
paid
and
you
socrates
whether
you
please
or
not
must
continue
to
be
a
measure
this
is
my
defence
and
i
must
request
you
to
meet
me
fairly
we
are
professing
to
reason
and
not
merely
to
dispute
and
there
is
a
great
difference
between
reasoning
and
disputation
for
the
disputer
is
always
seeking
to
trip
up
his
opponent
and
this
is
a
mode
of
argument
which
disgusts
men
with
philosophy
as
they
grow
older
but
the
reasoner
is
trying
to
understand
him
and
to
point
out
his
errors
to
him
whether
arising
from
his
own
or
from
his
companion
fault
he
does
not
argue
from
the
customary
use
of
names
which
the
vulgar
pervert
in
all
manner
of
ways
if
you
are
gentle
to
an
adversary
he
will
follow
and
love
you
and
if
defeated
he
will
lay
the
blame
on
himself
and
seek
to
escape
from
his
own
prejudices
into
philosophy
i
would
recommend
you
socrates
to
adopt
this
humaner
method
and
to
avoid
captious
and
verbal
criticisms
such
theodorus
is
the
very
slight
help
which
i
am
able
to
afford
to
your
friend
had
he
been
alive
he
would
have
helped
himself
in
far
better
style
have
made
a
most
valorous
defence
yes
but
did
you
observe
that
protagoras
bade
me
be
serious
and
complained
of
our
getting
up
a
laugh
against
him
with
the
aid
of
a
boy
he
meant
to
intimate
that
you
must
take
the
place
of
theaetetus
who
may
be
wiser
than
many
bearded
men
but
not
wiser
than
you
theodorus
rule
of
the
spartan
palaestra
is
strip
or
depart
but
you
are
like
the
giant
antaeus
and
will
not
let
me
depart
unless
i
try
a
fall
with
you
yes
that
is
the
nature
of
my
complaint
and
many
a
hercules
many
a
theseus
mighty
in
deeds
and
words
has
broken
my
head
but
i
am
always
at
this
rough
game
please
then
to
favour
me
the
condition
of
not
exceeding
a
single
fall
i
consent
socrates
now
resumes
the
argument
as
he
is
very
desirous
of
doing
justice
to
protagoras
he
insists
on
citing
his
own
words
appears
to
each
man
is
to
him
and
how
asks
socrates
are
these
words
reconcileable
with
the
fact
that
all
mankind
are
agreed
in
thinking
themselves
wiser
than
others
in
some
respects
and
inferior
to
them
in
others
in
the
hour
of
danger
they
are
ready
to
fall
down
and
worship
any
one
who
is
their
superior
in
wisdom
as
if
he
were
a
god
and
the
world
is
full
of
men
who
are
asking
to
be
taught
and
willing
to
be
ruled
and
of
other
men
who
are
willing
to
rule
and
teach
them
all
which
implies
that
men
do
judge
of
one
another
impressions
and
think
some
wise
and
others
foolish
how
will
protagoras
answer
this
argument
for
he
can
not
say
that
no
one
deems
another
ignorant
or
mistaken
if
you
form
a
judgment
thousands
and
tens
of
thousands
are
ready
to
maintain
the
opposite
the
multitude
may
not
and
do
not
agree
in
own
thesis
that
is
the
measure
of
all
things
and
then
who
is
to
decide
upon
his
own
showing
must
not
his
depend
on
the
number
of
suffrages
and
be
more
or
less
true
in
proportion
as
he
has
more
or
fewer
of
them
and
he
must
acknowledge
further
that
they
speak
truly
who
deny
him
to
speak
truly
which
is
a
famous
jest
and
if
he
admits
that
they
speak
truly
who
deny
him
to
speak
truly
he
must
admit
that
he
himself
does
not
speak
truly
but
his
opponents
will
refuse
to
admit
this
of
themselves
and
he
must
allow
that
they
are
right
in
their
refusal
the
conclusion
is
that
all
mankind
including
protagoras
himself
will
deny
that
he
speaks
truly
and
his
truth
will
be
true
neither
to
himself
nor
to
anybody
else
theodorus
is
inclined
to
think
that
this
is
going
too
far
socrates
ironically
replies
that
he
is
not
going
beyond
the
truth
but
if
the
old
protagoras
could
only
pop
his
head
out
of
the
world
below
he
would
doubtless
give
them
both
a
sound
castigation
and
be
off
to
the
shades
in
an
instant
seeing
that
he
is
not
within
call
we
must
examine
the
question
for
ourselves
it
is
clear
that
there
are
great
differences
in
the
understandings
of
men
admitting
with
protagoras
that
immediate
sensations
of
hot
cold
and
the
like
are
to
each
one
such
as
they
appear
yet
this
hypothesis
can
not
be
extended
to
judgments
or
opinions
and
even
if
we
were
to
admit
further
and
this
is
the
view
of
some
who
are
not
followers
of
protagoras
that
right
and
wrong
holy
and
unholy
are
to
each
state
or
individual
such
as
they
appear
still
protagoras
will
not
venture
to
maintain
that
every
man
is
equally
the
measure
of
expediency
or
that
the
thing
which
seems
is
expedient
to
every
one
but
this
begins
a
new
question
socrates
we
have
plenty
of
leisure
yes
we
have
and
after
the
manner
of
philosophers
we
are
digressing
i
have
often
observed
how
ridiculous
this
habit
of
theirs
makes
them
when
they
appear
in
court
do
you
mean
i
mean
to
say
that
a
philosopher
is
a
gentleman
but
a
lawyer
is
a
servant
the
one
can
have
his
talk
out
and
wander
at
will
from
one
subject
to
another
as
the
fancy
takes
him
like
ourselves
he
may
be
long
or
short
as
he
pleases
but
the
lawyer
is
always
in
a
hurry
there
is
the
clepsydra
limiting
his
time
and
the
brief
limiting
his
topics
and
his
adversary
is
standing
over
him
and
exacting
his
rights
he
is
a
servant
disputing
about
a
before
his
master
who
holds
the
cause
in
his
hands
the
path
never
diverges
and
often
the
race
is
for
his
life
such
experiences
render
him
keen
and
shrewd
he
learns
the
arts
of
flattery
and
is
perfect
in
the
practice
of
crooked
ways
dangers
have
come
upon
him
too
soon
when
the
tenderness
of
youth
was
unable
to
meet
them
with
truth
and
honesty
and
he
has
resorted
to
of
dishonesty
and
falsehood
and
become
warped
and
distorted
without
any
health
or
freedom
or
sincerity
in
him
he
has
grown
up
to
manhood
and
is
or
esteems
himself
to
be
a
master
of
cunning
such
are
the
lawyers
will
you
have
the
companion
picture
of
philosophers
or
will
this
be
too
much
of
a
digression
socrates
the
argument
is
our
servant
and
not
our
master
who
is
the
judge
or
where
is
the
spectator
having
a
right
to
control
us
i
will
describe
the
leaders
then
for
the
inferior
sort
are
not
worth
the
trouble
the
lords
of
philosophy
have
not
learned
the
way
to
the
dicastery
or
ecclesia
they
neither
see
nor
hear
the
laws
and
votes
of
the
state
written
or
recited
societies
whether
political
or
festive
clubs
and
singing
maidens
do
not
enter
even
into
their
dreams
and
the
scandals
of
persons
or
their
ancestors
male
and
female
they
know
no
more
than
they
can
tell
the
number
of
pints
in
the
ocean
neither
are
they
conscious
of
their
own
ignorance
for
they
do
not
practise
singularity
in
order
to
gain
reputation
but
the
truth
is
that
the
outer
form
of
them
only
is
residing
in
the
city
the
inner
man
as
pindar
says
is
going
on
a
voyage
of
discovery
measuring
as
with
line
and
rule
the
things
which
are
under
and
in
the
earth
interrogating
the
whole
of
nature
only
not
condescending
to
notice
what
is
near
them
do
you
mean
socrates
i
will
illustrate
my
meaning
by
the
jest
of
the
witty
who
saw
thales
tumbling
into
a
well
and
said
of
him
that
he
was
so
eager
to
know
what
was
going
on
in
heaven
that
he
could
not
see
what
was
before
his
feet
this
is
applicable
to
all
philosophers
the
philosopher
is
unacquainted
with
the
world
he
hardly
knows
whether
his
neighbour
is
a
man
or
an
animal
for
he
is
always
searching
into
the
essence
of
man
and
enquiring
what
such
a
nature
ought
to
do
or
suffer
different
from
any
other
hence
on
every
occasion
in
private
life
and
public
as
i
was
saying
when
he
appears
in
a
or
anywhere
he
is
the
joke
not
only
of
but
of
the
general
herd
falling
into
wells
and
every
sort
of
disaster
he
looks
such
an
awkward
inexperienced
creature
unable
to
say
anything
personal
when
he
is
abused
in
answer
to
his
adversaries
for
he
knows
no
evil
of
any
one
and
when
he
hears
the
praises
of
others
he
can
not
help
laughing
from
the
bottom
of
his
soul
at
their
pretensions
and
this
also
gives
him
a
ridiculous
appearance
a
king
or
tyrant
appears
to
him
to
be
a
kind
of
or
milking
away
at
an
animal
who
is
much
more
troublesome
and
dangerous
than
cows
or
sheep
like
the
he
has
no
time
to
be
educated
and
the
pen
in
which
he
keeps
his
flock
in
the
mountains
is
surrounded
by
a
wall
when
he
hears
of
large
landed
properties
of
ten
thousand
acres
or
more
he
thinks
of
the
whole
earth
or
if
he
is
told
of
the
antiquity
of
a
family
he
remembers
that
every
one
has
had
myriads
of
progenitors
rich
and
poor
greeks
and
barbarians
kings
and
slaves
and
he
who
boasts
of
his
descent
from
amphitryon
in
the
generation
may
if
he
pleases
add
as
many
more
and
double
that
again
and
our
philosopher
only
laughs
at
his
inability
to
do
a
larger
sum
such
is
the
man
at
whom
the
vulgar
scoff
he
seems
to
them
as
if
he
could
not
mind
his
feet
is
very
true
socrates
but
when
he
tries
to
draw
the
lawyer
out
of
his
pleas
and
rejoinders
to
the
contemplation
of
absolute
justice
or
injustice
in
their
own
nature
or
from
the
popular
praises
of
wealthy
kings
to
the
view
of
happiness
and
misery
in
themselves
or
to
the
reasons
why
a
man
should
seek
after
the
one
and
avoid
the
other
then
the
situation
is
reversed
the
little
wretch
turns
giddy
and
is
ready
to
fall
over
the
precipice
his
utterance
becomes
thick
and
he
makes
himself
ridiculous
not
to
but
to
every
man
of
liberal
education
such
are
the
two
pictures
the
one
of
the
philosopher
and
gentleman
who
may
be
excused
for
not
having
learned
how
to
make
a
bed
or
cook
up
flatteries
the
other
a
serviceable
knave
who
hardly
knows
how
to
wear
his
cloak
still
less
can
he
awaken
harmonious
thoughts
or
hymn
praises
the
world
socrates
were
as
ready
to
receive
your
words
as
i
am
there
would
be
greater
peace
and
less
evil
among
mankind
evil
theodorus
must
ever
remain
in
this
world
to
be
the
antagonist
of
good
out
of
the
way
of
the
gods
in
heaven
wherefore
also
we
should
fly
away
from
ourselves
to
them
and
to
fly
to
them
is
to
become
like
them
and
to
become
like
them
is
to
become
holy
just
and
true
but
many
live
in
the
old
wives
fable
of
appearances
they
think
that
you
should
follow
virtue
in
order
that
you
may
seem
to
be
good
and
yet
the
truth
is
that
god
is
righteous
and
of
men
he
is
most
like
him
who
is
most
righteous
to
know
this
is
wisdom
and
in
comparison
of
this
the
wisdom
of
the
arts
or
the
seeming
wisdom
of
politicians
is
mean
and
common
the
unrighteous
man
is
apt
to
pride
himself
on
his
cunning
when
others
call
him
rogue
he
says
to
himself
only
mean
that
i
am
one
who
deserves
to
live
and
not
a
mere
burden
of
the
earth
but
he
should
reflect
that
his
ignorance
makes
his
condition
worse
than
if
he
knew
for
the
penalty
of
injustice
is
not
death
or
stripes
but
the
fatal
necessity
of
becoming
more
and
more
unjust
two
patterns
of
life
are
set
before
him
the
one
blessed
and
divine
the
other
godless
and
wretched
and
he
is
growing
more
and
more
like
the
one
and
unlike
the
other
he
does
not
see
that
if
he
continues
in
his
cunning
the
place
of
innocence
will
not
receive
him
after
death
and
yet
if
such
a
man
has
the
courage
to
hear
the
argument
out
he
often
becomes
dissatisfied
with
himself
and
has
no
more
strength
in
him
than
a
but
we
have
digressed
enough
my
part
socrates
i
like
the
digressions
better
than
the
argument
because
i
understand
them
better
to
return
when
we
left
off
the
protagoreans
and
heracliteans
were
maintaining
that
the
ordinances
of
the
state
were
just
while
they
lasted
but
no
one
would
maintain
that
the
laws
of
the
state
were
always
good
or
expedient
although
this
may
be
the
intention
of
them
for
the
expedient
has
to
do
with
the
future
about
which
we
are
liable
to
mistake
now
would
protagoras
maintain
that
man
is
the
measure
not
only
of
the
present
and
past
but
of
the
future
and
that
there
is
no
difference
in
the
judgments
of
men
about
the
future
would
an
untrained
man
for
example
be
as
likely
to
know
when
he
is
going
to
have
a
fever
as
the
physician
who
attended
him
and
if
they
differ
in
opinion
which
of
them
is
likely
to
be
right
or
are
they
both
right
is
not
a
a
better
judge
of
a
vintage
which
is
not
yet
gathered
or
a
cook
of
a
dinner
which
is
in
preparation
or
protagoras
of
the
probable
effect
of
a
speech
than
an
ordinary
person
the
last
example
speaks
hominen
for
protagoras
would
never
have
amassed
a
fortune
if
every
man
could
judge
of
the
future
for
himself
he
is
therefore
compelled
to
admit
that
he
is
a
measure
but
i
who
know
nothing
am
not
equally
convinced
that
i
am
this
is
one
way
of
refuting
him
and
he
is
refuted
also
by
the
authority
which
he
attributes
to
the
opinions
of
others
who
deny
his
opinions
i
am
not
equally
sure
that
we
can
disprove
the
truth
of
immediate
states
of
feeling
but
this
leads
us
to
the
doctrine
of
the
universal
flux
about
which
a
is
always
going
on
in
the
cities
of
ionia
the
ephesians
are
downright
mad
about
the
flux
they
can
not
stop
to
argue
with
you
but
are
in
perpetual
motion
obedient
to
their
their
restlessness
is
beyond
expression
and
if
you
ask
any
of
them
a
question
they
will
not
answer
but
dart
at
you
some
unintelligible
saying
and
another
and
another
making
no
way
either
with
themselves
or
with
others
for
nothing
is
fixed
in
them
or
their
ideas
they
are
at
war
with
fixed
principles
i
suppose
theodorus
that
you
have
never
seen
them
in
time
of
peace
when
they
discourse
at
leisure
to
their
disciples
they
have
none
they
are
a
set
of
uneducated
fanatics
and
each
of
them
says
of
the
other
that
they
have
no
knowledge
we
must
trust
to
ourselves
and
not
to
them
for
the
solution
of
the
problem
well
the
doctrine
is
old
being
derived
from
the
poets
who
speak
in
a
figure
of
oceanus
and
tethys
the
truth
was
once
concealed
but
is
now
revealed
by
the
superior
wisdom
of
a
later
generation
and
made
intelligible
to
the
cobbler
who
on
hearing
that
all
is
in
motion
and
not
some
things
only
as
he
ignorantly
fancied
may
be
expected
to
fall
down
and
worship
his
teachers
and
the
opposite
doctrine
must
not
be
forgotten
being
remains
unmoved
which
is
the
name
for
all
as
parmenides
affirms
thus
we
are
in
the
midst
of
the
fray
both
parties
are
dragging
us
to
their
side
and
we
are
not
certain
which
of
them
are
in
the
right
and
if
neither
then
we
shall
be
in
a
ridiculous
position
having
to
set
up
our
own
opinion
against
ancient
and
famous
men
let
us
first
approach
the
or
patrons
of
the
flux
when
they
speak
of
motion
must
they
not
include
two
kinds
of
motion
change
of
place
and
change
of
nature
and
all
things
must
be
supposed
to
have
both
kinds
of
motion
for
if
not
the
same
things
would
be
at
rest
and
in
motion
which
is
contrary
to
their
theory
and
did
we
not
say
that
all
sensations
arise
thus
they
move
about
between
the
agent
and
patient
together
with
a
perception
and
the
patient
ceases
to
be
a
perceiving
power
and
becomes
a
percipient
and
the
agent
a
quale
instead
of
a
quality
but
neither
has
any
absolute
existence
but
now
we
make
the
further
discovery
that
neither
white
or
whiteness
nor
any
sense
or
sensation
can
be
predicated
of
anything
for
they
are
in
a
perpetual
flux
and
therefore
we
must
modify
the
doctrine
of
theaetetus
and
protagoras
by
asserting
further
that
knowledge
is
and
is
not
sensation
and
of
everything
we
must
say
equally
that
this
is
and
is
not
or
becomes
or
becomes
not
and
still
the
word
is
not
quite
correct
for
language
fails
in
the
attempt
to
express
their
meaning
at
the
close
of
the
discussion
theodorus
claims
to
be
released
from
the
argument
according
to
his
agreement
but
theaetetus
insists
that
they
shall
proceed
to
consider
the
doctrine
of
rest
this
is
declined
by
socrates
who
has
too
much
reverence
for
the
great
parmenides
lightly
to
attack
him
we
shall
find
that
he
returns
to
the
doctrine
of
rest
in
the
sophist
but
at
present
he
does
not
wish
to
be
diverted
from
his
main
purpose
which
is
to
deliver
theaetetus
of
his
conception
of
knowledge
he
proceeds
to
interrogate
him
further
when
he
says
that
is
in
perception
with
what
does
he
perceive
the
first
answer
is
that
he
perceives
sights
with
the
eye
and
sounds
with
the
ear
this
leads
socrates
to
make
the
reflection
that
nice
distinctions
of
words
are
sometimes
pedantic
but
sometimes
necessary
and
he
proposes
in
this
case
to
substitute
the
word
for
for
the
senses
are
not
like
the
trojan
warriors
in
the
horse
but
have
a
common
centre
of
perception
in
which
they
all
meet
this
common
principle
is
able
to
compare
them
with
one
another
and
must
therefore
be
distinct
from
them
compare
republic
and
as
there
are
facts
of
sense
which
are
perceived
through
the
organs
of
the
body
there
are
also
mathematical
and
other
abstractions
such
as
sameness
and
difference
likeness
and
unlikeness
which
the
soul
perceives
by
herself
being
is
the
most
universal
of
these
abstractions
the
good
and
the
beautiful
are
abstractions
of
another
kind
which
exist
in
relation
and
which
above
all
others
the
mind
perceives
in
herself
comparing
within
her
past
present
and
future
for
example
we
know
a
thing
to
be
hard
or
soft
by
the
touch
of
which
the
perception
is
given
at
birth
to
men
and
animals
but
the
essence
of
hardness
or
softness
or
the
fact
that
this
hardness
is
and
is
the
opposite
of
softness
is
slowly
learned
by
reflection
and
experience
mere
perception
does
not
reach
being
and
therefore
fails
of
truth
and
therefore
has
no
share
in
knowledge
but
if
so
knowledge
is
not
perception
what
then
is
knowledge
the
mind
when
occupied
by
herself
with
being
is
said
to
have
opinion
shall
we
say
that
is
true
opinion
but
still
an
old
difficulty
recurs
we
ask
ourselves
is
false
opinion
possible
this
difficulty
may
be
stated
as
follows
either
we
know
or
do
not
know
a
thing
for
the
intermediate
processes
of
learning
and
forgetting
need
not
at
present
be
considered
and
in
thinking
or
having
an
opinion
we
must
either
know
or
not
know
that
which
we
think
and
we
can
not
know
and
be
ignorant
at
the
same
time
we
can
not
confuse
one
thing
which
we
do
not
know
with
another
thing
which
we
do
not
know
nor
can
we
think
that
which
we
do
not
know
to
be
that
which
we
know
or
that
which
we
know
to
be
that
which
we
do
not
know
and
what
other
case
is
conceivable
upon
the
supposition
that
we
either
know
or
do
not
know
all
things
let
us
try
another
answer
in
the
sphere
of
being
a
man
thinks
and
thinks
that
which
is
not
but
would
this
hold
in
any
parallel
case
can
a
man
see
and
see
nothing
or
hear
and
hear
nothing
or
touch
and
touch
nothing
must
he
not
see
hear
or
touch
some
one
existing
thing
for
if
he
thinks
about
nothing
he
does
not
think
and
not
thinking
he
can
not
think
falsely
and
so
the
path
of
being
is
closed
against
us
as
well
as
the
path
of
knowledge
but
may
there
not
be
or
transference
of
opinion
i
mean
may
not
one
thing
be
supposed
to
be
another
theaetetus
is
confident
that
this
must
be
true
falsehood
when
a
man
puts
good
for
evil
or
evil
for
good
socrates
will
not
discourage
him
by
attacking
the
paradoxical
expression
falsehood
but
passes
on
the
new
notion
involves
a
process
of
thinking
about
two
things
either
together
or
alternately
and
thinking
is
the
conversing
of
the
mind
with
herself
which
is
carried
on
in
question
and
answer
until
she
no
longer
doubts
but
determines
and
forms
an
opinion
and
false
opinion
consists
in
saying
to
yourself
that
one
thing
is
another
but
did
you
ever
say
to
yourself
that
good
is
evil
or
evil
good
even
in
sleep
did
you
ever
imagine
that
odd
was
even
or
did
any
man
in
his
senses
ever
fancy
that
an
ox
was
a
horse
or
that
two
are
one
so
that
we
can
never
think
one
thing
to
be
another
for
you
must
not
meet
me
with
the
verbal
quibble
that
one
eteron
is
other
eteron
both
and
in
greek
are
called
eteron
he
who
has
both
the
two
things
in
his
mind
can
not
misplace
them
and
he
who
has
only
one
of
them
in
his
mind
can
not
misplace
them
on
either
supposition
transplacement
is
inconceivable
but
perhaps
there
may
still
be
a
sense
in
which
we
can
think
that
which
we
do
not
know
to
be
that
which
we
know
theaetetus
may
know
socrates
but
at
a
distance
he
may
mistake
another
person
for
him
this
process
may
be
conceived
by
the
help
of
an
image
let
us
suppose
that
every
man
has
in
his
mind
a
block
of
wax
of
various
qualities
the
gift
of
memory
the
mother
of
the
muses
and
on
this
he
receives
the
seal
or
stamp
of
those
sensations
and
perceptions
which
he
wishes
to
remember
that
which
he
succeeds
in
stamping
is
remembered
and
known
by
him
as
long
as
the
impression
lasts
but
that
of
which
the
impression
is
rubbed
out
or
imperfectly
made
is
forgotten
and
not
known
no
one
can
think
one
thing
to
be
another
when
he
has
the
memorial
or
seal
of
both
of
these
in
his
soul
and
a
sensible
impression
of
neither
or
when
he
knows
one
and
does
not
know
the
other
and
has
no
memorial
or
seal
of
the
other
or
when
he
knows
neither
or
when
he
perceives
both
or
one
and
not
the
other
or
neither
or
when
he
perceives
and
knows
both
and
identifies
what
he
perceives
with
what
he
knows
this
is
still
more
impossible
or
when
he
does
not
know
one
and
does
not
know
and
does
not
perceive
the
other
or
does
not
perceive
one
and
does
not
know
and
does
not
perceive
the
other
or
has
no
perception
or
knowledge
of
either
all
these
cases
must
be
excluded
but
he
may
err
when
he
confuses
what
he
knows
or
perceives
or
what
he
perceives
and
does
not
know
with
what
he
knows
or
what
he
knows
and
perceives
with
what
he
knows
and
perceives
theaetetus
is
unable
to
follow
these
distinctions
which
socrates
proceeds
to
illustrate
by
examples
first
of
all
remarking
that
knowledge
may
exist
without
perception
and
perception
without
knowledge
i
may
know
theodorus
and
theaetetus
and
not
see
them
i
may
see
them
and
not
know
them
i
understand
but
i
could
not
mistake
one
for
the
other
if
i
knew
you
both
and
had
no
perception
of
either
or
if
i
knew
one
only
and
perceived
neither
or
if
i
knew
and
perceived
neither
or
in
any
other
of
the
excluded
cases
the
only
possibility
of
error
is
when
knowing
you
and
theodorus
and
having
the
impression
of
both
of
you
on
the
waxen
block
i
seeing
you
both
imperfectly
and
at
a
distance
put
the
foot
in
the
wrong
shoe
that
is
to
say
put
the
seal
or
stamp
on
the
wrong
object
or
when
knowing
both
of
you
i
only
see
one
or
when
seeing
and
knowing
you
both
i
fail
to
identify
the
impression
and
the
object
but
there
could
be
no
error
when
perception
and
knowledge
correspond
the
waxen
block
in
the
heart
of
a
man
soul
as
i
may
say
in
the
words
of
homer
who
played
upon
the
words
ker
and
keros
may
be
smooth
and
deep
and
large
enough
and
then
the
signs
are
clearly
marked
and
lasting
and
do
not
get
confused
but
in
the
heart
as
the
poet
sings
when
the
wax
is
muddy
or
hard
or
moist
there
is
a
corresponding
confusion
and
want
of
retentiveness
in
the
muddy
and
impure
there
is
indistinctness
and
still
more
in
the
hard
for
there
the
impressions
have
no
depth
of
wax
and
in
the
moist
they
are
too
soon
effaced
yet
greater
is
the
indistinctness
when
they
are
all
jolted
together
in
a
little
soul
which
is
narrow
and
has
no
room
these
are
the
sort
of
natures
which
have
false
opinion
from
stupidity
they
see
and
hear
and
think
amiss
and
this
is
falsehood
and
ignorance
error
then
is
a
confusion
of
thought
and
sense
theaetetus
is
delighted
with
this
explanation
but
socrates
has
no
sooner
found
the
new
solution
than
he
sinks
into
a
fit
of
despondency
for
an
objection
occurs
to
him
may
there
not
be
errors
where
there
is
no
confusion
of
mind
and
sense
in
numbers
no
one
can
confuse
the
man
whom
he
has
in
his
thoughts
with
the
horse
which
he
has
in
his
thoughts
but
he
may
err
in
the
addition
of
five
and
seven
and
observe
that
these
are
purely
mental
conceptions
thus
we
are
involved
once
more
in
the
dilemma
of
saying
either
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
false
opinion
or
that
a
man
knows
what
he
does
not
know
we
are
at
our
wit
end
and
may
therefore
be
excused
for
making
a
bold
diversion
all
this
time
we
have
been
repeating
the
words
yet
we
do
not
know
what
knowledge
is
socrates
how
can
you
argue
at
all
without
using
them
nay
but
the
true
hero
of
dialectic
would
have
forbidden
me
to
use
them
until
i
had
explained
them
and
i
must
explain
them
now
the
verb
know
has
two
senses
to
have
and
to
possess
knowledge
and
i
distinguish
from
a
man
may
possess
a
garment
which
he
does
not
wear
or
he
may
have
wild
birds
in
an
aviary
these
in
one
sense
he
possesses
and
in
another
he
has
none
of
them
let
this
aviary
be
an
image
of
the
mind
as
the
waxen
block
was
when
we
are
young
the
aviary
is
empty
after
a
time
the
birds
are
put
in
for
under
this
figure
we
may
describe
different
forms
of
knowledge
there
are
some
of
them
in
groups
and
some
single
which
are
flying
about
everywhere
and
let
us
suppose
a
hunt
after
the
science
of
odd
and
even
or
some
other
science
the
possession
of
the
birds
is
clearly
not
the
same
as
the
having
them
in
the
hand
and
the
original
chase
of
them
is
not
the
same
as
taking
them
in
the
hand
when
they
are
already
caged
this
distinction
between
use
and
possession
saves
us
from
the
absurdity
of
supposing
that
we
do
not
know
what
we
know
because
we
may
know
in
one
sense
possess
what
we
do
not
know
in
another
use
but
have
we
not
escaped
one
difficulty
only
to
encounter
a
greater
for
how
can
the
exchange
of
two
kinds
of
knowledge
ever
become
false
opinion
as
well
might
we
suppose
that
ignorance
could
make
a
man
know
or
that
blindness
could
make
him
see
theaetetus
suggests
that
in
the
aviary
there
may
be
flying
about
mock
birds
or
forms
of
ignorance
and
we
put
forth
our
hands
and
grasp
ignorance
when
we
are
intending
to
grasp
knowledge
but
how
can
he
who
knows
the
forms
of
knowledge
and
the
forms
of
ignorance
imagine
one
to
be
the
other
is
there
some
other
form
of
knowledge
which
distinguishes
them
and
another
and
another
thus
we
go
round
and
round
in
a
circle
and
make
no
progress
all
this
confusion
arises
out
of
our
attempt
to
explain
false
opinion
without
having
explained
knowledge
what
then
is
knowledge
theaetetus
repeats
that
knowledge
is
true
opinion
but
this
seems
to
be
refuted
by
the
instance
of
orators
and
judges
for
surely
the
orator
can
not
convey
a
true
knowledge
of
crimes
at
which
the
judges
were
not
present
he
can
only
persuade
them
and
the
judge
may
form
a
true
opinion
and
truly
judge
but
if
true
opinion
were
knowledge
they
could
not
have
judged
without
knowledge
once
more
theaetetus
offers
a
definition
which
he
has
heard
knowledge
is
true
opinion
accompanied
by
definition
or
explanation
socrates
has
had
a
similar
dream
and
has
further
heard
that
the
first
elements
are
names
only
and
that
definition
or
explanation
begins
when
they
are
combined
the
letters
are
unknown
the
syllables
or
combinations
are
known
but
this
new
hypothesis
when
tested
by
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
is
found
to
break
down
the
first
syllable
of
socrates
name
is
so
but
what
is
so
two
letters
s
and
o
a
sibilant
and
a
vowel
of
which
no
further
explanation
can
be
given
and
how
can
any
one
be
ignorant
of
either
of
them
and
yet
know
both
of
them
there
is
however
another
alternative
we
may
suppose
that
the
syllable
has
a
separate
form
or
idea
distinct
from
the
letters
or
parts
the
all
of
the
parts
may
not
be
the
whole
theaetetus
is
very
much
inclined
to
adopt
this
suggestion
but
when
interrogated
by
socrates
he
is
unable
to
draw
any
distinction
between
the
whole
and
all
the
parts
and
if
the
syllables
have
no
parts
then
they
are
those
original
elements
of
which
there
is
no
explanation
but
how
can
the
syllable
be
known
if
the
letter
remains
unknown
in
learning
to
read
as
children
we
are
first
taught
the
letters
and
then
the
syllables
and
in
music
the
notes
which
are
the
letters
have
a
much
more
distinct
meaning
to
us
than
the
combination
of
them
once
more
then
we
must
ask
the
meaning
of
the
statement
that
is
right
opinion
accompanied
by
explanation
or
definition
explanation
may
mean
the
reflection
or
expression
of
a
thoughts
but
every
man
who
is
not
deaf
and
dumb
is
able
to
express
his
thoughts
or
the
enumeration
of
the
elements
of
which
anything
is
composed
a
man
may
have
a
true
opinion
about
a
waggon
but
then
and
then
only
has
he
knowledge
of
a
waggon
when
he
is
able
to
enumerate
the
hundred
planks
of
hesiod
or
he
may
know
the
syllables
of
the
name
theaetetus
but
not
the
letters
yet
not
until
he
knows
both
can
he
be
said
to
have
knowledge
as
well
as
opinion
but
on
the
other
hand
he
may
know
the
syllable
in
the
name
theaetetus
yet
he
may
be
mistaken
about
the
same
syllable
in
the
name
theodorus
and
in
learning
to
read
we
often
make
such
mistakes
and
even
if
he
could
write
out
all
the
letters
and
syllables
of
your
name
in
order
still
he
would
only
have
right
opinion
yet
there
may
be
a
third
meaning
of
the
definition
besides
the
image
or
expression
of
the
mind
and
the
enumeration
of
the
elements
viz
perception
of
difference
for
example
i
may
see
a
man
who
has
eyes
nose
and
mouth
that
will
not
distinguish
him
from
any
other
man
or
he
may
have
a
and
prominent
eyes
that
will
not
distinguish
him
from
myself
and
you
and
others
who
are
like
me
but
when
i
see
a
certain
kind
of
then
i
recognize
theaetetus
and
having
this
sign
of
difference
i
have
knowledge
but
have
i
knowledge
or
opinion
of
this
difference
if
i
have
only
opinion
i
have
not
knowledge
if
i
have
knowledge
we
assume
a
disputed
term
for
knowledge
will
have
to
be
defined
as
right
opinion
with
knowledge
of
difference
and
so
theaetetus
knowledge
is
neither
perception
nor
true
opinion
nor
yet
definition
accompanying
true
opinion
and
i
have
shown
that
the
children
of
your
brain
are
not
worth
rearing
are
you
still
in
labour
or
have
you
brought
all
you
have
to
say
about
knowledge
to
the
birth
if
you
have
any
more
thoughts
you
will
be
the
better
for
having
got
rid
of
these
or
if
you
have
none
you
will
be
the
better
for
not
fancying
that
you
know
what
you
do
not
know
observe
the
limits
of
my
art
which
like
my
mother
is
an
art
of
midwifery
i
do
not
pretend
to
compare
with
the
good
and
wise
of
this
and
other
ages
and
now
i
go
to
meet
meletus
at
the
porch
of
the
king
archon
but
i
shall
hope
to
see
you
again
theodorus
at
this
place
i
the
saying
of
theaetetus
that
is
sensible
perception
may
be
assumed
to
be
a
current
philosophical
opinion
of
the
age
ancients
as
aristotle
de
anim
says
citing
a
verse
of
empedocles
knowledge
to
be
the
same
as
perception
we
may
now
examine
these
words
first
with
reference
to
their
place
in
the
history
of
philosophy
and
secondly
in
relation
to
modern
speculations
a
in
the
age
of
socrates
the
mind
was
passing
from
the
object
to
the
subject
the
same
impulse
which
a
century
before
had
led
men
to
form
conceptions
of
the
world
now
led
them
to
frame
general
notions
of
the
human
faculties
and
feelings
such
as
memory
opinion
and
the
like
the
simplest
of
these
is
sensation
or
sensible
perception
by
which
plato
seems
to
mean
the
generalized
notion
of
feelings
and
impressions
of
sense
without
determining
whether
they
are
conscious
or
not
the
theory
that
is
sensible
perception
is
the
antithesis
of
that
which
derives
knowledge
from
the
mind
theaet
or
which
assumes
the
existence
of
ideas
independent
of
the
mind
yet
from
their
extreme
abstraction
these
theories
do
not
represent
the
opposite
poles
of
thought
in
the
same
way
that
the
corresponding
differences
would
in
modern
philosophy
the
most
ideal
and
the
most
sensational
have
a
tendency
to
pass
into
one
another
heracleitus
like
his
great
successor
hegel
has
both
aspects
the
eleatic
isolation
of
being
and
the
megarian
or
cynic
isolation
of
individuals
are
placed
in
the
same
class
by
plato
soph
and
the
same
principle
which
is
the
symbol
of
motion
to
one
mind
is
the
symbol
of
rest
to
another
the
atomists
who
are
sometimes
regarded
as
the
materialists
of
plato
denied
the
reality
of
sensation
and
in
the
ancient
as
well
as
the
modern
world
there
were
reactions
from
theory
to
experience
from
ideas
to
sense
this
is
a
point
of
view
from
which
the
philosophy
of
sensation
presented
great
attraction
to
the
ancient
thinker
amid
the
conflict
of
ideas
and
the
variety
of
opinions
the
impression
of
sense
remained
certain
and
uniform
hardness
softness
cold
heat
etc
are
not
absolutely
the
same
to
different
persons
but
the
art
of
measuring
could
at
any
rate
reduce
them
all
to
definite
natures
republic
thus
the
doctrine
that
knowledge
is
perception
supplies
or
seems
to
supply
a
firm
standing
ground
like
the
other
notions
of
the
earlier
greek
philosophy
it
was
held
in
a
very
simple
way
without
much
basis
of
reasoning
and
without
suggesting
the
questions
which
naturally
arise
in
our
own
minds
on
the
same
subject
b
the
fixedness
of
impressions
of
sense
furnishes
a
link
of
connexion
between
ancient
and
modern
philosophy
the
modern
thinker
often
repeats
the
parallel
axiom
knowledge
is
experience
he
means
to
say
that
the
outward
and
not
the
inward
is
both
the
original
source
and
the
final
criterion
of
truth
because
the
outward
can
be
observed
and
analyzed
the
inward
is
only
known
by
external
results
and
is
dimly
perceived
by
each
man
for
himself
in
what
does
this
differ
from
the
saying
of
theaetetus
chiefly
in
this
that
the
modern
term
while
implying
a
point
of
departure
in
sense
and
a
return
to
sense
also
includes
all
the
processes
of
reasoning
and
imagination
which
have
intervened
the
necessary
connexion
between
them
by
no
means
affords
a
measure
of
the
relative
degree
of
importance
which
is
to
be
ascribed
to
either
element
for
the
inductive
portion
of
any
science
may
be
small
as
in
mathematics
or
ethics
compared
with
that
which
the
mind
has
attained
by
reasoning
and
reflection
on
a
very
few
facts
ii
the
saying
that
knowledge
is
sensation
is
identified
by
plato
with
the
protagorean
thesis
that
is
the
measure
of
all
things
the
interpretation
which
protagoras
himself
is
supposed
to
give
of
these
latter
words
is
are
to
me
as
they
appear
to
me
and
to
you
as
they
appear
to
you
but
there
remains
still
an
ambiguity
both
in
the
text
and
in
the
explanation
which
has
to
be
cleared
up
did
protagoras
merely
mean
to
assert
the
relativity
of
knowledge
to
the
human
mind
or
did
he
mean
to
deny
that
there
is
an
objective
standard
of
truth
these
two
questions
have
not
been
always
clearly
distinguished
the
relativity
of
knowledge
has
been
sometimes
confounded
with
uncertainty
the
untutored
mind
is
apt
to
suppose
that
objects
exist
independently
of
the
human
faculties
because
they
really
exist
independently
of
the
faculties
of
any
individual
in
the
same
way
knowledge
appears
to
be
a
body
of
truths
stored
up
in
books
which
when
once
ascertained
are
independent
of
the
discoverer
further
consideration
shows
us
that
these
truths
are
not
really
independent
of
the
mind
there
is
an
adaptation
of
one
to
the
other
of
the
eye
to
the
object
of
sense
of
the
mind
to
the
conception
there
would
be
no
world
if
there
neither
were
nor
ever
had
been
any
one
to
perceive
the
world
a
slight
effort
of
reflection
enables
us
to
understand
this
but
no
effort
of
reflection
will
enable
us
to
pass
beyond
the
limits
of
our
own
faculties
or
to
imagine
the
relation
or
adaptation
of
objects
to
the
mind
to
be
different
from
that
of
which
we
have
experience
there
are
certain
laws
of
language
and
logic
to
which
we
are
compelled
to
conform
and
to
which
our
ideas
naturally
adapt
themselves
and
we
can
no
more
get
rid
of
them
than
we
can
cease
to
be
ourselves
the
absolute
and
infinite
whether
explained
as
or
as
the
totality
of
human
thought
or
as
the
divine
nature
if
known
to
us
at
all
can
not
escape
from
the
category
of
relation
but
because
knowledge
is
subjective
or
relative
to
the
mind
we
are
not
to
suppose
that
we
are
therefore
deprived
of
any
of
the
tests
or
criteria
of
truth
one
man
still
remains
wiser
than
another
a
more
accurate
observer
and
relater
of
facts
a
truer
measure
of
the
proportions
of
knowledge
the
nature
of
testimony
is
not
altered
nor
the
verification
of
causes
by
prescribed
methods
less
certain
again
the
truth
must
often
come
to
a
man
through
others
according
to
the
measure
of
his
capacity
and
education
but
neither
does
this
affect
the
testimony
whether
written
or
oral
which
he
knows
by
experience
to
be
trustworthy
he
can
not
escape
from
the
laws
of
his
own
mind
and
he
can
not
escape
from
the
further
accident
of
being
dependent
for
his
knowledge
on
others
but
still
this
is
no
reason
why
he
should
always
be
in
doubt
of
many
personal
of
many
historical
and
scientific
facts
he
may
be
absolutely
assured
and
having
such
a
mass
of
acknowledged
truth
in
the
mathematical
and
physical
not
to
speak
of
the
moral
sciences
the
moderns
have
certainly
no
reason
to
acquiesce
in
the
statement
that
truth
is
appearance
only
or
that
there
is
no
difference
between
appearance
and
truth
the
relativity
of
knowledge
is
a
truism
to
us
but
was
a
great
psychological
discovery
in
the
fifth
century
before
christ
of
this
discovery
the
first
distinct
assertion
is
contained
in
the
thesis
of
protagoras
probably
he
had
no
intention
either
of
denying
or
affirming
an
objective
standard
of
truth
he
did
not
consider
whether
man
in
the
higher
or
man
in
the
lower
sense
was
a
of
all
things
like
other
great
thinkers
he
was
absorbed
with
one
idea
and
that
idea
was
the
absoluteness
of
perception
like
socrates
he
seemed
to
see
that
philosophy
must
be
brought
back
from
to
from
the
world
to
man
but
he
did
not
stop
to
analyze
whether
he
meant
in
the
concrete
or
man
in
the
abstract
any
man
or
some
men
semper
quod
ubique
or
individual
private
judgment
such
an
analysis
lay
beyond
his
sphere
of
thought
the
age
before
socrates
had
not
arrived
at
these
distinctions
like
the
cynics
again
he
discarded
knowledge
in
any
higher
sense
than
perception
for
or
he
substituted
the
word
and
is
not
unwilling
to
admit
that
both
states
and
individuals
are
capable
of
practical
improvement
but
this
improvement
does
not
arise
from
intellectual
enlightenment
nor
yet
from
the
exertion
of
the
will
but
from
a
change
of
circumstances
and
impressions
and
he
who
can
effect
this
change
in
himself
or
others
may
be
deemed
a
philosopher
in
the
mode
of
effecting
it
while
agreeing
with
socrates
and
the
cynics
in
the
importance
which
he
attaches
to
practical
life
he
is
at
variance
with
both
of
them
to
suppose
that
practice
can
be
divorced
from
speculation
or
that
we
may
do
good
without
caring
about
truth
is
by
no
means
singular
either
in
philosophy
or
life
the
singularity
of
this
as
of
some
other
sophistical
doctrines
is
the
frankness
with
which
they
are
avowed
instead
of
being
veiled
as
in
modern
times
under
ambiguous
and
convenient
phrases
plato
appears
to
treat
protagoras
much
as
he
himself
is
treated
by
aristotle
that
is
to
say
he
does
not
attempt
to
understand
him
from
his
own
point
of
view
but
he
entangles
him
in
the
meshes
of
a
more
advanced
logic
to
which
protagoras
is
supposed
to
reply
by
megarian
quibbles
which
destroy
logic
only
man
but
each
man
and
each
man
at
each
moment
in
the
arguments
about
sight
and
memory
there
is
a
palpable
unfairness
which
is
worthy
of
the
great
brothers
euthydemus
and
dionysodorus
and
may
be
compared
with
the
egkekalummenos
of
eubulides
for
he
who
sees
with
one
eye
only
can
not
be
truly
said
both
to
see
and
not
to
see
nor
is
memory
which
is
liable
to
forget
the
immediate
knowledge
to
which
protagoras
applies
the
term
theodorus
justly
charges
socrates
with
going
beyond
the
truth
and
protagoras
has
equally
right
on
his
side
when
he
protests
against
socrates
arguing
from
the
common
use
of
words
which
vulgar
pervert
in
all
manner
of
ways
iii
the
theory
of
protagoras
is
connected
by
aristotle
as
well
as
plato
with
the
flux
of
heracleitus
but
aristotle
is
only
following
plato
and
plato
as
we
have
already
seen
did
not
mean
to
imply
that
such
a
connexion
was
admitted
by
protagoras
himself
his
metaphysical
genius
saw
or
seemed
to
see
a
common
tendency
in
them
just
as
the
modern
historian
of
ancient
philosophy
might
perceive
a
parallelism
between
two
thinkers
of
which
they
were
probably
unconscious
themselves
we
must
remember
throughout
that
plato
is
not
speaking
of
heracleitus
but
of
the
heracliteans
who
succeeded
him
nor
of
the
great
original
ideas
of
the
master
but
of
the
eristic
into
which
they
had
degenerated
a
hundred
years
later
there
is
nothing
in
the
fragments
of
heracleitus
which
at
all
justifies
plato
account
of
him
his
philosophy
may
be
resolved
into
two
elements
first
change
secondly
law
or
measure
pervading
the
change
these
he
saw
everywhere
and
often
expressed
in
strange
mythological
symbols
but
he
has
no
analysis
of
sensible
perception
such
as
plato
attributes
to
him
nor
is
there
any
reason
to
suppose
that
he
pushed
his
philosophy
into
that
absolute
negation
in
which
heracliteanism
was
sunk
in
the
age
of
plato
he
never
said
that
means
every
sort
of
change
and
he
expressly
distinguished
between
general
and
particular
understanding
like
a
poet
he
surveyed
the
elements
of
mythology
nature
thought
which
lay
before
him
and
sometimes
by
the
light
of
genius
he
saw
or
seemed
to
see
a
mysterious
principle
working
behind
them
but
as
has
been
the
case
with
other
great
philosophers
and
with
plato
and
aristotle
themselves
what
was
really
permanent
and
original
could
not
be
understood
by
the
next
generation
while
a
perverted
logic
carried
out
his
chance
expressions
with
an
illogical
consistency
his
simple
and
noble
thoughts
like
those
of
the
great
eleatic
soon
degenerated
into
a
mere
strife
of
words
and
when
thus
reduced
to
mere
words
they
seem
to
have
exercised
a
far
wider
influence
in
the
cities
of
ionia
where
the
people
mad
about
them
than
in
the
of
heracleitus
a
phenomenon
which
though
at
first
sight
singular
is
not
without
a
parallel
in
the
history
of
philosophy
and
theology
it
is
this
perverted
form
of
the
heraclitean
philosophy
which
is
supposed
to
effect
the
final
overthrow
of
protagorean
sensationalism
for
if
all
things
are
changing
at
every
moment
in
all
sorts
of
ways
then
there
is
nothing
fixed
or
defined
at
all
and
therefore
no
sensible
perception
nor
any
true
word
by
which
that
or
anything
else
can
be
described
of
course
protagoras
would
not
have
admitted
the
justice
of
this
argument
any
more
than
heracleitus
would
have
acknowledged
the
fanatics
who
appealed
to
his
writings
he
might
have
said
excellent
socrates
has
first
confused
me
with
heracleitus
and
heracleitus
with
his
ephesian
successors
and
has
then
disproved
the
existence
both
of
knowledge
and
sensation
but
i
am
not
responsible
for
what
i
never
said
nor
will
i
admit
that
my
account
of
knowledge
can
be
overthrown
by
unintelligible
heraclitean
paradoxes
iv
still
at
the
bottom
of
the
arguments
there
remains
a
truth
that
knowledge
is
something
more
than
sensible
perception
this
alone
would
not
distinguish
man
from
a
tadpole
the
absoluteness
of
sensations
at
each
moment
destroys
the
very
consciousness
of
sensations
compare
phileb
or
the
power
of
comparing
them
the
senses
are
not
mere
holes
in
a
horse
but
the
organs
of
a
presiding
nature
in
which
they
meet
a
great
advance
has
been
made
in
psychology
when
the
senses
are
recognized
as
organs
of
sense
and
we
are
admitted
to
see
or
feel
them
and
not
them
a
distinction
of
words
which
as
socrates
observes
is
by
no
means
pedantic
a
still
further
step
has
been
made
when
the
most
abstract
notions
such
as
being
and
sameness
and
difference
unity
and
plurality
are
acknowledged
to
be
the
creations
of
the
mind
herself
working
upon
the
feelings
or
impressions
of
sense
in
this
manner
plato
describes
the
process
of
acquiring
them
in
the
words
consists
not
in
the
feelings
or
affections
pathemasi
but
in
the
process
of
reasoning
about
them
sullogismo
here
is
in
the
parmenides
he
means
something
not
really
different
from
generalization
as
in
the
sophist
he
is
laying
the
foundation
of
a
rational
psychology
which
is
to
supersede
the
platonic
reminiscence
of
ideas
as
well
as
the
eleatic
being
and
the
individualism
of
megarians
and
cynics
having
rejected
the
doctrine
that
is
perception
we
now
proceed
to
look
for
a
definition
of
knowledge
in
the
sphere
of
opinion
but
here
we
are
met
by
a
singular
difficulty
how
is
false
opinion
possible
for
we
must
either
know
or
not
know
that
which
is
presented
to
the
mind
or
to
sense
we
of
course
should
answer
at
once
the
alternative
is
not
necessary
for
there
may
be
degrees
of
knowledge
and
we
may
know
and
have
forgotten
or
we
may
be
learning
or
we
may
have
a
general
but
not
a
particular
knowledge
or
we
may
know
but
not
be
able
to
explain
and
many
other
ways
may
be
imagined
in
which
we
know
and
do
not
know
at
the
same
time
but
these
answers
belong
to
a
later
stage
of
metaphysical
discussion
whereas
the
difficulty
in
question
naturally
arises
owing
to
the
childhood
of
the
human
mind
like
the
parallel
difficulty
respecting
men
had
only
recently
arrived
at
the
notion
of
opinion
they
could
not
at
once
define
the
true
and
pass
beyond
into
the
false
the
very
word
doxa
was
full
of
ambiguity
being
sometimes
as
in
the
eleatic
philosophy
applied
to
the
sensible
world
and
again
used
in
the
more
ordinary
sense
of
opinion
there
is
no
connexion
between
sensible
appearance
and
probability
and
yet
both
of
them
met
in
the
word
doxa
and
could
hardly
be
disengaged
from
one
another
in
the
mind
of
the
greek
living
in
the
fifth
or
fourth
century
to
this
was
often
added
as
at
the
end
of
the
fifth
book
of
the
republic
the
idea
of
relation
which
is
equally
distinct
from
either
of
them
also
a
fourth
notion
the
conclusion
of
the
dialectical
process
the
making
up
of
the
mind
after
she
has
been
to
we
are
not
then
surprised
that
the
sphere
of
opinion
and
of
should
be
a
dusky
place
republic
belonging
neither
to
the
old
world
of
sense
and
imagination
nor
to
the
new
world
of
reflection
and
reason
plato
attempts
to
clear
up
this
darkness
in
his
accustomed
manner
he
passes
from
the
lower
to
the
higher
without
omitting
the
intermediate
stages
this
appears
to
be
the
reason
why
he
seeks
for
the
definition
of
knowledge
first
in
the
sphere
of
opinion
hereafter
we
shall
find
that
something
more
than
opinion
is
required
false
opinion
is
explained
by
plato
at
first
as
a
confusion
of
mind
and
sense
which
arises
when
the
impression
on
the
mind
does
not
correspond
to
the
impression
made
on
the
senses
it
is
obvious
that
this
explanation
supposing
the
distinction
between
impressions
on
the
mind
and
impressions
on
the
senses
to
be
admitted
does
not
account
for
all
forms
of
error
and
plato
has
excluded
himself
from
the
consideration
of
the
greater
number
by
designedly
omitting
the
intermediate
processes
of
learning
and
forgetting
nor
does
he
include
fallacies
in
the
use
of
language
or
erroneous
inferences
but
he
is
struck
by
one
possibility
of
error
which
is
not
covered
by
his
theory
viz
errors
in
arithmetic
for
in
numbers
and
calculation
there
is
no
combination
of
thought
and
sense
and
yet
errors
may
often
happen
hence
he
is
led
to
discard
the
explanation
which
might
nevertheless
have
been
supposed
to
hold
good
for
anything
which
he
says
to
the
contrary
as
a
rationale
of
error
in
the
case
of
facts
derived
from
sense
another
attempt
is
made
to
explain
false
opinion
by
assigning
to
error
a
sort
of
positive
existence
but
error
or
ignorance
is
essentially
negative
a
if
we
knew
an
error
we
should
be
no
longer
in
error
we
may
veil
our
difficulty
under
figures
of
speech
but
these
although
telling
arguments
with
the
multitude
can
never
be
the
real
foundation
of
a
system
of
psychology
only
they
lead
us
to
dwell
upon
mental
phenomena
which
if
expressed
in
an
abstract
form
would
not
be
realized
by
us
at
all
the
figure
of
the
mind
receiving
impressions
is
one
of
those
images
which
have
rooted
themselves
for
ever
in
language
it
may
or
may
not
be
a
aid
to
thought
but
it
can
not
be
got
rid
of
the
other
figure
of
the
enclosure
is
also
remarkable
as
affording
the
first
hint
of
universal
ideas
a
notion
further
carried
out
in
the
sophist
this
is
implied
in
the
birds
some
in
flocks
some
solitary
which
fly
about
anywhere
and
everywhere
plato
discards
both
figures
as
not
really
solving
the
question
which
to
us
appears
so
simple
do
we
make
mistakes
the
failure
of
the
enquiry
seems
to
show
that
we
should
return
to
knowledge
and
begin
with
that
and
we
may
afterwards
proceed
with
a
better
hope
of
success
to
the
examination
of
opinion
but
is
true
opinion
really
distinct
from
knowledge
the
difference
between
these
he
seeks
to
establish
by
an
argument
which
to
us
appears
singular
and
unsatisfactory
the
existence
of
true
opinion
is
proved
by
the
rhetoric
of
the
law
courts
which
can
not
give
knowledge
but
may
give
true
opinion
the
rhetorician
can
not
put
the
judge
or
juror
in
possession
of
all
the
facts
which
prove
an
act
of
violence
but
he
may
truly
persuade
them
of
the
commission
of
such
an
act
here
the
idea
of
true
opinion
seems
to
be
a
right
conclusion
from
imperfect
knowledge
but
the
correctness
of
such
an
opinion
will
be
purely
accidental
and
is
really
the
effect
of
one
man
who
has
the
means
of
knowing
persuading
another
who
has
not
plato
would
have
done
better
if
he
had
said
that
true
opinion
was
a
contradiction
in
terms
assuming
the
distinction
between
knowledge
and
opinion
theaetetus
in
answer
to
socrates
proceeds
to
define
knowledge
as
true
opinion
with
definite
or
rational
explanation
this
socrates
identifies
with
another
and
different
theory
of
those
who
assert
that
knowledge
first
begins
with
a
proposition
the
elements
may
be
perceived
by
sense
but
they
are
names
and
can
not
be
defined
when
we
assign
to
them
some
predicate
they
first
begin
to
have
a
meaning
onomaton
sumploke
logou
ousia
this
seems
equivalent
to
saying
that
the
individuals
of
sense
become
the
subject
of
knowledge
when
they
are
regarded
as
they
are
in
nature
in
relation
to
other
individuals
yet
we
feel
a
difficulty
in
following
this
new
hypothesis
for
must
not
opinion
be
equally
expressed
in
a
proposition
the
difference
between
true
and
false
opinion
is
not
the
difference
between
the
particular
and
the
universal
but
between
the
true
universal
and
the
false
thought
may
be
as
much
at
fault
as
sight
when
we
place
individuals
under
a
class
or
assign
to
them
attributes
this
is
not
knowledge
but
a
very
rudimentary
process
of
thought
the
first
generalization
of
all
without
which
language
would
be
impossible
and
has
plato
kept
altogether
clear
of
a
confusion
which
the
analogous
word
logos
tends
to
create
of
a
proposition
and
a
definition
and
is
not
the
confusion
increased
by
the
use
of
the
analogous
term
or
for
there
is
no
real
resemblance
between
the
relation
of
letters
to
a
syllable
and
of
the
terms
to
a
proposition
plato
in
the
spirit
of
the
megarian
philosophy
soon
discovers
a
flaw
in
the
explanation
for
how
can
we
know
a
compound
of
which
the
simple
elements
are
unknown
to
us
can
two
unknowns
make
a
known
can
a
whole
be
something
different
from
the
parts
the
answer
of
experience
is
that
they
can
for
we
may
know
a
compound
which
we
are
unable
to
analyze
into
its
elements
and
all
the
parts
when
united
may
be
more
than
all
the
parts
separated
the
number
four
or
any
other
number
is
more
than
the
units
which
are
contained
in
it
any
chemical
compound
is
more
than
and
different
from
the
simple
elements
but
ancient
philosophy
in
this
as
in
many
other
instances
proceeding
by
the
path
of
mental
analysis
was
perplexed
by
doubts
which
warred
against
the
plainest
facts
three
attempts
to
explain
the
new
definition
of
knowledge
still
remain
to
be
considered
they
all
of
them
turn
on
the
explanation
of
logos
the
first
account
of
the
meaning
of
the
word
is
the
reflection
of
thought
in
speech
a
sort
of
nominalism
science
est
une
langue
bien
faite
but
anybody
who
is
not
dumb
can
say
what
he
thinks
therefore
mere
speech
can
not
be
knowledge
and
yet
we
may
observe
that
there
is
in
this
explanation
an
element
of
truth
which
is
not
recognized
by
plato
viz
that
truth
and
thought
are
inseparable
from
language
although
mere
expression
in
words
is
not
truth
the
second
explanation
of
logos
is
the
enumeration
of
the
elementary
parts
of
the
complex
whole
but
this
is
only
definition
accompanied
with
right
opinion
and
does
not
yet
attain
to
the
certainty
of
knowledge
plato
does
not
mention
the
greater
objection
which
is
that
the
enumeration
of
particulars
is
endless
such
a
definition
would
be
based
on
no
principle
and
would
not
help
us
at
all
in
gaining
a
common
idea
the
third
is
the
best
explanation
the
possession
of
a
characteristic
mark
which
seems
to
answer
to
the
logical
definition
by
genus
and
difference
but
this
again
is
equally
necessary
for
right
opinion
and
we
have
already
determined
although
not
on
very
satisfactory
grounds
that
knowledge
must
be
distinguished
from
opinion
a
better
distinction
is
drawn
between
them
in
the
timaeus
they
might
be
opposed
as
philosophy
and
rhetoric
and
as
conversant
respectively
with
necessary
and
contingent
matter
but
no
true
idea
of
the
nature
of
either
of
them
or
of
their
relation
to
one
another
could
be
framed
until
science
obtained
a
content
the
ancient
philosophers
in
the
age
of
plato
thought
of
science
only
as
pure
abstraction
and
to
this
opinion
stood
in
no
relation
like
theaetetus
we
have
attained
to
no
definite
result
but
an
interesting
phase
of
ancient
philosophy
has
passed
before
us
and
the
negative
result
is
not
to
be
despised
for
on
certain
subjects
and
in
certain
states
of
knowledge
the
work
of
negation
or
clearing
the
ground
must
go
on
perhaps
for
a
generation
before
the
new
structure
can
begin
to
rise
plato
saw
the
necessity
of
combating
the
illogical
logic
of
the
megarians
and
eristics
for
the
completion
of
the
edifice
he
makes
preparation
in
the
theaetetus
and
crowns
the
work
in
the
sophist
many
fine
expressions
and
remarks
full
of
wisdom
also
germs
of
a
metaphysic
of
the
future
are
scattered
up
and
down
in
the
dialogue
such
for
example
as
the
comparison
of
progress
in
learning
to
the
flow
of
a
river
of
oil
the
satirical
touch
a
sauce
or
fawning
speech
or
the
remarkable
expression
of
impure
dialectic
or
the
lively
images
under
which
the
argument
is
described
flood
of
arguments
pouring
in
the
fresh
discussions
in
like
a
band
of
revellers
as
illustrations
of
the
second
head
may
be
cited
the
remark
of
socrates
that
of
words
although
sometimes
pedantic
are
also
necessary
or
the
fine
touch
in
the
character
of
the
lawyer
that
came
upon
him
when
the
tenderness
of
youth
was
unequal
to
them
or
the
description
of
the
manner
in
which
the
spirit
is
broken
in
a
wicked
man
who
listens
to
reproof
until
he
becomes
like
a
child
or
the
punishment
of
the
wicked
which
is
not
physical
suffering
but
the
perpetual
companionship
of
evil
compare
gorgias
or
the
saying
often
repeated
by
aristotle
and
others
that
begins
in
wonder
for
iris
is
the
child
of
thaumas
or
the
superb
contempt
with
which
the
philosopher
takes
down
the
pride
of
wealthy
landed
proprietors
by
comparison
of
the
whole
earth
important
metaphysical
ideas
are
the
conception
of
thought
as
the
mind
talking
to
herself
the
notion
of
a
common
sense
developed
further
by
aristotle
and
the
explicit
declaration
that
the
mind
gains
her
conceptions
of
being
sameness
number
and
the
like
from
reflection
on
herself
the
excellent
distinction
of
theaetetus
which
socrates
speaking
with
emphasis
to
grow
between
seeing
the
forms
or
hearing
the
sounds
of
words
in
a
foreign
language
and
understanding
the
meaning
of
them
and
the
distinction
of
socrates
himself
between
and
knowledge
in
which
the
answer
to
the
whole
discussion
appears
to
be
contained
there
is
a
difference
between
ancient
and
modern
psychology
and
we
have
a
difficulty
in
explaining
one
in
the
terms
of
the
other
to
us
the
inward
and
outward
sense
and
the
inward
and
outward
worlds
of
which
they
are
the
organs
are
parted
by
a
wall
and
appear
as
if
they
could
never
be
confounded
the
mind
is
endued
with
faculties
habits
instincts
and
a
personality
or
consciousness
in
which
they
are
bound
together
over
against
these
are
placed
forms
colours
external
bodies
coming
into
contact
with
our
own
body
we
speak
of
a
subject
which
is
ourselves
of
an
object
which
is
all
the
rest
these
are
separable
in
thought
but
united
in
any
act
of
sensation
reflection
or
volition
as
there
are
various
degrees
in
which
the
mind
may
enter
into
or
be
abstracted
from
the
operations
of
sense
so
there
are
various
points
at
which
this
separation
or
union
may
be
supposed
to
occur
and
within
the
sphere
of
mind
the
analogy
of
sense
reappears
and
we
distinguish
not
only
external
objects
but
objects
of
will
and
of
knowledge
which
we
contrast
with
them
these
again
are
comprehended
in
a
higher
object
which
reunites
with
the
subject
a
multitude
of
abstractions
are
created
by
the
efforts
of
successive
thinkers
which
become
logical
determinations
and
they
have
to
be
arranged
in
order
before
the
scheme
of
thought
is
complete
the
framework
of
the
human
intellect
is
not
the
peculium
of
an
individual
but
the
joint
work
of
many
who
are
of
all
ages
and
countries
what
we
are
in
mind
is
due
not
merely
to
our
physical
but
to
our
mental
antecedents
which
we
trace
in
history
and
more
especially
in
the
history
of
philosophy
nor
can
mental
phenomena
be
truly
explained
either
by
physiology
or
by
the
observation
of
consciousness
apart
from
their
history
they
have
a
growth
of
their
own
like
the
growth
of
a
flower
a
tree
a
human
being
they
may
be
conceived
as
of
themselves
constituting
a
common
mind
and
having
a
sort
of
personal
identity
in
which
they
coexist
so
comprehensive
is
modern
psychology
seeming
to
aim
at
constructing
anew
the
entire
world
of
thought
and
prior
to
or
simultaneously
with
this
construction
a
negative
process
has
to
be
carried
on
a
clearing
away
of
useless
abstractions
which
we
have
inherited
from
the
past
many
erroneous
conceptions
of
the
mind
derived
from
former
philosophies
have
found
their
way
into
language
and
we
with
difficulty
disengage
ourselves
from
them
mere
figures
of
speech
have
unconsciously
influenced
the
minds
of
great
thinkers
also
there
are
some
distinctions
as
for
example
that
of
the
will
and
of
the
reason
and
of
the
moral
and
intellectual
faculties
which
are
carried
further
than
is
justified
by
experience
any
separation
of
things
which
we
can
not
see
or
exactly
define
though
it
may
be
necessary
is
a
fertile
source
of
error
the
division
of
the
mind
into
faculties
or
powers
or
virtues
is
too
deeply
rooted
in
language
to
be
got
rid
of
but
it
gives
a
false
impression
for
if
we
reflect
on
ourselves
we
see
that
all
our
faculties
easily
pass
into
one
another
and
are
bound
together
in
a
single
mind
or
consciousness
but
this
mental
unity
is
apt
to
be
concealed
from
us
by
the
distinctions
of
language
a
profusion
of
words
and
ideas
has
obscured
rather
than
enlightened
mental
science
it
is
hard
to
say
how
many
fallacies
have
arisen
from
the
representation
of
the
mind
as
a
box
as
a
rasa
a
book
a
mirror
and
the
like
it
is
remarkable
how
plato
in
the
theaetetus
after
having
indulged
in
the
figure
of
the
waxen
tablet
and
the
decoy
afterwards
discards
them
the
mind
is
also
represented
by
another
class
of
images
as
the
spring
of
a
watch
a
motive
power
a
breath
a
stream
a
succession
of
points
or
moments
as
plato
remarks
in
the
cratylus
words
expressive
of
motion
as
well
as
of
rest
are
employed
to
describe
the
faculties
and
operations
of
the
mind
and
in
these
there
is
contained
another
store
of
fallacies
some
shadow
or
reflection
of
the
body
seems
always
to
adhere
to
our
thoughts
about
ourselves
and
mental
processes
are
hardly
distinguished
in
language
from
bodily
ones
to
see
or
perceive
are
used
indifferently
of
both
the
words
intuition
moral
sense
common
sense
the
mind
eye
are
figures
of
speech
transferred
from
one
to
the
other
and
many
other
words
used
in
early
poetry
or
in
sacred
writings
to
express
the
works
of
mind
have
a
materialistic
sound
for
old
mythology
was
allied
to
sense
and
the
distinction
of
matter
and
mind
had
not
as
yet
arisen
thus
materialism
receives
an
illusive
aid
from
language
and
both
in
philosophy
and
religion
the
imaginary
figure
or
association
easily
takes
the
place
of
real
knowledge
again
there
is
the
illusion
of
looking
into
our
own
minds
as
if
our
thoughts
or
feelings
were
written
down
in
a
book
this
is
another
figure
of
speech
which
might
be
appropriately
termed
fallacy
of
the
we
can
not
look
at
the
mind
unless
we
have
the
eye
which
sees
and
we
can
only
look
not
into
but
out
of
the
mind
at
the
thoughts
words
actions
of
ourselves
and
others
what
we
dimly
recognize
within
us
is
not
experience
but
rather
the
suggestion
of
an
experience
which
we
may
gather
if
we
will
from
the
observation
of
the
world
the
memory
has
but
a
feeble
recollection
of
what
we
were
saying
or
doing
a
few
weeks
or
a
few
months
ago
and
still
less
of
what
we
were
thinking
or
feeling
this
is
one
among
many
reasons
why
there
is
so
little
among
mankind
they
do
not
carry
with
them
the
thought
of
what
they
are
or
have
been
the
of
consciousness
are
equally
evanescent
they
are
facts
which
nobody
ever
saw
and
which
can
neither
be
defined
nor
described
of
the
three
laws
of
thought
the
first
all
a
a
is
an
identical
proposition
that
is
to
say
a
mere
word
or
symbol
claiming
to
be
a
proposition
the
two
others
nothing
can
be
a
and
not
a
and
everything
is
either
a
or
not
a
are
untrue
because
they
exclude
degrees
and
also
the
mixed
modes
and
double
aspects
under
which
truth
is
so
often
presented
to
us
to
assert
that
man
is
man
is
unmeaning
to
say
that
he
is
free
or
necessary
and
can
not
be
both
is
a
half
truth
only
these
are
a
few
of
the
entanglements
which
impede
the
natural
course
of
human
thought
lastly
there
is
the
fallacy
which
lies
still
deeper
of
regarding
the
individual
mind
apart
from
the
universal
or
either
as
a
entity
apart
from
the
ideas
which
are
contained
in
them
in
ancient
philosophies
the
analysis
of
the
mind
is
still
rudimentary
and
imperfect
it
naturally
began
with
an
effort
to
disengage
the
universal
from
sense
this
was
the
first
lifting
up
of
the
mist
it
wavered
between
object
and
subject
passing
imperceptibly
from
one
or
being
to
mind
and
thought
appearance
in
the
outward
object
was
for
a
time
indistinguishable
from
opinion
in
the
subject
at
length
mankind
spoke
of
knowing
as
well
as
of
opining
or
perceiving
but
when
the
word
was
found
how
was
it
to
be
explained
or
defined
it
was
not
an
error
it
was
a
step
in
the
right
direction
when
protagoras
said
that
is
the
measure
of
all
things
and
that
knowledge
is
perception
this
was
the
subjective
which
corresponded
to
the
objective
is
flux
but
the
thoughts
of
men
deepened
and
soon
they
began
to
be
aware
that
knowledge
was
neither
sense
nor
yet
opinion
with
or
without
explanation
nor
the
expression
of
thought
nor
the
enumeration
of
parts
nor
the
addition
of
characteristic
marks
motion
and
rest
were
equally
ill
adapted
to
express
its
nature
although
both
must
in
some
sense
be
attributed
to
it
it
might
be
described
more
truly
as
the
mind
conversing
with
herself
the
discourse
of
reason
the
hymn
of
dialectic
the
science
of
relations
of
ideas
of
the
arts
and
sciences
of
the
one
of
the
good
of
the
all
this
is
the
way
along
which
plato
is
leading
us
in
his
later
dialogues
in
its
higher
signification
it
was
the
knowledge
not
of
men
but
of
gods
perfect
and
all
sufficing
like
other
ideals
always
passing
out
of
sight
and
nevertheless
present
to
the
mind
of
aristotle
as
well
as
plato
and
the
reality
to
which
they
were
both
tending
for
aristotle
as
well
as
plato
would
in
modern
phraseology
have
been
termed
a
mystic
and
like
him
would
have
defined
the
higher
philosophy
to
be
of
being
or
essence
words
to
which
in
our
own
day
we
have
a
difficulty
in
attaching
a
meaning
yet
in
spite
of
plato
and
his
followers
mankind
have
again
and
again
returned
to
a
sensational
philosophy
as
to
some
of
the
early
thinkers
amid
the
fleetings
of
sensible
objects
ideas
alone
seemed
to
be
fixed
so
to
a
later
generation
amid
the
fluctuation
of
philosophical
opinions
the
only
fixed
points
appeared
to
be
outward
objects
any
pretence
of
knowledge
which
went
beyond
them
implied
logical
processes
of
the
correctness
of
which
they
had
no
assurance
and
which
at
best
were
only
probable
the
mind
tired
of
wandering
sought
to
rest
on
firm
ground
when
the
idols
of
philosophy
and
language
were
stripped
off
the
perception
of
outward
objects
alone
remained
the
ancient
epicureans
never
asked
whether
the
comparison
of
these
with
one
another
did
not
involve
principles
of
another
kind
which
were
above
and
beyond
them
in
like
manner
the
modern
inductive
philosophy
forgot
to
enquire
into
the
meaning
of
experience
and
did
not
attempt
to
form
a
conception
of
outward
objects
apart
from
the
mind
or
of
the
mind
apart
from
them
soon
objects
of
sense
were
merged
in
sensations
and
feelings
but
feelings
and
sensations
were
still
unanalyzed
at
last
we
return
to
the
doctrine
attributed
by
plato
to
protagoras
that
the
mind
is
only
a
succession
of
momentary
perceptions
at
this
point
the
modern
philosophy
of
experience
forms
an
alliance
with
ancient
scepticism
the
higher
truths
of
philosophy
and
religion
are
very
far
removed
from
sense
admitting
that
like
all
other
knowledge
they
are
derived
from
experience
and
that
experience
is
ultimately
resolvable
into
facts
which
come
to
us
through
the
eye
and
ear
still
their
origin
is
a
mere
accident
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
their
true
nature
they
are
universal
and
unseen
they
belong
to
all
times
past
present
and
future
any
worthy
notion
of
mind
or
reason
includes
them
the
proof
of
them
is
their
comprehensiveness
and
consistency
with
one
another
their
agreement
with
history
and
experience
but
sensation
is
of
the
present
only
is
isolated
is
and
is
not
in
successive
moments
it
takes
the
passing
hour
as
it
comes
following
the
lead
of
the
eye
or
ear
instead
of
the
command
of
reason
it
is
a
faculty
which
man
has
in
common
with
the
animals
and
in
which
he
is
inferior
to
many
of
them
the
importance
of
the
senses
in
us
is
that
they
are
the
apertures
of
the
mind
doors
and
windows
through
which
we
take
in
and
make
our
own
the
materials
of
knowledge
regarded
in
any
other
point
of
view
sensation
is
of
all
mental
acts
the
most
trivial
and
superficial
hence
the
term
is
rightly
used
to
express
what
is
shallow
in
thought
and
feeling
we
propose
in
what
follows
first
of
all
like
plato
in
the
theaetetus
to
analyse
sensation
and
secondly
to
trace
the
connexion
between
theories
of
sensation
and
a
sensational
or
epicurean
philosophy
paragraph
i
we
as
well
as
the
ancients
speak
of
the
five
senses
and
of
a
sense
or
common
sense
which
is
the
abstraction
of
them
the
term
is
also
used
metaphorically
both
in
ancient
and
modern
philosophy
to
express
the
operations
of
the
mind
which
are
immediate
or
intuitive
of
the
five
senses
two
the
sight
and
the
hearing
are
of
a
more
subtle
and
complex
nature
while
two
others
the
smell
and
the
taste
seem
to
be
only
more
refined
varieties
of
touch
all
of
them
are
passive
and
by
this
are
distinguished
from
the
active
faculty
of
speech
they
receive
impressions
but
do
not
produce
them
except
in
so
far
as
they
are
objects
of
sense
themselves
physiology
speaks
to
us
of
the
wonderful
apparatus
of
nerves
muscles
tissues
by
which
the
senses
are
enabled
to
fulfil
their
functions
it
traces
the
connexion
though
imperfectly
of
the
bodily
organs
with
the
operations
of
the
mind
of
these
latter
it
seems
rather
to
know
the
conditions
than
the
causes
it
can
prove
to
us
that
without
the
brain
we
can
not
think
and
that
without
the
eye
we
can
not
see
and
yet
there
is
far
more
in
thinking
and
seeing
than
is
given
by
the
brain
and
the
eye
it
observes
the
variations
of
body
and
mind
psychology
on
the
other
hand
treats
of
the
same
subject
regarded
from
another
point
of
view
it
speaks
of
the
relation
of
the
senses
to
one
another
it
shows
how
they
meet
the
mind
it
analyzes
the
transition
from
sense
to
thought
the
one
describes
their
nature
as
apparent
to
the
outward
eye
by
the
other
they
are
regarded
only
as
the
instruments
of
the
mind
it
is
in
this
latter
point
of
view
that
we
propose
to
consider
them
the
simplest
sensation
involves
an
unconscious
or
nascent
operation
of
the
mind
it
implies
objects
of
sense
and
objects
of
sense
have
differences
of
form
number
colour
but
the
conception
of
an
object
without
us
or
the
power
of
discriminating
numbers
forms
colours
is
not
given
by
the
sense
but
by
the
mind
a
mere
sensation
does
not
attain
to
distinctness
it
is
a
confused
impression
sugkechumenon
ti
as
plato
says
republic
until
number
introduces
light
and
order
into
the
confusion
at
what
point
confusion
becomes
distinctness
is
a
question
of
degree
which
can
not
be
precisely
determined
the
distant
object
the
undefined
notion
come
out
into
relief
as
we
approach
them
or
attend
to
them
or
we
may
assist
the
analysis
by
attempting
to
imagine
the
world
first
dawning
upon
the
eye
of
the
infant
or
of
a
person
newly
restored
to
sight
yet
even
with
them
the
mind
as
well
as
the
eye
opens
or
enlarges
for
all
three
are
inseparably
bound
together
the
object
would
be
nowhere
and
nothing
if
not
perceived
by
the
sense
and
the
sense
would
have
no
power
of
distinguishing
without
the
mind
but
prior
to
objects
of
sense
there
is
a
third
nature
in
which
they
are
contained
that
is
to
say
space
which
may
be
explained
in
various
ways
it
is
the
element
which
surrounds
them
it
is
the
vacuum
or
void
which
they
leave
or
occupy
when
passing
from
one
portion
of
space
to
another
it
might
be
described
in
the
language
of
ancient
philosophy
as
of
objects
it
is
a
negative
idea
which
in
the
course
of
ages
has
become
positive
it
is
originally
derived
from
the
contemplation
of
the
world
without
us
the
boundless
earth
or
sea
the
vacant
heaven
and
is
therefore
acquired
chiefly
through
the
sense
of
sight
to
the
blind
the
conception
of
space
is
feeble
and
inadequate
derived
for
the
most
part
from
touch
or
from
the
descriptions
of
others
at
first
it
appears
to
be
continuous
afterwards
we
perceive
it
to
be
capable
of
division
by
lines
or
points
real
or
imaginary
by
the
help
of
mathematics
we
form
another
idea
of
space
which
is
altogether
independent
of
experience
geometry
teaches
us
that
the
innumerable
lines
and
figures
by
which
space
is
or
may
be
intersected
are
absolutely
true
in
all
their
combinations
and
consequences
new
and
unchangeable
properties
of
space
are
thus
developed
which
are
proved
to
us
in
a
thousand
ways
by
mathematical
reasoning
as
well
as
by
common
experience
through
quantity
and
measure
we
are
conducted
to
our
simplest
and
purest
notion
of
matter
which
is
to
the
cube
or
solid
what
space
is
to
the
square
or
surface
and
all
our
applications
of
mathematics
are
applications
of
our
ideas
of
space
to
matter
no
wonder
then
that
they
seem
to
have
a
necessary
existence
to
us
being
the
simplest
of
our
ideas
space
is
also
the
one
of
which
we
have
the
most
difficulty
in
ridding
ourselves
neither
can
we
set
a
limit
to
it
for
wherever
we
fix
a
limit
space
is
springing
up
beyond
neither
can
we
conceive
a
smallest
or
indivisible
portion
of
it
for
within
the
smallest
there
is
a
smaller
still
and
even
these
inconceivable
qualities
of
space
whether
the
infinite
or
the
infinitesimal
may
be
made
the
subject
of
reasoning
and
have
a
certain
truth
to
us
whether
space
exists
in
the
mind
or
out
of
it
is
a
question
which
has
no
meaning
we
should
rather
say
that
without
it
the
mind
is
incapable
of
conceiving
the
body
and
therefore
of
conceiving
itself
the
mind
may
be
indeed
imagined
to
contain
the
body
in
the
same
way
that
aristotle
partly
following
plato
supposes
god
to
be
the
outer
heaven
or
circle
of
the
universe
but
how
can
the
individual
mind
carry
about
the
universe
of
space
packed
up
within
or
how
can
separate
minds
have
either
a
universe
of
their
own
or
a
common
universe
in
such
conceptions
there
seems
to
be
a
confusion
of
the
individual
and
the
universal
to
say
that
we
can
only
have
a
true
idea
of
ourselves
when
we
deny
the
reality
of
that
by
which
we
have
any
idea
of
ourselves
is
an
absurdity
the
earth
which
is
our
habitation
and
starry
heaven
above
and
we
ourselves
are
equally
an
illusion
if
space
is
only
a
quality
or
condition
of
our
minds
again
we
may
compare
the
truths
of
space
with
other
truths
derived
from
experience
which
seem
to
have
a
necessity
to
us
in
proportion
to
the
frequency
of
their
recurrence
or
the
truth
of
the
consequences
which
may
be
inferred
from
them
we
are
thus
led
to
remark
that
the
necessity
in
our
ideas
of
space
on
which
much
stress
has
been
laid
differs
in
a
slight
degree
only
from
the
necessity
which
appears
to
belong
to
other
of
our
ideas
weight
motion
and
the
like
and
there
is
another
way
in
which
this
necessity
may
be
explained
we
have
been
taught
it
and
the
truth
which
we
were
taught
or
which
we
inherited
has
never
been
contradicted
in
all
our
experience
and
is
therefore
confirmed
by
it
who
can
resist
an
idea
which
is
presented
to
him
in
a
general
form
in
every
moment
of
his
life
and
of
which
he
finds
no
instance
to
the
contrary
the
greater
part
of
what
is
sometimes
regarded
as
the
a
priori
intuition
of
space
is
really
the
conception
of
the
various
geometrical
figures
of
which
the
properties
have
been
revealed
by
mathematical
analysis
and
the
certainty
of
these
properties
is
immeasurably
increased
to
us
by
our
finding
that
they
hold
good
not
only
in
every
instance
but
in
all
the
consequences
which
are
supposed
to
flow
from
them
neither
must
we
forget
that
our
idea
of
space
like
our
other
ideas
has
a
history
the
homeric
poems
contain
no
word
for
it
even
the
later
greek
philosophy
has
not
the
kantian
notion
of
space
but
only
the
definite
or
infinite
to
plato
in
the
timaeus
it
is
known
only
as
the
of
generation
when
therefore
we
speak
of
the
necessity
of
our
ideas
of
space
we
must
remember
that
this
is
a
necessity
which
has
grown
up
with
the
growth
of
the
human
mind
and
has
been
made
by
ourselves
we
can
free
ourselves
from
the
perplexities
which
are
involved
in
it
by
ascending
to
a
time
in
which
they
did
not
as
yet
exist
and
when
space
or
time
are
described
as
priori
forms
or
intuitions
added
to
the
matter
given
in
sensation
we
should
consider
that
such
expressions
belong
really
to
the
study
of
philosophy
to
the
eighteenth
century
when
men
sought
to
explain
the
human
mind
without
regard
to
history
or
language
or
the
social
nature
of
man
in
every
act
of
sense
there
is
a
latent
perception
of
space
of
which
we
only
become
conscious
when
objects
are
withdrawn
from
it
there
are
various
ways
in
which
we
may
trace
the
connexion
between
them
we
may
think
of
space
as
unresisting
matter
and
of
matter
as
divided
into
objects
or
of
objects
again
as
formed
by
abstraction
into
a
collective
notion
of
matter
and
of
matter
as
rarefied
into
space
and
motion
may
be
conceived
as
the
union
of
there
and
not
there
in
space
and
force
as
the
materializing
or
solidification
of
motion
space
again
is
the
individual
and
universal
in
one
or
in
other
words
a
perception
and
also
a
conception
so
easily
do
what
are
sometimes
called
our
simple
ideas
pass
into
one
another
and
differences
of
kind
resolve
themselves
into
differences
of
degree
within
or
behind
space
there
is
another
abstraction
in
many
respects
similar
to
it
time
the
form
of
the
inward
as
space
is
the
form
of
the
outward
as
we
can
not
think
of
outward
objects
of
sense
or
of
outward
sensations
without
space
so
neither
can
we
think
of
a
succession
of
sensations
without
time
it
is
the
vacancy
of
thoughts
or
sensations
as
space
is
the
void
of
outward
objects
and
we
can
no
more
imagine
the
mind
without
the
one
than
the
world
without
the
other
it
is
to
arithmetic
what
space
is
to
geometry
or
more
strictly
arithmetic
may
be
said
to
be
equally
applicable
to
both
it
is
defined
in
our
minds
partly
by
the
analogy
of
space
and
partly
by
the
recollection
of
events
which
have
happened
to
us
or
the
consciousness
of
feelings
which
we
are
experiencing
like
space
it
is
without
limit
for
whatever
beginning
or
end
of
time
we
fix
there
is
a
beginning
and
end
before
them
and
so
on
without
end
we
speak
of
a
past
present
and
future
and
again
the
analogy
of
space
assists
us
in
conceiving
of
them
as
coexistent
when
the
limit
of
time
is
removed
there
arises
in
our
minds
the
idea
of
eternity
which
at
first
like
time
itself
is
only
negative
but
gradually
when
connected
with
the
world
and
the
divine
nature
like
the
other
negative
infinity
of
space
becomes
positive
whether
time
is
prior
to
the
mind
and
to
experience
or
coeval
with
them
is
like
the
parallel
question
about
space
unmeaning
like
space
it
has
been
realized
gradually
in
the
homeric
poems
or
even
in
the
hesiodic
cosmogony
there
is
no
more
notion
of
time
than
of
space
the
conception
of
being
is
more
general
than
either
and
might
therefore
with
greater
plausibility
be
affirmed
to
be
a
condition
or
quality
of
the
mind
the
a
priori
intuitions
of
kant
would
have
been
as
unintelligible
to
plato
as
his
a
priori
synthetical
propositions
to
aristotle
the
philosopher
of
konigsberg
supposed
himself
to
be
analyzing
a
necessary
mode
of
thought
he
was
not
aware
that
he
was
dealing
with
a
mere
abstraction
but
now
that
we
are
able
to
trace
the
gradual
developement
of
ideas
through
religion
through
language
through
abstractions
why
should
we
interpose
the
fiction
of
time
between
ourselves
and
realities
why
should
we
single
out
one
of
these
abstractions
to
be
the
a
priori
condition
of
all
the
others
it
comes
last
and
not
first
in
the
order
of
our
thoughts
and
is
not
the
condition
precedent
of
them
but
the
last
generalization
of
them
nor
can
any
principle
be
imagined
more
suicidal
to
philosophy
than
to
assume
that
all
the
truth
which
we
are
capable
of
attaining
is
seen
only
through
an
unreal
medium
if
all
that
exists
in
time
is
illusion
we
may
well
ask
with
plato
becomes
of
the
mind
leaving
the
a
priori
conditions
of
sensation
we
may
proceed
to
consider
acts
of
sense
these
admit
of
various
degrees
of
duration
or
intensity
they
admit
also
of
a
greater
or
less
extension
from
one
object
which
is
perceived
directly
to
many
which
are
perceived
indirectly
or
in
a
less
degree
and
to
the
various
associations
of
the
object
which
are
latent
in
the
mind
in
general
the
greater
the
intension
the
less
the
extension
of
them
the
simplest
sensation
implies
some
relation
of
objects
to
one
another
some
position
in
space
some
relation
to
a
previous
or
subsequent
sensation
the
acts
of
seeing
and
hearing
may
be
almost
unconscious
and
may
pass
away
unnoted
they
may
also
leave
an
impression
behind
them
or
power
of
recalling
them
if
after
seeing
an
object
we
shut
our
eyes
the
object
remains
dimly
seen
in
the
same
or
about
the
same
place
but
with
form
and
lineaments
half
filled
up
this
is
the
simplest
act
of
memory
and
as
we
can
not
see
one
thing
without
at
the
same
time
seeing
another
different
objects
hang
together
in
recollection
and
when
we
call
for
one
the
other
quickly
follows
to
think
of
the
place
in
which
we
have
last
seen
a
thing
is
often
the
best
way
of
recalling
it
to
the
mind
hence
memory
is
dependent
on
association
the
act
of
recollection
may
be
compared
to
the
sight
of
an
object
at
a
great
distance
which
we
have
previously
seen
near
and
seek
to
bring
near
to
us
in
thought
memory
is
to
sense
as
dreaming
is
to
waking
and
like
dreaming
has
a
wayward
and
uncertain
power
of
recalling
impressions
from
the
past
thus
begins
the
passage
from
the
outward
to
the
inward
sense
but
as
yet
there
is
no
conception
of
a
universal
the
mind
only
remembers
the
individual
object
or
objects
and
is
always
attaching
to
them
some
colour
or
association
of
sense
the
power
of
recollection
seems
to
depend
on
the
intensity
or
largeness
of
the
perception
or
on
the
strength
of
some
emotion
with
which
it
is
inseparably
connected
this
is
the
natural
memory
which
is
allied
to
sense
such
as
children
appear
to
have
and
barbarians
and
animals
it
is
necessarily
limited
in
range
and
its
limitation
is
its
strength
in
later
life
when
the
mind
has
become
crowded
with
names
acts
feelings
images
innumerable
we
acquire
by
education
another
memory
of
system
and
arrangement
which
is
both
stronger
and
weaker
than
the
first
weaker
in
the
recollection
of
sensible
impressions
as
they
are
represented
to
us
by
eye
or
ear
stronger
by
the
natural
connexion
of
ideas
with
objects
or
with
one
another
and
many
of
the
notions
which
form
a
part
of
the
train
of
our
thoughts
are
hardly
realized
by
us
at
the
time
but
like
numbers
or
algebraical
symbols
are
used
as
signs
only
thus
lightening
the
labour
of
recollection
and
now
we
may
suppose
that
numerous
images
present
themselves
to
the
mind
which
begins
to
act
upon
them
and
to
arrange
them
in
various
ways
besides
the
impression
of
external
objects
present
with
us
or
just
absent
from
us
we
have
a
dimmer
conception
of
other
objects
which
have
disappeared
from
our
immediate
recollection
and
yet
continue
to
exist
in
us
the
mind
is
full
of
fancies
which
are
passing
to
and
fro
before
it
some
feeling
or
association
calls
them
up
and
they
are
uttered
by
the
lips
this
is
the
first
rudimentary
imagination
which
may
be
truly
described
in
the
language
of
hobbes
as
sense
an
expression
which
may
be
applied
with
equal
truth
to
memory
as
well
for
memory
and
imagination
though
we
sometimes
oppose
them
are
nearly
allied
the
difference
between
them
seems
chiefly
to
lie
in
the
activity
of
the
one
compared
with
the
passivity
of
the
other
the
sense
decaying
in
memory
receives
a
flash
of
light
or
life
from
imagination
dreaming
is
a
link
of
connexion
between
them
for
in
dreaming
we
feebly
recollect
and
also
feebly
imagine
at
one
and
the
same
time
when
reason
is
asleep
the
lower
part
of
the
mind
wanders
at
will
amid
the
images
which
have
been
received
from
without
the
intelligent
element
retires
and
the
sensual
or
sensuous
takes
its
place
and
so
in
the
first
efforts
of
imagination
reason
is
latent
or
set
aside
and
images
in
part
disorderly
but
also
having
a
unity
however
imperfect
of
their
own
pour
like
a
flood
over
the
mind
and
if
we
could
penetrate
into
the
heads
of
animals
we
should
probably
find
that
their
intelligence
or
the
state
of
what
in
them
is
analogous
to
our
intelligence
is
of
this
nature
thus
far
we
have
been
speaking
of
men
rather
in
the
points
in
which
they
resemble
animals
than
in
the
points
in
which
they
differ
from
them
the
animal
too
has
memory
in
various
degrees
and
the
elements
of
imagination
if
as
appears
to
be
the
case
he
dreams
how
far
their
powers
or
instincts
are
educated
by
the
circumstances
of
their
lives
or
by
intercourse
with
one
another
or
with
mankind
we
can
not
precisely
tell
they
like
ourselves
have
the
physical
inheritance
of
form
scent
hearing
sight
and
other
qualities
or
instincts
but
they
have
not
the
mental
inheritance
of
thoughts
and
ideas
handed
down
by
tradition
slow
additions
that
build
up
the
mind
of
the
human
race
and
language
which
is
the
great
educator
of
mankind
is
wanting
in
them
whereas
in
us
language
is
ever
present
even
in
the
infant
the
latent
power
of
naming
is
almost
immediately
observable
and
therefore
the
description
which
has
been
already
given
of
the
nascent
power
of
the
faculties
is
in
reality
an
anticipation
for
simultaneous
with
their
growth
in
man
a
growth
of
language
must
be
supposed
the
child
of
two
years
old
sees
the
fire
once
and
again
and
the
feeble
observation
of
the
same
recurring
object
is
associated
with
the
feeble
utterance
of
the
name
by
which
he
is
taught
to
call
it
soon
he
learns
to
utter
the
name
when
the
object
is
no
longer
there
but
the
desire
or
imagination
of
it
is
present
to
him
at
first
in
every
use
of
the
word
there
is
a
colour
of
sense
an
indistinct
picture
of
the
object
which
accompanies
it
but
in
later
years
he
sees
in
the
name
only
the
universal
or
class
word
and
the
more
abstract
the
notion
becomes
the
more
vacant
is
the
image
which
is
presented
to
him
henceforward
all
the
operations
of
his
mind
including
the
perceptions
of
sense
are
a
synthesis
of
sensations
words
conceptions
in
seeing
or
hearing
or
looking
or
listening
the
sensible
impression
prevails
over
the
conception
and
the
word
in
reflection
the
process
is
reversed
the
outward
object
fades
away
into
nothingness
the
name
or
the
conception
or
both
together
are
everything
language
like
number
is
intermediate
between
the
two
partaking
of
the
definiteness
of
the
outer
and
of
the
universality
of
the
inner
world
for
logic
teaches
us
that
every
word
is
really
a
universal
and
only
condescends
by
the
help
of
position
or
circumlocution
to
become
the
expression
of
individuals
or
particulars
and
sometimes
by
using
words
as
symbols
we
are
able
to
give
a
habitation
and
a
name
to
the
infinite
and
inconceivable
thus
we
see
that
no
line
can
be
drawn
between
the
powers
of
sense
and
of
reflection
they
pass
imperceptibly
into
one
another
we
may
indeed
distinguish
between
the
seeing
and
the
closed
eye
between
the
sensation
and
the
recollection
of
it
but
this
distinction
carries
us
a
very
little
way
for
recollection
is
present
in
sight
as
well
as
sight
in
recollection
there
is
no
impression
of
sense
which
does
not
simultaneously
recall
differences
of
form
number
colour
and
the
like
neither
is
such
a
distinction
applicable
at
all
to
our
internal
bodily
sensations
which
give
no
sign
of
themselves
when
unaccompanied
with
pain
and
even
when
we
are
most
conscious
of
them
have
often
no
assignable
place
in
the
human
frame
who
can
divide
the
nerves
or
great
nervous
centres
from
the
mind
which
uses
them
who
can
separate
the
pains
and
pleasures
of
the
mind
from
the
pains
and
pleasures
of
the
body
the
words
and
outward
and
passive
and
body
are
best
conceived
by
us
as
differences
of
degree
passing
into
differences
of
kind
and
at
one
time
and
under
one
aspect
acting
in
harmony
and
then
again
opposed
they
introduce
a
system
and
order
into
the
knowledge
of
our
being
and
yet
like
many
other
general
terms
are
often
in
advance
of
our
actual
analysis
or
observation
according
to
some
writers
the
inward
sense
is
only
the
fading
away
or
imperfect
realization
of
the
outward
but
this
leaves
out
of
sight
one
half
of
the
phenomenon
for
the
mind
is
not
only
withdrawn
from
the
world
of
sense
but
introduced
to
a
higher
world
of
thought
and
reflection
in
which
like
the
outward
sense
she
is
trained
and
educated
by
use
the
outward
sense
becomes
keener
and
more
intense
especially
when
confined
within
narrow
limits
the
savage
with
little
or
no
thought
has
a
quicker
discernment
of
the
track
than
the
civilised
man
in
like
manner
the
dog
having
the
help
of
scent
as
well
as
of
sight
is
superior
to
the
savage
by
use
again
the
inward
thought
becomes
more
defined
and
distinct
what
was
at
first
an
effort
is
made
easy
by
the
natural
instrumentality
of
language
and
the
mind
learns
to
grasp
universals
with
no
more
exertion
than
is
required
for
the
sight
of
an
outward
object
there
is
a
natural
connexion
and
arrangement
of
them
like
the
association
of
objects
in
a
landscape
just
as
a
note
or
two
of
music
suffices
to
recall
a
whole
piece
to
the
musician
or
mind
so
a
great
principle
or
leading
thought
suggests
and
arranges
a
world
of
particulars
the
power
of
reflection
is
not
feebler
than
the
faculty
of
sense
but
of
a
higher
and
more
comprehensive
nature
it
not
only
receives
the
universals
of
sense
but
gives
them
a
new
content
by
comparing
and
combining
them
with
one
another
it
withdraws
from
the
seen
that
it
may
dwell
in
the
unseen
the
sense
only
presents
us
with
a
flat
and
impenetrable
surface
the
mind
takes
the
world
to
pieces
and
puts
it
together
on
a
new
pattern
the
universals
which
are
detached
from
sense
are
reconstructed
in
science
they
and
not
the
mere
impressions
of
sense
are
the
truth
of
the
world
in
which
we
live
and
as
an
argument
to
those
who
will
only
believe
they
can
hold
in
their
hands
we
may
further
observe
that
they
are
the
source
of
our
power
over
it
to
say
that
the
outward
sense
is
stronger
than
the
inward
is
like
saying
that
the
arm
of
the
workman
is
stronger
than
the
constructing
or
directing
mind
returning
to
the
senses
we
may
briefly
consider
two
questions
first
their
relation
to
the
mind
secondly
their
relation
to
outward
objects
the
senses
are
not
merely
set
in
a
wooden
horse
theaet
but
instruments
of
the
mind
with
which
they
are
organically
connected
there
is
no
use
of
them
without
some
use
of
words
some
natural
or
latent
logic
some
previous
experience
or
observation
sensation
like
all
other
mental
processes
is
complex
and
relative
though
apparently
simple
the
senses
mutually
confirm
and
support
one
another
it
is
hard
to
say
how
much
our
impressions
of
hearing
may
be
affected
by
those
of
sight
or
how
far
our
impressions
of
sight
may
be
corrected
by
the
touch
especially
in
infancy
the
confirmation
of
them
by
one
another
can
not
of
course
be
given
by
any
one
of
them
many
intuitions
which
are
inseparable
from
the
act
of
sense
are
really
the
result
of
complicated
reasonings
the
most
cursory
glance
at
objects
enables
the
experienced
eye
to
judge
approximately
of
their
relations
and
distance
although
nothing
is
impressed
upon
the
retina
except
colour
including
gradations
of
light
and
shade
from
these
delicate
and
almost
imperceptible
differences
we
seem
chiefly
to
derive
our
ideas
of
distance
and
position
by
comparison
of
what
is
near
with
what
is
distant
we
learn
that
the
tree
house
river
etc
which
are
a
long
way
off
are
objects
of
a
like
nature
with
those
which
are
seen
by
us
in
our
immediate
neighbourhood
although
the
actual
impression
made
on
the
eye
is
very
different
in
one
case
and
in
the
other
this
is
a
language
of
and
small
letters
republic
slightly
differing
in
form
and
exquisitely
graduated
by
distance
which
we
are
learning
all
our
life
long
and
which
we
attain
in
various
degrees
according
to
our
powers
of
sight
or
observation
there
is
nor
the
consideration
the
greater
or
less
strain
upon
the
nerves
of
the
eye
or
ear
is
communicated
to
the
mind
and
silently
informs
the
judgment
we
have
also
the
use
not
of
one
eye
only
but
of
two
which
give
us
a
wider
range
and
help
us
to
discern
by
the
greater
or
less
acuteness
of
the
angle
which
the
rays
of
sight
form
the
distance
of
an
object
and
its
relation
to
other
objects
but
we
are
already
passing
beyond
the
limits
of
our
actual
knowledge
on
a
subject
which
has
given
rise
to
many
conjectures
more
important
than
the
addition
of
another
conjecture
is
the
observation
whether
in
the
case
of
sight
or
of
any
other
sense
of
the
great
complexity
of
the
causes
and
the
great
simplicity
of
the
effect
the
sympathy
of
the
mind
and
the
ear
is
no
less
striking
than
the
sympathy
of
the
mind
and
the
eye
do
we
not
seem
to
perceive
instinctively
and
as
an
act
of
sense
the
differences
of
articulate
speech
and
of
musical
notes
yet
how
small
a
part
of
speech
or
of
music
is
produced
by
the
impression
of
the
ear
compared
with
that
which
is
furnished
by
the
mind
again
the
more
refined
faculty
of
sense
as
in
animals
so
also
in
man
seems
often
to
be
transmitted
by
inheritance
neither
must
we
forget
that
in
the
use
of
the
senses
as
in
his
whole
nature
man
is
a
social
being
who
is
always
being
educated
by
language
habit
and
the
teaching
of
other
men
as
well
as
by
his
own
observation
he
knows
distance
because
he
is
taught
it
by
a
more
experienced
judgment
than
his
own
he
distinguishes
sounds
because
he
is
told
to
remark
them
by
a
person
of
a
more
discerning
ear
and
as
we
inherit
from
our
parents
or
other
ancestors
peculiar
powers
of
sense
or
feeling
so
we
improve
and
strengthen
them
not
only
by
regular
teaching
but
also
by
sympathy
and
communion
with
other
persons
the
second
question
namely
that
concerning
the
relation
of
the
mind
to
external
objects
is
really
a
trifling
one
though
it
has
been
made
the
subject
of
a
famous
philosophy
we
may
if
we
like
with
berkeley
resolve
objects
of
sense
into
sensations
but
the
change
is
one
of
name
only
and
nothing
is
gained
and
something
is
lost
by
such
a
resolution
or
confusion
of
them
for
we
have
not
really
made
a
single
step
towards
idealism
and
any
arbitrary
inversion
of
our
ordinary
modes
of
speech
is
disturbing
to
the
mind
the
youthful
metaphysician
is
delighted
at
his
marvellous
discovery
that
nothing
is
and
that
what
we
see
or
feel
is
our
sensation
only
for
a
day
or
two
the
world
has
a
new
interest
to
him
he
alone
knows
the
secret
which
has
been
communicated
to
him
by
the
philosopher
that
mind
is
all
when
in
fact
he
is
going
out
of
his
mind
in
the
first
intoxication
of
a
great
thought
but
he
soon
finds
that
all
things
remain
as
they
were
the
laws
of
motion
the
properties
of
matter
the
qualities
of
substances
after
having
inflicted
his
theories
on
any
one
who
is
willing
to
receive
them
on
his
father
and
mother
secondly
on
some
other
patient
listener
thirdly
on
his
dog
he
finds
that
he
only
differs
from
the
rest
of
mankind
in
the
use
of
a
word
he
had
once
hoped
that
by
getting
rid
of
the
solidity
of
matter
he
might
open
a
passage
to
worlds
beyond
he
liked
to
think
of
the
world
as
the
representation
of
the
divine
nature
and
delighted
to
imagine
angels
and
spirits
wandering
through
space
present
in
the
room
in
which
he
is
sitting
without
coming
through
the
door
nowhere
and
everywhere
at
the
same
instant
at
length
he
finds
that
he
has
been
the
victim
of
his
own
fancies
he
has
neither
more
nor
less
evidence
of
the
supernatural
than
he
had
before
he
himself
has
become
unsettled
but
the
laws
of
the
world
remain
fixed
as
at
the
beginning
he
has
discovered
that
his
appeal
to
the
fallibility
of
sense
was
really
an
illusion
for
whatever
uncertainty
there
may
be
in
the
appearances
of
nature
arises
only
out
of
the
imperfection
or
variation
of
the
human
senses
or
possibly
from
the
deficiency
of
certain
branches
of
knowledge
when
science
is
able
to
apply
her
tests
the
uncertainty
is
at
an
end
we
are
apt
sometimes
to
think
that
moral
and
metaphysical
philosophy
are
lowered
by
the
influence
which
is
exercised
over
them
by
physical
science
but
any
interpretation
of
nature
by
physical
science
is
far
in
advance
of
such
idealism
the
philosophy
of
berkeley
while
giving
unbounded
license
to
the
imagination
is
still
grovelling
on
the
level
of
sense
we
may
if
we
please
carry
this
scepticism
a
step
further
and
deny
not
only
objects
of
sense
but
the
continuity
of
our
sensations
themselves
we
may
say
with
protagoras
and
hume
that
what
is
appears
and
that
what
appears
appears
only
to
individuals
and
to
the
same
individual
only
at
one
instant
but
then
as
plato
asks
and
we
must
repeat
the
question
what
becomes
of
the
mind
experience
tells
us
by
a
thousand
proofs
that
our
sensations
of
colour
taste
and
the
like
are
the
same
as
they
were
an
instant
ago
that
the
act
which
we
are
performing
one
minute
is
continued
by
us
in
the
next
and
also
supplies
abundant
proof
that
the
perceptions
of
other
men
are
speaking
generally
the
same
or
nearly
the
same
with
our
own
after
having
slowly
and
laboriously
in
the
course
of
ages
gained
a
conception
of
a
whole
and
parts
of
the
constitution
of
the
mind
of
the
relation
of
man
to
god
and
nature
imperfect
indeed
but
the
best
we
can
we
are
asked
to
return
again
to
the
elements
of
ancient
scepticism
and
acknowledge
only
atoms
and
sensations
devoid
of
life
or
unity
why
should
we
not
go
a
step
further
still
and
doubt
the
existence
of
the
senses
of
all
things
we
are
but
stuff
as
dreams
are
made
of
for
we
have
left
ourselves
no
instruments
of
thought
by
which
we
can
distinguish
man
from
the
animals
or
conceive
of
the
existence
even
of
a
mollusc
and
observe
this
extreme
scepticism
has
been
allowed
to
spring
up
among
us
not
like
the
ancient
scepticism
in
an
age
when
nature
and
language
really
seemed
to
be
full
of
illusions
but
in
the
eighteenth
and
nineteenth
centuries
when
men
walk
in
the
daylight
of
inductive
science
the
attractiveness
of
such
speculations
arises
out
of
their
true
nature
not
being
perceived
they
are
veiled
in
graceful
language
they
are
not
pushed
to
extremes
they
stop
where
the
human
mind
is
disposed
also
to
stop
short
of
a
manifest
absurdity
their
inconsistency
is
not
observed
by
their
authors
or
by
mankind
in
general
who
are
equally
inconsistent
themselves
they
leave
on
the
mind
a
pleasing
sense
of
wonder
and
novelty
in
youth
they
seem
to
have
a
natural
affinity
to
one
class
of
persons
as
poetry
has
to
another
but
in
later
life
either
we
drift
back
into
common
sense
or
we
make
them
the
of
a
higher
philosophy
we
are
often
told
that
we
should
enquire
into
all
things
before
we
accept
them
with
what
limitations
is
this
true
for
we
can
not
use
our
senses
without
admitting
that
we
have
them
or
think
without
presupposing
that
there
is
in
us
a
power
of
thought
or
affirm
that
all
knowledge
is
derived
from
experience
without
implying
that
this
first
principle
of
knowledge
is
prior
to
experience
the
truth
seems
to
be
that
we
begin
with
the
natural
use
of
the
mind
as
of
the
body
and
we
seek
to
describe
this
as
well
as
we
can
we
eat
before
we
know
the
nature
of
digestion
we
think
before
we
know
the
nature
of
reflection
as
our
knowledge
increases
our
perception
of
the
mind
enlarges
also
we
can
not
indeed
get
beyond
facts
but
neither
can
we
draw
any
line
which
separates
facts
from
ideas
and
the
mind
is
not
something
separate
from
them
but
included
in
them
and
they
in
the
mind
both
having
a
distinctness
and
individuality
of
their
own
to
reduce
our
conception
of
mind
to
a
succession
of
feelings
and
sensations
is
like
the
attempt
to
view
a
wide
prospect
by
inches
through
a
microscope
or
to
calculate
a
period
of
chronology
by
minutes
the
mind
ceases
to
exist
when
it
loses
its
continuity
which
though
far
from
being
its
highest
determination
is
yet
necessary
to
any
conception
of
it
even
an
inanimate
nature
can
not
be
adequately
represented
as
an
endless
succession
of
states
or
conditions
paragraph
ii
another
division
of
the
subject
has
yet
to
be
considered
why
should
the
doctrine
that
knowledge
is
sensation
in
ancient
times
or
of
sensationalism
or
materialism
in
modern
times
be
allied
to
the
lower
rather
than
to
the
higher
view
of
ethical
philosophy
at
first
sight
the
nature
and
origin
of
knowledge
appear
to
be
wholly
disconnected
from
ethics
and
religion
nor
can
we
deny
that
the
ancient
stoics
were
materialists
or
that
the
materialist
doctrines
prevalent
in
modern
times
have
been
associated
with
great
virtues
or
that
both
religious
and
philosophical
idealism
have
not
unfrequently
parted
company
with
practice
still
upon
the
whole
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
higher
standard
of
duty
has
gone
hand
in
hand
with
the
higher
conception
of
knowledge
it
is
protagoras
who
is
seeking
to
adapt
himself
to
the
opinions
of
the
world
it
is
plato
who
rises
above
them
the
one
maintaining
that
all
knowledge
is
sensation
the
other
basing
the
virtues
on
the
idea
of
good
the
reason
of
this
phenomenon
has
now
to
be
examined
by
those
who
rest
knowledge
immediately
upon
sense
that
explanation
of
human
action
is
deemed
to
be
the
truest
which
is
nearest
to
sense
as
knowledge
is
reduced
to
sensation
so
virtue
is
reduced
to
feeling
happiness
or
good
to
pleasure
the
different
virtues
the
various
characters
which
exist
in
the
world
are
the
disguises
of
human
nature
is
dried
up
there
is
no
place
left
for
imagination
or
in
any
higher
sense
for
religion
ideals
of
a
whole
or
of
a
state
or
of
a
law
of
duty
or
of
a
divine
perfection
are
out
of
place
in
an
epicurean
philosophy
the
very
terms
in
which
they
are
expressed
are
suspected
of
having
no
meaning
man
is
to
bring
himself
back
as
far
as
he
is
able
to
the
condition
of
a
rational
beast
he
is
to
limit
himself
to
the
pursuit
of
pleasure
but
of
this
he
is
to
make
a
calculation
he
is
to
be
rationalized
secularized
animalized
or
he
is
to
be
an
amiable
sceptic
better
than
his
own
philosophy
and
not
falling
below
the
opinions
of
the
world
imagination
has
been
called
that
faculty
which
is
always
intruding
upon
us
in
the
search
after
truth
but
imagination
is
also
that
higher
power
by
which
we
rise
above
ourselves
and
the
commonplaces
of
thought
and
life
the
philosophical
imagination
is
another
name
for
reason
finding
an
expression
of
herself
in
the
outward
world
to
deprive
life
of
ideals
is
to
deprive
it
of
all
higher
and
comprehensive
aims
and
of
the
power
of
imparting
and
communicating
them
to
others
for
men
are
taught
not
by
those
who
are
on
a
level
with
them
but
by
those
who
rise
above
them
who
see
the
distant
hills
who
soar
into
the
empyrean
like
a
bird
in
a
cage
the
mind
confined
to
sense
is
always
being
brought
back
from
the
higher
to
the
lower
from
the
wider
to
the
narrower
view
of
human
knowledge
it
seeks
to
fly
but
can
not
instead
of
aspiring
towards
perfection
hovers
about
this
lower
world
and
the
earthly
nature
it
loses
the
religious
sense
which
more
than
any
other
seems
to
take
a
man
out
of
himself
weary
of
asking
is
truth
it
accepts
the
witness
of
eyes
and
ears
it
draws
around
itself
the
curtain
of
the
physical
world
and
is
satisfied
the
strength
of
a
sensational
philosophy
lies
in
the
ready
accommodation
of
it
to
the
minds
of
men
many
who
have
been
metaphysicians
in
their
youth
as
they
advance
in
years
are
prone
to
acquiesce
in
things
as
they
are
or
rather
appear
to
be
they
are
spectators
not
thinkers
and
the
best
philosophy
is
that
which
requires
of
them
the
least
amount
of
mental
effort
as
a
lower
philosophy
is
easier
to
apprehend
than
a
higher
so
a
lower
way
of
life
is
easier
to
follow
and
therefore
such
a
philosophy
seems
to
derive
a
support
from
the
general
practice
of
mankind
it
appeals
to
principles
which
they
all
know
and
recognize
it
gives
back
to
them
in
a
generalized
form
the
results
of
their
own
experience
to
the
man
of
the
world
they
are
the
quintessence
of
his
own
reflections
upon
life
to
follow
custom
to
have
no
new
ideas
or
opinions
not
to
be
straining
after
impossibilities
to
enjoy
with
just
so
much
forethought
as
is
necessary
to
provide
for
the
morrow
this
is
regarded
by
the
greater
part
of
the
world
as
the
natural
way
of
passing
through
existence
and
many
who
have
lived
thus
have
attained
to
a
lower
kind
of
happiness
or
equanimity
they
have
possessed
their
souls
in
peace
without
ever
allowing
them
to
wander
into
the
region
of
religious
or
political
controversy
and
without
any
care
for
the
higher
interests
of
man
but
nearly
all
the
good
as
well
as
some
of
the
evil
which
has
ever
been
done
in
this
world
has
been
the
work
of
another
spirit
the
work
of
enthusiasts
and
idealists
of
apostles
and
martyrs
the
leaders
of
mankind
have
not
been
of
the
gentle
epicurean
type
they
have
personified
ideas
they
have
sometimes
also
been
the
victims
of
them
but
they
have
always
been
seeking
after
a
truth
or
ideal
of
which
they
fell
short
and
have
died
in
a
manner
disappointed
of
their
hopes
that
they
might
lift
the
human
race
out
of
the
slough
in
which
they
found
them
they
have
done
little
compared
with
their
own
visions
and
aspirations
but
they
have
done
that
little
only
because
they
sought
to
do
and
once
perhaps
thought
that
they
were
doing
a
great
deal
more
the
philosophies
of
epicurus
or
hume
give
no
adequate
or
dignified
conception
of
the
mind
there
is
no
organic
unity
in
a
succession
of
feeling
or
sensations
no
comprehensiveness
in
an
infinity
of
separate
actions
the
individual
never
reflects
upon
himself
as
a
whole
he
can
hardly
regard
one
act
or
part
of
his
life
as
the
cause
or
effect
of
any
other
act
or
part
whether
in
practice
or
speculation
he
is
to
himself
only
in
successive
instants
to
such
thinkers
whether
in
ancient
or
in
modern
times
the
mind
is
only
the
poor
recipient
of
impressions
not
the
heir
of
all
the
ages
or
connected
with
all
other
minds
it
begins
again
with
its
own
modicum
of
experience
having
only
such
vague
conceptions
of
the
wisdom
of
the
past
as
are
inseparable
from
language
and
popular
opinion
it
seeks
to
explain
from
the
experience
of
the
individual
what
can
only
be
learned
from
the
history
of
the
world
it
has
no
conception
of
obligation
duty
conscience
these
are
to
the
epicurean
or
utilitarian
philosopher
only
names
which
interfere
with
our
natural
perceptions
of
pleasure
and
pain
there
seem
then
to
be
several
answers
to
the
question
why
the
theory
that
all
knowledge
is
sensation
is
allied
to
the
lower
rather
than
to
the
higher
view
of
ethical
philosophy
because
it
is
easier
to
understand
and
practise
because
it
is
fatal
to
the
pursuit
of
ideals
moral
political
or
religious
because
it
deprives
us
of
the
means
and
instruments
of
higher
thought
of
any
adequate
conception
of
the
mind
of
knowledge
of
conscience
of
moral
obligation

since
the
above
essay
first
appeared
many
books
on
psychology
have
been
given
to
the
world
partly
based
upon
the
views
of
herbart
and
other
german
philosophers
partly
independent
of
them
the
subject
has
gained
in
bulk
and
extent
whether
it
has
had
any
true
growth
is
more
doubtful
it
begins
to
assume
the
language
and
claim
the
authority
of
a
science
but
it
is
only
an
hypothesis
or
outline
which
may
be
filled
up
in
many
ways
according
to
the
fancy
of
individual
thinkers
the
basis
of
it
is
a
precarious
one
consciousness
of
ourselves
and
a
somewhat
uncertain
observation
of
the
rest
of
mankind
its
relations
to
other
sciences
are
not
yet
determined
they
seem
to
be
almost
too
complicated
to
be
ascertained
it
may
be
compared
to
an
irregular
building
run
up
hastily
and
not
likely
to
last
because
its
foundations
are
weak
and
in
many
places
rest
only
on
the
surface
of
the
ground
it
has
sought
rather
to
put
together
scattered
observations
and
to
make
them
into
a
system
than
to
describe
or
prove
them
it
has
never
severely
drawn
the
line
between
facts
and
opinions
it
has
substituted
a
technical
phraseology
for
the
common
use
of
language
being
neither
able
to
win
acceptance
for
the
one
nor
to
get
rid
of
the
other
the
system
which
has
thus
arisen
appears
to
be
a
kind
of
metaphysic
narrowed
to
the
point
of
view
of
the
individual
mind
through
which
as
through
some
new
optical
instrument
limiting
the
sphere
of
vision
the
interior
of
thought
and
sensation
is
examined
but
the
individual
mind
in
the
abstract
as
distinct
from
the
mind
of
a
particular
individual
and
separated
from
the
environment
of
circumstances
is
a
fiction
only
yet
facts
which
are
partly
true
gather
around
this
fiction
and
are
naturally
described
by
the
help
of
it
there
is
also
a
common
type
of
the
mind
which
is
derived
from
the
comparison
of
many
minds
with
one
another
and
with
our
own
the
phenomena
of
which
psychology
treats
are
familiar
to
us
but
they
are
for
the
most
part
indefinite
they
relate
to
a
something
inside
the
body
which
seems
also
to
overleap
the
limits
of
space
the
operations
of
this
something
when
isolated
can
not
be
analyzed
by
us
or
subjected
to
observation
and
experiment
and
there
is
another
point
to
be
considered
the
mind
when
thinking
can
not
survey
that
part
of
itself
which
is
used
in
thought
it
can
only
be
contemplated
in
the
past
that
is
to
say
in
the
history
of
the
individual
or
of
the
world
this
is
the
scientific
method
of
studying
the
mind
but
psychology
has
also
some
other
supports
specious
rather
than
real
it
is
partly
sustained
by
the
false
analogy
of
physical
science
and
has
great
expectations
from
its
near
relationship
to
physiology
we
truly
remark
that
there
is
an
infinite
complexity
of
the
body
corresponding
to
the
infinite
subtlety
of
the
mind
we
are
conscious
that
they
are
very
nearly
connected
but
in
endeavouring
to
trace
the
nature
of
the
connexion
we
are
baffled
and
disappointed
in
our
knowledge
of
them
the
gulf
remains
the
same
no
microscope
has
ever
seen
into
thought
no
reflection
on
ourselves
has
supplied
the
missing
link
between
mind
and
matter
these
are
the
conditions
of
this
very
inexact
science
and
we
shall
only
know
less
of
it
by
pretending
to
know
more
or
by
assigning
to
it
a
form
or
style
to
which
it
has
not
yet
attained
and
is
not
really
entitled
experience
shows
that
any
system
however
baseless
and
ineffectual
in
our
own
or
in
any
other
age
may
be
accepted
and
continue
to
be
studied
if
it
seeks
to
satisfy
some
unanswered
question
or
is
based
upon
some
ancient
tradition
especially
if
it
takes
the
form
and
uses
the
language
of
inductive
philosophy
the
fact
therefore
that
such
a
science
exists
and
is
popular
affords
no
evidence
of
its
truth
or
value
many
who
have
pursued
it
far
into
detail
have
never
examined
the
foundations
on
which
it
rests
the
have
been
many
imaginary
subjects
of
knowledge
of
which
enthusiastic
persons
have
made
a
lifelong
study
without
ever
asking
themselves
what
is
the
evidence
for
them
what
is
the
use
of
them
how
long
they
will
last
they
may
pass
away
like
the
authors
of
them
and
not
a
wrack
behind
or
they
may
survive
in
fragments
nor
is
it
only
in
the
middle
ages
or
in
the
literary
desert
of
china
or
of
india
that
such
systems
have
arisen
in
our
own
enlightened
age
growing
up
by
the
side
of
physics
ethics
and
other
really
progressive
sciences
there
is
a
weary
waste
of
knowledge
falsely
there
are
sham
sciences
which
no
logic
has
ever
put
to
the
test
in
which
the
desire
for
knowledge
invents
the
materials
of
it
and
therefore
it
is
expedient
once
more
to
review
the
bases
of
psychology
lest
we
should
be
imposed
upon
by
its
pretensions
the
study
of
it
may
have
done
good
service
by
awakening
us
to
the
sense
of
inveterate
errors
familiarized
by
language
yet
it
may
have
fallen
into
still
greater
ones
under
the
pretence
of
new
investigations
it
may
be
wasting
the
lives
of
those
who
are
engaged
in
it
it
may
also
be
found
that
the
discussion
of
it
will
throw
light
upon
some
points
in
the
theaetetus
of
plato
the
oldest
work
on
psychology
which
has
come
down
to
us
the
imaginary
science
may
be
called
in
the
language
of
ancient
philosophy
shadow
of
a
part
of
dialectic
or
metaphysic
in
this
postscript
or
appendix
we
propose
to
treat
first
of
the
true
bases
of
psychology
secondly
of
the
errors
into
which
the
students
of
it
are
most
likely
to
fall
thirdly
of
the
principal
subjects
which
are
usually
comprehended
under
it
fourthly
of
the
form
which
facts
relating
to
the
mind
most
naturally
assume
we
may
preface
the
enquiry
by
two
or
three
remarks
we
do
not
claim
for
the
popular
psychology
the
position
of
a
science
at
all
it
can
not
like
the
physical
sciences
proceed
by
the
inductive
method
it
has
not
the
necessity
of
mathematics
it
does
not
like
metaphysic
argue
from
abstract
notions
or
from
internal
coherence
it
is
made
up
of
scattered
observations
a
few
of
these
though
they
may
sometimes
appear
to
be
truisms
are
of
the
greatest
value
and
free
from
all
doubt
we
are
conscious
of
them
in
ourselves
we
observe
them
working
in
others
we
are
assured
of
them
at
all
times
for
example
we
are
absolutely
certain
a
of
the
influence
exerted
by
the
mind
over
the
body
or
by
the
body
over
the
mind
b
of
the
power
of
association
by
which
the
appearance
of
some
person
or
the
occurrence
of
some
event
recalls
to
mind
not
always
but
often
other
persons
and
events
c
of
the
effect
of
habit
which
is
strongest
when
least
disturbed
by
reflection
and
is
to
the
mind
what
the
bones
are
to
the
body
d
of
the
real
though
not
unlimited
freedom
of
the
human
will
e
of
the
reference
more
or
less
distinct
of
our
sensations
feelings
thoughts
actions
to
ourselves
which
is
called
consciousness
or
when
in
excess
f
of
the
distinction
of
the
and
i
of
ourselves
and
outward
objects
but
when
we
attempt
to
gather
up
these
elements
in
a
single
system
we
discover
that
the
links
by
which
we
combine
them
are
apt
to
be
mere
words
we
are
in
a
country
which
has
never
been
cleared
or
surveyed
here
and
there
only
does
a
gleam
of
light
come
through
the
darkness
of
the
forest
these
fragments
although
they
can
never
become
science
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
word
are
a
real
part
of
knowledge
and
may
be
of
great
value
in
education
we
may
be
able
to
add
a
good
deal
to
them
from
our
own
experience
and
we
may
verify
them
by
it
is
one
of
those
studies
which
a
man
can
pursue
alone
by
attention
to
himself
and
the
processes
of
his
individual
mind
he
may
learn
much
about
his
own
character
and
about
the
character
of
others
if
he
will
his
mind
sit
down
and
look
at
itself
in
the
glass
the
great
if
not
the
only
use
of
such
a
study
is
a
practical
one
to
know
first
human
nature
and
secondly
our
own
nature
as
it
truly
is
hence
it
is
important
that
we
should
conceive
of
the
mind
in
the
noblest
and
simplest
manner
while
acknowledging
that
language
has
been
the
greatest
factor
in
the
formation
of
human
thought
we
must
endeavour
to
get
rid
of
the
disguises
oppositions
contradictions
which
arise
out
of
it
we
must
disengage
ourselves
from
the
ideas
which
the
customary
use
of
words
has
implanted
in
us
to
avoid
error
as
much
as
possible
when
we
are
speaking
of
things
unseen
the
principal
terms
which
we
use
should
be
few
and
we
should
not
allow
ourselves
to
be
enslaved
by
them
instead
of
seeking
to
frame
a
technical
language
we
should
vary
our
forms
of
speech
lest
they
should
degenerate
into
formulas
a
difficult
philosophical
problem
is
better
understood
when
translated
into
the
vernacular
psychology
is
inseparable
from
language
and
early
language
contains
the
first
impressions
or
the
oldest
experience
of
man
respecting
himself
these
impressions
are
not
accurate
representations
of
the
truth
they
are
the
reflections
of
a
rudimentary
age
of
philosophy
the
first
and
simplest
forms
of
thought
are
rooted
so
deep
in
human
nature
that
they
can
never
be
got
rid
of
but
they
have
been
perpetually
enlarged
and
elevated
and
the
use
of
many
words
has
been
transferred
from
the
body
to
the
mind
the
spiritual
and
intellectual
have
thus
become
separated
from
the
material
there
is
a
cleft
between
them
and
the
heart
and
the
conscience
of
man
rise
above
the
dominion
of
the
appetites
and
create
a
new
language
in
which
they
too
find
expression
as
the
differences
of
actions
begin
to
be
perceived
more
and
more
names
are
needed
this
is
the
first
analysis
of
the
human
mind
having
a
general
foundation
in
popular
experience
it
is
moulded
to
a
certain
extent
by
hierophants
and
philosophers
see
introd
to
cratylus
b
this
primitive
psychology
is
continually
receiving
additions
from
the
first
thinkers
who
in
return
take
a
colour
from
the
popular
language
of
the
time
the
mind
is
regarded
from
new
points
of
view
and
becomes
adapted
to
new
conditions
of
knowledge
it
seeks
to
isolate
itself
from
matter
and
sense
and
to
assert
its
independence
in
thought
it
recognizes
that
it
is
independent
of
the
external
world
it
has
five
or
six
natural
states
or
stages
sensation
in
which
it
is
almost
latent
or
quiescent
feeling
or
inner
sense
when
the
mind
is
just
awakening
memory
which
is
decaying
sense
and
from
time
to
time
as
with
a
spark
or
flash
has
the
power

recollecting
or
reanimating
the

in
which
the

moves
forward
of
itself
or
under
the
impulse
of

or

or

to

avoid
some
end
or

and
there
is
the
composition
of
these
or
the
admixture
or
assimilation
of
them
in
various
degrees
we
never
see
these
processes
of
the
mind
nor
can
we
tell
the
causes
of
them
but
we
know
them
by
their
results
and
learn
from
other
men
that
so
far
as
we
can
describe
to
them
or
they
to
us
the
workings
of
the
mind
their
experience
is
the
same
or
nearly
the
same
with
our
own
but
the
knowledge
of
the
mind
is
not
to
any
great
extent
derived
from
the
observation
of
the
individual
by
himself
it
is
the
growing
consciousness
of
the
human
race
embodied
in
language
acknowledged
by
experience
and
corrected
from
time
to
time
by
the
influence
of
literature
and
philosophy
a
great
perhaps
the
most
important
part
of
it
is
to
be
found
in
early
greek
thought
in
the
theaetetus
of
plato
it
has
not
yet
become
fixed
we
are
still
stumbling
on
the
threshold
in
aristotle
the
process
is
more
nearly
completed
and
has
gained
innumerable
abstractions
of
which
many
have
had
to
be
thrown
away
because
relative
only
to
the
controversies
of
the
time
in
the
interval
between
thales
and
aristotle
were
realized
the
distinctions
of
mind
and
body
of
universal
and
particular
of
infinite
and
infinitesimal
of
idea
and
phenomenon
the
class
conceptions
of
faculties
and
virtues
the
antagonism
of
the
appetites
and
the
reason
and
connected
with
this
at
a
higher
stage
of
development
the
opposition
of
moral
and
intellectual
virtue
also
the
primitive
conceptions
of
unity
being
rest
motion
and
the
like
these
divisions
were
not
really
scientific
but
rather
based
on
popular
experience
they
were
not
held
with
the
precision
of
modern
thinkers
but
taken
all
together
they
gave
a
new
existence
to
the
mind
in
thought
and
greatly
enlarged
and
more
accurately
defined
knowledge
of
himself
and
of
the
world
the
majority
of
them
have
been
accepted
by
christian
and
western
nations
yet
in
modern
times
we
have
also
drifted
so
far
away
from
aristotle
that
if
we
were
to
frame
a
system
on
his
lines
we
should
be
at
war
with
ordinary
language
and
untrue
to
our
own
consciousness
and
there
have
been
a
few
both
in
mediaeval
times
and
since
the
reformation
who
have
rebelled
against
the
aristotelian
point
of
view
of
these
eccentric
thinkers
there
have
been
various
types
but
they
have
all
a
family
likeness
according
to
them
there
has
been
too
much
analysis
and
too
little
synthesis
too
much
division
of
the
mind
into
parts
and
too
little
conception
of
it
as
a
whole
or
in
its
relation
to
god
and
the
laws
of
the
universe
they
have
thought
that
the
elements
of
plurality
and
unity
have
not
been
duly
adjusted
the
tendency
of
such
writers
has
been
to
allow
the
personality
of
man
to
be
absorbed
in
the
universal
or
in
the
divine
nature
and
to
deny
the
distinction
between
matter
and
mind
or
to
substitute
one
for
the
other
they
have
broken
some
of
the
idols
of
psychology
they
have
challenged
the
received
meaning
of
words
they
have
regarded
the
mind
under
many
points
of
view
but
though
they
may
have
shaken
the
old
they
have
not
established
the
new
their
views
of
philosophy
which
seem
like
the
echo
of
some
voice
from
the
east
have
been
alien
to
the
mind
of
europe
the
psychology
which
is
found
in
common
language
is
in
some
degree
verified
by
experience
but
not
in
such
a
manner
as
to
give
it
the
character
of
an
exact
science
we
can
not
say
that
words
always
correspond
to
facts
common
language
represents
the
mind
from
different
and
even
opposite
points
of
view
which
can
not
be
all
of
them
equally
true
compare
cratylus
yet
from
diversity
of
statements
and
opinions
may
be
obtained
a
nearer
approach
to
the
truth
than
is
to
be
gained
from
any
one
of
them
it
also
tends
to
correct
itself
because
it
is
gradually
brought
nearer
to
the
common
sense
of
mankind
there
are
some
leading
categories
or
classifications
of
thought
which
though
unverified
must
always
remain
the
elements
from
which
the
science
or
study
of
the
mind
proceeds
for
example
we
must
assume
ideas
before
we
can
analyze
them
and
also
a
continuing
mind
to
which
they
belong
the
resolution
of
it
into
successive
moments
which
would
say
with
protagoras
that
the
man
is
not
the
same
person
which
he
was
a
minute
ago
is
as
plato
implies
in
the
theaetetus
an
absurdity
the
growth
of
the
mind
which
may
be
traced
in
the
histories
of
religions
and
philosophies
and
in
the
thoughts
of
nations
is
one
of
the
deepest
and
noblest
modes
of
studying
it
here
we
are
dealing
with
the
reality
with
the
greater
and
as
it
may
be
termed
the
most
sacred
part
of
history
we
study
the
mind
of
man
as
it
begins
to
be
inspired
by
a
human
or
divine
reason
as
it
is
modified
by
circumstances
as
it
is
distributed
in
nations
as
it
is
renovated
by
great
movements
which
go
beyond
the
limits
of
nations
and
affect
human
society
on
a
scale
still
greater
as
it
is
created
or
renewed
by
great
minds
who
looking
down
from
above
have
a
wider
and
more
comprehensive
vision
this
is
an
ambitious
study
of
which
most
of
us
rather
than
arrive
at
any
detailed
or
accurate
knowledge
later
arises
the
reflection
how
these
great
ideas
or
movements
of
the
world
have
been
appropriated
by
the
multitude
and
found
a
way
to
the
minds
of
individuals
the
real
psychology
is
that
which
shows
how
the
increasing
knowledge
of
nature
and
the
increasing
experience
of
life
have
always
been
slowly
transforming
the
mind
how
religions
too
have
been
modified
in
the
course
of
ages

lastly
though
we
speak
of
the
study
of
mind
in
a
special
sense
it
may
also
be
said
that
there
is
no
science
which
does
not
contribute
to
our
knowledge
of
it
the
methods
of
science
and
their
analogies
are
new
faculties
discovered
by
the
few
and
imparted
to
the
many
they
are
to
the
mind
what
the
senses
are
to
the
body
or
better
they
may
be
compared
to
instruments
such
as
the
telescope
or
microscope
by
which
the
discriminating
power
of
the
senses
or
to
other
mechanical
inventions
by
which
the
strength
and
skill
of
the
human
body
is
so
immeasurably
increased
ii
the
new
psychology
whatever
may
be
its
claim
to
the
authority
of
a
science
has
called
attention
to
many
facts
and
corrected
many
errors
which
without
it
would
have
been
unexamined
yet
it
is
also
itself
very
liable
to
illusion
the
evidence
on
which
it
rests
is
vague
and
indefinite
the
field
of
consciousness
is
never
seen
by
us
as
a
whole
but
only
at
particular
points
which
are
always
changing
the
veil
of
language
intercepts
facts
hence
it
is
desirable
that
in
making
an
approach
to
the
study
we
should
consider
at
the
outset
what
are
the
kinds
of
error
which
most
easily
affect
it
and
note
the
differences
which
separate
it
from
other
branches
of
knowledge
a
first
we
observe
the
mind
by
the
mind
it
would
seem
therefore
that
we
are
always
in
danger
of
leaving
out
the
half
of
that
which
is
the
subject
of
our
enquiry
we
come
at
once
upon
the
difficulty
of
what
is
the
meaning
of
the
word
does
it
differ
as
subject
and
object
in
the
same
manner
can
we
suppose
one
set
of
feelings
or
one
part
of
the
mind
to
interpret
another
is
the
introspecting
thought
the
same
with
the
thought
which
is
introspected
has
the
mind
the
power
of
surveying
its
whole
domain
at
one
and
the
same
time
no
more
than
the
eye
can
take
in
the
whole
human
body
at
a
glance
yet
there
may
be
a
glimpse
round
the
corner
or
a
thought
transferred
in
a
moment
from
one
point
of
view
to
another
which
enables
us
to
see
nearly
the
whole
if
not
at
once
at
any
rate
in
succession
such
glimpses
will
hardly
enable
us
to
contemplate
from
within
the
mind
in
its
true
proportions
hence
the
firmer
ground
of
psychology
is
not
the
consciousness
of
inward
feelings
but
the
observation
of
external
actions
being
the
actions
not
only
of
ourselves
but
of
the
innumerable
persons
whom
we
come
across
in
life
b
the
error
of
supposing
partial
or
occasional
explanation
of
mental
phenomena
to
be
the
only
or
complete
ones
for
example
we
are
disinclined
to
admit
of
the
spontaneity
or
discontinuity
of
the
mind
it
seems
to
us
like
an
effect
without
a
cause
and
therefore
we
suppose
the
train
of
our
thoughts
to
be
always
called
up
by
association
yet
it
is
probable
or
indeed
certain
that
of
many
mental
phenomena
there
are
no
mental
antecedents
but
only
bodily
ones
the
false
influence
of
language
we
are
apt
to
suppose
that
when
there
are
two
or
more
words
describing
faculties
or
processes
of
the
mind
there
are
real
differences
corresponding
to
them
but
this
is
not
the
case
nor
can
we
determine
how
far
they
do
or
do
not
exist
or
by
what
degree
or
kind
of
difference
they
are
distinguished
the
same
remark
may
be
made
about
figures
of
speech
they
fill
up
the
vacancy
of
knowledge
they
are
to
the
mind
what
too
much
colour
is
to
the
eye
but
the
truth
is
rather
concealed
than
revealed
by
them
the
uncertain
meaning
of
terms
such
as
consciousness
conscience
will
law
knowledge
internal
and
external
sense
these
in
the
language
of
plato
shamelessly
use
without
ever
having
taken
the
pains
to
analyze
them
a
science
such
as
psychology
is
not
merely
an
hypothesis
but
an
hypothesis
which
unlike
the
hypotheses
of
physics
can
never
be
verified
it
rests
only
on
the
general
impressions
of
mankind
and
there
is
little
or
no
hope
of
adding
in
any
considerable
degree
to
our
stock
of
mental
facts
the
parallelism
of
the
physical
sciences
which
leads
us
to
analyze
the
mind
on
the
analogy
of
the
body
and
so
to
reduce
mental
operations
to
the
level
of
bodily
ones
or
to
confound
one
with
the
other
that
the
progress
of
physiology
may
throw
a
new
light
on
psychology
is
a
dream
in
which
scientific
men
are
always
tempted
to
indulge
but
however
certain
we
may
be
of
the
connexion
between
mind
and
body
the
explanation
of
the
one
by
the
other
is
a
hidden
place
of
nature
which
has
hitherto
been
investigated
with
little
or
no
success
the
impossibility
of
distinguishing
between
mind
and
body
neither
in
thought
nor
in
experience
can
we
separate
them
they
seem
to
act
together
yet
we
feel
that
we
are
sometimes
under
the
dominion
of
the
one
sometimes
of
the
other
and
sometimes
both
in
the
common
use
of
language
and
in
fact
they
transform
themselves
the
one
into
the
good
principle
the
other
into
the
evil
principle
and
then
again
the
comes
in
and
mediates
between
them
it
is
also
difficult
to
distinguish
outward
facts
from
the
ideas
of
them
in
the
mind
or
to
separate
the
external
stimulus
to
a
sensation
from
the
activity
of
the
organ
or
this
from
the
invisible
agencies
by
which
it
reaches
the
mind
or
any
process
of
sense
from
its
mental
antecedent
or
any
mental
energy
from
its
nervous
expression
i
the
fact
that
mental
divisions
tend
to
run
into
one
another
and
that
in
speaking
of
the
mind
we
can
not
always
distinguish
differences
of
kind
from
differences
of
degree
nor
have
we
any
measure
of
the
strength
and
intensity
of
our
ideas
or
feelings
j
although
heredity
has
been
always
known
to
the
ancients
as
well
as
ourselves
to
exercise
a
considerable
influence
on
human
character
yet
we
are
unable
to
calculate
what
proportion
this
bears
to
nurture
and
education
but
this
is
the
real
question
we
can
not
pursue
the
mind
into
embryology
we
can
only
trace
how
after
birth
it
begins
to
grow
but
how
much
is
due
to
the
soil
how
much
to
the
original
latent
seed
it
is
impossible
to
distinguish
and
because
we
are
certain
that
heredity
exercises
a
considerable
but
undefined
influence
we
must
not
increase
the
wonder
by
exaggerating
it
the
love
of
system
is
always
tending
to
prevail
over
the
historical
investigation
of
the
mind
which
is
our
chief
means
of
knowing
it
it
equally
tends
to
hinder
the
other
great
source
of
our
knowledge
of
the
mind
the
observation
of
its
workings
and
processes
which
we
can
make
for
ourselves
the
mind
when
studied
through
the
individual
is
apt
to
be
isolated
this
is
due
to
the
very
form
of
the
enquiry
whereas
in
truth
it
is
indistinguishable
from
circumstances
the
very
language
which
it
uses
being
the
result
of
the
instincts
of
generations
and
every
word
which
a
man
utters
being
the
answer
to
some
other
word
spoken
or
suggested
by
somebody
else
iii
the
tendency
of
the
preceding
remarks
has
been
to
show
that
psychology
is
necessarily
a
fragment
and
is
not
and
can
not
be
a
connected
system
we
can
not
define
or
limit
the
mind
but
we
can
describe
it
we
can
collect
information
about
it
we
can
enumerate
the
principal
subjects
which
are
included
in
the
study
of
it
thus
we
are
able
to
rehabilitate
psychology
to
some
extent
not
as
a
branch
of
science
but
as
a
collection
of
facts
bearing
on
human
life
as
a
part
of
the
history
of
philosophy
as
an
aspect
of
metaphysic
it
is
a
fragment
of
a
science
only
which
in
all
probability
can
never
make
any
great
progress
or
attain
to
much
clearness
or
exactness
it
is
however
a
kind
of
knowledge
which
has
a
great
interest
for
us
and
is
always
present
to
us
and
of
which
we
carry
about
the
materials
in
our
own
bosoms
we
can
observe
our
minds
and
we
can
experiment
upon
them
and
the
knowledge
thus
acquired
is
not
easily
forgotten
and
is
a
help
to
us
in
study
as
well
as
in
conduct
the
principal
subjects
of
psychology
may
be
summed
up
as
follows
a
the
relation
of
man
to
the
world
around
him
in
what
sense
and
within
what
limits
can
he
withdraw
from
its
laws
or
assert
himself
against
them
freedom
and
necessity
and
what
is
that
which
we
suppose
to
be
thus
independent
and
which
we
call
ourselves
how
does
the
inward
differ
from
the
outward
and
what
is
the
relation
between
them
and
where
do
we
draw
the
line
by
which
we
separate
mind
from
matter
the
soul
from
the
body
is
the
mind
active
or
passive
or
partly
both
are
its
movements
identical
with
those
of
the
body
or
only
preconcerted
and
coincident
with
them
or
is
one
simply
an
aspect
of
the
other
b
what
are
we
to
think
of
time
and
space
time
seems
to
have
a
nearer
connexion
with
the
mind
space
with
the
body
yet
time
as
well
as
space
is
necessary
to
our
idea
of
either
we
see
also
that
they
have
an
analogy
with
one
another
and
that
in
mathematics
they
often
interpenetrate
space
or
place
has
been
said
by
kant
to
be
the
form
of
the
outward
time
of
the
inward
sense
he
regards
them
as
parts
or
forms
of
the
mind
but
this
is
an
unfortunate
and
inexpressive
way
of
describing
their
relation
to
us
for
of
all
the
phenomena
present
to
the
human
mind
they
seem
to
have
most
the
character
of
objective
existence
there
is
no
use
in
asking
what
is
beyond
or
behind
them
we
can
not
get
rid
of
them
and
to
throw
the
laws
of
external
nature
which
to
us
are
the
type
of
the
immutable
into
the
subjective
side
of
the
antithesis
seems
to
be
equally
inappropriate
when
in
imagination
we
enter
into
the
closet
of
the
mind
and
withdraw
ourselves
from
the
external
world
we
seem
to
find
there
more
or
less
distinct
processes
which
may
be
described
by
the
words
perceive
feel
think
want
wish
like
dislike
fear
know
remember
imagine
dream
act
endeavour
hope
these
processes
would
seem
to
have
the
same
notions
attached
to
them
in
the
minds
of
all
educated
persons
they
are
distinguished
from
one
another
in
thought
but
they
intermingle
it
is
possible
to
reflect
upon
them
or
to
become
conscious
of
them
in
a
greater
or
less
degree
or
with
a
greater
or
less
continuity
or
attention
and
thus
arise
the
intermittent
phenomena
of
consciousness
or
the
use
of
all
of
them
is
possible
to
us
at
all
times
and
therefore
in
any
operation
of
the
mind
the
whole
are
latent
but
we
are
able
to
characterise
them
sufficiently
by
that
part
of
the
complex
action
which
is
the
most
prominent
we
have
no
difficulty
in
distinguishing
an
act
of
sight
or
an
act
of
will
from
an
act
of
thought
although
thought
is
present
in
both
of
them
hence
the
conception
of
different
faculties
or
different
virtues
is
precarious
because
each
of
them
is
passing
into
the
other
and
they
are
all
one
in
the
mind
itself
they
appear
and
reappear
and
may
all
be
regarded
as
the
phases
or
aspects
or
differences
of
the
same
mind
or
person
nearest
the
sense
in
the
scale
of
the
intellectual
faculties
is
memory
which
is
a
mode
rather
than
a
faculty
of
the
mind
and
accompanies
all
mental
operations
there
are
two
principal
kinds
of
it
recollection
and
recognition
recollection
in
which
forgotten
things
are
recalled
or
return
to
the
mind
recognition
in
which
the
mind
finds
itself
again
among
things
once
familiar
the
simplest
way
in
which
we
can
represent
the
former
to
ourselves
is
by
shutting
our
eyes
and
trying
to
recall
in
what
we
term
the
mind
eye
the
picture
of
the
surrounding
scene
or
by
laying
down
the
book
which
we
are
reading
and
recapitulating
what
we
can
remember
of
it
but
many
times
more
powerful
than
recollection
is
recognition
perhaps
because
it
is
more
assisted
by
association
we
have
known
and
forgotten
and
after
a
long
interval
the
thing
which
we
have
seen
once
is
seen
again
by
us
but
with
a
different
feeling
and
comes
back
to
us
not
as
new
knowledge
but
as
a
thing
to
which
we
ourselves
impart
a
notion
already
present
to
us
in
words
we
set
the
stamp
upon
the
wax
every
one
is
aware
of
the
difference
between
the
first
and
second
sight
of
a
place
between
a
scene
clothed
with
associations
or
bare
and
divested
of
them
we
say
to
ourselves
on
revisiting
a
spot
after
a
long
interval
how
many
things
have
happened
since
i
last
saw
this
there
is
probably
no
impression
ever
received
by
us
of
which
we
can
venture
to
say
that
the
vestiges
are
altogether
lost
or
that
we
might
not
under
some
circumstances
recover
it
a
knowledge
may
be
easily
renewed
and
therefore
is
very
different
from
ignorance
of
the
language
learnt
in
childhood
not
a
word
may
be
remembered
and
yet
when
a
new
beginning
is
made
the
old
habit
soon
returns
the
neglected
organs
come
back
into
use
and
the
river
of
speech
finds
out
the
channel
is
the
most
treacherous
word
which
is
employed
in
the
study
of
the
mind
for
it
is
used
in
many
senses
and
has
rarely
if
ever
been
minutely
analyzed
like
memory
it
accompanies
all
mental
operations
but
not
always
continuously
and
it
exists
in
various
degrees
it
may
be
imperceptible
or
hardly
perceptible
it
may
be
the
living
sense
that
our
thoughts
actions
sufferings
are
our
own
it
is
a
kind
of
attention
which
we
pay
to
ourselves
and
is
intermittent
rather
than
continuous
its
sphere
has
been
exaggerated
it
is
sometimes
said
to
assure
us
of
our
freedom
but
this
is
an
illusion
as
there
may
be
a
real
freedom
without
consciousness
of
it
so
there
may
be
a
consciousness
of
freedom
without
the
reality
it
may
be
regarded
as
a
higher
degree
of
knowledge
when
we
not
only
know
but
know
that
we
know
consciousness
is
opposed
to
habit
inattention
sleep
death
it
may
be
illustrated
by
its
derivative
conscience
which
speaks
to
men
not
only
of
right
and
wrong
in
the
abstract
but
of
right
and
wrong
actions
in
reference
to
themselves
and
their
circumstances
association
is
another
of
the
phenomena
of
the
human
mind
we
speak
of
the
laws
of
association
but
this
is
an
expression
which
is
confusing
for
the
phenomenon
itself
is
of
the
most
capricious
and
uncertain
sort
it
may
be
briefly
described
as
follows
the
simplest
case
of
association
is
that
of
sense
when
we
see
or
hear
separately
one
of
two
things
which
we
have
previously
seen
or
heard
together
the
occurrence
of
the
one
has
a
tendency
to
suggest
the
other
so
the
sight
or
name
of
a
house
may
recall
to
our
minds
the
memory
of
those
who
once
lived
there
like
may
recall
like
and
everything
its
opposite
the
parts
of
a
whole
the
terms
of
a
series
objects
lying
near
words
having
a
customary
order
stick
together
in
the
mind
a
word
may
bring
back
a
passage
of
poetry
or
a
whole
system
of
philosophy
from
one
end
of
the
world
or
from
one
pole
of
knowledge
we
may
travel
to
the
other
in
an
indivisible
instant
the
long
train
of
association
by
which
we
pass
from
one
point
to
the
other
involving
every
sort
of
complex
relation
so
sudden
so
accidental
is
one
of
the
greatest
wonders
of
mind
this
process
however
is
not
always
continuous
but
often
intermittent
we
can
think
of
things
in
isolation
as
well
as
in
association
we
do
not
mean
that
they
must
all
hang
from
one
another
we
can
begin
again
after
an
interval
of
rest
or
vacancy
as
a
new
train
of
thought
suddenly
arises
as
for
example
when
we
wake
of
a
morning
or
after
violent
exercise
time
place
the
same
colour
or
sound
or
smell
or
taste
will
often
call
up
some
thought
or
recollection
either
accidentally
or
naturally
associated
with
them
but
it
is
equally
noticeable
that
the
new
thought
may
occur
to
us
we
can
not
tell
how
or
why
by
the
spontaneous
action
of
the
mind
itself
or
by
the
latent
influence
of
the
body
both
science
and
poetry
are
made
up
of
associations
or
recollections
but
we
must
observe
also
that
the
mind
is
not
wholly
dependent
on
them
having
also
the
power
of
origination
there
are
other
processes
of
the
mind
which
it
is
good
for
us
to
study
when
we
are
at
home
and
by
ourselves
the
manner
in
which
thought
passes
into
act
the
conflict
of
passion
and
reason
in
many
stages
the
transition
from
sensuality
to
love
or
sentiment
and
from
earthly
love
to
heavenly
the
slow
and
silent
influence
of
habit
which
little
by
little
changes
the
nature
of
men
the
sudden
change
of
the
old
nature
of
man
into
a
new
one
wrought
by
shame
or
by
some
other
overwhelming
impulse
these
are
the
greater
phenomena
of
mind
and
he
who
has
thought
of
them
for
himself
will
live
and
move
in
a
world
and
will
himself
be
a
man
at
the
other
end
of
the
intellectualis
nearest
not
to
earth
and
sense
but
to
heaven
and
god
is
the
personality
of
man
by
which
he
holds
communion
with
the
unseen
world
somehow
he
knows
not
how
somewhere
he
knows
not
where
under
this
higher
aspect
of
his
being
he
grasps
the
ideas
of
god
freedom
and
immortality
he
sees
the
forms
of
truth
holiness
and
love
and
is
satisfied
with
them
no
account
of
the
mind
can
be
complete
which
does
not
admit
the
reality
or
the
possibility
of
another
life
whether
regarded
as
an
ideal
or
as
a
fact
the
highest
part
of
man
nature
and
that
in
which
it
seems
most
nearly
to
approach
the
divine
is
a
phenomenon
which
exists
and
must
therefore
be
included
within
the
domain
of
psychology
iv
we
admit
that
there
is
no
perfect
or
ideal
psychology
it
is
not
a
whole
in
the
same
sense
in
which
chemistry
physiology
or
mathematics
are
wholes
that
is
to
say
it
is
not
a
connected
unity
of
knowledge
compared
with
the
wealth
of
other
sciences
it
rests
upon
a
small
number
of
facts
and
when
we
go
beyond
these
we
fall
into
conjectures
and
verbal
discussions
the
facts
themselves
are
disjointed
the
causes
of
them
run
up
into
other
sciences
and
we
have
no
means
of
tracing
them
from
one
to
the
other
yet
it
may
be
true
of
this
as
of
other
beginnings
of
knowledge
that
the
attempt
to
put
them
together
has
tested
the
truth
of
them
and
given
a
stimulus
to
the
enquiry
into
them
psychology
should
be
natural
not
technical
it
should
take
the
form
which
is
the
most
intelligible
to
the
common
understanding
because
it
has
to
do
with
common
things
which
are
familiar
to
us
all
it
should
aim
at
no
more
than
every
reflecting
man
knows
or
can
easily
verify
for
himself
when
simple
and
unpretentious
it
is
least
obscured
by
words
least
liable
to
fall
under
the
influence
of
physiology
or
metaphysic
it
should
argue
not
from
exceptional
but
from
ordinary
phenomena
it
should
be
careful
to
distinguish
the
higher
and
the
lower
elements
of
human
nature
and
not
allow
one
to
be
veiled
in
the
disguise
of
the
other
lest
through
the
slippery
nature
of
language
we
should
pass
imperceptibly
from
good
to
evil
from
nature
in
the
higher
to
nature
in
the
neutral
or
lower
sense
it
should
assert
consistently
the
unity
of
the
human
faculties
the
unity
of
knowledge
the
unity
of
god
and
law
the
difference
between
the
will
and
the
affections
and
between
the
reason
and
the
passions
should
also
be
recognized
by
it
its
sphere
is
supposed
to
be
narrowed
to
the
individual
soul
but
it
can
not
be
thus
separated
in
fact
it
goes
back
to
the
beginnings
of
things
to
the
first
growth
of
language
and
philosophy
and
to
the
whole
science
of
man
there
can
be
no
truth
or
completeness
in
any
study
of
the
mind
which
is
confined
to
the
individual
the
nature
of
language
though
not
the
whole
is
perhaps
at
present
the
most
important
element
in
our
knowledge
of
it
it
is
not
impossible
that
some
numerical
laws
may
be
found
to
have
a
place
in
the
relations
of
mind
and
matter
as
in
the
rest
of
nature
the
old
pythagorean
fancy
that
the
soul
or
has
in
it
harmony
may
in
some
degree
be
realized
but
the
indications
of
such
numerical
harmonies
are
faint
either
the
secret
of
them
lies
deeper
than
we
can
discover
or
nature
may
have
rebelled
against
the
use
of
them
in
the
composition
of
men
and
animals
it
is
with
qualitative
rather
than
with
quantitative
differences
that
we
are
concerned
in
psychology
the
facts
relating
to
the
mind
which
we
obtain
from
physiology
are
negative
rather
than
positive
they
show
us
not
the
processes
of
mental
action
but
the
conditions
of
which
when
deprived
the
mind
ceases
to
act
it
would
seem
as
if
the
time
had
not
yet
arrived
when
we
can
hope
to
add
anything
of
much
importance
to
our
knowledge
of
the
mind
from
the
investigations
of
the
microscope
the
elements
of
psychology
can
still
only
be
learnt
from
reflections
on
ourselves
which
interpret
and
are
also
interpreted
by
our
experience
of
others
the
history
of
language
of
philosophy
and
religion
the
great
thoughts
or
inventions
or
discoveries
which
move
mankind
furnish
the
larger
moulds
or
outlines
in
which
the
human
mind
has
been
cast
from
these
the
individual
derives
so
much
as
he
is
able
to
comprehend
or
has
the
opportunity
of
learning
theaetetus
persons
of
the
dialogue
socrates
theodorus
theaetetus
euclid
and
terpsion
meet
in
front
of
euclid
house
in
megara
they
enter
the
house
and
the
dialogue
is
read
to
them
by
a
servant
euclid
have
you
only
just
arrived
from
the
country
terpsion
terpsion
no
i
came
some
time
ago
and
i
have
been
in
the
agora
looking
for
you
and
wondering
that
i
could
not
find
you
euclid
but
i
was
not
in
the
city
terpsion
where
then
euclid
as
i
was
going
down
to
the
harbour
i
met
theaetetus
he
was
being
carried
up
to
athens
from
the
army
at
corinth
terpsion
was
he
alive
or
dead
euclid
he
was
scarcely
alive
for
he
has
been
badly
wounded
but
he
was
suffering
even
more
from
the
sickness
which
has
broken
out
in
the
army
terpsion
the
dysentery
you
mean
euclid
yes
terpsion
alas
what
a
loss
he
will
be
euclid
yes
terpsion
he
is
a
noble
fellow
only
i
heard
some
people
highly
praising
his
behaviour
in
this
very
battle
terpsion
no
wonder
i
should
rather
be
surprised
at
hearing
anything
else
of
him
but
why
did
he
go
on
instead
of
stopping
at
megara
euclid
he
wanted
to
get
home
although
i
entreated
and
advised
him
to
remain
he
would
not
listen
to
me
so
i
set
him
on
his
way
and
turned
back
and
then
i
remembered
what
socrates
had
said
of
him
and
thought
how
remarkably
this
like
all
his
predictions
had
been
fulfilled
i
believe
that
he
had
seen
him
a
little
before
his
own
death
when
theaetetus
was
a
youth
and
he
had
a
memorable
conversation
with
him
which
he
repeated
to
me
when
i
came
to
athens
he
was
full
of
admiration
of
his
genius
and
said
that
he
would
most
certainly
be
a
great
man
if
he
lived
terpsion
the
prophecy
has
certainly
been
fulfilled
but
what
was
the
conversation
can
you
tell
me
euclid
no
indeed
not
offhand
but
i
took
notes
of
it
as
soon
as
i
got
home
these
i
filled
up
from
memory
writing
them
out
at
leisure
and
whenever
i
went
to
athens
i
asked
socrates
about
any
point
which
i
had
forgotten
and
on
my
return
i
made
corrections
thus
i
have
nearly
the
whole
conversation
written
down
terpsion
i
remember
you
told
me
and
i
have
always
been
intending
to
ask
you
to
show
me
the
writing
but
have
put
off
doing
so
and
now
why
should
we
not
read
it
through
having
just
come
from
the
country
i
should
greatly
like
to
rest
euclid
i
too
shall
be
very
glad
of
a
rest
for
i
went
with
theaetetus
as
far
as
erineum
let
us
go
in
then
and
while
we
are
reposing
the
servant
shall
read
to
us
terpsion
very
good
euclid
here
is
the
roll
terpsion
i
may
observe
that
i
have
introduced
socrates
not
as
narrating
to
me
but
as
actually
conversing
with
the
persons
whom
he
mentioned
these
were
theodorus
the
geometrician
of
cyrene
and
theaetetus
i
have
omitted
for
the
sake
of
convenience
the
interlocutory
words
said
remarked
which
he
used
when
he
spoke
of
himself
and
again
agreed
or
in
the
answer
lest
the
repetition
of
them
should
be
troublesome
terpsion
quite
right
euclid
euclid
and
now
boy
you
may
take
the
roll
and
read
euclid
servant
reads
socrates
if
i
cared
enough
about
the
cyrenians
theodorus
i
would
ask
you
whether
there
are
any
rising
geometricians
or
philosophers
in
that
part
of
the
world
but
i
am
more
interested
in
our
own
athenian
youth
and
i
would
rather
know
who
among
them
are
likely
to
do
well
i
observe
them
as
far
as
i
can
myself
and
i
enquire
of
any
one
whom
they
follow
and
i
see
that
a
great
many
of
them
follow
you
in
which
they
are
quite
right
considering
your
eminence
in
geometry
and
in
other
ways
tell
me
then
if
you
have
met
with
any
one
who
is
good
for
anything
theodorus
yes
socrates
i
have
become
acquainted
with
one
very
remarkable
athenian
youth
whom
i
commend
to
you
as
well
worthy
of
your
attention
if
he
had
been
a
beauty
i
should
have
been
afraid
to
praise
him
lest
you
should
suppose
that
i
was
in
love
with
him
but
he
is
no
beauty
and
you
must
not
be
offended
if
i
say
that
he
is
very
like
you
for
he
has
a
snub
nose
and
projecting
eyes
although
these
features
are
less
marked
in
him
than
in
you
seeing
then
that
he
has
no
personal
attractions
i
may
freely
say
that
in
all
my
acquaintance
which
is
very
large
i
never
knew
any
one
who
was
his
equal
in
natural
gifts
for
he
has
a
quickness
of
apprehension
which
is
almost
unrivalled
and
he
is
exceedingly
gentle
and
also
the
most
courageous
of
men
there
is
a
union
of
qualities
in
him
such
as
i
have
never
seen
in
any
other
and
should
scarcely
have
thought
possible
for
those
who
like
him
have
quick
and
ready
and
retentive
wits
have
generally
also
quick
tempers
they
are
ships
without
ballast
and
go
darting
about
and
are
mad
rather
than
courageous
and
the
steadier
sort
when
they
have
to
face
study
prove
stupid
and
can
not
remember
whereas
he
moves
surely
and
smoothly
and
successfully
in
the
path
of
knowledge
and
enquiry
and
he
is
full
of
gentleness
flowing
on
silently
like
a
river
of
oil
at
his
age
it
is
wonderful
socrates
that
is
good
news
whose
son
is
he
theodorus
the
name
of
his
father
i
have
forgotten
but
the
youth
himself
is
the
middle
one
of
those
who
are
approaching
us
he
and
his
companions
have
been
anointing
themselves
in
the
outer
court
and
now
they
seem
to
have
finished
and
are
coming
towards
us
look
and
see
whether
you
know
him
socrates
i
know
the
youth
but
i
do
not
know
his
name
he
is
the
son
of
euphronius
the
sunian
who
was
himself
an
eminent
man
and
such
another
as
his
son
is
according
to
your
account
of
him
i
believe
that
he
left
a
considerable
fortune
theodorus
theaetetus
socrates
is
his
name
but
i
rather
think
that
the
property
disappeared
in
the
hands
of
trustees
notwithstanding
which
he
is
wonderfully
liberal
socrates
he
must
be
a
fine
fellow
tell
him
to
come
and
sit
by
me
theodorus
i
will
come
hither
theaetetus
and
sit
by
socrates
socrates
by
all
means
theaetetus
in
order
that
i
may
see
the
reflection
of
myself
in
your
face
for
theodorus
says
that
we
are
alike
and
yet
if
each
of
us
held
in
his
hands
a
lyre
and
he
said
that
they
were
tuned
alike
should
we
at
once
take
his
word
or
should
we
ask
whether
he
who
said
so
was
or
was
not
a
musician
theaetetus
we
should
ask
socrates
and
if
we
found
that
he
was
we
should
take
his
word
and
if
not
not
theaetetus
true
socrates
and
if
this
supposed
likeness
of
our
faces
is
a
matter
of
any
interest
to
us
we
should
enquire
whether
he
who
says
that
we
are
alike
is
a
painter
or
not
theaetetus
certainly
we
should
socrates
and
is
theodorus
a
painter
theaetetus
i
never
heard
that
he
was
socrates
is
he
a
geometrician
theaetetus
of
course
he
is
socrates
socrates
and
is
he
an
astronomer
and
calculator
and
musician
and
in
general
an
educated
man
theaetetus
i
think
so
socrates
if
then
he
remarks
on
a
similarity
in
our
persons
either
by
way
of
praise
or
blame
there
is
no
particular
reason
why
we
should
attend
to
him
theaetetus
i
should
say
not
socrates
but
if
he
praises
the
virtue
or
wisdom
which
are
the
mental
endowments
of
either
of
us
then
he
who
hears
the
praises
will
naturally
desire
to
examine
him
who
is
praised
and
he
again
should
be
willing
to
exhibit
himself
theaetetus
very
true
socrates
socrates
then
now
is
the
time
my
dear
theaetetus
for
me
to
examine
and
for
you
to
exhibit
since
although
theodorus
has
praised
many
a
citizen
and
stranger
in
my
hearing
never
did
i
hear
him
praise
any
one
as
he
has
been
praising
you
theaetetus
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
socrates
but
what
if
he
was
only
in
jest
socrates
nay
theodorus
is
not
given
to
jesting
and
i
can
not
allow
you
to
retract
your
consent
on
any
such
pretence
as
that
if
you
do
he
will
have
to
swear
to
his
words
and
we
are
perfectly
sure
that
no
one
will
be
found
to
impugn
him
do
not
be
shy
then
but
stand
to
your
word
theaetetus
i
suppose
i
must
if
you
wish
it
socrates
in
the
first
place
i
should
like
to
ask
what
you
learn
of
theodorus
something
of
geometry
perhaps
theaetetus
yes
socrates
and
astronomy
and
harmony
and
calculation
theaetetus
i
do
my
best
socrates
yes
my
boy
and
so
do
i
and
my
desire
is
to
learn
of
him
or
of
anybody
who
seems
to
understand
these
things
and
i
get
on
pretty
well
in
general
but
there
is
a
little
difficulty
which
i
want
you
and
the
company
to
aid
me
in
investigating
will
you
answer
me
a
question
not
learning
growing
wiser
about
that
which
you
learn
theaetetus
of
course
socrates
and
by
wisdom
the
wise
are
wise
theaetetus
yes
socrates
and
is
that
different
in
any
way
from
knowledge
theaetetus
what
socrates
wisdom
are
not
men
wise
in
that
which
they
know
theaetetus
certainly
they
are
socrates
then
wisdom
and
knowledge
are
the
same
theaetetus
yes
socrates
herein
lies
the
difficulty
which
i
can
never
solve
to
my
satisfaction
what
is
knowledge
can
we
answer
that
question
what
say
you
which
of
us
will
speak
first
whoever
misses
shall
sit
down
as
at
a
game
of
ball
and
shall
be
donkey
as
the
boys
say
he
who
lasts
out
his
competitors
in
the
game
without
missing
shall
be
our
king
and
shall
have
the
right
of
putting
to
us
any
questions
which
he
pleases
why
is
there
no
reply
i
hope
theodorus
that
i
am
not
betrayed
into
rudeness
by
my
love
of
conversation
i
only
want
to
make
us
talk
and
be
friendly
and
sociable
theodorus
the
reverse
of
rudeness
socrates
but
i
would
rather
that
you
would
ask
one
of
the
young
fellows
for
the
truth
is
that
i
am
unused
to
your
game
of
question
and
answer
and
i
am
too
old
to
learn
the
young
will
be
more
suitable
and
they
will
improve
more
than
i
shall
for
youth
is
always
able
to
improve
and
so
having
made
a
beginning
with
theaetetus
i
would
advise
you
to
go
on
with
him
and
not
let
him
off
socrates
do
you
hear
theaetetus
what
theodorus
says
the
philosopher
whom
you
would
not
like
to
disobey
and
whose
word
ought
to
be
a
command
to
a
young
man
bids
me
interrogate
you
take
courage
then
and
nobly
say
what
you
think
that
knowledge
is
theaetetus
well
socrates
i
will
answer
as
you
and
he
bid
me
and
if
i
make
a
mistake
you
will
doubtless
correct
me
socrates
we
will
if
we
can
theaetetus
then
i
think
that
the
sciences
which
i
learn
from
theodorus
geometry
and
those
which
you
just
now
mentioned
are
knowledge
and
i
would
include
the
art
of
the
cobbler
and
other
craftsmen
these
each
and
all
of
them
are
knowledge
socrates
too
much
theaetetus
too
much
the
nobility
and
liberality
of
your
nature
make
you
give
many
and
diverse
things
when
i
am
asking
for
one
simple
thing
theaetetus
what
do
you
mean
socrates
socrates
perhaps
nothing
i
will
endeavour
however
to
explain
what
i
believe
to
be
my
meaning
when
you
speak
of
cobbling
you
mean
the
art
or
science
of
making
shoes
theaetetus
just
so
socrates
and
when
you
speak
of
carpentering
you
mean
the
art
of
making
wooden
implements
theaetetus
i
do
socrates
in
both
cases
you
define
the
subject
matter
of
each
of
the
two
arts
theaetetus
true
socrates
but
that
theaetetus
was
not
the
point
of
my
question
we
wanted
to
know
not
the
subjects
nor
yet
the
number
of
the
arts
or
sciences
for
we
were
not
going
to
count
them
but
we
wanted
to
know
the
nature
of
knowledge
in
the
abstract
am
i
not
right
theaetetus
perfectly
right
socrates
let
me
offer
an
illustration
suppose
that
a
person
were
to
ask
about
some
very
trivial
and
obvious
thing
for
example
what
is
clay
and
we
were
to
reply
that
there
is
a
clay
of
potters
there
is
a
clay
of
there
is
a
clay
of
would
not
the
answer
be
ridiculous
theaetetus
truly
socrates
in
the
first
place
there
would
be
an
absurdity
in
assuming
that
he
who
asked
the
question
would
understand
from
our
answer
the
nature
of
merely
because
we
added
the
or
of
any
other
workers
how
can
a
man
understand
the
name
of
anything
when
he
does
not
know
the
nature
of
it
theaetetus
he
can
not
socrates
then
he
who
does
not
know
what
science
or
knowledge
is
has
no
knowledge
of
the
art
or
science
of
making
shoes
theaetetus
none
socrates
nor
of
any
other
science
theaetetus
no
socrates
and
when
a
man
is
asked
what
science
or
knowledge
is
to
give
in
answer
the
name
of
some
art
or
science
is
ridiculous
for
the
question
is
is
knowledge
and
he
replies
knowledge
of
this
or
that
theaetetus
true
socrates
moreover
he
might
answer
shortly
and
simply
but
he
makes
an
enormous
circuit
for
example
when
asked
about
the
clay
he
might
have
said
simply
that
clay
is
moistened
earth
what
sort
of
clay
is
not
to
the
point
theaetetus
yes
socrates
there
is
no
difficulty
as
you
put
the
question
you
mean
if
i
am
not
mistaken
something
like
what
occurred
to
me
and
to
my
friend
here
your
namesake
socrates
in
a
recent
discussion
socrates
what
was
that
theaetetus
theaetetus
theodorus
was
writing
out
for
us
something
about
roots
such
as
the
roots
of
three
or
five
showing
that
they
are
incommensurable
by
the
unit
he
selected
other
examples
up
to
seventeen
there
he
stopped
now
as
there
are
innumerable
roots
the
notion
occurred
to
us
of
attempting
to
include
them
all
under
one
name
or
class
socrates
and
did
you
find
such
a
class
theaetetus
i
think
that
we
did
but
i
should
like
to
have
your
opinion
socrates
let
me
hear
theaetetus
we
divided
all
numbers
into
two
classes
those
which
are
made
up
of
equal
factors
multiplying
into
one
another
which
we
compared
to
square
figures
and
called
square
or
equilateral
numbers
that
was
one
class
socrates
very
good
theaetetus
the
intermediate
numbers
such
as
three
and
five
and
every
other
number
which
is
made
up
of
unequal
factors
either
of
a
greater
multiplied
by
a
less
or
of
a
less
multiplied
by
a
greater
and
when
regarded
as
a
figure
is
contained
in
unequal
sides
all
these
we
compared
to
oblong
figures
and
called
them
oblong
numbers
socrates
capital
and
what
followed
theaetetus
the
lines
or
sides
which
have
for
their
squares
the
equilateral
plane
numbers
were
called
by
us
lengths
or
magnitudes
and
the
lines
which
are
the
roots
of
or
whose
squares
are
equal
to
the
oblong
numbers
were
called
powers
or
roots
the
reason
of
this
latter
name
being
that
they
are
commensurable
with
the
former
with
the
lengths
or
magnitudes
not
in
linear
measurement
but
in
the
value
of
the
superficial
content
of
their
squares
and
the
same
about
solids
socrates
excellent
my
boys
i
think
that
you
fully
justify
the
praises
of
theodorus
and
that
he
will
not
be
found
guilty
of
false
witness
theaetetus
but
i
am
unable
socrates
to
give
you
a
similar
answer
about
knowledge
which
is
what
you
appear
to
want
and
therefore
theodorus
is
a
deceiver
after
all
socrates
well
but
if
some
one
were
to
praise
you
for
running
and
to
say
that
he
never
met
your
equal
among
boys
and
afterwards
you
were
beaten
in
a
race
by
a
man
who
was
a
great
runner
would
the
praise
be
any
the
less
true
theaetetus
certainly
not
socrates
and
is
the
discovery
of
the
nature
of
knowledge
so
small
a
matter
as
just
now
said
is
it
not
one
which
would
task
the
powers
of
men
perfect
in
every
way
theaetetus
by
heaven
they
should
be
the
top
of
all
perfection
socrates
well
then
be
of
good
cheer
do
not
say
that
theodorus
was
mistaken
about
you
but
do
your
best
to
ascertain
the
true
nature
of
knowledge
as
well
as
of
other
things
theaetetus
i
am
eager
enough
socrates
if
that
would
bring
to
light
the
truth
socrates
come
you
made
a
good
beginning
just
now
let
your
own
answer
about
roots
be
your
model
and
as
you
comprehended
them
all
in
one
class
try
and
bring
the
many
sorts
of
knowledge
under
one
definition
theaetetus
i
can
assure
you
socrates
that
i
have
tried
very
often
when
the
report
of
questions
asked
by
you
was
brought
to
me
but
i
can
neither
persuade
myself
that
i
have
a
satisfactory
answer
to
give
nor
hear
of
any
one
who
answers
as
you
would
have
him
and
i
can
not
shake
off
a
feeling
of
anxiety
socrates
these
are
the
pangs
of
labour
my
dear
theaetetus
you
have
something
within
you
which
you
are
bringing
to
the
birth
theaetetus
i
do
not
know
socrates
i
only
say
what
i
feel
socrates
and
have
you
never
heard
simpleton
that
i
am
the
son
of
a
midwife
brave
and
burly
whose
name
was
phaenarete
theaetetus
yes
i
have
socrates
and
that
i
myself
practise
midwifery
theaetetus
no
never
socrates
let
me
tell
you
that
i
do
though
my
friend
but
you
must
not
reveal
the
secret
as
the
world
in
general
have
not
found
me
out
and
therefore
they
only
say
of
me
that
i
am
the
strangest
of
mortals
and
drive
men
to
their
wits
end
did
you
ever
hear
that
too
theaetetus
yes
socrates
shall
i
tell
you
the
reason
theaetetus
by
all
means
socrates
bear
in
mind
the
whole
business
of
the
midwives
and
then
you
will
see
my
meaning
better
no
woman
as
you
are
probably
aware
who
is
still
able
to
conceive
and
bear
attends
other
women
but
only
those
who
are
past
bearing
theaetetus
yes
i
know
socrates
the
reason
of
this
is
said
to
be
that
artemis
the
goddess
of
childbirth
is
not
a
mother
and
she
honours
those
who
are
like
herself
but
she
could
not
allow
the
barren
to
be
midwives
because
human
nature
can
not
know
the
mystery
of
an
art
without
experience
and
therefore
she
assigned
this
office
to
those
who
are
too
old
to
bear
theaetetus
i
dare
say
socrates
and
i
dare
say
too
or
rather
i
am
absolutely
certain
that
the
midwives
know
better
than
others
who
is
pregnant
and
who
is
not
theaetetus
very
true
socrates
and
by
the
use
of
potions
and
incantations
they
are
able
to
arouse
the
pangs
and
to
soothe
them
at
will
they
can
make
those
bear
who
have
a
difficulty
in
bearing
and
if
they
think
fit
they
can
smother
the
embryo
in
the
womb
theaetetus
they
can
socrates
did
you
ever
remark
that
they
are
also
most
cunning
matchmakers
and
have
a
thorough
knowledge
of
what
unions
are
likely
to
produce
a
brave
brood
theaetetus
no
never
socrates
then
let
me
tell
you
that
this
is
their
greatest
pride
more
than
cutting
the
umbilical
cord
and
if
you
reflect
you
will
see
that
the
same
art
which
cultivates
and
gathers
in
the
fruits
of
the
earth
will
be
most
likely
to
know
in
what
soils
the
several
plants
or
seeds
should
be
deposited
theaetetus
yes
the
same
art
socrates
and
do
you
suppose
that
with
women
the
case
is
otherwise
theaetetus
i
should
think
not
socrates
certainly
not
but
midwives
are
respectable
women
who
have
a
character
to
lose
and
they
avoid
this
department
of
their
profession
because
they
are
afraid
of
being
called
procuresses
which
is
a
name
given
to
those
who
join
together
man
and
woman
in
an
unlawful
and
unscientific
way
and
yet
the
true
midwife
is
also
the
true
and
only
matchmaker
theaetetus
clearly
socrates
such
are
the
midwives
whose
task
is
a
very
important
one
but
not
so
important
as
mine
for
women
do
not
bring
into
the
world
at
one
time
real
children
and
at
another
time
counterfeits
which
are
with
difficulty
distinguished
from
them
if
they
did
then
the
discernment
of
the
true
and
false
birth
would
be
the
crowning
achievement
of
the
art
of
midwifery
you
would
think
so
theaetetus
indeed
i
should
socrates
well
my
art
of
midwifery
is
in
most
respects
like
theirs
but
differs
in
that
i
attend
men
and
not
women
and
look
after
their
souls
when
they
are
in
labour
and
not
after
their
bodies
and
the
triumph
of
my
art
is
in
thoroughly
examining
whether
the
thought
which
the
mind
of
the
young
man
brings
forth
is
a
false
idol
or
a
noble
and
true
birth
and
like
the
midwives
i
am
barren
and
the
reproach
which
is
often
made
against
me
that
i
ask
questions
of
others
and
have
not
the
wit
to
answer
them
myself
is
very
just
the
reason
is
that
the
god
compels
me
to
be
a
midwife
but
does
not
allow
me
to
bring
forth
and
therefore
i
am
not
myself
at
all
wise
nor
have
i
anything
to
show
which
is
the
invention
or
birth
of
my
own
soul
but
those
who
converse
with
me
profit
some
of
them
appear
dull
enough
at
first
but
afterwards
as
our
acquaintance
ripens
if
the
god
is
gracious
to
them
they
all
make
astonishing
progress
and
this
in
the
opinion
of
others
as
well
as
in
their
own
it
is
quite
clear
that
they
never
learned
anything
from
me
the
many
fine
discoveries
to
which
they
cling
are
of
their
own
making
but
to
me
and
the
god
they
owe
their
delivery
and
the
proof
of
my
words
is
that
many
of
them
in
their
ignorance
either
in
their
despising
me
or
falling
under
the
influence
of
others
have
gone
away
too
soon
and
have
not
only
lost
the
children
of
whom
i
had
previously
delivered
them
by
an
ill
bringing
up
but
have
stifled
whatever
else
they
had
in
them
by
evil
communications
being
fonder
of
lies
and
shams
than
of
the
truth
and
they
have
at
last
ended
by
seeing
themselves
as
others
see
them
to
be
great
fools
aristeides
the
son
of
lysimachus
is
one
of
them
and
there
are
many
others
the
truants
often
return
to
me
and
beg
that
i
would
consort
with
them
again
they
are
ready
to
go
to
me
on
their
knees
and
then
if
my
familiar
allows
which
is
not
always
the
case
i
receive
them
and
they
begin
to
grow
again
dire
are
the
pangs
which
my
art
is
able
to
arouse
and
to
allay
in
those
who
consort
with
me
just
like
the
pangs
of
women
in
childbirth
night
and
day
they
are
full
of
perplexity
and
travail
which
is
even
worse
than
that
of
the
women
so
much
for
them
and
there
are
others
theaetetus
who
come
to
me
apparently
having
nothing
in
them
and
as
i
know
that
they
have
no
need
of
my
art
i
coax
them
into
marrying
some
one
and
by
the
grace
of
god
i
can
generally
tell
who
is
likely
to
do
them
good
many
of
them
i
have
given
away
to
prodicus
and
many
to
other
inspired
sages
i
tell
you
this
long
story
friend
theaetetus
because
i
suspect
as
indeed
you
seem
to
think
yourself
that
you
are
in
labour
great
with
some
conception
come
then
to
me
who
am
a
midwife
son
and
myself
a
midwife
and
do
your
best
to
answer
the
questions
which
i
will
ask
you
and
if
i
abstract
and
expose
your
because
i
discover
upon
inspection
that
the
conception
which
you
have
formed
is
a
vain
shadow
do
not
quarrel
with
me
on
that
account
as
the
manner
of
women
is
when
their
first
children
are
taken
from
them
for
i
have
actually
known
some
who
were
ready
to
bite
me
when
i
deprived
them
of
a
darling
folly
they
did
not
perceive
that
i
acted
from
goodwill
not
knowing
that
no
god
is
the
enemy
of
man
that
was
not
within
the
range
of
their
ideas
neither
am
i
their
enemy
in
all
this
but
it
would
be
wrong
for
me
to
admit
falsehood
or
to
stifle
the
truth
once
more
then
theaetetus
i
repeat
my
old
question
is
knowledge
and
do
not
say
that
you
can
not
tell
but
quit
yourself
like
a
man
and
by
the
help
of
god
you
will
be
able
to
tell
theaetetus
at
any
rate
socrates
after
such
an
exhortation
i
should
be
ashamed
of
not
trying
to
do
my
best
now
he
who
knows
perceives
what
he
knows
and
as
far
as
i
can
see
at
present
knowledge
is
perception
socrates
bravely
said
boy
that
is
the
way
in
which
you
should
express
your
opinion
and
now
let
us
examine
together
this
conception
of
yours
and
see
whether
it
is
a
true
birth
or
a
mere
you
say
that
knowledge
is
perception
theaetetus
yes
socrates
well
you
have
delivered
yourself
of
a
very
important
doctrine
about
knowledge
it
is
indeed
the
opinion
of
protagoras
who
has
another
way
of
expressing
it
man
he
says
is
the
measure
of
all
things
of
the
existence
of
things
that
are
and
of
the
of
things
that
are
not
you
have
read
him
theaetetus
o
yes
again
and
again
socrates
does
he
not
say
that
things
are
to
you
such
as
they
appear
to
you
and
to
me
such
as
they
appear
to
me
and
that
you
and
i
are
men
theaetetus
yes
he
says
so
socrates
a
wise
man
is
not
likely
to
talk
nonsense
let
us
try
to
understand
him
the
same
wind
is
blowing
and
yet
one
of
us
may
be
cold
and
the
other
not
or
one
may
be
slightly
and
the
other
very
cold
theaetetus
quite
true
socrates
now
is
the
wind
regarded
not
in
relation
to
us
but
absolutely
cold
or
not
or
are
we
to
say
with
protagoras
that
the
wind
is
cold
to
him
who
is
cold
and
not
to
him
who
is
not
theaetetus
i
suppose
the
last
socrates
then
it
must
appear
so
to
each
of
them
theaetetus
yes
socrates
and
to
him
means
the
same
as
perceives
theaetetus
true
socrates
then
appearing
and
perceiving
coincide
in
the
case
of
hot
and
cold
and
in
similar
instances
for
things
appear
or
may
be
supposed
to
be
to
each
one
such
as
he
perceives
them
theaetetus
yes
socrates
then
perception
is
always
of
existence
and
being
the
same
as
knowledge
is
unerring
theaetetus
clearly
socrates
in
the
name
of
the
graces
what
an
almighty
wise
man
protagoras
must
have
been
he
spoke
these
things
in
a
parable
to
the
common
herd
like
you
and
me
but
told
the
truth
truth
in
allusion
to
a
book
of
protagoras
which
bore
this
title
in
secret
to
his
own
disciples
theaetetus
what
do
you
mean
socrates
socrates
i
am
about
to
speak
of
a
high
argument
in
which
all
things
are
said
to
be
relative
you
can
not
rightly
call
anything
by
any
name
such
as
great
or
small
heavy
or
light
for
the
great
will
be
small
and
the
heavy
light
there
is
no
single
thing
or
quality
but
out
of
motion
and
change
and
admixture
all
things
are
becoming
relatively
to
one
another
which
is
by
us
incorrectly
called
being
but
is
really
becoming
for
nothing
ever
is
but
all
things
are
becoming
summon
all
philosophers
protagoras
heracleitus
empedocles
and
the
rest
of
them
one
after
another
and
with
the
exception
of
parmenides
they
will
agree
with
you
in
this
summon
the
great
masters
of
either
kind
of
poetry
epicharmus
the
prince
of
comedy
and
homer
of
tragedy
when
the
latter
sings
of
whence
sprang
the
gods
and
mother
tethys
does
he
not
mean
that
all
things
are
the
offspring
of
flux
and
motion
theaetetus
i
think
so
socrates
and
who
could
take
up
arms
against
such
a
great
army
having
homer
for
its
general
and
not
appear
ridiculous
compare
cratylus
theaetetus
who
indeed
socrates
socrates
yes
theaetetus
and
there
are
plenty
of
other
proofs
which
will
show
that
motion
is
the
source
of
what
is
called
being
and
becoming
and
inactivity
of
and
destruction
for
fire
and
warmth
which
are
supposed
to
be
the
parent
and
guardian
of
all
other
things
are
born
of
movement
and
of
friction
which
is
a
kind
of
motion
is
not
this
the
origin
of
fire
theaetetus
it
is
socrates
and
the
race
of
animals
is
generated
in
the
same
way
theaetetus
certainly
socrates
and
is
not
the
bodily
habit
spoiled
by
rest
and
idleness
but
preserved
for
a
long
time
by
motion
and
exercise
theaetetus
true
socrates
and
what
of
the
mental
habit
is
not
the
soul
informed
and
improved
and
preserved
by
study
and
attention
which
are
motions
but
when
at
rest
which
in
the
soul
only
means
want
of
attention
and
study
is
uninformed
and
speedily
forgets
whatever
she
has
learned
theaetetus
true
socrates
then
motion
is
a
good
and
rest
an
evil
to
the
soul
as
well
as
to
the
body
theaetetus
clearly
socrates
i
may
add
that
breathless
calm
stillness
and
the
like
waste
and
impair
while
wind
and
storm
preserve
and
the
palmary
argument
of
all
which
i
strongly
urge
is
the
golden
chain
in
homer
by
which
he
means
the
sun
thereby
indicating
that
so
long
as
the
sun
and
the
heavens
go
round
in
their
orbits
all
things
human
and
divine
are
and
are
preserved
but
if
they
were
chained
up
and
their
motions
ceased
then
all
things
would
be
destroyed
and
as
the
saying
is
turned
upside
down
theaetetus
i
believe
socrates
that
you
have
truly
explained
his
meaning
socrates
then
now
apply
his
doctrine
to
perception
my
good
friend
and
first
of
all
to
vision
that
which
you
call
white
colour
is
not
in
your
eyes
and
is
not
a
distinct
thing
which
exists
out
of
them
and
you
must
not
assign
any
place
to
it
for
if
it
had
position
it
would
be
and
be
at
rest
and
there
would
be
no
process
of
becoming
theaetetus
then
what
is
colour
socrates
let
us
carry
the
principle
which
has
just
been
affirmed
that
nothing
is
and
then
we
shall
see
that
white
black
and
every
other
colour
arises
out
of
the
eye
meeting
the
appropriate
motion
and
that
what
we
call
a
colour
is
in
each
case
neither
the
active
nor
the
passive
element
but
something
which
passes
between
them
and
is
peculiar
to
each
percipient
are
you
quite
certain
that
the
several
colours
appear
to
a
dog
or
to
any
animal
whatever
as
they
appear
to
you
theaetetus
far
from
it
socrates
or
that
anything
appears
the
same
to
you
as
to
another
man
are
you
so
profoundly
convinced
of
this
rather
would
it
not
be
true
that
it
never
appears
exactly
the
same
to
you
because
you
are
never
exactly
the
same
theaetetus
the
latter
socrates
and
if
that
with
which
i
compare
myself
in
size
or
which
i
apprehend
by
touch
were
great
or
white
or
hot
it
could
not
become
different
by
mere
contact
with
another
unless
it
actually
changed
nor
again
if
the
comparing
or
apprehending
subject
were
great
or
white
or
hot
could
this
when
unchanged
from
within
become
changed
by
any
approximation
or
affection
of
any
other
thing
the
fact
is
that
in
our
ordinary
way
of
speaking
we
allow
ourselves
to
be
driven
into
most
ridiculous
and
wonderful
contradictions
as
protagoras
and
all
who
take
his
line
of
argument
would
remark
theaetetus
how
and
of
what
sort
do
you
mean
socrates
a
little
instance
will
sufficiently
explain
my
meaning
here
are
six
dice
which
are
more
by
a
half
when
compared
with
four
and
fewer
by
a
half
than
twelve
they
are
more
and
also
fewer
how
can
you
or
any
one
maintain
the
contrary
theaetetus
very
true
socrates
well
then
suppose
that
protagoras
or
some
one
asks
whether
anything
can
become
greater
or
more
if
not
by
increasing
how
would
you
answer
him
theaetetus
theaetetus
i
should
say
socrates
if
i
were
to
speak
my
mind
in
reference
to
this
last
question
and
if
i
were
not
afraid
of
contradicting
my
former
answer
socrates
capital
excellent
spoken
like
an
oracle
my
boy
and
if
you
reply
there
will
be
a
case
for
euripides
for
our
tongue
will
be
unconvinced
but
not
our
mind
in
allusion
to
the
line
of
euripides
hippol
e
gloss
omomoch
e
de
thren
anomotos
theaetetus
very
true
socrates
the
thoroughbred
sophists
who
know
all
that
can
be
known
about
the
mind
and
argue
only
out
of
the
superfluity
of
their
wits
would
have
had
a
regular
over
this
and
would
have
knocked
their
arguments
together
finely
but
you
and
i
who
have
no
professional
aims
only
desire
to
see
what
is
the
mutual
relation
of
these
principles
whether
they
are
consistent
with
each
or
not
theaetetus
yes
that
would
be
my
desire
socrates
and
mine
too
but
since
this
is
our
feeling
and
there
is
plenty
of
time
why
should
we
not
calmly
and
patiently
review
our
own
thoughts
and
thoroughly
examine
and
see
what
these
appearances
in
us
really
are
if
i
am
not
mistaken
they
will
be
described
by
us
as
follows
first
that
nothing
can
become
greater
or
less
either
in
number
or
magnitude
while
remaining
equal
to
itself
you
would
agree
theaetetus
yes
socrates
secondly
that
without
addition
or
subtraction
there
is
no
increase
or
diminution
of
anything
but
only
equality
theaetetus
quite
true
socrates
thirdly
that
what
was
not
before
can
not
be
afterwards
without
becoming
and
having
become
theaetetus
yes
truly
socrates
these
three
axioms
if
i
am
not
mistaken
are
fighting
with
one
another
in
our
minds
in
the
case
of
the
dice
or
again
in
such
a
case
as
this
if
i
were
to
say
that
i
who
am
of
a
certain
height
and
taller
than
you
may
within
a
year
without
gaining
or
losing
in
height
be
not
so
tall
not
that
i
should
have
lost
but
that
you
would
have
increased
in
such
a
case
i
am
afterwards
what
i
once
was
not
and
yet
i
have
not
become
for
i
could
not
have
become
without
becoming
neither
could
i
have
become
less
without
losing
somewhat
of
my
height
and
i
could
give
you
ten
thousand
examples
of
similar
contradictions
if
we
admit
them
at
all
i
believe
that
you
follow
me
theaetetus
for
i
suspect
that
you
have
thought
of
these
questions
before
now
theaetetus
yes
socrates
and
i
am
amazed
when
i
think
of
them
by
the
gods
i
am
and
i
want
to
know
what
on
earth
they
mean
and
there
are
times
when
my
head
quite
swims
with
the
contemplation
of
them
socrates
i
see
my
dear
theaetetus
that
theodorus
had
a
true
insight
into
your
nature
when
he
said
that
you
were
a
philosopher
for
wonder
is
the
feeling
of
a
philosopher
and
philosophy
begins
in
wonder
he
was
not
a
bad
genealogist
who
said
that
iris
the
messenger
of
heaven
is
the
child
of
thaumas
wonder
but
do
you
begin
to
see
what
is
the
explanation
of
this
perplexity
on
the
hypothesis
which
we
attribute
to
protagoras
theaetetus
not
as
yet
socrates
then
you
will
be
obliged
to
me
if
i
help
you
to
unearth
the
hidden
of
a
famous
man
or
school
theaetetus
to
be
sure
i
shall
be
very
much
obliged
socrates
take
a
look
round
then
and
see
that
none
of
the
uninitiated
are
listening
now
by
the
uninitiated
i
mean
the
people
who
believe
in
nothing
but
what
they
can
grasp
in
their
hands
and
who
will
not
allow
that
action
or
generation
or
anything
invisible
can
have
real
existence
theaetetus
yes
indeed
socrates
they
are
very
hard
and
impenetrable
mortals
socrates
yes
my
boy
outer
barbarians
far
more
ingenious
are
the
brethren
whose
mysteries
i
am
about
to
reveal
to
you
their
first
principle
is
that
all
is
motion
and
upon
this
all
the
affections
of
which
we
were
just
now
speaking
are
supposed
to
depend
there
is
nothing
but
motion
which
has
two
forms
one
active
and
the
other
passive
both
in
endless
number
and
out
of
the
union
and
friction
of
them
there
is
generated
a
progeny
endless
in
number
having
two
forms
sense
and
the
object
of
sense
which
are
ever
breaking
forth
and
coming
to
the
birth
at
the
same
moment
the
senses
are
variously
named
hearing
seeing
smelling
there
is
the
sense
of
heat
cold
pleasure
pain
desire
fear
and
many
more
which
have
names
as
well
as
innumerable
others
which
are
without
them
each
has
its
kindred
object
each
variety
of
colour
has
a
corresponding
variety
of
sight
and
so
with
sound
and
hearing
and
with
the
rest
of
the
senses
and
the
objects
akin
to
them
do
you
see
theaetetus
the
bearings
of
this
tale
on
the
preceding
argument
theaetetus
indeed
i
do
not
socrates
then
attend
and
i
will
try
to
finish
the
story
the
purport
is
that
all
these
things
are
in
motion
as
i
was
saying
and
that
this
motion
is
of
two
kinds
a
slower
and
a
quicker
and
the
slower
elements
have
their
motions
in
the
same
place
and
with
reference
to
things
near
them
and
so
they
beget
but
what
is
begotten
is
swifter
for
it
is
carried
to
fro
and
moves
from
place
to
place
apply
this
to
sense
when
the
eye
and
the
appropriate
object
meet
together
and
give
birth
to
whiteness
and
the
sensation
connatural
with
it
which
could
not
have
been
given
by
either
of
them
going
elsewhere
then
while
the
sight
is
flowing
from
the
eye
whiteness
proceeds
from
the
object
which
combines
in
producing
the
colour
and
so
the
eye
is
fulfilled
with
sight
and
really
sees
and
becomes
not
sight
but
a
seeing
eye
and
the
object
which
combined
to
form
the
colour
is
fulfilled
with
whiteness
and
becomes
not
whiteness
but
a
white
thing
whether
wood
or
stone
or
whatever
the
object
may
be
which
happens
to
be
coloured
white
and
this
is
true
of
all
sensible
objects
hard
warm
and
the
like
which
are
similarly
to
be
regarded
as
i
was
saying
before
not
as
having
any
absolute
existence
but
as
being
all
of
them
of
whatever
kind
generated
by
motion
in
their
intercourse
with
one
another
for
of
the
agent
and
patient
as
existing
in
separation
no
trustworthy
conception
as
they
say
can
be
formed
for
the
agent
has
no
existence
until
united
with
the
patient
and
the
patient
has
no
existence
until
united
with
the
agent
and
that
which
by
uniting
with
something
becomes
an
agent
by
meeting
with
some
other
thing
is
converted
into
a
patient
and
from
all
these
considerations
as
i
said
at
first
there
arises
a
general
reflection
that
there
is
no
one
thing
but
everything
is
becoming
and
in
relation
and
being
must
be
altogether
abolished
although
from
habit
and
ignorance
we
are
compelled
even
in
this
discussion
to
retain
the
use
of
the
term
but
great
philosophers
tell
us
that
we
are
not
to
allow
either
the
word
or
to
something
or
me
or
or
or
any
other
detaining
name
to
be
used
in
the
language
of
nature
all
things
are
being
created
and
destroyed
coming
into
being
and
passing
into
new
forms
nor
can
any
name
fix
or
detain
them
he
who
attempts
to
fix
them
is
easily
refuted
and
this
should
be
the
way
of
speaking
not
only
of
particulars
but
of
aggregates
such
aggregates
as
are
expressed
in
the
word
or
or
any
name
of
an
animal
or
of
a
class
o
theaetetus
are
not
these
speculations
sweet
as
honey
and
do
you
not
like
the
taste
of
them
in
the
mouth
theaetetus
i
do
not
know
what
to
say
socrates
for
indeed
i
can
not
make
out
whether
you
are
giving
your
own
opinion
or
only
wanting
to
draw
me
out
socrates
you
forget
my
friend
that
i
neither
know
nor
profess
to
know
anything
of
these
matters
you
are
the
person
who
is
in
labour
i
am
the
barren
midwife
and
this
is
why
i
soothe
you
and
offer
you
one
good
thing
after
another
that
you
may
taste
them
and
i
hope
that
i
may
at
last
help
to
bring
your
own
opinion
into
the
light
of
day
when
this
has
been
accomplished
then
we
will
determine
whether
what
you
have
brought
forth
is
only
a
or
a
real
and
genuine
birth
therefore
keep
up
your
spirits
and
answer
like
a
man
what
you
think
theaetetus
ask
me
socrates
then
once
more
is
it
your
opinion
that
nothing
is
but
what
becomes
the
good
and
the
noble
as
well
as
all
the
other
things
which
we
were
just
now
mentioning
theaetetus
when
i
hear
you
discoursing
in
this
style
i
think
that
there
is
a
great
deal
in
what
you
say
and
i
am
very
ready
to
assent
socrates
let
us
not
leave
the
argument
unfinished
then
for
there
still
remains
to
be
considered
an
objection
which
may
be
raised
about
dreams
and
diseases
in
particular
about
madness
and
the
various
illusions
of
hearing
and
sight
or
of
other
senses
for
you
know
that
in
all
these
cases
the
theory
appears
to
be
unmistakably
refuted
since
in
dreams
and
illusions
we
certainly
have
false
perceptions
and
far
from
saying
that
everything
is
which
appears
we
should
rather
say
that
nothing
is
which
appears
theaetetus
very
true
socrates
socrates
but
then
my
boy
how
can
any
one
contend
that
knowledge
is
perception
or
that
to
every
man
what
appears
is
theaetetus
i
am
afraid
to
say
socrates
that
i
have
nothing
to
answer
because
you
rebuked
me
just
now
for
making
this
excuse
but
i
certainly
can
not
undertake
to
argue
that
madmen
or
dreamers
think
truly
when
they
imagine
some
of
them
that
they
are
gods
and
others
that
they
can
fly
and
are
flying
in
their
sleep
socrates
do
you
see
another
question
which
can
be
raised
about
these
phenomena
notably
about
dreaming
and
waking
theaetetus
what
question
socrates
a
question
which
i
think
that
you
must
often
have
heard
persons
ask
how
can
you
determine
whether
at
this
moment
we
are
sleeping
and
all
our
thoughts
are
a
dream
or
whether
we
are
awake
and
talking
to
one
another
in
the
waking
state
theaetetus
indeed
socrates
i
do
not
know
how
to
prove
the
one
any
more
than
the
other
for
in
both
cases
the
facts
precisely
correspond
and
there
is
no
difficulty
in
supposing
that
during
all
this
discussion
we
have
been
talking
to
one
another
in
a
dream
and
when
in
a
dream
we
seem
to
be
narrating
dreams
the
resemblance
of
the
two
states
is
quite
astonishing
socrates
you
see
then
that
a
doubt
about
the
reality
of
sense
is
easily
raised
since
there
may
even
be
a
doubt
whether
we
are
awake
or
in
a
dream
and
as
our
time
is
equally
divided
between
sleeping
and
waking
in
either
sphere
of
existence
the
soul
contends
that
the
thoughts
which
are
present
to
our
minds
at
the
time
are
true
and
during
one
half
of
our
lives
we
affirm
the
truth
of
the
one
and
during
the
other
half
of
the
other
and
are
equally
confident
of
both
theaetetus
most
true
socrates
and
may
not
the
same
be
said
of
madness
and
other
disorders
the
difference
is
only
that
the
times
are
not
equal
theaetetus
certainly
socrates
and
is
truth
or
falsehood
to
be
determined
by
duration
of
time
theaetetus
that
would
be
in
many
ways
ridiculous
socrates
but
can
you
certainly
determine
by
any
other
means
which
of
these
opinions
is
true
theaetetus
i
do
not
think
that
i
can
socrates
listen
then
to
a
statement
of
the
other
side
of
the
argument
which
is
made
by
the
champions
of
appearance
they
would
say
as
i
imagine
can
that
which
is
wholly
other
than
something
have
the
same
quality
as
that
from
which
it
differs
and
observe
theaetetus
that
the
word
means
not
but
other
theaetetus
certainly
putting
the
question
as
you
do
that
which
is
wholly
other
can
not
either
potentially
or
in
any
other
way
be
the
same
socrates
and
must
therefore
be
admitted
to
be
unlike
theaetetus
true
socrates
if
then
anything
happens
to
become
like
or
unlike
itself
or
another
when
it
becomes
like
we
call
it
the
same
when
unlike
other
theaetetus
certainly
socrates
were
we
not
saying
that
there
are
agents
many
and
infinite
and
patients
many
and
infinite
theaetetus
yes
socrates
and
also
that
different
combinations
will
produce
results
which
are
not
the
same
but
different
theaetetus
certainly
socrates
let
us
take
you
and
me
or
anything
as
an
example
there
is
socrates
in
health
and
socrates
sick
are
they
like
or
unlike
theaetetus
you
mean
to
compare
socrates
in
health
as
a
whole
and
socrates
in
sickness
as
a
whole
socrates
exactly
that
is
my
meaning
theaetetus
i
answer
they
are
unlike
socrates
and
if
unlike
they
are
other
theaetetus
certainly
socrates
and
would
you
not
say
the
same
of
socrates
sleeping
and
waking
or
in
any
of
the
states
which
we
were
mentioning
theaetetus
i
should
socrates
all
agents
have
a
different
patient
in
socrates
accordingly
as
he
is
well
or
theaetetus
of
course
socrates
and
i
who
am
the
patient
and
that
which
is
the
agent
will
produce
something
different
in
each
of
the
two
cases
theaetetus
certainly
socrates
the
wine
which
i
drink
when
i
am
in
health
appears
sweet
and
pleasant
to
me
theaetetus
true
socrates
for
as
has
been
already
acknowledged
the
patient
and
agent
meet
together
and
produce
sweetness
and
a
perception
of
sweetness
which
are
in
simultaneous
motion
and
the
perception
which
comes
from
the
patient
makes
the
tongue
percipient
and
the
quality
of
sweetness
which
arises
out
of
and
is
moving
about
the
wine
makes
the
wine
both
to
be
and
to
appear
sweet
to
the
healthy
tongue
theaetetus
certainly
that
has
been
already
acknowledged
socrates
but
when
i
am
sick
the
wine
really
acts
upon
another
and
a
different
person
theaetetus
yes
socrates
the
combination
of
the
draught
of
wine
and
the
socrates
who
is
sick
produces
quite
another
result
which
is
the
sensation
of
bitterness
in
the
tongue
and
the
motion
and
creation
of
bitterness
in
and
about
the
wine
which
becomes
not
bitterness
but
something
bitter
as
i
myself
become
not
perception
but
percipient
theaetetus
true
socrates
there
is
no
other
object
of
which
i
shall
ever
have
the
same
perception
for
another
object
would
give
another
perception
and
would
make
the
percipient
other
and
different
nor
can
that
object
which
affects
me
meeting
another
subject
produce
the
same
or
become
similar
for
that
too
would
produce
another
result
from
another
subject
and
become
different
theaetetus
true
socrates
neither
can
i
by
myself
have
this
sensation
nor
the
object
by
itself
this
quality
theaetetus
certainly
not
socrates
when
i
perceive
i
must
become
percipient
of
something
there
can
be
no
such
thing
as
perceiving
and
perceiving
nothing
the
object
whether
it
become
sweet
bitter
or
of
any
other
quality
must
have
relation
to
a
percipient
nothing
can
become
sweet
which
is
sweet
to
no
one
theaetetus
certainly
not
socrates
then
the
inference
is
that
we
the
agent
and
patient
are
or
become
in
relation
to
one
another
there
is
a
law
which
binds
us
one
to
the
other
but
not
to
any
other
existence
nor
each
of
us
to
himself
and
therefore
we
can
only
be
bound
to
one
another
so
that
whether
a
person
says
that
a
thing
is
or
becomes
he
must
say
that
it
is
or
becomes
to
or
of
or
in
relation
to
something
else
but
he
must
not
say
or
allow
any
one
else
to
say
that
anything
is
or
becomes
absolutely
such
is
our
conclusion
theaetetus
very
true
socrates
socrates
then
if
that
which
acts
upon
me
has
relation
to
me
and
to
no
other
i
and
no
other
am
the
percipient
of
it
theaetetus
of
course
socrates
then
my
perception
is
true
to
me
being
inseparable
from
my
own
being
and
as
protagoras
says
to
myself
i
am
judge
of
what
is
and
what
is
not
to
me
theaetetus
i
suppose
so
socrates
how
then
if
i
never
err
and
if
my
mind
never
trips
in
the
conception
of
being
or
becoming
can
i
fail
of
knowing
that
which
i
perceive
theaetetus
you
can
not
socrates
then
you
were
quite
right
in
affirming
that
knowledge
is
only
perception
and
the
meaning
turns
out
to
be
the
same
whether
with
homer
and
heracleitus
and
all
that
company
you
say
that
all
is
motion
and
flux
or
with
the
great
sage
protagoras
that
man
is
the
measure
of
all
things
or
with
theaetetus
that
given
these
premises
perception
is
knowledge
am
i
not
right
theaetetus
and
is
not
this
your
child
of
which
i
have
delivered
you
what
say
you
theaetetus
i
can
not
but
agree
socrates
socrates
then
this
is
the
child
however
he
may
turn
out
which
you
and
i
have
with
difficulty
brought
into
the
world
and
now
that
he
is
born
we
must
run
round
the
hearth
with
him
and
see
whether
he
is
worth
rearing
or
is
only
a
and
a
sham
is
he
to
be
reared
in
any
case
and
not
exposed
or
will
you
bear
to
see
him
rejected
and
not
get
into
a
passion
if
i
take
away
your
theodorus
theaetetus
will
not
be
angry
for
he
is
very
but
tell
me
socrates
in
heaven
name
is
this
after
all
not
the
truth
socrates
you
theodorus
are
a
lover
of
theories
and
now
you
innocently
fancy
that
i
am
a
bag
full
of
them
and
can
easily
pull
one
out
which
will
overthrow
its
predecessor
but
you
do
not
see
that
in
reality
none
of
these
theories
come
from
me
they
all
come
from
him
who
talks
with
me
i
only
know
just
enough
to
extract
them
from
the
wisdom
of
another
and
to
receive
them
in
a
spirit
of
fairness
and
now
i
shall
say
nothing
myself
but
shall
endeavour
to
elicit
something
from
our
young
friend
theodorus
do
as
you
say
socrates
you
are
quite
right
socrates
shall
i
tell
you
theodorus
what
amazes
me
in
your
acquaintance
protagoras
theodorus
what
is
it
socrates
i
am
charmed
with
his
doctrine
that
what
appears
is
to
each
one
but
i
wonder
that
he
did
not
begin
his
book
on
truth
with
a
declaration
that
a
pig
or
a
baboon
or
some
other
yet
stranger
monster
which
has
sensation
is
the
measure
of
all
things
then
he
might
have
shown
a
magnificent
contempt
for
our
opinion
of
him
by
informing
us
at
the
outset
that
while
we
were
reverencing
him
like
a
god
for
his
wisdom
he
was
no
better
than
a
tadpole
not
to
speak
of
his
would
not
this
have
produced
an
overpowering
effect
for
if
truth
is
only
sensation
and
no
man
can
discern
another
feelings
better
than
he
or
has
any
superior
right
to
determine
whether
his
opinion
is
true
or
false
but
each
as
we
have
several
times
repeated
is
to
himself
the
sole
judge
and
everything
that
he
judges
is
true
and
right
why
my
friend
should
protagoras
be
preferred
to
the
place
of
wisdom
and
instruction
and
deserve
to
be
well
paid
and
we
poor
ignoramuses
have
to
go
to
him
if
each
one
is
the
measure
of
his
own
wisdom
must
he
not
be
talking
captandum
in
all
this
i
say
nothing
of
the
ridiculous
predicament
in
which
my
own
midwifery
and
the
whole
art
of
dialectic
is
placed
for
the
attempt
to
supervise
or
refute
the
notions
or
opinions
of
others
would
be
a
tedious
and
enormous
piece
of
folly
if
to
each
man
his
own
are
right
and
this
must
be
the
case
if
protagoras
truth
is
the
real
truth
and
the
philosopher
is
not
merely
amusing
himself
by
giving
oracles
out
of
the
shrine
of
his
book
theodorus
he
was
a
friend
of
mine
socrates
as
you
were
saying
and
therefore
i
can
not
have
him
refuted
by
my
lips
nor
can
i
oppose
you
when
i
agree
with
you
please
then
to
take
theaetetus
again
he
seemed
to
answer
very
nicely
socrates
if
you
were
to
go
into
a
lacedaemonian
palestra
theodorus
would
you
have
a
right
to
look
on
at
the
naked
wrestlers
some
of
them
making
a
poor
figure
if
you
did
not
strip
and
give
them
an
opportunity
of
judging
of
your
own
person
theodorus
why
not
socrates
if
they
would
allow
me
as
i
think
you
will
in
consideration
of
my
age
and
stiffness
let
some
more
supple
youth
try
a
fall
with
you
and
do
not
drag
me
into
the
gymnasium
socrates
your
will
is
my
will
theodorus
as
the
proverbial
philosophers
say
and
therefore
i
will
return
to
the
sage
theaetetus
tell
me
theaetetus
in
reference
to
what
i
was
saying
are
you
not
lost
in
wonder
like
myself
when
you
find
that
all
of
a
sudden
you
are
raised
to
the
level
of
the
wisest
of
men
or
indeed
of
the
gods
for
you
would
assume
the
measure
of
protagoras
to
apply
to
the
gods
as
well
as
men
theaetetus
certainly
i
should
and
i
confess
to
you
that
i
am
lost
in
wonder
at
first
hearing
i
was
quite
satisfied
with
the
doctrine
that
whatever
appears
is
to
each
one
but
now
the
face
of
things
has
changed
socrates
why
my
dear
boy
you
are
young
and
therefore
your
ear
is
quickly
caught
and
your
mind
influenced
by
popular
arguments
protagoras
or
some
one
speaking
on
his
behalf
will
doubtless
say
in
reply
good
people
young
and
old
you
meet
and
harangue
and
bring
in
the
gods
whose
existence
or
i
banish
from
writing
and
speech
or
you
talk
about
the
reason
of
man
being
degraded
to
the
level
of
the
brutes
which
is
a
telling
argument
with
the
multitude
but
not
one
word
of
proof
or
demonstration
do
you
offer
all
is
probability
with
you
and
yet
surely
you
and
theodorus
had
better
reflect
whether
you
are
disposed
to
admit
of
probability
and
figures
of
speech
in
matters
of
such
importance
he
or
any
other
mathematician
who
argued
from
probabilities
and
likelihoods
in
geometry
would
not
be
worth
an
ace
theaetetus
but
neither
you
nor
we
socrates
would
be
satisfied
with
such
arguments
socrates
then
you
and
theodorus
mean
to
say
that
we
must
look
at
the
matter
in
some
other
way
theaetetus
yes
in
quite
another
way
socrates
and
the
way
will
be
to
ask
whether
perception
is
or
is
not
the
same
as
knowledge
for
this
was
the
real
point
of
our
argument
and
with
a
view
to
this
we
raised
did
we
not
those
many
strange
questions
theaetetus
certainly
socrates
shall
we
say
that
we
know
every
thing
which
we
see
and
hear
for
example
shall
we
say
that
not
having
learned
we
do
not
hear
the
language
of
foreigners
when
they
speak
to
us
or
shall
we
say
that
we
not
only
hear
but
know
what
they
are
saying
or
again
if
we
see
letters
which
we
do
not
understand
shall
we
say
that
we
do
not
see
them
or
shall
we
aver
that
seeing
them
we
must
know
them
theaetetus
we
shall
say
socrates
that
we
know
what
we
actually
see
and
hear
of
them
that
is
to
say
we
see
and
know
the
figure
and
colour
of
the
letters
and
we
hear
and
know
the
elevation
or
depression
of
the
sound
of
them
but
we
do
not
perceive
by
sight
and
hearing
or
know
that
which
grammarians
and
interpreters
teach
about
them
socrates
capital
theaetetus
and
about
this
there
shall
be
no
dispute
because
i
want
you
to
grow
but
there
is
another
difficulty
coming
which
you
will
also
have
to
repulse
theaetetus
what
is
it
socrates
some
one
will
say
can
a
man
who
has
ever
known
anything
and
still
has
and
preserves
a
memory
of
that
which
he
knows
not
know
that
which
he
remembers
at
the
time
when
he
remembers
i
have
i
fear
a
tedious
way
of
putting
a
simple
question
which
is
only
whether
a
man
who
has
learned
and
remembers
can
fail
to
know
theaetetus
impossible
socrates
the
supposition
is
monstrous
socrates
am
i
talking
nonsense
then
think
is
not
seeing
perceiving
and
is
not
sight
perception
theaetetus
true
socrates
and
if
our
recent
definition
holds
every
man
knows
that
which
he
has
seen
theaetetus
yes
socrates
and
you
would
admit
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
memory
theaetetus
yes
socrates
and
is
memory
of
something
or
of
nothing
theaetetus
of
something
surely
socrates
of
things
learned
and
perceived
that
is
theaetetus
certainly
socrates
often
a
man
remembers
that
which
he
has
seen
theaetetus
true
socrates
and
if
he
closed
his
eyes
would
he
forget
theaetetus
who
socrates
would
dare
to
say
so
socrates
but
we
must
say
so
if
the
previous
argument
is
to
be
maintained
theaetetus
what
do
you
mean
i
am
not
quite
sure
that
i
understand
you
though
i
have
a
strong
suspicion
that
you
are
right
socrates
as
thus
he
who
sees
knows
as
we
say
that
which
he
sees
for
perception
and
sight
and
knowledge
are
admitted
to
be
the
same
theaetetus
certainly
socrates
but
he
who
saw
and
has
knowledge
of
that
which
he
saw
remembers
when
he
closes
his
eyes
that
which
he
no
longer
sees
theaetetus
true
socrates
and
seeing
is
knowing
and
therefore
is
theaetetus
very
true
socrates
then
the
inference
is
that
a
man
may
have
attained
the
knowledge
of
something
which
he
may
remember
and
yet
not
know
because
he
does
not
see
and
this
has
been
affirmed
by
us
to
be
a
monstrous
supposition
theaetetus
most
true
socrates
thus
then
the
assertion
that
knowledge
and
perception
are
one
involves
a
manifest
impossibility
theaetetus
yes
socrates
then
they
must
be
distinguished
theaetetus
i
suppose
that
they
must
socrates
once
more
we
shall
have
to
begin
and
ask
is
knowledge
and
yet
theaetetus
what
are
we
going
to
do
theaetetus
about
what
socrates
like
a
cock
without
having
won
the
victory
we
walk
away
from
the
argument
and
crow
theaetetus
how
do
you
mean
socrates
after
the
manner
of
disputers
lys
phaedo
republic
we
were
satisfied
with
mere
verbal
consistency
and
were
well
pleased
if
in
this
way
we
could
gain
an
advantage
although
professing
not
to
be
mere
eristics
but
philosophers
i
suspect
that
we
have
unconsciously
fallen
into
the
error
of
that
ingenious
class
of
persons
theaetetus
i
do
not
as
yet
understand
you
socrates
then
i
will
try
to
explain
myself
just
now
we
asked
the
question
whether
a
man
who
had
learned
and
remembered
could
fail
to
know
and
we
showed
that
a
person
who
had
seen
might
remember
when
he
had
his
eyes
shut
and
could
not
see
and
then
he
would
at
the
same
time
remember
and
not
know
but
this
was
an
impossibility
and
so
the
protagorean
fable
came
to
nought
and
yours
also
who
maintained
that
knowledge
is
the
same
as
perception
theaetetus
true
socrates
and
yet
my
friend
i
rather
suspect
that
the
result
would
have
been
different
if
protagoras
who
was
the
father
of
the
first
of
the
two
brats
had
been
alive
he
would
have
had
a
great
deal
to
say
on
their
behalf
but
he
is
dead
and
we
insult
over
his
orphan
child
and
even
the
guardians
whom
he
left
and
of
whom
our
friend
theodorus
is
one
are
unwilling
to
give
any
help
and
therefore
i
suppose
that
i
must
take
up
his
cause
myself
and
see
justice
done
theodorus
not
i
socrates
but
rather
callias
the
son
of
hipponicus
is
guardian
of
his
orphans
i
was
too
soon
diverted
from
the
abstractions
of
dialectic
to
geometry
nevertheless
i
shall
be
grateful
to
you
if
you
assist
him
socrates
very
good
theodorus
you
shall
see
how
i
will
come
to
the
rescue
if
a
person
does
not
attend
to
the
meaning
of
terms
as
they
are
commonly
used
in
argument
he
may
be
involved
even
in
greater
paradoxes
than
these
shall
i
explain
this
matter
to
you
or
to
theaetetus
theodorus
to
both
of
us
and
let
the
younger
answer
he
will
incur
less
disgrace
if
he
is
discomfited
socrates
then
now
let
me
ask
the
awful
question
which
is
this
can
a
man
know
and
also
not
know
that
which
he
knows
theodorus
how
shall
we
answer
theaetetus
theaetetus
he
can
not
i
should
say
socrates
he
can
if
you
maintain
that
seeing
is
knowing
when
you
are
imprisoned
in
a
well
as
the
saying
is
and
the
adversary
closes
one
of
your
eyes
with
his
hand
and
asks
whether
you
can
see
his
cloak
with
the
eye
which
he
has
closed
how
will
you
answer
the
inevitable
man
theaetetus
i
should
answer
with
that
eye
but
with
the
other
socrates
then
you
see
and
do
not
see
the
same
thing
at
the
same
time
theaetetus
yes
in
a
certain
sense
socrates
none
of
that
he
will
reply
i
do
not
ask
or
bid
you
answer
in
what
sense
you
know
but
only
whether
you
know
that
which
you
do
not
know
you
have
been
proved
to
see
that
which
you
do
not
see
and
you
have
already
admitted
that
seeing
is
knowing
and
that
is
i
leave
you
to
draw
the
inference
theaetetus
yes
the
inference
is
the
contradictory
of
my
assertion
socrates
yes
my
marvel
and
there
might
have
been
yet
worse
things
in
store
for
you
if
an
opponent
had
gone
on
to
ask
whether
you
can
have
a
sharp
and
also
a
dull
knowledge
and
whether
you
can
know
near
but
not
at
a
distance
or
know
the
same
thing
with
more
or
less
intensity
and
so
on
without
end
such
questions
might
have
been
put
to
you
by
a
mercenary
who
argued
for
pay
he
would
have
lain
in
wait
for
you
and
when
you
took
up
the
position
that
sense
is
knowledge
he
would
have
made
an
assault
upon
hearing
smelling
and
the
other
senses
he
would
have
shown
you
no
mercy
and
while
you
were
lost
in
envy
and
admiration
of
his
wisdom
he
would
have
got
you
into
his
net
out
of
which
you
would
not
have
escaped
until
you
had
come
to
an
understanding
about
the
sum
to
be
paid
for
your
release
well
you
ask
and
how
will
protagoras
reinforce
his
position
shall
i
answer
for
him
theaetetus
by
all
means
socrates
he
will
repeat
all
those
things
which
we
have
been
urging
on
his
behalf
and
then
he
will
close
with
us
in
disdain
and
say
the
worthy
socrates
asked
a
little
boy
whether
the
same
man
could
remember
and
not
know
the
same
thing
and
the
boy
said
no
because
he
was
frightened
and
could
not
see
what
was
coming
and
then
socrates
made
fun
of
poor
me
the
truth
is
o
slatternly
socrates
that
when
you
ask
questions
about
any
assertion
of
mine
and
the
person
asked
is
found
tripping
if
he
has
answered
as
i
should
have
answered
then
i
am
refuted
but
if
he
answers
something
else
then
he
is
refuted
and
not
i
for
do
you
really
suppose
that
any
one
would
admit
the
memory
which
a
man
has
of
an
impression
which
has
passed
away
to
be
the
same
with
that
which
he
experienced
at
the
time
assuredly
not
or
would
he
hesitate
to
acknowledge
that
the
same
man
may
know
and
not
know
the
same
thing
or
if
he
is
afraid
of
making
this
admission
would
he
ever
grant
that
one
who
has
become
unlike
is
the
same
as
before
he
became
unlike
or
would
he
admit
that
a
man
is
one
at
all
and
not
rather
many
and
infinite
as
the
changes
which
take
place
in
him
i
speak
by
the
card
in
order
to
avoid
entanglements
of
words
but
o
my
good
sir
he
will
say
come
to
the
argument
in
a
more
generous
spirit
and
either
show
if
you
can
that
our
sensations
are
not
relative
and
individual
or
if
you
admit
them
to
be
so
prove
that
this
does
not
involve
the
consequence
that
the
appearance
becomes
or
if
you
will
have
the
word
is
to
the
individual
only
as
to
your
talk
about
pigs
and
baboons
you
are
yourself
behaving
like
a
pig
and
you
teach
your
hearers
to
make
sport
of
my
writings
in
the
same
ignorant
manner
but
this
is
not
to
your
credit
for
i
declare
that
the
truth
is
as
i
have
written
and
that
each
of
us
is
a
measure
of
existence
and
of
yet
one
man
may
be
a
thousand
times
better
than
another
in
proportion
as
different
things
are
and
appear
to
him
and
i
am
far
from
saying
that
wisdom
and
the
wise
man
have
no
existence
but
i
say
that
the
wise
man
is
he
who
makes
the
evils
which
appear
and
are
to
a
man
into
goods
which
are
and
appear
to
him
and
i
would
beg
you
not
to
press
my
words
in
the
letter
but
to
take
the
meaning
of
them
as
i
will
explain
them
remember
what
has
been
already
said
that
to
the
sick
man
his
food
appears
to
be
and
is
bitter
and
to
the
man
in
health
the
opposite
of
bitter
now
i
can
not
conceive
that
one
of
these
men
can
be
or
ought
to
be
made
wiser
than
the
other
nor
can
you
assert
that
the
sick
man
because
he
has
one
impression
is
foolish
and
the
healthy
man
because
he
has
another
is
wise
but
the
one
state
requires
to
be
changed
into
the
other
the
worse
into
the
better
as
in
education
a
change
of
state
has
to
be
effected
and
the
sophist
accomplishes
by
words
the
change
which
the
physician
works
by
the
aid
of
drugs
not
that
any
one
ever
made
another
think
truly
who
previously
thought
falsely
for
no
one
can
think
what
is
not
or
think
anything
different
from
that
which
he
feels
and
this
is
always
true
but
as
the
inferior
habit
of
mind
has
thoughts
of
kindred
nature
so
i
conceive
that
a
good
mind
causes
men
to
have
good
thoughts
and
these
which
the
inexperienced
call
true
i
maintain
to
be
only
better
and
not
truer
than
others
and
o
my
dear
socrates
i
do
not
call
wise
men
tadpoles
far
from
it
i
say
that
they
are
the
physicians
of
the
human
body
and
the
husbandmen
of
plants
for
the
husbandmen
also
take
away
the
evil
and
disordered
sensations
of
plants
and
infuse
into
them
good
and
healthy
sensations
aye
and
true
ones
and
the
wise
and
good
rhetoricians
make
the
good
instead
of
the
evil
to
seem
just
to
states
for
whatever
appears
to
a
state
to
be
just
and
fair
so
long
as
it
is
regarded
as
such
is
just
and
fair
to
it
but
the
teacher
of
wisdom
causes
the
good
to
take
the
place
of
the
evil
both
in
appearance
and
in
reality
and
in
like
manner
the
sophist
who
is
able
to
train
his
pupils
in
this
spirit
is
a
wise
man
and
deserves
to
be
well
paid
by
them
and
so
one
man
is
wiser
than
another
and
no
one
thinks
falsely
and
you
whether
you
will
or
not
must
endure
to
be
a
measure
on
these
foundations
the
argument
stands
firm
which
you
socrates
may
if
you
please
overthrow
by
an
opposite
argument
or
if
you
like
you
may
put
questions
to
me
a
method
to
which
no
intelligent
person
will
object
quite
the
reverse
but
i
must
beg
you
to
put
fair
questions
for
there
is
great
inconsistency
in
saying
that
you
have
a
zeal
for
virtue
and
then
always
behaving
unfairly
in
argument
the
unfairness
of
which
i
complain
is
that
you
do
not
distinguish
between
mere
disputation
and
dialectic
the
disputer
may
trip
up
his
opponent
as
often
as
he
likes
and
make
fun
but
the
dialectician
will
be
in
earnest
and
only
correct
his
adversary
when
necessary
telling
him
the
errors
into
which
he
has
fallen
through
his
own
fault
or
that
of
the
company
which
he
has
previously
kept
if
you
do
so
your
adversary
will
lay
the
blame
of
his
own
confusion
and
perplexity
on
himself
and
not
on
you
he
will
follow
and
love
you
and
will
hate
himself
and
escape
from
himself
into
philosophy
in
order
that
he
may
become
different
from
what
he
was
but
the
other
mode
of
arguing
which
is
practised
by
the
many
will
have
just
the
opposite
effect
upon
him
and
as
he
grows
older
instead
of
turning
philosopher
he
will
come
to
hate
philosophy
i
would
recommend
you
therefore
as
i
said
before
not
to
encourage
yourself
in
this
polemical
and
controversial
temper
but
to
find
out
in
a
friendly
and
congenial
spirit
what
we
really
mean
when
we
say
that
all
things
are
in
motion
and
that
to
every
individual
and
state
what
appears
is
in
this
manner
you
will
consider
whether
knowledge
and
sensation
are
the
same
or
different
but
you
will
not
argue
as
you
were
just
now
doing
from
the
customary
use
of
names
and
words
which
the
vulgar
pervert
in
all
sorts
of
ways
causing
infinite
perplexity
to
one
another
such
theodorus
is
the
very
slight
help
which
i
am
able
to
offer
to
your
old
friend
had
he
been
living
he
would
have
helped
himself
in
a
far
more
gloriose
style
theodorus
you
are
jesting
socrates
indeed
your
defence
of
him
has
been
most
valorous
socrates
thank
you
friend
and
i
hope
that
you
observed
protagoras
bidding
us
be
serious
as
the
text
is
the
measure
of
all
things
was
a
solemn
one
and
he
reproached
us
with
making
a
boy
the
medium
of
discourse
and
said
that
the
boy
timidity
was
made
to
tell
against
his
argument
he
also
declared
that
we
made
a
joke
of
him
theodorus
how
could
i
fail
to
observe
all
that
socrates
socrates
well
and
shall
we
do
as
he
says
theodorus
by
all
means
socrates
but
if
his
wishes
are
to
be
regarded
you
and
i
must
take
up
the
argument
and
in
all
seriousness
and
ask
and
answer
one
another
for
you
see
that
the
rest
of
us
are
nothing
but
boys
in
no
other
way
can
we
escape
the
imputation
that
in
our
fresh
analysis
of
his
thesis
we
are
making
fun
with
boys
theodorus
well
but
is
not
theaetetus
better
able
to
follow
a
philosophical
enquiry
than
a
great
many
men
who
have
long
beards
socrates
yes
theodorus
but
not
better
than
you
and
therefore
please
not
to
imagine
that
i
am
to
defend
by
every
means
in
my
power
your
departed
friend
and
that
you
are
to
defend
nothing
and
nobody
at
any
rate
my
good
man
do
not
sheer
off
until
we
know
whether
you
are
a
true
measure
of
diagrams
or
whether
all
men
are
equally
measures
and
sufficient
for
themselves
in
astronomy
and
geometry
and
the
other
branches
of
knowledge
in
which
you
are
supposed
to
excel
them
theodorus
he
who
is
sitting
by
you
socrates
will
not
easily
avoid
being
drawn
into
an
argument
and
when
i
said
just
now
that
you
would
excuse
me
and
not
like
the
lacedaemonians
compel
me
to
strip
and
fight
i
was
talking
nonsense
i
should
rather
compare
you
to
scirrhon
who
threw
travellers
from
the
rocks
for
the
lacedaemonian
rule
is
or
depart
but
you
seem
to
go
about
your
work
more
after
the
fashion
of
antaeus
you
will
not
allow
any
one
who
approaches
you
to
depart
until
you
have
stripped
him
and
he
has
been
compelled
to
try
a
fall
with
you
in
argument
socrates
there
theodorus
you
have
hit
off
precisely
the
nature
of
my
complaint
but
i
am
even
more
pugnacious
than
the
giants
of
old
for
i
have
met
with
no
end
of
heroes
many
a
heracles
many
a
theseus
mighty
in
words
has
broken
my
head
nevertheless
i
am
always
at
this
rough
exercise
which
inspires
me
like
a
passion
please
then
to
try
a
fall
with
me
whereby
you
will
do
yourself
good
as
well
as
me
theodorus
i
consent
lead
me
whither
you
will
for
i
know
that
you
are
like
destiny
no
man
can
escape
from
any
argument
which
you
may
weave
for
him
but
i
am
not
disposed
to
go
further
than
you
suggest
socrates
once
will
be
enough
and
now
take
particular
care
that
we
do
not
again
unwittingly
expose
ourselves
to
the
reproach
of
talking
childishly
theodorus
i
will
do
my
best
to
avoid
that
error
socrates
in
the
first
place
let
us
return
to
our
old
objection
and
see
whether
we
were
right
in
blaming
and
taking
offence
at
protagoras
on
the
ground
that
he
assumed
all
to
be
equal
and
sufficient
in
wisdom
although
he
admitted
that
there
was
a
better
and
worse
and
that
in
respect
of
this
some
who
as
he
said
were
the
wise
excelled
others
theodorus
very
true
socrates
had
protagoras
been
living
and
answered
for
himself
instead
of
our
answering
for
him
there
would
have
been
no
need
of
our
reviewing
or
reinforcing
the
argument
but
as
he
is
not
here
and
some
one
may
accuse
us
of
speaking
without
authority
on
his
behalf
had
we
not
better
come
to
a
clearer
agreement
about
his
meaning
for
a
great
deal
may
be
at
stake
theodorus
true
socrates
then
let
us
obtain
not
through
any
third
person
but
from
his
own
statement
and
in
the
fewest
words
possible
the
basis
of
agreement
theodorus
in
what
way
socrates
in
this
way
his
words
are
seems
to
a
man
is
to
him
theodorus
yes
so
he
says
socrates
and
are
not
we
protagoras
uttering
the
opinion
of
man
or
rather
of
all
mankind
when
we
say
that
every
one
thinks
himself
wiser
than
other
men
in
some
things
and
their
inferior
in
others
in
the
hour
of
danger
when
they
are
in
perils
of
war
or
of
the
sea
or
of
sickness
do
they
not
look
up
to
their
commanders
as
if
they
were
gods
and
expect
salvation
from
them
only
because
they
excel
them
in
knowledge
is
not
the
world
full
of
men
in
their
several
employments
who
are
looking
for
teachers
and
rulers
of
themselves
and
of
the
animals
and
there
are
plenty
who
think
that
they
are
able
to
teach
and
able
to
rule
now
in
all
this
is
implied
that
ignorance
and
wisdom
exist
among
them
at
least
in
their
own
opinion
theodorus
certainly
socrates
and
wisdom
is
assumed
by
them
to
be
true
thought
and
ignorance
to
be
false
opinion
theodorus
exactly
socrates
how
then
protagoras
would
you
have
us
treat
the
argument
shall
we
say
that
the
opinions
of
men
are
always
true
or
sometimes
true
and
sometimes
false
in
either
case
the
result
is
the
same
and
their
opinions
are
not
always
true
but
sometimes
true
and
sometimes
false
for
tell
me
theodorus
do
you
suppose
that
you
yourself
or
any
other
follower
of
protagoras
would
contend
that
no
one
deems
another
ignorant
or
mistaken
in
his
opinion
theodorus
the
thing
is
incredible
socrates
socrates
and
yet
that
absurdity
is
necessarily
involved
in
the
thesis
which
declares
man
to
be
the
measure
of
all
things
theodorus
how
so
socrates
why
suppose
that
you
determine
in
your
own
mind
something
to
be
true
and
declare
your
opinion
to
me
let
us
assume
as
he
argues
that
this
is
true
to
you
now
if
so
you
must
either
say
that
the
rest
of
us
are
not
the
judges
of
this
opinion
or
judgment
of
yours
or
that
we
judge
you
always
to
have
a
true
opinion
but
are
there
not
thousands
upon
thousands
who
whenever
you
form
a
judgment
take
up
arms
against
you
and
are
of
an
opposite
judgment
and
opinion
deeming
that
you
judge
falsely
theodorus
yes
indeed
socrates
thousands
and
tens
of
thousands
as
homer
says
who
give
me
a
world
of
trouble
socrates
well
but
are
we
to
assert
that
what
you
think
is
true
to
you
and
false
to
the
ten
thousand
others
theodorus
no
other
inference
seems
to
be
possible
socrates
and
how
about
protagoras
himself
if
neither
he
nor
the
multitude
thought
as
indeed
they
do
not
think
that
man
is
the
measure
of
all
things
must
it
not
follow
that
the
truth
of
which
protagoras
wrote
would
be
true
to
no
one
but
if
you
suppose
that
he
himself
thought
this
and
that
the
multitude
does
not
agree
with
him
you
must
begin
by
allowing
that
in
whatever
proportion
the
many
are
more
than
one
in
that
proportion
his
truth
is
more
untrue
than
true
theodorus
that
would
follow
if
the
truth
is
supposed
to
vary
with
individual
opinion
socrates
and
the
best
of
the
joke
is
that
he
acknowledges
the
truth
of
their
opinion
who
believe
his
own
opinion
to
be
false
for
he
admits
that
the
opinions
of
all
men
are
true
theodorus
certainly
socrates
and
does
he
not
allow
that
his
own
opinion
is
false
if
he
admits
that
the
opinion
of
those
who
think
him
false
is
true
theodorus
of
course
socrates
whereas
the
other
side
do
not
admit
that
they
speak
falsely
theodorus
they
do
not
socrates
and
he
as
may
be
inferred
from
his
writings
agrees
that
this
opinion
is
also
true
theodorus
clearly
socrates
then
all
mankind
beginning
with
protagoras
will
contend
or
rather
i
should
say
that
he
will
allow
when
he
concedes
that
his
adversary
has
a
true
opinion
protagoras
i
say
will
himself
allow
that
neither
a
dog
nor
any
ordinary
man
is
the
measure
of
anything
which
he
has
not
learned
am
i
not
right
theodorus
yes
socrates
and
the
truth
of
protagoras
being
doubted
by
all
will
be
true
neither
to
himself
to
any
one
else
theodorus
i
think
socrates
that
we
are
running
my
old
friend
too
hard
socrates
but
i
do
not
know
that
we
are
going
beyond
the
truth
doubtless
as
he
is
older
he
may
be
expected
to
be
wiser
than
we
are
and
if
he
could
only
just
get
his
head
out
of
the
world
below
he
would
have
overthrown
both
of
us
again
and
again
me
for
talking
nonsense
and
you
for
assenting
to
me
and
have
been
off
and
underground
in
a
trice
but
as
he
is
not
within
call
we
must
make
the
best
use
of
our
own
faculties
such
as
they
are
and
speak
out
what
appears
to
us
to
be
true
and
one
thing
which
no
one
will
deny
is
that
there
are
great
differences
in
the
understandings
of
men
theodorus
in
that
opinion
i
quite
agree
socrates
and
is
there
not
most
likely
to
be
firm
ground
in
the
distinction
which
we
were
indicating
on
behalf
of
protagoras
viz
that
most
things
and
all
immediate
sensations
such
as
hot
dry
sweet
are
only
such
as
they
appear
if
however
difference
of
opinion
is
to
be
allowed
at
all
surely
we
must
allow
it
in
respect
of
health
or
disease
for
every
woman
child
or
living
creature
has
not
such
a
knowledge
of
what
conduces
to
health
as
to
enable
them
to
cure
themselves
theodorus
i
quite
agree
socrates
or
again
in
politics
while
affirming
that
just
and
unjust
honourable
and
disgraceful
holy
and
unholy
are
in
reality
to
each
state
such
as
the
state
thinks
and
makes
lawful
and
that
in
determining
these
matters
no
individual
or
state
is
wiser
than
another
still
the
followers
of
protagoras
will
not
deny
that
in
determining
what
is
or
is
not
expedient
for
the
community
one
state
is
wiser
and
one
counsellor
better
than
another
they
will
scarcely
venture
to
maintain
that
what
a
city
enacts
in
the
belief
that
it
is
expedient
will
always
be
really
expedient
but
in
the
other
case
i
mean
when
they
speak
of
justice
and
injustice
piety
and
impiety
they
are
confident
that
in
nature
these
have
no
existence
or
essence
of
their
own
the
truth
is
that
which
is
agreed
on
at
the
time
of
the
agreement
and
as
long
as
the
agreement
lasts
and
this
is
the
philosophy
of
many
who
do
not
altogether
go
along
with
protagoras
here
arises
a
new
question
theodorus
which
threatens
to
be
more
serious
than
the
last
theodorus
well
socrates
we
have
plenty
of
leisure
socrates
that
is
true
and
your
remark
recalls
to
my
mind
an
observation
which
i
have
often
made
that
those
who
have
passed
their
days
in
the
pursuit
of
philosophy
are
ridiculously
at
fault
when
they
have
to
appear
and
speak
in
court
how
natural
is
this
theodorus
what
do
you
mean
socrates
i
mean
to
say
that
those
who
have
been
trained
in
philosophy
and
liberal
pursuits
are
as
unlike
those
who
from
their
youth
upwards
have
been
knocking
about
in
the
courts
and
such
places
as
a
freeman
is
in
breeding
unlike
a
slave
theodorus
in
what
is
the
difference
seen
socrates
in
the
leisure
spoken
of
by
you
which
a
freeman
can
always
command
he
has
his
talk
out
in
peace
and
like
ourselves
he
wanders
at
will
from
one
subject
to
another
and
from
a
second
to
a
third
if
the
fancy
takes
him
he
begins
again
as
we
are
doing
now
caring
not
whether
his
words
are
many
or
few
his
only
aim
is
to
attain
the
truth
but
the
lawyer
is
always
in
a
hurry
there
is
the
water
of
the
clepsydra
driving
him
on
and
not
allowing
him
to
expatiate
at
will
and
there
is
his
adversary
standing
over
him
enforcing
his
rights
the
indictment
which
in
their
phraseology
is
termed
the
affidavit
is
recited
at
the
time
and
from
this
he
must
not
deviate
he
is
a
servant
and
is
continually
disputing
about
a
before
his
master
who
is
seated
and
has
the
cause
in
his
hands
the
trial
is
never
about
some
indifferent
matter
but
always
concerns
himself
and
often
the
race
is
for
his
life
the
consequence
has
been
that
he
has
become
keen
and
shrewd
he
has
learned
how
to
flatter
his
master
in
word
and
indulge
him
in
deed
but
his
soul
is
small
and
unrighteous
his
condition
which
has
been
that
of
a
slave
from
his
youth
upwards
has
deprived
him
of
growth
and
uprightness
and
independence
dangers
and
fears
which
were
too
much
for
his
truth
and
honesty
came
upon
him
in
early
years
when
the
tenderness
of
youth
was
unequal
to
them
and
he
has
been
driven
into
crooked
ways
from
the
first
he
has
practised
deception
and
retaliation
and
has
become
stunted
and
warped
and
so
he
has
passed
out
of
youth
into
manhood
having
no
soundness
in
him
and
is
now
as
he
thinks
a
master
in
wisdom
such
is
the
lawyer
theodorus
will
you
have
the
companion
picture
of
the
philosopher
who
is
of
our
brotherhood
or
shall
we
return
to
the
argument
do
not
let
us
abuse
the
freedom
of
digression
which
we
claim
theodorus
nay
socrates
not
until
we
have
finished
what
we
are
about
for
you
truly
said
that
we
belong
to
a
brotherhood
which
is
free
and
are
not
the
servants
of
the
argument
but
the
argument
is
our
servant
and
must
wait
our
leisure
who
is
our
judge
or
where
is
the
spectator
having
any
right
to
censure
or
control
us
as
he
might
the
poets
socrates
then
as
this
is
your
wish
i
will
describe
the
leaders
for
there
is
no
use
in
talking
about
the
inferior
sort
in
the
first
place
the
lords
of
philosophy
have
never
from
their
youth
upwards
known
their
way
to
the
agora
or
the
dicastery
or
the
council
or
any
other
political
assembly
they
neither
see
nor
hear
the
laws
or
decrees
as
they
are
called
of
the
state
written
or
recited
the
eagerness
of
political
societies
in
the
attainment
of
offices
clubs
and
banquets
and
revels
and
do
not
enter
even
into
their
dreams
whether
any
event
has
turned
out
well
or
ill
in
the
city
what
disgrace
may
have
descended
to
any
one
from
his
ancestors
male
or
female
are
matters
of
which
the
philosopher
no
more
knows
than
he
can
tell
as
they
say
how
many
pints
are
contained
in
the
ocean
neither
is
he
conscious
of
his
ignorance
for
he
does
not
hold
aloof
in
order
that
he
may
gain
a
reputation
but
the
truth
is
that
the
outer
form
of
him
only
is
in
the
city
his
mind
disdaining
the
littlenesses
and
nothingnesses
of
human
things
is
all
abroad
as
pindar
says
measuring
earth
and
heaven
and
the
things
which
are
under
and
on
the
earth
and
above
the
heaven
interrogating
the
whole
nature
of
each
and
all
in
their
entirety
but
not
condescending
to
anything
which
is
within
reach
theodorus
what
do
you
mean
socrates
socrates
i
will
illustrate
my
meaning
theodorus
by
the
jest
which
the
clever
witty
thracian
handmaid
is
said
to
have
made
about
thales
when
he
fell
into
a
well
as
he
was
looking
up
at
the
stars
she
said
that
he
was
so
eager
to
know
what
was
going
on
in
heaven
that
he
could
not
see
what
was
before
his
feet
this
is
a
jest
which
is
equally
applicable
to
all
philosophers
for
the
philosopher
is
wholly
unacquainted
with
his
neighbour
he
is
ignorant
not
only
of
what
he
is
doing
but
he
hardly
knows
whether
he
is
a
man
or
an
animal
he
is
searching
into
the
essence
of
man
and
busy
in
enquiring
what
belongs
to
such
a
nature
to
do
or
suffer
different
from
any
other
i
think
that
you
understand
me
theodorus
theodorus
i
do
and
what
you
say
is
true
socrates
and
thus
my
friend
on
every
occasion
private
as
well
as
public
as
i
said
at
first
when
he
appears
in
a
or
in
any
place
in
which
he
has
to
speak
of
things
which
are
at
his
feet
and
before
his
eyes
he
is
the
jest
not
only
of
thracian
handmaids
but
of
the
general
herd
tumbling
into
wells
and
every
sort
of
disaster
through
his
inexperience
his
awkwardness
is
fearful
and
gives
the
impression
of
imbecility
when
he
is
reviled
he
has
nothing
personal
to
say
in
answer
to
the
civilities
of
his
adversaries
for
he
knows
no
scandals
of
any
one
and
they
do
not
interest
him
and
therefore
he
is
laughed
at
for
his
sheepishness
and
when
others
are
being
praised
and
glorified
in
the
simplicity
of
his
heart
he
can
not
help
going
into
fits
of
laughter
so
that
he
seems
to
be
a
downright
idiot
when
he
hears
a
tyrant
or
king
eulogized
he
fancies
that
he
is
listening
to
the
praises
of
some
keeper
of
cattle
a
swineherd
or
shepherd
or
perhaps
a
cowherd
who
is
congratulated
on
the
quantity
of
milk
which
he
squeezes
from
them
and
he
remarks
that
the
creature
whom
they
tend
and
out
of
whom
they
squeeze
the
wealth
is
of
a
less
tractable
and
more
insidious
nature
then
again
he
observes
that
the
great
man
is
of
necessity
as
and
uneducated
as
any
shepherd
for
he
has
no
leisure
and
he
is
surrounded
by
a
wall
which
is
his
hearing
of
enormous
landed
proprietors
of
ten
thousand
acres
and
more
our
philosopher
deems
this
to
be
a
trifle
because
he
has
been
accustomed
to
think
of
the
whole
earth
and
when
they
sing
the
praises
of
family
and
say
that
some
one
is
a
gentleman
because
he
can
show
seven
generations
of
wealthy
ancestors
he
thinks
that
their
sentiments
only
betray
a
dull
and
narrow
vision
in
those
who
utter
them
and
who
are
not
educated
enough
to
look
at
the
whole
nor
to
consider
that
every
man
has
had
thousands
and
ten
thousands
of
progenitors
and
among
them
have
been
rich
and
poor
kings
and
slaves
hellenes
and
barbarians
innumerable
and
when
people
pride
themselves
on
having
a
pedigree
of
ancestors
which
goes
back
to
heracles
the
son
of
amphitryon
he
can
not
understand
their
poverty
of
ideas
why
are
they
unable
to
calculate
that
amphitryon
had
a
ancestor
who
might
have
been
anybody
and
was
such
as
fortune
made
him
and
he
had
a
fiftieth
and
so
on
he
amuses
himself
with
the
notion
that
they
can
not
count
and
thinks
that
a
little
arithmetic
would
have
got
rid
of
their
senseless
vanity
now
in
all
these
cases
our
philosopher
is
derided
by
the
vulgar
partly
because
he
is
thought
to
despise
them
and
also
because
he
is
ignorant
of
what
is
before
him
and
always
at
a
loss
theodorus
that
is
very
true
socrates
socrates
but
o
my
friend
when
he
draws
the
other
into
upper
air
and
gets
him
out
of
his
pleas
and
rejoinders
into
the
contemplation
of
justice
and
injustice
in
their
own
nature
and
in
their
difference
from
one
another
and
from
all
other
things
or
from
the
commonplaces
about
the
happiness
of
a
king
or
of
a
rich
man
to
the
consideration
of
government
and
of
human
happiness
and
misery
in
general
what
they
are
and
how
a
man
is
to
attain
the
one
and
avoid
the
other
when
that
narrow
keen
little
legal
mind
is
called
to
account
about
all
this
he
gives
the
philosopher
his
revenge
for
dizzied
by
the
height
at
which
he
is
hanging
whence
he
looks
down
into
space
which
is
a
strange
experience
to
him
he
being
dismayed
and
lost
and
stammering
broken
words
is
laughed
at
not
by
thracian
handmaidens
or
any
other
uneducated
persons
for
they
have
no
eye
for
the
situation
but
by
every
man
who
has
not
been
brought
up
a
slave
such
are
the
two
characters
theodorus
the
one
of
the
freeman
who
has
been
trained
in
liberty
and
leisure
whom
you
call
the
philosopher
him
we
can
not
blame
because
he
appears
simple
and
of
no
account
when
he
has
to
perform
some
menial
task
such
as
packing
up
or
flavouring
a
sauce
or
fawning
speech
the
other
character
is
that
of
the
man
who
is
able
to
do
all
this
kind
of
service
smartly
and
neatly
but
knows
not
how
to
wear
his
cloak
like
a
gentleman
still
less
with
the
music
of
discourse
can
he
hymn
the
true
life
aright
which
is
lived
by
immortals
or
men
blessed
of
heaven
theodorus
if
you
could
only
persuade
everybody
socrates
as
you
do
me
of
the
truth
of
your
words
there
would
be
more
peace
and
fewer
evils
among
men
socrates
evils
theodorus
can
never
pass
away
for
there
must
always
remain
something
which
is
antagonistic
to
good
having
no
place
among
the
gods
in
heaven
of
necessity
they
hover
around
the
mortal
nature
and
this
earthly
sphere
wherefore
we
ought
to
fly
away
from
earth
to
heaven
as
quickly
as
we
can
and
to
fly
away
is
to
become
like
god
as
far
as
this
is
possible
and
to
become
like
him
is
to
become
holy
just
and
wise
but
o
my
friend
you
can
not
easily
convince
mankind
that
they
should
pursue
virtue
or
avoid
vice
not
merely
in
order
that
a
man
may
seem
to
be
good
which
is
the
reason
given
by
the
world
and
in
my
judgment
is
only
a
repetition
of
an
old
wives
fable
whereas
the
truth
is
that
god
is
never
in
any
way
unrighteous
he
is
perfect
righteousness
and
he
of
us
who
is
the
most
righteous
is
most
like
him
herein
is
seen
the
true
cleverness
of
a
man
and
also
his
nothingness
and
want
of
manhood
for
to
know
this
is
true
wisdom
and
virtue
and
ignorance
of
this
is
manifest
folly
and
vice
all
other
kinds
of
wisdom
or
cleverness
which
seem
only
such
as
the
wisdom
of
politicians
or
the
wisdom
of
the
arts
are
coarse
and
vulgar
the
unrighteous
man
or
the
sayer
and
doer
of
unholy
things
had
far
better
not
be
encouraged
in
the
illusion
that
his
roguery
is
clever
for
men
glory
in
their
shame
they
fancy
that
they
hear
others
saying
of
them
are
not
mere
persons
mere
burdens
of
the
earth
but
such
as
men
should
be
who
mean
to
dwell
safely
in
a
state
let
us
tell
them
that
they
are
all
the
more
truly
what
they
do
not
think
they
are
because
they
do
not
know
it
for
they
do
not
know
the
penalty
of
injustice
which
above
all
things
they
ought
to
know
not
stripes
and
death
as
they
suppose
which
often
escape
but
a
penalty
which
can
not
be
escaped
theodorus
what
is
that
socrates
there
are
two
patterns
eternally
set
before
them
the
one
blessed
and
divine
the
other
godless
and
wretched
but
they
do
not
see
them
or
perceive
that
in
their
utter
folly
and
infatuation
they
are
growing
like
the
one
and
unlike
the
other
by
reason
of
their
evil
deeds
and
the
penalty
is
that
they
lead
a
life
answering
to
the
pattern
which
they
are
growing
like
and
if
we
tell
them
that
unless
they
depart
from
their
cunning
the
place
of
innocence
will
not
receive
them
after
death
and
that
here
on
earth
they
will
live
ever
in
the
likeness
of
their
own
evil
selves
and
with
evil
friends
when
they
hear
this
they
in
their
superior
cunning
will
seem
to
be
listening
to
the
talk
of
idiots
theodorus
very
true
socrates
socrates
too
true
my
friend
as
i
well
know
there
is
however
one
peculiarity
in
their
case
when
they
begin
to
reason
in
private
about
their
dislike
of
philosophy
if
they
have
the
courage
to
hear
the
argument
out
and
do
not
run
away
they
grow
at
last
strangely
discontented
with
themselves
their
rhetoric
fades
away
and
they
become
helpless
as
children
these
however
are
digressions
from
which
we
must
now
desist
or
they
will
overflow
and
drown
the
original
argument
to
which
if
you
please
we
will
now
return
theodorus
for
my
part
socrates
i
would
rather
have
the
digressions
for
at
my
age
i
find
them
easier
to
follow
but
if
you
wish
let
us
go
back
to
the
argument
socrates
had
we
not
reached
the
point
at
which
the
partisans
of
the
perpetual
flux
who
say
that
things
are
as
they
seem
to
each
one
were
confidently
maintaining
that
the
ordinances
which
the
state
commanded
and
thought
just
were
just
to
the
state
which
imposed
them
while
they
were
in
force
this
was
especially
asserted
of
justice
but
as
to
the
good
no
one
had
any
longer
the
hardihood
to
contend
of
any
ordinances
which
the
state
thought
and
enacted
to
be
good
that
these
while
they
were
in
force
were
really
good
he
who
said
so
would
be
playing
with
the
name
and
would
not
touch
the
real
question
it
would
be
a
mockery
would
it
not
theodorus
certainly
it
would
socrates
he
ought
not
to
speak
of
the
name
but
of
the
thing
which
is
contemplated
under
the
name
theodorus
right
socrates
whatever
be
the
term
used
the
good
or
expedient
is
the
aim
of
legislation
and
as
far
as
she
has
an
opinion
the
state
imposes
all
laws
with
a
view
to
the
greatest
expediency
can
legislation
have
any
other
aim
theodorus
certainly
not
socrates
but
is
the
aim
attained
always
do
not
mistakes
often
happen
theodorus
yes
i
think
that
there
are
mistakes
socrates
the
possibility
of
error
will
be
more
distinctly
recognised
if
we
put
the
question
in
reference
to
the
whole
class
under
which
the
good
or
expedient
falls
that
whole
class
has
to
do
with
the
future
and
laws
are
passed
under
the
idea
that
they
will
be
useful
in
which
in
other
words
is
the
future
theodorus
very
true
socrates
suppose
now
that
we
ask
protagoras
or
one
of
his
disciples
a
question
o
protagoras
we
will
say
to
him
man
is
as
you
declare
the
measure
of
all
things
white
heavy
light
of
all
such
things
he
is
the
judge
for
he
has
the
criterion
of
them
in
himself
and
when
he
thinks
that
things
are
such
as
he
experiences
them
to
be
he
thinks
what
is
and
is
true
to
himself
is
it
not
so
theodorus
yes
socrates
and
do
you
extend
your
doctrine
protagoras
as
we
shall
further
say
to
the
future
as
well
as
to
the
present
and
has
he
the
criterion
not
only
of
what
in
his
opinion
is
but
of
what
will
be
and
do
things
always
happen
to
him
as
he
expected
for
example
take
the
case
of
heat
when
an
ordinary
man
thinks
that
he
is
going
to
have
a
fever
and
that
this
kind
of
heat
is
coming
on
and
another
person
who
is
a
physician
thinks
the
contrary
whose
opinion
is
likely
to
prove
right
or
are
they
both
right
he
will
have
a
heat
and
fever
in
his
own
judgment
and
not
have
a
fever
in
the
physician
judgment
theodorus
how
ludicrous
socrates
and
the
vinegrower
if
i
am
not
mistaken
is
a
better
judge
of
the
sweetness
or
dryness
of
the
vintage
which
is
not
yet
gathered
than
the
theodorus
certainly
socrates
and
in
musical
composition
the
musician
will
know
better
than
the
training
master
what
the
training
master
himself
will
hereafter
think
harmonious
or
the
reverse
theodorus
of
course
socrates
and
the
cook
will
be
a
better
judge
than
the
guest
who
is
not
a
cook
of
the
pleasure
to
be
derived
from
the
dinner
which
is
in
preparation
for
of
present
or
past
pleasure
we
are
not
as
yet
arguing
but
can
we
say
that
every
one
will
be
to
himself
the
best
judge
of
the
pleasure
which
will
seem
to
be
and
will
be
to
him
in
the
future
nay
would
not
you
protagoras
better
guess
which
arguments
in
a
court
would
convince
any
one
of
us
than
the
ordinary
man
theodorus
certainly
socrates
he
used
to
profess
in
the
strongest
manner
that
he
was
the
superior
of
all
men
in
this
respect
socrates
to
be
sure
friend
who
would
have
paid
a
large
sum
for
the
privilege
of
talking
to
him
if
he
had
really
persuaded
his
visitors
that
neither
a
prophet
nor
any
other
man
was
better
able
to
judge
what
will
be
and
seem
to
be
in
the
future
than
every
one
could
for
himself
theodorus
who
indeed
socrates
and
legislation
and
expediency
are
all
concerned
with
the
future
and
every
one
will
admit
that
states
in
passing
laws
must
often
fail
of
their
highest
interests
theodorus
quite
true
socrates
then
we
may
fairly
argue
against
your
master
that
he
must
admit
one
man
to
be
wiser
than
another
and
that
the
wiser
is
a
measure
but
i
who
know
nothing
am
not
at
all
obliged
to
accept
the
honour
which
the
advocate
of
protagoras
was
just
now
forcing
upon
me
whether
i
would
or
not
of
being
a
measure
of
anything
theodorus
that
is
the
best
refutation
of
him
socrates
although
he
is
also
caught
when
he
ascribes
truth
to
the
opinions
of
others
who
give
the
lie
direct
to
his
own
opinion
socrates
there
are
many
ways
theodorus
in
which
the
doctrine
that
every
opinion
of
every
man
is
true
may
be
refuted
but
there
is
more
difficulty
in
proving
that
states
of
feeling
which
are
present
to
a
man
and
out
of
which
arise
sensations
and
opinions
in
accordance
with
them
are
also
untrue
and
very
likely
i
have
been
talking
nonsense
about
them
for
they
may
be
unassailable
and
those
who
say
that
there
is
clear
evidence
of
them
and
that
they
are
matters
of
knowledge
may
probably
be
right
in
which
case
our
friend
theaetetus
was
not
so
far
from
the
mark
when
he
identified
perception
and
knowledge
and
therefore
let
us
draw
nearer
as
the
advocate
of
protagoras
desires
and
give
the
truth
of
the
universal
flux
a
ring
is
the
theory
sound
or
not
at
any
rate
no
small
war
is
raging
about
it
and
there
are
combination
not
a
few
theodorus
no
small
war
indeed
for
in
ionia
the
sect
makes
rapid
strides
the
disciples
of
heracleitus
are
most
energetic
upholders
of
the
doctrine
socrates
then
we
are
the
more
bound
my
dear
theodorus
to
examine
the
question
from
the
foundation
as
it
is
set
forth
by
themselves
theodorus
certainly
we
are
about
these
speculations
of
heracleitus
which
as
you
say
are
as
old
as
homer
or
even
older
still
the
ephesians
themselves
who
profess
to
know
them
are
downright
mad
and
you
can
not
talk
with
them
on
the
subject
for
in
accordance
with
their
they
are
always
in
motion
but
as
for
dwelling
upon
an
argument
or
a
question
and
quietly
asking
and
answering
in
turn
they
can
no
more
do
so
than
they
can
fly
or
rather
the
determination
of
these
fellows
not
to
have
a
particle
of
rest
in
them
is
more
than
the
utmost
powers
of
negation
can
express
if
you
ask
any
of
them
a
question
he
will
produce
as
from
a
quiver
sayings
brief
and
dark
and
shoot
them
at
you
and
if
you
inquire
the
reason
of
what
he
has
said
you
will
be
hit
by
some
other
word
and
will
make
no
way
with
any
of
them
nor
they
with
one
another
their
great
care
is
not
to
allow
of
any
settled
principle
either
in
their
arguments
or
in
their
minds
conceiving
as
i
imagine
that
any
such
principle
would
be
stationary
for
they
are
at
war
with
the
stationary
and
do
what
they
can
to
drive
it
out
everywhere
socrates
i
suppose
theodorus
that
you
have
only
seen
them
when
they
were
fighting
and
have
never
stayed
with
them
in
time
of
peace
for
they
are
no
friends
of
yours
and
their
peace
doctrines
are
only
communicated
by
them
at
leisure
as
i
imagine
to
those
disciples
of
theirs
whom
they
want
to
make
like
themselves
theodorus
disciples
my
good
sir
they
have
none
men
of
their
sort
are
not
one
another
disciples
but
they
grow
up
at
their
own
sweet
will
and
get
their
inspiration
anywhere
each
of
them
saying
of
his
neighbour
that
he
knows
nothing
from
these
men
then
as
i
was
going
to
remark
you
will
never
get
a
reason
whether
with
their
will
or
without
their
will
we
must
take
the
question
out
of
their
hands
and
make
the
analysis
ourselves
as
if
we
were
doing
geometrical
problem
socrates
quite
right
too
but
as
touching
the
aforesaid
problem
have
we
not
heard
from
the
ancients
who
concealed
their
wisdom
from
the
many
in
poetical
figures
that
oceanus
and
tethys
the
origin
of
all
things
are
streams
and
that
nothing
is
at
rest
and
now
the
moderns
in
their
superior
wisdom
have
declared
the
same
openly
that
the
cobbler
too
may
hear
and
learn
of
them
and
no
longer
foolishly
imagine
that
some
things
are
at
rest
and
others
in
motion
having
learned
that
all
is
motion
he
will
duly
honour
his
teachers
i
had
almost
forgotten
the
opposite
doctrine
theodorus
being
remains
unmoved
which
is
the
name
for
the
all
this
is
the
language
of
parmenides
melissus
and
their
followers
who
stoutly
maintain
that
all
being
is
one
and
and
has
no
place
in
which
to
move
what
shall
we
do
friend
with
all
these
people
for
advancing
step
by
step
we
have
imperceptibly
got
between
the
combatants
and
unless
we
can
protect
our
retreat
we
shall
pay
the
penalty
of
our
rashness
like
the
players
in
the
palaestra
who
are
caught
upon
the
line
and
are
dragged
different
ways
by
the
two
parties
therefore
i
think
that
we
had
better
begin
by
considering
those
whom
we
first
accosted
and
if
we
find
any
truth
in
them
we
will
help
them
to
pull
us
over
and
try
to
get
away
from
the
others
but
if
the
partisans
of
whole
appear
to
speak
more
truly
we
will
fly
off
from
the
party
which
would
move
the
immovable
to
them
and
if
i
find
that
neither
of
them
have
anything
reasonable
to
say
we
shall
be
in
a
ridiculous
position
having
so
great
a
conceit
of
our
own
poor
opinion
and
rejecting
that
of
ancient
and
famous
men
o
theodorus
do
you
think
that
there
is
any
use
in
proceeding
when
the
danger
is
so
great
theodorus
nay
socrates
not
to
examine
thoroughly
what
the
two
parties
have
to
say
would
be
quite
intolerable
socrates
then
examine
we
must
since
you
who
were
so
reluctant
to
begin
are
so
eager
to
proceed
the
nature
of
motion
appears
to
be
the
question
with
which
we
begin
what
do
they
mean
when
they
say
that
all
things
are
in
motion
is
there
only
one
kind
of
motion
or
as
i
rather
incline
to
think
two
i
should
like
to
have
your
opinion
upon
this
point
in
addition
to
my
own
that
i
may
err
if
i
must
err
in
your
company
tell
me
then
when
a
thing
changes
from
one
place
to
another
or
goes
round
in
the
same
place
is
not
that
what
is
called
motion
theodorus
yes
socrates
here
then
we
have
one
kind
of
motion
but
when
a
thing
remaining
on
the
same
spot
grows
old
or
becomes
black
from
being
white
or
hard
from
being
soft
or
undergoes
any
other
change
may
not
this
be
properly
called
motion
of
another
kind
theodorus
i
think
so
socrates
say
rather
that
it
must
be
so
of
motion
then
there
are
these
two
kinds
and
in
place
theodorus
you
are
right
socrates
and
now
having
made
this
distinction
let
us
address
ourselves
to
those
who
say
that
all
is
motion
and
ask
them
whether
all
things
according
to
them
have
the
two
kinds
of
motion
and
are
changed
as
well
as
move
in
place
or
is
one
thing
moved
in
both
ways
and
another
in
one
only
theodorus
indeed
i
do
not
know
what
to
answer
but
i
think
they
would
say
that
all
things
are
moved
in
both
ways
socrates
yes
comrade
for
if
not
they
would
have
to
say
that
the
same
things
are
in
motion
and
at
rest
and
there
would
be
no
more
truth
in
saying
that
all
things
are
in
motion
than
that
all
things
are
at
rest
theodorus
to
be
sure
socrates
and
if
they
are
to
be
in
motion
and
nothing
is
to
be
devoid
of
motion
all
things
must
always
have
every
sort
of
motion
theodorus
most
true
socrates
consider
a
further
point
did
we
not
understand
them
to
explain
the
generation
of
heat
whiteness
or
anything
else
in
some
such
manner
as
the
following
were
they
not
saying
that
each
of
them
is
moving
between
the
agent
and
the
patient
together
with
a
perception
and
that
the
patient
ceases
to
be
a
perceiving
power
and
becomes
a
percipient
and
the
agent
a
quale
instead
of
a
quality
i
suspect
that
quality
may
appear
a
strange
and
uncouth
term
to
you
and
that
you
do
not
understand
the
abstract
expression
then
i
will
take
concrete
instances
i
mean
to
say
that
the
producing
power
or
agent
becomes
neither
heat
nor
whiteness
but
hot
and
white
and
the
like
of
other
things
for
i
must
repeat
what
i
said
before
that
neither
the
agent
nor
patient
have
any
absolute
existence
but
when
they
come
together
and
generate
sensations
and
their
objects
the
one
becomes
a
thing
of
a
certain
quality
and
the
other
a
percipient
you
remember
theodorus
of
course
socrates
we
may
leave
the
details
of
their
theory
unexamined
but
we
must
not
forget
to
ask
them
the
only
question
with
which
we
are
concerned
are
all
things
in
motion
and
flux
theodorus
yes
they
will
reply
socrates
and
they
are
moved
in
both
those
ways
which
we
distinguished
that
is
to
say
they
move
in
place
and
are
also
changed
theodorus
of
course
if
the
motion
is
to
be
perfect
socrates
if
they
only
moved
in
place
and
were
not
changed
we
should
be
able
to
say
what
is
the
nature
of
the
things
which
are
in
motion
and
flux
theodorus
exactly
socrates
but
now
since
not
even
white
continues
to
flow
white
and
whiteness
itself
is
a
flux
or
change
which
is
passing
into
another
colour
and
is
never
to
be
caught
standing
still
can
the
name
of
any
colour
be
rightly
used
at
all
theodorus
how
is
that
possible
socrates
either
in
the
case
of
this
or
of
any
other
quality
if
while
we
are
using
the
word
the
object
is
escaping
in
the
flux
socrates
and
what
would
you
say
of
perceptions
such
as
sight
and
hearing
or
any
other
kind
of
perception
is
there
any
stopping
in
the
act
of
seeing
and
hearing
theodorus
certainly
not
if
all
things
are
in
motion
socrates
then
we
must
not
speak
of
seeing
any
more
than
of
nor
of
any
other
perception
more
than
of
any
if
all
things
partake
of
every
kind
of
motion
theodorus
certainly
not
socrates
yet
perception
is
knowledge
so
at
least
theaetetus
and
i
were
saying
theodorus
very
true
socrates
then
when
we
were
asked
what
is
knowledge
we
no
more
answered
what
is
knowledge
than
what
is
not
knowledge
theodorus
i
suppose
not
socrates
here
then
is
a
fine
result
we
corrected
our
first
answer
in
our
eagerness
to
prove
that
nothing
is
at
rest
but
if
nothing
is
at
rest
every
answer
upon
whatever
subject
is
equally
right
you
may
say
that
a
thing
is
or
is
not
thus
or
if
you
prefer
thus
and
if
we
say
we
shall
not
then
hamper
them
with
words
expressive
of
rest
theodorus
quite
true
socrates
yes
theodorus
except
in
saying
and
thus
but
you
ought
not
to
use
the
word
for
there
is
no
motion
in
or
in
thus
the
maintainers
of
the
doctrine
have
as
yet
no
words
in
which
to
express
themselves
and
must
get
a
new
language
i
know
of
no
word
that
will
suit
them
except
perhaps
how
which
is
perfectly
indefinite
theodorus
yes
that
is
a
manner
of
speaking
in
which
they
will
be
quite
at
home
socrates
and
so
theodorus
we
have
got
rid
of
your
friend
without
assenting
to
his
doctrine
that
every
man
is
the
measure
of
all
things
a
wise
man
only
is
a
measure
neither
can
we
allow
that
knowledge
is
perception
certainly
not
on
the
hypothesis
of
a
perpetual
flux
unless
perchance
our
friend
theaetetus
is
able
to
convince
us
that
it
is
theodorus
very
good
socrates
and
now
that
the
argument
about
the
doctrine
of
protagoras
has
been
completed
i
am
absolved
from
answering
for
this
was
the
agreement
theaetetus
not
theodorus
until
you
and
socrates
have
discussed
the
doctrine
of
those
who
say
that
all
things
are
at
rest
as
you
were
proposing
theodorus
you
theaetetus
who
are
a
young
rogue
must
not
instigate
your
elders
to
a
breach
of
faith
but
should
prepare
to
answer
socrates
in
the
remainder
of
the
argument
theaetetus
yes
if
he
wishes
but
i
would
rather
have
heard
about
the
doctrine
of
rest
theodorus
invite
socrates
to
an
argument
invite
horsemen
to
the
open
plain
do
but
ask
him
and
he
will
answer
socrates
nevertheless
theodorus
i
am
afraid
that
i
shall
not
be
able
to
comply
with
the
request
of
theaetetus
theodorus
not
comply
for
what
reason
socrates
my
reason
is
that
i
have
a
kind
of
reverence
not
so
much
for
melissus
and
the
others
who
say
that
is
one
and
at
rest
as
for
the
great
leader
himself
parmenides
venerable
and
awful
as
in
homeric
language
he
may
be
called
him
i
should
be
ashamed
to
approach
in
a
spirit
unworthy
of
him
i
met
him
when
he
was
an
old
man
and
i
was
a
mere
youth
and
he
appeared
to
me
to
have
a
glorious
depth
of
mind
and
i
am
afraid
that
we
may
not
understand
his
words
and
may
be
still
further
from
understanding
his
meaning
above
all
i
fear
that
the
nature
of
knowledge
which
is
the
main
subject
of
our
discussion
may
be
thrust
out
of
sight
by
the
unbidden
guests
who
will
come
pouring
in
upon
our
feast
of
discourse
if
we
let
them
in
besides
the
question
which
is
now
stirring
is
of
immense
extent
and
will
be
treated
unfairly
if
only
considered
by
the
way
or
if
treated
adequately
and
at
length
will
put
into
the
shade
the
other
question
of
knowledge
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
can
be
allowed
but
i
must
try
by
my
art
of
midwifery
to
deliver
theaetetus
of
his
conceptions
about
knowledge
theaetetus
very
well
do
so
if
you
will
socrates
then
now
theaetetus
take
another
view
of
the
subject
you
answered
that
knowledge
is
perception
theaetetus
i
did
socrates
and
if
any
one
were
to
ask
you
with
what
does
a
man
see
black
and
white
colours
and
with
what
does
he
hear
high
and
low
sounds
you
would
say
if
i
am
not
mistaken
the
eyes
and
with
the
ears
theaetetus
i
should
socrates
the
free
use
of
words
and
phrases
rather
than
minute
precision
is
generally
characteristic
of
a
liberal
education
and
the
opposite
is
pedantic
but
sometimes
precision
is
necessary
and
i
believe
that
the
answer
which
you
have
just
given
is
open
to
the
charge
of
incorrectness
for
which
is
more
correct
to
say
that
we
see
or
hear
with
the
eyes
and
with
the
ears
or
through
the
eyes
and
through
the
ears
theaetetus
i
should
say
socrates
rather
than
socrates
yes
my
boy
for
no
one
can
suppose
that
in
each
of
us
as
in
a
sort
of
trojan
horse
there
are
perched
a
number
of
unconnected
senses
which
do
not
all
meet
in
some
one
nature
the
mind
or
whatever
we
please
to
call
it
of
which
they
are
the
instruments
and
with
which
through
them
we
perceive
objects
of
sense
theaetetus
i
agree
with
you
in
that
opinion
socrates
the
reason
why
i
am
thus
precise
is
because
i
want
to
know
whether
when
we
perceive
black
and
white
through
the
eyes
and
again
other
qualities
through
other
organs
we
do
not
perceive
them
with
one
and
the
same
part
of
ourselves
and
if
you
were
asked
you
might
refer
all
such
perceptions
to
the
body
perhaps
however
i
had
better
allow
you
to
answer
for
yourself
and
not
interfere
tell
me
then
are
not
the
organs
through
which
you
perceive
warm
and
hard
and
light
and
sweet
organs
of
the
body
theaetetus
of
the
body
certainly
socrates
and
you
would
admit
that
what
you
perceive
through
one
faculty
you
can
not
perceive
through
another
the
objects
of
hearing
for
example
can
not
be
perceived
through
sight
or
the
objects
of
sight
through
hearing
theaetetus
of
course
not
socrates
if
you
have
any
thought
about
both
of
them
this
common
perception
can
not
come
to
you
either
through
the
one
or
the
other
organ
theaetetus
it
can
not
socrates
how
about
sounds
and
colours
in
the
first
place
you
would
admit
that
they
both
exist
theaetetus
yes
socrates
and
that
either
of
them
is
different
from
the
other
and
the
same
with
itself
theaetetus
certainly
socrates
and
that
both
are
two
and
each
of
them
one
theaetetus
yes
socrates
you
can
further
observe
whether
they
are
like
or
unlike
one
another
theaetetus
i
dare
say
socrates
but
through
what
do
you
perceive
all
this
about
them
for
neither
through
hearing
nor
yet
through
seeing
can
you
apprehend
that
which
they
have
in
common
let
me
give
you
an
illustration
of
the
point
at
issue
if
there
were
any
meaning
in
asking
whether
sounds
and
colours
are
saline
or
not
you
would
be
able
to
tell
me
what
faculty
would
consider
the
question
it
would
not
be
sight
or
hearing
but
some
other
theaetetus
certainly
the
faculty
of
taste
socrates
very
good
and
now
tell
me
what
is
the
power
which
discerns
not
only
in
sensible
objects
but
in
all
things
universal
notions
such
as
those
which
are
called
being
and
and
those
others
about
which
we
were
just
asking
what
organs
will
you
assign
for
the
perception
of
these
notions
theaetetus
you
are
thinking
of
being
and
not
being
likeness
and
unlikeness
sameness
and
difference
and
also
of
unity
and
other
numbers
which
are
applied
to
objects
of
sense
and
you
mean
to
ask
through
what
bodily
organ
the
soul
perceives
odd
and
even
numbers
and
other
arithmetical
conceptions
socrates
you
follow
me
excellently
theaetetus
that
is
precisely
what
i
am
asking
theaetetus
indeed
socrates
i
can
not
answer
my
only
notion
is
that
these
unlike
objects
of
sense
have
no
separate
organ
but
that
the
mind
by
a
power
of
her
own
contemplates
the
universals
in
all
things
socrates
you
are
a
beauty
theaetetus
and
not
ugly
as
theodorus
was
saying
for
he
who
utters
the
beautiful
is
himself
beautiful
and
good
and
besides
being
beautiful
you
have
done
me
a
kindness
in
releasing
me
from
a
very
long
discussion
if
you
are
clear
that
the
soul
views
some
things
by
herself
and
others
through
the
bodily
organs
for
that
was
my
own
opinion
and
i
wanted
you
to
agree
with
me
theaetetus
i
am
quite
clear
socrates
and
to
which
class
would
you
refer
being
or
essence
for
this
of
all
our
notions
is
the
most
universal
theaetetus
i
should
say
to
that
class
which
the
soul
aspires
to
know
of
herself
socrates
and
would
you
say
this
also
of
like
and
unlike
same
and
other
theaetetus
yes
socrates
and
would
you
say
the
same
of
the
noble
and
base
and
of
good
and
evil
theaetetus
these
i
conceive
to
be
notions
which
are
essentially
relative
and
which
the
soul
also
perceives
by
comparing
in
herself
things
past
and
present
with
the
future
socrates
and
does
she
not
perceive
the
hardness
of
that
which
is
hard
by
the
touch
and
the
softness
of
that
which
is
soft
equally
by
the
touch
theaetetus
yes
socrates
but
their
essence
and
what
they
are
and
their
opposition
to
one
another
and
the
essential
nature
of
this
opposition
the
soul
herself
endeavours
to
decide
for
us
by
the
review
and
comparison
of
them
theaetetus
certainly
socrates
the
simple
sensations
which
reach
the
soul
through
the
body
are
given
at
birth
to
men
and
animals
by
nature
but
their
reflections
on
the
being
and
use
of
them
are
slowly
and
hardly
gained
if
they
are
ever
gained
by
education
and
long
experience
theaetetus
assuredly
socrates
and
can
a
man
attain
truth
who
fails
of
attaining
being
theaetetus
impossible
socrates
and
can
he
who
misses
the
truth
of
anything
have
a
knowledge
of
that
thing
theaetetus
he
can
not
socrates
then
knowledge
does
not
consist
in
impressions
of
sense
but
in
reasoning
about
them
in
that
only
and
not
in
the
mere
impression
truth
and
being
can
be
attained
theaetetus
clearly
socrates
and
would
you
call
the
two
processes
by
the
same
name
when
there
is
so
great
a
difference
between
them
theaetetus
that
would
certainly
not
be
right
socrates
and
what
name
would
you
give
to
seeing
hearing
smelling
being
cold
and
being
hot
theaetetus
i
should
call
all
of
them
perceiving
what
other
name
could
be
given
to
them
socrates
perception
would
be
the
collective
name
of
them
theaetetus
certainly
socrates
which
as
we
say
has
no
part
in
the
attainment
of
truth
any
more
than
of
being
theaetetus
certainly
not
socrates
and
therefore
not
in
science
or
knowledge
theaetetus
no
socrates
then
perception
theaetetus
can
never
be
the
same
as
knowledge
or
science
theaetetus
clearly
not
socrates
and
knowledge
has
now
been
most
distinctly
proved
to
be
different
from
perception
socrates
but
the
original
aim
of
our
discussion
was
to
find
out
rather
what
knowledge
is
than
what
it
is
not
at
the
same
time
we
have
made
some
progress
for
we
no
longer
seek
for
knowledge
in
perception
at
all
but
in
that
other
process
however
called
in
which
the
mind
is
alone
and
engaged
with
being
theaetetus
you
mean
socrates
if
i
am
not
mistaken
what
is
called
thinking
or
opining
socrates
you
conceive
truly
and
now
my
friend
please
to
begin
again
at
this
point
and
having
wiped
out
of
your
memory
all
that
has
preceded
see
if
you
have
arrived
at
any
clearer
view
and
once
more
say
what
is
knowledge
theaetetus
i
can
not
say
socrates
that
all
opinion
is
knowledge
because
there
may
be
a
false
opinion
but
i
will
venture
to
assert
that
knowledge
is
true
opinion
let
this
then
be
my
reply
and
if
this
is
hereafter
disproved
i
must
try
to
find
another
socrates
that
is
the
way
in
which
you
ought
to
answer
theaetetus
and
not
in
your
former
hesitating
strain
for
if
we
are
bold
we
shall
gain
one
of
two
advantages
either
we
shall
find
what
we
seek
or
we
shall
be
less
likely
to
think
that
we
know
what
we
do
not
know
in
either
case
we
shall
be
richly
rewarded
and
now
what
are
you
saying
are
there
two
sorts
of
opinion
one
true
and
the
other
false
and
do
you
define
knowledge
to
be
the
true
theaetetus
yes
according
to
my
present
view
socrates
is
it
still
worth
our
while
to
resume
the
discussion
touching
opinion
theaetetus
to
what
are
you
alluding
socrates
there
is
a
point
which
often
troubles
me
and
is
a
great
perplexity
to
me
both
in
regard
to
myself
and
others
i
can
not
make
out
the
nature
or
origin
of
the
mental
experience
to
which
i
refer
theaetetus
pray
what
is
it
socrates
how
there
can
be
false
opinion
that
difficulty
still
troubles
the
eye
of
my
mind
and
i
am
uncertain
whether
i
shall
leave
the
question
or
begin
over
again
in
a
new
way
theaetetus
begin
again
socrates
at
least
if
you
think
that
there
is
the
slightest
necessity
for
doing
so
were
not
you
and
theodorus
just
now
remarking
very
truly
that
in
discussions
of
this
kind
we
may
take
our
own
time
socrates
you
are
quite
right
and
perhaps
there
will
be
no
harm
in
retracing
our
steps
and
beginning
again
better
a
little
which
is
well
done
than
a
great
deal
imperfectly
theaetetus
certainly
socrates
well
and
what
is
the
difficulty
do
we
not
speak
of
false
opinion
and
say
that
one
man
holds
a
false
and
another
a
true
opinion
as
though
there
were
some
natural
distinction
between
them
theaetetus
we
certainly
say
so
socrates
all
things
and
everything
are
either
known
or
not
known
i
leave
out
of
view
the
intermediate
conceptions
of
learning
and
forgetting
because
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
our
present
question
theaetetus
there
can
be
no
doubt
socrates
if
you
exclude
these
that
there
is
no
other
alternative
but
knowing
or
not
knowing
a
thing
socrates
that
point
being
now
determined
must
we
not
say
that
he
who
has
an
opinion
must
have
an
opinion
about
something
which
he
knows
or
does
not
know
theaetetus
he
must
socrates
he
who
knows
can
not
but
know
and
he
who
does
not
know
can
not
know
theaetetus
of
course
socrates
what
shall
we
say
then
when
a
man
has
a
false
opinion
does
he
think
that
which
he
knows
to
be
some
other
thing
which
he
knows
and
knowing
both
is
he
at
the
same
time
ignorant
of
both
theaetetus
that
socrates
is
impossible
socrates
but
perhaps
he
thinks
of
something
which
he
does
not
know
as
some
other
thing
which
he
does
not
know
for
example
he
knows
neither
theaetetus
nor
socrates
and
yet
he
fancies
that
theaetetus
is
socrates
or
socrates
theaetetus
theaetetus
how
can
he
socrates
but
surely
he
can
not
suppose
what
he
knows
to
be
what
he
does
not
know
or
what
he
does
not
know
to
be
what
he
knows
theaetetus
that
would
be
monstrous
socrates
where
then
is
false
opinion
for
if
all
things
are
either
known
or
unknown
there
can
be
no
opinion
which
is
not
comprehended
under
this
alternative
and
so
false
opinion
is
excluded
theaetetus
most
true
socrates
suppose
that
we
remove
the
question
out
of
the
sphere
of
knowing
or
not
knowing
into
that
of
being
and
theaetetus
what
do
you
mean
socrates
may
we
not
suspect
the
simple
truth
to
be
that
he
who
thinks
about
anything
that
which
is
not
will
necessarily
think
what
is
false
whatever
in
other
respects
may
be
the
state
of
his
mind
theaetetus
that
again
is
not
unlikely
socrates
socrates
then
suppose
some
one
to
say
to
us
theaetetus
is
it
possible
for
any
man
to
think
that
which
is
not
either
as
a
substance
or
as
a
predicate
of
something
else
and
suppose
that
we
answer
he
can
when
he
thinks
what
is
not
true
that
will
be
our
answer
theaetetus
yes
socrates
but
is
there
any
parallel
to
this
theaetetus
what
do
you
mean
socrates
can
a
man
see
something
and
yet
see
nothing
theaetetus
impossible
socrates
but
if
he
sees
any
one
thing
he
sees
something
that
exists
do
you
suppose
that
what
is
one
is
ever
to
be
found
among
things
theaetetus
i
do
not
socrates
he
then
who
sees
some
one
thing
sees
something
which
is
theaetetus
clearly
socrates
and
he
who
hears
anything
hears
some
one
thing
and
hears
that
which
is
theaetetus
yes
socrates
and
he
who
touches
anything
touches
something
which
is
one
and
therefore
is
theaetetus
that
again
is
true
socrates
and
does
not
he
who
thinks
think
some
one
thing
theaetetus
certainly
socrates
and
does
not
he
who
thinks
some
one
thing
think
something
which
is
theaetetus
i
agree
socrates
then
he
who
thinks
of
that
which
is
not
thinks
of
nothing
theaetetus
clearly
socrates
and
he
who
thinks
of
nothing
does
not
think
at
all
theaetetus
obviously
socrates
then
no
one
can
think
that
which
is
not
either
as
a
substance
or
as
a
predicate
of
something
else
theaetetus
clearly
not
socrates
then
to
think
falsely
is
different
from
thinking
that
which
is
not
theaetetus
it
would
seem
so
socrates
then
false
opinion
has
no
existence
in
us
either
in
the
sphere
of
being
or
of
knowledge
theaetetus
certainly
not
socrates
but
may
not
the
following
be
the
description
of
what
we
express
by
this
name
theaetetus
what
socrates
may
we
not
suppose
that
false
opinion
or
thought
is
a
sort
of
heterodoxy
a
person
may
make
an
exchange
in
his
mind
and
say
that
one
real
object
is
another
real
object
for
thus
he
always
thinks
that
which
is
but
he
puts
one
thing
in
place
of
another
and
missing
the
aim
of
his
thoughts
he
may
be
truly
said
to
have
false
opinion
theaetetus
now
you
appear
to
me
to
have
spoken
the
exact
truth
when
a
man
puts
the
base
in
the
place
of
the
noble
or
the
noble
in
the
place
of
the
base
then
he
has
truly
false
opinion
socrates
i
see
theaetetus
that
your
fear
has
disappeared
and
that
you
are
beginning
to
despise
me
theaetetus
what
makes
you
say
so
socrates
you
think
if
i
am
not
mistaken
that
your
false
is
safe
from
censure
and
that
i
shall
never
ask
whether
there
can
be
a
swift
which
is
slow
or
a
heavy
which
is
light
or
any
other
thing
which
works
not
according
to
its
own
nature
but
according
to
that
of
its
opposite
but
i
will
not
insist
upon
this
for
i
do
not
wish
needlessly
to
discourage
you
and
so
you
are
satisfied
that
false
opinion
is
heterodoxy
or
the
thought
of
something
else
theaetetus
i
am
socrates
it
is
possible
then
upon
your
view
for
the
mind
to
conceive
of
one
thing
as
another
theaetetus
true
socrates
but
must
not
the
mind
or
thinking
power
which
misplaces
them
have
a
conception
either
of
both
objects
or
of
one
of
them
theaetetus
certainly
socrates
either
together
or
in
succession
theaetetus
very
good
socrates
and
do
you
mean
by
conceiving
the
same
which
i
mean
theaetetus
what
is
that
socrates
i
mean
the
conversation
which
the
soul
holds
with
herself
in
considering
of
anything
i
speak
of
what
i
scarcely
understand
but
the
soul
when
thinking
appears
to
me
to
be
just
talking
asking
questions
of
herself
and
answering
them
affirming
and
denying
and
when
she
has
arrived
at
a
decision
either
gradually
or
by
a
sudden
impulse
and
has
at
last
agreed
and
does
not
doubt
this
is
called
her
opinion
i
say
then
that
to
form
an
opinion
is
to
speak
and
opinion
is
a
word
spoken
i
mean
to
oneself
and
in
silence
not
aloud
or
to
another
what
think
you
theaetetus
i
agree
socrates
then
when
any
one
thinks
of
one
thing
as
another
he
is
saying
to
himself
that
one
thing
is
another
theaetetus
yes
socrates
but
do
you
ever
remember
saying
to
yourself
that
the
noble
is
certainly
base
or
the
unjust
just
or
best
of
all
have
you
ever
attempted
to
convince
yourself
that
one
thing
is
another
nay
not
even
in
sleep
did
you
ever
venture
to
say
to
yourself
that
odd
is
even
or
anything
of
the
kind
theaetetus
never
socrates
and
do
you
suppose
that
any
other
man
either
in
his
senses
or
out
of
them
ever
seriously
tried
to
persuade
himself
that
an
ox
is
a
horse
or
that
two
are
one
theaetetus
certainly
not
socrates
but
if
thinking
is
talking
to
oneself
no
one
speaking
and
thinking
of
two
objects
and
apprehending
them
both
in
his
soul
will
say
and
think
that
the
one
is
the
other
of
them
and
i
must
add
that
even
you
lover
of
dispute
as
you
are
had
better
let
the
word
alone
not
insist
that
and
are
the
same
both
words
in
greek
are
called
eteron
compare
parmen
i
mean
to
say
that
no
one
thinks
the
noble
to
be
base
or
anything
of
the
kind
theaetetus
i
will
give
up
the
word
socrates
and
i
agree
to
what
you
say
socrates
if
a
man
has
both
of
them
in
his
thoughts
he
can
not
think
that
the
one
of
them
is
the
other
theaetetus
true
socrates
neither
if
he
has
one
of
them
only
in
his
mind
and
not
the
other
can
he
think
that
one
is
the
other
theaetetus
true
for
we
should
have
to
suppose
that
he
apprehends
that
which
is
not
in
his
thoughts
at
all
socrates
then
no
one
who
has
either
both
or
only
one
of
the
two
objects
in
his
mind
can
think
that
the
one
is
the
other
and
therefore
he
who
maintains
that
false
opinion
is
heterodoxy
is
talking
nonsense
for
neither
in
this
any
more
than
in
the
previous
way
can
false
opinion
exist
in
us
theaetetus
no
socrates
but
if
theaetetus
this
is
not
admitted
we
shall
be
driven
into
many
absurdities
theaetetus
what
are
they
socrates
i
will
not
tell
you
until
i
have
endeavoured
to
consider
the
matter
from
every
point
of
view
for
i
should
be
ashamed
of
us
if
we
were
driven
in
our
perplexity
to
admit
the
absurd
consequences
of
which
i
speak
but
if
we
find
the
solution
and
get
away
from
them
we
may
regard
them
only
as
the
difficulties
of
others
and
the
ridicule
will
not
attach
to
us
on
the
other
hand
if
we
utterly
fail
i
suppose
that
we
must
be
humble
and
allow
the
argument
to
trample
us
under
foot
as
the
passenger
is
trampled
upon
by
the
sailor
and
to
do
anything
to
us
listen
then
while
i
tell
you
how
i
hope
to
find
a
way
out
of
our
difficulty
theaetetus
let
me
hear
socrates
i
think
that
we
were
wrong
in
denying
that
a
man
could
think
what
he
knew
to
be
what
he
did
not
know
and
that
there
is
a
way
in
which
such
a
deception
is
possible
theaetetus
you
mean
to
say
as
i
suspected
at
the
time
that
i
may
know
socrates
and
at
a
distance
see
some
one
who
is
unknown
to
me
and
whom
i
mistake
for
him
then
the
deception
will
occur
socrates
but
has
not
that
position
been
relinquished
by
us
because
involving
the
absurdity
that
we
should
know
and
not
know
the
things
which
we
know
theaetetus
true
socrates
let
us
make
the
assertion
in
another
form
which
may
or
may
not
have
a
favourable
issue
but
as
we
are
in
a
great
strait
every
argument
should
be
turned
over
and
tested
tell
me
then
whether
i
am
right
in
saying
that
you
may
learn
a
thing
which
at
one
time
you
did
not
know
theaetetus
certainly
you
may
socrates
and
another
and
another
theaetetus
yes
socrates
i
would
have
you
imagine
then
that
there
exists
in
the
mind
of
man
a
block
of
wax
which
is
of
different
sizes
in
different
men
harder
moister
and
having
more
or
less
of
purity
in
one
than
another
and
in
some
of
an
intermediate
quality
theaetetus
i
see
socrates
let
us
say
that
this
tablet
is
a
gift
of
memory
the
mother
of
the
muses
and
that
when
we
wish
to
remember
anything
which
we
have
seen
or
heard
or
thought
in
our
own
minds
we
hold
the
wax
to
the
perceptions
and
thoughts
and
in
that
material
receive
the
impression
of
them
as
from
the
seal
of
a
ring
and
that
we
remember
and
know
what
is
imprinted
as
long
as
the
image
lasts
but
when
the
image
is
effaced
or
can
not
be
taken
then
we
forget
and
do
not
know
theaetetus
very
good
socrates
now
when
a
person
has
this
knowledge
and
is
considering
something
which
he
sees
or
hears
may
not
false
opinion
arise
in
the
following
manner
theaetetus
in
what
manner
socrates
when
he
thinks
what
he
knows
sometimes
to
be
what
he
knows
and
sometimes
to
be
what
he
does
not
know
we
were
wrong
before
in
denying
the
possibility
of
this
theaetetus
and
how
would
you
amend
the
former
statement
socrates
i
should
begin
by
making
a
list
of
the
impossible
cases
which
must
be
excluded
no
one
can
think
one
thing
to
be
another
when
he
does
not
perceive
either
of
them
but
has
the
memorial
or
seal
of
both
of
them
in
his
mind
nor
can
any
mistaking
of
one
thing
for
another
occur
when
he
only
knows
one
and
does
not
know
and
has
no
impression
of
the
other
nor
can
he
think
that
one
thing
which
he
does
not
know
is
another
thing
which
he
does
not
know
or
that
what
he
does
not
know
is
what
he
knows
nor
that
one
thing
which
he
perceives
is
another
thing
which
he
perceives
or
that
something
which
he
perceives
is
something
which
he
does
not
perceive
or
that
something
which
he
does
not
perceive
is
something
else
which
he
does
not
perceive
or
that
something
which
he
does
not
perceive
is
something
which
he
perceives
nor
again
can
he
think
that
something
which
he
knows
and
perceives
and
of
which
he
has
the
impression
coinciding
with
sense
is
something
else
which
he
knows
and
perceives
and
of
which
he
has
the
impression
coinciding
with
sense
this
last
case
if
possible
is
still
more
inconceivable
than
the
others
nor
can
he
think
that
something
which
he
knows
and
perceives
and
of
which
he
has
the
memorial
coinciding
with
sense
is
something
else
which
he
knows
nor
so
long
as
these
agree
can
he
think
that
a
thing
which
he
knows
and
perceives
is
another
thing
which
he
perceives
or
that
a
thing
which
he
does
not
know
and
does
not
perceive
is
the
same
as
another
thing
which
he
does
not
know
and
does
not
perceive
nor
again
can
he
suppose
that
a
thing
which
he
does
not
know
and
does
not
perceive
is
the
same
as
another
thing
which
he
does
not
know
or
that
a
thing
which
he
does
not
know
and
does
not
perceive
is
another
thing
which
he
does
not
perceive
all
these
utterly
and
absolutely
exclude
the
possibility
of
false
opinion
the
only
cases
if
any
which
remain
are
the
following
theaetetus
what
are
they
if
you
tell
me
i
may
perhaps
understand
you
better
but
at
present
i
am
unable
to
follow
you
socrates
a
person
may
think
that
some
things
which
he
knows
or
which
he
perceives
and
does
not
know
are
some
other
things
which
he
knows
and
perceives
or
that
some
things
which
he
knows
and
perceives
are
other
things
which
he
knows
and
perceives
theaetetus
i
understand
you
less
than
ever
now
socrates
hear
me
once
more
then
i
knowing
theodorus
and
remembering
in
my
own
mind
what
sort
of
person
he
is
and
also
what
sort
of
person
theaetetus
is
at
one
time
see
them
and
at
another
time
do
not
see
them
and
sometimes
i
touch
them
and
at
another
time
not
or
at
one
time
i
may
hear
them
or
perceive
them
in
some
other
way
and
at
another
time
not
perceive
them
but
still
i
remember
them
and
know
them
in
my
own
mind
theaetetus
very
true
socrates
then
first
of
all
i
want
you
to
understand
that
a
man
may
or
may
not
perceive
sensibly
that
which
he
knows
theaetetus
true
socrates
and
that
which
he
does
not
know
will
sometimes
not
be
perceived
by
him
and
sometimes
will
be
perceived
and
only
perceived
theaetetus
that
is
also
true
socrates
see
whether
you
can
follow
me
better
now
socrates
can
recognize
theodorus
and
theaetetus
but
he
sees
neither
of
them
nor
does
he
perceive
them
in
any
other
way
he
can
not
then
by
any
possibility
imagine
in
his
own
mind
that
theaetetus
is
theodorus
am
i
not
right
theaetetus
you
are
quite
right
socrates
then
that
was
the
first
case
of
which
i
spoke
theaetetus
yes
socrates
the
second
case
was
that
i
knowing
one
of
you
and
not
knowing
the
other
and
perceiving
neither
can
never
think
him
whom
i
know
to
be
him
whom
i
do
not
know
theaetetus
true
socrates
in
the
third
case
not
knowing
and
not
perceiving
either
of
you
i
can
not
think
that
one
of
you
whom
i
do
not
know
is
the
other
whom
i
do
not
know
i
need
not
again
go
over
the
catalogue
of
excluded
cases
in
which
i
can
not
form
a
false
opinion
about
you
and
theodorus
either
when
i
know
both
or
when
i
am
in
ignorance
of
both
or
when
i
know
one
and
not
the
other
and
the
same
of
perceiving
do
you
understand
me
theaetetus
i
do
socrates
the
only
possibility
of
erroneous
opinion
is
when
knowing
you
and
theodorus
and
having
on
the
waxen
block
the
impression
of
both
of
you
given
as
by
a
seal
but
seeing
you
imperfectly
and
at
a
distance
i
try
to
assign
the
right
impression
of
memory
to
the
right
visual
impression
and
to
fit
this
into
its
own
print
if
i
succeed
recognition
will
take
place
but
if
i
fail
and
transpose
them
putting
the
foot
into
the
wrong
shoe
that
is
to
say
putting
the
vision
of
either
of
you
on
to
the
wrong
impression
or
if
my
mind
like
the
sight
in
a
mirror
which
is
transferred
from
right
to
left
err
by
reason
of
some
similar
affection
then
and
false
opinion
ensues
theaetetus
yes
socrates
you
have
described
the
nature
of
opinion
with
wonderful
exactness
socrates
or
again
when
i
know
both
of
you
and
perceive
as
well
as
know
one
of
you
but
not
the
other
and
my
knowledge
of
him
does
not
accord
with
perception
that
was
the
case
put
by
me
just
now
which
you
did
not
understand
theaetetus
no
i
did
not
socrates
i
meant
to
say
that
when
a
person
knows
and
perceives
one
of
you
his
knowledge
coincides
with
his
perception
he
will
never
think
him
to
be
some
other
person
whom
he
knows
and
perceives
and
the
knowledge
of
whom
coincides
with
his
perception
for
that
also
was
a
case
supposed
theaetetus
true
socrates
but
there
was
an
omission
of
the
further
case
in
which
as
we
now
say
false
opinion
may
arise
when
knowing
both
and
seeing
or
having
some
other
sensible
perception
of
both
i
fail
in
holding
the
seal
over
against
the
corresponding
sensation
like
a
bad
archer
i
miss
and
fall
wide
of
the
mark
and
this
is
called
falsehood
theaetetus
yes
it
is
rightly
so
called
socrates
when
therefore
perception
is
present
to
one
of
the
seals
or
impressions
but
not
to
the
other
and
the
mind
fits
the
seal
of
the
absent
perception
on
the
one
which
is
present
in
any
case
of
this
sort
the
mind
is
deceived
in
a
word
if
our
view
is
sound
there
can
be
no
error
or
deception
about
things
which
a
man
does
not
know
and
has
never
perceived
but
only
in
things
which
are
known
and
perceived
in
these
alone
opinion
turns
and
twists
about
and
becomes
alternately
true
and
false
true
when
the
seals
and
impressions
of
sense
meet
straight
and
opposite
false
when
they
go
awry
and
crooked
theaetetus
and
is
not
that
socrates
nobly
said
socrates
nobly
yes
but
wait
a
little
and
hear
the
explanation
and
then
you
will
say
so
with
more
reason
for
to
think
truly
is
noble
and
to
be
deceived
is
base
theaetetus
undoubtedly
socrates
and
the
origin
of
truth
and
error
is
as
follows
when
the
wax
in
the
soul
of
any
one
is
deep
and
abundant
and
smooth
and
perfectly
tempered
then
the
impressions
which
pass
through
the
senses
and
sink
into
the
heart
of
the
soul
as
homer
says
in
a
parable
meaning
to
indicate
the
likeness
of
the
soul
to
wax
kerh
kerhos
these
i
say
being
pure
and
clear
and
having
a
sufficient
depth
of
wax
are
also
lasting
and
minds
such
as
these
easily
learn
and
easily
retain
and
are
not
liable
to
confusion
but
have
true
thoughts
for
they
have
plenty
of
room
and
having
clear
impressions
of
things
as
we
term
them
quickly
distribute
them
into
their
proper
places
on
the
block
and
such
men
are
called
wise
do
you
agree
theaetetus
entirely
socrates
but
when
the
heart
of
any
one
is
shaggy
a
quality
which
the
poet
commends
or
muddy
and
of
impure
wax
or
very
soft
or
very
hard
then
there
is
a
corresponding
defect
in
the
mind
the
soft
are
good
at
learning
but
apt
to
forget
and
the
hard
are
the
reverse
the
shaggy
and
rugged
and
gritty
or
those
who
have
an
admixture
of
earth
or
dung
in
their
composition
have
the
impressions
indistinct
as
also
the
hard
for
there
is
no
depth
in
them
and
the
soft
too
are
indistinct
for
their
impressions
are
easily
confused
and
effaced
yet
greater
is
the
indistinctness
when
they
are
all
jostled
together
in
a
little
soul
which
has
no
room
these
are
the
natures
which
have
false
opinion
for
when
they
see
or
hear
or
think
of
anything
they
are
slow
in
assigning
the
right
objects
to
the
right
impressions
in
their
stupidity
they
confuse
them
and
are
apt
to
see
and
hear
and
think
amiss
and
such
men
are
said
to
be
deceived
in
their
knowledge
of
objects
and
ignorant
theaetetus
no
man
socrates
can
say
anything
truer
than
that
socrates
then
now
we
may
admit
the
existence
of
false
opinion
in
us
theaetetus
certainly
socrates
and
of
true
opinion
also
theaetetus
yes
socrates
we
have
at
length
satisfactorily
proven
beyond
a
doubt
there
are
these
two
sorts
of
opinion
theaetetus
undoubtedly
socrates
alas
theaetetus
what
a
tiresome
creature
is
a
man
who
is
fond
of
talking
theaetetus
what
makes
you
say
so
socrates
because
i
am
disheartened
at
my
own
stupidity
and
tiresome
garrulity
for
what
other
term
will
describe
the
habit
of
a
man
who
is
always
arguing
on
all
sides
of
a
question
whose
dulness
can
not
be
convinced
and
who
will
never
leave
off
theaetetus
but
what
puts
you
out
of
heart
socrates
i
am
not
only
out
of
heart
but
in
positive
despair
for
i
do
not
know
what
to
answer
if
any
one
were
to
ask
me
o
socrates
have
you
indeed
discovered
that
false
opinion
arises
neither
in
the
comparison
of
perceptions
with
one
another
nor
yet
in
thought
but
in
union
of
thought
and
perception
yes
i
shall
say
with
the
complacence
of
one
who
thinks
that
he
has
made
a
noble
discovery
theaetetus
i
see
no
reason
why
we
should
be
ashamed
of
our
demonstration
socrates
socrates
he
will
say
you
mean
to
argue
that
the
man
whom
we
only
think
of
and
do
not
see
can
not
be
confused
with
the
horse
which
we
do
not
see
or
touch
but
only
think
of
and
do
not
perceive
that
i
believe
to
be
my
meaning
i
shall
reply
theaetetus
quite
right
socrates
well
then
he
will
say
according
to
that
argument
the
number
eleven
which
is
only
thought
can
never
be
mistaken
for
twelve
which
is
only
thought
how
would
you
answer
him
theaetetus
i
should
say
that
a
mistake
may
very
likely
arise
between
the
eleven
or
twelve
which
are
seen
or
handled
but
that
no
similar
mistake
can
arise
between
the
eleven
and
twelve
which
are
in
the
mind
socrates
well
but
do
you
think
that
no
one
ever
put
before
his
own
mind
five
and
seven
i
do
not
mean
five
or
seven
men
or
horses
but
five
or
seven
in
the
abstract
which
as
we
say
are
recorded
on
the
waxen
block
and
in
which
false
opinion
is
held
to
be
impossible
did
no
man
ever
ask
himself
how
many
these
numbers
make
when
added
together
and
answer
that
they
are
eleven
while
another
thinks
that
they
are
twelve
or
would
all
agree
in
thinking
and
saying
that
they
are
twelve
theaetetus
certainly
not
many
would
think
that
they
are
eleven
and
in
the
higher
numbers
the
chance
of
error
is
greater
still
for
i
assume
you
to
be
speaking
of
numbers
in
general
socrates
exactly
and
i
want
you
to
consider
whether
this
does
not
imply
that
the
twelve
in
the
waxen
block
are
supposed
to
be
eleven
theaetetus
yes
that
seems
to
be
the
case
socrates
then
do
we
not
come
back
to
the
old
difficulty
for
he
who
makes
such
a
mistake
does
think
one
thing
which
he
knows
to
be
another
thing
which
he
knows
but
this
as
we
said
was
impossible
and
afforded
an
irresistible
proof
of
the
of
false
opinion
because
otherwise
the
same
person
would
inevitably
know
and
not
know
the
same
thing
at
the
same
time
theaetetus
most
true
socrates
then
false
opinion
can
not
be
explained
as
a
confusion
of
thought
and
sense
for
in
that
case
we
could
not
have
been
mistaken
about
pure
conceptions
of
thought
and
thus
we
are
obliged
to
say
either
that
false
opinion
does
not
exist
or
that
a
man
may
not
know
that
which
he
knows
which
alternative
do
you
prefer
theaetetus
it
is
hard
to
determine
socrates
socrates
and
yet
the
argument
will
scarcely
admit
of
both
but
as
we
are
at
our
wits
end
suppose
that
we
do
a
shameless
thing
theaetetus
what
is
it
socrates
let
us
attempt
to
explain
the
verb
know
theaetetus
and
why
should
that
be
shameless
socrates
you
seem
not
to
be
aware
that
the
whole
of
our
discussion
from
the
very
beginning
has
been
a
search
after
knowledge
of
which
we
are
assumed
not
to
know
the
nature
theaetetus
nay
but
i
am
well
aware
socrates
and
is
it
not
shameless
when
we
do
not
know
what
knowledge
is
to
be
explaining
the
verb
know
the
truth
is
theaetetus
that
we
have
long
been
infected
with
logical
impurity
thousands
of
times
have
we
repeated
the
words
know
and
not
know
and
have
or
have
not
science
or
knowledge
as
if
we
could
understand
what
we
are
saying
to
one
another
so
long
as
we
remain
ignorant
about
knowledge
and
at
this
moment
we
are
using
the
words
understand
are
ignorant
as
though
we
could
still
employ
them
when
deprived
of
knowledge
or
science
theaetetus
but
if
you
avoid
these
expressions
socrates
how
will
you
ever
argue
at
all
socrates
i
could
not
being
the
man
i
am
the
case
would
be
different
if
i
were
a
true
hero
of
dialectic
and
o
that
such
an
one
were
present
for
he
would
have
told
us
to
avoid
the
use
of
these
terms
at
the
same
time
he
would
not
have
spared
in
you
and
me
the
faults
which
i
have
noted
but
seeing
that
we
are
no
great
wits
shall
i
venture
to
say
what
knowing
is
for
i
think
that
the
attempt
may
be
worth
making
theaetetus
then
by
all
means
venture
and
no
one
shall
find
fault
with
you
for
using
the
forbidden
terms
socrates
you
have
heard
the
common
explanation
of
the
verb
know
theaetetus
i
think
so
but
i
do
not
remember
it
at
the
moment
socrates
they
explain
the
word
know
as
meaning
have
knowledge
theaetetus
true
socrates
i
should
like
to
make
a
slight
change
and
say
knowledge
theaetetus
how
do
the
two
expressions
differ
socrates
perhaps
there
may
be
no
difference
but
still
i
should
like
you
to
hear
my
view
that
you
may
help
me
to
test
it
theaetetus
i
will
if
i
can
socrates
i
should
distinguish
from
for
example
a
man
may
buy
and
keep
under
his
control
a
garment
which
he
does
not
wear
and
then
we
should
say
not
that
he
has
but
that
he
possesses
the
garment
theaetetus
it
would
be
the
correct
expression
socrates
well
may
not
a
man
and
yet
not
knowledge
in
the
sense
of
which
i
am
speaking
as
you
may
suppose
a
man
to
have
caught
wild
birds
doves
or
any
other
birds
and
to
be
keeping
them
in
an
aviary
which
he
has
constructed
at
home
we
might
say
of
him
in
one
sense
that
he
always
has
them
because
he
possesses
them
might
we
not
theaetetus
yes
socrates
and
yet
in
another
sense
he
has
none
of
them
but
they
are
in
his
power
and
he
has
got
them
under
his
hand
in
an
enclosure
of
his
own
and
can
take
and
have
them
whenever
he
likes
he
can
catch
any
which
he
likes
and
let
the
bird
go
again
and
he
may
do
so
as
often
as
he
pleases
theaetetus
true
socrates
once
more
then
as
in
what
preceded
we
made
a
sort
of
waxen
figment
in
the
mind
so
let
us
now
suppose
that
in
the
mind
of
each
man
there
is
an
aviary
of
all
sorts
of
birds
some
flocking
together
apart
from
the
rest
others
in
small
groups
others
solitary
flying
anywhere
and
everywhere
theaetetus
let
us
imagine
such
an
aviary
and
what
is
to
follow
socrates
we
may
suppose
that
the
birds
are
kinds
of
knowledge
and
that
when
we
were
children
this
receptacle
was
empty
whenever
a
man
has
gotten
and
detained
in
the
enclosure
a
kind
of
knowledge
he
may
be
said
to
have
learned
or
discovered
the
thing
which
is
the
subject
of
the
knowledge
and
this
is
to
know
theaetetus
granted
socrates
and
further
when
any
one
wishes
to
catch
any
of
these
knowledges
or
sciences
and
having
taken
to
hold
it
and
again
to
let
them
go
how
will
he
express
himself
will
he
describe
the
of
them
and
the
original
in
the
same
words
i
will
make
my
meaning
clearer
by
an
example
you
admit
that
there
is
an
art
of
arithmetic
theaetetus
to
be
sure
socrates
conceive
this
under
the
form
of
a
hunt
after
the
science
of
odd
and
even
in
general
theaetetus
i
follow
socrates
having
the
use
of
the
art
the
arithmetician
if
i
am
not
mistaken
has
the
conceptions
of
number
under
his
hand
and
can
transmit
them
to
another
theaetetus
yes
socrates
and
when
transmitting
them
he
may
be
said
to
teach
them
and
when
receiving
to
learn
them
and
when
receiving
to
learn
them
and
when
having
them
in
possession
in
the
aforesaid
aviary
he
may
be
said
to
know
them
theaetetus
exactly
socrates
attend
to
what
follows
must
not
the
perfect
arithmetician
know
all
numbers
for
he
has
the
science
of
all
numbers
in
his
mind
theaetetus
true
socrates
and
he
can
reckon
abstract
numbers
in
his
head
or
things
about
him
which
are
numerable
theaetetus
of
course
he
can
socrates
and
to
reckon
is
simply
to
consider
how
much
such
and
such
a
number
amounts
to
theaetetus
very
true
socrates
and
so
he
appears
to
be
searching
into
something
which
he
knows
as
if
he
did
not
know
it
for
we
have
already
admitted
that
he
knows
all
numbers
you
have
heard
these
perplexing
questions
raised
theaetetus
i
have
socrates
may
we
not
pursue
the
image
of
the
doves
and
say
that
the
chase
after
knowledge
is
of
two
kinds
one
kind
is
prior
to
possession
and
for
the
sake
of
possession
and
the
other
for
the
sake
of
taking
and
holding
in
the
hands
that
which
is
possessed
already
and
thus
when
a
man
has
learned
and
known
something
long
ago
he
may
resume
and
get
hold
of
the
knowledge
which
he
has
long
possessed
but
has
not
at
hand
in
his
mind
theaetetus
true
socrates
that
was
my
reason
for
asking
how
we
ought
to
speak
when
an
arithmetician
sets
about
numbering
or
a
grammarian
about
reading
shall
we
say
that
although
he
knows
he
comes
back
to
himself
to
learn
what
he
already
knows
theaetetus
it
would
be
too
absurd
socrates
socrates
shall
we
say
then
that
he
is
going
to
read
or
number
what
he
does
not
know
although
we
have
admitted
that
he
knows
all
letters
and
all
numbers
theaetetus
that
again
would
be
an
absurdity
socrates
then
shall
we
say
that
about
names
we
care
nothing
any
one
may
twist
and
turn
the
words
and
in
any
way
which
he
likes
but
since
we
have
determined
that
the
possession
of
knowledge
is
not
the
having
or
using
it
we
do
assert
that
a
man
can
not
not
possess
that
which
he
possesses
and
therefore
in
no
case
can
a
man
not
know
that
which
he
knows
but
he
may
get
a
false
opinion
about
it
for
he
may
have
the
knowledge
not
of
this
particular
thing
but
of
some
other
when
the
various
numbers
and
forms
of
knowledge
are
flying
about
in
the
aviary
and
wishing
to
capture
a
certain
sort
of
knowledge
out
of
the
general
store
he
takes
the
wrong
one
by
mistake
that
is
to
say
when
he
thought
eleven
to
be
twelve
he
got
hold
of
the
which
he
had
in
his
mind
when
he
wanted
the
pigeon
theaetetus
a
very
rational
explanation
socrates
but
when
he
catches
the
one
which
he
wants
then
he
is
not
deceived
and
has
an
opinion
of
what
is
and
thus
false
and
true
opinion
may
exist
and
the
difficulties
which
were
previously
raised
disappear
i
dare
say
that
you
agree
with
me
do
you
not
theaetetus
yes
socrates
and
so
we
are
rid
of
the
difficulty
of
a
man
not
knowing
what
he
knows
for
we
are
not
driven
to
the
inference
that
he
does
not
possess
what
he
possesses
whether
he
be
or
be
not
deceived
and
yet
i
fear
that
a
greater
difficulty
is
looking
in
at
the
window
theaetetus
what
is
it
socrates
how
can
the
exchange
of
one
knowledge
for
another
ever
become
false
opinion
theaetetus
what
do
you
mean
socrates
in
the
first
place
how
can
a
man
who
has
the
knowledge
of
anything
be
ignorant
of
that
which
he
knows
not
by
reason
of
ignorance
but
by
reason
of
his
own
knowledge
and
again
is
it
not
an
extreme
absurdity
that
he
should
suppose
another
thing
to
be
this
and
this
to
be
another
thing
that
having
knowledge
present
with
him
in
his
mind
he
should
still
know
nothing
and
be
ignorant
of
all
things
you
might
as
well
argue
that
ignorance
may
make
a
man
know
and
blindness
make
him
see
as
that
knowledge
can
make
him
ignorant
theaetetus
perhaps
socrates
we
may
have
been
wrong
in
making
only
forms
of
knowledge
our
birds
whereas
there
ought
to
have
been
forms
of
ignorance
as
well
flying
about
together
in
the
mind
and
then
he
who
sought
to
take
one
of
them
might
sometimes
catch
a
form
of
knowledge
and
sometimes
a
form
of
ignorance
and
thus
he
would
have
a
false
opinion
from
ignorance
but
a
true
one
from
knowledge
about
the
same
thing
socrates
i
can
not
help
praising
you
theaetetus
and
yet
i
must
beg
you
to
reconsider
your
words
let
us
grant
what
you
say
then
according
to
you
he
who
takes
ignorance
will
have
a
false
opinion
am
i
right
theaetetus
yes
socrates
he
will
certainly
not
think
that
he
has
a
false
opinion
theaetetus
of
course
not
socrates
he
will
think
that
his
opinion
is
true
and
he
will
fancy
that
he
knows
the
things
about
which
he
has
been
deceived
theaetetus
certainly
socrates
then
he
will
think
that
he
has
captured
knowledge
and
not
ignorance
theaetetus
clearly
socrates
and
thus
after
going
a
long
way
round
we
are
once
more
face
to
face
with
our
original
difficulty
the
hero
of
dialectic
will
retort
upon
us
my
excellent
friends
he
will
say
laughing
if
a
man
knows
the
form
of
ignorance
and
the
form
of
knowledge
can
he
think
that
one
of
them
which
he
knows
is
the
other
which
he
knows
or
if
he
knows
neither
of
them
can
he
think
that
the
one
which
he
knows
not
is
another
which
he
knows
not
or
if
he
knows
one
and
not
the
other
can
he
think
the
one
which
he
knows
to
be
the
one
which
he
does
not
know
or
the
one
which
he
does
not
know
to
be
the
one
which
he
knows
or
will
you
tell
me
that
there
are
other
forms
of
knowledge
which
distinguish
the
right
and
wrong
birds
and
which
the
owner
keeps
in
some
other
aviaries
or
graven
on
waxen
blocks
according
to
your
foolish
images
and
which
he
may
be
said
to
know
while
he
possesses
them
even
though
he
have
them
not
at
hand
in
his
mind
and
thus
in
a
perpetual
circle
you
will
be
compelled
to
go
round
and
round
and
you
will
make
no
progress
what
are
we
to
say
in
reply
theaetetus
theaetetus
indeed
socrates
i
do
not
know
what
we
are
to
say
socrates
are
not
his
reproaches
just
and
does
not
the
argument
truly
show
that
we
are
wrong
in
seeking
for
false
opinion
until
we
know
what
knowledge
is
that
must
be
first
ascertained
then
the
nature
of
false
opinion
theaetetus
i
can
not
but
agree
with
you
socrates
so
far
as
we
have
yet
gone
socrates
then
once
more
what
shall
we
say
that
knowledge
is
for
we
are
not
going
to
lose
heart
as
yet
theaetetus
certainly
i
shall
not
lose
heart
if
you
do
not
socrates
what
definition
will
be
most
consistent
with
our
former
views
theaetetus
i
can
not
think
of
any
but
our
old
one
socrates
socrates
what
was
it
theaetetus
knowledge
was
said
by
us
to
be
true
opinion
and
true
opinion
is
surely
unerring
and
the
results
which
follow
from
it
are
all
noble
and
good
socrates
he
who
led
the
way
into
the
river
theaetetus
said
experiment
will
show
and
perhaps
if
we
go
forward
in
the
search
we
may
stumble
upon
the
thing
which
we
are
looking
for
but
if
we
stay
where
we
are
nothing
will
come
to
light
theaetetus
very
true
let
us
go
forward
and
try
socrates
the
trail
soon
comes
to
an
end
for
a
whole
profession
is
against
us
theaetetus
how
is
that
and
what
profession
do
you
mean
socrates
the
profession
of
the
great
wise
ones
who
are
called
orators
and
lawyers
for
these
persuade
men
by
their
art
and
make
them
think
whatever
they
like
but
they
do
not
teach
them
do
you
imagine
that
there
are
any
teachers
in
the
world
so
clever
as
to
be
able
to
convince
others
of
the
truth
about
acts
of
robbery
or
violence
of
which
they
were
not
while
a
little
water
is
flowing
in
the
clepsydra
theaetetus
certainly
not
they
can
only
persuade
them
socrates
and
would
you
not
say
that
persuading
them
is
making
them
have
an
opinion
theaetetus
to
be
sure
socrates
when
therefore
judges
are
justly
persuaded
about
matters
which
you
can
know
only
by
seeing
them
and
not
in
any
other
way
and
when
thus
judging
of
them
from
report
they
attain
a
true
opinion
about
them
they
judge
without
knowledge
and
yet
are
rightly
persuaded
if
they
have
judged
well
theaetetus
certainly
socrates
and
yet
o
my
friend
if
true
opinion
in
law
courts
and
knowledge
are
the
same
the
perfect
judge
could
not
have
judged
rightly
without
knowledge
and
therefore
i
must
infer
that
they
are
not
the
same
theaetetus
that
is
a
distinction
socrates
which
i
have
heard
made
by
some
one
else
but
i
had
forgotten
it
he
said
that
true
opinion
combined
with
reason
was
knowledge
but
that
the
opinion
which
had
no
reason
was
out
of
the
sphere
of
knowledge
and
that
things
of
which
there
is
no
rational
account
are
not
knowable
such
was
the
singular
expression
which
he
used
and
that
things
which
have
a
reason
or
explanation
are
knowable
socrates
excellent
but
then
how
did
he
distinguish
between
things
which
are
and
are
not
i
wish
that
you
would
repeat
to
me
what
he
said
and
then
i
shall
know
whether
you
and
i
have
heard
the
same
tale
theaetetus
i
do
not
know
whether
i
can
recall
it
but
if
another
person
would
tell
me
i
think
that
i
could
follow
him
socrates
let
me
give
you
then
a
dream
in
return
for
a
dream
methought
that
i
too
had
a
dream
and
i
heard
in
my
dream
that
the
primeval
letters
or
elements
out
of
which
you
and
i
and
all
other
things
are
compounded
have
no
reason
or
explanation
you
can
only
name
them
but
no
predicate
can
be
either
affirmed
or
denied
of
them
for
in
the
one
case
existence
in
the
other
is
already
implied
neither
of
which
must
be
added
if
you
mean
to
speak
of
this
or
that
thing
by
itself
alone
it
should
not
be
called
itself
or
that
or
each
or
alone
or
this
or
the
like
for
these
go
about
everywhere
and
are
applied
to
all
things
but
are
distinct
from
them
whereas
if
the
first
elements
could
be
described
and
had
a
definition
of
their
own
they
would
be
spoken
of
apart
from
all
else
but
none
of
these
primeval
elements
can
be
defined
they
can
only
be
named
for
they
have
nothing
but
a
name
and
the
things
which
are
compounded
of
them
as
they
are
complex
are
expressed
by
a
combination
of
names
for
the
combination
of
names
is
the
essence
of
a
definition
thus
then
the
elements
or
letters
are
only
objects
of
perception
and
can
not
be
defined
or
known
but
the
syllables
or
combinations
of
them
are
known
and
expressed
and
are
apprehended
by
true
opinion
when
therefore
any
one
forms
the
true
opinion
of
anything
without
rational
explanation
you
may
say
that
his
mind
is
truly
exercised
but
has
no
knowledge
for
he
who
can
not
give
and
receive
a
reason
for
a
thing
has
no
knowledge
of
that
thing
but
when
he
adds
rational
explanation
then
he
is
perfected
in
knowledge
and
may
be
all
that
i
have
been
denying
of
him
was
that
the
form
in
which
the
dream
appeared
to
you
theaetetus
precisely
socrates
and
you
allow
and
maintain
that
true
opinion
combined
with
definition
or
rational
explanation
is
knowledge
theaetetus
exactly
socrates
then
may
we
assume
theaetetus
that
and
in
this
casual
manner
we
have
found
a
truth
which
in
former
times
many
wise
men
have
grown
old
and
have
not
found
theaetetus
at
any
rate
socrates
i
am
satisfied
with
the
present
statement
socrates
which
is
probably
correct
for
how
can
there
be
knowledge
apart
from
definition
and
true
opinion
and
yet
there
is
one
point
in
what
has
been
said
which
does
not
quite
satisfy
me
theaetetus
what
was
it
socrates
what
might
seem
to
be
the
most
ingenious
notion
of
all
that
the
elements
or
letters
are
unknown
but
the
combination
or
syllables
known
theaetetus
and
was
that
wrong
socrates
we
shall
soon
know
for
we
have
as
hostages
the
instances
which
the
author
of
the
argument
himself
used
theaetetus
what
hostages
socrates
the
letters
which
are
the
clements
and
the
syllables
which
are
the
combinations
he
reasoned
did
he
not
from
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
theaetetus
yes
he
did
socrates
let
us
take
them
and
put
them
to
the
test
or
rather
test
ourselves
what
was
the
way
in
which
we
learned
letters
and
first
of
all
are
we
right
in
saying
that
syllables
have
a
definition
but
that
letters
have
no
definition
theaetetus
i
think
so
socrates
i
think
so
too
for
suppose
that
some
one
asks
you
to
spell
the
first
syllable
of
my
name
theaetetus
he
says
what
is
so
theaetetus
i
should
reply
s
and
socrates
that
is
the
definition
which
you
would
give
of
the
syllable
theaetetus
i
should
socrates
i
wish
that
you
would
give
me
a
similar
definition
of
the
theaetetus
but
how
can
any
one
socrates
tell
the
elements
of
an
element
i
can
only
reply
that
s
is
a
consonant
a
mere
noise
as
of
the
tongue
hissing
b
and
most
other
letters
again
are
neither
nor
noises
thus
letters
may
be
most
truly
said
to
be
undefined
for
even
the
most
distinct
of
them
which
are
the
seven
vowels
have
a
sound
only
but
no
definition
at
all
socrates
then
i
suppose
my
friend
that
we
have
been
so
far
right
in
our
idea
about
knowledge
theaetetus
yes
i
think
that
we
have
socrates
well
but
have
we
been
right
in
maintaining
that
the
syllables
can
be
known
but
not
the
letters
theaetetus
i
think
so
socrates
and
do
we
mean
by
a
syllable
two
letters
or
if
there
are
more
all
of
them
or
a
single
idea
which
arises
out
of
the
combination
of
them
theaetetus
i
should
say
that
we
mean
all
the
letters
socrates
take
the
case
of
the
two
letters
s
and
o
which
form
the
first
syllable
of
my
own
name
must
not
he
who
knows
the
syllable
know
both
of
them
theaetetus
certainly
socrates
he
knows
that
is
the
s
and
o
theaetetus
yes
socrates
but
can
he
be
ignorant
of
either
singly
and
yet
know
both
together
theaetetus
such
a
supposition
socrates
is
monstrous
and
unmeaning
socrates
but
if
he
can
not
know
both
without
knowing
each
then
if
he
is
ever
to
know
the
syllable
he
must
know
the
letters
first
and
thus
the
fine
theory
has
again
taken
wings
and
departed
theaetetus
yes
with
wonderful
celerity
socrates
yes
we
did
not
keep
watch
properly
perhaps
we
ought
to
have
maintained
that
a
syllable
is
not
the
letters
but
rather
one
single
idea
framed
out
of
them
having
a
separate
form
distinct
from
them
theaetetus
very
true
and
a
more
likely
notion
than
the
other
socrates
take
care
let
us
not
be
cowards
and
betray
a
great
and
imposing
theory
theaetetus
no
indeed
socrates
let
us
assume
then
as
we
now
say
that
the
syllable
is
a
simple
form
arising
out
of
the
several
combinations
of
harmonious
elements
of
letters
or
of
any
other
elements
theaetetus
very
good
socrates
and
it
must
have
no
parts
theaetetus
why
socrates
because
that
which
has
parts
must
be
a
whole
of
all
the
parts
or
would
you
say
that
a
whole
although
formed
out
of
the
parts
is
a
single
notion
different
from
all
the
parts
theaetetus
i
should
socrates
and
would
you
say
that
all
and
the
whole
are
the
same
or
different
theaetetus
i
am
not
certain
but
as
you
like
me
to
answer
at
once
i
shall
hazard
the
reply
that
they
are
different
socrates
i
approve
of
your
readiness
theaetetus
but
i
must
take
time
to
think
whether
i
equally
approve
of
your
answer
theaetetus
yes
the
answer
is
the
point
socrates
according
to
this
new
view
the
whole
is
supposed
to
differ
from
all
theaetetus
yes
socrates
well
but
is
there
any
difference
between
all
in
the
plural
and
the
all
in
the
singular
take
the
case
of
number
when
we
say
one
two
three
four
five
six
or
when
we
say
twice
three
or
three
times
two
or
four
and
two
or
three
and
two
and
one
are
we
speaking
of
the
same
or
of
different
numbers
theaetetus
of
the
same
socrates
that
is
of
six
theaetetus
yes
socrates
and
in
each
form
of
expression
we
spoke
of
all
the
six
theaetetus
true
socrates
again
in
speaking
of
all
in
the
plural
is
there
not
one
thing
which
we
express
theaetetus
of
course
there
is
socrates
and
that
is
six
theaetetus
yes
socrates
then
in
predicating
the
word
of
things
measured
by
number
we
predicate
at
the
same
time
a
singular
and
a
plural
theaetetus
clearly
we
do
socrates
again
the
number
of
the
acre
and
the
acre
are
the
same
are
they
not
theaetetus
yes
socrates
and
the
number
of
the
stadium
in
like
manner
is
the
stadium
theaetetus
yes
socrates
and
the
army
is
the
number
of
the
army
and
in
all
similar
cases
the
entire
number
of
anything
is
the
entire
thing
theaetetus
true
socrates
and
the
number
of
each
is
the
parts
of
each
theaetetus
exactly
socrates
then
as
many
things
as
have
parts
are
made
up
of
parts
theaetetus
clearly
socrates
but
all
the
parts
are
admitted
to
be
the
all
if
the
entire
number
is
the
all
theaetetus
true
socrates
then
the
whole
is
not
made
up
of
parts
for
it
would
be
the
all
if
consisting
of
all
the
parts
theaetetus
that
is
the
inference
socrates
but
is
a
part
a
part
of
anything
but
the
whole
theaetetus
yes
of
the
all
socrates
you
make
a
valiant
defence
theaetetus
and
yet
is
not
the
all
that
of
which
nothing
is
wanting
theaetetus
certainly
socrates
and
is
not
a
whole
likewise
that
from
which
nothing
is
absent
but
that
from
which
anything
is
absent
is
neither
a
whole
nor
all
if
wanting
in
anything
both
equally
lose
their
entirety
of
nature
theaetetus
i
now
think
that
there
is
no
difference
between
a
whole
and
all
socrates
but
were
we
not
saying
that
when
a
thing
has
parts
all
the
parts
will
be
a
whole
and
all
theaetetus
certainly
socrates
then
as
i
was
saying
before
must
not
the
alternative
be
that
either
the
syllable
is
not
the
letters
and
then
the
letters
are
not
parts
of
the
syllable
or
that
the
syllable
will
be
the
same
with
the
letters
and
will
therefore
be
equally
known
with
them
theaetetus
you
are
right
socrates
and
in
order
to
avoid
this
we
suppose
it
to
be
different
from
them
theaetetus
yes
socrates
but
if
letters
are
not
parts
of
syllables
can
you
tell
me
of
any
other
parts
of
syllables
which
are
not
letters
theaetetus
no
indeed
socrates
for
if
i
admit
the
existence
of
parts
in
a
syllable
it
would
be
ridiculous
in
me
to
give
up
letters
and
seek
for
other
parts
socrates
quite
true
theaetetus
and
therefore
according
to
our
present
view
a
syllable
must
surely
be
some
indivisible
form
theaetetus
true
socrates
but
do
you
remember
my
friend
that
only
a
little
while
ago
we
admitted
and
approved
the
statement
that
of
the
first
elements
out
of
which
all
other
things
are
compounded
there
could
be
no
definition
because
each
of
them
when
taken
by
itself
is
uncompounded
nor
can
one
rightly
attribute
to
them
the
words
or
because
they
are
alien
and
inappropriate
words
and
for
this
reason
the
letters
or
elements
were
indefinable
and
unknown
theaetetus
i
remember
socrates
and
is
not
this
also
the
reason
why
they
are
simple
and
indivisible
i
can
see
no
other
theaetetus
no
other
reason
can
be
given
socrates
then
is
not
the
syllable
in
the
same
case
as
the
elements
or
letters
if
it
has
no
parts
and
is
one
form
theaetetus
to
be
sure
socrates
if
then
a
syllable
is
a
whole
and
has
many
parts
or
letters
the
letters
as
well
as
the
syllable
must
be
intelligible
and
expressible
since
all
the
parts
are
acknowledged
to
be
the
same
as
the
whole
theaetetus
true
socrates
but
if
it
be
one
and
indivisible
then
the
syllables
and
the
letters
are
alike
undefined
and
unknown
and
for
the
same
reason
theaetetus
i
can
not
deny
that
socrates
we
can
not
therefore
agree
in
the
opinion
of
him
who
says
that
the
syllable
can
be
known
and
expressed
but
not
the
letters
theaetetus
certainly
not
if
we
may
trust
the
argument
socrates
well
but
will
you
not
be
equally
inclined
to
disagree
with
him
when
you
remember
your
own
experience
in
learning
to
read
theaetetus
what
experience
socrates
why
that
in
learning
you
were
kept
trying
to
distinguish
the
separate
letters
both
by
the
eye
and
by
the
ear
in
order
that
when
you
heard
them
spoken
or
saw
them
written
you
might
not
be
confused
by
their
position
theaetetus
very
true
socrates
and
is
the
education
of
the
complete
unless
he
can
tell
what
string
answers
to
a
particular
note
the
notes
as
every
one
would
allow
are
the
elements
or
letters
of
music
theaetetus
exactly
socrates
then
if
we
argue
from
the
letters
and
syllables
which
we
know
to
other
simples
and
compounds
we
shall
say
that
the
letters
or
simple
elements
as
a
class
are
much
more
certainly
known
than
the
syllables
and
much
more
indispensable
to
a
perfect
knowledge
of
any
subject
and
if
some
one
says
that
the
syllable
is
known
and
the
letter
unknown
we
shall
consider
that
either
intentionally
or
unintentionally
he
is
talking
nonsense
theaetetus
exactly
socrates
and
there
might
be
given
other
proofs
of
this
belief
if
i
am
not
mistaken
but
do
not
let
us
in
looking
for
them
lose
sight
of
the
question
before
us
which
is
the
meaning
of
the
statement
that
right
opinion
with
rational
definition
or
explanation
is
the
most
perfect
form
of
knowledge
theaetetus
we
must
not
socrates
well
and
what
is
the
meaning
of
the
term
i
think
that
we
have
a
choice
of
three
meanings
theaetetus
what
are
they
socrates
in
the
first
place
the
meaning
may
be
manifesting
thought
by
the
voice
with
verbs
and
nouns
imaging
an
opinion
in
the
stream
which
flows
from
the
lips
as
in
a
mirror
or
water
does
not
explanation
appear
to
be
of
this
nature
theaetetus
certainly
he
who
so
manifests
his
thought
is
said
to
explain
himself
socrates
and
every
one
who
is
not
born
deaf
or
dumb
is
able
sooner
or
later
to
manifest
what
he
thinks
of
anything
and
if
so
all
those
who
have
a
right
opinion
about
anything
will
also
have
right
explanation
nor
will
right
opinion
be
anywhere
found
to
exist
apart
from
knowledge
theaetetus
true
socrates
let
us
not
therefore
hastily
charge
him
who
gave
this
account
of
knowledge
with
uttering
an
unmeaning
word
for
perhaps
he
only
intended
to
say
that
when
a
person
was
asked
what
was
the
nature
of
anything
he
should
be
able
to
answer
his
questioner
by
giving
the
elements
of
the
thing
theaetetus
as
for
example
socrates
socrates
as
for
example
when
hesiod
says
that
a
waggon
is
made
up
of
a
hundred
planks
now
neither
you
nor
i
could
describe
all
of
them
individually
but
if
any
one
asked
what
is
a
waggon
we
should
be
content
to
answer
that
a
waggon
consists
of
wheels
axle
body
rims
yoke
theaetetus
certainly
socrates
and
our
opponent
will
probably
laugh
at
us
just
as
he
would
if
we
professed
to
be
grammarians
and
to
give
a
grammatical
account
of
the
name
of
theaetetus
and
yet
could
only
tell
the
syllables
and
not
the
letters
of
your
name
that
would
be
true
opinion
and
not
knowledge
for
knowledge
as
has
been
already
remarked
is
not
attained
until
combined
with
true
opinion
there
is
an
enumeration
of
the
elements
out
of
which
anything
is
composed
theaetetus
yes
socrates
in
the
same
general
way
we
might
also
have
true
opinion
about
a
waggon
but
he
who
can
describe
its
essence
by
an
enumeration
of
the
hundred
planks
adds
rational
explanation
to
true
opinion
and
instead
of
opinion
has
art
and
knowledge
of
the
nature
of
a
waggon
in
that
he
attains
to
the
whole
through
the
elements
theaetetus
and
do
you
not
agree
in
that
view
socrates
socrates
if
you
do
my
friend
but
i
want
to
know
first
whether
you
admit
the
resolution
of
all
things
into
their
elements
to
be
a
rational
explanation
of
them
and
the
consideration
of
them
in
syllables
or
larger
combinations
of
them
to
be
irrational
is
this
your
view
theaetetus
precisely
socrates
well
and
do
you
conceive
that
a
man
has
knowledge
of
any
element
who
at
one
time
affirms
and
at
another
time
denies
that
element
of
something
or
thinks
that
the
same
thing
is
composed
of
different
elements
at
different
times
theaetetus
assuredly
not
socrates
and
do
you
not
remember
that
in
your
case
and
in
that
of
others
this
often
occurred
in
the
process
of
learning
to
read
theaetetus
you
mean
that
i
mistook
the
letters
and
misspelt
the
syllables
socrates
yes
theaetetus
to
be
sure
i
perfectly
remember
and
i
am
very
far
from
supposing
that
they
who
are
in
this
condition
have
knowledge
socrates
when
a
person
at
the
time
of
learning
writes
the
name
of
theaetetus
and
thinks
that
he
ought
to
write
and
does
write
th
and
e
but
again
meaning
to
write
the
name
of
theododorus
thinks
that
he
ought
to
write
and
does
write
t
and
e
can
we
suppose
that
he
knows
the
first
syllables
of
your
two
names
theaetetus
we
have
already
admitted
that
such
a
one
has
not
yet
attained
knowledge
socrates
and
in
like
manner
be
may
enumerate
without
knowing
them
the
second
and
third
and
fourth
syllables
of
your
name
theaetetus
he
may
socrates
and
in
that
case
when
he
knows
the
order
of
the
letters
and
can
write
them
out
correctly
he
has
right
opinion
theaetetus
clearly
socrates
but
although
we
admit
that
he
has
right
opinion
he
will
still
be
without
knowledge
theaetetus
yes
socrates
and
yet
he
will
have
explanation
as
well
as
right
opinion
for
he
knew
the
order
of
the
letters
when
he
wrote
and
this
we
admit
to
be
explanation
theaetetus
true
socrates
then
my
friend
there
is
such
a
thing
as
right
opinion
united
with
definition
or
explanation
which
does
not
as
yet
attain
to
the
exactness
of
knowledge
theaetetus
it
would
seem
so
socrates
and
what
we
fancied
to
be
a
perfect
definition
of
knowledge
is
a
dream
only
but
perhaps
we
had
better
not
say
so
as
yet
for
were
there
not
three
explanations
of
knowledge
one
of
which
must
as
we
said
be
adopted
by
him
who
maintains
knowledge
to
be
true
opinion
combined
with
rational
explanation
and
very
likely
there
may
be
found
some
one
who
will
not
prefer
this
but
the
third
theaetetus
you
are
quite
right
there
is
still
one
remaining
the
first
was
the
image
or
expression
of
the
mind
in
speech
the
second
which
has
just
been
mentioned
is
a
way
of
reaching
the
whole
by
an
enumeration
of
the
elements
but
what
is
the
third
definition
socrates
there
is
further
the
popular
notion
of
telling
the
mark
or
sign
of
difference
which
distinguishes
the
thing
in
question
from
all
others
theaetetus
can
you
give
me
any
example
of
such
a
definition
socrates
as
for
example
in
the
case
of
the
sun
i
think
that
you
would
be
contented
with
the
statement
that
the
sun
is
the
brightest
of
the
heavenly
bodies
which
revolve
about
the
earth
theaetetus
certainly
socrates
understand
why
the
reason
is
as
i
was
just
now
saying
that
if
you
get
at
the
difference
and
distinguishing
characteristic
of
each
thing
then
as
many
persons
affirm
you
will
get
at
the
definition
or
explanation
of
it
but
while
you
lay
hold
only
of
the
common
and
not
of
the
characteristic
notion
you
will
only
have
the
definition
of
those
things
to
which
this
common
quality
belongs
theaetetus
i
understand
you
and
your
account
of
definition
is
in
my
judgment
correct
socrates
but
he
who
having
right
opinion
about
anything
can
find
out
the
difference
which
distinguishes
it
from
other
things
will
know
that
of
which
before
he
had
only
an
opinion
theaetetus
yes
that
is
what
we
are
maintaining
socrates
nevertheless
theaetetus
on
a
nearer
view
i
find
myself
quite
disappointed
the
picture
which
at
a
distance
was
not
so
bad
has
now
become
altogether
unintelligible
theaetetus
what
do
you
mean
socrates
i
will
endeavour
to
explain
i
will
suppose
myself
to
have
true
opinion
of
you
and
if
to
this
i
add
your
definition
then
i
have
knowledge
but
if
not
opinion
only
theaetetus
yes
socrates
the
definition
was
assumed
to
be
the
interpretation
of
your
difference
theaetetus
true
socrates
but
when
i
had
only
opinion
i
had
no
conception
of
your
distinguishing
characteristics
theaetetus
i
suppose
not
socrates
then
i
must
have
conceived
of
some
general
or
common
nature
which
no
more
belonged
to
you
than
to
another
theaetetus
true
socrates
tell
me
now
how
in
that
case
could
i
have
formed
a
judgment
of
you
any
more
than
of
any
one
else
suppose
that
i
imagine
theaetetus
to
be
a
man
who
has
nose
eyes
and
mouth
and
every
other
member
complete
how
would
that
enable
me
to
distinguish
theaetetus
from
theodorus
or
from
some
outer
barbarian
theaetetus
how
could
it
socrates
or
if
i
had
further
conceived
of
you
not
only
as
having
nose
and
eyes
but
as
having
a
snub
nose
and
prominent
eyes
should
i
have
any
more
notion
of
you
than
of
myself
and
others
who
resemble
me
theaetetus
certainly
not
socrates
surely
i
can
have
no
conception
of
theaetetus
until
your
has
left
an
impression
on
my
mind
different
from
the
of
all
others
whom
i
have
ever
seen
and
until
your
other
peculiarities
have
a
like
distinctness
and
so
when
i
meet
you
the
right
opinion
will
be
theaetetus
most
true
socrates
then
right
opinion
implies
the
perception
of
differences
theaetetus
clearly
socrates
what
then
shall
we
say
of
adding
reason
or
explanation
to
right
opinion
if
the
meaning
is
that
we
should
form
an
opinion
of
the
way
in
which
something
differs
from
another
thing
the
proposal
is
ridiculous
theaetetus
how
so
socrates
we
are
supposed
to
acquire
a
right
opinion
of
the
differences
which
distinguish
one
thing
from
another
when
we
have
already
a
right
opinion
of
them
and
so
we
go
round
and
round
the
revolution
of
the
scytal
or
pestle
or
any
other
rotatory
machine
in
the
same
circles
is
as
nothing
compared
with
such
a
requirement
and
we
may
be
truly
described
as
the
blind
directing
the
blind
for
to
add
those
things
which
we
already
have
in
order
that
we
may
learn
what
we
already
think
is
like
a
soul
utterly
benighted
theaetetus
tell
me
what
were
you
going
to
say
just
now
when
you
asked
the
question
socrates
if
my
boy
the
argument
in
speaking
of
adding
the
definition
had
used
the
word
to
and
not
merely
an
opinion
of
the
difference
this
which
is
the
most
promising
of
all
the
definitions
of
knowledge
would
have
come
to
a
pretty
end
for
to
know
is
surely
to
acquire
knowledge
theaetetus
true
socrates
and
so
when
the
question
is
asked
what
is
knowledge
this
fair
argument
will
answer
opinion
with
knowledge
knowledge
that
is
of
difference
for
this
as
the
said
argument
maintains
is
adding
the
definition
theaetetus
that
seems
to
be
true
socrates
but
how
utterly
foolish
when
we
are
asking
what
is
knowledge
that
the
reply
should
only
be
right
opinion
with
knowledge
of
difference
or
of
anything
and
so
theaetetus
knowledge
is
neither
sensation
nor
true
opinion
nor
yet
definition
and
explanation
accompanying
and
added
to
true
opinion
theaetetus
i
suppose
not
socrates
and
are
you
still
in
labour
and
travail
my
dear
friend
or
have
you
brought
all
that
you
have
to
say
about
knowledge
to
the
birth
theaetetus
i
am
sure
socrates
that
you
have
elicited
from
me
a
good
deal
more
than
ever
was
in
me
socrates
and
does
not
my
art
show
that
you
have
brought
forth
wind
and
that
the
offspring
of
your
brain
are
not
worth
bringing
up
theaetetus
very
true
socrates
but
if
theaetetus
you
should
ever
conceive
afresh
you
will
be
all
the
better
for
the
present
investigation
and
if
not
you
will
be
soberer
and
humbler
and
gentler
to
other
men
and
will
be
too
modest
to
fancy
that
you
know
what
you
do
not
know
these
are
the
limits
of
my
art
i
can
no
further
go
nor
do
i
know
aught
of
the
things
which
great
and
famous
men
know
or
have
known
in
this
or
former
ages
the
office
of
a
midwife
i
like
my
mother
have
received
from
god
she
delivered
women
i
deliver
men
but
they
must
be
young
and
noble
and
fair
and
now
i
have
to
go
to
the
porch
of
the
king
archon
where
i
am
to
meet
meletus
and
his
indictment
morning
theodorus
i
shall
hope
to
see
you
again
at
this
place
