the
game
of
consequences
the
firelight
flickered
on
the
nursery
wall
and
the
children
sat
round
the
table
learning
the
new
game
which
the
said
they
would
like
ever
so
directly
they
understood
it
i
understand
it
already
said
alex
the
eldest
tossing
her
head
proudly
look
barbara
you
fold
the
piece
of
paper
like
this
and
then
give
it
to
cedric
because
he
next
to
you
and
i
give
mine
to
you
and
emily
gives
hers
to
me
that
right
is
it
emily
quite
right
miss
alex
what
a
clever
girl
to
be
sure
here
master
baby
you
can
play
with
me
you
too
little
to
do
it
all
by
yourself
he
is
baby
any
more
we
got
to
call
him
archie
now
the
new
little
sister
is
baby
said
alex
dictatorially
she
liked
always
to
be
the
one
to
give
information
and
emily
had
only
been
with
them
a
little
while
the
children
own
nurse
would
have
told
her
to
mind
her
own
business
or
to
wait
till
she
was
asked
before
teaching
her
grandmother
but
emily
said
complacently
to
be
sure
miss
alex
and
such
a
big
boy
as
master
archie
is
too
now
you
all
write
down
a
name
of
a
gentleman
what
gentleman
asked
cedric
judicially
he
was
a
little
boy
of
eight
with
serious
grey
eyes
and
a
good
deal
of
dignity
why
any
gentleman
some
one
you
all
know
i
know
i
know
alex
always
the
most
easily
excited
of
them
all
scribbled
on
her
piece
of
paper
and
began
to
bounce
up
and
down
on
her
chair
hurry
up
barbara
you
so
slow
i
do
know
who
to
put
alex
began
to
whisper
and
barbara
at
once
said
nurse
does
allow
us
to
whisper
it
bad
manners
you
horrid
little
prig
alex
was
furious
barbara
priggishness
always
put
her
into
a
temper
because
she
felt
it
unconsciously
to
be
a
reflection
on
her
own
infallibility
as
the
eldest
miss
barbara
said
emily
angrily
it
not
for
you
to
say
what
nurse
allows
or
does
allow
looking
after
you
now
the
idea
indeed
barbara
pale
pointed
little
face
grew
very
red
but
she
did
not
cry
as
alex
in
spite
of
her
twelve
years
would
almost
certainly
have
cried
at
such
a
snub
she
set
her
mouth
vindictively
and
shot
a
very
angry
look
at
alex
out
of
her
blue
eyes
then
she
wrote
something
on
the
slip
of
paper
shielding
it
with
her
hand
so
that
her
sister
could
not
read
it
cedric
was
printing
in
large
capitals
easily
legible
but
no
one
was
interested
in
what
cedric
wrote
there
was
a
good
deal
of
whispering
between
emily
and
little
archie
and
then
the
papers
were
folded
up
once
more
and
passed
round
the
table
again
but
when
do
we
see
what
we
written
asked
alex
impatiently
not
till
the
end
of
the
game
then
we
read
them
out
that
where
the
fun
comes
in
said
emily
it
was
a
long
while
before
the
papers
were
done
and
most
of
the
children
found
it
very
difficult
to
decide
what
said
to
what
she
replied
and
what
the
world
said
but
at
last
even
barbara
always
folded
her
slip
very
grimy
and
and
put
it
with
the
others
into
emily
apron
now
then
giggled
the
pull
one
out
master
archie
and
i
see
what
it
says
archie
snatched
at
a
paper
and
they
opened
it
listen
said
emily
the
queen
met
master
archie
whoever
of
you
put
the
queen
cedric
cried
the
other
children
cedric
loyalty
to
his
sovereign
was
a
in
the
nursery
well
the
queen
met
master
archie
in
the
park
she
said
to
him
and
he
answered
her
dirty
little
boy
go
and
wash
your
face
well
if
that
did
ought
to
be
the
other
way
round
i
wish
it
was
me
she
met
in
the
park
said
cedric
sombrely
i
might
have
gone
back
to
buckingham
palace
with
her
and
go
on
emily
go
on
cried
alex
impatiently
do
listen
to
cedric
what
comes
next
the
consequences
was
whatever
here
said
emily
pretending
an
inability
to
decipher
her
own
writing
well
i
never
the
consequences
was
a
whoever
went
and
thought
of
that
now
and
the
world
said
the
nursery
door
opened
and
alex
shrieked
oh
finish
it
quick
she
knew
instinctively
that
it
was
nurse
and
that
nurse
would
be
certain
to
disapprove
of
the
new
game
do
you
make
that
noise
alex
said
nurse
sharply
you
disturb
the
baby
with
your
screaming
for
a
moment
alex
wondered
if
the
game
was
to
be
allowed
to
proceed
but
barbara
well
known
to
be
nurse
favourite
must
needs
say
to
her
in
an
amiable
little
voice
such
as
she
never
used
to
her
brothers
and
sister
emily
been
teaching
us
such
a
funny
new
game
nurse
come
and
play
with
us
i
no
time
to
play
as
you
very
well
know
with
all
your
clothes
wanting
looking
over
the
way
they
do
nurse
told
her
complacently
what
the
game
alex
kicked
barbara
under
the
table
but
without
much
hope
and
at
the
same
moment
cedric
remarked
very
distinctly
it
is
called
consequences
and
archie
met
the
queen
in
the
park
i
wish
it
had
been
me
instead
well
exclaimed
nurse
that
the
way
you
do
when
my
back
turned
miss
emily
teaching
them
such
vulgar
nonsensical
games
as
that
never
did
i
hear
now
give
me
those
papers
this
minute
she
did
not
wait
to
be
given
anything
but
snatched
the
little
slips
out
of
emily
apron
and
threw
them
on
to
the
fire
i
not
going
to
have
no
consequences
in
nursery
and
do
you
believe
it
remarked
nurse
but
omnipotent
though
nurse
was
in
the
eyes
of
the
clare
children
she
could
not
altogether
compass
this
feat
there
were
consequences
of
all
sorts
cedric
who
was
obstinate
and
barbara
also
obstinate
and
rather
sly
as
well
continued
to
play
at
the
new
game
in
corners
by
themselves
refusing
to
admit
alex
to
their
society
because
she
told
them
that
they
were
playing
it
all
wrong
she
knew
that
they
were
not
playing
it
as
emily
had
taught
them
and
was
prepared
to
set
them
right
although
she
felt
uncertain
in
the
depths
of
her
heart
as
to
whether
she
herself
could
remember
it
all
but
at
least
she
knew
more
than
barbara
who
was
silly
and
a
or
than
cedric
who
had
concentrated
on
the
possibilities
the
game
presented
to
him
of
a
hypothetical
encounter
between
himself
and
his
sovereign
the
game
for
cedric
consisted
in
the
conversation
which
took
place
under
the
heading
of
what
he
said
to
her
and
what
she
replied
when
her
majesty
proceeded
under
cedric
laborious
pencil
to
invite
him
to
drive
her
in
her
own
to
buckingham
palace
alex
said
scornfully
that
cedric
was
a
silly
little
boy
and
of
course
the
queen
would
say
to
which
cedric
turned
a
perfectly
deaf
ear
and
continued
slowly
to
evolve
amenities
eminently
satisfactory
to
his
admiration
for
her
majesty
alex
went
away
shrugging
her
shoulders
but
secretly
she
knew
that
cedric
indifference
had
got
the
better
of
her
however
much
she
might
laugh
with
the
other
children
or
sometimes
even
in
a
superior
way
with
the
when
the
children
went
into
the
at
cedric
slowness
and
his
curious
fashion
of
harping
upon
one
idea
at
a
time
alex
was
aware
of
cedric
as
a
force
and
one
which
could
ultimately
always
defeat
her
own
diffused
unbalanced
energies
if
any
one
laughed
at
alex
or
despised
one
of
her
many
enthusiasms
she
would
quickly
grow
ashamed
of
it
and
try
to
pretend
that
she
had
never
really
been
in
earnest
in
the
same
way
she
would
affect
qualities
and
instincts
which
did
not
belong
to
her
with
the
hope
of
attracting
and
of
gaining
affection
but
cedric
went
his
own
way
as
genuinely
undisturbed
by
scoldings
and
hustlings
as
by
his
elder
sister
mockery
which
had
its
origin
in
her
secret
longing
to
prove
to
herself
in
spite
of
her
own
inmost
convictions
that
she
was
the
dominant
spirit
in
her
little
world
it
always
made
her
angry
when
cedric
left
her
gibes
unanswered
not
from
a
desire
to
provoke
her
further
but
simply
from
his
complete
absorption
in
the
matter
in
hand
and
his
utter
indifference
to
alex
comments
do
you
hear
what
i
say
alex
asked
sharply
no
said
cedric
baldly
i
not
listening
do
interrupt
me
alex
you
playing
it
all
wrong
you
and
barbara
two
silly
little
babies
she
cried
angrily
and
incoherently
and
it
a
stupid
vulgar
game
nurse
said
so
although
alex
had
been
the
most
enthusiastic
of
them
all
when
emily
had
first
taught
her
the
game
she
had
at
once
begun
to
think
it
vulgar
when
nurse
condemned
it
she
would
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
consequences
it
was
quite
likely
that
in
a
few
days
barbara
would
get
into
one
of
her
priggish
perverse
moods
and
in
a
fit
of
temper
with
cedric
go
and
tell
nurse
that
he
was
still
indulging
in
the
forbidden
pastime
alex
thought
she
might
as
well
be
out
of
it
she
was
in
trouble
often
enough
in
the
nursery
nurse
always
took
barbara
part
against
her
and
accused
her
of
being
violent
and
and
then
lady
isabel
the
children
mother
would
send
for
her
to
her
room
while
she
dressed
for
dinner
and
say
complainingly
alex
why
do
you
quarrel
so
with
the
others
i
shall
send
you
to
school
if
you
ca
be
happy
with
barbara
at
home
oh
do
send
me
to
school
mummy
not
if
you
good
i
will
be
good
really
i
will
very
well
my
child
now
ring
for
hawkins
or
i
shall
be
late
may
i
stay
and
watch
you
put
on
your
diamond
things
mummy
do
let
me
and
lady
isabel
always
laughed
and
let
her
stay
so
that
alex
eventually
went
back
to
the
nursery
with
an
elated
sense
of
having
been
very
good
and
accorded
privileges
which
never
fell
to
the
lot
of
barbara
she
knew
she
was
her
mother
favourite
because
she
was
the
eldest
and
was
often
sent
for
to
the
when
there
were
people
there
barbara
of
course
was
too
ugly
to
go
much
to
the
alex
would
toss
her
own
mane
of
silky
brown
curls
and
draw
herself
up
conceitedly
as
she
thought
of
barbara
pale
face
and
thin
attenuated
ringlets
besides
lady
isabel
had
said
that
barbara
really
must
come
down
again
when
people
were
there
until
her
second
teeth
had
put
in
their
tardy
appearance
even
cedric
though
acclaimed
as
quaint
and
solemn
by
his
mother
friends
was
too
apt
to
make
disconcerting
comments
on
their
sparkling
conversation
and
would
return
to
the
nursery
in
disgrace
alex
only
rival
for
downstairs
favour
was
little
archie
who
was
only
four
and
at
present
a
very
pretty
little
boy
but
he
was
too
small
for
alex
ever
to
feel
jealous
of
him
the
new
baby
christened
with
pomp
in
the
big
catholic
church
at
the
end
of
the
square
pamela
isabel
was
so
far
a
neglible
quantity
in
the
nursery
world
she
slept
in
the
little
room
called
the
inner
nursery
most
of
the
day
and
was
only
with
the
others
when
they
were
taken
into
the
park
or
to
play
in
the
square
garden
then
emily
pushed
the
big
pram
that
contained
the
slumbering
pamela
and
nurse
grasped
the
hands
of
barbara
and
archie
and
dragged
them
over
the
crossings
cedric
by
nurse
express
orders
always
walked
just
in
front
of
her
with
alex
and
unwillingly
submitted
to
having
his
hand
held
by
his
sister
not
that
i
trust
alex
for
common
sense
nurse
was
careful
to
explain
not
a
yard
but
so
long
as
they
together
i
can
keep
an
eye
on
both
and
see
they
do
get
under
no
hansom
feet
that
boy
spectacles
are
too
downright
uncanny
for
me
to
let
him
cross
the
road
alone
for
cedric
was
obliged
to
wear
a
large
pair
of
round
spectacles
without
which
he
could
only
see
things
that
were
very
close
to
his
eyes
he
even
had
another
different
pair
for
reading
which
seemed
to
alex
an
exaggerated
precaution
likely
to
increase
cedric
sense
of
his
own
importance
well
said
cedric
you
have
a
plate
and
i
have
alex
plate
was
an
instrument
of
torture
designed
to
push
back
two
prominent
front
teeth
it
not
only
hurt
her
and
kept
her
awake
at
night
but
was
very
disfiguring
besides
and
she
passionately
envied
barbara
who
at
nine
years
old
still
had
only
gaps
where
her
front
teeth
should
have
been
of
course
alex
would
sometimes
declare
grandly
repeating
what
she
had
heard
lady
isabel
say
barbara
is
dreadfully
backward
she
such
a
baby
for
her
age
very
old
for
my
age
but
she
only
said
this
in
the
where
it
would
provoke
kindly
laughter
or
perhaps
interested
comment
in
the
nursery
nurse
never
suffered
any
airs
and
graces
as
she
called
them
and
would
pounce
on
alex
and
shake
her
at
the
least
hint
of
any
such
nonsense
just
you
wait
till
you
sent
to
a
good
strict
school
my
lady
and
see
what
you
get
then
she
told
her
threateningly
i
not
going
to
school
mummy
said
i
should
go
if
i
was
good
we
shall
see
what
we
shall
see
children
as
think
themselves
everybody
at
home
gets
whipped
when
they
go
to
school
nurse
told
her
severely
alex
was
used
to
these
prognostications
they
did
not
alarm
her
very
much
because
she
did
not
think
that
she
would
be
sent
to
school
she
knew
instinctively
that
her
father
disapproved
of
ordinary
schools
and
that
her
mother
disliked
convents
and
indeed
most
things
that
had
to
do
with
religion
alex
supposed
that
this
was
because
lady
isabel
was
a
protestant
she
thought
that
it
was
much
the
nicest
religion
to
belong
to
on
the
whole
since
it
evidently
imposed
no
obligations
in
the
nature
of
and
she
often
wondered
why
her
mother
had
let
all
her
children
be
catholics
instead
of
protestants
like
herself
it
certainly
could
be
because
father
cared
which
church
the
children
went
to
or
whether
they
went
at
all
the
only
person
in
the
house
who
did
seem
to
care
was
nurse
who
took
alex
and
barbara
and
cedric
to
high
mass
at
the
oratory
every
sunday
where
there
was
a
front
bench
reserved
for
them
with
little
cards
in
brass
frames
planted
at
intervals
along
the
ledge
in
front
of
them
bearing
the
name
of
sir
francis
clare
nurse
put
barbara
on
one
side
of
her
and
alex
on
the
other
and
cedric
on
the
outside
and
was
very
particular
about
their
kneeling
down
and
standing
up
at
the
right
moment
and
keeping
the
open
in
front
of
them
alex
and
barbara
each
had
a
of
the
but
cedric
was
only
allowed
which
had
pictures
and
anecdotes
illustrative
of
vice
and
virtue
at
the
end
alex
knew
all
the
anecdotes
by
heart
and
preferred
her
own
book
with
its
small
close
print
she
had
long
since
discovered
that
the
one
matter
over
which
nurse
could
be
hoodwinked
was
print
and
that
she
might
quite
safely
indulge
herself
in
the
perusal
of
the
pages
devoted
to
the
sacrament
of
holy
matrimony
or
to
a
mysterious
ceremony
called
churching
after
during
the
many
dull
portions
of
the
long
service
the
only
part
of
church
that
held
possibilities
was
when
the
little
bell
rang
at
the
elevation
and
every
one
bent
his
or
her
head
as
far
down
as
it
would
go
over
the
bench
alex
always
looked
up
surreptitiously
then
to
see
if
by
any
chance
a
miracle
was
taking
place
or
to
watch
invariable
manoeuvre
of
hanging
on
to
the
ledge
by
his
teeth
and
hands
and
trying
to
raise
his
feet
from
the
floor
at
the
same
time
nurse
was
always
piously
bent
double
her
face
hidden
in
her
cotton
gloves
breathing
stertorously
with
barbara
on
the
other
side
devotedly
imitating
her
even
to
the
production
of
strange
sounds
through
her
own
lips
after
that
alex
always
knew
that
the
end
of
church
was
near
and
that
as
soon
as
the
priest
had
taken
up
his
little
square
headgear
and
faced
the
congregation
for
the
last
time
nurse
would
begin
to
poke
her
violently
as
a
sign
that
she
was
to
get
up
and
to
make
cedric
pick
up
his
cap
and
his
gloves
then
came
the
genuflection
as
they
filed
out
between
the
benches
and
nurse
was
always
very
particular
that
this
should
be
done
properly
frequently
pressing
a
heavy
hand
on
alex
shoulder
until
her
knee
bumped
painfully
against
the
stone
floor
the
final
ceremony
connected
with
the
children
religion
took
place
at
the
door
when
cedric
had
to
make
his
way
through
rustling
skirts
and
an
occasional
pair
of
black
trousers
to
the
big
stone
basin
of
holy
water
into
this
standing
on
tiptoe
with
immense
difficulty
he
plunged
as
much
of
his
hand
as
was
necessary
to
satisfy
the
sharp
inspection
of
nurse
when
he
returned
proffering
dripping
fingers
to
her
and
to
his
sisters
the
last
perfunctory
sign
of
the
cross
made
then
the
worst
of
sunday
in
alex
opinion
was
over
roast
beef
and
yorkshire
pudding
for
dinner
was
pleasant
mademoiselle
did
not
come
in
the
afternoon
and
nurse
generally
went
out
and
left
emily
in
charge
in
the
summer
she
took
the
children
to
sit
in
the
square
garden
the
park
on
sundays
was
not
allowed
and
in
the
winter
they
always
walked
as
far
as
the
albert
memorial
for
which
cedric
entertained
a
great
admiration
sunday
was
lady
isabel
at
home
day
and
the
children
except
during
the
season
always
went
down
to
the
after
tea
alex
and
barbara
in
pale
frocks
with
innumerable
frills
at
throat
and
wrists
and
a
small
pad
fastened
under
each
skirt
so
that
it
might
stand
well
out
at
the
back
cedric
like
most
other
little
boys
of
his
age
and
standing
was
forced
to
wear
a
lord
fauntleroy
suit
from
which
his
cropped
bullet
head
and
spectacles
emerged
incongruously
the
in
the
was
not
enjoyed
by
the
others
as
it
was
by
alex
especially
if
there
were
many
visitors
she
would
lean
against
lady
isabel
confidently
and
hear
people
say
how
like
she
was
to
her
mother
which
always
delighted
her
her
mother
looked
so
pretty
sitting
on
the
sofa
with
her
fringe
beautifully
curled
and
a
lovely
dress
that
was
half
a
teagown
the
tight
bodice
coming
down
into
a
sharp
point
in
front
and
behind
and
the
skirt
falling
into
long
folds
with
a
train
sweeping
the
ground
and
huge
loops
and
bows
of
soft
ribbon
draping
it
barbara
was
incurably
shy
and
poked
her
head
when
she
was
spoken
to
but
very
few
people
took
as
much
notice
of
her
as
of
talkative
alex
or
pretty
little
archie
who
was
all
blue
ribbons
and
fearless
smiles
and
before
very
long
lady
isabel
was
sure
to
say
now
you
better
run
back
to
the
nursery
had
you
darlings
or
nurse
will
be
comin
down
in
search
of
you
i
got
the
most
invaluable
old
dragon
for
them
she
generally
added
to
her
friends
she
been
with
us
since
alex
was
a
baby
and
rules
the
whole
house
oh
do
send
them
away
one
of
the
visiting
ladies
would
exclaim
politely
darlings
oh
but
i
must
their
father
wo
of
my
spoilin
them
now
run
along
infants
cedric
and
barbara
were
only
too
ready
to
obey
though
it
was
understood
that
lady
isabel
run
along
only
meant
a
very
ceremonious
departure
from
the
room
barbara
taking
little
archie
by
the
hand
and
leading
him
to
the
door
where
they
both
dropped
the
obeisance
considered
picturesque
and
cedric
making
an
unwilling
progress
to
execute
his
carefully
practised
bow
before
each
one
of
the
ladies
scattered
about
the
big
room
if
alex
however
was
enjoying
herself
and
getting
the
notice
that
her
soul
loved
she
always
said
in
a
pleading
whisper
loud
enough
to
be
heard
by
two
or
three
people
besides
her
mother
oh
do
let
me
stay
with
you
a
little
longer
mummy
do
send
me
upstairs
yet
how
sweet
do
let
her
stay
dear
lady
isabel
you
must
encourage
me
to
spoil
her
she
ought
to
go
up
with
the
others
just
for
this
once
mummy
well
just
for
this
once
perhaps
after
all
said
lady
isabel
apologetically
she
the
eldest
she
be
comin
out
before
i
know
where
i
am
and
alex
would
enjoy
the
privilege
of
being
the
eldest
and
sit
beside
her
mother
listening
to
the
conversation
and
sometimes
joining
in
with
remarks
that
she
thought
might
be
acclaimed
as
amusing
or
original
or
even
merely
precocious
no
wonder
that
the
nursery
greeted
her
return
with
disdain
even
emily
called
her
child
and
by
her
contempt
brought
alex
ready
tears
of
mortified
vanity
to
the
surface
but
it
was
much
worse
on
the
rare
sunday
afternoons
when
nurse
was
in
when
she
would
greatly
resent
the
slight
to
barbara
if
she
was
sent
up
from
the
before
her
sister
working
on
your
mamma
to
spoil
you
like
that
just
because
you
a
couple
of
years
older
nurse
would
say
pulling
the
comb
fiercely
through
alex
hair
as
she
went
to
bed
i
three
whole
years
older
do
you
contradict
me
like
that
alex
i
not
going
to
have
any
up
here
i
can
tell
you
you
can
keep
those
airs
and
graces
for
your
mamma
friends
in
the
alex
generally
went
to
bed
in
tears
if
nurse
had
not
been
scolding
her
then
barbara
had
been
quarrelling
with
her
they
always
quarrelled
whenever
barbara
ventured
to
differ
from
alex
and
take
up
an
attitude
of
her
own
or
still
more
when
barbara
and
cedric
made
an
alliance
together
and
excluded
alex
autocratic
ruling
of
their
games
but
it
is
for
your
good
she
would
tell
them
passionately
i
want
to
show
you
a
better
way
it
be
much
more
fun
if
you
do
it
my
way
you
see
but
they
did
not
want
to
see
their
obstinacy
always
brought
to
alex
the
same
sense
of
incredulous
resentful
fury
how
they
not
want
to
be
shown
the
best
way
of
doing
things
when
she
knew
it
and
they
did
and
of
course
she
always
did
know
it
was
she
not
the
eldest
it
was
not
till
alex
was
almost
thirteen
that
her
belief
in
her
own
infallibility
as
eldest
received
a
rude
shock
she
nearly
killed
barbara
it
was
the
first
week
of
august
and
sir
francis
and
lady
isabel
had
gone
to
scotland
the
children
were
going
to
the
sea
with
nurse
on
the
following
day
and
took
advantage
of
her
state
of
excitement
over
the
packing
and
the
emptiness
of
the
downstair
rooms
to
play
at
circus
on
the
stairs
emily
only
said
now
do
go
hurting
yourselves
whatever
you
do
or
there
be
no
seaside
tomorrow
and
then
went
back
to
amuse
pamela
who
was
crying
and
restless
from
the
heat
i
tell
you
what
said
alex
we
have
dancing
tired
of
learned
pigs
and
things
like
that
this
last
impersonation
having
been
perseveringly
rendered
by
cedric
with
much
shuffling
and
snorting
over
a
pack
of
cards
give
me
the
barbara
why
said
barbara
whining
because
i
say
so
replied
her
sister
stamping
her
foot
i
got
an
idea
it
my
but
if
you
do
give
it
to
me
we
ca
have
the
dancing
said
alex
in
despair
i
do
care
why
should
you
do
dancing
with
my
you
shall
do
it
first
you
shall
do
it
all
yourself
if
you
only
let
me
show
you
alex
cried
in
an
agony
of
impatience
on
this
inducement
barbara
slowly
parted
with
her
and
let
alex
knot
it
hastily
and
insecurely
to
the
newel
post
on
the
first
landing
above
the
hall
now
just
get
up
on
to
the
post
barbara
and
i
hold
the
other
end
of
the
rope
like
this
and
you
see
but
i
ca
i
should
fall
off
do
be
such
a
little
muff
i
hold
you
on
no
no
i
frightened
let
cedric
do
it
no
said
cedric
i
being
a
learned
pig
he
went
down
the
short
flight
of
stairs
and
sat
firmly
down
upon
the
tiled
floor
with
the
pack
of
cards
before
him
now
come
on
barbara
alex
commanded
her
i
hold
you
between
hoisting
and
pulling
and
barbara
own
dread
of
disobeying
her
alex
got
her
sister
into
a
kneeling
position
on
the
broad
flat
top
of
the
newel
post
now
stand
up
and
then
i
hold
out
the
rope
you
be
the
famous
dancer
crossing
the
falls
of
niagara
alex
i
frightened
what
of
silly
if
you
did
fall
it
only
a
little
way
on
to
the
stairs
and
i
catch
you
besides
you
feel
much
safer
when
standing
up
barbara
facing
the
stairs
and
with
her
back
to
the
alarming
void
between
her
perch
and
the
rose
trembling
to
her
feet
you
look
splendid
said
alex
now
then
she
jerked
at
the
rope
and
at
the
same
instant
barbara
screamed
and
tried
to
clutch
at
her
alex
caught
hold
of
her
sister
ankles
felt
barbara
weight
slip
suddenly
and
screamed
aloud
as
a
shriek
and
crash
that
seemed
simultaneous
proclaimed
barbara
fall
backwards
into
the
hall
cedric
and
barbara
in
a
confused
struggling
heap
on
the
floor
doors
opening
upstairs
and
in
the
basement
the
flying
feet
of
the
servants
all
was
an
agonized
nightmare
to
alex
until
barbara
limp
and
inert
on
nurse
lap
suddenly
began
to
scream
and
cry
calling
out
my
back
my
back
they
hushed
her
at
last
and
nurse
carried
her
into
the
boudoir
which
was
the
nearest
room
and
laid
her
down
on
the
broad
sofa
then
alex
became
aware
of
a
monotonous
sound
that
had
struck
on
her
ear
without
penetrating
to
her
senses
ever
since
the
accident
happened
my
spectacles
are
broken
you
broken
my
spectacles
reiterated
a
lamentable
voice
you
horrid
heartless
little
boy
cedric
when
poor
barbara
sobs
choked
her
i
like
that
said
cedric
when
it
was
all
you
that
made
her
fall
at
all
and
break
my
spectacles
what
that
said
nurse
miraculously
reappearing
all
you
was
it
i
might
have
known
it
you
mischievous
wicked
child
tell
me
what
happened
this
minute
but
alex
was
screaming
and
writhing
on
the
floor
feeling
as
though
she
must
die
of
such
misery
and
it
was
cedric
who
gave
the
assembled
household
a
judicial
version
of
the
accident
the
doctor
came
and
telegrams
were
sent
to
scotland
which
brought
back
lady
isabel
and
tearful
and
sir
francis
very
stern
and
monosyllabic
father
my
spectacles
are
broken
cried
cedric
earnestly
running
to
meet
them
but
they
did
not
seem
to
hear
him
where
is
she
nurse
said
lady
isabel
in
the
boudoir
my
lady
and
better
thank
heaven
the
doctor
says
her
back
get
right
again
in
time
alex
hanging
shaking
over
the
balustrade
saw
that
nurse
was
making
faces
as
though
she
were
crying
but
when
she
came
upstairs
after
a
long
time
spent
with
lady
isabel
in
the
boudoir
and
saw
alex
her
face
was
quite
hard
again
and
she
gave
her
a
push
and
said
it
no
use
crying
those
crocodile
tears
now
you
should
have
thought
of
that
before
trying
to
kill
barbara
the
way
you
did
i
did
i
did
sobbed
alex
but
nobody
paid
any
attention
to
her
emily
was
sent
away
because
nurse
said
she
was
fit
to
be
trusted
and
cook
who
was
emily
aunt
and
very
angry
about
it
all
told
alex
that
it
was
all
her
fault
if
poor
emily
never
got
another
place
at
all
everything
was
alex
fault
there
was
no
going
to
the
seaside
even
after
barbara
was
pronounced
better
but
lady
isabel
who
nurse
said
had
been
given
a
dreadful
shock
by
alex
wickedness
was
going
into
the
country
and
would
take
archie
and
the
baby
with
her
if
they
could
get
a
new
at
once
and
me
and
cedric
asked
alex
trembling
cedric
does
give
me
no
trouble
as
you
very
well
know
and
stay
here
and
help
me
amuse
poor
little
barbara
as
has
always
got
on
with
him
so
nicely
shall
i
stay
and
play
with
barbara
too
she
a
long
way
from
playing
yet
nurse
returned
grimly
and
i
should
think
the
sight
of
you
would
throw
her
into
a
fit
after
passed
but
what
will
happen
to
me
nurse
sobbed
alex
your
papa
will
talk
to
you
said
nurse
such
a
thing
had
never
happened
to
any
of
the
children
before
but
alex
trembling
and
sick
from
crying
found
herself
confronting
sir
francis
in
the
i
am
going
to
send
you
to
school
alex
he
told
her
how
old
are
you
twelve
then
i
hope
said
sir
francis
gravely
that
you
are
old
enough
to
understand
what
a
terrible
thing
it
is
to
be
sent
from
home
in
disgrace
for
such
a
reason
i
am
told
that
you
have
the
deplorable
reputation
of
originating
quarrels
with
your
brothers
and
sister
who
but
for
you
would
lead
the
normal
existence
of
children
alex
was
terrified
she
could
not
answer
these
terrible
imputations
and
began
to
cry
convulsively
i
see
said
sir
francis
that
you
are
sensible
of
the
appalling
lengths
to
which
this
tendency
has
led
you
even
now
i
can
scarcely
believe
it
a
harmless
gentle
child
like
your
little
sister
who
i
am
assured
has
never
done
you
wilful
injury
in
her
life
that
you
should
deliberately
endanger
her
life
and
her
reason
in
such
a
fashion
he
paused
as
though
he
were
waiting
for
alex
to
speak
but
she
could
not
say
anything
if
your
repentance
is
sincere
as
i
willingly
assume
it
to
be
your
future
behaviour
must
be
such
as
to
lead
us
all
particularly
your
poor
little
sister
to
forget
this
terrible
beginning
will
barbara
get
well
by
the
great
mercy
of
heaven
and
owing
to
her
extreme
youth
we
are
assured
by
the
doctor
that
a
year
or
two
will
entirely
correct
the
injury
to
the
spine
had
it
been
otherwise
alex
sir
francis
looked
at
his
daughter
in
silence
when
thanking
heaven
for
the
mercy
which
has
preserved
your
life
he
said
gently
i
hope
you
will
reflect
seriously
upon
redeeming
this
action
by
your
future
conduct
oh
i
sorry
oh
shall
you
ever
forgive
me
gasped
alex
amongst
her
sobs
i
do
forgive
you
my
child
as
does
your
mother
and
as
i
am
convinced
that
little
barbara
will
do
but
i
can
not
nor
would
i
if
i
could
avert
from
you
the
consequence
of
your
own
act
said
her
father
barbara
did
forgive
alex
in
a
little
plaintive
superior
voice
as
she
lay
very
white
and
straight
in
bed
she
was
to
stay
quite
flat
on
her
back
for
at
least
a
year
the
doctor
said
and
she
need
do
no
lessons
and
later
she
would
be
taken
out
in
a
long
flat
carriage
that
could
be
pushed
from
behind
then
she
would
be
able
to
walk
again
and
her
back
would
be
quite
straight
if
she
been
a
hunchback
we
might
have
played
circus
again
and
i
could
have
been
the
learned
pig
said
cedric
reflectively
alex
went
to
school
at
the
end
of
september
and
that
was
her
first
practical
experience
of
the
game
of
consequences
as
played
by
the
freakish
hand
of
fate
ii
school
alex
schooldays
were
marked
by
a
series
of
emotional
episodes
in
her
scale
of
values
only
the
personal
element
counted
for
anything
she
was
intelligent
and
industrious
at
her
classes
when
she
wished
to
gain
the
approbation
of
an
attractive
and
idle
and
inattentive
when
she
wanted
to
please
the
pretty
girl
with
yellow
hair
who
sat
next
her
and
read
a
under
cover
of
a
french
grammar
alex
did
not
read
she
wanted
to
make
the
girl
look
at
her
and
smile
at
her
she
thought
queenie
torrance
beautiful
though
her
beauty
did
not
strike
alex
until
after
she
had
fallen
a
helpless
victim
to
one
of
those
violent
irrational
attractions
for
one
of
her
own
sex
that
are
apt
to
assail
feminine
adolescence
i
hope
that
you
will
find
some
nice
little
companions
at
liège
sir
francis
had
gravely
told
his
daughter
in
valediction
but
remember
that
exclusive
friendships
are
not
to
be
desired
friendly
with
all
familiar
with
none
said
sir
francis
voicing
the
ideal
of
his
class
and
of
his
period
as
well
tell
a
stream
not
to
flow
downhill
nothing
but
the
most
exclusive
and
inordinate
of
attachments
lay
within
the
scope
of
emotional
capacities
she
was
incapable
alike
of
asking
or
of
bestowing
in
moderation
theoretically
she
would
tell
herself
that
she
would
give
all
trust
confidence
love
friendship
and
ask
for
nothing
in
return
practically
she
suffered
tortures
of
jealousy
if
the
loved
one
addressed
a
word
or
smile
to
any
but
herself
and
cried
herself
to
sleep
night
after
night
in
the
certainty
of
loving
infinitely
more
than
she
was
loved
the
material
side
of
her
life
as
a
at
the
liège
convent
made
very
little
impression
upon
her
excepting
in
relation
to
the
emotional
aspect
of
which
she
was
never
unaware
to
the
end
of
her
days
the
clean
pungent
smell
of
a
certain
polish
used
upon
the
immense
spaces
of
bare
all
over
the
building
would
serve
to
recall
the
vivid
presentment
of
the
tall
belgian
whose
duty
it
was
to
apply
it
with
a
huge
mop
and
whom
from
a
distance
only
to
be
appreciated
by
those
who
know
the
immensity
of
the
gulf
that
in
the
convent
world
separates
the
novice
from
the
pupils
alex
had
worshipped
blindly
and
the
acrid
yet
not
unpleasant
taste
of
thinly
spread
over
thick
slices
of
brown
bread
would
remind
her
with
equal
vividness
of
the
daily
three
interval
for
with
queenie
torrance
pacing
beside
her
in
the
garden
quadrangle
one
hand
of
each
rolled
into
her
apron
to
try
and
keep
warm
and
the
other
grasping
the
enormous
double
that
formed
the
afternoon
refection
even
the
slight
steady
sound
of
hissing
escaping
from
a
gas
jet
of
which
the
flame
is
turned
as
high
as
it
will
go
stood
to
alex
for
the
noisy
evening
recreation
spent
in
the
enforced
and
detested
amusement
of
when
her
only
preoccupation
was
to
place
herself
by
the
object
of
her
adoration
for
the
grasp
of
her
hand
in
its
regulation
cotton
glove
as
the
circle
of
girls
moved
drearily
round
and
round
singing
perfunctorily
the
tuneless
tune
of
those
remained
with
alex
long
after
the
words
had
lost
the
savour
of
irony
with
which
novelty
had
once
invested
them
quelle
horrible
postulante
une
quel
comble
soeur
de
choeur
alex
symbols
were
not
romantic
ones
but
there
was
no
romance
in
the
life
of
the
liège
convent
save
what
she
brought
to
it
herself
even
the
memory
of
the
great
square
in
the
middle
of
gravelled
alleys
brought
to
her
mind
for
sole
token
of
summer
only
her
horror
of
the
immense
slugs
that
crawled
slowly
and
interminably
out
and
across
the
paths
in
the
eternal
rains
of
the
belgian
climate
nothing
mattered
but
people
and
of
all
the
people
in
the
world
only
those
whom
one
loved
thus
alex
sweeping
unformulated
conviction
holding
in
it
all
the
misapplication
of
an
essential
force
squandered
for
lack
of
a
sense
of
proportion
she
despised
herself
secretly
both
for
her
intense
craving
for
affection
and
for
her
prodigality
in
bestowing
it
she
was
like
a
child
endeavouring
to
pour
a
great
pailful
of
water
into
a
very
little
cup
waste
and
disaster
were
the
inevitable
results
the
real
love
of
alex
young
enthusiasm
queenie
torrance
was
preceded
by
her
inarticulate
unreasoned
adoration
for
the
belgian
but
the
belgian
was
never
visible
save
at
a
distance
so
that
even
alex
unreasonable
affections
found
nothing
to
feed
upon
there
was
a
french
girl
much
older
than
herself
for
whom
alex
then
conceived
an
enthusiasm
smiled
on
her
and
encouraged
the
infatuation
of
the
curiously
little
english
girl
but
she
gave
her
nothing
in
return
alex
knew
it
and
recklessly
spent
all
her
weekly
on
flowers
and
sweets
for
thinking
that
the
gifts
would
touch
her
and
awaken
in
her
an
affection
that
it
was
not
her
nature
to
bestow
least
of
all
on
an
ardent
and
ungainly
child
six
years
her
junior
alex
shed
many
tears
for
and
years
later
read
some
words
that
suddenly
and
swiftly
recalled
the
girl
who
passed
in
and
out
of
her
life
in
less
than
a
year
i
love
you
for
your
few
caresses
love
you
for
my
many
tears
the
lines
indeed
were
curiously
typical
of
the
relations
into
which
alex
entered
so
rashly
and
so
inevitably
throughout
her
schooldays
she
was
fifteen
and
had
been
nearly
three
years
at
liège
when
queenie
torrance
came
she
was
alex
senior
by
a
year
and
the
only
other
english
girl
in
the
school
at
that
time
alex
was
told
to
look
after
her
and
went
to
the
task
with
a
certain
naïve
eagerness
that
she
always
brought
to
bear
upon
any
personal
equation
in
an
hour
she
was
secretly
combating
an
enraptured
certainty
of
which
she
felt
nevertheless
ashamed
that
she
had
found
at
last
the
ideal
object
on
whom
to
expend
the
vehement
powers
of
affection
for
which
she
was
always
seeking
an
outlet
queenie
was
slight
very
fair
with
a
full
serious
oval
face
innocent
grey
eyes
set
very
far
apart
and
the
high
rounded
forehead
and
small
mouth
of
a
type
much
in
vogue
in
england
at
the
time
of
the
regency
this
was
the
more
marked
by
the
thick
flaxen
hair
which
fell
back
from
her
face
and
over
her
shoulders
into
natural
heavy
ringlets
she
was
not
very
pretty
although
she
was
often
thought
so
but
she
was
charged
with
a
certain
animal
magnetism
almost
inseparable
from
her
type
half
the
girls
in
the
school
adored
her
queenie
already
attractive
to
men
and
sent
to
the
convent
in
belgium
in
reality
on
that
account
nominally
for
a
year
finishing
before
her
début
in
london
society
was
for
the
most
part
scornful
of
these
girlish
admirers
but
alex
she
admitted
to
her
friendship
she
was
precociously
aware
that
intimacy
with
lady
isabel
daughter
was
likely
to
accrue
to
her
own
advantage
later
on
in
london
the
genius
for
sympathy
which
led
alex
to
innumerable
small
sacrifices
and
tender
smoothings
of
difficulties
for
her
idol
queenie
at
first
received
with
a
graceful
gratitude
which
yet
held
in
it
something
of
suspicion
as
though
she
wondered
what
return
would
presently
be
exacted
of
her
but
it
became
obvious
that
alex
expected
nothing
and
received
with
eager
thankfulness
the
slightest
recognition
of
her
devotion
queenie
despised
her
but
was
lavish
of
gentle
thanks
and
caressing
exclamations
hers
was
not
a
nature
ever
to
make
the
mistake
of
killing
the
goose
that
laid
the
golden
eggs
finding
to
her
concealed
astonishment
that
alex
only
asked
toleration
or
at
the
most
acceptance
of
her
ardent
devotion
and
was
transported
at
the
slightest
occasional
token
of
affection
in
return
queenie
stinted
her
of
neither
it
would
have
seemed
to
her
the
most
irrational
folly
to
discourage
a
love
however
that
found
its
expression
in
tireless
sympathy
endless
championship
and
unlimited
material
gifts
and
help
of
any
or
every
description
alex
did
all
that
she
could
of
queenie
lessons
made
her
bed
and
mended
her
clothes
for
her
whenever
she
could
do
so
undetected
by
the
authorities
spent
her
on
gratifying
queenie
shameless
and
inordinate
passion
for
sweet
things
and
once
or
twice
told
lies
badly
and
unsuccessfully
to
shield
queenie
from
the
effects
of
her
own
laziness
and
constant
evasion
of
regulations
alex
had
been
taught
in
common
with
every
other
child
of
her
upbringing
and
nationality
that
to
tell
a
lie
was
the
worst
crime
to
which
a
human
being
can
stoop
she
also
believed
that
a
person
who
has
told
a
lie
is
a
liar
and
that
all
liars
go
to
hell
yet
by
some
utterly
illogical
perversity
of
which
she
was
hardly
even
aware
it
did
not
shock
or
very
much
distress
her
to
find
that
queenie
torrance
told
lies
and
told
them
moreover
with
an
air
of
quiet
and
convincing
candour
that
placed
them
in
a
very
different
category
to
alex
own
halting
improbable
fibs
delivered
with
a
scarlet
face
and
a
manifest
air
of
hunting
for
further
corroboration
as
she
spoke
in
the
extraordinary
scale
of
moral
values
unconsciously
held
by
alex
there
were
apparently
no
abstract
standards
of
right
and
wrong
where
she
loved
though
she
might
against
her
own
will
see
defects
she
was
incapable
of
condemning
queenie
took
a
curious
detached
interest
in
coldly
gratifying
her
vanity
by
seeking
to
test
the
lengths
of
extravagance
to
which
admiration
would
go
supposing
i
quarrelled
with
every
one
here
and
they
all
sent
me
to
coventry
whose
part
would
you
take
yours
of
course
but
if
i
were
in
the
wrong
that
would
make
any
difference
in
fact
you
need
it
more
if
you
were
in
the
wrong
i
do
see
that
queenie
exclaimed
if
i
were
in
the
wrong
i
should
have
deserved
it
but
that
would
make
it
all
the
worse
for
you
it
always
the
people
who
are
in
the
wrong
who
need
most
to
have
their
part
taken
alex
explained
confusedly
yet
voicing
an
intimate
conviction
i
do
think
you
have
much
idea
of
justice
alex
said
queenie
drily
the
conversation
made
alex
very
miserable
it
was
characteristic
of
her
want
of
logic
that
while
she
reproached
herself
secretly
for
her
own
impiety
in
setting
the
objects
of
her
affection
far
above
what
she
conceived
to
be
the
abstract
standard
of
right
and
wrong
yet
she
never
questioned
but
that
any
love
bestowed
upon
herself
would
be
measured
out
in
direct
proportion
to
her
merits
and
despairingly
did
alex
sometimes
review
the
smallness
of
her
deserts
she
was
disobedient
untruthful
quarrelsome
irreligious
it
seemed
to
alex
that
there
was
no
fault
to
which
she
could
not
lay
claim
her
lack
of
elementary
religious
teaching
put
her
at
a
disadvantage
in
the
convent
atmosphere
and
made
its
frequent
religious
services
and
instructions
so
tedious
to
her
that
she
was
in
constant
disgrace
for
her
weary
inattentive
attitudes
not
unjustly
designated
as
irreverent
in
the
chapel
she
was
not
at
all
popular
with
the
nuns
the
influence
which
her
wielded
over
so
many
of
the
pupils
or
the
interest
which
the
english
assistant
superior
would
so
willingly
have
extended
to
her
youthful
compatriot
were
alike
without
effect
upon
alex
she
was
not
drawn
to
any
of
these
holy
women
to
one
or
other
of
whom
almost
all
her
french
and
belgian
and
american
contemporaries
devoted
a
rather
stereotyped
enthusiasm
had
the
vagrant
fancy
of
alex
lighted
upon
any
one
of
the
elder
nuns
charged
with
the
direction
of
the
school
the
attraction
would
have
been
discreetly
permitted
if
not
admittedly
sanctioned
by
the
authorities
it
would
almost
inevitably
have
led
alex
to
an
awakening
of
religious
sensibilities
and
the
desirability
of
this
result
would
have
outweighed
even
if
it
did
not
absolutely
obscure
in
the
eyes
of
the
nuns
the
excessive
danger
of
obtaining
such
a
result
by
such
means
but
the
stars
in
their
courses
had
designed
that
alex
should
regard
the
mesdames
marie
baptiste
and
marie
evangeliste
of
her
convent
days
with
indifference
and
devote
her
ardent
temperament
and
precocious
sensibilities
to
the
worship
of
queenie
torrance
the
enthusiasm
was
smiled
upon
by
no
one
and
thereby
became
the
more
inflamed
je
pas
ces
amitiés
particulières
said
the
of
queenie
torrance
severely
to
which
miss
torrance
replied
with
polite
distress
that
she
was
powerless
in
the
matter
it
made
her
ridiculous
she
disliked
the
constant
infringement
of
rules
to
which
alex
pursuit
exposed
her
but
one
could
not
be
unkind
she
did
not
know
why
alex
clare
showed
her
especial
affection
she
herself
had
done
nothing
to
encourage
these
indiscreet
displays
of
course
it
was
pleasant
to
be
liked
but
one
wished
only
to
do
right
about
it
queenie
mingled
candour
with
perplexity
and
succeeded
in
convincing
every
one
with
perfect
completeness
of
her
entire
innocence
of
anything
but
a
too
potent
attraction
ce
donc
même
pas
une
amitié
alex
qui
vous
recherche
malgré
vous
exclaimed
the
under
this
aspect
the
question
soon
presented
itself
alike
to
the
and
its
authorities
rendering
alex
ridiculous
in
a
system
of
which
admitted
of
no
loophole
for
open
defiance
or
outspoken
rebuke
alex
evasions
of
that
law
of
detachment
which
is
the
primary
one
in
convent
legislation
became
the
mark
of
every
de
who
wished
to
obtain
a
reputation
for
zeal
by
reporting
the
defection
of
a
companion
to
her
it
was
always
alex
who
was
reported
queenie
never
sought
opportunities
to
snatch
a
hurried
colloquy
during
recreation
or
manoeuvred
to
obtain
alex
as
companion
at
or
when
they
played
games
in
the
garden
she
never
infringed
one
of
the
strictest
rules
of
the
establishment
by
giving
presents
unpermitted
or
purchasing
forbidden
sweets
and
chocolate
to
be
given
away
at
the
afternoon
queenie
accepted
the
presents
wrote
tiny
notes
to
alex
and
skilfully
gave
them
to
her
unperceived
and
cut
alex
to
the
heart
by
telling
her
sometimes
that
she
made
it
very
hard
for
one
to
try
and
be
good
and
keep
all
the
rules
and
perhaps
get
one
blue
ribbon
next
term
these
speeches
were
to
queenie
credit
and
made
alex
cry
and
worship
her
more
admiringly
than
ever
but
they
did
not
tend
to
lower
the
transparent
doglike
devotion
with
which
alex
would
gaze
at
bent
profile
in
the
chapel
utterly
unconscious
of
the
scandal
which
her
manifest
idolatry
was
creating
for
the
severe
nun
in
the
carved
stall
opposite
she
was
scolded
placed
under
strict
observation
and
every
obstacle
placed
in
the
way
of
her
exchanging
any
word
with
queenie
until
she
grew
to
see
herself
as
a
martyr
to
an
affection
which
every
fresh
prohibition
increased
almost
to
frenzy
one
day
she
was
made
the
victim
of
a
form
of
rebuke
much
dreaded
by
the
a
monthly
convocation
of
the
school
and
mistresses
officially
known
as
réclame
du
and
nicknamed
by
the
children
the
last
judgment
was
held
in
the
downstairs
with
the
superior
making
her
state
entry
after
the
children
had
been
decorously
seated
in
rows
at
the
end
of
the
long
room
and
all
the
other
nuns
who
had
anything
to
do
with
the
school
had
placed
themselves
gravely
and
with
folded
hands
against
the
walls
they
all
stood
when
the
superior
came
in
followed
by
the
first
mistress
carrying
a
sheaf
of
notes
and
a
great
book
which
each
pupil
firmly
believed
to
be
devoted
principally
to
the
record
of
her
own
progress
through
the
school
then
the
superior
with
inclined
head
and
low
distinct
voice
spoke
a
few
words
of
prayer
and
settled
herself
in
the
large
chair
behind
which
the
nuns
clustered
in
orderly
rows
the
children
sat
down
at
the
signal
given
and
listened
at
first
with
smiles
as
the
record
of
the
baby
class
were
read
aloud
and
each
mite
stood
up
in
her
place
for
all
the
universe
to
gaze
at
her
while
the
analysis
of
her
month
work
mental
and
moral
sounded
with

so
often
sitting
with

this

it

can

to
which
the

takes

she
finally
compresses
her

and
renders
it
as
kevinnie

is
always
cool
and
unmoved
as
she
stands
up
and
alex
always
looks
at
her
at
this
particular
the
april

she
took
her
glances
more
or

surreptitiously

that
she

to

from

but
her
perfectly
serene
complacency
was
more
or
less
justified
by
the
exaggerated
applause
of
her

at
her
faultless
conduct

the
superior
leant
forward
and
asked
a
question
in
a
low
voice
non
ma

supérieure
non
the
denial
of
a
possible
accusation
of
which
alex
guessed
the
purport
was
emphatic
she
felt
glad
and
relieved
but
had
no
suspicions
as
to
the
indictment
following
on
her
own
name
alexandra
clare
said
mère
alphonsine
sonorously
and
alex
stood
up
she
no
longer
felt
over
the
ordeal
and
was
indifferent
to
the
habitual
litany
of
complaints
as
to
her
unlearnt
lessons
disregard
of
the
rule
of
silence
and
frequent
bad
marks
for
disorder
and
unpunctuality
but
to
the
accusations
which
she
knew
by
heart
and
shared
with
the
majority
of
the
came
a
quite
unexpected
addition
hissed
out
with
a
sort
of
dramatic
horror
by
mère
alphonsine
alex
recherche
kevinnie
sans
cesse
ma
mère
supérieure
only
those
familiar
with
the
code
of
discipline
in
belgium
during
the
years
when
alex
clare
and
her
contemporaries
were
at
school
can
gauge
the
full
heinousness
of
the
offence
gravest
in
the
conventual
decalogue
even
alex
although
she
had
been
scolded
and
punished
and
made
the
subject
of
innumerable
homilies
some
of
them
pityingly
reproachful
and
others
explanatorily
so
on
the
same
question
felt
as
though
she
had
never
before
realized
the
extent
of
her
own
perversion
she
stood
up
her
hands
in
the
regulation
position
pushed
under
the
hideous
pèlerine
that
fell
from
her
stiff
hard
white
collar
to
the
shapeless
waistband
of
her
skirt
the
whole
uniform
carefully
designed
to
conceal
and
obscure
the
lines
of
the
figure
beneath
it
overwhelmed
with
uncomprehending
misery
and
acute
shame
she
heard
two
or
three
of
the
mistresses
add
each
her
quota
for
the
most
part
regretfully
and
with
an
evident
sense
of
duty
overcoming
reluctance
to
the
evidence
against
her
she
seeks
opportunity
to
place
herself
next
to
queenie
at
almost
every
recreation
ma
mère
supérieure
i
am
afraid
that
even
in
the
chapel
she
lets
this
folly
get
the
better
of
her
one
can
see
how
she
lets
herself
go
to
distractions
all
the
time
so
the
charges
went
on
the
summing
up
of
ma
mère
supérieure
was
icily
condemnatory
she
had
tried
every
means
with
alex
had
spoken
to
her
with
kindness
and
tenderness
in
private
had
reasoned
with
her
and
finally
threatened
her
and
now
a
public
denouncement
must
be
tried
since
all
these
means
had
proved
to
be
without
effect
alex
was
principally
conscious
of
the
single
flash
of
reproach
that
had
shot
from
the
eyes
of
queenie
torrance
into
hers
how
silently
and
viciously
queenie
would
resent
this
public
coupling
of
her
immaculate
reputation
with
alex
idiotic
infatuation
only
alex
knew
with
the
frantic
finality
of
youth
she
wondered
whether
she
could
go
on
living
oh
if
only
she
might
die
at
once
without
hearing
further
blame
or
reproach
without
encountering
the
ridicule
of
her
companions
or
the
cold
withdrawal
of
queenie
friendship
alex
cried
herself
sick
with
terror
and
shame
and
utterly
ineffectual
remorse
the
despair
that
invades
an
undeveloped
being
is
the
blackest
in
the
world
because
of
its
utter
want
of
perspective
alex
could
see
nothing
beyond
the
present
she
felt
all
the
weight
of
an
inexpressible
guilt
upon
her
and
all
the
utter
isolation
of
spirit
which
surrounds
the
sinner
who
stands
exposed
and
condemned
she
knew
that
nobody
would
take
her
part
she
was
young
enough
to
reflect
forlornly
that
an
accusation
mattered
nothing
if
unjust
since
the
consciousness
of
innocence
would
sustain
one
serene
and
unfaltering
through
any
ordeal
but
she
had
no
consciousness
of
innocence
she
saw
herself
eternally
different
from
her
companions
eternally
destined
to
lose
her
way
wickedly
and
shamefully
she
supposed
without
volition
of
her
own
she
knew
amongst
those
standards
to
which
the
right
thinking
conformed
and
which
she
only
failed
to
recognize
with
sick
wistfulness
alex
sought
queenie
glance
as
they
came
one
by
one
into
the
refectory
after
the
was
over
queenie
fair
opaque
face
was
as
colourless
as
ever
her
eyes
were
cast
down
frantically
alex
willed
her
to
cast
one
look
of
pity
or
forgiveness
in
her
direction
but
queenie
passed
on
to
the
refectory
where
the
children
meal
was
waiting
for
them
without
a
sign
amidst
all
the
blur
of
emotions
passionate
remorse
and
hopeless
loneliness
which
made
up
alex
schooldays
that
saturday
meal
stood
out
in
its
black
despair
the
choking
attempts
to
swallow
a
mass
of
vegetable
cooking
made
salt
and
sodden
with
her
own
streaming
tears
the
sobs
that
strangled
her
and
broke
in
spite
of
all
her
efforts
into
the
decorous
silence
of
the
refectory
even
the
awed
and
scandalized
glances
that
the
younger
children
cast
at
her
distorted
face
remained
saliently
before
her
memory
for
years
at
last
the
nun
in
charge
rose
from
her
place
at
the
end
of
the
room
and
came
down
and
told
alex
that
she
might
leave
the
table
the
long
progress
down
the
endless
length
of
the
refectory
destroyed
the
last
remnants
of
alex
the
tide
of
emotional
agony
that
swept
over
her
was
to
ebb
and
flow
again
and
many
times
again
but
only
once
or
twice
was
that
mark
to
be
reached
that
bitter
wave
to
engulf
her
and
each
time
add
to
the
undermining
of
that
small
stability
of
spirit
with
which
alex
had
been
endowed
she
left
the
misery
of
that
black
saturday
behind
her
and
was
left
with
her
childish
nerves
a
little
shattered
her
childish
confidence
of
outlook
rather
more
overshadowed
her
childish
strength
less
steady
and
above
all
set
fast
in
her
childish
mind
the
ineradicable
unexplained
conviction
that
because
she
had
loved
queenie
torrance
and
had
been
punished
and
rebuked
for
it
therefore
to
love
was
wrong
iii
queenie
torrance
school
days
in
belgium
went
on
through
the
steamy
days
of
spring
to
the
end
of
term
and
the
looked
forward
to
with
such
frantic
eagerness
even
by
the
children
who
liked
the
convent
best
alex
was
again
bitterly
conscious
of
an
utter
want
of
conformity
setting
her
apart
from
her
the
misery
of
parting
for
eight
weeks
from
queenie
torrance
overwhelmed
her
casually
queenie
said
i
may
not
come
back
next
term
i
shall
be
seventeen
by
then
and
i
do
see
why
i
should
be
at
school
any
longer
if
i
can
get
round
father
what
would
you
do
why
come
out
of
course
said
queenie
i
am
quite
old
enough
and
every
one
says
i
look
older
than
i
am
she
moved
her
head
about
slightly
so
as
to
get
sidelong
views
of
her
own
reflection
in
the
big
there
were
no
at
the
convent
it
was
true
that
in
spite
of
a
skin
smooth
and
unlined
as
a
baby
and
the
childish
semicircular
comb
that
gathered
back
the
short
flaxen
ringlets
from
her
rounded
innocent
brow
queenie
slender
but
very
figure
and
the
unvarying
opaque
pallor
of
her
complexion
made
her
look
infinitely
nearer
maturity
than
the
slim
american
girls
or
giggling
french
and
belgian
ones
alex
gazed
at
her
with
mute
exaggerated
despair
on
her
face
your
parents
will
permit
that
you
make
your
début
at
once
yes
queried
marthe
poupard
as
one
resigned
to
the
incredible
folly
and
weakness
of
british
and
american
parents
i
can
manage
my
father
said
queenie
gently
and
with
the
perfect
conviction
of
experience
in
her
voice
as
the
day
of
the
drew
nearer
discipline
insensibly
relaxed
and
queenie
suddenly
became
less
averse
from
responding
in
some
degree
to
alex
wistful
advances
on
the
last
day
one
of
broiling
heat
the
two
spent
the
afternoon
alone
together
unrebuked
in
a
corner
of
the
great
where
the
pupils
were
scattered
in
groups
feeling
as
though
the
holidays
had
already
begun
i
shall
have
the
journey
with
you
said
alex
piteously
madame
hippolyte
is
taking
us
over
with
one
of
the
said
queenie
naming
the
most
vigilant
of
the
older
french
nuns
so
it
will
be
much
better
if
we
do
talk
together
on
the
boat
you
know
there
will
be
the
three
munroe
girls
as
well
because
they
are
going
to
spend
their
holidays
in
devonshire
or
somewhere
how
do
you
know
it
will
be
madame
hippolyte
said
alex
disconsolately
the
authority
deputed
to
conduct
pupils
on
the
journey
to
and
from
liège
was
one
of
the
many
items
in
the
convent
curriculum
always
shrouded
in
impenetrable
mystery
until
the
actual
moment
of
departure
i
overheard
two
of
them
talking
about
it
in
the
this
morning
placidly
said
queenie
i
kept
behind
the
door
part
of
her
curious
attractiveness
was
that
she
never
attempted
to
disguise
or
deny
certain
practices
which
alex
had
been
taught
to
consider
as
dishonourable
alex
counted
this
as
but
one
more
stone
in
the
edifice
erected
for
the
worship
of
her
idol
it
was
not
until
she
saw
queenie
torrance
long
after
in
other
relations
and
other
surroundings
that
she
dimly
realized
how
much
of
that
streak
of
extraordinary
candour
was
the
direct
product
of
a
magnificently
justified
in
the
potency
of
her
own
attraction
needing
no
enhancement
from
moral
or
mental
attributes
do
you
always
live
in
london
alex
yes
in
clevedon
square
you
know
i
told
you
about
it
queenie
yes
i
know
but
i
only
wondered
if
perhaps
you
had
a
house
in
the
country
as
well
no
father
and
mother
go
to
scotland
in
the
summer
and
generally
they
send
us
to
the
seaside
with
nurse
and
a
governess
or
some
one
i
see
said
queenie
reflectively
she
had
wondered
if
perhaps
the
clares
had
a
country
house
to
which
she
as
a
favourite
school
friend
would
be
asked
to
stay
father
hates
the
country
said
alex
we
are
sure
to
be
in
london
for
a
little
while
in
september
before
i
come
back
here
would
you
would
you
she
gulped
and
clasped
her
hands
nervously
certain
of
lady
isabel
rules
and
recommendations
rushed
to
her
mind
but
she
desperately
tried
to
ignore
them
i
suppose
you
would
not
come
to
tea
with
me
one
day
if
i
were
allowed
to
ask
you
oh
if
your
mother
knew
my
mother
smoothly
queenie
took
her
cue
of
course
mother
wo
let
me
go
to
tea
with
any
one
unless
she
knows
them
herself
but
i
do
know
what
club
does
your
father
belong
to
two
or
three
i
think
said
alex
surprised
he
often
goes
to
arthur
or
the
turf
club
so
does
father
perhaps
we
could
manage
it
that
way
said
queenie
reflectively
she
had
every
intention
of
cultivating
her
friendship
with
alex
clare
in
london
then
you
like
to
come
queenie
breathed
alex
ecstaticly
of
course
i
would
queenie
told
her
affectionately
my
dear
you
know
i
have
hated
all
the
fuss
here
and
our
never
being
allowed
to
speak
a
word
to
one
another
but
what
could
i
do
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
then
queenie
had
really
cared
all
the
time
alex
in
that
moment
was
compensated
for
all
the
tears
and
storms
and
disgraces
of
the
year
that
afternoon
spent
under
the
thick
leafy
boughs
of
the
old
with
queenie
enabled
alex
to
face
with
some
degree
of
courage
the
prospect
of
their
approaching
separation
she
knew
that
any
sign
of
unhappiness
for
such
a
reason
would
be
imputed
to
her
as
by
the
authorities
and
as
unnatural
and
heartless
indifference
to
home
on
the
part
of
her
companions
so
alex
who
had
no
trust
in
any
standards
of
her
own
was
ashamed
of
the
tears
which
she
nightly
stifled
in
her
hard
pillow
and
felt
them
to
be
one
more
of
those
degrading
weaknesses
with
which
her
creator
had
malignantly
endowed
her
in
order
that
she
might
be
as
a
pariah
among
her
fellows
she
felt
no
resentment
only
blind
wonder
and
fatalistic
apathy
nevertheless
all
through
alex
childhood
and
early
girlhood
unhappy
though
she
was
there
dwelt
within
her
a
curious
certainty
that
somewhere
happiness
awaited
her
which
she
and
she
alone
would
have
full
capacity
to
appreciate
side
by
side
with
that
was
her
intense
capacity
for
suffering
but
that
she
was
learning
to
think
of
as
only
a
cruel
tearing
affliction
despised
alike
by
god
and
man
of
the
immense
force
latent
in
the
power
of
intense
feeling
alex
knew
nothing
nor
did
any
of
the
teaching
which
she
received
vouchsafe
to
her
any
illumination
she
and
queenie
and
the
three
munroe
girls
made
the
journey
to
england
with
madame
hippolyte
who
showed
alex
a
marked
kindness
not
usual
with
her
at
fifteen
wakeful
nights
and
storms
of
crying
leave
their
traces
and
alex
and
with
encircled
eyes
was
pitiful
in
her
propitiatory
attempts
to
join
in
the
eager
anticipations
of
holiday
enjoyment
exchanged
between
her
companions
perhaps
thought
the
french
nun
the
little
black
sheep
had
not
a
very
happy
home
a
bad
report
would
follow
alex
to
england
she
well
knew
and
it
might
be
that
the
poor
child
was
dreading
its
results
her
manner
to
alex
grew
gentle
and
compassionate
and
alex
noticed
it
with
a
relieved
uncomprehending
gratitude
that
held
something
abject
in
its
surprised
almost
incredulous
acceptance
of
any
kindness
madame
hippolyte
though
she
sternly
rebuked
herself
for
the
uncharitable
impulse
felt
a
certain
contempt
of
the
way
in
which
her
advances
were
received
she
knew
nothing
of
the
arrogant
manner
that
would
presently
revive
in
the
childish
sense
of
security
in
home
surroundings
and
would
yet
be
merely
another
manifestation
of
the
unbalanced
complexity
that
was
alex
clare
but
as
the
crossing
came
to
an
end
and
they
found
themselves
in
the
train
speeding
towards
london
alex
was
silent
her
small
face
white
and
her
eyes
tragical
the
american
girls
made
delighted
use
of
the
strip
of
in
the
carriage
and
exchanged
predictions
as
to
the
pleased
amazement
that
would
be
caused
by
sadie
growth
the
length
of
marie
plait
of
red
hair
and
diana
added
inches
of
skirt
queenie
torrance
only
glanced
at
her
reflection
once
or
twice
though
an
acute
observer
might
have
seen
that
she
was
not
indifferent
to
the
advantage
of
facing
a
after
the
many
weeks
in
which
none
had
been
available
but
she
was
merely
completely
serene
in
the
immutability
of
her
own
attractiveness
queenie
did
not
need
to
depend
upon
her
looks
which
seldom
or
never
varied
from
soft
colourless
opacity
and
opulence
of
contour
the
pale
heavy
rings
of
her
fair
hair
always
fell
back
in
the
same
way
from
her
open
rounded
forehead
her
hands
with
fingers
broad
at
the
base
and
pointed
gleaming
nails
were
always
cool
and
white
the
americans
were
all
three
pretty
girls
and
something
of
race
that
showed
in
alex
bearing
and
gestures
made
her
remarkable
amongst
any
assembly
of
children
but
it
was
at
queenie
that
every
man
who
passed
the
little
group
in
the
railway
carriage
glanced
a
second
time
good
madame
hippolyte
as
serenely
unaware
of
this
as
only
a
woman
whose
life
had
been
passed
in
a
religious
order
could
be
regarded
queenie
as
by
far
the
least
of
the
responsibilities
on
her
hands
and
did
not
conceal
her
satisfaction
when
marie
and
sadie
and
diana
were
immediately
claimed
at
the
terminus
by
a
group
of
excited
noisy
cousins
and
hurried
away
to
an
enormous
waiting
et
vous
she
demanded
turning
to
the
other
two
dad
come
for
me
said
queenie
confidently
inadvertently
uttering
a
nickname
that
would
not
have
been
permitted
to
the
clare
children
and
was
in
fact
never
in
those
days
heard
in
the
class
of
society
to
which
they
belonged
queenie
shot
an
imperceptible
glance
of
confusion
at
alex
who
was
clinging
speechlessly
to
her
hand
next
moment
she
had
recovered
herself
there
my
father
she
cried
colonel
torrance
was
making
his
way
rapidly
towards
them
a
tall
man
a
trifle
too
conspicuously
well
groomed
a
trifle
too
upright
in
his
bearing
a
trifle
too
remarkable
altogether
with
very
black
moustache
and
eyebrows
and
very
white
hair
he
raised
his
tall
white
hat
with
its
black
band
at
the
sight
of
his
daughter
expanded
his
white
waistcoat
and
grey
with
the
buttonhole
yet
further
and
whipped
off
his
pale
grey
glove
to
take
the
limp
hand
extended
to
him
by
alex
as
queenie
introduced
her
alex
hardly
heard
colonel
torrance
elaborately
courteous
allusion
to
sir
francis
clare
whom
he
had
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
several
times
at
the
club
but
she
wondered
eagerly
if
that
introduction
would
be
considered
sufficient
to
allow
of
her
inviting
queenie
to
clevedon
square
she
felt
as
though
her
spirit
were
being
torn
from
her
body
when
queenie
said
alex
dear
mind
you
write
revoir
ma
compliments
were
exchanged
between
madame
hippolyte
and
father
the
gentleman
flourished
his
top
hat
again
and
then
said
to
his
daughter
my
dear
i
have
a
hansom
waiting
the
impudent
fellow
says
his
horse
wo
stand
i
trust
you
have
no
large
amount
of
luggage
queenie
shook
her
head
smiling
slightly
and
in
a
moment
the
brevity
of
which
seemed
incredible
to
alex
and
left
her
with
an
absolute
suspension
of
physical
faculties
they
disappeared
among
the
crowd
madame
hippolyte
grasped
the
arm
of
her
pupil
but
rouse
yourself
alex
she
said
vigorously
who
is
to
come
for
you
the
carriage
muttered
alex
automatically
well
aware
that
neither
would
lady
isabel
sacrifice
an
hour
of
her
afternoon
to
waiting
at
a
crowded
london
station
in
july
nor
old
nurse
permit
the
other
children
to
do
so
had
they
wished
it
and
where
is
it
this
carriage
sceptically
demanded
madame
hippolyte
harassed
and
exhausted
and
aware
that
she
had
yet
to
find
a
cab
of
sufficiently
cleanly
and
sober
appearance
to
satisfy
her
in
which
she
might
proceed
herself
to
the
convent
in
the
east
of
london
but
presently
alex
came
partially
out
of
her
dream
and
pointed
out
the
brougham
and
bay
horse
and
the
footman
in
buff
livery
at
the
door
but
you
will
not
drive
alone
in
this
cried
the
nun
in
horrified
protest
at
this
exhibition
of
english
want
of
propriety
her
fears
proved
groundless
the
neat
head
of
a
maid
appeared
at
the
brougham
window
and
with
a
sigh
of
infinite
relief
madame
hippolyte
bade
farewell
to
the
last
and
most
anxiously
regarded
of
her
charges
how
you
grown
miss
alex
cried
the
maid
but
her
tone
was
scarcely
one
of
admiration
as
she
gazed
at
the
stooping
shoulders
and
pale
face
under
the
ugly
sailor
hat
of
dark
blue
straw
we
shall
have
to
make
you
look
like
yourself
with
some
of
your
own
clothes
before
your
mamma
sees
you
she
added
kindly
alex
scarcely
answered
and
sat
squeezing
her
hands
together
she
knew
she
must
come
out
of
this
dream
of
misery
that
seemed
to
envelop
her
and
which
was
so
naughty
and
undutiful
of
course
it
was
unnatural
not
to
be
glad
to
come
home
again
and
it
was
as
though
she
had
been
so
very
happy
at
liège
it
was
only
queenie
no
one
must
know
or
she
would
certainly
be
blamed
and
ridiculed
for
her
foolish
and
headlong
fancy
alex
wondered
dimly
why
she
was
so
constituted
as
to
differ
from
every
one
else
the
cab
turned
into
clevedon
square
alex
looked
out
of
the
window
the
big
square
bore
already
the
look
of
desertion
most
associated
in
her
mind
with
summer
in
london
shutters
and
blinds
obscured
the
windows
of
the
first
and
second
floors
of
many
houses
and
against
one
of
the
corner
houses
a
ladder
was
propped
and
an
unwontedly
dazzling
proclaimed
fresh
paint
some
of
the
houses
showed
striped
and
of
scarlet
geraniums
alex
saw
that
there
were
flowers
in
their
own
balcony
as
well
as
an
awning
when
the
carriage
drew
up
at
the
front
door
she
jumped
out
and
replied
hastily
to
the
respectful
greeting
a
slight
feeling
of
excitement
possessing
her
for
the
first
time
at
the
prospect
of
seeing
barbara
and
impressing
her
with
her
added
inches
of
height
she
ran
quickly
up
the
stairs
hoping
that
lady
isabel
would
not
chance
to
come
out
of
the
as
she
went
past
on
the
second
landing
safely
past
the
double
door
of
the
she
paused
a
moment
to
take
breath
and
heard
a
subdued
call
from
overhead
barbara
was
hanging
over
the
banisters
with
archie
hallo
alex
alex
went
up
to
the
schoolroom
landing
and
she
and
barbara
looked
curiously
at
one
another
before
exchanging
a
perfunctory
kiss
alex
suddenly
felt
grubby
and
rather
shabby
in
her
old
last
year
serge
frock
which
had
been
considered
good
enough
for
the
journey
when
she
saw
barbara
in
her
clean
white
muslin
with
a
very
pale
blue
sash
and
her
hair
tied
up
with
a
big
pale
blue
bow
barbara
hair
had
grown
which
annoyed
alex
it
fell
into
one
long
pale
curl
down
her
back
and
no
longer
provoked
a
contrast
with
superior
length
of
shining
wave
deprived
of
the
supervision
of
nurse
with
her
iron
insistence
on
fifty
strokes
of
the
brush
every
night
and
rowland
macassor
on
saturdays
alex
hair
had
somehow
lost
its
shine
and
hung
limply
in
a
tangled
uneven
pigtail
alex
thought
that
barbara
eyed
her
in
a
rather
superior
way
she
felt
much
more
enthusiastic
in
greeting
little
archie
he
was
prettier
and
pinker
and
more
engaging
than
ever
and
alex
felt
glad
that
he
had
not
yet
been
sent
to
school
to
have
his
fair
curls
cropped
and
his
little
velvet
suit
exchanged
for
cricketing
flannels
he
pulled
alex
into
the
schoolroom
with
the
enthusiasm
for
a
new
face
characteristic
of
a
child
to
whom
shyness
is
unknown
and
alex
received
the
curt
greeting
which
she
had
learnt
to
know
would
always
await
her
from
old
nurse
so
you
are
back
from
your
foreign
parts
are
you
miss
alex
nurse
always
said
miss
alex
when
addressing
her
returned
charge
at
first
and
as
invariably
relapsed
into
her
old
peremptory
form
of
address
before
the
end
of
the
evening
my
sakes
child
what
have
they
been
doing
to
you
you
look
like
a
scarecrow
has
she
grown
asked
barbara
jealously
she
knew
that
people
were
always
for
some
mysterious
reason
pleased
when
one
had
grown
grown
yes
and
got
her
back
bent
like
a
bow
said
nurse
vigorously
an
hour
on
the
backboard
what
you
do
every
day
and
bed
at
seven
tonight
have
they
been
giving
you
enough
to
eat
of
course
said
alex
tossing
her
head
she
did
not
like
the
convent
when
she
was
there
but
a
contradictory
instinct
always
made
her
when
at
home
uphold
it
violently
as
a
privileged
spot
to
which
she
alone
had
access
you
look
to
me
nurse
said
unbelievingly
nothing
would
ever
have
persuaded
her
of
what
was
in
fact
the
truth
that
alex
received
more
abundant
more
wholesome
and
infinitely
better
cooked
food
in
belgium
than
in
london
barbara
sat
on
the
end
of
the
sofa
swinging
her
legs
and
fidgetting
with
the
tassel
of
the
have
you
brought
back
any
prizes
alex
she
enquired
negligently
and
alex
replied
with
an
equal
air
of
indifference
one
for
composition
and
i
got
a
certificate
of
proficiency
for
music
this
was
not
at
all
the
way
in
which
she
had
planned
to
make
her
announcements
she
had
thought
that
her
prizes
would
impress
barbara
very
much
and
she
had
foreseen
a
sort
of
small
ceremony
of
display
when
she
would
bring
out
the
big
book
but
barbara
only
nodded
and
presently
said
cedric
has
got
quantities
of
prizes
the
headmaster
wrote
and
told
father
that
he
was
a
of
marked
abilities
and
remarkable
power
of
concentration
and
father
is
going
to
give
him
a
whole
sovereign
but
that
because
he
made
his
century
when
will
he
be
here
next
week
his
holidays
begin
on
tuesday
and
he
got
a
whole
fortnight
longer
than
we
have
we
asked
alex
coldly
how
can
have
holidays
you
not
at
school
i
have
lessons
cried
barbara
angrily
you
know
i
have
and
is
going
to
give
me
a
prize
for
writing
and
a
prize
for
history
and
a
prize
for
application
so
there
prizes
said
alex
scornfully
when
you
all
by
yourself
i
never
heard
such
nonsense
she
no
longer
felt
wretched
and
subdued
but
full
of
irritation
at
barbara
conceit
and
absorption
in
herself
it
not
nonsense
it
is
if
you
been
at
school
you
know
it
was
one
word
more
of
this
and
you
go
to
bed
the
pair
of
you
declared
old
nurse
the
autocrat
whom
alex
had
for
the
moment
forgotten
the
minute
you
set
foot
in
the
place
miss
alex
now
you
just
come
along
and
be
made
fit
to
be
seen
before
your
poor
mamma
and
papa
set
eyes
on
you
looking
like
a
child
as
has
seen
a
brush
or
a
bit
of
soap
for
a
month
of
sundays
useless
to
protest
even
at
this
trenchant
description
of
herself
useless
to
attempt
resistance
during
the
long
process
of
undressing
dressing
again
brushing
and
combing
inspection
of
and
general
dissatisfied
scrutiny
that
ensued
alex
in
a
stiff
clean
frock
the
counterpart
to
her
secret
vexation
of
barbara
stockings
and
new
shoes
that
hurt
her
feet
was
enjoined
to
hold
back
her
shoulders
and
not
poke
and
dispatched
to
the
with
barbara
and
archie
as
soon
as
the
schoolroom
tea
was
over
she
felt
as
though
she
had
never
been
away
no
one
had
asked
her
anything
about
the
convent
and
all
through
tea
barbara
and
archie
had
talked
about
the
coming
holidays
or
had
made
allusions
to
events
of
which
alex
knew
nothing
but
which
had
evidently
been
absorbing
their
attention
for
the
last
few
weeks
they
seemed
to
alex
futile
in
the
extreme
downstairs
lady
isabel
kissed
her
and
said
well
my
darling
very
glad
to
have
you
at
home
again
have
you
been
a
good
girl
this
term
and
brought
back
a
report
that
will
please
papa
and
then
had
turned
to
speak
to
some
one
without
waiting
for
an
answer
alex
sat
beside
her
mother
while
she
talked
to
the
one
remaining
visitor
and
felt
discontented
and
awkward
barbara
and
archie
were
looking
at
pictures
together
in
the
corner
of
the
room
very
quiet
and
well
behaved
the
caller
stayed
late
and
just
as
she
had
gone
sir
francis
came
in
from
his
club
the
faint
familiar
smell
of
tobacco
and
russia
leather
and
expensive
that
seemed
to
pervade
him
striking
alex
with
a
fresh
sense
of
recognition
as
she
rose
to
receive
his
kiss
he
greeted
her
very
kindly
but
alex
was
quite
aware
of
a
dissatisfaction
as
intense
as
though
less
outspoken
than
that
of
old
nurse
as
he
put
up
his
double
and
gazed
at
his
eldest
daughter
we
must
see
if
the
country
or
the
seaside
will
bring
back
some
roses
to
your
cheeks
he
said
in
characteristic
phraseology
but
when
the
children
were
dismissed
from
the
sir
francis
straightened
his
own
broad
back
and
tapped
alex
rounded
hold
yourself
up
my
child
he
said
very
decidedly
i
want
to
see
a
nice
flat
and
straight
back
he
made
no
other
criticism
and
none
was
needed
alex
had
gauged
the
extent
of
his
dismay
iv
holidays
mother
may
i
ask
queenie
torrance
to
tea
alex
had
rehearsed
the
words
so
often
to
herself
that
they
had
almost
become
meaningless
her
heart
beat
thickly
with
the
anticipation
of
a
refusal
when
at
last
she
found
courage
and
opportunity
to
utter
the
little
stilted
phrase
with
a
tongue
that
felt
dry
and
in
a
voice
that
broke
nervously
in
her
throat
what
do
you
say
darling
absently
inquired
lady
isabel
and
alex
had
to
say
it
again
queenie
torrance
said
lady
isabel
still
vaguely
mother
you
remember
i
told
you
about
her
she
is
the
only
other
english
girl
besides
me
at
the
convent
and
she
knows
all
about
father
and
you
and
everything
and
her
father
belongs
to
the
same
club
snobbishness
was
not
in
alex
composition
but
she
adopted
her
standards
eagerly
and
instinctively
in
the
hope
of
gaining
her
point
but
my
darling
what
are
you
talkin
about
you
know
mother
let
you
have
little
girls
here
unless
she
knows
somethin
about
them
give
me
the
little
diamond
brooch
alex
the
one
in
the
silver
box
there
lady
isabel
absorbed
in
the
completion
of
her
evening
toilette
remained
unconscious
of
the
havoc
she
had
wrought
alex
felt
rather
sick
the
intensity
of
feeling
to
which
she
was
a
victim
for
the
most
part
reacted
on
her
physically
though
she
was
as
unconscious
of
this
as
was
her
mother
but
with
the
cunning
borne
of
urgent
desire
alex
knew
that
persistence
which
with
sir
francis
would
invariably
win
a
courteous
rebuke
and
an
immutable
refusal
could
sometimes
bring
forth
rather
querulous
concession
from
lady
isabel
weakness
but
mummy
darling
i
do
want
queenie
to
come
here
and
see
barbara
and
cedric
it
was
not
true
but
alex
was
using
the
arguments
which
she
felt
would
be
most
likely
to
appeal
to
her
mother
she
wants
to
know
them
so
much
and
and
i
saw
her
father
at
the
station
when
we
arrived
and
he
was
very
polite
who
was
with
you
i
do
like
your
speakin
like
that
to
people
whom
father
and
i
do
know
oh
it
was
only
a
second
said
alex
hastily
madame
hippolyte
was
there
and
colonel
torrance
just
came
up
to
take
queenie
away
torrance
torrance
said
lady
isabel
reflectively
who
torrance
the
question
made
alex
heart
sink
afresh
it
was
one
which
coming
from
her
parents
she
heard
applied
to
new
acquaintances
or
occasionally
to
protégés
for
whom
some
intimate
friends
might
crave
the
favour
of
an
invitation
to
one
of
the
big
clare
crushes
during
the
season
and
the
inquiry
was
seldom
one
which
boded
well
for
the
regard
in
which
the
newcomer
would
be
held
mother
you
like
her
i
think
really
and
truly
you
would
awfully
pretty
alex
lady
isabel
for
once
sounded
really
angry
i
so
sorry
it
slipped
out
i
did
mean
it
i
never
really
say
it
i
never
mother
alex
became
agitated
trying
to
fend
off
the
accusation
which
she
foresaw
was
coming
i
suppose
you
learn
those
horrid
slang
words
from
this
girl
taken
such
a
violent
fancy
to
no
no
well
darling
both
father
and
i
are
very
much
disgusted
with
some
of
the
tricks
you
picked
up
at
the
convent
and
you
have
to
find
some
way
of
curin
yourself
before
you
put
up
your
hair
and
come
out
as
for
the
way
you
holdin
yourself
i
simply
shocked
at
it
and
so
is
your
father
i
shall
see
about
sendin
you
to
macpherson
gymnasium
for
proper
exercises
as
soon
as
you
get
back
from
the
country
lady
isabel
gazed
with
dissatisfaction
at
her
daughter
you
must
be
a
disappointment
to
us
darling
she
said
you
know
you
be
coming
out
in
another
two
years
time
and
it
so
important
she
broke
off
eyeing
alex
anxiously
already
she
had
forgotten
the
question
of
the
invitation
to
queenie
torrance
alex
in
an
agony
rushed
recklessly
at
her
point
but
mother
you
have
said
yet
may
i
ask
queenie
on
saturday
you
know
we
sha
be
here
after
saturday
may
i
lady
isabel
moved
to
the
door
with
more
annoyance
than
she
often
displayed
my
dear
child
you
old
enough
to
know
that
these
things
are
done
and
besides
i
already
said
no
father
and
i
dislike
these
sudden
violent
friendships
in
any
case
run
along
upstairs
my
darling
and
if
you
and
barbara
want
a
little
on
saturday
you
may
ask
those
nice
fitzgerald
children
tell
nurse
that
i
said
you
might
lady
isabel
kissed
alex
and
went
downstairs
the
trailing
folds
of
her
evening
dress
carefully
held
up
in
one
hand
as
she
descended
the
broad
curving
stairs
from
the
upper
landing
alex
watched
her
for
a
few
moments
her
face
burning
with
mortification
and
the
effort
to
restrain
her
tears
then
she
broke
into
sobs
and
ran
away
upstairs
mother
had
not
understood
in
the
very
least
she
never
understood
never
would
understand
no
one
understood
alex
felt
as
so
often
that
she
would
barter
everything
she
possessed
for
the
finding
of
some
one
who
would
understand
in
her
craving
for
she
talked
to
barbara
about
queenie
torrance
but
represented
their
intercourse
as
that
of
an
equal
friendship
with
unbounded
affection
and
confidence
on
both
sides
barbara
listened
believingly
enough
and
even
exhibited
signs
of
a
faint
jealousy
and
gradually
alex
inventions
brought
her
a
slight
feeling
of
comfort
as
though
the
ideal
friendship
which
she
so
readily
described
to
her
little
sister
must
have
some
real
existence
the
old
sense
of
supremacy
began
to
assert
itself
again
and
barbara
fell
into
the
old
ways
of
following
alex
lead
in
everything
she
lost
her
shrinking
convent
manner
born
of
the
sense
of
helpless
insecurity
and
when
cedric
return
brought
barbara
back
to
her
earliest
allegiance
the
league
which
she
and
cedric
had
always
formed
against
alex
overbearing
ways
in
the
nursery
her
defection
was
resented
by
her
sister
with
no
lack
of
spirit
idiotic
little
just
because
cedric
come
you
pretend
you
only
care
for
cricket
and
nonsense
like
that
as
though
he
wanted
to
play
cricket
with
a
little
girl
like
you
he
does
mind
playing
cricket
with
me
he
says
i
can
bowl
very
well
for
a
girl
and
it
gives
him
practice
anyway
said
barbara
shrewdly
he
likes
talking
about
it
and
how
am
i
to
be
his
pal
unless
i
understand
what
he
means
you
not
to
say
that
horrid
vulgar
word
you
know
mother
would
be
very
angry
i
shall
say
what
i
like
it
not
your
business
you
a
prig
ever
since
you
went
to
that
hateful
convent
you
not
to
speak
to
me
like
that
you
not
shouted
alex
stamping
her
foot
the
dispute
degenerated
into
one
of
the
furious
quarrels
of
their
nursery
days
and
alex
completely
mastered
by
her
temper
flew
at
barbara
as
she
had
not
done
since
they
were
seven
and
ten
years
old
respectively
and
hit
her
and
pulled
her
long
curl
viciously
barbara
stood
on
the
instant
she
had
infinitely
more
than
alex
and
a
strong
instinct
for
being
invariably
in
the
right
but
she
uttered
shriek
upon
piercing
shriek
that
brought
old
nurse
but
astonishingly
swift
upon
the
scene
and
reduced
alex
to
dire
disgrace
for
the
rest
of
the
day
she
cried
again
suffering
remorse
and
shame
that
seemed
almost
unbearable
and
told
herself
hopelessly
that
she
could
never
be
good
anywhere
such
an
example
to
your
little
sister
who
never
given
me
a
trouble
all
the
while
you
been
away
nurse
declared
at
the
end
of
a
long
monologue
during
which
alex
learnt
and
implicitly
believed
that
a
temper
like
hers
unbridled
at
the
age
of
fifteen
must
have
irrevocably
passed
beyond
one
own
control
into
that
of
the
devil
himself
when
you
remember
nurse
wound
up
how
you
nearly
killed
her
with
your
naughty
ways
and
had
her
on
her
back
for
a
year
and
she
with
never
a
word
of
complaint
against
you
poor
lamb
one
would
think
you
want
to
make
it
up
to
her
instead
of
hitting
one
as
never
even
hits
you
back
but
you
no
heart
alex
as
i
always
said
and
always
shall
say
about
you
heart
or
no
heart
old
nurse
thoroughly
succeeded
in
working
upon
feelings
and
in
sobbing
abjection
she
begged
barbara
forgiveness
barbara
agreeably
conscious
of
martyrdom
found
it
easy
to
grant
with
a
gentleness
that
redoubled
alex
shame
and
the
incident
except
for
alex
swollen
eyes
and
subdued
tones
next
day
was
closed
cedric
characteristically
remained
oblivious
of
it
throughout
he
had
grown
into
a
boy
not
tall
for
his
eleven
years
but
sturdy
and
well
set
up
with
steady
eyes
behind
the
spectacles
that
his
short
sight
still
necessitated
to
the
grief
of
lady
isabel
his
mind
was
obsessed
by
cricket
and
from
his
conversation
one
might
have
deduced
that
no
other
occupation
had
filled
the
summer
term
nevertheless
he
brought
home
a
large
pile
of
prizes
and
a
report
that
caused
sir
francis
to
smile
his
excessively
rare
smile
and
utter
two
words
that
cedric
never
forgot
and
never
mentioned
to
any
one
else
well
done
two
days
after
cedric
return
sir
francis
and
lady
isabel
went
away
for
their
annual
round
of
country
visits
and
old
nurse
with
the
new
young
nurse
who
devoted
her
services
exclusively
to
pamela
and
a
to
wait
upon
them
went
with
the
children
to
stay
at
fiveapples
farm
in
devonshire
the
farm
was
glorious
the
girls
might
run
about
the
and
in
the
lanes
though
nurse
mindful
of
lady
isabel
injunction
as
to
complexion
and
the
danger
of
freckles
always
insisted
on
hats
and
gloves
and
cedric
followed
everywhere
like
a
little
shadow
by
archie
rode
the
farm
horses
and
even
went
into
exeter
to
market
with
farmer
young
on
fridays
alex
insensibly
began
to
cease
her
preoccupied
outlook
for
letters
from
queenie
and
the
convent
life
began
to
relax
its
hold
on
her
memory
and
imagination
as
older
influences
resumed
their
sway
correspondence
with
queenie
had
never
been
satisfactory
although
not
forbidden
alex
knew
that
it
was
considered
a
foolish
and
undesirable
practice
and
that
her
letters
although
as
a
matter
of
fact
generally
given
to
her
unopened
were
always
liable
to
supervision
by
the
authorities
as
a
matter
of
course
old
nurse
might
be
unable
to
read
although
no
one
had
ever
heard
her
admit
as
much
but
she
always
slit
open
any
letter
that
came
for
alex
or
barbara
and
made
a
feint
of
perusing
it
unless
the
envelope
as
rarely
happened
bore
lady
isabel
superscription
in
the
absence
of
your
mamma
said
old
nurse
severely
and
she
never
failed
to
refuse
unhesitatingly
any
request
from
alex
to
be
allowed
to
go
to
the
post
office
for
the
purpose
of
buying
stamps
queenie
had
only
written
twice
the
second
letter
reached
alex
at
fiveapples
farm
when
she
had
nearly
given
up
hope
for
it
dear
alex
thank
you
very
much
for
your
letters
it
is
nice
of
you
to
write
to
me
so
often
please
forgive
me
for
not
writing
oftener
to
you
but
i
have
got
much
time
it
so
hot
in
london
now
you
are
very
lucky
to
be
in
the
country
i
think
we
shall
go
soon
but
i
do
know
yet
where
we
shall
go
do
you
know
that
you
are
quite
near
where
the
munroes
are
staying
diana
wrote
to
me
the
other
day
perhaps
you
will
see
them
please
give
them
my
love
do
you
remember
how
funny
diana
was
at
her
singing
lessons
i
often
think
of
the
convent
do
you
now
i
must
end
alex
with
fond
love
from
your
affectionate
school
friend
queenie
i
am
not
going
back
next
term
i
am
very
glad
except
for
not
seeing
you
i
hope
we
shall
see
each
other
in
london
alex
read
and
the
postscript
and
tried
not
to
think
that
the
rest
of
the
letter
was
disappointing
your
great
friend
does
write
you
nearly
such
long
letters
as
you
write
her
observed
barbara
eyeing
the
four
small
sheets
which
queenie
unformed
curiously
writing
had
barely
succeeded
in
covering
she
has
got
time
said
alex
quickly
and
defensively
more
like
she
got
a
sensible
governess
who
does
let
her
waste
good
pen
and
paper
on
such
rubbish
old
nurse
severely
pointed
the
moral
what
do
girls
want
to
write
to
one
another
for
said
cedric
they
ca
have
anything
to
say
barbara
who
was
secretly
curious
seized
the
opportunity
what
does
she
write
about
alex
alex
would
have
liked
to
tell
them
to
mind
their
own
business
but
she
knew
that
any
accusation
of
making
mysteries
would
bring
down
wrath
upon
her
and
as
likely
as
not
the
confiscation
of
the
letter
she
read
it
aloud
hastily
with
a
pretence
of
skipping
here
and
there
leaving
out
the
dear
alex
at
the
beginning
and
the
whole
of
the
last
sentence
and
the
postscript
i
suppose
you
left
out
all
the
darlings
and
the
loves
and
kisses
cedric
remarked
scornfully
more
from
conventionality
than
anything
else
alex
was
not
averse
to
having
it
supposed
that
queenie
had
been
more
lavish
with
endearments
than
she
had
in
reality
shown
herself
who
are
the
munroes
asked
barbara
are
they
nice
the
american
girls
who
crossed
from
liège
with
me
i
remember
now
they
were
going
to
spend
their
holidays
with
an
aunt
somewhere
in
devonshire
perhaps
we
shall
see
them
how
old
are
they
sadie
and
diana
are
much
older
than
you
alex
told
her
crushingly
in
fact
they
older
than
i
am
but
the
little
one
marie
is
only
twelve
where
does
the
aunt
live
how
should
i
know
said
alex
she
reflected
bitterly
that
even
if
her
schoolmates
should
ever
meet
her
in
devonshire
it
would
be
impossible
for
her
to
make
any
advance
to
them
with
old
nurse
even
more
strictly
mindful
of
the
conventions
than
lady
isabel
but
for
once
it
seemed
as
though
fate
were
on
alex
side
i
hear
wrote
lady
isabel
in
one
of
her
hasty
collective
letters
addressed
impartially
to
my
darling
children
that
alfred
cardew
who
lives
at
a
very
pretty
house
called
trevose
not
more
than
a
few
miles
from
where
you
are
has
her
three
little
nieces
with
her
for
the
holidays
and
that
they
are
at
the
same
convent
as
alex
so
if
you
like
darlings
as
i
know
alfred
cardew
quite
well
you
may
ask
nurse
to
let
you
arrange
some
little
picnic
or
other
and
invite
the
three
children
alex
taken
by
surprise
felt
doubtful
she
did
not
know
whether
she
wanted
to
expose
herself
to
the
criticisms
which
she
thought
disparagingly
gazing
round
at
her
brothers
and
sisters
and
their
autocratic
guardian
they
would
inevitably
call
forth
from
strangers
suppose
they
came
and
barbara
was
shy
and
foolish
and
cedric
doggedly
bored
and
then
the
munroes
went
back
to
liège
next
term
and
laughed
at
alex
and
told
the
other
girls
what
queer
relations
she
had
and
again
thought
alex
nurse
would
probably
think
the
americanisms
which
had
amused
queenie
and
alex
at
the
convent
merely
vulgar
and
barbara
and
cedric
would
wonder
you
extraordinary
alex
said
barbara
petulantly
you
always
talking
about
your
friends
at
the
convent
and
saying
how
nice
they
are
and
then
when
there
a
chance
of
our
seeing
them
too
you
do
seem
to
want
to
have
them
yes
i
do
said
alex
hastily
and
consoled
herself
with
the
reflection
that
very
likely
the
plan
would
never
materialize
but
as
luck
would
have
it
alex
the
very
next
day
saw
sadie
munroe
waving
to
her
excitedly
from
the
carriage
where
she
was
driving
with
a
very
lady
obviously
the
aunt
the
following
week
a
charming
note
invited
alex
barbara
cedric
and
archie
to
lunch
and
spend
the
afternoon
at
trevose
they
should
be
fetched
in
the
and
driven
back
after
tea
at
least
alex
reflected
thankfully
old
nurse
would
not
be
there
to
put
her
to
shame
about
archie
with
his
clean
sailor
suit
and
shining
curls
she
felt
no
anxiety
he
was
always
a
success
but
she
inspected
cedric
and
especially
barbara
with
anxiety
the
day
was
a
very
hot
one
and
cedric
in
cricketing
flannels
looked
sufficiently
like
every
other
boy
of
his
age
and
standing
to
reassure
his
critical
sister
but
barbara
surely
the
three
pretty
americans
would
despise
little
pale
plain
barbara
with
her
one
ridiculous
curl
of
pale
hair
and
the
big
babyish
bow
of
blue
ribbon
against
which
alex
had
protested
so
vigorously
in
her
own
case
that
nurse
had
finally
substituted
black
no
amount
of
protest
however
even
had
alex
dared
to
offer
it
would
have
induced
nurse
to
depart
from
the
rule
which
decreed
that
the
sisters
should
be
dressed
alike
and
barbara
clean
cotton
frock
was
the
counterpart
of
alex
alex
thought
the
similarity
ridiculous
and
hated
the
twin
leghorn
hats
each
with
a
precisely
similar
wreath
round
the
crown
of
thick
pale
blue
of
which
the
clusters
were
unrelieved
by
any
blade
or
hint
of
green
even
their
brown
shoes
and
stockings
and
brown
gauntlet
gloves
were
alike
alex
felt
disgusted
at
the
aspect
which
she
thought
they
must
present
and
was
unable
to
enjoy
the
drive
in
the
cardew
had
sent
over
for
them
she
could
not
have
told
whether
she
was
more
apprehensive
of
the
effect
barbara
and
cedric
might
have
on
the
munroes
or
the
munroes
on
barbara
and
cedric
what
do
you
suppose
we
shall
do
all
the
afternoon
asked
barbara
she
was
in
one
of
her
rare
moods
of
excitement
and
her
futile
chattering
and
unceasing
questions
filled
alex
with
impatience
the
two
were
on
the
verge
of
a
quarrel
by
the
time
the
last
hill
was
reached
then
came
a
long
shady
avenue
with
two
pretty
little
lodges
and
a
wide
stone
gate
and
the
groom
drove
the
pony
smartly
round
a
triangular
gravel
sweep
which
lay
before
the
arched
entrance
to
the
big
georgian
house
sadie
marie
and
diana
were
sitting
on
the
low
stone
wall
that
divided
the
drive
from
what
looked
like
a
wilderness
of
pink
and
red
roses
and
alex
noticed
with
relief
that
they
were
all
three
dressed
exactly
alike
in
white
muslin
frocks
although
she
also
saw
that
in
spite
of
the
blazing
sun
they
were
without
hats
or
gloves
they
jumped
off
the
wall
as
the
drew
up
before
the
door
and
greeted
the
clare
children
eagerly
and
with
no
trace
of
shyness
v
other
people
it
seemed
to
alex
that
the
day
was
going
to
be
a
success
and
her
spirits
rose
she
was
rather
surprised
to
see
that
diana
munroe
who
was
seventeen
wore
her
hair
in
a
thick
plait
twisted
round
the
crown
of
her
head
and
asked
her
almost
at
once
have
you
put
your
hair
up
diana
are
you
going
to
out
oh
no
it
come
down
again
at
the
end
of
the
holidays
for
my
last
term
only
aunt
esther
likes
to
see
it
that
way
there
aunt
esther
at
the
bottom
of
the
rose
garden
looking
over
the
terrace
wall
they
saw
people
men
in
white
flannels
and
ladies
in
thin
summer
dresses
alex
was
rather
pleased
she
had
always
been
more
of
a
success
with
her
mother
friends
than
with
her
own
contemporaries
from
the
time
of
her
nursery
days
when
she
had
been
sent
for
to
the
on
the
at
home
afternoons
but
though
cardew
looked
up
and
waved
her
hand
to
the
group
of
children
on
the
terrace
she
did
not
appear
to
expect
them
to
join
the
party
and
the
interval
before
lunch
was
spent
in
the
display
of
white
rabbits
and
at
first
alex
watched
barbara
rather
nervously
wondering
if
she
would
be
shy
and
foolish
and
disgrace
her
but
barbara
no
longer
by
an
elder
sister
who
outshone
her
in
every
way
had
acquired
a
surprising
amount
of
alex
was
not
even
certain
that
she
approved
of
the
ease
with
which
her
little
sister
talked
and
exclaimed
over
the
pet
animals
asking
diana
whether
she
might
pick
up
the
and
hold
them
without
so
much
as
waiting
for
a
lead
from
alex
of
course
you
may
diana
exclaimed
here
you
are
she
distributed
impartially
and
earnestly
consulted
cedric
as
to
the
bald
patch
on
the
angora
rabbit
head
as
they
went
back
towards
the
house
sadie
munroe
said
to
him
do
you
mind
not
having
any
other
boys
here
only
girls
i
afraid
dull
for
you
but
aunt
esther
boys
will
be
here
after
lunch
only
they
had
to
go
over
and
play
tennis
with
some
people
this
morning
it
was
all
settled
before
we
knew
you
were
coming
but
cedric
did
not
seem
to
mind
at
all
at
lunch
archie
as
alex
had
known
he
would
be
was
an
immediate
success
even
cardew
who
was
bald
and
looked
through
alex
and
barbara
and
cedric
without
seeing
them
when
he
shook
hands
with
them
patted
archie
curls
and
said
hullo
bubbles
come
and
sit
next
to
me
you
darling
said
cardew
and
you
shall
have
two
helpings
of
everything
it
was
a
very
long
and
alex
found
herself
placed
between
sadie
and
a
gentleman
to
whom
she
talked
in
a
manner
which
seemed
to
herself
to
be
very
and
efficient
barbara
was
on
the
same
side
of
the
table
and
invisible
to
her
but
she
saw
cedric
opposite
quite
eagerly
talking
to
marie
munroe
which
rather
surprised
alex
who
thought
that
her
brother
would
despise
all
little
girls
of
twelve
quite
a
number
of
people
whose
names
alex
did
not
know
asked
her
about
lady
isabel
and
she
answered
their
inquiries
readily
pleased
to
show
off
her
and
the
gulf
separating
her
from
the
childishness
of
barbara
who
was
giggling
almost
all
through
lunch
in
a
manner
that
would
unhesitatingly
have
been
qualified
by
her
parents
as
lunch
was
nearly
over
when
the
two
schoolboy
sons
of
the
house
came
rushing
in
hot
and
excited
and
demanding
a
share
of
dessert
and
coffee
barbarians
tranquilly
said
cardew
sit
down
quietly
now
eric
and
noel
i
hope
you
said
d
you
do
to
every
one
they
had
not
done
so
but
both
made
a
sort
of
circular
salutation
and
the
elder
boy
dropped
into
a
chair
next
to
alex
while
eric
went
to
sit
beside
his
mother
noel
cardew
was
fifteen
a
english
boy
his
fairness
burned
almost
to
and
with
a
very
noticeable
cast
in
one
of
his
eyes
alex
looked
at
him
furtively
and
wondered
what
she
could
talk
about
noel
spared
her
all
trouble
do
you
ever
take
photographs
he
inquired
earnestly
i
just
got
a
camera
one
of
those
sorts
and
a
tripod
size
i
want
to
do
some
groups
after
lunch
i
got
a
for
developing
the
you
know
he
talked
rapidly
and
eagerly
half
turned
round
in
his
chair
so
as
almost
to
face
alex
and
she
tried
to
feel
flattered
by
the
exclusive
monologue
she
knew
nothing
about
photography
but
uttered
little
sympathetic
ejaculations
and
put
one
or
two
timid
questions
which
noel
for
the
most
part
hardly
seemed
to
hear
when
cardew
at
length
rose
from
her
place
he
turned
from
alex
at
once
in
the
midst
of
what
he
was
saying
and
demanded
vehemently
ca
we
have
a
group
on
the
terrace
now
do
let
me
do
a
group
on
the
terrace
the
light
will
be
just
right
now
dear
boy
you
really
must
become
a
nuisance
with
that
camera
of
yours
though
he
really
extraordinarily
clever
at
it
said
his
mother
in
a
perfectly
audible
aside
would
it
bore
you
all
very
much
to
be
victimized
you
wo
keep
us
sitting
in
the
glare
too
long
will
you
dear
boy
almost
every
one
protested
at
the
suggestion
of
being
photographed
but
while
a
good
many
of
the
gentlemen
of
the
party
disappeared
noiselessly
and
rapidly
before
the
group
could
be
formed
all
the
ladies
began
to
straighten
their
hats
and
pull
or
push
at
their
fringes
noel
kept
them
waiting
in
the
hot
sun
for
what
seemed
a
long
while
and
alex
reflected
rather
gloomily
that
cardew
showed
a
tolerance
of
his
inconvenient
passion
for
photography
that
would
certainly
not
have
been
approved
by
her
own
parents
at
last
it
was
over
and
sadie
jumped
up
crying
now
we
can
have
some
proper
games
what
shall
we
play
at
do
get
her
aunt
said
smiling
and
nodding
as
she
moved
away
do
you
like
croquet
diana
asked
and
to
alex
disappointment
they
embarked
upon
a
long
wearisome
game
she
was
not
a
good
player
nor
was
barbara
but
cedric
surprised
them
all
by
the
brilliant
ease
with
which
he
piloted
marie
munroe
and
himself
to
victory
i
say
that
jolly
good
eric
and
noel
said
and
gazed
at
their
junior
with
respect
alex
felt
pleased
but
rather
impatient
too
and
wished
that
it
were
she
who
was
distinguishing
herself
when
they
played
however
her
opportunity
came
she
could
run
faster
than
any
of
the
other
girls
at
liège
and
when
diana
suggested
picking
up
sides
she
added
alex
runs
much
faster
than
any
of
us
she
better
be
captain
for
one
side
and
noel
the
other
noel
looked
as
though
his
own
headship
were
a
matter
of
course
but
alex
felt
constrained
to
say
oh
no
not
me
you
diana
would
you
rather
not
very
well
cedric
then
hurry
up
and
choose
your
sides
boys
you
start
cedric
i
have
marie
said
cedric
unhesitatingly
and
the
little
girl
skipped
over
beside
him
with
undisguised
alacrity
noel
noel
jerked
his
head
in
the
direction
of
alex
you
he
said
she
was
immensely
surprised
and
flattered
connecting
his
choice
with
the
same
attraction
that
had
made
him
sit
beside
her
at
lunch
and
not
with
her
own
reported
prowess
as
a
runner
cedric
reputation
for
gallantry
suffered
somewhat
in
his
next
selections
which
fell
with
characteristic
common
sense
on
brother
eric
and
upon
barbara
noel
took
sadie
and
diana
and
they
drew
lots
for
archie
the
game
proved
long
and
exciting
played
all
over
the
terrace
and
shrubbery
alex
screamed
and
laughed
with
the
others
and
enjoyed
herself
although
she
found
time
to
wish
that
barbara
were
not
so
stupid
and
priggish
about
keeping
on
her
gloves
because
old
nurse
had
said
she
must
and
to
wonder
very
much
why
cedric
appeared
so
pleased
with
the
society
of
chattering
marie
whose
side
he
never
left
presently
as
she
was
looking
for
somewhere
to
hide
noel
cardew
joined
her
come
on
with
me
i
know
a
place
where
they
never
find
us
he
told
her
and
led
her
on
to
where
a
very
small
disused
was
in
a
clump
of
flowering
shrubs
noel
pushed
open
the
door
with
very
little
effort
and
they
crept
into
the
and
sat
on
the
floor
pulling
the
door
to
behind
them
noel
whispered
softly
is
it
cool
in
here
i
hot
so
am
i
alex
was
wondering
nervously
what
she
could
talk
about
to
interest
him
and
to
make
him
go
on
liking
her
evidently
he
did
like
her
or
he
would
not
have
sat
next
her
at
lunch
and
told
her
about
his
photography
and
afterwards
have
chosen
her
for
his
partner
at
alex
though
she
did
not
know
it
possessed
a
combination
that
is
utterly
fatal
to
any
charm
she
was
unfeignedly
astonished
that
any
one
should
be
attracted
by
her
and
at
the
same
time
agonizedly
anxious
to
be
liked
she
wanted
now
wildly
and
nervously
to
maintain
the
interest
which
she
thought
she
had
excited
in
her
companion
she
found
the
silence
unbearable
noel
would
think
her
dull
or
imagine
that
she
was
bored
is
this
where
you
do
your
developing
she
asked
in
an
interested
voice
although
she
remembered
perfectly
that
he
had
said
he
used
a
for
his
no
we
got
the
for
that
why
there
would
be
room
to
stand
up
in
here
sometimes
i
get
my
things
developed
and
printed
for
me
at
a
shop
you
know
chemists
will
generally
do
it
for
one
though
of
course
i
prefer
doing
my
own
but
there
is
time
except
in
the
holidays
and
then
one
always
running
short
of
some
stuff
or
other
the
other
day
i
ruined
a
simply
splendid
group
awfully
good
it
would
have
been
mother
and
a
whole
lot
of
people
out
on
the
steps
like
we
were
today
you
know
he
paused
for
sheer
lack
of
breath
i
hope
the
one
you
took
today
will
be
good
said
alex
her
heart
beating
quickly
oh
yes
sure
to
be
with
a
day
like
this
some
fellows
say
you
can
get
just
as
much
effect
on
a
dull
day
using
a
larger
stop
but
of
course
that
all
nonsense
really
i
say
i
not
boring
you
am
i
he
hardly
waited
to
hear
her
impassioned
negative
before
going
on
still
discussing
photographic
methods
it
was
quite
true
that
alex
was
not
bored
although
she
was
hardly
listening
to
what
he
said
but
his
voice
went
on
and
on
and
it
flattered
her
that
he
should
want
to
talk
to
her
so
exclusively
as
though
secure
of
her
sympathy
and
they
say
will
be
the
next
thing
i
believe
one
could
get
some
jolly
good
effects
down
here
young
eric
is
all
for
messing
about
with
beastly
paints
and
stuff
but
i
do
agree
with
that
oh
no
my
plan
is
to
get
hold
of
a
real
outfit
as
soon
as
they
get
the
thing
perfected
and
then
be
one
of
the
pioneers
you
know
i
say
i
hope
you
do
think
this
is
awful
cheek
oh
no
this
is
a
bad
place
for
experiments
i
will
say
you
see
you
can
get
the
sea
and
quite
decent
scenery
and
any
amount
of
view
and
stuff
i
say
what
ages
they
are
finding
us
he
broke
off
suddenly
alex
felt
deeply
mortified
evidently
noel
was
bored
after
all
but
in
another
minute
he
began
to
talk
again
i
should
be
surprised
if
one
of
these
days
i
tried
my
hand
at
doing
sort
of
book
stuff
you
know
photographs
for
illustrations
i
believe
it
going
to
pay
no
end
what
sort
of
things
oh
scenery
you
know
and
perhaps
houses
and
things
sure
i
not
boring
you
no
indeed
i
very
interested
it
is
rather
interesting
noel
agreed
simply
another
thing
i
keen
on
is
swimming
rather
different
you
say
but
then
one
ca
do
one
thing
all
the
time
and
of
course
the
swimming
is
first
class
at
school
i
went
in
for
some
competition
and
stuff
last
term
high
diving
you
know
oh
did
you
win
ca
say
i
did
young
eric
got
a
cup
of
sorts
racing
but
i
just
missed
the
diving
some
day
i
shall
have
another
try
i
daresay
you
know
i
got
rather
a
funny
theory
about
swimming
i
do
know
whether
you
see
what
i
mean
at
all
in
fact
i
daresay
it
sound
more
or
less
mad
to
you
but
believe
we
do
it
the
wrong
way
oh
said
alex
wishing
at
the
same
time
that
she
could
divest
herself
of
the
eternal
monosyllable
do
tell
me
about
it
well
it
a
bit
difficult
to
explain
but
think
we
all
taught
the
wrong
way
to
begin
with
it
does
seem
to
have
occurred
to
any
one
to
look
at
the
way
swim
alex
thought
that
noel
must
really
be
very
original
and
clever
and
tried
to
feel
more
flattered
than
ever
at
being
selected
as
the
recipient
of
his
theories
i
believe
the
whole
thing
could
be
revolutionized
and
done
much
better
but
i
afraid
i
always
simply
chockfull
of
ideas
of
that
kind
but
that
so
interesting
alex
said
not
consciously
insincere
do
you
have
all
sorts
of
ideas
like
that
yourself
he
asked
eagerly
filling
her
with
a
moment
anticipation
that
he
was
about
to
give
the
conversation
a
personal
turn
think
it
makes
life
so
much
more
interesting
if
one
goes
into
things
not
just
stay
on
the
surface
you
know
but
go
into
the
things
are
done
alex
thought
she
heard
some
one
coming
towards
their
and
wanted
to
tell
noel
to
stop
talking
or
they
would
be
found
but
she
checked
the
impulse
fearful
lest
he
should
think
her
unsympathetic
the
dogmatic
schoolboy
voice
went
on
and
on
swimming
photography
cricket
and
then
photography
again
alex
determined
to
feel
pleased
and
interested
could
only
contribute
an
occasional
monosyllable
sometimes
only
an
inarticulate
sound
expressive
of
sympathy
and
at
the
end
of
it
all
when
she
was
half
proud
and
half
irritated
at
the
thought
that
they
must
have
been
sitting
there
in
the
for
at
least
an
hour
noel
exclaimed
i
say
they
slow
finding
us
i
should
think
it
must
be
quite
should
you
how
would
it
be
if
we
came
out
now
yes
let
said
alex
trying
to
keep
the
mortification
out
of
her
voice
they
emerged
into
the
sunlight
again
and
noel
pulled
out
his
watch
it
only
a
quarter
past
four
i
thought
it
would
be
much
later
he
remarked
candidly
i
wonder
where
they
all
are
i
expect
they
want
to
know
where
we
been
hiding
but
you
wo
give
it
away
will
you
it
a
jolly
good
place
and
the
others
do
know
about
it
i
wo
tell
alex
revived
a
little
at
the
idea
of
being
entrusted
with
a
secret
do
you
often
play
oh
just
to
amuse
the
girls
in
the
summer
holidays
they
spent
the
last
three
summers
with
us
you
know
next
year
i
suppose
they
go
to
america
lucky
kids
i
love
to
go
to
america
would
you
alex
asked
with
considerable
pretty
well
i
tell
you
what
i
really
like
to
do
i
shall
do
it
one
day
too
make
a
regular
tour
of
england
with
a
camera
i
do
know
whether
you
think
it
nonsense
of
course
but
my
idea
has
always
been
that
people
go
rushing
abroad
to
see
other
countries
before
they
really
know
their
own
now
my
plan
would
be
that
i
simply
start
at
land
end
in
cornwall
just
taking
each
principal
town
as
it
came
on
my
way
you
know
and
exploring
thoroughly
i
should
mind
going
off
the
main
track
you
know
if
i
heard
of
any
little
place
that
had
an
old
church
or
castle
or
something
worth
looking
at
i
do
know
whether
you
at
all
keen
on
old
buildings
oh
yes
alex
said
doubtfully
i
seen
liège
and
louvain
in
belgium
ah
but
i
talking
about
english
places
noel
interrupted
her
inexorably
of
course
the
foreign
ones
are
splendid
too
and
i
mean
to
run
over
and
have
a
look
at
them
some
day
but
my
theory
is
that
one
ought
to
see
something
of
one
own
land
first
now
take
devonshire
there
are
simply
millions
of
old
churches
in
devonshire
and
what
i
should
do
would
be
to
have
a
with
me
and
simply
jot
down
my
impressions
then
with
photographs
one
might
get
out
quite
a
sort
of
record
if
you
know
what
i
mean
alex
was
rather
glad
that
her
companion
should
be
talking
to
her
so
eagerly
as
they
came
in
sight
of
a
group
of
people
on
the
terrace
here
are
the
truants
said
cardew
laughing
and
diana
munroe
exclaimed
that
aunt
esther
had
called
them
all
to
tea
and
they
had
given
up
further
hunt
for
them
noel
always
finds
extraordinary
places
to
hide
in
she
added
rather
disparagingly
it
was
evident
that
noel
was
not
very
popular
with
the
american
cousins
that
boy
would
be
very
good
looking
if
he
had
not
that
terrible
cast
alex
overheard
one
lady
say
to
another
as
the
visitors
were
waiting
on
the
steps
for
the
to
take
them
away
the
man
next
to
whom
alex
had
sat
at
lunch
and
who
evidently
did
not
know
any
of
the
group
of
children
apart
nodded
in
the
direction
of
little
archie
flushed
and
excited
trying
to
climb
the
terrace
wall
surrounded
by
adoring
ladies
that
the
little
chap
for
my
money
is
he
a
darling
that
one
of
isabel
clare
children
so
are
the
two
girls
in
blue
i
could
believe
anything
so
tall
was
really
hers
oh
yes
i
noticed
one
of
them
rather
like
her
mother
alex
felt
sure
that
she
ought
not
to
listen
and
at
the
same
time
kept
motionless
lest
they
should
notice
her
and
lower
their
voices
she
felt
eagerly
anxious
to
overhear
what
the
gentleman
might
have
to
say
after
the
very
way
in
which
she
had
made
conversation
with
him
at
lunch
and
having
been
a
very
pretty
and
child
in
her
nursery
days
could
not
altogether
divest
herself
of
the
expectation
that
she
must
still
be
found
pretty
and
entertaining
but
the
gentleman
said
impartially
they
are
neither
of
them
a
patch
on
lady
isabel
are
they
they
are
at
the
awkward
age
laughed
the
lady
to
whom
he
was
talking
one
of
them
sat
next
to
you
at
lunch
did
she
yes
not
quite
so
natural
as
the
other
children
that
little
american
girl
now
a
regular
child
alex
with
a
face
grown
suddenly
scarlet
left
barbara
shyly
and
cedric
briefly
to
thank
their
hostess
for
the
pleasant
day
they
had
spent
a
new
and
far
more
painful
than
any
she
had
yet
known
hampered
her
tongue
and
her
movements
until
they
were
safely
in
the
down
the
drive
they
are
nice
are
they
said
barbara
i
sure
they
are
nicer
than
queenie
no
they
are
alex
contradicted
mechanically
well
marie
and
diana
are
anyway
she
looked
slyly
at
cedric
you
think
so
cedric
how
can
i
tell
whether
they
are
any
nicer
as
you
call
it
than
another
kid
whom
i
never
seen
inquired
cedric
reasonably
but
did
you
like
marie
she
all
right
barbara
giggled
in
the
way
most
disliked
by
her
family
the
authorities
of
whom
stigmatized
the
habit
as
vulgar
and
cedric
said
severely
i
should
think
decent
girls
would
want
to
play
with
you
at
all
if
you
do
leave
off
that
idiotic
trick
of
cackling
but
barbara
who
was
not
at
all
easily
crushed
continued
to
giggle
silently
at
intervals
why
are
you
so
silly
alex
asked
her
crossly
as
they
were
going
to
bed
that
night
she
and
barbara
shared
a
room
at
fiveapples
farm
barbara
whined
the
inevitable
contradiction
i
not
silly
but
added
immediately
you
would
be
so
cross
if
you
knew
what
i
know
i
expect
you
laugh
too
well
what
is
it
i
sha
tell
you
alex
was
not
particularly
curious
but
she
had
been
the
nursery
autocrat
too
long
to
be
able
to
endure
resistance
to
her
command
tell
me
at
once
barbara
no
i
wo
yes
you
will
well
what
is
it
about
said
alex
changing
her
tactics
it
about
cedric
is
he
in
a
scrape
no
it
just
something
he
did
did
he
tell
you
about
it
oh
no
he
does
know
i
know
he
be
furious
if
he
did
i
expect
who
told
you
does
any
one
else
know
nobody
told
me
one
other
person
knows
giggled
barbara
jumping
up
and
down
in
her
petticoat
keep
still
you
have
the
candle
over
who
the
other
person
who
knows
guess
oh
i
ca
do
be
so
silly
i
am
not
going
to
ask
you
any
more
well
said
barbara
in
a
great
hurry
it
marie
munroe
then
about
her
what
about
her
she
did
take
any
notice
of
any
one
except
cedric
and
i
think
it
was
very
rude
and
stupid
of
her
it
was
cedric
doing
much
more
than
hers
barbara
said
shrewdly
i
think
he
thinks
he
is
in
love
with
her
i
saw
them
in
the
shrubbery
when
we
were
playing
and
what
do
you
think
alex
well
what
cedric
kissed
her
i
saw
him
then
said
alex
it
was
perfectly
hateful
of
him
and
of
marie
and
of
you
why
of
shrieked
barbara
in
a
high
key
of
indignation
what
have
i
done
i
should
like
to
know
you
no
business
to
say
anything
about
it
put
out
the
candle
barbara
i
going
to
get
into
bed
in
the
darkness
alex
lay
with
her
mind
in
a
tumult
it
seemed
to
her
incredible
that
her
brother
whom
she
had
always
supposed
to
despise
every
form
of
sentimentality
as
he
did
any
display
of
feeling
on
the
part
of
his
family
should
have
wanted
to
kiss
little
marie
whom
he
had
only
known
for
one
day
and
who
was
by
far
the
least
pretty
of
any
of
the
three
munroe
sisters
and
to
kiss
her
in
the
shrubbery
like
that
alex
felt
disgusted
and
indignant
she
thought
about
it
for
a
long
while
before
she
went
to
sleep
although
she
would
gladly
have
dismissed
the
incident
from
her
mind
most
of
all
perhaps
she
was
filled
with
astonishment
why
should
any
one
want
to
kiss
marie
munroe
in
the
depths
of
her
heart
was
another
wonder
which
she
never
formulated
even
to
herself
and
of
which
she
would
for
very
shame
have
strenuously
denied
the
existence
why
had
she
not
the
same
mysterious
attraction
as
little
marie
alex
knew
instinctively
that
it
would
never
have
occurred
say
to
noel
cardew
to
ask
her
if
he
might
kiss
her
she
did
not
want
him
to
would
have
been
shocked
and
indignant
at
the
mere
idea
but
unconsciously
she
wished
that
he
had
wanted
to
vi
the
end
of
an
era
no
salient
landmarks
ever
seemed
to
alex
to
render
eventful
the
two
and
a
half
years
that
elapsed
between
those
summer
holidays
at
fiveapples
farm
and
her
final
departure
from
the
liège
convent
to
begin
her
life
at
home
the
of
the
day
routine
consequent
on
the
beginning
of
the
winter
caused
her
to
miss
queenie
less
acutely
than
she
had
done
when
she
first
came
home
for
the
holidays
and
with
absence
there
were
fewer
revolts
against
convent
law
and
less
disfavour
from
the
authorities
she
made
no
other
great
friends
marie
munroe
showed
her
a
marked
friendliness
at
first
but
alex
could
not
forget
that
giggling
revelation
of
barbara
and
shrank
from
her
advances
unmistakably
she
had
very
little
in
common
with
her
french
contemporaries
and
knew
that
they
thought
her
english
accent
and
absence
of
proficiency
in
needlework
marks
of
eccentricity
and
of
bad
form
so
that
she
became
and
aggressive
before
them
she
was
hardly
aware
of
her
own
intense
loneliness
the
poignant
realization
of
it
was
to
come
later
but
the
want
of
any
channel
of
for
her
emotional
capabilities
produced
in
her
a
species
of
permanent
discontent
that
reacted
on
her
health
and
on
her
spirits
so
that
she
got
the
reputation
least
enviable
of
any
in
schoolgirl
circles
of
being
a
tragedy
queen
her
morose
pallor
partly
the
result
of
an
system
and
partly
of
her
total
lack
of
any
interest
in
her
surroundings
were
considered
fair
game
voyez
alex
elle
a
son
air
bête
a
qui
alex
they
were
quite
and
did
not
mean
to
hurt
her
it
was
not
their
fault
that
such
stabbed
her
and
sent
her
away
to
cry
over
her
own
friendlessness
until
she
felt
sick
and
exhausted
she
did
not
expend
on
any
one
else
the
extravagant
worship
bestowed
upon
queenie
torrance
for
a
year
she
wrote
to
queenie
throughout
the
holidays
and
received
meagre
and
unsatisfactory
replies
and
then
gradually
the
correspondence
ceased
altogether
and
alex
only
looked
forward
with
an
occasional
vague
curiosity
to
the
possibility
of
meeting
queenie
again
in
london
on
the
terms
of
equality
symbolized
by
their
both
being
during
her
last
year
at
school
lack
of
intimate
intercourse
with
any
one
and
the
languid
sentimentality
of
adolescence
made
her
take
for
the
first
time
some
interest
in
religion
as
understood
at
the
convent
she
prolonged
her
weekly
confession
which
had
hitherto
been
a
matter
of
routine
to
be
got
through
as
rapidly
as
possible
in
order
to
obtain
the
solace
of
talking
about
herself
and
derived
a
certain
tepid
pleasure
in
minutely
following
and
applying
to
herself
the
more
anecdotal
portions
of
the
new
testament
for
a
time
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
found
a
refuge
then
came
the
affair
of
the
examination
alex
in
her
last
term
and
taking
part
in
the
final
midsummer
could
not
bear
the
penalty
of
failure
which
it
seemed
to
her
would
be
displayed
in
the
mediocrity
which
had
all
along
been
her
portion
she
had
never
been
admitted
to
the
virtuous
society
of
the
de
had
never
taken
more
than
one
of
the
less
distinguished
prizes
at
the
end
of
any
term
and
had
no
report
to
display
her
popularity
and
the
sense
of
loss
that
her
departure
would
leave
her
place
in
the
examination
was
not
a
good
one
she
had
none
of
cedric
power
of
concentration
and
her
abilities
were
not
such
as
to
win
her
any
regard
in
the
continental
and
catholic
system
of
education
of
the
middle
nineties
she
cheated
over
the
examination
it
was
quite
easy
to
copy
from
the
girl
next
her
who
happened
to
be
one
of
the
best
vehicles
for
and
quite
unconnected
facts
in
the
school
alex
could
read
the
dates
and
the
proper
names
and
all
the
principal
words
on
her
history
paper
and
transferred
them
to
her
own
clothing
the
dry
bones
in
the
imaginative
fabric
of
her
own
words
for
the
english
girls
were
allowed
to
do
most
of
the
papers
in
their
own
language
at
the
end
of
the
morning
she
was
oddly
elated
at
the
sight
of
her
paper
and
felt
no
qualms
at
all
in
the
afternoon
she
was
again
next
to
and
congratulated
herself
that
the
paper
should
be
the
literature
one
arithmetic
she
knew
was
not
the
strong
point
of
and
besides
it
would
be
almost
impossible
to
copy
the
working
of
problems
figure
for
figure
without
ultimate
detection
that
night
however
when
alex
knelt
down
to
say
her
prayers
she
was
suddenly
overwhelmed
by
remorse
and
terror
her
crime
came
between
her
and
god
the
vaguely
comforting
belief
that
because
she
was
lonely
and
miserable
he
would
vouchsafe
to
her
an
especial
pity
was
destroyed
between
god
and
a
sinner
so
alex
had
been
told
lay
an
impassable
gulf
that
only
repentance
confession
atonement
and
punishment
could
bridge
and
even
then
an
indelible
entry
against
one
name
testified
to
eventual
exposure
and
shame
at
some
dreadful
inevitable
assizes
when
sins
hidden
and
forgotten
large
and
small
of
commission
and
omission
alike
would
be
made
known
to
all
the
world
assembled
together
for
the
last
judgment
faced
with
this
inevitable
retribution
alex
felt
that
no
present
success
was
worth
it
and
wondered
whether
she
could
not
repair
her
wickedness
as
far
as
possible
on
the
morrow
by
confession
but
when
the
morrow
had
come
the
day
of
judgment
seemed
far
removed
from
the
hot
july
morning
and
the
when
the
result
of
the
examinations
would
be
heard
a
very
present
reality
indeed
it
was
a
relief
to
the
hot
tossing
sensation
of
balancing
values
in
her
mind
to
remember
that
it
was
the
day
of
the
catechism
examination
which
would
be
viva
voce
she
acquitted
herself
very
badly
and
the
temptation
to
retrieve
her
failure
in
the
afternoon
was
irresistible
when
she
again
found
herself
placed
next
to
the
prodigy
the
paper
was
headed
histoire
de
and
immense
value
was
attached
to
proficiency
in
the
subject
strenuously
taught
to
the
convent
pupils
out
of
enormous
volumes
containing
much
loyal
fiction
with
a
modicum
of
distorted
historical
fact
alex
fell
she
could
overlook
her
neighbour
papers
so
easily
hardly
even
turning
her
head
that
it
only
struck
her
as
inconvenient
and
did
not
awake
in
her
any
fear
of
detection
when
presently
pulled
a
piece
of
towards
her
so
that
it
covered
the
page
on
which
she
was
working
alex
finished
the
question
to
which
had
unwittingly
supplied
her
with
material
for
the
answer
and
looked
about
her
subconsciously
waiting
for
the
removal
of
the
her
eyes
met
those
of
a
younger
child
seated
exactly
opposite
to
her
whose
sharp
dark
gaze
was
fixed
upon
her
with
a
sort
of
eager
contemptuous
horror
in
that
instant
when
it
seemed
as
though
her
heart
had
stopped
beating
alex
knew
herself
detected
the
colour
rushed
from
her
face
and
she
felt
cold
and
giddy
lacking
the
instinctive
guard
against
which
is
the
of
the
habitual
deceiver
her
terrified
gaze
turned
straight
to
the
smooth
dark
head
was
bent
low
one
hand
still
clutched
at
the
covering
and
the
ear
and
piece
of
cheek
which
were
all
that
alex
could
see
were
scarlet
knew
the
child
opposite
had
seen
alex
cheat
and
had
no
doubt
conveyed
a
silent
telegraphic
warning
it
seemed
to
alex
that
the
world
had
stopped
accusation
disgrace
expulsion
all
whirled
through
her
mind
and
left
no
permanent
image
there
her
imagination
stopped
utterly
dead
at
the
horror
of
it
she
sat
perfectly
motionless
for
the
remaining
hours
of
the
morning
unconscious
of
the
passage
of
time
only
conscious
of
an
increasing
sense
of
physical
sickness
it
was
an
absolute
relief
to
her
when
the
bell
rang
and
she
found
herself
obliged
to
get
up
and
move
across
the
long
with
the
others
to
give
up
her
papers
vous
êtes
malade
alexandra
said
alex
faintly
she
was
sent
to
the
infirmary
to
lie
down
and
the
old
in
charge
of
it
was
so
kind
to
her
and
commiserated
her
wan
forlorn
appearance
so
pityingly
that
alex
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
that
relieved
the
tension
of
her
body
and
sent
her
quivering
but
uncomprehendingly
sensible
of
relief
to
rest
exhaustedly
upon
the
narrow
infirmary
bed
with
little
white
curtains
drawn
all
round
it
no
doubt
every
one
would
soon
know
of
her
disgrace
and
she
would
be
expelled
to
the
shame
and
anger
of
her
father
and
mother
and
the
downfall
of
all
her
boastings
to
barbara
no
doubt
god
had
abandoned
one
so
unworthy
of
his
forgiveness
but
soeur
clementine
was
kind
and
it
seemed
in
the
incredible
comfort
of
a
little
human
tenderness
that
nothing
else
mattered
and
after
all
that
hour
anticipation
proved
to
be
the
worst
that
happened
to
her
she
went
downstairs
for
the
evening
preparation
and
a
trusted
de
obtained
permission
to
speak
to
her
alone
and
solemnly
conducted
her
to
the
lavatory
as
the
most
private
place
in
the
school
standing
over
the
sink
with
its
stiff
and
solitary
tap
of
cold
water
conducted
her
inquiry
with
passionless
directness
alex
made
no
attempt
either
to
deny
her
sin
or
to
palliate
it
she
was
mentally
and
emotionally
far
too
much
exhausted
for
any
effort
and
it
did
not
even
occur
to
her
that
any
excuse
could
avail
her
anything
was
not
at
all
unkind
she
knew
all
about
and
was
agreeably
conscious
of
exercising
this
reputable
virtue
to
the
full
when
she
informed
alex
that
no
one
should
ever
know
of
the
lapse
from
her
provided
that
alex
making
her
own
explanation
to
the
should
withdraw
her
papers
from
the
examination
but
what
can
i
say
to
her
asked
alex
quant
à
ça
said
in
the
detached
tones
of
one
who
had
accomplished
her
duty
and
felt
no
further
interest
on
the
point
at
issue
quant
à
ça
avec
vôtre
conscience
to
this
task
she
left
alex
and
alex
ended
by
doing
nothing
at
all
partly
from
inertia
partly
because
she
knew
that
would
never
ask
her
what
she
had
done
she
shirked
the
shame
and
trouble
of
confession
to
her
and
let
her
papers
go
in
with
the
others
she
knew
that
she
would
not
get
a
high
place
for
her
work
all
through
the
term
had
been
bad
and
would
have
to
be
taken
into
consideration
and
over
all
the
remaining
papers
she
muddled
hopelessly
besides
she
was
leaving
for
good
and
no
one
would
know
she
had
lost
her
when
she
first
realized
that
she
was
cheating
and
it
was
then
as
she
neared
the
completion
of
her
seventeenth
year
that
the
belief
was
ineradicably
planted
in
alex
soul
that
she
had
been
born
with
a
natural
love
of
evil
and
that
goodness
was
an
abstract
attitude
of
mind
to
which
she
could
never
do
more
than
aspire
fruitlessly
with
no
slightest
expectation
of
attainment
she
was
further
conscious
of
an
intense
determination
to
hide
the
knowledge
of
her
own
innate
badness
from
every
one
if
she
were
ever
seen
in
her
true
colours
no
one
would
love
her
and
alex
already
knew
dimly
and
with
a
further
sense
of
having
strange
low
standards
of
her
own
that
she
wanted
to
be
loved
more
than
anything
in
the
world
far
more
than
she
wanted
to
be
good
the
affair
of
the
examination
passed
and
although
alex
did
not
forget
it
she
mostly
remembered
it
as
merely
the
culminating
scandal
of
a
succession
of
petty
evasions
and
cowardly
deceptions
she
left
liège
without
regret
she
had
hated
the
physical
discomfort
of
the
conventual
system
the
insufficient
hours
of
sleep
the
bitter
cold
of
the
belgian
winters
and
the
streaming
rain
that
defiled
the
summers
she
had
hated
the
endless
restrictions
and
the
minute
system
of
that
was
never
relaxed
above
all
she
had
hated
the
sense
of
her
own
isolation
in
a
crowd
her
own
utter
absence
of
attraction
for
her
kind
it
seemed
to
alex
that
when
she
joined
the
mysterious
ranks
of
everything
would
be
different
she
never
doubted
that
with
long
dresses
and
hair
her
whole
personality
would
change
and
the
meaningless
chaos
of
life
reduce
itself
to
some
comprehensible
solution
everything
all
her
life
had
been
tending
towards
the
business
of
growing
up
everything
that
she
was
taught
at
home
impressed
the
theory
that
her
coming
out
would
usher
in
the
realities
of
life
and
nothing
impressed
her
more
with
a
sense
of
the
tremendous
importance
of
the
approaching
change
than
lady
isabel
greeting
when
she
came
back
to
clevedon
square
after
her
final
term
at
liège
we
put
off
scotland
for
a
week
darling
your
father
been
so
good
about
it
so
that
i
may
see
about
your
clothes
i
made
appointments
with
marguerite
and
the
other
places
for
you
so
there
be
nothin
to
do
but
try
on
but
of
course
i
shall
have
to
see
the
things
myself
before
they
finish
them
and
tell
them
about
the
colours
they
sure
to
want
to
touch
everything
up
with
pink
or
blue
and
white
is
so
much
prettier
for
a
young
girl
white
with
a
tiny
little
edging
i
thought
for
one
of
your
evenin
dresses
the
first
thing
of
course
is
your
hair
louise
must
go
with
you
to
hugo
and
watch
them
very
carefully
while
they
do
it
in
two
or
three
different
styles
then
she
be
able
to
do
it
for
you
every
evening
i
expect
she
have
to
do
it
every
day
to
begin
with
but
you
must
try
and
learn
i
should
like
you
to
be
to
be
independent
of
a
maid
in
that
sort
of
way
one
never
knows
quite
that
some
time
one
might
find
oneself
stranded
for
a
day
or
two
i
do
think
your
hair
will
need
waving
alex
which
is
such
a
comfort
so
many
women
have
to
wear
their
fringe
in
curlers
every
night
thank
heaven
i
never
had
to
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
say
fringes
are
goin
out
now
but
i
certainly
not
goin
to
let
yours
grow
until
we
quite
certain
about
it
and
a
bald
forehead
is
always
so
unbecomin
alex
listened
with
a
sense
of
importance
and
excitement
but
she
was
also
rather
bewildered
the
contrast
between
all
this
preoccupation
with
her
clothes
and
her
appearance
and
the
austere
mental
striving
after
spiritual
or
moral
results
which
had
permeated
the
convent
atmosphere
was
too
violent
you
be
interested
in
it
all
my
darling
wo
you
asked
lady
isabel
disappointedly
i
could
bear
to
have
a
daughter
who
care
about
her
things
some
girls
are
like
that
so
disappointin
after
one
had
all
the
trouble
of
their
upbringin
and
is
lookin
forward
to
a
little
reward
alex
could
find
no
words
in
which
to
explain
what
she
knew
quite
well
that
she
was
as
full
of
eager
anticipations
as
lady
isabel
could
wish
but
was
too
much
bewildered
by
the
novelty
of
it
all
as
yet
to
give
any
expression
to
them
she
became
rather
boisterous
and
unconvincing
in
her
endeavours
to
express
by
means
which
were
not
spontaneous
the
pleasure
and
excitement
expected
of
her
you
learn
to
move
prettily
and
quietly
darling
and
we
must
see
about
some
dancin
lessons
before
next
year
dancin
fashions
alter
so
quickly
said
lady
isabel
her
low
gentle
tones
a
shade
lower
and
more
gentle
than
usual
but
i
sha
go
to
balls
yet
stammered
alex
she
and
barbara
had
only
been
allowed
a
very
few
children
parties
and
for
the
last
few
years
she
had
been
considered
too
old
for
these
she
thought
of
a
ball
as
a
prolonged
glorified
party
not
until
after
your
presentation
of
course
and
that
wo
be
till
the
spring
but
there
may
be
one
or
two
affairs
in
the
country
at
christmas
if
i
take
you
to
stay
about
as
i
hope
you
see
darling
my
plan
is
to
let
you
have
the
next
two
months
in
the
country
with
little
barbara
just
as
usual
only
you
must
take
great
care
not
to
let
yourself
get
freckled
in
the
sun
and
then
when
you
come
back
to
town
in
october
you
can
have
your
hair
properly
put
up
and
come
about
with
me
so
as
to
get
to
know
people
and
make
a
little
beginnin
before
there
any
question
of
really
doing
the
season
properly
next
summer
alex
began
to
feel
vastly
important
she
had
never
been
the
centre
of
so
much
attention
before
evidently
this
affair
of
coming
out
was
the
culminating
point
to
which
all
life
had
hitherto
been
tending
even
barbara
treated
her
with
a
rather
envious
respect
now
only
cedric
remained
unimpressed
and
treated
his
eldest
sister
marked
tendency
to
assume
airs
of
extreme
maturity
with
silent
indifference
his
school
career
was
proceeding
more
triumphantly
than
ever
and
his
removes
succeeded
one
another
with
a
rapidity
only
less
startling
than
his
increasing
reputation
as
a
cricketer
he
spent
most
of
his
holidays
with
a
schoolfellow
and
showed
himself
rather
scornful
of
girls
in
general
and
of
his
sisters
in
particular
although
he
played
willingly
enough
with
little
pamela
who
had
grown
to
an
attractive
and
talkative
age
barbara
asked
him
once
with
the
touch
of
slyness
characteristic
of
her
in
certain
moods
whether
he
remembered
marie
munroe
american
kid
oh
yes
said
cedric
loftily
did
she
have
a
sister
who
was
bosom
friends
with
alex
at
liège
or
some
rot
of
that
kind
and
alex
had
felt
unaccountably
relieved
at
the
implication
of
the
evanescent
character
of
cedric
whilom
admiration
they
spent
august
and
september
at
the
seaside
on
the
cornish
coast
alex
enjoyed
the
daily
bathing
and
scrambling
over
the
rocks
barefooted
and
the
picnic
teas
in
any
sheltered
cove
that
old
nurse
judged
sufficiently
protected
from
the
profane
gaze
of
possible
trippers
but
she
had
all
the
time
the
sense
that
these
hot
leisurely
days
were
only
a
time
of
waiting
and
even
when
she
enjoyed
herself
most
she
was
conscious
of
a
gnawing
impatience
for
the
next
step
the
week
in
london
before
lady
isabel
and
sir
francis
started
for
scotland
had
rather
disappointed
alex
although
she
did
not
own
it
even
to
herself
perpetual
tryings
on
in
hot
weather
had
proved
a
tiring
performance
and
her
feet
ached
from
standing
and
from
the
hot
pavement
so
that
she
dragged
herself
rather
than
walked
or
stood
on
one
foot
so
as
to
save
the
other
which
had
vexed
lady
isabel
and
led
to
a
long
admonition
as
to
the
importance
of
moving
properly
and
always
holding
oneself
upright
moreover
alex
although
she
did
not
give
very
much
thought
to
her
own
looks
as
a
rule
had
always
expected
that
as
soon
as
she
grew
up
she
would
almost
automatically
become
very
beautiful
and
it
vexed
and
surprised
her
to
find
that
her
new
frocks
still
in
a
very
incompleted
stage
did
not
at
once
produce
any
startling
change
in
her
appearance
it
was
also
disappointing
that
her
mother
and
her
mother
dressmaker
should
so
often
seem
to
find
in
her
hitherto
unsuspected
deficiencies
wo
be
able
to
wear
just
at
present
móddam
i
afraid
at
least
not
until
we
got
rid
of
that
redness
dear
me
no
i
suppose
that
comes
from
keepin
her
elbows
on
a
school
desk
how
very
vexin
really
the
nuns
must
have
been
very
careless
to
let
you
get
into
the
way
of
it
alex
and
it
made
your
shoulders
round
too
keep
her
shoulders
well
back
if
that
white
chiffon
is
to
look
like
anything
at
all
chimed
in
madame
marguerite
most
impressively
it
will
simply
be
ruination
to
let
it
drop
like
that
in
the
front
takes
away
all
the
smartness
from
it
alex
straightened
herself
uneasily
it
such
a
simple
little
frock
the
whole
thing
is
how
it
worn
which
made
alex
feel
miserably
unequal
to
the
responsibility
laid
upon
her
her
neck
is
very
thin
sighed
lady
isabel
and
madame
marguerite
her
large
head
with
its
weight
of
elaborate
yellow
waves
well
on
one
side
as
she
gazed
at
alex
had
looked
very
disparaging
indeed
as
she
said
in
tones
more
consolatory
than
hopeful
of
course
may
fill
out
a
bit
before
next
year
alex
in
her
heart
had
been
thankful
when
it
was
all
over
and
she
had
gone
back
to
the
old
blue
cotton
frocks
that
were
to
be
worn
out
at
the
seaside
her
only
responsibility
there
was
the
daily
struggle
of
putting
up
her
hair
to
her
disgust
and
to
barbara
derision
the
had
insisted
upon
a
large
frame
which
made
her
head
ache
and
pinned
on
by
her
unskilful
hands
displayed
a
strong
tendency
to
slip
down
the
back
of
her
neck
and
however
much
she
might
brush
and
pull
her
hair
over
it
there
always
appeared
a
hiatus
sooner
or
later
through
which
a
large
patch
of
what
barbara
jeeringly
called
false
horsehair
might
plainly
be
seen
in
spite
of
it
all
however
alex
enjoyed
those
last
schoolroom
days
of
hers
more
than
any
she
had
yet
known
real
life
was
going
to
begin
and
though
alex
had
no
idea
as
to
how
the
transformation
would
be
effected
she
was
convinced
that
everything
which
she
had
longed
for
and
utterly
missed
throughout
her
schooldays
would
now
be
hers
vii
london
season
alex
first
london
season
from
the
very
extravagance
of
her
expectations
was
a
disappointment
to
her
her
own
appearance
indeed
in
her
first
surprised
and
delighted
her
and
she
stood
before
the
great
pier
glass
in
the
under
the
chandelier
which
had
been
specially
lit
for
the
occasion
and
gazed
at
her
reflection
with
incredulous
admiration
her
dress
in
the
height
of
the
prevailing
fashion
had
been
the
subject
of
lady
isabel
minute
and
careful
consultations
with
madame
marguerite
of
new
bond
street
of
stiff
white
satin
the
neck
was
cut
into
a
hard
square
and
the
bodice
as
it
was
still
called
unsoftened
except
for
a
small
draping
of
pleated
white
chiffon
held
on
the
left
shoulder
with
a
cluster
of
roses
which
were
repeated
at
the
side
of
the
broad
belt
the
most
prominent
feature
of
the
dress
was
the
immensity
of
the
sleeves
stiffened
within
by
strips
of
petersham
and
standing
well
up
from
the
shoulders
thence
the
monstrous
things
narrowed
imperceptibly
and
were
gathered
in
just
below
the
elbow
leaving
no
hiatus
visible
between
them
and
the
gloves
the
skirt
had
no
train
but
fell
into
plain
heavy
folds
sweeping
the
ground
and
with
a
slight
additional
length
of
tail
and
a
considerable
additional
fulness
behind
a
white
fan
hung
by
white
satin
ribbon
from
her
waist
it
looks
charming
said
lady
isabel
delightedly
better
than
your
presentation
frock
the
servants
who
had
respectfully
petitioned
through
lady
isabel
maid
to
be
allowed
to
see
miss
clare
in
her
before
she
started
were
grouped
in
the
doorway
the
long
white
streamers
of
the
maids
caps
contrasting
sharply
with
their
neat
black
dresses
old
nurse
a
privileged
personage
was
right
inside
the
inspecting
critically
i
never
thought
you
look
so
well
miss
alex
she
observed
candidly
they
hid
your
failings
something
wonderful
and
your
hair
and
complexion
was
always
good
thanks
to
the
care
i
took
of
them
that
i
will
say
do
those
shoes
pinch
alex
asked
barbara
looking
on
enviously
in
her
plain
schoolroom
frock
and
strapped
shoes
with
her
hair
still
hanging
down
her
back
alex
did
not
care
whether
her
pointed
white
satin
shoes
pinched
her
feet
or
not
she
was
too
happy
in
her
first
triumph
it
was
not
quite
a
solitary
triumph
for
sir
francis
after
a
prolonged
gazing
through
his
double
that
made
her
flush
more
than
ever
from
nervousness
gave
one
of
his
rare
smiles
of
gratification
and
said
very
pretty
indeed
i
congratulate
you
on
your
appearance
my
dear
child
but
it
was
to
lady
isabel
that
he
turned
next
moment
with
that
sudden
softened
glance
that
he
never
bestowed
elsewhere
how
beautifully
you
dressed
her
my
dear
you
will
be
taken
for
sisters
now
that
she
is
in
long
dresses
the
compliment
was
not
and
alex
watching
her
exquisite
flush
felt
a
vague
dissatisfaction
with
her
own
immaturity
she
might
be
pretty
with
youthful
colouring
and
smooth
skin
but
she
lacked
the
poise
that
added
charm
to
her
mother
beauty
and
a
struggling
consciousness
of
that
lack
disturbed
and
vexed
her
i
think
she
better
without
any
ornament
do
you
francis
asked
her
mother
critically
some
girls
wear
pearls
i
know
but
i
never
quite
like
it
not
the
first
year
anyway
her
opera
cloak
over
her
shoulders
its
outline
and
heavy
collar
of
adding
to
the
already
disproportionate
width
of
the
upper
part
of
her
person
alex
followed
lady
isabel
into
the
carriage
she
wore
nothing
over
her
head
for
fear
of
disarranging
the
light
fringe
curling
on
her
forehead
that
first
ball
remained
in
her
mind
as
a
medley
of
valse
tunes
quadrilles
and
jigging
polkas
blazing
lights
and
red
and
white
flowers
everywhere
and
a
sequence
of
strange
young
men
brought
up
in
rapid
succession
by
the
daughters
of
her
hostess
and
introduced
in
an
unvarying
formula
to
which
each
responded
by
a
bow
and
a
polite
request
for
the
pleasure
of
a
dance
with
her
alex
danced
readily
enough
but
found
conversation
strangely
difficult
expecting
she
knew
not
what
profundities
of
intercourse
which
were
never
forthcoming
her
chief
gratification
was
that
of
seeing
lady
isabel
pretty
pleased
smile
at
the
sight
of
her
daughter
dancing
are
you
enjoying
yourself
darling
she
asked
several
times
as
alex
returned
between
each
dance
to
the
row
of
gilt
chairs
against
the
wall
alex
said
yes
sincerely
enough
but
she
was
all
the
time
reminded
of
that
strange
disconcerting
experience
that
had
been
hers
a
year
or
two
earlier
when
she
had
sought
to
persuade
herself
of
a
great
success
with
the
boy
noel
cardew
she
boasted
of
her
enjoyment
of
the
ball
to
barbara
next
day
and
said
that
she
had
been
so
busy
dancing
that
she
had
never
gone
down
to
supper
at
all
but
that
must
never
happen
again
lady
isabel
said
horrified
girls
do
that
sort
of
thing
at
first
when
they
foolish
and
then
they
get
and
lose
all
their
looks
and
have
no
more
good
times
it
seemed
the
omega
of
disaster
nevertheless
there
were
other
balls
when
alex
did
not
go
down
to
supper
sometimes
because
no
one
had
asked
her
to
do
so
she
nearly
always
had
partners
for
she
danced
reasonably
though
not
superlatively
well
and
introductions
were
still
the
fashion
but
the
number
of
her
partners
depended
very
largely
upon
the
attentiveness
of
her
hostess
or
of
her
hostess
daughters
young
men
did
not
always
claim
dances
from
her
although
they
had
been
amongst
her
partners
at
the
ball
of
the
week
before
nor
did
many
of
them
ask
for
two
or
three
dances
in
one
evening
lady
isabel
had
said
never
more
than
three
dances
with
the
same
man
alex
at
the
very
it
such
bad
form
to
make
yourself
conspicuous
with
any
one
your
father
would
dislike
it
very
much
alex
bore
the
warning
carefully
in
mind
and
was
naïvely
surprised
that
no
occasion
for
making
practical
application
of
it
should
occur
she
was
intensely
anxious
to
be
liked
and
admired
and
she
strangely
confounded
the
two
issues
in
her
own
mind
attributes
such
as
her
clear
skin
her
hair
or
her
expensive
frocks
she
thought
would
promote
interest
in
her
amongst
her
and
to
the
same
end
she
simulated
an
enthusiasm
which
was
so
entirely
foreign
to
her
real
feelings
that
it
lacked
any
semblance
of
body
for
the
crazes
of
her
immediate
generation
centred
in
planchette
and
in
the
publication
of
she
was
full
of
preconceived
ideas
as
to
that
which
constituted
attractiveness
and
in
her
very
ardour
to
realize
the
conventional
ideal
of
the
day
failed
entirely
to
attract
in
intercourse
with
other
girls
still
in
their
first
or
second
season
she
slowly
began
to
suspect
the
deficiencies
in
herself
i
engaged
for
nearly
every
single
valse
at
the
duchess
ball
on
tuesday
already
a
very
young
little
creature
exclaimed
in
alex
hearing
alex
was
astounded
what
could
the
little
thing
mean
nearly
all
my
last
night
partners
will
be
there
and
they
all
asked
me
for
dances
and
some
for
two
or
three
said
the
child
with
ingenuous
pride
alex
was
frankly
amazed
lady
mollie
was
not
particularly
pretty
and
her
conversation
was
the
veriest
stream
of
prattle
yet
she
was
asked
to
reserve
the
favour
of
her
dances
three
days
or
four
days
in
advance
and
the
experience
was
evidently
no
new
one
to
her
although
she
had
only
come
out
a
few
weeks
earlier
than
alex
it
was
the
same
little
lady
mollie
who
gave
alex
a
further
shock
by
demanding
of
her
very
seriously
do
you
know
a
girl
called
miss
torrance
a
girl
with
very
fair
hair
she
says
she
was
at
school
with
you
queenie
torrance
oh
said
alex
the
old
fervour
rushing
to
her
voice
at
the
sudden
memory
of
queenie
who
had
left
her
letters
unanswered
of
whom
she
had
heard
nothing
for
two
years
she
tremendously
admired
by
people
said
lady
mollie
shaking
her
head
with
a
quaint
air
of
sapience
i
know
two
or
three
who
rave
about
her
mother
says
she
rather
inclined
to
be
fast
i
think
people
do
like
her
father
very
much
and
he
generally
takes
her
about
you
do
know
them
very
well
do
you
alex
hastily
disclaimed
any
intimacy
with
queenie
unpopular
parent
she
felt
disloyal
to
queenie
for
the
eagerness
with
which
she
did
so
two
nights
later
at
one
of
the
big
evening
receptions
that
alex
enjoyed
least
of
any
form
of
entertainment
miss
torrance
name
was
again
mentioned
to
her
she
was
listening
to
the
conversation
of
a
young
german
jew
whose
name
of
goldstein
already
spoken
with
bated
breath
in
financial
circles
conveyed
less
to
her
inexperience
than
did
the
dark
glowing
eyes
swarthy
skin
and
the
semitic
curve
of
his
handsome
nose
his
voice
was
very
slightly
guttural
and
he
slurred
his
r
all
but
imperceptibly
as
he
spoke
she
found
that
conversation
with
him
was
exceedingly
easy
and
translated
the
faint
hint
of
servility
in
his
deference
as
did
most
women
not
of
his
own
race
into
sympathy
with
her
utterances
you
think
so
you
really
think
so
he
inquired
gently
when
she
expressed
a
admiration
for
the
prettiness
of
some
girl
whose
entry
preceded
by
that
of
an
insignificant
couple
had
made
a
slight
stir
round
the
huge
open
doorway
of
the
yes
said
alex
emboldened
by
the
interested
look
in
the
dark
eyes
which
he
kept
upon
her
face
as
though
finding
it
more
worth
while
to
gaze
upon
her
than
upon
the
entering
beauty
i
have
seen
more
beautiful
faces
than
hers
nevertheless
he
responded
the
eloquence
of
his
look
made
alex
feel
as
though
she
had
received
a
compliment
and
she
blushed
as
though
to
cover
her
shyness
the
young
jew
went
on
speaking
i
wonder
if
you
know
miss
torrance
miss
queenie
torrance
she
noticed
that
his
throaty
voice
lingered
over
the
syllables
a
little
she
was
my
great
friend
at
school
indeed
what
a
delightful
friendship
for
both
if
i
may
say
so
i
think
i
may
say
that
i
also
have
the
privilege
of
counting
myself
amongst
the
friends
of
miss
torrance
i
have
seen
her
since
she
left
school
said
alex
wistfully
i
should
like
to
see
her
you
spoke
of
beauty
just
now
said
the
young
jew
deliberately
to
my
mind
miss
torrance
was
the
beauty
of
the
season
when
she
came
out
last
year
she
felt
faintly
surprised
but
spoke
hastily
lest
he
should
think
her
jealous
although
he
had
carefully
emphasized
the
date
of
appearance
into
society
i
heard
only
the
other
day
how
much
she
was
admired
goldstein
dark
face
grew
darker
she
is
very
much
admired
indeed
he
said
emphatically
perhaps
she
will
be
here
tonight
alex
suggested
thinking
that
she
would
like
to
see
queenie
she
is
not
coming
tonight
said
goldstein
with
calm
assurance
are
you
going
to
the
duchess
ball
on
tuesday
but
i
need
not
ask
alex
felt
unreasonably
flattered
at
the
homage
implied
rather
than
expressed
in
the
tone
and
replied
in
the
affirmative
then
you
will
see
miss
torrance
oh
i
glad
said
alex
she
felt
rather
elated
at
the
success
which
her
friend
must
have
undoubtedly
met
with
to
be
so
much
admired
and
she
remembered
with
added
resentment
lady
isabel
old
inquiry
torrance
torrance
who
is
torrance
did
you
know
that
the
girl
i
was
at
liège
with
queenie
torrance
came
out
last
year
and
every
one
says
she
lovely
she
demanded
of
her
mother
i
forgotten
you
were
at
school
with
her
i
remember
now
said
lady
isabel
thoughtfully
who
says
she
is
lovely
oh
lady
mollie
and
every
one
that
goldstein
i
was
talking
to
goldstein
exclaimed
her
mother
with
infinite
contempt
she
was
silent
for
a
little
while
and
then
said
i
heard
about
the
torrance
girl
men
of
a
sort
admire
her
very
much
indeed
but
i
should
be
sorry
if
you
copied
her
style
alex
alex
felt
more
curious
than
ever
blindly
though
she
had
adored
queenie
it
had
not
occurred
to
her
that
she
would
be
considered
very
pretty
and
she
wondered
greatly
concerning
the
development
of
her
old
playmate
when
she
did
see
queenie
at
the
duchess
ball
as
goldstein
had
predicted
lady
isabel
was
not
with
her
excess
of
fatigue
had
unwillingly
constrained
her
to
stay
at
home
while
sir
francis
bored
but
courteous
escorted
his
eldest
daughter
in
her
stead
they
arrived
late
and
stood
for
a
few
minutes
in
the
doorway
watching
the
kaleidoscopic
scene
of
colour
and
movement
in
the
great
illuminated
ballroom
alex
attention
was
attracted
by
a
group
of
men
all
gathered
near
the
door
and
prominent
among
them
goldstein
his
eager
searching
gaze
fixed
upon
the
broad
stairway
without
up
and
down
which
innumerable
figures
passed
and
from
the
sudden
lightning
flash
in
his
ardent
black
gaze
not
less
than
from
a
sort
of
movement
instantly
communicated
to
the
whole
group
alex
guessed
that
he
had
focussed
the
object
of
his
quest
the
announcement
made
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
was
inaudible
amid
the
crashing
of
dance
music
but
alex
recognized
the
entering
couple
in
a
flash
colonel
torrance
with
black
moustache
and
eyebrows
upright
and
soldierly
still
had
changed
less
than
queenie
she
looked
much
taller
than
alex
had
imagined
her
and
her
graceful
outline
was
fuller
but
she
moved
exquisitely
her
very
fair
hair
at
a
time
when
every
woman
wore
a
curled
fringe
was
combed
straight
back
from
her
rounded
brow
leaving
only
the
merest
escaping
curls
at
either
temple
and
gathered
into
the
knot
on
the
top
of
her
head
she
wore
a
wreath
of
tiny
blue
that
deepened
the
tint
of
her
eyes
and
the
colour
was
repeated
freely
in
the
deep
frills
and
ruchings
of
her
white
dress
of
an
elaboration
that
alex
instinctively
knew
her
mother
would
not
have
countenanced
turquoises
were
twisted
round
the
white
full
column
of
her
throat
and
clasped
her
rounded
arms
alex
watched
her
eagerly
every
man
in
the
little
waiting
group
was
pressing
round
her
claiming
first
possession
of
her
attention
the
faint
remotely
smiling
sweetness
of
queenie
mouth
recalled
to
alex
with
extraordinary
vividness
the
schoolgirl
at
the
liège
convent
goldstein
his
eyes
flaming
stood
demonstratively
waiting
with
insolent
security
in
his
bearing
while
she
dispensed
her
favours
right
and
left
always
with
the
same
chilly
composed
sweetness
the
music
which
had
ceased
broke
into
the
lilt
of
the
and
on
the
instant
goldstein
imperiously
approached
queenie
she
swayed
towards
him
still
smiling
slightly
and
they
drifted
into
the
throng
of
dancers
alex
turned
round
with
a
sort
of
gasp
what
must
it
feel
like
to
be
the
heroine
of
a
ballroom
triumph
to
know
that
a
dozen
men
would
count
the
evening
worth
while
for
the
privilege
of
dancing
once
with
her
that
they
would
throng
in
the
doorway
to
watch
and
wait
for
her
coming
some
of
them
remained
in
the
doorway
still
watching
her
dance
the
folds
of
her
dress
and
her
great
white
fan
gathered
into
one
hand
her
white
heavy
eyelids
cast
down
under
her
pure
open
forehead
and
goldstein
arm
encircling
her
waist
as
he
guided
her
steps
skilfully
round
the
crowded
room
alex
saw
that
sir
francis
his
double
eyeglass
raised
was
also
watching
the
couple
i
wonder
who
that
remarkably
pretty
woman
is
of
whom
young
goldstein
is
very
obviously
enamoured
alex
felt
oddly
that
sir
francis
supposed
queenie
to
be
of
maturer
years
than
she
in
reality
was
it
queenie
torrance
father
she
was
at
school
with
me
alex
repeated
i
not
seen
her
since
she
grew
up
but
she
only
about
a
year
older
than
i
am
indeed
curiosity
as
to
the
unanimity
of
masculine
judgment
made
alex
appeal
to
him
with
a
question
do
you
think
she
pretty
father
exceedingly
striking
beautiful
in
fact
said
sir
francis
queenie
was
not
beautiful
and
alex
knew
it
but
the
glamour
of
her
magnetic
personality
was
evidently
as
potent
with
older
men
as
with
young
goldstein
and
his
contemporaries
alex
felt
a
curious
pang
half
of
envy
and
half
of
wonder
sir
francis
put
down
his
glasses
a
pity
he
said
deliberately
that
she
is
not
altogether
and
raised
his
grizzled
eyebrows
viii
goldstein
and
queenie
queenie
torrance
spoke
to
alex
that
night
with
characteristic
suavity
and
showed
pleasure
at
meeting
her
again
those
old
convent
days
seem
a
long
way
off
do
they
she
asked
smiling
a
little
her
glance
sweeping
the
big
ballroom
seemed
to
appraise
its
glories
and
claim
them
for
her
own
it
was
the
glance
rather
than
the
words
to
which
alex
replied
you
having
a
splendid
time
are
you
queenie
you
like
being
i
adore
it
said
miss
torrance
her
eyes
gleaming
like
stars
alex
did
not
wonder
at
it
night
after
night
she
watched
queenie
torrance
accepting
as
her
right
the
homage
of
innumerable
men
halving
the
favour
of
her
dances
at
crowded
balls
where
were
too
numerous
to
be
rescued
from
oblivion
by
the
most
determined
of
hostesses
going
down
to
supper
on
the
arm
of
young
goldstein
and
lingering
with
him
in
prolonged
goldstein
at
the
little
round
table
across
which
he
leant
recklessly
oblivious
of
comment
endeavouring
often
fruitlessly
throughout
a
whole
evening
to
obtain
one
direct
look
from
those
downcast
eyes
under
their
flaxen
lashes
it
was
not
easy
alex
found
to
talk
to
queenie
they
often
met
at
entertainments
and
once
or
twice
in
the
park
but
queenie
never
rode
in
the
mornings
as
alex
sometimes
did
and
lady
isabel
did
not
allow
her
daughter
to
take
up
the
fashionable
practice
of
bicycling
in
battersea
park
at
which
queenie
torrance
in
the
neatest
and
most
daring
of
rational
costumes
was
reported
to
excel
once
alex
as
she
had
said
before
in
her
childish
days
asked
lady
isabel
mother
may
i
ask
queenie
torrance
to
tea
here
we
meet
everywhere
and
it
will
be
so
odd
if
i
never
ask
her
to
come
here
besides
i
should
like
to
have
her
i
sorry
alex
but
i
rather
you
contented
yourself
with
meetin
her
in
society
if
you
do
why
said
alex
unwisely
urged
by
some
mysterious
unreason
to
provoke
the
answer
which
she
already
anticipated
with
resentment
she
not
the
sort
of
girl
i
should
care
about
you
being
friends
with
very
much
said
lady
isabel
without
heat
i
hear
she
already
talked
about
alex
knew
what
the
words
meant
uttered
by
her
mother
and
her
circle
of
intimates
why
is
she
being
talked
about
alex
asked
rebelliously
any
girl
who
goes
in
for
being
fast
gets
talked
about
said
lady
isabel
severely
and
it
does
them
no
good
in
the
long
run
either
men
may
flirt
with
girls
of
that
sort
and
like
to
dance
with
them
and
pay
them
attention
but
they
do
marry
them
a
man
likes
his
wife
to
be
simple
and
and
dignified
i
sure
heaps
of
people
would
like
to
marry
queenie
how
do
you
know
lady
isabel
asked
quickly
alex
did
not
reply
she
only
knew
that
men
looked
at
queenie
torrance
as
they
did
not
look
at
other
women
and
true
to
the
traditions
of
youth
and
of
the
race
to
which
she
belonged
the
admiration
of
a
man
for
a
woman
to
her
inexperience
spelt
a
proposal
of
marriage
i
do
want
to
be
hard
on
a
girl
who
is
after
all
very
young
said
lady
isabel
and
of
course
her
father
does
look
after
her
she
is
allowed
to
go
to
restaurants
with
him
and
every
sort
of
thing
not
the
girl
fault
exactly
though
i
do
like
the
way
she
dresses
and
a
wreath
of
artificial
flowers
or
whatever
it
is
she
wears
in
her
hair
is
thoroughly
bad
form
but
one
ca
be
too
particular
alex
and
i
want
you
to
make
a
success
of
things
and
have
the
right
friends
and
not
the
wrong
ones
the
wistful
anxiety
in
her
mother
voice
no
less
than
in
her
glance
at
her
daughter
made
alex
wonder
sensitively
if
perhaps
she
were
secretly
somewhat
disappointed
certainly
no
overwhelming
triumph
had
attended
alex
social
career
she
was
merely
the
daughter
of
a
charming
and
popular
mother
less
pretty
than
many
of
the
season
débutantes
alternately
embarrassingly
or
else
when
she
found
herself
at
her
ease
with
an
unbecomingly
dictatorial
manner
she
had
been
led
to
expect
from
constant
veiled
references
to
the
subject
that
as
soon
as
she
grew
up
opportunity
would
be
afforded
her
to
attain
the
goal
of
every
girl
destiny
that
of
matrimony
girls
who
became
engaged
to
be
married
in
their
first
season
were
a
success
those
who
had
already
twice
or
perhaps
thrice
been
the
round
of
london
gaiety
with
no
tangible
result
of
the
sort
had
almost
invariably
to
give
way
to
a
younger
sister
in
order
that
she
in
her
turn
might
have
the
chances
of
which
they
had
failed
to
profit
of
young
women
of
or
years
old
still
going
yearly
through
the
season
lady
isabel
merely
said
what
a
pity
for
the
first
time
a
disquieting
twinge
seized
alex
lest
the
same
words
should
apply
to
her
no
one
had
shown
her
the
faintest
inclination
to
ask
her
in
marriage
or
even
express
any
particular
admiration
for
her
she
could
not
imagine
any
of
the
men
whom
she
knew
falling
in
love
with
her
at
balls
or
she
made
conversation
with
her
partners
they
never
grew
to
know
one
another
more
intimately
sometimes
she
had
heard
girls
talk
of
looking
forward
to
some
forthcoming
entertainment
because
they
knew
that
their
particular
friends
would
be
there
she
herself
did
not
care
she
was
on
the
same
terms
with
all
of
them
polite
impersonal
mutually
rather
bored
and
boring
the
nearest
approach
to
intercourse
other
than
merely
surface
that
she
attained
to
was
with
queenie
most
openly
declared
worshipper
maurice
goldstein
his
manner
to
all
women
verged
upon
the
effusive
and
alex
was
secretly
faintly
ashamed
of
feeling
slightly
but
perceptibly
flattered
at
the
deference
which
he
showed
her
and
even
at
his
favourite
mannerism
of
gazing
straight
into
her
eyes
as
he
shook
hands
with
her
on
meeting
or
parting
although
lady
isabel
never
invited
him
to
clevedon
square
and
sometimes
spoke
of
him
as
that
dreadful
young
jew
who
seems
to
get
himself
asked
everywhere
she
did
not
forbid
alex
to
dance
with
him
and
he
was
the
only
young
man
of
her
acquaintance
who
invariably
asked
her
to
keep
a
second
dance
for
him
later
in
the
evening
she
felt
greatly
curious
as
to
his
sentiment
for
queenie
partly
from
youth
love
of
romance
partly
from
a
desire
to
find
out
if
she
could
both
the
cause
and
the
effect
of
the
process
known
as
falling
in
love
if
she
knew
more
about
it
she
felt
dimly
perhaps
it
might
happen
also
to
her
one
night
towards
the
end
of
the
season
at
the
last
big
ball
she
was
to
attend
that
year
alex
was
taken
down
to
supper
by
maurice
goldstein
she
was
surprised
and
for
a
moment
flattered
for
queenie
was
also
present
although
she
had
apparently
vouchsafed
him
neither
word
nor
look
goldstein
gave
alex
his
arm
and
conducted
her
ceremoniously
downstairs
to
the
it
was
late
in
the
evening
only
four
or
five
couples
or
an
occasional
group
of
three
or
four
lingered
at
the
small
round
tables
shall
we
come
here
said
goldstein
rather
morosely
he
selected
a
table
in
a
remote
corner
and
as
she
took
her
seat
alex
perceived
that
they
were
within
sight
of
the
alcove
where
sat
queenie
torrance
with
her
partner
a
young
danish
diplomat
whom
alex
knew
only
by
sight
who
is
that
she
asked
almost
involuntarily
as
goldstein
lowering
gaze
followed
the
direction
of
her
own
the
young
man
beside
her
needed
no
more
to
make
him
launch
out
into
emphatic
speech
alex
was
half
frightened
as
she
watched
the
glow
in
his
eyes
and
the
rapid
gesticulations
of
his
hands
as
though
emotion
had
startled
him
into
a
display
of
the
racial
characteristics
that
he
habitually
concealed
so
carefully
he
told
her
crudely
that
he
adored
queenie
and
that
it
drove
him
nearly
mad
to
see
her
in
the
company
of
other
men
but
why
do
you
ask
her
to
marry
you
exclaimed
alex
innocently
goldstein
stared
at
her
i
have
asked
her
fourteen
times
he
said
at
last
with
a
slight
gasp
fourteen
times
alex
was
astounded
according
to
her
preconceived
notions
a
proposal
was
carefully
led
up
to
uttered
at
some
propitious
moment
preferably
by
moonlight
and
then
and
there
either
definitely
accepted
or
rejected
but
i
should
have
thought
you
even
seen
her
fourteen
times
she
remarked
naïvely
i
see
her
every
day
goldstein
said
gloomily
it
playing
the
deuce
with
my
business
you
wo
give
me
away
i
know
you
her
friend
are
you
and
people
are
so
stupid
and
conventional
they
might
talk
alex
remembered
lady
isabel
was
this
what
she
had
meant
i
can
always
manage
to
see
her
i
know
her
movements
and
when
i
can
meet
her
and
when
i
may
take
her
out
to
lunch
or
tea
some
quiet
place
of
course
alex
was
puzzled
but
are
you
engaged
yes
a
thousand
times
he
answered
in
low
vehement
tones
and
then
appeared
to
recollect
himself
she
has
never
said
no
although
i
induce
her
to
say
yes
he
admitted
and
i
have
to
see
her
surrounded
and
admired
everywhere
she
goes
and
have
no
hold
on
her
whatever
if
she
would
only
marry
me
he
made
a
gesture
of
rather
theatrical
despair
indicating
the
far
corner
where
the
young
dane
still
sat
oblivious
of
everything
but
queenie
drooping
over
the
small
round
table
that
separated
them
cad
he
going
to
smoke
goldstein
muttered
furiously
below
his
breath
the
room
had
emptied
and
alex
saw
queenie
deliberately
glance
over
her
shoulder
as
though
to
make
sure
of
being
unobserved
her
eyes
moved
unseeingly
across
alex
and
maurice
goldstein
the
rest
of
the
room
was
empty
with
a
little
of
her
white
shoulders
she
delicately
took
a
cigarette
from
the
case
that
the
diplomat
was
eagerly
proffering
it
was
the
first
time
that
alex
had
seen
a
woman
with
a
cigarette
between
her
lips
she
felt
herself
colouring
hotly
as
she
watched
with
involuntary
fascination
queenie
partner
carefully
lighting
the
cigarette
for
her
his
hand
very
close
to
her
face
she
dared
not
look
at
goldstein
the
cheap
vulgarity
of
display
of
modern
freedom
shocked
her
sincerely
nor
could
even
her
inexperience
blind
her
to
the
underlying
motive
governing
every
gesture
she
fumbled
hastily
for
her
fan
and
gloves
shall
we
come
upstairs
again
she
asked
in
a
stifled
voice
goldstein
rose
without
a
word
alex
venturing
to
cast
one
glance
at
him
saw
that
his
face
had
grown
white
as
he
took
her
back
to
lady
isabel
he
spoke
in
a
quick
low
dramatic
voice
between
clenched
teeth
you
saw
she
knows
she
is
driving
me
frantic
but
after
this
it
all
over
alex
was
frightened
and
yet
exultant
at
playing
even
a
secondary
rôle
in
what
seemed
to
her
to
be
a
drama
of
reality
an
hour
later
sitting
for
the
time
being
partnerless
beside
her
mother
she
saw
queenie
the
ballroom
followed
by
the
dane
queenie
eyes
were
throwing
a
glance
innocent
appealing
the
length
of
the
long
room
at
once
her
eyelids
dropped
again
but
in
that
instant
maurice
goldstein
had
left
the
wall
against
which
he
had
been
leaning
listless
and
and
was
making
his
way
through
the
lessening
crowd
alex
wondering
saw
him
reach
the
side
of
the
tall
figure
and
claim
her
from
the
young
diplomat
he
gravely
offered
queenie
his
arm
and
alex
saw
them
no
more
that
night
she
herself
drove
home
to
clevedon
square
beside
lady
isabel
with
her
mind
in
a
tumult
she
felt
that
for
the
first
time
she
had
seen
love
at
close
quarters
and
although
a
faint
but
bitter
regret
that
the
experience
had
not
been
a
personal
one
underlay
all
her
sensations
she
was
full
of
excitement
no
more
late
nights
after
this
week
said
lady
isabel
her
voice
sleepy
a
rest
will
do
you
good
alex
you
are
losing
your
freshness
alex
scarcely
listened
she
stood
impatiently
while
the
weary
maid
whose
duty
it
was
to
sit
up
for
her
mistress
return
undid
the
complicated
fastenings
of
her
frock
and
took
the
pins
out
of
her
hair
i
brush
it
myself
said
alex
hastily
mother
do
come
down
till
alex
we
are
not
doing
anything
alex
carried
her
ball
dress
carefully
over
her
arm
and
went
up
one
more
flight
of
stairs
to
her
own
room
wrapped
in
her
pink
and
with
her
hair
loose
on
her
shoulders
sitting
on
the
edge
of
her
bed
and
gazing
at
her
own
reflection
in
the
big
swinging
mirror
she
made
personal
application
of
the
small
fragment
of
human
drama
that
she
had
just
witnessed
what
man
would
speak
and
think
of
her
as
maurice
goldstein
spoke
and
thought
of
queenie
torrance
when
would
any
man
ardent
glance
answer
hers
any
man
make
his
way
to
her
through
a
crowd
in
response
to
the
silent
summons
of
her
eyes
she
fell
into
one
of
the
idle
romantic
dreams
evoked
by
a
imagination
untempered
by
any
light
of
experience
but
the
hero
of
the
dream
was
a
nebulous
shadowy
figure
of
fiction
no
man
of
flesh
and
blood
held
any
place
in
the
slender
fabric
of
her
fancies
it
occurred
to
her
more
with
a
sense
of
disconcertment
than
of
that
panic
which
was
to
come
later
that
she
did
not
possess
the
power
of
drawing
any
reality
from
her
communion
with
others
and
that
no
intimacy
other
than
one
of
the
surface
had
as
yet
ever
resulted
from
any
intercourse
of
hers
with
her
her
nearest
approach
to
reality
had
been
that
irrational
adoration
of
her
schooldays
for
queenie
torrance
that
had
met
with
no
return
and
with
so
much
and
such
universal
condemnation
alex
did
not
doubt
that
the
condemnation
was
justified
the
impression
left
upon
her
adolescent
mind
remained
ineradicable
it
was
wrong
to
attach
so
much
importance
to
loving
it
was
in
some
mysterious
culpable
way
to
feel
as
she
did
that
nothing
mattered
except
the
people
one
loved
that
nothing
was
so
much
worth
while
as
the
affection
and
understanding
which
one
knew
so
well
from
oneself
must
exist
and
for
the
bestowal
of
which
on
one
own
lonely
ardent
spirit
one
prayed
so
passionately
and
all
these
desires
being
wrong
and
unlike
other
people
must
at
all
costs
be
concealed
and
denied
thus
alex
placing
the
perverted
and
yet
unescapable
interpretation
of
her
disconsolate
youth
upon
such
experience
of
life
as
had
been
vouchsafed
to
her
still
sitting
on
the
side
of
the
bed
and
facing
the
she
sought
in
her
own
reflection
for
traces
of
the
spell
wielded
by
queenie
torrance
she
had
not
yet
outgrown
the
belief
that
beauty
and
the
power
to
attract
should
be
synonymous
was
she
as
pretty
as
queenie
her
colour
was
bright
and
pure
and
her
hazel
eyes
reflected
the
brown
lights
gleaming
in
her
soft
tumbled
hair
that
fell
no
lower
than
her
shoulders
she
reflected
disconsolately
on
the
undue
prominence
of
the
two
white
front
teeth
that
the
plate
which
had
tormented
her
childhood
had
just
failed
to
render
level
with
the
others
straight
brows
added
to
the
regularity
of
her
features
only
the
corners
of
her
mouth
habitually
drooping
very
slightly
the
angularity
which
lady
isabel
so
regretted
was
sharply
manifested
in
the
exposed
just
above
the
open
and
in
the
childishly
thin
arms
and
wrists
with
an
odd
detached
shrewdness
she
appraised
the
prominent
attributes
of
her
own
appearance
its
ungraceful
immaturity
as
she
got
slowly
into
bed
she
passed
other
moral
attributes
in
fleeting
review
alex
believed
that
one
might
be
loved
for
one
goodness
if
not
for
one
beauty
but
she
could
not
suppose
herself
to
be
good
the
tradition
of
the
nursery
black
sheep
still
clung
to
her
should
love
come
to
her
she
had
nothing
but
the
force
of
the
answer
within
her
to
bring
to
it
and
that
force
she
had
been
taught
to
think
of
in
the
light
of
an
affliction
to
be
overcome
yet
alex
clare
fell
asleep
smiling
a
little
nursing
the
foolish
romantic
fancies
that
usurped
the
place
of
realities
and
unaware
that
the
temperament
which
craves
to
give
all
is
often
that
of
which
least
will
ever
be
asked
ix
scotland
queenie
engagement
to
young
goldstein
was
formally
announced
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
following
that
one
in
which
alex
made
her
début
a
most
suitable
match
i
should
imagine
was
lady
isabel
emphasized
comment
alex
was
romantically
delighted
and
hoped
for
an
opportunity
of
obtaining
impressions
queenie
however
sent
only
the
most
conventional
of
notes
in
reply
to
alex
eagerly
written
congratulation
and
alex
had
only
a
glimpse
of
her
at
the
crowded
wedding
exquisitely
pale
and
pure
under
her
veil
with
goldstein
his
swarthy
face
radiant
and
illuminated
at
her
side
remembering
the
night
when
the
young
jew
had
spoken
to
her
freely
of
his
adoration
for
her
friend
alex
with
awkward
fervour
addressed
a
few
words
of
ardent
congratulation
to
him
he
showed
his
remarkably
white
teeth
in
a
quick
smile
brilliant
with
triumph
and
happiness
and
wrung
her
hand
warmly
but
alas
his
eyes
failed
to
answer
her
gaze
and
it
was
obvious
that
no
deeper
issues
between
them
held
any
place
in
his
recollections
alex
went
away
vaguely
disappointed
and
humiliated
she
who
so
longed
for
a
first
place
seemed
doomed
to
relegation
to
the
ranks
even
at
home
there
was
no
longer
any
excitement
such
as
that
which
had
surrounded
her
launch
into
the
great
world
and
lady
isabel
occasionally
betrayed
a
hint
of
disappointment
that
no
family
council
had
as
yet
been
required
on
the
subject
of
alex
future
such
as
those
which
had
punctuated
the
epoch
of
her
own
brief
girlhood
indeed
it
was
rather
barbara
who
was
the
centre
of
attention
she
still
suffered
from
backache
and
general
languor
consequent
upon
growth
during
the
year
she
had
spent
on
the
flat
of
her
back
old
nurse
pitied
and
was
much
inclined
to
spoil
her
dosed
her
religiously
with
a
glass
of
port
at
eleven
every
morning
and
supported
her
whining
assertions
that
lessons
with
mademoiselle
made
her
i
want
to
go
to
school
said
barbara
inconsistently
alex
went
to
school
so
why
should
i
darlin
child
you
know
very
well
that
your
father
wo
hear
of
girls
goin
to
school
a
convent
is
quite
different
but
i
certainly
send
you
to
that
sort
of
establishment
after
the
trick
they
played
me
with
alex
sendin
her
back
and
with
her
hands
all
chapped
and
red
and
covered
with
chilblains
again
said
lady
isabel
barbara
sulked
she
sulked
so
long
and
so
effectively
that
the
unfortunate
mademoiselle
came
of
her
own
accord
to
implore
that
barbara
might
be
released
from
the
schoolroom
she
was
not
learning
anything
and
her
example
was
making
little
pamela
naughty
and
defiant
what
a
plague
children
are
lady
isabel
said
helplessly
she
consulted
her
friends
drawing
a
plaintively
humorous
picture
of
the
recalcitrant
young
person
which
to
the
annoyance
of
alex
caused
a
certain
amount
of
amused
sympathy
to
be
expressed
in
barbara
favour
at
last
some
one
suggested
that
she
should
be
sent
abroad
not
to
a
school
or
a
convent
certainly
not
every
one
was
unanimous
on
that
point
excepting
one
or
two
old
aunts
of
sir
francis
but
to
a
charming
marquise
living
at
neuilly
and
desirous
of
companionship
for
her
only
child
a
girl
of
about
the
same
age
as
barbara
she
will
learn
to
speak
french
like
a
native
and
have
dancing
and
singing
lessons
with
the
hélène
child
and
go
to
all
the
art
galleries
and
places
that
girl
of
the
duchess
went
there
to
be
finished
just
before
she
came
out
and
it
and
she
came
back
so
much
improved
knowing
how
to
put
on
her
clothes
you
know
just
the
sort
of
thing
that
makes
all
the
difference
so
spoke
lady
isabel
enthusiastic
friends
barbara
was
not
consulted
but
when
the
plans
had
been
finally
settled
upon
and
everything
arranged
she
was
told
in
accordance
with
the
usage
of
her
day
that
as
she
was
so
discontented
and
troublesome
at
home
her
parents
felt
obliged
for
the
sake
of
the
younger
children
to
send
her
away
from
them
barbara
following
her
wont
said
nothing
at
all
and
did
not
relax
her
pouting
expression
but
once
back
in
the
schoolroom
again
she
jumped
up
and
down
on
the
sofa
in
a
manner
denoting
extravagant
glee
i
knew
they
have
to
give
in
she
chanted
i
knew
they
would
i
knew
they
would
for
a
long
while
she
teased
archie
and
pamela
by
refusing
to
give
them
any
explanation
and
at
the
same
time
exciting
their
curiosity
by
her
continual
reference
to
an
approaching
triumphant
emancipation
for
her
until
cedric
home
for
the
easter
holidays
and
expert
in
the
administrations
of
schoolboy
tortures
ruthlessly
made
use
of
them
to
reduce
his
sister
to
her
proper
position
of
inferiority
barbara
was
sent
to
neuilly
early
in
april
and
alex
proceeded
to
enter
upon
the
second
phase
of
her
social
career
it
was
less
of
a
success
than
her
first
season
had
been
it
was
assumed
that
she
had
by
this
time
made
her
own
friends
and
her
mother
contemporaries
accordingly
took
less
pains
in
the
matter
of
introductions
on
her
behalf
if
it
be
true
that
nothing
succeeds
like
success
it
is
truer
still
that
nothing
fails
so
completely
as
a
failure
when
alex
had
sat
out
four
or
five
dances
at
a
ball
partnerless
her
conviction
of
her
own
social
degradation
was
absolutely
overwhelming
her
surroundings
only
interested
her
as
a
background
to
her
own
personality
and
as
she
derived
no
pleasure
but
only
disappointment
and
mortification
from
the
majority
of
the
functions
at
which
she
was
present
her
young
expressive
face
unconsciously
advertised
both
her
vexation
and
the
cause
of
it
her
youth
and
her
vanity
alike
were
in
rebellion
against
the
truth
which
she
more
than
half
divined
that
she
who
so
longed
to
please
and
to
attract
was
as
utterly
devoid
of
that
magnetic
charm
possessed
by
other
girls
in
a
lesser
and
by
queenie
goldstein
in
supreme
degree
as
it
was
possible
for
a
reasonably
pretty
and
healthy
young
girl
to
be
neither
her
health
nor
her
beauty
improved
moreover
late
hours
in
her
case
uncounteracted
by
the
vivid
sparkle
of
enjoyment
drew
unbecoming
dark
circles
beneath
her
eyes
and
the
physical
fatigue
always
engendered
in
her
by
boredom
was
most
unmistakably
manifested
in
her
slouching
shoulders
and
mournful
pallor
a
son
air
bête
memory
mercilessly
recalled
to
her
the
old
gibe
of
her
schoolmates
sometimes
as
she
felt
against
her
own
will
her
features
stiffening
into
the
stupid
look
which
had
met
with
the
mocking
of
her
companions
do
try
and
cheer
up
darlin
lady
isabel
sometimes
said
with
more
impatience
than
compassion
in
her
voice
as
she
glanced
at
her
daughter
and
the
implication
that
her
looks
were
betraying
her
feelings
made
alex
more
wretched
and
than
ever
she
often
saw
queenie
goldstein
as
much
surrounded
as
in
the
days
before
her
marriage
and
her
excessive
now
enhanced
by
the
jewels
showered
upon
her
by
her
husband
queenie
once
invited
her
to
a
at
her
little
house
in
curzon
street
but
alex
knew
that
she
would
not
be
allowed
to
go
and
showed
the
invitation
with
great
trepidation
to
her
mother
very
impertinent
of
her
why
she
never
been
introduced
to
me
i
should
dream
of
allowin
any
daughter
of
mine
to
go
and
dine
with
people
whom
i
did
know
personally
even
if
they
were
all
right
lady
isabel
so
and
tepidly
affectionate
towards
her
children
was
adamant
where
her
social
creed
was
concerned
in
any
case
alex
i
told
you
before
that
i
do
want
you
to
go
on
with
the
acquaintance
that
goldstein
woman
is
gettin
herself
talked
about
unless
i
very
much
mistaken
again
that
mysterious
accusation
alex
said
no
more
but
wondered
naïvely
how
the
phase
that
had
been
used
in
connection
with
queenie
torrance
could
still
be
applicable
to
maurice
goldstein
wife
surely
married
women
did
not
flirt
the
term
to
alex
symbolized
she
knew
not
what
of
offensive
coquetry
and
of
general
bad
form
this
belief
had
been
inculcated
into
her
as
a
precept
but
nevertheless
she
could
not
divest
herself
of
a
secret
suspicion
that
although
lady
isabel
might
have
rebuked
she
would
not
have
been
altogether
averse
from
a
lapse
or
two
in
that
direction
on
the
part
of
her
daughter
but
alex
embarked
upon
no
flirtation
the
men
who
danced
with
her
or
took
her
in
to
dinner
never
seemed
desirous
of
talking
personalities
they
made
perfunctory
remarks
about
the
decorations
of
the
tables
the
quality
of
the
floor
and
the
music
and
the
revival
of
the
gilbert
and
sullivan
operas
the
sense
that
the
intercourse
between
them
must
be
sustained
by
conversation
never
left
her
for
an
instant
there
had
been
one
occasion
when
she
had
actually
forgotten
to
think
of
herself
and
of
the
effect
she
might
be
producing
and
had
joined
with
real
interest
in
a
discussion
about
books
with
a
man
a
great
deal
older
than
herself
who
happened
to
be
placed
next
to
her
at
a
big
dinner
party
lady
isabel
opposite
had
glanced
once
or
twice
at
her
daughter
unusually
animated
expression
you
seemed
to
be
gettin
on
very
well
with
the
man
on
your
other
side
not
the
one
who
took
you
down
but
the
oldish
one
she
said
afterwards
in
a
pleased
voice
i
never
found
out
his
name
said
alex
he
told
me
he
wrote
books
it
was
so
interesting
we
were
talking
about
poetry
a
lot
of
the
time
her
mother
face
lost
something
of
its
smile
oh
my
darling
she
exclaimed
in
sudden
flattened
tones
do
go
and
get
a
reputation
for
being
whatever
you
do
people
do
dislike
that
sort
of
thing
so
much
in
a
girl
alex
her
solitary
triumph
killed
knew
that
there
was
yet
another
item
to
be
added
to
that
invisible
score
of
reasons
for
which
one
was
loved
or
disliked
by
one
without
formulating
the
conviction
to
herself
she
believed
implicitly
that
in
the
careful
simulation
of
those
attributes
which
she
had
been
told
would
provoke
admiration
or
affection
lay
her
only
chance
of
obtaining
something
of
that
which
she
craved
dismayed
wearied
and
uncheered
by
success
she
continued
to
act
out
her
little
feeble
comedies
at
the
end
of
her
second
season
she
felt
very
old
and
very
much
disillusioned
this
was
not
real
life
as
she
had
thought
to
find
it
on
leaving
schooldays
behind
her
there
must
be
something
beyond
some
happy
reality
that
should
reveal
the
wherefore
of
all
existence
but
alex
knew
not
where
to
find
it
morbidity
was
a
word
which
had
no
place
in
the
vocabulary
of
her
surroundings
but
lady
isabel
said
to
her
rather
plaintively
you
must
try
and
look
more
cheerful
alex
dear
when
i
take
you
about
your
father
is
quite
vexed
when
he
sees
such
a
gloomy
face
you
enjoy
things
do
you
and
alex
in
her
complicated
disappointment
at
disappointing
her
mother
and
father
answered
hastily
in
the
affirmative
in
the
autumn
in
scotland
she
met
noel
cardew
again
they
were
staying
at
the
same
house
alex
felt
childishly
proud
of
saying
when
her
hostess
brought
the
young
man
to
her
side
with
a
word
of
introduction
oh
but
we
met
before
i
know
him
well
she
wished
that
she
had
spoken
less
emphatically
at
the
sight
of
politely
smile
it
was
evident
that
he
had
not
the
faintest
recollection
of
the
meeting
at
his
mother
house
in
devonshire
she
reminded
him
of
it
rather
shyly
oh
yes
of
course
you
were
at
school
with
my
young
cousins
i
remember
you
coming
over
to
see
us
quite
well
with
your
brothers
we
all
played
hunt
the
slipper
or
something
did
we
said
alex
literally
she
wondered
why
encounters
which
remained
quite
vividly
in
her
own
memory
should
always
appear
to
present
themselves
so
indistinctly
and
trivially
to
other
people
i
have
heard
from
your
cousins
for
a
long
while
are
they
in
america
diana
is
in
india
of
course
she
married
you
know
a
fellow
in
the
indian
police
i
remember
said
alex
determined
to
ignore
the
tiny
prick
of
jealousy
that
now
habitually
assailed
her
almost
every
time
that
she
heard
of
the
marriage
of
another
girl
are
the
other
two
married
she
made
resolute
inquiry
oh
no
why
marie
is
properly
yet
they
are
both
in
america
i
some
idea
of
going
over
to
new
york
myself
next
year
and
i
suppose
i
shall
stay
with
their
people
my
uncle
at
the
embassy
you
know
it
would
be
splendid
to
see
new
york
said
alex
with
the
old
imitation
of
enthusiasm
i
should
like
the
journey
as
well
young
cardew
remarked
board
ship
is
an
awfully
good
way
of
studying
human
nature
i
fancy
and
i
rather
keen
on
that
sort
of
thing
in
fact
i
a
mad
idea
of
perhaps
writing
a
book
one
of
these
days
probably
in
the
form
of
a
novel
because
only
by
gilding
the
pill
that
you
can
get
the
great
to
swallow
it
but
it
really
be
a
kind
of
philosophy
of
life
you
know
with
a
good
deal
about
the
different
sides
of
human
nature
it
may
sound
rather
ambitious
perhaps
but
i
believe
it
could
be
done
alex
assented
eagerly
and
wondered
what
the
initials
that
he
had
used
the
great
represented
she
glanced
at
him
sideways
he
was
even
than
he
had
been
as
a
boy
his
sunburn
of
a
deeper
tan
and
the
still
noticeable
cast
in
one
eye
adding
a
certain
character
to
the
straightness
of
his
features
he
had
grown
a
little
fair
moustache
contrasting
pleasantly
with
his
light
brown
eyes
the
boyish
immaturity
of
the
loosely
knit
figure
was
obscured
to
her
eyes
by
the
excellence
of
his
carriage
and
his
five
foot
eleven
inches
of
height
she
was
inwardly
almost
incredulously
pleased
when
he
chose
the
place
next
to
hers
at
breakfast
on
the
following
morning
and
asked
whether
she
was
going
out
to
join
the
guns
at
lunch
on
the
moors
i
think
so
said
alex
she
would
have
liked
to
say
i
hope
so
but
something
within
her
attached
such
an
exaggerated
importance
to
the
words
that
she
found
herself
unable
to
utter
them
well
said
noel
i
shall
look
out
for
you
so
mind
you
come
alex
gratification
was
transparently
evident
she
was
the
only
girl
of
the
party
which
was
a
small
one
and
lady
isabel
declaring
herself
obliged
to
write
letters
sent
her
out
at
under
the
care
of
her
hostess
they
lunched
on
the
moors
with
the
five
men
two
of
whom
had
only
come
over
for
the
day
noel
cardew
at
once
established
himself
at
alex
side
and
began
to
expatiate
upon
the
day
sport
he
talked
a
great
deal
and
was
as
full
of
theories
as
in
their
schoolroom
days
and
alex
on
her
side
listened
with
the
same
intense
hope
that
her
sympathy
might
continue
to
retain
him
beside
her
she
answered
him
with
eager
monosyllables
and
ejaculations
expressive
of
interest
without
analysing
her
own
motives
it
seemed
to
her
to
be
so
important
that
noel
cardew
should
continue
to
address
his
attention
exclusively
to
her
that
she
was
content
entirely
to
sink
her
own
individuality
into
that
of
a
sympathetic
listener
when
she
dressed
for
dinner
that
evening
and
looked
at
herself
in
the
big
mirror
it
seemed
to
her
that
for
the
first
time
her
own
appearance
was
entirely
satisfactory
she
felt
and
happy
and
after
dinner
when
the
elders
of
the
party
sat
down
to
play
cards
she
declared
boldly
that
she
wanted
to
look
at
the
garden
by
moonlight
rather
said
noel
cardew
they
went
out
together
through
the
open
french
window
alex
held
up
her
white
satin
with
one
hand
and
walked
up
and
down
with
him
under
the
glowing
red
globe
of
the
full
moon
noel
talked
about
his
book
taking
her
interest
for
granted
in
a
manner
that
flattered
and
delighted
her
i
think
psychology
is
simply
the
most
absorbing
thing
in
the
world
he
declared
earnestly
i
hope
you
do
fight
shy
of
long
words
do
you
alex
uttered
a
breathless
disclaimer
i
glad
so
many
people
seem
to
think
that
if
any
one
says
anything
in
words
of
more
than
two
syllables
it
affectation
oxford
and
that
sort
of
thing
but
of
course
you
not
like
that
are
you
he
did
not
wait
for
an
answer
this
time
but
went
on
talking
very
eagerly
about
the
scheme
that
he
entertained
for
obtaining
material
for
his
book
it
might
revolutionize
the
whole
standard
of
moral
values
in
the
country
he
said
very
simply
you
know
just
put
things
in
a
light
that
has
struck
home
in
england
yet
at
all
of
course
on
the
continent
they
far
more
advanced
than
we
are
on
those
sort
of
points
that
why
i
want
to
travel
before
i
start
serious
work
of
course
i
got
a
mass
of
notes
already
just
ideas
that
have
struck
me
as
i
go
along
i
afraid
i
fearfully
observant
and
i
generally
size
up
the
people
i
meet
and
then
make
notes
about
them
or
else
simply
dismiss
them
from
my
mind
altogether
my
idea
is
rather
to
classify
human
nature
into
various
so
that
the
book
can
be
divided
up
under
different
headings
and
then
have
a
sort
of
general
summing
up
at
the
end
of
course
that
only
a
rough
sketch
of
the
whole
plan
but
you
see
what
i
mean
yes
i
do
said
alex
with
conviction
i
always
all
my
life
thought
that
mattered
much
more
than
anything
else
only
never
found
anybody
else
who
felt
like
that
too
it
rather
interesting
to
look
at
things
the
same
way
do
you
think
noel
enquired
oh
yes
alex
answered
with
shy
fervour
her
heart
beating
very
fast
she
was
only
anxious
to
prolong
the
and
had
no
idea
of
suggesting
a
return
to
the
in
spite
of
the
damage
that
she
subconsciously
felt
the
damp
ground
to
be
doing
to
her
satin
slippers
but
presently
lady
isabel
called
to
her
from
the
window
and
she
came
into
the
lighted
room
conscious
both
of
her
own
glowing
face
and
of
a
certain
kindly
interested
look
bent
upon
her
by
her
seniors
x
noel
in
the
ensuing
days
alex
met
that
look
very
often
a
look
of
pleased
speculative
approval
pregnant
with
unspoken
meanings
noel
sought
her
company
incessantly
and
every
opportunity
was
given
them
of
spending
time
in
one
another
society
for
five
glowing
days
and
five
breathless
moonlit
evenings
they
became
the
centre
of
their
tiny
world
then
lady
isabel
said
one
night
to
her
daughter
you
enjoyed
this
visit
have
you
darlin
i
sorry
we
on
oh
said
alex
faintly
are
we
really
leaving
tomorrow
tomorrow
morning
by
the
early
train
her
mother
assented
cheerfully
the
true
instinct
of
the
feeble
to
clutch
at
an
unripe
prize
lest
it
be
taken
from
them
made
alex
wonder
desperately
if
she
could
not
postpone
her
departure
but
she
dared
not
make
any
such
suggestion
and
lady
isabel
looking
at
her
dismayed
face
laughed
a
little
as
though
at
the
unreason
of
a
child
alex
blushed
with
shame
as
she
thought
that
her
mother
might
have
guessed
what
was
in
her
mind
that
evening
however
lady
isabel
came
into
her
room
as
she
was
dressing
for
dinner
i
thought
you
like
to
put
over
your
shoulders
alex
she
said
negligently
it
will
improve
that
frock
of
yours
it
was
a
painted
scarf
that
she
held
out
and
she
stood
gazing
critically
while
the
maid
laid
it
across
alex
shoulders
you
look
so
nice
darling
child
are
you
ready
yes
mother
they
went
downstairs
together
alex
was
acutely
conscious
of
a
certain
maternal
pride
and
tenderness
such
as
she
had
not
experienced
from
lady
isabel
since
the
first
days
of
her
return
from
liège
when
she
had
finally
left
school
she
did
not
let
herself
speculate
to
what
such
unusual
emotion
might
portend
but
at
the
sight
of
noel
cardew
than
ever
in
evening
clothes
a
chaotic
excitement
surged
up
within
her
in
anticipation
of
their
last
evening
together
almost
as
she
sat
down
beside
him
at
the
she
said
piteously
i
wish
we
were
going
away
tomorrow
you
oh
yes
did
you
know
i
had
realized
it
said
noel
and
although
she
avoided
looking
at
him
she
noted
with
a
feeling
of
triumph
the
dismay
in
his
voice
oh
i
say
what
a
shame
must
you
really
go
we
going
to
pay
two
more
visits
and
then
leave
scotland
altogether
i
sha
stay
much
longer
myself
observed
noel
nonchalantly
alex
was
conscious
of
keeping
the
words
as
it
were
at
the
back
of
her
mind
with
the
implication
which
she
attached
to
them
while
the
conversation
at
the
small
table
became
general
as
she
followed
her
hostess
and
lady
isabel
from
the
room
noel
holding
open
the
door
said
to
her
in
a
rapid
anxious
tone
very
low
you
come
out
into
the
garden
afterwards
wo
you
an
enigmatic
perhaps
was
not
in
alex
vocabulary
she
gave
him
a
quick
radiant
smile
and
nodded
emphatically
it
never
occurred
to
her
eager
prodigality
that
she
ran
any
risk
of
cheapening
the
favours
that
so
few
had
ever
coveted
in
the
garden
she
moved
along
the
gravelled
walk
beside
him
actually
breathless
from
inward
excitement
there
was
heaps
more
i
wanted
to
say
to
you
about
the
book
noel
remarked
disconsolately
i
sha
have
any
one
to
exchange
ideas
with
now
they
all
so
old
and
besides
i
do
think
english
people
as
a
rule
care
much
about
psychology
and
that
sort
of
thing
they
so
keen
on
games
so
am
i
in
a
way
but
i
must
say
it
seems
to
me
that
the
study
of
human
nature
is
a
good
deal
more
worth
one
while
people
are
so
interesting
said
alex
she
was
perfectly
aware
of
the
futility
of
her
remark
as
she
made
it
but
in
some
undercurrent
of
her
consciousness
there
floated
the
conviction
that
one
need
not
put
forth
any
great
powers
of
originality
in
order
to
obtain
response
from
noel
cardew
i
can
be
perfectly
with
him
we
think
alike
she
defended
herself
against
her
own
unformulated
accusation
with
inexplicable
anger
i
think
they
frightfully
interesting
said
noel
with
conviction
of
course
men
are
far
more
interesting
than
women
if
you
do
mind
my
saying
so
simply
from
the
psychological
point
of
view
i
hope
you
do
think
i
being
rude
oh
you
see
women
as
a
general
rule
are
rather
shallow
though
of
course
there
are
a
great
many
exceptions
but
you
know
what
i
mean
as
a
rule
they
rather
shallow
that
what
i
feel
about
women
shallow
perhaps
you
right
said
alex
rather
discouraged
she
would
not
admit
to
herself
that
his
sweeping
assertion
awoke
no
echo
whatever
within
her
to
her
immaturity
the
essence
of
sympathy
lay
in
complete
agreement
and
abstract
questions
meant
nothing
to
her
when
weighed
in
the
balance
against
her
desire
to
establish
to
her
own
satisfaction
at
least
the
existence
of
such
sympathy
between
herself
and
noel
cardew
i
got
another
mad
plan
said
noel
slowly
you
think
i
always
getting
insane
ideas
and
this
one
rather
depends
on
you
oh
what
i
hope
you
wo
mind
my
suggesting
such
a
thing
he
paused
so
long
that
alex
imagination
had
time
for
a
hundred
foolish
ecstatic
promptings
such
as
her
reason
knew
could
not
be
forthcoming
but
for
which
her
whole
undisciplined
sense
of
romance
was
crying
well
look
here
what
should
you
think
of
collaborating
with
me
over
the
book
i
sure
you
could
write
if
you
tried
and
anyway
you
could
probably
give
me
sidelights
on
the
feminine
part
of
it
it
would
be
most
awfully
helpful
to
me
if
you
would
oh
said
alex
uncertainly
she
was
invaded
by
unreasoning
disappointment
but
how
could
we
do
it
oh
well
notes
you
know
just
keep
notes
of
anything
that
struck
us
particularly
and
then
put
it
in
together
later
we
should
have
to
do
a
good
deal
of
it
by
correspondence
of
course
i
say
are
you
a
conventional
person
not
in
the
least
said
alex
hastily
i
glad
of
that
i
afraid
i
rather
desperately
unconventional
myself
of
course
in
a
way
it
might
be
rather
unconventional
you
and
me
corresponding
but
would
that
matter
not
to
me
said
alex
resolutely
that
splendid
we
could
do
a
lot
that
way
and
then
i
hope
of
course
that
you
let
me
come
and
see
you
in
london
of
course
alex
cried
eagerly
i
do
know
the
exact
date
when
we
shall
be
back
but
i
could
let
you
know
have
you
got
the
address
clevedon
square
she
hastily
supplied
the
number
of
the
house
oh
that
all
right
i
sure
to
forget
it
said
noel
easily
but
i
shall
find
you
in
the
books
i
suppose
yes
said
alex
feeling
suddenly
damped
she
herself
would
have
been
in
no
danger
of
forgetting
the
number
of
a
house
wherein
dwelt
any
one
whom
she
wished
to
see
but
with
disastrous
and
quite
unconscious
humility
she
told
herself
that
it
was
of
course
not
to
be
expected
that
any
one
else
should
go
to
lengths
equal
to
her
own
in
her
experience
alex
had
always
found
herself
to
be
unique
that
noel
cardew
was
not
in
despair
at
the
idea
of
her
departure
was
evident
but
he
repeated
several
times
that
he
wished
she
were
not
going
so
soon
and
even
asked
whether
she
would
stay
on
if
invited
to
do
so
i
sure
they
all
love
you
to
he
assured
her
then
lady
isabel
could
pay
the
other
visits
and
call
for
you
on
her
way
back
i
sure
i
should
be
allowed
to
stay
on
by
myself
said
alex
dolefully
there
you
are
conventionality
again
daughters
said
noel
instructively
if
i
ever
have
any
shall
be
brought
up
quite
differently
i
made
up
my
mind
to
that
i
daresay
you
laugh
at
all
these
theories
of
mine
but
i
always
been
keen
on
ideas
if
you
remember
but
for
once
noel
did
not
receive
the
habitual
ready
disclaimer
called
for
by
his
speech
his
easy
allusion
to
his
hypothetical
daughters
had
reduced
alex
to
utter
silence
afterwards
alone
in
the
darkness
of
her
own
room
she
wondered
why
such
a
startling
sense
of
protest
had
revolted
within
her
at
his
words
but
her
mind
shied
away
instinctively
from
the
question
and
she
found
herself
unable
to
pursue
it
the
next
morning
in
the
unromantic
atmosphere
induced
by
an
early
breakfast
and
sir
francis
anxiety
to
make
sure
of
catching
the
connection
politely
concealed
but
quite
evident
to
the
perceptions
of
his
wife
and
daughter
noel
cardew
and
alex
exchanged
their
brief
and
entirely
public
farewell
i
write
about
the
book
was
his
cheerful
parting
assurance
do
forget
said
alex
lady
isabel
was
rather
humorous
on
the
subject
of
de
emancipation
amongst
the
house
party
in
the
midst
of
which
she
and
her
daughter
found
themselves
that
evening
what
are
boys
and
girls
coming
to
i
hear
young
men
gaily
promisin
to
write
to
alex
on
all
sorts
of
subjects
and
making
private
assignations
with
her
she
declared
amusedly
are
you
and
that
cardew
boy
writin
a
book
in
collaboration
or
something
darling
the
slight
jest
was
made
popular
amongst
her
seniors
and
alex
was
kindly
rallied
about
her
modern
freedom
and
assumption
of
privileges
undreamed
of
by
the
older
generation
the
inference
obviously
placed
upon
her
friendship
with
noel
cardew
was
evident
and
pleased
her
starved
vanity
even
more
than
the
agreeable
amount
of
flattery
and
attention
which
at
last
was
being
bestowed
upon
her
it
was
her
first
hint
of
success
achieved
amid
standards
which
she
had
been
taught
to
believe
were
brushed
lightly
by
the
passing
wing
of
triumph
she
became
eager
and
even
rather
in
the
assertion
of
her
own
individuality
as
had
been
the
child
alex
in
the
nursery
at
clevedon
square
lady
isabel
did
not
check
her
she
made
subtle
exploitation
of
youth
and
sudden
rather
boisterous
gaiety
and
occasionally
laughed
a
little
and
alluded
to
the
collaboration
scheme
between
her
and
noel
cardew
but
all
the
same
darlin
child
she
observed
to
alex
in
private
i
ca
have
you
correspondin
with
young
men
all
over
the
country
unbeknown
to
me
once
in
a
way
is
all
very
well
perhaps
but
you
have
to
let
me
see
the
letters
i
think
alex
was
only
mildly
resentful
of
the
injunction
she
surmised
shrewdly
enough
that
her
mother
was
more
anxious
to
establish
the
authentic
existence
of
a
correspondence
between
noel
cardew
and
herself
than
to
supervise
the
details
of
it
she
herself
waited
with
frantic
furtive
eagerness
for
his
first
letter
it
did
not
reach
her
until
after
her
return
to
london
secretly
bitterly
disappointed
she
read
the
short
conventional
phrases
and
the
subscription
i
never
know
how
to
end
up
a
letter
but
hope
this
will
be
all
right
yours
very
sincerely
noel
e
cardew
across
the
top
of
the
front
page
was
a
postscript
next
month
i
shall
be
in
town
do
forget
that
i
am
coming
to
call
upon
you
i
hope
you
wo
be
alex
to
whom
nothing
was
trivial
saw
the
proposed
call
looming
enormous
upon
the
horizon
of
her
days
every
afternoon
she
either
sat
beside
lady
isabel
in
the
carriage
in
an
agony
with
only
one
thought
in
her
mind
the
expectation
of
finding
noel
card
upon
the
hall
table
on
their
return
or
else
took
her
part
disjointedly
and
with
obvious
in
the
entertainment
of
her
mother
visitors
when
during
a
crowded
at
home
afternoon
in
the
course
of
which
she
had
necessarily
ceased
to
listen
for
the
sound
of
the
bell
cardew
was
at
length
announced
alex
felt
almost
unable
to
turn
round
and
face
the
entering
visitor
her
own
imagination
untempered
either
by
humour
or
by
experience
had
led
her
to
picture
the
next
encounter
between
herself
and
noel
so
frequently
and
with
such
a
prodigal
folly
of
romantic
detail
that
it
seemed
incredible
to
her
that
the
reality
should
take
place
within
a
few
instants
amidst
brief
conventional
words
and
gestures
noel
did
not
talk
about
the
book
that
they
were
to
write
together
although
he
remained
beside
alex
most
of
the
afternoon
only
just
as
he
was
leaving
he
asked
cheerfully
you
not
forgotten
our
collaboration
have
you
partner
i
heaps
of
things
to
discuss
with
you
only
you
were
so
busy
this
afternoon
looking
after
all
those
people
we
shall
be
in
on
sunday
alex
told
him
eagerly
and
there
wo
be
such
a
crowd
oh
good
said
noel
perhaps
we
meet
in
the
park
before
that
though
i
hope
so
said
alex
they
met
in
the
park
and
elsewhere
and
noel
all
through
the
ensuing
weeks
before
christmas
called
often
at
the
house
in
clevedon
square
lady
isabel
twice
asked
him
to
dinner
but
although
he
was
once
placed
next
her
on
neither
occasion
to
alex
astonished
resentment
was
he
assigned
to
her
as
a
partner
alex
for
the
first
time
conscious
of
being
sought
after
and
receiving
with
avidity
the
fragments
that
fell
to
her
share
forced
herself
to
believe
that
they
would
eventually
constitute
that
impossible
whole
of
which
she
had
dreamed
wildly
and
extravagantly
all
her
life
into
the
eager
assents
which
she
gave
to
all
noel
many
theories
she
read
a
similarity
of
outlook
into
her
almost
trembling
readiness
to
fall
in
with
his
every
suggestion
a
community
of
tastes
and
into
his
interminable
expositions
of
his
own
views
an
appeal
to
her
deeper
sympathies
that
surely
denoted
the
consciousness
of
affinity
between
them
she
was
happy
although
principally
in
a
nervous
anticipation
of
happiness
to
come
she
was
able
when
alone
to
imagine
that
from
absolutely
impersonal
good
comradeship
noel
would
suddenly
plunge
into
the
impassioned
declarations
of
her
own
fancy
but
when
she
was
actually
with
him
his
cool
pleasant
boyish
voice
dispelled
the
folly
and
her
fundamental
shyness
that
never
deserted
her
save
in
the
realm
of
her
own
thoughts
was
relieved
with
an
intense
and
involuntary
relief
that
it
should
be
so
she
saw
noel
father
and
mother
again
and
was
greeted
by
the
latter
with
a
bright
and
conditional
affectionateness
that
inspected
even
while
it
acclaimed
it
was
after
this
that
the
trend
of
noel
thoughts
appeared
suddenly
to
change
and
he
spoke
to
alex
of
the
place
in
devonshire
one
first
duty
is
to
the
place
of
course
he
said
reflectively
and
i
not
at
all
sure
that
i
ought
to
look
into
the
management
of
an
estate
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
very
thoroughly
some
day
a
long
long
time
hence
of
course
i
shall
have
to
run
our
own
place
and
i
rather
keen
about
the
duties
of
a
landlord
and
improving
the
condition
of
the
people
i
used
to
be
a
socialist
as
you
know
but
i
must
say
one
ideas
alter
a
bit
as
one
goes
on
through
life
and
had
some
talks
with
the
pater
lately
he
broke
off
and
looked
rather
oddly
at
alex
for
a
moment
they
want
me
to
think
of
settling
down
i
believe
he
said
almost
shyly
alex
spent
that
night
in
feverishly
placing
possible
and
impossible
interpretations
on
the
words
and
on
the
look
he
had
given
her
the
sense
of
an
approaching
crisis
terrified
her
so
much
that
she
felt
she
would
have
given
worlds
to
avoid
it
the
following
evening
it
came
most
conventionally
she
met
noel
cardew
at
an
evening
reception
and
he
conducted
her
rather
solemnly
to
a
small
conservatory
where
two
chairs
were
placed
conspicuously
enough
beneath
a
solitary
palm
an
orchestra
was
just
audible
above
the
hum
and
buzz
of
conversation
it
luck
getting
in
here
said
noel
i
wanted
to
see
you
very
particularly
tonight
i
must
say
i
never
thought
i
should
find
myself
particularly
wanting
to
see
girl
in
fact
i
practically
made
up
my
mind
never
to
have
anything
to
do
with
women
but
i
see
now
that
two
people
who
had
very
much
the
same
sort
of
ideas
about
life
in
general
could
do
a
tremendous
lot
for
a
place
and
for
the
country
generally
do
you
agree
and
of
course
he
became
hopelessly
incoherent
knowing
one
another
other
people
it
all
makes
such
a
difference
i
could
never
understand
fellows
running
after
gaiety
girls
and
marrying
them
myself
after
all
one
duty
to
the
estate
is
and
then
later
on
perhaps
if
one
thought
of
parliament
alex
felt
that
the
pounding
of
her
heart
was
making
her
physically
faint
and
she
raised
her
head
desperately
in
the
hope
of
stopping
him
noel
met
her
eyes
courageously
i
wish
you
let
me
tell
our
people
that
you
that
we
we
engaged
he
said
hoarsely
his
words
struck
on
alex
ear
almost
meaninglessly
irrationally
in
love
as
she
was
with
love
she
knew
only
that
he
was
asking
something
of
her
that
she
had
at
last
an
outlet
for
that
which
no
one
had
ever
yet
desired
unable
to
speak
and
unconscious
of
bathos
she
vehemently
nodded
her
head
noel
immediately
took
both
her
hands
and
shook
them
wildly
up
and
down
thank
heaven
it
over
he
cried
boyishly
you
ca
imagine
how
i
been
funking
asking
you
i
thought
you
say
yes
but
one
feels
such
an
awful
fool
and
i
never
done
it
before
i
say
alex
i
can
call
you
alex
now
ca
i
you
like
me
are
you
you
do
want
sentimentality
if
there
one
thing
i
bar
said
the
lover
it
sentimentality
xi
engagement
of
marriage
i
am
engaged
to
be
married
alex
repeated
to
herself
in
a
vain
endeavour
to
realize
the
height
to
which
she
must
have
now
attained
but
that
realization
by
which
she
meant
tangible
certainty
for
which
she
craved
continually
eluded
her
the
preliminary
formalities
indeed
duly
took
place
from
her
own
avowal
before
a
lady
isabel
to
noel
formal
interview
with
sir
francis
in
the
traditional
setting
of
the
library
after
that
however
a
freakish
fate
seemed
to
take
control
of
all
the
circumstances
connected
with
alex
engagement
noel
cardew
father
became
ill
and
in
the
uncertainty
consequent
upon
a
state
of
health
which
his
doctor
declared
might
be
almost
indefinitely
prolonged
there
could
be
no
question
of
immediately
announcing
the
engagement
just
as
well
perhaps
we
all
delighted
about
it
but
they
both
young
enough
to
wait
a
little
while
lady
isabel
smilingly
made
the
best
of
it
next
year
will
be
quite
time
enough
to
settle
anything
her
serenity
was
the
obvious
outcome
of
an
extreme
contentment
alex
found
herself
better
able
to
regard
herself
in
the
light
of
one
betrothed
in
her
mother
company
than
in
that
of
noel
he
treated
her
almost
exactly
as
he
had
always
done
with
cheerful
and
only
at
the
very
outset
of
the
engagement
with
any
tinge
of
shyness
in
his
bearing
of
course
i
ought
to
have
got
a
ring
he
said
very
seriously
but
i
do
believe
in
taking
any
chances
and
so
just
in
case
there
was
any
hitch
i
waited
besides
i
do
know
what
you
like
best
you
have
to
choose
alex
smiled
at
the
words
there
was
a
glamour
about
such
a
choice
even
beyond
that
with
which
her
own
sense
of
the
romantic
perforce
enveloped
it
she
wondered
whether
she
would
be
allowed
to
go
with
noel
to
a
jeweller
or
whether
he
would
after
all
choose
his
token
alone
and
bring
it
to
her
and
place
it
on
her
finger
with
one
of
those
low
sentences
which
she
could
hear
so
clearly
in
her
own
mind
and
which
seemed
so
strangely
and
utterly
impossible
in
real
presence
but
the
arrival
of
noel
ring
after
all
took
her
by
surprise
he
had
been
lunching
with
them
in
clevedon
square
when
the
assistant
was
announced
just
as
lady
isabel
was
rising
from
the
she
turned
enquiringly
noel
i
told
him
to
come
here
i
thought
you
would
mind
you
see
i
want
alex
to
choose
her
ring
oh
my
dear
boy
how
very
exciting
but
may
we
see
too
cardew
was
also
present
oh
rather
said
noel
heartily
we
shall
want
your
advice
they
all
trooped
hastily
into
the
library
where
the
man
was
waiting
with
the
very
large
assortment
of
gleaming
rings
ordered
for
inspection
by
noel
what
beauties
said
lady
isabel
but
really
i
do
know
if
i
ought
to
let
him
she
glanced
at
cardew
who
said
in
a
very
audible
voice
of
course
he
so
happy
it
quite
delightful
to
watch
them
both
she
was
looking
hard
and
appraisingly
at
the
rings
as
she
spoke
alex
looked
at
them
too
quite
unseeing
of
their
glittering
magnificence
but
acutely
conscious
that
every
one
was
waiting
for
her
first
word
oh
how
lovely
she
exclaimed
faintly
she
chid
herself
violently
for
the
sick
disappointment
that
invaded
her
not
indeed
at
the
matter
but
at
the
manner
of
the
gift
and
yet
she
realized
dimly
that
it
was
impossible
that
it
should
have
happened
in
any
other
way
that
any
other
way
indeed
would
have
been
as
utterly
uncharacteristic
of
noel
cardew
as
this
was
typical
which
do
you
like
he
asked
her
i
chose
all
the
most
original
ones
i
could
see
i
always
like
unconventional
designs
better
than
conventional
ones
i
afraid
where
that
long
one
you
showed
me
this
morning
the
diamond
marquise
sir
the
assistant
deferentially
produced
it
glancing
the
while
at
alex
that
it
said
noel
eagerly
try
it
on
alex
wo
you
he
used
her
name
quite
freely
and
without
any
shyness
alex
felt
more
of
genuine
excitement
and
less
of
wistful
bewilderment
than
at
any
moment
since
noel
had
first
asked
her
to
marry
him
as
she
shyly
held
out
her
left
hand
and
the
jeweller
slipped
the
heavy
beautiful
ring
onto
her
third
finger
she
had
long
slim
hands
the
fingers
rather
too
thin
and
the
knuckles
though
small
too
prominent
for
beauty
but
thanks
to
the
tyranny
of
old
nurse
and
to
lady
isabel
insistence
upon
the
use
of
nightly
they
were
exquisitely
soft
and
white
the
diamonds
gleamed
and
flashed
at
her
as
she
moved
the
ring
up
and
down
her
finger
we
can
easily
make
it
smaller
to
fit
your
finger
said
the
assistant
it
really
is
beautiful
look
francis
said
lady
isabel
alex
father
put
up
his
glasses
and
after
inspection
he
also
exclaimed
beautiful
you
such
little
fingers
dear
it
have
to
be
made
smaller
said
cardew
graciously
is
it
to
be
that
one
then
lady
isabel
asked
alex
saw
that
her
mother
pretty
flush
of
pleasurable
excitement
had
mounted
to
her
face
she
herself
conscious
of
an
inexplicable
oppression
felt
and
unable
to
do
more
than
repeat
foolishly
and
lifelessly
oh
it
lovely
it
perfectly
lovely
it
beautiful
noel
however
looked
gratified
at
the
words
of
admiration
that
the
one
like
he
said
with
emphasis
i
knew
when
i
saw
them
this
morning
that
i
liked
that
one
much
the
best
we
settle
on
that
one
then
shall
we
you
silly
boy
laughed
his
mother
that
for
alex
to
decide
perhaps
she
likes
something
else
better
try
the
emerald
alex
oh
this
is
lovely
repeated
alex
again
shrinking
back
a
little
furious
with
herself
she
was
yet
only
desirous
that
the
scene
should
not
be
prolonged
any
longer
come
and
look
at
it
in
the
light
the
urgent
pressure
of
lady
hand
on
her
arm
drew
her
into
the
embrasure
of
the
window
alex
said
her
mother
low
and
swiftly
all
the
time
holding
up
her
hand
against
the
light
as
though
studying
the
ring
alex
you
be
more
gracious
what
the
matter
with
you
nothing
said
alex
childishly
feeling
inclined
to
burst
into
tears
then
for
heaven
sake
do
try
and
smile
and
show
a
enthusiasm
said
her
mother
with
unwonted
sharpness
alex
scarlet
and
most
visibly
discomposed
returned
to
the
group
round
the
library
table
forcing
herself
to
make
some
attempt
at
obeying
her
mother
behest
she
picked
up
the
nearest
jewel
two
pearls
in
a
setting
and
began
to
examine
it
i
like
that
design
too
it
original
said
cardew
oh
but
pearls
are
unlucky
she
could
have
pearls
protested
lady
isabel
they
mean
tears
do
they
alex
contributed
to
the
discussion
for
the
sake
of
making
her
mother
see
that
she
was
willing
to
do
her
best
are
you
superstitious
noel
asked
rather
reproachfully
i
ca
say
i
believe
in
all
that
sort
of
thing
myself
you
know
in
fact
i
make
rather
a
principle
of
doing
things
on
a
or
walking
under
ladders
and
all
the
rest
of
it
just
to
prove
there
nothing
in
it
sir
francis
fixed
the
young
man
benevolently
through
his
monocle
i
presume
however
that
in
this
instance
you
prefer
not
to
tempt
the
gods
he
remarked
affably
and
noel
always
obviously
in
awe
of
his
betrothed
father
hastily
agreed
with
him
then
it
diamonds
is
it
unless
alex
prefers
the
emerald
i
like
the
diamond
one
best
noel
reiterated
i
really
pitched
on
that
one
the
minute
i
saw
it
i
like
originality
well
it
could
be
lovelier
said
lady
isabel
contentedly
the
jeweller
was
shown
out
leaving
the
diamond
marquise
ring
in
its
little
case
on
the
table
in
front
of
alex
sir
francis
opened
the
door
for
his
wife
and
cardew
oh
said
noel
urgently
you
stay
and
see
her
put
it
on
both
ladies
laughed
at
the
boyish
exclamation
and
alex
flushed
scarlet
once
more
noel
opened
the
case
and
looked
proudly
at
his
gift
you
must
put
it
on
for
her
said
his
mother
when
it
been
made
smaller
the
hint
was
unmistakable
noel
held
out
the
ring
let
see
it
on
now
at
once
alex
it
can
go
back
to
the
shop
later
alex
in
a
sort
of
utter
desperation
thrust
out
her
hand
and
noel
politely
and
carefully
avoiding
touching
it
with
his
own
slipped
the
heavy
hoop
over
her
finger
thank
you
she
stammered
there
was
another
laugh
poor
dears
let
leave
them
in
peace
cried
cardew
mockingly
and
rustled
to
the
door
again
did
you
ever
see
anything
so
young
as
they
both
are
she
murmured
sweetly
to
lady
isabel
audibly
enough
for
alex
to
guess
at
the
words
if
she
did
not
actually
hear
them
she
was
thankful
that
they
should
no
longer
be
watching
her
and
turned
with
something
like
relief
to
noel
gratified
uncritical
looks
it
became
suddenly
much
easier
to
speak
unconstrainedly
perhaps
she
was
subconsciously
aware
that
of
all
of
them
it
was
noel
himself
who
would
expect
the
least
of
her
because
his
demands
upon
her
were
so
infinitesimal
it
a
beautiful
ring
thank
you
very
very
much
i
she
stopped
and
gulped
then
said
bravely
i
it
she
emphasized
the
word
almost
without
knowing
it
as
though
to
force
from
him
some
response
although
she
had
never
actually
realized
it
it
was
a
word
which
in
point
of
fact
had
never
yet
passed
between
them
noel
fair
face
coloured
at
last
as
his
light
eyes
met
her
unconsciously
tragical
gaze
a
son
air
bête
with
horrid
inappropriateness
the
hated
gibe
of
her
schooldays
flashed
into
alex
thoughts
stiffening
her
face
into
the
old
lines
of
morbid
misery
part
of
her
mind
in
unwilling
detachment
contemplated
ruefully
the
oddly
inadequate
spectacle
which
they
must
present
staring
shamefacedly
at
one
another
across
the
glittering
token
of
their
troth
frenziedly
desirous
of
breaking
the
silence
heavy
with
awkwardness
that
hung
between
them
she
began
to
speak
hastily
and
almost
at
random
thank
you
so
very
much
i
never
had
such
a
lovely
present
lovely
thank
you
so
much
i
thought
you
like
it
muttered
noel
more
overcome
with
confusion
if
possible
than
was
alex
oh
yes
yes
it
lovely
i
thought
you
like
something
rather
original
you
know
not
a
conventional
one
oh
yes
you
sure
you
would
rather
have
one
of
the
others
that
emerald
one
that
mother
liked
oh
no
i
dare
say
they
let
me
change
it
the
man
knows
us
very
well
oh
no
no
well
i
i
i
awfully
glad
you
like
it
yes
i
like
it
i
i
think
it
lovely
i
i
thought
you
like
it
alex
began
to
feel
as
though
she
was
in
a
nightmare
but
she
was
mysteriously
unable
to
put
an
end
to
their
sorry
dialogue
it
perfectly
lovely
i
think
i
do
know
how
to
thank
you
noel
swallowed
two
or
three
times
visibly
and
audibly
and
then
took
a
couple
of
determined
steps
towards
her
i
think
you
you
better
let
me
kiss
you
he
said
hoarsely
you
have
yet
you
know
something
deep
down
within
alex
was
surging
up
in
angry
bewilderment
and
she
was
sufficiently
aware
of
a
sense
of
protest
to
rebut
it
indignantly
and
with
determination
it
was
the
humility
of
love
that
had
prompted
her
lover
to
crave
that
permission
which
should
never
have
been
asked
so
she
told
herself
in
the
flash
of
a
moment
while
she
waited
for
noel
kiss
to
lift
her
once
and
for
all
into
some
far
realm
of
romance
where
trivial
details
of
manifestation
should
no
longer
obscure
the
true
values
of
life
unconsciously
she
had
shut
her
eyes
but
at
an
unaccountable
pause
in
the
proceedings
she
opened
them
again
noel
was
carefully
removing
his
i
say
he
stammered
you
you
sure
you
do
mind
if
alex
had
followed
the
impulse
of
her
own
feelings
she
must
have
cried
out
at
this
juncture
not
if
you
quick
and
get
it
over
but
instead
she
heard
herself
murmuring
feebly
oh
no
not
at
all
she
hastily
raised
her
face
turning
it
sideways
to
noel
and
felt
his
lips
gingerly
touching
the
middle
of
her
cheek
then
she
opened
her
eyes
again
and
scrupulously
avoiding
noel
embarrassed
gaze
saw
him
diligently
polishing
his
before
replacing
them
it
was
the
apotheosis
of
their
alex
possessed
neither
the
which
is
mistakenly
generally
ascribed
to
youth
nor
the
philosophy
to
face
facts
with
any
determination
she
continued
to
cram
her
unwilling
mind
with
illusions
which
her
innermost
self
perfectly
recognized
as
such
it
was
on
the
whole
easier
to
place
her
own
interpretation
upon
every
act
of
commission
or
omission
when
the
shyness
subsequent
to
their
first
embrace
had
left
him
which
it
speedily
did
easier
still
when
intercourse
between
them
was
renewed
upon
much
the
same
terms
of
impersonal
enthusiasm
in
discussion
as
in
scotland
and
easiest
of
all
when
alex
herself
in
retrospect
wrenched
a
sentimental
significance
out
of
words
or
looks
that
had
been
meaningless
at
the
time
of
their
occurrence
when
noel
went
to
devonshire
whither
his
father
by
slow
invalid
degrees
had
at
last
been
allowed
to
move
he
said
to
alex
in
farewell
i
shall
expect
to
hear
from
you
very
often
mind
i
always
like
getting
letters
though
i
afraid
i
not
much
good
at
writing
them
you
know
what
i
mean
i
can
write
simply
pages
if
i
in
the
mood
just
as
though
i
were
talking
to
some
one
and
other
days
i
ca
put
pen
to
paper
i
do
think
i
write
very
good
letters
myself
said
alex
wistfully
in
the
hope
of
eliciting
reassurance
oh
never
mind
said
noel
consolingly
just
write
when
you
feel
like
it
alex
who
had
composed
a
score
of
imaginary
both
on
his
behalf
and
her
own
tried
to
compensate
herself
the
following
evening
for
the
vague
misery
that
was
encompassing
her
spirit
by
writing
she
was
alone
in
her
own
room
the
fire
had
fallen
into
red
embers
and
her
surroundings
were
sufficiently
appropriate
to
render
attainable
the
state
of
mind
which
she
desired
to
achieve
as
she
involuntarily
rehearsed
to
herself
the
elements
of
her
own
situation
she
lulled
herself
into
a
species
of
happiness
his
ring
on
her
finger
his
letter
on
its
way
to
her
she
was
going
to
write
to
the
man
who
had
asked
her
to
become
his
wife
there
was
really
some
one
at
last
alex
told
herself
to
whom
she
had
become
the
centre
of
the
universe
to
whom
her
letters
would
matter
to
whom
everything
that
she
might
think
or
feel
would
be
of
importance
she
remembered
maurice
goldstein
his
knowledge
of
queenie
every
movement
his
triumphant
rapture
at
being
allowed
to
take
her
out
to
luncheon
or
tea
even
now
alex
had
seen
him
follow
his
wife
with
his
ardent
glowing
gaze
as
she
moved
serene
and
graceful
round
a
crowded
room
on
the
arm
of
some
other
man
and
the
look
had
made
her
heart
throb
sympathetically
and
perhaps
not
altogether
unenviously
almost
fiercely
she
told
herself
that
she
had
noel
love
she
was
to
him
what
queenie
was
to
young
goldstein
to
every
rebellious
doubt
that
rose
within
her
she
opposed
the
soundless
vehement
assertions
that
the
indelible
proof
of
noel
love
lay
in
the
fact
that
he
had
asked
her
to
marry
him
gradually
she
persuaded
herself
that
only
her
own
of
which
she
was
never
more
aware
than
when
with
noel
was
responsible
for
that
strange
lack
which
she
dared
not
attempt
to
define
lest
in
so
doing
she
should
shatter
the
feeble
structure
built
out
of
sentimentality
and
resolute
partly
because
she
instinctively
craved
a
relief
to
her
own
feelings
and
partly
because
she
had
really
almost
made
herself
believe
in
the
truth
of
her
own
imaginings
alex
wrote
her
first
the
shy
yet
of
a
young
and
intensely
romantic
girl
in
love
with
the
thought
of
love
too
ignorant
for
reserve
and
yet
too
conscious
of
the
novelty
of
her
own
experience
for
absolute
spontaneity
alex
did
not
sleep
after
she
had
written
her
letter
but
she
lay
in
bed
in
the
warm
soft
glow
of
the
firelight
and
saw
the
square
white
envelope
within
which
she
had
sealed
her
letter
leaning
against
the
silver
inkstand
on
her
when
the
maid
came
to
her
in
the
morning
she
brought
a
letter
addressed
in
noel
unformed
hand
it
was
quite
short
and
began
dearest
alex
is
that
right
it
told
her
of
the
journey
to
devonshire
of
an
improvement
in
the
invalid
state
of
health
and
of
noel
own
projected
tour
of
inspection
round
the
estate
which
he
thought
had
been
neglected
by
his
agent
of
late
but
i
shall
be
able
to
put
all
that
right
i
hope
as
i
rather
keen
about
the
housing
of
the
poor
and
questions
of
that
sort
you
might
look
out
for
any
decent
book
on
social
economy
will
you
alex
the
letter
did
not
extend
beyond
the
bottom
of
the
second
page
but
noel
was
going
to
write
again
in
a
day
or
two
when
there
was
more
to
tell
her
and
with
love
to
every
one
he
was
hers
for
ever
and
a
day
noel
alex
reply
went
to
trevose
the
same
day
but
the
letter
she
had
written
in
the
firelight
she
burnt
xii
christmas
pantomime
the
engagement
was
not
announced
but
a
good
many
people
knew
about
it
their
congratulations
pleased
alex
as
did
her
mother
obvious
pride
and
satisfaction
she
liked
wearing
her
diamond
ring
although
she
only
did
so
at
home
and
she
even
found
pleasure
in
writing
of
her
new
dignities
to
barbara
at
neuilly
in
such
trivial
anodynes
did
alex
seek
oblivion
for
the
terror
that
was
gaining
upon
her
noel
came
back
from
devonshire
after
christmas
and
lady
isabel
sometimes
spoke
tentatively
to
alex
of
a
wedding
early
in
the
season
jubilee
year
would
be
so
charming
for
your
wedding
my
darling
she
said
effusively
alex
thought
of
a
white
satin
dress
and
long
train
of
orange
blossom
and
a
lace
veil
of
bridesmaids
presents
the
exciting
music
of
mendelssohn
wedding
march
and
the
glory
of
a
on
any
other
aspects
of
the
case
her
mind
refused
to
dwell
nevertheless
she
made
little
or
no
response
to
her
mother
hinted
suggestions
neither
noel
nor
alex
ever
exchanged
the
slightest
reference
to
their
marriage
although
noel
often
discoursed
freely
of
a
utopian
future
for
the
tenantry
at
trevose
the
basis
of
which
by
implication
was
his
suzerainty
and
that
of
alex
i
rather
believe
in
the
feudal
system
personally
you
may
say
that
just
the
contrary
of
my
old
socialistic
ideas
alex
but
then
i
always
think
it
a
mistake
to
be
absolutely
in
convictions
one
ought
to
assimilate
new
ideas
as
one
goes
through
life
and
of
course
sometimes
they
bound
to
displace
preconceived
notions
i
a
tremendous
believer
in
it
teaches
one
better
than
anything
else
besides
emerson
says
to
be
inconsistent
i
keen
on
emerson
you
know
are
you
oh
yes
said
alex
enthusiastically
wishing
to
be
sympathetic
but
i
only
read
emerson
a
long
while
ago
when
i
was
at
school
noel
were
you
happy
at
school
oh
yes
said
noel
unemotionally
the
great
thing
at
school
is
to
be
keen
and
get
on
with
the
other
fellows
they
were
always
very
decent
to
me
was
very
happy
said
alex
she
was
passionately
desirous
of
sympathy
and
was
full
of
youth
mistaken
conviction
that
unhappiness
is
provocative
of
interest
noel
cheerfully
and
unconsciously
disabused
her
of
the
idea
of
course
girls
do
have
nearly
such
a
good
time
as
boys
do
at
school
but
do
let
talk
about
rotten
things
like
being
unhappy
i
always
believe
in
taking
things
as
they
come
do
you
i
never
look
back
personally
i
think
it
morbid
one
ought
always
to
be
looking
ahead
i
tell
you
what
i
do
alex
i
give
you
a
copy
of
you
ought
to
read
them
noel
was
very
generous
and
often
made
her
presents
alex
was
disproportionately
grateful
but
to
her
extreme
though
unavowed
relief
he
never
again
claimed
such
a
recognition
as
that
which
had
followed
the
bestowal
of
her
she
drifted
on
from
day
to
day
scarcely
aware
of
her
own
unhappiness
but
wondering
bitterly
why
this
the
supreme
initiation
should
seem
to
fail
her
so
utterly
and
still
hoping
against
hope
that
the
personal
element
for
which
she
looked
so
avidly
might
yet
enter
into
her
relation
with
noel
one
day
she
told
herself
with
shock
of
discovery
that
noel
was
curiously
obtuse
he
had
taken
her
with
lady
isabel
and
his
brother
eric
to
prince
alex
did
not
skate
but
she
enjoyed
hearing
the
band
and
watching
the
skaters
eric
cardew
was
among
the
latter
and
alex
recognized
queenie
goldstein
in
magnificent
furs
noel
do
you
see
that
very
fair
girl
the
one
in
blue
she
was
my
great
friend
at
school
alex
at
the
same
instant
saw
a
look
of
fleeting
but
unmistakable
vexation
on
her
mother
face
at
the
description
why
that
goldstein
is
it
said
noel
screwing
up
his
eyes
in
an
interested
look
yes
i
wish
i
could
catch
her
eye
alex
was
reckless
of
her
mother
i
have
talked
to
her
for
such
a
long
while
do
you
know
her
i
met
her
once
or
twice
could
you
go
and
speak
to
her
and
bring
her
over
here
asked
alex
wistfully
noel
looked
at
her
surprised
i
do
think
i
can
do
that
she
wants
to
skate
of
course
not
broke
in
lady
isabel
do
be
a
little
goose
alex
what
do
you
want
her
for
oh
nothing
alex
replied
dejectedly
and
also
very
crossly
she
was
in
the
frame
of
mind
that
seeks
a
grievance
and
her
nerves
were
far
more
overstrained
than
she
realized
she
felt
a
sudden
absolute
anger
when
noel
said
didactically
i
do
think
it
would
be
very
good
manners
for
me
to
go
and
force
myself
on
goldstein
notice
i
do
know
her
at
all
well
and
there
are
heaps
of
people
who
want
to
talk
to
her
just
look
at
all
those
fellows
you
might
do
it
just
to
please
me
muttered
alex
less
from
coquettery
than
from
injured
pride
noel
became
rather
red
and
after
a
minute
he
remarked
in
a
severe
voice
i
must
say
alex
i
think
that
rather
a
ridiculous
thing
to
say
alex
was
silent
but
from
that
day
the
spirit
of
resentment
had
at
last
awakened
within
her
she
became
irritable
and
although
she
still
strove
to
persuade
herself
that
her
engagement
meant
the
ultimate
realization
of
happiness
she
often
spoke
impatiently
to
noel
and
no
longer
sought
to
conform
herself
to
the
type
of
womanhood
which
he
obviously
desired
and
expected
to
find
her
the
old
sense
of
waiting
for
the
next
thing
was
strong
upon
her
and
she
spent
her
days
in
desultory
idleness
since
lady
isabel
made
fewer
engagements
for
her
and
noel
calls
upon
her
time
were
far
from
excessive
she
made
the
discovery
then
less
illuminating
at
the
time
than
when
viewed
afterwards
in
retrospect
that
she
could
not
bear
to
read
novels
all
of
them
sooner
or
later
seemed
to
deal
with
the
relations
between
a
man
and
a
woman
in
love
and
alex
found
herself
reading
of
emotions
and
experiences
of
which
her
own
seemed
so
feeble
a
mockery
that
she
was
conscious
of
a
physical
pang
of
sick
disappointment
was
all
fiction
utterly
untrue
to
life
or
was
hers
the
counterfeit
while
the
printed
pages
but
reproduced
something
of
a
reality
which
was
denied
to
her
she
dared
not
face
the
question
and
was
further
perplexed
by
the
axiom
mechanically
passed
on
by
successive
authorities
in
rebuke
of
her
childhood
passion
for
reading
you
ca
learn
anything
about
real
life
from
at
all
events
alex
found
the
of
no
solace
to
her
mental
sickness
and
turned
away
from
their
perusal
with
a
sinking
heart
she
seldom
quarrelled
with
noel
because
although
he
was
sometimes
unmistakably
offended
at
her
petulance
he
never
lost
his
temper
on
the
contrary
he
argued
with
her
at
such
length
that
alex
although
the
arguments
left
her
quite
unconvinced
of
the
tightness
of
his
point
of
view
often
gave
in
from
sheer
weariness
and
the
sense
of
hopeless
exhausting
muddle
she
could
visualize
no
possible
eventual
solution
of
the
intangible
problem
that
somewhere
lay
heavy
undefined
and
undefinable
at
the
back
of
all
her
thoughts
it
seemed
to
her
that
such
a
state
of
affairs
had
endured
for
a
lifetime
and
must
extend
into
eternity
when
her
relations
with
noel
entered
into
the
inevitable
crisis
to
which
a
fortnight
mutual
fret
and
dissatisfaction
had
been
only
the
prelude
sir
francis
graciously
benevolent
invited
noel
cardew
to
make
one
of
an
annual
gathering
that
for
the
clare
children
amounted
to
an
institution
to
view
the
christmas
pantomime
at
drury
lane
for
more
years
than
any
of
them
except
alex
could
remember
a
box
at
the
pantomime
had
been
the
yearly
almost
the
solitary
expression
of
sir
francis
clare
recognition
of
his
younger
children
existence
as
beings
other
than
merely
ornamental
adjuncts
to
their
mother
lady
isabel
who
detested
pantomimes
never
joined
the
party
and
alex
could
remember
still
had
indeed
never
altogether
lost
the
feeling
of
extreme
awe
that
rendered
unnecessary
old
nurse
severe
injunctions
to
the
children
as
to
the
behaviour
suitable
to
so
great
an
occasion
this
year
barbara
was
at
neuilly
and
it
was
considered
inadvisable
to
unsettle
her
by
a
return
to
london
for
the
christmas
holidays
but
cedric
was
at
home
and
archie
and
pamela
as
clamorous
as
they
dared
to
be
for
their
father
treat
sir
francis
did
not
sacrifice
himself
to
the
extent
of
foregoing
late
dinner
altogether
but
he
dined
at
seven
and
issued
what
more
nearly
approached
to
a
royal
mandate
than
an
invitation
to
alex
cedric
and
noel
to
bear
him
company
the
big
cuckoo
clock
in
the
hall
still
showed
the
hour
as
short
of
eight
when
pamela
and
archie
the
former
muffled
in
a
large
pink
shawl
and
both
of
them
prancing
with
impatience
were
at
last
permitted
to
dispatch
the
footman
in
search
of
a
cab
the
carriage
in
the
opinion
of
sir
francis
would
be
amply
filled
by
himself
his
two
daughters
and
noel
cardew
and
it
was
part
of
the
procedure
that
the
boys
should
be
allowed
to
journey
to
the
theatre
by
themselves
in
a
the
streets
were
snowy
and
as
shafts
of
light
from
the
fell
across
the
crowded
pavements
and
brilliant
shop
windows
still
displaying
the
christmas
decorations
put
up
a
month
ago
something
of
the
old
childish
glamour
surrounding
the
yearly
festival
came
upon
alex
pamela
already
a
modern
child
in
the
lack
of
that
awe
of
their
father
that
had
kept
alex
and
barbara
in
his
presence
nevertheless
had
none
of
the
modern
child
satiety
of
parties
and
entertainments
of
all
kinds
the
drury
lane
pantomime
was
her
solitary
annual
experience
of
the
theatre
and
she
was
proportionately
prepared
to
enjoy
herself
to
the
full
when
sir
francis
with
kind
unhumorous
smile
made
pretence
of
having
forgotten
the
tickets
pamela
gave
alex
a
shock
by
her
cheerful
and
unhesitating
refusal
to
carry
on
the
dutiful
tradition
of
her
elder
sisters
and
conform
tacitly
to
the
jest
by
a
display
of
pretended
consternation
oh
no
i
know
you
have
forgotten
them
pamela
cried
shrilly
i
saw
you
look
at
them
just
before
we
started
besides
you
said
last
year
you
forgotten
them
and
you
had
them
in
your
pocket
all
the
time
i
remember
quite
well
she
began
to
bounce
up
and
down
on
the
seat
of
the
carriage
the
skirts
of
her
new
pink
frock
billowing
round
her
sit
still
said
alex
repressively
she
reflected
that
she
herself
as
a
little
girl
and
even
barbara
had
been
very
much
nicer
than
was
pamela
she
wondered
what
noel
had
been
like
as
a
little
boy
and
looked
at
him
almost
involuntarily
his
glance
met
hers
and
he
smiled
slightly
the
response
touched
alex
suddenly
and
acutely
and
she
felt
a
pang
of
remorse
for
the
intense
irritation
that
his
presence
had
often
caused
her
lately
when
the
carriage
stopped
and
he
sprang
out
to
offer
her
his
hand
in
descending
she
gave
hers
to
him
with
a
tiny
thrill
and
her
fingers
lingered
for
an
instant
in
his
as
though
awaiting
almost
in
spite
of
herself
an
pressure
that
was
not
forthcoming
it
begun
gasped
pamela
in
an
agony
of
impatience
in
the
sir
francis
always
punctilious
placed
alex
in
the
corner
of
the
box
the
two
children
in
the
centre
and
then
with
a
slight
smile
offered
noel
his
choice
of
the
remaining
chairs
alex
was
conscious
of
a
throb
of
gratification
perhaps
more
attributable
to
vanity
than
to
anything
else
when
the
young
man
placed
himself
just
behind
her
own
chair
sir
francis
the
comparative
isolation
of
the
engaged
couple
sufficiently
sanctioned
by
the
family
party
surrounding
them
immediately
disposed
himself
behind
cedric
at
the
extreme
left
of
the
box
the
curtain
went
down
to
the
sound
of
applause
almost
as
they
took
their
places
and
the
lights
were
turned
up
alex
looked
round
her
the
huge
house
was
everywhere
sprinkled
with
groups
of
children
eton
boys
in
broad
white
collars
such
as
archie
wore
little
girls
in
white
frocks
with
wide
pink
or
blue
sashes
and
when
the
orchestra
began
a
medley
of
popular
airs
sweet
home
way
down
upon
the
swanee
river
bluebells
of
and
the
like
alex
overwrought
fell
an
easy
victim
to
the
cheap
appeal
to
emotionalism
in
the
irrational
passionate
desire
for
reassurance
that
fell
upon
her
she
leant
back
until
her
shoulder
almost
touched
noel
look
at
all
those
children
she
whispered
hardly
knowing
what
she
said
noel
gazed
at
the
stalls
through
his
the
place
is
crammed
he
said
they
say
it
the
best
show
ever
had
of
course
i
have
seen
it
yet
but
my
own
idea
about
these
pantomimes
is
that
they
do
stick
enough
to
the
original
story
take
now
or
babes
in
the
wood
the
whole
thing
is
simply
a
mass
of
interpolations
they
never
really
follow
the
thread
of
one
idea
all
the
way
through
i
ca
help
thinking
it
would
be
much
better
if
they
did
you
know
after
all
a
pantomime
is
supposed
to
be
for
children
is
it
yes
alex
wondered
what
reply
she
had
expected
from
him
to
her
sudden
ejaculation
that
the
actuality
should
bring
such
a
sense
of
ironical
disappointment
she
leant
forward
again
as
the
curtain
went
up
she
was
still
child
enough
to
enjoy
a
pantomime
for
its
own
sake
but
the
swing
of
catchy
tunes
and
sentimental
ballads
brought
with
them
something
more
than
the
easy
heartache
to
which
youth
falls
so
ready
a
victim
as
the
crash
of
the
orchestra
heralded
a
big
scenic
effect
of
dance
and
colour
noel
leant
a
little
towards
her
and
began
to
speak
of
course
it
a
good
show
in
its
way
look
alex
you
can
see
the
man
manipulating
the
coloured
lights
up
there
if
you
lean
right
back
into
this
corner
there
up
there
his
voice
was
full
of
interest
and
almost
of
eagerness
alex
leant
back
as
he
suggested
and
gazed
obediently
up
at
the
operator
although
she
felt
no
interest
but
rather
a
faint
distaste
it
the
ingenuity
of
these
things
i
like
noel
voice
in
her
ear
was
explaining
of
course
the
dancing
good
and
the
comic
bits
though
i
do
know
that
i
care
tremendously
about
that
they
always
apt
to
be
rather
vulgar
even
in
front
of
a
lot
of
ladies
and
children
pity
that
is
but
take
the
songs
now
alex
would
you
think
that
it
would
pay
some
one
to
write
really
libretto
and
get
it
taken
on
at
a
place
like
this
and
set
to
decent
music
the
tunes
are
good
enough
but
the
words
that
are
so
poor
i
always
think
alex
listened
almost
without
hearing
the
time
had
gone
by
when
she
could
tell
herself
with
vehement
attempt
at
that
such
assertions
indicated
a
fundamental
resemblance
between
her
tastes
and
those
of
noel
cardew
she
was
now
only
unreasonably
angry
and
disappointed
because
of
her
baffled
desire
for
the
introduction
however
belated
of
a
personal
element
into
their
intercourse
she
actually
felt
the
tears
rising
to
her
throat
as
the
evening
wore
on
and
an
intolerable
fatigue
overcame
her
sitting
upright
became
more
and
more
of
an
effort
and
the
box
seemed
narrow
and
the
instinct
of
made
her
attempt
to
draw
noel
sympathy
indirectly
could
you
move
back
a
little
she
half
whispered
i
am
getting
rather
cramped
are
you
returned
noel
with
surprise
as
he
pushed
his
chair
back
but
he
did
not
appear
to
be
in
the
least
concerned
about
the
matter
she
looked
at
him
once
or
twice
and
he
met
her
glance
absently
she
knew
that
her
face
must
show
signs
of
the
fatigue
that
she
felt
but
she
knew
also
that
they
would
not
be
perceptible
to
noel
for
a
moment
one
of
the
rebellious
gusts
of
misery
of
her
stormy
childhood
shook
alex
why
should
there
be
no
one
to
care
no
one
to
whom
it
mattered
that
she
be
weary
or
out
of
spirits
no
one
to
perceive
unprompted
when
she
was
tired
she
realized
what
such
instinctive
protection
and
care
would
mean
to
her
and
the
almost
passionate
gratitude
with
which
she
could
welcome
and
return
such
solicitude
but
with
noel
she
need
not
even
exercise
it
had
she
loved
him
as
she
had
endeavoured
to
persuade
herself
that
she
did
instead
of
only
the
figure
of
love
called
by
his
name
alex
knew
that
noel
would
have
passed
by
all
the
smaller
manifestations
of
her
love
unheeding
and
uncomprehending
her
gods
were
mocking
her
with
counterfeit
indeed
you
look
tired
alex
said
her
father
voice
alex
knew
that
on
the
rare
occasions
when
he
personally
supervised
a
party
of
pleasure
sir
francis
liked
the
occasion
to
be
met
with
due
appreciation
she
gave
a
forced
smile
and
sat
rather
more
upright
to
be
sure
her
father
said
seriously
it
is
a
prolonged
entertainment
but
alex
knew
that
neither
cedric
archie
nor
pamela
would
hear
of
any
curtailment
of
their
enjoyment
and
pamela
was
already
urgently
whispering
that
they
stay
for
the
clown
they
always
did
sir
francis
yielded
graciously
evidently
and
they
remained
in
the
theatre
for
the
final
humours
of
the
harlequinade
snow
was
actually
falling
when
at
length
sir
francis
clare
carriage
was
discovered
and
alex
her
always
low
vitality
at
its
lowest
was
shivering
with
mingled
cold
and
fatigue
get
in
children
commanded
their
father
noel
my
dear
boy
we
can
give
you
a
lift
but
pray
get
in
we
must
not
keep
the
horses
standing
what
a
terrible
night
crouched
into
a
corner
of
the
carriage
with
pamela
half
asleep
on
her
lap
alex
was
conscious
of
the
relief
of
the
darkness
and
the
swift
motion
of
the
wheels
noel
was
next
her
and
in
the
sudden
sense
of
almost
childish
terror
and
loneliness
that
possessed
her
alex
sought
instinctive
comfort
and
reassurance
in
the
unavoidable
contact
she
leant
against
his
shoulder
in
the
shelter
of
the
dark
carriage
and
was
sorry
when
clevedon
square
was
reached
at
last
and
she
found
herself
obliged
to
descend
thanks
most
awfully
said
noel
at
the
door
alex
i
say
i
afraid
you
were
frightfully
jammed
up
in
the
corner
there
i
so
sorry
but
i
simply
could
move
xiii
decision
on
making
up
her
mind
that
she
must
break
off
her
engagement
alex
unaware
took
the
bravest
decision
of
her
life
she
was
being
true
to
an
instinctive
standard
in
which
she
herself
only
believed
with
part
of
her
mind
and
which
was
absolutely
unknown
to
any
of
those
who
made
up
her
surroundings
she
hardly
knew
however
that
she
had
taken
any
resolution
in
her
many
wakeful
nights
and
discontented
days
until
the
moment
when
she
actually
put
it
into
execution
she
wrote
no
eloquent
letter
entered
into
no
elaborate
explanation
such
as
would
have
seemed
to
her
after
the
manner
of
her
generation
theoretically
indispensable
to
the
situation
she
blurted
out
three
bald
words
which
struck
upon
her
own
hearing
with
a
sense
of
extreme
shock
the
moment
they
were
uttered
it
no
use
noel
looked
hard
at
her
for
a
moment
and
then
did
not
pretend
to
misunderstand
her
meaning
what
us
being
engaged
his
intuitive
comprehension
of
which
alex
had
received
so
little
proof
ever
before
might
be
unflattering
but
it
struck
her
with
immense
relief
yes
they
gazed
at
each
other
in
silence
for
a
few
moments
and
alex
was
furious
with
herself
for
a
phrase
sprung
from
nowhere
that
reiterated
itself
in
her
brain
as
she
looked
at
noel
handsome
inexpressive
face
and
again
and
again
they
were
in
the
at
clevedon
square
and
noel
as
though
seeking
to
relieve
his
obvious
embarrassment
by
moving
got
up
and
walked
across
the
room
to
the
window
of
course
i
felt
for
some
time
that
you
were
very
happy
about
it
all
and
naturally
if
you
feel
like
that
all
the
seething
disappointment
and
wounded
vanity
and
aching
loneliness
that
had
tortured
her
since
the
very
first
moments
of
her
engagement
to
noel
cardew
rushed
back
on
alex
but
she
sought
vainly
for
words
in
which
to
convey
any
part
of
her
feelings
to
him
it
would
be
like
trying
to
explain
some
abstruse
principle
of
science
to
a
little
child
the
sense
of
the
utter
uselessness
of
any
attempt
at
making
clear
to
him
the
reasons
which
were
chaotic
even
to
herself
paralysed
alex
utterance
i
do
think
it
any
use
going
on
she
repeated
feebly
you
perfectly
free
noel
assured
her
scrupulously
and
though
of
course
i
i
i
you
we
it
would
be
he
broke
off
very
red
alex
wished
vaguely
that
it
was
possible
for
them
to
talk
it
all
out
quite
frankly
and
dispassionately
with
one
another
but
the
hard
crystalline
detachment
of
the
generation
that
was
to
follow
theirs
had
as
yet
no
place
in
the
scheme
of
things
known
to
noel
and
alex
they
made
awkward
conventional
phrases
to
one
another
naturally
the
boy
said
with
an
effort
the
whole
blame
must
rest
with
me
oh
no
i
tell
father
and
mother
that
i
wanted
to
to
break
it
off
alex
stopped
conscious
that
she
could
not
think
of
anything
else
to
say
but
rather
to
her
surprise
it
appeared
that
noel
had
something
else
to
say
he
faced
her
with
hands
thrust
into
his
pockets
his
hair
and
little
fair
moustache
and
his
brown
eyes
looking
very
light
indeed
contrasted
with
his
flushed
face
of
course
you
absolutely
free
as
i
said
only
i
must
say
alex
that
you
making
rather
a
mistake
every
one
was
awfully
pleased
about
it
and
we
known
each
other
since
we
were
kids
since
were
a
kid
at
any
rate
and
a
broken
engagement
well
of
course
i
do
want
to
say
anything
naturally
but
it
put
a
girl
in
a
a
well
in
what
called
rather
an
invidious
position
especially
when
it
is
as
though
there
was
any
particular
reason
for
it
the
principal
reason
alex
began
faintly
not
altogether
certain
of
what
it
was
that
she
was
about
to
say
you
see
i
always
thought
we
should
hit
it
off
together
so
well
we
always
did
as
kids
when
you
were
a
kid
i
mean
noel
explained
we
always
seemed
to
like
the
same
things
and
have
a
good
deal
in
common
i
do
think
that
you
liked
any
of
the
things
cared
about
especially
alex
said
with
a
flash
of
spirit
what
does
that
matter
noel
demanded
naïvely
so
long
as
one
of
us
likes
the
things
that
the
other
does
it
would
be
exactly
the
same
thing
alex
had
never
told
herself
and
was
therefore
quite
unable
to
tell
noel
that
she
had
never
liked
anything
particularly
except
his
liking
for
her
which
she
had
striven
almost
frenziedly
to
gain
and
retain
by
means
of
an
display
of
sympathetic
interest
in
his
enthusiasms
there
another
thing
i
do
know
whether
i
ought
to
say
it
to
you
quite
but
of
course
after
one
well
married
there
a
lot
more
one
has
in
common
naturally
yes
said
alex
forlornly
she
quite
believed
it
there
was
an
awkward
silence
are
you
angry
noel
she
did
not
think
he
was
at
all
angry
or
very
violently
moved
in
any
way
but
she
asked
the
question
from
an
instinctive
desire
to
hear
from
him
any
expression
of
his
real
feelings
he
replied
stiffly
not
at
all
of
course
it
much
better
that
you
should
say
all
this
in
time
as
i
say
i
felt
for
some
time
that
you
were
particularly
cheerful
but
i
must
say
alex
i
dashed
if
i
know
why
i
do
know
why
exactly
except
that
i
i
do
feel
as
if
we
really
cared
enough
for
one
another
alex
spoke
with
a
pause
between
each
word
blushing
scarlet
as
though
it
really
cost
her
a
physical
effort
to
break
through
the
barrier
of
reserve
that
she
had
been
taught
so
relentlessly
should
always
be
erected
between
her
own
soul
and
the
naked
truth
of
her
own
sensations
and
intimate
convictions
noel
blushed
too
and
alex
felt
that
he
was
shocked
which
increased
her
own
almost
unbearably
naturally
if
i
had
he
left
a
blank
to
supply
the
words
i
should
have
asked
you
to
be
engaged
to
me
i
must
say
alex
i
think
you
rather
exacting
you
know
alex
quivered
from
head
to
foot
as
though
he
had
insulted
her
most
brutally
she
who
had
shrunk
with
a
genuine
dread
that
had
surprised
herself
from
noel
few
endearments
and
had
found
so
entire
a
lack
of
response
in
herself
to
his
displays
of
tenderness
to
be
accused
of
having
been
exacting
she
did
not
for
an
instant
realize
what
even
noel
faintly
surmised
that
she
had
indeed
been
exacting
of
a
romantic
fervour
which
she
was
as
incapable
inspiring
as
he
of
bestowing
from
which
had
it
existed
the
outward
expressions
of
love
would
have
leapt
spontaneously
supremely
appropriate
and
necessary
to
them
both
in
the
mental
chaos
and
muddle
of
their
extreme
youth
they
looked
at
one
another
confused
and
bewildered
almost
like
two
children
suddenly
conscious
of
the
magnitude
of
their
own
naughtiness
noel
said
rather
proudly
as
though
one
of
the
children
suddenly
tried
to
appear
you
must
allow
me
to
undertake
the
distressing
task
of
breaking
it
to
alex
almost
shuddered
so
acute
was
her
own
apprehension
of
the
disclosure
to
her
father
and
mother
i
shall
tell
mother
at
once
she
said
lacking
the
courage
even
to
mention
sir
francis
it
was
typical
of
the
whole
time
and
circumstances
of
their
brief
engagement
that
both
noel
and
in
a
lesser
degree
alex
had
looked
upon
the
relation
into
which
they
had
entered
as
one
in
which
their
parents
held
the
stakes
and
were
of
primary
concern
they
themselves
were
only
puppets
for
whom
strings
were
pulled
so
as
to
cause
certain
vibrations
and
reactions
over
which
they
had
no
personal
control
this
belief
unformulated
by
either
and
entirely
characteristic
of
a
late
victorian
generation
was
perhaps
that
which
they
held
most
in
common
alex
even
wondered
whether
she
ought
to
wait
and
speak
to
lady
isabel
before
taking
the
next
step
which
she
had
in
mind
but
her
desire
to
try
and
raise
their
trivial
shamefaced
parting
to
a
higher
level
by
one
dramatic
touch
was
too
strong
for
her
she
slowly
pulled
the
diamond
off
her
finger
and
handed
it
to
him
oh
i
say
stammered
noel
he
looked
miserably
undecided
and
she
knew
that
he
was
wondering
whether
he
could
not
ask
her
to
keep
it
just
the
same
but
in
the
end
he
slipped
it
into
his
pocket
after
balancing
it
undecidedly
for
a
moment
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
she
sat
on
the
sofa
her
left
hand
feeling
strangely
bare
unweighted
by
the
heavy
glittering
hoop
and
noel
looked
out
of
the
window
i
think
i
shall
go
abroad
he
announced
suddenly
and
with
mingled
relief
and
mortification
alex
detected
the
sound
of
satisfaction
latent
in
his
voice
she
felt
that
he
thought
himself
to
be
doing
the
proper
thing
in
the
circumstances
and
the
sting
inflicted
on
her
pride
by
his
acquiescence
in
their
parting
though
she
had
expected
nothing
else
gave
her
the
sudden
impulse
necessary
to
rise
and
cross
the
room
until
she
stood
beside
him
at
the
window
please
forgive
me
noel
oh
there
nothing
to
forgive
he
returned
hastily
of
course
if
you
feel
like
that
it
all
over
he
looked
at
her
steadily
and
alex
felt
the
suspicion
rush
over
her
that
he
was
trying
obliquely
to
convey
a
warning
to
her
that
if
she
dismissed
him
now
it
would
be
of
no
use
to
recall
him
later
alex
felt
passionately
that
in
the
depths
of
his
stubborn
vanity
lay
the
truest
presentment
of
himself
that
noel
would
ever
show
her
if
there
was
another
side
to
his
personality
and
she
was
dimly
willing
to
believe
it
for
all
her
utter
ignorance
of
him
the
power
to
call
it
forth
did
not
dwell
in
her
her
momentary
feeling
of
anger
gave
way
to
humiliation
and
she
half
held
out
her
hand
noel
she
said
humbly
as
though
to
atone
for
the
lack
of
feeling
in
his
tone
noel
wrung
her
hand
until
it
hurt
her
as
he
replied
automatically
alex
i
suppose
we
shall
never
meet
again
thought
alex
with
all
the
finality
of
youth
and
felt
dazed
as
she
saw
him
open
the
door
mechanically
she
rang
the
bell
in
order
that
the
servants
downstairs
might
know
that
he
was
leaving
and
come
into
the
hall
to
find
his
hat
and
stick
and
to
open
the
door
for
him
lady
isabel
had
instilled
into
alex
that
it
was
part
of
her
responsibility
in
life
to
ring
the
bell
for
departing
guests
as
unostentatiously
as
possible
at
just
the
right
moment
and
every
time
that
she
remembered
to
do
it
she
always
felt
rather
proud
of
herself
this
time
she
thought
it
the
last
time
noel
will
ever
be
in
this
room
with
me
he
is
going
right
out
of
my
life
she
was
quite
unconsciously
trying
to
awaken
in
herself
an
anguish
of
regret
that
might
yet
justify
her
to
herself
in
recalling
her
lover
if
he
turns
round
at
the
door
and
says
alex
she
tried
to
cheat
herself
with
a
hope
that
was
yet
not
a
hope
noel
turned
at
the
door
in
a
solemn
magnanimous
voice
he
said
alex
i
do
want
you
to
feel
ever
that
you
need
reproach
yourself
whatever
any
one
may
say
remember
that
if
he
suddenly
looked
like
a
rather
frightened
little
boy
if
there
a
great
fuss
then
the
door
closed
very
quietly
behind
him
and
alex
heard
him
go
downstairs
slowly
it
seemed
to
her
that
noel
farewell
had
plumbed
the
final
depth
of
his
inadequacy
presently
she
sank
into
an
armchair
before
the
fire
and
tried
to
visualize
the
effects
of
her
own
action
she
was
principally
conscious
of
a
certain
amazement
that
a
step
which
seemed
likely
to
have
such
consequences
should
have
been
so
largely
the
result
of
sudden
impulse
she
had
not
thought
the
night
before
of
breaking
off
her
engagement
it
had
all
happened
very
quickly
in
a
few
minutes
when
the
sense
of
tension
which
had
hung
round
her
intercourse
with
noel
had
suddenly
seemed
to
reach
an
unbearable
pitch
so
that
something
had
snapped
was
this
how
important
things
happened
to
one
through
life
alex
felt
that
she
could
not
believe
it
but
a
broken
engagement
could
there
be
anything
more
important
more
desperate
alex
felt
with
melancholy
satisfaction
that
at
least
it
was
real
life
as
she
had
always
imagined
it
full
of
drama
and
tragedy
with
of
course
a
glory
of
happiness
as
final
climax
that
would
make
up
for
everything
more
physically
tired
than
she
knew
alex
abandoned
herself
dreamily
to
the
old
idle
visions
of
the
wonderful
perfect
love
that
should
come
to
crown
her
life
there
was
no
faint
latent
sense
of
disloyalty
to
noel
now
in
returning
to
her
old
dreams
that
had
been
hers
in
one
form
or
another
ever
since
her
childish
ideal
of
a
perfect
friend
who
would
always
understand
and
yet
love
one
just
the
same
it
was
with
a
violent
start
that
alex
came
back
to
reality
again
she
had
dismissed
noel
cardew
had
given
him
back
his
beautiful
diamond
and
now
she
would
have
to
tell
her
father
and
mother
with
no
better
reason
to
adduce
than
her
own
caprice
she
felt
sick
with
fright
she
remembered
sir
francis
silent
but
unmistakable
pride
and
pleasure
in
his
engaged
daughter
and
lady
isabel
additional
display
of
affection
and
even
of
deference
to
alex
taste
in
choosing
her
frocks
and
hats
and
her
own
sense
of
having
at
last
atoned
to
them
both
for
her
unsatisfactory
childhood
and
lack
of
any
conspicuous
social
success
such
as
they
had
coveted
for
her
alex
cowering
in
her
chair
now
wondered
how
she
could
face
them
her
only
shred
of
comfort
lay
in
the
remembrance
that
lady
isabel
had
said
to
her
my
darlin
i
so
thankful
to
know
you
are
marrying
for
love
alex
in
bitter
bewilderment
remembered
those
words
again
and
again
in
the
days
which
followed
no
one
reproached
her
she
heard
hardly
a
word
of
blame
and
the
most
severe
censure
spoken
to
her
was
in
her
mother
soft
voice
far
more
distressed
than
angry
but
alex
do
you
know
what
people
say
about
a
girl
who
behaved
as
you
have
that
she
a
vulgar
neither
more
nor
less
to
throw
over
a
young
man
after
being
engaged
to
him
for
four
weeks
with
no
reason
except
a
capricious
fit
oh
my
darling
could
you
have
asked
me
first
to
go
and
give
him
back
that
lovely
ring
and
hurt
and
insult
him
of
course
he
never
come
back
your
father
says
how
well
he
behaved
poor
boy
alex
alex
what
shall
i
do
with
you
tears
were
running
down
her
pretty
face
so
slightly
lined
even
now
alex
cried
too
from
pity
for
her
mother
and
wretched
undefined
remorse
and
a
growing
conviction
that
in
acting
on
her
own
distorted
impulse
she
had
once
more
involved
herself
and
far
worse
others
in
and
disastrous
consequences
thank
heaven
we
had
announced
the
engagement
but
of
course
it
will
all
get
about
things
always
do
and
there
nothing
worse
for
a
girl
than
to
get
that
sort
of
reputation
especially
when
she
not
not
tremendously
sought
after
or
pretty
or
anything
lady
isabel
had
never
before
come
so
near
to
an
avowal
that
her
eldest
daughter
career
had
proved
a
disappointment
to
her
and
alex
in
the
admission
rightly
gauged
the
extent
of
her
mother
dismay
why
did
you
do
it
alex
alex
tried
haltingly
to
explain
but
she
could
only
say
i
i
felt
i
did
care
for
him
enough
but
you
had
had
time
to
find
out
you
accepted
him
when
he
proposed
so
you
must
have
been
quite
ready
to
like
him
then
and
you
only
been
engaged
for
four
weeks
how
could
you
tell
a
little
thing
like
you
wailed
lady
isabel
oh
alex
if
you
only
come
to
me
about
it
first
i
could
have
explained
it
all
to
you
girls
often
get
fancies
about
being
in
love
i
thought
you
wanted
me
to
marry
for
love
you
said
so
sobbed
alex
of
course
i
do
want
you
to
marry
without
it
but
it
the
love
that
comes
marriage
that
really
counts
and
a
boy
you
known
all
your
life
practically
that
we
all
liked
you
could
have
been
ideally
happy
alex
lady
isabel
looked
at
her
almost
resentfully
i
do
know
what
will
happen
to
you
my
darling
i
do
indeed
i
sometimes
think
you
are
just
as
headstrong
and
exaggerated
as
when
you
were
a
little
girl
and
alex
i
do
like
even
to
say
such
a
thing
to
you
but
there
never
been
any
one
noel
and
i
afraid
this
is
the
sort
of
thing
that
makes
any
man
nothing
puts
them
off
more
and
no
wonder
alex
thought
momentarily
of
queenie
but
she
knew
that
was
different
in
the
supreme
object
of
woman
to
attract
queenie
stood
in
a
class
apart
nothing
that
queenie
could
ever
do
would
ever
rob
her
of
the
devotion
that
was
hers
wherever
she
chose
to
claim
it
by
mysterious
right
of
attraction
from
her
father
alex
heard
very
little
she
was
left
in
her
abnormal
sensitiveness
to
measure
his
disappointment
and
mortification
by
his
very
silence
feeling
again
like
the
naughty
little
girl
who
had
been
responsible
for
barbara
fall
from
the
balusters
and
had
been
sent
to
sir
francis
for
sentence
she
listened
in
a
silence
that
was
broken
only
by
the
sobs
that
she
could
hardly
control
to
his
few
measured
utterances
you
are
old
enough
to
know
your
own
mind
sir
francis
paused
swinging
his
glasses
lightly
to
and
fro
in
his
hand
then
he
deliberately
put
them
across
his
nose
and
looked
at
her
at
least
he
added
carefully
i
suppose
you
are
your
mother
tells
me
that
you
appear
to
have
been
er
rather
suddenly
overwhelmed
by
a
fear
of
marrying
without
love
i
do
wish
to
say
alex
that
such
a
sentiment
was
not
more
or
less
proper
and
natural
but
to
act
upon
it
so
hastily
and
with
such
a
heartless
lack
of
consideration
appears
to
me
to
be
the
action
my
dear
child
sir
francis
paused
and
then
added
calmly
of
a
fool
the
word
is
not
a
pretty
one
but
i
prefer
it
to
the
only
other
alternative
that
i
can
see
for
describing
your
conduct
have
you
anything
to
say
my
dear
alex
had
nothing
to
say
and
would
in
any
case
have
been
rendered
by
this
time
powerless
of
saying
it
sir
francis
looked
at
her
with
the
same
grief
and
mortification
on
his
handsome
severe
face
that
had
been
there
eight
years
before
when
the
nursery
termagant
sobbing
and
terrified
had
stood
before
him
in
her
short
frock
and
pinafore
you
could
have
asked
advice
he
said
gently
you
have
parents
whose
only
wish
is
to
see
you
happy
why
did
you
not
go
to
your
mother
alex
tried
to
say
because
but
found
that
the
only
reason
which
presented
itself
to
her
mind
was
her
own
conviction
that
lady
isabel
would
not
have
understood
and
she
dared
not
speak
it
aloud
the
claire
axiom
as
that
of
thousands
of
their
class
and
generation
was
that
parents
by
divine
right
knew
more
than
their
children
could
ever
hope
to
learn
and
that
nothing
within
the
ken
of
these
could
ever
prove
beyond
their
comprehension
sir
francis
shook
his
head
sadly
i
will
tell
you
my
poor
child
since
you
will
not
answer
me
why
you
did
not
seek
your
mother
advice
it
was
because
you
are
weakly
impulsive
and
by
one
act
of
impetuous
folly
will
lay
up
for
yourself
years
of
unavailing
remorse
and
regret
alex
recognized
with
something
like
terror
the
truth
of
his
description
weakly
impulsive
she
had
blindly
followed
an
instinct
and
as
usual
all
her
world
had
blamed
her
and
she
had
found
herself
faced
by
consequences
that
appalled
her
why
must
one
always
involve
others
she
ceased
to
see
clearly
that
marriage
with
noel
cardew
would
have
meant
misery
and
blindly
accepted
the
vision
thrust
upon
her
by
her
surroundings
she
had
hurt
and
disappointed
and
shamed
them
and
they
could
only
see
her
action
as
a
cruel
capricious
impulse
alex
weakly
impulsive
as
sir
francis
had
said
and
sick
with
misery
at
their
unspoken
blame
and
silent
disappointment
presently
lost
her
always
feeble
hold
of
her
own
convictions
and
saw
with
their
eyes
xiv
barbara
alex
became
more
and
more
unhappy
it
was
evident
that
lady
isabel
felt
hardly
any
pleasure
now
in
taking
her
daughter
about
with
her
and
the
consciousness
of
not
being
approved
rendered
alex
more
and
less
sure
of
herself
than
ever
it
was
inevitable
that
one
or
two
of
her
mother
more
intimate
friends
should
know
of
her
affair
with
noel
cardew
and
it
did
not
need
lady
isabel
occasional
sorrowful
comments
to
persuade
alex
that
they
took
the
same
view
of
her
conduct
as
did
her
parents
the
sense
of
being
despised
overwhelmed
her
and
she
fretted
secretly
and
lost
some
of
her
colour
and
held
herself
worse
than
ever
from
the
lassitude
that
overwhelmed
her
physically
whenever
she
was
bored
or
unhappy
towards
easter
lady
isabel
sent
for
barbara
to
come
home
from
neuilly
alex
revived
a
little
at
the
idea
of
having
barbara
at
clevedon
square
again
she
thought
it
would
impress
her
younger
still
schoolgirl
sister
to
see
her
as
a
person
and
she
could
not
help
hoping
that
barbara
promoted
to
being
a
confidante
would
thrill
at
the
story
of
a
real
love
affair
and
a
broken
engagement
alex
was
prepared
to
attribute
to
noel
a
romantic
despair
that
had
not
been
his
at
her
ruthless
dismissal
of
him
in
order
to
overawe
little
barbara
but
behold
barbara
after
those
months
spent
in
the
household
of
the
marquise
de
métrancourt
de
la
hautefeuille
no
need
to
tell
to
keep
her
shoulders
back
she
was
not
quite
so
tall
as
alex
but
her
slim
figure
was
exquisitely
upright
encased
in
french
stays
that
made
even
lady
isabel
gasp
she
wore
with
an
air
astonishing
french
clothes
that
swung
gracefully
round
her
as
she
moved
and
her
hair
which
had
developed
a
surprising
ripple
was
gathered
up
at
the
back
of
her
head
with
a
huge
outstanding
bow
of
ribbon
that
seemed
to
form
a
background
for
the
pale
pointed
little
face
that
was
still
barbara
but
had
somehow
acquired
an
elusive
charm
that
actually
seemed
more
distinguished
than
ordinary
healthy
english
prettiness
and
the
of
the
child
alex
was
disgusted
at
the
ease
with
which
barbara
hitherto
shy
and
in
the
presence
of
her
parents
chattered
lightly
to
them
on
the
evening
of
her
return
and
offered
actually
offered
unasked
to
sing
them
some
of
her
new
songs
new
songs
indeed
when
it
was
only
a
year
ago
that
she
had
written
to
ask
whether
she
might
have
a
few
singing
lessons
with
the
marquise
daughter
but
neither
sir
francis
nor
lady
isabel
rebuked
her
temerity
and
they
even
exchanged
amused
approving
glances
when
the
slim
upright
figure
moved
lightly
across
the
room
to
the
big
grand
piano
alex
in
her
pink
evening
dress
with
her
hair
felt
infinitely
childish
and
awkward
as
she
watched
barbara
slip
off
a
new
gold
bangle
from
her
little
white
rounded
wrist
and
strike
a
couple
of
chords
with
perfect
she
was
going
to
play
without
music
it
was
absurd
barbara
had
never
been
musical
certainly
the
voice
in
which
she
sang
a
couple
of
little
french
was
a
very
tiny
one
but
there
was
a
tunefulness
above
all
a
vivacity
about
her
whole
performance
which
caused
even
sir
francis
to
break
into
unwonted
applause
at
the
finish
alex
applauded
too
principally
from
the
desire
to
prove
to
herself
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
ever
to
feel
jealous
of
little
barbara
when
they
had
sent
her
to
bed
lady
isabel
laughed
with
more
animation
than
she
often
displayed
how
the
child
has
developed
charming
charming
said
sir
francis
we
must
show
her
something
of
the
world
i
think
even
if
she
is
rather
young
but
it
soon
became
evident
to
alex
at
least
that
barbara
had
not
been
without
glimpses
of
the
world
even
at
neuilly
she
listened
with
interest
but
very
coolly
to
alex
attempted
confidences
and
finally
said
well
i
ca
imagine
how
you
could
have
borne
to
give
up
the
diamond
ring
and
it
would
have
been
fun
to
get
married
and
have
a
trousseau
and
a
house
of
your
own
but
i
do
think
noel
would
make
much
of
a
husband
the
calm
disparagement
in
her
tone
annoyed
alex
it
seemed
to
rob
her
solitary
conquest
of
any
lingering
trace
of
glory
i
do
think
you
know
very
much
about
it
she
said
rather
scathingly
you
have
met
any
men
at
all
naturally
so
how
can
you
judge
barbara
laughed
something
of
security
that
would
not
even
take
the
trouble
to
dispute
the
point
pierced
through
that
cool
little
laugh
of
hers
later
on
she
told
alex
with
rather
overdone
that
a
young
frenchman
a
cousin
of
hélène
de
la
hautefeuille
had
fallen
very
much
in
love
with
her
at
neuilly
alex
at
first
pretended
not
to
believe
her
although
she
felt
an
uncomfortable
inward
certainty
that
barbara
would
never
waste
words
on
an
idle
boast
that
could
not
be
substantiated
you
need
not
believe
me
if
you
do
want
to
said
barbara
indifferently
but
how
could
you
i
thought
the
marquise
was
so
particular
so
she
was
they
all
are
in
france
with
ridiculous
but
of
course
as
hélène
was
his
cousin
they
were
quite
so
strict
and
he
used
to
give
her
notes
and
things
for
me
barbara
you
need
be
so
shocked
alex
of
course
never
wrote
to
that
would
have
been
too
stupid
but
he
very
nice
and
simply
madly
in
love
with
me
hélène
said
he
always
admired
type
and
that
i
was
his
ideal
alex
was
thoroughly
angered
at
the
complacency
in
barbara
voice
you
and
hélène
are
two
silly
vulgar
little
schoolgirls
i
think
you
could
be
so
so
common
barbara
what
on
earth
would
father
and
mother
say
i
daresay
they
would
mind
so
very
much
said
barbara
calmly
so
long
as
they
did
know
about
the
notes
and
our
having
met
once
or
twice
in
the
garden
i
do
believe
it
exclaimed
alex
you
think
it
sounds
and
so
you
exaggerating
the
whole
thing
barbara
looked
at
her
sister
with
her
eyebrows
cocked
in
a
provoking
conceited
sort
of
way
not
angrily
but
rather
contemptuously
really
alex
to
hear
you
make
such
a
fuss
about
it
any
one
would
think
that
you
never
set
eyes
on
a
man
of
course
that
sort
of
thing
happens
as
soon
as
one
begins
to
get
it
part
of
the
fun
you
know
mother
would
say
it
was
vulgar
it
was
almost
a
relief
to
see
one
of
barbara
rare
blushes
at
the
word
i
do
see
why
it
should
be
more
vulgar
than
you
and
noel
how
can
you
be
so
ridiculous
of
course
that
was
quite
different
we
were
both
and
properly
engaged
and
everything
alex
said
barbara
suddenly
when
you
were
engaged
did
he
ever
kiss
you
alex
turned
nearly
as
scarlet
as
her
sister
had
been
a
moment
before
shut
up
she
said
savagely
a
thought
struck
her
you
do
mean
to
say
you
ever
let
that
beastly
french
boy
try
to
do
anything
like
that
she
demanded
no
no
said
barbara
hastily
of
course
not
but
he
not
such
a
boy
as
all
that
you
know
he
has
a
moustache
and
he
doing
his
now
otherwise
said
barbara
calmly
i
daresay
he
would
have
followed
me
to
england
you
conceited
little
idiot
he
must
have
been
laughing
at
you
barbara
shrugged
her
shoulders
with
a
gesture
that
had
certainly
not
been
acquired
in
clevedon
square
you
see
for
yourself
presently
she
remarked
he
going
to
get
his
next
month
and
he
coming
to
london
you
do
suppose
you
be
able
to
go
sneaking
about
writing
notes
and
meeting
him
in
corners
do
you
cried
alex
horrified
barbara
looked
at
her
disdainfully
and
gave
deft
little
pulls
and
pats
to
the
bow
on
her
hair
so
that
it
stood
out
more
than
ever
what
on
earth
do
you
take
me
for
alex
of
course
i
know
as
well
as
you
do
that
that
sort
of
thing
ca
be
done
in
london
it
will
all
be
perfectly
proper
said
barbara
superbly
i
have
given
him
permission
to
call
here
alex
remained
speechless
she
was
quite
unable
to
share
in
the
tolerant
amusement
with
which
her
parents
apparently
viewed
the
astonishing
emancipation
of
barbara
although
it
was
true
that
barbara
still
retained
a
sufficient
sense
of
decorum
to
describe
achille
de
villefranche
to
them
merely
as
a
cousin
of
hélène
who
would
like
to
come
and
call
when
he
is
in
london
lady
isabel
acceded
to
the
proposed
visit
with
gracious
amusement
and
alex
wondered
jealously
why
her
own
attempts
to
prove
and
like
other
girls
never
seemed
to
succeed
as
did
barbara
preposterous
pretensions
until
she
remembered
with
a
pang
that
after
all
had
never
had
to
ask
whether
admiring
strangers
might
call
upon
her
she
knew
instinctively
that
however
much
lady
isabel
might
exact
in
the
way
of
elaborate
chaperonage
she
would
secretly
have
welcomed
any
such
proof
of
her
daughter
attraction
for
members
of
the
opposite
sex
one
day
barbara
more
boastful
or
less
secretive
than
usual
showed
alex
one
of
achille
notes
written
to
her
on
the
day
that
she
had
left
neuilly
alex
deciphered
the
pointed
writing
with
some
difficulty
and
then
turned
first
hot
and
then
cold
as
she
remembered
the
few
letters
she
had
ever
received
from
noel
cardew
written
during
the
period
of
their
lawful
sanctioned
engagement
when
she
had
so
fiercely
told
herself
that
of
course
a
man
was
never
romantic
on
paper
and
that
his
very
reticence
only
proved
the
depth
of
his
feeling
and
all
that
time
barbara
utterly
cold
and
merely
superciliously
amused
had
been
the
recipient
of
this
latin
hyperbole
these
impassioned
poetical
flights
petite
rose
blanche
douce
sainte
good
heavens
he
had
never
seen
barbara
in
one
of
her
cold
furies
when
she
would
sulk
in
perfect
silence
for
three
days
on
end
and
finally
with
humble
pleadings
that
he
might
be
forgiven
for
such
a
achille
apostrophized
her
as
mignonne
alex
could
hardly
believe
that
it
was
really
barbara
who
had
inspired
these
romantic
ebullitions
how
did
you
answer
him
she
asked
breathlessly
i
did
answer
at
all
barbara
coolly
replied
you
do
suppose
i
was
so
silly
as
that
do
you
why
girls
get
into
the
most
awful
difficulties
by
writing
letters
and
signing
their
names
and
then
the
man
wo
let
them
have
the
letters
back
afterwards
achille
has
never
had
one
single
scrap
of
writing
from
me
alex
felt
as
much
rebuked
as
angered
by
this
display
of
worldly
wisdom
she
knew
and
was
sure
that
barbara
pluming
herself
over
her
own
shrewdness
knew
also
that
had
she
herself
been
able
to
provoke
similar
protestations
no
considerations
of
prudence
or
discretion
would
have
restrained
the
ardour
of
her
response
during
the
easter
holidays
barbara
remained
in
the
schoolroom
sometimes
playing
with
archie
and
pamela
but
generally
engaged
on
one
of
the
many
forms
of
embroidery
which
she
appeared
to
have
learned
at
neuilly
or
diligently
practising
her
french
songs
at
the
schoolroom
piano
she
did
not
appear
to
be
at
all
envious
of
alex
privileges
for
which
alex
felt
rather
wonderingly
grateful
to
her
until
one
day
when
she
was
out
driving
with
lady
isabel
when
a
sudden
enlightenment
fell
upon
her
what
do
you
think
of
this
ambition
of
little
barbara
her
mother
asked
her
with
a
trace
of
hesitation
what
asked
alex
stupidly
why
this
frantic
wish
of
hers
to
be
presented
next
may
and
allowed
to
make
her
début
she
will
be
seventeen
after
all
and
she
seems
to
have
set
her
heart
on
it
barbara
she
wants
to
be
presented
and
come
out
in
may
why
nearly
april
now
mother
that
would
mean
in
another
six
weeks
alex
was
stupefied
has
she
said
anything
to
you
said
lady
isabel
with
a
sort
of
vague
unperceiving
wonder
funny
little
thing
i
thought
she
would
have
been
sure
to
have
talked
it
all
over
with
you
she
been
and
implorin
us
ever
since
she
got
back
from
neuilly
and
your
father
is
half
inclined
to
say
she
may
how
like
barbara
begging
and
imploring
them
to
let
her
be
presented
next
may
and
all
the
time
saying
nothing
at
all
to
alex
and
slyly
pretending
to
care
nothing
for
coming
out
and
listening
with
deceptive
quiet
to
alex
little
occasional
speeches
made
to
mark
the
difference
between
twenty
and
seventeen
no
doubt
barbara
knew
very
well
that
she
would
get
her
own
way
by
dint
of
ardent
pleading
and
did
not
want
the
effect
of
her
arguments
and
representations
to
be
spoilt
by
alex
vigorous
protest
for
of
course
alex
was
indignant
why
should
barbara
come
out
when
she
was
barely
seventeen
when
her
sister
had
had
to
wait
until
the
orthodox
eighteen
alex
might
not
value
her
privileges
highly
but
she
was
far
from
wishing
barbara
to
share
them
in
the
depths
of
her
soul
was
a
lurking
consciousness
that
neither
did
she
want
critical
barbara
to
see
how
poor
and
dull
a
figure
her
sister
cut
after
the
imaginary
triumphs
of
which
she
had
so
often
boasted
lady
isabel
might
be
disappointed
but
she
never
voiced
her
disappointment
or
hinted
at
it
and
alex
thought
she
tried
to
conceal
it
from
herself
but
barbara
would
not
be
disappointed
she
might
be
rather
pleased
and
make
the
small
veiled
spiteful
comments
by
which
she
occasionally
and
always
unexpectedly
paid
one
back
for
past
slights
or
unkindnesses
alex
felt
that
she
could
not
bear
any
further
mortifications
the
question
of
barbara
coming
out
was
still
undecided
principally
owing
to
alex
strenuous
efforts
to
persuade
her
mother
not
to
allow
it
when
achille
de
villefranche
made
the
ceremonious
visit
to
clevedon
square
which
barbara
had
announced
he
came
on
a
sunday
so
soon
after
three
that
lady
luncheon
guests
had
barely
departed
and
sat
on
the
extreme
edge
of
his
chair
a
slim
umbrella
between
his
knees
and
his
silk
hat
balanced
on
the
top
of
it
his
tie
was
tied
into
an
astonishing
bow
with
ends
that
irresistibly
reminded
alex
of
he
spoke
excellent
english
very
rapidly
but
occasionally
lapsed
into
still
more
rapid
french
in
which
he
poured
forth
his
enthusiasm
for
cette
chère
île
des
brouillards
which
description
of
her
native
land
was
fortunately
uncomprehended
by
lady
isabel
altogether
achille
was
so
like
a
frenchman
on
the
stage
that
alex
almost
expected
to
see
him
fall
upon
his
knees
in
the
when
barbara
demurely
obeyed
the
summons
sent
up
to
the
schoolroom
by
her
mother
and
appeared
in
her
prim
schoolroom
frock
he
certainly
sprang
to
his
feet
with
a
sort
of
bound
but
any
further
intentions
were
frustrated
by
his
elegant
umbrella
which
got
between
his
feet
and
nearly
tripped
him
up
and
sent
his
beautiful
rolling
into
the
furthest
corner
of
the
alex
had
to
recognize
that
achille
behaved
with
great
presence
of
mind
even
taken
at
such
a
disadvantage
he
bowed
over
barbara
hand
at
the
same
time
kicking
his
umbrella
carelessly
aside
he
waved
a
contemptuous
hand
which
made
the
behaviour
of
his
hat
a
thing
of
no
account
and
he
did
not
even
trouble
himself
to
retrieve
it
until
barbara
was
seated
when
he
strolled
away
to
pick
it
up
in
a
nonchalant
manner
talking
all
the
time
of
other
things
but
in
spite
of
the
of
achille
alex
felt
that
the
whole
affair
was
of
the
nature
of
a
farce
and
was
ashamed
of
herself
for
deriving
unmistakable
satisfaction
from
the
conviction
that
no
one
could
take
barbara
conquest
seriously
even
sir
francis
who
found
achille
still
discoursing
in
the
on
his
return
from
the
club
at
seven
indulged
in
a
little
mild
chaffing
of
his
younger
daughter
when
de
villefranche
amid
many
bows
had
finally
taken
his
leave
barbara
responded
with
a
sprightly
amiability
that
she
had
never
displayed
in
her
days
and
which
alex
angrily
and
uncomprehendingly
perceived
both
pleased
and
amused
sir
francis
but
i
am
not
sure
i
approve
of
your
taste
in
the
selection
of
your
admirers
my
dear
he
said
humorously
his
right
hand
lightly
swinging
his
glasses
against
his
left
i
have
never
met
any
englishmen
you
know
father
said
barbara
piteously
opening
her
eyes
very
wide
if
mother
would
only
let
me
come
out
this
year
and
see
a
few
people
alex
was
aghast
at
barbara
duplicity
recognizing
perfectly
her
manoeuvre
of
implying
that
only
her
mother
consent
was
still
required
for
her
début
well
well
well
said
sir
francis
wearing
the
expression
of
an
indulgent
parent
but
surely
young
ladies
are
expected
to
wait
till
their
eighteenth
birthday
oh
but
i
so
like
a
long
frock
sighed
barbara
her
head
on
one
side
an
admirable
rendering
of
the
typical
young
lady
known
and
admired
of
her
father
generation
sir
francis
laughed
unmistakable
yielding
foreshadowed
in
his
tone
and
in
the
glance
he
directed
towards
his
wife
isabel
we
shall
have
a
regular
little
society
butterfly
on
our
hands
what
do
you
think
lady
isabel
also
smiling
nevertheless
said
almost
reluctantly
as
though
to
imply
that
assent
would
be
in
defiance
of
her
better
judgment
of
course
this
year
will
be
exceptionally
gay
because
of
the
jubilee
i
should
rather
like
her
to
come
out
when
there
is
so
much
going
on
but
i
do
quite
know
about
taking
two
of
them
everywhere
she
glanced
at
alex
and
sighed
almost
involuntarily
it
was
impossible
not
to
remember
the
tentative
plans
that
they
had
discussed
so
short
a
while
ago
for
a
brilliant
wedding
that
should
take
place
just
when
all
london
was
busy
with
festivals
in
honour
of
the
queen
diamond
jubilee
the
same
recollection
shot
like
a
pang
through
alex
feeling
the
pain
of
her
mother
disappointment
far
more
acutely
than
her
own
humiliation
and
making
her
speak
sharply
and
almost
unaware
of
what
she
said
sooner
than
endure
a
moment
silence
you
can
take
barbara
instead
of
me
i
hate
balls
and
i
sick
of
going
to
things
she
was
horrified
at
the
sound
of
the
words
as
she
spoke
them
and
at
her
own
roughened
mortified
voice
there
was
a
moment
silence
that
said
sir
francis
gently
and
gravely
is
neither
a
very
gracious
nor
a
very
dutiful
speech
alex
your
mother
has
spared
herself
neither
trouble
nor
fatigue
in
conducting
you
to
those
entertainments
organized
for
your
pleasure
and
advantage
and
it
is
a
poor
reward
for
her
many
sacrifices
to
be
told
with
a
scowling
face
that
you
are
of
going
about
if
those
are
your
sentiments
i
shall
strongly
advise
her
to
consult
her
own
convenience
in
the
future
instead
of
making
everything
give
way
to
your
pleasures
as
she
has
done
for
the
last
two
years
lady
isabel
looked
distressed
and
said
it
is
very
difficult
to
know
what
you
want
alex
if
you
only
say
i
do
want
anything
i
quite
happy
began
alex
overwhelmed
with
the
sense
of
her
own
ingratitude
and
by
way
of
proving
her
words
she
began
to
cry
hopelessly
although
she
knew
that
sir
francis
could
not
bear
tears
and
that
anything
in
the
nature
of
a
scene
made
lady
isabel
fed
control
yourself
said
her
father
they
all
looked
at
her
in
silence
and
her
nervousness
made
her
give
a
loud
sob
if
you
are
hysterical
alex
you
had
better
go
to
bed
alex
was
only
too
thankful
to
obey
still
sobbing
she
received
the
conventional
kiss
which
neither
she
nor
her
parents
would
have
dreamed
of
omitting
however
deep
their
displeasure
with
her
and
left
the
room
reproaching
herself
bitterly
they
had
all
been
so
cheerful
before
she
spoilt
it
all
sir
francis
in
unwontedly
good
spirits
and
both
of
them
pleased
at
the
harmless
amusement
caused
by
barbara
visitor
i
spoil
alex
told
herself
passionately
and
longed
for
some
retreat
where
she
might
be
the
solitary
victim
of
her
own
temperament
and
need
not
bear
the
double
pang
of
the
vexation
and
grief
which
she
inflicted
upon
others
she
did
not
go
downstairs
to
dinner
and
soon
after
eight
barbara
came
in
and
told
her
that
there
was
supper
in
the
schoolroom
for
both
of
them
though
after
this
said
barbara
importantly
i
shall
be
having
dinner
properly
in
the
quite
soon
they
are
going
to
let
me
put
up
my
hair
and
i
they
will
let
me
be
presented
at
a
late
though
they
wo
promise
it
was
settled
after
you
went
upstairs
are
they
vexed
with
me
asked
alex
dejectedly
not
particularly
only
disappointed
alex
would
rather
have
been
told
that
they
were
angry
she
had
not
spirit
enough
left
to
snub
barbara
discoursing
untiringly
of
all
that
she
meant
to
do
and
to
wear
until
at
last
her
younger
sister
remarked
patronizingly
cheer
up
alex
i
believe
you
afraid
of
my
cutting
you
out
but
we
shall
be
quite
different
styles
you
know
i
ca
hope
to
be
a
beauty
so
i
shall
go
in
for
being
hélène
always
says
it
pays
in
the
long
run
by
the
bye
achille
thought
you
were
very
pretty
how
do
you
know
he
told
me
so
nonsense
how
could
he
i
was
in
the
room
the
whole
time
oh
there
are
ways
and
means
retorted
barbara
tossing
her
head
alex
would
not
gratify
her
by
asking
further
questions
to
her
habitual
fashion
of
ignoring
slights
until
it
became
convenient
to
repay
them
however
barbara
added
now
an
impervious
armour
of
at
the
prospect
of
her
approaching
entry
into
the
world
she
even
three
months
later
received
with
no
other
display
of
feeling
than
a
rather
contemptuous
little
laugh
the
de
faire
which
announced
the
approaching
marriage
of
hélène
de
métrancourt
de
la
hautefeuille
to
her
cousin
achille
marie
de
villefranche
xv
diamond
jubilee
all
that
summer
every
one
spoke
of
jubilee
weather
and
london
grew
hotter
and
sunnier
and
more
crowded
day
by
day
alex
found
herself
wishing
fretfully
and
almost
angrily
that
she
could
enjoy
it
all
but
the
sensation
of
loneliness
that
had
always
oppressed
her
although
she
did
not
analyse
it
was
always
most
poignant
amongst
a
great
number
of
people
and
her
listlessness
and
in
society
at
last
caused
lady
isabel
to
ask
her
gently
but
with
unmistakable
vexation
whether
she
had
rather
leave
most
of
the
gaieties
to
little
barbara
to
whom
it
all
new
and
amusing
why
asked
alex
startled
my
darling
i
can
see
you
not
very
happy
and
i
quite
understand
that
of
course
one
does
get
over
these
things
in
a
minute
said
lady
isabel
with
a
sigh
for
the
memory
of
noel
cardew
this
will
be
your
third
season
and
i
had
hoped
it
would
be
the
best
of
them
all
what
with
the
jubilee
celebrations
and
everything
but
if
you
rather
out
of
heart
with
the
gaieties
just
now
i
do
want
to
force
you
into
them
poor
child
lady
isabel
gazed
with
wistful
puzzled
eyes
that
held
nothing
but
uncomprehending
perplexity
at
her
disappointing
eldest
daughter
alex
knew
that
she
was
wondering
silently
why
that
daughter
expensively
educated
and
still
more
expensively
dressed
admittedly
pretty
and
should
still
lack
any
semblance
of
attractiveness
should
still
fail
to
achieve
any
semblance
of
popularity
alex
herself
wondered
drearily
if
she
was
always
destined
to
find
herself
out
of
all
harmony
with
her
surroundings
she
never
questioned
but
that
the
fault
lay
entirely
in
herself
and
a
sort
of
fatalism
made
her
accept
it
all
with
apathetic
she
gave
inert
acquiescence
to
lady
isabel
tentative
suggestion
that
most
of
the
invitations
pouring
in
daily
should
be
accepted
on
behalf
only
partly
because
she
hated
being
taken
out
with
her
sister
who
was
always
critical
and
observant
and
partly
from
sheer
desire
that
lady
isabel
should
no
longer
have
the
mortification
of
watching
a
social
progress
the
indifference
of
which
alex
regarded
with
morbid
exaggeration
barbara
rather
to
alex
surprise
although
enjoying
herself
with
a
sort
of
quiet
determination
proved
to
be
exceedingly
shy
but
in
two
months
she
had
achieved
several
gushing
intimate
friendships
with
girls
rather
older
than
herself
which
led
to
her
receiving
innumerable
invitations
to
a
form
of
entertainment
always
abhorred
by
alex
but
from
which
barbara
generally
returned
with
one
or
two
new
acquaintances
who
were
sure
to
claim
dances
from
her
on
meeting
her
at
subsequent
balls
she
was
not
very
pretty
and
evening
dresses
displaying
her
thin
arms
and
shoulders
took
away
from
the
effect
of
smartness
that
she
had
acquired
in
france
but
she
danced
exceptionally
well
and
was
seldom
left
partnerless
alex
often
wondered
what
barbara
who
was
notoriously
silent
and
awkward
with
strangers
could
find
to
talk
about
to
her
partners
it
did
not
occur
to
her
that
barbara
made
an
art
of
listening
to
them
the
climax
of
the
season
festivities
was
reached
on
the
blazing
day
towards
the
end
of
june
when
the
jubilee
procession
wound
its
way
through
the
flagged
and
decorated
streets
with
the
small
stout
figure
in
the
midst
of
it
all
bowing
indefatigably
to
the
crowds
that
thronged
streets
and
windows
and
balconies
and
even
when
practical
roofs
a
window
of
sir
francis
club
in
piccadilly
was
placed
by
him
with
some
ceremony
at
the
disposal
of
his
wife
his
eldest
son
up
from
eton
and
one
daughter
but
it
was
evident
that
he
would
regard
any
further
display
of
family
as
rather
excessive
and
alex
herself
suggested
that
she
should
see
it
all
from
a
window
in
grosvenor
place
which
had
been
procured
for
pamela
and
archie
under
the
care
of
old
nurse
and
various
minor
members
of
the
household
but
that
would
be
so
dull
protested
lady
isabel
shocked
alex
can
do
as
she
pleases
my
dear
said
sir
francis
stiffly
he
was
not
pleased
with
his
eldest
daughter
and
imagined
that
her
evident
shrinking
from
society
arose
not
from
her
acute
perception
of
this
fact
but
from
shame
at
the
recollection
of
her
behaviour
towards
noel
cardew
which
sir
francis
in
his
own
mind
stigmatized
as
both
dishonourable
and
unladylike
the
further
reflection
he
gave
to
the
matter
and
reflection
with
sir
francis
was
never
anything
but
deliberate
the
more
seriously
he
resented
his
daughter
lapse
from
the
code
of
good
form
and
the
harassed
look
which
she
was
gradually
causing
to
mar
his
wife
placid
beauty
he
would
have
liked
alex
to
be
prettily
eager
for
pleasure
as
were
the
young
ladies
of
his
day
and
ideal
and
he
regarded
her
obvious
discontent
and
unhappiness
as
a
slur
on
lady
isabel
exertions
on
her
behalf
very
slowly
with
the
dull
implacability
of
a
man
slow
to
assimilate
a
grievance
and
slower
still
to
forgive
what
he
does
not
understand
sir
francis
was
becoming
angry
with
alex
let
her
do
as
she
likes
isabel
he
repeated
if
the
society
we
can
provide
is
less
amusing
than
that
of
children
and
servants
by
all
means
let
her
join
them
lady
isabel
did
not
repeat
his
words
to
alex
she
only
said
your
father
says
do
as
you
like
darlin
we
sha
have
room
of
course
especially
as
we
have
asked
so
many
people
for
lunch
afterwards
but
if
you
really
cared
about
comin
with
us
i
could
manage
it
in
a
minute
she
paused
as
though
for
alex
eager
acclamation
but
barbara
broke
in
quickly
there
wo
be
room
with
all
those
people
coming
will
there
and
father
always
says
that
one
daughter
at
a
time
is
enough
so
if
alex
really
does
want
to
come
it
seems
a
pity
so
alex
with
an
unreasonable
sense
of
injury
that
yet
was
in
some
distorted
way
a
relief
to
her
as
showing
her
not
to
be
alone
in
fault
watched
the
procession
from
grosvenor
place
with
archie
flushed
and
shouting
with
excitement
and
pamela
in
curly
cropped
hair
and
liberty
silk
picture
frock
such
as
was
just
coming
into
fashion
breaking
into
shrill
cheers
of
rather
spasmodic
loyalty
as
she
fidgeted
up
and
down
the
length
of
the
balcony
alex
on
the
whole
was
sorry
when
it
was
all
over
and
the
two
children
ordered
into
the
carriage
by
nurse
for
the
return
to
clevedon
square
she
declared
that
she
was
going
to
walk
home
across
the
park
partly
because
the
crowds
interested
her
partly
to
assert
her
independence
of
old
nurse
then
you
take
james
with
you
in
a
crowd
like
this
the
old
autocrat
declared
nonsense
i
do
want
james
you
come
with
me
wo
you
holland
yes
miss
said
the
maid
submissively
since
barbara
coming
out
the
sisters
had
shared
a
maid
of
their
own
and
holland
very
much
preferred
alex
who
cared
nothing
what
happened
to
her
clothes
and
read
a
book
all
the
time
that
her
hair
was
being
dressed
to
the
exacting
and
sometimes
rather
querulous
barbara
they
found
the
park
comparatively
free
from
people
every
one
had
gone
to
find
some
place
of
refreshment
or
had
made
a
rush
to
secure
places
for
the
return
route
of
the
procession
from
paul
cathedral
flags
streamed
and
waved
in
the
sunshine
and
swinging
rows
of
little
electric
globes
hung
everywhere
in
readiness
for
the
evening
display
of
illuminations
alex
suddenly
felt
very
tired
and
hot
and
longed
to
escape
from
the
glare
and
the
noise
she
wondered
whether
if
noel
had
been
with
her
she
could
have
taken
part
in
the
general
sense
of
holiday
and
rejoicing
sharing
it
with
him
and
whilst
her
aching
loneliness
cried
yes
some
instinct
warned
her
that
a
companionship
rooted
only
in
proximity
brings
with
it
a
deeper
sense
of
isolation
than
any
solitude
her
steps
began
to
flag
and
she
wished
that
the
way
through
the
park
did
not
seem
so
interminable
could
we
find
a
cab
holland
i
tired
it
wo
be
easy
miss
today
said
the
maid
a
disquieted
eye
roving
over
the
park
railings
to
the
dusty
streets
where
pedestrians
indeed
thronged
endlessly
but
few
vehicles
of
any
sort
were
to
be
discerned
alex
would
have
liked
to
sit
down
but
none
of
the
benches
were
unoccupied
and
in
any
case
she
knew
that
lady
isabel
would
be
shocked
at
her
doing
such
a
thing
under
no
better
chaperonage
than
that
of
a
maid
quite
conscious
of
her
own
unreason
she
yet
said
fretfully
i
really
ca
get
all
the
way
home
unless
i
can
sit
down
and
rest
somewhere
she
had
only
said
it
to
relieve
her
own
sense
of
fatigue
and
irritability
and
was
surprised
when
holland
replied
in
a
tone
of
reasonable
suggestion
there
the
convent
just
close
to
bryanston
square
miss
you
can
always
go
in
there
it
always
open
what
convent
holland
named
the
order
of
the
house
at
liège
where
alex
had
been
at
school
she
exclaimed
at
the
coincidence
i
thought
their
london
house
was
in
the
east
end
yes
miss
holland
explained
becoming
suddenly
voluble
but
the
sisters
opened
a
new
house
last
year
i
went
to
the
consecration
of
the
chapel
it
was
a
beautiful
ceremony
miss
of
course
you
a
catholic
are
you
i
forgot
yes
miss
said
holland
stiffening
it
was
evident
that
the
fact
to
which
alex
referred
so
lightly
was
of
supreme
importance
to
her
well
a
church
is
better
than
nowhere
in
this
heat
said
miss
clare
disconsolately
lady
isabel
had
decreed
nearly
two
years
ago
that
at
all
events
during
the
season
was
incompatible
with
late
nights
and
alex
had
acquiesced
without
much
difficulty
religion
did
not
interest
her
and
she
had
kept
up
no
intercourse
with
the
nuns
at
liège
since
leaving
school
holland
looking
at
once
shocked
and
rather
excited
pointed
out
the
tall
narrow
building
wedged
into
a
line
of
similar
buildings
with
a
high
flight
of
steps
leading
to
the
open
door
it
always
open
like
that
holland
said
any
one
can
go
into
the
chapel
the
open
door
indeed
gave
straight
on
to
the
oak
door
of
the
chapel
across
a
narrow
entrance
lobby
alex
was
instantly
conscious
of
the
contrast
between
the
hot
glare
and
incessant
roar
of
multifarious
noises
outside
in
the
brilliant
streets
and
the
dark
cool
hush
that
pervaded
the
silent
convent
chapel
the
sudden
sensation
of
physical
relief
almost
brought
tears
to
her
eyes
as
she
sank
thankfully
on
to
a
little
cushioned
drawn
up
close
to
the
high
carved
before
the
chancel
steps
holland
had
slid
noiselessly
to
her
knees
behind
one
of
the
humble
wooden
benches
close
to
the
entrance
there
was
absolute
silence
as
her
eyes
grew
accustomed
to
the
soft
gloom
alex
saw
that
the
chapel
was
a
very
small
one
of
an
odd
oblong
shape
with
high
carved
stalls
on
either
side
of
it
that
recalled
the
big
convent
chapel
at
liège
to
her
mind
the
wax
candles
shed
a
peculiarly
mild
glow
over
the
high
altar
which
was
decked
with
a
mass
of
white
blossom
and
feathery
green
but
the
rest
of
the
chapel
was
unlit
except
by
the
warm
softened
shaft
of
sunshine
that
struck
through
the
painted
oval
windows
behind
the
altar
and
lay
in
deep
splashes
of
colour
over
the
and
the
altar
steps
the
peace
and
harmony
of
her
surroundings
fell
on
alex
wearied
spirit
with
an
almost
poignant
realization
of
their
beauty
the
impression
thus
made
upon
her
striking
with
utter
unexpectedness
struck
deep
and
to
the
end
of
her
life
the
remembrance
was
to
remain
with
her
of
the
sudden
sense
which
had
come
upon
her
of
entering
into
another
world
when
she
stepped
straight
from
the
streets
of
london
into
the
convent
chapel
on
diamond
jubilee
day
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
been
sitting
still
there
for
some
time
scarcely
conscious
of
thought
or
feeling
when
the
remembrance
gradually
began
to
filter
through
her
mind
as
it
were
of
teachings
unheeded
at
the
time
from
her
schooldays
at
liège
what
if
the
solution
to
all
her
troubles
lay
here
before
the
small
gilt
door
of
the
tabernacle
alex
had
never
prayed
in
her
life
the
mechanical
formula
extorted
from
the
clare
children
by
old
nurse
had
held
no
meaning
for
them
least
of
all
to
alex
who
was
not
temperamentally
religious
and
instinctively
disliked
anything
which
was
presented
to
her
in
the
light
of
an
obligation
her
lack
of
fundamental
religious
instruction
had
remained
undiscovered
and
consequently
unrectified
throughout
her
schooldays
and
she
had
unconsciously
adopted
since
then
the
standard
typified
no
less
in
sir
francis
courteously
blank
attitude
towards
the
faith
of
his
fathers
than
in
lady
isabel
conventional
adherence
to
the
minimum
of
permitted
by
the
social
code
what
if
comfort
had
been
waiting
for
her
all
the
time
come
unto
me
all
ye
that
labour
and
are
heavy
burdened
and
i
will
refresh
you
alex
did
not
know
that
she
was
crying
until
she
found
herself
wiping
away
the
tears
that
were
blinding
her
the
loneliness
that
encompassed
her
seemed
to
her
to
be
suddenly
lightened
and
she
formulated
the
first
vague
stammering
prayer
of
her
life
help
me
make
me
good
and
let
there
be
some
one
soon
who
will
understand
some
one
who
will
understand
and
still
love
me
who
will
want
me
to
care
too
if
only
there
was
some
one
for
whose
sake
everything
really
mattered
i
believe
i
could
be
good
please
help
me
she
felt
certain
that
her
prayer
would
be
heard
and
granted
there
was
the
slightest
possible
movement
beside
her
and
turning
sharply
she
saw
the
tall
figure
of
a
woman
wearing
the
habit
of
the
order
standing
over
her
she
had
not
known
that
this
nun
was
in
the
chapel
the
tall
commanding
presence
bent
and
knelt
down
on
the
ground
beside
her
with
a
deep
inclination
of
her
head
towards
the
high
altar
forgive
me
for
disturbing
you
but
when
you
are
quite
ready
to
come
away
will
you
come
and
speak
to
me
for
a
moment
or
two
before
you
go
she
paused
for
a
second
but
alex
was
too
much
surprised
to
reply
do
hurry
i
shall
wait
for
you
outside
the
nun
rose
slowly
laying
her
hand
for
an
instant
on
alex
shoulder
and
moved
soundlessly
away
alex
looked
at
her
watch
and
was
surprised
by
the
lateness
of
the
hour
she
drew
down
her
veil
and
gathered
up
the
long
fashionable
skirt
of
her
dress
preparatory
to
leaving
the
chapel
in
the
little
lobby
outside
she
looked
round
curiously
on
the
instant
some
one
moved
forward
out
of
a
shadowy
corner
come
in
here
for
a
moment
wo
you
i
think
it
is
miss
clare
yes
alex
faintly
uneasy
although
she
could
not
have
explained
why
looked
round
for
her
maid
holland
came
forward
at
once
good
afternoon
mary
said
the
nun
addressing
her
calmly
how
are
you
very
well
thank
you
mother
gertrude
i
had
hoped
to
be
here
again
so
soon
but
miss
clare
was
tired
and
we
were
just
going
past
on
the
way
back
after
the
procession
ah
yes
to
be
sure
said
the
nun
with
the
air
of
recalling
an
unimportant
fact
the
jubilee
procession
takes
place
today
that
must
make
the
streets
unpleasantly
crowded
wo
you
rest
a
little
while
in
the
parlour
miss
clare
perhaps
your
maid
might
find
a
cab
to
take
you
home
will
you
try
holland
said
alex
eagerly
she
felt
unable
to
walk
any
more
this
time
holland
made
no
demur
at
the
suggestion
and
only
glanced
a
respectful
farewell
at
the
nun
who
said
with
a
smile
that
seemed
somehow
full
of
authority
then
mary
for
the
present
i
will
take
care
of
your
young
lady
whilst
you
are
away
it
may
take
a
little
while
to
find
a
cab
on
a
day
like
this
as
the
maid
went
out
mother
gertrude
motioned
to
alex
to
precede
her
down
the
small
uneven
steps
leading
out
of
the
lobby
into
a
passage
beyond
there
are
two
steps
down
that
all
these
old
houses
are
dark
and
inconveniently
built
but
we
are
lucky
to
get
anything
so
central
come
into
the
parlour
we
shall
not
be
disturbed
and
your
maid
will
know
where
to
find
us
when
she
returns
i
had
no
idea
that
holland
came
here
and
and
knew
you
said
alex
rather
confused
in
the
stiff
ugly
parlour
furnished
with
chairs
and
a
round
table
it
was
easy
to
see
mother
gertrude
as
she
seated
herself
opposite
to
alex
in
the
window
she
was
an
exceptionally
tall
upright
woman
a
natural
dignity
of
carriage
emphasized
by
the
sweeping
black
folds
of
veil
and
habit
her
hands
demurely
hidden
under
the
sleeves
as
she
sat
with
arms
lightly
crossed
her
strong
handsome
face
of
a
uniform
light
reddish
colour
showed
one
or
two
hard
lines
noticeably
round
the
closed
determined
mouth
and
her
eyebrows
almost
met
over
very
light
grey
eyes
even
her
religious
habit
could
not
conceal
the
lines
and
contour
of
a
magnificent
figure
belonging
to
a
woman
in
the
full
maturity
of
life
are
you
surprised
to
find
that
your
maid
comes
to
the
convent
she
asked
smiling
her
voice
was
deep
and
of
a
commanding
quality
that
seemed
to
match
her
personality
but
her
smile
was
her
least
attractive
feature
it
was
only
a
slow
widening
of
her
mouth
showing
a
set
of
patently
porcelain
teeth
and
deepening
the
creases
on
either
side
of
her
face
her
eyes
remained
watchful
and
unchanged
mary
holland
was
one
of
our
children
when
she
was
quite
a
little
thing
at
our
at
bermondsey
she
has
always
been
a
good
girl
and
we
take
a
great
interest
in
her
was
that
why
you
knew
who
i
was
alex
inquired
remembering
how
the
nun
had
addressed
her
yes
i
knew
that
mary
holland
had
taken
a
place
with
lady
isabel
clare
and
was
much
interested
to
hear
from
her
of
her
lady
tell
me
were
you
not
at
school
at
our
in
belgium
alex
unversed
in
the
infinitely
ramifications
of
communication
was
again
surprised
yes
i
was
there
for
about
five
years
but
i
do
remember
she
hesitated
oh
no
i
was
never
there
i
have
been
superior
in
london
for
more
than
ten
years
but
i
have
heard
your
name
several
times
though
not
since
you
left
school
we
like
to
keep
in
touch
with
our
children
but
you
have
probably
been
busy
going
about
with
your
mother
i
did
even
know
there
was
a
house
of
the
order
here
alex
admitted
it
has
not
been
established
very
long
our
chapel
was
only
consecrated
a
few
months
ago
it
is
very
tiny
but
perhaps
some
day
you
will
pay
another
visit
here
mother
gertrude
was
not
looking
at
alex
as
she
spoke
but
down
at
her
own
long
rosary
beads
and
the
fact
somehow
made
it
easier
for
alex
to
reply
without
embarrassment
yes
i
should
like
to
come
if
i
may
and
if
i
can
it
felt
so
so
peaceful
yes
returned
the
nun
without
any
show
of
surprise
or
indeed
any
emotion
at
all
in
her
carefully
colourless
voice
yes
it
is
very
peaceful
here
a
great
contrast
to
the
hurry
and
unrest
of
the
world
and
for
any
one
who
is
tired
or
troubled
or
perhaps
unhappy
and
conscious
of
there
is
always
comfort
to
be
found
here
no
one
asks
any
questions
and
if
perhaps
a
poor
soul
is
too
much
with
conflict
for
prayer
why
even
that
is
not
necessary
alex
gazed
at
her
surprised
do
you
think
that
god
wants
things
put
into
words
said
the
nun
with
her
slow
smile
alex
did
not
know
what
to
reply
she
looked
silently
at
the
superior
and
felt
that
those
light
penetrating
grey
eyes
had
probed
to
the
depths
of
her
confusion
and
beyond
it
to
the
scenes
of
loneliness
and
bewilderment
that
had
made
her
weep
in
the
chapel
do
a
lot
of
people
come
here
she
asked
involuntarily
from
the
sense
that
a
wide
experience
of
humanity
must
have
gone
to
the
making
of
those
keen
perceptions
yes
many
of
them
i
know
and
see
here
and
anything
that
passes
in
this
little
room
is
held
in
sacred
confidence
but
very
often
of
course
there
are
visitors
to
the
chapel
of
whom
we
know
nothing
just
that
was
what
i
was
the
nun
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
and
yet
she
said
slowly
something
made
me
want
to
come
and
speak
to
you
even
before
i
caught
sight
of
your
maid
and
guessed
you
must
be
miss
clare
it
is
curious
that
you
should
have
turned
out
to
be
one
of
our
children
alex
thought
so
too
but
the
term
with
its
sense
of
shelter
touched
her
strangely
she
was
shaken
both
by
physical
fatigue
and
her
recent
violent
crying
and
moreover
the
forceful
magnetic
personality
of
the
superior
was
already
making
its
sure
impression
upon
her
young
unbalanced
susceptibilities
may
i
see
you
again
next
time
i
come
she
asked
rather
tremulously
mother
gertrude
stood
up
whenever
you
like
she
said
emphatically
her
direct
gaze
adding
weight
to
the
words
come
whenever
you
like
you
have
been
brought
here
by
what
looks
like
a
strange
chance
neglect
the
way
now
that
you
know
it
she
held
alex
hand
in
hers
for
a
moment
and
then
took
her
back
to
the
little
lobby
mary
has
actually
got
a
cab
that
is
very
clever
of
her
i
hope
they
will
not
have
been
anxious
about
you
at
home
you
must
tell
them
that
you
were
with
quite
safe
she
laid
a
slight
emphasis
on
the
words
smiling
a
little
said
alex
thank
you
very
much
repeated
the
nun
and
god
bless
you
my
child
xvi
mother
gertrude
alex
felt
strangely
comforted
for
some
time
after
that
visit
to
the
convent
it
seemed
to
her
that
in
appealing
to
the
god
who
dwelt
in
the
chapel
shrine
she
had
found
a
human
friend
secretly
she
thought
very
often
of
the
superior
wondering
if
mother
gertrude
remembered
her
and
thought
of
her
too
once
or
twice
when
she
was
out
with
holland
or
even
with
her
mother
she
manoeuvred
a
little
in
order
to
go
past
the
tall
building
and
look
up
curiously
at
its
shrouded
windows
but
she
did
not
actually
enter
the
convent
again
until
three
weeks
later
after
she
had
said
rather
defiantly
to
lady
isabel
do
you
mind
my
going
to
see
the
superior
of
the
convent
near
bryanston
square
mother
it
the
new
house
they
opened
a
branch
of
the
liège
house
you
know
if
you
like
said
lady
isabel
indifferently
what
put
it
into
your
head
holland
told
me
about
it
she
went
there
for
some
ceremony
or
other
when
they
opened
the
chapel
and
and
she
knew
i
been
at
school
at
liège
alex
answered
she
was
conscious
that
the
reply
was
evasive
but
she
was
afraid
of
admitting
that
she
had
already
made
acquaintance
with
the
superior
with
that
innate
sense
peculiar
to
the
period
in
which
she
lived
that
anything
undertaken
upon
the
initiative
of
a
child
would
be
regarded
as
wrong
or
dangerous
by
its
parents
but
mind
added
lady
isabel
suspiciously
i
wo
have
your
name
used
by
them
i
mean
that
you
are
not
to
promise
that
you
patronize
all
sorts
of
dowdy
impossible
charities
very
well
i
wo
alex
was
glad
to
have
permission
to
visit
the
convent
under
any
conditions
and
she
secretly
resolved
that
she
would
make
an
elastic
use
of
the
sanction
given
her
during
the
short
time
that
remained
before
the
usual
exodus
from
london
she
felt
half
afraid
that
mother
gertrude
might
have
forgotten
her
but
the
nun
greeted
her
with
a
warmth
that
fanned
to
instant
flame
the
spark
of
alex
ready
infatuation
she
quickly
fell
into
one
of
the
old
enamoured
enthusiasms
that
had
cost
her
so
much
in
her
childish
days
mother
gertrude
did
not
speak
of
religion
to
her
or
touch
upon
any
religious
teaching
but
she
encouraged
alex
to
speak
much
about
herself
and
to
admit
that
she
was
very
unhappy
have
you
no
one
at
home
they
do
understand
me
alex
said
with
conviction
that
is
hard
to
bear
and
you
are
very
sensitive
and
with
very
great
capabilities
for
either
good
or
evil
alex
thrilled
to
the
echo
of
a
conviction
which
she
had
hardly
dared
to
admit
to
herself
my
dear
child
do
you
mind
my
calling
you
so
oh
no
no
i
wish
you
would
call
me
by
my
name
alex
what
the
superior
said
smiling
as
though
you
were
one
of
my
own
children
in
spite
of
being
a
young
lady
of
the
world
oh
yes
if
you
let
me
breathed
alex
looking
up
at
the
woman
who
had
fascinated
her
with
all
the
fervour
of
her
ardent
unbalanced
temperament
in
her
gaze
my
poor
lonely
little
alex
you
shall
be
my
child
then
the
grave
lingering
kiss
on
her
forehead
came
like
a
consecration
alex
went
home
that
day
in
ecstasy
the
whole
force
of
her
nature
was
once
more
directed
into
one
channel
and
she
was
happy
one
day
she
told
mother
gertrude
with
the
complete
luxury
of
unreserve
always
characteristic
of
her
reckless
attachments
the
story
of
her
brief
engagement
to
noel
cardew
the
nun
looked
strangely
at
her
so
you
had
the
courage
to
go
against
the
wishes
of
your
family
and
break
it
all
off
little
alex
it
seemed
wonderful
to
alex
that
the
action
which
had
been
so
condemned
and
which
she
had
long
ceased
to
regard
as
anything
but
folly
should
be
praised
as
courageous
i
was
happy
she
faltered
i
used
always
to
think
that
love
which
one
read
about
made
everything
perfect
when
it
came
but
from
the
first
moment
of
our
engagement
i
knew
it
was
all
wrong
somehow
so
you
knew
that
the
superior
said
smilingly
you
have
been
given
very
great
gifts
me
how
faltered
alex
it
is
not
every
one
who
would
have
had
the
courage
to
withdraw
before
it
was
too
late
you
mean
it
would
have
been
much
worse
if
i
actually
married
him
much
much
worse
a
finite
human
love
will
never
satisfy
that
restless
heart
of
yours
alex
tell
me
have
you
ever
found
full
satisfaction
in
the
love
of
any
creature
yet
has
there
always
been
something
lacking
something
to
grieve
and
disappoint
you
alex
looked
back
she
thought
of
the
stormy
loves
of
her
childhood
of
queenie
on
whom
she
had
lavished
such
a
passion
of
devotion
of
her
vain
thwarted
longing
to
bestow
all
where
the
merest
modicum
would
have
sufficed
lastly
she
thought
of
noel
cardew
noel
did
not
want
all
that
i
could
have
given
him
she
faltered
he
never
knew
the
reallest
part
of
me
at
all
and
yet
he
loved
you
alex
he
wanted
you
for
his
wife
but
the
closest
of
human
intercourse
the
warmest
and
dearest
of
human
sympathy
will
never
be
enough
for
a
temperament
like
yours
she
spoke
with
such
authority
in
her
voice
that
alex
was
almost
frightened
shall
i
always
be
lonely
then
she
asked
feeling
that
whatever
the
answer
she
must
accept
it
unquestioningly
for
truth
until
you
have
learnt
the
lesson
which
i
think
is
before
you
said
the
nun
slowly
i
am
not
lonely
now
that
i
have
you
alex
asserted
clinging
passionately
to
her
hand
mother
gertrude
did
not
answer
she
never
contradicted
such
assertions
but
her
steady
light
eyes
gazed
outward
with
a
strange
pale
flame
as
though
at
some
unseen
bourne
destined
both
to
be
her
goal
and
that
of
alex
no
one
has
ever
understood
me
like
you
do
poor
little
child
i
think
i
understand
you
you
have
told
me
a
great
deal
and
your
confidence
has
meant
very
much
to
me
besides
the
superior
paused
a
nun
does
not
often
tell
her
own
story
but
i
am
going
to
tell
you
a
little
of
mine
it
is
not
so
very
unlike
your
own
when
i
was
seventeen
i
wanted
to
be
a
nun
i
told
my
parents
so
and
they
refused
their
permission
they
loved
me
very
very
dearly
and
i
was
the
only
child
my
father
told
me
that
it
would
break
his
heart
if
i
left
them
and
my
mother
was
delicate
almost
an
invalid
i
held
out
for
a
little
time
but
their
grief
nearly
broke
my
heart
and
i
persuaded
myself
that
it
was
my
duty
to
listen
to
them
and
to
stay
at
home
so
i
stifled
the
voice
of
god
in
my
heart
and
when
i
was
a
man
much
older
than
i
was
whom
i
had
known
all
my
life
asked
me
to
marry
him
the
nun
spoke
with
difficulty
i
have
not
spoken
of
this
to
any
human
being
for
over
twenty
years
but
i
believe
that
i
am
right
in
telling
you
a
little
of
what
i
went
through
i
will
gladly
bring
myself
to
speak
of
it
if
it
is
going
to
be
of
any
help
to
you
i
hesitated
for
a
long
while
he
told
me
that
he
loved
me
dearly
and
i
knew
it
was
true
i
knew
that
his
wife
would
have
the
happiest
of
homes
and
the
most
faithful
and
devoted
of
husbands
a
hundred
times
alex
i
was
on
the
verge
of
telling
him
that
i
would
marry
him
it
would
have
been
the
greatest
happiness
to
my
father
and
mother
and
it
would
have
done
away
once
and
for
all
with
that
lurking
dread
of
a
convent
which
i
knew
was
always
at
the
back
of
their
minds
they
were
growing
old
too
they
had
neither
of
them
been
young
people
when
i
was
born
and
i
knew
that
a
time
would
come
when
i
should
find
myself
all
alone
i
had
no
very
great
friends
and
very
few
relations
none
with
whom
i
could
have
found
a
home
and
in
those
days
a
woman
left
by
herself
had
very
little
freedom
very
few
outlets
indeed
i
had
given
up
the
thought
of
being
a
nun
altogether
i
thought
that
god
had
taken
away
the
gift
of
my
vocation
because
i
had
wilfully
neglected
it
even
at
my
blindest
i
could
never
persuade
myself
that
it
had
never
existed
that
vocation
which
i
had
tried
so
long
to
ignore
and
then
alex
god
in
his
great
love
again
took
pity
on
me
and
showed
me
where
my
treasure
really
was
i
had
tried
hard
to
cling
to
human
love
and
happiness
to
find
my
comfort
there
but
just
think
of
it
alex
a
divine
love
was
waiting
for
me
it
was
a
very
hard
struggle
alex
i
knew
that
he
wanted
of
me
unworthy
as
i
was
and
i
was
so
weak
and
so
cowardly
and
so
selfish
that
i
shrank
from
giving
all
i
knew
that
no
half
measures
would
be
possible
like
you
i
knew
that
it
would
have
to
be
with
me
all
or
none
to
whom
much
is
given
from
him
will
much
be
asked
alex
and
one
night
i
could
hold
out
no
longer
i
resolved
that
it
should
be
all
after
that
there
was
no
drawing
back
i
wrote
and
said
that
i
should
never
marry
that
my
mind
was
made
up
less
than
a
year
afterwards
i
was
in
the
convent
but
it
was
a
terrible
year
it
was
not
for
a
long
long
while
that
god
let
me
feel
any
consolation
time
after
time
i
felt
that
he
had
forsaken
me
and
i
could
only
cling
to
the
remembrance
of
the
certainty
that
i
had
felt
at
the
time
of
following
his
will
for
me
but
he
spared
me
the
greatest
sacrifice
of
all
knowing
perhaps
that
i
should
have
failed
again
in
courage
my
father
and
mother
died
within
three
months
of
one
another
that
same
year
and
when
my
father
lay
dying
he
gave
me
his
blessing
and
consent
and
after
he
died
i
went
straight
to
the
in
paris
where
it
was
then
and
a
few
months
after
i
became
an
orphan
they
received
me
into
the
novitiate
there
the
superior
had
flushed
very
deeply
and
her
voice
was
shaken
but
there
were
no
tears
in
her
steady
eyes
alex
trembling
with
passionate
sympathy
and
with
a
gratitude
so
intense
as
to
be
almost
painful
for
the
confidence
bestowed
upon
her
asked
the
inevitable
question
of
youth
have
you
been
happy
have
you
ever
regretted
it
oh
tell
me
if
you
are
really
and
truly
absolutely
said
mother
gertrude
unhesitatingly
but
not
with
happiness
such
as
the
world
knows
the
word
has
acquired
a
different
meaning
i
hardly
know
how
to
convey
what
i
mean
and
mean
something
so
utterly
different
to
the
soul
in
religious
life
and
to
the
soul
still
in
the
world
but
this
much
i
can
say
that
i
have
never
known
one
instant
of
regret
never
anything
but
the
deepest
most
intense
gratitude
that
i
was
given
strength
to
follow
my
vocation
there
was
a
long
silence
alex
watching
the
nun
fervent
gaze
in
which
her
young
idolatry
detected
none
of
the
resolute
fanaticism
built
up
in
instinctive
from
a
temperament
no
less
ardent
than
her
own
so
you
have
the
story
of
god
great
mercy
to
one
poor
soul
said
the
nun
at
last
and
the
story
of
every
vocation
is
equally
wonderful
the
more
i
see
of
souls
alex
and
a
superior
hears
many
things
the
more
i
marvel
at
the
ways
of
god
love
as
for
the
paths
by
which
he
led
me
to
the
shelter
of
his
own
house
i
shall
only
know
the
full
wonder
of
it
all
when
i
see
him
face
to
face
i
have
only
given
you
the
barest
outlines
but
you
understand
a
little
yes
breathed
alex
her
whole
being
shaken
by
an
emotion
to
the
real
danger
of
which
she
was
entirely
blind
she
went
home
that
day
in
a
state
of
exaltation
and
could
not
have
told
had
she
been
obliged
to
analyse
it
how
far
her
uplifted
condition
was
due
to
the
awakening
of
religious
perceptions
hitherto
undreamed
of
to
her
increasing
worship
of
the
woman
who
had
roused
those
perceptions
or
to
her
exultant
sense
of
having
been
made
the
repository
of
a
confidence
shared
with
no
other
human
being
it
was
small
wonder
that
lady
isabel
traced
the
rapt
look
on
alex
face
to
its
source
but
most
girls
go
through
this
sort
of
thing
at
school
she
said
hopelessly
of
course
i
know
it
is
only
a
phase
alex
whatever
you
may
think
now
but
ca
you
be
more
like
other
people
why
insist
all
of
a
sudden
on
makin
poor
holland
get
up
early
and
go
out
to
church
with
you
on
sunday
when
i
always
like
the
maids
to
have
a
rest
holland
does
mind
said
alex
sulkily
she
could
not
explain
to
her
mother
that
the
superior
had
asked
a
promise
of
her
that
she
would
not
again
willingly
miss
going
to
mass
on
sundays
if
it
was
a
reasonable
hour
i
should
object
so
much
i
know
heaps
of
very
devout
catholics
who
always
do
go
to
farm
street
or
somewhere
every
sunday
and
i
would
forbid
that
alex
though
you
should
suddenly
get
frantic
about
religion
i
ca
imagine
i
suppose
it
is
the
influence
of
that
woman
you
have
been
seein
at
the
convent
alex
grew
scarlet
to
her
own
dismay
i
thought
so
said
lady
isabel
looking
annoyed
i
do
want
to
prevent
your
doing
anything
that
give
you
pleasure
heaven
knows
it
difficult
enough
to
find
anything
you
seem
to
care
about
in
the
very
least
but
i
am
not
goin
to
let
you
infect
barbara
oh
no
said
alex
with
sincere
horror
in
her
voice
the
last
thing
she
wanted
was
to
take
barbara
to
the
convent
she
instinctively
dreaded
both
her
sister
shrewd
cynical
judgment
and
the
misrepresentations
that
she
always
somehow
contrived
to
make
of
all
alex
motives
and
actions
alex
clung
to
the
thought
of
her
exclusive
claim
on
mother
gertrude
interest
and
sympathy
as
she
had
never
yet
clung
to
any
other
possession
well
we
shall
be
leavin
town
next
week
and
there
be
an
end
of
it
when
i
said
you
might
go
to
the
convent
alex
i
never
meant
you
to
rush
off
there
three
or
four
times
a
week
as
you
know
but
if
you
have
taken
a
fancy
to
this
nun
i
suppose
nothing
will
stop
you
lady
isabel
sighed
and
alex
from
the
glow
of
contentment
that
possessed
her
felt
able
to
speak
more
warmly
and
natural
than
usual
i
do
want
to
do
anything
to
vex
you
mother
truly
i
do
but
the
superior
is
very
kind
to
me
and
i
do
like
going
to
see
her
you
know
you
always
say
you
want
me
to
do
whatever
makes
me
happiest
she
spoke
urgently
and
coaxingly
like
the
impulsive
impetuous
child
alex
who
had
been
used
to
beg
for
favours
and
privileges
with
all
the
confidence
of
a
favourite
lady
isabel
sighed
again
but
her
face
wore
a
touched
softened
look
and
she
said
resignedly
so
long
as
you
cheer
up
and
do
vex
your
father
by
seeming
doleful
and
uninterested
in
things
of
course
girls
do
take
up
good
works
and
slummin
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
but
not
till
they
are
older
than
you
are
darling
and
then
generally
because
they
have
married
at
least
added
lady
isabel
hurriedly
people
are
sure
to
say
it
is
that
i
do
mind
if
they
do
said
alex
proudly
her
mind
full
of
mother
gertrude
story
well
i
suppose
you
must
do
as
you
like
girls
do
alex
almost
instinctively
uttered
the
cry
that
with
successive
generations
has
passed
from
appeal
to
rebellion
then
to
assertion
and
from
the
defiance
of
that
assertion
to
a
calm
statement
of
facts
is
my
ca
i
live
my
own
life
a
woman
who
does
marry
and
who
has
eccentric
tastes
does
have
much
of
a
life
i
could
never
bear
thinking
of
it
for
any
of
you
alex
was
rather
startled
at
the
sadness
in
her
mother
voice
but
mother
why
lots
of
girls
do
marry
and
just
live
at
home
as
long
as
there
is
a
home
but
things
alter
alex
your
father
and
i
in
the
nature
of
things
ca
go
on
livin
for
ever
and
then
this
house
goes
to
cedric
there
is
no
country
place
as
you
know
your
sold
everything
he
could
lay
his
hands
on
and
we
none
of
us
have
ever
had
enough
ready
money
to
think
of
buyin
even
a
small
place
in
the
country
but
i
thought
we
were
quite
rich
lady
isabel
flushed
delicately
we
are
not
exactly
poor
but
such
money
as
there
is
mostly
came
from
my
father
and
there
will
not
be
much
after
my
death
she
confessed
most
of
it
will
be
money
tied
up
for
archie
poor
little
boy
because
he
is
the
younger
son
and
your
grandfather
thought
that
was
the
proper
way
to
arrange
it
it
was
all
settled
when
you
were
quite
little
children
in
fact
before
pamela
was
born
or
thought
of
and
your
father
naturally
wanted
all
he
could
hope
to
leave
to
go
to
cedric
so
that
he
might
be
able
to
live
on
here
whatever
happened
but
what
about
barbara
and
me
was
it
rather
unfair
to
want
the
boys
to
have
everything
your
father
said
girls
will
marry
of
course
there
will
be
a
certain
sum
for
each
of
you
on
your
but
there
no
question
of
either
of
you
being
able
to
afford
to
remain
unmarried
and
live
decently
you
wo
have
enough
to
make
it
possible
said
lady
isabel
very
simply
but
one
of
us
might
want
to
marry
a
very
poor
man
a
man
in
your
own
rank
of
life
my
dear
child
could
hardly
propose
to
you
unless
he
had
enough
to
support
you
of
course
we
do
wish
either
of
you
to
feel
that
you
must
marry
for
money
ever
but
at
the
same
time
i
think
you
ought
to
be
warned
girls
very
often
go
gaily
on
it
will
be
time
enough
to
settle
later
and
then
something
happens
and
they
find
they
have
no
money
of
their
own
and
perhaps
no
home
left
for
a
few
years
perhaps
it
possible
to
go
on
paying
visits
and
staying
with
other
people
but
it
never
very
pleasant
to
feel
one
has
no
alternative
and
the
sort
of
environment
where
a
man
looks
for
his
wife
is
in
her
own
sheltered
home
said
lady
isabel
with
emphasis
alex
felt
rather
dismayed
though
less
so
than
she
would
have
done
before
her
intimacy
at
the
convent
had
given
her
glimpses
of
another
possible
standard
she
paid
one
more
visit
to
mother
gertrude
before
leaving
london
this
time
she
was
kept
waiting
for
a
while
in
the
parlour
so
that
she
began
to
wish
that
she
had
not
told
holland
to
call
for
her
in
an
time
she
never
dared
stay
any
longer
partly
from
a
vague
impression
that
mother
gertrude
had
a
good
deal
to
do
and
partly
from
a
very
distinct
certainty
that
lady
isabel
always
noted
the
length
of
her
visits
to
the
convent
no
less
than
their
frequency
she
looked
round
the
ugly
room
rather
disconsolately
and
fingered
the
books
on
the
table
they
seemed
very
uninteresting
and
were
mostly
in
french
one
slim
volume
more
attractively
bound
than
the
others
drew
her
attention
for
a
moment
and
she
turned
idly
to
the
notre
mère
fondatrice
esquisse
de
piété
filiale
alex
smiled
at
the
wording
which
she
read
in
the
imperfect
literal
translation
of
an
indifferent
french
scholar
and
turned
to
the
next
leaf
two
photographs
facing
one
another
were
reproduced
on
either
page
the
first
portrait
was
of
a
young
woman
standing
by
a
table
in
a
stiffly
artificial
attitude
with
enormously
wide
skirts
billowing
round
her
decked
with
elaborate
and
to
alex
eyes
meaningless
trimmings
of
some
dark
narrow
ribbon
that
might
have
been
velvet
she
wore
long
dangling
and
her
abundant
plaits
of
dark
hair
were
gathered
into
the
nape
of
her
neck
confined
by
a
net
the
face
turned
over
one
shoulder
was
heavy
rather
than
handsome
with
strongly
marked
features
and
big
sombre
dark
eyes
it
was
with
a
little
thrill
approaching
to
awe
that
alex
recognized
her
again
on
the
next
page
in
the
veil
and
habit
of
the
order
the
girth
of
the
figure
had
increased
and
the
face
showed
traces
of
having
been
heavily
scored
by
the
passing
of
some
twenty
or
thirty
years
but
this
time
the
strong
mouth
was
smiling
frankly
and
the
eyes
had
lost
their
brooding
look
and
were
directed
upwards
with
an
ardent
and
animated
expression
the
hands
so
plump
as
to
show
mere
indents
in
place
of
knuckles
across
their
remarkable
breadth
grasped
a
small
crucifix
under
the
first
portrait
alex
read
the
inscription
angèle
prédoux
a
ans
beneath
the
picture
of
the
nun
angèle
not
very
distinguished
patronymic
had
been
replaced
by
the
title
of
mère
candide
de
sacré
coeur
and
still
supplemented
by
the
announcement
fondatrice
et
supérieure
de
son
ordre
though
the
dress
in
the
photograph
looked
to
alex
eyes
she
was
yet
astonished
that
any
woman
so
nearly
of
her
own
time
should
have
founded
a
religious
order
she
had
always
supposed
vaguely
that
the
educational
variety
of
religious
orders
which
she
knew
flourished
in
europe
had
taken
their
existence
from
the
dominican
or
benedictine
communities
but
it
seemed
now
that
a
new
foundation
might
come
into
being
under
the
auspice
of
so
youthful
and
a
pioneer
as
angèle
prédoux
alex
wondered
how
she
had
set
about
it
a
grotesque
fancy
flitted
through
her
mind
as
to
the
fashion
in
which
sir
francis
and
lady
isabel
might
be
expected
to
receive
an
announcement
that
alex
or
barbara
felt
called
upon
to
found
a
new
religious
order
alex
could
not
help
dismissing
the
imaginary
situation
thus
conjured
up
with
a
slight
shudder
and
the
conviction
that
angèle
prédoux
if
her
position
had
been
in
any
degree
tenable
must
have
been
an
orphan
wishing
all
the
time
that
mother
gertrude
would
come
to
her
she
glanced
through
the
first
few
pages
of
the
book
it
somehow
slightly
amazed
her
to
read
of
the
founder
of
a
religious
order
as
a
little
girl
who
had
like
herself
passed
through
the
successive
phases
of
babyhood
schooldays
and
the
society
of
her
compeers
in
the
world
and
to
what
end
inquired
the
author
of
the
when
angèle
prédoux
had
celebrated
her
birthday
at
a
ball
given
on
her
behalf
by
an
adoring
grandfather
to
what
end
alex
repeated
the
question
to
herself
and
marvelled
rather
vaguely
as
various
replies
floated
through
her
mind
life
all
led
to
something
she
supposed
and
for
the
first
time
it
occurred
to
her
that
she
herself
had
never
aimed
at
anything
save
the
possession
of
that
which
she
called
happiness
what
had
been
angèle
prédoux
aim
what
was
that
of
mother
gertrude
certainly
not
human
happiness
life
was
disappointing
enough
alex
reflected
drearily
one
was
always
waiting
always
looking
forward
to
the
next
stage
as
though
it
must
reveal
the
secret
solution
to
the
great
question
of
thoughts
turned
to
noel
cardew
and
the
sick
misery
and
disappointment
engendered
by
her
engagement
the
door
opened
and
she
sprang
up
oh
i
am
so
glad
you
have
come
at
last
were
you
getting
impatient
i
sorry
but
you
know
our
time
is
not
our
own
the
nun
sat
down
and
alex
flung
rather
than
sat
herself
in
her
favourite
position
on
the
floor
her
arms
resting
on
the
knee
what
is
the
matter
asked
mother
gertrude
what
was
troubling
you
just
before
i
came
in
alex
you
always
know
said
alex
in
quick
passionate
recognition
of
an
intuition
that
it
had
hitherto
been
her
share
to
exercise
on
behalf
of
another
never
to
receive
your
face
is
not
so
very
difficult
to
read
and
i
think
i
know
you
pretty
well
by
this
time
better
than
any
one
said
alex
in
all
good
faith
and
unaware
that
certain
aspects
of
herself
such
as
she
showed
to
barbara
or
to
her
father
and
mother
when
they
angered
or
frightened
her
had
never
yet
been
called
forth
in
the
superior
presence
and
probably
never
would
be
well
what
was
it
was
it
our
mother
foundress
how
did
you
know
gasped
alex
unseeing
of
the
still
open
book
lying
on
the
table
mother
gertrude
did
not
refer
to
it
she
passed
her
hand
slowly
over
the
upturned
head
alex
had
thrown
off
her
hat
i
was
looking
at
the
picture
of
her
it
seemed
so
difficult
to
realize
that
any
one
who
actually
formed
a
new
religious
order
could
live
almost
and
be
a
girl
just
like
myself
god
bestows
his
gifts
where
he
pleases
sometimes
the
call
sounds
where
one
might
least
expect
to
hear
it
in
the
midst
of
the
world
and
worldly
pleasure
sometimes
in
the
midst
of
the
disappointment
and
grief
of
the
world
alex
did
not
speak
but
continued
to
gaze
up
at
the
nun
mother
gertrude
went
on
speaking
slowly
you
see
alex
sometimes
it
is
necessary
for
a
soul
a
loving
and
undisciplined
one
especially
to
learn
the
utter
worthlessness
of
human
love
in
order
that
it
may
turn
and
see
the
divine
love
waiting
for
it
but
all
human
love
is
worthless
said
alex
almost
pleadingly
her
eyes
dilating
surely
a
finite
love
is
worthless
compared
to
an
infinite
said
the
nun
gently
we
can
hardly
imagine
it
alex
with
our
little
limited
understanding
but
there
is
a
love
that
satisfies
the
most
exacting
of
us
asking
indeed
and
yet
willing
to
accept
so
little
and
above
all
giving
with
a
completeness
to
which
no
human
sympathy
however
deep
and
tender
can
ever
attain
alex
heard
only
the
ring
of
utter
conviction
permeating
every
word
uttered
in
that
deep
ardent
voice
and
listening
to
the
mystic
heard
nothing
of
the
fanatic
but
not
every
one
she
stammered
the
nun
did
not
pretend
to
misunderstand
her
many
are
called
she
said
but
few
are
chosen
do
you
want
me
to
tell
you
a
little
of
all
that
is
promised
to
those
who
leave
all
things
for
his
sake
yes
said
alex
her
heart
throbbing
strangely
xvii
looking
back
long
afterwards
to
that
last
week
of
the
brilliant
jubilee
season
in
london
and
to
the
two
months
that
followed
spent
in
a
house
near
windsor
taken
principally
to
gratify
cedric
passion
for
tennis
alex
could
never
remember
whether
the
first
definite
suggestion
of
her
entering
the
religious
life
had
come
from
herself
or
from
mother
gertrude
neither
she
nor
barbara
had
been
taken
to
cowes
that
year
and
the
first
fortnight
spent
at
the
windsor
house
which
stood
in
a
large
rambling
garden
full
of
roses
close
to
the
river
reminded
her
strangely
of
the
summer
holidays
they
had
spent
together
as
children
cedric
very
sunburnt
and
sturdy
played
tennis
with
a
sort
of
concentrated
cumulative
enthusiasm
took
part
in
innumerable
cricket
matches
possessing
already
a
very
real
reputation
in
eton
circles
as
a
promising
slow
bowler
and
a
very
reliable
bat
and
occasionally
took
his
sisters
on
the
river
barbara
on
whom
late
nights
in
london
had
told
slept
half
the
morning
and
then
practised
serves
at
tennis
assiduously
under
her
brother
coaching
while
pamela
already
a
hoyden
romped
screaming
over
the
lawn
in
a
fashion
that
in
alex
and
barbara
nursery
days
would
have
met
with
instant
and
drastic
punishment
but
old
nurse
was
lenient
with
the
last
and
youngest
of
her
charges
and
her
guardianship
was
almost
a
nominal
one
only
alex
was
preoccupied
aimlessly
brooding
over
one
absorbing
interest
as
in
the
summer
holidays
that
the
clare
children
had
spent
at
fiveapples
farm
just
as
then
she
had
waited
and
looked
and
longed
for
queenie
letters
so
now
she
waited
for
those
of
mother
gertrude
day
after
sunlit
day
she
stood
at
the
bottom
of
the
straggling
paddock
that
gave
on
to
the
dusty
and
waited
for
the
afternoon
post
to
be
delivered
she
was
often
disappointed
but
never
with
the
sick
intensity
of
dismay
that
had
marked
every
fresh
stage
in
her
realization
of
queenie
torrance
indifference
to
friendship
mother
gertrude
only
wrote
when
she
could
find
a
little
spare
time
and
left
by
far
the
greater
number
of
alex
daily
outpourings
to
her
unanswered
but
she
read
them
all
she
understood
alex
told
herself
in
a
passion
of
pure
gratitude
and
she
thought
of
her
child
and
prayed
daily
for
her
her
letters
began
my
dearest
child
and
alex
treasured
the
words
and
the
few
earnest
counsels
and
exhortations
that
the
letters
contained
it
was
much
easier
to
carry
out
those
exhortations
at
windsor
than
it
had
been
in
london
alex
went
almost
every
day
to
a
small
catholic
church
of
which
holland
had
discovered
the
vicinity
and
sometimes
spent
the
whole
afternoon
in
the
drowsy
heat
of
the
little
building
that
was
almost
always
empty
her
thoughts
dwelt
vaguely
on
her
own
future
and
on
the
craving
necessity
for
of
which
mother
gertrude
had
made
her
more
intensely
aware
than
she
knew
could
it
be
that
her
many
failures
were
to
prove
only
the
preliminary
to
an
immense
success
predestined
for
her
out
of
eternity
the
allurement
of
the
thought
soothed
alex
with
an
infinite
sweetness
when
sir
francis
and
his
wife
joined
the
windsor
party
lady
isabel
exclaimed
with
satisfaction
at
her
daughters
looks
only
a
fortnight
and
it
done
such
wonders
for
you
both
barbara
was
like
a
little
rag
and
now
she
quite
blooming
you
got
more
colour
too
alex
darling
and
i
so
thankful
to
see
that
you
yourself
rather
better
evidently
country
air
and
quiet
was
what
you
both
needed
nevertheless
lady
isabel
lost
no
time
in
issuing
and
accepting
various
invitations
that
led
to
luncheons
and
occasional
dinners
with
the
innumerable
acquaintances
whom
she
immediately
discovered
to
be
within
walking
or
driving
distance
it
annoyed
alex
unreasonably
that
her
liberty
should
be
interfered
with
thus
by
entertainments
which
afforded
her
no
pleasure
she
ungraciously
conceded
her
place
to
barbara
as
often
as
possible
and
went
off
to
seek
the
solitude
of
the
chapel
with
an
inward
conviction
of
her
own
great
unworldliness
and
spirituality
barbara
showed
plenty
of
eagerness
to
avail
herself
of
the
opportunities
thus
passed
on
to
her
she
had
sedulously
cultivated
a
great
enthusiasm
for
tennis
and
by
dint
of
sheer
hard
practice
had
actually
acquired
a
certain
forceful
skill
making
up
for
a
natural
lack
of
suppleness
that
deprived
her
play
of
any
grace
her
rather
manufactured
displays
of
enjoyment
which
had
none
of
the
spontaneous
vitality
of
little
pamela
noisy
bounding
high
spirits
were
always
in
sufficient
contrast
to
alex
supine
to
render
them
doubly
agreeable
to
sir
francis
and
lady
isabel
i
like
to
take
my
little
daughter
about
and
see
her
enjoying
herself
sir
francis
would
say
with
more
wistfulness
than
pleasure
in
his
voice
sometimes
as
though
wishing
that
barbara
gaiety
could
have
been
allied
to
alex
prettier
face
and
position
as
his
eldest
daughter
it
was
only
in
his
two
sons
cedric
with
his
sort
of
steady
brilliance
and
idle
archie
by
far
the
of
the
clare
children
that
sir
francis
found
unalloyed
satisfaction
pamela
was
the
modern
child
in
embryo
and
disconcerted
more
than
she
pleased
him
it
was
principally
to
gratify
cedric
that
lady
isabel
arranged
a
tennis
tournament
for
the
end
of
the
summer
on
a
hot
day
of
late
september
that
was
to
remain
in
alex
memory
as
a
milestone
unrecognized
at
the
time
marking
the
end
of
an
era
thank
heaven
it
fine
piously
breathed
barbara
at
the
window
in
the
morning
i
shall
wear
my
white
piqué
alex
shrugged
her
shoulders
neither
she
nor
barbara
would
have
dreamed
of
inaugurating
a
new
form
of
toilette
without
previous
reference
to
lady
isabel
and
barbara
small
piece
of
was
merely
designed
to
emphasize
the
butterfly
rôle
which
she
was
embracing
with
so
much
determination
of
course
you
wear
your
piqué
mother
said
so
alex
retorted
conscious
of
childishness
you
worn
a
piqué
at
every
tennis
party
you
been
to
well
this
is
a
new
piqué
said
barbara
who
invariably
found
a
last
word
for
any
discussion
and
she
went
downstairs
singing
in
a
small
tuneful
chirp
made
carefully
careless
who
is
coming
alex
inquired
having
taken
no
part
whatever
in
the
lengthy
discussions
as
to
partners
and
handicaps
which
had
engrossed
cedric
and
barbara
for
the
past
ten
days
cedric
looked
up
frowning
from
the
list
on
which
he
was
still
engaged
he
did
not
speak
however
but
barbara
said
very
sweetly
and
with
an
emphasis
so
nearly
imperceptible
that
only
her
sister
could
appreciate
it
oh
nobody
in
whom
you
at
all
specially
interested
i
afraid
alex
did
not
miss
the
implication
and
coloured
angrily
i
going
to
play
with
that
artist
the
one
staying
with
the
russells
he
is
at
all
a
good
player
said
barbara
smoothly
then
why
are
you
playing
with
him
barbara
smiled
rather
it
would
hardly
do
to
annex
the
best
partners
for
ourselves
would
it
she
inquired
and
we
trying
to
equalize
the
setts
as
far
as
possible
cedric
has
to
play
with
the
youngest
russell
girl
who
too
utterly
hopeless
i
shall
take
all
her
balls
said
cedric
calmly
so
it
be
all
right
she
does
mind
any
amount
of
poaching
we
shall
lose
on
her
serves
of
course
but
that
may
be
just
as
well
why
dear
innocently
inquired
lady
isabel
i
do
think
it
looks
well
to
carry
off
a
prize
at
one
own
show
cedric
said
candidly
i
should
rather
love
the
indian
bangles
owned
barbara
glancing
enviously
at
the
array
of
silver
trifles
that
constituted
the
prizes
you
wo
get
them
my
child
not
with
mcallister
as
your
partner
you
see
lady
essie
cameron
will
get
them
or
one
of
the
nottinghams
if
they
in
good
form
peter
nottingham
is
playing
with
you
alex
barbara
informed
her
that
boy
nottingham
is
nearly
eighteen
let
me
tell
you
said
cedric
in
tones
of
offence
and
plays
an
extraordinarily
good
game
of
tennis
in
fact
he
be
about
the
best
man
there
probably
which
is
why
i
had
to
give
him
to
you
for
a
partner
as
you
not
taken
the
trouble
to
practise
a
single
stroke
the
whole
summer
i
should
advise
you
to
keep
out
of
his
way
and
let
him
stand
up
to
the
net
and
take
every
blessed
thing
he
can
get
it
be
a
nice
thing
for
me
said
cedric
bitterly
to
have
to
apologize
to
nottingham
for
making
him
play
with
the
worst
girl
there
and
that
my
sister
cedric
said
his
mother
gently
i
sure
i
seen
alex
play
very
nicely
alex
was
grateful
but
she
wished
that
like
barbara
she
had
practised
her
strokes
under
cedric
tuition
it
was
characteristic
of
her
that
when
the
occasion
for
excelling
had
actually
come
she
should
passionately
desire
to
excel
whereas
during
previous
weeks
of
supine
indifference
it
had
never
seemed
to
her
worth
while
to
exert
herself
in
the
attainment
of
proficiency
after
breakfast
she
went
out
to
the
freshly
marked
and
rolled
and
wondered
if
it
would
be
worth
while
to
make
archie
send
her
over
some
balls
but
cedric
hurried
up
in
a
way
and
ordered
everybody
off
the
ground
while
he
instructed
the
garden
boy
in
the
science
of
putting
up
a
new
net
alex
moved
disconsolately
away
and
tried
to
tell
herself
that
none
of
these
trivial
useless
enthusiasms
which
they
regarded
so
earnestly
were
of
any
real
importance
she
wandered
down
to
the
chapel
and
sat
there
for
the
most
part
pondering
over
her
own
infinitesimal
chances
of
success
in
the
coming
tournament
and
thinking
how
much
she
would
like
to
astonish
and
disconcert
barbara
and
cedric
by
a
sudden
display
of
skill
it
was
true
that
she
had
not
practised
and
was
at
no
time
a
strong
player
but
she
had
sometimes
shown
an
erratic
brilliance
in
a
sudden
stroke
and
like
all
weak
people
she
had
an
irrational
belief
in
sudden
and
improbable
accessions
of
luck
needless
to
say
this
belief
was
not
justified
peter
nottingham
a
tall
shy
boy
with
a
smashing
service
and
tremendous
length
of
reach
was
intent
on
nothing
but
victory
and
though
he
muttered
politely
not
all
sure
at
alex
preliminary
faltering
announcement
of
her
own
bad
play
the
very
sense
of
his
keenness
made
her
nervous
she
missed
every
stroke
gave
an
aimless
dash
that
just
succeeded
in
stopping
a
ball
that
would
obviously
have
been
out
and
felt
her
nerve
going
just
as
success
always
led
her
on
to
excel
so
failure
reduced
her
capabilities
to
a
minimum
her
heart
sank
they
lost
the
first
game
will
you
serve
enquired
peter
nottingham
politely
i
rather
you
did
alex
was
infinitely
relieved
that
responsibility
should
momentarily
be
off
her
own
shoulders
but
young
nottingham
swift
service
was
as
swiftly
returned
by
lady
essie
cameron
an
excellent
player
and
one
who
had
no
hesitation
in
smashing
the
ball
on
to
the
farthest
corner
of
the
court
where
alex
stood
obviously
nervous
and
unready
she
failed
to
reach
it
and
could
have
cried
with
mortification
thanks
to
nottingham
however
they
won
the
game
it
was
their
solitary
victory
alex
served
one
fault
after
another
and
at
last
ceased
even
to
murmur
perfunctory
apologies
as
she
and
her
partner
whose
boyish
face
expressed
scarlet
vexation
crossed
over
the
court
she
was
not
clear
as
to
the
system
on
which
cedric
had
arranged
the
tournament
but
presently
she
saw
that
the
losing
couples
would
drop
out
one
by
one
until
the
champions
having
won
the
greatest
number
of
setts
would
finally
challenge
any
remaining
couples
whom
they
had
not
yet
encountered
i
say
i
afraid
this
is
pretty
rotten
for
you
old
chap
she
heard
cedric
full
of
concern
say
to
her
partner
perhaps
we
may
get
another
look
in
at
the
finals
said
peter
nottingham
with
gloomy
civility
he
and
alex
with
several
others
sat
and
watched
the
progress
of
the
games
it
gave
alex
a
shock
of
rather
unpleasant
surprise
to
see
the
improvement
in
barbara
play
her
service
an
overhand
one
in
which
very
few
girl
players
were
then
proficient
gave
rise
to
several
compliments
her
partner
was
the
artist
ralph
mcallister
well
played
he
shouted
enthusiastically
again
and
again
once
or
twice
when
barbara
missed
a
stroke
alex
heard
him
exclaim
softly
oh
hard
luck
well
tried
partner
alex
tired
and
mortified
almost
angry
wondered
why
fate
should
have
assigned
to
her
as
a
partner
a
mannerless
young
cub
like
nottingham
who
thought
of
nothing
but
the
horrid
game
it
did
not
occur
to
her
that
perhaps
mcallister
would
not
have
been
moved
to
the
same
enthusiasm
had
she
instead
of
barbara
been
playing
with
him
the
combination
however
was
beaten
by
cedric
and
the
youngest
of
the
russell
girls
a
pretty
roundabout
child
who
left
all
the
play
to
her
partner
and
screamed
with
excitement
and
admiration
almost
every
time
he
hit
the
ball
it
was
quite
evident
that
the
final
contest
lay
between
them
and
lady
essie
cameron
a
strapping
muscular
scotch
girl
whose
partner
kept
discreetly
to
the
background
and
allowed
her
to
stand
up
to
the
net
and
volley
every
possible
ball
that
came
over
when
she
and
her
partner
had
emerged
victorious
from
every
contest
nothing
remained
but
for
cedric
and
miss
russell
to
make
good
their
claim
to
the
second
place
by
conquering
the
remaining
couples
alex
played
worse
than
ever
and
the
sett
was
six
games
to
love
as
she
went
past
cedric
muttered
to
her
low
and
viciously
are
you
doing
it
she
knew
that
he
was
angry
and
mortified
at
his
friend
disappointment
but
his
words
struck
her
like
a
blow
she
stood
with
her
back
to
every
one
gulping
hard
you
did
have
a
chance
old
man
said
a
sympathetic
youth
behind
her
they
might
have
arranged
the
setts
better
peter
nottingham
growled
in
reply
who
was
the
girl
you
were
playing
with
alex
realized
that
her
white
frock
and
plain
straw
hat
were
indistinguishable
from
all
the
other
white
frocks
and
straw
hats
present
seen
from
the
back
hush
said
young
nottingham
more
cautiously
that
was
one
of
the
girls
of
the
house
a
miss
clare
ca
play
a
bit
can
she
the
other
one
was
bad
did
one
of
them
give
poor
cardew
the
chuck
or
something
oh
shut
up
nottingham
rebuked
the
indiscreet
one
much
more
likely
chucked
if
you
ask
me
alex
could
bear
the
risk
of
their
discovering
her
proximity
no
longer
and
hastened
into
the
house
it
was
the
first
afternoon
since
her
arrival
at
windsor
that
she
had
not
looked
eagerly
for
the
afternoon
post
the
letter
a
square
bluish
envelope
of
cheap
glazed
paper
caught
her
eye
almost
accidentally
on
the
table
in
the
hall
she
recognized
it
instantly
and
snatching
it
up
opened
and
read
it
standing
there
with
the
scent
of
a
huge
bowl
of
late
roses
pervading
the
whole
hall
and
the
distant
sound
of
cries
and
laughter
faintly
penetrating
to
her
ears
from
the
and
garden
outside
mother
gertrude
writing
showed
all
the
disciplined
regularity
characteristic
of
a
convent
with
the
conventional
french
slope
and
letters
the
careful
making
of
which
alex
herself
had
had
instilled
into
her
in
belgium
the
phraseology
of
the
superior
letter
was
conventional
too
and
even
her
most
earnest
exhortations
when
delivered
in
writing
bore
the
marks
of
restraint
but
this
letter
was
different
alex
knew
it
at
once
even
before
she
had
read
it
to
the
end
of
the
four
sheets
my
dearest
child
there
are
many
letters
from
you
waiting
to
be
answered
and
i
thank
you
for
them
all
and
for
the
confidence
you
bestow
upon
me
which
touches
me
very
deeply
now
at
last
i
am
able
to
sit
down
and
feel
that
i
shall
have
a
quiet
in
which
to
talk
to
my
child
although
i
dare
not
hope
that
it
will
be
an
uninterrupted
one
so
the
life
you
are
leading
does
not
satisfy
you
alex
you
tell
me
that
you
come
in
from
the
gaieties
and
amusements
and
little
parties
which
after
all
are
natural
to
your
age
and
to
the
position
in
which
god
has
placed
you
full
of
dissatisfaction
and
restlessness
of
mind
alex
my
dear
child
i
am
not
surprised
you
will
never
find
that
what
the
world
can
offer
will
satisfy
you
most
of
us
may
have
known
similar
moments
of
fatigue
of
disillusionment
but
to
a
heart
and
mind
like
yours
above
all
it
is
inconceivable
that
anything
less
than
infinity
itself
should
bring
any
lasting
joy
let
me
say
what
i
have
so
often
thought
after
our
conversations
together
in
my
little
room
there
is
only
one
way
of
peace
for
such
a
nature
as
yours
up
all
and
you
shall
find
i
have
thought
and
prayed
over
this
letter
my
little
alex
and
am
not
writing
lightly
you
will
forgive
me
if
i
am
going
too
far
but
i
long
to
see
my
child
at
rest
and
for
such
as
you
there
is
only
one
true
rest
here
human
love
has
failed
you
and
you
are
left
alone
with
all
your
impulses
of
sacrifice
and
devotion
to
another
thrown
back
upon
yourself
but
alex
there
is
one
to
whom
all
the
love
and
tenderness
of
which
you
know
yourself
capable
can
be
offered
and
he
it
weak
though
you
are
and
though
he
is
he
wants
you
i
do
think
there
has
been
a
day
since
i
first
heard
his
call
when
i
have
not
marvelled
at
the
wonder
of
it
at
the
infinite
honour
done
to
me
if
i
have
told
you
more
of
the
secret
story
of
my
vocation
than
to
any
one
else
it
has
been
for
a
reason
which
i
think
you
have
guessed
i
have
seen
for
a
long
while
what
it
was
that
god
asked
of
you
alex
and
i
believe
the
time
has
come
when
you
will
see
it
too
your
last
letter
with
its
cry
of
loneliness
and
the
bitter
sense
of
being
unwanted
has
made
me
almost
sure
of
it
you
are
not
unwanted
you
need
never
be
lonely
again
all
things
and
follow
me
if
you
hear
that
call
which
i
believe
with
all
my
heart
to
have
sounded
for
you
can
you
disobey
it
will
you
not
rather
forsaking
all
things
follow
him
and
in
so
doing
find
all
things
i
have
written
a
long
while
and
can
not
go
on
now
god
bless
you
again
and
again
and
help
you
to
be
truly
generous
with
him
write
to
me
as
fully
as
you
will
and
count
upon
my
poor
prayers
and
my
most
earnest
religious
affection
i
need
not
add
come
and
see
me
again
on
your
return
to
london
my
child
will
always
find
the
warmest
of
welcomes
it
was
not
for
nothing
that
you
came
into
the
convent
chapel
to
find
rest
and
quiet
that
summer
day
my
alex
your
devoted
mother
in
christ
gertrude
of
the
holy
cross
alex
stood
almost
as
though
transfixed
the
letter
hardly
came
as
a
surprise
she
had
long
since
known
subconsciously
what
was
in
the
superior
mind
and
yet
the
expression
of
it
produced
in
her
a
sort
of
stupefaction
could
it
be
true
was
there
really
such
a
refuge
for
her
somewhere
a
need
of
her
and
of
that
passionate
desire
for
that
was
so
essential
a
part
of
her
the
thought
brought
with
it
a
tingling
admixture
of
bitter
disappointment
and
of
poignant
rapture
she
realized
almost
despairingly
that
she
could
no
longer
stand
in
the
hall
clasping
mother
gertrude
letter
unconsciously
to
her
already
light
flying
feet
were
approaching
from
the
garden
i
came
to
look
for
you
alex
said
barbara
breathlessly
in
the
doorway
they
going
to
give
the
prizes
what
are
you
doing
i
coming
said
alex
mechanically
she
was
rather
surprised
that
barbara
should
have
taken
the
trouble
to
come
for
her
did
mother
send
you
no
said
barbara
simply
but
i
thought
it
would
look
very
bad
if
you
kept
out
of
the
way
of
it
because
you
happened
to
play
badly
and
not
win
a
prize
so
alex
assisted
at
the
and
saw
lady
essie
accept
the
jingling
indian
silver
bangles
that
were
so
much
in
fashion
with
frank
pleasure
and
gratitude
and
saw
consolation
prizes
awarded
to
cedric
and
to
his
partner
who
appeared
entirely
delighted
although
she
had
done
nothing
at
all
to
deserve
distinction
you
ought
to
have
a
prize
you
know
she
heard
ralph
mcallister
tell
barbara
if
you
had
a
better
partner
you
have
won
easily
you
play
much
better
than
lady
essie
really
it
was
not
in
the
least
true
that
barbara
played
better
than
lady
essie
or
nearly
so
well
but
she
put
on
a
little
gratified
complacent
smile
that
apparently
satisfied
ralph
mcallister
quite
as
well
as
modest
disclaimers
alex
kept
out
of
her
partner
way
and
avoided
his
eye
not
much
probability
that
would
address
flattering
speeches
to
her
all
the
time
a
subconscious
emotion
was
surging
through
her
at
the
thought
of
mother
gertrude
letter
and
what
it
contained
the
life
you
are
leading
does
not
satisfy
you
you
will
never
find
that
what
the
world
can
offer
will
satisfy
you
it
was
true
enough
heaven
knew
alex
thought
drearily
as
she
addressed
perfunctory
and
obviously
civilities
to
her
guests
in
the
sense
of
depression
engendered
by
the
afternoon
failure
no
less
than
by
the
sight
of
mcallister
evident
delight
in
demure
alternate
coyness
and
gaiety
alex
realized
both
her
own
eternal
dissatisfaction
with
her
surroundings
and
the
subtle
allurement
of
a
renunciation
that
should
yet
promise
her
all
that
she
most
longed
for
xviii
crisis
when
alex
went
back
to
london
in
the
beginning
of
october
it
was
with
a
sensation
as
though
an
enormous
gulf
of
time
had
been
traversed
between
her
visits
to
the
convent
in
the
hot
arid
summer
days
and
her
return
there
for
one
thing
the
cold
weather
had
set
in
early
and
with
unusual
severity
and
the
sight
of
fires
and
winter
furs
seemed
to
succeed
with
startling
rapidity
to
the
roses
and
at
windsor
in
her
first
greeting
with
mother
gertrude
too
alex
was
strongly
conscious
of
that
indefinable
sensation
of
having
made
some
strange
almost
progress
in
a
direction
of
which
she
was
only
now
becoming
aware
it
frightened
her
when
the
superior
gazing
at
her
with
those
light
steady
eyes
that
now
held
a
depth
of
undisguised
tenderness
spoke
firmly
with
an
implication
that
could
no
longer
be
denied
or
ignored
so
the
great
decision
is
taken
little
alex
and
if
peace
has
not
yet
come
to
you
do
not
feel
dismayed
it
will
come
as
surely
as
i
stand
here
and
tell
you
of
it
but
there
may
be
there
must
be
conflict
first
whether
she
spoke
of
the
conflict
which
alex
foresaw
half
with
dread
and
half
with
exultation
as
inevitable
between
herself
and
her
surroundings
or
of
some
deeper
inward
dissension
in
alex
own
soul
she
could
not
tell
but
there
was
both
joy
and
a
certain
excitement
in
having
her
destiny
so
much
taken
for
granted
and
the
mystical
and
devotional
works
to
which
the
superior
gave
her
free
access
worked
upon
her
imagination
and
dispelled
many
of
her
lingering
doubts
those
which
lay
deepest
in
her
soul
she
never
examined
she
was
almost
though
not
quite
unaware
of
their
existence
and
to
probe
deeper
into
that
faint
underlying
questioning
would
have
seemed
a
disloyalty
equally
to
that
intangible
possession
which
she
had
begun
to
think
of
as
her
vocation
and
to
mother
gertrude
the
sense
of
closer
companionship
of
a
more
intimate
spiritual
union
expressed
though
never
explicitly
so
in
words
in
her
relation
with
the
superior
was
unutterably
precious
to
alex
in
the
joy
that
it
brought
her
she
read
merely
another
manifestation
and
the
consolation
to
be
found
in
the
way
of
the
spirit
a
feeling
of
impending
crisis
however
hung
over
the
hurrying
days
of
that
brief
november
when
the
convent
parlour
in
the
afternoons
was
illuminated
by
a
single
that
cast
strange
shadows
on
the
walls
just
before
christmas
sir
francis
spoke
what
is
this
violent
attraction
that
takes
you
out
with
your
maid
in
the
opposite
direction
to
your
mother
expeditions
with
barbara
he
suddenly
inquired
of
alex
one
evening
very
stiffly
she
started
and
coloured
having
retained
all
the
childish
uneasy
belief
that
her
father
lived
in
an
atmosphere
far
above
that
into
which
the
sound
and
sight
of
his
children
daily
doings
could
penetrate
to
his
knowledge
without
the
special
intervention
of
some
accredited
emissary
such
as
their
mother
as
he
spoke
lady
isabel
looked
up
and
barbara
left
the
piano
and
came
slowly
down
the
room
has
flashed
through
alex
mind
she
only
said
very
lamely
i
i
do
know
what
you
mean
father
there
was
all
the
shifting
uneasiness
in
her
manner
that
sir
francis
most
disliked
oh
darling
do
prevaricate
hastily
broke
in
lady
isabel
with
an
obvious
uneasiness
that
gave
the
impression
of
being
rooted
in
something
deeper
and
of
longer
standing
than
the
atmosphere
of
disturbance
momentarily
created
but
you
did
not
want
me
to
come
with
you
and
barbara
to
the
stores
this
afternoon
said
alex
cravenly
the
instinct
of
evading
the
direct
issue
was
so
strongly
implanted
in
her
that
she
was
prepared
to
have
recourse
to
the
feeblest
and
least
convincing
of
subterfuges
in
order
to
gain
time
of
course
i
do
want
you
to
come
when
it
all
so
obviously
bores
you
plaintively
said
lady
isabel
i
have
almost
given
up
trying
to
take
you
anywhere
alex
as
you
very
well
know
you
evidently
prefer
to
go
and
sit
in
a
little
stuffy
somewhere
with
heaven
knows
whom
sooner
than
remain
in
the
company
of
your
mother
and
sister
alex
felt
too
much
dismayed
and
unwillingly
convicted
to
make
any
reply
but
after
a
momentary
silence
sir
francis
spoke
ominously
indeed
is
that
so
the
suspicion
that
had
laid
dormant
in
alex
for
a
long
time
woke
to
life
her
father
disappointment
in
her
none
the
less
keenly
felt
because
inarticulate
had
become
merged
into
a
far
greater
bitterness
that
of
his
resentment
on
behalf
of
his
wife
a
personal
grievance
he
might
overlook
though
once
perceived
he
would
never
forget
it
but
where
lady
isabel
due
was
concerned
her
husband
was
capable
of
implacability
and
may
one
inquire
whose
is
the
society
which
you
find
so
preferable
to
that
of
your
family
he
asked
her
with
the
manifest
sarcasm
that
in
him
denoted
the
extreme
of
anger
alex
was
constitutionally
so
much
terrified
of
disapproval
that
it
produced
in
her
a
veritable
physical
inability
to
explain
herself
she
cast
an
agonized
look
around
her
her
mother
was
leaning
back
her
face
strained
and
tired
and
would
not
meet
her
eye
sir
francis
she
knew
without
daring
to
look
at
him
was
swinging
his
to
and
fro
with
a
measured
regularity
that
indicated
his
determination
to
wait
inexorably
and
for
any
length
of
time
for
a
reply
to
his
inquiry
barbara
big
alert
eyes
moved
from
one
member
of
the
group
to
another
acute
and
full
of
appraisement
of
them
all
alex
flung
a
wordless
appeal
to
her
sister
barbara
did
not
fail
to
receive
and
understand
it
and
after
a
moment
she
spoke
alex
goes
to
see
the
superior
of
that
convent
near
bryanston
square
she
made
friends
with
her
in
the
summer
did
you
alex
yes
faltered
alex
some
instinct
of
trying
to
palliate
what
she
felt
would
be
looked
upon
as
undesirable
made
her
add
in
feeble
extenuation
it
is
a
house
of
the
same
order
as
the
liège
one
where
i
was
at
school
you
know
your
devotion
to
it
was
not
so
marked
in
those
days
if
i
remember
right
said
her
father
in
the
same
rather
elaborately
sarcastic
strain
lady
isabel
no
less
uneasy
under
it
than
was
alex
herself
broke
in
with
nervous
exasperation
in
her
every
intonation
oh
francis
it
is
the
same
old
story
one
of
those
foolish
infatuations
you
know
what
she
has
always
been
like
and
how
worried
i
was
about
that
dreadful
torrance
girl
it
this
nun
now
i
suppose
who
is
this
woman
how
should
i
know
helplessly
said
lady
isabel
alex
the
superior
the
head
of
the
house
alex
stopped
how
could
one
say
mother
gertrude
of
the
holy
cross
she
did
not
even
know
what
the
superior
name
in
the
world
had
been
or
where
she
came
from
go
on
said
sir
francis
inexorably
they
were
all
looking
at
her
and
sheer
desperation
came
to
her
help
why
should
i
have
friends
what
is
all
this
about
alex
asked
wildly
it
my
own
life
i
do
want
to
be
undutiful
but
why
ca
i
live
my
own
life
everything
i
ever
do
is
wrong
and
i
know
you
and
father
are
disappointed
in
me
but
i
do
know
how
to
be
different
i
wish
i
did
she
was
crying
bitterly
now
you
wanted
me
to
marry
noel
and
i
would
have
if
i
could
but
i
knew
that
it
would
all
have
been
wrong
and
we
should
have
made
each
other
miserable
only
when
i
did
break
it
off
it
all
seemed
wrong
and
heartless
and
i
do
know
to
do
she
felt
herself
becoming
incoherent
and
the
tension
of
the
atmosphere
grew
almost
unbearable
sir
francis
clare
spoke
true
to
the
traditions
of
his
day
viewing
with
something
very
much
like
horror
the
breaking
down
of
those
defences
of
a
conventional
reserve
that
should
lay
bare
the
undisciplined
emotions
of
the
soul
you
have
said
enough
alex
there
are
certain
things
that
we
do
not
put
into
words
you
are
unhappy
my
child
you
have
said
so
yourself
and
it
has
been
sufficiently
obvious
for
some
time
but
what
is
it
that
you
want
alex
what
would
make
you
happy
her
mother
broke
in
piteously
enough
in
the
face
of
their
perplexity
alex
lost
the
last
feeble
clue
to
her
own
complexity
she
did
not
know
what
she
wanted
to
make
them
happy
to
be
happy
herself
to
be
adored
and
admired
and
radiantly
successful
never
to
know
loneliness
or
misunderstanding
again
such
thoughts
surged
chaotically
through
her
mind
as
she
stood
there
sobbing
and
could
find
no
words
except
the
childish
foolish
formula
i
do
know
she
saw
barbara
eager
protesting
gaze
flash
upon
her
and
heard
her
exclamation
of
wondering
contempt
sir
francis
turned
to
his
younger
daughter
almost
as
though
seeking
elucidation
from
her
obvious
certainties
her
crude
assurance
with
life
oh
said
little
barbara
her
hands
clenched
they
ask
you
what
you
want
what
would
make
you
happy
they
are
practically
offering
you
anything
you
want
in
the
world
you
could
choose
anything
and
you
stand
there
and
cry
and
say
you
do
know
oh
alex
you
hush
said
sir
francis
shocked
and
lady
isabel
put
out
her
white
hand
with
its
glittering
weight
of
rings
and
laid
it
gently
on
shoulder
and
she
too
said
hush
darling
why
are
you
so
vehement
you
happy
are
you
barbara
of
course
said
barbara
wriggling
only
if
you
and
father
asked
me
what
would
like
and
i
had
only
to
say
what
i
wanted
i
could
think
of
such
millions
of
things
for
us
to
have
a
house
in
the
country
and
to
give
a
real
proper
big
ball
next
year
and
for
you
to
let
me
go
to
restaurant
dinners
sometimes
and
not
only
those
dull
parties
and
heaps
of
things
like
that
it
such
an
and
alex
is
wasting
it
all
the
only
thing
she
wants
is
to
sit
and
talk
and
talk
and
talk
with
some
dull
old
nun
at
that
convent
long
afterwards
alex
was
to
remember
and
ponder
over
again
and
again
that
denunciation
of
barbara
it
was
all
fact
was
it
all
true
was
that
what
she
was
fighting
for
that
the
goal
of
her
vehement
inchoate
rebellion
had
she
sought
in
mother
gertrude
society
the
relief
of
only
or
was
her
infatuation
for
the
nun
the
channel
through
which
she
hoped
to
find
those
abstract
possessions
of
the
spirit
which
might
constitute
the
happiness
she
craved
nothing
of
all
the
questionings
that
were
to
come
later
invaded
her
mind
as
she
stood
sobbing
and
at
the
crises
of
her
relations
with
her
childhood
home
do
cry
so
alex
darlin
lady
isabel
sank
back
into
her
armchair
do
cry
like
that
it
so
bad
for
you
and
i
ca
bear
it
we
only
want
to
know
how
we
can
make
you
happier
than
you
are
it
so
dreadful
alex
you
got
everything
i
should
have
thought
a
home
and
parents
who
love
you
it
is
every
girl
that
has
a
father
like
yours
some
of
them
care
nothing
for
their
daughters
and
you
young
and
pretty
and
with
good
health
you
might
have
such
a
perfect
time
even
if
you
made
a
mistake
poor
little
thing
there
be
other
people
alex
you
know
better
another
time
only
i
ca
bear
it
if
you
lose
all
your
looks
by
frettin
and
refusin
to
go
anywhere
and
every
one
asks
me
where
my
eldest
daughter
is
and
why
she
does
make
more
friends
and
enjoy
things
lady
isabel
voice
trailed
away
she
looked
unutterably
tired
they
had
none
of
them
heard
so
emotional
a
ring
in
her
voice
ever
before
sir
francis
looked
down
at
his
wife
in
silence
and
his
gaze
was
as
tender
as
his
voice
was
stern
when
he
finally
spoke
this
can
not
go
on
you
have
done
everything
to
please
alex
to
try
and
make
her
happy
and
it
has
all
been
of
no
use
let
her
take
her
own
way
we
have
failed
no
almost
shrieked
alex
what
do
you
mean
we
have
your
own
word
for
it
and
your
sister
that
you
are
not
happy
at
home
and
infinitely
prefer
the
society
of
some
woman
of
whom
we
know
nothing
in
surroundings
which
i
should
have
thought
would
have
proved
highly
uncongenial
to
one
of
my
daughters
brought
up
among
people
but
apparently
i
am
mistaken
it
is
the
modern
way
i
am
told
a
young
girl
uses
her
father
house
to
shelter
and
feed
her
and
seeks
her
own
friends
and
her
own
interests
the
while
with
no
reference
to
her
parents
wishes
but
not
in
this
case
alex
i
have
your
mother
and
your
sisters
to
consider
your
folly
is
embittering
the
home
life
that
might
be
so
happy
and
pleasant
for
all
of
us
look
at
your
mother
lady
isabel
was
in
tears
what
shall
i
do
said
alex
wildly
let
me
go
right
away
and
not
spoil
things
any
more
you
have
said
it
replied
sir
francis
gravely
and
inclined
his
head
francis
what
are
you
tellin
her
how
can
she
go
away
from
us
her
home
until
she
marries
lady
isabel
voice
was
full
of
distressed
perplexity
my
dear
love
do
do
agitate
yourself
this
is
her
home
as
you
say
and
is
always
open
to
her
but
until
she
has
learnt
to
be
happy
there
let
her
seek
these
new
friends
whom
she
so
infinitely
prefers
let
her
go
to
this
nun
alex
at
his
words
felt
a
rush
of
longing
for
the
tenderness
the
grave
understanding
of
mother
gertrude
the
atmosphere
of
the
quiet
convent
parlour
where
she
had
never
heard
reproach
or
accusation
oh
yes
let
me
go
there
she
sobbed
childishly
i
try
and
be
good
there
i
come
back
good
indeed
i
will
barbara
little
cool
voice
cut
across
her
sobs
how
can
you
go
there
will
they
let
you
stay
what
will
every
one
think
so
many
girls
take
up
slumming
and
good
works
said
lady
isabel
wearily
every
one
knows
she
been
upset
and
unhappy
for
a
long
while
it
may
be
the
best
plan
my
poor
darling
when
you
tired
of
it
you
can
come
back
and
we
try
again
there
was
no
reproach
at
all
in
her
voice
now
only
exhaustion
and
a
sort
of
relief
at
having
reached
a
conclusion
you
hear
what
your
mother
says
if
her
angelic
love
and
patience
do
not
touch
you
alex
you
must
indeed
be
heartless
make
your
arrangements
and
remember
my
poor
child
that
as
long
as
her
arms
remain
open
to
you
i
will
receive
you
home
again
with
love
and
patience
and
without
one
word
of
reproach
he
opened
the
door
for
lady
isabel
and
followed
slowly
from
the
room
his
head
shaking
a
little
alex
flung
herself
down
and
barbara
laid
her
hand
half
timidly
on
her
sister
in
one
of
her
rare
caresses
do
cry
alex
are
you
really
going
it
much
the
best
idea
of
course
and
by
the
time
you
come
back
they
may
have
something
else
to
think
about
she
giggled
a
little
and
waited
as
though
to
be
questioned
i
might
be
engaged
to
be
married
or
something
like
that
and
then
you
come
back
to
be
my
bridesmaid
and
no
one
would
think
of
anything
unhappy
alex
made
no
answer
her
tears
had
exhausted
her
and
she
felt
weak
and
tired
how
are
you
going
to
settle
it
all
pursued
barbara
tirelessly
had
you
better
write
to
them
and
see
if
they
have
you
supposing
mother
gertrude
said
you
could
go
there
a
pang
of
terror
shot
through
alex
at
the
thought
oh
no
no
she
wo
say
she
could
have
me
she
went
blindly
to
the
carved
with
its
heavy
gilt
and
appointments
and
drew
a
sheet
of
paper
towards
her
barbara
stood
watching
her
curiously
feeling
as
though
the
power
of
consecutive
thought
had
almost
left
her
alex
scrawled
a
few
words
and
addressed
them
to
the
superior
we
can
send
it
round
by
hand
said
barbara
coolly
then
you
know
tonight
alex
looked
utterly
bewildered
it
quite
early
holland
can
go
in
a
cab
barbara
rang
the
bell
importantly
and
gave
her
instructions
in
a
small
hard
voice
it
no
use
just
waiting
about
for
days
and
days
she
said
to
alex
it
makes
the
whole
house
feel
horrid
and
father
is
so
grave
and
sarcastic
at
meals
and
it
makes
mother
you
much
rather
be
there
than
here
would
you
alex
alex
thought
again
of
the
superior
welcome
which
had
never
failed
her
the
superior
who
knew
nothing
of
her
wicked
ingratitude
and
undutifulness
at
home
and
repeated
miserably
yes
yes
i
much
rather
be
there
than
here
the
answer
to
the
note
came
much
more
quickly
than
they
had
expected
it
barbara
heard
the
cab
stop
in
the
square
outside
and
ran
down
into
the
hall
she
came
back
in
a
moment
with
a
small
twisted
note
what
does
it
say
alex
alex
read
the
tiny
missive
and
a
great
throb
of
purest
relief
and
comfort
went
through
her
i
may
go
at
once
she
is
waiting
for
me
now
this
minute
if
i
like
what
did
i
tell
you
cried
barbara
triumphantly
she
looked
sharply
at
her
sister
who
was
unconsciously
clasping
the
little
note
as
though
she
derived
positive
consolation
from
the
contact
she
went
to
the
door
holland
is
the
cab
still
there
yes
miss
barbara
why
do
you
go
back
in
it
now
alex
tonight
why
not
she
says
she
waiting
for
you
and
it
would
all
be
much
easier
than
a
lot
of
and
things
with
father
and
mother
i
could
go
without
telling
them
i
tell
them
alex
felt
no
strength
only
a
longing
for
quiet
and
for
mother
gertrude
ask
if
i
may
she
said
faintly
barbara
darted
out
of
the
room
when
she
came
back
alex
heard
her
giving
orders
to
holland
to
pack
a
with
things
for
the
night
then
she
hurried
into
the
room
again
they
said
yes
she
announced
i
think
they
agree
with
me
that
much
the
best
thing
to
do
it
at
once
after
all
you
only
going
for
a
little
visit
mother
said
i
was
to
give
you
her
love
she
lying
down
shall
i
go
in
to
her
you
better
not
father
there
too
i
told
holland
to
pack
your
bag
we
can
send
the
other
things
tomorrow
but
i
sha
want
much
it
only
for
a
little
while
yes
that
all
is
it
said
barbara
quickly
it
only
for
a
little
while
shall
i
fetch
your
things
alex
alex
was
relieved
to
be
spared
the
ascent
to
the
top
of
the
house
for
which
her
limbs
felt
far
too
weary
she
sat
and
looked
round
her
at
the
big
double
crowded
with
heavy
victorian
furniture
and
upholstered
in
yellow
brocaded
satin
she
had
always
thought
it
a
beautiful
room
and
the
recollection
of
its
splendour
and
of
the
big
pictures
and
mirrors
that
hung
round
its
wall
was
mingled
with
the
earliest
memories
of
her
nursery
days
here
you
are
said
barbara
i
brought
your
fur
boa
too
because
it
sure
to
be
cold
holland
has
got
your
bag
without
a
word
alex
rose
and
they
went
down
the
broad
staircase
i
hope
it
be
nice
said
barbara
cheerfully
it
very
brave
of
you
to
go
i
think
alex
and
you
write
and
tell
me
all
about
it
and
how
you
like
poor
people
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
alex
realized
that
her
sister
was
talking
for
the
benefit
of
the
servants
there
was
a
rush
of
icy
wind
as
the
front
door
was
opened
gracious
what
a
night
barbara
retreated
to
the
stairs
again
alex
let
me
know
what
things
you
want
sent
on
said
alex
apathetic
from
fatigue
she
turned
and
waved
her
hand
once
to
barbara
a
slim
alert
little
figure
clinging
to
the
great
carved
foot
of
the
balustrade
the
casting
a
radiance
over
her
light
hair
and
gleaming
fitfully
over
the
shining
steel
buckles
on
her
pointed
shoes
alex
hurried
through
the
cold
evening
to
the
shelter
of
the
cab
it
jolted
slowly
through
the
lighted
streets
and
she
leant
back
her
eyes
closed
a
wave
of
sick
apprehension
surged
over
her
every
now
and
then
and
she
shivered
spasmodically
under
her
fur
here
we
are
miss
shall
i
get
out
and
ring
so
that
you
wo
have
to
wait
in
this
cold
said
the
maid
compassionately
from
the
dark
corner
of
the
cab
alex
watched
the
trim
figure
mount
the
steps
there
was
always
a
long
wait
before
the
convent
door
was
opened
but
tonight
it
was
flung
back
and
warm
light
streamed
out
alex
cold
and
frightened
stumbled
up
the
steps
in
her
turn
it
was
not
the
old
portress
who
had
thrown
back
the
open
door
the
superior
was
waiting
her
hands
outstretched
my
child
my
child
come
in
welcome
home
book
ii
xix
belgium
sister
alexandra
i
have
put
a
letter
in
your
cell
and
will
you
go
to
mother
gertrude
room
after
vespers
thank
you
sister
i
wonder
if
mother
gertrude
remembers
that
i
have
to
go
down
to
the
children
at
five
though
oh
i
dare
say
not
perhaps
you
could
get
some
one
to
replace
you
there
shall
i
see
if
sister
agnes
is
free
thank
you
i
will
speak
to
mother
gertrude
first
the
nuns
separated
the
returning
to
her
eternal
task
of
polishing
up
the
brasses
and
gilt
candlesticks
of
the
chapel
perpetually
dimmed
by
the
rain
and
mists
of
the
belgian
climate
and
alexandra
clare
professed
religious
wearily
mounted
the
steep
narrow
stairs
to
the
tiny
cubicle
in
the
large
dormitory
designated
a
cell
there
would
just
be
time
to
fetch
the
letter
and
put
it
into
the
deep
pocket
of
her
habit
before
the
bell
rang
for
vespers
otherwise
they
would
have
to
wait
till
next
morning
for
she
knew
there
would
be
no
spare
instant
for
even
a
momentary
return
to
the
cell
until
she
went
to
bed
that
night
far
too
tired
for
anything
but
such
rest
as
her
could
afford
she
felt
little
or
no
curiosity
as
to
her
correspondence
nobody
wrote
to
her
except
barbara
who
had
kept
her
posted
in
all
the
general
family
news
with
fair
regularity
for
the
past
nine
years
she
recognized
without
elation
the
narrow
envelope
with
the
thin
black
edge
affected
by
barbara
ever
since
she
had
become
the
widow
of
ralph
mcallister
during
the
course
of
the
war
in
south
africa
it
all
seemed
to
her
very
remote
the
fact
that
mother
gertrude
had
sent
for
her
after
vespers
was
of
far
more
importance
than
any
news
that
barbara
might
have
to
give
of
the
outside
world
that
seemed
so
far
away
and
unreal
sister
alexandra
had
not
been
very
greatly
moved
by
any
echoes
from
without
since
the
sudden
shock
of
hearing
of
her
mother
death
while
she
herself
was
still
a
novice
preparing
to
take
final
vows
alex
still
remembered
the
bewilderment
of
seeing
a
sobbing
schoolgirl
pamela
in
the
parlour
and
the
frozen
rigidity
of
grief
which
had
masked
her
father
anguish
barbara
and
ralph
mcallister
had
been
recalled
from
their
honeymoon
he
still
rapturous
at
a
marriage
which
had
been
deferred
for
nearly
two
years
owing
to
sir
francis
objection
to
his
profession
and
barbara
drowned
in
decorous
tears
through
which
shone
all
the
glory
of
her
and
her
new
position
as
a
married
woman
alex
had
been
thankful
when
those
trying
interviews
had
come
to
an
end
she
had
been
sent
to
liège
just
before
her
religious
profession
it
had
mitigated
the
wrench
of
a
separation
from
her
superior
although
the
first
months
spent
away
from
mother
gertrude
had
seemed
to
her
unutterably
long
and
dreary
but
less
than
a
year
later
mother
gertrude
had
come
to
the
as
assistant
superior
and
the
intercourse
between
them
had
been
as
unbroken
as
the
rule
permitted
it
was
eight
years
since
alex
had
left
england
but
except
for
the
extreme
cold
of
the
winter
which
told
upon
her
health
yearly
she
had
grown
to
be
quite
unaware
of
the
surroundings
outside
the
wave
of
rather
febrile
patriotism
that
rolled
over
england
at
the
time
of
the
boer
war
left
her
quite
untouched
and
no
description
of
conveyed
anything
to
her
mind
of
the
astoundingly
wholesale
demolition
of
old
ideals
that
fell
with
the
death
of
victoria
and
the
succession
of
edward
vii
to
the
english
throne
for
alex
there
was
no
change
except
the
unseen
progress
of
time
itself
she
only
realized
how
far
apart
she
had
grown
from
the
old
life
when
the
news
of
her
father
death
reached
her
in
the
winter
of
and
woke
in
her
only
a
plaintive
pity
and
wonder
at
her
own
absence
of
any
acute
emotion
no
one
came
to
see
her
in
the
parlour
after
sir
francis
death
for
one
thing
she
was
in
belgium
and
too
far
away
to
be
easily
visited
and
the
south
african
casualties
amongst
whom
had
numbered
barbara
young
husband
had
familiarized
them
all
with
the
ideas
of
death
and
parting
so
that
there
was
little
of
the
consternation
and
shock
that
lady
isabel
death
had
brought
to
her
children
the
house
in
clevedon
square
knew
no
more
big
receptions
and
elaborate
at
home
days
but
cedric
already
of
age
had
taken
over
the
headship
of
the
household
and
alex
had
been
conscious
of
a
vague
relief
that
she
could
still
picture
the
surroundings
she
remembered
as
home
for
the
boys
and
pamela
even
that
picture
had
become
dim
and
strangely
elusive
three
years
later
at
the
thought
of
cedric
marriage
alex
had
accepted
it
however
as
she
accepted
most
things
now
with
a
passivity
that
carried
no
conviction
to
her
mind
what
her
outer
knowledge
told
her
was
true
failed
to
impress
itself
in
any
way
upon
her
imagination
and
consequently
left
her
feelings
quite
untouched
to
her
inner
vision
the
life
outside
remained
exactly
as
she
had
last
seen
it
in
that
summer
that
she
still
thought
of
as
diamond
jubilee
year
inside
the
convent
things
had
not
changed
looking
back
she
could
remember
a
faint
feeling
of
amusement
when
she
had
returned
to
the
house
at
liège
at
years
old
believing
herself
to
be
immeasurably
advanced
in
years
and
experience
since
her
schooldays
and
had
found
that
scarcely
any
alteration
or
modification
in
the
convent
had
taken
place
she
now
sat
among
the
other
nuns
at
the
monthly
and
watched
the
girls
rise
one
by
one
in
their
places
their
hands
concealed
under
the
ugly
pèlerine
their
hair
tightly
and
unbecomingly
strained
back
their
young
faces
demurely
made
heavy
and
impassive
as
they
listened
to
the
record
read
aloud
just
as
unrelentingly
as
ever
by
old
mère
alphonsine
sister
alexandra
very
rarely
contributed
any
words
of
praise
or
blame
to
the
judgment
at
first
she
had
been
young
and
therefore
not
expected
to
raise
her
voice
amongst
the
many
dignitaries
present
but
even
now
when
by
convent
standards
she
had
attained
to
the
maturity
of
middle
age
her
opinion
would
have
been
of
little
value
she
was
seldom
sent
among
the
children
although
she
gave
an
english
lesson
to
the
on
two
evenings
a
week
in
her
first
year
at
liège
there
had
been
an
american
girl
of
fourteen
who
had
taken
a
sudden
rapturous
liking
to
her
which
had
never
proceeded
beyond
the
initial
stages
since
alex
without
explanation
had
merely
been
told
to
hand
over
the
charge
of
the
child
english
and
french
lessons
hitherto
in
her
hands
and
had
herself
been
transferred
to
other
duties
since
then
she
had
been
kept
on
the
community
side
of
the
house
and
employed
principally
by
mother
gertrude
to
assist
with
the
enormous
task
of
correspondence
that
fell
to
the
share
of
the
assistant
superior
she
was
taught
to
sew
and
a
large
amount
of
mending
passed
through
her
hands
and
was
badly
accomplished
for
lady
isabel
clare
daughter
had
learned
little
that
could
be
of
use
to
her
in
the
life
she
had
selected
she
was
not
even
sufficiently
musical
to
give
lessons
in
piano
or
organ
playing
nor
had
she
any
of
the
artistic
talent
that
might
be
utilized
for
the
perpetration
of
the
various
pious
that
adorned
the
walls
of
the
parlours
or
the
nevertheless
sister
alexandra
was
no
one
was
ever
anything
else
at
the
convent
where
the
chanting
of
the
daily
office
alone
was
a
very
considerable
physical
strain
both
in
the
raw
cold
of
the
early
morning
and
at
the
dose
of
the
ceaselessly
occupied
day
many
of
the
nuns
said
the
office
apart
owing
to
the
numerous
duties
that
called
them
from
the
chapel
during
the
hours
of
praise
and
supplication
but
sister
alexandra
had
so
few
outside
calls
upon
her
time
that
she
was
one
of
the
most
regular
in
attendance
at
first
her
health
had
appeared
to
improve
under
the
extreme
regularity
of
the
life
and
later
when
her
final
vows
had
been
made
it
was
no
longer
a
subject
for
speculation
she
was
not
ill
and
therefore
need
never
reproach
herself
with
being
a
burden
to
her
community
anything
else
did
not
matter
one
was
tired
no
doubt
but
one
had
made
the
sacrifice
of
one
life
thus
the
conventual
creed
time
had
sped
by
with
strange
monotonous
unperceived
rapidity
it
was
all
a
matter
of
waiting
for
the
next
thing
at
first
alex
clare
had
waited
eagerly
and
nervously
to
be
taught
some
mysterious
secret
that
would
enable
her
to
become
miraculously
happy
and
good
at
home
in
clevedon
square
then
she
had
gradually
come
to
see
that
there
would
be
no
return
that
her
home
thenceforward
would
be
with
mother
gertrude
and
in
the
convent
her
novitiate
days
had
come
next
strange
trying
apprenticeship
that
had
been
lightened
and
comforted
by
the
woman
whose
powerful
and
magnetic
personality
had
never
failed
to
assert
itself
and
its
strength
belgium
and
the
anguished
waiting
and
hoping
for
orders
to
return
to
london
and
the
growing
certainty
that
those
orders
would
not
come
had
culminated
in
the
rush
of
relief
and
joy
that
heralded
mother
unexpected
transfer
to
the
after
that
her
first
vows
taken
for
a
term
of
two
years
had
inaugurated
the
long
probationary
period
at
the
end
of
which
a
final
and
irrevocable
pledge
would
bind
her
for
ever
to
the
way
of
the
chosen
few
those
perpetual
vows
were
held
out
to
her
as
the
goal
and
crown
of
life
itself
and
her
mind
had
speculated
not
at
all
on
what
should
follow
she
was
before
she
was
allowed
to
become
a
professed
religious
according
to
conventual
standards
no
longer
a
very
young
woman
the
delay
had
inflamed
her
ardour
very
much
it
was
characteristic
of
alex
to
believe
implicitly
in
an
overwhelming
transformation
which
should
take
place
within
her
by
virtue
of
one
definite
act
so
long
anticipated
as
to
have
acquired
the
proportions
of
a
miracle
it
sometimes
seemed
to
her
that
ever
since
the
embracing
of
those
perpetual
vows
she
had
lived
on
waiting
for
the
transformation
to
operate
there
was
nothing
else
to
wait
for
the
supreme
act
in
the
life
of
a
religious
to
the
accomplishment
of
which
her
whole
being
had
hitherto
been
tending
impelled
at
once
by
precept
and
by
example
had
taken
place
the
next
initiation
could
only
be
obtained
through
death
itself
yet
alex
was
still
waiting
she
would
tell
herself
that
she
was
waiting
for
the
children
summer
holidays
for
the
beginning
of
the
new
term
then
for
the
season
of
advent
and
the
christmas
festival
for
the
long
stretch
of
lenten
weeks
with
its
additional
fastings
and
fatigue
and
still
as
each
year
slipped
by
the
sense
of
unfulfilment
remained
with
her
dormant
but
occasionally
stirring
in
the
last
four
years
she
had
become
additionally
sensible
of
a
growing
exhaustion
that
seemed
to
sap
her
spirit
no
less
than
the
strength
of
her
body
she
had
waited
for
her
weariness
to
culminate
in
a
breakdown
of
strength
that
should
send
her
to
the
convent
infirmary
when
the
rest
that
her
body
craved
would
be
imposed
upon
her
as
an
obligation
but
no
such
relief
came
to
her
it
sometimes
struck
her
with
a
feeling
of
wonder
that
such
utter
lassitude
of
flesh
and
spirit
alike
could
continue
with
no
apparent
and
drastic
effect
upon
her
powers
of
following
the
daily
rule
but
she
had
no
time
in
which
to
think
for
the
most
part
and
the
example
of
mother
gertrude
unflagging
energy
could
always
shame
her
into
her
devotion
to
the
elder
nun
had
inevitably
increased
by
the
very
restrictions
that
the
convent
rules
placed
upon
their
intercourse
even
now
after
so
many
years
spent
beneath
the
same
roof
the
thought
that
she
was
summoned
to
a
private
interview
with
mother
gertrude
could
still
make
her
heart
beat
faster
since
the
days
of
her
novitiate
there
had
been
few
such
opportunities
and
those
for
the
most
part
hurried
and
interrupted
sister
alexandra
went
downstairs
with
a
lightened
heart
the
bell
from
the
chapel
rang
out
its
daily
summons
and
she
mechanically
took
off
her
apron
folded
and
put
it
away
and
turned
her
steps
down
the
long
passage
her
hands
were
folded
under
her
long
sleeves
and
her
head
bent
beneath
her
veil
in
the
attitude
prescribed
barbara
letter
lay
in
the
depths
of
her
pocket
already
forgotten
her
thoughts
had
flown
ahead
and
she
was
hoping
that
the
superior
would
allow
her
to
send
sister
agnes
in
her
stead
to
the
children
at
five
in
the
chapel
she
raised
her
eyes
furtively
to
the
big
carved
stall
on
a
raised
daïs
where
the
assistant
superior
had
her
place
during
the
frequent
absence
of
the
mother
gertrude
was
very
often
claimed
in
the
parlour
or
elsewhere
even
during
the
hours
of
recital
of
the
office
and
alex
was
always
aware
of
a
faint
but
perceptible
pang
of
jealousy
when
this
was
the
case
tonight
however
the
stately
figure
was
present
she
was
always
upright
and
immovable
and
her
eyes
were
always
downcast
to
her
book
alex
went
through
the
psalms
chanted
on
the
accustomed
single
high
note
and
was
hardly
conscious
of
a
word
she
uttered
long
repetition
had
very
soon
dulled
her
appreciation
of
the
words
and
her
understanding
of
even
church
latin
had
never
been
more
than
superficial
she
had
come
to
regard
it
as
part
of
that
pervading
and
overwhelming
fatigue
that
she
should
bring
nothing
but
a
faint
distaste
to
her
compulsory
religious
exercises
towards
the
close
of
vespers
she
saw
a
come
on
tiptoe
into
the
chapel
and
kneeling
down
beside
mother
gertrude
daïs
begin
a
whispered
communication
immediately
a
feverish
agony
of
impatience
invaded
her
no
doubt
some
imperative
summons
to
an
interview
with
the
parents
of
a
nun
or
a
child
or
consultation
in
the
infirmary
where
two
or
three
little
girls
lay
with
some
lingering
childish
ailment
had
come
to
rob
the
superior
of
her
anticipated
free
time
alex
in
nervous
despair
saw
her
bend
her
head
in
acquiescence
the
retired
as
noiselessly
as
she
had
come
and
mother
gertrude
closed
her
book
the
concluding
versicles
and
prayers
were
spoken
kneeling
and
alex
was
compelled
to
turn
towards
the
high
altar
she
was
quivering
from
head
to
foot
and
gripped
the
arms
of
her
stall
in
order
to
restrain
herself
from
turning
her
head
every
nerve
was
strained
in
her
attempt
to
hear
any
movement
at
the
back
of
the
chapel
but
she
could
distinguish
nothing
the
few
minutes
that
elapsed
before
the
bell
sounded
for
rising
seemed
to
her
interminable
she
had
grown
accustomed
lately
to
the
grip
of
these
nervous
agonies
to
which
she
became
a
prey
for
the
most
trivial
of
causes
the
modern
exploitation
of
hysteria
however
was
still
in
its
embryo
stage
between
the
genteel
hysterics
of
the
and
the
suppressed
neuroticism
of
the
new
century
she
did
not
diagnose
her
complaint
with
the
sensation
familiar
to
her
of
blood
pumping
from
her
heart
to
her
head
making
her
face
burn
while
her
hands
and
feet
remained
dead
and
cold
she
rose
from
her
knees
although
she
had
expected
nothing
else
a
feeling
of
sick
disappointment
invaded
her
as
she
saw
that
the
superior
place
had
been
noiselessly
vacated
with
leaden
feet
she
moved
out
of
the
chapel
and
slowly
resumed
the
black
apron
and
the
stuff
sleeves
that
protected
her
habit
in
the
absence
of
any
direct
order
to
the
contrary
she
knew
that
she
must
take
her
accustomed
place
in
the
of
the
and
that
the
english
lesson
must
proceed
as
usual
a
vos
places
she
had
long
ago
learnt
to
speak
french
fluently
but
never
without
an
unmistakable
british
accent
and
intonation
subconsciously
she
was
always
rather
relieved
on
that
account
when
the
preliminaries
were
done
with
and
the
lesson
could
be
given
according
to
the
rules
in
the
english
tongue
simone
begin
please
sister
alexandra
seated
at
the
desk
held
the
book
open
in
front
of
her
and
her
eyes
rested
upon
the
page
but
her
mind
took
in
neither
the
meaning
of
the
printed
words
nor
the
sense
conveyed
by
simone
droning
inexpressive
voice
she
wondered
whether
some
one
would
come
to
take
her
place
at
the
desk
and
tell
her
that
mother
gertrude
was
waiting
for
her
downstairs
a
sudden
stealthy
opening
of
the
door
made
her
look
up
with
a
flash
of
hope
but
it
was
only
a
little
girl
late
for
her
lesson
and
sidling
in
hoping
to
escape
notice
alex
did
not
even
trouble
to
give
her
the
accustomed
bad
mark
it
would
have
meant
opening
her
desk
and
pulling
out
the
and
looking
for
a
pencil
and
she
felt
too
tired
in
her
earlier
days
at
the
convent
she
would
have
felt
ashamed
at
the
thought
of
yielding
to
such
slothful
unconcern
and
would
have
magnified
the
omission
into
a
sin
to
be
confessed
with
shame
to
mother
gertrude
now
she
was
too
tired
to
care
and
besides
she
never
saw
mother
gertrude
even
the
poor
little
that
had
been
held
out
to
her
was
not
to
be
hers
after
all
she
brooded
in
resentment
over
the
thought
a
titter
going
round
the
room
roused
her
what
are
you
saying
simone
simone
stared
back
at
her
stupidly
but
another
girl
in
the
front
row
of
desks
spoke
eagerly
she
said
nearly
all
through
the
lesson
there
nothing
left
for
any
one
else
to
say
you
can
repeat
it
afterwards
said
alex
coldly
she
was
vexed
that
her
inattention
should
have
been
betrayed
to
the
class
and
presently
she
gave
her
full
attention
to
the
recital
just
as
it
was
over
the
young
novice
sister
agnes
came
into
the
room
and
approaching
the
desk
spoke
to
alex
in
a
lowered
voice
mother
gertrude
sent
me
sister
will
you
go
down
to
her
and
wait
in
her
room
she
will
come
in
a
moment
i
am
to
take
the
children
back
to
the
for
you
thank
you
said
alex
trembling
the
revulsion
of
feeling
was
so
strong
that
she
felt
the
chords
tightening
in
her
throat
which
denoted
approaching
tears
such
as
she
often
shed
for
no
adequate
reason
she
left
the
room
the
assistant
superior
room
on
the
ground
floor
was
vacant
alex
sat
down
on
the
low
chair
drawn
close
to
the
superior
table
and
closed
her
eyes
now
that
her
agony
of
suspense
was
ended
she
became
even
more
overwhelmingly
conscious
of
fatigue
and
began
to
wonder
almost
against
her
will
whether
mother
gertrude
would
not
notice
it
and
perhaps
tell
her
that
she
was
to
go
to
bed
after
supper
and
not
come
to
the
recital
of
office
in
the
chapel
she
wondered
whether
she
looked
tired
there
were
no
in
the
convent
but
sometimes
she
had
seen
her
own
reflection
in
the
big
mirror
of
the
sacristy
and
she
knew
that
she
had
lost
her
colour
and
that
her
face
had
grown
thin
with
heavy
black
circles
underneath
her
eyes
she
knew
too
that
her
step
had
lost
any
elasticity
and
that
she
stooped
far
more
than
in
the
days
when
lady
isabel
had
implored
her
to
hold
up
so
that
her
pretty
frocks
might
be
seen
to
advantage
waiting
in
the
small
room
with
its
window
and
the
big
stacked
with
papers
and
a
great
crucifix
standing
upright
in
the
midst
of
them
she
began
for
the
first
time
to
speculate
as
to
the
reason
of
her
summons
it
occurred
to
her
with
a
slight
sense
of
shock
that
such
a
summons
in
the
case
of
nun
or
novice
had
very
often
been
the
prelude
to
an
announcement
of
bad
news
such
as
the
death
of
a
relative
at
home
hastily
she
pulled
out
barbara
letter
and
glanced
through
it
there
was
no
hint
of
approaching
disaster
in
the
rather
set
little
phrases
and
the
four
small
sheets
were
mostly
concerned
with
the
fact
that
barbara
was
finding
it
necessary
to
move
into
a
still
smaller
house
than
the
one
that
she
and
ralph
had
taken
at
hampstead
after
their
improvident
marriage
pamela
was
at
clevedon
square
with
cedric
and
his
wife
she
was
going
to
heaps
of
parties
and
every
one
thought
her
very
pretty
and
amusing
there
was
no
mention
of
archie
and
alex
hastily
ransacked
her
memory
as
to
his
whereabouts
since
the
first
year
of
her
novitiate
in
london
she
had
never
seen
her
youngest
brother
and
although
she
felt
a
fleeting
sorrow
at
the
thought
of
harm
having
befallen
him
her
tenderness
was
for
the
little
boy
in
a
sailor
suit
with
whom
she
had
played
and
quarrelled
in
the
clevedon
square
nursery
and
not
for
the
unknown
youth
of
later
years
as
she
speculated
the
tread
of
the
assistant
superior
sounded
down
the
corridors
a
hasty
decisive
footstep
alex
sprang
to
her
feet
as
the
door
opened
oh
what
is
it
she
cried
at
the
first
sight
of
the
superior
face
the
strong
lined
countenance
suffused
with
agitation
bore
every
mark
of
violent
disturbance
her
deep
voice
however
was
as
well
under
control
as
ever
although
strong
emotion
underlay
its
vibrant
quality
my
little
sister
you
have
a
big
sacrifice
before
you
i
can
not
pretend
to
think
that
it
will
not
cost
you
dear
as
it
will
me
but
we
know
who
asks
it
of
us
what
gasped
alex
again
utterly
at
a
loss
but
feeling
the
blood
ebb
from
her
face
our
has
appointed
me
as
superior
to
the
new
house
in
south
america
the
boat
sails
at
the
end
of
this
week
xx
aftermath
alex
could
not
believe
the
extent
of
the
calamity
that
had
befallen
her
nor
did
she
realize
at
first
that
the
very
mainspring
of
her
life
in
the
convent
was
attacked
it
astounded
her
to
perceive
that
to
the
rest
of
the
community
the
news
brought
no
overwhelming
shock
such
sudden
uprootings
and
transfers
were
not
uncommon
and
the
notice
given
was
generally
a
hour
one
mother
gertrude
had
nearly
a
week
in
which
to
make
her
few
preparations
for
an
exile
that
almost
certainly
was
for
life
and
to
prepare
herself
as
far
as
possible
for
new
and
heavy
responsibilities
the
was
herself
proceeding
to
south
america
with
the
little
band
of
chosen
pioneers
representative
of
almost
every
european
house
of
the
order
and
after
inaugurating
the
establishment
of
the
new
venture
was
to
return
to
liège
with
one
only
as
companion
in
the
general
concern
for
her
welfare
and
admiration
of
her
courage
in
undertaking
such
a
journey
on
the
eve
of
her
birthday
it
seemed
to
alex
that
all
other
considerations
were
overlooked
or
ignored
entirely
she
was
aware
that
the
convent
spirit
of
detachment
so
much
advocated
and
the
consciousness
of
that
vow
of
obedience
made
freely
and
fully
would
alike
preclude
the
possibility
of
any
spoken
protest
or
lamentation
over
the
separation
the
severing
of
human
ties
was
part
and
parcel
of
a
nun
sacrifice
and
her
life
was
in
the
hands
of
her
spiritual
superiors
there
was
no
discussion
possible
mother
gertrude
although
the
look
of
strain
was
deepening
round
her
eyes
and
mouth
went
steadily
about
her
duties
and
spared
herself
in
nothing
her
place
was
to
be
taken
temporarily
by
a
french
nun
who
had
been
for
many
years
at
liège
and
the
charge
was
handed
over
with
the
least
possible
dislocation
it
was
on
a
tuesday
night
that
mother
gertrude
had
been
told
of
the
destiny
in
store
for
her
and
on
the
following
saturday
she
was
to
proceed
with
her
superior
to
paris
and
thence
to
marseilles
to
the
boat
wednesday
and
thursday
alex
never
saw
her
she
had
expected
it
and
was
moreover
far
too
much
stunned
to
realize
anything
beyond
the
immediate
necessity
for
taking
her
habitual
place
in
the
community
life
without
betraying
the
sense
of
utter
despair
that
was
hovering
over
her
on
friday
afternoon
mother
gertrude
said
to
her
i
have
not
had
one
spare
moment
to
give
you
my
poor
child
but
i
think
you
know
everything
that
i
would
say
to
you
be
very
very
faithful
sister
and
remember
that
these
separations
may
be
for
life
but
all
eternity
is
before
us
alex
could
capture
nothing
of
the
rapt
assurance
that
lay
in
the
upraised
eyes
and
vibrant
voice
what
shall
i
do
without
you
she
asked
despairingly
feeling
how
inadequate
the
words
were
to
voice
her
sense
of
utter
deprivation
the
light
watchful
eyes
of
the
superior
seemed
to
pierce
through
her
do
say
that
dear
child
you
do
not
depend
in
any
sense
upon
another
creature
i
have
been
nothing
to
you
but
a
means
to
an
end
it
was
given
to
me
to
help
you
a
little
years
ago
to
find
your
holy
vocation
you
know
that
human
friendships
in
themselves
mean
nothing
something
in
alex
seemed
to
be
crying
and
protesting
aloud
in
repudiation
of
the
formula
to
which
her
lips
had
so
often
subscribed
but
her
own
tacit
acquiescence
of
years
rose
to
rebuke
her
and
the
dread
of
vexing
and
alienating
the
supervisor
at
this
eleventh
hour
dumbly
she
knelt
down
on
the
floor
beside
the
superior
chair
mother
gertrude
looked
at
her
compassionately
enough
but
with
the
strange
remoteness
induced
by
the
long
cultivation
of
an
absolutely
impersonal
relation
towards
humanity
my
poor
little
sister
sometimes
lately
i
have
wondered
whether
i
have
been
altogether
wise
in
my
treatment
of
you
and
whether
i
have
not
allowed
you
to
give
way
to
natural
affection
too
much
perhaps
this
break
has
come
in
time
you
must
remember
that
you
have
renounced
earthly
ties
even
the
holiest
and
most
sacred
ones
and
therefore
you
must
be
ready
to
make
any
sacrifice
for
the
sake
of
your
one
supreme
love
there
is
so
much
i
should
like
to
say
to
you
but
time
is
getting
short
now
and
there
is
a
great
deal
to
be
done
god
bless
you
my
child
the
superior
laid
her
hand
on
sister
alexandra
bent
head
alex
clasped
it
desperately
i
shall
still
be
your
child
always
she
almost
wailed
with
a
weight
of
things
unspoken
on
her
heart
and
in
a
last
frantic
attempt
to
carry
away
one
definite
assurance
the
slightest
possible
severity
mingled
in
mother
gertrude
clear
gaze
bent
downwards
as
she
rose
to
her
full
height
her
carriage
as
upright
and
as
dignified
as
it
had
been
ten
years
before
no
sister
she
said
very
distinctly
you
will
be
the
child
of
whatever
superior
god
may
send
you
in
my
place
you
know
that
we
in
the
convent
have
no
human
ties
only
spiritual
ones
you
will
see
your
divine
master
and
him
only
in
the
person
of
your
superior
in
religion
remember
that
little
sister
you
must
learn
detachment
if
you
are
to
be
truly
faithful
that
is
my
last
and
most
earnest
counsel
to
you
i
shall
pray
daily
that
you
may
be
given
strength
to
follow
it
do
go
gasped
alex
hardly
knowing
what
she
said
as
she
saw
the
superior
hand
upon
the
door
do
go
away
like
that
oh
mother
mother
how
shall
i
bear
it
i
only
got
you
and
now
you
going
away
for
ever
she
broke
into
tearless
sobs
sister
alexandra
has
it
come
to
this
i
am
indeed
to
blame
if
you
are
still
so
undisciplined
and
so
weak
as
to
cling
to
a
mere
creature
you
that
have
been
chosen
by
god
to
love
him
and
him
only
i
could
not
have
believed
it
mother
gertrude
tone
held
bitter
remorse
and
shame
alex
old
pitiful
instinct
of
propitiating
the
being
she
loved
best
sprang
to
life
within
her
no
no
i
did
really
mean
it
i
know
i
must
the
nun
gazed
at
her
in
compassionate
perplexity
you
are
overstrung
and
tired
you
do
know
what
you
are
saying
when
you
come
to
yourself
my
poor
child
you
will
hardly
believe
that
you
could
have
proved
so
disloyal
even
for
a
moment
now
calm
yourself
and
do
not
attempt
to
join
the
recreation
tonight
you
are
not
fit
for
it
i
will
tell
our
that
i
have
told
you
to
go
to
your
cell
as
soon
as
supper
is
over
and
again
sheer
terror
at
the
bare
thought
of
being
left
there
alone
forced
alex
to
her
feet
although
she
could
scarcely
stand
and
was
trembling
violently
you
wo
forget
me
she
entreated
almost
inaudibly
i
shall
always
remember
you
in
my
prayers
as
i
do
all
those
who
have
been
under
my
direction
indeed
you
will
have
a
special
place
in
them
said
the
superior
gravely
since
i
can
never
forget
that
by
the
grace
of
god
i
was
instrumental
in
bringing
you
into
his
holy
house
but
never
forget
that
human
relation
however
precious
it
may
be
can
have
any
completeness
in
itself
it
all
has
to
lead
on
to
the
one
supreme
thing
sister
the
thing
necessary
now
you
must
detain
me
no
longer
she
freed
herself
from
the
convulsive
grasp
that
alex
had
unconsciously
fastened
on
to
the
folds
of
her
habit
and
moved
unhesitatingly
to
the
door
alex
followed
her
with
eyes
that
stared
blankly
from
a
blanched
face
she
felt
as
though
she
was
under
a
spell
and
could
neither
move
nor
speak
she
could
not
believe
that
mother
gertrude
would
really
leave
her
in
that
way
the
superior
opened
the
door
and
passed
out
closing
it
behind
her
without
pausing
or
looking
back
alex
heard
her
steps
receding
rapid
and
measured
along
the
uncarpeted
corridor
outside
she
stayed
on
and
on
in
the
little
cold
room
the
winter
dusk
deepening
rapidly
outside
the
silence
only
broken
by
the
occasional
clanging
of
a
bell
to
the
sound
of
which
she
was
so
much
inured
that
it
hardly
struck
upon
her
senses
she
thought
that
mother
gertrude
would
come
back
to
her
there
must
be
some
other
last
words
between
them
than
those
few
impersonal
counsels
of
perfection
that
repudiated
any
more
intimate
link
such
as
alex
exclusive
jealousy
stifled
but
never
stronger
than
after
those
ten
years
of
repression
now
claimed
with
such
frantic
yearning
she
waited
scarcely
moving
she
grew
colder
and
colder
but
she
was
unconscious
of
her
icy
feet
and
leaden
hands
she
was
not
even
aware
of
consecutive
thought
her
whole
body
was
absorbed
in
the
supreme
act
of
awaiting
the
superior
return
for
the
word
the
look
that
should
at
least
break
the
dreadful
darkness
that
encompassed
her
soul
at
the
sudden
deprivation
of
that
one
outlet
which
had
unaware
served
as
a
for
the
whole
craving
dependence
of
her
spirit
mother
gertrude
did
not
come
back
dusk
turned
rapidly
to
night
and
the
distant
cries
and
laughter
of
the
children
evening
recreation
fell
into
a
quiet
that
was
only
shattered
by
the
single
note
of
the
bell
that
proclaimed
the
hour
of
silence
and
the
final
gathering
of
the
community
for
the
last
recital
of
the
office
in
the
chapel
there
was
the
flicker
of
a
light
along
the
passage
outside
and
the
door
opened
at
last
alex
did
not
move
she
turned
anguished
eyes
that
held
scarcely
any
comprehension
in
the
immensity
of
their
fatigue
towards
the
entering
figure
it
was
that
of
the
old
infirmarian
who
put
down
the
lighted
candle
and
threw
up
her
hands
of
dismay
as
her
gaze
met
that
of
the
younger
nun
mindful
of
the
hour
of
silence
she
asked
no
question
but
she
took
alex
away
to
the
convent
infirmary
and
placed
her
in
a
bed
of
which
the
mattress
seemed
strangely
and
wonderfully
soft
after
the
in
her
cell
and
gave
her
a
hot
sweet
strongly
scented
and
bade
her
sleep
mais
demain
whispered
alex
she
was
thinking
of
the
early
departure
in
the
raw
morning
cold
when
the
convoy
that
was
leaving
for
south
america
would
be
driven
away
from
the
convent
but
the
infirmarian
shook
her
head
and
shuffled
slowly
away
leaving
the
room
in
darkness
she
was
old
and
very
tired
and
for
her
there
was
no
except
the
glorious
dawn
that
should
herald
the
day
of
eternity
alex
lay
awake
in
the
merciful
darkness
and
envisaged
the
culmination
of
long
years
of
stifled
repression
and
she
knew
now
as
she
had
never
let
herself
know
before
what
had
sustained
her
through
the
dragging
years
after
the
final
objective
of
her
vows
had
been
left
behind
she
knew
that
she
had
thought
herself
to
be
answering
to
a
call
of
god
when
she
had
been
hearing
only
the
voice
of
mother
gertrude
and
had
been
craving
only
for
mother
gertrude
tenderness
and
approbation
physical
pangs
of
terror
shot
through
her
and
shook
her
from
head
to
foot
as
she
realized
to
what
she
had
bound
herself
which
now
presented
itself
to
her
overstrung
perceptions
only
in
the
crudest
terms
to
live
without
earthly
affection
to
relinquish
love
as
she
understood
it
in
terms
of
human
sympathy
for
an
ideal
to
which
she
knew
with
tardy
and
unerring
certainty
that
nothing
within
her
would
ever
conform
she
knew
now
with
that
appalling
to
which
humanity
is
mercifully
a
stranger
until
or
unless
the
last
outposts
of
sanity
are
almost
reached
that
the
vocation
of
which
they
all
spoke
so
glibly
had
never
been
hers
she
had
entered
a
life
for
which
her
every
instinct
declared
her
to
be
utterly
unfitted
in
search
of
that
which
her
few
short
years
in
the
outside
world
had
denied
her
the
convent
instinct
engrained
in
her
at
last
added
to
the
anguish
of
startled
horror
at
the
wickedness
of
her
own
state
of
mind
is
not
she
thought
alex
had
tried
to
cheat
god
and
for
ten
years
he
had
stayed
his
hand
and
had
allowed
her
deception
to
go
on
and
now
it
had
all
fallen
on
her
shame
and
punishment
and
despair
and
nowhere
any
human
help
or
consolation
to
turn
to
she
prayed
frenziedly
in
the
darkness
but
no
comfort
came
to
her
she
stifled
in
the
pillow
the
imploring
crying
aloud
of
mother
gertrude
name
that
sprang
to
her
lips
but
with
a
pang
that
sickened
her
she
recalled
the
parting
from
her
that
evening
her
undeviating
fidelity
to
an
austere
ideal
which
should
also
have
been
alex
there
was
nothing
anywhere
and
with
that
final
certainty
of
negation
came
a
rigidity
of
despair
that
no
terms
of
time
or
space
could
measure
alex
fell
into
exhaustion
then
into
a
state
of
coma
that
became
heavy
dreamless
sleep
enduring
far
into
the
next
day
she
woke
to
instant
stabbing
recollection
it
was
a
grey
leaden
day
with
rain
lashing
the
and
at
first
alex
thought
that
it
might
be
still
early
morning
but
there
was
all
the
indescribable
stir
that
tells
of
a
household
when
the
day
work
is
in
full
swing
and
presently
she
realized
that
it
must
be
the
middle
of
the
morning
they
have
gone
she
thought
but
the
words
conveyed
no
meaning
to
her
the
infirmarian
came
in
to
her
and
spoke
and
asked
whether
she
felt
fit
to
get
up
and
although
on
the
day
before
alex
had
so
craved
for
rest
she
heard
her
own
voice
replying
indifferently
that
she
thought
she
was
quite
well
and
that
she
was
ready
to
rise
at
once
you
are
sure
you
have
taken
no
chill
you
must
have
been
there
in
mother
gertrude
room
for
a
long
time
after
you
were
taken
faint
can
you
remember
the
nun
looked
at
her
puzzled
and
anxious
did
i
faint
i
think
so
surely
you
were
almost
unconscious
when
i
came
in
quite
by
chance
and
found
you
there
almost
frozen
poor
little
sister
now
tell
me
the
old
infirmarian
put
a
few
stereotyped
questions
such
as
she
addressed
to
all
those
of
her
patients
whose
ailments
could
not
be
immediately
diagnosed
at
sight
alex
replies
for
the
most
part
denials
of
the
suggested
ills
left
her
no
wiser
finally
she
decided
on
a
put
a
piece
of
flannel
over
your
chest
she
said
gravely
and
you
had
perhaps
better
spend
recreation
indoors
until
the
spell
of
cold
is
over
thank
you
said
sister
alexandra
lifelessly
what
time
is
it
nearly
eleven
have
you
any
duties
for
which
you
should
be
replaced
this
morning
there
are
a
lot
of
things
i
think
said
alex
vaguely
but
i
can
get
up
very
well
the
infirmarian
acquiesced
unemotionally
there
is
much
work
to
be
done
as
you
say
and
we
nuns
can
not
afford
to
be
ill
for
long
alex
did
not
think
that
she
was
ill
she
was
quite
able
to
get
up
and
to
dress
herself
although
her
head
was
aching
and
her
hands
shook
oddly
she
reflected
with
dull
surprise
that
all
the
poignant
misery
of
the
days
that
had
gone
before
seemed
to
have
left
her
evidently
this
was
what
people
meant
by
getting
over
things
one
suffered
until
one
could
bear
no
more
and
then
it
was
all
numbness
and
inertia
she
felt
a
sort
of
surprised
gratitude
to
god
at
the
cessation
of
pain
as
one
who
had
undergone
torture
might
feel
towards
the
torturers
for
some
brief
respite
her
thankfulness
made
tears
come
into
her
eyes
and
she
forced
them
back
with
a
sort
of
wonder
at
herself
but
that
odd
disposition
to
weep
still
remained
with
her
as
she
went
downstairs
rather
slowly
and
cautiously
because
her
knees
were
shaking
so
strangely
she
met
a
very
little
girl
the
pet
and
baby
of
the
whole
establishment
climbing
upwards
she
was
holding
up
the
corners
of
her
diminutive
black
apron
with
both
hands
and
after
looking
at
the
nun
silently
for
a
moment
she
showed
her
that
it
contained
two
tiny
struggling
kittens
les
petits
enfants
de
minet
she
announced
gravely
and
went
on
climbing
clasping
her
burden
tenderly
alex
could
never
have
told
what
it
was
that
struck
her
with
so
unbearable
a
sense
of
pathos
in
the
sight
of
the
little
childish
figure
quite
suddenly
the
tears
began
to
pour
down
her
face
and
she
could
neither
have
checked
them
nor
have
assigned
any
reason
for
them
she
went
on
downstairs
wiping
the
blinding
tears
from
her
sight
and
amazed
at
the
violence
of
the
uncontrollable
sobs
that
were
noiselessly
shaking
her
something
had
suddenly
given
way
within
her
and
passed
far
beyond
her
own
control
it
was
as
though
she
could
never
stop
crying
again
xxi
father
farrell
for
what
seemed
a
long
while
afterwards
a
period
which
indeed
covered
three
or
four
weeks
alex
learnt
to
be
intensely
and
humbly
grateful
for
the
convent
law
that
would
not
allow
any
form
of
personalities
in
intercourse
she
was
utterly
unable
to
cease
from
crying
and
in
spite
of
her
shame
and
almost
her
terror
the
tears
continued
to
stream
down
her
face
in
the
chapel
in
the
refectory
even
at
the
hour
of
recreation
nobody
asked
her
any
questions
one
or
two
of
the
nuns
looked
at
her
compassionately
or
made
some
kindly
little
friendly
remark
a
now
and
then
offered
her
an
unexpected
piece
of
help
in
her
work
and
the
infirmarian
occasionally
sent
her
a
cup
of
for
dinner
but
it
was
nobody
business
to
offer
inquiries
and
had
any
one
done
so
the
rule
would
have
compelled
sister
alexandra
to
reply
by
a
generality
and
to
change
the
conversation
without
delay
only
the
superior
was
entitled
to
probe
deeper
and
at
first
the
frenchwoman
who
was
temporarily
succeeding
mother
gertrude
was
too
much
occupied
by
her
new
cares
to
see
much
of
her
community
individually
alex
was
relieved
when
the
christmas
holidays
began
and
she
had
no
longer
to
fear
the
notice
of
the
children
but
in
the
reduction
of
work
surrounding
the
festive
season
it
became
impossible
that
her
breakdown
should
continue
to
pass
unnoticed
she
did
not
herself
know
what
was
the
matter
and
could
scarcely
have
given
a
cause
for
those
incessant
tears
except
that
she
was
unutterably
weary
and
miserable
and
that
they
had
passed
far
beyond
her
own
control
the
idea
that
that
continuous
weeping
could
have
any
connection
with
a
physical
nervous
breakdown
never
occurred
to
her
it
was
with
surprise
and
very
little
thought
of
cause
and
effect
that
she
one
night
noticed
her
own
extraordinary
loss
of
flesh
she
had
never
been
anything
but
thin
and
slightly
built
but
now
she
quite
suddenly
perceived
that
her
arms
and
legs
in
the
last
two
months
had
taken
on
an
astounding
and
literal
resemblance
to
long
sticks
of
white
wood
all
the
way
up
from
wrist
to
armpit
her
left
hand
with
thumb
and
middle
finger
joined
could
span
the
circumference
of
her
right
arm
it
seemed
incredible
her
mind
went
back
ten
years
and
she
thought
of
lady
isabel
and
how
much
she
had
lamented
her
daughter
youthful
angularity
if
she
could
have
seen
this
thought
alex
but
of
course
it
only
mattered
for
evening
dress
she
would
have
thought
it
mattered
for
a
nun
instantly
she
began
to
cry
again
although
her
head
throbbed
and
her
eyes
burned
and
smarted
there
was
no
need
now
to
wonder
if
she
looked
tired
accidentally
one
day
her
hand
to
her
face
she
had
felt
the
sort
of
pit
that
now
lay
underneath
each
eye
worn
into
a
groove
she
had
ceased
to
wonder
whether
life
would
ever
offer
anything
but
this
mechanical
round
of
blurred
pain
and
misery
these
incessant
tears
when
the
superior
sent
for
her
what
is
the
matter
with
you
sister
they
tell
me
you
are
always
in
tears
are
you
ill
alex
shook
her
head
dumbly
sister
control
yourself
you
will
be
ill
if
you
cry
like
that
kneel
sit
down
the
superior
tone
was
very
kind
and
the
note
of
sympathy
shook
alex
afresh
tell
me
what
it
is
do
be
afraid
i
want
to
leave
the
convent
i
want
to
be
released
from
my
vows
she
had
never
meant
to
say
it
she
had
never
known
that
such
a
thought
was
in
her
mind
but
the
moment
that
the
words
were
uttered
the
first
sense
of
relief
that
she
had
felt
surged
within
her
it
was
the
remembrance
of
that
rush
of
relief
that
enabled
her
sobbing
to
repeat
the
shameful
recantation
in
the
face
of
the
superior
grave
pitiful
urgings
and
assurance
that
she
did
not
know
what
she
was
saying
after
that
an
appalling
crisis
that
left
her
utterly
exhausted
and
with
no
vestige
of
belief
left
in
her
own
ultimate
salvation
everything
was
changed
she
was
treated
as
an
invalid
and
sent
to
lie
down
instead
of
joining
the
community
at
the
hour
of
recreation
the
superior
herself
devoted
almost
an
hour
to
her
every
day
and
nearly
all
her
work
was
taken
away
so
that
she
could
walk
alone
round
the
big
and
the
enclosed
garden
and
read
the
lives
and
treatises
that
the
superior
chose
for
her
gradually
some
sort
of
poise
returned
to
her
she
could
control
her
tears
and
drink
the
soups
and
that
were
specially
prepared
and
put
before
her
and
as
the
year
advanced
she
could
feel
the
first
hint
of
spring
stirring
in
her
exhaustion
she
was
devoid
alike
of
apprehension
and
of
hope
no
solution
appeared
to
her
conceivable
save
possibly
that
of
her
own
death
and
she
knew
that
none
would
be
attempted
until
the
return
of
the
from
south
america
as
this
delayed
she
became
more
and
more
convinced
in
despite
of
all
reason
of
the
immutable
eternity
of
the
present
state
of
affairs
it
shocked
her
when
one
day
the
superior
said
to
her
you
are
to
go
to
the
superior
of
the
jesuits
college
in
the
parlour
this
afternoon
do
you
remember
he
preached
the
sermon
for
your
profession
and
i
think
he
has
been
here
once
or
twice
in
the
last
year
or
two
he
is
a
very
wise
and
clever
and
holy
man
and
ought
to
help
you
besides
he
is
of
your
own
nationality
alex
remembered
the
tall
irishman
very
well
he
had
once
or
twice
visited
the
convent
and
had
always
told
amusing
stories
at
recreation
and
preached
vigorous
inspiring
sermons
in
the
chapel
with
more
than
a
spice
of
originality
to
colour
them
the
children
adored
him
alex
wondered
perhaps
father
farrell
the
clever
and
educated
priest
would
really
see
in
some
new
aspect
the
problem
that
left
her
baffled
and
sick
of
soul
and
body
she
went
into
the
parlour
that
afternoon
trembling
with
mingled
dread
and
the
first
faint
stirrings
of
hope
that
understanding
and
release
from
herself
and
her
wickedness
might
yet
be
in
store
for
her
father
farrell
big
and
with
wavy
hair
and
a
strong
handsome
face
turned
from
the
window
as
she
entered
the
room
come
in
sister
come
in
sit
down
wo
you
they
tell
me
ye
not
been
well
ye
do
look
it
ye
do
look
it
his
voice
too
was
big
and
bluff
and
hearty
full
of
decision
the
voice
of
a
man
accustomed
to
the
command
of
men
he
pushed
a
chair
forward
and
motioned
her
with
a
quick
imperious
gesture
that
yet
held
kindness
to
sit
down
he
himself
stood
towering
over
her
by
the
window
well
now
what
all
the
trouble
sister
there
was
the
suspicion
of
a
brogue
in
his
cultivated
tones
alex
made
a
tremendous
effort
she
told
herself
that
he
could
not
help
her
unless
she
told
him
the
truth
she
said
as
she
had
said
to
the
french
superior
i
am
very
unhappy
i
want
to
be
released
from
my
vows
as
a
nun
the
priest
gave
her
one
very
quick
penetrating
look
and
his
thick
eyebrows
went
up
into
his
hair
for
an
instant
but
he
did
not
speak
i
do
think
i
have
ever
had
any
any
real
vocation
said
alex
whitening
from
the
effort
of
an
admission
that
she
knew
he
must
regard
as
degrading
and
how
long
have
ye
thought
ye
had
no
real
vocation
there
was
the
slightest
possible
discernible
tinge
of
kindly
derision
in
the
inquiry
it
gave
the
final
touch
to
her
disconcertment
i
do
know
she
felt
the
folly
of
her
reply
even
before
the
priest
laugh
tinged
with
a
sort
of
vexed
contempt
rang
through
the
room
now
me
dear
child
this
is
perfect
nonsense
let
me
tell
ye
did
ye
ever
hear
the
like
of
such
folly
no
real
vocation
and
here
ye
been
a
professed
religious
for
how
long
is
it
nearly
four
years
since
i
was
finally
professed
but
there
no
about
it
sister
a
vow
made
to
our
blessed
lord
have
ye
know
is
not
like
an
old
glove
to
be
thrown
away
when
ye
think
ye
tired
of
it
no
no
sister
that
not
be
the
way
of
it
get
over
this
me
dear
child
with
a
little
faith
and
perseverance
just
a
temptation
that
ye
perhaps
been
giving
way
to
owing
to
fatigue
and
ill
health
ye
feel
it
all
too
hard
for
ye
is
that
it
no
said
alex
frantically
that
not
it
it
nothing
like
that
it
that
i
ca
bear
this
way
of
living
any
longer
i
want
a
home
and
to
be
allowed
to
care
for
people
and
to
have
friends
again
i
live
by
myself
she
knew
that
she
had
voiced
the
truth
as
she
knew
it
and
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
in
dread
lest
it
might
fail
to
reach
his
perceptions
she
heard
a
change
in
father
farrell
voice
when
next
he
spoke
ye
better
tell
me
the
whole
tale
sister
who
is
it
ye
want
to
go
back
to
in
the
world
she
looked
up
bewildered
any
one
home
where
i
can
just
be
myself
again
and
how
much
home
have
ye
got
left
after
being
a
nun
ten
years
is
your
mother
alive
no
your
father
no
faltered
alex
they
died
after
ye
left
home
i
daresay
yes
then
in
the
name
of
goodness
who
do
ye
expect
is
going
to
make
a
home
for
ye
have
ye
sisters
and
brothers
yes
alex
hesitated
seeing
at
last
whither
his
inquiries
were
tending
yes
and
i
thinking
they
married
and
with
homes
of
their
own
by
this
time
said
the
priest
shrewdly
let
me
tell
ye
ten
years
sees
a
good
many
changes
in
the
world
and
it
is
much
of
a
welcome
ye
get
by
breaking
your
holy
vows
and
making
a
great
scandal
in
the
church
and
then
planting
yourself
on
relations
who
lost
touch
with
ye
more
or
less
and
have
homes
of
their
own
and
a
husband
or
wife
as
the
case
may
be
and
perhaps
little
children
to
care
for
a
maiden
aunt
is
so
very
much
thought
of
in
the
best
of
circumstances
let
me
tell
ye
now
is
there
reason
in
what
i
saying
sister
sick
conviction
shot
through
her
yes
father
well
then
ye
just
give
up
that
foolish
notion
now
he
looked
at
her
white
desperate
face
and
began
to
take
long
strides
up
and
down
the
room
have
ye
confidence
in
your
superior
do
ye
get
on
with
her
he
asked
suddenly
our
present
superior
has
only
been
here
a
little
while
the
one
before
that
i
know
i
know
he
interrupted
impatiently
it
the
i
mean
of
course
everything
must
come
to
her
in
the
long
run
naturally
have
you
full
confidence
in
her
now
alex
felt
as
incapable
of
a
negative
reply
as
of
an
affirmative
one
she
knew
that
she
did
not
understand
the
term
full
confidence
as
he
did
and
she
temporized
weakly
but
our
is
away
in
south
america
she
keeps
delaying
and
that
one
reason
why
nothing
has
been
settled
about
me
she
even
left
america
yet
i
well
aware
of
that
do
waste
time
playing
with
me
that
way
sister
ye
get
no
further
ye
know
very
well
what
i
mean
now
tell
me
now
will
it
do
for
ye
if
i
arrange
for
your
transfer
to
another
house
maybe
to
the
one
in
london
or
somewhere
in
your
own
country
the
instinct
of
the
imprisoned
creature
that
sees
another
form
of
the
same
trap
offered
it
under
the
guise
of
freedom
made
her
revolt
no
she
cried
no
i
want
to
get
right
away
i
want
to
stop
being
a
nun
the
priest
suddenly
hit
the
table
with
his
clenched
fist
making
it
rock
and
making
his
auditor
start
painfully
that
what
you
never
do
not
if
ye
got
release
from
the
holy
vows
ten
times
over
once
a
nun
always
a
nun
sister
although
ye
may
be
false
and
faithless
and
go
back
into
the
very
midst
of
the
world
renounced
but
ye
find
no
comfort
there
no
blessing
and
remember
it
against
ye
sister
a
soul
that
spurns
his
choicest
graces
need
expect
no
mercy
either
here
or
hereafter
i
tell
ye
straight
sister
that
ye
be
deliberately
jeopardizing
your
immortal
soul
if
ye
give
in
to
this
wicked
folly
ye
to
choose
between
god
and
the
devil
between
a
little
while
of
suffering
here
maybe
and
then
eternity
in
which
to
enjoy
the
reward
of
the
faithful
or
a
hideous
mockery
of
freedom
here
followed
by
hell
and
its
torments
for
ever
and
ever
which
is
it
to
be
alex
was
terrified
but
it
was
the
priest
anger
that
terrified
her
not
the
threats
that
he
uttered
at
the
back
of
her
mind
lay
the
dim
conviction
that
no
hell
could
surpass
in
intensity
of
bitterness
that
which
her
spirit
was
traversing
on
earth
father
farrell
looked
at
her
frightened
distorted
face
and
his
voice
sank
into
persuasiveness
this
pass
me
dear
child
many
a
poor
soul
before
ye
has
known
what
it
is
to
falter
by
the
wayside
but
courage
sister
ye
can
conquer
this
weakness
with
god
help
you
in
no
trouble
about
your
faith
now
are
ye
had
alex
been
able
to
formulate
her
thoughts
clearly
she
might
have
told
him
that
it
had
long
since
become
a
matter
of
supreme
unimportance
to
her
whether
or
no
she
still
possessed
that
which
he
termed
her
faith
as
a
fact
the
beliefs
which
could
alone
have
made
the
convent
life
endurable
to
her
had
never
struck
more
than
the
most
shallow
of
roots
into
her
consciousness
perhaps
the
only
belief
which
had
any
real
hold
upon
her
was
the
one
that
she
had
gradually
formed
upon
her
experience
of
the
living
that
god
was
a
superior
being
who
must
be
propitiated
by
the
sacrifice
of
all
that
one
held
dear
lest
he
strike
it
from
one
she
looked
dimly
at
father
farrell
and
shook
her
head
because
she
was
afraid
of
his
anger
if
she
owned
to
the
utter
insecurity
of
her
hold
upon
any
religious
convictions
that
right
that
right
he
said
hastily
i
felt
sure
ye
were
a
good
child
at
bottom
now
would
ye
like
to
make
a
good
general
confession
and
i
give
ye
absolution
and
ye
can
start
again
some
hint
of
inflexibility
in
the
last
words
roused
alex
to
a
final
frantic
bid
for
liberty
it
no
use
it
wo
do
for
me
to
begin
again
i
ca
stay
on
if
i
ca
get
released
from
my
vows
i
i
run
away
then
there
was
a
long
silence
when
the
priest
spoke
again
however
his
voice
held
more
of
meditative
speculation
than
of
the
anger
which
she
feared
supposing
i
could
arrange
it
for
ye
i
do
say
i
could
mind
but
it
might
be
done
if
good
reasons
were
shown
what
would
ye
say
to
another
religious
order
altogether
it
may
be
that
this
life
is
unsuited
to
ye
there
have
been
such
cases
i
know
a
holy
carmelite
nun
who
was
in
quite
another
order
for
nearly
fifteen
years
before
she
found
out
where
the
lord
really
wanted
her
are
ye
one
of
those
maybe
no
spoke
alex
almost
sullenly
the
conflict
was
wearing
her
out
and
she
was
conscious
only
of
a
blind
unreasoning
instinct
that
if
she
once
gave
ground
she
would
find
herself
for
ever
bound
to
the
life
which
had
become
unendurable
to
her
what
d
mean
i
want
to
go
away
i
want
to
be
released
from
my
vows
the
formula
had
become
almost
mechanical
now
the
jesuit
for
the
first
time
dropped
the
brusqueness
of
manner
habitual
to
him
pacing
the
length
of
the
big
parlour
with
measured
even
strides
his
hands
clasped
behind
his
shabby
cassock
he
let
his
deep
naturally
rhetorical
voice
boom
out
in
full
rolling
periods
through
the
room
why
did
ye
come
to
me
at
all
sister
it
was
for
advice
and
it
was
for
help
i
offered
both
and
ye
take
neither
having
put
your
hand
to
the
plough
you
looked
back
ye
say
that
sooner
than
remain
faithful
ye
run
away
ye
make
a
scandal
and
a
disgrace
for
the
community
that
sheltered
ye
and
bring
shame
and
sorrow
to
the
good
mothers
here
what
did
ye
expect
me
to
answer
to
that
if
your
whole
will
is
turned
to
evil
it
was
a
farce
and
a
mockery
to
come
to
me
i
can
do
nothing
but
one
thing
i
tell
ye
sister
if
ye
do
this
thing
if
it
goes
up
to
rome
and
the
vows
ye
took
in
full
consciousness
and
free
will
on
the
day
ye
were
professed
are
dissolved
so
far
as
they
ever
can
be
that
is
and
let
me
tell
ye
that
it
neither
a
quick
nor
an
easy
business
if
it
comes
to
that
sister
be
no
going
no
cringing
round
to
the
convent
afterwards
when
ye
find
there
no
place
and
no
welcome
for
ye
in
the
world
asking
to
be
taken
back
they
not
have
ye
sister
and
they
be
right
if
ye
go
it
for
ever
it
seemed
to
alex
that
he
was
purposely
seeking
to
frighten
her
that
he
wanted
to
add
fresh
miseries
and
apprehensions
to
those
already
piled
upon
her
and
a
faint
resentment
flicked
at
her
in
questioning
acceptance
of
such
an
assumption
the
shadow
of
spirit
thus
restored
to
her
just
enabled
her
to
endure
the
seemingly
endless
exposition
hurled
at
her
in
the
priest
powerful
voice
when
it
was
all
over
she
crawled
out
of
the
room
like
a
creature
that
had
been
beaten
stunned
she
only
knew
that
yet
another
had
entered
the
league
of
those
who
were
angered
against
her
xxii
rome
the
crisis
passed
as
all
such
must
pass
and
alex
found
herself
in
the
position
openly
recognized
as
that
of
waiting
for
the
dissolution
of
her
religious
vows
it
was
as
father
farrell
had
said
neither
a
short
nor
an
easy
business
nor
was
she
allowed
to
pass
the
months
of
her
waiting
at
the
liège
they
sent
her
to
a
small
house
of
the
order
in
rome
thinking
with
the
curious
convent
instinct
for
misplaced
economy
to
save
the
petty
cost
of
incessant
passing
to
and
fro
of
correspondence
and
documents
between
the
convent
in
belgium
and
the
papal
secretariat
at
the
vatican
alex
went
to
italy
in
a
dream
it
struck
her
with
a
faint
sense
of
irony
that
she
and
barbara
long
ago
had
entertained
an
ambition
to
visit
italy
standing
for
all
that
was
romantic
and
picturesque
in
the
south
after
all
she
was
to
be
the
first
to
realize
that
girlish
dream
the
fulfilment
of
which
brought
no
elation
at
first
she
lived
amongst
the
nuns
and
led
their
life
but
when
it
became
evident
beyond
question
that
she
was
eventually
to
obtain
release
from
her
vows
the
community
held
no
place
for
her
any
longer
her
religious
habit
was
taken
away
and
a
thick
voluminous
dress
substituted
which
the
nuns
thought
light
and
cool
in
comparison
with
their
own
weighty
garments
but
of
which
the
hard
stiff
cuffs
and
high
collar
unrelieved
by
any
softening
of
white
made
alex
suffer
greatly
the
house
was
too
small
to
admit
of
a
but
the
nuns
took
in
an
inconsiderable
number
of
lady
boarders
and
an
occasional
pupil
alex
however
was
not
suffered
to
hold
any
intercourse
with
these
after
her
six
months
spent
in
community
life
a
final
appeal
was
made
to
her
and
when
it
failed
of
its
effect
she
passed
into
a
kind
of
moral
ostracism
she
had
a
small
bedroom
where
her
meals
were
served
by
the
who
waited
on
the
and
a
little
was
put
in
a
remote
corner
of
the
chapel
for
her
use
neither
to
be
confounded
with
the
nor
the
benches
for
visitors
nor
the
seats
reserved
for
the
ladies
living
in
the
house
the
librarian
sister
in
charge
of
the
of
the
had
instructions
to
provide
her
with
literature
beyond
that
her
existence
remained
unrecognized
she
often
spent
hours
doing
nothing
gazing
from
the
window
at
the
far
below
so
curiously
instinct
with
life
after
the
solitude
of
the
liège
grounds
encompassed
by
high
walls
on
every
side
she
did
not
read
very
much
the
books
they
gave
her
were
all
designed
to
one
end
that
of
making
her
realize
that
she
was
turning
her
back
upon
the
way
of
salvation
when
she
thought
about
it
alex
believed
that
this
was
in
truth
what
she
was
doing
but
it
hardly
seemed
to
matter
her
room
was
fireless
and
the
house
as
most
roman
ones
had
no
form
of
central
heating
she
shivered
and
shivered
and
in
the
early
days
of
february
fell
one
abscess
after
another
formed
inside
her
throat
an
unspeakably
painful
manifestation
of
general
weakness
one
evening
she
was
so
ill
that
there
was
talk
of
sending
for
the
chaplain
the
doctor
had
never
been
suggested
but
that
same
night
the
worst
abscess
of
all
broke
inside
her
throat
and
alex
saw
that
there
was
no
hope
of
her
being
about
to
die
the
bright
winter
cold
seemed
to
change
with
incredible
rapidity
into
glowing
summer
heat
and
a
modicum
of
gradually
returned
to
her
she
even
crept
slowly
and
listlessly
about
in
the
shade
of
the
great
borghese
gardens
in
the
comparative
freshness
of
the
pincio
height
and
wondered
piteously
at
this
strange
realization
of
her
girlhood
dream
of
seeing
italy
she
never
dared
to
go
into
the
streets
alone
nor
would
the
nuns
have
permitted
it
her
difficult
letters
to
england
had
been
written
cedric
had
replied
with
courteous
brevity
a
letter
so
much
what
sir
francis
might
have
written
that
alex
was
almost
startled
and
her
father
man
of
business
had
written
her
a
short
kind
little
note
rejoicing
that
the
world
was
again
to
have
the
benefit
of
miss
society
after
her
temporary
retirement
the
only
long
letter
she
received
was
from
barbara
dearest
alex
your
letter
from
rome
was
of
course
a
great
surprise
i
had
been
wondering
when
i
should
hear
from
you
again
but
i
did
not
at
all
guess
what
your
news
would
be
when
it
came
as
we
had
all
quite
grown
to
think
of
you
as
completely
settled
in
the
convent
i
am
afraid
that
as
you
say
there
may
be
complications
and
difficulties
about
your
vows
as
i
suppose
they
are
binding
to
a
certain
extent
and
they
are
sure
not
to
let
you
off
without
a
fuss
your
letters
are
very
explicit
my
dear
so
i
still
somewhat
in
the
dark
as
to
what
you
are
doing
and
when
you
mean
to
come
to
london
as
i
suppose
you
will
eventually
do
and
why
italy
if
you
going
to
get
out
of
the
whole
thing
altogether
it
seems
funny
that
the
convent
people
should
trouble
to
send
you
to
italy
when
you
might
just
as
well
have
come
straight
to
england
however
no
doubt
you
know
your
own
affairs
best
alex
dear
and
perhaps
you
wise
to
take
advantage
of
an
opportunity
that
may
not
come
again
travelling
has
always
been
my
dream
as
you
know
but
except
for
that
time
i
had
at
neuilly
when
you
came
out
heavens
what
ages
ago
and
then
our
honeymoon
in
paris
which
was
so
terribly
broken
into
when
dear
mother
died
i
never
had
any
chance
at
all
and
i
suppose
now
i
never
shall
have
everything
is
so
expensive
and
really
not
a
very
good
traveller
unless
i
can
afford
to
do
the
thing
otherwise
i
should
simply
love
to
have
run
over
to
rome
for
easter
and
got
you
to
show
me
all
the
sights
i
suppose
your
time
is
quite
your
own
now
of
course
when
you
really
do
leave
the
sisters
i
hope
you
come
straight
to
my
wee
cottage
here
at
any
rate
while
you
look
about
you
and
think
over
future
plans
cedric
has
written
to
you
i
know
and
if
you
feel
you
rather
go
to
clevedon
square
needless
to
say
my
dear
i
shall
more
than
understand
please
yourself
but
of
course
one
always
rather
chary
of
unknown
and
violet
quite
rules
the
roost
she
and
cedric
are
a
most
devoted
couple
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
but
as
she
got
all
the
money
one
rather
feels
as
if
it
was
house
i
daresay
you
know
the
kind
of
thing
i
mean
she
quite
a
dear
in
many
ways
but
i
do
go
there
tremendously
pamela
adores
her
and
lives
in
her
pocket
pam
tells
me
she
has
seen
you
since
she
was
about
fifteen
i
could
hardly
believe
it
my
dear
i
do
know
what
you
think
of
her
she
quite
appallingly
modern
to
my
mind
and
makes
me
feel
about
a
hundred
years
old
when
i
think
of
the
way
were
chaperoned
and
sent
about
everywhere
with
a
maid
and
only
allowed
the
dullest
of
and
and
then
those
stiff
solemn
balls
pamela
is
for
ever
being
asked
to
affairs
and
dinner
dances
and
i
must
say
she
a
huge
success
every
one
raves
about
her
and
she
goes
in
for
being
tremendously
natural
and
jolly
and
full
of
vitality
and
she
had
simply
heaps
of
chances
already
though
i
daresay
some
of
it
has
to
do
with
being
seen
about
everywhere
with
violet
who
simply
splashes
money
out
like
water
she
paid
all
archie
debts
poor
boy
i
will
say
that
for
her
the
result
is
that
he
quite
good
and
steady
now
and
every
one
says
he
make
a
guardsman
i
writing
a
long
screed
alex
but
i
really
feel
you
ought
to
be
posted
up
in
all
the
family
news
if
you
really
going
to
come
and
join
forces
with
us
again
after
all
these
years
it
seems
quite
funny
to
think
of
so
many
things
have
happened
since
you
left
home
for
good
as
we
thought
it
was
going
to
be
do
write
again
and
tell
me
what
you
think
of
doing
and
when
you
coming
over
my
tiny
will
be
quite
ready
for
you
any
time
you
like
your
loving
sister
barbara
mcallister
barbara
letter
was
astounding
even
alex
too
jaded
for
any
great
poignancy
of
emotion
felt
amazement
at
her
sister
acceptance
of
a
state
of
affairs
that
had
been
brought
about
by
such
moral
and
physical
upheaval
had
barbara
realized
none
of
it
or
was
she
merely
utterly
incurious
alex
could
only
feel
thankful
that
no
long
explanatory
letter
need
be
written
perhaps
when
she
got
back
to
england
it
would
be
easier
to
make
her
explanation
to
barbara
she
could
hardly
imagine
that
return
the
affair
of
the
release
from
her
vows
dragged
on
with
wearisome
indefiniteness
documents
and
papers
were
sent
for
her
signature
and
there
were
one
or
two
interviews
painful
and
humiliating
enough
none
of
them
however
hurt
her
as
that
interview
in
the
parlour
at
liège
with
father
farrell
had
done
for
to
none
of
them
did
she
bring
that
faint
shred
of
hope
that
had
underlain
her
last
attempt
to
make
clear
the
truth
as
she
knew
it
she
knew
that
money
had
been
paid
and
cedric
had
written
a
grave
and
short
note
bidding
her
leave
that
side
of
the
question
to
his
care
and
to
that
of
her
father
lawyers
then
with
dramatic
unexpectedness
came
the
end
she
was
told
that
all
the
necessary
formalities
had
been
complied
with
and
that
her
vows
were
now
annulled
it
was
carefully
explained
to
her
that
this
did
not
include
freedom
to
marry
the
church
would
sanction
no
union
of
hers
alex
could
have
laughed
she
felt
as
though
marriage
had
been
spoken
of
for
the
first
time
to
an
old
old
woman
who
had
never
known
love
and
to
whom
passion
and
desire
alike
had
long
been
as
strangers
why
should
that
which
had
never
come
to
her
eager
questing
youth
be
spoken
of
in
connection
with
the
strange
remote
self
which
was
all
that
was
left
of
her
now
she
reflected
how
transitory
had
been
the
relations
into
which
she
had
entered
how
little
any
intimacy
of
spirit
had
ever
bound
her
to
another
human
being
her
first
love
i
love
you
for
your
few
caresses
i
love
you
for
my
many
tears
where
was
now
alex
knew
nothing
of
her
no
doubt
she
had
married
had
borne
children
and
somewhere
in
her
native
soissons
was
gay
and
prosperous
still
alex
dimly
hoped
so
queenie
torrance
her
thoughts
even
now
dwelt
tenderly
for
a
moment
on
that
fair
irresponsive
object
of
so
much
devotion
on
queenie
as
a
pale
demure
schoolgirl
her
fair
curls
rolled
back
from
her
white
open
brow
in
her
dress
and
apron
on
queenie
the
blue
ribbon
for
good
conduct
lying
across
her
breast
serenely
telling
fibs
or
surreptitiously
carrying
off
the
forbidden
sweets
and
dainties
procured
for
her
by
alex
or
gazing
with
cold
vexation
on
some
extravagant
demonstration
of
affection
that
had
failed
to
win
her
approval
in
retrospect
alex
could
see
queenie
again
the
white
voluminous
ball
dresses
she
had
worn
the
tiny
wreath
of
blue
once
condemned
as
bad
form
by
lady
isabel
on
queenie
goldstein
her
thoughts
dwelt
little
she
had
heard
long
ago
from
barbara
of
queenie
divorce
in
an
action
brought
by
her
husband
which
had
afforded
the
chief
scandal
of
the
year
and
then
no
one
had
heard
or
even
seen
anything
of
queenie
for
a
long
while
and
barbara
had
said
that
she
was
reported
to
be
abroad
with
her
father
five
years
later
barbara
had
written
excitedly
you
remember
that
awful
queenie
goldstein
and
how
full
the
papers
were
of
her
pictures
when
that
dreadful
divorce
case
of
hers
was
on
and
the
five
and
everything
you
hardly
believe
it
but
in
london
again
having
succeeded
in
marrying
an
american
whom
every
one
says
is
coming
millionaire
i
saw
her
at
the
theatre
myself
in
a
box
absolutely
slung
with
diamonds
she
taken
to
making
up
her
face
tremendously
but
she
has
altered
much
and
she
received
everywhere
they
say
her
husband
simply
adores
her
alex
still
remembered
the
rebuke
with
which
mother
gertrude
had
handed
her
that
letter
bidding
her
remind
her
sister
that
things
of
the
world
worldly
had
no
place
in
the
life
of
a
nun
nevertheless
although
she
had
put
the
thought
from
her
she
knew
that
in
her
heart
she
had
felt
a
certain
gladness
that
her
erstwhile
playmate
given
over
though
she
might
be
to
the
world
the
flesh
and
the
devil
had
yet
not
found
those
things
that
she
coveted
to
have
failed
her
queenie
at
least
had
known
what
she
wanted
and
alex
thoughts
of
her
held
no
condemnation
from
queenie
her
mind
went
to
the
memory
of
noel
cardew
and
she
was
faintly
surprised
at
the
unvivid
presentment
of
him
which
was
all
that
she
could
evoke
noel
had
held
no
real
place
in
her
life
at
all
nothing
that
would
endure
had
ever
passed
between
him
and
her
it
was
years
since
she
had
thought
of
their
engagement
and
then
it
had
always
been
in
connection
with
sir
francis
and
lady
isabel
their
brief
pride
and
pleasure
in
it
and
the
sudden
downfall
of
their
hopes
of
noel
himself
she
had
scarcely
a
recollection
perhaps
her
clearest
one
was
that
of
the
earnest
young
egoist
only
made
attractive
by
a
certain
simplicity
who
had
taken
her
to
sit
in
a
disused
one
hot
summer
day
and
had
talked
about
photography
of
the
later
noel
alex
was
astounded
to
find
that
she
retained
no
impression
at
all
she
could
not
even
remember
whether
it
was
he
or
his
brother
eric
who
had
married
marie
munroe
in
the
same
year
that
she
herself
had
taken
her
first
vows
as
a
nun
perhaps
it
was
noel
at
all
events
he
had
probably
married
long
ago
and
alex
could
believe
that
some
corner
of
land
in
devonshire
was
the
better
for
the
earnest
supervision
that
he
would
accord
to
it
both
in
his
own
person
and
in
that
of
the
generation
that
would
doubtless
succeed
him
mother
gertrude
at
the
last
and
most
worshipped
of
the
shrines
before
which
alex
had
offered
the
sad
futile
unmeasured
of
her
life
her
thoughts
lingered
least
it
had
all
been
a
mistake
she
had
given
recklessly
foolishly
squandering
her
all
because
life
had
cheated
her
of
any
outlet
for
a
force
of
the
strength
of
which
she
had
had
no
measure
given
her
and
now
she
had
to
pay
the
bitter
penalty
for
a
folly
which
had
not
even
been
met
by
answering
human
affection
she
wrote
no
letter
to
mother
gertrude
and
received
no
word
from
her
as
the
days
crept
on
alex
without
volition
of
her
own
found
that
her
journey
to
england
had
been
arranged
for
that
money
was
to
be
advanced
to
her
for
her
expenses
that
she
was
expected
to
supplement
with
it
her
utter
penury
of
worldly
possessions
one
day
she
went
out
frightened
and
at
a
loss
and
entered
some
of
the
first
shops
she
saw
in
a
street
that
led
down
from
the
pincio
gates
they
were
not
large
shops
and
she
had
difficulty
in
making
herself
understood
but
she
purchased
a
skirt
with
a
coat
that
she
called
a
jacket
and
an
ugly
black
toque
that
most
resembled
in
shape
those
that
she
remembered
seeing
in
london
ten
years
earlier
she
wore
these
clothes
with
a
white
cotton
blouse
that
fastened
at
the
back
and
came
high
up
under
her
chin
for
some
days
before
she
left
rome
so
as
to
grow
accustomed
to
them
and
to
lose
the
sense
of
awkwardness
that
they
produced
in
her
the
heavy
boots
and
a
pair
of
gloves
that
she
had
brought
from
belgium
still
served
her
the
day
of
her
departure
was
fixed
and
she
wrote
to
barbara
but
she
knew
neither
by
what
route
she
was
going
nor
how
long
the
journey
would
take
her
companions
selected
by
the
superior
of
the
convent
proved
to
be
an
old
lady
and
her
daughter
who
were
going
to
paris
evidently
they
knew
her
story
for
they
looked
at
her
with
scared
curious
faces
and
spoke
to
her
very
little
both
were
experienced
travellers
and
on
the
long
hot
journey
in
the
train
when
it
seemed
as
though
the
seats
of
the
railway
carriage
were
made
of
molten
iron
they
extended
themselves
with
cushions
and
little
paper
fans
and
slept
most
of
the
way
at
genoa
the
daughter
timidly
but
with
kindness
pressed
alex
to
eat
and
drink
and
after
that
she
spoke
to
her
once
or
twice
and
gave
her
a
friendly
invitation
to
join
them
at
the
small
in
paris
to
which
they
were
bound
for
a
night
halt
before
she
proceeded
to
boulogne
and
thence
to
england
alex
accepted
with
bewildered
thankfulness
she
was
weak
and
exhausted
and
the
old
lady
and
her
daughter
were
pitiful
enough
and
saw
her
into
the
train
next
day
and
gave
her
the
provision
of
sandwiches
which
she
had
not
thought
to
make
for
herself
the
train
sped
through
flat
green
country
with
tall
poplars
shading
the
small
narrow
french
houses
that
dotted
the
line
on
either
side
her
eye
dilated
as
she
gazed
on
the
sea
when
at
last
boulogne
was
reached
she
remembered
the
same
grey
expanse
of
rolling
waves
tipped
with
foam
on
the
morning
eight
years
ago
when
the
girl
alex
clare
had
crossed
to
belgium
tearful
indeed
and
frightened
but
believing
herself
to
be
making
that
new
beginning
which
should
lead
to
the
eventual
goal
which
life
must
surely
hold
in
store
for
her
only
eight
years
and
the
bitterness
of
a
lifetime
failure
encompassed
her
spirit
xxiii
alex
got
off
the
boat
at
folkestone
dazed
and
bewildered
she
had
been
ill
all
through
the
crossing
and
her
head
was
still
swimming
she
grasped
her
heavy
clumsy
and
was
thankful
to
have
no
luggage
when
she
saw
the
seething
crowd
of
passengers
running
after
uniformed
porters
in
search
of
heavy
baggage
that
was
being
flung
on
to
trucks
to
an
accompaniment
of
noise
and
shouting
that
frightened
her
she
made
her
way
to
the
train
and
into
a
carriage
too
much
afraid
of
its
starting
without
her
to
dare
to
go
in
search
of
the
hot
tea
which
she
saw
the
passengers
drinking
thankfully
it
was
a
raw
grey
day
and
alex
in
her
thin
serge
coat
and
skirt
that
had
been
so
much
too
hot
in
italy
shivered
violently
her
gloves
were
nearly
and
her
hands
felt
clammy
and
stiff
she
took
off
her
little
toque
and
leant
her
head
against
the
back
of
the
seat
wishing
that
she
could
sleep
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
other
people
in
the
carriage
were
looking
at
her
suspiciously
and
she
closed
her
eyes
so
as
not
to
see
them
after
a
long
while
the
train
started
alex
tried
to
make
plans
in
the
shabby
purse
which
she
had
clasped
in
her
hand
all
the
way
for
fear
of
its
being
stolen
was
a
piece
of
paper
with
barbara
address
she
would
not
go
to
clevedon
square
for
fear
of
cedric
unknown
wife
cedric
with
a
wife
and
child
alex
marvelled
and
could
not
believe
that
she
might
soon
make
the
acquaintance
of
these
beings
who
seemed
to
her
so
nearly
mythical
the
thought
of
barbara
as
a
widow
living
in
a
little
house
of
her
own
in
hampstead
seemed
far
less
unfamiliar
barbara
had
always
written
regularly
to
alex
and
had
twice
been
to
see
her
when
she
was
in
the
english
house
and
once
in
her
early
days
in
belgium
barbara
had
often
said
in
her
letters
that
she
was
very
lonely
and
that
it
was
terrible
having
to
live
so
far
out
of
town
because
of
expenses
ralph
poor
dear
had
left
her
very
very
badly
off
and
there
had
been
very
little
more
for
her
on
the
death
of
sir
francis
alex
supposed
that
downshire
hill
must
be
a
very
unfashionable
address
but
she
did
not
connect
with
any
particular
locality
she
was
always
very
stupid
at
finding
her
way
about
and
anyhow
her
bag
was
heavy
she
decided
that
she
would
take
a
cab
at
charing
cross
it
was
raining
and
the
noise
was
deafening
alex
had
meant
to
send
barbara
a
telegram
from
folkestone
but
had
not
known
where
to
find
the
telegraph
office
and
she
now
realized
with
a
pang
of
dismay
that
her
sister
would
not
be
expecting
her
how
stupid
i
am
and
how
badly
i
manage
things
she
thought
i
hope
she
wo
be
out
the
number
of
taxis
at
the
station
bewildered
alex
who
had
only
seen
one
or
two
crawling
about
the
streets
in
rome
and
had
heard
of
them
besides
as
ruinously
expensive
she
found
a
cab
and
put
her
bag
on
the
floor
the
man
did
not
get
down
from
his
box
to
open
the
door
for
her
as
she
expected
he
leant
down
and
asked
hoarsely
where
want
to
go
miss
downshire
hill
said
alex
no
downshire
where
that
i
do
know
said
alex
frightened
she
wondered
if
the
man
was
drunk
and
prepared
to
pull
her
bag
out
of
the
cab
again
a
minute
he
called
out
something
unintelligible
to
another
driver
and
received
an
answer
downshire
he
then
informed
her
out
yes
said
alex
ca
you
take
me
there
he
looked
at
her
shabby
clothes
and
white
frightened
face
i
like
to
see
my
fare
first
if
please
he
said
insolently
alex
was
too
much
afraid
of
his
making
a
scene
to
refuse
how
much
will
it
be
seven
and
sixpence
miss
she
pulled
two
out
of
her
purse
it
was
all
she
had
left
this
is
all
the
change
i
have
she
told
him
in
a
shaking
voice
they
will
pay
the
rest
when
i
get
there
he
muttered
something
dissatisfied
but
put
the
coins
into
his
pocket
alex
climbed
into
the
cab
it
jolted
away
very
slowly
the
rain
was
falling
fast
and
dashing
against
the
windows
of
the
cab
alex
glanced
out
but
the
streets
through
which
they
were
driving
were
all
unfamiliar
to
her
it
seemed
a
very
long
way
to
downshire
hill
she
began
to
wonder
very
much
how
barbara
would
receive
her
and
how
she
could
make
clear
to
her
the
long
restless
agony
that
had
led
her
to
obtain
release
from
her
vows
would
barbara
understand
letters
had
been
very
inadequate
and
although
barbara
had
written
that
alex
had
better
come
to
her
for
a
while
if
she
meant
to
return
to
england
she
had
given
no
hint
of
any
deeper
comprehension
we
must
make
plans
when
we
meet
she
had
written
at
the
end
of
the
letter
alex
wondered
with
a
sense
of
apprehension
what
those
plans
would
be
she
had
for
so
long
become
accustomed
to
being
treated
as
a
chattel
without
volition
of
her
own
that
it
did
not
occur
to
her
that
she
would
have
any
hand
in
forming
her
future
life
presently
she
became
conscious
that
the
rain
had
stopped
and
that
the
atmosphere
was
lighter
she
let
down
the
glass
of
the
window
nearest
her
and
saw
with
surprise
that
there
was
a
rolling
expanse
of
green
with
a
number
of
on
one
side
of
the
road
it
did
not
look
like
london
then
the
cab
turned
a
corner
and
alex
saw
downshire
hill
on
a
small
board
against
the
wall
this
was
where
barbara
lived
then
the
little
houses
were
small
and
compact
but
of
agreeably
varying
height
and
shape
with
a
tiny
enclosure
of
green
in
front
of
each
protected
by
railings
and
a
little
gate
no
before
which
the
cab
drew
up
had
a
bush
that
alex
thought
must
be
lilac
and
was
covered
with
ivy
there
were
red
blinds
to
the
windows
she
got
out
pulling
her
heavy
bag
after
her
and
timidly
pushed
open
the
little
gate
glancing
up
at
the
windows
as
she
did
so
there
was
no
one
to
be
seen
still
clutching
at
her
alex
pulled
the
bell
faintly
there
half
my
fare
owing
yet
said
the
cabman
gruffly
thus
reminded
alex
rang
again
an
elderly
with
hair
and
a
hard
face
opened
the
door
is
is
macallister
at
home
faltered
alex
i
inquire
said
the
maid
with
a
lightning
glance
at
the
she
left
the
door
open
and
alex
saw
a
little
flight
of
stairs
a
murmured
colloquy
took
place
at
the
top
and
then
barbara
slight
and
severely
came
down
alex
that
not
you
yes
oh
barbara
my
dear
i
been
expecting
to
hear
from
you
every
day
i
been
imagining
all
sorts
of
awful
things
why
did
you
wire
do
come
in
you
must
be
dead
and
have
you
been
carrying
that
huge
bag
i
came
from
the
station
in
a
cab
a
cab
echoed
barbara
in
rather
a
dismayed
voice
what
a
long
way
to
come
when
you
could
have
done
it
so
easily
by
the
underground
railway
but
i
suppose
you
did
know
no
repeated
alex
blankly
i
did
know
what
he
waiting
for
will
he
carry
your
trunk
upstairs
that
is
all
the
luggage
i
have
and
i
can
carry
it
up
quite
well
and
it
is
heavy
but
i
had
quite
enough
money
for
the
fare
he
ought
to
have
another
oh
dear
said
barbara
wait
a
minute
then
alex
she
disappeared
up
the
stairs
leaving
alex
alone
with
the
severe
who
still
held
open
the
front
door
she
leant
against
the
wall
in
the
tiny
passage
wondering
what
she
had
expected
of
her
actual
arrival
that
the
reality
should
give
her
such
a
sense
of
misery
if
only
she
had
telegraphed
to
barbara
from
folkestone
here
two
shillings
ada
have
you
got
a
sixpence
by
any
chance
there
sixpence
in
the
kitchen
said
ada
and
fetched
it
there
said
barbara
pay
him
then
please
ada
now
alex
come
upstairs
and
sit
down
you
look
dreadfully
ill
and
my
dear
alex
lifted
the
again
oh
ada
will
see
to
that
your
room
is
all
ready
alex
it
very
small
but
then
the
house
is
a
perfect
doll
house
as
you
see
this
is
my
tiny
it
very
pretty
said
alex
sinking
into
a
chair
it
not
bad
the
things
are
nice
enough
ralph
had
some
exquisite
things
but
of
course
the
house
is
too
hateful
and
i
hate
living
all
the
way
out
here
no
one
ever
comes
near
me
cedric
wife
ca
get
her
chauffeur
to
bring
her
he
pretends
he
does
know
where
it
is
the
only
person
who
ever
comes
is
pamela
i
thought
she
was
to
live
with
you
pam
oh
she
would
bury
herself
out
here
for
long
pam
very
much
in
request
my
dear
she
been
paying
visits
all
over
the
place
and
can
go
on
indefinitely
i
believe
she
makes
her
headquarters
with
cedric
and
violet
in
clevedon
square
you
know
but
of
course
marry
pam
all
right
last
time
i
saw
pam
she
was
in
short
frocks
and
a
pigtail
she
come
out
in
the
most
extraordinary
way
every
one
says
so
not
exactly
pretty
but
frightfully
taking
and
most
awfully
attractive
to
men
they
say
she
so
full
of
life
i
must
say
when
came
out
alex
we
did
have
nearly
such
a
good
time
as
she
has
men
seem
to
go
down
like
ninepins
before
her
she
always
bringing
them
out
here
to
tea
and
to
look
at
the
view
of
london
from
the
heath
one
always
used
to
look
on
hampstead
heath
as
a
sort
of
joke
phil
may
drawings
and
that
kind
of
thing
i
certainly
never
expected
to
live
here
but
lots
of
artists
do
and
ralph
had
a
big
studio
here
and
it
very
inexpensive
besides
if
you
know
you
way
about
it
quite
easy
to
come
in
and
out
from
town
pamela
always
brings
her
young
men
on
the
top
of
a
girls
can
do
anything
of
course
fancy
father
if
one
of
had
done
such
a
thing
who
looks
after
her
asked
alex
rather
she
looks
after
herself
my
dear
and
does
it
uncommonly
effectively
she
could
marry
tomorrow
if
she
liked
and
marry
well
too
of
course
cedric
is
her
guardian
in
a
sort
of
way
i
suppose
but
he
lets
her
do
anything
she
like
only
laughs
cedric
spoke
alex
wistfully
do
you
know
i
have
seen
cedric
since
i
left
clevedon
square
my
dear
that
ten
years
is
it
cedric
grown
exactly
like
father
he
got
just
his
way
of
standing
in
front
of
the
fire
and
shaking
his
spectacles
up
and
down
in
his
hand
you
remember
way
of
course
he
done
extraordinarily
well
every
one
says
so
and
his
marriage
was
an
excellent
thing
too
is
violet
nice
barbara
laughed
rather
drily
she
got
a
lot
of
money
and
yes
i
suppose
she
is
nice
between
ourselves
alex
she
the
sort
of
person
who
rather
aggravates
me
she
always
so
prosperous
and
happy
as
though
nothing
had
ever
gone
wrong
with
her
or
ever
could
she
very
generous
i
will
say
that
for
her
and
extraordinarily
most
people
adore
her
she
the
sort
of
woman
that
other
women
rave
about
but
i
must
say
most
men
like
her
too
her
people
were
rather
inclined
to
think
she
could
have
done
better
for
herself
than
cedric
of
course
he
is
well
off
and
two
years
older
than
he
is
but
it
answered
all
right
and
they
were
tremendously
in
love
with
one
another
is
she
very
pretty
she
inclined
to
be
fat
but
of
course
she
is
pretty
in
her
own
style
very
and
the
little
girl
is
a
perfect
darling
little
rosemary
but
alex
here
am
i
talking
you
to
death
when
you
must
be
dying
for
tea
what
sort
of
a
crossing
did
you
have
not
very
bad
but
i
was
ill
all
the
way
oh
no
wonder
you
look
so
washed
out
said
barbara
as
though
relieved
but
she
went
on
eyeing
her
sister
uneasily
through
the
rapidly
increasing
dusk
when
ada
came
in
with
the
tea
appointments
barbara
told
her
to
bring
the
lamp
yes
and
your
bag
may
i
have
the
key
alex
looked
bewildered
then
recollected
that
the
maid
was
offering
to
unpack
for
her
and
pulled
out
the
key
from
her
purse
is
there
your
trunk
still
to
come
asked
barbara
no
you
see
i
had
much
to
bring
only
just
one
or
two
things
that
i
got
in
rome
alex
wondered
if
barbara
understood
that
until
a
few
months
ago
she
had
been
a
nun
living
the
life
of
a
nun
she
thought
of
the
apprehension
with
which
she
had
viewed
making
an
explanation
to
barbara
and
almost
smiled
it
appeared
that
no
explanation
would
be
required
of
her
but
presently
barbara
said
uneasily
it
seems
extraordinary
your
having
no
luggage
like
this
alex
i
know
what
ada
will
think
i
sure
i
told
her
that
you
been
living
abroad
for
a
good
many
years
i
thought
that
was
the
best
thing
to
say
but
i
never
thought
of
your
having
no
luggage
i
had
got
anything
to
bring
you
see
i
must
get
some
things
repeated
alex
forlornly
you
see
said
her
sister
half
apologetically
ada
been
with
me
ever
since
i
married
she
was
ralph
mother
maid
and
perfectly
devoted
to
him
i
could
ever
get
that
sort
of
servant
to
live
out
here
if
it
was
for
that
she
waits
at
meals
and
maids
me
and
does
everything
except
the
actual
cooking
i
know
she
rather
disagreeable
in
her
manner
but
she
a
perfect
treasure
to
me
when
ada
had
brought
in
the
lamps
and
filled
the
little
room
with
cheerful
light
drawing
the
blinds
and
curtains
barbara
looked
again
hard
at
her
sister
good
heavens
alex
how
thin
you
are
and
you
look
as
though
you
slept
for
a
month
oh
but
i
have
said
alex
eagerly
and
then
stopped
she
did
not
feel
able
to
explain
to
barbara
the
insatiable
powers
of
sleep
which
seemed
as
though
they
could
never
be
satisfied
after
those
ten
years
of
unvarying
obedience
to
a
merciless
five
bell
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
barbara
replied
in
a
dissatisfied
voice
but
i
never
saw
any
one
so
changed
have
you
been
ill
rather
run
down
alex
said
hurriedly
with
the
convent
instinct
of
denying
physical
ills
i
had
two
or
three
very
troublesome
abscesses
in
my
throat
just
before
easter
and
that
left
me
rather
weak
my
dear
how
awful
you
never
told
me
did
you
have
an
operation
are
you
scarred
no
they
broke
of
themselves
my
throat
luckily
oh
do
cried
barbara
and
shuddered
the
sisters
were
very
silent
during
tea
alex
saw
her
sister
looking
hard
at
her
hands
and
became
conscious
of
contrast
barbara
was
thin
but
her
hands
were
slender
and
exceedingly
white
she
wore
besides
her
a
sapphire
one
which
alex
thought
must
have
been
her
on
her
wrist
was
a
tiny
gold
watch
and
a
gold
bracelet
her
own
hands
alex
now
saw
were
more
than
thin
they
were
almost
emaciated
with
knuckles
that
shone
white
and
a
sharp
prominence
at
each
they
were
not
white
but
rough
and
mottled
with
broken
skin
round
each
she
wondered
if
her
whole
person
was
in
as
striking
a
contrast
to
her
sister
when
she
had
put
on
the
serge
skirt
and
white
muslin
shirt
the
sensation
had
overwhelmed
her
accustomed
to
the
heavy
religious
habit
of
being
lightly
almost
indecently
clad
but
barbara
dress
was
of
soft
silky
material
with
a
low
collar
such
as
was
just
beginning
to
come
into
fashion
her
hair
was
piled
into
a
shining
knot
of
little
curls
and
parted
in
front
though
she
was
only
the
grey
in
barbara
hair
was
plentiful
but
her
small
face
looked
youthful
enough
and
had
none
of
the
hard
lines
and
shadows
that
alex
knew
to
lie
round
her
own
eyes
and
lips
her
little
slight
figure
was
very
erect
and
she
wore
black
suède
shoes
with
sparkling
buckles
alex
looked
down
at
her
own
clumsy
boots
which
had
already
begun
to
hurt
her
feet
and
instinctively
put
up
her
hands
to
the
cheap
black
toque
that
felt
heavy
on
her
head
why
do
you
take
off
your
hat
barbara
asked
her
kindly
i
am
sure
it
would
rest
you
she
was
too
much
used
to
obedience
not
to
comply
instantly
pushing
back
with
both
hands
the
weight
of
untidy
hair
that
instantly
fell
over
her
eyes
oh
alex
your
hair
it
growing
very
fast
i
i
not
been
cutting
it
lately
just
enough
to
put
it
up
barbara
it
much
darker
than
it
used
to
be
is
it
yes
it
nearly
black
now
do
you
remember
how
light
the
ends
used
to
be
but
i
think
it
lost
its
colour
from
being
always
under
the
veil
you
know
the
worst
of
it
is
that
it
not
growing
evenly
it
all
short
lengths
yes
that
very
awkward
said
barbara
dispassionately
especially
when
it
so
straight
alex
reflected
that
her
sister
was
just
as
as
ever
would
you
like
to
come
to
your
room
and
rest
till
dinner
alex
alex
got
up
at
once
you
ought
to
take
plasmon
or
something
of
that
sort
and
try
to
get
a
little
fatter
there
simply
nothing
of
you
alex
you
all
eyes
with
rings
like
saucers
round
them
after
barbara
had
left
her
in
the
tiny
pretty
bedroom
that
alex
thought
looked
wonderfully
luxurious
she
went
straight
to
her
good
heavens
how
ugly
i
am
she
said
to
herself
involuntarily
her
face
was
sallow
with
sunken
cheeks
and
the
roman
sun
had
powdered
her
skin
all
over
with
little
pale
freckles
her
eyes
as
barbara
had
said
had
rings
like
saucers
round
them
and
looked
oddly
large
and
prominent
from
the
slight
puffiness
of
the
her
teeth
had
perhaps
suffered
most
of
all
she
had
had
one
or
two
taken
out
and
the
gaps
were
visible
and
unsightly
they
had
never
been
very
good
teeth
and
she
remembered
still
all
that
she
had
suffered
at
the
hands
of
an
unskilled
brussels
dentist
in
belgium
for
the
last
few
years
she
had
endured
intermittent
toothache
sooner
than
submit
to
further
torture
and
she
saw
now
that
a
small
black
patch
was
spreading
between
the
two
front
teeth
barbara
with
the
grey
mingled
freely
in
her
light
hair
and
her
severe
widow
weeds
might
look
more
than
but
alex
at
bore
the
semblance
of
a
woman
of
forty
she
hid
her
face
in
her
disfigured
hands
presently
she
saw
that
there
was
hot
water
in
a
little
brass
can
on
the
and
she
thankfully
made
use
of
it
ada
had
unpacked
everything
and
alex
saw
the
brush
and
comb
that
she
had
hastily
purchased
on
the
beside
them
was
the
packet
of
that
she
had
remembered
to
get
at
the
last
moment
and
that
was
all
there
ought
to
be
something
else
but
i
forgotten
thought
alex
she
wondered
if
barbara
would
expect
her
to
dress
for
dinner
the
idea
had
not
occurred
to
her
she
had
one
other
blouse
a
much
better
one
made
of
black
net
so
transparent
as
to
show
glimpses
of
her
coarse
underwear
with
its
high
yoke
and
long
sleeves
her
hair
of
course
was
impossible
even
if
it
had
not
been
so
short
and
of
such
an
intractable
limp
straightness
alex
had
forgotten
how
to
do
it
she
remembered
with
dim
surprise
that
at
clevedon
square
lady
isabel
maid
had
always
done
her
hair
for
her
she
brushed
it
away
from
her
face
and
made
a
small
coil
on
the
top
of
her
head
after
the
fashion
which
she
remembered
best
and
tried
to
fasten
back
the
untidy
lengths
that
fell
over
her
ears
and
forehead
the
that
she
had
bought
were
very
long
and
thick
she
wished
that
they
did
not
show
so
obviously
alex
said
barbara
cool
voice
at
her
door
alex
came
out
and
they
went
downstairs
together
alex
a
few
steps
behind
her
sister
since
the
stairs
were
not
broad
enough
for
two
to
walk
abreast
she
tried
awkwardly
not
to
step
on
the
tail
of
black
lace
teagown
ada
waited
upon
them
and
although
the
helpings
of
food
seemed
infinitesimal
to
alex
everything
tasted
delicious
and
she
wondered
if
barbara
always
had
three
courses
as
well
as
a
dessert
of
fruit
and
coffee
even
when
she
was
by
herself
you
do
smoke
i
suppose
barbara
said
no
of
course
not
how
stupid
of
me
let
go
up
to
the
again
barbara
do
you
smoke
no
ralph
hated
women
to
smoke
and
i
do
like
to
see
it
myself
though
pretty
nearly
every
one
does
it
now
violet
smokes
too
much
i
wonder
cedric
lets
her
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
lets
her
do
anything
she
likes
i
ca
realize
cedric
married
i
know
look
here
alex
he
want
to
see
you
and
you
be
wanting
to
talk
over
plans
wo
you
yes
said
alex
nervously
i
i
do
want
to
have
a
lot
of
fuss
you
know
of
course
i
know
it
upsetting
for
everybody
my
coming
out
of
the
convent
after
every
one
thought
i
was
settled
but
oh
barbara
i
to
leave
personally
i
ca
think
why
you
ever
went
in
said
barbara
impersonally
or
why
you
took
ten
years
to
find
out
you
were
suited
to
the
life
that
sounds
unkind
and
i
do
mean
to
be
you
know
i
do
of
course
you
were
right
to
come
away
only
i
afraid
ruined
your
health
you
so
dreadfully
thin
and
you
look
much
older
than
you
any
right
to
alex
i
believe
you
ought
to
go
into
the
country
somewhere
and
have
a
regular
every
one
is
doing
them
now
however
we
see
what
cedric
and
violet
say
when
shall
i
see
them
asked
alex
nervously
well
said
her
sister
hesitating
what
about
tomorrow
it
better
to
get
it
over
at
once
is
it
i
thought
i
ring
them
up
this
evening
i
know
they
dining
at
home
she
glanced
at
the
clock
look
here
alex
why
do
you
go
to
bed
i
always
go
early
myself
and
you
simply
dead
tired
do
then
tomorrow
we
might
go
into
town
and
do
some
shopping
you
want
some
things
at
once
wo
you
alex
saw
that
barbara
meant
her
to
assent
and
said
yes
in
a
dazed
way
she
was
very
glad
to
go
to
her
room
and
the
bed
seemed
extraordinarily
comfortable
barbara
had
kissed
her
and
said
anxiously
i
do
hope
you
feel
more
like
yourself
tomorrow
my
dear
i
hardly
feel
i
know
you
then
she
had
rustled
away
and
alex
had
heard
her
go
downstairs
perhaps
to
telephone
to
clevedon
square
lying
in
bed
in
the
dark
she
thought
about
her
sister
it
seemed
incredible
to
alex
that
she
could
ever
have
bullied
and
domineered
over
barbara
yet
in
their
common
childhood
this
had
happened
she
could
remember
stamping
her
foot
at
barbara
and
compelling
her
to
follow
her
sister
lead
again
and
again
and
there
was
the
time
when
she
had
forced
a
terrified
reluctant
barbara
to
play
at
dancing
on
the
stairs
and
barbara
had
obediently
clambered
on
to
the
and
fallen
backwards
into
the
hall
and
hurt
her
back
alex
remembered
still
the
agonized
days
and
nights
of
despairing
remorse
which
had
followed
and
her
own
sense
of
being
all
but
a
murderess
she
had
thought
then
that
she
could
never
never
quarrel
and
be
angry
with
barbara
again
but
she
had
gone
away
to
school
and
barbara
had
got
well
and
in
the
holidays
alex
had
been
more
overbearing
than
ever
in
the
schoolroom
and
now
barbara
seemed
so
infinitely
competent
so
remote
from
the
failures
and
emotional
disasters
that
had
wrecked
alex
she
made
alex
feel
like
a
child
in
the
hands
of
a
serious
rather
ironical
person
who
did
not
quite
know
how
to
dispose
of
it
alex
herself
wondered
what
would
happen
to
her
much
as
a
child
might
have
wondered
but
she
was
tired
enough
to
sleep
and
the
next
morning
barbara
more
competent
than
ever
came
in
and
suggested
that
she
should
have
her
breakfast
in
bed
so
as
to
feel
rested
enough
for
a
morning
shopping
in
town
though
i
must
say
said
barbara
in
a
dissatisfied
voice
that
you
do
look
any
better
than
you
did
last
night
i
hoped
you
might
look
more
like
yourself
after
a
night
rest
i
really
do
think
the
others
will
know
you
am
i
going
to
see
them
oh
i
talked
to
violet
last
night
on
the
telephone
and
she
said
i
was
to
give
you
her
love
and
she
hoped
we
both
lunch
there
tomorrow
at
clevedon
square
asked
alex
beginning
to
tremble
yes
you
do
mind
do
you
no
i
do
mind
it
was
very
strange
to
be
in
the
remembered
london
streets
again
stranger
still
to
be
taken
to
shops
by
barbara
and
authoritatively
guided
in
the
choice
of
a
coat
and
skirt
a
hat
that
should
conceal
as
much
as
possible
of
the
disastrous
underneath
and
a
pair
of
black
suède
that
felt
oddly
light
and
soft
to
her
feet
there
no
hurry
about
the
other
things
is
there
said
barbara
more
as
though
stating
a
fact
than
asking
a
question
now
we
better
take
a
taxi
to
clevedon
square
or
we
shall
be
late
a
few
minutes
later
as
the
taxi
turned
into
the
square
she
said
with
what
alex
recognized
in
surprise
as
a
kind
of
nervousness
in
her
voice
we
thought
you
rather
get
it
all
over
at
once
you
know
alex
seeing
the
family
i
mean
pam
is
staying
there
anyway
and
violet
said
archie
was
coming
to
lunch
there
be
nobody
else
except
perhaps
one
of
violet
brothers
she
always
got
one
or
other
of
them
there
alex
felt
sick
with
dismay
then
some
remnant
of
courage
came
back
to
her
and
she
clenched
her
hands
unseen
and
vowed
that
she
would
go
through
with
it
the
cab
stopped
before
the
familiar
steps
and
barbara
said
as
to
a
stranger
here
we
are
xxiv
all
of
them
the
hall
and
broad
staircase
swam
before
alex
eyes
as
she
followed
barbara
upstairs
and
heard
them
announced
as
mcallister
and
miss
clare
in
a
dream
she
entered
the
room
and
was
conscious
of
a
feeling
of
relief
at
its
totally
unfamiliar
aspect
all
the
furniture
was
different
and
there
was
chintz
instead
of
brocade
everywhere
she
would
not
have
known
it
then
she
saw
with
growing
bewilderment
that
the
room
was
full
of
people
alex
said
a
soft
unknown
voice
barbara
hovered
uneasily
beside
her
and
alex
dimly
heard
her
speaking
and
but
violet
clare
had
taken
her
hand
and
was
guiding
her
into
the
inner
half
of
the
room
which
was
empty
do
bother
about
the
others
for
a
minute
barbara
go
and
look
after
them
like
a
dear
let
make
acquaintance
in
peace
alex
do
you
know
who
i
am
cedric
wife
yes
that
it
then
as
barbara
left
them
violet
noiselessly
stamped
her
foot
you
poor
dear
i
do
believe
she
ever
told
you
there
was
to
be
a
whole
crowd
of
family
here
that
just
like
poor
dear
barbara
i
sure
she
never
had
one
atom
of
imagination
in
her
life
now
had
she
the
idea
of
dragging
you
here
the
very
day
after
you
got
back
from
such
a
journey
the
soft
fluent
voice
went
on
giving
her
time
to
recover
herself
alex
hardly
hearing
what
was
said
to
her
but
with
a
sensation
of
adoring
gratitude
gradually
invading
her
for
this
warm
unhesitating
welcome
and
unquestioning
sympathy
she
looked
dumbly
at
her
in
violet
she
saw
the
soft
generous
contours
and
opulent
prettiness
of
which
she
had
caught
glimpses
in
the
south
the
numerous
marchesas
who
had
come
to
the
convent
parlour
in
rome
had
had
just
such
brown
liquid
eyes
with
dark
lashes
throwing
into
relief
an
opaque
ivory
skin
just
such
dazzling
teeth
and
such
ready
dimpling
smiles
and
had
worn
the
same
wealth
of
falling
laces
at
throat
and
white
rounded
wrists
violet
was
in
white
with
a
single
string
of
wonderful
pearls
round
her
soft
neck
and
her
brilliant
brown
hair
was
arranged
in
elaborate
waves
with
occasional
little
escaping
rings
and
tendrils
alex
thought
her
beautiful
and
wondered
why
barbara
had
spoken
in
deprecation
of
such
sleepy
prosperous
prettiness
she
noticed
that
violet
did
not
look
at
her
with
rather
wondering
dismay
as
her
sister
had
done
and
only
once
said
you
do
look
tired
you
poor
darling
it
that
hateful
journey
i
a
fearfully
bad
traveller
myself
when
we
were
married
cedric
wanted
to
go
to
the
south
of
france
for
our
honeymoon
but
i
told
him
nothing
would
induce
me
to
risk
being
seasick
and
he
had
to
take
me
to
cornwall
instead
cedric
will
be
here
in
a
minute
and
we
make
him
come
and
talk
to
you
quietly
out
here
you
do
want
to
go
in
amongst
all
that
rabble
do
you
who
is
there
asked
alex
faintly
pam
and
the
boys
that
my
two
brothers
you
know
whom
you
bother
about
the
very
least
bit
in
the
world
and
here
archie
she
added
as
the
door
opened
again
alex
would
have
known
archie
in
a
moment
anywhere
he
was
so
like
their
mother
even
the
first
inflection
of
his
voice
as
he
came
towards
violet
reminded
her
of
lady
isabel
she
had
not
seen
him
since
his
schooldays
and
wondered
if
he
would
have
recognized
her
without
violet
ready
explanation
alex
has
come
archie
that
goose
barbara
went
and
brought
her
here
without
explaining
that
she
only
just
got
back
to
england
and
is
naturally
tired
to
death
i
leave
you
to
talk
while
i
see
happened
to
cedric
i
say
exclaimed
archie
and
stood
looking
desperately
embarrassed
how
are
you
alex
old
girl
we
meet
as
strangers
what
i
should
have
known
you
anywhere
archie
you
so
like
barbara
so
like
mother
they
say
pam
exactly
like
what
mother
was
have
you
seen
her
no
not
yet
she
violet
brought
me
in
here
i
say
she
a
ripper
is
she
cedric
did
do
badly
for
himself
trust
him
wonder
what
the
beggar
be
up
to
next
he
done
jolly
well
all
along
the
line
retrieved
the
family
fortunes
what
it
only
remains
for
me
to
wed
an
american
and
pamela
to
bring
off
her
south
african
millionaire
she
got
one
after
her
did
you
know
he
spoke
with
a
certain
boyish
eagerness
that
was
rather
attractive
but
his
rapid
speech
and
restless
manner
made
alex
wonder
if
he
was
nervous
could
you
ask
pamela
to
come
to
me
here
so
that
i
could
see
her
without
all
those
people
what
people
it
only
old
jack
temple
and
carol
harmless
as
kittens
what
but
i
get
pam
for
you
in
two
twos
you
watch
he
put
his
fingers
into
his
mouth
and
emitted
a
peculiar
low
whistle
on
two
prolonged
notes
the
signal
was
instantly
answered
from
the
other
room
but
quaveringly
as
though
the
whistler
were
laughing
then
in
a
minute
she
appeared
very
slim
and
tall
in
the
opening
between
the
two
rooms
i
like
your
cheek
archie
i
say
pam
alex
is
here
oh
alex
pamela
too
looked
and
sounded
rather
embarrassed
as
she
came
forward
and
laid
a
fresh
glowing
cheek
against
her
sister
barbara
telephoned
last
night
that
you
come
and
seemed
awfully
seedy
she
said
in
a
quick
confused
way
she
ought
to
have
made
you
rest
today
oh
no
i
all
right
said
alex
awkwardly
how
you
changed
pamela
i
have
seen
you
since
you
were
at
school
looking
at
her
sister
she
secretly
rather
wondered
at
what
barbara
had
said
of
the
girl
attractiveness
pamela
round
face
was
glowing
with
health
and
colour
and
she
held
herself
very
upright
but
alex
thought
that
her
hair
looked
ugly
plastered
exaggeratedly
low
on
her
forehead
and
she
could
not
see
the
resemblance
to
their
mother
of
which
archie
had
spoken
except
in
the
fairness
of
colouring
which
pamela
shared
with
barbara
and
with
archie
himself
you
changed
too
alex
you
look
so
frightfully
thin
and
lost
all
your
colour
have
you
been
ill
no
i
not
been
only
rather
run
down
i
was
ill
before
easter
perhaps
that
it
alex
was
embarrassed
too
a
horrible
feeling
of
failure
and
inadequacy
creeping
over
her
and
seeming
to
hamper
her
in
every
word
and
movement
pamela
cold
rather
wondering
scrutiny
made
her
feel
terribly
unsure
of
herself
she
had
often
known
the
sensation
before
at
school
in
her
early
days
at
the
novitiate
again
in
rome
and
ever
since
her
arrival
in
england
it
was
the
helpless
insecurity
of
one
utterly
at
variance
with
her
surroundings
she
was
glad
when
violet
came
back
and
said
here
cedric
go
down
to
lunch
children
we
follow
you
cedric
greeting
to
his
sister
was
the
most
affectionate
and
the
least
awkward
that
she
had
yet
received
he
kissed
her
warmly
and
said
well
my
dear
i
glad
we
got
you
back
in
england
again
you
must
come
to
us
if
barbara
will
spare
you
oh
cedric
she
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
emotionally
shaken
that
cedric
should
have
grown
into
a
man
she
saw
in
a
moment
that
he
was
very
the
of
them
all
with
sir
francis
pleasantly
serious
expression
and
the
merest
shade
of
pomposity
in
his
manner
only
the
blinking
grey
eyes
behind
his
spectacles
remained
of
the
solemn
little
brother
she
had
known
come
down
and
have
some
lunch
dear
what
possessed
barbara
to
bring
you
here
if
you
did
feel
up
to
coming
we
could
have
gone
to
hampstead
violet
says
she
been
most
inconsiderate
to
you
yes
said
violet
herself
placidly
dear
barbara
is
always
so
unimaginative
of
course
it
fearfully
trying
for
alex
after
being
away
such
ages
to
have
every
one
thrust
upon
her
like
this
alex
felt
a
throb
of
gratitude
barbara
thought
it
had
better
all
be
got
over
at
once
she
said
timidly
that
just
like
her
barbara
is
being
completely
ruined
by
that
of
hers
ada
i
always
think
ada
is
responsible
for
all
barbara
worst
inspirations
she
rules
her
with
a
rod
of
iron
shall
you
hate
coming
down
to
lunch
alex
those
riotous
children
will
be
off
directly
they
wild
about
the
at
olympia
then
we
can
talk
comfortably
she
put
her
hand
caressingly
through
alex
arm
as
they
went
downstairs
alex
felt
that
she
could
have
worshipped
her
for
her
easy
pitying
tenderness
the
consciousness
of
it
helped
her
all
through
the
long
meal
when
the
noise
of
laughter
and
conversation
bewildered
her
after
so
many
years
of
convent
refectories
and
silence
and
her
solitary
dinners
in
rome
violet
had
placed
her
between
cedric
and
pamela
and
the
girl
chattered
to
her
intermittently
without
appearing
to
require
any
answer
are
you
boys
ready
she
cried
just
as
coffee
was
brought
in
we
ca
wait
for
coffee
come
on
my
instructor
will
be
engaged
how
are
you
going
pam
asked
violet
underground
it
the
quickest
oh
no
pam
take
a
taxi
archie
you
must
between
laughter
and
admonition
they
were
dispatched
pamela
archie
and
the
two
temple
boys
all
laughing
and
talking
and
exchanging
allusions
and
references
unintelligible
to
alex
the
room
seemed
much
quieter
and
darker
when
the
had
finally
slammed
behind
them
alex
looked
round
her
at
the
head
of
his
own
table
cedric
sat
reflective
violet
lounged
smoking
a
cigarette
and
laughing
where
lady
isabel
place
had
always
been
opposite
alex
barbara
in
her
prim
black
was
leaning
forward
and
speaking
what
the
attraction
about
this
pamela
seems
to
do
nothing
else
when
she
is
dancing
every
one
doing
it
my
dear
i
want
to
take
it
up
myself
so
as
to
reduce
my
figure
but
it
such
an
impossible
place
to
get
at
i
only
been
to
olympia
for
the
military
tournaments
but
pam
has
a
perfect
passion
for
getting
about
by
the
underground
railway
alex
is
pam
a
refreshing
person
alex
felt
uncertain
as
to
her
meaning
and
was
startled
at
being
addressed
she
knew
that
she
coloured
and
looked
confused
my
dear
said
barbara
impressively
your
nerves
must
simply
have
gone
to
pieces
imagine
jumping
like
that
when
you
spoken
to
do
you
think
she
ought
to
do
a
violet
there
a
place
in
belgrave
street
no
no
said
violet
kind
soft
voice
she
coming
to
us
you
must
let
us
have
her
barbara
for
a
good
long
visit
must
she
cedric
of
course
you
must
have
your
old
quarters
upstairs
alex
the
kindness
nearly
made
her
cry
she
felt
as
might
a
child
expecting
to
be
scolded
and
punished
and
unexpectedly
met
with
smiles
and
come
up
and
see
baby
said
violet
she
such
a
little
love
and
i
want
her
to
know
her
new
auntie
violet
we
really
must
talk
business
some
time
said
barbara
hesitating
there
are
plans
to
be
settled
you
know
what
alex
is
going
to
do
next
she
going
to
play
with
rosemary
next
do
worry
dear
we
can
talk
plans
any
time
there
really
no
hurry
alex
dimly
surmised
that
the
words
and
the
indolent
smile
accompanying
them
might
be
characteristic
of
her
new
violet
took
her
upstairs
the
nursery
is
just
the
same
we
have
changed
a
thing
she
told
her
alex
gave
a
cry
of
recognition
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
oh
the
little
gate
that
fenced
off
the
landing
it
was
put
up
when
cedric
was
a
baby
because
he
would
run
out
and
look
through
the
balusters
was
it
really
cried
violet
delightedly
cedric
did
know
that
he
told
me
that
it
had
always
been
there
i
shall
love
having
you
alex
you
be
able
to
tell
me
such
lots
of
things
about
cedric
when
he
was
a
little
boy
that
no
one
else
knows
you
see
there
so
little
difference
between
him
and
barbara
is
there
i
am
only
three
years
older
than
barbara
then
you
the
same
age
or
a
little
older
than
i
am
i
am
two
whole
years
older
than
cedric
is
it
dreadful
she
laughed
gaily
as
she
turned
the
handle
of
the
nursery
door
baby
precious
where
are
you
alex
followed
her
into
the
big
sunny
room
a
young
nurse
in
stiff
white
piqué
sat
sewing
in
the
window
and
a
starched
baby
with
disordered
sunny
curls
crawled
about
the
floor
at
her
feet
when
she
saw
her
mother
she
began
to
run
towards
her
with
outstretched
hands
and
inarticulate
coos
of
pleasure
come
along
then
and
see
your
new
auntie
violet
caught
her
up
and
lifted
her
into
her
arms
is
she
rather
a
love
alex
shall
we
look
after
her
for
a
little
while
while
nurse
goes
downstairs
alex
nodded
she
felt
as
though
she
hardly
dared
speak
for
fear
of
frightening
the
pretty
little
laughing
child
besides
the
constriction
was
tightening
in
her
throat
violet
sank
down
into
a
low
chair
with
rosemary
still
in
her
arms
i
stay
with
her
nurse
if
you
like
to
go
downstairs
for
thank
you
my
lady
sit
down
and
let
be
comfy
alex
is
this
much
nicer
than
being
downstairs
alex
looked
round
the
nursery
as
violet
had
said
it
had
not
been
altered
on
the
mantelpiece
she
suddenly
saw
the
big
white
clock
supported
by
stout
cherubs
that
had
been
there
ever
since
she
could
remember
it
was
ticking
in
a
sedate
unalterable
way
something
in
the
sight
of
the
clock
utterly
familiar
and
yet
forgotten
altogether
during
all
her
years
away
from
clevedon
square
suddenly
caught
at
alex
she
made
an
involuntary
choking
sound
and
to
her
own
dismay
sobs
suddenly
overpowered
her
my
poor
dear
said
violet
compassionately
do
cry
it
do
you
good
and
baby
and
i
wo
mind
or
ever
tell
a
soul
will
we
my
rosemary
i
knew
you
feel
much
better
when
you
had
it
out
and
nobody
will
disturb
us
here
alex
had
sunk
on
to
the
floor
and
was
leaning
her
head
against
chair
the
soft
murmuring
voice
went
on
above
her
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
in
my
life
as
barbara
bringing
you
here
today
she
never
explained
when
she
telephoned
that
you
had
been
in
england
for
goodness
knows
how
many
years
let
alone
to
this
house
and
of
course
i
thought
she
settled
it
all
with
you
till
i
saw
your
face
when
she
brought
you
into
the
all
full
of
tiresome
people
and
brothers
and
sisters
you
had
set
eyes
on
for
then
i
knew
of
course
and
i
could
have
smacked
her
you
poor
child
no
no
sobbed
alex
incoherently
it
only
just
at
first
and
coming
back
and
finding
them
all
so
changed
and
not
knowing
what
i
am
going
to
do
do
why
you
coming
here
cedric
and
rosemary
and
i
want
you
and
barbara
does
deserve
to
keep
you
after
the
way
she
begun
settle
it
all
with
her
oh
how
you
are
to
me
cried
alex
violet
bent
down
and
kissed
her
kind
why
are
i
your
sister
and
rosemary
your
one
and
only
niece
look
at
her
alex
and
see
if
she
like
any
one
cedric
sometimes
says
she
like
your
father
a
little
perhaps
but
she
very
like
you
i
think
oh
i
never
had
those
great
round
grey
eyes
those
are
cedric
and
perhaps
yours
they
the
same
colour
anyway
i
believe
she
really
very
like
what
you
must
have
been
as
a
baby
alex
it
was
evident
that
violet
was
paying
the
highest
compliment
within
her
power
alex
put
out
her
hand
timidly
to
little
rosemary
she
was
not
at
all
shy
and
seemed
accustomed
to
being
played
with
and
admired
as
she
sat
on
her
mother
lap
alex
thought
how
pretty
and
happy
she
and
violet
looked
together
she
was
emotionally
too
much
and
had
for
too
many
years
felt
herself
to
be
completely
and
for
ever
outside
the
pale
of
warm
human
happiness
to
feel
any
pang
of
envy
presently
violet
reluctantly
gave
up
rosemary
to
the
nurse
again
and
said
i
afraid
we
ought
to
go
down
i
do
like
to
leave
barbara
any
longer
she
never
comes
up
here
hardly
ever
poor
barbara
i
sometimes
think
it
because
she
has
any
babies
of
her
own
let
come
down
and
find
her
alex
they
found
barbara
in
the
library
earnestly
talking
to
cedric
who
was
leaning
back
smoking
and
looking
very
much
bored
he
sprang
up
when
they
entered
and
from
his
relieved
manner
and
from
barbara
abrupt
silence
alex
conjectured
that
they
had
been
discussing
her
own
return
she
stood
for
a
moment
forlorn
and
awkward
till
violet
sank
on
to
the
big
sofa
and
held
out
her
hand
in
invitation
to
her
give
me
a
cigarette
cedric
what
have
you
and
barbara
been
plotting
like
two
conspirators
cedric
laughed
looking
at
her
with
a
sort
of
indulgent
pride
but
barbara
said
with
determined
rapidity
it
all
very
well
violet
to
laugh
but
we
got
to
talk
business
after
all
this
unexpected
step
of
alex
has
made
a
lot
of
difference
one
thought
of
her
as
absolutely
settled
as
father
did
when
he
made
his
will
you
see
alex
cedric
told
his
sister
the
share
which
should
have
been
yours
was
divided
by
father
will
between
barbara
and
pamela
and
there
was
no
mention
of
you
except
just
for
the
fifty
pounds
a
year
which
my
father
thought
would
pay
your
actual
living
expenses
in
the
convent
he
never
thought
of
your
coming
away
again
how
could
he
after
all
these
years
ejaculated
barbara
i
know
but
i
could
have
stayed
on
cedric
indeed
i
could
i
know
i
ought
to
have
found
out
sooner
that
i
was
fitted
for
the
life
but
if
you
knew
what
it
all
been
like
her
voice
broke
huskily
and
despair
overwhelmed
her
at
the
thought
of
trying
to
explain
what
they
would
never
understand
poor
little
thing
said
violet
compassionate
voice
of
course
you
could
stay
on
they
nearly
killed
you
as
it
is
wretched
people
no
no
they
were
kind
the
point
is
alex
barbara
broke
in
that
you
only
got
the
wretched
fifty
pounds
a
year
of
course
i
be
more
than
glad
to
let
you
have
what
would
naturally
have
been
yours
but
how
on
earth
i
to
manage
it
i
do
know
cedric
can
tell
you
what
a
state
poor
ralph
left
his
affairs
in
you
never
believe
how
little
i
have
to
live
on
of
course
the
money
from
father
was
a
godsend
i
do
deny
it
but
if
cedric
thinks
it
justice
to
give
it
back
to
you
she
looked
terribly
anxious
gazing
at
her
brother
no
no
barbara
said
alex
horrified
i
do
want
the
money
of
course
you
must
keep
it
you
and
pamela
that
all
very
well
my
dear
alex
said
cedric
sensibly
but
how
do
you
propose
to
live
you
must
look
at
it
from
a
practical
point
of
view
then
you
think
broke
from
barbara
irrepressibly
no
my
dear
i
do
one
knows
very
well
as
things
are
as
poor
ralph
left
things
it
would
be
almost
out
of
the
question
to
expect
he
looked
helplessly
at
his
wife
of
course
dear
she
said
placidly
but
there
pamela
share
pamela
will
marry
of
course
she
sure
to
marry
but
until
then
or
at
least
until
she
comes
of
age
i
do
think
as
her
guardian
cedric
broke
off
looking
much
harassed
if
pam
married
a
rich
man
which
she
probably
will
said
violet
with
a
low
laugh
we
ca
take
distant
possibilities
into
consideration
barbara
interposed
sharply
we
dealing
with
actual
facts
alex
looked
from
one
to
the
other
with
bewilderment
she
hardly
understood
what
they
were
all
discussing
from
the
natural
home
of
her
childhood
and
girlhood
where
she
had
lived
as
unthinking
of
ways
and
means
as
every
other
girl
of
her
class
and
generation
she
had
passed
into
the
convent
world
where
all
was
communal
and
the
rights
of
the
individual
a
thing
part
shunned
part
unknown
she
could
not
at
first
grasp
that
cedric
and
barbara
and
violet
perhaps
pam
and
archie
too
were
all
wondering
how
she
would
be
able
to
maintain
herself
on
fifty
pounds
a
year
of
course
barbara
was
saying
alex
could
come
to
me
for
a
bit
love
to
have
you
dear
but
you
saw
for
yourself
what
a
tiny
place
mine
is
and
there
only
ada
i
do
quite
know
what
she
say
to
having
two
people
instead
of
one
i
must
say
we
want
her
too
violet
exclaimed
caressingly
let
us
have
her
for
a
little
while
barbara
while
you
preparing
ada
mind
for
the
shock
she
broke
into
her
low
gurgling
laugh
again
barbara
looked
infinitely
relieved
what
do
you
think
alex
it
is
that
i
would
love
to
have
you
but
there
no
denying
that
ways
and
means
count
and
in
a
tiny
household
like
mine
every
item
adds
up
oh
said
alex
desperately
i
know
what
you
must
feel
the
difficulty
of
of
knowing
what
to
do
with
me
it
always
been
like
that
ever
since
i
was
a
little
girl
i
made
a
failure
of
everything
do
you
remember
barbara
must
old
nurse
saying
will
never
stick
to
anything
and
i
never
have
i
never
shall
i
can
only
make
dreadful
muddles
and
failures
and
upset
you
all
if
only
one
could
wreck
own
life
without
interfering
with
other
people
there
was
a
silence
which
alex
after
her
outburst
knew
very
well
was
not
one
of
comprehension
then
cedric
said
gently
you
must
let
yourself
exaggerate
my
dear
we
very
glad
to
have
you
with
us
again
one
only
ca
help
wishing
it
had
been
rather
sooner
but
there
no
use
in
crying
over
spilt
milk
and
after
all
as
violet
says
there
no
hurry
about
anything
come
to
us
and
have
a
good
long
rest
you
look
as
though
you
needed
it
and
get
a
little
flesh
on
your
bones
again
we
can
settle
all
the
rest
afterwards
alex
saw
barbara
looking
at
her
with
furtive
eagerness
she
turned
to
her
with
the
utter
dependence
on
another
judgment
that
had
become
second
nature
to
her
when
shall
i
go
my
dear
protested
barbara
of
course
the
longer
you
can
stay
with
me
the
better
i
shall
be
pleased
it
only
that
ada
she
broke
off
at
the
sound
of
violet
irrepressible
laugh
you
must
suit
yourself
absolutely
of
course
supposing
you
came
to
us
at
the
end
of
the
week
violet
suggested
say
saturday
pamela
is
going
away
then
to
pay
one
or
two
visits
and
i
shall
have
you
all
to
myself
alex
looked
at
her
wonderingly
it
seemed
to
her
incredible
that
violet
should
actually
want
her
so
engrained
was
her
sense
of
her
own
isolation
of
spirit
that
terrible
isolation
of
those
who
have
definitely
and
for
long
past
lost
all
and
which
can
never
be
realized
or
penetrated
by
those
outside
that
will
be
delightful
said
violet
seeming
to
take
her
acceptance
for
granted
barbara
got
up
smoothing
her
skirt
gently
we
really
ought
to
be
going
alex
i
said
we
be
in
to
tea
and
it
takes
such
ages
to
get
back
alex
rose
submissively
she
marvelled
at
the
assurance
of
barbara
even
at
the
ease
of
her
conventionally
affectionate
farewells
well
my
dear
when
are
you
coming
out
to
the
wilds
to
look
me
up
then
without
giving
her
time
to
reply
she
added
gaily
you
must
ring
me
up
and
let
me
know
when
you
a
spare
moment
you
know
i
always
a
fixture
what
a
blessing
the
telephone
is
then
we
see
you
on
saturday
alex
said
her
brother
good
take
care
of
yourself
my
dear
he
looked
after
her
with
an
expression
of
concern
as
the
servant
held
open
the
door
for
her
and
barbara
and
they
went
into
the
street
alex
could
not
believe
that
this
kindly
rather
pompous
man
was
her
younger
brother
cedric
has
grown
very
but
i
did
expect
to
see
him
so
so
somehow
she
said
barbara
laughed
time
has
stood
still
with
any
of
us
you
know
think
violet
looks
older
than
he
does
she
is
of
course
she
be
a
mountain
in
a
few
years
time
if
she
does
take
care
oh
barbara
i
think
she
so
pretty
and
sweet
barbara
shrugged
her
shoulders
very
slightly
she
and
i
have
never
made
particularly
violent
friends
though
i
like
her
of
course
pamela
adores
her
and
i
must
say
she
been
good
to
pam
but
her
kindness
does
cost
her
anything
she
always
been
rich
and
had
everything
she
wanted
she
was
the
only
girl
and
her
people
adored
her
and
now
cedric
lets
her
do
everything
she
likes
she
spends
any
amount
of
money
look
at
her
clothes
and
the
way
she
has
little
rosemary
always
dressed
in
white
rosemary
is
lovely
it
so
extraordinary
to
think
of
cedric
child
barbara
tightened
her
lips
she
ought
to
have
been
a
boy
of
course
cedric
pretended
not
to
care
but
it
must
have
been
a
disappointment
and
goodness
only
knows
if
violet
will
ever
she
stopped
throwing
a
quick
glance
out
of
the
corners
of
her
eyes
at
her
sister
alex
wondered
why
she
did
not
finish
her
sentence
and
what
she
had
been
about
to
say
the
constraint
in
her
intercourse
with
barbara
was
becoming
more
and
more
evident
to
her
perceptions
it
was
clear
that
her
sister
did
not
intend
to
ask
any
questions
as
to
the
crisis
through
which
alex
had
passed
and
when
she
had
once
ascertained
that
alex
had
not
seen
anybody
whilst
in
rome
she
did
not
refer
to
that
either
alex
wondered
if
barbara
would
tell
her
anything
of
ralph
and
their
married
life
but
the
reserve
which
had
always
been
characteristic
of
barbara
since
her
nursery
days
had
hardened
sensibly
and
it
was
obvious
that
she
wished
neither
to
give
nor
to
receive
confidences
she
was
quite
ready
however
to
discuss
her
brother
cedric
and
his
wife
or
the
prospects
of
pamela
and
archie
and
alex
listened
all
the
evening
to
barbara
incisive
little
clear
tones
delivering
shrewd
comments
and
judgments
she
again
suggested
that
alex
should
go
to
bed
early
saying
as
she
kissed
her
it
quite
delightful
to
have
some
one
to
talk
to
for
me
i
generally
read
or
sew
all
the
evening
it
must
be
lonely
for
you
barbara
oh
i
do
mind
quiet
she
laughed
as
though
edging
away
from
any
hint
of
emotional
topic
but
of
course
it
nice
to
have
some
one
for
a
change
she
turned
towards
the
door
of
the
bedroom
oh
alex
there
just
one
thing
i
know
you
rather
i
said
it
if
you
would
mind
sometime
any
time
you
think
of
it
just
letting
me
have
the
money
for
those
clothes
we
bought
for
you
today
the
bills
have
come
in
i
asked
for
them
as
i
do
have
an
account
i
knew
you
rather
be
reminded
knowing
what
pauper
i
am
i
only
wish
i
had
got
to
worry
you
my
dear
sleep
well
xxv
violet
for
days
and
nights
to
come
the
question
of
the
money
that
barbara
had
paid
for
her
clothes
weighed
upon
alex
she
had
no
idea
how
she
was
to
repay
her
the
money
that
had
been
given
her
in
rome
for
her
journey
to
england
had
only
lasted
her
to
charing
cross
and
even
her
cab
fare
to
hampstead
had
been
supplemented
by
barbara
alex
remembered
it
with
fresh
dismay
even
when
she
had
left
downshire
hill
and
was
in
clevedon
square
again
the
thought
lashed
her
with
a
secret
terror
until
one
day
she
said
to
cedric
what
ought
i
to
do
cedric
to
get
my
fifty
pounds
a
year
who
do
i
get
it
from
do
pumphrey
and
scott
send
it
half
yearly
i
thought
that
was
the
arrangement
you
gave
them
your
change
of
address
i
suppose
oh
no
said
alex
gently
i
never
written
to
them
except
once
just
after
father
died
to
ask
them
to
make
the
cheques
payable
to
to
the
superior
what
on
earth
made
you
do
that
they
thought
it
was
best
you
see
i
had
no
banking
account
so
the
money
was
paid
into
the
community
account
i
see
cedric
remarked
drily
well
the
sooner
you
write
and
revoke
that
arrangement
the
better
when
did
they
last
send
you
a
cheque
in
june
i
do
know
alex
was
forced
to
say
feeling
all
the
time
that
cedric
must
be
thinking
her
a
helpless
unpractical
fool
write
and
find
out
and
meanwhile
i
say
alex
have
you
enough
to
go
on
with
i
i
have
any
money
cedric
in
rome
they
gave
me
enough
for
my
travelling
expenses
but
nothing
is
left
of
that
but
what
have
you
done
all
this
time
i
suppose
you
wanted
clothes
and
things
i
got
some
with
barbara
but
they
are
paid
for
and
there
are
some
other
things
i
need
you
see
i
have
got
anything
at
all
not
even
stamps
said
alex
forlornly
violet
said
something
about
taking
me
to
some
shops
with
her
but
i
suppose
all
her
places
are
very
expensive
they
are
dashed
expensive
cedric
admitted
with
a
short
laugh
but
look
here
alex
will
you
let
me
advance
you
what
you
want
it
be
helped
of
course
but
the
whole
arrangement
comes
rather
hard
on
you
as
things
are
now
you
see
poor
barbara
is
really
as
badly
off
as
she
can
be
ralph
was
a
most
awful
ass
between
ourselves
and
muddled
away
the
little
he
had
and
she
gets
pretty
nearly
nothing
except
a
widow
pension
which
was
very
small
and
the
money
father
left
if
you
believe
me
ralph
did
even
insure
his
life
before
going
to
south
africa
of
course
he
did
go
to
fight
but
on
the
staff
of
one
of
the
big
papers
and
it
was
supposed
to
be
a
very
good
thing
and
then
what
did
he
do
but
go
and
get
dysentery
before
he
been
there
a
fortnight
cedric
voice
held
all
the
pitying
scorn
of
the
successful
poor
barbara
said
alex
that
just
what
she
is
of
course
i
think
myself
that
pamela
will
make
your
share
over
to
you
again
when
she
marries
not
likely
to
make
a
rotten
bad
match
like
barbara
far
from
it
but
until
then
she
ca
do
anything
you
know
at
least
not
until
she
of
age
if
then
cedric
stopped
and
his
right
hand
tapped
with
his
spectacles
on
his
left
hand
in
the
little
characteristic
trick
that
was
so
like
sir
francis
alex
had
already
heard
him
make
much
the
same
observations
but
she
realized
that
cedric
had
retained
all
his
old
knack
of
reiteration
i
see
she
said
well
my
dear
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
is
that
you
must
let
me
be
your
banker
for
the
time
being
and
and
alex
said
cedric
with
a
most
unwonted
touch
of
embarrassment
breaking
into
his
kind
assured
manner
you
need
mind
taking
it
there
there
plenty
of
money
here
there
is
really
alex
realized
afterwards
that
it
would
hardly
have
occurred
to
her
to
taking
the
twenty
pounds
which
cedric
offered
her
with
such
patent
diffidence
she
had
never
known
the
want
of
money
either
in
her
clevedon
square
days
or
during
her
ten
years
of
convent
life
she
did
not
realize
its
value
in
the
eyes
of
other
people
the
isolation
of
her
point
of
view
on
this
and
other
kindred
subjects
gradually
became
evident
to
her
her
scale
of
relative
values
had
remained
that
which
had
been
set
before
her
in
the
early
days
of
her
novitiate
that
held
by
her
present
surroundings
differed
from
it
in
almost
every
particular
and
more
especially
in
degree
of
concentration
all
violet
warm
healthy
affection
for
rosemary
did
not
prevent
her
intense
preoccupation
with
her
own
clothes
and
her
own
jewels
or
her
conviction
that
no
one
was
ever
in
london
during
the
month
of
august
and
that
to
be
so
would
constitute
a
calamity
all
cedric
pride
in
his
wife
and
love
for
her
in
no
way
lessened
his
manifest
satisfaction
at
his
own
success
in
life
and
at
the
renovated
fortunes
of
the
house
of
clare
both
he
and
violet
found
their
recreation
in
playing
bridge
cedric
at
his
club
and
violet
in
her
own
house
or
at
the
houses
of
what
seemed
to
alex
an
infinite
succession
of
friends
with
all
of
whom
she
seemed
to
be
on
exactly
the
same
terms
of
an
unintimate
affection
violet
at
night
when
she
dismissed
her
maid
and
begged
alex
to
stay
and
talk
to
her
until
cedric
came
upstairs
which
he
never
did
until
past
twelve
was
adorable
she
listened
to
alex
incoherent
nervous
outpourings
which
alex
herself
knew
to
be
vain
and
futile
from
the
very
longing
which
possessed
her
to
make
herself
clear
and
said
no
word
of
condemnation
or
of
questioning
at
first
the
gentle
pressure
of
violet
soft
hand
on
her
hair
and
her
low
sympathetic
murmuring
voice
soothed
alex
to
a
sort
of
tearful
gratitude
in
which
she
would
nightly
cry
herself
to
sleep
it
was
only
as
she
grew
slowly
physically
stronger
that
the
craving
for
which
had
tormented
her
all
her
life
woke
again
did
violet
understand
she
would
reiterate
her
explanations
and
dissections
of
her
own
past
misery
with
a
growing
consciousness
of
morbidity
and
a
positive
terror
lest
violet
should
at
last
repulse
however
gently
the
endless
demand
for
an
understanding
that
alex
herself
perpetually
declared
to
be
impossible
it
now
seemed
to
her
that
nothing
mattered
so
long
as
violet
understood
and
by
that
understanding
restored
to
alex
in
some
degree
her
utterly
shattered
and
this
dependence
grew
the
more
intense
as
she
became
more
aware
how
unstable
was
her
foothold
in
the
world
of
normal
life
with
the
consciousness
of
an
enormous
and
grotesque
mistake
behind
her
mingled
all
the
convent
tradition
of
sin
and
disgrace
attached
to
broken
vows
and
the
return
to
an
abjured
world
one
night
she
said
to
violet
i
did
do
anything
in
entering
the
convent
it
was
a
mistake
and
i
bearing
the
consequence
of
the
mistake
but
it
seems
to
me
that
people
find
it
much
easier
to
overlook
a
sin
than
a
mistake
well
i
rather
ask
a
to
lunch
than
a
woman
who
ate
peas
off
her
knife
violet
admitted
candidly
that
what
i
mean
there
really
no
place
for
people
who
made
bad
mistakes
anywhere
if
you
mean
yourself
alex
dear
you
know
there
always
a
place
for
you
here
just
as
long
as
you
happy
with
us
only
i
sometimes
afraid
that
it
not
quite
the
sort
of
life
after
all
you
been
through
you
poor
dear
i
know
people
do
come
in
and
out
a
good
deal
and
it
will
be
worse
than
ever
when
pam
is
at
home
violet
you
very
good
to
me
you
the
only
person
who
has
seemed
at
all
to
understand
my
dear
i
do
understand
really
i
think
i
do
it
just
as
you
say
you
made
a
mistake
when
you
were
very
young
too
young
to
be
allowed
to
take
such
a
step
in
my
opinion
and
you
suffering
the
most
bitter
consequences
but
no
one
in
their
senses
could
blame
you
either
for
going
into
that
wretched
place
or
still
less
for
coming
out
of
it
one
is
always
blamed
by
some
one
i
think
for
every
mistake
people
would
rather
forgive
one
for
murder
than
for
making
a
fool
of
oneself
forgiveness
said
violet
thoughtfully
it
rather
an
overrated
virtue
in
my
opinion
i
do
think
it
ought
to
be
very
hard
to
forgive
any
one
one
loved
anything
would
forgive
anything
violet
i
think
so
said
violet
looking
rather
surprised
unless
i
were
deliberately
deceived
by
some
one
whom
i
trusted
that
different
of
course
one
might
perhaps
forgive
even
then
in
a
way
but
it
would
be
the
same
thing
again
ever
no
said
alex
no
of
course
not
every
one
feels
the
same
about
deceit
in
the
depths
of
her
own
consciousness
alex
was
groping
dimly
after
some
other
standard
some
elusive
certainty
that
continually
evaded
her
were
not
those
things
which
were
hardest
to
forgive
the
most
in
need
of
forgiveness
alex
with
the
engrained
in
the
unstable
wondered
if
that
question
were
not
born
of
the
fundamental
weakness
in
her
own
character
which
had
led
her
all
her
life
to
evade
or
pervert
the
truth
in
a
passionate
fear
lest
it
should
alienate
from
her
the
love
and
confidence
that
she
craved
for
from
others
sometimes
she
thought
violet
will
find
me
out
and
then
she
will
stop
being
fond
of
me
and
knowing
that
her
claim
on
violet
compassion
was
the
strongest
link
that
she
could
forge
between
them
she
would
dilate
upon
the
mental
and
physical
misery
of
the
last
two
years
telling
herself
all
the
time
that
she
was
trading
on
her
sister
pity
her
days
in
clevedon
square
were
singularly
empty
after
violet
had
tried
the
experiment
of
taking
alex
about
with
her
to
the
houses
of
one
or
two
old
friends
and
alex
had
come
back
trembling
and
nearly
crying
and
begging
never
to
go
again
her
nerves
were
still
utterly
undependable
and
her
health
had
suffered
no
less
than
her
appearance
violet
would
have
taken
her
to
see
a
doctor
but
alex
dreaded
the
questions
that
he
would
of
necessity
put
to
her
and
cedric
who
distrusted
inherently
the
practice
of
any
science
of
which
he
himself
knew
nothing
declared
that
rest
and
good
food
would
be
her
best
physicians
sometimes
she
went
to
see
barbara
at
hampstead
but
seldom
willingly
one
of
her
visits
there
was
the
occasion
for
a
stupid
childish
lie
of
which
the
remembrance
made
her
miserable
alex
amongst
other
unpractical
disabilities
was
as
entirely
devoid
as
it
is
possible
to
be
of
any
sense
of
direction
she
had
never
known
how
to
find
her
way
about
and
would
turn
as
blindly
and
instinctively
in
the
wrong
direction
as
a
dartmoor
pony
turns
tail
to
the
wind
for
ten
years
she
had
never
been
outside
the
walls
of
the
convent
alone
and
when
she
had
lived
in
london
as
a
girl
she
could
not
remember
ever
having
been
by
herself
violet
always
driven
everywhere
in
her
own
motor
and
accustomed
to
pamela
modern
resourcefulness
and
independence
never
took
so
childish
an
inability
into
serious
consideration
alex
dear
barbara
hoped
you
go
down
to
her
this
afternoon
will
you
do
that
or
come
to
ranelagh
the
only
thing
is
if
you
would
mind
going
to
hampstead
in
a
taxi
i
shall
have
to
use
the
mercédès
and
the
little
car
is
being
cleaned
of
course
i
should
mind
i
go
to
barbara
i
think
just
whichever
you
like
best
and
you
be
back
early
wo
you
because
we
dining
at
seven
and
you
know
how
ridiculous
cedric
is
about
punctuality
and
the
servants
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
after
violet
had
gone
in
all
her
soft
elaborate
laces
and
hat
alex
with
every
instinct
of
her
convent
training
set
against
the
extravagance
of
a
taxi
started
out
on
foot
rejoicing
that
a
sunny
july
day
should
give
her
the
opportunity
of
enjoying
pamela
boasted
delight
the
top
of
an
omnibus
she
took
the
wrong
one
discovered
her
mistake
too
late
and
spent
most
of
the
afternoon
in
bewilderedly
retracing
her
own
footsteps
finally
she
found
a
taxi
and
arrived
at
downshire
hill
very
tired
and
after
five
barbara
was
shocked
as
alex
had
known
she
would
be
at
the
taxi
violet
is
so
inconsiderate
because
she
can
afford
taxis
as
a
matter
of
course
herself
she
never
thinks
that
other
people
ca
i
know
myself
how
every
shilling
mounts
up
i
see
you
into
an
omnibus
when
you
go
alex
it
takes
just
under
an
hour
and
you
need
only
change
once
but
that
change
took
place
at
the
junction
of
four
roads
all
of
them
seething
with
traffic
and
again
alex
was
hopelessly
at
sea
and
boarded
at
last
an
omnibus
that
conveyed
her
swiftly
in
the
wrong
direction
she
was
late
for
dinner
and
when
cedric
inquired
with
his
assumption
of
the
householder
whose
domestic
routine
has
been
flung
out
of
gear
what
had
delayed
her
she
stammered
and
said
that
barbara
had
kept
her
she
had
let
her
start
early
enough
had
mistaken
the
time
it
was
just
such
a
lie
as
a
child
might
have
told
in
the
fear
of
ridicule
or
blame
and
she
told
it
badly
as
a
child
might
have
told
it
stammering
with
a
frightened
widening
of
her
eyes
so
that
even
violet
looked
momentarily
puzzled
alex
despised
and
hated
herself
she
knew
vaguely
that
her
sense
of
proportion
was
disorganized
she
was
a
woman
of
and
her
faults
her
judgments
and
appreciations
even
her
mistakes
were
those
of
an
unbalanced
child
of
morbid
tendencies
when
pamela
came
back
to
clevedon
square
alex
was
first
of
all
afraid
of
her
and
then
became
jealous
of
her
she
was
jealous
of
pam
of
her
enormous
security
in
her
own
popularity
and
success
jealous
even
of
the
innumerable
common
interests
and
the
mutual
love
of
enjoyment
that
bound
her
and
violet
together
she
was
miserably
ashamed
of
her
feelings
and
sought
to
conceal
them
none
the
less
as
she
became
aware
of
a
certain
shrewdness
of
judgment
underlying
all
pamela
breezy
vitality
and
de
she
and
her
sister
had
nothing
in
common
to
pamela
alex
evidently
appeared
far
removed
from
herself
as
a
being
of
another
generation
less
of
a
contemporary
than
pretty
violet
or
than
little
rosemary
in
her
joyous
healthy
play
pamela
could
accompany
violet
everywhere
always
radiantly
enjoying
herself
and
receiving
endless
congratulations
thinly
disguised
as
raillery
on
her
universal
popularity
and
the
charm
that
she
seemed
to
radiate
at
will
she
could
play
with
rosemary
thoroughly
enjoying
a
romp
for
its
own
sake
and
making
even
cedric
laugh
at
her
complete
do
you
like
children
pamela
asked
alex
looking
up
from
the
nursery
floor
where
she
was
playing
with
her
niece
yes
i
like
them
said
alex
sombrely
she
had
been
reflecting
bitterly
that
she
would
have
known
how
to
play
with
a
baby
of
her
own
but
with
pamela
and
the
nurse
in
the
room
she
was
afraid
of
picking
up
rosemary
and
making
a
fuss
with
her
as
pam
was
doing
afraid
with
the
terrible
insecurity
of
the
and
she
never
would
have
babies
of
her
own
now
the
thought
had
tormented
her
often
of
late
watching
violet
with
her
child
and
pamela
with
her
own
future
that
would
hold
home
and
happiness
as
her
rights
but
alex
concealed
her
thoughts
even
as
far
as
possible
from
herself
the
married
woman
who
is
denied
children
may
lament
her
deprivation
and
receive
compassion
but
the
spinster
whose
lot
forbids
her
the
hope
must
either
conceal
her
regrets
or
know
herself
to
be
accounted
morbid
and
indelicate
i
like
babies
while
they
small
pam
remarked
do
i
you
little
horror
of
a
niece
other
people
you
know
i
do
know
that
i
should
want
any
of
my
own
they
all
very
well
when
they
tiny
but
i
bear
them
at
the
stage
i
make
it
a
rule
never
to
tell
the
children
stories
at
the
houses
where
i
stay
i
always
say
the
very
first
evening
that
i
do
know
any
then
they
know
what
to
expect
some
girls
let
themselves
be
regularly
victimized
if
they
want
to
please
the
children
mother
and
get
asked
again
i
must
say
i
do
hate
that
sort
of
thing
myself
and
i
do
believe
it
really
does
any
good
men
are
generally
frightfully
bored
by
the
sort
of
girl
who
wonderful
with
children
they
much
rather
have
one
who
can
play
tennis
or
who
good
at
bridge
pamela
laughed
comfortably
at
her
own
cynicism
i
must
say
i
do
think
it
pays
one
to
be
honest
in
the
long
run
i
always
say
exactly
what
i
feel
myself
and
do
care
what
any
one
thinks
of
me
alex
felt
a
dull
anger
at
her
sister
statement
of
what
she
knew
to
be
the
truth
pamela
could
afford
to
be
frank
and
her
boast
seemed
to
alex
to
cast
an
oblique
reflection
on
herself
she
gazed
at
her
without
speaking
wretchedly
conscious
of
her
own
unreason
look
at
aunt
alex
baby
mischievously
exclaimed
pam
in
a
loud
whisper
we
rather
afraid
of
her
when
she
pulls
a
long
face
like
that
are
we
have
we
been
naughty
do
you
think
alex
tried
to
laugh
contorting
her
lips
stiffly
pamela
jumped
up
from
the
floor
really
and
truly
you
know
alex
she
gravely
told
her
sister
you
ought
to
try
and
make
things
less
grand
i
think
you
be
much
happier
if
you
only
cultivate
a
sense
of
humour
we
all
think
so
then
she
ran
out
of
the
room
alex
sat
still
so
they
all
thought
that
she
ought
to
cultivate
a
sense
of
humour
she
felt
herself
to
be
ridiculous
in
their
eyes
with
her
eternal
air
of
tragedy
her
sombre
despair
in
the
midst
of
their
gay
conventions
that
admitted
of
everything
except
of
weighty
unseasonable
gloom
pamela
spontaneous
and
unwearied
high
spirits
seemed
to
her
to
throw
her
own
dejection
into
greater
relief
her
own
utter
social
incompetence
she
began
to
long
for
the
end
of
july
when
the
household
in
clevedon
square
would
be
dispersed
for
the
remainder
of
the
summer
pamela
talked
incessantly
of
a
yachting
invitation
which
she
had
received
for
august
and
spoke
of
the
difficulty
of
sandwiching
in
visits
for
autumn
and
alex
knew
that
violet
people
were
taking
a
house
in
scotland
and
wanted
her
and
cedric
and
the
baby
to
make
it
their
headquarters
she
wondered
with
a
sense
of
impending
crisis
what
would
happen
to
her
at
last
cedric
said
to
her
have
you
any
particular
plans
for
august
alex
i
want
to
get
violet
up
north
as
soon
as
possible
she
done
so
much
rushing
about
lately
i
wish
you
could
come
with
us
my
dear
but
we
going
to
the
temples
that
the
worst
of
not
having
a
place
of
one
own
in
the
country
oh
said
alex
faintly
do
bother
about
me
cedric
i
shall
find
somewhere
he
looked
dissatisfied
but
said
only
well
you
talk
it
over
with
violet
i
know
she
been
vexed
at
seeing
so
little
of
you
lately
but
pamela
an
exacting
young
woman
and
chaperoning
her
is
no
joke
i
wish
she
hurry
up
and
get
settled
all
this
rushing
about
is
too
much
for
violet
i
thought
she
liked
it
so
she
does
anyhow
said
cedric
with
an
odd
shy
laugh
she
like
anything
that
pleased
somebody
else
she
made
like
that
i
never
known
her
anything
but
happy
like
sunshine
then
he
flung
a
cigarette
into
the
fireplace
looked
awkward
at
his
own
unusual
expression
of
feeling
and
abruptly
asked
alex
if
she
seen
the
newspaper
alex
crept
away
wondering
why
happiness
should
be
accounted
a
virtue
she
loved
violet
with
a
jealous
exclusive
affection
and
admiration
but
she
thought
enviously
that
she
too
could
have
been
like
sunshine
if
she
had
received
all
that
violet
received
she
too
would
have
liked
to
be
always
happy
she
had
her
talk
with
violet
there
was
the
slightest
shade
of
wistfulness
in
violet
gentleness
i
wish
we
made
you
happier
but
i
really
believe
quiet
is
what
you
want
most
and
things
are
ever
very
quiet
here
especially
with
pam
i
simply
love
having
her
but
i
not
sure
she
is
the
best
person
for
you
just
now
i
do
feel
i
know
her
very
well
i
mean
i
not
at
all
at
home
with
her
she
makes
me
realize
what
a
stranger
i
am
to
the
younger
ones
after
all
these
years
poor
alex
you
much
more
like
my
sister
than
she
is
and
yet
a
year
ago
i
did
know
you
alex
dear
i
so
glad
if
i
a
comfort
to
you
but
i
wish
you
would
speak
in
that
bitter
way
about
poor
little
pamela
it
seems
so
unnatural
violet
whole
healthy
instinct
was
always
alex
had
already
discovered
to
tend
towards
the
normal
the
outlook
of
sanity
she
was
instinctively
distressed
by
abnormality
of
any
kind
i
did
really
mean
it
said
alex
hurriedly
with
the
old
fatal
instinct
of
propitiation
and
read
dissent
into
the
silence
that
received
her
announcement
it
was
the
subconscious
hope
of
rectifying
herself
in
violet
eyes
that
made
her
add
a
moment
later
could
barbara
have
me
for
a
little
while
when
you
go
up
to
scotland
i
think
she
would
be
quite
glad
of
course
she
would
she
often
lonely
is
she
and
you
think
be
happy
with
her
oh
yes
said
alex
eagerly
bent
on
showing
violet
that
she
had
no
unnatural
aversion
from
being
with
her
own
sister
but
violet
still
looked
rather
troubled
you
remember
that
you
found
it
rather
difficult
there
when
you
first
got
back
you
said
then
that
barbara
and
you
had
never
understood
one
another
even
as
children
oh
but
that
will
all
be
different
now
said
alex
confused
and
knowing
that
her
manner
was
giving
an
impression
of
shiftiness
from
her
very
consciousness
that
she
was
contradicting
herself
as
pamela
claims
and
her
own
ceaseless
fear
of
inadequacy
made
her
increasingly
unsure
of
violet
alex
became
less
and
less
at
ease
with
her
the
old
familiar
fear
of
being
disbelieved
gave
uncertainty
to
every
word
she
uttered
and
she
could
not
afford
to
laugh
at
pam
merciless
amusement
in
pointing
out
the
number
of
times
that
she
contradicted
herself
violet
always
hushed
pamela
but
she
looked
puzzled
and
rather
distressed
and
her
manner
towards
alex
was
more
compassionate
than
ever
alex
with
the
impetuous
unwisdom
of
the
weak
one
day
forced
an
issue
violet
do
you
trust
me
my
dear
child
what
you
mean
why
should
i
trust
you
are
you
thinking
of
stealing
my
pearls
but
alex
could
not
smile
do
you
believe
everything
that
i
say
violet
looked
at
her
and
asked
very
gently
what
makes
you
ask
alex
you
not
unhappy
about
the
nonsense
that
child
pamela
sometimes
talks
are
you
no
not
exactly
it
it
just
everything
alex
looked
miserable
oh
alex
do
try
and
take
things
more
lightly
you
make
yourself
so
unhappy
poor
child
with
all
this
ca
you
take
things
as
they
come
more
the
counsel
found
unavailing
echo
in
alex
own
mind
she
knew
that
her
mental
outlook
was
wrenched
out
of
all
gear
and
she
knew
also
in
some
dim
undefined
way
that
a
physical
frame
was
responsible
for
much
of
her
torment
of
mind
sometimes
she
wondered
whether
the
impending
solution
to
her
whole
destiny
still
hanging
over
her
would
find
her
on
the
far
side
of
the
abyss
which
separates
the
normal
from
the
insane
the
days
slipped
by
and
then
just
before
the
general
dispersal
pamela
suddenly
announced
her
engagement
to
lord
richard
gunvale
the
youngest
and
by
far
the
wealthiest
of
her
many
suitors
oh
pam
pam
cried
violet
laughing
why
could
you
wait
till
after
we
left
town
but
every
one
was
delighted
and
congratulations
and
letters
and
presents
and
telegrams
poured
in
pamela
declared
that
she
would
not
be
married
until
the
winter
and
refused
to
break
her
yachting
engagement
she
was
more
popular
than
ever
now
and
every
one
laughed
at
her
delightful
originality
and
gazed
at
the
magnificence
of
the
emerald
and
diamond
ring
on
her
left
hand
and
alex
began
to
hope
faintly
that
perhaps
when
pamela
was
married
things
might
be
different
at
clevedon
square
then
one
night
just
before
she
was
to
go
to
hampstead
she
overheard
a
conversation
between
cedric
and
his
wife
she
was
on
the
stairs
in
the
dark
and
they
were
in
the
lighted
hall
below
and
from
the
first
instant
that
cedric
spoke
alex
lost
all
sense
of
what
she
was
doing
and
listened
they
wearing
you
out
pam
and
alex
between
them
i
wo
have
any
more
of
it
i
tell
you
no
no
my
dear
old
goose
of
course
they
not
violet
soft
laughter
came
up
to
alex
ears
with
a
muffled
sound
as
though
her
head
were
resting
against
cedric
shoulder
anyhow
it
is
pam
about
her
of
course
only
alex
i
wish
she
was
happier
and
why
is
she
you
a
perfect
angel
to
her
said
cedric
resentfully
i
so
for
her
only
it
difficult
sometimes
a
feeling
like
shifting
sands
one
does
know
what
to
be
with
her
if
only
she
said
what
she
wanted
or
did
want
right
out
but
it
that
awful
anxiety
to
please
poor
darling
she
always
was
like
that
from
our
nursery
days
you
never
could
get
the
rights
of
a
matter
out
of
her
plain
black
or
white
she
say
one
thing
one
day
and
another
the
next
always
that
what
i
find
so
difficult
it
impossible
to
do
anything
for
a
person
like
that
it
the
one
thing
i
understand
pack
her
off
to
hampstead
tomorrow
cedric
observed
gruffly
i
not
have
you
bothered
oh
cedric
i
not
bothered
how
can
you
she
be
going
next
week
anyway
poor
dear
and
it
may
be
easier
for
her
to
be
herself
with
barbara
who
her
own
sister
after
all
but
i
do
know
what
about
afterwards
when
we
get
back
you
have
quite
enough
to
think
about
with
pam
wedding
without
alex
on
your
hands
as
well
violet
said
cedric
with
a
note
in
his
voice
that
alex
had
never
heard
there
when
i
think
of
the
way
behaved
to
all
my
wretched
family
alex
did
not
hear
violet
answer
which
was
very
softly
spoken
she
had
turned
and
gone
away
upstairs
in
the
dark
xxvi
august
was
it
after
all
only
for
cedric
sake
that
violet
had
kept
her
at
clevedon
square
had
shown
her
such
heavenly
kindness
and
gentleness
alex
asked
herself
the
question
all
night
long
in
utter
misery
of
spirit
she
had
craved
all
her
life
for
an
exclusive
personal
affection
and
had
been
mocked
with
counterfeit
again
and
again
she
knew
now
that
it
was
only
in
despair
at
such
cheating
of
fate
that
she
had
flung
herself
rashly
to
the
opposite
end
of
the
scale
and
sought
to
embrace
a
life
that
purported
detachment
from
all
earthly
ties
will
have
all
or
had
been
the
inward
cry
of
her
bruised
spirit
fate
had
taken
her
at
her
word
this
time
and
she
had
not
been
strong
enough
to
endure
and
had
fled
cowering
from
the
consequence
of
her
own
act
tortured
distraught
with
shattered
to
the
earth
she
had
turned
once
again
with
hands
that
trembled
as
they
pleaded
to
ask
comfort
of
human
love
and
companionship
violet
had
not
condemned
her
had
pitied
her
and
had
shown
her
untiring
sympathy
and
affection
for
love
of
cedric
alex
rose
haggard
in
the
morning
she
wanted
to
be
alone
the
thought
of
going
to
barbara
in
hampstead
had
become
unendurable
to
her
it
was
with
a
curious
sense
of
inevitability
that
she
found
a
letter
from
barbara
asking
her
if
she
could
put
off
her
visit
for
the
present
the
admirable
ada
had
developed
measles
good
lord
ca
they
send
her
to
a
hospital
exclaimed
cedric
with
the
irritability
of
a
practical
man
who
finds
his
and
practical
plans
thrown
out
of
gear
by
some
eminently
unpractical
intervention
on
the
part
of
providence
i
sure
barbara
never
would
said
violet
laughing
poor
dear
i
hope
she
wo
catch
it
herself
it
mean
having
the
house
disinfected
too
what
a
nuisance
for
her
but
alex
dear
you
must
come
with
us
i
send
a
wire
today
mother
will
be
perfectly
delighted
could
i
stay
here
asked
alex
cedric
explained
that
the
house
would
be
partially
shut
up
with
only
two
of
the
servants
left
i
should
give
any
trouble
i
so
much
rather
alex
urged
unusually
persistent
my
dear
it
out
of
the
question
not
a
soul
in
london
you
forget
it
august
but
cedric
said
violet
i
do
see
why
she
should
do
as
she
likes
it
will
be
only
till
barbara
can
have
her
after
all
i
suppose
ada
will
be
moved
as
soon
as
she
better
and
the
disinfecting
take
so
very
long
if
she
wants
to
stay
here
i
do
said
alex
with
sudden
boldness
you
do
think
you
be
lonely
no
no
after
all
violet
considered
it
will
be
very
good
for
ellen
and
the
tweeny
to
have
somebody
to
wait
upon
i
never
do
like
leaving
them
here
on
enormous
board
wages
to
do
nothing
at
all
though
cedric
think
it
the
proper
thing
to
do
because
his
father
did
it
she
laughed
and
cedric
said
with
an
air
of
concession
well
just
till
barbara
can
take
you
in
perhaps
if
you
think
london
wo
be
unbearable
but
mind
you
alex
the
minute
you
get
tired
of
it
or
feel
the
heat
too
much
for
you
you
to
make
other
arrangements
alex
wondered
dully
what
other
arrangements
cedric
supposed
that
she
could
make
she
had
no
money
and
had
never
even
roused
herself
to
write
the
letter
he
had
recommended
asking
to
have
her
allowance
sent
to
her
own
address
and
not
to
that
of
the
superior
of
the
convent
but
on
the
day
before
cedric
and
violet
with
violet
maid
and
rosemary
and
her
nurse
and
her
pram
all
took
their
departure
cedric
called
alex
into
the
study
she
went
to
him
feeling
oddly
as
though
she
was
the
little
girl
again
who
had
on
rare
occasions
been
sent
for
by
sir
francis
and
had
found
him
standing
just
so
his
back
to
the
fireplace
spectacles
in
hand
speaking
in
just
the
same
measured
rather
regretful
tones
of
kindliness
alex
i
made
out
two
cheques
one
to
cover
the
servants
board
wages
which
i
thought
you
would
be
good
enough
to
give
them
at
the
end
of
the
month
and
one
for
your
own
living
expenses
you
better
cash
that
at
once
in
case
you
want
any
ready
money
have
you
anywhere
to
keep
it
under
lock
and
key
cedric
no
more
than
sir
francis
trusted
to
a
woman
discretion
in
matters
of
money
yes
there
the
drawer
of
the
in
my
bedroom
that
will
be
all
right
then
the
servants
are
perfectly
trustworthy
no
doubt
but
loose
cash
should
never
be
left
about
in
any
case
if
you
want
more
write
to
me
and
alex
i
seen
old
pumphrey
father
man
of
business
he
will
see
that
you
get
your
fifty
pounds
here
is
the
first
instalment
cedric
gravely
handed
her
a
third
cheque
have
you
a
banking
account
i
do
think
so
then
i
arrange
to
open
one
for
you
at
my
bank
today
you
better
deposit
this
at
once
had
you
unless
you
want
anything
no
faltered
alex
not
altogether
understanding
you
will
have
no
expenses
while
you
here
of
course
said
cedric
rather
embarrassed
alex
looked
bewildered
it
had
never
occurred
to
her
to
suggest
paying
for
her
own
keep
while
she
remained
alone
at
clevedon
square
she
gave
back
to
her
brother
the
cheque
for
pounds
and
received
his
assurance
that
it
would
be
banked
in
her
name
that
afternoon
they
will
send
you
a
and
you
can
draw
out
any
small
sum
you
may
need
later
on
i
do
think
i
shall
need
any
said
alex
looking
at
the
other
two
cheques
he
had
given
her
made
payable
to
herself
and
thinking
what
a
lot
of
money
they
represented
you
will
have
a
thorough
rest
and
change
with
barbara
cedric
said
still
looking
at
her
rather
uneasily
then
when
we
meet
again
in
october
it
will
be
time
enough
he
did
not
say
what
for
and
alex
remembered
the
conversation
that
she
had
overheard
on
the
stair
with
a
feeling
of
cunning
she
was
conscious
of
her
own
determination
to
take
the
initiative
out
of
his
hands
without
his
knowledge
they
did
not
want
her
and
they
would
want
her
less
than
ever
with
all
the
approaching
business
connected
with
pamela
wedding
in
december
barbara
did
not
want
her
and
unwearingly
considering
how
to
cut
down
more
and
yet
more
expenses
alex
had
made
up
her
mind
to
go
and
live
alone
she
would
prove
to
them
that
she
could
do
it
though
they
thought
fifty
pounds
a
year
was
so
little
money
she
thought
vaguely
that
perhaps
she
could
earn
something
but
she
gave
no
hint
of
her
plans
to
any
one
knowing
that
violet
would
be
remonstrant
and
cedric
derisive
obsessed
by
this
new
idea
she
said
to
them
with
a
sort
of
furtive
eagerness
and
found
herself
alone
in
the
house
in
clevedon
square
at
first
the
quiet
and
the
solitude
were
pleasant
to
her
she
crept
round
the
big
empty
house
like
a
spirit
feeling
as
though
it
presented
a
more
familiar
aspect
with
its
shrouded
furniture
and
carefully
shaded
windows
and
the
absence
of
most
of
violet
expensive
silver
and
china
ornaments
the
library
which
was
always
kept
open
for
her
was
one
of
the
least
changed
rooms
in
the
house
and
she
spent
hours
crouched
upon
the
sofa
there
only
rousing
herself
to
go
to
the
solitary
meals
which
were
punctiliously
laid
out
for
her
in
the
big
presently
she
began
to
wonder
if
the
elderly
ellen
left
in
charge
resented
her
being
there
she
supposed
that
the
presence
of
some
one
who
never
went
out
for
whom
meals
had
to
be
provided
who
must
be
called
in
the
morning
and
supplied
with
hot
water
four
times
a
day
would
interfere
with
the
liberty
of
ellen
and
the
unseen
tweeny
who
no
doubt
cooked
for
them
they
would
be
glad
when
she
went
away
never
mind
she
would
go
very
soon
alex
felt
that
she
was
only
waiting
for
something
to
happen
which
should
give
her
the
necessary
impetus
to
carry
out
her
vague
design
of
finding
a
new
independent
foothold
for
herself
a
drowsy
week
of
very
hot
weather
slipped
by
and
then
one
morning
alex
received
three
letters
cedric
short
but
affectionate
told
her
that
violet
had
reached
scotland
tired
out
and
had
been
ordered
by
the
doctor
to
undergo
something
as
nearly
approaching
a
as
possible
she
was
to
stay
in
bed
all
the
morning
sit
in
the
garden
when
it
was
fine
and
do
nothing
she
was
to
write
no
letters
but
she
sent
alex
her
love
and
looked
forward
to
hearing
from
her
cedric
added
briefly
that
alex
was
not
to
be
at
all
anxious
violet
only
needed
quiet
and
country
air
and
no
worries
she
was
looking
better
already
alex
put
the
letter
down
reflectively
evidently
cedric
did
not
want
his
wife
disturbed
by
depressing
correspondence
and
she
did
not
mean
to
write
to
violet
of
her
new
resolution
she
even
thought
that
perhaps
she
would
continue
to
let
violet
believe
her
at
clevedon
square
or
with
barbara
her
second
letter
was
from
barbara
it
was
quite
a
long
letter
and
said
that
barbara
had
decided
to
leave
ada
at
a
convalescent
home
and
take
her
own
summer
holiday
abroad
would
alex
join
her
in
a
week
time
what
do
you
think
of
some
little
cheap
seaside
hole
in
brittany
which
we
could
do
for
very
little
i
wish
i
could
have
you
as
my
guest
dear
but
you
understand
that
all
the
disinfecting
of
the
house
has
cost
money
besides
forcing
me
to
go
away
which
i
had
meant
to
do
however
i
sure
i
need
the
change
and
i
dare
say
it
wo
do
you
any
harm
either
we
ought
to
do
the
whole
thing
for
about
fifteen
pounds
each
i
think
which
i
suppose
will
be
all
right
for
you
do
ring
me
up
tonight
and
let
exchange
views
i
sha
be
free
of
a
suspicion
as
to
these
wretched
measles
till
next
week
but
i
do
think
really
there
much
danger
as
i
had
them
already
and
am
not
in
the
least
nervous
ring
up
between
seven
and
eight
tonight
i
suppose
violet
as
usual
has
kept
on
the
telephone
even
though
they
away
themselves
alex
knew
that
she
did
not
want
to
go
abroad
with
barbara
she
nervously
picked
up
her
third
letter
which
bore
a
foreign
when
she
had
read
the
sheet
of
thin
paper
which
was
all
the
envelope
contained
she
sat
for
a
long
while
staring
at
it
the
nuns
in
rome
with
whom
she
had
spent
the
few
weeks
previous
to
her
return
to
england
had
sent
in
their
account
for
her
board
and
lodging
for
the
few
clothes
she
had
purchased
and
for
the
advance
made
her
for
her
travelling
expenses
the
sum
total
in
francs
looked
enormous
at
last
alex
trembling
managed
to
arrive
at
the
approximate
amount
in
english
money
twenty
pounds
it
seemed
to
her
exorbitant
and
she
realized
with
fresh
dismay
that
she
had
never
taken
such
a
debt
into
consideration
at
all
how
could
she
tell
cedric
she
thought
how
angry
he
would
be
at
her
strange
omission
in
never
mentioning
it
to
him
before
and
how
impossible
it
would
be
to
explain
to
him
that
she
had
as
usual
left
all
practical
issues
out
of
account
suddenly
alex
remembered
with
enormous
relief
that
pounds
lay
to
her
credit
at
the
bank
she
had
received
her
new
only
two
days
ago
she
would
go
to
the
bank
today
and
make
them
show
her
how
she
could
send
the
money
to
italy
then
cedric
and
violet
need
never
know
they
need
never
blame
her
full
of
relief
alex
took
the
that
morning
to
the
bank
she
did
not
like
having
to
display
her
ignorance
but
she
showed
the
bill
to
the
clerk
who
was
civil
and
helpful
and
showed
her
how
very
simple
a
matter
it
was
to
draw
a
cheque
for
twenty
pounds
odd
when
it
was
done
and
safely
posted
alex
trembled
with
thankfulness
it
seemed
to
her
that
it
would
have
been
a
terrible
thing
for
cedric
to
know
of
the
expenses
she
had
so
ignorantly
incurred
and
of
her
incredible
simplicity
in
never
having
realized
them
before
and
she
was
glad
that
he
need
never
know
how
almost
the
whole
of
her
allowance
of
money
had
vanished
so
soon
after
she
had
received
it
she
telephoned
to
barbara
that
night
and
said
that
she
could
not
go
abroad
with
her
oh
very
well
my
dear
if
you
think
it
wiser
not
of
course
if
you
do
london
at
this
time
of
year
it
a
tremendous
economy
to
stay
where
you
are
are
the
servants
looking
after
you
properly
oh
yes
well
do
just
as
you
like
of
course
i
think
i
shall
get
hold
of
some
friend
to
join
forces
with
me
if
you
sure
you
wo
come
quite
sure
barbara
said
alex
tremulously
she
felt
less
afraid
of
her
sister
at
the
other
end
of
the
telephone
she
went
and
saw
barbara
off
the
following
week
and
barbara
said
carelessly
alex
you
look
a
shade
better
i
think
on
the
whole
wiser
to
stay
where
you
are
i
sure
you
need
quiet
and
when
once
the
rush
begins
for
pam
wedding
you
never
get
a
minute
peace
are
you
staying
on
when
they
get
back
i
not
sure
faltered
alex
you
may
be
wise
well
come
down
to
my
part
of
the
world
if
you
want
economy
and
to
feel
as
though
you
were
out
of
london
dear
alex
was
surprised
and
rather
consoled
to
hear
barbara
alluding
so
lightly
to
the
possibility
of
her
seeking
fresh
quarters
for
herself
perhaps
after
all
they
all
thought
it
would
be
the
best
thing
for
her
to
do
perhaps
there
was
no
need
to
feel
guilty
and
as
though
her
intentions
must
be
concealed
but
alex
dreading
blame
or
disapproval
or
even
assurances
that
the
scheme
was
unpractical
and
foolish
continued
to
conceal
it
she
wrote
and
told
violet
that
she
had
decided
that
it
would
be
too
expensive
to
go
abroad
with
barbara
might
she
stay
on
in
clevedon
square
for
a
little
while
but
she
had
secretly
made
up
her
mind
to
go
and
look
for
rooms
or
a
in
hampstead
as
barbara
had
suggested
as
usual
it
was
only
by
chance
that
alex
realized
the
practical
difficulties
blocking
her
way
she
had
now
only
five
pounds
on
the
following
saturday
afternoon
she
found
her
way
out
by
omnibus
to
hampstead
she
alighted
before
the
terminus
was
reached
from
a
nervous
dread
of
being
taken
on
too
far
although
the
streets
in
which
she
found
herself
were
not
prepossessing
for
the
first
time
alex
reflected
that
she
had
no
definite
idea
as
to
where
she
wanted
to
go
in
her
search
for
lodgings
she
walked
timidly
along
the
road
which
appeared
to
be
interminably
long
and
full
of
furniture
shops
bamboo
tables
and
armchairs
with
defective
castors
were
put
out
on
the
pavement
in
many
instances
and
there
was
often
a
small
crowd
in
front
of
the
window
gazing
at
the
coloured
supplements
hung
up
within
the
pavements
and
the
road
even
the
swarmed
with
untidy
clamouring
children
alex
supposed
that
she
must
be
in
the
region
vaguely
known
to
her
as
the
slums
surely
she
could
not
live
here
then
the
recollection
of
her
solitary
five
pounds
came
to
her
with
a
pang
of
alarm
of
course
she
must
live
wherever
she
could
do
so
most
cheaply
she
had
no
idea
of
what
it
would
cost
it
was
very
hot
and
the
pavement
began
to
burn
her
feet
she
did
not
dare
to
leave
the
main
road
fearing
that
she
should
never
find
her
way
to
the
route
again
if
once
she
left
it
but
she
peeped
down
one
or
two
they
seemed
quieter
than
malden
road
but
the
unpretentious
little
grey
houses
did
not
look
as
though
lodgers
were
expected
in
any
of
them
alex
wondered
desperately
how
she
was
to
find
out
presently
she
saw
a
policeman
on
the
further
side
of
the
street
she
went
up
to
him
and
asked
can
you
tell
me
of
anywhere
near
here
where
they
let
rooms
somewhere
cheap
the
man
looked
down
at
her
white
exhausted
face
and
at
the
coat
and
skirt
chosen
by
barbara
which
yet
hung
loosely
and
badly
on
her
stooping
shrunken
figure
somebody
poor
relation
was
his
unspoken
comment
is
it
for
yourself
miss
you
hardly
care
to
be
in
this
neighbourhood
would
you
i
want
to
be
somewhere
near
hampstead
and
somewhere
very
very
cheap
alex
faltered
thinking
of
her
five
pounds
which
lay
at
that
moment
in
the
purse
she
was
clasping
well
you
find
as
cheap
here
as
anywhere
if
you
do
mind
the
noise
oh
no
said
alex
who
had
never
slept
within
the
sound
of
traffic
surprised
then
if
i
was
you
miss
i
try
no
malden
road
just
beyond
the
that
is
or
else
two
doors
further
up
i
saw
cards
up
in
both
windows
with
inside
the
last
week
thank
you
said
alex
she
wished
that
malden
road
had
looked
more
like
downshire
hill
which
had
trees
and
little
tiny
gardens
in
front
of
the
houses
which
almost
all
resembled
country
cottages
but
no
doubt
houses
in
downshire
hill
did
not
let
rooms
or
if
so
they
must
be
too
expensive
besides
alex
felt
almost
sure
that
barbara
would
not
want
her
as
a
very
near
neighbour
she
was
very
tired
when
she
reached
no
and
almost
felt
that
she
would
take
the
rooms
whatever
they
were
like
to
save
herself
further
search
after
all
she
could
change
later
on
if
she
did
not
like
them
like
all
weak
people
alex
felt
the
urgent
necessity
of
acting
as
quickly
as
possible
on
her
own
impulses
she
looked
distastefully
at
the
dingy
house
with
its
paint
cracking
into
hard
flakes
and
raised
the
knocker
slowly
a
jagged
end
of
protruding
wire
at
the
side
of
the
door
proclaimed
that
the
bell
was
broken
her
timid
knock
was
answered
by
a
young
woman
wearing
an
apron
whom
alex
took
to
be
the
servant
can
i
see
the
the
landlady
is
it
about
a
room
i
mrs
she
spoke
in
the
harshest
possible
cockney
but
quite
pleasantly
oh
said
alex
still
uncertain
yes
i
want
rooms
please
the
woman
looked
her
swiftly
up
and
down
only
one
vacant
miss
and
that
at
the
top
of
the
would
you
care
to
see
that
yes
please
hoxton
slammed
the
door
and
preceded
alex
up
a
narrow
staircase
carpeted
with
on
the
third
floor
she
threw
open
the
door
of
a
room
considerably
smaller
than
the
at
clevedon
square
containing
a
low
iron
bed
and
an
iron
tripod
bearing
an
enamel
basin
a
chipped
pitcher
and
a
very
small
a
framed
in
mottled
yellow
plush
was
hung
crookedly
on
the
wall
and
beneath
it
stood
a
wooden
kitchen
chair
there
was
a
little
table
with
two
drawers
in
it
behind
the
door
alex
looked
round
her
with
bewilderment
a
convent
cell
was
no
smaller
than
this
and
presented
a
greater
aspect
of
space
from
its
bareness
is
there
a
she
inquired
not
separate
to
this
no
miss
this
is
called
small
but
then
i
suppose
you
be
out
all
day
for
a
moment
alex
wondered
why
but
meals
she
asked
feebly
would
it
be
more
than
just
the
breakfast
and
supper
and
three
meals
on
sunday
alex
did
not
know
what
to
answer
and
hoxton
surveyed
her
where
are
you
working
miss
anywhere
near
i
not
working
anywhere
yet
hoxton
manner
changed
a
little
if
you
want
two
rooms
miss
and
full
board
i
could
accommodate
you
downstairs
the
price
is
according
of
course
a
week
in
advance
and
pay
by
the
week
alex
followed
the
woman
downstairs
again
she
was
sure
that
this
was
not
the
kind
of
place
where
she
wanted
to
live
hoxton
showed
her
into
a
larger
bedroom
on
the
first
floor
just
opening
the
door
and
giving
alex
a
glimpse
of
extreme
untidiness
and
an
unmade
bed
my
gentleman
got
up
late
today
he
do
go
to
job
saturdays
so
i
put
the
room
to
rights
yet
but
it
a
nice
room
miss
and
will
be
vacant
on
monday
it
goes
with
the
downstairs
in
the
front
as
a
rule
but
that
to
be
turned
into
a
bedroom
just
lately
i
been
so
crowded
will
that
be
empty
on
monday
too
asked
alex
for
the
sake
of
answering
something
tonight
miss
i
let
a
coloured
gentleman
it
a
student
you
know
a
thing
i
never
done
before
either
other
people
do
like
it
and
it
gives
a
name
like
for
not
being
particular
who
one
takes
so
going
and
i
sha
be
sorry
i
do
with
making
talk
and
it
is
as
though
the
room
would
let
easy
it
a
beautiful
room
miss
the
coloured
gentleman
room
was
tidier
than
the
one
upstairs
but
a
haze
of
stale
tobacco
fumes
hung
round
it
and
obscured
alex
view
of
a
short
leather
sofa
with
horsehair
breaking
from
it
in
patches
a
small
round
table
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
a
window
looking
on
to
the
traffic
of
malden
road
about
terms
miss
hoxton
began
suggestively
in
the
passage
oh
i
could
afford
much
alex
began
thinking
that
it
was
more
difficult
than
she
had
supposed
to
walk
out
again
saying
that
she
did
not
after
all
want
the
rooms
i
let
you
those
two
rooms
and
full
board
for
a
week
cried
the
landlady
oh
i
do
think
hoxton
shrugged
her
shoulders
looked
at
the
ceiling
and
said
resignedly
then
i
suppose
we
must
call
it
two
guineas
though
i
ought
to
ask
double
but
you
can
come
in
right
away
on
monday
miss
and
i
think
you
find
it
all
comfortable
but
said
alex
faintly
she
felt
very
tired
and
the
thought
of
a
further
search
for
lodgings
wearied
her
and
almost
frightened
her
besides
the
policeman
had
told
her
that
this
was
a
cheap
neighbourhood
perhaps
anywhere
else
they
would
charge
much
more
finally
she
temporized
feebly
with
the
reflection
that
it
need
only
be
for
a
week
once
the
step
of
leaving
clevedon
square
had
been
definitely
taken
she
could
feel
herself
free
to
find
a
more
congenial
habitation
at
her
leisure
and
when
she
might
feel
less
desperately
tired
she
sighed
as
she
followed
the
line
of
least
resistance
well
i
come
on
monday
then
yes
miss
the
landlady
answered
promptly
may
i
have
your
name
miss
and
the
first
week
in
advance
my
rule
as
i
think
i
mentioned
my
name
is
miss
clare
alex
took
two
sovereigns
and
two
shillings
fumbling
out
of
her
purse
and
handed
them
to
the
woman
it
did
not
occur
to
her
to
ask
for
any
form
of
receipt
will
you
be
wanting
anything
on
monday
miss
alex
looked
uncomprehending
and
the
woman
eyed
her
with
scarcely
veiled
contempt
and
added
supper
or
anything
oh
yes
i
better
come
in
time
for
dinner
for
supper
i
mean
yes
miss
seven
will
do
you
i
suppose
alex
thought
it
sounded
very
early
but
she
did
not
feel
that
she
cared
at
all
and
said
that
seven
would
do
quite
well
she
wondered
if
there
were
any
questions
which
she
ought
to
ask
but
could
think
of
none
and
she
was
rather
afraid
of
the
woman
but
hoxton
seemed
to
be
quite
satisfied
and
pulled
open
the
door
as
though
it
was
obvious
that
the
interview
had
come
to
an
end
good
afternoon
said
alex
afternoon
answered
the
landlady
as
she
slammed
the
door
again
almost
before
alex
was
on
the
pavement
of
malden
road
she
went
away
with
a
strangely
sinking
heart
to
what
had
she
committed
herself
all
the
arguments
which
alex
had
been
brooding
over
seemed
to
crumble
away
from
her
now
that
she
had
taken
definite
action
she
repeated
to
herself
again
that
violet
and
cedric
did
not
want
her
that
barbara
did
not
want
her
that
there
was
no
place
for
her
anywhere
and
that
it
was
best
for
her
to
make
her
own
arrangements
and
spare
them
all
the
necessity
of
viewing
her
in
the
light
of
a
problem
but
what
would
cedric
say
to
malden
road
inwardly
alex
resolved
that
he
must
never
come
there
if
she
said
hampstead
he
would
think
that
she
was
somewhere
close
to
barbara
pretty
little
house
but
barbara
alex
sank
utterly
jaded
into
the
vacant
space
in
a
crowded
omnibus
it
was
full
outside
and
the
atmosphere
of
heat
and
humanity
inside
made
her
feel
giddy
arguments
and
sick
apprehensions
surged
in
chaotic
bewilderment
through
her
mind
xxvii
the
embezzlement
alex
full
of
unreasoning
panic
made
her
move
to
malden
road
she
was
afraid
of
the
servants
in
clevedon
square
all
of
them
new
since
she
had
left
england
and
only
told
ellen
with
confusion
that
she
was
leaving
london
for
the
present
she
was
unaccountably
relieved
when
ellen
only
said
impassively
very
good
miss
and
packed
her
slender
belongings
without
comment
or
question
suddenly
she
remembered
the
cheque
which
cedric
had
given
her
for
the
servants
she
looked
at
it
doubtfully
her
own
money
was
already
almost
exhausted
thanks
to
that
unexpected
claim
from
the
convent
in
rome
and
alex
supposed
that
the
sum
still
in
her
purse
amounting
to
rather
less
than
three
pounds
would
only
last
her
for
about
a
fortnight
in
malden
road
she
decided
with
no
sense
of
doubt
that
she
had
better
keep
cedric
cheque
it
was
only
a
little
sum
to
him
and
he
would
send
money
for
the
servants
he
had
said
that
he
was
ready
to
advance
money
to
his
sister
characteristically
alex
dismissed
the
matter
from
her
mind
as
unimportant
she
had
never
learnt
any
accepted
code
in
dealings
with
money
and
her
own
instinct
led
her
to
believe
it
an
unessential
question
she
judged
only
from
her
own
feelings
which
would
have
remained
quite
unstirred
by
any
emotions
but
those
the
most
at
any
claim
direct
or
indirect
justifiable
or
not
upon
her
purse
she
had
never
learnt
the
rudiments
of
pride
or
of
in
questions
of
finance
but
in
malden
road
alex
was
after
all
to
learn
many
things
there
were
material
considerations
equally
unknown
to
clevedon
square
and
to
the
austere
but
systematic
of
convent
necessities
which
were
brought
home
to
her
with
a
startled
sense
of
dismay
from
her
first
evening
at
she
had
never
thought
of
bringing
soap
with
her
or
boxes
of
matches
yet
these
commodities
did
not
appear
as
a
matter
of
course
as
they
had
always
done
elsewhere
there
was
gas
in
both
the
rooms
but
there
were
no
candles
there
was
no
hot
water
you
can
boil
your
own
kettle
on
the
on
the
landing
hoxton
said
indifferently
and
left
her
new
lodger
to
the
realization
that
the
purchase
of
a
kettle
had
never
occurred
to
her
at
all
buying
the
kettle
and
a
supply
of
candles
and
matches
and
soap
left
her
with
only
just
enough
money
in
hand
for
her
second
week
rent
and
when
she
wanted
notepaper
and
ink
and
stamps
to
write
to
barbara
alex
decided
that
she
must
appropriate
cedric
cheque
for
the
wages
to
her
own
uses
she
felt
hardly
any
qualms
this
was
like
that
bill
from
rome
which
she
would
have
been
afraid
to
let
him
see
he
would
have
talked
about
the
dishonesty
of
convents
and
asked
why
she
had
not
told
him
sooner
of
their
charges
against
her
and
have
looked
at
her
with
that
almost
incredulous
expression
of
amazed
disgust
had
she
admitted
her
entire
oblivion
of
the
whole
consideration
but
this
cheque
for
the
servants
it
would
enable
her
to
pay
her
own
expenses
until
she
could
get
the
work
which
she
still
vaguely
anticipated
and
the
sum
meant
nothing
to
cedric
she
would
write
and
tell
him
that
she
had
cashed
the
money
sure
that
he
would
not
mind
in
fulfilment
of
his
many
requests
to
her
to
look
upon
him
as
her
banker
but
she
did
not
write
though
she
cashed
the
cheque
the
days
slipped
by
in
a
sort
of
monotonous
discomfort
but
it
was
very
hot
and
she
learnt
to
find
her
way
to
hampstead
heath
where
she
could
sit
for
hours
not
reading
for
she
had
no
books
but
brooding
in
a
sort
of
despairing
resignation
over
the
past
and
the
present
the
conviction
remained
with
her
ineradicably
that
the
whole
thing
was
a
dream
that
she
would
wake
up
again
to
the
london
of
the
middle
and
find
herself
a
young
girl
again
healthy
and
eager
and
troubling
lady
isabel
and
more
remotely
sir
francis
with
her
modern
exigencies
and
demands
to
live
her
own
life
the
of
those
clamorous
and
of
which
the
young
new
century
had
so
easily
reaped
the
harvest
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
believe
that
her
own
life
had
been
lived
and
that
only
this
was
left
alex
sometimes
felt
that
she
was
not
alive
at
all
that
she
was
only
a
shade
moving
amongst
the
living
unable
to
get
into
real
communication
with
any
of
them
she
did
not
think
of
the
future
there
was
no
future
for
her
there
was
only
an
irrevocable
past
and
a
sordid
yet
present
that
clung
round
her
spirit
as
a
damp
mist
might
have
clung
round
her
person
intangible
and
yet
penetrating
and
hampering
and
stifling
her
the
modicum
of
physical
strength
which
she
had
regained
in
clevedon
square
was
ebbing
imperceptibly
from
her
it
was
difficult
to
sleep
very
well
in
malden
road
where
the
trams
and
the
omnibuses
passed
in
incessant
jerking
succession
and
the
children
screamed
in
the
road
late
at
nights
and
incredibly
early
in
the
mornings
the
food
was
neither
good
nor
well
prepared
but
alex
ate
little
in
the
heat
and
reflected
that
it
was
an
economy
not
to
be
hungry
the
need
for
economy
was
being
gradually
borne
in
upon
her
as
her
small
stock
of
money
diminished
and
there
came
nothing
to
replace
it
presently
she
exerted
herself
to
find
a
registry
office
where
she
gave
her
name
and
address
and
was
contemptuously
and
suspiciously
eyed
by
an
old
lady
with
dyed
red
hair
who
sat
at
a
and
asked
her
a
fee
of
for
entering
her
name
in
a
ledger
no
diplomas
and
no
certificate
wo
take
you
far
in
teaching
she
said
unpleasantly
languages
french
quite
well
and
a
little
italian
enough
to
give
conversation
lessons
alex
faltered
no
demand
for
whatever
i
let
you
know
but
do
expect
anything
to
turn
up
especially
at
this
time
of
year
with
every
one
out
of
town
but
by
a
miraculous
stroke
of
fortune
something
did
turn
up
the
woman
from
the
registry
office
sent
alex
a
laconic
postcard
giving
her
the
address
of
a
lady
singer
in
camden
town
who
was
willing
to
pay
two
shillings
an
hour
in
return
for
sufficient
instruction
in
italian
to
enable
her
to
sing
italian
songs
elated
alex
looked
out
the
conversation
manual
of
her
convent
days
and
at
three
set
out
to
find
the
address
in
camden
town
she
discovered
it
with
difficulty
and
arrived
late
the
appointed
hour
had
been
three
shown
into
a
small
crowded
with
furniture
and
plastered
with
signed
photographs
she
sank
breathless
and
heated
into
a
chair
and
waited
the
lady
singer
when
she
came
was
irate
at
the
delay
her
manner
frightened
alex
who
acquiesced
in
bewildered
humiliation
to
a
stipulation
that
only
must
be
charged
for
the
curtailed
hour
she
gave
her
lesson
badly
imparting
information
with
a
hesitation
that
even
to
her
own
ears
sounded
as
though
she
were
uncertain
of
her
facts
however
her
pupil
ungraciously
drew
out
a
shilling
from
a
small
and
gave
it
to
alex
when
she
left
and
she
bade
her
come
again
in
three
days
time
the
lessons
went
on
for
three
weeks
they
tired
alex
strangely
but
she
felt
glad
that
she
could
earn
money
however
little
and
although
the
shillings
went
almost
at
once
in
small
necessities
which
she
had
somehow
never
foreseen
it
was
not
until
the
middle
of
september
that
she
began
once
more
to
reach
the
end
of
her
resources
just
as
she
had
decided
that
it
would
be
necessary
for
her
to
write
to
cedric
she
received
a
letter
from
him
forwarded
from
her
bank
alex
turned
white
as
she
read
it
my
dear
alex
i
am
altogether
at
a
loss
to
understand
why
ellen
the
at
home
writes
to
violet
on
friday
last
that
you
have
left
clevedon
square
and
that
she
and
the
other
servant
have
not
yet
received
the
money
for
their
board
and
wages
this
last
i
take
to
be
an
oversight
on
your
part
but
you
will
doubtless
put
it
right
at
once
since
you
will
remember
that
i
handed
you
a
cheque
for
that
purpose
just
before
leaving
london
as
to
your
own
movements
i
need
hardly
say
my
dear
alex
that
i
do
not
claim
to
have
any
sort
of
authority
over
them
of
whatever
kind
but
both
violet
and
i
can
not
help
feeling
that
it
would
have
been
more
friendly
to
say
the
least
of
it
had
you
given
us
some
hint
as
to
your
intentions
knowing
that
barbara
is
already
abroad
and
pamela
with
her
friends
yachting
i
can
only
hope
that
you
have
received
some
unforeseen
invitation
which
appealed
to
you
more
than
the
prospect
of
solitude
in
clevedon
square
it
would
have
been
desirable
had
you
left
your
address
with
the
servants
but
i
presume
the
matter
escaped
your
memory
as
they
appear
to
be
completely
in
the
dark
as
to
your
movements
violet
is
looking
quite
herself
again
and
sends
many
affectionate
messages
she
will
doubtless
write
to
you
on
receipt
of
a
few
lines
giving
her
your
address
i
am
compelled
to
send
this
letter
through
the
care
of
williams
which
you
will
agree
with
me
is
an
unnecessarily
elaborate
method
of
communication
your
affectionate
brother
cedric
clare
alex
was
carried
back
through
the
years
to
the
sense
of
remorse
and
bewilderment
with
which
she
had
listened
to
the
measured
irrefutable
condemnations
expressed
with
the
same
unerring
precision
of
sir
francis
clare
she
realized
herself
again
sick
with
crying
and
cold
with
terror
standing
shaking
before
his
relentless
justice
knowing
herself
to
be
again
for
ever
and
hopelessly
in
the
wrong
she
would
never
be
anything
else
she
knew
it
now
her
sense
of
honour
of
truth
and
justice
was
perverted
in
direct
disaccord
with
that
of
the
world
what
would
her
brother
say
to
her
misuse
of
the
money
that
he
had
entrusted
to
her
alex
knew
now
with
sudden
terrifying
certainty
how
he
would
view
the
transaction
which
had
seemed
to
her
so
simple
an
expedient
she
knew
that
even
were
she
able
to
make
the
almost
incredible
plea
of
a
sudden
temptation
a
desperate
need
of
money
that
had
led
her
voluntarily
to
commit
an
act
of
dishonesty
it
would
stand
her
in
better
stead
than
a
mere
statement
of
the
terrible
truth
that
no
voice
within
her
had
told
her
of
dishonour
that
she
had
outrageous
paradox
committed
an
act
of
dishonesty
in
good
faith
to
cedric
the
lack
in
her
would
seem
so
utterly
perverted
so
incomprehensible
that
there
would
appear
to
be
no
possibility
of
that
forgiveness
which
as
a
christian
he
could
consciously
have
extended
to
any
wilful
breaking
of
the
law
but
there
would
be
no
question
of
forgiveness
for
this
it
was
not
the
money
alex
knew
that
it
was
her
own
extraordinary
moral
deficiency
that
put
her
outside
the
pale
perhaps
thought
alex
drearily
this
was
how
criminals
always
felt
they
did
the
things
for
which
they
were
punished
because
of
some
flaw
in
their
mental
outlook
they
did
see
that
the
things
mattered
until
it
was
too
late
they
had
to
be
saved
from
themselves
by
punishment
or
removal
or
sometimes
by
death
and
for
the
protection
of
the
rest
of
the
community
too
it
was
necessary
to
penalize
those
who
could
not
or
would
not
conform
to
the
standard
alex
saw
it
all
but
dimly
involuntarily
almost
an
echo
from
her
childhood
days
came
back
to
her
vaguely
formulated
into
words
take
the
part
of
the
people
in
the
wrong
they
need
it
the
only
conviction
to
which
she
could
lay
claim
was
somehow
embodied
in
that
sentiment
xxviii
cedric
she
wrote
to
cedric
the
sense
of
having
put
herself
irrevocably
in
the
wrong
by
her
own
act
making
her
explanation
into
an
utterly
bald
lifeless
statement
of
fact
she
felt
entirely
unable
to
enter
into
any
analysis
of
her
folly
and
besides
it
would
have
been
of
no
use
facts
were
facts
she
had
taken
cedric
money
which
he
had
given
her
for
one
purpose
and
used
it
for
another
there
had
not
even
been
any
violent
struggle
with
temptation
to
palliate
the
act
alex
felt
a
sort
of
dazed
stupefaction
at
herself
she
was
bad
she
told
herself
bad
all
through
and
this
was
how
bad
people
felt
sick
with
disappointment
and
utterly
unavailing
remorse
knowing
all
the
time
that
there
was
no
strength
in
them
ever
to
resist
any
temptation
however
base
she
wondered
if
there
was
a
hell
as
the
convent
teaching
had
so
definitely
told
her
if
so
alex
shudderingly
contemplated
her
doom
but
she
prayed
desperately
that
there
might
be
nothing
after
death
but
utter
oblivion
it
was
then
that
the
thought
of
death
first
came
to
her
not
with
the
wild
impotent
longing
of
her
days
of
struggle
but
with
an
insidious
suggestion
of
rest
and
escape
she
played
with
the
idea
but
for
the
most
part
her
faculties
were
absorbed
in
the
increasing
strain
of
waiting
for
cedric
reply
to
her
confession
it
came
in
the
shape
of
a
telegram
shall
be
in
london
wednesday
will
you
lunch
clevedon
square
reply
paid
alex
felt
an
unreasonable
relief
both
at
the
postponement
of
an
immediate
crisis
and
at
the
reflection
that
at
all
events
cedric
did
not
mean
to
come
to
malden
road
she
did
not
want
him
to
see
those
strange
sordid
surroundings
to
which
she
had
fled
from
the
shelter
of
her
old
home
alex
telegraphed
an
affirmative
reply
to
her
brother
and
waited
in
growing
apathy
for
the
interview
which
she
could
now
only
dread
in
theory
her
sense
of
feeling
seemed
numbed
at
last
something
of
the
old
terror
however
revived
when
she
confronted
cedric
again
in
the
library
he
greeted
her
with
a
sort
of
kindly
seriousness
under
which
she
wonderingly
detected
a
certain
nervousness
during
lunch
they
spoke
of
violet
of
the
shooting
that
cedric
had
been
enjoying
in
scotland
the
slight
shade
of
pomposity
which
recalled
sir
francis
was
always
discernible
in
all
cedric
kindly
courtesy
as
host
after
lunch
he
rather
ceremoniously
ushered
his
sister
into
the
library
again
sit
down
my
dear
you
look
tired
you
do
smoke
i
know
mind
if
i
he
drew
at
his
pipe
once
or
twice
then
carefully
rammed
the
tobacco
more
tightly
into
the
bowl
with
a
finger
still
gazing
at
the
wedged
black
mass
he
said
in
a
voice
of
careful
unconcern
about
this
move
of
yours
alex
violet
and
i
could
altogether
understand
that
really
what
brought
me
down
and
the
question
of
that
cheque
i
gave
you
for
the
servants
i
could
quite
make
out
your
letter
he
paused
as
though
to
give
her
an
opportunity
for
speech
still
looking
away
from
her
but
alex
remained
silent
in
a
sort
of
paralysis
suppose
we
take
one
question
at
a
time
suggested
cedric
pleasantly
the
cheque
affair
is
of
course
a
very
small
one
and
quite
easily
cleared
up
one
only
has
to
be
scrupulous
in
money
matters
because
they
money
matters
you
know
father
way
of
thinking
and
i
must
say
i
entirely
share
it
there
was
no
need
to
tell
alex
so
have
you
got
the
cheque
with
you
alex
no
said
alex
at
last
did
you
understand
my
letter
then
cedric
spectacles
began
to
tap
slowly
against
the
back
of
his
left
hand
held
in
the
loose
grasp
of
his
right
you
er
cashed
that
cheque
yes
alex
felt
as
though
she
were
being
put
to
the
torture
of
the
inquisition
but
was
utterly
unable
to
do
more
than
reply
in
monosyllables
to
cedric
level
judicial
questions
may
i
ask
to
what
purpose
you
applied
the
money
cedric
it
not
fair
broke
from
alex
i
written
and
told
you
what
i
did
i
needed
money
and
i
i
thought
you
would
mind
i
used
it
for
myself
and
i
meant
to
write
and
tell
you
you
thought
i
would
mind
repeated
cedric
in
tones
of
stupefaction
you
said
you
would
advance
me
money
i
knew
you
could
write
another
cheque
for
the
servants
wages
i
i
did
think
of
your
minding
mind
said
cedric
again
with
reiteration
worthy
of
his
nursery
days
my
dear
girl
you
do
suppose
it
the
money
i
mind
do
you
no
no
i
ought
to
have
asked
you
first
but
i
did
think
it
seemed
a
natural
thing
to
do
good
lord
alex
cried
cedric
more
moved
than
she
had
ever
seen
him
do
you
understand
what
you
saying
a
natural
thing
to
do
to
tears
of
terror
and
of
utter
bewilderment
seized
on
alex
enfeebled
powers
and
deprived
her
of
utterance
cedric
began
to
pace
the
library
speaking
rapidly
and
without
looking
at
her
if
you
only
written
and
told
me
what
you
done
at
once
though
heaven
knows
that
would
have
been
bad
enough
but
to
do
a
thing
like
that
and
then
let
it
rest
did
you
know
that
it
be
found
out
sooner
or
later
he
cast
a
fleeting
glance
at
alex
who
sat
with
the
tears
pouring
down
her
quivering
face
but
she
said
nothing
it
was
of
no
use
to
explain
to
cedric
that
she
had
never
thought
of
not
being
found
out
she
had
meant
no
concealment
she
had
thought
her
action
so
simple
a
one
that
it
had
hardly
needed
explanation
or
justification
it
had
merely
been
not
worth
while
to
write
cedric
voice
went
on
gradually
gaining
in
power
as
the
agitation
that
had
shaken
him
subsided
under
his
own
fluency
you
know
that
it
a
prosecutable
offence
alex
of
course
there
no
question
of
such
a
thing
but
to
trade
on
that
certainty
alex
made
an
inarticulate
sound
violet
says
of
course
you
did
know
what
you
were
doing
that
wretched
place
that
convent
has
played
havoc
with
you
altogether
when
i
think
of
those
people
cedric
face
darkened
but
hang
it
alex
you
were
brought
up
like
the
rest
of
us
and
on
a
question
of
honour
think
of
father
alex
had
stopped
crying
she
was
about
to
make
her
last
stand
with
the
last
strength
that
in
her
lay
cedric
listen
to
me
you
must
you
do
understand
i
did
look
at
it
from
your
point
of
view
i
did
see
it
like
that
there
something
wrong
with
me
there
must
be
but
it
did
seem
to
me
to
matter
i
know
you
wo
believe
me
but
i
thought
the
money
was
quite
a
little
unimportant
thing
and
that
you
understand
and
say
i
done
right
to
take
it
for
granted
that
i
might
have
it
but
it
the
money
groaned
cedric
though
what
on
earth
you
wanted
it
for
when
you
had
no
expenses
and
your
allowance
just
paid
in
but
that
not
the
point
ca
you
see
alex
it
not
this
wretched
cheque
in
itself
it
the
principle
of
the
thing
alex
gazed
at
him
quite
hopelessly
the
flickering
spark
of
spirit
died
out
and
left
her
soul
in
darkness
cedric
faced
her
i
could
believe
that
your
letter
really
meant
what
it
seemed
to
mean
he
said
slowly
but
if
it
does
as
on
your
own
showing
it
does
then
i
understand
your
leaving
us
needless
to
say
where
are
you
living
what
is
this
place
malden
road
characteristically
he
drew
out
her
letter
and
referred
to
the
address
carefully
where
is
malden
road
in
hampstead
near
barbara
are
you
in
rooms
yes
how
did
you
find
them
who
recommended
them
she
made
no
answer
and
cedric
gazed
at
her
with
an
expression
of
perplexity
you
are
entitled
to
keep
your
own
counsel
of
course
and
to
make
your
own
arrangements
but
i
must
say
alex
that
the
thought
of
you
disturbs
me
very
much
your
whole
position
is
unusual
and
your
attitude
makes
it
almost
impossible
to
he
broke
off
violet
begged
me
quite
unnecessarily
but
you
know
what
she
is
not
to
let
you
feel
as
though
there
were
any
estrangement
to
say
that
whatever
arrangement
you
preferred
should
be
made
of
course
pamela
marriage
will
add
to
your
resources
you
understand
that
she
is
marrying
an
extremely
wealthy
man
and
i
shall
have
not
the
slightest
hesitation
in
allowing
her
to
make
over
her
share
of
father
money
to
you
as
soon
as
it
can
be
arranged
she
wishes
it
herself
he
paused
as
though
for
some
expression
of
gratitude
from
alex
but
she
made
none
pam
had
everything
and
now
she
was
to
have
the
credit
and
pleasure
of
a
generosity
which
would
cost
her
nothing
as
well
alex
maintained
a
bitter
silence
the
obvious
course
is
for
you
to
join
barbara
paying
your
half
of
expenses
as
you
will
now
be
enabled
to
do
barbara
does
want
me
it
is
the
natural
arrangement
repeated
cedric
inflexibly
and
i
must
add
alex
that
you
seem
to
me
to
be
terribly
unfitted
to
manage
your
own
life
in
any
way
if
what
you
have
told
me
is
the
case
i
can
only
infer
that
your
moral
sense
is
completely
perverted
i
could
have
believed
it
of
one
of
us
of
one
of
my
father
children
alex
knew
that
the
of
cedric
character
was
reached
she
had
come
to
the
point
where
for
cedric
right
and
wrong
began
and
ended
honour
they
would
never
get
any
nearer
to
one
another
now
the
fundamental
principle
which
governed
life
for
cedric
was
deficient
in
alex
she
got
up
slowly
and
began
to
pull
on
her
shabby
gloves
will
you
forgive
me
cedric
she
half
sobbed
it
is
a
question
of
forgiveness
of
course
i
will
but
if
you
only
asked
me
for
that
wretched
money
alex
what
you
did
was
to
embezzle
it
neither
more
nor
less
oh
good
lord
he
looked
at
her
with
fresh
despair
and
then
rang
the
bell
you
going
to
have
a
taxi
he
told
her
authoritatively
you
not
fit
to
go
any
other
way
alex
my
dear
i
give
my
right
hand
for
this
not
to
have
happened
for
heaven
sake
come
to
me
if
you
want
anything
how
much
shall
i
give
you
now
he
unlocked
the
drawer
agitatedly
alex
thought
to
herself
hysterically
he
thinks
i
may
money
perhaps
from
somebody
else
if
i
want
it
and
i
and
with
a
sense
of
degradation
that
made
her
feel
physically
sick
she
put
into
her
purse
the
gold
and
the
pile
of
silver
that
he
pushed
into
her
hand
cedric
straightened
himself
and
taking
off
his
glasses
wiped
them
carefully
write
to
me
alex
and
let
me
know
what
you
want
to
do
barbara
will
be
back
soon
you
go
to
her
at
any
rate
for
a
time
till
after
pamela
wedding
you
know
that
fixed
for
december
now
and
my
dear
for
heaven
sake
let
forget
this
ghastly
business
no
one
on
this
earth
but
you
and
i
and
violet
need
ever
know
of
it
no
said
alex
she
looked
at
him
with
despair
invading
her
whole
being
cedric
you
been
very
very
kind
to
me
the
taxi
is
at
the
door
sir
thank
you
cedric
took
his
sister
into
the
hall
and
she
gave
a
curious
fleeting
glance
round
her
at
the
familiar
surroundings
and
at
the
broad
staircase
where
the
clare
children
had
run
up
and
down
and
played
and
quarrelled
together
in
that
other
existence
dear
write
your
plans
and
come
and
see
us
as
soon
as
we
get
back
it
wo
be
more
than
a
week
or
two
now
cedric
put
her
into
the
waiting
taxi
and
stood
on
the
steps
looking
after
her
as
the
cab
turned
out
of
clevedon
square
and
alex
crouched
into
a
corner
of
the
taxi
knew
herself
capable
of
any
treachery
any
moral
infamy
to
which
she
might
be
tempted
since
cedric
had
been
right
when
he
said
that
her
sense
of
honour
of
fundamental
rectitude
was
completely
perverted
xxix
forgiveness
the
weather
broke
suddenly
and
it
became
cold
and
rainy
for
two
or
three
days
alex
sat
in
her
at
malden
road
and
heard
the
trams
and
the
omnibuses
clash
past
and
the
children
screaming
to
one
another
in
the
street
she
could
hardly
have
said
when
she
had
first
realized
that
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
go
on
living
but
the
determination
now
that
it
was
there
had
brought
with
it
a
sense
of
utter
finality
for
two
or
three
days
she
felt
stunned
and
yet
driven
by
a
desperate
feeling
that
it
was
necessary
for
her
to
think
to
make
a
plan
but
she
could
not
think
then
one
evening
hoxton
the
landlady
said
to
her
curiously
would
you
like
a
fire
tonight
she
seldom
said
miss
in
speaking
to
alex
it
so
chilly
all
of
a
sudden
and
you
look
ill
really
now
you
do
alex
felt
rather
surprised
perhaps
she
was
ill
which
would
account
for
the
impossibility
of
consecutive
thought
a
fire
would
be
very
nice
she
shivered
involuntarily
looking
at
her
little
empty
grate
crammed
with
cut
paper
she
remembered
that
there
was
no
need
to
consider
expense
any
more
yes
i
like
a
fire
please
she
said
gently
and
that
evening
she
sat
close
to
the
pleasant
blaze
flickering
on
the
wall
and
dimly
recalling
to
her
the
nursery
at
clevedon
square
in
the
old
days
and
the
power
of
thought
came
back
to
her
it
was
as
though
the
warmth
and
companionship
of
the
flames
had
suddenly
unsealed
something
frozen
up
within
her
and
she
became
more
herself
than
she
had
been
for
many
months
with
the
horrible
pressing
dread
of
an
unbearable
present
and
an
unimaginable
future
lifted
from
her
heart
alex
felt
a
pervading
lucidity
of
thought
to
which
she
had
for
years
been
a
stranger
take
possession
of
her
she
knew
suddenly
that
she
was
for
a
little
while
to
regain
faculties
that
had
been
atrophied
within
her
since
the
far
free
days
of
her
girlhood
she
began
to
reflect
why
had
life
to
which
she
had
looked
forward
so
eagerly
with
such
confident
anticipation
of
some
wonderful
happiness
which
should
be
in
proportion
to
the
immense
capacity
for
realizing
it
which
she
knew
to
exist
within
her
have
proved
to
be
only
a
succession
of
defeats
of
receding
hopes
and
of
unfulfilled
desires
alex
did
not
question
that
the
fault
lay
with
herself
from
her
baby
days
under
the
unvarnished
plain
speaking
of
old
nurse
she
had
known
herself
to
be
the
black
sheep
of
every
flock
and
she
had
not
sinned
splendidly
dramatically
either
her
sins
had
been
those
of
petty
meanness
of
shirking
and
evading
of
small
and
childish
tyranny
at
the
expense
of
others
of
vulgar
lies
and
those
sins
which
find
little
or
no
place
in
the
decalogue
and
which
stand
lowest
in
the
scale
by
which
the
opinion
of
others
is
meted
out
to
us
those
are
the
things
which
are
not
forgiven
that
was
it
alex
told
herself
with
a
feeling
of
having
suddenly
struck
the
keynote
forgiveness
forgiveness
was
the
key
to
everything
alex
in
the
sudden
surety
of
vision
that
had
come
to
her
did
not
doubt
that
her
own
interpretation
of
the
word
was
the
right
one
forgiveness
meant
understanding
not
condemnation
and
subsequent
pardon
it
did
not
mean
the
bewildered
scandalized
and
yet
regretful
oblivion
to
which
cedric
would
consign
her
memory
and
that
of
her
many
failings
it
did
not
mean
detached
indifferent
kindness
carefully
measured
in
terms
of
material
resources
nor
pamela
and
archie
patronage
in
mirth
of
which
the
very
object
was
the
gulf
that
separated
them
from
their
sister
it
did
not
even
mean
violet
soft
pity
and
unresentful
acceptance
of
facts
that
amazed
her
looking
further
back
alex
knew
that
it
did
not
mean
either
the
serious
perplexed
pardon
that
sir
francis
had
tendered
to
his
troublesome
daughter
or
lady
isabel
remonstrances
it
did
not
in
any
way
occur
to
her
to
blame
them
for
a
lack
of
which
she
had
all
her
life
been
subconsciously
aware
in
all
their
forbearance
she
told
herself
with
a
fresh
sense
of
enlightenment
that
they
had
not
understood
because
it
was
in
none
of
them
to
have
yielded
to
those
temptations
which
had
beset
and
mastered
her
so
easily
measuring
her
frailty
by
their
own
strength
they
had
only
seen
her
utter
failure
in
resistance
and
been
shamed
and
grieved
by
it
alex
knew
that
in
herself
was
another
standard
of
forgiveness
she
could
never
condemn
for
the
simple
reason
that
she
herself
had
failed
in
every
sense
of
the
word
unresentfully
she
was
able
to
sum
it
all
up
as
it
were
when
she
told
herself
people
who
would
have
resisted
temptation
themselves
understand
those
who
fall
so
they
ca
really
forgive
but
the
bad
ones
who
know
that
they
have
given
way
all
along
the
line
know
that
any
temptation
would
have
been
too
strong
for
them
it
only
chance
whether
it
comes
their
way
or
not
so
they
can
understand
she
felt
oddly
contented
as
at
having
reached
a
solution
later
on
her
thoughts
turned
to
the
past
again
and
to
the
childish
days
when
she
had
been
the
leading
spirit
in
the
clevedon
square
nursery
but
the
memory
of
that
past
incredible
security
and
assurance
made
her
begin
to
cry
and
she
wiped
away
blinding
tears
and
told
herself
that
she
must
not
give
way
to
them
she
did
not
at
first
quite
know
why
she
must
reserve
the
tiny
modicum
of
strength
still
left
her
but
presently
she
realized
that
the
end
which
had
become
inevitable
could
not
be
reached
without
decisive
action
of
her
own
alex
logic
was
elementary
and
its
directness
left
her
no
loophole
for
doubt
she
could
endure
the
plane
of
existence
on
which
she
found
herself
no
longer
if
she
fled
in
search
of
other
conditions
it
was
with
full
certainty
that
these
could
not
be
less
tolerable
than
those
from
which
she
was
flying
and
at
the
back
of
her
mind
was
a
strange
growing
hope
that
perhaps
that
forgiveness
of
which
her
mind
was
full
might
be
found
beyond
the
veil
after
all
thought
alex
it
even
chances
if
religion
is
all
true
then
i
go
to
hell
whether
i
kill
myself
or
not
and
if
it
is
then
perhaps
i
shall
just
go
out
and
know
nothing
more
ever
or
perhaps
it
will
be
really
a
new
beginning
and
there
will
be
somebody
or
something
who
will
forgive
me
and
let
me
start
over
again
she
began
to
feel
rather
excited
as
though
she
were
about
to
try
an
experiment
that
might
best
be
described
as
a
gamble
hoxton
coming
in
with
the
small
looked
at
her
sharply
two
or
three
times
and
when
she
had
gone
away
again
alex
turning
to
the
glass
saw
that
her
eyes
were
shining
and
looking
enormously
large
and
i
believe
i
am
happy
tonight
she
thought
wonderingly
while
she
ate
her
supper
she
tried
to
make
a
plan
but
the
excitement
within
her
was
growing
steadily
and
she
could
only
think
out
eager
for
her
own
decision
it
wo
hurt
any
one
else
nobody
will
mind
in
fact
when
they
got
over
the
first
shock
it
will
be
a
relief
to
them
all
they
been
very
kind
violet
and
cedric
violet
most
of
all
but
they
understood
they
have
understood
better
if
i
been
a
bad
woman
lived
with
wicked
men
or
things
like
that
i
suppose
i
should
have
done
that
too
if
it
had
come
my
way
but
then
i
never
had
the
temptation
i
had
only
little
mean
horrible
temptations
and
i
did
resist
any
of
them
the
other
sort
of
sin
would
have
made
me
happier
it
would
have
meant
a
sort
of
success
in
a
way
but
i
have
been
a
failure
at
everything
always
her
heart
hammering
against
her
side
alex
resolved
that
in
this
her
last
disgrace
she
would
not
fail
making
no
preparations
no
written
farewells
she
rose
presently
and
went
to
her
room
where
she
put
on
her
thickest
coat
and
tied
a
woollen
scarf
over
her
head
then
she
went
out
it
had
stopped
raining
and
the
air
was
soft
and
moist
it
was
a
starless
night
and
when
alex
got
to
the
heath
and
away
from
the
lighted
streets
it
was
very
dark
underneath
her
sense
of
adventure
she
was
conscious
of
terror
sheer
physical
terror
and
also
of
the
deeper
dread
that
her
resolution
might
fail
her
i
must
i
must
she
kept
on
muttering
to
herself
then
as
though
reassuring
somebody
else
but
it
only
like
going
for
a
journey
to
a
quite
new
place
where
everything
may
be
different
and
much
much
better
or
else
to
sleep
and
never
any
waking
up
to
misery
again
just
one
dreadful
minute
or
two
perhaps
and
then
it
will
all
be
over
only
a
question
of
a
little
physical
courage
not
to
struggle
like
taking
gas
much
easier
if
one
struggle
she
was
struck
by
a
sudden
thought
and
said
aloud
triumphantly
as
though
she
were
defeating
by
her
inspiration
some
one
who
was
urging
difficulties
upon
her
i
wo
give
myself
any
chances
i
put
big
stones
in
my
pocket
and
tie
my
scarf
over
my
mouth
that
make
it
quicker
too
when
she
came
to
the
part
of
the
heath
where
the
water
lay
alex
began
to
stoop
down
and
hunt
for
stones
she
pounced
on
each
one
that
seemed
larger
than
its
fellows
with
a
sense
of
pride
at
her
own
success
and
put
them
into
the
pockets
of
her
coat
the
moon
appeared
palely
through
clouds
and
then
disappeared
again
but
not
before
she
had
taken
her
bearings
she
was
on
one
of
the
many
wide
bridges
that
span
the
long
pools
dotted
over
the
heath
pools
shelving
at
the
sides
with
an
effect
of
shallowness
and
deepening
suddenly
in
the
middle
alex
threw
an
indifferent
glance
at
the
dark
water
and
only
felt
annoyance
that
so
few
stones
should
be
loose
upon
the
pathway
and
none
of
them
very
large
ones
when
her
pockets
were
filled
she
did
not
think
the
weight
very
noticeable
then
came
another
evanescent
gleam
of
moonlight
and
alex
still
with
that
sharpening
of
all
her
perceptions
noticed
that
there
was
a
figure
at
the
far
end
of
the
bridge
he
appeared
to
be
stationary
leaning
on
the
parapet
and
gazing
down
at
the
almost
invisible
pond
she
was
conscious
of
vexation
his
presence
would
surely
interfere
with
her
scheme
for
a
moment
she
wondered
detachedly
enough
whether
she
should
go
away
and
come
back
the
following
evening
but
the
next
instant
she
recoiled
from
the
thought
as
though
seeing
in
it
the
promptings
of
her
own
weakness
i
am
not
frightened
tonight
at
least
hardly
at
all
if
i
wait
i
may
never
feel
like
this
again
i
shall
make
a
failure
of
it
all
and
that
would
be
worse
than
anything
i
must
do
it
tonight
while
i
not
frightened
she
was
not
cold
walking
in
her
heavy
coat
had
warmed
her
and
the
evening
was
mild
as
well
as
damp
so
she
waited
quietly
in
the
shadow
hoping
that
the
man
would
presently
move
away
the
thought
crossed
her
mind
with
a
certain
humour
that
the
situation
held
possibilities
of
romance
if
it
were
in
a
book
he
would
save
me
at
the
last
minute
and
fall
in
love
with
me
and
it
would
all
end
happily
or
he
would
see
me
now
and
perhaps
speak
to
me
and
he
would
understand
all
i
told
him
and
persuade
me
not
to
anyhow
it
would
all
come
right
she
smiled
in
the
darkness
but
that
wo
happen
to
there
never
was
any
one
and
nobody
would
love
me
now
especially
when
they
knew
all
about
me
she
remembered
the
haggard
distorted
countenance
that
the
had
shown
her
the
great
starting
eyes
with
discoloured
circles
beneath
them
and
the
blackened
prominent
teeth
more
salient
than
ever
from
the
thinness
of
her
face
she
could
almost
have
laughed
without
any
conscious
bitterness
at
the
idea
of
any
romance
in
connection
with
her
present
self
and
yet
the
girl
alex
clare
could
have
loved
had
looked
forward
to
love
and
to
happiness
as
her
rights
just
as
pamela
clare
did
now
but
pamela
was
different
every
one
was
no
it
was
alex
that
was
different
that
had
always
been
different
she
began
to
feel
less
warm
and
shivered
a
little
as
she
waited
it
occurred
to
her
not
with
any
sense
of
fear
but
with
vexation
that
her
purpose
would
be
far
more
difficult
of
achievement
if
she
waited
until
she
was
physically
chilled
she
looked
up
at
the
bridge
again
and
the
figure
was
still
there
at
the
furthest
end
alex
measured
the
length
of
the
bridge
with
her
eyes
it
was
doubtful
if
he
would
see
her
from
the
furthest
end
of
it
but
she
reflected
if
i
jump
there
will
be
the
noise
of
a
splash
and
he
might
do
something
he
would
try
to
save
me
i
suppose
or
run
for
help
it
would
be
safe
if
he
would
go
she
became
irritated
with
a
sense
of
despair
she
determined
to
circumvent
the
motionless
watchful
figure
moving
very
quietly
and
almost
soundlessly
over
the
soft
muddy
ground
alex
made
her
way
from
the
path
to
the
bank
and
further
and
further
down
it
till
only
a
short
declivity
of
shelving
mud
lay
between
her
and
the
water
she
could
feel
the
brambles
catching
in
her
thick
coat
as
though
pulling
her
back
but
she
went
on
cautiously
and
steadily
once
or
twice
she
pushed
at
the
low
tangled
bushes
that
impeded
her
progress
and
paused
aghast
at
the
rustling
that
ensued
but
from
the
bridge
above
her
there
came
no
sound
within
a
few
steps
of
the
dark
water
her
feet
already
sinking
into
the
wet
spongy
ground
she
stopped
she
realized
with
wondering
joy
that
after
all
she
was
not
very
much
afraid
it
was
as
though
the
which
had
for
so
long
deserted
her
had
come
back
now
to
carry
her
through
the
last
need
she
felt
proud
because
she
knew
that
for
this
once
she
was
not
going
to
fail
she
talked
to
herself
in
a
whisper
this
one
time
just
a
few
minutes
when
it
may
be
very
bad
but
remember
that
it
ca
last
long
and
then
it
all
be
over
and
perhaps
there
never
be
anything
more
afterwards
like
being
always
asleep
and
no
one
need
be
vexed
or
disappointed
any
more
but
perhaps
she
paused
on
the
thought
and
her
heart
began
to
beat
faster
with
a
hopeful
excitement
such
as
she
had
not
known
for
a
very
long
while
perhaps
it
will
be
much
better
than
one
imagines
possible
perhaps
there
be
real
forgiveness
and
understanding
and
then
my
having
done
this
wo
matter
anyway
i
shall
know
very
soon
if
only
i
brave
just
for
a
few
minutes
she
drew
a
long
breath
then
instinctively
stretching
her
arms
straight
out
before
her
so
as
to
balance
herself
she
began
to
move
forward
the
first
unmistakable
touch
of
the
water
round
her
feet
made
her
gasp
and
stifle
a
scream
but
she
waded
on
encouraging
herself
in
a
low
murmur
as
though
speaking
to
a
child
it
only
like
going
into
the
sea
when
one
bathing
pretend
that
then
you
wo
be
frightened
just
straight
on
it
will
be
over
quite
soon
she
was
moving
slowly
but
without
pause
her
hands
held
out
in
front
of
her
the
ground
still
beneath
her
slipping
feet
which
felt
oddly
weighted
once
she
began
to
pull
the
woollen
scarf
over
her
mouth
but
with
the
sense
of
breathlessness
came
the
beginning
of
panic
and
she
tore
it
away
again
go
on
coward
coward
she
urged
herself
remember
what
it
would
mean
to
make
another
muddle
of
this
and
to
fail
the
cold
invaded
her
body
and
her
teeth
began
to
chatter
for
an
instant
she
stood
surrounded
by
the
silent
water
cold
and
terror
and
the
weight
of
her
now
sodden
clothing
paralysing
her
so
that
she
could
move
neither
backwards
to
the
shore
nor
forward
into
the
blackness
in
front
of
her
i
must
muttered
alex
and
wrenched
one
foot
desperately
out
of
the
mud
below
with
the
forward
movement
she
lost
her
balance
and
her
hands
clutched
instinctively
at
the
water
level
then
the
clogging
bottom
of
the
pond
sheered
away
suddenly
from
beneath
her
and
there
was
only
water
dark
and
icy
and
rushing
above
and
below
and
all
round
her

epitaph
they
sat
round
afterwards
in
the
clevedon
square
all
the
people
who
had
helped
misguided
erring
alex
according
to
their
lights
or
again
according
to
their
limitations
and
who
had
failed
her
so
completely
in
the
ultimate
essential
pamela
and
her
lover
whispered
together
in
the
window
after
all
you
know
hesitated
the
girl
she
had
nothing
much
to
live
for
poor
alex
she
got
out
of
touch
with
all
of
us
and
she
had
no
one
of
her
very
own
not
like
us
his
hand
closed
for
an
instant
over
hers
there
was
no
reason
why
she
should
not
have
come
to
us
if
if
she
was
in
money
difficulties
reiterated
cedric
uneasily
he
consciously
refrained
from
adding
again
violet

crying
softly
lying
back
in
the
depths
of
a

oh
poor

nicer

violet
said
archie
gruffly
she
was
awfully
fond
of
you

she
and
of
the
little
kid
barbara
hard
and
gazed
round
the
familiar
room
for
a
moment
it
seemed
to
her
that
they
were
all
children
again
sent
down
from
the
nursery
by
old
nurse
on
lady
isabel
at
home
afternoon
her
eyes
met
those
of
cedric
who
had
taken
up
his
stand
against
the
mantelpiece
in
his
hand
his
glasses
which
he
was
shaking
with
little
judicial
jerks
oh
cedric
said
barbara
with
a
sudden
catch
in
her
voice
do
you
remember
alex
was
such
