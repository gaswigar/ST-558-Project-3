chapter
the
psammead
there
were
once
four
children
who
spent
their
summer
holidays
in
a
white
house
happily
situated
between
a
sandpit
and
a
chalkpit
one
day
they
had
the
good
fortune
to
find
in
the
sandpit
a
strange
creature
its
eyes
were
on
long
horns
like
snail
s
eyes
and
it
could
move
them
in
and
out
like
telescopes
it
had
ears
like
a
bat
s
ears
and
its
tubby
body
was
shaped
like
a
spider
s
and
covered
with
thick
soft
fur
and
it
had
hands
and
feet
like
a
monkey
s
it
told
the
children
whose
names
were
cyril
robert
anthea
and
jane
that
it
was
a
psammead
or
psammead
is
pronounced
it
was
old
old
old
and
its
birthday
was
almost
at
the
very
beginning
of
everything
and
it
had
been
buried
in
the
sand
for
thousands
of
years
but
it
still
kept
its
fairylikeness
and
part
of
this
fairylikeness
was
its
power
to
give
people
whatever
they
wished
for
you
know
fairies
have
always
been
able
to
do
this
cyril
robert
anthea
and
jane
now
found
their
wishes
come
true
but
somehow
they
never
could
think
of
just
the
right
things
to
wish
for
and
their
wishes
sometimes
turned
out
very
oddly
indeed
in
the
end
their
unwise
wishings
landed
them
in
what
robert
called
a
very
tight
place
indeed
and
the
psammead
consented
to
help
them
out
of
it
in
return
for
their
promise
never
never
to
ask
it
to
grant
them
any
more
wishes
and
never
to
tell
anyone
about
it
because
it
did
not
want
to
be
bothered
to
give
wishes
to
anyone
ever
any
more
at
the
moment
of
parting
jane
said
politely
i
wish
we
were
going
to
see
you
again
some
and
the
psammead
touched
by
this
friendly
thought
granted
the
wish
the
book
about
all
this
is
called
five
children
and
it
and
it
ends
up
in
a
most
tiresome
way
by
saying
the
children
did
see
the
psammead
again
but
it
was
not
in
the
sandpit
it
was
but
i
must
say
no
more
the
reason
that
nothing
more
could
be
said
was
that
i
had
not
then
been
able
to
find
out
exactly
when
and
where
the
children
met
the
psammead
again
of
course
i
knew
they
would
meet
it
because
it
was
a
beast
of
its
word
and
when
it
said
a
thing
would
happen
that
thing
happened
without
fail
how
different
from
the
people
who
tell
us
about
what
weather
it
is
going
to
be
on
thursday
next
in
london
the
south
coast
and
channel
the
summer
holidays
during
which
the
psammead
had
been
found
and
the
wishes
given
had
been
wonderful
holidays
in
the
country
and
the
children
had
the
highest
hopes
of
just
such
another
holiday
for
the
next
summer
the
winter
holidays
were
beguiled
by
the
wonderful
happenings
of
the
phoenix
and
the
carpet
and
the
loss
of
these
two
treasures
would
have
left
the
children
in
despair
but
for
the
splendid
hope
of
their
next
holiday
in
the
country
the
world
they
felt
and
indeed
had
some
reason
to
feel
was
full
of
wonderful
things
and
they
were
really
the
sort
of
people
that
wonderful
things
happen
to
so
they
looked
forward
to
the
summer
holiday
but
when
it
came
everything
was
different
and
very
very
horrid
father
had
to
go
out
to
manchuria
to
telegraph
news
about
the
war
to
the
tiresome
paper
he
wrote
for
the
daily
bellower
or
something
like
that
was
its
name
and
mother
poor
dear
mother
was
away
in
madeira
because
she
had
been
very
and
the
lamb
i
mean
the
baby
was
with
her
and
aunt
emma
who
was
mother
s
sister
had
suddenly
married
uncle
reginald
who
was
father
s
brother
and
they
had
gone
to
china
which
is
much
too
far
off
for
you
to
expect
to
be
asked
to
spend
the
holidays
in
however
fond
your
aunt
and
uncle
may
be
of
you
so
the
children
were
left
in
the
care
of
old
nurse
who
lived
in
fitzroy
street
near
the
british
museum
and
though
she
was
always
very
kind
to
them
and
indeed
spoiled
them
far
more
than
would
be
good
for
the
most
of
us
the
four
children
felt
perfectly
wretched
and
when
the
cab
had
driven
off
with
father
and
all
his
boxes
and
guns
and
the
sheepskin
with
blankets
and
the
aluminium
inside
it
the
stoutest
heart
quailed
and
the
girls
broke
down
altogether
and
sobbed
in
each
other
s
arms
while
the
boys
each
looked
out
of
one
of
the
long
gloomy
windows
of
the
parlour
and
tried
to
pretend
that
no
boy
would
be
such
a
muff
as
to
cry
i
hope
you
notice
that
they
were
not
cowardly
enough
to
cry
till
their
father
had
gone
they
knew
he
had
quite
enough
to
upset
him
without
that
but
when
he
was
gone
everyone
felt
as
if
it
had
been
trying
not
to
cry
all
its
life
and
that
it
must
cry
now
if
it
died
for
it
so
they
cried
tea
with
shrimps
and
watercress
cheered
them
a
little
the
watercress
was
arranged
in
a
hedge
round
a
fat
glass
a
tasteful
device
they
had
never
seen
before
but
it
was
not
a
cheerful
meal
after
tea
anthea
went
up
to
the
room
that
had
been
father
s
and
when
she
saw
how
dreadfully
he
wasn
t
there
and
remembered
how
every
minute
was
taking
him
further
and
further
from
her
and
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
guns
of
the
russians
she
cried
a
little
more
then
she
thought
of
mother
ill
and
alone
and
perhaps
at
that
very
moment
wanting
a
little
girl
to
put
on
her
head
and
make
her
sudden
cups
of
tea
and
she
cried
more
than
ever
and
then
she
remembered
what
mother
had
said
the
night
before
she
went
away
about
anthea
being
the
eldest
girl
and
about
trying
to
make
the
others
happy
and
things
like
that
so
she
stopped
crying
and
thought
instead
and
when
she
had
thought
as
long
as
she
could
bear
she
washed
her
face
and
combed
her
hair
and
went
down
to
the
others
trying
her
best
to
look
as
though
crying
were
an
exercise
she
had
never
even
heard
of
she
found
the
parlour
in
deepest
gloom
hardly
relieved
at
all
by
the
efforts
of
robert
who
to
make
the
time
pass
was
pulling
jane
s
hair
not
hard
but
just
enough
to
tease
look
here
said
anthea
let
s
have
a
this
word
dated
from
the
awful
day
when
cyril
had
carelessly
wished
that
there
were
red
indians
in
england
and
there
had
been
the
word
brought
back
memories
of
last
summer
holidays
and
everyone
groaned
they
thought
of
the
white
house
with
the
beautiful
tangled
garden
late
roses
asters
marigold
sweet
mignonette
and
feathery
asparagus
of
the
wilderness
which
someone
had
once
meant
to
make
into
an
orchard
but
which
was
now
as
father
said
five
acres
of
thistles
haunted
by
the
ghosts
of
baby
they
thought
of
the
view
across
the
valley
where
the
looked
like
aladdin
s
palaces
in
the
sunshine
and
they
thought
of
their
own
sandpit
with
its
fringe
of
yellowy
grasses
and
wild
flowers
and
the
little
holes
in
the
cliff
that
were
the
little
little
front
doors
and
they
thought
of
the
free
fresh
air
smelling
of
thyme
and
sweetbriar
and
the
scent
of
the
from
the
cottages
in
the
lane
and
they
looked
round
old
nurse
s
stuffy
parlour
and
jane
said
oh
how
different
it
all
is
it
was
old
nurse
had
been
in
the
habit
of
letting
lodgings
till
father
gave
her
the
children
to
take
care
of
and
her
rooms
were
furnished
for
letting
now
it
is
a
very
odd
thing
that
no
one
ever
seems
to
furnish
a
room
for
letting
in
a
bit
the
same
way
as
one
would
furnish
it
for
living
in
this
room
had
heavy
dark
red
stuff
curtains
the
colour
that
blood
would
not
make
a
stain
on
with
coarse
lace
curtains
inside
the
carpet
was
yellow
and
violet
with
bits
of
grey
and
brown
oilcloth
in
odd
places
the
fireplace
had
shavings
and
tinsel
in
it
there
was
a
very
varnished
mahogany
chiffonier
or
sideboard
with
a
lock
that
wouldn
t
act
there
were
hard
chairs
far
too
many
of
them
with
crochet
antimacassars
slipping
off
their
seats
all
of
which
sloped
the
wrong
way
the
table
wore
a
cloth
of
a
cruel
green
colour
with
a
yellow
pattern
round
it
over
the
fireplace
was
a
that
made
you
look
much
uglier
than
you
really
were
however
plain
you
might
be
to
begin
with
then
there
was
a
mantelboard
with
maroon
plush
and
wool
fringe
that
did
not
match
the
plush
a
dreary
clock
like
a
black
marble
tomb
it
was
silent
as
the
grave
too
for
it
had
long
since
forgotten
how
to
tick
and
there
were
painted
glass
vases
that
never
had
any
flowers
in
and
a
painted
tambourine
that
no
one
ever
played
and
painted
brackets
with
nothing
on
them
and
engravings
of
the
queen
the
houses
of
parliament
the
plains
of
heaven
and
of
a
woodman
s
flat
there
were
two
books
last
december
s
bradshaw
and
an
odd
volume
of
plumridge
s
commentary
on
thessalonians
there
were
but
i
can
not
dwell
longer
on
this
painful
picture
it
was
indeed
as
jane
said
very
different
let
s
have
a
palaver
said
anthea
again
what
about
said
cyril
yawning
there
s
nothing
to
have
anything
about
said
robert
kicking
the
leg
of
the
table
miserably
i
don
t
want
to
play
said
jane
and
her
tone
was
grumpy
anthea
tried
very
hard
not
to
be
cross
she
succeeded
look
here
she
said
don
t
think
i
want
to
be
preachy
or
a
beast
in
any
way
but
i
want
to
what
father
calls
define
the
situation
do
you
agree
fire
ahead
said
cyril
without
enthusiasm
well
then
we
all
know
the
reason
we
re
staying
here
is
because
nurse
couldn
t
leave
her
house
on
account
of
the
poor
learned
gentleman
on
the
and
there
was
no
one
else
father
could
entrust
to
take
care
of
us
and
you
know
it
s
taken
a
lot
of
money
mother
s
going
to
madeira
to
be
made
jane
sniffed
miserably
yes
i
know
said
anthea
in
a
hurry
but
don
t
let
s
think
about
how
horrid
it
all
is
i
mean
we
can
t
go
to
things
that
cost
a
lot
but
we
must
do
something
and
i
know
there
are
heaps
of
things
you
can
see
in
london
without
paying
for
them
and
i
thought
we
d
go
and
see
them
we
are
all
quite
old
now
and
we
haven
t
got
the
lamb
jane
sniffed
harder
than
before
i
mean
no
one
can
say
no
because
of
him
dear
pet
and
i
thought
we
must
get
nurse
to
see
how
quite
old
we
are
and
let
us
go
out
by
ourselves
or
else
we
shall
never
have
any
sort
of
a
time
at
all
and
i
vote
we
see
everything
there
is
and
let
s
begin
by
asking
nurse
to
give
us
some
bits
of
bread
and
we
ll
go
to
st
james
s
park
there
are
ducks
there
i
know
we
can
feed
them
only
we
must
make
nurse
let
us
go
by
hurrah
for
liberty
said
robert
but
she
won
yes
she
will
said
jane
unexpectedly
thought
about
that
this
morning
and
i
asked
father
and
he
said
yes
and
what
s
more
he
told
old
nurse
we
might
only
he
said
we
must
always
say
where
we
wanted
to
go
and
if
it
was
right
she
would
let
three
cheers
for
thoughtful
jane
cried
cyril
now
roused
at
last
from
his
yawning
despair
i
say
let
s
go
so
they
went
old
nurse
only
begging
them
to
be
careful
of
crossings
and
to
ask
a
policeman
to
assist
in
the
more
difficult
cases
but
they
were
used
to
crossings
for
they
had
lived
in
camden
town
and
knew
the
kentish
town
road
where
the
trams
rush
up
and
down
like
mad
at
all
hours
of
the
day
and
night
and
seem
as
though
if
anything
they
would
rather
run
over
you
than
not
they
had
promised
to
be
home
by
dark
but
it
was
july
so
dark
would
be
very
late
indeed
and
long
past
bedtime
they
started
to
walk
to
st
james
s
park
and
all
their
pockets
were
stuffed
with
bits
of
bread
and
the
crusts
of
toast
to
feed
the
ducks
with
they
started
i
repeat
but
they
never
got
there
between
fitzroy
street
and
st
james
s
park
there
are
a
great
many
streets
and
if
you
go
the
right
way
you
will
pass
a
great
many
shops
that
you
can
not
possibly
help
stopping
to
look
at
the
children
stopped
to
look
at
several
with
and
beads
and
pictures
and
jewellery
and
dresses
and
hats
and
oysters
and
lobsters
in
their
windows
and
their
sorrow
did
not
seem
nearly
so
impossible
to
bear
as
it
had
done
in
the
best
parlour
at
no
fitzroy
street
presently
by
some
wonderful
chance
turn
of
robert
s
who
had
been
voted
captain
because
the
girls
thought
it
would
be
good
for
him
and
indeed
he
thought
so
himself
and
of
course
cyril
couldn
t
vote
against
him
because
it
would
have
looked
like
a
mean
jealousy
they
came
into
the
little
interesting
streets
that
held
the
most
interesting
shops
of
all
the
shops
where
live
things
were
sold
there
was
one
shop
window
entirely
filled
with
cages
and
all
sorts
of
beautiful
birds
in
them
the
children
were
delighted
till
they
remembered
how
they
had
once
wished
for
wings
themselves
and
had
had
them
and
then
they
felt
how
desperately
unhappy
anything
with
wings
must
be
if
it
is
shut
up
in
a
cage
and
not
allowed
to
fly
it
must
be
fairly
beastly
to
be
a
bird
in
a
cage
said
cyril
come
on
they
went
on
and
cyril
tried
to
think
out
a
scheme
for
making
his
fortune
as
a
at
klondyke
and
then
buying
all
the
caged
birds
in
the
world
and
setting
them
free
then
they
came
to
a
shop
that
sold
cats
but
the
cats
were
in
cages
and
the
children
could
not
help
wishing
someone
would
buy
all
the
cats
and
put
them
on
hearthrugs
which
are
the
proper
places
for
cats
and
there
was
the
and
that
was
not
a
happy
thing
to
look
at
either
because
all
the
dogs
were
chained
or
caged
and
all
the
dogs
big
and
little
looked
at
the
four
children
with
sad
wistful
eyes
and
wagged
beseeching
tails
as
if
they
were
trying
to
say
buy
me
buy
me
buy
me
and
let
me
go
for
a
walk
with
you
oh
do
buy
me
and
buy
my
poor
brothers
too
do
do
do
they
almost
said
do
do
do
plain
to
the
ear
as
they
whined
all
but
one
big
irish
terrier
and
he
growled
when
jane
patted
him
grrrrr
he
seemed
to
say
as
he
looked
at
them
from
the
back
corner
of
his
eye
you
won
t
buy
me
nobody
will
ever
i
shall
die
chained
up
and
i
don
t
know
that
i
care
how
soon
it
is
either
i
don
t
know
that
the
children
would
have
understood
all
this
only
once
they
had
been
in
a
besieged
castle
so
they
knew
how
hateful
it
is
to
be
kept
in
when
you
want
to
get
out
of
course
they
could
not
buy
any
of
the
dogs
they
did
indeed
ask
the
price
of
the
very
very
smallest
and
it
was
pounds
but
that
was
because
it
was
a
japanese
toy
spaniel
like
the
queen
once
had
her
portrait
painted
with
when
she
was
only
princess
of
wales
but
the
children
thought
if
the
smallest
was
all
that
money
the
biggest
would
run
into
thousands
so
they
went
on
and
they
did
not
stop
at
any
more
cat
or
dog
or
bird
shops
but
passed
them
by
and
at
last
they
came
to
a
shop
that
seemed
as
though
it
only
sold
creatures
that
did
not
much
mind
where
they
were
such
as
goldfish
and
white
mice
and
and
other
aquarium
beasts
and
lizards
and
toads
and
hedgehogs
and
tortoises
and
tame
rabbits
and
and
there
they
stopped
for
a
long
time
and
fed
the
with
bits
of
bread
through
the
and
wondered
whether
it
would
be
possible
to
keep
a
in
the
basement
of
the
house
in
fitzroy
street
i
don
t
suppose
old
nurse
would
mind
very
much
said
jane
rabbits
are
most
awfully
tame
sometimes
i
expect
it
would
know
her
voice
and
follow
her
all
she
d
tumble
over
it
twenty
times
a
day
said
cyril
now
a
snake
there
aren
t
any
snakes
said
robert
hastily
and
besides
i
never
could
cotton
to
snakes
somehow
i
wonder
worms
are
as
bad
said
anthea
and
eels
and
slugs
i
think
it
s
because
we
don
t
like
things
that
haven
t
got
father
says
snakes
have
got
legs
hidden
away
inside
of
them
said
robert
yes
and
he
says
we
ve
got
tails
hidden
away
inside
us
but
it
doesn
t
either
of
it
come
to
anything
really
said
anthea
i
hate
things
that
haven
t
any
it
s
worse
when
they
have
too
many
said
jane
with
a
shudder
think
of
centipedes
they
stood
there
on
the
pavement
a
cause
of
some
inconvenience
to
the
passersby
and
thus
beguiled
the
time
with
conversation
cyril
was
leaning
his
elbow
on
the
top
of
a
hutch
that
had
seemed
empty
when
they
had
inspected
the
whole
edifice
of
hutches
one
by
one
and
he
was
trying
to
reawaken
the
interest
of
a
hedgehog
that
had
curled
itself
into
a
ball
earlier
in
the
interview
when
a
small
soft
voice
just
below
his
elbow
said
quietly
plainly
and
quite
unmistakably
not
in
any
squeak
or
whine
that
had
to
be
translated
but
in
downright
common
english
buy
me
do
please
buy
me
cyril
started
as
though
he
had
been
pinched
and
jumped
a
yard
away
from
the
hutch
come
back
oh
come
back
said
the
voice
rather
louder
but
still
softly
stoop
down
and
pretend
to
be
tying
up
your
bootlace
i
see
it
s
undone
as
cyril
mechanically
obeyed
he
knelt
on
one
knee
on
the
dry
hot
dusty
pavement
peered
into
the
darkness
of
the
hutch
and
found
himself
face
to
face
with
the
psammead
it
seemed
much
thinner
than
when
he
had
last
seen
it
it
was
dusty
and
dirty
and
its
fur
was
untidy
and
ragged
it
had
hunched
itself
up
into
a
miserable
lump
and
its
long
snail
s
eyes
were
drawn
in
quite
tight
so
that
they
hardly
showed
at
all
listen
said
the
psammead
in
a
voice
that
sounded
as
though
it
would
begin
to
cry
in
a
minute
i
don
t
think
the
creature
who
keeps
this
shop
will
ask
a
very
high
price
for
me
i
ve
bitten
him
more
than
once
and
i
ve
made
myself
look
as
common
as
i
can
he
s
never
had
a
glance
from
my
beautiful
beautiful
eyes
tell
the
others
i
m
here
but
tell
them
to
look
at
some
of
those
low
common
beasts
while
i
m
talking
to
you
the
creature
inside
mustn
t
think
you
care
much
about
me
or
he
ll
put
a
price
upon
me
far
far
beyond
your
means
i
remember
in
the
dear
old
days
last
summer
you
never
had
much
money
oh
i
never
thought
i
should
be
so
glad
to
see
you
i
never
it
sniffed
and
shot
out
its
long
snail
s
eyes
expressly
to
drop
a
tear
well
away
from
its
fur
tell
the
others
i
m
here
and
then
i
ll
tell
you
exactly
what
to
do
about
buying
cyril
tied
his
bootlace
into
a
hard
knot
stood
up
and
addressed
the
others
in
firm
tones
look
here
he
said
i
m
not
kidding
and
i
appeal
to
your
honour
an
appeal
which
in
this
family
was
never
made
in
vain
don
t
look
at
that
hutch
look
at
the
white
rat
now
you
are
not
to
look
at
that
hutch
whatever
i
he
stood
in
front
of
it
to
prevent
mistakes
now
get
yourselves
ready
for
a
great
surprise
in
that
hutch
there
s
an
old
friend
of
ours
don
t
look
yes
it
s
the
psammead
the
good
old
psammead
it
wants
us
to
buy
it
it
says
you
re
not
to
look
at
it
look
at
the
white
rat
and
count
your
money
on
your
honour
don
t
look
the
others
responded
nobly
they
looked
at
the
white
rat
till
they
quite
stared
him
out
of
countenance
so
that
he
went
and
sat
up
on
his
hind
legs
in
a
far
corner
and
hid
his
eyes
with
his
front
paws
and
pretended
he
was
washing
his
face
cyril
stooped
again
busying
himself
with
the
other
bootlace
and
listened
for
the
psammead
s
further
instructions
go
in
said
the
psammead
and
ask
the
price
of
lots
of
other
things
then
say
what
do
you
want
for
that
monkey
that
s
lost
its
tail
the
mangy
old
thing
in
the
third
hutch
from
the
oh
don
t
mind
my
feelings
call
me
a
mangy
monkey
i
ve
tried
hard
enough
to
look
like
one
i
don
t
think
he
ll
put
a
high
price
on
me
i
ve
bitten
him
eleven
times
since
i
came
here
the
day
before
yesterday
if
he
names
a
bigger
price
than
you
can
afford
say
you
wish
you
had
the
but
you
can
t
give
us
wishes
i
ve
promised
never
to
have
another
wish
from
you
said
the
bewildered
cyril
don
t
be
a
silly
little
idiot
said
the
in
trembling
but
affectionate
tones
but
find
out
how
much
money
you
ve
got
between
you
and
do
exactly
what
i
tell
cyril
pointing
a
stiff
and
unmeaning
finger
at
the
white
rat
so
as
to
pretend
that
its
charms
alone
employed
his
tongue
explained
matters
to
the
others
while
the
psammead
hunched
itself
and
bunched
itself
and
did
its
very
best
to
make
itself
look
uninteresting
then
the
four
children
filed
into
the
shop
how
much
do
you
want
for
that
white
rat
asked
cyril
eightpence
was
the
answer
and
the
eighteenpence
to
five
bob
according
to
the
and
the
lizards
ninepence
and
toads
fourpence
now
look
here
said
the
greasy
owner
of
all
this
caged
life
with
a
sudden
ferocity
which
made
the
whole
party
back
hurriedly
on
to
the
wainscoting
of
hutches
with
which
the
shop
was
lined
lookee
here
i
ain
t
agoin
to
have
you
a
comin
in
here
a
turnin
the
whole
place
outer
winder
an
prizing
every
animile
in
the
stock
just
for
your
larks
so
don
t
think
it
if
you
re
a
buyer
be
a
buyer
but
i
never
had
a
customer
yet
as
wanted
to
buy
mice
and
lizards
and
toads
and
guineas
all
at
once
so
hout
you
oh
wait
a
minute
said
the
wretched
cyril
feeling
how
foolishly
yet
he
had
carried
out
the
psammead
s
instructions
just
tell
me
one
thing
what
do
you
want
for
the
mangy
old
monkey
in
the
third
hutch
from
the
end
the
shopman
only
saw
in
this
a
new
insult
mangy
young
monkey
yourself
said
he
get
along
with
your
blooming
cheek
hout
you
goes
oh
don
t
be
so
cross
said
jane
losing
her
head
altogether
don
t
you
see
he
really
does
want
to
know
that
ho
does
e
indeed
sneered
the
merchant
then
he
scratched
his
ear
suspiciously
for
he
was
a
sharp
business
man
and
he
knew
the
ring
of
truth
when
he
heard
it
his
hand
was
bandaged
and
three
minutes
before
he
would
have
been
glad
to
sell
the
mangy
old
monkey
for
ten
shillings
now
ho
e
does
does
e
he
said
then
two
pun
ten
s
my
price
he
s
not
got
his
fellow
that
monkey
ain
t
nor
yet
his
match
not
this
side
of
the
equator
which
he
comes
from
and
the
only
one
ever
seen
in
london
ought
to
be
in
the
zoo
two
pun
ten
down
on
the
nail
or
hout
you
goes
the
children
looked
at
each
other
shillings
and
fivepence
was
all
they
had
in
the
world
and
it
would
have
been
merely
three
and
fivepence
but
for
the
sovereign
which
father
had
given
to
them
between
them
at
parting
we
ve
only
shillings
and
fivepence
said
cyril
rattling
the
money
in
his
pocket
farthings
and
somebody
s
own
cheek
said
the
dealer
for
he
did
not
believe
that
cyril
had
so
much
money
there
was
a
miserable
pause
then
anthea
remembered
and
said
oh
i
wish
i
had
two
pounds
so
do
i
miss
i
m
sure
said
the
man
with
bitter
politeness
i
wish
you
ad
i
m
sure
anthea
s
hand
was
on
the
counter
something
seemed
to
slide
under
it
she
lifted
it
there
lay
five
bright
half
sovereigns
why
i
have
got
it
after
all
she
said
here
s
the
money
now
let
s
have
the
sammy
the
monkey
i
the
dealer
looked
hard
at
the
money
but
he
made
haste
to
put
it
in
his
pocket
i
only
hope
you
come
by
it
honest
he
said
shrugging
his
shoulders
he
scratched
his
ear
again
well
he
said
i
suppose
i
must
let
you
have
it
but
it
s
worth
thribble
the
money
so
it
is
he
slowly
led
the
way
out
to
the
hutch
opened
the
door
gingerly
and
made
a
sudden
fierce
grab
at
the
psammead
which
the
psammead
acknowledged
in
one
last
long
lingering
bite
here
take
the
brute
said
the
shopman
squeezing
the
psammead
so
tight
that
he
nearly
choked
it
it
s
bit
me
to
the
marrow
it
the
man
s
eyes
opened
as
anthea
held
out
her
arms
don
t
blame
me
if
it
tears
your
face
off
its
bones
he
said
and
the
psammead
made
a
leap
from
his
dirty
horny
hands
and
anthea
caught
it
in
hers
which
were
not
very
clean
certainly
but
at
any
rate
were
soft
and
pink
and
held
it
kindly
and
closely
but
you
can
t
take
it
home
like
that
cyril
said
we
shall
have
a
crowd
after
us
and
indeed
two
errand
boys
and
a
policeman
had
already
collected
i
can
t
give
you
nothink
only
a
like
what
we
put
the
tortoises
in
said
the
man
grudgingly
so
the
whole
party
went
into
the
shop
and
the
shopman
s
eyes
nearly
came
out
of
his
head
when
having
given
anthea
the
largest
he
could
find
he
saw
her
hold
it
open
and
the
psammead
carefully
creep
into
it
well
he
said
if
that
there
don
t
beat
cockfighting
but
p
raps
you
ve
met
the
brute
yes
said
cyril
affably
he
s
an
old
friend
of
if
i
d
a
known
that
the
man
rejoined
you
shouldn
t
a
had
him
under
twice
the
money
owever
he
added
as
the
children
disappeared
i
ain
t
done
so
bad
seeing
as
i
only
give
five
bob
for
the
beast
but
then
there
s
the
bites
to
take
into
account
the
children
trembling
in
agitation
and
excitement
carried
home
the
psammead
trembling
in
its
when
they
got
it
home
anthea
nursed
it
and
stroked
it
and
would
have
cried
over
it
if
she
hadn
t
remembered
how
it
hated
to
be
wet
when
it
recovered
enough
to
speak
it
said
get
me
sand
silver
sand
from
the
oil
and
colour
shop
and
get
me
they
got
the
sand
and
they
put
it
and
the
psammead
in
the
round
bath
together
and
it
rubbed
itself
and
rolled
itself
and
shook
itself
and
scraped
itself
and
scratched
itself
and
preened
itself
till
it
felt
clean
and
comfy
and
then
it
scrabbled
a
hasty
hole
in
the
sand
and
went
to
sleep
in
it
the
children
hid
the
bath
under
the
girls
bed
and
had
supper
old
nurse
had
got
them
a
lovely
supper
of
bread
and
butter
and
fried
onions
she
was
full
of
kind
and
delicate
thoughts
when
anthea
woke
the
next
morning
the
psammead
was
snuggling
down
between
her
shoulder
and
jane
s
you
have
saved
my
life
it
said
i
know
that
man
would
have
thrown
cold
water
on
me
sooner
or
later
and
then
i
should
have
died
i
saw
him
wash
out
a
s
hutch
yesterday
morning
i
m
still
frightfully
sleepy
i
think
i
ll
go
back
to
sand
for
another
nap
wake
the
boys
and
this
dormouse
of
a
jane
and
when
you
ve
had
your
breakfasts
we
ll
have
a
don
t
you
want
any
breakfast
asked
anthea
i
daresay
i
shall
pick
a
bit
presently
it
said
but
sand
is
all
i
care
about
it
s
meat
and
drink
to
me
and
coals
and
fire
and
wife
and
with
these
words
it
clambered
down
by
the
bedclothes
and
scrambled
back
into
the
bath
where
they
heard
it
scratching
itself
out
of
sight
well
said
anthea
anyhow
our
holidays
won
t
be
dull
now
we
ve
found
the
psammead
no
said
jane
beginning
to
put
on
her
stockings
we
shan
t
be
dull
but
it
ll
be
only
like
having
a
pet
dog
now
it
can
t
give
us
oh
don
t
be
so
discontented
said
anthea
if
it
can
t
do
anything
else
it
can
tell
us
about
megatheriums
and
chapter
the
half
amulet
long
ago
that
is
to
say
last
summer
the
children
finding
themselves
embarrassed
by
some
wish
which
the
psammead
had
granted
them
and
which
the
servants
had
not
received
in
a
proper
spirit
had
wished
that
the
servants
might
not
notice
the
gifts
which
the
psammead
gave
and
when
they
parted
from
the
psammead
their
last
wish
had
been
that
they
should
meet
it
again
therefore
they
had
met
it
and
it
was
jolly
lucky
for
the
psammead
as
robert
pointed
out
now
of
course
you
see
that
the
psammead
s
being
where
it
was
was
the
consequence
of
one
of
their
wishes
and
therefore
was
a
and
as
such
could
not
be
noticed
by
the
servants
and
it
was
soon
plain
that
in
the
psammead
s
opinion
old
nurse
was
still
a
servant
although
she
had
now
a
house
of
her
own
for
she
never
noticed
the
psammead
at
all
and
that
was
as
well
for
she
would
never
have
consented
to
allow
the
girls
to
keep
an
animal
and
a
bath
of
sand
under
their
bed
when
breakfast
had
been
cleared
away
it
was
a
very
nice
breakfast
with
hot
rolls
to
it
a
luxury
quite
out
of
the
common
way
anthea
went
and
dragged
out
the
bath
and
woke
the
psammead
it
stretched
and
shook
itself
you
must
have
bolted
your
breakfast
most
unwholesomely
it
said
you
can
t
have
been
five
minutes
over
we
ve
been
nearly
an
hour
said
anthea
come
you
know
you
now
look
here
said
the
psammead
sitting
back
on
the
sand
and
shooting
out
its
long
eyes
suddenly
we
d
better
begin
as
we
mean
to
go
on
it
won
t
do
to
have
any
misunderstanding
so
i
tell
you
plainly
that
oh
please
anthea
pleaded
do
wait
till
we
get
to
the
others
they
ll
think
it
most
awfully
sneakish
of
me
to
talk
to
you
without
them
do
come
down
there
s
a
she
knelt
before
the
and
held
out
her
arms
the
psammead
must
have
remembered
how
glad
it
had
been
to
jump
into
those
same
little
arms
only
the
day
before
for
it
gave
a
little
grudging
grunt
and
jumped
once
more
anthea
wrapped
it
in
her
pinafore
and
carried
it
downstairs
it
was
welcomed
in
a
thrilling
silence
at
last
anthea
said
now
then
what
place
is
this
asked
the
psammead
shooting
its
eyes
out
and
turning
them
slowly
round
it
s
a
of
course
said
robert
then
i
don
t
like
it
said
the
psammead
never
mind
said
anthea
kindly
we
ll
take
you
anywhere
you
like
if
you
want
us
to
what
was
it
you
were
going
to
say
upstairs
when
i
said
the
others
wouldn
t
like
it
if
i
stayed
talking
to
you
without
them
it
looked
keenly
at
her
and
she
blushed
don
t
be
silly
it
said
sharply
of
course
it
s
quite
natural
that
you
should
like
your
brothers
and
sisters
to
know
exactly
how
good
and
unselfish
you
i
wish
you
wouldn
t
said
jane
anthea
was
quite
right
what
was
it
you
were
going
to
say
when
she
stopped
you
i
ll
tell
you
said
the
psammead
since
you
re
so
anxious
to
know
i
was
going
to
say
this
you
ve
saved
my
life
and
i
m
not
ungrateful
but
it
doesn
t
change
your
nature
or
mine
you
re
still
very
ignorant
and
rather
silly
and
i
am
worth
a
thousand
of
you
any
day
of
the
of
course
you
are
anthea
was
beginning
but
it
interrupted
her
it
s
very
rude
to
interrupt
it
said
what
i
mean
is
that
i
m
not
going
to
stand
any
nonsense
and
if
you
think
what
you
ve
done
is
to
give
you
the
right
to
pet
me
or
make
me
demean
myself
by
playing
with
you
you
ll
find
out
that
what
you
think
doesn
t
matter
a
single
penny
see
it
s
what
think
that
i
know
said
cyril
it
always
was
if
you
well
said
the
psammead
then
that
s
settled
we
re
to
be
treated
as
we
deserve
i
with
respect
and
all
of
you
with
but
i
don
t
wish
to
be
offensive
do
you
want
me
to
tell
you
how
i
got
into
that
horrible
den
you
bought
me
out
of
oh
i
m
not
ungrateful
i
haven
t
forgotten
it
and
i
shan
t
forget
do
tell
us
said
anthea
i
know
you
re
awfully
clever
but
even
with
all
your
cleverness
i
don
t
believe
you
can
possibly
know
how
how
respectfully
we
do
respect
you
don
t
we
the
others
all
said
yes
and
fidgeted
in
their
chairs
robert
spoke
the
wishes
of
all
when
he
said
i
do
wish
you
d
go
so
it
sat
up
on
the
table
and
went
on
when
you
d
gone
away
it
said
i
went
to
sand
for
a
bit
and
slept
i
was
tired
out
with
all
your
silly
wishes
and
i
felt
as
though
i
hadn
t
really
been
to
sand
for
a
to
sand
jane
repeated
where
i
sleep
you
go
to
bed
i
go
to
jane
yawned
the
mention
of
bed
made
her
feel
sleepy
all
right
said
the
psammead
in
offended
tones
i
m
sure
don
t
want
to
tell
you
a
long
tale
a
man
caught
me
and
i
bit
him
and
he
put
me
in
a
bag
with
a
dead
hare
and
a
dead
rabbit
and
he
took
me
to
his
house
and
put
me
out
of
the
bag
into
a
basket
with
holes
that
i
could
see
through
and
i
bit
him
again
and
then
he
brought
me
to
this
city
which
i
am
told
is
called
the
modern
babylon
though
it
s
not
a
bit
like
the
old
babylon
and
he
sold
me
to
the
man
you
bought
me
from
and
then
i
bit
them
both
now
what
s
your
news
there
s
not
quite
so
much
biting
in
our
story
said
cyril
regretfully
in
fact
there
isn
t
any
father
s
gone
to
manchuria
and
mother
and
the
lamb
have
gone
to
madeira
because
mother
was
ill
and
don
t
i
just
wish
that
they
were
both
safe
home
merely
from
habit
the
began
to
blow
itself
out
but
it
stopped
short
suddenly
i
forgot
it
said
i
can
t
give
you
any
more
no
but
look
here
said
cyril
couldn
t
we
call
in
old
nurse
and
get
her
to
say
she
wishes
they
were
safe
home
i
m
sure
she
no
go
said
the
psammead
it
s
just
the
same
as
your
wishing
yourself
if
you
get
some
one
else
to
wish
for
you
it
won
t
but
it
did
yesterday
with
the
man
in
the
shop
said
robert
ah
yes
said
the
creature
but
you
didn
t
ask
him
to
wish
and
you
didn
t
know
what
would
happen
if
he
did
that
can
t
be
done
again
it
s
played
then
you
can
t
help
us
at
all
said
jane
oh
i
did
think
you
could
do
something
i
ve
been
thinking
about
it
ever
since
we
saved
your
life
yesterday
i
thought
you
d
be
certain
to
be
able
to
fetch
back
father
even
if
you
couldn
t
manage
and
jane
began
to
cry
now
don
t
said
the
psammead
hastily
you
know
how
it
always
upsets
me
if
you
cry
i
can
t
feel
safe
a
moment
look
here
you
must
have
some
new
kind
of
that
s
easier
said
than
not
a
bit
of
it
said
the
creature
there
s
one
of
the
strongest
charms
in
the
world
not
a
stone
s
throw
from
where
you
bought
me
yesterday
the
man
that
i
bit
so
the
first
one
i
mean
went
into
a
shop
to
ask
how
much
something
cost
i
think
he
said
it
was
a
concertina
and
while
he
was
telling
the
man
in
the
shop
how
much
too
much
he
wanted
for
it
i
saw
the
charm
in
a
sort
of
tray
with
a
lot
of
other
things
if
you
can
only
buy
that
you
will
be
able
to
have
your
heart
s
the
children
looked
at
each
other
and
then
at
the
psammead
then
cyril
coughed
awkwardly
and
took
sudden
courage
to
say
what
everyone
was
thinking
i
do
hope
you
won
t
be
waxy
he
said
but
it
s
like
this
when
you
used
to
give
us
our
wishes
they
almost
always
got
us
into
some
row
or
other
and
we
used
to
think
you
wouldn
t
have
been
pleased
if
they
hadn
t
now
about
this
charm
we
haven
t
got
over
and
above
too
much
tin
and
if
we
blue
it
all
on
this
charm
and
it
turns
out
to
be
not
up
to
much
well
you
see
what
i
m
driving
at
don
t
you
i
see
that
you
don
t
see
more
than
the
length
of
your
nose
and
that
s
not
far
said
the
psammead
crossly
look
here
i
had
to
give
you
the
wishes
and
of
course
they
turned
out
badly
in
a
sort
of
way
because
you
hadn
t
the
sense
to
wish
for
what
was
good
for
you
but
this
charm
s
quite
different
i
haven
t
got
to
do
this
for
you
it
s
just
my
own
generous
kindness
that
makes
me
tell
you
about
it
so
it
s
bound
to
be
all
right
see
don
t
be
cross
said
anthea
please
please
don
t
you
see
it
s
all
we
ve
got
we
shan
t
have
any
more
till
daddy
comes
home
unless
he
sends
us
some
in
a
letter
but
we
do
trust
you
and
i
say
all
of
you
she
went
on
don
t
you
think
it
s
worth
spending
all
the
money
if
there
s
even
the
chanciest
chance
of
getting
father
and
mother
back
safe
now
just
think
of
it
oh
do
let
s
don
t
care
what
you
do
said
the
psammead
i
ll
go
back
to
sand
again
till
you
ve
made
up
your
no
don
t
said
everybody
and
jane
added
we
are
quite
mind
don
t
you
see
we
are
let
s
get
our
hats
will
you
come
with
us
of
course
said
the
psammead
how
else
would
you
find
the
shop
so
everybody
got
its
hat
the
psammead
was
put
into
a
flat
that
had
come
from
farringdon
market
with
two
pounds
of
filleted
plaice
in
it
now
it
contained
about
three
pounds
and
a
quarter
of
solid
psammead
and
the
children
took
it
in
turns
to
carry
it
it
s
not
half
the
weight
of
the
lamb
robert
said
and
the
girls
sighed
the
psammead
poked
a
wary
eye
out
of
the
top
of
the
basket
every
now
and
then
and
told
the
children
which
turnings
to
take
how
on
earth
do
you
know
asked
robert
i
can
t
think
how
you
do
and
the
psammead
said
sharply
no
i
don
t
suppose
you
at
last
they
came
to
the
shop
it
had
all
sorts
and
kinds
of
things
in
the
window
concertinas
and
silk
handkerchiefs
china
vases
and
blue
japanese
jars
pipes
swords
pistols
lace
collars
silver
spoons
tied
up
in
and
in
a
red
lacquered
basin
there
were
officers
epaulets
and
doctors
lancets
there
were
inlaid
with
red
and
brass
plates
of
different
kinds
of
money
and
stacks
of
different
kinds
of
plates
there
was
a
beautiful
picture
of
a
little
girl
washing
a
dog
which
jane
liked
very
much
and
in
the
middle
of
the
window
there
was
a
dirty
silver
tray
full
of
card
counters
old
seals
paste
buckles
and
all
sorts
of
little
dingy
odds
and
ends
the
psammead
put
its
head
quite
out
of
the
to
look
in
the
window
when
cyril
said
there
s
a
tray
there
with
rubbish
in
and
then
its
long
snail
s
eyes
saw
something
that
made
them
stretch
out
so
much
that
they
were
as
long
and
thin
as
new
its
fur
bristled
thickly
and
its
voice
was
quite
hoarse
with
excitement
as
it
whispered
that
s
it
that
s
it
there
under
that
blue
and
yellow
buckle
you
can
see
a
bit
sticking
out
it
s
red
do
you
see
is
it
that
thing
something
like
a
asked
cyril
and
red
like
the
common
you
do
up
parcels
with
yes
that
s
it
said
the
psammead
now
you
do
just
as
you
did
before
ask
the
price
of
other
things
that
blue
buckle
would
do
then
the
man
will
get
the
tray
out
of
the
window
i
think
you
d
better
be
the
one
it
said
to
anthea
we
ll
wait
out
so
the
others
flattened
their
noses
against
the
shop
window
and
presently
a
large
dirty
hand
with
a
very
big
diamond
ring
came
stretching
through
the
green
at
the
back
of
the
shop
window
and
took
away
the
tray
they
could
not
see
what
was
happening
in
the
interview
between
anthea
and
the
diamond
ring
and
it
seemed
to
them
that
she
had
had
time
if
she
had
had
money
to
buy
everything
in
the
shop
before
the
moment
came
when
she
stood
before
them
her
face
wreathed
in
grins
as
cyril
said
later
and
in
her
hand
the
charm
it
was
something
like
this
drawing
omitted
and
it
was
made
of
a
red
smooth
softly
shiny
stone
i
ve
got
it
anthea
whispered
just
opening
her
hand
to
give
the
others
a
glimpse
of
it
do
let
s
get
home
we
can
t
stand
here
like
looking
at
it
in
the
so
home
they
went
the
parlour
in
fitzroy
street
was
a
very
flat
background
to
magic
happenings
down
in
the
country
among
the
flowers
and
green
fields
anything
had
seemed
and
indeed
had
been
possible
but
it
was
hard
to
believe
that
anything
really
wonderful
could
happen
so
near
the
tottenham
court
road
but
the
psammead
was
there
and
it
in
itself
was
wonderful
and
it
could
talk
and
it
had
shown
them
where
a
charm
could
be
bought
that
would
make
the
owner
of
it
perfectly
happy
so
the
four
children
hurried
home
taking
very
long
steps
with
their
chins
stuck
out
and
their
mouths
shut
very
tight
indeed
they
went
so
fast
that
the
psammead
was
quite
shaken
about
in
its
but
it
did
not
say
anything
perhaps
for
fear
of
attracting
public
notice
they
got
home
at
last
very
hot
indeed
and
set
the
psammead
on
the
green
tablecloth
now
then
said
cyril
but
the
psammead
had
to
have
a
plate
of
sand
fetched
for
it
for
it
was
quite
faint
when
it
had
refreshed
itself
a
little
it
said
now
then
let
me
see
the
charm
and
anthea
laid
it
on
the
green
the
psammead
shot
out
his
long
eyes
to
look
at
it
then
it
turned
them
reproachfully
on
anthea
and
said
but
there
s
only
half
of
it
here
this
was
indeed
a
blow
it
was
all
there
was
said
anthea
with
timid
firmness
she
knew
it
was
not
her
fault
there
should
be
another
piece
said
the
psammead
and
a
sort
of
pin
to
fasten
the
two
isn
t
half
any
good
won
t
it
work
without
the
other
bit
it
cost
oh
bother
bother
bother
don
t
be
silly
little
idiots
said
everyone
and
the
psammead
altogether
then
there
was
a
wretched
silence
cyril
broke
it
what
shall
we
do
go
back
to
the
shop
and
see
if
they
haven
t
got
the
other
half
said
the
psammead
i
ll
go
to
sand
till
you
come
back
cheer
up
even
the
bit
you
ve
got
is
some
good
but
it
ll
be
no
end
of
a
bother
if
you
can
t
find
the
so
cyril
went
to
the
shop
and
the
psammead
to
sand
and
the
other
three
went
to
dinner
which
was
now
ready
and
old
nurse
was
very
cross
that
cyril
was
not
ready
too
the
three
were
watching
at
the
windows
when
cyril
returned
and
even
before
he
was
near
enough
for
them
to
see
his
face
there
was
something
about
the
slouch
of
his
shoulders
and
set
of
his
knickerbockers
and
the
way
he
dragged
his
boots
along
that
showed
but
too
plainly
that
his
errand
had
been
in
vain
well
they
all
said
hoping
against
hope
on
the
step
no
go
cyril
answered
the
man
said
the
thing
was
perfect
he
said
it
was
a
roman
lady
s
locket
and
people
shouldn
t
buy
curios
if
they
didn
t
know
anything
about
arky
something
or
other
and
that
he
never
went
back
on
a
bargain
because
it
wasn
t
business
and
he
expected
his
customers
to
act
the
same
he
was
simply
nasty
that
s
what
he
was
and
i
want
my
it
was
plain
that
cyril
was
not
pleased
the
unlikeliness
of
anything
really
interesting
happening
in
that
parlour
lay
like
a
weight
of
lead
on
everyone
s
spirits
cyril
had
his
dinner
and
just
as
he
was
swallowing
the
last
mouthful
of
there
was
a
scratch
at
the
door
anthea
opened
it
and
in
walked
the
psammead
well
it
said
when
it
had
heard
the
news
things
might
be
worse
only
you
won
t
be
surprised
if
you
have
a
few
adventures
before
you
get
the
other
half
you
want
to
get
it
of
rather
was
the
general
reply
and
we
don
t
mind
no
said
the
psammead
i
seem
to
remember
that
about
you
well
sit
down
and
listen
with
all
your
ears
eight
are
there
right
i
am
glad
you
know
arithmetic
now
pay
attention
because
i
don
t
intend
to
tell
you
everything
twice
as
the
children
settled
themselves
on
the
floor
it
was
far
more
comfortable
than
the
chairs
as
well
as
more
polite
to
the
psammead
who
was
stroking
its
whiskers
on
the
a
sudden
cold
pain
caught
at
anthea
s
heart
father
mother
the
darling
lamb
all
far
away
then
a
warm
comfortable
feeling
flowed
through
her
the
psammead
was
here
and
at
least
half
a
charm
and
there
were
to
be
adventures
if
you
don
t
know
what
a
cold
pain
is
i
am
glad
for
your
sakes
and
i
hope
you
never
may
now
said
the
psammead
cheerily
you
are
not
particularly
nice
nor
particularly
clever
and
you
re
not
at
all
still
you
ve
saved
my
life
oh
when
i
think
of
that
man
and
his
pail
of
water
so
i
ll
tell
you
all
i
know
at
least
of
course
i
can
t
do
that
because
i
know
far
too
much
but
i
ll
tell
you
all
i
know
about
this
red
do
do
do
do
said
everyone
well
then
said
the
psammead
this
thing
is
half
of
an
amulet
that
can
do
all
sorts
of
things
it
can
make
the
corn
grow
and
the
waters
flow
and
the
trees
bear
fruit
and
the
little
new
beautiful
babies
come
not
that
babies
are
beautiful
of
course
it
broke
off
to
say
but
their
mothers
think
they
are
and
as
long
as
you
think
a
thing
s
true
it
is
true
as
far
as
you
re
concerned
robert
yawned
the
psammead
went
on
the
complete
amulet
can
keep
off
all
the
things
that
make
people
unhappy
jealousy
bad
temper
pride
disagreeableness
greediness
selfishness
laziness
evil
spirits
people
called
them
when
the
amulet
was
made
don
t
you
think
it
would
be
nice
to
have
it
very
said
the
children
quite
without
enthusiasm
and
it
can
give
you
strength
and
that
s
better
said
cyril
and
i
suppose
it
s
nice
to
have
that
said
jane
but
not
with
much
interest
and
it
can
give
you
your
heart
s
now
you
re
talking
said
robert
of
course
i
am
retorted
the
psammead
tartly
so
there
s
no
need
for
you
heart
s
desire
is
good
enough
for
me
said
cyril
yes
but
anthea
ventured
all
that
s
what
the
whole
charm
can
do
there
s
something
that
the
half
we
ve
got
can
win
off
its
own
bat
isn
t
there
she
appealed
to
the
psammead
it
nodded
yes
it
said
the
half
has
the
power
to
take
you
anywhere
you
like
to
look
for
the
other
this
seemed
a
brilliant
prospect
till
robert
asked
does
it
know
where
to
look
the
psammead
shook
its
head
and
answered
i
don
t
think
it
s
do
you
then
said
robert
we
might
as
well
look
for
a
needle
in
a
bottle
of
hay
yes
it
is
bottle
and
not
bundle
father
said
not
at
all
said
the
psammead
you
think
you
know
everything
but
you
are
quite
mistaken
the
first
thing
is
to
get
the
thing
to
can
it
jane
questioned
jane
s
question
did
not
mean
that
she
thought
it
couldn
t
for
in
spite
of
the
parlour
furniture
the
feeling
of
magic
was
growing
deeper
and
thicker
and
seemed
to
fill
the
room
like
a
dream
of
a
scented
fog
of
course
it
can
i
suppose
you
can
oh
yes
everyone
was
rather
hurt
at
the
question
well
then
all
you
ve
got
to
do
is
to
read
the
name
that
s
written
on
the
part
of
the
charm
that
you
ve
got
and
as
soon
as
you
say
the
name
out
loud
the
thing
will
have
power
to
do
well
several
there
was
a
silence
the
red
charm
was
passed
from
hand
to
hand
there
s
no
name
on
it
said
cyril
at
last
nonsense
said
the
psammead
what
s
that
oh
that
said
cyril
it
s
not
reading
it
looks
like
pictures
of
chickens
and
snakes
and
this
was
what
was
on
the
charm
hieroglyphics
omitted
i
ve
no
patience
with
you
said
the
psammead
if
you
can
t
read
you
must
find
some
one
who
can
a
priest
now
we
don
t
know
any
priests
said
anthea
we
know
a
clergyman
he
s
called
a
priest
in
the
you
know
but
he
only
knows
greek
and
latin
and
hebrew
and
this
isn
t
any
of
those
i
the
psammead
stamped
a
furry
foot
angrily
i
wish
i
d
never
seen
you
it
said
you
aren
t
any
more
good
than
so
many
stone
images
not
so
much
if
i
m
to
tell
the
truth
is
there
no
wise
man
in
your
babylon
who
can
pronounce
the
names
of
the
great
ones
there
s
a
poor
learned
gentleman
upstairs
said
anthea
we
might
try
him
he
has
a
lot
of
stone
images
in
his
room
and
ones
too
we
peeped
in
once
when
he
was
out
old
nurse
says
he
doesn
t
eat
enough
to
keep
a
canary
alive
he
spends
it
all
on
stones
and
try
him
said
the
psammead
only
be
careful
if
he
knows
a
greater
name
than
this
and
uses
it
against
you
your
charm
will
be
of
no
use
bind
him
first
with
the
chains
of
honour
and
upright
dealing
and
then
ask
his
aid
oh
yes
you
d
better
all
go
you
can
put
me
to
sand
as
you
go
upstairs
i
must
have
a
few
minutes
peace
and
so
the
four
children
hastily
washed
their
hands
and
brushed
their
hair
this
was
anthea
s
idea
and
went
up
to
knock
at
the
door
of
the
poor
learned
gentleman
and
to
bind
him
with
the
chains
of
honour
and
upright
dealing
chapter
the
past
the
learned
gentleman
had
let
his
dinner
get
quite
cold
it
was
mutton
chop
and
as
it
lay
on
the
plate
it
looked
like
a
brown
island
in
the
middle
of
a
frozen
pond
because
the
grease
of
the
gravy
had
become
cold
and
consequently
white
it
looked
very
nasty
and
it
was
the
first
thing
the
children
saw
when
after
knocking
three
times
and
receiving
no
reply
one
of
them
ventured
to
turn
the
handle
and
softly
to
open
the
door
the
chop
was
on
the
end
of
a
long
table
that
ran
down
one
side
of
the
room
the
table
had
images
on
it
and
stones
and
books
and
there
were
glass
cases
fixed
against
the
wall
behind
with
little
strange
things
in
them
the
cases
were
rather
like
the
ones
you
see
in
jewellers
shops
the
poor
learned
gentleman
was
sitting
at
a
table
in
the
window
looking
at
something
very
small
which
he
held
in
a
pair
of
fine
pincers
he
had
a
round
sort
of
thing
in
one
eye
which
reminded
the
children
of
watchmakers
and
also
of
the
long
snail
s
eyes
of
the
psammead
the
gentleman
was
very
long
and
thin
and
his
long
thin
boots
stuck
out
under
the
other
side
of
his
table
he
did
not
hear
the
door
open
and
the
children
stood
hesitating
at
last
robert
gave
the
door
a
push
and
they
all
started
back
for
in
the
middle
of
the
wall
that
the
door
had
hidden
was
a
very
very
very
big
painted
in
red
and
yellow
and
green
and
black
and
the
face
of
it
seemed
to
look
at
them
quite
angrily
you
know
what
a
is
like
of
course
if
you
don
t
you
had
better
go
to
the
british
museum
at
once
and
find
out
anyway
it
is
not
at
all
the
sort
of
thing
that
you
expect
to
meet
in
a
front
in
bloomsbury
looking
as
though
it
would
like
to
know
what
business
you
had
there
so
everyone
said
oh
rather
loud
and
their
boots
clattered
as
they
stumbled
back
the
learned
gentleman
took
the
glass
out
of
his
eye
and
said
i
beg
your
pardon
in
a
very
soft
quiet
pleasant
voice
the
voice
of
a
gentleman
who
has
been
to
oxford
it
s
us
that
beg
yours
said
cyril
politely
we
are
sorry
to
disturb
come
in
said
the
gentleman
rising
with
the
most
distinguished
courtesy
anthea
told
herself
i
am
delighted
to
see
you
won
t
you
sit
down
no
not
there
allow
me
to
move
that
he
cleared
a
chair
and
stood
smiling
and
looking
kindly
through
his
large
round
spectacles
he
treats
us
like
whispered
robert
and
he
doesn
t
seem
to
know
how
many
of
us
there
hush
said
anthea
it
isn
t
manners
to
whisper
you
say
cyril
go
we
re
very
sorry
to
disturb
you
said
cyril
politely
but
we
did
knock
three
times
and
you
didn
t
say
come
in
or
run
away
now
or
that
you
couldn
t
be
bothered
just
now
or
to
come
when
you
weren
t
so
busy
or
any
of
the
things
people
do
say
when
you
knock
at
doors
so
we
opened
it
we
knew
you
were
in
because
we
heard
you
sneeze
while
we
were
not
at
all
said
the
gentleman
do
sit
he
has
found
out
there
are
four
of
us
said
robert
as
the
gentleman
cleared
three
more
chairs
he
put
the
things
off
them
carefully
on
the
floor
the
first
chair
had
things
like
bricks
that
tiny
tiny
birds
feet
have
walked
over
when
the
bricks
were
soft
only
the
marks
were
in
regular
lines
the
second
chair
had
round
things
on
it
like
very
large
fat
long
pale
beads
and
the
last
chair
had
a
pile
of
dusty
papers
on
it
the
children
sat
down
we
know
you
are
very
very
learned
said
cyril
and
we
have
got
a
charm
and
we
want
you
to
read
the
name
on
it
because
it
isn
t
in
latin
or
greek
or
hebrew
or
any
of
the
languages
we
know
a
thorough
knowledge
of
even
those
languages
is
a
very
fair
foundation
on
which
to
build
an
education
said
the
gentleman
politely
oh
said
cyril
blushing
but
we
only
know
them
to
look
at
except
latin
and
i
m
only
in
caesar
with
the
gentleman
took
off
his
spectacles
and
laughed
his
laugh
sounded
rusty
cyril
thought
as
though
it
wasn
t
often
used
of
course
he
said
i
m
sure
i
beg
your
pardon
i
think
i
must
have
been
in
a
dream
you
are
the
children
who
live
downstairs
are
you
not
yes
i
have
seen
you
as
i
have
passed
in
and
out
and
you
have
found
something
that
you
think
to
be
an
antiquity
and
you
ve
brought
it
to
show
me
that
was
very
kind
i
should
like
to
inspect
i
m
afraid
we
didn
t
think
about
your
liking
to
inspect
it
said
the
truthful
anthea
it
was
just
for
us
because
we
wanted
to
know
the
name
on
it
oh
yes
and
i
say
robert
interjected
you
won
t
think
it
rude
of
us
if
we
ask
you
first
before
we
show
it
to
be
bound
in
the
of
in
the
bonds
of
honour
and
upright
dealing
said
anthea
i
m
afraid
i
don
t
quite
follow
you
said
the
gentleman
with
gentle
nervousness
well
it
s
this
way
said
cyril
we
ve
got
part
of
a
charm
and
the
sammy
i
mean
something
told
us
it
would
work
though
it
s
only
half
a
one
but
it
won
t
work
unless
we
can
say
the
name
that
s
on
it
but
of
course
if
you
ve
got
another
name
that
can
lick
ours
our
charm
will
be
no
go
so
we
want
you
to
give
us
your
word
of
honour
as
a
gentleman
though
i
m
sure
now
i
ve
seen
you
that
it
s
not
necessary
but
still
i
ve
promised
to
ask
you
so
we
must
will
you
please
give
us
your
honourable
word
not
to
say
any
name
stronger
than
the
name
on
our
charm
the
gentleman
had
put
on
his
spectacles
again
and
was
looking
at
cyril
through
them
he
now
said
bless
me
more
than
once
adding
who
told
you
all
this
i
can
t
tell
you
said
cyril
i
m
very
sorry
but
i
can
some
faint
memory
of
a
childhood
must
have
come
to
the
learned
gentleman
just
then
for
he
smiled
i
see
he
said
it
is
some
sort
of
game
that
you
are
engaged
in
of
course
yes
well
i
will
certainly
promise
yet
i
wonder
how
you
heard
of
the
names
of
power
we
can
t
tell
you
that
either
said
cyril
and
anthea
said
here
is
our
charm
and
held
it
out
with
politeness
but
without
interest
the
gentleman
took
it
but
after
the
first
glance
all
his
body
suddenly
stiffened
as
a
pointer
s
does
when
he
sees
a
partridge
excuse
me
he
said
in
quite
a
changed
voice
and
carried
the
charm
to
the
window
he
looked
at
it
he
turned
it
over
he
fixed
his
in
his
eye
and
looked
again
no
one
said
anything
only
robert
made
a
shuffling
noise
with
his
feet
till
anthea
nudged
him
to
shut
up
at
last
the
learned
gentleman
drew
a
long
breath
where
did
you
find
this
he
asked
we
didn
t
find
it
we
bought
it
at
a
shop
jacob
absalom
the
name
is
not
far
from
charing
cross
said
cyril
we
gave
for
it
added
jane
it
is
not
for
sale
i
suppose
you
do
not
wish
to
part
with
it
i
ought
to
tell
you
that
it
is
extremely
valuable
extraordinarily
valuable
i
may
yes
said
cyril
we
know
that
so
of
course
we
want
to
keep
keep
it
carefully
then
said
the
gentleman
impressively
and
if
ever
you
should
wish
to
part
with
it
may
i
ask
you
to
give
me
the
refusal
of
it
the
refusal
i
mean
do
not
sell
it
to
anyone
else
until
you
have
given
me
the
opportunity
of
buying
all
right
said
cyril
we
won
t
but
we
don
t
want
to
sell
it
we
want
to
make
it
do
i
suppose
you
can
play
at
that
as
well
as
at
anything
else
said
the
gentleman
but
i
m
afraid
the
days
of
magic
are
they
aren
t
really
said
anthea
earnestly
you
d
see
they
aren
t
if
i
could
tell
you
about
our
last
summer
holidays
only
i
mustn
t
thank
you
very
much
and
can
you
read
the
name
yes
i
can
read
will
you
tell
it
us
the
name
said
the
gentleman
is
ur
hekau
ur
hekau
setcheh
repeated
cyril
thanks
awfully
i
do
hope
we
haven
t
taken
up
too
much
of
your
not
at
all
said
the
gentleman
and
do
let
me
entreat
you
to
be
very
very
careful
of
that
most
valuable
they
said
thank
you
in
all
the
different
polite
ways
they
could
think
of
and
filed
out
of
the
door
and
down
the
stairs
anthea
was
last
down
to
the
first
landing
she
turned
and
ran
up
again
the
door
was
still
open
and
the
learned
gentleman
and
the
were
standing
opposite
to
each
other
and
both
looked
as
though
they
had
stood
like
that
for
years
the
gentleman
started
when
anthea
put
her
hand
on
his
arm
i
hope
you
won
t
be
cross
and
say
it
s
not
my
business
she
said
but
do
look
at
your
chop
don
t
you
think
you
ought
to
eat
it
father
forgets
his
dinner
sometimes
when
he
s
writing
and
mother
always
says
i
ought
to
remind
him
if
she
s
not
at
home
to
do
it
herself
because
it
s
so
bad
to
miss
your
regular
meals
so
i
thought
perhaps
you
wouldn
t
mind
my
reminding
you
because
you
don
t
seem
to
have
anyone
else
to
do
she
glanced
at
the
it
certainly
did
not
look
as
though
it
would
ever
think
of
reminding
people
of
their
meals
the
learned
gentleman
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
before
he
said
thank
you
my
dear
it
was
a
kindly
thought
no
i
haven
t
anyone
to
remind
me
about
things
like
he
sighed
and
looked
at
the
chop
it
looks
very
nasty
said
anthea
yes
he
said
it
does
i
ll
eat
it
immediately
before
i
as
he
ate
it
he
sighed
more
than
once
perhaps
because
the
chop
was
nasty
perhaps
because
he
longed
for
the
charm
which
the
children
did
not
want
to
sell
perhaps
because
it
was
so
long
since
anyone
cared
whether
he
ate
his
chops
or
forgot
them
anthea
caught
the
others
at
the
they
woke
the
psammead
and
it
taught
them
exactly
how
to
use
the
word
of
power
and
to
make
the
charm
speak
i
am
not
going
to
tell
you
how
this
is
done
because
you
might
try
to
do
it
and
for
you
any
such
trying
would
be
almost
sure
to
end
in
disappointment
because
in
the
first
place
it
is
a
thousand
million
to
one
against
your
ever
getting
hold
of
the
right
sort
of
charm
and
if
you
did
there
would
be
hardly
any
chance
at
all
of
your
finding
a
learned
gentleman
clever
enough
and
kind
enough
to
read
the
word
for
you
the
children
and
the
psammead
crouched
in
a
circle
on
the
floor
in
the
girls
bedroom
because
in
the
parlour
they
might
have
been
interrupted
by
old
nurse
s
coming
in
to
lay
the
cloth
for
tea
and
the
charm
was
put
in
the
middle
of
the
circle
the
sun
shone
splendidly
outside
and
the
room
was
very
light
through
the
open
window
came
the
hum
and
rattle
of
london
and
in
the
street
below
they
could
hear
the
voice
of
the
milkman
when
all
was
ready
the
psammead
signed
to
anthea
to
say
the
word
and
she
said
it
instantly
the
whole
light
of
all
the
world
seemed
to
go
out
the
room
was
dark
the
world
outside
was
dark
darker
than
the
darkest
night
that
ever
was
and
all
the
sounds
went
out
too
so
that
there
was
a
silence
deeper
than
any
silence
you
have
ever
even
dreamed
of
imagining
it
was
like
being
suddenly
deaf
and
blind
only
darker
and
quieter
even
than
that
but
before
the
children
had
got
over
the
sudden
shock
of
it
enough
to
be
frightened
a
faint
beautiful
light
began
to
show
in
the
middle
of
the
circle
and
at
the
same
moment
a
faint
beautiful
voice
began
to
speak
the
light
was
too
small
for
one
to
see
anything
by
and
the
voice
was
too
small
for
you
to
hear
what
it
said
you
could
just
see
the
light
and
just
hear
the
voice
but
the
light
grew
stronger
it
was
greeny
like
lamps
and
it
grew
and
grew
till
it
was
as
though
thousands
and
thousands
of
were
signalling
to
their
winged
sweethearts
from
the
middle
of
the
circle
and
the
voice
grew
not
so
much
in
loudness
as
in
sweetness
though
it
grew
louder
too
till
it
was
so
sweet
that
you
wanted
to
cry
with
pleasure
just
at
the
sound
of
it
it
was
like
nightingales
and
the
sea
and
the
fiddle
and
the
voice
of
your
mother
when
you
have
been
a
long
time
away
and
she
meets
you
at
the
door
when
you
get
home
and
the
voice
said
speak
what
is
it
that
you
would
hear
i
can
not
tell
you
what
language
the
voice
used
i
only
know
that
everyone
present
understood
it
perfectly
if
you
come
to
think
of
it
there
must
be
some
language
that
everyone
could
understand
if
we
only
knew
what
it
was
nor
can
i
tell
you
how
the
charm
spoke
nor
whether
it
was
the
charm
that
spoke
or
some
presence
in
the
charm
the
children
could
not
have
told
you
either
indeed
they
could
not
look
at
the
charm
while
it
was
speaking
because
the
light
was
too
bright
they
looked
instead
at
the
green
radiance
on
the
faded
kidderminster
carpet
at
the
edge
of
the
circle
they
all
felt
very
quiet
and
not
inclined
to
ask
questions
or
fidget
with
their
feet
for
this
was
not
like
the
things
that
had
happened
in
the
country
when
the
psammead
had
given
them
their
wishes
that
had
been
funny
somehow
and
this
was
not
it
was
something
like
arabian
nights
magic
and
something
like
being
in
church
no
one
cared
to
speak
it
was
cyril
who
said
at
last
please
we
want
to
know
where
the
other
half
of
the
charm
the
part
of
the
amulet
which
is
lost
said
the
beautiful
voice
was
broken
and
ground
into
the
dust
of
the
shrine
that
held
it
it
and
the
pin
that
joined
the
two
halves
are
themselves
dust
and
the
dust
is
scattered
over
many
lands
and
sunk
in
many
oh
i
say
murmured
robert
and
a
blank
silence
fell
then
it
s
all
up
said
cyril
at
last
it
s
no
use
our
looking
for
a
thing
that
s
smashed
into
dust
and
the
dust
scattered
all
over
the
if
you
would
find
it
said
the
voice
you
must
seek
it
where
it
still
is
perfect
as
i
don
t
understand
said
cyril
in
the
past
you
may
find
it
said
the
voice
i
wish
we
may
find
it
said
cyril
the
psammead
whispered
crossly
don
t
you
understand
the
thing
existed
in
the
past
if
you
were
in
the
past
too
you
could
find
it
it
s
very
difficult
to
make
you
understand
things
time
and
space
are
only
forms
of
i
see
said
cyril
no
you
don
t
said
the
psammead
and
it
doesn
t
matter
if
you
don
t
either
what
i
mean
is
that
if
you
were
only
made
the
right
way
you
could
see
everything
happening
in
the
same
place
at
the
same
time
now
do
you
see
i
m
afraid
don
t
said
anthea
i
m
sorry
i
m
so
well
at
any
rate
you
see
this
that
lost
half
of
the
amulet
is
in
the
past
therefore
it
s
in
the
past
we
must
look
for
it
i
mustn
t
speak
to
the
charm
myself
ask
it
things
find
out
where
can
we
find
the
other
part
of
you
asked
cyril
obediently
in
the
past
said
the
voice
what
part
of
the
past
i
may
not
tell
you
if
you
will
choose
a
time
i
will
take
you
to
the
place
that
then
held
it
you
yourselves
must
find
when
did
you
see
it
last
asked
anthea
i
mean
when
was
it
taken
away
from
you
the
beautiful
voice
answered
that
was
thousands
of
years
ago
the
amulet
was
perfect
then
and
lay
in
a
shrine
the
last
of
many
shrines
and
i
worked
wonders
then
came
strange
men
with
strange
weapons
and
destroyed
my
shrine
and
the
amulet
they
bore
away
with
many
captives
but
of
these
one
my
priest
knew
the
word
of
power
and
spoke
it
for
me
so
that
the
amulet
became
invisible
and
thus
returned
to
my
shrine
but
the
shrine
was
broken
down
and
ere
any
magic
could
rebuild
it
one
spoke
a
word
before
which
my
power
bowed
down
and
was
still
and
the
amulet
lay
there
still
perfect
but
enslaved
then
one
coming
with
stones
to
rebuild
the
shrine
dropped
a
hewn
stone
on
the
amulet
as
it
lay
and
one
half
was
sundered
from
the
other
i
had
no
power
to
seek
for
that
which
was
lost
and
there
being
none
to
speak
the
word
of
power
i
could
not
rejoin
it
so
the
amulet
lay
in
the
dust
of
the
desert
many
thousand
years
and
at
last
came
a
small
man
a
conqueror
with
an
army
and
after
him
a
crowd
of
men
who
sought
to
seem
wise
and
one
of
these
found
half
the
amulet
and
brought
it
to
this
land
but
none
could
read
the
name
so
i
lay
still
and
this
man
dying
and
his
son
after
him
the
amulet
was
sold
by
those
who
came
after
to
a
merchant
and
from
him
you
bought
it
and
it
is
here
and
now
the
name
of
power
having
been
spoken
i
also
am
this
is
what
the
voice
said
i
think
it
must
have
meant
napoleon
by
the
small
man
the
conqueror
because
i
know
i
have
been
told
that
he
took
an
army
to
egypt
and
that
afterwards
a
lot
of
wise
people
went
grubbing
in
the
sand
and
fished
up
all
sorts
of
wonderful
things
older
than
you
would
think
possible
and
of
these
i
believe
this
charm
to
have
been
one
and
the
most
wonderful
one
of
all
everyone
listened
and
everyone
tried
to
think
it
is
not
easy
to
do
this
clearly
when
you
have
been
listening
to
the
kind
of
talk
i
have
told
you
about
at
last
robert
said
can
you
take
us
into
the
past
to
the
shrine
where
you
and
the
other
thing
were
together
if
you
could
take
us
there
we
might
find
the
other
part
still
there
after
all
these
thousands
of
still
there
silly
said
cyril
don
t
you
see
if
we
go
back
into
the
past
it
won
t
be
thousands
of
years
ago
it
will
be
now
for
us
won
t
it
he
appealed
to
the
psammead
who
said
you
re
not
so
far
off
the
idea
as
you
usually
are
well
said
anthea
will
you
take
us
back
to
when
there
was
a
shrine
and
you
were
safe
in
it
all
of
you
yes
said
the
voice
you
must
hold
me
up
and
speak
the
word
of
power
and
one
by
one
beginning
with
the
you
shall
pass
through
me
into
the
past
but
let
the
last
that
passes
be
the
one
that
holds
me
and
let
him
not
lose
his
hold
lest
you
lose
me
and
so
remain
in
the
past
for
that
s
a
nasty
idea
said
robert
when
you
desire
to
return
the
beautiful
voice
went
on
hold
me
up
towards
the
east
and
speak
the
word
then
passing
through
me
you
shall
return
to
this
time
and
it
shall
be
the
present
to
but
how
a
bell
rang
loudly
oh
crikey
exclaimed
robert
that
s
tea
will
you
please
make
it
proper
daylight
again
so
that
we
can
go
down
and
thank
you
so
much
for
all
your
we
ve
enjoyed
ourselves
very
much
indeed
thank
you
added
anthea
politely
the
beautiful
light
faded
slowly
the
great
darkness
and
silence
came
and
these
suddenly
changed
to
the
dazzlement
of
day
and
the
great
soft
rustling
sound
of
london
that
is
like
some
vast
beast
turning
over
in
its
sleep
the
children
rubbed
their
eyes
the
psammead
ran
quickly
to
its
sandy
bath
and
the
others
went
down
to
tea
and
until
the
cups
were
actually
filled
tea
seemed
less
real
than
the
beautiful
voice
and
the
greeny
light
after
tea
anthea
persuaded
the
others
to
allow
her
to
hang
the
charm
round
her
neck
with
a
piece
of
string
it
would
be
so
awful
if
it
got
lost
she
said
it
might
get
lost
anywhere
you
know
and
it
would
be
rather
beastly
for
us
to
have
to
stay
in
the
past
for
ever
and
ever
wouldn
t
it
chapter
eight
thousand
years
ago
next
morning
anthea
got
old
nurse
to
allow
her
to
take
up
the
poor
learned
gentleman
s
breakfast
he
did
not
recognize
her
at
first
but
when
he
did
he
was
vaguely
pleased
to
see
her
you
see
i
m
wearing
the
charm
round
my
neck
she
said
i
m
taking
care
of
it
like
you
told
us
that
s
right
said
he
did
you
have
a
good
game
last
night
you
will
eat
your
breakfast
before
it
s
cold
won
t
you
said
anthea
yes
we
had
a
splendid
time
the
charm
made
it
all
dark
and
then
greeny
light
and
then
it
spoke
oh
i
wish
you
could
have
heard
it
it
was
such
a
darling
voice
and
it
told
us
the
other
half
of
it
was
lost
in
the
past
so
of
course
we
shall
have
to
look
for
it
there
the
learned
gentleman
rubbed
his
hair
with
both
hands
and
looked
anxiously
at
anthea
i
suppose
it
s
natural
youthful
imagination
and
so
forth
he
said
yet
someone
must
have
who
told
you
that
some
part
of
the
charm
was
missing
i
can
t
tell
you
she
said
i
know
it
seems
most
awfully
rude
especially
after
being
so
kind
about
telling
us
the
name
of
power
and
all
that
but
really
i
m
not
allowed
to
tell
anybody
anything
about
the
the
the
person
who
told
me
you
won
t
forget
your
breakfast
will
you
the
learned
gentleman
smiled
feebly
and
then
frowned
not
a
but
a
thank
you
he
said
i
shall
always
be
pleased
if
you
ll
look
in
any
time
you
re
passing
you
know
at
least
i
will
she
said
goodbye
i
ll
always
tell
you
anything
i
may
he
had
not
had
many
adventures
with
children
in
them
and
he
wondered
whether
all
children
were
like
these
he
spent
quite
five
minutes
in
wondering
before
he
settled
down
to
the
chapter
of
his
great
book
on
the
secret
rites
of
the
priests
of
amen
ra
it
is
no
use
to
pretend
that
the
children
did
not
feel
a
good
deal
of
agitation
at
the
thought
of
going
through
the
charm
into
the
past
that
idea
that
perhaps
they
might
stay
in
the
past
and
never
get
back
again
was
anything
but
pleasing
yet
no
one
would
have
dared
to
suggest
that
the
charm
should
not
be
used
and
though
each
was
in
its
heart
very
frightened
indeed
they
would
all
have
joined
in
jeering
at
the
cowardice
of
any
one
of
them
who
should
have
uttered
the
timid
but
natural
suggestion
don
t
let
s
it
seemed
necessary
to
make
arrangements
for
being
out
all
day
for
there
was
no
reason
to
suppose
that
the
sound
of
the
would
be
able
to
reach
back
into
the
past
and
it
seemed
unwise
to
excite
old
nurse
s
curiosity
when
nothing
they
could
say
not
even
the
truth
could
in
any
way
satisfy
it
they
were
all
very
proud
to
think
how
well
they
had
understood
what
the
charm
and
the
psammead
had
said
about
time
and
space
and
things
like
that
and
they
were
perfectly
certain
that
it
would
be
quite
impossible
to
make
old
nurse
understand
a
single
word
of
it
so
they
merely
asked
her
to
let
them
take
their
dinner
out
into
regent
s
park
and
this
with
the
implied
cold
mutton
and
tomatoes
was
readily
granted
you
can
get
yourselves
some
buns
or
or
whatever
you
said
old
nurse
giving
cyril
a
shilling
don
t
go
getting
now
so
messy
at
the
best
of
times
and
without
forks
and
plates
ruination
to
your
clothes
besides
your
not
being
able
to
wash
your
hands
and
faces
so
cyril
took
the
shilling
and
they
all
started
off
they
went
round
by
the
tottenham
court
road
to
buy
a
piece
of
waterproof
sheeting
to
put
over
the
psammead
in
case
it
should
be
raining
in
the
past
when
they
got
there
for
it
is
almost
certain
death
to
a
psammead
to
get
wet
the
sun
was
shining
very
brightly
and
even
london
looked
pretty
women
were
selling
roses
from
big
and
anthea
bought
four
roses
one
each
for
herself
and
the
others
they
were
red
roses
and
smelt
of
summer
the
kind
of
roses
you
always
want
so
desperately
at
about
when
you
can
only
get
mistletoe
which
is
pale
right
through
to
its
very
scent
and
holly
which
pricks
your
nose
if
you
try
to
smell
it
so
now
everyone
had
a
rose
in
its
buttonhole
and
soon
everyone
was
sitting
on
the
grass
in
regent
s
park
under
trees
whose
leaves
would
have
been
clean
clear
green
in
the
country
but
here
were
dusty
and
yellowish
and
brown
at
the
edges
we
ve
got
to
go
on
with
it
said
anthea
and
as
the
eldest
has
to
go
first
you
ll
have
to
be
last
jane
you
quite
understand
about
holding
on
to
the
charm
as
you
go
through
don
t
you
pussy
i
wish
i
hadn
t
got
to
be
last
said
jane
you
shall
carry
the
psammead
if
you
like
said
anthea
that
is
she
added
remembering
the
beast
s
queer
temper
if
it
ll
let
the
psammead
however
was
unexpectedly
amiable
don
t
mind
it
said
who
carries
me
so
long
as
it
doesn
t
drop
me
i
can
t
bear
being
jane
with
trembling
hands
took
the
psammead
and
its
under
one
arm
the
charm
s
long
string
was
hung
round
her
neck
then
they
all
stood
up
jane
held
out
the
charm
at
arm
s
length
and
cyril
solemnly
pronounced
the
word
of
power
as
he
spoke
it
the
charm
grew
tall
and
broad
and
he
saw
that
jane
was
just
holding
on
to
the
edge
of
a
great
red
arch
of
very
curious
shape
the
opening
of
the
arch
was
small
but
cyril
saw
that
he
could
go
through
it
all
round
and
beyond
the
arch
were
the
faded
trees
and
trampled
grass
of
regent
s
park
where
the
little
ragged
children
were
playing
but
through
the
opening
of
it
shone
a
blaze
of
blue
and
yellow
and
red
cyril
drew
a
long
breath
and
stiffened
his
legs
so
that
the
others
should
not
see
that
his
knees
were
trembling
and
almost
knocking
together
here
goes
he
said
and
stepping
up
through
the
arch
disappeared
then
followed
anthea
robert
coming
next
held
fast
at
anthea
s
suggestion
to
the
sleeve
of
jane
who
was
thus
dragged
safely
through
the
arch
and
as
soon
as
they
were
on
the
other
side
of
the
arch
there
was
no
more
arch
at
all
and
no
more
regent
s
park
either
only
the
charm
in
jane
s
hand
and
it
was
its
proper
size
again
they
were
now
in
a
light
so
bright
that
they
winked
and
blinked
and
rubbed
their
eyes
during
this
dazzling
interval
anthea
felt
for
the
charm
and
pushed
it
inside
jane
s
frock
so
that
it
might
be
quite
safe
when
their
eyes
got
used
to
the
new
wonderful
light
the
children
looked
around
them
the
sky
was
very
very
blue
and
it
sparkled
and
glittered
and
dazzled
like
the
sea
at
home
when
the
sun
shines
on
it
they
were
standing
on
a
little
clearing
in
a
thick
low
forest
there
were
trees
and
shrubs
and
a
close
thorny
tangly
undergrowth
in
front
of
them
stretched
a
bank
of
strange
black
mud
then
came
the
shining
ribbon
of
a
river
then
more
dry
caked
mud
and
more
jungle
the
only
things
that
told
that
human
people
had
been
there
were
the
clearing
a
path
that
led
to
it
and
an
odd
arrangement
of
cut
reeds
in
the
river
they
looked
at
each
other
well
said
robert
this
is
a
change
of
air
it
was
the
air
was
hotter
than
they
could
have
imagined
even
in
london
in
august
i
wish
i
knew
where
we
were
said
cyril
here
s
a
river
now
i
wonder
whether
it
s
the
amazon
or
the
tiber
or
it
s
the
nile
said
the
psammead
looking
out
of
the
then
this
is
egypt
said
robert
who
had
once
taken
a
geography
prize
i
don
t
see
any
crocodiles
cyril
objected
his
prize
had
been
for
natural
history
the
psammead
reached
out
a
hairy
arm
from
its
basket
and
pointed
to
a
heap
of
mud
at
the
edge
of
the
water
what
do
you
call
that
it
said
and
as
it
spoke
the
heap
of
mud
slid
into
the
river
just
as
a
slab
of
damp
mixed
mortar
will
slip
from
a
bricklayer
s
trowel
oh
said
everybody
there
was
a
crashing
among
the
reeds
on
the
other
side
of
the
water
and
there
s
a
said
the
psammead
as
a
great
beast
like
an
enormous
slug
showed
itself
against
the
black
bank
on
the
far
side
of
the
stream
it
s
a
hippopotamus
said
cyril
it
seems
much
more
real
somehow
than
the
one
at
the
zoo
doesn
t
it
i
m
glad
it
s
being
real
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
said
jane
and
now
there
was
a
crackling
of
reeds
and
twigs
behind
them
this
was
horrible
of
course
it
might
be
another
hippopotamus
or
a
crocodile
or
a
lion
or
in
fact
almost
anything
keep
your
hand
on
the
charm
jane
said
robert
hastily
we
ought
to
have
a
means
of
escape
handy
i
m
dead
certain
this
is
the
sort
of
place
where
simply
anything
might
happen
to
i
believe
a
hippopotamus
is
going
to
happen
to
us
said
jane
a
very
very
big
they
had
all
turned
to
face
the
danger
don
t
be
silly
little
duffers
said
the
psammead
in
its
friendly
informal
way
it
s
not
a
it
s
a
it
was
it
was
a
girl
of
about
anthea
s
age
her
hair
was
short
and
fair
and
though
her
skin
was
tanned
by
the
sun
you
could
see
that
it
would
have
been
fair
too
if
it
had
had
a
chance
she
had
every
chance
of
being
tanned
for
she
had
no
clothes
to
speak
of
and
the
four
english
children
carefully
dressed
in
frocks
hats
shoes
stockings
coats
collars
and
all
the
rest
of
it
envied
her
more
than
any
words
of
theirs
or
of
mine
could
possibly
say
there
was
no
doubt
that
here
was
the
right
costume
for
that
climate
she
carried
a
pot
on
her
head
of
red
and
black
earthenware
she
did
not
see
the
children
who
shrank
back
against
the
edge
of
the
jungle
and
she
went
forward
to
the
brink
of
the
river
to
fill
her
pitcher
as
she
went
she
made
a
strange
sort
of
droning
humming
melancholy
noise
all
on
two
notes
anthea
could
not
help
thinking
that
perhaps
the
girl
thought
this
noise
was
singing
the
girl
filled
the
pitcher
and
set
it
down
by
the
river
bank
then
she
waded
into
the
water
and
stooped
over
the
circle
of
cut
reeds
she
pulled
half
a
dozen
fine
fish
out
of
the
water
within
the
reeds
killing
each
as
she
took
it
out
and
threading
it
on
a
long
osier
that
she
carried
then
she
knotted
the
osier
hung
it
on
her
arm
picked
up
the
pitcher
and
turned
to
come
back
and
as
she
turned
she
saw
the
four
children
the
white
dresses
of
jane
and
anthea
stood
out
like
snow
against
the
dark
forest
background
she
screamed
and
the
pitcher
fell
and
the
water
was
spilled
out
over
the
hard
mud
surface
and
over
the
fish
which
had
fallen
too
then
the
water
slowly
trickled
away
into
the
deep
cracks
don
t
be
frightened
anthea
cried
we
won
t
hurt
who
are
you
said
the
girl
now
once
for
all
i
am
not
going
to
be
bothered
to
tell
you
how
it
was
that
the
girl
could
understand
anthea
and
anthea
could
understand
the
girl
you
at
any
rate
would
not
understand
me
if
i
tried
to
explain
it
any
more
than
you
can
understand
about
time
and
space
being
only
forms
of
thought
you
may
think
what
you
like
perhaps
the
children
had
found
out
the
universal
language
which
everyone
can
understand
and
which
wise
men
so
far
have
not
found
you
will
have
noticed
long
ago
that
they
were
singularly
lucky
children
and
they
may
have
had
this
piece
of
luck
as
well
as
others
or
it
may
have
been
that
but
why
pursue
the
question
further
the
fact
remains
that
in
all
their
adventures
the
inventions
which
we
call
foreign
languages
never
bothered
them
in
the
least
they
could
always
understand
and
be
understood
if
you
can
explain
this
please
do
i
daresay
i
could
understand
your
explanation
though
you
could
never
understand
mine
so
when
the
girl
said
who
are
you
everyone
understood
at
once
and
anthea
replied
we
are
children
just
like
you
don
t
be
frightened
won
t
you
show
us
where
you
live
jane
put
her
face
right
into
the
psammead
s
basket
and
burrowed
her
mouth
into
its
fur
to
whisper
is
it
safe
won
t
they
eat
us
are
they
cannibals
the
psammead
shrugged
its
fur
don
t
make
your
voice
buzz
like
that
it
tickles
my
ears
it
said
rather
crossly
you
can
always
get
back
to
regent
s
park
in
time
if
you
keep
fast
hold
of
the
charm
it
said
the
strange
girl
was
trembling
with
fright
anthea
had
a
bangle
on
her
arm
it
was
a
trumpery
thing
that
pretended
to
be
silver
it
had
a
glass
heart
of
turquoise
blue
hanging
from
it
and
it
was
the
gift
of
the
at
the
fitzroy
street
house
here
said
anthea
this
is
for
you
that
is
to
show
we
will
not
hurt
you
and
if
you
take
it
i
shall
know
that
you
won
t
hurt
the
girl
held
out
her
hand
anthea
slid
the
bangle
over
it
and
the
girl
s
face
lighted
up
with
the
joy
of
possession
come
she
said
looking
lovingly
at
the
bangle
it
is
peace
between
your
house
and
she
picked
up
her
fish
and
pitcher
and
led
the
way
up
the
narrow
path
by
which
she
had
come
and
the
others
followed
this
is
something
like
said
cyril
trying
to
be
brave
yes
said
robert
also
assuming
a
boldness
he
was
far
from
feeling
this
really
and
truly
is
an
adventure
its
being
in
the
past
makes
it
quite
different
from
the
phoenix
and
carpet
the
belt
of
acacia
trees
and
shrubs
mostly
prickly
and
seemed
about
half
a
mile
across
the
path
was
narrow
and
the
wood
dark
at
last
ahead
daylight
shone
through
the
boughs
and
leaves
the
whole
party
suddenly
came
out
of
the
wood
s
shadow
into
the
glare
of
the
sunlight
that
shone
on
a
great
stretch
of
yellow
sand
dotted
with
heaps
of
grey
rocks
where
spiky
cactus
plants
showed
gaudy
crimson
and
pink
flowers
among
their
shabby
leaves
away
to
the
right
was
something
that
looked
like
a
hedge
and
from
beyond
it
blue
smoke
went
up
to
the
bluer
sky
and
over
all
the
sun
shone
till
you
could
hardly
bear
your
clothes
that
is
where
i
live
said
the
girl
pointing
i
won
t
go
whispered
jane
into
the
basket
unless
you
say
it
s
all
the
psammead
ought
to
have
been
touched
by
this
proof
of
confidence
perhaps
however
it
looked
upon
it
as
a
proof
of
doubt
for
it
merely
snarled
if
you
don
t
go
now
i
ll
never
help
you
oh
whispered
anthea
dear
jane
don
t
think
of
father
and
mother
and
all
of
us
getting
our
heart
s
desire
and
we
can
go
back
any
minute
come
on
besides
said
cyril
in
a
low
voice
the
psammead
must
know
there
s
no
danger
or
it
wouldn
t
go
it
s
not
so
over
and
above
brave
itself
come
on
this
jane
at
last
consented
to
do
as
they
got
nearer
to
the
browny
fence
they
saw
that
it
was
a
great
hedge
about
eight
feet
high
made
of
thorn
bushes
what
s
that
for
asked
cyril
to
keep
out
foes
and
wild
beasts
said
the
girl
i
should
think
it
ought
to
too
said
he
why
some
of
the
thorns
are
as
long
as
my
there
was
an
opening
in
the
hedge
and
they
followed
the
girl
through
it
a
little
way
further
on
was
another
hedge
not
so
high
also
of
dry
thorn
bushes
very
prickly
and
and
within
this
was
a
sort
of
village
of
huts
there
were
no
gardens
and
no
roads
just
huts
built
of
wood
and
twigs
and
clay
and
roofed
with
great
dumped
down
anywhere
the
doors
of
these
houses
were
very
low
like
the
doors
of
the
ground
between
them
was
not
paths
or
streets
but
just
yellow
sand
trampled
very
hard
and
smooth
in
the
middle
of
the
village
there
was
a
hedge
that
enclosed
what
seemed
to
be
a
piece
of
ground
about
as
big
as
their
own
garden
in
camden
town
no
sooner
were
the
children
well
within
the
inner
thorn
hedge
than
dozens
of
men
and
women
and
children
came
crowding
round
from
behind
and
inside
the
huts
the
girl
stood
protectingly
in
front
of
the
four
children
and
said
they
are
from
beyond
the
desert
they
bring
marvellous
gifts
and
i
have
said
that
it
is
peace
between
us
and
she
held
out
her
arm
with
the
lowther
arcade
bangle
on
it
the
children
from
london
where
nothing
now
surprises
anyone
had
never
before
seen
so
many
people
look
so
astonished
they
crowded
round
the
children
touching
their
clothes
their
shoes
the
buttons
on
the
boys
jackets
and
the
coral
of
the
girls
necklaces
do
say
something
whispered
anthea
we
come
said
cyril
with
some
dim
remembrance
of
a
dreadful
day
when
he
had
had
to
wait
in
an
outer
office
while
his
father
interviewed
a
solicitor
and
there
had
been
nothing
to
read
but
the
daily
telegraph
we
come
from
the
world
where
the
sun
never
sets
and
peace
with
honour
is
what
we
want
we
are
the
great
or
conquering
race
not
that
we
want
to
conquer
you
he
added
hastily
we
only
want
to
look
at
your
houses
and
your
well
at
all
you
ve
got
here
and
then
we
shall
return
to
our
own
place
and
tell
of
all
that
we
have
seen
so
that
your
name
may
be
cyril
s
speech
didn
t
keep
the
crowd
from
pressing
round
and
looking
as
eagerly
as
ever
at
the
clothing
of
the
children
anthea
had
an
idea
that
these
people
had
never
seen
woven
stuff
before
and
she
saw
how
wonderful
and
strange
it
must
seem
to
people
who
had
never
had
any
clothes
but
the
skins
of
beasts
the
sewing
too
of
modern
clothes
seemed
to
astonish
them
very
much
they
must
have
been
able
to
sew
themselves
by
the
way
for
men
who
seemed
to
be
the
chiefs
wore
knickerbockers
of
or
fastened
round
the
waist
with
twisted
strips
of
hide
and
the
women
wore
long
skimpy
skirts
of
animals
skins
the
people
were
not
very
tall
their
hair
was
fair
and
men
and
women
both
had
it
short
their
eyes
were
blue
and
that
seemed
odd
in
egypt
most
of
them
were
tattooed
like
sailors
only
more
roughly
what
is
this
what
is
this
they
kept
asking
touching
the
children
s
clothes
curiously
anthea
hastily
took
off
jane
s
frilly
lace
collar
and
handed
it
to
the
woman
who
seemed
most
friendly
take
this
she
said
and
look
at
it
and
leave
us
alone
we
want
to
talk
among
she
spoke
in
the
tone
of
authority
which
she
had
always
found
successful
when
she
had
not
time
to
coax
her
baby
brother
to
do
as
he
was
told
the
tone
was
just
as
successful
now
the
children
were
left
together
and
the
crowd
retreated
it
paused
a
dozen
yards
away
to
look
at
the
lace
collar
and
to
go
on
talking
as
hard
as
it
could
the
children
will
never
know
what
those
people
said
though
they
knew
well
enough
that
they
the
four
strangers
were
the
subject
of
the
talk
they
tried
to
comfort
themselves
by
remembering
the
girl
s
promise
of
friendliness
but
of
course
the
thought
of
the
charm
was
more
comfortable
than
anything
else
they
sat
down
on
the
sand
in
the
shadow
of
the
place
in
the
middle
of
the
village
and
now
for
the
first
time
they
were
able
to
look
about
them
and
to
see
something
more
than
a
crowd
of
eager
curious
faces
they
here
noticed
that
the
women
wore
necklaces
made
of
beads
of
different
coloured
stone
and
from
these
hung
pendants
of
odd
strange
shapes
and
some
of
them
had
bracelets
of
ivory
and
flint
i
say
said
robert
what
a
lot
we
could
teach
them
if
we
stayed
here
i
expect
they
could
teach
us
something
too
said
cyril
did
you
notice
that
flint
bracelet
the
woman
had
that
anthea
gave
the
collar
to
that
must
have
taken
some
making
look
here
they
ll
get
suspicious
if
we
talk
among
ourselves
and
i
do
want
to
know
about
how
they
do
things
let
s
get
the
girl
to
show
us
round
and
we
can
be
thinking
about
how
to
get
the
amulet
at
the
same
time
only
mind
we
must
keep
anthea
beckoned
to
the
girl
who
was
standing
a
little
way
off
looking
wistfully
at
them
and
she
came
gladly
tell
us
how
you
make
the
bracelets
the
stone
ones
said
cyril
with
other
stones
said
the
girl
the
men
make
them
we
have
men
of
special
skill
in
such
haven
t
you
any
iron
tools
iron
said
the
girl
i
don
t
know
what
you
it
was
the
first
word
she
had
not
understood
are
all
your
tools
of
flint
asked
cyril
of
course
said
the
girl
opening
her
eyes
wide
i
wish
i
had
time
to
tell
you
of
that
talk
the
english
children
wanted
to
hear
all
about
this
new
place
but
they
also
wanted
to
tell
of
their
own
country
it
was
like
when
you
come
back
from
your
holidays
and
you
want
to
hear
and
to
tell
everything
at
the
same
time
as
the
talk
went
on
there
were
more
and
more
words
that
the
girl
could
not
understand
and
the
children
soon
gave
up
the
attempt
to
explain
to
her
what
their
own
country
was
like
when
they
began
to
see
how
very
few
of
the
things
they
had
always
thought
they
could
not
do
without
were
really
not
at
all
necessary
to
life
the
girl
showed
them
how
the
huts
were
made
indeed
as
one
was
being
made
that
very
day
she
took
them
to
look
at
it
the
way
of
building
was
very
different
from
ours
the
men
stuck
long
pieces
of
wood
into
a
piece
of
ground
the
size
of
the
hut
they
wanted
to
make
these
were
about
eight
inches
apart
then
they
put
in
another
row
about
eight
inches
away
from
the
first
and
then
a
third
row
still
further
out
then
all
the
space
between
was
filled
up
with
small
branches
and
twigs
and
then
daubed
over
with
black
mud
worked
with
the
feet
till
it
was
soft
and
sticky
like
putty
the
girl
told
them
how
the
men
went
hunting
with
flint
spears
and
arrows
and
how
they
made
boats
with
reeds
and
clay
then
she
explained
the
reed
thing
in
the
river
that
she
had
taken
the
fish
out
of
it
was
a
just
a
ring
of
reeds
set
up
in
the
water
with
only
one
little
opening
in
it
and
in
this
opening
just
below
the
water
were
stuck
reeds
slanting
the
way
of
the
river
s
flow
so
that
the
fish
when
they
had
swum
sillily
in
sillily
couldn
t
get
out
again
she
showed
them
the
clay
pots
and
jars
and
platters
some
of
them
ornamented
with
black
and
red
patterns
and
the
most
wonderful
things
made
of
flint
and
different
sorts
of
stone
beads
and
ornaments
and
tools
and
weapons
of
all
sorts
and
kinds
it
is
really
wonderful
said
cyril
patronizingly
when
you
consider
that
it
s
all
eight
thousand
years
ago
i
don
t
understand
you
said
the
girl
it
isn
t
eight
thousand
years
ago
whispered
jane
it
s
now
and
that
s
just
what
i
don
t
like
about
it
i
say
do
let
s
get
home
again
before
anything
more
happens
you
can
see
for
yourselves
the
charm
isn
t
what
s
in
that
place
in
the
middle
asked
anthea
struck
by
a
sudden
thought
and
pointing
to
the
fence
that
s
the
secret
sacred
place
said
the
girl
in
a
whisper
no
one
knows
what
is
there
there
are
many
walls
and
inside
the
insidest
one
it
is
but
no
one
knows
what
it
is
except
the
i
believe
you
know
said
cyril
looking
at
her
very
hard
i
ll
give
you
this
if
you
ll
tell
me
said
anthea
taking
off
a
which
had
already
been
much
admired
yes
said
the
girl
catching
eagerly
at
the
ring
my
father
is
one
of
the
heads
and
i
know
a
water
charm
to
make
him
talk
in
his
sleep
and
he
has
spoken
i
will
tell
you
but
if
they
know
i
have
told
you
they
will
kill
me
in
the
insidest
inside
there
is
a
stone
box
and
in
it
there
is
the
amulet
none
knows
whence
it
came
it
came
from
very
far
have
you
seen
it
asked
anthea
the
girl
nodded
is
it
anything
like
this
asked
jane
rashly
producing
the
charm
the
girl
s
face
turned
a
sickly
hide
it
hide
it
she
whispered
you
must
put
it
back
if
they
see
it
they
will
kill
us
all
you
for
taking
it
and
me
for
knowing
that
there
was
such
a
thing
oh
woe
woe
why
did
you
ever
come
here
don
t
be
frightened
said
cyril
they
shan
t
know
jane
don
t
you
be
such
a
little
again
that
s
all
you
see
what
will
happen
if
you
do
now
tell
me
he
turned
to
the
girl
but
before
he
had
time
to
speak
the
question
there
was
a
loud
shout
and
a
man
bounded
in
through
the
opening
in
the
many
foes
are
upon
us
he
cried
make
ready
the
defences
his
breath
only
served
for
that
and
he
lay
panting
on
the
ground
oh
do
let
s
go
home
said
jane
look
here
i
don
t
care
i
will
she
held
up
the
charm
fortunately
all
the
strange
fair
people
were
too
busy
to
notice
her
she
held
up
the
charm
and
nothing
happened
you
haven
t
said
the
word
of
power
said
anthea
jane
hastily
said
it
and
still
nothing
happened
hold
it
up
towards
the
east
you
silly
said
robert
which
is
the
east
said
jane
dancing
about
in
her
agony
of
terror
nobody
knew
so
they
opened
the
to
ask
the
psammead
and
the
bag
had
only
a
waterproof
sheet
in
it
the
psammead
was
gone
hide
the
sacred
thing
hide
it
hide
it
whispered
the
girl
cyril
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
tried
to
look
as
brave
as
he
knew
he
ought
to
feel
hide
it
up
pussy
he
said
we
are
in
for
it
now
we
ve
just
got
to
stay
and
see
it
chapter
the
fight
in
the
village
here
was
a
horrible
position
four
english
children
whose
proper
date
was
and
whose
proper
address
was
london
set
down
in
egypt
in
the
year
with
no
means
whatever
of
getting
back
into
their
own
time
and
place
they
could
not
find
the
east
and
the
sun
was
of
no
use
at
the
moment
because
some
officious
person
had
once
explained
to
cyril
that
the
sun
did
not
really
set
in
the
west
at
all
nor
rise
in
the
east
either
for
the
matter
of
that
the
psammead
had
crept
out
of
the
when
they
were
not
looking
and
had
basely
deserted
them
an
enemy
was
approaching
there
would
be
a
fight
people
get
killed
in
fights
and
the
idea
of
taking
part
in
a
fight
was
one
that
did
not
appeal
to
the
children
the
man
who
had
brought
the
news
of
the
enemy
still
lay
panting
on
the
sand
his
tongue
was
hanging
out
long
and
red
like
a
dog
s
the
people
of
the
village
were
hurriedly
filling
the
gaps
in
the
fence
with
from
the
heap
that
seemed
to
have
been
piled
there
ready
for
just
such
a
need
they
lifted
the
with
long
poles
much
as
men
at
home
nowadays
lift
hay
with
a
fork
jane
bit
her
lip
and
tried
to
decide
not
to
cry
robert
felt
in
his
pocket
for
a
toy
pistol
and
loaded
it
with
a
pink
paper
cap
it
was
his
only
weapon
cyril
tightened
his
belt
two
holes
and
anthea
absently
took
the
drooping
red
roses
from
the
buttonholes
of
the
others
bit
the
ends
of
the
stalks
and
set
them
in
a
pot
of
water
that
stood
in
the
shadow
by
a
hut
door
she
was
always
rather
silly
about
flowers
look
here
she
said
i
think
perhaps
the
psammead
is
really
arranging
something
for
us
i
don
t
believe
it
would
go
away
and
leave
us
all
alone
in
the
past
i
m
certain
it
wouldn
jane
succeeded
in
deciding
not
to
cry
at
any
rate
yet
but
what
can
we
do
robert
asked
nothing
cyril
answered
promptly
except
keep
our
eyes
and
ears
open
look
that
runner
chap
s
getting
his
wind
let
s
go
and
hear
what
he
s
got
to
the
runner
had
risen
to
his
knees
and
was
sitting
back
on
his
heels
now
he
stood
up
and
spoke
he
began
by
some
respectful
remarks
addressed
to
the
heads
of
the
village
his
speech
got
more
interesting
when
he
said
i
went
out
in
my
raft
to
snare
ibises
and
i
had
gone
up
the
stream
an
hour
s
journey
then
i
set
my
snares
and
waited
and
i
heard
the
sound
of
many
wings
and
looking
up
saw
many
herons
circling
in
the
air
and
i
saw
that
they
were
afraid
so
i
took
thought
a
beast
may
scare
one
heron
coming
upon
it
suddenly
but
no
beast
will
scare
a
whole
flock
of
herons
and
still
they
flew
and
circled
and
would
not
light
so
then
i
knew
that
what
scared
the
herons
must
be
men
and
men
who
knew
not
our
ways
of
going
softly
so
as
to
take
the
birds
and
beasts
unawares
by
this
i
knew
they
were
not
of
our
race
or
of
our
place
so
leaving
my
raft
i
crept
along
the
river
bank
and
at
last
came
upon
the
strangers
they
are
many
as
the
sands
of
the
desert
and
their
shine
red
like
the
sun
they
are
a
terrible
people
and
their
march
is
towards
us
having
seen
this
i
ran
and
did
not
stay
till
i
was
before
these
are
your
folk
said
the
headman
turning
suddenly
and
angrily
on
cyril
you
came
as
spies
for
we
did
not
said
cyril
indignantly
we
wouldn
t
be
spies
for
anything
i
m
certain
these
people
aren
t
a
bit
like
us
are
they
now
he
asked
the
runner
no
was
the
answer
these
men
s
faces
were
darkened
and
their
hair
black
as
night
yet
these
strange
children
maybe
are
their
gods
who
have
come
before
to
make
ready
the
way
for
a
murmur
ran
through
the
crowd
no
no
said
cyril
again
we
are
on
your
side
we
will
help
you
to
guard
your
sacred
the
headman
seemed
impressed
by
the
fact
that
cyril
knew
that
there
were
sacred
things
to
be
guarded
he
stood
a
moment
gazing
at
the
children
then
he
said
it
is
well
and
now
let
all
make
offering
that
we
may
be
strong
in
the
crowd
dispersed
and
nine
men
wearing
grouped
themselves
in
front
of
the
opening
in
the
hedge
in
the
middle
of
the
village
and
presently
one
by
one
the
men
brought
all
sorts
of
things
hippopotamus
flesh
the
fruit
of
the
date
palms
red
chalk
green
chalk
fish
from
the
river
and
ibex
from
the
mountains
and
the
headman
received
these
gifts
there
was
another
hedge
inside
the
first
about
a
yard
from
it
so
that
there
was
a
lane
inside
between
the
hedges
and
every
now
and
then
one
of
the
headmen
would
disappear
along
this
lane
with
full
hands
and
come
back
with
hands
empty
they
re
making
offerings
to
their
amulet
said
anthea
we
d
better
give
something
the
pockets
of
the
party
hastily
explored
yielded
a
piece
of
pink
tape
a
bit
of
and
part
of
the
waterbury
watch
that
robert
had
not
been
able
to
help
taking
to
pieces
at
christmas
and
had
never
had
time
to
rearrange
most
boys
have
a
watch
in
this
condition
they
presented
their
offerings
and
anthea
added
the
red
roses
the
headman
who
took
the
things
looked
at
them
with
awe
especially
at
the
red
roses
and
the
fragment
this
is
a
day
of
very
wondrous
happenings
he
said
i
have
no
more
room
in
me
to
be
astonished
our
maiden
said
there
was
peace
between
you
and
us
but
for
this
coming
of
a
foe
we
should
have
made
the
children
shuddered
now
speak
are
you
upon
our
side
yes
don
t
i
keep
telling
you
we
are
robert
said
look
here
i
will
give
you
a
sign
you
see
he
held
out
the
toy
pistol
i
shall
speak
to
it
and
if
it
answers
me
you
will
know
that
i
and
the
others
are
come
to
guard
your
sacred
thing
that
we
ve
just
made
the
offerings
will
that
god
whose
image
you
hold
in
your
hand
speak
to
you
alone
or
shall
i
also
hear
it
asked
the
man
cautiously
you
ll
be
surprised
when
you
do
hear
it
said
robert
now
he
looked
at
the
pistol
and
said
if
we
are
to
guard
the
sacred
treasure
within
he
pointed
to
the
space
speak
with
thy
loud
voice
and
we
shall
he
pulled
the
trigger
and
the
cap
went
off
the
noise
was
loud
for
it
was
a
pistol
and
the
caps
were
excellent
every
man
woman
and
child
in
the
village
fell
on
its
face
on
the
sand
the
headman
who
had
accepted
the
test
rose
first
the
voice
has
spoken
he
said
lead
them
into
the
of
the
sacred
so
now
the
four
children
were
led
in
through
the
opening
of
the
hedge
and
round
the
lane
till
they
came
to
an
opening
in
the
inner
hedge
and
they
went
through
an
opening
in
that
and
so
passed
into
another
lane
the
thing
was
built
something
like
this
and
all
the
hedges
were
of
brushwood
and
thorns
drawing
of
maze
omitted
it
s
like
the
maze
at
hampton
court
whispered
anthea
the
lanes
were
all
open
to
the
sky
but
the
little
hut
in
the
middle
of
the
maze
was
and
a
curtain
of
skins
hung
over
the
doorway
here
you
may
wait
said
their
guide
but
do
not
dare
to
pass
the
he
himself
passed
it
and
disappeared
but
look
here
whispered
cyril
some
of
us
ought
to
be
outside
in
case
the
psammead
turns
don
t
let
s
get
separated
from
each
other
whatever
we
do
said
anthea
it
s
quite
bad
enough
to
be
separated
from
the
psammead
we
can
t
do
anything
while
that
man
is
in
there
let
s
all
go
out
into
the
village
again
we
can
come
back
later
now
we
know
the
way
in
that
man
ll
have
to
fight
like
the
rest
most
likely
if
it
comes
to
fighting
if
we
find
the
psammead
we
ll
go
straight
home
it
must
be
getting
late
and
i
don
t
much
like
this
mazy
they
went
out
and
told
the
headman
that
they
would
protect
the
treasure
when
the
fighting
began
and
now
they
looked
about
them
and
were
able
to
see
exactly
how
a
worker
in
flint
flakes
and
notches
an
or
the
edge
of
an
axe
an
advantage
which
no
other
person
now
alive
has
ever
enjoyed
the
boys
found
the
weapons
most
interesting
the
were
not
on
arrows
such
as
you
shoot
from
a
bow
but
on
javelins
for
throwing
from
the
hand
the
chief
weapon
was
a
stone
fastened
to
a
rather
short
stick
something
like
the
things
gentlemen
used
to
carry
about
and
call
in
the
days
of
the
garrotters
then
there
were
long
things
like
spears
or
lances
with
flint
knives
horribly
sharp
and
flint
everyone
in
the
village
was
so
busy
that
the
place
was
like
an
when
you
have
walked
into
it
by
accident
the
women
were
busy
and
even
the
children
quite
suddenly
all
the
air
seemed
to
glow
and
grow
red
it
was
like
the
sudden
opening
of
a
furnace
door
such
as
you
may
see
at
woolwich
arsenal
if
you
ever
have
the
luck
to
be
taken
there
and
then
almost
as
suddenly
it
was
as
though
the
furnace
doors
had
been
shut
for
the
sun
had
set
and
it
was
night
the
sun
had
that
abrupt
way
of
setting
in
egypt
eight
thousand
years
ago
and
i
believe
it
has
never
been
able
to
break
itself
of
the
habit
and
sets
in
exactly
the
same
manner
to
the
present
day
the
girl
brought
the
skins
of
wild
deer
and
led
the
children
to
a
heap
of
dry
sedge
my
father
says
they
will
not
attack
yet
sleep
she
said
and
it
really
seemed
a
good
idea
you
may
think
that
in
the
midst
of
all
these
dangers
the
children
would
not
have
been
able
to
sleep
but
somehow
though
they
were
rather
frightened
now
and
then
the
feeling
was
growing
in
them
deep
down
and
almost
hidden
away
but
still
growing
that
the
psammead
was
to
be
trusted
and
that
they
were
really
and
truly
safe
this
did
not
prevent
their
being
quite
as
much
frightened
as
they
could
bear
to
be
without
being
perfectly
miserable
i
suppose
we
d
better
go
to
sleep
said
robert
i
don
t
know
what
on
earth
poor
old
nurse
will
do
with
us
out
all
night
set
the
police
on
our
tracks
i
expect
i
only
wish
they
could
find
us
a
dozen
policemen
would
be
rather
welcome
just
now
but
it
s
no
use
getting
into
a
stew
over
it
he
added
soothingly
good
and
they
all
fell
asleep
they
were
awakened
by
long
loud
terrible
sounds
that
seemed
to
come
from
everywhere
at
once
horrible
threatening
shouts
and
shrieks
and
howls
that
sounded
as
cyril
said
later
like
the
voices
of
men
thirsting
for
their
enemies
blood
it
is
the
voice
of
the
strange
men
said
the
girl
coming
to
them
trembling
through
the
dark
they
have
attacked
the
walls
and
the
thorns
have
driven
them
back
my
father
says
they
will
not
try
again
till
daylight
but
they
are
shouting
to
frighten
us
as
though
we
were
savages
dwellers
in
the
swamps
she
cried
indignantly
all
night
the
terrible
noise
went
on
but
when
the
sun
rose
as
abruptly
as
he
had
set
the
sound
suddenly
ceased
the
children
had
hardly
time
to
be
glad
of
this
before
a
shower
of
javelins
came
hurtling
over
the
great
and
everyone
sheltered
behind
the
huts
but
next
moment
another
shower
of
weapons
came
from
the
opposite
side
and
the
crowd
rushed
to
other
shelter
cyril
pulled
out
a
javelin
that
had
stuck
in
the
roof
of
the
hut
beside
him
its
head
was
of
brightly
burnished
copper
then
the
sound
of
shouting
arose
again
and
the
crackle
of
dried
thorns
the
enemy
was
breaking
down
the
hedge
all
the
villagers
swarmed
to
the
point
whence
the
crackling
and
the
shouting
came
they
hurled
stones
over
the
hedges
and
short
arrows
with
flint
heads
the
children
had
never
before
seen
men
with
the
fighting
light
in
their
eyes
it
was
very
strange
and
terrible
and
gave
you
a
queer
thick
feeling
in
your
throat
it
was
quite
different
from
the
pictures
of
fights
in
the
illustrated
papers
at
home
it
seemed
that
the
shower
of
stones
had
driven
back
the
besiegers
the
besieged
drew
breath
but
at
that
moment
the
shouting
and
the
crackling
arose
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
village
and
the
crowd
hastened
to
defend
that
point
and
so
the
fight
swayed
to
and
fro
across
the
village
for
the
besieged
had
not
the
sense
to
divide
their
forces
as
their
enemies
had
done
cyril
noticed
that
every
now
and
then
certain
of
the
would
enter
the
maze
and
come
out
with
brighter
faces
a
braver
aspect
and
a
more
upright
carriage
i
believe
they
go
and
touch
the
amulet
he
said
you
know
the
psammead
said
it
could
make
people
they
crept
through
the
maze
and
watching
they
saw
that
cyril
was
right
a
headman
was
standing
in
front
of
the
skin
curtain
and
as
the
warriors
came
before
him
he
murmured
a
word
they
could
not
hear
and
touched
their
foreheads
with
something
that
they
could
not
see
and
this
something
he
held
in
his
hands
and
through
his
fingers
they
saw
the
gleam
of
a
red
stone
that
they
knew
the
fight
raged
across
the
outside
suddenly
there
was
a
loud
and
bitter
cry
they
re
in
they
re
in
the
hedge
is
down
the
headman
disappeared
behind
the
curtain
he
s
gone
to
hide
it
said
anthea
oh
psammead
dear
how
could
you
leave
us
suddenly
there
was
a
shriek
from
inside
the
hut
and
the
headman
staggered
out
white
with
fear
and
fled
out
through
the
maze
the
children
were
as
white
as
he
oh
what
is
it
what
is
it
moaned
anthea
oh
psammead
how
could
you
how
could
you
and
the
sound
of
the
fight
sank
breathlessly
and
swelled
fiercely
all
around
it
was
like
the
rising
and
falling
of
the
waves
of
the
sea
anthea
shuddered
and
said
again
oh
psammead
psammead
well
said
a
brisk
voice
and
the
curtain
of
skins
was
lifted
at
one
corner
by
a
furry
hand
and
out
peeped
the
bat
s
ears
and
snail
s
eyes
of
the
psammead
anthea
caught
it
in
her
arms
and
a
sigh
of
desperate
relief
was
breathed
by
each
of
the
four
oh
which
is
the
east
anthea
said
and
she
spoke
hurriedly
for
the
noise
of
wild
fighting
drew
nearer
and
nearer
don
t
choke
me
said
the
psammead
come
the
inside
of
the
hut
was
pitch
dark
i
ve
got
a
match
said
cyril
and
struck
it
the
floor
of
the
hut
was
of
soft
loose
sand
i
ve
been
asleep
here
said
the
psammead
most
comfortable
it
s
been
the
best
sand
i
ve
had
for
a
month
it
s
all
right
everything
s
all
right
i
knew
your
only
chance
would
be
while
the
fight
was
going
on
that
man
won
t
come
back
i
bit
him
and
he
thinks
i
m
an
evil
spirit
now
you
ve
only
got
to
take
the
thing
and
the
hut
was
hung
with
skins
heaped
in
the
middle
were
the
offerings
that
had
been
given
the
night
before
anthea
s
roses
fading
on
the
top
of
the
heap
at
one
side
of
the
hut
stood
a
large
square
stone
block
and
on
it
an
oblong
box
of
earthenware
with
strange
figures
of
men
and
beasts
on
it
is
the
thing
in
there
asked
cyril
as
the
psammead
pointed
a
skinny
finger
at
it
you
must
judge
of
that
said
the
psammead
the
man
was
just
going
to
bury
the
box
in
the
sand
when
i
jumped
out
at
him
and
bit
light
another
match
robert
said
anthea
now
then
quick
which
is
the
east
why
where
the
sun
rises
of
course
but
someone
told
us
oh
they
ll
tell
you
anything
said
the
psammead
impatiently
getting
into
its
and
wrapping
itself
in
its
waterproof
sheet
but
we
can
t
see
the
sun
in
here
and
it
isn
t
rising
anyhow
said
jane
how
you
do
waste
time
the
psammead
said
why
the
east
s
where
the
shrine
is
of
course
there
it
pointed
to
the
great
stone
and
still
the
shouting
and
the
clash
of
stone
on
metal
sounded
nearer
and
nearer
the
children
could
hear
that
the
headmen
had
surrounded
the
hut
to
protect
their
treasure
as
long
as
might
be
from
the
enemy
but
none
dare
to
come
in
after
the
psammead
s
sudden
fierce
biting
of
the
headman
now
jane
said
cyril
very
quickly
i
ll
take
the
amulet
you
stand
ready
to
hold
up
the
charm
and
be
sure
you
don
t
let
it
go
as
you
come
he
made
a
step
forward
but
at
that
instant
a
great
crackling
overhead
ended
in
a
blaze
of
sunlight
the
roof
had
been
broken
in
at
one
side
and
great
slabs
of
it
were
being
lifted
off
by
two
spears
as
the
children
trembled
and
winked
in
the
new
light
large
dark
hands
tore
down
the
wall
and
a
dark
face
with
a
blobby
fat
nose
looked
over
the
gap
even
at
that
awful
moment
anthea
had
time
to
think
that
it
was
very
like
the
face
of
mr
jacob
absalom
who
had
sold
them
the
charm
in
the
shop
near
charing
cross
here
is
their
amulet
cried
a
harsh
strange
voice
it
is
this
that
makes
them
strong
to
fight
and
brave
to
die
and
what
else
have
we
here
gods
or
demons
he
glared
fiercely
at
the
children
and
the
whites
of
his
eyes
were
very
white
indeed
he
had
a
wet
red
copper
knife
in
his
teeth
there
was
not
a
moment
to
lose
jane
jane
quick
cried
everyone
passionately
jane
with
trembling
hands
held
up
the
charm
towards
the
east
and
cyril
spoke
the
word
of
power
the
amulet
grew
to
a
great
arch
out
beyond
it
was
the
glaring
egyptian
sky
the
broken
wall
the
cruel
dark
face
with
the
red
wet
knife
in
its
gleaming
teeth
within
the
arch
was
the
dull
faint
of
london
grass
and
trees
hold
tight
jane
cyril
cried
and
he
dashed
through
the
arch
dragging
anthea
and
the
psammead
after
him
robert
followed
clutching
jane
and
in
the
ears
of
each
as
they
passed
through
the
arch
of
the
charm
the
sound
and
fury
of
battle
died
out
suddenly
and
utterly
and
they
heard
only
the
low
dull
discontented
hum
of
vast
london
and
the
peeking
and
patting
of
the
sparrows
on
the
gravel
and
the
voices
of
the
ragged
baby
children
playing
on
the
yellow
trampled
grass
and
the
charm
was
a
little
charm
again
in
jane
s
hand
and
there
was
the
basket
with
their
dinner
and
the
bathbuns
lying
just
where
they
had
left
it
my
hat
said
cyril
drawing
a
long
breath
that
was
something
like
an
it
was
rather
like
one
certainly
said
the
psammead
they
all
lay
still
breathing
in
the
safe
quiet
air
of
regent
s
park
we
d
better
go
home
at
once
said
anthea
presently
old
nurse
will
be
most
frightfully
anxious
the
sun
looks
about
the
same
as
it
did
when
we
started
yesterday
we
ve
been
away
the
buns
are
quite
soft
still
said
cyril
feeling
one
i
suppose
the
dew
kept
them
they
were
not
hungry
curiously
enough
they
picked
up
the
and
the
and
went
straight
home
old
nurse
met
them
with
amazement
well
if
ever
i
did
she
said
what
s
gone
wrong
you
ve
soon
tired
of
your
the
children
took
this
to
be
bitter
irony
which
means
saying
the
exact
opposite
of
what
you
mean
in
order
to
make
yourself
disagreeable
as
when
you
happen
to
have
a
dirty
face
and
someone
says
how
nice
and
clean
you
look
we
re
very
sorry
began
anthea
but
old
nurse
said
oh
bless
me
child
i
don
t
care
please
yourselves
and
you
ll
please
me
come
in
and
get
your
dinners
comf
table
i
ve
got
a
potato
on
when
she
had
gone
to
attend
to
the
potatoes
the
children
looked
at
each
other
could
it
be
that
old
nurse
had
so
changed
that
she
no
longer
cared
that
they
should
have
been
away
from
home
for
hours
all
night
in
fact
without
any
explanation
whatever
but
the
psammead
put
its
head
out
of
its
basket
and
said
what
s
the
matter
don
t
you
understand
you
come
back
through
the
at
the
same
time
as
you
go
through
it
this
isn
t
tomorrow
is
it
still
yesterday
asked
jane
no
it
s
today
the
same
as
it
s
always
been
it
wouldn
t
do
to
go
mixing
up
the
present
and
the
past
and
cutting
bits
out
of
one
to
fit
into
the
then
all
that
adventure
took
no
time
at
all
you
can
call
it
that
if
you
like
said
the
psammead
it
took
none
of
the
modern
time
that
evening
anthea
carried
up
a
steak
for
the
learned
gentleman
s
dinner
she
persuaded
beatrice
the
who
had
given
her
the
bangle
with
the
blue
stone
to
let
her
do
it
and
she
stayed
and
talked
to
him
by
special
invitation
while
he
ate
the
dinner
she
told
him
the
whole
adventure
beginning
with
this
afternoon
we
found
ourselves
on
the
bank
of
the
river
nile
and
ending
up
with
and
then
we
remembered
how
to
get
back
and
there
we
were
in
regent
s
park
and
it
hadn
t
taken
any
time
at
she
did
not
tell
anything
about
the
charm
or
the
psammead
because
that
was
forbidden
but
the
story
was
quite
wonderful
enough
even
as
it
was
to
entrance
the
learned
gentleman
you
are
a
most
unusual
little
girl
he
said
who
tells
you
all
these
things
no
one
said
anthea
they
just
he
said
slowly
as
one
who
recalls
and
pronounces
a
word
he
sat
long
after
she
had
left
him
at
last
he
roused
himself
with
a
start
i
really
must
take
a
holiday
he
said
my
nerves
must
be
all
out
of
order
i
actually
have
a
perfectly
distinct
impression
that
the
little
girl
from
the
rooms
below
came
in
and
gave
me
a
coherent
and
graphic
picture
of
life
as
i
conceive
it
to
have
been
in
egypt
strange
what
tricks
the
mind
will
play
i
shall
have
to
be
more
he
finished
his
bread
conscientiously
and
actually
went
for
a
mile
walk
before
he
went
back
to
his
work
chapter
the
way
to
babylon
how
many
miles
to
babylon
three
score
and
ten
can
i
get
there
by
candle
light
yes
and
back
again
jane
was
singing
to
her
doll
rocking
it
to
and
fro
in
the
house
which
she
had
made
for
herself
and
it
the
roof
of
the
house
was
the
and
the
walls
were
tablecloths
and
antimacassars
hanging
all
round
and
kept
in
their
places
by
books
laid
on
their
top
ends
at
the
table
edge
the
others
were
tasting
the
fearful
joys
of
domestic
tobogganing
you
know
how
it
is
done
with
the
largest
and
best
and
the
surface
of
the
stair
carpet
it
is
best
to
do
it
on
the
days
when
the
stair
rods
are
being
cleaned
and
the
carpet
is
only
held
by
the
nails
at
the
top
of
course
it
is
one
of
the
five
or
six
thoroughly
games
that
people
are
so
unjust
to
and
old
nurse
though
a
brick
in
many
respects
was
quite
enough
of
a
standard
to
put
her
foot
down
on
the
tobogganing
long
before
any
of
the
performers
had
had
half
enough
of
it
the
was
taken
away
and
the
baffled
party
entered
the
in
exactly
the
mood
not
to
be
pleased
if
they
could
help
it
so
cyril
said
what
a
beastly
mess
and
robert
added
do
shut
up
jane
even
anthea
who
was
almost
always
kind
advised
jane
to
try
another
song
i
m
sick
to
death
of
that
said
she
it
was
a
wet
day
so
none
of
the
plans
for
seeing
all
the
sights
of
london
that
can
be
seen
for
nothing
could
be
carried
out
everyone
had
been
thinking
all
the
morning
about
the
wonderful
adventures
of
the
day
before
when
jane
had
held
up
the
charm
and
it
had
turned
into
an
arch
through
which
they
had
walked
straight
out
of
the
present
time
and
the
regent
s
park
into
the
land
of
egypt
eight
thousand
years
ago
the
memory
of
yesterday
s
happenings
was
still
extremely
fresh
and
frightening
so
that
everyone
hoped
that
no
one
would
suggest
another
excursion
into
the
past
for
it
seemed
to
all
that
yesterday
s
adventures
were
quite
enough
to
last
for
at
least
a
week
yet
each
felt
a
little
anxious
that
the
others
should
not
think
it
was
afraid
and
presently
cyril
who
really
was
not
a
coward
began
to
see
that
it
would
not
be
at
all
nice
if
he
should
have
to
think
himself
one
so
he
said
i
say
about
that
charm
jane
come
out
we
ought
to
talk
about
it
oh
if
that
s
all
said
robert
jane
obediently
wriggled
to
the
front
of
her
house
and
sat
there
she
felt
for
the
charm
to
make
sure
that
it
was
still
round
her
neck
it
isn
t
all
said
cyril
saying
much
more
than
he
meant
because
he
thought
robert
s
tone
had
been
rude
as
indeed
it
had
we
ought
to
go
and
look
for
that
amulet
what
s
the
good
of
having
a
charm
and
keeping
it
idle
just
eating
its
head
off
in
the
i
m
game
for
anything
of
course
said
robert
but
he
added
with
a
fine
air
of
chivalry
only
i
don
t
think
the
girls
are
keen
today
oh
yes
i
am
said
anthea
hurriedly
if
you
think
i
m
afraid
i
m
i
am
though
said
jane
heavily
i
didn
t
like
it
and
i
won
t
go
there
again
not
for
anything
i
won
we
shouldn
t
go
there
again
silly
said
cyril
it
would
be
some
other
i
daresay
a
place
with
lions
and
tigers
in
it
as
likely
as
seeing
jane
so
frightened
made
the
others
feel
quite
brave
they
said
they
were
certain
they
ought
to
go
it
s
so
ungrateful
to
the
psammead
not
to
anthea
added
a
little
primly
jane
stood
up
she
was
desperate
i
won
t
she
cried
i
won
t
i
won
t
i
won
t
if
you
make
me
i
ll
scream
and
i
ll
scream
and
i
ll
tell
old
nurse
and
i
ll
get
her
to
burn
the
charm
in
the
kitchen
fire
so
now
then
you
can
imagine
how
furious
everyone
was
with
jane
for
feeling
what
each
of
them
had
felt
all
the
morning
in
each
breast
the
same
thought
arose
no
one
can
say
it
s
our
and
they
at
once
began
to
show
jane
how
angry
they
all
felt
that
all
the
fault
was
hers
this
made
them
feel
quite
brave
tit
its
tongue
shall
be
split
and
all
the
dogs
in
our
town
shall
have
a
little
bit
sang
robert
it
s
always
the
way
if
you
have
girls
in
cyril
spoke
in
a
cold
displeasure
that
was
worse
than
robert
s
cruel
quotation
and
even
anthea
said
well
i
m
not
afraid
if
i
am
a
girl
which
of
course
was
the
most
cutting
thing
of
all
jane
picked
up
her
doll
and
faced
the
others
with
what
is
sometimes
called
the
courage
of
despair
i
don
t
care
she
said
i
won
t
so
there
it
s
just
silly
going
to
places
when
you
don
t
want
to
and
when
you
don
t
know
what
they
re
going
to
be
like
you
can
laugh
at
me
as
much
as
you
like
you
re
beasts
and
i
hate
you
all
with
these
awful
words
she
went
out
and
banged
the
door
then
the
others
would
not
look
at
each
other
and
they
did
not
feel
so
brave
as
they
had
done
cyril
took
up
a
book
but
it
was
not
interesting
to
read
robert
kicked
a
absently
his
feet
were
always
eloquent
in
moments
of
emotion
anthea
stood
pleating
the
end
of
the
tablecloth
into
folds
she
seemed
earnestly
anxious
to
get
all
the
pleats
the
same
size
the
sound
of
jane
s
sobs
had
died
away
suddenly
anthea
said
oh
let
it
be
pax
poor
little
pussy
you
know
she
s
the
she
called
us
beasts
said
robert
kicking
the
chair
suddenly
well
said
cyril
who
was
subject
to
passing
fits
of
justice
we
began
you
know
at
least
you
cyril
s
justice
was
always
uncompromising
i
m
not
going
to
say
i
m
sorry
if
you
mean
that
said
robert
and
the
cracked
to
the
kick
he
gave
as
he
said
it
oh
do
let
s
said
anthea
we
re
three
to
one
and
mother
does
so
hate
it
if
we
row
come
on
i
ll
say
i
m
sorry
first
though
i
didn
t
say
anything
all
right
let
s
get
it
over
said
cyril
opening
the
hi
you
pussy
far
away
up
the
stairs
a
voice
could
be
heard
singing
brokenly
but
still
defiantly
how
many
miles
sniff
to
babylon
three
score
and
ten
sniff
can
i
get
there
by
candle
light
yes
sniff
and
back
again
it
was
trying
for
this
was
plainly
meant
to
annoy
but
anthea
would
not
give
herself
time
to
think
this
she
led
the
way
up
the
stairs
taking
three
at
a
time
and
bounded
to
the
level
of
jane
who
sat
on
the
top
step
of
all
thumping
her
doll
to
the
tune
of
the
song
she
was
trying
to
sing
i
say
pussy
let
it
be
pax
we
re
sorry
if
you
are
it
was
enough
the
kiss
of
peace
was
given
by
all
jane
being
the
youngest
was
entitled
to
this
ceremonial
anthea
added
a
special
apology
of
her
own
i
m
sorry
if
i
was
a
pig
pussy
dear
she
said
especially
because
in
my
really
and
truly
inside
mind
i
ve
been
feeling
a
little
as
if
i
d
rather
not
go
into
the
past
again
either
but
then
do
think
if
we
don
t
go
we
shan
t
get
the
amulet
and
oh
pussy
think
if
we
could
only
get
father
and
mother
and
the
lamb
safe
back
we
must
go
but
we
ll
wait
a
day
or
two
if
you
like
and
then
perhaps
you
ll
feel
raw
meat
makes
you
brave
however
cowardly
you
are
said
robert
to
show
that
there
was
now
no
and
cranberries
that
s
what
tartars
eat
and
they
re
so
brave
it
s
simply
awful
i
suppose
cranberries
are
only
for
christmas
time
but
i
ll
ask
old
nurse
to
let
you
have
your
chop
very
raw
if
you
i
think
i
could
be
brave
without
that
said
jane
hastily
she
hated
underdone
meat
i
ll
at
this
moment
the
door
of
the
learned
gentleman
s
room
opened
and
he
looked
out
excuse
me
he
said
in
that
gentle
polite
weary
voice
of
his
but
was
i
mistaken
in
thinking
that
i
caught
a
familiar
word
just
now
were
you
not
singing
some
old
ballad
of
babylon
no
said
robert
at
least
jane
was
singing
how
many
miles
but
i
shouldn
t
have
thought
you
could
have
heard
the
words
for
he
would
have
said
for
the
sniffing
but
anthea
pinched
him
just
in
time
i
did
not
hear
all
the
words
said
the
learned
gentleman
i
wonder
would
you
recite
them
to
me
so
they
all
said
together
how
many
miles
to
babylon
three
score
and
ten
can
i
get
there
by
candle
light
yes
and
back
again
i
wish
one
could
the
learned
gentleman
said
with
a
sigh
can
t
you
asked
jane
babylon
has
fallen
he
answered
with
a
sigh
you
know
it
was
once
a
great
and
beautiful
city
and
the
centre
of
learning
and
art
and
now
it
is
only
ruins
and
so
covered
up
with
earth
that
people
are
not
even
agreed
as
to
where
it
once
he
was
leaning
on
the
banisters
and
his
eyes
had
a
look
in
them
as
though
he
could
see
through
the
staircase
window
the
splendour
and
glory
of
ancient
babylon
i
say
cyril
remarked
abruptly
you
know
that
charm
we
showed
you
and
you
told
us
how
to
say
the
name
that
s
on
it
yes
well
do
you
think
that
charm
was
ever
in
babylon
it
s
quite
possible
the
learned
gentleman
replied
such
charms
have
been
found
in
very
early
egyptian
tombs
yet
their
origin
has
not
been
accurately
determined
as
egyptian
they
may
have
been
brought
from
asia
or
supposing
the
charm
to
have
been
fashioned
in
egypt
it
might
very
well
have
been
carried
to
babylon
by
some
friendly
embassy
or
brought
back
by
the
babylonish
army
from
some
egyptian
campaign
as
part
of
the
spoils
of
war
the
inscription
may
be
much
later
than
the
charm
oh
yes
it
is
a
pleasant
fancy
that
that
splendid
specimen
of
yours
was
once
used
amid
babylonish
the
others
looked
at
each
other
but
it
was
jane
who
spoke
were
the
babylon
people
savages
were
they
always
fighting
and
throwing
things
about
for
she
had
read
the
thoughts
of
the
others
by
the
unerring
light
of
her
own
fears
the
babylonians
were
certainly
more
gentle
than
the
assyrians
said
the
learned
gentleman
and
they
were
not
savages
by
any
means
a
very
high
level
of
culture
he
looked
doubtfully
at
his
audience
and
went
on
i
mean
that
they
made
beautiful
statues
and
jewellery
and
built
splendid
palaces
and
they
were
very
learned
they
had
glorious
libraries
and
high
towers
for
the
purpose
of
astrological
and
astronomical
er
said
robert
i
mean
for
and
said
the
learned
gentleman
and
there
were
temples
and
beautiful
hanging
gardens
i
ll
go
to
babylon
if
you
like
said
jane
abruptly
and
the
others
hastened
to
say
done
before
she
should
have
time
to
change
her
mind
ah
said
the
learned
gentleman
smiling
rather
sadly
one
can
go
so
far
in
dreams
when
one
is
he
sighed
again
and
then
adding
with
a
laboured
briskness
i
hope
you
ll
have
a
a
jolly
game
he
went
into
his
room
and
shut
the
door
he
said
jolly
as
if
it
was
a
foreign
language
said
cyril
come
on
let
s
get
the
psammead
and
go
now
i
think
babylon
seems
a
most
frightfully
jolly
place
to
go
so
they
woke
the
psammead
and
put
it
in
its
with
the
waterproof
sheet
in
case
of
inclement
weather
in
babylon
it
was
very
cross
but
it
said
it
would
as
soon
go
to
babylon
as
anywhere
else
the
sand
is
good
thereabouts
it
added
then
jane
held
up
the
charm
and
cyril
said
we
want
to
go
to
babylon
to
look
for
the
part
of
you
that
was
lost
will
you
please
let
us
go
there
through
you
please
put
us
down
just
outside
said
jane
hastily
and
then
if
we
don
t
like
it
we
needn
t
go
don
t
be
all
day
said
the
psammead
so
anthea
hastily
uttered
the
word
of
power
without
which
the
charm
could
do
nothing
ur
hekau
setcheh
she
said
softly
and
as
she
spoke
the
charm
grew
into
an
arch
so
tall
that
the
top
of
it
was
close
against
the
bedroom
ceiling
outside
the
arch
was
the
bedroom
painted
and
the
kidderminster
carpet
and
the
with
the
riveted
jug
and
the
faded
curtains
and
the
dull
light
of
indoors
on
a
wet
day
through
the
arch
showed
the
gleam
of
soft
green
leaves
and
white
blossoms
they
stepped
forward
quite
happily
even
jane
felt
that
this
did
not
look
like
lions
and
her
hand
hardly
trembled
at
all
as
she
held
the
charm
for
the
others
to
go
through
and
last
slipped
through
herself
and
hung
the
charm
now
grown
small
again
round
her
neck
the
children
found
themselves
under
a
in
what
seemed
to
be
an
orchard
of
such
trees
all
and
among
the
long
green
grass
under
their
feet
grew
crocuses
and
lilies
and
strange
blue
flowers
in
the
branches
overhead
thrushes
and
blackbirds
were
singing
and
the
coo
of
a
pigeon
came
softly
to
them
in
the
green
quietness
of
the
orchard
oh
how
perfectly
lovely
cried
anthea
why
it
s
like
home
exactly
i
mean
england
only
everything
s
bluer
and
whiter
and
greener
and
the
flowers
are
the
boys
owned
that
it
certainly
was
fairly
decent
and
even
jane
admitted
that
it
was
all
very
pretty
i
m
certain
there
s
nothing
to
be
frightened
of
here
said
anthea
i
don
t
know
said
jane
i
suppose
the
go
on
just
the
same
even
when
people
are
killing
each
other
i
didn
t
half
like
what
the
learned
gentleman
said
about
the
hanging
gardens
i
suppose
they
have
gardens
on
purpose
to
hang
people
in
i
do
hope
this
isn
t
of
course
it
isn
t
said
cyril
the
hanging
gardens
are
just
gardens
hung
up
think
on
chains
between
houses
don
t
you
know
like
trays
come
on
let
s
get
they
began
to
walk
through
the
cool
grass
as
far
as
they
could
see
was
nothing
but
trees
and
trees
and
more
trees
at
the
end
of
their
orchard
was
another
one
only
separated
from
theirs
by
a
little
stream
of
clear
water
they
jumped
this
and
went
on
cyril
who
was
fond
of
gardening
which
meant
that
he
liked
to
watch
the
gardener
at
work
was
able
to
command
the
respect
of
the
others
by
telling
them
the
names
of
a
good
many
trees
there
were
and
and
apricots
and
with
their
big
leaves
and
every
now
and
then
the
children
had
to
cross
another
brook
it
s
like
between
the
squares
in
through
the
said
anthea
at
last
they
came
to
an
orchard
which
was
quite
different
from
the
other
orchards
it
had
a
low
building
in
one
corner
these
are
vines
said
cyril
superiorly
and
i
know
this
is
a
vineyard
i
shouldn
t
wonder
if
there
was
a
inside
that
place
over
at
last
they
got
out
of
the
orchards
and
on
to
a
sort
of
road
very
rough
and
not
at
all
like
the
roads
you
are
used
to
it
had
cypress
trees
and
acacia
trees
along
it
and
a
sort
of
hedge
of
tamarisks
like
those
you
see
on
the
road
between
nice
and
cannes
or
near
littlehampton
if
you
ve
only
been
as
far
as
that
and
now
in
front
of
them
they
could
see
a
great
mass
of
buildings
there
were
scattered
houses
of
wood
and
stone
here
and
there
among
green
orchards
and
beyond
these
a
great
wall
that
shone
red
in
the
early
morning
sun
the
wall
was
enormously
high
more
than
half
the
height
of
st
paul
s
and
in
the
wall
were
set
enormous
gates
that
shone
like
gold
as
the
rising
sun
beat
on
them
each
gate
had
a
solid
square
tower
on
each
side
of
it
that
stood
out
from
the
wall
and
rose
above
it
beyond
the
wall
were
more
towers
and
houses
gleaming
with
gold
and
bright
colours
away
to
the
left
ran
the
swirl
of
a
great
river
and
the
children
could
see
through
a
gap
in
the
trees
that
the
river
flowed
out
from
the
town
under
a
great
arch
in
the
wall
those
feathery
things
along
by
the
water
are
palms
said
cyril
instructively
oh
yes
you
know
everything
robert
replied
what
s
all
that
stuff
you
see
away
over
there
where
it
s
all
flat
and
sandy
all
right
said
cyril
loftily
don
t
want
to
tell
you
anything
i
only
thought
you
d
like
to
know
a
when
you
saw
it
look
cried
anthea
they
re
opening
the
and
indeed
the
great
gates
swung
back
with
a
brazen
clang
and
instantly
a
little
crowd
of
a
dozen
or
more
people
came
out
and
along
the
road
towards
them
the
children
with
one
accord
crouched
behind
the
tamarisk
hedge
i
don
t
like
the
sound
of
those
gates
said
jane
fancy
being
inside
when
they
shut
you
d
never
get
you
ve
got
an
arch
of
your
own
to
go
out
by
the
psammead
put
its
head
out
of
the
basket
to
remind
her
don
t
behave
so
like
a
girl
if
i
were
you
i
should
just
march
right
into
the
town
and
ask
to
see
the
there
was
something
at
once
simple
and
grand
about
this
idea
and
it
pleased
everyone
so
when
the
had
passed
they
were
the
children
felt
sure
because
they
were
dressed
so
plainly
just
one
long
blue
shirt
thing
of
blue
or
yellow
the
four
children
marched
boldly
up
to
the
brazen
gate
between
the
towers
the
arch
above
the
gate
was
quite
a
tunnel
the
walls
were
so
thick
courage
said
cyril
step
out
it
s
no
use
trying
to
sneak
past
be
bold
robert
answered
this
appeal
by
unexpectedly
bursting
into
the
british
grenadiers
and
to
its
they
approached
the
gates
of
babylon
some
talk
of
alexander
and
some
of
hercules
of
hector
and
lysander
and
such
great
names
as
these
but
of
all
the
gallant
heroes
this
brought
them
to
the
threshold
of
the
gate
and
two
men
in
bright
armour
suddenly
barred
their
way
with
crossed
spears
who
goes
there
they
said
i
think
i
must
have
explained
to
you
before
how
it
was
that
the
children
were
always
able
to
understand
the
language
of
any
place
they
might
happen
to
be
in
and
to
be
themselves
understood
if
not
i
have
no
time
to
explain
it
now
we
come
from
very
far
said
cyril
mechanically
from
the
empire
where
the
sun
never
sets
and
we
want
to
see
your
if
it
s
quite
convenient
amended
anthea
the
king
may
he
live
for
ever
said
the
gatekeeper
is
gone
to
fetch
home
his
fourteenth
wife
where
on
earth
have
you
come
from
not
to
know
that
the
queen
then
said
anthea
hurriedly
and
not
taking
any
notice
of
the
question
as
to
where
they
had
come
from
the
queen
said
the
gatekeeper
may
she
live
for
ever
gives
audience
today
three
hours
after
but
what
are
we
to
do
till
the
end
of
the
three
hours
asked
cyril
the
gatekeeper
seemed
neither
to
know
nor
to
care
he
appeared
less
interested
in
them
than
they
could
have
thought
possible
but
the
man
who
had
crossed
spears
with
him
to
bar
the
children
s
way
was
more
human
let
them
go
in
and
look
about
them
he
said
i
ll
wager
my
best
sword
they
ve
never
seen
anything
to
come
near
our
little
he
said
it
in
the
tone
people
use
for
when
they
call
the
atlantic
ocean
the
herring
pond
the
gatekeeper
hesitated
they
re
only
children
after
all
said
the
other
who
had
children
of
his
own
let
me
off
for
a
few
minutes
captain
and
i
ll
take
them
to
my
place
and
see
if
my
good
woman
can
t
fit
them
up
in
something
a
little
less
outlandish
than
their
present
rig
then
they
can
have
a
look
round
without
being
mobbed
may
i
go
oh
yes
if
you
like
said
the
captain
but
don
t
be
all
the
man
led
them
through
the
dark
arch
into
the
town
and
it
was
very
different
from
london
for
one
thing
everything
in
london
seems
to
be
patched
up
out
of
odds
and
ends
but
these
houses
seemed
to
have
been
built
by
people
who
liked
the
same
sort
of
things
not
that
they
were
all
alike
for
though
all
were
squarish
they
were
of
different
sizes
and
decorated
in
all
sorts
of
different
ways
some
with
paintings
in
bright
colours
some
with
black
and
silver
designs
there
were
terraces
and
gardens
and
balconies
and
open
spaces
with
trees
their
guide
took
them
to
a
little
house
in
a
back
street
where
a
woman
sat
spinning
at
the
door
of
a
very
dark
room
here
he
said
just
lend
these
children
a
mantle
each
so
that
they
can
go
about
and
see
the
place
till
the
queen
s
audience
begins
you
leave
that
wool
for
a
bit
and
show
them
round
if
you
like
i
must
be
off
the
woman
did
as
she
was
told
and
the
four
children
wrapped
in
fringed
mantles
went
with
her
all
about
the
town
and
oh
how
i
wish
i
had
time
to
tell
you
all
that
they
saw
it
was
all
so
wonderfully
different
from
anything
you
have
ever
seen
for
one
thing
all
the
houses
were
dazzlingly
bright
and
many
of
them
covered
with
pictures
some
had
great
creatures
carved
in
stone
at
each
side
of
the
door
then
the
people
there
were
no
black
and
tall
hats
no
dingy
coats
and
skirts
of
good
useful
ugly
stuffs
warranted
to
wear
everyone
s
clothes
were
bright
and
beautiful
with
blue
and
scarlet
and
green
and
gold
the
market
was
brighter
than
you
would
think
anything
could
be
there
were
stalls
for
everything
you
could
possibly
want
and
for
a
great
many
things
that
if
you
wanted
here
and
now
want
would
be
your
master
there
were
pineapples
and
peaches
in
heaps
and
stalls
of
crockery
and
glass
things
beautiful
shapes
and
glorious
colours
there
were
stalls
for
necklaces
and
clasps
and
bracelets
and
brooches
for
woven
stuffs
and
furs
and
embroidered
linen
the
children
had
never
seen
half
so
many
beautiful
things
together
even
at
liberty
s
it
seemed
no
time
at
all
before
the
woman
said
it
s
nearly
time
now
we
ought
to
be
getting
on
towards
the
palace
it
s
as
well
to
be
so
they
went
to
the
palace
and
when
they
got
there
it
was
more
splendid
than
anything
they
had
seen
yet
for
it
was
glowing
with
colours
and
with
gold
and
silver
and
black
and
white
like
some
magnificent
embroidery
flight
after
flight
of
broad
marble
steps
led
up
to
it
and
at
the
edges
of
the
stairs
stood
great
images
twenty
times
as
big
as
a
man
images
of
men
with
wings
like
chain
armour
and
hawks
heads
and
winged
men
with
the
heads
of
dogs
and
there
were
the
statues
of
great
kings
between
the
flights
of
steps
were
terraces
where
fountains
played
and
the
queen
s
guard
in
white
and
scarlet
and
armour
that
shone
like
gold
stood
by
twos
lining
the
way
up
the
stairs
and
a
great
body
of
them
was
massed
by
the
vast
door
of
the
palace
itself
where
it
stood
glittering
like
an
impossibly
radiant
peacock
in
the
sun
all
sorts
of
people
were
passing
up
the
steps
to
seek
audience
of
the
queen
ladies
in
dresses
with
fringy
flounces
poor
folks
in
plain
and
simple
clothes
dandies
with
beards
oiled
and
curled
and
cyril
robert
anthea
and
jane
went
with
the
crowd
at
the
gate
of
the
palace
the
psammead
put
one
eye
cautiously
out
of
the
basket
and
whispered
i
can
t
be
bothered
with
queens
i
ll
go
home
with
this
lady
i
m
sure
she
ll
get
me
some
sand
if
you
ask
her
oh
don
t
leave
us
said
jane
the
woman
was
giving
some
last
instructions
in
court
etiquette
to
anthea
and
did
not
hear
jane
don
t
be
a
little
muff
said
the
psammead
quite
fiercely
it
s
not
a
bit
of
good
your
having
a
charm
you
never
use
it
if
you
want
me
you
ve
only
got
to
say
the
name
of
power
and
ask
the
charm
to
bring
me
to
i
d
rather
go
with
you
said
jane
and
it
was
the
most
surprising
thing
she
had
ever
said
in
her
life
everyone
opened
its
mouth
without
thinking
of
manners
and
anthea
who
was
peeping
into
the
psammead
s
basket
saw
that
its
mouth
opened
wider
than
anybody
s
you
needn
t
gawp
like
that
jane
went
on
i
m
not
going
to
be
bothered
with
queens
any
more
than
it
is
and
i
know
wherever
it
is
it
ll
take
jolly
good
care
that
it
s
she
s
right
there
said
everyone
for
they
had
observed
that
the
psammead
had
a
way
of
knowing
which
side
its
bread
was
buttered
she
turned
to
the
woman
and
said
you
ll
take
me
home
with
you
won
t
you
and
let
me
play
with
your
little
girls
till
the
others
have
done
with
the
surely
i
will
little
heart
said
the
woman
and
then
anthea
hurriedly
stroked
the
psammead
and
embraced
jane
who
took
the
woman
s
hand
and
trotted
contentedly
away
with
the
psammead
s
bag
under
the
other
arm
the
others
stood
looking
after
her
till
she
the
woman
and
the
basket
were
lost
in
the
crowd
then
anthea
turned
once
more
to
the
palace
s
magnificent
doorway
and
said
let
s
ask
the
porter
to
take
care
of
our
babylonian
so
they
took
off
the
garments
that
the
woman
had
lent
them
and
stood
amid
the
jostling
petitioners
of
the
queen
in
their
own
english
frocks
and
coats
and
hats
and
boots
we
want
to
see
the
queen
said
cyril
we
come
from
the
far
empire
where
the
sun
never
sets
a
murmur
of
surprise
and
a
thrill
of
excitement
ran
through
the
crowd
the
spoke
to
a
black
man
he
spoke
to
someone
else
there
was
a
whispering
waiting
pause
then
a
big
man
with
a
face
beckoned
them
from
the
top
of
a
flight
of
red
marble
steps
they
went
up
the
boots
of
robert
clattering
more
than
usual
because
he
was
so
nervous
a
door
swung
open
a
curtain
was
drawn
back
a
double
line
of
bowing
forms
in
gorgeous
raiment
formed
a
lane
that
led
to
the
steps
of
the
throne
and
as
the
children
advanced
hurriedly
there
came
from
the
throne
a
voice
very
sweet
and
kind
three
children
from
the
land
where
the
sun
never
sets
let
them
draw
hither
without
in
another
minute
they
were
kneeling
at
the
throne
s
foot
saying
o
queen
live
for
ever
exactly
as
the
woman
had
taught
them
and
a
splendid
all
gold
and
silver
and
jewels
and
snowy
drift
of
veils
was
raising
anthea
and
saying
don
t
be
frightened
i
really
am
so
glad
you
came
the
land
where
the
sun
never
sets
i
am
delighted
to
see
you
i
was
getting
quite
too
dreadfully
bored
for
anything
and
behind
anthea
the
kneeling
cyril
whispered
in
the
ears
of
the
respectful
robert
bobs
don
t
say
anything
to
panther
it
s
no
use
upsetting
her
but
we
didn
t
ask
for
jane
s
address
and
the
psammead
s
with
well
whispered
robert
the
charm
can
bring
them
to
us
at
any
moment
it
said
oh
yes
whispered
cyril
in
miserable
derision
we
re
all
right
of
course
so
we
are
oh
yes
if
we
d
only
got
the
then
robert
saw
and
he
murmured
crikey
at
the
foot
of
the
throne
of
babylon
while
cyril
hoarsely
whispered
the
plain
english
fact
jane
s
got
the
charm
round
her
neck
you
silly
crikey
robert
repeated
in
undertones
chapter
the
deepest
dungeon
below
the
castle
moat
the
queen
threw
three
of
the
red
and
gold
embroidered
cushions
off
the
throne
on
to
the
marble
steps
that
led
up
to
it
just
make
yourselves
comfortable
there
she
said
i
m
simply
dying
to
talk
to
you
and
to
hear
all
about
your
wonderful
country
and
how
you
got
here
and
everything
but
i
have
to
do
justice
every
morning
such
a
bore
isn
t
it
do
you
do
justice
in
your
own
country
no
said
cyril
at
least
of
course
we
try
to
but
not
in
this
public
sort
of
way
only
in
ah
yes
said
the
queen
i
should
much
prefer
a
private
audience
myself
much
easier
to
manage
but
public
opinion
has
to
be
considered
doing
justice
is
very
hard
work
even
when
you
re
brought
up
to
we
don
t
do
justice
but
we
have
to
do
scales
jane
and
me
said
anthea
twenty
minutes
a
day
it
s
simply
what
are
scales
asked
the
queen
and
what
is
jane
jane
is
my
little
sister
one
of
the
s
wife
is
taking
care
of
her
and
scales
are
i
never
heard
of
the
instrument
said
the
queen
do
you
sing
oh
yes
we
can
sing
in
parts
said
anthea
that
is
magic
said
the
queen
how
many
parts
are
you
each
cut
into
before
you
do
it
we
aren
t
cut
at
all
said
robert
hastily
we
couldn
t
sing
if
we
were
we
ll
show
you
so
you
shall
and
now
sit
quiet
like
dear
children
and
hear
me
do
justice
the
way
i
do
it
has
always
been
admired
i
oughtn
t
to
say
that
ought
i
sounds
so
conceited
but
i
don
t
mind
with
you
dears
somehow
i
feel
as
though
i
d
known
you
quite
a
long
time
the
queen
settled
herself
on
her
throne
and
made
a
signal
to
her
attendants
the
children
whispering
together
among
the
cushions
on
the
steps
of
the
throne
decided
that
she
was
very
beautiful
and
very
kind
but
perhaps
just
the
least
bit
flighty
the
first
person
who
came
to
ask
for
justice
was
a
woman
whose
brother
had
taken
the
money
the
father
had
left
for
her
the
brother
said
it
was
the
uncle
who
had
the
money
there
was
a
good
deal
of
talk
and
the
children
were
growing
rather
bored
when
the
queen
suddenly
clapped
her
hands
and
said
put
both
the
men
in
prison
till
one
of
them
owns
up
that
the
other
is
but
suppose
they
both
did
it
cyril
could
not
help
interrupting
then
prison
s
the
best
place
for
them
said
the
queen
but
suppose
neither
did
that
s
impossible
said
the
queen
a
thing
s
not
done
unless
someone
does
it
and
you
mustn
t
then
came
a
woman
in
tears
with
a
torn
veil
and
real
ashes
on
her
head
at
least
anthea
thought
so
but
it
may
have
been
only
she
complained
that
her
husband
was
in
prison
what
for
said
the
queen
they
said
it
was
for
speaking
evil
of
your
majesty
said
the
woman
but
it
wasn
t
someone
had
a
spite
against
him
that
was
what
it
how
do
you
know
he
hadn
t
spoken
evil
of
me
said
the
queen
no
one
could
said
the
woman
simply
when
they
d
once
seen
your
beautiful
let
the
man
out
said
the
queen
smiling
next
the
next
case
was
that
of
a
boy
who
had
stolen
a
fox
like
the
spartan
boy
whispered
robert
but
the
queen
ruled
that
nobody
could
have
any
possible
reason
for
owning
a
fox
and
still
less
for
stealing
one
and
she
did
not
believe
that
there
were
any
foxes
in
babylon
she
at
any
rate
had
never
seen
one
so
the
boy
was
released
the
people
came
to
the
queen
about
all
sorts
of
family
quarrels
and
neighbourly
misunderstandings
from
a
fight
between
brothers
over
the
division
of
an
inheritance
to
the
dishonest
and
unfriendly
conduct
of
a
woman
who
had
borrowed
a
at
the
last
new
year
s
festival
and
not
returned
it
yet
and
the
queen
decided
everything
very
very
decidedly
indeed
at
last
she
clapped
her
hands
quite
suddenly
and
with
extreme
loudness
and
said
the
audience
is
over
for
everyone
said
may
the
queen
live
for
ever
and
went
out
and
the
children
were
left
alone
in
the
with
the
queen
of
babylon
and
her
ladies
there
said
the
queen
with
a
long
sigh
of
relief
that
s
over
i
couldn
t
have
done
another
stitch
of
justice
if
you
d
offered
me
the
crown
of
egypt
now
come
into
the
garden
and
we
ll
have
a
nice
long
cosy
she
led
them
through
long
narrow
corridors
whose
walls
they
somehow
felt
were
very
very
thick
into
a
sort
of
garden
courtyard
there
were
thick
shrubs
closely
planted
and
roses
were
trained
over
trellises
and
made
a
pleasant
shade
needed
indeed
for
already
the
sun
was
as
hot
as
it
is
in
england
in
august
at
the
seaside
slaves
spread
cushions
on
a
low
marble
terrace
and
a
big
man
with
a
smooth
face
served
cool
drink
in
cups
of
gold
studded
with
beryls
he
drank
a
little
from
the
queen
s
cup
before
handing
it
to
her
that
s
rather
a
nasty
trick
whispered
robert
who
had
been
carefully
taught
never
to
drink
out
of
one
of
the
nice
shiny
metal
cups
that
are
chained
to
the
london
drinking
fountains
without
first
rinsing
it
out
thoroughly
the
queen
overheard
him
not
at
all
said
she
is
a
very
clean
man
and
one
has
to
have
some
one
as
taster
you
know
because
of
the
word
made
the
children
feel
rather
creepy
but
had
tasted
all
the
cups
so
they
felt
pretty
safe
the
drink
was
delicious
very
cold
and
tasting
like
lemonade
and
partly
like
penny
ices
leave
us
said
the
queen
and
all
the
court
ladies
in
their
beautiful
fringed
dresses
filed
out
slowly
and
the
children
were
left
alone
with
the
queen
now
she
said
tell
me
all
about
they
looked
at
each
other
you
bobs
said
cyril
no
anthea
said
robert
no
you
cyril
said
anthea
don
t
you
remember
how
pleased
the
queen
of
india
was
when
you
told
her
all
about
us
cyril
muttered
that
it
was
all
very
well
and
so
it
was
for
when
he
had
told
the
tale
of
the
phoenix
and
the
carpet
to
the
ranee
it
had
been
only
the
truth
and
all
the
truth
that
he
had
to
tell
but
now
it
was
not
easy
to
tell
a
convincing
story
without
mentioning
the
amulet
which
of
course
it
wouldn
t
have
done
to
mention
and
without
owning
that
they
were
really
living
in
london
about
years
later
than
the
time
they
were
talking
in
cyril
took
refuge
in
the
tale
of
the
psammead
and
its
wonderful
power
of
making
wishes
come
true
the
children
had
never
been
able
to
tell
anyone
before
and
cyril
was
surprised
to
find
that
the
spell
which
kept
them
silent
in
london
did
not
work
here
something
to
do
with
our
being
in
the
past
i
suppose
he
said
to
himself
this
is
most
interesting
said
the
queen
we
must
have
this
psammead
for
the
banquet
tonight
its
performance
will
be
one
of
the
most
popular
turns
in
the
whole
programme
where
is
it
anthea
explained
that
they
did
not
know
also
why
it
was
that
they
did
not
know
oh
that
s
quite
simple
said
the
queen
and
everyone
breathed
a
deep
sigh
of
relief
as
she
said
it
shall
run
down
to
the
gates
and
find
out
which
guard
your
sister
went
home
might
he
anthea
s
voice
was
tremulous
might
he
would
it
interfere
with
his
or
anything
like
that
if
he
went
now
of
course
he
shall
go
now
he
may
think
himself
lucky
if
he
gets
his
meals
at
any
time
said
the
queen
heartily
and
clapped
her
hands
may
i
send
a
letter
asked
cyril
pulling
out
a
penny
and
feeling
in
his
pockets
for
a
stump
of
pencil
that
he
knew
was
in
one
of
them
by
all
means
i
ll
call
my
oh
i
can
scribe
right
enough
thanks
said
cyril
finding
the
pencil
and
licking
its
point
he
even
had
to
bite
the
wood
a
little
for
it
was
very
blunt
oh
you
clever
clever
boy
said
the
queen
do
let
me
watch
you
do
it
cyril
wrote
on
a
leaf
of
the
book
it
was
of
rough
woolly
paper
with
hairs
that
stuck
out
and
would
have
got
in
his
pen
if
he
had
been
using
one
and
ruled
for
accounts
hide
it
most
carefully
before
you
come
here
he
wrote
and
don
t
mention
it
and
destroy
this
letter
everything
is
going
the
queen
is
a
fair
treat
there
s
nothing
to
be
afraid
what
curious
characters
and
what
a
strange
flat
surface
said
the
queen
what
have
you
inscribed
i
ve
scribed
replied
cyril
cautiously
that
you
are
fair
and
a
and
like
a
like
a
festival
and
that
she
need
not
be
afraid
and
that
she
is
to
come
at
who
had
come
in
and
had
stood
waiting
while
cyril
wrote
his
babylonish
eyes
nearly
starting
out
of
his
babylonish
head
now
took
the
letter
with
some
reluctance
o
queen
live
for
ever
is
it
a
charm
he
timidly
asked
a
strong
charm
most
great
lady
yes
said
robert
unexpectedly
it
is
a
charm
but
it
won
t
hurt
anyone
until
you
ve
given
it
to
jane
and
then
she
ll
destroy
it
so
that
it
can
t
hurt
anyone
it
s
most
awful
strong
as
strong
as
peppermint
he
ended
abruptly
i
know
not
the
god
said
bending
timorously
she
ll
tear
it
up
directly
she
gets
it
said
robert
that
ll
end
the
charm
you
needn
t
be
afraid
if
you
go
went
seeming
only
partly
satisfied
and
then
the
queen
began
to
admire
the
penny
and
the
bit
of
pencil
in
so
marked
and
significant
a
way
that
cyril
felt
he
could
not
do
less
than
press
them
upon
her
as
a
gift
she
ruffled
the
leaves
delightedly
what
a
wonderful
substance
she
said
and
with
this
style
you
make
charms
make
a
charm
for
me
do
you
know
her
voice
sank
to
a
whisper
the
names
of
the
great
ones
of
your
own
far
country
rather
said
cyril
and
hastily
wrote
the
names
of
alfred
the
great
shakespeare
nelson
gordon
lord
beaconsfield
mr
rudyard
kipling
and
mr
sherlock
holmes
while
the
queen
watched
him
with
unbaited
breath
as
anthea
said
afterwards
she
took
the
book
and
hid
it
reverently
among
the
bright
folds
of
her
gown
you
shall
teach
me
later
to
say
the
great
names
she
said
and
the
names
of
their
ministers
perhaps
the
great
nisroch
is
one
of
them
i
don
t
think
so
said
cyril
mr
campbell
bannerman
s
prime
minister
and
mr
burns
a
minister
and
so
is
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
i
think
but
i
m
not
sure
and
dr
parker
was
one
i
know
and
no
more
said
the
queen
putting
her
hands
to
her
ears
my
head
s
going
round
with
all
those
great
names
you
shall
teach
them
to
me
later
because
of
course
you
ll
make
us
a
nice
long
visit
now
you
have
come
won
t
you
now
tell
me
but
no
i
am
quite
tired
out
with
your
being
so
clever
besides
i
m
sure
you
d
like
me
to
tell
you
something
wouldn
t
you
yes
said
anthea
i
want
to
know
how
it
is
that
the
king
has
gone
excuse
me
but
you
should
say
the
king
said
the
queen
gently
i
beg
your
pardon
anthea
hastened
to
say
the
king
has
gone
to
fetch
home
his
fourteenth
wife
i
don
t
think
even
bluebeard
had
as
many
as
that
and
besides
he
hasn
t
killed
you
at
any
the
queen
looked
bewildered
she
means
explained
robert
that
english
kings
only
have
one
wife
at
least
henry
the
eighth
had
seven
or
eight
but
not
all
at
in
our
country
said
the
queen
scornfully
a
king
would
not
reign
a
day
who
had
only
one
wife
no
one
would
respect
him
and
quite
right
then
are
all
the
other
thirteen
alive
asked
anthea
of
course
they
are
poor
things
i
don
t
associate
with
them
of
course
i
am
the
queen
they
re
only
the
i
see
said
anthea
gasping
but
oh
my
dears
the
queen
went
on
such
a
as
there
s
been
about
this
last
wife
you
never
did
it
really
was
too
funny
we
wanted
an
egyptian
princess
the
king
has
got
a
wife
from
most
of
the
important
nations
and
he
had
set
his
heart
on
an
egyptian
one
to
complete
his
collection
well
of
course
to
begin
with
we
sent
a
handsome
present
of
gold
the
egyptian
king
sent
back
some
horses
quite
a
few
he
s
fearfully
stingy
and
he
said
he
liked
the
gold
very
much
but
what
they
were
really
short
of
was
lapis
lazuli
so
of
course
we
sent
him
some
but
by
that
time
he
d
begun
to
use
the
gold
to
cover
the
beams
of
the
roof
of
the
temple
of
the
and
he
hadn
t
nearly
enough
to
finish
the
job
so
we
sent
some
more
and
so
it
went
on
oh
for
years
you
see
each
journey
takes
at
least
six
months
and
at
last
we
asked
the
hand
of
his
daughter
in
yes
and
then
said
anthea
who
wanted
to
get
to
the
princess
part
of
the
story
well
then
said
the
queen
when
he
d
got
everything
out
of
us
that
he
could
and
only
given
the
meanest
presents
in
return
he
sent
to
say
he
would
esteem
the
honour
of
an
alliance
very
highly
only
unfortunately
he
hadn
t
any
daughter
but
he
hoped
one
would
be
born
soon
and
if
so
she
should
certainly
be
reserved
for
the
king
of
babylon
what
a
trick
said
cyril
yes
wasn
t
it
so
then
we
said
his
sister
would
do
and
then
there
were
more
gifts
and
more
journeys
and
now
at
last
the
tiresome
thing
is
coming
and
the
king
has
gone
seven
days
journey
to
meet
her
at
carchemish
and
he
s
gone
in
his
best
chariot
the
one
inlaid
with
lapis
lazuli
and
gold
with
the
wheels
and
hubs
much
too
great
an
honour
in
my
opinion
she
ll
be
here
tonight
there
ll
be
a
grand
banquet
to
celebrate
her
arrival
she
won
t
be
present
of
course
she
ll
be
having
her
baths
and
her
anointings
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
we
always
clean
our
foreign
brides
very
carefully
it
takes
two
or
three
weeks
now
it
s
dinnertime
and
you
shall
eat
with
me
for
i
can
see
that
you
are
of
high
she
led
them
into
a
dark
cool
hall
with
many
cushions
on
the
floor
on
these
they
sat
and
low
tables
were
brought
beautiful
tables
of
smooth
blue
stone
mounted
in
gold
on
these
golden
trays
were
placed
but
there
were
no
knives
or
forks
or
spoons
the
children
expected
the
queen
to
call
for
them
but
no
she
just
ate
with
her
fingers
and
as
the
first
dish
was
a
great
tray
of
boiled
corn
and
meat
and
raisins
all
mixed
up
together
and
melted
fat
poured
all
over
the
tray
it
was
found
difficult
to
follow
her
example
with
anything
like
what
we
are
used
to
think
of
as
good
table
manners
there
were
stewed
quinces
afterwards
and
dates
in
syrup
and
thick
yellowy
cream
it
was
the
kind
of
dinner
you
hardly
ever
get
in
fitzroy
street
after
dinner
everybody
went
to
sleep
even
the
children
the
queen
awoke
with
a
start
good
gracious
she
cried
what
a
time
we
ve
slept
i
must
rush
off
and
dress
for
the
banquet
i
shan
t
have
much
more
than
hasn
t
got
back
with
our
sister
and
the
psammead
yet
anthea
asked
i
quite
forgot
to
ask
i
m
sorry
said
the
queen
and
of
course
they
wouldn
t
announce
her
unless
i
told
them
to
except
during
justice
hours
i
expect
she
s
waiting
outside
i
ll
came
in
a
moment
later
i
regret
he
said
that
i
have
been
unable
to
find
your
sister
the
beast
she
bears
with
her
in
a
basket
has
bitten
the
child
of
the
guard
and
your
sister
and
the
beast
set
out
to
come
to
you
the
police
say
they
have
a
clue
no
doubt
we
shall
have
news
of
her
in
a
few
he
bowed
and
withdrew
the
horror
of
this
threefold
loss
jane
the
psammead
and
the
amulet
gave
the
children
something
to
talk
about
while
the
queen
was
dressing
i
shall
not
report
their
conversation
it
was
very
gloomy
everyone
repeated
himself
several
times
and
the
discussion
ended
in
each
of
them
blaming
the
other
two
for
having
let
jane
go
you
know
the
sort
of
talk
it
was
don
t
you
at
last
cyril
said
after
all
she
s
with
the
psammead
so
she
s
all
right
the
psammead
is
jolly
careful
of
itself
too
and
it
isn
t
as
if
we
were
in
any
danger
let
s
try
to
buck
up
and
enjoy
the
they
did
enjoy
the
banquet
they
had
a
beautiful
bath
which
was
delicious
were
heavily
oiled
all
over
including
their
hair
and
that
was
most
unpleasant
then
they
dressed
again
and
were
presented
to
the
king
who
was
most
affable
the
banquet
was
long
there
were
all
sorts
of
nice
things
to
eat
and
everybody
seemed
to
eat
and
drink
a
good
deal
everyone
lay
on
cushions
and
couches
ladies
on
one
side
and
gentlemen
on
the
other
and
after
the
eating
was
done
each
lady
went
and
sat
by
some
gentleman
who
seemed
to
be
her
sweetheart
or
her
husband
for
they
were
very
affectionate
to
each
other
the
court
dresses
had
gold
threads
woven
in
them
very
bright
and
beautiful
the
middle
of
the
room
was
left
clear
and
different
people
came
and
did
amusing
things
there
were
conjurers
and
jugglers
and
which
last
anthea
did
not
like
at
all
when
it
got
dark
torches
were
lighted
cedar
splinters
dipped
in
oil
blazed
in
copper
dishes
set
high
on
poles
then
there
was
a
dancer
who
hardly
danced
at
all
only
just
struck
attitudes
she
had
hardly
any
clothes
and
was
not
at
all
pretty
the
children
were
rather
bored
by
her
but
everyone
else
was
delighted
including
the
king
by
the
beard
of
nimrod
he
cried
ask
what
you
like
girl
and
you
shall
have
it
i
want
nothing
said
the
dancer
the
honour
of
having
pleased
the
king
is
reward
enough
for
and
the
king
was
so
pleased
with
this
modest
and
sensible
reply
that
he
gave
her
the
gold
collar
off
his
own
neck
i
say
said
cyril
awed
by
the
magnificence
of
the
gift
it
s
all
right
whispered
the
queen
it
s
not
his
best
collar
by
any
means
we
always
keep
a
stock
of
cheap
jewellery
for
these
occasions
and
now
you
promised
to
sing
us
something
would
you
like
my
minstrels
to
accompany
you
no
thank
you
said
anthea
quickly
the
minstrels
had
been
playing
off
and
on
all
the
time
and
their
music
reminded
anthea
of
the
band
she
and
the
others
had
once
had
on
the
fifth
of
november
with
penny
horns
a
tin
whistle
a
the
tongs
a
policeman
s
rattle
and
a
toy
drum
they
had
enjoyed
this
band
very
much
at
the
time
but
it
was
quite
different
when
someone
else
was
making
the
same
kind
of
music
anthea
understood
now
that
father
had
not
been
really
heartless
and
unreasonable
when
he
had
told
them
to
stop
that
infuriating
din
what
shall
we
sing
cyril
was
asking
sweet
and
low
suggested
anthea
too
soft
i
vote
for
who
will
o
er
the
downs
now
then
one
two
three
oh
who
will
o
er
the
downs
so
free
oh
who
will
with
me
ride
oh
who
will
up
and
follow
me
to
win
a
blooming
bride
her
father
he
has
locked
the
door
her
mother
keeps
the
key
but
neither
bolt
nor
bar
shall
keep
my
own
true
love
from
jane
the
alto
was
missing
and
robert
unlike
the
mother
of
the
lady
in
the
song
never
could
keep
the
key
but
the
song
even
so
was
sufficiently
unlike
anything
any
of
them
had
ever
heard
to
rouse
the
babylonian
court
to
the
wildest
enthusiasm
more
more
cried
the
king
by
my
beard
this
savage
music
is
a
new
thing
sing
again
so
they
sang
i
saw
her
bower
at
twilight
gray
twas
guarded
safe
and
sure
i
saw
her
bower
at
break
of
day
twas
guarded
then
no
more
the
varlets
they
were
all
asleep
and
there
was
none
to
see
the
greeting
fair
that
passed
there
between
my
love
and
shouts
of
applause
greeted
the
ending
of
the
verse
and
the
king
would
not
be
satisfied
till
they
had
sung
all
their
they
only
knew
three
twice
over
and
ended
up
with
men
of
harlech
in
unison
then
the
king
stood
up
in
his
royal
robes
with
his
high
narrow
crown
on
his
head
and
shouted
by
the
beak
of
nisroch
ask
what
you
will
strangers
from
the
land
where
the
sun
never
sets
we
ought
to
say
it
s
enough
honour
like
the
dancer
did
whispered
anthea
no
let
s
ask
for
it
said
robert
no
no
i
m
sure
the
other
s
manners
said
anthea
but
robert
who
was
excited
by
the
music
and
the
flaring
torches
and
the
applause
and
the
opportunity
spoke
up
before
the
others
could
stop
him
give
us
the
half
of
the
amulet
that
has
on
it
the
name
ur
hekau
setcheh
he
said
adding
as
an
afterthought
o
king
as
he
spoke
the
great
name
those
in
the
pillared
hall
fell
on
their
faces
and
lay
still
all
but
the
queen
who
crouched
amid
her
cushions
with
her
head
in
her
hands
and
the
king
who
stood
upright
perfectly
still
like
the
statue
of
a
king
in
stone
it
was
only
for
a
moment
though
then
his
great
voice
thundered
out
guard
seize
them
instantly
from
nowhere
as
it
seemed
sprang
eight
soldiers
in
bright
armour
inlaid
with
gold
and
tunics
of
red
and
white
very
splendid
they
were
and
very
alarming
impious
and
sacrilegious
wretches
shouted
the
king
to
the
dungeons
with
them
we
will
find
a
way
tomorrow
to
make
them
speak
for
without
doubt
they
can
tell
us
where
to
find
the
lost
half
of
a
wall
of
scarlet
and
white
and
steel
and
gold
closed
up
round
the
children
and
hurried
them
away
among
the
many
pillars
of
the
great
hall
as
they
went
they
heard
the
voices
of
the
courtiers
loud
in
horror
you
ve
done
it
this
time
said
cyril
with
extreme
bitterness
oh
it
will
come
right
it
must
it
always
does
said
anthea
desperately
they
could
not
see
where
they
were
going
because
the
guard
surrounded
them
so
closely
but
the
ground
under
their
feet
smooth
marble
at
first
grew
rougher
like
stone
then
it
was
loose
earth
and
sand
and
they
felt
the
night
air
then
there
was
more
stone
and
steps
down
it
s
my
belief
we
really
are
going
to
the
deepest
dungeon
below
the
castle
moat
this
time
said
cyril
and
they
were
at
least
it
was
not
below
a
moat
but
below
the
river
euphrates
which
was
just
as
bad
if
not
worse
in
a
most
unpleasant
place
it
was
dark
very
very
damp
and
with
an
odd
musty
smell
rather
like
the
shells
of
oysters
there
was
a
torch
that
is
to
say
a
copper
basket
on
a
high
stick
with
oiled
wood
burning
in
it
by
its
light
the
children
saw
that
the
walls
were
green
and
that
trickles
of
water
ran
down
them
and
dripped
from
the
roof
there
were
things
on
the
floor
that
looked
like
newts
and
in
the
dark
corners
creepy
shiny
things
moved
sluggishly
uneasily
horribly
robert
s
heart
sank
right
into
those
really
reliable
boots
of
his
anthea
and
cyril
each
had
a
private
struggle
with
that
inside
disagreeableness
which
is
part
of
all
of
us
and
which
is
sometimes
called
the
old
adam
and
both
were
victors
neither
of
them
said
to
robert
and
both
tried
hard
not
even
to
think
it
this
is
your
anthea
had
the
additional
temptation
to
add
i
told
you
and
she
resisted
it
successfully
sacrilege
and
impious
cheek
said
the
captain
of
the
guard
to
the
gaoler
to
be
kept
during
the
king
s
pleasure
i
expect
he
means
to
get
some
pleasure
out
of
them
tomorrow
he
ll
tickle
them
up
poor
little
kids
said
the
gaoler
oh
yes
said
the
captain
i
ve
got
kids
of
my
own
too
but
it
doesn
t
do
to
let
domestic
sentiment
interfere
with
one
s
public
duties
good
the
soldiers
tramped
heavily
off
in
their
white
and
red
and
steel
and
gold
the
gaoler
with
a
bunch
of
big
keys
in
his
hand
stood
looking
pityingly
at
the
children
he
shook
his
head
twice
and
went
out
courage
said
anthea
i
know
it
will
be
all
right
it
s
only
a
dream
really
you
know
it
must
be
i
don
t
believe
about
time
being
only
a
something
or
other
of
thought
it
is
a
dream
and
we
re
bound
to
wake
up
all
right
and
humph
said
cyril
bitterly
and
robert
suddenly
said
it
s
all
my
doing
if
it
really
is
all
up
do
please
not
keep
a
down
on
me
about
it
and
tell
father
oh
i
what
he
had
forgotten
was
that
his
father
was
miles
and
or
more
years
away
from
him
all
right
bobs
old
man
said
cyril
and
anthea
got
hold
of
robert
s
hand
and
squeezed
it
then
the
gaoler
came
back
with
a
platter
of
hard
flat
cakes
made
of
coarse
grain
very
different
from
the
feasts
of
the
palace
also
a
pitcher
of
water
there
he
said
oh
thank
you
so
very
much
you
are
kind
said
anthea
feverishly
go
to
sleep
said
the
gaoler
pointing
to
a
heap
of
straw
in
a
corner
tomorrow
comes
soon
oh
dear
mr
gaoler
said
anthea
whatever
will
they
do
to
us
tomorrow
they
ll
try
to
make
you
tell
things
said
the
gaoler
grimly
and
my
advice
is
if
you
ve
nothing
to
tell
make
up
something
then
perhaps
they
ll
sell
you
to
the
northern
nations
regular
savages
they
are
good
good
night
said
three
trembling
voices
which
their
owners
strove
in
vain
to
render
firm
then
he
went
out
and
the
three
were
left
alone
in
the
damp
dim
vault
i
know
the
light
won
t
last
long
said
cyril
looking
at
the
flickering
brazier
is
it
any
good
do
you
think
calling
on
the
name
when
we
haven
t
got
the
charm
suggested
anthea
i
shouldn
t
think
so
but
we
might
so
they
tried
but
the
blank
silence
of
the
damp
dungeon
remained
unchanged
what
was
the
name
the
queen
said
asked
cyril
suddenly
nisbeth
nesbit
something
you
know
the
slave
of
the
great
names
wait
a
sec
said
robert
though
i
don
t
know
why
you
want
it
nusroch
nisrock
nisroch
that
s
then
anthea
pulled
herself
together
all
her
muscles
tightened
and
the
muscles
of
her
mind
and
soul
if
you
can
call
them
that
tightened
too
ur
hekau
setcheh
she
cried
in
a
fervent
voice
oh
nisroch
servant
of
the
great
ones
come
and
help
us
there
was
a
waiting
silence
then
a
cold
blue
light
awoke
in
the
corner
where
the
straw
was
and
in
the
light
they
saw
coming
towards
them
a
strange
and
terrible
figure
i
won
t
try
to
describe
it
because
the
drawing
shows
it
exactly
as
it
was
and
exactly
as
the
old
babylonians
carved
it
on
their
stones
so
that
you
can
see
it
in
our
own
british
museum
at
this
day
i
will
just
say
that
it
had
eagle
s
wings
and
an
eagle
s
head
and
the
body
of
a
man
it
came
towards
them
strong
and
unspeakably
horrible
oh
go
away
cried
anthea
but
cyril
cried
no
stay
the
creature
hesitated
then
bowed
low
before
them
on
the
damp
floor
of
the
dungeon
speak
it
said
in
a
harsh
grating
voice
like
large
rusty
keys
being
turned
in
locks
the
servant
of
the
great
ones
is
your
servant
what
is
your
need
that
you
call
on
the
name
of
nisroch
we
want
to
go
home
said
robert
no
no
cried
anthea
we
want
to
be
where
jane
nisroch
raised
his
great
arm
and
pointed
at
the
wall
of
the
dungeon
and
as
he
pointed
the
wall
disappeared
and
instead
of
the
damp
green
rocky
surface
there
shone
and
glowed
a
room
with
rich
hangings
of
red
silk
embroidered
with
golden
with
cushioned
couches
and
great
mirrors
of
polished
steel
and
in
it
was
the
queen
and
before
her
on
a
red
pillow
sat
the
psammead
its
fur
hunched
up
in
an
irritated
discontented
way
on
a
couch
lay
jane
fast
asleep
walk
forward
without
fear
said
nisroch
is
there
aught
else
that
the
servant
of
the
great
name
can
do
for
those
who
speak
that
name
no
oh
no
said
cyril
it
s
all
right
now
thanks
ever
you
are
a
dear
cried
anthea
not
in
the
least
knowing
what
she
was
saying
oh
thank
you
thank
you
but
do
go
now
she
caught
the
hand
of
the
creature
and
it
was
cold
and
hard
in
hers
like
a
hand
of
stone
go
forward
said
nisroch
and
they
went
oh
my
good
gracious
said
the
queen
as
they
stood
before
her
how
did
you
get
here
i
knew
you
were
magic
i
meant
to
let
you
out
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
if
i
could
slip
away
but
thanks
be
to
dagon
you
ve
managed
it
for
yourselves
you
must
get
away
i
ll
wake
my
chief
lady
and
she
shall
call
and
he
ll
let
you
out
the
back
way
and
don
t
rouse
anybody
for
goodness
sake
said
anthea
except
jane
and
i
ll
rouse
she
shook
jane
with
energy
and
jane
slowly
awoke
brought
them
in
hours
ago
really
said
the
queen
but
i
wanted
to
have
the
psammead
all
to
myself
for
a
bit
you
ll
excuse
the
little
natural
deception
it
s
part
of
the
babylonish
character
don
t
you
know
but
i
don
t
want
anything
to
happen
to
you
do
let
me
rouse
no
no
no
said
anthea
with
desperate
earnestness
she
thought
she
knew
enough
of
what
the
babylonians
were
like
when
they
were
roused
we
can
go
by
our
own
magic
and
you
will
tell
the
king
it
wasn
t
the
gaoler
s
fault
it
was
nisroch
echoed
the
queen
you
are
indeed
jane
sat
up
blinking
stupidly
hold
it
up
and
say
the
word
cried
cyril
catching
up
the
psammead
which
mechanically
bit
him
but
only
very
slightly
which
is
the
east
asked
jane
behind
me
said
the
queen
why
ur
hekau
setcheh
said
jane
sleepily
and
held
up
the
charm
and
there
they
all
were
in
the
at
fitzroy
street
jane
cried
cyril
with
great
presence
of
mind
go
and
get
the
plate
of
sand
down
for
the
jane
went
look
here
he
said
quickly
as
the
sound
of
her
boots
grew
less
loud
on
the
stairs
don
t
let
s
tell
her
about
the
dungeon
and
all
that
it
ll
only
frighten
her
so
that
she
ll
never
want
to
go
anywhere
righto
said
cyril
but
anthea
felt
that
she
could
not
have
said
a
word
to
save
her
life
why
did
you
want
to
come
back
in
such
a
hurry
asked
jane
returning
with
the
plate
of
sand
it
was
awfully
jolly
in
babylon
i
think
i
liked
it
no
oh
yes
said
cyril
carelessly
it
was
jolly
enough
of
course
but
i
thought
we
d
been
there
long
enough
mother
always
says
you
oughtn
t
to
wear
out
your
welcome
chapter
the
queen
in
london
now
tell
us
what
happened
to
you
said
cyril
to
jane
when
he
and
the
others
had
told
her
all
about
the
queen
s
talk
and
the
banquet
and
the
variety
entertainment
carefully
stopping
short
before
the
beginning
of
the
dungeon
part
of
the
story
it
wasn
t
much
good
going
said
jane
if
you
didn
t
even
try
to
get
the
we
found
out
it
was
no
go
said
cyril
it
s
not
to
be
got
in
babylon
it
was
lost
before
that
we
ll
go
to
some
other
jolly
friendly
place
where
everyone
is
kind
and
pleasant
and
look
for
it
there
now
tell
us
about
your
oh
said
jane
the
queen
s
man
with
the
smooth
face
what
was
his
name
said
cyril
yes
said
jane
he
came
for
me
just
after
the
psammead
had
bitten
the
s
wife
s
little
boy
and
he
took
me
to
the
palace
and
we
had
supper
with
the
new
little
queen
from
egypt
she
is
a
dear
not
much
older
than
you
she
told
me
heaps
about
egypt
and
we
played
ball
after
supper
and
then
the
babylon
queen
sent
for
me
i
like
her
too
and
she
talked
to
the
psammead
and
i
went
to
sleep
and
then
you
woke
me
up
that
s
the
psammead
roused
from
its
sound
sleep
told
the
same
story
but
it
added
what
possessed
you
to
tell
that
queen
that
i
could
give
wishes
i
sometimes
think
you
were
born
without
even
the
most
rudimentary
imitation
of
the
children
did
not
know
the
meaning
of
rudimentary
but
it
sounded
a
rude
insulting
word
i
don
t
see
that
we
did
any
harm
said
cyril
sulkily
oh
no
said
the
psammead
with
withering
irony
not
at
all
of
course
not
quite
the
contrary
exactly
so
only
she
happened
to
wish
that
she
might
soon
find
herself
in
your
country
and
soon
may
mean
any
then
it
s
your
fault
said
robert
because
you
might
just
as
well
have
made
soon
mean
some
moment
next
year
or
next
that
s
where
you
as
so
often
happens
make
the
mistake
rejoined
the
couldn
t
mean
anything
but
what
she
meant
by
soon
it
wasn
t
my
wish
and
what
she
meant
was
the
next
time
the
king
happens
to
go
out
lion
hunting
so
she
ll
have
a
whole
day
and
perhaps
two
to
do
as
she
wishes
with
she
doesn
t
know
about
time
only
being
a
mode
of
well
said
cyril
with
a
sigh
of
resignation
we
must
do
what
we
can
to
give
her
a
good
time
she
was
jolly
decent
to
us
i
say
suppose
we
were
to
go
to
st
james
s
park
after
dinner
and
feed
those
ducks
that
we
never
did
feed
after
all
that
babylon
and
all
those
years
ago
i
feel
as
if
i
should
like
to
see
something
real
and
now
you
ll
come
psammead
where
s
my
priceless
woven
basket
of
sacred
rushes
asked
the
psammead
morosely
i
can
t
go
out
with
nothing
on
and
i
won
t
what
s
and
then
everybody
remembered
with
pain
that
the
bass
bag
had
in
the
hurry
of
departure
from
babylon
not
been
remembered
but
it
s
not
so
extra
precious
said
robert
hastily
you
can
get
them
given
to
you
for
nothing
if
you
buy
fish
in
farringdon
oh
said
the
psammead
very
crossly
indeed
so
you
presume
on
my
sublime
indifference
to
the
things
of
this
disgusting
modern
world
to
fob
me
off
with
a
travelling
equipage
that
costs
you
nothing
very
well
i
shall
go
to
sand
please
don
t
wake
and
it
went
then
and
there
to
sand
which
as
you
know
meant
to
bed
the
boys
went
to
st
james
s
park
to
feed
the
ducks
but
they
went
alone
anthea
and
jane
sat
sewing
all
the
afternoon
they
cut
off
half
a
yard
from
each
of
their
best
green
liberty
sashes
a
towel
cut
in
two
formed
a
lining
and
they
sat
and
sewed
and
sewed
and
sewed
what
they
were
making
was
a
bag
for
the
psammead
each
worked
at
a
half
of
the
bag
jane
s
half
had
shamrocks
embroidered
on
it
they
were
the
only
things
she
could
do
because
she
had
been
taught
how
at
school
and
fortunately
some
of
the
silk
she
had
been
taught
with
was
left
over
and
even
so
anthea
had
to
draw
the
pattern
for
her
anthea
s
side
of
the
bag
had
letters
on
it
worked
hastily
but
affectionately
in
chain
stitch
they
were
something
like
this
psams
travel
car
she
would
have
put
travelling
carriage
but
she
made
the
letters
too
big
so
there
was
no
room
the
bag
was
made
into
a
bag
with
old
nurse
s
sewing
machine
and
the
strings
of
it
were
anthea
s
and
jane
s
best
red
hair
ribbons
at
when
the
boys
had
come
home
with
a
most
unfavourable
report
of
the
st
james
s
park
ducks
anthea
ventured
to
awaken
the
psammead
and
to
show
it
its
new
travelling
bag
humph
it
said
sniffing
a
little
contemptuously
yet
at
the
same
time
affectionately
it
s
not
so
the
psammead
seemed
to
pick
up
very
easily
the
kind
of
things
that
people
said
nowadays
for
a
creature
that
had
in
its
time
associated
with
megatheriums
and
pterodactyls
its
quickness
was
really
wonderful
it
s
more
worthy
of
me
it
said
than
the
kind
of
bag
that
s
given
away
with
a
pound
of
plaice
when
do
you
propose
to
take
me
out
in
it
i
should
like
a
rest
from
taking
you
or
us
anywhere
said
cyril
but
jane
said
i
want
to
go
to
egypt
i
did
like
that
egyptian
princess
that
came
to
marry
the
king
in
babylon
she
told
me
about
the
larks
they
have
in
egypt
and
the
cats
do
let
s
go
there
and
i
told
her
what
the
bird
things
on
the
amulet
were
like
and
she
said
it
was
egyptian
the
others
exchanged
looks
of
silent
rejoicing
at
the
thought
of
their
cleverness
in
having
concealed
from
jane
the
terrors
they
had
suffered
in
the
dungeon
below
the
euphrates
egypt
s
so
nice
too
jane
went
on
because
of
doctor
brewer
s
scripture
history
i
would
like
to
go
there
when
joseph
was
dreaming
those
curious
dreams
or
when
moses
was
doing
wonderful
things
with
snakes
and
i
don
t
care
about
snakes
said
anthea
shuddering
well
we
needn
t
be
in
at
that
part
but
babylon
was
lovely
we
had
cream
and
sweet
sticky
stuff
and
i
expect
egypt
s
the
there
was
a
good
deal
of
discussion
but
it
all
ended
in
everybody
s
agreeing
to
jane
s
idea
and
next
morning
directly
after
breakfast
which
was
kippers
and
very
nice
the
psammead
was
invited
to
get
into
his
travelling
carriage
the
moment
after
it
had
done
so
with
stiff
furry
reluctance
like
that
of
a
cat
when
you
want
to
nurse
it
and
its
ideas
are
not
the
same
as
yours
old
nurse
came
in
well
chickies
she
said
are
you
feeling
very
dull
oh
no
nurse
dear
said
anthea
we
re
having
a
lovely
time
we
re
just
going
off
to
see
some
old
ancient
ah
said
old
nurse
the
royal
academy
i
suppose
don
t
go
wasting
your
money
too
reckless
that
s
she
cleared
away
the
kipper
bones
and
the
and
when
she
had
swept
up
the
crumbs
and
removed
the
cloth
the
amulet
was
held
up
and
the
order
given
just
as
duchesses
and
other
people
give
it
to
their
coachmen
to
egypt
please
said
anthea
when
cyril
had
uttered
the
wonderful
name
of
power
when
moses
was
there
added
jane
and
there
in
the
dingy
fitzroy
street
the
amulet
grew
big
and
it
was
an
arch
and
through
it
they
saw
a
blue
blue
sky
and
a
running
river
no
stop
said
cyril
and
pulled
down
jane
s
hand
with
the
amulet
in
it
what
silly
cuckoos
we
all
are
he
said
of
course
we
can
t
go
we
daren
t
leave
home
for
a
single
minute
now
for
fear
that
minute
should
be
the
what
minute
be
what
minute
asked
jane
impatiently
trying
to
get
her
hand
away
from
cyril
the
minute
when
the
queen
of
babylon
comes
said
cyril
and
then
everyone
saw
it
for
some
days
life
flowed
in
a
very
slow
dusty
uneventful
stream
the
children
could
never
go
out
all
at
once
because
they
never
knew
when
the
king
of
babylon
would
go
out
lion
hunting
and
leave
his
queen
free
to
pay
them
that
surprise
visit
to
which
she
was
without
doubt
eagerly
looking
forward
so
they
took
it
in
turns
two
and
two
to
go
out
and
to
stay
in
the
would
have
been
much
duller
than
they
were
but
for
the
new
interest
taken
in
them
by
the
learned
gentleman
he
called
anthea
in
one
day
to
show
her
a
beautiful
necklace
of
purple
and
gold
beads
i
saw
one
like
that
she
said
in
in
the
british
museum
perhaps
i
like
to
call
the
place
where
i
saw
it
babylon
said
anthea
cautiously
a
pretty
fancy
said
the
learned
gentleman
and
quite
correct
too
because
as
a
matter
of
fact
these
beads
did
come
from
the
other
three
were
all
out
that
day
the
boys
had
been
going
to
the
zoo
and
jane
had
said
so
plaintively
i
m
sure
i
am
fonder
of
rhinoceroses
than
either
of
you
are
that
anthea
had
told
her
to
run
along
then
and
she
had
run
catching
the
boys
before
that
part
of
the
road
where
fitzroy
street
suddenly
becomes
fitzroy
square
i
think
babylon
is
most
frightfully
interesting
said
anthea
i
do
have
such
interesting
dreams
about
it
at
least
not
dreams
exactly
but
quite
as
do
sit
down
and
tell
me
said
he
so
she
sat
down
and
told
and
he
asked
her
a
lot
of
questions
and
she
answered
them
as
well
as
she
could
wonderful
wonderful
he
said
at
last
one
s
heard
of
but
i
never
thought
had
any
power
of
that
sort
yet
it
must
be
that
and
very
bad
for
you
i
should
think
doesn
t
your
head
ache
very
much
he
suddenly
put
a
cold
thin
hand
on
her
forehead
no
thank
you
not
at
all
said
she
i
assure
you
it
is
not
done
intentionally
he
went
on
of
course
i
know
a
good
deal
about
babylon
and
i
unconsciously
communicate
it
to
you
you
ve
heard
of
but
some
of
the
things
you
say
i
don
t
understand
they
never
enter
my
head
and
yet
they
re
so
astoundingly
it
s
all
right
said
anthea
reassuringly
understand
and
don
t
worry
it
s
all
quite
simple
it
was
not
quite
so
simple
when
anthea
having
heard
the
others
come
in
went
down
and
before
she
had
had
time
to
ask
how
they
had
liked
the
zoo
heard
a
noise
outside
compared
to
which
the
wild
beasts
noises
were
gentle
as
singing
birds
good
gracious
cried
anthea
what
s
that
the
loud
hum
of
many
voices
came
through
the
open
window
words
could
be
distinguished
ere
s
a
guy
this
ain
t
november
that
ain
t
no
guy
it
s
a
ballet
lady
that
s
what
it
not
it
it
s
a
bloomin
looney
i
tell
then
came
a
clear
voice
that
they
knew
retire
slaves
it
said
what
s
she
a
saying
of
cried
a
dozen
voices
some
blamed
foreign
lingo
one
voice
replied
the
children
rushed
to
the
door
a
crowd
was
on
the
road
and
pavement
in
the
middle
of
the
crowd
plainly
to
be
seen
from
the
top
of
the
steps
were
the
beautiful
face
and
bright
veil
of
the
babylonian
queen
jimminy
cried
robert
and
ran
down
the
steps
here
she
is
here
he
cried
look
out
let
the
lady
pass
she
s
a
friend
of
ours
coming
to
see
nice
friend
for
a
respectable
house
snorted
a
fat
woman
with
marrows
on
a
handcart
all
the
same
the
crowd
made
way
a
little
the
queen
met
robert
on
the
pavement
and
cyril
joined
them
the
psammead
bag
still
on
his
arm
here
he
whispered
here
s
the
psammead
you
can
get
wish
you
d
come
in
a
different
dress
if
you
had
to
come
said
robert
but
it
s
no
use
my
wishing
no
said
the
queen
i
wish
i
was
dressed
no
i
don
t
i
wish
they
were
dressed
properly
then
they
wouldn
t
be
so
the
psammead
blew
itself
out
till
the
bag
was
a
very
tight
fit
for
it
and
suddenly
every
man
woman
and
child
in
that
crowd
felt
that
it
had
not
enough
clothes
on
for
of
course
the
queen
s
idea
of
proper
dress
was
the
dress
that
had
been
proper
for
the
years
ago
in
babylon
and
there
was
not
much
of
it
lawky
me
said
the
woman
whatever
could
me
to
come
out
this
figure
and
she
wheeled
her
cart
away
very
quickly
indeed
someone
s
made
a
pretty
guy
of
you
talk
of
guys
said
a
man
who
sold
bootlaces
well
don
t
you
talk
said
the
man
next
to
him
look
at
your
own
silly
legs
and
where
s
your
boots
i
never
come
out
like
this
i
ll
take
my
sacred
said
the
i
wasn
t
quite
myself
last
night
i
ll
own
but
not
to
dress
up
like
a
the
crowd
was
all
talking
at
once
and
getting
rather
angry
but
no
one
seemed
to
think
of
blaming
the
queen
anthea
bounded
down
the
steps
and
pulled
her
up
the
others
followed
and
the
door
was
shut
blowed
if
i
can
make
it
out
they
heard
i
m
off
home
i
and
the
crowd
coming
slowly
to
the
same
mind
dispersed
followed
by
another
crowd
of
persons
who
were
not
dressed
in
what
the
queen
thought
was
the
proper
way
we
shall
have
the
police
here
directly
said
anthea
in
the
tones
of
despair
oh
why
did
you
come
dressed
like
that
the
queen
leaned
against
the
arm
of
the
sofa
how
else
can
a
queen
dress
i
should
like
to
know
she
questioned
our
queen
wears
things
like
other
people
said
cyril
well
i
don
t
and
i
must
say
she
remarked
in
an
injured
tone
that
you
don
t
seem
very
glad
to
see
me
now
i
have
come
but
perhaps
it
s
the
surprise
that
makes
you
behave
like
this
yet
you
ought
to
be
used
to
surprises
the
way
you
vanished
i
shall
never
forget
it
the
best
magic
i
ve
ever
seen
how
did
you
do
it
oh
never
mind
about
that
now
said
robert
you
see
you
ve
gone
and
upset
all
those
people
and
i
expect
they
ll
fetch
the
police
and
we
don
t
want
to
see
you
collared
and
put
in
you
can
t
put
queens
in
prison
she
said
loftily
oh
can
t
you
said
cyril
we
cut
off
a
king
s
head
here
in
this
miserable
room
how
frightfully
no
no
not
in
this
room
in
oh
in
that
said
the
queen
disparagingly
i
thought
you
d
done
it
with
your
own
the
girls
shuddered
what
a
hideous
city
yours
is
the
queen
went
on
pleasantly
and
what
horrid
ignorant
people
do
you
know
they
actually
can
t
understand
a
single
word
i
can
you
understand
them
asked
jane
of
course
not
they
speak
some
vulgar
northern
dialect
i
can
understand
you
quite
i
really
am
not
going
to
explain
again
how
it
was
that
the
children
could
understand
other
languages
than
their
own
so
thoroughly
and
talk
them
too
so
that
it
felt
and
sounded
to
them
just
as
though
they
were
talking
english
well
said
cyril
bluntly
now
you
ve
seen
just
how
horrid
it
is
don
t
you
think
you
might
as
well
go
home
again
why
i
ve
seen
simply
nothing
yet
said
the
queen
arranging
her
starry
veil
i
wished
to
be
at
your
door
and
i
was
now
i
must
go
and
see
your
king
and
nobody
s
allowed
to
said
anthea
in
haste
but
look
here
we
ll
take
you
and
show
you
anything
you
d
like
to
see
anything
you
can
see
she
added
kindly
because
she
remembered
how
nice
the
queen
had
been
to
them
in
babylon
even
if
she
had
been
a
little
deceitful
in
the
matter
of
jane
and
psammead
there
s
the
museum
said
cyril
hopefully
there
are
lots
of
things
from
your
country
there
if
only
we
could
disguise
you
a
i
know
said
anthea
suddenly
mother
s
old
theatre
cloak
and
there
are
a
lot
of
her
old
hats
in
the
big
the
blue
silk
cloak
did
indeed
hide
some
of
the
queen
s
startling
splendours
but
the
hat
fitted
very
badly
it
had
pink
roses
in
it
and
there
was
something
about
the
coat
or
the
hat
or
the
queen
that
made
her
look
somehow
not
very
respectable
oh
never
mind
said
anthea
when
cyril
whispered
this
the
thing
is
to
get
her
out
before
nurse
has
finished
her
forty
winks
i
should
think
she
s
about
got
to
the
wink
by
come
on
then
said
robert
you
know
how
dangerous
it
is
let
s
make
haste
into
the
museum
if
any
of
those
people
you
made
guys
of
do
fetch
the
police
they
won
t
think
of
looking
for
you
the
blue
silk
coat
and
the
hat
attracted
almost
as
much
attention
as
the
royal
costume
had
done
and
the
children
were
uncommonly
glad
to
get
out
of
the
noisy
streets
into
the
grey
quiet
of
the
museum
parcels
and
umbrellas
to
be
left
here
said
a
man
at
the
counter
the
party
had
no
umbrellas
and
the
only
parcel
was
the
bag
containing
the
psammead
which
the
queen
had
insisted
should
be
brought
i
m
not
going
to
be
left
said
the
psammead
softly
so
don
t
you
think
i
ll
wait
outside
with
you
said
anthea
hastily
and
went
to
sit
on
the
seat
near
the
drinking
fountain
don
t
sit
so
near
that
nasty
fountain
said
the
creature
crossly
i
might
get
anthea
obediently
moved
to
another
seat
and
waited
indeed
she
waited
and
waited
and
waited
and
waited
and
waited
the
psammead
dropped
into
an
uneasy
slumber
anthea
had
long
ceased
to
watch
the
that
always
let
out
the
wrong
person
and
she
was
herself
almost
asleep
and
still
the
others
did
not
come
back
it
was
quite
a
start
when
anthea
suddenly
realized
that
they
had
come
back
and
that
they
were
not
alone
behind
them
was
quite
a
crowd
of
men
in
uniform
and
several
gentlemen
were
there
everyone
seemed
very
angry
now
go
said
the
nicest
of
the
angry
gentlemen
take
the
poor
demented
thing
home
and
tell
your
parents
she
ought
to
be
properly
looked
if
you
can
t
get
her
to
go
we
must
send
for
the
police
said
the
nastiest
gentleman
but
we
don
t
wish
to
use
harsh
measures
added
the
nice
one
who
was
really
very
nice
indeed
and
seemed
to
be
over
all
the
others
may
i
speak
to
my
sister
a
moment
first
asked
robert
the
nicest
gentleman
nodded
and
the
officials
stood
round
the
queen
the
others
forming
a
sort
of
guard
while
robert
crossed
over
to
anthea
everything
you
can
think
of
he
replied
to
anthea
s
glance
of
inquiry
kicked
up
the
most
frightful
shine
in
there
said
those
necklaces
and
earrings
and
things
in
the
glass
cases
were
all
hers
would
have
them
out
of
the
cases
tried
to
break
the
glass
she
did
break
one
bit
everybody
in
the
place
has
been
at
her
no
good
i
only
got
her
out
by
telling
her
that
was
the
place
where
they
cut
queens
heads
oh
bobs
what
a
whacker
you
d
have
told
a
whackinger
one
to
get
her
out
besides
it
wasn
t
i
meant
mummy
queens
how
do
you
know
they
don
t
cut
off
mummies
heads
to
see
how
the
embalming
is
done
what
i
want
to
say
is
can
t
you
get
her
to
go
with
you
quietly
i
ll
try
said
anthea
and
went
up
to
the
queen
do
come
home
she
said
the
learned
gentleman
in
our
house
has
a
much
nicer
necklace
than
anything
they
ve
got
here
come
and
see
the
queen
nodded
you
see
said
the
nastiest
gentleman
she
does
understand
i
was
talking
babylonian
i
think
said
anthea
bashfully
my
good
child
said
the
nice
gentleman
what
you
re
talking
is
not
babylonian
but
nonsense
you
just
go
home
at
once
and
tell
your
parents
exactly
what
has
anthea
took
the
queen
s
hand
and
gently
pulled
her
away
the
other
children
followed
and
the
black
crowd
of
angry
gentlemen
stood
on
the
steps
watching
them
it
was
when
the
little
party
of
disgraced
children
with
the
queen
who
had
disgraced
them
had
reached
the
middle
of
the
courtyard
that
her
eyes
fell
on
the
bag
where
the
psammead
was
she
stopped
short
i
wish
she
said
very
loud
and
clear
that
all
those
babylonian
things
would
come
out
to
me
here
slowly
so
that
those
dogs
and
slaves
can
see
the
working
of
the
great
queen
s
oh
you
are
a
tiresome
woman
said
the
psammead
in
its
bag
but
it
puffed
itself
out
next
moment
there
was
a
crash
the
glass
swing
doors
and
all
their
framework
were
smashed
suddenly
and
completely
the
crowd
of
angry
gentlemen
sprang
aside
when
they
saw
what
had
done
this
but
the
nastiest
of
them
was
not
quick
enough
and
he
was
roughly
pushed
out
of
the
way
by
an
enormous
stone
bull
that
was
floating
steadily
through
the
door
it
came
and
stood
beside
the
queen
in
the
middle
of
the
courtyard
it
was
followed
by
more
stone
images
by
great
slabs
of
carved
stone
bricks
helmets
tools
weapons
fetters
bowls
bottles
vases
jugs
saucers
seals
and
the
round
long
things
something
like
rolling
pins
with
marks
on
them
like
the
print
of
little
necklaces
collars
rings
armlets
earrings
heaps
and
heaps
and
heaps
of
things
far
more
than
anyone
had
time
to
count
or
even
to
see
distinctly
all
the
angry
gentlemen
had
abruptly
sat
down
on
the
museum
steps
except
the
nice
one
he
stood
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
just
as
though
he
was
quite
used
to
seeing
great
stone
bulls
and
all
sorts
of
small
babylonish
objects
float
out
into
the
museum
yard
but
he
sent
a
man
to
close
the
big
iron
gates
a
journalist
who
was
just
leaving
the
museum
spoke
to
robert
as
he
passed
theosophy
i
suppose
he
said
is
she
mrs
besant
yes
said
robert
recklessly
the
journalist
passed
through
the
gates
just
before
they
were
shut
he
rushed
off
to
fleet
street
and
his
paper
got
out
a
new
edition
within
half
an
hour
mrs
besant
and
theosophy
impertinent
miracle
at
the
british
museum
people
saw
it
in
fat
black
letters
on
the
boards
carried
by
the
sellers
of
newspapers
some
few
people
who
had
nothing
better
to
do
went
down
to
the
museum
on
the
tops
of
omnibuses
but
by
the
time
they
got
there
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
for
the
babylonian
queen
had
suddenly
seen
the
closed
gates
had
felt
the
threat
of
them
and
had
said
i
wish
we
were
in
your
and
of
course
instantly
they
were
the
psammead
was
furious
look
here
it
said
they
ll
come
after
you
and
they
ll
find
me
there
ll
be
a
national
cage
built
for
me
at
westminster
and
i
shall
have
to
work
at
politics
why
wouldn
t
you
leave
the
things
in
their
places
what
a
temper
you
have
haven
t
you
said
the
queen
serenely
i
wish
all
the
things
were
back
in
their
places
will
that
do
for
you
the
psammead
swelled
and
shrank
and
spoke
very
angrily
i
can
t
refuse
to
give
your
wishes
it
said
but
i
can
bite
and
i
will
if
this
goes
on
now
ah
don
t
whispered
anthea
close
to
its
bristling
ear
it
s
dreadful
for
us
too
don
t
you
desert
us
perhaps
she
ll
wish
herself
at
home
again
not
she
said
the
psammead
a
little
less
crossly
take
me
to
see
your
city
said
the
queen
the
children
looked
at
each
other
if
we
had
some
money
we
could
take
her
about
in
a
cab
people
wouldn
t
notice
her
so
much
then
but
we
haven
sell
this
said
the
queen
taking
a
ring
from
her
finger
they
d
only
think
we
d
stolen
it
said
cyril
bitterly
and
put
us
in
all
roads
lead
to
prison
with
you
it
seems
said
the
queen
the
learned
gentleman
said
anthea
and
ran
up
to
him
with
the
ring
in
her
hand
look
here
she
said
will
you
buy
this
for
a
pound
oh
he
said
in
tones
of
joy
and
amazement
and
took
the
ring
into
his
hand
it
s
my
very
own
said
anthea
it
was
given
to
me
to
i
ll
lend
you
a
pound
said
the
learned
gentleman
with
pleasure
and
i
ll
take
care
of
the
ring
for
you
who
did
you
say
gave
it
to
you
we
call
her
said
anthea
carefully
the
queen
of
is
it
a
game
he
asked
hopefully
it
ll
be
a
pretty
game
if
i
don
t
get
the
money
to
pay
for
cabs
for
her
said
anthea
i
sometimes
think
he
said
slowly
that
i
am
becoming
insane
or
that
or
that
i
am
but
i
m
not
and
you
re
not
and
she
s
does
she
say
that
she
s
the
queen
of
babylon
he
uneasily
asked
yes
said
anthea
recklessly
this
is
more
than
i
imagined
he
said
i
suppose
i
have
unconsciously
influenced
her
too
i
never
thought
my
babylonish
studies
would
bear
fruit
like
this
horrible
there
are
more
things
in
heaven
and
earth
yes
said
anthea
heaps
more
and
the
pound
is
the
thing
want
more
than
anything
on
he
ran
his
fingers
through
his
thin
hair
this
he
said
it
s
undoubtedly
a
babylonian
ring
or
it
seems
so
to
me
but
perhaps
i
have
hypnotized
myself
i
will
see
a
doctor
the
moment
i
have
corrected
the
last
proofs
of
my
yes
do
said
anthea
and
thank
you
so
very
she
took
the
sovereign
and
ran
down
to
the
others
and
now
from
the
window
of
a
cab
the
queen
of
babylon
beheld
the
wonders
of
london
buckingham
palace
she
thought
uninteresting
westminster
abbey
and
the
houses
of
parliament
little
better
but
she
liked
the
tower
and
the
river
and
the
ships
filled
her
with
wonder
and
delight
but
how
badly
you
keep
your
slaves
how
wretched
and
poor
and
neglected
they
seem
she
said
as
the
cab
rattled
along
the
mile
end
road
they
aren
t
slaves
they
re
said
jane
of
course
they
re
working
that
s
what
slaves
are
don
t
you
tell
me
do
you
suppose
i
don
t
know
a
slave
s
face
when
i
see
it
why
don
t
their
masters
see
that
they
re
better
fed
and
better
clothed
tell
me
in
three
no
one
answered
the
of
modern
england
is
a
little
difficult
to
explain
in
three
words
even
if
you
understand
it
which
the
children
didn
t
you
ll
have
a
revolt
of
your
slaves
if
you
re
not
careful
said
the
queen
oh
no
said
cyril
you
see
they
have
votes
that
makes
them
safe
not
to
revolt
it
makes
all
the
difference
father
told
me
what
is
this
vote
asked
the
queen
is
it
a
charm
what
do
they
do
with
it
i
don
t
know
said
the
harassed
cyril
it
s
just
a
vote
that
s
all
they
don
t
do
anything
particular
with
i
see
said
the
queen
a
sort
of
plaything
well
i
wish
that
all
these
slaves
may
have
in
their
hands
this
moment
their
fill
of
their
favourite
meat
and
instantly
all
the
people
in
the
mile
end
road
and
in
all
the
other
streets
where
poor
people
live
found
their
hands
full
of
things
to
eat
and
drink
from
the
cab
window
could
be
seen
persons
carrying
every
kind
of
food
and
bottles
and
cans
as
well
roast
meat
fowls
red
lobsters
great
yellowy
crabs
fried
fish
boiled
pork
puddings
baked
onions
mutton
pies
most
of
the
young
people
had
oranges
and
sweets
and
cake
it
made
an
enormous
change
in
the
look
of
the
mile
end
road
brightened
it
up
so
to
speak
and
brightened
up
more
than
you
can
possibly
imagine
the
faces
of
the
people
makes
a
difference
doesn
t
it
said
the
queen
that
s
the
best
wish
you
ve
had
yet
said
jane
with
cordial
approval
just
by
the
bank
the
cabman
stopped
i
ain
t
agoin
to
drive
you
no
further
he
said
out
you
they
got
out
rather
unwillingly
i
wants
my
tea
he
said
and
they
saw
that
on
the
box
of
the
cab
was
a
mound
of
cabbage
with
pork
chops
and
apple
sauce
a
duck
and
a
spotted
currant
pudding
also
a
large
can
you
pay
me
my
fare
he
said
threateningly
and
looked
down
at
the
mound
muttering
again
about
his
tea
we
ll
take
another
cab
said
cyril
with
dignity
give
me
change
for
a
sovereign
if
you
but
the
cabman
as
it
turned
out
was
not
at
all
a
nice
character
he
took
the
sovereign
whipped
up
his
horse
and
disappeared
in
the
stream
of
cabs
and
omnibuses
and
wagons
without
giving
them
any
change
at
all
already
a
little
crowd
was
collecting
round
the
party
come
on
said
robert
leading
the
wrong
way
the
crowd
round
them
thickened
they
were
in
a
narrow
street
where
many
gentlemen
in
black
coats
and
without
hats
were
standing
about
on
the
pavement
talking
very
loudly
how
ugly
their
clothes
are
said
the
queen
of
babylon
they
d
be
rather
fine
men
some
of
them
if
they
were
dressed
decently
especially
the
ones
with
the
beautiful
long
curved
noses
i
wish
they
were
dressed
like
the
babylonians
of
my
and
of
course
it
was
so
the
moment
the
almost
fainting
psammead
had
blown
itself
out
every
man
in
throgmorton
street
appeared
abruptly
in
babylonian
full
dress
all
were
carefully
powdered
their
hair
and
beards
were
scented
and
curled
their
garments
richly
embroidered
they
wore
rings
and
armlets
flat
gold
collars
and
swords
and
a
stupefied
silence
fell
on
them
i
say
a
youth
who
had
always
been
broke
that
silence
it
s
only
fancy
of
course
something
wrong
with
my
eyes
but
you
chaps
do
look
so
rum
said
his
friend
look
at
you
you
in
a
sash
my
hat
and
your
hair
s
gone
black
and
you
ve
got
a
beard
it
s
my
belief
we
ve
been
poisoned
you
do
look
a
old
levinstein
don
t
look
so
bad
but
how
was
it
done
that
s
what
i
want
to
know
how
was
it
done
is
it
conjuring
or
what
i
think
it
is
chust
a
ver
bad
tream
said
old
levinstein
to
his
clerk
all
along
bishopsgate
i
haf
seen
the
gommon
people
have
their
hants
full
of
food
goot
food
oh
yes
without
doubt
a
very
bad
tream
then
i
m
dreaming
too
sir
said
the
clerk
looking
down
at
his
legs
with
an
expression
of
loathing
i
see
my
feet
in
beastly
sandals
as
plain
as
all
that
goot
food
wasted
said
old
mr
levinstein
a
bad
tream
a
bad
the
members
of
the
stock
exchange
are
said
to
be
at
all
times
a
noisy
lot
but
the
noise
they
made
now
to
express
their
disgust
at
the
costumes
of
ancient
babylon
was
far
louder
than
their
ordinary
row
one
had
to
shout
before
one
could
hear
oneself
speak
i
only
wish
said
the
clerk
who
thought
it
was
conjuring
he
was
quite
close
to
the
children
and
they
trembled
because
they
knew
that
whatever
he
wished
would
come
true
i
only
wish
we
knew
who
d
done
and
of
course
instantly
they
did
know
and
they
pressed
round
the
queen
scandalous
shameful
ought
to
be
put
down
by
law
give
her
in
charge
fetch
the
police
two
or
three
voices
shouted
at
once
the
queen
recoiled
what
is
it
she
asked
they
sound
like
caged
lions
lions
by
the
thousand
what
is
it
that
they
say
they
say
police
said
cyril
briefly
i
knew
they
would
sooner
or
later
and
i
don
t
blame
them
mind
i
wish
my
guards
were
here
cried
the
queen
the
exhausted
psammead
was
panting
and
trembling
but
the
queen
s
guards
in
red
and
green
garments
and
brass
and
iron
gear
choked
throgmorton
street
and
bared
weapons
flashed
round
the
queen
i
m
mad
said
a
mr
rosenbaum
dat
s
what
it
is
mad
it
s
a
judgement
on
you
rosy
said
his
partner
i
always
said
you
were
too
hard
in
that
matter
of
flowerdew
it
s
a
judgement
and
i
m
in
it
the
members
of
the
stock
exchange
had
edged
carefully
away
from
the
gleaming
blades
the
mailed
figures
the
hard
cruel
eastern
faces
but
throgmorton
street
is
narrow
and
the
crowd
was
too
thick
for
them
to
get
away
as
quickly
as
they
wished
kill
them
cried
the
queen
kill
the
dogs
the
guards
obeyed
it
is
all
a
dream
cried
mr
levinstein
cowering
in
a
doorway
behind
his
clerk
it
isn
t
said
the
clerk
it
isn
t
oh
my
good
gracious
those
foreign
brutes
are
killing
everybody
henry
hirsh
is
down
now
and
prentice
is
cut
in
two
oh
lord
and
huth
and
there
goes
lionel
cohen
with
his
head
off
and
guy
nickalls
has
lost
his
head
now
a
dream
i
wish
to
goodness
it
was
all
a
and
of
course
instantly
it
was
the
entire
stock
exchange
rubbed
its
eyes
and
went
back
to
close
to
over
and
either
side
of
and
trunks
and
kaffirs
and
steel
common
and
contangoes
and
backwardations
double
options
and
all
the
interesting
subjects
concerning
which
they
talk
in
the
street
without
ceasing
no
one
said
a
word
about
it
to
anyone
else
i
think
i
have
explained
before
that
business
men
do
not
like
it
to
be
known
that
they
have
been
dreaming
in
business
hours
especially
mad
dreams
including
such
dreadful
things
as
hungry
people
getting
dinners
and
the
destruction
of
the
stock
exchange
the
children
were
in
the
at
fitzroy
street
pale
and
trembling
the
psammead
crawled
out
of
the
embroidered
bag
and
lay
flat
on
the
table
its
leg
stretched
out
looking
more
like
a
dead
hare
than
anything
else
thank
goodness
that
s
over
said
anthea
drawing
a
deep
breath
she
won
t
come
back
will
she
asked
jane
tremulously
no
said
cyril
she
s
thousands
of
years
ago
but
we
spent
a
whole
precious
pound
on
her
it
ll
take
all
our
for
ages
to
pay
that
not
if
it
was
all
a
dream
said
robert
the
wish
said
all
a
dream
you
know
panther
you
cut
up
and
ask
if
he
lent
you
i
beg
your
pardon
said
anthea
politely
following
the
sound
of
her
knock
into
the
presence
of
the
learned
gentleman
i
m
so
sorry
to
trouble
you
but
did
you
lend
me
a
pound
today
no
said
he
looking
kindly
at
her
through
his
spectacles
but
it
s
extraordinary
that
you
should
ask
me
for
i
dozed
for
a
few
moments
this
afternoon
a
thing
i
very
rarely
do
and
i
dreamed
quite
distinctly
that
you
brought
me
a
ring
that
you
said
belonged
to
the
queen
of
babylon
and
that
i
lent
you
a
sovereign
and
that
you
left
one
of
the
queen
s
rings
here
the
ring
was
a
magnificent
he
sighed
i
wish
it
hadn
t
been
a
dream
he
said
smiling
he
was
really
learning
to
smile
quite
nicely
anthea
could
not
be
too
thankful
that
the
psammead
was
not
there
to
grant
his
wish
chapter
atlantis
you
will
understand
that
the
adventure
of
the
babylonian
queen
in
london
was
the
only
one
that
had
occupied
any
time
at
all
but
the
children
s
time
was
very
fully
taken
up
by
talking
over
all
the
wonderful
things
seen
and
done
in
the
past
where
by
the
power
of
the
amulet
they
seemed
to
spend
hours
and
hours
only
to
find
when
they
got
back
to
london
that
the
whole
thing
had
been
briefer
than
a
lightning
flash
they
talked
of
the
past
at
their
meals
in
their
walks
in
the
in
the
but
most
of
all
on
the
stairs
it
was
an
old
house
it
had
once
been
a
fashionable
one
and
was
a
fine
one
still
the
banister
rails
of
the
stairs
were
excellent
for
sliding
down
and
in
the
corners
of
the
landings
were
big
alcoves
that
had
once
held
graceful
statues
and
now
quite
often
held
the
graceful
forms
of
cyril
robert
anthea
and
jane
one
day
cyril
and
robert
in
tight
white
underclothing
had
spent
a
pleasant
hour
in
reproducing
the
attitudes
of
statues
seen
either
in
the
british
museum
or
in
father
s
big
photograph
book
but
the
show
ended
abruptly
because
robert
wanted
to
be
the
venus
of
milo
and
for
this
purpose
pulled
at
the
sheet
which
served
for
drapery
at
the
very
moment
when
cyril
looking
really
quite
like
the
discobolos
with
a
gold
and
white
saucer
for
the
disc
was
standing
on
one
foot
and
under
that
one
foot
was
the
sheet
of
course
the
discobolos
and
his
disc
and
the
venus
came
down
together
and
everyone
was
a
good
deal
hurt
especially
the
saucer
which
would
never
be
the
same
again
however
neatly
one
might
join
its
uneven
bits
with
seccotine
or
the
white
of
an
egg
i
hope
you
re
satisfied
said
cyril
holding
his
head
where
a
large
lump
was
rising
quite
thanks
said
robert
bitterly
his
thumb
had
caught
in
the
banisters
and
bent
itself
back
almost
to
breaking
point
i
am
so
sorry
poor
dear
squirrel
said
anthea
and
you
were
looking
so
lovely
i
ll
get
a
wet
rag
bobs
go
and
hold
your
hand
under
the
tap
it
s
what
ballet
girls
do
with
their
legs
when
they
hurt
them
i
saw
it
in
a
what
book
said
robert
disagreeably
but
he
went
when
he
came
back
cyril
s
head
had
been
bandaged
by
his
sisters
and
he
had
been
brought
to
the
state
of
mind
where
he
was
able
reluctantly
to
admit
that
he
supposed
robert
hadn
t
done
it
on
purpose
robert
replying
with
equal
suavity
anthea
hastened
to
lead
the
talk
away
from
the
accident
i
suppose
you
don
t
feel
like
going
anywhere
through
the
amulet
she
said
egypt
said
jane
promptly
i
want
to
see
the
pussy
not
me
too
hot
said
cyril
it
s
about
as
much
as
i
can
stand
here
let
alone
it
was
indeed
hot
even
on
the
second
landing
which
was
the
coolest
place
in
the
house
let
s
go
to
the
north
i
don
t
suppose
the
amulet
was
ever
there
and
we
might
get
our
fingers
so
that
we
could
never
hold
it
up
to
get
home
again
no
thanks
said
robert
i
say
said
jane
let
s
get
the
psammead
and
ask
its
advice
it
will
like
us
asking
even
if
we
don
t
take
the
psammead
was
brought
up
in
its
green
silk
embroidered
bag
but
before
it
could
be
asked
anything
the
door
of
the
learned
gentleman
s
room
opened
and
the
voice
of
the
visitor
who
had
been
lunching
with
him
was
heard
on
the
stairs
he
seemed
to
be
speaking
with
the
door
handle
in
his
hand
you
see
a
doctor
old
boy
he
said
all
that
about
is
just
simply
twaddle
you
ve
been
take
a
holiday
go
to
i
d
rather
go
to
babylon
said
the
learned
gentleman
i
wish
you
d
go
to
atlantis
some
time
while
we
re
about
it
so
as
to
give
me
some
tips
for
my
nineteenth
century
article
when
you
come
i
wish
i
could
said
the
voice
of
the
learned
gentleman
goodbye
take
care
of
the
door
was
banged
and
the
visitor
came
smiling
down
the
stairs
a
stout
prosperous
big
man
the
children
had
to
get
up
to
let
him
pass
hullo
kiddies
he
said
glancing
at
the
bandages
on
the
head
of
cyril
and
the
hand
of
robert
been
in
the
wars
it
s
all
right
said
cyril
i
say
what
was
that
atlantic
place
you
wanted
him
to
go
to
we
couldn
t
help
hearing
you
you
talk
so
very
loud
you
see
said
jane
soothingly
atlantis
said
the
visitor
the
lost
atlantis
garden
of
the
hesperides
great
continent
disappeared
in
the
sea
you
can
read
about
it
in
thank
you
said
cyril
doubtfully
were
there
any
amulets
there
asked
anthea
made
anxious
by
a
sudden
thought
hundreds
i
should
think
so
he
s
been
talking
to
you
yes
often
he
s
very
kind
to
us
we
like
him
well
what
he
wants
is
a
holiday
you
persuade
him
to
take
one
what
he
wants
is
a
change
of
scene
you
see
his
head
is
crusted
so
thickly
inside
with
knowledge
about
egypt
and
assyria
and
things
that
you
can
t
hammer
anything
into
it
unless
you
keep
hard
at
it
all
day
long
for
days
and
days
and
i
haven
t
time
but
you
live
in
the
house
you
can
hammer
almost
incessantly
just
try
your
hands
will
you
right
so
long
he
went
down
the
stairs
three
at
a
time
and
jane
remarked
that
he
was
a
nice
man
and
she
thought
he
had
little
girls
of
his
own
i
should
like
to
have
them
to
play
with
she
added
pensively
the
three
elder
ones
exchanged
glances
cyril
nodded
all
right
let
s
go
to
atlantis
he
said
let
s
go
to
atlantis
and
take
the
learned
gentleman
with
us
said
anthea
he
ll
think
it
s
a
dream
afterwards
but
it
ll
certainly
be
a
change
of
why
not
take
him
to
nice
egypt
asked
jane
too
hot
said
cyril
shortly
or
babylon
where
he
wants
to
go
i
ve
had
enough
of
babylon
said
robert
at
least
for
the
present
and
so
have
the
others
i
don
t
know
why
he
added
forestalling
the
question
on
jane
s
lips
but
somehow
we
have
squirrel
let
s
take
off
these
beastly
bandages
and
get
into
flannels
we
can
t
go
in
our
he
wished
to
go
to
atlantis
so
he
s
got
to
go
some
time
and
he
might
as
well
go
with
us
said
anthea
this
was
how
it
was
that
the
learned
gentleman
permitting
himself
a
few
moments
of
relaxation
in
his
chair
after
the
fatigue
of
listening
to
opinions
about
atlantis
and
many
other
things
with
which
he
did
not
at
all
agree
opened
his
eyes
to
find
his
four
young
friends
standing
in
front
of
him
in
a
row
will
you
come
said
anthea
to
atlantis
with
us
to
know
that
you
are
dreaming
shows
that
the
dream
is
nearly
at
an
end
he
told
himself
or
perhaps
it
s
only
a
game
like
how
many
miles
to
babylon
so
he
said
aloud
thank
you
very
much
but
i
have
only
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
it
doesn
t
take
any
time
said
cyril
time
is
only
a
mode
of
thought
you
know
and
you
ve
got
to
go
some
time
so
why
not
with
us
very
well
said
the
learned
gentleman
now
quite
certain
that
he
was
dreaming
anthea
held
out
her
soft
pink
hand
he
took
it
she
pulled
him
gently
to
his
feet
jane
held
up
the
amulet
to
just
outside
atlantis
said
cyril
and
jane
said
the
name
of
power
you
owl
said
robert
it
s
an
island
outside
an
island
s
all
i
won
t
go
i
won
t
said
the
psammead
kicking
and
struggling
in
its
bag
but
already
the
amulet
had
grown
to
a
great
arch
cyril
pushed
the
learned
gentleman
as
undoubtedly
the
through
the
arch
not
into
water
but
on
to
a
wooden
floor
out
of
doors
the
others
followed
the
amulet
grew
smaller
again
and
there
they
all
were
standing
on
the
deck
of
a
ship
whose
sailors
were
busy
making
her
fast
with
chains
to
rings
on
a
white
the
rings
and
the
chains
were
of
a
metal
that
shone
like
gold
everyone
on
the
ship
seemed
too
busy
at
first
to
notice
the
group
of
newcomers
from
fitzroy
street
those
who
seemed
to
be
officers
were
shouting
orders
to
the
men
they
stood
and
looked
across
the
wide
quay
to
the
town
that
rose
beyond
it
what
they
saw
was
the
most
beautiful
sight
any
of
them
had
ever
seen
or
ever
dreamed
of
the
blue
sea
sparkled
in
soft
sunlight
little
waves
broke
softly
against
the
marble
breakwaters
that
guarded
the
shipping
of
a
great
city
from
the
wilderness
of
winter
winds
and
seas
the
quay
was
of
marble
white
and
sparkling
with
a
veining
bright
as
gold
the
city
was
of
marble
red
and
white
the
greater
buildings
that
seemed
to
be
temples
and
palaces
were
roofed
with
what
looked
like
gold
and
silver
but
most
of
the
roofs
were
of
copper
that
glowed
on
the
houses
on
the
hills
among
which
the
city
stood
and
shaded
into
marvellous
tints
of
green
and
blue
and
purple
where
they
had
been
touched
by
the
salt
sea
spray
and
the
fumes
of
the
dyeing
and
smelting
works
of
the
lower
town
broad
and
magnificent
flights
of
marble
stairs
led
up
from
the
quay
to
a
sort
of
terrace
that
seemed
to
run
along
for
miles
and
beyond
rose
the
town
built
on
a
hill
the
learned
gentleman
drew
a
long
breath
wonderful
he
said
wonderful
i
say
mr
what
s
your
name
said
robert
he
means
said
anthea
with
gentle
politeness
that
we
never
can
remember
your
name
i
know
it
s
mr
de
when
i
was
your
age
i
was
called
jimmy
he
said
timidly
would
you
mind
i
should
feel
more
at
home
in
a
dream
like
this
if
i
anything
that
made
me
seem
more
like
one
of
thank
you
jimmy
said
anthea
with
an
effort
it
seemed
such
a
cheek
to
be
saying
jimmy
to
a
man
jimmy
dear
she
added
with
no
effort
at
all
jimmy
smiled
and
looked
pleased
but
now
the
ship
was
made
fast
and
the
captain
had
time
to
notice
other
things
he
came
towards
them
and
he
was
dressed
in
the
best
of
all
possible
dresses
for
the
seafaring
life
what
are
you
doing
here
he
asked
rather
fiercely
do
you
come
to
bless
or
to
curse
to
bless
of
course
said
cyril
i
m
sorry
if
it
annoys
you
but
we
re
here
by
magic
we
come
from
the
land
of
the
he
went
on
explanatorily
i
see
said
the
captain
no
one
had
expected
that
he
would
i
didn
t
notice
at
first
but
of
course
i
hope
you
re
a
good
omen
it
s
needed
and
this
he
pointed
to
the
learned
gentleman
your
slave
i
presume
not
at
all
said
anthea
he
s
a
very
great
man
a
sage
don
t
they
call
it
and
we
want
to
see
all
your
beautiful
city
and
your
temples
and
things
and
then
we
shall
go
back
and
he
will
tell
his
friend
and
his
friend
will
write
a
book
about
what
asked
the
captain
fingering
a
rope
is
a
book
a
record
something
written
or
she
added
hastily
remembering
the
babylonian
writing
or
some
sudden
impulse
of
confidence
made
jane
pluck
the
amulet
from
the
neck
of
her
frock
like
this
she
said
the
captain
looked
at
it
curiously
but
the
other
three
were
relieved
to
notice
without
any
of
that
overwhelming
interest
which
the
mere
name
of
it
had
roused
in
egypt
and
babylon
the
stone
is
of
our
country
he
said
and
that
which
is
engraved
on
it
it
is
like
our
writing
but
i
can
not
read
it
what
is
the
name
of
your
sage
said
anthea
hesitatingly
the
captain
repeated
will
you
land
he
added
and
shall
i
lead
you
to
the
kings
look
here
said
robert
does
your
king
hate
strangers
our
kings
are
ten
said
the
captain
and
the
royal
line
unbroken
from
poseidon
the
father
of
us
all
has
the
noble
tradition
to
do
honour
to
strangers
if
they
come
in
then
lead
on
please
said
robert
though
i
should
like
to
see
all
over
your
beautiful
ship
and
sail
about
in
that
shall
be
later
said
the
captain
just
now
we
re
afraid
of
a
storm
do
you
notice
that
odd
rumbling
that
s
nothing
master
said
an
old
sailor
who
stood
near
it
s
the
pilchards
coming
in
that
s
too
loud
said
the
captain
there
was
a
rather
anxious
pause
then
the
captain
stepped
on
to
the
quay
and
the
others
followed
him
do
talk
to
him
jimmy
said
anthea
as
they
went
you
can
find
out
all
sorts
of
things
for
your
friend
s
please
excuse
me
he
said
earnestly
if
i
talk
i
shall
wake
up
and
besides
i
can
t
understand
what
he
no
one
else
could
think
of
anything
to
say
so
that
it
was
in
complete
silence
that
they
followed
the
captain
up
the
marble
steps
and
through
the
streets
of
the
town
there
were
streets
and
shops
and
houses
and
markets
it
s
just
like
babylon
whispered
jane
only
everything
s
perfectly
it
s
a
great
comfort
the
ten
kings
have
been
properly
brought
up
to
be
kind
to
strangers
anthea
whispered
to
cyril
yes
he
said
no
deepest
dungeons
there
were
no
horses
or
chariots
in
the
street
but
there
were
handcarts
and
low
trolleys
running
on
thick
and
porters
carrying
packets
on
their
heads
and
a
good
many
of
the
people
were
riding
on
what
looked
like
elephants
only
the
great
beasts
were
hairy
and
they
had
not
that
mild
expression
we
are
accustomed
to
meet
on
the
faces
of
the
elephants
at
the
zoo
mammoths
murmured
the
learned
gentleman
and
stumbled
over
a
loose
stone
the
people
in
the
streets
kept
crowding
round
them
as
they
went
along
but
the
captain
always
dispersed
the
crowd
before
it
grew
uncomfortably
thick
by
saying
children
of
the
sun
god
and
their
high
priest
come
to
bless
the
and
then
the
people
would
draw
back
with
a
low
murmur
that
sounded
like
a
suppressed
cheer
many
of
the
buildings
were
covered
with
gold
but
the
gold
on
the
bigger
buildings
was
of
a
different
colour
and
they
had
sorts
of
steeples
of
burnished
silver
rising
above
them
are
all
these
houses
real
gold
asked
jane
the
temples
are
covered
with
gold
of
course
answered
the
captain
but
the
houses
are
only
oricalchum
it
s
not
quite
so
the
learned
gentleman
now
very
pale
stumbled
along
in
a
dazed
way
repeating
oricalchum
don
t
be
frightened
said
anthea
we
can
get
home
in
a
minute
just
by
holding
up
the
charm
would
you
rather
go
back
now
we
could
easily
come
some
other
day
without
oh
no
no
he
pleaded
fervently
let
the
dream
go
on
please
please
the
high
is
perhaps
weary
with
his
magic
journey
said
the
captain
noticing
the
blundering
walk
of
the
learned
gentleman
and
we
are
yet
very
far
from
the
great
temple
where
today
the
kings
make
he
stopped
at
the
gate
of
a
great
enclosure
it
seemed
to
be
a
sort
of
park
for
trees
showed
high
above
its
brazen
wall
the
party
waited
and
almost
at
once
the
captain
came
back
with
one
of
the
hairy
elephants
and
begged
them
to
mount
this
they
did
it
was
a
glorious
ride
the
elephant
at
the
zoo
to
ride
on
him
is
also
glorious
but
he
goes
such
a
very
little
way
and
then
he
goes
back
again
which
is
always
dull
but
this
great
hairy
beast
went
on
and
on
and
on
along
streets
and
through
squares
and
gardens
it
was
a
glorious
city
almost
everything
was
built
of
marble
red
or
white
or
black
every
now
and
then
the
party
crossed
a
bridge
it
was
not
till
they
had
climbed
to
the
hill
which
is
the
centre
of
the
town
that
they
saw
that
the
whole
city
was
divided
into
twenty
circles
alternately
land
and
water
and
over
each
of
the
water
circles
were
the
bridges
by
which
they
had
come
and
now
they
were
in
a
great
square
a
vast
building
filled
up
one
side
of
it
it
was
overlaid
with
gold
and
had
a
dome
of
silver
the
rest
of
the
buildings
round
the
square
were
of
oricalchum
and
it
looked
more
splendid
than
you
can
possibly
imagine
standing
up
bold
and
shining
in
the
sunlight
you
would
like
a
bath
said
the
captain
as
the
hairy
elephant
went
clumsily
down
on
his
knees
it
s
customary
you
know
before
entering
the
presence
we
have
baths
for
men
women
horses
and
cattle
the
high
class
baths
are
here
our
father
poseidon
gave
us
a
spring
of
hot
water
and
one
of
the
children
had
never
before
bathed
in
baths
of
gold
it
feels
very
splendid
said
cyril
splashing
at
least
of
course
it
s
not
gold
it
s
or
what
s
its
name
said
robert
hand
over
that
the
bathing
hall
had
several
great
pools
sunk
below
the
level
of
the
floor
one
went
down
to
them
by
steps
jimmy
said
anthea
timidly
when
very
clean
and
they
all
met
in
the
flowery
courtyard
of
the
public
don
t
you
think
all
this
seems
much
more
like
now
than
babylon
or
egypt
oh
i
forgot
you
ve
never
been
i
know
a
little
of
those
nations
however
said
he
and
i
quite
agree
with
you
a
most
discerning
remark
my
dear
he
added
awkwardly
this
city
certainly
seems
to
indicate
a
far
higher
level
of
civilization
than
the
egyptian
or
babylonish
and
follow
me
said
the
captain
now
boys
get
out
of
the
he
pushed
through
a
little
crowd
of
boys
who
were
playing
with
dried
chestnuts
fastened
to
a
string
ginger
remarked
robert
they
re
playing
conkers
just
like
the
kids
in
kentish
town
road
they
could
see
now
that
three
walls
surrounded
the
island
on
which
they
were
the
outermost
wall
was
of
brass
the
captain
told
them
the
next
which
looked
like
silver
was
covered
with
tin
and
the
innermost
one
was
of
oricalchum
and
right
in
the
middle
was
a
wall
of
gold
with
golden
towers
and
gates
behold
the
temples
of
poseidon
said
the
captain
it
is
not
lawful
for
me
to
enter
i
will
await
your
return
he
told
them
what
they
ought
to
say
and
the
five
people
from
fitzroy
street
took
hands
and
went
forward
the
golden
gates
slowly
opened
we
are
the
children
of
the
sun
said
cyril
as
he
had
been
told
and
our
high
priest
at
least
that
s
what
the
captain
calls
him
we
have
a
different
name
for
him
at
what
is
his
name
asked
a
man
who
stood
in
the
doorway
with
his
arms
extended
replied
cyril
and
he
hesitated
as
anthea
had
done
it
really
did
seem
to
be
taking
a
great
liberty
with
so
learned
a
gentleman
and
we
have
come
to
speak
with
your
kings
in
the
temple
of
poseidon
does
that
word
sound
right
he
whispered
anxiously
quite
said
the
learned
gentleman
it
s
very
odd
i
can
understand
what
you
say
to
them
but
not
what
they
say
to
the
queen
of
babylon
found
that
too
said
cyril
it
s
part
of
the
oh
what
a
dream
said
the
learned
gentleman
the
priest
had
been
joined
by
others
and
all
were
bowing
low
enter
he
said
enter
children
of
the
sun
with
your
high
in
an
inner
courtyard
stood
the
temple
all
of
silver
with
gold
pinnacles
and
doors
and
twenty
enormous
statues
in
bright
gold
of
men
and
women
also
an
immense
pillar
of
the
other
precious
yellow
metal
they
went
through
the
doors
and
the
priest
led
them
up
a
stair
into
a
gallery
from
which
they
could
look
down
on
to
the
glorious
place
the
ten
kings
are
even
now
choosing
the
bull
it
is
not
lawful
for
me
to
behold
said
the
priest
and
fell
face
downward
on
the
floor
outside
the
gallery
the
children
looked
down
the
roof
was
of
ivory
adorned
with
the
three
precious
metals
and
the
walls
were
lined
with
the
favourite
oricalchum
at
the
far
end
of
the
temple
was
a
statue
group
the
like
of
which
no
one
living
has
ever
seen
it
was
of
gold
and
the
head
of
the
chief
figure
reached
to
the
roof
that
figure
was
poseidon
the
father
of
the
city
he
stood
in
a
great
chariot
drawn
by
six
enormous
horses
and
round
about
it
were
a
hundred
mermaids
riding
on
dolphins
ten
men
splendidly
dressed
and
armed
only
with
sticks
and
ropes
were
trying
to
capture
one
of
some
fifteen
bulls
who
ran
this
way
and
that
about
the
floor
of
the
temple
the
children
held
their
breath
for
the
bulls
looked
dangerous
and
the
great
horned
heads
were
swinging
more
and
more
wildly
anthea
did
not
like
looking
at
the
bulls
she
looked
about
the
gallery
and
noticed
that
another
staircase
led
up
from
it
to
a
still
higher
storey
also
that
a
door
led
out
into
the
open
air
where
there
seemed
to
be
a
balcony
so
that
when
a
shout
went
up
and
robert
whispered
got
him
and
she
looked
down
and
saw
the
herd
of
bulls
being
driven
out
of
the
temple
by
whips
and
the
ten
kings
following
one
of
them
spurring
with
his
stick
a
black
bull
that
writhed
and
fought
in
the
grip
of
a
lasso
she
answered
the
boy
s
agitated
now
we
shan
t
see
anything
more
with
yes
we
can
there
s
an
outside
so
they
crowded
out
but
very
soon
the
girls
crept
back
i
don
t
like
sacrifices
jane
said
so
she
and
anthea
went
and
talked
to
the
priest
who
was
no
longer
lying
on
his
face
but
sitting
on
the
top
step
mopping
his
forehead
with
his
robe
for
it
was
a
hot
day
it
s
a
special
sacrifice
he
said
usually
it
s
only
done
on
the
justice
days
every
five
years
and
six
years
alternately
and
then
they
drink
the
cup
of
wine
with
some
of
the
bull
s
blood
in
it
and
swear
to
judge
truly
and
they
wear
the
sacred
blue
robe
and
put
out
all
the
temple
fires
but
this
today
is
because
the
city
s
so
upset
by
the
odd
noises
from
the
sea
and
the
god
inside
the
big
mountain
speaking
with
his
but
all
that
s
happened
so
often
before
if
anything
could
make
me
uneasy
it
wouldn
t
be
what
would
it
be
asked
jane
kindly
it
would
be
the
who
are
they
enemies
they
re
a
sort
of
rat
and
every
year
they
come
swimming
over
from
the
country
that
no
man
knows
and
stay
here
awhile
and
then
swim
away
this
year
they
haven
t
come
you
know
rats
won
t
stay
on
a
ship
that
s
going
to
be
wrecked
if
anything
horrible
were
going
to
happen
to
us
it
s
my
belief
those
lemmings
would
know
and
that
may
be
why
they
ve
fought
shy
of
what
do
you
call
this
country
asked
the
psammead
suddenly
putting
its
head
out
of
its
bag
atlantis
said
the
priest
then
i
advise
you
to
get
on
to
the
highest
ground
you
can
find
i
remember
hearing
something
about
a
flood
here
look
here
you
it
turned
to
anthea
let
s
get
home
the
prospect
s
too
wet
for
my
the
girls
obediently
went
to
find
their
brothers
who
were
leaning
on
the
balcony
railings
where
s
the
learned
gentleman
asked
anthea
there
he
is
below
said
the
priest
who
had
come
with
them
your
high
is
with
the
the
ten
kings
were
no
longer
alone
the
learned
gentleman
no
one
had
noticed
how
he
got
there
stood
with
them
on
the
steps
of
an
altar
on
which
lay
the
dead
body
of
the
black
bull
all
the
rest
of
the
courtyard
was
thick
with
people
seemingly
of
all
classes
and
all
were
shouting
the
sea
the
sea
be
calm
said
the
most
kingly
of
the
kings
he
who
had
lassoed
the
bull
our
town
is
strong
against
the
thunders
of
the
sea
and
of
the
sky
i
want
to
go
home
whined
the
psammead
we
can
t
go
without
him
said
anthea
firmly
jimmy
she
called
jimmy
and
waved
to
him
he
heard
her
and
began
to
come
towards
her
through
the
crowd
they
could
see
from
the
balcony
the
edging
his
way
out
from
among
the
people
and
his
face
was
dead
white
like
paper
to
the
hills
he
cried
in
a
loud
and
terrible
voice
and
above
his
voice
came
another
voice
louder
more
terrible
the
voice
of
the
sea
the
girls
looked
seaward
across
the
smooth
distance
of
the
sea
something
huge
and
black
rolled
towards
the
town
it
was
a
wave
but
a
wave
a
hundred
feet
in
height
a
wave
that
looked
like
a
mountain
a
wave
rising
higher
and
higher
till
suddenly
it
seemed
to
break
in
two
one
half
of
it
rushed
out
to
sea
again
the
other
oh
cried
anthea
the
town
the
poor
people
it
s
all
thousands
of
years
ago
really
said
robert
but
his
voice
trembled
they
hid
their
eyes
for
a
moment
they
could
not
bear
to
look
down
for
the
wave
had
broken
on
the
face
of
the
town
sweeping
over
the
quays
and
docks
overwhelming
the
great
storehouses
and
factories
tearing
gigantic
stones
from
forts
and
bridges
and
using
them
as
battering
rams
against
the
temples
great
ships
were
swept
over
the
roofs
of
the
houses
and
dashed
down
halfway
up
the
hill
among
ruined
gardens
and
broken
buildings
the
water
ground
brown
to
powder
on
the
golden
roofs
of
palaces
then
the
wave
swept
back
towards
the
sea
i
want
to
go
home
cried
the
psammead
fiercely
oh
yes
yes
said
jane
and
the
boys
were
ready
but
the
learned
gentleman
had
not
come
then
suddenly
they
heard
him
dash
up
to
the
inner
gallery
crying
i
must
see
the
end
of
the
he
rushed
up
the
higher
flight
the
others
followed
him
they
found
themselves
in
a
sort
of
turret
roofed
but
open
to
the
air
at
the
sides
the
learned
gentleman
was
leaning
on
the
parapet
and
as
they
rejoined
him
the
vast
wave
rushed
back
on
the
town
this
time
it
rose
higher
destroyed
more
come
home
cried
the
psammead
that
s
the
last
i
know
it
is
that
s
the
last
over
it
pointed
with
a
claw
that
trembled
oh
come
cried
jane
holding
up
the
amulet
i
will
see
the
end
of
the
dream
cried
the
learned
gentleman
you
ll
never
see
anything
else
if
you
do
said
cyril
oh
jimmy
appealed
anthea
i
ll
never
bring
you
out
again
you
ll
never
have
the
chance
if
you
don
t
go
soon
said
the
psammead
i
will
see
the
end
of
the
dream
said
the
learned
gentleman
obstinately
the
hills
around
were
black
with
people
fleeing
from
the
villages
to
the
mountains
and
even
as
they
fled
thin
smoke
broke
from
the
great
white
peak
and
then
a
faint
flash
of
flame
then
the
volcano
began
to
throw
up
its
mysterious
fiery
inside
parts
the
earth
trembled
ashes
and
sulphur
showered
down
a
rain
of
fine
fell
like
snow
on
all
the
dry
land
the
elephants
from
the
forest
rushed
up
towards
the
peaks
great
lizards
thirty
yards
long
broke
from
the
mountain
pools
and
rushed
down
towards
the
sea
the
snows
melted
and
rushed
down
first
in
avalanches
then
in
roaring
torrents
great
rocks
cast
up
by
the
volcano
fell
splashing
in
the
sea
miles
away
oh
this
is
horrible
cried
anthea
come
home
come
home
the
end
of
the
dream
gasped
the
learned
gentleman
hold
up
the
amulet
cried
the
psammead
suddenly
the
place
where
they
stood
was
now
crowded
with
men
and
women
and
the
children
were
strained
tight
against
the
parapet
the
turret
rocked
and
swayed
the
wave
had
reached
the
golden
wall
jane
held
up
the
amulet
now
cried
the
psammead
say
the
word
and
as
jane
said
it
the
psammead
leaped
from
its
bag
and
bit
the
hand
of
the
learned
gentleman
at
the
same
moment
the
boys
pushed
him
through
the
arch
and
all
followed
him
he
turned
to
look
back
and
through
the
arch
he
saw
nothing
but
a
waste
of
waters
with
above
it
the
peak
of
the
terrible
mountain
with
fire
raging
from
it
he
staggered
back
to
his
chair
what
a
ghastly
dream
he
gasped
oh
you
re
here
my
er
dears
can
i
do
anything
for
you
you
ve
hurt
your
hand
said
anthea
gently
let
me
bind
it
the
hand
was
indeed
bleeding
rather
badly
the
psammead
had
crept
back
to
its
bag
all
the
children
were
very
white
never
again
said
the
psammead
later
on
will
i
go
into
the
past
with
a
person
i
will
say
for
you
four
you
do
do
as
you
re
we
didn
t
even
find
the
amulet
said
anthea
later
still
of
course
you
didn
t
it
wasn
t
there
only
the
stone
it
was
made
of
was
there
it
fell
on
to
a
ship
miles
away
that
managed
to
escape
and
got
to
egypt
could
have
told
you
i
wish
you
had
said
anthea
and
her
voice
was
still
rather
shaky
why
didn
t
you
you
never
asked
me
said
the
psammead
very
sulkily
i
m
not
the
sort
of
chap
to
go
shoving
my
oar
in
where
it
s
not
mr
s
friend
will
have
something
worth
having
to
put
in
his
article
now
said
cyril
very
much
later
indeed
not
he
said
robert
sleepily
the
learned
will
think
it
s
a
dream
and
it
s
ten
to
one
he
never
tells
the
other
chap
a
word
about
it
at
robert
was
quite
right
on
both
points
the
learned
gentleman
did
and
he
never
did
chapter
the
little
black
girl
and
julius
caesar
a
great
city
swept
away
by
the
sea
a
beautiful
country
devastated
by
an
active
volcano
these
are
not
the
sort
of
things
you
see
every
day
of
the
week
and
when
you
do
see
them
no
matter
how
many
other
wonders
you
may
have
seen
in
your
time
such
sights
are
rather
apt
to
take
your
breath
away
atlantis
had
certainly
this
effect
on
the
breaths
of
cyril
robert
anthea
and
jane
they
remained
in
a
breathless
state
for
some
days
the
learned
gentleman
seemed
as
breathless
as
anyone
he
spent
a
good
deal
of
what
little
breath
he
had
in
telling
anthea
about
a
wonderful
dream
he
had
you
would
hardly
believe
he
said
that
anyone
could
have
such
a
detailed
but
anthea
could
believe
it
she
said
quite
easily
he
had
ceased
to
talk
about
he
had
now
seen
too
many
wonders
to
believe
that
in
consequence
of
their
breathless
condition
none
of
the
children
suggested
any
new
excursions
through
the
amulet
robert
voiced
the
mood
of
the
others
when
he
said
that
they
were
fed
up
with
amulet
for
a
bit
they
undoubtedly
were
as
for
the
psammead
it
went
to
sand
and
stayed
there
worn
out
by
the
terror
of
the
flood
and
the
violent
exercise
it
had
had
to
take
in
obedience
to
the
inconsiderate
wishes
of
the
learned
gentleman
and
the
babylonian
queen
the
children
let
it
sleep
the
danger
of
taking
it
about
among
strange
people
who
might
at
any
moment
utter
undesirable
wishes
was
becoming
more
and
more
plain
and
there
are
pleasant
things
to
be
done
in
london
without
any
aid
from
amulets
or
psammeads
you
can
for
instance
visit
the
tower
of
london
the
houses
of
parliament
the
national
gallery
the
zoological
gardens
the
various
parks
the
museums
at
south
kensington
madame
tussaud
s
exhibition
of
waxworks
or
the
botanical
gardens
at
kew
you
can
go
to
kew
by
river
steamer
and
this
is
the
way
that
the
children
would
have
gone
if
they
had
gone
at
all
only
they
never
did
because
it
was
when
they
were
discussing
the
arrangements
for
the
journey
and
what
they
should
take
with
them
to
eat
and
how
much
of
it
and
what
the
whole
thing
would
cost
that
the
adventure
of
the
little
black
girl
began
to
happen
the
children
were
sitting
on
a
seat
in
st
james
s
park
they
had
been
watching
the
pelican
repulsing
with
careful
dignity
the
advances
of
the
seagulls
who
are
always
so
anxious
to
play
games
with
it
the
pelican
thinks
very
properly
that
it
hasn
t
the
figure
for
games
so
it
spends
most
of
its
time
pretending
that
that
is
not
the
reason
why
it
won
t
play
the
breathlessness
caused
by
atlantis
was
wearing
off
a
little
cyril
who
always
wanted
to
understand
all
about
everything
was
turning
things
over
in
his
mind
i
m
not
i
m
only
thinking
he
answered
when
robert
asked
him
what
he
was
so
grumpy
about
i
ll
tell
you
when
i
ve
thought
it
all
if
it
s
about
the
amulet
i
don
t
want
to
hear
it
said
jane
nobody
asked
you
to
retorted
cyril
mildly
and
i
haven
t
finished
my
inside
thinking
about
it
yet
let
s
go
to
kew
in
the
i
d
rather
go
in
a
steamer
said
robert
and
the
girls
laughed
that
s
right
said
cyril
be
funny
i
well
he
was
rather
said
anthea
i
wouldn
t
think
squirrel
if
it
hurts
you
so
said
robert
kindly
oh
shut
up
said
cyril
or
else
talk
about
i
want
to
see
the
palms
there
said
anthea
hastily
to
see
if
they
re
anything
like
the
ones
on
the
island
where
we
united
the
cook
and
the
burglar
by
the
reverend
all
disagreeableness
was
swept
away
in
a
pleasant
tide
of
recollections
and
do
you
remember
they
said
have
you
forgotten
my
hat
remarked
cyril
pensively
as
the
flood
of
reminiscence
ebbed
a
little
we
have
had
some
we
have
that
said
robert
don
t
let
s
have
any
more
said
jane
anxiously
that
s
what
i
was
thinking
about
cyril
replied
and
just
then
they
heard
the
little
black
girl
sniff
she
was
quite
close
to
them
she
was
not
really
a
little
black
girl
she
was
shabby
and
not
very
clean
and
she
had
been
crying
so
much
that
you
could
hardly
see
through
the
narrow
chink
between
her
swollen
lids
how
very
blue
her
eyes
were
it
was
her
dress
that
was
black
and
it
was
too
big
and
too
long
for
her
and
she
wore
a
speckled
sailor
hat
that
would
have
fitted
a
much
bigger
head
than
her
little
flaxen
one
and
she
stood
looking
at
the
children
and
sniffing
oh
dear
said
anthea
jumping
up
whatever
is
the
matter
she
put
her
hand
on
the
little
girl
s
arm
it
was
rudely
shaken
off
you
leave
me
be
said
the
little
girl
i
ain
t
doing
nothing
to
but
what
is
it
anthea
asked
has
someone
been
hurting
you
what
s
that
to
you
said
the
little
girl
fiercely
you
re
all
come
away
said
robert
pulling
at
anthea
s
sleeve
she
s
a
nasty
rude
little
oh
no
said
anthea
she
s
only
dreadfully
unhappy
what
is
it
she
asked
again
oh
you
re
all
right
the
child
repeated
you
ain
t
agoin
to
the
can

take
you
home
said
anthea
and
jane
added
where
does
your
mother
live
she
don
t
live
nowheres
she
s
dead
so
now
said
the
little
girl
fiercely
in
tones
of
miserable
triumph
then
she
opened
her
swollen
eyes
widely
stamped
her
foot
in
fury
and
ran
away
she
ran
no
further
than
to
the
next
bench
flung
herself
down
there
and
began
to
cry
without
even
trying
not
to
anthea
quite
at
once
went
to
the
little
girl
and
put
her
arms
as
tight
as
she
could
round
the
black
figure
oh
don
t
cry
so
dear
don
t
don
t
she
whispered
under
the
brim
of
the
large
sailor
hat
now
very
crooked
indeed
tell
anthea
all
about
it
anthea
ll
help
you
there
there
dear
don
t
the
others
stood
at
a
distance
one
or
two
stared
curiously
the
child
was
now
only
crying
part
of
the
time
the
rest
of
the
time
she
seemed
to
be
talking
to
anthea
presently
anthea
beckoned
cyril
it
s
horrible
she
said
in
a
furious
whisper
her
father
was
a
carpenter
and
he
was
a
steady
man
and
never
touched
a
drop
except
on
a
saturday
and
he
came
up
to
london
for
work
and
there
wasn
t
any
and
then
he
died
and
her
name
is
imogen
and
she
s
nine
come
next
november
and
now
her
mother
s
dead
and
she
s
to
stay
tonight
with
mrs
shrobsall
that
s
a
landlady
that
s
been
kind
and
tomorrow
the
relieving
officer
is
coming
for
her
and
she
s
going
into
the
union
that
means
the
workhouse
it
s
too
terrible
what
can
we
do
let
s
ask
the
learned
gentleman
said
jane
brightly
and
as
no
one
else
could
think
of
anything
better
the
whole
party
walked
back
to
fitzroy
street
as
fast
as
it
could
the
little
girl
holding
tight
to
anthea
s
hand
and
now
not
crying
any
more
only
sniffing
gently
the
learned
gentleman
looked
up
from
his
writing
with
the
smile
that
had
grown
much
easier
to
him
than
it
used
to
be
they
were
quite
at
home
in
his
room
now
it
really
seemed
to
welcome
them
even
the
appeared
to
smile
as
if
in
its
distant
superior
ancient
egyptian
way
it
were
rather
pleased
to
see
them
than
not
anthea
sat
on
the
stairs
with
imogen
who
was
nine
come
next
november
while
the
others
went
in
and
explained
the
difficulty
the
learned
gentleman
listened
with
grave
attention
it
really
does
seem
rather
rough
luck
cyril
concluded
because
i
ve
often
heard
about
rich
people
who
wanted
children
most
awfully
though
i
know
never
should
but
they
do
there
must
be
somebody
who
d
be
glad
to
have
gipsies
are
awfully
fond
of
children
robert
hopefully
said
they
re
always
stealing
them
perhaps
they
d
have
she
s
quite
a
nice
little
girl
really
jane
added
she
was
only
rude
at
first
because
we
looked
jolly
and
happy
and
she
wasn
t
you
understand
that
don
t
you
yes
said
he
absently
fingering
a
little
blue
image
from
egypt
i
understand
that
very
well
as
you
say
there
must
be
some
home
where
she
would
be
he
scowled
thoughtfully
at
the
little
blue
image
anthea
outside
thought
the
explanation
was
taking
a
very
long
time
she
was
so
busy
trying
to
cheer
and
comfort
the
little
black
girl
that
she
never
noticed
the
psammead
who
roused
from
sleep
by
her
voice
had
shaken
itself
free
of
sand
and
was
coming
crookedly
up
the
stairs
it
was
close
to
her
before
she
saw
it
she
picked
it
up
and
settled
it
in
her
lap
what
is
it
asked
the
black
child
is
it
a
cat
or
a
or
what
and
then
anthea
heard
the
learned
gentleman
say
yes
i
wish
we
could
find
a
home
where
they
would
be
glad
to
have
her
and
instantly
she
felt
the
psammead
begin
to
blow
itself
out
as
it
sat
on
her
lap
she
jumped
up
lifting
the
psammead
in
her
skirt
and
holding
imogen
by
the
hand
rushed
into
the
learned
gentleman
s
room
at
least
let
s
keep
together
she
cried
all
hold
hands
quick
the
circle
was
like
that
formed
for
the
mulberry
bush
or
and
anthea
was
only
able
to
take
part
in
it
by
holding
in
her
teeth
the
hem
of
her
frock
which
thus
supported
formed
a
bag
to
hold
the
psammead
is
it
a
game
asked
the
learned
gentleman
feebly
no
one
answered
there
was
a
moment
of
suspense
then
came
that
curious
sensation
which
one
almost
always
feels
when
transported
from
one
place
to
another
by
magic
also
there
was
that
dizzy
dimness
of
sight
which
comes
on
these
occasions
the
mist
cleared
the
sensation
subsided
and
there
stood
the
six
in
a
ring
as
before
only
their
twelve
feet
instead
of
standing
on
the
carpet
of
the
learned
gentleman
s
room
stood
on
green
grass
above
them
instead
of
the
dusky
ceiling
of
the
fitzroy
street
floor
was
a
pale
blue
sky
and
where
the
walls
had
been
and
the
painted
were
tall
dark
green
trees
oaks
and
ashes
and
in
between
the
trees
and
under
them
tangled
bushes
and
creeping
ivy
there
were
too
but
there
was
nothing
under
them
but
their
own
dead
red
drifted
leaves
and
here
and
there
a
delicate
green
and
there
they
stood
in
a
circle
still
holding
hands
as
though
they
were
playing
or
the
mulberry
bush
just
six
people
hand
in
hand
in
a
wood
that
sounds
simple
but
then
you
must
remember
that
they
did
not
know
where
the
wood
was
and
what
s
more
they
didn
t
know
when
then
wood
was
there
was
a
curious
sort
of
feeling
that
made
the
learned
gentleman
say
another
dream
dear
me
and
made
the
children
almost
certain
that
they
were
in
a
time
a
very
long
while
ago
as
for
little
imogen
she
said
oh
my
and
kept
her
mouth
very
much
open
indeed
where
are
we
cyril
asked
the
psammead
in
britain
said
the
psammead
but
when
asked
anthea
anxiously
about
the
year
before
the
year
you
reckon
time
from
said
the
psammead
crossly
is
there
anything
else
you
want
to
know
it
added
sticking
its
head
out
of
the
bag
formed
by
anthea
s
blue
linen
frock
and
turning
its
snail
s
eyes
to
right
and
left
i
ve
been
here
before
it
s
very
little
yes
but
why
here
asked
anthea
your
inconsiderate
friend
the
psammead
replied
wished
to
find
some
home
where
they
would
be
glad
to
have
that
unattractive
and
immature
female
human
being
whom
you
have
picked
up
gracious
knows
how
in
megatherium
days
properly
children
didn
t
talk
to
shabby
strangers
in
parks
your
thoughtless
friend
wanted
a
place
where
someone
would
be
glad
to
have
this
undesirable
stranger
and
now
here
you
are
i
see
we
are
said
anthea
patiently
looking
round
on
the
tall
gloom
of
the
forest
but
why
here
why
now
you
don
t
suppose
anyone
would
want
a
child
like
that
in
your
times
in
your
towns
said
the
psammead
in
irritated
tones
you
ve
got
your
country
into
such
a
mess
that
there
s
no
room
for
half
your
children
and
no
one
to
want
that
s
not
our
doing
you
know
said
anthea
gently
and
bringing
me
here
without
any
waterproof
or
anything
said
the
psammead
still
more
crossly
when
everyone
knows
how
damp
and
foggy
ancient
britain
here
take
my
coat
said
robert
taking
it
off
anthea
spread
the
coat
on
the
ground
and
putting
the
psammead
on
it
folded
it
round
so
that
only
the
eyes
and
furry
ears
showed
there
she
said
comfortingly
now
if
it
does
begin
to
look
like
rain
i
can
cover
you
up
in
a
minute
now
what
are
we
to
do
the
others
who
had
stopped
holding
hands
crowded
round
to
hear
the
answer
to
this
question
imogen
whispered
in
an
awed
tone
can
t
the
organ
monkey
talk
neither
i
thought
it
was
only
parrots
do
replied
the
psammead
i
don
t
care
what
you
do
and
it
drew
head
and
ears
into
the
tweed
covering
of
robert
s
coat
the
others
looked
at
each
other
it
s
only
a
dream
said
the
learned
gentleman
hopefully
something
is
sure
to
happen
if
we
can
prevent
ourselves
from
waking
and
sure
enough
something
did
the
brooding
silence
of
the
dark
forest
was
broken
by
the
laughter
of
children
and
the
sound
of
voices
let
s
go
and
see
said
cyril
it
s
only
a
dream
said
the
learned
gentleman
to
jane
who
hung
back
if
you
don
t
go
with
the
tide
of
a
dream
if
you
resist
you
wake
up
you
there
was
a
sort
of
break
in
the
undergrowth
that
was
like
a
silly
person
s
idea
of
a
path
they
went
along
this
in
indian
file
the
learned
gentleman
leading
quite
soon
they
came
to
a
large
clearing
in
the
forest
there
were
a
number
of
houses
huts
perhaps
you
would
have
called
them
with
a
sort
of
mud
and
wood
fence
it
s
like
the
old
egyptian
town
whispered
anthea
and
it
was
rather
some
children
with
no
clothes
on
at
all
were
playing
what
looked
like
or
mulberry
bush
that
is
to
say
they
were
dancing
round
in
a
ring
holding
hands
on
a
grassy
bank
several
women
dressed
in
blue
and
white
robes
and
tunics
of
sat
watching
the
playing
children
the
children
from
fitzroy
street
stood
on
the
fringe
of
the
forest
looking
at
the
games
one
woman
with
long
fair
braided
hair
sat
a
little
apart
from
the
others
and
there
was
a
look
in
her
eyes
as
she
followed
the
play
of
the
children
that
made
anthea
feel
sad
and
sorry
none
of
those
little
girls
is
her
own
little
girl
thought
anthea
the
little
london
child
pulled
at
anthea
s
sleeve
look
she
said
that
one
there
she
s
precious
like
mother
mother
s
air
was
somethink
lovely
when
she
ad
time
to
comb
it
out
mother
wouldn
t
never
me
if
she
d
lived
ere
i
don
t
suppose
there
s
e
er
a
public
nearer
than
epping
do
you
miss
in
her
eagerness
the
child
had
stepped
out
of
the
shelter
of
the
forest
the
woman
saw
her
she
stood
up
her
thin
face
lighted
up
with
a
radiance
like
sunrise
her
long
lean
arms
stretched
towards
the
london
child
imogen
she
cried
at
least
the
word
was
more
like
that
than
any
other
word
imogen
there
was
a
moment
of
great
silence
the
naked
children
paused
in
their
play
the
women
on
the
bank
stared
anxiously
oh
it
is
mother
it
is
cried
and
rushed
across
the
cleared
space
she
and
her
mother
clung
together
so
closely
so
strongly
that
they
stood
an
instant
like
a
statue
carved
in
stone
then
the
women
crowded
round
it
is
my
imogen
cried
the
woman
oh
it
is
and
she
wasn
t
eaten
by
wolves
she
s
come
back
to
me
tell
me
my
darling
how
did
you
escape
where
have
you
been
who
has
fed
and
clothed
you
i
don
t
know
nothink
said
imogen
poor
child
whispered
the
women
who
crowded
round
the
terror
of
the
wolves
has
turned
her
but
you
know
me
said
the
woman
and
imogen
clinging
with
arms
to
the
bare
neck
answered
oh
yes
mother
i
know
you
right
what
is
it
what
do
they
say
the
learned
gentleman
asked
anxiously
you
wished
to
come
where
someone
wanted
the
child
said
the
psammead
the
child
says
this
is
her
and
the
mother
you
can
see
said
the
psammead
but
is
she
really
her
child
i
mean
who
knows
said
the
psammead
but
each
one
fills
the
empty
place
in
the
other
s
heart
it
is
oh
said
the
learned
gentleman
this
is
a
good
dream
i
wish
the
child
might
stay
in
the
the
psammead
blew
itself
out
and
granted
the
wish
so
imogen
s
future
was
assured
she
had
found
someone
to
want
her
if
only
all
the
children
that
no
one
wants
began
the
learned
gentleman
but
the
woman
interrupted
she
came
towards
them
welcome
all
she
cried
i
am
the
queen
and
my
child
tells
me
that
you
have
befriended
her
and
this
i
well
believe
looking
on
your
faces
your
garb
is
strange
but
faces
i
can
read
the
child
is
bewitched
i
see
that
well
but
in
this
she
speaks
truth
is
it
not
so
the
children
said
it
wasn
t
worth
mentioning
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
all
the
honours
and
kindnesses
lavished
on
the
children
and
the
learned
gentleman
by
those
ancient
britons
you
would
have
thought
to
see
them
that
a
child
was
something
to
make
a
fuss
about
not
a
bit
of
rubbish
to
be
hustled
about
the
streets
and
hidden
away
in
the
workhouse
it
wasn
t
as
grand
as
the
entertainment
at
babylon
but
somehow
it
was
more
satisfying
i
think
you
children
have
some
wonderful
influence
on
me
said
the
learned
gentleman
i
never
dreamed
such
dreams
before
i
knew
it
was
when
they
were
alone
that
night
under
the
stars
where
the
britons
had
spread
a
heap
of
dried
fern
for
them
to
sleep
on
that
cyril
spoke
well
he
said
we
ve
made
it
all
right
for
imogen
and
had
a
jolly
good
time
i
vote
we
get
home
again
before
the
fighting
what
fighting
asked
jane
sleepily
why
julius
caesar
you
little
goat
replied
her
kind
brother
don
t
you
see
that
if
this
is
the
year
julius
caesar
may
happen
at
any
i
thought
you
liked
caesar
said
robert
so
i
do
in
the
history
but
that
s
different
from
being
killed
by
his
if
we
saw
caesar
we
might
persuade
him
not
to
said
anthea
you
persuade
caesar
robert
laughed
the
learned
gentleman
before
anyone
could
stop
him
said
i
only
wish
we
could
see
caesar
some
and
of
course
in
just
the
little
time
the
psammead
took
to
blow
itself
out
for
the
five
or
six
counting
the
psammead
found
themselves
in
caesar
s
camp
just
outside
caesar
s
tent
and
they
saw
caesar
the
psammead
must
have
taken
advantage
of
the
loose
wording
of
the
learned
gentleman
s
wish
for
it
was
not
the
same
time
of
day
as
that
on
which
the
wish
had
been
uttered
among
the
dried
ferns
it
was
sunset
and
the
great
man
sat
on
a
chair
outside
his
tent
gazing
over
the
sea
towards
britain
everyone
knew
without
being
told
that
it
was
towards
britain
two
golden
eagles
on
the
top
of
posts
stood
on
each
side
of
the
tent
and
on
the
flaps
of
the
tent
which
was
very
gorgeous
to
look
at
were
the
letters
the
great
man
turned
unchanged
on
the
newcomers
the
august
glance
that
he
had
turned
on
the
violet
waters
of
the
channel
though
they
had
suddenly
appeared
out
of
nothing
caesar
never
showed
by
the
faintest
movement
of
an
eyelid
by
the
least
tightening
of
that
firm
mouth
that
they
were
not
some
long
expected
embassy
he
waved
a
calm
hand
towards
the
sentinels
who
sprang
weapons
in
hand
towards
the
newcomers
back
he
said
in
a
voice
that
thrilled
like
music
since
when
has
caesar
feared
children
and
students
to
the
children
he
seemed
to
speak
in
the
only
language
they
knew
but
the
learned
gentleman
heard
in
rather
a
strange
accent
but
quite
intelligibly
the
lips
of
caesar
speaking
in
the
latin
tongue
and
in
that
tongue
a
little
stiffly
he
answered
it
is
a
dream
o
a
dream
repeated
caesar
what
is
a
dream
this
said
the
learned
gentleman
not
it
said
cyril
it
s
a
sort
of
magic
we
come
out
of
another
time
and
another
and
we
want
to
ask
you
not
to
trouble
about
conquering
britain
said
anthea
it
s
a
poor
little
place
not
worth
bothering
are
you
from
britain
the
general
asked
your
clothes
are
uncouth
but
well
woven
and
your
hair
is
short
as
the
hair
of
roman
citizens
not
long
like
the
hair
of
barbarians
yet
such
i
deem
you
to
we
re
not
said
jane
with
angry
eagerness
we
re
not
barbarians
at
all
we
come
from
the
country
where
the
sun
never
sets
and
we
ve
read
about
you
in
books
and
our
country
s
full
of
fine
things
st
paul
s
and
the
tower
of
london
and
madame
tussaud
s
exhibition
and
then
the
others
stopped
her
don
t
talk
nonsense
said
robert
in
a
bitter
undertone
caesar
looked
at
the
children
a
moment
in
silence
then
he
called
a
soldier
and
spoke
with
him
apart
then
he
said
aloud
you
three
elder
children
may
go
where
you
will
within
the
camp
few
children
are
privileged
to
see
the
camp
of
caesar
the
student
and
the
smaller
will
remain
here
with
nobody
liked
this
but
when
caesar
said
a
thing
that
thing
was
so
and
there
was
an
end
to
it
so
the
three
went
left
alone
with
jane
and
the
learned
gentleman
the
great
roman
found
it
easy
enough
to
turn
them
inside
out
but
it
was
not
easy
even
for
him
to
make
head
or
tail
of
the
insides
of
their
minds
when
he
had
got
at
them
the
learned
gentleman
insisted
that
the
whole
thing
was
a
dream
and
refused
to
talk
much
on
the
ground
that
if
he
did
he
would
wake
up
jane
closely
questioned
was
full
of
information
about
railways
electric
lights
balloons
cannons
and
dynamite
and
do
they
fight
with
swords
asked
the
general
yes
swords
and
guns
and
caesar
wanted
to
know
what
guns
were
you
fire
them
said
jane
and
they
go
bang
and
people
fall
down
but
what
are
guns
like
jane
found
them
hard
to
describe
but
robert
has
a
toy
one
in
his
pocket
she
said
so
the
others
were
recalled
the
boys
explained
the
pistol
to
caesar
very
fully
and
he
looked
at
it
with
the
greatest
interest
it
was
a
pistol
the
one
that
had
done
such
good
service
in
the
old
egyptian
village
i
shall
cause
guns
to
be
made
said
caesar
and
you
will
be
detained
till
i
know
whether
you
have
spoken
the
truth
i
had
just
decided
that
britain
was
not
worth
the
bother
of
invading
but
what
you
tell
me
decides
me
that
it
is
very
much
worth
but
it
s
all
nonsense
said
anthea
britain
is
just
a
savage
sort
of
island
all
fogs
and
trees
and
big
rivers
but
the
people
are
kind
we
know
a
little
girl
there
named
imogen
and
it
s
no
use
your
making
guns
because
you
can
t
fire
them
without
gunpowder
and
that
won
t
be
invented
for
hundreds
of
years
and
we
don
t
know
how
to
make
it
and
we
can
t
tell
you
do
go
straight
home
dear
caesar
and
let
poor
little
britain
but
this
other
says
said
caesar
all
jane
s
been
telling
you
is
what
it
s
going
to
be
anthea
interrupted
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
years
from
the
little
one
is
a
prophetess
eh
said
caesar
with
a
whimsical
look
rather
young
for
the
business
isn
t
she
you
can
call
her
a
prophetess
if
you
like
said
cyril
but
what
anthea
says
is
anthea
said
caesar
that
s
a
greek
very
likely
said
cyril
worriedly
i
say
i
do
wish
you
d
give
up
this
idea
of
conquering
britain
it
s
not
worth
while
really
it
isn
t
on
the
contrary
said
caesar
what
you
ve
told
me
has
decided
me
to
go
if
it
s
only
to
find
out
what
britain
is
really
like
guards
detain
these
quick
said
robert
before
the
guards
begin
detaining
we
had
enough
of
that
in
jane
held
up
the
amulet
away
from
the
sunset
and
said
the
word
the
learned
gentleman
was
pushed
through
and
the
others
more
quickly
than
ever
before
passed
through
the
arch
back
into
their
own
times
and
the
quiet
dusty
of
the
learned
gentleman
it
is
a
curious
fact
that
when
caesar
was
encamped
on
the
coast
of
gaul
somewhere
near
boulogne
it
was
i
believe
he
was
sitting
before
his
tent
in
the
glow
of
the
sunset
looking
out
over
the
violet
waters
of
the
english
channel
suddenly
he
started
rubbed
his
eyes
and
called
his
secretary
the
young
man
came
quickly
from
within
the
tent
marcus
said
caesar
i
have
dreamed
a
very
wonderful
dream
some
of
it
i
forget
but
i
remember
enough
to
decide
what
was
not
before
determined
tomorrow
the
ships
that
have
been
brought
round
from
the
ligeris
shall
be
provisioned
we
shall
sail
for
this
island
first
we
will
take
but
two
legions
this
if
what
we
have
heard
be
true
should
suffice
but
if
my
dream
be
true
then
a
hundred
legions
will
not
suffice
for
the
dream
i
dreamed
was
the
most
wonderful
that
ever
tormented
the
brain
even
of
caesar
and
caesar
has
dreamed
some
strange
things
in
his
and
if
you
hadn
t
told
caesar
all
that
about
how
things
are
now
he
d
never
have
invaded
britain
said
robert
to
jane
as
they
sat
down
to
tea
oh
nonsense
said
anthea
pouring
out
it
was
all
settled
hundreds
of
years
i
don
t
know
said
cyril
jam
please
this
about
time
being
only
a
thingummy
of
thought
is
very
confusing
if
everything
happens
at
the
same
time
it
can
t
said
anthea
stoutly
the
present
s
the
present
and
the
past
s
the
not
always
said
cyril
when
we
were
in
the
past
the
present
was
the
future
now
then
he
added
triumphantly
and
anthea
could
not
deny
it
i
should
have
liked
to
see
more
of
the
camp
said
robert
yes
we
didn
t
get
much
for
our
money
but
imogen
is
happy
that
s
one
thing
said
anthea
we
left
her
happy
in
the
past
i
ve
often
seen
about
people
being
happy
in
the
past
in
poetry
books
i
see
what
it
means
it
s
not
a
bad
idea
said
the
psammead
sleepily
putting
its
head
out
of
its
bag
and
taking
it
in
again
suddenly
being
left
in
the
everyone
remembered
this
afterwards
when
chapter
before
pharaoh
it
was
the
day
after
the
adventure
of
julius
caesar
and
the
little
black
girl
that
cyril
bursting
into
the
bathroom
to
wash
his
hands
for
dinner
you
have
no
idea
how
dirty
they
were
for
he
had
been
playing
shipwrecked
mariners
all
the
morning
on
the
leads
at
the
back
of
the
house
where
the
is
found
anthea
leaning
her
elbows
on
the
edge
of
the
bath
and
crying
steadily
into
it
hullo
he
said
with
brotherly
concern
what
s
up
now
dinner
ll
be
cold
before
you
ve
got
enough
for
a
go
away
said
anthea
fiercely
i
hate
you
i
hate
everybody
there
was
a
stricken
pause
didn
t
know
said
cyril
tamely
nobody
ever
does
know
anything
sobbed
anthea
i
didn
t
know
you
were
waxy
i
thought
you
d
just
hurt
your
fingers
with
the
tap
again
like
you
did
last
week
cyril
carefully
explained
oh
fingers
sneered
anthea
through
her
sniffs
here
drop
it
panther
he
said
uncomfortably
you
haven
t
been
having
a
row
or
anything
no
she
said
wash
your
horrid
hands
for
goodness
sake
if
that
s
what
you
came
for
or
anthea
was
so
seldom
cross
that
when
she
was
cross
the
others
were
always
more
surprised
than
angry
cyril
edged
along
the
side
of
the
bath
and
stood
beside
her
he
put
his
hand
on
her
arm
dry
up
do
he
said
rather
tenderly
for
him
and
finding
that
though
she
did
not
at
once
take
his
advice
she
did
not
seem
to
resent
it
he
put
his
arm
awkwardly
across
her
shoulders
and
rubbed
his
head
against
her
ear
there
he
said
in
the
tone
of
one
administering
a
priceless
cure
for
all
possible
sorrows
now
what
s
up
promise
you
won
t
laugh
i
don
t
feel
laughish
myself
said
cyril
dismally
well
then
said
anthea
leaning
her
ear
against
his
head
it
s
what
s
the
matter
with
mother
asked
cyril
with
apparent
want
of
sympathy
she
was
all
right
in
her
letter
this
yes
but
i
want
her
you
re
not
the
only
one
said
cyril
briefly
and
the
brevity
of
his
tone
admitted
a
good
deal
oh
yes
said
anthea
i
know
we
all
want
her
all
the
time
but
i
want
her
now
most
dreadfully
awfully
much
i
never
wanted
anything
so
much
that
imogen
child
the
way
the
ancient
british
queen
cuddled
her
up
and
imogen
wasn
t
me
and
the
queen
was
mother
and
then
her
letter
this
morning
and
about
the
lamb
liking
the
salt
bathing
and
she
bathed
him
in
this
very
bath
the
night
before
she
went
away
oh
oh
oh
cyril
thumped
her
on
the
back
cheer
up
he
said
you
know
my
inside
thinking
that
i
was
doing
well
that
was
partly
about
mother
we
ll
soon
get
her
back
if
you
ll
chuck
it
like
a
sensible
kid
and
wash
your
face
i
ll
tell
you
about
it
that
s
right
you
let
me
get
to
the
tap
can
t
you
stop
crying
shall
i
put
the
down
your
back
that
s
for
noses
said
anthea
and
i
m
not
a
kid
any
more
than
you
are
but
she
laughed
a
little
and
her
mouth
began
to
get
back
into
its
proper
shape
you
know
what
an
odd
shape
your
mouth
gets
into
when
you
cry
in
earnest
look
here
said
cyril
working
the
soap
round
and
round
between
his
hands
in
a
thick
slime
of
grey
soapsuds
i
ve
been
thinking
we
ve
only
just
played
with
the
amulet
so
far
we
ve
got
to
work
it
now
work
it
for
all
it
s
worth
and
it
isn
t
only
mother
either
there
s
father
out
there
all
among
the
fighting
i
don
t
howl
about
it
but
i
think
oh
bother
the
soap
the
soap
had
squirted
out
under
the
pressure
of
his
fingers
and
had
hit
anthea
s
chin
with
as
much
force
as
though
it
had
been
shot
from
a
catapult
there
now
she
said
regretfully
now
i
shall
have
to
wash
my
you
d
have
had
to
do
that
anyway
said
cyril
with
conviction
now
my
idea
s
this
you
know
missionaries
yes
said
anthea
who
did
not
know
a
single
one
well
they
always
take
the
savages
beads
and
brandy
and
stays
and
hats
and
braces
and
really
useful
things
things
the
savages
haven
t
got
and
never
heard
about
and
the
savages
love
them
for
their
kind
generousness
and
give
them
pearls
and
shells
and
ivory
and
cassowaries
and
that
s
the
way
wait
a
sec
said
anthea
splashing
i
can
t
hear
what
you
re
saying
shells
and
shells
and
things
like
that
the
great
thing
is
to
get
people
to
love
you
by
being
generous
and
that
s
what
we
ve
got
to
do
next
time
we
go
into
the
past
we
ll
regularly
fit
out
the
expedition
you
remember
how
the
babylonian
queen
froze
on
to
that
well
we
ll
take
things
like
that
and
offer
them
in
exchange
for
a
sight
of
the
a
sight
of
it
is
not
much
no
silly
but
don
t
you
see
when
we
ve
seen
it
we
shall
know
where
it
is
and
we
can
go
and
take
it
in
the
night
when
everybody
is
it
wouldn
t
be
stealing
would
it
said
anthea
thoughtfully
because
it
will
be
such
an
awfully
long
time
ago
when
we
do
it
oh
there
s
that
bell
as
soon
as
dinner
was
eaten
it
was
tinned
salmon
and
lettuce
and
a
jam
tart
and
the
cloth
cleared
away
the
idea
was
explained
to
the
others
and
the
psammead
was
aroused
from
sand
and
asked
what
it
thought
would
be
good
merchandise
with
which
to
buy
the
affection
of
say
the
ancient
egyptians
and
whether
it
thought
the
amulet
was
likely
to
be
found
in
the
court
of
pharaoh
but
it
shook
its
head
and
shot
out
its
snail
s
eyes
hopelessly
i
m
not
allowed
to
play
in
this
game
it
said
of
course
i
could
find
out
in
a
minute
where
the
thing
was
only
i
mayn
t
but
i
may
go
so
far
as
to
own
that
your
idea
of
taking
things
with
you
isn
t
a
bad
one
and
i
shouldn
t
show
them
all
at
once
take
small
things
and
conceal
them
craftily
about
your
this
advice
seemed
good
soon
the
table
was
littered
over
with
things
which
the
children
thought
likely
to
interest
the
ancient
egyptians
anthea
brought
dolls
puzzle
blocks
a
wooden
a
green
leather
case
with
necessaire
written
on
it
in
gold
letters
aunt
emma
had
once
given
it
to
anthea
and
it
had
then
contained
scissors
penknife
bodkin
stiletto
thimble
corkscrew
and
the
scissors
knife
and
thimble
and
penknife
were
of
course
lost
but
the
other
things
were
there
and
as
good
as
new
cyril
contributed
lead
soldiers
a
cannon
a
catapult
a
a
and
a
tennis
ball
and
a
padlock
no
key
robert
collected
a
candle
i
don
t
suppose
they
ever
saw
a
paraffin
one
he
said
a
penny
japanese
a
rubber
stamp
with
his
father
s
name
and
address
on
it
and
a
piece
of
putty
jane
added
a
the
brass
handle
of
a
poker
a
pot
that
had
held
a
smoked
pearl
button
off
her
winter
coat
and
a
key
no
lock
we
can
t
take
all
this
rubbish
said
robert
with
some
scorn
we
must
just
each
choose
one
the
afternoon
passed
very
agreeably
in
the
attempt
to
choose
from
the
table
the
four
most
suitable
objects
but
the
four
children
could
not
agree
what
was
suitable
and
at
last
cyril
said
look
here
let
s
each
be
blindfolded
and
reach
out
and
the
first
thing
you
touch
you
stick
this
was
done
cyril
touched
the
padlock
anthea
got
the
necessaire
robert
clutched
the
candle
jane
picked
up
the
it
s
not
much
she
said
i
don
t
believe
ancient
egyptians
wore
never
mind
said
anthea
i
believe
it
s
luckier
not
to
really
choose
in
the
stories
it
s
always
the
thing
the
s
son
picks
up
in
the
forest
and
almost
throws
away
because
he
thinks
it
s
no
good
that
turns
out
to
be
the
magic
thing
in
the
end
or
else
someone
s
lost
it
and
he
is
rewarded
with
the
hand
of
the
king
s
daughter
in
i
don
t
want
any
hands
in
marriage
thank
said
cyril
firmly
nor
yet
me
said
robert
it
s
always
the
end
of
the
adventures
when
it
comes
to
the
marriage
are
we
ready
said
anthea
it
is
egypt
we
re
going
to
isn
t
it
nice
egypt
said
jane
i
won
t
go
anywhere
i
don
t
know
about
like
that
dreadful
city
she
insisted
then
the
psammead
was
coaxed
into
its
bag
i
say
said
cyril
suddenly
i
m
rather
sick
of
kings
and
people
notice
you
so
in
palaces
besides
the
amulet
s
sure
to
be
in
a
temple
let
s
just
go
among
the
common
people
and
try
to
work
ourselves
up
by
degrees
we
might
get
taken
on
as
temple
like
beadles
said
anthea
or
vergers
they
must
have
splendid
chances
of
stealing
the
temple
righto
was
the
general
rejoinder
the
charm
was
held
up
it
grew
big
once
again
and
once
again
the
warm
golden
eastern
light
glowed
softly
beyond
it
as
the
children
stepped
through
it
loud
and
furious
voices
rang
in
their
ears
they
went
suddenly
from
the
quiet
of
fitzroy
street
into
a
very
angry
eastern
crowd
a
crowd
much
too
angry
to
notice
them
they
edged
through
it
to
the
wall
of
a
house
and
stood
there
the
crowd
was
of
men
women
and
children
they
were
of
all
sorts
of
complexions
and
pictures
of
them
might
have
been
coloured
by
any
child
with
a
shilling
the
colours
that
child
would
have
used
for
complexions
would
have
been
yellow
ochre
red
ochre
light
red
sepia
and
indian
ink
but
their
faces
were
painted
already
black
eyebrows
and
lashes
and
some
red
lips
the
women
wore
a
sort
of
pinafore
with
shoulder
straps
and
loose
things
wound
round
their
heads
and
shoulders
the
men
wore
very
little
clothing
for
they
were
the
working
people
and
the
egyptian
boys
and
girls
wore
nothing
at
all
unless
you
count
the
little
ornaments
hung
on
chains
round
their
necks
and
waists
the
children
saw
all
this
before
they
could
hear
anything
distinctly
everyone
was
shouting
so
but
a
voice
sounded
above
the
other
voices
and
presently
it
was
speaking
in
a
silence
comrades
and
fellow
workers
it
said
and
it
was
the
voice
of
a
tall
man
who
had
climbed
into
a
chariot
that
had
been
stopped
by
the
crowd
its
owner
had
bolted
muttering
something
about
calling
the
guards
and
now
the
man
spoke
from
it
comrades
and
fellow
workers
how
long
are
we
to
endure
the
tyranny
of
our
masters
who
live
in
idleness
and
luxury
on
the
fruit
of
our
toil
they
only
give
us
a
bare
subsistence
wage
and
they
live
on
the
fat
of
the
land
we
labour
all
our
lives
to
keep
them
in
wanton
luxury
let
us
make
an
end
of
it
a
roar
of
applause
answered
him
how
are
you
going
to
do
it
cried
a
voice
you
look
out
cried
another
or
you
ll
get
yourself
into
i
ve
heard
almost
every
single
word
of
that
whispered
robert
in
hyde
park
last
sunday
let
us
strike
for
more
bread
and
onions
and
beer
and
a
longer
rest
the
speaker
went
on
you
are
tired
you
are
hungry
you
are
thirsty
you
are
poor
your
wives
and
children
are
pining
for
food
the
barns
of
the
rich
are
full
to
bursting
with
the
corn
we
want
the
corn
our
labour
has
grown
to
the
granaries
to
the
granaries
cried
half
the
crowd
but
another
voice
shouted
clear
above
the
tumult
to
pharaoh
to
the
king
let
s
present
a
petition
to
the
king
he
will
listen
to
the
voice
of
the
oppressed
for
a
moment
the
crowd
swayed
one
way
and
another
first
towards
the
granaries
and
then
towards
the
palace
then
with
a
rush
like
that
of
an
imprisoned
torrent
suddenly
set
free
it
surged
along
the
street
towards
the
palace
and
the
children
were
carried
with
it
anthea
found
it
difficult
to
keep
the
psammead
from
being
squeezed
very
uncomfortably
the
crowd
swept
through
the
streets
of
houses
with
few
windows
very
high
up
across
the
market
where
people
were
not
buying
but
exchanging
goods
in
a
momentary
pause
robert
saw
a
basket
of
onions
exchanged
for
a
hair
comb
and
five
fish
for
a
string
of
beads
the
people
in
the
market
seemed
better
off
than
those
in
the
crowd
they
had
finer
clothes
and
more
of
them
they
were
the
kind
of
people
who
nowadays
would
have
lived
at
brixton
or
brockley
what
s
the
trouble
now
a
languid
lady
in
a
crimped
linen
dress
with
her
black
hair
very
much
braided
and
puffed
out
asked
of
a
oh
the
discontented
as
usual
the
man
answered
listen
to
them
anyone
would
think
it
mattered
whether
they
had
a
little
more
or
less
to
eat
dregs
of
society
said
the
scum
said
the
lady
and
i
ve
heard
that
before
too
said
robert
at
that
moment
the
voice
of
the
crowd
changed
from
anger
to
doubt
from
doubt
to
fear
there
were
other
voices
shouting
they
shouted
defiance
and
menace
and
they
came
nearer
very
quickly
there
was
the
rattle
of
wheels
and
the
pounding
of
hoofs
a
voice
shouted
guards
the
guards
the
guards
shouted
another
voice
and
the
crowd
of
workmen
took
up
the
cry
the
guards
pharaoh
s
guards
and
swaying
a
little
once
more
the
crowd
hung
for
a
moment
as
it
were
balanced
then
as
the
trampling
hoofs
came
nearer
the
workmen
fled
dispersed
up
alleys
and
into
the
courts
of
houses
and
the
guards
in
their
embossed
leather
chariots
swept
down
the
street
at
the
gallop
their
wheels
clattering
over
the
stones
and
their
blue
tunics
blown
open
and
back
with
the
wind
of
their
going
so
that
riot
s
over
said
the
lady
that
s
a
blessing
and
did
you
notice
the
captain
of
the
guard
what
a
very
handsome
man
he
was
to
be
sure
the
four
children
had
taken
advantage
of
the
moment
s
pause
before
the
crowd
turned
to
fly
to
edge
themselves
and
drag
each
other
into
an
arched
doorway
now
they
each
drew
a
long
breath
and
looked
at
the
others
we
re
well
out
of
that
said
cyril
yes
said
anthea
but
i
do
wish
the
poor
men
hadn
t
been
driven
back
before
they
could
get
to
the
king
he
might
have
done
something
for
not
if
he
was
the
one
in
the
bible
he
wouldn
t
said
jane
he
had
a
hard
ah
that
was
the
moses
one
anthea
explained
the
joseph
one
was
quite
different
i
should
like
to
see
pharaoh
s
house
i
wonder
whether
it
s
like
the
egyptian
court
in
the
crystal
i
thought
we
decided
to
try
to
get
taken
on
in
a
temple
said
cyril
in
injured
tones
yes
but
we
ve
got
to
know
someone
first
couldn
t
we
make
friends
with
a
temple
doorkeeper
we
might
give
him
the
padlock
or
something
i
wonder
which
are
temples
and
which
are
palaces
robert
added
glancing
across
the
to
where
an
enormous
gateway
with
huge
side
buildings
towered
towards
the
sky
to
right
and
left
of
it
were
other
buildings
only
a
little
less
magnificent
did
you
wish
to
seek
out
the
temple
of
amen
ra
asked
a
soft
voice
behind
them
or
the
temple
of
mut
or
the
temple
of
khonsu
they
turned
to
find
beside
them
a
young
man
he
was
shaved
clean
from
head
to
foot
and
on
his
feet
were
light
papyrus
sandals
he
was
clothed
in
a
linen
tunic
of
white
embroidered
heavily
in
colours
he
was
gay
with
anklets
bracelets
and
armlets
of
gold
richly
inlaid
he
wore
a
ring
on
his
finger
and
he
had
a
short
jacket
of
gold
embroidery
something
like
the
zouave
soldiers
wear
and
on
his
neck
was
a
gold
collar
with
many
amulets
hanging
from
it
but
among
the
amulets
the
children
could
see
none
like
theirs
it
doesn
t
matter
which
temple
said
cyril
frankly
tell
me
your
mission
said
the
young
man
i
am
a
divine
father
of
the
temple
of
amen
ra
and
perhaps
i
can
help
well
said
cyril
we
ve
come
from
the
great
empire
on
which
the
sun
never
i
thought
somehow
that
you
d
come
from
some
odd
spot
said
the
priest
with
courtesy
and
we
ve
seen
a
good
many
palaces
we
thought
we
should
like
to
see
a
temple
for
a
change
said
robert
the
psammead
stirred
uneasily
in
its
embroidered
bag
have
you
brought
gifts
to
the
temple
asked
the
priest
cautiously
we
have
got
some
gifts
said
cyril
with
equal
caution
you
see
there
s
magic
mixed
up
in
it
so
we
can
t
tell
you
everything
but
we
don
t
want
to
give
our
gifts
for
beware
how
you
insult
the
god
said
the
priest
sternly
i
also
can
do
magic
i
can
make
a
waxen
image
of
you
and
i
can
say
words
which
as
the
wax
image
melts
before
the
fire
will
make
you
dwindle
away
and
at
last
perish
pooh
said
cyril
stoutly
that
s
nothing
can
make
fire
itself
i
should
jolly
well
like
to
see
you
do
it
said
the
priest
unbelievingly
well
you
shall
said
cyril
nothing
easier
just
stand
close
round
do
you
need
no
preparation
no
fasting
no
incantations
the
priest
s
tone
was
incredulous
the
incantation
s
quite
short
said
cyril
taking
the
hint
and
as
for
fasting
it
s
not
needed
in
my
sort
of
magic
union
jack
printing
press
gunpowder
rule
britannia
come
fire
at
the
end
of
this
little
stick
he
had
pulled
a
match
from
his
pocket
and
as
he
ended
the
incantation
which
contained
no
words
that
it
seemed
likely
the
egyptian
had
ever
heard
he
stooped
in
the
little
crowd
of
his
relations
and
the
priest
and
struck
the
match
on
his
boot
he
stood
up
shielding
the
flame
with
one
hand
see
he
said
with
modest
pride
here
take
it
into
your
no
thank
you
said
the
priest
swiftly
backing
can
you
do
that
again
then
come
with
me
to
the
great
double
house
of
pharaoh
he
loves
good
magic
and
he
will
raise
you
to
honour
and
glory
there
s
no
need
of
secrets
between
initiates
he
went
on
confidentially
the
fact
is
i
am
out
of
favour
at
present
owing
to
a
little
matter
of
failure
of
prophecy
i
told
him
a
beautiful
princess
would
be
sent
to
him
from
syria
and
lo
a
woman
thirty
years
old
arrived
but
she
was
a
beautiful
woman
not
so
long
ago
time
is
only
a
mode
of
thought
you
the
children
thrilled
to
the
familiar
words
so
you
know
that
too
do
you
said
cyril
it
is
part
of
the
mystery
of
all
magic
is
it
not
said
the
priest
now
if
i
bring
you
to
pharaoh
the
little
unpleasantness
i
spoke
of
will
be
forgotten
and
i
will
ask
pharaoh
the
great
house
son
of
the
sun
and
lord
of
the
south
and
north
to
decree
that
you
shall
lodge
in
the
temple
then
you
can
have
a
good
look
round
and
teach
me
your
magic
and
i
will
teach
you
this
idea
seemed
good
at
least
it
was
better
than
any
other
which
at
that
moment
occurred
to
anybody
so
they
followed
the
priest
through
the
city
the
streets
were
very
narrow
and
dirty
the
best
houses
the
priest
explained
were
built
within
walls
twenty
to
feet
high
and
such
windows
as
showed
in
the
walls
were
very
high
up
the
tops
of
showed
above
the
walls
the
poor
people
s
houses
were
little
square
huts
with
a
door
and
two
windows
and
smoke
coming
out
of
a
hole
in
the
back
the
poor
egyptians
haven
t
improved
so
very
much
in
their
building
since
the
first
time
we
came
to
egypt
whispered
cyril
to
anthea
the
huts
were
roofed
with
palm
branches
and
everywhere
there
were
chickens
and
goats
and
little
naked
children
kicking
about
in
the
yellow
dust
on
one
roof
was
a
goat
who
had
climbed
up
and
was
eating
the
dry
with
snorts
and
of
delight
over
every
house
door
was
some
sort
of
figure
or
shape
amulets
the
priest
explained
to
keep
off
the
evil
i
don
t
think
much
of
your
nice
egypt
robert
whispered
to
jane
it
s
simply
not
a
patch
on
ah
you
wait
till
you
see
the
palace
jane
whispered
back
the
palace
was
indeed
much
more
magnificent
than
anything
they
had
yet
seen
that
day
though
it
would
have
made
but
a
poor
show
beside
that
of
the
babylonian
king
they
came
to
it
through
a
great
square
pillared
doorway
of
sandstone
that
stood
in
a
high
brick
wall
the
shut
doors
were
of
massive
cedar
with
bronze
hinges
and
were
studded
with
bronze
nails
at
the
side
was
a
little
door
and
a
wicket
gate
and
through
this
the
priest
led
the
children
he
seemed
to
know
a
word
that
made
the
sentries
make
way
for
him
inside
was
a
garden
planted
with
hundreds
of
different
kinds
of
trees
and
flowering
shrubs
a
lake
full
of
fish
with
blue
lotus
flowers
at
the
margin
and
ducks
swimming
about
cheerfully
and
looking
as
jane
said
quite
modern
the
the
the
queen
s
house
said
the
priest
pointing
them
out
they
passed
through
open
courtyards
paved
with
flat
stones
and
the
priest
whispered
to
a
guard
at
a
great
inner
gate
we
are
fortunate
he
said
to
the
children
pharaoh
is
even
now
in
the
court
of
honour
now
don
t
forget
to
be
overcome
with
respect
and
admiration
it
won
t
do
any
harm
if
you
fall
flat
on
your
faces
and
whatever
you
do
don
t
speak
until
you
re
spoken
there
used
to
be
that
rule
in
our
country
said
robert
when
my
father
was
a
little
at
the
outer
end
of
the
great
hall
a
crowd
of
people
were
arguing
with
and
even
shoving
the
guards
who
seemed
to
make
it
a
rule
not
to
let
anyone
through
unless
they
were
bribed
to
do
it
the
children
heard
several
promises
of
the
utmost
richness
and
wondered
whether
they
would
ever
be
kept
all
round
the
hall
were
pillars
of
painted
wood
the
roof
was
of
cedar
gorgeously
inlaid
about
up
the
hall
was
a
wide
shallow
step
that
went
right
across
the
hall
then
a
little
farther
on
another
and
then
a
steep
flight
of
narrower
steps
leading
right
up
to
the
throne
on
which
pharaoh
sat
he
sat
there
very
splendid
his
red
and
white
double
crown
on
his
head
and
his
sceptre
in
his
hand
the
throne
had
a
canopy
of
wood
and
wooden
pillars
painted
in
bright
colours
on
a
low
broad
bench
that
ran
all
round
the
hall
sat
the
friends
relatives
and
courtiers
of
the
king
leaning
on
cushions
the
priest
led
the
children
up
the
steps
till
they
all
stood
before
the
throne
and
then
suddenly
he
fell
on
his
face
with
hands
outstretched
the
others
did
the
same
anthea
falling
very
carefully
because
of
the
psammead
raise
them
said
the
voice
of
pharaoh
that
they
may
speak
to
the
officers
of
the
king
s
household
raised
them
who
are
these
strangers
pharaoh
asked
and
added
very
crossly
and
what
do
you
mean
by
daring
to
come
into
my
presence
while
your
innocence
is
not
established
oh
great
king
said
the
young
priest
you
are
the
very
image
of
ra
and
the
likeness
of
his
son
horus
in
every
respect
you
know
the
thoughts
of
the
hearts
of
the
gods
and
of
men
and
you
have
divined
that
these
strangers
are
the
children
of
the
children
of
the
vile
and
conquered
kings
of
the
empire
where
the
sun
never
sets
they
know
a
magic
not
known
to
the
egyptians
and
they
come
with
gifts
in
their
hands
as
tribute
to
pharaoh
in
whose
heart
is
the
wisdom
of
the
gods
and
on
his
lips
their
that
is
all
very
well
said
pharaoh
but
where
are
the
gifts
the
children
bowing
as
well
as
they
could
in
their
embarrassment
at
finding
themselves
the
centre
of
interest
in
a
circle
more
grand
more
golden
and
more
highly
coloured
than
they
could
have
imagined
possible
pulled
out
the
padlock
the
necessaire
and
the
but
it
s
not
tribute
all
the
same
cyril
muttered
england
doesn
t
pay
tribute
pharaoh
examined
all
the
things
with
great
interest
when
the
chief
of
the
household
had
taken
them
up
to
him
deliver
them
to
the
keeper
of
the
treasury
he
said
to
one
near
him
and
to
the
children
he
said
a
small
tribute
truly
but
strange
and
not
without
worth
and
the
magic
o
these
unworthy
sons
of
a
conquered
nation
began
nothing
of
the
kind
cyril
whispered
angrily
of
a
vile
and
conquered
nation
can
make
fire
to
spring
from
dry
wood
in
the
sight
of
i
should
jolly
well
like
to
see
them
do
it
said
pharaoh
just
as
the
priest
had
done
so
cyril
without
more
ado
did
it
do
more
magic
said
the
king
with
simple
appreciation
he
can
not
do
any
more
magic
said
anthea
suddenly
and
all
eyes
were
turned
on
her
because
of
the
voice
of
the
free
people
who
are
shouting
for
bread
and
onions
and
beer
and
a
long
rest
if
the
people
had
what
they
wanted
he
could
do
a
girl
said
pharaoh
but
give
the
dogs
what
they
want
he
said
without
turning
his
head
let
them
have
their
rest
and
their
extra
rations
there
are
plenty
of
slaves
to
a
official
hurried
out
you
will
be
the
idol
of
the
people
whispered
joyously
the
temple
of
amen
will
not
contain
their
cyril
struck
another
match
and
all
the
court
was
overwhelmed
with
delight
and
wonder
and
when
cyril
took
the
candle
from
his
pocket
and
lighted
it
with
the
match
and
then
held
the
burning
candle
up
before
the
king
the
enthusiasm
knew
no
bounds
oh
greatest
of
all
before
whom
sun
and
moon
and
stars
bow
down
said
insinuatingly
am
i
pardoned
is
my
innocence
made
plain
as
plain
as
it
ever
will
be
i
daresay
said
pharaoh
shortly
get
along
with
you
you
are
pardoned
go
in
the
priest
went
with
lightning
swiftness
and
what
said
the
king
suddenly
is
it
that
moves
in
that
sack
show
me
oh
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
show
the
psammead
seize
it
said
pharaoh
carelessly
a
very
curious
monkey
it
will
be
a
nice
little
novelty
for
my
wild
beast
and
instantly
the
entreaties
of
the
children
availing
as
little
as
the
bites
of
the
psammead
though
both
bites
and
entreaties
were
fervent
it
was
carried
away
from
before
their
eyes
oh
do
be
careful
cried
anthea
at
least
keep
it
dry
keep
it
in
its
sacred
house
she
held
up
the
embroidered
bag
it
s
a
magic
creature
cried
robert
it
s
simply
priceless
you
ve
no
right
to
take
it
away
cried
jane
incautiously
it
s
a
shame
a
barefaced
robbery
that
s
what
it
is
there
was
an
awful
silence
then
pharaoh
spoke
take
the
sacred
house
of
the
beast
from
them
he
said
and
imprison
all
tonight
after
supper
it
may
be
our
pleasure
to
see
more
magic
guard
them
well
and
do
not
torture
them
yet
oh
dear
sobbed
jane
as
they
were
led
away
i
knew
exactly
what
it
would
be
oh
i
wish
you
hadn
t
shut
up
silly
said
cyril
you
know
you
would
come
to
egypt
it
was
your
own
idea
entirely
shut
up
it
ll
be
all
i
thought
we
should
play
ball
with
queens
sobbed
jane
and
have
no
end
of
larks
and
now
everything
s
going
to
be
perfectly
horrid
the
room
they
were
shut
up
in
was
a
room
and
not
a
dungeon
as
the
elder
ones
had
feared
that
as
anthea
said
was
one
comfort
there
were
paintings
on
the
wall
that
at
any
other
time
would
have
been
most
interesting
and
a
sort
of
low
couch
and
chairs
when
they
were
alone
jane
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
now
we
can
get
home
all
right
she
said
and
leave
the
psammead
said
anthea
reproachfully
wait
a
sec
i
ve
got
an
idea
said
cyril
he
pondered
for
a
few
moments
then
he
began
hammering
on
the
heavy
cedar
door
it
opened
and
a
guard
put
in
his
head
stop
that
row
he
said
sternly
or
look
here
cyril
interrupted
it
s
very
dull
for
you
isn
t
it
just
doing
nothing
but
guard
us
wouldn
t
you
like
to
see
some
magic
we
re
not
too
proud
to
do
it
for
you
wouldn
t
you
like
to
see
it
i
don
t
mind
if
i
do
said
the
guard
well
then
you
get
us
that
monkey
of
ours
that
was
taken
away
and
we
ll
show
how
do
i
know
you
re
not
making
game
of
me
asked
the
soldier
shouldn
t
wonder
if
you
only
wanted
to
get
the
creature
so
as
to
set
it
on
me
i
daresay
its
teeth
and
claws
are
well
look
here
said
robert
you
see
we
ve
got
nothing
with
us
you
just
shut
the
door
and
open
it
again
in
five
minutes
and
we
ll
have
got
a
magic
oh
i
don
t
know
a
magic
flower
in
a
pot
for
if
you
can
do
that
you
can
do
anything
said
the
soldier
and
he
went
out
and
barred
the
door
then
of
course
they
held
up
the
amulet
they
found
the
east
by
holding
it
up
and
turning
slowly
till
the
amulet
began
to
grow
big
walked
home
through
it
and
came
back
with
a
geranium
in
full
scarlet
flower
from
the
staircase
window
of
the
fitzroy
street
house
well
said
the
soldier
when
he
came
in
i
really
am
we
can
do
much
more
wonderful
things
than
that
oh
ever
so
much
said
anthea
persuasively
if
we
only
have
our
monkey
and
here
s
twopence
for
the
soldier
looked
at
the
twopence
what
s
this
he
said
robert
explained
how
much
simpler
it
was
to
pay
money
for
things
than
to
exchange
them
as
the
people
were
doing
in
the
market
later
on
the
soldier
gave
the
coins
to
his
captain
who
later
still
showed
them
to
pharaoh
who
of
course
kept
them
and
was
much
struck
with
the
idea
that
was
really
how
coins
first
came
to
be
used
in
egypt
you
will
not
believe
this
i
daresay
but
really
if
you
believe
the
rest
of
the
story
i
don
t
see
why
you
shouldn
t
believe
this
as
well
i
say
said
anthea
struck
by
a
sudden
thought
i
suppose
it
ll
be
all
right
about
those
workmen
the
king
won
t
go
back
on
what
he
said
about
them
just
because
he
s
angry
with
us
oh
no
said
the
soldier
you
see
he
s
rather
afraid
of
magic
he
ll
keep
to
his
word
right
then
that
s
all
right
said
robert
and
anthea
said
softly
and
coaxingly
ah
do
get
us
the
monkey
and
then
you
ll
see
some
lovely
magic
do
there
s
a
nice
kind
i
don
t
know
where
they
ve
put
your
precious
monkey
but
if
i
can
get
another
chap
to
take
on
my
duty
here
i
ll
see
what
i
can
do
he
said
grudgingly
and
went
out
do
you
mean
said
robert
that
we
re
going
off
without
even
trying
for
the
other
half
of
the
amulet
i
really
think
we
d
better
said
anthea
tremulously
of
course
the
other
half
of
the
amulet
s
here
somewhere
or
our
half
wouldn
t
have
brought
us
here
i
do
wish
we
could
find
it
it
is
a
pity
we
don
t
know
any
real
magic
then
we
could
find
out
i
do
wonder
where
it
is
if
they
had
only
known
it
something
very
like
the
other
half
of
the
amulet
was
very
near
them
it
hung
round
the
neck
of
someone
and
that
someone
was
watching
them
through
a
chink
high
up
in
the
wall
specially
devised
for
watching
people
who
were
imprisoned
but
they
did
not
know
there
was
nearly
an
hour
of
anxious
waiting
they
tried
to
take
an
interest
in
the
picture
on
the
wall
a
picture
of
harpers
playing
very
odd
harps
and
women
dancing
at
a
feast
they
examined
the
painted
plaster
floor
and
the
chairs
were
of
white
painted
wood
with
coloured
stripes
at
intervals
but
the
time
went
slowly
and
everyone
had
time
to
think
of
how
pharaoh
had
said
don
t
torture
them
if
the
worst
comes
to
the
worst
said
cyril
we
must
just
bunk
and
leave
the
psammead
i
believe
it
can
take
care
of
itself
well
enough
they
won
t
kill
it
or
hurt
it
when
they
find
it
can
speak
and
give
wishes
they
ll
build
it
a
temple
i
shouldn
t
i
couldn
t
bear
to
go
without
it
said
anthea
and
pharaoh
said
after
supper
that
won
t
be
just
yet
and
the
soldier
was
curious
i
m
sure
we
re
all
right
for
the
all
the
same
the
sounds
of
the
door
being
unbarred
seemed
one
of
the
prettiest
sounds
possible
suppose
he
hasn
t
got
the
psammead
whispered
jane
but
that
doubt
was
set
at
rest
by
the
psammead
itself
for
almost
before
the
door
was
open
it
sprang
through
the
chink
of
it
into
anthea
s
arms
shivering
and
hunching
up
its
fur
here
s
its
fancy
overcoat
said
the
soldier
holding
out
the
bag
into
which
the
psammead
immediately
crept
now
said
cyril
what
would
you
like
us
to
do
anything
you
d
like
us
to
get
for
you
any
little
trick
you
like
said
the
soldier
if
you
can
get
a
strange
flower
blooming
in
an
earthenware
vase
you
can
get
anything
i
suppose
he
said
i
just
wish
i
d
got
two
men
s
loads
of
jewels
from
the
king
s
treasury
that
s
what
i
ve
always
wished
at
the
word
wish
the
children
knew
that
the
psammead
would
attend
to
that
bit
of
magic
it
did
and
the
floor
was
littered
with
a
spreading
heap
of
gold
and
precious
stones
any
other
little
trick
asked
cyril
loftily
shall
we
become
invisible
vanish
yes
if
you
like
said
the
soldier
but
not
through
the
door
you
don
he
closed
it
carefully
and
set
his
broad
egyptian
back
against
it
no
no
cried
a
voice
high
up
among
the
tops
of
the
tall
wooden
pillars
that
stood
against
the
wall
there
was
a
sound
of
someone
moving
above
the
soldier
was
as
much
surprised
as
anybody
that
s
magic
if
you
like
he
said
and
then
jane
held
up
the
amulet
uttering
the
word
of
power
at
the
sound
of
it
and
at
the
sight
of
the
amulet
growing
into
the
great
arch
the
soldier
fell
flat
on
his
face
among
the
jewels
with
a
cry
of
awe
and
terror
the
children
went
through
the
arch
with
a
quickness
born
of
long
practice
but
jane
stayed
in
the
middle
of
the
arch
and
looked
back
the
others
standing
on
the
carpet
in
fitzroy
street
turned
and
saw
her
still
in
the
arch
someone
s
holding
her
cried
cyril
we
must
go
but
they
pulled
at
jane
s
hands
just
to
see
if
she
would
come
and
of
course
she
did
come
then
as
usual
the
arch
was
little
again
and
there
they
all
were
oh
i
do
wish
you
hadn
t
jane
said
crossly
it
was
so
interesting
the
priest
had
come
in
and
he
was
kicking
the
soldier
and
telling
him
he
d
done
it
now
and
they
must
take
the
jewels
and
flee
for
their
and
did
they
i
don
t
know
you
interfered
said
jane
ungratefully
i
should
have
liked
to
see
the
last
of
as
a
matter
of
fact
none
of
them
had
seen
the
last
of
it
if
by
it
jane
meant
the
adventure
of
the
priest
and
the
soldier
chapter
the
and
the
expelled
little
boy
look
here
said
cyril
sitting
on
the
and
swinging
his
legs
i
really
have
got
got
what
was
the
not
unnatural
rejoinder
of
the
others
cyril
was
making
a
boat
with
a
penknife
and
a
piece
of
wood
and
the
girls
were
making
warm
frocks
for
their
dolls
for
the
weather
was
growing
chilly
why
don
t
you
see
it
s
really
not
any
good
our
going
into
the
past
looking
for
that
amulet
the
past
s
as
full
of
different
times
as
as
the
sea
is
of
sand
we
re
simply
bound
to
hit
upon
the
wrong
time
we
might
spend
our
lives
looking
for
the
amulet
and
never
see
a
sight
of
it
why
it
s
the
end
of
september
already
it
s
like
looking
for
a
needle
in
a
bottle
of
hay
i
know
interrupted
robert
but
if
we
don
t
go
on
doing
that
what
are
we
to
do
that
s
just
it
said
cyril
in
mysterious
accents
oh
bother
old
nurse
had
come
in
with
the
tray
of
knives
forks
and
glasses
and
was
getting
the
tablecloth
and
out
of
the
chiffonier
drawer
it
s
always
just
when
you
come
to
anything
and
a
nice
interesting
handful
you
d
be
master
cyril
said
old
nurse
if
i
wasn
t
to
bring
your
meals
up
to
time
don
t
you
begin
grumbling
now
fear
you
get
something
to
grumble
i
wasn
t
grumbling
said
cyril
quite
untruly
but
it
does
always
happen
like
you
deserve
to
have
something
happen
said
old
nurse
slave
slave
slave
for
you
day
and
night
and
never
a
word
of
thanks
why
you
do
everything
beautifully
said
anthea
it
s
the
first
time
any
of
you
s
troubled
to
say
so
anyhow
said
nurse
shortly
what
s
the
use
of
saying
inquired
robert
we
eat
our
meals
fast
enough
and
almost
always
two
helps
that
ought
to
show
you
ah
said
old
nurse
going
round
the
table
and
putting
the
knives
and
forks
in
their
places
you
re
a
man
all
over
master
robert
there
was
my
poor
green
all
the
years
he
lived
with
me
i
never
could
get
more
out
of
him
than
it
s
all
right
when
i
asked
him
if
he
d
fancied
his
dinner
and
yet
when
he
lay
his
last
words
to
me
was
maria
you
was
always
a
good
cook
she
ended
with
a
trembling
voice
and
so
you
are
cried
anthea
and
she
and
jane
instantly
hugged
her
when
she
had
gone
out
of
the
room
anthea
said
i
know
exactly
how
she
feels
now
look
here
let
s
do
a
penance
to
show
we
re
sorry
we
didn
t
think
about
telling
her
before
what
nice
cooking
she
does
and
what
a
dear
she
penances
are
silly
said
robert
not
if
the
penance
is
something
to
please
someone
else
i
didn
t
mean
old
peas
and
hair
shirts
and
sleeping
on
the
stones
i
mean
we
ll
make
her
a
explained
anthea
look
here
i
vote
cyril
doesn
t
tell
us
his
idea
until
we
ve
done
something
for
old
nurse
it
s
worse
for
us
than
him
she
added
hastily
because
he
knows
what
it
is
and
we
don
t
do
you
all
agree
the
others
would
have
been
ashamed
not
to
agree
so
they
did
it
was
not
till
quite
near
the
end
of
dinner
mutton
fritters
and
blackberry
and
apple
pie
that
out
of
the
earnest
talk
of
the
four
came
an
idea
that
pleased
everybody
and
would
they
hoped
please
nurse
cyril
and
robert
went
out
with
the
taste
of
apple
still
in
their
mouths
and
the
purple
of
blackberries
on
their
lips
and
in
the
case
of
robert
on
the
wristband
as
well
and
bought
a
big
sheet
of
cardboard
at
the
stationers
then
at
the
plumber
s
shop
that
has
tubes
and
pipes
and
taps
and
in
the
window
they
bought
a
pane
of
glass
the
same
size
as
the
cardboard
the
man
cut
it
with
a
very
interesting
tool
that
had
a
bit
of
diamond
at
the
end
and
he
gave
them
out
of
his
own
free
generousness
a
large
piece
of
putty
and
a
small
piece
of
glue
while
they
were
out
the
girls
had
floated
four
photographs
of
the
four
children
off
their
cards
in
hot
water
these
were
now
stuck
in
a
row
along
the
top
of
the
cardboard
cyril
put
the
glue
to
melt
in
a
jampot
and
put
the
jampot
in
a
saucepan
and
saucepan
on
the
fire
while
robert
painted
a
wreath
of
poppies
round
the
photographs
he
painted
rather
well
and
very
quickly
and
poppies
are
easy
to
do
if
you
ve
once
been
shown
how
then
anthea
drew
some
printed
letters
and
jane
coloured
them
the
words
were
with
all
our
loves
to
shew
we
like
the
thigs
to
and
when
the
painting
was
dry
they
all
signed
their
names
at
the
bottom
and
put
the
glass
on
and
glued
brown
paper
round
the
edge
and
over
the
back
and
put
two
loops
of
tape
to
hang
it
up
by
of
course
everyone
saw
when
too
late
that
there
were
not
enough
letters
in
things
so
the
missing
n
was
put
in
it
was
impossible
of
course
to
do
the
whole
thing
over
again
for
just
one
letter
there
said
anthea
placing
it
carefully
face
up
under
the
sofa
it
ll
be
hours
before
the
glue
s
dry
now
squirrel
fire
ahead
well
then
said
cyril
in
a
great
hurry
rubbing
at
his
gluey
hands
with
his
pocket
handkerchief
what
i
mean
to
say
is
there
was
a
long
pause
well
said
robert
at
last
what
is
it
that
you
mean
to
say
it
s
like
this
said
cyril
and
again
stopped
short
like
what
asked
jane
how
can
i
tell
you
if
you
will
all
keep
on
interrupting
said
cyril
sharply
so
no
one
said
any
more
and
with
wrinkled
frowns
he
arranged
his
ideas
look
here
he
said
what
i
really
mean
is
we
can
remember
now
what
we
did
when
we
went
to
look
for
the
amulet
and
if
we
d
found
it
we
should
remember
that
rather
said
robert
only
you
see
we
haven
but
in
the
future
we
shall
shall
we
though
said
jane
yes
unless
we
ve
been
made
fools
of
by
the
psammead
so
then
where
we
want
to
go
to
is
where
we
shall
remember
about
where
we
did
find
i
see
said
robert
but
he
didn
t
don
t
said
anthea
who
did
very
nearly
say
it
again
squirrel
and
very
if
said
cyril
very
slowly
indeed
we
go
into
the
future
after
we
ve
found
the
amulet
but
we
ve
got
to
find
it
first
said
jane
hush
said
anthea
there
will
be
a
future
said
cyril
driven
to
greater
clearness
by
the
blank
faces
of
the
other
three
there
will
be
a
time
after
we
ve
found
it
let
s
go
into
that
time
and
then
we
shall
remember
how
we
found
it
and
then
we
can
go
back
and
do
the
finding
i
see
said
robert
and
this
time
he
did
and
i
hope
you
do
yes
said
anthea
oh
squirrel
how
clever
of
you
but
will
the
amulet
work
both
ways
inquired
robert
it
ought
to
said
cyril
if
time
s
only
a
thingummy
of
whatsitsname
anyway
we
might
let
s
put
on
our
best
things
then
urged
jane
you
know
what
people
say
about
progress
and
the
world
growing
better
and
brighter
i
expect
people
will
be
awfully
smart
in
the
all
right
said
anthea
we
should
have
to
wash
anyway
i
m
all
thick
with
when
everyone
was
clean
and
dressed
the
charm
was
held
up
we
want
to
go
into
the
future
and
see
the
amulet
after
we
ve
found
it
said
cyril
and
jane
said
the
word
of
power
they
walked
through
the
big
arch
of
the
charm
straight
into
the
british
museum
they
knew
it
at
once
and
there
right
in
front
of
them
under
a
glass
case
was
the
amulet
their
own
half
of
it
as
well
as
the
other
half
they
had
never
been
able
to
find
and
the
two
were
joined
by
a
pin
of
red
stone
that
formed
a
hinge
oh
glorious
cried
robert
here
it
is
yes
said
cyril
very
gloomily
here
it
is
but
we
can
t
get
it
no
said
robert
remembering
how
impossible
the
queen
of
babylon
had
found
it
to
get
anything
out
of
the
glass
cases
in
the
museum
except
by
psammead
magic
and
then
she
hadn
t
been
able
to
take
anything
away
with
her
no
but
we
remember
where
we
got
it
and
we
can
oh
do
we
interrupted
cyril
bitterly
do
you
remember
where
we
got
it
no
said
robert
i
don
t
exactly
now
i
come
to
think
of
nor
did
any
of
the
others
but
why
can
t
we
said
jane
oh
don
t
know
cyril
s
tone
was
impatient
some
silly
old
enchanted
rule
i
suppose
i
wish
people
would
teach
you
magic
at
school
like
they
do
sums
or
instead
of
it
would
be
some
use
having
an
amulet
i
wonder
how
far
we
are
in
the
future
said
anthea
the
museum
looks
just
the
same
only
lighter
and
brighter
let
s
go
back
and
try
the
past
again
said
robert
perhaps
the
museum
people
could
tell
us
how
we
got
it
said
anthea
with
sudden
hope
there
was
no
one
in
the
room
but
in
the
next
gallery
where
the
assyrian
things
are
and
still
were
they
found
a
kind
stout
man
in
a
loose
blue
gown
and
stockinged
legs
oh
they
ve
got
a
new
uniform
how
pretty
said
jane
when
they
asked
him
their
question
he
showed
them
a
label
on
the
case
it
said
from
the
collection
of
a
name
followed
and
it
was
the
name
of
the
learned
gentleman
who
among
themselves
and
to
his
face
when
he
had
been
with
them
at
the
other
side
of
the
amulet
they
had
called
jimmy
that
s
not
much
good
said
cyril
thank
how
is
it
you
re
not
at
school
asked
the
kind
man
in
blue
not
expelled
for
long
i
hope
we
re
not
expelled
at
all
said
cyril
rather
warmly
well
i
shouldn
t
do
it
again
if
i
were
you
said
the
man
and
they
could
see
he
did
not
believe
them
there
is
no
company
so
little
pleasing
as
that
of
people
who
do
not
believe
you
thank
you
for
showing
us
the
label
said
cyril
and
they
came
away
as
they
came
through
the
doors
of
the
museum
they
blinked
at
the
sudden
glory
of
sunlight
and
blue
sky
the
houses
opposite
the
museum
were
gone
instead
there
was
a
big
garden
with
trees
and
flowers
and
smooth
green
lawns
and
not
a
single
notice
to
tell
you
not
to
walk
on
the
grass
and
not
to
destroy
the
trees
and
shrubs
and
not
to
pick
the
flowers
there
were
comfortable
seats
all
about
and
arbours
covered
with
roses
and
long
trellised
walks
also
whispering
splashing
fountains
fell
into
full
white
marble
basins
white
statues
gleamed
among
the
leaves
and
the
pigeons
that
swept
about
among
the
branches
or
pecked
on
the
smooth
soft
gravel
were
not
black
and
tumbled
like
the
museum
pigeons
are
now
but
bright
and
clean
and
sleek
as
birds
of
new
silver
a
good
many
people
were
sitting
on
the
seats
and
on
the
grass
babies
were
rolling
and
kicking
and
playing
with
very
little
on
indeed
men
as
well
as
women
seemed
to
be
in
charge
of
the
babies
and
were
playing
with
them
it
s
like
a
lovely
picture
said
anthea
and
it
was
for
the
people
s
clothes
were
of
bright
soft
colours
and
all
beautifully
and
very
simply
made
no
one
seemed
to
have
any
hats
or
bonnets
but
there
were
a
great
many
sunshades
and
among
the
trees
were
hung
lamps
of
coloured
glass
i
expect
they
light
those
in
the
evening
said
jane
i
do
wish
we
lived
in
the
future
they
walked
down
the
path
and
as
they
went
the
people
on
the
benches
looked
at
the
four
children
very
curiously
but
not
rudely
or
unkindly
the
children
in
their
turn
looked
i
hope
they
did
not
stare
at
the
faces
of
these
people
in
the
beautiful
soft
clothes
those
faces
were
worth
looking
at
not
that
they
were
all
handsome
though
even
in
the
matter
of
handsomeness
they
had
the
advantage
of
any
set
of
people
the
children
had
ever
seen
but
it
was
the
expression
of
their
faces
that
made
them
worth
looking
at
the
children
could
not
tell
at
first
what
it
was
i
know
said
anthea
suddenly
they
re
not
worried
that
s
what
it
and
it
was
everybody
looked
calm
no
one
seemed
to
be
in
a
hurry
no
one
seemed
to
be
anxious
or
fretted
and
though
some
did
seem
to
be
sad
not
a
single
one
looked
worried
but
though
the
people
looked
kind
everyone
looked
so
interested
in
the
children
that
they
began
to
feel
a
little
shy
and
turned
out
of
the
big
main
path
into
a
narrow
little
one
that
wound
among
trees
and
shrubs
and
mossy
dripping
springs
it
was
here
in
a
deep
shadowed
cleft
between
tall
cypresses
that
they
found
the
expelled
little
boy
he
was
lying
face
downward
on
the
mossy
turf
and
the
peculiar
shaking
of
his
shoulders
was
a
thing
they
had
seen
more
than
once
in
each
other
so
anthea
kneeled
down
by
him
and
said
what
s
the
matter
i
m
expelled
from
school
said
the
boy
between
his
sobs
this
was
serious
people
are
not
expelled
for
light
offences
do
you
mind
telling
us
what
you
d
done
i
i
tore
up
a
sheet
of
paper
and
threw
it
about
in
the
playground
said
the
child
in
the
tone
of
one
confessing
an
unutterable
baseness
you
won
t
talk
to
me
any
more
now
you
know
that
he
added
without
looking
up
was
that
all
asked
anthea
it
s
about
enough
said
the
child
and
i
m
expelled
for
the
whole
day
i
don
t
quite
understand
said
anthea
gently
the
boy
lifted
his
face
rolled
over
and
sat
up
why
whoever
on
earth
are
you
he
said
we
re
strangers
from
a
far
country
said
anthea
in
our
country
it
s
not
a
crime
to
leave
a
bit
of
paper
it
is
here
said
the
child
if
do
it
they
re
fined
when
we
do
it
we
re
expelled
for
the
whole
well
but
said
robert
that
just
means
a
day
s
you
must
come
from
a
long
way
off
said
the
little
boy
a
holiday
s
when
you
all
have
play
and
treats
and
jolliness
all
of
you
together
on
your
expelled
days
no
one
ll
speak
to
you
everyone
sees
you
re
an
expelleder
or
you
d
be
in
suppose
you
were
ill
nobody

hardly
if
they
are
of
course
they
wear
the
badge
and
everyone
is
kind
to
you
i
know
a
boy
that
stole
his
sister
s
illness
badge
and
wore
it
when
he
was
expelled
for
a
day
he
got
expelled
for
a
week
for
that
it
must
be
awful
not
to
go
to
school
for
a
do
you

asked
robert
incredulously
of
course

loveliest
place

chose
railways
for
my
special
subject
this
year
there

splendid
models
and
things
and
now
i

subject
asked
cyril
yes
of
course
where

t

jane
definitely
so

midsummer
day

flowers

other
subjects

rules

said
anthea
look
here
said
the
child
jumping
up
it
s
nearly
four
the
expelledness
only
lasts
till
then
come
home
with
me
mother
will
tell
you
all
about
will
your
mother
like
you
taking
home
strange
children
asked
anthea
i
don
t
understand
said
the
child
settling
his
leather
belt
over
his
smock
and
stepping
out
with
hard
little
bare
feet
come
so
they
went
the
streets
were
wide
and
hard
and
very
clean
there
were
no
horses
but
a
sort
of
motor
carriage
that
made
no
noise
the
thames
flowed
between
green
banks
and
there
were
trees
at
the
edge
and
people
sat
under
them
fishing
for
the
stream
was
clear
as
crystal
everywhere
there
were
green
trees
and
there
was
no
smoke
the
houses
were
set
in
what
seemed
like
one
green
garden
the
little
boy
brought
them
to
a
house
and
at
the
window
was
a
good
bright
the
little
boy
rushed
in
and
through
the
window
they
could
see
him
hugging
his
mother
then
his
eager
lips
moving
and
his
quick
hands
pointing
a
lady
in
soft
green
clothes
came
out
spoke
kindly
to
them
and
took
them
into
the
oddest
house
they
had
ever
seen
it
was
very
bare
there
were
no
ornaments
and
yet
every
single
thing
was
beautiful
from
the
dresser
with
its
rows
of
bright
china
to
the
thick
squares
of
carpet
on
the
floors
i
can
t
describe
that
house
i
haven
t
the
time
and
i
haven
t
heart
either
when
i
think
how
different
it
was
from
our
houses
the
lady
took
them
all
over
it
the
oddest
thing
of
all
was
the
big
room
in
the
middle
it
had
padded
walls
and
a
soft
thick
carpet
and
all
the
chairs
and
tables
were
padded
there
wasn
t
a
single
thing
in
it
that
anyone
could
hurt
itself
with
what
ever
s
this
for
lunatics
asked
cyril
the
lady
looked
very
shocked
no
it
s
for
the
children
of
course
she
said
don
t
tell
me
that
in
your
country
there
are
no
children
s
there
are
nurseries
said
anthea
doubtfully
but
the
furniture
s
all
cornery
and
hard
like
other
how
shocking
said
the
lady
you
must
be
very
much
behind
the
times
in
your
country
why
the
children
are
more
than
half
of
the
people
it
s
not
much
to
have
one
room
where
they
can
have
a
good
time
and
not
hurt
but
there
s
no
fireplace
said
anthea
pipes
of
course
said
the
lady
why
how
could
you
have
a
fire
in
a
nursery
a
child
might
get
in
our
country
said
robert
suddenly
more
than
children
are
burned
to
death
every
year
father
told
me
he
added
as
if
apologizing
for
this
piece
of
information
once
when
i
d
been
playing
with
the
lady
turned
quite
pale
what
a
frightful
place
you
must
live
in
she
said
what
s
all
the
furniture
padded
for
anthea
asked
hastily
turning
the
subject
why
you
couldn
t
have
little
tots
of
two
or
three
running
about
in
rooms
where
the
things
were
hard
and
sharp
they
might
hurt
robert
fingered
the
scar
on
his
forehead
where
he
had
hit
it
against
the
nursery
fender
when
he
was
little
but
does
everyone
have
rooms
like
this
poor
people
and
all
asked
anthea
there
s
a
room
like
this
wherever
there
s
a
child
of
course
said
the
lady
how
refreshingly
ignorant
you
are
no
i
don
t
mean
ignorant
my
dear
of
course
you
re
awfully
well
up
in
ancient
history
but
i
see
you
haven
t
done
your
duties
of
citizenship
course
but
beggars
and
people
like
that
persisted
anthea
and
tramps
and
people
who
haven
t
any
homes
people
who
haven
t
any
homes
repeated
the
lady
i
really
don
t
understand
what
you
re
talking
it
s
all
different
in
our
country
said
cyril
carefully
and
i
have
read
it
used
to
be
different
in
london
usedn
t
people
to
have
no
homes
and
beg
because
they
were
hungry
and
wasn
t
london
very
black
and
dirty
once
upon
a
time
and
the
thames
all
muddy
and
filthy
and
narrow
streets
and
you
must
have
been
reading
very
books
said
the
lady
why
all
that
was
in
the
dark
ages
my
husband
can
tell
you
more
about
it
than
i
can
he
took
ancient
history
as
one
of
his
special
i
haven
t
seen
any
working
people
said
anthea
why
we
re
all
working
people
said
the
lady
at
least
my
husband
s
a
good
gracious
said
anthea
but
you
re
a
lady
ah
said
the
lady
that
quaint
old
word
well
my
husband
will
enjoy
a
talk
with
you
in
the
dark
ages
everyone
was
allowed
to
have
a
smoky
chimney
and
those
nasty
horses
all
over
the
streets
and
all
sorts
of
rubbish
thrown
into
the
thames
and
of
course
the
sufferings
of
the
people
will
hardly
bear
thinking
of
it
s
very
learned
of
you
to
know
it
all
did
you
make
ancient
history
your
special
subject
not
exactly
said
cyril
rather
uneasily
what
is
the
duties
of
citizenship
course
about
don
t
you
really
know
aren
t
you
pretending
just
for
fun
really
not
well
that
course
teaches
you
how
to
be
a
good
citizen
what
you
must
do
and
what
you
mayn
t
do
so
as
to
do
your
full
share
of
the
work
of
making
your
town
a
beautiful
and
happy
place
for
people
to
live
in
there
s
a
quite
simple
little
thing
they
teach
the
tiny
children
how
does
it
go
i
must
not
steal
and
i
must
learn
nothing
is
mine
that
i
do
not
earn
i
must
try
in
work
and
play
to
make
things
beautiful
every
day
i
must
be
kind
to
everyone
and
never
let
cruel
things
be
done
i
must
be
brave
and
i
must
try
when
i
am
hurt
never
to
cry
and
always
laugh
as
much
as
i
can
and
be
glad
that
i
m
going
to
be
a
man
to
work
for
my
living
and
help
the
rest
and
never
do
less
than
my
very
that
s
very
easy
said
jane
could
remember
that
s
only
the
very
beginning
of
course
said
the
lady
there
are
heaps
more
rhymes
there
s
the
one
beginning
i
must
not
litter
the
beautiful
street
with
bits
of
paper
or
things
to
eat
i
must
not
pick
the
public
flowers
they
are
not
mine
but
they
are
and
things
to
eat
reminds
me
are
you
hungry
wells
run
and
get
a
tray
of
nice
why
do
you
call
him
wells
asked
robert
as
the
boy
ran
off
it
s
after
the
great
reformer
surely
you
ve
heard
of
him
he
lived
in
the
dark
ages
and
he
saw
that
what
you
ought
to
do
is
to
find
out
what
you
want
and
then
try
to
get
it
up
to
then
people
had
always
tried
to
tinker
up
what
they
d
got
we
ve
got
a
great
many
of
the
things
he
thought
of
then
wells
means
springs
of
clear
water
it
s
a
nice
name
don
t
you
think
here
wells
returned
with
strawberries
and
cakes
and
lemonade
on
a
tray
and
everybody
ate
and
enjoyed
now
wells
said
the
lady
run
off
or
you
ll
be
late
and
not
meet
your
wells
kissed
her
waved
to
the
others
and
went
look
here
said
anthea
suddenly
would
you
like
to
come
to
our
country
and
see
what
it
s
like
it
wouldn
t
take
you
a
the
lady
laughed
but
jane
held
up
the
charm
and
said
the
word
what
a
splendid
conjuring
trick
cried
the
lady
enchanted
with
the
beautiful
growing
arch
go
through
said
anthea
the
lady
went
laughing
but
she
did
not
laugh
when
she
found
herself
suddenly
in
the
at
fitzroy
street
oh
what
a
horrible
trick
she
cried
what
a
hateful
dark
ugly
place
she
ran
to
the
window
and
looked
out
the
sky
was
grey
the
street
was
foggy
a
dismal
was
standing
opposite
the
door
a
beggar
and
a
man
who
sold
matches
were
quarrelling
at
the
edge
of
the
pavement
on
whose
greasy
black
surface
people
hurried
along
hastening
to
get
to
the
shelter
of
their
houses
oh
look
at
their
faces
their
horrible
faces
she
cried
what
s
the
matter
with
them
all
they
re
poor
people
that
s
all
said
robert
but
it
s
not
all
they
re
ill
they
re
unhappy
they
re
wicked
oh
do
stop
it
there
s
dear
children
it
s
very
very
clever
some
sort
of
trick
i
suppose
like
i
ve
read
of
but
do
stop
it
oh
their
poor
tired
miserable
wicked
faces
the
tears
were
in
her
eyes
anthea
signed
to
jane
the
arch
grew
they
spoke
the
words
and
pushed
the
lady
through
it
into
her
own
time
and
place
where
london
is
clean
and
beautiful
and
the
thames
runs
clear
and
bright
and
the
green
trees
grow
and
no
one
is
afraid
or
anxious
or
in
a
hurry
there
was
a
silence
then
i
m
glad
we
went
said
anthea
with
a
deep
breath
i
ll
never
throw
paper
about
again
as
long
as
i
live
said
robert
mother
always
told
us
not
to
said
jane
i
would
like
to
take
up
the
duties
of
citizenship
for
a
special
subject
said
cyril
i
wonder
if
father
could
put
me
through
it
i
shall
ask
him
when
he
comes
if
we
d
found
the
amulet
father
could
be
home
now
said
anthea
and
mother
and
the
let
s
go
into
the
future
again
suggested
jane
brightly
perhaps
we
could
remember
if
it
wasn
t
such
an
awful
way
so
they
did
this
time
they
said
the
future
where
the
amulet
is
not
so
far
and
they
went
through
the
familiar
arch
into
a
large
light
room
with
three
windows
facing
them
was
the
familiar
and
at
a
table
by
the
window
sat
the
learned
gentleman
they
knew
him
at
once
though
his
hair
was
white
he
was
one
of
the
faces
that
do
not
change
with
age
in
his
hand
was
the
amulet
complete
and
perfect
he
rubbed
his
other
hand
across
his
forehead
in
the
way
they
were
so
used
to
dreams
dreams
he
said
old
age
is
full
of
them
you
ve
been
in
dreams
with
us
before
now
said
robert
don
t
you
remember
i
do
indeed
said
he
the
room
had
many
more
books
than
the
fitzroy
street
room
and
far
more
curious
and
wonderful
assyrian
and
egyptian
objects
the
most
wonderful
dreams
i
ever
had
had
you
in
where
asked
cyril
did
you
get
that
thing
in
your
hand
if
you
weren
t
just
a
dream
he
answered
smiling
you
d
remember
that
you
gave
it
to
but
where
did
we
get
it
cyril
asked
eagerly
ah
you
never
would
tell
me
that
he
said
you
always
had
your
little
mysteries
you
dear
children
what
a
difference
you
made
to
that
old
bloomsbury
house
i
wish
i
could
dream
you
oftener
now
you
re
grown
up
you
re
not
like
you
used
to
grown
up
said
anthea
the
learned
gentleman
pointed
to
a
frame
with
four
photographs
in
it
there
you
are
he
said
the
children
saw
four
people
s
portraits
two
ladies
two
gentlemen
and
looked
on
them
with
loathing
shall
we
grow
up
like
that
whispered
jane
how
perfectly
horrid
if
we
re
ever
like
that
we
sha
n
t
know
it
s
horrid
i
expect
anthea
with
some
insight
whispered
back
you
see
you
get
used
to
yourself
while
you
re
changing
it
s
it
s
being
so
sudden
makes
it
seem
so
frightful
the
learned
gentleman
was
looking
at
them
with
wistful
kindness
don
t
let
me
undream
you
just
yet
he
said
there
was
a
pause
do
you
remember
when
we
gave
you
that
amulet
cyril
asked
suddenly
you
know
or
you
would
if
you
weren
t
a
dream
that
it
was
on
the
december
i
shall
never
forget
that
thank
you
said
cyril
earnestly
oh
thank
you
very
you
ve
got
a
new
room
said
anthea
looking
out
of
the
window
and
what
a
lovely
garden
yes
said
he
i
m
too
old
now
to
care
even
about
being
near
the
museum
this
is
a
beautiful
place
do
you
know
i
can
hardly
believe
you
re
just
a
dream
you
do
look
so
exactly
real
do
you
know
his
voice
dropped
i
can
say
it
to
you
though
of
course
if
i
said
it
to
anyone
that
wasn
t
a
dream
they
d
call
me
mad
there
was
something
about
that
amulet
you
gave
me
something
very
there
was
that
said
robert
ah
i
don
t
mean
your
pretty
little
childish
mysteries
about
where
you
got
it
but
about
the
thing
itself
first
the
wonderful
dreams
i
used
to
have
after
you
d
shown
me
the
first
half
of
it
why
my
book
on
atlantis
that
i
did
was
the
beginning
of
my
fame
and
my
fortune
too
and
i
got
it
all
out
of
a
dream
and
then
britain
at
the
time
of
the
roman
invasion
that
was
only
a
pamphlet
but
it
explained
a
lot
of
things
people
hadn
t
yes
said
anthea
it
that
was
the
beginning
but
after
you
d
given
me
the
whole
of
the
amulet
ah
it
was
generous
of
you
then
somehow
i
didn
t
need
to
theorize
i
seemed
to
know
about
the
old
egyptian
civilization
and
they
can
t
upset
my
theories
he
rubbed
his
thin
hands
and
laughed
triumphantly
they
can
t
though
they
ve
tried
theories
they
call
them
but
they
re
more
like
i
don
t
know
more
like
memories
i
know
i
m
right
about
the
secret
rites
of
the
temple
of
i
m
so
glad
you
re
rich
said
anthea
you
weren
t
you
know
at
fitzroy
indeed
i
wasn
t
said
he
but
i
am
now
this
beautiful
house
and
this
lovely
garden
i
dig
in
it
sometimes
you
remember
you
used
to
tell
me
to
take
more
exercise
well
i
feel
i
owe
it
all
to
you
and
the
i
m
so
glad
said
anthea
and
kissed
him
he
started
that
didn
t
feel
like
a
dream
he
said
and
his
voice
trembled
it
isn
t
exactly
a
dream
said
anthea
softly
it
s
all
part
of
the
amulet
it
s
a
sort
of
extra
special
real
dream
dear
ah
said
he
when
you
call
me
that
i
know
i
m
dreaming
my
little
sister
i
dream
of
her
sometimes
but
it
s
not
real
like
this
do
you
remember
the
day
i
dreamed
you
brought
me
the
babylonish
ring
we
remember
it
all
said
robert
did
you
leave
fitzroy
street
because
you
were
too
rich
for
it
oh
no
he
said
reproachfully
you
know
i
should
never
have
done
such
a
thing
as
that
of
course
i
left
when
your
old
nurse
died
and
what
s
the
matter
old
nurse
dead
said
anthea
oh
no
yes
yes
it
s
the
common
lot
it
s
a
long
time
ago
jane
held
up
the
amulet
in
a
hand
that
twittered
come
she
cried
oh
come
home
she
may
be
dead
before
we
get
there
and
then
we
can
t
give
it
to
her
oh
come
ah
don
t
let
the
dream
end
now
pleaded
the
learned
gentleman
it
must
said
anthea
firmly
and
kissed
him
again
when
it
comes
to
people
dying
said
robert
i
m
so
glad
you
re
rich
and
famous
and
do
come
cried
jane
stamping
in
her
agony
of
impatience
and
they
went
old
nurse
brought
in
tea
almost
as
soon
as
they
were
back
in
fitzroy
street
as
she
came
in
with
the
tray
the
girls
rushed
at
her
and
nearly
upset
her
and
it
don
t
die
cried
jane
oh
don
t
and
anthea
cried
dear
ducky
darling
old
nurse
don
t
die
lord
love
you
said
nurse
i
m
not
agoin
to
die
yet
a
while
please
heaven
whatever
on
earth
s
the
matter
with
the
chicks
nothing
only
don
t
she
put
the
tray
down
and
hugged
the
girls
in
turn
the
boys
thumped
her
on
the
back
with
heartfelt
affection
i
m
as
well
as
ever
i
was
in
my
life
she
said
what
nonsense
about
dying
you
ve
been
a
sitting
too
long
in
the
dusk
that
s
what
it
is
regular
blind
man
s
holiday
leave
go
of
me
while
i
light
the
the
yellow
light
illuminated
four
pale
faces
we
do
love
you
so
anthea
went
on
and
we
ve
made
you
a
picture
to
show
you
how
we
love
you
get
it
out
the
glazed
testimonial
was
dragged
out
from
under
the
sofa
and
displayed
the
glue
s
not
dry
yet
said
cyril
look
out
what
a
beauty
cried
old
nurse
well
i
never
and
your
pictures
and
the
beautiful
writing
and
all
well
i
always
did
say
your
hearts
was
in
the
right
place
if
a
bit
careless
at
times
well
i
never
did
i
don
t
know
as
i
was
ever
pleased
better
in
my
she
hugged
them
all
one
after
the
other
and
the
boys
did
not
mind
it
somehow
that
day
how
is
it
we
can
remember
all
about
the
future
now
anthea
woke
the
psammead
with
laborious
gentleness
to
put
the
question
how
is
it
we
can
remember
what
we
saw
in
the
future
and
yet
when
we
were
in
the
future
we
could
not
remember
the
bit
of
the
future
that
was
past
then
the
time
of
finding
the
amulet
why
what
a
silly
question
said
the
psammead
of
course
you
can
not
remember
what
hasn
t
happened
but
the
future
hasn
t
happened
yet
anthea
persisted
and
we
remember
that
all
oh
that
isn
t
what
s
happened
my
good
child
said
the
psammead
rather
crossly
that
s
prophetic
vision
and
you
remember
dreams
don
t
you
so
why
not
visions
you
never
do
seem
to
understand
the
simplest
it
went
to
sand
again
at
once
anthea
crept
down
in
her
nightgown
to
give
one
last
kiss
to
old
nurse
and
one
last
look
at
the
beautiful
testimonial
hanging
by
its
tapes
its
glue
now
firmly
set
in
glazed
glory
on
the
wall
of
the
kitchen
bless
your
loving
heart
said
old
nurse
if
only
you
don
t
catch
your
chapter
the
shipwreck
on
the
tin
islands
blue
and
red
said
jane
softly
make
not
always
they
don
t
said
cyril
it
has
to
be
crimson
lake
and
prussian
blue
if
you
mix
vermilion
and
indigo
you
get
the
most
loathsome
slate
sepia
s
the
nastiest
colour
in
the
box
i
think
said
jane
sucking
her
brush
they
were
all
painting
nurse
in
the
flush
of
grateful
emotion
excited
by
robert
s
border
of
poppies
had
presented
each
of
the
four
with
a
shilling
and
had
supplemented
the
gift
with
a
pile
of
old
copies
of
the
illustrated
london
news
sepia
said
cyril
instructively
is
made
out
of
beastly
purple
s
made
out
of
a
fish
as
well
as
out
of
red
and
blue
said
robert
tyrian
purple
was
i
out
of
lobsters
said
jane
dreamily
they
re
red
when
they
re
boiled
and
blue
when
they
aren
t
if
you
mixed
live
and
dead
lobsters
you

get
tyrian
shouldn
t
like
to
mix
anything
with
a
live
lobster
said
anthea
shuddering
well
there

t
any
other
red
and
blue
fish
said
jane
you

i
d
rather

the
purple
said
anthea
the
tyrian
purple
wasn
t
that
colour
when
it
came
out
of
the
fish
nor
yet
afterwards
it
wasn
t
said
robert
it
was
scarlet
really
and
roman
emperors
wore
it
and
it
wasn
t
any
nice
colour
while
the
fish
had
it
it
was
a
liquid
of
a
creamy
how
do
you
know
asked
cyril
i
read
it
said
robert
with
the
meek
pride
of
superior
knowledge
where
asked
cyril
in
print
said
robert
still
more
proudly
meek
you
think
everything
s
true
if
it
s
printed
said
cyril
naturally
annoyed
but
it
isn
t
father
said
so
quite
a
lot
of
lies
get
printed
especially
in
you
see
as
it
happens
said
robert
in
what
was
really
a
rather
annoying
tone
it
wasn
t
a
newspaper
it
was
in
a
how
sweet
chinese
white
is
said
jane
dreamily
sucking
her
brush
again
i
don
t
believe
it
said
cyril
to
robert
have
a
suck
yourself
suggested
robert
i
don
t
mean
about
the
chinese
white
i
mean
about
the
cream
fish
turning
purple
and
oh
cried
anthea
jumping
up
very
quickly
i
m
tired
of
painting
let
s
go
somewhere
by
amulet
i
say
let
s
let
it
cyril
and
robert
agreed
that
this
was
an
idea
jane
consented
to
stop
painting
because
as
she
said
chinese
white
though
certainly
sweet
gives
you
a
queer
feeling
in
the
back
of
the
throat
if
you
paint
with
it
too
long
the
amulet
was
held
up
take
us
somewhere
said
jane
anywhere
you
like
in
the
past
but
somewhere
where
you
then
she
said
the
word
next
moment
everyone
felt
a
queer
rocking
and
swaying
something
like
what
you
feel
when
you
go
out
in
a
fishing
boat
and
that
was
not
wonderful
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
for
it
was
in
a
boat
that
they
found
themselves
a
queer
boat
with
high
bulwarks
pierced
with
holes
for
oars
to
go
through
there
was
a
high
seat
for
the
steersman
and
the
prow
was
shaped
like
the
head
of
some
great
animal
with
big
staring
eyes
the
boat
rode
at
anchor
in
a
bay
and
the
bay
was
very
smooth
the
crew
were
dark
wiry
fellows
with
black
beards
and
hair
they
had
no
clothes
except
a
tunic
from
waist
to
knee
and
round
caps
with
knobs
on
the
top
they
were
very
busy
and
what
they
were
doing
was
so
interesting
to
the
children
that
at
first
they
did
not
even
wonder
where
the
amulet
had
brought
them
and
the
crew
seemed
too
busy
to
notice
the
children
they
were
fastening
rush
baskets
to
a
long
rope
with
a
great
piece
of
cork
at
the
end
and
in
each
basket
they
put
mussels
or
little
frogs
then
they
cast
out
the
rope
the
baskets
sank
but
the
cork
floated
and
all
about
on
the
blue
water
were
other
boats
and
all
the
crews
of
all
the
boats
were
busy
with
ropes
and
baskets
and
frogs
and
mussels
whatever
are
you
doing
jane
suddenly
asked
a
man
who
had
rather
more
clothes
than
the
others
and
seemed
to
be
a
sort
of
captain
or
overseer
he
started
and
stared
at
her
but
he
had
seen
too
many
strange
lands
to
be
very
much
surprised
at
these
stowaways
setting
lines
for
the
dye
he
said
shortly
how
did
you
get
here
a
sort
of
magic
said
robert
carelessly
the
captain
fingered
an
amulet
that
hung
round
his
neck
what
is
this
place
asked
cyril
tyre
of
course
said
the
man
then
he
drew
back
and
spoke
in
a
low
voice
to
one
of
the
sailors
now
we
shall
know
about
your
precious
fish
said
cyril
but
we
never
said
come
to
tyre
said
jane
the
amulet
heard
us
talking
i
expect
i
think
it
s
most
obliging
of
it
said
anthea
and
the
amulet
s
here
too
said
robert
we
ought
to
be
able
to
find
it
in
a
little
ship
like
this
i
wonder
which
of
them
s
got
oh
look
look
cried
anthea
suddenly
on
the
bare
breast
of
one
of
the
sailors
gleamed
something
red
it
was
the
exact
counterpart
of
their
precious
a
silence
full
of
emotion
was
broken
by
jane
then
we
ve
found
it
she
said
oh
do
let
s
take
it
and
go
home
easy
to
say
take
it
said
cyril
he
looks
very
he
did
yet
not
so
strong
as
the
other
sailors
it
s
odd
said
anthea
musingly
i
do
believe
i
ve
seen
that
man
somewhere
he
s
rather
like
our
learned
gentleman
said
robert
but
i
ll
tell
you
who
he
s
much
more
like
at
that
moment
that
sailor
looked
up
his
eyes
met
robert
s
and
robert
and
the
others
had
no
longer
any
doubt
as
to
where
they
had
seen
him
before
it
was
the
priest
who
had
led
them
to
the
palace
of
pharaoh
and
whom
jane
had
looked
back
at
through
the
arch
when
he
was
counselling
pharaoh
s
guard
to
take
the
jewels
and
fly
for
his
life
nobody
was
quite
pleased
and
nobody
quite
knew
why
jane
voiced
the
feelings
of
all
when
she
said
fingering
their
amulet
through
the
folds
of
her
frock
we
can
go
back
in
a
minute
if
anything
nasty
for
the
moment
nothing
worse
happened
than
an
offer
of
food
figs
and
cucumbers
it
was
and
very
pleasant
i
see
said
the
captain
that
you
are
from
a
far
country
since
you
have
honoured
my
boat
by
appearing
on
it
you
must
stay
here
till
morning
then
i
will
lead
you
to
one
of
our
great
ones
he
loves
strangers
from
far
let
s
go
home
jane
whispered
all
the
frogs
are
drowning
now
i
think
the
people
here
are
but
the
boys
wanted
to
stay
and
see
the
lines
taken
up
in
the
morning
it
s
just
like
and
said
cyril
the
baskets
only
open
from
outside
i
vote
we
so
they
stayed
that
s
tyre
over
there
said
the
captain
who
was
evidently
trying
to
be
civil
he
pointed
to
a
great
island
rock
that
rose
steeply
from
the
sea
crowned
with
huge
walls
and
towers
there
was
another
city
on
the
mainland
that
s
part
of
tyre
too
said
the
captain
it
s
where
the
great
merchants
have
their
and
gardens
and
look
look
cyril
cried
suddenly
what
a
lovely
little
ship
a
ship
in
full
sail
was
passing
swiftly
through
the
fishing
fleet
the
captain
s
face
changed
he
frowned
and
his
eyes
blazed
with
fury
insolent
young
barbarian
he
cried
do
you
call
the
ships
of
tyre
little
none
greater
sail
the
seas
that
ship
has
been
on
a
three
years
voyage
she
is
known
in
all
the
great
trading
ports
from
here
to
the
tin
islands
she
comes
back
rich
and
glorious
her
very
anchor
is
of
i
m
sure
we
beg
your
pardon
said
anthea
hastily
in
our
country
we
say
little
for
a
pet
name
your
wife
might
call
you
her
dear
little
husband
you
i
should
like
to
catch
her
at
it
growled
the
captain
but
he
stopped
scowling
it
s
a
rich
trade
he
went
on
for
cloth
once
dipped
glass
and
the
rough
images
our
young
artists
carve
for
practice
the
barbarian
king
in
tessos
lets
us
work
the
silver
mines
we
get
so
much
silver
there
that
we
leave
them
our
iron
anchors
and
come
back
with
silver
how
splendid
said
robert
do
go
on
what
s
cloth
once
dipped
you
must
be
barbarians
from
the
outer
darkness
said
the
captain
scornfully
all
wealthy
nations
know
that
our
finest
stuffs
are
twice
dyed
dibaptha
they
re
only
for
the
robes
of
kings
and
priests
and
what
do
the
rich
merchants
wear
asked
jane
with
interest
in
the
they
wear
the
dibaptha
our
merchants
are
princes
scowled
the
skipper
oh
don
t
be
cross
we
do
so
like
hearing
about
things
we
want
to
know
all
about
the
dyeing
said
anthea
cordially
oh
you
do
do
you
growled
the
man
so
that
s
what
you
re
here
for
well
you
won
t
get
the
secrets
of
the
dye
trade
out
of
he
went
away
and
everyone
felt
snubbed
and
uncomfortable
and
all
the
time
the
long
narrow
eyes
of
the
egyptian
were
watching
watching
they
felt
as
though
he
was
watching
them
through
the
darkness
when
they
lay
down
to
sleep
on
a
pile
of
cloaks
next
morning
the
baskets
were
drawn
up
full
of
what
looked
like
whelk
shells
the
children
were
rather
in
the
way
but
they
made
themselves
as
small
as
they
could
while
the
skipper
was
at
the
other
end
of
the
boat
they
did
ask
one
question
of
a
sailor
whose
face
was
a
little
less
unkind
than
the
others
yes
he
answered
this
is
the
it
s
a
sort
of
murex
and
there
s
another
kind
that
they
catch
at
sidon
and
then
of
course
there
s
the
kind
that
s
used
for
the
dibaptha
but
that
s
quite
different
it
s
hold
your
tongue
shouted
the
skipper
and
the
man
held
it
the
laden
boat
was
rowed
slowly
round
the
end
of
the
island
and
was
made
fast
in
one
of
the
two
great
harbours
that
lay
inside
a
long
breakwater
the
harbour
was
full
of
all
sorts
of
ships
so
that
cyril
and
robert
enjoyed
themselves
much
more
than
their
sisters
the
breakwater
and
the
quays
were
heaped
with
bales
and
baskets
and
crowded
with
slaves
and
sailors
farther
along
some
men
were
practising
diving
that
s
jolly
good
said
robert
as
a
naked
brown
body
cleft
the
water
i
should
think
so
said
the
skipper
the
of
persia
are
not
more
skilful
why
we
ve
got
a
spring
that
comes
out
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
our
divers
dive
down
and
bring
up
the
fresh
water
in
skin
bottles
can
your
barbarian
divers
do
as
much
i
suppose
not
said
robert
and
put
away
a
wild
desire
to
explain
to
the
captain
the
english
system
of
waterworks
pipes
taps
and
the
intricacies
of
the
plumbers
trade
as
they
neared
the
quay
the
skipper
made
a
hasty
toilet
he
did
his
hair
combed
his
beard
put
on
a
garment
like
a
jersey
with
short
sleeves
an
embroidered
belt
a
necklace
of
beads
and
a
big
signet
ring
now
said
he
i
m
fit
to
be
seen
come
along
where
to
said
jane
cautiously
to
pheles
the
great
said
the
skipper
the
man
i
told
you
of
who
loves
then
came
forward
and
for
the
first
time
spoke
i
have
known
these
children
in
another
land
he
said
you
know
my
powers
of
magic
it
was
my
magic
that
brought
these
barbarians
to
your
boat
and
you
know
how
they
will
profit
you
i
read
your
thoughts
let
me
come
with
you
and
see
the
end
of
them
and
then
i
will
work
the
spell
i
promised
you
in
return
for
the
little
experience
you
have
so
kindly
given
me
on
your
the
skipper
looked
at
the
egyptian
with
some
disfavour
so
it
was
your
doing
he
said
i
might
have
guessed
it
well
come
so
he
came
and
the
girls
wished
he
hadn
t
but
robert
whispered
nonsense
as
long
as
he
s
with
us
we
ve
got
some
chance
of
the
amulet
we
can
always
fly
if
anything
goes
the
morning
was
so
fresh
and
bright
their
breakfast
had
been
so
good
and
so
unusual
they
had
actually
seen
the
amulet
round
the
egyptian
s
neck
one
or
two
or
all
these
things
suddenly
raised
the
children
s
spirits
they
went
off
quite
cheerfully
through
the
city
gate
it
was
not
arched
but
roofed
over
with
a
great
flat
stone
and
so
through
the
street
which
smelt
horribly
of
fish
and
garlic
and
a
thousand
other
things
even
less
agreeable
but
far
worse
than
the
street
scents
was
the
scent
of
the
factory
where
the
skipper
called
in
to
sell
his
night
s
catch
i
wish
i
could
tell
you
all
about
that
factory
but
i
haven
t
time
and
perhaps
after
all
you
aren
t
interested
in
dyeing
works
i
will
only
mention
that
robert
was
triumphantly
proved
to
be
right
the
dye
was
a
liquid
of
a
creamy
consistency
and
it
smelt
more
strongly
of
garlic
than
garlic
itself
does
while
the
skipper
was
bargaining
with
the
master
of
the
dye
works
the
egyptian
came
close
to
the
children
and
said
suddenly
and
softly
trust
i
wish
we
could
said
anthea
you
feel
said
the
egyptian
that
i
want
your
amulet
that
makes
you
distrust
yes
said
cyril
bluntly
but
you
also
you
want
my
amulet
and
i
am
trusting
there
s
something
in
that
said
robert
we
have
the
two
halves
of
the
amulet
said
the
priest
but
not
yet
the
pin
that
joined
them
our
only
chance
of
getting
that
is
to
remain
together
once
part
these
two
halves
and
they
may
never
be
found
in
the
same
time
and
place
be
wise
our
interests
are
the
before
anyone
could
say
more
the
skipper
came
back
and
with
him
the
his
hair
and
beard
were
curled
like
the
men
s
in
babylon
and
he
was
dressed
like
the
skipper
but
with
added
grandeur
of
gold
and
embroidery
he
had
necklaces
of
beads
and
silver
and
a
glass
amulet
with
a
man
s
face
very
like
his
own
set
between
two
bull
s
heads
as
well
as
gold
and
silver
bracelets
and
armlets
he
looked
keenly
at
the
children
then
he
said
my
brother
pheles
has
just
come
back
from
tarshish
he
s
at
his
garden
house
unless
he
s
hunting
wild
boar
in
the
marshes
he
gets
frightfully
bored
on
ah
said
the
skipper
he
s
a
phoenician
tyre
tyre
for
ever
oh
tyre
rules
the
waves
as
the
old
song
says
i
ll
go
at
once
and
show
him
my
young
i
should
said
the
they
are
very
rum
aren
t
they
what
frightful
clothes
and
what
a
lot
of
them
observe
the
covering
of
their
feet
hideous
robert
could
not
help
thinking
how
easy
and
at
the
same
time
pleasant
it
would
be
to
catch
hold
of
the
s
feet
and
tip
him
backward
into
the
great
sunken
vat
just
near
him
but
if
he
had
flight
would
have
had
to
be
the
next
move
so
he
restrained
his
impulse
there
was
something
about
this
tyrian
adventure
that
was
different
from
all
the
others
it
was
somehow
calmer
and
there
was
the
undoubted
fact
that
the
charm
was
there
on
the
neck
of
the
egyptian
so
they
enjoyed
everything
to
the
full
the
row
from
the
island
city
to
the
shore
the
ride
on
the
donkeys
that
the
skipper
hired
at
the
gate
of
the
mainland
city
and
the
pleasant
country
palms
and
figs
and
cedars
all
about
it
was
like
a
garden
clematis
honeysuckle
and
jasmine
clung
about
the
olive
and
mulberry
trees
and
there
were
tulips
and
gladiolus
and
clumps
of
mandrake
which
has
that
look
as
though
they
were
cut
out
of
dark
blue
jewels
in
the
distance
were
the
mountains
of
lebanon
the
house
they
came
to
at
last
was
rather
like
a
bungalow
long
and
low
with
pillars
all
along
the
front
cedars
and
sycamores
grew
near
it
and
sheltered
it
pleasantly
everyone
dismounted
and
the
donkeys
were
led
away
why
is
this
like
rosherville
whispered
robert
and
instantly
supplied
the
answer
because
it
s
the
place
to
spend
a
happy
it
s
jolly
decent
of
the
skipper
to
have
brought
us
to
such
a
ripping
place
said
cyril
do
you
know
said
anthea
this
feels
more
real
than
anything
else
we
ve
seen
it
s
like
a
holiday
in
the
country
at
the
children
were
left
alone
in
a
large
hall
the
floor
was
mosaic
done
with
wonderful
pictures
of
ships
and
and
fishes
through
an
open
doorway
they
could
see
a
pleasant
courtyard
with
flowers
i
should
like
to
spend
a
week
here
said
jane
and
donkey
ride
every
everyone
was
feeling
very
jolly
even
the
egyptian
looked
pleasanter
than
usual
and
then
quite
suddenly
the
skipper
came
back
with
a
joyous
smile
with
him
came
the
master
of
the
house
he
looked
steadily
at
the
children
and
nodded
twice
yes
he
said
my
steward
will
pay
you
the
price
but
i
shall
not
pay
at
that
high
rate
for
the
egyptian
the
two
passed
on
this
said
the
egyptian
is
a
pretty
kettle
of
what
is
asked
all
the
children
at
once
our
present
position
said
our
seafaring
friend
he
added
has
sold
us
all
for
slaves
a
hasty
council
succeeded
the
shock
of
this
announcement
the
priest
was
allowed
to
take
part
in
it
his
advice
was
stay
because
they
were
in
no
danger
and
the
amulet
in
its
completeness
must
be
somewhere
near
or
of
course
they
could
not
have
come
to
that
place
at
all
and
after
some
discussion
they
agreed
to
this
the
children
were
treated
more
as
guests
than
as
slaves
but
the
egyptian
was
sent
to
the
kitchen
and
made
to
work
pheles
the
master
of
the
house
went
off
that
very
evening
by
the
king
s
orders
to
start
on
another
voyage
and
when
he
was
gone
his
wife
found
the
children
amusing
company
and
kept
them
talking
and
singing
and
dancing
till
quite
late
to
distract
my
mind
from
my
sorrows
she
said
i
do
like
being
a
slave
remarked
jane
cheerfully
as
they
curled
up
on
the
big
soft
cushions
that
were
to
be
their
beds
it
was
black
night
when
they
were
awakened
each
by
a
hand
passed
softly
over
its
face
and
a
low
voice
that
whispered
be
quiet
or
all
is
so
they
were
quiet
it
s
me
the
priest
of
amen
said
the
whisperer
the
man
who
brought
us
has
gone
to
sea
again
and
he
has
taken
my
amulet
from
me
by
force
and
i
know
no
magic
to
get
it
back
is
there
magic
for
that
in
the
amulet
you
bear
everyone
was
instantly
awake
by
now
we
can
go
after
him
said
cyril
leaping
up
but
he
might
take
ours
as
well
or
he
might
be
angry
with
us
for
following
i
ll
see
to
that
said
the
egyptian
in
the
dark
hide
your
amulet
there
in
the
deep
blackness
of
that
room
in
the
tyrian
country
house
the
amulet
was
once
more
held
up
and
the
word
spoken
all
passed
through
on
to
a
ship
that
tossed
and
tumbled
on
a
sea
they
crouched
together
there
till
morning
and
jane
and
cyril
were
not
at
all
well
when
the
dawn
showed
across
the
steely
waves
they
stood
up
as
well
as
they
could
for
the
tumbling
of
the
ship
pheles
that
hardy
sailor
and
adventurer
turned
quite
pale
when
he
turned
round
suddenly
and
saw
them
well
he
said
well
i
never
did
master
said
the
egyptian
bowing
low
and
that
was
even
more
difficult
than
standing
up
we
are
here
by
the
magic
of
the
sacred
amulet
that
hangs
round
your
i
never
did
repeated
pheles
well
well
what
port
is
the
ship
bound
for
asked
robert
with
a
nautical
air
but
pheles
said
are
you
a
navigator
robert
had
to
own
that
he
was
not
then
said
pheles
i
don
t
mind
telling
you
that
we
re
bound
for
the
tin
isles
tyre
alone
knows
where
the
tin
isles
are
it
is
a
splendid
secret
we
keep
from
all
the
world
it
is
as
great
a
thing
to
us
as
your
magic
to
he
spoke
in
quite
a
new
voice
and
seemed
to
respect
both
the
children
and
the
amulet
a
good
deal
more
than
he
had
done
before
the
king
sent
you
didn
t
he
said
jane
yes
answered
pheles
he
bade
me
set
sail
with
half
a
score
brave
gentlemen
and
this
crew
you
shall
go
with
us
and
see
many
he
bowed
and
left
them
what
are
we
going
to
do
now
said
robert
when
pheles
had
caused
them
to
be
left
along
with
a
breakfast
of
dried
fruits
and
a
sort
of
hard
biscuit
wait
till
he
lands
in
the
tin
isles
said
then
we
can
get
the
barbarians
to
help
us
we
will
attack
him
by
night
and
tear
the
sacred
amulet
from
his
accursed
heathen
neck
he
added
grinding
his
teeth
when
shall
we
get
to
the
tin
isles
asked
jane
oh
six
months
perhaps
or
a
year
said
the
egyptian
cheerfully
a
year
of
this
cried
jane
and
cyril
who
was
still
feeling
far
too
unwell
to
care
about
breakfast
hugged
himself
miserably
and
shuddered
it
was
robert
who
said
look
here
we
can
shorten
that
year
jane
out
with
the
amulet
wish
that
we
were
where
the
amulet
will
be
when
the
ship
is
twenty
miles
from
the
tin
island
that
ll
give
us
time
to
mature
our
it
was
done
the
work
of
a
moment
and
there
they
were
on
the
same
ship
between
grey
northern
sky
and
grey
northern
sea
the
sun
was
setting
in
a
pale
yellow
line
it
was
the
same
ship
but
it
was
changed
and
so
were
the
crew
and
dirty
were
the
sailors
and
their
clothes
torn
and
ragged
and
the
children
saw
that
of
course
though
they
had
skipped
the
nine
months
the
ship
had
had
to
live
through
them
pheles
looked
thinner
and
his
face
was
rugged
and
anxious
ha
he
cried
the
charm
has
brought
you
back
i
have
prayed
to
it
daily
these
nine
months
and
now
you
are
here
have
you
no
magic
that
can
help
what
is
your
need
asked
the
egyptian
quietly
i
need
a
great
wave
that
shall
whelm
away
the
foreign
ship
that
follows
us
a
month
ago
it
lay
in
wait
for
us
by
the
pillars
of
the
gods
and
it
follows
follows
to
find
out
the
secret
of
tyre
the
place
of
the
tin
islands
if
i
could
steer
by
night
i
could
escape
them
yet
but
tonight
there
will
be
no
my
magic
will
not
serve
you
here
said
the
egyptian
but
robert
said
my
magic
will
not
bring
up
great
waves
but
i
can
show
you
how
to
steer
without
he
took
out
the
shilling
compass
still
fortunately
in
working
order
that
he
had
bought
off
another
boy
at
school
for
fivepence
a
piece
of
indiarubber
a
strip
of
whalebone
and
half
a
stick
of
red
and
he
showed
pheles
how
it
worked
and
pheles
wondered
at
the
compass
s
magic
truth
i
will
give
it
to
you
robert
said
in
return
for
that
charm
about
your
pheles
made
no
answer
he
first
laughed
snatched
the
compass
from
robert
s
hand
and
turned
away
still
laughing
be
comforted
the
priest
whispered
our
time
will
the
dusk
deepened
and
pheles
crouched
beside
a
dim
lantern
steered
by
the
shilling
compass
from
the
crystal
palace
no
one
ever
knew
how
the
other
ship
sailed
but
suddenly
in
the
deep
night
the
man
at
the
stern
cried
out
in
a
terrible
voice
she
is
close
upon
us
and
we
said
pheles
are
close
to
the
he
was
silent
a
moment
then
suddenly
he
altered
the
ship
s
course
and
then
he
stood
up
and
spoke
good
friends
and
gentlemen
he
said
who
are
bound
with
me
in
this
brave
venture
by
our
king
s
command
the
false
foreign
ship
is
close
on
our
heels
if
we
land
they
land
and
only
the
gods
know
whether
they
might
not
beat
us
in
fight
and
themselves
survive
to
carry
back
the
tale
of
tyre
s
secret
island
to
enrich
their
own
miserable
land
shall
this
be
never
cried
the
men
near
him
the
slaves
were
rowing
hard
below
and
could
not
hear
his
words
the
egyptian
leaped
upon
him
suddenly
fiercely
as
a
wild
beast
leaps
give
me
back
my
amulet
he
cried
and
caught
at
the
charm
the
chain
that
held
it
snapped
and
it
lay
in
the
priest
s
hand
pheles
laughed
standing
balanced
to
the
leap
of
the
ship
that
answered
the
oarstroke
this
is
no
time
for
charms
and
mummeries
he
said
we
ve
lived
like
men
and
we
ll
die
like
gentlemen
for
the
honour
and
glory
of
tyre
our
splendid
city
tyre
tyre
for
ever
it
s
tyre
that
rules
the
i
steer
her
straight
for
the
dragon
rocks
and
we
go
down
for
our
city
as
brave
men
should
the
creeping
cowards
who
follow
shall
go
down
as
slaves
and
slaves
they
shall
be
to
us
when
we
live
again
tyre
tyre
for
ever
a
great
shout
went
up
and
the
slaves
below
joined
in
it
quick
the
amulet
cried
anthea
and
held
it
up
held
up
the
one
he
had
snatched
from
pheles
the
word
was
spoken
and
the
two
great
arches
grew
on
the
plunging
ship
in
the
shrieking
wind
under
the
dark
sky
from
each
amulet
a
great
and
beautiful
green
light
streamed
and
shone
far
out
over
the
waves
it
illuminated
too
the
black
faces
and
jagged
teeth
of
the
great
rocks
that
lay
not
two
ships
lengths
from
the
boat
s
peaked
nose
tyre
tyre
for
ever
it
s
tyre
that
rules
the
waves
the
voices
of
the
doomed
rose
in
a
triumphant
shout
the
children
scrambled
through
the
arch
and
stood
trembling
and
blinking
in
the
fitzroy
street
parlour
and
in
their
ears
still
sounded
the
whistle
of
the
wind
and
the
rattle
of
the
oars
the
crash
of
the
ships
bow
on
the
rocks
and
the
last
shout
of
the
brave
who
went
to
their
deaths
singing
for
the
sake
of
the
city
they
loved
and
so
we
ve
lost
the
other
half
of
the
amulet
again
said
anthea
when
they
had
told
the
psammead
all
about
it
nonsense
pooh
said
the
psammead
that
wasn
t
the
other
half
it
was
the
same
half
that
you
ve
got
the
one
that
wasn
t
crushed
and
but
how
could
it
be
the
same
said
anthea
gently
well
not
exactly
of
course
the
one
you
ve
got
is
a
good
many
years
older
but
at
any
rate
it
s
not
the
other
one
what
did
you
say
when
you
wished
i
forget
said
jane
i
don
t
said
the
psammead
you
said
take
us
where
you
are
and
it
did
so
you
see
it
was
the
same
i
see
said
anthea
but
you
mark
my
words
the
psammead
went
on
you
ll
have
trouble
with
that
priest
why
he
was
quite
friendly
said
anthea
all
the
same
you
d
better
beware
of
the
reverend
oh
i
m
sick
of
the
amulet
said
cyril
we
shall
never
get
oh
yes
we
shall
said
robert
don
t
you
remember
december
jinks
said
cyril
i
d
forgotten
i
don
t
believe
it
said
jane
and
i
don
t
feel
at
all
if
i
were
you
said
the
psammead
i
should
not
go
out
into
the
past
again
till
that
date
you
ll
find
it
safer
not
to
go
where
you
re
likely
to
meet
that
egyptian
any
more
just
at
of
course
we
ll
do
as
you
say
said
anthea
soothingly
though
there
s
something
about
his
face
that
i
really
do
still
you
don
t
want
to
run
after
him
i
suppose
snapped
the
psammead
you
wait
till
the
and
then
see
what
cyril
and
jane
were
feeling
far
from
well
anthea
was
always
obliging
so
robert
was
overruled
and
they
promised
and
none
of
them
not
even
the
psammead
at
all
foresaw
as
you
no
doubt
do
quite
plainly
exactly
what
it
was
that
would
happen
on
that
memorable
date
chapter
the
heart
s
desire
if
i
only
had
time
i
could
tell
you
lots
of
things
for
instance
how
in
spite
of
the
advice
of
the
psammead
the
four
children
did
one
very
wet
day
go
through
their
amulet
arch
into
the
golden
desert
and
there
find
the
great
temple
of
baalbec
and
meet
with
the
phoenix
whom
they
never
thought
to
see
again
and
how
the
phoenix
did
not
remember
them
at
all
until
it
went
into
a
sort
of
prophetic
trance
if
that
can
be
called
remembering
but
alas
i
haven
t
time
so
i
must
leave
all
that
out
though
it
was
a
wonderfully
thrilling
adventure
i
must
leave
out
too
all
about
the
visit
of
the
children
to
the
hippodrome
with
the
psammead
in
its
travelling
bag
and
about
how
the
wishes
of
the
people
round
about
them
were
granted
so
suddenly
and
surprisingly
that
at
last
the
psammead
had
to
be
taken
hurriedly
home
by
anthea
who
consequently
missed
half
the
performance
then
there
was
the
time
when
nurse
having
gone
to
tea
with
a
friend
out
ivalunk
way
they
were
playing
devil
in
the
dark
and
in
the
midst
of
that
most
creepy
pastime
the
postman
s
knock
frightened
jane
nearly
out
of
her
life
she
took
in
the
letters
however
and
put
them
in
the
back
of
the
drawer
so
that
they
should
be
safe
and
safe
they
were
for
she
never
thought
of
them
again
for
weeks
and
weeks
one
really
good
thing
happened
when
they
took
the
psammead
to
a
show
and
lecture
at
the
boys
school
at
camden
town
the
lecture
was
all
about
our
soldiers
in
south
africa
and
the
lecturer
ended
up
by
saying
and
i
hope
every
boy
in
this
room
has
in
his
heart
the
seeds
of
courage
and
heroism
and
and
i
wish
that
every
one
of
you
may
grow
up
to
be
noble
and
brave
and
unselfish
worthy
citizens
of
this
great
empire
for
whom
our
soldiers
have
freely
given
their
and
of
course
this
came
true
which
was
a
distinct
score
for
camden
town
as
anthea
said
it
was
unlucky
that
the
lecturer
said
boys
because
now
she
and
jane
would
have
to
be
noble
and
unselfish
if
at
all
without
any
outside
help
but
jane
said
i
daresay
we
are
already
because
of
our
beautiful
natures
it
s
only
boys
that
have
to
be
made
brave
by
magic
which
nearly
led
to
a
row
and
i
daresay
you
would
like
to
know
all
about
the
affair
of
the
fishing
rod
and
the
and
the
cook
next
door
which
was
amusing
from
some
points
of
view
though
not
perhaps
the
cook
s
but
there
really
is
no
time
even
for
that
the
only
thing
that
there
s
time
to
tell
about
is
the
adventure
of
maskelyne
and
cooke
s
and
the
unexpected
apparition
which
is
also
the
beginning
of
the
end
it
was
nurse
who
broke
into
the
gloomy
music
of
the
autumn
rain
on
the
window
panes
by
suggesting
a
visit
to
the
egyptian
hall
england
s
home
of
mystery
though
they
had
good
but
private
reasons
to
know
that
their
own
particular
personal
mystery
was
of
a
very
different
brand
the
four
all
brightened
at
the
idea
all
children
as
well
as
a
good
many
love
conjuring
it
s
in
piccadilly
said
old
nurse
carefully
counting
out
the
proper
number
of
shillings
into
cyril
s
hand
not
so
very
far
down
on
the
left
from
the
circus
there
s
big
pillars
outside
something
like
carter
s
seed
place
in
holborn
as
used
to
be
day
and
martin
s
blacking
when
i
was
a
gell
and
something
like
euston
station
only
not
so
yes
i
know
said
everybody
so
they
started
but
though
they
walked
along
the
side
of
piccadilly
they
saw
no
pillared
building
that
was
at
all
like
carter
s
seed
warehouse
or
euston
station
or
england
s
home
of
mystery
as
they
remembered
it
at
last
they
stopped
a
hurried
lady
and
asked
her
the
way
to
maskelyne
and
cooke
s
i
don
t
know
i
m
sure
she
said
pushing
past
them
i
always
shop
at
the
which
just
shows
as
jane
said
how
ignorant
people
are
it
was
a
policeman
who
at
last
explained
to
them
that
england
s
mysteries
are
now
appropriately
enough
enacted
at
st
george
s
hall
so
they
tramped
to
langham
place
and
missed
the
first
two
items
in
the
programme
but
they
were
in
time
for
the
most
wonderful
magic
appearances
and
disappearances
which
they
could
hardly
believe
even
with
all
their
knowledge
of
a
larger
magic
was
not
really
magic
after
all
if
only
the
babylonians
could
have
seen
this
conjuring
whispered
cyril
it
takes
the
shine
out
of
their
old
conjurer
doesn
t
it
hush
said
anthea
and
several
other
members
of
the
audience
now
there
was
a
vacant
seat
next
to
robert
and
it
was
when
all
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
stage
where
mr
devant
was
pouring
out
glasses
of
all
sorts
of
different
things
to
drink
out
of
one
kettle
with
one
spout
and
the
audience
were
delightedly
tasting
them
that
robert
felt
someone
in
that
vacant
seat
he
did
not
feel
someone
sit
down
in
it
it
was
just
that
one
moment
there
was
no
one
sitting
there
and
the
next
moment
suddenly
there
was
someone
robert
turned
the
someone
who
had
suddenly
filled
that
empty
place
was
the
priest
of
amen
though
the
eyes
of
the
audience
were
fixed
on
mr
david
devant
mr
david
devant
s
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
audience
and
it
happened
that
his
eyes
were
more
particularly
fixed
on
that
empty
chair
so
that
he
saw
quite
plainly
the
sudden
appearance
from
nowhere
of
the
egyptian
priest
a
jolly
good
trick
he
said
to
himself
and
worked
under
my
own
eyes
in
my
own
hall
i
ll
find
out
how
that
s
he
had
never
seen
a
trick
that
he
could
not
do
himself
if
he
tried
by
this
time
a
good
many
eyes
in
the
audience
had
turned
on
the
figure
of
the
egyptian
priest
ladies
and
gentlemen
said
mr
devant
rising
to
the
occasion
this
is
a
trick
i
have
never
before
performed
the
empty
seat
third
from
the
end
second
row
gallery
you
will
now
find
occupied
by
an
ancient
egyptian
warranted
he
little
knew
how
true
his
words
were
and
now
all
eyes
were
turned
on
the
priest
and
the
children
and
the
whole
audience
after
a
moment
s
breathless
surprise
shouted
applause
only
the
lady
on
the
other
side
of
drew
back
a
little
she
knew
no
one
had
passed
her
and
as
she
said
later
over
tea
and
cold
tongue
it
was
that
sudden
it
made
her
flesh
seemed
very
much
annoyed
at
the
notice
he
was
exciting
come
out
of
this
crowd
he
whispered
to
robert
i
must
talk
with
you
oh
no
jane
whispered
i
did
so
want
to
see
the
mascot
moth
and
the
how
did
you
get
here
was
robert
s
return
whisper
how
did
you
get
to
egypt
and
to
tyre
retorted
come
let
us
leave
this
there
s
no
help
for
it
i
suppose
robert
shrugged
angrily
but
they
all
got
up
confederates
said
a
man
in
the
row
behind
now
they
go
round
to
the
back
and
take
part
in
the
next
i
wish
we
did
said
robert
confederate
yourself
said
cyril
and
so
they
got
away
the
audience
applauding
to
the
last
in
the
vestibule
of
st
george
s
hall
they
disguised
as
well
as
they
could
but
even
with
robert
s
hat
and
cyril
s
inverness
cape
he
was
too
striking
a
figure
for
in
the
london
streets
it
had
to
be
a
cab
and
it
took
the
last
least
money
of
all
of
them
they
stopped
the
cab
a
few
doors
from
home
and
then
the
girls
went
in
and
engaged
old
nurse
s
attention
by
an
account
of
the
conjuring
and
a
fervent
entreaty
for
with
their
tea
leaving
the
front
door
open
so
that
while
nurse
was
talking
to
them
the
boys
could
creep
quietly
in
with
and
smuggle
him
unseen
up
the
stairs
into
their
bedroom
when
the
girls
came
up
they
found
the
egyptian
priest
sitting
on
the
side
of
cyril
s
bed
his
hands
on
his
knees
looking
like
a
statue
of
a
king
come
on
said
cyril
impatiently
he
won
t
begin
till
we
re
all
here
and
shut
the
door
can
t
you
when
the
door
was
shut
the
egyptian
said
my
interests
and
yours
are
very
interesting
said
cyril
and
it
ll
be
a
jolly
sight
more
interesting
if
you
keep
following
us
about
in
a
decent
country
with
no
more
clothes
on
than
that
peace
said
the
priest
what
is
this
country
and
what
is
this
time
the
country
s
england
said
anthea
and
the
time
s
about
years
later
than
your
the
amulet
then
said
the
priest
deeply
thoughtful
gives
the
power
to
move
to
and
fro
in
time
as
well
as
in
space
that
s
about
it
said
cyril
gruffly
look
here
it
ll
be
directly
what
are
we
to
do
with
you
you
have
of
the
amulet
i
the
other
said
all
that
is
now
needed
is
the
pin
to
join
don
t
you
think
it
said
robert
the
half
you
ve
got
is
the
same
half
as
the
one
we
ve
but
the
same
thing
can
not
be
in
the
same
place
and
the
same
time
and
yet
be
not
one
but
twain
said
the
priest
see
here
is
my
he
laid
it
on
the
marcella
counterpane
where
is
yours
jane
watching
the
eyes
of
the
others
unfastened
the
string
of
the
amulet
and
laid
it
on
the
bed
but
too
far
off
for
the
priest
to
seize
it
even
if
he
had
been
so
dishonourable
cyril
and
robert
stood
beside
him
ready
to
spring
on
him
if
one
of
his
hands
had
moved
but
ever
so
little
towards
the
magic
treasure
that
was
theirs
but
his
hands
did
not
move
only
his
eyes
opened
very
wide
and
so
did
everyone
else
s
for
the
amulet
the
priest
had
now
quivered
and
shook
and
then
as
steel
is
drawn
to
the
magnet
it
was
drawn
across
the
white
counterpane
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
amulet
warm
from
the
neck
of
jane
and
then
as
one
drop
of
water
mingles
with
another
on
a
as
one
bead
of
is
drawn
into
another
bead
s
amulet
slipped
into
the
other
one
and
behold
there
was
no
more
but
the
one
amulet
black
magic
cried
and
sprang
forward
to
snatch
the
amulet
that
had
swallowed
his
but
anthea
caught
it
up
and
at
the
same
moment
the
priest
was
jerked
back
by
a
rope
thrown
over
his
head
it
drew
tightened
with
the
pull
of
his
forward
leap
and
bound
his
elbows
to
his
sides
before
he
had
time
to
use
his
strength
to
free
himself
robert
had
knotted
the
cord
behind
him
and
tied
it
to
the
bedpost
then
the
four
children
overcoming
the
priest
s
wrigglings
and
kickings
tied
his
legs
with
more
rope
i
thought
said
robert
breathing
hard
and
drawing
the
last
knot
tight
he
d
have
a
try
for
ours
so
i
got
the
ropes
out
of
the
so
as
to
be
the
girls
with
rather
white
faces
applauded
his
foresight
loosen
these
bonds
cried
in
fury
before
i
blast
you
with
the
seven
secret
curses
of
we
shouldn
t
be
likely
to
loose
them
after
robert
retorted
oh
don
t
quarrel
said
anthea
desperately
look
here
he
has
just
as
much
right
to
the
thing
as
we
have
this
she
took
up
the
amulet
that
had
swallowed
the
other
one
this
has
got
his
in
it
as
well
as
being
ours
let
s
go
let
me
go
cried
the
priest
writhing
now
look
here
said
robert
if
you
make
a
row
we
can
just
open
that
window
and
call
the
police
the
guards
you
know
and
tell
them
you
ve
been
trying
to
rob
us
now
will
you
shut
up
and
listen
to
reason
i
suppose
so
said
sulkily
but
reason
could
not
be
spoken
to
him
till
a
whispered
counsel
had
been
held
in
the
far
corner
by
the
and
the
a
counsel
rather
long
and
very
earnest
at
last
anthea
detached
herself
from
the
group
and
went
back
to
the
priest
look
here
she
said
in
her
kind
little
voice
we
want
to
be
friends
we
want
to
help
you
let
s
make
a
treaty
let
s
join
together
to
get
the
amulet
the
whole
one
i
mean
and
then
it
shall
belong
to
you
as
much
as
to
us
and
we
shall
all
get
our
hearts
fair
words
said
the
priest
grow
no
we
say
butter
no
parsnips
jane
put
in
but
don
t
you
see
we
want
to
be
fair
only
we
want
to
bind
you
in
the
chains
of
honour
and
upright
will
you
deal
fairly
by
us
said
robert
i
will
said
the
priest
by
the
sacred
secret
name
that
is
written
under
the
altar
of
i
will
deal
fairly
by
you
will
you
too
take
the
oath
of
honourable
partnership
no
said
anthea
on
the
instant
and
added
rather
rashly
we
don
t
swear
in
england
except
in
police
courts
where
the
guards
are
you
know
and
you
don
t
want
to
go
there
but
when
we
say
we
ll
do
a
thing
it
s
the
same
as
an
oath
to
us
we
do
it
you
trust
us
and
we
ll
trust
she
began
to
unbind
his
legs
and
the
boys
hastened
to
untie
his
arms
when
he
was
free
he
stood
up
stretched
his
arms
and
laughed
now
he
said
i
am
stronger
than
you
and
my
oath
is
void
i
have
sworn
by
nothing
and
my
oath
is
nothing
likewise
for
there
is
no
secret
sacred
name
under
the
altar
of
oh
yes
there
is
said
a
voice
from
under
the
bed
everyone
started
most
of
all
cyril
stooped
and
pulled
out
the
bath
of
sand
where
the
psammead
slept
you
don
t
know
everything
though
you
are
a
divine
father
of
the
temple
of
amen
said
the
psammead
shaking
itself
till
the
sand
fell
tinkling
on
the
bath
edge
there
is
a
secret
sacred
name
beneath
the
altar
of
shall
i
call
on
that
name
no
no
cried
the
priest
in
terror
no
said
jane
too
don
t
let
s
have
any
calling
besides
said
who
had
turned
very
white
indeed
under
his
natural
brownness
i
was
only
going
to
say
that
though
there
isn
t
any
name
under
there
is
said
the
psammead
threateningly
well
even
if
there
wasn
t
i
will
be
bound
by
the
wordless
oath
of
your
strangely
upright
land
and
having
said
that
i
will
be
your
friend
i
will
be
then
that
s
all
right
said
the
psammead
and
there
s
the
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
your
distinguished
partner
he
can
t
go
down
to
tea
like
that
you
you
see
we
can
t
do
anything
till
the
of
december
said
anthea
that
s
when
we
are
to
find
the
whole
charm
what
can
we
do
with
till
then
said
cyril
briefly
and
smuggle
up
his
meals
it
will
be
rather
like
a
fleeing
cavalier
concealed
from
exasperated
roundheads
said
robert
so
was
taken
up
to
the
and
made
as
comfortable
as
possible
in
a
snug
nook
between
an
old
nursery
fender
and
the
wreck
of
a
big
they
gave
him
a
big
to
sit
on
and
an
old
fur
coat
off
the
nail
on
the
door
to
keep
him
warm
and
when
they
had
had
their
own
tea
they
took
him
some
he
did
not
like
the
tea
at
all
but
he
liked
the
bread
and
butter
and
cake
that
went
with
it
they
took
it
in
turns
to
sit
with
him
during
the
evening
and
left
him
fairly
happy
and
quite
settled
for
the
night
but
when
they
went
up
in
the
morning
with
a
kipper
a
quarter
of
which
each
of
them
had
gone
without
at
breakfast
was
gone
there
was
the
cosy
corner
with
the
and
the
fur
coat
but
the
cosy
corner
was
empty
good
riddance
was
naturally
the
first
delightful
thought
in
each
mind
the
second
was
less
pleasing
because
everyone
at
once
remembered
that
since
his
amulet
had
been
swallowed
up
by
theirs
which
hung
once
more
round
the
neck
of
jane
he
could
have
no
possible
means
of
returning
to
his
egyptian
past
therefore
he
must
be
still
in
england
and
probably
somewhere
quite
near
them
plotting
mischief
the
attic
was
searched
to
prevent
mistakes
but
quite
vainly
the
best
thing
we
can
do
said
cyril
is
to
go
through
the
half
amulet
straight
away
get
the
whole
amulet
and
come
i
don
t
know
anthea
hesitated
would
that
be
quite
fair
perhaps
he
isn
t
really
a
base
deceiver
perhaps
something
s
happened
to
happened
said
cyril
not
it
besides
what
could
happen
i
don
t
know
said
anthea
perhaps
burglars
came
in
the
night
and
accidentally
killed
him
and
took
away
the
all
that
was
mortal
of
him
you
know
to
avoid
or
perhaps
said
cyril
they
hid
the
all
that
was
mortal
in
one
of
those
big
trunks
in
the
shall
we
go
back
and
look
he
added
grimly
no
no
jane
shuddered
let
s
go
and
tell
the
psammead
and
see
what
it
no
said
anthea
let
s
ask
the
learned
gentleman
if
anything
has
happened
to
a
gentleman
s
advice
would
be
more
useful
than
a
psammead
s
and
the
learned
gentleman
ll
only
think
it
s
a
dream
like
he
always
they
tapped
at
the
door
and
on
the
come
in
entered
the
learned
gentleman
was
sitting
in
front
of
his
untasted
breakfast
opposite
him
in
the
easy
chair
sat
hush
said
the
learned
gentleman
very
earnestly
please
hush
or
the
dream
will
go
i
am
learning
oh
what
have
i
not
learned
in
the
last
hour
in
the
grey
dawn
said
the
priest
i
left
my
and
finding
myself
among
these
treasures
from
my
own
country
i
remained
i
feel
more
at
home
here
of
course
i
know
it
s
a
dream
said
the
learned
gentleman
feverishly
but
oh
ye
gods
what
a
dream
by
jove
call
not
upon
the
gods
said
the
priest
lest
ye
raise
greater
ones
than
ye
can
control
already
he
explained
to
the
children
he
and
i
are
as
brothers
and
his
welfare
is
dear
to
me
as
my
he
has
told
me
the
learned
gentleman
began
but
robert
interrupted
this
was
no
moment
for
manners
have
you
told
him
he
asked
the
priest
all
about
the
amulet
no
said
then
tell
him
now
he
is
very
learned
perhaps
he
can
tell
us
what
to
hesitated
then
told
and
oddly
enough
none
of
the
children
ever
could
remember
afterwards
what
it
was
that
he
did
tell
perhaps
he
used
some
magic
to
prevent
their
remembering
when
he
had
done
the
learned
gentleman
was
silent
leaning
his
elbow
on
the
table
and
his
head
on
his
hand
dear
jimmy
said
anthea
gently
don
t
worry
about
it
we
are
sure
to
find
it
today
yes
said
and
perhaps
with
it
it
s
to
bring
us
our
hearts
desire
said
robert
who
knows
said
the
priest
what
things
and
infinitely
desirable
lie
beyond
the
dark
gates
oh
don
t
said
jane
almost
whimpering
the
learned
gentleman
raised
his
head
suddenly
why
not
he
suggested
go
back
into
the
past
at
a
moment
when
the
amulet
is
unwatched
wish
to
be
with
it
and
that
it
shall
be
under
your
it
was
the
simplest
thing
in
the
world
and
yet
none
of
them
had
ever
thought
of
it
come
cried
leaping
up
come
now
may
may
i
come
the
learned
gentleman
timidly
asked
it
s
only
a
dream
you
come
and
welcome
oh
brother
was
beginning
but
cyril
and
robert
with
one
voice
cried
you
weren
t
with
us
in
atlantis
robert
added
or
you
d
know
better
than
to
let
him
dear
jimmy
said
anthea
please
don
t
ask
to
come
we
ll
go
and
be
back
again
before
you
have
time
to
know
that
we
re
and
he
too
we
must
keep
together
said
since
there
is
but
one
perfect
amulet
to
which
i
and
these
children
have
equal
jane
held
up
the
amulet
went
first
and
they
all
passed
through
the
great
arch
into
which
the
amulet
grew
at
the
name
of
power
the
learned
gentleman
saw
through
the
arch
a
darkness
lighted
by
smoky
gleams
he
rubbed
his
eyes
and
he
only
rubbed
them
for
ten
seconds
the
children
and
the
priest
were
in
a
small
dark
chamber
a
square
doorway
of
massive
stone
let
in
gleams
of
shifting
light
and
the
sound
of
many
voices
chanting
a
slow
strange
hymn
they
stood
listening
now
and
then
the
chant
quickened
and
the
light
grew
brighter
as
though
fuel
had
been
thrown
on
a
fire
where
are
we
whispered
anthea
and
when
whispered
robert
this
is
some
shrine
near
the
beginnings
of
belief
said
the
egyptian
shivering
take
the
amulet
and
come
away
it
is
cold
here
in
the
morning
of
the
and
then
jane
felt
that
her
hand
was
on
a
slab
or
table
of
stone
and
under
her
hand
something
that
felt
like
the
charm
that
had
so
long
hung
round
her
neck
only
it
was
thicker
twice
as
thick
it
s
here
she
said
i
ve
got
it
and
she
hardly
knew
the
sound
of
her
own
voice
come
away
repeated
i
wish
we
could
see
more
of
this
temple
said
robert
resistingly
come
away
the
priest
urged
there
is
death
all
about
and
strong
magic
the
chanting
voices
seemed
to
have
grown
louder
and
fiercer
and
light
stronger
they
are
coming
cried
quick
quick
the
amulet
jane
held
it
up
what
a
long
time
you
ve
been
rubbing
your
eyes
said
anthea
don
t
you
see
we
ve
got
back
the
learned
gentleman
merely
stared
at
her
miss
anthea
miss
jane
it
was
nurse
s
voice
very
much
higher
and
squeaky
and
more
exalted
than
usual
oh
bother
said
everyone
cyril
adding
you
just
go
on
with
the
dream
for
a
sec
mr
jimmy
we
ll
be
back
directly
nurse
ll
come
up
if
we
don
t
she
wouldn
t
think
was
a
then
they
went
down
nurse
was
in
the
hall
an
orange
envelope
in
one
hand
and
a
pink
paper
in
the
other
your
pa
and
ma
s

in

and

oh

hooray
hooray
shouted
the
boys
and
jane
but
anthea
could
not
shout
she
was
nearer
crying
oh
she
said
almost
in
a
whisper
then
it
was
true
and
we
have
got
our
hearts
but
i
don
t
understand
about
the
letter
nurse
was
saying
i
haven
t
had
no
oh
said
jane
in
a
queer
voice
i
wonder
whether
it
was
one
of
those
they
came
that
night
you
know
when
we
were
playing
devil
in
the
dark
and
i
put
them
in
the
drawer
behind
the
and
she
pulled
out
the
drawer
as
she
spoke
and
here
they
are
there
was
a
letter
for
nurse
and
one
for
the
children
the
letters
told
how
father
had
done
being
a
and
was
coming
home
and
how
mother
and
the
lamb
were
going
to
meet
him
in
italy
and
all
come
home
together
and
how
the
lamb
and
mother
were
quite
well
and
how
a
telegram
would
be
sent
to
tell
the
day
and
the
hour
of
their
mercy
me
said
old
nurse
i
declare
if
it
s
not
too
bad
of
you
miss
jane
i
shall
have
a
nice
getting
things
straight
for
your
pa
and
oh
never

nurse
said
jane
hugging
her
isn
t
it
just
too
lovely
for
anything
we
ll
come
and
help
you
said
cyril
there
s
just
something
upstairs
we
ve
got
to
settle
up
and
then
we
ll
all

said
old
nurse
but
she
laughed
jollily
nice
help
you
d
be
i
know
you
and
it
s
ten
o
clock
there
was
in
fact
something
upstairs
that
they
had
to
settle
quite
a
considerable
something
too
and
it
took
much
longer
than
they
expected
a
hasty
rush
into
the
boys
room
secured
the
psammead
very
sandy
and
very
cross
it
doesn
t
matter
how
cross
and
sandy
it
is
though
said
anthea
it
ought
to
be
there
at
the
final
it
ll
give
the
learned
gentleman
fits
i
expect
said
robert
when
he
sees
but
it
didn
t
the
dream
is
growing
more
and
more
wonderful
he
exclaimed
when
the
psammead
had
been
explained
to
him
by
i
have
dreamed
this
beast
now
said
robert
jane
has
got
the
half
amulet
and
i
ve
got
the
whole
show
up
jane
untied
the
string
and
laid
her
half
amulet
on
the
table
littered
with
dusty
papers
and
the
clay
cylinders
marked
all
over
with
little
marks
like
the
little
prints
of
birds
little
feet
robert
laid
down
the
whole
amulet
and
anthea
gently
restrained
the
eager
hand
of
the
learned
gentleman
as
it
reached
out
yearningly
towards
the
perfect
specimen
and
then
just
as
before
on
the
marcella
quilt
so
now
on
the
dusty
litter
of
papers
and
curiosities
the
half
amulet
quivered
and
shook
and
then
as
steel
is
drawn
to
a
magnet
it
was
drawn
across
the
dusty
manuscripts
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
perfect
amulet
warm
from
the
pocket
of
robert
and
then
as
one
drop
of
water
mingles
with
another
when
the
panes
of
the
window
are
wrinkled
with
rain
as
one
bead
of
mercury
is
drawn
into
another
bead
the
half
amulet
that
was
the
children
s
and
was
also
s
slipped
into
the
whole
amulet
and
behold
there
was
only
one
the
perfect
and
ultimate
charm
and
that
s
all
right
said
the
psammead
breaking
a
breathless
silence
yes
said
anthea
and
we
ve
got
our
hearts
desire
father
and
mother
and
the
lamb
are
coming
home
but
what
about
me
said
what
is
your
heart
s
desire
anthea
asked
great
and
deep
learning
said
the
priest
without
a
moment
s
hesitation
a
learning
greater
and
deeper
than
that
of
any
man
of
my
land
and
my
time
but
learning
too
great
is
useless
if
i
go
back
to
my
own
land
and
my
own
age
who
will
believe
my
tales
of
what
i
have
seen
in
the
future
let
me
stay
here
be
the
great
knower
of
all
that
has
been
in
that
our
time
so
living
to
me
so
old
to
you
about
which
your
learned
men
speculate
unceasingly
and
often
he
tells
me
if
i
were
you
said
the
psammead
i
should
ask
the
amulet
about
that
it
s
a
dangerous
thing
trying
to
live
in
a
time
that
s
not
your
own
you
can
t
breathe
an
air
that
s
thousands
of
centuries
ahead
of
your
lungs
without
feeling
the
effects
of
it
sooner
or
later
prepare
the
mystic
circle
and
consult
the
oh
what
a
dream
cried
the
learned
gentleman
dear
children
if
you
love
me
and
i
think
you
do
in
dreams
and
out
of
them
prepare
the
mystic
circle
and
consult
the
amulet
they
did
as
once
before
when
the
sun
had
shone
in
august
splendour
they
crouched
in
a
circle
on
the
floor
now
the
air
outside
was
thick
and
yellow
with
the
fog
that
by
some
strange
decree
always
attends
the
cattle
show
week
and
in
the
street
costers
were
shouting
ur
hekau
setcheh
jane
said
the
name
of
power
and
instantly
the
light
went
out
and
all
the
sounds
went
out
too
so
that
there
was
a
silence
and
a
darkness
both
deeper
than
any
darkness
or
silence
that
you
have
ever
even
dreamed
of
imagining
it
was
like
being
deaf
or
blind
only
darker
and
quieter
even
than
that
then
out
of
that
vast
darkness
and
silence
came
a
light
and
a
voice
the
light
was
too
faint
to
see
anything
by
and
the
voice
was
too
small
for
you
to
hear
what
it
said
but
the
light
and
the
voice
grew
and
the
light
was
the
light
that
no
man
may
look
on
and
live
and
the
voice
was
the
sweetest
and
most
terrible
voice
in
the
world
the
children
cast
down
their
eyes
and
so
did
everyone
i
speak
said
the
voice
what
is
it
that
you
would
hear
there
was
a
pause
everyone
was
afraid
to
speak
what
are
we
to
do
about
said
robert
suddenly
and
abruptly
shall
he
go
back
through
the
amulet
to
his
own
time
or
no
one
can
pass
through
the
amulet
now
said
the
beautiful
terrible
voice
to
any
land
or
any
time
only
when
it
was
imperfect
could
such
things
be
but
men
may
pass
through
the
perfect
charm
to
the
perfect
union
which
is
not
of
time
or
would
you
be
so
very
kind
said
anthea
tremulously
as
to
speak
so
that
we
can
understand
you
the
psammead
said
something
about
not
being
able
to
live
here
and
if
he
can
t
get
back
she
stopped
her
heart
was
beating
desperately
in
her
throat
as
it
seemed
nobody
can
continue
to
live
in
a
land
and
in
a
time
not
appointed
said
the
voice
of
glorious
sweetness
but
a
soul
may
live
if
in
that
other
time
and
land
there
be
found
a
soul
so
akin
to
it
as
to
offer
it
refuge
in
the
body
of
that
land
and
time
that
thus
they
two
may
be
one
soul
in
one
the
children
exchanged
discouraged
glances
but
the
eyes
of
and
the
learned
gentleman
met
and
were
kind
to
each
other
and
promised
each
other
many
things
secret
and
sacred
and
very
beautiful
anthea
saw
the
look
oh
but
she
said
without
at
all
meaning
to
say
it
dear
jimmy
s
soul
isn
t
at
all
like
s
i
m
certain
it
isn
t
i
don
t
want
to
be
rude
but
it
isn
t
you
know
dear
jimmy
s
soul
is
as
good
as
gold
and
nothing
that
is
not
good
can
pass
beneath
the
double
arch
of
my
perfect
amulet
said
the
voice
if
both
are
willing
say
the
word
of
power
and
let
the
two
souls
become
one
for
ever
and
ever
shall
i
asked
jane
the
voices
were
those
of
the
egyptian
priest
and
the
learned
gentleman
and
the
voices
were
eager
alive
thrilled
with
hope
and
the
desire
of
great
things
so
jane
took
the
amulet
from
robert
and
held
it
up
between
the
two
men
and
said
for
the
last
time
the
word
of
power
ur
hekau
the
perfect
amulet
grew
into
a
double
arch
the
two
arches
leaned
to
each
other
making
a
great
a
a
stands
for
amen
whispered
jane
what
he
was
a
priest
hush
breathed
anthea
the
great
double
arch
glowed
in
and
through
the
green
light
that
had
been
there
since
the
name
of
power
had
first
been
spoken
it
glowed
with
a
light
more
bright
yet
more
soft
than
the
other
light
a
glory
and
splendour
and
sweetness
unspeakable
come
cried
holding
out
his
hands
come
cried
the
learned
gentleman
and
he
also
held
out
his
hands
each
moved
forward
under
the
glowing
glorious
arch
of
the
perfect
amulet
then
quavered
and
shook
and
as
steel
is
drawn
to
a
magnet
he
was
drawn
under
the
arch
of
magic
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
learned
gentleman
and
as
one
drop
of
water
mingles
with
another
when
the
is
as
one
bead
is
drawn
to
another
bead
divine
father
of
the
temple
of
was
drawn
into
slipped
into
disappeared
into
and
was
one
with
jimmy
the
good
the
beloved
the
learned
gentleman
and
suddenly
it
was
good
daylight
and
the
december
sun
shone
the
fog
has
passed
away
like
a
dream
the
amulet
was
there
little
and
complete
in
jane
s
hand
and
there
were
the
other
children
and
the
psammead
and
the
learned
gentleman
but
or
the
body
of
was
not
there
any
more
as
for
his
soul
oh
the
horrid
thing
cried
robert
and
put
his
foot
on
a
centipede
as
long
as
your
finger
that
crawled
and
wriggled
and
squirmed
at
the
learned
gentleman
s
feet
that
said
the
psammead
was
the
evil
in
the
soul
of
there
was
a
deep
silence
then
s
him
now
said
jane
at
last
all
that
was
good
in
said
the
psammead
he
ought
to
have
his
heart
s
desire
too
said
anthea
in
a
sort
of
stubborn
gentleness
his
heart
s
desire
said
the
psammead
is
the
perfect
amulet

hold
in
your
hand
yes
and
has
been
ever
since
he
first
saw
the
broken
half
of
we

anthea
softly

the
psammead
its
voice
was
crosser
than
they
had
ever
heard
it

parents

what

said
the
learned
gentleman
absently
yet
polite
as
ever
the
psammead
swelled
itself
up
turned
its
long
snail
s
eyes
in
one
last
lingering
look
at
anthea
a
loving
look
she
always
said
and
thought
and
vanished
well
said
anthea
after
a
silence
i
suppose
it
s
happy

only
thing

ever
did
really
care
for

the
learned
gentleman

a
ring
at
the
bell

opening
of
a
door

cried
robert
and
a
thrill
ran
through
four
hearts
here
cried
anthea
snatching
the
amulet
from
jane
and
pressing
it
into
the
hand
of
the
learned
gentleman
here
it

she
hugged
him
briefly
but
fervently
and
the
four
swept
down
the
stairs
to
the
hall
where
a
cabman
was
bringing
in
boxes
and
where
heavily
disguised
in
travelling
cloaks
and
wraps
