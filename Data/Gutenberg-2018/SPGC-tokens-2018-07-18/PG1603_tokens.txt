the
blue
flower
by
henry
van
dyke
the
desire
of
the
moth
for
the
star
of
the
night
for
the
morrow
the
devotion
for
something
afar
from
the
sphere
of
our
sorrow
shelley
to
the
dear
memory
of
bernard
van
dyke
and
the
love
that
lives
beyond
the
years
preface
sometimes
short
stories
are
brought
together
like
parcels
in
a
basket
sometimes
they
grow
together
like
blossoms
on
a
bush
then
of
course
they
really
belong
to
one
another
because
they
have
the
same
life
in
them
the
stories
in
this
book
have
been
growing
together
for
a
long
time
it
is
at
least
ten
years
since
the
first
of
them
the
story
of
the
other
wise
man
came
to
me
and
all
the
others
i
knew
quite
well
by
heart
a
good
while
before
i
could
find
the
time
in
a
life
to
write
them
down
and
try
to
make
them
clear
and
true
to
others
it
has
been
a
slow
task
because
the
right
word
has
not
always
been
easy
to
find
and
i
wanted
to
keep
free
from
conventionality
in
the
thought
and
close
to
nature
in
the
picture
it
is
enough
to
cause
a
man
no
little
shame
to
see
how
small
is
the
fruit
of
so
long
labour
and
yet
after
all
when
one
wishes
to
write
about
life
especially
about
that
part
of
it
which
is
inward
the
inwrought
experience
of
living
may
be
of
value
and
that
is
a
thing
which
one
can
not
get
in
haste
neither
can
it
be
made
to
order
patient
waiting
belongs
to
it
and
rainy
days
belong
to
it
and
the
best
of
it
sometimes
comes
in
the
doing
of
tasks
that
seem
not
to
amount
to
much
so
in
the
long
run
i
suppose
while
delay
and
failure
and
interruption
may
keep
a
piece
of
work
very
small
yet
in
the
end
they
enter
into
the
quality
of
it
and
bring
it
a
little
nearer
to
the
real
thing
which
is
always
more
or
less
of
a
secret
but
the
strangest
part
of
it
all
is
the
way
in
which
a
single
thought
an
idea
will
live
with
a
man
while
he
works
and
take
new
forms
from
year
to
year
and
light
up
the
things
that
he
sees
and
hears
and
lead
his
imagination
by
the
hand
into
many
wonderful
and
diverse
regions
it
seems
to
me
that
there
am
two
ways
in
which
you
may
give
unity
to
a
book
of
stories
you
may
stay
in
one
place
and
write
about
different
themes
preserving
always
the
colour
of
the
same
locality
or
you
may
go
into
different
places
and
use
as
many
of
the
colours
and
shapes
of
life
as
you
can
really
see
in
the
light
of
the
same
thought
there
is
such
a
thought
in
this
book
it
is
the
idea
of
the
search
for
inward
happiness
which
all
men
who
are
really
alive
are
following
along
what
various
paths
and
with
what
different
fortunes
glimpses
of
this
idea
traces
of
this
search
i
thought
that
i
could
see
in
certain
tales
that
were
in
my
mind
tales
of
times
old
and
new
of
lands
near
and
far
away
so
i
tried
to
tell
them
as
best
as
i
could
hoping
that
other
men
being
also
seekers
might
find
some
meaning
in
them
there
are
only
little
broken
chapters
from
the
long
story
of
life
none
of
them
is
taken
from
other
books
only
one
of
them
the
story
of
winifried
and
the
has
the
slightest
wisp
of
a
foundation
in
fact
or
legend
yet
i
think
they
are
all
true
but
how
to
find
a
name
for
such
a
book
a
name
that
will
tell
enough
to
show
the
thought
and
yet
not
too
much
to
leave
it
free
i
have
borrowed
a
symbol
from
the
old
german
poet
and
philosopher
novalis
to
stand
instead
of
a
name
the
blue
flower
which
he
used
in
his
romance
of
heinrich
von
ofterdingen
to
symbolise
poetry
the
object
of
his
young
hero
s
quest
i
have
used
here
to
signify
happiness
the
satisfaction
of
the
heart
reader
will
you
take
the
book
and
see
if
it
belongs
to
you
whether
it
does
or
not
my
wish
is
that
the
blue
flower
may
grow
in
the
garden

the
first
the
blue
flower
the
parents
were
abed
and
sleeping
the
clock
on
the
wall
ticked
loudly
and
lazily
as
if
it
had
time
to
spare
outside
the
rattling
windows
there
was
a
restless
whispering
wind
the
room
grew
light
and
dark
and
wondrous
light
again
as
the
moon
played
through
the
clouds
the
boy
and
quiet
in
his
bed
was
thinking
of
the
stranger
and
his
stories
it
was
not
what
he
told
me
about
the
treasures
he
said
to
himself
that
was
not
the
thing
which
filled
me
with
so
strange
a
longing
i
am
not
greedy
for
riches
but
the
blue
flower
is
what
i
long
for
i
can
think
of
nothing
else
never
have
i
felt
so
before
it
seems
as
if
i
had
been
dreaming
until
now
or
as
if
i
had
just
slept
over
into
a
new
world
who
cared
for
flowers
in
the
old
world
where
i
used
to
live
i
never
heard
of
anyone
whose
whole
heart
was
set
upon
finding
a
flower
but
now
i
can
not
even
tell
all
that
i
feel
sometimes
as
happy
as
if
i
were
enchanted
but
when
the
flower
fades
from
me
when
i
can
not
see
it
in
my
mind
then
it
is
like
being
very
thirsty
and
all
alone
that
is
what
the
other
people
could
not
understand
once
upon
a
time
they
say
the
animals
and
the
trees
and
the
flowers
used
to
talk
to
people
it
seems
to
me
every
minute
as
if
they
were
just
going
to
begin
again
when
i
look
at
them
i
can
see
what
they
want
to
say
there
must
be
a
great
many
words
that
i
do
not
know
if
i
knew
more
of
them
perhaps
i
could
understand
things
better
i
used
to
love
to
dance
but
now
i
like
better
to
think
after
the
gradually
the
boy
lost
himself
in
sweet
fancies
and
suddenly
he
found
himself
again
in
the
charmed
land
of
sleep
he
wandered
in
far
countries
rich
and
strange
he
traversed
wild
waters
with
incredible
swiftness
marvellous
creatures
appeared
and
vanished
he
lived
with
all
sorts
of
men
in
battles
in
whirling
crowds
in
lonely
huts
he
was
cast
into
prison
he
fell
into
dire
distress
and
want
all
experiences
seemed
to
be
sharpened
to
an
edge
he
felt
them
keenly
yet
they
did
not
harm
him
he
died
and
came
alive
again
he
loved
to
the
height
of
passion
and
then
was
parted
forever
from
his
beloved
at
last
toward
morning
as
the
dawn
was
stealing
near
his
soul
grew
calm
and
the
pictures
showed
more
clear
and
firm
it
seemed
as
if
he
were
walking
alone
through
the
deep
woods
seldom
the
daylight
shimmered
through
the
green
veil
soon
he
came
to
a
rocky
gorge
in
the
mountains
under
the
mossy
stones
in
the
bed
of
the
stream
he
heard
the
water
secretly
tinkling
downward
ever
downward
as
he
climbed
upward
the
forest
grew
thinner
and
lighter
he
came
to
a
fair
meadow
on
the
slope
of
the
mountain
beyond
the
meadow
was
a
high
cliff
and
in
the
face
of
the
cliff
an
opening
like
the
entrance
to
a
path
dark
was
the
way
but
smooth
and
he
followed
easily
on
till
he
came
near
to
a
vast
cavern
from
which
a
flood
of
radiance
streamed
to
meet
him
as
he
entered
he
beheld
a
mighty
beam
of
light
which
sprang
from
the
ground
shattering
itself
against
the
roof
in
countless
sparks
falling
and
flowing
all
together
into
a
great
pool
in
the
rock
brighter
was
the
than
molten
gold
but
silent
in
its
rise
and
silent
in
its
fall
the
sacred
stillness
of
a
shrine
a
hush
of
joy
and
wonder
filled
the
cavern
cool
was
the
dripping
radiance
that
softly
trickled
down
the
walls
and
the
light
that
rippled
from
them
was
pale
blue
but
the
pool
as
the
boy
drew
near
and
watched
it
quivered
and
glanced
with
the
colours
of
a
liquid
opal
he
dipped
his
hands
in
it
and
wet
his
lips
it
seemed
as
if
a
lively
breeze
passed
through
his
heart
he
felt
an
irresistible
desire
to
bathe
in
the
pool
slipping
off
his
clothes
he
plunged
in
it
was
as
if
he
bathed
in
a
cloud
of
sunset
a
celestial
rapture
flowed
through
him
the
waves
of
the
stream
were
like
a
bevy
of
nymphs
taking
shape
around
him
clinging
to
him
with
tender
breasts
as
he
floated
onward
lost
in
delight
yet
keenly
sensitive
to
every
impression
swiftly
the
current
bore
him
out
of
the
pool
into
a
hollow
in
the
cliff
here
a
dimness
of
slumber
shadowed
his
eyes
while
he
felt
the
pressure
of
the
loveliest
dreams
when
he
awoke
again
he
was
aware
of
a
new
fulness
of
light
purer
and
steadier
than
the
first
radiance
he
found
himself
lying
on
the
green
turf
in
the
open
air
beside
a
little
fountain
which
sparkled
up
and
melted
away
in
silver
spray
were
the
rocks
that
rose
at
a
little
distance
veined
with
white
as
if
strange
words
were
written
upon
them
was
the
sky
and
cloudless
all
passion
had
dissolved
away
from
him
every
sound
was
music
every
breath
was
peace
the
rocks
were
like
sentinels
protecting
him
the
sky
was
like
a
cup
of
blessing
full
of
tranquil
light
but
what
charmed
him
most
and
drew
him
with
resistless
power
was
a
tall
flower
growing
beside
the
spring
and
almost
touching
him
with
its
broad
glistening
leaves
round
about
were
many
other
flowers
of
all
hues
their
odours
mingled
in
a
perfect
chord
of
fragrance
he
saw
nothing
but
the
blue
flower
long
and
tenderly
he
gazed
at
it
with
unspeakable
love
at
last
he
felt
that
he
must
go
a
little
nearer
to
it
when
suddenly
it
began
to
move
and
change
the
leaves
glistened
more
brightly
and
drew
themselves
up
closely
around
the
swiftly
growing
stalk
the
flower
bent
itself
toward
him
and
the
petals
showed
a
blue
spreading
necklace
of
sapphires
out
of
which
the
lovely
face
of
a
girl
smiled
softly
into
his
eyes
his
sweet
astonishment
grew
with
the
wondrous
transformation
all
at
once
he
heard
his
mother
s
voice
calling
him
and
awoke
in
his
parents
room
already
flooded
with
the
gold
of
the
morning
sun
from
the
german
of
novalis
the
source
i
in
the
middle
of
the
land
that
is
called
by
its
inhabitants
koorma
and
by
strangers
the
land
of
the
i
was
toiling
all
day
long
through
heavy
sand
and
grass
as
hard
as
wire
suddenly
toward
evening
i
came
upon
a
place
where
a
gate
opened
in
the
wall
of
mountains
and
the
plain
ran
in
through
the
gate
making
a
little
bay
of
level
country
among
the
hills
now
this
bay
was
not
brown
and
hard
and
dry
like
the
mountains
above
me
neither
was
it
covered
with
tawny
billows
of
sand
like
the
desert
along
the
edge
of
which
i
had
wearily
coasted
but
the
surface
of
it
was
smooth
and
green
and
as
the
winds
of
twilight
breathed
across
it
they
were
followed
by
soft
waves
of
verdure
with
silvery
turnings
of
the
under
sides
of
many
leaves
like
ripples
on
a
quiet
harbour
there
were
fields
of
corn
filled
with
silken
rustling
and
vineyards
with
long
rows
of
trimmed
standing
each
one
like
an
emerald
goblet
wreathed
with
vines
and
as
bright
as
if
the
earth
had
been
embroidered
with
threads
of
blue
and
scarlet
and
gold
and
frosted
over
with
delicate
and
fragrant
blossoms
cottages
were
scattered
everywhere
through
the
sea
of
greenery
and
in
the
centre
like
a
white
ship
surrounded
by
a
flock
of
little
boats
rested
a
small
fair
shining
city
i
wondered
greatly
how
this
beauty
had
come
into
being
on
the
border
of
the
desert
passing
through
the
fields
and
gardens
and
orchards
i
found
that
they
were
all
encircled
and
lined
with
channels
full
of
running
water
i
followed
up
one
of
the
smaller
channels
until
it
came
to
a
larger
stream
and
as
i
walked
on
beside
it
still
going
upward
it
guided
me
into
the
midst
of
the
city
where
i
saw
a
sweet
merry
river
flowing
through
the
main
street
with
abundance
of
water
and
a
very
pleasant
sound
there
were
houses
and
shops
and
lofty
palaces
and
all
that
makes
a
city
but
the
life
and
joy
of
all
and
the
one
thing
that
i
remember
best
was
the
river
for
in
the
open
square
at
the
edge
of
the
city
there
were
marble
pools
where
the
children
might
bathe
and
play
at
the
corners
of
the
streets
and
on
the
sides
of
the
houses
there
were
fountains
for
the
drawing
of
water
at
every
crossing
a
stream
was
turned
aside
to
run
out
to
the
vineyards
and
the
river
was
the
mother
of
them
all
there
were
but
few
people
in
the
streets
and
none
of
the
older
folk
from
whom
i
might
ask
counsel
or
a
lodging
so
i
stood
and
knocked
at
the
door
of
a
house
it
was
opened
by
an
old
man
who
greeted
me
with
kindness
and
bade
me
enter
as
his
guest
after
much
courteous
entertainment
and
when
supper
was
ended
his
friendly
manner
and
something
of
singular
attractiveness
in
his
countenance
led
me
to
tell
him
of
my
strange
journeyings
in
the
land
of
koorma
and
in
other
lands
where
i
had
been
seeking
the
blue
flower
and
to
inquire
of
him
the
name
and
the
story
of
his
city
and
the
cause
of
the
river
which
made
it
glad
my
son
he
answered
this
is
the
city
which
was
called
ablis
that
is
to
say
forsaken
for
long
ago
men
lived
here
and
the
river
made
their
fields
fertile
and
their
dwellings
were
full
of
plenty
and
peace
but
because
of
many
evil
things
which
have
been
the
river
was
turned
aside
or
else
it
was
dried
up
at
its
source
in
the
high
place
among
the
mountains
so
that
the
water
flowed
down
no
more
the
channels
and
the
trenches
and
the
marble
pools
and
the
basins
beside
the
houses
remained
but
they
were
empty
so
the
gardens
withered
the
fields
were
barren
the
city
was
desolate
and
in
the
broken
cisterns
there
was
scanty
water
then
there
came
one
from
a
distant
country
who
was
very
sorrowful
to
see
the
desolation
he
told
the
people
that
it
was
vain
to
dig
new
cisterns
and
to
keep
the
channels
and
trenches
clean
for
the
water
had
come
only
from
above
the
source
must
be
found
again
and
reopened
the
river
would
not
flow
unless
they
traced
it
back
to
the
spring
and
visited
it
continually
and
offered
prayers
and
praises
beside
it
without
ceasing
then
the
spring
would
rise
to
an
outpouring
and
the
water
would
run
down
plentifully
to
make
the
gardens
blossom
and
the
city
rejoice
so
he
went
forth
to
open
the
fountain
but
there
were
few
that
went
with
him
for
he
was
a
poor
man
of
lowly
aspect
and
the
path
upward
was
steep
and
rough
but
his
companions
saw
that
as
he
climbed
among
the
rocks
little
streams
of
water
gushed
from
the
places
where
he
trod
and
pools
began
to
gather
in
the
dry
he
went
more
swiftly
than
they
could
follow
him
and
at
length
he
passed
out
of
their
sight
a
little
farther
on
they
came
to
the
rising
of
the
river
and
there
beside
the
overflowing
source
they
found
their
leader
lying
that
was
a
strange
thing
i
cried
and
very
pitiful
tell
me
how
it
came
to
pass
and
what
was
the
meaning
of
i
can
not
tell
the
whole
of
the
meaning
replied
the
old
man
after
a
little
pause
for
it
was
many
years
ago
but
this
poor
man
had
many
enemies
in
the
city
chiefly
among
the
makers
of
cisterns
who
hated
him
for
his
words
i
believe
that
they
went
out
after
him
secretly
and
slew
him
but
his
followers
came
back
to
the
city
and
as
they
came
the
river
began
to
run
down
very
gently
after
them
they
returned
to
the
source
day
by
day
bringing
others
with
them
for
they
said
that
their
leader
was
really
alive
though
the
form
of
his
life
had
changed
and
that
he
met
them
in
that
high
place
while
they
remembered
him
and
prayed
and
sang
songs
of
praise
more
and
more
the
people
learned
to
go
with
them
and
the
path
grew
plainer
and
easier
to
find
the
more
the
source
was
revisited
the
more
abundant
it
became
and
the
more
it
filled
the
river
all
the
channels
and
the
basins
were
supplied
with
water
and
men
made
new
channels
which
were
also
filled
some
of
those
who
were
diggers
of
trenches
and
hewers
of
cisterns
said
that
it
was
their
work
which
had
wrought
the
change
but
the
wisest
and
best
among
the
people
knew
that
it
all
came
from
the
source
and
they
taught
that
if
it
should
ever
again
be
forgotten
and
left
unvisited
the
river
would
fail
again
and
desolation
return
so
every
day
from
the
gardens
and
orchards
and
the
streets
of
the
city
men
and
women
and
children
have
gone
up
the
with
singing
to
rejoice
beside
the
spring
from
which
the
river
flows
and
to
remember
the
one
who
opened
it
we
call
it
the
river
carita
and
the
name
of
the
city
is
no
more
ablis
but
saloma
which
is
peace
and
the
name
of
him
who
died
to
find
the
source
for
us
is
so
dear
that
we
speak
it
only
when
we
pray
but
there
are
many
things
yet
to
learn
about
our
city
and
some
that
seem
dark
and
cast
a
shadow
on
my
thoughts
therefore
my
son
i
bid
you
to
be
my
guest
for
there
is
a
room
in
my
house
for
the
stranger
and
and
on
the
following
days
you
shall
see
how
life
goes
with
us
and
read
if
you
can
the
secret
of
the
that
night
i
slept
well
as
one
who
has
heard
a
pleasant
tale
with
the
murmur
of
running
water
woven
through
my
dreams
and
the
next
day
i
went
out
early
into
the
streets
for
i
was
curious
to
see
the
manner
of
the
visitation
of
the
source
already
the
people
were
coming
forth
and
turning
their
steps
upward
in
the
beside
the
river
some
of
them
went
alone
swiftly
and
in
silence
others
were
in
groups
of
two
or
three
talking
as
they
went
others
were
in
larger
companies
and
they
sang
together
very
gladly
and
sweetly
but
there
were
many
people
who
remained
working
in
their
fields
or
in
their
houses
or
stayed
talking
on
the
corners
of
the
streets
therefore
i
joined
myself
to
one
of
the
men
who
walked
alone
and
asked
him
why
all
the
people
did
not
go
to
the
spring
since
the
life
of
the
city
depended
upon
it
and
whether
perhaps
the
way
was
so
long
and
so
hard
that
none
but
the
strongest
could
undertake
it
sir
said
he
i
perceive
that
you
are
a
stranger
for
the
way
is
both
short
and
easy
so
that
the
children
are
those
who
most
delight
in
it
and
if
a
man
were
in
great
haste
he
could
go
there
and
return
in
a
little
while
but
of
those
who
remain
behind
some
are
the
busy
ones
who
must
visit
the
fountain
at
another
hour
and
some
are
the
careless
ones
who
take
life
as
it
comes
and
never
think
where
it
comes
from
and
some
are
those
who
do
not
believe
in
the
source
and
will
hear
nothing
about
how
can
that
be
i
said
do
they
not
drink
of
the
water
and
does
it
not
make
their
fields
green
it
is
true
he
said
but
these
men
have
made
wells
close
by
the
river
and
they
say
that
these
wells
fill
themselves
and
they
have
digged
channels
through
their
gardens
and
they
say
that
these
channels
would
always
have
water
in
them
even
though
the
spring
should
cease
to
flow
some
of
them
say
also
that
it
is
an
unworthy
thing
to
drink
from
a
source
that
another
has
opened
and
that
every
man
ought
to
find
a
new
spring
for
himself
so
they
spend
the
hour
of
the
visitation
and
many
more
in
searching
among
the
mountains
where
there
is
no
while
i
wondered
over
this
we
kept
on
in
the
way
there
was
already
quite
a
throng
of
people
all
going
in
the
same
direction
and
when
we
came
to
the
source
which
flowed
from
an
opening
in
a
cliff
almost
like
a
chamber
hewn
in
the
rock
and
made
a
little
garden
of
around
it
as
it
fell
i
heard
the
music
of
many
voices
and
the
beautiful
name
of
him
who
had
given
his
life
to
find
the
forgotten
spring
then
we
came
down
again
singly
and
in
groups
following
the
river
it
seemed
already
more
bright
and
full
and
joyous
as
we
passed
through
the
gardens
i
saw
men
turning
aside
to
make
new
channels
through
fields
which
were
not
yet
cultivated
and
as
we
entered
the
city
i
saw
the
wheels
of
the
mills
that
ground
the
corn
whirling
more
swiftly
and
the
maidens
coming
with
their
pitchers
to
draw
from
the
brimming
basins
at
the
street
corners
and
the
children
laughing
because
the
marble
pools
were
so
full
that
they
could
swim
in
them
there
was
plenty
of
water
everywhere
for
many
weeks
i
stayed
in
the
city
of
saloma
going
up
the
in
the
morning
and
returning
to
the
day
of
work
and
the
evening
of
play
i
found
friends
among
the
people
of
the
city
not
only
among
those
who
walked
together
in
the
visitation
of
the
source
but
also
among
those
who
remained
behind
for
many
of
them
were
kind
and
generous
faithful
in
their
work
and
very
pleasant
in
their
conversation
yet
there
was
something
lacking
between
me
and
them
i
came
not
onto
firm
ground
with
them
for
all
their
warmth
of
welcome
and
their
pleasant
ways
they
were
by
nature
of
the
race
of
those
who
dwell
ever
in
one
place
even
in
their
thoughts
they
went
not
far
abroad
but
i
have
been
ever
a
seeker
and
the
world
seems
to
me
made
to
wander
in
rather
than
to
abide
in
one
corner
of
it
and
never
see
what
the
rest
has
in
store
now
this
was
what
the
people
of
saloma
could
not
understand
and
for
this
reason
i
seemed
to
them
always
a
stranger
an
alien
a
guest
the
fixed
circle
of
their
life
was
like
an
invisible
wall
and
with
the
best
will
in
the
world
they
knew
not
how
to
draw
me
within
it
and
i
for
my
part
while
i
understood
well
their
wish
to
rest
and
be
at
peace
could
not
quite
understand
the
way
in
which
it
found
fulfilment
nor
share
the
repose
which
seemed
to
them
and
lasting
in
their
gardens
i
saw
ever
the
same
flowers
and
none
perfect
at
their
feasts
i
tasted
ever
the
same
food
and
none
that
made
an
end
of
hunger
in
their
talk
i
heard
ever
the
same
words
and
none
that
went
to
the
depth
of
thought
the
very
quietude
and
fixity
of
their
being
perplexed
and
estranged
me
what
to
them
was
permanent
to
me
was
transient
they
were
inhabitants
i
was
a
visitor
the
one
in
all
the
city
of
saloma
with
whom
was
most
at
home
was
ruamie
the
little
granddaughter
of
the
old
man
with
whom
i
lodged
to
her
a
girl
of
thirteen
and
full
of
joy
the
wonted
round
of
life
had
not
yet
grown
to
be
a
matter
of
course
she
was
quick
to
feel
and
answer
the
newness
of
every
day
that
dawned
when
a
strange
bird
flew
down
from
the
mountains
into
the
gardens
it
was
she
that
saw
it
and
wondered
at
it
it
was
she
that
walked
with
me
most
often
in
the
path
to
the
source
she
went
out
with
me
to
the
fields
in
the
morning
and
almost
every
day
found
that
were
new
to
me
at
sunset
she
drew
me
to
happy
games
of
youths
and
children
where
her
fancy
was
never
tired
of
weaving
new
turns
to
the
familiar
pastimes
in
the
dusk
she
would
sit
beside
me
in
an
arbour
of
honeysuckle
and
question
me
about
the
flower
that
i
was
seeking
for
to
her
i
had
often
spoken
of
my
quest
is
it
blue
she
asked
as
blue
as
the
speedwell
that
grows
beside
the
brook
yes
it
is
as
much
bluer
than
the
speedwell
as
the
river
is
deeper
than
the
and
is
it
she
asked
as
bright
as
the
drops
of
dew
in
the
moonlight
yes
it
is
brighter
than
the
drops
of
dew
as
the
sun
is
clearer
than
the
and
is
it
sweet
she
asked
as
sweet
as
the
honeysuckle
when
the
day
is
warm
and
still
yes
it
is
as
much
sweeter
than
the
honeysuckle
as
the
night
is
stiller
and
more
sweet
than
the
tell
me
again
she
asked
when
you
saw
it
and
why
do
you
seek
it
once
i
saw
it
when
i
was
a
boy
no
older
than
you
our
house
looked
out
toward
the
hills
far
away
and
at
sunset
softly
blue
against
the
eastern
sky
it
was
the
day
that
we
laid
my
father
to
rest
in
the
little
among
the
there
was
his
father
s
grave
and
his
father
s
father
s
grave
and
there
were
the
places
for
my
mother
and
for
my
two
brothers
and
for
my
sister
and
for
me
i
counted
them
all
when
the
others
had
gone
back
to
the
house
i
paced
up
and
down
alone
measuring
the
ground
there
was
room
enough
for
us
all
and
in
the
western
corner
where
a
young
was
growing
that
would
be
my
place
for
i
was
the
youngest
how
tall
would
the
be
then
i
had
never
thought
of
it
before
it
seemed
to
make
me
sad
and
restless
wishing
for
something
i
knew
not
what
longing
to
see
the
world
and
to
taste
happiness
before
i
must
sleep
beneath
the
then
i
looked
off
to
the
blue
hills
shadowy
and
the
boundary
of
the
little
world
that
i
knew
and
there
in
a
cleft
between
the
highest
peaks
i
saw
a
wondrous
thing
for
the
place
at
which
i
was
looking
seemed
to
come
nearer
and
nearer
to
me
i
saw
the
trees
the
rocks
the
ferns
the
white
road
winding
before
me
the
enfolding
hills
unclosed
like
leaves
and
in
the
heart
of
them
i
saw
a
blue
flower
so
bright
so
beautiful
that
my
eyes
filled
with
tears
as
i
looked
it
was
like
a
face
that
smiled
at
me
and
promised
something
then
i
heard
a
call
like
the
note
of
a
trumpet
very
far
away
calling
me
to
come
and
as
i
listened
the
flower
faded
into
the
dimness
of
the
did
you
follow
it
asked
ruamie
and
did
you
go
away
from
your
home
how
could
you
do
that
yes
ruamie
when
the
time
came
as
soon
as
i
was
free
i
set
out
on
my
journey
and
my
home
is
at
the
end
of
the
journey
wherever
that
may
and
the
flower
she
asked
you
have
seen
it
again
once
again
when
i
was
a
youth
i
saw
it
after
a
long
voyage
upon
stormy
seas
we
came
into
a
quiet
haven
and
there
the
friend
who
was
dearest
to
me
said
for
he
was
going
back
to
his
own
country
and
his
father
s
house
but
i
was
still
journeying
onward
so
as
i
stood
at
the
bow
of
the
ship
sailing
out
into
the
wide
blue
water
far
away
among
the
sparkling
waves
i
saw
a
little
island
with
shores
of
silver
sand
and
slopes
of
fairest
green
and
in
the
middle
of
the
island
the
blue
flower
was
growing
wondrous
tall
and
dazzling
brighter
than
the
sapphire
of
the
sea
then
the
call
of
the
distant
trumpet
came
floating
across
the
water
and
while
it
was
sounding
a
shimmer
of
fog
swept
over
the
island
and
i
could
see
it
no
was
it
a
real
island
asked
ruamie
did
you
ever
find
it
never
for
the
ship
sailed
another
way
but
once
again
i
saw
the
flower
three
days
before
i
came
to
saloma
it
was
on
the
edge
of
the
desert
close
under
the
shadow
of
the
great
mountains
a
vast
loneliness
was
round
about
me
it
seemed
as
if
i
was
the
only
soul
living
upon
earth
and
i
longed
for
the
dwellings
of
men
then
as
i
woke
in
the
morning
i
looked
up
at
the
dark
ridge
of
the
mountains
and
there
against
the
brightening
blue
of
the
sky
i
saw
the
blue
flower
standing
up
clear
and
brave
it
shone
so
deep
and
pure
that
the
sky
grew
pale
around
it
then
the
echo
of
the
trumpet
drifted
down
the
hillsides
and
the
sun
rose
and
the
flower
was
melted
away
in
light
so
i
rose
and
travelled
on
till
i
came
to
and
now
said
the
child
you
are
at
home
with
us
will
you
not
stay
for
a
long
long
while
you
may
find
the
blue
flower
here
there
are
many
kinds
in
the
fields
i
find
new
ones
every
i
will
stay
while
i
can
ruamie
i
answered
taking
her
hand
in
mine
as
we
walked
back
to
the
house
at
nightfall
but
how
long
that
may
be
i
can
not
tell
for
with
you
i
am
at
home
yet
the
place
where
i
must
abide
is
the
place
where
the
flower
grows
and
when
the
call
comes
i
must
follow
yes
said
she
looking
at
me
half
in
doubt
i
think
i
understand
but
wherever
you
go
i
hope
you
will
find
the
flower
at
in
truth
there
were
many
things
in
the
city
that
troubled
me
and
made
me
restless
in
spite
of
the
sweet
comfort
of
ruamie
s
friendship
and
the
tranquillity
of
the
life
in
saloma
i
came
to
see
the
meaning
of
what
the
old
man
had
said
about
the
shadow
that
rested
upon
his
thoughts
for
there
were
some
in
the
city
who
said
that
the
hours
of
visitation
were
wasted
and
that
it
would
be
better
to
employ
the
time
in
gathering
water
from
the
pools
that
formed
among
the
mountains
in
the
rainy
season
or
in
sinking
wells
along
the
edge
of
the
desert
others
had
newly
come
to
the
city
and
were
teaching
that
there
was
no
source
and
that
the
story
of
the
poor
man
who
reopened
it
was
a
fable
and
that
the
hours
of
visitation
were
only
hours
of
dreaming
there
were
many
who
believed
them
and
many
more
who
said
that
it
did
not
matter
whether
their
words
were
true
or
false
and
that
it
was
of
small
moment
whether
men
went
to
visit
the
fountain
or
not
provided
only
that
they
worked
in
the
gardens
and
kept
the
marble
pools
and
basins
in
repair
and
opened
new
canals
through
the
fields
since
there
always
had
been
and
always
would
be
plenty
of
water
as
i
listened
to
these
sayings
it
seemed
to
me
doubtful
what
the
end
of
the
city
would
be
and
while
this
doubt
was
yet
heavy
upon
me
i
heard
at
midnight
the
faint
calling
of
the
trumpet
sounding
along
the
crest
of
the
mountains
and
as
i
went
out
to
look
where
it
came
from
i
saw
through
the
glimmering
veil
of
the
milky
way
the
shape
of
a
blossom
of
celestial
blue
whose
petals
seemed
to
fall
and
fade
as
i
looked
so
i
bade
farewell
to
the
old
man
in
whose
house
i
had
learned
to
love
the
hour
of
visitation
and
the
source
and
the
name
of
him
who
opened
it
and
i
kissed
the
hands
and
the
brow
of
the
little
ruamie
who
had
entered
my
heart
and
went
forth
sadly
from
the
land
of
koorma
into
other
lands
to
look
for
the
blue
flower
ii
in
the
book
of
the
voyage
without
a
harbour
is
written
the
record
of
the
ten
years
which
passed
before
i
came
back
again
to
the
city
of
saloma
it
was
not
easy
to
find
for
i
came
down
through
the
mountains
and
as
i
looked
from
a
distant
shoulder
of
the
hills
for
the
little
bay
full
of
greenery
it
was
not
to
be
seen
there
was
only
a
white
town
shining
far
off
against
the
brown
cliffs
like
a
flake
of
mica
in
a
cleft
of
the
rocks
then
i
slept
that
night
full
of
care
on
the
hillside
and
rising
before
dawn
came
down
in
the
early
morning
toward
the
city
the
fields
were
lying
parched
and
yellow
under
the
sunrise
and
great
cracks
gaped
in
the
earth
as
if
it
were
thirsty
the
trenches
and
channels
were
still
there
but
there
was
little
water
in
them
and
through
the
ragged
fringes
of
the
rusty
vineyards
i
heard
instead
of
the
cheerful
songs
of
the
vintagers
the
creaking
of
dry
windlasses
and
the
hoarse
throb
of
the
pumps
in
sunken
wells
the
girdle
of
gardens
had
shrunk
like
a
wreath
of
withered
flowers
and
all
the
bright
embroidery
of
earth
was
faded
to
a
sullen
gray
at
the
foot
of
an
ancient
leafless
i
saw
a
group
of
people
kneeling
around
a
newly
opened
well
i
asked
a
man
who
was
digging
beside
the
dusty
path
what
this
might
mean
he
straightened
himself
for
a
moment
wiping
the
sweat
from
his
brow
and
answered
sullenly
they
are
worshipping
the
windlass
how
else
should
they
bring
water
into
their
fields
then
he
fell
furiously
to
digging
again
and
i
passed
on
into
the
city
there
was
no
sound
of
murmuring
streams
in
the
streets
and
down
the
main
bed
of
the
river
i
saw
only
a
few
shallow
puddles
joined
together
by
a
slowly
trickling
thread
even
these
were
fenced
and
guarded
so
that
no
one
might
come
near
to
them
and
there
were
men
going
among
to
the
houses
with
on
their
shoulders
crying
water
water
to
sell
the
marble
pools
in
the
open
square
were
empty
and
at
one
of
them
there
was
a
crowd
looking
at
a
man
who
was
being
beaten
with
rods
a
bystander
told
me
that
the
officers
of
the
city
had
ordered
him
to
be
punished
because
he
had
said
that
the
pools
and
the
basins
and
the
channels
were
not
all
of
pure
marble
without
a
flaw
for
this
said
he
is
the
evil
doctrine
that
has
come
in
to
take
away
the
glory
of
our
city
and
because
of
this
the
water
has
it
is
a
sad
change
i
answered
and
doubtless
they
who
have
caused
it
should
suffer
more
than
others
but
can
you
tell
me
at
what
hour
and
in
what
manner
the
people
now
observe
the
visitation
of
the
source
he
looked
curiously
at
me
and
replied
i
do
not
understand
you
there
is
no
visitation
save
the
inspection
of
the
cisterns
and
the
wells
which
the
syndics
of
the
city
whom
we
call
the
princes
of
water
carry
on
daily
at
every
hour
what
source
is
this
of
which
you
speak
so
i
went
on
through
the
street
where
all
the
seemed
in
haste
and
wore
weary
countenances
until
i
came
to
the
house
where
i
had
lodged
there
was
a
little
basin
here
against
the
wall
with
a
slender
stream
of
water
still
flowing
into
it
and
a
group
of
children
standing
near
with
their
pitchers
waiting
to
fill
them
the
door
of
the
house
was
closed
but
when
i
knocked
it
opened
and
a
maiden
came
forth
she
was
pale
and
sad
in
aspect
but
a
light
of
joy
dawned
over
the
snow
of
her
face
and
i
knew
by
the
youth
in
her
eyes
that
it
was
ruamie
who
had
walked
with
me
through
the
vineyards
long
ago
with
both
hands
she
welcomed
me
saying
you
are
expected
have
you
found
the
blue
flower
not
yet
i
answered
but
something
drew
me
back
to
you
i
would
know
how
it
fares
with
you
and
i
would
go
again
with
you
to
visit
the
at
this
her
face
grew
bright
but
with
a
tender
brightness
the
source
she
said
ah
yes
i
was
sure
that
you
would
remember
it
and
this
is
the
hour
of
the
visitation
come
let
us
go
up
then
we
went
alone
through
the
busy
and
weary
multitudes
of
the
city
toward
the
so
forsaken
was
it
and
so
covered
with
stones
and
overgrown
with
that
i
could
not
have
found
it
but
for
her
guidance
but
as
we
climbed
upward
the
air
grew
clearer
and
more
sweet
and
i
questioned
her
of
the
things
that
had
come
to
pass
in
my
absence
i
asked
her
of
the
kind
old
man
who
had
taken
me
into
his
house
when
i
came
as
a
stranger
she
said
softly
he
is
and
where
are
the
men
and
women
his
friends
who
once
thronged
this
pathway
are
they
also
dead
they
also
are
but
where
are
the
younger
ones
who
sang
here
so
gladly
as
they
marched
upward
surely
they
are
living
they
have
where
then
are
the
young
children
whose
fathers
taught
them
this
way
and
bade
them
remember
it
have
they
forgotten
they
have
but
why
have
you
alone
kept
the
hour
of
visitation
why
have
you
not
turned
back
with
your
companions
how
have
you
walked
here
solitary
day
after
day
she
turned
to
me
with
a
divine
regard
and
laying
her
hand
gently
over
mine
she
said
i
remember
then
i
saw
a
few
blossoming
beside
the
path
we
drew
near
to
the
source
and
entered
into
the
chamber
hewn
in
the
rock
she
kneeled
and
bent
over
the
sleeping
spring
she
murmured
again
and
again
the
beautiful
name
of
him
who
had
died
to
find
it
her
voice
repeated
the
song
that
had
once
been
sung
by
many
voices
her
tears
fell
softly
on
the
spring
and
as
they
fell
it
seemed
as
if
the
water
stirred
and
rose
to
meet
her
bending
face
and
when
she
looked
up
it
was
as
if
the
dew
had
fallen
on
a
flower
we
came
very
slowly
down
the
path
along
the
river
carita
and
rested
often
beside
it
for
surely
i
thought
the
rising
of
the
spring
had
sent
a
little
more
water
down
its
dry
bed
and
some
of
it
must
flow
on
to
the
city
so
it
was
almost
evening
when
we
came
back
to
the
streets
the
people
were
hurrying
to
and
fro
for
it
was
the
day
before
the
choosing
of
new
princes
of
water
and
there
was
much
dispute
about
them
and
strife
over
the
building
of
new
cisterns
to
hold
the
stores
of
rain
which
might
fall
in
the
next
year
but
none
cared
for
us
as
we
passed
by
like
strangers
and
we
came
unnoticed
to
the
door
of
the
house
then
a
great
desire
of
love
and
sorrow
moved
within
my
breast
and
i
said
to
ruamie
you
are
the
life
of
the
city
for
you
alone
remember
its
secret
is
in
your
heart
and
your
faithful
keeping
of
the
hours
of
visitation
is
the
only
cause
why
the
river
has
not
failed
altogether
and
the
curse
of
desolation
returned
let
me
stay
with
you
sweet
soul
of
all
the
flowers
that
are
dead
and
i
will
cherish
you
forever
together
we
will
visit
the
source
every
day
and
we
shall
turn
the
people
by
our
lives
and
by
our
words
back
to
that
which
they
have
there
was
a
smile
in
her
eyes
so
deep
that
its
meaning
can
not
be
spoken
as
she
lifted
my
hand
to
her
lips
and
answered
not
so
dear
friend
for
who
can
tell
whether
life
or
death
will
come
to
the
city
whether
its
people
will
remember
at
last
or
whether
they
will
forget
forever
its
lot
is
mine
for
i
was
born
here
and
here
my
life
is
rooted
but
you
are
of
the
children
of
the
unquiet
heart
whose
feet
can
never
rest
until
their
task
of
errors
is
completed
and
their
lesson
of
wandering
is
learned
to
the
end
until
then
go
forth
and
do
not
forget
that
i
shall
remember
behind
her
quiet
voice
i
heard
the
silent
call
that
compels
us
and
passed
down
the
street
as
one
walking
in
a
dream
at
the
place
where
the
path
turned
aside
to
the
ruined
vineyards
i
looked
back
the
low
sunset
made
a
circle
of
golden
rays
about
her
head
and
a
strange
twin
blossom
of
celestial
blue
seemed
to
shine
in
her
tranquil
eyes
since
then
i
know
not
what
has
befallen
the
city
nor
whether
it
is
still
called
saloma
or
once
more
ablis
which
is
forsaken
but
if
it
lives
at
all
i
know
that
it
is
because
there
is
one
there
who
remembers
and
keeps
the
hour
of
visitation
and
treads
the
steep
way
and
breathes
the
beautiful
name
over
the
spring
and
sometimes
i
think
that
long
before
my
seeking
and
journeying
brings
me
to
the
blue
flower
it
will
bloom
for
ruamie
beside
the
still
waters
of
the
source
the
mill
i
how
the
young
martimor
would
become
a
knight
and
assay
great
adventure
when
sir
lancelot
was
come
out
of
the
red
launds
where
he
did
many
deeds
of
arms
he
rested
him
long
with
play
and
game
in
a
land
that
is
called
beausejour
for
in
that
land
there
are
neither
castles
nor
enchantments
but
many
fair
manors
with
orchards
and
fields
lying
about
them
and
the
people
that
dwell
therein
have
good
cheer
continually
of
the
wars
and
of
the
strange
quests
that
are
ever
afoot
in
northgalis
and
lionesse
and
the
out
isles
they
hear
nothing
but
are
well
content
to
till
the
earth
in
summer
when
the
world
is
green
and
when
the
autumn
changes
green
to
gold
they
pitch
pavilions
among
the
and
the
vineyards
making
merry
with
song
and
dance
while
they
gather
harvest
of
corn
and
apples
and
grapes
and
in
the
white
days
of
winter
for
pastime
they
have
music
of
divers
instruments
and
the
playing
of
pleasant
games
but
of
the
telling
of
tales
in
that
land
there
is
little
skill
neither
do
men
rightly
understand
the
singing
of
ballads
and
romaunts
for
one
year
there
is
like
another
and
so
their
life
runs
away
and
they
leave
the
world
to
god
then
sir
lancelot
had
great
ease
for
a
time
in
this
quiet
land
and
often
he
lay
under
the
sleeping
and
again
he
taught
the
people
new
games
and
feats
of
skill
for
into
what
place
soever
he
came
he
was
welcome
though
the
inhabitants
knew
not
his
name
and
great
renown
nor
the
famous
deeds
that
he
had
done
in
tournament
and
battle
yet
for
his
own
sake
because
he
was
a
very
gentle
knight
and
full
of
courtesy
and
a
good
man
of
his
hands
withal
they
doted
upon
him
so
he
began
to
tell
them
tales
of
many
things
that
have
been
done
in
the
world
by
clean
knights
and
faithful
squires
of
the
wars
against
the
saracens
and
misbelieving
men
of
the
discomfiture
of
the
romans
when
they
came
to
take
truage
of
king
arthur
of
the
strife
with
the
eleven
kings
and
the
battle
that
was
ended
but
never
finished
of
the
questing
beast
and
how
king
pellinore
and
then
sir
palamides
followed
it
of
balin
that
gave
the
dolourous
stroke
unto
king
pellam
of
sir
tor
that
sought
the
lady
s
brachet
and
by
the
way
overcame
two
knights
and
smote
off
the
head
of
the
outrageous
caitiff
abelleus
of
these
and
many
like
matters
of
pith
and
moment
full
of
blood
and
honour
told
sir
lancelot
and
the
people
had
marvel
of
his
words
now
among
them
that
listened
to
him
gladly
was
a
youth
of
good
blood
and
breeding
very
fair
in
the
face
and
of
great
stature
his
name
was
martimor
strong
of
arm
was
he
and
his
neck
was
like
a
pillar
his
legs
were
as
tough
as
beams
of
and
in
his
heart
was
the
hunger
of
noble
tatches
and
deeds
so
when
he
heard
of
sir
lancelot
these
redoubtable
histories
he
was
taken
with
desire
to
assay
his
strength
and
he
besought
the
knight
that
they
might
joust
together
but
in
the
land
of
beausejour
there
were
no
arms
of
war
save
such
as
sir
lancelot
had
brought
with
him
wherefore
they
made
shift
to
fashion
a
harness
out
of
kitchen
gear
with
a
brazen
platter
for
a
and
the
cover
of
the
greatest
of
all
kettles
for
a
shield
and
for
a
helmet
a
round
pot
of
iron
whereof
the
handle
stuck
down
at
martimor
s
back
like
a
tail
and
for
spear
he
got
him
a
stout
young
the
point
hardened
in
the
fire
and
sir
lancelot
lent
to
him
the
sword
that
he
had
taken
from
the
false
knight
that
distressed
all
ladies
thus
was
martimor
accoutred
for
the
jousting
and
when
he
had
climbed
upon
his
horse
there
arose
much
laughter
and
mockage
sir
lancelot
laughed
a
little
though
he
was
ever
a
grave
man
and
said
now
must
we
call
this
knight
la
queue
de
fer
by
reason
of
the
tail
at
his
but
martimor
was
half
merry
and
half
wroth
and
crying
ware
he
dressed
his
spear
beneath
his
arm
right
so
he
rushed
upon
sir
lancelot
and
so
marvellously
did
his
harness
jangle
and
smite
together
as
he
came
that
the
horse
of
sir
lancelot
was
frighted
and
turned
aside
thus
the
point
of
the
caught
him
upon
the
shoulder
and
came
near
to
unhorse
him
then
martimor
drew
rein
and
shouted
ha
ha
has
done
well
nobly
hast
thou
done
said
lancelot
laughing
the
while
he
amended
his
horse
but
let
not
the
first
stroke
turn
thy
head
else
will
the
tail
of
thy
helmet
hang
down
afore
thee
and
mar
the
second
stroke
so
he
kept
his
horse
in
hand
and
guided
him
warily
making
feint
now
on
this
side
and
now
on
that
until
he
was
aware
that
the
youth
grew
hot
with
the
joy
of
fighting
and
sought
to
deal
with
him
roughly
and
bigly
then
he
cast
aside
his
spear
and
drew
sword
and
as
martimor
walloped
toward
him
he
lightly
swerved
and
with
one
stroke
cut
in
twain
the
young
so
that
not
above
an
ell
was
left
in
the
youth
s
hand
then
was
the
youth
full
of
fire
and
he
also
drew
sword
and
made
at
sir
lancelot
lashing
heavily
as
he
would
hew
down
a
tree
but
the
knight
guarded
and
warded
without
distress
until
the
other
breathed
hard
and
was
blind
with
sweat
then
lancelot
smote
him
with
a
mighty
stroke
upon
the
head
but
with
the
flat
of
his
sword
so
that
martimor
s
breath
went
clean
out
of
him
and
the
blood
gushed
from
his
mouth
and
he
fell
over
the
croup
of
his
horse
as
he
were
a
man
slain
then
sir
lancelot
laughed
no
more
but
grieved
for
he
weened
that
he
had
harmed
the
youth
and
he
liked
him
passing
well
so
he
ran
to
him
and
held
him
in
his
arms
fast
and
tended
him
and
when
the
breath
came
again
into
his
body
lancelot
was
glad
and
desired
the
youth
that
he
would
pardon
him
of
that
unequal
joust
and
of
the
stroke
too
heavy
at
this
martimor
sat
up
and
took
him
by
the
hand
pardon
he
cried
no
talk
of
pardon
between
thee
and
me
my
lord
lancelot
thou
hast
given
me
such
joy
of
my
life
as
never
i
had
before
it
made
me
glad
to
feel
thy
might
and
now
am
i
delibred
and
fully
concluded
that
i
also
will
become
a
knight
and
thou
shalt
instruct
me
how
and
in
what
land
i
shall
seek
great
ii
how
martimor
was
instructed
of
sir
lancelot
to
set
forth
upon
his
quest
so
right
gladly
did
sir
lancelot
advise
the
young
martimor
of
all
the
customs
and
vows
of
the
noble
order
of
knighthood
and
shew
how
he
might
become
a
and
a
hardy
knight
to
win
good
fame
and
renown
for
between
these
two
from
the
first
there
was
close
brotherhood
and
affiance
though
in
years
and
in
breeding
they
were
so
far
apart
and
this
brotherhood
endured
until
the
last
as
ye
shall
see
nor
was
the
affiance
broken
thus
willingly
learned
the
youth
of
his
master
being
instructed
first
in
the
art
and
craft
to
manage
and
guide
a
horse
then
to
handle
the
shield
and
the
spear
and
both
to
cut
and
to
foin
with
the
sword
and
last
of
all
in
the
laws
of
honour
and
courtesy
whereby
a
man
may
rule
his
own
spirit
and
so
obtain
grace
of
god
praise
of
princes
and
favour
of
fair
ladies
for
this
i
tell
thee
said
sir
lancelot
as
they
sat
together
under
an
there
be
many
good
fighters
that
are
false
knights
breaking
faith
with
man
and
woman
envious
lustful
and
orgulous
in
them
courage
is
cruel
and
love
is
lecherous
and
in
the
end
they
shall
come
to
shame
and
shall
be
overcome
by
a
simpler
knight
than
themselves
or
else
they
shall
win
sorrow
and
despite
by
the
slaying
of
better
men
than
they
be
and
with
their
paramours
they
shall
have
weary
dole
and
distress
of
soul
and
body
for
he
that
is
false
to
him
shall
none
be
true
but
all
things
shall
be
unhappy
about
but
how
and
if
a
man
be
true
in
heart
said
martimor
yet
by
some
enchantment
or
evil
fortune
he
may
do
an
ill
deed
and
one
that
is
harmful
to
his
lord
or
to
his
friend
even
as
balin
and
his
brother
balan
slew
each
the
other
unknown
that
is
in
god
s
hand
said
lancelot
doubtless
he
may
pardon
and
assoil
all
such
in
their
unhappiness
forasmuch
as
the
secret
of
it
is
with
and
how
if
a
man
be
entangled
in
love
said
martimor
yet
his
love
be
set
upon
one
that
is
not
lawful
for
him
to
have
for
either
he
must
deny
his
love
which
is
great
shame
or
else
he
must
do
dishonour
to
the
law
what
shall
he
then
do
at
this
sir
lancelot
was
silent
and
heaved
a
great
sigh
then
said
he
rest
assured
that
this
man
shall
have
sorrow
enough
for
out
of
this
net
he
may
not
escape
save
by
falsehood
on
the
one
side
or
by
treachery
on
the
other
therefore
say
i
that
he
shall
not
assay
to
escape
but
rather
right
manfully
to
bear
the
bonds
with
which
he
is
bound
and
to
do
honour
to
how
may
this
be
said
martimor
by
clean
living
said
lancelot
and
by
keeping
himself
from
wine
which
heats
the
blood
and
by
quests
and
labours
and
combats
wherein
the
fierceness
of
the
heart
is
spent
and
overcome
and
by
inward
joy
in
the
pure
worship
of
his
lady
whereat
none
may
take
how
then
shall
a
man
bear
himself
in
the
following
of
a
quest
said
martimor
shall
he
set
his
face
ever
forward
and
turn
not
to
right
or
left
whatever
meet
him
by
the
way
or
shall
he
hold
himself
ready
to
answer
them
that
call
to
him
and
to
succour
them
that
ask
help
of
him
and
to
turn
aside
from
his
path
for
rescue
and
good
service
enough
of
questions
said
lancelot
these
are
things
whereto
each
man
must
answer
for
himself
and
not
for
other
true
knight
taketh
counsel
of
the
time
every
day
his
own
deed
and
the
winning
of
a
quest
is
not
by
haste
nor
by
hap
but
what
needs
to
be
done
that
must
ye
do
while
ye
are
in
the
then
because
of
the
love
that
sir
lancelot
bore
to
martimor
he
gave
him
his
own
armour
and
the
good
spear
wherewith
he
had
unhorsed
many
knights
and
the
sword
that
he
took
from
sir
peris
de
forest
savage
that
distressed
all
ladies
but
his
shield
he
gave
not
for
therein
his
own
remembrance
was
blazoned
so
he
let
make
a
new
shield
and
in
the
corner
was
painted
a
blue
flower
that
was
nameless
and
this
he
gave
to
martimor
saying
thou
shalt
name
it
when
thou
hast
found
it
and
so
shalt
thou
have
both
crest
and
now
am
i
well
beseen
cried
martimor
and
my
adventures
are
before
me
which
way
shall
i
ride
and
where
shall
i
find
them
ride
into
the
wind
said
lancelot
and
what
chance
soever
it
blows
thee
thereby
do
thy
best
as
it
were
the
first
and
the
last
take
not
thy
hand
from
it
until
it
be
fulfilled
so
shalt
thou
most
quickly
and
worthily
achieve
then
they
embraced
like
brothers
and
each
bade
other
keep
him
well
and
sir
lancelot
in
leather
jerkin
with
naked
head
but
with
his
shield
and
sword
rode
to
the
south
toward
camelot
and
martimor
rode
into
the
wind
westward
over
the
hill
iii
how
martimor
came
to
the
mill
a
stayed
in
a
delay
so
by
wildsome
ways
in
strange
countries
and
through
many
waters
and
valleys
rode
martimor
forty
days
but
adventure
met
him
none
blow
the
wind
never
so
fierce
or
fickle
neither
dragons
nor
giants
nor
false
knights
nor
distressed
ladies
nor
fays
nor
kings
imprisoned
could
he
find
these
are
ill
times
for
adventure
said
he
the
world
is
full
of
meat
and
sleepy
now
must
i
ride
farther
afield
and
undertake
some
ancient
famous
quest
wherein
other
knights
have
failed
and
fallen
either
i
shall
follow
the
questing
beast
with
sir
palamides
or
i
shall
find
merlin
at
the
great
stone
whereunder
the
lady
of
the
lake
enchanted
him
and
deliver
him
from
that
enchantment
or
i
shall
assay
the
cleansing
of
the
forest
perilous
or
i
shall
win
the
favour
of
la
belle
dame
sans
merci
or
mayhap
i
shall
adventure
the
quest
of
the
sangreal
one
or
other
of
these
will
i
achieve
or
bleed
the
best
blood
of
my
thus
pondering
and
dreaming
he
came
by
the
road
down
a
gentle
hill
with
close
woods
on
either
hand
and
so
into
a
valley
with
a
swift
river
flowing
through
it
and
on
the
river
a
mill
so
white
it
stood
among
the
trees
and
so
merrily
whirred
the
wheel
as
the
water
turned
it
and
so
bright
blossomed
the
flowers
in
the
garden
that
martimor
had
joy
of
the
sight
for
it
minded
him
of
his
own
country
but
here
is
no
adventure
thought
he
and
made
to
ride
by
even
then
came
a
young
maid
suddenly
through
the
garden
crying
and
wringing
her
hands
and
when
she
saw
him
she
cried
him
help
at
this
martimor
alighted
quickly
and
ran
into
the
garden
where
the
young
maid
soon
led
him
to
the
millpond
which
was
great
and
deep
and
made
him
understand
that
her
little
hound
was
swept
away
by
the
water
and
was
near
to
perishing
there
saw
he
a
red
and
white
brachet
caught
by
the
swift
stream
that
ran
into
the
race
fast
swimming
as
ever
he
could
swim
yet
by
no
means
able
to
escape
then
martimor
stripped
off
his
harness
and
leaped
into
the
water
and
did
marvellously
to
rescue
the
little
hound
but
the
fierce
river
dragged
his
legs
and
buffeted
him
and
hurtled
at
him
and
drew
him
down
as
it
were
an
enemy
wrestling
with
him
so
that
he
had
much
ado
to
come
where
the
brachet
was
and
more
to
win
back
again
with
the
brachet
in
his
arm
to
the
dry
land
which
when
he
had
done
he
was
clean
and
fell
upon
the
ground
as
a
dead
man
at
this
the
young
maid
wept
yet
more
bitterly
than
she
had
wept
for
her
hound
and
cried
aloud
alas
if
so
goodly
a
man
should
spend
his
life
for
my
little
brachet
so
she
took
his
head
upon
her
knee
and
cherished
him
and
beat
the
palms
of
his
hands
and
the
hound
licked
his
face
and
when
martimor
opened
his
eyes
he
saw
the
face
of
the
maid
that
it
was
fair
as
any
flower
then
was
she
shamed
and
put
him
gently
from
her
knee
and
began
to
thank
him
and
to
ask
with
what
she
might
reward
him
for
the
saving
of
the
brachet
a
night
s
lodging
and
a
day
s
cheer
quoth
martimor
as
long
as
thee
liketh
said
she
for
my
father
the
miller
will
return
ere
sundown
and
right
gladly
will
he
have
a
guest
so
longer
might
i
like
said
he
but
longer
may
i
not
stay
for
i
ride
in
a
quest
and
seek
great
adventures
to
become
a
so
they
bestowed
the
horse
in
the
stable
and
went
into
the
mill
and
when
the
miller
was
come
home
they
had
such
good
cheer
with
eating
of
venison
and
and
drinking
of
hydromel
and
singing
of
pleasant
ballads
that
martimor
clean
forgot
he
was
in
a
delay
and
going
to
his
bed
in
a
fair
garret
he
dreamed
of
the
maid
of
the
mill
whose
name
was
lirette
iv
how
the
mill
was
in
danger
and
the
delay
endured
in
the
morning
martimor
lay
late
and
thought
large
thoughts
of
his
quest
and
whither
it
might
lead
him
and
to
what
honour
it
should
bring
him
as
he
dreamed
thus
suddenly
he
heard
in
the
hall
below
a
trampling
of
feet
and
a
shouting
with
the
voice
of
lirette
crying
and
shrieking
with
that
he
sprang
out
of
his
bed
and
caught
up
his
sword
and
dagger
leaping
lightly
and
fiercely
down
the
stair
there
he
saw
three
foul
churls
whereof
two
strove
with
the
miller
beating
him
with
great
clubs
while
the
third
would
master
the
maid
and
drag
her
away
to
do
her
shame
but
she
fought
shrewdly
then
martimor
rushed
upon
the
churls
shouting
for
joy
and
there
was
a
great
medley
of
breaking
chairs
and
tables
and
cursing
and
smiting
and
with
his
sword
he
gave
horrible
strokes
one
of
the
knaves
that
fought
with
the
miller
he
smote
upon
the
shoulder
and
clave
him
to
the
navel
and
at
the
other
he
foined
fiercely
so
that
the
point
of
the
sword
went
through
his
back
and
stuck
fast
in
the
wall
but
the
third
knave
that
was
the
biggest
and
the
blackest
and
strove
to
bear
away
the
maid
left
bold
of
her
and
leaped
upon
martimor
and
caught
him
by
the
middle
and
crushed
him
so
that
his
ribs
cracked
thus
they
weltered
and
wrung
together
and
now
one
of
them
was
above
and
now
the
other
and
ever
as
they
wallowed
martimor
smote
him
with
his
dagger
but
there
came
forth
no
blood
only
water
then
the
black
churl
broke
away
from
him
and
ran
out
at
the
door
of
the
mill
and
martimor
after
so
they
ran
through
the
garden
to
the
river
and
there
the
churl
sprang
into
the
water
and
swept
away
raging
and
foaming
and
as
he
went
he
shouted
yet
will
i
put
thee
to
the
worse
and
mar
the
mill
and
have
the
maid
then
martimor
cried
never
while
i
live
shalt
thou
mar
the
mill
or
have
the
maid
thou
foul
black
misbegotten
churl
so
he
returned
to
the
mill
and
there
the
damsel
lirette
made
him
to
understand
that
these
three
churls
were
long
time
enemies
of
the
mill
and
sought
ever
to
destroy
it
and
to
do
despite
to
her
and
her
father
one
of
them
was
ignis
and
another
was
ventus
and
these
were
the
twain
that
he
had
smitten
but
the
third
that
fled
down
the
river
and
he
was
ever
the
fiercest
and
the
most
outrageous
his
name
was
flumen
for
he
dwelt
in
the
caves
of
the
stream
and
was
the
master
of
it
before
the
mill
was
built
and
now
wept
the
maid
he
must
have
had
his
will
with
me
and
with
the
mill
but
for
god
s
mercy
thanked
be
our
lord
jesus
thank
me
too
said
mlartimor
so
i
do
said
lirette
and
she
kissed
him
yet
am
i
heavy
at
heart
and
fearful
for
my
father
is
sorely
mishandled
and
his
arm
is
broken
so
that
he
can
not
tend
the
mill
nor
guard
it
and
flumen
is
escaped
surely
he
will
harm
us
again
now
i
know
not
where
i
shall
look
for
why
not
here
said
martimor
then
lirette
looked
him
in
the
face
smiling
a
little
sorrily
but
thou
ridest
in
a
quest
quoth
she
thou
mayst
not
stay
from
thy
a
month
said
he
till
my
father
be
well
said
she
a
month
said
he
till
thou
hast
put
flumen
to
the
worse
said
she
right
willingly
would
i
have
to
do
with
that
base
slippery
knave
again
said
he
but
more
than
a
month
i
may
not
stay
for
my
quest
calls
me
and
i
must
win
worship
of
men
or
ever
i
become
a
so
they
bound
up
the
miller
s
wounds
and
set
the
mill
in
order
but
martimor
had
much
to
do
to
learn
the
working
of
the
mill
and
they
were
busied
with
the
grinding
of
wheat
and
rye
and
barley
and
divers
kinds
of
grain
and
the
millers
hurts
were
mended
every
day
and
at
night
there
was
merry
rest
and
good
cheer
and
martimor
talked
with
the
maid
of
the
great
adventure
that
he
must
find
and
thus
the
delay
endured
in
pleasant
wise
the
mill
v
yet
more
of
the
mill
and
of
the
same
delay
also
of
the
maid
now
at
the
end
of
the
third
month
which
was
november
martimor
made
lirette
to
understand
that
it
was
high
time
he
should
ride
farther
to
follow
his
quest
for
the
miller
was
now
recovered
and
it
was
long
that
they
had
heard
and
seen
naught
of
flumen
and
doubtless
that
black
knave
was
well
routed
and
dismayed
that
he
would
not
come
again
lirette
prayed
him
and
desired
him
that
he
would
tarry
yet
one
week
but
martimor
said
no
for
his
adventures
were
before
him
and
that
he
could
not
be
happy
save
in
the
doing
of
great
deeds
and
the
winning
of
knightly
fame
then
he
showed
her
the
blue
flower
in
his
shield
that
was
nameless
and
told
her
how
sir
lancelot
had
said
that
he
must
find
it
then
should
he
name
it
and
have
both
crest
and
motto
does
it
grow
in
my
garden
said
lirette
i
have
not
seen
it
said
he
and
now
the
flowers
are
all
perhaps
in
the
month
of
may
said
she
in
that
month
i
will
come
again
said
he
for
by
that
time
it
may
fortune
that
i
shall
achieve
my
quest
but
now
forth
must
i
so
there
was
sad
cheer
in
the
mill
that
day
and
at
night
there
came
a
fierce
storm
with
howling
wind
and
plumping
rain
and
martimor
slept
about
the
break
of
day
he
was
wakened
by
a
great
roaring
and
pounding
then
he
looked
out
of
window
and
saw
the
river
in
flood
with
black
waves
spuming
and
raving
like
wood
beasts
and
driving
before
them
great
logs
and
broken
trees
thus
the
river
hurled
and
hammered
at
the
so
that
it
trembled
and
the
logs
leaped
as
they
would
spring
over
it
and
the
voice
of
flumen
shouted
hoarsely
and
hungrily
yet
will
i
mar
the
mill
and
have
the
maid
then
martimor
ran
with
the
miller
out
upon
the
dam
and
they
laboured
at
the
gates
that
held
the
river
back
and
thrust
away
the
logs
that
were
heaped
over
them
and
cut
with
axes
and
fought
with
the
river
so
at
last
two
of
the
gates
were
lifted
and
one
was
broken
and
the
flood
ran
down
ramping
and
roaring
in
great
raundon
and
as
it
ran
the
black
face
of
flumen
sprang
above
it
crying
yet
will
i
mar
both
mill
and
that
shalt
thou
never
do
cried
martimor
by
foul
or
fair
while
the
life
beats
in
my
so
he
came
back
with
the
miller
into
the
mill
and
there
was
meat
ready
for
them
and
they
ate
strongly
and
with
good
heart
now
said
the
miller
must
i
mend
the
gate
but
how
it
may
be
done
i
know
not
for
surely
this
will
be
great
travail
for
a
man
why
alone
said
martimor
thou
wilt
stay
then
said
lirette
yea
said
he
for
another
month
said
she
till
the
gate
be
mended
said
he
but
when
the
gate
was
mended
there
came
another
flood
and
brake
the
second
gate
and
when
that
was
mended
there
came
another
flood
and
brake
the
third
gate
so
when
all
three
were
mended
firm
and
fast
being
bound
with
iron
still
the
grimly
river
hurled
over
the
dam
and
the
voice
of
flumen
muttered
in
the
dark
of
winter
nights
yet
will
i
mar
mar
mar
yet
will
i
mar
mill
and
oho
said
martimor
this
is
a
durable
and
dogged
knave
art
thou
feared
of
him
lirette
not
so
said
she
for
thou
art
stronger
but
fear
have
i
of
the
day
when
thou
ridest
forth
in
thy
well
as
to
that
said
he
when
i
have
overcome
this
false
devil
flumen
then
will
we
consider
and
appoint
that
so
the
delay
continued
and
martimor
was
both
busy
and
happy
at
the
mill
for
he
liked
and
loved
this
damsel
well
and
was
fain
of
her
company
moreover
the
strife
with
flumen
was
great
joy
to
him
vi
how
the
month
of
may
came
to
the
mill
and
the
delay
was
made
longer
now
when
the
month
of
may
came
to
the
mill
it
brought
a
plenty
of
sweet
flowers
and
lirette
wrought
in
the
garden
with
her
when
the
day
was
spent
and
the
sun
rested
upon
the
edge
of
the
hill
went
martimor
and
she
showed
him
all
her
flowers
that
were
blue
but
none
of
them
was
like
the
flower
on
his
shield
is
it
this
she
cried
giving
him
a
violet
too
dark
said
he
then
here
it
is
she
said
plucking
a
posy
of
too
light
said
he
surely
this
is
it
and
she
brought
him
a
spray
of
too
slender
said
he
and
well
i
ween
that
i
may
not
find
that
flower
till
i
ride
farther
in
my
quest
and
achieve
great
then
was
the
maid
cast
down
and
martimor
was
fain
to
comfort
her
so
while
they
walked
thus
in
the
garden
the
days
were
fair
and
still
and
the
river
ran
lowly
and
slowly
as
it
were
full
of
gentleness
and
flumen
had
amended
him
of
his
evil
ways
but
full
of
craft
and
guile
was
that
false
foe
for
now
that
the
gates
were
firm
and
strong
he
found
a
way
down
through
the
corner
of
the
dam
where
a
had
burrowed
and
there
the
water
went
seeping
and
creeping
gnawing
ever
at
the
hidden
breach
presently
in
the
night
came
a
mizzling
rain
and
far
among
the
hills
a
cloud
brake
open
and
the
flowed
over
and
under
and
the
dam
crumbled
away
and
the
mill
shook
and
the
whole
river
ran
roaring
through
the
garden
then
was
martimor
wonderly
wroth
because
the
river
had
blotted
out
the
maid
s
flowers
and
one
day
she
cried
holding
fast
to
him
and
trembling
one
day
flumen
will
have
me
when
thou
art
not
so
said
he
by
the
faith
of
my
body
that
foul
fiend
shall
never
have
thee
i
will
bind
him
i
will
compel
him
or
die
in
the
so
he
went
forth
upward
along
the
river
till
he
came
to
a
strait
place
among
the
hills
there
was
a
great
rock
full
of
caves
and
hollows
and
there
the
water
whirled
and
burbled
in
furious
wise
here
thought
he
is
the
hold
of
the
knave
flumen
and
if
i
may
cut
through
above
this
rock
and
make
a
dyke
with
a
gate
in
it
to
let
down
the
water
another
way
when
the
floods
come
so
shall
i
spoil
him
of
his
craft
and
put
him
to
the
then
he
toiled
day
and
night
to
make
the
dyke
and
ever
by
night
flumen
came
and
strove
with
him
and
did
his
power
to
cast
him
down
and
strangle
him
but
martimor
stood
fast
and
drave
him
back
and
at
last
as
they
wrestled
and
whapped
together
they
fell
headlong
in
the
stream
shouted
flumen
now
will
i
drown
thee
and
mar
the
mill
and
the
but
martimor
gripped
him
by
the
neck
and
thrust
his
head
betwixt
the
leaves
of
the
gate
and
shut
them
fast
so
that
his
eyes
stood
out
like
gobbets
of
foam
and
his
black
tongue
hung
from
his
mouth
like
a
now
shalt
thou
swear
never
to
mar
mill
nor
maid
but
meekly
to
serve
them
cried
martimor
then
flumen
sware
by
wind
and
wave
by
storm
and
stream
by
rain
and
river
by
pond
and
pool
by
flood
and
fountain
by
dyke
and
dam
these
be
changeable
things
said
martimor
swear
by
the
name
of
so
he
sware
and
even
as
the
name
passed
his
teeth
the
gobbets
of
foam
floated
forth
from
the
gate
and
the
writhed
away
with
the
stream
and
the
river
flowed
fair
and
softly
with
a
sound
like
singing
then
martimor
came
back
to
the
mill
and
told
how
flumen
was
overcome
and
made
to
swear
a
pact
thus
their
hearts
waxed
light
and
jolly
and
they
kept
that
day
as
it
were
a
vii
how
martimor
bled
for
a
lady
and
lived
for
a
maid
and
how
his
great
adventure
ended
and
began
at
the
mill
now
leave
we
of
the
mill
and
martimor
and
the
maid
and
let
us
speak
of
a
certain
lady
passing
tall
and
fair
and
young
this
was
the
lady
beauvivante
that
was
daughter
to
king
pellinore
and
three
false
knights
took
her
by
craft
from
her
father
s
court
and
led
her
away
to
work
their
will
on
her
but
she
escaped
from
them
as
they
slept
by
a
well
and
came
riding
on
a
white
palfrey
over
hill
and
dale
as
fast
as
ever
she
could
drive
thus
she
came
to
the
mill
and
her
palfrey
was
spent
and
there
she
took
refuge
beseeching
martimor
that
he
would
hide
her
and
defend
her
from
those
caitiff
knights
that
must
soon
follow
of
hiding
said
he
will
i
hear
naught
but
of
defending
am
i
full
fain
for
this
have
i
then
he
made
ready
his
horse
and
his
armour
and
took
both
spear
and
sword
and
stood
forth
in
the
bridge
now
this
bridge
was
strait
so
that
none
could
pass
there
but
singly
and
that
not
till
martimor
yielded
or
was
beaten
down
then
came
the
three
knights
that
followed
the
lady
riding
fiercely
down
the
hill
and
when
they
came
about
ten
from
the
bridge
they
halted
and
stood
still
as
it
had
been
a
plump
of
wood
one
rode
in
black
and
one
rode
in
yellow
and
the
third
rode
in
black
and
yellow
so
they
cried
martimor
that
he
should
give
them
passage
for
they
followed
a
quest
passage
takes
who
passage
makes
cried
martimor
right
well
i
know
your
quest
and
it
is
a
foul
then
the
knight
in
black
rode
at
him
lightly
but
martimor
encountered
him
with
the
spear
and
smote
him
backward
from
his
horse
that
his
head
struck
the
coping
of
the
bridge
and
brake
his
neck
then
came
the
knight
in
yellow
walloping
heavily
and
him
the
spear
pierced
through
the
midst
of
the
body
and
burst
in
three
pieces
so
he
fell
on
his
back
and
the
life
went
out
of
him
but
the
spear
stuck
fast
and
stood
up
from
his
breast
as
a
stake
then
the
knight
in
black
and
yellow
that
was
as
big
as
both
his
brethren
gave
a
terrible
shout
and
rode
at
martimor
like
a
wood
lion
but
he
fended
with
his
shield
that
the
spear
went
aside
and
they
clapped
together
like
thunder
and
both
horses
were
overthrown
and
lightly
they
avoided
their
horses
and
rushed
together
tracing
rasing
and
foining
such
strokes
they
gave
that
great
pieces
were
clipped
away
from
their
hauberks
and
their
helms
and
they
staggered
to
and
fro
like
drunken
men
then
they
hurtled
together
like
rams
and
each
battered
other
the
wind
out
of
his
body
so
they
sat
either
on
one
side
of
the
bridge
to
take
their
breath
glaring
the
one
at
the
other
as
two
owls
then
they
stepped
together
and
fought
freshly
smiting
and
thrusting
ramping
and
reeling
panting
snorting
and
scattering
blood
for
the
space
of
two
hours
so
the
knight
in
black
and
yellow
because
he
was
heavier
drave
martimor
backward
step
by
step
till
he
came
to
the
crown
of
the
bridge
and
there
fell
grovelling
at
this
the
lady
beauvivante
shrieked
and
wailed
but
the
damsel
lirette
cried
loudly
up
martimor
strike
again
then
the
courage
came
into
his
body
and
with
a
great
might
he
abraid
upon
his
feet
and
smote
the
black
and
yellow
knight
upon
the
helm
by
an
overstroke
so
fierce
that
the
sword
sheared
away
the
third
part
of
his
head
as
it
had
been
a
rotten
cheese
so
he
lay
upon
the
bridge
and
the
blood
ran
out
of
him
and
martimor
smote
off
the
rest
of
his
head
quite
and
cast
it
into
the
river
likewise
did
he
with
the
other
twain
that
lay
dead
beyond
the
bridge
and
he
cried
to
flumen
hide
me
these
black
eggs
that
hatched
evil
so
the
river
bore
them
away
then
martimor
came
into
the
mill
all
now
are
ye
free
lady
he
cried
and
fell
down
in
a
swoon
then
the
lady
and
the
maid
wept
full
sore
and
made
great
dole
and
unlaced
his
helm
and
lirette
cherished
him
tenderly
to
recover
his
life
so
while
they
were
thus
busied
and
distressed
came
sir
lancelot
with
a
great
company
of
knights
and
squires
riding
for
to
rescue
the
princess
when
he
came
to
the
bridge
all
bedashed
with
blood
and
the
bodies
of
the
knights
headless
now
by
my
lady
s
name
said
he
here
has
been
good
fighting
and
those
three
caitiffs
are
slain
by
whose
hand
i
wonder
so
he
came
into
the
mill
and
there
he
found
martimor
recovered
of
his
swoon
and
had
marvellous
joy
of
him
when
he
heard
how
he
had
wrought
now
are
thou
proven
worthy
of
the
noble
order
of
knighthood
said
lancelot
and
forthwith
he
dubbed
him
knight
then
he
said
that
sir
martimor
should
ride
with
him
to
the
court
of
king
pellinore
to
receive
a
castle
and
a
fair
lady
to
wife
for
doubtless
the
king
would
deny
him
nothing
to
reward
the
rescue
of
his
daughter
but
martimor
stood
in
a
muse
then
said
he
may
a
knight
have
his
free
will
and
choice
of
castles
where
he
will
abide
within
the
law
said
lancelot
and
by
the
king
s
word
he
then
choose
i
the
mill
said
martimor
for
here
will
i
freely
spoken
said
lancelot
laughing
so
art
thou
sir
martimor
of
the
mill
no
doubt
the
king
will
confirm
it
and
now
what
sayest
thou
of
ladies
may
a
knight
have
his
free
will
and
choice
here
also
said
he
according
to
his
fortune
said
lancelot
and
by
the
lady
s
favour
he
well
then
said
sir
martimor
taking
lirette
by
the
hand
this
maid
is
to
me
liefer
to
have
and
to
wield
as
my
wife
than
any
dame
or
princess
that
is
what
brother
said
sir
lancelot
is
the
wind
in
that
quarter
and
will
the
maid
have
thee
i
will
well
said
lirette
now
are
you
well
provided
said
sir
lancelot
with
knighthood
and
a
castle
and
a
lady
lacks
but
a
motto
and
a
name
for
the
blue
flower
in
thy
he
that
names
it
shall
never
find
it
said
sir
martimor
and
he
that
finds
it
needs
no
so
lirette
rejoiced
sir
martimor
and
loved
together
during
their
and
this
is
the
end
and
the
beginning
of
the
story
of
the
mill
spy
rock
i
it
must
have
been
near
sutherland
s
pond
that
i
lost
the
way
for
there
the
deserted
road
which
i
had
been
following
through
the
highlands
ran
out
upon
a
meadow
all
abloom
with
purple
and
golden
s
wort
the
declining
sun
cast
a
glory
over
the
lonely
field
and
far
in
the
corner
nigh
to
the
woods
there
was
a
touch
of
the
celestial
colour
blue
of
the
sky
seen
between
white
clouds
blue
of
the
sea
shimmering
through
faint
drifts
of
silver
mist
the
hope
of
finding
that
hue
of
distance
and
mystery
embodied
in
a
living
form
the
old
hope
of
discovering
the
blue
flower
rose
again
in
my
heart
but
it
was
only
for
a
moment
for
when
i
came
nearer
i
saw
that
the
colour
which
had
caught
my
eye
came
from
a
multitude
of
closed
gentians
the
blossoms
which
never
open
into
perfection
growing
so
closely
together
that
their
blended
promise
had
seemed
like
a
single
flower
so
i
harked
back
again
slanting
across
the
meadow
to
find
the
road
but
it
had
vanished
wandering
among
the
alders
and
clumps
of
gray
birches
here
and
there
i
found
a
track
that
looked
like
it
but
as
i
tried
each
one
it
grew
more
faint
and
uncertain
and
at
last
came
to
nothing
in
a
thicket
or
a
marsh
while
i
was
thus
beating
about
the
bush
the
sun
dropped
below
the
western
rim
of
hills
it
was
necessary
to
make
the
most
of
the
lingering
light
if
i
did
not
wish
to
be
benighted
in
the
woods
the
little
village
of
canterbury
which
was
the
goal
of
my
day
s
march
must
lie
about
to
the
north
just
beyond
the
edge
of
the
mountain
and
in
that
direction
i
turned
pushing
forward
as
rapidly
as
possible
through
the
undergrowth
presently
i
came
into
a
region
where
the
trees
were
larger
and
the
travelling
was
easier
it
was
not
a
primeval
forest
but
a
second
growth
of
chestnuts
and
poplars
and
maples
through
the
woods
there
ran
at
intervals
long
lines
of
broken
rock
covered
with
moss
the
ruins
evidently
of
ancient
stone
fences
the
land
must
have
been
in
former
days
a
farm
inhabited
cultivated
the
home
of
human
hopes
and
desires
and
labours
but
now
relapsed
into
solitude
and
wilderness
what
could
the
life
have
been
among
these
rugged
and
inhospitable
highlands
on
this
niggard
and
reluctant
soil
where
was
the
house
that
once
sheltered
the
tillers
of
this
rude
corner
of
the
earth
here
perhaps
in
the
little
clearing
into
which
i
now
emerged
a
couple
of
decrepit
grew
on
the
edge
of
it
and
dropped
their
scanty
and
gnarled
fruit
to
feast
the
squirrels
a
little
farther
on
a
straggling
clump
of
ancient
lilacs
a
bewildered
old
bush
of
sweetbrier
the
leaves
of
a
cluster
of
long
past
blooming
marked
the
grave
of
the
garden
and
here
above
this
square
hollow
in
the
earth
with
the
remains
of
a
crumbling
chimney
standing
sentinel
beside
it
here
the
house
must
have
stood
what
joys
what
sorrows
once
centred
around
this
cold
and
desolate
what
children
went
forth
like
birds
from
this
dismantled
nest
into
the
wide
world
what
guests
found
refuge
take
care
stand
back
there
is
a
rattlesnake
in
the
old
the
voice
even
more
than
the
words
startled
me
i
drew
away
suddenly
and
saw
behind
the
ruins
of
the
chimney
a
man
of
an
aspect
so
striking
that
to
this
day
his
face
and
figure
are
as
vivid
in
my
memory
as
if
it
were
but
yesterday
that
i
had
met
him
he
was
dressed
in
black
the
coat
of
a
somewhat
formal
cut
a
long
cravat
loosely
knotted
in
his
rolling
collar
his
head
was
bare
and
the
hair
thick
and
waving
was
in
some
disorder
his
face
smooth
and
pale
with
high
forehead
straight
nose
and
thin
sensitive
lips
was
it
old
or
young
handsome
it
certainly
was
the
face
of
a
man
of
mark
a
man
of
power
yet
there
was
something
strange
and
wild
about
it
his
dark
eyes
with
the
fine
wrinkles
about
them
had
a
look
of
unspeakable
remoteness
and
at
the
same
time
an
intensity
that
seemed
to
pierce
me
through
and
through
it
was
as
if
he
saw
me
in
a
dream
yet
measured
me
weighed
me
with
a
scrutiny
as
exact
as
it
was
at
bottom
indifferent
but
his
lips
were
smiling
and
there
was
no
fault
to
be
found
at
least
with
his
manner
he
had
risen
from
the
broad
stone
where
he
had
evidently
been
sitting
with
his
back
against
the
chimney
and
came
forward
to
greet
me
you
will
pardon
the
abruptness
of
my
greeting
i
thought
you
might
not
care
to
make
acquaintance
with
the
present
tenant
of
this
old
house
at
least
not
without
an
certainly
not
i
answered
you
have
done
me
a
real
kindness
which
is
better
than
the
outward
form
of
courtesy
but
how
is
it
that
you
stay
at
such
close
quarters
with
this
unpleasant
tenant
have
you
no
fear
of
him
not
the
least
in
the
world
he
answered
laughing
i
know
the
snakes
too
well
better
than
they
know
themselves
it
is
not
likely
that
even
an
old
serpent
with
thirteen
rattles
like
this
one
could
harm
me
i
know
his
ways
before
he
could
strike
i
should
be
out
of
well
said
i
it
is
a
grim
thought
at
all
events
that
this
house
once
a
cheerful
home
no
doubt
should
have
fallen
at
last
to
be
the
dwelling
of
such
a
vile
fallen
he
exclaimed
then
he
repeated
the
word
with
a
questioning
accent
fallen
are
you
sure
of
that
the
snake
in
his
way
may
be
quite
as
honest
as
the
people
who
lived
here
before
him
and
not
much
more
harmful
the
farmer
was
a
miser
who
robbed
his
mother
quarrelled
with
his
brother
and
starved
his
wife
what
she
lacked
in
food
she
made
up
in
drink
when
she
could
one
of
the
children
a
girl
was
a
cripple
lamed
by
her
mother
in
a
fit
of
rage
the
two
boys
were
ne
who
ran
away
from
home
as
soon
as
they
were
old
enough
one
of
them
is
serving
a
in
the
state
prison
for
manslaughter
when
the
house
burned
down
some
thirty
years
ago
the
woman
escaped
the
man
s
body
was
found
with
the
head
crushed
in
perhaps
by
a
falling
timber
the
family
of
our
friend
the
rattlesnake
could
hardly
surpass
that
record
i
think
but
why
should
we
blame
them
any
of
them
they
were
only
acting
out
their
natures
to
one
who
can
see
and
understand
it
is
all
perfectly
simple
and
interesting
immensely
it
is
impossible
to
describe
the
quiet
eagerness
the
cool
glow
of
fervour
with
which
he
narrated
this
little
history
it
was
the
manner
of
the
triumphant
pathologist
who
lays
bare
some
hidden
seat
of
disease
it
surprised
and
repelled
me
a
little
yet
it
attracted
me
too
for
i
could
see
how
evidently
he
counted
on
my
comprehension
and
sympathy
well
said
i
it
is
a
pitiful
history
rural
life
is
not
all
peace
and
innocence
but
how
came
you
to
know
the
story
i
oh
i
make
it
my
business
to
know
a
little
of
everything
and
as
much
as
possible
of
human
life
not
excepting
the
petty
chronicles
of
the
rustics
around
me
it
is
my
chief
pleasure
i
earn
my
living
by
teaching
boys
i
find
my
satisfaction
in
studying
men
but
you
are
on
a
journey
sir
and
night
is
falling
i
must
not
detain
you
or
perhaps
you
will
allow
me
to
forward
you
a
little
by
serving
as
a
guide
which
way
were
you
going
when
you
turned
aside
to
look
at
this
dismantled
shrine
to
canterbury
i
answered
to
find
a
night
s
or
a
month
s
lodging
at
the
inn
my
journey
is
a
ramble
it
has
neither
terminus
nor
then
let
me
commend
to
you
something
vastly
better
than
the
tender
mercies
of
the
canterbury
inn
come
with
me
to
the
school
on
hilltop
where
i
am
a
teacher
it
is
a
thousand
feet
above
the
village
purer
air
finer
view
and
pleasanter
company
there
is
plenty
of
room
in
the
house
for
it
is
master
isaac
ward
is
always
glad
to
entertain
there
was
something
so
sudden
and
unconventional
about
the
invitation
that
i
was
reluctant
to
accept
it
but
he
gave
it
naturally
and
pressed
it
with
earnest
courtesy
assuring
me
that
it
was
in
accordance
with
master
ward
s
custom
that
he
would
be
much
disappointed
to
lose
the
chance
of
talking
with
an
interesting
traveller
that
he
would
far
rather
let
me
pay
him
for
my
lodging
than
have
me
go
by
and
so
on
so
that
at
last
i
consented
three
minutes
walking
from
the
deserted
clearing
brought
us
into
a
travelled
road
it
circled
the
breast
of
the
mountain
and
as
we
stepped
along
it
in
the
dusk
i
learned
something
of
my
companion
his
name
was
edward
keene
he
taught
latin
and
greek
in
the
hilltop
school
he
had
studied
for
the
ministry
but
had
given
it
up
i
gathered
on
account
of
a
certain
loss
of
interest
or
rather
a
diversion
of
interest
in
another
direction
he
spoke
of
himself
with
an
impersonal
candour
preachers
must
be
always
trying
to
persuade
men
he
said
but
what
i
care
about
is
to
know
men
i
don
t
care
what
they
do
certainly
i
have
no
wish
to
interfere
with
them
in
their
doings
for
i
doubt
whether
anyone
can
really
change
them
each
tree
bears
its
own
fruit
you
see
and
by
their
fruits
you
know
what
do
you
say
to
grafting
that
changes
the
fruit
surely
yes
but
a
grafted
tree
is
not
really
one
tree
it
is
two
trees
growing
together
there
is
a
double
life
in
it
and
the
second
life
the
added
life
dominates
the
other
the
stock
becomes
a
kind
of
animate
soil
for
the
graft
to
grow
presently
the
road
dipped
into
a
little
valley
and
rose
again
breasting
the
slope
of
a
wooded
hill
which
thrust
itself
out
from
the
steeper
flank
of
the
down
the
a
song
floated
to
meet
us
that
most
noble
lyric
of
old
robert
herrick
bid
me
to
live
and
i
will
live
thy
protestant
to
be
or
bid
me
love
and
i
will
give
a
loving
heart
to
thee
it
was
a
girl
s
voice
fresh
and
clear
with
a
note
of
tenderness
in
it
that
thrilled
me
keene
s
pace
quickened
and
soon
the
singer
came
in
sight
stepping
lightly
down
the
road
a
shape
of
slender
whiteness
on
the
background
of
gathering
night
she
was
beautiful
even
in
that
dim
light
with
brown
eyes
and
hair
and
a
face
that
seemed
to
breathe
purity
and
trust
yet
there
was
a
trace
of
anxiety
in
it
or
so
i
fancied
that
gave
it
an
appealing
charm
you
have
come
at
last
edward
she
cried
running
forward
and
putting
her
hand
in
his
it
is
late
you
have
been
out
all
day
i
began
to
be
not
too
late
he
answered
there
was
no
need
for
fear
dorothy
i
am
not
alone
you
and
keeping
her
hand
he
introduced
me
to
the
daughter
of
master
ward
it
was
easy
to
guess
the
relation
between
these
two
young
people
who
walked
beside
me
in
the
dusk
it
needed
no
words
to
say
that
they
were
lovers
yet
it
would
have
needed
many
words
to
define
the
sense
that
came
to
me
gradually
of
something
singular
in
the
tie
that
bound
them
together
on
his
part
there
was
a
certain
tone
of
condescension
toward
her
such
as
one
might
use
to
a
lovely
child
which
seemed
to
match
but
ill
with
her
unconscious
attitude
of
watchful
care
of
tender
solicitude
for
him
almost
like
the
manner
of
an
elder
sister
lovers
they
surely
were
and
acknowledged
lovers
for
their
frankness
of
demeanour
sought
no
concealment
but
i
felt
that
there
must
be
a
little
rift
within
the
lute
though
neither
of
them
might
know
it
each
one
s
thought
of
the
other
was
different
from
the
other
s
thought
of
self
there
could
not
be
a
complete
understanding
a
perfect
accord
what
was
the
secret
of
which
each
knew
half
but
not
the
other
half
thus
with
steps
that
kept
time
but
with
thoughts
how
wide
apart
we
came
to
the
door
of
the
school
a
warm
flood
of
light
poured
out
to
greet
us
the
master
an
elderly
placid
comfortable
man
gave
me
just
the
welcome
that
had
been
promised
in
his
name
the
supper
was
waiting
and
the
evening
passed
in
such
happy
cheer
that
the
bewilderments
and
misgivings
of
the
twilight
melted
away
and
at
bedtime
i
dropped
into
the
nest
of
sleep
as
one
who
has
found
a
shelter
among
friends
ii
the
hilltop
school
stood
on
a
blessed
site
lifted
high
above
the
village
it
held
the
crest
of
the
last
gentle
wave
of
the
mountains
that
filled
the
south
with
crowding
billows
ragged
and
tumultuous
northward
the
great
plain
lay
at
our
feet
smiling
in
the
sun
meadows
and
groves
yellow
fields
of
harvest
and
green
orchards
white
roads
and
clustering
towns
with
here
and
there
a
little
city
on
the
bank
of
the
mighty
river
which
curved
in
a
vast
line
of
beauty
toward
the
blue
catskill
range
fifty
miles
away
lines
of
filmy
smoke
like
vanishing
footprints
in
the
air
marked
the
passage
of
railway
trains
across
the
landscape
their
swift
flight
reduced
by
distance
to
a
leisurely
transition
the
bright
surface
of
the
stream
was
furrowed
by
a
hundred
vessels
tiny
rowboats
creeping
from
shore
to
shore
knots
of
black
barges
following
the
lead
of
puffing
tugs
sloops
with
languid
motion
tacking
against
the
tide
white
steamboats
like
huge
crowded
with
pygmy
inhabitants
moving
smoothly
on
their
way
to
the
great
city
and
disappearing
suddenly
as
they
turned
into
the
narrows
between
and
the
fishkill
mountains
down
there
was
life
incessant
varied
restless
intricate
down
there
was
history
the
highway
of
ancient
voyagers
since
the
days
of
hendrik
hudson
the
of
indian
tribes
the
scenes
of
massacre
and
battle
the
last
camp
of
the
army
of
the
revolution
the
of
washington
down
there
were
the
homes
of
legend
and
poetry
the
dreamlike
hills
of
rip
van
winkle
s
sleep
the
cliffs
and
caves
haunted
by
the
culprit
fay
the
solitudes
traversed
by
the
spy
all
outspread
before
us
and
visible
as
in
a
claude
lorraine
glass
in
the
tranquil
lucidity
of
distance
and
here
on
the
hilltop
was
our
own
life
secluded
yet
never
separated
from
the
other
life
looking
down
upon
it
yet
woven
of
the
same
stuff
peaceful
in
circumstance
yet
ever
busy
with
its
own
tasks
and
holding
in
its
quiet
heart
all
the
elements
of
joy
and
sorrow
and
tragic
consequence
the
master
was
a
man
of
most
unworldly
wisdom
in
his
youth
a
great
traveller
he
had
brought
home
many
observations
a
few
views
and
at
least
one
theory
to
him
the
school
was
the
most
important
of
human
institutions
more
vital
even
than
the
home
because
it
held
the
first
real
experience
of
social
contact
of
free
intercourse
with
other
minds
and
lives
coming
from
different
households
and
embodying
different
strains
of
blood
my
school
said
he
is
the
world
in
miniature
if
i
can
teach
these
boys
to
study
and
play
together
freely
and
with
fairness
to
one
another
i
shall
make
men
fit
to
live
and
work
together
in
society
what
they
learn
matters
less
than
how
they
learn
it
the
great
thing
is
the
bringing
out
of
individual
character
so
that
it
will
find
its
place
in
social
yet
never
man
knew
less
of
character
in
the
concrete
than
master
ward
to
him
each
person
represented
a
type
the
scientific
the
practical
the
poetic
from
each
one
he
expected
and
in
each
one
he
found
to
a
certain
degree
the
fruit
of
the
marked
quality
the
obvious
the
characteristic
but
of
the
deeper
character
made
up
of
a
hundred
traits
coloured
and
conditioned
most
vitally
by
something
secret
and
in
itself
apparently
of
slight
importance
he
was
placidly
unconscious
classes
he
knew
individuals
escaped
him
yet
he
was
a
most
companionable
man
a
social
solitary
a
friendly
hermit
his
daughter
dorothy
seemed
to
me
even
more
fair
and
appealing
by
daylight
than
when
i
first
saw
her
in
the
dusk
there
was
a
pure
brightness
in
her
brown
eyes
a
gentle
dignity
in
her
look
and
bearing
a
soft
cadence
of
expectant
joy
in
her
voice
she
was
womanly
in
every
tone
and
motion
yet
by
no
means
weak
or
uncertain
mistress
of
herself
and
of
the
house
she
ruled
her
kingdom
without
an
effort
busied
with
many
little
cares
she
bore
them
lightly
her
spirit
overflowed
into
the
lives
around
her
with
delicate
sympathy
and
merry
cheer
but
it
was
in
music
that
her
nature
found
its
widest
outlet
in
the
lengthening
evenings
of
late
august
she
would
play
from
schumann
or
chopin
or
grieg
interpreting
the
vague
feelings
of
gladness
or
grief
which
lie
too
deep
for
words
ballads
she
loved
quaint
old
english
and
scotch
airs
of
germany
s
of
ireland
canadian
chansons
she
sang
not
like
an
angel
but
like
a
woman
of
the
two
in
the
school
edward
keene
was
the
elder
the
younger
john
graham
was
his
opposite
in
every
respect
sturdy
plain
in
the
face
he
was
essentially
an
man
devoted
to
sports
a
hard
worker
a
good
player
and
a
sound
sleeper
he
came
back
to
the
school
from
a
a
few
days
after
my
arrival
i
liked
the
way
in
which
he
told
of
his
adventures
with
a
little
frank
boasting
enough
to
season
but
not
to
spoil
the
story
i
liked
the
way
in
which
he
took
hold
of
his
work
helping
to
get
the
school
in
readiness
for
the
return
of
the
boys
in
the
middle
of
september
i
liked
more
than
all
his
attitude
to
dorothy
ward
he
loved
her
clearly
enough
when
she
was
in
the
room
the
other
people
were
only
accidents
to
him
yet
there
was
nothing
of
the
disappointed
suitor
in
his
bearing
he
was
cheerful
natural
accepting
the
situation
giving
her
the
best
he
had
to
give
and
gladly
taking
from
her
the
frank
reliance
the
ready
comradeship
which
she
bestowed
upon
him
if
he
envied
keene
and
how
could
he
help
it
at
least
he
never
showed
a
touch
of
jealousy
or
rivalry
the
engagement
was
a
fact
which
he
took
into
account
as
something
not
to
be
changed
or
questioned
keene
was
so
much
more
brilliant
interesting
attractive
he
answered
so
much
more
fully
to
the
poetic
side
of
dorothy
s
nature
how
could
she
help
preferring
him
thus
the
three
actors
in
the
drama
stood
when
i
became
an
inmate
of
hilltop
and
accepted
the
master
s
invitation
to
undertake
some
of
the
minor
classes
in
english
and
stay
on
at
the
school
indefinitely
it
was
my
wish
to
see
the
little
play
a
pleasant
comedy
i
hoped
move
forward
to
a
happy
ending
and
yet
what
was
it
that
disturbed
me
now
and
then
with
forebodings
something
doubtless
in
the
character
of
keene
for
he
was
the
dominant
personality
the
key
of
the
situation
lay
with
him
he
was
the
centre
of
interest
yet
he
was
the
one
who
seemed
not
perfectly
in
harmony
not
quite
at
home
as
if
something
beckoned
and
urged
him
away
i
am
glad
you
are
to
stay
said
he
yet
i
wonder
at
it
you
will
find
the
life
narrow
after
all
your
travels
ulysses
at
ithaca
you
will
surely
be
restless
to
see
the
world
if
you
find
the
life
broad
enough
i
ought
not
to
be
cramped
in
ah
but
i
have
one
you
certainly
have
said
i
thinking
of
dorothy
and
that
one
is
enough
to
make
a
man
happy
yes
yes
he
answered
quickly
but
that
is
not
what
i
mean
it
is
not
there
that
i
look
for
a
wider
life
love
do
you
think
that
love
broadens
a
man
s
outlook
to
me
it
seems
to
make
him
narrower
happier
perhaps
within
his
own
little
circle
but
distinctly
narrower
knowledge
is
the
only
thing
that
broadens
life
sets
it
free
from
the
tyranny
of
the
parish
fills
it
with
the
sense
of
power
and
love
is
the
opposite
of
knowledge
love
is
a
kind
of
an
illusion
a
happy
illusion
that
is
what
love
is
don
t
you
see
that
see
it
i
cried
i
don
t
know
what
you
mean
do
you
mean
that
you
don
t
really
care
for
dorothy
ward
do
you
mean
that
what
you
have
won
in
her
is
an
illusion
if
so
you
are
as
wrong
as
a
man
can
no
no
he
answered
eagerly
you
know
i
don
t
mean
that
i
could
not
live
without
her
but
love
is
not
the
only
reality
there
is
something
else
something
broader
something
come
away
i
said
come
away
man
you
are
talking
nonsense
treason
you
are
not
true
to
yourself
you
ve
been
working
too
hard
at
your
books
there
s
a
maggot
in
your
brain
come
out
for
a
long
that
indeed
was
what
he
liked
best
he
was
a
magnificent
walker
easy
steady
unwearying
he
knew
every
road
and
lane
in
the
valleys
every
footpath
and
trail
among
the
mountains
but
he
cared
little
for
walking
in
company
one
companion
was
the
most
that
he
could
abide
and
strange
to
say
it
was
not
dorothy
whom
he
chose
for
his
most
frequent
comrade
with
her
he
would
saunter
down
the
black
brook
path
or
climb
slowly
to
the
first
ridge
of
but
with
me
he
pushed
out
to
the
farthest
pinnacle
that
overhangs
the
river
and
down
through
the
lonely
heart
gorge
and
over
the
pass
of
the
white
horse
and
up
to
the
peak
of
cro
nest
and
across
the
rugged
summit
of
black
rock
at
every
wider
outlook
a
strange
exhilaration
seemed
to
come
upon
him
his
spirit
glowed
like
a
live
coal
in
the
wind
he
overflowed
with
brilliant
talk
and
curious
stories
of
the
villages
and
scattered
houses
that
we
could
see
from
our
eyries
but
it
was
not
with
me
that
he
made
his
longest
expeditions
they
were
solitary
early
on
saturday
he
would
leave
the
rest
of
us
with
some
slight
excuse
and
start
away
on
the
to
be
gone
all
day
sometimes
he
would
not
return
till
long
after
dark
then
i
could
see
the
anxious
look
deepen
on
dorothy
s
face
and
she
would
slip
away
down
the
road
to
meet
him
but
he
always
came
back
in
good
spirits
talkable
and
charming
it
was
the
next
day
that
the
reaction
came
the
black
fit
took
him
he
was
silent
moody
bitter
holding
himself
aloof
yet
never
giving
utterance
to
any
irritation
he
seemed
to
resent
the
claims
of
love
and
friendship
as
if
they
irked
him
there
was
a
look
in
his
eyes
as
if
he
measured
us
weighed
us
analysed
us
all
as
strangers
yes
even
dorothy
i
have
seen
her
go
to
meet
him
with
a
flower
in
her
hand
that
she
had
plucked
for
him
and
turn
away
with
her
lips
trembling
too
proud
to
say
a
word
dropping
the
flower
on
the
grass
john
graham
saw
it
too
he
waited
till
she
was
gone
then
he
picked
up
the
flower
and
kept
it
there
was
nothing
to
take
offence
at
nothing
on
which
one
could
lay
a
finger
only
these
singular
alternations
of
mood
which
made
keene
now
the
most
delightful
of
friends
now
an
intimate
stranger
in
the
circle
the
change
was
inexplicable
but
certainly
it
seemed
to
have
some
connection
as
cause
or
consequence
with
his
long
lonely
walks
once
when
he
was
absent
we
spoke
of
his
remarkable
fluctuations
of
spirit
the
master
labelled
him
he
is
an
idealist
a
dreamer
they
are
always
i
blamed
him
he
gives
way
too
much
to
his
moods
he
lacks
he
is
in
danger
of
spoiling
a
fine
i
looked
at
dorothy
she
defended
him
why
should
he
be
always
the
same
he
is
too
great
for
that
his
thoughts
make
him
restless
and
sometimes
he
is
tired
surely
you
wouldn
t
have
him
act
what
he
don
t
feel
why
do
you
want
him
to
do
that
i
don
t
know
said
graham
with
a
short
laugh
none
of
us
know
but
what
we
all
want
just
now
is
music
dorothy
will
you
sing
a
little
for
us
so
she
sang
the
coulin
and
the
days
o
the
kerry
dancin
and
the
hawthorn
tree
and
the
green
woods
of
truigha
and
flowers
o
the
forest
and
a
la
claire
fontaine
until
the
twilight
was
filled
with
peace
the
boys
came
back
to
the
school
the
wheels
of
routine
began
to
turn
again
slowly
and
with
a
little
friction
at
first
then
smoothly
and
swiftly
as
if
they
had
never
stopped
summer
reddened
into
autumn
autumn
bronzed
into
fall
the
maples
and
poplars
were
bare
the
oaks
alone
kept
their
rusted
crimson
glory
and
the
cloaks
of
spruce
and
hemlock
on
the
shoulders
of
the
hills
grew
dark
with
wintry
foliage
keene
s
transitions
of
mood
became
more
frequent
and
more
extreme
the
gulf
of
isolation
that
divided
him
from
us
when
the
black
days
came
seemed
wider
and
more
unfathomable
dorothy
and
john
graham
were
thrown
more
constantly
together
keene
appeared
to
encourage
their
companionship
he
watched
them
curiously
sometimes
not
as
if
he
were
jealous
but
rather
as
if
he
were
interested
in
some
delicate
experiment
at
other
times
he
would
be
singularly
indifferent
to
everything
remote
abstracted
forgetful
dorothy
s
birthday
which
fell
in
was
kept
as
a
holiday
in
the
morning
everyone
had
some
little
birthday
gift
for
her
except
keene
he
had
forgotten
the
birthday
entirely
the
shadow
of
disappointment
that
quenched
the
brightness
of
her
face
was
pitiful
even
he
could
not
be
blind
to
it
he
flushed
as
if
surprised
and
hesitated
a
moment
evidently
in
conflict
with
himself
then
a
look
of
shame
and
regret
came
into
his
eyes
he
made
some
excuse
for
not
going
with
us
to
the
picnic
at
the
black
brook
falls
with
which
the
day
was
celebrated
in
the
afternoon
as
we
all
sat
around
the
he
came
swinging
through
the
woods
with
his
long
swift
stride
and
going
at
once
to
dorothy
laid
a
little
brooch
of
pearl
and
opal
in
her
hand
will
you
forgive
me
he
said
i
hope
this
is
not
too
late
but
i
lost
the
train
back
from
newburg
and
walked
home
i
pray
that
you
may
never
know
any
tears
but
pearls
and
that
there
may
be
nothing
changeable
about
you
but
the
oh
edward
she
cried
how
beautiful
thank
you
a
thousand
times
but
i
wish
you
had
been
with
us
all
day
we
have
missed
you
so
much
for
the
rest
of
that
day
simplicity
and
clearness
and
joy
came
back
to
us
keene
was
at
his
best
a
leader
of
friendly
merriment
a
master
of
a
prince
of
delicate
chivalry
dorothy
s
loveliness
unfolded
like
a
flower
in
the
sun
but
the
indian
summer
of
peace
was
brief
it
was
hardly
a
week
before
keene
s
old
moods
returned
darker
and
stranger
than
ever
the
girl
s
unconcealable
bewilderment
her
sense
of
wounded
loyalty
and
baffled
anxiety
her
still
look
of
hurt
and
wondering
tenderness
increased
from
day
to
day
john
graham
s
temper
seemed
to
change
suddenly
and
completely
from
the
and
most
careless
fellow
in
the
world
he
became
silent
thoughtful
irritable
toward
everyone
except
dorothy
with
keene
he
was
curt
and
impatient
avoiding
him
as
much
as
possible
and
when
they
were
together
evidently
struggling
to
keep
down
a
deep
dislike
and
rising
anger
they
had
had
sharp
words
when
they
were
alone
i
was
sure
but
keene
s
coolness
seemed
to
grow
with
graham
s
heat
there
was
no
open
quarrel
one
saturday
evening
graham
came
to
me
you
have
seen
what
is
going
on
here
he
said
something
at
least
i
answered
and
i
am
very
sorry
for
it
but
i
don
t
quite
understand
well
i
do
and
i
m
going
to
put
an
end
to
it
i
m
going
to
have
it
out
with
ned
keene
he
is
breaking
her
but
are
you
the
right
one
to
take
the
matter
up
who
else
is
there
to
do
it
her
he
sees
nothing
comprehends
nothing
practical
type
poetic
type
misunderstandings
sure
to
arise
come
together
after
a
while
each
supply
the
other
s
cursed
folly
and
the
girl
so
unhappy
that
she
can
t
tell
anyone
it
shall
not
go
on
i
say
keene
is
out
on
the
road
now
taking
one
of
his
infernal
walks
i
m
going
to
meet
i
m
afraid
it
will
make
trouble
let
me
go
with
the
trouble
is
made
come
if
you
like
i
m
going
the
night
lay
heavy
upon
the
forest
where
the
road
dipped
through
the
valley
we
could
hardly
see
a
rod
ahead
of
us
but
higher
up
where
the
way
curved
around
the
breast
of
the
mountain
the
woods
were
thin
on
the
left
and
on
the
right
a
sheer
precipice
fell
away
to
the
gorge
of
the
brook
in
the
dim
starlight
we
saw
keene
striding
toward
us
graham
stepped
out
to
meet
him
where
have
you
been
ned
keene
he
cried
the
cry
was
a
challenge
keene
lifted
his
head
and
stood
still
then
he
laughed
and
took
a
step
forward
taking
a
long
walk
jack
graham
he
answered
it
was
glorious
you
should
have
been
with
me
but
why
this
sudden
question
because
your
long
walk
is
a
pretence
you
are
playing
false
there
is
some
woman
that
you
go
to
see
at
west
point
at
highland
falls
who
knows
where
keene
laughed
again
certainly
you
don
t
know
my
dear
fellow
and
neither
do
i
since
when
has
walking
become
a
vice
in
your
estimation
you
seem
to
be
in
a
fierce
mood
what
s
the
matter
i
will
tell
you
what
s
the
matter
you
have
been
acting
like
a
brute
to
the
girl
you
profess
to
plain
words
but
between
friends
frankness
is
best
did
she
ask
you
to
tell
me
no
you
know
too
well
she
would
die
before
she
would
speak
you
are
killing
her
that
is
what
you
are
doing
with
your
devilish
moods
and
mysteries
you
must
stop
do
you
hear
you
must
give
her
i
hear
well
enough
and
it
sounds
like
a
word
for
her
and
two
for
yourself
is
that
it
damn
you
cried
the
younger
man
let
the
words
go
we
ll
settle
it
this
way
and
he
sprang
at
the
other
s
throat
keene
cool
and
met
him
with
a
heavy
blow
in
the
chest
he
recoiled
and
i
rushed
between
them
holding
graham
back
and
pleading
for
as
we
stood
thus
panting
and
confused
on
the
edge
of
the
cliff
a
singing
voice
floated
up
to
us
from
the
shadows
across
the
valley
it
was
herrick
s
song
again
a
heart
as
soft
a
heart
as
kind
a
heart
as
sound
and
free
is
in
the
whole
world
thou
canst
find
that
heart
i
ll
give
to
thee
come
gentlemen
i
cried
this
is
folly
sheer
madness
you
can
never
deal
with
the
matter
in
this
way
think
of
the
girl
who
is
singing
down
yonder
what
would
happen
to
her
what
would
she
suffer
from
scandal
from
her
own
feelings
if
either
of
you
should
be
killed
or
even
seriously
hurt
by
the
other
there
must
be
no
quarrel
between
certainly
said
keene
whose
poise
if
shaken
at
all
had
returned
certainly
you
are
right
it
is
not
of
my
seeking
nor
shall
i
be
the
one
to
keep
it
up
i
am
willing
to
let
it
pass
it
is
but
a
small
matter
at
i
turned
to
graham
and
you
he
hesitated
a
little
and
then
said
doggedly
on
one
and
that
is
keene
must
explain
he
must
answer
my
do
you
accept
i
asked
keene
yes
and
no
he
replied
no
to
answering
graham
s
question
he
is
not
the
person
to
ask
it
i
wonder
that
he
does
not
see
the
impropriety
the
absurdity
of
his
meddling
at
all
in
this
affair
besides
he
could
not
understand
my
answer
even
if
he
believed
it
but
to
the
explanation
i
say
yes
i
will
give
it
not
to
graham
but
to
you
i
make
you
this
proposition
is
sunday
we
shall
be
excused
from
service
if
we
tell
the
master
that
we
have
important
business
to
settle
together
you
shall
come
with
me
on
one
of
my
long
walks
i
will
tell
you
all
about
them
then
you
can
be
the
judge
whether
there
is
any
harm
in
does
that
satisfy
you
i
said
to
graham
yes
he
answered
that
seems
fair
enough
i
am
content
to
leave
it
in
that
way
for
the
present
and
to
make
it
still
more
fair
i
want
to
take
back
what
i
said
awhile
ago
and
to
ask
keene
s
pardon
for
not
at
all
said
keene
quickly
it
was
said
in
haste
i
bear
no
grudge
you
simply
did
not
understand
that
is
so
we
turned
to
go
down
the
hill
and
as
we
turned
dorothy
met
us
coming
out
of
the
shadows
what
are
you
men
doing
here
she
asked
i
heard
your
voices
from
below
what
were
you
talking
about
we
were
talking
said
keene
my
dear
dorothy
we
were
talking
about
walking
yes
that
was
it
about
walking
and
about
views
the
conversation
was
quite
warm
almost
a
debate
now
you
know
all
the
in
this
region
which
do
you
call
the
best
the
most
satisfying
the
finest
prospect
but
i
know
what
you
will
say
the
view
from
the
little
knoll
in
front
of
hilltop
for
there
when
you
are
tired
of
looking
far
away
you
can
turn
around
and
see
the
old
school
and
the
and
the
yes
she
answered
gravely
that
is
really
the
view
that
i
love
best
i
would
give
up
all
the
others
rather
than
lose
iii
there
was
a
softness
in
the
november
air
that
brought
back
memories
of
summer
and
a
few
belated
daisies
were
blooming
in
the
old
clearing
as
keene
and
i
passed
by
the
ruins
of
the
again
early
on
sunday
morning
he
had
been
talking
ever
since
we
started
pouring
out
his
praise
of
knowledge
wide
clear
universal
knowledge
as
the
best
of
life
s
joys
the
greatest
of
life
s
achievements
the
practical
life
was
a
blind
dull
routine
most
men
were
toiling
at
tasks
which
they
did
not
like
by
rules
which
they
did
not
understand
they
never
looked
beyond
the
edge
of
their
work
the
philosophical
life
was
a
spider
s
web
filmy
threads
of
theory
spun
out
of
the
inner
consciousness
it
touched
the
world
only
at
certain
chosen
points
of
attachment
there
was
nothing
firm
nothing
substantial
in
it
you
could
look
through
it
like
a
veil
and
see
the
real
world
lying
beyond
but
the
theorist
could
see
only
the
web
which
he
had
spun
knowing
did
not
come
by
speculating
theorising
knowing
came
by
seeing
vision
was
the
only
real
knowledge
to
see
the
world
the
whole
world
as
it
is
to
look
behind
the
scenes
to
read
human
life
like
a
book
that
was
the
glorious
thing
most
satisfying
divine
thus
he
had
talked
as
we
climbed
the
hill
now
as
we
came
by
the
place
where
we
had
first
met
a
new
eagerness
sounded
in
his
voice
ever
since
that
day
i
have
inclined
to
tell
you
something
more
about
myself
i
felt
sure
you
would
understand
i
am
planning
to
write
a
book
a
book
of
knowledge
in
the
true
sense
a
great
book
about
human
life
not
a
history
not
a
theory
but
a
real
view
of
life
its
hidden
motives
its
secret
relations
how
different
they
are
from
what
men
dream
and
imagine
and
play
that
they
are
how
much
darker
how
much
smaller
and
therefore
how
much
more
interesting
and
wonderful
no
one
has
yet
written
perhaps
because
no
one
has
yet
conceived
such
a
book
as
i
have
in
mind
i
might
call
it
a
but
surely
said
i
you
have
chosen
a
strange
place
to
write
it
the
hilltop
school
this
quiet
and
secluded
region
the
stream
of
humanity
is
very
slow
and
slender
here
it
trickles
you
must
get
out
into
the
busy
world
you
must
be
in
the
full
current
and
feel
its
force
you
must
take
part
in
the
active
life
of
mankind
in
order
really
to
know
a
mistake
he
cried
action
is
the
thing
that
blinds
men
you
remember
matthew
arnold
s
line
in
action
s
dizzying
eddy
whurled
to
know
the
world
you
must
stand
apart
from
it
and
above
it
you
must
look
down
on
well
then
said
i
you
will
have
to
find
some
secret
spring
of
inspiration
some
point
of
vantage
from
which
you
can
get
your
outlook
and
your
he
stopped
short
and
looked
me
full
in
the
face
and
that
cried
he
is
precisely
what
i
have
found
then
he
turned
and
pushed
along
the
narrow
trail
so
swiftly
that
i
had
hard
work
to
follow
him
after
a
few
minutes
we
came
to
a
little
stream
flowing
through
a
grove
of
hemlocks
keene
seated
himself
on
the
fallen
log
that
served
for
a
bridge
and
beckoned
me
to
a
place
beside
him
i
promised
to
give
you
an
explanation
to
take
you
on
one
of
my
long
walks
well
there
is
only
one
of
them
it
is
always
the
same
you
shall
see
where
it
leads
what
it
means
you
shall
share
my
secret
all
the
wonder
and
glory
of
it
of
course
i
know
my
conduct
has
seemed
strange
to
you
sometimes
it
has
seemed
strange
even
to
me
i
have
been
doubtful
troubled
almost
distracted
i
have
been
risking
a
great
deal
in
danger
of
losing
what
i
value
what
most
men
count
the
best
thing
in
the
world
but
it
could
not
be
helped
the
risk
was
worth
while
a
great
discovery
the
opportunity
of
a
lifetime
yes
of
an
age
perhaps
of
many
ages
came
to
me
i
simply
could
not
throw
it
away
i
must
use
it
make
the
best
of
it
at
any
danger
at
any
cost
you
shall
judge
for
yourself
whether
i
was
right
or
wrong
but
you
must
judge
fairly
without
haste
without
prejudice
i
ask
you
to
make
me
one
promise
you
will
suspend
judgment
you
will
say
nothing
you
will
keep
my
secret
until
you
have
been
with
me
three
times
at
the
place
where
i
am
now
taking
by
this
time
it
was
clear
to
me
that
i
had
to
do
with
a
case
lying
far
outside
of
the
common
routine
of
life
something
subtle
abnormal
hard
to
measure
in
which
a
clear
and
careful
estimate
would
be
necessary
if
keene
was
labouring
under
some
strange
delusion
some
disorder
of
mind
how
could
i
estimate
its
nature
or
extent
without
time
and
study
perhaps
without
expert
advice
to
wait
a
little
would
be
prudent
for
his
sake
as
well
as
for
the
sake
of
others
if
there
was
some
extraordinary
reality
behind
his
mysterious
hints
it
would
need
patience
and
skill
to
test
it
i
gave
him
the
promise
for
which
he
asked
at
once
as
if
relieved
he
sprang
up
and
crying
come
on
follow
me
began
to
make
his
way
up
the
bed
of
the
brook
it
was
one
of
the
wildest
walks
that
i
have
ever
taken
he
turned
aside
for
no
obstacles
swamps
masses
of
interlacing
alders
thickets
of
stiff
young
spruces
of
dead
trees
where
had
mowed
down
the
forest
walls
of
rock
landslides
where
heaps
of
broken
stone
were
tumbled
in
ruinous
confusion
through
everything
he
pushed
forward
i
could
see
here
and
there
the
track
of
his
former
journeys
broken
branches
of
and
ferns
trampled
down
a
faint
trail
across
some
deeper
bed
of
moss
at
we
rested
for
a
to
eat
lunch
but
keene
would
eat
nothing
except
a
little
pellet
of
some
dark
green
substance
that
he
took
from
a
flat
silver
box
in
his
pocket
he
swallowed
it
hastily
and
stooping
his
face
to
the
spring
by
which
he
had
halted
drank
long
and
eagerly
an
indian
trick
said
he
shaking
the
drops
of
water
from
his
face
on
a
walk
food
is
a
hindrance
a
delay
but
this
tiny
taste
of
bitter
gum
is
a
tonic
it
spurs
the
courage
and
doubles
the
strength
if
you
are
used
to
it
otherwise
i
should
not
recommend
you
to
try
it
faugh
the
flavour
is
he
rinsed
his
mouth
again
with
water
and
stood
up
calling
me
to
come
on
the
way
now
tangled
among
the
nameless
peaks
and
ranges
bore
steadily
southward
rising
all
the
time
in
spite
of
many
brief
downward
curves
where
a
steep
gorge
must
be
crossed
presently
we
came
into
a
forest
open
and
easy
to
travel
breasting
a
long
slope
we
reached
the
summit
of
a
broad
smoothly
rounding
ridge
covered
with
a
dense
growth
of
stunted
spruce
the
trees
rose
above
our
heads
about
twice
the
height
of
a
man
and
so
thick
that
we
could
not
see
beyond
them
but
from
glimpses
here
and
there
and
from
the
purity
and
lightness
of
the
air
i
judged
that
we
were
on
far
higher
ground
than
any
we
had
yet
traversed
the
central
comb
perhaps
of
the
a
few
yards
ahead
of
us
through
the
crowded
trunks
of
the
dwarf
forest
i
saw
a
gray
mass
like
the
wall
of
a
fortress
across
our
path
it
was
a
vast
rock
rising
from
the
crest
of
the
ridge
lifting
its
top
above
the
sea
of
foliage
at
its
base
there
were
heaps
of
shattered
stones
and
deep
crevices
almost
like
caves
one
side
of
the
rock
was
broken
by
a
slanting
gully
be
careful
cried
my
companion
there
is
a
rattlers
den
somewhere
about
here
the
snakes
are
in
their
winter
quarters
now
almost
dormant
but
they
can
still
strike
if
you
tread
on
them
step
here
give
me
your
hand
use
that
point
of
rock
hold
fast
by
this
bush
it
is
firmly
rooted
so
here
we
are
on
spy
rock
you
have
heard
of
it
i
thought
so
other
people
have
heard
of
it
and
imagine
that
they
have
found
it
five
miles
east
of
us
on
a
lower
ridge
others
think
it
is
a
peak
just
back
of
cro
nest
all
wrong
there
is
but
one
real
spy
rock
here
this
earth
holds
no
more
perfect
it
is
one
of
the
rare
places
from
which
a
man
may
see
the
kingdoms
of
the
world
and
all
the
glory
of
them
look
the
prospect
was
indeed
magnificent
it
was
strange
what
a
vast
enlargement
of
vision
resulted
from
the
slight
elevation
above
the
surrounding
peaks
it
was
like
being
lifted
up
so
that
we
could
look
over
the
walls
the
horizon
expanded
as
if
by
magic
the
vast
circumference
of
vision
swept
around
us
with
a
radius
of
a
hundred
miles
mountain
and
meadow
forest
and
field
river
and
lake
hill
and
dale
village
and
farmland
city
and
shimmering
water
all
lay
open
to
our
sight
and
over
all
the
westering
sun
wove
a
transparent
robe
of
hues
every
feature
of
the
landscape
seemed
alive
quivering
pulsating
with
conscious
beauty
you
could
almost
see
the
world
breathe
wonderful
i
cried
most
wonderful
you
have
found
a
mount
of
ah
he
answered
you
don
t
half
see
the
wonder
yet
you
don
t
begin
to
appreciate
it
your
eyes
are
new
to
it
you
have
not
learned
the
power
of
far
sight
the
secret
of
spy
rock
you
are
still
shut
in
by
the
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
can
look
beyond
it
beyond
yours
yes
and
beyond
any
that
you
would
dream
possible
see
your
sight
reaches
to
that
dim
cloud
of
smoke
in
the
south
and
beneath
it
you
can
make
out
perhaps
a
vague
blotch
of
shadow
or
a
tiny
flash
of
brightness
where
the
sun
strikes
it
new
york
but
i
can
see
the
great
buildings
the
domes
the
spires
the
crowded
wharves
the
tides
of
people
whirling
through
the
streets
and
beyond
that
the
sea
with
the
ships
coming
and
going
i
can
follow
them
on
their
courses
and
beyond
that
oh
when
i
am
on
spy
rock
i
can
see
more
than
other
men
can
for
a
moment
strange
to
say
i
almost
fancied
could
follow
him
the
magnetism
of
his
spirit
imposed
upon
me
carried
me
away
with
him
then
sober
reason
told
me
that
he
was
talking
of
impossibilities
keene
said
i
you
are
dreaming
the
view
and
the
air
have
intoxicated
you
this
is
a
phantasy
a
delusion
it
pleases
you
to
call
it
so
he
said
but
i
only
tell
you
my
real
experience
why
it
should
be
impossible
i
do
not
understand
there
is
no
reason
why
the
power
of
sight
should
not
be
cultivated
enlarged
expanded
and
the
straight
rays
of
light
i
asked
and
the
curvature
of
the
earth
which
makes
a
horizon
inevitable
who
knows
what
a
ray
of
light
is
said
he
who
can
prove
that
it
may
not
be
curved
under
certain
conditions
or
refracted
in
some
places
in
a
way
that
is
not
possible
elsewhere
i
tell
you
there
is
something
extraordinary
about
this
spy
rock
it
is
a
seat
of
power
nature
s
observatory
more
things
are
visible
here
than
anywhere
else
more
than
i
have
told
you
yet
but
come
we
have
little
time
left
for
half
an
hour
each
of
us
shall
enjoy
what
he
can
see
then
home
again
to
the
narrower
outlook
the
restricted
the
downward
journey
was
swifter
than
the
ascent
but
no
less
fatiguing
by
the
time
we
reached
the
school
an
hour
after
dark
i
was
very
tired
but
keene
was
in
one
of
his
moods
of
exhilaration
he
glowed
like
a
piece
of
phosphorus
that
has
been
drenched
with
light
graham
took
the
first
opportunity
of
speaking
with
me
alone
well
said
he
well
i
answered
you
were
wrong
there
is
no
treason
in
keene
s
walks
no
guilt
in
his
moods
but
there
is
something
very
strange
i
can
not
form
a
judgment
yet
as
to
what
we
should
do
we
must
wait
a
few
days
it
will
do
no
harm
to
be
patient
indeed
i
have
promised
not
to
judge
not
to
speak
of
it
until
a
certain
time
are
you
satisfied
this
is
a
curious
story
said
he
and
i
am
puzzled
by
it
but
i
trust
you
i
agree
to
wait
though
i
am
far
from
our
second
expedition
was
appointed
for
the
following
saturday
keene
was
hungry
for
it
and
i
was
almost
as
eager
desiring
to
penetrate
as
quickly
as
possible
into
the
heart
of
the
affair
already
a
conviction
in
regard
to
it
was
pressing
upon
me
and
i
resolved
to
let
him
talk
this
time
as
freely
as
he
would
without
interruption
or
denial
when
we
clambered
up
on
spy
rock
he
was
more
subdued
and
reserved
than
he
had
been
the
first
time
for
a
while
he
talked
little
but
scanned
view
with
wide
shining
eyes
then
he
began
to
tell
me
stories
of
the
places
that
we
could
see
strange
stories
of
domestic
calamity
and
social
conflict
and
eccentric
passion
and
hidden
crime
do
you
remember
hawthorne
s
story
of
the
minister
s
black
veil
it
is
the
best
comment
on
human
life
that
ever
was
written
everyone
has
something
to
hide
the
surface
of
life
is
a
mask
the
substance
of
life
is
a
secret
all
humanity
wears
the
black
veil
but
it
is
not
impenetrable
no
it
is
transparent
if
you
find
the
right
point
of
view
here
on
spy
rock
i
have
found
it
i
have
learned
how
to
look
through
the
veil
i
can
see
not
by
the
only
but
by
the
rays
which
are
colourless
imperceptible
irresistible
the
rays
of
the
unknown
quantity
which
penetrate
everywhere
i
can
see
how
men
down
in
the
great
city
are
weaving
their
nets
of
selfishness
and
falsehood
and
calling
them
industrial
enterprises
or
political
combinations
i
can
see
how
the
wheels
of
society
are
moved
by
the
hidden
springs
of
avarice
and
greed
and
rivalry
i
can
see
how
children
drink
in
the
fables
of
religion
without
understanding
them
and
how
prudent
men
repeat
them
without
believing
them
i
can
see
how
the
illusions
of
love
appear
and
vanish
and
how
men
and
women
swear
that
their
dreams
are
eternal
even
while
they
fade
i
can
see
how
poor
people
blind
themselves
and
deceive
each
other
calling
selfishness
devotion
and
bondage
contentment
down
at
hilltop
yonder
i
can
see
how
dorothy
ward
and
john
graham
without
knowing
it
without
meaning
it
stop
man
i
cried
stop
before
you
say
what
can
never
be
unsaid
you
know
it
is
not
true
these
are
nightmare
visions
that
ride
you
not
from
spy
rock
nor
from
anywhere
else
can
you
see
anything
at
hilltop
that
is
not
honest
and
pure
and
loyal
come
down
now
and
let
us
go
home
you
will
see
better
there
than
i
think
not
said
he
but
i
will
come
yes
of
course
i
am
bound
to
come
but
let
me
have
a
few
minutes
here
alone
go
you
down
along
the
path
a
little
way
slowly
i
will
follow
you
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
remember
we
are
to
be
here
together
once
more
once
more
yes
and
then
what
must
be
done
how
was
this
strange
case
to
be
dealt
with
so
as
to
save
all
the
actors
as
far
as
possible
from
needless
suffering
that
keene
s
mind
was
disordered
at
least
three
of
us
suspected
already
but
to
me
alone
was
the
nature
and
seat
of
the
disorder
known
how
make
the
others
understand
it
they
might
easily
conceive
it
to
be
something
different
from
the
fact
some
actual
lesion
of
the
brain
an
incurable
insanity
but
this
it
was
not
as
yet
at
least
he
was
no
patient
for
a
it
would
be
unjust
probably
it
would
be
impossible
to
have
him
committed
but
on
the
other
hand
they
might
take
it
too
lightly
as
the
result
of
overwork
or
perhaps
of
the
use
of
some
narcotic
to
me
it
was
certain
that
the
trouble
went
far
deeper
than
this
it
lay
in
the
man
s
moral
nature
in
the
error
of
his
central
will
it
was
the
working
out
in
abnormal
form
but
with
essential
truth
of
his
chosen
and
cherished
ideal
of
life
spy
rock
was
something
more
than
the
seat
of
his
delusion
it
was
the
expression
of
his
temperament
the
solitary
trail
that
led
thither
was
the
symbol
of
his
search
for
happiness
alone
forgetful
of
life
s
lowlier
ties
looking
down
upon
the
world
in
the
cold
abstraction
of
scornful
knowledge
how
was
such
a
man
to
be
brought
back
to
the
real
life
whose
first
condition
is
the
acceptance
of
a
limited
outlook
the
willingness
to
live
by
trust
as
much
as
by
sight
the
power
of
finding
joy
and
peace
in
the
things
that
we
feel
are
the
best
even
though
we
can
not
prove
them
nor
explain
them
how
could
he
ever
bring
anything
but
discord
and
sorrow
to
those
who
were
bound
to
him
this
was
what
perplexed
and
oppressed
me
i
needed
all
the
time
until
the
next
saturday
to
think
the
question
through
to
decide
what
should
be
done
but
the
matter
was
taken
out
of
my
hands
after
our
latest
expedition
keene
s
dark
mood
returned
upon
him
with
sombre
intensity
dull
restless
indifferent
he
seemed
to
withdraw
into
himself
observing
those
around
him
with
glances
as
if
he
had
nothing
better
to
do
and
yet
found
it
a
tiresome
pastime
he
was
like
a
man
waiting
wearily
at
a
railway
station
for
his
train
nothing
pleased
him
he
responded
to
nothing
graham
controlled
his
indignation
by
a
constant
effort
a
dozen
times
he
was
on
the
point
of
speaking
out
but
he
restrained
himself
and
played
fair
dorothy
s
suffering
could
not
be
hidden
her
loyalty
was
strained
to
the
breaking
point
she
was
too
tender
and
true
for
anger
but
she
was
wounded
almost
beyond
endurance
keene
s
restlessness
increased
the
intervening
thursday
was
thanksgiving
day
most
of
the
boys
had
gone
home
the
school
had
holiday
early
in
the
morning
he
came
to
me
let
us
take
our
walk
we
have
no
work
to
do
come
in
this
clear
frosty
air
spy
rock
will
be
glorious
no
i
answered
this
is
no
day
for
such
an
expedition
this
is
the
home
day
stay
here
and
be
happy
with
us
all
you
owe
this
to
love
and
friendship
you
owe
it
to
dorothy
owe
it
said
he
speaking
of
debts
i
think
each
man
is
his
own
preferred
creditor
but
of
course
you
can
do
as
you
like
about
tomorrow
or
saturday
will
answer
just
as
well
for
our
third
walk
about
noon
he
came
down
from
his
room
and
went
to
the
piano
where
dorothy
was
sitting
they
talked
together
in
low
tones
then
she
stood
up
with
pale
face
and
eyes
she
laid
her
hand
on
his
arm
do
not
go
edward
for
the
last
time
i
beg
you
to
stay
with
us
he
lifted
her
hand
and
held
it
for
an
instant
then
he
bowed
and
let
it
fall
you
will
excuse
me
dorothy
i
am
sure
i
feel
the
need
of
exercise
absolutely
i
must
go
until
the
the
hours
of
that
day
passed
heavily
for
all
of
us
there
was
a
sense
of
disaster
in
the
air
something
irretrievable
had
fallen
from
our
circle
but
no
one
dared
to
name
it
night
closed
in
upon
the
house
with
a
changing
sky
all
the
stars
were
hidden
the
wind
whimpered
and
then
shouted
the
rain
swept
down
in
spiteful
volleys
deepening
at
last
into
a
fierce
steady
discharge
nine
o
clock
ten
o
clock
passed
and
keene
did
not
return
by
midnight
we
were
certain
that
some
accident
had
befallen
him
it
was
impossible
to
go
up
into
the
mountains
in
that
of
furious
tempest
but
we
could
send
down
to
the
village
for
men
to
organise
a
and
to
bring
the
doctor
at
daybreak
we
set
out
some
of
the
men
going
with
the
master
along
black
brook
others
in
different
directions
to
make
sure
of
a
complete
search
graham
and
the
doctor
and
i
following
the
secret
trail
that
i
knew
only
too
well
dorothy
insisted
that
she
must
go
she
would
bear
no
denial
declaring
that
it
would
be
worse
for
her
alone
at
home
than
if
we
took
her
with
us
it
was
incredible
how
the
path
seemed
to
lengthen
graham
watched
the
girl
s
every
step
helping
her
over
the
difficult
places
pushing
aside
the
tangled
branches
his
eyes
resting
upon
her
as
frankly
as
tenderly
as
a
mother
looks
at
her
child
in
single
file
we
marched
through
the
gray
morning
clearing
cold
after
the
storm
and
the
silence
was
seldom
broken
for
we
had
little
heart
to
talk
at
last
we
came
to
the
high
lonely
ridge
the
dwarf
forest
the
huge
couchant
bulk
of
spy
rock
there
on
the
back
of
it
with
his
right
arm
hanging
over
the
edge
was
the
outline
of
edward
keene
s
form
it
was
as
if
some
monster
had
seized
him
and
flung
him
over
its
shoulder
to
carry
away
we
called
to
him
but
there
was
no
answer
the
doctor
climbed
up
with
me
and
we
hurried
to
the
spot
where
he
was
lying
his
face
was
turned
to
the
sky
his
eyes
blindly
staring
there
was
no
pulse
no
breath
he
was
already
cold
in
death
his
right
hand
and
arm
the
side
of
his
neck
and
face
were
horribly
swollen
and
livid
the
doctor
stooped
down
and
examined
the
hand
carefully
see
he
cried
pointing
to
a
great
bruise
on
his
wrist
with
two
tiny
punctures
in
the
middle
of
it
from
which
a
few
drops
of
blood
had
oozed
a
rattlesnake
has
struck
him
he
must
have
fairly
put
his
hand
upon
it
perhaps
in
the
dark
when
he
was
climbing
and
look
what
is
this
he
picked
up
a
flat
silver
box
that
lay
open
on
the
rock
there
were
two
pellets
of
a
resinous
paste
in
it
he
lifted
it
to
his
face
and
drew
a
long
breath
yes
he
said
it
is
gunjab
the
most
powerful
form
of
hashish
the
narcotic
hemp
of
india
poor
fellow
it
saved
him
from
frightful
agony
he
died
in
a
you
are
right
i
said
in
a
dream
and
for
a
we
covered
his
face
and
climbed
down
the
rock
dorothy
and
graham
were
waiting
below
he
had
put
his
coat
around
her
she
was
shivering
a
little
there
were
on
her
face
well
i
said
you
must
know
it
we
have
lost
ah
said
the
girl
i
lost
him
long
there
are
three
vines
that
belong
to
the
ancient
forest
elsewhere
they
will
not
grow
though
the
soil
prepared
for
them
be
never
so
rich
the
shade
of
the
arbour
built
for
them
never
so
closely
and
cunningly
woven
their
delicate
roots
take
no
hold
upon
the
earth
tilled
and
troubled
by
the
fingers
of
man
the
fine
sap
that
steals
through
their
long
slender
limbs
pauses
and
fails
when
they
are
watered
by
human
hands
silently
the
secret
of
their
life
retreats
and
shrinks
away
and
hides
itself
but
in
the
woods
where
falling
leaves
and
crumbling
and
wilting
ferns
have
been
moulded
by
nature
into
a
deep
brown
humus
clean
and
fragrant
in
the
woods
where
the
sunlight
filters
green
and
golden
through
interlacing
branches
and
where
pure
moisture
of
distilling
rains
and
melting
snows
is
held
in
treasury
by
banks
of
moss
under
the
verdurous
flood
of
the
forest
like
under
the
ocean
waves
these
three
little
creeping
vines
put
forth
their
hands
with
joy
and
spread
over
rock
and
hillock
and
twisted
and
mouldering
log
in
cloaks
and
scarves
and
wreaths
of
tiny
evergreen
glossy
leaves
one
of
them
is
adorned
with
white
pearls
sprinkled
lightly
over
its
robe
of
green
this
is
snowberry
and
if
you
eat
of
it
you
will
grow
wise
in
the
wisdom
of
flowers
you
will
know
where
to
find
the
yellow
violet
and
the
and
the
pink
and
the
scarlet
sage
and
the
fringed
gentian
you
will
understand
how
the
buds
trust
themselves
to
the
spring
in
their
unfolding
and
how
the
blossoms
trust
themselves
to
the
winter
in
their
withering
and
how
the
busy
bands
of
nature
are
ever
weaving
the
beautiful
garment
of
life
out
of
the
strands
of
death
and
nothing
is
lost
that
yields
itself
to
her
quiet
handling
another
of
the
vines
of
the
forest
is
called
rubies
are
hidden
among
its
foliage
and
if
you
eat
of
this
fruit
you
will
grow
wise
in
the
wisdom
of
birds
you
will
know
where
the
secretes
her
nest
and
where
the
dances
in
the
air
at
night
the
of
the
ruffed
grouse
will
be
easy
to
find
and
you
will
see
the
dark
lodges
of
the
evergreen
thickets
inhabited
by
hundreds
of
warblers
there
will
be
no
dead
silence
for
you
in
the
forest
any
longer
but
you
will
hear
sweet
and
delicate
voices
on
every
side
voices
that
you
know
and
love
you
will
catch
the
of
the
silver
flute
of
the
woodthrush
and
the
silver
harp
of
the
veery
and
the
silver
bells
of
the
hermit
and
something
in
your
heart
will
answer
to
them
all
in
the
frosty
stillness
of
october
nights
you
will
see
the
airy
tribes
flitting
across
the
moon
following
the
secret
call
that
guides
them
southward
in
the
calm
brightness
of
winter
sunshine
filling
sheltered
copses
with
warmth
and
cheer
you
will
watch
the
lingering
and
robins
and
playing
at
summer
while
the
chickadees
and
the
juncos
and
the
make
merry
in
the
windswept
fields
in
the
lucent
mornings
of
april
you
will
hear
your
old
friends
coming
home
to
you
phoebe
and
oriole
and
and
and
tanager
and
when
they
call
to
you
and
greet
you
you
will
understand
that
nature
knows
a
secret
for
which
man
has
never
found
a
word
the
secret
that
tells
itself
in
song
the
third
of
the
is
it
bears
neither
flower
nor
fruit
its
leaves
are
hardly
to
be
distinguished
from
the
leaves
of
the
other
vines
perhaps
they
are
a
little
rounder
than
the
snowberry
s
a
little
more
pointed
than
the
s
sometimes
you
might
mistake
them
for
the
one
sometimes
for
the
other
no
marks
of
warning
have
been
written
upon
them
if
you
find
them
it
is
your
fortune
if
you
taste
them
it
is
your
fate
for
as
you
browse
your
way
through
the
forest
nipping
here
and
there
a
rosy
leaf
of
young
a
fragrant
emerald
tip
of
a
twig
of
spicy
birch
if
by
chance
you
pluck
the
leaves
of
and
eat
them
you
will
not
know
what
you
have
done
but
the
enchantment
of
the
will
enter
your
heart
and
the
charm
of
the
wildwood
will
flow
through
your
veins
you
will
never
get
away
from
it
the
sighing
of
the
wind
through
the
and
the
laughter
of
the
stream
in
its
rapids
will
sound
through
all
your
dreams
on
beds
of
silken
softness
you
will
long
for
the
of
whispering
leaves
above
your
head
and
the
smell
of
a
couch
of
at
tables
spread
with
dainty
fare
you
will
be
hungry
for
the
joy
of
the
hunt
and
for
the
angler
s
sylvan
feast
in
proud
cities
you
will
weary
for
the
sight
of
a
mountain
trail
in
great
cathedrals
you
will
think
of
the
long
arching
aisles
of
the
woodland
and
in
the
noisy
solitude
of
crowded
streets
you
will
hone
after
the
friendly
forest
this
is
what
will
happen
to
you
if
you
eat
the
leaves
of
that
little
vine
and
this
is
what
happened
to
luke
dubois
i
the
cabin
by
the
rivers
two
highways
meet
before
the
door
and
a
third
reaches
away
to
the
southward
broad
and
smooth
and
white
but
there
are
no
travellers
passing
by
the
snow
that
has
fallen
during
the
night
is
unbroken
the
pale
february
sunrise
makes
blue
shadows
on
it
sharp
and
jagged
an
outline
of
the
on
the
quarter
of
a
mile
away
in
summer
the
highways
are
dissolved
into
three
wild
rivers
the
river
of
rocks
which
issues
from
the
hills
the
river
of
meadows
which
flows
from
the
great
lake
and
the
river
of
the
way
out
which
runs
down
from
their
to
the
settlements
and
the
little
world
but
in
winter
when
the
ice
is
firm
under
the
snow
and
the
going
is
fine
there
are
no
tracks
upon
the
three
broad
roads
except
the
paths
of
the
caribou
and
the
footprints
of
the
marten
and
the
mink
and
the
fox
and
the
narrow
trails
made
by
luke
dubois
on
his
way
to
and
from
his
cabin
by
the
rivers
he
leaned
in
the
looking
out
behind
him
in
the
shadow
the
fire
was
still
snapping
in
the
little
stove
where
he
had
cooked
his
breakfast
there
was
a
comforting
smell
of
bacon
and
venison
in
the
room
the
stood
on
the
table
here
in
the
corner
were
his
rifle
and
some
of
his
traps
on
the
wall
hung
his
snowshoes
under
the
bunk
was
a
pile
of
skins
on
the
bench
lay
the
book
that
he
had
been
reading
the
evening
before
while
the
snow
was
falling
it
was
a
book
of
veritable
which
told
how
men
had
made
their
way
in
the
world
and
achieved
great
fortunes
and
won
success
by
toiling
hard
at
first
and
then
by
trading
and
bargaining
and
getting
ahead
of
other
men
well
said
luke
to
himself
as
he
stood
at
the
door
i
could
do
that
too
without
doubt
i
also
am
one
of
the
men
who
can
do
things
they
did
not
work
any
harder
than
i
do
but
they
got
better
pay
i
am
for
ten
years
i
have
worked
hard
and
what
have
i
got
for
it
this
he
stepped
out
into
the
morning
alert
and
vigorous
and
the
strength
of
the
hills
had
gone
into
him
and
his
eyes
were
bright
with
health
his
kingdom
was
spread
before
him
there
along
the
river
of
meadows
were
the
haunts
of
the
moose
and
the
caribou
where
he
hunted
in
the
fall
and
yonder
on
the
burnt
hills
around
the
great
lake
were
the
places
where
he
watched
for
the
bears
and
up
beside
the
river
of
rocks
ran
his
line
of
traps
swinging
back
by
secret
ways
to
many
a
nameless
pond
and
hidden
and
all
along
the
streams
when
the
ice
went
out
in
the
spring
the
great
trout
would
be
leaping
in
rapid
and
pool
among
the
peaks
and
valleys
of
that
kingdom
he
could
find
his
way
as
easily
as
a
merchant
walks
from
his
house
to
his
office
the
secrets
of
bird
and
beast
were
known
to
him
every
season
of
the
year
brought
him
its
own
tribute
the
woods
were
his
domain
vast
inexhaustible
free
here
was
his
home
his
cabin
that
he
had
built
with
his
own
hands
the
roof
was
tight
the
walls
were
well
chinked
with
moss
it
was
snug
and
warm
but
small
how
pitifully
small
it
looked
and
how
lonely
his
stood
beside
the
door
and
against
it
leaned
the
axe
he
caught
it
up
and
began
to
split
wood
for
the
stove
no
he
cried
throwing
down
the
axe
i
m
tired
of
this
it
has
lasted
long
enough
i
m
going
out
to
make
my
way
in
the
a
couple
of
hours
later
the
sledge
was
packed
with
and
bundles
of
skins
the
door
of
the
cabin
was
shut
a
ghostlike
wreath
of
blue
smoke
curled
from
the
chimney
luke
stood
in
his
snowshoes
on
the
white
surface
of
the
river
of
the
way
out
he
turned
to
look
back
for
a
moment
and
waved
his
hand
old
cabin
the
rivers
the
woods
ii
the
house
on
the
main
street
all
the
good
houses
in
city
were
different
in
the
number
and
shape
of
the
curious
pinnacles
that
rose
from
their
roofs
and
in
the
trimmings
of
their
verandas
yet
they
were
all
alike
too
in
their
general
expression
of
putting
their
best
foot
foremost
and
feeling
quite
sure
that
they
made
a
brave
show
they
had
lace
curtains
in
their
front
parlour
windows
and
outside
of
the
curtains
were
large
red
and
yellow
pots
of
artificial
flowers
and
indestructible
palms
and
vulcanised
it
was
a
gay
sight
but
by
far
the
bravest
of
these
houses
was
the
residence
of
matthew
wilson
the
principal
merchant
of
city
it
stood
on
a
corner
of
main
street
glancing
slyly
out
of
the
tail
of
one
eye
down
the
street
toward
the
shop
and
the
business
but
keeping
a
bold
complacent
front
toward
the
and
the
smaller
houses
across
the
way
it
might
well
be
satisfied
with
itself
for
it
had
three
more
pinnacles
than
any
of
its
neighbours
and
the
work
of
the
was
looped
and
festooned
all
around
the
eaves
and
porticoes
and
in
amazing
richness
moreover
in
the
front
yard
were
images
painted
white
a
stag
reposing
on
a
diana
properly
dressed
and
returning
from
the
chase
a
small
iron
boy
holding
over
his
head
a
parasol
from
the
ferrule
of
which
a
fountain
squirted
the
paths
were
of
asphalt
gray
and
gritty
in
winter
but
now
in
the
summer
heat
black
and
pulpy
to
the
tread
there
were
many
feet
passing
over
them
this
afternoon
for
and
matthew
wilson
were
giving
a
reception
to
celebrate
the
official
entrance
of
their
daughter
amanda
into
a
social
life
which
she
had
permeated
unofficially
for
several
years
the
house
was
sizzling
full
of
people
those
who
were
jammed
in
the
parlour
tried
to
get
into
the
and
those
who
were
packed
in
the
struggled
to
escape
holding
plates
of
stratified
cake
and
liquefied
high
above
their
neighbours
heads
like
signals
of
danger
and
distress
everybody
was
talking
at
the
same
time
in
a
loud
shrill
voice
and
nobody
listened
to
what
anybody
else
was
saying
but
it
did
not
matter
for
they
all
said
the
same
things
elegant
house
for
a
party
so
full
of
how
perfectly
lovely
amanda
wilson
looks
in
that
awfully
warm
day
were
you
at
the
tompkins
last
wilson
s
emporium
must
be
doing
good
business
to
keep
up
all
this
hear
he
s
going
to
enlarge
the
store
and
take
luke
woods
into
the
shouldn
t
wonder
if
there
might
be
a
wedding
here
before
next
the
tide
of
chatter
rose
and
swelled
and
ebbed
and
suddenly
sank
away
at
six
o
clock
the
minister
and
two
maiden
ladies
in
black
silk
with
lilac
ribbons
laid
down
their
last
plates
of
and
said
they
thought
they
must
be
going
amanda
and
her
mother
preened
their
dresses
and
patted
their
hair
come
into
the
study
said
wilson
to
luke
i
want
to
have
a
talk
with
the
little
bookless
room
called
the
study
was
the
one
that
kept
its
eye
on
the
shop
and
the
business
away
down
the
street
you
could
see
the
brick
front
and
the
windows
and
part
of
the
gilt
sign
pretty
good
store
said
wilson
jingling
the
keys
in
his
pocket
does
the
biggest
trade
in
the
county
biggest
but
one
in
the
whole
state
i
guess
and
i
must
say
luke
woods
you
ve
done
your
share
these
last
five
years
in
building
it
up
never
had
a
clerk
work
so
hard
and
so
steady
you
ve
got
good
business
sense
i
i
m
glad
you
think
so
said
luke
i
did
as
well
as
i
yes
said
the
elder
man
and
now
i
m
about
ready
to
take
you
in
with
me
give
you
a
share
in
the
business
i
want
some
one
to
help
me
run
it
make
it
larger
we
can
double
it
easy
if
we
stick
to
it
and
spread
out
no
reason
why
you
shouldn
t
make
a
fortune
out
of
it
and
have
a
house
just
like
this
on
the
other
corner
when
you
re
my
luke
s
thoughts
were
wandering
a
little
they
went
out
from
the
stuffy
room
beyond
the
dusty
street
and
the
jangling
cars
and
the
gilt
sign
and
the
shop
full
of
and
notions
and
the
high
desks
in
the
office
out
to
the
dim
cool
forest
where
snowberry
and
and
grow
he
heard
the
free
winds
rushing
over
the
and
saw
the
trail
winding
away
before
him
in
the
green
shade
you
are
very
kind
said
he
i
hope
you
will
not
be
disappointed
in
me
sometimes
i
think
perhaps
not
at
all
not
at
all
said
the
other
it
s
all
right
you
re
well
fitted
for
it
and
then
there
s
another
thing
i
guess
you
like
my
daughter
amanda
pretty
well
eh
i
ve
watched
you
young
man
i
ve
had
my
eye
on
you
now
of
course
i
can
t
say
much
about
it
never
can
be
sure
of
these
kind
of
things
you
know
but
if
you
and
she
the
voice
went
on
rolling
out
words
complacently
but
something
strange
was
working
in
luke
s
blood
and
other
voices
were
sounding
faintly
in
his
ears
he
heard
the
lisping
of
the
leaves
on
the
little
the
whistle
of
the
black
duck
s
wings
as
he
circled
in
the
air
the
distant
drumming
of
the
grouse
on
his
log
the
rumble
of
the
in
the
river
of
rocks
the
spray
cooled
his
face
he
saw
the
fish
rising
along
the
pool
and
a
stag
feeding
among
the
i
don
t
know
how
to
thank
you
wilson
said
he
at
last
when
the
elder
man
stopped
talking
you
have
certainly
treated
me
most
generously
the
only
question
is
whether
but
night
i
think
with
your
consent
i
will
speak
to
your
daughter
i
am
going
down
to
the
store
there
is
a
good
deal
of
work
to
do
on
the
but
when
luke
came
to
the
store
he
did
not
go
in
he
walked
along
the
street
till
he
came
to
the
river
the
was
strangely
deserted
everybody
was
at
supper
a
couple
of
schooners
were
moored
at
the
wharf
the
portland
steamer
had
gone
out
the
hung
idle
at
their
little
dock
down
the
river
drifting
and
dancing
lightly
over
the
opalescent
ripples
following
the
gentle
turns
of
the
current
which
flowed
past
the
end
of
the
dock
where
luke
was
standing
came
a
white
canoe
empty
and
astray
iii
the
white
canoe
that
looks
just
like
my
old
canoe
said
he
somebody
must
have
left
it
adrift
up
the
river
i
wonder
how
it
floated
down
here
without
being
picked
he
put
out
his
hand
and
caught
it
as
it
touched
the
dock
in
the
stern
a
good
paddle
of
was
lying
in
the
middle
there
was
a
roll
of
blankets
and
a
pack
of
in
the
bow
a
rifle
all
ready
for
a
trip
he
laughed
nobody
going
but
me
well
then
au
large
and
stepping
into
the
canoe
he
pushed
out
on
the
river
the
saffron
and
golden
lights
in
the
sky
diffused
themselves
over
the
surface
of
the
water
and
spread
from
the
bow
of
the
canoe
in
deeper
waves
of
purple
and
orange
as
he
paddled
swiftly
up
stream
the
pale
yellow
of
the
town
faded
behind
him
the
and
factories
and
disconsolate
little
houses
of
the
outskirts
seemed
to
melt
away
in
a
little
while
he
was
floating
between
dark
walls
of
forest
through
the
heart
of
the
wilderness
the
night
deepened
around
him
and
the
sky
hung
out
its
thousand
lamps
odours
of
the
woods
floated
on
the
air
the
spicy
fragrance
of
the
firs
the
breath
of
hidden
banks
of
muskrats
swam
noiselessly
in
the
shadows
diving
with
a
great
commotion
as
the
canoe
ran
upon
them
suddenly
a
horned
owl
hooted
from
the
branch
of
a
dead
far
back
in
the
forest
a
fox
barked
twice
the
moon
crept
up
behind
the
wall
of
trees
and
touched
the
stream
with
silver
presently
the
forest
receded
the
banks
of
the
river
grew
broad
and
open
the
dew
glistened
on
the
tall
grass
it
was
surely
the
river
of
meadows
far
ahead
of
him
in
a
bend
of
the
stream
luke
s
ear
caught
a
new
sound
slosh
slosh
slosh
as
if
some
heavy
animal
were
crossing
the
wet
meadow
then
a
great
splash
luke
swung
the
canoe
into
the
shadow
of
the
bank
and
paddled
fast
as
he
turned
the
point
a
black
bear
came
out
of
the
river
and
stood
on
the
shore
shaking
the
water
around
him
in
glittering
spray
ping
said
the
rifle
and
the
bear
fell
good
luck
said
luke
i
haven
t
forgotten
how
after
all
i
ll
take
him
into
the
canoe
and
dress
him
up
at
the
yes
there
was
the
little
cabin
at
the
meeting
of
the
rivers
the
door
was
padlocked
but
luke
knew
how
to
pry
off
one
of
the
staples
squirrels
had
made
a
litter
on
the
floor
but
that
was
soon
swept
out
and
a
fire
crackled
in
the
stove
there
was
tea
and
ham
and
bread
in
the
pack
in
the
canoe
supper
never
tasted
better
one
more
night
in
the
old
camp
said
luke
as
he
rolled
himself
in
the
blanket
and
dropped
asleep
in
a
moment
the
sun
shone
in
at
the
door
and
woke
him
i
must
have
a
trout
for
breakfast
he
cried
there
s
one
waiting
for
me
at
the
mouth
of
alder
brook
i
so
he
caught
up
his
rod
from
behind
the
door
and
got
into
the
canoe
and
paddled
up
the
river
of
rocks
there
was
the
broad
dark
pool
like
a
little
lake
with
a
rapid
running
in
at
the
head
and
close
beside
the
rapid
the
mouth
of
the
brook
he
sent
his
fly
out
by
the
edge
of
the
alders
there
was
a
huge
swirl
on
the
water
and
the
of
all
the
trout
in
the
river
was
hooked
up
and
down
the
pool
he
played
for
half
an
hour
until
at
last
the
fight
was
over
and
for
want
of
a
net
luke
beached
him
on
the
gravel
bank
at
the
foot
of
the
pool
seven
pounds
if
it
s
an
ounce
said
he
this
is
my
lucky
day
now
all
i
need
is
some
good
meat
to
provision
the
he
glanced
down
the
river
and
on
the
second
point
below
the
pool
he
saw
a
great
black
bullmoose
with
horns
five
feet
wide
quietly
swiftly
the
canoe
went
gliding
down
the
stream
and
ever
as
it
crept
along
the
moose
loped
easily
before
it
from
point
to
point
from
bay
to
bay
past
the
little
cabin
down
the
river
of
the
way
out
now
rustling
unseen
through
a
bank
of
tall
alders
now
standing
out
for
a
moment
bold
and
black
on
a
beach
of
white
sand
so
all
day
long
the
moose
loped
down
the
stream
and
the
white
canoe
followed
just
as
the
setting
sun
was
poised
above
the
trees
the
great
bull
stopped
and
stood
with
head
lifted
luke
pushed
the
canoe
as
near
as
he
dared
and
looked
down
for
the
rifle
he
had
left
it
at
the
cabin
the
moose
tossed
his
huge
antlers
grunted
and
stepped
quietly
over
the
bushes
into
the
forest
luke
paddled
on
down
the
stream
it
occurred
to
him
suddenly
that
it
was
near
evening
he
wondered
a
little
how
he
should
reach
home
in
time
for
his
engagement
but
it
did
not
seem
strange
as
he
went
swiftly
on
with
the
river
to
see
the
first
houses
of
the
town
and
the
and
the
schooners
at
the
wharf
he
made
the
canoe
fast
at
the
dock
and
went
up
the
main
street
there
was
the
old
shop
but
the
sign
over
it
read
wilson
and
woods
company
the
big
he
went
on
to
the
house
with
the
white
iron
images
in
the
front
yard
diana
was
still
returning
from
the
chase
the
fountain
still
squirted
from
the
point
of
the
little
boy
s
parasol
on
the
veranda
sat
a
stout
man
in
a
rocking
chair
reading
the
newspaper
at
the
side
of
the
house
two
little
girls
with
were
playing
croquet
some
one
in
the
parlour
was
executing
after
the
ball
is
over
on
a
mechanical
piano
luke
accosted
a
stranger
who
passed
him
excuse
me
but
can
you
tell
me
whether
this
is
matthew
wilson
s
house
it
used
to
be
said
the
stranger
but
old
man
wilson
has
been
dead
these
ten
and
who
lives
here
now
asked
luke
mr
woods
he
married
wilson
s
daughter
said
the
stranger
and
went
on
his
way
well
said
luke
to
himself
this
is
just
a
little
queer
woods
was
my
name
for
a
while
when
i
lived
here
but
now
i
suppose
i
m
luke
dubois
again
dashed
if
i
can
understand
it
somebody
must
have
been
so
he
went
back
to
the
white
canoe
and
paddled
away
up
the
river
and
nobody
in
city
ever
set
eyes
on
him
again
the
other
wise
man
you
know
the
story
of
the
three
wise
men
of
the
east
and
how
they
travelled
from
far
away
to
offer
their
gifts
at
the
in
bethlehem
but
have
you
ever
heard
the
story
of
the
other
wise
man
who
also
saw
the
star
in
its
rising
and
set
out
to
follow
it
yet
did
not
arrive
with
his
brethren
in
the
presence
of
the
young
child
jesus
of
the
great
desire
of
this
fourth
pilgrim
and
how
it
was
denied
yet
accomplished
in
the
denial
of
his
many
wanderings
and
the
probations
of
his
soul
of
the
long
way
of
his
seeking
and
the
strange
way
of
his
finding
the
one
whom
he
sought
i
would
tell
the
tale
as
i
have
heard
fragments
of
it
in
the
hall
of
dreams
in
the
palace
of
the
heart
of
man
i
in
the
days
when
augustus
caesar
was
master
of
many
kings
and
herod
reigned
in
jerusalem
there
lived
in
the
city
of
ecbatana
among
the
mountains
of
persia
a
certain
man
named
artaban
his
house
stood
close
to
the
outermost
of
the
walls
which
encircled
the
royal
treasury
from
his
roof
he
could
look
over
the
battlements
of
black
and
white
and
crimson
and
blue
and
red
and
silver
and
gold
to
the
hill
where
the
summer
palace
of
the
parthian
emperors
glittered
like
a
jewel
in
a
crown
around
the
dwelling
of
artaban
spread
a
fair
garden
a
tangle
of
flowers
and
watered
by
a
score
of
streams
descending
from
the
slopes
of
mount
orontes
and
made
musical
by
innumerable
birds
but
all
colour
was
lost
in
the
soft
and
odorous
darkness
of
the
late
september
night
and
all
sounds
were
hushed
in
the
deep
charm
of
its
silence
save
the
plashing
of
the
water
like
a
voice
and
under
the
shadows
high
above
the
trees
a
dim
glow
of
light
shone
through
the
curtained
arches
of
the
upper
chamber
where
the
master
of
the
house
was
holding
council
with
his
friends
he
stood
by
the
doorway
to
greet
his
guests
a
tall
dark
man
of
about
forty
years
with
brilliant
eyes
set
near
together
under
his
broad
brow
and
firm
lines
graven
around
his
fine
thin
lips
the
brow
of
a
dreamer
and
the
mouth
of
a
soldier
a
man
of
sensitive
feeling
but
inflexible
will
one
of
those
who
in
whatever
age
they
may
live
are
born
for
inward
conflict
and
a
life
of
quest
his
robe
was
of
pure
white
wool
thrown
over
a
tunic
of
silk
and
a
white
pointed
cap
with
long
lapels
at
the
sides
rested
on
his
flowing
black
hair
it
was
the
dress
of
the
ancient
priesthood
of
the
magi
called
the
welcome
he
said
in
his
low
pleasant
voice
as
one
after
another
entered
the
room
welcome
abdus
peace
be
with
you
rhodaspes
and
tigranes
and
with
you
my
father
abgarus
you
are
all
welcome
this
house
grows
bright
with
the
joy
of
your
there
were
nine
of
the
men
differing
widely
in
age
but
alike
in
the
richness
of
their
dress
of
silks
and
in
the
massive
golden
collars
around
their
necks
marking
them
as
parthian
nobles
and
in
the
winged
circles
of
gold
resting
upon
their
breasts
the
sign
of
the
followers
of
zoroaster
they
took
their
places
around
a
small
black
altar
at
the
end
of
the
room
where
a
tiny
flame
was
burning
artaban
standing
beside
it
and
waving
a
barsom
of
thin
tamarisk
branches
above
the
fire
fed
it
with
dry
sticks
of
pine
and
fragrant
oils
then
he
began
the
ancient
chant
of
the
yasna
and
the
voices
of
his
companions
joined
in
the
hymn
to
we
worship
the
spirit
divine
all
wisdom
and
goodness
possessing
surrounded
by
holy
immortals
the
givers
of
bounty
and
blessing
we
joy
in
the
work
of
his
hands
his
truth
and
his
power
confessing
we
praise
all
the
things
that
are
pure
for
these
are
his
only
creation
the
thoughts
that
are
true
and
the
words
and
the
deeds
that
have
won
approbation
these
are
supported
by
him
and
for
these
we
make
adoration
hear
us
o
mazda
thou
livest
in
truth
and
in
heavenly
gladness
cleanse
us
from
falsehood
and
keep
us
from
evil
and
bondage
to
badness
pour
out
the
light
and
the
joy
of
thy
life
on
our
darkness
and
sadness
shine
on
our
gardens
and
fields
shine
on
our
working
and
waving
shine
on
the
whole
race
of
man
believing
and
unbelieving
shine
on
us
now
through
the
night
shine
on
us
now
in
thy
might
the
flame
of
our
holy
love
and
the
song
of
our
worship
receiving
the
fire
rose
with
the
chant
throbbing
as
if
the
flame
responded
to
the
music
until
it
cast
a
bright
illumination
through
the
whole
apartment
revealing
its
simplicity
and
splendour
the
floor
was
laid
with
tiles
of
dark
blue
veined
with
white
pilasters
of
twisted
silver
stood
out
against
the
blue
walls
the
of
windows
above
them
was
hung
with
azure
silk
the
vaulted
ceiling
was
a
pavement
of
blue
stones
like
the
body
of
heaven
in
its
clearness
sown
with
silver
stars
from
the
four
corners
of
the
roof
hung
four
golden
called
the
tongues
of
the
gods
at
the
eastern
end
behind
the
altar
there
were
two
pillars
of
porphyry
above
them
a
lintel
of
the
same
stone
on
which
was
carved
the
figure
of
a
winged
archer
with
his
arrow
set
to
the
string
and
his
bow
drawn
the
doorway
between
the
pillars
which
opened
upon
the
terrace
of
the
roof
was
covered
with
a
heavy
curtain
of
the
colour
of
a
ripe
pomegranate
embroidered
with
innumerable
golden
rays
shooting
upward
from
the
floor
in
effect
the
room
was
like
a
quiet
starry
night
all
azure
and
silver
flushed
in
the
cast
with
rosy
promise
of
the
dawn
it
was
as
the
house
of
a
man
should
be
an
expression
of
the
character
and
spirit
of
the
master
he
turned
to
his
friends
when
the
song
was
ended
and
invited
them
to
be
seated
on
the
divan
at
the
western
end
of
the
room
you
have
come
said
he
looking
around
the
circle
at
my
call
as
the
faithful
scholars
of
zoroaster
to
renew
your
worship
and
rekindle
your
faith
in
the
god
of
purity
even
as
this
fire
has
been
rekindled
on
the
altar
we
worship
not
the
fire
but
him
of
whom
it
is
the
chosen
symbol
because
it
is
the
purest
of
all
created
things
it
speaks
to
us
of
one
who
is
light
and
truth
is
it
not
so
my
father
it
is
well
said
my
son
answered
the
venerable
abgarus
the
enlightened
are
never
idolaters
they
lift
the
veil
of
form
and
go
in
to
the
shrine
of
reality
and
new
light
and
truth
are
coming
to
them
continually
through
the
old
hear
me
then
my
father
an
while
i
tell
you
of
the
new
light
and
truth
that
have
come
to
me
through
the
most
ancient
of
all
signs
we
have
searched
the
secrets
of
nature
together
and
studied
the
healing
virtues
of
water
and
fire
and
the
plants
we
have
read
also
the
books
of
prophecy
in
which
the
future
is
dimly
foretold
in
words
that
are
hard
to
understand
but
the
highest
of
all
learning
is
the
knowledge
of
the
stars
to
trace
their
course
is
to
untangle
the
threads
of
the
mystery
of
life
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
if
we
could
follow
them
perfectly
nothing
would
be
hidden
from
us
but
is
not
our
knowledge
of
them
still
incomplete
are
there
not
many
stars
still
beyond
our
horizon
lights
that
are
known
only
to
the
dwellers
in
the
far
among
the
of
punt
and
the
gold
mines
of
ophir
there
was
a
murmur
of
assent
among
the
listeners
the
stars
said
tigranes
are
the
thoughts
of
the
eternal
they
are
numberless
but
the
thoughts
of
man
can
be
counted
like
the
years
of
his
life
the
wisdom
of
the
magi
is
the
greatest
of
all
wisdoms
on
earth
because
it
knows
its
own
ignorance
and
that
is
the
secret
of
power
we
keep
men
always
looking
and
waiting
for
a
new
sunrise
but
we
ourselves
understand
that
the
darkness
is
equal
to
the
light
and
that
the
conflict
between
them
will
never
be
that
does
not
satisfy
me
answered
artaban
for
if
the
waiting
must
be
endless
if
there
could
be
no
fulfilment
of
it
then
it
would
not
be
wisdom
to
look
and
wait
we
should
become
like
those
new
teachers
of
the
greeks
who
say
that
there
is
no
truth
and
that
the
only
wise
men
are
those
who
spend
their
lives
in
discovering
and
exposing
the
lies
that
have
been
believed
in
the
world
but
the
new
sunrise
will
certainly
appear
in
the
appointed
time
do
not
our
own
books
tell
us
that
this
will
come
to
pass
and
that
men
will
see
the
brightness
of
a
great
light
that
is
true
said
the
voice
of
abgarus
every
faithful
disciple
of
zoroaster
knows
the
prophecy
of
the
avesta
and
carries
the
word
in
his
heart
in
that
day
sosiosh
the
victorious
shall
arise
out
of
the
number
of
the
prophets
in
the
east
country
around
him
shall
shine
a
mighty
brightness
and
he
shall
make
life
everlasting
incorruptible
and
immortal
and
the
dead
shall
rise
this
is
a
dark
saying
said
tigranes
and
it
may
be
that
we
shall
never
understand
it
it
is
better
to
consider
the
things
that
are
near
at
hand
and
to
increase
the
influence
of
the
magi
in
their
own
country
rather
than
to
look
for
one
who
may
be
a
stranger
and
to
whom
we
must
resign
our
the
others
seemed
to
approve
these
words
there
was
a
silent
feeling
of
agreement
manifest
among
them
their
looks
responded
with
that
indefinable
expression
which
always
follows
when
a
speaker
has
uttered
the
thought
that
has
been
slumbering
in
the
hearts
of
his
listeners
but
artaban
turned
to
abgarus
with
a
glow
on
his
face
and
said
my
father
i
have
kept
this
prophecy
in
the
secret
place
of
my
soul
religion
without
a
great
hope
would
be
like
an
altar
without
a
living
fire
and
now
the
flame
has
burned
more
brightly
and
by
the
light
of
it
i
have
read
other
words
which
also
have
come
from
the
fountain
of
truth
and
speak
yet
more
clearly
of
the
rising
of
the
victorious
one
in
his
he
drew
from
the
breast
of
his
tunic
two
small
rolls
of
fine
parchment
with
writing
upon
them
and
unfolded
them
carefully
upon
his
knee
in
the
years
that
are
lost
in
the
past
long
before
our
fathers
came
into
the
land
of
babylon
there
were
wise
men
in
chaldea
from
whom
the
first
of
the
magi
learned
the
secret
of
the
heavens
and
of
these
balaam
the
son
of
beor
was
one
of
the
mightiest
hear
the
words
of
his
prophecy
there
shall
come
a
star
out
of
jacob
and
a
sceptre
shall
arise
out
of
the
lips
of
tigranes
drew
downward
with
contempt
as
he
said
judah
was
a
captive
by
the
waters
of
babylon
and
the
sons
of
jacob
were
in
bondage
to
our
kings
the
tribes
of
israel
are
scattered
through
the
mountains
like
lost
sheep
and
from
the
remnant
that
dwells
in
judea
under
the
yoke
of
rome
neither
star
nor
sceptre
shall
and
yet
answered
artaban
it
was
the
hebrew
daniel
the
mighty
searcher
of
dreams
the
counsellor
of
kings
the
wise
belteshazzar
who
was
most
honoured
and
beloved
of
our
great
king
cyrus
a
prophet
of
sure
things
and
a
reader
of
the
thoughts
of
the
eternal
daniel
proved
himself
to
our
people
and
these
are
the
words
that
he
artaban
read
from
the
second
roll
know
therefore
and
understand
that
from
the
going
forth
of
the
commandment
to
restore
jerusalem
unto
the
anointed
one
the
prince
the
time
shall
be
seven
and
threescore
and
two
but
my
son
said
abgarus
doubtfully
these
are
mystical
numbers
who
can
interpret
them
or
who
can
find
the
key
that
shall
unlock
their
meaning
artaban
answered
it
has
been
shown
to
me
and
to
my
three
companions
among
the
magi
caspar
melchior
and
balthazar
we
have
searched
the
ancient
tablets
of
chaldea
and
computed
the
time
it
falls
in
this
year
we
have
studied
the
sky
and
in
the
spring
of
the
year
we
saw
two
of
the
greatest
planets
draw
near
together
in
the
sign
of
the
fish
which
is
the
house
of
the
hebrews
we
also
saw
a
new
star
there
which
shone
for
one
night
and
then
vanished
now
again
the
two
great
planets
are
meeting
this
night
is
their
conjunction
my
three
brothers
are
watching
by
the
ancient
temple
of
the
seven
spheres
at
borsippa
in
babylonia
and
i
am
watching
here
if
the
star
shines
again
they
will
wait
ten
days
for
me
at
the
temple
and
then
we
will
set
out
together
for
jerusalem
to
see
and
worship
the
promised
one
who
shall
be
born
king
of
israel
i
believe
the
sign
will
come
i
have
made
ready
for
the
journey
i
have
sold
my
possessions
and
bought
these
three
jewels
a
sapphire
a
ruby
and
a
pearl
to
carry
them
as
tribute
to
the
king
and
i
ask
you
to
go
with
me
on
the
pilgrimage
that
we
may
have
joy
together
in
finding
the
prince
who
is
worthy
to
be
while
he
was
speaking
he
thrust
his
hand
into
the
inmost
fold
of
his
girdle
and
drew
out
three
great
gems
one
blue
as
a
fragment
of
the
night
sky
one
redder
than
a
ray
of
sunrise
and
one
as
pure
as
the
peak
of
a
at
twilight
and
laid
them
on
the
outspread
scrolls
before
him
but
his
friends
looked
on
with
strange
and
alien
eyes
a
veil
of
doubt
and
mistrust
came
over
their
faces
like
a
fog
creeping
up
from
the
marshes
to
hide
the
hills
they
glanced
at
each
other
with
looks
of
wonder
and
pity
as
those
who
have
listened
to
incredible
sayings
the
story
of
a
wild
vision
or
the
proposal
of
an
impossible
enterprise
at
last
tigranes
said
artaban
this
is
a
vain
dream
it
comes
from
too
much
looking
upon
the
stars
and
the
cherishing
of
lofty
thoughts
it
would
be
wiser
to
spend
the
time
in
gathering
money
for
the
new
at
chala
no
king
will
ever
rise
from
the
broken
race
of
israel
and
no
end
will
ever
come
to
the
eternal
strife
of
light
and
darkness
he
who
looks
for
it
is
a
chaser
of
shadows
and
another
said
artaban
i
have
no
knowledge
of
these
things
and
my
office
as
guardian
of
the
royal
treasure
binds
me
here
the
quest
is
not
for
me
but
if
thou
must
follow
it
fare
thee
and
another
said
in
my
house
there
sleeps
a
new
bride
and
i
can
not
leave
her
nor
take
her
with
me
on
this
strange
journey
this
quest
is
not
for
me
but
may
thy
steps
be
prospered
wherever
thou
goest
so
and
another
said
i
am
ill
and
unfit
for
hardship
but
there
is
a
man
among
my
servants
whom
i
will
send
with
thee
when
thou
goest
to
bring
me
word
how
thou
so
one
by
one
they
left
the
house
of
artaban
but
abgarus
the
oldest
and
the
one
who
loved
him
the
best
lingered
after
the
others
had
gone
and
said
gravely
my
son
it
may
be
that
the
light
of
truth
is
in
this
sign
that
has
appeared
in
the
skies
and
then
it
will
surely
lead
to
the
prince
and
the
mighty
brightness
or
it
may
be
that
it
is
only
a
shadow
of
the
light
as
tigranes
has
said
and
then
he
who
follows
it
will
have
a
long
pilgrimage
and
a
fruitless
search
but
it
is
better
to
follow
even
the
shadow
of
the
best
than
to
remain
content
with
the
worst
and
those
who
would
see
wonderful
things
must
often
be
ready
to
travel
alone
i
am
too
old
for
this
journey
but
my
heart
shall
be
a
companion
of
thy
pilgrimage
day
and
night
and
i
shall
know
the
end
of
thy
quest
go
in
then
abgarus
went
out
of
the
azure
chamber
with
its
silver
stars
and
artaban
was
left
in
solitude
he
gathered
up
the
jewels
and
replaced
them
in
his
girdle
for
a
long
time
he
stood
and
watched
the
flame
that
flickered
and
sank
upon
the
altar
then
he
crossed
the
hall
lifted
the
heavy
curtain
and
passed
out
between
the
pillars
of
porphyry
to
the
terrace
on
the
roof
the
shiver
that
runs
through
the
earth
ere
she
rouses
from
her
had
already
begun
and
the
cool
wind
that
heralds
the
daybreak
was
drawing
downward
from
the
lofty
ravines
of
mount
orontes
birds
crept
and
chirped
among
the
rustling
leaves
and
the
smell
of
ripened
grapes
came
in
brief
wafts
from
the
arbours
far
over
the
eastern
plain
a
white
mist
stretched
like
a
lake
but
where
the
distant
peaks
of
zagros
serrated
the
western
horizon
the
sky
was
clear
jupiter
and
saturn
rolled
together
like
drops
of
lambent
flame
about
to
blend
in
one
as
artaban
watched
them
a
spark
was
born
out
of
the
darkness
beneath
rounding
itself
with
purple
splendours
to
a
crimson
sphere
and
spiring
upward
through
rays
of
saffron
and
orange
into
a
point
of
white
radiance
tiny
and
infinitely
remote
yet
perfect
in
every
part
it
pulsated
in
the
enormous
vault
as
if
the
three
jewels
in
the
magian
s
girdle
had
mingled
and
been
transformed
into
a
living
heart
of
light
he
bowed
his
head
he
covered
his
brow
with
his
hands
it
is
the
sign
he
said
the
king
is
coming
and
i
will
go
to
meet
ii
all
night
long
vasda
the
swiftest
of
artaban
s
horses
had
been
waiting
saddled
and
bridled
in
her
stall
pawing
the
ground
impatiently
and
shaking
her
bit
as
if
she
shared
the
eagerness
of
her
master
s
purpose
though
she
knew
not
its
meaning
before
the
birds
had
fully
roused
to
their
strong
high
joyful
chant
of
morning
song
before
the
white
mist
had
begun
to
lift
lazily
from
the
plain
the
other
wise
man
was
in
the
saddle
riding
swiftly
along
the
which
skirted
the
base
of
mount
orontes
westward
how
close
how
intimate
is
the
comradeship
between
a
man
and
his
favourite
horse
on
a
long
journey
it
is
a
silent
comprehensive
friendship
an
intercourse
beyond
the
need
of
words
they
drink
at
the
same
springs
and
sleep
under
the
same
guardian
stars
they
are
conscious
together
of
the
subduing
spell
of
nightfall
and
the
quickening
joy
of
daybreak
the
master
shares
his
evening
meal
with
his
hungry
companion
and
feels
the
soft
moist
lips
caressing
the
palm
of
his
hand
as
they
close
over
the
morsel
of
bread
in
the
gray
dawn
he
is
roused
from
his
bivouac
by
the
gentle
stir
of
a
warm
sweet
breath
over
his
sleeping
face
and
looks
up
into
the
eyes
of
his
faithful
ready
and
waiting
for
the
toil
of
the
day
surely
unless
he
is
a
pagan
and
an
unbeliever
by
whatever
name
he
calls
upon
his
god
he
will
thank
him
for
this
voiceless
sympathy
this
dumb
affection
and
his
morning
prayer
will
embrace
a
double
blessing
god
bless
us
both
the
horse
and
the
rider
and
keep
our
feet
from
falling
and
our
souls
from
death
then
through
the
keen
morning
air
the
swift
hoofs
beat
their
tattoo
along
the
road
keeping
time
to
the
pulsing
of
two
hearts
that
are
moved
with
the
same
eager
desire
to
conquer
space
to
devour
the
distance
to
attain
the
goal
of
the
journey
artaban
must
indeed
ride
wisely
and
well
if
he
would
keep
the
appointed
hour
with
the
other
magi
for
the
route
was
a
hundred
and
fifty
parasangs
and
fifteen
was
the
utmost
that
he
could
travel
in
a
day
but
he
knew
vasda
s
strength
and
pushed
forward
without
anxiety
making
the
fixed
distance
every
day
though
he
must
travel
late
into
the
night
and
in
the
morning
long
before
sunrise
he
passed
along
the
brown
slopes
of
mount
orontes
furrowed
by
the
rocky
courses
of
a
hundred
torrents
he
crossed
the
level
plains
of
the
nisaeans
where
the
famous
herds
of
horses
feeding
in
the
wide
pastures
tossed
their
heads
at
vasda
s
approach
and
galloped
away
with
a
thunder
of
many
hoofs
and
flocks
of
wild
birds
rose
suddenly
from
the
swampy
meadows
wheeling
in
great
circles
with
a
shining
flutter
of
innumerable
wings
and
shrill
cries
of
surprise
he
traversed
the
fertile
fields
of
concabar
where
the
dust
from
the
filled
the
air
with
a
golden
mist
half
hiding
the
huge
temple
of
astarte
with
its
four
hundred
pillars
at
baghistan
among
the
rich
gardens
watered
by
fountains
from
the
rock
he
looked
up
at
the
mountain
thrusting
its
immense
rugged
brow
out
over
the
road
and
saw
the
figure
of
king
darius
trampling
upon
his
fallen
foes
and
the
proud
list
of
his
wars
and
conquests
graven
high
upon
the
face
of
the
eternal
cliff
over
many
a
cold
and
desolate
pass
crawling
painfully
across
the
shoulders
of
the
hills
down
many
a
black
where
the
river
roared
and
raced
before
him
like
a
savage
guide
across
many
a
smiling
vale
with
terraces
of
yellow
limestone
full
of
vines
and
through
the
of
carine
and
the
dark
gates
of
zagros
walled
in
by
precipices
into
the
ancient
city
of
chala
where
the
people
of
samaria
had
been
kept
in
captivity
long
ago
and
out
again
by
the
mighty
portal
riven
through
the
encircling
hills
where
he
saw
the
image
of
the
high
priest
of
the
magi
sculptured
on
the
wall
of
rock
with
hand
uplifted
as
if
to
bless
the
centuries
of
pilgrims
past
the
entrance
of
the
narrow
defile
filled
from
end
to
end
with
orchards
of
peaches
and
figs
through
which
the
river
gyndes
foamed
down
to
meet
him
over
the
broad
where
the
autumnal
vapours
spread
their
deathly
mists
following
along
the
course
of
the
river
under
tremulous
shadows
of
poplar
and
tamarind
among
the
lower
hills
and
out
upon
the
flat
plain
where
the
road
ran
straight
as
an
arrow
through
the
and
parched
meadows
past
the
city
of
ctesiphon
where
the
parthian
emperors
reigned
and
the
vast
metropolis
of
seleucia
which
alexander
built
across
the
swirling
floods
of
tigris
and
the
many
channels
of
euphrates
flowing
yellow
through
the
artaban
pressed
onward
until
he
arrived
at
nightfall
on
the
tenth
day
beneath
the
shattered
walls
of
populous
babylon
vasda
was
almost
spent
and
artaban
would
gladly
have
turned
into
the
city
to
find
rest
and
refreshment
for
himself
and
for
her
but
he
knew
that
it
was
three
hours
journey
yet
to
the
temple
of
the
seven
spheres
and
he
must
reach
the
place
by
midnight
if
he
would
find
his
comrades
waiting
so
he
did
not
halt
but
rode
steadily
across
the
a
grove
of
made
an
island
of
gloom
in
the
pale
yellow
sea
as
she
passed
into
the
shadow
vasda
slackened
her
pace
and
began
to
pick
her
way
more
carefully
near
the
farther
end
of
the
darkness
an
access
of
caution
seemed
to
fall
upon
her
she
scented
some
danger
or
difficulty
it
was
not
in
her
heart
to
fly
from
it
only
to
be
prepared
for
it
and
to
meet
it
wisely
as
a
good
horse
should
do
the
grove
was
close
and
silent
as
the
tomb
not
a
leaf
rustled
not
a
bird
sang
she
felt
her
steps
before
her
delicately
carrying
her
head
low
and
sighing
now
and
then
with
apprehension
at
last
she
gave
a
quick
breath
of
anxiety
and
dismay
and
stood
quivering
in
every
muscle
before
a
dark
object
in
the
shadow
of
the
last
artaban
dismounted
the
dim
starlight
revealed
the
form
of
a
man
lying
across
the
road
his
humble
dress
and
the
outline
of
his
haggard
face
showed
that
he
was
probably
one
of
the
hebrews
who
still
dwelt
in
great
numbers
around
the
city
his
pallid
skin
dry
and
yellow
as
parchment
bore
the
mark
of
the
deadly
fever
which
ravaged
the
in
autumn
the
chill
of
death
was
in
his
lean
hand
and
as
artaban
released
it
the
arm
fell
back
inertly
upon
the
motionless
breast
he
turned
away
with
a
thought
of
pity
leaving
the
body
to
that
strange
burial
which
the
magians
deemed
most
fitting
the
funeral
of
the
desert
from
which
the
kites
and
vultures
rise
on
dark
wings
and
the
beasts
of
prey
slink
furtively
away
when
they
are
gone
there
is
only
a
heap
of
white
bones
on
the
sand
but
as
he
turned
a
long
faint
ghostly
sigh
came
from
the
man
s
lips
the
bony
fingers
gripped
the
hem
of
the
magian
s
robe
and
held
him
fast
artaban
s
heart
leaped
to
his
throat
not
with
fear
but
with
a
dumb
resentment
at
the
importunity
of
this
blind
delay
how
could
he
stay
here
in
the
darkness
to
minister
to
a
dying
stranger
what
claim
had
this
unknown
fragment
of
human
life
upon
his
compassion
or
his
service
if
he
lingered
but
for
an
hour
he
could
hardly
reach
borsippa
at
the
appointed
time
his
companions
would
think
he
had
given
up
the
journey
they
would
go
without
him
he
would
lose
his
quest
but
if
he
went
on
now
the
man
would
surely
die
if
artaban
stayed
life
might
be
restored
his
spirit
throbbed
and
fluttered
with
the
urgency
of
the
crisis
should
he
risk
the
great
reward
of
his
faith
for
the
sake
of
a
single
deed
of
charity
should
he
turn
aside
if
only
for
a
moment
from
the
following
of
the
star
to
give
a
cup
of
cold
water
to
a
poor
perishing
hebrew
god
of
truth
and
purity
he
prayed
direct
me
in
the
holy
path
the
way
of
wisdom
which
thou
only
then
he
turned
back
to
the
sick
man
loosening
the
grasp
of
his
hand
he
carried
him
to
a
little
mound
at
the
foot
of
the
he
unbound
the
thick
folds
of
the
turban
and
opened
the
garment
above
the
sunken
breast
he
brought
water
from
one
of
the
small
canals
near
by
and
moistened
the
sufferer
s
brow
and
mouth
he
mingled
a
draught
of
one
of
those
simple
but
potent
remedies
which
he
carried
always
in
his
girdle
for
the
magians
were
physicians
as
well
as
astrologers
and
poured
it
slowly
between
the
colourless
lips
hour
after
hour
he
laboured
as
only
a
skilful
healer
of
disease
can
do
at
last
the
man
s
strength
returned
he
sat
up
and
looked
about
him
who
art
thou
he
said
in
the
rude
dialect
of
the
country
and
why
hast
thou
sought
me
here
to
bring
back
my
life
i
am
artaban
the
magian
of
the
city
of
ecbatana
and
i
am
going
to
jerusalem
in
search
of
one
who
is
to
be
born
king
of
the
jews
a
great
prince
and
deliverer
of
all
men
i
dare
not
delay
any
longer
upon
my
journey
for
the
caravan
that
has
waited
for
me
may
depart
without
me
but
see
here
is
all
that
i
have
left
of
bread
and
wine
and
here
is
a
potion
of
healing
herbs
when
thy
strength
is
restored
thou
canst
find
the
dwellings
of
the
hebrews
among
the
houses
of
the
jew
raised
his
trembling
hand
solemnly
to
heaven
now
may
the
god
of
abraham
and
isaac
and
jacob
bless
and
prosper
the
journey
of
the
merciful
and
bring
him
in
peace
to
his
desired
haven
stay
i
have
nothing
to
give
thee
in
return
only
this
that
i
can
tell
thee
where
the
messiah
must
be
sought
for
our
prophets
have
said
that
he
should
be
born
not
in
jerusalem
but
in
bethlehem
of
judah
may
the
lord
bring
thee
in
safety
to
that
place
because
thou
hast
had
pity
upon
the
it
was
already
long
past
midnight
artaban
rode
in
haste
and
vasda
restored
by
the
brief
rest
ran
eagerly
through
the
silent
plain
and
swam
the
channels
of
the
river
she
put
forth
the
remnant
of
her
strength
and
fled
over
the
ground
like
a
gazelle
but
the
first
beam
of
the
rising
sun
sent
a
long
shadow
before
her
as
she
entered
upon
the
final
stadium
of
the
journey
and
the
eyes
of
artaban
anxiously
scanning
the
great
mound
of
nimrod
and
the
temple
of
the
seven
spheres
could
discern
no
trace
of
his
friends
the
terraces
of
black
and
orange
and
red
and
yellow
and
green
and
blue
and
white
shattered
by
the
convulsions
of
nature
and
crumbling
under
the
repeated
blows
of
human
violence
still
glittered
like
a
ruined
rainbow
in
the
morning
light
artaban
rode
swiftly
around
the
hill
he
dismounted
and
climbed
to
the
highest
terrace
looking
out
toward
the
west
the
huge
desolation
of
the
marshes
stretched
away
to
the
horizon
and
the
border
of
the
desert
bitterns
stood
by
the
stagnant
pools
and
jackals
skulked
through
the
low
bushes
but
there
was
no
sign
of
the
caravan
of
the
wise
men
far
or
near
at
the
edge
of
the
terrace
he
saw
a
little
cairn
of
broken
bricks
and
under
them
a
piece
of
papyrus
he
caught
it
up
and
read
we
have
waited
past
the
midnight
and
can
delay
no
longer
we
go
to
find
the
king
follow
us
across
the
artaban
sat
down
upon
the
ground
and
covered
his
head
in
despair
how
can
i
cross
the
desert
said
he
with
no
food
and
with
a
spent
horse
i
must
return
to
babylon
sell
my
sapphire
and
buy
a
train
of
camels
and
provision
for
the
journey
i
may
never
overtake
my
friends
only
god
the
merciful
knows
whether
i
shall
not
lose
the
sight
of
the
king
because
i
tarried
to
show
iii
there
was
a
silence
in
the
hall
of
dreams
where
i
was
listening
to
the
story
of
the
other
wise
man
through
this
silence
i
saw
but
very
dimly
his
figure
passing
over
the
dreary
undulations
of
the
desert
high
upon
the
back
of
his
camel
rocking
steadily
onward
like
a
ship
over
the
waves
the
land
of
death
spread
its
cruel
net
around
him
the
stony
waste
bore
no
fruit
but
briers
and
thorns
the
dark
ledges
of
rock
thrust
themselves
above
the
surface
here
and
there
like
the
bones
of
perished
monsters
arid
and
inhospitable
rose
before
him
furrowed
with
dry
channels
of
ancient
torrents
white
and
ghastly
as
scars
on
the
face
of
nature
shifting
hills
of
treacherous
sand
were
heaped
like
tombs
along
the
horizon
by
day
the
fierce
heat
pressed
its
intolerable
burden
on
the
quivering
air
no
living
creature
moved
on
the
dumb
swooning
earth
but
tiny
jerboas
scuttling
through
the
parched
bushes
or
lizards
vanishing
in
the
clefts
of
the
rock
by
night
the
jackals
prowled
and
barked
in
the
distance
and
the
lion
made
the
black
ravines
echo
with
his
hollow
roaring
while
a
bitter
blighting
chill
followed
the
fever
of
the
day
through
heat
and
cold
the
magian
moved
steadily
onward
then
i
saw
the
gardens
and
orchards
of
damascus
watered
by
the
streams
of
abana
and
pharpar
with
their
sloping
swards
inlaid
with
bloom
and
their
thickets
of
myrrh
and
roses
i
saw
the
long
snowy
ridge
of
hermon
and
the
dark
groves
of
cedars
and
the
valley
of
the
jordan
and
the
blue
waters
of
the
lake
of
galilee
and
the
fertile
plain
of
esdraelon
and
the
hills
of
ephraim
and
the
highlands
of
judah
through
all
these
i
followed
the
figure
of
artaban
moving
steadily
onward
until
he
arrived
at
bethlehem
and
it
was
the
third
day
after
the
three
wise
men
had
come
to
that
place
and
had
found
mary
and
joseph
with
the
young
child
jesus
and
had
laid
their
gifts
of
gold
and
frankincense
and
myrrh
at
his
feet
then
the
other
wise
man
drew
near
weary
but
full
of
hope
bearing
his
ruby
and
his
pearl
to
offer
to
the
king
for
now
at
last
he
said
i
shall
surely
find
him
though
i
be
alone
and
later
than
my
brethren
this
is
the
place
of
which
the
hebrew
exile
told
me
that
the
prophets
had
spoken
and
here
i
shall
behold
the
rising
of
the
great
light
but
i
must
inquire
about
the
visit
of
my
brethren
and
to
what
house
the
star
directed
them
and
to
whom
they
presented
their
the
streets
of
the
village
seemed
to
be
deserted
and
artaban
wondered
whether
the
men
had
all
gone
up
to
the
to
bring
down
their
sheep
from
the
open
door
of
a
cottage
he
heard
the
sound
of
a
woman
s
voice
singing
softly
he
entered
and
found
a
young
mother
hushing
her
baby
to
rest
she
told
him
of
the
strangers
from
the
far
east
who
had
appeared
in
the
village
three
days
ago
and
how
they
said
that
a
star
had
guided
them
to
the
place
where
joseph
of
nazareth
was
lodging
with
his
wife
and
her
child
and
how
they
had
paid
reverence
to
the
child
and
given
him
many
rich
gifts
but
the
travellers
disappeared
again
she
continued
as
suddenly
as
they
had
come
we
were
afraid
at
the
strangeness
of
their
visit
we
could
not
understand
it
the
man
of
nazareth
took
the
child
and
his
mother
and
fled
away
that
same
night
secretly
and
it
was
whispered
that
they
were
going
to
egypt
ever
since
there
has
been
a
spell
upon
the
village
something
evil
hangs
over
it
they
say
that
the
roman
soldiers
are
coming
from
jerusalem
to
force
a
new
tax
from
us
and
the
men
have
driven
the
flocks
and
herds
far
back
among
the
hills
and
hidden
themselves
to
escape
artaban
listened
to
her
gentle
timid
speech
and
the
child
in
her
arms
looked
up
in
his
face
and
smiled
stretching
out
its
rosy
hands
to
grasp
at
the
winged
circle
of
gold
on
his
breast
his
heart
warmed
to
the
touch
it
seemed
like
a
greeting
of
love
and
trust
to
one
who
had
journeyed
long
in
loneliness
and
perplexity
fighting
with
his
own
doubts
and
fears
and
following
a
light
that
was
veiled
in
clouds
why
might
not
this
child
have
been
the
promised
prince
he
asked
within
himself
as
he
touched
its
soft
cheek
kings
have
been
born
ere
now
in
lowlier
houses
than
this
and
the
favourite
of
the
stars
may
rise
even
from
a
cottage
but
it
has
not
seemed
good
to
the
god
of
wisdom
to
reward
my
search
so
soon
and
so
easily
the
one
whom
i
seek
has
gone
before
me
and
now
i
must
follow
the
king
to
the
young
mother
laid
the
baby
in
its
cradle
and
rose
to
minister
to
the
wants
of
the
strange
guest
that
fate
had
brought
into
her
house
she
set
food
before
him
the
plain
fare
of
peasants
but
willingly
offered
and
therefore
full
of
refreshment
for
the
soul
as
well
as
for
the
body
artaban
accepted
it
gratefully
and
as
he
ate
the
child
fell
into
a
happy
slumber
and
murmured
sweetly
in
its
dreams
and
a
great
peace
filled
the
room
but
suddenly
there
came
the
noise
of
a
wild
confusion
in
the
streets
of
the
village
a
shrieking
and
wailing
of
women
s
voices
a
clangour
of
brazen
trumpets
and
a
clashing
of
swords
and
a
desperate
cry
the
soldiers
the
soldiers
of
herod
they
are
killing
our
the
young
mother
s
face
grew
white
with
terror
she
clasped
her
child
to
her
bosom
and
crouched
motionless
in
the
darkest
corner
of
the
room
covering
him
with
the
folds
of
her
robe
lest
he
should
wake
and
cry
but
artaban
went
quickly
and
stood
in
the
doorway
of
the
house
his
broad
shoulders
filled
the
portal
from
side
to
side
and
the
peak
of
his
white
cap
all
but
touched
the
lintel
the
soldiers
came
hurrying
down
the
street
with
bloody
hands
and
dripping
swords
at
the
sight
of
the
stranger
in
his
imposing
dress
they
hesitated
with
surprise
the
captain
of
the
band
approached
the
threshold
to
thrust
him
aside
but
artaban
did
not
stir
his
face
was
as
calm
as
though
he
were
watching
the
stars
and
in
his
eyes
there
burned
that
steady
radiance
before
which
even
the
hunting
leopard
shrinks
and
the
bloodhound
pauses
in
his
leap
he
held
the
soldier
silently
for
an
instant
and
then
said
in
a
low
voice
i
am
all
alone
in
this
place
and
i
am
waiting
to
give
this
jewel
to
the
prudent
captain
who
will
leave
me
in
he
showed
the
ruby
glistening
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
like
a
great
drop
of
blood
the
captain
was
amazed
at
the
splendour
of
the
gem
the
pupils
of
his
eyes
expanded
with
desire
and
the
hard
lines
of
greed
wrinkled
around
his
lips
he
stretched
out
his
hand
and
took
the
ruby
march
on
he
cried
to
his
men
there
is
no
child
here
the
house
is
the
clamor
and
the
clang
of
arms
passed
down
the
street
as
the
headlong
fury
of
the
chase
sweeps
by
the
secret
covert
where
the
trembling
deer
is
hidden
artaban
the
cottage
he
turned
his
face
to
the
east
and
prayed
god
of
truth
forgive
my
sin
i
have
said
the
thing
that
is
not
to
save
the
life
of
a
child
and
two
of
my
gifts
are
gone
i
have
spent
for
man
that
which
was
meant
for
god
shall
i
ever
be
worthy
to
see
the
face
of
the
king
but
the
voice
of
the
woman
weeping
for
joy
in
the
shadow
behind
him
said
very
gently
because
thou
hast
saved
the
life
of
my
little
one
may
the
lord
bless
thee
and
keep
thee
the
lord
make
his
face
to
shine
upon
thee
and
be
gracious
unto
thee
the
lord
lift
up
his
countenance
upon
thee
and
give
thee
iv
again
there
was
a
silence
in
the
hall
of
dreams
deeper
and
more
mysterious
than
the
first
interval
and
i
understood
that
the
years
of
artaban
were
flowing
very
swiftly
under
the
stillness
and
i
caught
only
a
glimpse
here
and
there
of
the
river
of
his
life
shining
through
the
mist
that
concealed
its
course
i
saw
him
moving
among
the
throngs
of
men
in
populous
egypt
seeking
everywhere
for
traces
of
the
household
that
had
come
down
from
bethlehem
and
finding
them
under
the
spreading
of
heliopolis
and
beneath
the
walls
of
the
roman
fortress
of
new
babylon
beside
the
nile
traces
so
faint
and
dim
that
they
vanished
before
him
continually
as
footprints
on
the
wet
glisten
for
a
moment
with
moisture
and
then
disappear
i
saw
him
again
at
the
foot
of
the
pyramids
which
lifted
their
sharp
points
into
the
intense
saffron
glow
of
the
sunset
sky
changeless
monuments
of
the
perishable
glory
and
the
imperishable
hope
of
man
he
looked
up
into
the
face
of
the
crouching
sphinx
and
vainly
tried
to
read
the
meaning
of
the
calm
eyes
and
smiling
mouth
was
it
indeed
the
mockery
of
all
effort
and
all
aspiration
as
tigranes
had
said
the
cruel
jest
of
a
riddle
that
has
no
answer
a
search
that
never
can
succeed
or
was
there
a
touch
of
pity
and
encouragement
in
that
inscrutable
smile
a
promise
that
even
the
defeated
should
attain
a
victory
and
the
disappointed
should
discover
a
prize
and
the
ignorant
should
be
made
wise
and
the
blind
should
see
and
the
wandering
should
come
into
the
haven
at
last
i
saw
him
again
in
an
obscure
house
of
alexandria
taking
counsel
with
a
hebrew
rabbi
the
venerable
man
bending
over
the
rolls
of
parchment
on
which
the
prophecies
of
israel
were
written
read
aloud
the
pathetic
words
which
foretold
the
sufferings
of
the
promised
messiah
the
despised
and
rejected
of
men
the
man
of
sorrows
and
acquainted
with
grief
and
remember
my
son
said
he
fixing
his
eyes
upon
the
face
of
artaban
the
king
whom
thou
seekest
is
not
to
be
found
in
a
palace
nor
among
the
rich
and
powerful
if
the
light
of
the
world
and
the
glory
of
israel
had
been
appointed
to
come
with
the
greatness
of
earthly
splendour
it
must
have
appeared
long
ago
for
no
son
of
abraham
will
ever
again
rival
the
power
which
joseph
had
in
the
palaces
of
egypt
or
the
magnificence
of
solomon
throned
between
the
lions
in
jerusalem
but
the
light
for
which
the
world
is
waiting
is
a
new
light
the
glory
that
shall
rise
out
of
patient
and
triumphant
suffering
and
the
kingdom
which
is
to
be
established
forever
is
a
new
kingdom
the
royalty
of
unconquerable
love
i
do
not
know
how
this
shall
come
to
pass
nor
how
the
turbulent
kings
and
peoples
of
earth
shall
be
brought
to
acknowledge
the
messiah
and
pay
homage
to
him
but
this
i
know
those
who
seek
him
will
do
well
to
look
among
the
poor
and
the
lowly
the
sorrowful
and
the
so
i
saw
the
other
wise
man
again
and
again
travelling
from
place
to
place
and
searching
among
the
people
of
the
dispersion
with
whom
the
little
family
from
bethlehem
might
perhaps
have
found
a
refuge
he
passed
through
countries
where
famine
lay
heavy
upon
the
land
and
the
poor
were
crying
for
bread
he
made
his
dwelling
in
cities
where
the
sick
were
languishing
in
the
bitter
companionship
of
helpless
misery
he
visited
the
oppressed
and
the
afflicted
in
the
gloom
of
subterranean
prisons
and
the
crowded
wretchedness
of
and
the
weary
toil
of
in
all
this
populous
and
intricate
world
of
anguish
though
he
found
none
to
worship
he
found
many
to
help
he
fed
the
hungry
and
clothed
the
naked
and
healed
the
sick
and
comforted
the
captive
and
his
years
passed
more
swiftly
than
the
weaver
s
shuttle
that
flashes
back
and
forth
through
the
loom
while
the
web
grows
and
the
pattern
is
completed
it
seemed
almost
as
if
he
had
forgotten
his
quest
but
once
i
saw
him
for
a
moment
as
he
stood
alone
at
sunrise
waiting
at
the
gate
of
a
roman
prison
he
had
taken
from
a
secret
in
his
bosom
the
pearl
the
last
of
his
jewels
as
he
looked
at
it
a
mellower
lustre
a
soft
and
iridescent
light
full
of
shifting
gleams
of
azure
and
rose
trembled
upon
its
surface
it
seemed
to
have
absorbed
some
reflection
of
the
lost
sapphire
and
ruby
so
the
secret
purpose
of
a
noble
life
draws
into
itself
the
memories
of
past
joy
and
past
sorrow
all
that
has
helped
it
all
that
has
hindered
it
is
transfused
by
a
subtle
magic
into
its
very
essence
it
becomes
more
luminous
and
precious
the
longer
it
is
carried
close
to
the
warmth
of
the
beating
heart
then
at
last
while
i
was
thinking
of
this
pearl
and
of
its
meaning
i
heard
the
end
of
the
story
of
the
other
wise
man
v
years
of
the
life
of
artaban
had
passed
away
and
he
was
still
a
pilgrim
and
a
seeker
after
light
his
hair
once
darker
than
the
cliffs
of
zagros
was
now
white
as
the
wintry
snow
that
covered
them
his
eyes
that
once
flashed
like
flames
of
fire
were
dull
as
embers
smouldering
among
the
ashes
worn
and
weary
and
ready
to
die
but
still
looking
for
the
king
he
had
come
for
the
last
time
to
jerusalem
he
had
often
visited
the
holy
city
before
and
had
searched
all
its
lanes
and
crowded
bevels
and
black
prisons
without
finding
any
trace
of
the
family
of
nazarenes
who
had
fled
from
bethlehem
long
ago
but
now
it
seemed
as
if
he
must
make
one
more
effort
and
something
whispered
in
his
heart
that
at
last
he
might
succeed
it
was
the
season
of
the
passover
the
city
was
thronged
with
strangers
the
children
of
israel
scattered
in
far
lands
had
returned
to
the
temple
for
the
great
feast
and
there
had
been
a
confusion
of
tongues
in
the
narrow
streets
for
many
days
but
on
this
day
a
singular
agitation
was
visible
in
the
multitude
the
sky
was
veiled
with
a
portentous
gloom
currents
of
excitement
seemed
to
flash
through
the
crowd
a
secret
tide
was
sweeping
them
all
one
way
the
clatter
of
sandals
and
the
soft
thick
sound
of
thousands
of
bare
feet
shuffling
over
the
stones
flowed
unceasingly
along
the
street
that
leads
to
the
damascus
gate
artaban
joined
a
group
of
people
from
his
own
country
parthian
jews
who
had
come
up
to
keep
the
passover
and
inquired
of
them
the
cause
of
the
tumult
and
where
they
were
going
we
are
going
they
answered
to
the
place
called
golgotha
outside
the
city
walls
where
there
is
to
be
an
execution
have
you
not
heard
what
has
happened
two
famous
robbers
are
to
be
crucified
and
with
them
another
called
jesus
of
nazareth
a
man
who
has
done
many
wonderful
works
among
the
people
so
that
they
love
him
greatly
but
the
priests
and
elders
have
said
that
he
must
die
because
he
gave
himself
out
to
be
the
son
of
god
and
pilate
has
sent
him
to
the
cross
because
he
said
that
he
was
the
king
of
the
how
strangely
these
familiar
words
fell
upon
the
tired
heart
of
artaban
they
had
led
him
for
a
lifetime
over
land
and
sea
and
now
they
came
to
him
mysteriously
like
a
message
of
despair
the
king
had
arisen
but
he
had
been
denied
and
cast
out
he
was
about
to
perish
perhaps
he
was
already
dying
could
it
be
the
same
who
had
been
born
in
bethlehem
years
ago
at
whose
birth
the
star
had
appeared
in
heaven
and
of
whose
coming
the
prophets
had
spoken
artaban
s
heart
beat
unsteadily
with
that
troubled
doubtful
apprehension
which
is
the
excitement
of
old
age
but
he
said
within
himself
the
ways
of
god
are
stranger
than
the
thoughts
of
men
and
it
may
be
that
i
shall
find
the
king
at
last
in
the
hands
of
his
enemies
and
shall
come
in
time
to
offer
my
pearl
for
his
ransom
before
he
so
the
old
man
followed
the
multitude
with
slow
and
painful
steps
toward
the
damascus
gate
of
the
city
just
beyond
the
entrance
of
the
guardhouse
a
troop
of
macedonian
soldiers
came
down
the
street
dragging
a
young
girl
with
torn
dress
and
dishevelled
hair
as
the
magian
paused
to
look
at
her
with
compassion
she
broke
suddenly
from
the
hands
of
her
tormentors
and
threw
herself
at
his
feet
clasping
him
around
the
knees
she
had
seen
his
white
cap
and
the
winged
circle
on
his
breast
have
pity
on
me
she
cried
and
save
me
for
the
sake
of
the
god
of
purity
i
also
am
a
daughter
of
the
true
religion
which
is
taught
by
the
magi
my
father
was
a
merchant
of
parthia
but
he
is
dead
and
i
am
seized
for
his
debts
to
be
sold
as
a
slave
save
me
from
worse
than
death
artaban
trembled
it
was
the
old
conflict
in
his
soul
which
had
come
to
him
in
the
of
babylon
and
in
the
cottage
at
bethlehem
the
conflict
between
the
expectation
of
faith
and
the
impulse
of
love
twice
the
gift
which
he
had
consecrated
to
the
worship
of
religion
had
been
drawn
to
the
service
of
humanity
this
was
the
third
trial
the
ultimate
probation
the
final
and
irrevocable
choice
was
it
his
great
opportunity
or
his
last
temptation
he
could
not
tell
one
thing
only
was
clear
in
the
darkness
of
his
mind
it
was
inevitable
and
does
not
the
inevitable
come
from
god
one
thing
only
was
sure
to
his
divided
heart
to
rescue
this
helpless
girl
would
be
a
true
deed
of
love
and
is
not
love
the
light
of
the
soul
he
took
the
pearl
from
his
bosom
never
had
it
seemed
so
luminous
so
radiant
so
full
of
tender
living
lustre
he
laid
it
in
the
hand
of
the
slave
this
is
thy
ransom
daughter
it
is
the
last
of
my
treasures
which
i
kept
for
the
while
he
spoke
the
darkness
of
the
sky
deepened
and
shuddering
tremors
ran
through
the
earth
heaving
convulsively
like
the
breast
of
one
who
struggles
with
mighty
grief
the
walls
of
the
houses
rocked
to
and
fro
stones
were
loosened
and
crashed
into
the
street
dust
clouds
filled
the
air
the
soldiers
fled
in
terror
reeling
like
drunken
men
but
artaban
and
the
girl
whom
he
had
ransomed
crouched
helpless
beneath
the
wall
of
the
praetorium
what
had
he
to
fear
what
had
he
to
hope
he
had
given
away
the
last
remnant
of
his
tribute
for
the
king
he
had
parted
with
the
last
hope
of
finding
him
the
quest
was
over
and
it
had
failed
but
even
in
that
thought
accepted
and
embraced
there
was
peace
it
was
not
resignation
it
was
not
submission
it
was
something
more
profound
and
searching
he
knew
that
all
was
well
because
he
had
done
the
best
that
he
could
from
day
to
day
he
had
been
true
to
the
light
that
had
been
given
to
him
he
had
looked
for
more
and
if
he
had
not
found
it
if
a
failure
was
all
that
came
out
of
his
life
doubtless
that
was
the
best
that
was
possible
he
had
not
seen
the
revelation
of
life
everlasting
incorruptible
and
but
he
knew
that
even
if
he
could
live
his
earthly
life
over
again
it
could
not
be
otherwise
than
it
had
been
one
more
lingering
pulsation
of
the
earthquake
quivered
through
the
ground
a
heavy
tile
shaken
from
the
roof
fell
and
struck
the
old
man
on
the
temple
he
lay
breathless
and
pale
with
his
gray
head
resting
on
the
young
girl
s
shoulder
and
the
blood
trickling
from
the
wound
as
she
bent
over
him
fearing
that
he
was
dead
there
came
a
voice
through
the
twilight
very
small
and
still
like
music
sounding
from
a
distance
in
which
the
notes
are
clear
but
the
words
are
lost
the
girl
turned
to
see
if
some
one
had
spoken
from
the
window
above
them
but
she
saw
no
one
then
the
old
man
s
lips
began
to
move
as
if
in
answer
and
she
heard
him
say
in
the
parthian
tongue
not
so
my
lord
for
when
saw
i
thee
an
hungered
and
fed
thee
or
thirsty
and
gave
thee
drink
when
saw
i
thee
a
stranger
and
took
thee
in
or
naked
and
clothed
thee
when
saw
i
thee
sick
or
in
prison
and
came
unto
thee
thirty
years
have
i
looked
for
thee
but
i
have
never
seen
thy
face
nor
ministered
to
thee
my
he
ceased
and
the
sweet
voice
came
again
and
again
the
maid
heard
it
very
faint
and
far
away
but
now
it
seemed
as
though
she
understood
the
words
verily
i
say
unto
thee
inasmuch
as
thou
hast
done
it
unto
one
of
the
least
of
these
my
brethren
thou
hast
done
it
unto
a
calm
radiance
of
wonder
and
joy
lighted
the
pale
face
of
artaban
like
the
first
ray
of
dawn
on
a
snowy
a
long
breath
of
relief
exhaled
gently
from
his
lips
his
journey
was
ended
his
treasures
were
accepted
the
other
wise
man
had
found
the
king
a
handful
of
clay
there
was
a
handful
of
clay
in
the
bank
of
a
river
it
was
only
common
clay
coarse
and
heavy
but
it
had
high
thoughts
of
its
own
value
and
wonderful
dreams
of
the
great
place
which
it
was
to
fill
in
the
world
when
the
time
came
for
its
virtues
to
be
discovered
overhead
in
the
spring
sunshine
the
trees
whispered
together
of
the
glory
which
descended
upon
them
when
the
delicate
blossoms
and
leaves
began
to
expand
and
the
forest
glowed
with
fair
clear
colours
as
if
the
dust
of
thousands
of
rubies
and
emeralds
were
hanging
in
soft
clouds
above
the
earth
the
flowers
surprised
with
the
joy
of
beauty
bent
their
heads
to
one
another
as
the
wind
caressed
them
and
said
sisters
how
lovely
you
have
become
you
make
the
day
the
river
glad
of
new
strength
and
rejoicing
in
the
unison
of
all
its
waters
murmured
to
the
shores
in
music
telling
of
its
release
from
icy
fetters
its
swift
flight
from
the
mountains
and
the
mighty
work
to
which
it
was
hurrying
the
wheels
of
many
mills
to
be
turned
and
great
ships
to
be
floated
to
the
sea
waiting
blindly
in
its
bed
the
clay
comforted
itself
with
lofty
hopes
my
time
will
come
it
said
i
was
not
made
to
be
hidden
forever
glory
and
beauty
and
honour
are
coming
to
me
in
due
one
day
the
clay
felt
itself
taken
from
the
place
where
it
had
waited
so
long
a
flat
blade
of
iron
passed
beneath
it
and
lifted
it
and
tossed
it
into
a
cart
with
other
lumps
of
clay
and
it
was
carried
far
away
as
it
seemed
over
a
rough
and
stony
road
but
it
was
not
afraid
nor
discouraged
for
it
said
to
itself
this
is
necessary
the
path
to
glory
is
always
rugged
now
i
am
on
my
way
to
play
a
great
part
in
the
but
the
hard
journey
was
nothing
compared
with
the
tribulation
and
distress
that
came
after
it
the
clay
was
put
into
a
trough
and
mixed
and
beaten
and
stirred
and
trampled
it
seemed
almost
unbearable
but
there
was
consolation
in
the
thought
that
something
very
fine
and
noble
was
certainly
coming
out
of
all
this
trouble
the
clay
felt
sure
that
if
it
could
only
wait
long
enough
a
wonderful
reward
was
in
store
for
it
then
it
was
put
upon
a
swiftly
turning
wheel
and
whirled
around
until
it
seemed
as
if
it
must
fly
into
a
thousand
pieces
a
strange
power
pressed
it
and
moulded
it
as
it
revolved
and
through
all
the
dizziness
and
pain
it
felt
that
it
was
taking
a
new
form
then
an
unknown
hand
put
it
into
an
oven
and
fires
were
kindled
about
it
fierce
and
penetrating
hotter
than
all
the
heats
of
summer
that
had
ever
brooded
upon
the
bank
of
the
river
but
through
all
the
clay
held
itself
together
and
endured
its
trials
in
the
confidence
of
a
great
future
surely
it
thought
i
am
intended
for
something
very
splendid
since
such
pains
are
taken
with
me
perhaps
i
am
fashioned
for
the
ornament
of
a
temple
or
a
precious
vase
for
the
table
of
a
at
last
the
baking
was
finished
the
clay
was
taken
from
the
furnace
and
set
down
upon
a
board
in
the
cool
air
under
the
blue
sky
the
tribulation
was
passed
the
reward
was
at
hand
close
beside
the
board
there
was
a
pool
of
water
not
very
deep
nor
very
clear
but
calm
enough
to
reflect
with
impartial
truth
every
image
that
fell
upon
it
there
for
the
first
time
as
it
was
lifted
from
the
board
the
clay
saw
its
new
shape
the
reward
of
all
its
patience
and
pain
the
consummation
of
its
hopes
a
common
straight
and
stiff
red
and
ugly
and
then
it
felt
that
it
was
not
destined
for
a
king
s
house
nor
for
a
palace
of
art
because
it
was
made
without
glory
or
beauty
or
honour
and
it
murmured
against
the
unknown
maker
saying
why
hast
thou
made
me
thus
many
days
it
passed
in
sullen
discontent
then
it
was
filled
with
earth
and
something
it
knew
not
what
but
something
rough
and
brown
and
was
thrust
into
the
middle
of
the
earth
and
covered
over
the
clay
rebelled
at
this
new
disgrace
this
is
the
worst
of
all
that
has
happened
to
me
to
be
filled
with
dirt
and
rubbish
surely
i
am
a
but
presently
it
was
set
in
a
greenhouse
where
the
sunlight
fell
warm
upon
it
and
water
was
sprinkled
over
it
and
day
by
day
as
it
waited
a
change
began
to
come
to
it
something
was
stirring
within
it
a
new
hope
still
it
was
ignorant
and
knew
not
what
the
new
hope
meant
one
day
the
clay
was
lifted
again
from
its
place
and
carried
into
a
great
church
its
dream
was
coming
true
after
all
it
had
a
fine
part
to
play
in
the
world
glorious
music
flowed
over
it
it
was
surrounded
with
flowers
still
it
could
not
understand
so
it
whispered
to
another
vessel
of
clay
like
itself
close
beside
it
why
have
they
set
me
here
why
do
all
the
people
look
toward
us
and
the
other
vessel
answered
do
you
not
know
you
are
carrying
a
royal
sceptre
of
lilies
their
petals
are
white
as
snow
and
the
heart
of
them
is
like
pure
gold
the
people
look
this
way
because
the
flower
is
the
most
wonderful
in
the
world
and
the
root
of
it
is
in
your
then
the
clay
was
content
and
silently
thanked
its
maker
because
though
an
earthen
vessel
it
held
so
great
a
treasure
the
lost
word
come
down
hermas
come
down
the
night
is
past
it
is
time
to
be
stirring
christ
is
born
today
peace
be
with
you
in
his
name
make
haste
and
come
down
a
little
group
of
young
men
were
standing
in
a
street
of
antioch
in
the
dusk
of
early
morning
fifteen
hundred
years
ago
a
class
of
candidates
who
had
nearly
finished
their
years
of
training
for
the
christian
church
they
had
come
to
call
their
hermas
from
his
lodging
their
voices
rang
out
cheerily
through
the
cool
air
they
were
full
of
that
glad
sense
of
life
which
the
young
feel
when
they
have
risen
early
and
come
to
rouse
one
who
is
still
sleeping
there
was
a
note
of
friendly
triumph
in
their
call
as
if
they
were
exulting
unconsciously
in
having
begun
the
adventure
of
the
new
day
before
their
comrade
but
hermas
was
not
asleep
he
had
been
waking
for
hours
and
the
walls
of
his
narrow
lodging
had
been
a
prison
to
his
heart
a
nameless
sorrow
and
discontent
had
fallen
upon
him
and
he
could
find
no
escape
from
the
heaviness
of
his
own
thoughts
there
is
a
sadness
of
youth
into
which
the
old
can
not
enter
it
seems
unreal
and
causeless
but
it
is
even
more
bitter
and
burdensome
than
the
sadness
of
age
there
is
a
sting
of
resentment
in
it
a
fever
of
angry
surprise
that
the
world
should
so
soon
be
a
disappointment
and
life
so
early
take
on
the
look
of
a
failure
it
has
little
reason
in
it
perhaps
but
it
has
all
the
more
weariness
and
gloom
because
the
man
who
is
oppressed
by
it
feels
dimly
that
it
is
an
unnatural
thing
that
he
should
be
tired
of
living
before
he
has
fairly
begun
to
live
hermas
had
fallen
into
the
very
depths
of
this
strange
he
was
out
of
tune
with
everything
around
him
he
had
been
thinking
through
the
dead
night
of
all
that
he
had
given
up
when
he
left
the
house
of
his
father
the
wealthy
pagan
demetrius
to
join
the
company
of
the
christians
only
two
years
ago
he
had
been
one
of
the
richest
young
men
in
antioch
now
he
was
one
of
the
poorest
the
worst
of
it
was
that
though
he
had
made
the
choice
willingly
and
with
a
kind
of
enthusiasm
he
was
already
dissatisfied
with
it
the
new
life
was
no
happier
than
the
old
he
was
weary
of
vigils
and
fasts
weary
of
studies
and
penances
weary
of
prayers
and
sermons
he
felt
like
a
slave
in
a
treadmill
he
knew
that
he
must
go
on
his
honour
his
conscience
his
sense
of
duty
bound
him
he
could
not
go
back
to
the
old
careless
pagan
life
again
for
something
had
happened
within
him
which
made
a
return
impossible
doubtless
he
had
found
the
true
religion
but
he
had
found
it
only
as
a
task
and
a
burden
its
joy
and
peace
had
slipped
away
from
him
he
felt
disillusioned
and
robbed
he
sat
beside
his
hard
couch
waiting
without
expectancy
for
the
gray
dawn
of
another
empty
day
and
hardly
lifting
his
head
at
the
shouts
of
his
friends
come
down
hermas
you
sluggard
come
down
it
is
christmas
morn
awake
and
be
glad
with
us
i
am
coming
he
answered
listlessly
only
have
patience
a
moment
i
have
been
awake
since
midnight
and
waiting
for
the
you
hear
him
said
his
friends
one
to
another
how
he
puts
us
all
to
shame
he
is
more
watchful
more
eager
than
any
of
us
our
master
john
the
presbyter
does
well
to
be
proud
of
him
he
is
the
best
man
in
our
while
they
were
talking
the
door
opened
and
hermas
stepped
out
he
was
a
figure
to
be
remarked
in
any
company
tall
with
a
head
proudly
poised
on
the
firm
column
of
the
neck
and
short
brown
curls
clustering
over
the
square
forehead
it
was
the
perpetual
type
of
vigorous
and
intelligent
young
manhood
such
as
may
be
found
in
every
century
among
the
throngs
of
ordinary
men
as
if
to
show
what
the
flower
of
the
race
should
be
but
the
light
in
his
eyes
was
clouded
and
uncertain
his
smooth
cheeks
were
leaner
than
they
should
have
been
at
twenty
and
there
were
downward
lines
about
his
mouth
which
spoke
of
desires
unsatisfied
and
ambitions
repressed
he
joined
his
companions
with
brief
greetings
a
nod
to
one
a
word
to
another
and
they
passed
together
down
the
steep
street
overhead
the
mystery
of
daybreak
was
silently
transfiguring
the
sky
the
curtain
of
darkness
had
lifted
along
the
edge
of
the
horizon
the
ragged
crests
of
mount
silpius
were
outlined
with
pale
saffron
light
in
the
central
vault
of
heaven
a
few
large
stars
twinkled
drowsily
the
great
city
still
chiefly
pagan
lay
more
than
but
multitudes
of
the
christians
dressed
in
white
and
carrying
lighted
torches
in
their
hands
were
hurrying
toward
the
basilica
of
constantine
to
keep
the
new
of
the
church
the
festival
of
the
birthday
of
their
master
the
vast
bare
building
was
soon
crowded
and
the
younger
converts
who
were
not
yet
permitted
to
stand
among
the
baptised
found
it
difficult
to
come
to
their
appointed
place
between
the
first
two
pillars
of
the
house
just
within
the
threshold
there
was
some
pressing
and
jostling
about
the
door
but
the
candidates
pushed
steadily
forward
by
your
leave
friends
our
station
is
beyond
you
will
you
let
us
pass
many
a
touch
here
a
courteous
nod
there
a
little
patience
a
little
persistence
and
at
last
they
stood
in
their
place
hermas
was
taller
than
his
companions
he
could
look
easily
over
their
heads
and
survey
the
sea
of
people
stretching
away
through
the
columns
under
the
shadows
of
the
high
roof
as
the
tide
spreads
on
a
calm
day
into
the
pillared
cavern
of
staffa
quiet
as
if
the
ocean
hardly
dared
to
breathe
the
light
of
many
flambeaux
fell
in
flickering
uncertain
rays
over
the
assembly
at
the
end
of
the
vista
there
was
a
circle
of
clearer
steadier
radiance
hermas
could
see
the
bishop
in
his
great
chair
surrounded
by
the
presbyters
the
lofty
desks
on
either
side
for
the
readers
of
the
scripture
the
and
the
table
of
offerings
in
the
middle
of
the
church
the
call
to
prayer
sounded
down
the
long
aisle
thousands
of
hands
were
joyously
lifted
in
the
air
as
if
the
sea
had
blossomed
into
waving
lilies
and
the
amen
was
like
the
murmur
of
countless
ripples
in
an
echoing
place
then
the
singing
began
led
by
the
choir
of
a
hundred
trained
voices
which
the
bishop
paul
had
founded
in
antioch
timidly
at
first
the
music
felt
its
way
as
the
people
joined
with
a
broken
and
uncertain
cadence
the
mingling
of
many
little
waves
not
yet
gathered
into
rhythm
and
harmony
soon
the
longer
stronger
billows
of
song
rolled
in
sweeping
from
side
to
side
as
the
men
and
the
women
answered
in
the
clear
antiphony
hermas
had
often
been
carried
on
those
tides
of
music
s
golden
sea
selling
toward
eternity
but
his
heart
was
a
rock
that
stood
motionless
the
flood
passed
by
and
left
him
unmoved
looking
out
from
his
place
at
the
foot
of
the
pillar
he
saw
a
man
standing
far
off
in
the
lofty
bema
short
and
slender
wasted
by
sickness
gray
before
his
time
with
pale
cheeks
and
wrinkled
brow
he
seemed
at
first
like
a
person
of
no
significance
a
reed
shaken
in
the
wind
but
there
was
a
look
in
his
poignant
eyes
as
he
gathered
all
the
glances
of
the
multitude
to
himself
that
belied
his
mean
appearance
and
prophesied
power
hermas
knew
very
well
who
it
was
the
man
who
had
drawn
him
from
his
father
s
house
the
teacher
who
was
instructing
him
as
a
son
in
the
christian
faith
the
guide
and
trainer
of
his
soul
john
of
antioch
whose
fame
filled
the
city
and
began
to
overflow
asia
and
who
was
called
already
chrysostom
the
preacher
hermas
had
felt
the
magic
of
his
eloquence
many
a
time
and
as
the
tense
voice
vibrated
through
the
stillness
and
the
sentences
moved
onward
growing
fuller
and
stronger
bearing
argosies
of
costly
rhetoric
and
treasures
of
homely
speech
in
their
bosom
and
drawing
the
hearts
of
men
with
a
resistless
magic
hermas
knew
that
the
preacher
had
never
been
more
potent
more
inspired
he
played
on
that
immense
congregation
as
a
master
on
an
instrument
he
rebuked
their
sins
and
they
trembled
he
touched
their
sorrows
and
they
wept
he
spoke
of
the
conflicts
the
triumphs
the
glories
of
their
faith
and
they
broke
out
in
thunders
of
applause
he
hushed
them
into
reverent
silence
and
led
them
tenderly
with
the
wise
men
of
the
east
to
the
lowly
birthplace
of
jesus
do
thou
therefore
likewise
leave
the
jewish
people
the
troubled
city
the
bloodthirsty
tyrant
the
pomp
of
the
world
and
hasten
to
bethlehem
the
sweet
house
of
spiritual
bread
for
though
thou
be
but
a
shepherd
and
come
hither
thou
shalt
behold
the
young
child
in
an
inn
though
thou
be
a
king
and
come
not
hither
thy
purple
robe
shall
profit
thee
nothing
though
thou
be
one
of
the
wise
men
this
shall
be
no
hindrance
to
thee
only
let
thy
coming
be
to
honour
and
adore
with
trembling
joy
the
son
of
god
to
whose
name
be
glory
on
this
his
birthday
and
forever
and
the
soul
of
hermas
did
not
answer
to
the
musician
s
touch
the
strings
of
his
heart
were
slack
and
soundless
there
was
no
response
within
him
he
was
neither
shepherd
nor
king
nor
wise
man
only
an
unhappy
dissatisfied
questioning
youth
he
was
out
of
sympathy
with
the
eager
preacher
the
joyous
hearers
in
their
harmony
he
had
no
part
was
it
for
this
that
he
had
forsaken
his
inheritance
and
narrowed
his
life
to
poverty
and
hardship
what
was
it
all
worth
the
gracious
prayers
with
which
the
young
converts
were
blessed
and
dismissed
before
the
sacrament
sounded
hollow
in
his
ears
never
had
he
felt
so
utterly
lonely
as
in
that
praying
throng
he
went
out
with
his
companions
like
a
man
departing
from
a
banquet
where
all
but
he
had
been
fed
farewell
hermas
they
cried
as
he
turned
from
them
at
the
door
but
he
did
not
look
back
nor
wave
his
hand
he
was
already
alone
in
his
heart
when
he
entered
the
broad
avenue
of
the
colonnades
the
sun
had
already
topped
the
eastern
hills
and
the
ruddy
light
was
streaming
through
the
long
double
row
of
archways
and
over
the
pavements
of
crimson
marble
but
hermas
turned
his
back
to
the
morning
and
walked
with
his
shadow
before
him
the
street
began
to
swarm
and
whirl
and
quiver
with
the
motley
life
of
a
huge
city
beggars
and
jugglers
dancers
and
musicians
gilded
youths
in
their
chariots
and
daughters
of
joy
looking
out
from
their
windows
all
intoxicated
with
the
mere
delight
of
living
and
the
gladness
of
a
new
day
the
pagan
populace
of
antioch
reckless
spendthrift
were
preparing
for
the
saturnalia
but
all
this
hermas
had
renounced
he
cleft
his
way
through
the
crowd
slowly
like
a
reluctant
swimmer
weary
of
breasting
the
tide
at
the
corner
of
the
street
where
the
narrow
populous
lane
of
the
crossed
the
colonnades
a
storyteller
had
bewitched
a
circle
of
people
around
him
it
was
the
same
old
tale
of
love
and
adventure
that
many
generations
have
listened
to
but
the
lively
fancy
of
the
hearers
rent
it
new
interest
and
the
wit
of
the
improviser
drew
forth
sighs
of
interest
and
shouts
of
laughter
a
girl
on
the
edge
of
the
throng
turned
as
hermas
passed
and
smiled
in
his
face
she
put
out
her
hand
and
caught
him
by
the
sleeve
stay
she
said
and
laugh
a
bit
with
us
i
know
who
you
are
the
son
of
demetrius
you
must
have
bags
of
gold
why
do
you
look
so
black
love
is
alive
hermas
shook
off
her
hand
but
not
ungently
i
don
t
know
what
you
mean
he
said
you
are
mistaken
in
me
i
am
poorer
than
you
but
as
he
passed
on
he
felt
the
warm
touch
of
her
fingers
through
the
cloth
on
his
arm
it
seemed
as
if
she
had
plucked
him
by
the
heart
he
went
out
by
the
western
gate
under
the
golden
cherubim
that
the
emperor
titus
had
stolen
from
the
ruined
temple
of
jerusalem
and
fixed
upon
the
arch
of
triumph
he
turned
to
the
left
and
climbed
the
hill
to
the
road
that
led
to
the
grove
of
daphne
in
all
the
world
there
was
no
other
highway
as
beautiful
it
wound
for
five
miles
along
the
foot
of
the
mountains
among
gardens
and
villas
plantations
of
myrtles
and
mulberries
with
wide
outlooks
over
the
valley
of
orontes
and
the
distant
shimmering
sea
the
richest
of
all
the
dwellings
was
the
house
of
the
golden
pillars
the
mansion
of
demetrius
he
had
won
the
favor
of
the
apostate
emperor
julian
whose
vain
efforts
to
restore
the
worship
of
the
heathen
gods
some
twenty
years
ago
had
opened
an
easy
way
to
wealth
and
power
for
all
who
would
mock
and
oppose
christianity
demetrius
was
not
a
sincere
fanatic
like
his
royal
master
but
he
was
bitter
enough
in
his
professed
scorn
of
the
new
religion
to
make
him
a
favourite
at
the
court
where
the
old
religion
was
in
fashion
he
had
reaped
a
rich
reward
of
his
policy
and
a
strange
sense
of
consistency
made
him
more
fiercely
loyal
to
it
than
if
it
had
been
a
real
faith
he
was
proud
of
being
called
the
friend
of
julian
and
when
his
son
joined
himself
to
the
christians
and
acknowledged
the
unseen
god
it
seemed
like
an
insult
to
his
father
s
success
he
drove
the
boy
from
his
door
and
disinherited
him
the
glittering
portico
of
the
serene
haughty
house
the
repose
of
the
garden
still
blooming
with
belated
flowers
seemed
at
once
to
deride
and
to
invite
the
young
outcast
plodding
along
the
dusty
road
this
is
your
birthright
whispered
the
clambering
by
the
gate
and
the
closed
portals
of
carven
bronze
said
you
have
sold
it
for
a
thought
a
ii
hermas
found
the
grove
of
daphne
quite
deserted
there
was
no
sound
in
the
enchanted
vale
but
the
rustling
of
the
light
winds
chasing
each
other
through
the
laurel
thickets
and
the
babble
of
innumerable
streams
memories
of
the
days
and
nights
of
delicate
pleasure
that
the
grove
had
often
seen
still
haunted
the
bewildered
paths
and
broken
fountains
at
the
foot
of
a
rocky
eminence
crowned
with
the
ruins
of
apollo
s
temple
which
had
been
mysteriously
destroyed
by
fire
just
after
julian
had
restored
and
reconsecrated
it
hermas
sat
down
beside
a
gushing
spring
and
gave
himself
up
to
sadness
how
beautiful
the
world
would
be
how
joyful
how
easy
to
live
in
without
religion
these
questions
about
unseen
things
perhaps
about
unreal
things
these
restraints
and
duties
and
i
were
only
free
from
them
all
and
could
only
forget
them
all
then
i
could
live
my
life
as
i
pleased
and
be
why
not
said
a
quiet
voice
at
his
back
he
turned
and
saw
an
old
man
with
a
long
beard
and
a
threadbare
cloak
the
garb
affected
by
the
pagan
philosophers
standing
behind
him
and
smiling
curiously
how
is
it
that
you
answer
that
which
has
not
been
spoken
said
hermas
and
who
are
you
that
honour
me
with
your
company
forgive
the
intrusion
answered
the
stranger
it
is
not
ill
meant
a
friendly
interest
is
as
good
as
an
but
to
what
singular
circumstance
do
i
owe
this
interest
to
your
face
said
the
old
man
with
a
courteous
inclination
perhaps
also
a
little
to
the
fact
that
i
am
the
oldest
inhabitant
here
and
feel
as
if
all
visitors
were
my
guests
in
a
are
you
then
one
of
the
keepers
of
the
grove
and
have
you
given
up
your
work
with
the
trees
to
take
a
holiday
as
a
philosopher
not
at
all
the
robe
of
philosophy
is
a
mere
affectation
i
must
confess
i
think
little
of
it
my
profession
is
the
care
of
altars
in
fact
i
am
the
solitary
priest
of
apollo
whom
the
emperor
julian
found
here
when
he
came
to
revive
the
worship
of
the
grove
some
twenty
years
ago
you
have
heard
of
the
incident
yes
said
hermas
beginning
to
be
interested
the
whole
city
must
have
heard
of
it
for
it
is
still
talked
of
but
surely
it
was
a
strange
sacrifice
that
you
brought
to
celebrate
the
restoration
of
apollo
s
temple
you
mean
the
ancient
goose
said
the
old
man
laughing
well
perhaps
it
was
not
precisely
what
the
emperor
expected
but
it
was
all
that
i
had
and
it
seemed
to
me
not
inappropriate
you
will
agree
to
that
if
you
are
a
christian
as
i
guess
from
your
you
speak
lightly
for
a
priest
of
oh
as
for
that
i
am
no
bigot
the
priesthood
is
a
professional
matter
and
the
name
of
apollo
is
as
good
as
any
other
how
many
altars
do
you
think
there
have
been
in
this
grove
i
do
not
just
including
that
of
the
martyr
babylas
whose
ruined
chapel
you
see
just
beyond
us
i
have
had
something
to
do
with
most
of
them
in
my
time
they
are
transitory
they
give
employment
to
for
a
while
but
the
thing
that
lasts
and
the
thing
that
interests
me
is
the
human
life
that
plays
around
them
the
game
has
been
going
on
for
centuries
it
still
disports
itself
very
pleasantly
on
summer
evenings
through
these
shady
walks
believe
me
for
i
know
daphne
and
apollo
are
shadows
but
the
flying
maidens
and
the
pursuing
lovers
the
music
and
the
dances
these
are
realities
life
is
a
game
and
the
world
keeps
it
up
merrily
but
you
you
are
of
a
sad
countenance
for
one
so
young
and
so
fair
are
you
a
loser
in
the
game
the
words
a
key
fits
the
lock
he
opened
his
heart
to
the
old
man
and
told
him
the
story
of
his
life
his
luxurious
boyhood
in
his
father
s
house
the
irresistible
spell
which
compelled
him
to
forsake
it
when
he
heard
john
s
preaching
of
the
new
religion
his
lonely
year
with
the
anchorites
among
the
mountains
the
strict
discipline
in
his
teacher
s
house
at
antioch
his
weariness
of
duty
his
distaste
for
poverty
his
discontent
with
worship
and
said
he
i
have
been
thinking
that
i
am
a
fool
my
life
is
swept
as
bare
as
a
hermit
s
cell
there
is
nothing
in
it
but
a
dream
a
thought
of
god
which
does
not
satisfy
the
singular
smile
deepened
on
his
companion
s
face
you
are
ready
then
he
suggested
to
renounce
your
new
religion
and
go
back
to
that
of
your
father
no
i
renounce
nothing
i
accept
nothing
i
do
not
wish
to
think
about
it
i
only
wish
to
a
very
reasonable
wish
and
i
think
you
are
about
to
see
its
accomplishment
indeed
i
may
even
say
that
i
can
put
you
in
the
way
of
securing
it
do
you
believe
in
magic
i
do
not
know
whether
i
believe
in
anything
this
is
not
a
day
on
which
i
care
to
make
professions
of
faith
i
believe
in
what
i
see
i
want
what
will
give
me
well
said
the
old
man
soothingly
as
he
plucked
a
leaf
from
the
above
them
and
dipped
it
in
the
spring
let
us
dismiss
the
riddles
of
belief
i
like
them
as
little
as
you
do
you
know
this
is
a
castalian
fountain
the
emperor
hadrian
once
read
his
fortune
here
from
a
leaf
dipped
in
the
water
let
us
see
what
this
leaf
tells
us
it
is
already
turning
yellow
how
do
you
read
that
wealth
said
hermas
laughing
as
he
looked
at
his
mean
garments
and
here
is
a
bud
on
the
stem
that
seems
to
be
swelling
what
is
that
pleasure
answered
hermas
bitterly
and
here
is
a
tracing
of
wreaths
upon
the
surface
what
do
you
make
of
that
what
you
will
said
hermas
not
even
taking
the
trouble
to
look
suppose
we
say
success
and
fame
yes
said
the
stranger
it
is
all
written
here
i
promise
that
you
shall
enjoy
it
all
but
you
do
not
need
to
believe
in
my
promise
i
am
not
in
the
habit
of
requiring
faith
of
those
whom
i
would
serve
no
such
hard
conditions
for
me
there
is
only
one
thing
that
i
ask
this
is
the
season
that
you
christians
call
the
christmas
and
you
have
taken
up
the
pagan
custom
of
exchanging
gifts
well
if
i
give
to
you
you
must
give
to
me
it
is
a
small
thing
and
really
the
thing
you
can
best
afford
to
part
with
a
single
word
the
name
of
him
you
profess
to
worship
let
me
take
that
word
and
all
that
belongs
to
it
entirely
out
of
your
life
so
that
you
shall
never
hear
it
or
speak
it
again
you
will
be
richer
without
it
i
promise
you
everything
and
this
is
all
i
ask
in
return
do
you
consent
yes
i
consent
said
hermas
mocking
if
you
can
take
your
price
a
word
you
can
keep
your
promise
a
the
stranger
laid
the
long
cool
wet
leaf
softly
across
the
young
man
s
eyes
an
icicle
of
pain
darted
through
them
every
nerve
in
his
body
was
drawn
together
there
in
a
knot
of
agony
then
all
the
tangle
of
pain
seemed
to
be
lifted
out
of
him
a
cool
languor
of
delight
flowed
back
through
every
vein
and
he
sank
into
a
profound
sleep
iii
there
is
a
slumber
so
deep
that
it
annihilates
time
it
is
like
a
fragment
of
eternity
beneath
its
enchantment
of
vacancy
a
day
seems
like
a
thousand
years
and
a
thousand
years
might
well
pass
as
one
day
it
was
such
a
sleep
that
fell
upon
hermas
in
the
grove
of
daphne
an
immeasurable
period
an
interval
of
life
so
blank
and
empty
that
he
could
not
tell
whether
it
was
long
or
short
had
passed
over
him
when
his
senses
began
to
stir
again
the
setting
sun
was
shooting
arrows
of
gold
under
the
glossy
he
rose
and
stretched
his
arms
grasping
a
smooth
branch
above
him
and
shaking
it
to
make
sure
that
he
was
alive
then
he
hurried
back
toward
antioch
treading
lightly
as
if
on
air
the
ground
seemed
to
spring
beneath
his
feet
already
his
life
had
changed
he
knew
not
how
something
that
did
not
belong
to
him
had
dropped
away
he
had
returned
to
a
former
state
of
being
he
felt
as
if
anything
might
happen
to
him
and
he
was
ready
for
anything
he
was
a
new
man
yet
curiously
familiar
to
himself
as
if
he
had
done
with
playing
a
tiresome
part
and
returned
to
his
natural
state
he
was
buoyant
and
free
without
a
care
a
doubt
a
fear
as
he
drew
near
to
his
father
s
house
he
saw
a
confusion
of
servants
in
the
porch
and
the
old
steward
ran
down
to
meet
him
at
the
gate
lord
we
have
been
seeking
you
everywhere
the
master
is
at
the
point
of
death
and
has
sent
for
you
since
the
sixth
hour
he
calls
your
name
continually
come
to
him
quickly
lord
for
i
fear
the
time
is
hermas
entered
the
house
at
once
nothing
could
amaze
him
his
father
lay
on
an
ivory
couch
in
the
inmost
chamber
with
shrunken
face
and
restless
eyes
his
lean
fingers
picking
incessantly
at
the
silken
coverlet
my
son
he
murmured
hermas
my
son
it
is
good
that
you
have
come
back
to
me
i
have
missed
you
i
was
wrong
to
send
you
away
you
shall
never
leave
me
again
you
are
my
son
my
heir
i
have
changed
everything
hermas
my
son
come
nearer
close
beside
me
take
my
hand
my
son
the
young
man
obeyed
and
kneeling
by
the
couch
gathered
his
father
s
cold
twitching
fingers
in
his
firm
warm
grasp
hermas
life
is
passing
long
rich
prosperous
the
last
sands
i
can
not
stay
them
my
religion
a
good
policy
julian
was
my
friend
but
now
he
is
gone
where
my
soul
is
empty
nothing
beyond
very
dark
i
am
afraid
but
you
know
something
better
you
found
something
that
made
you
willing
to
give
up
your
life
for
it
it
must
have
been
almost
like
dying
yet
you
were
happy
what
was
it
you
found
see
i
am
giving
you
everything
i
have
forgiven
you
now
forgive
me
tell
me
what
is
it
your
secret
your
faith
give
it
to
me
before
i
at
the
sound
of
this
broken
pleading
a
strange
passion
of
pity
and
love
took
the
young
man
by
the
throat
his
voice
shook
a
little
as
he
answered
eagerly
father
there
is
nothing
to
forgive
i
am
your
son
i
will
gladly
tell
you
all
that
i
know
i
will
give
you
the
secret
father
you
must
believe
with
all
your
heart
and
soul
and
strength
in
where
was
the
word
the
word
that
he
had
been
used
to
utter
night
and
morning
the
word
that
had
meant
to
him
more
than
he
had
ever
known
what
had
become
of
it
he
groped
for
it
in
the
dark
room
of
his
mind
he
had
thought
he
could
lay
his
hand
upon
it
in
a
moment
but
it
was
gone
some
one
had
taken
it
away
everything
else
was
most
clear
to
him
the
terror
of
death
the
lonely
soul
appealing
from
his
father
s
eyes
the
instant
need
of
comfort
and
help
but
at
the
one
point
where
he
looked
for
help
he
could
find
nothing
only
an
empty
space
the
word
of
hope
had
vanished
he
felt
for
it
blindly
and
in
desperate
haste
father
wait
i
have
forgotten
something
it
has
slipped
away
from
me
i
shall
find
it
in
a
moment
there
is
hope
i
will
tell
you
presently
oh
wait
the
bony
hand
gripped
his
like
a
vice
the
glazed
eyes
opened
wider
tell
me
whispered
the
old
man
tell
me
quickly
for
i
must
the
voice
sank
into
a
dull
rattle
the
fingers
closed
once
more
and
relaxed
the
light
behind
the
eyes
went
out
hermas
the
master
of
the
house
of
the
golden
pillars
was
keeping
watch
by
the
dead
iv
the
break
with
the
old
life
was
as
clean
as
if
it
had
been
cut
with
a
knife
some
faint
image
of
a
hermit
s
cell
a
bare
lodging
in
a
back
street
of
antioch
a
full
of
earnest
students
remained
in
hermas
memory
some
dull
echo
of
the
voice
of
john
the
presbyter
and
the
measured
sound
of
chanting
and
the
murmur
of
great
congregations
still
lingered
in
his
ears
but
it
was
like
something
that
had
happened
to
another
person
something
that
he
had
read
long
ago
but
of
which
he
had
lost
the
meaning
his
new
life
was
full
and
smooth
and
rich
too
rich
for
any
sense
of
loss
to
make
itself
felt
there
were
a
hundred
affairs
to
busy
him
and
the
days
ran
swiftly
by
as
if
they
were
shod
with
winged
sandals
nothing
needed
to
be
considered
prepared
for
begun
everything
was
ready
and
waiting
for
him
all
that
he
had
to
do
was
to
go
on
the
estate
of
demetrius
was
even
greater
than
the
world
had
supposed
there
were
fertile
lands
in
syria
which
the
emperor
had
given
him
in
phrygia
and
forests
of
valuable
timber
in
cilicia
the
vaults
of
the
villa
contained
chests
of
gold
and
silver
the
secret
cabinets
in
the
master
s
room
were
full
of
precious
stones
the
stewards
were
diligent
and
faithful
the
servants
of
the
household
rejoiced
at
the
young
master
s
return
his
table
was
spread
the
of
pleasure
was
woven
for
his
head
his
cup
was
overflowing
with
the
spicy
wine
of
power
the
period
of
mourning
for
his
father
came
at
a
fortunate
moment
to
seclude
and
safeguard
him
from
the
storm
of
political
troubles
and
persecutions
that
fell
upon
antioch
after
the
insults
offered
by
the
people
to
the
imperial
statues
in
the
year
the
friends
of
demetrius
prudent
and
conservative
persons
gathered
around
hermas
and
made
him
welcome
to
their
circle
chief
among
them
was
libanius
the
sophist
his
nearest
neighbour
whose
daughter
athenais
had
been
the
playmate
of
hermas
in
the
old
days
he
had
left
her
a
child
he
found
her
a
beautiful
woman
what
transformation
is
so
magical
so
charming
as
this
to
see
the
uncertain
lines
of
youth
rounded
into
firmness
and
symmetry
to
discover
the
merry
changing
face
of
the
girl
matured
into
perfect
loveliness
and
looking
at
you
with
calm
clear
serious
eyes
not
forgetting
the
past
but
fully
conscious
of
the
changed
present
this
is
to
behold
a
miracle
in
the
flesh
where
have
you
been
these
two
years
said
athenais
as
they
walked
together
through
the
garden
of
lilies
where
they
had
so
often
played
in
a
land
of
tiresome
dreams
answered
hermas
but
you
have
wakened
me
and
i
am
never
going
back
it
was
not
to
be
supposed
that
the
sudden
disappearance
of
hermas
from
among
his
former
associates
could
long
remain
unnoticed
at
first
it
was
a
mystery
there
was
a
fear
for
two
or
three
days
that
he
might
be
lost
some
of
his
more
intimate
companions
maintained
that
his
devotion
had
led
him
out
into
the
desert
to
join
the
anchorites
but
the
news
of
his
return
to
the
house
of
the
golden
pillars
and
of
his
new
life
as
its
master
filtered
quickly
through
the
gossip
of
the
city
then
the
church
was
filled
with
dismay
and
grief
and
reproach
messengers
and
letters
were
sent
to
hermas
they
disturbed
him
a
little
but
they
took
no
hold
upon
him
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
the
messengers
spoke
in
a
strange
language
as
he
read
the
letters
there
were
words
blotted
out
of
the
writing
which
made
the
full
sense
unintelligible
his
old
companions
came
to
reprove
him
for
leaving
them
to
warn
him
of
the
peril
of
apostasy
to
entreat
him
to
return
it
all
sounded
vague
and
futile
they
spoke
as
if
he
had
betrayed
or
offended
some
one
but
when
they
came
to
name
the
object
of
his
fear
the
one
whom
he
had
displeased
and
to
whom
he
should
return
he
heard
nothing
there
was
a
blur
of
silence
in
their
speech
the
clock
pointed
to
the
hour
but
the
bell
did
not
strike
at
last
hermas
refused
to
see
them
any
more
one
day
john
the
presbyter
stood
in
the
atrium
hermas
was
entertaining
libanius
and
athenais
in
the
when
the
visit
of
the
presbyter
was
announced
the
young
master
loosed
a
collar
of
gold
and
jewels
from
his
neck
and
gave
it
to
his
scribe
take
this
to
john
of
antioch
and
tell
him
it
is
a
gift
from
his
former
pupil
as
a
token
of
remembrance
or
to
spend
for
the
poor
of
the
city
i
will
always
send
him
what
he
wants
but
it
is
idle
for
us
to
talk
together
any
more
i
do
not
understand
what
he
says
i
have
not
gone
to
the
temple
nor
offered
sacrifice
nor
denied
his
teaching
i
have
simply
forgotten
i
do
not
think
about
those
things
any
longer
i
am
only
living
a
happy
man
wishes
him
all
happiness
and
but
john
let
the
golden
collar
fall
on
the
marble
floor
tell
your
master
that
we
shall
talk
together
again
in
due
time
said
he
as
he
passed
sadly
out
of
the
hall
the
love
of
athenais
and
hermas
was
like
a
tiny
rivulet
that
sinks
out
of
sight
in
a
cavern
but
emerges
again
a
bright
and
brimming
stream
the
careless
comradery
of
childhood
was
mysteriously
changed
into
a
complete
companionship
when
athenais
entered
the
house
of
the
golden
pillars
as
a
bride
all
the
music
of
life
came
with
her
hermas
called
the
feast
of
her
welcome
the
banquet
of
the
full
day
after
day
night
after
night
week
after
week
month
after
month
the
bliss
of
the
home
unfolded
like
a
rose
of
a
thousand
leaves
when
a
child
came
to
them
a
strong
beautiful
boy
worthy
to
be
the
heir
of
such
a
house
the
heart
of
the
rose
was
filled
with
overflowing
fragrance
happiness
was
heaped
upon
happiness
every
wish
brought
its
own
accomplishment
wealth
honour
beauty
peace
love
it
was
an
abundance
of
felicity
so
great
that
the
soul
of
hermas
could
hardly
contain
it
strangely
enough
it
began
to
press
upon
him
to
trouble
him
with
the
very
excess
of
joy
he
felt
as
if
there
were
something
yet
needed
to
complete
and
secure
it
all
there
was
an
urgency
within
him
a
longing
to
find
some
outlet
for
his
feelings
he
knew
not
how
some
expression
and
culmination
of
his
happiness
he
knew
not
what
under
his
joyous
demeanour
a
secret
fire
of
restlessness
began
to
burn
an
expectancy
of
something
yet
to
come
which
should
put
the
touch
of
perfection
on
his
life
he
spoke
of
it
to
athenais
as
they
sat
together
one
summer
evening
in
a
bower
of
jasmine
with
their
boy
playing
at
their
feet
there
had
been
music
in
the
garden
but
now
the
singers
and
had
withdrawn
leaving
the
master
and
mistress
alone
in
the
lingering
twilight
tremulous
with
inarticulate
melody
of
unseen
birds
there
was
a
secret
voice
in
the
hour
seeking
vainly
for
utterance
a
word
waiting
to
be
spoken
how
deep
is
our
happiness
my
beloved
said
hermas
deeper
than
the
sea
that
slumbers
yonder
below
the
city
and
yet
it
is
not
quite
full
and
perfect
there
is
a
depth
of
joy
that
we
have
not
yet
known
a
repose
of
happiness
that
is
still
beyond
us
what
is
it
i
have
no
superstitions
like
the
king
who
cast
his
into
the
sea
because
he
dreaded
that
some
secret
vengeance
would
fall
on
his
unbroken
good
fortune
that
was
an
idle
terror
but
there
is
something
that
oppresses
me
like
an
invisible
burden
there
is
something
still
undone
unspoken
unfelt
something
that
we
need
to
complete
everything
have
you
not
felt
it
too
can
you
not
lead
me
to
it
yes
she
answered
lifting
her
eyes
to
his
face
i
too
have
felt
it
hermas
this
burden
this
need
this
unsatisfied
longing
i
think
i
know
what
it
means
it
is
gratitude
the
language
of
the
heart
the
music
of
happiness
there
is
no
perfect
joy
without
gratitude
but
we
have
never
learned
it
and
the
want
of
it
troubles
us
it
is
like
being
dumb
with
a
heart
full
of
love
we
must
find
the
word
for
it
and
say
it
together
then
we
shall
be
perfectly
joined
in
perfect
joy
come
my
dear
lord
let
us
take
the
boy
with
us
and
give
hermas
lifted
the
child
in
his
arms
and
turned
with
athenais
into
the
depth
of
the
garden
there
was
a
dismantled
shrine
of
some
forgotten
fashion
of
worship
among
the
luxuriant
flowers
a
fallen
image
lay
beside
it
face
downward
in
the
grass
they
stood
there
hand
in
hand
the
boy
drowsily
resting
on
his
father
s
shoulder
silently
the
roseate
light
caressed
the
tall
spires
of
the
silently
the
shadows
gathered
at
their
feet
silently
the
tranquil
stars
looked
out
from
the
deepening
arch
of
heaven
the
very
breath
of
being
paused
it
was
the
hour
of
culmination
the
supreme
moment
of
felicity
waiting
for
its
crown
the
tones
of
hermas
were
clear
and
low
as
he
began
and
in
the
rhythm
of
an
ancient
song
fair
is
the
world
the
sea
the
sky
the
double
kingdom
of
day
and
night
in
the
glow
of
morning
in
the
shadow
of
evening
and
under
the
dripping
light
of
stars
fairer
still
is
life
in
our
breasts
with
its
manifold
music
and
meaning
with
its
wonder
of
seeing
and
hearing
and
feeling
and
knowing
and
being
fairer
and
still
more
fair
is
love
that
draws
us
together
mingles
our
lives
in
its
flow
and
bears
them
along
like
a
river
strong
and
clear
and
swift
reflecting
the
stars
in
its
bosom
wide
is
our
world
we
are
rich
we
have
all
things
life
is
abundant
within
us
a
measureless
deep
deepest
of
all
is
our
love
and
it
longs
to
speak
come
thou
final
word
come
thou
crown
of
speech
come
thou
charm
of
peace
open
the
gates
of
our
hearts
lift
the
weight
of
our
joy
and
bear
it
upward
for
all
good
gifts
for
all
perfect
gifts
for
love
for
life
for
the
world
we
praise
we
bless
we
thank
as
a
soaring
bird
struck
by
an
arrow
falls
headlong
from
the
sky
so
the
song
of
hermas
fell
at
the
end
of
his
flight
of
gratitude
there
was
nothing
a
blank
a
hollow
space
he
looked
for
a
face
and
saw
a
void
he
sought
for
a
hand
and
clasped
vacancy
his
heart
was
throbbing
and
swelling
with
passion
the
bell
swung
to
and
fro
within
him
beating
from
side
to
side
as
if
it
would
burst
but
not
a
single
note
came
from
it
all
the
fulness
of
his
feeling
that
had
risen
upward
like
a
fountain
fell
back
from
the
empty
sky
as
cold
as
snow
as
hard
as
hail
frozen
and
dead
there
was
no
meaning
in
his
happiness
no
one
had
sent
it
to
him
there
was
no
one
to
thank
for
it
his
felicity
was
a
closed
circle
a
wall
of
ice
let
us
go
back
he
said
sadly
to
athenais
the
child
is
heavy
upon
my
shoulder
we
will
lay
him
to
sleep
and
go
into
the
library
the
air
grows
chilly
we
were
mistaken
the
gratitude
of
life
is
only
a
dream
there
is
no
one
to
and
in
the
garden
it
was
already
night
v
no
outward
change
came
to
the
house
of
the
golden
pillars
everything
moved
as
smoothly
as
delicately
as
prosperously
as
before
but
inwardly
there
was
a
subtle
inexplicable
transformation
a
vague
discontent
a
final
and
inevitable
sense
of
incompleteness
overshadowed
existence
from
that
night
when
hermas
realised
that
his
joy
could
never
go
beyond
itself
the
next
morning
the
old
man
whom
he
had
seen
in
the
grove
of
daphne
but
never
since
appeared
mysteriously
at
the
door
of
the
house
as
if
he
had
been
sent
for
and
entered
like
an
invited
guest
hermas
could
not
but
make
him
welcome
and
at
first
he
tried
to
regard
him
with
reverence
and
affection
as
the
one
through
whom
fortune
had
come
but
it
was
impossible
there
was
a
chill
in
the
inscrutable
smile
of
marcion
as
he
called
himself
that
seemed
to
mock
at
reverence
he
was
in
the
house
as
one
watching
a
strange
experiment
tranquil
interested
ready
to
supply
anything
that
might
be
needed
for
its
completion
but
thoroughly
indifferent
to
the
feelings
of
the
subject
an
anatomist
of
life
looking
curiously
to
see
how
long
it
would
continue
and
how
it
would
act
after
the
heart
had
been
removed
in
his
presence
hermas
was
conscious
of
a
certain
irritation
a
resentful
anger
against
the
calm
frigid
scrutiny
of
the
eyes
that
followed
him
everywhere
like
a
pair
of
spies
peering
out
over
the
smiling
mouth
and
the
long
white
beard
why
do
you
look
at
me
so
curiously
asked
hermas
one
morning
as
they
sat
together
in
the
library
do
you
see
anything
strange
in
me
no
answered
marcion
something
and
what
is
that
a
singular
likeness
to
a
discontented
young
man
that
i
met
some
years
ago
in
the
grove
of
but
why
should
that
interest
you
surely
it
was
to
be
a
thing
that
we
expect
often
surprises
us
when
we
see
it
besides
my
curiosity
is
piqued
i
suspect
you
of
keeping
a
secret
from
you
are
jesting
with
me
there
is
nothing
in
my
life
that
you
do
not
know
what
is
the
secret
nothing
more
than
the
wish
to
have
one
you
are
growing
tired
of
your
bargain
the
play
wearies
you
that
is
foolish
do
you
want
to
try
a
new
part
the
question
was
like
a
mirror
upon
which
one
comes
suddenly
in
a
room
a
quick
illumination
falls
on
it
and
the
is
startled
by
the
look
of
his
own
face
you
are
right
said
hermas
i
am
tired
we
have
been
going
on
stupidly
in
this
house
as
if
nothing
were
possible
but
what
my
father
had
done
before
me
there
is
nothing
original
in
being
rich
and
and
thousands
of
men
have
tried
it
and
have
not
been
satisfied
let
us
do
something
new
let
us
make
a
mark
in
the
it
is
well
said
nodded
the
old
man
you
are
speaking
again
like
a
man
after
my
own
heart
there
is
no
folly
but
the
loss
of
an
opportunity
to
enjoy
a
new
from
that
day
hermas
seemed
to
be
possessed
with
a
perpetual
haste
an
uneasiness
that
left
him
no
repose
the
summit
of
life
had
been
attained
the
highest
possible
point
of
felicity
henceforward
the
course
could
only
be
at
a
level
perhaps
downward
it
might
be
brief
at
the
best
it
could
not
be
very
long
it
was
madness
to
lose
a
day
an
hour
that
would
be
the
only
fatal
mistake
to
forfeit
anything
of
the
bargain
that
he
had
made
he
would
have
it
and
hold
it
and
enjoy
it
all
to
the
full
the
world
might
have
nothing
better
to
give
than
it
had
already
given
but
surely
it
had
many
things
that
were
new
and
marcion
should
help
him
to
find
them
under
his
learned
counsel
the
house
of
the
golden
pillars
took
on
a
new
magnificence
artists
were
brought
from
corinth
and
rome
and
alexandria
to
adorn
it
with
splendour
its
fame
glittered
around
the
world
banquets
of
incredible
luxury
drew
the
most
celebrated
guests
into
its
triclinium
and
filled
them
with
envious
admiration
the
bees
swarmed
and
buzzed
about
the
golden
hive
the
human
insects
gorgeous
moths
of
pleasure
and
greedy
flies
of
appetite
parasites
and
flatterers
and
crowds
of
inquisitive
idlers
danced
and
fluttered
in
the
dazzling
light
that
surrounded
hermas
everything
that
he
touched
prospered
he
bought
a
tract
of
land
in
the
caucasus
and
emeralds
were
discovered
among
the
mountains
he
sent
a
fleet
of
to
italy
and
the
price
of
grain
doubled
while
it
was
on
the
way
he
sought
political
favour
with
the
emperor
and
was
rewarded
with
the
governorship
of
the
city
his
name
was
a
word
to
conjure
with
the
beauty
of
athenais
lost
nothing
with
the
passing
seasons
but
grew
more
perfect
even
under
the
inexplicable
shade
of
dissatisfaction
that
sometimes
veiled
it
fair
as
the
wife
of
hermas
was
a
proverb
in
antioch
and
soon
men
began
to
add
to
it
beautiful
as
the
son
of
hermas
for
the
child
developed
swiftly
in
that
favouring
clime
at
nine
years
of
age
he
was
straight
and
strong
firm
of
limb
and
clear
of
eye
his
brown
head
was
on
a
level
with
his
father
s
heart
he
was
the
jewel
of
the
house
of
the
golden
pillars
the
pride
of
hermas
the
new
fortunatus
that
year
another
drop
of
success
fell
into
his
brimming
cup
his
black
numidian
horses
which
he
had
been
training
for
the
of
antioch
won
the
victory
over
a
score
of
rivals
hermas
received
the
prize
carelessly
from
the
judge
s
hands
and
turned
to
drive
once
more
around
the
circus
to
show
himself
to
the
people
he
lifted
the
eager
boy
into
the
chariot
beside
him
to
share
his
triumph
here
indeed
was
the
glory
of
his
life
this
matchless
son
his
brighter
counterpart
carved
in
breathing
ivory
touching
his
arm
and
balancing
himself
proudly
on
the
swaying
floor
of
the
chariot
as
the
horses
pranced
around
the
ring
a
great
shout
of
applause
filled
the
amphitheatre
and
thousands
of
spectators
waved
their
salutations
of
praise
hail
fortunate
hermas
master
of
success
hail
little
hermas
prince
of
good
luck
the
sudden
tempest
of
acclamation
the
swift
fluttering
of
innumerable
garments
in
the
air
startled
the
horses
they
dashed
violently
forward
and
plunged
upon
the
bits
the
left
rein
broke
they
swerved
to
the
right
swinging
the
chariot
sideways
with
a
grating
noise
and
dashing
it
against
the
stone
parapet
of
the
arena
in
an
instant
the
wheel
was
shattered
the
axle
struck
the
ground
and
the
chariot
was
dragged
onward
rocking
and
staggering
by
a
strenuous
effort
hermas
kept
his
place
on
the
frail
platform
clinging
to
the
unbroken
rein
but
the
boy
was
tossed
lightly
from
his
side
at
the
first
shock
his
head
struck
the
wall
and
when
hermas
turned
to
look
for
him
he
was
lying
like
a
broken
flower
on
the
sand
vi
they
carried
the
boy
in
a
litter
to
the
house
of
the
golden
pillars
summoning
the
most
skilful
physician
of
antioch
to
attend
him
for
hours
the
child
was
as
quiet
as
death
hermas
watched
the
white
eyelids
folded
close
like
at
night
even
as
one
watches
for
the
morning
at
last
they
opened
but
the
fire
of
fever
was
burning
in
the
eyes
and
the
lips
were
moving
in
a
wild
delirium
hour
after
hour
that
sweet
childish
voice
rang
through
the
halls
and
chambers
of
the
splendid
helpless
house
now
rising
in
shrill
calls
of
distress
and
senseless
laughter
now
sinking
in
weariness
and
dull
moaning
the
stars
shone
and
faded
the
sun
rose
and
set
the
roses
bloomed
and
fell
in
the
garden
the
birds
sang
and
slept
among
the
but
in
the
heart
of
hermas
there
was
no
song
no
bloom
no
light
only
speechless
anguish
and
a
certain
fearful
of
desolation
he
was
like
a
man
in
a
nightmare
he
saw
the
shapeless
terror
that
was
moving
toward
him
but
he
was
impotent
to
stay
or
to
escape
it
he
had
done
all
that
he
could
there
was
nothing
left
but
to
wait
he
paced
to
and
fro
now
hurrying
to
the
boy
s
bed
as
if
he
could
not
bear
to
be
away
from
it
now
turning
back
as
if
he
could
not
endure
to
be
near
it
the
people
of
the
house
even
athenais
feared
to
speak
to
him
there
was
something
so
vacant
and
desperate
in
his
face
at
nightfall
on
the
second
of
those
eternal
days
he
shut
himself
in
the
library
the
unfilled
lamp
had
gone
out
leaving
a
trail
of
smoke
in
the
air
the
sprigs
of
mignonette
and
rosemary
with
which
the
room
was
sprinkled
every
day
were
unrenewed
and
scented
the
gloom
with
close
odours
of
decay
a
costly
manuscript
of
theocritus
was
tumbled
in
disorder
on
the
floor
hermas
sank
into
a
chair
like
a
man
in
whom
the
very
spring
of
being
is
broken
through
the
darkness
some
one
drew
near
he
did
not
even
lift
his
head
a
hand
touched
him
a
soft
arm
was
laid
over
his
shoulders
it
was
athenais
kneeling
beside
him
and
speaking
very
low
hermas
it
is
almost
over
the
child
his
voice
grows
weaker
hour
by
hour
he
moans
and
calls
for
some
one
to
help
him
then
he
laughs
it
breaks
my
heart
he
has
just
fallen
asleep
the
moon
is
rising
now
unless
a
change
comes
he
can
not
last
till
sunrise
is
there
nothing
we
can
do
is
there
no
power
that
can
save
him
is
there
no
one
to
pity
us
and
spare
us
let
us
call
let
us
beg
for
compassion
and
help
let
us
pray
for
his
life
yes
this
was
what
he
wanted
this
was
the
only
thing
that
could
bring
relief
to
pray
to
pour
out
his
sorrow
somewhere
to
find
a
greater
strength
than
his
own
and
cling
to
it
and
plead
for
mercy
and
help
to
leave
this
undone
was
to
be
false
to
his
manhood
it
was
to
be
no
better
than
the
dumb
beasts
when
their
young
perish
how
could
he
let
his
boy
suffer
and
die
without
an
effort
a
cry
a
prayer
he
sank
on
his
knees
beside
athenais
out
of
the
depths
out
of
the
depths
we
call
for
pity
the
light
of
our
eyes
is
fading
the
child
is
dying
oh
the
child
the
child
spare
the
child
s
life
thou
merciful
not
a
word
only
that
deathly
blank
the
hands
of
hermas
stretched
out
in
supplication
touched
the
marble
table
he
felt
the
cool
hardness
of
the
polished
stone
beneath
his
fingers
a
roll
of
papyrus
dislodged
by
his
touch
fell
rustling
to
the
floor
through
the
open
door
faint
and
far
off
came
the
footsteps
of
the
servants
moving
cautiously
the
heart
of
hermas
was
like
a
lump
of
ice
in
his
bosom
he
rose
slowly
to
his
feet
lifting
athenais
with
him
it
is
in
vain
he
said
there
is
nothing
for
us
to
do
long
ago
i
knew
something
i
think
it
would
have
helped
us
but
i
have
forgotten
it
it
is
all
gone
but
i
would
give
all
that
i
have
if
i
could
bring
it
back
again
now
at
this
hour
in
this
time
of
our
bitter
a
slave
entered
the
room
while
he
was
speaking
and
approached
hesitatingly
master
he
said
john
of
antioch
whom
we
were
forbidden
to
admit
to
the
house
has
come
again
he
would
take
no
denial
even
now
he
waits
in
the
peristyle
and
the
old
man
marcion
is
with
him
seeking
to
turn
him
come
said
hermas
to
his
wife
let
us
go
to
in
the
central
hall
the
two
men
were
standing
marcion
with
disdainful
eyes
and
sneering
lips
taunting
the
unbidden
guest
john
silent
quiet
patient
while
the
wondering
slaves
looked
on
in
dismay
he
lifted
his
searching
gaze
to
the
haggard
face
of
hermas
my
son
i
knew
that
i
should
see
you
again
even
though
you
did
not
send
for
me
i
have
come
to
you
because
i
have
heard
that
you
are
in
it
is
true
answered
hermas
passionately
we
are
in
trouble
desperate
trouble
trouble
accursed
our
child
is
dying
we
are
poor
we
are
destitute
we
are
afflicted
in
all
this
house
in
all
the
world
there
is
no
one
that
can
help
us
i
knew
something
long
ago
when
i
was
with
you
a
word
a
name
in
which
we
might
have
found
hope
but
i
have
lost
it
i
gave
it
to
this
man
he
has
taken
it
away
from
me
he
pointed
to
marcion
the
old
man
s
lips
curled
scornfully
a
word
a
name
he
sneered
what
is
that
o
most
wise
man
and
holy
presbyter
a
thing
of
air
a
thing
that
men
make
to
describe
their
own
dreams
and
fancies
who
would
go
about
to
rob
any
one
of
such
a
thing
as
that
it
is
a
prize
that
only
a
fool
would
think
of
taking
besides
the
young
man
parted
with
it
of
his
own
free
will
he
bargained
with
me
cleverly
i
promised
him
wealth
and
pleasure
and
fame
what
did
he
give
in
return
an
empty
name
which
was
a
burden
servant
of
demons
be
still
the
voice
of
john
rang
clear
like
a
trumpet
through
the
hall
there
is
a
name
which
none
shall
dare
to
take
in
vain
there
is
a
name
which
none
can
lose
without
being
lost
there
is
a
name
at
which
the
devils
tremble
go
quickly
before
i
speak
it
marcion
shrank
into
the
shadow
of
one
of
the
pillars
a
lamp
near
him
tottered
on
its
pedestal
and
fell
with
a
crash
in
the
confusion
he
vanished
as
noiselessly
as
a
shade
john
turned
to
hermas
and
his
tone
softened
as
he
said
my
son
you
have
sinned
deeper
than
you
know
the
word
with
which
you
parted
so
lightly
is
the
keyword
of
all
life
without
it
the
world
has
no
meaning
existence
no
peace
death
no
refuge
it
is
the
word
that
purifies
love
and
comforts
grief
and
keeps
hope
alive
forever
it
is
the
most
precious
word
that
ever
ear
has
heard
or
mind
has
known
or
heart
has
conceived
it
is
the
name
of
him
who
has
given
us
life
and
breath
and
all
things
richly
to
enjoy
the
name
of
him
who
though
we
may
forget
him
never
forgets
us
the
name
of
him
who
pities
us
as
you
pity
your
suffering
child
the
name
of
him
who
though
we
wander
far
from
him
seeks
us
in
the
wilderness
and
sent
his
son
even
as
his
son
has
sent
me
this
night
to
breathe
again
that
forgotten
name
in
the
heart
that
is
perishing
without
it
listen
my
son
listen
with
all
your
soul
to
the
blessed
name
of
god
our
the
cold
agony
in
the
breast
of
hermas
dissolved
like
a
fragment
of
ice
that
melts
in
the
summer
sea
a
sense
of
sweet
release
spread
through
him
from
head
to
foot
the
lost
was
found
the
dew
of
peace
fell
on
his
parched
soul
and
the
withering
flower
of
human
love
raised
its
head
again
he
stood
upright
and
lifted
his
hands
high
toward
heaven
out
of
the
depths
have
i
cried
unto
thee
o
lord
o
my
god
be
merciful
to
me
for
my
soul
trusteth
in
thee
my
god
thou
hast
given
take
not
thy
gift
away
from
me
o
my
god
spare
the
life
of
this
my
child
o
thou
god
my
father
my
father
a
deep
hush
followed
the
cry
listen
whispered
athenais
breathlessly
was
it
an
echo
it
could
not
be
for
it
came
again
the
voice
of
the
child
clear
and
low
waking
from
sleep
and
calling
father
the
first
i
the
day
before
christmas
in
the
year
of
our
lord
broad
glistening
white
along
the
banks
of
the
river
moselle
steep
blooming
with
mystic
where
the
glow
of
the
setting
sun
cast
long
shadows
down
their
eastern
slope
an
arch
of
clearest
deepest
gentian
bending
overhead
in
the
centre
of
the
aerial
garden
the
walls
of
the
cloister
of
pfalzel
to
the
east
violet
to
the
west
silence
over
all
a
gentle
eager
conscious
stillness
diffused
through
the
air
as
if
earth
and
sky
were
hushing
themselves
to
hear
the
voice
of
the
river
faintly
murmuring
down
the
valley
in
the
cloister
too
there
was
silence
at
the
sunset
hour
all
day
long
there
had
been
a
strange
and
joyful
stir
among
the
nuns
a
breeze
of
curiosity
and
excitement
had
swept
along
the
corridors
and
through
every
quiet
cell
a
famous
visitor
had
come
to
the
convent
it
was
winfried
of
england
whose
name
in
the
roman
tongue
was
boniface
and
whom
men
called
the
apostle
of
germany
a
great
preacher
a
wonderful
scholar
but
more
than
all
a
daring
traveller
a
venturesome
pilgrim
a
priest
of
romance
he
had
left
his
home
and
his
fair
estate
in
wessex
he
would
not
stay
in
the
rich
monastery
of
nutescelle
even
though
they
had
chosen
him
as
the
abbot
he
had
refused
a
bishopric
at
the
court
of
king
karl
nothing
would
content
him
but
to
go
out
into
the
wild
woods
and
preach
to
the
heathen
through
the
forests
of
hesse
and
thuringia
and
along
the
borders
of
saxony
he
had
wandered
for
years
with
a
handful
of
companions
sleeping
under
the
trees
crossing
mountains
and
marshes
now
here
now
there
never
satisfied
with
ease
and
comfort
always
in
love
with
hardship
and
danger
what
a
man
he
was
fair
and
slight
but
straight
as
a
spear
and
strong
as
an
oaken
staff
his
face
was
still
young
the
smooth
skin
was
bronzed
by
wind
and
sun
his
gray
eyes
clean
and
kind
flashed
like
fire
when
he
spoke
of
his
adventures
and
of
the
evil
deeds
of
the
false
priests
with
whom
he
contended
what
tales
he
had
told
that
day
not
of
miracles
wrought
by
sacred
relics
not
of
courts
and
councils
and
splendid
cathedrals
though
he
knew
much
of
these
things
but
he
had
spoken
of
long
journeyings
by
sea
and
land
of
perils
by
fire
and
flood
of
wolves
and
bears
and
fierce
snowstorms
and
black
nights
in
the
lonely
forest
of
dark
altars
of
heathen
gods
and
weird
bloody
sacrifices
and
narrow
escapes
from
murderous
bands
of
wandering
savages
the
little
novices
had
gathered
around
him
and
their
faces
had
grown
pale
and
their
eyes
bright
as
they
listened
with
parted
lips
entranced
in
admiration
twining
their
arms
about
one
another
s
shoulders
and
holding
closely
together
half
in
fear
half
in
delight
the
older
nuns
had
turned
from
their
tasks
and
paused
in
passing
by
to
bear
the
pilgrim
s
story
too
well
they
knew
the
truth
of
what
he
spoke
many
a
one
among
them
had
seen
the
smoke
rising
from
the
ruins
of
her
father
s
roof
many
a
one
had
a
brother
far
away
in
the
wild
country
to
whom
her
heart
went
out
night
and
day
wondering
if
he
were
still
among
the
living
but
now
the
excitements
of
that
wonderful
day
were
over
the
hour
of
the
evening
meal
had
come
the
inmates
of
the
cloister
were
assembled
in
the
refectory
on
the
dais
sat
the
stately
abbess
addula
daughter
of
king
dagobert
looking
a
princess
indeed
in
her
purple
tunic
with
the
hood
and
cuffs
of
her
long
white
robe
trimmed
with
ermine
and
a
snowy
veil
resting
like
a
crown
on
her
silver
hair
at
her
right
hand
was
the
honoured
guest
and
at
her
left
hand
her
grandson
the
young
prince
gregor
a
big
manly
boy
just
returned
from
school
the
long
shadowy
hall
with
its
rafters
and
beams
the
double
row
of
nuns
with
their
pure
veils
and
fair
faces
the
ruddy
glow
of
the
slanting
sunbeams
striking
upward
through
the
tops
of
the
windows
and
painting
a
pink
glow
high
up
on
the
walls
it
was
all
as
beautiful
as
a
picture
and
as
silent
for
this
was
the
rule
of
the
cloister
that
at
the
table
all
should
sit
in
stillness
for
a
little
while
and
then
one
should
read
aloud
while
the
rest
listened
it
is
the
turn
of
my
grandson
to
read
said
the
abbess
to
winfried
we
shall
see
how
much
he
has
learned
in
the
school
read
gregor
the
place
in
the
book
is
the
lad
rose
from
his
seat
and
turned
the
pages
of
the
manuscript
it
was
a
copy
of
jerome
s
version
of
the
scriptures
in
latin
and
the
marked
place
was
in
the
letter
of
paul
to
the
ephesians
the
passage
where
he
describes
the
preparation
of
the
christian
as
a
warrior
arming
for
battle
the
young
voice
rang
out
clearly
rolling
the
sonorous
words
without
slip
or
stumbling
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
winfried
listened
smiling
that
was
bravely
read
my
son
said
he
as
the
reader
paused
understandest
thou
what
thou
readest
surely
father
answered
the
boy
it
was
taught
me
by
the
masters
at
treves
and
we
have
read
this
epistle
from
beginning
to
end
so
that
i
almost
know
it
by
then
he
began
to
repeat
the
passage
turning
away
from
the
page
as
if
to
show
his
skill
but
winfried
stopped
him
with
a
friendly
lifting
of
the
hand
not
so
my
son
that
was
not
my
meaning
when
we
pray
we
speak
to
god
when
we
read
god
speaks
to
us
i
ask
whether
thou
hast
heard
what
he
has
said
to
thee
in
the
common
speech
come
give
us
again
the
message
of
the
warrior
and
his
armour
and
his
battle
in
the
so
that
all
can
understand
the
boy
hesitated
blushed
stammered
then
he
came
around
to
winfried
s
seat
bringing
the
book
take
the
book
my
father
he
cried
and
read
it
for
me
i
can
not
see
the
meaning
plain
though
i
love
the
sound
of
the
words
religion
i
know
and
the
doctrines
of
our
faith
and
the
life
of
priests
and
nuns
in
the
cloister
for
which
my
grandmother
designs
me
though
it
likes
me
little
and
fighting
i
know
and
the
life
of
warriors
and
heroes
for
i
have
read
of
it
in
virgil
and
the
ancients
and
heard
a
bit
from
the
soldiers
at
treves
and
i
would
fain
taste
more
of
it
for
it
likes
me
much
but
how
the
two
lives
fit
together
or
what
need
there
is
of
armour
for
a
clerk
in
holy
orders
i
can
never
see
tell
me
the
meaning
for
if
there
is
a
man
in
all
the
world
that
knows
it
i
am
sure
it
is
so
winfried
took
the
book
and
closed
it
clasping
the
boy
s
hand
with
his
own
let
us
first
dismiss
the
others
to
their
vespers
said
he
lest
they
should
be
a
sign
from
the
abbess
a
chanted
benediction
a
murmuring
of
sweet
voices
and
a
soft
rustling
of
many
feet
over
the
rushes
on
the
floor
the
gentle
tide
of
noise
flowed
out
through
the
doors
and
ebbed
away
down
the
corridors
the
three
at
the
head
of
the
table
were
left
alone
in
the
darkening
room
then
winfried
began
to
translate
the
parable
of
the
soldier
into
the
realities
of
life
at
every
turn
he
knew
how
to
flash
a
new
light
into
the
picture
out
of
his
own
experience
he
spoke
of
the
combat
with
self
and
of
the
wrestling
with
dark
spirits
in
solitude
he
spoke
of
the
demons
that
men
had
worshipped
for
centuries
in
the
wilderness
and
whose
malice
they
invoked
against
the
stranger
who
ventured
into
the
gloomy
forest
gods
they
called
them
and
told
weird
tales
of
their
dwelling
among
the
impenetrable
branches
of
the
oldest
trees
and
in
the
caverns
of
the
shaggy
hills
of
their
riding
on
the
and
hurling
spears
of
lightning
against
their
foes
gods
they
were
not
but
foul
spirits
of
the
air
rulers
of
the
darkness
was
there
not
glory
and
honour
in
fighting
them
in
daring
their
anger
under
the
shield
of
faith
in
putting
them
to
flight
with
the
sword
of
truth
what
better
adventure
could
a
brave
man
ask
than
to
go
forth
against
them
and
wrestle
with
them
and
conquer
them
look
you
my
friends
said
winfried
how
sweet
and
peaceful
is
this
convent
it
is
a
garden
full
of
flowers
in
the
heart
of
winter
a
nest
among
the
branches
of
a
great
tree
shaken
by
the
winds
a
still
haven
on
the
edge
of
a
tempestuous
sea
and
this
is
what
religion
means
for
those
who
are
chosen
and
called
to
quietude
and
prayer
and
meditation
but
out
yonder
in
the
wide
forest
who
knows
what
storms
are
raving
in
the
hearts
of
men
though
all
the
woods
are
still
who
knows
what
haunts
of
wrath
and
cruelty
are
closed
tonight
against
the
advent
of
the
prince
of
peace
and
shall
i
tell
you
what
religion
means
to
those
who
are
called
and
chosen
to
dare
and
to
fight
and
to
conquer
the
world
for
christ
it
means
to
go
against
the
strongholds
of
the
adversary
it
means
to
struggle
to
win
an
entrance
for
the
master
everywhere
what
helmet
is
strong
enough
for
this
strife
save
the
helmet
of
salvation
what
breastplate
can
guard
a
man
against
these
fiery
darts
but
the
breastplate
of
righteousness
what
shoes
can
stand
the
wear
of
these
journeys
but
the
preparation
of
the
gospel
of
peace
shoes
he
cried
again
and
laughed
as
if
a
sudden
thought
had
struck
him
he
thrust
out
his
foot
covered
with
a
heavy
cowhide
boot
laced
high
about
his
leg
with
thongs
of
skin
look
here
how
a
fighting
man
of
the
cross
is
shod
i
have
seen
the
boots
of
the
bishop
of
tours
white
kid
broidered
with
silk
a
day
in
the
bogs
would
tear
them
to
shreds
i
have
seen
the
sandals
that
the
monks
use
on
the
highroads
yes
and
worn
them
ten
pair
of
them
have
i
worn
out
and
thrown
away
in
a
single
journey
now
i
shoe
my
feet
with
the
toughest
hides
hard
as
iron
no
rock
can
cut
them
no
branches
can
tear
them
yet
more
than
one
pair
of
these
have
i
outworn
and
many
more
shall
i
outwear
ere
my
journeys
are
ended
and
i
think
if
god
is
gracious
to
me
that
i
shall
die
wearing
them
better
so
than
in
a
soft
bed
with
silken
coverings
the
boots
of
a
warrior
a
hunter
a
woodsman
these
are
my
preparation
of
the
gospel
of
peace
come
gregor
he
said
laying
his
brown
hand
on
the
youth
s
shoulder
come
wear
the
forester
s
boots
with
me
this
is
the
life
to
which
we
are
called
be
strong
in
the
lord
a
hunter
of
the
demons
a
subduer
of
the
wilderness
a
woodsman
of
the
faith
the
boy
s
eyes
sparkled
he
turned
to
his
grandmother
she
shook
her
head
vigorously
nay
father
she
said
draw
not
the
lad
away
from
my
side
with
these
wild
words
i
need
him
to
help
me
with
my
labours
to
cheer
my
old
do
you
need
him
more
than
the
master
does
asked
winfried
and
will
you
take
the
wood
that
is
fit
for
a
bow
to
make
a
distaff
but
i
fear
for
the
child
thy
life
is
too
hard
for
him
he
will
perish
with
hunger
in
the
once
said
winfried
smiling
we
were
camped
on
the
bank
of
the
river
ohru
the
table
was
set
for
the
morning
meal
but
my
comrades
cried
that
it
was
empty
the
provisions
were
exhausted
we
must
go
without
breakfast
and
perhaps
starve
before
we
could
escape
from
the
wilderness
while
they
complained
a
flew
up
from
the
river
with
flapping
wings
and
let
fall
a
great
pike
in
the
midst
of
the
camp
there
was
food
enough
and
to
spare
never
have
i
seen
the
righteous
forsaken
nor
his
seed
begging
but
the
fierce
pagans
of
the
forest
cried
the
abbess
they
may
pierce
the
boy
with
their
arrows
or
dash
out
his
brains
with
their
axes
he
is
but
a
child
too
young
for
the
danger
and
the
a
child
in
years
replied
winfried
but
a
man
in
spirit
and
if
the
hero
fall
early
in
the
battle
he
wears
the
brighter
crown
not
a
leaf
withered
not
a
flower
the
aged
princess
trembled
a
little
she
drew
gregor
close
to
her
side
and
laid
her
hand
gently
on
his
brown
hair
i
am
not
sure
that
he
wa
there
is
no
horse
in
the
stable
to
give
him
now
and
he
can
not
go
as
befits
the
grandson
of
a
gregor
looked
straight
into
her
eyes
grandmother
said
he
dear
grandmother
if
thou
wilt
not
give
me
a
horse
to
ride
with
this
man
of
god
i
will
go
with
him
ii
two
years
had
passed
since
that
in
the
cloister
of
pfalzel
a
little
company
of
pilgrims
less
than
a
score
of
men
were
travelling
slowly
northward
through
the
wide
forest
that
rolled
over
the
hills
of
central
germany
at
the
head
of
the
band
marched
winfried
clad
in
a
tunic
of
fur
with
his
long
black
robe
girt
high
above
his
waist
so
that
it
might
not
hinder
his
stride
his
hunter
s
boots
were
crusted
with
snow
drops
of
ice
sparkled
like
jewels
along
the
thongs
that
bound
his
legs
there
were
no
other
ornaments
of
his
dress
except
the
bishop
s
cross
hanging
on
his
breast
and
the
silver
clasp
that
fastened
his
cloak
about
his
neck
he
carried
a
strong
tall
staff
in
his
hand
fashioned
at
the
top
into
the
form
of
a
cross
close
beside
him
keeping
step
like
a
familiar
comrade
was
the
young
prince
gregor
long
marches
through
the
wilderness
had
stretched
his
legs
and
broadened
his
back
and
made
a
man
of
him
in
stature
as
well
as
in
spirit
his
jacket
and
cap
were
of
and
on
his
shoulder
he
carried
an
axe
with
broad
shining
blade
he
was
a
mighty
woodsman
now
and
could
make
a
spray
of
chips
fly
around
him
as
he
hewed
his
way
through
the
trunk
of
a
behind
these
leaders
followed
a
pair
of
teamsters
guiding
a
rude
sledge
loaded
with
food
and
the
equipage
of
the
camp
and
drawn
by
two
big
shaggy
horses
blowing
thick
clouds
of
steam
from
their
frosty
nostrils
tiny
icicles
hung
from
the
hairs
on
their
lips
their
flanks
were
smoking
they
sank
above
the
fetlocks
at
every
step
in
the
soft
snow
last
of
all
came
the
rear
guard
armed
with
bows
and
javelins
it
was
no
child
s
play
in
those
days
to
cross
europe
afoot
the
weird
woodland
sombre
and
illimitable
covered
hill
and
vale
and
there
were
wide
moors
where
the
wolves
hunted
in
packs
as
if
the
devil
drove
them
and
tangled
thickets
where
the
lynx
and
the
boar
made
their
lairs
fierce
bears
lurked
among
the
rocky
passes
and
had
not
yet
learned
to
fear
the
face
of
man
the
gloomy
recesses
of
the
forest
gave
shelter
to
inhabitants
who
were
still
more
cruel
and
dangerous
than
beasts
of
prey
outlaws
and
sturdy
robbers
and
mad
and
bands
of
wandering
pillagers
the
pilgrim
who
would
pass
from
the
mouth
of
the
tiber
to
the
mouth
of
the
rhine
must
trust
in
god
and
keep
his
arrows
loose
in
the
quiver
the
travellers
were
surrounded
by
an
ocean
of
trees
so
vast
so
full
of
endless
billows
that
it
seemed
to
be
pressing
on
every
side
to
overwhelm
them
gnarled
oaks
with
branches
twisted
and
knotted
as
if
in
rage
rose
in
groves
like
tidal
waves
smooth
forests
of
round
and
gray
swept
over
the
knolls
and
slopes
of
land
in
a
mighty
but
most
of
all
the
multitude
of
pines
and
firs
innumerable
and
monotonous
with
straight
stark
trunks
and
branches
woven
together
in
an
unbroken
flood
of
darkest
green
crowded
through
the
valleys
and
over
the
hills
rising
on
the
highest
ridges
into
ragged
crests
like
the
foaming
edge
of
breakers
through
this
sea
of
shadows
ran
a
narrow
stream
of
shining
whiteness
an
ancient
roman
road
covered
with
snow
it
was
as
if
some
great
ship
had
ploughed
through
the
green
ocean
long
ago
and
left
behind
it
a
thick
smooth
wake
of
foam
along
this
open
track
the
travellers
held
their
way
heavily
for
the
drifts
were
deep
warily
for
the
hard
winter
had
driven
many
packs
of
wolves
down
from
the
moors
the
steps
of
the
pilgrims
were
noiseless
but
the
sledges
creaked
over
the
dry
snow
and
the
panting
of
the
horses
throbbed
through
the
still
air
the
shadows
on
the
western
side
of
the
road
grew
longer
the
sun
declining
through
its
shallow
arch
dropped
behind
the
darkness
followed
swiftly
as
if
it
had
been
a
bird
of
prey
waiting
for
this
sign
to
swoop
down
upon
the
world
father
said
gregor
to
the
leader
surely
this
day
s
march
is
done
it
is
time
to
rest
and
eat
and
sleep
if
we
press
onward
now
we
can
not
see
our
steps
and
will
not
that
be
against
the
word
of
the
psalmist
david
who
bids
us
not
to
put
confidence
in
the
legs
of
a
man
winfried
laughed
nay
my
son
gregor
said
he
thou
hast
tripped
even
now
upon
thy
text
for
david
said
only
i
take
no
pleasure
in
the
legs
of
a
and
so
say
i
for
i
am
not
minded
to
spare
thy
legs
or
mine
until
we
come
farther
on
our
way
and
do
what
must
be
done
this
night
draw
thy
belt
tighter
my
son
and
hew
me
out
this
tree
that
is
fallen
across
the
road
for
our
campground
is
not
the
youth
obeyed
two
of
the
foresters
sprang
to
help
him
and
while
the
soft
yielded
to
the
stroke
of
the
axes
and
the
snow
flew
from
the
bending
branches
winfried
turned
and
spoke
to
his
followers
in
a
cheerful
voice
that
refreshed
them
like
wine
courage
brothers
and
forward
yet
a
little
the
moon
will
light
us
presently
and
the
path
is
plain
well
know
i
that
the
journey
is
weary
and
my
own
heart
wearies
also
for
the
home
in
england
where
those
i
love
are
keeping
feast
this
but
we
have
work
to
do
before
we
feast
for
this
is
the
yuletide
and
the
heathen
people
of
the
forest
are
gathered
at
the
of
geismar
to
worship
their
god
thor
strange
things
will
be
seen
there
and
deeds
which
make
the
soul
black
but
we
are
sent
to
lighten
their
darkness
and
we
will
teach
our
kinsmen
to
keep
a
christmas
with
us
such
as
the
woodland
has
never
known
forward
then
and
stiffen
up
the
feeble
knees
a
murmur
of
assent
came
from
the
men
even
the
horses
seemed
to
take
fresh
heart
they
flattened
their
backs
to
draw
the
heavy
loads
and
blew
the
frost
from
their
nostrils
as
they
pushed
ahead
the
night
grew
broader
and
less
oppressive
a
gate
of
brightness
was
opened
secretly
somewhere
in
the
sky
higher
and
higher
swelled
the
clear
until
it
poured
over
the
eastern
wall
of
forest
into
the
road
a
drove
of
wolves
howled
faintly
in
the
distance
but
they
were
receding
and
the
sound
soon
died
away
the
stars
sparkled
merrily
through
the
stringent
air
the
small
round
moon
shone
like
silver
little
breaths
of
dreaming
wind
wandered
across
the
pointed
as
the
pilgrims
toiled
bravely
onward
following
their
clew
of
light
through
a
labyrinth
of
darkness
after
a
while
the
road
began
to
open
out
a
little
there
were
spaces
of
fringed
with
alders
behind
which
a
boisterous
river
ran
clashing
through
spears
of
ice
rude
houses
of
hewn
logs
appeared
in
the
openings
each
one
casting
a
patch
of
inky
shadow
upon
the
snow
then
the
travellers
passed
a
larger
group
of
dwellings
all
silent
and
unlighted
and
beyond
they
saw
a
great
house
with
many
outbuildings
and
inclosed
courtyards
from
which
the
hounds
bayed
furiously
and
a
noise
of
stamping
horses
came
from
the
stalls
but
there
was
no
other
sound
of
life
the
fields
around
lay
naked
to
the
moon
they
saw
no
man
except
that
once
on
a
path
that
skirted
the
farther
edge
of
a
meadow
three
dark
figures
passed
them
running
very
swiftly
then
the
road
plunged
again
into
a
dense
thicket
traversed
it
and
climbing
to
the
left
emerged
suddenly
upon
a
glade
round
and
level
except
at
the
northern
side
where
a
hillock
was
crowned
with
a
huge
it
towered
above
the
heath
a
giant
with
contorted
arms
beckoning
to
the
host
of
lesser
trees
here
cried
winfried
as
his
eyes
flashed
and
his
hand
lifted
his
heavy
staff
here
is
the
and
here
the
cross
of
christ
shall
break
the
hammer
of
the
false
god
withered
leaves
still
clung
to
the
branches
of
the
oak
torn
and
faded
banners
of
the
departed
summer
the
bright
crimson
of
autumn
had
long
since
disappeared
bleached
away
by
the
storms
and
the
cold
but
these
tattered
remnants
of
glory
were
red
again
ancient
bloodstains
against
the
sky
for
an
immense
fire
had
been
kindled
in
front
of
the
tree
tongues
of
ruddy
flame
fountains
of
ruby
sparks
ascended
through
the
spreading
limbs
and
flung
a
fierce
illumination
upward
and
around
the
pale
pure
moonlight
that
bathed
the
surrounding
forests
was
quenched
and
eclipsed
here
not
a
beam
of
it
sifted
through
the
branches
of
the
oak
it
stood
like
a
pillar
of
cloud
between
the
still
light
of
heaven
and
the
crackling
flashing
fire
of
earth
but
the
fire
itself
was
invisible
to
winfried
and
his
companions
a
great
throng
of
people
were
gathered
around
it
in
a
their
backs
to
the
open
glade
their
faces
toward
the
oak
seen
against
that
glowing
background
it
was
but
the
silhouette
of
a
crowd
vague
black
formless
mysterious
the
travellers
paused
for
a
moment
at
the
edge
of
the
thicket
and
took
counsel
together
it
is
the
assembly
of
the
tribe
said
one
of
the
foresters
the
great
night
of
the
council
i
heard
of
it
three
days
ago
as
we
passed
through
one
of
the
villages
all
who
swear
by
the
old
gods
have
been
summoned
they
will
sacrifice
a
steed
to
the
god
of
war
and
drink
blood
and
eat
to
make
them
strong
it
will
be
at
the
peril
of
our
lives
if
we
approach
them
at
least
we
must
hide
the
cross
if
we
would
escape
hide
me
no
cross
cried
winfried
lifting
his
staff
for
i
have
come
to
show
it
and
to
make
these
blind
folk
see
its
power
there
is
more
to
be
done
here
than
the
slaying
of
a
steed
and
a
greater
evil
to
be
stayed
than
the
shameful
eating
of
meat
sacrificed
to
idols
i
have
seen
it
in
a
dream
here
the
cross
must
stand
and
be
our
at
his
command
the
sledge
was
left
in
the
border
of
the
wood
with
two
of
the
men
to
guard
it
and
the
rest
of
the
company
moved
forward
across
the
open
ground
they
approached
unnoticed
for
all
the
multitude
were
looking
intently
toward
the
fire
at
the
foot
of
the
oak
then
winfried
s
voice
rang
out
hail
ye
sons
of
the
forest
a
stranger
claims
the
warmth
of
your
fire
in
the
winter
swiftly
and
as
with
a
single
motion
a
thousand
eyes
were
bent
upon
the
speaker
the
semicircle
opened
silently
in
the
middle
winfried
entered
with
his
followers
it
closed
again
behind
them
then
as
they
looked
round
the
curving
ranks
they
saw
that
the
hue
of
the
assemblage
was
not
black
but
white
dazzling
radiant
solemn
white
the
robes
of
the
women
clustered
together
at
the
points
of
the
wide
crescent
white
the
glittering
byrnies
of
the
warriors
standing
in
close
ranks
white
the
fur
mantles
of
the
aged
men
who
held
the
central
palace
in
the
circle
white
with
the
shimmer
of
silver
ornaments
and
the
purity
of
lamb
the
raiment
of
a
little
group
of
children
who
stood
close
by
the
fire
white
with
awe
and
fear
the
faces
of
all
who
looked
at
them
and
over
all
the
flickering
dancing
radiance
of
the
flames
played
and
glimmered
like
a
faint
vanishing
tinge
of
blood
on
snow
the
only
figure
untouched
by
the
glow
was
the
old
priest
hunrad
with
his
long
spectral
robe
flowing
hair
and
beard
and
face
who
stood
with
his
back
to
the
fire
and
advanced
slowly
to
meet
the
strangers
who
are
you
whence
come
you
and
what
seek
you
here
your
kinsman
am
i
of
the
german
brotherhood
answered
winfried
and
from
england
beyond
the
sea
have
i
come
to
bring
you
a
greeting
from
that
land
and
a
message
from
the
whose
servant
i
welcome
then
said
hunrad
welcome
kinsman
and
be
silent
for
what
passes
here
is
too
high
to
wait
and
must
be
done
before
the
moon
crosses
the
middle
heaven
unless
indeed
thou
hast
some
sign
or
token
from
the
gods
canst
thou
work
miracles
the
question
came
sharply
as
if
a
sudden
gleam
of
hope
had
flashed
through
the
tangle
of
the
old
priest
s
mind
but
winfried
s
voice
sank
lower
and
a
cloud
of
disappointment
passed
over
his
face
as
he
replied
nay
miracles
have
i
never
wrought
though
i
have
heard
of
many
but
the
has
given
no
power
to
my
hands
save
such
as
belongs
to
common
stand
still
then
thou
common
man
said
hunrad
scornfully
and
behold
what
the
gods
have
called
us
hither
to
do
this
night
is
the
of
the
baldur
the
beautiful
beloved
of
gods
and
men
this
night
is
the
hour
of
darkness
and
the
power
of
winter
of
sacrifice
and
mighty
fear
this
night
the
great
thor
the
god
of
thunder
and
war
to
whom
this
oak
is
sacred
is
grieved
for
the
death
of
baldur
and
angry
with
this
people
because
they
have
forsaken
his
worship
long
is
it
since
an
offering
has
been
laid
upon
his
altar
long
since
the
roots
of
his
holy
tree
have
been
fed
with
blood
therefore
its
leaves
have
withered
before
the
time
and
its
boughs
are
heavy
with
death
therefore
the
slavs
and
the
wends
have
beaten
us
in
battle
therefore
the
harvests
have
failed
and
the
have
ravaged
the
folds
and
the
strength
has
departed
from
the
bow
and
the
wood
of
the
spear
has
broken
and
the
wild
boar
has
slain
the
huntsman
therefore
the
plague
has
fallen
on
our
dwellings
and
the
dead
are
more
than
the
living
in
all
our
villages
answer
me
ye
people
are
not
these
things
true
a
hoarse
sound
of
approval
ran
through
the
circle
a
chant
in
which
the
voices
of
the
men
and
women
blended
like
the
shrill
wind
in
the
pinetrees
above
the
rumbling
thunder
of
a
waterfall

and
fell

with
two
great
shouts
the
song
ended
and
stillness
followed
so
intense
that
the
crackling
of
the
fire
was
heard
distinctly
the
old
priest
stood
silent
for
a
moment
his
shaggy
brows
swept
down
ever
his
eyes
like
ashes
quenching
flame
then
he
lifted
his
face
and
spoke
none

things

offering

cleanse

hunrad
moved
nearer
to
the
group
of
children
who
stood
watching
the
fire
and
the
swarms
of
darting
upward
they
had
heeded
none
of
the
priest
s
words
and
did
not
notice
now
that
he
approached
them
so
eager
were
they
to
see
which
fiery
snake
would
go
highest
among
the
oak
branches
foremost
among
them
and
most
intent
on
the
pretty
game
was
a
boy
like
a
sunbeam
slender
and
quick
with
blithe
brown
eyes
and
laughing
lips
the
priest
s
hand
was
laid
upon
his
shoulder
the
boy
turned
and
looked
up
in
his
face
here
said
the
old
man
with
his
voice
vibrating
as
when
a
thick
rope
is
strained
by
a
ship
swinging
from
her
moorings
here
is
the
chosen
one
the
eldest
son
of
the
chief
the
darling
of
the
people
hearken
bernhard
wilt
thou
go
to
valhalla
where
the
heroes
dwell
with
the
gods
to
bear
a
message
to
thor
the
boy
answered
swift
and
clear
yes
priest
i
will
go
if
my
father
bids
me
is
it
far
away
shall
i
run
quickly

i
take
my
bow
and
arrows
for
the
wolves
the
boy
s
father
the
chieftain
gundhar
standing
among
his
bearded
warriors
drew
his
breath
deep
and
leaned
so
heavily
on
the
handle
of
his
spear
that
the
wood
cracked
and
his
wife
irma
bending
forward
from
the
ranks
of
women
pushed
the
golden
hair
from
her
forehead
with
one
hand
the
other
dragged
at
the
silver
chain
about
her
neck
until
the
rough
links
pierced
her
flesh
and
the
red
drops
fell
unheeded
on
her
breast
a
sigh
passed
through
the
crowd
like
the
murmur
of
the
forest
before
the
storm
breaks
yet
no
one
spoke
save
hunrad
yes
my
prince
both
bow
and
spear
shalt
thou
have
for
the
way
is
long
and
thou
art
a
brave
huntsman
but
in
darkness
thou
must
journey
for
a
little
space
and
with
eyes
blindfolded
fearest
thou
naught

said
the
boy
neither
darkness
nor
the
great
bear
nor
the
for
i
am
gundhar
s
son
and
the
defender
of
my
then
the
priest
led
the
child
in
his
raiment
of
lamb
to
a
broad
stone
in
front
of
the
fire
he
gave
him
his
little
bow
tipped
with
silver
and
his
spear
with
shining
head
of
steel
he
bound
the
child
s
eyes
with
a
white
cloth
and
bade
him
kneel
beside
the
stone
with
his
face
to
the
cast
unconsciously
the
wide
arc
of
spectators
drew
inward
toward
the
centre
as
the
ends
of
the
bow
draw
together
when
the
cord
is
stretched
winfried
moved
noiselessly
until
he
stood
close
behind
the
priest
the
old
man
stooped
to
lift
a
black
hammer
of
stone
from
the
ground
the
sacred
hammer
of
the
god
thor
summoning
all
the
strength
of
his
withered
arms
he
swung
it
high
in
the
air
it
poised
for
an
instant
above
the
child
s
fair
head
then
turned
to
fall
one
keen
cry
shrilled
out
from
where
the
women
stood
me
take
me
not
bernhard
the
flight
of
the
mother
toward
her
child
was
swift
as
the
falcon
s
swoop
but
swifter
still
was
the
hand
of
the
deliverer
winfried
s
heavy
staff
thrust
mightily
against
the
hammer
s
handle
as
it
fell
sideways
it
glanced
from
the
old
man
s
grasp
and
the
black
stone
striking
on
the
altar
s
edge
split
in
twain
a
shout
of
awe
and
joy
rolled
along
the
living
circle
the
branches
of
the
oak
shivered
the
flames
leaped
higher
as
the
shout
died
away
the
people
saw
the
lady
irma
with
her
arms
clasped
round
her
child
and
above
them
on
the
winfried
his
face
shining
like
the
face
of
an
angel
iv
a
swift
rolling
down
its
channel
a
huge
rock
tumbling
from
the
and
falling
in
the
baffled
waters
broken
and
confused
pausing
in
their
flow
dash
high
against
the
rock
foaming
and
murmuring
with
divided
impulse
uncertain
whether
to
turn
to
the
right
or
the
left
even
so
winfried
s
bold
deed
fell
into
the
midst
of
the
thoughts
and
passions
of
the
council
they
were
at
a
standstill
anger
and
wonder
reverence
and
joy
and
confusion
surged
through
the
crowd
they
knew
not
which
way
to
move
to
resent
the
intrusion
of
the
stranger
as
an
insult
to
their
gods
or
to
welcome
him
as
the
rescuer
of
their
prince
the
old
priest
crouched
by
the
altar
silent
conflicting
counsels
troubled
the
air
let
the
sacrifice
go
forward
the
gods
must
be
appeased
nay
the
boy
must
not
die
bring
the
chieftain
s
best
horse
and
slay
it
in
his
stead
it
will
be
enough
the
holy
tree
loves
the
blood
of
horses
not
so
there
is
a
better
counsel
yet
seize
the
stranger
whom
the
gods
have
led
hither
as
a
victim
and
make
his
life
pay
the
forfeit
of
his
daring
the
withered
leaves
on
the
oak
rustled
and
whispered
overhead
the
fire
flared
and
sank
again
the
angry
voices
clashed
against
each
other
and
fell
like
opposing
waves
then
the
chieftain
gundhar
struck
the
earth
with
his
spear
and
gave
his
decision
all
have
spoken
but
none
are
agreed
there
is
no
voice
of
the
council
keep
silence
now
and
let
the
stranger
speak
his
words
shall
give
us
judgment
whether
he
is
to
live
or
to
winfried
lifted
himself
high
upon
the
altar
drew
a
roll
of
parchment
from
his
bosom
and
began
to
read
a
letter
from
the
great
bishop
of
rome
who
sits
on
a
golden
throne
to
the
people
of
the
forest
hessians
and
thuringians
franks
and
saxons
in
nomin
domini
sanctae
et
individuae
trinitatis
amen
a
murmur
of
awe
ran
through
the
crowd
it
is
the
sacred
tongue
of
the
romans
the
tongue
that
is
heard
and
understood
by
the
wise
men
of
every
land
there
is
magic
in
it
listen
winfried
went
on
to
read
the
letter
translating
it
into
the
speech
of
the
people
we
have
sent
unto
you
our
brother
boniface
and
appointed
him
your
bishop
that
he
may
teach
you
the
only
true
faith
and
baptise
you
and
lead
you
back
from
the
ways
of
error
to
the
path
of
salvation
hearken
to
him
in
all
things
like
a
father
bow
your
hearts
to
his
teaching
he
comes
not
for
earthly
gain
but
for
the
gain
of
your
souls
depart
from
evil
works
worship
not
the
false
gods
for
they
are
devils
offer
no
more
bloody
sacrifices
nor
eat
the
flesh
of
horses
but
do
as
our
brother
boniface
commands
you
build
a
house
for
him
that
he
may
dwell
among
you
and
a
church
where
you
may
offer
your
prayers
to
the
only
living
god
the
almighty
king
of
it
was
a
splendid
message
proud
strong
peaceful
loving
the
dignity
of
the
words
imposed
mightily
upon
the
hearts
of
the
people
they
were
quieted
as
men
who
have
listened
to
a
lofty
strain
of
music
tell
us
then
said
gundhar
what
is
the
word
that
thou
bringest
to
us
from
the
almighty
what
is
thy
counsel
for
the
tribes
of
the
woodland
on
this
night
of
sacrifice
this
is
the
word
and
this
is
the
counsel
answered
winfried
not
a
drop
of
blood
shall
fall
save
that
which
pity
has
drawn
from
the
breast
of
your
princess
in
love
for
her
child
not
a
life
shall
be
blotted
out
in
the
darkness
but
the
great
shadow
of
the
tree
which
hides
you
from
the
light
of

be
swept
away

men
took
their
places
facing
each
other
one
on
each
side
of
the
oak
their
cloaks
were
flung
aside
their
heads
bare
carefully
they
felt
the
ground
with
their
feet
seeking
a
firm
grip
of
the
earth
firmly
they
grasped
the
and
swung
the
shining
blades
cried
winfried
art
thou
angry
thus
we
smite
thee
answered
gregor
art
thou
mighty
thus
we
fight
thee
clang
clang
the
alternate
strokes
beat
time
upon
the
hard
ringing
wood
the
glittered
in
their
rhythmic
flight
like
fierce
eagles
circling
about
their
quarry
the
broad
flakes
of
wood
flew
from
the
deepening
gashes
in
the
sides
of
the
oak
the
huge
trunk
quivered
there
was
a
shuddering
in
the
branches
then
the
great
wonder
of
winfried
s
life
came
to
pass
out
of
the
stillness
of
the
winter
night
a
mighty
rushing
noise
sounded
overhead
was
it
the
ancient
gods
on
their
white
battlesteeds
with
their
black
hounds
of
wrath
and
their
arrows
of
lightning
sweeping
through
the
air
to
destroy
their
foes
a
strong
whirling
wind
passed
over
the
treetops
it
gripped
the
oak
by
its
branches
and
tore
it
from
the
roots
backward
it
fell
like
a
ruined
tower
groaning
and
crashing
as
it
split
asunder
in
four
great
pieces
winfried
let
his
axe
drop
and
bowed
his
head
for
a
moment
in
the
presence
of
almighty
power
then
he
turned
to
the
people
here
is
the
timber
he
cried
already
felled
and
split
for
your
new
building
on
this
spot
shall
rise
a
chapel
to
the
true
god
and
his
servant
peter
and
here
said
he
as
his
eyes
fell
on
a
young
standing
straight
and
green
with
its
top
pointing
toward
the
stars
amid
the
divided
ruins
of
the
fallen
oak
here
is
the
living
tree
with
no
stain
of
blood
upon
it
that
shall
be
the
sign
of
your
new
worship
see
how
it
points
to
the
sky
call
it
the
tree
of
the
take
it
up
and
carry
it
to
the
chieftain
s
hall
you
shall
go
no
more
into
the
shadows
of
the
forest
to
keep
your
feasts
with
secret
rites
of
shame
you
shall
keep
them
at
home
with
laughter
and
songs
and
rites
of
love
the
has
fallen
and
i
think
the
day
is
coming
when
there
shall
not
be
a
home
in
all
germany
where
the
children
are
not
gathered
around
the
green
to
rejoice
in
the
of
so
they
took
the
little
fir
from
its
place
and
carried
it
in
joyous
procession
to
the
edge
of
the
glade
and
laid
it
on
the
sledge
the
horses
tossed
their
heads
and
drew
their
load
bravely
as
if
the
new
burden
had
made
it
lighter
when
they
came
to
the
house
of
gundhar
he
bade
them
throw
open
the
doors
of
the
hall
and
set
the
tree
in
the
midst
of
it
they
kindled
lights
among
the
branches
until
it
seemed
to
be
tangled
full
of
the
children
encircled
it
wondering
and
the
sweet
odour
of
the
balsam
filled
the
house
then
winfried
stood
beside
the
chair
of
gundhar
on
the
dais
at
the
end
of
the
hall
and
told
the
story
of
bethlehem
of
the
babe
in
the
manger
of
the
shepherds
on
the
hills
of
the
host
of
angels
and
their
midnight
song
all
the
people
listened
charmed
into
stillness
but
the
boy
bernhard
on
irma
s
knee
folded
in
her
soft
arms
grew
restless
as
the
story
lengthened
and
began
to
prattle
softly
at
his
mother
s
ear
mother
whispered
the
child
why
did
you
cry
out
so
loud
when
the
priest
was
going
to
send
me
to
valhalla
oh
hush
my
child
answered
the
mother
and
pressed
him
closer
to
her
side
mother
whispered
the
boy
again
laying
his
finger
on
the
stains
upon
her
breast
see
your
dress
is
red
what
are
these
stains
did
some
one
hurt
you
the
mother
closed
his
mouth
with
a
kiss
dear
be
still
and
listen
the
boy
obeyed
his
eyes
were
heavy
with
sleep
but
he
heard
the
last
words
of
winfried
as
he
spoke
of
the
angelic
messengers
flying
over
the
hills
of
judea
and
singing
as
they
flew
the
child
wondered
and
dreamed
and
listened
suddenly
his
face
grew
bright
he
put
his
lips
close
to
irma
s
cheek
again
oh
mother
he
whispered
very
low
do
not
speak
do
you
hear
them
those
angels
have
come
back
again
they
are
singing
now
behind
the
and
some
say
that
it
was
true
but
others
say
that
it
was
only
gregor
and
his
companions
at
the
lower
end
of
the
hall
chanting
their
christmas
hymn
all
glory
be
to
god
on
high
and
on
the
earth
be
peace
henceforth
from
heaven
to
man
begin
and
never
cease
