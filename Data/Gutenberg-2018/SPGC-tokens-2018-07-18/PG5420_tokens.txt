preface
four
years
ago
my
uncle
the
rev
smith
of
biggar
asked
me
to
give
a
lecture
in
my
native
village
the
shrewd
little
capital
of
the
upper
ward
i
never
lectured
before
i
have
no
turn
for
it
but
avunculus
was
urgent
and
i
had
an
odd
sort
of
desire
to
say
something
to
these
primitive
people
of
my
youth
who
were
boys
and
girls
when
i
left
them
i
could
think
of
nothing
to
give
them
at
last
i
said
to
myself
i
tell
them
ailie
story
i
had
often
told
it
to
myself
indeed
it
came
on
me
at
intervals
almost
painfully
as
if
demanding
to
be
told
as
if
i
heard
rab
whining
at
the
door
to
get
in
or
out
whispering
how
meek
and
gentle
he
could
be
or
as
if
james
was
entreating
me
on
his
to
tell
all
the
world
what
his
ailie
was
but
it
was
easier
said
than
done
i
tried
it
over
and
over
in
vain
at
last
after
a
happy
dinner
at
hanley
why
are
the
dinners
always
happy
at
hanley
and
a
drive
home
alone
through
the
gleam
the
shadow
and
the
peace
supreme
of
a
midsummer
night
i
sat
down
about
twelve
and
rose
at
four
having
finished
it
i
slunk
off
to
bed
satisfied
and
cold
i
do
think
i
made
almost
any
changes
in
it
i
read
it
to
the
biggar
folk
in
the
very
frightened
and
felt
i
was
reading
it
ill
and
their
honest
faces
intimated
as
much
in
their
affectionate
puzzled
looks
i
gave
it
on
my
return
home
to
some
friends
who
liked
the
story
and
the
first
idea
was
to
print
it
as
now
with
illustrations
on
the
principle
of
rogers
joke
that
it
would
be
dished
except
for
the
plates
but
i
got
afraid
of
the
public
and
paused
meanwhile
some
good
friend
said
rab
might
be
thrown
in
among
the
other
idle
hours
and
so
he
was
and
it
is
a
great
pleasure
to
me
to
think
how
many
new
friends
he
got
i
was
at
biggar
the
other
day
and
some
of
the
good
folks
told
me
with
a
grave
smile
peculiar
to
that
region
that
when
rab
came
to
them
in
print
he
was
so
good
that
they
would
believe
he
was
the
same
rab
i
had
delivered
in
the
a
testimony
to
my
vocal
powers
of
impressing
the
multitude
somewhat
conclusive
i
need
not
add
that
this
little
story
is
in
all
essentials
true
though
if
i
were
shakespeare
it
might
be
curious
to
point
out
where
phantasy
tried
her
hand
sometimes
where
least
suspected
it
has
been
objected
to
it
as
a
work
of
art
that
there
is
too
much
pain
and
many
have
said
to
me
with
some
bitterness
why
did
you
make
me
suffer
so
but
i
think
of
my
father
answer
when
i
told
him
this
and
why
should
they
suffer
she
suffered
it
will
do
them
good
for
pity
genuine
pity
is
as
old
aristotle
says
power
to
purge
the
mind
and
though
in
all
works
of
art
there
should
be
a
plus
of
delectation
the
ultimate
overcoming
of
evil
and
sorrow
by
good
and
joy
the
end
of
all
art
being
pleasure
whatsoever
things
are
lovely
first
and
things
that
are
true
and
of
good
report
afterwards
in
their
turn
still
there
is
a
pleasure
one
of
the
strangest
and
strongest
in
our
nature
in
imaginative
suffering
with
and
for
others
in
the
soothing
thoughts
that
spring
out
of
human
suffering
for
sympathy
is
worth
nothing
is
indeed
not
itself
unless
it
has
in
it
somewhat
of
personal
pain
it
is
the
hereafter
that
gives
to
the
touch
of
a
vanished
hand
and
the
sound
of
a
voice
that
is
still
its
own
infinite
meaning
our
hearts
and
our
understandings
follow
ailie
and
her
ain
man
into
that
world
where
there
is
no
pain
where
no
one
says
i
am
sick
what
is
all
the
philosophy
of
cicero
the
wailing
of
catullus
and
the
gloomy
playfulness
of
horace
variations
on
let
us
eat
and
drink
with
its
terrific
for
to
the
simple
faith
of
the
carrier
and
his
wife
in
i
am
the
resurrection
and
the
life
i
think
i
can
hear

across
the
fields
of

rab
and

friends
years
ago
bob
ainslie
and
i
were
coming
up
infirmary
street
from
the
high
school
our
heads
together
and
our
arms
intertwisted
as
only
lovers
and
boys
know
how
or
why
when
we
got
to
the
top
of
the
street
and
turned
north
we
espied
a
crowd
at
the
tron
church
a
shouted
bob
and
was
off
and
so
was
i
both
of
us
all
but
praying
that
it
might
not
be
over
before
we
got
up
and
is
not
this
and
human
nature
too
and
we
all
wish
a
house
on
fire
not
to
be
out
before
we
see
it
dogs
like
fighting
old
isaac
says
they
delight
in
it
and
for
the
best
of
all
reasons
and
boys
are
not
cruel
because
they
like
to
see
the
fight
they
see
three
of
the
great
cardinal
virtues
of
dog
or
man
courage
endurance
and
skill
in
intense
action
this
is
very
different
from
a
love
of
making
dogs
fight
and
enjoying
and
aggravating
and
making
gain
by
their
pluck
a
boy
be
he
ever
so
fond
himself
of
fighting
if
he
be
a
good
boy
hates
and
despises
all
this
but
he
would
have
run
off
with
bob
and
me
fast
enough
it
is
a
natural
and
a
not
wicked
interest
that
all
boys
and
men
have
in
witnessing
intense
energy
in
action
does
any
curious
and
woman
wish
to
know
how
bob
eye
at
a
glance
announced
a
to
his
brain
he
did
not
he
could
not
see
the
dogs
fighting
it
was
a
flash
of
an
inference
a
rapid
induction
the
crowd
round
a
couple
of
dogs
fighting
is
a
crowd
masculine
mainly
with
an
occasional
active
compassionate
woman
fluttering
wildly
round
the
outside
and
using
her
tongue
and
her
hands
freely
upon
the
men
as
so
many
brutes
it
is
a
crowd
annular
compact
and
mobile
a
crowd
centripetal
having
its
eyes
and
its
heads
all
bent
downwards
and
inwards
to
one
common
focus
well
bob
and
i
are
up
and
find
it
is
not
over
a
small
thoroughbred
white
bull
terrier
is
busy
throttling
a
large
shepherd
dog
unaccustomed
to
war
but
not
to
be
trifled
with
they
are
hard
at
it
the
scientific
little
fellow
doing
his
work
in
great
style
his
pastoral
enemy
fighting
wildly
but
with
the
sharpest
of
teeth
and
a
great
courage
science
and
breeding
however
soon
had
their
own
the
game
chicken
as
the
premature
bob
called
him
working
his
way
up
took
his
final
grip
of
poor
yarrow
throat
and
he
lay
gasping
and
done
for
his
master
a
brown
handsome
big
young
shepherd
from
tweedsmuir
would
have
liked
to
have
knocked
down
any
man
would
drink
up
esil
or
eat
a
crocodile
for
that
part
if
he
had
a
chance
it
was
no
use
kicking
the
little
dog
that
would
only
make
him
hold
the
closer
many
were
the
means
shouted
out
in
mouthfuls
of
the
best
possible
ways
of
ending
it
water
but
there
was
none
near
and
many
cried
for
it
who
might
have
got
it
from
the
well
at
blackfriar
wynd
bite
the
tail
and
a
large
vague
benevolent
man
more
desirous
than
wise
with
some
struggle
got
the
bushy
end
of
yarrow
tail
into
his
ample
mouth
and
bit
it
with
all
his
might
this
was
more
than
enough
for
the
shepherd
who
with
a
gleam
of
joy
over
his
broad
visage
delivered
a
terrific
facer
upon
our
large
vague
benevolent
friend
who
went
down
like
a
shot
still
the
chicken
holds
death
not
far
off
snuff
a
pinch
of
snuff
observed
a
calm
young
buck
with
an
in
his
eye
snuff
indeed
growled
the
angry
crowd
affronted
and
glaring
snuff
a
pinch
of
snuff
again
observes
the
buck
but
with
more
urgency
whereon
were
produced
several
open
boxes
and
from
a
mull
which
may
have
been
at
culloden
he
took
a
pinch
knelt
down
and
presented
it
to
the
nose
of
the
chicken
the
laws
of
physiology
and
of
snuff
take
their
course
the
chicken
sneezes
and
yarrow
is
free
the
young
pastoral
giant
stalks
off
with
yarrow
in
his
arms
comforting
him
but
the
bull
terrier
blood
is
up
and
his
soul
unsatisfied
he
grips
the
first
dog
he
meets
and
discovering
she
is
not
a
dog
in
homeric
phrase
he
makes
a
brief
sort
of
amende
and
is
off
the
boys
with
bob
and
me
at
their
head
are
after
him
down
niddry
street
he
goes
bent
on
mischief
up
the
cowgate
like
an
arrow
bob
and
i
and
our
small
men
panting
behind
there
under
the
single
arch
of
the
south
bridge
is
a
huge
mastiff
sauntering
down
the
middle
of
the
causeway
as
if
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
he
is
old
gray
brindled
as
big
as
a
little
highland
bull
and
has
the
shakespearian
dewlaps
shaking
as
he
goes
the
chicken
makes
straight
at
him
and
fastens
on
his
throat
to
our
astonishment
the
great
creature
does
nothing
but
stand
still
hold
himself
up
and
roar
yes
roar
a
long
serious
remonstrative
roar
how
is
this
bob
and
i
are
up
to
them
he
is
muzzled
the
bailies
had
proclaimed
a
general
muzzling
and
his
master
studying
strength
and
economy
mainly
had
encompassed
his
huge
jaws
in
a
apparatus
constructed
out
of
the
leather
of
some
ancient
breechin
his
mouth
was
open
as
far
as
it
could
his
lips
curled
up
in
rage
a
sort
of
terrible
grin
his
teeth
gleaming
ready
from
out
the
darkness
the
strap
across
his
mouth
tense
as
a
his
whole
frame
stiff
with
indignation
and
surprise
his
roar
asking
us
all
around
did
you
ever
see
the
like
of
this
he
looked
a
statue
of
anger
and
astonishment
done
in
aberdeen
granite
we
soon
had
a
crowd
the
chicken
held
on
a
knife
cried
bob
and
a
cobbler
gave
him
his
knife
you
know
the
kind
of
knife
worn
away
obliquely
to
a
point
and
always
keen
i
put
its
edge
to
the
tense
leather
it
ran
before
it
and
then
one
sudden
jerk
of
that
enormous
head
a
sort
of
dirty
mist
about
his
mouth
no
noise
and
the
bright
and
fierce
little
fellow
is
dropped
limp
and
dead
a
solemn
pause
this
was
more
than
any
of
us
had
bargained
for
i
turned
the
little
fellow
over
and
saw
he
was
quite
dead
the
mastiff
had
taken
him
by
the
small
of
the
back
like
a
rat
and
broken
it
he
looked
down
at
his
victim
appeased
ashamed
and
amazed
snuffed
him
all
over
stared
at
him
and
taking
a
sudden
thought
turned
round
and
trotted
off
bob
took
the
dead
dog
up
and
said
john
we
bury
him
after
tea
yes
said
i
and
was
off
after
the
mastiff
he
made
up
the
cowgate
at
a
rapid
swing
he
had
forgotten
some
engagement
he
turned
up
the
candlemaker
row
and
stopped
at
the
harrow
inn
there
was
a
carrier
cart
ready
to
start
and
a
keen
thin
impatient
little
man
his
hand
at
his
gray
horse
head
looking
about
angrily
for
something
rab
ye
thief
said
he
aiming
a
kick
at
my
great
friend
who
drew
cringing
up
and
avoiding
the
heavy
shoe
with
more
agility
than
dignity
and
watching
his
master
eye
slunk
dismayed
under
the
cart
his
ears
down
and
as
much
as
he
had
of
tail
down
too
what
a
man
this
must
be
thought
i
to
whom
my
tremendous
hero
turns
tail
the
carrier
saw
the
muzzle
hanging
cut
and
useless
from
his
neck
and
i
eagerly
told
him
the
story
which
bob
and
i
always
thought
and
still
think
homer
or
king
david
or
sir
walter
alone
were
worthy
to
rehearse
the
severe
little
man
was
mitigated
and
condescended
to
say
rab
ma
man
puir
rabbie
whereupon
the
stump
of
a
tail
rose
up
the
ears
were
cocked
the
eyes
filled
and
were
comforted
the
two
friends
were
reconciled
hupp
and
a
stroke
of
the
whip
were
given
to
jess
and
off
went
the
three
bob
and
i
buried
the
game
chicken
that
night
we
had
not
much
of
a
tea
in
the
of
his
house
in
melville
street
no
with
considerable
gravity
and
silence
and
being
at
the
time
in
the
iliad
and
like
all
boys
trojans
we
called
him
hector
of
course
six
years
have
passed
a
long
time
for
a
boy
and
a
dog
bob
ainslie
is
off
to
the
wars
i
am
a
medical
student
and
clerk
at
minto
house
hospital
rab
i
saw
almost
every
week
on
the
wednesday
and
we
had
much
pleasant
intimacy
i
found
the
way
to
his
heart
by
frequent
scratching
of
his
huge
head
and
an
occasional
bone
when
i
did
not
notice
him
he
would
plant
himself
straight
before
me
and
stand
wagging
that
bud
of
a
tail
and
looking
up
with
his
head
a
little
to
the
one
side
his
master
i
occasionally
saw
he
used
to
call
me
maister
john
but
was
laconic
as
any
spartan
one
fine
october
afternoon
i
was
leaving
the
hospital
when
i
saw
the
large
gate
open
and
in
walked
rab
with
that
great
and
easy
saunter
of
his
he
looked
as
if
taking
general
possession
of
the
place
like
the
duke
of
wellington
entering
a
subdued
city
satiated
with
victory
and
peace
after
him
came
jess
now
white
from
age
with
her
cart
and
in
it
a
woman
carefully
wrapped
up
the
carrier
leading
the
horse
anxiously
and
looking
back
when
he
saw
me
james
for
his
name
was
james
noble
made
a
curt
and
grotesque
boo
and
said
maister
john
this
is
the
mistress
she
got
a
trouble
in
her
breest
some
kind
o
an
income
we
thinkin
by
this
time
i
saw
the
woman
face
she
was
sitting
on
a
sack
filled
with
straw
her
husband
plaid
round
her
and
his
with
its
large
white
metal
buttons
over
her
feet
i
never
saw
a
more
unforgettable
face
pale
serious
lonely
footnote
it
is
not
easy
giving
this
look
by
one
word
it
was
expressive
of
her
being
so
much
of
her
life
alone
delicate
sweet
without
being
at
all
what
we
call
fine
she
looked
sixty
and
had
on
a
mutch
white
as
snow
with
its
black
ribbon
her
silvery
smooth
hair
setting
off
her
eyes
eyes
such
as
one
sees
only
twice
or
thrice
in
a
lifetime
full
of
suffering
full
also
of
the
overcoming
of
it
her
eyebrows
footnote
black
brows
they
say
become
some
women
best
so
that
there
be
not
too
much
hair
there
but
in
a
semicircle
or
a
made
with
a
pen
a
winter
tale
black
and
delicate
and
her
mouth
firm
patient
and
contented
which
few
mouths
ever
are
as
i
have
said
i
never
saw
a
more
beautiful
countenance
or
one
more
subdued
to
settled
quiet
ailie
said
james
this
is
maister
john
the
young
doctor
rab
freend
ye
ken
we
often
speak
aboot
you
doctor
she
smiled
and
made
a
movement
but
said
nothing
and
prepared
to
come
down
putting
her
plaid
aside
and
rising
had
solomon
in
all
his
glory
been
handing
down
the
queen
of
sheba
at
his
palace
gate
he
could
not
have
done
it
more
daintily
more
tenderly
more
like
a
gentleman
than
did
james
the
howgate
carrier
when
he
lifted
down
ailie
his
wife
the
contrast
of
his
small
swarthy
keen
worldly
face
to
hers
pale
subdued
and
beautiful
was
something
wonderful
rab
looked
on
concerned
and
puzzled
but
ready
for
anything
that
might
turn
up
were
it
to
strangle
the
nurse
the
porter
or
even
me
ailie
and
he
seemed
great
friends
as
i
was
sayin
she
got
a
kind
o
trouble
in
her
breest
doctor
wull
ye
tak
a
look
at
it
we
walked
into
the
all
four
rab
grim
and
comic
willing
to
be
happy
and
confidential
if
cause
could
be
shown
willing
also
to
be
the
reverse
on
the
same
terms
ailie
sat
down
undid
her
open
gown
and
her
lawn
handkerchief
round
her
neck
and
without
a
word
showed
me
her
right
breast
i
looked
at
and
examined
it
carefully
she
and
james
watching
me
and
rab
eying
all
three
what
could
i
say
there
it
was
that
had
once
been
so
soft
so
shapely
so
white
so
gracious
and
bountiful
so
full
of
all
blessed
conditions
hard
as
a
stone
a
centre
of
horrid
pain
making
that
pale
face
with
its
gray
lucid
reasonable
eyes
and
its
sweet
resolved
mouth
express
the
full
measure
of
suffering
overcome
why
was
that
gentle
modest
sweet
woman
clean
and
lovable
condemned
by
god
to
bear
such
a
burden
i
got
her
away
to
bed
may
rab
and
me
bide
said
james
you
may
and
rab
if
he
will
behave
himself
warrant
he
do
that
doctor
and
in
slunk
the
faithful
beast
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
him
there
are
no
such
dogs
now
he
belonged
to
a
lost
tribe
as
i
have
said
he
was
brindled
and
gray
like
rubislaw
granite
his
hair
short
hard
and
close
like
a
lion
his
body
like
a
little
bull
a
sort
of
compressed
hercules
of
a
dog
he
must
have
been
ninety
pounds
weight
at
the
least
he
had
a
large
blunt
head
his
muzzle
black
as
night
his
mouth
blacker
than
any
night
a
tooth
or
two
being
all
he
had
gleaming
out
of
his
jaws
of
darkness
his
head
was
scarred
with
the
records
of
old
wounds
a
sort
of
series
of
fields
of
battle
all
over
it
one
eye
out
one
ear
cropped
as
close
as
was
archbishop
leighton
father
the
remaining
eye
had
the
power
of
two
and
above
it
and
in
constant
communication
with
it
was
a
tattered
rag
of
an
ear
which
was
forever
unfurling
itself
like
an
old
flag
and
then
that
bud
of
a
tail
about
one
inch
long
if
it
could
in
any
sense
be
said
to
be
long
being
as
broad
as
long
the
mobility
the
instantaneousness
of
that
bud
were
very
funny
and
surprising
and
its
expressive
twinklings
and
winkings
the
intercommunications
between
the
eye
the
ear
and
it
were
of
the
oddest
and
swiftest
rab
had
the
dignity
and
simplicity
of
great
size
and
having
fought
his
way
all
along
the
road
to
absolute
supremacy
he
was
as
mighty
in
his
own
line
as
julius
caesar
or
the
duke
of
wellington
and
had
the
gravity
footnote
a
highland
when
asked
why
a
certain
terrier
of
singular
pluck
was
so
much
more
solemn
than
the
other
dogs
said
oh
sir
life
full
o
sairiousness
to
him
he
just
never
can
get
eneuch
fechtin
of
all
great
fighters
you
must
have
often
observed
the
likeness
of
certain
men
to
certain
animals
and
of
certain
dogs
to
men
now
i
never
looked
at
rab
without
thinking
of
the
great
baptist
preacher
andrew
fuller
footnote
fuller
was
in
early
life
when
a
farmer
lad
at
soham
famous
as
a
boxer
not
quarrelsome
but
not
without
the
stern
delight
a
man
of
strength
and
courage
feels
in
their
exercise
charles
stewart
of
dunearn
whose
rare
gifts
and
graces
as
a
physician
a
divine
a
scholar
and
a
gentleman
live
only
in
the
memory
of
those
few
who
knew
and
survive
him
liked
to
tell
how
fuller
used
to
say
that
when
he
was
in
the
pulpit
and
saw
a
buirdly
man
come
along
the
passage
he
would
instinctively
draw
himself
up
measure
his
imaginary
antagonist
and
forecast
how
he
would
deal
with
him
his
hands
meanwhile
condensing
into
fists
and
tending
to
square
he
must
have
been
a
hard
hitter
if
he
boxed
as
he
preached
what
the
fancy
would
call
an
ugly
customer
the
same
large
heavy
menacing
combative
sombre
honest
countenance
the
same
deep
inevitable
eye
the
same
look
as
of
thunder
asleep
but
ready
neither
a
dog
nor
a
man
to
be
trifled
with
next
day
my
master
the
surgeon
examined
ailie
there
was
no
doubt
it
must
kill
her
and
soon
it
could
be
removed
it
might
never
return
it
would
give
her
speedy
relief
she
should
have
it
done
she
courtesied
looked
at
james
and
said
when
said
the
kind
surgeon
a
man
of
few
words
she
and
james
and
rab
and
i
retired
i
noticed
that
he
and
she
spoke
little
but
seemed
to
anticipate
everything
in
each
other
the
following
day
at
noon
the
students
came
in
hurrying
up
the
great
stair
at
the
first
on
a
small
black
board
was
a
bit
of
paper
fastened
by
wafers
and
many
remains
of
old
wafers
beside
it
on
the
paper
were
the
words
an
operation
clerk
up
ran
the
youths
eager
to
secure
good
places
in
they
crowded
full
of
interest
and
talk
what
the
case
which
side
is
it
do
think
them
heartless
they
are
neither
better
nor
worse
than
you
or
i
they
get
over
their
professional
horrors
and
into
their
proper
work
and
in
them
pity
as
an
emotion
ending
in
itself
or
at
best
in
tears
and
a
breath
lessens
while
pity
as
a
motive
is
quickened
and
gains
power
and
purpose
it
is
well
for
poor
human
nature
that
it
is
so
the
operating
theatre
is
crowded
much
talk
and
fun
and
all
the
cordiality
and
stir
of
youth
the
surgeon
with
his
staff
of
assistants
is
there
in
comes
ailie
one
look
at
her
quiets
and
abates
the
eager
students
that
beautiful
old
woman
is
too
much
for
them
they
sit
down
and
are
dumb
and
gaze
at
her
these
rough
boys
feel
the
power
of
her
presence
she
walks
in
quickly
but
without
haste
dressed
in
her
mutch
her
neckerchief
her
white
dimity
her
black
bombazine
petticoat
showing
her
white
worsted
stockings
and
her
carpet
shoes
behind
her
was
james
with
rab
james
sat
down
in
the
distance
and
took
that
huge
and
noble
head
between
his
knees
rab
looked
perplexed
and
dangerous
forever
cocking
his
ear
and
dropping
it
as
fast
ailie
stepped
up
on
a
seat
and
laid
herself
on
the
table
as
her
friend
the
surgeon
told
her
arranged
herself
gave
a
rapid
look
at
james
shut
her
eyes
rested
herself
on
me
and
took
my
hand
the
operation
was
at
once
begun
it
was
necessarily
slow
and
chloroform
one
of
god
best
gifts
to
his
suffering
children
was
then
unknown
the
surgeon
did
his
work
the
pale
face
showed
its
pain
but
was
still
and
silent
soul
was
working
within
him
he
saw
that
something
strange
was
going
on
blood
flowing
from
his
mistress
and
she
suffering
his
ragged
ear
was
up
and
importunate
he
growled
and
gave
now
and
then
a
sharp
impatient
yelp
he
would
have
liked
to
have
done
something
to
that
man
but
james
had
him
firm
and
gave
him
a
glower
from
time
to
time
and
an
intimation
of
a
possible
kick
all
the
better
for
james
it
kept
his
eye
and
his
mind
off
ailie
it
is
over
she
is
dressed
steps
gently
and
decently
down
from
the
table
looks
for
james
then
turning
to
the
surgeon
and
the
students
she
courtesies
and
in
a
low
clear
voice
begs
their
pardon
if
she
has
behaved
ill
the
students
all
of
us
wept
like
children
the
surgeon
happed
her
up
carefully
and
resting
on
james
and
me
ailie
went
to
her
room
rab
following
we
put
her
to
bed
james
took
off
his
heavy
shoes
crammed
with
tackets
and
and
put
them
carefully
under
the
table
saying
maister
john
i
for
nane
o
yer
strynge
nurse
bodies
for
ailie
i
be
her
nurse
and
i
gang
aboot
on
my
stockin
soles
as
canny
as
pussy
and
so
he
did
and
handy
and
clever
and
swift
and
tender
as
any
woman
was
that
snell
peremptory
little
man
everything
she
got
he
gave
her
he
seldom
slept
and
often
i
saw
his
small
shrewd
eyes
out
of
the
darkness
fixed
on
her
as
before
they
spoke
little
rab
behaved
well
never
moving
showing
us
how
meek
and
gentle
he
could
be
and
occasionally
in
his
sleep
letting
us
know
that
he
was
demolishing
some
adversary
he
took
a
walk
with
me
every
day
generally
to
the
candlemaker
row
but
he
was
sombre
and
mild
declined
doing
battle
though
some
fit
cases
offered
and
indeed
submitted
to
sundry
indignities
and
was
always
very
ready
to
turn
and
came
faster
back
and
trotted
up
the
stair
with
much
lightness
and
went
straight
to
that
door
jess
the
mare
had
been
sent
with
her
cart
to
howgate
and
had
doubtless
her
own
dim
and
placid
meditations
and
confusions
on
the
absence
of
her
master
and
rab
and
her
unnatural
freedom
from
the
road
and
her
cart
for
some
days
ailie
did
well
the
wound
healed
by
the
first
intention
for
as
james
said
oor
ailie
skin
ower
clean
to
beil
the
students
came
in
quiet
and
anxious
and
surrounded
her
bed
she
said
she
liked
to
see
their
young
honest
faces
the
surgeon
dressed
her
and
spoke
to
her
in
his
own
short
kind
way
pitying
her
through
his
eyes
rab
and
james
outside
the
circle
rab
being
now
reconciled
and
even
cordial
and
having
made
up
his
mind
that
as
yet
nobody
required
worrying
but
as
you
may
suppose
semper
paratus
so
far
well
but
four
days
after
the
operation
my
patient
had
a
sudden
and
long
shivering
a
groosin
as
she
called
it
i
saw
her
soon
after
her
eyes
were
too
bright
her
cheek
colored
she
was
restless
and
ashamed
of
being
so
the
balance
was
lost
mischief
had
begun
on
looking
at
the
wound
a
blush
of
red
told
the
secret
her
pulse
was
rapid
her
breathing
anxious
and
quick
she
was
herself
as
she
said
and
was
vexed
at
her
restlessness
we
tried
what
we
could
james
did
everything
was
everywhere
never
in
the
way
never
out
of
it
rab
subsided
under
the
table
into
a
dark
place
and
was
motionless
all
but
his
eye
which
followed
every
one
ailie
got
worse
began
to
wander
in
her
mind
gently
was
more
demonstrative
in
her
ways
to
james
rapid
in
her
questions
and
sharp
at
times
he
was
vexed
and
said
she
was
never
that
way
afore
no
never
for
a
time
she
knew
her
head
was
wrong
and
was
always
asking
our
pardon
the
dear
gentle
old
woman
then
delirium
set
in
strong
without
pause
her
brain
gave
way
and
then
came
that
terrible
spectacle
the
intellectual
power
through
words
and
things
went
sounding
on
its
dim
and
perilous
way
she
sang
bits
of
old
songs
and
psalms
stopping
suddenly
mingling
the
psalms
of
david
and
the
diviner
words
of
his
son
and
lord
with
homely
odds
and
ends
and
scraps
of
ballads
nothing
more
touching
or
in
a
sense
more
strangely
beautiful
did
i
ever
witness
her
tremulous
rapid
affectionate
eager
scotch
voice
the
swift
aimless
bewildered
mind
the
baffled
utterance
the
bright
and
perilous
eye
some
wild
words
some
household
cares
something
for
james
the
names
of
the
dead
rab
called
rapidly
and
in
a
fremyt
voice
and
he
starting
up
surprised
and
slinking
off
as
if
he
were
to
blame
somehow
or
had
been
dreaming
he
heard
many
eager
questions
and
beseechings
which
james
and
i
could
make
nothing
of
and
on
which
she
seemed
to
set
her
all
and
then
sink
back
ununderstood
it
was
very
sad
but
better
than
many
things
that
are
not
called
sad
james
hovered
about
put
out
and
miserable
but
active
and
exact
as
ever
read
to
her
when
there
was
a
lull
short
bits
from
the
psalms
prose
and
metre
chanting
the
latter
in
his
own
rude
and
serious
way
showing
great
knowledge
of
the
fit
words
bearing
up
like
a
man
and
doting
over
her
as
his
ain
ailie
ailie
ma
woman
ma
ain
bonnie
wee
dawtie
the
end
was
drawing
on
the
golden
bowl
was
breaking
the
silver
cord
was
fast
being
loosed
that
animula
blandula
vagula
hospes
comesque
was
about
to
flee
the
body
and
the
soul
companions
for
sixty
years
were
being
sundered
and
taking
leave
she
was
walking
alone
through
the
valley
of
that
shadow
into
which
one
day
we
must
all
enter
and
yet
she
was
not
alone
for
we
know
whose
rod
and
staff
were
comforting
her
one
night
she
had
fallen
quiet
and
as
we
hoped
asleep
her
eyes
were
shut
we
put
down
the
gas
and
sat
watching
her
suddenly
she
sat
up
in
bed
and
taking
a
which
was
lying
on
it
rolled
up
she
held
it
eagerly
to
her
breast
to
the
right
side
we
could
see
her
eyes
bright
with
a
surprising
tenderness
and
joy
bending
over
this
bundle
of
clothes
she
held
it
as
a
woman
holds
her
sucking
child
opening
out
her
impatiently
and
holding
it
close
and
brooding
over
it
and
murmuring
foolish
little
words
as
over
one
whom
his
mother
comforteth
and
who
sucks
and
is
satisfied
it
was
pitiful
and
strange
to
see
her
wasted
dying
look
keen
and
yet
vague
her
immense
love
preserve
me
groaned
james
giving
way
and
then
she
rocked
backward
and
forward
as
if
to
make
it
sleep
hushing
it
and
wasting
on
it
her
infinite
fondness
wae
me
doctor
i
declare
she
thinkin
it
that
bairn
what
bairn
the
only
bairn
we
ever
had
our
wee
mysie
and
she
in
the
kingdom
forty
years
and
mair
it
was
plainly
true
the
pain
in
the
breast
telling
its
urgent
story
to
a
bewildered
ruined
brain
was
misread
and
mistaken
it
suggested
to
her
the
uneasiness
of
a
breast
full
of
milk
and
then
the
child
and
so
again
once
more
they
were
together
and
she
had
her
ain
wee
mysie
in
her
bosom
this
was
the
close
she
sank
rapidly
the
delirium
left
her
but
as
she
whispered
she
was
clean
silly
it
was
the
lightening
before
the
final
darkness
after
having
for
some
time
lain
still
her
eyes
shut
she
said
james
he
came
close
to
her
and
lifting
up
her
calm
clear
beautiful
eyes
she
gave
him
a
long
look
turned
to
me
kindly
but
shortly
looked
for
rab
but
could
not
see
him
then
turned
to
her
husband
again
as
if
she
would
never
leave
off
looking
shut
her
eyes
and
composed
herself
she
lay
for
some
time
breathing
quick
and
passed
away
so
gently
that
when
we
thought
she
was
gone
james
in
his
way
held
the
mirror
to
her
face
after
a
long
pause
one
small
spot
of
dimness
was
breathed
out
it
vanished
away
and
never
returned
leaving
the
blank
clear
darkness
without
a
stain
what
is
our
life
it
is
even
a
vapor
which
appeareth
for
a
little
time
and
then
vanisheth
away
rab
all
this
time
had
been
fully
awake
and
motionless
he
came
forward
beside
us
ailie
hand
which
james
had
held
was
hanging
down
it
was
soaked
with
his
tears
rab
licked
it
all
over
carefully
looked
at
her
and
returned
to
his
place
under
the
table
james
and
i
sat
i
do
know
how
long
but
for
some
time
saying
nothing
he
started
up
abruptly
and
with
some
noise
went
to
the
table
and
putting
his
right
fore
and
middle
fingers
each
into
a
shoe
pulled
them
out
and
put
them
on
breaking
one
of
the
leather
latchets
and
muttering
in
anger
i
never
did
the
like
o
that
afore
i
believe
he
never
did
nor
after
either
rab
he
said
roughly
and
pointing
with
his
thumb
to
the
bottom
of
the
bed
rab
leaped
up
and
settled
himself
his
head
and
eye
to
the
dead
face
maister
john
ye
wait
for
me
said
the
carrier
and
disappeared
in
the
darkness
thundering
downstairs
in
his
heavy
shoes
i
ran
to
a
front
window
there
he
was
already
round
the
house
and
out
at
the
gate
fleeing
like
a
shadow
i
was
afraid
about
him
and
yet
not
afraid
so
i
sat
down
beside
rab
and
being
wearied
fell
asleep
i
awoke
from
a
sudden
noise
outside
it
was
november
and
there
had
been
a
heavy
fall
of
snow
rab
was
in
statu
quo
he
heard
the
noise
too
and
plainly
knew
it
but
never
moved
i
looked
out
and
there
at
the
gate
in
the
dim
morning
for
the
sun
was
not
up
was
jess
and
the
cart
a
cloud
of
steam
rising
from
the
old
mare
i
did
not
see
james
he
was
already
at
the
door
and
came
up
the
stairs
and
met
me
it
was
less
than
three
hours
since
he
left
and
he
must
have
posted
out
who
knows
how
to
howgate
full
nine
miles
off
yoked
jess
and
driven
her
astonished
into
town
he
had
an
armful
of
blankets
and
was
streaming
with
perspiration
he
nodded
to
me
spread
out
on
the
floor
two
pairs
of
clean
old
blankets
having
at
their
corners
in
large
letters
in
red
worsted
these
were
the
initials
of
alison
graeme
and
james
may
have
looked
in
at
her
from
without
himself
unseen
but
not
unthought
of
when
he
was
wat
wat
and
weary
and
after
having
walked
many
a
mile
over
the
hills
may
have
seen
her
sitting
while
a
the
lave
were
sleepin
and
by
the
firelight
working
her
name
on
the
blankets
for
her
ain
james
bed
he
motioned
rab
down
and
taking
his
wife
in
his
arms
laid
her
in
the
blankets
and
happed
her
carefully
and
firmly
up
leaving
the
face
uncovered
and
then
lifting
her
he
nodded
again
sharply
to
me
and
with
a
resolved
but
utterly
miserable
face
strode
along
the
passage
and
followed
by
rab
i
followed
with
a
light
but
he
need
it
i
went
out
holding
stupidly
the
candle
in
my
hand
in
the
calm
frosty
air
we
were
soon
at
the
gate
i
could
have
helped
him
but
i
saw
he
was
not
to
be
meddled
with
and
he
was
strong
and
did
not
need
it
he
laid
her
down
as
tenderly
as
safely
as
he
had
lifted
her
out
ten
days
before
as
tenderly
as
when
he
had
her
first
in
his
arms
when
she
was
only
sorted
her
leaving
that
beautiful
sealed
face
open
to
the
heavens
and
then
taking
jess
by
the
head
he
moved
away
he
did
not
notice
me
neither
did
rab
who
presided
behind
the
cart
i
stood
till
they
passed
through
the
long
shadow
of
the
college
and
turned
up
nicolson
street
i
heard
the
solitary
cart
sound
through
the
streets
and
die
away
and
come
again
and
i
returned
thinking
of
that
company
going
up
libberton
brae
then
along
roslin
muir
the
morning
light
touching
the
pentlands
and
making
them
like
ghosts
then
down
the
hill
through
auchindinny
woods
past
haunted
woodhouselee
and
as
daybreak
came
sweeping
up
the
bleak
lammermuirs
and
fell
on
his
own
door
the
company
would
stop
and
james
would
take
the
key
and
lift
ailie
up
again
laying
her
on
her
own
bed
and
having
put
jess
up
would
return
with
rab
and
shut
the
door
james
buried
his
wife
with
his
neighbors
mourning
rab
watching
the
proceedings
from
a
distance
it
was
snow
and
that
black
ragged
hole
would
look
strange
in
the
midst
of
the
swelling
spotless
cushion
of
white
james
looked
after
everything
then
rather
suddenly
fell
ill
and
took
to
bed
was
insensible
when
the
doctor
came
and
soon
died
a
sort
of
low
fever
was
prevailing
in
the
village
and
his
want
of
sleep
his
exhaustion
and
his
misery
made
him
apt
to
take
it
the
grave
was
not
difficult
to
reopen
a
fresh
fall
of
snow
had
again
made
all
things
white
and
smooth
rab
once
more
looked
on
and
slunk
home
to
the
stable
and
what
of
rab
i
asked
for
him
next
week
at
the
new
carrier

the
of
james

of

ample
stomach

lay
half
asleep
at
the
door
in
the
sun
watching
the
solemnity
illustration
of
a
grave
