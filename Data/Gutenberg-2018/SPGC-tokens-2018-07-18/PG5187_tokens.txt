austere
countenance

opened
his
mouth
to
say
something

hesitated
slowly
he
untied
the
string
around
his
neck
and
laid
his
treasure
on
her
lap
then
without

up
he
ran
into
his

little
room
closing
the
door
behind
him
soon
afterward
miss
minerva
hearing
a
sound
like
a
stifled
sob
coming
from
the
adjoining
room
opened
the
door
softly
and
looked
into
a
sad
little
face
with
big
wide
open

shining
with
tears
what

matter
william

coldly

was
not
versed
in
the
ways
of
childhood
and
could
not
know
that
the
little
boy
wanted
to
pillow
his
head
on
aunt
cindy
soft
and
ample
bosom
that
he
was

shouting
she
remained
silent
an
i

wilkes

to
dance
a
clog
persisted
her
nephew
miss
minerva
still
remained
silent
she
felt
unable
to
cope
with
the
situation
till
she
had
adjusted
her
thoughts
and
made
her
plans
presently
billy
looking
at
her
shrewdly
said
gim

my
rabbit
foot
aunt
minerva
an
i
go
right
off
to
when
she
again
looked
in
on
him
he
was
fast
asleep
a
rosy
flush
on
his
babyish
tearstained
cheek
his
red
lips
half
parted
his
curly
head
pillowed
on
his
arm
and
close
against
his
soft
young
throat
there
nestled
the
left
hind
foot
of
a
rabbit
miss
minerva
bed
time
was
half
after
nine
summer
or
winter
she
had
hardly
varied
a
second
in
the
years
that
had
elapsed
since
the
runaway
marriage
of
her
only
relative
the
young
sister
whose
child
had
now
come
to
live
with
her
but
on
the
night
of
billy
arrival
the
stern
narrow
woman
sat
for
hours
in
her
rocking
chair
her
mind
busy
with
thoughts
of
that
pretty
young
sister
dead
since
the
boy
birth
and
now
the
wild
reckless
dissipated
was
dead
too
and
the
child
had
been
sent
to
her
to
the
aunt
who
did
not
want
him
who
did
not
care
for
children
who
had
never
forgiven
her
sister
her
unfortunate
marriage
if
he
had
only
been
a
girl
she
sighed
what
she
believed
to
be
a
happy
thought
entered
her
brain
i
shall
rear
him
she
promised
herself
just
as
if
he
were
a
little
girl
then
he
will
be
both
a
pleasure
and
a
comfort
to
me
and
a
companion
for
my
miss
minerva
was
strictly
methodical
she
worked
ever
by
the
clock
so
many
hours
for
this
so
many
minutes
for
that
william
she
now
resolved
for
the
first
time
becoming
really
interested
in
him
should
grow
up
to
be
a
model
young
man
a
splendid
and
wonderful
piece
of
mechanism
a
fine
practical
individual
moral
upright
religious
she
was
glad
that
he
was
young
she
would
begin
his
training
on
the
morrow
she
would
teach
him
to
sew
to
sweep
to
churn
to
cook
and
when
he
was
older
he
should
be
educated
for
the
ministry
yes
said
miss
minerva
i
shall
be
very
strict
with
him
just
at
first
and
punish
him
for
the
slightest
disobedience
or
misdemeanor
and
he
will
soon
learn
that
my
authority
is
not
to
be
and
the
little
boy
who
had
never
had
a
restraining
hand
laid
upon
him
in
his
short
life
he
slept
sweetly
and
innocently
in
the
next
room
dreaming
of
the
existence
on
the
plantation
and
of
his
idle
happy
negro
companions

idea
of

was
taken
from
the
severe
weekly
scrubbing
which
aunt
cindy
gave
him
with
a
hard
washrag
and
he
felt
that
he
rather
die
at

he
followed
his
aunt
dolefully
to
the
at
the
end
of
the
long
of
the
house
but
once
in
the
big
white

a
prim
old
maid
heart

water
had
curled
his
hair
into
riotous
yellow
ringlets
his
bright
eyes
gleamed
his
beautiful
expressive
little
face
shone
happily
and
every
movement
of
his
agile
lithe
figure
was
grace
itself
i
sho

he
remarked
as
he
took
his
seat
at
the
breakfast
table
miss
minerva
realized
that

the
time
to
begin
her
small
training

correctly

must
begin
at

william
she
said
sternly

not
talk

much
like

say

very
hungry

she
screamed
as

helped
himself
to
the
meat
and
gravy
leaving
a
little
brown
river
on
her
fresh
white
tablecloth
wait
until

his
proud

she
and
do

your
mouth
so
the
little
boy
flooded
his
plate
with
syrup
sho
is
he
began
but
instantly
remembering
that
he
must
be
more
particular
in
his
speech
he
stammered
out

she

correct
him
i
must
be
very
patient
she
thought
and
go
very
slowly
i
must
not
expect
too
much
of
him
at
after
breakfast
miss
minerva
who
would
not
keep
a
servant
preferring
to
do
her
own
work
tied
a
big
around
the
little
boy
neck
and
told
him
to
churn
while
she
washed
the
dishes
this
arrangement
did
not
suit
billy
boys

said
sullenly

an
i
agoing
to
major
minerva
he
ai
never

he
began
belligerently
but
his
relative
turned
an
uncompromising
and
rather
perturbed
back
upon
him
realizing
that
he
was
beaten
he
submitted
to
his
fate
clutched
the
dasher
angrily
and
began
his
weary
work
he
was
glad
his
little
black
friend
did
not
witness
his
disgrace
as
he
thought
of
wilkes
booth
lincoln
the
big
tears
came
into
his
eyes
and
rolled
down
his
cheeks
he
leaned
way
over
the
churn
and
the
great
glistening
tears
splashed
right
into
the
hole
made
for
the
dasher
and
rolled
into
the
milk
billy
grew
interested
at
once
and
laughed
aloud
he
puckered
up
his
face
and
tried
to
weep
again
for
he
wanted
more
tears
to
fall
into
the
churn
but
the
tears
refused
to
come
and
he
could
squeeze
another
one
out
of
his
eyes
aunt
minerva
he
said
mischievously
i

she
inquired

unsympathetically
he
grabbed
the
dasher
and
churned
vigorously
for
one
minute
i
reckon

butter

he
announced
resting
from
his
labors
it
has
begun
to
come
yet
replied
the
exasperated
woman
waste
so
much
time
the
child
churned
in
silence
for
the
space
of
two
minutes
and
suggested
it
time

she
it

butter
puffy
work

and
talk
less
again
there
was
a
brief
silence
broken
only
by
the
sound
of
the
dasher
thumping
against
the
bottom
of
the
churn
and
the
rattle
of
the
dishes
i

to

his
trumpet

was
under

quite
near
by
this
time

jimmy
as
he
turned
the
stream
of
water
full
upon
him
frances
lina

billy
clapped
their
hands
and
laughed
for
joy
with
a
terrified
and
angry
shriek
their
victim
dripping
water
at
every
step
ran
howling
by
his
tormentors
when
he
reached
a
safe
distance
he
turned
around
shook
a
fist
at
them
and
screamed
back

the
major
screamed
billy
delightedly
taking
the
hose
and
squaring
himself
to
greet
his
friend
of
the
train
but
jimmy
jerked
it
out
of
his
hand
before
either
of
them
noticed
him
turning
about
as
if
for
something
forgotten
you

the
sense
of

tadpole
billy

your

lina
gazed
up
the
street
that
looks
like
miss
minerva
to
me
up
yonder
she
remarked
i
think
we
had
better
get
away
from
here
before
she
sees
two
little
girls
rolling
two
doll
buggies
fairly
flew
down
the
street
and
one
little
boy
quickly
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
dividing
fence
from
this
safe
vantage
point
he
shouted
to
billy
who
was
holding
the
nozzle
of
the
hose
out
of
which
poured
a
stream
of
water
you
better
turn
that
water
off
miss
minerva
going
to
be
madder
a
green
i

said
billy
forlornly
you
turnt
it
drop
the
hose
and
run
to
the
hydrant
and
twist
that
little
thing
at
the
top
screamed
jimmy
you
all
time
got
to
perpose
someping
to
get
little
boys
in
trouble
anyway
he
added
ungenerously
you
perposed
this
declared
an
indignant
billy
you
said
aunt
minerva
so
she
would
git
christian
womans
can
get
just
as
mad
as
any
other
kind
declared
the
other
boy
sliding
from
his
perch
on
the
fence
and
running
across
his
lawn
to
disappear
behind
his
own
front
door
holding
her
skirts
nearly
up
to
her
knees
miss
minerva
stepped
gingerly
along
the
wet
and
muddy
street
till
she
got
to
her
gate
where
her
nephew
met
her
looking
a
little
guilty
but
still
holding
his
head
up
with
that
characteristic
manly
air
which
was
so
attractive
william
she
said
sternly
i
see
you
have
been
getting
into
mischief
and
i
feel
it
my
duty
to
punish
you
so
that
you
may
learn
to
be
trustworthy
i
said
nothing
to
you
about
the
hose
because
i
did
not
think
you
would
know
how
to
use
billy
remained
silent
he
did
not
want
to
betray
his
little
companions
of
the
morning
so
he
said
nothing
in
his
own
defense
come
with
me
into
the
house
continued
his
aunt
you
must
go
to
bed
at
but
the
child
protested
vigorously
don
make
me
go
to
bed
in
the
daytime
aunt
minerva
me
an
wilkes
booth
lincoln
ai
never
went
to
bed
in
the
daytime
since
we
born
an
i
ai
never
hear
tell
of
a
real
a
little
boy
in
bed
it
dark
an
i
ai
never
to
meddle
with
ole
hose
no
but
miss
minerva
was
obdurate
and
the
little
boy
spent
a
miserable
hour
between
the
sheets
chapter
vi
successful
strategy
i
have
a
present
for
you
said
his
aunt
handing
billy
a
long
rectangular
package
thank
you
said
her
beaming
nephew
as
he
sat
down
on
the
floor
all
eager
anticipation
and
began
to
untie
the
string
his
charming
changeful
face
was
bright
and
happy
again
but
his
expression
became
one
of
indignant
amaze
as
he
saw
the
contents
of
the
box
what
i
want
with
a
doll
he
asked
angrily
i
ai
no
i
think
every
little
boy
should
have
a
doll
and
learn
to
make
clothes
for
it
said
miss
minerva
i
do
want
you
to
be
a
great
rough
boy
i
want
you
to
be
sweet
and
gentle
like
a
little
girl
i
am
going
to
teach
you
how
to
sew
and
cook
and
sweep
so
you
may
grow
up
a
comfort
to
this
was
a
gloomy
forecast
for
the
little
boy
accustomed
as
he
had
been
to
the
freedom
of
a
big
plantation
and
he
scowled
darkly
me
an
wilkes
booth
lincoln
ai
never
hafter
play
with
no
dolls
sence
we
born
he
replied
sullenly

he
stopped
in
sudden
confusion
lina
and
frances
and
james
exclaimed
his
aunt
what
do
you
know
about
them
william
the
child
face
flushed
i
seen
this
mornin
he
acknowledged
miss
minerva
put
a
hand
on
either
shoulder
der
and
looked
straight
into
his
eyes
william
who
started
that
sprinkling
this
morning
she
questioned
sharply
billy
flushed
guiltily
and
lowered
his
eyelids
but
only
for
an
instant
quickly
recovering
his
composure
he
returned
her
gaze
steadily
and
ignored
her
question
i
see
yo
beau
too
aunt
minerva
he
remarked
tranquilly
it
was
miss
minerva
this
time
who
lost
her
composure
for
her
thin
sallow
face
became
perfectly
crimson
my
beau
she
asked
confusedly
who
put
that
nonsense
into
your
head
jimmy
show
him
to
me
he
replied
jauntily
once
more
master
of
the
situation
and
in
full
realization
of
the
fact
why
do
you
marry
him
aunt
minerva
so
he
could
live
right
here
with

an
i

churner

continued
flatteringly
an
dress
that

plumb
up
to
the
top
notch
i
sho
would
marry
him
if

billy
he

save
me
a
lot
of
steps
i
sho
would
like
to
hear
all
them
injuns
an
yankees
what
billy
aunt
was
visibly
embarrassed
the
persistent
admiration
of
this
her
one
lover
had
been
pleasing
to
her
yet
she
had
never
been
willing
to
sacrifice
her
independence
for
the
cares
and
trials
of
matrimony
the
existing
state
of
affairs
between
the
two
was
known
to
every
one
in
the
small
town
but
such
was
miss
minerva
dignified
aloofness
that
billy
was
the
first
person
who
had
ever
dared
to
broach
the
subject
to
her
sit
down
here
william
she
commanded
and
i
will
read
to
tell
me
a
tale
he
said
looking
up
at
her
with
his
bright
sweet
smile
the
doll
lay
neglected
on
a
chair
near
by
and
billy
wanted
her
to
forget
it
tell
me

there
was
an
interrogation
in
her
voice

but
did
nothin
come
up
but
jest
the
string
an
his
ole
she
died
all
the
strenk
done
gone
outer
that
miss
minerva
opened
a
book
called
gems
for
the
household
which
she
had
purchased
from
a
silvertongued
she
selected
an
article
the
subject
of
which
was
the
pure
in
billy
listened
with
a
seemingly
attentive
ear
to
the
choice
flow
of
words
but
in
reality
his
little
brain
was
busy
with
its
own
thoughts
the
article
closed
with
the
suggestion
that
if
one
were
innocent
and
pure
he
would
have
a
dreamless
sleep
if
you
have
a
conscience
clear
and
god
commands
you
keep
if
your
heart
is
good
and
pure
you
will
have
a
perfect
billy
aunt
concluded
wishing
to
know
if
he
had
understood
what
she
had
just
read
she
asked
what
people
sleep
the
soundest
niggers
was
his
prompt
reply
as
he
thought
of
the
long
summer
days
and
the
colored
folk
on
the
plantation
she
was
disappointed
but
not
discouraged
now
william
she
admonished
i
going
to
read
you
another
piece
and
i
want
you
to
tell
me
about
it
when
i
get
through
pay
strict
yas
he
readily
agreed
she
chose
an
article
describing
the
keen
sense
of
smell
in
animals
miss
minerva
was
not
an
entertaining
reader
and
the
words
were
long
and
fairly
incomprehensible
to
the
little
boy
sitting
patiently
at
her
side
again
his
thoughts
wandered
though
every
now
and
then
he
caught
a
word
or
two
what
animals
have
the
keenest
sense
of
smell
william
was
her
query
at
the
conclusion
of
her
reading
billy
goats
was
billy
answer
without
the
slightest
hesitation
you
have
goats
on
the
brain
she
said
in
anger
i
did
not
read
one
word
about
billy
well
if

billy

he
replied
i
do
know
what

kinswoman

with

chubby
legs
through
the
aperture

fat
little
middle
for
an
instant
and

much
panting
and
tugging
wriggled
his
plump
round
body

he
walked
over
where
a
lonesome
looking
hen
was
sitting
patiently
on

billy
climbed
up

little
body

opening

dexterously
caught
the
hen
by
the
nape
of
the
neck
as
he
had
seen

hole
and
stood
on

outside
waiting
cap
in
hand
to
receive
them
but
the
patient
hen
had
at
last
raised
her
voice
in
angry
protest
and
set
up
a
furious
cackling
which
so
frightened
the
little
boy
on
the
inside
that
he
was
he
caught
hold
of
a
low
roost
pole
swung
himself
up
and
wholly
unmindful
of
his
blouse
full
of
eggs
pushed
his
lower
limbs
through
the
hole
and
stuck
fast
a
pair
of
chubby
sturdy
legs
down
which
were
slowly
trickling
little
yellow
rivulets
and
half
of
a
plump
round
body

rightful
exit
finding
it
stopped
up
by
a
wriggling
squirming
body

perched

her
enraged
wings

the
window
and
she

her
lover
holding
a
rope
ladder
in

see
ef

like
giggling
mightily
they
jumped
the
dividing
fence
and
slipped
with
stealthy
tread
around
the
house
to
sarah
jane
cabin
in
the
bennie
dick
was
sitting
on
the
floor
before
the
open
door
the
entrance
of
which
was
securely
barricaded
to
keep
him
inside
sarah
jane
was
in
the
kitchen
cooking
supper
they
could
hear
her
happy
voice
raised
in
religious
melody
garner
had
not
yet
returned
from
a
card
party
the
coast
was
clear
and
the
time
propitious
jimmy
tiptoed
to
the
house
and
soon
returned
with
a
big
bottle
of
a
powerful
blondine
in
one
hand
and
a
stick
of
candy
in
the
other
bennie
dick
he
said
here
a
nice
stick
of
candy

if

the
negro

thick
red
lips
curved
in
a
grin
of
delight
his
shiny
ebony
face
beamed
happily
his
round
black
eyes
sparkled
as
he
held
out
his
fat
rusty
little
hands
he
sucked
greedily
at
the
candy
as
the
two
mischievous
little
boys
uncorked
the
bottle
and
poured
a
generous
supply
of
the
liquid
on
his
head
they
rubbed
it
in
well
grinning
with
delight
they
made
a
second
and
a
third
application
before
the
bottle
was
exhausted
then
they
stood
off
to
view
the
result
of
their
efforts
the
effect
was
ludicrous
the
combination
of
coal
black
skin
and
red
gold
hair
presented
by
the
little
negro
exceeded
the
wildest
expectations
of
jimmy
and
billy
they
shrieked
with
laughter
and
rolled
over
and
over
on
the

had
a
difference
with
billy
and
was
in
the
sulks
on
his
own
side
of
the
fence
immediately
crawled
over
and
joined
the
others
in
the
swing
he
was
lonesome
and
the
prospect
of
companionship
was
too
alluring
for
him
to
nurse
his
anger

billy
she
commanded
the
children
ran
breathlessly
to
their
homes
nearby
and
collected
the
different
articles
necessary
to
transform
them
into
presentable
indians
they
soon
returned
jimmy
dumping
his
load
over
the
fence
and
tumbling
after
and
the
happy
quartette
sat
down
on
the
grass
in
miss
yard
first
the
paint
boxes
were
opened
and
generously
shared
with
billy
as
with
their
handkerchiefs
they
spread
thick
layers
of
rouge
over
their
charming
bright
mischievous
little
faces
the
feather
decoration
was
next
in
order
how
we
goin
to
make
these
feathers
stick
asked
billy
they
were
in
a
dilemma
till
the
resourceful
jimmy
came
to
the
rescue
wait
a
minute
he
cried
i
be
back
you
can
say
he
rolled
over
the
fence
and
was
back
in
a
few
minutes
gleefully
holding
up
a
bottle
this
make
stick
he
panted
almost
out
of
breath
lina
assumed
charge
of
the
she
took
billy
first
rubbed
the
mucilage
well
into
his
sunny
curls
and
filled
his
head
full
of
his
aunt
turkey
feathers
leaving
them
to
stick
out
awkwardly
in
all
directions
and
at
all
angles
jimmy
and
frances
after
robbing
their
mothers
dusters
were
similarly
decorated
and
last
lina
herself
was
tastefully
arrayed
by
the
combined
efforts
of
the
other
three
at
last
all
was
in
readiness
billy
regardless
of
consequences
had
pinned
his
aunt
newest
grey
blanket
around
him
and
was
viewing
with
satisfied
admiration
its
long
length
trailing
on
behind
him
lina
had
her
mother
treasured
navajo
blanket
draped
around
her
graceful
little
figure
frances
after
pulling
the
covers
off
of
several
beds
and
finding
nothing
to
suit
her
fanciful
taste
had
snatched
a
gorgeous
silk
afghan
from
the
leather
couch
in
the
library
it
was
an
expensive
affair
of
intricate
pattern
delicate
stitches
and
beautiful
embroidery
with
a
purple
velvet
border
and
a
yellow
satin
lining
she
had
dragged
one
corner
of
it
through
the
mud
puddle
and
torn
a
big
rent
in
another
place
jimmy
was
glorious
in
a
bright
red
blanket
carrying
his
little
bow
and
arrow
i

the
discussion

lina
he
anxiously
inquired

indian

said
lina
going
to
the
swing
where
the
dolls
had
been
left
billy
pulled
a
piece
of
string
from
his
pocket
and
the
babies
were
safely
strapped
to
their
mothers
backs
with
stately
tread
headed
by
sitting
steer
the
children
marched
back
and
forth
across
the
lawn
in
indian
file
so
absorbed
were
they
in
playing
indian
that
they
forgot
the
flight
of
time
until
their
chief
suddenly
stopped
all
his
brave
valor
gone
as
he
pointed
with
trembling
finger
up
the
street
that
part
of
the
ladies
aid
society
which
lived
in
west
covington
was
bearing
down
upon
them

our

a
heap
of
it

some
hours
later
billy
aunt
had
ruthlessly
clipped
the
turkey
feathers
from
his
head
taking
the
hair
off
in
great
patches
she
had
then
boiled
his
scalp
so
the
little
boy
thought
in
her
efforts
to
remove
the
mucilage
now
shorn
of
his
locks
and
of
some
of
his
courage
the
child
was
sitting
quietly
by
her
side
listening
to
a
superior
moral
lecture
and
indulging
in
a
compulsory
talk
with
his
relative
i

chapter
xii
in
the
house
of
the
lord
it
was
a
beautiful
sunday
morning
the
pulpit
of
the
methodist
church
was
not
occupied
by
its
regular
pastor
brother
johnson
instead
a
traveling
minister
collecting
funds
for
a
church
orphanage
in
memphis
was
the
speaker
for
the
day
miss
minerva
rarely
missed
a
service
in
her
own
church
she
was
always
on
hand
at
the
love
feast
and
the
missionary
rally
and
gave
liberally
of
her
means
to
every
cause
she
was
sitting
in
her
own
pew
between
billy
and
jimmy
and
garner
having
remained
at
home
across
the
aisle
from
her
sat
frances
black
between
her
father
and
mother
two
pews
in
front
of
her
were
and
hamilton
with
lina
on
the
outside
next
the
aisle
the
good
major
was
there
too
it
was
the
only
place
he
could
depend
upon
for
seeing
miss
minerva
the
preacher
after
an
earnest
and
eloquent
discourse
from
the
text
he
will
remember
the
fatherless
closed
the
big
bible
with
a
bang
calculated
to
wake
any
who
might
be
sleeping
he
came
down
from
the
pulpit
and
stood
close
to
his
hearers
as
he
made
his
last
pathetic
appeal
my
own
heart
said
he
goes
out
to
every
orphan
child
for
in
the
yellow
fever
epidemic
of
when
but
two
years
old
i
lost
both
father
and
mother
if
there
are
any
little
orphan
children
here
i
should
be
glad
if
they
would
come
up
to
the
front
and
shake
hands
with
now
miss
minerva
always
faithfully
responded
to
every
proposal
made
by
a
preacher
it
was
a
part
of
her
religious
conviction
at
revivals
she
was
ever
a
shining
if
solemn
and
austere
light
when
a
minister
called
for
all
those
who
wanted
to
go
to
heaven
to
rise
she
was
always
the
first
one
on
her
feet
if
he
asked
to
see
the
raised
hands
of
those
who
were
members
of
the
church
at
the
tender
age
of
ten
years
miss
thin
long
arm
gave
a
prompt
response
once
when
a
celebrated
evangelist
was
holding
a
big
protracted
meeting
under
canvas
in
the
town
and
had
asked
all
those
who
had
read
the
book
of
hezekiah
in
the
bible
to
stand
up
miss
minerva
on
one
side
of
the
big
tent
and
her
devoted
lover
on
the
other
side
were
among
the
few
who
had
risen
to
their
feet
she
had
read
the
good
book
from
cover
to
cover
from
genesis
to
revelation
over
and
over
so
she
thought
she
had
read
hezekiah
a
score
of
times
so
now
when
the
preacher
called
for
little
orphans
to
come
forward
she
leaned
down
and
whispered
to
her
nephew
go
up
to
the
front
william
and
shake
hands
with
the
nice
kind
wha
fer
he
asked
i
don
want
to
go
up
there
here
look
right
at
are
there
no
little
orphans
here
the
minister
was
saying
i
want
to
shake
the
hand
of
any
little
child
who
has
had
the
misfortune
to
lose
its
go
on
william
commanded
his
aunt
go
shake
hands
with
the
the
little
boy
again
demurred
but
miss
minerva
insisting
he
obediently
slipped
by
her
and
by
his
chum
walking
gracefully
and
jauntily
up
the
aisle
to
the
spot
where
the
lecturer
was
standing
by
a
broad
table
he
held
out
his
slim
little
hand
jimmy
looked
at
these
proceedings
of
billy
in
astonishment
not
comprehending
at
all
he
was
rather
indignant
that
the
older
boy
had
not
confided
in
him
and
invited
his
participation
but
jimmy
was
not
the
one
to
sit
calmly
by
and
be
ignored
when
there
was
anything
doing
so
he
slid
awkwardly
from
the
bench
before
miss
minerva
knew
what
he
was
up
to
signaling
frances
to
follow
he
swaggered
pompously
behind
billy
and
he
too
held
out
a
short
fat
hand
to
the
minister
the
speaker
smiled
benignly
down
upon
them
lifting
them
up
in
his
arms
he
stood
the
little
boys
upon
the
table
he
thought
the
touching
sight
of
these
innocent
and
tender
little
orphans
would
empty
the
pockets
of
the
audience
billy
turned
red
with
embarrassment
at
his
conspicuous
position
while
jimmy
grinned
happily
at
the
amused
congregation
horrified
miss
minerva
half
rose
to
her
feet
but
decided
to
remain
where
she
was
she
was
a
timid
woman
and
did
not
know
what
course
she
ought
to
pursue
besides
she
had
just
caught
the
major
smile
and
how
long
have
you
been
an
orphan
the
preacher
was
asking
of
billy
ever
sence
me
an
wilkes
booth
lincoln
born
sweetly
responded
the
child
i
the
orphantest
boy
they
is
volunteered
jimmy
frances
responding
to
the
latter
invitation
had
crawled
over
her
father
legs
before
he
realized
what
was
happening
she
too
went
sailing
down
the
aisle
her
stiff
white
dress
standing
straight
up
in
the
back
like
a
strutting
gobbler
tail
she
grabbed
hold
of
the
hand
and
was
promptly
lifted
to
the
table
beside
the
other
tears
stood
in
the
good
preacher
eyes
as
he
turned
to
the
tittering
audience
and
said
in
a
pathetic
voice
think
of
it
my
friends
this
beautiful
little
girl
has
no
poor
black
a
hundred
pairs
of
eyes
sought
her
pew
and
focused
themselves
upon
the
pretty
young
woman
sitting
there
red
angry
and
shamefaced
black
was
visibly
amused
and
could
hardly
keep
from
laughing
aloud
as
frances
passed
by
the
hamiltons
pew
in
her
promenade
down
the
aisle
hamilton
leaned
across
her
husband
and
made
an
attempt
to
clutch
lina
but
she
was
too
late
already
that
dignified
little
orphan
was
gliding
with
stately
conscious
tread
to
join
the
others
this
was
too
much
for
the
audience
a
few
boys
laughed
out
and
for
the
first
time
the
preacher
suspicions
were
aroused
as
he
clasped
lina
slender
graceful
little
hand
he
asked
and
you
have
no
father
or
mother
little
girl
yes
i
have
too
she
angrily
retorted
my
father
and
mother
are
sitting
right
there
and
she
pointed
a
slim
forefinger
to
her
crimson
embarrassed
parents

billy
the
children
swung
awhile
in
silence
presently
jimmy
broke
the
quiet
by
remarking

interrupted

that

yuther
kin
o
skeercrows
billy
strolled
to
the
other
side
of
the
big
yard
and
climbed
up
and
sat
on
the
tall
gate
post
a
stranger
coming
from
the
opposite
direction
stopped
and
spoke
to
him
does
john
smith
live
here
he
asked
naw
sir
was
the
reply
do
no
live
here
jest
me
aunt
minerva
an
she
turns
up
her
nose
at
anything
that
wears
and
where
could
i
find
your
aunt
minerva
the
stranger
grin
was
ingratiating
and
agreeable
why
this
here
monday
the
little
boy
exclaimed
of
course
she
at
the
aid
all
the
roun
here
goes
to
the
aid
on
your
aunt
is
an
old
friend
of
mine
went
on
the
man
and
i
knew
she
was
at
the
aid
i
just
wanted
to
find
out
if
you
tell
the
truth
about
her
some
little
boys
tell
stories
but
i
am
glad
to
find
out
you
are
so
truthful
my
name
is
algernon
jones
and
i
glad
to
know
you
shake
put
it
there
partner
and
the
fascinating
stranger
held
out
a
grimy
paw
billy
smiled
down
from
his
perch
at
him
and
thought
he
had
never
met
such
a
pleasant
man
if
he
was
such
an
old
friend
of
his
aunt
maybe
she
would
not
object
to
him
because
he
wore
pants
he
thought
maybe
she
might
be
persuaded
to
take
jones
for
a
husband
billy
almost
hoped
that
she
would
hurry
home
from
the
aid
he
wanted
to
see
the
two
together
so
is
you
much
of
a
cusser
he
asked
solemnly
if
you
is
hafter
cut
it
out
on
these
jones
seemed
much
surprised
and
hurt
at
the
question
an
oath
never
passed
these
lips
replied
the
truthful
gentleman
can
you
churn
churn
churn
with
a
reminiscent
smile
i
can
churn
like
a
jimmy
was
dying
of
curiosity
but
the
gate
was
too
far
away
for
him
to
do
more
than
catch
a
word
now
and
then
it
was
also
out
of
sarah
visual
line
so
she
knew
nothing
of
the
stranger
advent
and
you
here
all
by
yourself
insinuated
billy
new
friend
and
the
folks
next
door
where
are
they
mrs
garner
at
the
aid
an
garner
gone
to
memphis

he
led
the
agreeable
plumber
through
the
hall
down
the
long
to
the
bathroom
remarking
i
jes
watch
you
and
he
seated
himself
in
the
only
chair
here
is
where
billy
received
one
of
the
greatest
surprises
of
his
life
the
fascinating
stranger
grabbed
him
with
a
rough
hand
and
hissed
do
you
dare
open
your
mouth
or
i
crack
your
head
open
and
scatter
your
brains
i
eat
you
the
fierce
bloodshot
eyes
which
had
seemed
so
laughing
and
merry
before
now
glared
into
those
of
the
little
boy
as
the
man
took
a
stout
cord
from
his
pocket
bound
billy
to
the
chair
and
gagged
him
with
a
large
bath
towel
energetic
jones
took
the
key
out
of
the
door
shook
his
fist
at
the
child
went
out
and
locked
the
door
behind
him
jimmy
seeing
no
hope
of
eluding
sarah
jane
vigilance
resorted
to
strategy
and
deceit
no
fun
setting
out
here
he
called
to
her
so
i
going
in
the
house
and
take
a
she
willingly
consented
as
she
was
through
with
her
ironing
and
thought
to
snatch
a
few
winks
of
sleep
herself
the
little
boy
slipped
quietly
through
the
house
noiselessly
across
the
and
into
his
father
big
garden
which
was
separated
from
that
of
his
neighbor
by
a
high
he
quickly
climbed
the
fence
flew
across
miss
minerva
tomato
patch
and
tiptoed
up
her
back
steps
to
the
back
porch
his
little
bare
feet
giving
no
sign
of
his
presence
hearing
curious
noises
coming
from
the
where
billy
was
bumping
the
chair
up
and
down
in
his
efforts
to
release
his
mouth
he
made
for
that
spot
promptly
unlocked
the
door
and
walked
in
billy
by
scuffling
and
tugging
had
freed
his
mouth
from
the
towel
that
bound
it
at
that
moment
hush
he
whispered
as
jimmy
opened
the
door
you
get
eat
up
alive
if
you
do
look
his
tone
was
so
mysterious
and
thrilling
and
he
looked
so
scared
tied
to
the
chair
that
the
younger
boy
blood
almost
froze
in
his
veins
what
you
doing
all
tied
up
so
he
asked
in
low
frightened
tones

algernon

the
garden
route
and
in

the
telephone
with
the
receiver
at
his
ear

but
he

a
office
over
my
papa
his
father

the
little
boy
shrewdly
decided
that
miss
minerva
beau

the
next
best
man
to
help
capture
the
robber
miss
minerva
what
lives
by
me
he
shrieked
fortunately
central
recognized
his
childish
voice
and
was
willing
to
humor
him
so
as
she

knew
miss
minerva
beau
the
connection
was
quickly
made

he
the

to
a
chair
and
done
eat
up
a
million
cold
biscuits
i
spec
all
of
us

slewed
the
plump
round
gentleman
at
the
other
end
of
the
wire
heard
this
amazing
message
in
the
utmost
confusion
and
consternation
he
frantically
rang
the
telephone
again
and
again
but
could
get
no
answer
from
the
garners
home
so
he
put
on
his
hat
and
walked
the
short
distance
to
miss
minerva
house
jimmy
was
waiting
to
receive
him
at
the
front
gate
having
again
eluded

he
whispered
mysteriously

in
the
ai

come
algernon
jones
feeling
safe
and
secure
for
the
next
hour
and
having
partaken
of
a
light
lunch
was
in
the
act
of
transferring
some
silver
spoons
from
the
sideboard
to
his
pockets
when
a
noise
at
the
door
caused
him
to
look
in
that
direction
with
an
oath
he
sprang
forward
and
landed
his
fist
upon
the
nose
of
a
plump
gentleman
standing
there
bringing
a
stream
of
blood
and
sending
him
sprawling
to
the
floor
jones
overturned
a
little
boy
who
was
in
his
way
and
walking
rapidly
in
the
direction
of
the
railroad
the
erstwhile
plumber
was
seen
no
more
jimmy
quickly
recovered
himself
and
sprang
to
his
feet
seeing
the
blood
streaming
down
the
white
shirt
front
of
miss
minerva
unconscious
beau
he
gathered
his
wits
together
and
took
the
thread
of
events
again
into
his
own
little
hands
he
flung
himself
over
the
fence
careless
of
sarah
jane
this
time
mounted
a
chair
and
once
more

crazy
message
in
astonishment
he

rang
the

he
walked
down
to

house
and
rang
the
jimmy

and
led

to
the
where

billy
shut
up
in
the
and
listening
to
all
the
noise
and
confusion

been
scared
nearly
out
of
his
senses

had
kept
as
still
as

friendly
voices

yelled

the
cords

chapter

billy
the
credulous
after
the
advent
and
disappearance
of
the
exciting
jones
miss
minerva
much
to
billy
joy
had
a
telephone
put
in
the
house
he
sat
in
the
hall
the
day
it
was
put
in
waiting
for
it
to
ring
jimmy
coming
up
on
the
front
porch
and
through
the
door
and
seeing
him
sitting
there
rang
the
door
bell
just
for
a
joke
ready
to
burst
into
a
laugh
when
the
other
little
boy
turned
around
and
saw
who
it
was
billy
however
in
his
eagerness
mistook
the
ring
for
the
telephone
bell
and
joyfully
climbed
up
on
the
chair
which
he
had
stationed
in
readiness
he
took
down
the
receiver
as
he
had
seen
jimmy
do
in
his
home
and
without
once
seeing
that
little
boy
standing
a
few
feet
from
him
he
yelled
at
the
top
of
his
lungs
hello
who
is
that
this
is
marie
yarbrough
replied
jimmy
from
the
doorway
instantly
recognizing
billy
mistake
marie
yarbrough
was
a
little
girl
much
admired
by
the
two
boys
as
she
had
a
pony
and
cart
of
her
very
own
however
she
lived
in
a
different
part
of
the
town
and
attended
another
so
they
had
no
speaking
acquaintance
with
her
i
jus
wanted
to
talk
to
you
went
on
the
counterfeit
marie
stifling
a
laugh
and
trying
to
talk
like
a
girl
i
think
you
the
sweetest
little
boy
they
is
and
i
want
you

you
a
plumb
billy
came
from
the
doorway
so
you
howled
back
the
delighted
and
flattered
billy
jimmy
thought
he
would
pop
wide
open
in
his
efforts
to
keep
from
laughing
how
you
like
to
be
my
sweetheart
he
asked
i
already

the
loud

said
a
giggling
jimmy
all
right
i
going
to
ask
aunt
minerva
to
lem
me
go

we
take
jimmy
too
this
was
too
much
for
the
little
boy
he
had
held
himself
in
as
long
as
possible
he
burst
into
a
peal
of
laughter
so
merry
and
so
loud
that
billy
turning
quickly
almost
fell
out
of
the
chair
what
you
doin
to
me
talk
to
marie
yarbrough
the
telephone
he
questioned
angrily
marie
your
pig
foot
was
the
inelegant
response
that
was
just
me
to
you
all
the
time
you
all
time
think
you
talking
to
little
girls
and
all
time
nobody
but
a
light
dawned
upon
the
innocent
one
he
promptly
hung
up
the
receiver
and
got
down
out
of
the
chair
before
jimmy
was
fully
aware
of
his
intention
billy
had
thrown
him
to
the
floor
and
was
giving
him
a
good
pommeling

growled
from

replied
the
tormented

miss

accepted
his
compromise
and
jimmy
flattened
stomach
relieved
of
its
burden
puffed
out
to
its
usual
roundness
as
that
little
boy
rose
to
his
feet
saying
sam
lamb
would
died
billy
if
he
seen
you
he
better
never
hear
tell
of
it
was
the
threatening
rejoinder
chapter
xvi
the
humble
petition
billy
sitting
in
an
old
buggy
in
front
of
the
livery
stable
had
just
engaged
in
a
long
and
interesting
conversation
with
sam
lamb
he
was
getting
out
of
the
vehicle
when
the
sharp
wire
around
a
broken
rod
caught
in
the
back
of
his
trousers
and
tore
a
great
hole
he
felt
a
tingling
pain
and
looked
over
his
shoulder
to
investigate
not
being
satisfied
with
the
result
he
turned
his
back
to
the
negro
and
anxiously
enquired

back

close
examination

his
discouraging
decision
and
hit
ter
me
dat

the
child
sighed
the
injury
to
the
flesh

of
small
importance
he
could
hide
that
from
his
aunt
but
the
rent

a
serious
matter

my
again
he
turned
his
back
to
his
friend
and
his
clouded
little
face
looking
over
his
shoulder
he
asked
do
my
meat
show
sam
she

visible
ter
the
naked
eye
and
sam
lamb
laughed
loudly
at
his
own
wit

the
little
boy
dolefully

the
child

no
second

he
fairly
flew
sam
wife
was
cooking
but
she
cheerfully
stopped
her
work
to
help
the
little
boy
she
sewed
up
his
union
suit
and
put
a
bright
blue
patch
on
his
brown
linen
breeches
billy
felt
a
little
more
cheerful
though
he
still
dreaded
confessing
to
his
aunt
and
he
loitered
along
the
way
till
it
was
nearly
dark
supper
was
ready
when
he
got
home
and
he
walked
into
the
diningroom
with
his
customary
ease
and
grace
but
he
took
his
seat
uneasily
and
he
was
so
quiet
during
the
meal
and
ate
so
little
that
his
aunt
asked
him
if
he
were
sick
he
was
planning
in
his
mind
how
to
break
the
news
of
the
day
disaster
to
her
you
are
improving
william
she
remarked
presently
you
have
got
into
any
mischief
you
have
been
a
mighty
good
little
boy
now
for
two
billy
flushed
at
the
compliment
and
shifted
uneasily
in
his
seat
that
patch
seemed
to
burn
him
if
god
jest
do
his
part
he
said
darkly
i
would
never
git
in
no
after
supper
miss
minerva
washed
the
dishes
in
the
kitchen
sink
and
billy
carried
them
back
to
the
his
aunt
caught
him
several
times
prancing
sideways
in
the
most
idiotic
manner
he
was
making
a
valiant
effort
to
keep
from
exposing
his
rear
elevation
to
her
once
he
had
to
walk
backward
william
she
said
sharply
you
will
break
my
plates
what
is
the
matter
with
you
a
little
later
they
were
sitting
quietly
in
miss
minerva
room
she
was
reading
the
christian
at
home
and
he
was
absently
looking
at
a
picture
book
sam
lamb
wife
sukey
sho
is
a
beautiful
patcher
he
remarked
feeling
his
way
she
made
no
answering
comment
and
the
discouraged
little
boy
was
silent
for
a
few
minutes
he
had
worn
aunt
cindy
patches
too
often
to
be
ashamed
of
this
one
for
himself
but
he
felt
that
he
would
like
to
draw
his
aunt
out
and
find
how
she
stood
on
the
subject
of
patches
aunt
minerva
he
presently
asked
what
sorter
patches
you
ruther
wear
on
yo
pants
blue
patches
or
brown
on
my
what
she
asked
looking
at
him
severely
over
her
paper
i
mean
if
you
me
he
hastily
explained
do
you
think
blue
patches
is
the
mos
lookin
what
are
you
driving
at
william
she
asked
but
without
waiting
for
his
answer
she
went
on
with
her
reading
the
child
was
silent
for
a
long
time
his
little
mind
busy
then
he
began
aunt
minerva
she
peered
at
him
over
her
glasses
a
second
then
dropped
her
eyes
to
the
paper
where
an
interesting
article
on
foreign
missions
held
her
attention
aunt
minerva
i
snagged
aunt
minerva
i
snagged
my
my
skin

place
she
said
absently
her
eyes
glued
to
a
paragraph
describing
a
cannibal
feast
i
on
it
right
now
he
replied
another
long
silence
ensued
billy
resolved
to
settle
the
matter
i
gettin
sleepy
he
yawned
aunt
minerva
i
wants
to
say
my
prayers
and
go
to
she
laid
her
paper
down
and
he
dropped
to
his
knees
by
her
side
he
usually
sprawled
all
over
her
lap
during
his
lengthy
devotions
but
he
clasped
his
little
hands
and
reared
back
like
a
rabbit
on
its
haunches
after
he
had
rapidly
repeated
the
lord
prayer
which
he
had
recently
learned
and
had
invoked
blessings
on
all
his
new
friends
and
old
ones
he
concluded
with

eye
his
little
form
was
drawn
to
its
full
proud
height

soft
fair

billy
taking
down

and
trying

he
said
i
berlieve
it

ready
suggestion
he
stood
behind
billy
and
they
put
the
stays
around
both
little
bodies
while
with
much
squeezing
and
giggling
billy
hooked
them
safely
up
the
front
the
boys
got
in
front
of
sarah
jane
one
and
danced
about
laughing
with
glee
we
like
the
twinses

declared
the
younger
child
presently
they
began
to

uncomfortable
especially

fat
round
little
middle

tightly
compressed
here

billy
and
le

billy
said
jimmy
put
his
short
fat
arms
around
him
and
tried
his
hand
but
with
no
better
success
the
stays
were
such
a
snug
fit
that
the
hooks
seemed
glued
we

fix
said
billy
gloomily

in

with
rising
passion

he
backed
the
other
child
close
to
the
wall
and
pressed
so
hard
against
him
that
jimmy
screamed
aloud
and
began
to
pound
him
on
the
head
with
his
chubby
fists
billy
would
not
submit
tamely
to
any
such
treatment
he
reached
his
hand
behind
him
and
gave
the
smaller
boy
cheek
a
merciless
pinch
the
fight
was
on
the
two
little
boys
laced
up
tightly
as
they
were
in
a
stout
pair
of
stays
pinched
and
scratched
and
kicked
and
jerked
suddenly
billy
leaning
heavily
against
jimmy
threw
him
flat
on
his
back
and
fell
on

of
him
bennie

on
the
floor

up
to
this
time

an
interested
eye

being
committed
he
opened
his
big
red
mouth
and
emitted
a
howl
that
could
be
heard
half
a
mile
it
immediately
brought
his
mother
to
the
open
door
when

the
long
length
of
the

the
fresh
sticky
paint

asked
frances
looking
gloomily
down
at
her
feet
which
seemed
to
be
encased
in
green
moccasins
at
that
moment
she
slipped
and
fell
sprawling
on
top
of
the
roof
when
the
others
helped
her
to
her
feet
she
was
a
sight
to
behold
her
white
dress
splotched
with
vivid
green
from
top
to
bottom
if

while

were
talking
the
owner
of
the
ladder
who
had
not
noticed
them
and
was
deaf
in
the
bargain
had
quietly
removed
it
from
the
and
carried
it
around
to
the
front
of
the
house
the
children
looked
at
each
other
in
consternation
when
they
perceived
their
loss
what
we
goin
to

now
asked
billy

by

where
his

and
ran
into
his
own
room

found
the

and
stockings
which

and
soon
had
them
upon

little
feet
miss
minerva
rang

he
walked
quietly
into
the
trying
to
make
as
little
noise
and
to
attract
as
little
attention
from
his
aunt
as
possible
but

fastened
her
eyes

a
blue
glass
bead
from

pocket
and
offered

a
contemptuous
rejection
you

do
perzactly
like

when

mumps
insinuated
jimmy
who
had
seemingly
allied
himself
with
billy
as
a
partner
in
business
grown
folks
bound
to
do
what
little
boys
want
to
when
you
got
the
ikey
increased
his
bid
by
the
stub
of
a
lead
pencil
but
it
was
not
until
he
had
parted
with
his
most
cherished
pocket
possessions
that
he
was
at
last
allowed
to
place
a
gentle
finger
on
the
protuberant
cheek
two
little
girls
with
their

seen
approaching

they
the
two
little
girls
immediately
opened
the
gate
crossed
the
yard
mid
stood
in
front
of
billy
they
inspected
him
with
admiration
he
bore
their
critical
survey
with
affected
unconcern
and
indifference
as
befitted
one
who
had
attained
such
prominence
do
tech
he
commanded
waving
them
off
as
he
leaned
gracefully
against
the
fence
i
teched
boasted
the
younger

gallant
billy
as

swollen
jowl

little
darkey
riding
a
big
black
horse

negro

and
hitched
his
horse
to
the
fence
i
gotter
little
tarrapim
he
began
insinuatingly
and
thus
it
came
to
pass
that
there
was
an
epidemic
of
mumps
in
the
little
town
of
covington
and
william
green
hill
grew
rich
in
marbles
in
tops
in
strings
in
toads
in
chewing
gum
and
in
many
other
things
which
comprise
the
pocket
treasures
of
little
boys
chapter
xxiii
the
infant
mind
shoots
miss
minerva
had
bought
a
book
for
billy
entitled
stories
of
great
and
good
men
which
she
frequently
read
to
him
for
his
education
and
improvement
these
stories
related
the
principal
events
in
the
lives
of
the
heroes
but
never
mentioned
any
names
always
asking
at
the
end
can
you
tell
me
who
this
man
was
her
nephew
heard
the
stories
so
often
that
he
had
some
expression
or
incident
by
which
he
could
identify
each
without
paying
much
attention
while
she
was
reading
he
and
his
aunt
had
just
settled
themselves
on
the
porch
for
a
reading
jimmy
was
on
his
own
porch
cutting
up
funny
capers
and
making
faces
for
the
other
child
amusement

much
enthusiasm

went
to
the
fence
where
he
signaled
jimmy
to
meet
him
aunt
minerva
say
you
come
over
an
listen
to
her
read
some
er
the
pretties
tales
you
ever
hear
he
said
as
if
conferring
a
great
favor
naw
was
the
impolite
response
across
the
fence
them
the
measliest
tales
they
is
i
come
if
she
read
my
uncle
remus
please
come
on
begged
billy
dropping
the
patronizing
manner
that
he
had
assumed
in
hope
of
inducing
his
chum
to
share
his
martyrdom
you
know
aunt
minerva
die
in
her
tracks
she
read
uncle
remus
you

tales

better
anyway
i
give
you
my
stoney
if
you
naw
you
ai
going
to
get

such
box
as
that
if
she
just
read
seven
or
eight
hours
i
would
mind
but
she
get
you
where
she
wants
you
and
read
a
million
hours
i
know
miss
billy
aunt
was
growing
impatient
come
william
she
called
i
am
waiting
for
jimmy
went
back
to
his
own
porch
and
the
other
boy
joined
his
kinswoman
why
would
jimmy
come
she
asked
he
he
ai
feeling
very
well
was
the
considerate
rejoinder
once
there
was
a
little
boy
who
was
born
in
virginia
began
miss
minerva
born
in
a
manger
repeated
the
inattentive
little
boy
to
himself
i
knows
who
that
so
this
important
question
settled
in
his
mind
he
gave
himself
up
to
the
full
enjoyment
of
his
chum
and
to
the
giving
and
receiving
secret
signals
the
pleasure
of
which
was
decidedly
enhanced
by
the
fear
of
imminent
detection
father
i
can
not
tell
a
lie
i
did
it
with
my
little
hatchet
read
the
thin
monotonous
voice
at
his
elbow
billy
laughed
aloud
at
that
minute
jimmy
was
standing
on
his
head
waving
two
chubby
feet
in
the
air
william
said
his
aunt
reprovingly
peering
at
him
over
her
spectacles
i
do
see
anything
to
laugh
at
and
she
did
not
but
then
she
was
in
ignorance
of
the
little
conspiracy
he
was
a
good
and
dutiful
son
and
he
studied
his
lessons
so
well
that
when
he
was
only
seventeen
years
old
he
was
employed
to
survey
vast
tracts
of
land
in
virginia
miss
minerva
emphasized
every
word
hoping
thus
to
impress
her
nephew
but
he
was
so
busy
keeping
one
eye
on
her
and
one
on
the
little
boy
on
the
other
porch
that
he
did
not
have
time
to
use
his
ears
at
all
and
so
did
not
hear
one
word
leaving
his
camp
fires
burning
to
deceive
the
enemy
he
stole
around
by
a
circuitous
route
fell
upon
the
british
and
captured
billy
held
up
his
hands
to
catch
a
ball
which
jimmy
made
believe
to
throw
miss
minerva
still
read
on
unconscious
of
her
nephew
inattention
the
suffering
at
valley
forge
had
been
intense
during
the
winter
billy
made
a
pretense
behind
his
aunt
upright
back
of
throwing
a
ball
while
the
other
child
held
up
two
fat
little
hands
to
receive
it
again
he
laughed
aloud
as
jimmy
spat
on
his
hands
and
ground
the
imaginary
ball
into
his
hip
she
looked
at
him
sternly
over
her
glasses
what
makes
you
so
silly
she
inquired
and
without
waiting
for
a
reply
went
on
with
her
reading
she
was
nearing
the
close
now
and
she
read
carefully
and
deliberately
and
he
was
chosen
the
first
president
of
the
united
billy
put
his
hands
to
his
ears
and
wriggled
his
fingers
at
jimmy
who
promptly
returned
the
compliment
he
had
no
children
of
his
own
so
he
is
called
the
father
of
his
miss
minerva
closed
the
book
turned
to
the
little
boy
at
her
side
and
asked
who
was
this
great
and
good
man
william
jesus
was
his
ready
answer
in
an
appropriately
solemn
little
voice
why
william
green
hill
she
exclaimed
in
disgust

on
the
grass
and
handed
it
to
the
of
the
puppy

his
chum
at
the
cabin
there
under
the
critical
survey
of
bennie
dick
from
his
customary
place
on
the
floor
they
darkened
their
faces
heads
hands
feet
and
legs
then
pulling
their
caps
over
their
eyes
these
energetic
little
boys
stole
out
of
the
back
gate
and
fairly
flew
down
an
alley
to
the
station
no
one
noticed
them
in
that
hot
perspiring
black
crowd
a
lively
band
was
playing
and
the
mob
of
happy
negroes
dressed
in
their
sunday
best
laughing
and
joking
pushing
and
elbowing
made
their
way
to
the
excursion
train
standing
on
the
track
the
two
excited
children
got
directly
behind
a
broad
pompous
negro
and
slipped
on
the
car
just
after
him
fortunately
they
found
a
seat
in
the
rear
of
the
coach
and
there
they
sat
unobserved
still
and
quiet
except
for
an
occasional
delighted
giggle
till
the
bell
clanged
and
the
train
started
off
we

seven
coaches
which

been
taking
on
negroes
at
every
station
up
the
road
as
far
as
paducah
and
it
happened
that
the
two
little
boys
did
not
know
a
soul
in
their
car
but
when
they
were
nearing
woodstock
a
little
station
not
far
from
memphis
sam
lamb
making
a
tour
of
the
cars
came
into
their
coach
and
was
promptly
hailed
by
the
children
when
he
recognized
them
he
burst
into
such
a
roar
of
laughter
that
it
caused
all
the
other
passengers
to
turn
around
and

their
direction

white
miss
minerva
came
out
of
her
front
door
looking
for
billy
at
the
same
time
that
garner
appeared
on
her
porch
in
search
of
jimmy
william
you
william
called
one
woman
o
called
the
other
have
you
seen
my
nephew
asked
the
one
no
have
you
seen
anything
of
jimmy
was
the
reply
of
the
other
they
were
talking
together
at
the
fence
about
an
hour
ago
said
billy
aunt
possibly
they
are
down
at
the
livery
stable
with
sam
lamb
i
phone
and
find
and
i
ring
up
black
and
hamilton
they
may
have
gone
to
see
lina
or
in
a
short
time
both
women
appeared
on
their
porches
again
they
have
not
been
to
the
stable
this
morning
said
miss
minerva
uneasily
and
sam
went
to
memphis
on
the
excursion
and
they
are
not
with
lina
or
frances
garner
face
wore
an
anxious
look
i
declare
i
never
saw
two
such
children
still
i
think
we
need
worry
as
it
is
nearly
dinner
time
and
they
never
miss
their
meals
you
but
the
noon
hour
came
and
with
it
no
hungry
little
boys
then
indeed
did
the
relatives
of
the
children
grow
uneasy
the
two
telephones
were
kept
busy
and
garner
with
several
other
men
on
horseback
scoured
the
village
not
a
soul
had
seen
either
child
at
three
miss
minerva
worn
with
anxiety
and
on
the
verge
of
a
collapse
dropped
into
a
chair
on
her
veranda
her
faithful
major
by
her
side
he
had
come
to
offer
help
and
sympathy
as
soon
as
he
heard
of
her
distress
and
finding
her
in
such
a
softened
dependent
and
receptive
mood
the
major
had
remained
to
try
to
cheer
her
up
and
garner
were
also
on
the
porch
discussing
what
further
steps
they
could
take
it
is
all
the
fault
of
that
william
of
yours
snapped
one
little
mother
to
the
other
little
boy
aunt
jimmy
is
the
best
child
in
the
world
when
he
is
by
himself
but
he
is
easily
led
into
miss
minerva
face
blazed
with
indignation
william
fault
indeed
she
answered
back
there
never
was
a
sweeter
child
than
william
for
the
lonely
woman
knew
the
truth
at
last
at
the
thought
that
her
little
nephew
might
be
hurt
a
long
forgotten
tenderness
stirred
her
bosom
and
she
realized
for
the
first
time
how
the
child
had
grown
into
her
life
the
telegram
came
they
are
all
right
shouted
garner
joyously
as
he
quickly
opened
and
read
the
yellow
missive
they
went
on
the
excursion
and
sam
lamb
is
bringing
them
home
on
the
as
the
major
short
plump
rubicund
jolly
and
miss
minerva
tall
sallow
angular
solemn
were
walking
to
the
station
to
meet
the
train
that
was
bringing
home
the
runaways
the
elderly
lover
knew
himself
to
be
at
last
master
of
the
situation
the
trouble
with
billy
he
began
adjusting
his
steps
to
miss
minerva
mincing
walk
william
she
corrected
faintly
the
trouble
with
billy
repeated
her
suitor
firmly
is
this
you
have
tried
to
make
a
girl
out
of
a
healthy
boy
you
given
him
the
toys
and
playthings
a
boy
should
have
you
have
not
even
given
the
child
common
love
and
he
was
letting
himself
go
for
he
knew
that
she
needed
the
lecture
and
wonderful
to
tell
she
was
listening
meekly
you
have
steeled
your
heart
he
went
on
against
billy
and
against
me
you
have
about
as
much
idea
how
to
manage
a
boy
as
a
as
a
he
hesitated
for
a
suitable
comparison
he
wanted
to
say
goat
but
gallantry
forbade
as
any
other
old
maid
he
blurted
out
realizing
as
he
did
so
that
a
woman
had
rather
be
called
a
goat
than
an
old
maid
any
time
the
color
mounted
to
miss
minerva
face
i
do
have
to
be
an
old
maid
she
snapped
spunkily
no
and
you
are
not
going
to
be
one
any
longer
he
answered
with
decision
i
tell
you
what
miss
minerva
we
are
going
to
make
a
fine
manly
boy
out
of
that
nephew
of
we
she
echoed
faintly
yes
we
i
said
we
did
i
replied
the
major
ostentatiously
the
child
shall
have
a
pony
to
ride
and
every
thing
else
that
a
boy
ought
to
have
he
is
full
of
