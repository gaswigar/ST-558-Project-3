the
indians
would
rise
to
their
feet
for
a
single
moment
this
old
soldier
had
come
in
from
the
long
trail
to
bear
again
the
flag
of
his
country
at
such
a
time
you
will
meet
with
adventures
each
wave
was
singly
a
problem
to
fail
in
whose
solution
meant
instant
swamping
watched
the
long
twilight
steal
up
like
a
gray
cloud
from
the
east
in
this
lovable
mystery
we
journeyed
all
the
rest
of
that
morning
nor
need
you
hope
to
pole
a
canoe
upstream
as
do
these
people
then
in
the
twilight
the
battle
the
forest
i
the
calling
the
red
gods
make
their
medicine
again
some
time
in
february
when
the
snow
and
sleet
have
shut
out
from
the
wearied
mind
even
the
memory
of
spring
the
man
of
the
woods
generally
receives
his
first
inspiration
he
may
catch
it
from
some
chance
remark
a
glance
at
the
map
a
vague
recollection
of
a
dim
past
conversation
or
it
may
flash
on
him
from
the
mere
pronouncement
of
a
name
the
first
faint
thrill
of
discovery
leaves
him
cool
but
gradually
with
the
increasing
enthusiasm
of
cogitation
the
idea
gains
body
until
finally
it
has
grown
to
plan
fit
for
discussion
of
these
many
quickening
potencies
of
inspiration
the
mere
name
of
a
place
seems
to
strike
deepest
at
the
heart
of
romance
colour
mystery
the
vastnesses
of
unexplored
space
are
there
symbolized
compactly
for
the
aliment
of
imagination
it
lures
the
fancy
as
a
fly
lures
the
trout
mattágami
peace
river
kánanaw
the
house
of

touchwood
hills
rupert

the

sticks
flying
post
conjuror
house
how
the
syllables
roll
from
the
tongue
what
pictures
rise
in
instant
response
to
their
suggestion
the
journey
of
a
thousand
miles
seems
not
too
great
a
price
to
pay
for
the
sight
of
a
place
called
the
hills
of
silence
for
acquaintance
with
the
people
who
dwell
there
perhaps
for
a
glimpse
of
the
that
so
named
its
environment
on
the
other
hand
one
would
feel
but
little
desire
to
visit
muggin
corners
even
though
at
their
crossing
one
were
assured
of
the
deepest
flavour
of
the
far
north
the
first
response
to
the
red
god
summons
is
almost
invariably
the
production
of
a
and
the
complete
rearrangement
of
all
its
contents
the
next
is
a
resumption
of
practice
with
the
little
pistol
the
third
and
last
is
pencil
and
paper
and
lists
of
grub
and
duffel
and
estimates
of
routes
and
expenses
and
correspondence
with
men
who
spell
queerly
bear
down
heavily
with
blunt
pencils
and
agree
to
be
at
black
beaver
portage
on
a
certain
date
now
though
the
february
snow
and
sleet
still
shut
him
in
the
spring
has
draw
very
near
he
can
feel
the
warmth
of
her
breath
rustling
through
his
reviving
memories
there
are
said
to
be
roads
to
heaven
of
which
but
one
is
the
true
way
although
here
and
there
a
offers
experimental
variety
to
the
restless
and
bold
the
true
way
for
the
man
in
the
woods
to
attain
the
elusive
best
of
his
wilderness
experience
is
to
go
as
light
as
possible
and
the
of
departure
from
that
principle
lead
only
to
the
slightly
increased
carrying
possibilities
of
canoe
trips
and
permanent
camps
but
these
prove
to
be
not
very
independent
side
paths
never
diverging
so
far
from
the
main
road
that
one
may
dare
hope
to
conceal
from
a
vigilant
eye
that
he
is
going
light
to
go
light
is
to
play
the
game
fairly
the
man
in
the
woods
matches
himself
against
the
forces
of
nature
in
the
towns
he
is
warmed
and
fed
and
clothed
so
spontaneously
and
easily
that
after
a
time
he
perforce
begins
to
doubt
himself
to
wonder
whether
his
powers
are
not
atrophied
from
disuse
and
so
with
his
naked
soul
he
fronts
the
wilderness
it
is
a
test
a
measuring
of
strength
a
proving
of
his
essential
pluck
and
resourcefulness
and
manhood
an
assurance
of
man
highest
potency
the
ability
to
endure
and
to
take
care
of
himself
in
just
so
far
as
he
substitutes
the
of
civilization
for
the
of
the
forest
the
pneumatic
bed
for
the
balsam
boughs
in
just
so
far
is
he
relying
on
other
men
and
other
men
labour
to
take
care
of
him
to
exactly
that
extent
is
the
test
invalidated
he
has
not
proved
a
courteous
antagonist
for
he
has
not
stripped
to
the
contest
to
go
light
is
to
play
the
game
sensibly
for
even
when
it
is
not
so
earnest
nor
the
stake
so
high
a
certain
should
take
the
place
on
a
lower
plane
of
the
sense
on
the
higher
a
great
many
people
find
enjoyment
in
merely
playing
with
nature
through
vacation
they
relax
their
minds
exercise
mildly
their
bodies
and
freshen
the
colours
of
their
outlook
on
life
such
people
like
to
live
comfortably
work
little
and
enjoy
existence
lazily
instead
of
modifying
themselves
to
fit
the
life
of
the
wilderness
they
modify
their
city
methods
to
fit
conditions
they
do
not
need
to
strip
to
the
contest
for
contest
there
is
none
and
indian
packers
are
cheap
at
a
dollar
a
day
but
even
so
the
problem
of
the
greatest
comfort
defining
comfort
as
an
accurate
balance
of
effort
expended
to
results
obtained
can
be
solved
only
by
the
one
formula
and
that
formula
is
again
for
a
superabundance
of
paraphernalia
proves
always
more
of
a
care
than
a
satisfaction
when
the
woods
offer
you
a
thing
ready
made
it
is
the
merest
foolishness
to
transport
that
same
thing
a
hundred
miles
for
the
sake
of
the
manufacturer
trademark
i
once
met
an
outfit
in
the
north
woods
plodding
diligently
across
portage
laden
like
the
camels
of
the
desert
three
indians
swarmed
back
and
forth
a
trips
apiece
an
indian
can
carry
over
two
hundred
pounds
that
evening
a
and
i
visited
their
camp
and
examined
their
outfit
always
with
growing
wonder
they
had
and
about
fifty
pounds
of
hardwood
tent
pegs
in
a
wooded
country
where
such
things
can
be
had
for
a
clip
of
the
axe
they
had
a
system
of
ringed
iron
bars
which
could
be
so
fitted
together
as
to
form
a
low
open
grill
on
which
trout
could
be
broiled
weight
twenty
pounds
and
split
wood
necessary
for
its
efficiency
they
had
air
mattresses
and
and
oil
lanterns
they
had
corpulent
duffel
bags
apiece
that
would
stand
alone
and
enough
changes
of
clothes
to
last
out
a
week
rain
and
the
leader
of
the
party
wore
the
wrinkled
brow
of
tribulation
for
he
had
to
keep
track
of
everything
and
see
that
package
number
was
not
left
and
that
package
number
sixteen
did
not
get
wet
that
the
pneumatic
bed
did
not
get
punctured
and
that
the
canned
goods
did
beside
which
the
caravan
was
moving
at
the
majestic
rate
of
about
five
miles
a
day
now
can
always
be
cut
and
trout
broiled
beautifully
by
a
dozen
other
ways
and
candle
lanterns
fold
up
and
balsam
can
be
laid
in
such
a
manner
as
to
be
as
springy
as
a
pneumatic
mattress
and
if
desired
can
be
quickly
constructed
with
an
axe
and
clothes
can
always
be
washed
or
dried
as
long
as
fire
burns
and
water
runs
and
any
one
of
fifty
other
items
of
laborious
burden
could
have
been
ingeniously
and
quickly
substituted
by
any
one
of
the
indians
it
was
not
that
we
concealed
a
bucolic
scorn
of
effete
but
solid
comfort
only
it
did
seem
ridiculous
that
a
man
should
cumber
himself
with
a
fifth
wheel
on
a
smoothly
macadamized
road
the
next
morning
billy
and
i
went
cheerfully
on
our
way
we
were
carrying
an
axe
a
gun
blankets
an
extra
pair
of
drawers
and
socks
apiece
a
little
grub
and
an
shelter
tent
we
had
been
out
a
week
and
we
were
having
a
good
time
ii
the
science
of
going
light
now
the
lodge
is
opened
now
the
smokes
of
council
rise
pleasant
smokes
ere
yet
trail
and
trail
they
choose
you
can
no
more
be
told
how
to
go
light
than
you
can
be
told
how
to
hit
a
ball
with
a
bat
it
is
something
that
must
be
lived
through
and
all
advice
on
the
subject
has
just
about
the
value
of
an
answer
to
a
bashful
young
man
who
begged
from
one
of
our
woman
periodicals
help
in
overcoming
the
diffidence
felt
on
entering
a
crowded
room
the
reply
read
cultivate
an
easy
graceful
manner
in
like
case
i
might
hypothecate
to
go
light
discard
all
but
the
really
necessary
articles
the
were
you
to
press
me
close
would
be
the
definition
of
the
word
necessary
for
the
terms
of
such
definition
would
have
to
be
those
solely
and
simply
of
a
man
experience
comforts
even
most
desirable
comforts
are
not
necessities
a
dozen
times
a
day
trifling
emergencies
will
seem
precisely
to
call
for
some
little
handy
contrivance
that
would
be
just
the
thing
were
it
in
the
pack
rather
than
at
home
a
disgorger
does
the
business
better
than
a
a
pair
of
oilskin
trousers
turns
the
wet
better
than
does
kersey
a
will
burn
merrily
in
a
rain
lively
enough
to
drown
an
open
fire
yet
neither
disgorger
nor
oilskins
nor
can
be
considered
in
the
light
of
necessities
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
conditions
of
their
use
occur
too
infrequently
to
compensate
for
the
pains
of
their
carriage
or
to
put
it
the
other
way
a
few
work
with
a
knife
wet
knees
occasionally
or
an
infrequent
soggy
meal
are
not
too
great
a
price
to
pay
for
unburdened
shoulders
nor
on
the
other
hand
must
you
conclude
that
because
a
thing
is
a
mere
luxury
in
town
it
is
nothing
but
that
in
the
woods
most
woodsmen
own
some
little
ridiculous
item
of
outfit
without
which
they
could
not
be
happy
and
when
a
man
can
not
be
happy
lacking
a
thing
that
thing
becomes
a
necessity
i
knew
one
who
never
stirred
without
borated
talcum
powder
another
who
must
have
his
a
third
who
was
miserable
without
a
small
bottle
of
salad
dressing
i
confess
to
a
pair
of
light
buckskin
gloves
each
man
must
decide
for
himself
remembering
always
the
endurance
limit
of
human
shoulders
a
necessity
is
that
which
your
own
you
have
found
you
can
not
do
without
as
a
bit
of
practical
advice
however
the
following
system
of
elimination
may
be
recommended
when
you
return
from
a
trip
turn
your
duffel
bag
upside
down
on
the
floor
of
the
contents
make
three
piles
three
piles
conscientiously
selected
in
the
light
of
what
has
happened
rather
than
what
ought
to
have
happened
or
what
might
have
happened
it
is
difficult
to
do
this
preconceived
notions
habits
of
civilization
theory
for
future
imagination
all
stand
in
the
eye
of
your
honesty
pile
number
one
should
comprise
those
articles
you
have
used
every
day
pile
number
two
those
you
have
used
occasionally
pile
number
three
those
you
have
not
used
at
all
if
you
are
resolute
and
singleminded
you
will
at
once
discard
the
latter
two
throughout
the
following
winter
you
will
be
attacked
by
misgivings
to
be
sure
you
wore
the
mosquito
hat
but
once
or
twice
and
the
fourth
pair
of
socks
not
at
all
but
then
the
mosquitoes
might
be
thicker
next
time
and
a
series
of
rainy
days
and
cold
nights
might
make
it
desirable
to
have
a
dry
pair
of
socks
to
put
on
at
night
the
past
has
been
but
the
future
might
be
one
by
one
the
discarded
creep
back
into
the
list
and
by
the
opening
of
next
season
you
have
made
toward
perfection
by
only
the
little
space
of
a
mackintosh
coat
and
a
gun
but
in
the
years
to
come
you
learn
better
and
better
the
simple
woods
lesson
of
substitution
or
doing
without
you
find
that
discomfort
is
as
soon
forgotten
as
pain
that
almost
anything
can
be
endured
if
it
is
but
for
the
time
being
that
absolute
physical
comfort
is
worth
but
a
very
small
price
in
avoirdupois
your
pack
shrinks
in
fact
it
really
never
ceases
shrinking
only
last
summer
taught
me
the
uselessness
of
an
extra
pair
of
trousers
it
rains
in
the
woods
streams
are
to
be
waded
the
wetness
of
leaves
is
greater
than
the
wetness
of
many
rivers
logically
naturally
inevitably
such
conditions
point
to
change
of
garments
when
camp
is
made
we
always
change
our
clothes
when
we
get
wet
in
the
city
so
for
years
i
carried
those
extra
nether
garments
and
continued
in
the
natural
exposure
to
sun
and
wind
and
to
dry
off
before
change
time
or
to
hang
the
damp
clothes
from
the
for
resumption
in
the
morning
and
then
one
day
the
web
of
that
particular
convention
broke
we
change
wet
trousers
in
the
town
we
do
not
in
the
woods
the
extras
were
relegated
to
pile
number
three
and
my
pack
already
apparently
down
to
a
minimum
lost
a
few
pounds
more
you
will
want
a
hat
a
hat
to
turn
rain
with
a
medium
brim
if
you
are
wise
you
will
get
it
too
small
for
your
head
and
rip
out
the
lining
the
felt
will
cling
tenaciously
to
your
hair
so
that
you
will
find
the
snatches
of
the
brush
and
the
wind
generally
unavailing
by
way
of
undergarments
wear
woollen
buy
winter
weights
even
for
midsummer
in
travelling
with
a
pack
a
man
is
going
to
sweat
in
streams
no
matter
what
he
puts
on
or
takes
off
and
the
thick
garment
will
be
found
no
more
oppressive
than
the
thin
and
then
in
the
cool
of
the
woods
or
of
the
evening
he
avoids
a
chill
and
he
can
plunge
into
the
coldest
water
with
impunity
sure
that
ten
minutes
of
the
air
will
dry
him
fairly
well
until
you
have
shivered
in
clammy
cotton
you
can
not
realize
the
importance
of
this
point
ten
minutes
of
cotton
underwear
in
cold
water
will
chill
on
the
other
hand
suitably
clothed
in
wool
i
have
waded
the
ice
water
of
north
country
streams
when
the
thermometer
was
so
low
i
could
see
my
breath
in
the
air
without
other
discomfort
than
a
cold
ring
around
my
legs
to
mark
the
surface
of
the
water
and
a
slight
numbness
in
my
feet
when
i
emerged
therefore
even
in
hot
weather
wear
heavy
wool
it
is
the
most
comfortable
undoubtedly
you
will
come
to
believe
this
only
by
experience
do
not
carry
a
coat
this
is
another
preconception
of
civilization
exceedingly
difficult
to
get
rid
of
you
will
never
wear
it
while
packing
in
a
rain
you
will
find
that
it
wets
through
so
promptly
as
to
be
of
little
use
or
if
waterproof
the
inside
condensation
will
more
than
equal
the
in
camp
you
will
discard
it
because
it
will
impede
the
swing
of
your
arms
the
end
of
that
coat
will
be
a
brief
after
supper
and
a
makeshift
roll
to
serve
as
a
pillow
during
the
night
and
for
these
a
sweater
is
better
in
every
way
in
fact
if
you
feel
you
must
possess
another
outside
garment
let
it
be
an
extra
sweater
you
can
sleep
in
it
use
it
when
your
day
garment
is
soaked
or
even
tie
things
in
it
as
in
a
bag
it
is
not
necessary
however
one
good
shirt
is
enough
when
you
wash
it
substitute
the
sweater
until
it
dries
in
fact
by
keeping
the
sweater
always
in
your
waterproof
bag
you
possess
a
dry
garment
to
change
into
two
handkerchiefs
are
enough
one
should
be
of
silk
for
neck
head
or
in
case
of
cramps
or
intense
cold
the
the
other
of
coloured
cotton
for
the
pocket
both
can
be
quickly
washed
and
dried
three
pairs
of
heavy
wool
socks
will
be
enough
one
for
wear
one
for
night
and
one
for
extra
a
second
pair
of
drawers
supplements
the
sweater
when
a
temporary
day
change
is
desirable
heavy
kersey
driver
trousers
are
the
best
they
are
cheap
dry
very
quickly
and
are
not
easily
picked
out
by
the
brush
the
best
blanket
is
that
made
by
the
hudson
bay
company
for
its
servants
a
for
summer
is
heavy
enough
the
next
best
is
our
own
gray
army
blanket
one
of
rubber
should
fold
about
it
and
a
pair
of
narrow
buckle
straps
is
handy
to
keep
the
bundle
right
and
tight
and
waterproof
as
for
a
tent
buy
the
smallest
shelter
you
can
get
along
with
have
it
made
of
balloon
silk
well
waterproofed
and
supplement
it
with
a
duplicate
tent
of
light
cheesecloth
to
suspend
inside
as
a
defence
a
which
would
weigh
between
twenty
and
thirty
pounds
if
made
of
duck
means
only
about
eight
pounds
constructed
of
this
material
and
it
is
waterproof
i
own
one
which
i
have
used
for
three
seasons
it
has
been
employed
as
tarpaulin
fly
even
blanket
on
a
pinch
it
has
been
packed
through
the
roughest
country
i
have
even
pressed
it
into
service
as
a
sort
of
canoe
lining
but
it
is
still
as
good
as
ever
such
a
tent
sometimes
condenses
a
little
moisture
in
a
cold
rain
but
it
never
sprays
as
does
a
duck
shelter
it
never
leaks
simply
because
you
have
accidentally
touched
its
and
best
of
all
it
weighs
no
more
after
a
rain
than
before
it
this
latter
item
is
perhaps
its
best
recommendation
the
confronting
with
equanimity
of
a
wet
day
journey
in
the
brush
of
our
northern
forests
requires
a
degree
of
philosophy
which
a
gratuitous
ten
pounds
of
water
sometimes
most
effectually
breaks
down
i
know
of
but
one
place
where
such
a
tent
can
be
bought
the
address
will
be
gladly
sent
to
any
one
practically
interested
as
for
the
actual
implements
of
the
trade
they
are
not
many
although
of
course
the
sporting
goods
stores
are
full
of
all
sorts
of
handy
contrivances
a
small
axe
one
of
the
pocket
size
will
do
if
you
get
the
right
shape
and
balance
although
a
light
regulation
axe
is
better
a
of
the
best
steel
a
a
compass
a
waterproof
firearms
and
cooking
utensils
comprise
the
list
all
others
belong
to
permanent
camps
or
cruises
not
to
hikes
in
the
woods
the
items
with
the
exception
of
the
last
two
seem
to
explain
themselves
during
the
summer
months
in
the
north
woods
you
will
not
need
a
rifle
partridges
spruce
hens
ptarmigan
rabbits
ducks
and
geese
are
usually
abundant
enough
to
fill
the
provision
list
for
them
of
course
a
shotgun
is
the
thing
but
since
such
a
weapon
weighs
many
pounds
and
its
ammunition
many
more
i
have
come
gradually
to
depend
entirely
on
a
pistol
the
instrument
is
single
shot
carries
a
barrel
is
fitted
with
a
special
butt
and
is
built
on
the
graceful
lines
of
a
smith
and
wesson
revolver
its
cartridge
is
the
a
target
size
that
carries
as
accurately
as
you
can
hold
for
upwards
of
a
hundred
yards
with
it
i
have
often
killed
a
of
partridges
from
the
same
tree
the
ammunition
is
light
altogether
it
is
a
most
satisfactory
convenient
and
accurate
weapon
and
quite
adequate
to
all
small
game
in
fact
an
indian
named
tawabinisáy
after
seeing
it
perform
once
borrowed
it
to
kill
a
moose
illustration
this
old
soldier
had
come
in
from
the
long
trail
to
bear
again
the
flag
of
his
country
i
shootum
in
eye
said
he
by
way
of
cooking
utensils
buy
aluminium
it
is
expensive
but
so
light
and
so
easily
cleaned
that
it
is
well
worth
all
you
may
have
to
pay
if
you
are
alone
you
will
not
want
to
carry
much
hardware
i
made
a
trip
once
with
nothing
but
a
tin
cup
and
a
dishes
pails
and
other
receptacles
can
always
be
made
of
birch
bark
and
cedar
withes
by
one
who
knows
how
the
ideal
outfit
for
two
or
three
is
a
cup
fork
and
spoon
apiece
one
two
and
a
the
latter
can
be
used
as
a
a
few
minor
items
of
practically
no
weight
suggest
themselves
toilet
requisites
needle
and
thread
a
cathartic
a
roll
of
surgeon
bandage
pipe
and
tobacco
but
when
the
pack
is
made
up
and
the
duffel
bag
tied
you
find
that
while
fitted
for
every
emergency
but
that
of
catastrophe
you
are
prepared
to
go
light
iii
the
place
sometime
no
matter
how
long
your
journey
you
will
reach
a
spot
whose
psychological
effect
is
so
exactly
like
a
dozen
others
that
you
will
recognize
at
once
its
kinship
with
former
experience
mere
physical
likeness
does
not
count
at
all
it
may
possess
a
of
laths
and
sawdust
or
an
outlook
over
broad
shimmering
plains
it
may
front
the
impassive
fringe
of
a
forest
or
it
may
skirt
the
calm
stretch
of
a
river
but
whether
of
log
or
mud
stone
or
unpainted
board
its
identity
becomes
at
first
sight
indubitably
evident
were
you
by
the
wave
of
some
beneficent
wand
to
be
transported
direct
to
it
from
the
heart
of
the
city
you
could
not
fail
to
recognize
it
the
place
you
would
cry
ecstatically
and
turn
with
unerring
instinct
to
the
aromatic
shop
for
here
is
where
begins
the
long
trail
whether
it
will
lead
you
through
the
forests
or
up
the
hills
or
over
the
plains
or
by
invisible
water
paths
whether
you
will
accomplish
it
on
horseback
or
in
canoe
or
by
the
transportation
of
your
own
two
legs
whether
your
companions
shall
be
white
or
red
or
merely
the
voices
of
the
wilds
these
things
matter
not
a
particle
in
the
symbol
of
this
little
town
you
loose
your
hold
on
the
world
of
made
things
and
shift
for
yourself
among
the
unchanging
conditions
of
nature
here
the
faint
forest
flavour
the
subtle
invisible
breath
of
freedom
stirs
faintly
across
men
conventions
the
ordinary
affairs
of
life
savour
of
this
tang
a
trace
of
wildness
in
the
domesticated
berry
in
the
dress
of
the
inhabitants
is
a
dash
of
colour
a
carelessness
of
port
in
the
manner
of
their
greeting
is
the
clear
taciturnity
of
the
silent
places
through
the
web
of
their
gray
talk
of
ways
and
means
and
men
simpler
beliefs
runs
a
thread
of
colour
one
hears
strange
suggestive
words
and
phrases
arapajo
capote
arroyo
the
diamond
hitch
cache
butte
coulé
muskegs
portage
and
a
dozen
others
coined
into
the
tender
of
daily
use
and
occasionally
when
the
expectation
is
least
alert
one
encounters
suddenly
the
very
symbol
of
the
wilderness
itself
a
cowboy
an
indian
packer
with
his
straight
hair
a
voyageur
gay
in
red
sash
and
ornamented
moccasins
one
of
the
company
canoemen
from
the
river
no
costumed
show
exhibit
but
fitting
naturally
into
the
scene
bringing
something
of
the
open
space
with
him
so
that
in
your
imagination
the
little
town
gradually
takes
on
the
colour
of
mystery
which
an
older
community
utterly
lacks
but
perhaps
the
strongest
of
the
influences
which
unite
to
assure
the
psychological
kinships
of
the
places
is
that
of
the
aromatic
shop
it
is
usually
a
board
affair
with
a
broad
high
sidewalk
shaded
by
a
wooden
awning
you
enter
through
a
narrow
door
and
find
yourself
facing
two
dusky
aisles
separated
by
a
narrow
division
of
goods
and
flanked
by
wooden
counters
so
far
it
is
exactly
like
the
corner
store
of
our
rural
districts
but
in
the
dimness
of
these
two
aisles
lurks
the
spirit
of
the
wilds
there
in
a
row
hang
fifty
pair
of
moccasins
in
another
an
equal
number
of
across
the
background
you
can
make
out
snowshoes
the
shelves
are
high
with
blankets
thick
and
warm
for
the
should
you
care
to
examine
the
storekeeper
will
hook
down
from
aloft
capotes
of
different
degrees
of
fineness
fathoms
of
black
lie
coiled
in
tubs
welter
in
a
tangle
of
dimness
on
a
series
of
little
shelves
is
the
ammunition
fascinating
in
the
attraction
of
mere
numbers
winchester
colt
they
all
connote
something
to
the
accustomed
mind
just
as
do
the
numbered
street
names
of
new
york
an
exploration
is
always
bringing
something
new
to
light
among
the
commonplaces
of
ginghams
and
working
shirts
and
canned
goods
and
stationery
and
the
other
thousands
of
civilized
drearinesses
to
found
in
every
country
store
from
under
the
counter
you
drag
out
a
mink
skin
or
so
from
the
dark
corner
an
assortment
of
steel
traps
in
a
loft
a
mokok
fifty
pounds
heavy
with
granulated
maple
sugar
dispenses
a
faint
perfume
for
this
is
above
all
the
aromatic
shop
a
hundred
ghosts
of
odours
mingle
to
produce
the
spirit
of
it
the
reek
of
the
is
in
its
buckskin
of
the
woods
in
its
birch
bark
of
the
muskegs
in
its
sweet
grass
of
the
open
spaces
in
its
peltries
of
the
evening
meal
in
its
coffees
and
bacons
of
the
portage
trail
in
the
leather
of
the
i
am
speaking
now
of
the
country
of
which
we
are
to
write
the
shops
of
the
other
places
are
equally
aromatic
whether
with
the
leather
of
saddles
the
freshness
of
ash
paddles
or
the
pungency
of
marline
and
once
the
smell
of
them
is
in
your
nostrils
you
can
not
but
away
the
aromatic
shop
is
always
kept
by
the
wisest
the
most
accommodating
the
most
charming
shopkeeper
in
the
world
he
has
all
leisure
to
give
you
and
enters
into
the
innermost
spirit
of
your
buying
he
is
of
supernal
sagacity
in
regard
to
supplies
and
outfits
and
if
he
does
not
know
all
about
routes
at
least
he
is
acquainted
with
the
very
man
who
can
tell
you
everything
you
want
to
know
he
leans
both
elbows
on
the
counter
you
swing
your
feet
and
together
you
go
over
the
list
while
the
indian
stands
smoky
and
silent
in
the
background
now
if
i
was
you
says
he
i
take
just
a
little
more
pork
you
wo
be
so
much
yourself
but
these
injuns
ai
got
no
bottom
when
it
comes
to
and
i
would
buy
all
that
coffee
you
ai
goin
to
want
much
after
the
first
edge
is
worn
off
tea
the
boy
the
indian
shoots
a
few
rapid
words
across
the
discussion
he
says
you
want
some
iron
shoes
to
fit
on
canoe
poles
for
when
you
come
back
interprets
your
friend
i
guess
that
right
i
ai
got
none
but
th
blacksmith
fit
you
out
all
right
you
find
him
just
below
never
mind
do
you
bother
i
see
to
all
that
for
you
the
next
morning
he
saunters
into
view
at
the
thought
see
you
off
he
replies
to
your
expression
of
surprise
at
his
early
rising
take
care
of
yourself
and
so
the
last
of
civilization
is
extended
to
you
from
the
little
aromatic
shop
occasionally
however
though
very
rarely
you
step
to
the
long
trail
from
the
streets
of
a
raw
modern
town
the
chance
presence
of
some
local
industry
demanding
a
large
population
of
workmen
combined
with
railroad
transportation
may
plant
an
city
in
the
middle
of
the
wilderness
lumber
mines
especially
of
the
baser
metals
or
commercial
minerals
fisheries
a
terminus
of
water
freightage
may
one
or
all
call
into
existence
a
community
a
hundred
years
in
advance
of
its
environment
then
you
lose
the
savour
of
the
nothing
can
quite
take
the
place
of
the
instant
plunge
into
the
wilderness
for
you
must
travel
three
or
four
days
from
such
a
place
before
you
sense
the
forest
in
its
vastness
even
though
deer
may
eat
the
cabbages
at
the
edge
of
town
occasionally
however
by
force
of
crude
contrast
to
the
atmosphere
the
breath
of
the
woods
reaches
your
cheek
and
always
you
own
a
very
tender
feeling
for
the
cause
of
it
dick
and
myself
were
caught
in
such
a
place
it
was
an
unfinished
little
town
with
stores
swaying
over
fathomless
mud
big
superintendent
and
millowner
houses
of
bastard
architecture
in
a
blatant
superiority
of
hill
location
a
hotel
whose
office
chairs
supported
a
variety
of
cheap
drummers
and
stores
screeching
in
an
attempt
at
metropolitan
smartness
we
inspected
the
standpipe
and
the
docks
walked
a
careless
mile
of
board
walk
kicked
a
dozen
pugnacious
dogs
from
our
setter
deuce
and
found
ourselves
at
the
end
of
our
resources
as
a
crowd
seemed
to
be
gathering
about
the
wooden
railway
station
we
joined
it
in
sheer
idleness
it
seemed
that
an
election
had
taken
place
the
day
before
that
one
smith
had
been
chosen
to
the
assembly
and
that
though
this
district
had
gone
the
candidate
was
expected
to
stop
off
an
hour
on
his
way
to
a
more
westerly
point
consequently
the
town
was
on
hand
to
receive
him
the
crowd
we
soon
discovered
was
bourgeois
in
the
extreme
young
men
from
the
mill
escorted
young
women
from
the
shops
the
young
men
wore
flaring
collars
three
sizes
too
large
the
young
women
white
cotton
mitts
three
sizes
too
small
the
older
men
spat
and
talked
through
their
noses
the
women
drawled
out
a
monotonous
flow
of
speech
concerning
the
annoyances
of
domestic
life
a
gang
of
uncouth
practical
jokers
exploding
in
skylarked
about
jostling
rudely
a
village
band
uniformed
solely
with
cheap
caps
brayed
excruciatingly
the
reception
committee
had
decorated
with
red
and
white
silesia
streamers
and
rosettes
an
ordinary
buggy
to
which
a
long
rope
had
been
attached
that
the
great
man
might
be
dragged
by
his
to
the
public
square
nobody
seemed
to
be
taking
the
affair
too
seriously
it
was
evidently
more
than
half
a
joke
was
more
in
evidence
than
the
winning
party
just
this
touch
of
buffoonery
completed
our
sense
of
the
character
of
the
situation
the
town
was
tawdry
in
its
preparations
and
knew
it
but
half
sincere
in
its
enthusiasm
and
knew
it
if
the
crowd
had
been
composed
of
americans
we
should
have
anticipated
an
unhappy
time
for
smith
but
good
loyal
canadians
by
the
limitations
of
temperament
could
get
no
further
than
a
spirit
of
manifest
irreverence
in
the
shifting
of
the
groups
dick
and
i
became
separated
but
shortly
i
made
him
out
worming
his
way
excitedly
toward
me
his
open
in
his
hand
come
here
he
whispered
there
going
to
be
fun
they
going
to
open
up
on
old
smith
after
all
i
followed
the
decorated
buggy
might
be
well
meant
the
village
band
need
not
have
been
interpreted
as
an
ironical
compliment
the
rest
of
the
celebration
might
indicate
paucity
of
resource
rather
than
facetious
intent
but
surely
the
figure
of
fun
before
us
could
not
be
otherwise
construed
than
as
a
deliberate
advertising
in
the
face
of
success
of
the
town
real
attitude
toward
the
celebration
the
man
was
short
he
wore
a
felt
hat
so
big
that
it
rested
on
his
ears
a
gray
wool
shirt
hung
below
his
neck
a
cutaway
coat
miles
too
large
depended
below
his
knees
and
to
the
first
joints
of
his
fingers
by
way
of
official
uniform
his
legs
were
incased
in
an
ordinary
rough
pair
of
miller
white
trousers
on
which
broad
strips
of
red
flannel
had
been
roughly
sewn
everything
was
wrinkled
in
the
folds
of
as
though
to
accentuate
the
note
the
man
stood
very
erect
very
military
and
supported
in
one
hand
the
staff
of
an
english
flag
this
figure
of
fun
this
man
made
from
the
this
caricature
of
a
scarecrow
had
been
put
forth
by
facetiousness
to
the
post
of
greatest
honour
he
was
to
the
occasion
surely
subtle
irony
could
go
no
further
a
sudden
movement
caused
the
man
to
turn
one
sleeve
of
the
faded
ridiculous
old
cutaway
was
empty
he
turned
again
from
under
the
hat
looked
unflinchingly
the
clear
steady
blue
eye
of
the
woodsman
and
so
we
knew
this
old
soldier
had
come
in
from
the
long
trail
to
bear
again
the
flag
of
his
country
if
his
clothes
were
old
and
at
least
they
were
his
best
and
the
largeness
of
the
empty
sleeve
belittled
the
of
the
other
in
all
this
ribald
laughing
irreverent
commonplace
crowd
he
was
the
one
note
of
sincerity
to
him
this
was
a
real
occasion
and
the
exalted
reverence
in
his
eye
for
the
task
he
was
so
simply
performing
was
smith
real
triumph
if
he
could
have
known
it
we
understood
now
we
felt
the
imminence
of
the
long
trail
for
the
first
time
the
little
brick
tawdry
town
gripped
our
hearts
with
the
thrill
of
the
place
suddenly
the
great
simple
unashamed
wilderness
drew
near
us
as
with
the
rush
of
wings
iv
on
making
camp
who
hath
smelt
at
twilight
who
hath
heard
the
birch
log
burning
who
is
quick
to
read
the
noises
of
the
night
let
him
follow
with
the
others
for
the
young
men
feet
are
turning
to
the
camps
of
proved
desire
and
known
delight
in
the
ojibway
language
means
a
good
spot
for
camping
a
place
cleared
for
a
camp
a
camp
as
an
abstract
proposition
and
a
camp
in
the
concrete
as
represented
by
a
tent
a
thatched
shelter
or
a
conical
tepee
in
like
manner
the
english
word
lends
itself
to
a
variety
of
concepts
i
once
slept
in
a
bed
over
a
polished
floor
in
an
elaborate
structure
which
mainly
because
it
was
built
of
logs
and
overlooked
a
lake
the
owner
always
spoke
of
as
his
camp
again
i
once
slept
on
a
bed
of
prairie
grass
before
a
fire
of
dried
buffalo
chips
and
mesquite
wrapped
in
a
single
light
blanket
while
a
good
vigorous
made
new
cold
places
on
me
and
under
me
all
night
in
the
morning
the
cowboy
with
whom
i
was
travelling
remarked
that
this
was
sure
a
lonesome
proposition
as
a
camp
between
these
two
extremes
is
infinite
variety
grading
upwards
through
the
divers
bivouacs
of
snow
plains
pines
or
hills
to
the
bark
shelter
past
the
the
the
to
the
elaborate
permanent
canvas
cottage
of
the
luxurious
camper
the
winter
retreat
of
the
range
cowboy
the
trapper
cabin
the
great
communities
and
the
last
refinements
of
sybaritic
summer
homes
in
the
adirondacks
all
these
are
camps
and
when
you
talk
of
making
camp
you
must
know
whether
that
process
is
to
mean
only
a
search
for
rattlesnakes
and
enough
fuel
to
boil
tea
or
a
winter
consultation
with
an
expert
architect
whether
your
camp
is
to
be
made
on
the
principle
of
omar
sultan
or
whether
it
is
intended
to
accommodate
the
full
days
of
an
entire
summer
but
to
those
who
tread
the
long
trail
the
making
of
camp
resolves
itself
into
an
algebraical
formula
after
a
man
has
travelled
all
day
through
the
northern
wilderness
he
wants
to
rest
and
anything
that
stands
between
himself
and
his
repose
he
must
get
rid
of
in
as
few
motions
as
is
consistent
with
reasonable
thoroughness
the
end
in
view
is
a
hot
meal
and
a
comfortable
dry
place
to
sleep
the
straighter
he
can
draw
the
line
to
those
two
points
the
happier
he
is
early
in
his
woods
experience
dick
became
possessed
with
the
desire
to
do
everything
for
himself
as
this
was
a
laudable
striving
for
i
called
a
halt
at
about
three
one
afternoon
in
order
to
give
him
plenty
of
time
now
dick
is
a
good
active
boy
possessed
of
average
intelligence
and
rather
more
than
average
zeal
he
even
had
theory
of
a
sort
for
he
had
read
various
boy
campers
or
the
trapper
guide
how
to
camp
out
the
science
of
woodcraft
and
other
able
works
he
certainly
had
ideas
enough
and
confidence
enough
i
sat
down
on
a
log
at
the
end
of
three
hours
flusteration
heat
worry
and
good
hard
work
he
had
accomplished
the
following
results
a
tent
very
saggy
very
askew
covered
a
area
it
was
not
a
rectangle
of
very
bumpy
ground
a
bonfire
in
the
centre
of
which
an
inaccessible
toppled
menacingly
alternately
threatened
to
ignite
the
entire
surrounding
forest
or
to
go
out
altogether
through
lack
of
fuel
personal
belongings
strewed
the
ground
near
the
fire
and
provisions
cumbered
the
entrance
to
the
tent
dick
was
anxiously
mixing
batter
for
the
cakes
attempting
to
stir
a
pot
of
rice
often
enough
to
prevent
it
from
burning
and
trying
to
rustle
sufficient
dry
wood
to
keep
the
fire
going
this
diversity
of
interests
certainly
made
him
sit
up
and
pay
attention
at
each
instant
he
had
to
desert
his
to
rescue
the
or
to
shift
the
kettle
or
to
dab
hastily
at
the
rice
or
to
stamp
out
the
small
brush
or
to
pile
on
more
dry
twigs
his
movements
were
not
graceful
they
raised
a
scurry
of
dry
bark
ashes
wood
dust
twigs
leaves
and
pine
needles
a
certain
proportion
of
which
found
their
way
into
the
coffee
the
rice
and
the
sticky
batter
while
the
smaller
articles
of
personal
belonging
hastily
dumped
from
the
gradually
disappeared
from
view
in
the
manner
of
pompeii
and
ancient
vesuvius
dick
burned
his
fingers
and
stumbled
about
and
swore
and
looked
so
through
the
smoke
that
i
seated
on
the
log
at
the
same
time
laughed
and
pitied
and
in
the
end
when
he
needed
a
continuous
steady
fire
to
fry
his
cakes
he
suddenly
discovered
that
dry
twigs
do
not
make
coals
and
that
his
previous
operations
had
used
up
all
the
fuel
within
easy
circle
of
the
camp
so
he
had
to
drop
everything
for
the
purpose
of
rustling
wood
while
the
coffee
chilled
the
rice
cooled
the
bacon
congealed
and
all
the
provisions
cooked
and
uncooked
gathered
entomological
specimens
at
the
last
the
poor
bedeviled
theorist
made
a
hasty
meal
of
scorched
food
brazenly
postponed
the
washing
of
dishes
until
the
morrow
and
coiled
about
his
hummocky
couch
to
dream
the
nightmares
of
complete
exhaustion
poor
dick
i
knew
exactly
how
he
felt
how
the
low
afternoon
sun
scorched
how
the
fire
darted
out
at
unexpected
places
how
the
smoke
followed
him
around
no
matter
on
which
side
of
the
fire
he
placed
himself
how
the
flies
all
took
to
biting
when
both
hands
were
occupied
and
how
they
all
miraculously
disappeared
when
he
had
set
down
the
and
knife
to
fight
them
i
could
sympathize
too
with
the
lonely
forlorn
feeling
that
clutched
him
after
it
was
all
over
i
could
remember
how
big
and
forbidding
and
unfriendly
the
forest
had
once
looked
to
me
in
like
circumstances
so
that
i
had
felt
suddenly
thrust
outside
into
empty
spaces
almost
was
i
tempted
to
intervene
but
i
liked
dick
and
i
wanted
to
do
him
good
this
experience
was
harrowing
but
it
prepared
his
mind
for
the
seeds
of
wisdom
by
the
following
morning
he
had
chastened
his
spirit
forgotten
the
assurance
breathed
from
the
windy
pages
of
the
boy
trapper
library
and
was
ready
to
learn
have
you
ever
watched
a
competent
portraitist
at
work
the
infinite
pains
a
skilled
man
spends
on
the
preliminaries
before
he
takes
one
step
towards
a
likeness
nearly
always
wears
down
the
patience
of
the
sitter
he
measures
with
his
eye
he
plumbs
he
sketches
tentatively
he
places
in
here
a
dab
there
a
blotch
he
puts
behind
him
apparently
unproductive
hours
and
then
all
at
once
he
is
ready
to
begin
something
that
will
not
have
to
be
done
over
again
an
amateur
however
is
carried
away
by
his
desire
for
results
he
dashes
in
a
early
effect
which
grows
into
an
approximate
likeness
almost
immediately
but
which
will
require
infinite
labour
alteration
and
anxiety
to
beat
into
finished
shape
the
case
of
the
artist
in
making
camps
is
exactly
similar
and
the
philosophical
reasons
for
his
failure
are
exactly
the
same
to
the
superficial
mind
a
camp
is
a
shelter
a
bright
fire
and
a
smell
of
cooking
so
when
a
man
is
very
tired
he
cuts
across
lots
to
those
three
results
he
pitches
his
tent
lights
his
fire
puts
over
his
food
and
finds
himself
drowned
in
detail
like
my
friend
dick
the
following
is
in
brief
what
during
the
next
six
weeks
i
told
that
youth
by
precept
by
homily
and
by
making
the
solution
so
obvious
that
he
could
work
it
out
for
himself
when
five
or
six
draws
near
begin
to
look
about
you
for
a
good
level
dry
place
elevated
some
few
feet
above
the
surroundings
drop
your
pack
or
beach
your
canoe
examine
the
location
carefully
you
will
want
two
trees
about
ten
feet
apart
from
which
to
suspend
your
tent
and
a
bit
of
flat
ground
underneath
them
of
course
the
flat
ground
need
not
be
particularly
unencumbered
by
brush
or
saplings
so
the
combination
ought
not
to
be
hard
to
discover
now
return
to
your
canoe
do
not
unpack
the
tent
with
the
little
axe
clear
the
ground
thoroughly
by
bending
a
sapling
over
strongly
with
the
left
hand
clipping
sharply
at
the
strained
fibres
and
then
bending
it
as
strongly
the
other
way
to
repeat
the
axe
stroke
on
the
other
side
you
will
find
that
treelets
of
even
two
or
three
inches
diameter
can
be
felled
by
two
blows
in
a
very
few
moments
you
will
have
accomplished
a
hole
in
the
forest
and
your
two
supporting
trees
will
stand
sentinel
at
either
end
of
a
most
clearing
do
not
unpack
the
tent
now
although
the
ground
seems
free
of
all
but
unimportant
growths
go
over
it
thoroughly
for
little
shrubs
and
leaves
they
look
soft
and
yielding
but
are
often
possessed
of
unexpectedly
abrasive
roots
besides
they
mask
the
face
of
the
ground
when
you
have
finished
pulling
them
up
by
the
roots
you
will
find
that
your
supposedly
level
plot
is
knobby
with
hummocks
stand
directly
over
each
little
mound
swing
the
back
of
your
axe
vigorously
against
it
between
your
legs
nine
times
out
of
ten
it
will
crumble
and
the
tenth
time
means
merely
a
root
to
cut
or
a
stone
to
pry
out
at
length
you
are
possessed
of
a
plot
of
clean
fresh
earth
level
and
soft
free
from
projections
but
do
not
unpack
your
tent
lay
a
young
birch
or
maple
an
inch
or
so
in
diameter
across
a
log
two
clips
will
produce
you
a
if
you
are
inexperienced
and
cherish
memories
of
striped
lawn
marquees
you
will
cut
them
about
six
inches
long
if
you
are
wise
and
old
and
gray
in
woods
experience
you
will
multiply
that
length
by
four
then
your
loops
will
not
slip
off
and
you
will
have
a
real
grip
on
mother
earth
than
which
nothing
can
be
more
desirable
in
the
event
of
a
heavy
rain
and
wind
squall
about
midnight
if
your
axe
is
as
sharp
as
it
ought
to
be
you
can
point
them
more
neatly
by
holding
them
suspended
in
front
of
you
while
you
snip
at
their
ends
with
the
axe
rather
than
by
resting
them
against
a
solid
base
pile
them
together
at
the
edge
of
the
clearing
cut
a
crotched
sapling
eight
or
ten
feet
long
now
unpack
your
tent
in
a
wooded
country
you
will
not
take
the
time
to
fool
with
a
stout
line
run
through
the
eyelets
and
along
the
apex
will
string
it
successfully
between
your
two
trees
draw
the
line
as
tight
as
possible
but
do
not
be
too
unhappy
if
after
your
best
efforts
it
still
sags
a
little
that
is
what
your
long
crotched
stick
is
for
stake
out
your
four
corners
if
you
get
them
in
a
good
rectangle
and
in
such
relation
to
the
apex
as
to
form
two
isosceles
triangles
of
the
ends
your
tent
will
stand
smoothly
therefore
be
an
artist
and
do
it
right
once
the
four
corners
are
well
placed
the
rest
follows
naturally
occasionally
in
the
north
country
it
will
be
found
that
the
soil
is
too
thin
over
the
rocks
to
grip
the
in
that
case
drive
them
at
a
sharp
angle
as
deep
as
they
will
go
and
then
lay
a
large
flat
stone
across
the
slant
of
them
thus
anchored
you
will
ride
out
a
gale
finally
wedge
your
long
sapling
crotch
under
the
line
outside
the
tent
of
course
to
tighten
it
your
shelter
is
up
if
you
are
a
woodsman
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
has
sufficed
to
accomplish
all
this
there
remains
the
question
of
a
bed
and
you
better
attend
to
it
now
while
your
mind
is
still
occupied
with
the
shelter
problem
fell
a
good
thrifty
young
balsam
and
set
to
work
pulling
off
the
fans
those
you
can
not
strip
off
easily
with
your
hands
are
too
tough
for
your
purpose
lay
them
carelessly
crisscross
against
the
blade
of
your
axe
and
up
the
handle
they
will
not
drop
off
and
when
you
shoulder
that
axe
you
will
resemble
a
walking
haystack
and
will
probably
experience
a
genuine
emotion
of
surprise
at
the
amount
of
balsam
that
can
be
thus
transported
in
the
tent
lay
smoothly
one
layer
of
fans
convex
side
up
butts
toward
the
foot
now
thatch
the
rest
on
top
of
this
thrusting
the
butt
ends
underneath
the
layer
already
placed
in
such
a
manner
as
to
leave
the
fan
ends
curving
up
and
down
towards
the
foot
of
your
bed
your
second
emotion
of
surprise
will
assail
you
as
you
realize
how
much
spring
inheres
in
but
two
or
three
layers
thus
arranged
when
you
have
spread
your
rubber
blanket
you
will
be
possessed
of
a
bed
as
soft
and
a
great
deal
more
aromatic
and
luxurious
than
any
you
would
be
able
to
buy
in
town
your
next
care
is
to
clear
a
living
space
in
front
of
the
tent
this
will
take
you
about
twenty
seconds
for
you
need
not
be
particular
as
to
stumps
hummocks
or
small
brush
all
you
want
is
room
for
cooking
and
suitable
space
for
spreading
out
your
provisions
but
do
not
unpack
anything
yet
your
fireplace
you
will
build
of
two
green
logs
laid
side
by
side
the
fire
is
to
be
made
between
them
they
should
converge
slightly
in
order
that
the
utensils
to
be
rested
across
them
may
be
of
various
sizes
if
your
vicinity
yields
flat
stones
they
build
up
even
better
than
the
logs
unless
they
happen
to
be
of
granite
granite
explodes
most
disconcertingly
poles
sharpened
driven
upright
into
the
ground
and
then
pressed
down
to
slant
over
the
fireplace
will
hold
your
kettles
a
suitable
height
above
the
blaze
fuel
should
be
your
next
thought
a
roll
of
birch
bark
first
of
all
then
some
of
the
small
dry
resinous
branches
that
stick
out
from
the
trunks
of
pines
living
or
dead
finally
the
wood
itself
if
you
are
merely
cooking
supper
and
have
no
thought
for
a
or
a
i
should
advise
you
to
stick
to
the
dry
pine
branches
helped
out
in
the
interest
of
coals
for
frying
by
a
little
dry
maple
or
birch
if
you
need
more
of
a
blaze
you
will
have
to
search
out
fell
and
split
a
standing
dead
tree
this
is
not
at
all
necessary
i
have
travelled
many
weeks
in
the
woods
without
using
a
more
formidable
implement
than
a
hatchet
pile
your
fuel
a
complete
supply
all
you
are
going
to
need
by
the
side
of
your
already
improvised
fireplace
but
as
you
value
your
peace
of
mind
do
not
fool
with
matches
it
will
be
a
little
difficult
to
turn
your
mind
from
the
concept
of
fire
to
which
all
these
preparations
have
compellingly
led
it
especially
as
a
fire
is
the
one
cheerful
thing
your
weariness
needs
the
most
at
this
time
of
day
but
you
must
do
so
leave
everything
just
as
it
is
and
unpack
your
provisions
first
of
all
rinse
your
utensils
hang
your
with
the
proper
quantity
of
water
from
one
slanting
pole
and
your
kettle
from
the
other
salt
the
water
in
the
latter
receptacle
peel
your
potatoes
if
you
have
any
open
your
little
provision
sacks
puncture
your
tin
cans
if
you
have
any
slice
your
bacon
clean
your
fish
pluck
your
birds
mix
your
dough
or
batter
spread
your
table
tinware
on
your
tarpaulin
or
a
sheet
of
birch
bark
cut
a
see
that
everything
you
are
going
to
need
is
within
direct
reach
of
your
hand
as
you
squat
on
your
heels
before
the
fireplace
now
light
your
fire
the
civilized
method
is
to
build
a
fire
and
then
to
touch
a
match
to
the
completed
structure
if
well
done
and
in
a
grate
or
steve
this
works
beautifully
only
in
the
woods
you
have
no
grate
the
only
sure
way
is
as
follows
hold
a
piece
of
birch
bark
in
your
hand
shelter
your
match
all
you
know
how
when
the
bark
has
caught
lay
it
in
your
fireplace
assist
it
with
more
bark
and
gradually
build
up
twig
by
twig
stick
by
stick
from
the
first
of
flame
all
the
fire
you
are
going
to
need
it
will
not
be
much
the
little
hot
blaze
rising
between
the
parallel
logs
directly
against
the
aluminium
of
your
utensils
will
do
the
business
in
a
very
short
order
in
fifteen
minutes
at
most
your
meal
is
ready
and
you
have
been
able
to
attain
to
hot
food
thus
quickly
because
you
were
prepared
in
case
of
very
wet
weather
the
affair
is
altered
somewhat
if
the
rain
has
just
commenced
do
not
stop
to
clear
out
very
thoroughly
but
get
your
tent
up
as
quickly
as
possible
in
order
to
preserve
an
area
of
comparatively
dry
ground
but
if
the
earth
is
already
soaked
you
had
best
build
a
bonfire
to
dry
out
by
while
you
cook
over
a
smaller
fire
a
little
distance
removed
leaving
the
tent
until
later
or
it
may
be
well
not
to
pitch
the
tent
at
all
but
to
lay
it
across
slanting
supports
at
an
angle
to
reflect
the
heat
against
the
ground
it
is
no
joke
to
light
a
fire
in
the
rain
an
indian
can
do
it
more
easily
than
a
white
man
but
even
an
indian
has
more
trouble
than
the
acknowledge
you
will
need
a
greater
quantity
of
birch
bark
a
bigger
pile
of
resinous
dead
limbs
from
the
pine
trees
and
perhaps
the
heart
of
a
dead
pine
stub
or
stump
then
with
infinite
patience
you
may
be
able
to
tease
the
flame
sometimes
a
small
dead
birch
contains
in
the
waterproof
envelope
of
its
bark
a
species
of
powdery
dry
touchwood
that
takes
the
flame
readily
still
it
is
easy
enough
to
start
a
blaze
a
very
cheerful
healthy
blaze
the
difficulty
is
to
prevent
its
petering
out
the
moment
your
back
is
turned
but
the
depths
of
woe
are
sounded
and
the
limit
of
patience
reached
when
you
are
forced
to
get
breakfast
in
the
dripping
forest
after
the
chill
of
early
dawn
you
are
always
reluctant
in
the
best
of
circumstances
to
leave
your
blankets
to
fumble
with
numbed
fingers
for
matches
to
handle
cold
steel
and
slippery
fish
but
when
every
leaf
twig
sapling
and
tree
contains
a
douche
of
cold
water
when
the
wetness
oozes
about
your
moccasins
from
the
soggy
earth
with
every
step
you
take
when
you
look
about
you
and
realize
that
somehow
before
you
can
get
a
mouthful
to
banish
that
you
must
brave
cold
water
in
an
attempt
to
find
enough
fuel
to
cook
with
then
your
philosophy
and
early
religious
training
avail
you
little
the
first
times
you
are
forced
to
do
this
you
will
probably
squirm
circumspectly
through
the
bush
in
a
vain
attempt
to
avoid
shaking
water
down
on
yourself
you
will
resent
each
failure
to
do
so
and
at
the
end
your
rage
will
personify
the
wilderness
for
the
purpose
of
one
sweeping
anathema
the
hundredth
time
will
bring
you
wisdom
you
will
do
the
anathema
rueful
rather
than
enraged
from
the
tent
opening
then
you
will
plunge
boldly
in
and
get
wet
it
is
not
pleasant
but
it
has
to
be
done
and
you
will
save
much
temper
not
to
speak
of
time
dick
and
i
earned
our
diplomas
at
this
sort
of
work
it
rained
twelve
of
the
first
fourteen
days
we
were
out
towards
the
end
of
that
two
weeks
i
doubt
if
even
an
indian
could
have
discovered
a
dry
stick
of
wood
in
the
entire
country
the
land
was
of
laurentian
rock
formation
running
in
parallel
ridges
of
bare
stone
separated
by
hollows
carpeted
with
a
thin
layer
of
earth
the
ridges
were
naturally
to
camping
and
the
cup
hollows
speedily
filled
up
with
water
until
they
became
most
creditable
little
marshes
often
we
hunted
for
an
hour
or
so
before
we
could
find
any
sort
of
a
spot
to
pitch
our
tent
as
for
a
fire
it
was
a
matter
of
chopping
down
dead
trees
large
enough
to
have
remained
dry
inside
of
armfuls
of
birch
bark
and
of
the
patient
drying
out
by
repeated
ignition
of
enough
fuel
to
cook
very
simple
meals
of
course
we
could
have
kept
a
big
fire
going
easily
enough
but
we
were
travelling
steadily
and
had
not
the
time
for
that
in
these
trying
circumstances
dick
showed
that
no
matter
how
much
of
a
tenderfoot
he
might
be
he
was
game
enough
under
stress
but
to
return
to
our
pleasant
afternoon
while
you
are
consuming
the
supper
you
will
hang
over
some
water
to
heat
for
the
and
the
you
will
attend
to
the
moment
you
have
finished
eating
do
not
commit
the
fallacy
of
sitting
down
for
a
little
rest
better
finish
the
job
completely
while
you
are
about
it
you
will
appreciate
leisure
so
much
more
later
in
lack
of
a
you
will
find
that
a
bunch
of
tall
grass
bent
double
makes
an
ideal
swab
now
brush
the
flies
from
your
tent
drop
the
lining
and
enjoy
yourself
the
whole
task
from
first
to
last
has
consumed
but
a
little
over
an
hour
and
you
are
through
for
the
day
in
the
woods
as
nowhere
else
you
will
earn
your
leisure
only
by
forethought
make
no
move
until
you
know
it
follows
the
line
of
greatest
economy
to
putter
is
to
wallow
in
endless
desolation
if
you
can
not
move
directly
and
swiftly
and
certainly
along
the
line
of
least
resistance
in
everything
you
do
take
a
guide
with
you
you
are
not
of
the
woods
people
you
will
never
enjoy
doing
for
yourself
for
your
days
will
be
crammed
with
unending
labour
it
is
but
a
little
after
seven
the
long
crimson
shadows
of
the
north
country
are
lifting
across
the
aisles
of
the
forest
you
sit
on
a
log
or
lie
on
your
back
and
blow
contented
clouds
straight
up
into
the
air
nothing
can
disturb
you
now
the
wilderness
is
yours
for
you
have
taken
from
it
the
essentials
of
primitive
civilization
shelter
warmth
and
food
an
hour
ago
a
rainstorm
would
have
been
a
minor
catastrophe
now
you
do
not
care
blow
high
blow
low
you
have
made
for
yourself
an
so
that
the
signs
of
the
sky
are
less
important
to
you
than
to
the
city
dweller
who
wonders
if
he
should
take
an
umbrella
from
your
doorstep
you
can
look
placidly
out
on
the
great
unknown
the
noises
of
the
forest
draw
close
about
you
their
circle
of
mystery
but
the
circle
can
not
break
upon
you
for
here
you
have
conjured
the
homely
sounds
of
kettle
and
crackling
flame
to
keep
ward
thronging
down
through
the
twilight
steal
the
jealous
woodland
shadows
awful
in
the
sublimity
of
the
silent
places
but
at
the
sentry
outposts
of
your
firelit
trees
they
pause
like
wild
animals
hesitating
to
advance
the
wilderness
untamed
dreadful
at
night
is
all
about
but
this
one
little
spot
you
have
reclaimed
here
is
something
before
unknown
to
the
eerie
spirits
of
the
woods
as
you
sleepily
knock
the
ashes
from
the
pipe
you
look
about
on
the
familiar
scene
with
accustomed
satisfaction
you
are
at
home
on
lying
awake
at
night
who
hath
lain
alone
to
hear
the
wild
goose
cry
about
once
in
so
often
you
are
due
to
lie
awake
at
night
why
this
is
so
i
have
never
been
able
to
discover
it
apparently
comes
from
no
predisposing
uneasiness
of
indigestion
no
rashness
in
the
matter
of
too
much
tea
or
tobacco
no
excitation
of
unusual
incident
or
stimulating
conversation
in
fact
you
turn
in
with
the
expectation
of
rather
a
good
night
rest
almost
at
once
the
little
noises
of
the
forest
grow
larger
blend
in
the
hollow
bigness
of
the
first
drowse
your
thoughts
drift
idly
back
and
forth
between
reality
and
dream
when
you
are
broad
awake
perhaps
the
reservoir
of
your
vital
forces
is
full
to
the
overflow
of
a
little
waste
or
perhaps
more
subtly
the
great
mother
insists
thus
that
you
enter
the
temple
of
her
larger
mysteries
for
unlike
mere
insomnia
lying
awake
at
night
in
the
woods
is
pleasant
the
eager
nervous
straining
for
sleep
gives
way
to
a
delicious
indifference
you
do
not
care
your
mind
is
cradled
in
an
exquisite
of
judgment
and
of
thought
impressions
slip
vaguely
into
your
consciousness
and
as
vaguely
out
again
sometimes
they
stand
stark
and
naked
for
your
inspection
sometimes
they
lose
themselves
in
the
midst
of
always
they
lay
soft
velvet
fingers
on
the
drowsy
imagination
so
that
in
their
caressing
you
feel
the
vaster
spaces
from
which
they
have
come
your
faculties
receive
hearing
sight
smell
all
are
preternaturally
keen
to
whatever
of
sound
and
sight
and
woods
perfume
is
abroad
through
the
night
and
yet
at
the
same
time
active
appreciation
dozes
so
these
things
lie
on
it
sweet
and
cloying
like
fallen
rose
leaves
in
such
circumstance
you
will
hear
what
the
call
the
voices
of
the
rapids
many
people
never
hear
them
at
all
they
speak
very
soft
and
low
and
distinct
beneath
the
steady
roar
and
dashing
beneath
even
the
lesser
tinklings
and
gurglings
whose
quality
superimposes
them
over
the
louder
sounds
they
are
like
the
swimming
across
the
field
of
vision
which
disappear
so
quickly
when
you
concentrate
your
sight
to
look
at
them
and
which
reappear
so
magically
when
again
your
gaze
turns
vacant
in
the
stillness
of
your
hazy
they
speak
when
you
bend
your
attention
to
listen
they
are
gone
and
only
the
tumults
and
the
tinklings
remain
but
in
the
moments
of
their
audibility
they
are
very
distinct
just
as
often
an
odour
will
wake
all
a
vanished
memory
so
these
voices
by
the
force
of
a
large
impressionism
suggest
whole
scenes
far
off
are
the
of
chimes
and
the
murmur
of
a
multitude
so
that
subtly
you
feel
the
gray
old
town
with
its
walls
the
crowded
marketplace
the
decent
peasant
crowd
the
booths
the
mellow
church
building
with
its
bells
the
warm
sun
or
in
the
pauses
between
the
of
the
waters
sound
faint
and
clear
voices
singing
intermittently
calls
distant
notes
of
laughter
as
though
many
canoes
were
working
against
the
current
only
the
flotilla
never
gets
any
nearer
nor
the
voices
louder
the
call
these
mist
people
the
huntsmen
and
look
frightened
to
each
is
his
vision
according
to
his
experience
the
nations
of
the
earth
whisper
to
their
exiled
sons
through
the
voices
of
the
rapids
curiously
enough
by
all
reports
they
suggest
always
peaceful
scenes
a
harvest
field
a
street
fair
a
sunday
morning
in
a
cathedral
town
careless
travellers
never
the
turmoils
and
struggles
perhaps
this
is
the
great
mother
compensation
in
a
harsh
mode
of
life
nothing
is
more
fantastically
unreal
to
tell
about
nothing
more
concretely
real
to
experience
than
this
undernote
of
the
quick
water
and
when
you
do
lie
awake
at
night
it
is
always
making
its
unobtrusive
appeal
gradually
its
hypnotic
spell
works
the
distant
chimes
ring
louder
and
nearer
as
you
cross
the
borderland
of
sleep
and
then
outside
the
tent
some
little
woods
noise
snaps
the
thread
an
owl
hoots
a
whippoorwill
cries
a
twig
cracks
beneath
the
cautious
prowl
of
some
night
creature
at
once
the
yellow
sunlit
french
meadows
puff
away
you
are
staring
at
the
blurred
image
of
the
moon
spraying
through
the
texture
of
your
tent
the
voices
of
the
rapids
have
dropped
into
the
background
as
have
the
dashing
noises
of
the
stream
through
the
forest
is
a
great
silence
but
no
stillness
at
all
the
whippoorwill
swings
down
and
up
the
short
curve
of
his
regular
song
over
and
over
an
owl
says
his
rapid
these
with
the
ceaseless
dash
of
the
rapids
are
the
web
on
which
the
night
traces
her
more
delicate
embroideries
of
the
unexpected
distant
crashes
single
and
impressive
stealthy
footsteps
near
at
hand
the
subdued
scratching
of
claws
a
faint
sniff
sniff
of
inquiry
the
sudden
clear
of
the
little
owl
the
mournful
cry
of
the
loon
instinct
with
the
spirit
of
loneliness
the
ethereal
of
the
birds
of
passage
high
in
the
air
a
among
the
dead
leaves
immediately
stilled
and
then
at
the
last
from
the
thicket
close
at
hand
the
beautiful
silver
purity
of
the
sparrow
the
nightingale
of
the
north
trembling
with
the
ecstasy
of
beauty
as
though
a
shimmering
moonbeam
had
turned
to
sound
and
all
the
while
the
blurred
figure
of
the
moon
mounting
to
the
of
your
tent
these
things
combine
subtly
until
at
last
the
great
silence
of
which
they
are
a
part
overarches
the
night
and
draws
you
forth
to
contemplation
no
beverage
is
more
grateful
than
the
cup
of
spring
water
you
drink
at
such
a
time
no
moment
more
refreshing
than
that
in
which
you
look
about
you
at
the
darkened
forest
you
have
cast
from
you
with
the
warm
blanket
the
drowsiness
of
dreams
a
coolness
physical
and
spiritual
bathes
you
from
head
to
foot
all
your
senses
are
keyed
to
the
last
vibrations
you
hear
the
littler
night
prowlers
you
glimpse
the
greater
a
faint
searching
woods
perfume
of
dampness
greets
your
nostrils
and
somehow
mysteriously
in
a
manner
not
to
be
understood
the
forces
of
the
world
seem
in
suspense
as
though
a
touch
might
crystallize
infinite
possibilities
into
infinite
power
and
motion
but
the
touch
lacks
the
forces
hover
on
the
edge
of
action
unheeding
the
little
noises
in
all
humbleness
and
awe
you
are
a
dweller
of
the
silent
places
at
such
a
time
you
will
meet
with
adventures
one
night
we
put
fourteen
inquisitive
porcupines
out
of
camp
near
bay
i
discovered
in
the
large
grass
park
of
my
nine
deer
cropping
the
herbage
like
so
many
beautiful
ghosts
a
friend
tells
me
of
a
fawn
that
every
night
used
to
sleep
outside
his
tent
and
within
a
foot
of
his
head
probably
by
way
of
protection
against
wolves
its
mother
had
in
all
likelihood
been
killed
the
instant
my
friend
moved
toward
the
tent
opening
the
little
creature
would
disappear
and
it
was
always
gone
by
earliest
daylight
nocturnal
bears
in
search
of
pork
are
not
uncommon
but
even
though
your
interest
meets
nothing
but
the
bats
and
the
woods
shadows
and
the
stars
that
few
moments
of
the
sleeping
world
forces
is
a
psychical
experience
to
be
gained
in
no
other
way
you
can
not
know
the
night
by
sitting
up
she
will
sit
up
with
you
only
by
coming
into
her
presence
from
the
borders
of
sleep
can
you
meet
her
face
to
face
in
her
intimate
mood
the
night
wind
from
the
river
or
from
the
open
spaces
of
the
wilds
chills
you
after
a
time
you
begin
to
think
of
your
blankets
in
a
few
moments
you
roll
yourself
in
their
soft
wool
instantly
it
is
morning
and
strange
to
say
you
have
not
to
pay
by
going
through
the
day
unrefreshed
you
may
feel
like
turning
in
at
eight
instead
of
nine
and
you
may
fall
asleep
with
unusual
promptitude
but
your
journey
will
begin
proceed
springily
and
end
with
much
in
reserve
no
languor
no
dull
headache
no
exhaustion
follows
your
experience
for
this
once
your
two
hours
of
sleep
have
been
as
effective
as
nine
vi
the
do
you
know
the
chosen
water
where
the
ouananiche
is
waiting
dick
and
i
travelled
in
a
wooden
canoe
with
grub
duffel
tent
and
deuce
the
setter
dog
as
a
consequence
we
were
pretty
well
down
toward
the
for
we
had
not
realized
that
a
wooden
canoe
would
carry
so
little
weight
for
its
length
in
comparison
with
a
a
good
heavy
sea
we
could
ride
with
proper
management
and
a
little
baling
but
sloppy
waves
kept
us
busy
deuce
did
not
like
it
at
all
he
was
a
dog
old
in
the
wisdom
of
experience
it
had
taken
him
just
twenty
minutes
to
learn
all
about
canoes
after
a
single
tentative
trial
he
jumped
lightly
to
the
very
centre
of
his
place
with
the
lithe
caution
of
a
cat
then
if
the
water
happened
to
be
smooth
he
would
sit
gravely
on
his
haunches
or
would
rest
his
chin
on
the
gunwale
to
contemplate
the
passing
landscape
but
in
rough
weather
he
crouched
directly
over
the
keel
his
nose
between
his
paws
and
tried
not
to
dodge
when
the
cold
water
dashed
in
on
him
deuce
was
a
true
woodsman
in
that
respect
discomfort
he
always
bore
with
equanimity
and
he
must
often
have
been
very
cold
and
very
cramped
for
just
over
a
week
we
had
been
travelling
in
open
water
and
the
elements
had
not
been
kind
to
us
at
all
we
had
crept
up
under
points
had
weathered
the
rips
of
white
water
to
shelter
on
the
other
side
had
struggled
across
open
spaces
where
each
wave
was
singly
a
problem
to
fail
in
whose
solution
meant
instant
swamping
had
baled
and
schemed
and
figured
and
carried
and
sworn
and
tried
again
and
succeeded
with
about
two
cupfuls
to
spare
until
we
as
well
as
deuce
had
grown
a
little
tired
of
it
for
the
lust
of
travel
was
on
us
the
lust
of
travel
is
a
very
real
disease
it
usually
takes
you
when
you
have
made
up
your
mind
that
there
is
no
hurry
its
predisposing
cause
is
a
chart
or
map
and
its
main
symptom
is
the
feverish
delight
with
which
you
check
off
the
landmarks
of
your
journey
a
fair
wind
of
some
force
is
absolutely
fatal
with
that
at
your
back
you
can
not
stop
good
fishing
fine
scenery
interesting
bays
reputed
game
even
camps
where
friends
might
be
visited
all
pass
swiftly
astern
hardly
do
you
pause
for
lunch
at
noon
the
mad
joy
of
putting
country
behind
you
eats
all
other
interests
you
recover
only
when
you
have
come
to
your
journey
end
a
week
too
early
and
must
then
search
out
new
voyages
to
fill
in
the
time
all
this
morning
we
had
been
bucking
a
strong
north
wind
fortunately
the
shelter
of
a
string
of
islands
had
given
us
smooth
water
enough
but
the
heavy
gusts
sometimes
stopped
us
as
effectively
as
though
we
had
butted
solid
land
now
about
noon
we
came
to
the
last
island
and
looked
out
on
a
stretch
of
tumbling
seas
we
landed
the
canoe
and
mounted
a
high
rock
ca
make
it
like
this
said
i
i
take
the
outfit
over
and
land
it
and
come
back
for
you
and
the
dog
let
see
that
chart
we
hid
behind
the
rock
and
spread
out
the
map
four
miles
measured
dick
it
going
to
be
a
terror
we
looked
at
each
other
vaguely
suddenly
tired
we
ca
camp
here
at
this
time
of
day
objected
dick
to
our
unspoken
thoughts
and
then
the
map
gave
him
an
inspiration
here
a
little
river
ruminated
dick
that
goes
to
a
little
lake
and
then
there
another
little
river
that
flows
from
the
lake
and
comes
out
about
ten
miles
above
here
it
a
good
thirty
miles
i
objected
what
of
it
asked
dick
calmly
so
the
of
travel
broke
we
turned
to
the
right
behind
the
last
island
searched
out
the
opening
to
the
stream
and
paddled
serenely
and
philosophically
against
the
current
deuce
sat
up
and
yawned
with
a
mighty
satisfaction
we
had
been
bending
our
heads
to
the
demon
of
wind
our
ears
had
been
filled
with
his
shoutings
our
eyes
blinded
with
tears
our
breath
caught
away
from
us
our
muscles
strung
to
the
fiercest
endeavour
suddenly
we
found
ourselves
between
the
ranks
of
tall
forest
trees
bathed
in
a
warm
sunlight
gliding
like
a
feather
from
one
grassy
bend
to
another
of
the
laziest
little
stream
that
ever
hesitated
as
to
which
way
the
grasses
of
its
bed
should
float
as
for
the
wind
it
was
lost
somewhere
away
up
high
where
we
could
hear
it
muttering
to
itself
about
something
the
woods
leaned
over
the
fringe
of
bushes
cool
and
green
and
silent
occasionally
through
tiny
openings
we
caught
instant
impressions
of
straight
column
trunks
and
transparent
shadows
miniature
grass
marshes
jutted
out
from
the
bends
of
the
little
river
we
idled
along
as
with
a
homely
rustic
companion
through
the
aloofness
of
patrician
multitudes
every
bend
offered
us
charming
surprises
sometimes
a
muskrat
swam
hastily
in
a
pointed
furrow
of
ripple
vanishing
wings
barely
sensed
in
the
flash
left
us
staring
stealthy
withdrawals
of
creatures
whose
presence
we
realized
only
in
the
fact
of
those
withdrawals
snared
our
eager
interest
porcupines
rattled
and
rustled
importantly
and
regally
from
the
water
edge
to
the
woods
herons
ravens
an
occasional
duck
croaked
away
at
our
approach
thrice
we
surprised
eagles
once
a
canada
lynx
or
if
all
else
lacked
we
still
experienced
the
little
thrill
of
pleased
novelty
over
the
disclosure
of
a
group
of
silvery
birches
on
a
knoll
a
magnificent
white
pine
towering
over
the
beech
and
maple
forest
the
unexpected
aisle
of
a
long
straight
stretch
of
the
little
river
deuce
approved
thoroughly
he
stretched
himself
and
yawned
and
shook
off
the
water
and
glanced
at
me
with
doggy
and
set
himself
to
acquiring
a
conscientious
olfactory
knowledge
of
both
banks
of
the
river
i
do
not
doubt
he
knew
a
great
deal
more
about
it
than
we
did
porcupines
aroused
his
special
enthusiasm
incidentally
two
days
later
he
returned
to
camp
after
an
expedition
of
his
own
bristling
as
to
the
face
with
that
animal
barbed
weapons
thenceforward
his
interest
waned
we
ascended
the
charming
little
river
two
or
three
miles
at
a
sharp
bend
to
the
east
a
huge
sheet
of
rock
sloped
from
a
round
grass
knoll
sparsely
planted
with
birches
directly
down
into
a
pool
two
or
three
tree
trunks
jammed
directly
opposite
had
formed
a
sort
of
half
dam
under
which
the
water
lay
dark
a
tiny
grass
meadow
forty
feet
in
diameter
narrowed
the
stream
to
half
its
width
we
landed
dick
seated
himself
on
the
shelving
rock
i
put
my
together
deuce
disappeared
deuce
always
disappeared
whenever
we
landed
with
nose
down
hind
quarters
well
tucked
under
him
ears
flying
he
quartered
the
forest
at
high
speed
investigating
every
nook
and
cranny
of
it
for
the
radius
of
a
quarter
of
a
mile
when
he
has
quite
satisfied
himself
that
we
were
safe
for
the
moment
he
would
return
to
the
fire
where
he
would
lie
six
inches
of
pink
tongue
vibrating
with
breathlessness
beautiful
in
the
consciousness
of
virtue
dick
generally
sat
on
a
rock
and
thought
i
generally
fished
after
a
time
deuce
returned
i
gave
up
flies
spoons
phantom
minnows
artificial
frogs
and
crayfish
as
dick
continued
to
sit
on
the
rock
and
think
we
both
joined
him
the
sun
was
very
warm
and
grateful
and
i
am
sure
we
both
acquired
an
added
respect
for
dick
judgment
just
when
it
happened
neither
of
us
was
afterwards
able
to
decide
perhaps
deuce
knew
but
suddenly
as
often
a
figure
appears
in
a
cinematograph
the
diminutive
meadow
thirty
feet
away
contained
two
deer
they
stood
in
the
grass
wagging
their
little
tails
in
impatience
of
the
flies
look
a
there
stammered
dick
aloud
deuce
sat
up
on
his
haunches
i
started
for
my
camera
the
deer
did
not
seem
to
be
in
the
slightest
degree
alarmed
they
pointed
four
big
ears
in
our
direction
ate
a
few
leisurely
mouthfuls
of
grass
sauntered
to
the
stream
for
a
drink
of
water
wagged
their
little
tails
some
more
and
quietly
faded
into
the
cool
shadows
of
the
forest
illustration
at
such
a
time
you
will
meet
with
adventures
an
hour
later
we
ran
out
into
reeds
and
so
to
the
lake
it
was
a
pretty
lake
across
the
distance
we
made
out
a
moving
object
which
shortly
resolved
itself
into
a
birch
canoe
the
canoe
proved
to
contain
an
indian
an
indian
boy
of
about
ten
years
a
black
dog
and
a
bundle
when
within
a
few
rods
of
each
other
we
ceased
paddling
and
drifted
by
with
the
momentum
the
indian
was
a
man
of
about
forty
his
hair
bound
with
a
red
fillet
his
feet
incased
in
moccasins
but
otherwise
dressed
in
white
men
garments
he
smoked
a
short
pipe
and
contemplated
us
gravely
bo
jou
bo
jou
we
called
in
the
usual
north
country
salutation
bo
jou
bo
jou
he
replied
we
inquired
as
to
the
fishing
in
the
lake
he
assented
we
drifted
by
each
other
without
further
speech
when
the
decent
distance
of
etiquette
separated
us
we
resumed
our
paddles
i
produced
a
young
cable
terminated
by
a
tremendous
spoon
and
a
solid
brass
snell
as
thick
as
a
telegraph
wire
we
had
laid
in
this
formidable
implement
in
hopes
of
a
big
muscallunge
it
had
been
trailed
for
days
at
a
time
we
had
become
used
to
its
vibration
which
actually
seemed
to
communicate
itself
to
every
fibre
of
the
light
canoe
every
once
in
a
while
we
would
stop
with
a
jerk
that
would
nearly
snap
our
heads
off
then
we
would
know
we
had
hooked
the
american
continent
we
had
become
used
to
that
also
it
generally
happened
when
we
attempted
a
little
burst
of
speed
so
when
the
canoe
brought
up
so
violently
that
all
our
tinware
rolled
on
deuce
dick
was
merely
disgusted
there
she
goes
again
he
grumbled
you
hooked
canada
canada
held
quiescent
for
about
three
seconds
then
it
started
due
south
suffering
serpents
shrieked
dick
paddle
you
sulphurated
idiot
yelled
i
it
was
most
interesting
all
i
had
to
do
was
to
hang
on
and
try
to
stay
in
the
boat
dick
paddled
and
fumed
and
splashed
water
and
got
more
excited
canada
dragged
us
bodily
backward
then
canada
changed
his
mind
and
started
in
our
direction
i
was
plenty
busy
taking
in
slack
so
i
did
not
notice
dick
dick
was
absolutely
demented
his
mind
automatically
reacted
in
the
direction
of
paddling
he
paddled
blindly
frantically
canada
came
surging
in
his
mouth
open
his
wicked
eyes
flaming
a
tremendous
indistinct
body
lashing
foam
dick
glanced
once
over
his
shoulder
and
let
out
a
frantic
howl
you
got
the
he
shrieked
i
turned
to
fumble
for
the
pistol
we
were
headed
directly
for
a
log
stranded
on
shore
and
about
ten
feet
from
it
dick
i
yelled
in
warning
he
thrust
his
paddle
out
forward
just
in
time
the
stout
maple
bent
and
cracked
the
canoe
hit
with
a
bump
that
threw
us
forward
i
returned
to
the
young
cable
it
came
in
limp
and
slack
we
looked
at
each
other
sadly
no
use
sighed
dick
at
last
they
never
invented
the
words
and
we
upset
if
we
kicked
the
dog
i
had
the
end
of
the
line
in
my
hands
look
here
i
cried
that
thick
brass
wire
had
been
as
cleanly
bitten
through
as
though
it
had
been
cut
with
clippers
he
must
have
caught
sight
of
you
said
dick
lifted
up
his
voice
in
lamentation
you
had
four
feet
of
him
out
of
water
he
wailed
and
there
was
a
lot
more
if
you
had
kept
cool
said
i
severely
we
should
have
lost
him
you
do
want
to
get
rattled
in
an
emergency
there
no
sense
in
it
what
were
you
going
to
do
with
that
asked
dick
pointing
to
where
i
had
laid
the
pistol
i
was
going
to
shoot
him
in
the
head
i
replied
with
dignity
the
best
way
to
land
them
dick
laughed
disagreeably
i
looked
down
at
my
side
lay
our
largest
iron
spoon
we
skirted
the
side
of
the
lake
in
silence
far
out
from
shore
the
water
was
ruffled
where
the
wind
swept
down
but
with
us
it
was
as
still
and
calm
as
the
forest
trees
that
looked
over
into
it
after
a
time
we
turned
short
to
the
left
through
a
very
narrow
passage
between
two
marshy
shores
and
so
after
a
sharp
bend
of
but
a
few
hundred
feet
came
into
the
other
river
this
was
a
wide
stream
smoothly
hurrying
without
rapids
or
tumult
the
forest
had
drawn
to
either
side
to
let
us
pass
here
were
the
wilder
reaches
after
the
intimacies
of
the
little
river
across
stretches
of
marsh
we
could
see
an
occasional
great
blue
heron
standing
deep
long
strings
of
ducks
struggled
quacking
from
invisible
pools
the
faint
marsh
odour
saluted
our
nostrils
from
the
point
where
the
flashed
broadly
ruffling
in
the
wind
we
dropped
out
the
smaller
spoon
and
masterfully
landed
a
pickerel
even
deuce
brightened
he
cared
nothing
for
raw
fish
but
he
knew
their
possibilities
towards
evening
we
entered
the
hilly
country
and
so
at
the
last
turned
to
the
left
into
a
sand
cove
where
grew
maples
and
birches
in
beautiful
park
order
under
a
hill
there
we
pitched
camp
and
as
the
flies
lacked
built
a
about
which
to
forgather
when
the
day
was
done
dick
still
vocally
regretted
the
muscallunge
told
him
of
my
big
bear
one
day
late
in
the
summer
i
was
engaged
in
packing
some
supplies
along
an
old
fur
trail
north
of
lake
superior
i
had
accomplished
one
and
with
empty
straps
was
returning
to
the
cache
for
another
the
trail
at
one
point
emerged
into
and
crossed
an
open
park
some
hundreds
of
feet
in
diameter
in
which
the
grass
grew
to
the
height
of
the
knee
when
i
was
about
halfway
across
a
black
bear
arose
to
his
hind
legs
not
ten
feet
from
me
and
remarked
in
a
loud
tone
of
voice
now
if
a
man
were
to
say
to
you
unexpectedly
even
in
the
formality
of
an
italian
garden
or
the
accustomedness
of
a
city
street
you
would
be
somewhat
startled
so
i
went
to
camp
there
i
told
them
about
the
bear
i
tried
to
be
conservative
in
my
description
because
i
did
not
wish
to
be
accused
of
exaggeration
my
impression
of
the
animal
was
that
he
and
a
spruce
tree
that
grew
near
enough
for
ready
comparison
were
approximately
of
the
same
stature
we
returned
to
the
grass
park
after
some
difficulty
we
found
a
clear
footprint
it
was
a
little
larger
than
that
made
by
a
coon
so
you
see
i
admonished
didactically
that
lunge
probably
was
not
quite
so
large
as
you
thought
it
may
have
been
a
chinese
bear
said
dick
dreamily
a
chinese
lady
bear
of
high
degree
i
gave
him
up
vii
on
canoe
travelling
it
is
there
that
i
am
going
with
an
extra
hand
to
bail
her
just
one
single
loafer
that
i
know
he
can
take
his
chance
of
drowning
while
i
sail
and
sail
and
sail
her
for
the
red
gods
call
me
out
and
i
must
go
the
following
morning
the
wind
had
died
but
had
been
succeeded
by
a
heavy
pall
of
fog
after
we
had
felt
our
way
beyond
the
mouth
of
the
river
we
were
forced
to
paddle
by
north
in
blind
reliance
on
our
compass
sounds
there
were
none
involuntarily
we
lowered
our
voices
the
inadvertent
click
of
the
paddle
against
the
gunwale
seemed
to
desecrate
a
foreordained
stillness
occasionally
to
the
right
hand
or
the
left
we
made
out
faint
of
wooded
islands
that
endured
but
a
moment
and
then
deliberately
faded
into
whiteness
they
formed
on
the
view
exactly
as
an
image
develops
on
a
photographic
plate
sometimes
a
faint
of
tiny
waves
against
a
shore
nearer
than
it
seemed
cautioned
us
anew
not
to
break
the
silence
otherwise
we
were
alone
intruders
suffered
in
the
presence
of
a
brooding
nature
only
as
long
as
we
refrained
from
disturbances
then
at
noon
the
vapours
began
to
eddy
to
open
momentarily
in
revelation
of
vivid
green
glimpses
to
stream
down
the
rising
wind
pale
sunlight
dashed
fitfully
across
us
like
a
shower
somewhere
in
the
invisibility
a
duck
quacked
deuce
awoke
looked
about
him
and
in
doggish
relief
animals
understand
thoroughly
these
subtleties
of
nature
in
half
an
hour
the
sun
was
strong
the
air
clear
and
sparkling
and
a
freshening
wind
was
certifying
our
prognostications
of
a
lively
afternoon
a
light
canoe
will
stand
almost
anything
in
the
way
of
a
sea
although
you
may
find
it
impossible
sometimes
to
force
it
in
the
direction
you
wish
to
go
a
loaded
canoe
will
weather
a
great
deal
more
than
you
might
think
however
only
experience
in
balance
and
in
the
nature
of
waves
will
bring
you
safely
across
a
stretch
of
whitecaps
with
the
sea
dead
ahead
you
must
not
go
too
fast
otherwise
you
will
dip
water
over
the
bow
you
must
trim
the
craft
absolutely
on
an
even
keel
otherwise
the
comb
of
the
wave
too
light
to
lift
you
will
slop
in
over
one
gunwale
or
the
other
you
must
be
perpetually
watching
your
chance
to
gain
a
foot
or
so
between
the
heavier
seas
with
the
sea
over
one
bow
you
must
paddle
on
the
leeward
side
when
the
canoe
mounts
a
wave
you
must
allow
the
crest
to
throw
the
bow
off
a
trifle
but
the
moment
it
starts
down
the
other
slope
you
must
twist
your
paddle
sharply
to
regain
the
direction
of
your
course
the
careening
tendency
of
this
twist
you
must
counteract
by
a
corresponding
twist
of
your
body
in
the
other
direction
then
the
hollow
will
allow
you
two
or
three
strokes
wherewith
to
assure
a
little
progress
the
double
twist
at
the
very
crest
of
the
wave
must
be
very
delicately
performed
or
you
will
ship
water
the
whole
length
of
your
craft
with
the
sea
abeam
you
must
simply
paddle
straight
ahead
the
adjustment
is
to
be
accomplished
entirely
by
the
poise
of
the
body
you
must
prevent
the
capsize
of
your
canoe
when
clinging
to
the
angle
of
a
wave
by
leaning
to
one
side
the
crucial
moment
of
course
is
that
during
which
the
peak
of
the
wave
slips
under
you
in
case
of
a
breaking
comber
thrust
the
flat
of
your
paddle
deep
in
the
water
to
prevent
an
upset
and
lean
well
to
leeward
thus
presenting
the
side
and
half
the
bottom
of
the
canoe
to
the
shock
of
water
your
recovery
must
be
instant
however
if
you
lean
a
second
too
long
over
you
go
this
sounds
more
difficult
than
it
is
after
a
time
you
do
it
instinctively
as
a
skater
balances
with
the
sea
over
the
quarter
you
have
merely
to
take
care
that
the
waves
do
not
slue
you
around
sidewise
and
that
the
canoe
does
not
dip
water
on
one
side
or
the
other
under
the
stress
of
your
twists
with
the
paddle
dead
astern
is
perhaps
the
most
difficult
of
all
for
the
reason
that
you
must
watch
both
gunwales
at
once
and
must
preserve
an
absolutely
even
keel
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
it
generally
requires
your
utmost
strength
to
steer
in
really
heavy
weather
one
man
only
can
do
any
work
the
other
must
be
content
to
remain
passenger
and
he
must
be
trained
to
absolute
immobility
no
matter
how
dangerous
a
careen
the
canoe
may
take
no
matter
how
much
good
cold
water
may
pour
in
over
his
legs
he
must
resist
his
tendency
to
shift
his
weight
the
entire
issue
depends
on
the
delicacy
of
the
steersman
adjustments
so
he
must
be
given
every
chance
the
main
difficulty
rests
in
the
fact
that
such
canoeing
is
a
good
deal
like
travel
there
is
not
much
opportunity
to
learn
by
experience
in
a
run
across
an
open
bay
you
will
encounter
somewhat
over
a
thousand
waves
no
two
of
which
are
exactly
alike
and
any
one
of
which
can
fill
you
up
only
too
easily
if
it
is
not
correctly
met
your
experience
is
called
on
to
solve
instantly
and
practically
a
thousand
problems
no
in
which
to
recover
is
permitted
you
between
them
at
the
end
of
the
four
hours
you
awaken
to
the
fact
that
your
eyes
are
strained
from
intense
concentration
and
that
you
taste
copper
probably
nothing
however
can
more
effectively
wake
you
up
to
the
last
fibre
of
your
physical
intellectual
and
nervous
being
you
are
filled
with
an
exhilaration
every
muscle
strung
tight
answers
immediately
and
accurately
to
the
slightest
hint
you
quiver
all
over
with
restrained
energy
your
mind
thrusts
behind
you
the
problem
of
the
last
wave
as
soon
as
solved
and
leaps
with
insistent
eagerness
to
the
next
you
attain
that
superordinary
condition
when
your
faculties
react
instinctively
like
a
machine
it
is
a
species
of
intoxication
after
a
time
you
personify
each
wave
you
grapple
with
it
as
with
a
personal
adversary
you
exult
as
beaten
and
broken
it
hisses
away
to
leeward
go
it
you
son
of
a
gun
you
shout
ah
you
would
would
you
think
you
can
do
you
and
in
the
roar
and
rush
of
wind
and
water
you
crouch
like
a
boxer
on
the
defence
parrying
the
blows
but
ready
at
the
slightest
opening
to
gain
a
stroke
of
the
paddle
in
such
circumstances
you
have
not
the
leisure
to
consider
distance
you
are
too
busily
engaged
in
slaughtering
waves
to
consider
your
rate
of
progress
the
fact
that
slowly
you
are
pulling
up
on
your
objective
point
does
not
occur
to
you
until
you
are
within
a
few
hundred
yards
of
it
then
unless
you
are
careful
you
are
undone
probably
the
most
difficult
thing
of
all
to
learn
is
that
the
waves
to
be
encountered
in
the
last
hundred
yards
of
an
open
sweep
are
exactly
as
dangerous
as
those
you
dodged
so
fearfully
four
miles
from
shore
you
are
so
nearly
in
that
you
unconsciously
relax
your
efforts
calmly
almost
contemptuously
a
big
roller
rips
along
your
gunwale
you
are
wrecked
fortunately
within
easy
swimming
distance
but
that
save
your
duffel
remember
this
be
just
as
careful
with
the
very
last
wave
as
you
were
with
the
others
get
inside
before
you
draw
that
deep
breath
of
relief
strangely
enough
in
sports
where
it
would
seem
that
convention
would
rest
practically
at
the
zero
point
the
bugbear
of
good
form
although
mashed
and
disguised
rises
up
to
confuse
the
directed
practicality
the
average
man
is
wedded
to
his
theory
he
has
seen
a
thing
done
in
a
certain
way
and
he
not
only
always
does
it
that
way
himself
but
he
is
positively
unhappy
at
seeing
any
one
else
employing
a
different
method
from
the
swing
at
golf
to
the
manner
of
lighting
a
match
in
the
wind
this
truism
applies
i
remember
once
hearing
a
long
argument
with
an
eastern
man
on
the
question
of
the
english
in
the
western
country
your
method
is
all
very
well
said
the
westerner
for
where
it
came
from
in
england
they
ride
to
hunt
so
they
need
a
light
saddle
and
very
short
stirrups
set
well
forward
that
helps
them
in
jumping
but
it
is
most
awkward
out
here
you
want
your
stirrups
very
long
and
directly
under
you
so
your
legs
hang
loose
and
you
depend
on
your
balance
and
the
grip
of
your
thighs
not
your
knees
it
is
less
tiring
and
better
sense
and
infinitely
more
graceful
for
it
more
nearly
approximates
the
bareback
seat
instead
of
depending
on
stirrups
you
are
part
of
the
horse
you
follow
his
every
movement
and
as
for
your
rising
trot
i
like
to
see
you
accomplish
it
safely
on
our
mountain
trails
where
the
trot
is
the
only
gait
practicable
unless
you
take
for
ever
to
get
anywhere
to
all
of
which
the
easterner
found
no
rebuttal
except
the
to
him
entirely
efficient
plea
that
his
own
method
was
good
form
now
of
course
it
is
very
pleasant
to
do
things
always
accurately
according
to
the
rules
of
the
game
and
if
you
are
out
merely
for
sport
perhaps
it
is
as
well
to
stick
to
them
but
utility
is
another
matter
personally
i
do
not
care
at
all
to
kill
trout
unless
by
the
fly
but
when
we
need
meat
and
they
do
not
need
flies
i
never
hesitate
to
offer
them
any
kind
of
they
may
fancy
i
have
even
at
a
pinch
clubbed
them
to
death
in
a
shallow
pool
time
will
come
in
your
canoe
experience
when
you
will
pull
into
shelter
half
full
of
water
when
you
will
be
glad
of
the
fortuity
of
a
chance
to
help
you
out
when
sheer
blind
luck
or
main
strength
and
awkwardness
will
be
the
only
reasons
you
can
honestly
give
for
an
arrival
and
a
battered
and
dishevelled
arrival
at
that
do
not
therefore
repine
or
bewail
your
awkwardness
or
indulge
in
undue
of
tenderfoot
method
is
nothing
the
arrival
is
the
important
thing
you
are
travelling
and
if
you
can
make
time
by
nearly
swamping
yourself
or
by
dragging
your
craft
across
a
point
or
by
taking
any
other
base
advantage
of
the
game
formality
by
all
means
do
so
deuce
used
to
solve
the
problem
of
comfort
by
drinking
the
little
pool
of
cold
water
in
which
he
sometimes
was
forced
to
lie
in
the
woods
when
a
thing
is
to
be
done
do
not
consider
how
you
have
done
it
or
how
you
have
seen
it
done
or
how
you
think
it
ought
to
be
done
but
how
it
be
accomplished
absolute
fluidity
of
expedient
perfect
adaptability
is
worth
a
dozen
volumes
of
theoretical
knowledge
if
you
ca
talk
goes
the
western
expression
raise
a
yell
if
you
ca

you

signs
wave
a

and
do
not
be
too
ready
to
take
advice
as
to
what
you
can
or
can
not
accomplish
even
from
the
woods
people
of
course
the
woods
indians
or
the
know
all
about
canoes
and
you
would
do
well
to
listen
to
them
but
the
mere
fact
that
your
interlocutor
lives
in
the
forest
while
you
normally
inhabit
the
towns
does
not
necessarily
give
him
authority
a
community
used
to
horses
looks
with
horror
on
the
instability
of
all
water
craft
less
solid
than
canal
boats
canoemen
stand
in
awe
of
the
bronco
the
fishermen
of
the
georgian
bay
accustomed
to
venture
out
with
their
open
sailboats
in
weather
that
forces
the
big
lake
schooners
to
shelter
know
absolutely
nothing
about
canoes
dick
and
i
made
an
run
from
the
fox
island
to
killarney
in
a
trifling
sea
to
be
cheered
during
our
stay
at
the
latter
place
by
doleful
predictions
of
an
early
drowning
and
this
from
a
seafaring
community
it
knew
all
about
boats
it
knew
nothing
about
canoes
and
yet
the
unthinking
might
have
been
influenced
by
the
advice
of
these
men
simply
because
they
had
been
brought
up
on
the
water
the
point
is
obvious
do
not
attempt
a
thing
unless
you
are
sure
of
yourself
but
do
not
relinquish
it
merely
because
some
one
else
is
not
sure
of
you
the
best
way
to
learn
is
with
a
keep
near
shore
and
try
everything
do
attempt
the
real
thing
until
your
handling
in
a
heavy
sea
has
become
as
instinctive
as
or
the
steps
of
dancing
remain
on
the
hither
side
of
caution
when
you
start
out
act
at
first
as
though
every
wavelet
would
surely
swamp
you
extend
the
scope
of
your
operations
very
gradually
until
you
know
just
what
you
can
do
get
careless
never
take
any
chances
all
viii
the
stranded
strangers
as
we
progressed
the
country
grew
more
and
more
solemnly
aloof
in
the
southland
is
a
certain
appearance
of
mobility
lent
by
the
deciduous
trees
the
warm
sun
the
intimate
nooks
in
which
grow
the
commoner
homely
weeds
and
flowers
the
abundance
of
bees
and
musical
insects
the
childhood
familiarity
of
the
birds
even
the
pleasantly
fickle
aspects
of
the
skies
but
the
north
wraps
itself
in
a
mantle
of
awe
great
hills
rest
not
so
much
in
the
stillness
of
sleep
as
in
the
calm
of
a
mighty
comprehension
the
pines
rank
after
rank
file
after
file
are
always
trooping
somewhere
up
the
slope
to
pause
at
the
crest
before
descending
on
the
other
side
into
the
unknown
bodies
of
water
exactly
of
the
size
shape
and
general
appearance
we
are
accustomed
to
see
dotted
with
pleasure
craft
and
bordered
with
wharves
summer
cottages
pavilions
and
hotels
accentuate
by
that
very
fact
a
solitude
that
harbours
only
a
pair
of
weirdly
laughing
loons
like
the
hills
these
lakes
are
lying
in
a
deep
still
repose
but
a
repose
that
somehow
suggests
the
comprehending
calm
of
those
behind
the
veil
the
whole
country
seems
to
rest
in
a
suspense
of
waiting
a
shot
breaks
the
stillness
for
an
instant
but
its
very
memory
is
shadowy
a
moment
after
the
echoes
die
inevitably
the
traveller
feels
thrust
in
upon
himself
by
a
neutrality
more
deadly
than
open
hostility
would
be
hostility
at
least
supposes
recognition
of
his
existence
a
rousing
of
forces
to
oppose
him
this
ignores
one
can
no
longer
wonder
at
the
taciturnity
of
the
men
who
dwell
here
nor
does
one
fail
to
grasp
the
eminent
suitability
to
the
country
of
its
indian
name
the
silent
places
even
the
birds
joyful
lively
commonplace
little
people
that
they
are
draw
some
of
this
aloofness
to
themselves
the
north
is
full
of
the
homelier
singers
a
dozen
species
of
warblers
lisp
phrases
two
or
three
sparrows
whistle
a
cheerful
repertoire
the
nuthatches
and
chickadees
toot
away
in
blissful
and
yet
somehow
that
very
circumstance
thrusts
the
imaginative
voyager
outside
the
companionship
of
their
friendliness
in
the
face
of
the
great
gods
they
move
with
accustomed
familiarity
somehow
they
possess
in
their
little
experience
that
which
explains
the
mystery
so
that
they
no
longer
stand
in
its
awe
their
everyday
lives
are
spent
under
the
shadow
of
the
temple
whither
you
dare
not
bend
your
footsteps
the
intimacy
of
occult
things
isolates
also
these
wise
little
birds
the
north
speaks
however
only
in
the
voices
of
three
the
two
thrushes
and
the
sparrow
you
must
hear
these
each
at
his
proper
time
the
hermit
thrush
you
will
rarely
see
but
late
some
afternoon
when
the
sun
is
lifting
along
the
trunks
of
the
hardwood
forest
if
you
are
very
lucky
and
very
quiet
you
will
hear
him
far
in
the
depth
of
the
blackest
swamps
musically
expressed
his
song
is
very
much
like
that
of
the
wood
thrush
three
cadenced
liquid
notes
a
quivering
pause
then
three
more
notes
of
another
phrase
and
so
on
but
the
fineness
of
its
quality
makes
of
it
an
entirely
different
performance
if
you
symbolize
the
hermit
thrush
by
the
flute
you
must
call
the
wood
thrush
a
chime
of
little
tinkling
bells
one
is
a
rendition
the
other
the
essence
of
liquid
music
an
effect
of
richness
of
depth
going
down
to
the
very
soul
of
things
a
haunting
suggestion
of
having
touched
very
near
to
the
source
of
tears
a
conviction
that
the
just
interpretation
of
the
song
would
be
an
equally
just
interpretation
of
black
woods
deep
shadows
cloistered
sunlight
brooding
hills
these
are
the
subtle
and
elusive
impressions
you
will
receive
in
the
middle
of
the
ancient
forest
the
thrush
you
will
enjoy
after
your
day
work
is
quite
finished
you
will
see
him
through
the
tobacco
haze
perched
on
a
limb
against
the
evening
sky
he
utters
a
loud
joyful
pauses
for
the
attention
he
thus
solicits
and
then
deliberately
runs
up
five
mellow
double
notes
ending
with
a
metallic
chee
chee
chee
that
sounds
as
though
it
had
been
struck
on
a
triangle
then
a
silence
of
exactly
nine
seconds
and
repeat
as
regularly
as
this
performance
goes
on
time
him
as
often
as
you
will
you
can
never
convict
him
of
a
second
variation
and
he
is
so
optimistic
and
willing
and
his
notes
are
so
golden
with
the
yellow
of
sunshine
the
sparrow
sings
nine
distinct
variations
of
the
same
song
he
may
sing
more
but
that
is
all
i
have
counted
he
inhabits
woods
brulés
and
clearings
ordinarily
he
is
cheerful
and
occasionally
aggravating
one
man
i
knew
he
drove
nearly
crazy
to
that
man
he
was
always
saying
he
never
heard
the
man
say
drink
and
toward
the
last
my
friend
used
wildly
to
offer
him
a
thousand
dollars
if
he
would
if
he
only
finish
that
sentence
but
occasionally
in
just
the
proper
circumstances
he
forgets
his
stump
corners
his
vines
his
jolly
sunlight
and
his
delightful
bugs
to
become
the
intimate
voice
of
the
wilds
it
is
night
very
still
very
dark
the
subdued
murmur
of
the
forest
ebbs
and
flows
with
the
voices
of
the
furtive
folk
an
undertone
fearful
to
break
the
night
calm
suddenly
across
the
dusk
of
silence
flashes
a
single
thread
of
silver
vibrating
trembling
with
some
unguessed
ecstasy
of
emotion
poor
canada
canada
canada
canada
it
mourns
passionately
and
falls
silent
that
is
all
you
will
hear
at
various
times
other
birds
peculiarly
of
the
north
loons
alternately
calling
and
uttering
their
maniac
laughter
purple
finches
or
some
of
the
pine
sparrows
warbling
high
and
clear
the
winter
wren
whose
rapturous
ravings
never
fail
to
strike
the
attention
of
the
dullest
passer
all
these
are
exclusively
northern
voices
and
each
expresses
some
phase
or
mood
of
the
silent
places
but
none
symbolizes
as
do
the
three
and
when
first
you
hear
one
of
them
after
an
absence
you
are
satisfied
that
things
are
right
in
the
world
for
the
north
country
spirit
is
as
it
was
now
ensued
a
spell
of
calm
weather
with
a
film
of
haze
over
the
sky
the
water
lay
like
quicksilver
heavy
and
inert
toward
afternoon
it
became
opalescent
the
very
substance
of
the
liquid
itself
seemed
impregnated
with
dyes
ranging
in
shade
from
wine
colour
to
the
most
delicate
lilac
through
a
smoke
veil
the
sun
hung
a
ball
of
red
while
beneath
every
island
every
rock
every
tree
every
wild
fowl
floating
idly
in
a
medium
apparently
too
delicate
for
its
support
lurked
the
beautiful
crimson
shadows
of
the
north
illustration
each
wave
was
singly
a
problem
to
fail
in
whose
solution
meant
instant
swamping
hour
after
hour
day
after
day
we
slipped
on
point
after
point
island
after
island
presented
itself
silently
to
our
inspection
and
dropped
quietly
astern
the
beat
of
paddles
fitted
monotonously
into
the
almost
portentous
stillness
it
seemed
that
we
might
be
able
to
go
on
thus
for
ever
lapped
in
the
dream
of
some
forgotten
magic
that
had
stricken
breathless
the
life
of
the
world
and
then
suddenly
three
weeks
on
our
journey
we
came
to
a
town
it
was
not
the
typical
fur
town
of
the
far
north
but
it
lay
at
the
threshold
a
single
street
worn
smooth
by
the
feet
of
men
and
dogs
but
innocent
of
hoofs
fronted
the
channel
a
board
walk
elevated
against
the
snows
bordered
a
row
of
whitewashed
log
and
frame
houses
each
with
its
garden
of
brilliant
flowers
a
dozen
wharves
of
various
sizes
over
whose
edges
peeped
the
double
masts
of
mackinaw
boats
spoke
of
a
fishing
community
between
the
roofs
one
caught
glimpses
of
a
low
sparse
woods
and
some
hills
beyond
we
subsequently
added
the
charm
of
isolation
in
learning
that
the
nearest
telegraph
line
was
fifteen
miles
distant
while
the
railroad
passed
some
fifty
miles
away
dick
immediately
went
wild
it
was
his
first
glimpse
of
the
mixed
peoples
a
dozen
loungers
handsome
careless
graceful
with
the
inimitable
elegance
of
the
leisure
chatted
rolled
cigarettes
and
surveyed
with
indolence
such
of
the
town
as
could
be
viewed
from
the
shade
in
which
they
lay
three
girls
in
whose
dark
cheeks
glowed
a
rich
french
comeliness
were
comparing
purchases
near
the
store
a
group
of
rivermen
reckless
of
air
with
their
little
round
hats
over
one
ear
sat
outside
the
hotel
across
the
dividing
fences
of
two
of
the
blazoned
gardens
a
pair
of
old
crones
gossiped
under
their
breaths
some
indians
smoked
silently
at
the
edge
of
one
of
the
docks
in
the
distance
of
the
street
end
a
french
priest
added
the
quaintness
of
his
cassock
to
the
exotic
atmosphere
of
the
scene
at
once
a
pack
of
the
fierce
left
their
foraging
for
the
offal
of
the
fisheries
to
bound
challenging
in
the
direction
of
poor
deuce
that
highbred
animal
fruitlessly
attempted
to
combine
dignity
with
a
discretionary
lurking
between
our
legs
we
made
demonstrations
with
sticks
and
sought
out
the
hotel
for
it
was
about
time
to
eat
we
had
supper
at
a
table
with
three
forest
rangers
two
and
a
handsome
breed
whose
business
did
not
appear
then
we
lit
up
and
strolled
about
to
see
what
we
could
see
on
the
text
of
a
pair
of
brass
knuckles
hanging
behind
the
hotel
bar
i
embroidered
many
experiences
with
the
lumberjack
i
told
of
a
wisconsin
town
where
an
enforced
wait
of
five
hours
enabled
me
to
establish
the
proportion
of
fourteen
saloons
out
of
a
total
of
twenty
frame
buildings
i
descanted
craftily
on
the
character
of
the
woodsman
out
of
the
woods
and
in
the
right
frame
of
mind
for
deviltry
i
related
how
jack
boyd
irritated
beyond
endurance
at
the
annoyances
of
a
stranger
finally
with
the
flat
of
his
hand
boxed
the
man
head
so
mightily
that
he
whirled
around
twice
and
sat
down
now
said
jack
softly
be
more
careful
my
friend
or
next
time
you
or
of
a
little
irishman
who
shouted
to
his
friends
about
to
pull
a
big
man
from
pounding
the
life
quite
out
of
him
let
him
alone
let
him
alone
i
may
be
on
top
myself
in
a
few
minutes
and
of
dave
walker
who
fought
to
a
standstill
with
his
bare
fists
alone
five
men
who
had
sworn
to
kill
him
and
again
of
that
doughty
knight
of
the
peavie
who
when
attacked
by
an
axe
waved
aside
interference
with
the
truly
dauntless
cry
leave
him
be
boys
there
an
axe
between
us
i
tried
to
sketch
too
the
drive
wherein
a
dozen
times
in
an
hour
these
men
face
death
with
a
smile
or
a
curse
the
raging
untamed
river
the
fierce
rush
of
the
logs
the
cool
little
human
beings
poising
with
a
certain
contemptuous
preciosity
on
the
edge
of
destruction
as
they
herd
their
brutish
multitudes
there
was
jimmy
the
river
boss
who
could
not
swim
a
stroke
and
who
was
incontinently
swept
over
a
dam
and
into
the
boiling
of
the
eddy
below
three
times
gasping
strangling
drowning
he
was
carried
in
the
wide
swirl
of
the
circle
sometimes
under
sometimes
on
top
then
his
knee
touched
a
and
he
dragged
himself
painfully
ashore
he
coughed
up
a
quantity
of
water
and
gave
vent
to
his
feelings
over
a
miraculous
escape
damn
it
all
he
wailed
i
lost
my
peavie
on
the
paint
river
drive
one
spring
said
i
a
jam
formed
that
extended
up
river
some
three
miles
the
men
were
working
at
the
breast
of
it
some
underneath
some
on
top
after
a
time
the
jam
apparently
broke
pulled
downstream
a
hundred
feet
or
so
and
plugged
again
then
it
was
seen
that
only
a
small
section
had
moved
leaving
the
main
body
still
jammed
so
that
between
the
two
sections
lay
a
narrow
stretch
of
open
water
into
this
open
water
one
of
the
men
had
fallen
before
he
could
recover
the
second
or
tail
section
of
the
jam
started
to
pull
apparently
nothing
could
prevent
him
from
being
crushed
a
man
called
sam
i
do
know
his
last
name
ran
down
the
tail
of
the
first
section
across
the
loose
logs
bobbing
in
the
open
water
seized
the
victim
of
the
accident
by
the
collar
desperately
scaled
the
face
of
the
moving
jam
and
reached
the
top
just
as
the
two
sections
ground
together
with
the
brutish
noise
of
wrecking
timbers
it
was
a
magnificent
rescue
any
but
these
men
of
iron
would
have
adjourned
for
thanks
and
congratulations
still
retaining
his
hold
on
the
other
man
collar
sam
twisted
him
about
and
delivered
a
vigorous
kick
damn
you
said
he
that
was
all
they
fell
to
work
at
once
to
keep
the
jam
moving
i
instanced
too
some
of
the
feats
of
these
men
could
perform
of
how
jack
boyd
has
been
known
to
float
twenty
miles
without
shifting
his
feet
on
a
log
so
small
that
he
carried
it
to
the
water
on
his
shoulder
of
how
a
dozen
rivermen
one
after
the
other
would
often
go
through
the
chute
of
a
dam
standing
upright
on
single
logs
of
who
could
turn
a
somersault
on
a
floating
pine
log
of
the
birling
matches
wherein
two
men
on
a
single
log
try
to
throw
each
other
into
the
river
by
treading
squirrel
fashion
in
faster
and
faster
rotation
of
how
a
riverman
and
spiked
boots
and
a
can
do
more
work
than
an
ordinary
man
with
a
rowboat
i
do
not
suppose
dick
believed
all
this
although
it
was
strictly
and
literally
true
but
his
imagination
was
impressed
he
gazed
with
respect
on
the
group
at
the
far
end
of
the
street
where
fifteen
or
twenty
were
interested
in
some
amusement
concealed
from
us
what
do
you
suppose
they
are
doing
murmured
dick
awestricken
wrestling
or
boxing
or
gambling
or
jumping
said
i
we
approached
gravely
silently
intensely
interested
the
spikeshod
dangerous
men
were
playing
croquet
the
sight
was
too
much
for
our
nerves
we
went
away
the
permanent
inhabitants
of
the
place
we
discovered
to
be
friendly
to
a
degree
the
indian
strain
was
evident
in
various
dilution
through
all
enthusiasm
grew
steadily
until
his
artistic
instincts
became
aggressive
and
he
flatly
announced
his
intention
of
staying
at
least
four
days
for
the
purpose
of
making
sketches
we
talked
the
matter
over
finally
it
was
agreed
deuce
and
i
were
to
make
a
wide
circle
to
the
north
and
west
as
far
as
the
hudson
bay
post
of
cloche
while
dick
filled
his
notebook
that
night
we
slept
in
beds
for
the
first
time
that
is
to
say
we
slept
until
about
three
then
we
became
vaguely
conscious
through
a
haze
of
drowse
as
one
becomes
conscious
in
the
pause
of
a
of
voices
outside
our
doors
some
one
said
something
about
its
being
hardly
much
use
to
go
to
bed
another
hoped
the
sheets
were
not
damp
a
succession
of
lights
twinkled
across
the
walls
of
our
room
and
were
vaguely
explained
by
the
coughing
of
a
steamboat
we
sank
into
oblivion
until
the
brought
us
to
our
feet
i
happened
to
finish
my
toilet
a
little
before
dick
and
so
descended
to
the
sunlight
until
he
might
be
ready
roosting
on
a
gray
old
boulder
ten
feet
outside
the
door
were
two
figures
that
made
me
want
to
rub
my
eyes
the
older
was
a
square
man
of
sixty
with
neatly
trimmed
whiskers
he
had
on
a
soft
alpine
hat
of
pearl
gray
a
modishly
cut
gray
homespun
suit
a
tie
in
which
glimmered
an
opal
pin
wore
tan
gloves
and
had
slung
over
one
shoulder
by
a
narrow
black
strap
a
pair
of
the
younger
was
a
tall
and
angular
young
fellow
of
an
eager
and
sophomoric
youth
his
hair
was
very
light
and
very
smoothly
brushed
his
eyes
blue
and
rather
his
complexion
pink
with
an
obviously
recent
and
superficial
sunburn
and
his
clothes
from
the
white
panama
to
the
low
shoes
of
the
latest
cut
and
material
instinctively
i
sought
his
fraternity
pin
he
looked
as
though
he
might
say
rah
rah
something
or
other
a
camera
completed
his
outfit
tourists
how
in
the
world
did
they
get
here
and
then
i
remembered
the
twinkle
of
the
lights
and
the
coughing
of
the
steamboat
but
what
in
time
could
they
be
doing
here
picturesque
as
the
place
was
it
held
nothing
to
appeal
to
the
baedeker
spirit
i
surveyed
the
pair
with
some
interest
i
suppose
there
is
pretty
good
fishing
around
here
ventured
the
elder
he
evidently
took
me
for
an
inhabitant
remembering
my
faded
blue
shirt
and
my
floppy
old
hat
and
the
red
handkerchief
about
my
neck
and
the
moccasins
on
my
feet
i
did
not
blame
him
i
suppose
there
are
bass
among
the
islands
i
replied
we
fell
into
conversation
i
learned
that
he
and
his
son
were
from
new
york
he
learned
by
a
final
direct
question
which
was
most
significant
of
his
not
belonging
to
the
country
who
i
was
by
chance
he
knew
my
name
he
opened
his
heart
we
came
down
on
the
of
said
he
my
son
and
i
are
on
a
vacation
we
have
been
as
far
as
the
yellowstone
and
thought
we
would
like
to
see
some
of
this
country
i
was
assured
that
on
this
date
i
could
make
connection
with
the
for
the
south
i
told
the
purser
of
the
not
to
wake
us
up
unless
the
was
here
at
the
docks
he
bundled
us
off
here
at
three
in
the
morning
the
was
not
here
it
is
an
outrage
he
uttered
various
threats
i
thought
the
was
running
away
south
around
the
perry
sound
region
i
suggested
yes
but
she
was
to
begin
june
to
make
this
connection
he
produced
a
railroad
folder
it
in
this
he
continued
did
you
go
by
that
thing
i
marvelled
why
of
course
said
he
i
forgot
you
were
an
american
said
i
you
in
canada
now
he
looked
his
bewilderment
so
i
hunted
up
dick
i
detailed
the
situation
he
does
know
the
race
i
concluded
soon
he
will
be
trying
to
get
information
out
of
the
agent
let
be
on
hand
we
were
on
hand
the
tourist
his
face
very
red
his
whiskers
very
white
and
bristly
marched
importantly
to
the
agent
office
the
latter
comprised
also
the
the
fish
depot
and
a
general
store
the
agent
was
for
the
moment
dickering
two
pounds
of
sugar
this
transaction
took
five
minutes
to
the
pound
mr
tourist
waited
then
he
opened
up
the
agent
heard
him
placidly
as
one
who
listens
to
a
curious
tale
what
i
want
to
know
is
where
that
boat
ended
the
tourist
could
say
replied
the
agent
are
you
the
agent
of
this
company
sure
replied
the
agent
then
why
do
you
know
something
about
its
business
and
plans
and
intentions
could
say
replied
the
agent
do
you
think
it
would
be
any
good
to
wait
for
the
do
you
suppose
they
can
be
coming
do
you
suppose
they
altered
the
schedule
could
say
replied
the
agent
when
is
the
next
boat
through
here
i
listened
for
the
answer
in
trepidation
for
i
saw
that
another
could
say
would
cause
the
tourist
to
blow
up
to
my
relief
the
agent
merely
inquired
north
or
south
south
of
course
i
just
came
from
the
north
what
in
the
name
of
everlasting
blazes
should
i
want
to
go
north
again
for
could
say
replied
the
agent
the
next
boat
south
gets
in
next
week
tuesday
or
wednesday
next
week
shrieked
the
tourist
when
the
next
boat
north
interposed
the
son
morning
what
time
could
say
you
have
to
watch
for
her
that
our
boat
dad
said
the
young
man
but
we
just
from
there
snorted
his
father
three
hundred
miles
back
it
put
us
behind
two
days
i
got
to
be
in
new
york
friday
i
got
an
engagement
he
turned
suddenly
to
the
agent
here
i
got
to
send
a
telegram
the
agent
blinked
placidly
you
not
send
it
from
here
this
ai
a
telegraph
station
where
the
nearest
station
fifteen
mile
without
further
parley
the
old
man
turned
and
walked
stiff
and
military
from
the
place
near
the
end
of
the
broad
walk
he
met
the
usual
doddering
but
amiable
oldest
inhabitant
fine
day
chirped
the
patriarch
in
friendliness
they
jest
brought
in
a
bear
cub
over
to
antoine
if
you
like
to
take
a
look
at
him
i
show
you
where
it
is
the
tourist
stopped
short
and
glared
fiercely
sir
said
he
damn
your
bear
then
he
strode
on
leaving
grandpa
staring
after
him
in
the
course
of
the
morning
we
became
quite
well
acquainted
and
he
resigned
the
son
appeared
to
take
somewhat
the
humorous
view
all
through
the
affair
which
must
have
irritated
the
old
gentleman
they
discussed
it
rather
thoroughly
and
finally
decided
to
retrace
their
steps
for
a
fresh
start
over
a
route
this
settled
the
senior
seemed
to
feel
relieved
of
a
weight
he
even
saw
and
relished
certain
funny
phases
of
the
incident
though
he
never
ceased
to
foretell
different
kinds
of
trouble
for
the
company
varying
in
range
from
mere
complaints
to
the
most
tremendous
of
damage
suits
he
was
much
interested
finally
in
our
methods
of
travel
and
then
in
logical
sequence
with
what
he
could
see
about
him
he
watched
curiously
my
loading
of
the
canoe
for
i
had
a
stretch
of
open
water
and
the
wind
was
abroad
deuce
empirical
boat
wisdom
aroused
his
admiration
he
and
his
son
were
both
at
the
shore
to
see
me
off
deuce
settled
himself
in
the
bottom
i
lifted
the
stern
from
the
shore
and
gently
set
it
afloat
in
a
moment
i
was
ready
to
start
wait
a
minute
wait
a
minute
suddenly
cried
the
father
i
swirled
my
paddle
back
the
old
gentleman
was
hastily
fumbling
in
his
pockets
after
an
instant
he
descended
to
the
water
edge
here
said
he
you
are
a
judge
of
fiction
take
this
it
was
his
steamboat
and
railway
folder
ix
on
flies
all
the
rest
of
the
day
i
paddled
under
the
frowning
cliffs
of
the
hill
ranges
bold
bare
scarred
seamed
with
fissures
their
precipice
rocks
gave
the
impression
of
ten
thousand
feet
rather
that
only
so
many
hundreds
late
in
the
afternoon
we
landed
against
a
formation
of
basaltic
blocks
cut
as
squarely
up
and
down
as
a
dock
and
dropping
off
into
as
deep
water
the
waves
sullenly
against
them
and
the
fringe
of
a
dark
pine
forest
drawn
back
from
a
breadth
of
natural
grass
lowered
across
the
horizon
like
a
deuce
and
i
made
camp
with
the
uneasy
feeling
of
being
under
inimical
inspection
a
cold
wind
ruffled
waters
no
comfort
was
in
the
prospect
so
we
retired
early
then
it
appeared
that
the
coarse
grass
of
the
park
had
bred
innumerable
black
flies
and
that
we
had
our
work
cut
out
for
us
the
question
of
flies
using
that
to
a
woodsman
eminently
connotive
word
in
its
wide
embracement
of
mosquitoes
sandflies
black
flies
and
midges
is
one
much
mooted
in
the
craft
on
no
subject
are
more
widely
divergent
ideas
expressed
one
writer
claims
that
black
flies
bites
are
but
the
temporary
inconvenience
of
a
another
tells
of
boils
lasting
a
week
as
the
invariable
result
of
their
attentions
a
third
sweeps
aside
the
whole
question
as
unimportant
to
concentrate
his
anathemas
on
the
musical
mosquito
still
a
fourth
descants
on
the
maddening
midge
and
is
prepared
to
defend
his
claims
against
the
world
a
like
dogmatic
partisanship
obtains
in
the
question
of
defences
each
and
every
man
possessed
of
a
tongue
wherewith
to
speak
or
a
pen
wherewith
to
write
heralds
the
particular
merits
of
his
own
or
eager
advocates
of
the
advantages
of
pork
fat
kerosene
pine
tar
pennyroyal
oil
of
cloves
castor
oil
lollacapop
or
a
half
hundred
other
concoctions
will
assure
you
tears
in
eyes
that
his
is
the
only
true
faith
so
many
men
so
many
minds
until
the
theorist
is
confused
into
doing
the
most
uncomfortable
thing
possible
that
is
to
learn
by
experience
as
for
the
truth
it
is
at
once
in
all
of
them
and
in
none
of
them
the
annoyance
of
from
a
sting
depends
entirely
on
the
individual
physical
makeup
some
people
are
so
poisoned
by
mosquito
bites
that
three
or
four
on
the
forehead
suffice
to
close
entirely
the
victim
eyes
on
others
they
leave
but
a
small
red
mark
without
swelling
black
flies
caused
festering
sores
on
one
man
i
accompanied
to
the
woods
in
my
own
case
they
leave
only
a
tiny
the
size
of
a
which
bothers
me
not
a
bit
midges
nearly
drove
crazy
the
same
companion
of
mine
so
that
finally
he
jumped
into
the
river
clothes
and
all
to
get
rid
of
them
again
merely
my
own
experience
would
lead
me
to
regard
them
as
a
tremendous
nuisance
but
one
quite
bearable
indians
are
less
susceptible
than
whites
nevertheless
i
have
seen
them
badly
swelled
behind
the
ears
from
the
bites
of
the
big
hardwood
mosquito
you
can
make
up
your
mind
to
one
thing
from
the
first
warm
weather
until
august
you
must
expect
to
cope
with
insect
pests
the
black
fly
will
keep
you
busy
until
late
afternoon
the
midges
will
swarm
you
about
sunset
and
the
mosquito
will
preserve
the
tradition
after
you
have
turned
in
as
for
the
and
others
of
his
piratical
breed
he
will
bite
like
a
dog
at
any
time
to
me
the
most
annoying
species
is
the
mosquito
the
black
fly
is
sometimes
most
industrious
i
have
seen
trout
fishermen
come
into
camp
with
the
blood
literally
streaming
from
their
faces
but
his
great
recommendation
is
that
he
holds
still
to
be
killed
no
frantic
slaps
no
waving
of
arms
no
muffled
curses
you
just
place
your
finger
calmly
and
firmly
on
the
spot
you
get
him
every
time
in
this
is
great
joy
it
may
be
unholy
joy
perhaps
even
vengeful
but
it
leaves
the
spirit
ecstatic
the
satisfaction
of
the
beast
that
has
had
the
nerve
to
light
on
you
just
as
you
are
reeling
in
almost
counterbalances
the
pain
of
a
sting
the
midge
again
or
punkie
or
just
as
you
please
swarms
down
upon
you
suddenly
and
with
commendable
vigour
so
that
you
feel
as
though
pepper
were
being
sprinkled
on
your
bare
skin
and
his
invisibility
and
intangibility
are
such
that
you
can
never
tell
whether
you
have
killed
him
or
not
but
he
does
last
long
and
dope
routs
him
totally
your
mosquito
however
is
such
a
deliberate
brute
he
has
in
him
some
of
that
divine
fire
which
causes
a
dog
to
turn
around
nine
times
before
lying
down
whether
he
is
selecting
or
gloating
i
do
not
know
but
i
do
maintain
that
the
price
of
your
life
blood
is
often
not
too
great
to
pay
for
the
cessation
of
that
hum
eet
is
not
hees
bite
said
billy
the
to
me
once
eet
is
hees
sing
i
agree
with
billy
one
mosquito
in
a
tent
can
keep
you
awake
for
hours
as
to
protection
it
is
varied
enough
in
all
conscience
and
always
theoretically
perfect
a
falling
well
down
over
your
chest
or
even
tied
under
your
is
at
once
the
simplest
and
most
fallacious
of
these
theories
it
will
keep
vast
numbers
of
flies
out
to
be
sure
it
will
also
keep
the
few
adventurous
discoverers
in
where
you
can
neither
kill
nor
eject
likewise
you
are
deprived
of
your
pipe
and
the
common
homely
comfort
of
spitting
on
your
bait
is
totally
denied
you
the
landscape
takes
on
the
prismatic
colours
of
refraction
so
that
while
you
can
easily
make
out
red
white
and
blue
chinese
dragons
and
mythological
monsters
you
are
unable
to
discover
the
more
welcome
succulence
say
of
a
partridge
on
a
limb
and
the
end
of
that
is
to
be
picked
to
holes
by
the
brush
and
finally
to
be
snatched
from
you
to
sapling
height
whence
your
pains
will
rescue
it
only
in
a
useless
condition
probably
then
you
will
dance
the
of
exasperation
on
its
dismembered
remains
still
there
are
times
in
case
of
river
paddling
or
open
walking
or
lengthened
waiting
when
the
net
is
a
great
comfort
and
it
is
easily
included
in
the
pack
next
in
order
come
the
various
dopes
and
they
are
various
from
the
stickiest
blackest
pastes
to
the
silkiest
suavest
oils
they
range
through
the
grades
of
essence
salve
and
cream
every
man
has
his
own
recipe
the
infallible
as
a
general
rule
it
may
be
stated
that
the
thicker
kinds
last
longer
and
are
generally
more
thoroughly
effective
but
the
lighter
are
pleasanter
to
wear
though
requiring
more
frequent
application
at
a
pinch
ordinary
pork
fat
is
good
the
indians
often
make
temporary
use
of
the
broad
caribou
leaf
crushing
it
between
their
palms
and
rubbing
the
juices
on
the
skin
i
know
by
experience
that
this
is
effective
but
very
transitory
it
is
however
a
good
thing
to
use
when
resting
on
the
trail
for
by
the
grace
of
providence
flies
are
rarely
bothersome
as
long
as
you
are
moving
at
a
fair
gait
this
does
not
always
hold
good
however
any
more
than
the
best
is
always
effective
i
remember
most
vividly
the
first
day
of
a
return
journey
from
the
shores
of
the
hudson
bay
the
weather
was
rather
oppressively
close
and
overcast
we
had
paddled
a
few
miles
up
river
from
the
fur
and
then
had
landed
in
order
to
lighten
the
canoe
for
the
ascent
against
the
current
at
that
point
the
forest
has
already
begun
to
dwindle
towards
the
land
of
little
sticks
so
that
often
miles
and
miles
of
open
muskegs
will
intervene
between
groups
of
the
stunted
trees
jim
and
i
found
ourselves
a
little
over
waist
deep
in
luxuriant
and
tangled
grasses
that
impeded
and
clogged
our
every
footstep
never
shall
i
forget
that
country
its
sad
and
lonely
isolation
its
dull
lead
sky
its
silence
and
the
closeness
of
its
stifling
atmosphere
and
never
shall
i
see
it
otherwise
than
as
in
a
dense
brown
haze
a
haze
composed
of
swarming
millions
of
mosquitoes
there
is
not
the
slightest
exaggeration
in
the
statement
at
every
step
new
multitudes
rushed
into
our
faces
to
join
the
old
at
times
jim
back
was
so
covered
with
them
that
they
almost
overlaid
the
colour
of
the
cloth
and
as
near
as
we
could
see
every
square
foot
of
the
thousands
of
acres
quartered
its
hordes
we
doped
liberally
but
without
the
slightest
apparent
effect
probably
two
million
squeamish
mosquitoes
were
driven
away
by
the
disgust
of
our
medicaments
but
what
good
did
that
do
us
when
eight
million
others
were
not
so
particular
at
the
last
we
hung
bandanas
under
our
hats
cut
fans
of
leaves
and
stumbled
on
through
a
most
miserable
day
until
we
could
build
a
smudge
at
evening
for
smoke
is
usually
a
specific
not
always
however
some
midges
seem
to
delight
in
it
the
indians
make
a
tiny
blaze
of
birch
bark
and
pine
twigs
deep
in
a
nest
of
grass
and
caribou
leaves
when
the
flame
is
well
started
they
twist
the
growing
vegetation
above
it
in
that
manner
they
gain
a
few
minutes
of
dense
acrid
smoke
which
is
enough
for
an
indian
a
white
man
however
needs
something
more
elaborate
the
chief
reason
for
your
initial
failure
in
making
an
effective
smudge
will
be
that
you
will
not
get
your
fire
well
started
before
piling
on
the
damp
it
need
not
be
a
conflagration
but
it
should
be
bright
and
glowing
so
that
the
punk
birch
or
maple
wood
you
add
will
not
smother
it
entirely
after
it
is
completed
you
will
not
have
to
sit
coughing
in
the
thick
of
fumigation
as
do
many
but
only
to
leeward
and
underneath
your
hat
used
as
a
fan
will
eddy
the
smoke
temporarily
into
desirable
nooks
and
crevices
i
have
slept
without
annoyance
on
the
great
plains
where
the
mosquitoes
seem
to
go
in
organized
and
predatory
bands
merely
by
lying
beneath
a
smudge
that
passed
at
least
five
feet
above
me
you
will
find
the
a
handy
brazier
for
the
accommodation
of
a
movable
smoke
to
be
transported
to
the
interior
of
the
tent
and
it
does
not
in
the
least
hurt
the
these
be
hints
briefly
spoken
out
of
which
at
times
you
may
have
to
construct
elaborate
campaigns
but
you
come
to
grapples
in
the
defence
of
comfort
when
night
approaches
if
you
can
eat
and
sleep
well
you
can
stand
almost
any
hardship
the
night
rest
is
as
carefully
to
be
as
the
food
that
sustains
you
no
precaution
is
too
elaborate
to
certify
unbroken
repose
by
dark
you
will
discover
the
peak
of
your
tent
to
be
liberally
speckled
with
insects
of
all
sorts
especially
is
this
true
of
an
evening
that
threatens
rain
your
may
drive
away
the
mosquitoes
but
merely
stupefies
the
other
varieties
you
are
forced
to
the
manipulation
of
a
balsam
fan
in
your
use
of
this
simple
implement
you
will
betray
the
extent
of
your
experience
dick
used
at
first
to
begin
at
the
rear
peak
and
brush
as
rapidly
as
possible
toward
the
opening
the
flies
thoroughly
aroused
eddied
about
a
few
frantic
moments
like
leaves
in
an
autumn
wind
finally
to
settle
close
to
the
sod
in
the
crannies
between
the
and
the
ground
then
dick
would
lie
flat
on
his
belly
in
order
to
brush
with
equal
vigour
at
these
new
the
flies
repeated
the
effect
and
returned
to
the
rear
peak
this
was
amusing
to
me
and
furnished
the
flies
with
healthful
appetizing
exercise
but
was
bad
for
dick
soul
after
a
time
he
discovered
the
only
successful
method
is
the
gentle
one
then
he
began
at
the
peak
and
brushed
forward
slowly
very
very
slowly
so
that
the
limited
intellect
of
his
visitors
did
not
become
confused
thus
when
they
arrived
at
the
opening
they
saw
it
and
used
it
instead
of
searching
frantically
for
corners
in
which
to
hide
from
apparently
vengeful
destruction
then
he
would
close
his
securely
and
turn
in
at
once
so
he
was
able
to
sleep
until
earliest
daylight
at
that
time
the
mosquitoes
again
found
him
out
nine
out
of
ten
perhaps
out
of
a
hundred
sleep
in
open
tents
for
absolute
and
perfect
comfort
proceed
as
follows
have
your
sew
you
a
tent
of
with
the
same
dimensions
as
your
shelter
except
that
the
walls
should
be
loose
and
voluminous
at
the
bottom
it
should
have
no
openings
footnote
do
not
allow
yourself
to
be
talked
into
substituting
or
bobinet
any
mesh
coarser
than
will
prove
pregnable
to
the
most
enterprising
of
the
smaller
species
suspend
this
affair
inside
your
tent
by
means
of
cords
or
tapes
drop
it
about
you
spread
it
out
lay
or
rocks
along
its
lower
edges
to
keep
it
spread
you
will
sleep
beneath
it
like
a
child
in
winter
no
driving
out
of
reluctant
flies
no
enforced
early
rising
no
danger
of
a
single
overlooked
insect
to
make
the
midnight
miserable
the
weighs
almost
nothing
can
be
looped
up
out
of
the
way
in
the
daytime
admits
the
air
readily
nothing
could
fill
the
soul
with
more
ecstatic
satisfaction
than
to
lie
for
a
moment
before
going
to
sleep
listening
to
a
noise
outside
like
an
sawmill
that
indicates
the
are
abroad
it
would
be
unfair
to
leave
the
subject
without
a
passing
reference
to
its
effect
on
the
imagination
we
are
all
familiar
with
comic
paper
mosquito
stories
and
some
of
them
are
very
good
but
until
actual
experience
takes
you
by
the
hand
and
leads
you
into
the
realm
of
pure
fancy
you
will
never
know
of
what
improvisation
the
human
mind
is
capable
the
picture
rises
before
my
mind
of
the
cabin
of
a
just
before
the
dawn
of
a
midsummer
day
the
sloop
was
made
for
business
and
the
cabin
harmonized
exactly
with
the
sloop
painted
pine
wooden
bunks
without
mattresses
slung
up
because
all
the
floor
place
had
been
requisitioned
for
sleeping
purposes
we
were
anchored
a
hundred
feet
off
land
from
pilot
cove
on
the
uninhabited
north
shore
the
mosquitoes
had
adventured
on
the
deep
we
lay
half
asleep
on
the
middle
rafter
murmured
the
football
man
is
one
old
fellow
giving
signals
a
quartette
is
singing
on
my
nose
muttered
the
glee
club
man
we
wo
need
to
cook
i
suggested
somnolently
we
can
run
up
and
down
on
deck
with
our
mouths
open
and
get
enough
for
breakfast
the
fourth
member
opened
one
eye
boys
he
breathed
we
wo
be
able
to
go
on
unless
we
give
up
having
any
more
biscuits
after
a
time
some
one
murmured
why
we
have
to
use
all
the
lard
on
the
mast
they
so
mad
because
they
ca
get
at
us
that
they
biting
the
mast
it
already
swelled
up
as
big
as
a
barrel
we
never
be
able
to
get
the
mainsail
up
any
of
you
boys
got
any
vaseline
perhaps
a
little
but
we
snored
vigorously
in
unison
the
indians
say
that
when
manitou
had
created
men
he
was
dissatisfied
and
so
brought
women
into
being
at
once
began
and
then
as
now
the
couples
sought
solitude
for
their
exchanges
of
vows
their
sighings
to
the
moon
their
claspings
of
hands
marriages
ensued
the
situation
remained
unchanged
life
was
one
perpetual
honeymoon
i
suppose
the
novelty
was
fresh
and
the
sexes
had
not
yet
realized
they
would
not
part
as
abruptly
as
they
had
been
brought
together
the
villages
were
deserted
while
the
woods
and
bushes
were
populous
with
wedded
and
unwedded
lovers
manitou
looked
on
the
proceedings
with
disapproval
all
this
was
most
romantic
and
beautiful
no
doubt
but
in
the
meantime
the
corn
the
rice
grew
rank
and
uncultivated
while
the
lynx
and
swingwáage
the
wolverine
and
the
wolf
committed
unchecked
depredations
among
the
weaker
forest
creatures
the
business
of
life
was
being
sadly
neglected
so
kitch
manitou
took
counsel
with
himself
and
created
the
mosquito
to
whom
he
gave
as
dwelling
the
woods
and
bushes
that
took
the
romance
out
of
the
situation
as
my
narrator
grimly
expressed
it
him
come
back
go
to
work
certainly
it
should
be
most
effective
even
the
moose
is
not
exempt
from
discomfort
at
certain
seasons
the
canoe
voyager
in
the
far
north
will
run
upon
a
dozen
in
the
course
of
a
day
travel
standing
in
the
river
merely
to
escape
the
insect
pests
however
this
is
to
be
remembered
after
the
first
of
august
they
bother
very
little
before
that
time
the
campaign
i
have
outlined
is
effective
even
in
fly
season
the
worst
days
are
infrequent
in
the
woods
you
must
expect
to
pay
a
certain
price
in
discomfort
for
a
very
real
and
very
deep
pleasure
wet
heat
cold
hunger
thirst
difficult
travel
insects
hard
beds
aching
muscles
all
these
at
one
time
or
another
will
be
your
portion
if
you
are
of
the
class
that
can
not
have
a
good
time
unless
everything
is
right
with
it
stay
out
of
the
woods
one
thing
at
least
will
always
be
wrong
when
you
have
gained
the
faculty
of
ignoring
the
one
disagreeable
thing
and
concentrating
your
powers
on
the
compensations
then
you
will
have
become
a
true
woodsman
and
to
your
desires
the
forest
will
always
be
calling
cloche
imagine
a
lake
like
a
starfish
nested
among
rugged
laurentian
hills
whose
brows
are
bare
and
forbidding
but
whose
concealed
ravines
harbour
each
its
cool
screen
of
forest
growth
imagine
a
brawling
stream
escaping
at
one
of
the
arms
to
tumble
intermittently
visible
among
the
trees
down
a
series
of
cascades
and
rapids
to
the
broad
calm
of
the
big
lake
imagine
a
meadow
at
the
mouth
of
this
stream
and
on
the
meadow
a
single
white
dot
thus
you
will
see
cloche
a
of
the
honourable
the
hudson
bay
company
as
deuce
and
i
saw
it
from
the
summit
of
the
hills
we
had
accomplished
a
very
hard
scramble
which
started
well
enough
in
a
ravine
so
leafy
and
green
and
impenetrable
that
we
might
well
have
imagined
ourselves
in
a
boundless
forest
deuce
had
scented
sundry
partridges
which
he
had
pointed
with
entire
deference
to
the
good
form
of
a
sporting
dog
conventions
as
usual
to
deuce
surprise
and
disgust
the
birds
had
proved
themselves
most
uncultivated
and
rude
persons
by
hopping
promptly
into
trees
instead
of
lying
to
point
and
then
flushing
as
a
partridge
should
i
had
refused
to
pull
pistol
on
them
deuce
heart
was
broken
then
finally
we
came
to
cliffs
up
which
we
had
to
scale
and
boulders
which
we
had
to
climb
and
fissures
which
we
had
to
jump
or
cross
on
fallen
trees
and
wide
bare
sweeps
of
rock
and
blueberry
bushes
which
we
had
to
cover
until
at
last
we
stood
where
we
could
look
all
ways
at
once
the
starfish
thrust
his
insinuating
arms
in
among
the
distant
hills
to
the
north
league
after
league
rising
and
falling
and
rising
again
into
ever
bluer
distance
mysterious
other
ranges
and
systems
lifted
until
at
last
far
out
nearly
at
the
of
my
eye
flashed
again
the
gleam
of
water
and
so
the
starfish
arms
of
the
little
lake
at
my
feet
seemed
to
have
plunged
into
this
wilderness
tangle
only
to
reappear
at
greater
distance
like
it
lured
the
imagination
always
on
and
on
and
on
through
the
secret
waterways
of
the
uninhabited
north
it
was
as
though
i
stood
on
the
dividing
ridge
between
the
old
and
the
new
through
the
southern
haze
hull
down
i
thought
to
make
out
the
smoke
of
a
great
lake
freighter
from
the
shelter
of
a
distant
cove
i
was
not
surprised
a
moment
later
to
see
emerge
a
tiny
speck
whose
movements
betrayed
it
as
a
birch
canoe
the
great
north
was
at
this
the
most
southern
of
the
hudson
bay
posts
striking
a
of
contact
with
the
world
of
men
deuce
and
i
angled
down
the
mountain
toward
the
stream
our
arrival
coincided
with
that
of
the
canoe
it
was
of
the
ojibway
pattern
and
contained
a
packs
a
with
whom
deuce
at
once
opened
guarded
negotiations
an
old
indian
a
squaw
and
a
child
of
six
or
eight
we
exchanged
brief
greetings
then
i
sat
on
a
stump
and
watched
the
portage
these
were
evidently
woods
indians
an
entirely
different
article
from
the
post
indians
they
wore
their
hair
long
and
bound
by
a
narrow
strip
or
fillet
their
faces
were
hard
and
deeply
lined
with
a
fine
bold
look
to
the
eyes
which
comes
only
from
long
woods
dwelling
they
walked
even
under
heavy
loads
with
a
sagging
springy
gait
at
once
and
swift
instead
of
the
man
used
his
sash
and
the
woman
a
blanket
knotted
loosely
together
at
the
ends
the
details
of
their
costumes
were
interesting
in
combination
of
jeans
and
buckskin
broadcloth
and
blanket
stroud
and
a
material
evidently
made
from
the
strong
white
sacking
in
which
flour
intended
for
frontier
consumption
is
always
packed
after
the
first
bo
jou
bo
jou
they
paid
no
further
attention
to
me
in
a
few
moments
the
portage
was
completed
the
woman
thrust
her
paddle
against
the
stream
bottom
and
the
canoe
and
so
embarked
the
man
stepped
smoothly
to
his
place
like
a
cat
leaping
from
a
chair
they
shot
away
with
the
current
leaving
behind
them
a
strange
and
mysterious
impression
of
silence
i
followed
down
a
narrow
but
trail
and
so
at
the
end
of
a
came
to
the
meadow
and
the
post
of
cloche
the
building
itself
was
accurately
of
the
hudson
bay
type
a
steep
sloping
roof
greater
in
front
than
behind
a
deep
recessed
veranda
squared
logs
sheathed
with
whitewashed
boards
about
it
was
a
little
garden
which
besides
the
usual
flowers
and
vegetables
contained
such
exotics
as
a
deer
confined
to
a
pen
and
a
bear
chained
to
a
stake
as
i
approached
the
door
opened
and
the
trader
came
out
now
often
along
the
southern
fringe
your
hudson
bay
trader
will
prove
to
be
a
distinct
disappointment
in
fact
one
of
the
historic
old
posts
is
now
kept
by
a
pert
little
cockney
englishman
cringing
or
impudent
as
the
main
chance
seems
to
advise
when
you
have
penetrated
further
into
the
wilderness
however
where
the
hardships
of
winter
and
summer
travel
the
loneliness
of
winter
posts
the
necessity
of
dealing
directly
with
savage
men
and
savage
nature
develops
the
quality
of
a
man
or
wrecks
him
early
in
the
game
you
will
be
certain
of
meeting
your
type
but
here
within
fifty
miles
of
the
railroad
the
man
who
now
stepped
into
view
however
preserved
in
his
appearance
all
the
old
traditions
he
was
briefly
a
short
man
built
very
square
immense
power
lurked
in
the
broad
heavy
shoulders
the
massive
chest
the
thick
arms
the
sturdy
legs
as
for
his
face
it
was
almost
entirely
concealed
behind
a
curly
square
black
beard
that
grew
above
his
nearly
to
his
eyes
only
a
thick
hawk
nose
an
inscrutable
pair
of
black
eyes
under
phenomenally
heavy
eyebrows
and
a
short
black
pipe
showed
plainly
from
the
hirsute
tangle
he
was
lock
stock
and
barrel
of
the
far
north
one
of
the
old
i
was
rejoiced
to
see
him
there
but
did
not
betray
a
glimmer
of
interest
i
knew
my
type
too
well
for
that
how
are
you
he
said
grudgingly
said
i
we
leaned
against
the
fence
and
smoked
each
contemplating
carefully
the
end
of
his
pipe
i
knew
better
than
to
say
anything
the
trader
was
looking
me
over
making
up
his
mind
about
me
speech
on
my
part
would
argue
lightness
of
disposition
for
it
would
seem
to
indicate
that
i
was
not
also
making
up
my
mind
about
him
in
this
pause
there
was
not
the
least
unfriendliness
only
in
the
woods
you
prefer
to
know
first
the
business
and
character
of
a
chance
acquaintance
afterwards
you
may
ingratiate
to
his
good
will
all
of
which
possesses
a
beautiful
simplicity
for
it
proves
that
good
or
bad
opinion
need
not
depend
on
how
gracefully
you
can
chatter
assurances
at
the
end
of
a
long
period
the
trader
inquired
which
way
you
headed
out
in
a
canoe
for
pleasure
headed
almost
anywhere
again
we
smoked
dog
any
good
asked
the
trader
removing
his
pipe
and
pointing
to
the
observant
deuce
he
hunt
shade
on
a
hot
day
said
i
tentatively
how
the
fur
in
this
district
we
were
off
he
invited
me
in
and
showed
me
his
bear
in
ten
minutes
we
were
seated
on
the
veranda
and
slowly
very
cautiously
in
abbreviated
syncopation
were
feeling
our
way
toward
an
intimacy
now
came
the
indians
i
had
seen
at
the
lake
to
barter
for
some
flour
and
pork
i
was
glad
of
the
chance
to
follow
them
all
into
the
a
low
wooden
counter
backed
by
a
grill
divided
the
main
body
of
the
room
from
the
entrance
it
was
deliciously
dim
all
the
charm
of
the
aromatic
shop
was
in
the
place
and
an
additional
flavour
of
the
wilds
everything
here
was
meant
for
the
indian
trade
bolts
of
ginghams
blankets
of
red
or
blue
articles
of
clothing
boxes
of
beads
for
decoration
skeins
of
brilliant
silk
lead
bars
for
stacks
of
long
trade
guns
in
the
corner
small
mirrors
red
and
worsted
sashes
with
tassels
on
the
ends
steel
traps
of
various
sizes
and
a
dozen
other
articles
to
be
desired
by
the
forest
people
and
here
unlike
the
aromatic
shop
were
none
of
the
products
of
the
far
north
all
that
i
knew
was
to
be
found
elsewhere
in
another
apartment
equally
dim
but
delightful
in
the
orderly
disorder
of
a
storeroom
afterwards
i
made
the
excuse
of
a
pair
of
moccasins
to
see
this
other
room
we
climbed
a
steep
rough
flight
of
stairs
to
emerge
through
a
sort
of
into
a
space
directly
under
the
roof
it
was
lit
only
by
a
single
little
square
at
one
end
deep
under
the
eaves
i
could
make
out
row
after
row
of
boxes
and
chests
from
the
rafters
hung
a
dozen
pair
of
in
the
centre
of
the
floor
half
overturned
lay
an
open
box
from
which
tumbled
dozens
of
pairs
of
moccasins
shades
of
childhood
what
a
place
no
one
of
us
can
fail
to
recall
with
a
thrill
the
delights
of
a
rummage
in
the
attic
the
joy
of
pulling
from
some
trunk
a
wholly
forgotten
shabby
garment
which
nevertheless
has
taken
to
itself
from
the
stillness
of
undisturbed
years
the
faint
aroma
of
romance
the
rapture
of
discovering
in
the
dusk
of
a
concealed
nook
some
old
spur
or
broken
knife
or
rusty
pistol
redolent
of
the
open
road
such
essentially
commonplace
affairs
they
are
after
all
in
the
light
of
our
mature
common
sense
but
such
unspeakable
ecstasies
to
the
years
of
fancy
here
would
no
fancy
be
required
to
rummage
in
these
silent
chests
and
boxes
would
be
to
rummage
not
in
the
fictions
of
imagination
but
the
facts
of
the
most
real
picturesque
in
yonder
square
box
are
the
shoes
of
silence
that
velvet
dimness
would
prove
to
be
the
fur
of
a
bear
this
package
contains
maple
sugar
savoured
of
the
wilds
buckskin
both
white
and
buff
bears
claws
in
strings
bundles
of
medicinal
herbs
baskets
fragrant
as
an
eastern
tale
boxes
embroidered
with
stained
quills
of
the
porcupines
bows
of
hickory
and
arrows
of
maple
queer
of
stiff
sealskin
from
the
very
shores
of
the
hudson
bay
belts
of
beadwork
yellow
and
green
for
the
corn
dance
even
a
costume
or
so
of
buckskin
complete
for
ceremonial
all
these
the
fortunate
child
would
find
were
he
to
take
the
privilege
in
this
the
most
wonderful
attic
in
all
the
world
and
then
after
he
had
stroked
the
soft
fur
and
smelled
the
buckskin
and
sweet
grasses
and
tasted
the
crumbling
maple
sugar
and
dressed
himself
in
the
barbaric
splendours
of
the
north
he
could
flatten
his
little
nose
against
the
dim
square
of
light
and
look
out
over
the
glistening
yellow
backs
of
a
dozen
birchbark
canoes
to
the
distant
hills
beyond
which
lay
the
country
whence
all
these
things
had
come
do
you
wonder
that
in
after
years
that
child
hits
the
long
trail
do
you
still
wonder
at
finding
these
strange
taciturn
formidable
men
dwelling
lonely
in
the
silent
places
the
trader
yanked
several
of
the
boxes
to
the
centre
and
prosaically
tumbled
about
their
contents
he
brought
to
light
heavy
moccasins
with
high
linen
tops
for
the
snow
lighter
buckskin
moccasins
again
with
the
high
tops
but
this
time
of
white
tanned
doeskin
moccasins
with
rolled
edges
for
the
summer
shoepacs
with
and
without
the
flexible
leather
sole
cruisers
of
varying
degree
of
height
each
and
every
sort
of
footgear
in
use
in
the
far
north
excepting
and
saving
always
the
beautiful
soft
doeskin
slippers
finished
with
white
fawnskin
and
ornamented
with
the
ojibway
flower
pattern
for
which
i
sought
finally
he
gave
it
up
i
had
a
few
pair
they
must
have
been
sent
out
said
he
we
rummaged
a
little
further
for
luck
sake
then
descended
to
the
outer
air
i
left
him
to
fetch
my
canoe
but
returned
in
the
afternoon
we
became
friends
that
evening
we
sat
in
the
little
and
talked
far
into
the
night
he
was
a
true
hudson
bay
man
steadfastly
loyal
to
the
company
i
mentioned
the
legend
of
longue
he
stoutly
asserted
he
had
never
heard
of
it
i
tried
to
buy
a
or
so
to
hang
on
the
wall
as
souvenir
of
my
visit
he
was
genuinely
distressed
but
had
to
refuse
because
the
company
had
not
authorized
him
to
sell
and
he
had
nothing
of
his
own
to
give
i
mentioned
the
river
of
the
moose
the
land
of
little
sticks
his
deep
eyes
sparkled
with
excitement
and
he
asked
eagerly
a
multitude
of
details
concerning
late
news
from
the
northern
posts
and
as
the
evening
dwindled
after
the
manner
of
traders
everywhere
he
began
to
tell
me
the
ghost
stories
of
this
station
of
cloche
every
post
has
gathered
a
mass
of
legendary
lore
in
the
slow
years
but
this
had
been
on
the
route
of
the
from
montreal
and
quebec
at
the
time
when
the
lords
of
the
north
journeyed
to
the
scenes
of
their
annual
revels
at
fort
williams
the
trader
had
much
to
say
of
the
magnificence
and
luxury
of
these
men
their
cooks
their
silken
tents
their
strange
and
costly
foods
their
rare
wines
their
hordes
of
french
and
indian
canoemen
and
packers
then
cloche
was
a
for
the
night
its
meadows
had
blossomed
many
times
with
the
gay
tents
and
banners
of
a
great
company
he
told
me
as
vividly
as
though
he
had
been
an
of
how
the
canoes
must
have
loomed
up
suddenly
from
between
the
islands
he
seized
the
lamp
and
conducted
me
outside
where
hung
ponderous
ornamental
steelyards
on
which
in
the
old
days
the
peltries
were
weighed
it
is
not
so
now
said
he
we
buy
by
count
and
modern
scales
weigh
the
provisions
and
the
beaver
are
all
gone
we
the
house
in
silence
after
a
while
he
began
briefly
to
sketch
his
own
career
then
indeed
the
flavour
of
the
far
north
breathed
its
crisp
bracing
ozone
through
the
atmosphere
of
the
room
he
had
started
life
at
one
of
the
posts
of
the
far
at
the
age
of
twelve
he
enlisted
in
the
company
throughout
forty
years
he
had
served
her
he
had
travelled
to
all
the
strange
places
of
the
north
and
claimed
to
have
stood
on
the
shores
of
that
lake
of
yamba
tooh
it
was
snowing
at
the
time
he
said
prosaically
and
i
could
see
anything
except
that
i
have
to
bear
to
the
east
to
get
away
from
open
water
maybe
she
was
the
lake
the
injins
said
she
was
but
i
was
too
almighty
shy
of
grub
to
bother
with
lakes
other
names
fell
from
him
in
the
course
of
talk
some
of
which
i
had
heard
and
some
not
but
all
of
which
rang
sweet
and
clear
with
no
uncertain
note
of
adventure
especially
haunts
my
memory
an
impression
of
desolate
burned
trees
standing
in
death
on
the
shores
of
lost
river
he
told
me
he
had
been
four
years
at
cloche
but
expected
shortly
to
be
transferred
as
the
fur
was
getting
scarce
and
another
post
one
hundred
miles
to
the
west
could
care
for
the
dwindling
trade
he
hoped
to
be
sent
into
the
but
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
he
said
so
as
though
that
were
in
the
hands
of
the
gods
at
the
last
he
fished
out
a
concertina
and
played
for
me
have
you
ever
heard
after
dark
in
the
north
where
the
hills
grow
big
at
sunset
la
claire
crooned
to
such
an
accompaniment
and
by
a
man
of
impassive
bulk
and
countenance
but
with
glowing
eyes
i
said
and
stumbled
through
the
cool
dark
to
my
tent
near
the
beach
the
weird
minor
strains
breathed
after
me
as
i
went
a
la
claire
fontaine
allant
promener
trouvé
si
belle
que
je
suis
baigné
il
y
a
longtemps
que
je
jamais
je
ne
the
next
day
with
the
combers
of
a
howling
gale
clutching
at
the
stern
of
the
canoe
i
rode
in
a
glory
of
spray
and
excitement
back
to
dick
and
his
settlement
but
the
incident
had
its
sequel
the
following
season
as
i
was
sitting
writing
at
my
desk
a
strange
package
was
brought
me
it
was
wrapped
in
linen
sewn
strongly
with
waxed
cord
its
contents
lie
before
me
now
a
pair
of
moccasins
fashioned
of
the
finest
doeskin
tanned
so
beautifully
that
the
delicious
smoke
fragrance
fills
the
room
and
so
effectively
that
they
could
be
washed
with
soap
and
water
without
destroying
their
softness
the
piece
over
the
instep
is
of
white
fawnskin
heavily
ornamented
in
five
colours
of
silk
where
it
joins
the
foot
of
the
slipper
it
is
worked
over
and
over
into
a
narrow
cord
of
red
and
blue
silk
the
edge
about
the
ankle
is
turned
over
deeply
scalloped
and
bound
at
the
top
with
a
broad
band
of
blue
silk
stitched
with
pink
two
tiny
blue
bows
at
either
side
the
ankle
ornament
the
front
altogether
a
most
magnificent
no
word
accompanied
them
apparently
but
after
some
search
i
drew
a
bit
of
paper
from
the
toe
of
one
of
them
it
was
inscribed
simply
fort
la
cloche
xi
the
habitants
during
my
absence
dick
had
made
many
friends
wherein
lies
his
secret
i
do
not
know
but
he
has
a
peculiar
power
of
ingratiation
with
people
whose
lives
are
quite
outside
his
experience
or
sympathies
in
the
short
space
of
four
days
he
had
earned
joyous
greetings
from
every
one
in
town
the
children
grinned
at
him
cheerfully
the
old
women
cackled
little
teasing
jests
to
him
as
he
passed
the
pretty
dusky
girls
dropped
their
eyelashes
fascinatingly
across
their
cheeks
tempering
their
coyness
with
a
smile
the
men
painfully
demanded
information
as
to
artistic
achievement
which
was
evidently
as
well
meant
as
it
was
foreign
to
any
real
thirst
for
knowledge
they
might
possess
even
the
addressed
him
as
bub
and
withal
dick
methods
of
approach
were
radically
wrong
for
he
blundered
upon
new
acquaintance
with
a
beaming
smile
which
is
ordinarily
a
sure
repellent
to
the
cautious
taciturn
men
of
the
woods
perhaps
their
keenness
penetrated
to
the
fact
that
he
was
absolutely
without
guile
and
that
his
kindness
was
an
essential
part
of
himself
i
should
be
curious
to
know
whether
billy
knapp
of
the
black
hills
would
surrender
his
gun
to
dick
for
inspection
i
want
you
to
go
out
this
afternoon
to
see
some
friends
of
mine
said
dick
they
on
a
farm
about
two
miles
back
in
the
brush
ancestors
they
what
i
inquired
ancestors
you
can
go
down
to
grosse
point
near
detroit
and
find
people
living
in
beautiful
country
places
next
the
water
and
after
dinner
they
show
you
an
old
silhouette
or
a
daguerreotype
or
something
like
that
and
will
say
to
you
proudly
is
old
jules
my
ancestor
who
was
a
pioneer
in
this
country
the
place
has
been
in
the
family
ever
since
his
time
well
well
this
is
a
french
family
and
they
are
pioneers
and
the
family
has
a
place
that
slopes
down
to
the
water
through
white
birch
trees
and
it
is
of
the
kind
very
tenacious
of
its
own
land
in
two
hundred
years
this
will
be
a
great
resort
bound
to
be
beautiful
salubrious
good
sport
fine
scenery
accessible
railroad
fifty
miles
away
boat
every
once
in
a
while
said
i
sarcastically
accessible
in
two
hundred
years
all
right
insisted
dick
serenely
even
canada
can
build
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
railway
a
year
accessible
he
went
on
good
for
country
now
undeveloped
you
ought
to
be
a
real
estate
agent
i
advised
lived
two
hundred
years
too
soon
disclaimed
dick
what
more
obvious
these
are
certainly
ancestors
family
may
die
out
i
suggested
it
has
a
good
start
said
dick
sweetly
there
are
in
it
now
what
i
gasped
one
twelve
grandparents
parents
and
children
tabulated
dick
i
should
like
to
see
the
said
i
he
must
be
very
old
and
feeble
he
is
years
old
said
dick
and
the
last
time
i
saw
him
he
was
engaged
with
an
axe
in
clearing
trees
off
his
farm
all
of
these
astonishing
statements
i
found
to
be
absolutely
true
we
started
out
afoot
soon
after
dinner
through
a
scattering
growth
of
popples
that
alternately
drew
the
veil
of
coyness
over
the
blue
hills
and
caught
our
breath
with
the
delight
of
a
momentary
prospect
deuce
remembering
autumn
days
concluded
partridges
and
scurried
away
on
the
expert
diagonal
his
hind
legs
tucked
well
under
his
flanks
the
road
itself
was
a
mere
cutting
through
the
miniature
woods
winding
to
right
or
left
for
the
purpose
of
avoiding
a
or
a
boulder
surmounting
little
knolls
with
an
idle
disregard
for
the
straight
line
knobby
with
big
round
stones
and
interestingly
diversified
by
circular
mud
holes
a
foot
or
so
in
diameter
after
a
mile
and
a
half
we
came
to
the
corner
of
a
snake
fence
this
dick
informed
me
marked
the
limits
of
the
farm
we
burst
through
the
screen
of
popples
definitely
into
the
clear
a
house
of
squared
logs
crested
a
knoll
in
the
middle
distance
ten
acres
of
grass
marsh
perhaps
twenty
of
ploughed
land
and
then
the
of
popples
we
dodged
the
grass
marsh
and
gained
the
house
dick
was
at
once
among
friends
the
mother
had
no
english
so
smiled
expansively
her
bony
arms
folded
across
her
stomach
her
oldest
daughter
a
girl
in
the
twenties
but
with
a
sad
and
spiritual
beauty
of
the
madonna
in
her
big
eyes
and
straight
black
hair
gave
us
a
shy
three
boys
just
alike
in
their
slender
stolid
indian
good
looks
except
that
they
differed
in
size
nodded
with
the
awkwardness
of
the
male
two
babies
stared
solemnly
a
little
girl
with
a
beautiful
oval
face
large
mischievous
gray
eyes
behind
long
black
lashes
a
mischievously
quirked
mouth
to
match
the
eyes
and
black
hair
banged
straight
both
front
and
behind
in
almost
mediaeval
fashion
twirked
a
pair
of
brown
bare
legs
all
about
us
another
curly
little
girl
surmounted
by
an
old
spread
apart
sturdy
shoes
in
an
attitude
at
once
critical
and
expectant
dick
rose
to
the
occasion
by
sorting
out
from
some
concealed
recess
of
his
garments
a
huge
paper
parcel
of
candy
with
infinite
tact
he
presented
this
bag
to
madame
rather
than
the
children
madame
instituted
judicious
distribution
and
appropriate
reservation
for
the
future
we
entered
the
cabin
never
have
i
seen
a
place
more
exquisitely
neat
the
floor
had
not
only
been
washed
clean
it
had
been
scrubbed
white
the
walls
of
logs
were
freshly
whitewashed
the
chairs
were
polished
the
few
ornaments
were
new
and
not
at
all
dusty
or
dingy
or
tawdry
several
religious
pictures
a
portrait
of
royalty
a
lithographed
advertisement
of
some
buggy
a
photograph
or
so
and
then
just
the
fresh
wholesome
cleanliness
of
scrubbed
pine
madame
made
us
welcome
with
smiles
a
faded
lean
woman
with
a
remnant
of
beauty
peeping
from
her
soft
eyes
but
worn
down
to
the
first
principles
of
pioneer
bone
and
gristle
by
toil
care
and
the
bearing
of
children
i
spoke
to
her
in
french
complimenting
her
on
the
appearance
of
the
place
she
was
genuinely
pleased
saying
in
reply
that
one
did
one
possible
but
that
children
with
an
expressive
pause
next
we
called
for
volunteers
to
show
us
to
the
our
elfish
little
girls
at
once
offered
and
went
dancing
off
down
the
trail
like
autumn
leaves
in
a
wind
whether
it
was
the
indian
in
them
or
the
effects
of
environment
or
merely
our
own
imaginations
we
both
had
the
same
thought
that
in
these
strange
taciturn
friendly
smiling
pirouetting
little
creatures
was
some
eerie
wild
strain
akin
to
the
woods
and
birds
and
animals
as
they
danced
on
ahead
of
us
turning
to
throw
us
a
delicious
smile
or
a
roguish
glance
of
nascent
coquetry
we
seemed
to
swing
into
an
orbit
of
experience
foreign
to
our
own
these
woods
people
were
in
the
last
analysis
as
inscrutable
to
us
as
the
squirrels
we
followed
our
swirling
airy
guides
down
through
a
trail
to
another
clearing
planted
with
potatoes
on
the
farther
side
of
this
they
stopped
hand
in
hand
at
the
woods
fringe
and
awaited
us
in
a
startlingly
sudden
repose
le
said
they
in
unison
at
the
words
a
huge
gaunt
man
clad
in
shirt
and
jeans
arose
and
confronted
us
our
first
impression
was
of
a
vast
framework
stiffened
and
shrunken
into
the
peculiar
petrifaction
of
age
our
second
of
a
wealth
of
beard
and
hair
our
third
of
eyes
wide
clear
and
tired
with
looking
out
on
a
century
of
the
world
time
his
movements
as
he
laid
one
side
his
axe
and
passed
a
great
gnarled
hand
across
his
forehead
were
angular
and
slow
we
knew
instinctively
the
quality
of
his
work
a
deliberate
pause
a
mighty
blow
another
pause
a
painful
recovery
labour
compounded
of
infinite
slow
patience
but
wonderfully
effective
in
the
week
result
it
would
go
on
without
haste
without
pause
inevitable
as
the
years
slowly
closing
about
the
toiler
his
mental
processes
would
be
of
the
same
fibre
the
apparent
hesitation
might
seem
to
waste
the
precious
hours
remaining
but
in
the
end
when
the
engine
started
it
would
move
surely
and
unswervingly
along
the
appointed
grooves
in
his
wealth
of
hair
in
his
wide
eyes
like
the
mysterious
blanks
of
a
marble
statue
in
his
huge
frame
gnarled
and
wasted
to
the
strange
impressive
powerful
of
phidias
old
men
he
seemed
to
us
to
deserve
a
wreath
and
a
marble
seat
with
strange
inscriptions
and
the
graceful
of
another
time
and
a
group
of
old
greeks
like
himself
with
whom
to
exchange
slow
sentences
on
the
body
politic
indeed
the
fact
that
his
seat
was
of
fallen
pine
and
his
draperies
of
butternut
brown
and
his
audience
two
children
an
artist
and
a
writer
and
his
body
politic
two
hundred
acres
in
the
wilderness
did
not
filch
from
him
the
impressiveness
of
his
estate
he
was
a
patriarch
it
did
not
need
the
park
of
birch
trees
the
grass
beneath
them
sloping
down
to
the
water
the
wooded
knoll
fairly
insisting
on
a
spacious
mansion
to
substantiate
dick
fancy
that
he
had
discovered
an
ancestor
neat
piles
of
brush
equally
neat
piles
of
stumps
as
cleanly
cut
as
by
a
saw
attested
the
old
man
efficiency
we
conversed
yes
said
he
the
soil
was
good
it
is
laborious
to
clear
away
the
forest
still
one
arrives
has
but
to
look
in
the
memory
of
his
oldest
grandson
even
all
this
was
a
forest
le
bon
dieu
had
blessed
him
his
family
was
large
yes
it
was
as
said
that
is
counting
himself
the
soil
was
not
wonderful
it
is
indeed
a
large
family
and
much
labour
but
somehow
there
was
always
food
for
all
for
his
part
he
had
a
great
pity
for
those
whom
god
had
not
blessed
it
must
be
very
lonesome
without
children
we
spared
a
private
thought
that
this
old
man
was
certainly
in
no
danger
of
loneliness
yes
he
went
on
he
was
old
he
was
not
as
quick
as
he
used
to
be
he
left
that
for
the
young
ones
still
he
could
do
a
work
he
was
most
proud
to
have
made
these
gentlemen
acquaintance
he
wished
us
we
left
him
seated
on
the
pine
log
his
axe
between
his
knees
his
great
gnarled
brown
hands
hanging
idly
after
a
time
we
heard
the
of
his
implement
then
after
another
long
time
we
heard
it
again
we
knew
that
those
two
blows
had
gone
straight
and
true
and
forceful
to
the
mark
so
old
a
man
had
no
energy
to
expend
in
the
indirections
of
haste
our
elfish
guides
led
us
back
along
the
trail
to
the
farmhouse
a
girl
of
thirteen
had
just
arrived
from
school
in
the
summer
the
little
ones
divided
the
educational
advantages
among
themselves
turn
and
turn
about
the
newcomer
had
been
out
into
the
world
and
was
dressed
accordingly
a
neat
cloth
dress
plainly
made
a
dull
red
and
blue
checked
apron
a
broad
round
hat
shoes
and
stockings
all
in
the
best
and
quietest
taste
marked
contrast
to
the
usual
garish
sunday
best
of
the
she
herself
exemplified
the
most
striking
type
of
beauty
to
be
found
in
the
mixed
bloods
her
hair
was
thick
and
glossy
and
black
in
the
mode
that
throws
deep
purple
shadows
under
the
rolls
and
coils
her
face
was
a
regular
oval
like
the
opening
in
a
wishbone
her
skin
was
dark
but
rich
and
dusky
with
life
and
red
blood
that
ebbed
and
flowed
with
her
shyness
her
lips
were
full
and
of
a
dark
cherry
red
her
eyes
were
deep
rather
musing
and
furnished
with
the
most
gloriously
tangling
of
eyelashes
dick
went
into
ecstasies
took
several
photographs
which
did
not
turn
out
well
and
made
one
sketch
which
did
perpetually
did
he
bewail
the
absence
of
oils
the
type
is
not
uncommon
but
its
beauty
rarely
remains
perfect
after
the
fifteenth
year
we
made
our
ceremonious
adieus
to
the
madame
and
started
back
to
town
under
the
guidance
of
one
of
the
boys
who
promised
us
a
short
cut
this
youth
proved
to
be
filled
with
the
old
wandering
spirit
that
lures
so
many
of
his
race
into
the
wilderness
life
he
confided
to
us
as
we
walked
that
he
liked
to
tramp
extended
distances
and
that
the
days
were
really
not
made
long
enough
for
those
who
had
to
return
home
at
night
i
is
been
top
of
dose
hills
he
said
bime
by
i
mak
heem
go
to
dose
lak
beyon
he
told
us
that
some
day
he
hoped
to
go
out
with
the
fur
traders
in
his
vocabulary
i
wish
occurred
with
such
wistful
frequency
that
finally
i
inquired
curiously
what
use
he
would
make
of
the
fairy
gift
if
you
could
have
just
one
wish
come
true
pierre
i
asked
what
would
you
desire
his
answer
came
without
a
moment
hesitation
i
is
lak
be
one
giant
said
he
why
i
demanded
so
i
can
mak
heem
de
walk
far
he
replied
simply
i
was
tempted
to
point
out
to
him
the
fact
that
big
men
do
not
outlast
the
little
men
and
that
vast
strength
rarely
endures
but
then
a
better
feeling
persuaded
me
to
leave
him
his
illusions
the
power
even
in
fancy
of
striding
on
boots
across
the
fascinations
spread
out
below
his
kindling
vision
from
dose
hills
was
too
precious
a
possession
lightly
to
be
taken
away
strangely
enough
though
his
woodcraft
naturally
was
not
inconsiderable
it
did
not
hold
his
paramount
interest
he
knew
something
about
animals
and
their
ways
and
their
methods
of
capture
but
the
chase
did
not
appeal
strongly
to
him
nor
apparently
did
he
possess
much
skill
along
that
line
he
liked
the
actual
physical
labour
the
walking
the
paddling
the
the
the
new
country
the
companionship
of
the
wild
life
the
wilderness
as
a
whole
rather
than
in
any
one
of
its
single
aspects
as
fish
pond
game
preserve
picture
gallery
in
this
he
showed
the
true
spirit
of
the
i
should
confidently
look
to
meet
him
in
another
ten
years
if
threats
of
railroads
spare
the
far
north
so
long
girdled
with
the
red
sash
shod
in
silent
moccasins
bending
beneath
the
portage
load
trolling
to
the
silent
land
somewhere
under
the
arctic
circle
the
french
of
the
north
have
never
been
great
fighters
nor
great
hunters
in
the
terms
of
the
frontiersmen
but
they
have
laughed
in
farther
places
xii
the
river
at
a
certain
spot
on
the
north
shore
i
am
not
going
to
tell
you
where
you
board
one
of
the
two
or
three
that
collect
from
the
different
stations
the
big
of
lake
superior
whitefish
after
a
certain
number
of
hours
i
am
not
going
to
tell
you
how
many
your
craft
will
turn
in
toward
a
semicircle
of
bold
beautiful
hills
that
seem
at
first
to
be
many
less
miles
distant
than
the
reality
and
at
the
last
to
be
many
more
miles
remote
than
is
the
fact
from
the
prow
you
will
make
out
first
a
uniform
velvet
green
then
the
differentiation
of
many
shades
then
the
dull
neutrals
of
rocks
and
crags
finally
the
narrow
white
of
a
pebble
beach
against
which
the
waves
utter
continually
a
rattling
undertone
the
steamer
pushes
boldly
in
the
cool
green
of
the
water
underneath
changes
to
gray
suddenly
you
make
out
the
bottom
as
through
a
thick
green
glass
and
the
big
suckers
and
catfish
idling
over
its
riffled
sands
inconceivably
far
down
through
the
unbelievably
clear
liquid
so
absorbed
are
you
in
this
marvellous
clarity
that
a
slight
grinding
jar
alone
brings
you
to
yourself
the
steamer
nose
is
actually
touching
the
white
strip
of
pebbles
now
you
can
do
one
of
a
number
of
things
the
forest
slants
down
to
your
feet
in
dwindling
scrub
which
half
conceals
an
abandoned
log
structure
this
latter
is
the
old
hudson
bay
post
behind
it
is
the
fur
trail
and
the
fur
trail
will
take
you
three
miles
to
burned
rock
pool
where
are
spring
water
and
mighty
trout
but
again
half
a
mile
to
the
left
is
the
mouth
of
the
river
and
the
river
meanders
charmingly
through
the
woods
of
the
flat
country
over
numberless
riffles
and
rapids
beneath
various
steep
gravel
banks
until
it
sweeps
boldly
under
the
cliff
of
the
first
high
hill
there
a
rugged
precipice
rises
sheer
and
jagged
and
to
overhanging
trees
clinging
to
the
shoulder
of
the
mountain
and
precisely
at
that
spot
is
a
bend
where
the
water
hits
square
to
divide
right
and
left
in
whiteness
to
swirl
into
convolutions
of
foam
to
lurk
darkly
for
a
moment
on
the
edge
of
tumult
before
racing
away
and
there
you
can
stand
and
just
reach
the
eddy
foam
with
a
cast
tied
craftily
of
royal
coachman
parmachenee
belle
and
montreal
from
that
point
you
are
with
the
hills
they
draw
back
to
leave
wide
forest
but
always
they
return
to
the
river
as
you
would
return
season
after
season
were
i
to
tell
you
how
throwing
across
your
a
sheer
cliff
forty
or
fifty
feet
high
shouldering
you
incontinently
into
the
necessity
of
fording
to
the
other
side
more
and
more
jealous
they
become
as
you
penetrate
until
at
the
big
falls
they
close
in
entirely
warning
you
that
here
they
take
the
wilderness
to
themselves
at
the
big
falls
anglers
make
their
last
camp
about
the
fire
they
may
discuss
idly
various
academic
questions
as
to
whether
the
great
inaccessible
pool
below
the
falls
really
contains
the
legendary
biggest
trout
what
direction
the
river
takes
above
whether
it
really
becomes
nothing
but
a
series
of
stagnant
pools
connected
by
sluggish
whether
there
are
any
trout
above
the
falls
and
so
on
these
questions
as
i
have
said
are
merely
academic
your
true
angler
is
a
philosopher
enough
is
to
him
worth
fifteen
courses
and
if
the
finite
mind
of
man
could
imagine
anything
to
be
desired
as
an
addition
to
his
present
possessions
on
the
river
he
at
least
knows
nothing
of
it
already
he
commands
ten
miles
of
water
swift
clear
water
running
over
stone
through
a
freshet
bed
so
many
hundreds
of
feet
wide
that
he
has
forgotten
what
it
means
to
guard
his
back
cast
it
is
to
be
waded
in
the
riffles
so
that
he
can
cross
from
one
shore
to
the
other
as
the
mood
suits
him
one
bank
is
apt
to
be
precipitous
the
other
to
stretch
away
in
a
mile
or
so
of
the
coolest
greenest
stillest
primeval
forest
to
be
imagined
thus
he
can
cut
across
the
wide
bends
of
the
river
should
he
so
desire
and
should
haste
be
necessary
to
make
camp
before
dark
and
last
but
not
least
by
any
manner
of
means
there
are
trout
i
mean
real
trout
big
fellows
the
kind
the
fishers
of
little
streams
dream
of
but
awake
to
call
morpheus
a
liar
just
as
they
are
too
polite
to
call
you
a
liar
when
you
are
so
indiscreet
as
to
tell
them
a
few
plain
facts
i
have
one
solemnly
attested
and
witnessed
record
of
inches
caught
in
running
water
i
saw
a
friend
land
on
one
cast
three
whose
aggregate
weight
was
four
and
one
half
pounds
i
witnessed
and
partly
shared
an
exciting
struggle
in
which
three
fish
on
three
rods
were
played
in
the
same
pool
at
the
same
time
they
weighed
just
fourteen
pounds
one
pool
a
backset
was
known
as
the
idiot
delight
because
any
one
could
catch
fish
there
i
have
lain
on
my
stomach
at
the
burned
rock
pool
and
seen
the
great
fish
lying
so
close
together
as
nearly
to
cover
the
bottom
rank
after
rank
of
them
and
the
smallest
not
under
a
half
pound
as
to
the
largest
well
every
true
fisherman
knows
him
so
it
came
about
for
many
years
that
the
natural
barrier
interposed
by
the
big
falls
successfully
turned
the
idle
tide
of
exploration
beyond
them
lay
an
unknown
country
but
you
had
to
climb
cruelly
to
see
it
and
you
could
gain
above
what
you
already
had
in
any
case
the
nearest
settlement
was
nearly
sixty
miles
away
so
even
added
isolation
had
not
its
usual
quickening
effect
on
camper
effort
the
river
is
visited
by
few
anyway
an
occasional
adventurous
steam
yacht
pauses
at
the
mouth
fishes
a
few
little
ones
from
the
shallow
pools
there
or
a
few
big
ones
from
the
reefs
and
pushes
on
it
never
dreams
of
sending
an
expedition
to
the
interior
our
own
people
and
two
other
parties
are
all
i
know
of
who
visit
the
river
regularly
our
alone
break
the
forest
our
blazes
alone
continue
the
initial
short
cut
of
the
fur
trail
our
names
alone
distinguish
the
various
pools
we
had
always
been
satisfied
to
compromise
with
the
frowning
hills
in
return
for
the
delicious
necks
and
points
and
forest
areas
through
which
our
clipped
trails
ran
we
had
tacitly
respected
the
mystery
of
the
upper
reaches
this
year
however
a
number
of
unusual
conditions
changed
our
spirit
i
have
perhaps
neglected
to
state
that
our
trip
up
to
now
had
been
a
rather
singularly
damp
one
of
the
first
fourteen
days
twelve
had
been
rainy
this
was
only
a
slightly
exaggerated
sample
for
the
rest
of
the
time
as
a
consequence
we
found
the
river
filled
even
to
the
limit
of
its
freshet
banks
the
broad
borders
of
stone
beach
between
the
stream
edge
and
the
bushes
had
quite
disappeared
the
riffles
had
become
rapids
and
the
rapids
roaring
torrents
the
bends
boiled
angrily
with
a
smashing
eddy
that
sucked
air
into
pirouetting
cavities
inches
in
depth
plainly
was
out
of
the
question
no
trout
would
rise
to
the
surface
of
such
a
moil
or
abandon
for
syllabubs
of
tinsel
the
magnificent
solidities
of
such
a
freshet
would
bring
down
from
the
hills
also
the
river
was
unfordable
we
made
camp
at
the
mouth
and
consulted
together
billy
the
who
had
joined
us
for
the
labour
of
a
permanent
camp
shook
his
head
i
one
week
ten
day
he
vouchsafed
she
go
down
den
we
mus
wait
we
did
not
want
to
wait
the
idleness
of
a
permanent
camp
is
the
most
deadly
in
the
world
billy
said
i
have
you
ever
been
above
the
big
falls
the
eyes
flashed
non
he
replied
simply
bâ
i
lak
mak
heem
firs
rate
all
right
billy
we
do
it
the
next
day
it
rained
and
the
river
went
up
two
inches
the
morning
following
was
fair
enough
but
so
cold
you
could
see
your
breath
we
began
to
experiment
now
this
expedition
had
become
a
fishing
vacation
so
we
had
all
the
comforts
of
home
with
us
when
said
comforts
of
home
were
laden
into
the
canoe
there
remained
forward
and
aft
just
about
one
square
foot
of
space
for
billy
and
me
and
not
over
two
inches
of
freeboard
for
the
river
we
could
not
stand
up
and
pole
tracking
with
a
was
out
of
the
question
because
there
existed
no
banks
on
which
to
walk
the
current
was
too
swift
for
paddling
so
we
knelt
and
poled
we
knew
it
before
but
we
had
to
be
convinced
by
trial
that
two
inches
of
freeboard
will
dip
under
the
most
gingerly
effort
it
did
so
we
groaned
stepped
out
into
up
to
our
waists
and
so
began
the
day
journey
with
fleeting
reference
to
dante
nethermost
hell
next
the
shore
the
water
was
most
of
the
time
a
little
above
our
knees
but
the
swirl
of
a
rushing
current
brought
an
apron
of
foam
to
our
hips
billy
took
the
bow
and
pulled
i
took
the
stern
and
pushed
in
places
our
combined
efforts
could
but
just
counterbalance
the
strength
of
the
current
then
billy
had
to
hang
on
until
i
could
get
my
shoulder
against
the
stern
for
a
mighty
heave
the
few
inches
gain
of
which
he
would
guard
as
jealously
as
possible
until
i
could
get
into
position
for
another
shove
at
other
places
we
were
in
nearly
to
our
armpits
but
close
under
the
banks
where
we
could
help
ourselves
by
seizing
bushes
sometimes
i
lost
my
footing
entirely
and
trailed
out
behind
like
a
streamer
sometimes
billy
would
be
swept
away
the
canoe
bow
would
swing
and
i
would
have
to
dig
my
heels
and
hang
on
until
he
had
floundered
upright
fortunately
for
our
provisions
this
never
happened
to
both
at
the
same
time
the
difficulties
were
still
further
complicated
by
the
fact
that
our
feet
speedily
became
so
numb
from
the
cold
that
we
could
not
feel
the
bottom
and
so
were
much
inclined
to
aimless
stumblings
we
got
out
and
kicked
trees
to
start
the
circulation
in
the
meantime
the
sun
had
retired
behind
thick
leaden
clouds
at
the
first
bend
we
were
forced
to
carry
some
fifty
feet
there
the
river
rushed
down
in
a
smooth
apron
straight
against
the
cliff
where
its
force
actually
raised
the
mass
of
water
a
good
three
feet
higher
than
the
level
of
the
surrounding
pool
i
tied
on
a
and
two
cartridges
for
sinkers
and
in
fifteen
minutes
had
caught
three
trout
one
of
which
weighed
three
pounds
and
the
others
two
pounds
and
a
pound
and
a
half
respectively
at
this
point
dick
and
deuce
who
had
been
paralleling
through
the
woods
joined
us
we
broiled
the
trout
and
boiled
tea
and
shivered
as
near
the
fire
as
we
could
that
afternoon
by
dint
of
labour
and
labour
and
yet
more
labour
we
made
burned
rock
and
there
we
camped
for
the
night
utterly
beaten
out
by
about
as
hard
a
day
travel
as
a
man
would
want
to
undertake
the
following
day
was
even
worse
for
as
the
natural
bed
of
the
river
narrowed
we
found
less
and
less
footing
and
swifter
and
swifter
water
the
journey
to
burned
rock
had
been
a
matter
of
dogged
hard
work
this
was
an
affair
of
alertness
of
taking
advantage
of
every
little
eddy
of
breathless
suspense
during
long
seconds
while
the
question
of
supremacy
between
our
strength
and
the
stream
was
being
debated
and
the
thermometer
must
have
registered
well
towards
freezing
three
times
we
were
forced
to
cross
the
river
in
order
to
get
even
precarious
footing
those
were
the
really
doubtful
moments
we
had
to
get
in
carefully
to
sit
craftily
and
to
paddle
gingerly
and
firmly
without
attempting
to
counteract
the
downward
sweep
of
the
current
all
our
energies
and
care
were
given
to
preventing
those
miserable
curling
little
waves
from
our
precious
two
inches
and
that
miserable
little
canoe
from
departing
even
by
a
from
the
exactly
level
keel
where
we
were
going
did
not
matter
after
an
interminable
interval
the
tail
of
our
eyes
would
catch
the
sway
of
bushes
near
at
hand
now
billy
would
mutter
abstractedly
with
one
accord
we
would
arise
from
six
inches
of
wet
and
step
swiftly
into
the
river
the
lightened
canoe
would
strain
back
we
would
brace
our
legs
the
traverse
was
accomplished
illustration
watched
the
long
north
country
twilight
steal
up
like
a
gray
cloud
from
the
east
being
thus
under
the
other
bank
i
would
hold
the
canoe
while
billy
astraddle
the
other
end
for
the
purpose
of
depressing
the
water
to
within
reach
of
his
hand
would
bail
away
the
consequences
of
our
crossing
then
we
would
make
up
the
quarter
of
a
mile
we
had
lost
we
quit
at
the
organ
pool
about
three
of
the
afternoon
not
much
was
said
that
evening
the
day
following
we
tied
into
it
again
this
time
we
put
dick
and
deuce
on
an
old
indian
trail
that
promised
a
short
cut
with
instructions
to
wait
at
the
end
of
it
in
the
joyous
anticipation
of
another
wet
day
we
forgot
they
had
never
before
followed
an
indian
trail
let
us
now
turn
aside
to
the
adventures
of
dick
and
deuce
be
it
premised
here
that
dick
is
a
regular
indian
of
taciturnity
when
it
becomes
a
question
of
his
own
experience
so
that
for
a
long
time
we
knew
of
what
follows
but
the
single
explanatory
monosyllable
which
you
shall
read
in
due
time
but
dick
has
a
beloved
uncle
in
moments
of
expansion
to
this
relative
after
his
return
he
held
forth
as
to
the
happenings
of
that
morning
dick
and
the
setter
managed
the
indian
trail
for
about
twenty
rods
they
thought
they
managed
it
for
perhaps
twice
that
distance
then
it
became
borne
in
on
them
that
the
bushes
went
back
the
faint
and
the
half
that
alone
constitute
an
indian
trail
had
taken
another
direction
and
that
they
had
now
their
own
way
to
make
through
the
forest
dick
knew
the
direction
well
enough
so
he
broke
ahead
confidently
after
a
walk
he
crossed
a
tiny
streamlet
after
another
walk
he
came
to
another
it
was
flowing
the
wrong
way
dick
did
not
understand
this
he
had
never
known
of
little
streams
flowing
away
from
rivers
and
towards
hills
this
might
be
a
loop
of
course
he
resolved
to
follow
it
far
enough
to
settle
the
point
the
following
brought
him
in
time
to
a
soggy
little
thicket
with
three
areas
of
mud
and
two
round
pellucid
pools
of
water
about
a
foot
in
diameter
as
the
little
stream
had
wound
and
twisted
dick
had
by
now
lost
entirely
his
sense
of
direction
he
fished
out
his
compass
and
set
it
on
a
rock
the
river
flows
nearly
to
the
big
falls
and
dick
knew
himself
to
be
somewhere
east
of
the
river
the
compass
appeared
to
be
wrong
dick
was
a
youth
of
sense
so
he
did
not
quarrel
with
the
compass
he
merely
became
doubtful
as
to
which
was
the
north
end
of
the
needle
the
white
or
the
black
after
a
few
moments
puzzling
he
was
quite
at
sea
and
could
no
more
remember
how
he
had
been
taught
as
to
this
than
you
can
clinch
the
spelling
of
a
doubtful
word
after
you
have
tried
on
paper
a
dozen
variations
but
being
a
youth
of
sense
he
did
not
desert
the
streamlet
after
a
short
of
stumbling
the
apparent
wrong
direction
in
the
brook
bed
he
came
to
the
river
the
river
was
also
flowing
the
wrong
way
and
uphill
dick
sat
down
and
covered
his
eyes
with
his
hands
as
i
had
told
him
to
do
in
like
instance
and
so
managed
to
swing
the
country
around
where
it
belonged
now
here
was
the
river
and
dick
resolved
to
desert
it
for
no
more
short
cuts
but
where
was
the
canoe
this
point
remained
unsettled
in
dick
mind
or
rather
it
was
alternately
settled
in
two
ways
sometimes
the
boy
concluded
we
must
be
still
below
him
so
he
would
sit
on
a
rock
to
wait
then
after
a
few
moments
inactivity
would
bring
him
panic
the
canoe
must
have
passed
this
point
long
since
and
every
second
he
wasted
stupidly
sitting
on
that
stone
separated
him
farther
from
his
friends
and
from
food
then
he
would
tear
madly
through
the
forest
deuce
enjoyed
this
game
but
dick
did
not
in
time
dick
found
his
farther
progress
along
the
banks
cut
off
by
a
hill
the
hill
ended
abruptly
at
the
water
edge
in
a
sheer
rock
cliff
thirty
feet
high
this
was
in
reality
the
end
of
the
indian
trail
short
cut
the
point
where
dick
was
to
meet
us
but
he
did
not
know
it
he
happened
for
the
moment
to
be
obsessed
by
one
of
his
canoe
panics
so
he
turned
inland
to
a
spot
where
the
hill
appeared
climbable
and
started
in
to
surmount
the
obstruction
this
was
comparatively
easy
at
first
then
the
shoulder
of
the
cliff
intervened
dick
mounted
still
a
little
higher
up
the
hill
then
higher
then
still
higher
far
down
to
his
left
through
the
trees
broiled
the
river
the
slope
of
the
hill
to
it
had
become
steeper
than
a
roof
and
at
the
edge
of
the
eaves
came
a
cliff
drop
of
thirty
feet
dick
picked
his
way
gingerly
over
curving
assisting
his
balance
by
a
number
of
little
cedar
trees
then
something
happened
dick
says
the
side
of
the
hill
slid
out
from
under
him
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
probably
the
over
loose
rounded
stones
gave
way
dick
sat
down
and
began
slowly
to
bump
down
the
slant
of
the
roof
he
never
really
lost
his
equilibrium
nor
until
the
last
ten
feet
did
he
abandon
the
hope
of
checking
his
descent
sometimes
he
did
actually
succeed
in
stopping
himself
for
a
moment
but
on
his
attempting
to
follow
up
the
advantage
the
moss
always
slipped
or
the
sapling
let
go
a
tenuous
hold
and
he
continued
on
down
at
last
the
river
flashed
out
below
him
he
saw
the
sheer
drop
he
saw
the
boiling
eddies
of
the
halfway
pool
capable
of
sucking
down
a
then
with
a
final
rush
of
loose
round
stones
he
shot
the
chutes
feet
first
into
space
in
the
meantime
billy
and
i
repeated
our
experience
of
the
two
previous
days
with
a
few
variations
caused
by
the
necessity
of
passing
two
exceptionally
ugly
rapids
whose
banks
left
little
footing
we
did
this
precariously
with
a
rope
the
cold
water
was
beginning
to
tell
on
our
vitality
so
that
twice
we
went
ashore
and
made
hot
tea
just
below
the
halfway
pool
we
began
to
do
a
little
figuring
ahead
which
is
a
bad
thing
the
halfway
pool
meant
much
inevitable
labour
with
its
two
swift
rapids
and
its
swirling
eddies
as
sedulously
to
be
avoided
as
so
many
steel
then
there
were
a
dozen
others
and
the
three
miles
of
riffles
and
all
the
rest
of
it
at
our
present
rate
it
would
take
us
a
week
to
make
the
falls
below
the
halfway
pool
we
looked
for
dick
he
was
not
to
be
seen
this
made
us
cross
at
the
halfway
pool
we
intended
to
unload
for
portage
and
also
to
ferry
over
dick
and
the
setter
in
the
lightened
canoe
the
tardiness
of
dick
delayed
the
game
however
we
drew
ashore
to
the
little
clearing
of
the
halfway
camp
made
the
year
before
and
wearily
discharged
our
cargo
suddenly
upstream
and
apparently
up
in
the
air
we
heard
distinctly
the
excited
yap
of
a
dog
billy
and
i
looked
at
each
other
then
we
looked
upstream
close
under
the
perpendicular
wall
of
rock
and
fifty
feet
from
the
end
of
it
waist
deep
in
water
that
swirled
angrily
about
him
stood
dick
i
knew
well
enough
what
he
was
standing
on
a
little
ledge
of
shale
not
over
five
or
six
feet
in
length
and
two
feet
wide
for
in
lower
water
i
had
often
from
its
advantage
cast
a
fly
down
below
the
big
boulder
but
i
knew
it
to
be
surrounded
by
water
fifteen
feet
deep
it
was
impossible
to
wade
to
the
spot
impossible
to
swim
to
it
and
why
in
the
name
of
all
the
woods
gods
would
a
man
want
to
wade
or
swim
to
it
if
he
could
the
affair
to
our
intellects
was
simply
incomprehensible
billy
and
i
spoke
no
word
we
silently
perhaps
a
little
fearfully
launched
the
empty
canoe
then
we
went
into
a
space
of
water
whose
treading
proved
us
no
angels
from
the
slack
water
under
the
cliff
we
took
another
look
it
was
indeed
dick
he
carried
a
in
one
hand
his
lay
against
his
hip
his
broad
hat
sat
accurately
level
on
his
head
his
face
was
imperturbable
above
deuce
agonized
afraid
to
leap
into
the
stream
but
convinced
that
his
duty
required
him
to
do
so
we
steadied
the
canoe
while
dick
climbed
in
you
would
have
thought
he
was
embarking
at
the
regularly
appointed
rendezvous
in
silence
we
shot
the
rapids
and
collected
deuce
from
the
end
of
the
trail
whither
he
followed
us
in
silence
we
worked
our
way
across
to
where
our
duffel
lay
scattered
in
silence
we
disembarked
in
heaven
name
dick
i
demanded
at
last
how
did
you
get
fell
said
he
succinctly
and
that
was
all
xiii
the
hills
we
explained
carefully
to
dick
that
he
had
lit
on
the
only
spot
in
the
halfway
pool
where
the
water
was
at
once
deep
enough
to
break
his
fall
and
not
too
deep
to
stand
in
we
also
pointed
out
that
he
had
escaped
being
telescoped
or
drowned
by
the
merest
from
this
we
drew
moral
conclusions
it
did
us
good
but
undoubtedly
dick
knew
it
already
now
we
gave
our
attention
to
the
wetness
of
garments
for
we
were
chilled
blue
a
big
fire
and
a
of
forked
sticks
and
a
sapling
an
change
a
lunch
of
hot
tea
and
trout
and
cold
galette
and
beans
a
pipe
and
then
the
inevitable
summing
up
we
had
in
two
and
a
half
days
made
the
easier
half
of
the
distance
to
the
falls
at
this
rate
we
would
consume
a
week
or
more
in
reaching
the
of
our
explorations
it
was
a
question
whether
we
could
stand
a
week
of
and
the
heavy
labour
combined
ordinarily
we
might
be
able
to
abandon
the
canoe
and
push
on
afoot
as
we
were
accustomed
to
do
when
but
that
involved
fording
the
river
three
times
a
feat
manifestly
impossible
in
present
freshet
conditions
i
we
quit
heem
said
billy
but
then
i
was
seized
with
an
inspiration
judging
by
the
configuration
of
the
hills
the
river
bent
sharply
above
the
falls
why
would
it
not
be
possible
to
cut
loose
entirely
at
this
point
to
strike
across
through
the
forest
and
so
to
come
out
on
the
upper
reaches
remained
only
the
probability
of
our
being
able
encumbered
by
a
pack
to
scale
the
mountains
billy
said
i
have
you
ever
been
over
in
those
hills
no
said
he
do
you
know
anything
about
the
country
are
there
any
trails
dat
countree
is
belong
tawabinisáy
he
know
heem
i
don
know
heem
i
he
is
have
many
hills
some
lak
do
you
think
we
can
climb
those
hills
with
packs
billy
cast
a
doubtful
glance
on
dick
then
his
eye
lit
up
tawabinisáy
is
tell
me
dat
lak
kawágama
we
fine
heem
in
so
saying
billy
decided
the
attempt
what
angler
on
the
river
has
not
discussed
again
idly
again
academically
that
mysterious
lake
alive
with
the
burnished
copper
trout
lying
hidden
and
wonderful
in
the
high
hills
clear
as
crystal
bottomed
with
gravel
like
a
fountain
shaped
like
a
great
crescent
whose
curves
were
haunted
of
forest
trees
grim
and
awesome
with
the
solemnity
of
the
primeval
that
its
exact
location
was
known
to
tawabinisáy
alone
that
the
trail
to
it
was
purposely
blinded
and
muddled
with
the
crossing
of
many
little
ponds
that
the
route
was
laborious
all
those
things
along
with
the
minor
details
so
dear
to
winter
were
matters
of
notoriety
probably
more
expeditions
to
kawágama
have
been
planned
in
february
than
would
fill
a
volume
with
an
account
of
anticipated
adventures
only
none
of
them
ever
came
off
we
were
accustomed
to
gaze
at
the
forbidden
cliff
ramparts
of
the
hills
to
think
of
the
idiot
delight
and
the
halfway
pool
and
the
organ
pool
and
the
burned
rock
pool
and
the
rolling
stone
pool
and
all
the
rest
of
them
even
up
to
the
big
falls
and
so
we
would
quietly
allow
our
february
plannings
to
lapse
one
man
tawabinisáy
had
honoured
but
this
man
named
clement
a
banker
from
peoria
had
proved
unworthy
tawabinisáy
told
how
he
caught
trout
many
many
trout
and
piled
them
on
the
shores
of
kawágama
to
defile
the
air
subsequently
this
same
sportsman
buried
another
big
catch
on
the
beach
of
superior
these
and
other
exploits
finally
earned
him
his
exclusion
from
the
delectable
land
i
give
his
name
because
i
have
personally
talked
with
his
guides
and
heard
their
circumstantial
accounts
of
his
performances
unless
three
or
four
woodsmen
are
fearful
liars
i
do
clement
no
injustice
since
then
tawabinisáy
had
hidden
himself
behind
his
impenetrable
grin
so
you
can
easily
see
that
the
discovery
of
kawágama
would
be
a
feat
worthy
even
high
hills
that
afternoon
we
rested
and
made
our
cache
a
cache
in
the
forest
country
is
simply
a
heavily
constructed
rustic
platform
on
which
provisions
and
clothing
are
laid
and
wrapped
completely
about
in
sheets
of
canoe
bark
tied
firmly
with
strips
of
cedar
bark
or
withes
made
from
a
bush
whose
appearance
i
know
well
but
whose
name
i
can
not
say
in
this
receptacle
we
left
all
our
canned
goods
our
extra
clothing
and
our
dutch
oven
we
retained
for
transportation
some
pork
flour
rice
oatmeal
sugar
and
tea
cooking
utensils
blankets
the
tent
and
the
little
pistol
as
we
were
about
to
go
into
the
high
country
where
presumably
both
game
and
fish
might
lack
we
were
forced
to
take
a
full
supply
for
four
counting
deuce
as
one
to
last
ten
days
the
packs
counted
up
about
one
hundred
and
fifteen
pounds
of
grub
twenty
pounds
of
blankets
ten
of
tent
say
eight
or
ten
of
hardware
including
the
axe
about
twenty
of
duffel
this
was
further
increased
by
the
idiosyncrasy
of
billy
he
like
most
woodsmen
was
wedded
to
a
single
utterly
foolish
article
of
personal
belonging
which
he
worshipped
as
a
fetish
and
without
which
he
was
unhappy
in
his
case
it
was
a
huge
winter
overcoat
that
must
have
weighed
fifteen
pounds
the
total
amounted
to
about
one
hundred
and
ninety
pounds
we
gave
dick
twenty
i
took
and
billy
shouldered
the
rest
the
carrying
we
did
with
the
universal
this
is
usually
described
as
a
strap
passed
about
a
pack
and
across
the
forehead
of
the
bearer
the
description
is
incorrect
it
passes
across
the
top
of
the
head
the
weight
should
rest
on
the
small
of
the
back
just
above
the
hips
not
on
the
broad
of
the
back
as
most
beginners
place
it
then
the
chin
should
be
dropped
the
body
slanted
sharply
forward
and
you
may
be
able
to
stagger
forty
rods
at
your
first
attempt
use
soon
accustoms
you
to
carrying
however
the
first
time
i
ever
did
any
packing
i
had
a
hard
time
stumbling
a
few
hundred
feet
over
a
hill
portage
with
just
fifty
pounds
on
my
back
by
the
end
of
that
same
trip
i
could
carry
a
hundred
pounds
and
a
lot
of
miscellaneous
traps
like
and
guns
without
serious
inconvenience
and
over
a
long
portage
this
power
comes
partly
from
a
strengthening
of
the
muscles
of
the
neck
but
more
from
a
mastery
of
balance
a
pack
can
twist
you
as
suddenly
and
expertly
on
your
back
as
the
best
of
wrestlers
it
has
a
head
lock
on
you
and
you
have
to
go
or
break
your
neck
after
a
time
you
adjust
your
movements
just
as
after
a
time
you
can
travel
on
through
heavy
down
timber
without
taking
conscious
thought
as
to
the
placing
of
your
feet
but
at
first
packing
is
as
near
infernal
punishment
as
merely
mundane
conditions
can
compass
sixteen
muscles
ache
at
first
dully
then
sharply
then
intolerably
until
it
seems
you
can
not
bear
it
another
second
you
are
unable
to
keep
your
feet
a
stagger
means
an
effort
at
recovery
and
an
effort
at
recovery
means
that
you
trip
when
you
place
your
feet
and
that
means
if
you
are
lucky
enough
not
to
be
thrown
an
extra
tweak
for
every
one
of
the
sixteen
new
muscles
at
first
you
rest
every
time
you
feel
tired
then
you
begin
to
feel
very
tired
every
fifty
feet
then
you
have
to
do
the
best
you
can
and
prove
the
pluck
that
is
in
you
tom
friant
an
old
woodsman
of
wide
experience
has
often
told
me
with
relish
of
his
first
try
at
carrying
he
had
about
sixty
pounds
and
his
companion
double
that
amount
friant
stood
it
a
few
centuries
and
then
sat
down
he
could
have
moved
another
step
if
a
gun
had
been
at
his
ear
what
the
matter
asked
his
companion
del
said
friant
i
all
in
i
ca
navigate
here
where
i
quit
ca
you
carry
her
any
farther
not
an
inch
well
pile
her
on
i
carry
her
for
you
friant
looked
at
him
a
moment
in
silent
amazement
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
are
going
to
carry
your
pack
and
mine
too
that
what
i
mean
to
say
i
do
it
if
i
have
to
friant
drew
a
long
breath
well
said
he
at
last
if
a
little
cuss
like
you
can
wiggle
under
a
hundred
and
eighty
i
guess
i
can
make
it
under
sixty
that
right
said
del
imperturbably
you
think
you
can
you
and
i
did
ends
friant
with
a
chuckle
therein
lies
the
whole
secret
the
work
is
irksome
sometimes
even
painful
but
if
you
think
you
can
do
it
you
can
for
though
great
is
the
protest
of
the
human
frame
against
what
it
considers
abuse
greater
is
the
power
of
a
man
grit
we
carried
the
canoe
above
the
larger
eddies
where
we
embarked
ourselves
and
our
packs
for
traverse
leaving
deuce
under
strict
command
to
await
a
second
trip
deuce
disregarded
the
strict
command
from
disobedience
came
great
peril
for
when
he
attempted
to
swim
across
after
us
he
was
carried
downstream
involved
in
a
whirlpool
sucked
under
and
nearly
drowned
we
could
do
nothing
but
watch
when
finally
the
river
spued
out
a
frightened
and
bedraggled
dog
we
drew
a
breath
of
very
genuine
relief
for
deuce
was
dear
to
us
through
much
association
the
canoe
we
turned
bottom
up
and
left
in
the
bushes
and
so
we
set
off
through
the
forest
at
the
end
of
fifteen
minutes
we
began
to
mount
a
gentle
ascent
the
gentle
ascent
speedily
became
a
sharp
slope
the
sharp
slope
an
abrupt
hill
and
the
latter
finally
an
almost
sheer
face
of
rock
and
thin
soil
we
laid
hold
doggedly
of
little
cedars
we
dug
our
fingers
into
little
crevices
and
felt
for
the
same
with
our
toes
we
perspired
in
streams
and
breathed
in
gasps
we
held
the
strained
muscles
of
our
necks
rigid
for
the
twisting
of
a
pack
meant
here
a
dangerous
fall
we
flattened
ourselves
against
the
face
of
the
mountain
with
always
the
heavy
ceaseless
pull
of
the
attempting
to
tear
us
backward
from
our
holds
and
so
at
last
when
the
muscles
of
our
thighs
refused
to
strengthen
our
legs
for
the
ascent
of
another
foot
we
would
turn
our
backs
to
the
slant
and
sink
gratefully
into
the
only
real
luxury
in
the
world
for
be
it
known
that
real
luxury
can
not
be
bought
it
must
be
worked
for
i
refer
to
luxury
as
the
exquisite
savour
of
a
pleasant
sensation
the
keenest
are
undoubtedly
those
of
contrast
in
looking
back
over
a
variety
of
experience
i
have
no
hesitation
at
all
in
selecting
as
the
moment
in
which
i
have
experienced
the
liveliest
physical
pleasure
one
hot
afternoon
in
july
the
thermometer
might
have
stood
anywhere
we
would
have
placed
childlike
trust
in
any
of
its
statements
even
three
figures
great
our
way
had
led
through
unbroken
forest
oppressed
by
low
brush
and
an
underfooting
of
brakes
there
had
been
hills
our
clothes
were
wringing
wet
to
the
last
stitch
even
the
leather
of
the
was
saturated
the
hot
air
we
gulped
down
did
not
seem
to
satisfy
our
craving
for
oxygen
any
more
than
lukewarm
water
ever
seems
to
cut
a
real
thirst
the
woods
were
literally
like
an
oven
in
their
hot
dryness
finally
we
skirted
a
little
hill
and
at
the
base
of
that
hill
a
great
tree
had
fallen
and
through
the
aperture
thus
made
in
the
forest
a
tiny
current
of
cool
air
flowed
like
a
stream
it
was
not
a
great
current
nor
a
wide
if
we
moved
three
feet
in
any
direction
we
were
out
of
it
but
we
sat
us
down
directly
across
its
flow
and
never
have
dinners
or
wines
or
men
or
women
or
talks
of
books
or
scenery
or
adventure
or
sport
or
the
softest
daintiest
refinements
of
man
invention
given
me
the
half
of
luxury
i
drank
in
from
that
little
breeze
so
the
commonest
things
a
dash
of
cool
water
on
the
wrists
a
gulp
of
hot
tea
a
warm
dry
blanket
a
whiff
of
tobacco
a
ray
of
sunshine
are
more
really
the
luxuries
than
all
the
comforts
and
sybaritisms
we
buy
undoubtedly
the
latter
would
also
rise
to
the
higher
category
if
we
were
to
work
for
their
essence
instead
of
merely
signing
club
cheques
or
paying
party
calls
for
them
which
means
that
when
we
three
would
rest
our
packs
against
the
side
of
that
hill
and
drop
our
below
our
chins
we
were
not
at
all
to
be
pitied
even
though
the
forest
growth
denied
us
the
encouragement
of
knowing
how
much
farther
we
had
to
go
before
us
the
trees
dropped
away
rapidly
so
that
twenty
feet
out
in
a
straight
line
we
were
looking
directly
into
their
tops
there
quite
on
an
equality
with
their
own
airy
estate
we
could
watch
the
and
warblers
conducting
their
small
affairs
of
the
chase
it
lent
us
the
illusion
of
imponderability
we
felt
that
we
too
might
be
able
to
rest
securely
on
graceful
gossamer
twigs
and
sometimes
through
a
chance
opening
we
could
see
down
over
billows
of
waving
leaves
to
a
single
little
spot
of
blue
like
a
turquoise
sunk
in
folds
of
green
velvet
which
meant
that
the
river
was
dropping
below
us
this
in
the
mercy
of
the
red
gods
was
meant
as
encouragement
the
time
came
however
when
the
ramparts
we
scaled
rose
sheer
and
bare
in
impregnability
nothing
could
be
done
on
the
straight
line
so
we
turned
sharp
to
the
north
the
way
was
difficult
for
it
lay
over
great
fragments
of
rock
stricken
from
the
cliff
by
winter
and
further
rendered
treacherous
by
the
moss
and
wet
by
a
thousand
trickles
of
water
at
the
end
of
one
hour
we
found
what
might
be
called
a
ravine
if
you
happened
not
to
be
particular
or
a
steep
cleft
in
the
precipice
if
you
were
here
we
deserted
the
open
air
for
brushy
tangles
many
rock
fragments
and
a
choked
streamlet
finally
the
whole
outfit
abruptly
ceased
we
climbed
ten
feet
of
crevices
and
stood
on
the
ridge
the
forest
trees
shut
us
in
our
own
little
area
so
that
we
were
for
the
moment
unable
to
look
abroad
over
the
country
the
descent
abrupt
where
we
had
mounted
stretched
away
gently
toward
the
north
and
west
and
on
that
slope
protected
as
it
was
from
the
severer
storms
that
sweep
up
the
open
valleys
in
winter
stood
the
most
magnificent
primeval
forest
it
has
ever
been
my
fortune
to
behold
the
huge
maple
beech
and
birch
trees
lifted
straight
up
to
a
lucent
green
canopy
always
twinkling
and
shifting
in
the
wind
and
the
sunlight
below
grew
a
thin
screen
of
underbrush
through
which
we
had
no
difficulty
at
all
in
pushing
but
which
threw
about
us
a
tender
green
partition
the
effect
was
that
of
a
pew
in
an
church
so
that
though
we
shared
the
upper
stillnesses
a
certain
delightful
privacy
of
our
own
seemed
assured
us
this
privacy
we
knew
to
be
assured
also
to
many
creatures
besides
ourselves
on
the
other
side
of
the
screen
of
broad
leaves
we
sensed
the
presence
of
life
it
did
not
intrude
on
us
nor
were
we
permitted
to
intrude
on
it
but
it
was
there
we
heard
it
rustling
pattering
scrambling
whispering
scurrying
with
a
rush
of
wings
more
subtly
we
felt
it
as
one
knows
of
a
presence
in
a
darkened
room
by
the
exercise
of
imagination
and
experience
we
identified
it
in
its
manifestations
the
squirrel
the
partridge
the
weasel
the
spruce
hens
once
or
twice
the
deer
we
knew
it
saw
us
perfectly
although
we
could
not
see
it
and
that
gave
us
an
impression
of
companionship
so
the
forest
was
not
lonely
next
to
this
double
sense
of
isolation
and
company
was
the
feeling
of
transparent
shadow
the
forest
was
thick
and
cool
only
rarely
did
the
sun
find
an
orifice
in
the
roof
through
which
to
pour
a
splash
of
liquid
gold
all
the
rest
was
in
shadow
but
the
shadow
was
that
of
the
bottom
of
the
sea
cool
green
and
above
all
transparent
we
saw
into
the
depth
of
it
but
dimly
as
we
would
see
into
the
green
recesses
of
a
tropic
ocean
it
possessed
the
same
liquid
quality
finally
the
illusion
overcame
us
completely
we
bathed
in
the
shadows
as
though
they
were
palpable
and
from
that
came
great
refreshment
under
foot
the
soil
was
springy
with
the
mould
of
numberless
autumns
the
axe
had
never
hurried
slow
old
servant
decay
once
in
a
while
we
came
across
a
prostrate
trunk
lying
in
the
trough
of
destruction
its
fall
had
occasioned
but
the
rest
of
the
time
we
trod
a
carpet
to
the
making
of
which
centuries
of
dead
forest
warriors
had
wrapped
themselves
in
mould
and
soft
moss
and
gentle
dissolution
sometimes
a
faint
rounded
shell
of
former
fair
proportion
swelled
above
the
level
to
crumble
to
punkwood
at
the
lightest
touch
of
our
feet
or
again
the
simulacrum
of
a
tree
trunk
would
bravely
oppose
our
path
only
to
melt
away
into
nothing
like
the
opposing
phantoms
of
aeneas
when
we
placed
a
knee
against
it
for
the
surmounting
if
the
pine
woods
be
characterized
by
cathedral
solemnity
and
the
cedars
and
tamaracks
by
certain
horrifical
gloom
and
the
popples
by
a
silvery
sunshine
and
the
by
grateful
heat
and
the
homely
manner
of
familiar
birds
then
the
great
hardwood
must
be
known
as
the
of
transparent
shadows
of
cool
green
lucency
and
the
repository
of
immemorial
cheerful
forest
tradition
which
the
traveller
can
hear
of
but
which
he
is
never
permitted
actually
to
know
illustration
in
this
lovable
mystery
we
journeyed
all
the
rest
of
that
morning
in
this
lovable
mystery
we
journeyed
all
the
rest
of
that
morning
the
packs
were
heavy
with
the
first
day
weight
and
we
were
tired
from
our
climb
but
the
deep
physical
joy
of
going
on
and
ever
on
into
unknown
valleys
down
a
long
gentle
slope
that
must
lead
somewhere
through
things
animate
and
things
of
an
almost
animate
life
opening
silently
before
us
to
give
us
passage
and
closing
as
silently
behind
us
after
we
had
passed
these
made
us
forget
our
aches
and
fatigues
for
the
moment
at
noon
we
boiled
tea
near
a
little
spring
of
clear
cold
water
as
yet
we
had
no
opportunity
of
seeing
farther
than
the
closing
in
of
many
trees
we
were
as
far
as
external
appearances
went
no
more
advanced
than
our
first
after
surmounting
the
ridge
this
effect
is
constant
in
the
great
forests
you
are
in
a
treadmill
though
a
pleasant
one
withal
your
camp
of
differs
only
in
from
that
of
yesterday
and
your
camp
of
will
probably
be
almost
exactly
like
only
when
you
reach
your
objective
point
do
you
come
to
a
full
realization
that
you
have
not
been
the
sisyphus
of
the
red
gods
deuce
returning
from
exploration
brought
indubitable
evidence
of
porcupines
we
picked
the
barbed
little
weapons
from
his
face
and
nose
and
tongue
with
much
difficulty
for
ourselves
and
much
pain
for
deuce
we
offered
consolation
by
voicing
for
his
dumbness
his
undoubted
intention
to
avoid
all
future
porcupines
then
we
took
up
the
afternoon
tramp
now
at
last
through
the
trees
appeared
the
gleam
of
water
tawabinisáy
had
said
that
kawágama
was
the
only
lake
in
its
district
we
therefore
became
quite
excited
at
this
sapphire
promise
our
packs
were
thrown
aside
and
like
we
raced
down
the
declivity
to
the
shore
xiv
on
walking
through
the
woods
we
found
ourselves
peering
through
the
thicket
at
a
little
reed
and
grass
grown
body
of
water
a
few
acres
in
extent
a
short
detour
to
the
right
led
us
to
an
outlet
a
brook
of
width
and
dash
that
convinced
us
the
little
pond
was
only
a
in
the
stream
and
not
a
headwater
as
we
had
at
first
imagined
then
a
nearer
approach
led
us
past
pointed
exquisitely
chiselled
with
the
marks
of
teeth
so
we
knew
we
looked
not
on
a
natural
pond
but
on
the
work
of
beavers
i
examined
the
dam
more
closely
it
was
a
marvel
of
engineering
skill
in
the
accuracy
with
which
the
big
trees
had
been
felled
exactly
along
the
most
effective
lines
the
efficiency
of
the
filling
in
and
the
just
estimate
of
the
waste
water
to
be
allowed
we
named
the
place
obviously
beaver
pond
resumed
our
packs
and
pushed
on
now
i
must
be
permitted
to
celebrate
by
a
little
the
pluck
of
dick
he
was
quite
unused
to
the
comparatively
inexperienced
in
and
weighed
but
one
hundred
and
pounds
yet
not
once
in
the
course
of
that
trip
did
he
bewail
his
fate
towards
the
close
of
this
first
afternoon
i
dropped
behind
to
see
how
he
was
making
it
the
boy
had
his
head
down
his
lips
shut
tight
together
his
legs
well
straddled
apart
as
i
watched
he
stumbled
badly
over
the
merest
twig
dick
said
i
are
you
tired
yes
he
confessed
frankly
can
you
make
it
another
i
guess
so
i
try
at
the
end
of
the
we
dropped
our
packs
dick
had
manifested
no
impatience
not
once
had
he
even
asked
how
nearly
time
was
up
but
now
he
breathed
a
deep
sigh
of
relief
i
thought
you
were
never
going
to
stop
said
he
simply
from
dick
those
words
meant
a
good
deal
for
differs
as
widely
from
ordinary
walking
as
from
a
good
pedestrian
may
tire
very
quickly
in
the
forest
no
two
successive
steps
are
of
the
same
length
no
two
successive
steps
fall
on
the
same
quality
of
footing
no
two
successive
steps
are
on
the
same
level
those
three
are
the
major
elements
of
fatigue
add
further
the
facts
that
your
way
is
continually
obstructed
both
by
real
difficulties
such
as
trees
trunks
and
rocks
and
lesser
annoyances
such
as
branches
bushes
and
even
these
things
all
combine
against
endurance
the
inexperienced
does
not
know
how
to
meet
them
with
a
minimum
of
effort
the
tenderfoot
is
in
a
constant
state
of
muscular
and
mental
rigidity
against
a
fall
or
a
stumble
or
a
cut
across
the
face
from
some
one
of
the
infinitely
numerous
woods
scourges
this
rigidity
speedily
exhausts
the
vital
force
so
much
for
the
philosophy
of
it
its
practical
side
might
be
infinitely
extended
woodsmen
are
tough
and
enduring
and
in
good
condition
but
no
more
so
than
the
average
college
athlete
time
and
again
i
have
seen
men
of
the
latter
class
walked
to
a
standstill
i
mean
exactly
that
they
knew
and
were
justly
proud
of
their
physical
condition
and
they
hated
to
acknowledge
even
to
themselves
that
the
rest
of
us
were
more
enduring
as
a
consequence
they
played
on
their
nerve
beyond
their
physical
powers
when
the
collapse
came
it
was
complete
i
remember
very
well
a
crew
of
men
turning
out
from
a
lumber
camp
on
the
sturgeon
river
to
bring
in
on
a
litter
a
young
fellow
who
had
given
out
while
attempting
to
follow
bethel
bristol
through
a
hard
day
bristol
said
he
dropped
finally
as
though
he
had
been
struck
on
the
head
the
woodsman
had
thereupon
built
him
a
little
fire
made
him
as
comfortable
as
possible
with
both
coats
and
hiked
for
assistance
i
once
went
into
the
woods
with
a
prominent
college
athlete
we
walked
rather
hard
over
a
rough
country
until
noon
then
the
athlete
lay
on
his
back
for
the
rest
of
the
day
while
i
finished
alone
the
business
we
had
come
on
now
these
instances
do
not
imply
that
bristol
and
certainly
not
myself
were
any
stronger
physically
or
possessed
more
nervous
force
than
the
men
we
had
tired
out
either
of
them
on
a
road
could
have
trailed
us
step
for
step
and
as
long
as
we
pleased
but
we
knew
the
game
it
comes
at
the
last
to
be
entirely
a
matter
of
experience
any
man
can
walk
in
the
woods
all
day
at
some
gait
but
his
speed
will
depend
on
his
skill
it
is
exactly
like
making
your
way
through
heavy
dry
sand
as
long
as
you
restrain
yourself
to
a
certain
leisurely
plodding
you
get
along
without
extraordinary
effort
while
even
a
slight
increase
of
speed
drags
fiercely
at
your
feet
so
it
is
with
the
woods
as
long
as
you
walk
slowly
enough
so
that
you
can
pick
your
footing
and
lift
aside
easily
the
branches
that
menace
your
face
you
will
expend
little
nervous
energy
but
the
slightest
pressing
the
slightest
inclination
to
go
beyond
what
may
be
called
your
physical
foresight
lands
you
immediately
in
difficulties
you
stumble
you
break
through
the
brush
you
shut
your
eyes
to
avoid
sharp
switchings
the
reservoir
of
your
energy
is
open
full
cock
in
about
an
hour
you
feel
very
very
tired
this
principle
holds
rigidly
true
of
every
one
from
the
softest
tenderfoot
to
the
expertest
for
each
there
exists
a
normal
rate
of
travel
beyond
which
are
penalties
only
the
by
long
use
has
raised
the
exponent
of
his
powers
perhaps
as
a
working
hypothesis
the
following
might
be
recommended
good
step
is
worth
six
stumbling
steps
go
only
fast
enough
to
assure
that
good
you
will
learn
besides
a
number
of
things
practically
which
memory
can
not
summon
to
order
for
instance
here
brush
slanted
across
your
path
is
easier
lifted
over
your
head
and
dropped
behind
you
than
pushed
aside
will
do
as
an
example
a
good
progresses
without
apparent
hurry
i
have
followed
the
disappearing
back
of
tawabinisáy
when
as
my
companion
elegantly
expressed
it
if
you
stopped
to
spit
you
got
lost
tawabinisáy
wandered
through
the
forest
his
hands
in
his
pockets
humming
a
little
indian
hymn
and
we
were
breaking
madly
along
behind
him
with
the
crashing
of
many
timbers
of
your
discoveries
probably
one
of
the
most
impressive
will
be
that
in
the
bright
lexicon
of
woodscraft
the
word
mile
has
been
entirely
left
out
to
count
by
miles
is
a
useless
and
ornamental
elegance
of
civilization
some
of
us
once
worked
hard
all
one
day
only
to
camp
three
miles
downstream
from
our
of
the
night
before
and
the
following
day
we
ran
nearly
sixty
with
the
current
the
space
of
measured
country
known
as
a
mile
may
hold
you
five
minutes
or
five
hours
from
your
destination
the
indian
counts
by
time
and
after
a
little
you
follow
his
example
four
miles
to
kettle
portage
means
nothing
two
hours
to
kettle
portage
does
only
when
an
indian
tells
you
two
hours
you
would
do
well
to
count
it
as
four
well
our
trip
practically
amounted
to
seven
days
to
nowhere
or
perhaps
seven
days
to
everywhere
would
be
more
accurate
it
was
all
in
the
high
hills
until
the
last
day
and
a
half
and
generally
in
the
hardwood
forests
twice
we
intersected
and
followed
for
short
distances
indian
trails
neither
of
which
apparently
had
been
travelled
since
the
original
party
that
had
made
them
they
led
across
country
for
greater
or
lesser
distances
in
the
direction
we
wished
to
travel
and
then
turned
aside
three
times
we
blundered
on
little
meadows
of
invariably
they
were
tramped
muddy
like
a
where
the
great
animals
had
stood
as
lately
as
the
night
before
caribou
were
not
uncommon
there
were
a
few
deer
but
not
many
for
the
most
of
the
deer
country
lies
to
the
south
of
this
our
district
partridge
as
we
had
anticipated
lacked
in
such
high
country
in
the
course
of
the
five
days
and
a
half
we
were
in
the
hills
we
discovered
six
lakes
of
various
sizes
the
smallest
was
a
mere
pond
the
largest
would
measure
some
three
or
four
miles
in
diameter
we
came
upon
that
very
late
one
afternoon
a
brook
of
some
size
crossed
our
way
so
as
was
our
habit
we
promptly
turned
upstream
to
discover
its
source
in
the
high
country
the
are
never
more
than
a
few
miles
distant
and
at
the
same
time
the
magnitude
of
this
indicated
a
lake
rather
than
a
spring
as
the
supply
the
lake
might
be
kawágama
our
packs
had
grown
to
be
very
heavy
for
they
had
already
the
weight
of
nine
hours
piled
on
top
and
the
stream
was
exceedingly
difficult
to
follow
it
flowed
in
one
of
those
aggravating
little
ravines
whose
banks
are
too
high
and
steep
and
uneven
for
good
footing
and
whose
beds
are
choked
with
a
too
abundant
growth
in
addition
there
had
fallen
many
trees
over
which
one
had
to
climb
we
kept
at
it
for
perhaps
an
hour
the
brook
continued
of
the
same
size
and
the
country
of
the
same
character
dick
for
the
first
time
suggested
that
it
might
be
well
to
camp
we
got
good
water
here
he
argued
quite
justly
and
we
can
push
on
just
as
well
as
we
balanced
our
packs
against
a
prostrate
billy
contributed
his
indirect
share
to
the
argument
i
lak
to
have
the
job
mak
heem
this
countree
all
over
he
sighed
i
mak
heem
more
level
all
right
i
agreed
you
fellows
sit
here
and
rest
a
minute
and
i
take
a
whirl
a
little
ways
ahead
i
slipped
my
and
started
on
light
after
carrying
a
heavy
pack
so
long
i
seemed
to
tread
on
air
the
thicket
before
so
formidable
amounted
to
nothing
at
all
perhaps
the
consciousness
that
the
day
work
was
in
reality
over
lent
a
little
factitious
energy
to
my
tired
legs
at
any
rate
the
projected
two
hundred
feet
of
my
investigations
stretched
to
a
good
at
the
end
of
that
space
i
debouched
on
a
widening
of
the
ravine
the
hardwood
ran
off
into
cedars
i
pushed
through
the
stiff
rods
and
yielding
fans
of
the
latter
and
all
at
once
found
myself
leaning
out
over
the
waters
of
the
lake
it
was
almost
an
exact
oval
and
lay
in
a
cup
of
hills
three
wooded
islands
swimming
like
ducks
in
the
placid
evening
waters
added
a
touch
of
diversity
a
huge
white
rock
balanced
the
composition
to
the
left
and
a
single
white
like
a
snowflake
against
pines
brooded
on
its
top
i
looked
abroad
to
where
the
perfect
reflection
of
the
hills
confused
the
shore
line
i
looked
down
through
five
feet
of
crystal
water
to
where
pebbles
shimmered
in
refraction
i
noted
the
low
rocks
jutting
from
the
wood
shelter
whereon
one
might
stand
to
cast
a
fly
then
i
turned
and
yelled
and
yelled
and
yelled
again
at
the
forest
billy
came
through
the
brush
crashing
in
his
haste
he
looked
long
and
comprehendingly
without
further
speech
we
turned
back
to
where
dick
was
guarding
the
packs
that
youth
we
found
profoundly
indifferent
kawágama
we
cried
a
ahead
he
turned
on
us
a
eye
you
going
to
camp
here
he
inquired
dully
course
not
we
go
on
and
camp
at
the
lake
all
right
he
replied
we
resumed
our
packs
a
little
stiffly
and
reluctantly
for
we
had
tasted
of
without
them
at
the
lake
we
rested
going
to
camp
here
inquired
dick
we
looked
about
but
noted
that
the
ground
under
the
cedars
was
hummocky
and
that
the
hardwood
grew
on
a
slope
besides
we
wanted
to
camp
as
near
the
shore
as
possible
probably
a
trifle
further
along
there
would
be
a
point
of
high
land
and
delightful
little
no
we
answered
cheerfully
this
is
much
good
suppose
we
push
along
a
ways
and
find
something
better
all
right
dick
replied
we
walked
perhaps
a
more
to
the
westward
before
we
discovered
what
we
wanted
stopping
from
time
to
time
to
discuss
the
merits
of
this
or
that
place
billy
and
i
were
feeling
pretty
good
after
such
a
week
kawágama
was
a
tonic
finally
we
agreed
this
do
said
we
thank
god
said
dick
unexpectedly
and
dropped
his
pack
to
the
ground
with
a
thud
and
sat
on
it
i
looked
at
him
closely
then
i
undid
my
own
pack
billy
said
i
start
in
on
grub
never
mind
the
tent
just
now
a
right
grinned
billy
he
had
been
making
his
own
observations
dick
said
i
let
go
down
and
sit
on
the
rock
over
the
water
we
might
fish
a
little
all
right
dick
replied
he
stumbled
dully
after
me
to
the
shore
dick
i
continued
you
a
kid
and
you
have
high
principles
and
your
mother
would
like
it
but
i
going
to
prescribe
for
you
and
i
going
to
insist
on
your
following
the
prescription
this
flask
does
not
contain
that
in
the
other
flask
it
contains
whisky
i
have
had
it
in
my
pack
since
we
started
and
it
has
not
been
opened
i
do
believe
in
whisky
in
the
woods
not
because
i
am
temperance
but
because
a
man
ca
travel
on
it
but
here
is
where
you
break
your
principles
drink
dick
hesitated
then
he
drank
by
the
time
grub
was
ready
his
vitality
had
come
to
normal
and
so
he
was
able
to
digest
his
food
and
get
some
good
out
of
it
otherwise
he
could
not
have
done
so
thus
he
furnished
an
admirable
example
of
the
only
real
use
for
whisky
in
also
it
was
the
nearest
dick
ever
came
to
being
completely
played
out
that
evening
was
delightful
we
sat
on
the
rock
and
watched
the
long
north
country
twilight
steal
up
like
a
gray
cloud
from
the
east
two
loons
called
to
each
other
now
in
the
shrill
maniac
laughter
now
with
the
long
mournful
cry
it
needed
just
that
one
touch
to
finish
the
picture
we
were
looking
had
we
but
known
it
on
a
lake
no
white
man
had
ever
visited
before
clement
alone
had
seen
kawágama
so
in
our
ignorance
we
attained
much
the
same
mental
attitude
for
i
may
as
well
let
you
into
the
secret
this
was
not
the
fabled
lake
after
all
we
found
that
out
later
from
tawabinisáy
but
it
was
beautiful
enough
and
wild
enough
and
strange
enough
in
its
splendid
wilderness
isolation
to
fill
the
heart
of
the
explorer
with
a
great
content
having
thus
as
we
thought
attained
the
primary
object
of
our
explorations
we
determined
on
trying
now
for
the
second
that
is
the
investigation
of
the
upper
reaches
of
the
river
trout
we
had
not
accomplished
at
this
lake
but
the
existence
of
fish
of
some
sort
was
attested
by
the
presence
of
the
two
loons
and
the
gull
so
we
laid
our
to
fisherman
luck
after
two
false
starts
we
managed
to
strike
into
a
good
country
near
enough
our
direction
the
travel
was
much
the
same
as
before
the
second
day
however
we
came
to
a
surveyor
cut
through
the
woods
then
we
followed
that
as
a
matter
of
convenience
the
cut
the
fall
before
was
the
only
evidence
of
man
we
saw
in
the
high
country
it
meant
nothing
in
itself
but
was
intended
as
a
for
the
township
surveys
whenever
the
country
should
become
civilized
enough
to
warrant
them
that
condition
of
affairs
might
not
occur
for
years
to
come
therefore
the
line
was
cut
out
clear
for
a
width
of
twenty
feet
we
continued
along
it
as
along
a
trail
until
we
discovered
our
last
lake
a
body
of
water
possessing
many
radiating
arms
this
was
the
nearest
we
came
to
the
real
kawágama
if
we
had
skirted
the
lake
mounted
the
ridge
followed
a
mounted
another
ridge
and
descended
a
slope
we
should
have
made
our
discovery
later
we
did
just
that
under
the
guidance
of
tawabinisáy
himself
floating
in
the
birch
canoe
we
carried
with
us
we
looked
back
at
the
very
spot
on
which
we
stood
this
morning
but
we
turned
sharp
to
the
left
and
so
missed
our
chance
however
we
were
in
a
happy
frame
of
mind
for
we
imagined
we
had
really
made
the
desired
discovery
nothing
of
moment
happened
until
we
reached
the
valley
of
the
river
then
we
found
we
were
treed
we
had
been
travelling
all
the
time
among
hills
and
valleys
to
be
sure
but
on
a
high
elevation
even
the
bottom
lands
in
which
lay
the
lakes
were
several
hundred
feet
above
superior
now
we
emerged
from
the
forest
to
find
ourselves
on
bold
mountains
at
least
seven
or
eight
hundred
feet
above
the
main
valley
and
in
the
main
valley
we
could
make
out
the
river
it
was
rather
dizzy
work
three
or
four
times
we
ventured
over
the
rounded
crest
of
the
hill
only
to
return
after
forty
or
fifty
feet
because
the
slope
had
become
too
abrupt
this
grew
to
be
monotonous
and
aggravating
it
looked
as
though
we
might
have
to
parallel
the
course
like
scouts
watching
an
army
on
the
top
of
the
hill
finally
a
little
ravine
gave
us
hope
we
scrambled
down
it
ended
in
a
very
steep
slant
and
finished
at
a
sheer
tangle
of
the
latter
we
attempted
billy
went
on
ahead
i
let
the
packs
down
to
him
by
means
of
a
he
balanced
them
on
roof
until
i
had
climbed
below
him
and
so
on
it
was
exactly
like
letting
a
bucket
down
a
well
if
one
of
the
packs
had
slipped
off
the
it
would
have
dropped
like
a
plummet
to
the
valley
and
landed
on
heaven
knows
what
the
same
might
be
said
of
ourselves
we
did
this
because
we
were
angry
all
through
then
we
came
to
the
end
of
the
right
and
left
offered
nothing
below
was
a
sheer
bare
drop
absolutely
nothing
remained
but
to
climb
back
heavy
packs
and
all
to
the
top
of
the
mountain
false
hopes
had
wasted
a
good
half
day
and
innumerable
billy
and
i
saw
red
we
bowed
our
heads
and
snaked
those
packs
to
the
top
of
the
mountain
at
a
gait
that
ordinarily
would
have
tired
us
out
in
fifty
feet
dick
did
not
attempt
to
keep
up
when
we
reached
the
top
we
sat
down
to
wait
for
him
after
a
while
he
appeared
climbing
leisurely
he
gazed
on
us
from
behind
the
mask
of
his
indian
imperturbability
then
he
grinned
that
did
us
good
for
we
all
three
laughed
aloud
and
buckled
down
to
business
in
a
better
frame
of
mind
that
day
we
discovered
a
most
beautiful
waterfall
a
stream
about
twenty
feet
in
width
and
with
a
good
volume
of
water
dropped
some
three
hundred
feet
or
more
into
the
river
it
was
across
the
valley
from
us
so
we
had
a
good
view
of
its
beauties
our
estimates
of
its
height
were
carefully
made
on
the
basis
of
some
standing
pine
that
grew
near
its
foot
and
then
we
entered
a
steep
little
ravine
and
descended
it
with
misgivings
to
a
cañon
and
walked
easily
down
the
cañon
to
a
slope
that
took
us
by
barely
sensible
gradations
to
a
wooded
plain
at
six
we
stood
on
the
banks
of
the
river
and
the
hills
were
behind
us
of
our
travel
there
is
little
really
to
be
said
we
established
a
number
of
facts
that
the
river
dashes
most
scenically
from
rapid
to
rapid
so
that
the
stagnant
pool
theory
is
henceforth
untenable
that
the
hills
get
higher
and
wilder
the
farther
you
penetrate
to
the
interior
and
their
cliffs
and
bolder
and
more
naked
that
there
are
trout
in
the
upper
reaches
but
not
so
large
as
in
the
lower
pools
and
above
all
that
travel
is
not
a
joy
for
ever
for
we
could
not
ford
the
river
above
the
falls
it
is
too
deep
and
swift
as
a
consequence
we
had
often
to
climb
often
to
break
through
the
narrowest
thicket
strips
and
once
to
feel
our
way
cautiously
along
a
sunken
ledge
under
a
sheer
rock
cliff
that
was
billy
idea
we
came
to
the
sheer
rock
cliff
after
a
pretty
hard
scramble
and
we
were
most
loth
to
do
the
necessary
climbing
billy
suggested
that
we
might
be
able
to
wade
as
the
pool
below
the
cliff
was
black
water
and
of
indeterminate
depth
we
scouted
the
idea
billy
however
poked
around
with
a
stick
and
as
i
have
said
discovered
a
little
ledge
about
a
foot
and
a
half
wide
and
about
two
feet
and
a
half
below
the
surface
this
was
spectacular
but
we
did
it
a
slip
meant
a
swim
and
the
loss
of
the
pack
we
did
not
happen
to
slip
shortly
after
we
came
to
the
big
falls
and
so
after
further
painful
experiment
descended
joyfully
into
known
country
the
freshet
had
gone
down
the
weather
had
warmed
the
sun
shone
we
caught
trout
for
lunch
below
the
big
falls
everything
was
lovely
by
three
after
thrice
wading
the
stream
we
regained
our
canoe
now
at
least
forty
feet
from
the
water
we
paddled
across
deuce
followed
easily
where
a
week
before
he
had
been
sucked
down
and
nearly
drowned
we
opened
the
cache
and
changed
our
very
garments
we
cooked
ourselves
a
luxurious
meal
we
built
a
and
at
last
we
stretched
our
tired
bodies
full
length
on
balsam
a
foot
thick
and
gazed
drowsily
at
the
moon
before
sinking
to
a
dreamless
sleep
xv
on
woods
indians
far
in
the
north
dwell
a
people
practically
unknown
to
any
but
the
and
the
explorer
our
information
as
to
mokis
sioux
cheyennes
nez
percés
and
indirectly
many
others
through
the
pages
of
cooper
parkman
and
allied
writers
is
varied
enough
so
that
our
ideas
of
indians
are
pretty
well
established
if
we
are
romantic
we
hark
back
to
the
past
and
invent
with
ourselves
anent
the
noble
red
man
who
has
passed
away
if
we
are
severely
practical
we
take
notice
of
filth
vice
tin
cans
and
laziness
in
fact
we
might
divide
all
indian
concepts
into
two
classes
following
these
mental
and
imaginative
bents
then
we
should
have
quite
simply
and
satisfactorily
the
cooper
indian
and
the
comic
paper
indian
it
must
be
confessed
that
the
latter
is
often
approximated
by
reality
and
everybody
knows
it
that
the
former
is
by
no
means
a
myth
at
least
in
many
qualities
the
average
reader
might
be
pardoned
for
doubting
some
time
ago
i
desired
to
increase
my
knowledge
of
the
woods
indians
by
whatever
others
had
accomplished
accordingly
i
wrote
to
the
ethnological
department
at
washington
asking
what
had
been
done
in
regard
to
the
ojibways
and
wood
crees
north
of
lake
superior
the
answer
was
nothing
and
nothing
is
more
nearly
a
comprehensive
answer
than
at
first
you
might
believe
visitors
at
mackinac
traverse
sault
ste
marie
and
other
northern
resorts
are
besought
at
certain
times
of
the
year
by
silent
squaws
to
purchase
basket
and
bark
work
if
the
tourist
happens
to
follow
these
women
for
more
wholesale
examination
of
their
wares
he
will
be
led
to
a
with
sails
half
pulled
out
on
the
beach
in
the
stern
sit
two
or
three
bucks
wearing
shirts
jean
trousers
and
broad
black
hats
some
of
the
oldest
men
may
sport
a
patched
pair
of
moccasins
or
so
but
most
are
conventional
enough
in
clumsy
shoes
after
a
longer
or
shorter
stay
they
hoist
their
red
sails
and
drift
away
toward
some
mysterious
destination
on
the
north
shore
if
the
buyer
is
curious
enough
and
persistent
enough
he
may
elicit
the
fact
that
they
are
ojibways
now
if
this
same
tourist
happens
to
possess
a
mildly
venturesome
disposition
a
and
a
chart
of
the
region
he
will
sooner
or
later
blunder
across
the
of
his
silent
vendors
at
the
foot
of
some
bay
he
will
come
on
a
diminutive
village
of
small
whitewashed
log
houses
it
will
differ
from
other
villages
in
that
the
houses
are
arranged
with
no
reference
whatever
to
one
another
but
in
the
haphazard
fashion
of
an
encampment
its
inhabitants
are
his
summer
friends
if
he
is
of
an
insinuating
address
he
may
get
a
glimpse
of
their
daily
life
then
he
will
go
away
firmly
convinced
that
he
knows
quite
a
lot
about
the
north
woods
indian
and
so
he
does
but
this
north
woods
indian
is
the
reservation
indian
and
in
the
north
a
reservation
indian
is
as
different
from
a
woods
indian
as
a
negro
is
from
a
chinese
suppose
on
the
other
hand
your
tourist
is
unfortunate
enough
to
get
left
at
some
north
woods
railway
station
where
he
has
descended
from
the
transcontinental
to
stretch
his
legs
and
suppose
him
to
have
happened
on
a
like
missináibie
at
the
precise
time
when
the
trappers
are
in
from
the
wilds
near
the
borders
of
the
village
he
will
come
upon
a
little
encampment
of
conical
tepees
at
his
approach
the
women
and
children
will
disappear
into
inner
darkness
a
dozen
dogs
will
rush
out
barking
men
will
respond
silently
to
his
salutation
these
men
he
will
be
interested
to
observe
wear
still
the
deer
or
moose
skin
moccasin
the
lightest
and
easiest
for
the
woods
bind
their
long
hair
with
a
narrow
fillet
and
their
waists
with
a
red
or
striped
worsted
sash
keep
warm
under
the
blanket
thickness
of
a
hudson
bay
capote
and
deck
their
clothes
with
a
variety
of
barbaric
ornament
he
will
see
about
camp
weapons
whose
acquaintance
he
has
made
only
in
museums
peltries
of
whose
identification
he
is
by
no
means
sure
and
as
matters
of
daily
use
bark
canoes
bows
and
arrows
what
to
him
have
been
articles
of
ornament
or
curiosity
these
people
will
be
gone
for
another
year
carrying
with
them
the
results
of
the
week
barter
neither
he
nor
his
kind
will
see
them
again
unless
they
too
journey
far
into
the
silent
places
but
he
has
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
stolid
mask
of
the
woods
indian
concerning
whom
officially
nothing
is
known
in
many
respects
the
woods
indian
is
the
legitimate
descendant
of
the
cooper
indian
his
life
is
led
entirely
in
the
forests
his
subsistence
is
assured
by
hunting
fishing
and
trapping
his
dwelling
is
the
wigwam
and
his
habitation
the
wide
reaches
of
the
wilderness
lying
between
lake
superior
and
the
hudson
bay
his
relation
to
humanity
confined
to
intercourse
with
his
own
people
and
acquaintance
with
the
men
who
barter
for
his
peltries
so
his
dependence
is
not
on
the
world
the
white
man
has
brought
but
on
himself
and
his
natural
environment
civilization
has
merely
ornamented
his
ancient
manner
it
has
given
him
the
convenience
of
cloth
of
firearms
of
steel
traps
of
iron
kettles
of
matches
it
has
accustomed
him
to
the
luxuries
of
white
sugar
though
he
had
always
his
own
maple
product
tea
flour
and
white
man
tobacco
that
is
about
all
he
knows
nothing
of
whisky
the
towns
are
never
visited
by
him
and
the
hudson
bay
company
will
sell
him
no
liquor
his
concern
with
you
is
not
great
for
he
has
little
to
gain
from
you
this
people
then
depending
on
natural
resources
for
subsistence
has
retained
to
a
great
extent
the
qualities
of
the
early
aborigines
to
begin
with
it
is
distinctly
nomadic
the
great
rolls
of
birch
bark
to
cover
the
pointed
tepees
are
easily
transported
in
the
bottoms
of
canoes
and
the
poles
are
quickly
cut
and
put
in
place
as
a
consequence
the
ojibway
family
is
always
on
the
move
it
searches
out
new
new
fisheries
it
pays
visits
it
seems
even
to
enjoy
travel
for
the
sake
of
exploration
in
winter
a
tepee
of
double
wall
is
built
whose
hollow
is
stuffed
with
moss
to
keep
out
the
cold
but
even
that
approximation
of
permanence
can
not
stand
against
the
slightest
convenience
when
an
indian
kills
often
he
does
not
transport
his
game
to
camp
but
moves
his
camp
to
the
vicinity
of
the
carcass
there
are
of
these
woods
dwellers
no
villages
no
permanent
clearings
the
vicinity
of
a
hudson
bay
post
is
sometimes
occupied
for
a
month
or
so
during
the
summer
but
that
is
all
an
obvious
corollary
of
this
is
that
tribal
life
does
not
consistently
obtain
throughout
the
summer
months
when
game
and
fur
are
at
their
poorest
the
bands
assemble
probably
at
the
times
of
barter
with
the
traders
then
for
the
short
period
of
the
idling
season
they
drift
together
up
and
down
the
north
country
streams
or
camp
for
big
and
conjuring
near
some
pleasant
conflux
of
rivers
but
when
the
first
frosts
nip
the
leaves
the
families
separate
to
their
allotted
trapping
districts
there
to
spend
the
winter
in
pursuit
of
the
real
business
of
life
the
tribe
is
thus
split
into
many
groups
ranging
in
numbers
from
the
solitary
trapper
eager
to
win
enough
fur
to
buy
him
a
wife
to
a
compact
little
group
of
three
or
four
families
closely
related
in
blood
the
most
striking
consequence
is
that
unlike
other
indian
bodies
politic
there
are
no
regularly
constituted
and
acknowledged
chiefs
certain
individuals
gain
a
remarkable
reputation
and
an
equally
remarkable
respect
for
wisdom
or
hunting
skill
or
power
of
woodcraft
or
travel
these
men
are
the
old
men
often
mentioned
in
indian
manifestoes
though
age
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
deference
accorded
them
tawabinisáy
is
not
more
than
years
old
peter
our
hudson
bay
indian
is
hardly
more
than
a
boy
yet
both
are
obeyed
implicitly
by
whomever
they
happen
to
be
with
both
lead
the
way
by
river
or
trail
and
both
where
question
arises
are
sought
in
advice
by
men
old
enough
to
be
their
fathers
perhaps
this
is
as
good
a
democracy
as
another
the
life
so
briefly
hinted
at
in
the
foregoing
lines
inevitably
develops
and
fosters
an
expertness
of
woodcraft
almost
beyond
belief
the
ojibway
knows
his
environment
the
forest
is
to
him
so
familiar
in
each
and
every
one
of
its
numerous
and
subtle
aspects
that
the
slightest
departure
from
the
normal
strikes
his
attention
at
once
a
patch
of
brown
shadow
where
green
shadow
should
fall
a
shimmering
of
leaves
where
should
be
merely
a
gentle
waving
a
where
the
usual
forest
growth
should
adumbrate
a
flash
of
wings
at
a
time
of
day
when
feathered
creatures
ordinarily
rest
quiet
these
and
hundreds
of
others
which
you
and
i
should
never
even
guess
at
force
themselves
as
glaringly
on
an
indian
notice
as
a
brass
band
in
a
city
street
a
white
man
for
game
an
indian
sees
it
because
it
differs
from
the
forest
that
is
of
course
a
matter
of
long
experience
and
lifetime
habit
were
it
a
question
merely
of
this
the
white
man
might
also
in
time
attain
the
same
skill
but
the
indian
is
a
better
animal
his
senses
are
appreciably
sharper
than
our
own
in
journeying
down
the
kapúskasíng
river
our
indians
who
had
come
from
the
woods
to
guide
us
always
saw
game
long
before
we
did
they
would
never
point
it
out
to
us
the
bow
of
the
canoe
would
swing
silently
in
its
direction
there
to
rest
motionless
until
we
indicated
we
had
seen
something
where
is
it
peter
i
would
whisper
but
peter
always
remained
contemptuously
silent
one
evening
we
paddled
directly
into
the
eye
of
the
setting
sun
across
a
shallow
little
lake
filled
with
hardly
sunken
boulders
there
was
no
current
and
no
breath
of
wind
to
stir
the
water
into
betraying
riffles
but
invariably
those
indians
twisted
the
canoe
into
a
new
course
ten
feet
before
we
reached
one
of
the
obstructions
whose
existence
our
dazzled
vision
could
not
attest
until
they
were
actually
below
us
they
those
rocks
through
the
shimmer
of
the
surface
glare
another
time
i
discovered
a
small
black
animal
lying
flat
on
a
point
of
shale
its
head
was
concealed
behind
a
boulder
and
it
was
so
far
away
that
i
was
inclined
to
congratulate
myself
on
having
differentiated
it
from
the
shadow
what
is
it
peter
i
asked
peter
hardly
glanced
at
it
dog
he
replied
now
we
were
a
hundred
miles
south
of
the
hudson
bay
post
and
two
weeks
north
of
any
other
settlement
saving
a
horse
a
dog
would
be
about
the
last
thing
to
occur
to
one
in
guessing
at
the
identity
of
any
strange
animal
this
looked
like
a
little
black
blotch
without
form
yet
peter
knew
it
it
was
a
dog
lost
from
some
indian
and
mightily
glad
to
see
us
the
sense
of
smell
too
is
developed
to
an
extent
positively
uncanny
to
us
who
have
needed
it
so
little
your
woods
indian
is
always
sniffing
always
testing
the
impressions
of
other
senses
by
his
olfactories
instances
numerous
and
varied
might
be
cited
but
probably
one
will
do
as
well
as
a
dozen
it
once
became
desirable
to
kill
a
caribou
in
country
where
the
animals
are
not
at
all
abundant
tawabinisáy
volunteered
to
take
jim
within
shot
of
one
jim
describes
their
hunt
as
the
most
wonderful
bit
of
stalking
he
had
ever
seen
the
indian
followed
the
animal
tracks
as
easily
as
you
or
i
could
have
followed
them
over
snow
he
did
this
rapidly
and
certainly
every
once
in
a
while
he
would
get
down
on
all
fours
to
sniff
inquiringly
at
the
crushed
herbage
always
on
rising
to
his
feet
he
would
give
the
result
of
his
investigations
caribou
one
hour
and
later
half
hour
or
again
quarter
hour
and
finally
over
nex
hill
and
it
was
so
in
like
manner
but
most
remarkable
to
us
because
the
test
of
direct
comparison
with
our
own
sense
was
permitted
us
was
their
acuteness
of
hearing
often
while
jumping
a
roaring
rapids
in
two
canoes
my
companion
and
i
have
heard
our
men
talking
to
each
other
in
quite
an
ordinary
tone
of
voice
that
is
to
say
i
could
hear
my
indian
and
jim
could
hear
his
but
personally
we
were
forced
to
shout
loudly
to
carry
across
the
noise
of
the
stream
the
distant
approach
of
animals
they
announce
accurately
wawashkeshí
deer
says
peter
and
sure
enough
after
an
interval
we
too
could
distinguish
the
footfalls
on
the
dry
leaves
as
both
cause
and
consequence
of
these
physical
endowments
which
place
them
nearly
on
a
parity
with
the
game
itself
they
are
most
expert
hunters
every
sportsman
knows
the
importance
and
also
the
difficulty
of
discovering
game
before
it
discovers
him
the
indian
has
here
an
immense
advantage
and
after
game
is
discovered
he
is
furthermore
most
expert
in
approaching
it
with
all
the
refined
art
of
the
still
hunter
caspar
whitney
describes
in
exasperation
his
experience
with
the
indians
of
the
far
he
complains
that
when
they
blunder
on
game
they
drop
everything
and
enter
into
almost
hopeless
chase
two
legs
against
four
occasionally
the
quarry
becomes
enough
bewildered
so
that
the
wild
shooting
will
bring
it
down
he
quite
justly
argues
that
the
merest
pretence
at
caution
in
approach
would
result
in
much
greater
success
the
woods
indian
is
no
such
fool
he
is
a
mighty
poor
shot
and
he
knows
it
personally
i
believe
he
shuts
both
eyes
before
pulling
trigger
he
is
armed
with
a
long
flint
or
percussion
lock
musket
whose
barrel
is
bound
to
the
wood
that
runs
its
entire
length
by
means
of
brass
bands
and
whose
effective
range
must
be
about
ten
yards
this
archaic
implement
is
known
as
a
trade
gun
and
has
the
single
merit
of
never
getting
out
of
order
furthermore
ammunition
is
precious
in
consequence
the
wilderness
hunter
is
not
going
to
be
merely
pretty
sure
he
intends
to
be
absolutely
certain
if
he
can
not
approach
near
enough
to
blow
a
hole
in
his
prey
he
does
not
fire
i
have
seen
peter
drop
into
so
thin
that
apparently
we
could
discern
the
surface
of
the
ground
through
it
and
disappear
so
completely
that
our
most
earnest
attention
could
not
distinguish
even
a
rustling
of
the
herbage
after
an
interval
his
gun
would
go
off
from
some
distant
point
exactly
where
some
ducks
had
been
feeding
serenely
oblivious
to
fate
neither
of
us
white
men
would
have
considered
for
a
moment
the
possibility
of
getting
any
of
them
once
i
felt
rather
proud
of
myself
for
killing
six
ruffed
grouse
out
of
some
trees
with
the
pistol
until
peter
drifted
in
carrying
three
he
had
bagged
with
a
stick
another
interesting
phase
of
this
almost
perfect
correspondence
to
environment
is
the
readiness
with
which
an
indian
will
meet
an
emergency
we
are
accustomed
to
rely
first
of
all
on
the
skilled
labour
of
some
one
we
can
hire
second
if
we
undertake
the
job
ourselves
on
the
tools
made
for
us
by
skilled
labour
and
third
on
the
shops
to
supply
us
with
the
materials
we
may
need
not
once
in
a
lifetime
are
we
thrown
entirely
on
our
own
resources
then
we
improvise
bunglingly
a
makeshift
the
woods
indian
possesses
his
knife
and
his
light
axe
nails
planes
glue
chisels
vices
cord
rope
and
all
the
rest
of
it
he
has
to
do
without
but
he
never
improvises
makeshifts
no
matter
what
the
exigency
or
how
complicated
the
demand
his
experience
answers
with
accuracy
utensils
and
tools
he
knows
exactly
where
to
find
his
job
is
neat
and
workmanlike
whether
it
is
a
bark
receptacle
or
not
a
pair
of
the
repairing
of
a
canoe
the
construction
of
a
shelter
or
the
fashioning
of
a
paddle
about
noon
one
day
tawabinisáy
broke
his
square
off
this
to
us
would
have
been
a
serious
affair
probably
we
should
left
to
ourselves
have
stuck
in
some
sort
of
a
rough
straight
sapling
handle
which
would
have
answered
well
enough
until
we
could
have
bought
another
by
the
time
we
had
cooked
dinner
that
indian
had
fashioned
another
helve
we
compared
it
with
the
store
article
it
was
as
well
shaped
as
smooth
as
nicely
balanced
in
fact
as
we
laid
the
new
and
the
old
side
by
side
we
could
not
have
selected
from
any
evidence
of
the
workmanship
which
had
been
made
by
machine
and
which
by
hand
tawabinisáy
then
burned
out
the
wood
from
the
axe
retempered
the
steel
set
the
new
helve
and
wedged
it
neatly
with
ironwood
wedges
the
whole
affair
including
the
cutting
of
the
timber
consumed
perhaps
half
an
hour
to
travel
with
a
woods
indian
is
a
constant
source
of
delight
on
this
account
so
many
little
things
that
the
white
man
does
without
because
he
will
not
bother
with
their
transportation
the
indian
makes
for
himself
and
so
quickly
and
easily
i
have
seen
a
thoroughly
waterproof
commodious
and
comfortable
bark
shelter
made
in
about
the
time
it
would
take
one
to
pitch
a
tent
i
have
seen
a
raft
built
of
cedar
logs
and
cedar
bark
ropes
in
an
hour
i
have
seen
a
canoe
made
as
good
as
new
in
fifteen
minutes
the
indian
rarely
needs
to
hunt
for
the
materials
he
requires
he
knows
exactly
where
they
grow
and
he
turns
as
directly
to
them
as
a
clerk
would
turn
to
his
shelves
no
problem
of
the
living
of
physical
life
is
too
obscure
to
have
escaped
his
varied
experience
you
may
travel
with
indians
for
years
and
learn
something
new
and
delightful
as
to
how
to
take
care
of
yourself
every
summer
the
qualities
i
have
mentioned
come
primarily
from
the
fact
that
the
woods
indian
is
a
hunter
i
have
now
to
instance
two
whose
development
can
be
traced
to
the
other
fact
that
he
is
a
nomad
i
refer
to
his
skill
with
the
bark
canoe
and
his
ability
to
carry
i
was
once
introduced
to
a
man
at
a
little
way
station
of
the
canadian
pacific
railway
in
the
following
words
shake
hands
with
munson
he
as
good
a
canoeman
as
an
indian
a
little
later
one
of
the
bystanders
remarked
to
me
that
fellow
you
was
just
talking
with
is
as
good
a
canoeman
as
an
injun
still
later
at
an
entirely
different
place
a
member
of
the
bar
informed
me
in
the
course
of
discussion
the
only
man
i
know
of
who
can
do
it
is
named
munson
he
is
as
good
a
canoeman
as
an
indian
at
the
time
this
unanimity
of
praise
puzzled
me
a
little
i
thought
i
had
seen
some
pretty
good
canoe
work
and
even
cherished
a
mild
conceit
that
occasionally
i
could
keep
right
side
up
myself
i
knew
munson
to
be
a
great
with
many
striking
qualities
and
why
this
of
canoemanship
should
be
so
insistently
chosen
above
the
others
was
beyond
my
comprehension
subsequently
a
companion
and
i
journeyed
to
hudson
bay
with
two
birch
canoes
and
two
indians
since
that
trip
i
have
had
a
vast
respect
for
munson
undoubtedly
among
the
and
white
guides
of
lower
canada
maine
and
the
adirondacks
are
many
skilful
men
but
they
know
their
waters
they
follow
a
beaten
track
the
woods
indian
well
let
me
tell
you
something
of
what
he
does
we
went
down
the
kapúskasíng
river
to
the
mattágami
and
then
down
that
to
the
moose
these
rivers
are
at
first
but
a
hundred
feet
or
so
wide
but
rapidly
swell
with
the
influx
of
numberless
smaller
streams
two
days
journey
brings
you
to
a
watercourse
nearly
half
a
mile
in
breadth
two
weeks
finds
you
on
a
surface
approximately
a
mile
and
a
half
across
all
this
water
descends
from
the
height
of
land
to
the
sea
level
it
does
so
through
a
rock
country
the
result
is
a
series
of
roaring
dashing
boulder
rapids
and
waterfalls
that
would
make
your
hair
stand
on
end
merely
to
contemplate
from
the
banks
the
regular
route
to
moose
factory
is
by
the
missinaíbie
our
way
was
new
and
strange
no
trails
no
knowledge
of
the
country
when
we
came
to
a
stretch
of
white
water
the
indians
would
rise
to
their
feet
for
a
single
instant
searching
examination
of
the
stretch
of
tumbled
water
before
them
in
that
moment
they
picked
the
passage
they
were
to
follow
as
well
as
a
white
man
could
have
done
so
in
half
an
hour
study
then
without
hesitation
they
shot
their
little
craft
at
the
green
water
from
that
time
we
merely
tried
to
sit
still
each
in
his
canoe
each
indian
did
it
all
with
his
single
paddle
he
seemed
to
possess
absolute
control
over
his
craft
even
in
the
rush
of
water
which
seemed
to
hurry
us
on
at
almost
railroad
speed
he
could
stop
for
an
instant
work
directly
sideways
shoot
forward
at
a
slant
swing
either
his
bow
or
his
stern
an
error
in
judgment
or
in
the
instantaneous
acting
upon
it
meant
a
hit
and
a
hit
in
these
savage
north
country
rivers
meant
destruction
how
my
man
kept
in
his
mind
the
passage
he
had
planned
during
his
momentary
inspection
was
always
to
me
a
miracle
how
he
got
so
unruly
a
beast
as
the
birch
canoe
to
follow
it
in
that
tearing
volume
of
water
was
always
another
big
boulders
he
dodged
eddies
he
took
advantage
of
slants
of
current
he
utilized
a
fractional
second
of
hesitation
could
not
be
permitted
him
but
always
the
clutching
of
white
hands
from
the
rip
at
the
eddy
finally
conveyed
to
my
faculties
that
the
rapid
was
safely
astern
and
this
mind
you
in
strange
waters
occasionally
we
would
carry
our
outfit
through
the
woods
while
the
indians
would
shoot
some
especially
bad
water
in
the
light
canoe
as
a
spectacle
nothing
could
be
finer
the
flash
of
the
yellow
bark
the
movement
of
the
broken
waters
the
gleam
of
the
paddle
the
tense
alertness
of
the
men
figures
their
carven
passive
faces
with
the
contrast
of
the
flashing
eyes
and
the
distended
nostrils
then
the
leap
into
space
over
some
the
smash
of
spray
the
exultant
yells
of
the
canoemen
for
your
indian
enjoys
the
game
thoroughly
and
it
requires
very
bad
water
indeed
to
make
him
take
to
the
brush
this
is
of
course
the
spectacular
but
also
in
the
ordinary
gray
business
of
canoe
travel
the
woods
indian
shows
his
superiority
he
is
tireless
and
composed
as
to
wrist
and
shoulder
of
a
number
of
springs
from
early
dawn
to
dewy
eve
and
then
a
few
gratuitous
hours
into
the
night
he
will
dig
energetic
holes
in
the
water
with
his
long
narrow
blade
and
every
stroke
counts
the
water
boils
out
in
a
splotch
of
white
the
little
suction
holes
pirouette
like
the
fabric
of
the
craft
itself
trembles
under
the
power
of
the
stroke
jim
and
i
used
in
the
lake
stretches
to
amuse
ourselves
and
probably
the
indians
by
paddling
in
furious
rivalry
one
against
the
other
then
peter
would
make
up
his
mind
he
would
like
to
speak
to
jacob
his
canoe
would
shoot
up
alongside
as
though
the
old
man
of
the
lake
had
laid
his
hand
across
its
stern
would
i
could
catch
that
trick
of
easy
tireless
speed
i
know
it
lies
somewhat
in
keeping
both
elbows
always
straight
and
stiff
in
a
lurch
forward
of
the
shoulders
at
the
end
of
the
stroke
but
that
and
more
perhaps
one
needs
a
copper
skin
and
beady
black
eyes
with
surface
lights
nor
need
you
hope
to
pole
a
canoe
upstream
as
do
these
people
tawabinisáy
uses
two
short
poles
one
in
either
hand
kneels
amidships
and
snakes
that
little
old
canoe
of
his
upstream
so
fast
that
you
would
swear
the
rapids
an
easy
matter
until
you
tried
them
yourself
we
were
once
trailed
up
a
river
by
an
old
woods
indian
and
his
interesting
family
the
outfit
consisted
of
canoe
number
one
one
old
injin
one
boy
of
eight
years
one
dog
canoe
number
two
one
old
injin
squaw
one
girl
of
eighteen
or
twenty
one
dog
canoe
number
three
two
little
girls
of
ten
and
twelve
one
dog
we
tried
desperately
for
three
days
to
get
away
from
this
party
it
did
not
seem
to
work
hard
at
all
we
did
even
the
two
little
girls
appeared
to
dip
the
contemplative
paddle
from
time
to
time
water
boiled
back
of
our
own
blades
we
started
early
and
quit
late
and
about
as
we
congratulated
ourselves
over
our
evening
fire
that
we
had
distanced
our
followers
at
last
those
three
canoes
would
steal
silently
and
calmly
about
the
lower
bend
to
draw
ashore
below
us
in
ten
minutes
the
old
indian
was
delivering
an
oration
to
us
squatted
in
resignation
the
red
gods
alone
know
what
he
talked
about
he
had
no
english
and
our
ojibway
was
of
the
strictly
utilitarian
but
for
an
hour
he
would
hold
forth
we
called
him
the
great
indian
chief
then
he
would
drop
a
mild
hint
for
sáymon
which
means
tobacco
and
depart
by
ten
the
next
morning
he
and
his
people
would
overtake
us
in
spite
of
our
earlier
start
usually
we
were
in
the
act
of
dragging
our
canoe
through
an
especially
vicious
rapid
by
means
of
a
their
three
canoes
even
to
the
children
would
ascend
easily
by
means
of
poles
appeared
to
be
unsportsmanlike
like
then
the
entire
nine
including
the
dogs
would
roost
on
rocks
and
watch
critically
our
methods
the
incident
had
one
value
however
it
showed
us
just
why
these
people
possess
the
marvellous
canoe
skill
i
have
attempted
to
sketch
the
little
boy
in
the
leading
canoe
was
not
over
eight
or
nine
years
of
age
but
he
had
his
little
paddle
and
his
little
and
what
is
more
he
already
used
them
intelligently
and
well
as
for
the
little
girls
well
they
did
easily
feats
i
never
hope
to
emulate
and
that
without
removing
the
coverings
from
their
heads
and
shoulders
the
same
early
habitude
probably
accounts
for
their
ability
to
carry
weights
long
distances
the
woods
indian
is
not
a
mighty
man
physically
most
of
them
are
straight
and
well
built
but
of
only
medium
height
and
not
wonderfully
muscled
peter
was
most
beautiful
but
in
the
fashion
of
the
flying
mercury
with
long
smooth
panther
muscles
he
looked
like
uncas
especially
when
his
keen
was
fixed
in
distant
attention
but
i
think
i
could
have
wrestled
peter
down
yet
time
and
again
i
have
seen
that
indian
carry
two
hundred
pounds
for
some
miles
through
a
rough
country
absolutely
without
trails
and
once
i
was
witness
of
a
feat
of
tawabinisáy
when
that
wily
savage
portaged
a
pack
of
fifty
pounds
and
a
canoe
through
a
hill
country
for
four
hours
and
ten
minutes
without
a
rest
tawabinisáy
is
even
smaller
than
peter
so
much
for
the
qualities
developed
by
the
woods
life
let
us
now
examine
what
may
be
described
as
the
inherent
characteristics
of
the
people
xvi
on
woods
indians
it
must
be
understood
of
course
that
i
offer
you
only
the
best
of
my
subject
a
people
counts
for
what
it
does
well
also
i
instance
men
of
standing
in
the
loose
indian
body
politic
a
traveller
can
easily
discover
the
reverse
of
the
medal
these
have
their
shirks
their
their
men
of
small
account
just
as
do
other
races
i
have
no
thought
of
glorifying
the
noble
red
man
nor
of
claiming
for
him
a
freedom
from
human
imperfection
even
where
his
natural
quality
and
training
count
the
most
greater
than
enlightenment
has
been
able
to
reach
in
my
experience
the
honesty
of
the
woods
indian
is
of
a
very
high
order
the
sense
of
and
is
strongly
forced
by
the
exigencies
of
the
north
woods
life
a
man
is
always
on
the
move
he
is
always
exploring
the
unknown
countries
manifestly
it
is
impossible
for
him
to
transport
the
entire
sum
of
his
worldly
effects
the
implements
of
winter
are
a
burden
in
summer
also
the
return
journey
from
distant
shores
must
be
provided
for
by
to
be
relied
on
the
solution
of
these
needs
is
the
cache
and
the
cache
is
not
a
literal
term
at
all
it
nothing
rather
does
it
hold
aloft
in
prominence
for
the
inspection
of
all
who
pass
what
the
owner
has
seen
fit
to
leave
behind
a
heavy
platform
high
enough
from
the
ground
to
frustrate
the
investigations
of
animals
is
all
that
is
required
visual
concealment
is
unnecessary
because
in
the
north
country
a
cache
is
sacred
on
it
may
depend
the
life
of
a
man
he
who
leaves
provisions
must
find
them
on
his
return
for
he
may
reach
them
starving
and
the
length
of
his
may
depend
on
his
certainty
of
relief
at
this
point
on
his
so
men
passing
touch
not
his
hoard
for
some
day
they
may
be
in
the
same
fix
and
a
precedent
is
a
bad
thing
illustration
nor
need
you
hope
to
pole
a
canoe
upstream
as
do
these
people
thus
in
parts
of
the
wildest
countries
of
northern
canada
i
have
unexpectedly
come
upon
a
birch
canoe
in
capsized
suspension
between
two
trees
or
a
whole
bunch
of
depending
beneath
the
fans
of
a
spruce
or
a
tangle
of
steel
traps
thrust
into
the
crevice
of
a
or
a
supply
of
pork
and
flour
swathed
like
an
egyptian
mummy
occupying
stately
a
high
bier
these
things
we
have
passed
by
reverently
as
symbols
of
a
people
trust
in
its
kind
the
same
sort
of
honesty
holds
in
regard
to
smaller
things
i
have
never
hesitated
to
leave
in
my
camp
firearms
utensils
valuable
from
a
woods
point
of
view
even
a
watch
or
money
not
only
have
i
never
lost
anything
in
that
manner
but
once
an
indian
lad
followed
me
some
miles
after
the
morning
start
to
restore
to
me
a
trout
flies
i
had
accidentally
left
behind
it
might
be
readily
inferred
that
this
quality
carries
over
into
the
subtleties
as
indeed
is
the
case
macdonald
of
brunswick
house
once
discussed
with
me
the
system
of
credits
carried
on
by
the
bay
company
with
the
trappers
each
family
is
advanced
goods
to
the
value
of
two
hundred
dollars
with
the
understanding
that
the
debt
is
to
be
paid
from
the
season
catch
i
should
think
you
would
lose
a
good
deal
i
ventured
nothing
could
be
easier
than
for
an
indian
to
take
his
two
hundred
dollars
worth
and
disappear
in
the
woods
you
never
be
able
to
find
him
macdonald
reply
struck
me
for
the
man
had
twenty
years
trading
experience
i
have
never
said
he
in
a
long
woods
life
known
but
one
indian
liar
this
my
own
limited
has
proved
to
be
true
to
a
sometimes
almost
ridiculous
extent
the
most
trivial
statement
of
fact
can
be
relied
on
provided
it
is
given
outside
of
trade
or
enmity
or
absolute
indifference
the
indian
loves
to
fool
the
tenderfoot
but
a
sober
measured
statement
you
can
conclude
is
accurate
and
if
an
indian
promises
a
thing
he
will
accomplish
it
he
expects
you
to
do
the
same
watch
your
lightest
words
carefully
and
you
would
retain
the
respect
of
your
red
associates
on
our
way
to
the
hudson
bay
we
rashly
asked
peter
towards
the
last
when
we
should
reach
moose
factory
he
deliberated
said
he
things
went
wrong
thursday
supplied
a
head
wind
we
had
absolutely
no
interest
in
reaching
moose
factory
next
day
the
next
week
would
have
done
as
well
but
peter
deaf
to
expostulation
entreaty
and
command
kept
us
travelling
from
six
in
the
morning
until
after
twelve
at
night
we
could
get
him
to
stop
finally
he
drew
the
canoes
ashore
quarter
hour
said
he
he
had
kept
his
word
the
ojibway
possesses
a
great
pride
which
the
unthinking
can
ruffle
quite
unconsciously
in
many
ways
consequently
the
woods
indian
is
variously
described
as
a
good
guide
or
a
bad
one
the
difference
lies
in
whether
you
suggest
or
command
peter
you
got
to
make
chicawgun
get
a
move
on
you
will
bring
you
sullen
service
and
probably
breed
kicks
on
the
grub
supply
which
is
the
immediate
precursor
of
mutiny
peter
it
a
long
way
to
chicawgun
do
you
think
we
make
him
on
the
other
hand
will
earn
you
at
least
a
serious
consideration
of
the
question
and
if
peter
says
you
can
you
will
for
the
proper
man
the
ojibway
takes
a
great
pride
in
his
woodcraft
the
neatness
of
his
camps
the
savoury
quality
of
his
cookery
the
expedition
of
his
travel
the
size
of
his
packs
the
patience
of
his
endurance
on
the
other
hand
he
can
be
as
sullen
inefficient
stupid
and
vindictive
as
any
man
of
any
race
on
earth
i
suppose
the
faculty
of
getting
along
with
men
is
largely
inherent
certainly
it
is
blended
of
many
subtleties
to
be
friendly
to
retain
respect
to
praise
to
preserve
authority
to
direct
and
yet
to
leave
detail
to
exact
what
is
due
and
yet
to
deserve
it
these
be
the
qualities
of
a
leader
and
can
not
be
taught
in
general
the
woods
indian
is
sober
he
can
not
get
whisky
regularly
to
be
sure
but
i
have
often
seen
the
better
class
of
ojibways
refuse
a
drink
saying
that
they
did
not
care
for
it
he
starves
well
and
keeps
going
on
nothing
long
after
hope
is
vanished
he
is
patient
yea
very
patient
under
toil
and
so
accomplishes
great
journeys
overcomes
great
difficulties
and
does
great
deeds
by
means
of
this
handmaiden
of
genius
according
to
his
own
standards
is
he
clean
to
be
sure
his
baths
are
not
numerous
nor
his
many
but
he
never
cooks
until
he
has
washed
his
hands
and
arms
to
the
very
shoulders
other
details
would
but
corroborate
the
impression
of
this
instance
that
his
ideas
differ
from
ours
as
is
his
right
but
that
he
lives
up
to
his
ideas
also
is
he
hospitable
expecting
nothing
in
return
after
your
canoe
is
afloat
and
your
paddle
in
the
river
two
or
three
of
his
youngsters
will
splash
in
after
you
to
toss
silver
fish
to
your
necessities
and
so
always
he
will
wait
until
this
last
moment
of
departure
in
order
that
you
will
not
feel
called
on
to
give
him
something
in
return
which
is
true
tact
and
kindliness
and
worthy
of
high
praise
perhaps
i
have
not
strongly
enough
insisted
that
the
indian
nations
differ
as
widely
from
one
another
as
do
unallied
races
we
found
this
to
be
true
even
in
the
comparatively
brief
journey
from
chapleau
to
moose
after
pushing
through
a
trackless
wilderness
without
having
laid
eyes
on
a
human
being
excepting
the
single
instance
of
three
french
going
heaven
knows
where
we
were
anticipating
pleasurably
our
encounter
with
the
traders
at
the
factory
and
naturally
supposed
that
peter
and
jacob
would
be
equally
pleased
at
the
chance
of
visiting
with
their
own
kind
not
at
all
when
we
reached
moose
our
ojibways
wrapped
themselves
in
a
mantle
of
dignity
and
stalked
scornful
amidst
obsequious
clans
for
the
ojibway
is
great
among
indians
verily
much
greater
than
the
moose
river
crees
had
it
been
a
question
of
rupert
river
crees
with
their
fierce
their
and
their
pagan
customs
the
affair
might
have
been
different
for
mark
you
the
moose
river
cree
is
little
among
hunters
and
he
conducts
the
chase
miscellaneously
over
his
district
without
thought
to
the
preservation
of
the
beaver
and
he
works
in
the
hay
marshes
during
the
summer
and
is
short
squab
and
dirty
and
generally
the
old
sacred
tribal
laws
which
are
better
than
a
religion
because
they
are
practically
adapted
to
northern
life
have
among
them
been
allowed
to
lapse
travellers
they
are
none
nor
do
their
trappers
get
far
from
the
company
so
they
inbreed
ignobly
for
lack
of
outside
favour
and
are
dying
from
the
face
of
the
land
through
dire
diseases
just
as
their
reputations
have
already
died
from
men
respect
the
great
unwritten
law
of
the
forest
is
that
save
as
provision
during
legitimate
travel
one
may
not
hunt
in
his
neighbour
district
each
trapper
has
assigned
him
or
gets
by
inheritance
or
purchase
certain
territorial
power
in
his
land
he
alone
may
trap
he
knows
the
how
many
animals
each
harbours
how
large
a
catch
each
will
stand
without
diminution
of
the
supply
so
the
fur
is
made
to
last
in
the
southern
district
this
division
is
tacitly
agreed
upon
it
is
not
etiquette
to
poach
what
would
happen
to
a
poacher
no
one
knows
simply
because
the
necessity
for
finding
out
has
not
arisen
tawabinisáy
controls
from
batchawanúng
to
agawa
there
old
waboos
takes
charge
and
so
on
but
in
the
far
north
the
control
is
more
often
disputed
and
there
the
still
holds
an
illegal
trapper
baits
his
snares
with
his
life
if
discovered
he
is
summarily
shot
so
is
the
game
preserved
the
woods
indian
never
kills
the
mere
presence
of
game
does
not
breed
in
him
a
lust
to
slaughter
something
moderation
you
learn
of
him
first
of
all
later
provided
you
are
with
him
long
enough
and
your
mind
is
open
to
mystic
influence
you
will
feel
the
strong
impress
of
his
idea
that
the
animals
of
the
forest
are
not
lower
than
man
but
only
different
man
is
an
animal
living
the
life
of
the
forest
the
beasts
are
also
a
body
politic
speaking
a
different
language
and
with
different
amik
the
beaver
has
certain
ideas
as
to
the
conduct
of
life
certain
habits
of
body
and
certain
bias
of
thought
his
scheme
of
things
is
totally
at
variance
with
that
held
by
the
wolf
but
even
to
us
whites
the
two
are
on
a
parity
man
has
still
another
system
one
is
no
better
than
another
they
are
merely
different
and
just
as
preys
on
amik
so
does
man
kill
for
his
own
uses
thence
are
curious
customs
a
rupert
river
cree
will
not
kill
a
bear
unless
he
the
hunter
is
in
gala
attire
and
then
not
until
he
has
made
a
short
speech
in
which
he
assures
his
victim
that
the
affair
is
not
one
of
personal
enmity
but
of
expedience
and
that
anyway
he
the
bear
will
be
better
off
in
the
hereafter
and
then
the
skull
is
cleaned
and
set
on
a
pole
near
running
water
there
to
remain
during
twelve
moons
also
at
the
of
a
beaver
is
tied
a
thong
braided
of
red
wool
and
deerskin
and
many
other
curious
habitudes
which
would
be
of
slight
interest
here
likewise
do
they
conjure
up
by
means
of
racket
and
fasting
the
familiar
spirits
of
distant
friends
or
enemies
and
on
these
spirits
fasten
a
blessing
or
a
curse
from
this
it
may
be
deduced
that
missionary
work
has
not
been
as
thorough
as
might
be
hoped
that
is
true
the
woods
indian
loves
to
sing
and
possesses
quaint
melodies
or
rather
intonations
of
his
own
but
especially
does
he
delight
in
the
wail
of
some
of
our
hymns
the
church
oftenest
reaches
him
through
them
i
know
nothing
stranger
than
the
sight
of
a
little
church
filled
with
indians
swaying
unctuously
to
and
fro
in
the
rhythm
of
a
cadence
old
watts
would
have
recognized
with
difficulty
the
religious
feeling
of
the
performance
is
not
remarkable
but
perhaps
it
does
as
a
exactly
how
valuable
the
average
missionary
work
is
i
have
been
puzzled
to
decide
perhaps
the
church
needs
more
intelligence
in
the
men
it
sends
out
the
evangelist
is
usually
filled
with
narrow
preconceived
notions
as
to
the
proper
physical
life
he
squeezes
his
savage
into
log
houses
boiled
shirts
and
boots
when
he
has
succeeded
in
getting
his
tuberculosis
crop
well
started
he
offers
as
compensation
a
doctrinal
religion
admirably
adapted
to
us
who
have
within
reach
of
perceptions
a
thousand
of
the
subtler
associations
a
savage
can
know
nothing
about
if
there
is
enough
glitter
and
tin
steeple
and
office
and
gilt
card
to
it
the
red
man
pagan
heart
is
tickled
in
its
vanity
and
he
dies
in
the
odour
of
sanctity
and
of
a
filth
his
life
has
never
taught
him
how
to
avoid
the
indian
is
like
a
raccoon
in
his
proper
surroundings
he
is
clean
morally
and
physically
because
he
knows
how
to
be
so
but
in
a
cage
he
is
filthy
because
he
does
not
know
how
to
be
otherwise
i
must
not
be
understood
as
condemning
missionary
work
only
the
stupid
missionary
work
one
most
often
sees
in
the
north
surely
christianity
should
be
adaptable
enough
in
its
little
things
to
fit
any
people
with
its
great
it
seems
hard
for
some
men
to
believe
that
it
is
not
essential
for
a
real
christian
to
wear
a
one
god
love
kindness
charity
honesty
right
living
may
thrive
as
well
in
the
wigwam
as
in
a
foursquare
house
provided
you
let
them
wear
moccasins
and
a
wherewith
to
keep
themselves
warm
and
vital
tawabinisáy
must
have
had
his
religious
training
at
the
hands
of
a
good
man
he
had
lost
none
of
his
aboriginal
virtue
and
skill
as
may
be
gathered
from
what
i
have
before
said
of
him
and
had
gained
in
addition
certain
of
the
gentle
qualities
i
have
never
been
able
to
gauge
exactly
the
extent
of
his
religious
for
tawabinisáy
is
a
silent
individual
and
possesses
very
little
english
but
i
do
know
that
his
religious
was
deep
and
reverent
he
never
swore
in
english
he
did
not
drink
he
never
travelled
or
hunted
or
fished
on
sunday
when
he
could
possibly
help
it
these
virtues
he
wore
modestly
and
unassumingly
as
an
accustomed
garment
yet
he
was
the
most
gloriously
natural
man
i
have
ever
met
the
main
reliance
of
his
formalism
when
he
was
off
in
the
woods
seemed
to
be
a
little
tattered
volume
which
he
perused
diligently
all
sunday
and
wrapped
carefully
in
a
strip
of
oiled
paper
during
the
rest
of
the
week
one
day
i
had
a
chance
to
look
at
this
book
while
its
owner
was
away
after
spring
water
every
alternate
page
was
in
the
phonetic
indian
symbols
of
which
more
hereafter
the
rest
was
in
french
and
evidently
a
translation
although
the
volume
was
of
roman
catholic
origin
creed
was
conspicuously
subordinated
to
the
needs
of
the
class
it
aimed
to
reach
a
confession
of
faith
quite
simple
in
one
god
a
saviour
a
mother
of
heaven
a
number
of
biblical
extracts
rich
in
imagery
and
applicability
to
the
experience
of
a
a
dozen
simple
prayers
of
the
kind
the
natural
man
would
oftenest
find
occasion
to
express
a
prayer
for
sickness
for
bounty
for
fair
weather
for
ease
of
travel
for
the
smiling
face
of
providence
and
then
some
hymns
to
me
the
selection
seemed
most
judicious
it
answered
the
needs
of
tawabinisáy
habitual
experiences
and
so
the
red
man
was
a
good
and
consistent
convert
irresistibly
i
was
led
to
contemplate
the
idea
of
any
one
trying
to
get
tawabinisáy
to
live
in
a
house
to
cut
cordwood
with
an
axe
to
roost
on
a
hard
bench
under
a
tin
steeple
to
wear
stiff
shoes
and
to
quit
forest
roaming
the
written
language
mentioned
above
you
will
see
often
in
the
northland
whenever
an
indian
band
camps
it
blazes
a
tree
and
leaves
as
record
for
those
who
may
follow
a
message
written
in
the
phonetic
character
i
do
not
understand
exactly
the
philosophy
of
it
but
i
gather
that
each
sound
has
a
symbol
of
its
own
like
shorthand
and
that
therefore
even
totally
different
languages
such
as
ojibway
the
wood
cree
or
the
hudson
bay
eskimos
may
all
be
written
in
the
same
character
it
was
invented
nearly
a
hundred
years
ago
by
a
priest
so
simple
is
it
and
so
needed
a
method
of
intercommunication
that
its
use
is
now
practically
universal
even
the
youngsters
understand
it
for
they
are
early
instructed
in
its
mysteries
during
the
long
winter
evenings
on
the
preceding

a
message
i
copied
from
a
spruce

indicates
exactly
the

able
to
estimate
by
noting
how
far
beyond
the
spot
the

points
to
the
sun
has
travelled
how
long
a

another

its

full
of
decided
lisping
and
sustained
hissing
sounds
it
is
spoken
with
somewhat
of
a
drawl
we
always
had
a
fancy
that
somehow
it
was
of
forest
growth
and
that
its
syllables
were
intended
in
the

to
blend
with

just
as
the

of
the

blend
with

the
ojibways
describe
in
monosyllables
many
ideas
we
could
express
only
in
phrase
they
have
a
single
word
for
the
notion
our
lair
form
do
not
mean
exactly
that
its
genius
moreover
inclines
to
a
flexible
by
which
adjectives
and
substantives
are
often
absorbed
into
the
verb
itself
so
that
one
beautiful
singing
word
will
convey
a
whole
paragraph
of
information
my
little
knowledge
of
it
is
so
entirely
empirical
that
it
can
possess
small
value
in
concluding
these
desultory
remarks
i
want
to
tell
you
of
a
very
curious
survival
among
the
ojibways
and
ottawas
of
the
georgian
bay
it
seems
that
some
hundreds
of
years
ago
these
ordinarily
peaceful
folk
descended
on
the
iroquois
in
what
is
now
new
york
and
massacred
a
village
or
so
then
like
small
boys
who
have
thrown
only
too
accurately
at
the
delivery
wagon
they
scuttled
back
home
again
since
that
time
they
have
lived
in
deadly
fear
of
retribution
the
iroquois
have
long
since
disappeared
from
the
face
of
the
earth
but
even
the
georgian
bay
indians
are
subject
to
periodical
spasms
of
terror
some
and
imaginative
youth
sees
at
sunset
a
canoe
far
down
the
horizon
immediately
the
villages
are
abandoned
in
haste
and
the
entire
community
moves
up
to
the
of
streams
there
to
lurk
until
convinced
that
all
danger
is
past
it
does
no
good
to
tell
these
benighted
savages
that
they
are
safe
from
vengeance
at
least
in
this
world
the
dreaded
name
of
iroquois
is
potent
even
across
the
centuries
xvii
the
catching
of
a
certain
fish
we
settled
down
peacefully
on
the
river
and
the
weather
after
so
much
enmity
was
kind
to
us
likewise
did
the
flies
disappear
from
the
woods
utterly
each
morning
we
arose
as
the
red
gods
willed
generally
early
when
the
sun
was
just
gilding
the
peaks
to
the
westward
but
not
too
early
before
the
white
veil
had
left
the
river
billy
with
contempt
for
economy
hewed
great
logs
and
burned
them
nobly
in
the
cooking
of
trout
oatmeal
pancakes
and
the
like
we
had
constructed
ourselves
tables
and
benches
between
green
trees
and
there
we
ate
and
great
was
the
eating
beyond
the
official
capacity
of
the
human
stomach
there
offered
little
things
to
do
delicious
little
things
just
on
the
hither
side
of
idleness
a
rod
wrapping
needed
more
waxed
silk
a
favourite
fly
required
attention
to
prevent
dissolution
the
pistol
was
to
be
cleaned
a
seemed
desirable
a
trifle
more
of
balsam
could
do
no
harm
clothes
might
stand
drying
blankets
airing
we
accomplished
these
things
leisurely
pausing
for
the
telling
of
stories
for
the
puffing
of
pipes
for
the
sheer
joy
of
contemplations
deerskin
slipper
moccasins
and
flapping
trousers
attested
our
deshabille
and
then
somehow
it
was
noon
and
billy
again
at
the
dutch
oven
and
the
broiler
trout
we
ate
and
always
more
trout
big
fellows
broiled
with
strips
of
bacon
craftily
sewn
in
and
out
of
the
pink
flesh
medium
fellows
cut
into
steaks
little
fellows
fried
crisp
in
big
medium
and
little
fellows
mingled
in
component
of
the
famous
north
country
whose
other
ingredients
are
partridges
and
tomatoes
and
potatoes
and
onions
and
salt
pork
and
flour
in
combination
delicious
beyond
belief
nor
ever
did
we
tire
of
them
three
times
a
day
printed
statement
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding
and
besides
were
many
crafty
dishes
over
whose
construction
the
major
portion
of
morning
idleness
was
spent
now
at
two
we
groaned
temporary
little
groans
and
crawled
shrinking
into
our
river
clothes
which
we
dared
not
hang
too
near
the
fire
for
fear
of
the
disintegrating
scorch
and
drew
on
soggy
hobnailed
shoes
with
holes
cut
in
the
bottom
and
plunged
with
howls
of
disgust
into
the
upper
riffles
then
the
cautious
passage
of
the
swift
current
during
which
we
forgot
for
ever
which
eternity
alone
circles
the
bliss
of
an
afternoon
on
the
river
the
chill
of
the
water
and
so
came
to
the
trail
now
at
the
idiot
delight
dick
and
i
parted
company
by
three
i
came
again
to
the
river
far
up
halfway
to
the
big
falls
deuce
watched
me
gravely
with
the
first
click
of
the
reel
he
retired
to
the
brush
away
from
the
back
cast
there
to
remain
until
the
pool
was
fished
and
we
could
continue
our
journey
in
the
swift
leaping
water
at
the
smooth
back
of
the
eddy
in
the
white
foam
under
the
dark
cliff
shadow
here
there
everywhere
the
bright
flies
drop
softly
like
strange
snowflakes
the
game
is
as
interesting
as
to
hit
the
mark
that
is
enough
and
then
a
swirl
of
water
and
a
broad
lazy
tail
wake
you
to
the
fact
that
other
matters
are
yours
verily
the
fish
of
the
north
country
are
mighty
beyond
all
others
over
the
river
rests
the
sheen
of
light
over
the
hills
rests
the
sheen
of
romance
the
land
is
enchanted
birds
dip
and
sway
advance
and
retreat
leaves
toss
their
hands
in
greeting
or
bend
and
whisper
one
to
the
other
splashes
of
sun
fall
heavy
as
metal
through
the
yielding
screens
of
branches
little
breezes
wander
hesitatingly
here
and
there
to
sink
like
spent
kites
on
the
nearest
bar
of
shingle
the
stream
shouts
and
gurgles
murmurs
hushes
lies
still
and
secret
as
though
to
warn
you
to
discretion
breaks
away
with
a
shriek
of
hilarity
when
your
discretion
has
been
assured
there
is
in
you
a
great
leisure
as
though
the
day
would
never
end
there
is
in
you
a
great
keenness
one
part
of
you
is
vibrantly
alive
your
wrist
muscles
contract
almost
automatically
at
the
swirl
of
a
rise
and
the
hum
of
life
along
the
gossamer
of
your
line
gains
its
communication
with
every
nerve
in
your
body
the
question
of
gear
and
method
you
attack
what
fly
montreal
parmachenee
belle
royal
coachman
silver
doctor
professor
brown
hackle
these
grand
lures
for
the
north
country
trout
receive
each
its
due
test
and
attention
and
on
the
tail
snell
what
fisherman
has
not
the
gamble
the
unusual
obscure
multinamed
fly
which
may
in
the
occultism
of
his
taste
attract
the
big
fellows
besides
there
remains
always
the
handling
does
your
trout
fancy
the
skittering
of
his
food
or
the
withdrawal
in
three
jerks
or
the
sinking
of
the
fly
does
he
want
it
across
current
or
up
current
will
he
rise
with
a
snap
or
is
he
going
to
come
slowly
or
is
he
going
to
play
these
be
problems
interesting
insistent
to
be
solved
with
the
ready
test
within
the
reach
of
your
skill
but
that
alertness
is
only
one
side
of
your
mood
no
matter
how
difficult
the
selection
how
strenuous
the
fight
there
is
in
you
a
large
feeling
that
might
almost
be
described
as
buddhistic
time
has
nothing
to
do
with
your
problems
the
world
has
quietly
run
down
and
has
been
embalmed
with
all
its
sweetness
of
light
and
colour
and
sound
in
a
warm
lethe
bath
of
sun
this
afternoon
is
going
to
last
for
ever
you
note
and
enjoy
and
savour
the
little
pleasures
unhurried
by
the
thought
that
anything
else
whether
of
pleasure
or
duty
is
to
follow
and
so
for
long
delicious
eons
the
river
flows
on
ever
on
the
hills
watch
watch
always
the
birds
sing
the
sun
shines
grateful
across
your
shoulders
the
big
trout
and
the
little
rise
in
predestined
order
and
make
their
predestined
fight
and
go
their
predestined
way
either
to
liberty
or
the
creel
the
pools
and
the
rapids
and
the
riffles
slip
by
upstream
as
though
they
had
been
withdrawn
rather
than
as
though
you
had
advanced
then
suddenly
the
day
has
dropped
its
wings
the
earth
moves
forward
with
a
jar
things
are
to
be
accomplished
things
are
being
accomplished
the
river
is
hurrying
down
to
the
lake
the
birds
have
business
of
their
own
to
attend
to
an
it
please
you
the
hills
are
waiting
for
something
that
has
not
yet
happened
but
they
are
ready
startled
you
look
up
the
afternoon
has
finished
your
last
step
has
taken
you
over
the
edge
of
the
shadow
cast
by
the
setting
sun
across
the
range
of
hills
for
the
first
time
you
look
about
you
to
see
where
you
are
it
has
not
mattered
before
now
you
know
that
shortly
it
will
be
dark
still
remain
below
you
four
pools
a
great
haste
seizes
you
if
i
take
my
rod
apart
and
strike
through
the
woods
you
argue
i
can
make
the
narrows
and
i
am
sure
there
is
a
big
trout
there
why
the
narrows
should
be
any
more
likely
to
contain
a
big
trout
than
any
of
the
other
three
pools
you
would
not
be
able
to
explain
in
half
an
hour
it
will
be
dark
you
hurry
in
the
forest
it
is
already
twilight
but
by
now
you
know
the
forest
well
preoccupied
feverish
with
your
great
idea
you
hasten
on
the
birds
silent
all
in
the
brooding
of
night
rise
ghostly
to
right
and
left
shadows
steal
away
like
hostile
spies
among
the
treetrunks
the
silver
of
last
daylight
gleams
ahead
of
you
through
the
brush
you
know
it
for
the
narrows
whither
the
instinct
of
your
eagerness
has
led
you
as
accurately
as
a
compass
through
the
forest
fervently
as
though
this
were
of
world
affairs
the
most
important
you
congratulate
yourself
on
being
in
time
your
rod
seems
to
join
itself
in
a
moment
the
cast
drops
like
a
breath
on
the
molten
silver
nothing
another
try
a
trifle
lower
down
nothing
a
little
wandering
breeze
spoils
your
fourth
attempt
carrying
the
leader
far
to
the
left
curses
deep
and
fervent
the
daylight
is
fading
draining
away
a
fifth
cast
falls
forty
feet
out
slowly
you
drag
the
flies
across
the
current
reluctant
to
recover
until
the
latest
possible
moment
and
so
when
your
rod
is
foolishly
upright
your
line
slack
and
your
flies
motionless
there
rolls
slowly
up
and
over
the
trout
of
trouts
you
see
a
broad
side
the
whirl
of
a
fantail
that
looks
to
you
to
be
at
least
six
inches
across
and
the
current
slides
on
smooth
indifferent
to
the
wild
leap
of
your
heart
illustration
then
in
the
twilight
they
bathe
like
a
crazy
man
you
shorten
your
line
six
seconds
later
your
flies
fall
skilfully
just
upstream
from
where
last
you
saw
that
wonderful
tail
but
six
seconds
may
be
a
long
long
period
of
time
you
have
feared
and
hoped
and
speculated
and
realized
feared
that
the
leviathan
has
pricked
himself
and
so
will
not
rise
again
hoped
that
his
appearance
merely
indicated
curiosity
which
he
will
desire
further
to
satisfy
speculated
on
whether
your
skill
can
drop
the
fly
exactly
on
that
spot
as
it
must
be
dropped
and
realized
that
whatever
be
the
truth
as
to
all
those
fears
and
hopes
and
speculations
this
is
irrevocably
your
last
chance
for
an
instant
you
allow
the
flies
to
drift
downstream
to
be
floated
here
and
there
by
idle
little
eddies
to
be
sucked
down
and
spat
out
of
tiny
then
cautiously
you
draw
them
across
the
surface
of
the
waters
thump
your
heart
slows
up
with
disappointment
then
mysteriously
like
the
stirring
of
the
waters
by
some
invisible
hand
the
molten
silver
is
broken
in
its
smoothness
the
royal
coachman
quietly
disappears
with
all
the
brakes
shrieking
on
your
desire
to
shut
your
eyes
and
heave
a
mighty
heave
you
depress
your
butt
and
strike
then
in
the
twilight
the
battle
no
leisure
is
here
only
quivering
intense
agonized
anxiety
the
affair
transcends
the
moment
purposes
and
necessities
of
untold
ages
have
concentrated
so
that
somehow
back
of
your
consciousness
rest
hosts
of
disembodied
hopes
tendencies
evolutionary
progressions
all
breathless
lest
you
prove
unequal
to
the
struggle
for
which
they
have
been
so
long
preparing
responsibility
vast
vague
formless
is
yours
only
the
fact
that
you
are
wholly
occupied
with
the
exigence
of
the
moment
prevents
your
understanding
of
what
it
is
but
it
hovers
dark
and
depressing
behind
your
possible
failure
you
must
win
this
is
no
fish
it
is
opportunity
itself
and
once
gone
it
will
never
return
the
mysticism
of
lower
dusk
in
the
forest
of
upper
afterglow
on
the
hills
of
the
chill
of
evening
waters
and
winds
of
the
glint
of
strange
phantoms
under
the
darkness
of
cliffs
of
the
whisperings
and
shoutings
of
things
you
are
too
busy
to
identify
out
in
the
gray
of
north
country
awe
all
these
menace
you
with
indeterminate
dread
swift
water
slack
water
downstream
upstream
with
red
eyes
straining
into
the
dimness
with
every
muscle
taut
and
every
nerve
quivering
you
follow
the
ripping
of
your
line
you
have
consecrated
yourself
to
the
uttermost
the
minutes
stalk
by
you
gigantic
you
are
a
stable
in
whirling
phantasms
and
you
are
very
little
very
small
very
inadequate
among
these
titans
of
circumstance
thrice
he
breaks
water
a
white
and
ghostly
apparition
from
the
deep
your
heart
stops
with
your
reel
and
only
resumes
its
office
when
again
the
line
sings
safely
the
darkness
falls
and
with
it
like
the
mysterious
strength
of
sir
gareth
opponent
falls
the
power
of
your
adversary
his
rushes
shorten
the
blown
world
of
your
uncertainty
shrinks
to
the
normal
from
the
haze
of
your
consciousness
as
through
a
fog
loom
the
old
familiar
forest
and
the
hills
and
the
river
slowly
you
creep
from
that
strange
enchanted
land
the
sullen
trout
yields
in
all
gentleness
you
float
him
within
reach
of
your
net
quietly
breathlessly
you
walk
ashore
and
over
the
beach
and
yet
an
unnecessary
hundred
feet
from
the
water
lest
he
retain
still
a
flop
then
you
lay
him
upon
the
stones
and
lift
up
your
heart
in
rejoicing
how
you
get
to
camp
you
never
clearly
know
exultation
lifts
your
feet
wings
wings
o
ye
red
gods
wings
to
carry
the
body
whither
the
spirit
hath
already
soared
and
stooped
and
circled
back
in
impatience
to
see
why
still
the
body
lingers
ordinarily
you
can
cross
the
riffles
above
the
halfway
pool
only
with
caution
and
prayer
and
a
stout
staff
craftily
employed
this
night
you
can
and
do
splash
across
as
recklessly
as
you
would
wade
a
little
brook
there
is
no
stumble
in
you
for
you
have
done
a
great
deed
and
the
red
gods
are
smiling
through
the
trees
glows
a
light
and
in
the
centre
of
that
light
are
leaping
flames
and
in
the
circle
of
that
light
stand
in
orange
the
tent
and
the
table
and
the
waiting
figures
of
your
companions
you
stop
short
and
swallow
hard
and
saunter
into
camp
as
one
indifferent
carelessly
you
toss
aside
your
creel
into
the
darkest
corner
as
though
it
were
unimportant
nonchalantly
you
lean
your
rod
against
the
slant
of
your
tent
wearily
you
seat
yourself
and
begin
to
draw
off
your
drenched
garments
billy
bends
toward
the
fire
dick
gets
you
your
dry
clothes
nobody
says
anything
for
everybody
is
hungry
no
one
asks
you
any
questions
for
on
the
river
you
get
in
almost
any
time
of
night
finally
as
you
are
hanging
your
wet
things
near
the
fire
you
inquire
casually
over
your
shoulder
dick
have
any
luck
dick
tells
you
you
listen
with
apparent
interest
he
has
caught
a
he
describes
the
spot
and
the
method
and
the
struggle
he
is
very
much
pleased
you
pity
him
the
three
of
you
eat
supper
lots
of
supper
billy
arises
first
filling
his
pipe
he
hangs
water
over
the
fire
for
the
you
and
dick
sit
hunched
on
a
log
blissfully
happy
in
the
moments
of
digestion
ruminative
watching
the
blaze
the
tobacco
smoke
eddies
and
sucks
upward
to
join
the
wood
smoke
billy
moves
here
and
there
in
the
fulfilment
of
his
simple
tasks
casting
his
shadow
wavering
and
gigantic
against
the
trees
he
has
finished
he
gathers
up
the
straps
of
dick
creel
and
turns
to
the
shadow
for
your
own

is
going
to
clean

moment
you
have
watched
for
you
shroud
yourself
in
profound
indifference
shrieks
billy
you
do
not
even
turn
your
head
jumping
giraffes
why
it
a
whale
cries
dick
you
roll
a
eye
in
their
direction
as
though
such
puerile
enthusiasm
wearies
you
yes
it
quite
a
little
fish
you
concede
they
swarm
down
upon
you
demanding
particulars
these
you
accord
laconically
a
word
at
a
time
in
answer
to
direct
question
between
puffs
of
smoke
at
the
narrows
royal
coachman
just
before
i
came
in
pretty
fair
fight
just
at
the
edge
of
the
eddy
and
so
on
but
your
soul
glories
the
is
brought
out
inches
it
records
holy
smoke
what
a
fish
your
air
implies
that
you
will
probably
catch
three
more
just
like
him
on
the
morrow
dick
and
billy
make
tracings
of
him
on
the
birch
bark
you
retain
your
lofty
calm
but
inside
you
are
little
quivers
of
rapture
and
when
you
awake
late
in
the
night
you
are
conscious
first
of
all
that
you
are
happy
happy
happy
all
through
and
only
when
the
drowse
drains
away
do
you
remember
why
xviii
man
who
walks
by
moonlight
we
had
been
joined
on
the
river
by
friends
doug
who
never
fished
more
than
forty
rods
from
camp
and
was
always
inventing
patent
indicators
and
other
things
and
who
wore
in
his
soft
slouch
hat
so
many
brilliant
trout
flies
that
he
irresistibly
reminded
you
of
ophelia
dinnis
who
was
large
and
and
bubbling
and
popular
johnny
whose
wide
eyes
looked
for
the
first
time
on
the
and
whose
soul
concealed
itself
behind
assumptions
jim
six
feet
tall
and
three
feet
broad
with
whom
the
season
before
i
had
penetrated
to
hudson
bay
and
finally
doc
tall
granite
experienced
the
best
fisherman
that
ever
hit
the
river
with
these
were
indians
buckshot
a
little
indian
with
a
good
knowledge
of
english
johnnie
challán
a
indian
ugly
furtive
an
efficient
man
about
camp
and
tawabinisáy
himself
this
was
an
honour
due
to
the
presence
of
doc
tawabinisáy
approved
of
doc
that
was
all
there
was
to
say
about
it
after
a
few
days
inevitably
the
question
of
kawágama
came
up
billy
johnnie
challán
and
buckshot
squatted
in
a
and
drew
diagrams
in
the
soft
dirt
with
a
stick
tawabinisáy
sat
on
a
log
and
overlooked
the
proceedings
finally
he
spoke
tawabinisáy
they
always
gave
him
his
full
title
we
called
him
tawáb
tell
me
lake
you
find
he
no
kawágama
translated
buckshot
he
called
black
beaver
lake
ask
him
if
he
take
us
to
kawágama
i
requested
tawabinisáy
looked
very
doubtful
come
on
tawáb
urged
doc
nodding
at
him
vigorously
do
be
a
clam
we
wo
take
anybody
else
up
there
the
indian
probably
did
not
comprehend
the
words
but
he
liked
doc
he
pronounced
laboriously
buckshot
explained
to
us
his
plans
tawabinisáy
tell
me
said
he
he
don
been
to
kawágama
seven
year
he
go
blaze
trail
nex
day
we
go
how
would
it
be
if
one
or
two
of
us
went
with
him
to
see
how
he
does
it
asked
jim
buckshot
looked
at
us
strangely
do
want
to
follow
him
he
replied
with
a
significant
simplicity
he
run
like
a
deer
buckshot
said
i
pursuing
the
inevitable
linguistics
what
does
kawágama
mean
buckshot
thought
for
quite
two
minutes
then
he
drew
a
semicircle
you
call
dat
he
asked
crescent
like
moon
horseshoe
bow
we
proposed
buckshot
shook
his
head
at
each
suggestion
he
made
a
wriggling
mark
then
a
wide
sweep
then
a
loop
all
dose
said
he
you
call
him
curve
we
cried
áh
hah
assented
buckshot
satisfied
buckshot
we
went
on
what
does
tawabinisáy
mean
he
replied
promptly
the
following
morning
tawabinisáy
departed
carrying
a
lunch
and
a
at
four
he
was
back
sitting
on
a
log
and
smoking
a
pipe
in
the
meantime
we
had
made
up
our
party
tawabinisáy
himself
had
decided
that
the
two
must
stay
at
home
he
wished
to
share
his
secret
only
with
his
own
tribesmen
the
fiat
grieved
billy
for
behold
he
had
already
put
in
much
time
on
this
very
search
and
naturally
desired
to
be
in
at
the
finish
dick
too
wanted
to
go
but
him
we
decided
too
young
and
light
for
a
fast
march
dinnis
had
to
leave
the
river
in
a
day
or
so
johnnie
was
a
little
doubtful
as
to
the
tramp
although
he
concealed
his
doubt
at
least
to
his
own
satisfaction
under
a
variety
of
excuses
jim
and
doc
would
go
of
course
there
remained
doug
we
found
that
individual
erecting
a
rack
of
many
projecting
arms
like
a
greek
warrior
trophy
at
the
precise
spot
where
the
first
rays
of
the
morning
sun
would
strike
it
on
the
projecting
arms
he
purposed
hanging
his
wet
clothes
doug
said
we
do
you
want
to
go
to
kawágama
doug
turned
on
us
a
sardonic
eye
he
made
no
direct
answer
but
told
the
following
story
once
upon
a
time
judge
carter
was
riding
through
a
rural
district
in
virginia
he
stopped
at
a
negro
cabin
to
get
his
direction
said
he
you
direct
me
to
colonel
thompson
sah
replied
the
negro
goes
down
this
yah
road
two
mile
till
yo
comes
to
an
ol
ailm
tree
and
then
yo
to
th
right
down
a
lane
fo
a
of
a
mile
thah
you
sees
a
big
white
house
yo
wants
to
go
through
th
ya
to
a
paf
that
takes
you
a
spell
to
a
gate
yo
follows
that
road
to
th
lef
till
yo
comes
to
three
roads
goin
up
a
hill
and
jedge
don
mattah
which
one
of
them
thah
roads
yo
take
yo
gets
lost
surer
hell
anyway
then
doug
turned
placidly
back
to
the
construction
of
his
trophy
we
interpreted
this
as
an
answer
and
made
up
an
outfit
for
five
the
following
morning
at
six
we
were
under
way
johnnie
challán
ferried
us
across
the
river
in
two
instalments
we
waved
our
hands
and
plunged
through
the
brush
screen
thenceforth
it
was
walk
half
an
hour
rest
five
minutes
with
almost
the
regularity
of
clockwork
we
timed
the
indians
secretly
and
found
they
varied
by
hardly
a
minute
from
absolute
fidelity
to
this
schedule
we
had
at
first
of
course
to
gain
the
higher
level
of
the
hills
but
tawabinisáy
had
the
day
before
picked
out
a
route
that
mounted
as
easily
as
the
country
would
allow
and
through
a
hardwood
forest
free
of
underbrush
briefly
indicated
our
way
led
first
through
the
big
trees
and
up
the
hills
then
behind
a
great
cliff
knob
into
a
creek
valley
through
a
of
thicket
then
by
an
open
strip
to
the
first
little
lake
this
we
ferried
by
means
of
the
bark
canoe
carried
on
the
shoulders
of
tawabinisáy
in
the
course
of
the
morning
we
thus
passed
four
lakes
throughout
the
entire
distance
to
kawágama
were
the
fresh
the
indian
had
made
the
day
before
these
were
neither
so
frequent
nor
as
plainly
cut
as
a
white
man
trail
but
each
represented
a
pause
long
enough
for
the
clip
of
an
axe
in
addition
the
trail
had
been
made
passable
for
a
canoe
that
meant
the
cutting
out
of
overhanging
branches
wherever
they
might
catch
the
bow
of
the
craft
in
the
thicket
a
little
road
had
been
cleared
and
the
brush
had
been
piled
on
either
side
to
an
unaccustomed
eye
it
seemed
the
work
of
two
days
at
least
yet
tawabinisáy
had
picked
out
his
route
cleared
and
marked
it
thus
skirted
the
shores
of
the
lakes
we
were
able
to
traverse
in
the
canoe
and
had
returned
to
the
river
in
less
time
than
we
consumed
in
merely
reaching
the
lake
itself
truly
as
buckshot
said
he
must
have
run
like
a
deer
tawabinisáy
has
a
delightful
grin
which
he
displays
when
pleased
or
or
puzzled
or
interested
or
comprehending
just
as
a
dog
sneezes
and
wrinkles
up
his
nose
in
like
case
he
is
essentially
if
he
likes
you
and
approves
of
you
he
tries
to
teach
you
to
help
you
to
show
you
things
but
he
never
offers
to
do
any
part
of
your
work
and
on
the
march
he
never
looks
back
to
see
if
you
are
keeping
up
you
can
shout
at
him
until
you
are
black
in
the
face
but
never
will
he
pause
until
then
he
squats
on
his
heels
lights
his
pipe
and
grins
buckshot
adored
him
this
opportunity
of
travelling
with
him
was
an
epoch
he
drank
in
eagerly
the
brief
remarks
of
his
old
man
and
detailed
them
to
us
with
solemnity
prefaced
always
by
his
tawabinisáy
tell
me
buckshot
is
of
the
better
class
of
indian
himself
but
occasionally
he
is
puzzled
by
the
tawabinisáy
never
as
we
cooked
lunch
we
heard
the
sound
of
steady
footsteps
in
the
forest
then
a
pause
then
just
like
a
deer
browsing
to
make
sure
i
inquired
of
buckshot
what
is
it
buckshot
listened
a
moment
deer
said
he
decisively
then
not
because
he
doubted
his
own
judgment
but
from
habitual
deference
he
turned
to
where
tawabinisáy
was
frying
things
qwaw
he
inquired
tawabinisáy
never
even
looked
up
squirrel
said
he
we
looked
at
each
other
incredulously
it
sounded
like
a
deer
it
did
not
sound
in
the
least
like
a
squirrel
an
experienced
indian
had
pronounced
it
a
deer
nevertheless
it
was
a
squirrel
we
approached
kawágama
by
way
of
a
gradual
slope
clothed
with
a
beautiful
beech
and
maple
forest
whose
trees
were
the
tallest
of
those
species
i
have
ever
seen
ten
minutes
brought
us
to
the
shore
there
was
no
abrupt
bursting
in
on
kawágama
through
screens
of
leaves
we
entered
leisurely
to
her
presence
by
way
of
an
whose
spaciousness
permitted
no
vulgar
surprises
after
a
time
we
launched
our
canoe
from
a
natural
dock
afforded
by
a
cedar
root
and
so
stood
ready
to
cross
to
our
permanent
camp
but
first
we
drew
our
knives
and
erased
from
a
giant
birch
the
name
of
the
banker
clement
there
seems
to
me
little
use
in
telling
you
that
kawágama
is
about
four
miles
long
by
a
mile
wide
is
shaped
like
a
crescent
and
lies
in
a
valley
surrounded
by
high
hills
nor
that
its
water
is
so
transparent
that
the
bottom
is
visible
until
it
fades
into
the
sheer
blackness
of
depth
nor
that
it
is
alive
with
trout
nor
that
its
silence
is
the
silence
of
a
vast
solitude
so
that
always
even
at
daybreak
or
at
high
midday
it
seems
to
be
late
afternoon
that
would
convey
little
to
you
i
will
inform
you
quite
simply
that
kawágama
is
a
very
beautiful
specimen
of
the
wilderness
lake
that
it
is
as
the
lord
made
it
and
that
we
had
a
good
time
did
you
ever
fish
with
the
fly
from
a
canoe
on
absolutely
still
water
you
do
not
seem
to
move
but
far
below
you
gliding
silent
ghostlike
the
bottom
slips
beneath
like
a
in
an
imperceptible
current
of
air
your
bow
turns
to
right
or
left
in
apparent
obedience
to
the
mere
will
of
your
companion
and
the
flies
drop
softly
like
down
then
the
silence
becomes
sacred
you
whisper
although
there
is
no
reason
for
your
whispering
you
move
cautiously
lest
your
reel
scrape
the
gunwale
an
inadvertent
click
of
the
paddle
is
a
profanation
the
only
creatures
in
all
god
world
possessing
the
right
to
utter
aloud
a
single
syllable
are
the
loon
far
away
and
the
winter
wren
near
at
hand
even
the
trout
fight
grimly
without
noise
their
white
bodies
flashing
far
down
in
the
dimness
hour
after
hour
we
stole
here
and
there
like
conspirators
where
showed
the
circles
of
a
fish
rise
thither
crept
we
to
drop
a
fly
on
their
centre
as
in
the
of
a
target
the
trout
seemed
to
linger
near
their
latest
capture
so
often
we
would
catch
one
exactly
where
we
had
seen
him
break
water
some
little
time
before
in
this
was
the
charm
of
the
still
hunt
shoal
water
deep
water
it
seemed
all
the
same
to
our
fortunes
the
lake
was
full
of
fish
and
beautiful
fish
they
were
with
deep
glowing
bronze
bellies
and
all
of
from
a
pound
to
a
pound
and
a
half
in
weight
the
lake
had
not
been
fished
probably
somewhere
in
those
black
depths
over
one
of
the
bubbling
that
must
feed
so
cold
and
clear
a
body
of
water
are
big
fellows
lying
and
probably
the
crafty
minnow
or
spoon
might
lure
them
out
but
we
were
satisfied
with
our
game
at
other
times
we
paddled
here
and
there
in
exploration
of
coves
inlets
and
a
tiny
little
brook
that
flowed
westward
from
a
reed
marsh
to
join
another
river
running
parallel
to
our
own
the
indians
had
erected
a
huge
of
birch
bark
from
the
ribs
of
which
hung
clothes
and
the
little
bags
of
food
the
was
made
in
front
of
it
between
two
giant
birch
trees
at
evening
the
light
and
heat
reflected
strongly
beneath
the
shelter
leaving
the
forest
in
impenetrable
darkness
to
the
very
edge
of
mystery
crowded
the
strange
woods
noises
the
eerie
influences
of
the
night
like
wolves
afraid
of
the
blaze
we
felt
them
hovering
vague
huge
dreadful
just
outside
the
circle
of
safety
our
fire
had
traced
about
us
the
cheerful
flames
were
dancing
familiars
who
cherished
for
us
the
home
feeling
in
the
middle
of
a
wilderness
two
days
we
lingered
then
took
the
back
track
a
little
after
noon
we
arrived
at
the
camp
empty
save
for
johnnie
challán
towards
dark
the
fishermen
straggled
in
time
had
been
paid
them
in
familiar
coinage
they
had
demanded
only
accustomed
toll
of
the
days
but
we
had
returned
laden
with
strange
and
glittering
memories
xix
apologia
the
time
at
last
arrived
for
departure
deep
laden
were
the
canoes
heavy
laden
were
we
the
indians
shot
away
down
the
current
we
followed
for
the
last
time
the
dim
blazed
trail
forded
for
the
last
time
the
shallows
of
the
river
at
the
burned
rock
pool
we
caught
our
lunch
fish
from
the
ranks
of
leviathans
then
the
trodden
way
of
the
fur
trail
worn
into
a
groove
so
deep
and
a
surface
so
smooth
that
vegetation
has
left
it
as
bare
as
ever
though
the
post
has
been
abandoned
these
many
years
at
last
the
scrub
spruce
and
the
sandy
soil
and
the
blue
restless
waters
of
the
great
lake
with
the
appearance
of
the
early
the
following
day
the
summer
ended
how
often
have
i
ruminated
in
the
long
marches
the
problem
of
the
forest
subtle
she
is
and
mysterious
and
gifted
with
a
charm
that
lures
vast
she
is
and
dreadful
so
that
man
bows
before
her
fiercer
moods
a
little
thing
gentle
she
is
and
kindly
so
that
she
denies
nothing
whether
of
the
material
or
spiritual
to
those
of
her
chosen
who
will
seek
august
she
is
and
yet
of
a
homely
sprightly
gentleness
variable
she
is
in
her
many
moods
night
day
sun
cloud
rain
snow
wind
lend
to
her
their
best
of
warmth
and
cold
of
comfort
and
awe
of
peace
and
of
many
shoutings
and
she
accepts
them
but
yet
remains
greater
and
more
enduring
than
they
in
her
is
all
the
sweetness
of
little
things
murmurs
of
water
and
of
breeze
faint
odours
wandering
streams
of
tepid
air
stray
in
fragment
as
when
a
door
is
opened
and
closed
the
softness
of
moss
the
coolness
of
shade
the
glimpse
of
occult
affairs
in
the
woods
life
accompany
her
as
titania
her
court
how
to
express
these
things
how
to
fix
on
paper
in
a
record
as
one
would
describe
the
capitol
at
washington
what
the
forest
is
that
is
what
i
have
asked
myself
often
and
that
is
what
i
have
never
yet
found
out
this
is
the
wisdom
reflection
has
taught
one
can
not
imprison
the
ocean
in
a
vial
of
one
can
not
imprison
the
forest
inside
the
covers
of
a
book
there
remains
the
second
best
i
have
thought
that
perhaps
if
i
were
to
attempt
a
series
of
detached
impressions
without
relation
without
sequence
if
i
were
to
suggest
a
little
here
the
beauty
of
a
there
the
humour
of
a
rainstorm
at
the
last
you
might
by
dint
of
imagination
and
sympathy
get
some
slight
feeling
of
what
the
great
woods
are
it
is
the
method
of
the
painter
perhaps
it
may
suffice
for
this
reason
let
no
old
camper
look
upon
this
volume
as
a
treatise
on
woodcraft
woodcraft
there
is
in
it
just
as
there
is
woodcraft
in
the
forest
itself
but
much
of
the
simplest
and
most
obvious
does
not
appear
the
painter
would
not
depict
every
twig
as
would
the
naturalist
equally
it
can
not
be
considered
a
book
of
travel
nor
of
description
the
story
is
not
consecutive
the
adventures
not
exciting
the
landscape
not
denned
perhaps
it
may
be
permitted
to
call
it
a
book
of
suggestion
often
on
the
street
we
have
had
opened
to
us
by
the
merest
sketches
of
incident
limitless
vistas
of
memory
a
momentary
pose
of
the
head
of
a
a
chance
word
the
breath
of
a
faint
perfume
these
bring
back
to
us
the
entirety
of
forgotten
scenes
some
of
these
essays
may
perform
a
like
office
for
you
i
can
not
hope
to
give
you
the
forest
but
perhaps
a
word
or
a
sentence
an
incident
an
impression
may
quicken
your
imagination
so
that
through
no
conscious
direction
of
my
own
the
wonder
of
the
forest
may
fill
you
as
the
mere
sight
of
a
will
sometimes
till

the
wonder
of
