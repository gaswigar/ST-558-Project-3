once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
little
fat
comfortable
grey
squirrel
called
timmy
tiptoes
he
had
a
nest
thatched
with
leaves
in
the
top
of
a
tall
tree
and
he
had
a
little
squirrel
wife
called
goody
illustration
timmy
tiptoes
sat
out
enjoying
the
breeze
he
whisked
his
tail
and
chuckled
little
wife
goody
the
nuts
are
ripe
we
must
lay
up
a
store
for
winter
and
spring
goody
tiptoes
was
busy
pushing
moss
under
the
thatch
the
nest
is
so
snug
we
shall
be
sound
asleep
all
winter
then
we
shall
wake
up
all
the
thinner
when
there
is
nothing
to
eat
in
replied
prudent
timothy
illustration
when
timmy
and
goody
tiptoes
came
to
the
nut
thicket
they
found
other
squirrels
were
there
already
timmy
took
off
his
jacket
and
hung
it
on
a
twig
they
worked
away
quietly
by
themselves
illustration
every
day
they
made
several
journeys
and
picked
quantities
of
nuts
they
carried
them
away
in
bags
and
stored
them
in
several
hollow
stumps
near
the
tree
where
they
had
built
their
nest
illustration
when
these
stumps
were
full
they
began
to
empty
the
bags
into
a
hole
high
up
a
tree
that
had
belonged
to
a
the
nuts
rattled
down
down
down
inside
how
shall
you
ever
get
them
out
again
it
is
like
a
said
goody
i
shall
be
much
thinner
before
my
love
said
timmy
tiptoes
peeping
into
the
hole
illustration
they
did
collect
quantities
because
they
did
not
lose
them
squirrels
who
bury
their
nuts
in
the
ground
lose
more
than
half
because
they
can
not
remember
the
place
the
most
forgetful
squirrel
in
the
wood
was
called
silvertail
he
began
to
dig
and
he
could
not
remember
and
then
he
dug
again
and
found
some
nuts
that
did
not
belong
to
him
and
there
was
a
fight
and
other
squirrels
began
to
dig
the
whole
wood
was
in
commotion
illustration
unfortunately
just
at
this
time
a
flock
of
little
birds
flew
by
from
bush
to
bush
searching
for
green
caterpillars
and
spiders
there
were
several
sorts
of
little
birds
twittering
different
songs
the
first
one
sang
who
bin
nuts
nuts
and
another
sang
little
bita
bread
little
illustration
the
squirrels
followed
and
listened
the
first
little
bird
flew
into
the
bush
where
timmy
and
goody
tiptoes
were
quietly
tying
up
their
bags
and
it
sang
nuts
who
been
timmy
tiptoes
went
on
with
his
work
without
replying
indeed
the
little
bird
did
not
expect
an
answer
it
was
only
singing
its
natural
song
and
it
meant
nothing
at
all
illustration
but
when
the
other
squirrels
heard
that
song
they
rushed
upon
timmy
tiptoes
and
cuffed
and
scratched
him
and
upset
his
bag
of
nuts
the
innocent
little
bird
which
had
caused
all
the
mischief
flew
away
in
a
fright
timmy
rolled
over
and
over
and
then
turned
tail
and
fled
towards
his
nest
followed
by
a
crowd
of
squirrels
shouting
illustration
they
caught
him
and
dragged
him
up
the
very
same
tree
where
there
was
the
little
round
hole
and
they
pushed
him
in
the
hole
was
much
too
small
for
timmy
tiptoes
figure
they
squeezed
him
dreadfully
it
was
a
wonder
they
did
not
break
his
ribs
we
will
leave
him
here
till
he
confesses
said
silvertail
squirrel
and
he
shouted
into
the
hole
illustration
timmy
tiptoes
made
no
reply
he
had
tumbled
down
inside
the
tree
upon
half
a
peck
of
nuts
belonging
to
himself
he
lay
quite
stunned
and
still
illustration
goody
tiptoes
picked
up
the
nut
bags
and
went
home
she
made
a
cup
of
tea
for
timmy
but
he
did
come
and
did
come
goody
tiptoes
passed
a
lonely
and
unhappy
night
next
morning
she
ventured
back
to
the
to
look
for
him
but
the
other
unkind
squirrels
drove
her
away
she
wandered
all
over
the
wood
calling
timmy
tiptoes
timmy
tiptoes
oh
where
is
timmy
tiptoes
illustration
in
the
meantime
timmy
tiptoes
came
to
his
senses
he
found
himself
tucked
up
in
a
little
moss
bed
very
much
in
the
dark
feeling
sore
it
seemed
to
be
under
ground
timmy
coughed
and
groaned
because
his
ribs
hurted
him
there
was
a
chirpy
noise
and
a
small
striped
chipmunk
appeared
with
a
night
light
and
hoped
he
felt
better
it
was
most
kind
to
timmy
tiptoes
it
lent
him
its
and
the
house
was
full
of
provisions
illustration
the
chipmunk
explained
that
it
had
rained
nuts
through
the
top
of
the
tree
besides
i
found
a
few
buried
it
laughed
and
chuckled
when
it
heard
timmy
story
while
timmy
was
confined
to
bed
it
him
to
eat
quantities
but
how
shall
i
ever
get
out
through
that
hole
unless
i
thin
myself
my
wife
will
be
anxious
just
another
nut
or
two
nuts
let
me
crack
them
for
you
said
the
chipmunk
timmy
tiptoes
grew
fatter
and
fatter
illustration
now
goody
tiptoes
had
set
to
work
again
by
herself
she
did
not
put
any
more
nuts
into
the
woodpecker
hole
because
she
had
always
doubted
how
they
could
be
got
out
again
she
hid
them
under
a
tree
root
they
rattled
down
down
down
once
when
goody
emptied
an
extra
big
bagful
there
was
a
decided
squeak
and
next
time
goody
brought
another
bagful
a
little
striped
chipmunk
scrambled
out
in
a
hurry
illustration
it
is
getting
perfectly
the
is
full
and
they
are
rolling
along
the
passage
and
my
husband
chippy
hackee
has
run
away
and
left
me
what
is
the
explanation
of
these
showers
of
nuts
i
am
sure
i
beg
your
pardon
i
did
not
know
that
anybody
lived
here
said
goody
tiptoes
but
where
is
chippy
hackee
my
husband
timmy
tiptoes
has
run
away
too
i
know
where
chippy
is
a
little
bird
told
me
said
chippy
hackee
illustration
she
led
the
way
to
the
woodpecker
tree
and
they
listened
at
the
hole
down
below
there
was
a
noise
of
nut
crackers
and
a
fat
squirrel
voice
and
a
thin
squirrel
voice
were
singing
together
my
little
old
man
and
i
fell
out
how
shall
we
bring
this
matter
about
bring
it
about
as
well
as
you
can
and
get
you
gone
you
little
old
man
illustration
you
could
squeeze
in
through
that
little
round
hole
said
goody
tiptoes
yes
i
could
said
the
chipmunk
but
my
husband
chippy
hackee
bites
down
below
there
was
a
noise
of
cracking
nuts
and
nibbling
and
then
the
fat
squirrel
voice
and
the
thin
squirrel
voice
sang
for
the
diddlum
day
day
diddle
dum
di
day
diddle
diddle
dum
day
illustration
then
goody
peeped
in
at
the
hole
and
called
down
timmy
tiptoes
oh
fie
timmy
tiptoes
and
timmy
replied
is
that
you
goody
tiptoes
why
certainly
he
came
up
and
kissed
goody
through
the
hole
but
he
was
so
fat
that
he
could
not
get
out
chippy
hackee
was
not
too
fat
but
he
did
not
want
to
come
he
stayed
down
below
and
chuckled
illustration
and
so
it
went
on
for
a
fortnight
till
a
big
wind
blew
off
the
top
of
the
tree
and
opened
up
the
hole
and
let
in
the
rain
then
timmy
tiptoes
came
out
and
went
home
with
an
umbrella
illustration
but
chippy
hackee
continued
to
camp
out
for
another
week
although
it
was
uncomfortable
illustration
at
last
a
large
bear
came
walking
through
the
wood
perhaps
he
also
was
looking
for
nuts
he
seemed
to
be
sniffing
around
illustration
chippy
hackee
went
home
in
a
hurry
illustration
and
when
chippy
hackee
got
home
he
found
he
had
caught
a
cold
in
his
head
and
he
was
more
uncomfortable
still
illustration
and
now
timmy
and
goody
tiptoes
keep
their
fastened
up
with
a
little
padlock
illustration
and
whenever
that
little
bird
sees
the
chipmunks
he
sings
who
been
but
nobody
ever
answers
the
end
