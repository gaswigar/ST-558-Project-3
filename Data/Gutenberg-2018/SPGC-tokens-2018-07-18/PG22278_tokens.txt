introduction
it
so
happened
that
the
circumstances
of
fate
allowed
me
to
follow
my
own
bent
in
the
choice
of
a
profession
from
my
earliest
youth
the
weird
the
mysterious
had
an
irresistible
fascination
for
me
having
private
means
i
resolved
to
follow
my
unique
inclinations
and
i
am
now
well
known
to
all
my
friends
as
a
professional
exposer
of
ghosts
and
one
who
can
clear
away
the
mysteries
of
most
haunted
houses
up
to
the
present
i
have
never
had
cause
to
regret
my
choice
but
at
the
same
time
i
can
not
too
strongly
advise
any
one
who
thinks
of
following
my
example
to
hesitate
before
engaging
himself
in
tasks
that
entail
time
expense
thankless
labour
often
ridicule
and
not
seldom
great
personal
danger
to
explain
by
the
application
of
science
phenomena
attributed
to
spiritual
agencies
has
been
the
work
of
my
life
i
have
naturally
gone
through
strange
difficulties
in
accomplishing
my
mission
i
propose
in
these
pages
to
relate
the
histories
of
certain
queer
events
enveloped
at
first
in
mystery
and
apparently
dark
with
portent
but
nevertheless
when
grappled
with
in
the
true
spirit
of
science
capable
of
explanation
i
the
mystery
of
the
circular
chamber
one
day
in
late
september
i
received
the
following
letter
from
my
lawyer
my
dear
bell
i
shall
esteem
it
a
favour
if
you
can
make
it
convenient
to
call
upon
me
at
ten
morning
on
a
matter
of
extreme
privacy
at
the
appointed
hour
i
was
shown
into
edgcombe
private
room
i
had
known
him
for
years
we
were
in
fact
old
friends
and
i
was
startled
now
by
the
look
of
worry
not
to
say
anxiety
on
his
usually
serene
features
you
are
the
very
man
i
want
bell
he
cried
sit
down
i
have
a
great
deal
to
say
to
you
there
is
a
mystery
of
a
very
grave
nature
which
i
hope
you
may
solve
for
me
it
is
in
connection
with
a
house
said
to
be
haunted
he
fixed
his
bright
eyes
on
my
face
as
he
spoke
i
sat
perfectly
silent
waiting
for
him
to
continue
in
the
first
place
he
resumed
i
must
ask
you
to
regard
the
matter
as
confidential
certainly
i
answered
you
know
he
went
on
that
i
have
often
laughed
at
your
special
hobby
but
it
occurred
to
me
yesterday
that
the
experiences
you
have
lived
through
may
enable
you
to
give
me
valuable
assistance
in
this
difficulty
i
will
do
my
best
for
you
edgcombe
i
replied
he
lay
back
in
his
chair
folding
his
hands
the
case
is
briefly
as
follows
he
began
it
is
connected
with
the
family
of
the
wentworths
the
only
son
archibald
the
artist
has
just
died
under
most
extraordinary
circumstances
he
was
as
you
probably
know
one
of
the
most
promising
painters
of
the
younger
school
and
his
pictures
in
this
year
academy
met
with
universal
praise
he
was
the
heir
to
the
wentworth
estates
and
his
death
has
caused
a
complication
of
claims
from
a
member
of
a
collateral
branch
of
the
family
who
when
the
present
squire
dies
is
entitled
to
the
money
this
man
has
spent
the
greater
part
of
his
life
in
australia
is
badly
off
and
evidently
belongs
to
a
rowdy
set
he
has
been
to
see
me
two
or
three
times
and
i
must
say
frankly
that
i
am
not
taken
with
his
appearance
had
he
anything
to
do
with
the
death
i
interrupted
nothing
whatever
as
you
will
quickly
perceive
wentworth
has
been
accustomed
from
time
to
time
to
go
alone
on
sketching
tours
to
different
parts
of
the
country
he
has
tramped
about
on
foot
and
visited
odd
nooks
searching
for
subjects
he
never
took
much
money
with
him
and
always
travelled
as
an
apparently
poor
man
a
month
ago
he
started
off
alone
on
one
of
these
tours
he
had
a
handsome
commission
from
barlow
in
the
strand
he
was
to
paint
certain
parts
of
the
river
merran
and
although
he
certainly
did
not
need
money
he
seemed
glad
of
an
object
for
a
good
ramble
he
parted
with
his
family
in
the
best
of
health
and
spirits
and
wrote
to
them
from
time
to
time
but
a
week
ago
they
heard
the
news
that
he
had
died
suddenly
at
an
inn
on
the
merran
there
was
of
course
an
inquest
and
an
autopsy
dr
miles
gordon
the
wentworths
consulting
physician
was
telegraphed
for
and
was
present
at
the
examination
he
is
absolutely
puzzled
to
account
for
the
death
the
medical
examination
showed
wentworth
to
be
in
apparently
perfect
health
at
the
time
there
was
no
lesion
to
be
discovered
upon
which
to
base
a
different
opinion
all
the
organs
being
healthy
neither
was
there
any
trace
of
poison
nor
marks
of
violence
the
coroner
verdict
was
that
wentworth
died
of
syncope
which
as
you
know
perhaps
is
a
synonym
for
an
unknown
cause
the
inn
where
he
died
is
a
very
lonely
one
and
has
the
reputation
of
being
haunted
the
landlord
seems
to
bear
a
bad
character
although
nothing
has
ever
been
proved
against
him
but
a
young
girl
who
lives
at
the
inn
gave
evidence
which
at
first
startled
every
one
she
said
at
the
inquest
that
she
had
earnestly
warned
wentworth
not
to
sleep
in
the
haunted
room
she
had
scarcely
told
the
coroner
so
before
she
fell
to
the
floor
in
an
epileptic
fit
when
she
came
to
herself
she
was
sullen
and
silent
and
nothing
more
could
be
extracted
from
her
the
old
man
the
innkeeper
explained
that
the
girl
was
but
he
did
not
attempt
to
deny
that
the
house
had
the
reputation
of
being
haunted
and
said
that
he
had
himself
begged
wentworth
not
to
put
up
there
well
that
is
about
the
whole
of
the
story
the
coroner
inquest
seems
to
deny
the
evidence
of
foul
play
but
i
have
my
very
strong
suspicions
what
i
want
you
to
do
is
to
ascertain
if
they
are
correct
will
you
undertake
the
case
i
will
certainly
do
so
i
replied
please
let
me
have
any
further
particulars
and
a
written
document
to
show
in
case
of
need
that
i
am
acting
under
your
directions
edgcombe
agreed
to
this
and
i
soon
afterwards
took
my
leave
the
case
had
the
features
of
an
interesting
problem
and
i
hoped
that
i
should
prove
successful
in
solving
it
that
evening
i
made
my
plans
carefully
i
would
go
into
shire
early
on
the
following
morning
assuming
for
my
purpose
the
character
of
an
amateur
photographer
having
got
all
necessary
particulars
from
edgcombe
i
made
a
careful
mental
map
of
my
operations
first
of
all
i
would
visit
a
little
village
of
the
name
of
harkhurst
and
put
up
at
the
inn
the
crown
and
thistle
here
wentworth
had
spent
a
fortnight
when
he
first
started
on
his
commission
to
make
drawings
of
the
river
merran
i
thought
it
likely
that
i
should
obtain
some
information
there
circumstances
must
guide
me
as
to
my
further
steps
but
my
intention
was
to
proceed
from
harkhurst
to
the
castle
inn
which
was
situated
about
six
miles
further
up
the
river
this
was
the
inn
where
the
tragedy
had
occurred
towards
evening
on
the
following
day
i
arrived
at
harkhurst
when
my
carriage
drew
up
at
the
crown
and
thistle
the
landlady
was
standing
in
the
doorway
she
was
a
dame
with
a
kindly
face
i
asked
for
a
bed
certainly
sir
she
answered
she
turned
with
me
into
the
little
inn
and
taking
me
upstairs
showed
me
a
small
room
quite
clean
and
comfortable
looking
out
on
the
yard
i
said
it
would
do
capitally
and
she
hurried
downstairs
to
prepare
my
supper
after
this
meal
which
proved
to
be
excellent
i
determined
to
visit
the
landlord
in
the
bar
i
found
him
chatty
and
communicative
this
is
a
lonely
place
he
said
we
do
often
have
a
soul
staying
with
us
for
a
month
at
a
time
as
he
spoke
he
walked
to
the
door
and
i
followed
him
the
shades
of
night
were
beginning
to
fall
but
the
picturesqueness
of
the
little
hamlet
could
not
but
commend
itself
to
me
and
yet
it
is
a
lovely
spot
i
said
i
should
have
thought
tourists
would
have
thronged
to
it
it
is
at
least
an
ideal
place
for
photographers
you
are
right
there
sir
replied
the
man
and
although
we
often
have
company
to
stay
in
the
inn
now
and
then
we
have
a
stray
artist
it
not
three
weeks
back
he
continued
that
we
had
a
gentleman
like
you
sir
only
a
bit
younger
to
stay
with
us
for
a
week
or
two
he
was
an
artist
and
drew
from
morning
till
night
ah
poor
fellow
why
do
you
say
that
i
asked
i
have
good
cause
sir
here
wife
continued
the
landlord
looking
over
his
shoulder
at
johnson
the
landlady
who
now
appeared
on
the
scene
this
gentleman
has
been
asking
me
questions
about
our
visitor
wentworth
but
perhaps
we
ought
not
to
inflict
such
a
dismal
story
upon
him
pray
do
i
said
what
you
have
already
hinted
at
arouses
my
curiosity
why
should
you
pity
mr
wentworth
he
is
dead
sir
said
the
landlady
in
a
solemn
voice
i
gave
a
pretended
start
and
she
continued
and
it
was
all
his
own
fault
ah
dear
it
makes
me
almost
cry
to
think
of
it
he
was
as
nice
a
gentleman
as
i
ever
set
eyes
on
and
so
strong
hearty
and
pleasant
well
sir
everything
went
well
until
one
day
he
said
to
me
am
about
to
leave
you
johnson
i
am
going
to
a
little
place
called
the
castle
inn
further
up
the
merran
castle
inn
i
cried
wentworth
that
you
wo
not
if
you
value
your
life
why
not
he
said
looking
at
me
with
as
merry
blue
eyes
as
you
ever
saw
in
anybody
head
should
i
not
visit
the
castle
inn
i
have
a
commission
to
make
some
drawings
of
that
special
bend
of
the
river
then
sir
i
answered
that
is
the
case
you
just
have
a
horse
and
trap
from
here
and
drive
over
as
often
as
you
want
to
for
the
castle
inn
ai
a
fit
place
for
a
christian
to
put
up
at
do
you
mean
he
asked
of
me
is
said
to
be
haunted
sir
and
what
does
happen
in
that
house
the
lord
only
knows
but
there
not
been
a
visitor
at
the
inn
for
some
years
not
since
bailiff
holt
came
by
his
death
by
his
death
he
asked
how
was
that
knows
but
i
do
i
answered
the
coroner
inquest
it
was
said
that
he
died
from
syncope
whatever
that
means
but
the
folks
round
here
said
it
was
fright
wentworth
just
laughed
at
me
he
mind
a
word
i
said
and
the
next
day
sir
he
was
off
carrying
his
belongings
with
him
well
and
what
happened
i
asked
seeing
that
she
paused
what
happened
sir
just
what
i
expected
two
days
afterwards
came
the
news
of
his
death
poor
young
gentleman
he
died
in
the
very
room
where
holt
had
breathed
his
last
and
oh
if
there
was
a
fuss
and
for
it
turned
out
that
although
he
seemed
quite
poor
to
us
with
little
or
no
money
he
was
no
end
of
a
swell
and
had
rich
relations
and
big
estates
coming
to
him
and
of
course
there
was
a
coroner
inquest
and
all
the
rest
and
great
doctors
came
down
from
london
and
our
stanmore
who
lives
down
the
street
was
sent
for
and
though
they
did
all
they
could
and
examined
him
as
it
were
with
a
microscope
they
could
find
no
cause
for
death
and
so
they
give
it
out
that
it
was
syncope
just
as
they
did
in
the
case
of
poor
holt
but
sir
it
was
it
was
fright
sheer
fright
the
place
is
haunted
it
a
mysterious
dreadful
house
and
i
only
hope
you
wo
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
she
added
a
few
more
words
and
presently
left
us
that
a
strange
story
i
said
turning
to
johnson
your
wife
has
excited
my
curiosity
i
should
much
like
to
get
further
particulars
there
do
seem
to
be
anything
more
to
tell
sir
replied
johnson
it
true
what
the
wife
says
that
the
castle
inn
has
a
bad
name
not
the
first
no
nor
the
second
death
that
has
occurred
there
you
mentioned
your
village
doctor
do
you
think
he
could
enlighten
me
on
the
subject
i
am
sure
he
would
do
his
best
sir
he
lives
only
six
doors
away
in
a
red
house
maybe
you
would
mind
stepping
down
the
street
and
speaking
to
him
you
are
sure
he
would
not
think
it
a
liberty
not
he
sir
he
be
only
too
pleased
to
exchange
a
word
with
some
one
outside
this
sleepy
little
place
then
i
call
on
him
i
answered
and
taking
up
my
hat
i
strolled
down
the
street
i
was
lucky
in
finding
stanmore
at
home
and
the
moment
i
saw
his
face
i
determined
to
take
him
into
my
confidence
the
fact
is
this
i
said
when
he
had
shaken
hands
with
me
i
should
not
dream
of
taking
this
liberty
did
i
not
feel
certain
that
you
could
help
me
and
in
what
way
he
asked
not
stiffly
but
with
a
keen
inquiring
interested
glance
i
have
been
sent
down
from
london
to
inquire
into
the
wentworth
mystery
i
said
is
that
so
he
said
with
a
start
then
he
continued
gravely
i
fear
you
have
come
on
a
chase
there
was
nothing
discovered
at
the
autopsy
to
account
for
the
death
there
were
no
marks
on
the
body
and
all
the
organs
were
healthy
i
met
wentworth
often
while
he
was
staying
here
and
he
was
as
hearty
and
a
young
man
as
i
have
ever
come
across
but
the
castle
inn
has
a
bad
reputation
i
said
that
is
true
the
people
here
are
afraid
of
it
it
is
said
to
be
haunted
but
really
sir
you
and
i
need
not
trouble
ourselves
about
stupid
reports
of
that
sort
old
bindloss
the
landlord
has
lived
there
for
years
and
there
has
never
been
anything
proved
against
him
is
he
alone
no
his
wife
and
a
grandchild
live
there
also
a
grandchild
i
said
did
not
this
girl
give
some
startling
evidence
at
the
inquest
nothing
of
any
consequence
replied
stanmore
she
only
repeated
what
bindloss
had
already
said
himself
that
the
house
was
haunted
and
that
she
had
asked
wentworth
not
to
sleep
in
the
room
has
anything
ever
been
done
to
explain
the
reason
why
this
room
is
said
to
be
haunted
i
continued
not
that
i
know
of
rats
are
probably
at
the
bottom
of
it
but
have
not
there
been
other
deaths
in
the
house
that
is
true
how
many
well
i
have
myself
attended
no
less
than
three
similar
inquests
and
what
was
the
verdict
of
the
jury
in
each
case
the
verdict
was
death
from
syncope
which
means
cause
unknown
i
said
jumping
impatiently
to
my
feet
i
wonder
stanmore
that
you
are
satisfied
to
leave
the
matter
in
such
a
state
and
pray
what
can
i
do
he
inquired
i
am
asked
to
examine
a
body
i
find
all
the
organs
in
perfect
health
i
can
not
trace
the
least
appearance
of
violence
nor
can
i
detect
poison
what
other
evidence
can
i
honestly
give
i
can
only
say
that
i
should
not
be
satisfied
i
replied
i
now
wish
to
add
that
i
have
come
down
from
london

days
i

up
no
end
of
a
row

stanmore
and
of
course

your
letter
soon
afterwards
i
shook
hands
with
the
doctor
and
left
him
after
an
early
dinner
on
the
following
day
i
parted
with
my
landlord
and
his
wife
and
with
my
knapsack
and
kodak
strapped
over
my
shoulders
started
on
my
way
i
took
care
to
tell
no
one
that
i
was
going
to
the
castle
inn
and
for
this
purpose
doubled
back
through
a
wood
and
so
found
the
right
road
the
sun
was
nearly
setting
when
at
last
i
approached
a
signpost
on
which
in
characters
i
could
read
the
words
to
the
castle
inn
i
found
myself
now
at
the
entrance
of
a
small
lane
which
was
evidently
little
frequented
as
it
was
considerably
from
where
i
stood
i
could
catch
no
sight
of
any
habitation
but
just
at
that
moment
a
low
somewhat
inconsequent
laugh
fell
upon
my
ears
i
turned
quickly
and
saw
a
pretty
girl
with
bright
eyes
and
a
childish
face
gazing
at
me
with
interest
i
had
little
doubt
that
she
was
old
bindloss
will
you
kindly
tell
me
i
asked
if
this
is
the
way
to
the
castle
inn
my
remark
evidently
startled
her
she
made
a
bound
forward
seized
me
by
my
hand
and
tried
to
push
me
away
from
the
entrance
to
the
lane
into
the
high
road
go
away
she
cried
we
have
no
beds
fit
for
gentlemen
at
the
castle
inn
go
go
she
continued
and
she
pointed
up
the
winding
road
her
eyes
were
now
blazing
in
her
head
but
i
noticed
that
her
lips
trembled
and
that
very
little
would
cause
her
to
burst
into
tears
but
i
am
tired
and
footsore
i
answered
i
should
like
to
put
up
at
the
inn
for
the
night
do
she
repeated
they
put
you
into
a
room
with
a
ghost
go
a
place
for
gentlemen
here
she
burst
not
into
tears
but
into
a
fit
of
high
shrill
almost
idiotic
laughter
she
suddenly
clapped
one
of
her
hands
to
her
forehead
and
turning
flew
almost
as
fast
as
the
wind
down
the
narrow
lane
and
out
of
sight
i
followed
her
quickly
i
did
not
believe
that
the
girl
was
quite
as
mad
as
she
seemed
but
i
had
little
doubt
that
she
had
something
extraordinary
weighing
on
her
mind
at
the
next
turn
i
came
in
view
of
the
inn
it
was
a
old
place
and
i
stopped
for
a
moment
to
look
at
it
the
house
was
entirely
built
of
stone
there
were
two
storeys
to
the
centre
part
which
was
square
and
at
the
four
corners
stood
four
round
towers
the
house
was
built
right
on
the
river
just
below
a
large
i
walked
up
to
the
door
and
pounded
on
it
with
my
stick
it
was
shut
and
looked
as
inhospitable
as
the
rest
of
the
place
after
a
moment
delay
it
was
opened
two
or
three
inches
and
the
surly
face
of
an
old
woman
peeped
out
and
what
may
you
be
wanting
she
asked
a
bed
for
the
night
i
replied
can
you
accommodate
me
she
glanced
suspiciously
first
at
me
and
then
at
my
camera
you
are
an
artist
i
make
no
doubt
she
said
and
we
do
want
no
more
of
them
here
she
was
about
to
slam
the
door
in
my
face
but
i
pushed
my
foot
between
it
and
the
lintel
i
am
easily
pleased
i
said
can
you
not
give
me
some
sort
of
bed
for
the
night
you
had
best
have
nothing
to
do
with
us
she
answered
you
go
off
to
harkhurst
they
can
put
you
up
at
the
crown
and
thistle
i
have
just
come
from
there
i
answered
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
could
not
walk
another
mile
we
do
want
visitors
at
the
castle
inn
she
continued
here
she
peered
forward
and
looked
into
my
face
you
had
best
be
off
she
repeated
they
say
the
place
is
haunted
i
uttered
a
laugh
you
do
expect
me
to
believe
that
i
said
she
glanced
at
me
from
head
to
foot
her
face
was
ominously
grave
you
had
best
know
all
sir
she
said
after
a
pause
something
happens
in
this
house
and
no
living
soul
knows
what
it
is
for
they
who
have
seen
it
have
never
yet
survived
to
tell
the
tale
it
not
more
than
a
week
back
that
a
young
gentleman
came
here
he
was
like
you
bold
as
brass
and
he
too
wanted
a
bed
and
would
take
no
denial
i
told
him
plain
and
so
did
my
man
that
the
place
was
haunted
he
did
mind
no
more
than
you
mind
well
he
slept
in
the
only
room
we
have
got
for
guests
and
he
he
what
did
he
die
of
i
asked
fright
was
the
answer
brief
and
laconic
now
do
you
want
to
come
or
not
yes
i
do
believe
in
ghosts
i
want
the
bed
and
i
am
determined
to
have
it
the
woman
flung
the
door
wide
open
do
say
as
i
ai
warned
you
she
cried
come
in
if
you
must
she
led
me
into
the
kitchen
where
a
fire
burned
sullenly
on
the
hearth
sit
you
down
and
i
send
for
bindloss
she
said
i
can
only
promise
to
give
you
a
bed
if
bindloss
agrees
liz
come
along
here
this
minute
a
quick
young
step
was
heard
in
the
passage
and
the
pretty
girl
whom
i
had
seen
at
the
top
of
the
lane
entered
her
eyes
sought
my
face
her
lips
moved
as
if
to
say
something
but
no
sound
issued
from
them
go
and
find
your
grandad
said
the
old
woman
tell
him
there
is
a
gentleman
here
that
wants
a
bed
ask
him
what
to
be
done
the
girl
favoured
me
with
a
long
and
peculiar
glance
then
turning
on
her
heel
she
left
the
room
as
soon
as
she
did
so
the
old
woman
peered
forward
and
looked
curiously
at
me
i
sorry
you
are
staying
she
said
do
forget
as
i
warned
you
remember
this
ai
a
proper
inn
at
all
once
it
was
a
mill
but
that
was
afore
bindloss
day
and
mine
gents
would
come
in
the
summer
and
put
up
for
the
fishing
but
then
the
story
of
the
ghost
got
abroad
and
lately
we
have
no
visitors
to
speak
of
only
an
odd
one
now
and
then
who
ai
wanted
no
he
ai
wanted
you
see
there
was
three
deaths
here
yes
she
held
up
one
of
her
skinny
hands
and
began
to
count
on
her
fingers
yes
three
up
to
the
present
three
that
it
ah
here
comes
bindloss
a
shuffling
step
was
heard
in
the
passage
and
an
old
man
bent
with
age
and
wearing
a
long
white
beard
entered
the
room
we
has
no
beds
for
strangers
he
said
speaking
in
an
aggressive
and
loud
tone
has
the
wife
said
so
we
do
let
out
beds
here
as
that
is
the
case
you
have
no
right
to
have
that
signpost
at
the
end
of
the
lane
i
retorted
i
am
not
in
a
mood
to
walk
eight
miles
for
a
shelter
in
a
country
i
know
nothing
about
can
not
you
put
me
up
somehow
i
have
told
the
gentleman
everything
sam
said
the
wife
he
is
just
for
all
the
world
like
young
wentworth
and
not
a
bit
frightened
the
old
landlord
came
up
and
faced
me
look
you
here
he
said
you
stay
on
at
your
peril
i
do
want
you
nor
do
the
wife
now
is
it
or
it
is
i
said
there
only
one
room
you
can
sleep
in
one
room
is
sufficient
it
the
one
wentworth
died
in
had
you
best
take
up
your
traps
and
be
off
no
i
shall
stay
then
there
no
more
to
be
said
run
liz
said
the
woman
and
light
the
fire
in
the
parlour
the
girl
left
the
room
and
the
woman
taking
up
a
candle
said
she
would
take
me
to
the
chamber
where
i
was
to
sleep
she
led
me
down
a
long
and
narrow
passage
and
then
opening
a
door
down
two
steps
into
the
most
room
i
had
ever
seen
the
walls
were
completely
circular
covered
with
a
paper
of
a
staring
grotesque
pattern
a
small
iron
bedstead
projected
into
the
middle
of
the
floor
which
was
uncarpeted
except
for
a
slip
of
matting
beside
it
a
cheap
deal
a
couple
of
chairs
and
a
small
table
with
a
blurred
stood
against
the
wall
beneath
a
deep
embrasure
in
which
there
was
a
window
this
was
evidently
a
room
in
one
of
the
circular
towers
i
had
never
seen
less
inviting
quarters
your
supper
will
be
ready
directly
sir
said
the
woman
and
placing
the
candle
on
the
little
table
she
left
me
the
place
felt
damp
and
draughty
and
the
flame
of
the
candle
flickered
about
causing
the
tallow
to
gutter
to
one
side
there
was
no
fireplace
in
the
room
and
above
the
walls
converged
to
a
point
giving
the
whole
place
the
appearance
of
an
enormous
extinguisher
i
made
a
hurried
and
necessarily
limited
toilet
and
went
into
the
parlour
i
was
standing
by
the
fire
which
was
burning
badly
when
the
door
opened
and
the
girl
liz
came
in
bearing
a
tray
in
her
hand
she
laid
the
tray
on
the
table
and
came
up
softly
to
me
fools
come
to
this
house
she
said
and
you
are
one
pray
let
me
have
my
supper
and
do
talk
i
replied
i
am
tired
and
hungry
and
want
to
go
to
bed
liz
stood
perfectly
still
for
a
moment
worth
it
she
said
then
in
a
meditative
voice
no
worth
it
but
i
say
no
more
folks
will
never
be
warned
her
grandmother
voice
calling
her
caused
her
to
bound
from
the
room
my
supper
proved
better
than
i
had
expected
and
having
finished
it
i
strolled
into
the
kitchen
anxious
to
have
a
further
talk
with
the
old
man
he
was
seated
alone
by
the
fire
a
great
mastiff
lying
at
his
feet
can
you
tell
me
why
the
house
is
supposed
to
be
haunted
i
asked
suddenly
stooping
down
to
speak
to
him
how
should
i
know
he
cried
hoarsely
the
wife
and
me
have
been
here
twenty
years
and
never
seen
nor
heard
anything
but
for
certain
folks
die
in
the
house
it
mortal
unpleasant
for
me
for
the
doctors
come
along
and
the
coroner
and
there
an
inquest
and
no
end
of
fuss
the
folks
die
although
no
one
has
ever
laid
a
finger
on
the
doctors
ca
prove
why
they
are
dead
but
dead
they
be
well
there
ai
no
use
saying
more
you
are
here
and
maybe
you
pass
the
one
night
all
right
i
shall
go
to
bed
at
once
i
said
but
i
should
like
some
candles
can
you
supply
me
the
man
turned
and
looked
at
his
wife
who
at
that
moment
entered
the
kitchen
she
went
to
the
dresser
opened
a
wooden
box
and
taking
out
three
or
four
tallow
candles
put
them
into
my
hand
i
rose
simulating
a
yawn
sir
said
the
old
man
i
wish
you
well
a
moment
later
i
had
entered
my
bedroom
and
having
shut
the
door
proceeded
to
give
it
a
careful
examination
as
far
as
i
could
make
out
there
was
no
entrance
to
the
room
except
by
the
door
which
was
shaped
to
fit
the
circular
walls
i
noticed
however
that
there
was
an
unaccountable
draught
and
this
i
at
last
discovered
came
from
below
the
oak
wainscoting
of
the
wall
i
could
not
in
any
way
account
for
the
draught
but
it
existed
to
an
unpleasant
extent
the
bed
i
further
saw
was
somewhat
peculiar
it
had
no
castors
on
the
four
legs
which
were
let
down
about
half
an
inch
into
sockets
provided
for
them
in
the
wooden
floor
this
discovery
excited
my
suspicions
still
further
it
was
evident
that
the
bed
was
intended
to
remain
in
a
particular
position
i
saw
that
it
directly
faced
the
little
window
sunk
deep
into
the
thick
wall
so
that
any
one
in
bed
would
look
directly
at
the
window
i
examined
my
watch
found
that
it
was
past
eleven
and
placing
both
the
candles
on
a
tiny
table
near
the
bed
i
lay
down
without
undressing
i
was
on
the
alert
to
catch
the
slightest
noise
but
the
hours
dragged
on
and
nothing
occurred
in
the
house
all
was
silence
and
outside
the
splashing
and
churning
of
the
water
falling
over
the
wheel
came
distinctly
to
my
ears
i
lay
awake
all
night
but
as
morning
dawned
fell
into
an
uneasy
sleep
i
awoke
to
see
the
broad
daylight
streaming
in
at
the
small
window
making
a
hasty
toilet
i
went
out
for
a
walk
and
presently
came
in
to
breakfast
it
had
been
laid
for
me
in
the
big
kitchen
and
the
old
man
was
seated
by
the
hearth
well
said
the
woman
i
hope
you
slept
comfortable
sir
i
answered
in
the
affirmative
and
now
perceived
that
old
bindloss
and
his
wife
were
in
the
humour
to
be
agreeable
they
said
that
if
i
was
satisfied
with
the
room
i
might
spend
another
night
at
the
inn
i
told
them
that
i
had
a
great
many
photographs
to
take
and
would
be
much
obliged
for
the
permission
as
i
spoke
i
looked
round
for
the
girl
liz
she
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
where
is
your
i
asked
of
the
old
woman
she
has
gone
away
for
the
day
was
the
reply
it
too
much
for
liz
to
see
strangers
she
gets
excited
and
then
the
fits
come
on
what
sort
of
fits
i
ca
tell
what
they
are
called
but
they
bad
and
weaken
her
poor
thing
liz
ought
never
to
be
excited
here
bindloss
gave
his
wife
a
warning
glance
she
lowered
her
eyes
and
going
across
to
the
range
began
to
stir
the
contents
of
something
in
a
saucepan
that
afternoon
i
borrowed
some
lines
from
bindloss
and
taking
an
old
boat
which
was
moored
to
the
bank
of
the
set
off
under
the
pretence
of
fishing
for
pike
the
weather
was
perfect
for
the
time
of
year
waiting
my
opportunity
i
brought
the
boat
up
to
land
on
the
bank
that
dammed
up
the
stream
and
getting
out
walked
along
it
in
the
direction
of
the
over
which
the
water
was
now
rushing
as
i
observed
it
from
this
side
of
the
bank
i
saw
that
the
tower
in
which
my
room
was
placed
must
at
one
time
have
been
part
of
the
mill
itself
and
i
further
noticed
that
the
masonry
was
comparatively
new
showing
that
alterations
must
have
taken
place
when
the
house
was
abandoned
as
a
mill
and
was
turned
into
an
inn
i
clambered
down
the
side
of
the
wheel
holding
on
to
the
beams
which
were
green
and
slippery
and
peered
through
the
paddles
as
i
was
making
my
examination
a
voice
suddenly
startled
me
what
are
you
doing
down
there
i
looked
up
old
bindloss
was
standing
on
the
bank
looking
down
at
me
he
was
alone
and
his
face
was
contorted
with
a
queer
mixture
of
fear
and
passion
i
hastily
hoisted
myself
up
and
stood
beside
him
what
are
you
poking
about
down
there
for
he
said
pushing
his
ugly
old
face
into
mine
as
he
spoke
you
fool
if
you
had
fallen
you
would
have
been
drowned
no
one
could
swim
a
stroke
in
that
and
then
there
would
have
been
another
death
and
all
the
old
fuss
over
again
look
here
sir
will
you
have
the
goodness
to
get
out
of
the
place
i
do
want
you
here
any
more
i
intend
to
leave
morning
i
answered
in
a
pacifying
voice
and
i
am
really
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
warning
me
about
the
mill
you
had
best
not
go
near
it
again
he
said
in
a
menacing
voice
and
then
he
turned
hastily
away
i
watched
him
as
he
climbed
up
a
steep
bank
and
disappeared
from
view
he
was
going
in
the
opposite
direction
from
the
house
seizing
the
opportunity
of
his
absence
i
once
more
approached
the
mill
was
it
possible
that
wentworth
had
been
hurled
into
it
but
had
this
been
the
case
there
would
have
been
signs
and
marks
on
the
body
having
reached
the
wheel
i
clambered
boldly
down
it
was
now
getting
dusk
but
i
could
see
that
a
prolongation
of
the
axle
entered
the
wall
of
the
tower
the
fittings
were
also
in
wonderfully
good
order
and
the
bolt
that
held
the
great
wheel
only
required
to
be
drawn
out
to
set
it
in
motion
that
evening
during
supper
i
thought
very
hard
i
perceived
that
bindloss
was
angry
also
that
he
was
suspicious
and
alarmed
i
saw
plainly
that
the
only
way
to
really
discover
what
had
been
done
to
wentworth
was
to
cause
the
old
ruffian
to
try
similar
means
to
get
rid
of
me
this
was
a
dangerous
expedient
but
i
felt
desperate
and
my
curiosity
as
well
as
interest
were
keenly
aroused
having
finished
my
supper
i
went
into
the
passage
preparatory
to
going
into
the
kitchen
i
had
on
felt
slippers
and
my
footfall
made
no
noise
as
i
approached
the
door
i
heard
bindloss
saying
to
his
wife
he
been
poking
about
the
i
wish
he
would
make
himself
scarce
oh
he
ca
find
out
anything
was
the
reply
you
keep
quiet
bindloss
he
be
off
in
the
morning
that
as
maybe
was
the
answer
and
then
there
came
a
harsh
and
very
disagreeable
laugh
i
waited
for
a
moment
and
then
entered
the
kitchen
bindloss
was
alone
now
he
was
bending
over
the
fire
smoking
i
shall
leave
early
in
the
morning
i
said
so
please
have
my
bill
ready
for
me
i
then
seated
myself
near
him
drawing
up
my
chair
close
to
the
blaze
he
looked
as
if
he
resented
this
but
said
nothing
i
am
very
curious
about
the
deaths
which
occur
in
this
house
i
said
after
a
pause
how
many
did
you
say
there
were
that
is
nothing
to
you
he
answered
we
never
wanted
you
here
you
can
go
when
you
please
i
shall
go
morning
but
i
wish
to
say
something
now
and
what
may
that
be
i
do
believe
in
that
story
about
the
place
being
haunted
oh
you
do
do
you
he
dropped
his
pipe
and
his
glittering
eyes
gazed
at
me
with
a
mixture
of
anger
and
alarm
no
i
paused
then
i
said
slowly
and
emphatically
i
went
back
to
the
mill
even
after
your
warning
and
what
he
cried
starting
to
his
feet
nothing
i
answered
only
i
do
believe
in
the
ghost
his
face
turned
not
only
white
but
livid
i
left
him
without
another
word
i
saw
that
his
suspicions
had
been
much
strengthened
by
my
words
this
i
intended
to
induce
the
ruffian
to
do
his
worst
was
the
only
way
to
wring
his
secret
from
him
my
hideous
room
looked
exactly
as
it
had
done
on
the
previous
evening
the
grotesque
pattern
on
the
walls
seemed
to
start
out
in
bold
relief
some
of
the
ugly
lines
seemed
at
that
moment
to
my
imagination
almost
to
take
human
shape
to
convert
themselves
into
faces
and
to
grin
at
me
was
i
too
daring
was
it
wrong
of
me
to
risk
my
life
in
this
manner
i
was
terribly
tired
and
curious
as
it
may
seem
my
greatest
fear
at
that
crucial
moment
was
the
dread
that
i
might
fall
asleep
i
had
spent
two
nights
with
scarcely
any
repose
and
felt
that
at
any
moment
notwithstanding
all
my
efforts
slumber
might
visit
me
in
order
to
give
bindloss
full
opportunity
for
carrying
out
his
scheme
it
was
necessary
for
me
to
get
into
bed
and
even
to
feign
sleep
in
my
present
exhausted
condition
the
pretence
of
slumber
would
easily
lapse
into
the
reality
this
risk
however
which
really
was
a
very
grave
one
must
be
run
without
undressing
i
got
into
bed
pulling
the
well
over
me
in
my
hand
i
held
my
revolver
i
deliberately
put
out
the
candles
and
then
lay
motionless
waiting
for
events
the
house
was
quiet
as
the
grave
there
was
not
a
stir
and
gradually
my
nerves
excited
as
they
were
began
to
calm
down
as
i
had
fully
expected
overpowering
sleepiness
seized
me
and
notwithstanding
every
effort
i
found
myself
drifting
away
into
the
land
of
dreams
i
began
to
wish
that
whatever
apparition
was
to
appear
would
do
so
at
once
and
get
it
over
gradually
but
surely
i
seemed
to
pass
from
all
memory
of
my
present
world
and
to
live
in
a
strange
and
terrible
phantasmagoria
in
that
state
i
slept
in
that
state
also
i
dreamt
and
dreamt
horribly
i
thought
that
i
was
dancing
a
waltz
with
an
enormously
tall
woman
she
towered
above
me
clasping
me
in
her
arms
and
began
to
whirl
me
round
and
round
at
a
giddy
speed
i
could
hear
the
crashing
music
of
a
distant
band
faster
and
faster
round
and
round
some
great
empty
hall
was
i
whirled
i
knew
that
i
was
losing
my
senses
and
screamed
to
her
to
stop
and
let
me
go
suddenly
there
was
a
terrible
crash
close
to
me
good
god
i
found
myself
awake
but
i
was
still
moving
where
was
i
where
was
i
going
i
leapt
up
on
the
bed
only
to
reel
and
fall
heavily
backwards
upon
the
floor
what
was
the
matter
why
was
i
sliding
sliding
had
i
suddenly
gone
mad
or
was
i
still
suffering
from
some
hideous
nightmare
i
tried
to
move
to
stagger
to
my
feet
then
by
slow
degrees
my
senses
began
to
return
and
i
knew
where
i
was
i
was
in
the
circular
room
the
room
where
wentworth
had
died
but
what
was
happening
to
me
i
could
not
divine
i
only
knew
that
i
was
being
whirled
round
and
round
at
a
velocity
that
was
every
moment
increasing
by
the
moonlight
that
struggled
in
through
the
window
i
saw
that
the
floor
and
the
bed
upon
it
was
revolving
but
the
table
was
lying
on
its
side
and
its
fall
must
have
awakened
me
i
could
not
see
any
other
furniture
in
the
room
by
what
mysterious
manner
had
it
been
removed
making
a
great
effort
i
crawled
to
the
centre
of
this
awful
chamber
and
seizing
the
foot
of
the
bed
struggled
to
my
feet
here
i
knew
there
would
be
less
motion
and
i
could
just
manage
to
see
the
outline
of
the
door
i
had
taken
the
precaution
to
slip
the
revolver
into
my
pocket
and
i
still
felt
that
if
human
agency
appeared
i
had
a
chance
of
selling
my
life
dearly
but
surely
the
horror
i
was
passing
through
was
invented
by
no
living
man
as
the
floor
of
the
room
revolved
in
the
direction
of
the
door
i
made
a
dash
for
it
but
was
carried
swiftly
past
and
again
fell
heavily
when
i
came
round
again
i
made
a
frantic
effort
to
cling
to
one
of
the
steps
but
in
vain
the
head
of
the
bedstead
caught
me
as
it
flew
round
and
tore
my
arms
away
in
another
moment
i
believe
i
should
have
gone
raving
mad
with
terror
my
head
felt
as
if
it
would
burst
i
found
it
impossible
to
think
consecutively
the
only
idea
which
really
possessed
me
was
a
mad
wish
to
escape
from
this
hideous
place
i
struggled
to
the
bedstead
and
dragging
the
legs
from
their
sockets
pulled
it
into
the
middle
of
the
room
away
from
the
wall
with
this
out
of
the
way
i
managed
at
last
to
reach
the
door
in
safety
illustration
i
flung
myself
upon
him
a
master
of
page
the
moment
my
hand
grasped
the
handle
i
leapt
upon
the
little
step
and
tried
to
wrench
the
door
open
it
was
locked
locked
from
without
it
defied
my
every
effort
i
had
only
just
standing
room
for
my
feet
below
me
the
floor
of
the
room
was
still
racing
round
with
terrible
speed
i
dared
scarcely
look
at
it
for
the
giddiness
in
my
head
increased
each
moment
the
next
instant
a
soft
footstep
was
distinctly
audible
and
i
saw
a
gleam
of
light
through
a
chink
of
the
door
i
heard
a
hand
fumbling
at
the
lock
the
door
was
slowly
opened
outwards
and
i
saw
the
face
of
bindloss
for
a
moment
he
did
not
perceive
me
for
i
was
crouching
down
on
the
step
and
the
next
instant
with
all
my
force
i
flung
myself
upon
him
he
uttered
a
yell
of
terror
the
lantern
he
carried
dropped
and
went
out
but
i
had
gripped
him
round
the
neck
with
my
fingers
driving
them
deep
down
into
his
lean
sinewy
throat
with
frantic
speed
i
pulled
him
along
the
passage
up
to
a
window
through
which
the
moonlight
was
shining
here
i
released
my
hold
of
his
throat
but
immediately
covered
him
with
my
revolver
down
on
your
knees
or
you
are
a
dead
man
i
cried
confess
everything
or
i
shoot
you
through
the
heart
his
courage
had
evidently
forsaken
him
he
began
to
whimper
and
cry
bitterly
spare
my
life
he
screamed
i
will
tell
everything
only
spare
my
life
be
quick
about
it
i
said
i
am
in
no
humour
to
be
merciful
out
with
the
truth
i
was
listening
anxiously
for
the
wife
step
but
except
for
the
low
hum
of
machinery
and
the
splashing
of
the
water
i
heard
nothing
speak
i
said
giving
the
old
man
a
shake
his
lips
trembled
his
words
came
out
falteringly
it
was
wentworth
doing
he
panted
wentworth
not
the
murdered
man
i
cried
no
no
his
cousin
the
ruffian
who
has
been
the
curse
of
my
life
owing
to
that
last
death
he
inherits
the
property
he
is
the
real
owner
of
the
mill
and
he
invented
the
revolving
floor
there
were
deaths
oh
yes
oh
yes
it
was
so
easy
and
i
wanted
the
money
the
police
never
suspected
nor
did
the
doctors
wentworth
was
bitter
hard
on
me
and
i
got
into
his
power
here
he
choked
and
sobbed
i
am
a
miserable
old
man
sir
he
gasped
so
you
killed
your
victims
for
the
sake
of
money
i
said
grasping
him
by
the
shoulder
yes
he
said
yes
the
bailiff
had
twenty
pounds
all
in
gold
no
one
ever
knew
i
took
it
and
was
able
to
satisfy
wentworth
for
a
bit
and
what
about
archibald
wentworth
that
was
doing
and
i
was
to
be
paid
and
now
finally
you
wanted
to
get
rid
of
me
yes
for
you
suspected
as
i
spoke
i
perceived
by
the
ghastly
light
of
the
moon
another
door
near
i
opened
it
and
saw
that
it
was
the
entrance
to
a
small
dark
lumber
room
i
pushed
the
old
man
in
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
and
ran
downstairs
the
wife
was
still
unaccountably
absent
i
opened
the
front
door
and
trembling
exhausted
drenched
in
perspiration
found
myself
in
the
open
air
every
nerve
was
shaken
at
that
terrible
moment
i
was
not
in
the
least
master
of
myself
my
one
desire
was
to
fly
from
the
hideous
place
i
had
just
reached
the
little
gate
when
a
hand
light
as
a
feather
touched
my
arm
i
looked
up
the
girl
liz
stood
before
me
you
are
saved
she
said
thank
god
i
tried
all
i
could
to
stop
the
wheel
see
i
am
drenched
to
the
skin
i
could
not
manage
it
but
at
least
i
locked
grannie
up
she
in
the
kitchen
sound
asleep
she
drank
a
lot
of
gin
where
were
you
all
day
yesterday
i
asked
locked
up
in
a
room
in
the
further
tower
but
i
managed
to
squeeze
through
the
window
although
it
half
killed
me
i
knew
if
you
stayed
that
they
would
try
it
on
thank
god
you
are
saved
well
do
keep
me
now
i
said
i
have
been
saved
as
by
a
miracle
you
are
a
good
girl
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
you
must
tell
me
another
time
how
you
manage
to
live
through
all
these
horrors
ai
i
all
but
mad
was
her
pathetic
reply
oh
my
god
what
i
suffer
she
pressed
her
hand
to
her
face
the
look
in
her
eyes
was
terrible
but
i
could
not
wait
now
to
talk
to
her
further
i
hastily
left
the
place
how
i
reached
harkhurst
i
can
never
tell
but
early
in
the
morning
i
found
myself
there
i
went
straight
to
stanmore
house
and
having
got
him
up
i
communicated
my
story
he
and
i
together
immediately
visited
the
superintendent
of
police
having
told
my
exciting
tale
we
took
a
trap
and
all
three
returned
to
the
castle
inn
we
were
back
there
before
eight
on
the
following
morning
but
as
the
police
officer
expected
the
place
was
empty
bindloss
had
been
rescued
from
the
dark
closet
and
he
and
his
wife
and
the
girl
liz
had
all
flown
the
doctor
the
police
officer
and
i
all
went
up
to
the
circular
room
we
then
descended
to
the
basement
and
after
a
careful
examination
we
discovered
a
low
door
through
which
we
crept
we
then
found
ourselves
in
a
dark
vault
which
was
full
of
machinery
by
the
light
of
a
lantern
we
examined
it
here
we
saw
an
explanation
of
the
whole
trick
the
shaft
of
the
which
was
let
through
the
wall
of
the
tower
was
as
the
axle
of
a
vertical
cogged
and
by
a
multiplication
action
turned
a
large
horizontal
wheel
into
which
a
vertical
shaft
descended
this
shaft
was
let
into
the
centre
of
four
crossbeams
supporting
the
floor
of
the
room
in
which
i
had
slept
all
round
the
circular
edge
of
the
floor
was
a
steel
rim
which
turned
in
a
circular
socket
it
needed
but
a
touch
to
set
this
hideous
apparatus
in
motion
the
police
immediately
started
in
pursuit
of
bindloss
and
i
returned
to
london
that
evening
edgcombe
and
i
visited
dr
miles
gordon
old
physician
that
he
was
he
was
literally
aghast
when
i
told
him
my
story
he
explained
to
me
that
a
man
placed
in
the
position
in
which
i
was
when
the
floor
began
to
move
would
by
means
of
centrifugal
force
suffer
from
enormous
congestion
of
the
brain
in
fact
the
revolving
floor
would
induce
an
artificial
condition
of
apoplexy
if
the
victim
were
drugged
or
even
only
sleeping
heavily
and
the
floor
began
to
move
slowly
insensibility
would
almost
immediately
be
induced
which
would
soon
pass
into
coma
and
death
and
a
examination
some
hours
afterwards
would
show
no
cause
for
death
as
the
brain
would
appear
perfectly
healthy
the
blood
having
again
left
it
from
the
presence
of
dr
miles
gordon
edgcombe
and
i
went
to
scotland
yard
and
the
whole
affair
was
put
into
the
hands
of
the
london
detective
force
with
the
clue
which
i
had
almost
sacrificed
my
life
to
furnish
they
quickly
did
the
rest
wentworth
was
arrested
and
under
pressure
was
induced
to
make
a
full
confession
but
old
bindloss
had
already
told
me
the
gist
of
the
story
wentworth
father
had
owned
the
mill
had
got
into
trouble
with
the
law
and
changed
his
name
in
fact
he
had
spent
five
years
in
penal
servitude
he
then
went
to
australia
and
made
money
he
died
when
his
son
was
a
young
man
this
youth
inherited
all
the
father
vices
he
came
home
visited
the
mill
and
being
of
a
mechanical
turn
of
mind
invented
the
revolving
floor
he
changed
the
mill
into
an
inn
put
bindloss
one
of
his
pals
into
possession
with
the
full
intention
of
murdering
unwary
travellers
from
time
to
time
for
their
money
the
police
however
wanted
him
for
a
forged
bill
and
he
thought
it
best
to
fly
bindloss
was
left
in
full
possession
worried
by
wentworth
who
had
him
in
his
power
for
a
grave
crime
committed
years
ago
he
himself
on
two
occasions
murdered
a
victim
in
the
circular
room
meanwhile
several
unexpected
deaths
had
taken
place
in
the
older
branch
of
the
wentworth
family
and
archibald
wentworth
alone
stood
between
his
cousin
and
the
great
estates
wentworth
came
home
and
with
the
aid
of
bindloss
got
archibald
into
his
power
the
young
artist
slept
in
the
fatal
room
and
his
death
was
the
result
at
this
moment
wentworth
and
bindloss
are
committed
for
trial
at
the
old
bailey
and
there
is
no
doubt
what
the
result
will
be
the
ghost
mystery
in
connection
with
the
castle
inn
has
of
course
been
explained
away
for
ever
ii
the
warder
of
the
door
if
you
do
believe
it
you
can
read
it
for
yourself
said
allen
clinton
climbing
up
the
steps
and
searching
among
the
volumes
on
the
top
shelf
i
lay
back
in
my
chair
the
beams
from
the
sinking
sun
shone
through
the
stained
glass
of
the
windows
of
the
old
library
and
dyed
the
rows
of
black
leather
volumes
with
bands
of
red
and
yellow
here
bell
i
took
a
musty
volume
from
allen
clinton
which
he
had
unearthed
from
its
it
is
about
the
middle
of
the
book
he
continued
eagerly
you
will
see
it
in
big
black
old
english
letters
i
turned
over
the
pages
containing
the
family
tree
and
other
archives
of
the
clintons
till
i
came
to
the
one
i
was
seeking
it
contained
the
curse
which
had
rested
on
the
family
since
slowly
and
with
difficulty
i
deciphered
the
words
of
this
terrible
denunciation
and
in
this
cell
its
coffin
lieth
the
coffin
which
hath
not
human
shape
for
which
reason
no
holy
ground
receiveth
it
here
shall
it
rest
to
curse
the
family
of
ye
clyntons
from
generation
to
generation
and
for
this
reason
as
soon
as
the
soul
shall
pass
from
the
body
of
each
which
is
the
heir
it
shall
become
the
warder
of
the
door
by
day
and
by
night
day
and
night
shall
his
spirit
stand
by
the
door
to
keep
the
door
closed
till
the
son
shall
release
the
spirit
of
the
father
from
the
watch
and
take
his
place
till
his
son
in
turn
shall
die
and
whoso
entereth
into
the
cell
shall
be
the
prisoner
of
the
soul
that
guardeth
the
door
till
it
shall
let
him
go
what
a
ghastly
idea
i
said
glancing
up
at
the
young
man
who
was
watching
me
as
i
read
but
you
say
this
cell
has
never
been
found
i
should
say
its
existence
was
a
myth
and
of
course
the
curse
on
the
soul
of
the
to
keep
the
door
shut
as
warder
is
absurd
matter
does
not
obey
witchcraft
the
odd
part
of
it
is
replied
allen
that
every
other
detail
of
the
abbey
referred
to
in
this
record
has
been
identified
but
this
cell
with
its
horrible
contents
has
never
been
found
it
certainly
was
a
curious
legend
and
i
allow
it
made
some
impression
on
me
i
fancied
too
that
somewhere
i
had
heard
something
similar
but
my
memory
failed
to
trace
it
i
had
come
down
to
clinton
abbey
three
days
before
for
some
pheasant
shooting
it
was
now
sunday
afternoon
the
family
with
the
exception
of
old
sir
henry
allen
and
myself
were
at
church
sir
henry
now
nearly
eighty
years
of
age
and
a
chronic
invalid
had
retired
to
his
room
for
his
afternoon
sleep
the
younger
clinton
and
i
had
gone
out
for
a
stroll
round
the
grounds
and
since
we
returned
our
conversation
had
run
upon
the
family
history
till
it
arrived
at
the
legend
of
the
family
curse
presently
the
door
of
the
library
was
slowly
opened
and
sir
henry
in
his
black
velvet
coat
which
formed
such
a
striking
contrast
to
his
snowy
white
beard
and
hair
entered
the
room
i
rose
from
my
chair
and
giving
him
my
arm
assisted
him
to
his
favourite
couch
he
sank
down
into
its
luxurious
depths
with
a
sigh
but
as
he
did
so
his
eyes
caught
the
old
volume
which
i
had
laid
on
the
table
beside
it
he
started
forward
took
the
book
in
his
hand
and
looked
across
at
his
son
did
you
take
this
book
down
he
said
sharply
yes
father
i
got
it
out
to
show
it
to
bell
he
is
interested
in
the
history
of
the
abbey
and
then
return
it
to
its
place
at
once
interrupted
the
old
man
his
black
eyes
blazing
with
sudden
passion
you
know
how
i
dislike
having
my
books
disarranged
and
this
one
above
all
stay
give
it
to
me
he
struggled
up
from
the
couch
and
taking
the
volume
locked
it
up
in
one
of
the
drawers
of
his
and
then
sat
back
again
on
the
sofa
his
hands
were
trembling
as
if
some
sudden
fear
had
taken
possession
of
him
did
you
say
that
phyllis
curzon
is
coming
asked
the
old
man
presently
of
his
son
in
an
irritable
voice
yes
father
of
course
do
you
remember
curzon
and
phyllis
are
coming
to
stay
for
a
fortnight
and
by
the
way
he
added
starting
to
his
feet
as
he
spoke
that
reminds
me
i
must
go
and
tell
grace
the
rest
of
the
sentence
was
lost
in
the
closing
of
the
door
as
soon
as
we
were
alone
sir
henry
looked
across
at
me
for
a
few
moments
without
speaking
then
he
said
i
am
sorry
i
was
so
short
just
now
i
am
not
myself
i
do
not
know
what
is
the
matter
with
me
i
feel
all
to
pieces
i
can
not
sleep
i
do
not
think
my
time
is
very
long
now
and
i
am
worried
about
allen
the
fact
is
i
would
give
anything
to
stop
this
engagement
i
wish
he
would
not
marry
i
am
sorry
to
hear
you
say
that
sir
i
answered
i
should
have
thought
you
would
have
been
anxious
to
see
your
son
happily
married
most
men
would
was
the
reply
but
i
have
my
reasons
for
wishing
things
otherwise
what
do
you
mean
i
could
not
help
asking
i
can
not
explain
myself
i
wish
i
could
it
would
be
best
for
allen
to
let
the
old
family
die
out
there
perhaps
i
am
foolish
about
it
and
of
course
i
can
not
really
stop
the
marriage
but
i
am
worried
and
troubled
about
many
things
i
wish
i
could
help
you
sir
i
said
impulsively
if
there
is
anything
i
can
possibly
do
you
know
you
have
only
to
ask
me
thank
you
bell
i
know
you
would
but
i
can
not
tell
you
some
day
i
may
but
there
i
am
afraid
horribly
afraid
the
trembling
again
seized
him
and
he
put
his
hands
over
his
eyes
as
if
to
shut
out
some
terrible
sight
do
repeat
a
word
of
what
i
have
told
you
to
allen
or
any
one
else
he
said
suddenly
it
is
possible
that
some
day
i
may
ask
you
to
help
me
and
remember
bell
i
trust
you
he
held
out
his
hand
which
i
took
in
another
moment
the
butler
entered
with
the
lamps
and
i
took
advantage
of
the
interruption
to
make
my
way
to
the
the
next
day
the
curzons
arrived
and
a
hasty
glance
showed
me
that
phyllis
was
a
charming
girl
she
was
tall
slightly
built
with
a
figure
both
upright
and
graceful
and
a
handsome
somewhat
proud
face
when
in
perfect
repose
her
expression
was
somewhat
haughty
but
the
moment
she
spoke
her
face
became
vivacious
kindly
charming
to
an
extraordinary
degree
she
had
a
gay
laugh
a
sweet
smile
a
sympathetic
manner
i
was
certain
she
had
the
kindest
of
hearts
and
was
sure
that
allen
had
made
an
admirable
choice
a
few
days
went
by
and
at
last
the
evening
before
the
day
when
i
was
to
return
to
london
arrived
phyllis
mother
had
gone
to
bed
a
short
time
before
as
she
had
complained
of
headache
and
allen
suddenly
proposed
as
the
night
was
a
perfect
one
that
we
should
go
out
and
enjoy
a
moonlight
stroll
phyllis
laughed
with
glee
at
the
suggestion
and
ran
at
once
into
the
hall
to
take
a
wrap
from
one
of
the
pegs
allen
she
said
to
her
lover
who
was
following
her
you
and
i
will
go
first
no
young
lady
on
this
occasion
you
and
i
will
have
that
privilege
said
sir
henry
he
had
also
come
into
the
hall
and
to
our
astonishment
announced
his
intention
of
accompanying
us
in
our
walk
phyllis
bestowed
upon
him
a
startled
glance
then
she
laid
her
hand
lightly
on
his
arm
nodded
back
at
allen
with
a
smile
and
walked
on
in
front
somewhat
rapidly
allen
and
i
followed
in
the
rear
now
what
does
my
father
mean
by
this
said
allen
to
me
he
never
goes
out
at
night
but
he
has
not
been
well
lately
i
sometimes
think
he
grows
queerer
every
day
he
is
very
far
from
well
i
am
certain
i
answered
we
stayed
out
for
about
half
an
hour
and
returned
home
by
a
path
which
led
into
the
house
through
a
side
entrance
phyllis
was
waiting
for
us
in
the
hall
where
is
my
father
asked
allen
going
up
to
her
he
is
tired
and
has
gone
to
bed
she
answered
allen
wo
you
come
into
the
he
asked
in
some
astonishment
no
i
am
tired
she
nodded
to
him
without
touching
his
hand
her
eyes
i
could
not
help
noticing
had
a
queer
expression
she
ran
upstairs
i
saw
that
allen
was
startled
by
her
manner
but
as
he
did
not
say
anything
neither
did
i
the
next
day
at
breakfast
i
was
told
that
the
curzons
had
already
left
the
abbey
allen
was
full
of
astonishment
and
i
could
see
a
good
deal
annoyed
he
and
i
breakfasted
alone
in
the
old
library
his
father
was
too
ill
to
come
downstairs
an
hour
later
i
was
on
my
way
back
to
london
many
things
there
engaged
my
immediate
attention
and
allen
his
engagement
sir
henry
and
the
old
family
curse
sank
more
or
less
into
the
background
of
my
mind
three
months
afterwards
on
the
of
january
i
saw
to
my
sorrow
in
the
the
announcement
of
sir
henry
clinton
death
from
time
to
time
in
the
interim
i
had
heard
from
the
son
saying
that
his
father
was
failing
fast
he
further
mentioned
that
his
own
wedding
was
fixed
for
the
of
the
present
month
now
of
course
it
must
be
postponed
i
felt
truly
sorry
for
allen
and
wrote
immediately
a
long
letter
of
condolence
on
the
following
day
i
received
a
wire
from
him
imploring
me
to
go
down
to
the
abbey
as
soon
as
possible
saying
that
he
was
in
great
difficulty
i
packed
a
few
things
hastily
and
arrived
at
clinton
abbey
at
six
in
the
evening
the
house
was
silent
and
subdued
the
funeral
was
to
take
place
the
next
day
clinton
came
into
the
hall
and
gripped
me
warmly
by
the
hand
i
noticed
at
once
how
worn
and
worried
he
looked
this
is
good
of
you
bell
he
said
i
can
not
tell
you
how
grateful
i
am
to
you
for
coming
you
are
the
one
man
who
can
help
me
for
i
know
you
have
had
much
experience
in
matters
of
this
sort
come
into
the
library
and
i
will
tell
you
everything
we
shall
dine
alone
this
evening
as
my
mother
and
the
girls
are
keeping
to
their
own
apartments
for
as
soon
as
we
were
seated
he
plunged
at
once
into
his
story
i
must
give
you
a
sort
of
prelude
to
what
has
just
occurred
he
began
you
remember
when
you
were
last
here
how
abruptly
phyllis
and
her
mother
left
the
abbey
i
nodded
i
remembered
well
on
the
morning
after
you
had
left
us
i
had
a
long
letter
from
phyllis
continued
allen
in
it
she
told
me
of
an
extraordinary
request
my
father
had
made
to
her
during
that
moonlight
walk
nothing
more
nor
less
than
an
earnest
wish
that
she
would
herself
terminate
our
engagement
she
spoke
quite
frankly
as
she
always
does
assuring
me
of
her
unalterable
love
and
devotion
but
saying
that
under
the
circumstances
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
have
an
explanation
frantic
with
almost
ungovernable
rage
i
sought
my
father
in
his
study
i
laid
letter
before
him
and
asked
him
what
it
meant
he
looked
at
me
with
the
most
unutterable
expression
of
weariness
and
pathos
my
boy
i
did
it
he
said
is
quite
right
i
did
ask
of
her
as
earnestly
as
a
very
old
man
could
plead
that
she
would
bring
the
engagement
to
an
end
why
i
asked
i
am
unable
to
tell
you
he
replied
i
lost
my
temper
and
said
some
words
to
him
which
i
now
regret
he
made
no
sort
of
reply
when
i
had
done
speaking
he
said
slowly
make
all
allowance
for
your
emotion
allen
your
feelings
are
no
more
than
natural
have
done
me
a
very
sore
injury
i
retorted
can
phyllis
think
of
this
she
will
never
be
the
same
again
i
am
going
to
see
her
he
did
not
utter
another
word
and
i
left
him
i
was
absent
from
home
for
about
a
week
it
took
me
nearly
that
time
to
induce
phyllis
to
overlook
my
father
extraordinary
request
and
to
let
matters
go
on
exactly
as
they
had
done
before
after
fixing
our
engagement
if
possible
more
firmly
than
ever
and
also
arranging
the
date
of
our
wedding
i
returned
home
when
i
did
so
i
told
my
father
what
i
had
done
you
will
he
replied
and
then
he
sank
into
great
gloom
from
that
moment
although
i
watched
him
day
and
night
and
did
everything
that
love
and
tenderness
could
suggest
he
never
seemed
to
rally
he
scarcely
spoke
and
remained
whenever
we
were
together
bowed
in
deep
and
painful
reverie
a
week
ago
he
took
to
his
bed
here
allen
paused
i
now
come
to
events
up
to
date
he
said
of
course
as
you
may
suppose
i
was
with
my
father
to
the
last
a
few
hours
before
he
passed
away
he
called
me
to
his
bedside
and
to
my
astonishment
began
once
more
talking
about
my
engagement
he
implored
me
with
the
utmost
earnestness
even
now
at
the
eleventh
hour
to
break
it
off
it
was
not
too
late
he
said
and
added
further
that
nothing
would
give
him
ease
in
dying
but
the
knowledge
that
i
would
promise
him
to
remain
single
of
course
i
tried
to
humour
him
he
took
my
hand
looked
me
in
the
eyes
with
an
expression
which
i
shall
never
forget
and
said
make
me
a
solemn
promise
that
you
will
never
marry
this
i
naturally
had
to
refuse
and
then
he
told
me
that
expecting
my
obstinacy
he
had
written
me
a
letter
which
i
should
find
in
his
safe
but
i
was
not
to
open
it
till
after
his
death
i
found
it
this
morning
bell
it
is
the
most
extraordinary
communication
and
either
it
is
entirely
a
figment
of
his
imagination
for
his
brain
powers
were
failing
very
much
at
the
last
or
else
it
is
the
most
awful
thing
i
ever
heard
of
here
is
the
letter
read
it
for
yourself
i
took
the
paper
from
his
hand
and
read
the
following
matter
in
shaky
almost
illegible
writing
my
dear
boy
when
you
read
this
i
shall
have
passed
away
for
the
last
six
months
my
life
has
been
a
living
death
the
horror
began
in
the
following
way
you
know
what
a
deep
interest
i
have
always
taken
in
the
family
history
of
our
house
i
have
spent
the
latter
years
of
my
life
in
verifying
each
detail
and
my
intention
was
had
health
been
given
me
to
publish
a
great
deal
of
it
in
a
suitable
volume
on
the
special
night
to
which
i
am
about
to
allude
i
sat
up
late
in
my
study
reading
the
book
which
i
saw
you
show
to
bell
a
short
time
ago
in
particular
i
was
much
attracted
by
the
terrible
curse
which
the
old
abbot
in
the
fourteenth
century
had
bestowed
upon
the
family
i
read
the
awful
words
again
and
again
i
knew
that
all
the
other
details
in
the
volume
had
been
verified
but
that
the
vault
with
the
coffin
had
never
yet
been
found
presently
i
grew
drowsy
and
i
suppose
i
must
have
fallen
asleep
in
my
sleep
i
had
a
dream
i
thought
that
some
one
came
into
the
room
touched
me
on
the
shoulder
and
said
i
looked
up
a
tall
figure
beckoned
to
me
the
voice
and
the
figure
belonged
to
my
late
father
in
my
dream
i
rose
immediately
although
i
did
not
know
why
i
went
nor
where
i
was
going
the
figure
went
on
in
front
it
entered
the
hall
i
took
one
of
the
candles
from
the
table
and
the
key
of
the
chapel
unbolted
the
door
and
went
out
still
the
voice
kept
saying
come
and
the
figure
of
my
father
walked
in
front
of
me
i
went
across
the
quadrangle
unlocked
the
chapel
door
and
entered
a
silence
was
around
me
i
crossed
the
nave
to
the
north
aisle
the
figure
still
went
in
front
of
me
it
entered
the
great
pew
which
is
said
to
be
haunted
and
walked
straight
up
to
the
effigy
of
the
old
abbot
who
had
pronounced
the
curse
this
as
you
know
is
built
into
the
opposite
wall
bending
forward
the
figure
pressed
the
eyes
of
the
old
monk
and
immediately
a
stone
started
out
of
its
place
revealing
a
staircase
behind
i
was
about
to
hurry
forward
when
i
must
have
knocked
against
something
i
felt
a
sensation
of
pain
and
suddenly
awoke
what
was
my
amazement
to
find
that
i
had
acted
on
my
dream
had
crossed
the
quadrangle
and
was
in
the
chapel
in
fact
was
standing
in
the
old
pew
of
course
there
was
no
figure
of
any
sort
visible
but
the
moonlight
shed
a
cold
radiance
over
all
the
place
i
felt
very
much
startled
and
impressed
but
was
just
about
to
return
to
the
house
in
some
wonder
at
the
curious
vision
which
i
had
experienced
when
raising
my
startled
eyes
i
saw
that
part
of
it
at
least
was
real
the
old
monk
seemed
to
grin
at
me
from
his
marble
effigy
and
beside
him
was
a
open
i
hurried
to
it
and
saw
a
narrow
flight
of
stairs
i
can
not
explain
what
my
emotions
were
but
my
keenest
feeling
at
that
moment
was
a
strong
and
horrible
curiosity
holding
the
candle
in
my
hand
i
went
down
the
steps
they
terminated
at
the
beginning
of
a
long
passage
this
i
quickly
traversed
and
at
last
found
myself
beside
an
iron
door
it
was
not
locked
but
hasped
and
was
very
hard
to
open
in
fact
it
required
nearly
all
my
strength
at
last
i
pulled
it
open
towards
me
and
there
in
a
small
cell
lay
the
coffin
as
the
words
of
the
curse
said
i
gazed
at
it
in
horror
i
did
not
dare
to
enter
it
was
a
shaped
coffin
studded
with
great
nails
but
as
i
looked
my
blood
froze
within
me
for
slowly
very
slowly
as
if
pushed
by
some
unseen
hand
the
great
heavy
door
began
to
close
quicker
and
quicker
until
with
a
crash
that
echoed
and
through
the
empty
vault
it
shut
i
rushed
from
the
vault
and
reached
my
room
once
more
now
i
know
that
this
great
curse
is
true
that
my
spirit
is
there
to
guard
the
door
and
close
it
for
i
saw
it
with
my
own
eyes
and
while
you
read
this
know
that
i
am
there
i
charge
you
therefore
not
to
marry
bring
no
child
into
the
world
to
perpetuate
this
terrible
curse
let
the
family
die
out
if
you
have
the
courage
it
is
much
i
know
to
ask
but
whether
you
do
or
not
come
to
me
there
and
if
by
sign
or
word
i
can
communicate
with
you
i
will
do
so
but
hold
the
secret
safe
meet
me
there
before
my
body
is
laid
to
rest
when
body
and
soul
are
still
not
far
from
each
other
your
loving
father
henry
clinton
i
read
this
strange
letter
over
carefully
twice
and
laid
it
down
for
a
moment
i
hardly
knew
what
to
say
it
was
certainly
the
most
uncanny
thing
i
had
ever
come
across
what
do
you
think
of
it
asked
allen
at
last
well
of
course
there
are
only
two
possible
solutions
i
answered
one
is
that
your
father
not
only
dreamt
the
beginning
of
this
story
which
remember
he
allows
himself
but
the
whole
of
it
and
the
other
asked
allen
seeing
that
i
paused
the
other
i
continued
i
hardly
know
what
to
say
yet
of
course
we
will
investigate
the
whole
thing
that
is
our
only
chance
of
arriving
at
a
solution
it
is
absurd
to
let
matters
rest
as
they
are
we
had
better
try
clinton
winced
and
hesitated
something
must
be
done
of
course
he
answered
but
the
worst
of
it
is
phyllis
and
her
mother
are
coming
here
early
in
time
for
the
funeral
and
i
can
not
meet
her
no
i
can
not
poor
girl
while
i
feel
as
i
do
we
will
go
to
the
vault
i
said
clinton
rose
from
his
chair
and
looked
at
me
i
do
like
this
thing
at
all
bell
he
continued
i
am
not
by
nature
in
any
sense
of
the
word
a
superstitious
man
but
i
tell
you
frankly
nothing
would
induce
me
to
go
alone
into
that
chapel
if
you
come
with
me
that
of
course
alters
matters
i
know
the
pew
my
father
refers
to
well
it
is
beneath
the
window
of
st
sebastian
soon
afterwards
i
went
to
my
room
and
dressed
and
allen
and
i
dined
in
the
great
the
old
butler
waited
on
us
with
funereal
solemnity
and
i
did
all
i
could
to
lure
thoughts
into
a
more
cheerful
and
healthier
channel
i
can
not
say
that
i
was
very
successful
i
further
noticed
that
he
scarcely
ate
anything
and
seemed
altogether
to
be
in
a
state
of
nervous
tension
painful
to
witness
after
dinner
we
went
into
the
and
at
eleven
i
proposed
that
we
should
make
a
start
clinton
braced
himself
together
and
we
went
out
he
got
the
chapel
keys
and
then
going
to
the
stables
we
borrowed
a
lantern
and
a
moment
afterwards
found
ourselves
in
the
sacred
edifice
the
moon
was
at
her
full
and
by
the
pale
light
which
was
diffused
through
the
south
windows
the
architecture
of
the
interior
could
be
faintly
seen
the
gothic
arches
that
flanked
the
centre
aisle
with
their
quaint
pillars
each
with
a
carved
figure
of
one
of
the
saints
were
quite
visible
and
further
in
the
darkness
of
the
chancel
the
dim
outlines
of
the
choir
and
with
its
white
marble
reredos
could
be
just
discerned
we
closed
the
door
softly
and
clinton
leading
the
way
with
the
lantern
we
walked
up
the
centre
aisle
paved
with
the
brasses
of
his
dead
ancestors
we
trod
gently
on
tiptoe
as
one
instinctively
does
at
night
turning
beneath
the
little
pulpit
we
reached
the
north
transept
and
here
clinton
stopped
and
turned
round
he
was
very
white
but
his
voice
was
quiet
this
is
the
pew
he
whispered
it
has
always
been
called
the
haunted
pew
of
sir
hugh
clinton
i
took
the
lantern
from
him
and
we
entered
i
crossed
the
pew
immediately
and
went
up
to
the
effigy
of
the
old
abbot
let
us
examine
him
closely
i
said
i
held
up
the
lantern
getting
it
to
shine
on
each
part
of
the
face
the
vestments
and
the
figure
the
eyes
although
vacant
as
in
all
statuary
seemed
to
me
at
that
moment
to
be
uncanny
and
peculiar
giving
allen
the
lantern
to
hold
i
placed
a
finger
firmly
on
each
the
next
moment
i
could
not
refrain
from
an
exclamation
a
stone
at
the
side
immediately
rolled
back
revealing
the
steps
which
were
spoken
of
by
the
old
man
in
his
narrative
it
is
true
it
is
true
cried
clinton
excitedly
it
certainly
looks
like
it
i
remarked
but
never
mind
we
have
the
chance
now
of
investigating
this
matter
thoroughly
are
you
going
down
asked
clinton
certainly
i
am
i
replied
let
us
go
together
immediately
afterwards
we
crept
through
the
opening
and
began
to
descend
there
was
only
just
room
to
do
so
in
single
file
and
i
went
first
with
the
lantern
in
another
moment
we
were
in
the
long
passage
and
soon
we
were
confronted
by
a
door
in
an
arched
stone
framework
up
till
now
clinton
had
shown
little
sign
of
alarm
but
here
at
the
to
which
his
father
soul
had
summoned
him
he
seemed
suddenly
to
lose
his
nerve
he
leant
against
the
wall
and
for
a
moment
i
thought
he
would
have
fallen
i
held
up
the
lantern
and
examined
the
door
and
walls
carefully
then
approaching
i
lifted
the
iron
latch
of
the
heavy
door
it
was
very
hard
to
move
but
at
last
by
seizing
the
edge
i
dragged
it
open
to
its
full
against
the
wall
of
the
passage
having
done
so
i
peered
inside
holding
the
lantern
above
my
head
as
i
did
so
i
heard
clinton
cry
out
look
look
he
said
and
turning
i
saw
that
the
great
door
had
swung
back
against
me
almost
shutting
me
within
the
cell
telling
clinton
to
hold
it
back
by
force
i
stepped
inside
and
saw
at
my
feet
the
ghastly
coffin
the
legend
then
so
far
was
true
i
bent
down
and
examined
the
queer
misshapen
thing
with
great
care
its
shape
was
that
of
an
enormous
wedge
and
it
was
apparently
made
of
some
dark
old
wood
and
was
bound
with
iron
at
the
corners
having
looked
at
it
all
round
i
went
out
and
flinging
back
the
door
which
clinton
had
been
holding
open
stood
aside
to
watch
slowly
very
slowly
as
we
both
stood
in
the
passage
slowly
as
if
pushed
by
some
invisible
hand
the
door
commenced
to
swing
round
and
increasing
in
velocity
shut
with
a
noisy
clang
seizing
it
once
again
i
dragged
it
open
and
while
clinton
held
it
in
that
position
made
a
careful
examination
up
to
the
present
i
saw
nothing
to
be
much
alarmed
about
there
were
fifty
ways
in
which
a
door
might
shut
of
its
own
accord
there
might
be
a
hidden
spring
or
tilted
hinges
draught
of
course
was
out
of
the
question
i
looked
at
the
hinges
they
were
of
iron
and
set
in
the
solid
masonry
nor
could
i
discover
any
spring
or
hidden
contrivance
as
when
the
door
was
wide
open
there
was
an
interval
of
several
inches
between
it
and
the
wall
we
tried
it
again
and
again
with
the
same
result
and
at
last
as
it
was
closing
i
seized
it
to
prevent
it
i
now
experienced
a
very
odd
sensation
i
certainly
felt
as
if
i
were
resisting
an
unseen
person
who
was
pressing
hard
against
the
door
at
the
other
side
directly
it
was
released
it
continued
its
course
i
allow
i
was
quite
unable
to
understand
the
mystery
suddenly
an
idea
struck
me
what
does
the
legend
say
i
asked
turning
to
clinton
the
soul
is
to
guard
the
door
to
close
it
upon
the
coffin
those
are
the
words
answered
allen
speaking
with
some
difficulty
now
if
that
is
true
i
continued
and
we
take
the
coffin
out
the
spirit
wo
shut
the
door
if
it
does
shut
it
it
disproves
the
whole
thing
at
once
and
shows
it
to
be
merely
a
clever
mechanical
contrivance
come
clinton
help
me
to
get
the
coffin
out
i
dare
not
bell
he
whispered
hoarsely
i
dare
go
inside
nonsense
man
i
said
feeling
now
a
little
annoyed
at
the
whole
thing
here
put
the
lantern
down
and
hold
the
door
back
i
stepped
in
and
getting
behind
the
coffin
put
out
all
my
strength
and
shoved
it
into
the
passage
now
then
i
cried
i
bet
you
fifty
pounds
to
five
the
door
will
shut
just
the
same
i
dragged
the
coffin
clear
of
the
door
and
told
him
to
let
go
clinton
had
scarcely
done
so
before
stepping
back
he
clutched
my
arm
look
he
whispered
do
you
see
that
it
will
not
shut
now
my
father
is
waiting
for
the
coffin
to
be
put
back
this
is
awful
i
gazed
at
the
door
in
horror
it
was
perfectly
true
it
remained
wide
open
and
quite
still
i
sprang
forward
seized
it
and
now
endeavoured
to
close
it
it
was
as
if
some
one
was
trying
to
hold
it
open
it
required
considerable
force
to
stir
it
and
it
was
only
with
difficulty
i
could
move
it
at
all
at
last
i
managed
to
shut
it
but
the
moment
i
let
go
it
swung
back
open
of
its
own
accord
and
struck
against
the
wall
where
it
remained
just
as
before
in
the
dead
silence
that
followed
i
could
hear
clinton
breathing
quickly
behind
me
and
i
knew
he
was
holding
himself
for
all
he
was
worth
at
that
moment
there
suddenly
came
over
me
a
sensation
which
i
had
once
experienced
before
and
which
i
was
twice
destined
to
experience
again
it
is
impossible
to
describe
it
but
it
seized
me
laying
siege
to
my
brain
till
i
felt
like
a
child
in
its
power
it
was
as
if
i
were
slowly
drowning
in
the
great
ocean
of
silence
that
enveloped
us
time
itself
seemed
to
have
disappeared
at
my
feet
lay
the
misshapen
thing
and
the
lantern
behind
it
cast
a
fantastic
shadow
of
its
distorted
outline
on
the
cell
wall
before
me
speak
say
something
i
cried
to
clinton
the
sharp
sound
of
my
voice
broke
the
spell
i
felt
myself
again
and
smiled
at
the
trick
my
nerves
had
played
on
me
i
bent
down
and
once
more
laid
my
hands
on
the
coffin
but
before
i
had
time
to
push
it
back
into
its
place
clinton
had
gone
up
the
passage
like
a
man
who
is
flying
to
escape
a
hurled
javelin
exerting
all
my
force
to
prevent
the
door
from
swinging
back
by
keeping
my
leg
against
it
i
had
just
got
the
coffin
into
the
cell
and
was
going
out
when
i
heard
a
shrill
cry
and
clinton
came
tearing
back
down
the
passage
i
ca
get
out
the
stone
has
sunk
into
its
place
we
are
locked
in
he
screamed
and
wild
with
fear
he
plunged
headlong
into
the
cell
upsetting
me
in
his
career
before
i
could
check
him
i
sprang
back
to
the
door
as
it
was
closing
i
was
too
late
before
i
could
reach
it
it
had
shut
with
a
loud
clang
in
obedience
to
the
infernal
witchcraft
you
have
done
it
now
i
cried
angrily
do
you
see
why
man
we
are
buried
alive
in
this
ghastly
hole
the
lantern
i
had
placed
just
inside
the
door
and
by
its
dim
light
as
i
looked
at
him
i
saw
the
terror
of
a
madman
creep
into
clinton
eyes
buried
alive
he
shouted
with
a
peal
of
hysterical
laughter
yes
and
bell
it
your
doing
you
are
a
devil
in
human
shape
with
a
wild
paroxysm
of
fury
he
flung
himself
upon
me
there
was
the
ferocity
of
a
wild
beast
in
his
spring
he
upset
the
lantern
and
left
us
in
total
darkness
the
struggle
was
short
we
might
be
buried
alive
but
i
was
not
going
to
die
by
his
hand
and
seizing
him
by
the
throat
i
pinned
him
against
the
wall
illustration
it
had
shut
with
a
loud
clang
a
master
of
page
keep
quiet
i
shouted
it
is
your
thundering
stupidity
that
has
caused
all
this
stay
where
you
are
until
i
strike
a
match
i
luckily
had
some
vestas
in
the
little
silver
box
which
i
always
carry
on
my
and
striking
one
i
relit
the
lantern
paroxysm
was
over
and
sinking
to
the
floor
he
lay
there
shivering
and
cowering
it
was
a
terrible
situation
and
i
knew
that
our
only
hope
was
for
me
to
keep
my
presence
of
mind
with
a
great
effort
i
forced
myself
to
think
calmly
over
what
could
be
done
to
shout
for
help
would
have
been
but
a
useless
waste
of
breath
suddenly
an
idea
struck
me
have
you
got
your
father
letter
i
cried
eagerly
i
have
he
answered
it
is
in
my
pocket
my
last
ray
of
hope
vanished
our
only
chance
was
that
if
he
had
left
it
at
the
house
some
one
might
discover
the
letter
and
come
to
our
rescue
by
its
instructions
it
had
been
a
faint
hope
and
it
disappeared
almost
as
quickly
as
it
had
come
to
me
without
it
no
one
would
ever
find
the
way
to
the
vault
that
had
remained
a
secret
for
ages
i
was
determined
however
not
to
die
without
a
struggle
for
freedom
taking
the
lantern
i
examined
every
nook
and
cranny
of
the
cell
for
some
other
exit
it
was
a
fruitless
search
no
sign
of
any
way
out
could
i
find
and
we
had
absolutely
no
means
to
unfasten
the
door
from
the
inner
side
taking
a
few
short
steps
i
flung
myself
again
and
again
at
the
heavy
door
it
never
budged
an
inch
and
bruised
and
sweating
at
every
pore
i
sat
down
on
the
coffin
and
tried
to
collect
all
my
faculties
clinton
was
silent
and
seemed
utterly
stunned
he
sat
still
gazing
with
a
vacant
stare
at
the
door
the
time
dragged
heavily
and
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
wait
for
a
horrible
death
from
starvation
it
was
more
than
likely
too
that
clinton
would
go
mad
already
his
nerves
were
strained
to
the
utmost
altogether
i
had
never
found
myself
in
a
worse
plight
it
seemed
like
an
eternity
that
we
sat
there
neither
of
us
speaking
a
word
over
and
over
again
i
repeated
to
myself
the
words
of
the
terrible
curse
and
whoso
entereth
into
the
cell
shall
be
the
prisoner
of
the
soul
that
guardeth
the
door
till
it
shall
let
him
go
when
would
the
shapeless
form
that
was
inside
the
coffin
let
us
go
doubtless
when
our
bones
were
dry
i
looked
at
my
watch
it
was
eleven
surely
we
had
been
more
than
ten
minutes
in
this
awful
place
we
had
left
the
house
at
eleven
and
i
knew
that
must
have
been
many
hours
ago
i
glanced
at
the
second
hand
watch
had
what
is
the
time
clinton
i
asked
my
watch
has
stopped
what
does
it
matter
he
murmured
what
is
time
to
us
now
the
sooner
we
die
the
better
he
pulled
out
his
watch
as
he
spoke
and
held
it
to
the
lantern
minutes
past
eleven
he
murmured
dreamily
good
heavens
i
cried
starting
up
has
your
watch
stopped
too
then
like
the
leap
of
a
lightning
flash
an
idea
struck
me
i
have
got
it
i
have
got
it
my
god
i
believe
i
have
got
it
i
cried
seizing
him
by
the
arm
got
what
he
replied
staring
wildly
at
me
why
the
secret
the
curse
the
door
do
you
see
i
pulled
out
the
large
knife
i
always
carry
by
a
chain
and
swivel
in
my
trouser
pocket
and
telling
clinton
to
hold
the
lantern
opened
the
little
and
attacked
the
coffin
with
it
i
believe
the
secret
of
our
deliverance
lies
in
this
i
panted
working
away
furiously
in
ten
minutes
i
had
sawn
half
through
the
wooden
edge
then
handing
my
tool
to
clinton
i
told
him
to
continue
the
work
while
i
rested
after
a
few
minutes
i
took
the
knife
again
and
at
last
after
nearly
half
an
hour
had
gone
by
succeeded
in
making
a
small
hole
in
the
lid
inserting
my
two
fingers
i
felt
some
rough
uneven
masses
i
was
now
fearfully
excited
tearing
at
the
opening
like
a
madman
i
enlarged
it
and
extracted
what
looked
like
a
large
piece
of
coal
i
knew
in
an
instant
what
it
was
it
was
magnetic
holding
it
down
to
my
knife
the
blade
flew
to
it
here
is
the
mystery
of
the
soul
i
cried
now
we
can
use
it
to
open
the
door
i
had
known
a
great
conjurer
once
who
had
deceived
and
puzzled
his
audience
with
a
box
trick
on
similar
lines
the
man
opening
the
box
from
the
inside
by
drawing
down
the
lock
with
a
magnet
would
this
do
the
same
i
felt
that
our
lives
hung
on
the
next
moment
taking
the
mass
i
pressed
it
against
the
door
just
opposite
the
hasp
and
slid
it
up
against
the
wood
my
heart
leapt
as
i
heard
the
hasp
fly
up
outside
and
with
a
push
the
door
opened
we
are
saved
i
shouted
we
are
saved
by
a
miracle
bell
you
are
a
genius
gasped
poor
clinton
but
now
how
about
the
stone
at
the
end
of
the
passage
we
will
soon
see
about
that
i
cried
taking
the
lantern
half
the
danger
is
over
at
any
rate
and
the
worst
half
too
we
rushed
along
the
passage
and
up
the
stair
until
we
reached
the
top
why
clinton
i
cried
holding
up
the
lantern
the
place
was
not
shut
at
all
nor
was
it
in
his
terror
he
had
imagined
it
i
could
not
see
in
the
dark
and
i
was
nearly
dead
with
fright
he
said
oh
bell
let
us
get
out
of
this
as
quickly
as
we
can
we
crushed
through
the
aperture
and
once
more
stood
in
the
chapel
i
then
pushed
the
stone
back
into
its
place
dawn
was
just
breaking
when
we
escaped
from
the
chapel
we
hastened
across
to
the
house
in
the
hall
the
clock
pointed
to
five
well
we
have
had
an
awful
time
i
said
as
we
stood
in
the
hall
together
but
at
least
clinton
the
end
was
worth
the
ghastly
terror
i
have
knocked
the
bottom
out
of
your
family
legend
for
ever
i
do
even
now
quite
understand
he
said
do
you
but
it
is
so
easy
that
coffin
never
contained
a
body
at
all
but
was
filled
as
you
perceive
with
fragments
of
magnetic
for
what
diabolical
purposes
the
cell
was
intended
it
is
of
course
impossible
to
say
but
that
it
must
have
been
meant
as
a
human
trap
there
is
little
doubt
the
inventor
certainly
exercised
no
small
ingenuity
when
he
devised
his
diabolical
plot
for
it
was
obvious
that
the
door
which
was
made
of
iron
would
swing
towards
the
coffin
wherever
it
happened
to
be
placed
thus
the
door
would
shut
if
the
coffin
were
the
and
would
remain
open
if
the
coffin
were
a
cleverer
method
for
simulating
a
spiritual
agency
it
would
be
hard
to
find
of
course
the
monk
must
have
known
well
that
magnetic
never
loses
its
quality
and
would
ensure
the
deception
remaining
potent
for
ages
but
how
did
you
discover
by
means
of
our
watches
asked
clinton
any
one
who
understands
magnetism
can
reply
to
that
i
said
it
is
a
fact
that
a
strong
magnet
plays
havoc
with
watches
the
fact
of
both
our
watches
going
wrong
first
gave
me
a
clue
to
the
mystery
later
in
the
day
the
whole
of
this
strange
affair
was
explained
to
miss
curzon
and
not
long
afterwards
the
passage
and
entrance
to
the
chapel
were
bricked
up
it
is
needless
to
add
that
six
months
later
the
pair
were
married
and
i
believe
are
as
happy
as
they
deserve
iii
the
mystery
of
the
felwyn
tunnel
i
was
making
experiments
of
some
interest
at
south
kensington
and
hoped
that
i
had
perfected
a
small
but
not
unimportant
discovery
when
on
returning
home
one
evening
in
late
october
in
the
year
i
found
a
visiting
card
on
my
table
on
it
were
inscribed
the
words
geoffrey
bainbridge
this
name
was
quite
unknown
to
me
so
i
rang
the
bell
and
inquired
of
my
servant
who
the
visitor
had
been
he
described
him
as
a
gentleman
who
wished
to
see
me
on
most
urgent
business
and
said
further
that
bainbridge
intended
to
call
again
later
in
the
evening
it
was
with
both
curiosity
and
vexation
that
i
awaited
the
return
of
the
stranger
urgent
business
with
me
generally
meant
a
hurried
rush
to
one
part
of
the
country
or
the
other
i
did
not
want
to
leave
london
just
then
and
when
at
nine
geoffrey
bainbridge
was
ushered
into
my
room
i
received
him
with
a
certain
coldness
which
he
could
not
fail
to
perceive
he
was
a
tall
elderly
man
he
immediately
plunged
into
the
object
of
his
visit
i
hope
you
do
not
consider
my
unexpected
presence
an
intrusion
bell
he
said
but
i
have
heard
of
you
from
our
mutual
friends
the
greys
of
uplands
you
may
remember
once
doing
that
family
a
great
service
i
remember
perfectly
well
i
answered
more
cordially
pray
tell
me
what
you
want
i
shall
listen
with
attention
i
believe
you
are
the
one
man
in
london
who
can
help
me
he
continued
i
refer
to
a
matter
especially
relating
to
your
own
particular
study
i
need
hardly
say
that
whatever
you
do
will
not
be
unrewarded
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
i
said
but
before
you
go
any
further
allow
me
to
ask
one
question
do
you
want
me
to
leave
london
at
present
he
raised
his
eyebrows
in
dismay
i
certainly
do
he
answered
very
well
pray
proceed
with
your
story
he
looked
at
me
with
anxiety
in
the
first
place
he
began
i
must
tell
you
that
i
am
chairman
of
the
lytton
vale
railway
company
in
wales
and
that
it
is
on
an
important
matter
connected
with
our
line
that
i
have
come
to
consult
you
when
i
explain
to
you
the
nature
of
the
mystery
you
will
not
wonder
i
think
at
my
soliciting
your
aid
i
will
give
you
my
closest
attention
i
answered
and
then
i
added
impelled
to
say
the
latter
words
by
a
certain
expression
on
his
face
if
i
can
see
my
way
to
assisting
you
i
shall
be
ready
to
do
so
pray
accept
my
cordial
thanks
he
replied
i
have
come
up
from
my
place
at
felwyn
on
purpose
to
consult
you
it
is
in
that
neighbourhood
that
the
affair
has
occurred
as
it
is
essential
that
you
should
be
in
possession
of
the
facts
of
the
whole
matter
i
will
go
over
things
just
as
they
happened
i
bent
forward
and
listened
attentively
this
day
fortnight
continued
bainbridge
our
quiet
little
village
was
horrified
by
the
news
that
the
signalman
on
duty
at
the
mouth
of
the
felwyn
tunnel
had
been
found
dead
under
the
most
mysterious
circumstances
the
tunnel
is
at
the
end
of
a
long
cutting
between
llanlys
and
felwyn
stations
it
is
about
a
mile
long
and
the
is
on
the
felwyn
side
the
place
is
extremely
lonely
being
six
miles
from
the
village
across
the
mountains
the
name
of
the
poor
fellow
who
met
his
death
in
this
mysterious
fashion
was
david
pritchard
i
have
known
him
from
a
boy
and
he
was
quite
one
of
the
steadiest
and
most
trustworthy
men
on
the
line
on
tuesday
evening
he
went
on
duty
at
six
on
wednesday
morning
the
who
had
come
to
relieve
him
was
surprised
not
to
find
him
in
the
box
it
was
just
getting
daylight
and
the
local
was
coming
down
so
he
pulled
the
signals
and
let
her
through
then
he
went
out
and
looking
up
the
line
towards
the
tunnel
saw
pritchard
lying
beside
the
line
close
to
the
mouth
of
the
tunnel
roberts
the
ran
up
to
him
and
found
to
his
horror
that
he
was
quite
dead
at
first
roberts
naturally
supposed
that
he
had
been
cut
down
by
a
train
as
there
was
a
wound
at
the
back
of
the
head
but
he
was
not
lying
on
the
metals
roberts
ran
back
to
the
box
and
telegraphed
through
to
felwyn
station
the
message
was
sent
on
to
the
village
and
at
seven
the
police
inspector
came
up
to
my
house
with
the
news
he
and
i
with
the
local
doctor
went
off
at
once
to
the
tunnel
we
found
the
dead
man
lying
beside
the
metals
a
few
yards
away
from
the
mouth
of
the
tunnel
and
the
doctor
immediately
gave
him
a
careful
examination
there
was
a
depressed
fracture
at
the
back
of
the
skull
which
must
have
caused
his
death
but
how
he
came
by
it
was
not
so
clear
on
examining
the
whole
place
most
carefully
we
saw
further
that
there
were
marks
on
the
rocks
at
the
steep
side
of
the
embankment
as
if
some
one
had
tried
to
scramble
up
them
why
the
poor
fellow
had
attempted
such
a
climb
god
only
knows
in
doing
so
he
must
have
slipped
and
fallen
back
on
to
the
line
thus
causing
the
fracture
of
the
skull
in
no
case
could
he
have
gone
up
more
than
eight
or
ten
feet
as
the
banks
of
the
cutting
run
sheer
up
almost
perpendicularly
beyond
that
point
for
more
than
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
there
are
some
sharp
boulders
beside
the
line
and
it
was
possible
that
he
might
have
fallen
on
one
of
these
and
so
sustained
the
injury
the
affair
must
have
occurred
some
time
between
and
as
the
of
the
express
at
states
that
the
line
was
signalled
clear
and
he
also
caught
sight
of
pritchard
in
his
box
as
he
passed
this
is
deeply
interesting
i
said
pray
proceed
bainbridge
looked
at
me
earnestly
he
then
continued
the
whole
thing
is
shrouded
in
mystery
why
should
pritchard
have
left
his
box
and
gone
down
to
the
tunnel
why
having
done
so
should
he
have
made
a
wild
attempt
to
scale
the
side
of
the
cutting
an
impossible
feat
at
any
time
had
danger
threatened
the
ordinary
course
of
things
would
have
been
to
run
up
the
line
towards
the
these
points
are
quite
unexplained
another
curious
fact
is
that
death
appears
to
have
taken
place
just
before
the
came
on
duty
as
the
light
at
the
mouth
of
the
tunnel
had
been
put
out
and
it
was
one
of
the
night
signalman
duties
to
do
this
as
soon
as
daylight
appeared
it
is
possible
therefore
that
pritchard
went
down
to
the
tunnel
for
that
purpose
against
this
theory
however
and
an
objection
that
seems
to
nullify
it
is
the
evidence
of
williams
who
states
that
when
he
examined
the
body
his
opinion
was
that
death
had
taken
place
some
hours
before
an
inquest
was
held
on
the
following
day
but
before
it
took
place
there
was
a
new
and
most
important
development
i
now
come
to
what
i
consider
the
crucial
point
in
the
whole
story
for
a
long
time
there
had
been
a
feud
between
pritchard
and
another
man
of
the
name
of
wynne
a
platelayer
on
the
line
the
object
of
their
quarrel
was
the
blacksmith
daughter
in
the
neighbouring
village
a
remarkably
pretty
girl
and
an
arrant
flirt
both
men
were
madly
in
love
with
her
and
she
played
them
off
one
against
the
other
the
night
but
one
before
his
death
pritchard
and
wynne
had
met
at
the
village
inn
had
quarrelled
in
the
bar
lucy
of
course
being
the
subject
of
their
difference
wynne
was
heard
to
say
he
was
a
man
of
powerful
build
and
subject
to
fits
of
ungovernable
rage
that
he
would
have
life
pritchard
swore
a
great
oath
that
he
would
get
lucy
on
the
following
day
to
promise
to
marry
him
this
oath
it
appears
he
kept
and
on
his
way
to
the
on
tuesday
evening
met
wynne
and
triumphantly
told
him
that
lucy
had
promised
to
be
his
wife
the
men
had
a
fight
on
the
spot
several
people
from
the
village
being
witnesses
of
it
they
were
separated
with
difficulty
each
vowing
vengeance
on
the
other
pritchard
went
off
to
his
duty
at
the
and
wynne
returned
to
the
village
to
drown
his
sorrows
at
the
very
late
that
same
night
wynne
was
seen
by
a
villager
going
in
the
direction
of
the
tunnel
the
man
stopped
him
and
questioned
him
he
explained
that
he
had
left
some
of
his
tools
on
the
line
and
was
on
his
way
to
fetch
them
the
villager
noticed
that
he
looked
queer
and
excited
but
not
wishing
to
pick
a
quarrel
thought
it
best
not
to
question
him
further
it
has
been
proved
that
wynne
never
returned
home
that
night
but
came
back
at
an
early
hour
on
the
following
morning
looking
dazed
and
stupid
he
was
arrested
on
suspicion
and
at
the
inquest
the
verdict
was
against
him
has
he
given
any
explanation
of
his
own
movements
i
asked
yes
but
nothing
that
can
clear
him
as
a
matter
of
fact
his
tools
were
nowhere
to
be
seen
on
the
line
nor
did
he
bring
them
home
with
him
his
own
story
is
that
being
considerably
the
worse
for
drink
he
had
fallen
down
in
one
of
the
fields
and
slept
there
till
morning
things
look
black
against
him
i
said
they
do
but
listen
i
have
something
more
to
add
here
comes
a
very
queer
feature
in
the
affair
lucy
ray
the
girl
who
had
caused
the
feud
between
pritchard
and
wynne
after
hearing
the
news
of
death
completely
lost
her
head
and
ran
frantically
about
the
village
declaring
that
wynne
was
the
man
she
really
loved
and
that
she
had
only
accepted
pritchard
in
a
fit
of
rage
with
wynne
for
not
himself
bringing
matters
to
the
point
the
case
looks
very
bad
against
wynne
and
yesterday
the
magistrate
committed
him
for
trial
at
the
coming
assizes
the
unhappy
lucy
ray
and
the
young
man
parents
are
in
a
state
bordering
on
distraction
what
is
your
own
opinion
with
regard
to
wynne
guilt
i
asked
before
god
bell
i
believe
the
poor
fellow
is
innocent
but
the
evidence
against
him
is
very
strong
one
of
the
favourite
theories
is
that
he
went
down
to
the
tunnel
and
extinguished
the
light
knowing
that
this
would
bring
pritchard
out
of
his
box
to
see
what
was
the
matter
and
that
he
then
attacked
him
striking
the
blow
which
fractured
the
skull
has
any
weapon
been
found
about
with
which
he
could
have
given
such
a
blow
no
nor
has
anything
of
the
kind
been
discovered
on
wynne
person
that
fact
is
decidedly
in
his
favour
but
what
about
the
marks
on
the
rocks
i
asked
it
is
possible
that
wynne
may
have
made
them
in
order
to
divert
suspicion
by
making
people
think
that
pritchard
must
have
fallen
and
so
killed
himself
the
holders
of
this
theory
base
their
belief
on
the
absolute
want
of
cause
for
pritchard
trying
to
scale
the
rock
the
whole
thing
is
the
most
absolute
enigma
some
of
the
country
folk
have
declared
that
the
tunnel
is
haunted
and
there
certainly
has
been
such
a
rumour
current
among
them
for
years
that
pritchard
saw
some
apparition
and
in
wild
terror
sought
to
escape
from
it
by
climbing
the
rocks
is
another
theory
but
only
the
most
imaginative
hold
it
well
it
is
a
most
extraordinary
case
i
replied
yes
bell
and
i
should
like
to
get
your
opinion
of
it
do
you
see
your
way
to
elucidate
the
mystery
not
at
present
but
i
shall
be
happy
to
investigate
the
matter
to
my
utmost
ability
but
you
do
not
wish
to
leave
london
at
present
that
is
so
but
a
matter
of
such
importance
can
not
be
set
aside
it
appears
from
what
you
say
that
wynne
life
hangs
more
or
less
on
my
being
able
to
clear
away
the
mystery
that
is
indeed
the
case
there
ought
not
to
be
a
single
stone
left
unturned
to
get
at
the
truth
for
the
sake
of
wynne
well
bell
what
do
you
propose
to
do
to
see
the
place
without
delay
i
answered
that
is
right
when
can
you
come
whenever
you
please
will
you
come
down
to
felwyn
with
me
i
shall
leave
paddington
by
the
and
if
you
will
be
my
guest
i
shall
be
only
too
pleased
to
put
you
up
that
arrangement
will
suit
me
admirably
i
replied
i
will
meet
you
by
the
train
you
mention
and
the
affair
shall
have
my
best
attention
thank
you
he
said
rising
he
shook
hands
with
me
and
took
his
leave
the
next
day
i
met
bainbridge
at
paddington
station
and
we
were
soon
flying
westward
in
the
luxurious
private
compartment
that
had
been
reserved
for
him
i
could
see
by
his
abstracted
manner
and
his
long
lapses
of
silence
that
the
mysterious
affair
at
felwyn
tunnel
was
occupying
all
his
thoughts
it
was
two
in
the
afternoon
when
the
train
slowed
down
at
the
little
station
of
felwyn
the
was
at
the
door
in
an
instant
to
receive
us
i
have
some
terribly
bad
news
for
you
sir
he
said
turning
to
bainbridge
as
we
alighted
and
yet
in
one
sense
it
is
a
relief
for
it
seems
to
clear
wynne
what
do
you
mean
cried
bainbridge
bad
news
speak
out
at
once
well
sir
it
is
this
there
has
been
another
death
at
felwyn
john
davidson
who
was
on
duty
last
night
was
found
dead
at
an
early
hour
this
morning
in
the
very
same
place
where
we
found
poor
pritchard
good
god
cried
bainbridge
starting
back
what
an
awful
thing
what
in
the
name
of
heaven
does
it
mean
bell
this
is
too
fearful
thank
goodness
you
have
come
down
with
us
it
is
as
black
a
business
as
i
ever
heard
of
sir
echoed
the
and
what
we
are
to
do
i
do
know
poor
davidson
was
found
dead
this
morning
and
there
was
neither
mark
nor
sign
of
what
killed
him
that
is
the
extraordinary
part
of
it
there
a
perfect
panic
abroad
and
not
a
signalman
on
the
line
will
take
duty
i
was
quite
in
despair
and
was
afraid
at
one
time
that
the
line
would
have
to
be
closed
but
at
last
it
occurred
to
me
to
wire
to
lytton
vale
and
they
are
sending
down
an
inspector
i
expect
him
by
a
special
every
moment
i
believe
this
is
he
coming
now
added
the
looking
up
the
line
there
was
the
sound
of
a
whistle
down
the
valley
and
in
a
few
moments
a
single
engine
shot
into
the
station
and
an
official
in
uniform
stepped
on
to
the
platform
sir
he
said
touching
his
cap
to
bainbridge
i
have
just
been
sent
down
to
inquire
into
this
affair
at
the
felwyn
tunnel
and
though
it
seems
more
of
a
matter
for
a
scotland
yard
detective
than
one
of
ourselves
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
come
all
the
same
bainbridge
i
can
not
say
that
i
look
forward
to
spending
alone
at
the
place
you
wish
for
the
services
of
a
detective
but
you
shall
have
some
one
better
said
bainbridge
turning
towards
me
this
gentleman
john
bell
is
the
man
of
all
others
for
our
business
i
have
just
brought
him
down
from
london
for
the
purpose
an
expression
of
relief
flitted
across
the
inspector
face
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
sir
he
said
to
me
and
i
hope
you
will
be
able
to
spend
the
night
with
me
in
the
i
must
say
i
much
relish
the
idea
of
tackling
the
thing
but
with
your
help
sir
i
think
we
ought
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
it
somehow
i
am
afraid
there
is
not
a
man
on
the
line
who
will
take
duty
until
we
do
so
it
is
most
important
that
the
thing
should
be
cleared
and
without
delay
i
readily
assented
to
the
inspector
proposition
and
bainbridge
and
i
arranged
that
we
should
call
for
him
at
four
at
the
village
inn
and
drive
him
to
the
tunnel
we
then
stepped
into
the
wagonette
which
was
waiting
for
us
and
drove
to
bainbridge
house
bainbridge
came
out
to
meet
us
and
was
full
of
the
tragedy
two
pretty
girls
also
ran
to
greet
their
father
and
to
glance
inquisitively
at
me
i
could
see
that
the
entire
family
was
in
a
state
of
much
excitement
lucy
ray
has
just
left
father
said
the
elder
of
the
girls
we
had
much
trouble
to
soothe
her
she
is
in
a
frantic
state
you
have
heard
bell
all
about
this
dreadful
mystery
said
bainbridge
as
she
led
me
towards
the
yes
i
answered
your
husband
has
been
good
enough
to
give
me
every
particular
and
you
have
really
come
here
to
help
us
i
hope
i
may
be
able
to
discover
the
cause
i
answered
it
certainly
seems
most
extraordinary
continued
bainbridge
my
dear
she
continued
turning
to
her
husband
you
can
easily
imagine
the
state
we
were
all
in
this
morning
when
the
news
of
the
second
death
was
brought
to
us
for
my
part
said
ella
bainbridge
i
am
sure
that
felwyn
tunnel
is
haunted
the
villagers
have
thought
so
for
a
long
time
and
this
second
death
seems
to
prove
it
does
it
not
here
she
looked
anxiously
at
me
i
can
offer
no
opinion
i
replied
until
i
have
sifted
the
matter
thoroughly
come
ella
do
worry
bell
said
her
father
if
he
is
as
hungry
as
i
am
he
must
want
his
lunch
we
then
seated
ourselves
at
the
table
and
commenced
the
meal
bainbridge
although
he
professed
to
be
hungry
was
in
such
a
state
of
excitement
that
he
could
scarcely
eat
immediately
after
lunch
he
left
me
to
the
care
of
his
family
and
went
into
the
village
it
is
just
like
him
said
bainbridge
he
takes
these
sort
of
things
to
heart
dreadfully
he
is
terribly
upset
about
lucy
ray
and
also
about
the
poor
fellow
wynne
it
is
certainly
a
fearful
tragedy
from
first
to
last
well
at
any
rate
i
said
this
fresh
death
will
upset
the
evidence
against
wynne
i
hope
so
and
there
is
some
satisfaction
in
the
fact
well
bell
i
see
you
have
finished
lunch
will
you
come
into
the
i
followed
her
into
a
pleasant
room
overlooking
the
valley
of
the
lytton
bainbridge
returned
and
soon
afterwards
the
came
to
the
door
my
host
and
i
mounted
bainbridge
took
the
reins
and
we
started
off
at
a
brisk
pace
matters
get
worse
and
worse
he
said
the
moment
we
were
alone
if
you
do
clear
things
up
bell
i
say
frankly
that
i
can
not
imagine
what
will
happen
we
entered
the
village
and
as
we
rattled
down
the
streets
i
was
greeted
with
curious
glances
on
all
sides
the
people
were
standing
about
in
groups
evidently
talking
about
the
tragedy
and
nothing
else
suddenly
as
our
trap
bumped
noisily
over
the
a
girl
darted
out
of
one
of
the
houses
and
made
frantic
motions
to
bainbridge
to
stop
the
horse
he
pulled
the
mare
nearly
up
on
her
haunches
and
the
girl
came
up
to
the
side
of
the
you
have
heard
it
she
said
speaking
eagerly
and
in
a
gasping
voice
the
death
which
occurred
this
morning
will
clear
stephen
wynne
it
mr
bainbridge
it
will
you
are
sure
are
you
not
it
looks
like
it
lucy
my
poor
girl
he
answered
but
there
the
whole
thing
is
so
terrible
that
i
scarcely
know
what
to
think
she
was
a
pretty
girl
with
dark
eyes
and
under
ordinary
circumstances
must
have
had
the
vivacious
expression
of
face
and
the
brilliant
complexion
which
so
many
of
her
countrywomen
possess
but
now
her
eyes
were
swollen
with
weeping
and
her
complexion
more
or
less
disfigured
by
the
agony
she
had
gone
through
she
looked
piteously
at
bainbridge
her
lips
trembling
the
next
moment
she
burst
into
tears
come
away
lucy
said
a
woman
who
had
followed
her
out
of
the
cottage
fie
for
shame
do
trouble
the
gentlemen
come
back
and
stay
quiet
i
ca
mother
i
ca
said
the
unfortunate
girl
if
they
hang
him
i
go
clean
off
my
head
oh
bainbridge
do
say
that
the
second
death
has
cleared
him
i
have
every
hope
that
it
will
do
so
lucy
said
bainbridge
but
now
do
keep
us
there
a
good
girl
go
back
into
the
house
this
gentleman
has
come
down
from
london
on
purpose
to
look
into
the
whole
matter
i
may
have
good
news
for
you
in
the
morning
the
girl
raised
her
eyes
to
my
face
with
a
look
of
intense
pleading
oh
i
have
been
cruel
and
a
fool
and
i
deserve
everything
she
gasped
but
sir
for
the
love
of
heaven
try
to
clear
him
i
promised
to
do
my
best
bainbridge
touched
up
the
mare
she
bounded
forward
and
lucy
disappeared
into
the
cottage
with
her
mother
the
next
moment
we
drew
up
at
the
inn
where
the
inspector
was
waiting
and
soon
afterwards
were
bowling
along
between
the
high
banks
of
the
country
lanes
to
the
tunnel
it
was
a
cold
still
afternoon
the
air
was
wonderfully
keen
for
a
sharp
frost
had
held
the
countryside
in
its
grip
for
the
last
two
days
the
sun
was
just
tipping
the
hills
to
westward
when
the
trap
pulled
up
at
the
top
of
the
cutting
we
hastily
alighted
and
the
inspector
and
i
bade
bainbridge
he
said
that
he
only
wished
that
he
could
stay
with
us
for
the
night
assured
us
that
little
sleep
would
visit
him
and
that
he
would
be
back
at
the
cutting
at
an
early
hour
on
the
following
morning
then
the
noise
of
his
horse
feet
was
heard
fainter
and
fainter
as
he
drove
back
over
the
roads
the
inspector
and
i
ran
along
the
little
path
to
the
in
the
fence
stamping
our
feet
on
the
hard
ground
to
restore
circulation
after
our
cold
drive
the
next
moment
we
were
looking
down
upon
the
scene
of
the
mysterious
deaths
and
a
weird
and
lonely
place
it
looked
the
tunnel
was
at
one
end
of
the
rock
cutting
the
sides
of
which
ran
sheer
down
to
the
line
for
over
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
above
the
tunnel
mouth
the
hills
rose
one
upon
the
other
a
more
dreary
place
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
imagine
from
a
little
clump
of
pines
a
delicate
film
of
blue
smoke
rose
straight
up
on
the
still
air
this
came
from
the
chimney
of
the
as
we
started
to
descend
the
precipitous
path
the
inspector
sang
out
a
cheery
hullo
the
man
on
duty
in
the
box
immediately
answered
his
voice
echoed
and
reverberated
down
the
cutting
and
the
next
moment
he
appeared
at
the
door
of
the
box
he
told
us
that
he
would
be
with
us
immediately
but
we
called
back
to
him
to
stay
where
he
was
and
the
next
instant
the
inspector
and
i
entered
the
box
the
first
thing
to
do
said
henderson
the
inspector
is
to
send
a
message
down
the
line
to
announce
our
arrival
this
he
did
and
in
a
few
moments
a
crawling
goods
train
came
panting
up
the
cutting
after
signalling
her
through
we
descended
the
wooden
flight
of
steps
which
led
from
the
box
down
to
the
line
and
walked
along
the
metals
towards
the
tunnel
till
we
stood
on
the
spot
where
poor
davidson
had
been
found
dead
that
morning
i
examined
the
ground
and
all
around
it
most
carefully
everything
tallied
exactly
with
the
description
i
had
received
there
could
be
no
possible
way
of
approaching
the
spot
except
by
going
along
the
line
as
the
rocky
sides
of
the
cutting
were
inaccessible
it
is
a
most
extraordinary
thing
sir
said
the
signalman
whom
we
had
come
to
relieve
davidson
had
neither
mark
nor
sign
on
him
there
he
lay
stone
dead
and
cold
and
not
a
bruise
nowhere
but
pritchard
had
an
awful
wound
at
the
back
of
the
head
they
said
he
got
it
by
climbing
the
rocks
here
you
can
see
the
marks
for
yourself
sir
but
now
is
it
likely
that
pritchard
would
try
to
climb
rocks
like
these
so
steep
as
they
are
certainly
not
i
replied
then
how
do
you
account
for
the
wound
sir
asked
the
man
with
an
anxious
face
i
can
not
tell
you
at
present
i
answered
and
you
and
inspector
henderson
are
going
to
spend
the
night
in
the
yes
a
horrified
expression
crept
over
the
signalman
face
god
preserve
you
both
he
said
i
would
do
it
not
for
fifty
pounds
it
not
the
first
time
i
have
heard
tell
that
felwyn
tunnel
is
haunted
but
there
i
wo
say
any
more
about
that
it
a
black
business
and
has
given
trouble
enough
there
poor
wynne
the
same
thing
as
convicted
of
the
murder
of
pritchard
but
now
they
say
that
davidson
death
will
clear
him
davidson
was
as
good
a
fellow
as
you
would
come
across
this
side
of
the
country
but
for
the
matter
of
that
so
was
pritchard
the
whole
thing
is
terrible
it
upsets
one
that
it
do
sir
i
do
wonder
at
your
feelings
i
answered
but
now
see
here
i
want
to
make
a
most
careful
examination
of
everything
one
of
the
theories
is
that
wynne
crept
down
this
rocky
side
and
fractured
pritchard
skull
i
believe
such
a
feat
to
be
impossible
on
examining
these
rocks
i
see
that
a
man
might
climb
up
the
side
of
the
tunnel
as
far
as
from
eight
to
ten
feet
utilising
the
sharp
projections
of
rock
for
the
purpose
but
it
would
be
out
of
the
question
for
any
man
to
come
down
the
cutting
no
the
only
way
wynne
could
have
approached
pritchard
was
by
the
line
itself
but
after
all
the
real
thing
to
discover
is
this
i
continued
what
killed
davidson
whatever
caused
his
death
is
beyond
doubt
equally
responsible
for
pritchard
i
am
now
going
into
the
tunnel
inspector
henderson
went
in
with
me
the
place
struck
damp
and
chill
the
walls
were
covered
with
green
fungi
and
through
the
brickwork
the
moisture
was
oozing
and
had
trickled
down
in
long
lines
to
the
ground
before
us
was
nothing
but
dense
darkness
when
we
the
signalman
was
lighting
the
red
lamp
on
the
post
which
stood
about
five
feet
from
the
ground
just
above
the
entrance
to
the
tunnel
is
there
plenty
of
oil
asked
the
inspector
yes
sir
plenty
replied
the
man
is
there
anything
more
i
can
do
for
either
of
you
gentlemen
he
asked
pausing
and
evidently
dying
to
be
off
nothing
answered
henderson
i
will
wish
you
to
you
both
said
the
man
he
made
his
way
quickly
up
the
path
and
was
soon
lost
to
sight
henderson
and
i
then
returned
to
the
by
this
time
it
was
nearly
dark
how
many
trains
pass
in
the
night
i
asked
of
the
inspector
there
the
down
express
he
said
it
will
pass
here
at
about
then
there
the
up
and
then
not
another
train
till
the
local
morning
we
sha
have
a
very
lively
time
he
added
i
approached
the
fire
and
bent
over
it
holding
out
my
hands
to
try
and
get
some
warmth
into
them
it
will
take
a
good
deal
to
persuade
me
to
go
down
to
the
tunnel
whatever
i
may
see
there
said
the
man
i
do
think
bell
i
am
a
coward
in
any
sense
of
the
word
but
there
something
very
uncanny
about
this
place
right
away
from
the
rest
of
the
world
i
do
wonder
one
often
hears
of
signalmen
going
mad
in
some
of
these
lonely
boxes
have
you
any
theory
to
account
for
these
deaths
sir
none
at
present
i
replied
this
second
death
puts
the
idea
of
pritchard
being
murdered
quite
out
of
court
he
continued
i
am
sure
of
it
i
answered
and
so
am
i
and
that
one
comfort
continued
henderson
that
poor
girl
lucy
ray
although
she
was
to
be
blamed
for
her
conduct
is
much
to
be
pitied
now
and
as
to
poor
wynne
himself
he
protests
his
innocence
through
thick
and
thin
he
was
a
wild
fellow
but
not
the
sort
to
take
the
life
of
a
i
saw
the
doctor
this
afternoon
while
i
was
waiting
for
you
at
the
inn
bell
and
also
the
police
sergeant
they
both
say
they
do
not
know
what
davidson
died
of
there
was
not
the
least
sign
of
violence
on
the
body
well
i
am
as
puzzled
as
the
rest
of
you
i
said
i
have
one
or
two
theories
in
my
mind
but
none
of
them
will
quite
fit
the
situation
the
night
was
piercingly
cold
and
although
there
was
not
a
breath
of
wind
the
keen
and
frosty
air
penetrated
into
the
lonely
we
spoke
little
and
both
of
us
were
doubtless
absorbed
by
our
own
thoughts
and
speculations
as
to
henderson
he
looked
distinctly
uncomfortable
and
i
can
not
say
that
my
own
feelings
were
too
pleasant
never
had
i
been
given
a
tougher
problem
to
solve
and
never
had
i
been
so
utterly
at
my
wits
end
for
a
solution
now
and
then
the
inspector
got
up
and
went
to
the
telegraph
instrument
which
intermittently
clicked
away
in
its
box
as
he
did
so
he
made
some
casual
remark
and
then
sat
down
again
after
the
had
gone
through
there
followed
a
period
of
silence
which
seemed
almost
oppressive
all
at
once
the
stillness
was
broken
by
the
whirr
of
the
electric
bell
which
sounded
so
sharply
in
our
ears
that
we
both
started
henderson
rose
that
the
coming
he
said
and
going
over
to
the
three
long
levers
he
pulled
two
of
them
down
with
a
loud
clang
the
next
moment
with
a
rush
and
a
scream
the
express
tore
down
the
cutting
the
carriage
lights
streamed
past
in
a
rapid
flash
the
ground
trembled
a
few
sparks
from
the
engine
whirled
up
into
the
darkness
and
the
train
plunged
into
the
tunnel
and
now
said
henderson
as
he
pushed
back
the
levers
not
another
train
till
daylight
my
word
it
is
cold
it
was
intensely
so
i
piled
some
more
wood
on
the
fire
and
turning
up
the
collar
of
my
heavy
ulster
sat
down
at
one
end
of
the
bench
and
leant
my
back
against
the
wall
henderson
did
likewise
we
were
neither
of
us
inclined
to
speak
as
a
rule
whenever
i
have
any
night
work
to
do
i
am
never
troubled
with
sleepiness
but
on
this
occasion
i
felt
unaccountably
drowsy
i
soon
perceived
that
henderson
was
in
the
same
condition
are
you
sleepy
i
asked
of
him
dead
with
it
sir
was
his
answer
but
there
no
fear
i
wo
drop
off
i
got
up
and
went
to
the
window
of
the
box
i
felt
certain
that
if
i
sat
still
any
longer
i
should
be
in
a
sound
sleep
this
would
never
do
already
it
was
becoming
a
matter
of
torture
to
keep
my
eyes
open
i
began
to
pace
up
and
down
i
opened
the
door
of
the
box
and
went
out
on
the
little
platform
what
the
matter
sir
inquired
henderson
jumping
up
with
a
start
i
can
not
keep
awake
i
said
nor
can
i
he
answered
and
yet
i
have
spent
nights
and
nights
of
my
life
in
and
never
was
the
least
bit
drowsy
perhaps
the
cold
perhaps
it
is
i
said
but
i
have
been
out
on
as
freezing
nights
before
and
the
man
did
not
reply
he
had
sat
down
again
his
head
was
nodding
i
was
just
about
to
go
up
to
him
and
shake
him
when
it
suddenly
occurred
to
me
that
i
might
as
well
let
him
have
his
sleep
out
i
soon
heard
him
snoring
and
he
presently
fell
forward
in
a
heap
on
the
floor
by
dint
of
walking
up
and
down
i
managed
to
keep
from
dropping
off
myself
and
in
torture
which
i
shall
never
be
able
to
describe
the
night
wore
itself
away
at
last
towards
morning
i
awoke
henderson
you
have
had
a
good
nap
i
said
but
never
mind
i
have
been
on
guard
and
nothing
has
occurred
good
god
have
i
been
asleep
cried
the
man
sound
i
answered
well
i
never
felt
anything
like
it
he
replied
do
you
find
the
air
very
close
sir
no
i
said
it
is
as
fresh
as
possible
it
must
be
the
cold
i
just
go
and
have
a
look
at
the
light
at
the
tunnel
said
the
man
it
will
rouse
me
he
went
on
to
the
little
platform
whilst
i
bent
over
the
fire
and
began
to
build
it
up
presently
he
returned
with
a
scared
look
on
his
face
i
could
see
by
the
light
of
the
oil
lamp
which
hung
on
the
wall
that
he
was
trembling
bell
he
said
i
believe
there
is
somebody
or
something
down
at
the
mouth
of
the
tunnel
now
as
he
spoke
he
clutched
me
by
the
arm
go
and
look
he
said
whoever
it
is
it
has
put
out
the
light
put
out
the
light
i
cried
why
what
the
time
henderson
pulled
out
his
watch
thank
goodness
most
of
the
night
is
gone
he
said
i
did
know
it
was
so
late
it
is
five
then
the
local
is
not
due
for
an
hour
yet
i
said
no
but
who
should
put
out
the
light
cried
henderson
i
went
to
the
door
flung
it
open
and
looked
out
the
dim
outline
of
the
tunnel
was
just
visible
looming
through
the
darkness
but
the
red
light
was
out
what
the
dickens
does
it
mean
sir
gasped
the
inspector
i
know
the
lamp
had
plenty
of
oil
in
it
can
there
be
any
one
standing
in
front
of
it
do
you
think
we
waited
and
watched
for
a
few
moments
but
nothing
stirred
come
along
i
said
let
us
go
down
together
and
see
what
it
is
i
do
believe
i
can
do
it
sir
i
really
do
nonsense
i
cried
i
shall
go
down
alone
if
you
wo
accompany
me
just
hand
me
my
stick
will
you
for
god
sake
be
careful
bell
do
go
down
whatever
you
do
i
expect
this
is
what
happened
before
and
the
poor
fellows
went
down
to
see
what
it
was
and
died
there
there
some
devilry
at
work
that
my
belief
that
is
as
it
may
be
i
answered
shortly
but
we
certainly
shall
not
find
out
by
stopping
here
my
business
is
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
and
i
am
going
to
do
it
that
there
is
danger
of
some
sort
i
have
very
little
doubt
but
danger
or
not
i
am
going
down
if
you
be
warned
by
me
sir
you
just
stay
quietly
here
i
must
go
down
and
see
the
matter
out
was
my
answer
now
listen
to
me
henderson
i
see
that
you
are
alarmed
and
i
do
wonder
just
stay
quietly
where
you
are
and
watch
but
if
i
call
come
at
once
do
delay
a
single
instant
remember
i
am
putting
my
life
into
your
hands
if
i
call
just
come
to
me
as
quick
as
you
can
for
i
may
want
help
give
me
that
lantern
he
unhitched
it
from
the
wall
and
taking
it
from
him
i
walked
cautiously
down
the
steps
on
to
the
line
i
still
felt
curiously
unaccountably
drowsy
and
heavy
i
wondered
at
this
for
the
moment
was
such
a
critical
one
as
to
make
almost
any
man
wide
awake
holding
the
lamp
high
above
my
head
i
walked
rapidly
along
the
line
i
hardly
knew
what
i
expected
to
find
cautiously
along
the
metals
i
made
my
way
peering
right
and
left
until
i
was
close
to
the
fatal
spot
where
the
bodies
had
been
found
an
uncontrollable
shudder
passed
over
me
the
next
moment
to
my
horror
without
the
slightest
warning
the
light
i
was
carrying
went
out
leaving
me
in
total
darkness
i
started
back
and
stumbling
against
one
of
the
loose
boulders
reeled
against
the
wall
and
nearly
fell
what
was
the
matter
with
me
i
could
hardly
stand
i
felt
giddy
and
faint
and
a
horrible
sensation
of
great
tightness
seized
me
across
the
chest
a
loud
ringing
noise
sounded
in
my
ears
struggling
madly
for
breath
and
with
the
fear
of
impending
death
upon
me
i
turned
and
tried
to
run
from
a
danger
i
could
neither
understand
nor
grapple
with
but
before
i
had
taken
two
steps
my
legs
gave
way
from
under
me
and
uttering
a
loud
cry
i
fell
insensible
to
the
ground
out
of
an
oblivion
which
for
all
i
knew
might
have
lasted
for
moments
or
centuries
a
dawning
consciousness
came
to
me
i
knew
that
i
was
lying
on
hard
ground
that
i
was
absolutely
incapable
of
realising
nor
had
i
the
slightest
inclination
to
discover
where
i
was
all
i
wanted
was
to
lie
quite
still
and
undisturbed
presently
i
opened
my
eyes
some
one
was
bending
over
me
and
looking
into
my
face
thank
god
he
is
not
dead
i
heard
in
whispered
tones
then
with
a
flash
memory
returned
to
me
what
has
happened
i
asked
you
may
well
ask
that
sir
said
the
inspector
gravely
it
has
been
touch
and
go
with
you
for
the
last
quarter
of
an
hour
and
a
near
thing
for
me
too
i
sat
up
and
looked
around
me
daylight
was
just
beginning
to
break
and
i
saw
that
we
were
at
the
bottom
of
the
steps
that
led
up
to
the
my
teeth
were
chattering
with
the
cold
and
i
was
shivering
like
a
man
with
ague
i
am
better
now
i
said
just
give
me
your
hand
i
took
his
arm
and
holding
the
rail
with
the
other
hand
staggered
up
into
the
box
and
sat
down
on
the
bench
yes
it
has
been
a
near
shave
i
said
and
a
big
price
to
pay
for
solving
a
mystery
do
you
mean
to
say
you
know
what
it
is
asked
henderson
eagerly
yes
i
answered
i
think
i
know
now
but
first
tell
me
how
long
was
i
unconscious
a
good
bit
over
half
an
hour
sir
i
should
think
as
soon
as
i
heard
you
call
out
i
ran
down
as
you
told
me
but
before
i
got
to
you
i
nearly
fainted
i
never
had
such
a
horrible
sensation
in
my
life
i
felt
as
weak
as
a
baby
but
i
just
managed
to
seize
you
by
the
arms
and
drag
you
along
the
line
to
the
steps
and
that
was
about
all
i
could
do
well
i
owe
you
my
life
i
said
just
hand
me
that
brandy
flask
i
shall
be
the
better
for
some
of
its
contents
i
took
a
long
pull
just
as
i
was
laying
the
flask
down
henderson
started
from
my
side
there
he
cried
the
is
coming
the
electric
bell
at
the
instrument
suddenly
began
to
ring
ought
i
to
let
her
go
through
sir
he
inquired
certainly
i
answered
that
is
exactly
what
we
want
oh
she
will
be
all
right
no
danger
to
her
sir
none
none
let
her
go
through
he
pulled
the
lever
and
the
next
moment
the
train
tore
through
the
cutting
now
i
think
it
will
be
safe
to
go
down
again
i
said
i
believe
i
shall
be
able
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
business
henderson
stared
at
me
aghast
do
you
mean
that
you
are
going
down
again
to
the
tunnel
he
gasped
yes
i
said
give
me
those
matches
you
had
better
come
too
i
think
there
will
be
much
danger
now
and
there
is
daylight
so
we
can
see
what
we
are
about
the
man
was
very
loth
to
obey
me
but
at
last
i
managed
to
persuade
him
we
went
down
the
line
walking
slowly
and
at
this
moment
we
both
felt
our
courage
revived
by
a
broad
and
cheerful
ray
of
sunshine
we
must
advance
cautiously
i
said
and
be
ready
to
run
back
at
a
moment
notice
god
knows
sir
i
think
we
are
running
a
great
risk
panted
poor
henderson
and
if
that
devil
or
whatever
else
it
is
should
happen
to
be
about
why
daylight
or
no
daylight
nonsense
man
i
interrupted
if
we
are
careful
no
harm
will
happen
to
us
now
ah
and
here
we
are
we
had
reached
the
spot
where
i
had
fallen
just
give
me
a
match
henderson
he
did
so
and
i
immediately
lit
the
lamp
opening
the
glass
of
the
lamp
i
held
it
close
to
the
ground
and
passed
it
to
and
fro
suddenly
the
flame
went
out
do
you
understand
now
i
said
looking
up
at
the
inspector
no
i
do
sir
he
replied
with
a
bewildered
expression
suddenly
before
i
could
make
an
explanation
we
both
heard
shouts
from
the
top
of
the
cutting
and
looking
up
i
saw
bainbridge
hurrying
down
the
path
he
had
come
in
the
to
fetch
us
here
the
mystery
i
cried
as
he
rushed
up
to
us
and
a
deadlier
scheme
of
dame
nature
to
frighten
and
murder
poor
humanity
i
have
never
seen
as
i
spoke
i
lit
the
lamp
again
and
held
it
just
above
a
tiny
fissure
in
the
rock
it
was
at
once
extinguished
what
is
it
said
bainbridge
panting
with
excitement
something
that
nearly
finished
i
replied
why
this
is
a
natural
escape
of
choke
damp
carbonic
acid
gas
the
deadliest
gas
imaginable
because
it
gives
no
warning
of
its
presence
and
it
has
no
smell
it
must
have
collected
here
during
the
hours
of
the
night
when
no
train
was
passing
and
gradually
rising
put
out
the
signal
light
the
constant
rushing
of
the
trains
through
the
cutting
all
day
would
temporarily
disperse
it
as
i
made
this
explanation
bainbridge
stood
like
one
electrified
while
a
curious
expression
of
mingled
relief
and
horror
swept
over
face
an
escape
of
carbonic
acid
gas
is
not
an
uncommon
phenomenon
in
volcanic
districts
i
continued
as
i
take
this
to
be
but
it
is
odd
what
should
have
started
it
it
has
sometimes
been
known
to
follow
earthquake
shocks
when
there
is
a
profound
disturbance
of
the
deep
strata
it
is
strange
that
you
should
have
said
that
said
bainbridge
when
he
could
find
his
voice
what
do
you
mean
why
that
about
the
earthquake
do
you
remember
henderson
he
added
turning
to
the
inspector
we
had
felt
a
slight
shock
all
over
south
wales
about
three
weeks
back
then
that
i
think
explains
it
i
said
it
is
evident
that
pritchard
really
did
climb
the
rocks
in
a
frantic
attempt
to
escape
from
the
gas
and
fell
back
on
to
these
boulders
the
other
man
was
cut
down
at
once
before
he
had
time
to
fly
but
what
is
to
happen
now
asked
bainbridge
will
it
go
on
for
ever
how
are
we
to
stop
it
the
fissure
ought
to
be
drenched
with
lime
water
and
then
filled
up
but
all
really
depends
on
what
is
the
size
of
the
supply
and
also
the
depth
it
is
an
extremely
heavy
gas
and
would
lie
at
the
bottom
of
a
cutting
like
water
i
think
there
is
more
here
just
now
than
is
good
for
us
i
added
but
how
continued
bainbridge
as
we
moved
a
few
steps
from
the
fatal
spot
do
you
account
for
the
interval
between
the
first
death
and
the
second
the
escape
must
have
been
intermittent
if
wind
blew
down
the
cutting
as
probably
was
the
case
before
this
frost
set
in
it
would
keep
the
gas
so
diluted
that
its
effects
would
not
be
noticed
there
was
enough
down
here
this
morning
before
that
train
came
through
to
poison
an
army
indeed
if
it
had
not
been
for
henderson
promptitude
there
would
have
been
another
inquest
on
myself
i
then
related
my
own
experience
well
this
clears
wynne
without
doubt
said
bainbridge
but
alas
for
the
two
poor
fellows
who
were
victims
bell
the
lytton
vale
railway
company
owe
you
unlimited
thanks
you
have
doubtless
saved
many
lives
and
also
the
company
for
the
line
must
have
been
closed
if
you
had
not
made
your
valuable
discovery
but
now
come
home
with
me
to
breakfast
we
can
discuss
all
those
matters
later
on
iv
the
lock
it
was
in
the
august
of
when
i
was
just
arranging
my
annual
holiday
that
i
received
the
following
letter
i
tore
it
open
and
read
goring
dear
bell
can
you
come
down
on
wednesday
and
stay
with
us
for
a
week
the
weather
is
glorious
and
the
river
looking
its
best
we
are
a
gay
party
and
there
will
be
plenty
of
fun
going
on
yours
very
truly
helena
ridsdale
this
was
exactly
what
i
wanted
i
was
fond
of
the
river
and
scarcely
a
summer
passed
that
i
did
not
spend
at
least
a
fortnight
on
the
thames
i
could
go
for
a
week
to
the
ridsdales
and
then
start
off
on
my
own
quiet
holiday
afterwards
i
had
known
lady
ridsdale
since
she
was
a
girl
and
i
had
no
doubt
my
visit
would
prove
a
most
enjoyable
one
i
replied
immediately
accepting
the
invitation
and
three
days
later
arrived
at
goring
as
the
little
punt
which
had
been
sent
to
bring
me
across
the
river
drew
up
alongside
the
the
countess
came
down
from
the
deck
to
welcome
me
i
am
so
glad
you
could
come
bell
she
said
i
was
afraid
you
might
be
away
on
some
of
your
extraordinary
campaigns
against
the
supernatural
this
is
ralph
vyner
he
is
also
like
yourself
devoted
to
science
i
am
sure
you
will
find
many
interests
in
common
a
short
thickset
wiry
little
man
dressed
in
white
flannels
who
had
been
lolling
in
a
deck
chair
now
came
forward
and
shook
hands
with
me
i
know
of
you
by
reputation
bell
he
said
and
i
have
often
hoped
to
have
the
pleasure
of
meeting
you
i
am
sure
we
shall
all
be
anxious
to
hear
of
some
of
your
experiences
we
are
such
an
excessively
frivolous
party
that
we
can
easily
afford
to
be
leavened
with
a
little
serious
element
but
i
do
mean
to
be
serious
in
the
least
i
answered
laughing
i
have
come
here
to
enjoy
myself
and
intend
to
be
as
frivolous
as
the
rest
of
you
you
will
have
an
opportunity
this
evening
said
the
countess
we
are
going
to
have
a
special
band
from
town
and
intend
to
have
a
moonlight
dance
on
deck
ah
here
comes
charlie
with
the
others
she
added
shading
her
eyes
and
looking
down
the
stream
in
a
few
moments
a
perfectly
appointed
little
electric
launch
shot
up
and
my
host
with
the
rest
of
the
party
came
on
board
we
shortly
afterwards
sat
down
to
lunch
and
a
gayer
and
pleasanter
set
of
people
i
have
seldom
met
in
the
afternoon
we
broke
up
into
detachments
and
vyner
and
i
went
for
a
long
pull
up
stream
i
found
him
a
pleasant
fellow
ready
to
talk
at
any
length
not
only
about
his
own
hobbies
but
about
the
world
at
large
i
discovered
presently
that
he
was
a
naval
engineer
of
no
small
attainments
when
we
returned
to
the
it
was
nearly
time
to
prepare
for
dinner
most
of
the
ladies
had
already
retired
to
their
cabins
lady
ridsdale
was
standing
alone
on
deck
when
she
saw
us
both
she
called
to
us
to
come
to
her
side
this
quite
dazzles
me
she
said
in
a
low
somewhat
mysterious
tone
and
i
must
show
it
to
you
i
know
you
at
least
vyner
will
appreciate
it
as
she
spoke
she
took
a
small
leather
case
out
of
her
pocket
it
was
ornamented
with
a
monogram
and
opened
with
a
catch
she
pressed
the
lid
it
flew
up
and
i
saw
resting
on
a
velvet
bed
a
glittering
circlet
of
enormous
diamonds
the
countess
lifted
them
out
and
slipped
them
over
her
slender
wrist
they
are
some
of
the
family
diamonds
she
said
with
excitement
and
of
great
value
charlie
is
having
all
the
jewels
reset
for
me
but
the
rest
are
not
ready
yet
he
has
just
brought
this
down
from
town
is
it
not
superb
did
you
ever
see
such
beauties
the
diamonds
flashed
on
her
white
wrist
she
looked
up
at
me
with
eyes
almost
as
bright
i
love
beautiful
stones
she
said
and
i
feel
as
if
these
were
alive
oh
do
look
at
the
rays
of
colour
in
them
as
many
as
in
the
rainbow
i
congratulated
lady
ridsdale
on
possessing
such
a
splendid
ornament
and
then
glanced
at
vyner
expecting
him
to
say
something
the
expression
on
his
face
startled
me
and
i
was
destined
to
remember
it
the
ruddy
look
had
completely
left
it
his
eyes
were
half
starting
from
his
head
he
peered
close
and
suddenly
without
the
slightest
warning
stretched
out
his
hand
and
touched
the
diamonds
as
they
glittered
round
lady
ridsdale
wrist
she
started
back
haughtily
then
recovering
herself
took
the
bracelet
off
and
put
it
into
his
hand
charlie
tells
me
she
said
that
this
bracelet
is
worth
from
fifteen
to
twenty
thousand
pounds
you
must
take
care
of
it
remarked
vyner
do
let
your
maid
see
it
for
instance
oh
nonsense
laughed
lady
ridsdale
i
would
trust
louise
as
i
would
trust
myself
soon
afterwards
we
separated
and
i
went
down
to
my
little
cabin
to
prepare
for
dinner
when
we
met
in
the
dining
saloon
i
noticed
that
lady
ridsdale
was
wearing
the
diamond
bracelet
almost
immediately
after
dinner
the
band
came
on
board
and
the
dancing
began
we
kept
up
our
festivities
until
two
and
more
than
once
as
she
flashed
past
me
i
could
not
help
noticing
the
glittering
circlet
round
her
wrist
i
considered
myself
a
fair
judge
of
precious
stones
but
had
never
seen
any
diamonds
for
size
and
brilliancy
to
equal
these
as
vyner
and
i
happened
to
stand
apart
from
the
others
he
remarked
upon
them
it
was
imprudent
of
ridsdale
to
bring
those
diamonds
here
he
said
suppose
they
are
stolen
scarcely
likely
i
answered
there
are
no
thieves
on
board
he
gave
an
impatient
movement
as
far
as
we
there
are
not
he
said
slowly
but
one
can
never
tell
the
diamonds
are
of
exceptional
value
and
it
is
not
safe
to
expose
ordinary
folk
to
temptation
that
small
circlet
means
a
fortune
he
sighed
deeply
and
when
i
spoke
to
him
next
did
not
answer
me
not
long
afterwards
our
gay
party
dispersed
and
we
retired
to
our
respective
cabins
i
went
to
mine
and
was
quickly
in
bed
as
a
guest
i
was
given
a
cabin
on
board
but
several
other
members
of
the
party
were
sleeping
in
tents
on
the
shore
vyner
and
lord
ridsdale
were
amongst
the
latter
number
whether
it
was
the
narrowness
of
my
bunk
or
the
heat
of
the
night
i
can
not
tell
but
sleep
i
could
not
suddenly
through
my
open
window
i
heard
voices
from
the
shore
near
by
i
could
identify
the
speakers
by
their
tones
one
was
my
host
lord
ridsdale
the
other
ralph
vyner
whatever
formed
the
subject
of
discourse
it
was
evidently
far
from
amicable
however
much
averse
i
might
feel
to
the
situation
i
was
compelled
to
be
an
unwilling
eavesdropper
for
the
voices
rose
and
i
caught
the
following
words
from
vyner
can
you
lend
me
five
thousand
pounds
till
the
winter
no
vyner
i
have
told
you
so
before
and
the
reason
too
it
is
your
own
fault
and
you
must
take
the
consequences
do
you
mean
that
to
be
final
asked
vyner
yes
very
well
then
i
shall
look
after
myself
thank
god
i
have
got
brains
if
i
have
not
money
and
i
shall
not
let
the
means
interfere
with
the
end
you
can
go
to
the
devil
for
all
i
care
was
the
angry
answer
and
after
what
i
know
i
wo
raise
a
finger
to
help
you
the
speakers
had
evidently
moved
further
off
for
the
last
words
i
could
not
catch
but
what
little
i
heard
by
no
means
conduced
to
slumber
so
vyner
for
all
his
jovial
and
easy
manner
was
in
a
fix
for
money
and
ridsdale
knew
something
about
him
scarcely
to
his
credit
i
kept
thinking
over
this
and
also
recalling
his
words
when
he
spoke
of
lady
ridsdale
diamonds
as
representing
a
fortune
what
did
he
mean
by
saying
that
he
would
not
let
the
means
interfere
with
the
end
that
brief
sentence
sounded
very
much
like
the
outburst
of
a
desperate
man
i
could
not
help
heartily
wishing
that
lady
ridsdale
diamond
circlet
was
back
in
london
and
just
before
i
dropped
to
sleep
i
made
up
my
mind
to
speak
to
ridsdale
on
the
subject
towards
morning
i
did
doze
off
but
i
was
awakened
by
hearing
my
name
called
and
starting
up
i
saw
ridsdale
standing
by
my
side
his
face
looked
queer
and
excited
wake
up
bell
he
cried
a
terrible
thing
has
happened
what
is
it
i
asked
my
wife
bracelet
is
stolen
like
a
flash
i
thought
of
vyner
and
then
as
quickly
i
knew
that
i
must
be
careful
to
give
no
voice
to
suspicions
i
wo
be
a
moment
dressing
and
then
i
join
you
i
said
ridsdale
nodded
and
left
my
cabin
in
five
minutes
i
was
with
him
on
deck
he
then
told
me
briefly
what
had
happened
helena
most
imprudently
left
the
case
on
her
last
night
he
said
and
owing
to
the
heat
she
kept
the
window
open
some
one
must
have
waded
into
the
water
in
the
dark
and
stolen
it
perhaps
one
of
the
bandsmen
may
have
noticed
the
flashing
of
the
diamonds
on
her
wrist
and
returned
to
secure
the
bracelet
there
no
saying
the
only
too
palpable
fact
is
that
it
is
gone
it
was
valued
at
twenty
thousand
pounds
have
you
sent
for
the
police
i
asked
yes
and
have
also
wired
to
scotland
yard
for
one
of
their
best
detectives
vyner
took
the
telegram
for
me
and
was
to
call
at
the
police
station
on
his
way
back
he
is
nearly
as
much
upset
as
i
am
this
is
a
terrible
loss
i
feel
fit
to
kill
myself
for
my
folly
in
bringing
that
valuable
bracelet
on
board
a
it
was
a
little
imprudent
i
answered
but
you
are
sure
to
get
it
back
i
hope
so
he
replied
moodily
just
then
the
punt
with
vyner
and
a
couple
of
policemen
on
board
was
seen
rapidly
approaching
ridsdale
went
to
meet
them
and
was
soon
in
earnest
conversation
with
the
superintendent
of
police
the
moment
vyner
leapt
on
board
he
came
to
the
part
of
the
deck
where
i
was
standing
ah
bell
he
cried
what
about
my
prognostications
of
last
night
they
have
been
verified
too
soon
i
answered
i
gave
him
a
quick
glance
his
eyes
looked
straight
into
mine
have
you
any
theory
to
account
for
the
theft
i
asked
yes
a
very
simple
one
owing
to
the
heat
of
the
evening
the
countess
slept
with
her
window
open
it
was
an
easy
matter
to
wade
through
the
water
introduce
a
hand
through
the
open
window
and
purloin
the
diamonds
without
being
seen
by
any
occupants
of
the
tents
i
queried
certainly
he
answered
speaking
slowly
and
with
thought
then
you
believe
the
thief
came
from
without
i
do
what
about
your
warning
to
lady
ridsdale
yesterday
evening
not
to
trust
her
maid
i
saw
his
eyes
flash
it
was
the
briefest
of
summer
lightning
that
played
in
their
depths
i
knew
that
he
longed
to
adopt
the
suggestion
that
i
had
on
purpose
thrown
out
but
dared
not
that
one
look
was
enough
for
me
i
had
guessed
his
secret
before
he
could
reply
to
my
last
remark
lord
ridsdale
came
up
what
is
to
be
done
he
said
the
police
superintendent
insists
on
our
all
without
respect
of
persons
being
searched
there
is
nothing
in
that
i
said
it
is
the
usual
thing
i
will
be
the
first
to
submit
to
the
examination
the
police
went
through
their
work
thoroughly
and
of
course
came
across
neither
clue
nor
diamonds
we
presently
sat
down
to
breakfast
but
i
do
think
we
any
of
us
had
much
appetite
lady
ridsdale
eyes
were
red
with
crying
and
i
could
see
that
the
loss
had
shaken
both
her
nerve
and
fortitude
it
was
more
or
less
of
a
relief
when
the
post
came
in
amongst
the
letters
i
found
a
telegram
for
myself
i
knew
what
it
meant
before
i
opened
it
it
was
from
a
man
in
a
distant
part
of
the
country
whom
i
had
promised
to
assist
in
a
matter
of
grave
importance
i
saw
that
it
was
necessary
for
me
to
return
to
town
without
delay
i
was
very
loth
to
leave
my
host
and
hostess
in
their
present
dilemma
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
and
soon
after
breakfast
i
took
my
leave
ridsdale
promised
to
write
me
if
there
was
any
news
of
the
diamonds
and
soon
the
circumstance
passed
more
or
less
into
the
background
of
my
brain
owing
to
the
intense
interest
of
the
other
matter
which
i
had
taken
up
my
work
in
the
north
was
over
and
i
had
returned
to
town
when
i
received
a
letter
from
ridsdale
we
are
in
a
state
of
despair
he
wrote
we
have
had
two
detectives
on
board
and
the
police
have
moved
heaven
and
earth
to
try
and
discover
the
bracelet
all
in
vain
not
the
slightest
clue
has
been
forthcoming
no
one
has
worked
harder
for
us
than
vyner
he
has
a
small
place
of
his
own
further
down
the
river
and
comes
up
to
see
us
almost
daily
he
has
made
all
sorts
of
suggestions
for
the
recovery
of
the
diamonds
but
hitherto
they
have
led
to
nothing
in
short
our
one
hope
now
turns
upon
you
bell
you
have
done
as
difficult
things
as
this
before
will
you
come
and
see
us
and
give
us
the
benefit
of
your
advice
if
any
man
can
solve
this
mystery
you
are
the
person
i
wrote
immediately
to
say
that
i
would
return
to
the
on
the
following
evening
and
for
the
remainder
of
that
day
tried
to
the
best
of
my
ability
to
think
out
this
most
difficult
problem
i
felt
morally
certain
that
i
could
put
my
hand
on
the
thief
but
i
had
no
real
clue
to
work
upon
nothing
beyond
a
nameless
suspicion
strange
as
it
may
seem
i
was
moved
by
sentiment
i
had
spent
some
pleasant
hours
in
society
i
had
enjoyed
his
conversation
i
had
liked
the
man
for
himself
he
had
abilities
above
the
average
of
that
i
was
certain
if
he
were
proved
guilty
i
did
not
want
to
be
the
one
to
bring
his
crime
home
to
him
so
uncomfortable
were
my
feelings
that
at
last
i
made
up
my
mind
to
take
a
somewhat
bold
step
this
was
neither
more
nor
less
than
to
go
to
see
vyner
himself
before
visiting
the
what
i
was
to
do
and
say
when
i
got
to
him
i
was
obliged
to
leave
altogether
to
chance
but
i
had
a
feeling
almost
amounting
to
a
certainty
that
by
means
of
this
visit
i
should
ultimately
return
the
bracelet
to
my
friends
the
ridsdales
the
next
afternoon
i
found
myself
rowing
slowly
down
the
river
thinking
what
the
issue
of
my
visit
to
vyner
would
be
it
happened
to
be
a
perfect
evening
the
sun
had
just
set
the
long
reach
of
river
stretched
away
to
the
distant
bend
where
through
the
gathering
twilight
i
could
just
see
the
white
gates
of
the
lock
raising
my
voice
i
sang
out
in
a
sonorous
monotone
the
familiar
cry
of
lock
lock
lock
and
bending
to
the
sculls
sent
my
little
skiff
flying
down
stream
the
sturdy
figure
of
old
james
pegg
the
whom
i
had
known
for
many
years
instantly
appeared
on
the
bridge
one
of
the
great
gates
slowly
swung
open
and
shipping
my
sculls
i
shot
in
and
called
out
a
cheery
to
my
old
friend
mr
bell
exclaimed
the
old
fellow
hurrying
along
the
edge
of
the
lock
well
i
never
i
did
not
see
it
was
you
at
first
and
yet
i
ought
to
have
known
that
long
swinging
stroke
of
yours
you
are
the
last
person
i
expected
to
see
i
was
half
afraid
it
might
be
some
one
else
although
i
do
know
that
i
was
expecting
any
one
in
particular
excuse
me
sir
but
was
it
you
called
out
just
now
of
course
it
was
i
answered
laughing
i
in
the
deuce
of
a
hurry
jimmy
as
i
want
to
get
on
to
wotton
before
dark
look
sharp
will
you
and
let
me
down
all
right
sir
but
you
did
frighten
me
just
now
i
wish
you
called
out
like
that
as
i
glanced
up
at
him
i
was
surprised
to
see
that
his
usually
ruddy
round
face
was
as
white
as
a
sheet
and
he
was
breathing
quickly
why
what
on
earth
is
the
matter
jimmy
i
cried
how
can
i
have
frightened
you
oh
it
nothing
sir
i
suppose
i
an
old
fool
he
faltered
smiling
i
do
know
what
the
matter
with
me
sir
i
all
of
a
tremble
the
fact
is
something
happened
here
last
night
and
i
seem
to
have
got
over
it
you
know
i
am
all
by
myself
here
now
sir
and
a
lonely
place
it
is
something
happened
i
said
not
an
accident
i
hope
no
sir
no
accident
that
i
know
of
and
yet
i
have
been
half
expecting
one
to
occur
all
day
and
i
have
been
that
weak
i
could
hardly
wind
up
the
sluices
i
am
getting
old
now
and
i
not
the
man
i
was
but
right
glad
to
see
you
bell
that
i
am
he
kept
pausing
as
he
spoke
and
now
and
then
glanced
up
the
river
as
if
expecting
to
see
a
boat
coming
round
the
bend
every
moment
i
was
much
puzzled
by
his
extraordinary
manner
i
knew
him
to
be
a
steady
man
and
one
whose
services
were
much
valued
by
the
conservancy
but
it
needed
only
a
glance
now
to
show
that
there
was
something
very
much
amiss
with
him
the
darkness
was
increasing
every
moment
and
being
anxious
to
get
on
as
soon
as
possible
i
was
just
going
to
tell
him
again
to
hurry
up
with
the
sluices
when
he
bent
down
close
to
me
and
said
would
you
mind
stepping
out
for
a
moment
sir
if
you
can
spare
the
time
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
sir
i
be
most
grateful
if
you
would
wait
a
minute
or
two
certainly
jimmy
i
answered
hauling
myself
to
the
side
with
the
and
getting
out
is
there
anything
i
can
do
for
you
i
am
afraid
you
are
not
well
i
never
saw
you
like
this
before
no
sir
and
i
never
felt
like
it
before
that
i
can
remember
something
happened
here
last
night
that
has
taken
all
the
nerve
out
of
me
and
i
want
to
tell
you
what
it
was
i
know
you
are
so
clever
bell
and
i
have
heard
about
your
doings
up
at
wallinghurst
last
autumn
when
you
cleared
up
the
manor
house
ghost
and
got
old
monkford
six
months
well
fire
away
i
said
filling
my
pipe
and
wondering
what
was
coming
it
is
this
way
sir
he
began
last
night
after
i
had
had
my
supper
i
thought
i
like
a
stroll
and
a
quiet
smoke
along
the
towing
path
before
turning
in
i
did
not
expect
any
more
boats
as
it
was
getting
on
for
ten
i
walked
about
of
a
mile
and
was
just
going
to
turn
round
when
i
saw
a
light
down
on
the
surface
of
the
water
in
it
was
pretty
dark
for
the
moon
was
not
up
yet
and
there
was
a
thick
white
mist
rising
from
the
water
i
thought
it
must
be
some
one
in
a
canoe
at
first
so
i
waited
a
bit
and
watched
then
it
suddenly
disappeared
and
the
next
instant
i
saw
it
again
about
a
hundred
yards
or
so
higher
up
the
stream
but
only
for
a
second
and
then
it
went
out
it
fairly
puzzled
me
to
know
what
it
could
be
as
i
had
never
seen
anything
like
it
before
i
felt
sure
it
was
any
sort
of
craft
but
i
had
heard
of
strange
lights
being
seen
at
times
on
the
water
what
they
call
i
believe
sir
i
reckoned
it
might
be
one
of
them
but
i
thought
i
get
back
to
the
lock
so
that
if
it
was
a
canoe
i
could
let
it
through
however
nothing
came
of
it
and
i
waited
and
watched
and
worried
all
the
evening
about
it
but
could
come
to
any
sort
of
idea
so
i
went
to
bed
well
about
one
this
morning
i
suddenly
woke
up
and
thought
i
could
hear
some
one
a
long
way
off
calling
exactly
as
you
did
just
now
lock
lock
but
it
sounded
ever
so
far
away
some
of
those
theatre
people
coming
back
to
the
i
said
to
myself
i
not
going
to
turn
out
for
them
the
lock
was
full
at
the
time
so
i
thought
i
would
just
let
them
work
it
for
themselves
i
waited
a
bit
expecting
to
hear
them
every
minute
come
up
singing
and
swearing
as
they
do
but
they
never
came
and
i
was
just
dropping
off
when
i
heard
the
call
again
it
was
not
an
ordinary
sort
of
voice
but
a
long
wailing
cry
just
as
if
some
one
was
in
trouble
or
drowning
hi
lock
it
went
i
got
up
then
and
went
out
the
moon
was
up
now
and
quite
bright
and
the
mist
had
cleared
off
so
i
went
to
the
bridge
on
the
upper
gates
and
looked
up
stream
this
is
where
i
was
standing
sir
just
as
we
are
standing
now
i
could
see
right
up
to
the
bend
and
there
was
not
the
sign
of
a
boat
i
stood
straining
my
eyes
expecting
to
see
a
boat
come
round
every
moment
when
i
heard
the
cry
again
and
this
time
it
sounded
not
fifty
yards
up
stream
i
could
not
make
it
out
at
all
so
i
shouted
out
as
loud
as
i
could
are
you
what
the
matter
but
there
was
no
answer
and
then
suddenly
the
next
instant
close
below
me
from
the
lock
this
time
just
here
came
a
shout
piercing
shrill
and
loud
the
lock
quick
quick
open
the
lock
i
tell
you
sir
my
heart
seemed
to
stand
dead
still
and
i
nearly
fell
back
over
the
bridge
i
wheeled
round
sharp
but
there
was
nothing
in
the
lock
that
i
swear
to
my
dying
day
for
i
could
see
all
over
it
and
nothing
could
have
got
in
there
without
passing
me
the
moon
was
quite
bright
and
i
could
see
all
round
it
without
knowing
what
i
was
doing
i
rushed
down
like
mad
to
the
lower
gates
and
began
to
wind
up
one
of
the
sluices
and
then
i
stood
there
and
waited
but
nothing
came
as
the
lock
emptied
i
looked
down
but
there
was
no
sign
of
anything
anywhere
so
i
let
down
the
sluice
without
opening
the
gates
and
then
filled
up
the
lock
again
i
stood
by
the
post
hardly
daring
to
move
when
about
five
thank
god
i
heard
the
whistle
of
a
tug
and
after
seeing
her
through
it
was
broad
daylight
that
the
whole
story
sir
and
how
i
going
to
live
through
the
night
again
i
do
know
it
was
a
spirit
if
ever
there
was
one
in
the
world
it
a
warning
to
me
sir
and
what
going
to
happen
i
know
well
jimmy
i
answered
it
certainly
is
a
most
extraordinary
story
and
if
i
did
know
you
as
well
as
i
do
i
should
say
you
had
taken
something
more
than
a
smoke
before
you
turned
in
last
night
i
never
touch
a
drop
sir
except
when
i
go
into
farley
and
have
a
glass
of
beer
but
i
have
not
been
there
for
more
than
a
week
now
i
confess
that
jimmy
story
had
left
a
most
unpleasant
impression
on
me
i
had
little
doubt
that
the
whole
thing
was
some
strange
subjective
hallucination
but
for
a
weird
and
ghostly
experience
it
certainly
beat
most
of
the
tales
i
had
ever
heard
i
thought
for
a
moment
it
was
now
quite
dark
and
i
felt
little
inclined
to
go
on
to
wotton
my
keenest
interests
were
awakened
look
here
i
said
what
do
you
say
if
i
stay
here
can
you
give
me
a
of
any
sort
that
i
will
sir
and
right
gladly
and
thank
god
if
you
will
but
stay
with
me
if
i
was
alone
here
again
and
heard
that
voice
i
believe
it
would
kill
me
i
tie
up
your
boat
outside
and
bring
your
things
in
and
then
we
have
supper
i
feel
a
new
man
with
you
staying
here
sir
in
a
few
minutes
we
were
both
inside
old
jimmy
cosy
quarters
his
whole
bearing
seemed
to
have
changed
suddenly
and
he
ran
about
with
alacrity
getting
supper
ready
and
seeming
quite
like
himself
again
during
the
whole
evening
he
kept
harping
at
intervals
on
the
subject
of
the
mysterious
voice
but
we
heard
no
sound
whatever
and
i
felt
more
and
more
certain
that
the
whole
thing
was
due
to
hallucination
on
the
part
of
the
old
man
at
eleven
a
skiff
came
up
through
the
lock
and
almost
immediately
afterwards
i
bade
jimmy
and
went
into
the
little
room
he
had
prepared
for
me
i
went
quickly
to
bed
and
tired
after
my
long
pull
despite
the
originality
of
the
situation
fell
fast
asleep
suddenly
i
awoke
some
one
was
bending
over
me
and
calling
me
by
my
name
i
leapt
up
and
not
realising
where
i
was
for
the
moment
but
with
a
sort
of
dim
idea
that
i
was
engaged
in
some
exposure
instinctively
seized
the
man
roughly
by
the
throat
in
a
moment
i
remembered
everything
and
quickly
released
my
grip
of
poor
old
jimmy
who
was
gurgling
and
gasping
with
horror
i
burst
out
laughing
at
my
mistake
and
begged
his
pardon
for
treating
him
so
roughly
it
is
all
right
sir
he
panted
i
hope
i
did
frighten
you
but
i
have
heard
it
again
not
five
minutes
ago
the
deuce
you
have
i
said
striking
a
match
and
looking
at
my
watch
it
was
nearly
two
and
before
the
minute
was
up
i
heard
distinctly
a
cry
as
if
from
some
great
distance
of
lock
lock
lock
and
then
all
was
silence
again
did
you
hear
it
sir
whispered
the
old
man
clutching
me
by
the
arm
with
a
trembling
hand
yes
i
heard
it
i
said
do
you
be
frightened
jimmy
just
wait
till
i
get
my
clothes
on
i
am
going
to
see
this
thing
through
be
careful
sir
for
god
sake
be
careful
he
whispered
all
right
i
said
slipping
on
some
things
just
get
me
a
good
strong
and
do
make
too
much
noise
if
this
mystery
is
flesh
and
blood
i
get
to
the
bottom
of
it
somehow
you
stay
here
and
if
i
call
come
out
i
took
the
thick
short
which
he
had
brought
me
and
softly
unlatching
the
door
went
out
the
moon
was
now
riding
high
overhead
and
casting
black
fantastic
shadows
across
the
little
white
cottage
all
my
senses
were
on
the
keenest
alert
my
ears
were
pricked
up
for
the
slightest
sound
i
crept
softly
to
the
bridge
on
the
upper
gate
which
was
open
i
looked
up
stream
and
thought
i
could
see
some
little
ripples
on
the
surface
of
the
water
as
if
a
swift
boat
had
just
passed
down
but
there
was
no
sign
of
any
craft
whatever
to
be
seen
it
was
intensely
still
and
no
sound
broke
the
silence
save
the
intermittent
croaking
of
some
in
the
dark
shadows
of
the
pollards
on
the
further
bank
behind
me
could
also
be
heard
the
gurgling
twinkle
of
the
overflow
through
the
chinks
of
the
lower
gate
i
stood
quite
still
gripping
the
in
my
hand
and
looking
right
and
left
straining
my
eyes
for
the
slightest
movement
of
anything
around
when
suddenly
close
below
me
from
the
water
inside
the
lock
came
a
loud
cry
open
the
lock
for
god
sake
open
the
lock
i
started
back
feeling
my
hair
rise
and
stiffen
the
sound
echoed
and
reverberated
through
the
silent
night
and
then
died
away
but
before
it
had
done
so
i
had
sprung
to
the
great
beam
and
closed
the
upper
gate
as
i
did
so
i
caught
sight
of
the
old
man
trembling
and
shaking
at
the
door
of
the
cottage
i
called
to
him
to
go
and
watch
the
upper
gate
and
racing
down
to
the
lower
ones
wound
up
one
of
the
sluices
with
a
few
pulls
so
as
to
let
out
the
water
with
as
little
escape
room
as
possible
i
knew
by
this
means
if
there
were
any
creature
of
tangible
form
in
the
water
we
must
find
it
when
the
lock
was
emptied
as
its
escape
was
cut
off
illustration
struck
it
a
terrific
blow
with
the
a
master
of
page
each
of
the
following
minutes
seemed
stretched
into
a
lifetime
as
with
eyes
riveted
on
the
dark
water
in
the
lock
i
watched
its
gradual
descent
i
hardly
dared
to
think
of
what
i
expected
to
see
rise
to
the
surface
any
moment
would
the
lock
never
empty
down
down
sank
the
level
and
still
i
saw
nothing
a
long
misshapen
arm
of
black
cloud
was
slowly
stretching
itself
across
the
moon
hark
there
was
something
moving
about
down
in
the
well
of
darkness
below
me
and
as
i
stood
and
watched
i
saw
that
the
water
was
uncovering
a
long
black
mass
and
that
something
ran
slowly
out
of
the
water
and
began
to
clamber
up
the
slimy
slippery
beams
what
in
the
name
of
heaven
could
it
be
by
the
uncertain
light
i
could
only
see
its
dim
outline
it
seemed
to
have
an
enormous
bulbous
head
and
dripping
glistening
body
the
sound
of
a
rapid
patter
up
the
told
me
that
the
old
man
had
seen
it
and
was
running
for
his
life
i
rushed
down
to
where
the
thing
was
and
as
its
great
head
appeared
above
the
edge
with
all
my
force
struck
it
a
terrific
blow
with
the
the
weapon
flew
into
splinters
in
my
hand
and
the
next
moment
the
creature
had
leapt
up
beside
me
and
dashed
me
to
the
ground
with
almost
superhuman
force
i
was
up
and
on
to
it
again
in
a
second
and
as
i
caught
and
closed
with
it
saw
that
i
had
at
least
to
deal
with
a
human
being
and
that
what
he
lacked
in
stature
he
more
than
made
up
for
in
strength
the
struggle
that
ensued
was
desperate
and
furious
the
covering
to
his
head
that
had
splintered
the
was
i
saw
a
sort
of
helmet
completely
protecting
the
head
from
any
blow
and
the
body
was
cased
in
a
slippery
closely
fitting
garment
that
kept
eluding
my
grasp
to
and
fro
we
swayed
and
wrestled
and
for
a
moment
i
thought
i
had
met
my
match
till
suddenly
freeing
my
right
arm
i
got
in
a
smashing
blow
in
the
region
of
the
heart
the
creature
uttered
a
cry
of
pain
and
fell
headlong
to
the
ground
old
jimmy
pegg
had
hurried
back
as
soon
as
he
heard
our
struggles
and
knew
that
he
was
not
dealing
with
a
being
of
another
world
he
ran
up
eagerly
to
me
here
your
ghost
you
old
coward
i
panted
he
has
got
the
hardest
bone
and
muscle
i
ever
felt
in
a
ghost
yet
i
am
not
used
to
fighting
men
in
helmets
and
he
is
as
slippery
as
an
eel
but
i
hope
to
goodness
i
have
not
done
more
than
knock
the
wind
out
of
him
he
is
a
specimen
i
should
rather
like
to
take
alive
catch
hold
of
his
feet
and
we
get
him
inside
and
see
who
he
is
between
us
we
carried
the
prostrate
figure
inside
the
cottage
and
laid
him
down
like
a
log
on
the
floor
he
never
moved
nor
uttered
a
sound
and
i
was
afraid
at
first
that
i
had
finished
him
for
good
and
all
i
next
knelt
down
and
proceeded
to
unfasten
the
helmet
which
from
its
appearance
was
something
like
the
kind
used
by
divers
while
the
old
man
brought
the
lantern
close
to
his
face
at
the
first
glance
i
knew
in
an
instant
that
i
had
seen
the
face
before
and
the
next
second
recognised
to
my
utter
astonishment
and
horror
that
it
belonged
to
ralph
vyner
for
the
moment
i
was
completely
dumbfounded
and
gazed
at
the
man
without
speaking
it
was
obvious
that
he
had
only
fainted
from
the
blow
for
i
could
see
that
he
was
breathing
and
in
a
few
minutes
he
opened
his
eyes
and
fixed
them
on
me
with
a
dull
and
vacant
stare
then
he
seemed
to
recall
the
situation
though
he
evidently
did
not
recognise
me
let
me
go
he
cried
making
an
effort
to
rise
my
god
you
have
killed
me
he
pressed
his
hand
to
his
side
and
fell
back
again
his
face
was
contorted
as
if
in
great
pain
there
was
obviously
only
one
thing
to
be
done
and
that
was
to
send
for
medical
assistance
at
once
it
was
clear
that
the
man
was
badly
injured
but
to
what
extent
i
could
not
determine
it
was
impossible
to
extract
the
slightest
further
communication
from
him
he
lay
quite
still
groaning
from
time
to
time
i
told
jimmy
to
go
off
at
once
to
farley
and
bring
the
doctor
i
scribbled
a
few
directions
on
a
piece
of
paper
the
old
man
hurried
out
of
the
cottage
but
in
less
than
a
minute
he
was
back
again
in
great
excitement
look
here
sir
what
i
have
just
picked
up
he
said
it
something
he
has
dropped
i
reckon
as
jimmy
spoke
he
held
out
a
square
leather
case
there
was
a
monogram
on
it
i
took
it
in
my
hand
and
pressed
the
lid
it
flew
open
and
inside
resting
on
its
velvet
bed
lay
the
glittering
circlet
of
diamonds
i
held
lady
ridsdale
lost
bracelet
in
my
hand
all
my
suspicions
were
confirmed
vyner
was
the
thief
without
saying
a
word
i
shut
the
box
and
despatched
the
old
man
at
once
for
the
doctor
bidding
him
go
as
fast
as
he
could
then
i
sat
down
by
the
prostrate
man
and
waited
i
knew
that
jimmy
could
not
be
back
for
at
least
two
hours
the
grey
dawn
was
beginning
to
steal
in
through
the
little
latticed
window
when
vyner
moved
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
at
me
he
started
as
his
eyes
fell
on
the
case
you
are
bell
he
said
slowly
ridsdale
told
me
that
you
were
coming
to
the
on
purpose
to
discover
the
mystery
of
the
lost
diamonds
you
did
know
that
i
should
give
you
an
opportunity
of
discovering
the
truth
even
before
you
arrived
at
the
bend
down
close
to
me
you
have
injured
me
i
may
not
recover
hear
what
i
have
to
say
i
bent
over
him
prepared
to
listen
to
his
words
which
came
out
slowly
i
am
a
forger
and
a
desperate
man
three
weeks
ago
i
forged
one
of
ridsdale
cheques
and
lessened
my
friend
balance
to
the
tune
of
five
thousand
pounds
he
and
his
wife
were
old
friends
of
mine
but
i
wanted
the
money
desperately
and
was
impervious
to
sentiment
or
anything
else
on
that
first
day
when
you
met
me
although
i
seemed
cheery
enough
i
was
fit
to
kill
myself
i
had
hoped
to
be
able
to
restore
the
stolen
money
long
before
ridsdale
was
likely
to
miss
it
but
this
hope
had
failed
i
saw
no
loophole
of
escape
and
the
day
of
reckoning
could
not
be
far
off
what
devil
prompted
ridsdale
to
bring
those
diamonds
on
board
heaven
only
knows
the
moment
i
saw
them
they
fascinated
me
and
i
knew
i
should
have
a
try
for
them
all
during
that
evening
festivity
i
could
think
of
nothing
else
i
made
up
my
mind
to
secure
them
by
hook
or
by
crook
before
we
retired
for
the
night
however
i
thought
i
would
give
ridsdale
a
chance
i
asked
him
if
he
would
lend
me
the
exact
sum
i
had
already
stolen
from
him
five
thousand
pounds
but
he
had
heard
rumours
to
my
discredit
and
refused
i
hated
him
for
it
i
went
into
my
tent
under
the
pretence
of
lying
down
but
in
reality
to
concoct
and
if
possible
carry
out
my
plot
i
waited
until
the
quietest
hour
before
dawn
then
i
slipped
out
of
my
tent
waded
into
the
water
approached
the
open
window
of
the
countess
cabin
thrust
in
my
hand
took
out
the
case
and
going
down
the
river
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
threw
the
diamonds
into
the
middle
of
the
stream
i
marked
well
the
place
where
they
sank
i
then
returned
to
my
tent
and
went
to
bed
you
know
what
occurred
the
following
morning
i
neither
feared
ridsdale
nor
his
wife
but
you
bell
gave
me
a
considerable
amount
of
uneasiness
i
felt
certain
that
in
an
evil
moment
on
the
night
before
i
had
given
you
a
clue
to
a
man
of
your
ability
the
slightest
clue
was
i
felt
that
i
must
take
the
bull
by
the
horns
and
find
out
whether
you
suspected
me
or
not
i
talked
to
you
and
guessed
by
the
tone
of
your
remarks
that
you
had
your
suspicions
my
relief
was
immense
when
that
telegram
arrived
which
hurried
you
away
from
the
on
the
following
day
i
returned
to
my
own
little
place
on
the
banks
of
the
river
four
miles
below
this
lock
i
knew
it
was
necessary
for
me
to
remain
quiet
for
a
time
but
all
the
same
my
plans
were
clearly
made
and
i
only
waited
until
the
first
excitement
of
the
loss
had
subsided
and
the
police
and
detectives
were
off
their
guard
in
the
meantime
i
went
to
see
ridsdale
almost
daily
and
suggested
many
expedients
for
securing
the
thief
and
getting
hold
of
the
right
clue
if
he
ever
suspected
me
which
i
do
for
a
moment
suppose
i
certainly
put
him
off
the
scent
my
intention
was
to
take
the
diamonds
out
of
the
country
sell
them
for
all
that
i
could
get
then
return
the
five
thousand
pounds
which
i
had
stolen
from
his
bank
and
leave
england
for
ever
as
a
forger
i
should
be
followed
to
the
world
end
but
as
the
possessor
of
stolen
diamonds
i
felt
myself
practically
safe
my
scheme
was
too
cleverly
worked
out
to
give
the
ordinary
detective
a
chance
of
discovering
me
two
days
ago
i
had
a
letter
from
ridsdale
in
which
he
told
me
that
he
intended
to
put
the
matter
into
your
hands
now
this
was
by
no
means
to
my
mind
for
you
bell
happened
to
be
the
one
man
in
the
world
whom
i
really
dreaded
i
saw
that
i
must
no
longer
lose
time
under
my
little
i
had
a
small
submarine
boat
which
i
had
lately
finished
more
as
a
hobby
than
anything
else
i
had
begun
it
years
ago
in
my
odd
moments
on
a
model
i
had
seen
of
a
torpedo
used
in
the
american
war
my
boat
is
now
in
the
lock
outside
and
you
will
see
for
yourself
what
ingenuity
was
needed
to
construct
such
a
thing
on
the
night
before
the
one
which
has
just
passed
i
got
it
ready
and
as
soon
as
it
was
dark
started
off
in
it
to
recover
the
diamonds
i
got
through
the
lock
easily
by
going
in
under
the
water
with
a
barge
but
when
i
reached
the
spot
where
i
had
sunk
the
diamonds
found
to
my
dismay
that
my
electric
light
would
not
work
there
was
no
help
for
it
i
could
not
find
the
bracelet
without
the
aid
of
the
light
and
was
bound
to
return
home
to
repair
the
lamp
this
delay
was
fraught
with
danger
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
my
difficulty
now
was
to
get
back
through
the
lock
for
though
i
waited
for
quite
three
hours
no
boats
came
along
i
saw
the
upper
gates
were
open
but
how
to
get
through
the
lower
ones
i
could
not
conceive
i
felt
sure
that
my
only
chance
was
to
frighten
the
and
get
him
to
open
the
sluices
for
i
knew
i
could
pass
through
them
unobserved
if
they
were
open
as
i
had
done
once
before
in
my
diver
helmet
was
a
thick
glass
this
had
an
opening
closed
by
a
cap
which
could
be
unscrewed
and
through
which
i
could
breathe
when
above
water
and
also
through
which
my
voice
would
come
causing
a
peculiar
hollowness
which
i
guessed
would
have
a
very
startling
effect
especially
as
i
myself
would
be
quite
invisible
i
got
into
the
lock
and
shouted
to
pegg
i
succeeded
in
frightening
him
he
hurried
to
do
what
i
ordered
he
wound
up
the
lower
sluice
i
shot
through
under
water
and
so
got
back
unseen
all
yesterday
i
hesitated
about
trying
the
experiment
again
the
risk
was
so
great
but
i
knew
that
ridsdale
was
certain
to
see
his
soon
that
my
forgery
was
in
imminent
danger
of
being
discovered
also
that
you
bell
were
coming
upon
the
scene
yes
at
any
risk
i
must
now
go
on
i
repaired
my
light
and
again
last
night
passed
through
the
lock
on
my
way
up
by
simply
waiting
for
another
boat
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
passed
up
through
this
lock
under
a
skiff
about
eleven
my
light
was
now
all
right
i
found
the
diamond
case
easily
and
turned
to
pass
down
the
stream
by
the
same
method
as
before
if
you
had
not
been
here
i
should
have
succeeded
and
should
have
been
safe
but
now
it
is
all
up
he
paused
and
his
breath
came
quickly
i
doubt
if
i
shall
recover
he
said
in
a
feeble
voice
i
hope
you
will
i
replied
and
hark
i
think
i
hear
the
steps
i
was
right
for
a
moment
or
two
later
old
jimmy
pegg
and
simmons
entered
the
cottage
while
the
doctor
was
examining
the
patient
and
talking
to
him
i
went
out
with
jimmy
to
have
a
look
at
the
submarine
boat
by
fixing
a
rope
round
it
we
managed
to
haul
it
up
and
then
proceeded
to
examine
it
it
certainly
was
the
most
wonderful
piece
of
ingenious
engineering
i
had
ever
seen
the
boat
was
in
the
shape
of
an
enormous
cigar
and
was
made
of
aluminium
it
was
seven
feet
long
and
had
a
circular
beam
of
sixteen
inches
at
the
pointed
end
close
to
where
the
occupant
feet
would
be
was
an
air
chamber
capable
of
being
filled
or
emptied
at
will
by
means
of
a
compressed
air
cylinder
enabling
the
man
to
rise
or
sink
whenever
he
wished
to
inside
the
boat
was
lined
with
flat
chambers
of
compressed
air
for
breathing
purposes
which
were
governed
by
a
valve
it
was
also
provided
with
a
small
accumulator
and
electric
motor
which
drove
the
tiny
propeller
astern
the
helmet
which
the
man
wore
fitted
around
the
opening
at
the
head
end
after
examining
the
boat
it
was
easy
to
see
how
vyner
had
escaped
through
the
lock
the
night
before
i
arrived
as
this
submarine
wonder
of
ingenuity
would
be
able
to
shoot
through
the
sluice
gate
under
water
when
the
sluice
was
raised
to
empty
the
lock
after
exchanging
a
few
remarks
with
jimmy
i
returned
to
the
cottage
to
learn
the
doctor
verdict
it
was
grave
but
not
despairing
the
patient
could
not
be
moved
for
a
day
or
two
he
was
in
simmons
opinion
suffering
more
from
shock
than
anything
else
if
he
remained
perfectly
quiet
he
would
in
all
probability
recover
if
he
were
disturbed
the
consequences
might
be
serious
an
hour
afterwards
i
found
myself
on
my
way
up
stream
sculling
as
fast
as
i
could
in
the
direction
of
the
i
arrived
there
at
an
early
hour
and
put
the
case
which
contained
the
diamonds
into
lady
ridsdale
hands
i
shall
never
forget
the
astonishment
of
ridsdale
and
his
wife
when
i
told
my
strange
tale
the
countess
burst
into
tears
and
ridsdale
was
terribly
agitated
i
have
known
vyner
from
a
boy
and
so
has
my
wife
he
exclaimed
of
course
this
proves
him
to
be
an
unmitigated
scoundrel
but
i
can
not
be
the
one
to
bring
him
to
justice
oh
no
charlie
whatever
happens
we
must
forgive
him
said
lady
ridsdale
looking
up
with
a
white
face
i
had
nothing
to
say
to
this
it
was
not
my
affair
unwittingly
i
had
been
the
means
of
restoring
to
the
ridsdales
their
lost
bracelet
they
must
act
as
they
thought
well
with
regard
to
the
thief
as
a
matter
of
fact
vyner
did
escape
the
full
penalty
of
his
crime
having
got
back
the
diamonds
lord
ridsdale
would
not
prosecute
on
the
contrary
he
helped
the
man
to
leave
the
country
from
the
view
of
pure
justice
he
was
of
course
wrong
but
i
could
not
help
being
glad
as
an
example
of
what
a
desperate
man
will
do
i
think
it
would
be
difficult
to
beat
vyner
story
the
originality
and
magnitude
of
the
conception
the
daring
which
enabled
the
man
to
do
his
own
dredging
in
a
submarine
boat
in
one
of
the
reaches
of
the
thames
have
seldom
been
equalled
as
i
thought
over
the
whole
scheme
my
only
regret
was
that
such
ability
should
not
have
been
devoted
to
nobler
ends
v
how
siva
spoke
during
the
summer
of
the
past
year
a
medical
friend
of
mine
sent
me
an
invitation
to
dine
with
him
and
two
of
his
at
the
welcome
club
at
the
earl
court
exhibition
one
of
our
party
was
a
certain
laurier
a
young
man
of
considerable
ability
whose
special
attention
had
been
directed
to
mental
diseases
he
was
indeed
a
noted
authority
on
this
subject
and
had
just
completed
an
appointment
at
one
of
the
large
london
asylums
during
dinner
he
entertained
us
with
a
few
of
his
late
experiences
i
assure
you
bell
he
said
there
is
absolutely
no
limit
to
the
vagaries
of
the
human
mind
at
the
present
moment
a
most
grotesque
and
painful
form
of
mental
disease
has
come
under
my
notice
the
patient
is
not
a
pauper
but
a
gentleman
of
good
standing
and
means
he
is
unmarried
and
owns
a
lovely
place
in
the
country
he
spent
the
early
years
of
his
life
in
india
and
when
there
the
craze
began
which
now
assumes
the
magnitude
of
a
monomania
pray
let
me
hear
about
him
if
your
professional
etiquette
allows
you
to
talk
on
the
subject
i
answered
i
will
certainly
tell
you
what
i
can
he
replied
i
have
known
the
man
for
years
having
met
him
in
town
on
several
occasions
last
week
his
nephew
came
to
see
me
and
spoke
seriously
with
regard
to
his
uncle
state
of
mind
his
great
craze
for
years
has
been
spiritualism
theosophy
and
mahatmas
with
all
their
attendant
he
firmly
believes
in
his
power
to
call
up
spirits
from
the
vasty
deep
and
holds
many
extraordinary
séances
but
surely
such
a
craze
is
not
sufficient
to
prove
insanity
i
said
hundreds
of
people
believe
in
such
manifestations
at
the
present
day
i
know
that
well
and
perfectly
harmless
such
crazes
are
so
long
as
the
victims
confine
their
beliefs
to
and
humbug
of
that
sort
but
when
their
convictions
lead
them
to
commit
actions
which
compromise
serious
interests
and
when
as
in
this
case
there
is
a
possibility
of
life
itself
being
in
danger
it
is
time
they
should
be
looked
after
what
is
the
particular
nature
of
your
friend
delusion
i
asked
this
he
is
practically
a
brahmin
having
been
deeply
imbued
with
the
peculiar
doctrines
of
brahminism
when
in
india
amongst
his
friends
in
the
east
was
a
brahmin
of
high
degree
in
whose
house
were
three
idols
representing
the
hindu
trinity
vishnu
brahma
and
siva
by
some
means
which
have
never
been
explained
to
me
my
friend
managed
to
get
possession
of
siva
and
brought
the
idol
home
he
placed
it
in
a
gallery
which
he
has
in
his
house
believing
from
the
first
that
it
possessed
mystical
properties
which
it
was
his
duty
to
fathom
the
nephew
now
tells
me
that
he
has
brought
his
craze
to
such
a
pass
that
he
firmly
believes
that
siva
speaks
to
him
in
hindustanee
the
unhappy
man
kneels
nightly
at
the
altar
in
front
of
the
idol
receiving
as
he
imagines
directions
from
him
the
consequence
is
that
he
does
all
sorts
of
mad
and
extraordinary
things
spending
his
large
fortune
lavishly
in
the
decoration
of
this
hideous
monster
buying
pearls
rubies
and
even
diamonds
for
the
purpose
and
really
being
as
he
imagines
guided
by
it
in
the
disposition
of
his
life
and
property
he
has
a
young
niece
residing
with
him
to
whom
he
has
always
been
very
much
attached
but
of
late
he
has
been
cruel
to
her
banishing
her
from
his
presence
refusing
her
his
sympathy
and
has
even
gone
to
the
length
of
threatening
to
take
her
life
saying
quite
openly
that
siva
informs
him
night
after
night
of
her
treachery
towards
him
now
the
nephew
is
engaged
to
this
girl
and
is
naturally
anxious
about
her
but
say
what
he
will
nothing
will
induce
her
to
turn
against
her
uncle
to
whom
she
is
deeply
attached
she
denies
that
he
threatens
her
life
although
the
nephew
declares
that
he
did
so
in
his
own
presence
under
such
circumstances
her
friends
are
naturally
most
anxious
about
her
and
feel
it
their
duty
to
get
a
medical
opinion
with
regard
to
the
uncle
i
am
going
down
to
his
place
and
shall
there
meet
his
regular
medical
attendant
in
consultation
and
then
i
suppose
certify
as
to
his
insanity
i
answered
doubtless
that
is
if
we
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
man
is
really
insane
what
an
awful
responsibility
is
reposed
in
you
doctors
i
said
think
what
it
means
to
condemn
a
man
to
a
lunatic
asylum
in
the
hands
of
the
unscrupulous
such
a
power
is
terrible
laurier
knitted
his
brows
and
looked
keenly
at
me
what
do
you
mean
he
said
in
a
curious
tone
of
course
mistakes
are
made
now
and
then
but
not
i
believe
often
to
act
in
good
faith
and
exercise
reasonable
care
are
the
two
requisites
of
the
law
of
course
i
replied
there
are
great
difficulties
on
both
sides
of
this
momentous
question
but
if
i
belonged
to
the
profession
i
can
frankly
say
that
nothing
would
induce
me
to
sign
a
certificate
of
lunacy
a
few
moments
afterwards
we
all
rose
and
strolled
about
the
grounds
as
we
were
parting
at
the
exit
gates
i
called
laurier
aside
the
love
of
mystery
is
to
me
a
ruling
passion
i
said
will
you
excuse
the
great
liberty
i
take
when
i
ask
you
to
let
me
know
the
result
of
your
visit
of
i
am
immensely
interested
in
your
spiritualist
patient
as
i
spoke
i
scribbled
my
address
on
a
card
and
handed
it
to
him
half
expecting
that
he
would
resent
my
intrusiveness
a
smile
flitted
across
his
clever
face
and
he
stood
looking
at
me
for
a
moment
under
the
glare
of
the
great
arc
lights
i
will
certainly
give
you
the
result
of
my
visit
as
you
are
so
much
interested
he
replied
we
got
into
our
respective
hansoms
and
drove
off
in
different
directions
i
had
much
to
do
and
soon
forgot
both
laurier
and
his
patient
therefore
on
the
following
monday
when
he
was
ushered
into
my
presence
my
surprise
was
great
i
have
come
to
fulfil
my
promise
he
began
i
am
here
not
only
to
satisfy
your
curiosity
about
my
patient
but
also
to
ask
your
advice
the
fact
is
the
matter
has
i
think
now
merged
more
into
your
domain
than
mine
pray
tell
me
what
has
happened
i
asked
that
is
what
i
am
about
to
do
but
first
i
must
ensure
your
absolute
confidence
and
secrecy
for
my
professional
reputation
may
be
seriously
compromised
if
it
is
known
that
i
consulted
you
i
gave
him
the
assurance
and
he
proceeded
my
patient
name
is
edward
thesiger
he
lives
in
a
place
called
the
hynde
in
somersetshire
i
went
down
as
i
had
arranged
and
was
met
at
the
station
by
his
nephew
jasper
bagwell
bagwell
is
a
thin
man
of
about
he
drove
me
over
to
the
hynde
and
i
was
there
met
by
thesiger
own
physician
dalton
dalton
and
i
each
made
a
separate
examination
of
the
patient
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
was
undoubtedly
queer
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
we
were
all
wandering
round
the
grounds
when
we
were
joined
by
the
young
girl
to
whom
bagwell
is
engaged
when
she
saw
me
she
gave
me
a
very
eager
glance
and
soon
attached
herself
to
my
side
want
to
speak
to
you
laurier
she
said
in
a
low
voice
i
managed
to
drop
behind
in
order
to
give
her
an
opportunity
know
what
you
have
come
about
she
said
do
you
think
of
my
uncle
case
am
not
prepared
to
hazard
an
opinion
i
replied
please
listen
to
something
i
have
got
to
say
jasper
bagwell
has
his
own
reasons
for
what
he
tells
you
you
do
very
wrong
to
listen
to
him
uncle
edward
is
queer
i
grant
with
regard
to
the
idol
siva
that
is
because
he
is
in
reality
a
brahmin
but
if
you
sign
a
certificate
to
the
effect
that
he
is
mad
you
will
be
making
a
very
terrible
mistake
as
she
spoke
her
lips
trembled
and
tears
filled
her
eyes
am
terribly
unhappy
about
it
all
she
continued
i
looked
at
her
earnestly
then
i
said
in
a
low
voice
me
if
i
reply
to
you
as
plainly
as
you
have
just
spoken
to
me
you
arouse
my
surprise
when
you
speak
as
you
do
of
bagwell
is
it
not
the
case
that
you
are
engaged
to
marry
him
she
gave
a
visible
start
is
the
case
she
answered
slowly
then
she
continued
speaking
with
great
emphasis
only
marry
my
cousin
because
it
is
the
one
the
one
chance
of
saving
uncle
edward
do
you
mean
i
asked
in
astonishment
wish
i
could
tell
you
but
i
dare
not
i
am
a
very
miserable
girl
there
is
foul
play
somewhere
of
that
i
am
convinced
oh
believe
me
wo
you
believe
me
to
these
extraordinary
words
i
made
a
somewhat
dubious
reply
and
she
soon
left
me
to
walk
by
her
uncle
side
late
that
evening
i
was
alone
with
the
patient
and
he
then
confided
to
me
much
which
he
had
withheld
at
first
he
spoke
about
the
years
he
had
spent
in
india
and
in
especial
alluded
to
the
brahmin
religion
he
told
me
also
that
he
now
possesses
the
idol
siva
and
has
set
it
up
in
a
marble
gallery
where
he
can
hold
his
spiritualistic
séances
bending
forward
as
he
spoke
and
fixing
me
with
his
intelligent
and
yet
strange
glance
he
said
solemnly
and
with
an
appearance
of
perfect
truth
on
his
face
that
by
certain
incenses
and
secret
incantations
he
could
make
the
idol
speak
to
him
in
hindustanee
he
said
further
that
he
felt
himself
completely
dominated
by
it
and
was
bound
to
obey
all
its
dictates
as
he
said
the
latter
words
his
face
grew
white
to
the
lips
is
exigent
in
his
demands
he
said
slowly
and
terrible
but
come
i
will
take
you
into
the
gallery
and
you
shall
see
him
for
yourself
i
went
gladly
we
had
to
go
through
a
long
conservatory
which
opened
out
of
the
from
there
we
entered
an
room
thesiger
brought
me
straight
up
to
the
idol
it
was
placed
upon
a
pedestal
it
is
a
hideous
monster
made
of
wood
and
has
five
heads
in
its
hand
it
holds
a
trident
i
could
hardly
refrain
from
smiling
when
i
first
saw
it
it
was
difficult
to
believe
that
any
man
sane
or
insane
could
hold
faith
in
such
a
monstrosity
my
object
however
was
to
draw
the
poor
mad
fellow
out
and
i
begged
of
him
to
take
what
steps
he
considered
necessary
in
order
to
induce
the
creature
to
speak
he
willingly
obeyed
my
desire
and
with
great
solemnity
went
through
elaborate
operations
then
turning
the
lamp
very
low
knelt
at
the
altar
in
front
of
the
idol
and
began
to
address
it
he
waited
for
its
replies
which
were
of
course
inaudible
and
then
continued
speaking
again
after
some
moments
spent
in
this
way
he
declared
solemnly
that
it
had
replied
to
him
and
practically
called
me
a
liar
when
i
said
i
had
not
heard
it
when
he
turned
up
the
lamp
at
the
end
of
this
strange
scene
i
noticed
for
the
first
time
that
the
idol
was
decorated
with
precious
stones
of
extraordinary
value
to
leave
such
valuables
in
a
room
with
an
unlocked
door
was
in
itself
a
symptom
of
insanity
and
when
i
parted
with
thesiger
for
the
night
i
had
not
the
least
doubt
that
my
unfortunate
host
was
really
insane
all
the
same
i
had
a
curious
unwillingness
with
regard
to
signing
the
certificate
bagwell
eagerly
asked
me
if
i
did
not
intend
to
sign
to
his
astonishment
i
replied
in
the
negative
i
said
that
the
case
was
a
very
peculiar
one
and
that
it
would
be
necessary
for
me
to
pay
a
second
visit
to
the
patient
before
i
could
take
this
extreme
step
he
was
i
could
see
intensely
annoyed
but
i
remained
firm
laurier
stopped
speaking
and
looked
me
full
in
the
face
well
i
asked
i
have
come
to
consult
with
you
over
the
matter
you
remember
what
you
said
about
the
responsibility
of
signing
such
certificates
it
is
on
account
of
those
words
i
have
come
to
you
well
laurier
i
answered
i
shall
of
course
be
happy
to
do
anything
i
can
to
help
you
but
i
must
frankly
confess
that
i
fail
to
see
exactly
on
what
point
i
can
be
of
service
i
know
little
about
disease
in
general
and
nothing
about
mental
diseases
in
particular
miss
thesiger
seems
to
think
that
there
is
foul
play
but
have
you
any
suspicions
on
your
own
account
i
have
no
proofs
but
all
the
same
i
do
suspect
foul
play
although
perhaps
i
have
no
right
to
say
so
then
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
i
asked
this
he
answered
will
you
come
down
with
me
to
somersetshire
as
my
friend
and
in
the
of
a
great
spiritualist
thesiger
will
be
only
too
delighted
to
meet
some
one
of
his
own
way
of
thinking
will
you
come
i
thought
for
a
moment
it
was
not
a
i
cared
to
assume
but
the
case
was
peculiar
and
might
possibly
lie
within
my
province
i
eventually
agreed
to
accompany
laurier
into
somersetshire
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
went
down
with
him
the
next
day
he
had
telegraphed
our
arrival
to
the
hynde
and
a
hearty
invitation
was
accorded
to
me
as
we
were
driving
through
the
grounds
late
the
following
afternoon
we
were
met
by
a
tall
girl
who
was
accompanied
by
two
thoroughbred
retrievers
here
is
miss
thesiger
said
laurier
he
called
to
the
driver
to
stop
and
jumping
down
went
to
her
side
i
accompanied
him
miss
thesiger
said
laurier
let
me
introduce
my
friend
john
bell
she
looked
me
full
in
the
face
then
her
grey
eyes
seemed
to
lighten
with
momentary
pleasure
and
she
held
out
her
hand
what
have
you
come
back
for
she
asked
the
next
moment
turning
to
laurier
to
see
your
uncle
are
you
to
meet
dr
dalton
her
lips
trembled
i
believe
so
i
assure
you
miss
thesiger
i
have
come
with
no
sinister
design
laurier
smiled
as
he
spoke
on
the
contrary
i
am
here
in
order
if
possible
to
get
at
the
truth
there
is
no
one
who
can
help
me
better
than
this
gentleman
then
you
do
suspect
foul
play
she
said
her
eyes
lighting
up
with
sudden
hope
i
have
no
reason
to
do
so
he
answered
it
exists
she
replied
i
know
what
i
am
saying
will
you
not
believe
me
as
she
spoke
she
glanced
hurriedly
behind
her
footsteps
were
heard
rapidly
approaching
there
is
my
cousin
she
said
he
follows
me
like
a
shadow
laurier
and
bell
i
must
see
you
both
or
one
of
you
in
private
i
have
something
of
great
importance
which
you
ought
to
know
before
either
of
us
could
answer
her
jasper
bagwell
came
up
he
gave
us
a
polite
welcome
and
glanced
keenly
at
his
cousin
who
took
no
notice
of
him
but
continued
her
walk
poor
girl
he
said
with
a
deep
sigh
as
we
three
walked
slowly
to
the
house
why
do
you
pity
her
i
could
not
help
asking
because
she
is
nearly
as
much
under
a
delusion
as
my
uncle
himself
the
fact
is
she
is
in
the
utmost
danger
and
yet
refuses
absolutely
to
believe
it
the
more
eccentric
my
unfortunate
uncle
grows
the
more
she
clings
to
him
she
scarcely
leaves
his
side
although
it
is
most
unsafe
for
her
to
be
with
him
i
think
it
my
absolute
duty
to
watch
her
day
and
night
and
am
really
almost
worn
out
with
anxiety
the
whole
of
last
night
i
spent
in
the
corridor
which
divides
her
room
from
thesiger
three
times
in
the
course
of
the
night
i
saw
the
unfortunate
madman
gliding
down
this
corridor
and
but
for
my
timely
appearance
on
the
scene
i
have
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
he
would
have
entered
helen
room
with
the
most
fell
design
i
see
the
madness
in
his
eye
when
he
even
glances
at
her
he
told
me
solemnly
not
later
than
yesterday
that
siva
had
laid
it
upon
him
to
take
her
life
as
she
was
opposed
heart
and
soul
to
the
doctrines
of
brahminism
and
was
a
serious
obstacle
in
the
way
of
the
great
work
which
my
uncle
was
meant
by
the
idol
to
undertake
i
told
helen
exactly
what
he
said
but
she
goes
on
as
if
nothing
were
wrong
the
fact
is
this
laurier
if
you
do
sign
that
certificate
i
must
get
another
doctor
who
will
bagwell
communications
were
certainly
alarming
but
we
had
scarcely
time
to
reply
to
them
before
we
reached
the
house
when
we
entered
the
hall
the
frown
departed
from
his
face
like
magic
he
assumed
a
thoroughly
pleasant
manner
and
conducted
us
quickly
into
the
presence
of
the
owner
of
the
house
edward
thesiger
was
a
handsome
old
man
tall
and
dignified
in
appearance
he
possessed
a
particularly
lofty
and
intelligent
cast
of
face
aquiline
features
and
silver
hair
which
flowed
down
over
his
shoulders
his
face
was
clean
shaven
which
allowed
the
handsome
curves
of
his
mobile
mouth
to
be
plainly
seen
his
conversation
betokened
the
man
of
learning
his
words
were
well
chosen
his
manner
was
extremely
calm
and
quiet
at
a
first
glance
no
one
could
look
more
thoroughly
sane
during
dinner
that
night
i
happened
to
be
seated
opposite
miss
thesiger
she
was
very
silent
and
seemed
terribly
depressed
i
noticed
that
she
often
glanced
at
her
uncle
and
further
observed
that
he
carefully
avoided
meeting
her
eyes
when
she
came
into
the
room
he
manifested
distinct
uneasiness
and
when
she
retired
to
the
after
dinner
a
look
of
relief
filled
his
fine
face
he
drew
up
his
chair
near
mine
and
began
to
talk
i
am
glad
you
were
able
to
come
he
said
it
is
not
often
one
has
the
privilege
of
meeting
a
thoroughly
kindred
spirit
now
tell
me
have
you
carefully
studied
brahminism
i
have
done
so
cursorily
i
replied
and
have
had
from
time
to
time
curious
dealings
with
the
supernatural
i
then
added
abruptly
i
am
much
interested
to
hear
from
laurier
that
you
thesiger
possess
the
idol
siva
in
this
house
hush
he
said
starting
and
turning
very
pale
do
not
say
the
name
in
such
a
loud
and
reckless
tone
as
he
spoke
he
bent
towards
me
and
his
voice
dropped
bell
i
have
extraordinary
confidences
which
i
can
make
to
you
i
shall
be
happy
to
hear
them
i
answered
have
you
had
wine
enough
shall
we
go
into
the
gallery
now
i
rose
immediately
my
host
led
me
into
a
conservatory
and
from
there
straight
into
a
marble
gallery
it
was
a
place
being
a
large
oval
chamber
forty
feet
long
the
walls
were
faced
with
marble
and
a
dado
painted
in
egyptian
style
ran
round
the
room
half
way
between
the
middle
of
the
room
and
the
end
stood
a
fountain
of
curious
design
it
consisted
of
the
bronze
figure
of
a
swan
with
wings
outspread
from
its
bill
the
water
issued
and
fell
into
a
circular
basin
facing
this
fountain
twenty
feet
away
stood
the
idol
with
its
little
altar
in
front
of
it
i
went
up
and
examined
it
with
intense
interest
the
pedestal
on
which
it
rested
was
about
three
feet
high
the
idol
itself
was
the
same
height
so
that
its
five
heads
were
almost
on
a
level
with
my
face
round
the
neck
and
decorating
each
of
the
heads
were
jewels
of
extraordinary
magnificence
the
hand
which
held
the
trident
was
loaded
with
diamond
rings
it
is
almost
impossible
to
describe
the
sinister
effect
of
this
grotesque
and
horrible
monster
and
when
i
saw
thesiger
gazing
at
it
with
a
peculiar
expression
of
reverence
not
unmixed
with
fear
i
felt
certain
that
bagwell
was
right
and
that
the
man
was
dangerously
insane
as
i
was
thinking
these
thoughts
my
host
groaned
quite
audibly
and
then
looked
steadily
at
me
i
am
living
through
a
very
terrible
time
he
said
in
a
low
voice
i
am
the
victim
of
a
strange
and
awful
power
here
his
words
dropped
to
an
intense
whisper
years
ago
when
i
became
a
brahmin
he
continued
voluntarily
giving
up
the
faith
in
which
i
was
born
i
little
knew
to
what
such
a
step
would
lead
i
stole
siva
from
the
house
of
my
indian
friend
and
brought
the
idol
home
from
the
first
it
began
to
exercise
a
marvellous
power
over
me
i
had
made
a
large
fortune
in
india
and
when
i
came
to
england
bought
this
place
and
finding
this
curious
gallery
already
in
existence
had
it
lined
with
marble
and
set
up
siva
in
its
midst
the
study
of
the
faith
which
i
had
adopted
the
holding
of
spiritualistic
séances
and
matters
of
that
sort
occupied
my
time
and
i
became
more
and
more
imbued
with
the
strange
mysticism
of
my
belief
as
the
years
flew
by
i
was
more
and
more
firmly
convinced
that
what
looks
like
mere
wood
is
in
reality
imbued
with
strange
and
awful
qualities
i
shall
never
forget
that
terrible
evening
when
siva
first
spoke
to
me
how
long
ago
was
that
i
interrupted
some
months
ago
now
i
was
kneeling
by
the
altar
and
was
speaking
to
him
as
usual
when
i
heard
words
uttered
in
hindustanee
at
first
i
could
scarcely
credit
my
own
ears
but
soon
i
grew
accustomed
to
the
fact
that
siva
wished
to
hold
communication
with
me
and
listened
to
him
nightly
at
the
beginning
of
our
remarkable
intercourse
he
laid
certain
mandates
upon
me
which
resulted
as
you
see
in
my
decorating
him
with
these
precious
stones
i
felt
bound
to
obey
him
whatever
he
dictated
but
of
late
he
has
told
me
he
has
told
me
the
old
man
began
to
shudder
and
tremble
while
he
had
been
speaking
to
me
he
had
been
gazing
at
the
idol
now
he
walked
a
few
steps
away
and
turned
his
back
on
it
sooner
or
later
i
must
obey
him
he
said
in
a
feeble
voice
but
the
thing
is
driving
me
crazed
crazed
what
is
it
i
asked
tell
me
i
beseech
you
i
can
not
it
is
too
awful
it
relates
to
the
one
i
love
best
in
the
world
the
sacrifice
is
too
horrible
and
yet
i
am
drawn
to
it
i
am
drawn
to
the
performing
of
an
awful
deed
by
a
terrific
power
ask
me
no
more
bell
i
see
by
your
face
that
i
have
your
pity
you
have
truly
i
answered
i
had
scarcely
said
the
last
words
before
the
door
of
the
gallery
was
opened
and
miss
thesiger
bagwell
and
laurier
appeared
miss
thesiger
went
straight
to
her
uncle
side
and
laid
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
must
you
stay
up
any
longer
she
asked
in
a
gentle
voice
i
heard
you
walking
about
last
night
you
were
restless
and
did
not
sleep
do
go
to
bed
now
you
seem
so
tired
i
know
these
gentlemen
will
excuse
you
she
added
glancing
from
laurier
to
me
certainly
said
laurier
i
should
recommend
thesiger
to
retire
at
once
he
looks
quite
worn
out
i
shall
go
presently
presently
said
thesiger
in
a
somewhat
curt
voice
leave
us
helen
there
a
good
child
go
my
dear
go
helen
do
irritate
him
i
heard
bagwell
say
she
gave
a
quick
despairing
glance
from
one
man
to
the
other
then
turning
left
the
room
and
now
thesiger
i
said
will
you
not
grant
me
the
favour
of
a
séance
thesiger
remained
gravely
silent
for
a
moment
then
he
said
by
virtue
of
your
power
as
a
medium
you
may
be
able
to
hear
the
voice
and
so
convince
laurier
of
its
reality
illustration
it
was
the
strangest
scene
i
ever
witnessed
a
master
of
page
he
then
proceeded
to
go
through
some
elaborate
operations
and
finally
kneeling
at
the
altar
began
to
speak
hindustanee
it
was
about
the
strangest
scene
i
had
ever
witnessed
and
though
i
stood
almost
at
his
elbow
i
could
hear
no
sound
whatever
but
his
own
voice
siva
will
not
speak
he
said
rising
there
must
be
some
one
here
whose
influence
is
adverse
i
can
not
hear
him
it
is
strange
he
looked
puzzled
and
more
relieved
than
otherwise
you
will
go
to
bed
now
sir
said
bagwell
you
look
very
tired
i
am
he
replied
i
will
leave
my
friends
with
you
jasper
you
will
see
that
they
have
all
they
want
he
bade
laurier
and
me
a
courteous
nodded
to
his
nephew
and
left
the
room
this
is
the
most
extraordinary
phase
of
mental
delusion
i
ever
heard
of
i
said
if
you
will
permit
me
bagwell
i
will
examine
this
idol
more
particularly
you
can
do
so
if
you
please
he
said
but
he
did
not
speak
in
a
cordial
tone
examine
it
to
your
heart
content
he
continued
a
moment
later
only
pray
do
disarrange
it
he
seems
to
know
by
instinct
if
it
is
touched
bah
it
is
sickening
shall
we
go
into
another
room
gentlemen
watching
his
face
carefully
i
resolved
to
make
my
examination
in
private
and
now
followed
him
into
the
we
stayed
there
for
a
short
time
talking
in
a
desultory
manner
and
soon
afterwards
retired
for
the
night
on
my
a
note
awaited
me
i
opened
it
hastily
and
saw
to
my
surprise
that
it
was
from
miss
thesiger
i
could
not
get
the
opportunity
i
needed
she
wrote
but
will
you
meet
me
in
the
laurel
walk
morning
at
five
i
tore
up
the
letter
after
reading
it
and
soon
afterwards
got
into
bed
i
must
confess
that
i
slept
badly
that
night
i
felt
worried
and
anxious
there
was
not
the
least
doubt
that
thesiger
was
mad
it
was
all
too
apparent
that
his
madness
was
daily
and
hourly
assuming
a
more
and
more
dangerous
form
the
affectionate
girl
who
clung
to
him
ought
undoubtedly
to
be
removed
from
his
neighbourhood
at
the
hour
named
by
miss
thesiger
i
rose
dressed
and
stole
downstairs
through
the
silent
house
i
found
her
as
she
had
indicated
in
the
laurel
walk
how
good
of
you
to
come
she
said
but
we
must
not
talk
here
it
would
not
be
safe
what
do
you
mean
i
answered
no
one
can
possibly
watch
us
at
this
hour
jasper
may
be
about
she
said
as
far
as
i
can
tell
he
seems
never
to
sleep
i
believe
he
paces
outside
my
room
the
greater
part
of
the
night
you
can
scarcely
blame
him
for
that
i
said
he
does
it
in
order
to
ensure
your
safety
she
gave
me
an
impatient
glance
i
see
he
has
been
talking
to
you
she
replied
but
now
it
is
necessary
for
you
to
hear
my
side
of
the
story
come
into
this
he
will
never
guess
that
we
are
here
turning
abruptly
she
led
the
way
into
a
small
tastefully
arranged
shutting
the
door
behind
her
she
turned
at
once
and
faced
me
now
she
said
in
an
eager
voice
i
will
tell
you
everything
there
is
an
unexplained
mystery
about
all
this
and
i
am
convinced
that
jasper
is
at
the
bottom
of
it
what
do
you
mean
i
asked
i
have
nothing
whatever
but
a
woman
intuition
to
guide
me
but
all
the
same
i
am
convinced
of
what
i
am
saying
before
jasper
came
home
uncle
edward
was
a
brahmin
beyond
doubt
his
séances
were
intensely
disagreeable
to
me
and
i
took
care
never
to
witness
them
nor
to
speak
to
him
on
the
terrible
subject
of
siva
but
beyond
the
fact
that
he
was
a
brahmin
deeply
imbued
with
the
mysteries
of
his
religion
he
was
a
perfectly
sane
happy
intelligent
and
affectionate
man
he
loved
me
devotedly
as
i
am
the
child
of
his
favourite
brother
and
told
me
just
before
jasper
arrival
that
he
had
made
me
his
heiress
leaving
me
all
that
he
possessed
in
the
world
he
had
never
liked
jasper
and
was
annoyed
when
he
came
here
and
made
this
house
his
headquarters
i
had
not
met
my
cousin
since
i
was
a
little
child
and
when
he
arrived
on
the
scene
took
a
great
dislike
to
him
he
began
at
once
to
pay
me
hateful
attentions
and
to
question
me
eagerly
with
regard
to
uncle
edward
and
his
ways
by
a
curious
coincidence
he
had
known
this
house
before
he
went
to
india
having
stayed
here
as
a
boy
he
showed
particular
interest
in
the
oval
gallery
and
encouraged
uncle
edward
to
talk
of
siva
although
he
saw
that
the
subject
excited
him
considerably
jasper
had
been
about
a
fortnight
in
the
house
when
my
poor
uncle
made
as
he
considered
the
astounding
discovery
that
siva
could
speak
to
him
i
shall
never
forget
the
first
day
when
he
told
me
of
this
the
sparkle
in
his
eyes
the
tremble
of
his
hands
the
nervous
energy
which
seemed
to
animate
him
from
that
hour
day
by
day
came
the
gradual
diminution
of
strength
both
of
mind
and
body
the
loss
of
appetite
the
feverish
touch
all
these
things
puzzled
and
distressed
me
but
i
could
not
bear
to
confide
my
fears
to
jasper
these
things
went
on
for
over
a
month
and
uncle
edward
certainly
deteriorated
in
every
way
he
spent
the
greater
part
of
both
day
and
night
in
the
gallery
begging
of
me
to
come
with
him
imploring
me
to
listen
for
the
voice
during
that
month
he
spent
a
large
fortune
in
precious
stones
for
siva
showing
them
to
me
first
before
he
decorated
the
hideous
thing
with
them
i
felt
wild
with
misery
and
all
the
time
jasper
was
here
watching
and
watching
at
the
end
of
the
first
month
there
came
a
distinct
change
uncle
edward
who
had
been
devoted
to
me
up
to
then
began
to
show
a
new
attitude
he
now
began
to
dislike
to
have
me
in
his
presence
often
asking
me
as
a
special
favour
to
leave
the
room
one
day
he
said
to
me
you
keep
your
door
locked
at
night
i
laughed
when
he
spoke
not
i
answered
wish
you
would
do
so
he
said
very
earnestly
you
as
a
personal
favour
to
me
jasper
was
in
the
room
when
he
spoke
i
saw
a
queer
light
flashing
through
his
eyes
and
then
he
bent
over
his
book
as
if
he
had
not
heard
a
special
favour
to
me
keep
your
door
locked
helen
said
uncle
edward
i
made
him
a
soothing
answer
and
pretended
to
assent
of
course
i
never
locked
my
door
then
jasper
began
to
talk
to
me
he
said
that
uncle
edward
was
not
only
mad
but
that
his
mania
was
assuming
a
terrible
form
and
against
me
he
said
that
my
life
was
in
danger
he
thought
to
frighten
me
little
he
knew
here
the
brave
girl
drew
herself
up
indignation
sweeping
over
her
face
and
filling
her
eyes
i
told
him
i
did
not
believe
a
word
of
what
he
said
i
declared
that
uncle
edward
could
not
hate
me
is
he
not
the
one
i
love
best
in
the
world
jasper
grew
very
angry
here
helen
he
said
know
enough
to
lock
him
up
lock
him
up
in
a
lunatic
asylum
i
cried
he
answered
have
only
to
get
two
doctors
to
certify
to
the
fact
of
his
insanity
and
the
deed
is
done
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
do
it
could
never
be
so
cruel
i
replied
of
his
grey
hairs
jasper
i
pleaded
is
the
dearest
to
me
in
all
the
world
you
could
not
take
his
liberty
away
do
just
respect
his
one
little
craze
believe
me
he
is
not
really
mad
go
away
if
you
are
afraid
of
him
i
am
not
oh
why
do
you
leave
us
both
in
peace
dare
not
he
answered
love
you
and
i
am
determined
you
shall
marry
me
engage
yourself
to
me
at
once
and
i
will
do
nothing
to
take
away
uncle
edward
liberty
for
at
least
a
month
i
struggled
against
this
horrible
wish
of
my
cousin
but
in
the
end
i
yielded
to
it
i
became
engaged
to
him
secretly
for
he
did
not
wish
uncle
edward
to
know
i
knew
of
course
why
he
wished
to
marry
me
he
had
heard
that
i
am
some
day
to
inherit
my
uncle
wealth
jasper
himself
is
a
very
poor
man
now
bell
you
know
everything
things
get
worse
and
worse
and
at
times
i
am
almost
inclined
to
believe
that
my
life
is
in
some
danger
a
fiend
has
taken
possession
of
the
uncle
whose
heart
was
so
warm
and
loving
ah
it
is
fearful
i
do
not
believe
a
bitterer
trial
could
be
given
to
any
girl
it
is
too
awful
to
feel
that
the
one
she
loves
best
in
all
the
world
has
changed
in
his
feelings
towards
her
it
is
not
so
much
the
sacrifice
of
my
poor
life
i
mind
as
the
feeling
that
things
are
so
bitterly
altered
with
him
jasper
put
an
alternative
to
me
last
night
either
i
am
to
marry
him
within
a
week
or
i
am
to
use
my
influence
to
induce
laurier
to
sign
the
certificate
if
i
accept
neither
proposal
he
will
get
down
two
other
doctors
from
london
for
the
purpose
what
have
you
decided
to
do
i
asked
i
will
marry
jasper
yes
within
a
week
i
shall
be
his
wife
unless
something
happens
to
show
us
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
fearful
mystery
for
i
can
not
never
never
can
i
deprive
uncle
edward
of
his
liberty
i
am
glad
you
have
confided
in
me
i
said
after
a
pause
and
i
will
do
my
utmost
for
you
when
did
you
say
that
your
uncle
first
heard
the
idol
speak
two
or
three
months
ago
now
soon
after
jasper
came
home
bell
is
there
any
chance
of
your
being
able
to
help
me
i
will
promise
to
do
my
utmost
but
just
at
present
i
can
see
no
special
light
by
the
way
would
it
not
be
well
for
you
to
leave
the
hynde
for
a
short
time
no
i
am
not
at
all
afraid
i
can
take
care
of
myself
it
is
not
my
dear
uncle
whom
i
fear
it
is
jasper
soon
afterwards
she
left
me
and
as
it
was
still
quite
early
and
the
servants
were
not
yet
even
up
i
considered
that
an
excellent
opportunity
had
occurred
for
examining
the
idol
i
made
my
way
to
the
gallery
and
softly
opening
the
door
stole
in
the
bright
sunlight
which
was
now
flooding
the
chamber
seemed
to
rob
the
grotesque
old
idol
of
half
its
terrors
and
i
made
up
my
mind
not
to
leave
a
stone
unturned
to
discover
if
any
foul
play
in
connection
with
it
could
possibly
be
perpetrated
but
the
impossibility
of
such
being
the
case
seemed
more
and
more
evident
as
i
went
on
with
my
search
only
a
pigmy
could
be
secreted
inside
the
idol
there
was
no
vulgar
form
of
deception
possible
on
the
lines
for
instance
of
the
ancient
priests
of
pompeii
who
conducted
a
to
an
idol
mouth
siva
was
not
even
standing
by
the
wall
thus
precluding
the
possibility
of
the
sounds
being
conducted
on
the
plan
of
a
whispering
gallery
no
i
was
against
my
own
will
forced
to
the
absolute
conviction
that
the
voice
was
an
hallucination
of
the
diseased
mind
of
edward
thesiger
i
was
just
going
to
abandon
my
investigations
and
return
to
my
own
room
when
more
by
chance
than
design
i
knelt
down
for
a
moment
at
the
little
altar
as
i
was
about
to
rise
i
noticed
something
rather
odd
i
listened
attentively
it
was
certainly
remarkable
as
i
knelt
i
could
just
hear
a
low
continuous
hissing
sound
directly
i
moved
away
it
ceased
as
i
tried
it
several
times
with
the
same
invariable
result
i
became
seriously
puzzled
to
account
for
it
what
devilry
could
be
at
work
to
produce
this
was
it
possible
that
some
one
was
playing
a
trick
on
and
if
so
by
what
means
i
glanced
rapidly
round
and
as
i
did
so
a
mad
thought
struck
me
i
hurried
across
to
the
fountain
and
put
my
ear
close
to
the
mouth
from
which
a
tiny
jet
of
water
was
issuing
the
low
scarcely
audible
noise
that
the
water
made
as
it
flowed
out
through
the
bill
was
exactly
the
same
sound
i
had
heard
nearly
twenty
feet
away
at
the
altar
the
enormity
of
the
situation
stunned
me
for
a
moment
then
gradually
piece
by
piece
the
plot
revealed
itself
the
shape
of
the
gallery
was
a
true
oval
a
geometrical
ellipse
the
extraordinary
acoustic
properties
of
which
i
knew
well
this
peculiarly
shaped
gallery
contained
two
foci
one
towards
each
end
and
the
nature
of
the
curve
of
the
walls
was
such
that
sound
issuing
from
either
focus
was
directed
by
reflection
at
various
points
to
the
other
focus
and
to
the
other
focus
alone
even
across
an
enormous
distance
between
such
would
be
the
case
the
swan
mouth
was
evidently
at
one
focus
the
position
of
a
man
head
as
he
knelt
at
the
altar
would
be
without
the
slightest
doubt
at
the
other
could
the
pipe
be
used
as
a
when
the
water
was
turned
off
i
felt
so
excited
by
this
extraordinary
discovery
that
it
was
only
with
an
effort
that
i
maintained
my
i
knew
that
presence
of
mind
was
absolutely
necessary
in
order
to
expose
this
horrible
scheme
i
left
the
gallery
and
passed
through
the
conservatory
here
i
found
the
gardener
arranging
some
pots
i
chatted
to
him
for
a
few
moments
he
looked
surprised
at
seeing
me
up
at
such
an
unusual
hour
can
you
tell
me
how
the
fountain
in
the
gallery
is
turned
on
or
off
i
asked
yes
i
can
sir
he
replied
the
pipe
runs
along
outside
this
stand
and
here
the
tap
i
went
across
and
looked
at
it
in
the
leaden
pipe
that
was
fastened
to
the
wall
were
two
nuts
which
could
be
turned
by
a
small
spanner
and
between
them
was
a
brass
cap
which
fitted
on
to
a
circular
outlet
from
the
pipe
what
is
this
used
for
i
asked
pointing
to
the
little
outlet
which
was
closed
by
the
cap
we
screw
the
hose
on
there
sir
to
water
the
flowers
i
see
i
answered
so
when
you
use
the
hose
you
shut
off
the
water
from
the
fountain
in
the
gallery
that
it
sir
and
a
wonderful
deal
of
trouble
it
saves
why
it
was
never
done
before
i
ca
think
when
was
it
done
then
i
asked
my
heart
was
beating
fast
it
was
bagwell
thought
sir
he
had
it
fixed
on
soon
after
he
came
he
wanted
to
have
plenty
of
water
handy
in
order
to
water
the
plants
he
brought
back
from
india
but
lor
sir
they
never
live
through
the
winter
even
under
glass
i
waited
to
hear
no
more
the
whole
infernal
plot
was
laid
bare
the
second
tap
which
shut
off
the
water
both
from
the
fountain
and
the
hose
pipe
was
of
course
quite
useless
except
for
bagwell
evil
purpose
i
hurried
straight
up
to
laurier
room
he
was
just
preparing
to
rise
his
astonishment
when
i
told
him
of
my
discovery
was
beyond
words
then
by
shutting
off
the
water
and
applying
his
mouth
to
the
place
where
the
hose
is
fixed
on
he
could
convey
his
voice
to
the
mouth
like
an
ordinary
which
owing
to
the
peculiar
construction
of
the
gallery
would
be
carried
across
to
the
other
focus
at
the
altar
he
said
exactly
i
replied
and
now
laurier
you
must
please
allow
me
to
regulate
our
future
plans
they
simply
these
you
must
tell
bagwell
that
you
absolutely
refuse
to
sign
the
certificate
unless
thesiger
declares
that
he
hears
the
voice
again
in
your
presence
and
arrange
that
the
séance
takes
place
at
nine
i
in
the
meantime
shall
ostensibly
take
my
departure
and
so
leave
the
ground
clear
for
bagwell
he
is
evidently
rather
afraid
of
me
my
going
will
throw
him
completely
off
his
guard
but
i
shall
in
reality
only
leave
the
train
at
the
next
station
and
return
here
after
dark
you
will
have
to
see
that
the
conservatory
door
leading
on
to
the
terrace
is
left
unlocked
i
shall
steal
in
and
hiding
myself
in
the
conservatory
shall
await
bagwell
you
in
the
meantime
will
be
in
the
gallery
with
thesiger
when
you
hear
me
call
out
come
in
at
once
our
only
hope
is
to
take
that
wretch
to
this
hastily
constructed
scheme
laurier
instantly
agreed
and
at
four
that
afternoon
i
took
my
leave
miss
thesiger
looking
white
and
miserable
standing
on
the
steps
to
see
me
off
bagwell
drove
me
himself
to
the
station
and
bade
me
with
a
heartiness
which
was
at
least
sincere
i
was
back
again
at
the
hynde
at
eight
that
evening
laurier
had
left
the
conservatory
door
unlocked
and
slipping
in
it
being
now
quite
dark
i
hid
myself
behind
some
large
flowering
shrubs
and
waited
presently
i
heard
the
door
of
the
conservatory
open
and
in
stole
bagwell
i
saw
him
approach
the
pipe
turn
the
spanner
which
shut
off
the
water
from
the
fountain
and
also
from
the
hose
pipe
and
then
proceed
to
unscrew
the
brass
cap
i
waited
till
i
saw
him
place
his
mouth
to
the
opening
and
begin
to
speak
and
then
i
dashed
out
upon
him
and
called
loudly
for
laurier
bagwell
surprise
and
terror
at
my
unexpected
attack
absolutely
bereft
him
of
speech
and
he
stood
gazing
at
me
with
a
mixed
expression
of
fury
and
fear
the
next
minute
laurier
and
thesiger
both
burst
in
from
the
gallery
i
still
retained
my
hold
of
bagwell
the
moment
i
saw
the
sign
i
went
up
to
him
and
in
a
few
words
explained
the
whole
fraud
but
it
was
not
until
i
had
demonstrated
the
trick
in
the
oval
gallery
that
he
became
convinced
then
the
relief
on
his
face
was
marvellous
you
leave
my
house
at
once
he
said
to
bagwell
go
sir
if
you
do
not
wish
to
be
in
the
hands
of
the
police
where
is
helen
where
is
my
child
he
had
scarcely
said
the
words
and
bagwell
was
just
slinking
off
with
a
white
face
like
a
whipped
cur
towards
the
door
when
helen
appeared
upon
the
scene
what
is
it
she
cried
is
anything
the
matter
the
old
man
strode
up
to
her
he
took
her
in
his
arms
it
is
all
right
helen
he
said
all
right
i
can
never
explain
but
take
my
word
it
is
all
right
i
was
a
fool
and
worse
nay
i
was
mad
but
i
am
sane
now
bell
i
can
never
express
my
obligations
to
you
but
now
will
you
do
one
thing
more
what
is
that
be
assured
i
will
do
anything
in
my
power
i
answered
then
return
here
and
destroy
siva
how
i
could
have
been
infatuated
enough
to
believe
in
that
senseless
piece
of
wood
is
beyond
my
power
to
understand
but
destroy
it
sir
take
it
away
let
me
never
lay
eyes
on
it
again
early
on
the
following
morning
when
i
was
leaving
the
house
bagwell
who
must
have
been
waiting
for
the
purpose
suddenly
stepped
across
my
path
i
have
a
word
of
explanation
to
give
he
said
you
bell
have
won
and
i
have
lost
i
played
a
deep
game
and
for
a
large
cause
it
did
not
occur
to
me
as
possible
that
any
one
could
discover
the
means
by
which
i
made
siva
speak
i
am
now
about
to
leave
england
for
ever
but
before
i
do
so
it
may
interest
you
to
know
that
the
temptation
offered
to
me
was
a
very
peculiar
and
strong
one
i
had
not
been
an
hour
at
the
hynde
before
i
suddenly
remembered
having
spent
some
months
in
the
old
house
when
a
boy
i
recollected
the
oval
gallery
its
peculiar
acoustic
qualities
had
been
pointed
out
to
me
by
a
scientist
who
happened
to
live
there
at
the
time
the
desire
to
win
not
helen
but
my
property
was
too
strong
to
be
resisted
by
a
penniless
man
my
object
was
to
terrify
thesiger
whose
brain
was
already
nearly
overbalanced
into
complete
insanity
get
him
locked
up
and
marry
helen
how
i
succeeded
and
in
the
end
failed
you
know
well
vi
to
prove
an
alibi
i
first
met
arthur
cressley
in
the
late
spring
of
i
had
been
spending
the
winter
in
egypt
and
was
returning
to
liverpool
one
calm
evening
about
eleven
while
we
were
still
in
the
mediterranean
i
went
on
deck
to
smoke
a
final
cigar
before
turning
in
after
pacing
up
and
down
for
a
time
i
leant
over
the
and
began
idly
watching
the
tiny
wavelets
with
their
crests
of
white
fire
as
they
rippled
away
from
the
vessel
side
presently
i
became
aware
of
some
one
standing
near
me
and
turning
saw
that
it
was
one
of
my
a
young
man
whose
name
i
knew
but
whose
acquaintance
i
had
not
yet
made
he
was
entered
in
the
passenger
list
as
arthur
cressley
belonged
to
an
old
family
in
derbyshire
and
was
returning
home
from
western
australia
where
he
had
made
a
lot
of
money
i
offered
him
a
light
and
after
a
few
preliminary
remarks
we
drifted
into
a
desultory
conversation
he
told
me
that
he
had
been
in
australia
for
fifteen
years
and
having
done
well
was
now
returning
to
settle
in
his
native
land
then
you
do
not
intend
going
out
again
i
asked
no
he
replied
i
would
not
go
through
the
last
fifteen
years
for
double
the
money
i
have
made
i
suppose
you
will
make
london
your
headquarters
not
altogether
but
i
shall
have
to
spend
a
good
deal
of
time
there
my
wish
is
for
a
quiet
country
life
and
i
intend
to
take
over
the
old
family
property
we
have
a
place
called
cressley
hall
in
derbyshire
which
has
belonged
to
us
for
centuries
it
would
be
a
sort
of
white
elephant
for
it
has
fallen
into
pitiable
decay
but
luckily
i
am
now
in
a
position
to
restore
it
and
set
it
going
again
in
renewed
prosperity
you
are
a
fortunate
man
i
answered
perhaps
i
am
he
replied
yes
as
far
as
this
world
goods
go
i
suppose
i
am
lucky
considering
that
i
arrived
in
australia
fifteen
years
ago
with
practically
no
money
in
my
pocket
i
shall
be
glad
to
be
home
again
for
many
reasons
chiefly
because
i
can
save
the
old
property
from
being
sold
it
is
always
a
pity
when
a
fine
old
family
seat
has
to
go
to
the
hammer
for
want
of
funds
i
remarked
that
is
true
and
cressley
hall
is
a
superb
old
place
there
is
only
one
drawback
to
it
but
i
do
believe
there
is
anything
in
that
added
cressley
in
a
musing
tone
knowing
him
so
little
i
did
not
feel
justified
in
asking
for
an
explanation
i
waited
therefore
without
speaking
he
soon
proceeded
i
suppose
i
am
rather
foolish
about
it
he
continued
but
if
i
am
superstitious
i
have
abundant
reason
for
more
than
a
century
and
a
half
there
has
been
a
strange
fatality
about
any
cressley
occupying
the
hall
this
fatality
was
first
exhibited
in
when
barrington
cressley
one
of
the
most
abandoned
libertines
of
that
time
led
his
infamous
orgies
there
of
these
even
history
takes
note
there
are
endless
legends
as
to
their
nature
one
of
which
is
that
he
had
personal
dealings
with
the
devil
in
the
large
turret
room
the
principal
bedroom
at
the
hall
and
was
found
dead
there
on
the
following
morning
certainly
since
that
date
a
curious
doom
has
hung
over
the
family
and
this
doom
shows
itself
in
a
strange
way
only
attacking
those
victims
who
are
so
unfortunate
as
to
sleep
in
the
turret
room
gilbert
cressley
the
young
court
favourite
of
george
the
third
was
found
mysteriously
murdered
there
and
my
own
paid
the
penalty
by
losing
his
reason
within
those
gloomy
walls
if
the
room
has
such
an
evil
reputation
i
wonder
that
it
is
occupied
i
replied
it
happens
to
be
far
and
away
the
best
bedroom
in
the
house
and
people
always
laugh
at
that
sort
of
thing
until
they
are
brought
face
to
face
with
it
the
owner
of
the
property
is
not
only
born
there
as
a
rule
but
also
breathes
his
last
in
the
old
the
most
extraordinary
wonderful
old
bedstead
you
ever
laid
eyes
on
of
course
i
do
not
believe
in
any
malevolent
influences
from
the
unseen
world
but
the
record
of
disastrous
coincidences
in
that
one
room
is
to
say
the
least
of
it
curious
not
that
this
sort
of
thing
will
deter
me
from
going
into
possession
and
i
intend
to
put
a
lot
of
money
into
cressley
hall
has
no
one
been
occupying
it
lately
i
asked
not
recently
an
old
housekeeper
has
had
charge
of
the
place
for
the
last
few
years
the
agent
had
orders
to
sell
the
hall
long
ago
but
though
it
has
been
in
the
market
for
a
long
time
i
do
not
believe
there
was
a
single
offer
just
before
i
left
australia
i
wired
to
murdock
my
agent
that
i
intended
taking
over
the
place
and
authorised
its
withdrawal
from
the
market
have
you
no
relations
i
inquired
none
at
all
since
i
have
been
away
my
only
brother
died
it
is
curious
to
call
it
going
home
when
one
has
no
relatives
and
only
friends
who
have
probably
forgotten
one
i
could
not
help
feeling
sorry
for
cressley
as
he
described
the
lonely
outlook
of
course
with
heaps
of
money
and
an
old
family
place
he
would
soon
make
new
friends
but
he
looked
the
sort
of
chap
who
might
be
imposed
upon
and
although
he
was
as
nice
a
fellow
as
i
had
ever
met
i
could
not
help
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
he
was
not
specially
strong
either
mentally
or
physically
he
was
essentially
however
and
had
the
indescribable
bearing
of
a
man
of
old
family
i
wondered
how
he
had
managed
to
make
his
money
what
he
told
me
about
his
old
hall
also
excited
my
interest
and
as
we
talked
i
managed
to
allude
to
my
own
peculiar
hobby
and
the
delight
i
took
in
such
old
legends
as
the
voyage
flew
by
our
acquaintance
grew
apace
ripening
into
a
warm
friendship
cressley
told
me
much
of
his
past
life
and
finally
confided
to
me
one
of
his
real
objects
in
returning
to
england
while
prospecting
up
country
he
had
come
across
some
rich
veins
of
gold
and
now
his
intention
was
to
bring
out
a
large
syndicate
in
order
to
acquire
the
whole
property
which
he
anticipated
was
worth
at
least
a
million
he
spoke
confidently
of
this
great
scheme
but
always
wound
up
by
informing
me
that
the
money
which
he
hoped
to
make
was
only
of
interest
to
him
for
the
purpose
of
cressley
hall
in
its
ancient
splendour
as
we
talked
i
noticed
once
or
twice
that
a
man
stood
near
us
who
seemed
to
take
an
interest
in
our
conversation
he
was
a
thickly
set
individual
with
a
florid
complexion
and
a
broad
german
cast
of
face
he
was
an
inveterate
smoker
and
when
he
stood
near
us
with
a
pipe
in
his
mouth
the
expression
of
his
face
was
almost
a
blank
but
watching
him
closely
i
saw
a
look
in
his
eyes
which
betokened
the
shrewd
man
of
business
and
i
could
scarcely
tell
why
but
i
felt
uncomfortable
in
his
presence
this
man
wickham
by
name
managed
to
pick
up
an
acquaintance
with
cressley
and
soon
they
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
together
they
made
a
contrast
as
they
paced
up
and
down
on
deck
or
played
cards
in
the
evening
the
englishman
being
slight
and
almost
fragile
in
build
the
german
of
the
bulldog
order
with
a
manner
at
once
curt
and
overbearing
i
took
a
dislike
to
wickham
and
wondered
what
cressley
could
see
in
him
who
is
the
fellow
i
asked
on
one
occasion
linking
my
hand
in
cressley
arm
and
drawing
him
aside
as
i
spoke
do
you
mean
wickham
he
answered
i
am
sure
i
can
not
tell
you
i
never
met
the
chap
before
this
voyage
he
came
on
board
at
king
sound
where
i
also
embarked
but
he
never
spoke
to
me
until
we
were
in
the
mediterranean
on
the
whole
bell
i
am
inclined
to
like
him
he
seems
to
be
downright
and
honest
he
knows
a
great
deal
about
the
bush
too
as
he
has
spent
several
years
there
illustration
they
made
a
contrast
a
master
of
page
and
he
gives
you
the
benefit
of
his
information
i
asked
i
do
suppose
he
knows
more
than
i
do
and
it
is
doubtful
whether
he
has
had
so
rough
a
time
then
in
that
case
he
picks
your
brains
what
do
you
mean
the
young
fellow
looked
at
me
with
those
clear
grey
eyes
which
were
his
most
attractive
feature
nothing
i
answered
nothing
only
if
you
will
be
guided
by
a
man
nearly
double
your
age
i
would
take
care
to
tell
wickham
as
little
as
possible
have
you
ever
observed
that
he
happens
to
be
about
when
you
and
i
are
engaged
in
serious
conversation
i
ca
say
that
i
have
well
keep
your
eyes
open
and
you
see
what
i
mean
be
as
friendly
as
you
like
but
do
give
him
your
confidence
that
is
all
you
are
rather
late
in
advising
me
on
that
score
said
cressley
with
a
somewhat
nervous
laugh
wickham
knows
all
about
the
old
hall
by
this
time
and
your
superstitious
fears
with
regard
to
the
turret
room
i
queried
well
i
have
hinted
at
them
you
will
be
surprised
but
he
is
full
of
sympathy
tell
him
no
more
i
said
in
conclusion
cressley
made
a
sort
of
but
looked
as
if
he
rather
resented
my
interference
a
day
or
two
later
we
reached
liverpool
i
was
engaged
long
ago
to
stay
with
some
friends
in
the
suburbs
and
cressley
took
up
his
abode
at
the
prince
hotel
his
property
was
some
sixty
miles
away
and
when
we
parted
he
insisted
on
my
agreeing
to
come
down
and
see
his
place
as
soon
as
he
had
put
things
a
little
straight
i
readily
promised
to
do
so
provided
we
could
arrange
a
visit
before
my
return
to
london
nearly
a
week
went
by
and
i
saw
nothing
of
cressley
then
on
a
certain
morning
he
called
to
see
me
how
are
you
getting
on
i
asked
capitally
he
replied
i
have
been
down
to
the
hall
several
times
with
my
agent
murdock
and
though
the
place
is
in
the
most
shocking
condition
i
shall
soon
put
things
in
order
but
what
i
have
come
specially
to
ask
you
now
is
whether
you
can
get
away
and
come
with
me
to
the
hall
for
a
couple
of
nights
i
had
arranged
with
the
agent
to
go
down
this
afternoon
in
his
company
but
he
has
been
suddenly
taken
ill
he
is
rather
bad
i
believe
and
can
not
possibly
come
with
me
he
has
ordered
the
housekeeper
to
get
a
couple
of
rooms
ready
and
though
i
am
afraid
it
will
be
rather
roughing
it
i
shall
be
awfully
glad
if
you
can
come
i
had
arranged
to
meet
a
man
in
london
on
special
business
that
very
evening
and
could
not
put
him
off
but
my
irresistible
desire
to
see
the
old
place
from
the
description
i
had
heard
of
it
decided
me
to
make
an
effort
to
fall
in
as
well
as
i
could
with
cressley
plans
i
wish
i
could
go
with
you
i
said
but
that
as
it
happens
is
out
of
the
question
i
must
run
up
to
town
on
some
pressing
business
but
if
you
will
allow
me
i
can
easily
come
back
again
can
you
not
put
off
your
visit
until
evening
no
i
am
afraid
i
can
not
do
that
i
have
to
meet
several
of
the
tenants
and
have
made
all
arrangements
to
go
by
the
five
train
this
afternoon
he
looked
depressed
at
my
refusal
and
after
a
moment
said
thoughtfully
i
wish
you
could
have
come
with
me
when
murdock
could
not
come
i
thought
of
you
at
once
it
would
have
made
all
the
difference
i
am
sorry
i
replied
but
i
can
promise
faithfully
to
be
with
you
i
shall
enjoy
seeing
your
wonderful
old
hall
beyond
anything
and
as
to
roughing
it
i
am
used
to
that
you
will
not
mind
spending
one
night
there
by
yourself
he
looked
at
me
as
if
he
were
about
to
speak
but
no
words
came
from
his
lips
what
is
the
matter
i
said
giving
him
an
earnest
glance
by
the
way
are
you
going
to
sleep
in
the
turret
room
i
am
afraid
there
is
no
help
for
it
the
housekeeper
is
certain
to
get
it
ready
for
me
the
owner
of
the
property
always
sleeps
there
and
it
would
look
like
a
confession
of
weakness
to
ask
to
be
put
into
another
bedroom
nevertheless
if
you
are
nervous
i
should
not
mind
that
i
said
oh
i
do
know
that
i
am
absolutely
nervous
bell
but
all
the
same
i
have
a
superstition
at
the
present
moment
i
have
the
queerest
sensation
i
feel
as
if
i
ought
not
to
pay
this
visit
to
the
hall
if
you
intend
to
live
there
you
must
get
over
this
sort
of
thing
i
remarked
oh
yes
i
must
and
i
would
not
yield
to
it
on
any
account
whatever
i
am
sorry
i
even
mentioned
it
to
you
it
is
good
of
you
to
promise
to
come
and
i
shall
look
forward
to
seeing
you
by
what
train
will
you
come
we
looked
up
the
local
and
i
decided
on
a
train
which
would
leave
liverpool
about
five
the
very
one
that
i
shall
go
down
by
said
cressley
capital
i
meet
you
with
a
conveyance
of
some
sort
and
drive
you
over
the
house
is
a
good
two
hours
drive
from
the
station
and
you
can
not
get
a
trap
there
for
love
or
money
by
the
way
i
said
is
there
much
the
matter
with
your
agent
i
can
not
tell
you
he
seems
bad
enough
i
went
up
to
his
house
this
morning
and
saw
the
wife
it
appears
that
he
was
suddenly
taken
ill
with
a
sort
of
asthmatic
attack
to
which
he
is
subject
while
i
was
talking
to
murdock
a
messenger
came
down
to
say
that
her
husband
specially
wished
to
see
me
so
we
both
went
to
his
room
but
he
had
dozed
off
into
a
queer
restless
sleep
before
we
arrived
the
wife
said
he
must
not
be
awakened
on
any
account
but
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
him
and
he
certainly
looked
bad
and
was
moaning
as
if
in
a
good
deal
of
pain
she
gave
me
the
keys
of
a
bureau
in
his
room
and
i
took
out
some
estimates
and
left
a
note
for
him
telling
him
to
come
on
as
soon
as
he
was
well
enough
and
your
visit
to
his
room
never
roused
him
i
said
no
although
murdock
and
i
made
a
pretty
good
bit
of
noise
moving
about
and
opening
and
shutting
drawers
his
moans
were
quite
heartrending
he
was
evidently
in
considerable
pain
and
i
was
glad
to
get
away
as
that
sort
of
thing
always
upsets
me
who
is
this
murdock
i
asked
oh
the
man
who
has
looked
after
the
place
for
years
i
was
referred
to
him
by
my
solicitors
he
seems
a
most
capable
person
and
i
hope
to
goodness
he
wo
be
ill
long
if
he
is
i
shall
find
myself
in
rather
a
fix
i
made
no
reply
to
this
and
soon
afterwards
cressley
shook
hands
with
me
and
departed
on
his
way
i
went
to
my
room
packed
my
belongings
and
took
the
next
train
to
town
the
business
which
i
had
to
get
through
occupied
the
whole
of
that
evening
and
also
some
hours
of
the
following
day
i
found
i
was
not
able
to
start
for
liverpool
before
the
train
at
euston
and
should
not
therefore
arrive
at
lime
street
before
five
too
late
to
catch
the
train
for
brent
the
nearest
station
to
cressley
place
another
train
left
central
station
for
brent
however
at
seven
and
i
determined
to
wire
to
cressley
to
tell
him
to
meet
me
by
the
latter
train
this
was
the
last
train
in
the
day
but
there
was
no
fear
of
my
missing
it
i
arrived
at
lime
street
almost
to
the
moment
and
drove
straight
to
the
prince
hotel
where
i
had
left
my
bag
the
day
before
here
a
telegram
awaited
me
it
was
from
cressley
and
ran
as
follows
hope
this
will
reach
you
time
if
so
call
at
murdock
house
no
melville
gardens
if
possible
see
him
and
get
the
documents
referred
to
in
schedule
a
he
will
know
what
you
mean
most
important
cressley
i
glanced
at
the
clock
in
the
hall
it
was
now
a
quarter
past
five
my
train
would
leave
at
seven
i
had
plenty
of
time
to
get
something
to
eat
and
then
go
to
murdock
having
despatched
my
telegram
to
cressley
telling
him
to
look
out
for
me
by
the
train
which
arrived
at
brent
at
nine
i
ordered
a
meal
ate
it
and
then
hailing
a
cab
gave
the
driver
the
number
of
murdock
house
melville
gardens
was
situated
somewhat
in
the
suburbs
and
it
was
twenty
minutes
drive
from
my
hotel
when
we
drew
up
at
murdock
door
i
told
the
cabman
to
wait
and
getting
out
rang
the
bell
the
servant
who
answered
my
summons
told
me
that
the
agent
was
still
very
ill
and
could
not
be
seen
by
any
one
i
then
inquired
for
the
wife
i
was
informed
that
she
was
out
but
would
be
back
soon
i
looked
at
my
watch
it
was
just
six
i
determined
to
wait
to
see
murdock
if
possible
having
paid
and
dismissed
my
cab
i
was
shown
into
a
small
untidily
kept
parlour
where
i
was
left
to
my
own
meditations
the
weather
was
hot
and
the
room
close
i
paced
up
and
down
restlessly
the
minutes
flew
by
and
murdock
did
not
put
in
an
appearance
i
looked
at
my
watch
which
now
pointed
to
twenty
minutes
past
six
it
would
take
me
in
an
ordinary
cab
nearly
twenty
minutes
to
reach
the
station
in
order
to
make
all
safe
i
ought
to
leave
murdock
house
in
ten
minutes
from
now
at
the
latest
i
went
and
stood
by
the
window
watching
anxiously
for
murdock
to
put
in
an
appearance
melville
gardens
was
a
somewhat
lonely
place
and
few
people
passed
the
house
which
was
old
and
shabby
it
had
evidently
not
been
done
up
for
years
i
was
just
turning
round
in
order
to
ring
the
bell
to
leave
a
message
with
the
servant
when
the
room
door
was
opened
and
to
my
astonishment
in
walked
wickham
the
man
i
had
last
seen
on
board
the
he
came
up
to
me
at
once
and
held
out
his
hand
no
doubt
you
are
surprised
at
seeing
me
here
bell
he
exclaimed
i
certainly
was
for
a
moment
i
answered
but
then
i
added
the
world
is
a
small
place
and
one
soon
gets
accustomed
to
acquaintances
cropping
up
in
all
sorts
of
unlikely
quarters
why
unlikely
said
wickham
why
should
i
not
know
murdock
who
happens
to
be
a
very
special
and
very
old
friend
of
mine
i
might
as
well
ask
you
why
you
are
interested
in
him
because
i
happen
to
be
a
friend
of
arthur
cressley
i
answered
and
have
come
here
on
his
business
and
so
am
i
also
a
friend
of
cressley
he
has
asked
me
to
go
and
see
him
at
cressley
hall
some
day
and
i
hope
to
avail
myself
of
his
invitation
the
servant
told
me
that
you
were
waiting
for
murdock
can
i
give
her
any
message
from
you
i
want
to
see
murdock
himself
i
said
after
a
pause
do
you
think
that
it
is
possible
for
me
to
have
an
interview
with
him
i
left
him
just
now
and
he
was
asleep
said
wickham
he
is
still
very
ill
and
i
think
the
doctor
is
a
little
anxious
about
him
it
would
not
do
to
disturb
him
on
any
account
of
course
if
he
happens
to
awake
he
might
be
able
to
tell
you
what
you
want
to
know
by
the
way
has
it
anything
to
do
with
cressley
hall
yes
i
have
just
had
a
telegram
from
cressley
and
the
message
is
somewhat
important
you
are
quite
sure
that
murdock
is
asleep
he
was
when
i
left
the
room
but
i
will
go
up
again
and
see
are
you
going
to
london
mr
bell
no
i
am
going
down
to
cressley
hall
and
must
catch
the
seven
train
i
have
not
a
moment
to
wait
as
i
spoke
i
took
out
my
watch
it
only
wants
minutes
to
seven
i
said
and
i
never
care
to
run
a
train
to
the
last
moment
there
is
no
help
for
it
i
suppose
i
must
go
without
seeing
murdock
cressley
will
in
all
probability
send
down
a
message
for
the
papers
he
requires
just
stay
a
moment
said
wickham
putting
on
an
anxious
expression
it
is
a
great
pity
that
you
should
not
see
cressley
agent
if
it
is
as
vital
as
all
that
ah
and
here
comes
murdock
wait
one
moment
i
go
and
speak
to
her
he
went
out
of
the
room
and
i
heard
him
say
something
in
a
low
voice
in
the
passage
a
woman
voice
replied
and
the
next
instant
murdock
stood
before
me
she
was
a
tall
woman
with
a
sallow
face
and
sandy
hair
she
had
a
blank
sort
of
stare
about
her
and
scarcely
any
expression
now
she
fixed
her
dull
eyes
on
my
face
and
held
out
her
hand
you
are
mr
bell
she
said
i
have
heard
of
you
of
course
from
cressley
so
you
are
going
to
spend
with
him
at
cressley
hall
i
am
glad
for
it
is
a
lonely
place
the
most
lonely
place
i
know
pardon
me
i
interrupted
i
can
not
stay
to
talk
to
you
now
or
i
shall
miss
my
train
can
i
see
your
husband
or
can
i
not
she
glanced
at
wickham
then
she
said
with
hesitation
if
he
is
asleep
it
would
not
do
to
disturb
him
but
there
is
a
chance
of
his
being
awake
now
i
do
quite
understand
about
the
papers
i
wish
i
did
it
would
be
best
for
you
to
see
him
certainly
follow
me
upstairs
and
i
tell
you
what
called
wickham
after
us
i
go
and
engage
a
cab
so
that
you
shall
lose
as
short
a
time
as
possible
mr
bell
i
thanked
him
and
followed
the
wife
upstairs
the
stairs
were
narrow
and
steep
and
we
soon
reached
the
small
landing
at
the
top
four
bedrooms
opened
into
it
murdock
turned
the
handle
of
the
one
which
exactly
faced
the
stairs
and
we
both
entered
here
the
blinds
were
down
and
the
chamber
was
considerably
darkened
the
room
was
a
small
one
and
the
greater
part
of
the
space
was
occupied
by
an
albert
bedstead
with
the
curtains
pulled
forward
within
i
could
just
see
the
shadowy
outline
of
a
figure
and
i
distinctly
heard
the
feeble
groans
of
the
sick
man
ah
what
a
pity
my
husband
is
still
asleep
said
murdock
as
she
turned
softly
round
to
me
and
put
her
finger
to
her
lips
it
would
injure
him
very
much
to
awaken
him
she
said
you
can
go
and
look
at
him
if
you
like
you
will
see
how
very
ill
he
is
i
wonder
if
i
could
help
you
with
regard
to
the
papers
you
want
mr
bell
i
want
the
documents
referred
to
in
schedule
a
i
answered
schedule
a
she
repeated
speaking
under
her
breath
i
remember
that
name
surely
all
the
papers
relating
to
it
are
in
this
drawer
i
think
i
can
get
them
for
you
she
crossed
the
room
as
she
spoke
and
standing
with
her
back
to
the
bedstead
took
a
bunch
of
keys
from
a
table
which
stood
near
and
fitted
one
into
the
lock
of
a
high
bureau
made
of
mahogany
she
pulled
open
a
drawer
and
began
to
examine
its
contents
while
she
was
so
occupied
i
approached
the
bed
and
bending
slightly
forward
took
a
good
stare
at
the
sick
man
i
had
never
seen
murdock
before
there
was
little
doubt
that
he
was
ill
he
looked
very
ill
indeed
his
face
was
long
and
cadaverous
the
cheek
bones
were
high
and
the
cheeks
below
were
much
sunken
in
the
lips
which
were
were
slightly
drawn
apart
and
some
broken
irregular
teeth
were
visible
the
eyebrows
were
scanty
and
the
hair
was
much
worn
away
from
the
high
and
hollow
forehead
the
man
looked
sick
unto
death
i
had
seldom
seen
any
one
with
an
expression
like
his
the
closed
eyes
were
much
sunken
and
the
moaning
which
came
from
the
livid
lips
was
horrible
to
listen
to
after
giving
murdock
a
long
and
earnest
stare
i
stepped
back
from
the
bed
and
was
just
about
to
speak
to
murdock
who
was
rustling
papers
in
the
drawer
when
the
most
strong
and
irresistible
curiosity
assailed
me
i
could
not
account
for
it
but
i
felt
bound
to
yield
to
its
suggestions
i
turned
again
and
bent
close
over
the
sick
man
surely
there
was
something
monotonous
about
that
breath
those
moans
too
came
at
wonderfully
regular
intervals
scarcely
knowing
why
i
did
it
i
stretched
out
my
hand
and
laid
it
on
the
forehead
good
god
what
was
the
matter
i
felt
myself
turning
cold
the
perspiration
stood
out
on
my
own
brow
i
had
not
touched
a
living
forehead
at
all
flesh
was
flesh
it
was
impossible
to
mistake
the
feel
but
there
was
no
flesh
here
the
figure
in
the
bed
was
neither
a
living
nor
a
dead
man
it
was
a
wax
representation
of
one
but
why
did
it
moan
and
how
was
it
possible
for
it
not
to
breathe
making
the
greatest
effort
of
my
life
i
repressed
an
exclamation
and
when
murdock
approached
me
with
the
necessary
papers
in
her
hand
took
them
from
her
in
my
usual
manner
these
all
relate
to
schedule
a
she
said
i
hope
i
am
not
doing
wrong
in
giving
them
to
you
without
my
husband
leave
he
looks
very
ill
does
he
not
he
looks
as
bad
as
he
can
look
i
answered
i
moved
towards
the
door
something
in
my
tone
must
have
alarmed
her
for
a
curious
expression
of
fear
dilated
the
pupils
of
her
light
blue
eyes
she
followed
me
downstairs
a
hansom
was
waiting
for
me
i
nodded
to
wickham
did
not
even
wait
to
shake
hands
with
murdock
and
sprang
into
the
cab
central
station
i
shouted
to
the
man
and
then
as
he
whipped
up
his
horse
and
flew
down
the
street
a
sovereign
if
you
get
there
before
seven
we
were
soon
dashing
quickly
along
the
streets
i
did
not
know
liverpool
well
and
consequently
could
not
exactly
tell
where
the
man
was
going
when
i
got
into
the
hansom
it
wanted
twelve
minutes
to
seven
these
minutes
were
quickly
flying
and
still
no
station
are
you
sure
you
are
going
right
i
shouted
through
the
hole
in
the
roof
you
be
there
in
a
minute
sir
he
answered
it
lime
street
station
you
want
is
it
no
central
station
i
answered
i
told
you
central
station
drive
there
at
once
like
the
very
devil
i
must
catch
that
train
for
it
is
the
last
one
all
right
sir
i
can
do
it
he
cried
whipping
up
his
horse
again
once
more
i
pulled
out
my
watch
the
hands
pointed
to
three
minutes
to
seven
at
ten
minutes
past
we
were
driving
into
the
station
i
flung
the
man
half
a
sovereign
and
darted
into
the
to
brent
sir
the
last
train
has
just
gone
said
the
clerk
with
an
impassive
stare
at
me
through
the
little
window
i
flung
my
bag
down
in
disgust
and
swore
a
great
oath
but
for
that
idiot
of
a
driver
i
should
have
just
caught
the
train
all
of
a
sudden
a
horrible
thought
flashed
through
my
brain
had
the
cabman
been
bribed
by
wickham
no
directions
could
have
been
plainer
than
mine
i
had
told
the
man
to
drive
to
central
station
central
station
did
not
sound
the
least
like
lime
street
station
how
was
it
possible
for
him
to
make
so
grave
a
mistake
the
more
i
considered
the
matter
the
more
certain
i
was
that
a
black
plot
was
brewing
and
that
wickham
was
in
the
thick
of
it
my
brain
began
to
whirl
with
excitement
what
was
the
matter
why
was
a
lay
figure
in
murdock
bed
why
had
i
been
taken
upstairs
to
see
it
without
any
doubt
both
murdock
and
wickham
wished
me
to
see
what
was
such
an
admirable
imitation
of
a
sick
man
an
imitation
so
good
with
those
ghastly
moans
coming
from
the
lips
that
it
would
have
taken
in
the
sharpest
detective
in
scotland
yard
i
myself
was
deceived
until
i
touched
the
forehead
this
state
of
things
had
not
been
brought
to
pass
without
a
reason
what
was
the
reason
could
it
be
possible
that
murdock
was
wanted
elsewhere
and
it
was
thought
well
that
i
should
see
him
in
order
to
prove
an
alibi
should
he
be
suspected
of
a
ghastly
crime
my
god
what
could
this
mean
from
the
first
i
had
mistrusted
wickham
what
was
he
doing
in
murdock
house
for
what
purpose
had
he
bribed
the
driver
of
the
cab
in
order
to
make
me
lose
my
train
the
more
i
thought
the
more
certain
i
was
that
cressley
was
in
grave
danger
and
i
now
determined
cost
what
it
might
to
get
to
him
that
night
i
left
the
station
took
a
cab
and
drove
back
to
my
hotel
i
asked
to
see
the
manager
a
tall
dark
man
in
a
emerged
from
a
door
at
the
back
of
the
office
and
inquired
what
he
could
do
for
me
i
begged
permission
to
speak
to
him
alone
and
we
passed
into
his
private
room
i
am
in
an
extraordinary
position
i
began
circumstances
of
a
private
nature
make
it
absolutely
necessary
that
i
should
go
to
a
place
called
cressley
hall
about
fourteen
miles
from
brent
brent
is
sixty
miles
down
the
line
and
the
last
train
has
gone
i
could
take
a
but
there
might
be
an
interminable
delay
at
brent
and
i
prefer
to
drive
straight
to
cressley
hall
across
country
can
you
assist
me
by
directing
me
to
some
good
jobmaster
from
whom
i
can
hire
a
carriage
and
horses
the
man
looked
at
me
with
raised
eyebrows
he
evidently
thought
i
was
mad
i
mean
what
i
say
i
added
and
am
prepared
to
back
my
words
with
a
substantial
sum
can
you
help
me
i
dare
say
you
might
get
a
carriage
and
horses
to
do
it
he
replied
but
it
is
a
very
long
way
and
over
a
hilly
country
no
two
horses
could
go
such
a
distance
without
rest
you
would
have
to
change
from
time
to
time
as
you
went
i
will
send
across
to
the
hotel
stables
for
my
man
and
you
can
see
him
about
it
he
rang
the
bell
and
gave
his
orders
in
a
few
moments
the
jobmaster
came
in
i
hurriedly
explained
to
him
what
i
wanted
at
first
he
said
it
was
impossible
that
his
best
horses
were
out
and
that
those
he
had
in
his
stables
could
not
possibly
attempt
such
a
journey
but
when
i
brought
out
my
and
offered
to
advance
any
sum
in
reason
he
hesitated
of
course
there
is
one
way
in
which
it
might
be
managed
sir
i
would
take
you
myself
as
far
as
ovenden
which
is
miles
from
here
there
i
know
we
could
get
a
pair
of
fresh
horses
from
the
swan
and
if
we
wired
at
once
from
here
horses
might
be
ready
at
carlton
which
is
another
twenty
miles
on
the
road
but
at
our
best
sir
it
will
be
between
two
and
three
in
the
morning
before
we
get
to
brent
i
am
sorry
to
hear
you
say
so
i
answered
but
it
is
better
to
arrive
then
than
to
wait
until
please
send
the
necessary
telegram
off
without
a
moment
delay
and
get
the
carriage
ready
put
the
horses
in
at
once
john
said
the
manager
you
had
better
take
the
light
wagonette
you
ought
to
get
there
between
one
and
two
in
the
morning
with
that
then
he
added
as
the
man
left
the
room
i
suppose
sir
your
business
is
very
urgent
it
is
i
replied
shortly
he
looked
as
if
he
would
like
to
question
me
further
but
refrained
a
few
moments
later
i
had
taken
my
seat
beside
the
driver
and
we
were
speeding
at
a
good
round
pace
through
the
streets
of
liverpool
we
passed
quickly
through
the
suburbs
and
out
into
the
open
country
the
evening
was
a
lovely
one
and
the
country
looked
its
best
it
was
difficult
to
believe
as
i
drove
through
the
peaceful
landscape
that
in
all
probability
a
dark
deed
was
in
contemplation
and
that
the
young
man
to
whom
i
had
taken
a
most
sincere
liking
was
in
danger
of
his
life
as
i
drove
silently
by
my
companion
side
i
reviewed
the
whole
situation
the
more
i
thought
of
it
the
less
i
liked
it
on
board
the
wickham
had
been
abnormally
interested
in
cressley
cressley
had
himself
confided
to
him
his
superstitious
dread
with
regard
to
the
turret
room
cressley
had
come
home
with
a
fortune
and
if
he
floated
his
syndicate
he
would
be
a
millionaire
wickham
scarcely
looked
like
a
rich
man
then
why
should
he
know
murdock
and
why
should
a
lay
figure
be
put
in
murdock
bed
why
also
through
a
most
unnatural
accident
should
i
have
lost
my
train
the
more
i
thought
the
graver
and
graver
became
my
fears
gradually
darkness
settled
over
the
land
and
then
a
rising
moon
flooded
the
country
in
its
weird
light
i
had
been
on
many
a
wild
expedition
before
but
in
some
ways
never
a
wilder
than
this
its
very
uncertainty
wrapped
as
it
was
in
unformed
suspicions
gave
it
an
air
of
inexpressible
mystery
on
and
on
we
went
reaching
ovenden
between
nine
and
ten
at
night
here
horses
were
ready
for
us
and
we
again
started
on
our
way
when
we
got
to
carlton
however
there
came
a
hitch
in
my
arrangements
we
drew
up
at
the
little
inn
to
find
the
place
in
total
darkness
and
all
the
inhabitants
evidently
in
bed
and
asleep
with
some
difficulty
we
roused
the
landlord
and
asked
why
the
horses
which
had
been
telegraphed
for
had
not
been
got
ready
we
did
not
get
them
when
the
second
telegram
arrived
was
the
reply
the
second
telegram
i
cried
my
heart
beating
fast
what
do
you
mean
there
were
two
sir
both
coming
from
the
same
stables
the
first
was
written
desiring
us
to
have
the
horses
ready
at
any
cost
the
second
contradicted
the
first
and
said
that
the
gentleman
had
changed
his
mind
and
was
not
going
on
receipt
of
that
sir
i
shut
up
the
house
as
usual
and
we
all
went
to
bed
i
am
very
sorry
if
there
has
been
any
mistake
there
has
and
a
terrible
one
i
could
not
help
muttering
under
my
breath
my
fears
were
getting
graver
than
ever
who
had
sent
the
second
telegram
was
it
possible
that
i
had
been
followed
by
wickham
who
took
these
means
of
circumventing
me
we
must
get
horses
and
at
once
i
said
never
mind
about
the
second
telegram
it
was
a
mistake
peach
the
jobmaster
muttered
an
oath
i
ca
understand
what
is
up
he
said
he
looked
mystified
and
not
too
well
pleased
then
he
added
these
horses
ca
go
another
step
sir
they
must
if
we
can
get
no
others
i
said
i
went
up
to
him
and
began
to
whisper
in
his
ear
this
is
a
matter
of
life
and
death
my
good
friend
only
the
direst
necessity
takes
me
on
this
journey
the
second
telegram
without
doubt
was
sent
by
a
man
whom
i
am
trying
to
circumvent
i
know
what
i
am
saying
we
must
get
horses
or
these
must
go
on
we
have
not
an
instant
to
lose
there
is
a
conspiracy
afoot
to
do
serious
injury
to
the
owner
of
cressley
hall
what
the
young
gentleman
who
has
just
come
from
australia
you
mean
to
say
he
is
in
danger
said
peach
he
is
in
the
gravest
danger
i
do
mind
who
knows
i
have
reason
for
my
fears
while
i
was
speaking
the
landlord
drew
near
he
overheard
some
of
my
last
words
the
landlord
and
peach
now
exchanged
glances
after
a
moment
the
landlord
spoke
a
neighbour
of
ours
sir
has
got
two
good
horses
he
said
he
is
the
doctor
in
this
village
i
believe
he
lend
them
if
the
case
is
as
urgent
as
you
say
go
and
ask
him
i
cried
you
shall
have
ten
pounds
if
we
are
on
the
road
in
five
minutes
from
the
present
moment
at
this
hint
the
landlord
flew
he
came
back
in
an
incredibly
short
space
of
time
accompanied
by
the
doctor
coachman
leading
the
horses
they
were
quickly
harnessed
to
the
wagonette
and
once
more
we
started
on
our
way
now
drive
as
you
never
drove
before
in
the
whole
course
of
your
life
i
said
to
peach
money
is
no
object
we
have
still
fifteen
miles
to
go
and
over
a
rough
country
you
can
claim
any
reward
in
reason
if
you
get
to
cressley
hall
within
an
hour
it
can
not
be
done
sir
he
replied
but
then
he
glanced
at
me
and
some
of
the
determination
in
my
face
was
reflected
in
his
he
whipped
up
the
horses
they
were
thoroughbred
animals
and
worked
well
under
pressure
we
reached
the
gates
of
cressley
hall
between
two
and
three
in
the
morning
here
i
thought
it
best
to
draw
up
and
told
my
coachman
that
i
should
not
need
his
services
any
longer
if
you
are
afraid
of
mischief
sir
would
it
not
be
best
for
me
to
lie
about
here
he
asked
i
rather
be
in
the
neighbourhood
in
case
you
want
me
i
am
interested
in
this
here
job
sir
you
may
well
be
my
man
god
grant
it
is
not
a
black
business
well
walk
the
horses
up
and
down
if
you
like
if
you
see
nothing
of
me
within
the
next
couple
of
hours
judge
that
matters
are
all
right
and
return
with
the
horses
to
carlton
this
being
arranged
i
turned
from
peach
and
entered
the
lodge
gates
just
inside
was
a
low
cottage
surrounded
by
trees
i
paused
for
a
moment
to
consider
what
i
had
better
do
my
difficulty
now
was
how
to
obtain
admittance
to
the
hall
for
of
course
it
would
be
shut
up
and
all
its
inhabitants
asleep
at
this
hour
suddenly
an
idea
struck
me
i
determined
to
knock
up
the
and
to
enlist
her
assistance
i
went
across
to
the
door
and
presently
succeeded
in
rousing
the
inmates
a
woman
of
about
fifty
appeared
i
explained
to
her
my
position
and
begged
of
her
to
give
me
her
help
she
hesitated
at
first
in
unutterable
astonishment
but
then
seeing
something
in
my
face
which
convinced
her
i
suppose
of
the
truth
of
my
story
for
it
was
necessary
to
alarm
her
in
order
to
induce
her
to
do
anything
she
said
she
would
do
what
i
wished
i
know
the
room
where
mitchell
the
old
housekeeper
sleeps
she
said
and
we
can
easily
wake
him
by
throwing
stones
up
at
his
window
if
you
just
wait
a
minute
i
put
a
shawl
over
my
head
and
go
with
you
she
ran
into
an
inner
room
and
quickly
together
we
made
our
way
along
the
drive
which
far
as
i
could
see
ran
through
a
park
studded
with
old
timber
we
went
round
the
house
to
the
back
entrance
and
the
woman
after
a
delay
of
two
or
three
moments
during
which
i
was
on
thorns
managed
to
wake
up
mitchell
the
housekeeper
he
came
to
his
window
threw
it
open
and
poked
out
his
head
what
can
be
wrong
he
said
it
is
bell
james
was
the
reply
the
gentleman
who
has
been
expected
at
the
hall
all
the
evening
he
has
come
now
and
wants
you
to
admit
him
the
old
man
said
that
he
would
come
downstairs
he
did
so
and
opening
a
door
stood
in
front
of
it
barring
my
entrance
are
you
really
the
gentleman
cressley
has
been
expecting
he
said
i
am
i
replied
i
missed
my
train
and
was
obliged
to
drive
out
there
is
urgent
need
why
i
should
see
your
master
immediately
where
is
he
i
hope
in
bed
sir
and
asleep
it
is
nearly
three
in
the
morning
never
mind
the
hour
i
said
i
must
see
cressley
immediately
can
you
take
me
to
his
room
if
i
am
sure
that
you
are
john
bell
said
the
old
man
glancing
at
me
with
not
unnatural
suspicion
rest
assured
on
that
point
here
this
is
my
card
and
here
is
a
telegram
which
i
received
from
your
master
but
master
sent
no
telegram
you
must
be
mistaken
this
is
from
him
i
do
understand
it
sir
but
you
look
honest
and
i
suppose
i
must
trust
you
you
will
do
well
to
do
so
i
said
he
moved
back
and
i
entered
the
house
he
took
me
down
a
passage
and
then
into
a
lofty
chamber
which
probably
was
the
old
as
well
as
i
could
see
by
the
light
of
the
candle
it
was
floored
and
panelled
with
black
oak
round
the
walls
stood
figures
of
knights
in
armour
with
flags
and
banners
hanging
from
the
panels
above
i
followed
the
old
man
up
a
broad
staircase
and
along
endless
corridors
to
a
more
distant
part
of
the
building
we
turned
now
abruptly
to
our
right
and
soon
began
to
ascend
some
turret
stairs
in
which
room
is
your
master
i
asked
this
is
his
room
sir
said
the
man
he
stood
still
and
pointed
to
a
door
stay
where
you
are
i
may
want
you
i
said
i
seized
his
candle
and
holding
it
above
my
head
opened
the
door
the
room
was
a
large
one
and
when
i
entered
was
in
total
darkness
i
fancied
i
heard
a
rustling
in
the
distance
but
could
see
no
one
then
as
my
eyes
got
accustomed
to
the
faint
light
caused
by
the
candle
i
observed
at
the
further
end
of
the
chamber
a
large
bedstead
i
immediately
noticed
something
very
curious
about
it
i
turned
round
to
the
old
housekeeper
did
you
really
say
that
cressley
was
sleeping
in
this
room
i
asked
yes
sir
he
must
be
in
bed
some
hours
ago
i
left
him
in
the
library
hunting
up
old
papers
and
he
told
me
he
was
tired
and
was
going
to
rest
early
he
is
not
in
the
bed
i
said
not
in
the
bed
sir
good
god
a
note
of
horror
came
into
the
voice
what
in
the
name
of
fortune
is
the
matter
with
the
bed
as
the
man
spoke
i
rushed
forward
was
it
really
a
bed
at
all
if
it
was
i
had
never
seen
a
stranger
one
upon
it
covering
it
from
head
to
foot
was
a
thick
mattress
from
the
sides
of
which
tassels
were
hanging
there
was
no
human
being
lying
on
the
mattress
nor
was
it
made
up
with
sheets
and
blankets
like
an
ordinary
bed
i
glanced
above
me
the
posts
at
the
four
corners
of
the
bedstead
stood
like
masts
i
saw
at
once
what
had
happened
the
canopy
had
descended
upon
the
bed
was
cressley
beneath
with
a
shout
i
desired
the
old
man
to
come
forward
and
between
us
we
seized
the
mattress
and
exerting
all
our
force
tried
to
drag
it
from
the
bed
in
a
moment
i
saw
it
was
fixed
by
cords
that
held
it
tightly
in
its
place
whipping
out
my
knife
i
severed
these
and
then
hurled
the
heavy
weight
from
the
bed
beneath
lay
cressley
still
as
death
i
put
my
hand
on
his
heart
and
uttered
a
thankful
exclamation
it
was
still
beating
i
was
in
time
i
had
saved
him
after
all
nothing
else
mattered
during
that
supreme
moment
of
thankfulness
a
few
seconds
longer
beneath
that
smothering
mass
and
he
would
have
been
dead
by
what
a
strange
sequence
of
events
had
i
come
to
his
side
just
in
the
nick
of
time
we
must
take
him
from
this
room
before
he
recovers
consciousness
i
said
to
the
old
man
who
was
surprised
and
but
sir
in
the
name
of
heaven
what
has
happened
let
us
examine
the
bed
and
i
will
tell
you
i
said
i
held
up
the
candle
as
i
spoke
a
glance
at
the
posts
was
to
show
me
how
the
deed
had
been
done
the
canopy
above
on
which
the
heavy
mattress
had
been
placed
was
held
in
position
by
strong
cords
which
ran
through
pulleys
at
the
top
of
the
posts
these
were
thick
and
heavy
enough
to
withstand
the
strain
when
the
cords
were
released
the
canopy
with
its
heavy
weight
must
quickly
descend
upon
the
unfortunate
sleeper
who
would
be
smothered
beneath
it
in
a
few
seconds
who
had
planned
and
executed
this
murderous
device
there
was
not
a
soul
to
be
seen
we
will
take
cressley
into
another
room
and
then
come
back
i
said
to
the
housekeeper
is
there
one
where
we
can
place
him
yes
sir
was
the
instant
reply
there
a
room
on
the
next
floor
which
was
got
ready
for
you
capital
i
answered
we
will
convey
him
there
at
once
we
did
so
and
after
using
some
restoratives
he
came
to
himself
when
he
saw
me
he
gazed
at
me
with
an
expression
of
horror
on
his
face
am
i
alive
or
is
it
a
dream
he
said
you
are
alive
but
you
have
had
a
narrow
escape
of
your
life
i
answered
i
then
told
him
how
i
had
found
him
he
sat
up
as
i
began
to
speak
and
as
i
continued
my
narrative
his
eyes
dilated
with
an
expression
of
terror
which
i
have
seldom
seen
equalled
you
do
not
know
what
i
have
lived
through
he
said
at
last
i
only
wonder
i
retain
my
reason
oh
that
awful
room
no
wonder
men
died
and
went
mad
there
well
speak
cressley
i
am
all
attention
i
said
you
will
be
the
better
when
you
have
unburdened
yourself
i
can
tell
you
what
happened
in
a
few
words
he
answered
you
know
i
mentioned
the
horrid
sort
of
presentiment
i
had
about
coming
here
at
all
that
first
night
i
could
not
make
up
my
mind
to
sleep
in
the
house
so
i
went
to
the
little
inn
at
brent
i
received
your
telegram
yesterday
and
went
to
meet
you
by
the
last
train
when
you
did
not
come
i
had
a
tussle
with
myself
but
i
could
think
of
no
decent
excuse
for
deserting
the
old
place
and
so
came
back
my
intention
was
to
sit
up
the
greater
part
of
the
night
arranging
papers
in
the
library
the
days
are
long
now
and
i
thought
i
might
go
to
bed
when
morning
broke
i
was
irresistibly
sleepy
however
and
went
up
to
my
room
soon
after
one
i
was
determined
to
think
of
nothing
unpleasant
and
got
quickly
into
bed
taking
the
precaution
first
to
lock
the
door
i
placed
the
key
under
my
pillow
and
being
very
tired
soon
fell
into
a
heavy
sleep
i
awoke
suddenly
after
what
seemed
but
a
few
minutes
to
find
the
room
dark
for
the
moon
must
just
have
set
i
was
very
sleepy
and
i
wondered
vaguely
why
i
had
awakened
and
then
suddenly
without
warning
and
without
cause
a
monstrous
unreasonable
fear
seized
me
an
indefinable
intuition
told
me
that
i
was
not
alone
that
some
horrible
presence
was
near
i
do
not
think
the
certainty
of
immediate
death
could
have
inspired
me
with
a
greater
dread
than
that
which
suddenly
came
upon
me
i
dared
not
stir
hand
nor
foot
my
powers
of
reason
and
resistance
were
paralysed
at
last
by
an
immense
effort
i
nerved
myself
to
see
the
worst
slowly
very
slowly
i
turned
my
head
and
opened
my
eyes
against
the
tapestry
at
the
further
corner
of
the
room
in
the
dark
shadow
stood
a
figure
it
stood
out
quite
boldly
emanating
from
itself
a
curious
light
i
had
no
time
to
think
of
phosphorus
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
any
trick
was
being
played
upon
me
i
felt
certain
that
i
was
looking
at
my
ancestor
barrington
cressley
who
had
come
back
to
torture
me
in
order
to
make
me
give
up
possession
the
figure
was
that
of
a
man
six
feet
high
and
broad
in
proportion
the
face
was
bent
forward
and
turned
toward
me
but
in
the
uncertain
light
i
could
neither
see
the
features
nor
the
expression
the
figure
stood
as
still
as
a
statue
and
was
evidently
watching
me
at
the
end
of
a
moment
which
seemed
to
me
an
eternity
it
began
to
move
and
with
a
slow
and
silent
step
approached
me
i
lay
perfectly
still
every
muscle
braced
and
watched
the
figure
between
eyelids
it
was
now
within
a
foot
or
two
of
me
and
i
could
distinctly
see
the
face
what
was
my
horror
to
observe
that
it
wore
the
features
of
my
agent
murdock
i
cried
the
word
coming
in
a
strangled
sound
from
my
throat
the
next
instant
he
had
sprung
upon
me
i
heard
a
noise
of
something
rattling
above
and
saw
a
huge
shadow
descending
upon
me
i
did
not
know
what
it
was
and
i
felt
certain
that
i
was
being
murdered
the
next
moment
all
was
lost
in
unconsciousness
bell
how
queer
you
look
was
it
was
it
murdock
but
it
could
not
have
been
he
was
very
ill
in
bed
at
liverpool
what
in
the
name
of
goodness
was
the
awful
horror
through
which
i
had
lived
i
can
assure
you
on
one
point
i
answered
it
was
no
ghost
and
as
to
murdock
it
is
more
than
likely
that
you
did
see
him
i
then
told
the
poor
fellow
what
i
had
discovered
with
regard
to
the
agent
and
also
my
firm
conviction
that
wickham
was
at
the
bottom
of
it
cressley
astonishment
was
beyond
bounds
and
i
saw
at
first
that
he
scarcely
believed
me
but
when
i
said
that
it
was
my
intention
to
search
the
house
he
accompanied
me
we
both
followed
by
mitchell
returned
to
the
room
but
though
we
examined
the
tapestry
and
panelling
we
could
not
find
the
secret
means
by
which
the
villain
had
obtained
access
to
the
chamber
the
carriage
which
brought
me
here
is
still
waiting
just
outside
the
lodge
gates
i
said
what
do
you
say
to
leaving
this
place
at
once
and
returning
at
least
as
far
as
carlton
we
might
spend
the
remainder
of
the
night
there
and
take
the
very
first
train
to
liverpool
anything
to
get
away
said
cressley
i
do
not
feel
that
i
can
ever
come
back
to
cressley
hall
again
you
feel
that
now
but
your
sensations
will
be
different
i
answered
as
i
spoke
i
called
mitchell
to
me
i
desired
him
to
go
at
once
to
the
lodge
gates
and
ask
the
driver
of
the
wagonette
to
come
down
to
the
hall
this
was
done
and
half
an
hour
afterwards
cressley
and
i
were
on
our
way
back
to
carlton
early
the
next
morning
we
went
to
liverpool
there
we
visited
the
police
and
i
asked
to
have
a
warrant
taken
out
for
the
apprehension
of
murdock
the
superintendent
on
hearing
my
tale
suggested
that
we
should
go
at
once
to
murdock
house
in
melville
gardens
we
did
so
but
it
was
empty
murdock
his
wife
and
wickham
having
thought
it
best
to
decamp
the
superintendent
insisted
however
on
having
the
house
searched
and
in
a
dark
closet
at
the
top
we
came
upon
a
most
extraordinary
contrivance
this
was
no
less
than
an
exact
representation
of
the
agent
head
and
neck
in
wax
in
it
was
a
wonderfully
skilful
imitation
of
a
human
larynx
which
by
a
cunning
mechanism
of
clockwork
could
be
made
exactly
to
simulate
the
breathing
and
low
moaning
of
a
human
being
this
the
man
had
of
course
utilized
with
the
connivance
of
his
wife
and
wickham
in
order
to
prove
an
alibi
and
the
deception
was
so
complete
that
only
my
own
irresistible
curiosity
could
have
enabled
me
to
discover
the
secret
that
night
the
police
were
fortunate
enough
to
capture
both
murdock
and
wickham
in
a
liverpool
slum
seeing
that
all
was
up
the
villains
made
complete
confession
and
the
whole
of
the
black
plot
was
revealed
it
appeared
that
two
adventurers
the
worst
form
of
scoundrels
knew
of
cressley
great
discovery
in
western
australia
and
had
made
up
their
minds
to
forestall
him
in
his
claim
one
of
these
men
had
come
some
months
ago
to
england
and
while
in
liverpool
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
murdock
the
other
man
wickham
accompanied
cressley
on
the
voyage
in
order
to
keep
him
in
view
and
worm
as
many
secrets
as
possible
from
him
when
cressley
spoke
of
his
superstition
with
regard
to
the
turret
room
it
immediately
occurred
to
wickham
to
utilize
the
room
for
his
destruction
murdock
proved
a
ready
tool
in
the
hands
of
the
rogues
they
offered
him
an
enormous
bribe
and
then
the
three
between
them
evolved
the
intricate
and
subtle
details
of
the
crime
it
was
arranged
that
murdock
was
to
commit
the
ghastly
deed
and
for
this
purpose
he
was
sent
down
quietly
to
brent
disguised
as
a
journeyman
the
day
before
cressley
went
to
the
hall
the
men
had
thought
that
cressley
would
prove
an
easy
prey
but
they
distrusted
me
from
the
first
their
relief
was
great
when
they
discovered
that
i
could
not
accompany
cressley
to
the
hall
and
had
he
spent
the
first
night
there
the
murder
would
have
been
committed
but
his
nervous
terrors
inducing
him
to
spend
the
night
at
brent
foiled
this
attempt
seeing
that
i
was
returning
to
liverpool
the
men
now
thought
that
they
would
use
me
for
their
own
devices
and
made
up
their
minds
to
decoy
me
into
murdock
bedroom
in
order
that
i
might
see
the
wax
figure
their
object
of
course
being
that
i
should
be
forced
to
prove
an
alibi
in
case
murdock
was
suspected
of
the
crime
the
telegram
which
reached
me
at
prince
hotel
on
my
return
from
london
was
sent
by
one
of
the
ruffians
who
was
lying
in
ambush
at
brent
when
i
left
murdock
house
the
wife
informed
wickham
that
she
thought
from
my
manner
i
suspected
something
he
had
already
taken
steps
to
induce
the
to
take
me
in
a
wrong
direction
in
order
that
i
should
miss
my
train
and
it
was
not
until
he
visited
the
stables
outside
the
prince
hotel
that
he
found
that
i
intended
to
go
by
road
he
then
played
his
last
card
when
he
telegraphed
to
the
inn
at
carlton
to
stop
the
horses
by
means
wickham
and
his
confederate
had
the
run
of
the
rooms
at
the
hall
ever
since
the
arrival
of
wickham
from
australia
and
they
had
rigged
up
the
top
of
the
old
bedstead
in
the
way
i
have
described
there
was
needless
to
say
a
secret
passage
at
the
back
of
the
tapestry
which
was
so
cunningly
hidden
in
the
panelling
as
to
baffle
all
ordinary
means
of
discovery
