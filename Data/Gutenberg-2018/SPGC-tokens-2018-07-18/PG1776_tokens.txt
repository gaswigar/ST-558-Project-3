you

flatters
us
as
well
appeareth
by
the
cause
you
come

appeal
each
other
of
high
treason
cousin
of
hereford
what
dost
thou
object
against
the
duke
of
norfolk
thomas
mowbray
bolingbroke
be
the
record
to
my
speech
in
the
devotion
of
a
subject
love
the
precious
safety
of
my
prince
and
free
from
other
misbegotten
hate
come
i
appellant
to
this
princely
presence
now
thomas
mowbray
do
i
turn
to
thee
and
mark
my
greeting
well
for
what
i
speak
my
body
shall
make
good
upon
this
earth
or
my
divine
soul
answer
it
in
thou
art
a
traitor
and
a
miscreant
too
good
to
be
so
and
too
bad
to
live
since
the
more
fair
and
crystal
is
the
sky
the
uglier
seem
the
clouds
that
in
it
fly
once
more
the
more
to
aggravate
the
note
with
a
foul
traitor
name
stuff
i
thy
throat
and
please
my
i
move
what
my
tongue
speaks
my
right
drawn
sword
may
prove
mowbray
let
not
my
cold
words
here
accuse
my
zeal
is
not
the
trial
of
a
woman
war
the
bitter
clamour
of
two
eager
tongues
can
arbitrate
this
cause
betwixt
us
twain
the
blood
is
hot
that
must
be
cool
for
this
yet
can
i
not
of
such
tame
patience
boast
as
to
be
hush
and
nought
at
all
to
say
first
the
fair
reverence
of
your
highness
curbs
me
from
giving
reins
and
spurs
to
my
free
speech
which
else
would
post
until
it
had
these
terms
of
treason
doubled
down
his
throat
setting
aside
his
high
blood
royalty
and
let
him
be
no
kinsman
to
my
liege
i
do
defy
him
and
i
spit
at
him
call
him
a
slanderous
coward
and
a
villain
which
to
maintain
i
would
allow
him
odds
and
meet
him
were
i
tied
to
run
afoot
even
to
the
frozen
ridges
of
the
alps
or
any
other
ground
inhabitable
where
ever
englishman
durst
set
his
foot
meantime
let
this
defend
my
by
all
my
hopes
most
falsely
doth
he
lie
bolingbroke
pale
trembling
coward
there
i
throw
my
gage
disclaiming
here
the
kindred
of
the
king
and
lay
aside
my
high
blood
royalty
which
fear
not
reverence
makes
thee
to
except
if
guilty
dread
have
left
thee
so
much
strength
as
to
take
up
mine
honour
pawn
then
stoop
by
that
and
all
the
rites
of
knighthood
else
will
i
make
good
against
thee
arm
to
arm
what
i
have
spoke
or
thou
canst
worst
devise
mowbray
i
take
it
up
and
by
that
sword
i
swear
which
gently
laid
my
knighthood
on
my
shoulder
i
answer
thee
in
any
fair
degree
or
chivalrous
design
of
knightly
trial
and
when
i
mount
alive
may
i
not
light
if
i
be
traitor
or
unjustly
fight
king
richard
what
doth
our
cousin
lay
to
mowbray
charge
it
must
be
great
that
can
inherit
us
so
much
as
of
a
thought
of
ill
in
him
bolingbroke
look
what
i
speak
my
life
shall
prove
it
that
mowbray
hath
receiv
eight
thousand
nobles
in
name
of
lendings
for
your
highness
soldiers
the
which
he
hath
detain
for
lewd
employments
like
a
false
traitor
and
injurious
villain
besides
i
say
and
will
in
battle
or
here
or
elsewhere
to
the
furthest
verge
that
ever
was
survey
by
english
that
all
the
treasons
for
these
eighteen
years
complotted
and
contrived
in
this
land
fetch
from
false
mowbray
their
first
head
and
spring
further
i
say
and
further
will
maintain
upon
his
bad
life
to
make
all
this
good
that
he
did
plot
the
duke
of
gloucester
death
suggest
his
adversaries
and
consequently
like
a
traitor
coward
sluic
out
his
innocent
soul
through
streams
of
blood
which
blood
like
sacrificing
abel
cries
even
from
the
tongueless
caverns
of
the
earth
to
me
for
justice
and
rough
chastisement
and
by
the
glorious
worth
of
my
descent
this
arm
shall
do
it
or
this
life
be
spent
king
richard
how
high
a
pitch
his
resolution
soars
thomas
of
norfolk
what
thou
to
this
mowbray
o
let
my
sovereign
turn
away
his
face
and
bid
his
ears
a
little
while
be
deaf
till
i
have
told
this
slander
of
his
blood
how
god
and
good
men
hate
so
foul
a
liar
king
richard
mowbray
impartial
are
our
eyes
and
ears
were
he
my
brother
nay
my
kingdom
heir
as
he
is
but
my
father
brother
son
now
by
my
sceptre
awe
i
make
a
vow
such
neighbour
nearness
to
our
sacred
blood
should
nothing
privilege
him
nor
partialize
the
unstooping
firmness
of
my
upright
soul
he
is
our
subject
mowbray
so
art
thou
free
speech
and
fearless
i
to
thee
allow
mowbray
then
bolingbroke
as
low
as
to
thy
heart
through
the
false
passage
of
thy
throat
thou
liest
three
parts
of
that
receipt
i
had
for
calais
disburs
i
duly
to
his
highness
soldiers
the
other
part
reserv
i
by
consent
for
that
my
sovereign
liege
was
in
my
debt
upon
remainder
of
a
dear
account
since
last
i
went
to
france
to
fetch
his
queen
now
swallow
down
that
lie
for
gloucester
i
slew
him
not
but
to
my
own
disgrace
neglected
my
sworn
duty
in
that
case
for
you
my
noble
lord
of
lancaster
the
honourable
father
to
my
foe
once
did
i
lay
an
ambush
for
your
life
a
trespass
that
doth
vex
my
grieved
soul
but
ere
i
last
receiv
the
sacrament
i
did
confess
it
and
exactly
your
grace
pardon
and
i
hope
i
had
it
this
is
my
fault
as
for
the
rest

it
issues
from
the
rancour
of
a
villain
a
recreant

most
degenerate
traitor

in
myself
i
boldly
will
defend
and
interchangeably
hurl

limit
of
thy

now
i
must
forgo
and
now
my

such
is
the

of
kings
gaunt
i
thank
my
liege
that
in

of
me
he
shortens
four
years
of
my
son
exile
but
little
vantage
shall
i
reap
thereby
for
ere
the
six
years
that
he
hath
to

change
their

their
times
about
my

how
far
brought
you

on

i
brought
high

if
you
call

left

parted

for

disdained

since
it

not
he
had
none
of

doubt

reverence
he
did
throw
away
on

wooing
poor

with
the
craft

patient
underbearing
of

to

shortly
mean

that
they
stay
the
first
departing

womb

out

wearisome

your
fair
discourse
hath
been
as
sugar
making
the
hard
way
sweet

delectable

i
bethink
me
what
a
weary
way
from
ravenspurgh
to
cotswold
will
be
found
in
ross
and
willoughby
wanting
your
company
which
i
protest
hath
very
much
the
tediousness

process
of
my
travel
but
theirs
is
with
the
hope
to
have
the
present
benefit
which
i
possess
and
hope
to
joy
is
little
less
in
joy
than
hope
enjoy
by
this
the
weary
lords
shall
make
their
way
seem
short
as
mine
hath
done
by
sight
of
what
i
have
your
noble

less
value

my
company

my
good

hath
forsook
the

broken
his
staff
of
office
and
the
household
of
the
king

what
was
his
reason
he
was
not
so
resolv
when
last
we
spake
together
percy
because
your

was
proclaimed
traitor
but
he
my
lord
is
gone
to
ravenspurgh
to
offer
service
to

duke
of
hereford

sent
me
over
by
berkeley
to
discover
what
power
the

the
hollow
crown
that
rounds
the
mortal
temples
of
a
king

death
his
court
and
there

antic
sits
scoffing
his

grinning
at
his
pomp

a
little
scene
to
monarchize
be
fear
and
kill
with

infusing
him
with

vain
conceit
as
if
this
flesh
which
walls
about
our
life
were
brass
impregnable
and
humour
thus
comes
at
the
last
and
with

your
follies
fight
against

sun
from

perceives
the
envious
clouds
are
bent
to
dim
his

to
stain
the

we
are

and
thus
long
have
we
stood
to
watch
the
fearful
bending
of
thy
knee
because
we
thought
ourself
thy
lawful
king

if
we
be
how
dare
thy
joints
forget
to
pay
their
awful
duty
to
our

if
we
be
not
show
us
the

of
god
that

dismiss
us
from

we
know
no
hand
of
blood
and
bone
can
gripe
the
sacred
handle
of
our
sceptre
unless
he
do
profane
steal
or
usurp
and
though
you
think
that
all
as
you
have
done
have
torn
their
souls
by
turning
them
from
us
and
we
are
barren
and
bereft
of

yet
master
god
omnipotent
is
mustering
in
his
clouds
on
our

armies
of
pestilence
and
they
shall
strike
your
children
yet

enter
the
duke
of

and
the
duchess
duchess
my
lord
you
told
me
you
would
tell
the
rest
when
weeping
made
you
break
the
story
off
of
our
two
cousins
coming
into
london
york
where
did
i
leave
duchess
at
that
sad
stop
my
lord
where
rude
misgoverned
hands
from
windows
tops
threw
dust
and
rubbish
on
king
richard
head
york
then
as
i
said
the
duke
great
bolingbroke
mounted
upon
a
hot
and
fiery
steed
which
his
aspiring
rider
seem
to
know
with
slow
but
stately
pace
kept
on
his
course
whilst
all
tongues
cried
save
thee
bolingbroke
you
would
have
thought
the
very
windows
spake
so
many
greedy
looks
of
young
and
old
through
casements
darted
their
desiring
eyes
upon
his
visage
and
that
all
the
walls
with
painted
imagery
had
said
at
once
preserve
thee
welcome
bolingbroke
whilst
he
from
the
one
side
to
the
other
turning
bareheaded
lower
than
his
proud
steed
neck
bespake
them
thus
thank
you
countrymen
and
thus
still
doing
thus
he
pass
along
duchess
alack
poor
richard
where
rode
he
the
whilst
york
as
in
a
theatre
the
eyes
of
men
after
a
actor
leaves
the
stage
are
idly
bent
on
him
that
enters
next
thinking
his
prattle
to
be
tedious
even
so
or
with
much
more
contempt
men
eyes
did
scowl
on
gentle
richard
no
man
cried
save
him
no
joyful
tongue
gave
him
his
welcome
home
but
dust
was
thrown
upon
his
sacred
head
which
with
such
gentle
sorrow
he
shook
off
his
face
still
combating
with
tears
and
smiles
the
badges
of
his
grief
and
patience
that
had
not
god
for
some
strong
purpose
the
hearts
of
men
they
must
perforce
have
melted
and
barbarism
itself
have
pitied
him
but
heaven
hath
a
hand
in
these
events
to
whose
high
will
we
bound
our
calm
contents
to
bolingbroke

three
months
since

him
last
if

plague
hang
over
us

he
i
would
to
god
my
lords
he
might
be
found
inquire
at
london
the
taverns
there
for
there
they
say
he
daily
doth
frequent
with
unrestrained
loose
companions
even
such
they
say
as
stand
in
narrow
lanes
and
beat
our
watch
and
rob
our
passengers
which
he
young
wanton
and
effeminate
boy
takes
on
the
point
of
honour
to
support
so
dissolute
a
crew
percy
my
lord
some
two
days
since
i
saw
the
prince
and
told
him
of
those
triumphs
held
at
oxford
bolingbroke
and
what
said
the
gallant
percy
his
answer
was
he
would
unto
the
stews
and
from
the
creature
pluck
a
glove
and
wear
it
as
a
favour
and
with
that
he
would
unhorse
the
lustiest
challenger
bolingbroke
as
dissolute
as
desperate
yet
through
both
i
see
some
sparks
of
better
hope
which
elder
years
may
happily
bring
forth
but
who

enter

richard
king
richard
i
have
been
studying
how
i
may
compare
this
prison
where
i
live
unto
the
world
and
for
because
the
world
is
populous
and
here
is
not
a
creature
but
myself
i
can
not
do
it
yet
i
hammer
it
out
my
brain
i
prove
the
female
to
my
soul
my
soul
the
father
and
these
two
beget
a
generation
of
thoughts
and
these
same
thoughts
people
this
little
world
in
humours
like
the
people
of
this
world
for
no
thought
is
contented
the
better
sort
as
thoughts
of
things
divine
are
with
scruples
and
do
set
the
word
itself
against
the
word
as
thus
little
ones
and
then
again
is
as
hard
to
come
as
for
a
camel
to
thread
the
postern
of
a
small
needle
eye
thoughts
tending
to
ambition
they
do
plot
unlikely
wonders
how
these
vain
weak
nails
may
tear
a
passage
through
the
flinty
ribs
of
this
hard
world
my
ragged
prison
walls
and
for
they
can
not
die
in
their
own
pride
thoughts
tending
to
content
flatter
themselves
that
they
are
not
the
first
of
fortune
slaves
nor
shall
not
be
the
last
like
silly
beggars
who
sitting
in
the
stocks
refuge
their
shame
that
many
have
and
others
must
sit
there
and
in
this
thought
they
find
a
kind
of
ease
bearing
their
own
misfortunes
on
the
back
of
such
as
have
before
endur
the
like
thus
play
i
in
one
person
many
people
and
none
contented
sometimes
am
i
king
then
treasons
make
me
wish
myself
a
beggar
and
so
i
am
then
crushing
penury
persuades
me
i
was
better
when
a
king
then
am
i
king
again
and
by
and
by
think
that
i
am
unking
by
bolingbroke
and
straight
am
nothing
but
i
be
nor
i
nor
any
man
that

for

made
me
his
clock
my
thoughts
are
minutes
and
with
sighs
they
jar
their
watches
on
unto
mine
eyes
the
outward
watch
whereto
my
finger
like
a
dial
point
is
pointing
still
in
cleansing
them
from
tears
now
sir
the
sound
that
tells
what
hour
it
is
are
clamorous
groans
which
strike
upon
my
heart
which
is
the
bell
so
sighs
and
tears
and
groans
show
minutes
times
and
hours
but
my
time
runs
posting
on
in

proud
joy
while

me

men
mad

blessing
