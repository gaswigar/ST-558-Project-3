answerer
was
built
to
last
as
long
as
was
necessary
which
was
quite
long
as
some
races
judge
time
and
not
long
at
all
according
to
others
but
to
answerer
it
was
just
long
enough
as
to
size
answerer
was
large
to
some
and
small
to
others
he
could
be
viewed
as
complex
although
some
believed
that
he
was
really
very
simple
answerer
knew
that
he
was
as
he
should
be
above
and
beyond
all
else
he
was
the
answerer
he
knew
of
the
race
that
built
him
the
less
said
the
better
they
also
knew
and
never
said
whether
they
found
the
knowledge
pleasant
they
built
answerer
as
a
service
to
races
and
departed
in
a
unique
manner
where
they
went
only
answerer
knows
because
answerer
knows
everything
upon
his
planet
circling
his
sun
answerer
sat
duration
continued
long
as
some
judge
duration
short
as
others
judge
it
but
as
it
should
be
to
answerer
within
him
were
the
answers
he
knew
the
nature
of
things
and
why
things
are
as
they
are
and
what
they
are
and
what
it
all
means
answerer
could
answer
anything
provided
it
was
a
legitimate
question
and
he
wanted
to
he
was
eager
to
how
else
should
an
answerer
be
what
else
should
an
answerer
do
so
he
waited
for
creatures
to
come
and
ask
how
do
you
feel
sir
morran
asked
floating
gently
over
to
the
old
man
better
lingman
said
trying
to
smile
was
a
vast
relief
even
though
morran
had
expended
an
enormous
amount
of
fuel
getting
into
space
under
minimum
acceleration
lingman
feeble
heart
liked
it
lingman
heart
had
balked
and
sulked
pounded
angrily
against
the
brittle
hesitated
and
sped
up
it
seemed
for
a
time
as
though
lingman
heart
was
going
to
stop
out
of
sheer
pique
but
was
a
vast
relief
and
the
feeble
heart
was
going
again
morran
had
no
such
problems
his
strong
body
was
built
for
strain
and
stress
he
would
experience
them
on
this
trip
not
if
he
expected
old
lingman
to
live
i
going
to
live
lingman
muttered
in
answer
to
the
unspoken
question
long
enough
to
find
out
morran
touched
the
controls
and
the
ship
slipped
into
like
an
eel
into
oil
we
find
out
morran
murmured
he
helped
the
old
man
unstrap
himself
we
going
to
find
the
answerer
lingman
nodded
at
his
young
partner
they
had
been
reassuring
themselves
for
years
originally
it
had
been
lingman
project
then
morran
graduating
from
cal
tech
had
joined
him
together
they
had
traced
the
rumors
across
the
solar
system
the
legends
of
an
ancient
humanoid
race
who
had
known
the
answer
to
all
things
and
who
had
built
answerer
and
departed
think
of
it
morran
said
the
answer
to
everything
a
physicist
morran
had
many
questions
to
ask
answerer
the
expanding
universe
the
binding
force
of
atomic
nuclei
novae
and
supernovae
planetary
formation
red
shift
relativity
and
a
thousand
others
yes
lingman
said
he
pulled
himself
to
the
vision
plate
and
looked
out
on
the
bleak
prairie
of
the
illusory
he
was
a
biologist
and
an
old
man
he
had
two
questions
what
is
life
what
is
death
after
a
period
of
hunting
purple
lek
and
his
friends
gathered
to
talk
purple
always
ran
thin
in
the
neighborhood
of
stars
why
no
one
knew
so
talk
was
definitely
in
order
do
you
know
lek
said
i
think
i
hunt
up
this
answerer
lek
spoke
the
ollgrat
language
now
the
language
of
imminent
decision
why
ilm
asked
him
in
the
hvest
tongue
of
light
banter
why
do
you
want
to
know
things
is
the
job
of
gathering
purple
enough
for
you
no
lek
said
still
speaking
the
language
of
imminent
decision
it
is
not
the
great
job
of
lek
and
his
kind
was
the
gathering
of
purple
they
found
purple
imbedded
in
many
parts
of
the
fabric
of
space
minute
quantities
of
it
slowly
they
were
building
a
huge
mound
of
it
what
the
mound
was
for
no
one
knew
i
suppose
you
ask
him
what
purple
is
ilm
asked
pushing
a
star
out
of
his
way
and
lying
down
i
will
lek
said
we
have
continued
in
ignorance
too
long
we
must
know
the
true
nature
of
purple
and
its
meaning
in
the
scheme
of
things
we
must
know
why
it
governs
our
lives
for
this
speech
lek
switched
to
ilgret
the
language
of
ilm
and
the
others
did
try
to
argue
even
in
the
tongue
of
arguments
they
knew
that
the
knowledge
was
important
ever
since
the
dawn
of
time
lek
ilm
and
the
others
had
gathered
purple
now
it
was
time
to
know
the
ultimate
answers
to
the
universe
what
purple
was
and
what
the
mound
was
for
and
of
course
there
was
the
answerer
to
tell
them
everyone
had
heard
of
the
answerer
built
by
a
race
not
unlike
themselves
now
long
departed
will
you
ask
him
anything
else
ilm
asked
lek
i
do
know
lek
said
perhaps
i
ask
about
the
stars
really
nothing
else
important
since
lek
and
his
brothers
had
lived
since
the
dawn
of
time
they
did
consider
death
and
since
their
numbers
were
always
the
same
they
did
consider
the
question
of
life
but
purple
and
the
mound
i
go
lek
shouted
in
the
vernacular
of
good
fortune
his
brothers
shouted
back
in
the
jargon
of
lek
strode
off
leaping
from
star
to
star
alone
on
his
little
planet
answerer
sat
waiting
for
the
questioners
occasionally
he
mumbled
the
answers
to
himself
this
was
his
privilege
he
knew
but
he
waited
and
the
time
was
neither
too
long
nor
too
short
for
any
of
the
creatures
of
space
to
come
and
ask
there
were
eighteen
of
them
gathered
in
one
place
i
invoke
the
rule
of
eighteen
cried
one
and
another
appeared
who
had
never
before
been
born
by
the
rule
of
eighteen
we
must
go
to
the
answerer
one
cried
our
lives
are
governed
by
the
rule
of
eighteen
where
there
are
eighteen
there
will
be
nineteen
why
is
this
so
no
one
could
answer
where
am
i
asked
the
newborn
nineteenth
one
took
him
aside
for
instruction
that
left
seventeen
a
stable
number
and
we
must
find
out
cried
another
why
all
places
are
different
although
there
is
no
distance
that
was
the
problem
one
is
here
then
one
is
there
just
like
that
no
movement
no
reason
and
yet
without
moving
one
is
in
another
place
the
stars
are
cold
one
cried
why
we
must
go
to
the
answerer
for
they
had
heard
the
legends
knew
the
tales
once
there
was
a
race
a
good
deal
like
us
and
they
knew
and
they
told
answerer
then
they
departed
to
where
there
is
no
place
but
much
distance
how
do
we
get
there
the
newborn
nineteenth
cried
filled
now
with
knowledge
we
go
and
eighteen
of
them
vanished
one
was
left
moodily
he
stared
at
the
tremendous
spread
of
an
icy
star
then
he
too
vanished
those
old
legends
are
true
morran
gasped
there
it
is
they
had
come
out
of
at
the
place
the
legends
told
of
and
before
them
was
a
star
unlike
any
other
star
morran
invented
a
classification
for
it
but
it
did
matter
there
was
no
other
like
it
swinging
around
the
star
was
a
planet
and
this
too
was
unlike
any
other
planet
morran
invented
reasons
but
they
did
matter
this
planet
was
the
only
one
strap
yourself
in
sir
morran
said
i
land
as
gently
as
i
can
lek
came
to
answerer
striding
swiftly
from
star
to
star
he
lifted
answerer
in
his
hand
and
looked
at
him
so
you
are
answerer
he
said
yes
answerer
said
then
tell
me
lek
said
settling
himself
comfortably
in
a
gap
between
the
stars
tell
me
what
i
am
a
partiality
answerer
said
an
indication
come
now
lek
muttered
his
pride
hurt
you
can
do
better
than
that
now
then
the
purpose
of
my
kind
is
to
gather
purple
and
to
build
a
mound
of
it
can
you
tell
me
the
real
meaning
of
this
your
question
is
without
meaning
answerer
said
he
knew
what
purple
actually
was
and
what
the
mound
was
for
but
the
explanation
was
concealed
in
a
greater
explanation
without
this
lek
question
was
inexplicable
and
lek
had
failed
to
ask
the
real
question
lek
asked
other
questions
and
answerer
was
unable
to
answer
them
lek
viewed
things
through
his
specialized
eyes
extracted
a
part
of
the
truth
and
refused
to
see
more
how
to
tell
a
blind
man
the
sensation
of
green
answerer
did
try
he
was
supposed
to
finally
lek
emitted
a
scornful
laugh
one
of
his
little
flared
at
the
sound
then
faded
back
to
its
usual
intensity
lek
departed
striding
swiftly
across
the
stars
answerer
knew
but
he
had
to
be
asked
the
proper
questions
first
he
pondered
this
limitation
gazing
at
the
stars
which
were
neither
large
nor
small
but
exactly
the
right
size
the
proper
questions
the
race
which
built
answerer
should
have
taken
that
into
account
answerer
thought
they
should
have
made
some
allowance
for
semantic
nonsense
allowed
him
to
attempt
an
unravelling
answerer
contented
himself
with
muttering
the
answers
to
himself
eighteen
creatures
came
to
answerer
neither
walking
nor
flying
but
simply
appearing
shivering
in
the
cold
glare
of
the
stars
they
gazed
up
at
the
massiveness
of
answerer
if
there
is
no
distance
one
asked
then
how
can
things
be
in
other
places
answerer
knew
what
distance
was
and
what
places
were
but
he
answer
the
question
there
was
distance
but
not
as
these
creatures
saw
it
and
there
were
places
but
in
a
different
fashion
from
that
which
the
creatures
expected
rephrase
the
question
answerer
said
hopefully
why
are
we
short
here
one
asked
and
long
over
there
why
are
we
fat
over
there
and
short
here
why
are
the
stars
cold
answerer
knew
all
things
he
knew
why
stars
were
cold
but
he
explain
it
in
terms
of
stars
or
coldness
why
another
asked
is
there
a
rule
of
eighteen
why
when
eighteen
gather
is
another
produced
but
of
course
the
answer
was
part
of
another
greater
question
which
had
been
asked
another
was
produced
by
the
rule
of
eighteen
and
the
nineteen
creatures
vanished
answerer
mumbled
the
right
questions
to
himself
and
answered
them
we
made
it
morran
said
well
well
he
patted
lingman
on
the
shoulder
lightly
because
lingman
might
fall
apart
the
old
biologist
was
tired
his
face
was
sunken
yellow
lined
already
the
mark
of
the
skull
was
showing
in
his
prominent
yellow
teeth
his
small
flat
nose
his
exposed
cheekbones
the
matrix
was
showing
through
let
get
on
lingman
said
he
did
want
to
waste
any
time
he
did
have
any
time
to
waste
helmeted
they
walked
along
the
little
path
not
so
fast
lingman
murmured
right
morran
said
they
walked
together
along
the
dark
path
of
the
planet
that
was
different
from
all
other
planets
soaring
alone
around
a
sun
different
from
all
other
suns
up
here
morran
said
the
legends
were
explicit
a
path
leading
to
stone
steps
stone
steps
to
a
courtyard
and
then
the
answerer
to
them
answerer
looked
like
a
white
screen
set
in
a
wall
to
their
eyes
answerer
was
very
simple
lingman
clasped
his
shaking
hands
together
this
was
the
culmination
of
a
lifetime
work
financing
arguing
ferreting
bits
of
legend
ending
here
now
remember
he
said
to
morran
we
will
be
shocked
the
truth
will
be
like
nothing
we
have
imagined
i
ready
morran
said
his
eyes
rapturous
very
well
answerer
lingman
said
in
his
thin
little
voice
what
is
life
a
voice
spoke
in
their
heads
the
question
has
no
meaning
by
the
questioner
is
referring
to
a
partial
phenomenon
inexplicable
except
in
terms
of
its
whole
of
what
is
life
a
part
lingman
asked
this
question
in
its
present
form
admits
of
no
answer
questioner
is
still
considering
from
his
personal
limited
bias
answer
it
in
your
own
terms
then
morran
said
the
answerer
can
only
answer
questions
answerer
thought
again
of
the
sad
limitation
imposed
by
his
builders
silence
is
the
universe
expanding
morran
asked
confidently
is
a
term
inapplicable
to
the
situation
universe
as
the
questioner
views
it
is
an
illusory
concept
can
you
tell
us
morran
asked
i
can
answer
any
valid
question
concerning
the
nature
of
things
the
two
men
looked
at
each
other
i
think
i
know
what
he
means
lingman
said
sadly
our
basic
assumptions
are
wrong
all
of
them
they
ca
be
morran
said
physics
biology
partial
truths
lingman
said
with
a
great
weariness
in
his
voice
at
least
we
determined
that
much
we
found
out
that
our
inferences
concerning
observed
phenomena
are
wrong
but
the
rule
of
the
simplest
hypothesis
it
only
a
theory
lingman
said
but
life
he
certainly
could
answer
what
life
is
look
at
it
this
way
lingman
said
suppose
you
were
to
ask
was
i
born
under
the
constellation
scorpio
in
conjunction
with
saturn
i
would
be
unable
to
answer
your
question
terms
of
the
because
the
zodiac
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
i
see
morran
said
slowly
he
ca
answer
questions
in
terms
of
our
assumptions
that
seems
to
be
the
case
and
he
ca
alter
our
assumptions
he
is
limited
to
valid
questions
which
imply
it
would
seem
a
knowledge
we
just
do
have
we
ca
even
ask
a
valid
question
morran
asked
i
do
believe
that
we
must
know
some
basics
he
turned
to
answerer
what
is
death
i
can
not
explain
an
anthropomorphism
death
an
anthropomorphism
morran
said
and
lingman
turned
quickly
now
we
getting
somewhere
are
anthropomorphisms
unreal
he
asked
anthropomorphisms
may
be
classified
tentatively
as
a
false
truths
or
b
partial
truths
in
terms
of
a
partial
situation
which
is
applicable
here
both
that
was
the
closest
they
got
morran
was
unable
to
draw
any
more
from
answerer
for
hours
the
two
men
tried
but
truth
was
slipping
farther
and
farther
away
it
maddening
morran
said
after
a
while
this
thing
has
the
answer
to
the
whole
universe
and
he
ca
tell
us
unless
we
ask
the
right
question
but
how
are
we
supposed
to
know
the
right
question
lingman
sat
down
on
the
ground
leaning
against
a
stone
wall
he
closed
his
eyes
savages
that
what
we
are
morran
said
pacing
up
and
down
in
front
of
answerer
imagine
a
bushman
walking
up
to
a
physicist
and
asking
him
why
he
ca
shoot
his
arrow
into
the
sun
the
scientist
can
explain
it
only
in
his
own
terms
what
would
happen
the
scientist
would
even
attempt
it
lingman
said
in
a
dim
voice
he
would
know
the
limitations
of
the
questioner
it
fine
morran
said
angrily
how
do
you
explain
the
rotation
to
a
bushman
or
better
how
do
you
explain
relativity
to
him
maintaining
scientific
rigor
in
your
explanation
at
all
times
of
course
lingman
eyes
closed
did
answer
we
bushmen
but
the
gap
is
much
greater
here
worm
and
perhaps
the
worm
desires
to
know
the
nature
of
dirt
and
why
so
much
of
it
oh
well
shall
we
go
sir
morran
asked
lingman
eyes
remained
closed
his
taloned
fingers
were
clenched
his
cheeks
sunk
further
in
the
skull
was
emerging
sir
sir
and
answerer
knew
that
that
was
not
the
answer
alone
on
his
planet
which
is
neither
large
nor
small
but
exactly
the
right
size
answerer
waits
he
can
not
help
the
people
who
come
to
him
for
even
answerer
has
restrictions
he
can

his
builders
knew
and
forgot
in

to
