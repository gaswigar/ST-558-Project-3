they
saw

they
longed
to
go
and
see
it
ah
if
they
only
might
the
little
soft
white
clouds
heard
them
and
stepped
from
out
of
the
blue
and
each
laid
a
little
child
softly
upon
its
bosom
of
dew
and
they
carried
them
higher
and
higher
and
they
nothing
knew
any
more
until
they
were
standing
waiting
in
front
of
the
round
gold
door
and
they
knocked
and
called
and
entreated
whoever
should
be
within
but
all
to
no
purpose

no
one
would
hearken
to

the

family

let
me
introduce
you
to
this
little
dancing
family
for
morning
afternoon
and
night
they
danced
away
so
happily
they
twirled
round
about
they
turned
their
toes
out
the
people
wondered
what
the
noise
could
all
be
about
they
danced
from
early
morning
till
very
late
at
night
both
and
with
very
great
delight
and
every
sort
of
dance
they
knew
from
every
country
far
away
and
so
it
was
no
wonder
that
they
should
keep
dancing
all
the
day
so
dancing
dancing
dancing
in
sunshine
or
in
rain
and
when
they
all
left
off
why
then
they
all
began
again
illustration

going
to
see
grandmamma
little
molly
and
damon
are

so
far
for
they
going
to
see
their
kind
grandmamma
and
they
very
well
know
when
they
get
there
she
take
from
out
of
her
cupboard
some
very
nice
cake
and
into
her
garden
they
know
they
may
run
and
pick
some
red
currants
and
have
lots
of
fun
so
damon
to
doggie
says
how
do
you
do
and
asks
his
mamma
if
he
may
not
go
too
illustration
wishes
oh
if
you
were
a
little
boy
and
i
was
a
little
girl
why
you
would
have
some
whiskers
grow
and
then
my
hair
would
curl
ah
if
i
could
have
whiskers
grow
i
let
you
have
my
curls

to
begin
to
have
some
fun

the
bell
rings
sharp
and
clear
other
little
friends
appear

begin
to
feel
at
home
to
them
a
little
hard
is
fate
yet
better
early
than
too
late

tea
and
cake
all
gone

what
they
have
for

very
happy

you
be

you
much
enjoy
your

a
genteel
family
some
children
are
so
naughty
and
some
are
very
good
but
the
genteel
family
did
always
what
it
should
they
put
on
gloves
when
they
went
out
and
ran
not
in
the
street
and
on
wet
days
not
one
of
them
had
ever
muddy
feet
then
they
were
always
so
polite
and
always
thanked
you
so
and
never
threw
their
toys
about
as
naughty
children
do
they
always
learnt
their
lessons
when
it
was
time
they
should
and
liked
to
eat
up
all
their
crusts
they
were
so
very
good
and
then
their
frocks
were
never
torn
their
tuckers
always
clean
and
their
hair
so
very
tidy
always
quite
fit
to
be
seen
then
they
made
calls
with
their
mamma
and
were
so
very
neat
and
learnt
to
bow
becomingly
when
they
met
you
in
the
street
and
really
they
were
everything
that
children
ought
to
be
and
well
may
be
examples
now
for
little
you
