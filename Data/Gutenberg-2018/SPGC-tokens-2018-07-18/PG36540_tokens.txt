former
name
of
one
of
the
lakes
of
killarney
on
a
time
there
lived
a
king
and
a
queen
in
erin
and
they
had
an
only
son
they
were
very
careful
and
fond
of
this
son
whatever
he
asked
for
was
granted
and
what
he
wanted
he
had
when
grown
to
be
almost
a
young
man
the
son
went
away
one
day
to
the
hills
to
hunt
he
could
find
no
game
saw
nothing
all
day
towards
evening
he
sat
down
on
a
hillside
to
rest
but
soon
stood
up
again
and
started
to
go
home
then
he
heard
a
whistle
behind
him
and
turning
saw
a
giant
hurrying
down
the
hill
the
giant
came
to
him
took
his
hand
and
said
can
you
play
cards
i
can
indeed
said
the
king
son
well
if
you
can
said
the
giant
we
have
a
game
here
on
this
hillside
so
the
two
sat
down
and
the
giant
had
out
a
pack
of
cards
in
a
twinkling
what
shall
we
play
for
asked
the
giant
for
two
estates
answered
the
king
son
they
played
the
young
man
won
and
went
home
the
better
for
two
estates
he
was
very
glad
and
hurried
to
tell
his
father
the
luck
he
had
next
day
he
went
to
the
same
place
and
did
wait
long
till
the
giant
came
again
welcome
king
son
said
the
giant
what
shall
we
play
for
i
leave
that
to
yourself
answered
the
young
man
well
said
the
giant
i
have
five
hundred
bullocks
with
golden
horns
and
silver
hoofs
and
i
play
them
against
as
many
cattle
belonging
to
you
agreed
said
the
king
son
they
played
the
giant
lost
again
he
had
the
cattle
brought
to
the
place
and
the
king
son
went
home
with
the
five
hundred
bullocks
the
king
his
father
was
outside
watching
and
was
more
delighted
than
the
day
before
when
he
saw
the
drove
of
beautiful
cattle
with
horns
of
gold
and
hoofs
of
silver
when
the
bullocks
were
driven
in
the
king
sent
for
the
old
blind
sage
sean
dall
glic
to
know
what
he
would
say
of
the
young
man
luck
my
advice
said
the
old
blind
sage
is
not
to
let
your
son
go
the
way
of
the
giant
again
for
if
he
plays
with
him
a
third
time
he
rue
it
but
nothing
could
keep
the
king
son
from
playing
the
third
time
away
he
went
in
spite
of
every
advice
and
warning
and
sat
on
the
same
hillside
he
waited
long
but
no
one
came
at
last
he
rose
to
go
home
that
moment
he
heard
a
whistle
behind
him
and
turning
saw
the
giant
coming
well
will
you
play
with
me
asked
the
giant
i
would
said
the
king
son
but
i
have
nothing
to
bet
you
have
indeed
i
have
not
said
the
king
son
have
you
your
head
asked
the
giant
of
loch
léin
for
it
was
he
that
was
in
it
i
have
answered
the
king
son
so
have
i
my
head
said
the
giant
and
we
play
for
each
heads
this
third
time
the
giant
won
the
game
and
the
king
son
was
to
give
himself
up
in
a
year
and
a
day
to
the
giant
in
his
castle
the
young
man
went
home
sad
and
weary
the
king
and
queen
were
outside
watching
and
when
they
saw
him
approaching
they
knew
great
trouble
was
on
him
when
he
came
to
where
they
were
he
would
speak
but
went
straight
into
the
castle
and
would
eat
or
drink
he
was
sad
and
lamenting
for
a
good
while
till
at
last
he
disappeared
one
day
the
king
and
queen
knew
not
whither
after
that
they
hear
of
him
did
know
was
he
dead
or
alive
the
young
man
after
he
left
home
was
walking
along
over
the
kingdom
for
a
long
time
one
day
he
saw
no
house
big
or
little
till
after
dark
he
came
in
front
of
a
hill
and
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
saw
a
small
light
he
went
to
the
light
found
a
small
house
and
inside
an
old
woman
sitting
at
a
warm
fire
and
every
tooth
in
her
head
as
long
as
a
staff
she
stood
up
when
he
entered
took
him
by
the
hand
and
said
you
are
welcome
to
my
house
son
of
the
king
of
erin
then
she
brought
warm
water
washed
his
feet
and
legs
from
the
knees
down
gave
him
supper
and
put
him
to
bed
when
he
rose
next
morning
he
found
breakfast
ready
before
him
the
old
woman
said
you
were
with
me
last
night

with
my
sister
and
what
she
tells
you
to
do
do
or
your

in
danger

gift
i
give
you
here

a
ball
of
thread

throw
it
in

of
you
before

start
and
all
day
the
ball
will
be
rolling
ahead
of
you
and
you
be
following
behind
winding
the
thread
into
another
ball
he
obeyed
the
old
woman
threw
the
ball
down
and
followed
all
the
day
he
was
going
up
hill
and
down
across
valleys
and
open
places
keeping
the
ball
in
sight
and
winding
the
thread
as
he
went
till
evening
when
he
saw
a
hill
in
front
and
a
small
light
at
the
foot
of
it
he
went
to
the
light
and
found
a
house
which
he
entered
there
was
no
one
inside
but
an
old
woman
with
teeth
as
long
as
a
crutch
oh
then
you
are
welcome
to
my
house
king
son
of
erin
said
she
you
were
with
my
sister
last
night

are
with
me
and
glad
i
am
to
see
you
she
gave
him
meat
and
drink
and
a
good
bed
to
lie
on
when
he
rose
next
morning
breakfast
was
there
before
him
and
when
he
had
eaten
and
was
ready
for
the
journey
the
old
woman
gave
him
a
ball
of
thread
saying
you
were
with
my
younger
sister
the
night
before
last
you
were
with
me
last
night
and
you
be
with
my
elder
sister
you
must
do
what
she
tells
you
or
you
lose
your
head
you
must
throw
this
ball
before
you
and
follow
the
clew
till
evening
he
threw
down
the
ball
it
rolled
on
showing
the
way
up
and
down
mountains
and
hills
across
valleys
and
braes
all
day
he
wound
the
ball
unceasingly
it
went
till
nightfall
when
he
came
to
a
light
found
a
little
house
and
went
in
inside
was
an
old
woman
the
eldest
sister
who
said
you
are
welcome
and
glad
am
i
to
see
you
king
son
she
treated
him
as
well
as
the
other
two
had
done
after
he
had
eaten
breakfast
next
morning
she
said
i
know
well
the
journey
you
are
on
you
have
lost
your
head
to
the
giant
of
loch
léin
and
you
are
going
to
give
yourself
up
this
giant
has
a
great
castle
around
the
castle
are
seven
hundred
iron
spikes
and
on
every
spike
of
them
but
one
is
the
head
of
a
king
a
queen
or
a
king
son
the
seven
hundredth
spike
is
empty
and
nothing
can
save
your
head
from
that
spike
if
you
do
take
my
advice
here
is
a
ball
for
you
walk
behind
it
till
you
come
to
a
lake
near
the
giant
castle
when
you
come
to
that
lake
at
midday
the
ball
will
be
unwound
the
giant
has
three
young
daughters
and
they
come
at
noon
every
day
of
the
year
to
bathe
in
the
lake
you
must
watch
them
well
for
each
will
have
a
lily
on
her
breast
one
a
blue
another
a
white
and
the
third
a
yellow
lily
you
must
let
your
eyes
off
the
one
with
the
yellow
lily
watch
her
well
when
she
undresses
to
go
into
the
water
see
where
she
puts
her
clothes
when
the
three
are
out
in
the
lake
swimming
do
you
slip
away
with
the
clothes
of
yellow
lily
when
the
sisters
come
out
from
bathing
and
find
that
the
one
with
the
yellow
lily
has
lost
her
clothes
the
other
two
will
laugh
and
make
game
of
her
and
she
will
crouch
down
crying
on
the
shore
with
nothing
to
cover
her
and
say
can
i
go
home
now
and
everybody
making
sport
of
me
whoever
took
my
clothes
if
he
give
them
back
to
me
i
save
him
from
the
danger
he
is
in
if
i
have
the
power
the
king
son
followed
the
ball
till
nearly
noon
when
it
stopped
at
a
lake
not
far
from
the
giant
castle
then
he
hid
behind
a
rock
at
the
water
edge
and
waited
at
midday
the
three
sisters
came
to
the
lake
and
leaving
their
clothes
on
the
strand
went
into
the
water
when
all
three
were
in
the
lake
swimming
and
playing
with
great
pleasure
and
sport
the
king
son
slipped
out
and
took
the
clothes
of
the
sister
with
the
yellow
lily
after
they
had
bathed
in
the
lake
to
their
hearts
content
the
three
sisters
came
out
when
the
two
with
the
blue
and
the
white
lilies
saw
their
sister
on
the
shore
and
her
clothes
gone
they
began
to
laugh
and
make
sport
of
her
then
cowering
and
crouching
down
she
began
to
cry
and
lament
saying
how
can
i
go
home
now
with
my
own
sisters
laughing
at
me
if
i
stir
from
this
everybody
will
see
me
and
make
sport
of
me
the
sisters
went
home
and
left
her
there
when
they
were
gone
and
she
was
alone
at
the
water
crying
and
sobbing
all
at
once
she
came
to
herself
and
called
out
whoever
took
my
clothes
i
forgive
him
if
he
brings
them
to
me
now
and
i
save
him
from
the
danger
he
is
in
if
i
can
when
he
heard
this
the
king
son
put
the
clothes
out
to
her
and
stayed
behind
himself
till
she
told
him
to
come
forth
then
she
said
i
know
well
where
you
are
going

father

giant
of
loch

a
soft
bed
waiting

water
and
wait
till

when
he
comes
home
and
asks

but
go
to

in
the
tank
when
he
tells
you
the
giant
daughter
left
the
king
son
who
went
his
way
to
the
castle
alone
at
a
fair
and
easy
gait
for
he
had
time
enough
on
his
hands
and
to
spare
when
the
giant
of
loch
léin
came
home
that
night
the
first

said
the
king
son
well

then
and
i
show

bed
he
went
and
the
giant
put
the
king
son
into
the
deep
tank
of
water
to
drown
and
being
tired
himself
from
hunting
all
day
over
the
mountains
and
hills
of
erin
he
went
to
sleep
that
minute
his
youngest
daughter
came
took
the
king
son
out
of
the
tank
placed
plenty
to
eat
and
to
drink
before
him
and
gave
him
a
good
bed
to
sleep
on
that
night
the
giant
daughter
watched
till
she
heard
her
father
stirring
before
daybreak
then
she
roused
the
king

put
him
in

the
birds
the
king
son
took
the
new
whistle
and
set
out
over
the
hills
and
valleys
whistling
as
he
went
but
no
matter
how
he
whistled
not
a
bird
came
near
him
at
last
tired
and
worn
out
with
travelling
and
whistling
he
sat
down
on
a
hillock
and
began
to
cry
that
moment
yellow
lily
was
at
his
side
with
a
cloth
which
she
spread
out
and
there
was
a
grand
meal
before
him
he
had
finished
eating
and
drinking
before
the
stable
was
thatched
with
birds
feathers
and
no
two
of
them
of
one
color
or
kind
when
he
came
home
that
evening
the
giant
called
out
have
you
the
stable
thatched
for
me
i
have
indeed
said
the
king
son
and
small
trouble
i
had
with
it
if
that
true
said
the
giant
either
the
devil
or
my
daughter
helped
you
it
was
my
own
strength
and
not
the
devil
or
your
daughter
that
helped
me
said
the
king
son
he
spent
that
night
as
he
had
the
two
nights
before
next
morning
when
the
giant
found
him
alive
in
the
tank
he
said
there
is
great
work
before
you
which
you
must
do
or
your
head
be
on
the
spike
below
here
under
my
castle
is
a
tree
nine
hundred
feet
high
and
there
is
a
limb
on
that
tree
from
the
roots
up
except
one
small
limb
at
the
very
top
where
there
is
a
crow
nest
the
tree
is
covered
with
glass
from
the
ground
to
the
crow
nest
in
the
nest
is
one
egg
you
must
have
that
egg
before
me
here
for
my
supper
or
i
have
your
head
on
the
seven
hundredth
spike
the
giant
went
hunting
and
the
king
son
went
down
to
the
tree
tried
to
shake
it
but
could
not
make
it
stir
then
he
tried
to
climb
but
no
use
it
was
all
slippery
glass
then
he
thought
sure
i
done
for
now
i
must
lose
my
head
this
time
he
stood
there
in
sadness
when
yellow
lily
came
and
said
how
are
you
thriving
in
your
work
i
can
do
nothing
said
the
king
son
well
all
that
we
have
done
up
to
this
time
is
nothing
to
climbing
this
tree
but
first
of
all
let
us
sit
down
together
and
eat
and
then
talk
said
yellow
lily
they
sat
down
she
spread
the
cloth
again
and
they
had
a
splendid
feast
when
the
feast
was
over
she
took
out
a
knife
from
her
pocket
and
said
now
you
must
kill
me
strip
the
flesh
from
my
bones
take
all
the
bones
apart
and
use
them
as
steps
for
climbing
the
tree
when
you
are
climbing
the
tree
they
will
stick
to
the
glass
as
if
they
had
grown
out
of
it
but
when
you
are
coming
down
and
have
put
your
foot
on
each
one
they
will
drop
into
your
hand
when
you
touch
them
be
sure
and
stand
on
each
bone
leave
none
untouched
if
you
do
it
will
stay
behind
put
all
my
flesh
into
this
clean
cloth
by
the
side
of
the
spring
at
the
roots
of
the
tree
when
you
come
to
the
earth
arrange
my
bones
together
put
the
flesh
over
them
sprinkle
it
with
water
from
the
spring
and
i
shall
be
alive
and
well
before
you
but
do
forget
a
bone
of
me
on
the
tree
how
could
i
kill
you
asked
the
king
son
after
what
you
have
done
for
me
if
you
wo
obey
you
and
i
are
done
for
said
yellow
lily
you
must
climb
the
tree
or
we
are
lost
and
to
climb
the
tree
you
must
do
as
i
say
the
king
son
obeyed
he
killed
yellow
lily
cut
the
flesh
from
her
body
and
unjointed
the
bones
as
she
had
told
him
as
he
went
up
the
king
son
put
the
bones
of
yellow
lily
body
against
the
side
of
the
tree
using
them
as
steps
till
he
came
under
the
nest
and
stood
on
the
last
bone
then
he
took
the
crow
egg
and
coming
down
put
his
foot
on
every
bone
then
took
it
with
him
till
he
came
to
the
last
bone
which
was
so
near
the
ground
that
he
failed
to
touch
it
with
his
foot
he
now
placed
all
the
bones
of
yellow
lily
in
order
again
at
the
side
of
the
spring
put
the
flesh
on
them
sprinkled
it
with
water
from
the
spring
she
rose
up
before
him
and
said
did
i
tell
you
not
to
leave
a
bone
of
my
body
without
stepping
on
it
now
i
am
lame
for
life
you
left
my
little
toe
on
the
tree
without
touching
it
and
i
have
but
nine
toes
when
the
giant
came
home
that
night
the
first
words
he
had
were
have
you
the
crow
egg
for
my
supper
i
have
said
the
king
son
if
you
have
then
either
the
devil
or
my
daughter
is
helping
you
it
is
my
own
strength
that
helping
me
said
the
king
son
well
whoever
it
is
i
must
forgive
you
now
and
your
head
is
your
own
so
the
king
son
was
free
to
go
his
own
road
and
away
he
went
and
never
stopped
till
he
came
home
to
his
own
father
and
mother
who
had
a
great
welcome
before
him
and
why
not
for
they
thought
he
was
dead
when
the
son
was
at
home
a
time
the
king
called
up
the
old
blind
sage
and
asked
what
must
i
do
with
my
son
now
if
you
follow
my
advice
said
the
old
blind
sage
you
find
a
wife
for
him
and
then
he
not
go
roaming
away
again
and
leave
you
as
he
did
before
the
king
was
pleased
with
the
advice
and
he
sent
a
message

giant
of
loch
léin
i
have
her
and
no
other
woman
your
daughter

my
father
guest
and
no
worse
but
better
for
having
come
to
a
wedding
in
erin
the
king
son
married
yellow
lily
daughter
of
the
giant
of
loch
léin
the
wedding
lasted
long
and
all
were
happy
the
three
daughters
of
king
there
was
a
king
in
desmond
whose
name
was
coluath
and
he
had
three
daughters
on
a
time
when
the
king
was
away
from
home
the
eldest
daughter
took
a
thought
that
she
like
to
be
married
so
she
went
up
in
the
castle
put
on
the
cloak
of
darkness
which
her
father
had
and
wished
for
the
most
beautiful
man
under
the
sun
as
a
husband
for
herself
she
got
her
wish
for
scarcely
had
she
put
off
the
cloak
of
darkness
when
there
came
in
a
golden
coach
with
four
horses
two
black
and
two
white
the
finest
man
she
had
ever
laid
eyes
on
and
took
her
away
when
the
second
daughter
saw
what
had
happened
to
her
sister
she
put
on
the
cloak
of
darkness
and
wished
for
the
next
best
man
in
the
world
as
a
husband
she
put
off
the
cloak
and
straightway
there
came
in
a
golden
coach
with
four
black
horses
a
man
nearly
as
good
as
the
first
and
took
her
away
the
third
sister
put
on
the
cloak
and
wished
for
the
best
white
dog
in
the
world
presently
he
came
with
one
man
attending
in
a
golden
coach
and
four
horses
and
took
the
youngest
sister
away
when
the
king
came
home
the
told
him
what
had
happened
while
he
was
gone
he
was
enraged
beyond
measure
when
he
heard
that
his
youngest
daughter
had
wished
for
a
white
dog
and
gone
off
with
him
when
the
first
man
brought
his
wife
home
he
asked
in
what
form
will
you
have
me
in
the
daytime
as
i
am
now
in
the
daytime
or
as
i
am
now
at
night
as
you
are
now
in
the
daytime
so
the
first
sister
had
her
husband
as
a
man
in
the
daytime
but
at
night
he
was
a
seal
the
second
man
put
the
same
question
to
the
middle
sister
and
got
the
same
answer
so
the
second
sister
had
her
husband
in
the
same
form
as
the
first
when
the
third
sister
came
to
where
the
white
dog
lived
he
asked
her
how
will
you
have
me
to
be
in
the
daytime
as
i
am
now
in
the
day
or
as
i
am
now
at
night
as
you
are
now
in
the
day
so
the
white
dog
was
a
dog
in
the
daytime
but
the
most
beautiful
of
men
at
night
after
a
time
the
third
sister
had
a
son
and
one
day
when
her
husband
was
going
out
to
hunt
he
warned
her
that
if
anything
should
happen
the
child
not
to
shed
a
tear
on
that
account
while
he
was
gone
a
great
gray
crow
that
used
to
haunt
the
place
came
and
carried
the
child
away
when
it
was
a
week
old
remembering
the
warning
she
shed
not
a
tear
for
the
loss
all
went
on
as
before
till
another
son
was
born
the
husband
used
to
go
hunting
every
day
and
again
he
said
she
must
not
shed
a
tear
if
anything
happened
when
the
child
was
a
week
old
a
great
gray
crow
came
and
bore
him
away
but
the
mother
did
not
cry
or
drop
a
tear
all
went
well
till
a
daughter
was
born
when
she
was
a
week
old
a
great
gray
crow
came
and
swept
her
away
this
time
the
mother
dropped
one
tear
on
a
handkerchief
which
she
took
out
of
her
pocket
and
then
put
back
again
when
the
husband
came
home
from
hunting
and
heard
what
the
crow
had
done
he
asked
the
wife
have
you
shed
tears
this
time
i
have
dropped
one
tear
said
she
then
he
was
very
angry
for
he
knew
what
harm
she
had
done
by
dropping
that
one
tear
soon
after
their
father
invited
the
three
sisters
to
visit
him
and
be
present
at
a
great
feast
in
their
honor
they
sent
messages
each
from
her
own
place
that
they
would
come
the
king
was
very
glad
at
the
prospect
of
seeing
his
children
but
the
queen
was
grieved
and
thought
it
a
great
disgrace
that
her
youngest
daughter
had
no
one
to
come
home
with
her
but
a
white
dog
the
white
dog
was
in
dread
that
the
king
would
leave
him
inside
with
the
company
but
would
drive
him
from
the
castle
to
the
yard
and
that
the
dogs
outside
would
leave
a
patch
of
skin
on
his
back
but
would
tear
the
life
out
of
him
the
youngest
daughter
comforted
him
there
is
no
danger
to
you
said
she
for
wherever
i
am
you
be
and
wherever
you
go
i
follow
and
take
care
of
you
when
all
was
ready
for
the
feast
at
the
castle
and
the
company
were
assembled
the
king
was
for
banishing
the
white
dog
but
the
youngest
daughter
would
not
listen
to
her
father
would
not
let
the
white
dog
out
of
her
sight
but
kept
him
near
her
at
the
feast
and
divided
with
him
the
food
that
came
to
herself
when
the
feast
was
over
and
all
the
guests
had
gone
the
three
sisters
went
to
their
own
rooms
in
the
castle
late
in
the
evening
the
queen
took
the
cook
with
her
and
stole
in
to
see
what
was
in
her
daughters
rooms
they
were
all
asleep
at
the
time
what
should
she
see
by
the
side
of
her
youngest
daughter
but
the
most
beautiful
man
she
had
ever
laid
eyes
on
then
she
went
to
where
the
other
two
daughters
were
sleeping
and
there
instead
of
the
two
men
who
brought
them
to
the
feast
were
two
seals
fast
asleep
the
queen
was
greatly
troubled
at
the
sight
of
the
seals
when
she
and
the
cook
were
returning
they
came
upon
the
skin
of
the
white
dog
she
caught
it
up
as
she
went
and
threw
it
into
the
kitchen
fire
the
skin
was
not
five
minutes
in
the
fire
when
it
gave
a
crack
that
woke
not
only
all
in
the
castle
but
all
in
the
country
for
miles
around
the
husband
of
the
youngest
daughter
sprang
up
he
was
very
angry
and
very
sorry
and
said
if
i
had
been
able
to
spend
three
nights
with
you
under
your
father
roof
i
should
have
got
back
my
own
form
again
for
good
and
could
have
been
a
man
both
in
the
day
and
the
night
but
now
i
must
go
he
rose
from
the
bed
ran
out
of
the
castle
and
away
he
went
as
fast
as
ever
his
two
legs
could
carry
him
overtaking
the
one
before
him
and
leaving
the
one
behind
he
was
this
way
all
that
night
and
the
next
day
but
he
could
leave
the
wife
for
she
followed
from
the
castle
was
after
him
in
the
night
and
the
day
too
and
never
lost
sight
of
him
in
the
afternoon
he
turned
and
told
her
to
go
back
to
her
father
but
she
would
not
listen
to
him
at
nightfall
they
came
to
the
first
house
they
had
seen
since
leaving
the
castle
he
turned
and
said
do
you

of
a
hill
where
the

received
a
good
welcome
after
she
had
eaten
supper
a
little
girl
with
only
one
eye
came
to
her
knee
and
said
mother
the
princess
began
to
cry
at
sight
of
the
child
thinking
that
she
herself
was
the
cause
that
it
had
but
one
eye
then
she
put
her
hand
into
her
pocket
where
she
kept
the
handkerchief
on
which
she
had
dropped
the
tear
when
the
gray
crow
carried
her
infant
away
she
had
never

the
eye
in

into
the
socket
that
minute
and
the

saw
out
of

he
told

stopped
there
sitting
on
the
mound
lamenting
till

she
bethought
herself
and
going
to
the
rushes
pulled
up
a
stalk

her
husband
and
never
stopped
till
she
came
to
the
lower
land
after
a
while
she
reached
a
small
house
near
a
splendid
castle
she
went
into
the
house
and
asked

around
the
washerwoman
house
to
play
the
child
looked
so
poor
and
her
clothes
were
so
torn
and
dirty
that
the
princess
took
pity
on
her
and
cut
the
clothes
with
the
scissors
which
she
had
that
moment
the
most
beautiful
dress
of
cloth
of

has
a
pair
of
scissors

of
in
this
country
when
the

next
day
another
daughter
of
the
henwife
went
to
the
washerwoman

white
hill
there
was
once
a
weaver
in
erin
who
lived
at
the
edge
of
a
wood
and
on
a
time
when
he
had
nothing
to
burn
he
went
out
with
his
daughter
to
get
fagots
for
the
fire
they
gathered
two
bundles
and
were
ready
to
carry
them
home
when
who
should
come
along
but
a
stranger
on
horseback
and
he
said
to
the
weaver
my
good
man
will
you
give
me
that
girl
of
yours
indeed
then
i
will
not
said
the
weaver
i
give
you
her
weight
in
gold
said
the
stranger
and
he
put
out
the
gold
there
on
the
ground
so
the
weaver
went
home
with
the
gold
and
without
the
daughter
he
buried
the
gold
in
the
garden
without
letting
his
wife
know
what
he
had
done
when
she
asked
where
is
our
daughter
the
weaver
said
i
sent
her
on
an
errand
to
a
neighbor
house
for
things
that
i
want
night
came
but
no
sight
of
the
girl
the
next
time
he
went
for
fagots
the
weaver
took
his
second
daughter
to
the
wood
and
when
they
had
two
bundles
gathered
and
were
ready
to
go
home
a
second
stranger
came
on
horseback
much
finer
than
the
first
and
asked
the
weaver
would
he
give
him
his
daughter
i
will
not
said
the
weaver
well
said
the
stranger
i
give
you
her
weight
in
silver
if
you
let
her
go
with
me
and
he
put
the
silver
down
before
him
the
weaver
carried
home
the
silver
and
buried
it
in
the
garden
with
the
gold
and
the
daughter
went
away
with
the
man
on
horseback
when
he
went
again
to
the
wood
the
weaver
took
his
third
daughter
with
him
and
when
they
were
ready
to
go
home
a
third
man
came
on
horseback
gave
the
weight
of
the
third
daughter
in
copper
and
took
her
away
the
weaver
buried
the
copper
with
the
gold
and
silver
now
the
wife
was
lamenting
and
moaning
night
and
day
for
her
three
daughters
and
gave
the
weaver
no
rest
till
he
told
the
whole
story
now
a
son
was
born
to
them
and
when
the
boy
grew
up
and
was
going
to
school
he
heard
how
his
three
sisters
had
been
carried
away
for
their
weight
in
gold
and
silver
and
copper
and
every
day
when
he
came
home
he
saw
how
his
mother
was
lamenting
and
wandering
outside
in
grief
through
the
fields
and
pits
and
ditches
so
he
asked
her
what
trouble
was
on
her
but
she
would
tell
him
a
word
at
last
he
came
home
crying
from
school
one
day
and
said
i
not
sleep
three
nights
in
one
house
till
i
find
my
three
sisters
then
he
said
to
his
mother
make
me
three
loaves
of
bread
mother
for
i
am
going
on
a
journey
next
day
he
asked
had
she
the
bread
ready
she
said
she
had
and
she
was
crying
bitterly
all
the
time
i
going
to
leave
you
now
mother
said
he
and
i
come
back
when
i
have
found
my
three
sisters
he
went
away
and
walked
on
till
he
was
tired
and
hungry
and
then
he
sat
down
to
eat
the
bread
that
his
mother
had
given
him
when
a
man
came
up
and
asked
him
for
something
to
eat
sit
down
here
said
the
boy
he
sat
down
and
the
two
ate
till
there
was
not
a
crumb
of
the
bread
left
the
boy
told
of
the
journey
he
was
on
then
the
man
said
there
may
not
be
much
use
in
your
going
but
here
are
three
things
that
serve
you
the
sword
of
sharpness
the
cloth
of
plenty
and
the
cloak
of
darkness
no
man
can
kill
you
while
that
sword
is
in
your
hand
and
whenever
you
are
hungry
or
dry
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
spread
the
cloth
and
ask
for
what
you
like
to
eat
or
drink
and
it
will
be
there
before
you
when
you
put
on
the
cloak
there
wo
be
a
man
or
a
woman
or
a
living
thing
in
the
world
that
see
you
and
you
go
to
whatever
place
you
have
set
your
mind
on
quicker
than
any
wind
the
man
went
his
way
and
the
boy
travelled
on
before
evening
a
great
shower
came
and
he
ran
for
shelter
to
a
large
when
he
got
near
the
tree
his
foot
slipped
the
ground
opened
and
down
he
went
through
the
earth
till
he
came
to
another
country
when
he
was
in

other
country
he
put
on
the
cloak
of
darkness
and
went
ahead
like
a
blast
of
wind
and
never
stopped
till
he
saw
a
castle
in
the
distance
and
soon
he
was
there
but
he
found
nine
gates
closed
before
him
and
no
way
to
go
through
it
was
written
inside
the
cloak
of
darkness
that
his
eldest
sister
lived
in
that
castle
he
was
not
long
at
the
gate
looking
in
when
a

came
to
him
and

in
and
the
noise
of
him
was
terrible
he
came

cloth
of
plenty
and
asked

took
up
the
cloth

on
the
cloak
of
darkness
and
went
ahead
passing
every
wind
that
was
before
him
and
leaving
every
wind
that
was
behind
about
an
hour
before

saw
the
castle
in
which
his
second
sister
lived
when

out
to
him
and

noise
and
in

the
man
of
the
castle
in
the
form
of
a
tremendous
salmon

went
flapping
upstairs

there
till

a
man
who

the
man
they
supped
and
then

till
morning
when
the
man
of
the
castle
was
going
out
again
in
the
form
of
a
great
salmon
he
turned
to
the
boy
and
said
you

a
while

house
till

piece
of

to
the
boy
saying
if

sea
to

they
parted
the
boy
put
on
his
cloak
of
darkness
and
away
he
went
more
swiftly
than
any
wind
he
never
stopped
till
he
was
hungry
and
thirsty
then
he
sat
down
took
off
his
cloak
of
darkness
spread
the
cloth
of
plenty
and
ate
his
fill
when
he
had
eaten
he
went
on
again
till
near
sundown
when
he
saw
the
castle
where
his
third
sister
lived
all
three
castles
were
near
the
sea
neither
sister
knew
what
place
she
was
in
and
neither
knew
where
the
other
two
were
living
the
third
sister
took
her
brother
in
just
as
the
first
and
second
had
done
telling
him
not
to
wonder
at
anything
he
saw
they
were
not
long
inside
when
a
roaring
noise
was
heard
and
in
came
the
greatest
eagle
that
ever
was
seen
the
eagle
hurried
upstairs
and
soon
came
down
a
man
who
is
that
stranger
there
with
you
asked
he
of
the
wife
he
as
well
as
the
ram
and
salmon
knew
the
boy
he
only
wanted
to
try
his
wife
this
is
my
brother
who
has
come
to
see
me
they
all
took
supper
and
slept
that
night
when
the
eagle
was
going
away
in
the
morning
he
pulled
a
feather
out
of
his
wing
and
said
to
the
boy
keep
this
it
may
serve
you
if
you
are
ever
in
straits
and
want
help
call
on
what
eagles
are
in
the
world
and
they
come
to
you
there
was
no
hurry
now
for
the
third
sister
was
found
and
the
boy
went
upstairs
with
her
to
examine
the
country
all
around
and
to
look
at
the
sea
soon
he
saw
a
great
white
hill
and
on
the
top
of
the
hill
a
castle
in
that
castle
on
the
white
hill
beyond
said
the
sister
lives
a
giant
who
stole
from
her
home
the
most
beautiful
young
woman
in
the
world
from
all
parts
the
greatest
heroes
and
champions
and
kings
sons
are
coming
to
take
her
away
from
the
giant
and
marry
her
there
is
not
a
man
of
them
all
who
is
able
to
conquer
the
giant
and
free
the
young
woman
but
the
giant
conquers
them
cuts
their
heads
off
and
then
eats
their
flesh
when
he
has
picked
the
bones
clean
he
throws
them
out
and
the
whole
place
around
the
castle
is
white
with
the
bones
of
the
men
that
the
giant
has
eaten
i
must
go
said
the
boy
to
that
castle
to
know
can
i
kill
the
giant
and
bring
away
the
young
woman
so
he
took
leave
of
his
sister
put
on
the
cloak
of
darkness
took
his
sword
with
him
and
was
soon
inside
the
castle
the
giant
was
fighting
with
champions
outside
when
the
boy
saw
the
young
woman
he
took
off
the
cloak
of
darkness
and
spoke
to
her
oh
said
she
what
can
you
do
against
the
giant
no
man
has
ever
come
to
this
castle
without
losing
his
life
the
giant
kills
every
man
and
no
one
has
ever
come
here
so
big
that
the
giant
did
not
eat
him
at
one
meal
and
is
there
no
way
to
kill
him
asked
the
boy
i
think
not
said
she
well
if
you
give
me
something
to
eat
i
stay
here
and
when
the
giant
comes
in
i
do
my
best
to
kill
him
but
do
let
on
that
i
am
here
then
he
put
on
the
cloak
of
darkness
and
no
one
could
see
him
when
the
giant
came
in
he
had
the
bodies
of
two
men
on
his
back
he
threw
down
the
bodies
and
told
the
young
woman
to
get
them
ready
for
his
dinner
then
he
snuffed
around
and
said
there
some
one
here
i
smell
the
blood
of
an
erineach
i
do
think
you
do
said
the
young
woman
i
ca
see
any
one
neither
can
i
said
the
giant
but
i
smell
a
man
with
that
the
boy
drew
his
sword
and
when
the
giant
was
struck
he
ran
in
the
direction
of
the
blow
to
give
one
back
then
he
was
struck
on
the
other
side
they
were
at
one
another
this
way
the
giant
and
the
boy
with
the
cloak
of
darkness
on
him
till
the
giant
had
fifty
wounds
and
was
covered
with
blood
every
minute
he
was
getting
a
slash
of
a
sword
but
never
could
give
one
back
at
last
he
called
out
whoever
you
are
wait
till
and
i
face
you
then
so
the
fighting
stopped
and
the
young
woman
began
to
cry
and
lament
as
if
her
heart
would
break
when
she
saw
the
state
the
giant
was
in
oh
you
be
with
me
no
longer
you
be
killed
now
what
can
i
do
alone
without
you
and
she
tried
to
please
him
and
washed
his
wounds
do
be
afraid
said
the
giant
this
one
whoever
he
is
will
not
kill
me
for
there
is
no
man
in
the
world
that
can
kill
me
then
the
giant
went
to
bed
and
was
well
in
the
morning
next
day
the
giant
and
the
boy
began
in
the
middle
of
the
forenoon
and
fought
till
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
the
giant
was
covered
with
wounds
and
he
had
not
given
one
blow
to
the
boy
and
could
not
see
him
for
he
was
always
in
his
cloak
of
darkness
so
the
giant
had
to
ask
for
rest
till
next
morning
while
the
young
woman
was
washing
and
dressing
the
wounds
of
the
giant
she
cried
and
lamented
all
the
time
saying
what
become
of
me
now
i
afraid
you
be
killed
this
time
and
how
can
i
live
here
without
you
have
no
fear
for
me
said
the
giant
i
put
your
mind
at
rest
in
the
bottom
of
the
sea
is
a
chest
locked
and
bound
in
that
chest
is
a
duck
in
the
duck
an
egg
and
i
never
can
be
killed
unless
some
one
gets
the
egg
from
the
duck
in
the
chest
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
and
rubs
it
on
the
mole
that
is
under
my
right
breast
while
the
giant
was
telling
this
to
the
woman
to
put
her
mind
at
rest
who
should
be
listening
to
the
story
but
the
boy
in
the
cloak
of
darkness
the
minute
he
heard
of
the
chest
in
the
sea
he
thought
of
the
salmons
so
off
he
hurried
to
the
seashore
which
was
not
far
away
then
he
took
out
the
fin
that
his
eldest
sister
husband
had
given
him
and
called
on
what
salmons
were
in
the
sea
to
bring
up
the
chest
with
the
duck
inside
and
put
it
out
on
the
beach
before
him
he
had
not
long
to
wait
till
he
saw
nothing
but
salmon
the
whole
sea
was
covered
with
them
moving
to
land
and
they
put
the
chest
out
on
the
beach
before
him
but
the
chest
was
locked
and
strong
how
could
he
open
it
he
thought
of
the
rams
and
taking
out
the
lock
of
wool
said
i
want
what
rams
are
in
the
world
to
come
and
break
open
this
chest
that
minute
the
rams
of
the
world
were
running
to
the
seashore
each
with
a
terrible
pair
of
horns
on
him
and
soon
they
battered
the
chest
to
splinters
out
flew
the
duck
and
away
she
went
over
the
sea
the
boy
took
out
the
feather
and
said
i
want
what
eagles
are
in
the
world
to
get
me
the
egg
from
that
duck
that
minute
the
duck
was
surrounded
by
the
eagles
of
the
world
and
the
egg
was
soon
brought
to
the
boy
he
put
the
feather
the
wool
and
the
fin
in
his
pocket
put
on
the
cloak
of
darkness
and
went
to
the
castle
on
the
white
hill
and
told
the
young
woman
when
she
was
dressing
the
wounds
of
the
giant
again
to
raise
up
his
arm
next
day
they
fought
till
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
the
giant
was
almost
cut
to
pieces
and
called
for
a
cessation
the
young
woman
hurried
to
dress
the
wounds
and
he
said
i
see
you
would
help
me
if
you
could
you
are
not
able
but
never
fear
i
shall
not
be
killed
then
she
raised
his
arm
to
wash
away
the
blood
and
the
boy
who
was
there
in
his
cloak
of
darkness
struck
the
mole
with
the
egg
the
giant
died
that
minute
the
boy
took
the
young
woman
to
the
castle
of
his
third
sister
next
day
he
went
back
for
the
treasures
of
the
giant
and
there
was
more
gold
in
the
castle
than
one
horse
could
draw
they
spent
nine
days
in
the
castle
of
the
eagle
with
the
third
sister
then
the
boy
gave
back
the
feather
and
the
two
went
on
till
they
came
to
the
castle
of
the
salmon
where
they
spent
nine
more
days
with
the
second

and
he
gave
back
the
fin

came
to
the
castle
of
the
ram
they
spent
fifteen
days
with
the
first

and
had
great
feasting
and
enjoyment
then
the

gave
back
the
lock
of

and
taking
farewell
of
his
sister
and
her

set
out
for

trembling
a
dress
as
white
as

and
green

for

then
the
henwife
put
on
the
cloak
of
darkness
clipped
a
piece
from
the
old
clothes
the
young
woman
had
on
and
asked
for
the
whitest
robes
in
the
world
and
the
most
beautiful
that
could
be
found
and
a
pair
of
green
shoes
that
moment
she
had
the
robe
and
the
shoes
and
she
brought
them
to
trembling
who
put
them
on
when
trembling
was
dressed
and
ready
the
henwife
said

on
your
right
shoulder
and
a
to
put
on
your
left

with
a
golden
saddle
for
you
to
sit
on
and
a
golden
bridle
to
hold
in
your
hand

sat
on
the
golden
saddle
and
when
she
was
ready
to
start
the
henwife
said
you
must
not
go
inside
the
door
of
the
church
and
the
minute
the
people
rise
up
at
the
end
of
mass
do
you
make
off
and
ride
home
as
fast
as
the
mare
will
carry
you
when
trembling
came
to
the
door
of
the
church
there
was
no
one
inside
who
could
get
a
glimpse
of
her
but
was
striving
to
know
who
she
was
and
when
they
saw
her
hurrying
away
at
the
end
of
mass
they
ran
out
to
overtake
her
but
no
use
in
their
running
she
was
away
before
any
man
could
come
near
her
from
the
minute
she
left
the
church
till
she
got
home
she
overtook
the
wind
before
her
and
outstripped
the
wind
behind
she
came
down
at
the
door
went
in
and
found
the
henwife
had
dinner
ready
she
put
off
the
white
robes
and
had
on
her
old
dress
in
a
twinkling
when
the
two
sisters
came
home
the
henwife
asked

any
news
from
the
church

have
great
news

they

a
wonderful
grand
lady

the
the
like
of
the

have
never
seen
on
woman
before
it
little
that
was
thought
of
our
dresses
beside
what
she
had
on
and
there
was
a
man
at
the
church
from
the
king
to
the
beggar
but
was
trying
to
look
at
her
and
know
who
she
was
the
sisters
would
give
no
peace
till
they
had
two
dresses
like
the
robes
of
the
strange
lady
but
and
were
not
to
be
found
next
sunday
the
two
sisters
went
to
church
again
and
left
the
youngest
at
home
to
cook
the
dinner
after
they
had
gone
the
henwife
came
in
and
asked

red
shoes
for
my
feet
what
color
do
you
want
the
mare
to
be
i
want
her
to
be
so
black
and
so
glossy
that
i
can
see
myself
in
her
body
the
henwife
put
on
the
cloak
of
darkness
and
asked
for
the
robes
and
the
mare
that
moment
she
had
them
when
trembling
was
dressed
the
henwife
put
the
on
her
right
shoulder
and
the
on
her
left
the
saddle
on
the
mare
was
silver
and
so
was
the
bridle
when
trembling
sat
in
the
saddle
and
was
going
away
the
henwife
ordered
her
strictly
not
to
go
inside
the
door
of
the
church
but
to
rush
away
as
soon
as
the
people
rose
at
the
end
of
mass
and
hurry
home
on
the
mare
before
any
man
could
stop
her
that
sunday
the
people
were
more
astonished
than
ever
and
gazed
at
her
more
than
the
first
time
and
all
they
were
thinking
of
was
to
know
who
she
was
but
they
had
no
chance
for
the
moment
the
people
rose
at
the
end
of
mass
she
slipped
from
the
church
was
in
the
silver
saddle
and
home
before
a
man
could
stop
her
or
talk
to
her
the
henwife
had
the
dinner
ready
trembling
took
off
her
satin
robe
and
had
on
her
old
clothes
before
her
sisters
got
home
what
news
have
you
asked
the
henwife
of
the
sisters
when
they
came
from
the
church
oh
we
saw
the
grand
strange
lady
again
and
it
little
that
any
man
could
think
of
our
dresses
after
looking
at
the
robes
of
satin
that
she
had
on
and
all
at
church
from
high
to
low
had
their
mouths
open
gazing
at
her
and
no
man
was
looking
at
us
the
two
sisters
gave
neither
rest
nor
peace
till
they
got
dresses
as
nearly
like
the
strange
lady
robes
as
they
could
find
of
course
they
were
not
so
good
for
the
like
of
those
robes
could
not
be
found
in
erin
when
the
third
sunday
came
fair
and
brown
went
to
church
dressed
in
black
satin
they
left
trembling
at
home
to
work
in
the
kitchen
and
told
her
to
be
sure
and
have
dinner
ready
when
they
came
back
after
they
had
gone
and
were
out
of
sight
the
henwife
came
to
the
kitchen
and
said
well
my
dear
are
you
for
church
i
would
go
if
i
had
a
new
dress
to
wear
i
get
you
any
dress
you
ask
for
what
dress
would
you
like
asked
the
henwife
a
dress
red
as
a
rose
from
the
waist
down
and
white
as
snow
from
the
waist
up
a
cape
of
green
on
my
shoulders
and
a
hat
on
my
head
with
a
red
a
white
and
a
green
feather
in
it
and
shoes
for
my
feet
with
the
toes
red
the
middle
white
and
the
backs
and
heels
green
the
henwife
put
on
the
cloak
of
darkness
wished
for
all
these
things
and
had
them
when
trembling
was
dressed
the
henwife
put
the
on
her
right
shoulder
and
the
on
her
left
and
placing
the
hat
on
her
head
clipped
a
few
hairs
from
one
lock
and
a
few
from
another
with
her
scissors
and
that
moment
the
most
beautiful
golden
hair
was
flowing
down
over
the
girl
shoulders
then
the
henwife
asked
what
kind
of
a
mare
she
would
ride
she
said
white
with
blue
and
spots
all
over
her
body
on
her
back
a
saddle
of
gold
and
on
her
head
a
golden
bridle
the
mare
stood
there
before
the
door
and
a
bird
sitting
between
her
ears
which
began
to
sing
as
soon
as
trembling
was
in
the
saddle
and
never
stopped
till
she
came
home
from
the
church
the
fame
of
the
beautiful
strange
lady
had
gone
out
through
the
world
and
all
the
princes
and
great
men
that
were
in
it
came
to
church
that
sunday
each
one
hoping
that
it
was
himself
would
have
her
home
with
him
after
mass
the
son
of
the
king
of
omanya
forgot
all
about
the
eldest
sister
and
remained
outside
the
church
so
as
to
catch
the
strange
lady
before
she
could
hurry
away
the
church
was
more
crowded
than
ever
before
and
there
were
three
times
as
many
outside
there
was
such
a
throng
before
the
church
that
trembling
could
only
come
inside
the
gate
as
soon
as
the
people
were
rising
at
the
end
of
mass
the
lady
slipped
out
through
the
gate
was
in
the
golden
saddle
in
an
instant
and
sweeping
away
ahead
of
the
wind
but
if
she
was
the
prince
of
omanya
was
at
her
side
and
seizing
her
by
the
foot
he
ran
with
the
mare
for
thirty
perches
and
never
let
go
of
the
beautiful
lady
till
the
shoe
was
pulled
from
her
foot
and
he
was
left
behind
with
it
in
his
hand
she
came
home
as
fast
as
the
mare
could
carry
her
and
was
thinking
all
the
time
that
the
henwife
would
kill
her
for
losing
the
shoe
seeing
her
so
vexed
and
so
changed
in
the
face
the
old
woman
asked
what
the
trouble
that
on
you
now
oh
i
lost
one
of
the
shoes
off
my
feet
said
trembling
do
mind
that
do
be
vexed
said
the
henwife
maybe
it
the
best
thing
that
ever
happened
to
you
then
trembling
gave
up
all
the
things
she
had
to
the
henwife
put
on
her
old
clothes
and
went
to
work
in
the
kitchen
when
the
sisters
came
home
the
henwife
asked
have
you
any
news
from
the
church
we
have
indeed
said
they
for
we
saw
the
grandest
sight
the
strange
lady
came
again
in
grander
array
than
before
on
herself
and
the
horse
she
rode
were
the
finest
colors
of
the
world
and
between
the
ears
of
the
horse
was
a
bird
which
never
stopped
singing
from
the
time
she
came
till
she
went
away
the
lady
herself
is
the
most
beautiful
woman
ever
seen
by
man
in
erin
after
trembling
had
disappeared
from
the
church
the
son
of
the
king
of
omanya
said
to
the
other
kings
sons
i
will
have
that
lady
for
my
own
they
all
said
you
did
win
her
just
by
taking
the
shoe
off
her
foot
you
have
to
win
her
by
the
point
of
the
sword
you
have
to
fight
for
her
with
us
before
you
can
call
her
your
own
well
said
the
son
of
the
king
of
omanya
when
i
find
the
lady
that
shoe
will
fit
i
fight
for
her
never
fear
before
i
leave
her
to
any
of
you
then
all
the
kings
sons
were
uneasy
and
anxious
to
know
who
was
she
that
lost
the
shoe
and
they
began
to
travel
all
over
erin
to
know
could
they
find
her
the
prince
of
omanya
and
all
the
others
went
in
a
great
company
together
and
made
the
round
of
erin
they
went
everywhere
north
south
east
and
west
they
visited
every
place
where
a
woman
was
to
be
found
and
left
not
a
house
in
the
kingdom
they
did
not
search
to
know
could
they
find
the
woman
the
shoe
would
fit
not
caring
whether
she
was
rich
or
poor
of
high
or
low
degree
the
prince
of
omanya
always
kept
the
shoe
and
when
the
young
women
saw
it
they
had
great
hopes
for
it
was
of
proper
size
neither
large
nor
small
and
it
would
beat
any
man
to
know
of
what
material
it
was
made
one
thought
it
would
fit
her
if
she
cut
a
little
from
her
great
toe
and
another
with
too
short
a
foot
put
something
in
the
tip
of
her
stocking
but
no
use
they
only
spoiled
their
feet
and
were
curing
them
for
months
afterwards
the
two
sisters
fair
and
brown
heard
that
the
princes
of
the
world
were
looking
all
over
erin
for
the
woman
that
could
wear
the
shoe
and
every
day
they
were
talking
of
trying
it
on
and
one
day
trembling
spoke
up
and
said
maybe
it
my
foot
that
the
shoe
will
fit
oh
the
breaking
of
the
dog
foot
on
you
why
say
so
when
you
were
at
home
every
sunday
they
were
that
way
waiting
and
scolding
the
younger
sister
till
the
princes
were
near
the
place
the
day
they
were
to
come
the
sisters
put
trembling
in
a
closet
and
locked
the
door
on
her
when
the
company
came
to
the
house
the
prince
of
omanya
gave
the
shoe
to
the
sisters
but
though
they
tried
and
tried
it
would
fit
neither
of
them
is
there
any
other
young
woman
in
the
house
asked
the
prince
there
is
said
trembling
speaking
up
in
the
closet
i
here
oh
we
have
her
for
nothing
but
to
put
out
the
ashes
said
the
sisters
but
the
prince
and
the
others
would
leave
the
house
till
they
had
seen
her
so
the
two
sisters
had
to
open
the
door
when
trembling
came
out
the
shoe
was
given
to
her
and
it
fitted
exactly
the
prince
of
omanya
looked
at
her
and
said
you
are
the
woman
the
shoe
fits
and
you
are
the
woman
i
took
the
shoe
from
then
trembling
spoke
up
and
said

you
stay
here
till
i
return
then
she
went
to
the
henwife
house
the
old
woman
put
on
the
cloak
of

everything
for
her

had
the

put
her
on

that
she
was

up
and
said
to
the

eldest
sister

to
be
with
her
and

for
her
one
day
when
trembling

well
and
when
her

was
away
hunting
the
two
sisters
went
out
to

and
when
they

i
in

it
my
wife
that

she
it
my
sister
fair
that
gone
since
the
sisters
were
very
much
alike
the
prince
was
in
doubt
that
night
he
put
his
sword
between
them
and
said
if
you
are
my
wife
this
sword
will
get
warm
if
not
it
will
stay
cold
in
the
morning
when
he
rose
up
the
sword
was
as
cold
as
when
he
put
it
there
it
happened
when
the
two
sisters
were
walking
by
the
seashore
that
a
little
cowboy
was
down
by
the
water
minding
cattle
and
saw
fair
push
trembling
into
the
sea
and
next
day
when
the
tide
came
in
he
saw
the
whale
swim
up
and
throw
her
out
on
the
sand
when
she
was
on
the
sand
she
said
to
the
cowboy
when
you
go
home
in
the
evening
with
the
cows
tell
the
master
that
my
sister
fair
pushed
me
into
the
sea
yesterday
that
a
whale
swallowed
me
and
then
threw
me
out
but
will
come
again
and

out
three
times
i
under
the
enchantment
of
this
whale
and

beach
or

unless

swallowed
the
fourth
time

shall
be
lost
he
must
come
and
shoot
the
whale
with
a
silver
bullet
when
he
turns
on
the
broad
of
his
back
under
the
of
the
whale
is
a
spot
my
husband
must
hit
him
in
that
spot
for
it
is
the
only
place
in
which
he
can
be
killed
when
the
cowboy
got
home
the
eldest
sister
gave
him
a
draught
of
oblivion
and
he
did
not
tell
next
day
he
went
again
to
the
sea
the
whale
came
and
cast
trembling
on
shore
again
she
asked
the
boy

tell
the
master
what
i
told
you
to
tell
him
i
did
not
said
he
i
forgot
how
did

asked
she
the
woman
of
the
house
gave
me
a
drink
that
made
me
forget
well

forget
telling
him
this
night
and
if
she
gives
you
a
drink
do
take
it
from
her
as
soon
as
the
cowboy
came
home
the
eldest
sister
offered
him
a
drink
he
refused
to
take
it
till
he
had
delivered
his
message
and
told
all
to
the
master
the
third
day
the
prince
went
down
with
his
gun
and
a
silver
bullet
in
it
he
was
not
long
down
when
the
whale
came
and
threw
trembling
upon
the
beach
as
the
two
days
before
she
had
no
power
to
speak
to
her
husband
till
he
had
killed
the
whale
then
the
whale
went
out
turned
over
once
on
the
broad
of
his
back
and
showed
the
spot
for
a
moment
only
that
moment
the
prince
fired
he
had
but
the
one
chance
and
a
short
one
at
that
but
he
took
it
and
hit
the
spot
and
the
whale
mad
with
pain
made
the
sea
all
around
red
with
blood
and
died
that
minute
trembling
was
able
to
speak
and
went
home
with
her
husband
who
sent
word
to
her
father
what
the
eldest
sister
had
done
the
father
came
and
told
him
any
death
he
chose
to
give
her
to
give
it
the
prince
told
the
father
he
would
leave
her
life
and
death
with
himself
the
father
had
her
put
out
then
on
the
sea
in
a
barrel
with
provisions
in
it
for
seven
years
in
time
trembling
had
a
second
child
a
daughter
the
prince
and
she
sent
the
cowboy
to
school
and
trained
him
up
as
one
of
their
own
children
and
said
if
the
little
girl
that
is
born
to
us
now
lives
no
other
man
in
the
world
will
get
her
but
him

cowboy
and
the
prince

on
till
they
were
married
the
mother
said
to
her
husband
you
could
not
have
saved
me
from
the
whale
but
for
the
little
cowboy
on
that
account
i
do
grudge
him

daughter
the
son
of
the
king
of
omanya
and
trembling
had
fourteen
children
and
they
lived
happily
till
the
two
died
of
old
age
the
king
of
erin
and
the
queen
of
the
lonesome
island
there
was
a
king
in
erin
long
ago
and
this
king
went
out
hunting
one
day
but
saw
nothing
till
near
sunset
when
what
should
come
across
him
but
a
black
pig
since
i
seen
nothing
all
day
but
this
black
pig
i
be
at
her
now
said
the
king
so
he
put
spurs
to
his
horse
and
raced
after
the
pig
when
the
pig
was
on
a
hill
he
was
in
the
valley
behind
her
when
he
was
on
a
hill
the
pig
was
in
the
valley
before
him
at
last
they
came
to
the
and
the
pig
rushed
out
into
the
deep
water
straight
from
the
shore
the
king
spurred
on
his
horse
and
followed
the
black
pig
through
the
sea
till
his
horse
failed
under
him
and
was
drowned
then
the
king
swam
on
himself
till
he
was
growing
weak
and
said
it
was
for
the
death
of
me
that
the
black
pig
came
in
my
way
but
he
swam
on
some
distance
yet
till
at
last
he
saw
land
the
pig
went
up
on
an
island
the
king
too
went
on
shore
and
said
to
himself
oh
it
is
for
no
good
that
i
came
here
there
is
neither
house
nor
shelter
to
be
seen
but
he
cheered
up
after
a
while
walked
around
and
said
i
a
useless
man
if
i
ca
find
shelter
in
some
place
after
going
on
a
short
space
he
saw
a
great
castle
in
a
valley
before
him
when
he
came
to
the
front
of
the
castle
he
saw
that
it
had
a
low
door
with
a
broad
threshold
all
covered
with
razors
and
a
low
lintel
of
needles
the
path
to
the
castle
was
covered
with
gravel
of
gold
the
king
came
up
and
went
in
with
a
jump
over
the
razors
and
under
the
needles
when
inside
he
saw
a
great
fire
on
a
broad
hearth
and
said
to
himself
i
sit
down
here
dry
my
clothes
and
warm
my
body
at
this
fire
as
he
sat
and
warmed
himself
a
table
came
out
before
him
with
every
sort
of
food
and
drink
without
his
seeing
any
one
bring
it
upon
my
honor
and
power
said
the
king
of
erin
there
is
nothing
bad
in
this
i
eat
and
drink
my
fill
then
he
fell
to
and
ate
and
drank
his
fill
when
he
had
grown
tired
he
looked
behind
him
and
if
he
did
he
saw
a
fine
room
and
in
it
a
bed
covered
with
gold
well
said
he
i
go
back
and
sleep
in
that
bed
a
while
i
so
tired
he
stretched
himself
on
the
bed
and
fell
asleep
in
the
night
he
woke
up
and
felt
the
presence
of
a
woman
in
the
room
he
reached
out
his
hand
towards
her
and
spoke
but
got
no
answer
she
was
silent
when
morning
came
and
he
made
his
way
out
of
the
castle
she
spread
a
beautiful
garden
with
her
druidic
spells
over
the
island
so
great
that
though
he
travelled
through
it
all
day
he
could
not
escape
from
it
at
sunset
he
was
back
at
the
door
of
the
castle
and
in
he
went
over
the
razors
and
under
the
needles
sat
at
the
fire
and
the
table
came
out
before
him
as
on
the
previous
evening
he
ate
drank
and
slept
on
the
bed
and
when
he
woke
in
the
night
there
was
the
woman
in
the
room
but
she
was
silent
and
unseen
as
before
when
he
went
out
on
the
second
morning
the
king
of
erin
saw
a
garden
three
times
more
beautiful
than
the
one
of
the
day
before
he
travelled
all
day
but
could
not
escape
could
not
get
out
of
the
garden
at
sunset
he
was
back
at
the
door
of
the
castle
in
he
went
over
the
razors
and
under
the
needles
ate
drank
and
slept
as
before
in
the
middle
of
the
night
he
woke
up
and
felt
the
presence
of
the
woman
in
the
room
well
said
he
it
is
a
wonderful
thing
for
me
to
pass
three
nights
in
a
room
with
a
woman
and
not
see
her
nor
know
who
she
is

wo
have
that
to
say
again
king
of
erin
answered
a
voice
and
that
moment
the
room
was
filled
with
a
bright
light
and
the
king
looked
upon
the
finest
woman
he
had
ever
seen
well

the
sea
and
its
stern
to
the
land
then
he
raised
the
sails
and
went
his
way
the
music
he
had
was
the
roaring
of
the
wind
with
the
whistling
of
eels
and
he
broke
neither
oar
nor
mast
till
he
landed
under
his
own
castle
in
erin
three
quarters
of
a
year
after

of
the
sun
he
drew
up
his
boat
under
the
king

went
ashore
and
saw
the
whole
land
black
with
the
forces
of
the
king
of
spain
who
was
getting
ready
to
attack
the
king
of

and
said

answered
the
king
of
spain
the
prince
then

to
the
castle
of
the
king
of
erin
and
stayed
there
that
day
as
a
guest

morning
early
he
dressed
himself
in
his
champion
array
and
taking
his
sword
he
went
down
alone
to
the
king
of
spain
and
standing
before
him
bade
him
guard
himself
they
closed
in
conflict
the
king
of

with
all
his

side
and
the

island
on
the
other
they
fought
an
awful
battle
that
day
from
sunrise
till
sunset
they
made
soft
places
hard
and
hard
places
soft
they
made
high
places
low
and
low
places
high
they
brought
water
out
of
the
centre
of
hard
gray
rocks
and
made
dry
rushes
soft
in
the
most
distant
parts
of
erin
till
sunset
and
when
the
sun
went
down
the
king
of

and
his
last
man
were
dead
on
the
field
neither
the
king
of
erin
nor
his
forces
took
part
in
the
battle
they
had
no
need
and
they
had
no
chance
now
the
king
of
erin
had
two
sons
who
were
such
cowards
that
they
hid
themselves
from
fright
during
the
battle
but
their
mother
told
the
king
of
erin
that
her
elder
son
was
the
man
who
had
destroyed
the
king
of
spain
and
all
his
men

and
taking
him
to
an
adjoining
chamber
which
had
a
window
right
over
the
sea
she
seated
him
in
the
open
window
and
gave
him
a
cup
of
drowsiness
to
drink
when
he
had
emptied
the
cup
and
closed
his
eyes
she
pushed
him
out
into
the
darkness
the
prince
of
lonesome
island
swam
on
the
water
for
four
days
and
nights
till
he
came
to
a
rock
in
the
ocean
and
there
he
lived
for
three
months
eating
the
seaweeds
of
the
rock
till
one
foggy
day
a
vessel
came
near
and
the
captain
cried
out
we
shall
be
wrecked
on
this
rock
then
he
said
there
is
some
one
on
the
rock

and

who
it
is
they
landed
and
found
the
prince
his
clothes
all
gone

body
black
from
the
seaweed
which
was
growing
all
over
it
who

the
captain

me
first
to
eat
and
drink
and
then
i
talk
said
he
they
brought
him
food
and
drink
and
when
he
had
eaten
and
drunk
the
prince
said
to
the
captain
what
part
of
the
world
have
you
come
from
i
have
just
sailed
from
lonesome
island
said
the
captain
i
was
obliged
to
sail

side
to

my
ship

the
captain
returned
the
queen
of
lonesome
island
was
standing
on
the
shore
as
the
ship
came
in
oh
my
child
cried
she
why
have
you
been
away
so
long
the
queen
of
erin
threw
me
into
the
sea
after
i
had
kept
the
head
of
the
king
of
erin
on
him
and
saved
her
life
too
well
my
son
that
will
come
up
against
the
queen
of
erin
on
another
day
now
the
prince
lived
on
lonesome
island
three
years
longer
till
one
time
he
came
home
from
hunting
and
found
his
mother
wringing
her
hands
and
shedding
bitter
tears
oh
what
has
happened
asked
he
i
am
weeping
because
the
king
of
spain
has
gone
to
take
vengeance
on
the
king
of
erin
for
the
death
of
his
father
whom
you
killed
well
mother
i
go
to
help
the
king
of
erin
if
you
give
me
leave
since
you
have
said
it
you
shall
go
this
very
night
he
went
to
the
shore
putting
the
prow
of
his
bark
to
the
sea
and
her
stern
to
land
he
raised
high
the
sails
and
heard
no
sound
as
he
went
but
the
pleasant
wind
and
the
whistling
of
eels
till
he
pulled
up
his
boat
next
morning
under
the
castle
of
the
king
of
erin
and
went
on
shore
the
whole
country
was
black
with
the
troops
of
the
king
of
spain
who
was
just
ready
to
attack
when
the
prince
stood
before
him
and
asked
a
truce
till
next
morning
that
you
shall
have
my
champion
answered
the
king
so
there
was
peace
for
that
day
next
morning
at
sunrise
the
prince
faced
the
king
of
spain
and
his
army
and
there
followed
a
struggle
more
terrible
than
that
with
his
father
but
at
sunset
neither
the
king
of
spain
nor
one
of
his
men
was
left
alive
the
two
sons
of
the
king
of
erin
were
frightened
almost
to
death
and
hid
during
the
battle
so
that
no
one
saw
them
or
knew
where
they
were
but
when
the
king
of
spain
and
his
army
were
destroyed
the
queen
said
to
the
king
my
elder
son
has
saved
us
then
she
went
to
bed
and
taking
the
blood
of
a
chicken
in
her
mouth
spat
it
out
saying
this
is
my
heart
blood
and
nothing
can
cure
me
now
but
three
bottles
of
water
from
tubber
tintye
the
flaming
well
when
the
prince
was
told
of
the
sickness
of
the
queen
of
erin
he
came
to
her
and
said
i
go
for
the
water
if
your
two
sons
will
go
with
me
they
shall
go
said
the
queen
and
away
went
the
three
young
men
towards
the
east
in
search
of
the
flaming
well
in
the
morning
they
came
to
a
house
on
the
roadside
and
going
in
they
saw
a
woman
who
had
washed
herself
in
a
golden
basin
which
stood
before
her
she
was
then
wetting
her
head
with
the
water
in
the
basin
and
combing

and
the

thousands
upon
thousands
of
them
of
every

and
size
when

during

beasts
when
the
seven
years

over
they
all
wake
up
and
none
of

sleep
again
for

other
years
if
any
man
could
enter
the
castle
during
the
seven
years
of
sleep
he
could
do
what
he
liked
but
the
island
on
which
the
castle
stands
is
girt
by
a
river
of
fire
and
surrounded
by
a
belt
of
the
aunt

blew
on
a
horn
and
all
the
birds
of
the
air
gathered
around
her
from
every
place
under
the
heavens
and
she
asked
each
in
turn
where
it
dwelt
and
each
told
her
but
none
knew
of
the
flaming
well
till
an
old
eagle
said

the
people
there
asked
the
aunt

the

the

dismissed

birds
and
turning
to
the
prince
said
here

a
bridle
for

to
the
stables

the
bridle
and
put

on
whatever

said
i

said
the
prince
who
took
the
bridle
and
went
out

prince
of
the
lonesome
island
stood
in
front
of
his
aunt
stables
shook
the
bridle
and
out
came
a
dirty
lean
little
shaggy
horse
sit
on
my
back
son
of
the
king
of
erin
and
the
queen
of
lonesome
island
said
the
little
shaggy
horse
this
was
the
first
the
prince
had
heard
of
his
father
he
had
often
wondered
who
he
might
be
but
had
never
heard
who
he
was
before
he
mounted
the
horse
which
said
keep
a
firm
grip
now
for
i
shall
clear
the
river
of
fire
at
a
single
bound
and
pass
the
but
if
you
touch
any
part
of
the
trees
even
with
a
thread
of
the
clothing
that
on
you
you
never
eat
another
bite
and
as
i
rush
by
the
end
of
the
castle
of
tubber
tintye
with
the
speed
of
the
wind
you
must
spring
from
my
back
through
an
open
window
that
is
there
and
if
you
do
get
in
at
the
window
you
done
for
i
wait
for
you
outside
till
you
are
ready
to
go
back
to
erin
the
prince
did
as
the
little
horse
told
him
they
crossed
the
river
of
fire
escaped
the
touch
of
the
and
as
the
horse
shot
past
the
castle
the
prince
sprang
through
the
open
window
and
came
down
safe
and
sound
inside
the
whole
place
enormous
in
extent
was
filled
with
sleeping
giants
and
monsters
of
sea
and
land
great
whales
long
slippery
eels
bears
and
beasts
of
every
form
and
kind
the
prince
passed
through
them
and
over
them
till
he
came
to
a
great
stairway
at
the
head
of
the
stairway
he
went
into
a
chamber
where
he
found
the
most
beautiful
woman
he
had
ever
seen
stretched
on
a
couch
asleep
i
have
nothing
to
say
to
you
thought
he
and
went
on
to
the
next
and
so
he
looked
into
twelve
chambers
in
each
was
a
woman
more
beautiful
than
the
one
before
but
when
he
reached
the
thirteenth
chamber
and
opened
the
door
the
flash
of
gold
took
the
sight
from
his
eyes
he
stood
a
while
till
the
sight
came
back
and
then
entered
in
the
great
bright
chamber
was
a
golden
couch
resting
on
wheels
of
gold
the
wheels
turned
continually
the
couch
went
round
and
round
never
stopping
night
or
day
on
the
couch
lay
the
queen
of
tubber
tintye
and
if
her
twelve
maidens
were
beautiful
they
would
not
be
beautiful
if
seen
near
her
at
the
foot
of
the
couch
was
tubber
tintye
itself
the
well
of
fire
there
was
a
golden
cover
upon
the
well
and
it
went
around
continually
with
the
couch
of
the
queen
upon
my
word
said
the
prince
i
rest
here
a
while
and
he
went
up
on
the
couch
and
never
left
it
for
six
days
and
nights
on
the
seventh
morning
he
said
it
is
time
for
me
now
to
leave
this
place
so
he
came
down
and
filled
the
three
bottles
with
water
from
the
flaming
well
in
the
golden
chamber
was
a
table
of
gold
and
on
the
table
a
leg
of
mutton
with
a
loaf
of
bread
and
if
all
the
men
in
erin
were
to
eat
for
a
twelvemonth
from
the
table
the
mutton
and
the
bread
would
be
in
the
same
form
after
the
eating
as
before
the
prince
sat
down
ate
his
fill
of
the
loaf
and
the
leg
of
mutton
and
left
them
as
he
had
found
them
then
he
rose
up
took
his
three
bottles
put
them
in
his
wallet
and
was
leaving
the
chamber
when
he
said
to
himself
it
would
be
a
shame
to
go
away
without
leaving
something
by
which
the
queen
may
know
who
was
here
while
she
slept
so
he
wrote
a
letter
saying
that
the
son
of
the
king
of
erin
and
the
queen
of
the
lonesome
island
had
spent
six
days
and
nights
in
the
golden
chamber
of
tubber
tintye
had
taken
away
three
bottles
of
water
from
the
flaming
well
and
had
eaten
from
the
table
of
gold
putting
this
letter
under
the
pillow
of
the
queen
he
went
out
stood
in
the
open
window
sprang
on
the
back
of
the
lean
and
shaggy
little
horse
and
passed
the
trees
and
the
river
unharmed
when
they
were
near
his
aunt
house
the
horse
stopped
and
said
put
your
hand
into
my
ear
and
draw
out
of
it
a
druidic
rod
then
cut
me
into
four
quarters
and
strike
each
quarter
with
the
rod
each
one
of
them
will
become
the
son
of
a
king
for
four
princes
were
enchanted
and
turned
into
the
lean
little
shaggy
horse
that
carried
you
to
tubber
tintye
when
you
have
freed
the
four
princes
from
this
form
you
can
free
your
two
aunts
from
the
spell
that
is
on
them
and
take
them
with
you
to
lonesome
island
the
prince
did
as
the
horse
desired
and
straightway
four
princes
stood
before
him
and
thanking
him
for
what
he
had
done
they
departed
at
once
each
to
his
own
kingdom
the
prince
removed
the
spell
from
his
aunts
and
travelling
with
them
and
the
two
sons
of
the
queen
of
erin

they
were
near
the
door
of
their
mother
chamber
the
elder
of
the
two
sons
of
the
queen
of
erin
stepped
up
to
the
prince
of

island
snatched
the
three
bottles
from
the
wallet
that
he
had
at
his
side
and
running
up
to
his
mother

went
on
his
bark
and
sailed
away
with
his
aunts
to

where
he
lived
with

seven
years

and
all
the
giants

and
monsters
that
slept
in
the
great

when
the
queen
opened
her
eyes
she
saw
a
boy
about
six
years
old
playing
by
himself
on
the
floor
he
was
very
beautiful
and
bright
and
he
had
gold
on
his
forehead
and
silver
on
his
poll
when
she
saw
the

she
began
to
cry
and

her
hands
and

here
while

gold
on
his

so
loud
that

iron
spikes

here
in

garden
behind

castle
on

of

spikes

of
kings
sons
who
came
seeking

daughter
in

and
all
of
them
went
away
to
get

knowledge
i
wanted

to
get
it
and
tell
me
what
stopped
the
gruagach
gaire
from

i
took
the
heads
off

all
when
they
came
back
without

tidings
for

they
went
and
i
greatly
in
dread
that

on
the
twelfth
spike
for
i
do
the
same
to
you
that
i
did
to
the
eleven
kings
sons
unless
you
tell
what
put
a
stop
to
the
laughing
of
the
gruagach
the
laughing
gruagach
the
shee
an
gannon
made
no
answer
but
left
the
king
and
pushed
away
to
know
could
he
find
why
the
gruagach
was
silent
he
took
a
glen
at
a
step
a
hill
at
a
leap
and
travelled
all
day
till
evening
then
he
came
to
a
house
the
master
of
the
house
asked
him
what
sort
was
he
and
he
said
a
young
man
looking
for
hire
well
said
the
master
of
the
house
i
was
going
to
look
for
a
man
to
mind
my
cows
if
you
work
for
me
you
have
a
good
place
the
best
food
a
man
could
have
to
eat
in
this
world
and
a
soft
bed
to
lie
on
the
shee
an
gannon
took
service
and
ate
his
supper
then
the
master
of
the
house
said
i
am
the
gruagach
gaire
now
that
you
are
my
man
and
have
eaten
your
supper
you
have
a
bed
of
silk
to
sleep
on
next
morning
after
breakfast
the
gruagach
said
to
the
shee
an
gannon
go
out
now
and
loosen
my
five
golden
cows
and
my
bull
without
horns
and
drive
them
to
pasture
but
when
you
have
them
out
on
the
grass
be
careful
you
do
let
them
go
near
the
land
of
the
giant
the
new
cowboy
drove
the
cattle
to
pasture
and
when
near
the
land
of
the
giant
he
saw
it
was
covered
with
woods
and
surrounded
by
a
high
wall
he
went
up
put
his
back
against
the
wall
and
threw
in
a
great
stretch
of
it
then
he
went
inside
and
threw
out
another
great
stretch
of
the
wall
and
put
the
five
golden
cows
and
the
bull
without
horns
on
the
land
of
the
giant
then
he
climbed
a
tree
ate
the
sweet
apples
himself
and
threw
the
sour
ones
down
to
the
cattle
of
the
gruagach
gaire
soon
a
great
crashing
was
heard
in
the
woods
the
noise
of
young
trees
bending
and
old
trees
breaking
the
cowboy
looked
around
and
saw
a
giant
pushing
through
the
trees
and
soon
he
was
before
him
poor
miserable
creature
said
the
giant
but
were
you
impudent
to
come
to
my
land
and
trouble
me
in
this
way
you
too
big
for
one
bite
and
too
small
for
two
i
do
know
what
to
do
but
tear
you
to
pieces
you
nasty
brute
said
the
cowboy
coming
down
to
him
from
the
tree
is
little
i
care
for
you
and
then
they
went
at
each
other
so
great
was
the
noise
between
them
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
world
but
what
was
looking
on
and
listening
to
the
combat
they
fought
till
late
in
the
afternoon
when
the
giant
was
getting
the
upper
hand
and
then
the
cowboy
thought
that
if
the
giant
should
kill
him
his
father
and
mother
would
never
find
him
or
set
eyes
on
him
again
and
he
would
never
get
the
daughter
of
the
king
of
erin
the
heart
in
his
body
grew
strong
at
this
thought
he
sprang
on
the
giant
and
with
the
first
squeeze
and
thrust
he
put
him
to
his
knees
in
the
hard
ground
with
the
second
thrust
to
his
waist
and
with
the
third
to
his
shoulders
i
have
you
at
last
you
done
for
now
said
the
cowboy
then
he
took
out
his
knife
cut
the
five
heads
off
the
giant
and
when
he
had
them
off
he
cut
out
the
tongues
and
threw
the
heads
over
the
wall
then
he
put
the
tongues
in
his
pocket
and
drove
home
the
cattle
that
evening
the
gruagach
could
find
vessels
enough
in
all
his
place
to
hold
the
milk
of
the
five
golden
cows
after
supper
the
cowboy
would
give
no
talk
to
his
master
but
kept
his
mind
to
himself
and
went
to
the
bed
of
silk
to
sleep
next
morning
after
breakfast
the
cowboy
drove
out
his
cattle
and
going
on
farther
than
the
day
before
stopped
at
a
high
wall
he
put
his
back
to
the
wall
threw
in
a
long
stretch
of
it
then
went
in
and
threw
out
another
long
stretch
of
it
after
that
he
put
the
five
golden
cows
and
the
bull
without
horns
on
the
land
and
going
up
on
a
tree
ate
sweet
apples
himself
and
threw
down
the
sour
ones
to
the
cattle
now
the
son
of
the
king
of
tisean
set
out
from
the
king
of
erin
on
the
same
errand
after
asking
for
his
daughter
and
as
soon
as
the
cowboy
drove
in
his
cattle
on
the
second
day
he
came
along
by
the
land
found
the
five
heads
of
the
giant
thrown
out
by
the
cowboy
the
day
before
and
picking
them
up
ran
off
to
the
king
of
erin
and
put
them
down
before
him
oh
you
have
done
good
work
said
the
king
you
have
won
one
third
of
my
daughter
soon
after
the
cowboy
had
begun
to
eat
sweet
apples
and
the
son
of
the
king
of
tisean
had
run
off
with
the
five
heads
there
came
a
great
noise
of
young
trees
bending
and
old
trees
breaking
and
presently
the
cowboy
saw
a
giant
larger
than
the
one
he
had
killed
the
day
before
you
miserable
little
wretch
cried
the
giant
what
brings
you
here
on
my
land
you
wicked
brute
said
the
cowboy
i
do
care
for
you
and
slipping
down
from
the
tree
he
fell
upon
the
giant
the
fight
was
fiercer
than
his
first
one
but
towards
evening
when
he
was
growing
faint
the
cowboy
remembered
that
if
he
should
fall
neither
his
father
nor
mother
would
see
him
again
and
he
would
never
get
the
daughter
of
the
king
of
erin
this
thought
gave
him
strength
and
jumping
up
he
caught
the
giant
put
him
with
one
thrust
to
his
knees
in
the
hard
earth
with
a
second
to
his
waist
with
a
third
to
his
shoulders
and
then
swept
the
five
heads
off
him
and
threw
them
over
the
wall
after
he
had
cut
out
the
tongues
and
put
them
in
his
pocket
leaving
the
body
of
the
giant
the
cowboy
drove
home
the
cattle
and
the
gruagach
had
still
greater
trouble
in
finding
vessels
for
the
milk
of
the
five
golden
cows
after
supper
the
cowboy
said
not
a
word
but
went
to
sleep
next
morning
he
drove
the
cattle
still
farther
and
came
to
green
woods
and
a
strong
wall
putting
his
back
to
the
wall
he
threw
in
a
great
piece
of
it
and
going
in
threw
out
another
piece
then
he
drove
the
five
golden
cows
and
the
bull
without
horns
to
the
land
inside
ate
sweet
apples
himself
and
threw
down
sour
ones
to
the
cattle
the
son
of
the
king
of
tisean
came
and
carried
off
the
heads
as
on
the
day
before
presently
a
third
giant
came
crashing
through
the
woods
and
a
battle
followed
more
terrible
than
the
other
two
towards
evening
the
giant
was
gaining
the
upper
hand
and
the
cowboy
growing
weak
would
have
been
killed
but
the
thought
of
his
parents
and
the
daughter
of
the
king
of
erin
gave
him
strength
and
he
swept
the
five
heads
off
the
giant
and
threw
them
over
the
wall
after
he
had
put
the
tongues
in
his
pocket
then
the
cowboy
drove
home
his
cattle
and
the
gruagach
did
know
what
to
do
with
the
milk
of
the
five
golden
cows
there
was
so
much
of
it
but
when
the
cowboy
was
on
the
way
home
with
the
cattle
the
son
of
the
king
of
tisean
came
took
the
five
heads
of
the
giant
and
hurried
to
the
king
of
erin
you
have
won
my
daughter
now
said
the
king
of
erin
when
he
saw
the
heads
but
you
not
get
her
unless
you
tell
me
what
stops
the
gruagach
gaire
from
laughing
on
the
fourth
morning
the
cowboy
rose
before
his
master
and
the
first
words
he
said
to
the
gruagach
were
what
keeps
you
from
laughing
you
who
used
to
laugh
so
loud
that
the
whole
world
heard
you
i
sorry
said
the
gruagach
that
the
daughter
of
the
king
of
erin
sent
you
here
if
you
do
tell
me
of
your
own
will
i
make
you
tell
me
said
the
cowboy
and
he
put
a
face
on
himself
that
was
terrible
to
look
at
and
running
through
the
house
like
a
madman
could
find
nothing
that
would
give
pain
enough
to
the
gruagach
but
some
ropes
made
of
untanned
sheepskin
hanging
on
the
wall
he
took
these
down
caught
the
gruagach
fastened
his
two
hands
behind
him
and
tied
his
feet
so
that
his
little
toes
were
whispering
to
his
ears
when
he
was
in
this
state
the
gruagach
said
i
tell
you
what
stopped
my
laughing
if
you
set
me
free
so
the
cowboy
unbound
him
the
two
sat
down
together
and
the
gruagach
said
i
lived
in
this
castle
here
with
my
twelve
sons
we
ate
drank
played
cards
and
enjoyed
ourselves
till
one
day
when
my
sons
and
i
were
playing
a
wizard
hare
came
rushing
in
jumped
on
our
table
defiled
it
and
ran
away
on
another
day
he
came
again
but
if
he
did
we
were
ready
for
him
my
twelve
sons
and
myself
as
soon
as
he
defiled
our
table
and
ran
off
we
made
after
him
and
followed
him
till
nightfall
when
he
went
into
a
glen
we
saw
a
light
before
us
i
ran
on
and
came
to
a
house
with
a
great
apartment
where
there
was
a
man
with
twelve
daughters
and
the
hare
was
tied
to
the
side
of
the
room
near
the
women
there
was
a
large
pot
over
the
fire
in
the
room
and
a
great
stork
boiling
in
the
pot
the
man
of
the
house
said
to
me
are
bundles
of
rushes
at
the
end
of
the
room
go
there
and
sit
down
with
your
men
he
went
into
the
next
room
and
brought
out
two
pikes
one
of
wood
the
other
of
iron
and
asked
me
which
of
the
pikes
would
i
take
i
said
take
the
iron
one
for
i
thought
in
my
heart
that
if
an
attack
should
come
on
me
i
could
defend
myself
better
with
the
iron
than
the
wooden
pike
the
man
of
the
house
gave
me
the
iron
pike
and
the
first
chance
of
taking
what
i
could
out
of
the
pot
on
the
point
of
the
pike
i
got
but
a
small
piece
of
the
stork
and
the
man
of
the
house
took
all
the
rest
on
his
wooden
pike
we
had
to
fast
that
night
and
when
the
man
and
his
twelve
daughters
ate
the
flesh
of
the
stork
they
hurled
the
bare
bones
in
the
faces
of
my
sons
and
myself
we
had
to
stop
all
night
that
way
beaten
on
the
faces
by
the
bones
of
the
stork
next
morning
when
we
were
going
away
the
man
of
the
house
asked
me
to
stay
a
while
and
going
into
the
next
room
he
brought
out
twelve
loops
of
iron
and
one
of
wood
and
said
to
me
the
heads
of
your
twelve
sons
into
the
iron
loops
or
your
own
head
into
the
wooden
one
and
i
said
put
the
twelve
heads
of
my
sons
in
the
iron
loops
and
keep
my
own
out
of
the
wooden
one
he
put
the
iron
loops
on
the
necks
of
my
twelve
sons
and
put
the
wooden
one
on
his
own
neck
then
he
snapped
the
loops
one
after
another
till
he
took
the
heads
off
my
twelve
sons
and
threw
the
heads
and
bodies
out
of
the
house
but
he
did
nothing
to
hurt
his
own
neck
when
he
had
killed
my
sons
he
took
hold
of
me
and
stripped
the
skin
and
flesh
from
the
small
of
my
back
down
and
when
he
had
done
that
he
took
the
skin
of
a
black
sheep
that
had
been
hanging
on
the
wall
for
seven
years
and
clapped
it
on
my
body
in
place
of
my
own
flesh
and
skin
and
the
sheepskin
grew
on
me
and
every
year
since
then
i
shear
myself
and
every
bit
of
wool
i
use
for
the
stockings
that
i
wear
i
clip
off
my
own
back
when
he
had
said
this
the
gruagach
showed
the
cowboy
his
back
covered
with
thick
black
wool
after
what
he
had
seen
and
heard
the
cowboy
said
i
know
now
why
you
do
laugh
and
small
blame
to
you
but
does
that
hare
come
here
still
to
spoil
your
table
he
does
indeed
said
the
gruagach
both
went
to
the
table
to
play
and
they
were
not
long
playing
cards
when
the
hare
ran
in
and
before
they
could
stop
him
he
was
on
the
table
and
had
put
it
in
such
a
state
that
they
could
not
play
on
it
longer
if
they
had
wanted
to
but
the
cowboy
made
after
the
hare
and
the
gruagach
after
the
cowboy
and
they
ran
as
fast
as
ever
their
legs
could
carry
them
till
nightfall
and
when
the
hare
was
entering
the
castle
where
the
twelve
sons
of
the
gruagach
were
killed
the
cowboy
caught
him
by
the
two
hind
legs
and
dashed
out
his
brains
against
the
wall
and
the
skull
of
the
hare
was
knocked
into
the
chief
room
of
the
castle
and
fell
at
the
feet
of
the
master
of
the
place
who
has
dared
to
interfere
with
my
fighting
pet
screamed
he
i
said
the
cowboy
and
if
your
pet
had
had
manners
he
might
be
alive
now
the
cowboy
and
the
gruagach
stood
by
the
fire
a
stork
was
boiling
in
the
pot
as
when
the
gruagach
came
the
first
time
the
master
of
the
house
went
into
the
next
room
and
brought
out
an
iron
and
a
wooden
pike
and
asked
the
cowboy
which
would
he
choose
i
take
the
wooden
one
said
the
cowboy
and
you
may
keep
the
iron
one
for
yourself
so
he
took
the
wooden
one
and
going
to
the
pot
brought
out
on
the
pike
all
the
stork
except
a
small
bite
and
he
and
the
gruagach
fell
to
eating
and
they
were
eating
the
flesh
of
the
stork
all
night
the
cowboy
and
the
gruagach
were
at
home
in
the
place
that
time
in
the
morning
the
master
of
the
house
went
into
the
next
room
took
down
the
twelve
iron
loops
with
a
wooden
one
brought
them
out
and
asked
the
cowboy
which
would
he
take
the
twelve
iron
or
the
one
wooden
loop
what
could
i
do
with
the
twelve
iron
ones
for
myself
or
my
master
take
the
wooden
one
he
put
it
on
and
taking
the
twelve
iron
loops
put
them
on
the
necks
of
the
twelve
daughters
of
the
house
then
snapped
the
twelve
heads
off
them
and
turning
to
their
father
said
i
do
the
same
thing
to
you
unless
you
bring
the
twelve
sons
of
my
master
to
life
and
make
them
as
well
and
strong
as
when
you
took
their
heads
the
master
of
the
house
went
out
and
brought
the
twelve
to
life
again
and
when
the
gruagach
saw
all

alive
and
as
well
as
ever
he
let
a
laugh
out
of
himself
and
all
the

the
laugh
then
the
cowboy
said
to
the
gruagach

said
the
gruagach
and
they
all
made
away
from
the
place
as
fast
as
ever
they
could
the
cowboy
the
gruagach
and
his
twelve
sons
on
the
road
they
came
to
a
woman
who
was

very
hard

the
cowboy

and
they
used
to
play
hurley
with
the
three
sons
of
the
king
of
the
sasenach
and
they
were
more
than
a
match
for
the
king
sons
and
it
was
the
rule
that
the
winning
side
should
give
three
wallops
of
their
hurleys
to
the
other
side
and
my
sons
were
winning
every
game
and
gave
such
a
beating
to
the
sons
that
they
complained
to
their
father
and
the

to
the
gruagach
and
said

pipe
and

he
disappeared

back
from
london
with
the
three
boys
all
safe
and

and
gave
them
to
their

before

gruagach

get
a
taste
of

of
the
pipe

said
the
cowboy
to
the
woman
and
her
sons
to
the
wedding
of
the
daughter
of
the
king
of
erin
they
hurried
on
and
when
within
three
miles
of
the
king
castle
there
was
such
a
throng
of
people
that
no
one
could
go
a
step
ahead
we
must
clear
a
road
through
this
said
the
cowboy
we
must
indeed
said
the
gruagach
and
at
it
they
went
threw
the
people
some
on
one
side
and
some
on
the
other
and
soon
they
had
an
opening
for
themselves
to
the
king
castle
as
they
went
in
the
daughter
of
the
king
of
erin
and
the
son
of
the
king
of
tisean
were
on
their
knees
just
going
to
be
married
the
cowboy
drew
his
hand
on
the
bridegroom
and
gave
a
blow
that
sent
him
spinning
till
he
stopped
under
a
table
at
the
other
side
of
the
room
what
scoundrel
struck
that
blow
asked
the
king
of
erin
it
was
i
said
the
cowboy
what
reason
had
you
to
strike
the
man
who
won
my
daughter
it
was
i
who
won
your
daughter
not
he
and
if
you
do
believe
me
the
gruagach
gaire
is
here
himself
he
tell
you
the
whole
story
from
beginning
to
end
and
show
you
the
tongues
of
the
giants
so
the
gruagach
came
up
and
told
the
king
the
whole
story
how
the
shee
an
gannon
had
become
his
cowboy
had
guarded
the
five
golden
cows
and
the
bull
without
horns
cut
off
the
heads
of
the
giants
killed
the
wizard
hare
and
brought
his
own
twelve
sons
to
life
and
then
said
the
gruagach
he
is
the
only
man
in
the
whole
world
i
have
ever
told
why
i
stopped
laughing
and
the
only
one
who
has
ever
seen
my
fleece
of
wool
when
the
king
of
erin
heard
what
the
gruagach
said
and
saw
the
tongues
of
the
giants
fitted
into
the
heads
he
made
the
shee
an
gannon
kneel
down
by
his
daughter
and
they
were
married
on
the
spot
then
the
son
of
the
king
of
tisean
was
thrown
into
prison
and
the
next
day
they
put
down
a
great
fire
and
the
deceiver
was
burned
to
ashes
the
wedding
lasted
nine
days
and
the
last
day
was
better
than
the
first
the
three
daughters
of
the
king
of
the
east
and
the
son
of
a
king
in
erin
there
was
once
a
king
in
erin
and
he
had
an
only
son
while
this
son
was
a
little
child
his
mother
died
after
a
time
the
king
married
and
had
a
second
son
the
two
boys
grew
up
together
and
as
the
elder
was
far
handsomer
and
better
than
the
younger
the
queen
became
jealous
and
was
for
banishing
him
out
of
her
sight
the
king
castle
stood
near
the
shore
of
loch
erne
and
three
swans
came
every
day
to
be
in
the
water
and
swim
in
the
lake
the
elder
brother
used
to
go
fishing
and
once
when
he
sat
at
the
side
of
the
water
the
three
swans
made
young
women
of
themselves
came
to
where
he
sat
and
talked
to
the
king
son
the
queen
had
a
boy
minding
cows
in
the
place
and
when
he
went
home
that
night
he
told
about
what
he
had
seen
that
there
were
three
young
women
at
the
lake
and
the
king
son
was
talking
to
the
three
that
day
next
morning
the
queen
called
the
cowboy
to
her
and
said
here
is
a
pin
of
slumber
and
do
you
stick
it
in
the
clothes
of
the
king
son
before
the
young
women
come
and
when
they
go
away
take
out
the
pin
and
bring
it
back
to
me
that
day
when
the
cowboy
saw
the
three
young
women
coming
he
went
near
and
threw
the
pin
which
stuck
in
the
clothes
of
the
king
son
that
instant
he
fell
asleep
on
the
ground
when
the
young
women
came
one
of
them
took
a
towel
dipped
it
in
the
cold
water
of
the
lake
and
rubbed
his
face
but
she
could
not
rouse
him
when
their
time
came
to
go
they
were
crying
and
lamenting
because
the
young
man
was
asleep
and
one
of
the
three
put
a
gold
pin
in
his
bosom
so
that
when
he
woke
up
he
would
find
it
and
keep
her
in
mind
after
they
had
gone
a
couple
of
hours
the
cowboy
came
up
took
out
the
and
hurried
off
the
king
son
woke
up
without
delay
and
finding
the
gold
pin
in
his
bosom
he
knew
the
young
woman
had
come
to
see
him
next
day
he
fished
and
waited
again
when
the
cowboy
saw
the
young
women
coming
out
of
the
lake
he
stole
up
a
second
time
and
threw
the
pin
which
stuck
in
his
clothes
and
that
moment
he
was
drowsy
and
fell
asleep
when
the
young
women
came
he
was
lying
on
the
ground
asleep
one
of
them
rubbed
him
with
a
towel
dipped
in
the
water
of
the
lake
but
no
matter
what
she
did
he
slept
on
and
when
they
had
to
go
she
put
a
gold
ring
in
his
bosom
when
the
sisters
were
leaving
the
lake
and
had
put
on
their
and
become
swans
they
all
flew
around
him
and
flapped
their
wings
in
his
face
to
know
could
they
rouse
him
but
there
was
no
use
in
trying
after
they
had
gone
the
cowboy
came
and
took
out
the
when
the
king
son
was
awake
he
put
his
hand
in
his
bosom
found
the
keepsake
and
knew
that
the
sisters
had
come
to
him
when
he
went
fishing
the
third
day
he
called
up
the
cowboy
and
said
i
fall
asleep
every
day
i
know
something
is
done
to
me
now
do
you
tell
me
all
in
time
i
reward
you
well
i
know
my
stepmother
sends
something
by
you
that
takes
my
senses
away
i
would
tell
said
the
cowboy
but
i
in
dread
my
mistress
might
kill
or
banish
me
she
will
not
for
i
put
you
in
the
way
she
not
harm
you
you
see
my
here
now
throw
the
pin
which
i
know
you
have
towards
me
and
hit
the
bag
the
cowboy
did
as
he
was
told
and
threw
the
pin
into
the
where
it
remained
without
harm
to
any
one
the
cowboy
went
back
to
his
cattle
and
the
prince
fished
on
as
before
the
three
swans
were
out
in
the
middle
of
the
lake
swimming
around
for
themselves
in
the
water
and
the
prince
moved
on
fishing
till
he
came
to
a
bend
in
the
shore
on
one
side
of
him
a
tongue
of
land
ran
out
into
the
lake
the
swans
came
to
the
shore
leaving
the
piece
of
land
between
themselves
and
the
prince
then
they
took
off
their
were
young
women
and
bathed
in
the
lake
after
that
they
came
out
put
on
the
dress
of
young
women
and
went
to
where
the
king
son
was
fishing
he
spoke
to
them
and
asked
where
were
they
from
in
what
place
were
they
born
and
why
were
they
swans
they
said
we
are
three
sisters
daughters
of
the
king
of
the
east
and
we
have
two
brothers
our
mother
died
and
our
father
married
again
and
had
two
other
daughters
and
these
two
are
not
so
good
looking
nor
so
well
favored
as
we
and
their
mother
was
in
dread
they
would
get
such
fine
husbands
as
we
so
she
enchanted
us
and
now
we
are
going
about
the
world
from
lake
to
lake
in
the
form
of
swans
then
the
eldest
of
the
three
sisters
said
to
the
king
son
what
kind
are
you
and
where
were
you
born
i
was
born
in
erin
said
he
and
when
i
was
a
little
boy
my
mother
died
my
father
married
again
and
had
a
second
son
and
that
son
to
the
eye
what
i
was
and
my
stepmother
was
for
banishing
me
from
my
father
house
because
she
thought
her
own
son
was
not
so
good
as
i
was
and
i
am
fishing
here
every
day
by
the
lake
to
keep
out
of
her
sight
well
said
the
eldest
sister
i
thought
you
were
a
king
son
and
so
i
came
to
you
in
my
own
form
to
know
could
we
go
on
in
the
world
together
i
do
know
yet
what
to
do
said
the
king
son
well
be
sure
of
your
mind
for
that
will
be
the
last
day
for
me
here
when
the
cowboy
was
going
home
the
king
son
gave
him
the
for
the
stepmother
when
he
had
driven
in
the
cattle
the
cowboy
told
the
queen
that
the
young
man
had
fallen
asleep
as
on
the
two
other
days
but
there
was
an
old
witch
in
the
place
who
was
wandering
about
the
lake
that
day
she
saw
everything
went
to
the
queen
and
told
her
how
the
three
swans
had
made
young
women
of
themselves
and
talked
with
her
stepson
when
the
queen
heard
the
old
witch
she
fell
into
a
terrible
rage
at
the
cowboy
for
telling
her
a
lie
and
banished
him
out
of
her
sight
forever
then
she
got
another
cowboy
and
sent
him
off
with
the
next
day
when
he
came
near
the
lake
the
king
son
tried
to
drive
him
off
but
the
cowboy
threw
the
into
his
clothes
and
he
fell
down
near
the
edge
of
the
water
without
sight
or
sense
the
three
sisters
came
and
found
him
sleeping
they
rubbed
him
and
threw
water
on
his
face
but
they
could
not
wake
him
and
the
three
were
lamenting
sorely
for
they
had
brought
a
swan
skin
with
them
that
day
so
the
king
son
might
make
a
swan
of
himself
and
fly
away
with
them
for
this
was
their
last
day
at
that
place
but
they
could
do
nothing
now
for
he
lay
there
dead
asleep
on
the
ground
before
them
the
eldest
sister
pulled
out
her
handkerchief
and
the
falling
tears
dropped
on
it
then
she
took
a
knife
and
cut
one
of
the
nipples
from
her
breast
the
second
sister
wrote
on
the
handkerchief
keep
this
in
mind
till
you
get
more
account
from
us
they
put
it
in
his
bosom
and
went
away
as
soon
as
the
sisters
had
gone
the
cowboy
came
drew
out
the
pin
and
hurried
away
the
stepmother
was
always
trying
to
banish
the
king
son
hoping
that
something
might
happen
to
him
and
her
own
son
be
the
heir
so
now
he
went
off
and
wandered
away
through
erin
always
inquiring
for
the
eldest
sister
but
never
could
find
her
at
the
end
of
seven
years
he
came
home
and
was
fishing
at
the
side
of
loch
erne
again
when
a
swan
flew
up
to
him
and
said
your
love
is
lying
on
her
unless
you
go
to
save
her
she
is
bleeding
from
the
breast
and
you
must
go
to
her
now
go
straight
to
the
east
the
king
son
went
straight
to
the
east
and
on
the
way
there
rose
up
storm
and
fog
against
him
but
they
did
not
stop
him
he
was
going
on
always
and
when
he
was
three
weeks
journey
from
his
father
castle
he
stumbled
one
dark
misty
day
and
fell
over
a
ditch
when
he
rose
up
there
stood
on
the
other
side
of
the
ditch
before
him
a
little
horse
all
bridled
and
saddled
with
a
whip
on
the
saddle
the
horse
spoke
up
and
said
if
you
are
the
king
son
i
was
sent
here
to
meet
you
and
carry
you
to
the
castle
of
the
king
of
the
east
there
is
a
young
woman
at
the
castle
who
thinks
it
long
till
she
sees
you
now
ask
me
no
questions
for
i
not
at
liberty
to
talk
to
you
till
i
bring
you
to
the
east
i
suppose
we
are
to
be
a
long
time
going
said
the
king
son
do
trouble
yourself
about
the
going
i
take
you
safely
sit
on
my
back
now
and
be
sure
you
a
good
rider
and
you
not
be
long
on
the
road
this
is
my
last
word
they
went
on
and
were
going
always
and
as
he
travelled
the
prince
met
the
wind
that
was
before
him
and
the
wind
that
blew
behind
could
not
come
up
with
him
when
he
was
hungry
the
pommel
of
the
saddle
opened
and
he
found
the
best
of
eating
inside
they
went
on
sweeping
over
the
world
for
two
weeks
and
when
they
were
near
the
east
the
horse
said
get
down
from
my
back
now
for
it
tired
i
am
how
far
are
we
from
the
castle
asked
the
king
son
five
days
journey
answered
the
horse
when
you
come
to
the
castle
do
stop
a
moment
till
you
ask
where
the
young
woman
is
lying
and
tell
them
to
be
sure
to
give
good
stabling
and
food
to
the
horse
come
and
see
me
yourself
every
day
if
you
do
there
will
be
nothing
for
me
but
fasting
and
that
what
i
do
like
when
the
king
son
came
to
the
castle
it
was
evening
the
two
younger
sisters
welcomed
him
these
were
two
of
the
swans
at
the
lake
in
erin
and
now
at
home
by
the
enchantment
of
their
stepmother
they
were
swans
in
the
daytime
and
women
only
at
night
so
as
not
to
be
under
the
eye
of
young
men
when
these
came
to
see
the
stepmother
own
daughters
they
said
our
sister
is
on
an
island
and
we
go
to
her
they
got
a
boat
for
the
young
man
and
went
with
him
to
where
their
sister
was
lying
they
said
to
her
the
son
of
the
king
of
erin
is
here
let
him
come
in
that
i
may
look
at
him
said
she
the
king
son
went
in
and
when
she
saw
him
she
was
glad
have
you
anything
that
belongs
to
me
asked
she
i
have
then
throw
it
on
my
breast
he
threw
the
handkerchief
on
her
breast
and
went
away
next
day
she
rose
from
the
bed
as
well
as
ever
on
the
third
day
after
his
arrival
the
son
of
the
king
of
erin
married
the
eldest
daughter
of
the
king
of
the
east
and
the
stepmother
enchantment
was
destroyed
and
there
was
the
grandest
wedding
that
ever
was
seen
in
that
kingdom
the
king
son
thinking
only
of
his
bride
forgot
all
about
the
horse
that
had
brought
him
over
the
long
road
when
at
last
he
went
to
see
him
the
stable
was
empty
the
horse
had
gone
and
neither
his
father
in
erin
nor
the
stepmother
came
to
his
mind
he
was
living
so
pleasantly
in
the
east
but
after
he
had
been
there
a
long
time
and
a
son
and
a
daughter
had
been
born
to
him
he
remembered
his
father
then
he
made
up
his
mind
not
to
let
the
stepmother
son
be
heir
to
the
kingdom
in
place
of
himself
so
taking
his
wife
and
children
he
left
the
east
and
travelled
to
erin
he
stopped
on
the
road
and
sent
word
to
the
father
that
he
was
coming
when
the
stepmother
heard
the
news
a
great
weakness
came
on
her
she
fell
into
a
fit
and
died
the
king
son
waited
in
a
convenient
place
till
the
funeral
was
over
and
then
he
came
to
the
castle
and
lived
with
his
father
he
was
not
long
in
the
place
when
he
sent
messengers
to
know
could
they
find
the
cowboy
that
the
stepmother
banished
for
telling
about
the
they
brought
the
cowboy
to
the
castle
and
the
king
made
him
his
coachman
the
cowboy
was
not
twelve
months
in
his
new
place
before
he
married
then
the
king
son
gave
him
a
fine
piece
of
land
to
live
on
with
six
cows
and
four
horses
there
was
not
a
happier
man
in
the
kingdom
than
the
cowboy
when
the
father
died
the
king
son
became
king
in
erin
himself
the
fisherman
son
and
the
gruagach
of
tricks
there
was
an
old
fisherman
once
in
erin
who
had
a
wife
and
one
son
the
old
fisherman
used
to
go
about
with
a
and
tackle
to
the
rivers
and
lochs
and
every
place
where
fish
resort
and
he
was
killing
salmon
and
other
fish
to
keep
the
life
in
himself
and
his
wife
and
son
the
son
was
not
so
keen
nor
so
wise
as
another
and
the
father
was
instructing
him
every
day
in
fishing
so
that
if
himself
should
be
taken
from
the
world
the
son
would
be
able
to
support
the
old
mother
and
get
his
own
living
one
day
when
the
father
and
son
were
fishing
in
a
river
near
the
sea
they
looked
out
over
the
water
and
saw
a
small
dark
speck
on
the
waves
it
grew
larger
and
larger
till
they
saw
a
boat
and
when
the
boat
drew
near
they
saw
a
man
sitting
in
the
stern
of
it
there
was
a
nice
beach
near
the
place
where
they
were
fishing
the
man
brought
the
boat
straight
to
the
beach
and
stepping
out
drew
it
up
on
the
sand
they
saw
then
that
the
stranger
was
a
man
of
high
degree
after
he
had
put
the
boat
high
on
the
sand
he
came
to
where
the
two
were
at
work
and
said
old
fisherman

son
of
yours

the
old
fisherman
till

far
as

the
gruagach
you

give
him
to
me
now
and
let
the
mother
alone
they
talked
till
at
last
the
fisherman
promised
to
let
his
son
go
for
the
year
and
a
day
then
the
gruagach
gave
his
word
to
have
the
boy
there
at
the
seashore
that
day
year
the
gruagach
and
the
boy
went
into
the
boat
and
sailed
away
when
the
year
and
a
day
were
over
the
old
fisherman
went
to
the
same
place
where
he
had
parted
with
his
son
and
the
gruagach
and
stood
looking
over
the
sea
thinking
would
he
see
his
son
that
day
at
last
he
saw
a
black
spot
on
the
water
then
a
boat
when
it
was
near
he
saw
two
men
sitting
in
the
stern
of
the
boat
when
it
touched
land
the
two
who
were
in
appearance
jumped
out
and
one
of
them
pulled
the
boat
to
the
top
of
the
strand
then
that
one
followed
by
the
other
came
to
where
the
old
fisherman
was
waiting
and
asked
what
trouble
is
on
you
now
my
good
man
i
had
a
son
that
was
so
keen
nor
so
wise
as

a
stranger
came
like

and
asked

son

him
for
a
year
and
a
day
i
let
the
son

and
the
man
promised

fisherman
well

the
gruagach
the
old
man
looked
again
and
knew
his
son
he
caught
hold
of
him
and
welcomed
him
home
now

the
gruagach

the
gruagach
then
begged
and
craved
till
the
fisherman
promised
to
let
the
son
with
him
for
a
year
and
a
day
again
but
the
old
man
forgot
to
take
his
word
of
the
gruagach
to
bring
back
the
son
at
the
end
of
the
time
and
when
the
gruagach
and
the
boy
were
in
the
boat
and
had
pushed
out
to
sea
the
gruagach
shouted
to
the
old
man

have
given
you
my
word

all
now

and
you
never

the
fisherman
went
home
with
a
heavy
and
sorrowful
heart
and
the
old
woman
scolded
him
all
that
night
till
next
morning
for
letting
her
son
go
with
the
gruagach
a
second
time
then
himself
and
the
old
woman
were
lamenting
a
quarter
of
a
year
and
when
another
quarter
had
passed
he
said
to
her

the
old
man
walking
and
he
used
to
spend
but
one
night
in
a
house
and
not
two
nights
in
any
house
till
his
feet
were
all
in

to
a
hut

after
the
gruagach
had
said
these
words
the
old
man
ate
his
supper
and
went
to
bed
in
the
dead
of
night
the
old
fisherman
son
came
oh
father
said
he
it
would
be
hard
for

to
pick
me
out
among
the
twelve
doves

alone
but
i
tell

and
we

to
pick
up
the
wheat

make
a
ring
around
the
others
walking
for

and
as
i
go
i
give
some
of
them
a
tip
of
my
bill
and
i
lift
my
wings
when
i
striking
them
there
was
a
spot
under
one
of
my
arms
when
i
left

and
you
see
that
spot
under
my
wing
when
i
raise
it
do
miss
the
bird
that
i
be
and
let
your
eyes
off
it
if
you
do
you
lose
me
forever
next
morning
the
old
man
rose
had
his
breakfast
and
kept
thinking
of
what
his
son
had
told
him
at
midday
the
gruagach
took
his
whistle
and
blew
birds
came
to
him
from
every
part
and
among
others
the
twelve
doves
he
took
wheat
from
his
pocket
threw
it
to
the
doves
and
said
to
the
father
now

out
your
son
from
the
twelve
the
old
man
was
watching
and
soon
he
saw
one
of
the
doves
walking
around
the
other
eleven
and
hitting
some
of
them
a
clip
of
its
bill
and
then
it
raised
its
wings
and
the
old
man
saw
the
spot
the
bird
let
its
wings
down
again
and
went
to
eating
with
the
rest
the
father
never
let
his
eyes
off
the
bird
after
a
while
he
said
to
the
gruagach

for
my
son
well
said
the
gruagach
that

him
but
i
blame
your
instructor
for

information
he
gave

curse
so
the
old
fisherman
got
his
son

proper
shape
and
away
they
went

and

the
old
fisherman
took
him
to
the
race

reared
and
snorted
trying
to

the
head
off

man
that
came
near
him

old
man
shouted
for
a
rider

new
horse
caught
up
with
the
others
and
shot
past
them
so
they
had
not
gone
half
way
when
he
was
in
at
the
when
the
race
was
ended
there
was
a
great
noise
over
the
strange
horse
men
crowded
around
the
old
fisherman
from

corner
of
the
field
asking
what
would
he
take
for
the
horse

next
man
to
him
in
a
moment

the
money
in
the
old
man
pocket
then
he

of
the
place
as
fast
as
ever
he
could
it

till
he
was
at

shook
the
bridle
and
the
son
was
there
before

shape
and
features

me
the
son
made
a
hound
of
himself
and
the
old
father
took
him
to
the
when
the
hunt
began
the
hound
was
springing
and
jumping
like
mad
but
the
father
held
him
till
the
others
were
far
out
in
the
field
then
he
let
him
loose
and
away
went
the
son
soon
he
was
up
with
the
pack
then
in
front
of
the
pack
and
never
stopped
till
he
caught
the
game
and
won
the
prize
when
the
hunt
was
over
and
the
dogs
and
game
brought
in
all
the
people
crowded
around
the
old
fisherman
saying
what
do
you
want
of
that
hound
better

him
he
no
good
to
you
they
put
the
old
man
in
a
maze
there
were
so
many
of
them
and
they
pressed
him
so
hard
he
said
at
last
i
sell
the
hound
and
three
hundred
pounds
is
the
price
i
want
for
him
here

for
you
said
a
stranger
putting
the
money
into
his
hand
the
old
man
took
the
money
and
gave
up
the
dog
without
taking
off
the
rope
he
forgot
his
son
warning
that
minute
the
gruagach
na
called
out
i
take
the
worth
of
my
money
out
of
your
son
now
and
away
he
went
with
the
hound
the
old
man
walked
home
alone
that
night
and
it
is
a
heavy
heart
he
had
in
him
when
he
came
to
the
old
woman
without
the
son
and
the
two
were
lamenting
their
lot
till
morning
still
and
all
they
were
better
off
than
the
first
time
they
lost
their
son
as
they
had
plenty
of
everything
and
could
live
at
their
ease
the
gruagach
went
away
home
and
put
the
fisherman
son
in
a
cave
of
concealment
that
he
had
bound
him
hand
and
foot
and
tied
hard
knots
on
his
neck
up
to
the
chin
from
above
there
fell
on
him
drops
of
poison
and
every
drop
that
fell
went
from
the
skin
to
the
flesh
from
the
flesh
to
the
bone
from
the
bone
to
the
marrow
and
he
sat
there
under
the
poison
drops
without
meat
drink
or
rest
in
the
gruagach
house
was
a
and
the
fisherman
son
had
been
kind
to
her
the
time
he
was
in
the
place
before
on
a
day
when
the
gruagach
and
his
eleven
sons
were
out
hunting
the
maid
was
going
with
a
tub
of
dirty
water
to
throw
it
into
the
river
that
ran
by
the
side
of
the
house
she
went
through
the
cave
of
concealment
where
the
fisherman
son
was
bound
and
he
asked
of
her
the
wetting
of
his
mouth
from
the
tub
oh
the
gruagach
would
take
the
life
of
me
said
she
when
he
comes
home
if
i
gave
you
as
much
as
one
drop
well
said
he
when
i
was
in
this
house
before
and
when
i
had
power
in
my
hands
it
good
and
kind
i
was
to
you
and
when
i
get
out
of
this
confinement
i
do
you
a
turn
if
you
give
me
the
wetting
of
my
mouth
now
the
maid
put
the
tub
near
his
lips
oh
i
ca
stoop
to
drink
unless
you
untie
one
knot
from
my
throat
said
he
then
she
put
the
tub
down
stooped
to
him
and
loosed
one
knot
from
his
throat
when
she
loosed
the
one
knot
he
made
an
eel
of
himself
and
dropped
into
the
tub
there
he
began
shaking
the
water
till
he
put
some
of
it
on
the
ground
and
when
he
had
the
place
about
him
wet
he
sprang
from
the
tub
and
slipped
along
out
under
the
door
the
maid
caught
him
but
could
not
hold
him
he
was
so
slippery
he
made
his
way
from
the
door
to
the
river
which
ran
near
the
side
of
the
house
when
the
gruagach
na
came
home
in
the
evening
with
his
eleven
sons
they
went
to
take
a
look
at
the
fisherman
son
but
he
was
not
to
be
seen
then
the
gruagach
called
the
maid
and
taking
his
sword
said
i
take
the
head
off
you
if
you
do
tell
me
this
minute
what
happened
while
i
was
gone
oh
said
the
maid
he
begged
so
hard
for
a
drop
of
dirty
water
to
wet
his
mouth
that
i
had
the
heart
to
refuse
for
is
good
he
was
to
me
and
kind
each
time
he
saw
me
when
he
was
here
in
the
house
before
when
the
water
touched
his
mouth
he
made
an
eel
of
himself
spilled
water
out
of
the
tub
and
slipped
along
over
the
wet
place
to
the
river
outside
i
caught
him
to
bring
him
back
but
i
could
hold
him
in
spite
of
all
i
could
do
he
made
away
the
gruagach
dropped
his
sword
and
went
to
the
water
side
with
his
sons
the
sons
made
eleven
eels
of
themselves
and
the
gruagach
their
father
was
the
twelfth
they
went
around
in
the
water
searching
in
every
place
and
there
was
not
a
stone
in
the
river
that
they
passed
without
looking
under
and
around
it
for
the
old
fisherman
son
and
when
he
knew
that
they
were
after
him
he
made
himself
into
a
salmon
and
when
they
knew
he
was
a
salmon
the
sons
made
eleven
otters
of
themselves
and
the
gruagach
made
himself
the
twelfth
when
the
fisherman
son
found
that
twelve
otters
were
after
him
he
was
weak
with
hunger
and
when
they
had
come
near
he
made
himself
a
whale
but
the
eleven
brothers
and
their
father
made
twelve
cannon
whales
of
themselves
for
they
had
all
gone
out
of
the
river
and
were
in
the
sea
now
when
they
were
coming
near
him
the
fisherman
son
was
weak
from
pursuit
and
hunger
so
he
jumped
up
out
of
the
water
and
made
a
swallow
of
himself
but
the
gruagach
and
his
sons
became
twelve
hawks
and
chased
the
swallow
through
the
air
and
as
they
whirled
round
and
darted
they
pressed
him
hard
till
all
of
them
came
near
the
castle
of
the
king
of
erin
now
the
king
had
made
a
for
his
daughter
and
where
should
she
be
at
this
time
but
sitting
on
the
top
of
the
the
old
fisherman
son
dropped
down
till
he
was
near
her
then
he
fell
into
her
lap
in
the
form
of
a
ring
the
daughter
of
the
king
of
erin
took
up
the
ring
looked
at
it
and
put
it
on
her
finger
the
ring
took
her
fancy
and
she
was
glad
when
the
gruagach
and
his
sons
saw
this
they
let
themselves
down
at
the
king
castle
having
the
form
of
the
finest
men
that
could
be
seen
in
the
kingdom
when
the
king
daughter
had
the
ring
on
her
finger
she
looked
at
it
and
liked
it
then
the
ring
spoke
and
said
my
life
is
in
your
hands
now
do
part
from
the
ring
and
do
let
it
go
to
any
man
and
give
me
a
long
life
the
gruagach
na
and
his
eleven
sons
went
into
the
castle
and
played
on
every
instrument
known
to
man
and
they
showed
every
sport
that
could
be
shown
before
a
king
this
they
did
for
three
days
and
three
nights
when
that
time
was
over
and
they
were
going
away
the
king
spoke
up
and
asked
what
is
the
reward
that
you
would
like
and
what
would
be
pleasing
to
you
from
me
we
want
neither
gold
nor
silver
said
the
gruagach
all
the
reward
we
ask
of
you
is
the
ring
that
i
lost
on
a
time
and
which
is
now
on
your
daughter
finger
if
my
daughter
has
the
ring
that
you
lost
it
shall
be
given
to
you
said
the
king
now
the
ring
spoke
to
the
king
daughter
and
said
do
part
with
me
for
anything
till
you
send
your
trusted
man
for
three
gallons
of
strong
spirits
and
a
gallon
of
wheat
put
the
spirits
and
the
wheat
together
in
an
open
barrel
before
the
fire
when
your
father
says
you
must
give
up
the
ring
do
you
answer
back
that
you
have
never
left
the
that
you
have
nothing
on
your
hand
but
what
is
your
own
and
paid
for
your
father
will
say
then
that
you
must
part
with
me
and
give
me
up
to
the
stranger
when
he
forces
you
in
this
way
and
you
can
keep
me
no
longer
then
throw
me
into
the
fire
and
you
see
great
sport
and
strange
things
the
king
daughter
sent
for
the
spirits
and
the
wheat
had
them
mixed
together
and
put
in
an
open
barrel
before
the
fire
the
king
called
the
daughter
in
and
asked
have
you
the
ring
which
this
stranger
lost
i
have
a
ring
said
she
but
it
my
own
and
i
not
part
with
it
i
not
give
it
to
him
nor
to
any
man
you
must
said
the
king
for
my
word
is
pledged
and
you
must
part
with
the
ring
when
she
heard
this
she
slipped
the
ring
from
her
finger
and
threw
it
into
the
fire
that
moment
the
eleven
brothers
made
eleven
pairs
of
tongs
of
themselves
their
father
the
old
gruagach
was
the
twelfth
pair
the
twelve
jumped
into
the
fire
to
know
in
what
spark
of
it
would
they
find
the
old
fisherman
son
and
they
were
a
long
time
working
and
searching
through
the
fire
when
out
flew
a
spark
and
into
the
barrel
the
twelve
made
themselves
men
turned
over
the
barrel
and
spilled
the
wheat
on
the
floor
then
in
a
twinkling
they
were
twelve
cocks
strutting
around
they
fell
to
and
picked
away
at
the
wheat
to
know
which
one
would
find
the
fisherman
son
soon
one
dropped
on
one
side
and
a
second
on
the
opposite
side
until
all
twelve
were
lying
drunk
from
the
wheat
then
the
old
fisherman
son
made
a
fox
of
himself
and
the
first
cock
he
came
to
was
the
old
gruagach
na
himself
he
took
the
head
off
the
gruagach
with
one
bite
and
the
heads
off
the
eleven
brothers
with
eleven
other
bites
when
the
twelve
were
dead
the
old
fisherman
son
made
himself
the
man
in
erin
and
began
to
give
music
and
sport
to
the
king
and
he
entertained
him
five
times
better
than
had
the
gruagach
and
his
eleven
sons
then
the
king
daughter
fell
in
love
with
him
and
she
set
her
mind
on
him
to
that
degree
that
there
was
no
life
for
her
without
him
when
the
king
saw
the
straits
that
his
daughter
was
in
he
ordered
the
marriage
without
delay
the
wedding
lasted
for
nine
days
and
nine
nights
and
the
ninth
night
was
the
best
of
all
when
the
wedding
was
over
the
king
felt
he
was
losing
his
strength
so
he
took
the
crown
off
his
own
head
and
put
it
on
the
head
of
the
old
fisherman
son
and
made
him
king
of
erin
in
place
of
himself
the
young
couple
were
the
luck
and
we
the
the
presents
we
got
at
the
marriage
were
stockings
of
buttermilk
and
shoes
of
paper
and
these
were
worn
to
the
soles
of
our
feet
when
we
got
home
from
the
wedding
the
thirteenth
son
of
the
king
of
erin
there
was
a
king
in
erin
long
ago
who
had
thirteen
sons
and
as
they
grew
up
he
taught
them
good
learning
and
every
exercise
and
art
befitting
their
rank
one
day
the
king
went
hunting
and
saw
a
swan
swimming
in
a
lake
with
thirteen
little
ones
she
kept
driving
away
the
thirteenth
and
would
not
let
it
come
near
the
others
the
king
wondered
greatly
at
this
and
when
he
came
home
he
summoned
his
sean
dall
glic
old
blind
sage
and
said
i
saw
a
great
wonder
while
out
hunting
a
swan
with
thirteen
cygnets
and
she
driving
away
the
thirteenth
continually
and
keeping
the
twelve
with
her
tell
me
the
cause
and
reason
of
this
why
should
a
mother
hate
her
thirteenth
little
one
and
guard
the
other
twelve
i
will
tell
you
said
the
old
blind
sage
all
creatures
on
earth
whether
beast
or
human
which
have
thirteen
young
should
put
the
thirteenth
away
and
let
it
wander
for
itself
through
the
world
and
find
its
fate
so
that
the
will
of
heaven
may
work
upon
it
and
not
come
down
on
the
others
now
you
have
thirteen
sons
and
you
must
give
the
thirteenth
to
the
diachbha
diachbha
divinity
fate
then
that
is
the
meaning
of
the
swan
on
the
lake
i
must
give
up
my
thirteenth
son
to
the
diachbha
it
is
said
the
old
blind
sage
you
must
give
up
one
of
your
thirteen
sons
but
how
can
i
give
one
of
them
away
when
i
am
so
fond
of
all
and
which
one
shall
it
be
i
tell
you
what
to
do
when
the
thirteen
come
home
shut
the
door
against
the
last
that
comes
now
one
of
the
sons
was
slow
not
so
keen
nor
so
sharp
as
another
but
the
eldest
who
was
called
sean
ruadh
was
the
best
the
hero
of
them
all
and
it
happened
that
night
that
he
came
home
last
and
when
he
came
his
father
shut
the
door
against
him
the
boy
raised
his
hands
and
said
father
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
me
what
do
you
wish
it
is
my
duty
said
the
father
to
give
one
of
my
sons
to
the
diachbha
and
as
you
are
the
thirteenth
you
must
go
well
give
me
my
outfit
for
the
road
the
outfit
was
brought
sean
ruadh
put
it
on
then
the
father
gave
him
a
steed
that
could
overtake
the
wind
before
him
and
outstrip
the
wind
behind
sean
ruadh
mounted
the
steed
and
hurried
away
he
went
on
each
day
without
rest
and
slept
in
the
woods
at
night
one
morning
he
put
on
some
old
clothes
which
he
had
in
a
pack
on
the
saddle
and
leaving
his
horse
in
the
woods
went
aside
to
an
opening
he
was
not
long
there
when
a
king
rode
up
and
stopped
before
him
who
are
you
and
where
are
you
going
asked
the
king
oh
said
sean
ruadh
i
am
astray
i
do
not
know
where
to
go
nor
what
i
am
to
do
if
that
is
how
you
are
i
tell
you
what
to
do
come
with
me
why
should
i
go
with
you
asked
sean
ruadh
well
i
have
a
great
many
cows
and
i
have
no
one
to
go
with
them
no
one
to
mind
them
i
am
in
great
trouble
also
my
daughter
will
die
a
terrible
death
very
soon
how
will
she
die
asked
sean
ruadh
there
is
an
urfeist
a
great
serpent
of
the
sea
a
monster
which
must
get
a
king
daughter
to
devour
every
seven
years
once
in
seven
years
this
thing
comes
up
out
of
the
sea
for
its
meat
the
turn
has
now
come
to
my
daughter
and
we
do
know
what
day
will
the
urfeist
appear
the
whole
castle
and
all
of
us
are
in
mourning
for
my
wretched
child
urfeist
great
serpent
perhaps
some
one
will
come
to
save
her
said
sean
ruadh
oh
there
is
a
whole
army
of
kings
sons
who
have
come
and
they
all
promise
to
save
her
but
i
in
dread
none
of
them
will
meet
the
urfeist
sean
ruadh
agreed
with
the
king
to
serve
for
seven
years
and
went
home
with
him
next
morning
sean
ruadh
drove
out
the
king
cows
to
pasture
now
there
were
three
giants
not
far
from
the
king
place
they
lived
in
three
castles
in
sight
of
each
other
and
every
night
each
of
these
giants
shouted
just
before
going
to
bed
so
loud
was
the
shout
that
each
let
out
of
himself
that
the
people
heard
it
in
all
the
country
around
sean
ruadh
drove
the
cattle
up
to
the
giant
land
pushed
down
the
wall
and
let
them
in
the
grass
was
very
high
three
times
better
than
any
on
the
king
pastures
as
sean
ruadh
sat
watching
the
cattle
a
giant
came
running
towards
him
and
called
out
i
do
know
whether
to
put
a
pinch
of
you
in
my
nose
or
a
bite
of
you
in
my
mouth
bad
luck
to
me
said
sean
ruadh
if
i
came
here
but
to
take
the
life
out
of
you
how
would
you
like
to
fight
on
the
gray
stones
or
with
sharp
swords
asked
the
giant
i
fight
you
said
sean
ruadh
on
the
gray
stones
where
your
great
legs
will
be
going
down
and
mine
standing
high
they
faced
one
another
then
and
began
to
fight
at
the
first
encounter
sean
ruadh
put
the
giant
down
to
his
knees
among
the
hard
gray
stones
at
the
second
he
put
him
to
his
waist
and
at
the
third
to
his
shoulders
come

me
out
of
this
cried
the
giant
and
i
give
you
my
castle
and
all
i
got
i
give
you
my
sword
of
light
that
never
fails
to

a
blow
i
give
you
my
black
horse
that

overtake
the
wind
before
and
outstrip
the
wind
behind
these
are
all
up
there
in
my
castle
sean
ruadh
killed
the
giant
and
went
up
to
the
castle
where
the
housekeeper
said
to
him
oh
it
is
you
that
are
welcome
you
have
killed
the
dirty
giant
that
was
here
come
with
me
now
till
i
show
you
all
the
riches
and
treasures
she
opened
the
door
of
the
giant
and
said
all
these
are
yours
here
are
the
keys
of
the
castle
keep
them
till
i
come
again
and
wake
me
in
the
evening
said
sean
ruadh
lying
down
on
the
giant
bed
he
slept
till
evening
then
the
housekeeper
roused
him
and
he
drove
the
king
cattle
home
the
cows
never
gave
so
much
milk
as
that
night
they
gave
as
much
as
in
a
whole
week
before
sean
ruadh
met
the
king
and
asked
what
news
from
your
daughter
the
great
serpent
did
not
come
said
the
king
but
he
may
come
well
he
may
not
come
till
another
day
said
sean
ruadh
now
the
king
knew
nothing
of
the
strength
of
sean
ruadh
who
was
ragged
and
shabby
the
second
morning
sean
ruadh
put
the
king
cows
in
the
second
land
out
came
the
second
giant
with
the
same
questions
and
threats
as
the
first
and
the
cowboy
spoke
as
on
the
day
before
they
fell
to
fighting
and
when
the
giant
was
to
his
shoulders
in
the
hard
gray
rocks
he
said
i
give
you
my
sword
of
light
and
my
horse
if
you
spare
my
life
where
is
your
sword
of
light
asked
sean
ruadh
it
is
hung
up
over
my
bed
sean
ruadh
ran
to
the
giant
castle
and
took
the
sword
which
screamed
out
when
he
seized
it
but
he
held
it
fast
hurried
back
to
the
giant
and
asked
how
shall
i
try
the
edge
of
this
sword
against
a
stick
was
the
reply
i
see
no
stick
better
than
your
own
head
said
sean
ruadh
and
with
that
he
swept
the
head
off
the
giant
the
cowboy
now
went
back
to
the
castle
and
hung
up
the
sword
blessing
to
you
said
the
housekeeper
you
have
killed
the
giant
come
now
and
i
show
you
his
riches
and
treasures
which
are
yours
forever
sean
ruadh
found
more
treasure
in
this
castle
than
in
the
first
one
when
he
had
seen
all
he
gave
the
keys
to
the
housekeeper
till
he
should
need
them
he
slept
as
on
the
day
before
then
drove
the
cows
home
in
the
evening
the
king
said
i
have
luck
since
you
came
to
me
my
cows
give
three
times
as
much
milk
as
they
did
yesterday
well
said
sean
ruadh
have
you
any
account
of
the
urfeist
he
did
come
said
the
king
but
he
may
come
sean
ruadh
went
out
with
the
king
cows
on
the
third
day
and
drove
them
to
the
third
giant
land
who
came
out
and
fought
a
more
desperate
battle
than
either
of
the
other
two
but
the
cowboy
pushed
him
down
among
the
gray
rocks
to
his
shoulders
and
killed
him
at
the
castle
of
the
third
giant
he
was
received
with
gladness
by
the
housekeeper
who
showed
him
the
treasures
and
gave
him
the
keys
but
he
left
the
keys
with
her
till
he
should
need
them
that
evening
the
cows
had
more
milk
than
ever
before
on
the
fourth
day
sean
ruadh
went
out
with
the
cows
but
stopped
at
the
first
giant
castle
the
housekeeper
at
his
command
brought
out
the
dress
of
the
giant
which
was
all
black
he
put
on
the
giant
apparel
black
as
night
and
girded
on
his
sword
of
light
then
he
mounted
the
steed
which
overtook
the
wind
before
and
outstripped
the
wind
behind
and
rushing
on
between
earth
and
sky
he
never
stopped
till
he
came
to
the
beach
where
he
saw
hundreds
upon
hundreds
of
sons
and
champions
who
were
anxious
to
save
the
king
daughter
but
were
so
frightened
at
the
terrible
urfeist
that
they
would
not
go
near
her
when
he
had
seen
the
princess
and
the
trembling
champions
sean
ruadh
turned
his
black
steed
to
the
castle
presently
the
king
saw
riding
between
earth
and
sky
a
splendid
stranger
who
stopped
before
him
what
is
that
i
see
on
the
shore
asked
the
stranger
is
it
a
fair
or
some
great
meeting
have
you
heard
asked
the
king
that
a
monster
is
coming
to
destroy
my
daughter
no
i
have
heard
anything
answered
the
stranger
who
turned
away
and
disappeared
soon
the
black
horseman
was
before
the
princess
who
was
sitting
alone
on
a
rock
near
the
sea
as
she
looked
at
the
stranger
she
thought
he
was
the
finest
man
on
earth
and
her
heart
was
cheered
have
you
no
one
to
save
you
he
asked
no
one
will
you
let
me
lay
my
head
on
your
lap
till
the
urfeist
comes
then
rouse
me
he
put
his
head
on
her
lap
and
fell
asleep
while
he
slept
the
princess
took
three
hairs
from
his
head
and
hid
them
in
her
bosom
as
soon
as
she
had
hidden
the
hairs
she
saw
the
urfeist
coming
on
the
sea
great
as
an
island
and
throwing
up
water
to
the
sky
as
he
moved
she
roused
the
stranger
who
sprang
up
to
defend
her
the
urfeist
came
upon
shore
and
was
advancing
on
the
princess
with
mouth
open
and
wide
as
a
bridge
when
the
stranger
stood
before
him
and
said
this
woman
is
mine
not
yours
then
drawing
his
sword
of
light
he
swept
off
the
monster
head
with
a
blow
but
the
head
rushed
back
to
its
place
and
grew
on
again
in
a
twinkle
the
urfeist
turned
and
went
back
to
the
sea
but
as
he
went
he
said
i
be
here
again
and
swallow
the
whole
world
before
me
as
i
come
well
answered
the
stranger
maybe
another
will
come
to
meet
you
sean
ruadh
mounted
his
black
steed
and
was
gone
before
the
princess
could
stop
him
sad
was
her
heart
when
she
saw
him
rush
off
between
the
earth
and
sky
more
swiftly
than
any
wind
sean
ruadh
went
to
the
first
giant
castle
and
put
away
his
horse
clothes
and
sword
then
he
slept
on
the
giant
bed
till
evening
when
the
housekeeper
woke
him
and
he
drove
home
the
cows
meeting
the
king
he
asked
well
how
has
your
daughter
fared
oh
the
urfeist
came
out
of
the
sea
to
carry
her
away
but
a
wonderful
black
champion
came
riding
between
earth
and
sky
and
saved
her
who
was
he
oh
there
is
many
a
man
who
says
he
did
it
but
my
daughter
is
saved
yet
for
the
urfeist
said
he
come
well
never
fear
perhaps
another
champion
will
come
next
morning
sean
ruadh
drove
the
king
cows
to
the
land
of
the
second
giant
where
he
left
them
feeding
and
then
went
to
the
castle
where
the
housekeeper
met
him
and
said
you
are
welcome
i
here
before
you
and
all
is
well
let
the
brown
horse
be
brought
let
the
apparel
and
sword
be
ready
for
me
said
sean
ruadh
the
apparel
was
brought
the
beautiful
blue
dress
of
the
second
giant
and
his
sword
of
light
sean
ruadh
put
on
the
apparel
took
the
sword
mounted
the
brown
steed
and
sped
away
between
earth
and
air
three
times
more
swiftly
than
the
day
before
he
rode
first
to
the
seashore
saw
the
king
daughter
sitting
on
the
rock
alone
and
the
princes
and
champions
far
away
trembling
in
dread
of
the
urfeist
then
he
rode
to
the
king
enquired
about
the
crowd
on
the
seashore
and
received
the
same
answer
as
before
but
is
there
no
man
to
save
her
asked
sean
ruadh
oh
there
are
men
enough
said
the
king
who
promise
to
save
her
and
say
they
are
brave
but
there
is
no
man
of
them
who
will
stand
to
his
word
and
face
the
urfeist
when
he
rises
from
the
sea
sean
ruadh
was
away
before
the
king
knew
it
and
rode
to
the
princess
in
his
suit
of
blue
bearing
his
sword
of
light
is
there
no
one
to
save
you
asked
he
no
one
let
me
lay
my
head
on
your
lap
and
when
the
urfeist
comes
rouse
me
he
put
his
head
on
her
lap
and
while
he
slept
she
took
out
the
three
hairs
compared
them
with
his
hair
and
said
to
herself
you
are
the
man
who
was
here
yesterday
when
the
urfeist
appeared
coming
over
the
sea
the
princess
roused
the
stranger
who
sprang
up
and
hurried
to
the
beach
the
monster
moving
at
a
greater
speed
and
raising
more
water
than
on
the
day
before
came
with
open
mouth
to
land
again
sean
ruadh
stood
in
his
way
and
with
one
blow
of
the
giant
sword
made
two
halves
of
the
urfeist
but
the
two
halves
rushed
together
and
were
one
as
before
then
the
urfeist
turned
to
the
sea
again
and
said
as
he
went
all
the
champions
on
earth
wo
save
her
from
me
sean
ruadh
sprang
to
his
steed
and
back
to
the
castle
he
went
leaving
the
princess
in
despair
at
his
going
she
tore
her
hair
and
wept
for
the
loss
of
the
blue
champion
the
one
man
who
had
dared
to
save
her
sean
ruadh
put
on
his
old
clothes
and
drove
home
the
cows
as
usual
the
king
said
a
strange
champion
all
dressed
in
blue
saved
my
daughter
but
she
is
grieving
her
life
away
because
he
is
gone
well
that
is
a
small
matter
since
her
life
is
safe
said
sean
ruadh
there
was
a
feast
for
the
whole
world
that
night
at
the
king
castle
and
gladness
was
on
every
face
that
the
king
daughter
was
safe
again
next
day
sean
ruadh
drove
the
cows
to
the
third
giant
pasture
went
to
the
castle
and
told
the
housekeeper
to
bring
the
giant
sword
and
apparel
and
have
the
red
steed
led
to
the
door
the
third
giant
dress
had
as
many
colors
as
there
are
in
the
sky
and
his
boots
were
of
blue
glass
sean
ruadh
dressed
and
mounted
on
his
red
steed
was
the
most
beautiful
man
in
the
world
when
ready
to
start
the
housekeeper
said
to
him
the
beast
will
be
so
enraged
this
time
that
no
arms
can
stop
him
he
will
rise
from
the
sea
with
three
great
swords
coming
out
of
his
mouth
and
he
could
cut
to
pieces
and
swallow
the
whole
world
if
it
stood
before
him
in
battle
there
is
only
one
way
to
conquer
the
urfeist
and
i
will
show
it
to
you
take
this
brown
apple
put
it
in
your
bosom
and
when
he
comes
rushing
from
the
sea
with
open
mouth
do
you
throw
the
apple
down
his
throat
and
the
great
urfeist
will
melt
away
and
die
on
the
strand
sean
ruadh
went
on
the
red
steed
between
earth
and
sky
with
thrice
the
speed
of
the
day
before
he
saw
the
maiden
sitting
on
the
rock
alone
saw
the
trembling
kings
sons
in
the
distance
watching
to
know
what
would
happen
and
saw
the
king
hoping
for
some
one
to
save
his
daughter
then
he
went
to
the
princess
and
put
his
head
on
her
lap
when
he
had
fallen
asleep
she
took
the
three
hairs
from
her
bosom
and
looking
at
them
said
you
are
the
man
who
saved
me
yesterday
the
urfeist
was
not
long
in
coming
the
princess
roused
sean
ruadh
who
sprang
to
his
feet
and
went
to
the
sea
the
urfeist
came
up
enormous
terrible
to
look
at
with
a
mouth
big
enough
to
swallow
the
world
and
three
sharp
swords
coming
out
of
it
when
he
saw
sean
ruadh
he
sprang
at
him
with
a
roar
but
sean
ruadh
threw
the
apple
into
his
mouth
and
the
beast
fell
helpless
on
the
strand
flattened
out
and
melted
away
to
a
dirty
jelly
on
the
shore
then
sean
ruadh
went
towards
the
princess
and
said
that
urfeist
will
never
trouble
man
or
woman
again
the
princess
ran
and
tried
to
cling
to
him
but
he
was
on
the
red
steed
rushing
away
between
earth
and
sky
before
she
could
stop
him
she
held
however
so
firmly
to
one
of
the
blue
glass
boots
that
sean
ruadh
had
to
leave
it
in
her
hands
when
he
drove
home
the
cows
that
night
the
king
came
out
and
sean
ruadh
asked
what
news
from
the
urfeist
oh
said
the
king
i
had
the
luck
since
you
came
to
me
a
champion
wearing
all
the
colors
of
the
sky
and
riding
a
red
steed
between
earth
and
air
destroyed
the
urfeist
my
daughter
is
safe
forever
but
she
is
ready
to
kill
herself
because
she
has
the
man
that
saved
her
that
night
there
was
a
feast
in
the
king
castle
such
as
no
one
had
ever
seen
before
the
halls
were
filled
with
princes
and
champions
and
each
one
said
i
am
the
man
that
saved
the
princess
the
king
sent
for
the
old
blind
sage
and
asked
what
should
he
do
to
find
the
man
who
saved
his
daughter
the
old
blind
sage
said
send
out
word
to
all
the
world
that
the
man
whose
foot
the
blue
glass
boot
will
fit
is
the
champion
who
killed
the
urfeist
and
you
give
him
your
daughter
in
marriage
the
king
sent
out
word
to
the
world
to
come
to
try
on
the
boot
it
was
too
large
for
some
too
small
for
others
when
all
had
failed
the
old
sage
said
all
have
tried
the
boot
but
the
cowboy
oh
he
is
always
out
with
the
cows
what
use
in
his
trying
said
the
king
no
matter
answered
the
old
blind
sage
let
twenty
men
go
and
bring
down
the
cowboy
the
king
sent
up
twenty
men
who
found
the
cowboy
sleeping
in
the
shadow
of
a
stone
wall
they
began
to
make
a
hay
rope
to
bind
him
but
he
woke
up
and
had
twenty
ropes
ready
before
they
had
one
then
he
jumped
at
them
tied
the
twenty
in
a
bundle
and
fastened
the
bundle
to
the
wall
they
waited
and
waited
at
the
castle
for
the
twenty
men
and
the
cowboy
till
at
last
the
king
sent
twenty
men
more
with
swords
to
know
what
was
the
delay
when
they
came
this
twenty
began
to
make
a
hay
rope
to
tie
the
cowboy
but
he
had
twenty
ropes
made
before
their
one
and
no
matter
how
they
fought
the
cowboy
tied
the
twenty
in
a
bundle
and
the
bundle
to
the
other
twenty
men
when
neither
party
came
back
the
old
blind
sage
said
to
the
king
go
up
now
and
throw
yourself
down
before
the
cowboy
for
he
has
tied
the
forty
men
in
two
bundles
and
the
bundles
to
each
other
the
king
went
and
threw
himself
down

kil

there
was
a
time
long

and
if

then
we
should
be

in
that
time
there
was
a
law
in
the
world
that
if
a
young
man
came
to

a
young
woman
and
her
people
would
give
her
to

the
young
woman
should
get

death
by
the
law
there
was
a
king
in
erin
at
that
time
who
had
a
daughter
and
he
had
a
son
too
who
was
called
kil
arthur

of
the
monarch
of
erin
now
not

from
the
castle
of

there
was
a
tinker
and
one
morning
he
said
to
his

said
he
so
the
tinker
went
to
the
king
castle
they
were
at
dinner
when
he
came
and
the
king
trembled
as
he
saw
him
though
they
were
at
table
the
tinker
went
into
the
room
the
king
asked
what
did
you

for
at
this
time
i

to

that
life
and
strength

leave
me
if

would
to
a
tinker
now
kil
arthur
the
king
son
came
in
caught
the
tinker
and
hanged
him
facing
the
front
of
the
castle
when
he
was
dead
they
made
seven
parts
of
his
body
and
flung
them
into
the
sea
then
the
king
had
a
box
made
so
close
and
tight
that
no
water
could
enter
and
inside
the
box
they
fixed
a
coffin
and
when
they
had
put
a
bed
with
meat
and
drink
into
the
coffin
they
brought
the
daughter
laid
her
on
the
bed
closed
the
box
and
pushed
it
into
the
open
sea
the
box
went
out
with
the
tide
and
moved
on
the
water
for
a
long
time
where
it
was
one
day
it
was
not
the
next
carried
along
by
the
waves
day
and
night
till
at
last
it
came
to
another
land
now
in
the
other
land
was
a
man
who
had
spent
his
time
in
going
to
sea
till
at
length
he
got
very
poor
and
said
i
stay
at
home
now
since
god
has
let
me
live
this
long
i
heard
my
father
say
once
that
if
a
man
would
always
rise
early
and
walk
along
the
strand
he
would
get
his
fortune
from
the
tide
at
last
one
morning
early
as
this
man
was
going
along
the
strand
he
saw
the
box
and
brought
it
up
to
the
shore
where
he
opened
it
and
took
out
the
coffin
when
the
lid
was
off
the
coffin
he
found
a
woman
inside
alive
oh
said
he
i
rather
have
you
there
than
the
full
of
the
box
of
gold
i
think
the
gold
would
be
better
for
you
said
the
woman
he
took
the
stranger
to
his
house
and
gave
her
food
and
drink
then
he
made
a
great
cross
on
the
ground
and
clasping
hands
with
the
woman
jumped
over
the
arms
of
the
cross
going
in
the
same
direction
as
the
sun
this
was
the
form
of
marriage
in
that
land
they
lived
together
pleasantly
she
was
a
fine
woman
worked
well
for
her
husband
and
brought
him
great
wealth
so
that
he
became
richer
than
any
man
and
one
day
when
out
walking
alone
he
said
to
himself
i
am
able
to
give
a
grand
dinner
now
to
ri
fohin
sladaire
mor
king
under
the
wave
the
great
robber
who
owns
men
women
and
every
kind
of
beast
then
he
went
home
and
invited
ri
fohin
to
dinner
he
came
with
all
the
men
women
and
beasts
he
had
and
they
covered
the
country
for
six
miles
the
beasts
were
fed
outside
by
themselves
but
the
people
in
the
house
when
dinner
was
over
he
asked
ri
fohin
have
you
ever
seen
a
house
so
fine
and
rich
or
a
dinner
so
good
as
mine
i
have
not
said
ri
fohin
then
the
man
went
to
each
person
present
each
gave
the
same
answer
and
said
i
have
never
seen
such
a
house
nor
such
a
dinner
he
asked
his
wife
and
she
said
my
praise
is
no
praise
here
but
what
is
this
to
the
house
and
the
feasting
of
my
father
the
king
of
erin
why
did
you
say
that
asked
the
man
and
he
went
a
second
and
a
third
time
to
the
guests
and
to
his
wife
all
had
the
same
answers
for
him
then
he
gave
his
wife
a
flip
of
the
thumb
on
her
ear
in
a
friendly
way
and
said
why
do
you
give
good
luck
to
my
house
why
do
you
give
it
a
bad
name
then
all
the
guests
said
it
is
a
shame
to
strike
your
wife
on
the
night
of
a
feast
now
the
man
was
angry
and
went
out
of
his
house
it
was
growing
dark
but
he
saw
a
champion
coming
on
a
black
steed
between
earth
and
air
and
the
champion
who
was
no
other
than
kil
arthur
his
took
him
up
and
bore
him
away
to
the
castle
of
the
king
of
erin
when
kil
arthur
arrived
they
were
just
sitting
down
to
dinner
in
the
castle
and
the
man
dined
with
his
after

the
king
of
erin
had
cards
brought
and
asked
his
do

i
have

said
the
king
he
shuffled
and
as
they
were
enchanted
cards
and
whoever
held
them
could
never
lose
a
game
he
was
the
best
player
in
the
world
though
he
had
never
played
a
game
before
in
his
life
the
king
said
put
them
in
your
pocket
they
may
do
you
good
then
the
king
gave
him
a
fiddle
and
asked
have
you
ever
played
on
the
like
of
this
indeed
i
have
not
said
the
man
well

it
now
said
the
king
he
played
and
never
in
his
life
had
he
heard
such
music

it
said
the
king
as
long
as
you
do
let
it
from
you
the
first
musician
on
earth
now
i
give
you
something
else
here
is
a
cup
which
will
always
give
you
every
kind
of
drink
you
can
wish
for
and
if
all
the
men
in
the
world
were
to
drink
out
of
it
they
could
never
empty
it
keep
these
three
things
but
never
raise
hand
on
your
wife
again
the
king
of
erin
gave
him
his
blessing
then
kil
arthur
took
him
up
on
the
steed
and
going
between
earth
and
sky
he
was
soon
back
at
his
own
home
now
ri

he
brought

stayed
with

one
day
he
said
to
his
sister

next
morning
he
bade
to
his
sister
and
rode
away
on
his
steed
which
overtook
the
wind
before
and
outstripped
the
wind
behind
he
travelled
swiftly
till
evening
spent
the
night
in
a
forest
and
the
second
day
hurried
on
as
he
had
the
first
the
second
night
he
spent
in
a
forest
and
next
morning
as
he
rose
from
the
ground
he
saw
before
him
a
man
covered
with
blood
from
fighting
and
the
clothes
nearly
torn
from
his
body
what
have
you
been
doing
asked
kil
arthur
i
have
been
playing
cards
all

and
where

you
going
inquired
the
stranger
of
kil
arthur
i

going
around
the
world
to
know

said
the
stranger
and
i
show

man
who

his
match
till
he
went
to
fight
the
main
ocean
kil
arthur
went
with
the
ragged
stranger
till
they
came
to
a
place
from
which
they
saw
a
giant
out
on
the
ocean
beating
the
waves
with
a
club
kil
arthur
went
up
to
the
giant
castle
and
struck
the
pole
of
combat
such
a
blow
that
the
giant
in
the
ocean
heard
it
above
the
noise
of
his
club
as
he
pounded
the
waves
what
do
you
want
asked
the
giant
in
the
ocean
as
he
stopped
from
the
pounding
i
want
you
to
come
in
here
to
land
said
kil
arthur
and
fight
with
a
better
man
than
yourself
the
giant
came
to
land
and
standing
near
his
castle
said
to
kil
arthur
which
would
you
rather
fight
with
gray
stones
or
sharp
weapons
gray
stones
said
kil
arthur
they
went
at
each
other
and
fought
the
most
terrible
battle
that
either
of
them
had
ever
seen
till
that
day
at
last
kil
arthur
pushed
the
giant
to
his
shoulders
through
solid
earth
take
me
out
of
this
cried
the
giant
and
i
give
you
my
sword
of
light
that
never
missed
a
blow
my
druidic
rod
of
most
powerful
enchantment
and
my
healing
draught
which
cures
every
sickness
and
wound
well
said
kil
arthur
i
go
for
your
sword
and
try
it
he
went
to
the
giant
castle
for
the
sword
the
rod
and
the
healing
draught
when
he
returned
the
giant
said
try
the
sword
on
that
tree
out
there
oh
said
kil
arthur
there
is
no
tree
so
good
as
your
own
neck
and
with
that
he
swept
off
the
head
of
the
giant
took
it
and
went
on
his
way
till
he
came
to
a
house
he
went
in
and
put
the
head
on
a
table
but
that
instant
it
disappeared
went
away
of
itself
food
and
drink
of
every
kind
came
on
the
table
when
kil
arthur
had
eaten
and
the
table
was
cleared
by
some
invisible
power
the
giant
head
bounded
on
to
the
table
and
with
it
a
pack
of
cards
perhaps
this
head
wants
to
play
with
me
thought
kil
arthur
and
he
cut
his
own
cards
and
shuffled
them
the
head
took
up
the
cards
and
played
with
its
mouth
as
well
as
any
man
could
with
his
hands
it
won
all
the
time
was
playing
fairly
then
kil
arthur
thought
i
settle
this
and
he
took
the
cards
and
showed
how
the
head
had
taken
five
points
in
the
game
that
did
belong
to
it
then
the
head
sprang
at
him
struck
and
beat
him
till
he
seized
and
hurled
it
into
the
fire
as
soon
as
he
had
the
head
in
the
fire
a
beautiful
woman
stood
before
him
and
said
you
have
killed
nine
of
my
brothers
and
this
was
the
best
of
the
nine
i
have
eight
more
brothers
who
go
out
to
fight
with
four
hundred
men
each
day
and
they
kill
them
all
but
next
morning
the
four
hundred
are
alive
again
and
my
brothers
have
to
do
battle
anew
now
my
mother
and
these
eight
brothers
will
be
here
soon
and
they
go
down
on
their
bended
knees
and
curse
you
who
killed
my
nine
brothers
and
i
afraid
your
blood
will
rise
within
you
when
you
hear
the
curses
and
you
kill
my
eight
remaining
brothers
oh
said
kil
arthur
i
be
deaf
when
the
curses
are
spoken
not
hear
them
then
he
went
to
a
couch
and
lay
down
presently
the
mother
and
eight
brothers
came
and
cursed
kil
arthur
with
all
the
curses
they
knew
he
heard
them
to
the
end
but
gave
no
word
from
himself
next
morning
he
rose
early
girded
on
his
sword
went
forth
to
where
the
eight
brothers
were
going
to
fight
the
four
hundred
and
said
to
the
eight
sit
down
and
i
fight
in
your
place
kil
arthur
faced
the
four
hundred
and
fought
with
them
alone
and
exactly
at
midday
he
had
them
all
dead
now
some
one
said
he
brings
these
to
life
again
i
lie
down
among
them
and
see
who
it
is
soon
he
saw
an
old
hag
coming
with
a
brush
in
her
hand
and
an
open
vessel
hanging
from
her
neck
by
a
string
when
she
came
to
the
four
hundred
she
dipped
the
brush
into
the
vessel
and
sprinkled
the
liquid
which
was
in
it
over
the
bodies
of
the
men
they
rose
up
behind
her
as
she
passed
along
bad
luck
to
you
said
kil
arthur
you
are
the
one
that
keeps
them
alive
then
he
seized
her
putting
one
of
his
feet
on
her
two
ankles
and
grasping
her
by
the
head
and
shoulders
he
twisted
her
body
till
he
put
the
life
out
of
her
when
dying
she
said
i
put
you
under
a
curse
to
keep
on
this
road
till
you
come
to
the
of
the
five
rocks
and
tell
him
you
have
killed
the
hag
of
the
heights
and
all
her
care
he
went
to
the
place
where
the
ram
of
the
five
rocks
lived
and
struck
the
pole
of
combat
before
his
castle
out
came
the
ram
and
they
fought
till
kil
arthur
seized
his
enemy
and
dashed
the
brains
out
of
him
against
the
rocks
then
he
went
to
the
castle
of
the
beautiful
woman
whose
nine
brothers
he
had
killed
and
for
whose
eight
brothers
he
had
slain
the
four
hundred
when
he
appeared
the
mother
rejoiced
the
eight
brothers
blessed
him
and
gave
him
their
sister
in
marriage
and
kil
arthur
took
the
beautiful
woman
to
his
father
castle
in
erin
where
they
both
lived
happily
and
well
there
was
once
a
king
of
a
province
in
erin
who
had
an
only
son
the
king
was
very
careful
of
this
son
and
sent
him
to
school
for
good
instruction
the
other
three
kings
of
provinces
in
erin
had
three
sons
at
the
same
school
and
the
three
sent
word
by
this
one
to
his
father
that
if
he
did
put
his
son
to
death
they
would
put
both
father
and
son
to
death
themselves
when
the
young
man
came
home
with
this
word
to
his
father
and
mother
they
were
grieved
when
they
heard
it
but
the
king
son
said
that
he
would
go
out
into
the
world
to
seek
his
fortune
and
settle
the
trouble
in
that
way
so
away
he
went
taking
with
him
only
five
pounds
in
money
for
his
support
the
young
man
travelled
on
till
he
came
to
a
where
he
saw
four
men
fighting
over
a
coffin
then
he
went
up
to
the
four
and
saw
that
two
of
them
were
trying
to
put
the
coffin
down
into
a
grave
and
the
other
two
preventing
them
and
keeping
the
coffin
above
ground
when
the
king
son
came
near
the
men
he
asked
why
do
you
fight
in
such
a
place
as
this
and
why
do
you
keep
the
coffin
above
ground
two
of
the
men
answered
and
said
the
body
of
our
brother
is
in
this
coffin
and
these
two
men
wo
let
us
bury
it
the
other
two
then
said
we
have
a
debt
of
five
pounds
on
the
dead
man
and
we
wo
let
his
body
be
buried
till
the
debt
is
paid
the
son
said
do
you
let
these
men
bury
their
brother
and
i
will
pay
what
you
ask
then
the
two
let
the
brothers
of
the
dead
man
bury
him
the
king
son
paid
the
five
pounds
and
went
away
and
except
the
clothes
on
his
back
he
had
no
more
than
on
the
day
he
was
born
after
he
had
gone
on
his
way
awhile
and
the
was
out
of
sight
he
turned
and
saw
a
sprightly
man
hurrying
after
him
when
he
came
up
the
stranger
asked

want
a
serving
man

the
king
son

asked
the
king
son
answered
the
red
man
when
they
had
gone
on
a
piece
of
the
way
together
the
king
son
stopped
and
asked
where

be

in
a
giant
castle
where
there
will
be

welcome
for

said
when

they
found
themselves
in
front
of
a
castle
in
they
went
and
saw
no
one
inside
only
a
tall
old
hag
but
they
were
not
long
in
the
place
till
they
heard
a
loud
rushing
noise
outside
and
a
blow
on
the
castle
the
giant
came
and
the
first
words
he
let
out
of
his
mouth
were
i
glad
to

nobody
to

you
from

but

said
when
the
giant
heard
these
words
he
changed
his
treatment
entirely
he
gave
the
king
son
and
a
hearty
welcome
and
a
kindly
greeting
when
he
understood
the
news
they
brought
he
washed
them
with
the
tears
of
his
eyes
dried
them
with
kisses
and
gave
them
a
good
supper
and
a
soft
bed
that
night
next
morning
the
giant
was
up
at
an
early
hour
and
he
went
to
the
bedside
of
each
man
and
told
him
to
rise
and
have
breakfast
asked
his
reward
of
the
giant
for
telling
him
of
the
champions
of
erin
and
the

asked
the
giant
the
light
black
steed
in
your
stable
that
a
gift

said
the
giant
for
when
any
one
comes
to
trouble
or
attack
me
all
i
have
to
do
is
to
throw
my
leg
over

steed
and
away
he
carries
me
out
of

of
every

that
steed
i
bring
all
the
kingdom
of
erin
against

the
giant
stopped
a
moment
and
said
i
believe

that
thing
so

may
take
the
steed
then
took
the
steed
of
the
giant

him
to
the
king

the
second
giant
was
going
to

the
king
son
for
supper
but
when

him
about
the
forces
of
erin
he
changed
his
manner
and
entertained

said
you

give
me
a
present
for

services
in

the
giant

but
you
have
a
gift
which
suits

asked
the
giant
the
black
sword
that
never
fails
a
blow

that
gift
from

said
the
giant
and
i
ca
spare
it
for
if
a
whole
army
were
to
come
against
me
as
soon
as
i
have
my
two
hands
on
the
hilt
of
that
sword
i
let
no
man
near
me
without
sweeping
the
head
off
him
well
said
i

time
but

the
whole
kingdom
of
erin
against

the
giant
stopped
a
moment
and
said
i
believe
you
do
that
if
it
served
you
so
he
took
the
sword
off
his
belt
and
handed
it
to
his
guest
gave
it
to
the
king
son
who
mounted
his
steed
and
they
both
went
away
when
they
had
gone
some
distance
from
the
giant
castle
said
to
the
king
son
where
shall

we

night
lodging
of
him
and
a
good
gift
in
the
morning
soon
after

they
came
to
the
castle
where
they
met
the
worst
reception
and
the
harshest
they
had
found
on
the
road
the
giant
was
going
to
eat
them
both
for
supper
but
when
told
him
of
the
champions
of
erin
he
became
as
kind
as
his
two
brothers
and
gave
good
entertainment
to
both
next
morning
after
breakfast
asked
for
a
present
in

for
his
services
do

see
the
pot
of
gold

the
corner
there
under
my
bed

the
giant
it

but
the
cloak
of
darkness
oh
said
the
giant
you

that
cloak
of
me
for
i
want
it
myself
if
any
man
were
to
come
against
me
all
i
have
to
do
would
be
to
put
that
cloak
on
my
shoulders
and
no
one
in
the
world
could
see
me
or
know
where
i
be
well

it
long
enough
that

all
the
kingdom
of

and
still
more
forces
to
destroy
you
and
it
not
long

last
after

the
giant
thought
a
moment
and
then
said
i
believe
you
do
what
you
say
there
the
black
cloak
hanging
on
the
wall
before
you
take
it
took
the
cloak
and
the
two
went
away
together
the
son
riding
on
the
light
black
steed
and
having
the
sword
at
his
back
when
out
of
sight
of
the
giant
put
on
the
cloak
and
was
to
be
seen
and
no
other
man
could
have
been
seen
in
his
place
then
the
king
son
looked
around
and
began
to
call
and
search
for
his
man
he
was
lonely
without
him
and
grieved
not
to
see
him
glad
to
see
the
affection
of
the
king
son
took
off
the
cloak
and
was
at
his
side
again
where
are
we
going
now
asked
the
king
son

a
long
journey
to

travelled
on
till

behind
the
gold
then
said

you
and
ask
his
daughter
of
the
king
and
i
stay
here
outside
with
the
cloak
on
me
so
he
went
in
and
spoke
to
the
king
and
the
answer
he
got
was
this
i

to
give
you

daughter
and
in

garden
behind

castle

three
hundred
iron
spikes
and
every
spike
of
them
but
one
is
covered
with
the
head
of
a
king
son
who
could
do
what
my
daughter
wanted
of
him
and
i
greatly
in
dread
that

the
princess
gave
him
a
thimble
and
said
have
this
for
me
in
the
morning
he
put
the
thimble
on
his
finger
and
she
thought
it
could
be
easily
taken
away
if
he
would
sleep
so
she
came
to
him
in
the
night
with
a
drink
and
said
i
give
you
this
in
hopes
i
gain
more
drink
by
you
he
swallowed
the
liquor
and
the
princess
went
away
with
the
empty
cup
then
the
king
son
put
the
thimble
in
his
mouth
between
his
cheek
and
his
teeth
for
safe
keeping
and
was
soon
asleep
when
the
princess
came
to
her
own
chamber
she
struck
her
maid
with
a
an
a
rod
of
enchantment
and
turned
her
into
a
rat
then
she
made
such
music
of
fifes
and
trumpets
to
sound
throughout
the
castle
that
every
soul
in
it
fell
asleep
that
minute
she
sent
the
rat
to
where
the
king
son
was
sleeping
and
the
rat
put
her
tail
into
the
nostrils
of
the
young
man
tickled
his
nose
so
that
he
sneezed
and
blew
the
thimble
out
of
his
mouth
the
rat
caught
it
and
ran
away
to
the
princess
who
struck
her
with
the
rod
of
enchantment
and
turned
her
into
a
maid
again
then
the
princess
and
the
maid
set
out
for
the
eastern
world
taking
the
thimble
with
them
who
was
watching

with
her
finger

in

house
a
giant
the
princess
greeted
him
and
gave
him
the
thimble

ground
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
when
she
had
finished
conversation
with
the
giant
the
princess
kissed
him
and
hurried
away

till
they
came

when
he
gave
up
the
thimble
the
king
said
you
have
won
one
third
of
my
daughter
but
the
princess
was
bitterly
angry
and
vexed
to
the
heart
that
any
man
on
earth
should
know
that
she
had
dealings
with
the
giant
she
cared
more
for
that
than
anything
else
when
the
second
day
had
passed
and
the
king
son
was
going
to
bed
the
princess
gave
him
a
comb
to
keep

with
a
draught

to
her
own
chamber
she
struck
the
maid
with
her
rod
of
enchantment
and
made
a
great
yellow
cat
of
her
then
she
caused
such
music
of
fifes
and
trumpets
to
sound
throughout
the
castle
that
every
soul
was
in
a
deep
sleep
before
the
music
was
over
and
that
moment
she
sent
the
cat
to
the
chamber
of
the
king

the
cat

the
handkerchief

into

in
this
way
when
the
giant
heard
this
he
was
raging
and
threw
the
comb
into
the
sea
behind
him
then
with
druidic
spells
he
raised
thunder
and
lightning
and
wind
the
sea
was
roaring
with
storm
and
rain
but
the
comb
had
not
touched
the
water

the
garden
of
king
behind
the
gold
for
all
men
think
the
same
will
happen
to
you
that
has
happened
to
every
king
son
before
you
go
up
on
your
steed
and
ride
to
the
where
the
king
and
his
daughter
are
sitting
and
give
her
the
comb
the
king
son
did
as
bade
him
when
he
saw
the
comb
the
king
said
now
you
have
my
daughter
won
but
her
face
went
from
the
princess
entirely
she
was
so
vexed
that
any
man
should
know
of
her
dealings
with
the
giant
the
third
night
when
he
was
going
to
bed
the
princess
said
to
the
son
if
you
will
not
have
at
my
father
castle
morning
the
head
i
will
kiss
you
die
and
your
own
head
will
be
put
on
the
last
spike
in
my
father
garden
later
in
the
night
she
came
to
the
bedside
of
the
king
son
with
a
draught
which
he
drank
and
before
she
was
back
in
her
chamber
he
slept
then
she
made
such
music
all
over
the
castle
that
not
a
soul
was
awake
when
the
music
had
ceased
that
moment
she
hurried
away
with
her
maid
to
the
eastern
world
but
followed
her
in
his
cloak
of
darkness
this
time
he
carried
with
him
the
sword
that
never
failed
a
blow
when
she
came
to
the
rock
in
the
eastern
world
and
entered
the
house
of
the
giant
the
princess
said
you
let
my
two
gifts
go
with
the
son
of
the
king
in
erin
and
he
have
me
won
if
he
have
your
head
at
my
father
castle
in
the
morning
never
fear
said
the
giant
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
to
take
the
head
off
me
but
the
sword
of
darkness
that
never
fails
a
blow
and
that
sword
belongs
to
my
brother
in
the
western
world
the
princess
gave
the
giant
a
kiss
at
parting
and
as
she
hurried
away
with
her
maid
the
giant
turned
to
look
at
her
his
head
was
covered
with
an
iron
cap
but
as
he
looked
he
laid
bare
a
thin
strip
of
his
neck
was
there
near
him
and
said
in
his
mind
your
sword
has
never
been
so
close
to
your
neck
before
and
with
one
blow
he
swept
the
head
off
him
then
began
the
greatest
struggle
that
ever
had
to
keep
the
head
from
the
body
of
the
giant
the
head
fought
to
put
itself
on
again
and
never
stopped
till
the
body
was
dead
then
it
fell
to
the
ground
seized
but
could
stir
the
head
could
move
it
from
its
place
then
he
searched
all
around
it
and
found
a
an
pin
of
slumber
near
the
ear
when
he
took
the
pin
away
he
had
no
trouble
in
carrying
the
head
and
he
made
no
delay
but
came
to
the
castle
at
daybreak
and
threw
the
head
to
a
herd
of
pigs
that
belonged
to
the
king
then
he
went
to
the
king
son
and
asked
what
happened
to
you
last
night
the
princess
came
to
me
and
said
that
if
i
would
bring
to
her
father
castle
this
morning
the
head
she
was
to
kiss
last
night
my
own
head
would
be
on
the
last
spike
come
out
with
me
now
to
the
pigs
said
the
two
went
out
and
said
go
in
among
the
pigs
and
take
the
head
with
you
to
the
king
and
a
strange
head
it
is
to
put
before
a
king
so
the
king
son
went
on
his
steed
to
the
and
gave
the
head
to
the
king
and
his
daughter
and
turning
to
the
princess
said
this
is
the
head
you
kissed
last
night
and
it
not
a
nice
looking
head
either
you
have
my
daughter
won
now
entirely
said
the
king
and
she
is
yours
and
do
you
take
that
head
to
the
great
dark
hole
that
is
out
there
on
one
side
of
my
castle
grounds
and
throw
it
down
the
king
son
mounted
his
steed
and
rode
off
with
the
head
till
he
came
to
the
hole
going
deep
into
the
earth
when
he
let
down
the
head
it
went
to
the
bottom
with
such
a
roaring
and
such
a
noise
that
every
mare
and
cow
and
every
beast
in
the
whole
kingdom
cast
its
young
such
was
the
terror
that
was
caused
by
the
noise
of
the
head
in
going
to
the
bottom
of
the
hole
when
the
head
was
put
away
the
king
son
went
back
to
the
castle
and
married
the
daughter
of
king
behind
the
gold
the
wedding
lasted
nine
days
and
nights
and
the
last
night
was
better
than
the
first
when
the
wedding
was
over
went
to
the
king
and
said
you
have
provided
no
fortune
for
your
daughter
and
it
is
but
right
that
you
should
remember
her
i
have
plenty
of
gold
and
silver
to
give
her
said
the
king
it
is
gold
and
silver
that
your
wants
but
men
to
stand
against
his
enemies
when
they
come
on
him
i
have
more
treasures
than
men
said
king
behind
the
gold
but
i
wo
see
my
daughter
conquered
for
want
of
an
army
they
were
satisfied
with
the
king
word
and
next
day
took
the
road
to
erin
and
kept
on
their
way
till
they
came
opposite
the
then
said
to
the
king
son
you

good
you
have
never
told
me
a
story
since
the
first
day
i
saw

story
to
tell
you
except

met

me
what

before

was
passing
this
place
before

saw

said
the
king
son
and
four
men
were
fighting
over
a
coffin
i
spoke
to
them
and
two
of
them
said
they
were
burying
the
body
of
their
brother
which
was
in
the
coffin
and
the
others
said
the
dead
man
owed
them
five
pounds
and
they
would
let
the
coffin
into
the
ground
until
they
got
the
money
i
paid
five
pounds
and
the
body
was
buried
it
was
my
body

in
the
coffin
said
and
i
came
back
into
this
world
to
do
you
a
good
turn
and
now
i
am
going
and
never
see
me
again
unless
trouble
is
on
you
disappeared
and
the
king
son
went
home
he
was
with
his
father
long
till
the
other
three
kings
sons
heard
he
had
come
back
to
erin
with
the
daughter
of
king
behind
the
gold
they
sent
word
saying
we
take
the
head
off
you
now
and
put
an
end
to
your
father
and
yourself
the
king
son
went
out
to
walk
alone
and
as
he
was
lamenting
the
fate
he
had
brought
on
his
father
who
should
come
along
to
meet
him
but
what
trouble
is
on
you
now
asked
he
oh
three
kings
sons
are
coming
with
their
fleets
and
armies
to
destroy
my
father
and
myself
and
what
can
we
do
with
our
one
fleet
and
one
army
well
said
i
settle
that
for
you
without
delay
then
he
sent
a
message
straight
to
king
behind
the
gold
who
gave
a
fleet
and
an
army
and
they
came
to
erin
so
quickly
that
they
were
at
the
castle
before
the
forces
of
the
three
kings
sons
and
when
the
three
came
the
battle
began
on
sea
and
land
at
both
sides
of
the
castle
the
three
fleets
of
the
three
kings
sons
were
sunk
their
armies
destroyed
and
the
three
heads
taken
off
themselves
when
the
battle
was
over
and
the
country
safe
the
king
resigned
the
castle
and
power
to
his
son
and
the
son
of
a
king
in
a
province
became
king
over
all
the
land
of
erin
birth
of
fin
maccumhail
cumhail
genitive
of
cumhal
after
mac
son
pronounced
cool
cumhal
macart
was
a
great
champion
in
the
west
of
erin
and
it
was
prophesied
of
him
that
if
ever
he
married
he
would
meet
death
in
the
next
battle
he
fought
for
this
reason
he
had
no
wife
and
knew
no
woman
for
a
long
time
till
one
day
he
saw
the
king
daughter
who
was
so
beautiful
that
he
forgot
all
fear
and
married
her
in
secret
next
day
after
the
marriage
news
came
that
a
battle
had
to
be
fought
now
a
druid
had
told
the
king
that
his
daughter
son
would
take
the
kingdom
from
him
so
he
made
up
his
mind
to
look
after
the
daughter
and
not
let
any
man
come
near
her
before
he
went
to
the
battle
cumhal
told
his
mother
everything
told
her
of
his
relations
with
the
king
daughter
he
said
i
shall
be
killed
in
battle
according
to
the
prophecy
of
the
druid
and
i
afraid
if
his
daughter
has
a
son
the
king
will
kill
the
child
for
the
prophecy
is
that
he
will
lose
the
kingdom
by
the
son
of
his
own
daughter
now
if
the
king
daughter
has
a
son
do
you
hide
and
rear
him
if
you
can
you
will
be
his
only
hope
and
stay
cumhal
was
killed
in
the
battle
and
within
that
year
the
daughter
had
a
son
by
command
of
his
grandfather
the
boy
was
thrown
out
of
the
castle
window
into
a
loch
to
be
drowned
on
the
day
of
his
birth
the
boy
sank
from
sight
but
after
remaining
a
while
under
the
water
he
rose
again
to
the
surface
and
came
to
land
holding
a
live
salmon
in
his
hand
the
grandmother
of
the
boy
cumhal
mother
stood
watching
on
the
shore
and
said
to
herself
as
she
saw
this
he
is
my
grandson
the
true
son
of
my
own
child
and
seizing
the
boy
she
rushed
away
with
him
and
vanished
before
the
king
people
could
stop
her
when
the
king
heard
that
the
old
woman
had
escaped
with
his
son
he
fell
into
a
terrible
rage
and
ordered
all
the
male
children
born
that
day
in
the
kingdom
to
be
put
to
death
hoping
in
this
way
to
kill
his
own
grandson
and
save
the
crown
for
himself
after
she
had
disappeared
from
the
bank
of
the
loch
the
old
woman
cumhal
mother
made
her
way
to
a
thick
forest
where
she
spent
that
night
as
best
she
could
next
day
she
came
to
a
great
oak
tree
then
she
hired
a
man
to
cut
out
a
chamber
in
the
tree
when
all
was
finished
and
there
was
a
nice
room
in
the
oak
for
herself
and
her
grandson
and
a
whelp
of
the
same
age
as
the
boy
and
which
she
had
brought
with
her
from
the
castle
she
said
to
the
man
give
me
the
axe
which
you
have
in
your
hand
there
is
something
here
that
i
want
to
fix
the
man
gave
the
axe
into
her
hand
and
that
minute
she
swept
the
head
off
him
saying
you
never
tell
any
man
about
this
place
now
one
day
the
whelp
ate
some
of
the
fine
chippings
left
cut
by
the
carpenter
from
the
inside
of
the
tree
the
old
woman
said
you
be
called
bran
from
this
out
all
three
lived
in
the
tree
together
and
the
old
woman
did
not
take
her
grandson
out
till
the
end
of
five
years
and
then
he
could
walk
he
had
been
sitting
so
long
inside
when
the
old
grandmother
had
taught
the
boy
to
walk
she
brought
him
one
day
to
the
brow
of
a
hill
from
which
there
was
a
long
slope
she
took
a
switch
and
said
now
run
down
this
place
i
will
follow
and
strike
you
with
this
switch
and
coming
up
i
will
run
ahead
and
you
strike
me
as
often
as
you
can
the
first
time
they
ran
down
his
grandmother
struck
him
many
times
in
coming
up
the
first
time
he
did
not
strike
her
at
all
every
time
they
ran
down
she
struck
him
less
and
every
time
they
ran
up
he
struck
her
more
they
ran
up
and
down
for
three
days
and
at
the
end
of
that
time
she
could
not
strike
him
once
and
he
struck
her
at
every
step
she
took
he
had
now
become
a
great
runner
when
he
was
fifteen
years
of
age
the
old
woman
went
with
him
to
a
hurling
match
between
the
forces
of
his
grandfather
and
those
of
a
neighboring
king
both
sides
were
equal
in
skill
and
neither
was
able
to
win
till
the
youth
opposed
his
grandfather
people
then
he
won
every
game
when
the
ball
was
thrown
in
the
air
he
struck
it
coming
down
and
so
again
and
again
never
letting
the
ball
touch
the
ground
till
he
had
driven
it
through
the
barrier
the
old
king
who
was
very
angry
and
greatly
mortified
at
the
defeat
of
his
people
exclaimed
as
he
saw
the
youth
who
was
very
fair
and
had
white
hair

white
cap

the
name
of

king
ordered
his
people
to

and
put
the
young
man
to

on
the
spot
the
old
woman
hurried
to
the
side
of
her
grandson
they
slipped
from
the
crowd
and
away
they
went
a
hill
at
a
leap
a
glen
at
a
step
and
miles
at
a
they
ran
a
long
distance
till
fin

then
the
old
grandmother
took
him
on
her
back
putting
his
feet
into
two
pockets
which
were
in
her
dress
one
on
each
side
and

swiftness

cave
in
which
they
found
a
herd
of
goats
at
the
further
end
of
the
cave
was
a
smouldering
fire
the
two
lay
down
to
rest
a
couple
of
hours
later
in
came
a
giant
with
a
salmon
in
his
hand
this
giant
was
of
awful
height
he
had
but
one
eye
and
that
in
the
middle
of
his
forehead
as
large
as
the
sun
in
heaven
when
he
saw
fin
he
called
out
here
take
this
salmon
and
roast
it
but
be
careful
for
if
you
raise
a
single
blister
on
it
i
cut
the
head
off
you
i
followed
this
salmon
for
three
days
and
three
nights
without
stopping
and
i
never
let
it
out
of
my
sight
for
it
is
the
most
wonderful
salmon
in
the
world
the
giant
lay
down
to
sleep
in
the
middle
of
the
cave
fin
spitted
the
salmon
and
held
it
over
the
fire
the
minute
the
giant
closed
the
one
eye
in
his
head
he
began
to
snore
every
time
he
drew
breath
into
his
body
he
dragged
fin
the
spit
the
salmon
bran
and
all
the
goats
to
his
mouth
and
every
time
he
drove
a
breath
out
of
himself
he
threw
them
back
to
the
places
they
were
in
before
fin
was
drawn
time
after
time
to
the
mouth
of
the
giant
with
such
force
that
he
was
in
dread
of
going
down
his
throat
when
partly
cooked
a
blister
rose
on
the
salmon
fin
pressed
the
place
with
his
thumb
to
know
could
he
break
the
blister
and
hide
from
the
giant
the
harm
that
was
done
but
he
burned
his
thumb
and
to
ease
the
pain
put
it
between
his
teeth
and
gnawed
the
skin
to
the
flesh
the
flesh
to
the
bone
the
bone
to
the
marrow
and
when
he
had
tasted
the
marrow
he
received
the
knowledge
of
all
things
next
moment
he
was
drawn
by
the
breath
of
the
giant
right
up
to
his
face
and
knowing
from
his
thumb
what
to
do
he
plunged
the
hot
spit
into
the
sleeping
eye
of
the
giant
and
destroyed
it
that
instant
the
giant
with
a
single
bound
was
at
the
low
entrance
of
the
cave
and
standing
with
his
back
to
the
wall
and
a
foot
on
each
side
of
the
opening
roared
out
you
not
leave
this
place
alive
now
fin
killed
the
largest
goat
skinned
him
as
quickly
as
he
could
then
putting
the
skin
on
himself
he
drove
the
herd
to
where
the
giant
stood
the
goats
passed
out
one
by
one
between
his
legs
when
the
great
goat
came
the
giant
took
him
by
the
horns
fin
slipped
from
the
skin
and
ran
out
oh
you
escaped
said
the
giant
but
before
we
part
let
me
make
you
a
present
i
afraid
to
go
near
you
said
fin
if
you
wish
to
give
me
a
present
put
it
out
this
way
and
then
go
back
the
giant
placed
a
ring
on
the
ground
then
went
back
fin
took
up
the
ring
and
put
it
on
the
end
of
his
little
finger
above
the
first
joint
it
clung
so
firmly
that
no
man
in
the
world
could
have
taken
it
off
the
giant
then
called
out
where
are
you
on
fin
finger
cried
the
ring
that
instant
the
giant
sprang
at
fin
and
almost
came
down
on
his
head
thinking
in
this
way
to
crush
him
to
bits
fin
sprang
to
a
distance
again
the
giant
asked
where
are
you
on
fin
finger
answered
the
ring
again
the
giant
made
a
leap
coming
down
just
in
front
of
fin
many
times
he
called
and
many
times
almost
caught
fin
who
could
not
escape
with
the
ring
on
his
finger
while
in
this
terrible
struggle
not
knowing
how
to
escape
bran
ran
up
and
asked
why
do
you
chew
your
thumb
fin
bit
his
thumb
to
the
marrow
and
then
knew
what
to
do
he
took
the
knife
with
which
he
had
skinned
the
goat
cut
off
his
finger
at
the
first
joint
and
threw
it
with
the
ring
still
on
into
a
deep
bog
near
by
again
the
giant
called
out
where
are
you
and
the
ring
answered
on
fin
finger
straightway
the
giant
sprang
towards
the
voice
sank
to
his
shoulders
in
the
bog
and
stayed
there
fin
with
bran
now
went
on
his
way
and
travelled
till
he
reached
a
deep
and
thick
wood
where
a
thousand
horses
were
drawing
timber
and
men
felling
and
preparing
it
what
is
this

fin
of
the
overseer

his
thumb
to
the
marrow
and
then

eastern
side
of
the
world
there
lived
an
old
hag
with
her
three

torches
upon

thatched

moment

that
he
was

and
the
battle
fiercer
but
for
bran
fin
would
have
lost
his
life
that
night
the
old
woman
was
raging
at
the
delay
and
said
to
her
eldest
son
who

and
threw
his
torches
upon
the
roof
they
had
just
singed
the
straw
a
little
when
bran
pushed
them
off
with
such
force
that
they
fell
into
the
stream
and
were
quenched
who
is
this
screamed
who
dares
to
interfere
with
my
ancestral
right
i
shouted
fin
then
the
struggle

fiercer
than
with
the
second
brother
bran
helped
from
behind
tearing
the
flesh
from
his
head
to
his
heels
but
at
length
fastened
his
teeth
into
fin
breast
biting
and
gnawing
till
fin
cut
the
head
off
the
body

to
the
ground
but
the
head
lived

as
terribly
as
before

what
they
could
it
was
impossible
to
kill
it
fin
hacked
and
cut
but

neither
kill
nor
pull
it
off
when
nearly
exhausted
bran
said
why
do
you
chew
your
thumb
fin
chewed
his
thumb
and
reaching
the
marrow
knew
that
the
old
woman
in
the
east
was
ready
to
start
with
torches
to
find
her
sons
and
burn
the
dun
herself
and
that
she
had
a
vial
of
liquid
with
which
she
could
bring
the
sons
to
life
and
that
nothing
could
free
him
from
but
the
old
woman
blood
after
midnight
the
old
hag
enraged
at
the
delay
of
her
sons
started
and
shot
through
the
air
like
lightning
more
swiftly
than
her
sons
she
threw
her
torches
from
afar
upon
the
roof
of
the
dun
but
bran
as
before
hurled
them
into
the
stream
now
the
old
woman
circled
around
in
the
air
looking
for
her
sons

was
getting
very
weak
from
pain
and
loss
of
blood
for

biting
at
his
breast
all
the
time
bran
called
out

yourself
oh

all
your
power
or

are
lost
if
the
old
hag
gets
a
drop
from

vial
upon
the
bodies
of
her
sons
they
will
come
to
life
and
then
we
done
for
thus
roused
fin
with
one
spring
reached
the
old
woman
in
the
air
and
swept
the
bottle
from
her
grasp
which
falling
upon
the
ground
was
emptied
the
old
hag
gave
a
scream
which
was
heard
all
over
the
world

to
the
ground
and
closed
with
fin
then
followed
a
battle
greater
than
the
world
had
ever
known
before
that
night
or
has
ever
seen
since
water
sprang
out
of
gray
rocks

their
calves
even
when
they
had
none
and
hard
rushes
grew
soft
in
the
remotest
corner
of
erin
so
desperate
was
the
fighting
and
so
awful
between
fin
and
the
old
hag

would
have
died
that
night
but
for
bran
just
as
daylight

some
of
her
blood
and
rubbed
it
around

rubbed
his

wounds
with
the
blood
and

some
on

when

stranger
from

world
came
to

pleasant
or
agreeable
at

fin
and
his
men
took
counsel
together
they
were
much
annoyed
because

word
always
silent
while
discussing
what
kind
of
man
he
was

as
heartily
as

the
first
laugh
they
had
heard
from

the
strange
champion
saw
all
their
feats
of
arms
and
practised
with

till
the
year

a
day

they
went
a
glen
at
a
step
a
hill
at
a
leap
and
miles
at
a
running
leap
till
they
came
to
the
grand
castle
where
the
feast
was
to
be
given
they
went
in
everything

at

always
very
sportive
fond
of

conan
maol
macmorna
never
a
man
spoke
well
of
him
no

he
used
to
lie
on
the
flat
of
his
back
on
the
floor
at
fin
castle
when
all
were
seated
the
door
of
the
castle
closed
of
itself
fin
then
asked
the
man
nearest
the
door
to
rise
and
open
it
the
man
tried
to
rise
he
pulled
this
way
and
that
over
and
hither
but
he
could
get
up
then
the
next
man
tried
and
the
next
and
so
on
till
the
turn
came
to
fin
himself
who
tried
in
vain
now
whenever
fin
and
his
men
were
in
trouble
and
great
danger
it
was
their
custom
to
raise
a
cry
of
distress
a
voice
of
howling
heard
all
over
erin
then
all
men
knew
that
they
were
in
peril
of
death
for
they
never
raised
this
cry
except
in
the
last
extremity
fin
son
fialan
who
was
three
years
old
and
in
the
cradle
heard
the
cry
was
roused
and
jumped
up

me
a
sword
said
he
to
the
nurse

father
and
his
men

in
distress

must
go
to
aid
them
what
could
you
do
poor
little
child
fialan
looked
around
saw
an
old
rusty
laid
aside
for
ages
he
took
it
down
gave
it
a
snap
it
sprang
up
so
as
to
hit
his
arm
and
all
the
rust
dropped
off
the
blade
was
pure
as
shining
silver
this
will
do
said
he
and
then
he
set
out
towards
the
place
where
he
heard
the
cry
going
a
glen
at
a
step
a
hill
at
a
leap
and
miles
at
a
running
leap
till
he
came
to
the
door
of
the
castle
and
cried
out
fin
answered
from
inside
is
that
you
my
child
it
is
said
fialan
why
did
you
come
i
heard
your
cry
and
how
could
i
stay
at
home
hearing
the
cry
of
my
father
and
the
fenians
of
erin
oh
my
child
you
can
not
help
us
much
fialan
struck
the
door
powerfully
with
his
sword
but
no
use
then
one
of
the
men
inside
asked
fin
to
chew
his
thumb
to
know
what
was
keeping
them
in
and
why
they
were
bound
fin
chewed
his
thumb
from
skin
to
blood
from
blood
to
bone
from
bone
to
marrow
and
discovered
that
fear
dubh
had
built
the
castle
by
magic
and
that
he
was
coming
himself
with
a
great
force
to
cut
the
head
off
each
one
of
them
these
men
from
alba
had
always
a
grudge
against
the
champions
of
erin
said
fin
to
fialan
do
you
go
now
and
stand
at
the
ford
near
the
castle
and
meet
fear
dubh
fialan
went
and
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
ford
he
was
long
there
when
he
saw
fear
dubh
coming
with
a
great
army
leave
the
ford
my
child
said
fear
dubh
who
knew

once

a
pleasant
year

his
castle

fear
dubh
i
will
not
let
you

so
long
as
i
alive
before
you
said
fialan
the
men
faced
him
and
if
they
did
fialan
kept
his
place
and
a
battle
commenced
the
like
of
which
was
never
seen
before
that
day
fialan
went
through
the
army
as
a
hawk
through
a
flock
of
sparrows
on
a
march
morning
till
he
killed
every
man
except
fear
dubh
fear
dubh
told
him
again
to
leave
the
ford
he
did
want
to
harm
his
father
oh
said
fialan
i
know
well
what
you
want
if
you
do
leave
that
place
i
make
you
leave
it
said
fear
dubh
then
they
closed
in
combat
and
such
a
combat
was
never
seen
before
between
any
two
warriors
they
made
springs
to
rise
through
the
centre
of
hard
gray
rocks
cows
to
cast
their
calves
whether
they
had
them
or
not
all
the
horses
of
the
country
were
racing
about
and
neighing
in
dread
and
fear
and
all
created
things
were
terrified
at
the
sound
and
clamor
of
the
fight
till
the
weapons
of
fear
dubh
went
to
pieces
in
the
struggle
and
fialan
made
two
halves
of
his
own
sword
now
they
closed
in
wrestling
in
the
first
round
fialan
put
fear
dubh
to
his
knees
in
the
hard
bottom
of
the
river
the
second
round
he
put
him
to
his
hips
and
the
third
to
his
shoulders
now
said
he
i
have
you
giving
him
a
stroke
of
the
half
of
his
sword
which
cut
the
head
off
him
then
fialan
went
to
the
door
of
the
castle
and
told
his
father
what
he
had
done
fin
chewed
his
thumb
again
and
knew
what
other
danger
was
coming
my
son
said
he
to
fialan
fear
dubh
has
a
younger
brother
more
powerful
than
he
was
that
brother
is
coming
against
us
now
with
greater
forces
than
those
which
you
have
destroyed
as
soon
as
fialan
heard
these
words
he
hurried
to
the
ford
and
waited
till
the
second
army
came
up
he
destroyed
this
army
as
he
had
the
other
and
closed
with
the
second
brother
in
a
fight
fiercer
and
more
terrible
than
the
first
but
at
last
he
thrust
him
to
his
armpits
in
the
hard
bottom
of
the
river
and
cut
off
his
head
then
he
went
to
the
castle
and
told
his
father
what
he
had
done
a
third
time
fin
chewed
his
thumb
and
said
my
son
a
third
army
more
to
be
dreaded
than
the
other
two
is
coming
now
to
destroy
us
and
at
the
head
of
it
is
the
youngest
brother
of
fear
dubh
the
most
desperate
and
powerful
of
the
three
again
fialan
rushed
off
to
the
ford
and
though
the
work
was
greater
than
before
he
left
not
a
man
of
the
army
alive
then
he
closed
with
the
youngest
brother
of
fear
dubh
and
if
the
first
and
second
battles
were
terrible
this
was
more
terrible
by
far
but
at
last
he
planted
the
youngest
brother
up
to
his
armpits
in
the
hard
bottom
of
the
river
and
swept
the
head
off
him
now
after
the
heat
and
struggle
of
combat
fialan
was
in
such
a
rage
that
he
lost
his
mind
from
fury
not
having
any
one
to
fight
against
and
if
the
whole
world
had
been
there
before
him
he
would
have
gone
through
it
and
conquered
it
all
but
having
no
one
to
face
him
he
rushed
along
the
tearing
the
flesh
from
his
own
body
never
had
such
madness
been
seen
in
any
created
being
before
that
day
diarmuid
came
now
and
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
castle
having
the
dog
bran
with
him
and
asked
fin
what
had
caused
him
to
raise
the
cry
of
distress
oh
diarmuid
said
fin
we
are
all
fastened
in
here
to
be
killed
fialan
has
destroyed
three
armies
and
fear
dubh
with
his
two
brothers
he
is
raging
now
along
the
bank
of
the
river
you
must
not
go
near
him
for
he
would
tear
you
limb
from
limb
at
this
moment
he
would
spare
me
his
own
father
but
after
a
while
he
will
cease
from
raging
and
die
down
then
you
can
go
the
mother
of
fear
dubh
is
coming
and
will
soon
be
at
the
ford
she
is
more
violent
more
venomous
more
to
be
dreaded
a
greater
warrior
than
her
sons
the
chief
weapon
she
has
are
the
nails
on
her
fingers
each
nail
is
seven
perches
long
of
the
hardest
steel
on
earth
she
is
coming
in
the
air
at
this
moment
with
the
speed
of
a
hawk
and
she
has
a
kŭŕan
a
small
vessel
with
liquor
in
it
which
has
such
power
that
if
she
puts
three
drops
of
it
on
the
mouths
of
her
sons
they
will
rise
up
as
well
as
ever
and
if
she
brings
them
to
life
there
is
nothing
to
save
us
go
to
the
ford
she
will
be
hovering
over
the
corpses
of
the
three
armies
to
know
can
she
find
her
sons
and
as
soon
as
she
sees
them
she
will
dart
down
and
give
them
the
liquor
you
must
rise
with
a
mighty
bound
upon
her
dash
the
kŭŕan
out
of
her
hand
and
spill
the
liquor
if
you
can
kill
her
save
her
blood
for
nothing
in
the
world
can
free
us
from
this
place
and
open
the
door
of
the
castle
but
the
blood
of
the
old
hag
i
in
dread
you
not
succeed
for
she
is
far
more
terrible
than
all
her
sons
together
go
now
fialan
is
dying
away
and
the
old
woman
is
coming
make
no
delay
diarmuid
hurried
to
the
ford
stood
watching
a
while
then
he
saw
high
in
the
air
something
no
larger
than
a
hawk
as
it
came
nearer
and
nearer
he
saw
it
was
the
old
woman
she
hovered
high
in
the
air
over
the
ford
at
last
she
saw
her
sons
and
was
swooping
down
when
diarmuid
rose
with
a
bound
into
the
air
and
struck
the
vial
a
league
out
of
her
hand
the
old
hag
gave
a
shriek
that
was
heard
to
the
eastern
world
and
screamed
who
has
dared
to
interfere
with
me
or
my
sons
i
answered
diarmuid
and
you
not
go
further
till
i
do
to
you
what
has
been
done
to
your
sons
the
fight
began
and
if
there
ever
was
a
fight
before
or
since
it
could
not
be
more
terrible
than
this
one
but
great
as
was
the
power
of
diarmuid
he
never
could
have
conquered
but
for
bran
the
dog
the
old
woman
with
her
nails
stripped
the
skin
and
flesh
from
diarmuid
almost
to
the
vitals
but
bran
tore
the
skin
and
flesh
off
the
old
woman
back
from
her
head
to
her
heels
from
the
dint
of
and
fighting
diarmuid
was
growing
faint
despair
came
on
him
and
he
was
on
the
point
of
giving
way
when
a
little
robin
flew
near
to
him
and
sitting
on
a
bush
spoke
saying
oh
diarmuid
take
strength
rise
and
sweep
the
head
off
the
old
hag
or
fin
and
the
fenians
of
erin
are
no
more
diarmuid
took
courage
and
with
his
last
strength
made
one
great
effort
swept
the
head
off
the
old
hag
and
caught
her
blood
in
a
vessel
he
rubbed
some
on
his
own
wounds
they
were
cured
then
he
cured
bran
straightway
he
took
the
blood
to
the
castle
rubbed
drops
of
it
on
the
door
which
opened
and
he
went
in
all
laughed
with
joy
at
the
rescue
he
freed
fin
and
his
men
by
rubbing
the
blood
on
the
chairs
but
when
he
came
as
far
as
conan
maol
the
blood
gave
out
all
were
going
away
why
should
you
leave
me
here
after
you
cried
conan
maol
i
would
rather
die
at
once
than
stay
here
for
a
lingering
death
why
do
you
oscar
and
you
gol
macmorna
come
and
tear
me
out
of
this
place
anyhow
you
be
able
to
drag
the
arms
out
of
me
and
kill
me
at
once
better
that
than
leave
me
to
die
alone
oscar
and
gol
took
each
a
hand
braced
their
feet
against
his
feet
put
forth
all
their
strength
and
brought
him
standing
but
if
they
did
he
left
all
the
skin
and
much
of
the
flesh
from
the
back
of
his
head
to
his
heels
on
the
floor
behind
him
he
was
covered
with
blood
and
by
all
accounts
was
in
a
terrible
condition
bleeding
and
wounded
now
there
were
sheep
grazing
near
the
castle
the
fenians
ran
out
killed
and
skinned
the
largest
and
best
of
the
flock
and
clapped
the
fresh
skin
on
conan
back
and
such
was
the
healing
power
in
the
sheep
and
the
wound
very
fresh
that
conan
back
healed
and
he
marched
home
with
the
rest
of
the
men
and
soon
got
well
and
if
he
did
they
sheared
off
his
back
wool
enough
every
year
to
make
a
pair
of
stockings
for
each
one
of
the
fenians
of
erin
and
for
fin
himself
and
that
was
a
great
thing
to
do
and
useful
for
wool
was
scarce
in
erin
in
those
days
fin
and
his
men
lived
pleasantly
and
joyously
for
some
time
and
if
they
did
may
we
fin
maccumhail
and
the
knight
of
the
full
axe
there
was
a
day
when
fin
went
on
an
expedition
by
himself
he
walked
out
to
his
currochán
on
the
seashore
gave
it
a
kick
that
sent
it
out
nine
leagues
from
land
then
with
a
spring
he
jumped
into
the
boat
and
rowed
over
the
sea
after
he
had
gone
some
distance
he
saw
a
giant
coming
towards
him
walking
through
the
water
which
did
not
reach
his
knees
looking
up
fin
could
see
nothing
between
the
head
of
the
giant
and
the
sky
with
one
step
the
giant
was
in
front
of
fin
and
it
seemed
that
he
and
his
boat
would
be
lost
in
a
moment
between
the
legs
of
the
terrible
monster
poor
little
helpless
creature
what
brings
you
here
in
my
way
asked
the
giant
he
was
just
going
to
lay
hold
of
the
boat
and
toss
it
far
off
to
one
side
when
fin
called
out
wo
you
give
fair
play
just
let
me
put
foot
on
solid
land
and
see
what
will
happen
do
attack
me
here
i
not
afraid
to
meet
you
once
i
have
earth
for
my
two
feet
to
stand
on
if
that
is
all
you
want
i
can
take
you
to
land
very
soon
and
seizing
the
boat
as
he
would
a
the
giant
drew
it
to
the
shore
of
the
sea
opposite
to
that
from
which
fin
started
and
in
front
of
his
own
castle
what
will
you
do
now
asked
the
giant
i
fight
with
you
said
fin
the
giant
brought
out
his
which
had
a
blade
seven
acres
in
size
fin
was
ready
with
his
sword
and
now
began
a
most
terrible
battle
fin
faced
the
giant
slashing
at
him
with
his
sword
and
when
the
giant
made
an
offer
of
the
axe
at
him
fin
would
dart
to
one
side
and
when
the
axe
missing
him
struck
the
ground
it
went
into
the
handle
the
giant
was
a
long
time
striving
to
know
could
he
draw
out
the
axe
and
while
at
this
fin
ran
behind
and
cut
steps
with
his
sword
into
the
leg
of
his
enemy
and
by
the
time
the
giant
had
the
axe
out
of
the
ground
fin
was
ready
for
him
again
and
in
front
of
him
striking
and
vexing
him
with
his
sword
it
was
another
long
while
till
a
blow
came
down
and
when
the
axe
went
into
the
ground
again
fin
ran
behind
a
second
time
cut
more
steps
in
the
leg
and
body
of
the
giant
so
as
to
reach
his
neck
and
cut
the
head
off
him
when
the
axe
was
coming
to
the
ground
the
third
time
fin
slipped
and
fell
under
one
corner
of
it
and
between
the
feet
of
the
giant
who
closed
his
legs
with
a
clap
that
was
heard
to
the
end
of
the
western
world
he
thought
to
catch
fin
but
fin
was
too
quick
for
him
and
though
badly
hurt
he
was
able
to
cut
more
steps
and
climb
to
the
neck
of
the
giant
with
one
blow
he
swept
the
head
off
him
and
a
big
head
it
was
by
all
accounts
as
broad
as
the
moon
the
battle
was
fought
in
front
of
the
giant
castle
fin
was
terribly
wounded
the
axe
had
cut
that
deep
that
his
bowels
were
to
be
seen
he
dropped
at
the
side
of
the
giant
and
lay
helpless
on
the
ground
after
the
fall
of
the
giant
twelve
women
came
out
of
his
castle
and
when
they
drew
near
and
saw
him
dead
they
laughed
from
joy
but
seeing
fin
with
his
wound
they
began
to
mourn
oh
then
said
fin
is
it
making
sport
of
me
you
are
after
the
evil
day
that
i
had

it
is
not
we

twelve
daughters
of
kings
stolen
from
our
fathers
we
saw
the
giant
fall
and
came
here
to
look
at
him
dead
we
grieve
for
you
and
mourn
for
the
sorrow
that
is
on
you
but
we
are
so
glad
the
giant
is
killed
that
we
can
not
help
laughing
well
said
fin
if
you
mourn
for
me
and
are
glad
that
i
have
killed
the
giant
will
you
carry
me
to
my
currochán

me
in
it
and
push
it
out
to
sea

waves

bear
me
home
and
i
care
for
nothing
else
if
only
one
day
my
bones
may
come
to
land
in
erin
the
twelve
women
took
him
up
carefully
and
put
him
in
the
boat
and
when
the
tide
came
they
pushed
it
out
to
sea
fin
lay
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
barely
alive
it
floated
along
and
he
was
borne
over
the
waves
hither
and
thither
went
the
boat
till
at
last
one
day
a
blackbird
came
down
on
the
body
of
fin
maccumhail
and
began
to
pick
at
his
entrails
the
blackbird
said
many
a
long
day

i
watched
and
waited
for
this
chance
and
glad

i
to
have
it
now
that
moment
the
blackbird
turned
into
a
little
man
not
more
than
three
feet
high
then
he
said
i
was
under
a
druidic
spell
to
be
a
blackbird
till

bites
of
fat
from

entrails
of

he
put
fin
entrails
into
their
proper
place
rubbed
him
with
an
ointment
that
he
had
and
fin
was
well
as
ever

consented

last
and
with
the
knight
of
the
full
axe
landed

the
boat
on
shore
and
went
to
the
king
castle
there
was
noise
and
tumult
great
crowds
of
people
had
come
to
do
honor
to
the
daughter
never
before
had
such
preparations
been
made
in
that
kingdom
the
knight
of
the
full
axe
knocked
at
the
door
and
asked
admission
for
himself
and
fin
maccumhail
monarch
of
erin
shipwrecked
on
that
shore
the
country
was
north
of
erin
far
out
in
the
sea
the
attendants
said
no
strangers
may
enter
here
but
there
is
a
great
house
further
on
go
there
and
welcome
the
house
to
which
they
were
directed
was
miles
long
ten
miles
wide
and
about
five
miles
distant
from
the
castle
inhabited
by
the
strangest
men
in
the
world
of
the
king
fed
from
the
king
house
and
a
terrible
feeding
it
was
human
flesh
all
strangers
who
came
to
the
king
castle
were
sent
to
that
house
where
the
guards
tore
them
to
pieces
and
ate
them
up
these
guards
had
to
be
fed
well
if
not
they
would
devour
the
whole
country
with
fin
and
the
knight
of
the
full
axe
there
went
a
messenger
who
was
careful
not
to
go
near
the
house
he
pointed
it
out
from
a
distance
and
ran
home
fin
and
the
knight
knocked
at
the
door
when
it
was
opened
all
inside
laughed
as
they
laughed
fin
could
see
their
hearts
and
livers
they
were
so
glad
the
knight
of
the
full
axe
asked
why
do
you
laugh
in
this
way
oh
answered
they
we
laugh
because
you
are
so
small
you
not
make
a
mouthful
for
one
of
us
the
guards
barred
the
door
and
put
a
prop
against
it
now
the
knight
put
a
second
prop
against
the
door
the
guards
asked
why
do
you
do
that
i
do
it
so
none
of
you
may
escape
me
answered
the
knight
then
seizing
two
of
the
largest
of
the
guards
one
in
each
hand
he
used
them
as
clubs
and
killed
the
others
with
them
he
ran
the
length
of
the
house
striking
right
and
left
till
he
walloped
the
life
out
of
all
that
was
in
it
but
the
two
to
them
he
said
i
spare
you
to
clean
out
the
house
and
make
the
place
fit
for
the
monarch
of
erin
to
spend
the
night
in
bring
rushes
and
make
ready
to
receive
fin
maccumhail
and
from
wherever
they
got
them
they
brought
two
baskets
of
rushes
each
basket
as
big
as
a
mountain
and
spread
litter
on
the
ground
two
feet
deep
through
the
whole
house
and
then
at
the
knight
command
they
brought
a
pile
of
turf
and
made
a
grand
fire
late
in
the
evening
the
king
attendants
brought
food
which
they
left
near
the
house
of
the
guards
these
monsters
were
fed
twice
a
day
morning
and
evening
to
their
great
surprise
the
attendants
saw
the
bodies
of
the
dead
giants
piled
up
outside
the
house
they
ran
off
quickly
to
tell
the
news
now
the
knight
of
the
full
axe
sat
by
the
fire
the
two
guards
that
he
had
spared
tried
to
chat
and
be
agreeable
but
the
knight
snapped
at
them
and
said
what
company
are
you
for
the
monarch
of
erin
then
he
caught
the
two
squeezed
the
life
out
of
them
and
threw
them
on
the
pile
outside
now
said
the
knight
to
fin
there
is
no
suitable
food
for
you
i
must
get
you
something
good
to
eat
from
the
castle
so
off
he
started
reached
the
castle
quickly
knocked
at
the
door
and
demanded
the
best
of
food
saying
is
fine
treatment
you
are
giving
the
monarch
of
erin
they
trembled
at
the
voice
of
the
little
man
and
without
words
or
delay
gave
him
the
best
they
had
in
the
castle
he
carried
it
back
and
placed
it
before
fin
now
said
he
they
have
given
us
no
wine
we
must
have
wine
and
that
of
the
best
oh
we
have
no
need
of
wine
said
fin
but
off
went
the
knight
again
he
demanded
supplies
at
the
castle
he
took
a
hogshead
of
the
best
wine
threw
it
over
his
shoulder
and
as
he
hurried
out
he
struck
a
jamb
off
the
door
and
swept
it
along
with
the
hogshead
now
said
the
knight
after
they
had
eaten
and
drunk
is
too
bad
for
the
monarch
of
erin
to
sleep
on
rushes
he
should
have
the
best
bed
in
the
land
oh
trouble
yourself
no
further
said
fin
better
sleep
on
rushes
than
all
this
noise
but
the
knight
would
listen
to
nothing
away
he
went
to
the
castle
and
shouted

me
the
best
bed
in
this
place
i
want
it
for
fin
maccumhail
the
monarch
of
erin
they
gave
him
the
bed
in
a
moment
with
hurried
steps

was
back
and
said
to

this
bed

said
fin
who
was
getting
in
dread
of
the
knight
himself
no
you

the
princess
and
off
rushed
the
knight
he
entered
the
castle
all
were
in
terror
hither
and
thither
they
hurried
not
knowing
what
to
do
the
knight
of
the
full
axe
seized
the
princess
the
monarch
of
erin
is
a
better
man
than
your
bridegroom
said
he
and
clapping
her
under
his
arm
away
he
went
not
a
man
had
the
courage
to
stir
all
was
confusion
and
fear
in
the
king
castle
the
princess
was
gone
and
no
one
could
save
her
all
were
in
terrible
dread
knowing
what
had
been
done
at
the
long
house
at
last
an
old
hag
one
of
the
queen
said
i
go
and
see
what
has
become
of
the
princess
i
go
on
the
chimney
and
look
down
off
ran
the
hag
and
never
rested
till
she
was
on
the
top
of
the
chimney
sticking
down
her
head
to
know
what
could
she
see
the
chimney
was
wide
for
the
king
guards
had
cooked
all
their
food
below
on
the
fire
the
knight
of
the
full
axe
was
looking
up
at
the
time
and
saw
the
two
eyes
staring
down
at
him
go
on
out
of
that
cried
he
flinging
his
axe
which
stuck
in
the
old
woman
forehead
off
she
rushed
to
the
castle
she
had
seen
nothing
of
the
princess
all
she
knew
was
that
a
little
man
was
sitting
by
the
fire
warming
himself
that
he
had
thrown
his
axe
at
her
and
it
had
stuck
in
her
forehead
at
daylight
the
knight
spoke
to
fin
who
rose
at
once
now
said
he
i
have
no
strength
left
all
my
strength
is
in
the
axe
while
i
had
that
i
could
do
anything

i
can
do
nothing
we
are
in
great
danger
but
there
is
such
dread
of

people
here
that
we
may
mend
matters

and
vials
and
pretend

to
the
castle
and
say

take
the
axe
out
of
the
old
hag

that
without

to
the
castle
and
said
i
am
a
great
doctor
i
can
take
the
axe
out
of
the
old
woman
head
without
trouble
they
took
him
to
the
hag
who
was
sitting
upright
in
bed
her
head
was
so
sore
she
could
lie
down
he
felt
her
head
around
the
axe
sent
the
people
away
when
they
were
gone
he
took
hold
of
the
handle
with
one
snap
he
made
two
halves
of
the
old
woman
head
fin
ran
out
with
the
axe
leaving
the
old
hag
dead
behind
him
he
never
stopped
till
he
came
where
he
had
left
the
knight
fin
maccumhail
was
now
the
strongest
man
on
earth
and
the
knight
the
weakest

the
little
man
i

fin
it

know
its
value
and
feel

power
the
knight
was
glad
to
get
back
his
axe
and
now
the
two
set
out
for
erin
fin
kicked
the
boat
three
leagues
from
land
and
with
a
bound
they
both
came
down
in
it
and
floated
on
till
they
saw
the
coast
of
erin
then
the
little
man
said

time
you
have
only
to
look
over
your
right
shoulder
call

name
and
you
will
see
me
before

now
fin
sprang
ashore
he
had
been
absent
a
year
and
more
and
no
man
knew
where
he
was
while
gone
all
thought
him
lost

was
the
gladness
when

fenians
of

what
he
had

gilla
na

macri
na

and
lun
dubh
macsmola
when
their
time

the
young

settled
with
the
blacksmith
and
took
their
pay
of
him
after
they
had
eaten
breakfast
in
the
morning
they
went
away
together
when
they
had
gone
some
distance
from
the
house
they
changed
their
gait
so
that
when
they
took
one
step
forward
they
took
two
backwards
and
when
evening
came
they
were
not
five
perches
away
from
the
house
where
they
had
eaten
breakfast
in

then
one

and
went
back
to

the
blacksmith
welcomed

and
was
glad
you

said
they
we
have
not
come

to

and

said
the
blacksmith
i

we
open

two
doors
of

forge
and
let
you
and
the
maiden
go
in
and
stand
in
the
middle
of
the
place
then
do
you

and
the
man

her
the
three
came

one
man
went
out
at
each
door
of
the
forge
scéhide
followed
lun
dubh
when
he
saw
this
césa
spoke
up
and
said
i

but
turn

a
moment
here
to

turned
back
into
the
forge
and
césa
said

your
finger
on
this
anvil
lun
dubh
put
his
finger
on
the
anvil
césa
catching
up
a
good
spike
which
the
old
blacksmith
had
made
and
a
hammer
drove
the
spike
through
the
finger
of
lun
dubh
fastening
him
to
the
anvil
now
said
lun
dubh
to

so
he
freed
his
comrade
from

and
césa
another
with

went
along
he
bought
a
skin
at
every
house
where
he
could
find
one
until
he
had
enough
to
make
clothes
in
which
to
disguise
himself
for
he
was
in
dread
of
lun
dubh
on
account
of
the
first
blow
which
he
had
the
right
to
strike
when

met
he
put

well
said
gilla
as
long
as

in

ca
refuse

so
away
went

he
took
a
glen
at
a
step
and
a
hill
at
a
leap
till
he
came
to
the
shore
of
the
sea
where
he
caught
up
two
sticks
put
one
across
the
other
then
gave
them
a
tip
of
the
hand
and
a
fine
vessel
rose
out
of
the
two
pieces
of
wood
gilla
na
grakin
went
on
board
the
vessel
hoisted
the
sails
and
off
he
went
in
a
straight
line
the
music
he
heard
on
his
way
was
the
whistling
of
eels
in
the
sea
and
the
calling
of
gulls
in
the
air
till
he
came
under
the
king
castle
in
lochlin
when
he
came
there
were
hundreds
of
ships
standing
near
the
shore
and
he
had
to
anchor
outside
them
all
then
he
stepped
from
ship
to
ship
till
he
stood
on
land
what
should
there
be
at
the
time
he
landed
but
a
great
feast
in
the
castle
of
the
king
so
gilla
went
to
the
front
of
the
castle
and
stood
outside
at
the
door
but
he
could
go
no
further
for
the
crowd
and
no
one
looked
at
him
at
last
he
shouted
this
is
a
very
hospitable
feast
and
you
are
a
people
of
fine
manners
not
to
ask
a
stranger
is
he
hungry
or
thirsty
you
are
right
said
the
king
who
turned
to
the
people
and
said
give
the
pot
of
plenty
to
the
stranger
till
he
eats
his
fill
the
people
obeyed
the
king
and
when
gilla
na
grakin
got
hold
of
the
pot
he
made
for
the
ship
and
never
stopped
till
he
was
on
board
he
put
the
pot
in
a
safe
place
below
then
standing
on
deck
he
said
to
himself
it
is
no
use
to
take
the
pot
by
my
swiftness
unless
i
take
it
by
my
strength
so
he
turned
and
went
to
land
again
all
the
heroes
and
champions
of
the
king
of
lochlin
and
his
whole
army
were
ready
to
fight
but
if
they
were
so
was
gilla
na
grakin
when
he
came
up
to
the
army
he
began
and
went
through
it
as
a
hawk
goes
through
a
flock
of
swallows
till
he
made
one
heap
of
their
heads
and
another
heap
of
their
weapons
then
he
went
to
the
castle
caught
the
king
in
one
hand
and
the
queen
in
the
other
and
putting
them
under
his
two
arms
brought
them
out
in
front
of
the
castle
and
killed
each
with
the
other
all
was
quiet
and
still
at
the
castle
there
was
a
man
alive
to
stand
up
against
gilla
na
grakin
who
went
to
his
ship
raised
the
sails
and
started
for
erin
all
he
heard
was
the
spouting
of
whales
the
whistling
of
eels
the
calling
of
gulls
and
the
roar
of
the
wind
as
the
ship
rushed
back
to
the
place
where
he
had
made
it
in
erin
when
he
reached
that
place
he
gave
the
ship
a
tip
of
his
hand
and
there
before
him
was
the
pot
of
plenty
and
with
it
the
two
sticks
which
he
had
found
on
the
shore
of
the
sea
when
he
was
going
to
the
castle
of
the
king
of
lochlin
he
left

to
the
castle
of
fin
maccumhail
fin
and
all
the
fenians
of
erin
were
glad

to

he
said

said
he
to
the
king
of
the
flood
and
bring
me
his
cup
that
is
never
dry
when
he
heard
fin
words
gilla
went
off
without
delay
he
took
a
glen
at
a
step
and
a
hill
at
a
leap
till
he
came
to
the
sea
there
he
took
up
two
sticks
of
wood
threw
one
across
the
other
and
they
became
a
fine
large
ship
away
he
sailed
in
a
straight
line
listening
as
he
went
to
the
spouting
of
whales
the
whistling
of
eels
and
the
calling
of
gulls
and
never
stopped
till
he
anchored
outside
the
castle
of
the
king
of
the
flood
there
was
many
a
ship
at
land
before
him
so
he
stopped
outside
them
all
and
stepped
from
ship
to
ship
till
he
reached
the
shore
the
king
of
the
flood
was
giving
a
great
feast
that
day
gilla
na
grakin
went
to
the
castle
but
could
not
enter
so
great
was
the
throng
he
stood
at
the
door
a
while
and
then
called
out
you
are
an
people
not
to
ask
a
stranger
is
he
hungry
or
dry
the
king
heard
these
words
and
said
you
are
right
and
turning
to
his
people
said
give
this
stranger
the
cup
till
he
drinks
his
fill
as
soon
as
ever
gilla
got
the
cup
in
his
hands
he
made
for
the
ship
and
never
stopped
till
he
put
the
cup
in
the
hold
of
the
vessel
then
he
came
on
deck
and
thought
it
no
use
to
take
the
cup
with
my
swiftness
unless
i
take
it
with
my
strength
so
back
he
turned
to
the
castle
and
when
he
reached
land
the
whole
army
and
all
the
champions
of
the
king
of
the
flood
stood
ready
to
oppose
him
when
he
came
up
he
went
through
them
as
a
hawk
through
a
flock
of
swallows
he
made
a
heap
of
their
heads
in
one
place
and
a
heap
of
their
weapons
in
another
and
then
went
back
to
the
ship
without
thinking
of
the
king
and
the
queen
of
the
flood
forgot
them
he
raised
his
sails
and
went
away
listening
to
music
on
the
sea
till
he
touched
land
in
erin
then
he
took
the
cup
in
one
hand
struck
the
ship
with
the
other
turned
it
into
the
two
sticks
which
he
had
found

and

to

what
was
it
that
left
the
gruagach
with
the
one
hair
on
his
head
well
said
gilla
i
never
knew
that
you
wanted
to
put

till
this
minute
i
know
it
now
but
still
so
long
as
i
in
your
service
i
ca
refuse
to
do
your
work
then
gilla
na
grakin
stepped
out
of
the
castle
door
and
away
he
went
to
the
eastern
world
he
took
a
glen
at
a
step
a
hill
at
a
leap
and
lochs
and
seas
at
a
bound
till
he
entered
the
gruagach
house
in
the
eastern
world
what
is
your
errand
to
me
asked
the
gruagach
and
why
have
you
come
to
my
house
i
have
come
said
gilla
to
know
what
was
it
that
left
you
with
the
one
hair
on
your
head
sit
down
here
and
rest
yourself
and
if
you
are
a
good
man
i
tell
you
said
the
gruagach
when
bedtime
came
the
gruagach
said
there
is
an
iron
harrow
there
beyond
with
teeth
on
both
sides
of
it
go
now
and
stretch
yourself
on
that
harrow
and
sleep
till
morning
when
daylight
came
the
gruagach
was
on
his
feet
and
asked
gilla
was
he
up
i
am
said
he
after
they
had
eaten
breakfast
the
gruagach
went
to
another
room
and
brought
out
two
iron
loops
one
of
these
he
put
on
gilla
neck
and
the
other
on
his
own
and
then
they
began
to
jerk
the
loops
and
pull
one
another
and
they
fought
till
late
in
the
afternoon
neither
had
the
upper
hand
but
if
one
man
was
weaker
than
the
other
that
man
was
gilla
na
grakin
and
now
thought
he
to
himself
the
gruagach
will
take
my
life
and
my
wife
will
never
know
what
became
of
me
the
thought
gave
him
strength
and
power
so
up
he
sprang
and
with
the
first
pull
he
gave
he
put
the
gruagach
to
his
knees
in
the
ground
with
the
second
he
put
him
to
his
waist
with
the
third
to
his
shoulders
indeed
said
gilla
it
would
be
easier
for
me
to
strike
the
head
off
you
now
than
to
let
you
go
but
if
i
took
your
head
i
should
have
my
master
work
done
if
you
let
me
go
said
the
gruagach
i
tell
you
what
happened
to
me
and
why
i
have
but
the
one
hair
on
my
head
gilla
set
him
free
then
the
two
sat
down
together
and
the
gruagach
began
i
was
living
here
without
trouble
or
annoyance
from
any
man
till
one
day
a
hare
ran
in
made
an
unseemly
noise
under
that
table
there
and
insulted
us
i
was
here
myself
at
the
time
with
my
wife
and
my
son
and
my
daughter
and
we
had
a
hound
a
beagle
and
a
black
horse
the
hare
ran
out
from
under
the
table
and
i
made
after
the
hare
and
my
wife
and
son
and
daughter
with
the
horse
and
the
two
dogs
followed
me
when
the
hare
was
on
the
top
of
a
hill
i
had
almost
hold
of
his
hind
legs
but
i
never
caught
him
when
night
was
near
the
hare
came
to
the
walls
of
a
great
castle
and
as
he
was
jumping
over
i
hit
him
a
blow
on
the
hind
leg
with
a
stick
but
in
he
went
to
the
castle
out
came
an
old
hag
and
screamed
is
it
that
worried
the
pet
of
this
castle
i
said
it
was
myself
that
did
it
then
she
faced
me
and
made
at
me
and
the
fight
began
between
us
we
fought
all
that
night
and
the
next
day
till
near
evening
then
she
turned
around
and
pulled
a
druidic
rod
out
of
herself
ran
from
me
and
struck
my
wife
and
son
and
daughter
and
the
two
hounds
and
the
horse
with
the
druidic
rod
and
made
stones
of
them
then
she
turned
on
me
again
and
there
was
but
the
one
hair
left
on
my
head
from
the
desperate
fighting
and
she
looked
at
me
and
said
let
you
go
this
time
but
i
give
you
a
good
payment
before
you
leave
she
caught
hold
of
me
then
in
the
grip
of
her
one
hand
and
with
the
other
she
took
a
sharp
knife
and
stripped
all
the
skin
and
flesh
off
my
back
from
my
waist
to
my
heels
then
taking
the
skin
of
a
rough
shaggy
goat
she
clapped
it
on
to
me
in
place
of
my
own
skin
and
flesh
and
told
me
to
go
my
way
i
left
the
old
hag
and
the
castle
behind
but
the
skin
grew
to
me
and
i
wear
it
to
this
day
and
here
the
gruagach
turned
to
gilla
na
grakin
and
showed
him
the
goatskin
growing
on
his
body
in
place
of
his
own
skin
and
flesh
well
said
gilla
when
he
saw
the
shaggy
back
of
the
gruagach
does
that
hare
come
here
to
insult
you
yet
he
does
indeed
said
the
gruagach
but
i
have
taken
a
bite
nor
a
sup
off
that
table
since
his
first
visit
let
us
sit
down
there
now
said
gilla
na
grakin
they
sat
down
at
the
table
but
they
were
not
sitting
long
till
the
hare
came
repeated
the
insult
and
ran
out
gilla
na
grakin
made
after
the
hare
and
the
gruagach
after
gilla
gilla
ran
as
fast
as
ever
his
legs
could
carry
him
and
he
was
often
that
near
that
he
used
to
stretch
his
arm
out
after
the
hare
and
almost
catch
him
but
he
never
touched
him
till
near
night
when
he
was
clearing
the
wall
then
gilla
caught
him
by
the
two
hind
legs
and
swinging
him
over
his
own
shoulder
dashed
him
against
the
wall
tore
the
head
from
the
body
and
sent
it
bounding
across
the
courtyard
of
the
castle
out
rushed
an
old
hag
that
minute
she
had
but
one
tooth
and
that
in
her
upper
jaw
and
she
used
this
tooth
for
a
crutch
who
has
killed
the
pet
of
this
castle
shrieked
she
it
was
i
that
killed
him
said
gilla
na
grakin
then
the
two
made
at
one
another
the
hag
and
gilla
they
fought
all
that
night
and
next
day
with
their
fighting
they
made
the
hard
rocks
soft
and
water
to
spring
out
through
the
middle
of
them
all
the
land
of
the
eastern
world
was
trembling
as
the
evening
drew
near
and
if
one
of
the
two
was
getting
weak
from
the
struggle
and
tired
that
one
was
gilla
na
grakin
when
he
saw
this
he
thought
to
himself
is
it
a
pity
if
an
old
hag
puts
me
to
death
me
who
has
put
to
death
many
a
strong
hero
at
this
thought
he
sprang
up
and
seized
the
hag
with
the
first
thrust
which
he
gave
her
into
the
ground
he
put
her
to
the
knees
with
the
second
to
her
waist
with
the
third
to
her
shoulders
now
said
the
old
hag
to
gilla
do
kill
me
and
i
give
you
the
rod
of
druidism
which
i
have
between
my
skin
and
flesh
oh
you
wicked
old
wretch
i
have
that
after
your
death
and
no
thanks
to
you
said
gilla
with
that
he
swept
the
head
off
of
her
with
a
single
blow
then
the
head
jumped
at
the
body
and
tried
to
get
its
place
again
but
gilla
stood
between
them
and
kept
the
head
off
till
the
body
was
cold
then
he
took
out
the
rod
of
enchantment
from
between
the
skin
and
the
flesh
and
threw
the
body
and
the
head
of
the
old
hag
aside
the
gruagach

up
and
gilla
said

and

and

the
gruagach

with
him

with
the
rod
and
the
wife
the
son
the
daughter
the

to
the
gruagach

the
goatskin
from
his
body
and
gave
him
his
own
skin
and
flesh
back
again
with
the
power
of
the
rod
when
all
were
restored
they
started
for

there

now
all

a
sister
there
near

and
he
break
her
head
against

took
a
clew
from
his
pocket
and
threw
it
over
the
walls
of
the
castle
and
the
walls
were
so
high
that
no
bird
of

could
fly
over
them
then
they
fixed
a
rope
ladder
on
the
castle
wise

and
climber
went
up
the
ladder
and
at
break
of
day
they
brought
away
the
three
children
and
gave
them
to
the
king
of
france
that
morning
and
the
king
of
france
was
so
glad
when
he
saw
his
three
sons
that
he
said
to
fin

raging
after

wise
son
of

mal
macmulcan
coming

by
the
stern
and
pulled
it
down
till
the
masts
touched
the
sea
strong
caught

all
back
without

and
the
time
for

and
a
day
now

fin
on
the
top
of
my
castle
in
tara
of
the
kings
and
the
other
on
a
hill
in
mayo
and
you
stand
with
your
back
to
the
wind
and
your
face
to
the
storm
a
sheaf
of
wheat
on
the
ground
before
the
gate
will
be
all
you
have
to

and
any

fin
went
away
with
himself
and
iron
back
without

and
when
they
had
gone
as
far
as
a
large
wood
that
was
by
the
roadside
a
thick
fog
came
on
them
and
rain
and
they
sat
down
at
the
edge
of
the
wood
and
waited
soon
they
saw
a
boy
with
a
bow
and
arrows
shooting
birds
and
whenever
he
hit
a
bird
he
used
to
put
the
arrow
through
its
two
eyes
and
not
put
a
drop
of
blood
on
its
feathers
and
when
the
red
boy
came
near
fin
he
drew
his
bow

an
arrow
through

back
without
action
and
put
the
life
out
of
him
when

the
lot
fell
upon

he
raised

on
his
back
to
carry
him
and
the
first
leap
he
took
was
six
miles
and
every
step
a
mile
and
he
went
on
without
stopping
till
he
was
in
the
western
world
when
they
came
to
the
castle
of
curucha
na
gras

and
misty

fighting
blow
on

met
the
bakers
bringing
bread
from

bake
house
and
he
caught
all
their
loaves
from

and
ran
home
to

turned
to
go
home
but
on
the
way
he
met
twelve
boys
each
carrying
the
full
of
his
arms
of
bottles
of
wine
he
took
every
bottle
from
them
and
it
was
long
till

tent
now

fighting
blow
on
the
door
of
the
castle
out
flew
curucha
with
his
guardian
sword
in
his
hand
and
he
made
at
misty
with
the
first
blow
he
gave
him
he
took
an
ear
off
his
head
misty
sprang
back
drew
his
bow
and
sent
an
arrow
into
breast
it
flew
out
through
his
head
and
he
fell
lifeless
on
the
ground
then
misty
drew
his
knife
cut
off
the
head
and
carried
the
head
and
the
sword
to
fin
maccumhail
and
fin
was
glad
to
get
them

the
head
said
misty
and
put
it
on
top
of
the
holly
bush
out
here
above
us
fin
put
the
head
on
the
holly
bush
and
the
minute
he
put
it
there
the
head
burnt
the
bush
to
the
earth
and
the
earth
to
the
clay
then
they
took
the
best
horse
that
could
be
found
about
castle
fin
sat
on
the
horse
with
the
sword
and
head
in
front
of
him
and
misty
followed
behind
they
went
their
way
and
never
stopped
till
they
came
to
the
place
where
misty
sent
the
arrow
through
iron
back
without
action
and
killed
him
when
they
came
to
that
spot
misty
asked
fin
would
he
tell
him
a
story
and
fin
answered
i
have
no
story
to
tell
except
that
we
are
in
the
place
now
where
you
killed
my
man
oh
then
said
misty
i
glad
you
put
that
in
my
mind
for
i
give
him
back
to
you
now
so
they
went
and
took
iron
back
without
action
out
of
the
ground
then
misty
struck
him
with
a
rod
of
enchantment
which
he
had
and
brought
life
into
him
again
then
misty
turned
to
fin
and
said

a
brother
of
the
seven
boys
who
went
with
you
to
save
the
children
of
the
king
of
france
i
was
too
young
for
action
at
that
time
but
my
mother
sent
me
here
now
as
a
gift
to
help
you
and
tell
you
what
to
do
when
you
go
to
the
hag
she
ask
you
for
the
sword
but
you
not
give
it
you
only
show
it
to
her
and
when
she
has
seen
the
sword
she
ask
for
the
head
and
you
not
give
the
head
to
her
either
you
only
show
it
and
when
she
sees
the
head
she
open
her
mouth
with
joy
at
seeing
the
head
of
her
brother
and
when
you
see
her
open
her
mouth
be
sure
to
strike
her
on
the
breast
with
the
head
and
if
you
do
do
that
the
whole
world
would
be
able
to
kill
her
then
fin
left
misty
where
he
met
him
and
with
iron
back
without
action
he
made
for
tara
of
the
kings
when
he
came
in

of
the
old
hag
she
asked
him

asked
for
the
sword
but
she
did
get
it
fin
only
showed
it
to

then
she
asked
for
the
head
and
when
she
saw
the
head
she
opened
her

the
trunk
of
a
tree
brought
three
equal
parts
made
of

and
one
given

castle
the
dog
bran
with
him
he
wandered
on
going
further
and
further
from
the
castle
and
bran
after
him
at
last
he
saw
a
bright
light
and
went
towards
it
when
he
came
to
the
place
where
the
light
was
burning
he
saw
a
large
house
he
entered
the
house
and
when
inside
saw
a
great
company
of
most
strange
looking
men
drinking
out
of
a
single
cup
the
chief
of
the
party
who
was
sitting
on
a
high
place
gave
the
cup
to
the
man
nearest
him
and
when
he
had
drunk
his
fill
out
of
it
he
passed
it
to
his
neighbor
and
so
on
to
the
last
while
the
cup
was
going
the
round
of
the
company
the
chief
said
this
is
the
great
cup
that
was
taken
from
fin
maccumhail
a
hundred
years
ago
and
as
much
as
each
man
wishes
to
drink
he
always
gets
from
it
and
no
matter
how
many
men
there
may
be
or
what
they
wish
for
they
always
have
their
fill
dubh
sat
near
the
door
on
the
edge
of
the
crowd
and
when
the
cup
came
to
him
he
drank
a
little
then
slipped
out
and
hurried
away
in
the
dark
when
he
came
to
the
fountain
at
the
castle
of
fin
maccumhail
his
log
was
burned
as
the
second
lot
had
fallen
on
dun
it
was
now
his
turn
to
watch
so
he
set
fire
to
his
log
and
went
out
in
the
place
of
dubh
with
the
dog
bran
after
him
dun
walked
on
through
the
night
till
he
saw
a
fire
he
went
towards
it
and
when
he
had
come
near
he
saw
a
large
house
which
he
entered
and
when
inside
he
saw
a
crowd
of
strange
looking
men
fighting
they
were
ferocious
wonderful
to
look
at
and
fighting
wildly
the
chief
who
had
climbed
on
the
crossbeams
of
the
house
to
escape
the
uproar
and
struggle
called
out
to
the
crowd
below
stop
fighting
now
for
i
have
a
better
gift
than
the
one
you
have
lost
this
night
and
putting
his
hand
behind
his
belt
he
drew
out
a
knife
and
held
it
before
them
saying
here
is
the
wonderful
knife
the
small
knife
of
division
that
was
stolen
from
fin
maccumhail
a
hundred
years
ago
and
if
you
cut
on
a
bone
with
the
knife
you
get
the
finest
meat
in
the
world
and
as
much
of
it
as
ever
your
hearts
can
wish
for
then
he
passed
down
the
knife
and
a
bare
bone
to
the
man
next
him
and
the
man
began
to
cut
and
off
came
slices
of
the
sweetest
and
best
meat
in
the
world
the
knife
and
the
bone
passed
from
man
to
man
till
they
came
to
dun
who
cut
a
slice
off
the
bone
slipped
out
unseen
and
made
for
fin
castle
as
fast
as
his
two
legs
could
carry
him
through
the
darkness
and
over
the
ground
when
he
was
by
the
fountain
at
the
castle
his
part
of
the
log
was
burned
and
his
watch
at
an
end
now
glasán
set
fire
to
his
stick
of
wood
and
went
out
on
his
watch
and
walked
forward
till
he
saw
the
light
and
came
to
the
same
house
that
dubh
and
dun
had
visited
looking
in
he
saw
the
place
full
of
dead
bodies
and
thought
there
must
be
some
great
wonder
here
if
i
lie
down
in
the
midst
of
these
and
put
some
of
them
over
me
to
hide
myself
i
shall
be
able
to
see
what
is
going
on
he
lay
down
and
pulled
some
of
the
bodies
over
himself
he
was
there
long
when
he
saw
an
old
hag
coming
into
the
house
she
had
but
one
leg
one
arm
and
one
upper
tooth
which
was
as
long
as
her
leg
and
served
her
in
place
of
a
crutch
when
inside
the
door
she
took
up
the
first
corpse
she
met
and
threw
it
aside
it
was
lean
as
she
went
on
she
took
two
bites
out
of
every
fat
corpse
she
met
and
threw
every
lean
one
aside
she
had
her
fill
of
flesh
and
blood
before
she
came
to
glasán
and
as
soon
as
she
had
that
she
dropped
down
on
the
floor
lay
on
her
back
and
went
to
sleep
every
breath
she
drew
glasán
was
afraid
she
drag
the
roof
down
on
top
of
his
head
and
every
time
she
let
a
breath
out
of
her
he
thought
sweep
the
roof
off
the
house
then
he
rose
up
looked
at
her
and
wondered
at
the
bulk
of
her
body
at
last
he
drew
his
sword
hit
her
a
slash
and
if
he
did
three
young
giants
sprang
forth
glasán
killed
the
first
giant
the
dog
bran
killed
the
second
and
the
third
ran
away
glasán
now
hurried
back
and
when
he
reached
the
fountain
at

his
log
of
wood
was
burned
and

in
your
part
of
the
night
said
fin
to
glasán
i
went
out
said
glasán
with
the
dog
bran
and
walked
on
till
i
saw
a
light
and
when
i
came
to
the
light
i
saw
a
house
which
i
entered
inside
were
heaps
of
dead
men
killed
in
fighting
and
i
wondered
greatly
when
i
saw
them
at
last
i
lay
down
in
the
midst
of
the
corpses
put
some
of
them
over
me
and
waited
to
see
what
would
happen
soon
an
old
hag
came
in
at
the
door
she
had
but
one
arm
one
leg
and
the
one
tooth
out
of
her
upper
jaw
and
that
tooth
as
long
as
her
leg
and
she
used
it
for
a
crutch
as
she
hobbled
along
she
threw
aside
the
first
corpse
she
met
and
took
two
bites
out
of
the
second
for
she
threw
every
lean
corpse
away
and
took
two
bites
out
of
every
fat
one
when
she
had
eaten
her
fill
she
lay
down
on
her
back
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
went
to
sleep
i
rose
up
then
to
look
at
her
and
every
time
she
drew
a
breath
i
was
in
dread
she
would
bring
down
the
roof
of
the
house
on
the
top
of
my
head
and
every
time
she
let
a
breath
out
of
her
i
thought
she
sweep
the
roof
from
the
building
so
strong
was
the
breath
of
the
old
hag
then
i
drew
my
sword
and
cut
her
with
a
blow
but
if
i
did
three
young
giants
sprang
up
before
me
i
killed
the
first
bran
killed
the
second
but
the
third
escaped
i
walked
away
then
and
when
i
was
at
the
fountain
outside
daylight
had
come
and
my
log
was
burned
between
you
and
me
said
fin
it
would
have
been
as
well
if
you
had
let
the
old
hag
alone
i
am
greatly
in
dread
the
third
young
giant
will
bring
trouble
on
us
all
for
years
fin
maccumhail
and
the
fenians
of
erin
hunted
for
sport
alone
they
had
the
best
of
eating
from
the
small
knife
of
division
and
the
best
of
drinking
from
the
cup
that
was
never
dry
at
the
end
of
years
dubh
dun
and
glasán
went
away
and
one
day
as
fin
and
the
fenians
of
erin
were
hunting
on
the
hills
and
mountains
they
saw
a
fear
ruadh
a
red
haired
man
coming
toward
them
there
is
a
bright
looking
man
coming
this
way
said
fin
and
you
speak
to
him
oh
what
do
we
care
for
him
asked
conan
maol
do
be
rude
to
a
stranger
said
fin
the
fear
ruadh
came
forward
and
spoke
to
no
man
till
he
stood
before
fin
what
have
you
come
for
asked
fin
to
find
a
master
for
years
what
wages
do
you
ask
inquired
fin
no
wages
but
this
that
if
i
die
before
the
years
have
passed
i
shall
be
buried
on
inis
caol
light
island
i
give
you
those
wages
said
fin
and
he
hired
the
fear
ruadh
for
years
he
served
fin
for
twenty
years
to
his
satisfaction
but
toward
the
end
of
the
year
he
fell
into
a
decline
became
an
old
man
and
died
when
the
fear
ruadh
was
dead
the
fenians
of
erin
said
that
not
a
step
would
they
go
to
bury
him
but
fin
declared
that
he
would
break
his
word
for
any
man
and
must
take
the
corpse
to
inis
caol
fin
had
an
old
white
horse
which
he
had
turned
out
to
find
a
living
for
himself
as
he
could
on
the
hillsides
and
in
the
woods
and
now
he
looked
for
the
horse
and
found
that
he
had
become
younger
than
older
in
looks
since
he
had
put
him
out
so
he
took
the
old
white
horse
and
tied
a
coffin
with
the
body
of
the
fear
ruadh
in
it
on
his
back
then
they
started
him
on
ahead
and
away
he
went
followed
by
fin
and
twelve
men
of
the
fenians
of
erin
when
they
came
to
the
temple
on
inis
caol
there
were
no
signs
of
the
white
horse
and
the
coffin
but
the
temple
was
open
and
in
went
fin
and
the
twelve
there
were
seats
for
each
man
inside
they
sat
down
and
rested
awhile
and
then
fin
tried
to
rise
but
could
he
told
the
men
to
rise
but
the
twelve
were
fastened
to
the
seats
and
the
seats
to
the
ground
so
that
not
a
man
of
them
could
come
to
his
feet
oh
said
fin
i
in
dread
there
is
some
evil
trick
played
on
us
at
that
moment
the
fear
ruadh
stood
before
them
in
all
his
former
strength
and
youth
and
said
now
is
the
time
for
me
to
take
satisfaction
out
of
you
for
my
mother
and
brothers
then
one
of
the
men
said
to
fin
chew
your
thumb
to
know
is
there
any
way
out
of
this
fin
chewed
his
thumb
to
know
what
should
he
do
when
he
knew
he
blew
the
great
whistle
with
his
two
hands
which
was
heard
by
donogh
kamcosa
and
diarmuid
the
fear
ruadh
fell
to
and
killed
three
of
the
men
but
before
he
could
touch
the
fourth
donogh
and
diarmuid
were
there
and
put
an
end
to
him
now
all
were
free
and
fin
with
the
nine
men
went
back
to
their
castle
south
of
ballyshannon
fin
maccumhail
and
the
son
of
the
king
of
alba
on
a
day
fin
went
out
hunting
with
his
dog
bran
on
knock
an
ar
and
he
killed
so
much
game
that
he
did
know
what
to
do
with
it
or
how
to
bring
it
home
as
he
stood
looking
and
thinking
all
at
once
he
saw
a
man
running
towards
him
with
a
rope
around
his
waist
so
long
that
half
his
body
was
covered
with
it
and
the
man
was
of
such
size
that
as
he
ran
fin
could
see
the
whole
world
between
his
legs
and
nothing
between
his
head
and
the
sky
when
he
came
up
the
man
saluted
fin
who
answered
him

kindly

him
but
the
cowherd
jumped
aside
and
catching
the
gruagach
by

of
his
legs
threw
him
up
on
to
the
half
of

his
back
from
his
head
to
his
heels
on
the
floor
and
the
wall
behind
him
but
when
they
were
going
home
through
the
hills
of
tralee
they
found
a
sheep
on
the
way
killed
it
and
clapped
the
skin
on
conán
the
sheepskin
grew
to
his
body
and
he
was
so
well
and
strong
that
they
sheared
him
every
year
and
got
wool
enough
from
his
back
to
make
flannel
and
frieze
for
the
fenians
of
erin
ever
after
cucúlin
there
was
a
king
in
a
land
not
far
from
greece
who
had
two
daughters
and
the
younger
was
fairer
than
the
elder
daughter
this
old
king
made
a
match
between
the
king
of
greece
and
his
own
elder
daughter
but
he
kept
the
younger
one
hidden
away
till
after
the
marriage
then
the
younger
daughter
came
forth
to
view
and
when
the
king
of
greece
saw
her
he
would
look
at
his
own
wife
nothing
would
do
him
but
to
get
the
younger
sister
and
leave
the
elder
at
home
with
her
father
the
king
would
listen
to
this
would
agree
to
the
change
so
the
king
of
greece
left
his
wife
where
she
was
went
home
alone
in
a
terrible
rage
and
collected
all
his
forces
to
march
against
the
kingdom
of
his
he
soon
conquered
the
king
and
his
army
and
so
far
as
he
was
able
he
vexed
and
tormented
him
to
do
this
the
more
completely
he
took
from
him
a
rod
of
druidic
spells
enchantment
and
ring
of
youth
which
he
had
and
striking
the
elder
sister
with
the
rod
he
said
you
will
be
a
serpent
of
the
sea
and
live
outside
there
in
the
bay
by
the
castle
then
turning
to
the
younger
sister
whose
name
was
gil
an
og
he
struck
her
and
said
you
be
a
cat
while
inside
this
castle
and
have
your
own
form
only
when
you
are
outside
the
walls
after
he
had
done
this
the
king
of
greece
went
home
to
his
own
country
taking
with
him
the
rod
of
enchantment
and
the
ring
of
youth
the
king
died
in
misery
and
grief
leaving
his
two
daughters
spellbound
now
there
was
a
druid
in
that
kingdom
and
the
younger
sister
went
to
consult
him
and
asked
shall
i
ever
be
released
from
the
enchantment
that
on
me
now
you
will
not
unless
you
find
the
man
to
release
you
and
there
is
no
man
in
the
world
to
do
that
but
a
champion
who
is
now
with
fin
maccumhail
in
erin
well
how
can
i
find
that
man
asked
she
i
will

the
druid

and
find
fin
and
his
men
the
man
that
the
shirt
will
fit
is
the
man
who
will
release
you
she
began
to
make
the
shirt
and
worked
without
stopping
till
it
was
finished
then
she
went
on
her
journey
and
never
rested
till
she
came
to
erin
in
a
ship
she
went
on
shore
and
inquired
where
fin
and
his
men
were
to
be
found
at
that
time
of
the
year
you
will
find
them
at
knock

the
answer

went
to

ar
carrying

with
her
the
first

she
met
was
conan
maol
and
she
said

time

till
cucúlin
put
it

an
og
told
cucúlin
all
that
had
happened
how
her
father
had
forced
her
sister
to
marry
the
king
of
greece
how
this
king
had
made
war
on
her
father
enchanted
her
sister
and
herself
and
carried
off
the
rod
of
enchantment
with
the
ring
of
youth
and
how
the
old
druid
said
the
man
this
shirt
would
fit
was
the
only
man
in
the
world
who
could
release
them
now
gil
an
og
and
cucúlin
went
to
the
ship
and
sailed
across
the
seas
to
her
country
and
went
to
her
castle
you
have
no
one
but
a
cat
for
company
said
gil
an
og
i

the
form
of
a

castle
but
outside
i
have
my

in
after
the
dinner
cucúlin
went
to
another
room
apart
and
lay
down
to
rest
after
the
journey
the
cat
came
to
his
pillow
sat
there
and
purred
till
he
fell
asleep
and
slept
soundly
till
morning
when
he
rose
up
a
basin
of
water
and
everything
he
needed
was
before
him
and
his
breakfast
ready
he
walked
out
after
breakfast
gil
an
og
was
on
the
green
outside
before
him
and
said
if
you
are
not
willing
to
free
my
sister
and
myself
i
shall
not
urge
you
but
if
you
do
free
us
i
shall
be
glad
and
thankful
many
sons
and
champions
before
you
have
gone
to
recover
the
ring
and
the
rod
but
they
have
never
come
back
well
whether
i
thrive
or
not
i
venture
said
cucúlin
i
will
give
you
said
gil
an
og
a
present
such
as
i
have
never
given
before
to
any
man
who
ventured
out
on
my
behalf
i
will
give
you
the
speckled
boat
cucúlin
took
leave
of
gil
an
og
and
sailed
away
in
the
speckled
boat
to
greece
where
he
went
to
the
king
court
and
challenged
him
to
combat
the
king
of
greece
gathered
his
forces
and
sent
them
out
to
chastise
cucúlin
he
killed
them
all
to
the
last
man
then
cucúlin
challenged
the
king
a
second
time
i
have
no
one
now
to
fight
but
myself
said
the
king
and
i
think
it
becomes
me
to
go
out
and
meet
the
like
of
you
if
you
do
come
out
to
me
said
cucúlin
i
go
in
to
you
and
cut
the
head
off
you
in
your
own
castle
that
enough
of
impudence
from
you
you
scoundrel
said
the
king
of
greece
i
wo
have
you
come
into
my
castle
but
i
meet
you
on
the
open
plain
the
king
went
out
and
they
fought
till
cucúlin
got
the
better
of
him
bound
him
head
and
heels
and
said
i
cut
the
head
off
you
now
unless
you
give
me
the
ring
of
youth
and
the
rod
of
enchantment
that
you
took
from
the
father
of
gil
an
og
well
i
did
carry
them
away
said
the
king
but
it
would
be
easy
for
me
now
to
give
them
to
you
or
to
her
for
there
was
a
man
who
came
and
carried
them
away
who
could
take
them
from
you
and
from
me
and
from
as
many
more
of
us
if
they
were
here
who
was
that
man
asked
cucúlin
his
name
said
the
king
is
lug
longhand
and
if
i
had
known
what
you
wanted
there
would
have
been
no
difference
between
us
i
tell
you
how
i
lost
the
ring
and
rod
and
i
go
with
you
and
show
you
where
lug
longhand
lives
but
do
you
come
to
my
castle
we
have
a
good
time
together
pronounced
loog
they
set
out
next
day
and
never
stopped
till
they
came
opposite
lug
longhand
castle
and
cucúlin
challenged
his
forces
to
combat
i
have
no
forces
said
lug
but
i
fight
you
myself
so
the
combat
began
and
they
spent
the
whole
day
at
one
another
and
neither
gained
the
victory
the
king
of
greece
himself
put
up
a
tent
on
the
green
in
front
of
the
castle
and
prepared
everything
necessary
to
eat
and
drink
there
was
no
one
else
to
do
it
after
breakfast
next
day
cucúlin
and
lug
began
fighting
again
the
king
of
greece
looked
on
as
the
day
before
they
fought
the
whole
day
till
near
evening
when
cucúlin
got
the
upper
hand
of
lug
longhand
and
bound
him
head
and
heels
saying
i
cut
the
head
off
you
now
unless
you
give
me
the
rod
and
the
ring
that
you
carried
away
from
the
king
of
greece
oh
then
said
lug
it
would
be
hard
for
me
to
give
them
to
you
or
to
him
for
forces
came
and
took
them
from
me
and
they
would
have
taken
them
from
you
and
from
him
if
you
had
been
here
who
in
the
world
took
them
from
you
asked
the
king
of
greece
release
me
from
this
bond
and
come
to
my
castle
and
i
tell
you
the
whole
story
said
lug
longhand
cucúlin
released
him
and
they
went
to
the
castle
they
got
good
reception
and
entertainment
from
lug
that
night
and
the
following
morning
as
well
he
said
the
ring
and
the
rod
were
taken
from
me
by
the
knight
of
the
island
of
the
flood
this
island
is
surrounded
by
a
chain
and
there
is
a
ring
of
fire
seven
miles
wide
between
the
chain
and
the
castle
no
man
can
come
near
the
island
without
breaking
the
chain
and
the
moment
the
chain
is
broken
the
fire
stops
burning
at
that
place
and
the
instant
the
fire
goes
down
the
knight
rushes
out
and
attacks
and
slays
every
man
that
before
him
the
king
of
greece
cucúlin
and
lug
longhand
now
sailed
on
in
the
speckled
boat
towards
the
island
of
the
flood
on
the
following
morning
when
the
speckled
boat
struck
the
chain
she
was
thrown
back
three
days
sail
and
was
near
being
sunk
and
would
have
gone
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
but
for
her
own
goodness
and
strength
as
soon
as
cucúlin
saw
what
had
happened
he
took
the
oars
rowed
on
again
and
drove
the
vessel
forward
with
such
venom
that
she
cut
through
the
chain
and
went
one
third
of
her
length
on
to
dry
land
that
moment
the
fire
was
quenched
where
the
vessel
struck
and
when
the
knight
of
the
island
saw
the
fire
go
out
he
rushed
to
the
shore
and
met
cucúlin
the
king
of
greece
and
lug
longhand
when
cucúlin
saw
him
he
threw
aside
his
weapons
caught
him
raised
him
above
his
head
hurled
him
down
on
the
flat
of
his
back
bound
him
head
and
heels
and
said
i
cut
the
head
off
you
unless
you
give
me
the
ring
and
the
rod
that
you
carried
away
from
lug
longhand
i
took
them
from
him
it
true
said
the
knight
but
it
would
be
hard
for
me
to
give
them
to
you
now
for
a
man
came
and
took
them
from
me
who
would
have
taken
them
from
you
and
all
that
are
with
you
and
as
many
more
if
they
had
been
here
before
him
who
in
the
world
could
that
man
be
asked
cucúlin
the
dark
gruagach
of
the
northern
island
release
me
and
come
to
my
castle
i
tell
you
all
and
entertain
you
well
he
took
them
to
his
castle
gave
them
good
cheer
and
told
them
all
about
the
gruagach
and
his
island
next
morning
all
sailed
away
in
cucúlin
vessel
which
they
had
left
at
the
shore
of
the
island
and
never
stopped
till
they
came
to
the
gruagach
castle
and
pitched
their
tents
in
front
of
it
then
cucúlin
challenged
the
gruagach
the
others
followed
after
to
know
would
he
thrive
the
gruagach
came
out
and
faced
cucúlin
and
they
began
and
spent
the
whole
day
at
one
another
and
neither
of
them
gained
the
upper
hand
when
evening
came
they
stopped
and
prepared
for
supper
and
the
night
next
day
after
breakfast
cucúlin
challenged
the
gruagach
again
and
they
fought
till
evening
when
cucúlin
got
the
better
in
the
struggle
disarmed
the
gruagach
bound
him
and
said
unless
you
give
up
the
rod
of
enchantment
and
the
ring
of
youth
that
you
took
from
the
knight
of
the
island
of
the
flood
i
cut
the
head
off
you
now
i
took
them
from
him
is
true
but
there
was
a
man
named
who
took
them
from
me
and
he
would
have
taken
them
from
you
and
from
me
and
all
that
are
here
if
there
were
twice
as
many
he
is
such
a
man
that
sword
can
not
cut
him
fire
can
not
burn
him
water
can
not
drown
him
and
is
no
easy
thing
to
get
the
better
of
him
but
if
you
free
me
now
and
come
to
my
castle
i
treat
you
well
and
tell
you
all
about
him
cucúlin
agreed
to
this
next
morning
they
would
not
stop
nor
be
satisfied
till
they
went
their
way
they
found
the
castle
of
and
cucúlin
challenged
him
to
combat
they
fought
and
he
was
cutting
the
flesh
from
cucúlin
but
cucúlin
sword
cut
no
flesh
from
him
they
fought
till
cucúlin
said
it
is
time
now
to
stop
till
cucúlin
was
scarcely
able
to
reach
the
tent
they
had
to
support
him
and
put
him
to
bed
now
who
should
come
to
cucúlin
that
night
but
gil
an
og
and
she
said
you
have
gone
further
than
any
man
before
you
and
i
cure
you
now
and
you
need
go
no
further
for
the
rod
of
enchantment
and
the
ring
of
youth
well
said
cucúlin
i
never
give
over
till
i
knock
another
trial
out
of
when
it
was
time
for
rest
gil
an
og
went
away
and
cucúlin
fell
asleep
for
himself
on
the
following
morning
all
his
comrades
were
up
and
facing
his
tent
they
thought
to
see
him
dead
but
he
was
in
as
good
health
as
ever
they
prepared
breakfast
and
after
breakfast
cucúlin
went
before
the
door
of
the
castle
to
challenge
his
enemy
thrust
his
head
out
and
said
that
man
i
fought
yesterday
has
come
again
it
would
have
been
a
good
deed
if
i
had
cut
the
head
off
him
last
night
then
he
would
be
here
to
trouble
me
this
morning
i
wo
come
home
this
day
till
i
bring
his
head
with
me
then
i
have
peace
they
met
in
combat
and
fought
till
the
night
was
coming
then
cried
out
for
a
cessation
and
if
he
did
cucúlin
was
glad
to
give
it
for
his
sword
had
no
effect
upon
except
to
tire
and
nearly
kill
him
he
was
enchanted
and
no
arms
could
cut
him
when
went
to
his
castle
he
threw
up
three
sups
of
blood
and
said
to
his
housekeeper
though
his
sword
could
not
penetrate
me
he
has
nearly
broken
my
heart
cucúlin
had
to
be
carried
to
his
tent
his
comrades
laid
him
on
his
bed
and
said
whoever
came
and
healed
him
yesterday
may
be
the
same
will
be
here
they
went
away
and
were
not
long
gone
when
gil
an
og
came
and
said
cucúlin
if
you
had
done
my
bidding
you
would
be
as
you
are
but
if
you
neglect
my
words
now
you
never
see
my
face
again
i
cure
you
this
time
and
make
you
as
well
as
ever
and
whatever
virtue
she
had
she
healed
him
so
he
was
as
strong
as
before
oh
then
said
cucúlin
whatever
comes
on
me
i
never
turn
back
till
i
knock
another
day
trial
out
of
well
said
she
you
are
a
stronger
man
than
he
but
there
is
no
good
in
working
at
him
with
a
sword
throw
your
sword
aside
and
you
get
the
better
of
him
and
bind
him
you
not
see
me
again
she
went
away
and
he
fell
asleep
his
comrades
came
in
the
morning
and
found
him
sleeping
they
got
breakfast
and
after
eating
cucúlin
went
out
and
called
a
challenge
oh
is
the
same
man
as
yesterday
said
and
if
i
had
cut
the
head
off
him
then
it
would
be
he
that
would
trouble
me
if
i
live
for
it
i
bring
his
head
in
my
hand
and
he
never
disturb
me
again
when
cucúlin
saw
coming
he
threw
his
sword
aside
and
facing
him
caught
him
by
the
body
raised
him
up
then
dashed
him
to
the
ground
and
said
if
you
do
give
me
what
i
want
i
cut
the
head
off
you
what
do
you
want
of
me
asked
i
want
the
rod
of
enchantment
and
the
ring
of
youth
you
carried
from
the
gruagach
i
did
indeed
carry
them
from
him
but
it
would
be
no
easy
thing
for
me
to
give
them
to
you
or
any
other
man
for
a
force
came
which
took
them
from
me
what
could
take
them
from
you
asked
cucúlin
the
queen
of
the
wilderness
an
old
hag
that
has
them
now
but
release
me
from
this
bondage
and
i
take
you
to
my
castle
and
entertain
you
well
and
i
go
with
you
and
the
rest
of
the
company
to
see
how
will
you
thrive
so
he
took
cucúlin
and
his
friends
to
the
castle
and
entertained
them
joyously
and
he
said
the
old
hag
the
queen
of
the
wilderness
lives
in
a
round
tower
which
is
always
turning
on
wheels
there
is
but
one
entrance
to
the
tower
and
that
high
above
the
ground
and
in
the
one
chamber
in
which
she
lives
keeping
the
ring
and
the
rod
is
a
chair
and
she
has
but
to
sit
on
the
chair
and
wish
herself
in
any
part
of
the
world
and
that
moment
she
is
there
she
has
six
lines
of
guards
protecting
her
tower
and
if
you
pass
all
of
these
you
do
what
no
man
before
you
has
done
to
this
day
the
first
guards
are
two
lions
that
rush
out
to
know
which
of
them
will
get
the
first
bite
out
of
the
throat
of
any
one
that
tries
to
pass
the
second
are
seven
men
with
iron
hurlies
and
an
iron
ball
and
with
their
hurlies
they
wallop
the
life
out
of
any
man
that
goes
their
way
the
third
is
who
hangs
on
a
tree
with
his
toes
to
the
earth
his
head
cut
from
his
shoulders
and
lying
on
the
ground
and
who
kills
every
man
who
comes
near
him
the
fourth
is
the
bull
of
the
mist
that
darkens
the
woods
for
seven
miles
around
and
destroys
everything
that
enters
the
mist
the
fifth
are
seven
cats
with
poison
tails
and
one
drop
of
their
poison
would
kill
the
strongest
man
next
morning
all
went
with
cucúlin
as
far
as
the
lions
who
guarded
the
queen
of
the
wilderness
an
old
hag
made
young
by
the
ring
of
youth
the
two
lions
ran
at
cucúlin
to
see
which
would
have
the
first
bite
out
of
him
cucúlin
wore
a
red
silk
scarf
around
his
neck
and
had
a
fine
head
of
hair
he
cut
the
hair
off
his
head
and
wound
it
around
one
hand
took
his
scarf
and
wrapped
it
around
the
other
then
rushing
at
the
lions
he
thrust
a
hand
down
the
throat
of
each
lion
for
lions
can
bite
neither
silk
nor
hair
he
pulled
the
livers
and
lights
out
of
the
two
and
they
fell
dead
before
him
his
comrades
looking
on
said
you
thrive
now
since
you
have
done
this
deed
and
they
left
him
and
went
home
each
to
his
own
country
cucúlin
went
further
the
next
people
he
met
were
the
seven
men
with
the
iron
hurlies
ball
clubs
and
they
said
is
long
since
any
man
walked
this
way
to
us
we
have
sport
now
the
first
one
said
give
him
a
touch
of
the
hurly
and
let
the
others
do
the
same
and
we
wallop
him
till
he
is
dead
now
cucúlin
drew
his
sword
and
cut
the
head
off
the
first
man
before
he
could
make
an
offer
of
the
hurly
at
him
and
then
he
did
the
same
to
the
other
six
he
went
on
his
way
till
he
came
to
who
was
hanging
from
a
tree
his
head
on
the
ground
near
him
the
queen
of
the
wilderness
had
fastened
him
to
the
tree
because
he
would
marry
her
and
she
said
if
any
man
comes
who
will
put
your
head
on
you
you
be
free
and
she
laid
the
injunction
on
him
to
kill
every
man
who
tried
to
pass
his
way
without
putting
the
head
on
him
cucúlin
went
up
looked
at
him
and
saw
heaps
of
bones
around
the
tree
the
body
said
you
ca
go
by
here
i
fight
with
every
man
who
tries
to
pass
well
i
not
going
to
fight
with
a
man
unless
he
has
a
head
on
him
take
your
head
and
cucúlin
picking
up
the
head
clapped
it
on
the
body
and
said
now
i
fight
with
you
the
man
said
i
all
right
now
i
know
where
you
are
going
i
stay
here
till
you
come
if
you
conquer
you
not
forget
me
take
the
head
off
me
now
put
it
where
you
found
it
and
if
you
succeed
remember
that
i
shall
be
here
before
you
on
your
way
home
cucúlin
went
on
but
soon
met
the
bull
of
the
mist
that
covered
seven
miles
of
the
wood
with
thick
mist
when
the
bull
saw
him
he
made
at
him
and
stuck
a
horn
in
his
ribs
and
threw
him
three
miles
into
the
wood
against
a
great
oak
tree
and
broke
three
ribs
in
his
side
well
said
cucúlin
when
he
recovered
if
i
get
another
throw
like
that
i
not
be
good
for
much
exercise
he
was
barely
on
his
feet
when
the
bull
was
at
him
again
but
when
he
came
up
he
caught
the
bull
by
both
horns
and
away
they
went
wrestling
and
struggling
for
three
days
and
nights
cucúlin
kept
the
bull
in
play
till
the
morning
of
the
fourth
day
when
he
put
him
on
the
flat
of
his
back
then
he
turned
him
on
the
side
and
putting
a
foot
on
one
horn
and
taking
the
other
in
his
two
hands
he
said
is
well
i
earned
you
there
is
not
a
stitch
on
me
that
is
torn
to
rags
from
wrestling
with
you
he
pulled
the
bull
asunder
from
his
horns
to
his
tail
into
two
equal
parts
and
said
now
that
i
have
you
in
two
it
in
quarters
i
put
you
he
took
his
sword
and
when
he
struck
the
backbone
of
the
bull
the
sword
remained
in
the
bone
and
he
could
pull
it
out
he
walked
away
and
stood
awhile
and
looked
is
hard
to
say
said
he
that
any
good
champion
would
leave
his
sword
behind
him
so
he
went
back
and
made
another
pull
and
took
the
hilt
off
his
sword
leaving
the
blade
in
the
back
of
the
bull
then
he
went
away
tattered
and
torn
the
hilt
in
his
hand
and
he
turned
up
towards
the
forge
of
the
strong
smith
one
of
the
smith
boys
was
out
for
coal
at
the
time
he
saw
cucúlin
coming
with
the
hilt
in
his
hand
and
ran
in
saying
there
is
a
man
coming
up
and
he
looks
like
a
fool
we
have
fun
hold
your
tongue
said
the
master
have
you
heard
any
account
of
the
bull
of
the
mist
these
three
days
we
have
not
said
the
boys
perhaps
said
the
strong
smith
that
a
good
champion
that
coming
and
do
you
mind
yourselves
at
that
moment
cucúlin
walked
in
to
the
forge
where
twelve
boys
and
the
master
were
working
he
saluted
them
and
asked
can
you
put
a
blade
in
this
hilt
we
can
said
the
master
they
put
in
the
blade
cucúlin
raised
the
sword
and
took
a
shake
out
of
it
and
broke
it
to
bits
this
is
a
rotten
blade
said
he
go
at
it
again
they
made
a
second
blade
the
boys
were
in
dread
of
him
now
he
broke
the
second
blade
in
the
same
way
as
the
first
they
made
six
blades
one
stronger
than
the
other
he
did
the
same
to
them
all
there
is
no
use
in
talking
said
the
strong
smith
we
have
no
stuff
that
would
make
a
right
blade
for
you
go
down
now
said
he
to
two
of
the
boys
and
bring
up
an
old
sword
that
down
in
the
stable
full
of
rust
they
went
and
brought
up
the
sword
on
two
between
them
it
was
so
heavy
that
one
could
carry
it
they
gave
it
to
cucúlin
and
with
one
blow
on
his
heel
he
knocked
the
dust
from
it
and
went
out
at
the
door
and
took
a
shake
out
of
it
and
if
he
did
he
darkened
the
whole
place
with
the
rust
from
the
blade
this
is
my
sword
whoever
made
it
said
he
it
is
said
the
master
it
yours
and
welcome
i
know
who
you
are
now
and
where
you
are
going
remember
that
i
in
bondage
here
the
strong
smith
took
cucúlin
then
to
his
house
gave
him
refreshment
and
clothes
for
the
journey
when
he
was
ready
the
smith
said
i
hope
you
thrive
you
have
done
a
deal
more
than
any
man
that
ever
walked
this
way
before
there
is
nothing
now
to
stand
in
your
way
till
you
come
to
the
seven
cats
outside
the
turning
tower
if
they
shake
their
tails
and
a
drop
of
poison
comes
on
you
it
will
penetrate
to
your
heart
you
must
sweep
off
their
tails
with
your
sword
is
equal
to
you
what
their
bodies
will
do
after
that
cucúlin
soon
came
to
them
and
there
was
one
of
the
seven
cats
he
did
strip
of
her
tail
before
she
knew
he
was
in
it
he
cared
nothing
for
the
bodies
so
he
had
the
tails
the
cats
ran
away
now
he
faced
the
tower
turning
on
wheels
the
queen
of
the
wilderness
was
in
it
he
had
been
told
by
that
he
must
cut
the
axle
he
found
the
axle
cut
it
and
the
tower
stopped
that
instant
cucúlin
made
a
spring
and
went
in
through
the
single
passage
the
old
hag
was
preparing
to
sit
on
the
chair
as
she
saw
him
coming
he
sprang
forward
pushed
the
chair
away
with
one
hand
and
catching
her
by
the
back
of
the
neck
with
the
other
said
you
are
to
lose
your
head
now
old
woman
spare
me
and
what
you
want
you
get
said
she
i
have
the
ring
of
youth
and
the
rod
of
enchantment
and
she
gave
them
to
him
he
put
the
ring
on
his
finger
and
saying
you
never
do
mischief
again
to
man
he
turned
her
face
to
the
entrance
and
gave
her
a
kick
out
she
flew
through
the
opening
and
down
to
the
ground
where
she
broke
her
neck
and
died
on
the
spot
cucúlin
made
the
strong
smith
king
over
all
the
dominions
of
the
queen
of
the
wilderness
and
proclaimed
that
any
person
in
the
country
who
refused
to
obey
the
new
king
would
be
put
to
death
cucúlin
turned
back
at
once
and
travelled
till
he
came
to
he
took
him
down
and
putting
the
head
on
his
body
struck
him
a
blow
of
the
rod
and
made
the
finest
looking
man
of
him
that
could
be
found
the
man
went
back
to
his
own
home
happy
and
well
cucúlin
never
stopped
till
he
came
to
the
castle
of
gil
an
og
she
was
outside
with
a
fine
welcome
before
him
and
why
not
to
be
sure
for
he
had
the
rod
of
enchantment
and
the
ring
of
youth
when
she
entered
the
castle
and
took
the
form
of
a
cat
he
struck
her
a
blow
of
the
rod
and
she
gained
the
same
form
and
face
she
had
before
the
king
of
greece
struck
her

the
moment

lake
the

rose
up
near
them
then
cucúlin
struck
her
with
the
rod
and
she
came
to

shape
and
countenance

they
saw
a

cucúlin
found
a
great
white
stone
he
grasped
his
sword
in
his
right
hand
and
cried
out
if
i
had
the
head
of
the
woman
who
sent
her
son
into
peril
of
death
at
my
hand
i
split
it
as
i
split
this
stone
and
he
made
four
quarters
of
the
stone
then
he
strove
with
the
waves
seven
days
and
nights
till
he
fell
from
hunger
and
weakness
and
the
waves
went
over
him
oisin
in
tir
na
there
was
a
king
in
tir
na
the
land
of
youth
who
held
the
throne
and
crown
for
many
a
year
against
all
comers
and
the
law
of
the
kingdom
was
that
every
seventh
year
the
champions
and
best
men
of
the
country
should
run
for
the
office
of
king
once
in
seven
years
they
all
met
at
the
front
of
the
palace
and
ran
to
the
top
of
a
hill
two
miles
distant
on
the
top
of
that
hill
was
a
chair
and
the
man
that
sat
first
in
the
chair
was
king
of
tir
na
for
the
next
seven
years
after
he
had
ruled
for
ages
the
king
became
anxious
he
was
afraid
that
some
one
might
sit
in
the
chair
before
him
and
take
the
crown
off
his
head
so
he
called
up
his
druid
one
day
and
asked
how
long
shall
i
keep
the
chair
to
rule
this
land
and
will
any
man
sit
in
it
before
me
and
take
the
crown
off
my
head
you
will
keep
the
chair
and
the
crown
forever
said
the
druid
unless
your
own
takes
them
from
you
the
king
had
no
sons
and
but
one
daughter
the
finest
woman
in
tir
na
and
the
like
of
her
could
not
be
found
in
erin
or
any
kingdom
in
the
world
when
the
king
heard
the
words
of
the
druid
he
said
have
no
for
i
put
the
daughter
in
a
way
no
man
will
marry
her
then
he
took
a
rod
of
druidic
spells
and
calling
the
daughter
up
before
him
he
struck
her
with
the
rod
and
put
a
pig
head
on
her
in
place
of
her
own
then
he
sent
the
daughter
away
to
her
own
place
in
the
castle
and
turning
to
the
druid
said
there
is
no
man
that
will
marry
her
now
when
the
druid
saw
the
face
that
was
on
the
princess
with
the
pig
head
that
the
father
gave
her
he
grew
very
sorry
that
he
had
given
such
information
to
the
king
and
some
time
after
he
went
to
see
the
princess
must
i
be
in
this
way
forever
asked
she
of
the
druid
you
must
said
he
till
you
marry
one
of
the
sons
of
fin
maccumhail
in
erin
if
you
marry
one
of
fin
sons
you
be
freed
from
the
blot
that
is
on
you
now
and
get
back
your
own
head
and
countenance
when
she
heard
this
she
was
impatient
in
her
mind
and
could
never
rest
till
she
left
tir
na
and
came
to
erin
when
she
had
inquired
she
heard
that
fin
and
the
fenians
of
erin
were
at
that
time
living
on
knock
an
ar
and
she
made
her
way
to
the
place
without
delay
and
lived
there
a
while
and
when
she
saw
oisin
he
pleased
her
and
when
she
found
out
that
he
was
a
son
of
fin
maccumhail
she
was
always
making
up
to
him
and
coming
towards
him
and
it
was
usual
for
the
fenians
in
those
days
to
go
out
hunting
on
the
hills
and
mountains
and
in
the
woods
of
erin
and
when
one
of
them
went
he
always
took
five
or
six
men
with
him
to
bring
home
the
game
on
a
day
oisin
set
out
with
his
men
and
dogs
to
the
woods
and
he
went
so
far
and
killed
so
much
game
that
when
it
was
brought
together
the
men
were
so
tired
weak
and
hungry
that
they
could
carry
it
but
went
away
home
and
left
him
with
the
three
dogs
bran
sciolán
and
buglén
to
shift
for
himself
celebrated
dogs
of
fin
maccumhail
now
the
daughter
of
the
king
of
tir
na
who
was
herself
the
queen
of
youth
followed
closely
in
the
hunt
all
that
day
and
when
the
men
left
oisin
she
came
up
to
him
and
as
he
stood
looking
at
the
great
pile
of
game
and
said
i
am
very
sorry
to
leave
behind
anything
that
had
the
trouble
of
killing
she
looked
at
him
and
said
tie
up
a
bundle
for
me
and
i
carry
it
to
lighten
the
load
off
you
oisin
gave
her
a
bundle
of
the
game
to
carry
and
took
the
remainder
himself
the
evening
was
very
warm
and
the
game
heavy
and
after
they
had
gone
some
distance
oisin
said
let
us
rest
a
while
both
threw
down
their
burdens
and
put
their
backs
against
a
great
stone
that
was
by
the
roadside
the
woman
was
heated
and
out
of
breath
and
opened
her
dress
to
cool
herself
then
oisin
looked
at
her
and
saw
her
beautiful
form
and
her
white
bosom
oh
then
said
he
it
a
pity
you
have
the
pig
head
on
you
for
i
have
never
seen
such
an
appearance
on
a
woman
in
all
my
life
before
well
said
she
my
father
is
the
king
of
tir
na
and
i
was
the
finest
woman
in
his
kingdom
and
the
most
beautiful
of
all
till
he
put
me
under
a
druidic
spell
and
gave
me
the
pig
head
that
on
me
now
in
place
of
my
own
and
the
druid
of
tir
na
came
to
me
afterwards
and
told
me
that
if
one
of
the
sons
of
fin
maccumhail
would
marry
me
the
pig
head
would
vanish
and
i
should
get
back
my
face
in
the
same
form
as
it
was
before
my
father
struck
me
with
the
druid
wand
when
i
heard
this
i
never
stopped
till
i
came
to
erin
where
i
found
your
father
and
picked
you
out
among
the
sons
of
fin
maccumhail
and
followed
you
to
see
would
you
marry
me
and
set
me
free
if
that
is
the
state
you
are
in
and
if
marriage
with
me
will
free
you
from
the
spell
i
not
leave
the
pig
head
on
you
long
so
they
got
married
without
delay
not
waiting
to
take
home
the
game
or
to
lift
it
from
the
ground
that
moment
the
pig
head
was
gone
and
the
king
daughter
had
the
same
face
and
beauty
that
she
had
before
her
father
struck
her
with
the
druidic
wand
now
said
the
queen
of
youth
to
oisin
i
can
not
stay
here
long
and
unless
you
come
with
me
to
tir
na
we
must
part
oh
said
oisin
wherever
you
go
i
go
and
wherever
you
turn
follow
then
she
turned
and
oisin
went
with
her
not
going
back
to
knock
an
ar
to
see
his
father
or
his
son
that
very
day
they
set
out
for
tir
na
and
never
stopped
till
they
came
to
her
father
castle
and
when
they
came
there
was
a
welcome
before
them
for
the
king
thought
his
daughter
was
lost
that
same
year
there
was
to
be
a
choice
of
a
king
and
when
the
appointed
day
came
at
the
end
of
the
seventh
year
all
the
great
men
and
the
champions
and
the
king
himself
met
together
at
the
front
of
the
castle
to
run
and
see
who
should
be
first
in
the
chair
on
the
hill
but
before
a
man
of
them
was
halfway
to
the
hill
oisin
was
sitting
above
in
the
chair
before
them
after
that
time
no
one
stood
up
to
run
for
the
office
against
oisin
and
he
spent
many
a
happy
year
as
king
in
tir
na
at
last
he
said
to
his
wife
i
wish
i
could
be
in
erin
to
see
my
father
and
his
men
if
you
go
said
his
wife
and
set
foot
on
the
land
of
erin
never
come
back
here
to
me
and
you
become
a
blind
old
man
how
long
do
you
think
it
is
since
you
came
here
about
three
years
said
oisin
it
is
three
hundred
years
said
she
since
you
came
to
this
kingdom
with
me
if
you
must
go
to
erin
give
you
this
white
steed
to
carry
you
but
if
you
come
down
from
the
steed
or
touch
the
soil
of
erin
with
your
foot
the
steed
will
come
back
that
minute
and
you
be
where
he
left
you
a
poor
old
man
i
come
back
never
fear
said
oisin
have
i
not
good
reason
to
come
back
but
i
must
see
my
father
and
my
son
and
my
friends
in
erin
once
more
i
must
have
even
one
look
at
them
she
prepared
the
steed
for
oisin
and
said
this
steed
will
carry
you
wherever
you
wish
to
go
oisin
never
stopped
till
the
steed
touched
the
soil
of
erin
and
he
went
on
till
he
came
to
knock
patrick
in
munster
where
he
saw
a
man
herding
cows
in
the
field
where
the
cows
were
grazing
there
was
a
broad
flat
stone
will
you
come
here
said
oisin
to
the
herdsman
and
turn
over
this
stone
indeed
then
i
will
not
said
the
herdsman
for
i
could
not
lift
it
nor
twenty
men
more
like
me
oisin
rode
up
to
the
stone
and
reaching
down
caught
it
with
his
hand
and
turned
it
over
underneath
the
stone
was
the
great
horn
of
the
fenians
which
circled
round
like
a
seashell
and
it
was
the
rule
that
when
any
of
the
fenians
of
erin
blew
the
borabu
the
others
would
assemble
at
once
from
whatever
part
of
the
country
they
might
be
in
at
the
time
will
you
bring
this
horn
to
me
asked
oisin
of
the
herdsman
i
will
not
said
the
herdsman
for
neither
i
nor
many
more
like
me
could
raise
it
from
the
ground
with
that
oisin
moved
near
the
horn
and
reaching
down
took
it
in
his
hand
but
so
eager
was
he
to
blow
it
that
he
forgot
everything
and
slipped
in
reaching
till
one
foot
touched
the
earth
in
an
instant
the
steed
was
gone
and
oisin
lay
on
the
ground
a
blind
old
man
the
herdsman
went
to
saint
patrick
who
lived
near
by
and
told
him
what
had
happened
saint
patrick
sent
a
man
and
a
horse
for
oisin
brought
him
to
his
own
house
gave
him
a
room
by
himself
and
sent
a
boy
to
stay
with
him
to
serve
and
take
care
of
him
and
saint
patrick
commanded
his
cook
to
send
oisin
plenty
of
meat
and
drink
to
give
him
bread
and
beef
and
butter
every
day
now
oisin
lived
a
while
in
this
way
the
cook
sent
him
provisions
each
day
and
saint
patrick
himself
asked
him
all
kinds
of
questions
about
the
old
times
of
the
fenians
of
erin
oisin
told
him
about
his
father
fin
maccumhail
about
himself
his
son
osgar
goll
macmorna
conan
maol
diarmuid
and
all
the
fenian
heroes
how
they
fought
feasted
and
hunted
how
they
came
under
druidic
spells
and
how
they
were
freed
from
them
at
the
same
time
saint
patrick
was
putting
up
a
great
building
but
what
his
men
used
to
put
up
in
the
daytime
was
levelled
at
night
and
saint
patrick
lamented
over
his
losses
in
the
hearing
of
oisin
then
oisin
said
in
the
hearing
of
saint
patrick
if
i
had
my
strength
and
my
sight
i
put
a
stop
to
the
power
that
is
levelling
your
work
do
you
think
you
be
able
to
do
that
said
saint
patrick
and
let
my
building
go
on
i
do
indeed
said
oisin
so
saint
patrick
prayed
to
the
lord
and
the
sight
and
strength
came
back
to
oisin
he
went
to
the
woods
and
got
a
great
club
and
stood
at
the
building
on
guard
what
should
come
in
the
night
but
a
great
beast
in
the
form
of
a
bull
which
began
to
uproot
and
destroy
the
work
but
if
he
did
oisin
faced
him
and
the
battle
began
hot
and
heavy
between
the
two
but
in
the
course
of
the
night
oisin
got
the
upper
hand
of
the
bull
and
left
him
dead
before
the
building
then
he
stretched
out
on
the
ground
himself
and
fell
asleep
now
saint
patrick
was
waiting
at
home
to
know
how
would
the
battle
come
out
and
thinking
oisin
too
long
away
he
sent
a
messenger
to
the
building
and
when
the
messenger
came
he
saw
the
ground
torn
up
a
hill
in
one
place
and
a
hollow
in
the
next
the
bull
was
dead
and
oisin
sleeping
after
the
desperate
battle
he
went
back
and
told
what
he
saw
oh
said
saint
patrick
it
better
to
knock
the
strength
out
of
him
again
for
he
kill
us
all
if
he
gets
vexed
saint
patrick
took
the
strength
out
of
him
and
when
oisin
woke
up
he
was
a
blind
old
man
and
the
messenger
went
out
and
brought
him
home
oisin
lived
on
for
a
time
as
before
the
cook
sent
him
his
food
the
boy
served
him
and
saint
patrick
listened
to
the
stories
of
the
fenians
of
erin
saint
patrick
had
a
neighbor
a
jew
a
very
rich
man
but
the
greatest
miser
in
the
kingdom
and
he
had
the
finest
haggart
of
corn
in
erin
well
the
jew
and
saint
patrick
got
very
intimate
with
one
another
and
so
great
became
the
friendship
of
the
jew
for
saint
patrick
at
last
that
he
said
he
give
him
for
the
support
of
his
house
as
much
corn
as
one
man
could
thrash
out
of
the
haggart
in
a
day
haggart
when
saint
patrick
went
home
after
getting
the
promise
of
the
corn
he
told
in
the
hearing
of
oisin
about
what
the
jew
had
said
oh
then
said
oisin
if
i
had
my
sight
and
strength
i
thrash
as
much
corn
in
one
day
as
would
do
your
whole
house
for
a
twelvemonth
and
more
will
you
do
that
for
me
said
saint
patrick
i
will
said
oisin
saint
patrick
prayed
again
to
the
lord
and
the
sight
and
strength
came
back
to
oisin
he
went
to
the
woods
next
morning
at
daybreak
oisin
did
pulled
up
two
fine
and
made
a
flail
of
them
after
eating
his
breakfast
he
left
the
house
and
never
stopped
till
he
faced
the
haggart
of
the
jew
standing
before
one
of
the
stacks
of
wheat
he
hit
it
a
wallop
of
his
flail
and
broke
it
asunder
he
kept
on
in
this
way
till
he
slashed
the
whole
haggart
to
and
fro
and
the
jew
running
like
mad
up
and
down
the
highroad
in
front
of
the
haggart
tearing
the
hair
from
his
head
when
he
saw
what
was
doing
to
his
wheat
and
the
face
gone
from
him
entirely
he
was
so
in
dread
of
oisin
when
the
haggart
was
thrashed
clean
oisin
went
to
saint
patrick
and
told
him
to
send
his
men
for
the
wheat
for
he
had
thrashed
out
the
whole
haggart
when
saint
patrick
saw
the
countenance
that
was
on
oisin
and
heard
what
he
had
done
he
was
greatly
in
dread
of
him
and
knocked
the
strength
out
of
him
again
and
oisin
became
an
old
blind
man
as
before
saint
patrick
men
went
to
the
haggart
and
there
was
so
much
wheat
they
did
bring
the
half
of
it
away
with
them
and
they
did
want
it
oisin
again
lived
for
a
while
as
before
and
then
he
was
vexed
because
the
cook
did
give
him
what
he
wanted
he
told
saint
patrick
that
he
was
getting
enough
to
eat
then
saint
patrick
called
up
the
cook
before
himself
and
oisin
and
asked
her
what
she
was
giving
oisin
to
eat
she
said
i
give
him
at
every
meal
what
bread
is
baked
on
a
large
griddle
and
all
the
butter
i
make

saint

blackbird
bigger
than

quarter
of

bread
for

and
i
have
often
seen

oisin
said

hide
of
the
ox

it
up
in
this
room
when
the
hide
was
hung

oisin
said

the
three
whelps
and
throw
them
up
against

boy
threw
up
one
of
the
whelps

the
boy
did
as
he
was

well
and
when
the
whelp
grew
up
the
mother
was
banished
the
whelp
chained
up
and
fed
for
a
year
and
a
day
and
when
the
year
and
a
day
were
spent
oisin
said
we
go
hunting
and
we
take
the
dog
with
us
they
went
next
day
the
boy
guiding
oisin
holding
the
dog
by
a
chain
they
went
first
to
the
place
where
oisin
had
touched
earth
and
lost
the
magic
steed
from
tir
na
the
borabu
of
the
fenians

ground
there
still
oisin
took
it
up
and
they
went
on
to
glen
na
smuil
thrush
glen
when
at
the
edge
of
the
glen
oisin
began
to
sound
the
borabu
birds
and
beasts
of
every
kind
came
hurrying
forward
he
blew
the
horn
till
the
glen
was
full
of
them
from

oisin
what

hair
on
his
body
that

said
oisin
the
boy
let

the
chain
and
the
dog
rushed
through
the
glen
killing
everything
before
him
when
all
the
others
were
dead
he
turned
to
the
great
blackbird
and
killed
that
then
he
faced
oisin
and
the
boy
and
came
bounding
toward
them
with
venom
and
fierceness
oisin
drew
out
of
his
bosom
a
brass
ball
and
said

into
the
dog
mouth

ball
or

the
ball
i
so
in
dread
of
the
dog

here
at
my
back
then
said
oisin
and
straighten
my
hand
towards
the
dog
the
boy
directed
the
hand
and
oisin
threw
the
ball
into
the
dog
mouth
and
killed
him
on
the
spot
what
have
we
done
asked
oisin
oh

the
boy

said
oisin
and
do
you
lead
me
now
to
the
blackbird
of
the
carn

the
others
they
went
to
the
great
bird
kindled
a
fire
and
cooked
all
except
one
of
its
legs
then
oisin
ate
as
much
as
he
wanted
and
said
i
had
a
good
meal
of
my
own
hunting
and
it
many
and
many
a
day
since
i
have
had
one
now
let
us
go
on
farther
they
went
into
the
woods
and
soon
oisin
asked
the
boy
do
you
see
anything
wonderful
i
see
an
ivy
with
the
largest
leaves
i
have
ever
set
eyes
on
take
one
leaf
of
that
ivy
said
oisin
the
boy
took
the
leaf
near
the
ivy
they
found
a
rowan
berry
and
then
went
home
taking
the
three
things
with
them
the
blackbird
leg
the
ivy
leaf
and
the
rowan
berry
when
they
reached
the
house
oisin
called
for
the
cook
and
saint
patrick
made
her
come
to
the
fore
when
she
came
oisin
pointed
to
the
blackbird
leg
and
asked
which
is
larger
that
leg
or
the
quarter
of
beef
you
give
me
oh
that
is
a
deal
larger
said
the
cook
you
were
right
in
that
case
said
saint
patrick
to
oisin
then
oisin
drew
out
the
ivy
leaf
and
asked
which
is
larger
this
or
the
griddle
on
which
you
made
bread
for
me
that
is
larger
than
the
griddle
and
the
bread
together
said
the
cook
right
again
said
saint
patrick
oisin
now
took
out
the
rowan
berry
and
asked
which
is
larger
this
berry
or
the
butter
of
one
churning
which
you
give
me
oh
that
is
bigger
said
the
cook
than
both
the
churn
and
the
butter
right
every
time
said
saint
patrick
then
oisin
raised
his
arm
and
swept
the
head
off
the
cook
with
a
stroke
from
the
edge
of
his
hand
saying
you
never
give
the
lie
to
an
honest
man

said
by
my

aedh
curucha
maol
the
gaelic
thersites
always

unpopular
and

this
species
of

as
well
known
in

mythology
of
the
north
american
indians
as
in

sounded
as
if
one
were
to
begin
to
utter
after
it
one
of
the
most
remarkable
characters
in
gaelic
mythology
a
great
hunter
and
performer
of
marvellous
feats
the
prominent
event
of
his
life
was
the
carrying
off
of
grainne
bride
of
fin
maccumhail
at
her
own
command
after
many
years
of
baffled
pursuit
fin
was
forced
to
make
peace
but
he
contrived
at
last
to
bring
about
diarmuid
death
by
causing
him
to
hunt
an
enchanted
boar
of
green
color
and
without
ears
or
tail
the
account
of
this
pursuit
and
the
death
of
diarmuid
forms
one
of
the
celebrated
productions
of
gaelic
literature
diarmuid
had
a
mole
on
his
forehead
which
he
kept
covered
usually
but
when
it
was
laid
bare
and
a
woman
saw
it
she
fell
in
love
with
him
beyond
recall
this
was
why
grainne
deserted
fin
not
after
she
was
married
but
at
the
feast
of
betrothal
the
evident
meaning
of
the
word
is
bright
or
it
is
very
interesting
to
find
diarmuid
called
also
son
of
the
monarch
of
light
